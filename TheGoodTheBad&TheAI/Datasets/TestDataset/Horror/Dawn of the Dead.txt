You, me, Gary, Brad.
We'll be teeing off at--
Well, I like Gary.
Dr. Dandewar, I'm kind of
in a bit of a hurry.
We'll be teeing off at 7:30,
and if you're not there because
of Gary, well, come on, you know.
I gotta go.
Am I missing something?
Why did Dr. Cho order a head X-ray
when the man was bitten on the hand?
Uh, the patient
was in a bar fight.
He was communicative
when he was admitted at 6:00.
That's 6:00 a.m.
This morning.
That's when I started my shift.
Where's the patient now?
I'd like to see him.
They moved him.
I'm sure one of the night nurses
can tell you--
Sure.
I'll do that.
Hey, Cora, can you do me a favor
and locate a patient for me?
Hey, Ana.
Edward Solomon?
Yeah.
- Aren't you off?
- An hour ago.
Here he is.
They had him backward.
Solomon Edward.
He's upstairs in I.C.U.
From a bite?
I don't know what from.
Toxicology is gonna
work him up in the morning.
Okay, I'm gonna get outta here.
Can you do me a favor?
Can you page Dr. Dandewar
and let him know?
Sure.
Thanks.
You, uh, talk to Luis
about Sunday?
- I will. Night, Cora.
- Night.
Hey.
Hey, Ana?
Let's go.
It's starting early.
Let's go! Let's go!
Unconfirmed reports--
Confirmed
it is not an isolated--
%%
Hey, Vivian.
Ana, look.
I can go backwards.
Let me see.
Hey, that's amazing!
Maybe tomorrow after work
I'll do a few backward laps
around the block with you, okay?
Okay.
All right. Careful now.
I gotta pull in.
Say hey to your mom
for me, okay?
Okay.
Hey.
Hey, you. You're late.
You missed it. They just cut
the mailman loose.
No, Richie?
The chubby one?
Oh, my God.
He had such a sweet voice.
I can't believe that.
Hey, you.
How'd it go today?
Not bad. You?
Good. I'm trading shifts
with Cora, so if I take Sunday,
I can have a three-day weekend
at the end of the month.
Is that okay?
Sunday. Yeah.
Yeah.
I think Cora's got this new guy
she doesn't want me to know about.
Really. Wow.
Lucky her.
I thought maybe
you'd gone out with the girls
or something.
What, miss date night?
Twenty-seven horsepower,
turbo-charged, all--
Please stay tuned
to this special news bulletin.
Vivian, honey.
Sweetie, are you okay?
Oh, my God!
Oh, fuck!
Call an ambulance!
Vivian! Vivian!
-
- Luis! Luis! Luis!
Let go! Let go! Let go!
Let go! Let go! Let go!
I can't get it! I can't get it!
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
Let go! Let go! Let go, Luis!
I'm gonna call for help!
I'm gonna call for help!
-
- God, no. No, no, no!
-
- All circuits are busy.
Don't do this to me!
Please, don't do this to me!
All circuits are busy.
Luis?
- Luis, what are you doing?
-
Luis?
Help!
Get back, Ana.
Jesus,just tell me
what's going on.
I told you to get back.
...emergency broadcast
here in the Milwaukee area.
Help! Can you help?
Please, help!

- --
-
-
- Give me your car!
-
-
-
-
-
-
We don't know.
Listen. We lost a teleprompter.
Okay. A U.S.--
God, they're here!
Say somethin'.
Please.
All right! Okay!
Put the guns down!
What are you doing?
Come on. He's a cop!
I thought you were
one of them.
You do not wanna
go that way.
What's that way?
Officer, sir, you do not
wanna go that way.
- What's that way?
- It's pretty bad.
- What about Fort Pastor?
- Maybe if you had wings.
The road's thick
with those motherfuckers that way.
- How do you know?
- We just tried. Come on.
Back when there was eight of us.
We're going to the mall.
Shit.
%
Come on.
Sit right there.
We need to make sure
this place is safe.
I'm gonna see if the doors
over this way are locked.
I'll check down there.
Maybe, Officer, you could go
down that direction.
Check for--
All right. Okay.
Maybe it's better
you stay here with the gun.
Andre and I
will check around.
All right, baby,
I'll be right back.
No, no,just stay right here, okay?
Stay right here.
Shatterproof, asshole.
Shit!
-
-
Help me!
-
-
Hey, what happened?
Come on, move!
You all right?
Move!
Which way?
There.
Over this way.
Let's go! Let's go!
Can I see that arm?
We need to suture that.
Yeah.
You okay?
Yeah.
- Find someplace else.
- Look, we just need a place--
Maybe you didn't hear me.
There is no place else.
Yeah, and you already
trashed Metropolis.
Look, dumbass.
My wife is pregnant.
We can't run anymore.
His arm.
Those things are down there.
Well, these are
all your problems, not mine.
If I put my foot up your ass,
would that be your problem?
Hey, asshole, I'm the one
pointing the gun at you.
- He is a cop, C.J.
-
- So what.
-
Just let us stay here
for a little while. Please.
Okay.
Come out of there slowly,
and give your weapons
to Bart and Terry.
- Don't do it.
- You must be
out of your fuckin' mind.
You can take your ass
over to Quality Inn
if it's still there, Shaq.
Let's go.
Fuck.
Smart move.
Come on.
Got your own little TV.
Come on. Let's go.
Excuse me, please.
Is there a restroom?
No. You're staying here.
So then why don't you tell us
which spot in here you'd like us
to take a piss.
All right.
It's around the corner, that way.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where do you think you're going?
She's not going anywhere alone.
Come on.
Oh, well, she's not going any--
This is a fucking nursery school.
Terry, go with them.
I'm at one of the collection depots
waiting to interview
with Sheriff Cahill.
I understand you're having
a difficult time killing these things.
Just shoot 'em in the head.
They seem to go down permanently
when you shoot 'em in the head.
Then you gotta burn them.
We gotta burn--
- She's a twitcher.
- Twitcher.
Now that is one
cool motherfucker.
The bleeding's not
gonna stop.
I need to stitch his arm.
What are you,
a fucking doctor?
No, I'm a fucking nurse.
- I know some of these people
that we're putting down.
- First aid kit's in the security office.
What are you gonna do?
It's gotta be done.
Huh? What did I tell you, boys?
Get those bodies off the truck!
Haven't got all day here!
America always sorts
its shit out.
You know, you're lucky.
They could have bitten it off.
--
What can you tell
the people out there watching TV
that they'll know what to do?
What I would suggest is that
you come to Fort Pastor.
If you can't make it here,
we have multiple search-and-rescue teams
and they will find you.
My brother's there.
He's waiting for me.
What's the hold up, darling?
Hmm?
So what's the plan?
The plan is
you drink a nice tall glass
of shut the fuck up.
-
-
What about locking this place down?
'Cause sooner or later,
they're going to get in here.
Mm. That's good.
Like I hadn't thought of that.
Might be good.
Let 'em know we're alive.
We can get some paint
from Case Hardware.
We need some office doors
to board up the weak spots.
That's a solid plan.
C.J. is it?
Yeah.
All right, everybody, listen up.
You know what? Why don't you
start off by cleaning up
that mess you made in Metropolis?
Hey, C.J., look.
Terry, take a look
at Ben Cozine.
Hey, Ben. Ben!
Christ. Look at him.
TV says you gotta
shoot 'em in the head.
TV said a lot of things
that aren't true.
Well, fuck the fucker.
I told him not to go downstairs.
Let's go.
Let's get to work.
Holy shit.
On two. Ready?
One... two!
What are they?
I don't know.
Maybe they're coming for us.
He may as well
be on the Moon.
What's he pointing at?
Helicopter.
Hey, it's coming.
Hey!
Please. What's he doing?
Where's he--
No, no, I mean,
they saw us.
So, I mean, they're gonna
be coming back, baby.
Don't worry.
I mean, they're gonna send
somebody or something.
I don't want anybody
sneakin' around
and stealin' shit.
¿Comprende?
Sweet dreams.
I've just been informed
that we are going off the air...
-
- and switching over to
the Emergency Broadcast System.
You guys know that chick
at Dairy Queen?
The fat one?
Until then, I--John,just a zoom.
I would have tapped
that shit for sure.
Bart, dude,
everybody's dead.
Your brother's dead.
That fat chick at Dairy Queen...
I want to take this opportunity
to say what a pleasure it's been...
dead.
Yeah.
That sucks too.
How do you think
your god will judge you?
When there is
no more room in hell,
the dead will walk the earth.
--
Hey, dumbass.
Hmm?
It's the timers.
It's 8:00.
Terry.
- Go shut 'em off.
- It's Bart's turn.
You're the trainee, man.
Shit rolls downhill.
I wish somebody was working
at Hallowed Grounds.
How hard is it
to make a cup of coffee?
I wanted a soy mocha latte
with foam.
Faggot.
What are you doing?
What's the news?
Bad.
Hey. Hey!
- Hey!
- What?
The bathroom in here is fake.
It doesn't work.
I'll tell C.J.
I'm telling you.
Yeah, I do
all that kind of shit.
So what you think? Hmm?
What is this?
Is this the end of times?
'Cause if it is,
I'm telling you, I'm fucked.
No, I'm serious.
I've done some bad things
in my life, man.
Oh, I get it.
You saw hell yesterday.
Now you're scared
of going to hell...
for all the bad things
you've done.
I'll tell you what.
Go in the stall,
say five Hail Marys.
Wipe your ass
and you and God
can call it even.
You think I feel
like I deserve to be here?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I don't.
And I'm cool with that.
But you see, that's not it.
'Cause I feel like I'm here
for another reason.
I feel like I'm here
to bring that baby
on this earth.
And give it everything
that I never had.
I just want the opportunity...
to change things.
%%
%%
Shit!
C.J.!
How did you get out?
And who gave you permission
to loot the goddamn stores?
- What are we gonna do about that truck?
- We're not going to do anything...
about that truck.
There's people in there.
How do you know
they're not all fucked up
like everybody else out there?
Well, for one thing,
they're driving a truck.
Oh, and shooting guns.
If we start letting people in here,
then we're gonna let the wrong ones in.
And then I'm dead.
You know what?
I don't wanna die.
Who are the wrong ones?
Nobody here is sick.
And I intend
on keeping it that way.
- I just think we should--
- I did not ask for your opinion, lady!
Shut your fuckin' mouth.
- Get the gun outta my face.
-
Tough shit.
Self-defense.
I'm not killin' anybody.
You know what?
I'll kill you.
No, no, stop it, C.J.
Don't do this!
Shut up!
I'll kill each and every one of you
to stay alive. You hear me?
I said get the fucking gun
outta my face!
Oh, you got quite
a mouth on you.
Somebody should show her
how to use it.
Is there a holding cell in there?
Yeah, back of
the security room.
That's real good, man.
You're gonna get us
all killed, dumbass.
Fucking traitor!
Get off me.
Come on.
Wait! Down here!
Hey! Down here!
Can't see a damn thing.
Me either.
Why's he backing up the truck?
Through here!
Hey!
Shit.
Fuck.
We gotta go out there.
Man, you better throw that bullshit
right out your head.
I'm not going back out there.
That's not part of the plan.
Change of plan.
I'm gonna open the door.
No.
Okay.
One, two, three.
No. Don't do it, man.
Come on, man.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
- Get back inside! They're fine!
- Get back inside!
- Here you go.
- There's six more people
inside the truck.
- Andre, look!
-
-
-
Can you help me--
Sir, what's your name? Sorry.
Just gimme a second
to collect myself, okay?
Thanks.
If you wanna just go wait for me in there,
I'll go take a look at your leg.
Here. I'll hold this.
Where do you want her?
We're just going right there.
Oh, my arm.
It's okay, ma'am.
We're gonna make you
nice and comfortable, all right?
The rest of you,
we've got plenty
of food and water.
Help should be along soon.
Help? Did you hear that
from the same jackass
who told us to go to St. Verbena?
The church downtown?
That's the first place I went.
Some dipshit on the radio
said it was safe there.
- He was wrong.
- Is that where you picked him up?
Well, I get this call on the C.B.
from that guy Glen saying
all these folks are in the chapel.
I was in the neighborhood,
so I picked them up.
Well done.
Thanks.
Excuse me.
Wh-When you two fellas
are done blowing each other,
maybe Davy Crockett
can tell us the deal here.
-
- We haven't heard much
since the TVs went out last night.
It's mine.
You mind if I borrow it?
I'm not using it,
Officer.
- Keys.
- They're in the cab.
The truck's not gonna make it
to Fort Pastor.
- How do you know?
- We just came from there.
- Is everyone there dead?
- Or dead-ish.
Is everyone there dead?
Yeah, in the sense
that they all sort of,
- uh, fell down, and then...
- I gotta look for myself.
- You're not gonna make it.
- got up and...
I'll get as far as I can.
That's about
one foot out that door.
- started eating each other.
- I'll take my chances.
Please, there's people here right now
who could use your help.
Fuck y'all.
It's nice to see that
you've all bonded
through this disaster.
Hey. You, uh, need anything?
No, w-we're fine.
Don't worry about us.
He's got a bite on his hand.
She's cold.
That's good, right?
I don't know, it's weird.
I've never seen an infection this bad
that didn't come with a fever.
That guy's arm
looks pretty bad over there.
You should probably check it out.
All right.
Stay with her for a minute.
I'm fine. Really.
Um, they don't hurt much at all.
Tucker could use you more.
-
- Here. I'm just gonna
clean it up a bit.
Ma'am, c-can I
get you something?
Like a glass of water?
Ana! Ana, come here!
Let me see.
Anyone know her name?
Died without a name?
Damn.
Guys, you wanna move
into the other room?
Holy shit!
Holy shit!
Oh, shit.
I think it's the bites.
The bites killed her.
The bites brought her back.
How do you know?
I watched it happen.
I felt her pulse.
She was gone.
Then... yesterday I saw
the same thing happen
to somebody else.
All right.
So who else in the group
is bitten?
Uh, Frank, for sure.
How about the one
with the foot?
Tucker?
He says no, he fell.
So, it's Frank.
Tall guy, right?
Right. So we have to
quarantine him right away.
Where exactly do we do that?
I don't know.
There must be someplace
to keep him in here.
Then what?
I don't know, but--
It's too dangerous
to keep him on here.
I'm sorry.
What are we talking about here?
Are we talking about killing him?
Would you rather
we waited for him to die,
and then he tries to kill us?
Yes. No.
You can't kill him.
Ana.
He's got a daughter!
I'm sorry.
I don't think
there's any other choice.
He's right.
Michael, you can't do this.
What if I'm wrong?
You've seen it happen before.
Frank.
Michael's coming to shoot you.
What are you talking about?
You're infected.
You're gonna become one of them.
You've been bitten.
It's only a matter of time.
No, no, no!
Leave my dad alone! Go away!
Shh!
You have to understand
that she's lost everyone--
her mother,
her two brothers.
I'm all she's got.
Well, Michael,
what are you waiting for?
Go ahead, kill him.
Hey, kill Tucker too.
Wait a minute.
I was never bit.
We can't be sure.
Do it, Michael.
Are you sure it's the bite?
No.
She's sure.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
Hi.
- You okay?
- Mm.
Let me see your arm.
It hurts.
It's already starting to heal.
Andre, I can't have baby here.
Why not? People have been
having babies for millions of years.
All on their own.
No hospitals.
Wait.
Oh, yeah.
It's moving.
I felt it.
So now we gotta come up
with a name for this baby.
I want Russian name.
Don't start that again.
African name.
Please?
Come here.
Gimme a hug.
No.
Terry, come on, man.
Open the door.
Shut up.
You want...
every...
single second.
Ana.
I'm glad you didn't do it.
--
Fuck me harder.
-
-
-
-
Holy shit. He got 'im.
So, who do we have next?
Uh--
Yeah. Burt Reynolds.
Tell him to get Burt Reynolds.
-
- Man, he's good.
Oh, oh. Uh, Rosie O'Donnell.
Tell him to get Rosie.
- Oh, yeah. Rosie.
- Nah, too easy.
Give him something hard.
Hey, sweetheart.
Let me tell you something.
You, uh, you have my permission.
I ever turn into one of those things?
Do me a favor, blow my fucking head off.
Oh, yeah.
You can count on that.
Hey, Andre. How's Luda doing?
She's fine.
Hey, where's that lemon stuff?
It's all gone. Steve likes to
put it in his booze.
-
- Try the vanilla stuff.
All right.
I'd like to drop by
and check on her
and just see how she's doing.
- No, thanks. She's fine.
- You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
It's okay, hon.
We understand.
Before that I worked in
a stationery store.
I drove a snowplow.
Fixed copiers.
God, it's such a shame that
this whole end of the world thing's
holding you back.
-
-
Okay, worse job.
I know which job
I was the worst at.
- Being a husband.
- That's not a job.
It sure is.
You guys just haven't met
the right girl.
Yeah, I tried it three times,
and I got pink slips every time.
What were you best at?
Being a dad.
I think I was best at that.
-
-
-
-
-
Shh. Okay, okay. Shh. Shh.
It's all right, baby.
Shh.
Baby, please.
You gotta be quiet. Okay?
It's gonna be all right.
Our baby's on the way.
It's coming.
That's it.
It's in employee parking,
level three.
They keep 'em in a pen
near the parking shuttles.
Have fun.
Hey. Wait a minute.
You're coming too.
No, I'm not.
I said I'd tell you where
the generators are.
I never said I'd show you.
Did you think I was gonna leave you two
up here? You come with me,
or you go back in that cell.
All right.
I ain't going anywhere
without a gun.
- Have at 'em, cowboy.
- Asshole.
Bart, get the chains.
-
-
- We ready to roll?
- You coming with us?
Nah, you're coming with me.
I've done this before.
Know how to use that?
This one's the dangerous end, right?
-
- Now it is.
This is level one.
We gotta walk down to three.
-
- What the fuck was that?
I just saw something.
You didn't see shit, Bart.
Shut the fuck up.
- Oh, shit. Here it comes.
-
-Jesus Christ!
- It's a fucking dog.
Come here, boy.
At least you know
nothing's down here.
It would've eaten him.
See? Told you I saw something.
Run!
Wait, C.J. Wait up! Wait!
It's locked!
It's fucking locked!
No! No!
C.J.!
I'm out.
C.J.! Matches!
Breathe. You're doing good.
Breathe.
You're doing good, baby.
Breathe.
I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Okay. That's the last.
I'm gonna go check on Luda.
I haven't seen her in a while.
I'll go.
You sure?
- Yeah. Take them some candles.
- Okay. Let me know if
they need anything.
Okay. I'll have
a smoke on the way.
We'll see ya.
Bye.
It's coming.
I see it.
Oh, my God.
It's a girl.
You wanna kill Luda?
You wanna kill my family?
Norma?
Come on, Norma.
What happened?
Son of a bitch shot me.
- Get away from her.
-
Just wait.
She wasn't bitten.
She's gonna wake up though, right?
No.
No. If she was one of them,
she'd be up by now.
Terry.
Hold this.
and given it to a lot of wives
and fathers and kids.
And I told them how sorry I was.
But that's not what
I was really feeling.
In the back of my mind,
I was always saying,
""Better them than me.''
But I don't believe that now.
Because now I realize there are
some things worse than death,
and one of'em
is sitting here waiting to die.
I don't wanna die here.
I saw a couple of buses in the garage.
We could fix 'em up.
We could reinforce them.
- Then get as far from here as possible.
- And then what?
Oh, I have an idea.
Um, while we're at...
why don't we swing by the marina,
hop in my boat and take
it for a pleasure cruise, you jackasses.
- There's not a lot of people of them.
- I was kidding.
- How far is the marina?
- Oh, my God.
- You're serious?
- I think it's a damn good idea.
How about the rest of ya?
Kenneth?
Yeah, it's a good idea.
We have to pick up Andy.
He's part of the group.
Excuse me, uh,
not to shit on anyone's riff,
but let me just see if
I grasp this concept, okay?
You're suggesting
that we take some
fucking parking shuttles...
and reinforce them with
some aluminum siding...
and then just head on over to
the gun store where we watch
our good friend Andy...
play some cowboy-movie,
jump-on-the-covered-wagon bullshit?
Then we're going to drive across
the ruined city through
a welcome committee...
of a few hundred thousand dead cannibals,
all so we can sail off into the sunset
on this fucking asshole's boat?
- Yeah.
- Pretty much, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm in.
We have 1 2 of
these shotgun shells,
hopefully we'll get to the dock
and there won't be too many of them.
Well, it's nice to see you
busting your ass today.
Oh, that's sarcasm.
That is awesome.
Yeah, you know,
I would love to help, but, uh,
a captain never works
alongside his men.
You guys, have a good'un.
What a total dick.
Guys, where'd Chips go?
- Chips?
- Where'd you go, Chips?
-I can't find him.
Chips, come here. Come on, Chips.
-  Come on, Chips.
-
-
There you are. Come on.
There's my boy.
Don't you ever leave me again, okay?
Ever, ever.
Hey. Kenneth wants everyone
upstairs for a meeting.
Come in here first.
I want you to see this.
When those things
are on the side of the bus,
this'll get 'em off.
Cool, huh?
Wow.
That might be the most romantic thing
anyone's ever shown me.
- I'm trying here.
- Yeah, I know.
If we go to pick him up
and he doesn't have his strength,
then we're going to be carrying him.
Tucker, I'm not saying
we don't need him.
There's no point in arguing about this.
We need a solution.
We-We need to get some food over there.
Could you be
a bigger prick?
I think so.
But, you know, that's irrelevant.
My question to you is what's your plan?
Come on.
I got it.
We got to get over there anyway
'cause we need more ammunition.
Shut up!
- I have an idea.
- Stop, it's hurting him.
No! He's not safe.
Nicole, they're not
interested in him. I promise.
Look at me. They want us.
- Chips is gonna be fine.
-
See? Look.
He's walking right by them.
They're not even paying attention to him.

-
- Let me see.
-
Okay. He's there. He's in.
Give me those.
-
- What?
What?
No. Oh, man.
They got him. They got him.
I'll try him on the radio.
Andy. Andy, do you copy?
Andy, can you hear me?
Andy?
Can you hear me? Hello?
- Where are you hurt, Andy?
- Damn, those bastards bite hard.
-
-
- Yeah, it's me, brother.
- Hey, man. Good to hear your voice.
I guess we're going to
meet up close pretty soon, huh?
Oh, shit. Hang on.
Aw,Jesus, he got me good.
Now, you just hang in there.
You got the food, right?
- Yeah.
- Do we tell him?
Hey, this dog got a name?
- See? Listen. It's Nicole?
-
- What the hell's that?
- Oh, my God! It's Nicole!
Shit.
That idiot's going after
the fucking dog.
She made it. She's in.
You guys? I found Chip.
I got him. He's okay.
Nicole, how's Andy looking?
I don't know.
There's a lot of blood in here.
It's everywhere.
There's blood everywhere.
Wait a minute. I see him.
He's on the roof.
He's writing something.
- What's it say?
-
- Tell her to get out.
-
- What's wrong?
- Nicole, baby, how's the truck?
- Tell her to get the hell out now!
- Honey, listen to me. You need to find
a place to hide. Can you do that?
-
- Tell her to get out!
Nicole, listen to me.
I'm in a closet.

-
We need to do something... now.
Tucker, listen.
When we come back through here,
we may have company.
You need to stay here
and make sure that fire door stays open.
Whoa-Whoa.
Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.
Uh, why does he stay here,
while I go on the suicide mission
to rescue Terry's already dead girlfriend?
- Fuck you, man.
- We don't know that.
You know what, asshole? Either way
we gotta get over there and get
the guns and get out of this parking lot.
Michael, it's okay.
Let him stay.
- Steve, don't fuck this up.
- Yeah. Totally.
That's it.
I ain't a plumber,
but I'd say we're pretty much
at the end of the line here.
Through here! Hurry up!
Hurry up!
.3 57, .3 57.
What do you need?
Nicole?
- Andy.
-
I'm sorry, brother.
-
- Go! Get down!
- Shit!
-
-
- I got you, Tucker.
Go! Go!
Go!
Shoot me! Shoot me!
Hurry! Hurry!
Goddamn Steve Markus!
-
- Steve!
- Steve! Fucking kill him!
-
Let's go!
- Go!
-
-
Where are you guys going?
- Let's go right now. We're going.
-
Go! Go!
- They're right behind us!
I like this song.
Everybody in.
Give me the keys.
Prick.
I'll deal with you later, motherfucker!
Wait a minute! Nicole!
Man, get in!
I'll take the gun. Okay.
Okay, let's get out of here.
-
- Hold on!
Oh, Christ!
C.J., now! Go!
They're trying to turn us over!
Hit 'em with the saw!
Come on, damn it.
Holy shit.
Oh, shit.
- There's still one hanging on.
- Which fucking side?
Right side.
-
- You gotta drive faster, man.
Hard left! Hard left! Here!
- Whoa! Stop! Stop, guys!
- What?
We lost 'em.
Back it up. Back it up! Back up!
What the fuck?
- What are you doing?
- Fucking nursery school.
C.J.!
Ana, no. Everyone's dead.
Steve took off.
What?
- Steve!
-
I got him.
- Damn.
-
Watch out!
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Guys, get in!
Let's go.
Where's Ana? Ana!
Ana!
Get in! Get in!
What the hell were you doing?
Hold on!
Go.
Kenneth! Here.
Go to the end of the dock.
-
- Do it, man. I'll catch up!
- There it is.
-
Terry, get the bowline.
Shit.
C.J.!
Jammed! Fuck!
Bitch! Shit!
Come on.
It fucking figures.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
I can't go.
What?
- Downtown when they jumped on us.
- Oh, no, Michael. No.
- I have to stay here.
- Wait. You can't.
- N-Not you. Please.
- I'm sorry, Ana.
I can help you.
You can help them.
I can help you.
It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.
No.
It won't.
Hey.
It will.
- You sure you wanna do this?
- Yeah.
I think I'll just stay here awhile.
Enjoy the sunrise.
--
I run a tight ship.
Where did you get that thing?
Put that down.
Help us.
Get that damn camera
out of my face.
Doesn't look like
there's anyone there.
Terry, put the camera down
while I dock the boat.
-
-
Chips, no!
Stay behind me!
