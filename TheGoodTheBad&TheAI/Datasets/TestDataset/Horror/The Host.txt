Mr. Kim.
I hate dust more than anything.
I'll... I'll clean again.
You don't have to clean up now.
Why don't you dump this first?
That's formalin.
Formaldehyde, to be precise.
To be even more precise, dirty formaldehyde.
Every bottle is coated with layers of dust.
Pour them into the sink.
Excuse me?
Just empty every bottle to the very last drop.
It's just... they are toxic chemicals
and the regulation states that...
Pour them right down the drain, Mr. Kim.
If I pour them in the drain,
they'll run into the Han River.
That's right.
Let's just dump them in the Han River.
But, you know,
this is not just any toxic chemical...
The Han River is very broad, Mr. Kim.
Let's try to be broad-minded about this.
Anyway,
that's an order.
So, start pouring.
What the heck is this?
What?
That's pretty gross.
Is it a mutation?
Is it dead?
No, it moved a second ago.
Yeah? Wait...
My cup!
That was close.
My daughter gave me this cup.
Look, it's swimming away.
How many tails does that thing have?
You got me.
Makes your skin crawl.
- Mr. Yoon!
- Sir! October 2006, Han River Bridge
What the hell are you doing?
Don't do it!
No! No!
Did you guys see that?
Underneath...
In the water!
Something dark
in the water...
You really didn't see it?
What the hell are you talking about?
Morons, to the very end.
Have a good life.

Daddy!
Hyun-seo? Hyun-seo...
Wait for me!
Now that you're awake...
Three squids for mat #4,
roast them quickly.
Gosh, how much sleep
can a body take?
Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo!
Here you are.
Oh, that hurts.
Did your uncle do a good job?
He came, at least.
I was worried.
I was the only one whose
uncle came to parents' day.
That's why I kept calling,
but you didn't answer.
Why didn't you answer?
You think this phone
can receive signals?
I'm too embarrassed
to use it in public. You take it.
What's wrong with it?
Oh, and about uncle...
I could smell alcohol on him
when he stood in the back of class.
That punk,
getting drunk at this hour.
Hasn't it started, Grandpa?
What?
Today's Nam-joo's competition,
aren't we gonna watch?
Oh, Nam-joo! Right...
Why isn't it on?
- You know what this is?
- What?
I'm saving up
to get you a new phone.
There's a lot, huh?
They're all dimes!
That'll never be enough.
There are some quarters, too...
What's this penny doing here?
This is all from the change box, huh?
I'll tell Grandpa.
- Go ahead, tell the geezer.
- Geezer?
It's a dead body.
Today morning,Han river in Seoul
That's gross.
Today morning,Han river in Seoul Why
aren't they showing the game anyway?
Today morning,Han river in Seoul
Turn to 505. The sports channel.
Oh, there it is!
I made that for her.
Aunt!
A bullseye every time!
- Park Nam-joo!
- Grandpa!
The old man has to run the shop,
let's watch it ourselves.
What do you mean?
We all need to support her.
Grandpa!
Let the geezer roast some squid.
A straw...
Let's have a cold one.
Here.
This is alcohol!
You're in middle school now.
- What? Are you really my father?
- When your daddy was in middle...
Alright! The semi-finals!
Wow. She looks tough.
It's bitter!
Go, Park Nam-joo!
Who else could take so long to take a shot?
Park Nam-joo, Kyungki, Suowon city hall
- Oh, it started.
- Nam-joo is on. You gonna watch?
Gold medal time!
I can't watch my daughter's matches,
I get too nervous.
Gold medal this time!
Gang-du.
- Yeah?
- Come outside.
- I have to watch this.
- Come on out.
Now!
I received a complaint from mat #4.
Their squid had only nine legs.
Did you eat one?
No...
Don't deny it!
Why touch other people's things?
Think of it from the customer's
perspective. A squid...
The torso tastes delicious,
but the legs.
especially the longest one,
has got something special, right?
From a paying customer's
perspective, it's important.
Take this to mat #4.
Tell them it's on the house.
Mat #4,
- I've brought your order.
- Oh, put it down there.
What are you looking at?
There's something there.
Come on.
- There, under the bridge.
- See it?
- Do you see it?
- How long has it been there?
- It's been a while.
- I told you.
Ah, it's construction equipment.
- Something they hung...?
- No.
Don't think so.
It's moving.
Yeah, it just moved.
Did it?
Bullseye!
She's amazing!
I'm not just saying that
because she's my daughter.
How could she hit
the exact center like that?
Right!
I can't believe it!
Let's close the stand today.
It's going in.
It's huge
God, it's huge
Did you see that?
He ate the can!
- Maybe, it's dolphine.
- All in one gulp.
Have some beer nuts too!
It swam off.
It's gone now.
It's an amazonian river dolphin
for sure.
This time there are ten legs.
Mister.
This time there are ten legs.
Count them yourself.
Run away! Everyone run away!
In Kyung-boo high way has
little bit of traffic jam,
the traffic is going slow
from Soowon to Dongjak bridge,
Open up!
Young-ho!
My son must be in there.
Someone help, please!
There are people in there.
I gotta go help.
Hey, mister, my kid...
Donald, don't go.
Come on, Donald. Come back!
You're gonna get hurt. Donald!
Hey, hey, hey!
Let me help! Let me help!
Hey, man! Hey, man!
You're not gonna get this door open.
Hey!
Donald! Where're you going?
Donald! Come Back!
Faster! Let's go!
Throw it hard!
Donald!
- Semi-finals...
- Shoot!
Ooh, now is not the time to
lower her bow.
Shoot!
Shoot!
You could have just let go.
Park's Achilles'heel
is taking too long to release.
She shouldn't have done that.
She wasted much time.
At this point, Park can only hope Yoon Ock-hee, Kyungbook
Yecheon county office advanced to the final of individual woman
Hyun-seo!
- Hyun-seo!
- Hey, come back!
Gang-du!
- Hyun-seo!
- Hold anything!
Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo!
Sir!
Sir!
You have ten minutes to clear the area!
Please take care of your things
and evacuate.
Come on.
Nam-joo.
Hyun-seo!
It's bronze. Bronze.
Your aunt
brought you a bronze medal.
Hyun-seo, it's your aunt...
Hyun-seo...
Hyun-seo...
Hyun-seo, your uncle came.
Thanks to you, we're all together...
Hyun-seo!
Let go of me!
What are you taking pictures of?
What's so goddamn interesting?
Fuck off!
Stop taking pictures!
Calling the owner of a Hyundai car,
plate # 2487!
Hey lady, how could
you park your car there?
So you screwed up?
I heard everything.
You grabbed some other girl's hand?
You left Hyun-seo on the ground?
Your own daughter!
You call yourself a fucking father?
You son of a bitch!
I thought it was Hyun-seo's hand...
She's so pretty in that photo.
She looks just like her mom
in that photo.
Do you think her mom
even knows that she died?
Not a chance.
It's been 13 years since she
popped out the baby and ran off.
I'd run away too, dammit.
Are you sleeping? Huh?
Nam-il...
You can sleep at a time like this?
What are you doing to your brother?
Her birth was an accident...
and so was her death...
Old people have always said,
that an animal which kills a human
should be torn limb from limb.
That it's a human's duty to do so.
Until I slit that beast's stomach and
at least find Hyun-seo's body,
I'll never
leave this world in peace.
Attention please!
Ladies and gentlemen, those of you
present at the river incident...
there are probably a lot of you here...
This is an important matter of
life and death.
Those who were at the scene...
or those who have come
in contact with these people!
Raise your hands!
This isn't something
you should hide.
Raise your hands.
If you go home, it might affect
your families. Raise 'em high!
Hey, mister.
What the hell is going on here?
Fuck, shouldn't you start by
explaining what's happening?
- Yeah
- Explain!
An explanation should
be appearing on the TV news now.
To save time, we'll let the news
serve as explanation.
Okay, the news... the news...
- Take off that shit and speak!
- ... isn't on now.
Shit...
Anyway, from this moment.
you fall under our control,
so start moving!
This is for your own safety.
We have transport buses
waiting outside now.
Okay, please move toward
the buses in an orderly fashion.
That's right. Watch your children.
Oh, did anyone here touch or come
into direct contact with the creature?
Um... I didn't touch it.
But some of its blood
got sprayed in my face.
Don't move! Tell him to freeze!
Grab him! Grab that one!
Please remain calm, people.
What are you doing? My son
didn't touch anything!
Let go!
Why are you doing this?
- Gang-du! Get out of there!
- Dad!
- Don't go!
- Dad!
Gang-du, don't worry.
I'm coming with you.
Stop that!
Hey, number 31! Stop!
It now appears that the creature,
which disappeared after its attack,
on surprised parkgoers today, is far more
dangerous than previously assumed.
U.S. Army Sgt. Donald White,
who fought bravely with the creature,
is now undergoing treatment
at a U.S. Army hospital.
After a thorough examination,
U.S. Army medical staff have identified,
an unknown virus,
primarily in body parts,
that came into contact
with the creature.
I can't give any of that inform ation
without the approval of the United States.
The U.S. Army has shipped a sample
of the virus to the U.S.
which confirmed that
the creature from the Han River,
as with the Chinese civet wild cat
and SARS,
All military units sent to pursue
and capture the creature,
have been recalled
due to the risk of infection.
Only special forces
trained in biological warfare,
and disinfectant units are
allowed access to the Han River area.
Damn,
they made a fuss dragging us in here!
What is this shit?
Where are all the guys in yellow?
Look!
The doctors aren't
even wearing masks.
Hello, sir!
When might we
be allowed to go home?
- You can't go home.
- What? We can't?
Dad, am I dying?
Don't say that!
Just do what the doctors tell you.
But Dad, my back feels itchy and weird.
Like something's moving.
Ah, shit...
It's a squirmy feeling,
like something's there.
It's because
you never take a bath, it's okay.
Attention! Numbers 25-40,
raise your hands. Quickly!
This group, move to room 904 now.
Not again!
Don't tell anyone
about the blood on your face, okay?
- Mr. Park Gang-du?
- Yes?
You need to take a lot of tests,
so don't eat until tomorrow morning.
What? Don't eat anything?
Don't feed him anything!
No food!
Hello?
Hello?
Dad, can you hear me?
Please answer me!
Is this Hyun-seo?
Dad, listen to me!
I can't get out!
You're alive? Where...?
It's like a big sewer.
Really big and deep.
Where?
Hello?
Hyun-seo...
- Come quick!
- Hyun-seo
Is it Hyun-seo?
What is it?
Did you see that?
- What?
- Wait a minute.
Sweet!
Hey!
Hey, don't go near the water.
Be careful!
Let's go.
I'm starving.
It's okay, get back in.
Mister! Mister!
Try to turn...
Your daughter, Park Hyun-seo,
a seventh grader at Dangsan Middle School.
She's on the deceased list.
Yes, she goes to Dangsan School...
she's deceased,
but she's not dead.
I mean, she died, but she's still alive.
Now you're talking in circles.
So, she's on the list..
Wait, shut up.
- At any rate, there was a call.
- Right.
So shouldn't you be able to
trace the call or something?
Trace the call?
That's not something
we do for just anyone.
Are you even aware
of how complicated that is?
'Just anyone' is that what you said?
Stop it! Step back!
What the...
Please, officer,
let's talk like reasonable people.
- They're just kids, don't...
- What are you doing?
No, I mean...
Your daughter never called you
in the first place, okay?
Your son had a dream,
but it was so real that...
You don't believe
anything we said?
Now you're obstructing an officer
in the line of duty...
Step back, Nam-joo.
Officer, should I explain it again?
The way it happened was...
I know, I know.
You yourself saw your daughter die.
But she called you
in the middle of the night?
Does that make any sense?
That's completely ridiculous!
A servant of the people,
talking back like that?
- Then what's your problem?
- Just a moment...
Stop!
This is...
This is my daughter Park Hyun-seo.
My daughter...
I'm the creature.
I ate her... Okay?
And then...
It happened like this.
This is the sewer.
You don't understand?
He's received
psychological treatment?
He's not a bad man, but he's
in shock. We should understand.
- Hey.
- I knew it!
Officer!
My daughter is alive in the sewer!
- Officer?
- Cut it out!
Your putting on
a damn show doesn't help!
My friend's nephew's husband's
brother-in-law is a cop,
maybe we should contact him...?
Right, I'm sure he'd
bend over backwards for us.
You're a college graduate,
can't you even persuade a cop?
What's college got to do with it?
I put you through school
selling cup ramen, and you...
- Dad.
- Huh?
How long's it been since
she's eaten? Down in the sewer?
What's there to eat down there?
You over there!
Hey blondie, stop!
Run!
Out of the way!
Catch them!
Out of the way! Quick!
This way! Hurry up!
Gang-du, hurry up!
- Which floor?
- Close the door! Quick!
I'm coming down, but I'm
in the elevator, so...
Where is he?
B4 A3?
What did I just say?
B4 A3!
A3. Where's A3?
There it is!
Stop! Catch that car.
Hurry! Open the door!
Go! Step on it!
- Nam-joo!
- Hurry up!
Where is Nam-joo?
Where is she?
Did they catch her?
- Oh, shit.
- Where?
Where?
- There, there!
- Where?
Over there.
That idiot!
How could you leave
your only sister?
- We can pick her up!
- Pick her up then!
- She's always been slow...
- Mister, can you stop here?
Hurry up!
What a dimwit!
- Hurry it up, will you?
- Quick! Quick!
Hey, family!
Everyone stop. Stop the van.
Hey, stop!
Just close it! Close!
Did we make it?
That does it.
This won't do.
The basic fee for pickup and the
items you ordered is 7,400 dollars.
Including the Han River sewer map.
Plus, we brushed off
a cop in the parking lot,
and two police cars on the road.
Anyway, including hazard fees,
the total is 11,400 dollars.
One of the escaping family...
Wow, Gang-du on TV!
That's my citizen ID photo.
It's from one of those
subway photo booths?
Hey, we should tape this and
show it to Hyun-seo. Daddy on TV...
Jesus...
We don't accept these. If you're
short on cash, we accept cards.
We'll just take the card.
The blonde one,
who made direct contact with it.
That bitch!
Listen to the mouth on her.
He pounced on me
and slammed me to the floor.
I think he gave me arthritis.
I'll need treatment, I'm sure.
I know who she is.
Like we can't recognize her
through that voice disguiser?
But they keep reporting on us.
The superior archer who escaped In addition,
the daughter among the escaped family members
The superior archer who escaped is confinirmed to
be Park Nam-joo, national bronze medalist in archery.
What the hell?
How come there's nothing about me?
There's nothing special about you.
Plenty of unemployed
university grads these days...
I sacrificed my youth for
the democratization of our country,
and those fuckers
won't even give me a job.
The passwords are all 4989?
There's a white truck outside.
It's a disinfection truck,
you can take it.
expressed concern that Korea is
not adequately quarantining,
- the infected. The U.S. also...
- Come on, let's go.
That's the truck?
Does it really work?
This is what you got
after spending all your assets?
This gun is...
Fuck, we're not boy scouts.
And why only two disinfectant suits?
So two of us should just
creep around hiding?
Dad, shouldn't this be yellow?
If it's not yellow,
they're bound to catch us.
Wow, this map is
the topping on the cake.
The red circles indicate sewers?
You spent 500 dollars on this?
Really?
But... I got it from a civil servant
who knows the sewer system.
It's photocopied
on the back of used paper.
Hey, a guard post. Get down!
Cover up, quickly!
Your blonde hair is showing.
Get down quickly!
Whatever, you two handle it.
What? If that's their attitude,
why even bother?
Bunch of lazy bums.
Quiet! Stop.
Mr. Park?
Mr. Bacteria?
Lower your mask.
This definitely
a Daesung disinfectant truck.
But are you Daesung people?
Yes, but we're a different team.
Oh, really?
I'm Manager Cho
from the district office.
Don't you know who I am?
You know that 14 different companies
are doing the fumigation on shifts?
But Daesung just
barged in at the end.
To the other companies,
it seems odd.
So I spoke with
President Kwak yesterday...
Not this! No!
Let go...
Manager Cho, this is all I have
with me right now.
Sorry, I'll see you later.
Hey, Gang-du.
Hyun-seo.
It's your Dad.
Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo!
Park Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo!
Why does he have to do that?
He's not a kid.
Let him be.
He wants to disinfect himself.
He's worried he'll
pass the virus on to Hyun-seo.
Virus...
All of us are fine, why do they
keep going on about a fucking virus?
If the government says so,
we have to accept it. What can we do?
Is it the virus
that's making me so sleepy?
Hyun-seo...
Look on the ground for footprints.
Hey, did Hyun-seo describe any
special traits of the sewer?
Special traits?
We need some kind of hint here.
Hyun-seo said it was a big sewer.
Look how big this is.
Yes, it seems we'll find something.
Yeah, sure!
Wandering blindly through the sewers...
We need to think of a better way.
Stop complaining! Put your time into
searching another sewer instead.
Hey tortoise! Just try to keep up.
Slow-ass bronze medalist.
- You wanna die?
- Wait!
Hyun-seo! Hyun-seo!
Turn it off.
Something moved there.
Move!
It's this way!
Get down!
What is this?
It's just water!
God damn it!
How typical of you.
Sorry, Dad.
Did you pee?
Because of the bangs, a little.
Why are they going around shooting?
Wow, this cave really does lead
to the Han River!
It's not a cave, it's a sewer.
They're all connected like this.
Gosh, it's hard to make a living.
Do we really have to go?
So you're not hungry?
No, I'm hungry!
If we do this once,
we'll eat well for a whole month.
- Don't you know that?
- I do.
Wow, there's money too.
Don't touch it.
Why not? I'm taking it.
If we take that too, it's theft.
Put it back now, okay?
We're stealing from this place anyway.
Se-joo, this is not theft.
We're now doing 'seo-ri'.
Like melon seo-ri at a farm.
Hey, do you even know
what seo-ri means?
No? The generation gap
is pretty big.
It's an old borrowing game kids play.
So, seo-ri is a right of the hungry.
Run!
