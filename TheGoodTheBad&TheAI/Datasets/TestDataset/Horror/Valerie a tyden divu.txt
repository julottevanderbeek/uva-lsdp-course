Valerie and Her Week of Wonders
Translated by mrickx, Awe and KH
Who's there?
Polecat!
"Valerie, forgive me."
Where are her earrings ?
Speak!
I lost them, constable.
- You lie, Orlik.
- No, I don't.
You can't avoid punishment,
I will torture you with water.
Orlik!
Bend down!
I will jump on your back.
Hurry up!
Scallywag.
Grandmom, have the actors arrived ?
You should be more concerned that
the missionaries are coming.
When?
Today or tomorrow.
One of them will be living with us.
You are not playing with that earring, are you ?
I'm not a child anymore, grandmom.
Just tonight, you know.
At 13 ... as your mother.
I'm warning you!
Get rid of that ear-rings.
Your mother put them away on the day
when she entered the nunnery.
Your father was a bishop.
As you know, both are now in heaven.
Is there some secret in these earrings?
Oh no.
I got them at this house's auction from some constable.
Did you know him?
Grandmom, the actors have arrived.
But it's just a weding.
Hedvika is marrying.
Poor Hedvika.
Why?
She will be a rich farmer's wife.
Grandmom!
Grandmom, monster!
This can't be him.
He'd died already.
Who are you talking about, grandmom?
Go and repeat your piano fingering.
O.K. grandmom.
"Beautiful maiden.
It was me who stole your earrings and
brought them back in your hands again.
My uncle, the constable, desires them.
He killed my dad and mom and I'm afraid for your destiny.
Today will be in church...
...today will be in church sermon for maidens.
Please leave your dress in summer-house so that
in disguise I could exchange a few words with you.
Your unhappy Orlik."
Valerie?
Valerie?
Where are you my child?
Valerie?!
Valerie?
It's time to dress for vesper.
Grandmom, may I take with me a leaf of rosemary?
Me, God's servant, missionary.
I came between you, maidens,
to give you the knowledge and God's vow.
Oh maiden, do you know what you are?
You are an alabaster handshake.
You are an uncut pomegranate.
You are the boat of a leaf and an opening rosebud.
Rough hand touching your breast would
leave an indelible fingerprint.
But I'm with you, my maiden.
In guardian angel's place I bow to you.
And I bless with this wine, your mouth, your breast, your lap.
Amen.
Amen.
Orlik?
Orlik?
Orlik?
Orlik!
Orlik?
Valerie, is that you?
The monster tortured me hard.
Valerie, I want to give you advice.
- We are on square.
- I'm sorry.
Don't look.
Yet?
Yet!
I'm here.
Firstly :
Where is the public poor-house, dear child?
There, reverend sir.
You do act from mercy?
Or don't you like me?
No reverend sir.
Dear me! I please you.
You enter first.
Go on, don't worry.
Please.
This is my kingdom.
Valerie!
Come!
Closer.
Come closer.
Look.
Oh no!
I know that I don't appeal to you anymore, my Gracian.
Only five years ago, when you were here last time...
...but now!
Go away!
I will lash myself.
- Grandmom!
- Look!
It's only a dream.
I'm asleep and everything is a dream.
Did he hurt you ?
No.
He wants you to love him.
How could I love him when I am affraid of him?
That's just it.
Orlik?
Orlik!?
I'm waiting for you, constable.
Damned broker.
Hands up, burglar, or I will shoot!
Elsa, it's me.
Don't you remember me?
Richard.
I haven't heard my name for ages.
Why did you come Richard?
I missed you so much.
I had never loved another man from that time you seduced me and left.
I'm really sorry about that.
See how old you are, Elsa!
Then you were 17.
What would I give to become younger like you.
Richard, tell me your secret.
I will give you everyting you want.
Give me back this house, Elsa!
This means to rob Valerie!?
You are capable of much worse deeds!
Yes, I will.
Well, let's write a small business agreement.
You will be young and beautiful again.
It will happen tonight, on the stingy farmer's wedding night.
You are devil!
This pearl will save you.
Orlik, where is Valerie?
- I kidnapped her.
- Where?
To the church tower.
- Au!
- Come to me, ninny! You will take me there.
Pray.
Do you hear?
For the third time bells had tolled and went quiet again.
The food is excelent.
One enjoys any meal, especially after things
I've seen when I was with the cannibals.
There we saved a young black girl.
- She was very beautiful.
- What happened to her, reverend?
We took her to our tent and
tried to convert her to our faith.
She showed a great talent.
And did she become really a nun?
Unfortunately no.
- We lost her in a certain french port.
- Martha, where is wine?
One day I will tell you what happened to her.
She fell into bad indecency and
committed a sin against 6th commandment.
- I will give you advice in that respect, dear child.
- Thank you, reverend.
Your father bishop was a gentleman.
He fainted during bride's confession and
all the beautiful women adored him.
I will tell you more sometime.
And how many children did he have?
You and a boy called Orlik.
Orlik!?
What happened?
I've got a headache. May I go and lie down?
Dinner is still not over.
Excuse me.
Will you touch the glasses with us?
I have never drunk wine.
Make an exception today.
In a memory of dead bishop.
Orlik?
Orlik?
I want to talk to you my child.
Now reverend?
There is no better time for contemplation.
How beautiful breasts you have.
Go away reverend.
What I want from you is sweet.
You are so beautiful!
- You are so gorgeous!
- Go away.
You are so fascinating!
I will resist you, you coward.
You will responsible for my death.
What have you done?
Signed.
My house is again yours.
And now we will wait till midnight.
At the wedding bed.
Come, it's time.
Pity of my hopes.
Come, it's time.
I'm so old.
I will be too.
- Do you love me?
- Yes.
Not one drop of blood.
Don't cry.
You look old when you cry.
Valerie?
Valerie?
Orlik!
Orlik.
Valerie!
Please.
- Don't look that way.
- What way?
Kneel down!
Kneel down!
- Isn't it too cold?
- No.
I'm like blindman.
There is a free guest room in our house.
You will relax there.
He knocked me down from the tower, toad.
The bell clapper saved me.
I heard the strange toll.
I prayed for you.
Plague is our best friend.
If my uncle don't get enough fresh blood.
- He will die of a terrible death.
- You are cruel
He is 100 years overdue for death.
The monster.
It's nothing, just a hanged man.
Where are we?
Still under your house.
I'm afraid.
Be brave!
Who is in these coffins?
Victims from which the polecat sucked blood.
Look here.
Grandmom!
Valerie!
Excuse me, I was't suitably dressed.
This is your room.
I thought that the room was free.
I came on the night coach.
Do you recognize me, don't you?
I'm your remote cousin.
Call me Elsa.
Valerie.
And this is...
...this is my brother.
Orlik.
I have settled in your room as you can see.
I give it up.
No, no, you will give me another one.
I will talk to grandmother about it.
Your grandmother had left, dear child.
Without farewell?
Old people have strange habits.
- I hope you will allow me to take her room.
- With pleasure.
This room is yours.
Please.
- I'd love to ride a horse.
- I'll lend you mine.
I am very tired, I will go to bed.
- Don't you recognize me, Valerie?
- No.
You are not afraid of me, are you?
I'm just joking, my dear.
We really meet for first time.
My earrings.
Your sister hasn't returned?
Where is Valerie? Do you know?
- You are sweet when you are angry.
- Where is Valerie!?
I will tell you on one condition...
...that you will love me.
Never!
Go away sir.
No.
I'm not your guest. You go!
You will regret that!
You will have glorious death.
Die as maiden! Die!
Orlik!? Orlik!? Orlik!?
Good night my dark haired girl, good night and sweet dreams.
When you wake up don't reveal the secret.
Valerie you are saved.
I heard everything.
My cousin loves you.
- Cousin?
- I know.
It's grandmom.
She stole my earrings.
But empty.
There is their mystery.
They will save you from danger of death.
Beware of polecat!
Where is he?
He's dying.
Wretch.
You were sold on his charm.
Valerie.
I love you.
You can't!
- We are brother and sister.
- But...
- We have the same father.
- ...that's not not true.
Valerie, come back.
Valerie, my father is polecat!
Yea and nay, yea and nay, yea!
I'm dying.
I'm dying.
Now you can see what old age means.
Valerie? Valerie?
You are wasting your time.
Valerie's dying.
I sacrificed her for my youth.
You are as lost as I'm.
You will fall into the same spasms.
Only your granddaughter could save us both.
She has my blood.
How is that?
Her father was not the bishop?
I was bishop!
I'm her father.
You lie.
Drink!
- Drink!
- No!
- First tell me how to extend my youth.
- Save Valerie!
Our salvation is in her blood.
Valerie.
Damned Valerie.
It's me.
Father!
My child!
Take this.
No i detest.
I'm a human again and I have to die.
No, you won't die.
You saved me.
Dad.
- Let me go! I please you.
- I'm again the monster.
Let me go!
Leave me alone!
No! No! No!
Gracian!
My Gracian!
Gracian!
Your lover sleeps like a log.
Gracian.
Poor Gracian.
I have a certain plan, Elsa.
I need Orlik's heart.
Do you want to kill Orlik?
His heart will reanimate my daughter
and give her eternal youth.
Richard, transplant Orlik's heart into my chest.
Are you going to betray Valerie?
Richard, you will do it.
With bleeding heart.
Orlik?
Orlik?
Why did i leave you.
Help!
Help!
Why do you show your face to me, Valerie?
Don't worry, I'm not dead and you are neither.
Come on, I will show you the way out.
Parsonage is on the opposite side, reverend.
Reprobate, you tempted me to commint a sin.
You will see!
"Valerie.
Valerie.
I'm saying good bye.
You have left me and the monster had disgraced your mouth.
We could have been so happy together but it's too late now.
Believe Valerie.
Polecat is not your and mine Father.
You extened his life.
I wanted be your guardian, friend and husband but it's too late.
Farewell Valerie, your Orlik.
Valerie?
Valerie, what happend to you?
Come.
Hedvika.
Hedvika?
Hedvika, what happend to you? Hedvika?
I'm fading from wedding.
- Eat strong soups.
- No.
No. No. No.
I'm under the spell of a vampire.
Valerie?
See my shoulder.
Does it hurt?
Oh no. No.
Do you see anything on my lips?
- No, why?
- Are not they stained?
You ate fruits, didn't you?
I'm not afraid of anything when you are with me.
I'm so happy.
I have never had a real friend.
Valerie?
Valerie, I'm saved!
- Hedvika.
- See!
The stain is gone.
- Your kisses gave me back my health.
- You are so beautiful.
There lives a witch among you!
She tortured me with sinful words.
She rubbed her slick hips against me.
Whe she found that I could resist her seducements.
She threw a noose round my neck.
I thank God that I'd escaped with my life.
But the witch is hidden among you.
In name of God give her in!
- She deserves to be burned to death.
- That's lie! Don't believe him.
It's her! The witch!
Don't believe him! He is lying, I swear.
Apage satanas!
Catch her! On the pyre with her!
Plead guilty! You are a witch!
Lier, firer.
Expiate.
Moustached comedian.
Orlik.
Why have you forsaken me?
Come here, bitches!
Have you ever been beaten?
Beast!
Drink deep!
Richard.
Disappeared!
Polecat!!!!
I wish all the spells went away.
Grandmom.
When did you come back?
Where from, my child, I was in church.
Have the missionaries gone yet?
Which missionaries?
What happend to you child?
Nothing, grandmom.
Grandmom?
There is an unknown boy.
It's only a actor,
who wander around the town.
"My dear.
Don't go to the theater.
Let
right away
harness the horses
and go to the blue lake.
Don't shoot for god's sake!
Miss!
Miss, your grandmom is dying!
Grandmom!
Dear grandmom, how do you feel?
Grandmom.
Grandmom.
Mirror.
Coach without a driver went out from court.
This is a good sign.
I never had a courage to tell you the truth.
Your mother loved certain young hunter.
And gave birth to his two children.
Boy and girl.
But, Richard, my lover told me that those children were his.
And I, from jealousy,
drove out your mother from the house.
I kept the girl.
That's you.
Orlik was kidnapped by Richard
and ended up in an unknown place.
I drove out your mother with these words.
"I will only take you in
when the horses bring you back."
My mother is still alive?
Grandmom!
Mom!
My child!
This is your father, my dear.
I know your face from somewhere, father.
You probably remember it from babyhood.
Is this all real, it's not a dream?
I wish your grandmother had forgiven me.
