'Previously on "Hannibal"...'
I want you to help me, Dr Lecter.
You've read about it.
'This is a very shy boy.
I would love to meet him.'
I'm Francis Dolarhyde.
Miss McClane,
can I give you a ride home?
'Have you considered
that he may believe he is disfigured?'
May I touch your face? I just want
to know if you're smiling or frowning.
- I'm smiling.
- 'Hello, Dr Lecter.'
'What are you becoming?'
'The Great Red Dragon.'
Buh...
Buh... Buh...
Buh...
Buh... Buh...
Ruh...
Reh... Reh...
Buh... Reh...
Meh... Keh...
'Baltimore State Hospital.'
Hello. My name is Byron Metcalf.
I'm Hannibal Lecter's lawyer.
- 'One moment please.'
- I'll hold.
'Hello?'
Hello... Dr Lecter.
As an avid fan,
I wanted to tell you that I'm delighted
that you have taken an interest in me.
I don't believe
you would tell them who I am,
even if you knew.
'What particular body
you currently occupy is trivial.'
I knew that you alone
would understand this.
The important thing is
what I am becoming.
'Tell me.
What are you becoming?'
The Great... Red...
Dragon.
I've admired you for years.
And I have a complete collection
of your press notices.
Actually,
I think of them as unfair reviews.
As unfair as yours?
They like to sling
demeaning nicknames, don't they?
Tooth Fairy.
What could be more inappropriate?
It would shame me
for you to see that,
if I didn't know that you have suffered
the same distortions in the press.
You've read Freddie Lounds' latest?
It's not a good picture of you.
Your speech is bent
and pruned by disabilities,
real and imagined, but...
your words are startling.
I want to be recognised by you.
As John the Baptist recognised
the one who came after.
I want to sit before you
as the Dragon sat
before 666 in Revelation.
I have...
things I would love to show you.
Someday, if circumstances permit,
I would like to meet you
and watch you... meld
with the strength of the Dragon.
See how magnificent you are.
"Did he who made the Lamb
make thee?"
I awoke in the fresh-smelling semi-dark,
knowing in some primal way
that I was near the sea.
Day and evening again,
the smell of fresh flowers
and the vague awareness
of a needle bleeding into me.
He never called me my name.
That was strange at first.
And then it wasn't strange.
And then...
my name was Lydia Fell.
Deeply felt truths about myself
as Bedelia Du Maurier
were smoke and mirrors
of the highest order.
What we take for granted
about our sense of self,
everything we see,
everything we remember,
is nothing more
than a construct of the mind.
Dante was the first to conceive of Hell
as a planned space,
an urban environment.
Before Dante, we spoke not
of the "gates" of Hell
but of the "mouth" of Hell.
My journey to damnation began
when I was swallowed by the beast.
Thank you.
Poor Doctor Du Maurier,
swallowed whole,
suffering inside Hannibal Lecter's bowels
for what must have felt like an eternity.
You didn't lose yourself.
You just crawled so far up his ass,
you couldn't be bothered.
Hello, Will.
You hitched your star to a man
commonly known as a monster.
You're the Bride of Frankenstein.
We've both been his bride.
How did you manage
to walk away unscarred, huh?
I'm covered in scars.
I wasn't myself.
You were.
Even when you weren't, you were.
- I wasn't wearing adequate armour.
- No.
You were naked.
Have you been to see him?
Yes.
You haven't learned your lesson,
have you?
Or did you just miss him that much?
Have you been to see him?
I've seen enough of him.
I was with him behind the veil.
You were always on the other side.
Something we should talk about.
You'll have to make an appointment.
We're at the zoo.
Why are we at the zoo?
It's cold for the zoo.
Did you ever see a tiger?
No.
They're working on its tooth
and they have to put him to sleep.
If you want, you can touch him.
You wanna do it?
It's in here.
How do I know he's sound asleep?
Tickle him.
Do you have
a general impression?
I can describe as much as you like.
Put your left hand
on the edge of the table.
You can explore with your right.
Take your time.
D?
I'd like you to tell me what you see,
if you don't mind.
He's striking.
Orange and black stripes.
The orange is so bright,
it's almost bleeding
into the air around him.
It's radiant.
I'm right here with you.
That was a very elegant gesture.
Eloquent, too.
Maybe the most eloquent thing
I ever heard of.
That tiger, this house...
You're full of surprises, D.
I don't think anyone at Gateway
knows you at all.
- Did you ask them?
- No.
Then how do you know
nobody knows me?
Because they wonder about you.
They wonder about everything.
They find you very mysterious.
Did they tell you how I look?
I didn't ask them.
But, yes, they told me.
Do you want to hear it?
Don't ask if you don't.
I think I'll tell you.
They said you have
a kind of hard, clean...
...neatness that they like.
They say you're very sensitive
about your face,
and that you shouldn't be.
Where the hell are you?
Ah.
Here you are.
Do you want to know
what I think?
I hope I didn't shock you.
That's so sweet.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I really had a terrific time, D.
Good.
Me too.
But I need to go home now.
Yes.
Good.
I'll take you now.
Go behind your work table.
If you approach the barrier
before you hear the lock snap,
I'll mace you in the face,
understand?
Yes, indeed.
Thank you so much, Denise.
- 'Are you ready for your call?'
- Yes, please.
'You've reached
the offices of Byron...
'Operator.'
Operator, I don't have
the use of my hands.
Could you please ring
- 'Of course. Have a nice day.'
- Thank you.
- 'Dr Frederick Chilton's office.'
- Is this Linda?
'Linda doesn't come in on weekends.'
Maybe you could help me,
if you don't mind.
This is Bob Greer
at Blaine & Edwards Publishing.
Dr Chilton asked me
to send his book to someone
and Linda was supposed to give me
the address but she never did.
'She'll be in on Monday.'
I have to catch Federal Express
in about five minutes
and I don't want
to bother Frederick at home.
It's right there in his contacts.
I'll dance at your wedding,
if you'll read it to me.
'I'm opening the file.'
Be a darling and slide the cursor
down to the letter G.
Give it a click
and I'll be out of your hair.
'All right.
What was the name?'
Graham.
Will Graham.
'Have you had
any contact with him?'
'He sends me greeting cards
on Christian holidays and my birthday.
'He always includes a recipe.'
If he does end up eating you, Bedelia,
you'd have it coming.
I can't blame him for doing
what evolution has equipped him to do.
If we just do whatever
evolution equipped us to do,
murder and cannibalism
are morally acceptable.
They are acceptable,
to murderers and cannibals.
And you.
And you.
You lied, Bedelia.
You do that a lot.
Why do you do that a lot?
I obfuscate.
Hannibal was never not my patient.
Covert treatment suffers secrecy
and disapproval.
Covert because Hannibal was
an uncooperative patient?
Covert because I was
a cooperative psychiatrist.
"Do no harm."
And did you?
I did.
Technically.
You dared to care.
Not the first time
I've lost professional objectivity
in a matter where Hannibal is concerned.
What did he tell you?
What do you think he told me?
I think he told you that I'm paranoid.
- Are you?
- Yes.
But that's not to suggest
I don't have good reason to be.
You don't trust Dr Lecter?
There's something wrong
with Dr Lecter.
Did you think that way before he ended
the doctor-patient relationship?
It's why he ended it.
He knew I knew.
I went to him mildly depressed,
had trouble sleeping.
I ended up wildly depressed,
not sleeping at all.
You believe your condition worsened
under Dr Lecter's care?
Care?
He told me to eat more red meat
and wrote a prescription.
And have you been taking
the medication he prescribed?
Hell, no.
He wanted to administer phototherapy
to advance my circadian rhythms,
help me sleep,
but it wasn't phototherapy.
He stuck me in front of a light
and I woke up somewhere else.
Dr Lecter told me you had
a seizure response to phototherapy.
No, he did something to me.
You experienced a traumatic event
that you now associate with Dr Lecter.
I nearly choked on my own tongue
and he remained indifferent.
How is one patient worthy of compassion
and another not?
I'm under no illusions
how morally consistent
my compassion has been.
How is one murderer worthy
of compassion and not another?
All that time you were with Hannibal,
behind the veil,
you'd already killed one patient.
Did it ever occur to you
to kill another?
My relationship with Hannibal
is not as passionate as yours.
You are here, visiting an old flame.
Is your wife aware
of how intimately
you and Hannibal know each other?
She's aware enough.
You couldn't save Hannibal.
Do you think you can save
this new one?
Your experience of Hannibal's attention
is so profoundly harmful,
yet so irresistible...
it undermines your ability
to think rationally.
I am thinking rationally.
You've made some
very serious accusations.
Actionable accusations?
- Yes.
- And have you?
- Taken action?
- Is that what you want me to do?
Isn't that what you're supposed to do
on my behalf? And you haven't.
I am not firmly convinced
it would be in your best interest.
I am not firmly convinced you give
a rat's ass about my best interests!
Do you believe me?
I believe you are experiencing
a lack of insight.
I am trying to assist you
in regaining enough insight
that you realise
that you require medication.
What medication would you prescribe,
Dr Du Maurier?
I would prescribe exactly the medication
Dr Lecter prescribed and you refused.
You know, whatever this is,
whatever this is, this is why
Scientologists hate psychiatry.
What do you think this is?
Of course he would refer me to you!
You're just as twisted as he is.
You're walking down the street
and you see
a wounded bird in the grass.
What's your first thought?
It's vulnerable,
I want to help it.
My first thought is also
that it's vulnerable.
And yet...
I want to crush it.
A primal rejection of weakness
which is every bit as natural
as the nurturing instinct.
Of course, I wouldn't crush it.
But my first thought is to do just that.
You know, I gave up free will.
I continue to act and feel
as though I have it, but I don't.
The only reason I'm here is
it was prescribed.
- Neil, sit down.
- No! No!
This is culty and weird.
Let me help you.
I'm trying to clear your airway.
One thing I learned from Hannibal
is the alchemy of lies and truths.
It's how he convinced you
you're a killer.
You're not convinced?
You're not a killer.
You're capable of righteous violence
because you are compassionate.
How are you capable?
Extreme acts of cruelty require...
a high level of empathy.
The next time you have
an instinct to help someone,
you might consider
crushing them instead.
It might save you
a great deal of trouble.
It was done carefully and cleanly
with a very sharp knife.
It was not the work of a child.
It's a Chinese character
which means "you hit it",
an expression
sometimes used in gambling.
A lucky sign.
The character also appears
on a mah-jong tile.
It marks the red dragon.
"And behold a great red dragon."
Are you familiar with William Blake's
"The Great Red Dragon
and the Woman Clothed in Sun"?
Blake's Dragon stands
over a pleading woman
caught in the coil of its tail.
Few images in Western art
radiate such a unique and...
nightmarish charge
of demonic sexuality.
The man who killed
the Jacobis and the Leedses
saw something in them that
drew him and drove him to do it.
He chose them,
because something in them
spoke to him.
The Jacobis were the first to help him,
the first to lift him
into the glory of his becoming.
The Jacobis were better
than anything he knew.
Until the Leedses.
As the Dragon grows
in strength and glory,
there are families to come.
I have to believe
there is a common factor
and we will find it... soon.
Otherwise you have
to enter more houses
and see what
the Dragon has left for you.
Eleven days till the next full moon.
Tick-tock.
I like this Dragon, Will.
I don't think he's crazy at all.
I think he might be quite sane.
A magnificent thing
to watch the world
through his red haze.
Sign the register, please.
Painting study, Miss Harper.
Mr Crane? I'm Paula Harper.
You called about
the Blake watercolour.
Come with me, I'll show it to you.
You'll need this.
The museum is closed
to the general public on Tuesdays,
but art classes
and researchers are admitted.
May I ask what you're researching?
A paper on Butts.
On Thomas Butts?
You only see him in footnotes
as a patron of Blake's.
- Is he interesting?
- I'm just beginning.
We have to keep it in this box
because light will fade it.
That's why it's not on display often.
You're not allowed to touch it.
I'll display it for you.
That's the rule. OK?
Isn't it stunning?
Even the best reproductions
can't possibly do the colours justice.
It appears he used chalk as well as...
It's just this way, Mr Graham.
You know, you're the second person
who's asked to see the Blake today.
Wait here.
Paula, I have another visitor
for the Great Red Dragon.
Paula?
