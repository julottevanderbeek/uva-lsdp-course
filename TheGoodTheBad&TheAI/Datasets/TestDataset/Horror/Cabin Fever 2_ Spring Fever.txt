Ew!
l didn't see anything!
They were yelling.
They're always yelling.
All l wanted was
some peace and quiet.
Relax, man.
You just hit a moose.
A moose?
Are you sure?
Yeah, man, l see this kind
of shit all the time.
ln fact, this ain't shit
compared to what just happened
on l-95 recently.
l mean, a lady hit a moose
and the motherfucker
went right through
the windshield, man.
No.
Yeah.
l was partying
with my cousin.
- You know...
- What kind of partying?
- ...partying like...
- Okay.
...getting some hair pie
like the man from Nantucket
whose dong was so long them
bitches couldn't even fuck it?
And this fucking moose pissed
on my pussy parade, man.
l had to come down on
a Sunday because he's sitting
in the front seat of
a Volvo wide awake
with his head sticking out
the cracks in the glass and shit, man.
Poor guy.
- l had to put him down.
- Whoa.
But l got
a picture of it.
l carry this shit with me now 'cause
every time l'd tell that story
nobody would believe me.
- Laugh it off, man.
- Okay.
- This ain't shit.
- Okay.
All right?
Just get the kids to school, all right?
Yeah, okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Stop!
Winston, do you copy?
Winston, do you copy?
Yes, sir, l'm here.
Where the hell are you?
Smith Bridge Road. l'm still clearing
the scene from that bus accident.
l don't give a shit
if it's a handicapped bus
and there's a bunch of
retards splattered all over the road.
l need you
back here now.
There's a bunch
of suits up here
asking a whole lot of big-city questions
about the way we do things.
They were
up at the cabin this morning
and l need to make sure
that your stupid ass
is on the same page.
Do you get me?
Yes, sir, l'm on it.
Sandy Taylor's
fucking ridiculous.
Yo- yo, John, you were
just asleep at the wheel
for the hottest girl
in school.
Yeah, not my type.
Wait, Sandy is
not your type?
What does that even mean?
Does that mean you're gay?
Did you tell your dad?
Was he bummed, or-
Dude, you see her every day.
You know she's a nightmare.
No, l don't know that.
ln fact, neither do you.
You don't even have a type,
John, you have an obsession.
'Cassie!
Cassie, l love you!
Would you kiss me?
Would you-'
Seriously, man, don't take your fucking
blue balls out on me, man.
Don't think you're the only
dude here thinking about
taking Miss Gorgeous
to Boomtown.
l actually know you are
the only person here
dumb enough to take
a girl out whose ex-boyFriend
does have a fucking black belt
in kicking teeth in.
Look, man, l told you-
there's no way that she's
gonna go with me
just days after breaking up with him.
Why do you care anyway?
You hate the prom,
so drop it.
l know, prom blows.
But this is a whole different thing.
This is important for you.
You know what l mean?
This is like...
Besides, it really just proves how little
you know about girls anyway.
So- hey, l'm fucking talking.
Come on.
lf she broke up with him,
it's 'cause she finally realized
how big of a fucking
douchebag the guy is.
And going to prom with you, that's like
the ultimate power move, all right?
You're the smartest dude
in school,
you've fucking known
the girl your whole life,
and you're head over heels
in love with her.
All right?
l mean, come on.
Spite is almost as important
to those bitches as- as money.
You know what l mean?
She knows all this.
l mean, now that Marc
is out of the picture,
revenge is exactly
what she needs.
For every single girl
in this building,
that is the priority-
revenge.
l mean, look at those two
fucking savages right there.
Hey.
Oh, that's how it is-
All right, all right,
l'll think about it.
Just fucking do it.
Shave your pussy, get it over with.
l'm rallying for your fucking cause.
You need to do this thing.
All right,
l'm thinking about it.
You'll regret it
if you don't.
Oh, fuck.
l gotta get my goggles
from the car.
- Will you cover for me?
- What do you want me to say?
l don't know-
l'm on my fucking period, man.
Gotta get tampons.
All right,
well, hurry up.
Whatever.
Ha!
Shut up. Don't say a word.
Listen, people are talking.
And how they're talking so soon when
it's none of their fucking business,
l don't know.
But l hear things.
l don't like
what l hear.
So you and your
bullshit friends
better stay the hell
away from my girl.
Do you understand me?
Look, man...
- Get your hands off me.
- Okay.
Listen, l don't care
what she tells you
or what you think
you know, she's mine.
Do you get it?
lt's cool, man.
lt's cool?
- Yeah.
- Really?
You're dead.
lt's frustrating. It's frustrating.
You- l'm frustrating to you.
l understand that.
Honey? Honey?
Sweetie, listen to me.
Angel, please
listen to me.
Don't hang-
don't hang-
You have anything to say for
yourself before l launch into my tirade?
Nothing?
There are five weeks
Ieft in school.
Count them-
five weeks.
And you're a smart kid.
You got good grades.
You're going to college in the fall.
Why would you go and do
something so stupid
like start a fight?
Why?
l didn't start it.
l'm sorry, l didn't hear you.
What?
l said l didn't start it.
Mm-hmm.
Where are you supposed
to be right now?
Biology.
Biology.
Miss Hawker
or Mrs. Jennings?
Hawker.
Well, you better get
your little butt down there.
Not even l can
spare you from that.
Mmm.
- Jonathan?
- Yeah?
l don't want to see you
around here again, mmm?
Capisci?
Now get out.
Hi. l'm-
Place the scalpel at
the base of the throat
and carefully
make a slit
all the way down
the front
of the frog's belly.
Now...
Got in trouble for
being late, by the way.
Yeah, well, so did l.
...and tack it down...
l can't believe l missed
you getting your ass kicked.
That was, like, right after
l talked about her too.
Like telekinesis-
wait, telepathy or
teleki- which one?
You know, l don't really
want to talk about it, Alex.
l wonder if we would wait
till l left until he kicked your ass.
Somehow l don't think
it would have mattered.
Yeah, you're right. l don't even know
where l was going with that.
- Alex Hicks!
- Yes, ma'am?
Quiet!
- Sorry.
- That's strike two!
One more strike and you're
headed to the office.
- Mean old hag.
- Mm-hmm.
Now make an incision
through the muscular
tissue.
Hey.
No way.
You think what they say
about Mary is true,
- that she's pregnant?
- Shhh!
What?
Miss Hawker just told
you guys to shut up,
so shut up.
l'm trying to learn.
There's your prom date.
Oh, dude,
you know what?
Fuck what l said about taking
Cassie to the prom, man.
Serious ramifications
involved.
Big fucking problem.
Now set the heart aside.
Next is the liver.
Oh.
Aw .
Marc's a fucking
douchebag.
Mmm.
Think if our dads were millionaires,
we'd be douchebags too?
l don't know.
You would be.
You little shit.
Hey, are you all right?
Yeah.
No.
What's the problem?
l got dumped.
Ungrateful shit.
l don't know the guy,
but anybody that
would do that to you
is a fool, in my opinion.
l mean, if he didn't realize
how lucky he was,
then he's, like,
the stupidest guy on earth.
Really?
Really.
Wait wait.
Wait.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Oh, ow!
- Ow!
- Sorry, it's the braces.
lt's cool.
Uh, hey.
Hey, uh...
So what's the deal?
We gonna go to prom together or-
ls that cool?
No.
OH, well, l just-
l just assumed...
Look, kid,
you're real nice
and sweet and everything.
But this wasn't about
you and me, okay?
This was about revenge.
Re- revenge.
Yeah.
Besides, l work
for a living.
Wha-
Would you- would you please
go to prom with me? l mean-
lf l can get one of the other
girls to cover my shift,
maybe l'll meet you there.
How's that?
Yeah. Yeah yeah.
that's awesome.
That- l mean, that actually
works better for me
in the long run.
That's cool. Okay.
l will see you- prom.
See you there.
Good afternoon,
Jonathan.
Hey.
Daryl, Dane.
We heard about you
getting your butt kicked.
Heard you cried like
a little pussy.
Yeah, that's not
exactly what happened.
That's not how we
were informed.
Yeah, Alex said that
your little-
So is it now safe
to assume
that you will be coming over
tonight after all?
Uh, l don't know, you guys.
It's prom night.
News flash, John-
prom blows.
How you gonna pass up
'Bride of the Cannibals 2:
The Director's Cut'
for a gay dance?
lt's the most insane sequel ever made;
it's banned in over 26 countries.
Can you even begin to
comprehend that awesomeness?
Yeah, we heard there's
this one part
where the broad with the piranha
teeth bites the guy's dick and balls.
John, you see it
in a close-up.
That does sound good.
Yeah.
But l'm still not sure
what l'm doing tonight.
What do you mean you don't
know what you're doing?
Prom's in, like,
five hours.
Who are you gonna ask
at this point, your mother?
lf Mom would let me go
to the dance,
l'd be fucking so much
pussy tonight.
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Cassie.
Hey, do you want to
walk with me?
Yeah, sure.
Yeah?
l'll catch you guys later.
Cool?
Oh my God,
those two are so funny.
- D8D?
- Yeah.
Oh my God, l heard Dane
scored 1500 on his SATs.
- 1 550.
- What?
- Yeah.
- No way. How old is that kid?
- Like 12.
- Oh my God.
Yeah, but l think he's
living proof
that you can be smart
and stupid at the same time.
You should see when he
and Alex get together.
Oh, Alex- l haven't talked
to him in, like, forever.
lt's so weird.
How is he?
He's good, you know?
- He's still Alex.
- Yeah?
Yeah, l think we're gonna
go over to their house later
and watch some movies
or something.
Okay. So you're not
going to prom?
Nah.
Yeah, me neither.
Well, you'll probably
be disappearing
to some amazing medical
school soon, right?
l did get into Adams.
- You got into Adams?
- Yeah.
- Oh my God, why didn't you tell me?
- l'm telling you now.
Well, congratulations. That's awesome.
That's what you wanted.
Yeah, l guess it is.
- Wow.
- Thanks.
So how are you doing?
- What?
- Everything.
l don't know.
l mean, it's okay. l don't know.
l'm fine, l don't know.
Like, relationships are hard.
What can you do?
Yackety schmakety.
lt was the right
decision, though.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
You know, you're probably
the only person l know
who's actually going to do
something with their life.
- Oh, come on, that's not true.
- No, it's true.
Seriously, like, l have no
clue what l'm gonna do.
Nobody does, you know?
Oh my God, everybody's going
to be so super jealous
when you come back to town
and you're this really famous doctor
and they're all a bunch of fat
townies with ugly babies.
l'm serious. Like, even Marc was
jealous of you, you know that?
Come on, Cassie,
all these compliments you're paying me
are making me
a little uncomfortable.
Well, you know, today's the only day
you're gonna get 'em, so enjoy.
Cassie, Mom's looking for you!
- Okay.
- l guess you better get going, huh?
Yeah. Well, it was
nice talking to you, John.
- Yeah. Yeah, you too.
- Bye.
Hey, Cassie, wait up!
Hey, do you want to
go to prom with me?
Look, l know you've been through a lot-
things are a mess...
but it's prom,
you know?
l don't know, it's the last
few weeks of high school,
and l just figure it'd be the kind of
thing that we'd regret not having done.
Look, l really
want to go.
And you're the only person
l could see myself going with.
So how about it?
l can't, John.
l'm sorry.
Look, if you're worried about
me getting beat up or anything,
- don't worry about it.
- No, l'm not worried about that.
Like, l- it's just like my brother's sick
and l've got all this stuff to do.
And it's just, like,
l don't know.
lt's just too much,
you know?
- l understand.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's all right.
- Well, call me later.
- Bye.
- Bye.
'Bride of the Cannibals'
it is.
Stupid.
Here's your pancakes,
sweetie.
Oh, Lucille.
l've been dreaming about
your pancakes all day.
l know, baby.
That's what all
the young boys say.
Oh, what the fuck, man?
Bill! Bill!
- Jesus.
- Okay, Bill!
Deliver us from
all of this evilness!
Full of the devil!
l know you did it!
Bill, you gotta
breathe.
Breathe. Breathe.
In the name of all that is holy,
oh, hallelujah, Lord.
God, deliver us from
these evil evil people!
Oh! Oh my God!
Bill, you're in trouble!
Oh! Bill!
The ambulance
will be right here.
Bill, l know where
you come from, Bill.
l know you're-
come on, Bill! Oh!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Shit.
This is bad news.
This is real bad news.
Yeah?
l hope you're dressed.
l have got big news.
The entire team is going
to the prom after all.
Oh, so there's an 'l'
in team now?
John, don't try to be funny.
You're not good at it.
You're just not good at it.
Hey, don't hang up.
l didn't mean that.
No no no no no no.
John? John?
- Spit it out.
- Funny you should say that actually.
All you need to know is
that l have a date for prom.
You need to get your ass
out of fucking bed,
get on a suit and tie,
and that's it.
You know, after listening to you
rag on prom for the last week,
l think l finally
came around.
Prom blows.
That was a lot of rings.
- l'm gonna go now.
- No no, dude, come on.
Dude, please.
Please? You can't let me
go to this by myself.
You're my best friend. You can't do that.
It's not in the book.
You can't do this.
Please, man.
Please.
- Please?
- All right.
l'll go.
Thank God.
- Hey.
- Who goes there?
Police.
Open up.
Oh, okay.
Come on.
Hey, look,
she said she was 18.
l always believe what
children say.
No, man, l need to see
your delivery schedule.
- Open the fucking gate. Come on.
- Oh, okay.
Okay, all right.
l got the key right here.
- No, wrong key.
- Come on, man.
- It's a fucking emergency.
- l found it.
No.
Maybe it's this one.
Son of a bitch.
Looks like that one.
Here it is.
Gross.
Hey.
Sorry.
l didn't mean to scare you.
Rick.
What are you
doing here?
What do you mean?
l came to see you.
Me?
Yeah.
Is that not okay?
No. l mean, yes.
l mean, what about Sandy?
Oh, she's busy preparing
her prom queen speech.
Couldn't take it.
Plus l wanted
to talk to you.
Really?
Sure.
Yeah, the place-
it looks really great.
You do great work.
You think so?
Oh, yeah.
lt's beautiful.
Ungrateful little shits.
Come on.
- What if the teachers show up?
- To the pool?
Get 'em off.
Come on!
It's beautiful!
- Oh, Rick.
- Oh, Frederica.
l want to fuck you.
Wait, do you
have a condom?
l'll pull out.
What?
What's wrong?
Oh, are you
on your period?
No, l'm a virgin.
- What- what now?
- Fuck!
My tooth.
What the fuck?
Oh my God,
help me!
Oh, stay away from me.
Rick, help me.
What is wrong with you?
l bet my friends that
you would be an easy fuck,
not that you would be
all fucked up!
Help me!
You bled in my mouth!
Frederica?
Frederica, stop it!
Shit.
Frederica!
Frederica!
Aw, shit.
Whoo! Fuck!
He cleans up real good,
huh?
Where did you get that?
Um, my mom got it down
from the attic.
Well, it's very dapper.
Dapper?
l like that.
Whoo.
So should we just call it?
Head over to D8D's and
watch movies all night?
Yeah, we should.
Mm-hmm.
Well, fuck that,
motherfucker!
We're gonna get laid tonight.
l got a sure thing in there.
Come on.
This is it, baby-
one last night to hate your life just
a little bit fucking more.
This is it, motherfucker.
Two men going to prom together.
It's exactly as it should be.
Shit, man. Paperwork's
never been my thing.
Hey, careful with
those files.
Hey, uh,
l'm just the night guard.
l don't know anything about
any of that stuff.
lf this is about some kind
of bookkeeping cover-up or whatever,
l don't know nothing
about that.
Just, you know,
say no.
Hey, you haven't seen
my application
floating around at the station,
have you?
l sent one in like six months ago.
- Hey, what's today?
- Friday.
No, the fucking date, man.
Um...
Jesus! Shit!
Oh, Daddy.
You got another
fucking beer, man?
Shh.
My secret stash.
Oh, yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
Can l use your phone?
Yeah, just dial 9,
then you'll hear a dial tone,
then you dial the area code
and then your number.
It's different than a regular phone.
- Is it working?
- Herman.
lt's me, Winston.
Hey, man, l'm in some deep
fucking shit down here.
You gotta help me.
Man, turn down the 'Sepulter'
and listen to me,
motherfucker!
No, l'm fucking
serious, man.
- l-
- Hey, these guys with you?
Hold on.
No.
Fuck, man!
Now do me a fucking favor,
Man.
You gotta tell
these motherfuckers
that the water coming out
of here is bad news.
They cannot deliver it.
Do you understand me?
Why do l gotta tell them?
Man, it's jurisdiction
bullshit, you know?
Ah, beaurocracy. Okay.
Look, man, you're gonna be
a fucking hero for this.
Oh.
Hnow what kind of pussy
you're gonna get for this?
Oh, man,
you're gonna get the sashimi.
What's that?
Man, that's the primo
pussy, man-
no smell.
Fucking hero, man.
Yeah.
Thanks, man.
The water here is bull-
So where is
your hot date?
She's late.
Or not fucking coming.
l'm gonna go get
some punch.
Do you want some more?
No, it tastes like
someone pissed in it.
l'm gonna go
Iower my standards.
l can't find Rick!
l am not gonna be
embarrassed on that stage!
l am the prom queen
and he's the prom king!
Why are you trying
to ruin my life?
Sandy, nobody's trying
to ruin your life.
Perhaps he's just
in the boys' room.
Just calm down.
Miss Hawker?
Ow!
Guess who.
Cassie?
- It's me!
- Cassie!
- You're here!
- l'm here!
- Yeah, l changed my mind.
- Have some punch.
Thanks. Yeah, l thought
about what you said today.
l don't know, l just thought,
you're right. You know? It's prom.
That's so great.
l'm so glad that you're here.
- Great.
- Hey, baby.
Hey, John. Sweetheart, do you think you
can give John and l a minute?
Because l would really like
to apologize to him too.
- l'll just be a minute.
- Okay.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
l'll bring you
a fresh cup.
Bye, John.
Are you trying to
be an asshole?
l told you to
stay away from her.
But you couldn't leave
well enough alone, could you?
Could you?
You want to know something about
the girl of your dreams over there?
Not only is she
here with me and not you,
but l'm gonna be
fucking her tonight.
l'm gonna take her home
and l'm gonna fuck her
every which way l want
because l can.
And no matter what l do,
she's always gonna come back to me.
What do you think
about that?
What?
Oh, do you like that, faggot?
Stop this!
Stop this!
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you, man!
- Fuck you!
- What did you do?
- Cassie, l didn't do anything.
- That's a lie!
You did something.
Why do you always have to fight?
Asshole!
You hit like
your fucking boyFriend.
l didn't fucking
do anything!
This is bullshit!
He fucking started it!
Watch your mouth!
This is the second time today
l've had to deal with
this nonsense from you.
You're out of here. l will not tolerate
this barbaric behavior-
- Are you fucking blind? He started it!
- Out out!
l am out!
l can't get any more out than this!
School sucks!
John, wait!
Will you wait?
Wait!
Jesus Christ.
John!
John, will you wait?
Will you just wait?
John!
What, Cassie?
What? What do you want?
- l'm just sorry.
- Oh, you're sorry?
You're sorry for what?
You're sorry that l get
blamed for everything
or you're sorry that your
boyFriend's a fucking asshole?
Or you're sorry that
you're too stupid to tell the difference?
ls that it?
Huh?
You gotta be a little
clearer with me tonight
because l've got
a bit of a headache!
- John!
- Fuck you!
He is the worst human being
in this fucking school,
and you are the best.
Now how does that work?
Huh?
Hmm?
No, l want to know
about that process-
what goes
through your head.
How you can not like me, someone
you've known for your entire life,
someone who would treat you
like an absolute queen,
and instead go for
that piece of shit back there.
Why?
Because he's rich?
Because he's popular?
l mean, Jesus, Cassie,
you're not even poor.
l mean, how obvious
does it have to be?
You would have to be
practically retarded
not to see that
l'm in love with you.
Everybody sees it.
Marc sees it.
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing that is?
No.
No, of course you don't.
l'm done with it.
It's over.
l can't take it anymore,
Cassie.
Hey, kids, you're gonna
have to get back inside.
Yo, we're having
a conversation here, asshole.
Not anymore.
It's over.
You need to get your girlfriend
and take her back inside.
That's not my girlfriend, all right, man?
l'm going home.
Stop!
Get inside now!
All right.
- What the hell was that?
- l don't know.
l have a bad feeling.
We gotta get out of here.
Go.
Who are they?
l don't know.
But l don't think
that they're cops.
Now l need you to go
in there and get Alex, okay?
No matter what he says,
you get him out of there.
You drag him by the hair
if you have to, okay?
Okay. But what about
everyone else?
l'm gonna tell Principal
St. Clair what's going on,
but l'm not staying here
any longer than that.
No matter what he says,
we're getting out of here, okay?
Okay.
- Alex! Alex!
- Cassie, have you seen John?
You've got to come outside
with me right now, okay?
You just fucking
cockblocked me.
Okay. Don't get kicked out of prom.
Just come with me.
- All right.
- God!
Well well well.
lt is time
to announce
the prom king
and the prom queen!
Freak!
God, what is
taking him so long?
So what are you talking about?
There's dead bodies in here or something?
You're not listening to me!
l've had more than enough
of this from you!
- l told you to go home.
- Back off!
All right?
Now there's a dead body in the pool
and there's people
surrounding the school!
All right?
Do something!
Come on, boy, what kind
of fool do you take me for?
Principal St. Clair, there are people
with guns outside-
men in vans with guns!
Will you just look?
All right, wait a minute.
Stay right here.
Do not move.
Go!
What the hell
is going on?
They locked the doors!
Wait, what?
We're fucking trapped?
What's going on
out there?
l'm the principal
of this school!
l demand to know
what's going on.
Who is that girl?
Why is everyone looking at her?
