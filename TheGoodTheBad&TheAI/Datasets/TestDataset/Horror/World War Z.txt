that we have got to address
About 5% of the population

It is viral. It has to be viral.
There is no plausible alternative.
And like any virus, once we find its
origin, we can develop a vaccine.
- We find it, contain it...
- That's Dr. Fassbach.
He's our best bet
at figuring out what this thing is.
-and it said "zombies."
-{SCIENTISTS PROTESTING}
So, the earliest mention
of the word "zombie"
was in a memo
from Camp Humphreys in South Korea.
then we'd have a chance
of developing a vaccine to stop it.
So we send in Dr. Fassbach
there to look for the source.
The Under-Secretary
here says you were
his best investigator
when you were at the U.N.
Help Dr. Fassbach

I wanted for the circumstances

You were on the ground

Because the guy who just shot

GERRY: He was supposed

Hey.
That guy volunteered to come here.
We're still trying to figure out
what the hell this thing is.
The doctor would have
strongly agreed with you.
Body shots only seem
