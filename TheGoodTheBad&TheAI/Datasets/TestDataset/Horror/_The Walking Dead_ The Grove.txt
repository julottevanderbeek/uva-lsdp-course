The Walking Dead...
- Hi, Nick!
- They're dead now.
No, they're not.
They're just different.
You say the person that killed
Karen and David did this?
We gotta find them, Rick!
And I'm not gonna
sleep until we do.
I killed two people.
They might've lived.
That wasn't your decision to make.
I won't have you there.
Tyreese!
How'd you find us?
Look.
Those who arrive, survive.

Griselda.

You can sleep, Lizzie.
I'm okay.
If there's trouble,
I can take Judith.
I can help.
You really think
you can help me?
I know I can, ma'am.
Do you think there'll
be kids there?
At Terminus?
If their parents
kept them safe.
Like Tyreese kept
all of you safe.
I saved Tyreese.
There were people
shooting at him.
I shot them.
First a man, then a woman.
I didn't mean
to shoot her in the head.
You had to.
You saved Tyreese.
Maybe there'll be kids there,
even if their parents
couldn't keep them safe.
Maybe the kids kept
their parents safe.
Yeah.
Did you have kids?
I did.
A kid.
A daughter.
What was she like?
She was sweet.
She didn't have
a mean bone in her body.
Is that why she isn't here now?
Yeah.
Do you miss her?
Every day.
Would you miss me?
I'm not gonna have to miss you.
You're dead on your feet.
Go sleep next
to your sister, okay?
But, ma'am, I can help.
I'm gonna need your help
looking after things tomorrow.
Go to sleep, okay?
Go.
No.
No.
No, no. No.
Found some.
There you go.
Good job.
Ow.
- It hurts, right?
- Oh, yeah. It hurts.
This will fight the infection.
Might even bring
down your fever.
What do you think?
Three days out?
Four days?
We haven't seen any of those
maps at the crossings.
I'm not sure.
Lizzie's tough.
When it comes to people.
What do you mean?
You haven't seen it?
How she's confused
about them, the walkers.
She doesn't see what they are.
She thinks
they're just different.
Tyreese:
No, she's worse.
She doesn't have
a mean bone in her body.
Mica: Did "Tom Sawyer"
have a happy ending?
We never got to finish it.
Well, Tom and Huck,
they stop Injun Joe
and his partner
and wind up
getting all his gold.
- So they wind up rich?
- Mm-hmm.
And the Widow Douglas
adopts Huck.
Like you adopted us?
Yeah, just like
the Widow Douglas.
And I'm Huck Finn.
I think you're more
like Tom Sawyer.
Yeah, you're right.
You're way more like Huck Finn.
You're not even grossed out
by dead rabbits.
Forgot you used
to read to them.
I did.
- You smell that?
- Yeah.
There's a fire somewhere.
Must be a big one. It isn't
anywhere around here.
We should stop here.
We need to look for water.
I can do it.
No, you need to rest.
Rest your arm.
Mica will help me.
I spy trees and weeds.
Your turn.
Here.
You stay here.
Tyreese.
Sometimes we have to kill them.
I know that.
But sometimes we don't.
You know Lizzie can carry
a lot more than me.
I had you come because
I wanted to talk to you.
Why?
Because you're little
and you're sweet
and those are two things
that can get you killed.
You can't change
how big you are...
I wish I could.
...but you can
toughen up.
I don't have to be tough.
I can run.
I'm good at that.
No.
My daughter ran
and it wasn't enough.
That's why I taught the kids at
the prison to do more than that.
I can kill walkers.
I mean, I've tried.
I'm not like my sister.
I'm not messed up.
I know what they are.
But I can't kill people.
I could never do that.
When the bad people
were at the prison,
they were right in front of us
and I held up my gun,
but I couldn't
pull the trigger.
Killing people is wrong.
Someone killed Karen and David.
They just killed them.
They were nice.
What about people
who try to kill you?
I don't even wish I could.
People came in
and killed our friends.
And I feel sorry for them.
Why?
Because they probably
weren't like that before.
Sooner or later
you're gonna have to do it.
You'll have to do it
or you'll die.
So you're gonna change
the way you think about it.
You have to change.
Everyone does now.
Things don't just work out.
Look.
My mom used to say everything works
out the way it's supposed to.
Mica:
What are these?
- Carol: Pecans.
- Oh, I love pecans.
You know, maybe we could catch
our breath here for a while.
We're still going
to Terminus, right?
We'll just stay a day or two.
There's a well full of water.
Fences.
They're not big,
but they're something.
And we saw deer.
They eat pecans.
We should be able
to kill one to eat.
We can eat these, too, right?
You can eat your fill
and then some.
Look.
Bet that's what
we were smelling.
Looks far enough away.
I wonder how it started.
Maybe lightning.
Maybe a campfire.
I can patch that fence.
It's probably where
the deer are coming from.
We should leave it. Just
play it really safe in here.
If there's one in there,
it's not moving much.
Let's just stay close,
go slow room to room.
Girls, you sit tight.
You don't come in until we come
out no matter what you hear.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Lizzie's got Judith.
Mica, get out your gun.
You're gonna need
to stand watch.
Stand strong, little lady.
They're gonna be okay.
It's not that.
Is it that there was a baby?
No.
They're gonna find one in
there and they're going--
Stop it.
They aren't people.
But you're wrong.
All of you.
They aren't people, Lizzie.
They're just dead.
-
-
Stop! Stop! Stop!
- Are you okay?
-
All right, come on.
Come on.
Tyreese: Come on, come on.
I got you, little girl.
- Come on. Come here.
- Got her? Mica.
Mica, lower the gun.
You did it.
You saved them.
Why are you upset, Lizzie?
Were you scared?
No.
Then why are you crying?
I don't want to say.
Tyreese:
Lizzie.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Just look at the flowers
like you're supposed to.
Look at the pink ones
over there. You see?
Both:
One, two, three.
You still upset?
Sometimes I don't understand,
but I'm trying to, ma'am.
I am.
Look what I found.
I'm gonna name her
Griselda Gunderson.
Well, we got plenty of water.
Now all we got to do is bag one
of them deer and we're all set.
- Then we'll get one.
- Yeah.
- What's wrong?
- I'm not used to this.
Used to what?
We're in a living room
in a house.
Yeah, so relax.
We should live here.
-
- Lizzie.
Come on.
- You get away from it!
- No, no, no!
- Right now, Lizzie.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no.
- Lizzie! Lizzie!
No! No!
She was playing with me.
She wanted a friend.
She wanted to kill you.
- I was gonna lead her away.
- You could have died.
It's the same thing!
You killed her!
- You killed her! It's the same thing!
- Lizzie.
- What if I killed you?!
What if I killed you?! - Lizzie.
- You don't understand.
You don't understand. - Lizzie.
You don't understand. You don't understand.
You don't understand!
Lizzie. Lizzie.
You didn't have to.
You didn't have to.
She didn't want to hurt any...
She didn't want
to hurt anybody!
She was my friend
and you killed her!
You killed her!
She was my friend.
Carol:
Is it too heavy?
Nah, I'm good.
The fire's still burning.
Carol:
Nope.
The smoke's black.
If it was white, the fire
wouldn't be burning anymore.
I miss science class.
Except for when
we had to do stuff like
cut up planaria worms.
You've got to do worse
than that nowadays, Mica.
- I don't gotta.
- You do.
Lizzie's bigger than you and
in some ways she's stronger.
But you're smarter
and you understand
these... things.
You've got to look out for her.
You have to--
No, go ahead.
You do it.
Just like I showed you at the prison.
Go ahead.
I can't.
We have peaches.
Maybe we don't need
to go to Terminus.
I've been thinking.
Mica's right.
We can stay here.
We can live here.
I know Lizzie and Mica.
I know Judith.
I know you.
I trust you.
And I don't know if I can
get that anywhere else.
We could stay.
We can live here.
Lizzie?
Lizzie?
Don't worry.
I'll get you more.
Mica:
When we were giving them names,
we were just pretending
things weren't bad.
Things are bad.
Those things, they're bad.
They are.
I'm not pretending.
You were.
I know.
I can hear them.
They want to kill you.
They just want me to change.
They can make me be like them.
Maybe I should change.
Stop it.
I can make you all understand.
- Lizzie.
-
Lizzie, they're coming.
Lizzie!
Carol!
Help!
Help, Carol!
Lizzie!
- Lizzie!
- Mica!
- Mica!
- Lizzie!
- Let me go! Help me!
-
-  Help!
- Get behind us!
It's okay.
You did it.
I had to help stop them.
Do you understand
what they are now?
I know--
I know what I have to do now.
I know.
It's ugly and it's scary
and it does change you.
That's how we get to be here.
That's the cost.
That's growing up now.
Mica: I don't want
to hurt anyone.
I don't want to be mean.
You have to be sometimes.
But just sometimes.
No. No.
Now we have a lot
of pecans here.
A ton.
- You getting sick of them yet?
- Nope.
I used to make these with my
grandma when I was little.
They smell good.
There you go.
All right.
I think you guys are ready to start
doing the cooking around here.
Who wants to put 'em in?
Me.
The girls like it here.
We could build it up,
plant more food.
We could find a car for an
escape route just in case.
If you don't want to go to
Terminus, we could stay.
We could.
It doesn't mean
we can't go someday.
It's just...
when we were getting
closer and closer,
I realized
I'm just not ready to be
around other people yet.
You don't have to.
I dream about Karen.
I see her every night.
And every time
I forget she's dead.
Sometimes...
we just talk.
And sometimes
I see her in the crowd...
in a city I've never been to.
And it's back before
everything happened.
And then...
I see someone kill her.
Some stranger.
Then I lose her all over again.
But that's the deal, right?
The people who are living
are haunted by the dead.
We are who we are.
And we do what we do
'cause they're still here.
In our heads.
In the forest.
The whole world is haunted now.
And there's no
getting out of that.
Not until we're dead.
Tyreese.
Maybe they're not haunting us.
Maybe they're just teaching us.
Helping remind us so--
so that we can live
with what we have to do.
Hey.
Don't you ever be ashamed
of who you are, Carol.
You did right by those girls.
You did right by everyone.
We'll get one yet.
Probably not even deer season.
My husband used to hunt.
He'd tell the same
stupid joke every year.
You gonna tell it?
Well, I guess
I have to now, right?
You do.
Okay.
What's the difference between
beer nuts and deer nuts?
Beer nuts
are around 1.79,
deer nuts are just
under a buck.
That's good stupid,
but in no way
is it stupid good.
Yeah, I told you.
There's more where that came from.
Don't worry.
She'll come back.
I didn't hurt her brain.
No, no, no!
We have to wait.
I need to show you.
You'll see.
You'll finally get it.
We have to wait.
Lizzie, put the gun down.
I just want us to wait.
We can wait.
We can wait.
You just give me the gun.
We can wait, I swear.
You and Tyreese
should take Judith back.
It's not safe for her.
But Judith can change, too.
- I was just about to--
- She can't even walk yet.
Yeah, you're right.
So you two take Judith
back to the house
and we'll have lunch.
And I'll just tie Mica up.
You know, just so
she won't go anywhere.
Promise that's what you'll do?
Mm-hmm.
I promise.
I'll use her shoelaces.
Let's--
let's go, Lizzie.
I brought her some food.
Cleared out her room.
Made sure she didn't
have any knives,
anything like that.
She has a shoe box
full of mice.
I asked her if she was the one
feeding the walkers at the prison.
And at the tombs,
we found this rabbit
pulled apart and nailed
to a board.
That was her, too.
Said she was just having fun.
I was thinking,
maybe she killed
Karen and David.
But I don't know how
she could drag them away.
She would have let them turn.
It wasn't her.
So what do we do?
I could leave with her.
What?
We can't sleep with her and
Judith under the same roof.
You wouldn't make it.
Not on your own.
She can't be around
other people.
Maybe we could try to help her.
Talk her back somehow.
This is how she is.
It was already there.
I didn't see it.
- How could you?
- I should have seen it.
So maybe we go.
Me and Judith.
You won't make it either.
She can't be around
other people.
You should pick
some wildflowers for Mica
to give her
when she comes back.
Yeah, she'd love that.
The fire's still burning.
No.
The smoke's white.
It's out.
You know everything, ma'am.
No, I don't.
What is it?
What is it?
Are you mad at me?
Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?
I'm sorry I pointed
my gun at you.
I just needed you to wait.
I know.
I'm sorry.
You're mad at me.
I love you, Lizzie.
And everything works out
the way it's supposed to.
I'm sorry.
Please don't be mad at me.
I'm sorry.
You just-- just look
at the flowers, Lizzie.
Just look at the flowers.
Just-- just look
at the flowers.
-
-
I killed Karen and David.
I had to stop
other people from dying.
It wasn't Lizzie.
It wasn't a stranger.
Tyreese, it was me.
You do what you have to do.
Did she know
what was happening?
Was she scared?
It was quick?
Yes.
Do what you have to do.
I forgive you.
It happened.
You did it.
You feel it.
I know you do.
It's a part of you now.
Me, too.
But I forgive you.
Thank you.
We don't need to stay.
We can't stay.
