MAN:
The box.
Take it, it's yours.
It always was.
-
-
MAN:
JULIA:
- Okay, okay.
- Well, maybe somebody changed the lock.
Like who?
Who's gonna change this lock?
Well, I don't know.
It was just a suggestion.
Ah. Success.
Voila.
Well, this is it...
the old homestead.
Yuck. It smells damp.
Well, it's... been empty
for a while, hasn't it?
But we'll soon warm it up
and get it feeling like a home.
How long since you were here?
Oh, the better part of 10 years.
I wanted to sell it after
the old lady died,
but I couldn't get Frank to agree.
I guess he needed a
hideout or something.
Would you look at this?
And don't worry,
this stuff means nothing to me.
It all goes.
I thought half of it
was your brother's.
I've never known him to kick
cash out of bed. Besides...
He's probably behind
bars someplace.
We have to let Kirsty
see this place
before we do a thing to it.
You really want to move in here?
You don't like it?
I suppose it's better
than Brooklyn.
Oh, don't start, Julia.
- Don't start what?
- Look.
We can make it work here.
Now I've got a terrific job,
We  be happy.
- All right, all right.
- So what's the argument?
- No argument.
-
MAN: Honey...
Shit.
Larry! Larry!
- Where are you?
-
Squatters?
Frank.
- He's here?
-
I mean, there's stuff in the
kitchen you wouldn't believe.
He's obviously made one
of his famous getaways.
What the hell is that?
- Who is this?
- KIRSTY:
- Kirsty!
- I got through.
- Barely. Where are you?
- I found a room.
-
- I said, I found a room.
Wait, I thought you
were going to stay
- with us for a while.
-
You'd like my room.
I'd really like you to see
this house. It's something else.
Maybe in the next couple of days.
I gotta find myself a job.
What for, sweetie?
Look, you've already made the
gesture, there's no need...
dad, this isn't a gesture.
This is something I need to do.
Come on and trust
me a little, okay?
- Call me tomorrow.
- I will. I'll see you.
Bye, dad.
So?
Why not?
Great.
We'll move in on Sunday.
LARRY: Listen, look out for the
molding on the way through here.
- LARRY:
- MAN:
- LARRY:
-
LARRY:
Don't worry, it'll get through.
- All right. What's the matter?
- Hey, you got my arm!
- LARRY:
-
- MAN:
- LARRY:
Let's take five, guys.
How's things in there?
- Looks like a bomb dropped.
- You got any beer?
There's some in the fridge.
Oh, well...
Why don't I get it?
I've got nothing better to do.
Excuse me.
- My lucky day.
- Hi.
- Do you wanna buy a bed?
- Not much.
Dad?
- LARRY:
- Hi.
Hello, sweetie. Come here.
- Here you go.
- MAN:
This is a big house.
- You like?
- Yeah.
Me like.
I'll give you the grand tour if we
ever get this goddamn bed moved.
- Is Julia here?
- She's upstairs.
Look, be gentle with her, okay?
- She hates moving.
- Surprise.
- Kirsty.
- Okay, all right. I'll be nice.
You get on with the grunt work
- and I'll make myself some coffee.
- That's a great idea.
- There's the kitchen.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Is that your daughter?
- Uh-huh.
- Got her mother's looks.
- Her mother's dead.
Oh.
Come on.
Oh, shit.
FRANK:
Can I come in?
-
- That's right.
Who are you?
I'm Frank.
I'm brother Frank.
Oh, yes!
I... I came for the wedding.
Well, can I come in or not?
I'm sorry. Of course.
You're very welcome.
Yeah. Well, that's nice to know.
Do you have a towel?
KIRSTY:
Kirsty.
There's one in the bathroom.
Oh, by the way, did daddy
tell you I got a room?
It's not that big, but it's okay.
Julia?
- Julia?
-
FRANK:
Wedded bliss?
I'm very happy.
I'm sure you are.
JULIA'S VOICE:
I need to... take the weight
away from me, my foot's caught.
- You got it?
- I got it.
Now just push it to me as I pull.
It's never enough.
Julia. Jul...
Please.
I'll do anything you want.
Anything.
Here.
Oh, is it deep?
I don't know. I haven't looked.
You know me and blood.
- I'm gonna faint.
- You're  going to faint.
Oh, shit!
- L... le... let me see.
- Shit!
Oh, it's going to need stitches.
- I'm gonna throw up.
- You're  going to throw up.
- Just take it easy, just take it easy.
- I'm gonna throw up.
- It's going to be all right.
-
Let's get you to the hospital.
- LARRY:
-
What happened?
It was just an accident.
He's all right.
Look, will you drive?
He needs stitches.
- Yeah, sure.
- The keys are in the kitchen.
- So stupid.
- It's all right.
LARRY:
-
- LARRY:
This doctor is poking around
with all the delicacy and
compassion of Josef Mengele,
and I'm warning him, "listen,
I'm gonna pass out."
He says, "oh no, of course you're not
old boy. Of course you're not."
The next thing you know,
I'm on the floor
and he's standing there like
he's the one who needs help.
MAN: He probably is afraid
you're gonna sue him.
I should do it! Bill, I should do it.
You know all about that stuff.
I'll call you tomorrow.
We'll sue his ass.
- Doctors.
- That's right, honey.
LARRY: And what's my
darling daughter drinking?
JULIA:
Listen, Julia,
you want some more bubbly?
Uh no. No more for me, thanks.
Okay. Okay, stop.
-  to stand up.
- So lie down.
Would you all excuse me?
I think I'm going to go to bed.
- Are you all right, darling?
- Uh-huh.
I think we ought to
be making a move, too.
LARRY:
Absolutely not!
This is the night of
the paper hats here.
We're celebrating
something, so sit down.
Good night.
You'll have to come to us next.
WOMAN: Yeah, real soon.
I'm glad you're back.
Thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- WOMAN:
- What?
Oh.
No, only when I drink.
-
-
Oh, God.
Oh! Christ!
Julia.
Oh my God.
Don't look at me.
Who...
who are you?
I said don't look.
Help me!
Tell me who you are.
Frank.
No.
No!
Believe me, it's me.
His blood on the floor,
it brought me back.
Back?
From where?
Just help me, will you?
Please, God, help me!
- Somebody...
- Wait.
You can't leave me like this.
You can't.
What do you want me to do?
The blood brought me this far.
I need more.
You have to heal me.
Hi.
Are you all right?
MAN:
No, I'm here.
Good night.
So why didn't you stay
at Larry's house?
There's plenty of room.
Oh, yeah, there's room,
and there's Julia.
- Ah. I see.
-
She's like you.
She's so damn polite.
Oh, yeah? Meaning what?
Oh, I don't know.
She's uptight and frigid.
I beg your pardon.
See, there you go.
"I beg your pardon."
Hey, we're not all frigid.
- Oh, no?
- Oh, no.
Oh, no?
Oh, no.
That's not what I heard.
Well, you must have been
speaking to all the wrong people.
Anything?
Anything.
You'll do it?
Yes...
I will.
Kirsty? Kirsty?
- Kirsty!
- Ah!
- You all right?
-
I-I don't know.
I-I was dreaming.
Daddy!
Hello.
I'm all right, honey.
I just wanted to make
sure you were okay.
Never better.
- Now you sleep well, okay?
-
I love you, sweetie.
Bye.
- JULIA:
- She had a bad dream.
-
- Kirsty.
Kirsty.
- Not much fun, is it?
- JULIA:
Drinking alone.
Not much.
Well...
If we're both on our own, maybe
we could have a drink together.
Why not?
You know, it's not often that I...
You know.
There's a first time
for everything.
That's right, yeah.
I suppose that's right.
Would you... like a drink?
Oh, no no no.
I'm  over my limit.
You know, it's funny,
but I...
I feel like I've known
you for years, you know?
What's the matter?
It's what you brought
me here for, isn't it?
Well, isn't it?
I suppose so, yes.
So what's your problem?
Let's get on with it.
You're not gonna change
your fucking mind, are you?
I'm sorry.
Let's go upstairs.
Okay okay. Sorry, okay? Okay.
- Right.
-
This isn't the bedroom.
No.
So what's going on?
We don't need a bed, do we?
Well, no, I suppose not.
I've always preferred the floor.
Oh. First time for everything, eh?
Why don't you...
Take your jacket off?
Yeah, why don't I?
Why don't you do the same thing?
Maybe I will.
You're  beautiful.
Am I?
Oh, you know you are.
Loveliest woman... I've ever seen.
Oh, Christ.
What's wrong?
Just one minute.
Too much drink.
Empty the old bladder.
Did you lock this?
Please! Please!
FRANK:
Jesus Christ.
Ah!
See?
It's making me whole again.
Every drop of blood you spill
puts more flesh on my bones.
And we both want that, don't we?
- Uh...
- Good.
Come here.
Come here, damn you,
I wanna touch you.
Come to daddy.
-
- LARRY:
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.
I was calling for you.
Didn't you hear?
Are you in there?
You want a cookie, little girl?
I'm feeling sick.
Oh, babe. Is there
anything I can get you?
Maybe a... a Brandy.
It's coming right up.
Okay.
There's no hurry.
Frank?
- Oh.
- I'm hurting.
Hurting?
My nerves are beginning
to work again.
Good.
One more, maybe two...
- Not again.
- ...To heal me completely.
Then we can be away from here
before they start to follow.
- Who?
- The Cenobites.
It's only a matter of time before
they find I've slipped them.
I must get away from here.
LARRY:
Just a moment.
Put on some music. Will you, babe?
LARRY:
Poor Larry, obedient as ever.
Keep your voice down.
Don't want "babe" to hear.
You're hurting.
You won't cheat me, will you?
You'll stay with me, help me.
Then we can be together
the way we were before.
We belong to each other now.
For better,
for worse.
Like love...
Only real.
I'm sorry... I'm new here.
You're gonna have to wait.
Could you not do that? Please!
Where's the manager?
That's a problem too, because
he's out to lunch right now.
I want to see somebody in charge.
Then you're gonna have to wait.
- Excuse me.
- Well, excuse me!
What are you doing?
Give those back.
-
- Oh my God.
Get out.
You get out of here.
-
- Hi.
Hi.
Just came by to see what
you're doing after work.
What's wrong?
- Something weird.
- What?
Nothing.
You're sure we're not
gonna be interrupted?
Quite sure.
Only I... uh...
I like to be careful.
I can taste that.
It's a long time since
I tasted anything.
You promised me an explanation.
This is it.
- Let me see.
- No, don't touch it!
It's dangerous. It opens doors.
What kind of doors?
Doors to the pleasures
of heaven or hell.
I didn't care which.
-
-
They won't get me back.
I'm going to live and you're
going to help me, yes?
Yes.
They'll never find us,
not in the whole wide world.
ANNOUNCER:
I thought this kind of
stuff made you sick.
-
- I've seen worse.
Are you all right?
Fine.
-
- 'Cause we can watch something else.
If you feel like. Get him! Get him!
-
- Ah! No! No!
What was that?
I think I left a
window open upstairs.
- I'll go see.
- No.
It was nothing.
Larry!
What's the matter with you anyway?
It's just that I hate the thunder.
I'm here.
You're safe.
You're trembling.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Look.
I really should check it out.
Don't go up there, please.
We'll both go up. Come on.
- Larry, please!
- Don't worry about it. Come on.
- Don't.
- It's okay. It's okay.
It's probably a rat.
I told you.
Let's go downstairs.
I'll make it better.
No, this is enough light.
Let's go, come on.
Let's go inside.
Oh, yes.
Yes. Yes.
No.
No!
Please, no!
Please stop!
I can't bear it! Please, no!
I don't understand you.
I mean, one minute...
You're all over me, and the next...
I just don't understand you.
I don't know.
Maybe we shouldn't have come back.
Brooklyn certainly wasn't
any worse than this.
Look.
You love her, so there must
be something worth loving.
I wish it were that simple.
I've got a real
problem here, kiddo.
She doesn't even want
to leave the house.
Really?
It's like she's...
- Waiting for something.
-
I don't know.
I don't know.
It's way beyond me.
Look.
Could you... would you...
Uh-oh.
stop by sometime?
Try to make friends?
Sure.
Who knows, maybe all she needs
is somebody to talk to.
- You can't love him.
- JULIA:
- So where's the harm?
- I said
Then find me somebody else,
before they come looking.
Now!
I...
I get lonely sometimes.
Everybody does.
Come in.
What is this,
Jesus Christ!
Oh, Christ! Help me!
Don't!
- Get out of here!
- Please.
- Don't let him kill me.
-
Help me.
No.
- Kirsty, it's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
- No!
- You remember.
- No!
- Come to daddy.
- Get the fuck off of me!
You've grown. You're beautiful.
Don't...
don't touch me!
Don't touch me or so help me I...
I...
what will you do?
There's nothing to be afraid of.
I bet you make your daddy so proud.
Don't you, beautiful?
- This isn't happening.
- I used to tell myself that.
Used to try and pretend I
was dreaming all the pain.
But don't you kid yourself.
Some things have to be endured,
and that's what makes the
pleasures so
-
- Oh!
No!
Give me that!
- No.
- Give it to me!
You want it?
One last time:
Give me that box.
-
- Give me the box!
You want it? Fucking have it!
No!
-
-  Kirsty.
It's Frank. You remember,
It's Uncle Frank.
Are you all right?
You're awake.
- Good girl.
- What happened?
- I'll get the doctor.
- Wait a minute. How did I get here?
I won't be a moment.
Please, get back into bed.
I have to call my father.
That's easily arranged,
but first, back into bed.
It's important. It really is...
first things first.
We'll get you a telephone
after we've talked.
What about this? Ring any bells?
You were hanging onto
it like grim death.
I don't remember.
Well, the police will
want to speak to you.
- You know that.
- Oh, Christ.
In the meantime, maybe
will jog your memory.
Shit.
Open!
Oh, come on!
The box. You opened it,
we came.
It's just a puzzle box!
Oh, no.
It is a means to summon us.
Who are you?
Explorers in the further
regions of experience:
Demons to some, angels to others.
It was a mistake!
I didn't...
I didn't mean to open it!
You can all...
Go to hell!
- We can't. Not alone.
- You solved the box,
we came, now you must come with us.
- Taste our pleasures.
-
Please, go away and leave me alone!
Oh, no tears, please.
It's a waste of good suffering.
Wait! Wait! Wait! Please, wait!
No time for argument.
You've done this before, right?
PINHEAD:
To a man called Frank Cotton?
Oh, yes.
He escaped you.
Nobody escapes us.
He did. I've seen him.
I've seen him.
- WOMAN:
- He's alive!
Supposing he had escaped us.
What has that to do with you?
I... I can...
I can lead you to him,
and you can take him
back instead of me.
Perhaps we prefer you.
I want to hear him confess himself,
then maybe...
But if you cheat us...
We'll tear your soul apart.
She'll tell them everything.
I don't think so.
She'll want to warn Larry first.
-
- That's probably her now...
- Or the police.
- It doesn't make any difference.
Don't you care?
What I care about is a new skin.
Maybe we should just leave.
Like this? Look at me.
We can't just stay here.
My brother will be home soon.
What is it?
I don't know where to begin.
What are you talking about?
It's best you see for yourself.
NURSE:
STEVE:
I'll start looking for her.
Maybe she's gone back to...
To her father's house.
Daddy?
Daddy, it's me,
it's Kirsty! Let me in!
- Kirsty? It's very late.
- Where is my dad?
- What's the matter?
- I want to see my father!
Of course.
-
-
KIRSTY:
-
-
Daddy?
- Daddy, you're okay. You're all right.
- Sure I am. I am.
- You're okay!
- It's okay.
I was so afraid that
something happened to you.
I know, I know.
I need to talk to you.
Yeah. Of course.
It's okay, baby,
Julia told me everything.
Oh, no, see...
Your brother Frank is upstairs.
He's upstairs and he's
trying to kill you.
- He's gonna kill you!
- No, wait wait wait.
Whatever Frank did was unspeakable.
Unspeakable.
But believe me,
it's finished with now.
Why is it finished?
He's gone.
What does "gone" mean?
He's dead, Kirsty.
He was insane, baby,
a mad dog. I had to put
him out of his misery.
Jesus, what a scene.
And when I'm feeling better,
I'll go to the police and try
to make them understand.
God knows...
I don't really understand myself.
Did he hurt you, baby?
No, I'm okay.
He's better off dead.
Poor Frank.
I don't believe this.
- I don't believe this.
- Believe it.
I need to see him.
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I
Yes.
Show her.
We want the man
who did this.
No.
He's my father and
you can't have him.
No!
Ah! Move.
Kirsty...
Move!
What's the matter?
There's no time.
Wait, no wait. I told you
all that's over with now.
No, it's not!
We've got to get out of here!
No, stay with us.
We can all be happy here.
No.
Come to daddy.
Oh my God!
Come...
- Ah!
- Frank!
Well...
So much for the cat-
and-mouse shit!
No!
It's nothing personal, baby.
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.
Oh no.
Oh my God.
No, don't mourn him.
He was dead long before
we ever touched him.
- Bastard!
- Now, hush now.
Everything's all right.
- Frank's here.
- Bastard!
Your dear old Uncle Frank.
-
-
What the hell is that?
Frank.
No!
We had to hear it
from your own lips.
This isn't for your eyes.
You set me up,
bitch!
"Jesus wept."
Not leaving us so soon, are you?
Ah!
We have such sights to show you.
Oh, shit.
- No! Don't do that!
- Go to hell!
Kirsty!
Kirsty!
No.
Steve.
No!
Oh, shit!
Oh, Kirsty! Thank God you're okay.
Let's get the hell out of here!
Now!
Oh, no.
Oh, God. No.
Open!
Steve!
No!
- What's your pleasure, sir?
-
