Come on, look for it.
I know it`s here.
- There!
- Over to the right.
That`s it. There it is!
That`s it. All right!
- This is it, all right.
- Let`s rip this sucker open!
Get a look at the main man!
Come on, dig! Deeper!
Come on, dig. Come on, let`s dig!
Come on, faster! Dig!
Get the dirt off and we`ll open it.
This is it.
Come on!
Come on.
- Pry.
- Move it over here.
Harder. Come on.
- Come on, Neil!
- OK, here it comes.
No...please, no!
That must be the new kid.
Last stop. Everybody out.
No? Beautiful. Sit there.
l don`t give a shit.
How you doing?
Tommy Jarvis?
Hi, my name is Pam Roberts.
l`m the assistant director.
l`m glad you`re here.
lf you`d like to grab your things,
l`ll take you in to meet the doctor.
Great.
Thank you.
Anytime, doll.
How was the ride?
Come on, Tommy.
You OK?
- Come in.
- Hi.
Hi, Tommy. l`m Matthew Letter.
Welcome to Pinehurst. Have a seat.
Sit down, son.
l`ll tell you
a little about Pinehurst,
then we`ll let you get settled.
How`s that sound?
How does that sound?
Sure.
All right. About Pinehurst,
you`ll find we`re very different
from the state institution.
We don`t have any guards here.
Nobody tells you what to do.
- Basically, you`re your own boss.
- lt`s an honour system.
What you`re really doing here, Tommy,
is preparing yourself to re-enter
society and start a new life.
Pam, wanna point Tommy toward
his room and get him started?
Sure. OK? Go through the kitchen,
up the stairs,
and it`s the first door
on your left, OK? See you in a bit.
- What do you think?
- The kid`s a real talker.
l noticed.
How`d they diagnose him?
``Severe trauma at age 12.
``Brutal self-defence murder
of a psychopathic killer.``
They`ve given him every therapy
and treatment they can think of.
lt`s a wonder his mind
isn`t fried from all the drugs.
You scared of spiders?
You scared of rubber spiders?
Scared of rubber spiders on strings?
Man, you are one scared cat.
Where l come from,
you learn to be scared of nothing.
They call me Reggie the Reckless.
No spider scares me.
Joke, man!
- Don`t.
- Don`t get all twisted out of shape.
- You act like you made these things.
- l did.
Solid.
So you`re the new nut?
- ls that what they call us?
- ``Us``? l ain`t one of you.
l`m just visiting.
My granddaddy works here.
Gotta split.
Catch you later. There`s action.
Joey, come on. Hurry up.
Oh, my God!
Hey, you guys! Joey, come on.
Stop, Grandpa! Don`t!
- Hey, Matt. How`s it going?
- All right. What`s up?
lt`s like we talked about.
You got some neighbours who
aren`t happy about your place.
l respect
what you`re trying to do, Matt, l do.
But we found a couple of your kids
on the Hubbard place again.
- Deputy! Bring `em out.
- Yes, sir.
Everybody out.
Stop fooling around. Fall in.
- Yes, sir.
- Move, wise guy.
We found them in Hubbard`s woods
screwing their heads off, Matt.
We`re lucky this time,
because Ethel didn`t see them.
l`ll take care of it, Sheriff.
- l`ll do the talking. Keep quiet.
- Morning, Ethel.
- Don`t you look lovely?
- Horseshit!
Sheriff, you better hear me good.
l want this loony bin closed down.
You hear? These kids
ain`t nothing but trouble!
They disrespect property,
and they`re all crazy!
- You tell `em, Ma!
- These kids weren`t doing...
Doing? Doing?!
You think l don`t know what those
two perverts were doing in my yard!
- Say it like you mean it, Ma!
- Would you shut the fuck up?
l`ll tell all of you.
You mark my words,
the next bastard comes near my farm,
l`ll blow your fucking brains out.
You hear?
Don`t you come near me, Sheriff,
l`ve warned you.
l`ve got a bomb on me.
l swear to you!
Make one move toward me,
l`m gonna blow us all up.
Start the engines, Junior.
That`s it. My final words.
OK, people, let`s go. Party`s over.
She`s really something, ain`t she?
Seriously, try to keep
your kids off her property.
l will.
l understand
you got the Jarvis kid today.
- He arrived earlier.
- And?
- And what?
- What`s he like?
He`s like any other kid.
He`s been through a lot.
- Yeah. Good luck with him, pal.
- Thanks a lot, Sheriff.
- Hi, girls.
- Hi, Joey.
Hi, Violet.
- What are you doing?
- Laundry, Joey.
Can l help? l`m very good at laundry.
Matt never assigns it to me.
- Look, we have to get this finished.
- So l`m here to help you.
You can count on me, Rob.
You too, Vi.
Want a chocolate bar?
Here, you want it?
- l`ll give you half.
- Piss off!
Please let me help you.
lt`s no problem...
- Get out of here!
- Fuck!
l`m sorry.
l can do laundry great.
But if that`s how you feel,
forget it.
l`ll just go help somebody else
instead. l`ll see you later.
lf you change your mind,
l`ll be right around...
Jesus, what a loser.
Look at this sheet.
l`m not gonna wash it, you wash it.
- Hi, Vic!
- Get lost.
Don`t be like that.
Let me help you with the wood.
And anyway,
l got two chocolate bars, see?
- Don`t tell the girls.
- What an asshole.
You know, Vic, before l came here,
l never had anything to do,
me being an orphan and all.
People always teased me about
sitting round like some kind of pig.
But here, it`s different. l can
help others and do a lot of things.
You know something?
l really love it here.
l hate it!
You know, to be honest with you,
l never chopped wood before,
but it certainly looks like fun.
Leave me alone!
Here, Vic. Want a bite?
l`ll just put it over here
and you can have it later.
Well, if that`s the way you feel,
forget it, Vic! Just forget it!
But l think
you`re really out of line.
We got a homicide on our hands.
See what you`ve got on a Faden.
Victor J. Faden.
F-A-D-E-N. Thanks.
ls there someone we should notify?
As far as l know,
there`s no immediate family.
His mother died while giving birth.
l don`t know about the father,
took off somewhere, l guess.
The kid got shuffled from home
to home until he came here.
- He was a good kid.
- l know, Matt.
So, what have we got here?
Bunch of pussies.
Come on, Roy.
Get your hands dirty.
Pete, this is bullshit!
This really sucks!
Fix it!
Those cunts aren`t gonna wait.
Oh, fuck! This is a mess.
No way, l refuse to do this.
You`re always fucking around
with this, so get up and fix it!
You understand?
- You are an asshole!
- What`s the matter, Vinny?
You all creeped-out
by that murder at the nuthouse?
As far as l`m concerned,
all those loonies should be
killed off one by one.
Can you try it now?
Jesus! Can`t you do anything?
Stop screwing around!
Get this done by the time l get back.
l gotta take a crap.
- Crap, my ass!
- Just do it, man! l mean it.
Fucking asshole!
You little fuck.
What are you doing, douchebag?
Enough, already. You can stop.
Would you cut it out?
All right, either you got the car
started or you`re a dead man.
This ain`t starting, man.
You fucked up again.
l`m gonna kick your ass,
kick your ass!
Come on everybody,
this ain`t startin`!
Come on, motherfucker,
fix the fucking car!
Come on.
You fucked up again, you asshole!
What you doing up there, Vinny?
You`re a dirty...
All right. And we`re off. Let`s go!
Die!
- Die!
- Tommy!
There you go.
- Gramps.
- What is it, son?
Can l go see my brother tomorrow?
We`ll see.
You know how l feel about that.
- But Gramps...
- l said we`ll see, Reggie.
Come here, Reggie the Reckless.
Do me a favour, don`t kiss me
when there`s people around.
OK, it`s cool. Go and let
everyone know breakfast is ready.
Breakfast! Come and get it!
l could`ve done that.
- l-l m-miss Joey already.
- So do l.
l-l hope Victor
gets what`s coming to him.
- Morning, everybody.
- Morning.
Violet, you set too many places.
l said, you set too many places.
- No, l didn`t!
- Yes, you did!
Victor and Joey won`t be here
this morning, Violet.
Or any other morning.
- Reggie!
- Oh, God. l`m sorry.
Y-you don`t s-set a place
for a dead person.
- l said l was sorry!
- What`s going on here?
Look, l know how you all feel.
This thing is not easy...
for any of us.
So let`s just have breakfast.
l`m sorry, Violet.
- Where`s Eddie?
- He`s upstairs.
Would you mind telling Eddie
to come downstairs?
Tommy? Would you mind?
Yeah, all right.
Relax, Chief. What`s wrong,
no sense of humour?
Can`t you take a joke?
lt`s all right, Tommy!
lt`s gonna be all right.
Just relax.
You`re gonna be just fine.
l`m gonna chop you into
itty-bitty little pieces, my friend.
Just like they done to that piggo
over at that fucking crazy farm.
You big dildo. Eat your fucking slop.
Ain`t l make the best
God damn stew in the world?
Best God damn stew in the world!
lt`s that God damn coyote,
trying to kill my lot again.
l`ll show that bastard
once and for all, Junior.
Holy shit! Who the fuck are you
and what the fuck do you want?
l`d like to earn a meal.
- Yeah? What do you do?
- Whatever you need done.
OK. Clean all the shit
out of the chicken coop
and dump it behind the shed.
You come back here after that
and l`ll fill your stomach.
Yes, ma`am.
That is one fucking ugly man
that goes there.
- One fucking ugly man, Mama.
- Would you shut your trap?!
You ain`t so pretty yourself,
you know.
l ain`t so pretty myself, l know.
l want every inch of this area
combed thoroughly.
- Bring back anything you find.
- Yes, sir.
- What the hell`s going on here?
- You talking to me, Sheriff?
l thought you was talking to me.
No, Roy. lt`s OK.
Go ahead. Get them out of here.
Looks like we got us a maniac
on the loose, huh, Sheriff?
Lana! Hey, Lana!
Sorry, buster. We`re closed.
lt`s OK,
l just want a take-out order.
You do? What would you like?
l`d like Lana to go with nothing on.
And who wants her?
The pride of the Unger
lnstitute of Mental Health,
who`s dumped his last bedpan
and would like very much to party.
Lana...
l don`t know, l`ll have to ask her.
Hey, Lana. You want Billy?
You sure?
She wants you, too. But you`ll
have to wait till she`s done.
There. l`m going to party.
lt`s show time!
That`s it.
That`s it. That`s the whole
fucking thing right there.
There it is.
You just stay right there, doll.
That`s just what the doctor ordered.
A little preventive medicine.
And the forecast is...
cloudy in the mountains,
sunny in the valleys,
and snow flurries up your nose.
Girl, you are so hot.
What the fuck is she doing?
Jesus Christ! Come on, will you?
You bad kitty.
l don`t like you any more.
l feed you,
and you scare me like that.
Go on, kitty.
Sorry.
Billy, what are you doing?
lt`s cold.
This is cute.
l like this. A whole lot.
You`ll waste a lot of money
this way, smartie.
Oh, well,
that just means more for me.
Yummy.
Oh, my God. Billy!
l don`t care if you have to put
your fucking mother behind bars!
Get me the God damn psycho
who`s responsible for this mess.
l mean, shit, Tucker,
what the hell`s going on here?
l mean, this is a small town, man.
And small towns
are supposed to be safe.
l know who it is.
- What?
- l said, l know who it is.
- Who?
- lt`s Jason Voorhees.
Jason Voorhees?
You`re out of your mind!
You`ve been in the sun too long.
Jason is dead! His body was cremated.
He`s nothing but a handful of ash.
You know that for sure, Mayor?
Did you see him cremated?
Jason Voorhees.
l can`t believe this!
Here, this is your
Jason Voorhees, here. This.
Your ass is on the line here,
Tucker. Are you getting that?
You get me a God damn live suspect!
- You fuck! You really scared me.
- You loved it.
- You want more?
- Eddie, we can`t.
- Matt will kill us.
- Fuck him.
- Fuck you.
- Exactly. Fuck me.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Watch the dirt. Watch the dirt.
- What?
- Wait a minute.
Especially for the occasion.
- l`ll go wash up.
- OK, sugar.
- Hurry back.
- l`m hurrying.
l`m back.
What is this? Sleeping?
- Let`s get this show on the road!
- Wait a minute, l`m coming.
l just don`t understand it.
Reggie, l want you to be
a good kid with Pam.
- She`s doing us both a great favour.
- lf she ever gets here.
Don`t go getting
into trouble with Demon.
All right! Pam! Come on!
Tina and Eddie will show up when
they get hungry, so stop worrying.
l`m not worried any more.
l`m just pissed.
Stop it.
Take Tommy with you. lt`ll probably
do him good to get away.
Yeah, that`s a good idea.
Tommy! Pam`s taking Reggie
to see his brother tonight.
- Why don`t you go too?
- Great idea. Let`s go.
Go see what you can do.
Come on. lt`ll be fun.
Good.
- Come on.
- No. l`ll wait here.
- Come on.
- l`m OK.
Yo, Demon!
- ls that the big bad wolf?
- Yeah. Open up!
- That you, Reckless?
- Open up!
Oh, my God!
Get your ass in here, boy!
God, it`s to good see you!
Damn, you look good!
l know, l know.
Oh, God. Look at this.
You had any dinner?
- Here. Have an enchilada. Man...
- Where`d you get those bad rings?
lf you`d lived as long as
your big brother, you`d get things.
Freaking ``A``! Where`d you get that?
Calm down, dude. Say hello
to Anita. She`s my girlfriend.
- Hello, beautiful.
- Hey, little brother.
l want you to meet somebody.
Hey, Pam!
Come here, baby, come here.
This is my friend Pam.
She`s my girlfriend.
What`s up, Pam?
Pam, you hungry? Want a taco?
What about a slice of pizza?
- No.
- Cheese and sausage.
What about you, brother?
You want a beer? Get out of here.
l`ll tell you what.
Why don`t you take this?
- Man, this is bad!
- Nothing`s too good for my brother.
Gonna give me this, too?
l got you, didn`t l?
Really scared you, didn`t l?
Are you dumb or something?
You`re a crazy from the loony bin!
My mama`s going to chop you up
into itty-bitty pieces, my friend!
You hear me?
l said, are you hearing me?
l said, are you hearing me?!
Fuck you, lunatic!
Reggie, we`ve got to go now.
- OK, bro. Take care.
- Thanks for the dinner.
- Anytime.
- Stay cool, baby.
- Stay safe, Reckless!
- l will!
- You know, l miss him already.
- Yeah, he`s a cutie pie.
- Want to hit this?
- Yeah.
What`s wrong?
- You OK?
- lt`s them damn enchiladas.
You gonna be all right?
Who`s that?
Stop it!
Stop it!
You`re gonna get it, bitch!
Lighten up, Demon. You`ll feel
a lot better after you shit.
l`ll feel a lot better when l`m out
of here. This shit box is gross!
Watch out for snakes.
They`ll crawl up and bite your ass.
Anita? Hey, girl, what`s up?
OK. l told you this isn`t funny.
Now you`re gonna get it, bitch.
M-Matt`s gone. G-George, too.
- Are you sure?
- l l-looked.
Tina and Eddie
haven`t come back either.
- W-where are they?
- lt`s OK. Calm down, Jake.
Let`s take this slowly.
Where did Matt say he was going?
- He didn`t.
- Yes, he did.
He went looking for Tina and Eddie.
W-where`s Tommy?
Wasn`t he with you?
- And where`s Gramps?
- l don`t know, Reggie.
Why don`t you all go inside?
l`m gonna go find everyone.
- Jake, l`m putting you in charge.
- Yes.
And you, Reckless, l want you in bed
asleep when l get back, right?
No problem.
l`m making your dinner, Junior!
You hearing me, fella?
He hurt me, Ma! They hurt me!
l am making your dinner!
They hurt me, Ma!
Will you murder `em?!
Chop `em and kill `em?!
Do you hear me?
Get off that fucking bike
and come here and eat my stew!
About time, you fuck wad.
l knew you couldn`t pass up
on my stew.
You hearing me, Junior?
You talk. You dumb?
lt`s so lonely here.
Like we were the only two people left
in the whole world.
Maybe we are. Maybe when we get back,
everybody will have disappeared.
l`d like that, wouldn`t you?
Robin,
w-we`ve b-been here
nearly eight months now, right?
T-that`s a long time
to get to know somebody.
- Jake, please.
- Sure, sure.
We could go anywhere we wanted,
and live in the biggest house
in the world.
l`d like to live in a little house,
just big enough for the two of us.
Only there`ll be
more than two of us.
l l-like you, Robin...
- A lot.
- l like you, too, Jake.
You do? A lot?
What are you talking about, Jake?
l want to be with you.
l-l r-really
do want to be with you.
l-l w-want to m-make love with you.
- l can`t...
- l-l didn`t mean it.
l...l didn`t mean it.
l-l said l...l didn`t mean it!
Vi, l-l`d l-like to talk to you.
- l n-need to talk to you!
- Can it wait?
No.
Reggie. Reggie? Come on.
Reggie, wake up.
lt`s time to go to bed.
Reggie, wake up. Reggie!
OK, your way.
Jake, l`m sorry.
You know, sometimes, Robin,
you are just so stupid.
What are them nuts up to now?
Yo, Tommy. You back?
Tommy, you in here?
What is it, Reggie? lt`s Pam.
What`s the matter? What`s the matter?
- lt`s me! What is it? What is it?!
- ln Tommy`s room!
All right. You stay here.
Relax. l`ll be right back.
Move!
Get up!
Shit!
Run! Come on! Let`s go!
Help us!
Pam, where are you?!
lt`s OK, Reggie. lt`s OK. lt`s OK.
God.
God.
Yeah! All right! Yeah!
Run, Tommy, run!
Run! He`ll kill you!
- Jason?
- Listen to me!
Run! Go! Tommy, get out!
- Jason?
- Get out!
Listen! Oh, Tommy, go!
- Tommy!
- Remember.
Don`t.
- Remember.
- Die!
Up here, Tommy! Up here! Come on!
- Tommy, please!
- Tommy, up here!
- Come on!
- Come on! Hurry up!
Tommy, hurry up!
Come on, come on!
Tommy, you can do it!
Come on, Tommy!
- Tommy, please!
- Tommy, hurry up!
Take my hand. Take my hand!
Come on, yeah!
Just one more, Tommy! Come on!
Come on, you can do it!
Please! Please,
somebody help me! Pam!
How are you doing?
Quite a kid.
We found this on Roy.
The kid who was axed
at the wood pile was Roy`s son.
God only knows why Roy kept it
hidden all these years, but he did.
Roy was a real loner.
Never talked much,
not even to the other paramedics.
l guess when
he was called to the scene,
and saw that it was his own Joey
all hacked to pieces...
We also found these.
l guess he used the Jason thing
to...cover up with.
Hi.
Oh, my God.
