Go On, Do Your
Prayers, Eddie.
Go On.
God Bless Mama And Daddy...
Mama.
Hmm ?
What'S Wrong
With Daddy Tonight ?
Nothin', Eddie.
You Mind Me,
And You Go Right
To Sleep, Ya Hear ?
Will It Be All Right ?
Should I Be Afraid ?
Tom Harley !
Open Up, Tom !  It'S Me,
Clayton Heller !  Tom !
Please Open The Door !
Oh, For God'S Sakes, Tom,
Open Up, Please !
It'S After Me, Tom !
It'S Gonna Get Me !
God In Heaven, Tom.
We Can'T Just Sit Here.
We Have To, Ellie.
This Has Nothing To Do With Us.
What Kind Of A Christian
Are You, For God'S Sakes ?
You Gotta Help Me !
- Tom !
- Mom, Look !
- See To The Boy.
- Tom, It'S Gonna Get Me
If You Don'T Open The Door !
For God'S Sake,
Please Help Me !
Oh, Tom !
Why Doesn'T Daddy
Let The Man In ?
Please Open The Door !
He Can'T, Honey.
He Just Can'T.
Get Away From My Door.
Get Away From Me
And My Family.
Tom, Please !
You Gotta Help Me, Tom.
It'S Comin'.
I Didn'T Kill That Girl.
I Don'T Know Nothin' About That,
And I Don'T Want To.
They Said I Did, Tom,
But I Didn'T.
I'M Sorry.  I Am.
But I Can'T Risk My Family
For You, Clayton.
Now I Got My Shotgun Here.
Get Away.
Get Away
Afore I Have To Use It.
Gypsy, Ready ?  Ready ?
Hey, Pick It Up.
Come Here.  Come On.
All Right, Ready ?
Go Get It.
Come On.
Well, Young Man,
Come Up Here.
Thank You.
What'Ve You Been Doin' ?
Playin' With Gypsy.
Uh-Huh.  That'S Good.
You Know Somethin' ?
When I Was Your Age,
My Great Grandmama
Used To Wash My Hands.
And She Was So Old,
That The Skin On Her Hands
Was Thin As Tissue Paper.
It Felt So Good.
Guess What ?
Last One In The House...
Will Get The Privilege
Of Washin' The Breakfast Dishes.
Get Outta Town.
Come On, Gypsy.
- Not At The Table, Billy.
- But He'S Awful Hungry, Daddy.
Put It In The Bowl.
- Is It Story Time ?
- I Reckon.
Wait.
I Gotta Get Somethin'.
- Daddy ?
- Hold On.
- I Made You A Present.
- You Did ?
I Like Presents.
Oh, Well,
Now This Is Somethin'.
It Goes Around Your Neck.
This Is Somethin' Special.
- Do You Really Like It ?
- I Love It.
You Don'T Have To Wear It
Every Day Or Nothin'.
Just When It Strikes Ya.
Give Me A Hug.
I Ain'T Never Takin' It Off.
All Right, Now, Wait A Minute.
Once Upon A Time...
There Was This Scruffy Old Man,
And You Know...
He Was One Of Them
"Yes And No" Kind Of Guys.
-
- So Anyhow,
He Was Very Proud...
'Cause He Had This Very Clever
Son, And He Knew That One Day...
This Son Was Gonna Grow Up
To Be Somethin' Very Special.
So, Then One Day--
Really, Tracy, You Know,
Joel Is A Great Guy Once
You Get To Know Him.
Honey, Get Me A Beer.
So How Much Further
Is It To The Cabin, Steve ?
Uh, About 50 Miles.
Why Do You Always Have To Carry
That Stupid Rifle With You ?
'Cause You Never Know
What You'Re Gonna Find
In The Jungle, Yo.
Oh, Sorry.
Thank You, Klutz.
Okay, Come On.
- Let 'Er Rip.
- Now ?
Get The Potatoes, Kid.
Sweet Potatoes.
Come On, Get It Over There.
Wait, Steve, Pull Over !
What ?
I Want To Take A Picture.
These People Can Get
Pretty Weird, Trace.
We Heard A Story
A Couple Years Ago
About A Guy...
Who Killed His Wife
And Ate Her Just To Get
Rid Of The Evidence.
No !
That'S Disgusting.
No, The Cops Found Like
Her Foot Or Something
In This Big Pot...
With All These
Carrots And Onions,
Like Foot Stew.
You Know, I Think
This Was The Guy Too.
This Was The Guy !
Get A Few More Of These.
Here You Go.  Get A Few
More Of Them, Boy.
All Right, Here We Are !
Where ?
Downtown Bradley Mountain.
Cabin'S The Next Stop,
Just A Few Miles From Here.
Kimbo.
Yeah ?
Help Me Out.
All Right ?
Mmm.
This Is Your Last Chance
To Shop, Lady.
These Guys Are Animals.
Civilization Is Behind Us.

Hook Shot !
No, Gypsy !

- Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.  Nice Dog.
No.  Gypsy !
Made A Friend There
Already, Huh, Joel ?
- Gypsy, No !

No More Than I Did Yesterday.
Uh, Do You Have
Any Beer, Sir ?

- Pumpkinhead Got Him.
Teared Off His Head
And Drank All The Blood.
Did Not!
Did Too !
Shut Up, Hessie !
Keep Away From Pumpkinhead
Unless You'Re Tired Of Livin'.
His Enemies Are Mostly Dead,
He'S Mean And Unforgivin'.
- Stop It !
-
-Stop It !
-Bolted Doors And Windows Blind.
Guard Dogs Prowlin'
In The Yard...
Pumpkinhead.  Pumpkinhead.
Won'T Protect You
Till You'Re Dead.
Nothing Will From Pumpkinhead.
So Keep Away From Pumpkinhead.
- Stop It !
- Stop It !

I Mean, Well, You'Ve

Pumpkinhead.
All Right.
Get In The Truck.
Come On.
- Hey !

Here You Go, Billy.
I Was Just About
To Say Something Myself.
- That'Ll Do It
For You, Mr. Wallace ?
- That And My Feed.
Oh, I Left It Up At The House.
Give Me A Couple Of Minutes.
I Ain'T Got It.
I'M Due Back Now.
Suppose I Drop It Off
Right At Your Door ?
Be There Before Dark.
Billy, Bring Gypsy Inside
Out Of The Sun For A While.
Yes, Daddy.
- Gotta Admit, He'S Pretty Good.
- He'S A Jerk.
Yeah, But He'S
A Talented Jerk.
Nah, He'S Just A Jerk Jerk.
Billy, I Want You
To Stay Right Here
And Mind Things, Okay ?
I Gotta Fetch Somethin'
Up At The House.
Yes, Sir, Daddy.
Then We'Ll Take Us
A Little Ride.
Do You Have To
Encourage Him ?
Maggie... He'S My Brother.
Be A Good Boy, Now.
- You Man Enough ?
- Go For It !
- Gypsy, No !
-
Little Boy !
Are You Okay ?
Little Boy !
Gypsy !
No !
- Jesus.

Don'T Move Him.
- He Just Came Out Of Nowhere.
Is He All Right ?
He'S Cold.
It'S Gonna Be Okay, Billy.
All Right, Keep Him Warm.
Keep Him Warm.
It'S Gonna Be Okay,
Little Boy.
Oh, God.
Hey !  Stay Here.
We Gotta Do Something.
You'Re Gonna Be Fine.
What The Hell
Do You Think You'Re Doin' ?
We Stay, I'M Fucked, Man.
Is That What You Want ?
It Was An Accident.
I Almost Hit Him Myself.
Yeah, But I'Ve Been Drinkin'.
They'Ll Fry Me.
You Gotta Help Me, Scratch.
Call An Ambulance.
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
Hurry !
What Are You Doing ?
What Are You Doing ?

Hey !  Joel, Get Back Here !
Where The Fuck Is He Going ?
Forget Joel.
Forget--  Oh, Fuck !
It'S Gonna Be Fine.
Everything'S Gonna Be Okay.
Hey, Come On.

No Phone.
What About That Guy
At The Stand ?
He'S Gone, He'S Gone,
He'S Gone !
Oh, God.

There'S A Phone Over There.
It'S All Right.
Chris !

But Can I Help ?
Okay, Maggie, Come On.
Come On, Maggie.
Maggie, Come On !
Listen.  Just Get Up To That
Cabin And Get On The Phone.
I Just Stay
On This Trail ?

Did You Call For Help ?
Oh, Jesus.
This Is Crazy.
Damn You !
- He Just Ripped The Phone
Cord Out Of The Wall !
- What ?
I'M Gonna Drive
To The Nearest Town.
You'Re Not Goin'
Anywhere.
Hey !
Hey !  What'S Up, Man ?
Chris, Please.
Joel Was In Another Accident
A Couple Of Months Ago.
A Girl Was Hurt.
He'S On Probation Right Now.
If The Police Find Out--
They'Re Not Gonna
Find Out About It !
Look, Man, I'M
Real Sorry About That,
But That Little Boy Down There
Needs Our Help Now !
Joel...
Just Give Me The Keys,
All Right ?
-
- You Okay ?
- Yeah.  Go.
- He Wouldn'T Stop.
It'S Gonna Be Okay.
It'S Gonna Be Okay.
Once Upon A Time...
There Was This Old Man,
And He Had A Very,
Very Special Son.
Daddy.
Yeah, Baby ?
- Are You Okay ?
- Steve !  Steve !
Hey, Steve, Let Us Out !
We'Re In Here !
- I Just Don'T Believe This !
- I'M Not Going To Jail.
Come On, Steve !
Damn It !
The Kid'S Father Showed Up.
He Took The Kid Away.
I Think Everything'S
Gonna Be Okay.
Really ?
- You Tell Him What Happened ?
- I Told Him It Was An Accident.
- And ?
- And He Just Looked At Me.
- What Do You Mean,
He Just Looked At You ?
- I Don'T Know.
Don'T Lie To Me !
He Looked At Me
Like He Wanted To Kill Me.
Get Over There--
- Lookin' For Your Pa.
- Hey, Bunt !
Sir ?
Fetch Your Grandpa.
Okay.
Grandpa, Pa Wants You.
Mr. Harley'S Outside
With The Feed.
You Go On Out
And Unload The Feed.
Well, Here'S
What I Owe Ya.
Keep It If You Can Help Me.
I'M Lookin' For An Old Woman.
She Lives Somewhere
In The Mountains Hereabouts.
Some Folks Say As How
She'S Got Powers.
I Never Heard
Of No Such Woman.
Mr. Wallace... Please.
I Can'T Tell Ya
What I Don'T Know.
- Bunt.
- Sir ?
- Get Over To The House.
- You Told Me To Do This First.
You Do What I Told You, Boy,
And You Do It Now.
Okay.
What Killed Him ?
City Folks Run Him Over.
- Left Him.
- I'M Sorry About Your Boy.
You Got To Tell Me.
She'S The Only One
That Can Help Him.
Like I Said, I'M Sorry.
You Got To Tell Me,
Goddamn It !
She Can'T Help Him.
All She Can Do Is Take You
Straight To Hell.
Now, You Go On Home.
You Go Home And You Bury
Your Boy.
Hold It !
Mr. Harley, I Heard You
Talkin' To My Grandpa.
I Know Who You'Re
Lookin' For.
What'S Your Trade ?
What ?
Her Name'S Haggis.
She'S Up On Black Ridge.
Get In Back.
Uh-Uh.  No Way.
You Got To Show Me.
Get In Back.
Okay, But I'M Only
Going Part Way.
That Old Woman Scares
The Piss Out Of Me.
Stop, Ed !
Stop The Truck !  Stop !
This Is As Far As I Go.
You Keep On Straight.
Follow This Road
Till You Can'T No More.
You Come To A Cabin,
That'S Her.
Who Are You ?
Uh... Ed Harley.  I--
'Fraid Raisin' The Dead
Ain'T Within My Power.
This Is--
This Is All I Got.
This Is Everything.
Nothin' I Can Do For Him.
When I Was Young--
I Said, There'S
Nothin' I Can Do.
I Saw It.
What ?
What Do You Want,
Ed Harley ?
Say It.
Say It !  Say It !
When I Was Young,
Folks Used To Talk About You.
Said As How You Knew Things.
Said If A Man Had Been Wronged,
He Could Come To You.
You Called Upon This Thing...
In That Man'S Name,
And That Man,
He'D Be Avenged.
What You'Re Askin'...
Got A Powerful Price.
They Killed My Boy.
They Run Him Over,
And They Left Him.
Ever Hear
Of Razorback Holler ?
Way Back Deep In Them Woods.
Mountain Folk
Used To Bury Kin In There,
Kin They'S Ashamed Of.
Bring A Shovel.
The Thing You'Re Lookin' For
Is In There.
Bring It Back Here.
Some Things I Gotta Do To It
'Fore It'Ll Be Any Use To Ya.
That Graveyard--
How Will I Know--
You'Ll Know, Ed Harley.
You'Ll Know.
Leave The Boy.
God.
When We Get Out Of Here,
Joel'S Gonna Be Carrying
His Balls Home In A Knapsack.
Remind Me Never
To Piss You Off, Tracy.
I'Ll Tell Them
It Was My Fault,
That It Was My Bike
That Hit Him.
The Worst
They'Re Gonna Give Me
Is A Slap On The Wrist.
No.
Um... Look,
I'M Really Starting
To Worry About Maggie.
Bring It Here.
What Is It ?
It'S What You Wanted,
Ed Harley.
For Each Of Man'S Evils,
A Special Demon Exists.
You'Re Lookin'
At Vengeance--
Cruel, Devious,
Pure-As-Venom Vengeance.
Give Me Your Hand.
Oh, God.
You Can Go Now, Ed Harley.
Now It Begins.
-
- What'D You Do, Daddy ?
Well, Fuck It.
Let'S Just Kidnap Chris
And Tracy And Go To Mexico.
Oh, Guys.
You Gotta Do The Right Thing,
And You Gotta Do It Now.
They Killed Our Boy, Lynn Honey.
Now They'Re Gonna Pay.
Maggie.
Here.  Look.
Look, Maggie.
Look At It.
You Always Found
Your Strength From This.
Well, Find It Now
And Come Back.
I Need You.
Steve.  Steve.
Yeah.
It'S Okay.  I'M Sure
The Boy'S Gonna Be Fine.
I'M Sure His Father'S
Taking Care Of Him.
Steve !  No !
-
-
Help !  Steve !
I'M Always Fucking Up.
My Whole Life,
One Big Fuck-Up.
But It Stops Now.
- Help Me !  Help Me !
- Maggie, What Happened ?
It'S Killing Him !
Lock The Door.
Steve !
If Those Scum Hurt
My Brother, I'Ll Rip Their
Fucking Hearts Out.  Steve !
Hail Mary, Full Of Grace,
The Lord Is With Thee--
Whatever You Saw Out There,
It Wasn'T The Devil.
It Was !
There Is
No Such Thing.
There Is !  I Saw It !
Oh, Man, Be Okay, Steve.
Be Okay !
We'Re Gonna Find Him, Man.
They Should Be Okay, Right ?
I Mean, They Took The Gun
And Everything.
God Is The Only Thing That
Can Stop What'S Out There, Kim.
Just In Case
God Doesn'T Show.
Oh, God, Steve.
Cabin, Man !  Come On !
-
- Oh, Jesus.
You All Right ?
There Was Something
At The Window.
- What About Steve ?
- We Couldn'T Find Him.
- What Are We Gonna Do ?
- I Don'T Know.
- We'Ve Gotta Get Out Of Here !
- We'Re Not Going Anywhere
Without Steve.
Maggie, We Don'T Know
What'S Out There !
Steve Is Out There !
- She'S Right.  Now, Come On.
We'Re Gonna Find Him.
- Maggie, Wait !
Here, Help Me !
Maggie !
Tracy !
Maggie !  Maggie !
Goddamn It !
Tracy !  Wait !
Maggie !  Maggie !
Did You See Something ?
I Saw Something.
I Don'T Know--
Just Stay Close, Okay ?
It'Ll Pass, Ed Harley.
Let It Finish.
No, You Gotta Stop It.
It'S What You Wanted.
No !  Not Like This !
Not Like This !
I See It.
This Is Wrong.
Nothin' I Can Do.
It'S Gotta
Run Its Course Now.
What Did You Think ?
It'D Be Easy,
Neat And Clean
And Painless ?
If You Won'T Help Me,
If You Don'T Help Me,
Then I'Ll Do It Myself.
I'Ll Do It,
I'Ll Do It Myself.
You'Ll Fail, Ed Harley.
You'Ll Fail And You'Ll Die Too.
Then I'Ll Die !
Then I'Ll Die !
And Pay The Final Price
All The Sooner.
Goddamn You !
Goddamn You !
He Already Has, Son.
He Already Has.
Maggie !
Oh !
No !  No !
I'M The One You Want !
No !  No--
No !
Oh, My God, Joel !
What'S Wrong ?
It'S Got Kim.
What'S Got Her ?
It'S A Thing.
What Thing, Man ?
I Don'T Know !
It'S A Thing !
Kim !  Kim !  Kim !
Come On, Man.  Come On, Man.
Tracy, Come On !
Kim !  Kim !
Joel !
Oh, My God.
- No.
- No !
No !
Joel, Come On.
We Gotta Move, Man !
Come On !
Help Us !
Hello ?
Why Is This
Happening ?
I Don'T Know !
We Gotta Move.
Let'S Go.
Help !
Somebody Help Us !
Help !
Help Us !
Anybody In There, Please ?
There'S Something After Us.
Please !
- Where'S Steve At ?
- Please !
Don'T Be Mad.
I'M Cold.
Come On.
Steve'S Dead.
Come On, Man.
Come On.
Tracy.
Oh, Shit.
It'S Locked !
Okay, Just Get Back.
Empty Your Hands, Son.
Get Away From Here.
Go On !  Git.
Look, Mister.
We Got Something
Chasin' Us.  We Just Wanna
Use Your Truck.  Okay ?
Please.
Git Off My Land.
Don'T Make Me
Have To Shoot You.
Please !
We Just Need Your Help.
I Can'T Help You.
You Folks Is Marked.
Marked ?
What Do You Mean, Marked ?
Joel.  Joel, No !
You Don'T Know If It'S Dead !
It'S Dead.
-
-
- Joel !
-
Oh !
Hey.  Come On.
Come On.
What Is It ?
I Don'T Know !
But Whatever It Is, It'S Not
Gonna Get Us.  Do You Hear Me ?
It'S Not Gonna Get Us !
There Must Be Somebody
That Can Help Us !
Come On !
Bunt, Get Away
From That Window.
Grandpa, You Sure That Thing
Ain'T Gonna Hurt The Animals ?
It Only Kills What It
Was Called Upon To Kill.
Them, And Whatever
Gets In Its Way.
Our Animals
Will Be Fine.
You Get Away From That Window,
And You Get To Bed.
-
- Help !  Help Us !
Get To Bed Like I Told You.
Now.
For God'S Sake, Please.
Help Us !  Come On, Man !
Let Us In.
Damn !
Bunt ?
Go Back To Sleep, Hessie.
What You Doin' ?
Nothin'.
Okay.
If I Tell You, You Gotta Promise
Not To Tell Nobody.  Not A Soul.
I Won'T.
Cross Your Heart.
Now Swear.
I Swear.
Spit.
I'M Gonna Help Those Folks,
Hessie.  I Got To Find Out
If It'S Real Or Just A Story.
Grandpa Will Whip You Good
If He Finds Out.
He Ain'T Gonna Find Out.
Be Careful.
Of Course
I'M Gonna Be Careful.
Shh.  Come On.
It'S You.
Did You Get A Look At It ?
What'S It Look Like ?
Is It Big ?
Who Are You ?
Man, What'S Goin' On ?
I'M Tryin' To Help You,
For Christ'S Sake !
My Name'S Bunt.
I Live In This House Here.
How Come Nobody
Answered The Door ?
Didn'T They Hear Us ?
They Can Hear You.
They Ain'T Allowed To Help.
They Ain'T
Allowed To Let You In.
They Can'T Get Involved.
What Do You Mean, Man ?
A Man Back There
Said We Were Marked.
We Can'T Talk About This Here.
Come On.  I Know A Place
That Might Be Safe.
Come On.
I Know Where We Can Go.
Come On.  Come On.
Ain'T It Neat ?
About 40 Years Ago They Tried
To Start A Congregation
Around Here.
I Didn'T Work Out,
I Guess.
I Figure It'S A Holy Place,
So It Might Not Like It Here.
Come On.
Come On.
Watch Out.
Bunt.  What Do You Know
About That Thing
That'S After Us ?
It'S Some Kind Of Demon.
Before Tonight
I Didn'T Believe It.
I Thought It Was Just
Somethin' That They Made Up
To Scare The Little Kids.
But When The Sun Went Down,
My Grandpa Fetched The Whole
Family Together.
And He Told Us
That Some Outsider Folks
Had Done Somethin' Real Bad.
He Wouldn'T Say What.
He Just Said...
That Pumpkinhead Was Gonna
Be Out After 'Em...
And That We Better Stay
Inside Till He Got 'Em.
- Pumpkinhead ?
- That'S What It'S Called.
'Cause It Comes From
The Old Pumpkin Patch
Graveyard.
- Do You Know Why
It'S After Us ?
- No, Ma'Am.
But You Must Have Done
Something Bad.
According To The Legend,
If One Man Does Something Bad
To Another Man--
It'S Gotta Be Something Real
Bad, Somethin' Like Killin'--
Then That Other Man Can Have
Pumpkinhead Conjured Up
To Take Revenge.
The Kid At The Stand.
What ?  What ?
There Was An Accident
Earlier.
One Of Our Friends Hit
A Little Boy With A Motorcycle.
Where ?
At The Fruit Stand A Couple
Of Miles Down The Road.
Gosh Almighty.
Billy Harley.
You Know ?
You Heard About It ?
I Took His--
I Saw His Pa, Mr. Harley,
This Afternoon.
I Took Him Somewhere.
Well, Was His Son Okay ?
I Can'T Say
For Sure.
But If That Thing'S
Huntin' You, I Suppose Not.
Oh, My God.
- Your Friends,
Where Are They Now ?
- They'Re Dead.
Do You Know The Spot
On Bradley Mountain
Where People Park Their Cars ?
- Yes.
- Can You Take Us There ?
Uh-Huh.
I Think It'S Here Now.
-
- Go !
Go On !  Move It !
Wallace !  Wallace !
Open Up !
Wallace, Open Up.
Wallace !
We Gotta Stop It !
We Gotta Stop It,
Or It'S Gonna Kill 'Em All !
Open Up Or I'Ll Blow The
Goddamn Thing Off The Hinges.
Lose It, Harley.
You Get Away From Here.
Get Away From Me
And My Kin.
This Way.
-
Stay Here.
-   No.
Stay Here !
Chris !
Chris.
Chris.
Come On.  Please.
Lady, You Gotta Get Up.
We Gotta Go.
Please.  We Can'T Stop It.
No One Can.
Somebody Can.
Mr. Harley.
Come With Me.
Mr. Harley, It'S Pumpkinhead.
It'S Real.
Now.
Come On.
Get In.
Get In The House.
Do You Wanna Live ?
You Okay ?
Yeah.
Thanks To You.
Well.
I'M Gonna Go Outside
And Talk To Mr. Harley.
I Want You To Stay Here.
Mr. Harley ?
Mr. Harley.
It Was An Accident.
He'S Dead.
Nobody Saw Him
Until It Was Too Late.
Can'T You Stop This ?
Can'T You Call It Off ?
Nothin' Can Call It Off.
But I'M Gonna Send It Back
To Whatever Hell It Come From.
Oh.
Oh, You Old Dog.
Mr. Harley ?
Mr. Harley,
Are You Okay ?
Chris.

Kill Me.
