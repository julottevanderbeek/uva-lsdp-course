I hate this place.
Oh, water?
Water.
Water.
Water.
Huh?
Unh! Uhh!
Aaaaah!
Aah! Aaah!
Uhh! Aaah!
Aah! Uhh!
Aaaaaaaah!
Man: Now that is sick.
Ohh! Are you watching this?
Second man: No, thanks.
I don't look anymore.
We've seen a lot,
but this is just...
Oh, dear god.
Wow!
You know, you
shouldn't be looking
at the files.
Well, it's not
against the rules.
But it's not
encouraged.
Come on, man.
We've all--
It's not encouraged.
Ok.
Ok, screw this.
Pawn to King 2.
Knight to Queen's
Bishop 6.
Check.
What?
I didn't even
see that.
You know, I was--
I was just wondering...
Um... when is
Chickliss coming back?
Sometime this week.
Probably all suntanned,
the prick.
Let's see...
King to King's
Bishop 8.
Rook takes Queen.
Check.
Damn it.
Damn.
Sorry.
Shut up. I don't
need your sympathy.
And Owen?
Where's Owen?
Are you trying to
psyche me out or what?
I can-- I can't hear
myself think.
Owen is...
Owen is probably
out sick again.
That would be
my best guess.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Yes.
Despite your rather
transparent tactics,
Brainman,
prepare to die.
Bishop to Queen's
Knight 7.
Queen takes Bishop.
I believe that's
What? No way.
Aw, come on.
How did you--
You freak
of nature!
You know, the other night,
I heard some noise.
Noise?
Yeah.
In Owen's room,
like a...
Like a scuffle.
Really?
Yeah. You don't
think that--
You dreamt it.
No, look--
You dreamt it.
You always complain
about your nightmares.
They come
for you at night.
What?
They come for you
at night.
Who does?
They do.
Drop it.
They do.
Enough!
What are you,
suicidal?
Ah, good.
They didn't forget
lunch this time.
Goat-cheese Salad
with Ginseng,
Liver Fricassee,
and Mango Sorbet.
Ew...
Must be you.
Steak Frites.
That's me.
Hey.
What?
Oh. Sorry.
Bless us, our lord,
for these, thy gifts,
which we are about to
receive from thy bounty.
Through you,
our lord, amen.
Amen.
Down the hatch.
"Please record R.E.M. sleeper
in room 172409."
Let's go.
Ok. Zooming out
of 06-12-21
and zooming in
to 1724-niner.
Good.
Here we go.
Hot-patching
gear works
and flipping to
R.E.M. reader mode.
Locating subject.
Subject located.
Zooming in.
Wow.
Keep your tongue in
your mouth, Brainman.
We're on the clock.
Are we locked?
Sorry. Locked on.
Thank you.
Arm extension... go.
Calibrating.
Steady.
I got it.
I got it.
Light her up.
Interscan
is locked.
Commencing
R.E.M. read.
Mommy!
Mommy, help!
Anna!
Unh!
Anna!
Unh!
Uhh!
Ok. Now let's...
cycle back.
And there you have it.
You do this
long enough,
you could do it
in your sleep.
Ha ha ha.
In  your  sleep.
Recording dreams
in your sleep.
That's funny.
When's the last time
you remember being outside?
Uh... last night.
I had a dream
about being
at the beach.
No, no. I mean
really outside,
not a dream.
I don't remember.
I've been busy
lately.
Overloaded actually,
picking up slack...
for you,
I might add.
I don't remember,
either.
Isn't that weird?
You're weird.
Shut up and let me
concentrate.
Damn it.
You know, I was
just thinking--
Stop thinking.
What's gotten into you?
What's gotten
into me?
You know
who these are?
Chickliss' kids--
Arthur and Sunshine.
Orphans.
They're orphans.
You told me Chickliss
was on vacation.
I have to go
to the can.
Try not to drool
on the controls.
Screws up
the calibration.
Bastards.
Where is she?
What have you done
with her?
Where's...
Girl's voice: Mom!
What have you
done to me?
Why can't I remember?
Why can't I remember
my daughter's name?
Hey.
Let me go!
Get off me!
Ok, ok. Sorry.
It's ok.
She's one of us.
Touch me again,
soldier,
and you'll be eating
your eyeballs.
Why "soldier"?
What do you know about me?
Tattoo on
your forehead.
You're in the squads,
right, Killer?
You show up by night,
and people disappear.
Why did you
do that?
Because
you're scum.
Look, miss...
you have us
at a disadvantage here.
None of us remembers
how we got here...
or pretty much
anything else.
Including who we are.
So whatever you think
you know about me...
I don't even
know myself.
I don't trust her.
She knows something.
Thank god
somebody does.
Have you seen
any children?
A little girl?
No.
My god. I hope they
don't put kids in here.
That would be
horrible.
Why do you think
there would be
children in here?
I've got to
keep moving.
Wait. You've
got to be careful
climbing around here.
Why?
There are traps.
Traps?
How do you know?
Because of this.
That's
a good bandage.
You a doctor?
I don't know.
I did it.
I might be
friggin' Mother Teresa
for all I know,
but I don't remember.
You remember
something...
before
all of this.
Not much.
Being chased
through the woods
by guys like you.
Tattoo set me off.
When I first
woke up,
I don't think I would've
known my own name
if it wasn't
stitched on my shirt.
I don't even know
if this is my name.
I feel like we've
been here for hours,
and I still can't
remember anything!
Hey, hey, hey.
Give her a moment.
Fine. A moment.
But we've got to
get moving
while we still
have our strength.
You guys
have a plan?
We keep moving
in the same direction
till we find the edge.
This place has
got to end eventually.
Well, what about
the traps?
We test the rooms.
We have a system.
Safe.
I'm going in.
Huh?
Help.
Help!
What kind of animals
would do this?
Does she look
familiar to you?
I keep thinking
I've seen her before.
Wonder what
she's in for?
You're making
a mistake.
Huh?
What's
the first rule
I taught you
about this job?
Uh... neatness counts.
Very funny.
Don't get involved.
I know. I'm not
getting involved, ok?
I'm drawing.
You have your chess.
Owen has his fish.
Chickliss has his--
Could we spend
5 minutes
without bringing up
Owen and Chickliss,
Please?
And get us back
on real time.
Gonna get us
in trouble.
I'll show you 3 ways
to beat that game,
but if you answer
one question.
Fine. What?
Ok. See, what
I want to know is--
Hold it.
Show me.
Ok.
Whew.
Checkmate.
You win.
That's brilliant.
Do that again.
What do you know
about a third exit?
What?
A third exit,
an auxiliary exit
that leads
directly outside.
There's
no such thing.
Owen said there was.
He said Chickliss
found some old plans--
They were
having you on.
No way. Actually...
I think that's
why they're gone.
I think they found
something out and--
I think you better
stop listening
to old wives' tales.
Just listen to me.
This conversation
is over.
Don't you
ever worry?
About what?
One day, you're
gonna wake up inside.
The only way I'm
gonna wake up inside
is if I keep on
talking to you.
No--
These things
are useless!
The sensors in that room
must have been different.
Maybe they're not
motion sensors.
Maybe they're triggered
by heat or sound
or something.
Why don't you
just admit it?
We're dead!
He can't admit it.
It's the training.
The Army never
admits defeat.
You got a problem
with me, lady?
Yeah.
Why?
I don't trust you.
Man: Aw, how the hell
did we miss this?
What is it?
"C.I.A."
What is that?
A clue as to who
built this place?
I think that's
just a coincidence.
Try the other doors.
"Y.Y.O."
"U.D.S."
"S.A.N."
What do they mean?
I really think
it's a mistake
to think of these letters
as meaning something.
It's like some kind
of code or puzzle
we have to
figure out.
A puzzle?
They're playing with us.
We should make
a map.
Using what?
Our blood?
I don't know, maybe.
You got a better idea?
I have a better idea.
I need something.
I need...
You have a hairpin.
They did us the favor
of polishing our boots.
Ok. We'll flag
the safe rooms.
"C.I.A."
Give me
the others.
"Y.Y.O., U.D.S.,"
and "S.A.N."
Good memory.
Yeah, in the short term.
Now I wish I could remember
what happened to me
between birth
and about 3 hours ago.
Ha ha. Right.
I don't know.
Shoe polish
and a hairpin.
Nothing in this place
is random.
Maybe the bastards
just underestimated us.
So near and yet so far.
Yeah, but she's doing
better than most.
I mean, half of them
don't even notice
the letters,
let alone map them.
I meant the chess.
Give it up.
She doesn't stand a chance.
Of course
she has a chance.
Ha ha. Yeah?
You gonna ride in
on your white horse
and whisk her out?
The rooms could realign
to zero position.
Ha.
No, it happens.
And then she'll
figure out the letters
and sail through.
And what's
the first thing
the program does
when the rooms
realign to
zero position?
A clean sweep.
Exactly.
Poof.
The only thing
that's gonna sail
through that
is her ashes.
Ha ha. Hey.
Cheer up, buddy.
They'll catch you
another one.
The boys upstairs
like them young
and pretty.
Don't you
ever feel guilty?
Don't you ever feel?
Son, you're
out of line.
Yeah, whatever.
Excuse me?
Why don't you
stop your doodling
and do some work
for a change?
Like what?
We're waiting for orders.
It's what we do best.
It's what we do.
Clean up your space.
It's disgraceful.
You're kidding,
right?
Do I look like
I'm kidding?
This one's "S.D.F."
Wait. Wait a minute.
What?
I don't know if this
makes any difference,
but they're not periods.
They're commas.
He's right.
They're commas.
Ok, so they're
commas.
What difference
does it make?
We don't even know
what the letters mean yet.
I mean, if they
were numbers,
I'd understand
the commas.
Haskell: Understand
the commas how?
Well, isn't that
how you plot
coordinates
on a graph--
X coordinate comma
y coordinate comma
z coordinate?
Right. So if the rooms
were labeled with numbers,
like 10, 1, 7...
you would know
something
about the room's
position.
Yeah, but we've
got letters
that so far tell us
absolutely nothing.
That is where you're
wrong, soldier.
The letters tell us
one important fact
that numbers
never would.
What fact?
Oh. There are only 26 letters
in the english alphabet.
So?
So we know
the parameters.
Exactly.
If each room
has its own unique
letter combination,
then it's
a pretty good bet
that this whole
place is a cube
with 26 rooms
on each side.
Worst-case scenario--
we're anywhere
from one to 25 rooms
away from the edge.
Let's go.
Great. Actually,
it's your turn
to go first.
"S, O, S."
No kidding.
Uh... I guess
we'll try another way.
Rains,  Rains,  Rains,
Rains, Rains, Rains,
Rains, Rains, Rains.
Cassandra.
The little girl's
name is Anna.
Protests and strikes.
Troublemakers up north.
The whole country's
going to crap.
Ungrateful pigs.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
What is it now?
Please tell me
that's not a--
Would you
put that away?
There's
no consent form.
What?
There's no pink page.
The consent form's missing!
So?
So? You know the rules.
She can't be in there
without a consent form.
You think
they're gonna stop
this whole operation
because you lost
a piece of paper?
I didn't lose it!
Look, you know
how anal these guys are.
Maybe she'll get
another hearing.
Listen to yourself.
No, but this could be
huge-- a mistrial.
Oh, sure.
Anything you say.
Look--
Hey!
See? I told you
I recognized her.
Hmm. She's
a political.
So that would
explain it.
What do you mean?
I mean...
there might not be
a consent form.
Get it?
But that's illegal.
You know,
for a child prodigy,
you ain't
too bright.
We've got to
do something.
Like what?
We've got to let them
know upstairs.
And how are we
gonna do that?
Call up.
It's just
for emergencies.
Well, what do you
think this is?
I don't see
a fire.
I don't see a gas leak
or flooding.
I don't see you
writhing on the floor
in the throes
of a heart attack,
but, god knows,
right now I'd like to!
She's gonna die
in there,
and she's
probably innocent!
Hey, none of them
are innocent.
You read the files.
You know what kind of
people end up in there.
Exactly! All we know
is what we read
in the... files.
Oh, my god.
What if it's
all bogus?
The files, the crimes,
everything.
Maybe they're
just putting
anyone in there
they don't like.
There's a purpose,
and there's a plan.
And I'm not so stupid
as to think there's no plan
just because
I don't understand it!
Here's a news flash.
We're just the button men.
If we were meant
to be analysts,
we'd be working
upstairs.
Would you forget
the party line for once
and make the call?
Ok.
You do it.
You're the hero.
Just remember--
she was
in the news,
and they made
her disappear.
How much easier
would it be
to get to you?
No one even
knows you exist.
Who knows where
you'll wake up
tomorrow?
Hello.
It's for you.
Yeah?
Sir.
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
Yes, sir.
I understand, sir.
Yes, sir.
We got work to do.
Someone's
at the exit.
Our exit?
Uh, what do
we do?
The exit procedure.
Whoa. Wait a minute.
I've never done
this before.
Don't you usually
do this with Owen?
That's right,
my friend.
But Owen's
not here, is he?
And the rules
clearly state
that 2 senior
technicians
have to be present
at all exit
procedures.
Right, but I am not
a senior technician.
Hey, I need help here.
That was a phone call
from upstairs--
Personal contact, direct
orders from above.
They never do that.
We can't screw this up.
Uh... we?
Yes, we.
As far as I
understand... sir,
only senior techs
are allowed
to perform
the exit procedure.
Perhaps it would be
in my best interest
to abstain until receiving
clearance from...
higher up.
You little prick.
Ok.
Ok, I get it.
Look, you help
me with this,
I'll tell them about
your girlfriend. Ok?
When?
What?
When will you
let them know?
As soon as we're
done with this.
All right?
Ok.
What do I do?
Just follow my lead.
Ok, here we go.
"Step one-- Visual
confirmation of subject
in exit room."
Uhh! Unh! Uhh!
Oh, no. Owen.
It's Owen.
Shut up.
Uhh!
Unh!
Aah!
Hello.
Hello!
Hello.
Aaaaaah!
Aah! Aah!
Aaaah!
Aaaah!
Hello.
Anyone there?
Hello.
What now?
Shh!
Please! Aah!
"Question one--
Please state your name."
Huh? Who are you?
He doesn't recognize
your voice.
Owen: Who are you people?
They fried
his brain.
Please state
your name.
They fried his brain
like the rest.
Shut... up.
Owen.
I think it's Owen.
Thank you.
Please...
"Question 2--
Do you believe
in god?"
What?
What?
Question 2-- Do you
believe in god?
What is this?
Screw you!
Please answer
yes or no.
What kind of god
would do this to people?
Please answer
yes or no.
No. Ok?
No!
Now let me go.
Let me go!
Goddamn it!
Let me out of here!
Hit it.
I need a doctor!
What does it do?
Just hit it.
Please!
For christ's sake!
Still want
your girlfriend
to sail through
to the exit?
He...
He's gone. It's over.
He was one of us.
No. Once inside,
he's one of them.
So this is your big
exit procedure?
What are
we doing here?
"Do you believe
in god?"
It all hinges
on that?!
I just read
the questions
and push
the buttons, ok?
What happens
if you push yes?
I don't know.
No one's ever
said yes.
Here.
Send this
upstairs.
Do it.
Do you believe
in god?
What kind of animals
would do this?
Owen is...
Owen is probably
out sick again.
- You sure?
- Yes.
What are you doing?
You're not
allowed in there.
I'm through pushing buttons.
No!
Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid!
I'm inside.
Ok.
Oh. Thank god.
You stupid jackass.
Good evening,
Mr. Dodd.
I believe these
belong to you.
Well, it looks
as though
you've got yourself
a little bit
of a situation
down here.
May we?
The boys upstairs felt
you could perhaps use a hand,
and so here we are.
My name is Jax,
and these are
my associates
Mr. Finn and Mr. Quigley.
Right.
Gentlemen,
first things first.
We locate our mouse.
He has no implant,
and so we shall
have to do this
the old-fashioned way,
I'm afraid.
Mr. Quigley, run a visual check
on all rooms.
He couldn't have gone far.
Yes, sir.
Thank you. Mr. Finn,
run a probability tree
on his potential
movements.
Let's have some
contingencies, shall we?
Right away, sir.
Excuse me,
Mr. Jax, sir.
Uh, excuse me, sir.
Yes, Mr. Cod?
Uh... it's Dodd, sir.
Oh.
What...
What do I do?
I'm sorry? You?
Yes.
I almost forgot.
I have your orders
from upstairs.
It's a personal
delivery. Ha ha.
Ha.
"Order number 793..."
blah blah blah blah.
"Commence standard
series of needle tests
on Rains group."
You do know
what that means?
Yes, sir.
Of course, sir.
All in a day's work, sir.
Right away, sir.
Do us a teensy favor
and use Mr. Wynn's
auxiliary monitor.
We'll need
the big guns here
for our little
mouse hunt.
Of course, sir.
Anything I can do
to help, sir.
That's the spirit,
Mr. Mod.
Way to keep the world
safe for democracy.
Have we got
a visual yet?
Quigley: Still working
on it, sir.
Ok. "K, G, K."
that's 3 odds.
"M, A, Q."
also 3 odds.
Safe.
Like taking candy
from a baby.
"A, Z, Z."
"A, Z, Z."
Rains: Got it.
Oh. I don't know why we bother
with these things anymore.
"A, Z, Z."
Hmm. That's the first time
I've seen a "Z."
Do you think
it means anything?
I don't know.
Ah, don't
let the door--
Damn it!
She's gone.
Ok. Subject
is isolated.
Now the tricky part.
Unh!
Uhh!
Unh! Uhh!
Uhh uhh uhh.
Ok. They were
last seen here...
less than an hour ago.
So she should still be
in the same quadrant.
The rooms move.
I mean, they have to.
She can't be that far.
Yeah, but if we veer
too far off course
looking for her,
we'll never
find the edge.
Ok. Well, what do you
suggest, killer?
We cut our losses?
Uh... guys.
Are we sure
this room is safe?
Maybe he just
starved to death.
God, I'm hungry.
What are you doing?
We could use these.
We have to
keep moving.
We have to get
back on track.
We've already
chased our tails
for an hour
looking for her.
God, this headache
is not going away.
Maybe it's the chip
in your head.
What?
Well, it's true,
isn't it?
I mean, they now put
bio-receivers
in all you army boys.
Keeps you on a leash.
Lady, you've got a hell
of an imagination.
Jackpot. It's her.
Hmm.
Damn it.
Is she all right?
Uh... she's
not moving.
Great.
Hey.
Hey, wake up.
Are you all right?
Rise and shine.
Is she...
There's a pulse.
She's burning up.
Can you hear me?
Oh, my god.
What happened
to you?
I don't...
feel so good.
I need a doctor.
Don't let her
touch you!
Aah! Oh, my god!
Don't leave me.
Let go!
You...
You just...
I... I didn't
mean to.
She scratched,
and I just...
Haskell: You put her
out of her misery.
My headache's gone.
Something was
eating away at her--
A chemical
or a virus.
We never checked
this room for traps.
It could be
in the air.
Let's see your arm.
We've got to get
out of here.
Show me your arm.
He's right. We've got
to get out of here.
Your arm,
where she scratched you.
Let's see it.
- Why? You think--
- Yes, I think.
Fine! There!
See? Nothing!
A flesh wound.
Aah!
Sure.
Nothing.
What do we do
with him?
What do you mean?
I think whatever was
eating away at her
is spreading to him.
Hey. Hello.
I'm still here.
Not for long.
I say
we ditch him.
Screw you!
Ok, just relax, guys.
Nobody's ditching anyone.
Look at him.
Oh, my god.
What?
It's your face.
Crap.
Please
don't leave me.
This is horrible.
You want to
baby-sit a dead man,
be my guest.
Please.
I'll do anything.
Anything?
From now on,
you test
the rooms...
all of them.
Fine.
Oh. Well, we're not
going down there.
No sense wasting
a good boot. Ok.
Get off him!
Aah!
Ohh!
Unh! Uhh!
Help me.
He's still alive
down there.
Forget it.
He's gone.
You heartless
son of a bitch!
Ohh. Oh.
No!
Don't come near me.
I was protecting us.
You murdered him.
He was infected.
You saw it.
It was spreading.
We'd be dead
by now.
You don't know that.
Wynn: Uh, actually,
he's right.
It's a highly contagious form
of necrotizing fasciitis--
A flesh-eating disease.
Who the hell
are you?
I...
I've come to help you.
Damn.
Problem, Mr. Scrod?
No problem, sir.
Anything
of interest?
Well, actually, sir,
I was about to--
Would you care to share
with the rest of the class?
Yes, sir.
As I was running
my test series,
as instructed, sir,
the quarry
intersected with
my subjects, sir.
Good work, Rod.
Who says
they only hire
the mentally challenged
down here? Open.
Thank you, sir.
Up on the main monitor
now, please.
Wynn: We collect--
I mean,  collect data
and run tests,
all kinds of tests--
Testing chemical
and biological agents,
measuring brain activity,
endurance.
Most of it
I don't understand.
And that's just what I see
in my... department.
I hear about others
who do different work.
I've even heard there are
other facilities...
Cubes.
Christ.
Well, I just
heard rumors.
Why can't we
remember anything?
I don't know.
I always assumed
it was so that
they could have
a blank slate
to work with, but--
Blank slate?
You bastards have been
using us as lab rats.
Hey, man, not me.
I'm just a computer guy--
System checks,
stuff like that.
Oh, yeah. You just
followed orders.
Yeah.
You make me sick.
Look, you got it all wrong.
I hate my job.
Your job? How can you
do this to people?
It was your choice.
Look,
you volunteered,
only you don't
remember anymore.
At least, that's what
they told us. I...
You believed
them?
Well, yeah. I saw
the consent forms...
except for yours.
You're lying.
Who would volunteer
for this?
Well, it was either this
or execution, so...
What?
They say you're all
condemned prisoners
who volunteer
for the experiments
instead of facing
the death penalty.
I never did anything
to deserve this.
Yeah. Well, tell that
to Meyerhold, right?
Hey! We're innocent,
damn it!
I didn't volunteer
for this!
I know. See,
your consent form
was missing.
Shut up.
While you were doing
your systems checks,
did you happen to
see a little girl?
No. Yes. I mean...
I saw her.
I saw one,
a little girl...
in, uh, your dreams.
What?
Yeah.
It's hard to explain.
Uh... here.
You see, another thing
they have us do
is record the subjects'--
well, the people's dreams.
Her name's Anna, right?
Haskell: They can see
into our dreams?
Yeah.
Where is my daughter,
you piece of shit?!
I don't know.
You're lying!
No. Please.
I came to help.
Rains.
We need him.
Why?
I can show you
the exits.
Ok. Go ahead.
Where are they?
You were wrong
about the cube.
It's only 25 rooms
all around.
Only 2 rooms
have "Z" coordinates,
value 26.
They periodically move
to the perimeter,
but those 2 exit points
are monitored.
Now, there's supposed
to be an auxiliary exit
that leads directly
outside the cube.
How do we get
to that one?
I don't know.
So what use
is he?
He can show us
how to avoid the traps.
Yes, definitely.
Ok. Just read me
the coordinates
from the surrounding
rooms, please.
I was right.
They're coordinates.
Jax: Well, well...
it seems
that our little mouse
is a rat after all.
Mr. Finn, could you do
something about that, please?
Yes, sir.
This one's "C, F, P."
What the hell?
Damn.
What is it?
The letters--
they just disappeared.
What?
They're all gone.
They know I'm here.
So now would be
a good time to move.
Good idea.
You first.
Ok.
I can't make any promises,
but this should be the way.
Jax: Mr. Quigley,
could you isolate
that quadrant for me, please?
Ah. Mr. Finn, show me
the current trap configuration,
Mmm...
Now, let's make
their life
a little more interesting,
shall we?
Ohh!
Ok.
Trapped.
It sure looked easier
from my desk.
Ohh!
They've trapped all
the rooms around us.
Now what?
Really glad
you showed up to help.
My god. I'm actually
starting to enjoy myself.
You know what?
I think we should all
keep getting together
and doing this a lot more often.
Oh, goddamn it.
What?
Sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
Right away, sir.
"Just finish it, you idiot."
Ungrateful cretins.
You didn't hear that.
Ok...
gentlemen,
we have the word
from on high.
It's time to blow
this popsicle stand.
Mr. Quigley.
Sir?
You heard the man.
Just finish it.
Yes, sir.
Ok, ok.
Let me think.
Let me think.
What the--
Ah, christ!
Ohh!
Ok, ok.
Aah!
Now what
do we do?
Ah...
The floor.
The floor!
I'm sorry.
Goddamn it!
I don't want to
die in here!
What's happening?
What stopped it?
Wynn: Uh... I don't know.
Jax: Come on,
you piece of...
What the hell?
I don't know, sir.
We suddenly lost contact.
Yes. I can see that.
Why?
Maybe the energy required
for the test itself
blew out the capacitor.
I mean, we're not talking
state-of-the-art equip--
Wrong.
That's not how it works.
That's not how
it was designed.
Someone is screwing
with the connection.
I don't know, sir.
It isn't me.
Me neither, sir.
What?
I have no idea.
It's not me.
I swear.
Now, you wouldn't
lie to me,
now, would you,
Mr. Clod?
No, sir.
Wouldn't think of it.
Questions?
Comments?
What are we
waiting for?
Get us back
on line.
Damn.
Nothing.
"Nothing" is
not an answer.
Uh, excuse me, sir.
Excuse me.
What is it?
Uh... can I use
the facilities, sir?
Just go!
For the love of...
Where do they find
these people?
Quigley: I don't think
it's the software, sir.
Finn: It's definitely
a hardware problem.
Yoo-hoo. Listen.
This is getting
embarrassing now, ok?
I needn't remind
you gentlemen
that in a few minutes,
we'll have no choice
but to send people
in there, and it'll--
Call me impulsive,
but I could probably think
of a couple of names.
Quigley. Finn.
You know,
right off the top--
What is that noise?
Something's wrong
with the main power source.
It's gone
into reset mode.
What the hell
is going on?
Boot.
Oh!
Oh, damn.
You can say
that again.
What?
The power go out?
Yep.
So the traps
don't work.
That's
the good news, yeah.
What's
the bad news?
It's gone
into reset mode.
The system will restart itself
in 10 minutes.
The first routine
that runs on restart
is a clean sweep.
That as bad
as it sounds?
The clean sweep program
flash-incinerates
anything still living
in all the rooms.
So, we've
got to move.
Well, which way
do we go?
Uh... I don't know.
Ok, ok. Last time
I ran the numbers,
you were pretty much
in the center of the structure.
So I guess we just keep
going in the same direction
Until we get
to the edge, right?
Great. So we're back
to square one.
Do you have
a better idea?!
No, I don't, because
I'm not the one
who uses people as
fucking guinea pigs
in this place!
Whoa! Wait.
Back to square one.
Dodd. Dodd
is the only one
who could power it
down this quickly.
But he knows
that the reset mode
would kick in.
So why would he...
Of course.
The clean sweep
happens
after they realign
to zero position.
What?
Quick, let me see
your map.
When the power comes on,
the rooms are programmed
to realign back
to their original positions
before the clean sweep
starts.
Now, if we're in one
of the exit rooms,
like "A, Z, Z" here,
it'll move us
to the perimeter,
and we'll have about...
3 seconds to get out.
Before
it fries us.
Yeah.
If that room hasn't moved,
we might just make it.
Come on.
You know, Mr. Wodd has been
in the little boys room
an awfully long time.
Come on.
Gotcha.
A noble attempt
to save
your protege,
Mr. Dodd, but...
quite foolish
ultimately.
May I have that
widget back, please?
I don't think
I can do that, sir.
Mr. Dodd, are
you disobeying
a direct order?
Yes. There.
Cute...
and rather cliche,
in an endearing
kind of way.
Unfortunately,
I do believe
there is a penalty,
a rather strict penalty
for sabotaging
state property.
Ooh. Instant
paralysis.
They weren't kidding,
were they?
However, not to worry,
Mr. Dodd.
You still will
be able to feel.
All right. It's 5 minutes
till reset.
I think I found the source
of our power problem.
Does anyone know
where this goes?
Anyone?
That's the central
coupling.
I got it, sir.
Still doesn't solve
our observation problem.
They could be
escaping as we speak.
Sir, in less
than 5 minutes from now,
the clean sweep
kicks in,
and then I think
our problem will evaporate.
Mr. Finn, I don't
trust machines.
I have a machine
to thank for this...
and this.
I need to see them
with my own
god-given eye.
Of course, sir. I just...
I don't know how.
Shh!
Sometimes I even
amaze myself.
Mr. Finn, one
of our runaway rats
is a former squad
soldier, is he not?
Yes, sir. That
would be Haskell,
the big fellow.
Yeah,
the big fellow.
And they
still bio-chip
the enlisted men,
do they not?
Of course.
Sir, that's brilliant.
Ah.
Mr. Quigley
comes through.
Mr. Finn,
acquire us an uplink
to the squad
surveillance network,
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
Time.
Just over
Aah!
Hold on!
Aah!
There's no way
he survived that.
We got to go.
Come on.
And we're locked on.
Sir, we have
a visual.
It's a weak signal.
Ah. Your tax dollars
hard at work.
Well, transmit
the kill code.
Pain inhibitors
activated.
Neuro-chem enhancers
amplified.
Rains: Are we
there yet?
Wynn: Almost.
Haskell?
Move it!
Aah! Unh!
Get off her!
Unh! Uhh!
Unh! Uhh!
Thanks.
Yeah.
Ok. Come on.
How much farther?
We're almost there.
"A, Z, Z."
this is it!
Uh!
It's ok.
The power's out.
The power's out.
Chickliss.
Oh, man.
Just over one minute!
Can't this thing
go any faster?
Ohh!
Sir, we've got
the grid display back.
They're
at the perimeter.
till clean sweep.
Well, I think it's time
for our little surprise.
I hope your shortcut worked,
Mr. Quigley.
Water?
The auxiliary exit.
Leads directly outside.
Now what?
Can you swim?
Wynn: Jump... down!
No!
Jump!
Jax: Well, did we
get them?
Sorry, sir.
Signal got scrambled
at flashpoint.
I think
we got them.
I don't like it.
Get a squad
to the exit point.
Hey, this way.
Come on.
No. Run.
Run! Go!
He's conscious.
Thank god.
Well, welcome back,
Mr. Wynn.
You're conscious,
so, yes, we can begin now.
"Eric Wynn...
"as you have been
found guilty
"of high treason, sabotage,
and various other crimes
against your country
and your god..."
and so on and so forth,
blah, blah, blah...
"your sentence
has been extended
for 2 more lifetimes.
What sentence?
I don't even
remember the trial.
Oh. Well, you
were found guilty.
No further questions.
Wait! What
are you doing?
Well, we've decided
on a few, uh,
modifications
before putting you
back inside.
Wait!
Mr. Wynn, you are
holding up progress.
Don't I get
a choice?
Don't all the condemned
get a choice?
Well...
I choose death.
No, Mr. Wynn...
you do not get a choice.
You have already
made your choice.
I believe this
is your signature.
I... I don't
understand.
"I don't understand."
You chose to become
a test subject
many years ago.
Now you simply
don't remember that.
Oh, it's all
standard procedure.
But my job, Dodd,
Owen, Chickliss.
All lab rats,
just like you--
Observing the observers,
you know, that kind of thing.
"Oh, very, very
interesting results."
Wait!
You're actually
starting to bore me now.
Where is she?
Oh, the elusive
Ms. Rains.
Uh... well, you needn't
worry about her.
You didn't catch her.
He's all yours.
Don't touch me.
Don't worry.
This won't hurt.
Wait!
Aah!
Anna: Mommy, I'm cold.
Why can't we
have a fire?
Rains: Shh. Because
the bad people might find us.
Hey, I have
something to show you.
See? That's us.
We're superheroes.
These are very special
because they were drawn
by a very special person.
Is he
a superhero, too?
Yes.
Yes, he is.
Man: What's wrong
with him?
He doesn't seem
to know we're here.
This room is green.
Hi there.
This room is green.
Yes, it is.
Woman: What is it?
Shock?
I want to go back
to the blue room.
I think he's
mentally handicapped.
That's all we
need-- a retard.
Don't.
How the hell did he
survive in here?
I want to go back.
I want to go back.
Back. Back.
I want to go back.
I want to go... back.
