Previously on Supernatural:
Sammy.
Take your brother outside
as fast as you can. Go!
Dad's on a hunting trip.
And he hasn't been home
in a few days.
This is Dad's book.
I think he wants us to pick up
where he left off.
You know, saving people,
hunting things.
The family business.
I gotta find Dad.
It's the only thing I can think about.

With temperatures hitting below zero...
...we've got an unseasonably cold front
setting throughout the county.
We've got some pretty rough going
reportedly on I-55...
...with winds out of the north
at 40 miles an hour--
What the...?
Republicans are
$1 0 billion away from a budget deal...
...fighting over what seems
like a ton of money....
I think I found a way we can bypass
that construction east of here.
We might even make Pennsylvania
faster than we thought.
Yeah.
The problem is, we're not
going to Pennsylvania.
We what?
I just got a call from an old friend.
Her father was killed,
might be our kind of thing.
-What?
-Yeah. Believe me...
...she never would've called, never,
if she didn't need us.
Come on. You coming or what?
By "old friend," you mean...?
A friend that's not new.
Yeah, thanks.
So her name's Cassie, huh?
You never mentioned her.
-Didn't I?
-No.
-Yeah, we went out.
-You mean you dated somebody?
For more than one night?
Am l speaking a language
you're not getting here?
Dad and l were working a job in Ohio.
She was finishing up college.
We went out for a couple of weeks.
And...?
Look, it's terrible about her dad...
...but kind of sounds
like a standard car accident.
I'm not seeing how it fits
with what we do.
Which, by the way,
how does she know what we do?
You told her.
You told her, the secret.
Our big family rule number one:
We do what we do
and we shut up about it.
For a year l do nothing
but lie to Jessica.
You go out with this chick
in Ohio a couple times...
...and you tell her everything?
-Dean.
-Yeah. Looks like.
lt's a newspaper we put out,
not a bulletin for the mayor's office.
Get off your soap box, Jimmy.
I'm urging a little discretion, is all.
I think you're telling us
what you want us to print...
...and what you want us to sit on.
I know you're upset, Cassie.
I liked your dad a lot...
...but l think your grief
is clouding your judgment.
Two black people were killed...
...on the road in the same way
in three weeks.
Jimmy, you're too close to this.
Those guys were friends of yours.
Again, l'm very sorry for your loss.
Dean.
Hey, Cassie.
This is my brother, Sam.
-l'm sorry about your dad.
-Yeah.
Me too.
My mother's in pretty bad shape.
I've been staying with her.
I wish she wouldn't go off by herself.
She's been so nervous and frightened.
-She was worried about Dad.
-Why?
-He was scared. He was seeing things.
-Like what?
He swore he saw an awful-looking
black truck following him.
A truck? Who was the driver?
He didn't talk about a driver.
Just the truck.
He said it would appear and disappear.
And, in the accident,
Dad's truck was dented...
...like it'd been slammed into
by something big.
Thanks. Now, you're sure
this dent wasn't there before?
He sold cars. Always drove a new one.
There wasn't a scratch on that thing.
It had rained hard that night.
There was mud everywhere.
There was a distinct set
of muddy tracks...
...from Dad's car leading right...
...to the edge where he went over.
One set of tracks. His.
-The first was a friend of your father's?
-Best friend. Clayton Soames.
They owned
the car dealership together.
Same thing. Dent. No tracks.
And the cops said exactly
what they said about Dad:
"He lost control of his car."
Any reason why your father
and his partner might be targets?
-No.
-This truck ran them off the road?
When you say it aloud like that....
Listen, l'm a little skeptical
about this ghost stuff...
...or whatever it is you guys are into.
Skeptical? lf I remember,
I think you said l was nuts.
-That was then.
-Hmm.
I just know l can't explain
what happened up there.
So l called you.
Mom.
Where have you been? l was....
I had no idea
you had invited friends over.
Mom, this is Dean,
a friend of mine from college.
And his brother, Sam.
Well, l won't interrupt you.
Mrs. Robinson.
We're sorry for your loss.
We'd like to talk to you for a minute,
if you don't mind.
I'm really not up to that just now.
Jimmy meant something to this town.
He was one of our best.
We won't be the same without him.
Our best seem to be dropping like flies.
Clayton, my father, Jimmy.
What is it exactly you want me to do?
How about closing
this section of road, for starters.
Close the main road,
the only road in and out of town?
Accidents do happen, Cassie.
That's what they are. Accidents.
Did the cops check for additional
denting? See if it was pushed?
-Who's this?
-Dean and Sam Winchester.
Family friends.
This is Mayor Harold Todd.
There's one set of tire tracks. One.
Doesn't point to foul play.
Mayor, the police and town
officials take their cues from you.
-lf you're indifferent--
-lndifferent?
Would you close the road
if the victims were white?
You suggesting l'm racist, Cassie.
I'm the last person
you should talk to like that.
And why is that?
Why don't you ask your mother?
I'll say this for her, she's fearless.
Mm-hm.
Bet she kicked your ass
a couple times.
What's interesting is, you guys never
look at each other at the same time.
You look at her
when she's not looking...
...she checks you out
when you look away.
It's just an interesting observation
in a, you know...
...observationally interesting way.
You think we might have
more pressing issues here?
Hey, if l'm hitting a nerve--
Let's go.
Excuse me, are you Ron Stubbins?
You were friends
with Jimmy Anderson?
-Who are you?
-Mr. Anderson's insurance company.
Here to dot l's and cross T's.
We were wondering, had the deceased
mentioned any unusual experiences?
-What do you mean, "unusual"?
-Well, visions, hallucinations.
It's all part of a medical examination
kind of thing. Very standard.
-What company you say you're with?
-All National Mutual.
Tell me, did he ever mention
seeing a truck? Big, black truck?
What the hell you talking about?
You even speaking English?
Son, this truck,
a big, scary monster-looking thing?
Yeah, actually, l think so.
Hmm.
-What?
-l have heard of a truck like that.
You have?
-Where?
-Not where, when.
Back in the '60s,
there was a string of deaths.
Black men.
Story goes, they disappeared
in a big, nasty black truck.
-They ever catch the guy who did it?
-Never found him.
Hell, not sure they even really looked.
See, there was a time...
...this town wasn't too friendly
to all its citizens.
Thank you.
-Truck.
-Keeps coming up, doesn't it?
I was thinking.
You heard of the Flying Dutchman?
Yeah, a ghost ship, infused with
the captain's spirit. It was part of him.
So, what if we're dealing
with a phantom truck?
The extension of some bastard ghost
re-enacting past crimes.
The victims have all been black men.
I think it's more than that.
They all seem connected to Cassie.
All right. Well, you work that angle.
-Go talk to her.
-Yeah, I will.
Oh, and, you might also
want to mention that other thing.
-What other thing?
-The serious unfinished business.
Dean, what is going on
between you two?
We were a little bit
more involved than l said.
Oh, okay.
Okay, a lot more. Maybe.
I told her the secret about what we do
and l shouldn't have.
Look, man, everybody's gotta
open up to someone sometime.
Yeah, l don't.
It was stupid to get that close.
I mean, look how it ended.
Would you stop?
Blink or something.
You loved her.
Oh, God.
You were in love with her,
but you dumped her?
Oh, wow.
She dumped you.
Get in the car.
Dean.
-Hey.
Hey. Come on in.
So you busy or...?
The paper's doing a tribute to Jimmy.
Uh, I was just going
through his stuff...
...his awards.
Trying to find the words.
-That's gotta be tough.
-This family owned the paper.
The Dorians?
They had a whites-only staff policy.
After they sold it,
Jimmy became the first black reporter.
He didn't stop until he became editor.
He taught me everything.
Where's your brother?
Not here.
All right. So, what brings you here?
Trying to find the connection.
By the way, did you talk to your mom
about Todd not being racist?
I did.
-She didn't wanna talk about it.
-Right.
So just then,
why'd you ask where my brother was?
-Nothing. Not important.
-Because without him here...
...it's you and me,
not you, me and Sam...
-...which would be easier?
-lt's not easier.
-Look, I--
-No. Forget it. It's fine.
We'll keep it strictly business.
I forgot you do that.
Do what?
Oh...
...whenever we get--
What's the word, "close"?
Anywhere in the neighborhood
of emotional vulnerability, you back off.
Or make some joke. Or find
any way to shut the door on me.
Oh, that's hilarious.
-l'm not the one who took that door.
-Wait a minute.
-Who took the key and buried it.
-We done with this metaphor?
I was totally up-front with you
and you nailed me with it.
The guy l'm with, the guy
I'm hoping might be in my future...
-...tells me he pops ghosts.
-Those aren't the words I used.
-He has to leave to work with his father.
-l did.
If you want out, fine,
don't tell me this insane story.
It was the truth. It didn't sound insane
the minute you thought l could help.
I thought you just wanted to dump me.
Whoa, let's not forget
who dumped who, okay?
-l thought it's what you wanted.
-Well, it wasn't.
-l didn't mean to hurt you.
-Well, you did.
-l'm sorry.
-Yeah, me too.
We should fight more often.
Absolutely.
Actually, we were always pretty
good at fighting.
This we were good at.
It's all the other stuff, not so much.
Hey, I tried.
I told you who l really was.
That was a big first for me.
Why'd you tell me?
I don't know.
I....
I guess I couldn't lie to you.
Dean.
You told me that story...
...it scared the hell out of me.
I thought you were nuts.
Dangerous even.
Actually...
...maybe l was looking
for a reason to walk away.
In my work...
...l see some horrible things.
Things that can't be explained.
I deal with them.
But working things out with you?
-l'm a scary one, all right.
-Hmm.
Well, usually things get worked out...
...when you really want them to.
Yeah, but l'm still really involved
with my dad's work.
No more excuses, okay?
From you or me.
Okay.
Yeah?
You're kidding.
He's with me.
Where were you last night?
-You didn't make it back to the motel.
-Well....
You guys worked things out?
We'll be working things out
when we're 90.
-So, what happened?
-Every bone crushed.
Internal organs turned to pudding.
The cops are stumped.
It's like something ran him over.
-Something like a truck?
-Yep.
-Tracks?
-Nope.
-What was the mayor doing here?
-He owned the property.
-Bought it a few weeks ago.
-But he's white, doesn't fit the pattern.
Killings didn't happen up on the road.
That doesn't fit, either.
-Here.
-Thanks.
I'm trying to find some link
between the '60s and now.
There wasn't a lot about it
in the paper.
Not surprising.
Probably minimal police work too.
Back then, equal justice under the law
wasn't too literal around here.
-- Yeah?
- The records...
...show that Mr. Mayor
bought an abandoned property.
The previous owner was the Dorian
family for, like, 150 years.
-Dorian?
-Yeah.
Didn't the Dorian family
used to own this paper?
Along with most everything else.
Real pillars of the town.
Right, right.
-That's interesting.
-What?
This Cyrus Dorian.
He vanished in April of '63.
The case was investigated,
but never solved.
That's the time the murders
were going on.
I pulled paper up on the Dorian place.
Must've been in bad shape...
-...when the mayor bought it.
-Why?
-The first thing he did was bulldoze.
-Mayor Todd knocked down the place?
It was a big deal. One of the oldest local
houses left. He made the front page.
You got a date?
Uh, the 3rd of last month.
Mayor Todd bulldozed
the Dorian family home on the 3rd.
The first killing was
the very next day.
Dean. Dean!
Maybe you could throw
a couple shots in that.
You didn't see who was
driving the truck?
It seemed to be no one.
Everything was moving so fast.
And then it was just gone.
Why didn't it kill us?
Whatever's controlling the truck
wants you afraid first.
Mrs. Robinson, Cassie said that...
...your husband saw the truck
before he died.
-Mom?
-Mm-hm.
Oh, Martin was under a lot of stress.
You can't be sure about
what he was seeing.
After tonight,
we can be reasonably sure...
...that he was seeing a truck.
What happened tonight,
you and Cassie are marked.
Okay? Your daughter could die.
So if you know something...
...now would be a good time to tell.
Dean--
- -Yes.
-Yes. He said he saw a truck.
-Did he know who it belonged to?
-He thought he did.
-Who was that?
Cyrus.
A man named Cyrus.
Is this Cyrus?
Cyrus Dorian died more
than 40 years ago.
How do you know he died,
Mrs. Robinson?
The paper said he went missing.
How do you know he died?
We were all very young.
I dated Cyrus a while.
I was also seeing Martin.
In secret, of course...
...because interracial couples
didn't go over too well then.
When I broke it off with Cyrus
and when he found out about Martin...
...l don't know, he changed.
His hatred.
His hatred was frightening.
-The string of murders.
-There were rumors.
People of color disappearing
into some kind of a truck.
Nothing was ever done.
Martin and....
Martin and l, we were gonna be married
in that little church near here.
But last minute, we decided to elope
because we didn't want the attention.
And Cyrus...?
The day we set for the wedding...
...was the day someone
set fire to the church.
There was a children's choir...
...practicing in there.
They all died.
-Did the attacks stop after that?
-No.
There was one more.
One night, that truck came for Martin.
Cyrus beat him something terrible.
But Martin, you see, Martin got loose.
And he started hitting Cyrus...
...and he just kept hitting him
and hitting him and....
Why didn't he call the cops?
This was 40 years ago.
He called on his friends...
...Clayton Soames
and Jimmy Anderson.
And they put Cyrus' body
into the truck...
...and rolled it into the swamp
at the edge of his land...
...and all three of them kept that secret
all these years.
-And now all three are gone.
-So is Mayor Todd.
Now, he said that you of all people
would know he's not a racist.
-Why would he say that?
-He was a good man.
He was a young deputy back then...
...investigating Cyrus' disappearance.
Once he figured out what Martin
and the others had done...
...he did nothing.
Because he also knew
what Cyrus had done.
-Why didn't you tell me?
-l thought l was protecting them.
And now there's no one
left to protect.
Yes, there is.
Ah, my life was so simple.
Just school, exams...
...papers on polycentric cultural norms.
I guess I saved you
from a boring existence.
Yeah. Occasionally, l miss boring.
So this killer truck....
I miss conversations that didn't
start with "this killer truck."
-All right, so this Cyrus guy.
-Yeah.
Evil on a level that infected
even his truck.
When he died,
the swamp became his tomb...
...and his spirit was dormant
for 40 years.
-So, what woke it up?
-The construction on his house.
-Or the destruction.
-Right.
Demolition or remodeling can
awaken spirits, make them restless.
Mm-hm.
-Like that theater in lllinois?
-Yup.
And the guy who tears down
the family homestead, Harold Todd...
...is the same guy that kept
Cyrus' murder quiet and unsolved.
So now his spirit is awakened
and out for blood.
I guess. Who knows what
ghosts are thinking.
You know we're gonna have to dredge
that body up from the swamp.
-Man.
-You said it.
Yeah.
-Hey.
-Hey.
She's asleep.
-Now what?
-Well, you stay put and look after her...
...and we'll be back.
Don't leave the house.
Don't go getting all authoritative on me.
I hate it.
Don't leave the house, please?
You coming or what?
All right. Let's get her up.
All right.
Little more. Little more.
Little more.
All right, stop.
-Nice.
-Hell, yeah.
-Now l know what she sees in you.
-What?
Come on, admit it.
You're still in love with her.
-Aw, could we focus, please?
-l'm just saying, Dean.
Hold that.
-All right. What am l getting?
-Gas, flashlight.
-Got it.
-Let's get this done.
-All right.
Got it.
All right, let's get to it.
Think that'll do it?
I guess not.
-So burning the body had no effect?
-Sure it did.
-Now it's really pissed.
-But Cyrus' ghost is gone, right?
Not the part
that's fused with the truck.
-Where are you going?
-For a little ride.
-What?
-Lead that thing away.
That piece of crap, burn it.
-How am l supposed to burn it?
-l don't know.
Figure something out.
Figure something...?
-Give me a minute.
-l don't have a minute.
-What are we doing?
-Uh, let me get back to you.
Hey, Cassie? Hey, it's Sam.
Okay, l need some information
and it has to be exactly right.
All right.
-This better be good.
-Where are you?
-The middle of nowhere...
...with a killer truck on my ass.
It knows l put the torch to Cyrus.
Listen. lt's important.
I have to know exactly where you are.
Decatur Road, about two miles
off the highway.
-Okay. Headed east?
-Yes!
-You son of a bitch.
-Okay, turn right.
Up ahead, turn right.
-- You make the turn?
- I made it.
-Move this thing along a little faster.
-You see a road up ahead?
No. Wait.
-Yes. I see it.
-Okay, turn left.
What?
-All right. Now what?
-Go seven-tenths of a mile...
-...and stop.
-Stop?
Exactly seven-tenths, Dean.
Seven-tenths, seven-tenths.
-Dean, you still there?
-Yeah.
-What's happening?
-lt's staring at me.
-What do I do?
-What you are doing.
-Bringing it to you.
-Yeah.
Come on. Come on.
Dean? You still there?
Dean.
-Where did it go?
-Dean, you're where the church was.
-What church?
-The place Cyrus burned down.
-Murdered those kids.
-There's not a lot left.
Church ground is hallowed,
whether the church is there or not.
Evil spirits cross over hallowed ground,
sometimes they're destroyed.
So l figured maybe
that would get rid of it.
Maybe? Maybe?
-What if you were wrong?
-Huh.
Honestly, that thought
hadn't occurred to me.
"Well, it honestly didn't occur to me."
I'm gonna kill him.
My mother says to tell you
thanks again.
This is a better goodbye
than last time.
Yeah, well, maybe this time
it'll be a little less permanent.
You know what?
I'm a realist.
I don't see much hope for us, Dean.
Well, l've seen stranger things happen.
Hell of a lot stranger.
Goodbye, Dean.
I'll see you, Cassie.
I will.
-l like her.
-Yeah.
You meet someone like her,
ever make you wonder if it's worth it...
...putting everything else on hold,
doing what we do?
Why don't you wake me up
when it's my turn to drive?
