MORTON :
So the next week,
he's even hornier,
but this time
he's got 20 bucks
instead of 1 0.
He goes back
to the whorehouse,
he slaps down a 20,
tells the madam
he needs to get off
but he ain't gonna screw
no damn chicken this time.
She says
it still ain't much ,
but she can help.
She tells him
to go to the room
at the top of the stairs.
This time,
it's just a bunch
of guys jerking off.
But one of the jerk-off guys
assures him . You know,
"lt's cool , it's cool ,"
and he waves him over
to this hole in the floor
that they're all
looking through .
Can we stop, please?
l really gotta take a piss.
Fuck you .
So anyway,
there's these two hot lesbians
and they're going at it.
What, are you
praying now?
Oh , Lord , won't you
grant me an empty
mayonnaise jar to piss in?
You know, Krug ,
considering the rather
notorious nature of
the prison you're headed to,
l think l'd pray for
something a little bit
more substantial .
Fuck!
FRANClS: Come on .
Here.
You okay?
Yeah .
Did l do good?
Tell me l did good !
H it us a little harder
next time, Francis.
Where's my kid?
He's fine.
What?
l can't understand you !
l think he's saying ,
"Take my money."
Take the money, huh?
l think he's dying now.
What do you think
he's seeing?
Something
he'll never see again .
H i .
What's my time?
lt's perfect, awesome.
Come on .
Hand it over.
Come on .
Let me see it.
lt's great.
Mom , let me see.
Sweetheart,
your time is perfect, okay.
lt's time for vacation .
JOH N : Tell the OR that
the compound fracture
to the left femur
is on its way up.
We're transfusing two units
of O-Neg . l want them
to have plenty more on hand .
FEMALE N U RSE: Yes, Doctor.
So, Mr. Hadley,
can you just
follow my finger?
J ust like that. Excellent.
You're gonna be fine, okay?
We'll get you back
on your bike in no time.
Let's go, guys.
l love that shirt,
by the way.
The color alone must've taken
a few minutes of your time.
H i .
Hey.
Hey, Mary-Anne.
WOMAN : Yeah?
Where's that head CT
l ordered?
lt's been half an hour.
EMMA: He got a B-minus
for the semester,
which is fantastic,
and l will be happy
to write him
a letter of recommendation .
Yeah , if you need to get
in touch with me this summer,
you have my cell .
Okay, have a great summer.
All right. Bye-bye.
That woman drives me nuts.
Okay, so are you
on vacation now
or should l just make a U-ey?
Dad?
Dad?
Honey!
Yo, yo.
What's up, what's up?
Are we there yet?
We are making
the turn now.
Geez, you think
somebody would
change that sign .
l kind of like it.
lt tells me
the turn's coming up.
My hydrangea
came back.
Place looks good .
Yeah . l'm sure inside
is a different story, but. . .
Why?
Yeah , why?
l didn't tell you?
Dan was up
fishing last week.
No, Em , you didn't.
You let your brother
stay here?
EMMA: Yeah .
U nsupervised?
Honey, don't worry.
l made him promise to sleep
in the guest house. lt's fine.
So he and whoever
he was with trashed not
one house but two, right?
Would you mind
if l stayed
in the guest house?
l promise
l won't trash it.
"Hey, kids,
have a drink on me.
"Thanks for letting me
fish the lake out.
Love, Dan ."
This is $4 champagne.
So? Be nice.
Oh , shit.
JOH N : Jesus.
H i .
H i .
What the. . .
Microwave is broken?
l don't know
how he did it.
Oh , no. Honey,
my brother did not
break the microwave.
You have
no evidence of that.
Hey, do you guys
need the car today?
'Cause l was thinking
maybe l could
meet up with Paige.
She said
she'd be working today.
Okay. But we just got here.
l was gonna cook supper
and hangout and . . .
Well , maybe you guys
could have a nice dinner
alone tonight?
Here you go.
Mom , are you sure?
No, l'm not sure,
but Dad seems
awfully sure about it.
l know that you haven't
seen Paige in a while. So. . .
Here. Have fun .
Whoa. Thanks, Dad .
All right.
J ust promise,
promise that you will call me.
Okay? That's all l'm asking .
Okay, l will .
All right?
Love you .
l love you .
Bye, babe.
Bye, Dad .
l'll see you guys later.
Okay.
Please
be careful .
PAlG E: l don't know
if you're gonna
be able to keep up
with the fast pace
of the town , but we just got
a new yogurt stand , so. . .
Whoa, you think you can
get us a table?
Yeah .
You know, l got connections.
l could probably
pull some strings.
MAN : How much
do l owe you for this?
That is $5.25.
Thank you .
Have a good day.
Listen , Mari , l . . .
l couldn't believe it
when l heard about Ben .
l know.
l know
l should have
called you .
l just figured . . .
Paige, you're fine.
lt's. . .
Well . . .
Okay, new subject.
Yeah , yeah .
So, what do you feel
like doing tonight?
Do you . . .
Do you still smoke pot?
No, l don't really do
that stuff anymore.
Yeah , you're like
a big athlete now, or. . .
Hey.
Yeah , do you need
a basket for all that?
l don't think we've met.
What's your name?
lt's J ustin .
J ustin , l'm Paige.
And this is Mari .
Mari , this is J ustin .
J ustin , this is Mari .
H i .
Hey.
ls that all for you?
Can l get
a pack of cigarettes?
Can l get some l D?
Can you just
give me a pass?
J ustin , l would
if l ruled the world , but. . .
What if you help me
and l help you?
And how are you
gonna help me?
Look, you know, l've got
some premium grade-A shit
back at the motel .
Really?
Yeah , l mean ,
you can see it
for yourself.
l mean , l overheard you guys
talking a second ago, so. . .
That's $ 1 3.20, right?
Okay, from $20.
Here you go.
Thanks.
Your turn .
PAlG E: Here we are.
Very fancy, J ustin .
Left or right?
J USTl N : Left.
So, Mari , l'll just run in
and grab it, and then
we can go back to my place.
My dad's not
gonna be home
all night.
MARl : Okay, five minutes.
All right,
l'll be two minutes.
MAN ON RADIO:
Now it's weather and traffic,
and there's going to be
big clusters of storms
developing, going into
nighttime hours as well. . .
Sorry, so sorry, ma'am .
lt's. . .
This belong you?
No. No, sorry.
What the hell ,
you guys?
Mari , J ustin was not kidding .
This is really good shit.
Clearly.
So how long were you gonna
let me sit out there?
Here. Have some.
Paige, we just had
this conversation .
Come on .
She's a little
out of practice.
Take it.
l'm just sitting on the bed .
One joint won't hurt you .
Take it.
Hold on .
Hello, Mom?
Hey, Mari , you were supposed
to call me an hour ago.
l know. l'm sorry.
There's a storm coming in .
What time are you coming home?
l was thinking maybe
l could just spend
the night with Paige.
No, no, no.
That is not a good idea.
Listen to me.
You're 1 7 years old . . .
Hello? Mom?
You're breaking up.
l can't hear you .
Hello? Honey?
Hello? Are you there?
Mom , if you can hear me,
l'll be back first thing
in the morning , okay?
l love you.
Oh , my. . .
Who was that?
That was your daughter.
Now she's spending
the night with Paige.
This is ridiculous.
l knew this
was gonna happen .
l should have never
let her leave.
There isn't much
we can do about it.
She does have the car.
So, J ustin , my new
found friend , are you
from a really big city?
No, you know,
l'm kind of
from all over.
All over.
My dad and uncle
have us moving
around a lot, so. . .
What do they do?
All sorts of things.
You know, l'm kind of
out of the loop.
Well , where's your mom?
She's dead .
l'm sorry.
That's all right.
When did she die?
lt was a while ago, so. . .
That's probably enough
death talk.
Do you wanna
move on to
a happier subject?
Sure.
Someone died?
My brother.
About a year ago.
A year ago?
What was his name?
Ben .
Sorry.
You know what, Mari?
l think J ustin here
could be kind of cute
if he lost his whole, like,
creepy, hooded , U nabomber kind
of vibe he's got going on .
Don't you think?
Yeah .
Look at this face
he's got.
Here. Here,
put this on .
No, actually that's. . .
You know, that's my uncle's.
Well , he's not here.
J ust put it on . Come on .
Model it. Go on .
Put it on .
Not bad .
Yeah ,
but the hair doesn't match
the shirt anymore.
What could we do?
Come on , sit down .
All right.
l need some water.
You're gonna love it.
Trust us.
Okay.
Do you think the collar
should go up or down?
Put it up.
Collar up. No, collar up.
l think collar down .
Fabio.
l love it. lt's a big
improvement, J ustin .
You're gonna get
all the ladies.
MARl : Oh , yeah .
Evening .
Dad .
l . . . l thought you guys
weren't coming back. . .
Well , our timeline's
gotten sped up, so. . .
Why? What's going on?
For Christ's sake, nephew,
are you gonna introduce us?
Yeah , Frank.
This is Mari .
That's Paige.
That's my U ncle Frank,
Sadie.
That's my dad .
These are two
lovely girls, J ustin .
Smells like you three

some fun in here.
Yeah , it's like
a regular party.
Who else you invite?
J USTl N : Nobody.
lt's just us.
Dad , look, l was just
trying to liquidate some. . .
Liquidate?
ls that my word or yours?
Mine. But. . .
Am l wrong? ls that. . .
No, J ustin ,
you're not wrong .
FRANClS:

Yeah , Frank, l'm sorry. . .
No, no. Hey, hey, hey.
Keep it on .
Looks good on you .
J USTl N : You know,
we were just. . .
Playing dress up?
Well , l mean ,
we just sort of gave him
a bit of a makeover.
A makeover, really?
No.
PAlG E: Yeah .
Well , l think that's
the greatest thing
l've ever heard .
FRANClS: Wow.
We'll just get out
of your way, J ustin .
How much do we owe you?
l love your sweatshirt, Mari .
That your sport
utility out there, Mari?
Yeah .
N ice.
Yeah , we could use
a vehicle like that
right about now.
Yeah , 'cause ours
is pretty well fucked .
Like we are.
Thanks to you , pumpkin .
Fuck you !
Later maybe.
Dad , what is going on . . .
We made the front page.
That's what's going on !
We figured they'd have
my face on there
sooner or later,
but now they got
Sadie's to boot.
Can you believe it,
Paige, Mari?
Listen , mister. . . Sir. . .
This is none
of our business.
We won't. . .
You won't what?
This is none
of our business.
lt's a private matter.
Right. Right,
and we won't say
anything to anybody.
Well , l don't know.
Frank, you believe them?
Yeah . You know,
l think maybe l could .
Yeah , well , l don't.
Well , you should .
'Cause we really don't. . .
We really don't give a shit.
Hey, Paige, calm down .
l swear. . . l mean ,
we swear that we won't. . .
We won't tell any. . .
Paige.
Oh , my God !
We have thin walls, okay.
Oh , my. . . Please don't.
Please just. . . Please,
just put the knife down .
You can have my keys.
l don't care.
J ust don't hurt her.
Thanks, Mari .
J ust don't. . .
Please. . .
Okay,
sir, can we
please just go now?
Paige. . .
Please. . .
Do you not
like us, Paige?
l'm sorry, ladies.
We just can't risk it.
PAlG E: What?
No ! No, but. . .
Why can't you just. . .
Please, just let us go !
Paige, just stay calm .
God damn it!
Somebody. . . Oh , God .
Please. . . Fuck!
PAlG E: Somebody,

Don't fucking move.
Somebody help !
Somebody! Help me !
Please !
Somebody help me !
Help ! Somebody!
Hey!
What. . .
Anything?
No. No,
we're still okay.
Francis ! What the fuck!
She's taking a nap.
But she'll come around .
l hate cell phones.
Everywhere you turn ,
nothing but texting
and yakking and texting .
l hate them .
Load up.
J ustin .
l'm sorry.
They weren't supposed
to be back.
What?
That's your excuse?
Yes, sir.
J ustin .
You gotta start putting
other people's needs
ahead of your own .
You knew not to bring
anybody back here,
but you did it anyway.
Didn't you?
Because l thought. . .
Because we weren't
supposed to be here.
Well , you did it.
lt can't be undone.
Now you're gonna
take responsibility
for that action .
lt's as simple as that.
You know how we do that?
Look at her.
J ust look at her. God .
Would you just let them . . .
Look at her!
That's a good start.
Put your seatbelt on .
Hell .
We're okay.
You're okay.
Now l go left, right?
Looks like that road
that's over the mountain
is left.
Right takes you
back to the lake.
Go left.
l've been coming here
for years. You're looking
for H ighway 43,
the two-lane that goes
over the mountains. Right?
l guess that's
the one, Mari .
Then you need to go left.
Thanks for the clarity, Mari .
Thanks for being
so cooperative, Mari .
What good would it
do me not to be?
l always took your kind
to be whiny
little fucking bitches
born with silver spoons
up their asses, but you ,
l think maybe
there's hope
for you , Mari .
l don't know, Krug .
l think Mari here has some
potential you should consider.
Krug , what do you think?
l think she's been
a cool customer
ever since the motel .
He agrees.
SADl E: Oh , my God !
Come on !
You get the fuck. . .
Handle it!
Dad , watch out!
Shit.
Motherfucker.
You bitch .
Sadie, you okay?
Do l look O-fucking-kay? Fuck!
Oh , no. No, no, no.
This is gonna scar.

Well , then you should
let her know how
you feel about that.
Yeah !
Fuck!
You bitch !
SADl E: Fuck you !
Fucking bitch ,
you burned
my fucking face !
Why the fuck did you do that?
SADl E: Oh , my God !
PAlG E: Mari !
KRUG : Damn it! Fuck!
Mari !
MARl : Paige, run !
KRUG : Come here !
Bring her back!

You ready to be a man?

Pick one. Or both .
What are you doing?
KRUG : No, no, no.
No !
Come on .
Grab her.
Hold on !

a lesson , son !
J ust. . . Come on .
KRUG : Jesus, just like that.
FRANClS: Look at that.
Come here.
Yeah . See?
Let's get him
all worked up.
Get him all worked up
and tingling .
There.
What's the matter
with you !
Never gonna get
easier than this !
You're pathetic!
What'd you say, Paige?
Where did that
come from
all of a sudden?
My goodness.
Come here.
Are you gonna hit me now?
No, honey, not hit.
No !
No ! No ! No !
Paige !
You think l'm pathetic, Paige?
Look at my fucking kid here !
Well , Mari , looks like
she's in a lot of pain .
Get that hair
out of her mouth .
Tell her everything's
gonna be okay.
Tell her help's on the way.
Tell her it's not
as bad as it looks.
Do it. She needs you !
l won't!
KRUG : God damn it!
MARl : Leave me alone !
No.
Don't! Don't do this !
You think
you can fuck with me
whenever you want?
She doesn't
think so, see.
Come on .
She's a liar.
Look around .
Look what she did .
No ! No ! No ! No !
No !
KRUG : You hear that?
MARl : No !
No, please ! Please. . .
KRUG : Jesus Christ!
J ustin , please.
