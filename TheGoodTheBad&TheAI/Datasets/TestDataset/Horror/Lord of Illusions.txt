DivX.............
Swann.
And the fire said to me...
" Nix, Nix,
you are my instrument.
From now on you shall be known...
as...
the Puritan.
You will find a few good men...
and women...
and together...
together...
you will cleanse the world. "
Master.
Swann's here.
Are we ready?
- Ready.
- Maybe we should think about this.
He's gone too far.
So he took a kid.
He's gonna kill her.
He could drive us crazy.
So stay out here!
Please get away from me.
Hush!
Please don't hurt me!
I said, hush.
What is it?
What's the matter, huh?
Please! Please!
What are you gonna do to me?
Leave me alone!
Want me to shoot, Swann?
Leave me alone!
You don't like him, do you?
- He wants her magic.
- Maybe.
Go! Fetch him.
I think he's in love.
If you see the kid, yell.
- Quaid.
- Hey, man.
It's Quaid.
I thought you weren't
coming back.
I changed my mind.
You can't leave, man.
He won't let you.
You're gonna be okay.
Okay?
I knew you'd come.
I've got so much power
to give you, Swann.
All you have to do...
is beg.
Fuck you.
You don't think
that I've got it to give?
You're wrong!
I could eat your fucking soul!
Now be a good girl.
Fuck!
Stay here.
- Jennifer, are you okay?
- Jesus!
Stay away.
Stay the fuck away.
Are you okay?
How would you like...
to see the world...
the way it really is?
You wanna see flesh...
with a god's eyes?
Swann?
Here he is.
Take a look, Swann.
These are your friends.
What have you done to him?
- Swann--
- Don't touch me!
He got into my head!
You wanna be like that, Swann?
Mud? Shit?
Come here.
Share the power.
Swann.
Help me.
Bag.
Help me.
- What are you doing?
- Binding you.
You piece of shit!
This isn't over, Swann.
This isn't finished.
Dead?
Dead.
What now?
We bury him so deep...
no one will ever find him.
I been calling you
for three days, Harry.
I missed you too, Loomis.
You got a beer?
I got a job for you...
if you can tear yourself away
from all this weird shit.
You need a woman's touch
in here.
Why don't you get yourself
a secretary?
On what you pay me?
So get married.
Tried that.
Oh, yeah.
" Harry D'Amour, who describes himself
as a private detective...
has been linked with occult activities
on several occasions.
'We regard D'Amour
as a highly dubious character...'
quoted one source. "
That's nice, Harry.
It's all bullshit.
It was on TV last night.
You looked like shit,
by the way.
- Thanks.
- What's the story?
Was the kid really possessed?
Probably.
By what?
You know.
The usual.
You need a vacation.
Somewhere sunny, like...
L.A.
That's where the job is?
Guy's name's Tapert.
Big insurance fraud.
He's gone west to spend
his ill-gotten gains.
It's worth ten grand...
if you catch him doing it.
If I don't?
Catch a tan.
I need someone of your caliber
on this, Harry.
Taste the darkness, D'Amour.
It's been waiting for you.
Yeah, well, maybe I do
need a vacation.
You'll like L.A.
There's great weather,
great women.
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Have a nice evening.
You bet.
Hello, L.A.
Tapert's paying by the hour.
He's getting his money's worth.
Come here, you fuckers!
Come on in!
Wait a minute.
He's late for something.
What the hell?
Ever watched a man die?
If you watch very closely...
you can sometimes
see the soul escaping.
And if you're very quick...
you can catch it.
I wasn't there.
Ask Pimm.
Pimm's dead.
Jennifer Desiderio's
disappeared.
They knew the Puritan
was coming home.
So did you.
Wait.
Don't leave me.
Did you come for a reading?
My God.
What?
You are drawn
to the dark side...
over and over.
You don't like that.
Not much.
You can't change it.
You must walk the line...
between heaven and hell.
It is your destiny.
Accept it.
Hang on.
I'm not afraid to die.
There's something terrible...
coming home soon.
The Puritan?
Who is he?
Shit.
What were you doing up here?
I'm a private detective.
I was hired to follow a guy
named Tapert for a couple of days.
- Insurance fraud.
- Tapert.
So now I've got Tapert,
Butterfield--
Tapert's got nothin'
to do with this.
He just came
to get his palm read.
This is something else.
You ever heard of somebody
called the Puritan?
New one on me.
Let's see him.
Where the fuck is he?
He got up and walked.
After that fall,
he would've broken half his bones.
I don't think
he'd have given a shit.
D'Amour.
Why do I know that name?
I know him.
I saw him on TV.
Some kid got possessed,
and he saved the little bastard's life.
A priest?
He's just some guy...
who's got a nose for this shit.
Like you.
I don't want him
getting in the way.
He won't.
We've, all of us,
waited too long...
to have the homecoming spoiled.
What do you mean,
" all of us " ?
A lot of people
believed in Nix.
They haven't forgotten
his promise.
About?
Death.
What about death?
It's an illusion.
Coffee, Mrs. Swann?
Yes, thank you.
Where's Mr. Swann?
In his study.
He got something on his mind?
Hey. Mr. Sunshine.
That's what I'm gonna call you.
Bad show?
The usual.
Full house.
Standing ovation.
I tell them it's magic.
They believe you.
Yeah.
Remember Quaid?
Sure.
I think they killed him.
Oh, God.
I just saw him too.
I'm putting in
a new illusion tonight.
Something special.
I want you to be there.
Of course.
You want me
to find out about Quaid?
- I mean, the funeral?
- No.
I'm not going anywhere near him.
Higher.
Another inch.
The left hand side is too low.
Valentin?
Good. There.
Yes?
I want you to find
this man D'Amour for me.
Shit.
Mr. D'Amour.
Go away.
It's 1:00 in the afternoon.
Who are you, my mother?
I'm here to offer you
a job, Mr. D'Amour.
I'm going back to New York.
Have you got something in New York
that'll pay you 5,000 a day?
Do I get lunch?
Whose car?
Mine.
No, it's not.
You're driving it too carefully.
Maybe I just bought it.
Well, somebody's been
smoking in here for months.
Havanas.
You're not the smoker.
So, who is?
You'd almost pass
for a detective, D'Amour.
I work for the best illusionist
in the world.
- Philip Swann?
- You know of him?
Kinda hard to miss him.
I saw him perform once
in Vegas.
Are you a gambling man?
Swann is quite a magician.
Never call him that.
He's strictly an illusionist.
What's the difference?
Illusions...
are trickery.
Magicians do it for real.
Where'd the flower go?
Any movie stars buried here?
Probably.
It's not a bad place.
It's warm, lots of palm trees.
I don't think the dead
much care.
You sure?
- Are you a believer, then?
- Oh, yeah.
I signed on for all of them
in my time.
Catholic, Hindu, Moonies.
You can't have
too many saviors.
Who's that?
Swann's wife.
I want you to help me
help my husband.
He's in some kind of trouble-- something
to do with the man you saw murdered.
I think Philip believes
all that stuff with the tarot cards.
And you don't?
I think we make
our own futures.
So, what's the connection?
I don't exactly know.
Philip doesn't like to talk
about the past.
Why not?
He's a secretive man.
And you don't ask questions?
We don't share our lives
the way a lot of people do.
But obviously
you still care about him.
We wouldn't be having
this conversation if I didn't.
Swann is one of the most
remarkable men alive.
You don't believe me?
He's an illusionist.
That's not exactly brain surgery.
I'm sorry. You asked.
No, you're right.
He could've been something more.
Maybe a lot more.
But sometimes people get lost.
Even good people.
- Too much money, too much fame.
- Where do I sign up?
Will you take the job,
Mr. D'Amour?
- Harry.
- Harry.
When do you want me to start?
Come to the show with me.
It's his last performance
in L.A. tonight.
I want you to see him with an audience.
They love him.
Do you?
I didn't marry him for love,
Mr. D'Amour.
- Tonight?
- Sure.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
- I'm glad you could make it.
- Are you kidding?
This is a big deal for me.
I gotta have the tux back
by midnight.
Valentin!
I'm here.
The guy with Dorothea--
is that him?
- Check if he's ready.
- Ready?
Ready.
How the fuck does he do that?
It's wires.
- I don't see no wires.
- So, what is it? Magic?
Ladies and gentlemen...
you are standing on the threshold
of a miracle.
Come with me
into the great beyond.
He's good.
You haven't seen anything yet.
This is the new illusion.
Have you seen this before?
There's something wrong here.
For God's sake!
Wait! Who are you?
Oh, God.
Please.
Please, Dorothea.
Come away.
It's no use.
I got you, you fucker!
Who did this, D'Amour?
Who killed Swann?
You did.
Didn't you?
Why would I?
Beats me.
You don't have a clue
what you're into, do you?
I feel it!
Deep shit?
Who did this?
It was...
It was...
And this Butterfield guy?
Vanished.
Another fucking magician.
Jesus.
You through with me?
For now.
You planning on moving back
to New York?
No, not yet.
- They treating you all right?
- Yeah.
I heard what happened.
I think I'm gonna
stick around for a while.
Maybe dig in places
that cops wouldn't look.
I wouldn't know
where you'd start.
Maybe with the other illusionists?
They won't tell you anything.
I can be very persuasive.
Yeah.
I think you probably can.
Scotch on the rocks.
Where did you learn that?
Oh, this stuff?
At birth.
Are you a professional, or did you
just come here to watch the shows?
A bit of both.
I know most of the young kids
who are coming up...
but didn't recognize you.
Well, I'm in from New York.
I came out to see Swann.
Yeah, Swann. Swann.
Jeez, that was a tragedy.
The general thinking around this place
was that it was just a question of time.
He was taking a lot of risks?
You'd better believe it.
A lot of risks.
My name's Walter Wilder,
by the way.
Not the Walter Wilder.
Dear boy,
the one and the only.
Take a couple of cards
and try this nonsense.
If you knew Swann,
you must have known Vinovich.
Yeah.
Vinovich knew Swann
way, way back.
He said there were a lot of drugs
around, a lot of crazy shit.
Let me ask you something...
Walter.
I'd love to hang
with you guys for a while.
Magicians are
a pretty cagey bunch.
I suppose it's a question of
who do you know?
Actually, nobody.
Well, you do now.
Now, down here is
what they call the repository.
Behind those locked doors...
lies every secret of magic
known to mankind.
- Ever been in there?
- Me? No.
No, there are only three keys.
Vinovich has got one,
of course.
It is more than entertainment.
We are opening up people's heads.
We are bringing miracles
back into their miserable little lives.
But they're fake miracles.
Houdini believed
he had spirit guides.
Do you believe that?
I believe...
that we walk a narrow path...
between--
Heaven and hell?
Divinity and trickery.
So then, sometimes...
the miracles are real.
No. They are always fake.
The saints, the messiahs,
they were just illusionists.
You could walk on water?
I can reproduce any miracle
that has ever been performed...
with a little preparation.
Even one of Swann's?
- They were no damn good.
- Really?
That's funny.
I heard he was one of the best.
If he was so good,
why is he so dead?
You tell me.
I figured
you'd have some theory.
I have many theories.
I'd like to hear one of them.
I'm not saying another word.
You damn fool, Wilder.
This man is a journalist.
No, I'm not a journalist.
I just wanted to know about Swann.
He was a freak.
Everything he did was tainted.
- With what?
- Evil!
He was evil.
Are you coming?
Do not speak to this man
if you wish to keep my company.
That's a great accent.
What is it, Brooklyn?
Fuck you, all right?
Harry.
I've got to be careful.
- If Vinovich sees me talking to you--
- What do you want, Billy?
I heard a name.
Someone they talk about
in whispers.
Who?
Nix.
He's dead now,
but I think maybe he taught Swann.
Who's doing the talking?
Vinovich.
But you burned
your bridges there.
This is me.
Good luck.
I loved what you did in there.
What are you looking at?
I just want to know what Philip saw in
those cards and stop it from happening.
Divinity and trickery.
Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.
I know it's late.
It's okay.
How'd it go today?
Went up to the Magic Castle.
You were right. He didn't
have a lot of friends up there.
They were jealous of him.
Why?
Because he had you?
He didn't have me.
I told you.
Yeah, you didn't marry him
for love.
So, why did you marry him?
That's none of your business,
Harry.
You ever hear of somebody
called Nix?
Dorothea?
Yeah, I'm here.
I don't know the name.
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
It doesn't ring a bell.
I have to go.
That's it?
All right.
Look, I'll keep digging.
Yeah. You do that.
" Keep Out
Police Department "
Ever watched a man die?
Yes.
" Desiderio. "
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.
- I tried the hotel.
- So why you'd come here?
You're a detective
with no clues.
Where else would you look?
Do you mind?
I'll keep this brief.
Here's $30,000.
What for?
A ticket home.
You didn't hire me. She did. She wants
me to stop, I wanna hear it from her.
- She doesn't want to see you.
- No?
- People are dying here.
- Yes.
It's a terrible tragedy.
Is that all you have to say?
It's a fucking terrible tragedy?
- I want to know why.
- Why people die?
Give it up, D'Amour.
Go home.
Don't try to see her, D'Amour.
Just leave her alone.
Lock up, will you?
Jennifer has only ever had
one visitor.
- Mr. Quaid?
- Right.
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Yeah.
Heard it on the news.
Jennifer doesn't know...
and frankly, this isn't
the best time for her to be told.
I won't say anything.
She's been with us for four years
and she was coming along nicely.
Past month she's been
worst than ever.
- What's her problem?
- She has no real grip on reality.
- Does anybody?
- Oh, yes.
We have to agree on what's real and not.
That's what holds us together.
What does Jennifer think
is real?
She thinks the devil's
coming for her.
Have we met before?
Only I forget.
They give me pills, you know,
to make me even.
And I...
I forget things.
You didn't forget me.
I just came to see if you remembered
a man named Butterfield.
Maybe. I...
That's okay.
What about Philip Swann?
I knew Swann.
He's a fucking liar.
Why is that?
He said he knew
how to protect us.
But he didn't know anything.
He made us think
it was over and done with.
What was?
I don't wanna think about it.
If I think about it, he'll...
he'll hear me.
He'll find me.
Swann?
I told you. I don't want...
What is it?
Calm down.
No, he'll get me!
He's not-- He's not--
Who's not gonna get you?
Nix. Nix.
- And he's the Puritan?
- Yes!
- And he's dead?
- No.
He's coming back.
He's digging his way out.
I'll take care of her now.
Jesus.
