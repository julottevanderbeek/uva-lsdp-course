We have 182 patients.
Most are horribly deformed,
due to inbreeding and birth defects.
Ward "C" is high security.
Each patient in here should be considered
dangerous or a danger to himself.
No one can get in or out without
first passing through this door.
We can open all the cells
at once in case of fire...
but the protocol is
one cell open at a time.
Thanks, Charlie.
- No problem, boss.
-
I know what you're thinking. But we have
to do this for their own good.
This is not a prison.
We hope to rehabilitate the patients
if at all possible...
and have them rejoin
the general population.
Before any cell is opened,
you must have an orderly--
-
-
Bobby! Bobby!
- Let go!
-
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
That just surprised me.
That's all.
You shouldn't wander
past the yellow lines.
- They can and will grab you
from their cells.
-
These are the Hilliker brothers.
-
-
We call them that because
Mrs. Hilliker found them in the woods...
standing over the partially eaten remains
of what we think were their parents.
And the little bastards are smart.
Definitely the most dangerous
patients in the hospital.
They're just kids.
And the most dangerous?
Yes. Trust me.
The youngest one, the one sucking
on the stump of his hand?
- Yeah?
- He chewed off his other two fingers.
We never found them.
We think he ate them.
The middle child. He poked
out his own eye with a fork.
Ate it right in front of a nurse.
And the large boy with the mask?
He has abnormally large teeth, which
he was sharpening on the stone walls.
We put the mask on him
after he bit several orderlies.
Sharpening?
How can he tolerate the pain?
That's the fascinating thing about
these children. They can't feel pain.
They have an advanced form
of congenital analgesia.
- That's extremely rare.
- Yes.
But it's more prevalent
in homogeneous societies.
- Like the inbred communities
of West Virginia.
- Exactly.
-
- Can they talk?
Just grunts and gestures.
It's their own language.
Never turn your back on them
or their cell.
No offense, Doctor. But these are beyond
your kind of therapy. Musical or otherwise.
I'd like to work with them, Dr. Ryan.
Maybe after a while.
Why don't we play it safe for now?
Come on. I'll show you the rest
of the hospital.
Sure.
-
-
Hey, get me out of here!
Gone.
Come here. Get in here.
Get me out.
Hey! Let me out!
Hey, guard!
-
-
-
-
-
-
Huh?
No! No!
No! Oh, no!
-
-
No!
I can help you if you just let me go.
- I can help you.
-
-
-
-
-
No!
No!
-
-
-
-
Oh, my God. Oh, God.
No!
-
-
-
-
No!
Oh, please. Don't do this to me.
Boys, you don't need
to do this to me.
Please! God, no!
Ohh! Ohh!
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes!
-
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God!
- You like that?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Come on.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
You guys are a bunch
of slut monkeys.
- Heard of knocking?
-
Porter has already left. Kyle and Claire
are probably waiting for us on the mountain.
My car leaves in five minutes whether
you guys wanna be in it or not.
Why don't you just relax and jump
underneath the covers for a bit?
I don't think Bridget would
appreciate that very much.
I don't really mind.
- I don't mind either.
- Hey!
- Just kidding.
- Five minutes, you rabbits.
-
-
Why aren't we going to Aspen this year?
Porter's cabin sucks.
Because my dad lost his retirement
and had to sell the house.
- Really?
- Yeah, you should have
seen him when he found out.
I thought he was gonna
jump off a bridge. Hey.
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Hey.
- Hey.
Where's Porter?
- He went on ahead
to get the cabin warmed up.
- Oh.
He must be sick or something
'cause usually Porter's a douche bag.
- Only to you.
- I know. What's that all about?
Um, I don't know. Maybe it's because
you keep making passes at me?
He's that insecure?
Is there something you want to tell me,
Kenia? I'm here for a sister.
- Uh, fuck off. Fuck off.
-
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hey, man.
-  This is my ride.
- Hi.
Hey!
- I am so excited. Aren't you?
- I'm so excited.
- Hey, guys. Sorry we're late.
- Hey.
- Daniel's fault.
- The roads were bad.
So who's driving?
I'm driving.
You drive like a girl.
I want to go fast.
-
- Thanks. Real nice.
Then you're gonna
wanna ride with me.
- Okay.
- There you go.
Hey, Kyle? I heard on the radio
there's a huge storm blowing in.
You think maybe we wait?
Do this tomorrow?
It'll be okay, princess.
We'll be at the cabin in an hour.
- All right. Let's hit it!
-
- All right!
- Yeah.
- What about the cars?
Are we okay to park here?
- Oh, my gosh.
Jesus, Daniel. You got to worry
about everything? They'll be fine.
Let's go already.
All right. Excuse me.
Seriously, Daniel?
- What?
- Check out Daniel.
-
- What? Safety first!
I'd like to see you laughing
when you fall off your snowmobile.
- Uh-huh.
- All right. Let's go!
-
- Whoo-hoo!
- Let's go!
- Let's do it!
Come on. Let's go already.
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo!
All right. Let's go!
I'm not waitin'
Gonna come out and live my life
This storm's not over yet
Fightin' this feelin'
that something's goin' wrong
I think you better listen,
better open your eyes
Your whole life
they sat there feedin' you lies
Fightin' this feelin'
that something's goin' wrong
Don't look down
Just turn and run for your life
Follow my voice
I'm the only one that's gonna survive
And don't look down
Just turn and run for your life
Follow my voice
I'm the only one that's gonna survive
- Whoo-hoo! Whoo!
- Up close!
- Come on. Let's go!
-
- Oh!
- Whoo!
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Whoo!
- Hey, ladies!
- Whoo!
-
- ...gotta go!
- Whoo-hoo!
-  The only one that's gonna survive
- You're lost.
- No, I'm not.
Just admit it.
Idiot. It's frickin' freezing out here.
It must have dropped 20 degrees
in the last half an hour.
We've got an hour of daylight left.
There's a huge storm
blowing in any minute now.
Just give me a minute
to get my bearings, all right?
-  Hey? Hey!
- What?
We should be going left
up there over that hill.
No, I've been to the cabin a hundred times
with Porter. It's right. I'm sure of it.
We need to get over
that far ridge over there.
Fine. Then let's go.
I'm freezing too.
- Yeah. Come on!
- Come on, guys.
Yeah.
He's making a wrong turn. I know it.
Sorry, guys! I guess
I got turned around!
If we don't find some shelter soon,
we're gonna freeze to death!
I say we go back
the exact same way we came!
Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
Let's turn around...
head back down the mountain,
and follow your tracks in the snow.
What tracks?
They've been blown away.
- What's that?
- What's what?
That huge, dark shape
along the side of the ridge.
I think it's a building!
Frickin'-A! We're saved.
- Come on! Let's go!
- Okay.
- I'm freezing!
-
Come on. Come on.
-
-  Don't slip!
-  Thank God.
- Bridget, I could kiss you.
- Ohh.
- It's open. Come on.
Oh, my God.
Honey, you want your ski gear?
Leave it. I've got my bag,
and it's freezing!
- Ohh!
- I'm freezing.
- What is this place?
- An old hospital maybe?
- Well, it looks like we're
visiting for the night.
- Great.
- Shall we?
- Mmm.
What is this place?
- Holy crap.
- Why is it so warm in here?
Maybe there's a janitor
here or something.
They probably keep the boiler
going so the pipes won't freeze.
You're really lucky
this place was here, man.
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.
- Creepy.
- Oh, it's dusty.
- Gross.
- It's disgusting!
- I'm just glad we're inside.
- Ew! Did you find that in here?
- Yeah.
- Don't touch it.
- That's so creepy!
- Uh-huh.
-
- Can you guys find something to burn?
Scrap wood or furniture? Something.
-  Yeah. We're on it.
- Yeah.
- What about Porter?
- He's going to be expecting us.
You don't think he'd go out
in this weather, do you?
No. Porter's way too smart for that.
Maybe you should give him a call.
Let him know we're safe.
Good idea.
My freaking cell service sucks.
Does anyone have a signal?
I'll check. No.
- Nothing.
- Shit.
Kenia, Porter's a really smart guy.
He's gonna know we wouldn't
go out in this weather.
You're talking about
Porter being smart?
-
- Which Porter is that?
Well, he's a hell of a lot smarter than
Kyle, who got us lost. Remember?
I didn't say Kyle
was smart either.
Porter's probably nice
and toasty right now.
Yeah. I hope so.
Okay. Who's up for
a weenie roast? You?
You? You?
I know you are.
All right.
Got it?
Hey.
Scooch, scooch, scooch.
Yay!
All right, guys. I just want to say sorry
for the mix-up out there.
I know things could have
turned out really bad...
but I'm glad we're all okay.
Don't worry about it, dude.
It could have happened to anyone.
It's fine. We're all fine.
We'll go to the cabin in the morning.
I think the weather
should be clear by then.
Let's just try to get some rest.
No way! Have you seen this place?
It's fucking fantastic.
Let's check it out.
Do a little exploring.
Trespassing?
God, Daniel.
Wow.
- All right. All right. I'll go with you.
- Yeah, me too.
You girls gonna be okay alone?
- Don't get lost again.
- Thanks.
Wait. You expect us girls
to cook dinner?
It's hot dogs.
I think you ladies can handle that.
Well, maybe I don't want to.
That's right, Bridget.
You don't do hot dogs, do ya?
-
- Fuck you, Vincent.
Let's go.
- Wait. I'll go with you.
-  Yeah, me too.
Hey, wait up. I'm coming too.
- Wake up.
-
Hey, check this out.
It looks like somebody's
been here recently.
Hunters probably use this
to hold up in during the spring runoff.
Do you guys think anyone would
actually be here right now?
I mean, that would be
really creepy.
No. No one's hunting
in this weather.
Ax murderers do.
- Just saying.
-
Hey, this must be
the head honcho's office.
"Dr. Brendan Ryan, Chief of Staff."
Well, let's see if the chief
had any good stuff.
Oh. What the hell
happened in here?
Hey, check out this coat
and stethoscope.
Hey, Jenna, hop on my desk.
We're gonna do a porn scene.
- Oh, God.
- Me doctor, you nurse.
- Vince, you mind?
- Do her.
I'm busy with my patients.
Hey! Hey! Get away from me!
So, Miss Perrin.
How long have you been having
these reoccurring nightmares?
Well, it all started
when I was 12.
I-I felt this presence
in my room at night.
Was this about the time
of your first period?
You're a fucking pervert.
You know that?
Violent dreams are a direct result
of menstruation in young women.
- Had you masturbated yet?
- Ew!
You're fucking disgusting.
Oh! Jackpot.
Looks like the good doctor was a boozer.
Anyone for a snort?
Please tell me
you're not gonna drink that.
It's a 30-year-old bottle of scotch.
Thirty years ago, Jenna. Unopened.
Mmm. That is smooth.
- To pussy.
-
Ooh!
- Holy shit.
- What?
That's some fucked-up shit.
What the fuck is that?
A person.
What the hell happened to him?
-  Born that way.
- Poor son of a bitch.
- Oh! That is so wrong.
-
-  Jesus!
- What was this place?
According to the records,
it was the Glenville Sanatorium.
- Isn't that where crazy people
are locked up?
- No, that's a sanitarium.
A sanatorium is a hospital that isolates
sick people from the rest of the population.
What was wrong with these people?
I don't know.
They're all deformed
from what I can tell.
I'm gonna take some of these
and read them.
I just hope it wasn't contagious.
- All right.
- Come on. We should
get back to the others.
Yeah.
That's a great idea.
He's kind of cute
when you're stoned.
You know, in like an E. T. kind of way.
Wow, babe.
You know, you're a lot more fucked up
than I thought you were.
-
- Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, I found a patient ward
that's got beds and shit.
Oh, gross. I don't want to sleep
on a filthy mattress.
We'll lay our sleeping bags
over the top.
It's better than sleeping on the hard floor.
Plus, we get a little privacy.
- Ooh.
- Okay.
We'll be back, guys.
- All right.
- Night.
- So long.
Hey.
- You wanna come check it out?
- Sure.
I'm not enough?
Ah, you are mine.
See? It's not so bad.
Okay.
Okay, I say we all pick a room.
And then everyone puts
their keys in a bowl...
and we pick to see
who sleeps with who.
- You just don't stop, do you?
- It's what I do best.
-  You got that right.
-
Hey! I think I just saw somebody.
Ghosts. Awesome.
No, it wasn't a ghost.
I think it was a person.
Well, there's nobody there now.
If you want me to take a look, I will.
No. Nobody here.
Whew.
-
-
Oh, my God.
Vincent?
This isn't funny, Vincent!
Vincent, answer me!
- I'm going. This isn't cool. No.
- No, no, no!
- No!
- Don't leave me alone. Come.
Vincent.
Vincent.
Vincent.
Vincent?
- Whoa!
-
You fucking asshole!
Calm down. Trying to have some fun.
Oh, I can't believe you!
-
-  God! He's such a jerk.
Ohh!
Kenia?
-
-
- Move!
- Hey, what's up?
He's a fucking jerk.
I scared the piss out of them.
You should have seen it.
You have the mentality of a 10-year-old.
You know that, right?
- Okay.
- I could have fallen in the dark.
You have no idea
of the consequences...
of your stupid,
incessant pranks.
Well, a place this big has gotta
have its own generator.
And since you two
are afraid of the dark...
I'll see if I can find it and get
some heat and lights started.
Finally, you're doing
something useful.
Hey, Vincent can be useful
in many ways, can't you, baby?
Don't go bragging now, babe.
Ciao, kiddies.
You doing okay?
Okay. That good, huh?
We got gas.
Let's see if you'll run.
Hey. Hey, hey!
See? I told you he was useful.
Sometimes.
Happy now?
Yes. Thank you so much.
All right. Well, let's go have some fun
'cause I found some really cool shit.
Yeah!
- All right.
- Come.
-
- Ohh!
-
-
There's a new voice in my head
Monsters underneath my bed
-
- Whoo!
Things happen
when you go too far
- Whoo-hoo!
-  So play one time and push me down
I put your flowers on the ground
And here he comes again
And here he comes again
And here he comes again
Ohh, ohh, ohh
He never had no mercy for me
-
He never had no mercy for me
-
-  He never had no mercy for me
-
He never had no mercy for me
There's a voice inside my head
-  Monsters underneath my bed
- Yeah! Wow!
-
- Go, go! Let's go!
So play one time
and push me down
I put your flowers on the ground
And here he comes again
-  And here he comes again
- The winner!
And here he comes again
- Oh, go, go, go!
-  Ohh, ohh, ohh
He never had no mercy for me
He never had no mercy for me
He never had no mercy for me
- Turn right! Turn right!
-  He never had no mercy for me
Go!
I got it. I got it.
Whoo!
This place is amazing.
The freaks had their own auditorium.
Can you imagine those guys
up there putting on their own play?
It gives a whole new meaning
to the term freak show.
Yeah, I bet everyone was
a variation of the Elephant Man.
Hey, they watched movies here.
- Hey, let me see that.
-  Okay, movie time.
- Shall I fire it up?
- Yeah!
- Who's up for popcorn?
-  Whoo!
- Fine.
- Yeah.
They're just creepy.
I think it's kind of sad.
I wonder what
happened to them.
Yeah.
You know?
I remember this place now.
My brother used to scare the shit
out of me when I was a little girl...
with stories about the hillbillies.
What stories?
He said there was a bunch
of inbred West Virginia hillbillies...
that got rounded up
way back when--
- Ew!
- and locked up in this old hospital.
-  Oh, my God.
- They're deformed 'cause they
kept on screwing each other.
Ew!
He said that's not all
they did to each other.
What else?
He said they ate each other. Cannibals.
-  Are you serious?
- That's bullshit.
-  Yeah, right.
- That's an urban legend.
He'd tell me the stories every time
we drove through Greenbrier County.
Show's over, folks.
- Yeah.
- I don't know about you guys,
but I am going to bed.
Lauren?
-  Hey, Jenna? Wanna go?
- That's a good idea.
Yeah, for some nightmares.
Let's go, baby. Bedtime.
Hey, who wants to run the stairs
with me in the morning? Anyone?
Wake and exercise?
I think I'll sleep in.
-  Us too.
-
What are you doing?
I can't sleep. I'm gonna go explore.
Okay. Don't go
fucking with anybody.
They're asleep and it's so not cool.
I get it. I won't.
- I promise.
- Mmm.
Hey, you! Who's there?
You better not be
playing with me, dude!
I'll beat the shit out of you!
Porter, is that you?
Porter, when did you get here?
Holy shit. You scared
the hell out of me, man.
This place is great, isn't it?
Dude, what are you doing? Let's go.
Dude, are you asleep?
Holy fuck!
Vincent?
Great. We're almost out of weed.
Well, that's 'cause you
smoked it all last night.
- Where's my shirt?
- I don't know.
- Here.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey, have you seen Vincent?
-  No.
- No?
He went exploring last night,
and I can't find him.
You haven't seen him
since last night?
- No.
- Oh.
- Well, he's got to be
around here somewhere.
- I know.
- I'll help you look.
- Thanks.
This place is so huge.
He could be anywhere.
Yeah.
Hey, guys, have you seen Vincent?
- Not since last night, no.
- No.
No? Ohh.
We're, uh-- We're looking for Vincent.
Haven't seen him.
I wouldn't worry about it, guys.
We're not going anywhere.
Have you seen it out there?
It's snowing like crazy.
- Hey, Sara, have you seen Vincent?
- Yes.
- Really? Where is he?
- I saw him last night
doing his peeping tom bit.
- He was watching me and Bridget.
-
- What about this morning?
- No, I haven't seen him. I've
been running for the last hour.
Let's eat. Breakfast anyone?
- Mm-hmm.
- We'll grab our stuff.
- What about Vincent?
- He'll show up.
I'll meet you guys down there.
-
- Seriously. Go to hell.
Hey, where did all our shit go?
Vincent's probably trying
to mess with us, bro.
Don't worry about it.
Just throw some wood on the fire.
Jesus. It's bad out there.
Guys, do you think we should wait
for the storm to blow over?
No. Look, I say we pack up,
we find Vincent, and we get going.
Yeah. Let's split up
into two groups though.
Daniel, you take Bridget, Sara and Lauren
and check the upper floors.
Everyone else come with me. We'll
check the first floor and the basement.
We'll meet up in the auditorium
in half an hour.
I'm-- I'm not done eating.
Kyle, come on. Geez.
Does anyone not think
it's weird our stuff is gone?
You guys, the sooner we find him,
the quicker we can leave.
Let's go.
Here you go, princess.
- I'm a princess. Thanks.
-
You think it's funny?
Oh, wait! Yes.
Let's move it.
Yeah. He's dead for sure.
Shut up, Kyle.
Come on, Vincent!
Vincent, we've got food!
-  Vince!
-  I really don't like this anymore.
What is that?
-  Oh, what is all this?
-  Wow.
Well, we're definitely
checking this out.
- Wow.
- Whoa.
So, I guess if you
didn't follow the program...
- they had some serious slice and dice--
- Get out of here!
We're looking for
Vincent, remember?
-  Yes.
- Yeah. Let's go. Come on. Come on.
- Quit goofing around.
- Let's get out of here.
Ward "C." Open the door.
Let's check this out.
They locked them up like animals.
They look like animals.
Come on. Let's keep moving.
What's that?
It looks like a nurse's station.
Vincent definitely would have checked to
see if there were any drugs left behind.
-
- Yeah, probably.
It's blood.
Oh, my God.
All right, stay here, okay?
I'm gonna check it out.
Do you think it's Vincent's?
Uh, I mean, he-he-- he could have
cut himself on something.
Vince?
Well, I say we each take a hallway.
We can cover more ground that way.
- Mm-hmm.
- Sounds good to me.
This way?
- I guess we're going this way.
- I guess so.
Vincent?
-
-
-
-
I'm really starting to get worried.
- He'll show up.
- I'm sure he just fell asleep somewhere.
He smoked pretty heavy last night.
He's probably stoned right now,
in a corner having a bad trip somewhere.
Yeah. Hey.
- Did you guys find anything?
- Yeah.
- What?
- A small amount of blood.
-  We are not alone here.
- What do you mean?
Somebody is fucking with us.
- What?
- I wanna get the hell outta here now.
-
- They're gonna kill us all!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That looks like Porter's jacket.
That is Porter's jacket.
-
-  Hang on!
Claire!
-
- Claire! Claire!
Help! Claire!
-
-
Don't look up! Hold on!
Claire!
-
- Claire, hold on!
Oh, God! Claire!
Come on! Come on!
The fucking door's locked! It's locked!
Girls, come on!
-
- Hurry!
Oh, my God! Shit!
- It won't start!
- Neither will mine!
Shit.
They've stripped
the spark plug wires.
- Mine too.
- They sabotaged the fucking snowmobiles!
What are we gonna do now?
We won't last on foot in this storm.
We don't even have fucking jackets.
I say we go back inside and figure out
a way to defend ourselves.
- Who the fuck are they?
- The cannibal hillbillies
my brother told me about.
Who else could it be?
- What are you doing?
- I'm going for help.
Baby, you'll freeze to death.
I'm the strongest skier.
I've got the gear.
I'll make it down the mountain,
and I'll call the police.
- Baby, I really don't think you should go.
- I'm going.
If anybody can make it, it's Lauren.
I'll come back for you.
Okay? I promise.
Be careful.
What are we gonna do?
I'll see you soon.
And now what?
Please, Sara, please!
We can't go back in there.
- We have to.
- No.
The doctor's office--
It has a sturdy door and a lock on it.
All right, it's right
near the entrance.
- I can't do that.
- We either freeze to death or we fight.
That's the plan.
Okay.
-  We have to get weapons.
- I've got mine.
The rest of us need them too.
This is crazy. We need to get
the hell out of here!
As soon as the storm breaks,
that's what we're gonna do.
Guys? Guys, look at this.
This is the guy that attacked Claire
on the balcony.
It says they were violent,
mentally, physically deformed...
and showed signs of cannibalism.
- How did they survive out here?
- They're hunters.
And now they're hunting us.
They'll eat anything.
Fuck! They probably turned Porter
into porterhouse by now.
Just shut up!
-
-
The basement.
- That cage thing.
- What?
Yes. Yes.
That cage downstairs
with all the knives and saws in it.
- We should all go together.
- No, I don't think so.
Let's just stay here
until help comes.
Look, how about you girls stay here.
Daniel and I will go.
- You lock the door behind us.
- Whoa!
- Thanks for volunteering me.
- We need to do this.
I-I just think we should all go together.
Strength in numbers.
You seriously
gonna chicken out on me?
Fine.
- Fine. I'll go.
- Good.
-  I'll go with you.
- No. Don't.
I'll be fine. You stay here with Kenia.
Sara, please. Don't.
I'll be right back
before you know it.
Okay?
Ready, guys?
Ready as I'll ever be.
Lock the door.
It's not much further.
It's just up here to the left.
-
-  What the fuck was that?
Run!
-  Let's just fight him!
-  He's got a fucking ax!
Just run!
Over here.
- He's coming. Let's kill him.
- Kill the lights.
-
-
Kyle? Is that you?
Sara? Daniel? Is that you?
-
-
Help me!
He won't let go!
Help me!
-
- Go away, you motherfucker!
He's going away.
- Don't open the door.
- We gotta get back to the others.
Fuck him.
If he comes back, we'll kill him.
Come on. Come on!
Shh!
It's clear. Let's go.
Sweet.
Let me go, you fucking freaks!
Kenia? It's us. Are you okay?
- What the fuck happened?
-  Hurry!
Open up! Open up!
-
- Yeah.
Where's Daniel?
He was right behind me.
- We have to go back for him.
- No, no, no!
It's dangerous out there.
They could have got him.
Open the door.
We'll just see if he fell behind.
Daniel? Daniel?
I don't see him.
Okay, we gotta
figure out what to do.
No! No! No! Oh!
Oh, God! God, somebody help me!
Somebody help me!
I stabbed him in the arm, and he left.
-
- Shh! Did you hear that?
It's Daniel. We've gotta help him.
What are we waiting for?
Listen!
Fuck you!
Help--
He's probably dead already.
I'm not gonna
leave him out there if he isn't.
Listen! We have to have a plan...
if we're gonna get out of here alive,
and I have one.
Does it include leaving Daniel to die?
If they have Daniel already,
Bridget's probably right.
But if he's hiding,
we need to be organized...
- and have a plan to capture these freaks.
- How?
-
- Aaah! Oh! Oh! No, no!
What the fuck are you doing?
- That's him. Let's go.
-  No! It could be a trap.
- What?
- It could be a trap.
Somebody help me!
They have him, and he's the bait
to get to the rest of us.
She is right. Why else
would they keep him alive?
I don't care if she's right.
I agree with Kyle and Sara, okay?
- We can't leave him to die.
- Just a minute ago, you said not to go.
Yeah, that's when I thought
he was dead. Now I know he's alive.
Fine. I say we vote.
What?
Those who want to stay,
raise your hand.
Those who want to go.
Fine. Let's go.
- What do you got?
- Here.
-  Come on.
- Come on. You ready?
Come on.
He's in the basement.
What the hell are they doing to him?
God! God, let me-- Let me die.
God, let me die!
Wait! Wait!
Think what's down there.
- Uh, the cell ward "C"?
- The kitchen and cell ward "C."
- I'll go check it out.
- You come back to us.
Done.
Mmm!
-
-
-  Oh, God.
-
Oh, God.
God, let me--
I'm sorry. God, let me die!
God, please--
-
-
Where is he?
He's in the fucking kitchen.
They strapped him to a table.
It was fucking horrible.
What?
They're stripping pieces
of flesh off of Daniel.
They're boiling it in oil,
and they're eating him.
They're eating him alive
like some fucked-up fondue.
Oh, my God.
How many are in there?
There's three. There's one big guy
and two small guys.
Jenna, you take that. You go down
the hall to the juncture with Ward "C."
We'll force them out
the back door of the kitchen.
When they come to you,
you throw the lamp. Okay?
- They're gonna have no choice
but to go down to the cell ward.
- Okay.
- Are you ready?
- Let's fucking go.
Ready? Let's go!
-
-
- Come on!
-
Let's kill them.
- Yes. Let's do it.
- Wait. We can't just kill them.
What? Why the fuck not?
They killed our friends, and they
were gonna kill us and fuckin' eat us.
Yeah, we're not them.
Fuck that! Hey, you. Look at me.
Look at me.
Fuck you, you motherfuckers!
I'm gonna cut your fucking hearts out!
You understand that?
Go get the other
kerosene lantern.
We're gonna roast
these fuckers alive.
-
-
Time for a barbecue, fuckers.
Kyle, don't do this.
- They deserve it.
- Yeah, they do...
but you don't.
Don't do this to yourself.
Give me that lighter.
Give me the lighter.
Okay. What the hell
are we gonna do now?
We find the spark plug wires,
and we leave in the morning...
storm or no storm.
Where are the spark plug wires?
-
- The bastards can't even talk.
Fine. Then we search.
Room by room.
Okay. But somebody
has to watch them.
I will.
I won't touch a fucking hair
on their head. Okay?
Okay.
Go look for the wires.
Send someone back in
a couple hours to relieve me.
We'll take shifts
throughout the night.
Hey, you.
Are you hungry?
Come on, take it.
Fuck you, motherfucker!
You thought I was actually
gonna feed you?
-
-
You know I'm actually gonna kill
all three of you, don't you?
I will.
I'm gonna say I forgot something...
and then I'm gonna come back...
and I'm gonna kill each
and every one of you freaks.
Just sleep tight.
There's nothing here.
Guys, this place is so big...
we're never gonna find them.
I say we pick another room
and keep looking.
No. We need our strength.
If we look all night, we're gonna
be no good for tomorrow.
Yeah, but if we can't find
the spark plug wires we can't leave.
I'm walking out of here at dawn.
Let's head up to the doctor's office
and bed down for the night.
I'll take the next watch.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna relieve Kyle of his shift.
Be careful.
I will. You too.
You want to lock it after me?
I got it.
Okay.
-
-
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit.
It's only the generator.
It's only the generator.
-
- Oh, God!
Kyle?
Kyle?
Fuck.
Kyle?
Oh, shit! Shit.
-
- It's Kenia! Hurry! Let me in!
Come on, hurry!
- Come on. Come on.
- What happened?
- Gone.
- Gone?
The three freaks, they're gone.
-  And Kyle?
- He's gone too. There's no sign of him.
- What?
- Do you think Kyle killed them?
No. Wouldn't he be here
right now if he did?
Okay, we have to
get out of here now.
We stay barricaded in until morning,
and then we make a run for it.
Everyone agree?
Okay, if we make it till then.
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.
I'm gonna go check it out.
Don't get too close.
-
-
- Who is it?
- It's the small one.
He's unarmed.
Let's fucking kill him.
This is strange.
This could be a trap.
- The other two could be around the corner.
- But what if they're not?
We can kill one right now
and improve our odds.
Let's fucking kill him!
There are four of us, and there's
one of him. Let's fucking do it.
Yeah.
All right.
Okay, but we go as a group,
and we come right back here.
-  You ready?
- Yes.
Let's go.
You fuckin' pervert, die!
Die! Die, motherfucker!
-
-
Oh, no! No, please, no!
No, no, no!
Why didn't he say anything?
Because the bastards
cut his tongue out.
-
-
We gotta get back!
-
-
-
-
We're trapped in here.
They're coming!
Upstairs, quick!
Go. We'll hide in the attic. Go!
This is where they live.
And where they'll come back to.
Let's get out of here.
Yeah, now.
Look, coats. Grab some gear.
- No, I'm not putting those clothes on.
- Oh, yes, you are.
-  We can survive in these.
- Take this.
- Hurry!
- Let's go.
Head down to the main floor.
See if we can find a way out.
-
-
We've got to find a way
to lock ourselves in.
Here. Here. Go.
There. That should
keep them out for a while.
We need to find a way
to get out of here.
We have to climb out a window.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Grates. We're fucked.
They can't all be grated.
To keep the freaks in?
You bet they all are.
-
-
- Hey, everyone. Come here.
-  What?
The grate has rusted out.
Give me a hand.
-
-  Careful.
-
- Shit!
The fuckers are at the door.
Hurry!
Stand back.
I'll dig a hole. You guys follow.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Hurry!
I'm out.
- You're next. Get going.
- Okay.
Get going. I'll be right behind.
Clear!
Come on, Kenia!
Come on! Hurry! Hurry!
I'm clear!
Come on, Jenna. Hurry!
Now!
-
-
Jenna, can you hear me?
Hold my ankles.
Get me out of here!
-  Jenna? Jenna?
- No.
Come on! We gotta get going!
Come on! Come on!
Get up! We have to go!
Come on!
We've gotta keep going!
Follow me. Stay close.
Come on!
We've got to move quicker! Run!
They got our snowmobiles.
Move! Move!
-
- Keep going!
-
- Go away!
Please! Go away!
No!
Where are they going?
Who cares? Come on!
Can you stop?
I dropped the fireplace poker.
I gotta go back and find it.
- We don't have time for that.
- It's a good weapon. We need it.
Stay with Bridget, okay?
I've gotta go back.
Come on! Come on!
-
- Oh, God.
- They're coming in both directions.
- What?
- I don't see any lights.
- They turned them off.
Get down and hide. Get down.
- I can't do this. I can't do this.
- Get down.
I can't do it.
-
- Bridget!
No!
Kenia? How bad is it?
I don't know. It fucking hurts.
- Come on. Come on.
- They got Bridget.
Okay, let's get you
to the tree line.
Then I'll go back for her, okay?
Come on.
We've gotta get your jacket off.
Ow! Fuck.
- Just do it.
- You ready?
-
-
- Okay, baby.
-
That should slow the bleeding.
Go find her.
You'll be all right here?
I'll be right here. Okay? Okay.
Bridget! Where are you, Bridget?
Hang on! Bridget, I'm coming!
-
-
Sara?
Bridget?
Bridget!
Bridget? Sara?
Sara. Sara.
Oh, my God!
No! No! Bridget?
Sara! Where are you?
Sara!
Oh, my God!
Sara!
Please-- Please help me!
- Anyone.
-
No. No!
No!
Sara!
Yes! It worked.
Good job.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Take a bruised hip,
you'll take skinned knee
Take a million hits
fore I ever can see
Screamin'
"Is that all you got?"
As I bleed
I always come back
Whoo!
Oh, no!
I need you now
Don't fade away on me
'Cause I made a mistake
I think I took a wrong turn
There along the way
I sealed my fate
And all I know is you've gone
Yeah, you're gone away
I'll never touch your face
I'll never see you again
And I watch each day
through the fallin' snow
The dead men walkin'
through their highs and lows
Wishin' they could start again
Somewhere new
And instead I'm cold
and I feel their pain
I watch as their life slowly fades away
I see their eyes
They're piercing mine
There's nothing I can say
I made a mistake
I think I took a wrong turn
Somewhere along the way
Somewhere along the way
I sealed my fate
And all I know is you've gone
Yeah, you're gone away
I'll never touch your face
I'll never see you again
'Cause I made a mistake
I think I took a wrong turn
There along the way
I sealed my fate
And all I know is you've gone
Yeah, you're gone away
I'll never touch your face
I'll never see you again
Well, I'm not waitin'
I'm gonna come out
and live my life
This storm's not over yet
I'm fightin' this feelin'
that something's goin' wrong
I think you better listen,
better open your eyes
Your whole life
they sat there feedin' you lies
I'm fightin' this feelin'
that something's goin' wrong
Don't look down
Just turn and run for your life
Follow my voice
I'm the only one that's gonna survive
And don't look down
Just turn and run for your life
Follow my voice
I'm the only one that's gonna survive
The only one that's gonna survive
