Tight places, love.
CONSTANTINE 01x01 - Pilot
English subtitles: Praveen Nautie
You witnessed the murder of a girl.
Talking will help you to understand that it is not your fault.
That would be a beauty. Let's just get this part.
Start telling me what happened that night in Newcastle.
- Do you remember the killer? - I see that devil every time I close my eyes.
- With "demon" you mean "killer". - With 'devil' I mean , shit.
Disgusting creature. It smells like a butcher.
Look what happens, John. You feel guilty for failing to protect the girl, then ...
You make killer in this incarnation of evil.
We are all powerless against demons.
- Not all, boss. - Ah, yes ...
Before interning here three months ago, you worked as an exorcist, demonologist ...
- "Master of the Occult Arts"? - It says master, right?
I should switch to "amateur paltry". I hate to brag.
- Well, you did not stop the girl's death. - "Astra".
Her name was Astra.
Do not care about his death. It is his conviction that drives me to despair.
- Dragged to Hell ... - John, it's time to face the truth.
Nine years, suffering for eternity.
- Only those who suffer here is you. - It's my fault, man.
- There are no demons. - You already said!
Now make me believe it.
That's what I paid you, is not it?
I want to be able to stop to do my rituals.
If I make a cup of tea I move nine times.
Here I am nine minutes to drink, so I sit for nine minutes.
Everything always in multiples of nine, you know?
But today ...
Today I stopped doing the ritual, and nothing horrible happened.
Only Mexican tea once.
Girl? Whatever you are painting here, better stop now.
Girl?
No. No, no, no ...
That's not my problem.
Shit ...
I turn to the entity inside. Who are you? Say your name.
Listen to me!
In the name of the Creator, I command you to leave this place!
By the Blood of Man, disappear now!
Do not worry, love. It's just paint.
- What happened? - A spirit took her borrowed body.
To send me a message, apparently.
- What does it mean? - What I've been wasting my time here.
I have work to do.
She who did this.
Who has a better future: me, or the girl above, the cafeteria?
- The girl above. - What?
Faculty serves to it. Give me a fortune cookie?
Does it bother you people living adventures in cars who rent from us?
Everything we do is wash windows and seek scratches. I want it to scratch me.
"Failure is an opportunity to do better next time."
- "In bed." - What?
- You always put "in bed" at the end. - Oh really?
- We read your. - Okay ..
Is blank. Great, I have no future.
Takes one to eat on the road.
- THX. - See you tomorrow. Do not forget to lock up.
- Bye, Liv. - See you later!
Oh my God!
Well, well! What have we here? Is in trouble, doll?
- Get back! - My name is John Constantine.
This is the opposite side.
- I swear, I'm not standing behind you. - What are you talking about? Who is behind me?
It is possibly the "what", not "who".
Stay away. Go back ... Stop! Do not approach.
It is easier to ignore than to face the danger, but make no mistake:
If you do not listen to me, will be dead by morning.
I'll call the police.
If you're so determined to call the authorities ... They can find me here.
Or you can, if you like breathing.
"Master of the occult arts" ...?
I'll make new cards.
Whoever it is, I'm a pretty nasty guy! Ask anyone.
- You should not be down here. - I can say the same for you.
- This here is the work of mining. - That's what I'm doing.
- What brings you back to the streets, John? - The girl, of course.
- An old friend asked me to protect her. - Must be a dead friend.
He made the request after owning a body, but could my attention.
- Who are you? - You can call me Manny.
- I was told to take care of you. - "Take care of me"?
No offense, sir, I do not want angels on my ass. That would spoil my reputation.
- Hospice too. - Is it? Have I left. I'm great.
Hear that? I'm fine!
- Bate wings here. - You're not fine, John.
You ordered a girl to Hell. Along with your soul.
Now, I can not change your destiny, but can reduce their suffering.
- It will take advantage of the defeat of another will. - Their is estraordin√°ria!
Do not worry about me, mate. I can handle an attack of the devil.
I'm not so sure. You spent time out of the game.
It has a lot of panic here. People feel what's coming.
And what is coming?
We should go.
Wait!
What is coming?
- You saved my life.
- No problem, I work five minutes away.
Thank you, Talia. I really appreciate the ride.
I'm just glad you dodged that crazy.
It looked like a rapist.
- Yeah, really scared me.
- You sure you're okay?
I'm fine, thanks.
Has plans for later?
- Sleep well. - You too, good night.
- Stay in the apartment, girl. - What's up?
This is a crime scene.
Oh my god, Talia ...
Talia ...
What the fuck ...?
Calm! I'll get you there.
- Thanks for the ride. - Be careful.
You always go to the police?
My friend was killed last night.
Sorry about that.
I found on my door. What is it?
The Eye of Horus.
Egyptian symbol of protection, so they say.
There was a man in the hallway
yesterday. I think he killed Talia.
Liv, meet Chas. My oldest friend.
He who has the symbol, which kept you alive.
- I'm glad you're okay.
- He does not talk much.
Now, to business.
If we do not get you to a safe place,
the bodies will keep appearing.
Why would anyone want to kill me? I am a nobody.
I hate to end your happiness but you is not nobody.
I met his father, Jasper Winters.
I promised him I would take care of you.
This is not possible.
My father died before I was born.
Who told you that was lying.
Jasper died last year.
He was a good man.
So there you go.
Abra. Belonged to him. He wanted you to have this.
- Everybody out! Chas, take them here.
- Come out!
That was my table.
I should be sitting here.
Who is behind you can track you,
feel your energy.
Will not give up until you are dead.
- Oh my God! Talia ...?
- She's alive! - Is not. Something is using it.
It's all wrong. They never act so openly.
Who are you? Who sent you?
- Liv? - Gone.
Wonder.
Mother, look into my eyes and say it again: when my father died?
I'm not ready for that conversation.
You deprived me of it my whole life.
I do not care if you do not want to talk now.
- Who was he?
- He was just a guy.
I met him at a show.
He did not want to see you after you were born.
And God knows that his grandmother
- God rest her
- did not encourage it.
- A friend of his found me.
- Do not know how, Jasper did not know where we lived.
The man I met said it was his.
Have you seen this before?
Liv ...? What?
Grandma ...
Liv! Dear! What happened?
- What is happening to me?
- Are you waking up. Seeing the world as it is.
- As your father.
- That means what?
Holy impatience! The disease of the twenty-first century.
Where's the necklace?
Look around.
- What are they? - Souls. Trapped, looking for an exit.
- You see them? - No.
What else do you see?
- There's a train coming. - It is?
What r u doing? Comes a train! Let me go!
What you 'doin? The train is coming!
We have to go off the rails! Let me go, let me go!
- What happened? - A ghost train.
The more involved the dead, but are vivid visions.
- All this is impossible.
- Deny will not make it go away.
- How can I see these things?
- Sounds like you have the gift of his father.
When you touch the pendant,
you concentrate your skill and see what he saw.
There are worlds beyond our own. Plans of parallel existence.
Entities between us ... Jasper could see it all.
He tried to teach me, but ...
- I had no talent. - You said you were coming.
We can talk later. Now, we are the prey.
Leave your car for your mother, you come with us.
John would tell me about Jasper. I want to know how he died.
In Ragley.
- Were you there? - Enough.
Just thought what's behind me might want revenge for something that my father did.
I do not care why.
I just want to send it back and pay off my debt to his father.
- Turn it off. - I can not.
Chas!
- John ...? - Astra?
Who is following me? Does it go away! Please!
Come here, I'll protect you.
- You will not catch her!
- You can not save her ...
- Do not go! You will not get it! - John! Get me out of here!
- No. ..! - John!
John, get us out of here! Help us!
John helps us! My foot is stuck!
- Do something, please! - Okay, calm down!
The Santa Cruz commands you!
The Star of David commands you!
The Lord commands you: Get out of this place!
Exit this place
Disappear now!
I think I caught him. Come forth, Chas!
The Lord commands you. The Lord commands you.
The Lord commands you!
Chas, beware!
- No. ..! - Do not!
There are millions of demons.
We have to figure out which one you want dead.
- Do not worry, you're safe here.
- 'You're kidding! After what happened to Chas?
Things are not what they seem, love. If you want to get out of this alive, need to understand.
I do not understand half of what he says! You say something clararamente?
This house belonged to his father. If that day came ...
I promised I would put those keys in your hands.
Clear enough for you?
Jasper said I should take care of you. He had to keep away ...
- For your safety, naturally. - There is nothing natural about it.
This is crazy! Can you survive an apocalypse down here.
It is, or start one. Jasper used this place for divination.
Nobody found trouble faster than his father. Literally.
Put it there, love, before he "lower" you.
This looks like a map of Atlanta. What are these places?
- "Cascade of Illusions"? - Jasper called "mapping".
He started drawing the map itself, with things he saw.
- You said he thought trouble? - Divination with Crystals.
Place the pendant over a map for you to see.
Ah, here it is!
I thought the demon that is hunting you. Goes by the name Furcifer.
That bastard angel was right. The stakes are rising.
- What angel? - Nevertheless, Keep your eyes on the map.
Furcifer draws its power from electricity.
Can manifest in lightning and storms.
In addition to controlling power lines, and ... dead bodies.
I still do not understand why.
You are a threat to the darkness that is rising.
Now you can see these things, they can see you.
Most of them do not like to be seen.
Eleminar you are a precaution.
- Ouch! - Secure! Let the blood drip.
- My god, what is this? - What you asked: trouble.
What blood showed?
Edgewood Avenue. And then have something bad going on there?
Will happen. It is day now.
Most things that its powers located hunts at night.
- We should tell someone. - Not exactly have a service for this, right?
- We have to do something. - We're making. Keeping you alive.
I have an idea to end what is attacking you, but ...
- Means to use you as bait. - Why do you feel now 'doin' that?
I have a contact at the University of Ivy that can help. Just be quiet until I get back.
Can I help you, sir?
You know, there's a line between t√™nua take charge and pursue.
I was right, right? Crazy down here.
Can you open the door, please? My time is precious.
That's new.
- He discovered that the girl is hunting? - A demon elite.
Oh really ...?
And you think something can come here without much help?
Sounds like you want me to find out some information.
- I want to. - How come?
We're here from the beginning, John. Beginning of time.
We were put here to guide the evolution of the human spirit.
An invisible hand on his shoulder a whisper in the wind ...
- Not the most efficient way. - You want to do everything with their own hands.
Escorradio way, friend.
- That's what the First of the Fallen did. - For different purposes.
Listen. If you find out what we are facing,
I will use this information to save lives.
And my life? You condemned me to Hell.
Why should I risk my last days on Earth ...
Why, indeed? You are a sideshow.
- A vendedorzinho cheap magic. - Whoa there ...
Your decisions are questionable and without any conscience.
Why should you risk your spare time?
Because you are doomed to Hell.
At least so far.
Are you suggesting that it is not too late to save my soul?
All right, sir?
No.
Not a bit.
Hello, Ritchie.
- Right on time, no? - I ask you, please ...
- Get out of my office now! Break out! - Is that any way to treat a friend?
You know what, forget it. Stay, I walk.
Continues  the internet with things that appear at night.
A celestiam be said that something big is coming.
If I tell you, will you leave?
Right. Yes, yes, I have seen a lot of unexplained fem√¥menos.
Police reports, chat groups, news channels ...
And I can assure you, things are coming out of the shadows in a way we've never seen, John.
Never.
This includes a walking demon terrorizing the daughter of Jasper?
I need your help, Simpson. Can you hack a network of energy?
Yes, I can do it, and I step. Thank you very much.
- Richie, I know it was crazy ... Nescastle - Newcastle was a nightmare, John! A nightmare!
Whatever happened with that girl ... And you know what?
I do not go a day without sleeping pills, pain medication.
I just get out of bed by my dangerous friend, amphetamine!
- All learned the lesson. - We learn. And my lesson?
My lesson was painful to do everything to get away from you.
You know, the cops Newcastle still looking for the man who killed Astra.
- You know it was not a man. - But they do not.
It would be a pity if someone said that you were there.
It's not like you had an alibi for that night.
It should have been you, John.
Seriously, I just wish that the girl had escaped and the thing caught you.
Yeah, we two.
Santa ...?
- Do not cry, I brought food. - I saw a man in the mirror in the fireplace.
- Yep ..? - Jasper? Seems so.
- His ghost? - No.
The weather is confused in that mirror. You watched the past.
You will find so many dangerous things in this place.
Here, brought clothes for you.
- How did you get into my apartment? - Liv?
- I'm fine. Sorry to scare you. - But you ...
- You died. - Not exactly, it's ... complicated.
Has a reason to be Chas my oldest friend.
It has ability to survive.
No, no one can survive what I saw.
Excellent. If you're not confused, you are not paying attention.
Now, his famous grilled lamb. Do not face the demons on an empty stomach.
- Wait, go after him tonight? - "Live the present," is what I say.
Three hundred, four hundred ... five hundred dollars.
Only to have sex on the roof?
- Come on! - She ''re on fire, huh.
One more detail worth a hundred dollars.
Keep your hand. If you delete, you call me.
- Do not want to get into any of that. - Neither do I, friend.
Just keep an eye out and call me. You have my cell number.
- What is it? - Demonic Seal.
You found on the internet?
No, this is patented.
The Triangle of Solomon, with some ancient runes and Enochian alphabet.
When it arrives, you have to enter the circle.
The label will handle it, and I can send him to hell.
This should work.
It's time. Enter the circle.
No, no! It's my highest score.
- Where are you from, John? - The passion of my parents.
- You do that a lot. - Do what?
- Hides emotions with humor. - I do, is it?
A strange mood, which makes me wonder if you're a sociopath.
Sorry if I do not drown in my feelings, I believe in repressing the past.
- What matters is where we are. - Do not believe it.
You risked your life to convince me that my past is important.
Come on, John, I'm trusting you with my life.
The least you can do is to share some personal detail.
My mother died at my birth.
It is a great detail.
My father said it was my fault.
He had a nickname for me, I heard all night.
"Hello, killer!"
And every night since then he gave me a punch in the head and said:
"This is for what you did with your mother, murderer".
- You imagine how his mother was? - There's no point imagining. I'll find it.
As a teenager, I started reading every book he could find on the occult.
I learned spells, rituals, curses ... I learned to rely on dead things.
But her.
Not yet.
If you can summon people, may invoke my father?
You would not like the outcome.
Prepare yourself.
- I told you to call me. - Do not you wanna stay here.
Oh, he wants to, yes.
Not the guard.
Stay there, Liv.
You killed that good man. I should have foreseen this.
You want it, boss? Come and get it.
If you insist ...
Nergal said in its ritual power lack of intent.
Liv, run!
John!
Thought he could ambush me? That could use electricity?
Night ...
In this place I am a God.
That reminds me.
I almost forgot.
Hope it works, John ...
- What happened? - "Power of intention."
Let me out, John. I release the soul of the Astra.
As if you could ...
John, are you?
- Astra ...? - John!
I wanna go home ... take me home!
Release me, and her soul will be free.
John, I'm afraid!
Stop John, is not the Astra. Not her.
I'm afraid ...
Think you can control my life? I got news for you, pal!
I'm behind the Astra. I go after Nergal.
Can pass it on, in Hell.
Ex hoc
John!
You 'okay?
Have a friend down there will take you home.
Go!
Who is Astra?
She was the daughter of a friend of ours in Newcastle, England.
Was possessed by a demon. John made his way ...
Invoked an even more powerful demon.
- Nergal? - He said he would ...
Order him to take away the lowest demon.
- But he was led Astra? - It's ...
After ripping it to pieces in front of us.
Look, even John believes he has everything under control.
Do you believe that. It's the "magic" of it.
But also his curse.
If I were you, I'd stay away from him, Liv.
I can not tell you that, but he wanted his father had said.
This is the Edgewood Avenue.
John told me to use the crystal that avenue today and appeared on the map.
Stop, stop the car.
Let me go, let me go! What ...?
Who would ... Who would ...?
Who would do that to a kid ...?
A teenager was killed tonight. On Edgewood Avenue.
We knew something was going to happen and I could not stop!
Forget this philosophy, that will leave you crazy.
Or we can save innocent lives!
I have to find out if anyone else is having problems.
I went to the library, I used the guessing game with the crystal and look:
It is happening everywhere!
Accept advice: go back to the rental car, living in a hole hobbit.
- It will keep you safe. - I do not care to be sure!
Not with people dying! I need to find these people and prevent, as my father. But ...
- I can not do this alone. - You're sniffing the wrong post.
I paid my debt to your father, you're alive.
If you will not do for them, make the Astra.
- Write her loss worthwhile. - I'll think about it.
Thanks, buddy.
Congratulations. You made her believe that it was all her idea.
Easy. Was difficult to convince Richie to divert ten blocks up the avenue.
- Why did not you help her? - She does not trust me.
It had to be her idea.
A pity. That man in Edgewood Avenia lost his life.
"Sorrow" is what I face every day.
Liv and the boy would die tonight.
I could only save one.
So ... you're going to hell ...
You will find that kind of strength we are facing.
- It's what you wanted, right? - I have to ask ...
You are doing it to save lives ... Or save your miserable soul?
It's a trick question. I will not answer.
Pays the bill? I owe the bastard ''re ignoring me.
