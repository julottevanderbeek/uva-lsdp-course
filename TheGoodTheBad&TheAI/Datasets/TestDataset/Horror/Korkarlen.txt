The Phantom Carriage
A tale told in livlng plctures
under the directlon of Victor Sjöström
At the camera: J. Jullus
Once there was a poor
Salvation Army sister at death's door.
She was stricken with
galloplng consumptlon,
and she had only held out
for the space of a year.
When there was no hope left
she had gone home to her mother.
Waiting at the foot of her bed
was another Salvation Army sister
who had once
worked alongside the sick girl.
"Don't fret over those
poor souls now, Sister Edit."
"You have done enough for them."
"Send for David Holm!"
"Please don't! My daughter was yours
as long as she had a spark of life."
"Let me have her to myself
now that she ls dylng."
"Slster Maria, why don't you
do as I ask? Send for David Holm!"
"l shall go fetch hlm at once."
"You can't be serious, asklng
David Holm to attend a death bed?"
"l haven't been able to find him,
but Gustavsson is looking too."
"He will bring him here
if that is at all possible."
"Poor Mrs Holm Poor Mrs Holm"
"l'll take her back home."
"lt wouldn't do for her husband
to see her should he come."
The evenlng on which these events took
place was not an ordinary one.
lt was New Year's Eve.
"Well, we will certainly know
when it's time to toast the New Year!"
"lt's a spooky place to await midnight,
here among the dead."
"You gentlemen
are not afraid of ghosts, l hope?"
"Then I'd like to tell you a story
while we wait for the midnight hour."
"l once had a pal called Georges,
who was generally a jolly fellow."
"He came of a good famlly, and had
studied hard at Uppsala University,
so he knew a bit more
than the rest of us."
"But a change would come over hlm
on New Year's Eve."
"Remember that it's New Year's Eve,
the last day of the year!"
"Whoever dies on this eve
must drive the cart of death."
"There is an old, old cart..."
no ordinary driver holds the reigns."
"He is in the service of a strict master
named Death."
"For him, a single night
is as long as 100 years on Earth."
"Night and day he must carry out
his master's business."

"Wherever he goes,
he is greeted with sorrow and despair."
"There is no escape
He must perform his sorry duty."
"Although the horse and cart
remain the same, the driver will vary."
"The last soul to die each year,
the one who gives up the ghost
at the stroke of midnight,
is destined to be Death's driver
during the coming year."
"Now you know why i'm afraid
of something fatal happening
on New Year's Eve."
"And the odd thing is, you see,
that Georges apparently died
last New Year's Eve."
"Why hasn't Gustavsson arrived
with David Holm?"
"Come with me, David Holm"
"Sister Edit is dying
and she has asked for you."
"lf Sister Edit wants to see you,
you must go at once!"
"David, l can't believe it's you!
You are meant to relieve me!"
"You ought to lift me up ln your cart
and take me to the hospital."
"No living soul rides ln this cart."
"By the time l arrive
it is too late for a doctor."
"You know well enough
that l am no longer alive."
"But, worst of all,
you must face the consequences
of the evil you have wrought
during your lifetime."
"David, do you think i'm unaware
that it is my fault
you have met such an end?"
"lf you hadn't fallen in with me
you would have led a good life
with your wife, children and brother."
"By tomorrow you will have served
your time for drunken behaviour."
"But before you leave,
a harsher punishment awaits you."
"Behold, your brother."
"While you were here
he killed a man while intoxicated,
and now a long prison term awaits."
"But we feel that you ought
to serve the sentence instead,
since you and you alone led him astray,
and made him a killer."
"Does this not make you turn from
your wicked ways, David Holm?"
"Yes, for only now do l realise
how it feels to have brought great
misery upon a loved one."
"What about your wife and children?"
"l know how miserable they felt,
but l will turn over a new leaf."

"No, she is not ill."
"She was well enough
the other day, when she left."
"And here l was thinklng l would
come home to her with such joy!"
"lf she had gone openly,
I would have understood,
but to slink off like that,
to let me come home
to an empty house,
that was heartless!"
"l'll wipe those smiles off your faces."
"l'll find her, and l'll teach her how it feels
when your heart freezes
to its very core, like mine has!"
"l'll refrain from reminding you
of your search for your wife,
during which your feelings
of hatred and revenge waxed stronger."
"l will take you to a time a year ago,
to last New Year's Eve,
when you came here,
bringing such misfortune in your wake."
"A Salvation Army station
had been set up here in town."
"And it was ready for use
on New Year's Eve."
"Keep your food!
l only want to sleep."
"Leave it be! lt may be full of germs!"
"We don't have
the sterilislng oven going yet."
"Don't you realise, Maria,
how it pleases me
to help the first guest God sent us?"
"Please, go to bed. lt's been a busy day."
"Let me attend to thls."
"Dear Jesus, let our first guest
be blessed with a happy year."
All nlght long she bent over the coat,
never giving thought
to the germs she had inhaled."
"By the time she went to bed
the chill of winter
had thoroughly penetrated the room."
"Did you mend my coat?"
"Would you mind fetching
the person who did this?"
"lt's a shame
you went to all that trouble, Miss,
but i'm used to having it like this."
"Before you leave, l'd like to ask you
to visit me next New Year's Eve."
"You see, l prayed that our first guest
would have a good year."
"And l wanted to find out
if my prayers were answered."
"Oh, l'll be here."
"l'll come to show you God
didn't give a fig for you or your twaddle."
"The time has come to honour
that promise before you take over here."
"From you she contracted the disease
that ends her life,
and now she awaits your visit."
"You have possessed
all that is most wonderful,
but you have lost it!"
"You cannot avold
the torment or remorse,
just as you cannot escape taking over
as Death's driver for a year."
"Captive, take leave of thy prison!"
"Ye spirit that left thy body
at the stroke of midnight,
thou wilt relieve me of my office."
"For a year thou wilt reap souls."

"lt is Death, but too soon."
"You see that i'm not afraid of you."
"l will gladly heed your summons,
but grant me a day's grace,
for there is someone
l must talk sense into."
"You do not know
what terrible misfortune l have caused."
"l cannot approach the Lord
before l have put it right."
"l must tell you that the person
i'm waitlng for is the man l love.
"Do you understand? The man l love!"
"l would grant you grace
if it would avail you,
but you have no power over this man."
"You have tried
to make him mend his ways,
believing he was good,
but your hopes have been dashed
time and time again."
"You're the one who enticed him
away from his home and his work!"
"You made him the drunkard he is!"
"Don't let yourself be dragged under!"

"Run along and be saved, and
upon my soul i'll come and watch you!"
"What's the use of making such a fuss?"
"l'm a consumptive,
but l cough into people's faces
in the hope of finlshlng them off."
"Why should they be better than us?"
"He's merely amusing hlmself. He's
not as wicked as he pretends to be."
"How can you be filled with
such bitter hatred for your fellow man?"
"You needn't worry about that.
l'll be leavlng town in a few days."
"No, you mustn't do that!"
"l would rather you stayed
so l may challenge you again."
"However tempting that maybe,
I still can't stay."
"You see, little missy,
i'm on a journey throughout Sweden,
in search of a person
l must find at all costs."
"Who ls this person you seek?"
"You'll know that
when l find the person in question"
"l am the one
David Holm is looking for."
"l am his wife."
"l couldn't endure the life he led."
"I deserted him, took my children
and crept away in secret."
"l moved to this town
for it was so far from our old home,
that I never expected him
to come looking for me here."
"You must take him back!
lt's his only hope!"
"l didn't mean that you must
make up your mind on the spot,
but promise me to listen to your heart,
and we can talk again."
She had got the better of herself
and asked for none of the thlngs
that belonged to this world.
"Just come with me! A surprise awaits
that will make you happy."

She wanted to replant the seed
that had fallen among the thorns,
and she may well have gained her end
had it not been that...
"The doctor says it's pneumonia."
"Her resistance is so poor
for she has had ill health
ever since last New Year's Eve."
"Yes, this David Holm
has been her undoing."
"She worries so about the situation
between him and his wife,
but she mustn't know the truth."
"You might at least have the heart
to spare the children from infection!"
"lt wasn't as easy to run away this time!"
"Haven't you had enough revenge?"
"lf only l hadn't
brought them together again!"
"His sin would be of less magnitude
if not for me."
"You must grant me grace!
l cannot die yet!"
"l must see him turn over a new leaf!.
Just spare me a few minutes!"
"You know l love him.
l've never loved him as l do today."
"Captive, ye of loving heart,
take leave of thy prison."
"Come along.
There ls nothing for us to do here."
"Those who are to receive her
will arrive shortly."
"You know, David, if l could send
a message to humanklnd,
"l would like to send them
a New Year's greeting."
"l would like them to dwell
on a single New Year's prayer."
"Lord, please let my soul come
to maturity before it is reaped."
"Why are we here?
Surely no one here is going to die!"
"No, l can't go on. l can't go on!"
"l'm sorry, but l must go away,
and l cannot leave them behind."
"Please don't be angry with me.
lt's not my fault."
"This will do, David. It will suffice
for the children and myself."
"Yes, David, l see what's coming."
"l'm obilged to watch.
l do not shirk my duty."
"You mustn't let it happen!
Thls mustn't come to pass!"
"Don't let those poor,
innocent creatures die!"
"l have no power over the living."
"Where shall l turn?"
"Should l pray to God or to Jesus?
Who can tell me
where to direct my plea?"
"l'm a poor, miserable sinner,
I beseech thee Lord of life and Death!"
"l'm not worthy,
l've broken your every commandment."
"Sentence me to eternal night!"
"Let nothing remain of me!"
"Do what you like to me, my Lord,
only spare the three of them!"
"David, l see that l no longer
need to grieve for you!"
"She hasn't done it yet.
l made it here in tlme!"
"Sister Edit is dead,
and l have been at her side."
"l promised her to become
a good husband and father."
"You're lying! Sister Maria
told me you refused to go to her."
"Are you crying, David?"
"No one believes l want to reform."
"l want to be good, but no one
believes me. ls it any wonder l cry?"
"lt's hard to believe, David."
"But l do believe you.
Your tears convinced me."
"l can't help crying too."
"l won't be truly happy
until my sorrow is drained."
"Lord, please let my soul
come to maturity before it ls reaped."
