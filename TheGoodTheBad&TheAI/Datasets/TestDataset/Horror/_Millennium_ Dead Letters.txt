And Stop!
Where's Jordan?
Where's Jordan?
Daddy?
Daddy?
- What's the matter, honey?
- I had a bad dream.
Oh. Come on.
Everybody has bad dreams.
Why?
Everything's been left as we found it.
We covered the victim, but the perpetrator
covered his own fecal remains.
Hair and fiber are gonna be a mess.
There's tons of animal fur around.
- We started dusting already.
- Did you find a message?
On the body.
Or cut into the skin.
There are those in the Group who believe
we shouldn't take the case in Portland.
- Some are unconvinced the subject will kill again.
- He will.
Others think we should wait,
applying the Holmes criteria...
defining serial killers
involving three victims...
with a time period between
murders of at least 30 days.
He won't wait.
He'll kill again.
Ten days.
A week, maybe.
Frank, with the hundreds of cases
we're being asked to consult on...
and all the smaller
law enforcement agencies that need us...
why should the Group
send you down there?
He left a message.
I'm certain of it.
There was no report
of any message.
It's there.
I just haven't found it.
Okay. Portland detectives
called us in on this.
But for their crime stats,
they'll want to get the credit.
There's a man down there
that's worked with Portland P.D., Jim Horn.
we're considering him
for the Group.
He's had extensive background
in behavioral science...
and his work was
directly responsible...
for finding the Highway 8 Killer
in San Diego.
He's a real good guy. Works out
of an office in downtown Portland.
We're sorry.
The number you have dialed is incorrect.
- Please check the number--
- How the hell could it be incorrect?
It's my number.
If you'd like to speak
with a service representative...
enter ``1 '' now.
All our representatives are busy.
If you wish to hold, your call will be
answered in the order it was received.
The current waiting period is 45 minutes.
That's how long I've been
dealing with you, you mechanical--
Jim Horn?
Frank Black.
Welcome to Portland, Frank.
Heard great things about you
from Steve Choleski at I.S.U.
Have a seat.
- Coffee?
- Thanks.
I don't want to come off
like a jerk, but...
I go by ''James'' now.
Okay, James.
Thanks.
It's no big thing.
You profiling me?
You got that look
like you're profiling me.
No, James.
Just wondering what's wrong.
Sorry.
My wife and I are going
through a separation, and, uh--
I had to disconnect
the fax line out at the house...
and the phone company--
Man.
They can make you feel
like a worthless ass.
Sorry to hear
about your wife.
I see you have a kid.
Me too.
That's my boy, T.e.
just turned two.
I've never been separated.
I hear it's rough.
Yeah. This work--
Makes things hard,
you know?
I've been there.
Uh, Jim Penseyres
sent down the stuff last night.
I hope you don't mind,
but I sketched out a rough profile.
- I'm very interested.
- jim tells me you think
there might be a triggering stressor.
I couldn't agree more.
Divorce, maybe.
He's never married.
Never had sex.
You get that from there being no sexual
mutilation or intercourse with the victim?
It appears that the murder created a charged
psychological release in the killer...
but the only physiological release
he could perform was defecation.
I read those remains as a signature
of his hatred for women.
The defecation was covered.
He was embarrassed by it.
They haven't identified the victim yet,
but I believe he knew her.
- Why's that?
- The duct tape.
He objectified her, but he took the care
to cover just the face...
not the entire head.
He wanted as much
of his obsession visible as possible...
but he couldn't
have her looking at him.
Couldn't hear her fear.
That's an indication
of remorse.
It's rare to have remorse
for a stranger.
I'd expect him to visit
the victim's grave site...
tell her how bad he feels.
Well, I admit
I can't get a fix...
on why the staging of the body
in the animal shelter.
There could be
a hundred reasons.
Well, that will be
answered by his message.
You mean the message in the way
he posed the victim? Cutting the body in two?
Well, he takes something from the victims,
but leaves something of himself behind.
- Like what?
- He left a written message.
There was no message
at the crime scene or on the victim.
- We'll go find it.
- You're sure about this?
Yes, I am.
Frank, I'm gonna be
right up front about this.
I've heard a lot
about you. A lot.
And don't get me wrong.
I have the utmost respect for your work.
But I gotta tell ya...
I'm doubtful about some of the things
I've heard about you.
That's all right, James.
I've been there too.
The girl was Karen Anderson, 21.
Parking enforcement officer.
Just moved up from Northern California.
No boyfriend. Attractive.
Everyone says real friendly.
Her uniform was found in a sanitation
transfer station down in Oregon eity.
Blood stains
and fabric tearing confirmed...
he dismembered her while
she was still wearing the uniform.
That may have been how he had prior contact
with her. Simple. She gave him a ticket.
We can go over the parking tickets
she issued in the last week...
see if any of the violations
fit the subject.
Come on, Frank!
Work with me!
we've got evidence here
that is... here!
In hand!
If you're so focused on looking
for some specific message that isn't there...
you're going to overlook
the obvious signatures.
Come on, Frank.
You got a problem with me, let's hear it.
Down this way.
Tape.
Acetate.
``Hair today--''
``Hair today,
gone tomorrow.''
These messages
are a big '`up yours''to the police.
He dared us to find it.
Thought we'd be too stupid.
The guy definitely knew
we'd search for hair and fiber.
A police freak.
Feels superior to us.
Might even be an ex-cop.
Older.
The hairs are gray.
But if this guy's that smart, he's getting
the hairs from another individual.
Maybe this person's
connected to the two women.
Maybe that's how he had
prior contact with the victims.
I can't shake the feeling
he's had prior contact, Frank.
Something in my head,
something in my subconscious is telling me--
When I look at the victims...
when I look at their faces...
- all I can see-
- Daddy! Daddy!
- T.C., get out! Get out of here!
- Jim, stop it!
He couldn't wait all week
to see you, and now--
Damn it. You know how I feel
about him ever seeing those.
That's why I told him
to get out!
You knew I was dropping him off.
You should have taken them down.
- I said 4:00.
- He wanted to surprise you.
Look...
if you're working and you can't
spend some time with him--
Don't start.
Of course I want to see him.
eome here, buddy.
I'm really gonna need
your focus on this, James.
Look, this is
my weekend with T.C.
But I realize
there are lives on the line.
Maybe if you
got away from here.
Maybe a step back will help you
take a step forward.
The subject is in custody.
Man, I can't breathe.
I can feel. I can see that...
when focused,
when removed...
he's actually
a very good asset.
A good man too.
Why don't you tell him?
Where he's at right now,
he'd never hear me.
You're different people, Frank...
at different places
and times.
Just because you didn't
hear me back then...
doesn't mean
he won't hear you now.
Mmm.
- Come on, boy.
- Hey, T.e., wanna use this one?
How do you like your hamburger, James?
Medium? Rare?
- James?
- Hmm?
Oh, uh, medium's fine, thanks.
They play well together.
Yeah. It's great to watch 'em, huh?
They have no idea...
the things we see...
the things we know
are out there.
I hope I'm not
screwin' him up.
I never ever dreamed...
at that perfect moment that...
my time with him would be
regulated by petitions...
attorney retainers,
orders of the court.
That mother, father and son would
become nothing but a case number.
That, as a father, I risk adding
nothing to his life.
I could become nothing but...
a face covered in gray tape.
When I read Dostoyevsky,
there was a passage--
Something like, there is nothing
more sad...
than a life that ends,
and no one knows or cares.
``Hair today,
gone tomorrow.''
The subject is angry
that his life will go unnoticed...
that he will have
left nothing.
The hatred of himself
is directed toward the world...
which has held him back
because it objectified him...
reduced him, reduced us all
to universal bar codes.
We are animals
in a caged shelter...
controlled by dogcatchers.
The gray tape makes the victims
look like how he feels--
Faceless.
A dead letter lost
at the post office.
He's killed before,
when he was young.
Most likely,
a female prostitute.
After an early setback--
a girlfriend, a job--
he sought out a woman
that wouldn't turn him away.
The solicitation increased
his feelings of nothingness...
and so he killed her
before sex.
My guess--
He was never caught.
He got away with it.
The subject has felt guilt
ever since.
Angered at a world that should
have punished him, but didn't.
The murder, however,
was the most significant event in his life.
He's returned to this place,
to the event.
He wants nothing more
than to be stopped.
But he will do everything
in his control to remain significant.
'`You monkeys, you, ''he said,
shaking his finger at them.
``Give me back my caps.''
So, the monkeys are shaking
their fingers back at the peddler saying...
``Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.''
Daddy, can I sleep
in your bed tonight?
No. You're having a sleepover.
- The monkeys will get me.
- These monkeys? Nah. No.
- If I have a bad dream--
- If I have a bad dream.
If you feel like you're gonna have
a bad dream, you will.
But if you think you're gonna have
a good dream, you'll have a good dream too.
Do you know
all about bad dreams?
I know enough about bad dreams
to keep them from you...
and T.e.
Say your prayers.
When I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
- If I should die before I wake...
- Yeah.
- Both your daddies need 'em.
- I pray the Lord my soul to take.
I don't know, Catherine.
Maybe it's because T.C.'s been
taken out of my everyday life.
Or...
he's two now, and he's becoming
a person, you know?
But I can't--
These murderers--
Before, they were a...
fascinating psychological,
societal puzzle.
Most I could even feel sympathy for 'em,
because of their horrible lives.
But now...
when I walk
into a crime scene...
all I see is my little boy's face
superimposed on the victim.
And--
And these killers
can't be simply cases...
or psychological anomalies anymore.
They're just...
monsters.
Just monsters.
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah.
My car's just over here.
Good night.
Help!
Help!
You okay over there?
Oh- Yeah. It's just-
My glasses fell off when I tried
to shut the door with my arms full.
And I ca--
Don't worry.
I-I'll find them. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Uh, I--
They should be near the door.
I didn't really feel them fly too far off.
Oh--
Here they are.
He's feeling more confident.
How do you know that?
He killed the woman in the same location
he disposed of the body.
No. Security guard reported
nothing out of the ordinary.
Crime scene team found no evidence
the murder occurred here.
The blood spatter patterns are moving away
from the scene, not arriving at it.
A mobile slaughterhouse.
He would need room to work.
- Probably a van.
- Mm-hmm.
Left lens.
Partial print.
My guess it's from
the victim.
We can check the prescription.
Notify optometrists in the city.
He's too smart. He'd use one of those
one hour places outside of town.
A place where he could go unnoticed.
mr. Black?
That's it?
This son of a bitch
too bored with our progress?
He thinks we're not enough
of a challenge?
You show your frustration
in front of them, and he's gonna know.
It does us no good now to get mad
about what he thinks or wants.
We can only use it
to find him.
He wants a challenge.
Let's give him one.
Can't believe
he didn't bite.
Still might.
Ah, it'll be light in an hour.
He'll never do it then.
I say we give him
his opportunity now.
All units, this is Charlie One.
Okay, we're going to
'`drain the weasel. ''
Whenever you're ready,
Alpha One.
I copy.
All units,
suspect approaching.
Take him!
Whoa.
Are you a patient here?
- If I knew you were this strict,
I wouldn't have left my room.
- What are you doing?
Marjorie was my nurse.
I just wanted to pay my respects.
But my doctor wouldn't let me.
- It took me this long to sneak out.
- Yeah.
- Take him back to his room.
- It's okay. It's okay. eome on.
There's a patient here.
I thought it was the guy.
We all did.
What if it was, James?
Is bouncing the subject's head
off the hood of the car...
gonna do anything to change all
the other murders that will occur today?
Come on, Frank! Some guy cut your wife
and your daughter into eight pieces...
and you just stand there
and read him his rights?
He hasn't killed our wives or our families,
and he's not going to.
If you make every one of these personal,
you'll go insane.
And that's from having
been there, James.
I get so far into the heads
of the killers and the victims.
- You haven't got there at all.
- Don't you tell me where I am!
You put them in your head.
I keep reliving...
what it's like
to be cut in half...
or four or eight.
This isn't about you, James.
The whole thing.
What's goin' on out here.
It's about us.
Me. You.
The killer
and the victim.
I can't help
but take this personally.
Another person is
going to die, horribly...
because Is--
we screwed up.
I-- we did all this
for nothing.
No, we didn't.
We handed out 30 pins
from the hospital charity to be placed here.
There's 31 .
We wanted one taken,
but one was left.
He was here.
The flyers with the suspects
fitting our profile from the memorial...
have been dispatched to optometrists
and eyeglass labs around the area.
Plus, a resident four blocks
from the hospital...
recalls seeing an orange van driving around
the area the night of the memorial.
Yeah.
A saleslady from one of those
eyeglass places in Woodburn...
- recalls one of the suspects from the flyer.
- Which one did she recall?
- This guy.
- Are you sure?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I remember.
He was a total ass.
- In what way?
- just real attitude.
He even had trouble
taking a number like everybody else.
- He needed one lens replaced. The left lens?
- Well, that I don't remember.
But what I do remember is that
he was getting all ``weirded'' out.
- ``Weirded,'' how?
- I guess his glasses got a little lost in the shuffle.
So, I asked him
for a service slip number.
And he gets all sweaty.
And his eyes got real weird.
I went back. I asked the technicians.
Maybe they had seen them.
And I guess they were
in the tray right behind me.
But all the trays are marked
with the customer's name on it.
And he starts going,
``I have a name! I have a name!''
Pardon me, Janice.
Could you wait here a moment?
James and I will be right back.
You were right, James.
He does have prior contact with the victims.
She's next.
This name and address are false.
Paid in cash.
But we should look for the orange van.
I'll devise a proactive strategy
with Portland P.D.
Hang in there, James.
We're close.
Given the subject's
previous behavior...
he'll attempt the abduction
in the back parking lot after office hours.
He'll enter the lot
from the alley past the Dumpsters.
We got that entrance
blocked off.
Are all the unmarked vehicles in position
at the lot's other points of entry?
- Affirmative.
- Okay.
Ms. Sterling usually leaves
the building around 9:15.
- So, we got about 20 minutes.
- Are you all right, Janice?
- Yeah.
- You'll be safe in here.
DetectiveJenkins,
Mr. Horn, myself...
we'll stay in here
with you.
And there's about 20 officers
outside hiding.
- This'll all be over in the next hour.
- Frank, um-
I'm not sure it's such a good idea
for me to be around.
Why don't you blow out of here?
Go home.
I'll let you know
how it went.
Nothing here.
Act like you forgot something
and come back inside.
I need to get by!
I've got a flat.
Can you help me?
Nothing.
Unit 7, anything
up in the alley?
I'm stuck.
I can't move. I need a jack.
Got one?
This is Unit 7. We got a car
with a flat blockin' an orange van.
What kind of car?
- Give me a make on that car.
- It's a blue Taurus.
No, no. I can get it.Just a jack.
I'll be out of your way in five minutes.
Jim, no! No!
No!
Stop!
No backup here.
Get an ambulance on the horn.
Just checkin' in.
I'm back to Seattle.
Everything in the van...
is inadmissible.
The victims' possessions were
found in the subject's house.
Hair and fiber.
D.N.A. samples.
District attorney feels
it's enough that he won't get away.
I wanted to work
with the Group.
And I know,
because of my actions, that's over.
But...
I need you to tell me.
Help me, Frank.
How do you do this?
Why do you do it?
