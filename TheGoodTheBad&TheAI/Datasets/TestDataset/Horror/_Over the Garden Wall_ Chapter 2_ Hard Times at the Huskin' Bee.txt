It's almost morning.
We should've found a town by now.
This is the way the woodsman
told us to go, right?
Have you listened to anything
I've been saying?
For the last couple hours,
I've been saying ...
Well, that settles it.
I'm gonna walk up 10 feet
- ahead of you.
- Help!
- Huh?
- I'm stuck!
- I hear something!
- It's probably nothing.
Hey, look.
"Pottsfield, 1 mile."
- A town! Let's go this way.
- Okay, let's go this way.
- Not ... ugh.
- Hello? Hello?
- Hey, you.
- Who? Me?
- Yeah, you.
- Oh. Hello.
It's you again. I'm stuck.
Help me out of here,
and I'll owe you a favor.
- Whoa! I get a wish?
- No, no, no. Not a wish.
I'm not magical.
I'll just do you a good turn.
- Can you turn me into a tiger?
- Um, no.
- I just said I'm not magical.
- It doesn't have to be
- a magical tiger.
- Greg, stop talking to a bush.
- Okay.
- Huh?
Thanks. I owe you a favor.
So, um, you two are lost kids
- with no purpose in life, right?
- Uh-huh.
How about I bring you to
Adelaide of the pasture,
the good woman of the woods?
She could help you get home.
- Oh.
- N-No, no. No, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Magic talking birds leading us
to fairy godmothers in the mysterious...
- I'm going to Pottsfield.
- Yeah, we're going
to Pottsfield. Come on.
- What about the favor?
- I'll think of my wish later.
Ohh.
So, let's small-talk.
My name's Greg. What's yours?
- Beatrice.
- My brother's name is Wirt.
- Who cares?
- And my frog's name's
- Wirt Jr., but that may change.
- Okay, that's great.
How about you and I ditch your brother?
Mm. Maybe later.
So, is it nice being a bird?
- Nope.
- Oh.
- Do you like waffles?
- No, waffles make me sick.
- I eat... m-maggots.
- Aah!
- What?
- How can you not eat waffles?!
- Aah!
- What?!
- I stepped on a pumpkin!
- Aha! Civilization, see?
Now ...
Huh? What the...
All right. Let's rejoin society.
Hello?
Hello? Hmm. See anybody?
No. Oh, I see you.
- Yeah, I see you, too, Greg.
- Hey, not to be obnoxious, but
an abandoned ghost town doesn't
seem like it's gonna be that
useful getting you guys home.
There's got to be somebody somewhere.
Excuse me?
Anyone here? Hello?
Oh. Sorry.
Uh, I'm looking for a phone.
Um, I'm sorry.
- Did you find anything?
- No. Where's Greg?
- Do you hear that?
- Huh?
around the barn
of Pottsfield town
- Hmm?
- Huh?
Together: # oh, Heidi
pours your golden mead #
# and to bind the... #
What the...
Oh, pardon me there.
Say, you folks ought to don your
vegetables and celebrate
the harvest with us.
Uh... Oh!
- You're wearing costumes.
- Well, sure.
Pumpkins can't move on
their own... can they?
- Ha. No. Yeah, no.
- Good thing I didn't take this off.
You guys find this place as
- creepy as I do, right?
- So it's some kind of weird cult
where they wear vegetable
costumes and dance
around a big thing.
They seem nice enough.
Okay, you're in denial.
That's fine.
But I'm just saying, something
feels off about this place.
Well, maybe I can find
someone here who will
give us a ride home.
Greg, you stay out of trouble.
Beatrice, thank you,
but you can leave.
I can't leave.
I'm honor-bound to help
you since you guys helped me.
That's the bluebird rules.
- Uh, okay.
- Beatrice, would you care
- for this dance?
- No thanks.
No thanks, no thanks.
I said no thank you.
Say, aren't you a little too... early?
- What do you mean.
- I mean it doesn't seem like
you're ready to join us just yet.
Join you?
Yeah, no, I'm just passing through.
Folks don't tend to "pass
- through" Pottsfield.
- Oh... Yeah?
- Yeah. It's nice here.
- Um, I'm really just looking
t-to leave here as fast as possible.
Eh, what, what?
Leave Pottsfield?
- Who wants to leave Pottsfield?!
- Huh?
- What?
- He wants to leave Pottsfield.
- What?
- Oh, are we leaving already?
Let's leave immediately.
I'm just trying to get home.
- To ruin our party.
- Or take off our pumpkin shoes!
Uh, no, I, uh ...
Now, hold on, everybody.
Let's not jump to any conclusions.
- Whoa.
- Enoch, what shall we
- do with them?
- I-I'm done.
Now, let's see here, boys.
How did you end up in
this little town of ours?
Well, we were trying to get home.
We came into town from the woods.
Uh, we saw your farms and
your houses and thought,
"hey, here's a normal
place with normal people."
And we both stepped on pumpkins.
Yeah, a-and then we heard
the music from the barn, and,
well, uh ... h-how about
we just leave?
Now, let me get this straight ...
you come to our town, you
trample our crops, you interrupt
our private engagement,
- and now you want to leave?
- Uh... Yes.
You'll never convict!
You have no proof!
- This one's trying to escape!
- Let me go!
- I don't know these clowns!
- Children, it saddens me that
you don't wish to stay here
with us, particularly because
I simply have to punish you
for your transgressions.
I told you this place was bad news.
So, by order of the Pottsfield
chamber of commerce,
I find you guilty
of trespassing, destruction of
property, disturbing the peace,
- and murder.
- Murder?
Oh, no, not murder.
But for those other
crimes, I sentence you to...
- a few hours of manual labor.
- Wait. What? Really?
That's it?
time's a gentle stream,
longer than it seems
I know she's never late,
so anxiously I wait
Just a few hours of manual labor,
-  and we're almost done.
- And then what are you gonna do ...
just wander around this
way and that way through
- the woods forevermore?
- Uh, uh, maybe we'll just
stay here in Pottsfield.
It's nice here.
I don't know. I don't know.
Why do they even have
you digging these holes?
Planting seeds or something.
Maybe they're gonna bury you out here.
- Pbht!
- Hey! Buried treasure!
Whoa! Really?
See, Beatrice?
- What'd you find?
- A skeleton!
Aah!
We're digging our own ...
I-I-I was wrong.
I was wrong all along.
I-I don't know how to get us home.
Use your little feet to pick our locks!
- O-ho! Now you want my help?
- I don't want your help.
Yes, I want your help!
- Beatrice, serio...
- Your time is up!
Aah! Ohh.
Have the holes been dug?
- Uh... Yeah.
- Splendid!
- Well, then ...
- But, no.
- No?
- Uh...
Psst!
- Keep stalling.
- Right.
Yeah, uh, you know, we
were digging, and there
were too many rocks.
You guys don't like rocks, right?
I don't think we do.
- No, we don't like rocks.
- I don't think so.
See?
So we were like, "we should
- get rid of these rocks."
- Well, that's a good idea.
Right?
Yeah.
So, we were getting rid
of the rocks and ... huh?
Huh? What?
They left me.
- So, what happened to the rocks?
- Uh, the rocks.
Yeah, they ...
they were, um, you know ...
they ... they ... they got in
the way of all the ...
well, the dirt, you know, and...
W-Whoa! Ohh!
- Welcome back, Larry.
- He looks exactly the same.
- What in the...
- Whooooop! Ooh!
Yeah, Larry! Whoo!
Aah!
- Edward, this one's for you!
- They're all skeletons.
Thanks for digging up
the life of the party.
What a wonderful harvest.
And what about you?
- You sure you want to leave?
- Me? Yes?
Oh, well.
You'll join us someday.
- Uh...
- Psst!
- Why are you still here?
- What do you mean? You guys left me!
- Oh.
- Come on.
- Oh. Are they chasing us?
- Both: No.
I-I thought you guys ...
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.
I guess we're even now, huh?
You're not honor-bound
to help us anymore.
I wish.
But you weren't actually in
- any danger with those weirdos.
- Oh, yeah!
Then you still have to help us get home.
I got it! I wish
Wirt Jr. had fingernails
so he could play the guitar better.
So... Yeah, I'll bring you
to Adelaide. I mean, that's
- where I'm going anyway.
- Why are you going
- to Adelaide's?
- I guess, in some ways, I'm
- trying to get home, too.
- That's vague.
- What does that mean?
- I don't have to tell you anything.
I think his directions
were... not very good.
