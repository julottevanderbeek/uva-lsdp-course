Narrator: Previously on
AMC's The Walking Dead...
RICK: What is this place?
DEANNA: This is the start of
sustainability, community.
FATHER GABRIEL: Rick, his group...
they're dangerous.
GLENN: Noah died because of you.
You tried to kill me.
DARYL: Why?
MORGAN: Cause all
life is precious.
DEANNA: Do it.
MORGAN: Rick?
-
-
Morgan:
Rick:
-
-
This is where
it all starts tomorrow.
Tobin gets in the truck,
opens the exit and we're off.
He hops out, catches up
with his team at red
staying on the west
side of the road.
Daryl gets on his bike--
-
- You see that?
It's open!
We got to do this now!
Tobin's group, get moving, go!
- No, Rick, we're not ready.
- Sasha! Abraham!
Abraham: Damn straight,
we'll do it live.
You meet Daryl at red. Let him
take them through the gauntlet.
- Yeah, we meet at red.
- Rick:
- Rick, I'll hit the tractor place.
- Okay, who else?
We got to take them out
or they'll distract the horde.
- I'm here, let me help.
- No.
- I'm here!
- Do everything I say.
- I will. - Rick, this was supposed
to be a dry run.
- Rick:
- They're coming.
Rick, we haven't even gone
through the whole plan.
You want to go back, go back.
We're finishing this.
Tobin, you hit it on my signal.
Now!
Rick:
You were wrong.
Ron.
Thank you.
Of course.
Okay.
Glenn.
Glenn, what happened?
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
You guys look like shit.
She's fine. She's fine.
She's okay.
Tara?
I'm okay.
You just check on them.
- I'm okay.
- What happened?
We were out there.
The walkers and--
we're all right.
Got winged by a ricochet.
It's all right.
Holy shit.
Thank God...
nothing happened to your hair.
Okay, Eugene's freaking me out.
Somebody want to send Noah
in here to protect me?
You were right.
It wasn't over.
We should talk more tomorrow.
Listen...
I don't take chances anymore.
And you shouldn't.
Rick on radio:
Rick:
when you take care of the
walkers at the tractor place.
So, is he okay with it?
It was pretty much his idea.
He gets it.
It's got a bed and a bath,
but it's still a cage, you know?
He gets it.
He told me what happened
out there with the trucks.
He tell you about
those guys he met?
The Ws.
Like that walker we saw, yeah.
We need more watch points.
And I'm gonna tell Deanna we don't
need to go looking for people anymore.
You feel different about it?
Yeah, I do.
Well, people out there,
they got to take care
of themselves,
just like us.
I'm gonna get him out.
Shouldn't leave him in there
any longer than we have to.
You good?
Yeah.
I'm trying.
Listen, if you're still looking to go
buck wild with the breath impaired...
You already asked the question
and I already answered it.
If you were so worried, why the hell
did you get into the car with me?
Listen, doing something
as big as this...
that's living.
There it is.
Sasha on radio: We're at red
at the bottom of the hill.
Daryl on radio: All right,
here comes the parade.
Where'd you learn that?
A friend.
Before or after?
I ask, you answer.
It's common courtesy, right?
It was after.
After everything.
Look, I'm sorry for this,
for having to do this.
It's all right.
The way I look at it,
sometimes you're safer
when there's no way out.
Got to get to know
each other again.
For the first time...
again.
-
- Man:
We're back. You gonna
let us in or what?
I'm technically not authorized,
so I will not be doing so.
- Who the hell are you?
- You first.
I'm Heath.
I live here. My team's been on
a run the last couple weeks.
I'm Eugene.
Aaron brought myself and my group
here directly within that window,
so we haven't had the chance to meet and
I can't exactly confirm your residence.
Open the gate.
If I do, how do I know
you won't attempt to kill me?
Okay, look, I'm not gonna kill you.
But the longer you make me wait,
the more you motivate me
to beat your ass, so...
Thank you.
So Deanna put you on gate duty?
Oh, no, I'm not proper duty.
This is Holly's shift.
I was just walking by.
She asked if I could
relieve her for a few ticks.
I said, "No, thank you"
and she ignored me,
which is obviously
what I should have done
as it's been at least five
ticks and still no Holly.
I'm Scott.
This is Annie.
Hi.
Good to meet you.
How many of you are there?
I mean, 12.
Annie:
I'll close up.
Anything big happen
while we were gone?
Well, we had a meeting
last night.
Oh, yeah?
About what?
You might want
to talk to Deanna.
Get it from the horse.
Her mouth.
You know?
Right.
I fully respect the hair game.
- Who put up the wall?
- They did.
There was a man, Reg.
He drew up plans,
made it happen early on.
A lot of people in here.
They've been inside
from the start.
They had food, energy,
not a whole lot of walkers.
They just lived.
They haven't had to survive.
They figured that out,
brought us in.
Still might be too late.
Too late how?
For them to come around.
We'll see.
You'll have to talk to Deanna.
She's the woman in charge.
She was married to Reg.
Was?
Yeah.
What are you doing?
We're--
I wanted to help.
We only need one.
We have two men here.
We're not gonna bury killers
inside these walls.
I understand how you feel.
I do.
But it's not your decision.
Tobin.
Rick's right.
Take it away.
Go west.
Down Branton Road a few miles.
Let the trees have him.
I shot him
because he killed Reg.
That was it.
We didn't have a choice.
You do have a cell.
Not for killers.
I'm a killer, Rick.
I am, and you are, too.
Glenn, you there yet?
Glenn: Almost. We'll have it
handled before they get here.
Copy that.
It'll hold.
Well, that's good.
You know, considering
where we're standing.
Michonne.
Yeah?
Back when you were
in that place...
where I lived...
did you take one
of my protein bars?
No.
See, I could have sworn there was
one more peanut butter left.
That's how it is, isn't it?
You always think there's one
more peanut butter left.
Morgan.
Maybe we just leave him here.
That's not who you are.
I know.
Hey.
You don't.
Morgan.
Morgan.
Stop.
Did you hear that?
What are you doing
out here, Ron?
I wanted to know
where my dad was buried.
Rick:
How what?
How the community's still here.
They've had walkers
at their walls,
but a lot of them,
maybe most of them,
they wound up here.
Ron.
- Ron.
- I'm going back.
- Hey.
-
You shouldn't be out here.
I don't care what you think.
It's not what I think,
it's what I know.
You can't protect yourself.
I'll show you how,
but right now you have
no idea what you're doing.
And if you come out here,
you're gonna die.
And it won't be quick
and it won't ever be over
'cause you'll be one of them.
That's what's gonna happen.
You're coming back with us now.
Don't make it hard.
Rick on radio:
-
- Glenn:
Nicholas:
Sounds like a lot.
- We need it quiet.
- So what's the plan?
Take 'em out a few at a time.
Nicholas, you're at the door.
All right.
You let one or two out
and then you close it.
You keep doing that. That's the trick.
That's how we control it.
- Heath--
- Wait, what if he can't close it?
-
- Then we take them on.
We take them on?
If we get into trouble,
we go behind the building
into the woods
and we draw them away.
Hey, you've been out
on runs since he got here.
He knows what he's doing.
Me and Aiden, we didn't.
This was supposed to be
a dress rehearsal.
I'm supposed to be
delivering pizzas, man.
Daryl's leading them this way
and they're closing in.
That noise is gonna pull
the herd right off the road
and then we have
serious trouble.
We have to do this.
Yeah, okay.
- Okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay.
All right.
Glenn: On three. Ready?
One...
two...
three!
Shit!
Heath:
back when we were on
one of those first scouts,
finding out
what was around here.
There was a camp at the bottom.
The people, they must have blocked
the exits with one of those trucks
back when everything
started to go bad.
They didn't make it.
They were all roamers.
Maybe a dozen of them.
No one's been back since?
DC,
every town worth scavenging are
all in the other direction.
And I never really felt like having a
picnic next to the camp that ate itself.
So all the while the walkers
have been drawn by the sound
and they're making more sound
and they're drawing more in.
And here we are.
Now what I'm proposing,
I know it sounds risky,
but walkers are already
slipping through the exits.
One of the trucks
keeping the walkers in
could go off the edge
any day now.
Maybe after one more hard rain.
This isn't about if
it gives, it's when.
It's gonna happen.
That's why we have
to do this soon.
This is-- I don't even
have another word for it.
This is terrifying.
All of it.
But it doesn't sound like
there's any other way.
Maybe there is.
I mean, couldn't we just
build up the weak spots?
I could draw up plans.
I worked on the wall with Reg.
Even if we could,
the sound of those walkers
is drawing more
and more every day.
Building up the exits
won't change that.
Deanna: We're gonna
do what Rick says,
the plan he's laid out.
I told you all, we're gonna
have Daryl leading them away.
Sasha:
I'll take a car,
ride next to him.
Can't just be him.
I'll keep 'em coming, Daryl
keeps 'em from getting sloppy.
I'll go with her.
It's a long way
to white-knuckle it solo.
We'll have two teams.
One on each side of the forest
helping manage this thing.
We're gonna have a few
people on watch from now on.
Rosita, Spencer, and Holly.
So they're out.
So who's in?
Me.
You should keep an eye on her.
Keep going with the plans
you talked about.
Maggie: I know, but
this is important.
She's important.
People are scared.
They need to see her come back.
That's not the only reason.
Yeah, it isn't.
Okay.
I'm in.
I'd like to help as well.
No.
Who else?
We need more.
Carter: There's got
to be another play.
We can't just control that many.
I said it before,
walkers herd up.
They'll follow a path
if something's drawing them.
That's how we can
get 'em all at once.
So, what? We're supposed to
just take your word for it?
We're all supposed to just fall
in line behind you after...
After what?
After you wave a gun around
screaming,
pointing it at people.
-
- Enough!
I'll do it.
Me, too.
Whatever you need, I'm in.
Deanna:
I'll go.
We have to do this.
I need to help.
You sure you can handle it?
You need people.
We'll make this work.
We'll keep this place safe.
Keep our families safe.
We will.
The plan.
Go through it again.
Man, he just said it.
Every part again.
The exact plan.
Marshall and Redding.
- We force them west here.
- Deanna:
We block it off so they
can only go one way,
west, away from the community.
Carter:
We'll use the RVs,
some of the bigger trucks,
We'll be drawing them away.
- They're gonna keep moving.
- Carter:
Just bouncing off some sedans?
And then when they start
slipping through
and the ones that walk away
start distracting the rest
and you stop drawing them away?
Man's got a point.
Eugene:
The big-ass metal ones
from the construction site.
We can use them
to fortify the whip wall.
It'd help disperse
the force of impact
and direct the walkers clean.
Like a pool table.
Eight ball, corner pocket.
That's an army out there.
And what happens
when this doesn't hold?
And they push on through.
The curve in this hillside
is gonna send them
right back east.
Right back here.
You seriously want to risk that?
No.
So you need to help us
to make it hold.
These walls, you built them.
So you've already
done the impossible.
Carter.
Please.
-
-
Hey, what you said before about us
needing to take care of ourselves?
Going out finding more people,
that is taking care
of ourselves.
Your call, though.
Thanks.
You know, I can come
with all of you.
You and Daryl have been
teaching me how to shoot.
I think you got the hang of it.
Rick:
We'll get there.
She's in charge.
But you're in charge now.
- This is a bad idea.
- This is the only idea.
I think there's something
like a dozen in there.
We stay back, we get on opposite
ends, we draw them to each of us.
- Try and take down four each?
- No.
This is just me and Heath.
You get back and you stay back.
Things go south, you tell
Rick and you draw them away.
Just move back.
He got Noah killed?
He did.
He did more than that.
He lured Glenn into the woods
and tried to kill him.
What the hell?
- Yeah.
- What?
Glenn told me I could tell everyone
if that's what I wanted to do.
Could get Nicholas exiled.
He'd die out there.
Could have done that.
You could do that now.
He got Noah killed
and he tried to kill Glenn?
Glenn saves people.
Even people like that.
But then I thought about you.
How we were on different
sides of that fence
on the worst day of my life.
And now you're one of the most
important people in the world to me.
Things can get better.
We can make them better.
You tell me what you want to do.
I'm just gonna follow
your lead, okay?
Okay.
I'm sorry.
You ready?
No. But since you're
doing this thing anyway...
All right.
They're still coming.
Get it.
Glenn:
Let's go.
Here you go.
Oh, thank you.
It's Carol, right?
Yeah.
You been with Rick long?
Since Atlanta.
And were you a cop, too?
Why would you think that?
You're always watching.
You always...
seem ready.
For what?
You know, to handle things.
Aren't you sweet?
What is it?
Got some looky-loos taking a little
constitutional off the shoulder.
They starting a damn walkout.
You want to have Daryl
circle back?
No.
Keep moving.
I'll catch up.
Abraham.
Idiot.
Abraham:
This is my ride, asshole.
Whoo!
Well, look at me.
You didn't see Reg
the night he got it.
That was a mess.
And Pete.
His face just...
blowing up like Pompeii
right when we were
cheek to cheek.
I still think I got some
of his brains in my ear.
Well, look at that.
All right.
Everything is aces again.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm just grabbing
the bull by the nutsack.
I'm living, darling,
just like you.
I haven't had a chance
to say it yet,
but I'm sorry about Reg.
He was smart and kind.
He was a good man.
It was the right call.
We need this.
What else?
You need to tell me.
People need to be armed
inside the walls.
They need to be trained,
everyone.
-
-
Stop.
Here they come.
- Man: Wait, folks.
- Hey.
Use your shovels.
The guns will draw more.
Help us.
You can do this.
You need to, all of you.
Rick:
Morgan, don't!
You said you don't
take chances anymore.
Carter:
He's talking about a dry run tomorrow.
That's it.
Olivia: Rick stopped Pete.
He stopped him.
Carter: This is not
taking out a wife-beater.
Tobin:
Carter: What Rick wants
to do is suicide.
I'm sorry, Spencer, but Deanna
is asleep at the wheel.
What the priest said about
him, about these people,
'Cause pretty soon
it's gonna be too late.
Olivia: Carter, you need
to be really careful here.
You're talking about us going
to Deanna and telling her--
Carter: No, I'm not talking
about talking some more.
About meetings.
I'm not talking about that.
Plain and simple, we kill him
Hello.
Tobin:
- He heard.
- I didn't.
- I mean, I didn't--
- Tobin:
He heard.
Olivia: Carter, don't.
You can't.
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing?
I'm taking this place
back from you.
That's what you were
talking about in here?
That's what he
was talking about.
See, I would have-- I would
have set up some lookouts.
That would have been
the smart thing.
You know,
if I happened to--
-
-
You really think you're gonna
take this community from us?
From Daryl?
From me?
Do you have any idea
who you're talking to?
- It was just me.
- What?
It was--
it was just me.
Just-- just kill me.
Rick.
I'm good.
I'm good.
You can try to work with us.
You can try to survive.
Would you do that?
It's working.
You were right.
Everyone, we need
to finish this.
We have to keep moving and fan out
down that thing front to back.
Glenn, you take the back.
- You got the other walkie.
- Got it.
If it gets sloppy,
we fire our weapons,
pull them back on track.
- I'll hit the front.
- Okay, one after the other.
-
-
Tobin, they're breaking off.
Tobin: What do you
want us to do?
Fire your guns
and draw them back.
It's nice out.
Yeah.
Hope you don't mind.
I wanted to enjoy
the evening a little
and I don't have a porch
over there, so...
Get your stuff.
You should stay
with us over here.
Morgan:
Rick:
We don't need
to do that anymore.
I know you, Morgan.
Even if this is the first time.
You want to hold her?
Okay.
- This is Morgan.
-
He's a friend of mine.
Hey.
Hi.
Okay.
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
You with that man Carter,
in the armory--
that's you.
You're still the same man
I met in King County.
The one that came back
and told me it wasn't over.
That was you.
Same you that's right in
front of me right now.
I wanted to kill him.
So it would be easier.
So I wouldn't have to worry
about how he could screw up
or what stupid thing he'd do
next because that's who he is.
Just somebody who
shouldn't be alive now.
I wanted to kill him.
But all that hit me and...
I realized
I didn't have to do it.
He doesn't get it.
Somebody like that...
they're gonna die
no matter what.
Oh, I'm dead.
- Carter, take a breath.
-
Carter.
- Oh, God!
- Be quiet. Shh.
- Oh, God.
- Carter. Carter, shh.
-
- You got to be quiet.
-
- Shh.
Tobin on radio:
- Rick:
- Tobin:
That was Carter.
He got bit right in the face.
I stopped him.
We have a good hour until
we have 'em to green
when we hand them off to
Daryl, Sasha, and Abraham.
Why don't you head back, tell
everyone what's happening?
- They should know.
- Okay, Rick, I just--
Will you do that for me?
I'll take care of that one.
Michonne, you take point.
I know it's how it is.
I do.
Yeah.
I do, too.
Rick:
I was just getting
more flares for tomorrow.
I know I haven't--
I just-- I just thought
it might be best
if I let things be for a while.
Ron told me what happened.
Yeah, I wanted to talk
to you about that.
- He shouldn't have been out there.
- No, he shouldn't have.
You're right.
But you can't talk
to him like that, Rick.
You can't touch him.
Not you.
Ron needed to hear
every word I said.
That's why I grabbed him.
I wasn't angry.
I was just telling
him the truth.
If it's coming from you,
he can't hear it.
You got to understand that.
He needs to know
how to handle himself.
- I can teach him. I can teach you.
- Rick.
- You need to know how.
- Rick.
When I found out
we could have them,
I asked Rosita
to start showing me how.
Okay? She's gonna teach me
and I'm gonna teach Ron
and I'm gonna teach Sam.
I heard what you were saying
to us at the meeting.
And at my house
before, you know.
I am gonna fight, Rick.
All right,
this is the finish line.
When we make it to green,
we fall back.
The ditches and ridges
will keep them on the road.
We head home, but Daryl,
Sasha, and Abraham
take them the rest of
the way, 20 miles more.
All right, let's go.
Got a question for you.
Just some intel before our
little road trip tomorrow.
Ask me.
You doing this
'cause you want to die?
No.
We're gonna take 'em
right past here.
All that noise
could distract them.
We'll clear it on
our way back tonight.
We don't want any
surprises tomorrow.
Hey, what you've done,
you're gonna sit
with it a while,
'cause I don't want you
out here tomorrow.
You're not ready.
You will be.
Some time soon,
I'll make sure of it.
And then you start
to make it right.
Thank you.
I know this sounds insane,
but this is an insane world.
We have to come for them
before they come for us.
It's that simple.
What the hell is happening?
It's a horn or something.
It's pulling the back
half off the road.
Oh, God.
Michonne: Whatever
that is, it's far.
- It sounds like it's coming from--
- Home.
