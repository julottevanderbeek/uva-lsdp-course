Santa: Easy there, Blitzen.
My old friend, Comet.
It's time.
Who's there?!
Dan". Merry Christmas,
Bailey Downs!
"Dangerous Dan" is
gonna tell you a secret.
I love Christmas!
There, I said it.
I don't care who knows it 'cause
I love tinsel, I love Rudolph,
I love cranberries,
I love baby Jesus!
Before he went all hippy with
the sandals and long hair.
What?
No no, no, no no,
Susan, I'm gonna
talk about Jesus on the radio.
You know why?
Because it's his birthday
tomorrow, am I right, folks?
Speaking of
reminders, it's almost
time for the big
charity food drive
at the mall this afternoon.
Our very own
weatherman of action,
Stormin' Norman is gonna be
down there helping out like the
true Christmas angel he is.
Norman, is there any
truth to the rumor
that a very special
guest is gonna
be making an appearance
at the food drive?
Norman?
Hmm, oh, hey Norman,
he's writing me a
little Christmas card.
This is exciting.
What's it gonna say?
Wow, Norman.
Susan, did you see that?
You know who saw that?
Jesus saw that!
And his dad. He saw that.
All right folks, looks like...
Norman's hitting the trail,
so we'll just get this
Christmas party
started without him!
Yes, sir!
We're gonna share the spirit.
We're gonna deck some halls!
I'm gonna get Susan
under the mistletoe
and you, my little elves,
you're gonna listen to one of
my favorite songs.
So here's to the season!
Here's to you, Bailey Downs.
Favorite time
of year is here
Let's get this Christmas
party started right.
I fill my cup with
Some Christmas cheer
Girlfriend's late.
Impossible, we use protection.
Made the mistake of watching
this alone last night,
but nobody can know
I have this, okay?
Constable Scott Peters,
conducting
I used to babysit
his son, Will.
Victim's a male,
Caucasian, late teens.
Voiceover: Oh, boy.
Scott". Body showing signs
of obvious staging suggesting
Got some writing on
the wall over here.
Voiceover: Look at that.
Voiceover: I don't know.
Voiceover: What do you hear?
Scott, what are you hearing?
he--
Voiceover: Fuck!
Christ!
Okay, why was that
cop singing that song?
No one knows, he went
on stress leave after this
and doesn't talk about it.
Okay, and you still wanna go
down there just for some
stupid school assignment?
Man up, Dylan.
We obviously can't
use the police video,
so we have to get
our own footage.
Hey, babies.
You're late, bitch.
Sorry, dad pulled
this family trip
out of his ass an hour ago.
Merry Christmas.
It'll get you through
any door in the school.
I love you so much right now.
Wow Caprice, I can't
believe you actually got them.
That's my honey.
Stickiest fingers
in Bailey Downs.
Gotta go.
Don't get busted.
Taylor: Come on,
we got a long drive.
Christmas Eve and you wanna
drive to see your old aunt who,
as far as I know,
doesn't even like you.
She doesn't like anyone.
Okay, fine, but you're
dragging us along with you.
You know what, and I expect
everyone to be on
their best behavior.
Okay, we're not in Saint
Barth's for Christmas,
that's fine, or even
Aspen, that's--
Okay, look, I just wanted
to have some bonding time.
You hear that, I want this
to be a happy, loving family.
So you want a
Christmas miracle.
Scott: All right,
son, let's get that tree.
It's cold out here, huh?
Will: I want the
new Morph Machine.
The Morph Machine
with the motorcycle
and the guy has a green vest.
Not the blue one, the other guy
with the Morph Machine.
You Okay?
We can go back if you want.
- Iâ€™m okay.
-He'll be fine, he'll be fine.
Not here.
What do you mean not here?
Baby, look at those, huh?
Tell me you will find the
perfect Christmas tree.
Look, we can go
right through here.
Great, nice example
for a cop, Scott.
We're in the
middle of nowhere.
No one's gonna even
know we're here.
Go on.
Come on!
Right behind you, son.
Come on, don't be scared.
Dylan:
Quit groping her,
let's get on with it.
Thanks.
Five, four, three...
Christmas, usually a time of joy
and celebration, but for
Saint Joseph's Academy,
a time of mourning.
Exactly one year ago
last Christmas Eve
this school was the scene of an
unimaginable crime when two
of its students,
Connor and Jenna,
seen here, were found
murdered in cold blood.
With the killer still at large,
the atmosphere here
in Bailey Downs
is truly grim this
holiday season.
I'm Molly Simon, and this
is  in the Hallways.
- Dylan: Wait, cut.
-What?
Are we really going
with that cheesy title?
Your opinion would mean
a lot more to me if you
weren't failing Media Arts.
Shh shh shh, hold on guys,
I think I hear something.
Harod: I'm fine!
Shit.
It's Principal Harod.
We just need to be careful.
Yes, I...
I know!
Listen to me!
Go, go, go, 90!
No, not that one, the other one.
Molly, hurry UP-
Wait.
Never mind, now
I'm getting jumpy.
Molly: Principal Harod.
Dylan: What the hell is he
doing here on Christmas Eve?
Molly: Keep it down!
Great.
Ben: I've got flashlights.
Oh, nice.
Come on, it's this way.
Diane: Wow!
She better remember
us in the will.
It's about time she
invited us here.
She did invite us, right?
Think of it as a
Christmas surprise.
- Taylor!
-What, 'its the season.
She'll be thrilled.
Mmmmm
You see, the thing is...
To be honest, Aunt Etta,
I know you
and mom had
difficulties and I just
thought we could
get it out there
and deal with it.
Dear, maybe now's
not a good time.
It's Christmas, what
could be a better time?
Christmas is all
about forgiveness
and family and tradition.
If you just believe, if you let
that spirit in, it fills you.
Don't touch that!
It's very old.
Is there some
place more private
you and I could talk, I wanna
show you something I think
you might be interested in.
Come.
Four hours in the car and the
old bat doesn't even
offer me a drink.
I'll help myself, thank you.
Look at this place, it's like
Paul Bunyan and
Count Dracula gayed up
and built a dream home.
That is not a toy.
Oh, hi there, we're the--
I know who you are.
Okay.
This is Krampus, right?
What's a Krampus?
He's like an anti-Santa Claus,
a demon who punishes
the naughty.
He whips them, chains them up,
throws them in a
sack, stuff like that.
When Krampus knocked,
the demon hunts the wicked
from sunset to sunrise.
That's fun.
He comes for little boys who
touch things they shouldn't.
Oops.
Duncan!
That was very unwise.
We will pay for it
of course, pick it up.
Gerhart, what have you done?
Gerhart: I did nothing.
The boy had...
An unfortunate accident.
Take your family
and leave now.
Taylor: Let's
not be hasty here.
Etta: No, my son, I feel
one of my spells coming
and I cannot entertain guests.
Good bye.
Bicycle parts to Sector Five!
Organs sets to arrive!
Video games...
Get out of the way,
get out of the way!
Have to take it
out again this year.
Ho ho ho!
Talk to the Mrs., Sparkles.
Santa, I need your signature.
Thank you.
So what are we up against
this year, Jingles?
Blizzard warning along
the Eastern seaboard.
Never met a blizzard
that troubled me.
Jingles:
It's bad, it's really bad.
Another signature here.
Jingles: I'm worried
about the trade winds.
Trade winds.
Jingles: Safety first, Santa.
Right
here on the left.
Lots of kids are depending
on tonight going
off without a hitch.
Shiny?
Take a break, everyone!
Voiceover: Yay, Mrs. Claus!
Even Christmas magic
needs a little fuel.
- Oh ho, cookies!
-Smells good.
Cookies!
Have a cookie, Shiny.
No, I...
I don't know.
No thank you.
It'll keep your strength
up for the long shift.
I'm not hungry.
Voiceover: Not hungry?
- They're cookies!
-You're being silly, Shiny,
you know how much
you love my cookies.
I said I don't want
a goddamn cookie!
You reindeer fucking snow whore!
Martha: Shiny!
He...
He's dead.
Dead?
But elves--
Jingles: Can't die.
Santa, elves can't die, right?
No.
They cannot.
Scott: Yeah, he's gonna help
his pop put this up too.
Will: This tree is way
better than the
ones at the mall.
Scott: We did it.
Stop, we can't do this again.
Oh, no way.
They won't even miss it.
Woman:
Scott: Look at this,
babe, this is a perfect tree.
Smells like pine, you love pine.
Yeah yeah yeah, I don't think
it's gonna fit up the stairs.
Of course it will,
it'll be fine, trust me.
Where's Will?
He was right here with us.
Will?
- Will?
-Will!
- Woman: Baby!
-Come on, we gotta go!
This ain't time to
play hide and seek now!
Where are you, babe?!
We gotta go, come on, son!
Will!
Come on, boy, stop
playing, we gotta go!
Where are you, baby?!
Mom?!
- Come on, honey, let's go!
-William, where are you?!
Dad!
William!
Where are you?!
Will!
Where'd he go?
Couldn't have gone far.
- Over here.
-Oh, God.
Will!
Baby?!
This way, through here.
Son!
Will!
Will!
Will!
William!
Woman: Will!
Oh God.
Will!
Will?!
Come here, buddy!
Scott!
Will.
Will!
Will, are you okay?
What the hell happened?
Why'd you take off like that?
Why?
Don't yell at him!
It was your idea
to come out here!
Oh, boy, real palace
of fun down here.
Saint Joseph's
used to be a convent
a long time ago, this is part
of the original building.
Dylan: You could be
a bride of Christ too,
Molly, you've got the whole
virgin thing going on.
Actually, this
is where they kept
the unmarried girls
who got pregnant.
It was a big deal back then
if they weren't married, you had
to keep them out of sight.
Didn't they shut this place
down before it became a school?
Yeah, yeah, there were a lot
of weird stories going around
like this 15 year
old girl claimed
she was a virgin, said it was
a miracle like the
Virgin Mary, but...
No one believed her.
So what happened to her?
Don't you know, Ben?
- It was your mom.
-No, actually, she died
trying to abort her baby.
Let's go.
This is it.
This is where Connor
and Jenna were killed.
Are you getting this?
Ben: You guys hear that?
Dylan: What?
Stay focused.
- This is where--
-We know. We saw the video.
Molly: I wanna make sure
I don't forget anything.
- Yeah?
-Yeah. Let's see.
Stick to the
camera light, Dylan.
Words aren't really your thing.
I just wanna make sure
there's no more
horror in the hallways.
You Okay?
What's wrong?
Ben: Nothing.
Five minutes.
You guys couldn't act like a
normal goddamn family
for five minutes.
I think we're pretty normal
compared to those two.
That creep deliberately
baited Duncan.
Sweetheart,
it wasn't your fault.
I don't know why
your aunt got so
mad over some stupid
piece of.
She wasn't mad.
She was scared.
I can't believe
you dragged us here
on Christmas Eve
so that you could
hustle your own aunt,
that is a new low,
Taylor, even for you.
It's not a hustle,
the Bioplex is a
means of integrating technology
into a sustainable
future where--
Scientific innovation
is a shared experience.
Fine, yeah, it's
all good when it
pays for the house
and the vacations
and the school and
the orthodontist,
but, oh, otherwise,
no, it's a big joke!
Come on!
Come on, come on.
Damn, damn, damn!
Seriously?
I'm standing at the very spot
where Connor was found crucified
exactly one year ago
today on Christmas Eve.
Connor's neck was broken.
Over here, Jenna's
mutilated body
was found hanging off
some metal piping
in the ceiling.
Why would somebody
go to so much effort?
That is just one of the many
unanswered questions
in this baffling case.
How's it look?
You guys...
It's still here.
Unto us a child is born.
Unto us a son is given.
That's fucking creepy.
It's from Isaiah, Chapter 9,
Verse 6 about the
birth of Jesus.
Okay, this place
is creeping me out.
I think we've got
everything we need, let's go.
Yeah, won't argue
with you there.
What the hell?
What's wrong?
What the fuck?
I could've sworn
it was this one.
Molly, come on, hurry up.
Move.
I tried them all three times,
none of them fit.
Crap.
Okay.
Hello?
Principal Harod!
Principal Harod?
Hello?
Principal Harod!
Fuck!
Of course now he isn't around.
Can't see anything.
I've got full bars
and some service,
it should be ringing.
Guys, what if Principal
Harod locked us in?
Why would he do that?
For all we know, he
could be down here with us.
I got nothing, too.
Come on, baby.
Smile.
Will, you okay?
Come on, sport,
don't just sit there.
Look like you've never seen
a Christmas tree before,
why don't you help your
old man, all right?
I like that one.
Right there.
I wasn't around much
last Christmas, I know.
This year we're
having fun, right?
Slow down, Will.
Looks like someone's
worked up an appetite.
That's his second serving.
It must be good.
It's making me
hungry, let's eat.
You're eating too fast,
you're gonna get a tummy ache.
Hey.
Will, you hear your
mother talking to you?
All right, I think
that's enough.
Damn it!
What the fuck?
Scott, no!
I'll handle it.
Yeah, you handle it.
What's wrong with that kid?
Why'd you do that?
Answer me!
Go to your room right now!
Christmas, the most
magical time of year,
but in Bailey Downs this
Christmas, it's different.
It's gotta be.
It's true, my friends,
and you know it is.
Before I put another
jingle in your stocking,
I want you to think about
the little ones in
your life and give
a thought to the little ones
who aren't with us anymore.
Yeah, this next one's for them.
For Connor.
From Saint Joseph's Academy
taken from us last year cruelly.
I know they're listening.
Somewhere out there.
Martha, thank God!
What's going on?
It's the elves,
I fear they may
all become infected.
Martha: Infected?
What do you mean?
Others are sick?
It's worse than that.
What happened?
Shiny's body is gone.
He was laid to rest, but now it
may already be too late.
But this doesn't
make any sense.
Elves becoming
the walking dead?
No, it does not make any sense.
Unless he is behind it.
Stand back, Martha!
You need to hide!
Open up, you fat
fucking piece of shit!
Here's Shiny!
Shiny risen from the dead!
Quick, go, hide!
Where's my fucking cookie?!
Stay back, Jingles!
Yeah, yeah, I got you,
you cocksucker!
Motherfucker, oh shit!
I didn't find any
windows without bars.
Same here.
Guys, I can't be
here, I'm supposed
to be at the mall helping
with the food drive or
mom's gonna kill me.
We've all got places to be,
it's Christmas Eve, bro.
There's gotta be
another way out of here.
Oh God.
A little jumpy, Dylan?
Oh, this is a nativity scene.
The school didn't
put it up this year.
Molly: You can't
openly display
a nativity scene anymore.
It's the war on Christmas.
Damn it, more bars.
Fuck, it's freezing down here.
Dylan: I can hear it.
Damn thing is on.
It won't...
Heat up.
Look, if we just sit around
and wait it out, I'm sure that
somebody is gonna notice.
Only Caprice knows
we're down here
and she's out of town.
The school's not gonna reopen
for another week and a half.
Look, if there was ever a time
to notice three missing kids,
tonight would be it, right?
We always open one gift.
Every Christmas Eve.
We eat pizza with champagne.
Watch The Sound of Music.
Before we go to bed...
We each open one gift.
Not this year.
Hell of a Christmas, huh?
Hey.
It's not pizza and
champagne, but...
Merry Christmas.
Thanks, Dylan.
I didn't realize
how starving I am.
Yeah.
What if he comes back?
Who?
The guy who killed
Jenna and Connor,
what if he comes back tonight,
I mean we're trapped down here.
There's a psychopath
on the loose.
Psycho's already here.
Principal Harod,
I'm sure he locked
the door on us, who
else could it be?
I get that he's creepy, okay,
but that doesn't
mean he's a killer.
Then what's he doing here?
On Christmas Eve?
What makes matters
worse, I gotta piss.
I'm sure Joe won't mind...
If I borrow this.
Where's this...?
Caprice will know something's
up when Dylan doesn't
call her tonight.
Ugh, what is
that fucking smell?
Do you hear that?
What is it?
What is it?
I don't know.
It stopped.
Ben: Molly, Molly!
Dylan: What's going on?
Ben: I don't know what. She started
kicking and twitching!
Dylan: Molly!
Will!
Get out!
Hey.
Hey.
How's your hand?
Scott: I'll live.
Have you noticed Will hasn't
had to use his inhaler?
Really?
That's a good thing, right?
Yeah.
Something seems wrong.
Maybe we should take
him to the doctor?
Scott: The doctor?
On Christmas Eve?
Maybe we should just
keep an eye on him.
Come here.
You know, they
say you're allowed
to open one gift
before Christmas.
Scott...
Not right now.
All right, I just figured,
you know, it's...
It's been awhile.
Kim: With what's going on?
Scott: What's going on with me?
What are you saying?
Kim: I mean with Will.
The way he's been acting.
Scott: Yeah, sure, whatever.
You know what, forget it.
No, wait.
Dan". Yes!
"Dangerous" Dan!
Let's listen to this
Christmas classic.
Diane: We should
have stayed on the road.
Didn't exactly wear my "trudging
through the woods" boots.
Taylor: Look, this
will help us shave
a half hour off our
walk back to Etta's,
plus I gave you all the option
of staying in the car.
Caprice: Yeah, where mom
and I would be easy prey
for drunk hillbilly
rapists, no thanks, Dad.
Duncan: We
should make weapons.
Caprice: What?
Duncan: In case
whatever dad nearly hit
comes and hunts us,
the sun has set,
it is officially Krampusnacht,
the night of Krampus.
Son, that Krampus is a
load of old German bull--
Dad!
Oh, my God, what happened?
Oh, my God, you're bleeding!
Am I shot?
I don't know!
Oh, my God.
Duncan, get back here!
Duncan!
' Got it!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, Duncan!
Duncan!
Duncan!
Duncan!
Duncan, where are you?
Duncan!
Answer me!
Duncan?
Duncan?
Duncan?!
Oh, my God!
Where is he?
- I don't know.
- I don't know.
We need the police.
Mom, there's no
service out here.
What is that?!
Come on.
Run!
We have to run.
Duncan?
Sparkles!
Sparkles!
I'm gonna eat
your fucking brains
out, you Christmas cunt.
FUCK you!
I'll break that fucking staff
in your rosy-cheeked
ass, you fucker!
I'm sorry, Shiny.
I know it isn't your fault.
You don't have the
Christmas balls, you--
Bailey Downs,
it's getting close there
and we're counting
down to Christmas
and "Dangerous" Dan is pulling
his annual double shift to stay
with you until the end.
What?
What, we're...
Okay, well we're gonna check in
with good ol' Stormin' Norman
down at the charity food drive.
Hey Norman!
Normey, you're a little
scratchy there, buddy.
What, I did press
the button, Susan,
why don't you press
your own button?
Ahhh!
Sorry, folks, looks
like we got some of
those winter weather
technical difficulties,
too many reindeer
in the atmosphere.
That's my bet, so let's throw
another eggnog on the fire.
No wait a minute,
let's throw another log
on the fire and pour
yourself another eggnog.
You know, get some
good Christmas vibes.
Out to Susan who is seriously
harshing my buzz right now.
And listen to this
holly jolly classic.
Little shit.
Will.
Will!
Will, where are you?
Hey, whoa, what is it?
Where is he?
Huh?
Where is he, Will!
There you are.
Baby, don't, don't!
Did you open those presents?
Did you?
- Say something!
-Scott!
You think this is a game?
What are you doing?!
Say something.
Look at him, think it's
all one big fucking joke!
- Scott!
-You think this is funny?
- No!
-Move!
No, no, no!
Don't! Stop!
I knew this would happen!
You refused to see a doctor,
you said you could handle it!
'ZZZ
Did you not see what he did?!
Get out!
Will, you all right?
Hello?
Man: ls this
the Peters household?
Yes.
Man:  a
Who is this?
You don't know
me, just consider
me a concerned neighbor.
You were on my land,
took one of my trees,
What do you want?
Your boy, how is he?
Did something happen
to him in the grove?
Look, I don't know--
Man: I said, did something
happen to your boy.
He got lost,
but we found him later.
No, you didn't.
He's still lost.
so you're gonna
have to do as I say.
Bring the changeling back
to the forest
where you lost your son.
Changeling?
What the hell is that?
An animal.
That ain't your son.
Don't call again.
Huh?
Molly?
We were worried about you.
What is it?
- You okay?
-Just come.
I have to show you something.
Should I wake Ben?
Where are you going?
Molly?
Okay.
You kidding me?
Molly.
Wait.
You're serious?
Whoa, okay.
Molly, Molly, Molly,
Molly, whoa.
Hey, this isn't gonna happen,
Molly, I have a girlfriend.
I think you're in
shock or something.
Will?
Will?
Will, is that you?
I shouldn't have lost my
head like that, I'm sorry.
Dad's just been a
little stressed lately.
But I'm trying.
I'm trying to be better.
Scott?
Hurry!
Hurry!
Get in, in, in!
Pull him here, get him here.
- Okay, shh!
-Okay.
Do you think that
you could walk?
We have to find Duncan.
I can go, I can go.
Dad, no you can't.
Mom, we have to stay here,
something's still out there.
He is out there by himself.
Mom, what if it
really is Krampus?
We have to stay in this
church until sunrise.
That is insane, let's go.
Yeah it is.
Church, church, we
have to confess our sins.
I'm not gonna make
it to sunrise,
I've lost too much blood.
We have to get past that thing.
They say it comes
for the wicked.
Maybe if we confess in a church,
we can absolve
ourselves of our sins.
Diane: That is ridiculous.
I stole this.
Diane: You what?
From Aunt Etta's.
I don't know why, I
can't really help myself.
But honest, I'm not as bad as
those other kids
with the sex and
the drugs and the cutting and...
Mom, I don't do that.
I just steal stuff.
Stupid stuff.
I'm sorry.
Even if this is
that Krampus thing,
none of this is
gonna help, okay,
that monster took Duncan
and Duncan was innocent.
No he wasn't.
What do you think
happened to all our pets?
I'm going out there myself.
Mom, the day
our cat disappeared
I found Duncan in the
garage with a garbage bag.
He had blood all over his hands.
- He was smiling.
-No! No!
This is your fault!
If you had just spent more
time with him, but all
you care about is your
stupid precious business--
There is no business.
What?
Bioplex has been
dead for years.
I just raise money to pay
debts to keep things going.
It's all gonna
come crashing down.
Etta was my last hope and
she thinks I'm a swindler.
She's probably right.
I'm so sorry, we're
gonna lose everything.
I'm going to jail.
Why would you--
It was the only
way I could keep you.
I mean, come on.
A guy like me with
a woman like you?
I wanted to give
you nice things.
A nice home, make you happy,
give you the life you deserve.
I just thought that you
weren't interested anymore.
Oh no.
I did it all for you.
Merry Christmas.
I'm sorry.
Taylor!
Taylor!
Taylor!
Dad!
Diane: Go, get in, get in!
Shhh...
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
Mom...
There's something on my leg.
There's something on my leg.
Shhh...
Caprice, I love you,
I love you, run, go, run!
Right here, you son of a bitch!
What are you doing?
Can you move the light?
What happened?
We couldn't wake you up.
Aren't you cold like that?
Where's Dylan?
In the room.
That room?
What's he doing there?
He wanted me to
join him, but...
I wanted to stay here with you.
Right.
Molly...
Are you sure?
This is what you
want, isn't it?
Ben...
What the fuck, what the fuck,
what the fuck did you do to me?
What did I do to you?
Fuck.
Who's there?
Dylan, is that you?
Dylan?
Dylan?
Ben, no.
Don't.
Man: I guess
you're ready to listen now.
What do I do?
Man: Listen good,
you gotta bring
But you gotta be careful,
it won't come willingly.
What about Will?
but don't let it sense your
intension, it senses things.
Hello?
Hello?
Will.
Do you wanna go for a ride?
Hey, Will.
You wanna put your boots on?
Come on, baby.
You and mommy can go
have some fun outside.
Yeah, come on, buddy.
Come on, you little devils!
Come on, you jolly fu--
' got ya!
Come here, Santa,
you fat bastard!
You again!
It's complete and utter chaos
down at the mall, police and
emergency cruiser on the scene,
we don't really know
what's going on,
still no word from
Stormin' Norman.
But I'm sure a crusty ol bird
like Norman will be fine.
We give Norman a hard
time around here,
but he's the weatherman, so...
I think he has a Master's Degree
from Colombia or something
depressing like that.
But we love him, so check in
as soon as you can, Normey.
In the meantime, it's my job to
keep the Christmas spirit alive
and that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.
Let's give this next
yuletide tune a spin.
Oh, man.
Hello?
Don't point that
thing at me, honey.
Put it down, it's okay.
I brought it.
Thanks.
What's the matter with you?
There's so many of them.
It's all right, they're not gonna
touch you as long as I'm here,
they're afraid of me.
I know how to herd them,
herd them good.
The trolls have been on
our land for generations.
I guess you could say
I watch over them.
Thanks for bringing
this one back,
it would've sensed me
coming from a mile away.
I brought it like you said.
Now where's my son?
I don't know.
What'd you do?
You keep running
off and now look
what you've done, now
look what you've done!
What are you doing,
where's my son?!
The little devils
never listen,
they never listen no matter
how many times I tell them.
What?
Where is he?
I want my son back!
I wish I could help,
but I can't, it's not up to me.
You lied to me!
It killed my husband!
Don't hurt it!
Put the gun--
No!
MY baby boy, please.
My son.
Oh, Will...
Mommy?
Come here!
Is that really you?
Oh, look at you, oh, God,
oh, baby.
on, baby.
- I got lost.
-Oh, it's okay, baby.
It's okay, it's okay, baby.
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay, baby.
Let's go home.
Ben: Dylan?
Molly!
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Dylan.
Ben: No.
Dylan...
Oh, God.
Grace wants me to carry her son.
Who?
That 15 year
old girl who tried
to get rid of her baby,
this is her room.
Molly, where are
you getting this from?
Connor and Jenna wouldn't
help her, but you and I did.
I'm going to have her child.
You brought us down here!
You fucked me!
You killed Dylan!
Molly! Molly!
Help me, Molly!
Aunt Etta!
Etta!
Etta, let me in!
Aunt Etta!
Etta!
Don't leave me out here!
Etta!
Etta, help me!
Merry Christmas, motherfucker!
It is almost dawn.
We will be safe.
Shouldn't we try and fix this
to trap him again.
Whatever do you mean?
Wasn't that how he got out?
When Duncan broke it?
Oh no, dear, this
is just an ornament.
Then how did
Gerhart turn into it?
Krampus is a Christmas spirit.
Like your father said...
The Christmas spirit
can fill anyone.
But if your heart is
blackened with anger
and vindictiveness,
then this spirit
will fill it until you
become a hellish beast.
A hunter of the wicked.
Gerhart's anger let it in and--
He came after us.
So you kicked Gerhart out
after you kicked us out.
Then you put the
cross on the door
to protect yourself
from Krampus, right?
Yes.
That's why you sent us away.
What?
You knew my fucked
up family would be
shark bait for that thing,
so you got rid of us.
Wait, it isn't
like that at all--
Sure it is!
You thought Gerhart
was gonna turn
so you sent us away knowing that
he would come after us.
You sacrificed us
for Krampus to save
your selfish old ass!
Oh, please, please,
now calm yourself.
You don't know the forces
that you are playing with.
Yes I do.
And I know something else.
You've been a bad girl.
Mother of God!
Police are telling
people just to stay away.
All right, just keep
clear of the mall.
I know a lot of you are worried
about your friends
and family, well the
best thing you can
do is just stay put.
And pray for a
Christmas miracle.
Still no word on
how many hostages
there may be down there, but...
Just stay at home.
For the love of God.
ls that you, dear?
Who's there?
Ah!
Martha, is that you?
Martha: Leave me alone.
It's safe now.
It's over.
Martha: It's not over!
Oh, my darling.
Who's there?
I knew it.
Krampus!
Vile enemy of Christmas.
We end this tonight.
Please don't kill me, Norman.
Norman?
Who's Norman?
What the fuck is
wrong with you, Norman?
- Leave me alone.
- Norman: It's only me.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
Fuck!
Ho ho ho!
It's time.
Cop: Freeze!
Put your hands up now!
Ahhh!
Dan". What the
hell is it about
in your hearts, you
hear me, people,
keep them close
and you treat them
every Christmas like
it might be your last.
What fun it is
To ride and sing
more police training,
then stuff like this--
You think,
more police can do
anything? Are you...
It's Christmas!
There are magical
dark forces out there.
People, wake up!
It's a beautiful
season, it's light
and it's dark and it's
ying and it's yang.
For our Asian friends out there,
you know who you are.
I said Asian, right?
I didn't say Oriental, right?
Well I don't know!
You tell me which is offensive.
I'm a Christmas expert.
It's 11 Lords a-leapin'
and ten maids a-milkin'.
No, no, no, don't go to...
Don't you Google that!
I hate it!
We as a society
can't go five minutes
without looking up a...
No wait a minute,
somebody's texting me.
It's 11 pipers piping,
I'm way off, I'm sorry.
Merry Christmas, everybody.
