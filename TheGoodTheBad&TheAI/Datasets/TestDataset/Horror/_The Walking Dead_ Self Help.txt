Previously on AMC's
The Walking Dead...
I was part of a 10-person team
at the Human Genome Project,
I believe we can take out every last
dead one of them.
Fire with fire.
We found a short bus out back.
- Now that we can take a breath...
- We take a breath, we slow down...
We all need to leave to DC, right now.
We saved you.
Well, I am trying to save yours.
Save everyone's.
Stay and help us. And we will go with you.
It's getting
a little messy for you.
Gettin' ady for retirement.
Relaxin' the grooming standards.
Thinkin' about
becomin' a plumber,
a sheepherder, or something.
You ain't herdin'
sheep now, Abraham.
Eyes on the prize.
Damn right.
That's my girl.
Maybe I'll let you
shave me down all over,
dolphin-smooth.
I'll cut it for you tonight.
Yes, ma'am.
Hey, maybe Rosita can give you
a trim while she's at it.
Party's getting a little
long in the back.
Or is it your source of power?
I ain't slayin' a lion
anytime soon.
I wouldn't be placing
any wagers on seein' me
dispatch a thousand Philistines
with the jawbone of an ass.
Tara: Oh, so you'll just settle
on saving the world, right?
Yeah.
What's up?
- Last night?
-
Yes, that and tomorrow.
And I'm thinking
about that preacher,
what he did.
Maybe they're just behind us.
Maybe Daryl and Carol came back.
Maybe they took the map,
found some cars,
and they're just down the road.
They'll catch up.
We're clearing the way for 'em.
Maggie:
After you get on that terminal
and do what you have to do?
Depends on a number of factors
including density
of the infected
around target sites worldwide.
Wait, target sites?
Are you talking about missiles?
That's classified.
Glenn: I thought
we were over that.
What if we all live?
They might.
including worldwide
weather patterns,
which were modeled
without the assumption
that cars, planes,
boats, and trains
wouldn't be pouring hydrocarbons
into the atmosphere this long.
Changed the game quite a bit
when it comes to
air-transmissible pathogens.
Why the hair?
Because I like it.
And no one is takin'
scissor or clipper to it
anytime soon. Do you
hear me, Miss Espinoza?
- Yes, loud and clear.
-
Eugene: Y'all can
laugh all you want.
Maggie:
The smartest man I ever met
happened to love my hair.
My old boss,
T. Brooks Ellis,
the director
of the Human Genome Project.
I just ain't Samson.
-
-
Abraham:
Ellen...
-
-
Eugene!
Eugene, are you okay?
The preacher...
didn't see another way out.
You hold on, okay?
- Glenn:
- Tara:
Rosita: The engine's on fire.
We gotta get out of here.
All right, you and I go
first, knock 'em back,
clear the way for Maggie
and Rosita to get out,
then we all start
hitting them, okay?
Yeah, all right.
We'll do it live.
- Tara?
- Yeah?
You cover Eugene,
come out when it's clear.
- Okay.
- On my go!
Go!
Come on. I know it
sucks and it's scary,
- but it's time to be brave.
- It isn't voluntary.
It is, when you're
screwed either way.
So you cut through the choice
that might help somebody.
I'm right behind you.
Whew.
Check Eugene, see if he's hurt.
I'm fine. Just cuts
and dings is all.
Check him!
- Maggie:
- Yeah.
Damn thing opened again.
I swear, the cuts
are finer than frog's hair.
They're just big bleeders.
Maggie:
I'll see what we have.
We're not stopping.
We're rolling on.
We'll find another vehicle
down the road.
The mission hasn't changed.
Devil's advocate,
nothing more--
we smashed to a stop hard.
We spent a lot of time rolling
things out of the road.
- The church is just 15 miles back that way--
- No.
We don't stop.
We don't go back.
We're at war,
and retreat means we lose.
You all know that.
Now, we will get through
this because we have to.
Every direction is a question.
We don't go back!
Hey, hey, hey.
You okay?
I am fit as a damn fiddle.
We are going with you.
You are calling this thing.
I just need to know you're good.
This is how things stop.
I can't afford that right now.
The world can't afford it.
Listen, I took a pretty hard shot
to the sack with that crash.
I am stressed and depressed
to see that ride die,
but if you say we're rolling on,
I'm good.
We're rolling on.
I'm gonna rub some dirt
on it and walk it off.
Yeah.
Rosita: We'll find what we
need like we always have--
- on the way.
- Okay.
I'm not rubbing dirt
on anything.
Maybe we can find some bis.
Bikes don't burn.
All right.
Right.
Rosita: Eugene,
what are you doing?
Nothing.
Rosita:
Ellen!
Ell...?
-
- Ellen.
Let's go.
I'm gonna take a sweep.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
Thank you.
For what?
For showing up.
It took a little horse
trading to get you here,
but it's plain
as potatoes to me now.
You get it.
Coulda lit out after the crash,
made a case, but you stayed.
- I made a deal.
- Yeah, you coulda broke it.
What was I gonna do?
You gonna put that thing
away tonight?
How about that?
You gonna wrap that up?
No, I'm gonna
let it get some air.
Got cut up pretty ugly last
night back at the church.
Yeah.
Gotten to the point where
everyone alive is strong now.
We have to be.
You're either strong and they
can help you so you help them
or you're strong
and they can kill ya.
So you gotta kill them.
You gotta kill them and...
I want to say it's never easy.
That's not the truth.
It's the easiest thing
in the world now.
The world's gonna change, right?
You're damn right it's gonna.
You'd better turn in.
You've got late watch.
Yeah.
I really need some ass first.
Didn't need to know
that, but, cool.
Abraham!
He's watching again.
Over there in the
self-help section.
- Abraham: "Self-help."
-
Abraham: Don't worry
about him, baby.
He's harmless.
- I'm already there.
- Come on.
Dude.
Cards on the table,
I watching them.
Yeah, I saw that.
I believe they know I catch
an eyeful on occasion,
which isn't to say it's their thing.
It's not mine either.
It's just that I enjoy
the female form
and I consider this
a victimless crime
that provides both
comfort and distraction.
Maybe, uh-- maybe we can
move on from here.
I was looking for you
to say thank you
for having my back at the bus.
You saved my life.
- Don't know about that.
- You did.
Well, if I did, then you provided
the context for me doing so.
- What?
- I was screwed either way,
so I went with the choice
that helped someone.
I thought it trite,
but it turned out to be true.
- Point to you.
- You have this.
Even if you didn't
before, you do.
Look, I'm--
I'm the same way.
You know you can do this.
Uh, did you hear
what I just said?
The bus crashed 'cause of me.
- No, it didn't.
- Yes, it did.
I put crushed glass
in the fuel line.
Light bulbs I found
in the church.
The vehicle should've failed
before it ever got to the road.
You would've killed us.
It wasn't supposed to go down
like that, not hardly, not half.
The glass wasn't supposed
to wear out the fuel line
next to the spark plugs.
We fully pulled
the short straw on that one.
What the hell?
Why did you do that?
Eugene, why did--
Eugene?
Why did you do that?
- Um...
- Answer me.
I appreciate
the positive affirmations
and looking the other way
on the perversion,
but I know empirically and definitively
I cannot survive on my own.
- I cannot.
- So you killed the bus?
If I don't cure the disease,
if I don't save the world,
I have no value.
- That's not how it works.
- If I don't fix things,
there's no way you people
would keep me around,
share resources,
even protect me.
Of course we would.
We're friends.
We have each other's backs.
That's it.
That's how it works.
Don't tell anyone else
what you did.
I'll keep your secret
and we'll keep going.
You know you messed up.
You're trying, but, dude,
you can't do something
like that again.
I won't.
You're stuck with us.
Just like we're stuck with you,
no matter what.
I don't know why I told you.
I do.
Welcome to the
human race, asshole.
Come on.
It's getting late.
Whew.
You thinkin' about them?
Yeah.
I feel guilty.
Hey.
Hey, we get to have...
little vacations
on bookstore floors.
We're not back there anymore.
We're living for something else.
And they don't get to right now.
Well, we did almost die today.
And we don't have a car.
And we're drinking toilet water.
It just feels
really good having this...
because it's not about what was.
Not last night.
It's all about what's gonna be.
Don't feel guilty about that.
Ellen.
I stopped 'em.
You don't have to be scared now.
Hey--
It's okay.
It's not infected.
You been going to nursing
school on the sly?
Roger and Pam taught me.
Mm.
I think we should
stay here today.
No.
You got some reading
you need to catch up on?
We got lucky yesterday.
But we're all banged up,
you especially.
We've been through worse.
We keep moving.
Maybe we always wind up stopping
because we never start at 100%.
Every minute we waste
getting him to Washington,
people are dying.
You think I don't
understand that?
After everything?
You see, I want us
to actually get there.
No, you want us to sit around.
You want us to stop.
Maggie: This town
isn't in bad shape.
This store wasn't even touched.
We could make a good base here.
We could spend one last day
doing a sweep for supplies.
We'll sweep as we go.
We've done it since Houston.
We're not stopping now.
You heard the lady.
We're taking it north.
Tara:
We tapped out the toilet.
Broad River is five miles west.
At the very least, we stock up
there before we find wheels.
We got a vehicle.
And it just so happens...
About time things
started going our way!
Come on.
Just once.
One damn time.
We'll find another ride.
If there was a ride worth a shit
in this town, we'd have seen it.
This thing's done
some crowd clearing.
Right up into the intake.
Which means we've got an air filter
filled with damn human remains.
And there is no damned corner
on this damned Earth
that has not been dicked hard
beyond all damned recognition.
- Abraham?
- What?
That feeds the radiator. The intake for
the engine is actually on the roof.
Tara, Maggie!
One damn time!
- One damn time!
- Rosita:
There's more from the back!
I been to eight county fairs
and one goat rodeo.
I never seen anything like that.
There was a Goodwill
over there by the bookstore.
It's pretty blown up, but there might be
some supplies, some dry clothes, maybe?
Not necessary.
I can clear that intake
in two shakes.
Then the engine
will get some wind
and so will we.
You'll air-dry.
We roll on.
What?
This shit is screwed up!
Ellen?
AJ?
Becca?!
Ellen!
Ellen!
-
- Come on.
I know why you have the haircut.
I told you,
it's 'cause I like it.
I believe that.
I like it, too.
I think you like it
for a reason.
You're not the person
people think you are.
You want 'em
to know who you are.
Not following you.
If you didn't have that mullet,
you'd probably be like
everybody else in the labs.
But you're not
like everybody else.
I think a lot of people
in your position
probably woulda given up,
but you didn't.
There were people-- a lot
of them along the way--
they made sure I didn't give up.
It wasn't me remotely.
It was.
You started this thing.
And you're not like Samson.
He was kind of a mess.
Not following you.
Well, his story goes...
that one day
when a lion attacked him,
God gave him strength
and he tore it apart.
Then he goes back one day,
he's by himself,
and he sees that bees have
made a hive in the carcass.
So later he tells
this riddle to people.
"Out of the eater,
something to eat.
Out of the strong,
something sweet."
And I always thought, "How the hell are
people supposed to know the answer
when it's just
about his own life?
When the only place the answer
is is in his own head?"
Glenn:
What?
Wind's picking up.
You're about to smell it.
-
- Maggie:
Whatever's making that stench,
it ain't nothin' nice.
We're not stoppin'.
Uh, we're stopped.
Let's go.
- Yeah.
- Abraham:
Abraham.
I will not abase.
Abraham, let's get out of here.
I will not give up the ship.
Hold up.
- Maggie: We gotta go.
- No.
No, we don't.
They can't hear us
and they can't see us.
Not from here.
We're fine.
Tara: Yeah, this is the
definition of fine."
Glenn: We need the map.
There's gotta be a detour.
I'm not doing it.
We detoured and detoured and
detoured from Houston to Georgia.
I'm not playing
that game anymore.
We are not going
through this, okay?
It isn't gonna happen.
You got a shitstorm
behind door A
and a storm of shit
behind door B.
If you're lucky, it's
walkers or a shot-up truck.
But sooner or later
you get cornered.
You wind up stayin'
and you wind up killin'.
We don't go back.
We can't go back.
I'm not talking
about going back.
- Just south a few miles.
- No.
Eugene: We already hit a full
stop 'cause of an air filter
compromised by innards.
That will happen again.
Then we'll hit 'em
with the hose.
Rosita: The tank
is empty, Abraham.
- If we floor it--
- We still hit them, they still slow us down,
and then they stop us.
I'm not saying
we just go straight.
That's the way the road goes.
- Abraham!
- We can get through!
I know it!
And that means
we are not going south,
going around, or going back!
Rosita:
They're right.
- Rosita: Hey, Abraham.
- Glenn: Hey! Hey!
- What are you doing? Stop.
- Glenn: Let go of him.
Rosita: I'm not gonna
let you do this.
- Yes, you are.
- Hey, hey, stop.
- Get out.
- Hey, you are done! You're done!
- Do not! Do not!
- Stop!
I told you, you do not touch me!
You do not touch me!
- Abraham!
-
Rosita:
I'm not a scientist!
I'm not a scientist!
I lied.
I'm not a scientist.
I don't know how to stop it.
I'm not a scientist.
You are a scientist. I've seen
the things that you can do.
I just know things.
You just...
"know things"?
I know I'm smarter
than most people,
I know I'm a very good liar,
and I know I needed
to get to DC.
Why?
Because I do believe that locale holds
the strongest possibility for survival,
and I wanted to survive.
If I could cheat some people
into taking me there,
well, I just reasoned that
I'd be doin' them a solid, too,
People died
trying to get you here.
I'm aware of that--
Stephanie, Warren, Pam,
Rex, Roger, Josiah,
Dirk, and Josephine.
And Bob.
You see, I lost my nerve
as we grew closer,
for I am a coward...
and the reality of
getting to our destination
and disclosing
e truth of the matter
became some
truly frightening shit.
I took it upon myself
to slow our roll.
Find time to finesse things
so then when we got there...
But at this moment,
I fully realize
there are no longer
any agreeable options.
I was screwed either way.
I also lied about T. Brooks
Ellis liking my hair.
I do not know
T. Brooks Ellis.
But I did read one of his
books, and he seemed like
the type of guy that wouldn't blink
twice at a Tennessee Top Hat.
Again...
I am smarter than you.
Now, you may want
to leave me here--
-
-
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey, come on!
- Get off of him!
-
- Maggie:
- Glenn: No.
Maggie:
Eugene?
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Eugene, are you there?
Abraham:
Eugene:
Help!
Help me!
Help me, please!
It's them.
Get 'em!
Get them.
Get 'em.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I think-- I think
they're gettin' faster.
Wait up!
Stop!
-
- Why?
I have a very important mission.
