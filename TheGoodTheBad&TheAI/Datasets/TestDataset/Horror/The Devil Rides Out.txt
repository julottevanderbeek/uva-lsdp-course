- Hello, Nicholas.
- Hello, Rex. How are you?
Fine. Fine.
Where's Simon?
When did you last see him?
- Three months ago.
- Three months?
- Do you think he's in trouble?
- Wouldn't he have told me?
Perhaps he told Richard
or Marie.
They haven't seen him
since Christmas.
Something MUST be wrong.
Let's go to his club.
He isn't there, Rex. He bought
a house, a large one.
- What on earth for?
- Exactly.
Do you know where it is?
Mr Simon Aron's house.
Mr Aron?
Good Lord.
- Nicholas!
- Simon.
- Rex!
- Hello, Simon.
What a wonderful surprise.
We apologise for
breaking in on your party.
Oh, it isn't a party.
It's just a meeting of a little...
astronomical society
I've joined.
Really?
Well, let me introduce you
to the members.
Countess, may I introduce
my friends?
The Duc de Richleau.
- Madame.
- Enchant√©e.
And Rex Van Ryn.
Countess D'Urfey.
- Madame.
- Monsieur.
Tanith? Mr Mocata?
I'd like to introduce you
to my friends.
The Duc de Richleau.
Mr Van Ryn, Miss Carlisle.
Mr Mocata.
It's a pleasure
to meet Simon's friends.
- Mademoiselle.
- Monsieur.
- Mr Van Ryn.
- We have met before.
Have we? I don't remember.
You joined an astronomical
society, Simon?
We were pleased
to welcome him.
Yes. It explains why I haven't
seen you for a few months.
And why you appear to have
forgotten our reunion tonight.
- Well, I was...
- Would you excuse me?
There's something
I must say to Simon.
- You're friends of Simon's?
- Yes, indeed, mademoiselle.
His father, Rex and I
were companions
in the Escadrille Lafayette.
Then when he died, you vowed
to keep an eye on Simon?
Yes.
When did you join this group?
We were never told that...
I don't understand. We're not
meant to be more than 13.
- We're not members.
- What?
We just stopped by
to see Simon...
Excuse me.
What's going on now?
We're going to be asked
to leave.
Move among the guests
and listen to what they say.
Rex, old friend.
I hate to say it,
but I have to throw you out.
The meeting's due to start.
But we must learn
to control them.
Control?
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.
An organisation...
Shall we have a good meeting?
If the weather improves,
we shall learn much.
His natal conjunction
will help immeasurably...
Two years ago in Berlin,
I experienced exactly
similar conditions.
That is most interesting...
Mars in conjunction
with Saturn, of course.
You mustn't call him Abraham
- until Deed Poll is executed.
- Why is that?
There's got to be
an initiation ceremony first...
This looks like a splendid wine,
Simon.
You always had excellent taste.
I feel dreadfully embarrassed.
I'd love to have you stay.
It's not an ordinary meeting,
you see,
and you and Rex
not being members...
Don't worry, my dear chap.
We understand perfectly.
- Don't we, Rex?
- Of course.
I feel terrible about
missing our reunion.
We must get together soon.
Perhaps tomorrow?
Simon, I see you've got
an observatory.
I'm very interested
in astronomy.
I'd like to look through
your telescope.
I'll only be five minutes.
What do you want to look
at his blasted telescope for?
I don't.
Simon, those charts.
They're not astronomical,
are they?
Good Lord, no.
They're just for decoration.
Relics, Middle-Ages nonsense,
you know.
It's clever of you to extend
the decorative scheme to the floor.
Yes.
If you'd like to see the...
Sounds like mice.
You have to go now.
What in the name of...?
You fool!
I'd rather see you dead
than meddling
with black magic!
Let go of me.
I didn't ask you
to come here tonight.
Even my oldest friends
have no right
to butt in on my private affairs.
- Will someone please...?
- I'm sorry, Simon.
I feel like a father
who sees his child picking
live coals out of a fire.
Will someone tell me
what's going on?
Chickens in a basket,
diagrams on a floor.
Do these mean something
to you?
It means that Simon is playing
the most dangerous game
known to mankind.
- Oh, come on, Nicholas.
- You're making too much of it.
You've no objection if we stay?
You aren't members
of the circle.
- Circle?
- Society.
If we stayed, there'd be more
than 13, wouldn't there?
Simon, you will admit that,
whilst Rex and I have been
your closest friends
for ten years,
we have never stressed our
age or our greater experience.
Tonight, I'm going
to break that rule.
I'm considerably older
than you are, Simon,
and I've made a deep study
of these esoteric doctrines.
I beg of you,
as I've never begged anything
in my life before,
give up this dangerous
adventure
and leave this house
with us immediately.
- I can't.
- Then, let us stay.
Impossible.
Put him down there, Rex.
Thank you, Max.
Can you wait outside?
I wonder what
he's going to say.
Nothing. I'm bringing him round
to put him to sleep again.
Makes as much sense
as anything else tonight.
Tilt the lampshade
towards me, Rex.
Look into the mirror, Simon.
Look into the mirror.
Keep looking
and listen to me.
You have been hurt
and your mind is troubled.
But you are with your friends now,
and there is nothing more
to worry about.
I'm going to send you to sleep,
Simon.
Your eyes will close
as soon as I touch them.
You will wake up at
ten o'clock tomorrow morning.
Your mind will be free
from all pain
and from all anxiety.
Open your eyes, Simon.
Stand up.
I'm going to place this symbol
of protection round your neck.
Once it is there,
you will not remove it.
You will go directly
to my bedroom,
where you will lie down
and fall into an immediate sleep.
Max?
Show Mr Aron to my room.
- Thank God that's over.
- I might agree with you,
if I knew what
you were talking about.
We can certainly make
good use of these.
To our reunion, Rex.
- No questions?
- Hocus-pocus.
Mumbo-jumbo. Black magic?
Rex, do you believe in evil?
As an idea.
Do you believe
in the power of darkness?
- As a superstition.
- Now, there you are wrong.
The power of darkness
is more than a superstition.
It is a living force
which can be tapped
at any given moment of the night.
These people
are Devil worshippers.
That's ridiculous.
These are facts, Rex,
not superstition.
The proof was in the hamper.
They were about to practise
the sacrifice to their master -
the slaughter of a black
cockerel and a white hen.
Yes?
I thought I'd better
bring this to you, Excellency.
- My God!
- He's all right now, sir.
- Did you remove this, Max?
- Yes, sir.
- Why?
- It was choking him to death.
He rang for me. His face was
black, his tongue protruding.
- I should have known.
- I'm sorry, sir...
It's not your fault.
We can only hope
that he's gone to his house.
Shall I look upstairs
while you try down here?
- It's better we stay together.
- Rubbish.
Don't worry. I'll scream
if I so much as smell anything.
All right.
Well?
Not a sign. You?
He's not here.
Unless...
Up there.
It's possible.
Is it getting colder
or is it my imagination?
No.
It isn't your imagination.
At least we saved your lives.
But no Simon.
No. It might help us locate him
if we knew the real names
of those people tonight.
- Real names?
- Yes.
In order to become a follower
of the so-called Left Hand Path,
one has to be rebaptised
in the cause
and take the name of some
past notable of the occult.
That girl, for instance -
Miss Carlisle.
- I have seen her before.
- You have? Where?
Biarritz, at the casino.
She was with that old woman,
the cigar-smoker.
Simon called her Tanith.
So?
Tanith is the name of the Moon
Goddess of the Carthaginians.
You mean
she's been rebaptised?
Probably.
Let's see what we can find,
and get out of here.
What is it?
Fantastic!
- The Clavicule Of Solomon.
- Valuable?
Invaluable.
What's it made of, cork?
It's cold.
My God!
Don't look at the eyes, Rex.
Don't look at the eyes.
Don't pull away!
Try to hold back.
Fundamenta ejus
in montibus sanctis.
Run!
Oh, I take back
everything I said.
I've never been so scared
in all my life.
- I'm sorry, Rex.
- Sorry? For saving my life?
I should never have
allowed you in that place.
Forget it. We're out.
That's all that matters.
- Wasn't very pleasant, was it?
- Pleasant?
What in God's name was that?
Some infernal spirit
given entry into the world
by Mocata's powers.
Mocata is one of the great adepts,
even an lpsissimus.
- A what?
- An lpsissimus.
A master of the highest grade.
Simon is in his hands.
He's about to be baptised
into the service of evil.
- When does it take place?
- Baptism must take place
on a true Sabbat, with at least
one coven of 13 believers.
I can't believe they would dare
hold another meeting, unless...
What is it, Nicholas?
Do you realise
what today's date is, Rex?
April the, er...29th. Why?
Mocata isn't going to miss
the chance of giving Simon
his Devil's baptism at
the grand Sabbat of the year.
- What are you talking about?
- Tomorrow night.
The eve of May Day.
In 24 hours, Simon could
be lost to us for ever.
- What can we do?
- We find the girl.
Thank you. Goodbye.
It's all right, Rex.
- I found her.
- Where?
In a London hotel,
the London Plaza.
I never knew there were
so many hotels in London.
- It was the 28th one I tried.
- You should have woken me.
Just as well you slept.
You need to be more alert today
than any day of your life.
- Let's go, then.
- You'll have to go alone, Rex.
It's vital I go
to the British Museum
to examine certain
occult volumes.
The curator's a friend of mine.
Do you want me
to bring Tanith here?
No.
I want you to keep her as far away
from London as possible.
Well, what if I take her
to Richard's house?
Yes. Perfect. I'll telephone to say
you're on your way down.
I'll see you there about three.
It should give you
plenty of time.
We'll be there. Oh...
- May I borrow a car?
- Yes. Take any of them.
Thanks.
What do you have
to say to me?
I haven't much time
before we leave.
- "We"?
- The Countess and I.
- We're travelling together.
- To the...Sabbat?
Of course. Couldn't you
have spoken to me there?
In front of Mr Mocata?
I'm hoping that
whatever you have to say
has nothing to do
with my loyalty to him.
- It doesn't.
- What is it, then?
Well, it's just...
I just wanted
to take you to lunch.
- If you're free, that is.
- Take me to lunch?
Does that sound
such a bad idea?
Mr Van Ryn,
you know that neither of us
is free to give our lives
to such things.
Why not let me
be the judge of that?
I think you'd better
drive me back.
Mr Van Ryn?
Don't ever do that again.
What has Mocata done
to make you so afraid of him?
It's what he'll do.
Oh, God!
It's what he'll do!
- Where are you taking me?
- To see de Richleau.
Look, there's nothing
to be afraid of.
You know better than that.
If I'm not at the Sabbat...
- Is that so important to you?
- My satanic baptism?
You haven't been rebaptised yet?
But your name, Tanith?
- I was named that at birth.
- Then you have a chance.
Chance?
De Richleau can help you.
Believe me, Tanith. He can.
I've known him for many years.
If there's anyone
you can trust, it's him...
'Tanith?
'Look at me, Tanith.
In the mirror.
'Listen carefully to what I say.'
...nothing to worry about,
once we get to Richard
and Marie in the country.
- In the country?
- Yes. Where we're going.
Haven't you been listening?
Yes. I've been listening.
Peggy! Run and wash
your hands, will you?
Oh, Mummy! Must I?
Oh, Peggy! Yes, you must.
Uncle Rex will be here
in a minute.
Won't he have to wash
his hands?
Yes, I expect so.
Why can't I wait till Uncle Rex
comes, then go and wash?
- Then I won't be late.
- Off!
- And take that hat off.
- It's to protect my head.
We're having a picnic luncheon,
not a gymkhana.
If I fall over
and split my head open...
It's my fault and I'll be
very sorry. Now, hurry.
She'll go like a bird now.
This must be Rex
and his mysterious woman.
- There's a car coming!
- Probably be Uncle Rex.
- Uncle Rex!
-  Careful!
Uncle Rex!
- Uncle Rex!
- Hello, Peggy.
Marie.
Richard.
I must take your car.
Simon's life depends on it.
He didn't stay long, did he?
'Do not be afraid.
I'm still with you.
'He will never catch you.
'Listen, Tanith.
'Listen and obey.'
Eko, eko, Adonai.
Eko, eko, Adonai.
Eko, Babalon.
Eko, Babalon.
Eko, Osiris.
Eko, Osiris.
Hello?
Rex? What?
It's started. I couldn't phone earlier.
I'd have lost them.
Where are you?
Crossroads.
Yes? Yes?
Yes, I've got that. Listen.
You're not to do anything until
I get there, anything at all.
Right.
Three turns to the left,
then one to the right.
- It has a very rough surface.
- Well done, Rex.
- Take these.
- What are they?
The results of my research
at the British Museum.
- Put one in each pocket.
- May I ask what they are?
Salt and mercury.
They will protect you and Simon.
- If we can save him.
- And you?
I have other protection.
There.
We must get them out of here.
- Them?
- Tanith, too.
Tanith is her real name.
- This is her baptism as well.
- We'll do what we can.
Baphomet!
Baphomet! Baphomet!
Baphomet! Baphomet!
Baphomet!
My God!
The Goat of Mendes.
The Devil himself.
- Let go!
- It's not your life you're risking.
It's your very soul! Oh, God!
If only there was some light!
That's it. That's it!
I'll drive.
You get on the running board.
Kneel and face your master.
Throw that in the face
of that damned monstrosity.
- Right.
- God help us, then.
Whoso dwelleth under
the defence of the most high
shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty.
Come on, Simon.
Hell of a way to turn up
on their doorstep,
after not having seen them
since Christmas.
Good morning, Your Grace.
Good morning, Malin. Are my niece
and her husband up yet?
Yes, sir. Won't you come in?
Rex and Uncle Nicholas!
What's the matter?
You all look so ghastly.
I'll explain, but first,
rooms for Miss Carlisle and Simon.
They're both badly
in need of sleep.
- Yes, of course.
- No, I mustn't.
Do as I say, my dear.
Everything's going to be all right.
- Marie.
- Yes. This way.
- Simon.
- I want to hear what you say.
And to make my apologies
to you all.
Very well.
Rex, you stay with Tanith.
And if anything happens,
you call me immediately.
You could do with
some sleep yourself.
He could.
He's been up all night.
I'll take a nap later,
but now, we must talk.
- Bring us some coffee, Malin.
- Yes, sir.
There.
I'll go before it's night again.
You stay as long as you like.
No, no. I'll go before it's night.
You try and get
some sleep now.
Oh, Rex. What's this all about?
Well...
Your uncle will explain.
I wouldn't know where to start.
Go to sleep. I'll be here.
Promise me.
Promise.
I don't want to harm any of you.
No.
Why couldn't we have met
some other way?
- The way doesn't matter.
- It does.
It does.
Does your friend possess
any powers to resist Mr Mocata?
We got you out of that bedlam
last night, didn't we?
You've got nothing
to worry about.
I have everything
to worry about.
You're quite serious
about all this?
Deadly serious.
It's all true, Richard. All of it.
God knows I wish it wasn't.
- None of us may eat today?
- Fruit. A biscuit or two.
- Some water.
- And no alcohol?
- I'm sorry.
- That is, if we're to stay.
- Of course you're staying.
- But the danger?
You think we'd let you
face it alone?
You mean you believe all this?
Well, I'm damned.
You will find a talk with Rex
most valuable, Richard.
His scepticism was fully
the equal of yours.
- Now he believes?
- Ask him.
How can we help?
You're already helping, my dear.
Simon's resistance
is practically nil.
He's been under the influence
of Mocata for so long.
The same applies to Miss Carlisle.
Rex and I are at a very low ebb
after last night.
Your coming fresh to the battle
is of paramount importance.
I've got to leave you all
for a short while.
I'll be back before nightfall.
Richard, I want you to sit
with Simon while he sleeps.
You are not to allow him to get up,
under any circumstances.
Once he gets his head down...
Under any circumstances.
All right.
He is not to be left alone
for an instant.
You understand?
Not for an instant.
Good morning. I would like
to see Mrs Eaton, please.
- Here's my card.
- Please wait here, sir.
There's a gentleman
to see you, madam. Mr Mocata.
Well, you'd better call Mr...
No. Wait a minute.
I'll see him in the library.
And Malin, if I ring, come at once.
You understand? Immediately.
Yes, madam.
Will you come this way, sir?
Thank you.
Please forgive me for calling
without an introduction.
I'm here on an errand of goodwill.
Goodwill?
I'm returning the property
of a friend of yours,
the Duc de Richleau -
his motorcar.
- Oh. Thank you.
- May I introduce myself?
Mocata.
Perhaps you've heard my name?
I've heard a great deal about you.
Oh. I thought
that might be the case.
Whether the facts have been
correctly represented to you
is something else again.
May I, er...?
Very well, but please be brief.
Of course.
I shan't intrude a moment longer
than is necessary.
Well, now,
as you probably know,
Miss Tanith and Simon
are very close friends of mine.
- Indeed?
- Yes.
I believe they're here now.
Is that correct?
How did you know that,
Mr Mocata?
They arrived a short while ago.
That is neither
here nor there.
The point is,
there are certain matters,
of which you are unaware,
which make it imperative
that I take them back
to London immediately.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I feared you would
take that attitude.
The Duc de Richleau
has filled your mind
with preposterous nonsense
about me.
I know that what he said is true.
Tanith and Simon could be
in considerable...danger
if they do not
leave this house.
On the contrary.
They will be safe nowhere else.
Mrs Eaton, it's obvious
that you distrust me.
After what your friends have
told you, I'm not surprised.
However, your obvious intelligence
emboldens me to think that
I will serve my purpose best
by, er...putting my cards
on the table, as it were.
- There is no more to be said.
- Please?
Hear me out.
Dear lady.
I do not propose to discuss
with you the rights and wrongs
of practising the Magic Art.
I will confine myself to saying
that I am a practitioner
of some experience.
Monsieur de Richleau has,
no doubt, led you to believe
that I am thoroughly evil.
Such is not the case.
In magic,
there is neither good nor evil.
It is merely a science,
the science of causing...
change to occur
by means of one's will.
The sinister reputation
attaching to it
is entirely groundless
and is based on superstition,
rather than
objective observation.
The power of the will
is something
people do not understand,
attributing to it mysterious
qualities it does not possess,
being merely the power
of mind over matter,
or in the greater number of cases,
the power of mind over mind.
As your mind
is succumbing to mine.
For, as you look into my eyes
and listen to my voice,
your will is leaving you,
slipping away-
You are now beneath
my influence.
Although your eyes are open
and you seem aware,
you are, in fact, asleep,
your faculties dormant,
your abilities to act and think
subservient to my will.
My will.
Mrs Eaton,
my will is yours at this point.
You cannot function
in the least, unless I say so.
Can you?
Answer me, Mrs Eaton.
No.
Where is Simon?
Upstairs.
- Alone?
- My husband is watching him.
And Tanith?
- Upstairs.
- Alone?
No. Rex is with her.
Mummy, would you come...?
Get out of this house,
do you hear me?
I want the girl and Simon.
- Show him out.
- I am leaving.
I shall not be back.
But something will.
Tonight, something will come
for Simon and the girl.
- Richard, what's happened?
- Nothing.
Apart from an attempt
to strangle me.
What?
He woke up, tried to choke me
then went back to sleep.
Mocata, he was here.
Why didn't you tell me?
Uncle Nicholas said that
Simon must not be left alone.
Better see if Rex is all right.
Rex.
Rex, wake up. She's gone.
What are you trying to do?
What's the matter, Tanith?
We'll go back.
No. I'm not going back there.
Why not?
I almost killed you.
Mocata was there.
- Mocata?
- He came for me and Simon.
But he didn't succeed.
He won't give up.
Can't you see?
I can't go back there.
He'll make me do something
terrible to you and your friends.
I don't want to hurt you.
I don't want to hurt any of you.
All right. All right.
We won't go back. We'll find
somewhere safe until morning.
I saw you coming.
You look terribly tired.
Uncle Nicholas...
- Mocata's been here.
- What?
- He returned your car.
- He didn't harm you?
- No...
- Where's Simon?
- Asleep.
- You're sure?
- Richard's watching him.
- What about the girl?
- She's gone.
- Gone?
Rex is with her. He telephoned
but he wouldn't say where.
Fool! Doesn't he realise yet
what we're up against?
She ran away.
Rex went after her.
Why on earth didn't he bring
her back here, then?
He explained on the phone.
It's through Tanith that
Mocata makes his attacks.
She's his medium.
She doesn't want to be close to us.
Then why is Rex with her?
To try and prevent Mocata
from gaining control over her.
Pray God he can.
As long as it's light,
it may be possible.
But once the darkness
begins to fall...
It's nearly dark.
- Where's Simon?
- Saying good night to Peggy.
What do you want
to do about supper?
Water, Richard. Just water.
All right.
- God bless you, my angel.
- Good night, Mummy.
Good night.
I've cleared the furniture
out of the drawing room,
- as you requested.
- Thank you, Malin.
You're to stay with Miss Peggy
until I tell you otherwise.
Now, to work.
All right now?
He must be getting weaker.
He's been attacking you
all afternoon.
No. He won't stop.
It's too important for him.
Why doesn't he come at me
with a gun?
He never risks himself
in any way.
I believe that, but this isn't
doing him any good.
What now?
Now, we wait.
No.
Frankly, I think we're behaving
like a pack of idiots.
- It begins.
- What?
What begins?
Mocata is working on you.
You are the weakest link.
- I...
- From his point of view.
You are the sceptical one.
He is looking for an easy way
to break the circle.
Come on!
ls there anything I could say
that you wouldn't interpret
in your own suspicious way?
- Richard.
- Well, it's all superstition.
Black magic.
Hell! I'm going for a drink.
Richard!
You and I have been friends
for many years, haven't we?
- I don't follow you
- If I begged you,
for the sake of that friendship,
to do something, would you?
- You know I would.
- Very well.
Will you stay with me
in the circle tonight?
You are unafraid. I am not.
It's a pretty low trick,
appealing to friendship.
Will you stay?
What else can I do?
I wish we had some water.
- We have.
- What?
There.
Yes.
Where do you get
your water from? A swamp?
- Taste it.
- No. Don't touch it.
- I'll get some fresh.
- No!
That's exactly
what he wants you to do.
What is it?
I'm not certain, but...
What?
The lights.
What about the lights?
- They seem to be dimmer.
- No, they're not.
Yes.
I don't know what you're...
- It's getting colder.
- This is to be expected.
It's only the beginning.
Get up quickly!
Back-to-back. Join hands.
Easy, darling. It's all over now.
What's going on?
Let me in.
Stay still.
No!
Come on.
It's cold out here. Let me in.
- We must let him in.
- Who? You think that's Rex?
Let me in.
Let me in.
What's that?
Don't leave the circle!
There's a light in the hall.
Peggy!
- No, Marie!
- Peggy! Let me go! Run!
- It's not Peggy.
- You're out of your mind.
Simon!
-
- I tell you, it's not Peggy!
- Let go of me!
- She's upstairs, asleep.
I won't!
Do you hear me? I won't!
Simon! No! No, Simon!
Back-to-back. Quickly.
Can't we do anything
but just stand here?
Isn't there any way
of fighting back?
- Only one.
- What?
The last two lines
of the Sussamma Ritual.
What are you waiting for?
I daren't use them
until our very souls are in peril.
It would destroy us as effectively
as it stops Mocata.
It can alter time and space...
What is it?
He has given up
trying to get Simon.
He has sent
the Angel of Death to claim him.
And us?
If he once breaks into the circle.
If we once catch sight of his face.
- For God's sake, say it!
- I can't.
Richleau!
Uriel seraphim. Eo potesta.
Zati, Zata. Galatim, Galatah!
- It's over?
- Yes, Simon. It's all over.
- She's dead.
- I know, Rex.
The Angel of Death
was summoned.
He cannot return empty-handed.
I'll go and see how Peggy is.
Miss Peggy, she's gone.
- What?
- What happened?
Suddenly,
a darkness came over me.
I couldn't see. There was nothing
I could do, I swear it.
I know, Malin.
No.
Oh, my God!
He's got her, hasn't he?
Simon!
Don't try to follow him.
Mocata knows he's coming.
- To follow would be suicide.
- How will we find Mocata?
Before me, Raphael.
Behind me, Gabriel.
On my right hand, Michael.
On my left hand, Auriel.
In the name
of these mighty spirits,
I conjure you, Tanith,
wherever you may be.
Join us in this circle
that you may speak with us.
With salt, I summon thee.
With hair, I summon thee.
With blood, I summon thee.
The sign of Osiris slain.
The sign of Osiris risen.
You have called me.
I am here.
Are you in truth Tanith?
I am.
Do you acknowledge our Lord,
Jesus Christ?
I do.
Did you come here
of your own free will?
I came
because you summoned me.
I came willingly.
There is one here whose grief
at your passing is very great.
He has agreed that
you will be summoned back
only in the hope that you will
protect his friends from evil.
Will you help him?
I will...because I love him.
Then tell us where Mocata is.
- I do not know.
- Try to find him.
I cannot see him clearly.
He covers himself
with a cloak of darkness.
- I see the child, a little girl.
- Where?
- I cannot enter.
- You must.
I cannot. The winged serpent
guards the way.
- I cannot enter.
- Where?
- I cannot see.
- You must see.
You must enter.
I command you to enter.
No. Please.
He is in there, the dark one.
Please, don't make me enter.
- You must enter.
- No.
- No, please.
- I command you to enter.
- No!
- Yes! Now!
- I cannot!
- Stop it!
You fool! You damned fool!
- She's all right.
- You might have killed her.
A winged serpent
guarding the way?
But where?
On the gates of that house.
Welcome back, my son.
All right. I'm back.
- You can release the child.
- Yes, I have you back.
Now I don't have to release
the child, do I?
What do you mean? You...
- You have no use for her.
- Ah, but I do, my son.
A most...important use.
I have you back.
Now, the only one I need is Tanith.
- You wouldn't...
- Dare?
Take your place.
Now that our coven of 13
has been restored,
we can begin the ceremony.
Bring in the child.
Whatever you see,
whatever happens, stay close to me.
God knows what we will find.
Almighty and all-powerful Set,
father of darkness,
king of death,
I pledge this knife to you...
Rex! No, Richard! No.
Mocata!
Welcome to our circle.
What have you done to my baby?
She does not hear you.
She's in a state of deep hypnosis.
In the name of God,
you dare not!
Scarcely in the name of God,
Monsieur le Duc.
What's he going to do with her?
Uncle?
Take me instead, Mocata.
You, Monsieur le Duc?
Your soul in preference
to that of an unstained child?
- What are you talking about?
- He isn't going to...?
Yes. The transference of souls.
That of your child
for that of Tanith.
No!
Now, if our two remaining guests
will permit,
we may proceed.
Almighty and all-powerful Set,
father of darkness,
king of death,
I pledge this knife to thee,
to do thy work...
...and be thy servant.
Those words you said before,
say them again.
..the blood of this child...
- I cannot.
- You must.
My baby's going to die
if you don't.
You must speak
those words again.
The bride of chaos.
The bride of chaos.
- The rider upon the beast.
- The rider upon the beast.
With this knife
do I draw out the blood
which is thy life.
Only they who love
without desire
shall have power granted them
in the darkest hour.
Peggy, get up.
Repeat after me the words
of the Sussamma Ritual.
Uriel seraphim.
Uriel seraphim.
- Eo potesta.
- Eo potesta.
- Zati, Zata.
- Zati, Zata.
Galatim, Galatah.
It's over?
Yes, Simon. It's all over.
Oh.
Peggy.'-
Wasn't...?
Tanith?
Come in, my friends.
She's all right. Tanith!
Time itself has been
reversed for us.
Tanith's death,
Peggy's abduction,
the ride to Chilbury,
the ritual in the cellar,
all these things happened.
But now,
they have not happened.
We are back.
- We are all safe again.
- And is Mocata also safe?
You will remember what I said
about the Angel of Death.
- Once summoned...
- Cannot return empty-handed.
Exactly.
Tanith has been restored to us,
but the age-old law
demands a life for a life,
a soul for a soul.
There is only one man
in all this world
who can replace her life, her soul.
The man who invoked
the Angel of Death.
Mocata is dead.
- Thank God.
- Yes, Simon.
He is the one we must thank.
