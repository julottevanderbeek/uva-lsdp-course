Keep it up! Let's go!
Teamwork! Keep playing!
- Hit it to Carrie! She'll blow it!
- Don't blow it, Carrie! Hit it!
- Carrie...!
- She blew it again!
- We almost had the game!
- We can't win with her on the team.
Look at her! Just standing there!
You eat shit!
Help me! Help me!
Help me!
Help me! Help me!
Have a Tampax!
Help me!
Help me! Help me!
Help me!
Gross! Gross!
Here! Plug it up! Plug it up!
Plug it up! Plug it up!
Plug it up! Plug it up!
Plug it up! Plug it up!
What is going on here?
This isn't a pep rally!
Plug it up! Plug it up!
- Sue! What are you doing?!
- Carrie... she's just got her period.
- Who's got her period?
- Carrie.
What are you doing?!
Plug it up! Plug it up!
Carrie...
Carrie, quit it! Come on.
Stop it! Now relax! Calm down.
Listen to me.
It's OK. It's OK. Just stand up
and take care of yourself. Come on.
Grow up. Stand up and take care
of yourself. Come on, do it. Do it.
- Did you see that?
- No...!
Get outta here. Go on. Right now. Move!
Carrie...
Carrie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't know, OK? I'm sorry.
Baby, come on, now. Don't you know?
Listen, listen.
I'm gonna talk to you about it.
Now just calm down. Just relax.
See? They're all gone. They're all gone.
It's gonna be OK.
- Isn't she a bit old for her, uh...
- Her first period.
Yes.
Morty, until a half-hour ago, I don't even
think she knew there was such a thing.
Hard to believe in this day and age a girl
in high school wouldn't know something.
- Facts...
- Well, she didn't.
But I don't know why that should
surprise us, knowing that mother of hers.
- We can't interfere with people's beliefs.
- I know.
- As for the girls...
- She's their scapegoat.
- You'll have to do something.
- I will.
But see, the thing is, Morty, that, um...
I knew how they felt.
The whole thing just made me
wanna take her and shake her too.
- It was just her period, for God's sake!
- Well, we'll send her home.
- Miss Finch, send in Cassie Wright.
- It's Carrie White.
- Come in, Cassie.
- Carrie.
Miss Finch, would you
bring in a dismissal slip?
I thought you might take
the rest ofthe day and...
...go home, take care of yourself, Cassie.
We're all very sorry about this incident.
It's Carrie.
Thank you.
- Would you like to go to the infirmary?
- I think Carrie can go home.
Would you like a ride?
We could call you a cab.
I'm sure she can walk home.
And, Carrie, you're dismissed from gym
for a week. Just take study hall instead.
- We're all sorry about this, Cassie.
- It's Carrie!
Creepy Carrie! Creepy Carrie! Ha-ha!
-
-
-
-
Mrs White.
- How have you been, Mrs Snell?
- Fine.
- And the doctor?
- Fine.
- And your daughter?
- Sue is... fine.
- Won't you come in, Mrs White?
- Oh, how kind of you.
- Carrie is in some of Sue's classes.
- Yes.
- Perhaps sometime she'd like to visit.
- I'm here on the Lord's work, Mrs Snell.
Spreadin' the gospel of God's salvation
through Christ's bless.
- Yes, of course.
- I have something...
...I know is gonna interest
the doctor and you.
I don't think Sue would be very interested.
The children are wandering through the
wilderness of sin these days, Mrs Snell.
- My Sue is a good girl.
- These are godless times, Mrs Snell.
I'll drink to that!
- We'll... all read these.
-
Excuse me. Please sit down, Mrs White.
Hello?
Betty, can I call you back?
Margaret White is here.
White.
Just let me get rid of her
and I'll call you right back.
I have something here, Mrs Snell,
that I think you might profitfrom.
Mrs White, I'd like to contribute five...
Ten dollars.
I see.
I pray you find Jesus.
Right.
Wasn't that Carrie White's mother?
- Hey, I didn't hear you come in.
- What'd she want?
Yes?
Yes?
Thank you.
I know you're listening.
Come on downstairs.
Mama?
Who was that... called?
You're a woman now.
Why didn't you tell me, Mama?
"And God made Eve
from the rib of Adam."
"And Eve was weak and
loosed the raven on the world."
"And the raven was called sin." Say it.
Why didn't you tell me, Mama?
- Say it.
- No.
- The raven was called sin.
- And the raven was called sin!
"And first sin was intercourse."
- First sin was intercourse.
- I didn't sin, Mama.
- Say it!
- I didn't sin, Mama!
The first sin was intercourse.
First sin was intercourse.
And the first sin was intercourse!
I was so scared, I thought I was dyin'.
The girls, they all laughed at me, Mama.
- "And Eve was weak." Say it.
- No, Mama!
- Eve was weak.
- No!
- Eve was weak. Say it, woman.
- No, Mama!
- Say it!
- Eve was weak! Eve was weak.
"And the Lord visited Eve with a curse.
And the curse was the curse of blood!"
You should have told me, Mama!
You should have told me.
O Lord! Help this sinning woman
see the sin of her days and ways.
Show her that if she had remained sinless
the curse would never have come on her.
She may be tempted by the Antichrist.
She may have had lustful thoughts...
- No, Mama!
- Don't lie, Carrietta!
Don't you know I can see inside you?
I can see the sin as surely as God can!
- You're hurtin' me.
- We'll pray!
- We'll pray, woman!
- No!
Pray to Jesus for our lustful, sinnin' souls.
"God visited Eve with a curse.
And the curse was the curse of blood."
No, Mama!
"And he visited Eve with a second curse.
And this was the curse of childbearing."
"And Eve broughtforth Cain
in sweat and blood."
Genesis 3:16!
Mama! Let me out! Mama, please!
Let me out! Mama, please!
Let me out, Mama! God...!
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...
Thank you, Mama.
You can go to bed now.
" There is power, power,
wonder-working power
" In the blood ofthe Lamb
Carrie?
Carrie?
Carrie?
Carrie? Carrie...
- Open the door.
- It's open, Mama.
- What was that noise?
- What noise?
- Go to bed.
- Yes, ma'am. Sayin' my prayers.
"What are you
going to leave for us,
You people in your big cars
spewing pollution into the air?"
-
-
"You people with heavy feet,
trampling down the wilderness?
You people who peer into
the back seats of our cars
Hours after you come out of
the back doors of your motels?
Soon all we will have is each other
And that could be enough,
If you will let us have
room enough and air enough
And peace enough to love each other
As you never could."
I really must say... I must confess...
...this poem displays
the most extraordinary talent.
Atalent extraordinary for
Tommy Ross.
You know, this is slightly differentfrom
running touchdowns or hitting home runs.
Class, any criticisms?
Anyone?
- It's beautiful.
-
Carrie White! Beautiful.
Beautiful.
- Beautiful!
-
"O beautiful for spacious skies,
For amber waves of grain."
Is that the beautiful you mean?
Is it, Carrie, hmm?
Well, I'm afraid this is hardly a criticism.
You suck.
Tommy? Did you say something?
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.
I said "Aw, shucks."
- Roll call: Blake.
- Present.
- Bourne.
- Here.
OK, line up.
Line up!
Move it!
On your feet, right now! Two lines!
Alice and Mary, eyes front.
Katie...
You too, Chris.
And spit out that gum.
- Where'll I put it?
- You can choke on itfor all I care.
Just get it out of your mouth.
Wipe that smirk off your face, Norma.
OK. Now I want you all to know that
you did a really shitty thing yesterday.
Did any of you ever stop to think
that Carrie White has feelings?
Do any of you ever stop to think?
No, I guess you're too busy
thinking about your dates and the prom.
I guess you can take your pick, Chris.
Who's the lucky guy?
Billy Nolan.
- Who?
- Billy Nolan.
- I'm sorry, could you speak up?
- Billy Nolan!
Well, isn't he the lucky one!
What about you, Sue?
- Who's taking you?
- Tommy Ross.
Right.
Now, my idea for this little trick you pulled
was three days' suspension...
...and refusal of your prom tickets.
- What?!
- God!
That'd get you where you live,
wouldn't it? And you deserve it.
I don't think any of you have any idea
of just how nasty what you did really was.
But the office has decided
you're to have one week's detention.
Still, there's one little catch.
It's to be  detention.
That's 50 minutes every day,
starting today, on the athletic field.
- Get the picture?
- I'm not coming.
That's up to you, Chris.
That's up to all of you.
Punishmentfor skipping detention
is three days' suspension...
...and refusal of your prom tickets.
Any other thoughts?
Good. Now change up.
Where are you going?
- Where you going?
- Come on.
- I'm not coming.
- You're really not gonna come?
- I'm not coming.
- Well, you're gonna miss the prom.
Fuck!
And... One, two, three, four.
Two, two, three, four.
Energy, Norma! Come on!
Stretch, Norma, stretch!
Faster!
And... One, two, one, two,
one, two, one, two.
Get your knees up!
- Come on, you hotshots!
- She can't get away with this.
- I'm gonna get her.
- Let it go, Chris.
Like hell I will!
One, two, one, two...
- The period's not up.
- It is for me.
Keep running!
- There are ten minutes left.
- Stick 'em up your a...
You can't hit us!
You'll get canned for this, you bitch!
One more word from you
and I'm gonna knock you down!
She can't get away with this
if we all stick together. Norma?
Helen?
- Sue?!
- Shut up, Chris. Just shut up.
This isn't over.
This isn't over by a long shot!
You're out ofthe prom, Hargenson.
OK, the show's over.
In place, run! One, two, one, two!
"Telekinesis.
Thought to be the ability to move...
...or to cause changes in objects
by force ofthe mind."
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Coach said I'm in the nationals.
- Are you kidding? Hey, terrific!
- What's up?
- Can I talk to you?
- Right now?
- It's real important.
- All right.
- Tommy, if I asked you to do something...
- Yeah...
...very special for me, would you do it?
Yeah.
I want you to take
Carrie White to the prom.
How's it look in there?
Freddy!
Wanna go over to Minsky's
for some hard stuff?
No. Some other time, huh?
- You pussy!
- Gimme one ofthem beers!
- Suck on this, huh?
- All right!
- Yee-hoo!
- Hey, man!
- Oh, shit.
- Watch it, you stupid shit!
- Don't call me that, huh?
- Well, look what you did!
Stupid shit.
- I told you not to call me that.
- Look out!
Dumb punk!
- What, are you scared?
- You wanna get us killed?
Dumb shit.
You fuck!
OK, I'll do it.
Don't be in such a hurry.
Come on...
"Don't be in such a hurry."
- I'm hurryin' away from you.
- No, you're not.
- Pain right in the ass.
- You don't mean that.
I don't mean that
You're crazier than a son of a bitch,
you know that?
Come here.
Oh, shit.
Jesus, what's wrong with you?
- Can't you wait a minute?
- Well, whatfor? We do this all the time.
You're so ignorant.
Yeah, but that's what you
like about me, right? I know that.
Bullshit.
No? No?
I know what you like about me.
This. Don't you?
No!
Dirty shit!
I told you never to call me that!
You are totally fucked up!
You really are, I know that. I'm convinced.
Billy...
Come here.
Billy... Come on.
Come on.
I want you to do something.
- What?
- Something important.
Mm-hm?
Billy...
Oh, Billy...
Oh, Billy...
Billy...
Oh, Billy...
Oh, Billy... Billy... Oh, Billy...
Oh, Billy, I hate Carrie White.
Who?
Hi, Carrie.
Hi.
- How are you?
- OK.
Good. Uh...
What are you doin'?
Reading.
Yeah? What are you reading?
It's about, uh... sewing.
Sewing. That's good.
Um...
If you don't have a date for the prom next
Friday, would you like to go with me?
- What?
- To the prom.
It's next Friday.
I know this is late notice, but they...
Carrie? Carrie, let...
You guys go on. Practise those drills
from yesterday. I'll be right there.
Carrie?
Carrie.
Hey, Carrie, what's the matter?
- What happened?
- Nothin'.
Was it one ofthe girls?
- Did one ofthe girls do somethin' to you?
- No.
Well, what is it, then?
You can trust me. You know that?
- Would you tell me?
- I got invited to the prom.
That's great! That's fantastic!
So what are you mopin' around for?
- Tommy Ross asked me.
- That's even better.
- He's really cute, huh?
- I know who he goes around with.
They're just tryin'
to trick me again, I know.
Maybe not.
I mean... maybe he really meant it.
Let's think about this, now.
It might be terrific.
You might have a really good time.
Carrie?
Hey, Carrie, I wanna talk to you. It's about
this attitude you have about yourself.
You're always walkin' around
with your hair down, all mopin' around...
Carrie?
Come here, you big silly.
I want you to look at yourself.
Would you look at that?
Come on.
Now, that's a pretty girl.
Look at your eyes!
Little mascara to bring it out?
Your lips... Try some lipstick. You have
nice pretty lips. And your cheekbones.
Look at your hair. It's beautiful hair. You
could just put it up a little, add a little curl.
What do you think?
Yeah!
Well?
- Well, what do you wanna know?
- Why Tommy asked her to the prom.
- Well?
- I asked him to.
Why?
Whatfor?
What could you have had in mind?
I thought it would be good for Carrie to
get her to join in and be with people...
- Make her a part ofthings?
- Right.
Come on, Sue. We're not that stupid.
- Neither is Carrie.
- Maybe not. I don't know.
You mean you're not gonna go?
Stay in and miss your own senior prom?
Come in.
- What is it?
- The attendance sheets, Miss Collins.
You know you can't go without a date.
- Is there anything else, Norma?
- No, Miss Collins.
- Which brings us to you.
- I have to get to practice.
Well, it's too bad, isn't it?
- If you don't mind, it's between Sue and I.
- But I do mind.
Unless, of course, you'd like to continue
this little discussion in Mr Morton's office.
What is the big deal?!
Because it is a very big deal
for Carrie White, and you know it.
- She already said no anyway.
- With a little effort you can change that.
- Don't count your chickens.
- Just don't try.
- Fine. I won't try.
- Wait a second! It's notfine!
You can't order him
not to take someone to the prom!
I  make sure you don't hurt
Carrie White any more.
We're not trying to hurt her.
We're trying to help her!
How?
Hey, Tommy, um... Don't you think
you'll look a little ridiculous...
...when you walk in with Carrie White?
- We don't care how we look.
Do we?
What?
I...
- Hi, Carrie.
- Hi.
- So this is where you live, huh?
- What are you doing here?
You gonna ask me in?
- Why not?
-
Mama's resting.
- What do you want?
- God, right to the point, huh? Um...
- About the prom.
- I told you.
- But you can change your mind.
- Why are you doing this?
- Cos I want to.
- No, you're not.
- I don't do anything I don't want to.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!
-  Carrie!
- You better go.
- Not till you say yes.
- No. I can't.
- Yes, you can.
- I said I can't.
- Carrie!
Yes, you can.
- Will you please go?
- Not till you say yes.
Why is it so important to you?
I don't know.
Maybe because, um... you liked my poem.
Carrie!
- OK, OK, I'll go.
- Good. I'll pick you up at 8 o'clock.
OK.
What's the matter, Willie? We gonna
wake up the little piggies? Oink, oink!
You know, this is a hell of a risk for a joke.
- You want out?
- No, no. It's a good joke.
- You bet it's a good joke.
- Look at this!
- What?
- All these pigs!
- What are you talkin' about?
- These painted pigs!
Stupid Old Man Henty's nitwit cousin
painted 'em all over the place.
I went out with the girl that posed for 'em.
She was a real pig!
- Will you shut up?!
- Will you let me up here?
- I'm gonna kill that pig, right?
-
Piggy! Here, piggy!
I'm gonna bash your little heads in...
...and you don't have to worry
about the bomb no more.
Come here, little piggies! Come here,
you little sucker! Here's one right here.
- Will you shut up and do it?
- We gotta give 'em a chance.
- Oh, yeah?
- Come here, piggy!
You can't do itfrom standin' out here.
Get her done, man, get her done.
- I can't. I can't. You.
- Oh, I knew this would happen!
- Hold it there, you pig. You fuck-up!
- Do it, Billy!
- And you shut up!
- Just do it!
All right, move it out, move it out!
That's it! Come on! Move it out!
Yeah, that's my baby! Yeah!
Do it! Do it! Do it!
Carrie, you haven't touched
your apple cake.
Gives me pimples, Mama.
Pimples are the Lord's way
of chastising you.
- Mama?
- Yeah?
Mama, please see that I've gotta
try and get along with people.
What are you going on about, Carrie?
I've been invited to the prom.
- Prom?
-
- The senior prom. Everybody's goin'.
- It's that teacher that called, wasn't it?
Please see that I'm not
like you, Mama. I'm funny.
All the kids think I'm funny
and I wanna be normal.
I wanna start to try and be a whole person
before it's too late for me to...
- Tommy Ross is a very nice boy, Mama.
- No.
- He promised to stop in and meet you.
- I said no!
- Mama, I've accepted! I've accepted!
- I said no. No, no, no!
-  Come to your closet.
- No.
- After all you've been taught!
-  isn't bad!
-  isn't a sin!
- Come to your closet and pray.
Ask to be forgiven.
He's a nice boy, Mama. You'd like him.
You'd really like him, Mama.
Boys.
The boys! The boys! Yes, the boys.
After the blood come the boys -
like sniffin' dogs...
...grinnin' and slobberin' and tryin'
to find out where that smell comes from.
I know where they take them
cos I've seen it all!
- Well, you're not goin'.
- I already said I would.
Tell that boy you're not goin',
or we're gonna move from here!
No.
We'll move and you'll never see
him again! The rain's comin' in.
- Mama, please sit and talk to me.
- I'm gonna close the window.
Please sit and talk to me!
I'm going, Mama.
And things are gonna
change around here.
Witch. You've... got Satan's power.
It's nothin' to do with Satan, Mama.
It's me. Me!
If I concentrate hard enough,
I can move things.
- Satan is clever.
- No, Mama. I'm not the only one.
Other people can do it. I read about it.
You poor child. He doesn't let
you know he's workin' through you.
Mama... I'd know.
He entered your father
and carried him off!
- He ran away, Mama.
- The devil tempted him!
He ran away with a woman, Mama.
Everybody knows that.
You must renounce this power.
You must give it up. Never use it.
I'm goin', Mama.
You can't stop me.
And I don't wanna talk about it any more.
- Keep that damn light straight.
- Hurry up!
Watch it, you stupid shit!
You're getting blood all over the place!
Who you callin' a stupid shit? You can't
even keep thatfuckin' light straight.
Just hurry up.
Yes, ma'am! We's doin' the bes' we can!
We really are, boss!
Hurry up. I wanna go home.
Just keep your tits on...
...and I'll let you pull the rope
when the time comes.
- I plan to.
- I know.
Ernest! Tonight's prom night
and everything, right?
- I didn't know you were interested.
- I'm a student here, amn't I?
- I don't know. Are you?
- Sure I am.
I wanna be on the committee.
You're a little late.
I could have used you a week ago.
No, I'm not late. I'm right on time.
I wanna collect the ballots.
- For the king and queen and the voting.
- Uh...
- Think we can arrange that?
- OK. Can you be here... 6.30?
No. No, I can't be here at 6.30.
I'll be here at eight. How's eight?
Fine with me.
- Yeah, that'll do.
- See you then.
- Take it easy.
- I'll take it any way I can get it, pal.
Hey, Helen.
Helen! Helen!
- What?
- Did you hear about Tommy Ross?
- What?
- Did you hear about Tommy Ross?
- What?
- He's taking Carrie White to the prom.
- No!
- Yeah!
- He can't do that! Where's Sue?
- Yes, he can. He asked her.
- What's she gonna wear?
- Who, Carrie?
A sackcloth?
- Keep those stars comin' faster.
- They're coming.
What's this about Tommy
taking Carrie to the prom?
Whatever you heard, it's true.
Why's he doing it?
Everybody is talking about it.
I asked him to
cos I thought I owed it to Carrie.
- Where's that put everybody else?
- They gotta deal with it.
- What do you mean?
- Oh... just something.
- Well, you're not goin' to the prom.
- Oh, I'll be here.
You'll be here? You're goin' to the prom?
Shut up. I will tell you later.
You're gonna be in on it.
I'm gonna be in on it? What?
I'll tell you later!
- I want to know now, Chris.
- Just wait.
Can't you give me a hint? I won't tell
anybody, I promise. I'm your bestfriend.
- Come on.
- OK.
- You gotta rent a tuxedo for the prom.
- I only got ten bucks, though.
Ten bucks, you can rent one!
You don't have to look great.
- Does this look nice?
- He looks beautiful.
Make a good impression for once.
- Would you go out with me?
- Not with ruffles.
You don't have to get them for yourself.
You always gotta joke.
- I just don't like ruffles.
- You don't have to get ruffles!
Don't I look sharp?
It looks good on
but I don't look right in a tuxedo.
- Have you ever put on a tuxedo?
- I don't have a tuxedo body.
- I know they have tuxedos here for you.
- I wouldn't look right.
I know just the tuxedo for him.
Well, what do you think?
- I like it. I think it's terrific.
- Look at that. No ruffles at all!
Red. I might've known it would be red.
It's pink, Mama.
What Tommy gave me, Mama.
Aren't they beautiful?
I can see your dirty pillows.
Everyone will.
Breasts, Mama. They're called breasts.
And every woman has them.
Take offthat dress.
- No.
- We'll burn it and pray for forgiveness.
- No, Mama.
-
- Well, he's not comin'.
- He is coming, Mama. Now stop it.
I'm nervous enough.
No, he's not coming.
He's not gonna come.
Go away!
Stop it, Mama!
- Stop hurting yourself, Mama!
- I'm not.
He's gonna laugh at you!
They're all gonna laugh at you!
- No, they're not.
- It's not too late. Stay here with me.
I don't wanna stay with you, Mama!
I'll tell him you're sick!
- I'll tell him you changed your mind!
- Be quiet.
Sit down! Be quiet!
- I'll tell him that you changed your mind.
- Sit down!
Just sit there, Mama,
and don't say a word until I'm gone.
I'll be home early.
I love you, Mama.
"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."
Tommy...
Could we wait here just a minute?
- Are you scared?
- Mm-hm.
- Maybe this was a mistake.
- Oh, no. It's not gonna be  bad.
They're a good crowd. Really.
Really.
Don't be so nervous.
Besides, I'd look awfully stupid
dancing by myself, wouldn't I?
Now come on.

" Gettin' too drunk to talk
and we could barely walk
" Swearin' for the hell of it
" Then we'd hitch a ride
to see the president's daughter
" Her parties were so outta sight- Right
" Dancin' till dawn while her parents
were clean outta town
" High school, preschool
" Now twelve long years
ofthe education blues
" Teachers, preachers
" Now I don't know how
I ever made it through
Ross, if I knew you'd look this sharp, I'd
have taken you instead of whatshername.
Don't bother about them.
lfthey self-destruct, I'll dance with you.
Where did you buy that dress? I love it!
- Oh, I made it.
- Made it?!
- The decorations... don't they look great?
- Yeah.
- I'm so nervous.
- It's OK. You can sit with us.
- Hey, what time is it?
- 8 o'clock.
- Where are you going?
- Just out.
- See you later.
- Sue...!
- Would you like to dance?
- Could we just sit here for a minute?
Oh, sure. Sure, anything you want.
Carrie.
Hi, Miss Collins.
- You look so pretty!
- You too. You look beautiful.
Thank you! I know I don't, not really,
but thank you anyway.
- May I sit down?
- Grab a chair.
I'm gonna go and talk to some people.
I remember my prom.
I had a date with the captain
ofthe basketball team.
And he was six feet seven inches tall, so...
...I bought a pair ofthree-inch heels so our
kiss goodnight would be less awkward.
So anyway, we went
in his pick-up truck...
...which of course broke down, and we
had to walk the last half mile to the prom.
By the time I got there, my feet were so
blistered that all I could do was sit there.
I couldn't dance.
So we just sat there and, uh... just talked.
And... it was magic. Is it like thatfor you?
It's, um...
- It's nice.
- Just nice?
No. It's...
It's like, uh...
- It's like bein' on Mars.
- You'll never forget it.
I don't think I will.
Thank you.
Hey, what's goin' on here?
What are you doing with my date?
- Well, we were just talking.
- Yeah?
Have a lovely time, OK?
And you too!
Bye.
Don't let me catch you
huggin' any guys like that.
- I won't.
- Better not.
I won't.
Do you really have to be home so early?
Yeah, I promised.
OK.
- Sorry.
- That's all right.
Um...
Some ofthe kids are going
to Lewiston's after the prom.
- That's OK.
- What?
If you wanna go with your friends,
I don't wanna spoil anything.
Would you let me finish?
What I was gonna say...
...is that, if you'd like to, we could stop in
at the Beehive for a couple of minutes.
- I've never been there.
- No?
Good! Well, then, let's go!
- OK.
- OK? For sure.
Are you ready to dance?
- Come on.
- Tommy, I...
- Come on.
- I can't. I don't know how.
- I can't, Tommy. I can't.
- Sure you can.
" I'm not sure
" But the more that it's real
" The more it's right
" What a night
" It's as though we've been lovers
" All of our lives
" There must be a God
" Could it be that he's heard me at last?
" Because you look at me
- " As though I'm beautiful
- I can't.
You can. Come on.
Gimme your hand. Put it there.
- Like that?
- Yeah. Put this on my shoulder.
- Like that?
- That's right. OK, just relax.
All right?
OK. Just... listen to the music.
That's right.
See, you got it. That's good.
You're as good as anyone else out here.
You got it.
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
- It's just...
- That's all right.
No harm. No foul.
- I can't do anything.
- Yeah, you can.
I can't dance. I can't even... I don't know.
- Tommy?
- Yeah?
Why...
- Why what?
- Why am I here?
Because it's the prom.
Why am I here with you?
Because... I asked you.
- Why'd you ask me?
- Cos I wanted to.
Why'd you want to?
Because you liked my poem.
Only I didn't write it. Somebody else did.
Oh.
Carrie, we're here...
...and we're together...
...and  like it...
- I do, I like it!
- " Where there are other girls
" But tonight there's only me
" I never dreamed someone like you
" Could love someone like me
All right, ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen...
And you two behave yourselves, OK?
Take your seats, please.
We've gotta vote for the king and queen.
Tommy... we're on here.
I know.
You wanna decline?
Do you?
Hell, no. If you win, all they do is put you
up there for a school song and a dance.
Then they take your picture so everyone
can see we look like a couple of idiots.
- Anyway, it's the last year. Why not?
- It was so beautiful!
Hey.
beautiful.
Well, who should we vote for?
They're more your crowd than mine.
I don't even have a crowd.
Let's vote for ourselves.
- No.
- Why not?
Please don't vote for ourselves.
Carrie...
Come on. To the devil with false modesty.
The devil!
Billy! Shut up!
Will you close that a little bit?
Jesus, you wanna get caught?
- That Carrie White, she sure is cute.
- Shut up.
- Thought you said they were gonna win.
- They will. Won't even be close.
I called in a few favours.
Can I have your ballot, please?
Hello, guys. Thank you.
Ballots. Can I have your ballot, please?
- Thank you.
- Thanks there.
Freddy, hurry up, please.
Good, good. Thanks a lot there, Vic.
Get all of'em?
They're right in back of you,
so start kickin'.
Good luck.
More ballots? Thank you.
I have some more ballots for you guys.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've got the winners.
All right!
I give you Tommy Ross and Carrie White!

Somebody open this door!
Help! Help!
Can't these students calm down?
Mr Fromm! Mr Fromm!
Carrie!
Carrie...!
Mama?
Mama?
Mama? Mama, it was bad, Mama.
They laughed at me.
Mama, hold me.
Hold me, Mama. Please, hold me!
I should have killed myself
when he put it in me.
After the first time, before we were
married, Ralph promised never again.
He promised. And I believed him.
But sin never dies.
Sin never dies.
Atfirst it was all right. We lived sinlessly.
We slept in the same bed,
but we never did it.
And then, that night...
I saw him looking down at me that way.
We got down on our knees
to pray for strength.
I smelt the whisky on his breath.
And he took me... He took me...
...with the stink ofthe filthy
roadhouse whisky on his breath.
And I liked it. I liked it!
With all that dirty touchin'
of his hands all over me...
...I should have given you to God
when you were born.
But I was weak and backsliding.
And now the devil has come home.
- We'll pray.
- Yes.
We'll pray.
We'll pray. We'll pray.
For the last time,
we'll pray.
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...
...thy kingdom come, thy will be done...
Hello?
Oh, Betty, thank God it's you.
I don't think I could've handled
one more reporter.
Yeah, well... We're all a little edgy.
She's better. Well...
sleeping too much, I guess...
...but Dr Schneider said that's to be
expected after all she's been through.
Well, he said that she's young enough
so that she'll forget all about it in time.
It's all right!
It's all right. I'm here. It's all right.
It's all right. I'm here.
