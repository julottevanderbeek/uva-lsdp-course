MAN:
More blood.
Great. Keep it coming.
Chuck, Terry, pump away.
Don't be stingy.
Okay, watch that arm.
I can see that fake arm.
Chase, keep that claw really moving.
Jeffrey, jam it on there just like
Freddy would. Good. Good.
And cut. Print that, Gretchen.
WOMAN:
Thank you, sir. Printing seven only.
You're a genius. This makes his old claw
look like Mother Teresa's mitten.
You better thank them,
they're very sensitive.
-Chuck, Terry, great blood.
-Thank you very much.
Some of our best work.
Monkey man,
wanna see some neat stuff?
-Yeah!
-Chase.
Oh, come on.
It's only make-believe.
-Marianne, I gotta go.
-Okay.
Low bridge.
We'll see if we can't find someone's
to scare the pj's off of Mommy.
MAN:
Hey, Heather.
You hungry, Dylan?
Ooh, gotcha.
It should have flexed more.
Chase, I think the servos
got shorted out with blood.
Well, take it apart, pull it out,
and insulate them with some styro.
Thing wasn't meant to be submerged,
for Pete's sake.
I don't like that thing.
It puts bread on our table.
DYLAN:
Is it alive, Daddy?
WOMAN:
Heather, you're in the next shot.
State-of-the-art animatronics
enhanced with bio-organic grafting.
Bull tendons.
-Nerve bundles from a live Doberman.
-Chase.
Whoa.
Shit, Chuck!
Uh, it must have picked up a signal
from an AD's walkie-talkie.
TERRY: You sure it's turned off?
-It's off.
It's funny, it's warm,
just like a real hand.
Oh, God.
What the hell is going on?
Cut the effects!
HEATHER:
Chase!
CHASE:
Terry, where is it?
Terry!
Chuck, get off me!
Heather!
-Heather, where is it?
TERRY: Chase, where the hell is it?
Dylan!
CHASE:
Come on!
What the fuck?
Dylan.
Chase! No!
CHASE:
Earthquake. Come on.
DYLAN:
Mommy!
HEATHER:
Dylan!
Dylan! Dylan!
Dylan!
What is that?
Car alarms.
-You okay?
-Yeah.
You okay, chief?
-No.
CHASE: Heh, heh.
-Honey, do you have a fever?
-Just another earthquake, Dylan.
-Getting kind of fun, huh?
-Daddy, blood.
CHASE:
It's nothing, guys.
It's a scratch. Really.
Where did you get that?
I don't know. Picture, I guess.
The one that fell.
It's no big deal.
Put a bandage on it.
Don't worry about it.
Whoo!
REPORTER :
Geologists at Caltech have confirmed...
-...that this morning's aftershock....
-Do we have to watch that?
CHASE: You turned it on.
-lt caused further collapse...
...of the already badly damaged
parking structure....
I'll turn it off.
This is normal, following a quake
of last week's magnitude...
...now thought to be a massive 6.8.
HEATHER: Dylan, this is breakfast,
not arts and crafts.
CHASE:
Grr.
What?
Did you get any sleep last night?
More or less.
Okay, time to get dressed. I'm late.
You're going away?
Just for a few hours.
Julie will be with you.
Is there anything other than the obvious
bothering you?
I think five earthquakes in three weeks
is enough, sweetie.
Hasn't been another phone call,
has there?
No.
Good sign. Two full weeks without him.
Maybe he got hit by a truck.
He's closer, if anything.
It's giving me nightmares, Chase.
Did you have one last night?
Ah, it's just the earthquakes, Heather.
Maybe.
Maybe I shouldn't do
this interview today.
No. You've gotta get back
on the horse sometime.
Look, you had a nutcase
making harassing phone calls.
-I know how scary that's been.
-No, you don't.
Okay. I don't.
But it doesn't mean
that it can't be over.
Yeah, but what if it isn't over?
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
Oh, it was nothing. It was....
You and I were working on this movie,
together for once...
...and one of your special effects
went really wrong.
And Chuck and Terry got hurt...
...and, heh, well, your fingers were cut.
Right here?
Ooh!
Heather, you were probably half-awake...
...and saw my fingers get nicked
when the mirror fell. Dreams are like that.
Look, if you don't want me
to go on this job, I won't.
Pfft! Just be careful, okay?
I think l can survive two days
in Palm Springs...
...supplying soap bubbles
for a detergent commercial, don't you?
I guess so.
-You guess so?
-Yeah.
Come here.
Mmm. Forty eight hours.
I'll be back in no time.
-I gotta go.
-Okay.
CHASE:
Hey!
I love what you've done with the place.
Knock them dead.
Dylan, I gotta go! Take care of Mommy.
DYLAN:
Bye.
TINA :
Nancy.
Dylan.
Nancy.
Dylan, I don't want you watching this.
What? What's wrong?
What's gotten into you?
Hello?
MAN :
One, two--
-Hello?
MAN: Freddy's coming for you!
Chase!
Someone's coming.
What?
-Are you okay, honey?
-Yes.
JULIE:
Heather!
Hey.
Is everything okay?
Yeah. Just these quakes.
Did you feel a little one just now?
Oh, no. A truck went by
right before you opened the door.
That's life on the fault line.
-Hey, tiger.
-Hi, Julie.
Oh!
Does he feel warm to you?
He had a fever this morning, I think.
Hmm. No. He seems okay.
Are you sure that's all that's wrong?
You seem--
Leave us alone, you son of a bitch!
DRIVER:
L.A. Limousine, ma'am.
Just wanted you to know l'm out front.
I'm sorry! Can you hang on a minute?
Heather.
-What is it?
-I don't know.
I just have this weird feeling today.
Mommy...
-...stay home, then.
-Dylan.
This damn caller.
He started again?
Sick fuck.
Sorry.
You know, Dylan doesn't
seem to have a fever.
It's probably just your nerves.
Nerves?
I just meant from the shaker
this morning.
I mean, everybody's freaked out
about how many we've been having.
And then these phone calls.
Don't answer it.
-Hello?
DRIVER: Excuse me, ma'am...
-...but we are going to be late.
-Okay.
Dylan?
I gotta go. Forgive me?
Bye.
I'll, uh, call the cops for you.
You've got the number on the fridge, right?
Just give them the time they called
and they're keeping this list, supposedly.
Oh, Julie.
I'm really sorry.
My nerves are a little raw.
It's okay.
Yeah. I gotta go.
-Morning.
-Good morning.
You play that girl?
In that movie.
With the guy with the pfft!
Yeah, sure. That's you.
Ah, that's what I love about this job.
I get to meet the stars.
I'm hardly a star.
What? Are you kidding?
I love your stuff.
The first was the best.
Your girlfriend's cut open
and dragged across the ceiling.
It was awesome.
When that blood comes out
of your boyfriend's bed?
Yeah, I thought I'd shit.
But they never should have
killed off Freddy!
Heather, look, we gotta go! Let's go!
Come on. Cutting it close, aren't you?
Trying to get me fired?
Okay, okay, okay! We're coming!
We're coming. No! No! No!
So, Heather, we're approaching
the 1 0th anniversary...
...of this Nightmare on Elm Street thing.
I mean the original five
very popular sequels.
How has all this success
affected you personally?
Well, I don't know if it really has, Sam.
Oh, God.
With the exception of 1 and 3,
I pretty much stayed out of it.
You know, I'm doing a lot
more television now.
Those hours let me spend more time
with my husband and my little boy.
That's right, you have a little boy.
What's his name?
Dylan.
With Dylan, does that change your feeling,
your perspective about horror movies?
No, not really.
Would you let him see
one of your movies?
My son? Heh, no.
I'm sure people always ask you this
all the time.
Is there going to be another sequel?
And what's more, is Freddy really dead?
Of course he is. Freddy's dead and gone.
How about your co-star in the original,
in Nightmare 1 ?
Would you trust him alone with Dylan?
Robert? Heh. I don't know.
Why don't we ask him
how he'd feel about it?
We've got a big surprise for you,
Heather. And for our audience.
Let's bring him out,
he is the best of the bad.
Let's say hello to Robert Englund!
ROBERT:
Ha, ha!
Love you, babe!
We'll do lunch! Ha!
All right! Yeah!
Freddy's back!
Give it up for your Uncle Freddy!
Just when you thought it was safe
to get back into bed!
Give me five!
I'm back and I'm badder than ever!
AUDIENCE :
Freddy! Freddy! Freddy!
ROBERT:
Ha! You are all my children now!
-We've gotta go, Robert.
-Um, just a second. I'll walk you.
-There you go, Christy.
GIRL: Thank you!
ROBERT: Bye-bye!
GIRL: Thank you!
-You okay?
-I'm fine.
I don't know.
Everything went great, I thought.
-We really got you, didn't we?
-I don't know why you didn't tell me.
Come on, they loved
the expression on your face.
-They'd like to see us together again.
-In what, a romantic comedy?
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean
you can't have a decapitation or two.
-Heather, there's a call for you.
-For me?
-Listen, I'll talk to you later. Bye-bye.
-Bye-Bye.
Hello?
WOMAN: Heather, it's Sara Risher
over at New Line Cinema.
How are you?
Hi, Sara. How are you?
This is a voice from the past.
lt sure is. Well, listen, Heather,
l won't take but a minute.
lt's just that we have something
to propose to you...
...and I wonder if you'd stop by the offices.
Bob would love to talk to you.
Well, sure. When?
No time like the present.
The car will bring you over.
-Now?
-Just take a minute.
You'll be glad you did, I bet. Bye.
-Can I help you?
-I'm here to see Bob Shaye.
Was Bob expecting you?
-Heather? Hi.
-Sara, how are you?
-I'm fine. How are you?
-Great to see you.
-You look great.
-Thank you.
Bob is dying to see you.
-Can I get you something to drink?
-Coffee would be fine.
-Black?
-Black's fine.
Kim, could you get us some coffee?
-Sure.
-Thanks.
SHAYE:
I think the guy's a little bit of a jerk...
...but we won't know
until we've read the script.
Anyhow, l'll give you a call when l--
Hey! Listen, man, l gotta go.
-Thanks.
SHAYE: Call me when you get to Milan.
And don't forget, risotto con tartufo.
It's fantastico.
Take care, man. I'll talk to you later. Bye.
Boy, do you look great, Heather.
How are you?
Great. I'm fine.
I don't have to ask how you're doing.
Well, so far, so good.
Which, by the way,
is why we asked you to come by today.
-Ah, thanks, Kim.
-Sure.
Look, Heather,
let me cut to the chase.
How would you like to join us
in the definitive Nightmare?
I thought you killed Freddy off.
Well, we did, but the fans--
You know, the fans, God bless them,
they're clamoring for more.
I guess evil never dies, right?
Anyhow, a few weeks ago
I got a call from Wes...
...and he pitched me
this really exciting idea.
I started thinking, "Who better
to resurrect Freddy than his creator?"
Well, I thought Wes stopped doing
horror movies.
Do you know he actually told me
he hadn't called in the last 1 0 years...
...because he hadn't had any
really scary nightmares.
They're his inspiration for this thing.
Anyhow, he's right
in the middle of the script.
Which means he's having
nightmares again.
Well, he's very excited about it.
-The nightmares?
-No, sweetie, the script.
And you should be too,
because you're the star.
I don't know, Bob.
I'm flattered, really.
-But I have a kid now and--
-Well, so?
So I'm not sure about doing horror.
Oh, come on, Heather. Kids love horror.
Thank you so much, Bob.
I have other things happening.
I promise you we'll match any offer
that's on the table.
No. It's not that.
Look, I have a fan.
You've got plenty of fans. We've been
doing marketing research on you.
You are rating right up there.
We've got Chase working on
a prototype for the new glove.
-It's really--
-What?
Okay, I know, we asked him
to keep it as a surprise...
...until you and I could
have this conversation.
Bob...
...how long has Wes
been working on this script?
I don't know. A couple months. Why?
Since you've been thinking of making it,
has anything funny happened?
-What do you mean?
-Well, like weird phone calls?
Or nightmares?
Why don't you answer your phone, Bob?
Come on. That's what we've got
people we pay around here for.
Will someone pick up the damn phone?
-Thanks a lot.
DRIVER: You're welcome.
Dylan?
Never sleep again.
Never sleep again.
What is going on?
You didn't let him watch
the movie on TV, did you?
Movie? He didn't watch anything on TV.
He was taking his nap,
and I heard him screaming.
Honey, are you okay?
Mm-hm. Rex saved me.
He did?
Is Rex going to die?
No!
Rex is not going to die.
I promise you, sweetie.
Do you know where the sewing stuff is
in the kitchen?
Sure.
We'll do an operation, okay? Come on.
Dr. Dylan and Dr. Julie.
Fix him up good as new, okay? Okay.
MAN: Hey, Chase, you got a call!
It's your wife.
-Heather.
-Chase, hi. You better come home.
Oh, Heather, I'm stuck here.
Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.
Why? What's the matter?
-Chase, it's Dylan.
-What?
Hold on. The phone's breaking up.
Okay. What's going on with Dylan?
He's had some sort of an episode.
What? What kind of episode?
He was just acting very strangely...
...like somebody was after him.
It's scary. It scared me.
-He was acting like....
-Like what?
Like Freddy.
Heather, has there been
another phone call?
Chase, why didn't you tell me
you were working on a new glove?
And why aren't Chuck and Terry
at work today?
Forget those clowns, Heather.
Answer me.
Has there been another
phone call today or not?
Yes.
Okay.
I'm coming home.
I'll be there in three hours.
Danny, I gotta go.
-What's up, Chase?
-My kid's sick. l gotta fly.
HEATHER:
"As soon as the sun was up...
...the witch made Gretel
fetch wood and kindle a fire.
'We will bake cookies first,' she said.
'I've heated the oven
and kneaded the dough.
Crawl in and see if the fire
is blazing high enough now.'
As she pushed Gretel
toward the oven...
...the witch meant to shut the door
and bake her once she was inside."
Dylan, this is so violent.
I don't know why you like
these stupid old fairy tales.
Finish, please.
They're gonna give you nightmares.
I like this story.
"But Gretel guessed
what the witch was planning.
'I don't know how to get in,' Gretel said.
'How am I to manage it?'
'Stupid girl,' shouted the witch
rushing up to the oven.
'The opening is big enough.
See, I can fit myself.'
Then quickly, Gretel came behind
and pushed with all her might...
...plunging the wicked old woman
headlong into the flames...
...banging the door shut
and bolting it tight.
The witch howled."
That's enough.
"The witch howled like a scalded cat...
...but Gretel ran and left her there
to perish nonetheless.
She ran to her brother as fast as she could
and flung open the door.
'Hansel! Hansel!' she cried,
'We're saved! The witch is dead!"'
Time for sleep.
Say how they find their way back home.
Tomorrow night.
No. Tonight.
It's important.
Dylan, you know as well as I do.
They follow the trail of bread crumbs
back to their house.
And then their father covered them
with kisses and they were safe.
They were safe and they could sleep.
Now, come on.
-What is that?
-Rex.
Come on.
Rex keeps him down there.
Who?
The mean old man with the claws.
He wants to come up
while we sleep.
I keep my feet up here.
Rex keeps him down there.
He's my guard.
You should have a guard too.
Dylan, there's nothing down there.
Come here.
Look. See?
It's different when you're gone.
Come on.
On, please.
Okay, sweetie.
Night, night. Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Daddy coming home?
He's on his way.
DYLAN:
He can follow the bread crumbs, right?
Right.
If the birds don't eat them first.
Ah, perfect, perfect, perfect.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Light
Losin' my
Religion
Mommy's scared?
Dylan.
Mommy's fine.
It was just a bad dream.
What are you doing out of bed?
Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
Dylan, go back to sleep, honey.
I'm not sleepy.
PATROLMAN:
Hello?
Police, ma'am. Can you open the door?
Heather Langenkamp?
Yes?
Is Chase Porter your husband?
Yes.
I'm afraid there was an accident.
It appears he fell asleep
while driving, ma'am.
Is he--? I mean--
Is he hurt?
I'm afraid it's worse than that, ma'am.
Is he dead?
Yes, ma'am.
Are you sure it's him?
We have his effects.
You can confirm from that.
I wanna see his body.
No, you don't, ma'am. lt's not necessary.
I want to see it for myself.
Ahem. Excuse me.
-Can I help you?
-Porter.
Chase Porter.
It's back here.
You said Chase?
Mm-hm.
I'm sorry.
Just sign here at the bottom.
That's all we need.
I'd like to see once again.
I'm sorry?
Could you lift the sheet again, please?
More, please?
What is that?
It was a bad wreck, ma'am.
The head's gonna be all right
for the funeral and all, but--
Here, lady. You okay?
-You sure?
-Yes.
Oh, God. What did that?
Well, they said the truck was tore up
something awful.
So you can imagine him not being in...
...well, exactly top shape.
It looks like...
...he was clawed.
Yeah.
Well, that's why
we don't lift the sheet...
...past the face, ma'am.
Sometimes it's what we don't see
that gets us through the night.
So, uh, if you'll just sign....
MINISTER:
God is our hope and strength...
...a very present help in trouble.
Therefore, we will not fear,
though the earth be moved...
...and though the hills be carried
into the midst of the sea...
...though the waters thereof
rage and swell...
...and though the mountains shake
at the tempest of the same--
Look!
Julie, where's Dylan?
I don't know.
Help! Mommy!
Dylan!
-Mommy!
HEATHER: Dylan!
Dylan! Grab Mommy's hand!
Grab it!
Oh, my God!
Hurry!
Stay with me.
Aah! No!
Stay with me, Heather.
No!
-Where's Dylan? Where's Dylan?
-He's all right. He's right here.
-Oh, what happened?
-It was an earthquake.
You got knocked off your feet.
You got a pretty good bump, actually.
MINISTER:
May he rest in peace, children...
...and may you all get home safely.
ALL:
Amen.
If there's anything I can do, Heather.
Anything.
Thank you, Robert.
Sweetie?
NANCY :
Tina?
Dylan.
Tina?
Who are you?
Dylan.
Baby, wake up.
Dylan! Dylan! Dylan, honey.
Shh, shh, shh.
Come on.
Okay, sugar.
We're gonna go back to bed now.
No, Mommy, I can't sleep there.
Honey, you have to sleep.
One, two, Freddy's coming for you
Where did you hear that?
Did you hear that on that movie?
Did you answer the phone?
Dylan, where did you hear that song?
In my bed.
In your bed?
Under my covers. Kids singing.
And way down there, the man...
...the mean man....
What is that man doing?
Trying to get up.
Trying to get up into our world.
Dylan.
Where is Daddy now?
Daddy's in heaven.
He's with God now.
Do you have to die to see God?
I don't think so.
I think you have to pray.
And reach out.
Why does God let there be bad things?
I honestly don't know, honey.
Please try to get some sleep.
Can you come with me in my dreams?
I think that only happens in the movies.
But I'll always, always,
be right here when you get back.
And I'll make sure...
...that nobody gets your toes.
HEATHER:
I know his behavior is bizarre.
But he's usually so normal
and well adjusted, John.
I just can't believe it's him
and not something outside influencing him.
Or is that how denial works?
Whether it is denial,
I don't think that's the case here.
Look, if you're really worried about Dylan,
have a doctor check him out.
You'll see. Everything's fine.
You're not just saying that
to help a crazy friend cope, are you?
Everything about Dylan's behavior
is understandable...
...for a kid who just lost his father.
How does a child process
a thing like that?
I don't know.
I've not been able to process it
very well myself.
And you're not crazy, by the way.
Seeing Freddy in that grave
feels pretty crazy, and then jumping in.
-You didn't jump in.
-That's my memory.
It seemed absolutely real.
Seemed, not was.
It's....
It's in my family, you know.
What is?
A very close relative
died in an institution.
Really? Well, if having a screwy family
made a person crazy...
...the whole world would be
one big loony bin.
You have a crazed fan after you.
That's what's making you crazy,
and probably Dylan too.
-I never mentioned that to him.
-Kids know.
Kids know when something's
bugging a parent.
You have no idea who this is calling?
Freddy, for all I know.
Come on.
It's a man...
...or a boy, with a deep, you know...
...Freddy voice.
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised
you've got Freddy in your dreams?
Hell, Sonny Bono...
...after a while began seeing
his stalker everywhere, even at Mass.
HEATHER:
Really?
JOHN: And how many times did Letterman
call the cops thinking that woman...
-...was down in the kitchen again?
-Yeah.
I mean, it gets under your skin if you....
If you let it.
You really think Dylan's okay?
Dylan's fine. You're fine.
You're hurting but you're fine,
and you're definitely not crazy.
My worst fear...
...that whatever madness
is in my family I have.
That I've passed it on to Dylan.
HEATHER:
Dylan!
-Heather!
HEATHER: Dylan!
-Make sure he's okay, John!
-Yeah, are you all right?
-Are you okay, huh?
HEATHER: Oh, my God.
-Are you sure? Does anything hurt?
-Dylan, are you all right? Honey?
Are you all right? Are you sure?
God wouldn't take me.
Oh, my God. Oh, honey.
JOHN:
It's unbelievable.
-Yeah.
-Robert.
-Heather, you doing all right?
-Hanging in there.
You know the guy that was
calling me all the time?
He started again.
And he's putting stuff in my mail again.
The SOB probably read about the funeral
in the papers or something.
Sick mother. It's the last thing
you need right now, I'm sure.
Actually, it's been giving me
Freddy nightmares.
Wait a second,
now let me get this straight.
You're having nightmares about Freddy?
As in me?
No, it isn't you. He's scarier.
He's....
Darker? More evil?
Yeah. How did you know?
Call it a guess.
Pretty damn good guess.
Anyway, what I was calling about was...
...have you seen any of the script
by any chance?
No. Wes won't show it until he's finished.
At least that's what he told me.
Well, when is it gonna be done?
Well, the way he's writing, who knows?
He's so weird.
I asked him how far he was
at the funeral. What did he say?
Oh, yeah. "As far as Dylan
trying to reach God."
Whatever that means. Weird, huh?
Putting your kid in the script.
Robert, have you been
having nightmares?
Look, we need to talk,
but not over the phone.
Can I come over?
Um, actually, Heather, uh...
...today's no good. There's, um....
There's something I have to finish.
Tomorrow maybe, huh?
Okay, tomorrow.
But early in the morning.
And meanwhile, Robert, take care, okay?
Yeah. Sure.
Damn it!
DYLAN :
One, two, Freddy's coming for you
Dylan?
DYLAN:
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, grab your crucifix
Seven, eight, better stay up late
Dylan. Don't sing that song.
Nine, 1 0, never sleep again
Dylan!
Stop it!
No!
DYLAN :
Never sleep again
Never sleep again
Dylan.
Never sleep again
Never sleep ag--
-Yes.
FREDDY: Ha-ha-ha. I touched him.
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
HEATHER:
No.
HEFFNER: Diabetes?
-No.
Was there a trigger event?
Trauma, shock?
You haven't shown him any of the films
you've made, have you?
The horror stuff?
His father just passed away.
HEFFNER:
I'm sorry.
But I'm convinced...
...those films can tip an unstable child
over the edge.
Unstable?
Dylan's not unstable. He's just upset.
HEFFNER: We'll run tests
and we'll know in a few days.
Does he have to stay here overnight?
Absolutely.
WOMAN :
Dr. Degraffey, ER.
Anything more happen
we need to know about?
Well, like what?
Sometimes what a child says
or fantasizes...
...will give a clue to what ails him.
Did he say anything
while he was still lucid?
No.
Dr. Einhorn, line 237.
What do we have here?
Too soon to know for sure.
The early symptoms point
to childhood schizophrenia.
Dylan, can you hear me?
Dylan, you have to fight it...
...whatever it is that's after you,
and you gotta come back to me.
You can't make it alone. Do you hear?
If you can hear me, then you can tell me
what you need to feel safe.
Rex? Is that what you want?
Well.... Well, Rex is at home...
...and that's where you should be.
But you gotta get better
before they'll let you come home.
Do you understand?
Home.
Home. Home, that's right.
That's where I want you, sweetie.
And you know, we're not that far away.
Look. Look, right out there...
...past the freeway is our home.
But to get there...
...you have to come out
from where you are...
...so that they'll let you
come home to Rex...
...and to me.
Time for your medicine, cowboy.
HEATHER:
What is that?
Something to help him sleep.
Okay.
There you go. Yeah, it's good.
There you go.
One, two, good.
Good! Attaboy!
Come on, now lie down
and take a little nap.
You should get some rest too.
He's going to be fine.
We're gonna do some tests
and then you can come back later.
Will you get that other side, please?
I grabbed his things.
These are his favorite pajamas here.
Um....
Honey, I've gotta go.
I love you, Dylan.
Remember what I said.
We'll take care of everything.
Bye.
MAN:
Wake up, lady!
Don't lose it now!
WOMAN :
Seismologists at Caltech have counted...
...over 300 of the tremblers so far.
Though most were too faint
for us to feel...
...seven have shaken our community
in the last two weeks.
And now scientists are speculating
there might be an unknown fault...
...running beneath Los Angeles.
A fault that could--
ROBERT :
Hi. You've reached the Englund residence.
We're out of town right now.
You can leave a message if you wish,
but, uh, we'll be gone for some time.
WES: I wish l could tell you where this
script was going. The fact is l don't know.
You know, I dream a scene at night.
I write it in the morning.
Beyond that, your guess is as good
as mine where it's going.
Well, at least tell me
what it's about so far.
-Coffee.
-Thanks.
I can tell you
what the nightmare's about so far.
It's about this entity,
whatever you want to call it.
It's old. It's very old.
It's existed in different forms
in different times.
The only thing that stays the same
is what it lives for.
What is that?
Well, the murder of innocence.
This is still a script
we're talking about, right, Wes?
Yeah, well, I sort of think of it
as a nightmare in progress.
Well, in this nightmare in progress then,
does this thing have any weaknesses?
Well, it can be captured sometimes.
Captured? How?
By storytellers, of all things.
I mean, every so often they imagine a story
good enough to sort of catch its essence...
...and then for a while
it's held prisoner in the story.
-Like the genie in the bottle.
-Exactly. Exactly.
But the problem comes
when the story dies.
That can happen in a lot of ways.
It can get too familiar to people...
...or somebody waters it down
to make it an easier sell.
You know, or maybe it's just so upsetting
to society that it's banned outright.
However it happens when the story dies,
the evil is set free.
You're saying
Freddy is this ancient thing?
Right. Current version.
And for 1 0 years,
he's been held captive pretty much...
...as Freddy in the
Nightmare on Elm Street series...
...but now that the films have ended...
...the genie's out of the bottle, Heather.
That's what the nightmares are telling me
and that's what I'm writing.
Well, if Freddy is loose in your script...
...where's he gonna go?
Another age? Another form?
No. That's not what the dreams
have him doing though.
What is he doing?
Well, see, he's sort of gotten
used to being Freddy now...
...and he likes our time and space,
so he's decided to cross over.
Out of films, into our reality.
Isn't there somebody
who can stop him?
Actually, there is a person
in the dreams...
...sort of a gatekeeper, so to speak.
Somebody that Freddy has to get by
before he can come through into our world.
That person's you, Heather.
-It's me?
-Yeah.
But why me?
Well, dramatically speaking,
it makes perfect sense.
You played Nancy, after all.
You were the first to humiliate him,
defeat him.
That was Nancy, Wes, it's not me.
Yeah, but it was you
that gave Nancy her strength...
...so in order to get out
he's got to come through you.
And it's inevitable that he's gonna try
to do that at your most vulnerable points.
Oh, my God, Wes. Did you know?
Heather, it was a script.
It was a dream. I didn't know.
You know damn well
it's more than that now.
Wes.
How can we stop him?
I think the only way to stop him
is to make another movie.
I swear I'll stay by this computer
and write until I finish the script...
...but when that time comes,
you're gonna have to make a choice.
Choice? What kind of choice?
Whether or not you're willing
to play Nancy one last time.
HEATHER: "Many of the symptoms
of childhood schizophrenia...
...are duplicated in children
suffering from sleep deprivation."
"Sleep deprivation can produce
trance-like states...
...mechanical behavior...."
DYLAN:
I'm not sleepy.
Rex woke me up.
He was fighting the mean old man
with the claws.
You have no idea who this is calling?
Freddy, for all I know.
As in me?
HEATHER:
No, it isn't you. He's scarier.
-Darker? More evil?
-How did you know?
WES:
He's decided to cross over...
...out of films, into our reality.
Never sleep again.
The world of horror films
suffered its own terror today...
...as two of Hollywood's best-known
special-effects technicians...
...were found dead in a vacant field.
Terrance Feinstein
and Charles Wilson...
...two special-effects artists reputedly
working on a top-secret project...
...for the makers of
the Freddy Krueger films...
...were found brutally slashed to death
early this morning.
Freddy's glove was missing, and police are
speculating the murders were the result...
...of a botched theft,
which apparently took place two days ago.
At this point the murder weapon
has not been found--
Oh, God.
Miss me?
Nancy.
Ow!
Oh, Dylan. Dylan!
NURSE: There are no visiting hours.
You must understand.
JULIE:
No, I don't understand. I'm his babysitter.
I'm a close friend of the family, damn it.
I just need to see him for a minute.
-Sixty seconds. Come on.
-You have to understand...
-...I can't let you see him.
-Julie?
-Heather.
-What are you doing here?
I don't know.
I had this terrible dream about Dylan.
I had to come and see him.
You must think I'm crazy.
No, I don't. Is he all right?
I don't know, they wouldn't let me in.
Miss Langenkamp, I'm afraid
there are no evening visiting hours...
-...in intensive care.
-Is he all right?
Dylan? He's holding well.
Earlier, he had some problems.
He's in an oxygen tent just now.
Oh, my God.
Heather.
Seems we've had an accident,
Miss Langenkamp.
May I?
Those are nasty cuts.
How did you get them?
It happened in the earthquake.
I fell.
I need to see Dylan.
Wait a moment.
First, let's see about you.
HEFFNER: lf these had been
a few inches nearer the wrist....
What did you say you cut yourself on?
It was the earthquake, it was dark,
I have no idea.
But these look quite fresh.
They are.
It happened in tonight's earthquake.
It happened just 1 5 minutes ago.
You must have felt it.
Guess we lucked out over here.
Your son is apparently
terrified of a man...
...someone he thinks is going
to come out of his bed.
One of the nurses heard him
talking to himself.
Do you have any idea
who that man is, Miss Langenkamp?
I forgot to bring his dinosaur, Rex.
He keeps Freddy
from coming up out of his...
...bed.
The man from your films?
Freddy Krueger? With the claws?
Is that who he's afraid of?
You have let your child
see your films, haven't you?
Every kid knows who Freddy is.
He's like Santa Claus or King Kong or....
Yes. Well...
...interesting talking with you,
Miss Langenkamp.
I hope you understand.
My concerns are simply
for the welfare of your son.
How's he doing?
Dylan!
Honey! You shouldn't do that.
Too late.
I'm almost there, Heather.
Almost there!
Daddy!
Dylan!
-Help!
DYLAN: Daddy!
Doctor!
Keep her right there!
NURSE:
We can't hold him much longer, doctor.
-Full anesthetic. Stat!
-We don't have that here, doctor.
No anesthetic, you say.
Screw it then, I'm going in.
Little booger's full of something
I don't like.
Let's get him open.
Cut this evil out of him.
Ha!
No!
-Gloria!
-He's got my baby?
-Who?
-Freddy!
Freddy? Who?
Freddy Krueger or something?
What the hell is going on?
My baby, Freddy's got my baby.
He's got my Dylan.
Miss Langenkamp. Miss Langenkamp.
I suggest you go home
and get some rest.
Your son is fine.
He's been taken downstairs
for further testing.
But he was just here.
He was here.
You fell asleep. We took him.
You looked so exhausted.
Frankly, we didn't want to wake you.
Besides, the young woman
Julie is with him.
That's his babysitter, right?
Believe me, everything is fine.
Everything's not fine.
Damn. Call security.
WOMAN :
Security, code yellow to Pediatric Testing.
Security, code yellow to Pediatric Testing.
Uh, this is a restricted area.
-Do you have a pass?
-Screw your pass!
HEFFNER:
It's all right. Miss Langenkamp.
-Where is he?
-Just stay calm.
Tell us how our little boy is doing.
He's fine, actually. Uh, he just came
around about 1 0 minutes ago.
Uh, he seems to be suffering
from acute sleep deprivation.
I don't think she lets him get sleep.
What are you saying? Where is he?
JULIE:
Heather.
I've got someone here
who wants to see you.
HEATHER:
Julie.
HEATHER:
Dylan!
Oh, honey. Oh, Dylan.
Are you okay, champ?
Can we go get Rex now?
The bad man's getting awful close.
I know he is.
We're gonna go get Rex right now.
I'm afraid Dylan should stay here...
...until we know what's causing
these episodes, Miss Langenkamp.
I'm sure you understand.
Good.
Look, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna go home
and get Rex for you right now.
You know that home
isn't far from here, right?
-Right across the freeway.
-That's right.
So I won't be gone long. And Julie,
she's gonna stay right here with you.
Yeah. You bet.
Hurry up, please. l'm sleepy.
I promise. Cross my heart.
But, Dylan, until Mommy gets back...
...whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Julie, don't let him out of your sight.
What's going on here?
Your hair's turning gray.
Julie, keep him awake!
Understand?
Excuse me, miss,
would you come with us for a second?
What? Hey!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Get your hands off me.
Do you mind? What the hell is this?
Just a quick word, Miss Langenkamp,
for Dylan's sake.
Well, we've had an exciting day,
haven't we, Miss Langenkamp?
-One, two, three. One, two, three.
-You won.
Would you mind stepping outside
for just one moment, miss?
As a matter of fact, I would.
What are you doing?
It's just a little shot
to see that he gets some sleep.
No. His mother specifically said--
-I said no.
-Do it.
DYLAN: Ow!
-All done.
He'll be asleep in no time.
-Would you mind letting go of my arm?
-You bitch!
Hey! You can't do that!
Well, I know what's in that one.
Do you have any idea what's in this one?
Or what's gonna happen to you
when I stick you with it?
And I will.
Aah!
Oh, no. No, no, no, Dylan.
I want you to stay awake, okay?
I want you to keep your eyes open for me,
okay? Come on.
Miss Langenkamp...
...has there been any use
of recreational drugs in your family?
-What?
-Or any history of mental disturbance?
-What are you asking?
-Please, don't take it wrong.
If there was, there's a good chance...
...Dylan could be suffering
from something passed down to him.
Have you been suffering from any
delusional events, Miss Langenkamp?
OFFICER:
Mm-mm.
HEFFNER:
This man from your films...
...Freddy Krueger....
Have you been seeing him?
No.
-Hello!
-Would you get those keys?
Dylan, I want you to stay awake.
Come on, stay awake.
-Keep your eyes open for me, okay?
-Where's Mommy?
She'll be back. Now, stay awake.
There are drugs and treatments,
Miss Langenkamp.
We could put Dylan in foster care
for a short while...
...just long enough
to run some tests on you.
Just keep your eyes open.
Do that for me, okay?
Come on. Stay awake.
Stay awake for me, Dylan.
I want you to stay awake, okay?
Stay awake. Keep your eyes open.
Dylan, what's the matter?
Julie, behind you.
There's nothing there.
Dylan, what's wrong?
Dylan, stop it. You're scaring me.
Dylan?
I want my son out of here, right now!
Very well.
As soon as we can gather
the appropriate papers.
You don't understand!
If Dylan falls asleep--
ATTENDANT:
I got it.
Oh, no!
Dylan, get out of here!
Get-- Dylan!
Hey, Dylan, ever play skin the cat?
JULIE:
Aah! No! No!
FREDDY:
Come on.
Help me.
Julie!
Rex!
OFFICER:
What the hell's going on?
No, miss, you can't go in there.
No, get back.
No, wait, wait. You can't--
WOMAN :
Code yellow to Pediatric Testing.
Code yellow to Pediatric Testing.
HEATHER:
Julie.
Where's my son? Where is he?
Have you seen my son?
-He was just here. He was just....
-The boy?
No way he's going anywhere.
He's been heavily sedated.
He doesn't have to be awake
to be on his feet.
-What?
-He sleepwalks, you idiot!
He's fully capable of walking
out of this hospital! Oh, shit!
JOHN : Hello?
-John, It's Heather. I need your help!
-Why? What happened?
-John, Dylan's run away from the hospital.
I don't know if he's wandering around
or headed for the house...
...but I think Freddy's after him!
I know that sounds so crazy, but--
You're right. That sounds crazy.
Oh, my God.
Dylan!
HEATHER:
You know that home isn't far from here.
No! Dylan!
DYLAN:
Right across the freeway.
Dylan!
Dylan!
Krueger, you bastard!
Take me!
Dylan!
-Are you okay?
-Hey, man, is she okay?
My son is out here!
Dylan! Dylan! Leave me alone! Dylan!
Dylan!
Dylan!
-Dylan? Aah!
-Oh, l'm sorry!
What happened to you?
Are you all right?
I'm fine. Have you seen Dylan?
Where is he?
Take it easy. Take it easy. Relax.
He's right there. What happened?
Oh, Dylan! Oh, God! You're here.
JOHN: What's going on, Heather?
What in the world happened?
-I know how Chase really died.
-What do you mean?
Fred Krueger did it.
Yeah, sure.
You saw him, didn't you?
Coming for you
JOHN:
Nancy, let's go outside.
-Dylan.
-He'll be all right.
I'll be right back.
What the hell is going on, Nancy?
Why are you calling me Nancy, John?
Why are you calling me John?
Nancy, pull yourself together
before you make yourself and that kid nuts.
John!
-Would you call Robert?
-Robert?
Robert Englund.
You know, the guy who plays Freddy.
-Freddy who?
-Freddy Krueger!
Nancy, Freddy's dead.
Now, don't start losing it
like your mother did.
I love you, sweetheart.
Don't forget that.
I love you too, Daddy.
Now, get yourself some rest, Nancy.
Please.
Dylan?
DYLAN :
One, two, Freddy's coming for you
Dylan!
FREDDY:
Almost there!
NANCY : Listen, Daddy,
l've got a proposition for you.
I'm gonna go and get the guy who did it.
And l want you to be there
to arrest him when I bring him out, okay?
THOMPSON: Nancy, just tell me who did it.
I'll go get him, baby.
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy.
Yeah, sure.
Dylan's sleeping pills?
DYLAN:
Say how they find their way back home.
lt's important.
Bread crumbs. Dylan.
FREDDY:
Too late, Heather.
Too late.
Dylan.
Join you.
You've given me a way to join you.
Yes!
DYLAN:
Mommy!
Aah!
DYLAN:
Mommy!
Dylan!
DYLAN:
Mommy!
FREDDY:
Almost there.
HEATHER:
"The more she read...
...the more she realized
what she had in her hands...
...was nothing more or less
than her life itself.
That everything
she had experienced and thought...
...was bound within these pages."
"There was no movie.
There was only...
...her life."
Aah!
-It's just me.
-Dylan!
-Are you okay? Are you all right?
-Yeah.
-Okay. Where's the man?
-I don't know.
He had me, but then he let me go.
Meet your maker.
Pick a pet for the rug rat, bitch.
Fuck you!
-Mommy!
-Get out of here, Dylan!
DYLAN:
Take this!
Come here, my pretty.
I've got some gingerbread for you!
No! Dylan, run!
Mommy!
FREDDY:
Gotcha! Ha!
Mommy?
-Mommy!
FREDDY: Mommy!
Now, where's your mommy,
piglet, huh? Huh?
One, two, Freddy's coming for you
Dylan?
DYLAN:
Mommy!
Dylan!
Mommy!
Come to Papa!
Gonna eat you up.
No!
Dylan! Get out of there!
-Hey!
-Aah!
FREDDY:
No!
HEATHER:
Push him in!
Push!
Run!
Are you okay?
Oh, my-- Honey. Honey.
Oh, my God.
We're saved. The witch is dead.
And his mother covered him with kisses,
and they were safe.
WES: Heather, thanks for having the guts
to play Nancy one last time.
At last Freddy's back where he belongs.
Regards, Wes.
Is it a story?
Yeah. It's a story.
DYLAN:
Read me some.
"We open on an old wooden bench.
There's fire and tools
and a man's grimy hands...
...building what soon is revealed
as a gleaming set of claws.
And the claws are moving now...
...as if awakening
from a long and unwanted sleep.
Then the man lays one trembling hand
flat upon the table...
...and with his other,
picks up a thick, sharp blade.
Behind the lights,
faces watch from the darkness...
...ready to laugh or scream in terror."
