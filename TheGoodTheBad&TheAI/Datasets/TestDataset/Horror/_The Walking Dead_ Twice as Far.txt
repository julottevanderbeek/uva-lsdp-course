AMC's "The Walking Dead..."
I'd like to get
to know you a whole lot better.
What makes you think...
I want that?
You don't have to.
No one gets to clock out today.
It's a way out,
for them and for us.
Where there's life,
there's possibility.
I'm leaving.
You are not walking
out that door
unless you can tell me why.
No.
Morgan?
Wh-- why?
It'll give you
some choices next time.
Didn't even notice.
Got your bike back.
Yeah.
You got another one of those?
Thanks.
Those people you met, the ones in the
burnt forest, they took it from you?
Yeah.
You saved them, right?
Sorry.
It's who you are.
We're still stuck with that.
No, we ain't.
I should've killed them.
Hey.
The ones that took
you and Maggie...
what'd they do to you?
To us?
They didn't do anything.

So, if you didn't
already have plans,
I was thinking of making
my beef jerky stroganoff.
I'm good, thanks.
It's not exactly
a nice porterhouse,
but I promise it's better
than it sounds.
I'm sure it is.
What?
What are we doing?
Just tell me.
It's good either way.
It really is.
Okay.
- Okay is what we're doing?
- We'll do dinner.
Okay?
All right.
See you then.
Okay.
I didn't hear you guys.
Good.
Today's lesson will be
in the cul-de-sac.
Actually, can we do
something else?
Denise: After I got out
of DC, I just drove.
I remember seeing it right when I
realized I had no idea where I was going.
Edison's Apothecary
and Boutique.
It's just this little
gift shop in a strip mall,
but if it's really
an apothecary,
they had drugs.
Daryl: How do you know
they still got 'em?
It isn't that far.
I just wanna check.
And you and Rosita aren't out
scavenging or pulling shifts.
We'll go.
I wanted to check.
I just wanted to help.
How much time
you spend out there?
- None.
- Forget it.
I can ID the meds. I know
how to use a machete now.
I've seen roamers up close.
I'm ready.
- You good with this?
- No.
I'll go alone, if I have to.
You'll die alone.
I'm asking you
to make sure I don't.
I'm not babysitting her
by myself.
It-- the...
What?
Forget it.
-
- No, what?
I think maybe you're
disengaging it too soon.
I've been driving stick
since I was 15,
usually beat-up trucks
like this.
I mean, before-- you know,
before I left home.
My brother taught me,
so I just know.
Daryl.
Yep.
Stay here.
I got it.
This happened fast.
Tree rotted out.
It wasn't people.
Come on, it's clear.
What'd you find?
Bottles of booze.
Any takers?
No, thanks.
For later.
I'm not bringing these to the pantry.
I'm good.
They were kind of
my parents' thing.
Which is why they aren't mine.
That truck ain't gonna
make it past this tree.
- Come on, let's walk.
- Denise:
Looks like a straight shot
if we follow the tracks.
No.
No tracks.
We'll take the road.
That's twice as far.
Go whichever way you like.
I ain't taking no tracks.
We should stick together.
Abraham:
I see you've tied back
your Tennessee waterfall there.
Eugene: I won't lie. I liked it.
I may very well miss it.
The feeling of the billowy
curtain catching the breeze
some days was
straight-up bliss.
But brass tacks-- the hair
doesn't make the man,
the man makes the man.
Guard duty, weapons training,
changing up the hairstyle,
swigging some swagger with
the ladies, spitting game--
If you don't spit game,
you are game.
Man seems to be changing.
At least trying like hell to.
Makes me curious
what that's about.
It's simple, really.
As with any RPG, tabletop,
electronic, or otherwise,
the key to survival
is allowing oneself
to be shaped by the
assigned environment.
In doing so, a broad range
of capabilities are acquired,
allowing one to flip the script
and use said capabilities
to shape said environment
for maximum longevity.
I'm saying I'm in the
process of said stage two.
I've changed, adapted.
I'm a survivor.
Keep telling yourself that.
I've changed, adapted.
I've become a survivor.
About time.
I didn't mean to pick him
over you back there.
It's just...
You're holding it wrong.
Like this.
Thanks.
Who taught you?
You know, how to fight?
Sorry, I didn't mean
to bring up...
A lot of people
taught me a lot of things.
Years from now, he'll just be a
name in a long list of names.
All right, me and her
are gonna do this.
You're gonna stay back, got it?
Standard pin and tumbler.
Tick-tick-click,
easy peasy.
This the place?
It is indeed.
Okay.
You about ready
to spill the pintos
on what the hell it is
we're doing here?
Yeah.
Abraham:
Eugene.
We're gonna
manufacture bullets here.
I've been chewing
the cud on this
The Hilltop's dry,
our supply's finite.
So not only are bullets
vital for defense,
but per the law
of supply and demand,
a full cartridge is now
the coin of the land.
Making bullets from scratch.
Spent casings, but the
innards are all us.
And by us, I mean me.
And you think you can do that...
here?
With just this?
Well, the digs will require
a thorough scrubbing.
We'll have to scare up a
hella ton of lead, but, yes.
I most definitely almost certainly
think I can do that here.
That, my friend,
is some damn fine
genuine outside-the-box
thinking.
Where do we start?
Well, we should inform Rick,
talk with Olivia,
see what types of ammo would
be most valuable to produce.
I'm gonna hit pause so I can
kill that thing behind you.
Pump your brakes, Red.
I'm formally calling
dibs on this one.
Dibs is dibs.
Well, be my guest.
Get some.
Strike one.
Strike two.
Why did you--?
I called dibs.
You had zero
authority to--
To what?
Stop you from dying?
I had full control
of the situation.
You had better luck picking
up a turd by its clean end.
I'm gonna allow you to
apologize for saying that.
So how about
you do so right now?
Timmy down there almost
ate your face, dumbass.
All due respect, screw you.
Beg your pardon?
Dispatching walkers
is well within my skill set,
so screw you
for suggesting otherwise.
Let me get something
straight, all right?
Using your
this whole DIY ammo thing,
that is your damn skill set,
just like ghosting hostiles,
both of the undead and the
living variety, is mine.
Now, you truly want to survive
this world long-term,
I suggest you learn
that posthaste.
Okay.
Thank you for your protection.
I most certainly needed it
between here and Houston.
But your services
are no longer required.
The truth, plain and honest.
You've outlived
your usefulness to me.
Is that so?
Plain and honest.
-
- Home.
My services
are no longer required.
Find your own way back.
Asshole.
We gonna find out
what you had for breakfast?
Oatmeal.
Just so you know.
Hey.
You want me to hold
your bags, or...?
Yeah.
If you set 'em on the counter,
I can tell you which.
No, we're gonna take it all.
Are you sure?
Because--
No, it's fine.
-
-
It's just one.
It sounds like it's stuck.
-
-
What the hell are you doing?
Nothing.
Hey.
You did good finding this place.
Tried to tell you
you weren't ready.
We both did.
I know.
So was he older or younger?
Older.
By six minutes.
My parents came up with
the Dennis/Denise thing
on one of their benders.
Hilarious, right?
Nothing scared him.
He was brave.
He was angry, too.
It's kind of
a dangerous combination.
Sounds like we had
the same brother.
Hey.
This way's faster, right?
There's a cooler in there!
Might be something
we can use inside.
We got what we came for.
Nah, ain't worth
the trouble, come on.
Shit.
No, don't!
Oh, man.
I threw up on my glasses.
Hot damn.
What the hell was that?
You could've died right
there, you know that?
Yeah, I do.
- Are you hearing me?
-
You could've died
killing those Saviors,
both of you, but you didn't.
You wanna live,
you take chances.
That's how it works.
That's what I did.
For a couple of damn sodas?
Nope.
Just this one.
Are you seriously that stupid?
Are you?
I mean it.
Are you?
Do you have any clue
what that was to me,
what this whole thing is to me?
See, I have training
in this shit.
I'm not making it up
as I go along,
like with the stitches
and the surgery and the...
I asked you to come with me because
you're brave like my brother
and sometimes you actually
make me feel safe.
And I wanted you here
because you're alone.
Probably for the first
time in your life.
And because you're stronger
than you think you are,
which gives me hope
that maybe I can be, too.
I could've gone with Tara.
I could've told her I loved her,
but I didn't
because I was afraid.
That's what's stupid.
Not coming out here,
not facing my shit.
And it makes me sick
that you guys aren't even trying
because you're strong
and you're smart
and you're both
really good people,
and if you don't wake...
up...
and face your...
D:
You drop 'em now!
Well, hell.
You got something to say to me?
Step up on that high horse?
You don't talk much.
Still getting the hang of her.
Kicks like a bitch, but--
- I should've done it.
-
Seriously, I didn't
catch what you said.
I should've killed you.
Yeah, you probably should've.
Kind of begs
the question, right?
Who brought this on who?
I mean, I get that you'll just have
to take my word for this, but...
she wasn't even the one
I was aiming for.
Like I said, kicks like a bitch.
It's nothing personal.
Look, this isn't how we like to
start new business arrangements,
but, well, you pricks kind
of set the tone, didn't you?
What do you want?
D: I'm sorry, darlin', I
didn't catch your name.
I'm D, or Dwight.
You can call me either.
So?
What's your name?
Rosita.
What do you want?
Well, Rosita...
it's not what I want.
It's what you and Daryl
are going to do.
You're going to let us
into your little complex.
It looks like it's just
beautiful in there.
And then you're going
to let us take whatever
and whoever we want...
or we blow Eugene's brains out.
And then his.
I hope it doesn't
come to that, really.
We just try and start with one.
You know...
maximum impact
to get our point across.
So what's it gonna be?
You tell me.
You wanna kill someone,
you start with our companion
hiding over there
behind the oil barrels.
He's a first-class a-hole and he
deserves it so much more than us three.
Go check it out.
Fall back!
Fall back!
Rosita:
Of crosses
and bouquets
Where only death
remains...
Rick's coming.
How is he?
Bullet just grazed him,
but it's a good thing we
got him back when we did.
Antibiotics we picked up could
save him from an infection.
You here?
Present.
Good.
I was not trying to kill you.
I was looking for a moment.
You found it.
Do you apologize
for questioning my skills?
I apologize
for questioning your skills.
You know how to bite
a dick, Eugene.
I mean that
with the utmost of respect.
Welcome to stage two.
Don't need to welcome me.
I've been here a while.
I just heard.
You okay?
Abraham:
You have them, too.
That's still too short.
Come inside.
You were right.
I knew it when you said it.
Carol's voice: I wish
it didn't have to end,
It was never my intention
to hurt you,
But what we have
other people want, too,
If we survive this threat
and it's not over,
another one will be back
to take its place,
Rick sent me away and I
wasn't ever gonna come back,
but everything happened
and I wound up staying.
I can't love anyone because
I can't kill for anyone.
Carol's voice: So I'm going,
like I always should have.
