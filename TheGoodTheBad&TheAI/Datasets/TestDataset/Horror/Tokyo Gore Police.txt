My dad...
My dad is a police officer..
He is strong, kind,
and like a superhero.
He helps those who get
lost or lose something.
He works really hard for everyone.
I would like to become a
police officer, just like my dad.
Hey.
The criminal is Koji Tanaka, age 29.
Previous convictions for
robbery and abduction.
He's kidnapped and held
a female passer-by captive.
He has barricaded himself
in an abandoned building.
There is no time to
consider the circumstances!
Those of you in the riot squad,
don't go easy and please kill him off!
Divine punishment!
Secured!
It's an engineer!
Ruka, it's an engineer!

Ruka always shows no mercy.
She's definitely a model hunter..
There's no mistake. This one
is definitely an engineer..
Within these past few year's...
These so called "engineers,"
criminals who have
remodeled their bodies
to turn into ferocious, fiendish
murderers, have increased in numbers.
An engineer's main characteristic
is that when they're wounded,
their wounds become a dangerous weapon.
Also...
a key-shaped tumor is
always found within the body.
To kill an engineer, you have to destroy
or sever that piece from the body.
Where did they come from?
What is their objective?
The only thing that is clear is
that I have the duty to hunt them.
Because I am a police
officer, an "engineer hunter.."

Mama, are you open?
I'll come back another time.
I'm sorry. I'll leave.
It's okay.
You have a righteous job, right?
Then you should sit here boldly.

Come back to the station immediately!
I have to go.

When my father, a police
officer, died at his post,
the chief of this station
raised me like his own daughter..
To me, this place is the same
as a home with a waiting family.
It was supposed to be the same...
But...
I'm home.
I'm home.
Welcome home.
Here, Ruka.
Happy birthday.
Thank you, Dad!
Come on, hurry. You, too.
What are you saying is wrong?
What are you doing?
What are you saying is wrong with me?
It's okay. It's okay, so...
Please! Please, just tell me,
will you?
Let go of me!
What are you saying is wrong with me?
What are you saying is wrong with me?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Don't worry.
It's okay.
It's okay. Calm down.
Did it hurt?
It was so good.
Do you want to do it again?
W-What is it? I didn't.
This was consensual.
Extension fee.
Much appreciated. The next
is also here at 307. Hurry up.
If it goes over, even one
second, it's an extension.
I even made a "10-minutes left" call.
I was using a vibrator, so I
couldn't hear the phone vibrating.
Hurry up and go!
I'm sorry.
Come on.
Come on.
You're absolutely right.
That doesn't matter..
Just hurry up and pay!
Thank you for waiting.
Yuka, right? I understand.
Then may I have the hotel and the time?
Okay.
Okay, in 30 minutes.
I understand. I will make the girl
head over.. Please treat her well.
Yuka, in 30 minutes, SM play.
Don't be saying you don't
want to do things that hurt.
SM play is good money,
and you know that.
Right, right.
You just have to do it.
You want to do kinky stuff?
There are cuter and
younger girls for that.
How about Yoko?
I can call her right away.
Also, from now on, please
make reservations by phone.
There is a website and
a cell phone site too.
I'm not available.

You. Yes, you. What's up
with these documents?
Commit suicide by seppuku, harakiri!
Yes, I understand.
I'll commit harakiri.
If I was brave enough to
stop the harakiri, then...
If I had the courage to
say I couldn't do it...
If I was able to say my own self
was more important than my job...
Ah, he's done it!
Harakiri is also suicide.
Stop the Harakiri
Heaven's Punishment
Incident occurrence.
Scene of the crime is the
Tokyo subway Miyama station.
Again...
Once again, the body of a prostitute
has been discovered.
She was broken, cut into pieces
and packed up into a small box.
There wasn't even a drop of
blood at the scene of the crime,
but there was testimony that
they heard a security buzzer,
so the location of discovery and the
crime are thought to be the same.
Engineer?
Yeah.
With the cases so far....
Our point of view is that engineers
are generally simple berserkers
and they usually don't think
of evidence or their safety.
But the criminal this time is
carrying on everything pretty calmly.
It's definitely the same criminal.
Even though he's an engineer, this guy
is definitely trying to pick a fight.
If a newcomer like that has shown up,
it means he's trouble.
Ruka, we're counting on you.
Let's go stylish with wrist-cutting.
It's cute!
The design is cute.
When you cut, it doesn't hurt that much.
The blood becomes tastier..
Die!
No, no!
Wrist Cutter. G!
New product!
It's a cutter with a cute design.
It hurts! It hurts!
I-It's a mistake.
Ouch!
It's a mistake!
I-It's a mistake!
It's not me!
You have the wrong person!
I think that's enough!
It's not me...ouch!
Please, it's a mistake!
Ouch!
It really is a mistake!
Please forgive me!
It's a mistake! It really wasn't me!
An act of molestation
is clearIy a crime.
Remember....
Everything...
It cuts well. It cuts well.

It cuts well!
It cuts well. It cuts well.

I thought they stabbed each other..
There isn't any particular.
abnormality in your body.
For now there's evidence.
Once you catch your breath...
...stop by the autopsy room.
Let's go.
From this part of the face,
we didn't find the key.
But with this much evidence left, we
should be able to identify it right away.
Granted that it's still alive
after losing half of its face...
It's definitely an engineer..
Engineers...
We have to kill them by any means.
They are
humanity's new enemy.
Yes, I agree.
Extermination is the only answer..
What's wrong?
Are you okay?
You should rest today.
