-Just peachy.
We hired you for your reputation.
You better live up to it.

Yeah, I heard of you.
But I thought you'd be older.
Like a fine wine, I'm aging gracefully.
Thank you.
Any questions,
Mr Finnegan ?
Nope. I get paid to shut up
and do my job.
So I shut up and do my job.
You're not the least bit curious
as to where we're going ?
Like the sign says,
''If the cash is there, we do not care.''
Ve good.

- So what you realizing, Mamooli ?
Uh, well, that my goal in life
before I die...

- Like T. Ray's count.
Shut your face, Billy.
Australia's a count.
- Australia's an island.
- Well, technically, it's a continent.
A,
,
well, I'm interested.
oes he ever talk about
anything else but women ?
Nah, not that I recall. The only way
to shut him up is to shoot him.
- Yeah, that's right.
- Y

You ever thought about it ?
-  oh, ooh, ooh.
-
- oh, ooh.
-
- You know what I want to eat ?
,
-
- Yummy.

Y
Pantucci ! Pantucci !
You're not where I think
you are, are ya ?
Listen, this radar's still funky. I can
feel it, and it's a ve bad feeling.
You know how many uncharted
islands are out here ?
What is this, a talk show ?
I need some quiet time.
ver and out.
-
- Whoa.
Hit you.
''h, shit.''
- I'm feelin' a real lack of love here.

Well, don't just sit there !
Go help him !
- You've got to do something.
- I find you live longer if you don't.
Finnegan !
Twenty hours out and back.
You beat my engine man to death,
it's gonna take a hell of a lot longer.
Which is okay by me,
since overtime will run you double rate.
He was nosin' around in my cargo.
kay, so he's nosey.
we kick this little
piece of shit overboard.
-
- Well, I vote we kill him.
Well, we don't vote here.
See, it's not a democracy.

for the hearing impaired.

This could be messy.

That's a year off my life.

Good evening, mademoiselle.

photograph, is it ?
- Let me see.
You're wanted for burgla,
robbe.
My ex-boyfriend.
What ?
amass such an incredible record ?
- Trust me, it wasn't easy.

Uh-uh !
I believe that's my card.
- Thank you.
- o we have a brig on this ship ?
Yes, we do, sir.
But it's not finished yet.
- Can't put a lady in the brig !
- True.
But you, mademoiselle,
are no lady.
Hey, watch it !
Hmm. And you, Mr anton,
are no gentleman.
w. w !
You ever pull that shit again,
I'll kill you myself.
Hold still,
you big dummy.
I'm sor. It stings !
Hey, do you think we could pull over ?
h, yes, my little love bug,
- I think I need a higher dosage.
- You always need a higher dosage.
- How many of those things are there ?
- Huh ?
I don't know. ight or nine of'em.
nough to sink a damn aircraft carrier.
This is just great.
Now I got bombs in my basement.
Maybe it's just me, but if you'd ask a
question or two before accepting a job--
,
What kind of life philosophy
is that, man ?
Torpedoes. What the hell
are they gonna do with torpedoes ?
Yes !
Gentlemen.
Say hello to the hinese...
M 1 -L1 triple-pulse
assault rifle.
,
- A
- Yeah !
heers, babe.
Mmm.
Mmm.
- What ?
C,
All thermal and laser imaging generating
a negative white screen response, sir.
Right. Switch to
auxilia power, Mr Lewis.
k.
- Maybe it's the storm, sir.
- No, no. That's nonsense.
- This ship is impervious to weather.
- an we still send ?
This equipment is state-of- the-art !
Top of the line !
Mr anton, please !
without radar or any form of imaging;
we are sailing blind.
- No way to communicate our situation.
- I have something here, sir.
- What is it, olin ?
,
Probably just
a pod of whales.
Moving at 31 knots, sir ?
I don't think so.
- Where's it coming from ?
- irectly beneath us, sir.
and rising ve quickly.
.
.
Ninety, eighty.
- .
- What are they ?
Fifty metres.
!
-
!
- What the hell is that ?
- I don't know.
!
It's a torpedo launcher.
- I-- I don't like this.
- Yeah, I know. Neither do I.
- How much longer ?
-A,
we'll be right on top of,
uh,
- whatever's out there.
Hang on !
-
-
-
- A
I got no power coming from Jezebel.
She's out cold.
Shit !
What the hell did we hit ?
Get it off the cases !
What the hell was that ?
Whatever it was,
it nearly took my bloody head off !
-
A direct hit on any of these warheads
and pfft ! We'd be histo, mate.
We got a hole in the starboard
bow the size of Nebraska !
Y.
We're hell and gone
from the nearest land.
There's no way a speedboat
gets out this far. No way.
w ! Shit, man ! Finnegan, nothing
works ! Hercules is shot to shit.
His gears are all mangled.
His cylinder head seized up, I think.
We have a job to finish,
a schedule to maintain.
- Man, would you listen to this crap ?
- Shut up, grease monkey !
Hey, get your asses up here !
Absolutely.
-
-
We'll take over from here.
Not any more.
If I can get into
the  machine shop,
yeah, maybe I can fix
this hunk of junk.
She ain't gonna run pretty,
but she'll run.
They've armed all
the bombs, man. They're alive.
A
- Finnegan and the grease monkey
will come with us.
- Wait a minute.
-The three of us stick together.
-From now on, you'll be
sticking with me.

Finish the torpedo launcher
and watch the lady.

This is worse

Why ain't it movin' ?
I don't know.
All right, gentlemen.
- You know the drill.
- kay, let's move out !
Bingo.
- You're not gonna need your guns.
- What if they attack us, man ?
This place is a mess.
You want me
to call housekeeping ?
Use any and all force necessa.
The intimidation factor must be high.
There's a lot of passengers
on this ship.
That was kind of fun.
Well, it was.
body's in the atrium.
We'll pin 'em down there, then split up
and finish the job. Sound off !
- Bridge !

Shit.

I got a really bad feelin'
about this.
Where the hell is evebody ?
Well, the lifeboats,

-
What the hell was that ?
Yes. Not bad.

Yeah. But he wasn't
supposed to stop the ship.
It's like-- It's like
eveone just... vanished.
Turn up the pump, you idiot !
We're sinking.
I'm the one supposed to be
in charge around here.
-
Billy, Billy, are you there ?
- What ?
What do you mean no passengers ?
How could there be no passengers ?
nly an idiot
would be out in this rain.
The hulls on these ships
are supposed to be impregnable.
If the hull's impregnable,
why are my feet wet ?
h, my God. He's right.
You're right. Yeah.
You got a real big mouth
on you, you know that ?
Yeah, I know that.
I don't like you.

Man, this water's freezing !

We've got to get off this ship.

What the hell was that,
Finnegan ?
I don't know !
I didn't get a good look !
If I don't,
I ain't goin' back to get 'em.

- Trust me, lady,
it ain't any better out there !
- I don't care ! I'm outta here !
- Will you relax !
- Who the hell are you ?
- Who the hell are you ?
- I think she broke my nose.
Give me a chance,
I'll break the rest of your face.
- Not that anyone would notice.
- What is this about ?
-
- That's what I've been ting
to tell you.
-
- rop it !
- Now !
- rop it !
o it.
- They didn't make it.
- What the hell happened ?
- I didn't kill anybody.
There's somethin' on this ship.
!
No ! It's not bullshit, Mr Hanover.
There are things on this ship !
- T. Ray was my-- You killed him.
- I heard you the first time.
- Stand down, you !
And you, tell me what happened.
- Infested with what ?
- I don't know ! How do I know ?
-
-
-
,
-
-
What the hell is that ?
Hey, guys, you don't mind if we
get off this thing now, do you ?
That's a good idea.
You back off, Finnegan.
Holy shit.
Look at that.
Now what ?
-
-
ome on.
There's nowhere to hide.
And then suddenly they were evewhere.
Th-The passengers all panicked.
Trouble is, nobody knows we're
in trouble. ouldn't send an S..S.
,
mon capitaine,
- Yeah, man, call in the Marines.
- Yeah, let's do it now.
- Something has jammed the systems.
- Not something.
Someone.
Who are you ?
Hanover had a connection
on this ship,
somebody to knock out
all the communications.
Ve quick, Mr Finnegan.
- Is this true, anton ?
Answer him.
- Answer him, you son of a bitch !
-
- For God's sake, man, why ?
- amn it !
Four hundred eighty-seven
point six million dollars.
The insurance.
You loot the ship, and then
you sink it for the insurance.
I spent my whole life,
my entire fortune, building this ship.
I'll be damned if I'm gonna lose it
to a bunch of pencil-necked bankers.
is a hell of a lot more than
we're ever gonna take in.
You mean, we're all gonna die
because you screwed up on the math ?
What about the passengers ?
Were they insured ?
I may be a crook,
but I'm not a savage.
- You despicable, lousy bastard !
-
- Y
!
-A!
!
!
!
!
- What ?
- I like it.
-
-
- h,Jesus hrist !
-
- Good God, it's Billy !
-
Jesus no ! no !
- ver here now !
- Right here ! Right here !
-
Jeez Louise, lady, give a guy
a heart attack, why don't you ?
-
!
What are these things ?
So, um, you got a boat waiting outside. Is that right ?
- Yeah.
- kay. Let's make a deal here.
Y,
And I can have
whatever I want.
Yeah, whatever you want.
an you get me
a cold beer ?
Funny.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
Time to go !
- I owe you one.
- amn right, you do.
Get me off this boat alive
and we'll call it even. eal ?
eal.
Please tell me
you're a man of your word.
-
- anton, get me-- Aah !
- C!
-
at this, you wankers !
the ttoia are about
as long as a pencil...
with bodies about
the size of a golf ball.
have been found to eat
full-grown sharks.
A
Well, you do the math.
This, uh--
This is not good.
Are we talkin' some kind of
mutated sea monsters here ?
The ttoia
are ve crafty.
,
and then they-they crush them
between massive jaws.
Yeah, and then they
eat you, right ?
They drink you alive,
!
You stay here and give
all the orders you want.
Yeah, man.
I second that motion.
At the end of this passageway,
there should be an underpass
on the port side...
- that'll take us to the upper levels.
- The starboard.
- Who do you think gave
you those blueprints ?
-
I ask you, man,
could it get any worse ?
Thanks,Joey.
They must have ripped a hole through
the hull. That's how they got in.
The power of these things,
it's-it's awesome.
- I'm glad you're so impressed.
- Shit !
- There's no way out through this door.
- It's buckled right to the frame.
- We can't go back the way we came.
Any ideas ?
- He's right.
- How far ?
-
-  It's 20 metres.
- Somebody's gonna have to go and check.
- I volunteer to wait here.
- Me too.
- No way.
I'll go.
But you're comin' with me.
,
- That means it's safe to come through.
- kay.
Hey ! It's mine.
Let's give the lady
a real gun, shall we ?
You know how
to use that ?
Yeah. If something comes at me, I'll
just pull the trigger till it goes away.
C
k.
I can handle it.
I think it's your turn
to car the parts.
This is turnin' out to be
one hell of a day.
ome on. Up.
I don't mean
to sound like a pussy,
an you just get asthma ?
-
-
- h, my God !
-
Jump !
- Fuck !
-
-
-
ome on, you son of a bitch !
ome on ! ome on !
-
-
h ! Aah ! I'm outta here !
I'm outta here !
ome on, buddy.
There you go.
- Where's Mason ?
- It got him.
- Shit ! Not Mason !
!
!
- There are more elevators
through that hatchway over there.
- Fuck elevators.
I ain't goin' up
in no more elevators, man.
I agree with these gentlemen.
How much longer before
we can expect a rescue ?
- I'm not waitin' on any rescue party.
It'll be another 24 hours before
they start searching for us.
Are you saying they're not even
gonna start looking for this ship...
Makes for a bit of a tight jam,
don't you think ?
- Are you insane ?
- No. No, man. He's right.
They're right.
This is the galley for the crew.
With these hatches closed, there's
no way those things can get in here.
You wanna wind up in jail,
Mulligan ?
I don't care what you do, but I'm gonna
keep on goin'. It's our only chance.
Back on !
They're wiping us out one at a time.
I'm not stayin' down here,
and that's a fact.
- Now, back off that hatch.
- I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I swear to God, I'll kill you.
- I'm not mucking about here.
- on't get hasty, man.
- We're not staying here, Mulligan !
- I say we are !
-
You back off right now,
soldier,
before I put you down.
And then he corked it
and sealed it tight...
and threw it
to a baby octopus.
Now, the octopus,
he felt his way
all around that bottle.
he got the cork off,
slid inside...
and ate the fish.
And the moral
of this sto is ?
We'r e th e fish .
The ship's already starting to sink.
What if they don't get here in time ?
Look, Mulligan,
you can do whatever you want,
,
pray to God that my boat
is still there...
and those things
aren't crawlin' all over it,
and then I am gonna
bail the hell outta here.
What ?
What ?
Y
Y!
-
-
Y
-
- Shit !
They're closin' the damn hatches, man !
They're closin' the hatches !
-
-
They're herding us !
Wait, wait. Now you're tellin' me these things can think ?
They're pushing us
toward the bow of the ship.
- Are you comin', or what ?
- Y
I'm right behind you.
What the hell is this ?
Where's anton ?
Now what ?
Go ! Go ! Go !
What is this ?

-
-

It's gonna sink !
It's going to sink.
-
-A!
Hey !
Hey, did you see that ?
Yeah, I see it !
We gotta get to it ! ome on !
- That heap of junk is your boat ?
- You got a better one ?
Wait a minute.
What if those goddam things
are crawling inside it ?
We'll have to
take our chances !
Then what are we doing ?
Trust me !
I got a plan !

Wait ! Wait !
Shit !
Give me that key,
