I'm sorry.
Sir, she's breaking out!
What are we looking for?
She's gone over the fence!
A couple of trains
came through here
around the time she escaped.
Could she get this far
in that time?
- Is she that fast?
- She is that fast.
- And this, too?
- 3.10.
- $3.10?
- Right.
- Here's your change.
- Thank you.
Can I help you?
The total's 17.95.
Here's your card.
Are you buying those?
Have a nice trip.
It's a brown tweed bag
with leather trim.
Porter was going
to put it on the cart.
This is the cart,
but there's no bag.
This was the largest earthquake
to strike an urban area
in nearly 50...
He's riding Green Lightnin'.
Enjoy the view.
Excuse me.
We shouldn't be seen together.
- Do you think Arlen suspects?
- No.
Tickets, please.
Are you travelling alone?
What, you're 12?
Someone going to meet you
in Los Angeles?
We'll say you're 11.
You only pay half-price.
Can't believe
our little girl did this.
She's not a little girl.
DNA typing proves it was her.
She could be in Chicago,
Las Vegas, LA, anywhere.
We should stop all the trains.
And have the police ask
questions we can't answer?
Put key personnel at every stop.
I want a team to hunt her down.
Good morning, Jill. Thank you
for taking care of my cat.
We will, won't we, Lorca?
I won't be gone very long.
- Take care of yourself.
- Bye-bye.
Do you still have problems
with people at work?
They say I'm the weird one,
I'm the strange one.
Why, because I have feelings?
Because I feel?
There's someone at the door.
They can come back
at the end of the hour.
That's for me.
Sorry to interrupt.
We need your help, Dan.
I know. Got to go.
Oh, God.
Mr Fitch will be
with you all in a moment.
We all must be here for the same
reason, whatever that is.
I'm Dan Smithson, and I don't
know why I'm here either.
But they said they needed me
and it was very important.
What do you do, Dan?
I...l'm an empath.
Sometimes they show me
awful things people have done
and I try to tell them
why they did it.
What qualifies you for that?
I feel things deeply.
What am I feeling right now?
You want to believe
that nothing affects you,
that...you're not afraid
of anything.
But you're curious,
just like the rest of us.
Steven Arden, Harvard
Anthropology Department,
expert in cross-cultural
behaviour.
Laura Baker.
Molecular biologist.
And who are you,
and what do you do?
Preston Lennox.
And if I'm here, the shit
has definitely hit the fan.
What exactly is
your area of speciality?
I'm a freelance solution
to some of our
government's problems.
And what might they be?
The kind that people don't
usually like to talk about.
You hunt people, don't you?
I guess so.
You in here, honey?
It's a little late for TV.
You in here, honey?
Good evening. I'm Xavier Fitch.
I'm in charge of this operation.
In November of 1974,
a small group from S.E.T.I. -
Search for Extraterrestrial
lntelligence -
sent out a message
to whoever might be listening.
They sent
about 0.25 of a kilobyte,
including structure
of human DNA,
map of our solar system,
population of the earth,
helpful facts like that.
In January of 1993,
they received a message back
from an extraterrestrial
unknown source.
That's great.
Intelligent life
beyond this planet?
Yes.
There were two communications.
The first was
a superior catalyst for methane.
We can now produce
an infinite amount of energy
from this clean fuel.
This convinced us this was
a friendly intelligence.
The second message turned out
to be a new sequence of DNA,
with instructions on how
to combine it with ours.
You can get feedback on it
from Dr Baker here.
Basically, the new
combined DNA sequence
was injected into 100 human ova.
We got seven to divide.
Four petered out.
Two were stored
in liquid nitrogen,
and we let one grow.
That's its code name - Sil.
That's after two hours...
one day...
two days.
- My God.
- This growth is amazing.
That's a week.
It's a girl.
Yes, l...we decided
to make it female
so it would be more
docile and controllable.
Controllable?
You guys don't get out much.
That's one month
after she was born.
So you kept her caged?
We decided it would be safer.
She didn't like being
locked up or being alone.
Didn't she?
She's hiding something inside.
You're right, Dan.
This is three months
after she was born.
Watch carefully.
- What was that?
- Back the tape up.
Watch her eyes.
Rapid eye movement...
She's dreaming.
She's having
horrible nightmares.
It's some kind
of anxiety reaction.
Got me a little anxious.
It made the research team
anxious, too.
The decision was made
to terminate the experiment,
to run more research first.
- You were going to gas her?
- That was the decision.
It makes you feel bad...
..that you had to kill her.
I don't know.
Wow.
Yes.
Yesterday morning the body
of a transient was found
in a siding near Salt Lake City.
Preliminary DNA tests conclude
he was killed by our creation.
- Have you found other bodies?
- No, not yet.
You will.
She's a predator.
Her eyes are in front so she can
judge the distance to her prey.
Right.
- Where did you learn that?
- I saw it on a documentary.
I caught that show myself.
Mr Lennox.
Yeah.
As the non-scientist amongst us,
are you clear
what's going on here?
I think so.
You created a monster
with some kind of formula
you got from outer space.
It got away and you want us
to hunt it down and kill it.
- Is that pretty close?
- I guess.
You don't want us to capture
her alive and study her?
Laura, this is a
search-and-destroy operation.
Nobody asks me to find things
they don't want dead.
I'm sorry for you.
Yeah, well...thank you, Dan.
I'm sorry for her.
May I have
your attention, please.
Welcome to Los Angeles,
California.
All passengers please disembark.
This is the final boarding call
for train number 12
to Santa Barbara, San José,
San Francisco and Seattle.
- Something bad happened here.
- No shit?
Crushed her larynx.
She was afraid.
She's frightened.
Hungry, too, by the looks of it.
She's definitely not on a diet.
She's storing up calories.
- Any ideas?
- Oh, my...!
Well, that looks like
some sort of...chrysalis,
some kind of cocoon.
Are we looking for a giant moth?
If that is a cocoon,
she'll be fully-grown now.
Fully-grown.
Our people were looking
for a child.
She is a child.
It stinks in here.
I'm going outside.
Get the conductor's l.D.
and credit card numbers.
Let's assume she took
them with her.
I'll see to that.
She kills
if she feels threatened,
and has no remorse.
Los Angeles is perfect
for her. Anything goes.
Very little is taboo
or unacceptable.
Whatever she does,
no one's going to notice.
Well, Los Angeles is where
the battle will be fought...
and won.
You look very pretty.
Do you have a hundred?
Here we are.
You ought to be more careful
with your money.
Not every body's as honest as me.
Are you foreign?
Do you speak English?
Yes.
Here. You keep this.
Here, let me take this.
Be careful here.
Yes.
Watch your step.
Our laboratory is being moved
to some empty virus research
labs at the university.
It'll be operational by 8.00.
- We'll go over in 15 minutes.
- What are we going to do?
Process the evidence
we collected on the train.
Couldn't we grow this creature
with just its own DNA,
so we can investigate
its vulnerabilities?
That'd be good.
Like to know how it feels.
If we could see it
without the camouflage...
Then we'd know what
we're dealing with.
Couple of bozos just ran out.
Yes, young lady, can I help you?
I want a room.
Hi. Come here often?
What's your sign?
Tired of brunette?
Change the colour of your hair.
Colour-tress.
I've just increased
the magnification.
When I pierce the cell,
the foreign DNA
will be introduced.
Shit! The camera's
just gone down.
Um...excuse me.
Do you have a replacement?
Yes, but it'll take time
for a technician to come over.
It's a simple operation
to replace it.
Are you saying you can do it?
Sure. I just need somebody
to give me a hand.
- No technicians in there.
- I'll do it.
I'll do it.
- A man of action.
- That's me.
Can you get that one for me?
Give me the camera.
Something's...something's wrong.
Christ, it's started already.
Get the top back on.
- What?
- Get the top back on.
Here you go.
It's penetrated the cell.
He dropped the bolt.
- Find the bolt.
- I'm looking, Fitch.
Can they hear me?
Get the top back on
then I'll let you out.
- It fell through the grate.
- Can you lift it?
This isn't going to work!
Get the bolt
from under the grate!
- The floor's welded down.
- Oh, my God!
God, I've never seen
anything like this.
I can't let them out.
Come on!
Fitch, let us out of here!
Open the goddamn door!
Not till I know what's in there.
- Let them out!
- I can't!
Tell me it's going
to stop growing, Dan.
- Open the door!
- Press!
What the fuck is that?
Laura, get to the other door!
- Let her out, Fitch!
- I can't do that.
- Motherfucker!
- What's wrong with you?
It's breaking out.
I'll burn it! Out of the way!
If you can't destroy it,
I have to burn the whole room.
You got two minutes to kill it.
Use the gas line
as a flame-thrower.
It's under the table!
- Open the door!
- Shut up, Dan!
One minute remaining.
It stopped moving.
I think I killed it.
It's dead. Open the door.
Let them out.
Oh, God, it's not dead.
What will we do?
Open the door!
- Let them out!
- I have to follow protocol.
- Protocol?
- For running this experiment.
You didn't tell them that!
Fitch, let them out.
- Let them out!
- I have to follow protocol.
Get out!
I had no choice!
We burn the room
if anything goes wrong.
Where can I find a man?
There's plenty of guys
at the ld round the corner.
You'll meet somebody there.
Thank you.
Just look for the long line.
Oh, I need your credit card,
for long-distance calls,
room damage, so forth.
Credit card?
Plastic...Amex, Visa?
There you go. Thanks.
Hey, wait a minute.
You don't want this
falling into the wrong hands.
No.
Yeah.
The conductor's
credit card has turned up.
Let's go.
You two.
Enjoy yourself.
You, legs, you're in.
Hey, where are you from?
- I'm foreign.
- You're what?
I'm foreign.
Foreign, really?
I've a party to go to
and no one to take me.
- I'll take you.
- You will?
I'm going to go to the little
girls' room. Wait here.
I'll be right here.
What's his name,
Greg or something?
Whatever it takes, right?
Hey, all's fair in love and war.
Buddy.
Can't see much on that.
Get this tape back
to the lab. Enhance it.
She looks nice.
Have you any idea
where she went?
I'll find her.
She wanted to meet a man.
I suggested the ld.
Get the tape.
I've a party to go to
and no one to take me.
- Where is this party?
- I don't know.
You can't park there.
You can't go in there.
What's going on here?
Nobody leaves the club, nobody.
There's always some action
in this part of town.
..blue-eyed blonde.
Who did she leave with?
Blue-eyed blonde leaving
with a guy is hardly news.
Name the top attractions.
Assume he's socially adept.
A friendly guy, not an asshole.
- Robbie left with a blonde.
- That's him.
Let me show you
the rest of the house.
Let me show you
the rest of the house.
I'm still sweaty
from that place.
Like it?
Yes.
I feel like a shower.
You want one?
I'm going to take one.
Want to get in
and take one later?
Take off your clothes.
I want to see you.
Very nice.
- Can you drive me back?
- What are you talking about?
- You know why we came here.
- I've changed my mind.
All right. You said no.
It's duly noted. Come here.
- I said I want to go.
- You're not leaving!
All right.
That's better.
What's happening?
Kills a girl, kills this guy.
She fits the classic
definition of a psychopath.
Nothing to inhibit her,
no moral sense,
no social structure.
She wasn't exactly smothered
with a mother's love.
I asked what was happening.
He did something to her.
She was angry .
She'll kill anyone
that gets in her way.
In her way of what?
Her life cycle. I think
she's trying to mate, reproduce.
So why did she kill the girl?
- Sexual competition.
- She's hard on the competition.
Now she's mated.
No. He's still got his pants on.
- She's frustrated.
- Who isn't?
What is her problem?
Maybe she rejected him.
She probably has
some special senses.
Rats can sense genetic damage
in potential mates.
We can test his body
for any defects
that would have made him
a loser, essentially.
Needles. Maybe he was some
kind of doper or diabetic.
Either way would have
made him unacceptable.
All right.
Insulin. Diabetic.
There you have it.
- But why kill him?
- I guess he pissed her off.
Some men don't like rejection.
Put an APB out
on this guy's car.
I want to check out the motel.
More docile and controllable?
What do you think, Dan?
I think she'd want to be alone.
I don't think she'll come here
with all these cars out front.
Could she find
her way back here?
She could.
What is it?
Maybe menstrual blood.
If she's menstruating,
she's capable of reproduction.
Yes, I know.
Oh, Jesus.
- Excuse me.
- Call the paramedic!
The video enhancement
is not all that great.
How old do you think
she is? 20? 23?
Her reproductive system
should be fully developed.
Her biological clock
must be in hyperdrive.
She wants a baby.
If her offspring's male
and develops
at the same rate as Sil,
it could be capable
of reproduction in six months.
God knows how many females
it could impregnate.
Fitch.
When a predatory
species is introduced
into a closed
ecological system,
the extinction of the weaker
species is inevitable.
They found
the murdered guy's BMW.
- And what is her name?
- I don't know.
So who are you?
Thought I'd come by
to make sure she's O.K.
Is she insured?
I don't know.
Put it on my credit card.
Guys like you are hard to find.
Get a lab workup on that, stat.
Arrange to get her up to X-ray.
It looks like
a scapula fracture.
Your sh...your shoulder.
What's going on?
Doctor, we need you.
- A burn victim just came in.
- What's going on here?
Did you see her shoulder?
Doctor, please.
We need you immediately!
- You're O.K.
- I'm OK.
I was sure you
were seriously injured.
I'm OK.
- It's a miracle.
- Can we go?
Did the doctor say you could?
Yes.
We'll send somebody over.
We'll send somebody over.
A doctor at Parkbay Hospital
called in with some weird story .
We should check it out.
Laura, Press,
take a car. Check it out.
Parkbay Hospital?
Yeah, Parkbay.
She walked.
She walked.
That way.
Not too long ago.
Got some fruit and cheese here.
- What is that?
- What, the hot tub?
Hot tub.
I love this place.
It's away from the traffic
and all the people.
Here. We'll immortalise
the moment.
Look at the camera.
She reformed her bone structure!
- It's her.
- Who checked her in?
Let's find out.
This guy put it
on his own credit card.
Here's the file.
John F. Carey.
You haven't got
a driver's licence,
home address,
social security number?
I only got an imprint
of his credit card.
Can you give us a print-out?
No problem.
Want some candy?
It's an address in the
Palisades and a phone number.
Tell Fitch where we're headed,
and try to call Carey.
I better get the phone.
I've got his machine.
Tell him he's about to copulate
with a creature
from outer space.
- Copulate?
- Yeah.
I like you.
I know.
It's not too soon
for us to be together.
No, it's not too soon.
You don't need these.
Hey, that's a little fast.
What's the matter?
Take it easy.
Just relax.
There's plenty of time.
What is it?
- I think someone's at the door.
- Don't go. Please.
- I want a baby.
- What?
Let's go around the side.
- What happened?
- It was a fucking squirrel.
- She was here?
- Yeah, she was.
Make sure she's not still here.
Perhaps we should check the body
for any evidence
they've had sex.
I used to be scared of blood.
Now I guess
I'm getting used to it.
Oh, yes?
- Hey!
- Please help me!
What's the matter?
We found this
in the living room.
She liked him.
Well, not enough.
Can't see any more on that
than we did on the video.
He didn't get
a very good picture of her.
There's no semen in the water.
Maybe she took it with her.
- She hasn't mated.
- We interrupted her.
I think we did.
Give me something I can use!
What have YOU come up with?
She's not scared of us,
that's for sure.
We're all beat.
We'll go to the hotel and rest.
Tomorrow night...
we'll go back to the club...
..stake it out.
She's not stupid.
She won't repeat herself.
And it provided
such a poor specimen.
I'm not so sure.
It's what she knows.
I'd rather try the club than
sit around the command centre.
She would make one
excellent biological weapon
if someone out there thought
we were a galactic weed.
You're saying she's the cure
and we're the disease?
That's well said.
"Baker, Laura.
"1735 Meander Drive,
Simi Valley, California."
- That's you, right?
- Last time I checked.
What do you do
for kicks out there?
Oh, pine for guys like you.
That's what I thought.
Anyone hungry?
No, thanks. I'm beat.
I'll just try to get some sleep.
Good night.
I'll have something
to eat with you.
Thanks, Dan.
- Do you ever have nightmares?
- Yes.
Please untie my hands.
I wouldn't hurt you.
I have them. I think
they tell me who I am.
Why are you doing this to me?
I don't know why I'm here.
I don't know who I am,
who sent me. Do you?
No.
Why do you think you're here?
I don't know.
Please let me go.
Please, please let me go.
I wouldn't hurt you.
I promise,
I wouldn't hurt you.
Yes, you would.
You just don't know it yet.
No, I wouldn't!
Please.
My hands are hurting me.
Oh, hey, thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, no!
No!
Laura and Press like each other.
They just don't like
to show how it.
- What?
- They like each other.
Whatever you say, Dan.
I'm going to get a bit of air.
I'll lie down in the van.
This is a waste of time.
Get the feeling
you're on a wild-goose chase?
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.
Get out of here.
This is my trash can!
It's you.
She's here!
- Dan, is that her?
- Yeah, she's over here.
Everybody get in the van!
We'll need the helicopters.
Try and block her at Mulholland.
Watch it!
My God.
We blocked the road
in both directions.
We've got to tell
the press something.
Just don't tell them the truth.
I don't buy her
showing up at the club.
or don't you trust your eyes?
Get all these people back!
Fitch, it doesn't feel right.
We found what looks
like a severed thumb
in the pocket of a door.
She may have caught it,
trying to get out.
The lab will determine
if it's hers.
It's all over.
You can go back to your lives.
Just like that, huh, Fitch?
I don't think so.
Hi, Chucklets.
Leave me a message.
And, Frank,
where are we meeting?
Waiter.
Waiter.
Well, I guess we won.
We won. Science lost.
I didn't think
we'd get her this easy.
Sounds like you'll miss her.
I think I respected her.
This has been a hellish job,
but I've really enjoyed
working with you three.
Why don't we have another round?
- Waiter!
- I don't drink, Art.
Tonight you will.
Want to dance?
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.
All right.
OK.
I know you don't have a family.
Do you have a girlfriend?
I've had a few, but they
don't hang around long.
I keep too many secrets.
Want to share one with me?
Right now?
Well, I know what you do,
and it doesn't scare me.
- Really?
- No.
Well, it does most people.
I wouldn't want
to never see you again.
I'm sorry . I thought
you were somebody else.
- You OK?
- I thought it was Sil.
She's dead.
Tests on the thumb proved it.
You got your test. I got my gut.
Maybe you don't want
this job to be over.
Maybe not.
So what?
Thanks for the dance.
Good night.
- What do you call this?
- A Long lsland lced Tea.
It's got tea in it?
Nope.
Smells nice. Can I try some?
Help yourself.
Does it work on your boyfriend?
Yeah, as a repellent.
He's in remarkably good shape
for a man his age.
One Long lsland lced Tea.
I like this cup...
these cups of tea.
What?
- That's great.
- What?
What?
Hey, give me one of those.
I like these cups of tea.
You guys, I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.
So?
She's going to bed.
I guess.
She still, uh...
wants to see you, though.
Maybe I'll go find out
if you're right.
Hate to be in this
during an earthquake.
Yeah. What floor do you want?
I like your perfume.
You do? Thank you.
Excuse me. I get out here.
Good night.
Yes!
- Hi.
- Hi.
Did you want something?
- Maybe.
- Maybe?
Housekeeping.
Dan, those two over there.
I bet they like
unusual men like us.
Women think I'm strange.
- I don't feel well.
- Just go and talk to them
I have to go. I think
you should leave with me.
I'm going to stay
for a while, actually.
OK.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Housekeeping.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I couldn't help wondering
what two very intelligent,
glamorous-looking women
were doing without dates.
I teach anthropology
at Harvard.
I lived in Boston for a year.
Froze my butt off.
This is Bill and Tony.
Give me those socks.
Stand up.
- How'd you get in here?
- I stole the key.
What?
I saw you downstairs
and thought
I'd come up and wait.
Whoa! This kind of thing
doesn't happen to me.
I just want to be with you.
Oh, yes. Yes!
Oh, yes.
What about protection?
She's here. She's here.
- Press?
- Huh?
Someone's at the door.
Who's there?
It's Dan. I got to talk to you.
Christ, what does he want?
What's the problem, Dan?
I just got
this terrible feeling.
Sil's next door
with Arden, Press.
No, no, no. She's dead.
There's somebody with him.
Did you knock on the door?
Yeah.
They're making a lot of noise.
They're having sex.
I KNOW it's Sil.
OK, I'll get dressed.
Oh, my God.
Well, I enjoyed that immensely.
- I felt it.
- What?
It's started.
What's started?
Life.
Oh, my darling girl...
I know some women believe
they know the exact moment
of conception...
Don't you believe me? Feel.
Holy shit!
I hope you're right
about this, Dan.
She's headed for the basement!
We'll take the stairs!
Laura, come with me.
If she's pregnant,
we got to get to her
before she gives birth.
We don't know what
we're dealing with.
She could have a dozen babies,
lay 1,000 eggs.
- God, did you see Arden?
- Yeah, the poor bastard.
If they make it,
we'll have her trapped.
The fire doors
only open from inside.
Holy shit.
The bitch went right
through a steel door.
Fitch! Dan! She got past us.
You saw her?
She was gone before we got here.
Look at the door.
- Where's Press?
- Down that tunnel.
She kills
if she feels threatened.
She must have come through here.
She went down here.
There's no other way.
- Yeah. She's down there.
- Let's go.
Stand back. I'll clear it out.
Which way do you think
she went, Dan?
I don't know. I'm not sure.
Think, for Christ's sake!
