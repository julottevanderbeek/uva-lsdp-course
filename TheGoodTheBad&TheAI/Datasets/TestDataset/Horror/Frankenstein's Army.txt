My name is Dimitri asna and I'm a graduate
of the all-union institute
of cinematography in moscow.
Uh, I was entrusted by our great leader
Joseph vissarionovich Stalin
to film the heroic deeds
of a distinguished reconnaissance unit
under the command of sergeant novikov.
I am proud to be part of this mission
in the great patriotic war.
Long live the mausoleum,
and long live  Stalin.
Dimitri:
Dimitri:
Give me.
There is the sniper's nest.
It's crucial that we destroy this nest.
It's a potential death trap
for our advancing troops.
Vassili, alexei, you flank it from the right and left.
Ivan and I will divert attention.
Let's get as much gear off as we can.
We need to be light.
Sasha, you stay here and you guard the gear, huh?
Take cover! Take cover!
Grenade!
Novikov:
Fuck off, dima.
Dimitri:
Sir, over here!
Novikov:
Sergei:
Ivan:
Novikov:
Sergei:
Do you read me? Over.
Dima, you think you got
some good shots today, huh?
Dimitri:
Can I ask you a few questions?
Krakow, Poland.
I escaped east when the Nazis invaded.
Here.
She is why I'm here.
Novikov:
Sergei:
Maybe.
Dimitri: Sergei!
Give me...
Vassili:
Moscow Jew boy! Where are you?!
You Polish cunt!
You are going straight to military tribunal!
- Give me the camera!
-
Dimitri:
-
Man:
- Misha.
-
Misha, I've got something.
Hello?
Tiger bear 3-0-3?
We read you, over.
Our position is 51-17-28 north
Hello. Tiger bear 3-0-3?
What is your situation? Over.
Our position is 51-17-28 north
- They can't hear us.
- Let me see.
Sergei:
Some mining village in the middle of nowhere.
We're not far.
-
- If we get a move-on, we can be there by noon.
Don't you think it's strange?
Who is tiger bear?
I thought we were the only reconnaissance.
They're Russians.
Our boys. They need help.
What more do you need to know?
You better inform mother.
I wish I could.
That crazy message
is the only thing I've received for two days.
Dima, pack your stuff away.
We won't wait for you.
Eh? Here's one...
Fucking fritzy.
Ah!
Dimitri:
- What's going on?
-
Do me a favor,
and stay with the squad.
Dimitri:
There's a lot of damage.
There's been fighting here.
Do you see anything?
Nothing. No Russians.
No Germans.
Not even a stinking goat.
All right, we go in through the trees.
Very slowly, huh?
And you...
Stay at the back.
And keep out the fucking way.
Dima! Come on!
Get down, you idiot.
Sergei:
I don't get it.
within 50 kilometers of here.
Who did this?
Let's move down to the church,
and take it from there. Move.
Ivan: I don't care who did this.
But they're bastards, whoever they are.
Dimitri:
-
- Dimitri:
-
- Sergei:
Are you all right?
Hey!
Come on, Sasha.
Sergei:
This is more like a factory.
Fuck...
Novikov:
None of your stupid games here, huh?
They could be dangerous.
Dimitri:
Why?
- What?
-
Why?
Vassili:
Hey, look it what we have found.
Novikov:
Sasha, is that you?!
Sergei:
Dimitri:
-
- Ah!
Dimitri:
- Novikov:  don't.
-
What are you?
Can you hear me?
Let's put you out of your misery.
Sergei:
Vassili:
Vassili:
Oh, my God, Misha.
Sergei:
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.
Don't move, don't move.
Sasha, for God's sake, turn that thing off!
Sergei: Calling mother.
Do you read me? Over.
Do you read me? Over.
We've been jammed.
It's the only explanation.
It's been days since I got a scratch out
of the damn thing.
What if we use the tower?
That's not a bad idea.
Not a bad idea.
Dimitri:
Where the fuck are they then, huh?
He's right, vasja.
Take the others.
I'll stay here with Sasha and the gear.
Go to the village, fine someone...
anyone... who can tell us what is going on here.
Correct me if I'm wrong, seryosha.
But I'm next in command after novikov.
I don't think so. Look at the stripes.
Who gives a fuck about stripes?!
I have been with this unit longer than anyone.
That doesn't mean you're in charge, vasja!
Oh, no?
Well, let's ask the others.
Dimitri:
Shut the fuck up, you Jew boy!
You are here just to make pretty pictures.
Ivan:
Let seryosha have his fun.
We can always slit his throat later.
Sasha:
Sasha?
You want him to be in command?
Have it your way.
But don't come crying to me
when he leads us into
some fritzy trap.
Stupid fucking film!
Dimitri:
Make another sound,
I'll fucking shoot your balls off.
Dimitri:
Dima, it'd be safer outside.
Do not get in my way.
Vassili:
Ooh, I have found some dinner.
Mmm!
Come here, little bunny.
Come over here.
Dimitri:
-
Vassili:
Alexei! Alexei!
We're supposed to get a prisoner, remember?
To interrogate, find out where our boys are.
Yeah?
What's the crazy old tramp saying, huh?
Dimitri:
Oh, no no no no no no. No no no.
I'm liberating your rabbits from fascist oppression.
- What is this place?!
- I do not understand.
What is this?!
Dimitri:
-
This I want to see.
What is going on here, huh?
Where has everybody gone?
Everybody's dead or run away.
What were they running from?
That's a weird camera.
Is that a microphone?
Are you recording sound?
I've never seen a camera like this before.
What were they running from?
I...
from... from things...
- What things?
- ...The doctor makes.
What things?
Where is the doctor now?
Shut it! Who give a fuck about this doctor?!
We want to know about tiger bear 3-0-3.
Ivan, hold him!
Comrade, listen. There was obviously
some sort of secret project going on here.
Ha, that's obvious, is it?
Tiger bear was even
sent here for this very reason.
Listen, if you find the doctor, you'll probably find...
fucking fascinating, comrade!
Now get the fuck behind the camera.
Where are the Russians?!
- Where?!
- I don't know. Aah!
I just feed the animals.
Where?!
I'll take you there.
Oh, you'll take me there?
You will never have to worry
about getting hurt ever again.
-
- Come on, let's go.
Keep moving!
Dimitri:
Shut up.
Here.
It's down there.
The Russian soldiers are down there?
Yes.
Down there?!
Yeah, you... you go, you'll see.
It's not safe here, vasja.
Let's just take him back to seryosha.
I'm in charge here, so fucking do what I tell you!
Show us!
No no, I wait...
no, you fucking show us! Come on!
Dimitri:
Where the hell?
Ivan, check that side.
- Vassili: What?
-
Shit! What the...?
Vassili:
-
- Dimitri:
Vassili:
Dimitri:
Ivan:
Vassili:
Dimitri:
-
- Ah!
Dimitri:
Get out!
Let's get out of here now.
Ivan:
Dimitri:
-
Dimitri:
- Ivan: Over here.
-
Oh, no!
-
- Dimitri: Shoot the motherfucker!
Come on!
- Get it off.
- No.
Vanja, I don't think that's a good idea.
Please...
Relax, my friend, I'm not giving up on you yet.
Vassili:
We're getting out of here.
Get back to your post.
You're supposed to be keeping watch.
Fuck you!
Those things, they appeared out of nowhere.
They could all around us
and we wouldn't even know.
Get the fuck out of the way!
I'll finish him off.
Fuck!
Ivan:
Vasja!
Who? Dima?
No, you idiot.
That tramp...
Set us up.
Tramp.
"I just feed the animals."
This is your fault!
You were supposed to bring a captive back here.
Dimitri:
You're an educated man, dima.
What do you think is going on here?
Only the Nazis would think of something like this.
Sewing dead people together...
And giving them knives for hands.
It's insane.
No, dima...
It's insane.
We'll move in the morning.
And then we'll find this...
Tiger bear 3-0-3.
They're dead.
And we will be too if we
hang around here any longer.
Vasja, go down!
Sasha!
Go around.
Hands up! Hands in the air!
Come on! Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Against the wall! Over there!
That's a girl. That's a girl.
No, no!
Sasha!
- Woman: No no no!
- Sasha!
-
- Enough!
Enough!
- Where are the Russians?!
- Please....
Where are the Russians?!
You are Russians, no?
There were other Russians here...
-
We've been hiding.
Just the four of you?
- There was a massacre.
- Who killed them?
The undead ones. Listen...
The gunshots, the fire light,
we must hide before they come looking.
Dimitri:
Dima! Leave this to me!
How many were there?
We don't know. He keeps making more.
We must hide now. Please.
This is bullshit. Let's just kill them!
What did he say?
Uh... uh, Fritz says it's okay if you shoot him.
He'd rather be shot by a real man than
ripped apart by those things out there.
Let's just kill them. Keep the girl.
- Come here.
- No no no no!
I'm trained nurse.  Look.
- I can help your friend. - Trained nurse?
I can help your friend.
I will help your comrade,
Just breathe, Vanya. Breathe.
Well, can you get it off?
I don't know.
-
I... I can try.
You heard him, bitch. Get on with it.
Okay, Vanya, we have to go on.
-
-
-
Ivan...
Sergei:
- Ivan:
-
-
I'm sorry...
- I'm sorry.
- Well, that was fucking useless.
No no no! We must work together.
We're only human.
Please don't hurt me. Please.
No no!
-
-
Vasja!
- No no!
- Vasja!
-
Fuck...
-
-
-
-
Alexei, hold on!
Dimitri:
Somebody, stop it! Stop it!
Sasha, Sasha, follow me.
-
Where is it?
-
-
Sasha:
My eyes... Sasha, Sasha.
Give me the camera.
Vassili:
Eva! Eva!
Sergei:
Radio:
Our position is 51-17-28 north
I don't fucking believe this.
Dimitri:
What's going on?
Why don't you ask comrade dima?
What?
Tell them.
Before I blow your fucking brains out.
- You don't understand...
- tell them!
There's no tiger bear 3-0-3.
I don't get it.
Here.
It's a radio jammer.
I couldn't understand why we were getting
no signal before. This is why.
Our comrade here was blocking us.
Cutting us off from mother.
And I was carrying the fucking thing!
He could use it to transmit the message
from his pack to the radio and...
And lead us here. So there is no...
No tiger bear, no Russian soldiers
needing our help.
Fucking bastard!
Wait, vasja. Don't kill him yet.
First I wanna know why.
We are not going anywhere.
Not going anywhere.
That Fritz must know the way. We'll follow him.
That fucking old fascist?
You don't understand.
We're not leaving.
- That's an order.
- An order?!
I'm gonna cut his balls off!
Here here here!
Read this document. I'm a full captain.
Your superior officer.
I have a list of every man
in this squad's family and loved ones.
If something happens to me...
You know what will happen to them.
- Dimitri:
Tell me...
Why didn't you just tell us?
Huh?
Why the trick?
- So you let us come unprepared?
-
I did not know the exact nature of the
work that the doctor was working on.
He's not a doctor!
He's a madman.
Capture?! What would
the glorious motherland want with...
This is none of your business.
Is there even film in that camera?
If these things are a Nazi weapon,
they've turned on their master.
Not so brilliant, huh, dima?
-
Fritz, which way?!
Dima, you can't be serious.
You want to go to the base of this thing?
- It's suicide!
-
Or killed. Captured or killed, you said.
-
-
-
-
- Sergei: Get out!
Come on, dima! For God's sake!
Close the door! Close the door!
Get in the fucking door!
Go faster! Close the door!
Get in!
Inside!
Dima, get over here!
Vasja, you fucking idiot!
What the fuck?
-
- Dimitri:
Dimitri:
-
Dimitri:
What? You crazy?
I've got a better idea.
- Vasja, get the boy.
- Right.
- In you go.
-
Hey! First, we'll take you down...
- Vassili:
Good boy, good boy.
-
- I've got you!
Hans, tell me what you see!
Pull! Pull!
Ah!
Dimitri:
Vassili:
You all right, captain?
Thanks, seryosha.
Dimitri:
-
After you!
-
Sergei: So, dima, you want to
continue your secret mission?
You do it alone.
-
- I'm taking my men out of this mad hole.
Vassili:
Traitors.
Fucking traitors.
All of them.
Comrades!
Come back!
I order you! Come back!
Fuck...
Screw you, vissarionovich Stalin.
Screw you!
"Serve the proletariat," my ass.
You will all be shot anyway!
You will all be shot anyway!
Fucking retard.
I'm going to hell.
I'm in hell.
Mama, papa...
This is my last roll of film.
Do not trust what they tell you.
I made a deal with the government.
They promised to let you go
in exchange for the doctor.
I don't think that's happening anymore.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
I'm going to miss you.
Oh, fuck.
Man:
Dimitri:
-
-
-
-
-
-
Okay, here's something good.
Not... not... not my finger. Not my finger.
Is it filming?
Yeah.
Here.
It's good.
Eat this.
It will make you strong.
It's
I'm not hungry.
- Eat.
-
I need you to be strong.
Do you like it? It's really good.
I have added some of my own ingredients.
I need you to be strong...
-
- ...To make a record of my work here.
A what?
For posterity, you know?
You're...
You're Dr. Frankenstein?
- Do you think you can do this?
-
Do you think you can do this for me?
Swallow.
Swallow...
Swallow.
Are you filming?
- Dimitri:
Come in. Go go go, follow me.
- Come.
-
Oh, don't be shy. Come.
My father said, "men would be more efficient
if they had hammers and screwdrivers
instead of fingers."
Here. Use this.
When I tried to do it with cats,
he told me it was a sin against God.
He... he beat me.
It's not a sin. It's simple mechanics, engineering.
Ugh.
Well...
after father died,
the Nazis closed the factory
and sent me to a camp.
Someone told the
He asked me if I could do the same with people.
So I used grandfather's notes.
His techniques were quite good.
- He needed thunderstorms, but now...
-
...I can do it with a generator.
receive and follow orders and...
-
They're not machines or puppets!
like the toys my father built!
Each one is still alive.
-
Go, hurry up.
I feed them with the same
- I gave you.
-
Oh oh!
Well, fuck you!
- Fuck you!
- Here they are!
At least one is still alive.
Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Don't do this to me.
- Fuck you all.
- Don't do this to me.
- Fuck you!
Fuck you! Fuck you.
-
-
- Fuck... son of a...
-
Shit. He'll be fine.
He'll be fine. I take care of him.
-
- Come come come.
- Come in.
-
Come in.
I want to show you something.
This is the generator.
-
It works! Ha ha!
It works!
Come with me. Come.
I'll show you something else.
- What?
-
What was that?
How far away would you say they are?
You telling me this because?
Of course.
It would give them a weapon
to use against Western allies.
To turn the whole world
into to socialist utopia, right?
And if I refuse?
Oh, fucking...
- In experiments...
-
...the fresher the specimens the better.
And if I can use flesh that is still alive,
I can perform miracles.
Tell me, which of these two...
Is a better communist?
Which of these two is a better communist?
Hans!
- Viktor:
So,
Viktor...
Hush now, dieter. You don't have to apologize.
I'm going to make it all okay.
Doctor, there's no time!
The red army's almost here.
- If you want to work for me you need to tell me now.
- Enough!
I said I would think about it. Now focus.
Hey!
- I told you to film.
-
Don't you see?
I can... I can end the war
by creating a new being
that brings them together.
I can make them stop.
I can make them understand each other.
I'll be right back.
Dima...
Dima... help me.
Help me, please. Please.
Dima, huh?
Don't you understand?
He's crazy. Dima, he's insane.
- Please.
-
-
I swear! I'll kill you!
I swear I'll kill you!
As you can see, the two halves of the brain
have been grafted together.
On the left side, the communist's.
Hold on.
Yeah.
On the right side, the Nazi's.
Yeah. That will be...
it's too much here. Okay.
I think...
oh, shit.
Okay, that's fine.
I can fix it.
The patient is no longer breathing.
Now...
For the final step.
-
It's obviously suffering from
a little readjustment problem!
I can do more!
How does that work?
I need a different lens.
How do you operate this camera?
Doctor, we had a deal.
Listen, we had a deal.
Huh? You will be safe in Russia.
What deal?
We have people there...
Orders... enemies of the state, huh?
You will be safe.
What about our deal?!
I'm afraid I am going to have to
refuse your generous offer.
You are signing your own death warrant.
If we don't kill you, your own people will.
Understand that?
Oh, yes, I know.
I was in a prison camp, remember?
But I have other plans.
No no no no, don't leave me! Don't go!
- Ah!
- I'll be leaving momentarily.
But there should be time for one last experiment.
No, you can't... you can't.
I can. I can!
Come here, come here.
Now what shall we do with you?
Maybe... maybe I will
build this camera into your skull.
That might be fun.
A man... a man of vision is always misunderstood.
But the film in your camera...
Will convince the doubters.
- You're insane!
-
You're not a doctor. You're sick! You're sick!
Oh, yes?! So I'm sick?
Everybody's sick... the Nazis, communists,
capitalists, everyone!
The sickness cannot be cured...
So it must be cut out.
And my creations will do that.
Your creations are fucking insanity!
Look at them! They're fucking cripples!
Okay.
My father...
Tried to have me locked up.
- He said I was emotionally crippled.
-
I had no choice.
I injected him with...
with a drug that paralyzed him.
But his eyes could still move,
so he could watch as I...
No no no, no no no!
What was that?
That is the beginning of the carpet bombardment.
I will not have time for you after all...
That is my comrades!
Coming to wipe you off the face of this planet!
The deal... the deal I offered...
I will make it better. Anything anything!
Tell me what you need. I will guarantee you!
Okay okay okay, I'm afraid after I go...
My soldiers may become a bit crazy.
What are you talking about?
I would love to tell you more,
but I've got to go.
So good luck, comrade.
Oh, the film.
Proof for the doubters
- to make them believe.
- Ah!
But it won't reveal my real secrets,
do you know why?
Look at me. Do you know why?
Because they are all locked up in here.
So I'm going to take your camera with me.
No! Sasha!
You fucking idiot!
Idiot!
-
Don't just stand there!
Let me loose, you fuck!
Sasha, Sasha, Sasha...
- S-s-s-Sasha, Sasha!
-
Sasha, no no no no no... Sasha, Sasha...
-
Sasha, no! Don't leave me! Please!
Please please please! Sasha!
- Don't leave me.
-
Sasha!
-
-
Sasha, listen to me.
I was only trying to help my mother!
- Sasha:
-
- Sasha:
Sasha, don't just stand there!
Do something!
-
- No!
-
