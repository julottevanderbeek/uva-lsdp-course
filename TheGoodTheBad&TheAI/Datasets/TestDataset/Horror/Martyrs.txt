Woman: Help!
Help!
Man on radio:
Squad en route. ETA two minutes.
Man #2 on radio:
Proceed with caution. Over.
You sure it's the building?
It's the one
the girl pointed out.
Clear!
Whoever was in here,
they didn't leave any scraps.
- Nothing.
- Man #2: Clear!
She was scared.
Man #3: Clear!
Could've just pointed out
the wrong building?
Yeah. Maybe.
Hi. I'm Anna.
You're Lucie, right?
That's what the sisters said.
Do you wanna play
or something?
Okay. Bye.
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord
my soul to keep.
If I die before I wake...
I pray the Lord
my soul to take.
Lucie.
Lucie, there's no one there.
Lucie, calm down.
It's okay.
No one's going to hurt you, dear.
Sisters, please, I need help!
There is no monster!
I sneak into the kitchen when
Sister Rachel was doing her beads.
They're still warm.
Man: The sisters say you've
become good friends with Lucie.
Does she ever
say anything about, uh--
about the people
that hurt her?
No.
What kind of things
does Lucie tell you about, Anna?
It's okay, child.
You can tell him.
She talks
about monsters a lot.
She said
they're still out there.
Monsters.
Has Lucie ever told you
what her monsters look like?
Hello?
No.
Get out.
Anna?
-
-
Lucie?
It's okay.
They're not gonna
hurt you anymore.
It's okay.
Lucie:
No one believes me.
Anna:
I believe you.
This old man, he played one
He played knick knack
on his thumb
With a knick knack, paddy whack,
give the dog a bone
This old man
came rolling home
This old man, he played two
He played knick knack
on my shoe
With a knick knack,
paddy whack...
You get back here
with those cookies!
I wish I could ride a cloud.
Let it take me
wherever I wanted.
Where would you want to go?
Wherever you go.
Do you believe her?
Do you believe the things
Lucie tells you about her monsters?
I don't know.
What's the plan for today?
Well, I'm gonna need
your rooms cleaned
before anyone goes anywhere.
I'm supposed to pick up Kim
in an hour.
Well, I just looked in your room.
You better call and tell her
you're gonna be late, real late.
- No.
- I thought Katy broke up with you.
Huh. Nobody breaks up with me.
See, I don't think
Katy knows that,
and neither does the guy
she was slobbering on
at the lake last night.
- Oh, yeah, you're full of shit.
- Hey!
Oh, he says it all the time.
Oh, not in front of me,
he doesn't.
What's not in front of you?
Brian said I was full of shit.
Oh, well, he's probably right.
Brian, after breakfast,
I'm gonna need your help downstairs.
Mom said I had
to clean my room.
Well, as soon as we're done.
Isn't it Nicole's turn?
You always let her slide.
That's because
I love her more.
Nicole: No! No!
Emmett?
No!
Sit down!
How old are you?
How old?!
I'm 17.
Did you know about the things
that your parents did?
Please.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Hello?
Anna?
I found them.
I need you to see them, too.
I need you, Anna.
Tell me where you are.
Lucie?
Lucie?
Oh, God.
- I didn't have a choice.
-
Lucie, what did you do?
But I had to.
I told you it was them.
No, no, no. You said that
you were gonna show me them.
You-- we were gonna
call the police.
The police? The police
would not have believed us.
And you know that.
They don't care anymore.
Nobody cares anymore.
Except for you and me, Anna.
I want to show you.
-
- That's him.
His face has changed
a little bit over the years,
but the eyes--
I know those eyes.
He's the one, Anna.
And her.
It's been too long.
You can't-- you don't know.
- You can't be sure.
- I am.
- Not sure enough to do this.
- It's them!
See.
- They knew.
- They?
The children.
- There's more?
- There's a girl.
Oh, my God.
They knew what their parents
were doing, Anna.
- They're guilty, too.
- No, no. No, they're not.
Anna, you have to believe me.
- You have to believe me. Please?
- No!
Anna, Anna!
Please, please.
Please, believe me.
I'm sorry.
I can't help you anymore.
I'm sorry.
Anna, please?
Anna?
Anna!
Wait. Please?
L-- I did it.
I did it. It's over.
I stopped them.
It's supposed to be over.
See?
I stopped them. Please.
No!
Stop, please!
Please, stop.
No! Stop, don't!
No! No!
It's here again, Anna.
It hurt me.
It's okay, it's okay.
I've got you, okay?
I'm not gonna let anything
hurt you anymore, okay?
Man: And I say unto thee,
love one another.
Do not treat the stranger
with disdain,
but love him, embrace him,
and take him into your heart.
-  Anna?
-  What?
- Please don't ever leave me.
- I won't.
- Promise?
- I promise.
Sister:
Shh! Quiet, girls.
...hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today day our daily bread.
For thine is the kingdom
and the power and the glory
forever and ever.
Amen.
Lucie, come on.
We have to go.
You should've seen his face
when he opened the door.
He recognized me, too.
I saw it in his eyes.
Now, Lucie,
before someone comes.
I can't help you here.
We have to get you
to a doctor,
someplace really far away.
After we get rid of the bodies
and clean the house back up.
We don't have time.
No, it's the only way
that it will leave me alone.
L-I have to wipe them away.
I have to make it like
they never existed.
Then it will have to let me go.
It's almost over.
Ready?
What's wrong?
Come here.
Come here, Anna.
- Can you smell that?
- Please stop.
Can you?
I've known that smell
my whole life...
from every time
that he beat me,
every time that he
walked into my cell.
And he told me
how perfect I was.
He told me I was the one
that they'd all been waiting for.
We need to get the others.
Why can't we just leave them?
I told you I have to do it.
It's the only way
it'll leave me alone.
I'm so tired.
- Lucie?
-
- Help,
Please help me.
You have to be quiet.
Help me.
I will, but you have
to be quiet.
Please. Please don't.
She's gonna hear you.
Help.
Please, please.
I have a car.
I'm gonna take your boots to--
- we just have to hurry.
- I can't leave my family.
You aren't leaving them.
We're just-- we have to go.
- I wanna see my children.
- Shh! Be quiet.
Lucie, stop!
- Why?
- I was just...
Why would you help her?
She didn't deserve to die--
What about all the things
she did to me?
I told you! I told you!
But you wanted her to live
instead of me?
No.
Then why would you
try to save her?
Why would you try to let her
do it all over again?
She wouldn't have hurt you.
I wasn't going to let her.
You're lying!
You never believed me.
You think I'm crazy...
just like all the doctors.
I thought once I showed you
their faces...
that you would
love me again.
Lucie.
No...
More...
Please.
No more...
please.
Lucie?
Lucie, stop!
- No!
- Don't touch me!
-
- Lucie!
Stop! Lucie.
There's no monster!
Stop, Lucie, stop.
No, no! no,
No, no, no!
No more, Lucie!
Stop, stop, stop.
It's me, it's me, it's me.
Okay. It's me.
Lucie.
It's gone, okay?
I'm gonna get you
some new clothes,
and then we're gonna
get out of here. Okay?
It's never
gonna let me go.
Lucie!
Lucie?
No, no. Please, Lucie.
Don't leave me. Please.
This old man,
he played two
He played knick knack
on my shoe
With a knick knack, paddy whack,
give a dog the bone
This old man
came rolling home
This old man,
he played three
He played knick knack
on my knee...
Hello, you've reached the Pattersons.
Sorry we can't get to the phone,
but we're probably doing something
much more important.
Girl:
Wait, wait!
Please.
- It's okay.
- Please, please, please.
Please don't hurt me.
No. I won't.
I have to find a key.
Wait, wait.
No, please.
Please, you can't leave me.
I won't, I won't.
I promise.
Wait!
Please, don't.
Don't leave me!
I thought you were gone.
Okay, come with me.
Hey, come on.
What's your name?
Samantha.
Mama called me "Sam."
Sam... I'm Anna.
And I'm gonna take you home.
Come on.
People are here.
I found her downstairs.
You were right
about everything.
- We have to go.
-
Upstairs.
Let's go.
Ready? Here we go.
This way. Come on.
Come on, hurry.
We have to come on.
Watch it.
There.
Get in there.
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.
Get down, get down, get down.
Don't move, don't move.
Shh. Quiet.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, Sam. It's okay.
We have to get to my car.
Move, move!
We're almost there.
Hurry!
No.
Leave her alone!
Anna!
Stop.
No.
What's your name?
Anna.
What are you doing here, Anna?
Where's Dr. Patterson?
He's dead.
His family...
did you kill them?
You're in a lot of trouble, Anna.
- Did you kill them?
- No.
- Your friend?
- Who are you?
What's her name?
I called the police,
and they're on their way.
Oh,
Lucie!
God, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Lucie!
Lucie!
-
-
Lucie.
Leave her alone.
Just fucking leave her alone!
-
- Lucie.
Lucie!
Anna: Lucie?
Can you hear me?
Are you there?
Please be there.
I need you to be there.
We are gonna get out of here.
I promise we are.
-
-
No! No, no!
Stop! Stop!
No! Aah! Ah!
No, no! no,
No, no, no, no, no!
No!
-
-
-
-
Do you want to live, Anna?
Open your eyes
if you want to live.
Ugh!
Open your eyes
if you want to live.
Mm.
You'll get another jolt,
maybe a dozen more.
Open them. You leave them
closed now and you die.
Come on. Come on.
Come on, open them.
No more.
No.
Anna:
No, no more, please.
-
-
The monsters aren't real.
The monsters aren't real.
The monsters aren't real.
You're gonna be
all right, Lucie.
It's almost over now.
One more stage,
and all your suffering will be done.
I'm so glad
you came back to us.
It's gonna be fine,
sweetheart.
-
-
Please stop.
Please stop.
Please stop.
Please stop!
He played knick knack...
On my door
With a knick knack
Paddy whack
Give the dog a bone
This old man came
Rolling home
This old man,
he played five
He played knick knack
On my hive
With a knick knack,
paddy whack
Give the dog a bone
This old man came
Rolling home.
Anna! Anna!
No. N-no.
No, no, no.
Man: Thank you all
for gathering here today.
Please be seated
so we may begin.
Hello again, Anna.
Help, somebody!
They can't hear you.
Not that it would matter.
They're all aware
of you being here.
What I said about calling
the police was true. I did.
I know.
It was your abbreviated 9-1-1 call
that alerted us.
That and your little excursion
downstairs to see Sam.
All outgoing calls
come through our system.
Without yours, we would've assumed
that the doctor's work with Sam
was proceeding as planned.
So I owe you my gratitude.
Without you, we would never
have gotten our dear Lucie back.
I didn't give her to you.
Of course you did.
What do you want with her?
Her gift, of course.
It's what kept her alive
during the doctor's work
when she was a child.
It's what gave her the strength
to spend all those years
trying to find him.
Lucie is very different,
of course.
But you already knew that,
didn't you, Anna?
You were ready to die back there
in your cell
rather than suffer any longer.
But Lucie is different.
Stronger.
What would kill you or I,
she can survive.
Well, physically, anyway.
Mentally, well...
...the monsters are there.
They've slipped through the cracks
that Dr. Patterson opened.
She's special.
It's easy to create a victim.
You lock a person up
in the dark,
and they begin to suffer.
And then you feed that suffering
methodically,
precisely to make it last.
The subject goes through
a number of states.
And then there is trauma,
and it opens those cracks.
Does Lucie ever see things
that aren't there?
Things that may want to hurt her?
Hmm.
These are victims,
and like you or I,
they reach a breaking point.
Martyrs are so much more.
They're so very rare.
So extraordinary.
Martyrs survive the pain,
the torture,
like our Lucie,
and they refuse to die.
Martyrs endure
the unspeakable sins of the Earth,
and they give themselves up
and transcend
their very being.
You are fucking crazy.
And when the police come,
they're gonna--
Don't speak about things
that you can't possibly understand.
Longsheng Province, 1912.
This woman was accused
of stealing food,
and she was being punished.
This photograph was taken of her
when she was alive.
Look at the eyes.
Juliette Ducier, 1945.
She was a grocer
who slept with a German.
At the time, that didn't sit well
with the French,
and she had to pay.
Her eyes still alive.
Birmingham, 1960.
A woman in the final stages
of cancer
beyond the use of morphine.
She was pronounced dead
a dozen times.
And yet she refused to die.
Again, the eyes.
All of them photographed
when they were alive,
all of them seeing something
in their final breaths.
That's what we're recreating.
And we're so close.
That's our hope with Lucie.
And a few rare others.
No, no, no.
Don't feel badly for her, Anna.
- She welcomes this now.
- No, no. Don't do this!
Anna: No! No!
' Stop!
Stop it!
-
- Anna: No! No!
You have to look past
the pain, Anna.
- Past the human form.
- No.
To what's behind those eyes,
to what she sees.
- No!
- To that final place after life
that awaits us all.
That's what this is about?
Why you've been torturing
and killing people for years?
It isn't torture
when it's for a higher purpose.
We're developing their gift,
expanding their knowledge.
And these people
are here to see this?
They're looking for the answer
to the human race's greatest mystery.
We all are.
So you murder
for their entertainment?
I sacrifice for knowledge.
Why are you
showing me this?
I'd hoped to send you on your way
with some peace, Anna.
In appreciation
for your returning Lucie
to where she belonged.
Unfortunately,
I can't give you that, Anna.
No! N-no!
Bury her with the family.
And make the final preparations
for Lucie.
No.
Exactly as Dr. Patterson
would've done it.
Hey!
Stand up.
- Turn around.
-
Lucie?
Lucie?
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
I have to find my friend.
I'll come back for you.
Lucie?
Where is she?
Drop it.
Put it down.
Kill him!
Samantha: Anna!
Anna!
Anna!
-
- Anna!
I'm getting you out of here.
Ready?
I have to stay
and find my friend.
I need you to run, Sam,
as fast as you can.
Find a house, get someone
and tell them about this place.
Please.
It'll be okay.
You won't have to be scared,
not anymore, okay?
Go! Go! Go!
This is the one.
It has to be her.
It has to be.
-
-
Lucie.
Help.
Help!
Man: Oh, Lord, we rejoice
in the suffering of thy child.
Through her pain,
may we truly know
the mysteries that are yours.
- Through our--
-
Get away from her.
Take her down.
Lucie. Lucie.
Lucie.
Man: She's there.
She sees. I'm sure of it.
Take her down!
Lucie!
Lucie.
Man: She's there.
Take her down.
No. You could push her
past the point of endurance.
Take her down!
You'll let her die in vain.
Stay away from her!
All of her pain
will have been worth nothing.
She knows the answer
the rest of the world
has fought
countless battles over.
- Shut up!
- Destroyed civilizations.
Please don't waste her suffering!
Man: She's trying to speak.
Could you...
-
- Man: Can you hear what she's saying?
- Man #2: What is it?
- Man #3: Is she describing it?
- Man #4: I've got to find out.
- Woman: What did she see?
What did she say?
She was there, wasn't she?
I heard her.
Father!
What did she say?
She was there, wasn't she?
What did she say?
What was it?
What did she see?
You tell me.
I'm so sorry.
I wish I could ride a cloud.
Let it take me wherever I wanted.
Where would you want to go?
Wherever you go.
