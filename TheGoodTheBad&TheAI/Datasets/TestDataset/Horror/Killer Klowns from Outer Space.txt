Killer Klowns
Killer Klowns
from Outer Space
Little son of a bitch.
Cops.
This is Mooney calling.
Nothing yet, Dave...
...but Friday night's just started.
I'm getting started across down at the park.
Check in with you later.
Give me a cold one.
Fine.
Cool off those hot lips
with our tasty frozen fruity bars...
...icy whiteys..
Fudgy wudgy bars...
...and everyone's favorite frozen delight:
The licker stick!
- Jeez, what the...?
- Get outta here, you morons!
- Oh yeah?
So you don't want any ice cream?
Well, you're not gettin' any!
We were getting it
before you showed up.
Those guys...
What the hell are they doing here?
Great idea, Paul.
"Everybody loves ice cream. "
What do you mean? It was your idea. Hey.
Why don't we just park here for a while?
Hey... What are you
guys trying to pull here?
We... we thought we'd park here for a while.
You said we could have
all the ice cream we wanted
...but didn't say anything about parking.
What kind of girls you think we are?
- We want you to takes us home right now.
Take it easy...
Keep your shirt on.
Don't worry, we intend to.
Knuckleheads.
Did you know those guys?
These guys are my best friends from school.
Whenever I wanna have a good time,
I call Rich and Paul.
A night out with those types...
...is a total adventure.
What am I talking about
the Terenzio brothers for
I would much rather...
kissing you...
This is great.
Yeah.
Oh, check that out!
- Did you see that?
- Yes, I saw that.
That was incredible.
Did you see that little sky
zip down over there, Pooh?
It is Halley's comet
and it has landed in our backyard!
There's gonna be thousands of people!
Thousands of people will be comin.
They're gonna have hot dogs.
They're gonna have helicopters and airplanes...
...and tacos.
This is our lucky day!
We gonna be rich, Pooh.
We gonna be rich.
- Come on, let's go check it out.
- Oh, c'mon. No way.
It's a waste of time.
It's gotta be a thousand miles away.
Ruined our whole evening.
Don't give me that.
You saw how close it was.
It landed right over the hill.
That is not a thousand miles way.
Come on.
You can find it, Mr. Adventure.
Debbie, don't you want
to finsih the champagne?
Take it with us.
Come on.
Okay.
Pooh.
Come on.
Attention, dog. Come on.
I'll be greased and fried...
What in blue blazes is a circus doing out
in these parts?
I love the circus.
Come on. Maybe we can
get us some free passes.
Come on, Pooh.
I have never seen one that looked like this before.
I don't know, Pooh.
You know, there's something kind of peculiar round here.
Where is everybody?
There ain't nobody around.
Where is the damn ticket booth?
How are we supposed to get in
and see the show?
Pooh?
Pooh Bear?
Where is that dog?
Somethin' funny is happenin' round here.
What in tarnation's goin' on here?
Where is my dog?
Where is my Pooh Bear?
I'll tear this thing apart
with my bare hands!
This thing is wired.
Police station
Get in there!
What's going on, Curt?
Same old shit.
I got 'em boozin' it up in the park.
We were just walking through the park on
our way to the dorm. We had a bottle of wine.
It's a beautiful night. We were walking around.
We didn't do nothing.
- You guys go to the college, right?
- Yeah, right.
So why don't you just stay there
and do your drinking on the campus?
Why do you have to come into town?
Come on...
We live in this town, too.
I mean, we don't have to just stay on campus.
Yeah...
And it's scum like you
that is killing this town.
Come on, Curt!
Come on. Just take it easy!
What's the matter with you, Dave?
You got a thing for these little boys?
Empty your pockets!
- We just had a little wine. What's the problem?
- You're the problem, you little shit!
Just lighten up, Mooney.
Just lighten up.
Back off, Dave. Open container,
public intoxication, littering,
disturbing the peace,
resisting arrest...
These kids are history.
Unless you wanna rewrite the laws,
Mr. Police Academy.
Look, you got this problem with my training,
I don't care...
...but if you bring someone into this station,
I don't wanna see you beat 'em up.
Now if you're gonna fuck 'em,
do it according to procedure, or I swear, Kurt...
...you and that badge of yours will be history.
Tell you what's gonna be history -
These kids.
Now get them in there.
- Get in there!
- Shit.
It looks that we have to walk from here.
Let's see.
If instinct serve chief correct...
...path lie...
...that way.
We must travel many moons...
Many...
...many moons. Many...
Enough already with the moons.
Lead the way, Chief Running-At-The-Mouth.
Holy shit!
That's not a shooting star. It looks like a-
...circus tent.
What does a circus tent all the way out here?
Pretty bad location for a show.
Something is wrong. This doesn't feel right.
Well, weren't we looking for
the shooting star?
Come on, this looks neat.
Let's check this out.
No.
Let's go. I've seen enough.
Come on, Deb.
I want to take a closer look.
You can stay here.
Alone?
Would you be more scared if
you came with me...
...or if I left you here?
If you left me here. Let's go.
Come on. Come on.
Okay, okay. I'm coming.
Come on, let's check this out.
No, Mike.
We'd better not.
Deb, You'll gonna love this.
Don't be a baby.
This is bizarre.
What kind of circus is this?
It is that new wave European circus,
Hurry, hurry. Step right up.
Come one, come all.
Step right up, little lady.
Do not be shy. Do not be stupid.
Come see the incredible Miss 50-50...
...Half man, half woman...
The perfect double date.
Yes. That's my little lady.
Step right up here and see Gumbo,
the toothless elephant.
Or right over here, we've got Belinda,
the bulimic wonder.
Watch here binge and purge
before your very eyes.
Mike, keep it down.
Somebody'll catch us.
God, is this place great or what?
It looks as if it was decorated by
Clowns'R'Us.
I don't know.
So how much further do you want to go?
Let's go til the end of the aisle,
where these doors are.
Come on.
Woah!
This is not a fun house
Not a circus either.
What?
I don't believe this.
- What is it, a nuclear plant?
- No.
- A missile silo?
- No.
- A military base?
- No!
- The shooting star!
- What are you talking about?
The shooting star we went to look for,
we are in it.
What was that?
I don't know...
...but it's coming this way.
Here. Come on.
Look at this place.
It smells like candy.
You know, I do not know what
we saw out there before, but...
this looks like a cotton candy factory.
Yeah!
This must be where they hang them
to dry before they ship the stuff out.
No, it is not.
I've never seen anything
like this before, have you?
No.
Well that's because nobody has.
I do not believe in UFOs...
...but if they do exist,
then we are trapped in one right now.
Will you just calm down? There's gotta be
a logical explanation for this.
This isn't what you think it is.
Nobody stores cotton candy like this.
What are you talking about?
Of course it is.
Look.
Joe Lombardo!
This way!
- Are you OK?
- I think so.
Come on.
Popcorn? Why Popcorn?
Because they're clowns, that's why.
Mike, get me of here!
Hurry, they're coming!
We have to tell the police.
Oh yeah, we'll go right into the station
and tell them there's a bunch of clowns...
...running around in the hills and killing you
with cotton candy?
I have a friend there.
I know he'll believe us.
I do not know, Deb.
I wouldn't even believe us.
Crescent Cove - 5 miles
Come brother.
What the hell?
Dave! Oh my God!
Something horrible has happened!
- Somebody has been killed!
- Wait a second, Debbie. What happened?
You've gotta help us!
We've gotta do something! 2 people dead!
Who, Debbie, who's dead?
- Joe Lombardo. He's dead.
- And some old man, too.
Wait a second, guys.
Are you sure about this?
Yes, you idiot! They were hanging there wrapped
up in these cotton candy things...
...these... cocoons.
- Cocoons?
- Yes, cocoons.
- You know, cocoons.
- Alright everybody, calm down.
Look Debbie, come inside and explain this to me.
I'd like to help you, but before I can
I got to understand what's going on here myself.
Drugstore
- Good.
Okay? And then we'll go on.
Oh, look.
Cute.
Alright, sit down.
Let's start from the beginning.
...and then we saw that shooting star
and we decided to go look for it.
But instead of finding the shooting star,
we saw this circus tent.
And that's when we went inside and that is
where we saw those people...
...in those pink
cotton candy cocoons.
Dave, it was not a circus tent.
It was something else.
- What? What?
...and there were these things,
these- these killer clowns...
... and then they shot popcorn at us.
We barely escaped.
Killer clowns from outer space?
Holy shit.
Dave, we are telling you the truth.
You gotta believe us.
Let me tell you something, honey.
I was just over there.
There's nothing goin' on.
Excuse me please,
but we are talking to Dave.
Now just hold on a second, Mooney. They say that
some people are dead. Let's hear them out.
Alright, Dave...
Okay.
Clowns, cotton candy...
...flying popcorn.
Go ahead. Let us make fools
out of the police department.
I told you I was
just over there!
Are you gonna believe me or this little this little tramp?
Come on, Mooney!
I'm handling this, alright?
Alright, Debbie, who is your friend?
Mike. We go to school together.
You two were
Yeah.
I know you, you little fart.
You hang out with the Terenzi brothers.
Clowns? I get it.
Another one of their stupid stunts
...to sell ice cream from that goddamn
truck that hoodlums run around in.
Well, now I really believe this.
You better go now, Dave,
...before the clowns take over, huh?
And when you get back from savin' the world,
...I want a full written report so I can give
it to the chief when he comes back on Monday morning.
Look, everything happened
just the way we said.
We are telling you the truth!
Alright, alright.
You two come with me.
Come on.
Hurry up, Dave.
Don't let 'em get away...
Go ahead, Dave...
Make a dummy out of yourself!
But you're not making
a dummy out of me.
You, in the back.
Uh... oh!
Uh... excuse me...
Oh, my...
How can I help you?
Oh no!
Alright, I'm going up
there and check this out.
First I'm taking you home.
No way. I'm going up there with you.
You can't tell me what to do.
Debbie, just listen to me, will you?
I don't have to listen to you.
You're not my boyfriend any more, alright?
That's true.
I'm not your boyfriend any more.
That doesn't change
the way I feel for you, Debbie
Dave, please.
Don't do this to me.
Alright Debbie, you got a choice.
You either go home or I take you back to
the station and lock you up for safety.
How's that?
Pizza.
Oh...
- Pizza.
- Uh-huh.
Oh?
For me?
Aww Jim,
is this from you?
Look, Debbie...
May I please speak to Mike outside?
Right. Sure.
Thank you.
- Your old boyfriend? This is great.
- You come here?
Probably taking me on top
of the hill and shoot me.
Well, don't worry about Dave.
It's those clowns
who gotta worry about.
Listen, as soon as you guys leave here,
I'm gonna follow you up there.
You're gonna follow us up there?
Debbie, I don't even wanna go up there!
Listen, you stay inside the house
and keep the door locked.
I'll be back in a little bit and chipper.
Okay?
You better.
It's good timing.
Wait a minute.
Where is it?
- Yeah, that's what I'd like to know.
- It was right there where that hole is.
So you're saying the
hole is where the tent was?
The tent made that hole?
Yes! It was there.
Look, we saw it. That's a fact.
I tell you what the facts are, mister!
You said people are being killed.
Now, where are the bodies?
I don't know! I saw Joe Lombardo dead.
I can only tell you what I think I saw.
No, I know what I saw! I just can't prove it.
My proof is gone.
Yeah right. Turn around.
Mooney was right, got nothing
better to do but causing problems.
- You'll not gonna get away with it this time.
- Away with what? Debbie saw it too.
Yes, she did, didn't she?
- Ow!
- Come on.
- Eddie, is that a new bike you got?
Wooh!
Big Bad Jojo comin' into town.
- Watch this, babe.
- Is that bike too big for you?
Patty!
- Mean bike you got there.
- Yeah.
Can I take a ride?
Pal?
Aww, you can't take a ride...
Can I beep the horn?
Oh, thank you!
He should've let the man ride his bike.
I'm sorry.
I seem to have broken your bike.
Where did he go?
Badaboo. Badaboo!
What are you gonna do,
knock my block off?
Damn!
Come on, let's get out of here!
- Come on, guys!
- Get out of here!
Here is more ketchup
for your french fries.
No here is more ketchup. I want
you to sit still and eat your hamburger.
You know, this isn't as
much fun as it used to be.
It is if you're the winners.
Back here, young lady.
You're not going anywhere 'till you've finished your food.
What's going on?
Alright, get out.
Turn around.
What are you doing, man?
You're not gonna hit me, are you?
Just turn around, pal.
Alright.
- Look, I'm sorry about Debbie, I didn't know...
- Just drop it, Mike!
Check this out.
That's the stuff!
That's the stuff I told you about
that was wrapped all around Lombardo.
- Where did you get that?
- In that jeep over there.
That's McReed's jeep.
- Who's McReed?
- Bob McReed.
He was up here
tonight with me and Debbie.
Those are his glasses.
They got him. He's dead.
Crescent Cove Police Station,
Mooney speaking.
Wait a minute. Calm down,
I can't understand you.
- What?
Clowns, huh, and now
they're at your front door.
- Wait. Who is this?
Stupid kids and their pranks...
Rich little bastards.
They shoot 'em all.
Daddy sends them to fancy schools...
...so the police department
can babysit them. Pricks.
Police Station. Mooney speaking. Yup.
Hello, Curt?
I think I have a bit of a problem here.
Wait a moment.
This is not you too, Mr. Myers.
Police Station. Mooney here.
What?
- They took your wife away in a balloon?
Well, you don't need the police.
You need a psychiatrist!
Mr. Myers?
The Terenzi brothers
and the whole town are in on this?
Well, to hell with 'em all.
If you want to play games...
...you're messing with the wrong guy.
Jesus! No!
Oh no! Come on, Joe, get going!
God!
Woaaaah!
Aahh!
I'll call the state police up
in Marlborough. They got a lab.
Maybe somebody up there can
tell us what this stuff this.
It is not cotton candy, that's for sure.
Yes. Finally.
That's what I've been telling you.
Look, I'm sorry I've
been a little tough on you back there.
It's been a hard night.
Having Debbie involved
just makes it a lot more difficult.
What can I say? I didn't know...
It has nothing to do with you,
really. It's me.
Obviously she goes for laughs,
not stability.
Ahh! Oh!
Boo!
Oh my God.
That's funny.
Oh! Ah!
Just drop me off here.
I'll take the bus home.
No way.
You are the one who has seen these things.
Look! A clown! Right there!
There he is, I told you.
You get out there and shoot him?
- Get him, Dave!
- Mike, just hang on.
Calm down. Let me check this out.
- Holy shit!
- I don't believe it.
- Dave, run him down!
- Mike, let go! Mike!
What are you doing buddy?
Sorry. I freaked out a little bit.
Where is he?
I don't know.
I don't see him anywhere.
He's gone.
He went straight up.
I've seen enough.
One Baker five.
Curt, do you read me? Over.
One Baker five.
This is Mooney speaking.
I was a little worried about you.
I thought the big bad
clowns got a hold of you. Over.
Mooney, I want you to listen to me
and don't say anything.
I want you to call
the state police and get help.
There are clowns
and they are killing people. Over.
Okay, let me get this straight.
You say there are clowns
and you've seen them.
Okay, Dave, that's it. Screw you and
your college friends.
I've had enough from you
and from everybody else.
I know what you guys are trying to do:
Break me down, drive me out of the force.
Well, it's gonna take a hell
of a lot more than a lame prank like this...
to get Curtis Mooney to throw in his badge.
So fuck you! Over.
- Aww shit!
- Mooney, this is an emergency. Mooney!
He cut me off.
That son of a bitch cut me off!
I gotta- I gotta get back to the station.
I don't know what I gotta say,
but I have to get through to state police.
- Get the truck!
- And the girls?
Forget about the girls.
They eat too much.
- It is our ice cream!
- So what? The truck's getting away!
Those aren't killer clowns,
those are theTerenzi brothers.
The Terenzi brothers?
Get back to the station, radio for help. I'll
catch up with my friends and warn them.
Alright, tell everyone to stay indoors
and don't do anything stupid.
You too.
- Oh, shit.
- Don't yell at me. You were driving.
- So now it's my fault?
- This whole ice cream thing was your idea.
- My idea? You said we would have girls this way.
No I didn't. You did.
- You did.
- You did.
Hey Rich! Paul!
Oh man, am I glad to see you guys.
Mike, how're you doin'?
You want some ice cream? We got-
No man, listen. Something horrible's happened.
I need your help.
- What are you talking about?
- What's wrong?
There is no time to explain.
There's clowns goin' around killing people.
Uh-huh.
Tonight, Debbie and I were up
...and we found this spaceship
and we saw these...
clowns and they were carrying these...
cotton candy cocoons...
and they were shooting these..
these... popcorn guns.
There is a circus tent-spaceship, right?
But it's not there any more but we were
there and we saw the whole thing.
And they say we're crazy.
So?
Oh come on, you guys.
I am not foolin' around!
Mike, what do you want us to do?
We have ice cream to sell tonight.
Paul, this is more important
than selling ice cream.
There's clowns goin' around killing people.
We're all in danger.
Well, we have not sold
much ice cream tonight.
- We haven't sold any.
- Come on, guys, will you help me?
At least take me over to Debbie, okay?
I think she is in danger.
Does she have any roommates?
Yes, she's got two.
She's got two beautiful roommates.
...with big boobs.
Do they like ice cream?
They love it.
What are we waiting for?
Come on!
Let me through.
Let's get away.
Freak yourself
You ain't gonna get the best of me.
I made it through Korea,
I can make it through this bullshit.
Woop-dee-goddamn-dee-doo!
What do we have here?
Well son, I think you made a big mistake.
You're in Mooney territory now.
For me?
I ought to shoot you right now,
you red nosed freak.
So you wanna play games, eh?
Turn around!
Alright...
I am supposed to read you your rights...
...but you're in Mooney's jail...
...and you ain't got no rights.
Alright, buster.
God.
Hey Officer Mooney,
c'mon, let us outta here!
- Are we gonna be here all night or what?
- Yeah, we want our phone call.
- Right. I wanna call my...
- Shut up!
Get your hands up.
Get in there.
I don't know who you are...
...but before this night's over...
...you're gonna be begging for mercy.
What are you in for?
Mooney!
Police Department. Hello?
Mooney? Mooney, you back here?
God.
Hey Dave...
Who was the girl
who I saw you with last night?
Do not worry, Dave.
All we wanna do is kill you.
Marlborough state police.
Jack, we need your assistance.
The town's gotten crazy.
People are getting killed. Over.
These clowns aren't people.
They are some kind of creature,
things from another planet.
Look Jack, they're killing people.
Officer Mooney is dead.
I know. I saw. He was killed
by one of these things.
Could you send all
available units immediately please? Over.
Come on, Jack!
Debbie.
Guys, could you stop fooling around?
Look, Mike, come on.
cocoons, popcorn guns,
monster shadows... woo-hoo.
- What do you think we are?
- We're not as stupid as we look.
This isn't the first wild thing you've
tried to pull over on us.
- Look, you remember Hidden Lake?
- Uh-huh.
Oh c'mon, forget Hidden Lake.
This has nothing to dowith Hidden Lake.
We would have to be total morons
to believe this clown invasion crap.
If there are killer clowns
runnin' around here,
...then I'm Porky Pig.
Loading zone
We gotta get the hell outta here!
Eww!
- Mike?
Debbie...
Debbie...
Okay, see this
white house right over here?
Take a right... I mean, left. Left.
- Left?
- Right.
- Right.
- No, left!
The house's right up.. uh...
Shit. What is that?
Wow... Look at that.
Mike!
Woah!
Come on! We can't lose her!
They got Debbie!
Hey, Mike!
C'mon Rich, we're losing it.
Can't you go a little bitfaster?
Come on, Mike, what do you want?
This is an ice cream truck.
Hey Rich, the cops!
Stop the truck!
Woah...
Shit, Rich, now you did it.
I did it?! What do you mean?
You told me to stop.
Didn't I tell you to pull over?
No you didn't.
You said "stop", so I stopped.
Well, I meant "pull over".
If you meant "pull over"
you should've said "pull over".
Why don't you say
what you mean next time?
Come on, let's see what happened.
Dave, are you OK?
God. Oh fuck...
What the hell are you guys doing?
They got Debbie.
Get in the truck now.
Gee, officer, I am really sorry.
I was feelin' a little queasy...
You might wanna tell me
where they're headed.
They went that way, but we're lost.
I don't know where they went.
I do. If you were a clown,
where would you hide?
The amusement park!
- Great!
- Alright!
The park is closed.
I'll have to ask you to leave.
What are you gonna do
with these pies, boys?
Hey!
Heyheyheyhey!
Everybody stick together.
She's gone.
Wow...
Hey you guys, this is weird.
- Look at this stuff.
- Looks like a wad of melted ice cream.
- Yes, but it's not.
- Oh shit.
Yeah.
Come on.
- Hey.
- Sorry
Mike, you take this. Follow me.
Alright, you guys, no fooling around.
Stick together, okay?
What the hell is in here?
Ooooooo-hooooo. Scary.
- Dave, did you call for help?
- Yes, it's on its way.
You told them this is an invasion?
I told them,
but I don't even believe it myself.
Where did they come from?
Why are they here? Why clowns?
They are not clowns.
They are some kind of animals
from another world that look like clowns.
Shit, Dave.
Dave, maybe from the ancient astronauts
who came to earth centuries ago...
...and our idea of clowns
just comes from them.
How come they are not funny?
Maybe they're from a dying planet.
Maybe their sun pooped up
and they need a new place to live.
Maybe they need us for experiments,
for dissection and study.
That means they're intelligent
So why don't they communicate with us?
I mean, talk to us
instead of killing us?
Maybe they're just cruisin' through
the galaxy and stopped here for a bite to eat.
Yeah. Look, everybody,
let's just holf off from the talking, okay?
Let's not give ourselves away.
What are we gonna do when we find them?
Can we kill them?
Yeah.
You shoot them in the nose.
Hey, watch this.
Cool.
Weeew!
- What happened?
- What did you do?
I didn't do anything...
Well, don't touch anything, okay?
This place is probably booby-trapped.
Alright. Now look you guys, stay together.
I don't wanna run around and find you too.
No problem. We can handle it.
Yeah...
Woah!
Alright, let's go.
Where did they go?
Come on, Rich, Paul.
Don't worry about the Terenzi brothers.
They do this all the time.
Those guys are like cats.
They always land on their feet.
Weew...
Are you Debbie's roommates?
Wait a second.
I recognize this place.
This is the tent where
Debbie and I were in. Come on!
Go Mike.
Okay, this is where we were before.
Wow, this is incredible.
Looks like they got the whole town.
We got to find her.
What kind of balloon was she in?
Uh... yellow.
Alright.
- Do you see anything, Mike?
- I don't.
Impossible, Mike.
Shh. Quiet.
Move back.
Ah...
Paul was right, man. They are hungry.
They're gonna eat everybody!
Calm down! Just calm down, alright?
We gotta find Debbie
before it's too late. Alright.
Hey. That's the one.
The yellow balloon. Is she in there?
- Yes, she's in there!
- Debbie!
- She's alive.
- Thank God.
- How the we get her out of here?
- I don't know.
- Careful, Mike.
- Damnit!

But I saw you guys get
blown up in the ice cream truck.
Oh, that. We hid in the freezer
with the ice cream.

Don't blame me. It was your idea.
No, it wasn't.
You were the one who said we could get girls.
You said we could.
Hey listen, if it wasn't for me,
you'd be a dead french frie.
Yes, you would be a dead pasta.
Do you think it's over?
