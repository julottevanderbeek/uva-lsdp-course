Dead Calm  - 25 fps
- Merry Christmas, Captain Ingram.
- Merry Christmas, Evans.
The police told you about the child?
Yes, they did.
I'm very sorry, but we'll need
a formal identification.
Yes, of course.
I have to warn you...
...most of the injuries were to the face,
I'm afraid.
The police said...
...that my son died on impact.
Is that correct?
Not quite.
Just after the ambulance arrived.
- How long was that?
- He was unconscious.
He wasn't aware of any pain.
How long, Doctor?
Twenty minutes.
- Have you ordered x-rays?
- They're on their way.
She'll need an urgent CT scan.
Decerebrate response?
It's her husband.
I want you to talk to her.
Rae, it's John.
Try it again.
Rae, it's me.
It's John, Rae.
"Down came the rain
And washed poor Wincy out
"Out came the sunshine
"And dried up all the rain
"And Incy-Wincy spider
"Crawled up the spout again"
That's a funny one.
Will you try it with Mummy now?
No.
Come on.
"Incy-Wincy spider
"Crawled up the water...
"Spout!
"Down came the rain
"And washed poor Wincy out
- "Out came the sunshine"
- He fell down!
"And dried up all the rain"
- Danny, darling, get back in your seat.
- I've got him.
I saved him.
No!
No!
It's okay. It's all right.
I was holding him!
I know, I know.
John, I could smell his head.
Stop it, Rae. Stop it.
No, I can't!
I'm so scared.
I'm so scared.
He's gone. He's gone, baby.
We can never get him back.
It's gonna take a long time.
Now, you know that. They warned us.
Let's go home.
- Please?
- It'll be worse there.
- I don't think I can get rid of it.
- Yes, you can.
No, I can't.
Don't say that.
Now look.
We've got weeks and weeks.
Calm days, calm seas.
Now, we're gonna get strong.
And when you're strong...
...then we'll go home and we'll start again.
Won't we, Rae?
Say it, Rae. Won't we?
Say it, Rae. Won't we?
What's wrong, Ben?
Come on, mate.
What was it?
It's nothing. Just the dawn.
Is there any wind?
Not a whisper.
So...
...what day is it today?
Thursday or Friday.
One of those days with an "R" in it.
Look at that.
First boat in three weeks.
She's been through some weather,
that's for sure.
Is there anybody on deck?
Not that I can see.
I'll call them up.
Do you have to?
I like it like this.
Just the two of us.
So do I.
But look at her, Rae.
That boat's in trouble.
Black schooner to my east.
This is yacht Saracen, Victor Kilo 2-7-6-2.
Position 16-16 south, 176-47 west.
Do you read me? Over.
John!
John!
I thought I saw something
between here and the boat.
What is it? A turtle?
No. It's bigger.
- You see anything?
- Not yet. Hold on.
There it is.
It's a dinghy.
Adrift?
No, there's a man in it.
Save it! We'll drop down to you!
You hear me? Ship your oars!
Get the fender, darling.
Stand off!
Take it easy.
Get him some water, darling.
Not too much.
- Here you are.
- Thanks.
My name is Hughie Warriner.
John Ingram. My wife, Rae.
I'm 32 days outward bound from Papeete.
I'm heading for Fiji.
I only bought her about three months ago.
My plan had been to cruise around
the Pacific, to sail around the Pacific.
Who would have thought, right?
What's your trouble?
Trouble is she's going down,
that's the trouble.
She's not gonna last the morning.
Are you sure?
Yeah, she opened up all over.
Has the water hit your engine?
My engine...
...the radio, the fucking bulkhead, galleys.
Everything.
My only chance was to try to reach you
in the dinghy.
See what Mr. Warriner needs, darling,
and get him to bed.
All right.
Where are you going?
Well, I ought to get over there.
How many people onboard?
Nobody. I'm alone. I'm it.
You tried to take her across the Pacific
on your own?
No.
There were six of us.
The others died 10 days ago.
One by one.
It all happened in a day.
What happened?
Have you ever thought about how life
can hinge on the smallest thing?
I mean, ever since I was a kid,
I thought salmon was for cats.
Was it canned salmon?
Yeah.
At first we thought
it was the tourist trots...
...until Chantal looked at her hand
and said...
...Picasso should have painted it.
It had seven fingers.
Double vision, huh?
Sounds like botulism.
What's that?
It's a lethal form of food poisoning.
It hits the nervous system.
Yeah, well, I tried everything.
There's no treatment.
Not on a small boat there's not.
Not 1,200 miles from land.
When you're ready, Mr. Warriner.
We better go and salvage your gear.
My gear? You're looking at it.
There's nothing to salvage.
Everything was ruined by the water.
There must be something.
Give me a break.
I mean, you know what I had to do?
I can guess.
They've been dead for days!
You know what that does to a body?
You've gotta try and stop thinking about it.
I mean, I...
Fuck, I can't go back. All right?
I can't go back there right now.
Ever.
That's all right. I understand.
Why don't you go to bed
and get as much sleep as you can?
Thank you.
Look, I'm really sorry to ruin your day.
- Here?
- Yeah, straight ahead.
You all right?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
You sure?
Some interesting stuff here.
Listen to this.
"South Sea Island Cruise. Four young
women wanted for photo assignment.
"Must be attractive and broad-minded."
You don't like him, do you?
I hadn't thought about it.
John, imagine what he's been through.
I'm sorry, Rae, whichever way I turn it...
...I just can't swallow it.
Any reason?
Not really. Just 25 years at sea.
I'm going onboard her.
You can't do that.
He's fast asleep. He won't even know.
He will. He'll hear the engine.
No, he won't. I'll take the dinghy.
Load the gun and keep it with you.
Are you serious?
Just do as I say, please.
Back soon.
'Bye.
Wait a sec.
Go on, take it.
One, two...
Okay.
Go!
Bring it back. Come on.
Rae!
Rae, I'm sick! I got to use the bathroom!
Rae, I'm nauseated! Please!
I don't want to throw up in here!
Rae!
Jump, Rae! Jump!
Jump!
No! What are you doing?
No!
Jump, Rae! Jump!
Get off, Rae!
Leave it!
Ben.
Where's John?
Now, what?
John, my husband.
Where is he?
He's gone.
What have you done to him?
Nothing.
He went onboard her.
We've gotta go back.
He's only got himself to blame, right?
I mean, he should've trusted me.
But that's always been my problem.
- Don't you understand?
- Please don't shout.
That's always been one of my problems.
I can never tell people's motives
until it's too late.
Let's just turn the boat around.
Where shall we go?
- Turn around!
- Look, you're being very aggressive.
That could be a problem on this small boat.
I've seen it happen before. It doesn't work.
I was watching you
when you were sleeping.
And I gotta tell you
that your face fascinates me.
Even when you're 80, Rae,
you'll still be a beautiful woman.
I studied art...
...for a time.
I found that painters,
when they approach their subjects...
...they always look at the face from behind.
From the back, to see what's holding it up.
And you've got magnificent bone structure.
"Magnificent."
Shit, that sounds like something...
...you'd say at a cocktail party.
Should have given you my card.
I just knew we'd get along, didn't you?
What's wrong?
Would you just tell me one thing?
Sure.
I just need to know if that boat is sinking.
Sinking?
Well, past tense would do.
But, yeah. Yes, it is.
Why? Don't you believe me?
Yeah, I believe you. Of course I do.
- That's why we've gotta go back.
- Back?
- To get John.
- You mean, back there?
Right now.
No, Rae, no. Okay? That's over.
That's over. So let's erase that one
from memory and start again.
There's no going back!
No, don't say that.
He's gonna drown!
There you go! You're ruining it again.
That boat is sinking!
That's not my fault!
What about those people?
There wasn't any food poisoning,
was there?
You want to do this now?
All right.
They tried to kill me, Rae.
They tried to suck the light out of me,
if you can grasp that concept.
Who were?
All of them!
Nobody wants to kill you...
What?
Repeat that.
- I said, nobody...
- Say the words. Come on!
You mean I just imagined it.
No.
I just meant it must be a mistake.
A mistake? Lady...
The mistake is that you think
I'm making this up!
No, I don't.
You sound so much like them it's scary!
Now, they were trying to kill me.
Do you understand?
Yeah, I understand.
Turn around. Don't look
at the bloody boat. Look at me!
Okay, I'm sorry.
What are you doing, Hughie? Go away!
- Okay, ladies, forget the home movie.
- Listen, ifyou turn around...
...you'll get these incredible silhouettes.
When I want your advice on how
to take photographs, I'll ask you.
Until then, keep your mouth shut!
I'll remember that, but for now,
Russell, please.
Lfyou move two steps to your left,
I can get you with the boat.
We'll look at this someday and laugh.
For God's sake, Hughie!
Get that bloody camera offme!
I take the pictures, Hughie, baby.
You dance, I shoot.
What the fuck is your problem?
This is stereo, Ben.
Low production...
...garage music.
Come on.
Saracen, Saracen, this is Orpheus.
Do you read me? Over.
Saracen, this is...
John?
Yes!
John?
Are you okay?
Are you there?
Yes, Rae, I'm here. Can you hear me?
Are you there?
Rae, it's me.
I'm not reading you.
Is that you, John?
Are you hurt?
What about the boat? It's sinking, isn't it?
So that's it.
No, you're not hurt and, no,
the boat isn't sinking. Is that right?
Are you following?
What should I do?
I can't make him turn around.
Hejust won't.
Do you want me to stop the boat?
I don't know how.
Come on.
Don't worry. I'll work it out.
You'll be here soon, won't you?
Score one for Mrs. Ingram.
She has a hell of a season ahead of her.
Ben, no!
Leave it!
Leave it there.
Fetch, Ben. Bring it here, boy.
- Bring it here.
- Stay, Ben.
- Come on.
- Tread right there.
Okay, drop it. Drop the key.
Hold the key.
- No, drop it!
- Keep it.
Over here. Come on.
Tread.
Backstroke.
Come on.
That's beautiful bone structure there.
Good boy! He's a champ, this one.
Jump, Ben. Up. Come on, climb.
Thank you.
Friends?
Friends.
- Talk to me, Russell.
- Come on. The camera's rolling.
Lose that! Talk to me, Russell.
Who are you?
Come on, drop the veil.
Drop the veil, sucker! Drop your guts!
I got the picture.
Vietnam, Castro, Cambodia!
Russell Bellows,
big, brave war photographer.
The man on the edge
capturing the face of death.
But now appearing
with his five new refugees.
Five suckers on a sinking boat.
The ultimate session.
Moral decay. What 60-minute wet dreams
are made of. Am I right?
Come on in, Russ. The water's great.
You got the bloated head.
How about the bloated belly?
Come out from behind that camera.
John, can you hear me?
Saracen to the black schooner.
Come in, please.
Come in, please.
John, it's me.
I got the key up onto the deck, but he...
What's wrong? Are you hurt?
Is it the boat?
Is it sinking?
How long?
Hours?
How many? Two?
Four?
Six?
I drained you ofyour power, Russell!
You've lost.
Good night! Good night!
Six?
I'm gonna be there by sunset.
I love you.
Answer me, please. Answer me.
Do you read me?
John, please.
I've just gotta go to the bathroom.
Sorry.
You gotta do what you gotta do.
Hello?
- For later.
- You read my mind.
Friends, Rae.
- I better put him up on the deck.
- Don't worry. Get out!
- I better put him up...
- Come on!
Go away.
Where are you going?
To get a drink.
Isn't this great?
- What?
- These lemons, they're just...
Cruising around the South Pacific,
just the two of us.
How do I look?
- Great.
- How do I smell?
Thank you for your honesty.
What's missing from my life at
this moment are the soothing sounds of...
...Julio Iglesias, Joni Mitchell
and the Broadway Album.
Did you get these tapes thrown in free
with the knives?
He finds it!
That looks good.
It is.
Do you want some?
Come on.
You do. Come on, have it.
Now, look...
Do you want it?
I want it.
Thank you.
I better go and get dressed.
Keep it. Make me another one.
Room service.
A squall's coming.
We better get the canopy down.
Oh, shit.
Friends, Rae.
Friends!
Don't make me.
No one's gonna make you.
Stay there!
I just want to talk!
I found you.
Fresh water.
That's extravagant.
No, you want to hear extravagant?
A steaming hot bath...
...that you can slip into up to your ears...
...with coffee and a croissant.
A croissant.
Covered...
...in bitter, dark marmalade.
And mango.
Really, really cold.
Now you're talking.
You know what I'd love for lunch?
Fresh asparagus.
Then pasta.
Angel-hair pasta.
With heaps of basil and garlic and olive oil.
And apple pie.
Have you got the towel?
