Take aim.
Fire!
Unprecedented,
historic casualties.
More Americans died in
the so-called Civil War...
than in the two
World Wars combined.
Although popular media usually
portrays the Civil War...
as a series of epic battles
for honor and glory...
the reality is far from either.
General Sherman's march
through South Carolina alone...
cost over 8,000 innocent
Southerners their lives.
Sparing no women or children...
Sherman reduced the city
of Columbia to ashes overnight.
While you're on spring break
next week down in Florida...
you might better understand
why so many Southerners...
still are angry at the North...
and their rampage of
death and destruction.
I get it.
Their fashion might be
a little bit out of date.
Rest assured
one day in the future...
your grandkids will be
laughing at photos of you.
Shit.
All right, all right,
settle down.
One of the big problems
for the Southerners...
Fucking piece of shit!
God damn it!
Nelson!
It's jammed, sir.
What's going on?
Oh, God.
Have a nice break.
See you in two weeks.
You, you, you... stay!
It's about respect,
gentlemen.
Respect for me...
respect for
the subject matter...
but, most of all,
respect for yourselves.
Papers like this...
"General Sherman:
A Total Badass"...
ain't going to cut it.
Your antics today
clearly demonstrated...
how serious you are
about your studies.
You, Anderson,
you missed class yesterday.
Actually,
I didn't miss it at all.
You think
this is very funny, eh?
This university
won't miss any of you...
next semester
when you're expelled.
That is, unless
you all turn in...
three new term papers...
by, let's say,
the end of spring break.
Let me remind you
of an old saying...
Those who don't
learn from history...
are doomed to repeat it.
Gentlemen,
the party's over.
Vilano Beach,
Palm Beach, Palm Coast.
Daytona!
Aw, shut the fuck up.
How much farther are we?
I don't know.
It's not even that bad.
Daytona is
another eight hours.
It's in Florida.
It's heavy-duty.
Dump the fuckin' map.
I'll find us a shortcut.
Dude, this is so nice, man.
Why do we even
want to go to Florida?
We should just
stay right here.
Have you guys taken a moment
to look around you?
Look at this place!
Oh, yeah.
It's fuckin' awesome.
I love the smell
of cow shit in the morning.
Take it all in, boys.
Sniff it.
All right, all right,
all right.
I know what I'm gonna
write my term paper on.
"Cow Shit of the South:
The Smell of Victory."
Dudes!
The whole point was getting away
from history class.
Fuck!
What the fuck is this?!
Who is this guy?
What the fuck?
That was my armadillo.
We've been tracking that
all day.
You totally wasted it.
L... I'm sorry, man.
I didn't see it.
It was like it fell out
of the sky, dude, I swear.
Tell you what.
Lf, you know, if you give...
me and Dr. Mambo
here a lift...
you know, we'll
totally call it even.
Dr. Mambo?
Where you guys heading?
South.
Daytona Beach.
Awesome!
Awesome! Let me
get my pack, dude.
Yeah, hop in, man.
Go.
Face!
The way I see it...
if we drive
through the night...
we'll be quaffing beers
by noon...
and boffing chicks
by 5:00.
And pushin' up
daisies by midnight.
Go, banjo boy, go!
Holy...
fucking...
shit.
Oh, God, man. I could
drink her bath water.
Dude, I'd eat the peanuts
out of her shit.
She's not your type, dog.
Trust me.
Dude, if she has a pulse,
she's my type.
Watch and learn.
Hey, man.
What's up, dude?
Not much. Just going on
a road trip with the ladies.
Where are you guys heading?
Daytona Beach.
My brother's
got a beach house.
On the beach.
Yeah. Must be fate.
Must be.
We're headed there mañana.
Cool.
Well, I was thinking that...
We should all hook up
when you guys hit town.
You got a number, hon?
You wouldn't happen
to have a pen or paper?
Who needs paper?
You know what, ma'am?
I couldn't agree
with you more.
So, what's
your name, cowboy?
Anderson.
Whenever you're finished,
you can come up for air...
Anderson.
What is your name?
Oh, I'll tell you...
if I call.
Later, boys.
On the beach.
Was that a score?
I can't really say.
She'll call.
She wants the house.
OK. We're in
"Deliverance" country now.
So, unless
you're into squealing...
like Porky Pig's
love bitch, Nelson...
we need a shortcut.
You guys
have no faith, man.
Let's go.
Nice overalls, dude.
Pushin' up daisies
by midnight.
Yep, we're lost.
Great.
Anderson, you got the map?
Of course you don't.
It's in the trunk.
Trunk? Yeah.
Way to stay up
with me, guys.
I got to do
all the driving while they...
It's midnight, boy.
Man, shut up!
Hey, hey, hey.
It's just a dream.
Dream, whatever.
Where the fuck are we?
You took a shortcut,
didn't you, Nelson?
Look. I tried to wake you
two douche bags, all right?
This is your fault, too,
kind of.
Our fault?
Yeah. I mean, no.
Guys, look, sign, all right?
Detour sign.
Enough. Get out
of the front seat.
Come on. Get out. Get out.
I'm driving.
That's it. That's it.
Later! Shit!
Wait up!
Ass munches.
- Get him.
- Ow! Hey!
I can't reach him.
Ow! You cinched my sack.
Ow, bitch!
I just want
to go to the beach!
This isn't
a real detour.
Where the hell are we?
Check it out.
Looks like it's abandoned.
What the hell is that?
This place
is like a ghost town.
Welcome
to Pleasant Valley.
Well, don't be
a wet ding dong, fellas.
Buckman's the name.
Mayor's my game.
Now, why don't y'all here
give us a big howdy do, hmm?
Anderson Lee.
Nice to meet you, sir.
Uh, my two partners here
go by...
Lee? Lee. Anderson Lee.
My, my, my,
what a beautiful surname you...
Y'all ain't from
the South, now, are you?
Born and raised, sir.
Lived in South Carolina
till freshman year.
Then you crossed over
to the other side, I see.
Well, well, we might
just save you yet.
You see, y'all arrived...
just in time to be
our honored guests...
at the Guts 'n' Glory
Jubilee.
Dude, I say we get
the hell out of Dodge.
Like, my brother's
waiting on us, bro.
Well, good morning,
Miss Peaches.
If I supply the peaches...
do you think you boys
could supply the cream?
We're staying.
At least for five minutes.
Well, looky here.
Appears we got more guests
fresh on the way.
What?
Pussy wagon's here.
Well, don't that beat all?
You all the prettiest
damn Yanks I ever seen.
Jesus Christ, it's Toon Town.
Toony Town?
Son, this is Pleasant Valley.
And for the next two days...
it's gonna be nothing
but dancing and games.
And best of all...
a mouth-watering...
mmm, mmm... barbecue.
Let me guess.
Detour sign?
Detour sign.
What do you think?
I'm game for anything.
Tell you what.
You stay, we'll stay.
Cool.
Judas Priest.
We got ourselves
two more Yanks for the jubilee.
What the hell
kind of detour was that?
Negro and Chinaman
to boot.
That's Chinawoman.
And what a woman!
Well, don't just
stand around, folks.
Granny's got rooms
waiting on you at the hotel.
Come on!
Come on!
Welcome to
Granny Boone's hotel.
'Sup?
I don't think so, Amos.
- I'm Hester.
- And I'm Glendora.
Granny Boone said we're supposed
to show you to your rooms.
You girls want
to burn some blunts?
You know, spleef?
Reefer.
You two are so lucky
you're hotties.
Any more luggage, boy?
Boy?
Ain't y'all motherfuckers
ever heard...
of the Civil Rights Movement?
Is that anything
like a bowel movement?
What, are you out
of your fuckin' mind?
Kick back, hon.
Granny Boone done wash out
some fresh sheets for ya.
Guess you people aren't wearing
those things any more, huh?
Tell me, where do black folks
hang out around here?
From off that tree
down there yonder, usually.
Oh, you want
to get down, huh? All right.
Chill, baby.
I don't think our bellhick...
is playing
with a full deck here.
Granny Boone say we got to
please all our festival guests.
Even you.
Well, we wouldn't wanna...
piss old Granny Boone off,
now, would we?
All right then,
that's more like it.
Now, remember...
dinner is
at seven P.M. Sharp.
And Granny Boone,
she hates tardiness.
Well, then y'all
best leave us to prepare.
OK, then.
I bid you adieu.
That's German
for I'll see you later.
Shit we got to go through
for a free meal.
Come on, Malcolm.
A little old-fashioned
hospitality might be fun.
Fuck old-fashioned
hospitality.
I'd rather fuck you.
Oh, shit.
This sure is a fine reenactment
setup they've got going here.
I ever tell you how much I love
Civil War tourist attractions?
Don't y'all mind us none.
Jezebel!
Come here,
you little mutton chops.
I say to hell with Daytona.
I, sir, am in accordance.
You know, I never knew
you were Southern.
I was raised
by my Aunt Charlotte.
She was old-school Southern.
She taught me to open
the door for the ladies...
say, "Yes, ma'am"
"Why, no, ma'am."
You sure unlearned
that shit fast.
Right, Cory.
It's still in me
in the background.
School's in session!
My misguided spawn.
Now, why in the hell
did you let them two devils
in Pleasant Valley, hmm?
Lord knows I don't cotton
to waiting on a darky...
and... however,
in service to the festival...
Mmm, well,
it'll all be over soon.
Looks like Miss Peaches...
done snagged herself
a Yankee boy already.
I got my eye
on that purty one
with them long legs leading
up to them tender buttocks.
Now, now, now.
You leave her
to Harper, boy.
That tasty dish
don't stand a chance...
once he walk up on her.
Am I right
or am I right?
Trouble
Trouble
Came a-knockin'
Came a-knockin'
Trouble
Trouble
Came a-knockin'
Came a-knockin'
Trouble
Is this place a hoot
or what?
Can you believe
these hicks actually think...
we're gonna sleep
in separate beds?
Well, I say we hang,
grab whatever we can...
and blow.
The whole town
or just those frat boys?
Don't worry, Ricky,
I'll save one for you.
What about
saving one for me?
Now, which one
would that be...
perhaps Mr. "I'll stay
if you stay"?
To our door
Hey, handsome.
Hello, everybody.
On behalf of
our little town...
I'm here to welcome y'all...
and invite you to taking in
some of our sites.
I'll wrestle you for him.
What's that?
Nothing.
Just ignore him.
Dang, Jethro.
You got
some muscles there.
It's Harper, ma'am.
Harper Alexander.
I'm Kat...
as in pussy.
This is Joey,
this is Ricky.
Perhaps if Miss Pussycat
is willing...
the sun
sure looks mighty nice...
reflecting on the lake
right about now.
Miss Pussycat
is more than willing.
Well, then,
I guess I'll be seeing...
you other fine folks
at the festival.
If you will.
Wait, Kat.
It's my good-luck
dog tag.
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.
Is there anything
you wouldn't do?
Later, kitty cat.
Welcome, welcome.
Don't tell me.
You must be Miss Boone.
It's a real pleasure
to meet you, ma'am.
Oh, Miss Boone, from
the bottom of our hearts...
we thank you
for such fine accommodations.
Oh, don't make me blush.
And that's Granny
to you, sonny boy.
Y'all like my ladies?
Yes, ma'am.
Y'all ready
for a good ole time?
Yes, ma'am.
So...
Gosh dang it.
Kitty's getting away.
Come here,
you stupid cat.
Get over here.
Why don't you gentlemen
give him a hand?
All right.
See you soon, boys.
Is this some hillbilly
reality show type of thing?
You know this is Georgia,
Miss Pussycat.
Harper, try just
calling me Kat.
Miss Pussy
sounds so formal.
Well, Kat...
how could one not but smile
whilst in the company...
of such a beautiful Northern
sophisticrat like yourself.
You're either the most
romantic guy I've ever met...
or you're completely
full of shit.
- Come here.
- Get back here, kitty.
I ain't gonna hurt ya.
Come on, guys.
Come here, kitty.
My daddy proposed to my mama
right here on this spot.
My daddy proposed to my mom
in the back of a '69 chevy.
Course that was
before the troubles.
Before all that fire done
burnt this spot to the ground.
Feels like a fire
right now.
You know, life always finds
a way of pushing itself...
up through death, Miss Kat.
Feels like
something else is trying...
to push its way
through now, baby.
You like horses?
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Come here,
kitty, kitty, kitty.
Come on. Come on,
you little cat.
Once again, Anderson Lee
showing how to get pussy.
Thanks, mister.
Name's Hucklebilly.
Hey, what's up,
Huckleberry?
It's Hucklebilly,
dumb ass.
Damn. Feisty little fella.
Y'all wanna play
a little game with me?
I don't know, Hucklebilly.
We got some ladies
waiting for us...
if you know what I mean.
Yeah. Heck with it, then.
Oh, come on.
The little kid
has no one to play with.
Poor little circus clown.
How about that roll in the hay
you were talking about?
Make me scream
that rebel yell.
Well, that, ma'am,
I can guarantee.
You just lay
right here, OK?
I didn't know
my Southern gentleman
had a touch of kink
in him.
If a kink means
a hunger for you, ma'am...
then that he does.
Hey, look, dude.
We're sorry.
Leave me alone.
Hey, we'll play a game
with you, all right?
What do you got in mind?
It's called
Kill the Kitty.
- Shit.
- See, kitty's been bad.
Real bad.
I'm gonna lynch her.
And y'all
can be the witnesses!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
All right.
What would
your mother think...
if you hurt
that poor little kitty?
My mama?
Mister, my mama give me
a silver dollar...
for every broke-neck pussy
I bring home.
Harper, honey...
this isn't exactly
what I had in mind.
Well, Miss Pussy,
it's exactly what I had in mind.
Now, I know you city folk
think us country boys naive...
in the ways of love...
but we ain't as innocent
as you might think.
I mean...
I think this might be taking it
just a little too far.
Frankly, Miss Pussy,
I don't give a damn.
Yee-haw!
Ow.
I know it's not etiquette...
to eat without
everyone present...
but a little birdie
advised me...
that perky friend of yours
is gonna be a little bit tardy.
So let us pray.
Dear Lord...
we thank you for the food
we are about to eat...
that makes us whole
in mind, body, and soul.
Amen.
Dig in.
I'm so hungry
I could eat an entire goat...
and not share
a single hoof.
Disgusting.
Huckleberry's
got the munchies.
It's Hucklebilly,
pig breath.
Can't you Northern folks
get nothing right?
Miss Boone...
Excuse me, Granny.
You've simply
outdone yourself.
Thank you.
Hear, hear.
Sure looks tasty. Mmm.
Speaking of tasty...
it appears that, uh,
our Harper Alexander...
has done gone and swept
your Miss Kitty Cat here...
off her feet.
Lucky bitch.
Guest or no guest...
I will not tolerate
swearing at my table.
Just ignore him.
Jealousy always gets
in the way of his manners.
Jealousy?
Kat always bags
the fine guys first.
Just once I wish
she was the one eating...
sloppy seconds.
May I offer you some
fresh milk with your pie?
I... l... I think...
I think you just did.
I'll keep my jug handy.
Holy mother of God.
Is this seat taken, miss?
What if I said it was?
Well, I guess
I'd have to tell you...
what a mistake
you've made...
and what an opportunity
you've missed.
I guess I couldn't
give you these.
How... romantic.
You ever hear of
a sixty-second romance?
Got a minute?
I got all night.
You listen up careful now.
Harper done did his duty
for the festival
with that Yankee filly.
Time's now come
for you two to do yours.
That's a mighty big noose
you got there for a cat.
Who says
it's for a cat, jug head?
Why, if you even think
of hurting Jezebel...
Shut your mouth now,
Lester.
Leave that boy alone.
Been meaning to talk
to you about Jezebel.
Is, uh, this mutton chop
at least a girlie?
She's a woman
to you, Daddy.
Now, if y'all excuse us...
come on, baby.
Now, Daddy. Daddy,
don't mind Lester none.
I got full confidence
in him.
Son, one time I had
full confidence in a fart.
Shit all over myself.
Hey, perv.
Hey, chick with milk jugs
walk by?
She was headed
toward the cow pasture...
crying your name.
When you're finished
with your boyfriend...
you know where to find me.
What?
Gentlemen...
I believe it is time
for another toast.
Hit me, bartender.
To the ties
that bind...
friendship...
and in this case...
the fine folks
of Pleasant Valley!
Three queens.
What?
Nothing.
Bitch.
I feel like we're in
a Confederate frat party.
You know what I always say?
The only difference between
a frat boy and a gay boy...
is a six-pack of beer.
You know it's true.
Hmm.
And, uh, remind Lester...
that he has to cornhole
that sissy boy.
I know... I know it goes
against the good Lord.
I'll do it, Daddy!
That's nothing to get
excited about, Rufus.
God damn it.
Come on, Rufus,
put your weight into it.
That's right, girl.
Get him, Pretty Ricky.
Oh! Miss Angry.
You got angry muscles.
Big-ass muscles.
Come on.
Not you.
See ya, dude.
Come on, Rick.
God damn.
Winner does the pitching,
loser does the catching.
Ah, screw that.
Even you're
gonna get laid?
That's right.
Don't whack it too hard.
Come on, girl.
God.
And to all, a good night.
Uh-uh. Not yet, boy.
Oh, take it off.
Take it all off.
Get away.
This what you wanted?
Nelson!
Oh, Nelson!
Surprise!
Holy shit.
Oh, my God. I've been thinking
about you all night.
You gonna invite me in...
or just stand there
polishing your musket?
Damn right
I'm gonna invite you in.
Peek-a-boo.
Whoa.
That was fast.
Hey, nice to see ya.
Got milk?
Milk?
So, wanna get to know
each other a little bit maybe?
Maybe even tell me your name.
Nope.
Oh, yeah.
Oh... oh, my God.
You know, uh, my mom
never had to say to me...
"Drink your milk, poopy."
Poopy?
My mom
used to call me poopy.
Long story.
Very long.
Honey, do you
want to talk...
or have
a little fun?
Have some fun.
That's what I thought.
What the hell is that?
Is that a milk bong?
Silly boy.
This is special moonshine
I made just for you.
You gonna suck it?
Look, moonshine
is not really my thing.
I'm more into beer
and... and things like that.
Are you a boy or a man?
A man, God damn it.
Suck it, mister man.
I prefer a nonsmoker.
The South's
gonna rise again
The South's
gonna rise again
Hey, Opie man.
I'll give you a dollar
if you can get Z.Z. Top...
to play some Hendrix.
So, how'd it go?
Well, it was
extraordinary.
Yeah, we talked
till 3:00.
Mind sex, bro.
Mind sex?
Miss Ricky
don't mind sex, does she?
No, she doesn't.
Looks like Cupid's arrow
hit somebody...
in the ass
last night.
Wasn't my ass
that got hit.
I was the one
shooting the arrows.
Well, buttermilk pancakes.
If it ain't
our honored guests...
just in time to inaugurate
the grandest jubilee ever!
Well, shoot dang,
Mayor Bumpkin.
If this ain't
the bestest festival ever.
Hee-haw.
I would not besmirch...
the sincerity and efforts
of our proud little town here...
if I were you, sir.
A great price has been paid
to ensure the success...
of this festival.
Whoa. Excuse me, sir.
We're...
we're just a little
hungover, you know...
hair of the dog.
Apology accepted,
Mr. Lee.
Well, guess we're staying.
Guess so.
Hey, anybody seen Kat?
Anybody seen Nelson?
Ten to one
he's hitting it.
What did you do
to Miss Kitty Cat?
Well, I didn't get to do
anything with her, mister.
Like he said, that big rough
and tumble Connecticut boy
done stoled her from me.
Nelson?
- And Kat?
- Sure enough.
I was doing my best
to court her properly.
That boy cut right in.
All right, y'all.
Quit your dilly-dallying.
Boys with the boys...
and ladies with the ladies.
Well, now...
let's all get
this party started.
Yee-haw
You ever seen
a kissing meadow?
Hell no.
You want to see one?
Hell yeah.
Oh, man.
When in Rome.
Come on, China girl.
Let's get you
all cleaned up.
Ole Granny Boone
done cooked up...
one hell of a roast
with this one here.
Yes, sir.
Granny Boone gonna have her
hands full for the festival.
Can't wait to taste
the rest of her at the barbecue.
You know,
like I always say...
two heads
are better than one.
What's the deal with
these people, anyway, huh?
It's like
a damn time tunnel.
Oh, come on.
Just admit it.
You guys aren't
used to old-fashioned...
unspoiled Southern manners.
Hey, I'm digging it.
This place is a trip.
Sure is.
After you done turned
a curious country boy...
against all
that's right and decent.
He wasn't bad
for a beginner.
Oh, shit.
You ever taken
a turn at the shoes?
Not since I was a kid.
That's the thing, friend.
You need to get better practice
at the manly arts...
hunting and soldiering
and whatnot.
That has what
to do with horseshoes?
Horseshoes is
a military game in origin.
Goes back to French trappers'
method of gapping mink...
as they called it.
She's just playing hard to get.
Jezebel!
Now, the good Lord
has blessed each one of us...
with distinct virtues.
And it is our responsibility
as ladies...
to figure out what they are
and how to use them.
I got the gift of tongues.
I got it
from my step-pappy...
the Reverend Jonas.
Bet the reverend's
a very proud man.
He is.
I hope you all will allow us
to share our ways.
You were shy and rough...
but under them
Northern exteriors...
I think y'all gonna
clean up real good.
Rubba dub dub.
Who wants me
in their tub?
Nobody.
And get some pants...
on that little
ding dong of yours.
Shoot, Granny.
Today's my turn
in the barrel.
My, oh, my.
Here we are.
Place where
I got my first kiss.
Me, too.
Of course, you, too.
You're the one
who kissed me.
You are
my first cousin.
Who else
was gonna do it?
Whoa. Wait a sec.
- You're cousins?
- Mm-hmm.
Cool.
I thought
you'd never ask.
The napkin.
You can watch
from over there...
if you're quiet.
Fuck, yeah.
You, sir, are a pig!
What?
A pig.
You're boning your cousin
and I'm the pig?
Go away, boy.
But you said
I could watch.
But you weren't quiet.
So...
What exactly
do we do here?
Gap, gentleman.
Refer to the part of the mink
that's not there after the toss.
Most usually the head.
Fuck.
Whatever, dude.
'Scuse me.
Let me get
that shot there, playboy.
Hold my beer there, Rufie.
Watch the style.
Shit!
Fuck y'all.
Philly ain't exactly, uh...
horse country.
The dog is in the house.
Hey, lucky.
Why don't you try
your luck at this.
Maybe it will work
out better for you.
Hell is that?
That's a mink
or something.
Go on, gap it.
Gap it!
Son of a bitch!
You must've
gotten some.
Done real good.
Ooh, my, my, my.
So very pretty.
Don't you make a heavenly
Southern belle.
Miss Joey, you're gonna be
the next one to steal my heart.
Um, I don't think so.
Think role-playing, babe.
I know my man is gonna want
to hit this when he sees it.
Now you're talking
like a real Southern lady.
Well, gosh darn it, heck.
Ain't you the prettiest
little thing I ever saw?
Easy, Cinderella.
Well, if that ain't the pot
calling the kettle black.
By the way, Joey, your...
little boy Anderson
is looking for you.
Thank God.
Saved by the bell.
Leah.
Ladies, have fun.
Don't you pay her
no mind.
Later, Rick.
Let the hoedown begin.
Whoo-hoo!
Grab your partner
and give her a whirl
Whoo, yeah!
Now twinkle your hair
and give it a twirl
Whoo-hoo!
Slap your backside,
lift your arms
All right!
'Cause the cows and the chickens
is returning to the barn
Little china doll,
ain't you sweet
Whoo, yeah!
I reckon you'll make
a tasty treat
Now dance right up
to the podium of honor
Oh, yeah!
And let's bestow
the honor upon her
Yee-hoo!
- Golden china girl
- What?
Cute butt
Whoo-hoo!
Perky little breasts, yeah
Ooh, I want one
Time has come to do
what's right
- Right!
- Right!
'Ccause we've only begun
to renew the fight
Ooh, yeah!
To avenge the horror
that occurred in this place
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!
- It's your maker, now, bitch...
- Huh?
You'll have to face.
That Chinawoman...
had a lot of guts.
Need a hand?
Joey.
Now, where do you think
you're going?
Where'd you get that?
Your friend
gave it to me.
But Ricky gave that to Kat
for good luck.
Uh-huh. Be that as it may,
it's mine now.
Sorry.
That must be a mistake.
Give it back to me.
I'll give it to Kat.
We're getting ready to go.
Oh, you're not leaving.
No, Peaches.
We are.
Good luck.
Back up off me.
You got it.
You right on time.
Well, well...
I see the festivities
are in full swing.
Are we enjoying
ourselves yet, ladies?
Your son fucking loved it.
Uh-uh, the girl's
having so much fun...
he can't stand it.
He squealed like a pig.
See our barb-a-cuties?
Skewering rod
raring to go.
Well, are we ready?
I said, are we ready?
One, two, three.
Ramming speed!
Looky-loo.
It's Ricky on a sticky.
I love my meat
pink in the middle.
Take him to
the slaughter house, boys.
Good job, gals.
They were actually licking pie
off each other's tits.
I-it was so wrong, bro,
but so right.
Southern style.
Corndog, you have done it.
You are the man.
The man?
After taking 20 years
to get your first piece of ass?
Whatever.
Think this is
all fun and games?
Look around you.
This place is fucked.
I mean, you don't get
something for nothing.
When was the last time
you been somewhere...
where there's
no electricity...
water... cable...
hot black bitches?
Malcolm's right.
This place is fucked.
I just ran
into Miss Peaches.
She was wearing
Kat's dog tag.
Said she gave it to her.
Kat would never
give this away.
And she wouldn't
stay gone this long...
without coming back
to check in.
It's not like Nelson vanished
with all this free beer around.
Wait a minute. You went off
with Leah, right?
Well, where is she now?
Square dancing and
guest starring on "Hee Haw."
Look, bottom line...
this is all bullshit.
I'm tired of being
the guest of honor.
She's right.
I say we watch
each other's backs.
We're in this
together, right?
You got it, bro.
We tight
till we all hit the road.
Good.
I'll go check out
the ride situation.
Malcolm,
you go find Leah.
You two head back
to the hotels.
Get whatever stuff
they haven't ripped off.
Now everybody act like
this is all great here, OK?
We fucking love it.
Nobody let on
that we're gonna bail.
- Uh-huh.
- Heard that.
Miss Peaches says
y'all might be inclining...
to leave town.
Is that so?
Uh-oh.
Y'all don't
want us thinking...
that you're insulting
our heritage, now, do you?
Of course not.
We're thrilled to be here.
Yeah. That's right.
So, you guys
just excuse us.
Shit.
Sweet blade, ain't it?
Mmm.
Pretty piece of steel.
Now...
I'm only gonna say it
one time.
This is the most important
day of the year...
for the good citizens
of Pleasant Valley.
So, y'all don't want
to disappoint my kinfolk.
Trust me on that.
Yeah, we don't take
too well to rejection.
We've been known to react
harshly to them that crosses us.
I guess you're right,
Mr. Mayor.
I guess we shouldn't
be so fast to...
leave your fine festival.
Well...
that's right polite,
Mr. Lee.
Right polite.
So, y'all best be,
uh, going, huh?
You don't want
to miss the barbecue.
What do you think
happened to Nelson?
Nothing happened
to Nelson.
There's a simple explanation
for all of this.
Don't worry, bro.
I always said the South
ain't changed a damn.
Leah'd get mad at me
for saying that.
You know,
Kat, Ricky, and me.
We've done some pretty
freaky things in the past...
but nothing beats this.
All for a free meal.
Ain't this a bitch?
Pleasant Valley.
Hmm. More like
Death Valley.
OK, kids.
One hour. We'll regroup
at the hotel.
Well, all righty, then.
I'll be seeing y'all
at the barbecue tonight.
Don't be late.
Like he said, baby...
don't be late.
Later, bro.
Folks.
I'd like to propose a toast.
To us.
Survivors in
a spiritual sense...
of the worst atrocity
of our times.
A war between the states.
I know you fine people
of Pleasant Valley...
have suffered
more than seems possible.
But one day... one day
we will find rest...
we will find peace...
we will...
we will be avenged.
And I tell you now...
each and every one of
you sad, searching souls,
as God is my witness...
we will never...
never go hungry again.
Hey, precious.
What you doing there?
What the hell... Aw, shit.
They all nasty.
He's got our stuff.
Heads up.
Remind me to thank you later.
At the beach house?
On the beach.
So I left my cell phone
in my room.
Maybe they
haven't found it yet.
Go for it.
I'll stand guard.
Ricky.
Where you going, man?
Yo. Ricky.
Not this shit again.
There are lessons
in this world
Some are easy
Some are hard
To swallow, that is
Fuck this.
I don't even like
crackers in my soup.
Ah, the guest of honor.
We ain't expecting you till later.
Oh.
You wouldn't happen
to see where...
my friend went
through here, did you?
No, I ain't seen
nobody come through here.
You see anyone
come through here?
No, sir. Ain't seen nobody
come through here, sir.
Nobody except us mice.
It ain't polite to go sneaking
'round a kitchen before dinner.
Even if you is
the guest of honor.
I'm sorry.
I was just going to get
my best suit in my car.
I would hate to show up
at the festival underdressed.
You wouldn't know where
the cars are parked, would you?
Oh, oh.
They parked them things...
out by the barn.
Ain't that right?
Oh, yes, sir.
Your car, sir,
is parked right down yonder...
by that there barn.
Well, thank you kindly,
gentlemen.
I'll be seeing y'all
at the barbecue.
Oh, we'll be seeing you,
all right.
There once was a lassie
Slant-eyed, kind of sassy
Airs and conceit
Till Granny she did meet
Shut up!
Now, listen...
Tired of this shit.
Either one of you
inbred country fucks...
knows where
my woman is...
better tell me now.
The boy wants his bitch
Yeah, the boy wants his bitch
Sad, sad thing
A boy without his bitch
Well, it's about time, Leah.
Talk about a sight
for sore eyes.
Hey, babe,
where you going?
I don't get it. Hold on!
Hey, Leah!
Baby! Hold up!
Oh, my God. No.
Look what...
Come on!
Cory.
Mmm. You looking for this?
Well, here you go.
OK, you win.
Time to go home. Come on.
What the fuck?
What kind of people are you?
Now, now, now, wait
a cotton-picking minute here.
We thought you...
y'all liked games.
Games?
What kind of motherfucking
game is this?
You Northerners
may be used...
to uptight ladies
like Miss Joey.
One country fuck, and all those
city girls will seem like...
nothing more than
a hole in your mattress.
What are you doing, huh?
Putting in
your retainer, baby?
You could call it that.
Help!
What the fuck?
Well.
Let's see, now. We...
we done took him in...
clothed you, fed you...
give you a place to call home...
and what'd you do
to repay our gratitude, hmm?
You done run away.
Motherfuckers!
Need to wake up and
smell the 21st Century!
Seems we have
to impress upon him...
some good manners!
Got any last requests, boy?
Kiss my black ass.
Next year,
no more last requests.
Well, ding-dang-do.
I believe you're trying to steal
that colored boy's bike.
Oh, I wasn't stealing, buddy.
I was just borrowing it.
What are you doing
with the keys to that bad boy?
Well, I reckon to take
a little ride myself.
Granny done said I can't...
on account I gotta guard
the barn all day.
Dumb old ugly bitch.
So, uh, what do you say,
you and l...
We go for a ride.
We'll find my buddies.
We'll play Kill the Kitty.
You mean it?
Sure, just toss me the keys
and we'll be on our way.
Shoot.
If I go for a ride with you...
how in the heck am I
supposed to guard the barn?
Well, I won't tell Granny
if you won't.
What do you say?
I say shoot, doggie.
Huh?
Ring the dinner bell.
It's killing time.
You really don't think
I'm that much of a moron, do you?
Well, well.
Just in time
for our grand finale.
Year after year after year...
it all comes down to this.
Don't it, Granny?
That it does, Bucky.
Too bad his little friends
couldn't make it.
Well, that's a matter of opinion.
Ain't it just like
you Northern folk...
thinking you can waltz
in here and bring us low.
There ain't gonna be no escaping
what y'all got coming to you.
So...
who is going
to speak our gratitude?
Our grace for
what sustains us? Hmm?
My sweet Hucklebilly...
will you do the honor?
To our guests from the North...
spread here at our feet...
thanks for being such tasty meat!
The South's going to rise again
The South's going to rise again
Now, you two
gonna be impressed...
when you see the barbecue
Granny's done cooked up for you.
Missy,
bet you can't eat just one.
Now, y'all like
dark meat, hmm?
Now, you might
be surprised...
but I have always been
partial to Chinese.
Only problem is...
hour later, I'm still hungry!
The South will rise
The South will rise
The South is gonna
rise again
The South will rise
The South will rise
The South is gonna
rise again
The South will rise!
The South will rise!
The South will rise!
The South will rise!
The South is gonna rise again!
The South will rise!
The South will rise!
The South is gonna rise again!
We was gonna
go easy on you, boy!
Being you was a fellow reb...
once, at least.
But then little missy
done went and turned you.
Now, being that
I'm a Southern gentleman...
I'm gonna offer you
a second chance.
All you got to do
is gut the whore!
Well, what's it gonna be, boy?
What's it gonna be, son?
No time like the present.
Here you go.
It's just like guttin'
a possum, honey.
Welcome back, son.
To the glory...
And the honor.
Kill her. Kill her...
I'll take
your glory and honor.
And I'll shove it
right up your ass.
You OK?
Fuck those maniacs!
Guess that means yes.
Go get that Yankee traitor!
Where the fuck
did she come from?
You'll never kill me again.
They're everywhere!
I thought we'd found a way
to put yourself up to death.
Think nothing right?
Vengeance is mine,
sayeth the Lord.
Down into the fiery pits
of hell with you.
It burns. Burn, thy sins
and the sins of thy father.
No, they did this!
Bring back my baby!
Y'all stand back.
They're mine now.
Yee-haw!
Let me go!
This ain't my first barbecue, son!
And it surely won't be my last.
Duel of honor.
Man to man.
Yee-haw!
Anderson!
Please, son!
L... I beg of you!
N-not my good eye!
I'll do it. I swear I'll do it.
You'll be whistling "Dixie"
out of your eye socket...
unless you let us go.
Oh, we'll let you go!
I swear it!
W-word of honor!
Word of honor?
Southerner to Southerner.
Gentleman to gentleman.
Word of honor.
Let 'em go. Both of 'em.
Set 'em free.
Come on, boy. Take a ride.
Only one way out, Mr. Lee.
Right this way!
Are you with me?
All the way.
Charge!
An eye for an eye.
Hey, hey, hey!
What's your problem, boy,
charging in like that?
Look, you gotta help us.
I know it's crazy, OK...
but the people
at Pleasant Valley...
they put this detour sign
in the road...
they killed our friends.
They barbecued them
and fucking ate our friends.
What in God's name
are you talking about?
And then they...
and then they started
killing us, one by one.
Pleasant Valley, you say?
Yeah. Yeah, you know
Pleasant Valley, right?
Yeah, I know it, all right.
Everything OK?
I think you and me
need to take a little ride.
Ought to lock you both up
for wasting my precious time.
This here's your Pleasant Valley.
Ain't nothing but a graveyard
been here for the last 150 years.
No. There was a town here.
Full of people.
- We saw them.
- Lf I had a dollar...
for every drunken college kid come
hollering about flesh-eating ghouls...
I could have retired years...
No, you're full of shit!
- Hey! Hey!
- All right, all right,
Stop, stop, stop.
We're sorry.
It was... it was a joke.
Right?
I guess the poor souls
of these fine people...
who died at the hands
of you Northern heathens...
ain't so partial to your joke.
It's called respect, son.
"To 2,001 innocent Confederate
citizens of Pleasant Valley...
"laid to waste on this very spot
by renegade Yanks...
"in the War
Between the States.
"An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.
"Never will they rest until,
one for one, they are avenged."
It's dated April 22.
That's today.
But they're all dead.
Fuck you, Pleasant Valley.
Eye for an eye, Mr. Lee.
Eye for an eye.
Damn Yankees.
