When did you say that?
It was the voice of a man.
I do not think it will be much longer now.
Where is it that you think I meant?
I was speaking about the other night.
I do not know where Jack is.
I was near the harbor after it happened.
It was raining.
It is 8:35 PM.
Who was on the phone?
It is still raining.
It has always been like that.
When did you go out?
I have known since I was seven.
It happens all the time.
There is no moon tonight.
I said it looks like it is still raining.
Where was it exactly, do you remember?
Is it that late?
Since then?
And getting darker.
