Hyah!
?Rollin', rollin', rollin'?
Hyah!
?Rollin', rollin', rollin'?
Keep movin', movin', movin'?
Though they're disapprovin'?
Keep them dogies movin'?
Rawhide?
Don't try to understand 'em?
Just rope 'em, throw,
and brand 'em?
Soon we'll be livin'
high and wide?
My heart's calculatin'?
My true love will be waitin'?
Be waitin'
at the end of my ride?
Move 'em on, head 'em up,
head 'em up, move 'em on?
Move 'em on, head 'em up,
rawhide?
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in,
ride 'em in, let 'em out?
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in?
Rawhide...?
?Rollin', rollin', rollin'?
?Rollin', rollin', rollin'...?
Hyah!
Hyah!
Rawhide...!?
Hyah!
It's not the roundin' up,
and the ropin',
and the brandin' of the cattle
that's the big problem
for the ranchers.
It's gettin' them to market.
from the southern tip of Texas
to the railhead at Sedalia.
That's where I come in.
Gil Favor's my name...
trail boss.
You are the only one I know
can make
a chow bell whisper.
Now, don't
play it so dainty!
Put some muscle
into it!
Chow!
Now, don't
crowd up here.
There's plenty
for everybody.
How do you always manage
to be the first one
in the chow line?
Well, that's
easy, Wishbone.
All right,
next man.
Aw, come on, now.
Hurry up.
When have I ever
let you go hungry?
There's plenty
for everybody.
Now move along.
You can come back
for seconds.
If that herd stays
fit as it is now,
we'd be in clover
the rest of the way.
Look.
What in the
world...?
What is it?
A tumbleweed wagon.
It's a prison.
On wheels.
Anybody with half
a head could see that.
You ain't gonna let 'em
stop here, Mr. Favor?
It's open country.
Yeah, we better
double guard
the outfit.
Never heard of a man
in handcuffs
lookin' to run off
with cattle.
Take more than chains
to make me feel
safe in my sleep.
Whoa.
You mind if we share
the water?
Nobody owns it.
My name's Favor-
Trail Boss.
Will Jackson,
U.S. Marshal.
My deputy, Art Gray.
Art.
They sure ain't hangin'
the latch string up.
Some of the boys
are a little skittish.
Can't understand
what makes people nervous
around murderers, deserters,
and rustlers.
Me- I just keep
this arsenal as a hobby.
Tell your boys
to eat easy.
We'll camp yonder.
This is the last night
they're going to
pen us up like hogs.
I counted ten trail herders
out there
that I could see.
I dare say all of them
can use a gun pretty well.
So?
So, you're not running
this thing.
I suggest that we wait
for a more secluded
opportunity.
Secluded opportunity?
You'll be gettin' on
my nerves with that
foreign accent of yours.
I just want
to make sure
you don't get us all...
Aw, shut up.
Tie the horses.
Outside, guys.
Let's go.
Come on, son-
over there.
Get outside.
Come on.
Over here, man.
Let's go.
Move along.
Right over
here. Come on.
Come on out,
Dallas.
Oh, mama, tell me-
how do I get
throwed in jail?
Well, she ain't been
in that wagon very long.
Takin' up for
collections- bail
the little lady out.
Who's with me?
That's enough.
You whistle at
the herd a bit.
You bring in
the remuda.
The rest of you
are hungry.
Yeah.
All right, in line.
Hey, wait a minute!
Is that how
you treat a woman?
Woman?
She's more wildcat
than woman.
I don't need
your help.
Go ahead.
Be a big man.
She needs chains
more than any of 'em.
I just ain't got the heart
to handcuff a woman,
but it's more
than necessary.
I had my way,
they'd never get
out of that wagon.
They'd stay there
and choke
on their own foul air.
Who is she?
Married to Luke Storm.
You must've heard
of him.
That's just poor judgment,
not a crime.
Except that she's
part and parcel
of his gang
of cutthroats-
she and those other two.
My chow line's
all set up.
My pleasure
to send some over.
No, it's best they have
their chores to do.
Thanks anyway.
Go ahead, Art.
You and Virgo
unhitch the wagon.
Now, look here, I...
I don't want none
of your lip.
Bunker Hill's still eatin'
your dirty red neck.
We won that battle,
remember?
And we won the war,
remember?
Go on, both of you.
We've been on the road
with that human dynamite
four days.
We cover
a 300-square-mile area.
We pick up freight
from ten jails.
Seems it's be simpler
for the judge to travel
rather than the
other way around.
Not enough judges.
Too many jails.
Not enough unbiased juries.
Now, don't be
too hard on Art.
It's edgy work.
It does seem
to be that.
We make our move
tonight.
How?
We got an ace.
Wouldn't it be better to wait
until Luke catches up
and sets us loose?
Luke ain't gonna catch up
with us this trip.
Number one, suppose
he don't come back from Mexico
when he was supposed to?
Number two,
this lawman
ain't takin' us
to the judge at Mammoth.
He switched his route.
Now, there is a judge
at Fort Gregg.
I figure
he's headed there.
You have to palaver
to unload blankets?
Dallas...
...you got any objections
to seein' that
deputy go under?
No objections.
Yeah, this sure reminds
me of home, Norm.
The short-grass country
of the Mississippi Valley.
Yep. There, the water
makes you thirsty,
the squirrels live
underground,
and the spiders got fur.
Yeah, I sure miss it.
There's something
downright attractive
about the plain cussedness
of nature.
The plain cussedness
of nature.
Is that why you
sold whiskey
to Indians
on government
land, Matt?
To improve on the
cussedness of nature?
To improve on the state
of my pocketbook, Marshall.
You know, I ain't given
to worry much,
but this boy, here...
Well, he'll be safe
in government prison
for a spell.
Out of pure patriotism,
this lad left his home in
Philadelphia to join the army.
He's scared to
death of horses,
so naturally, they put
him in the cavalry.
Now, he begged- he begged-
to be moved
to the foot soldiers.
But oh, no.
That'd make
too much sense.
So, he deserted.
Now, is it fair
to put him in prison?
Well, that... that ain't
for me to say, Matt.
Oh, I wasn't scared
of horses.
It was the first sergeant.
He thought
I was scared of horses
because I didn't know
how to shoe them.
So, he got on me,
and he kept on me...
till I took him apart.
Bad apart, with my bare hands.
After that,
it was either him or me,
and I knew
he could have me hanged.
So, here I am.
You put him in
with hardened criminals,
and that's the way he'll end up.
Like that fish-blooded
Englishman over there
that killed his own wife.
Well, you act
the boy's lawyer, Matt,
and maybe the judge'll
see it your way.
And so, Virgo,
due to an accident of birth,
you see me in chains
in this American wilderness
instead of in
my ancestral castle in England.
Simply because
my twin brother was born
and gives me an allowance
to stay out of England.
I don't know
why you waste
your breath, Sinclair.
He don't understand
a word you're saying.
I've got to talk
to someone.
And, uh, he doesn't talk back.
You see, Virgo, I understand
why tribal custom demanded
that you kill that brave
who disgraced your sister.
It's theAmericans
who are the real barbarians.
I give you my word
as an Englishman
that somehow I'll...
I'll strike off your bonds.
Come and get it!
Come and get it!
They're all bedded down
and contented, boss.
Good.
You restless?
Huh?
Oh, uh... I just thought
I'd take a little walk
before I turned in.
Better walk
in the other direction.
You never saw
a woman in troubleyet
you haven't fallen for.
Look, Mr. Favor...
after dark, when I'm
not on night herd,
my time's my own, huh?
Mixing with
the tumbleweed wagon
is mighty touchy,
but I'm not telling you,
just asking.
Do you think the drovers
will try to stop us?
We don't
bother them.
Why should they
bother us?
Out of the way, Dallas.
Art!
Still hands off?
The horses!
I'll get her.
Let go of me!
I'd be obliged if you'd secure
that chain for me.
There's a padlock
at the end there.
I didn't want
to get involved.
They always say
the same words.
The men who killed my father,
they said the same thing.
They didn't want
to get involved.
Sorry.
Oh, they
were, too.
Vigilantes.
Especially when they found out
they'd hanged an innocent man.
They were sorry.
But my father was dead.
They had to pin
it on somebody.
They didn't know
he was going blind.
He couldn't even see anybody,
let alone shoot them.
And the people
in town-
the decent folk-
all they wanted to do
was just-just forget
that it ever happened.
Well, I didn'tletthem forget.
There were a lot of empty places
at supper tables in that town
before I was through.
Mr. Favor?
Deputy's dead.
Marshall ain't
got far to go.
His bleeding stopped?
Yeah.
You've got to...
you've got to get my prisoners
to Fort Gregg.
I'm sorry,
Marshall.
I got a herd
to deliver.
There's nobody else, Mr. Favor.
I got to get to a doctor.
You know it.
There's a doctor at Gregg.
You got no choice.
Oh...
You've got a choice.
To stay alive.
The man who rode out of here
is on his way
to Luke Storm, my husband.
He's likely
on our trail already.
All right, Marshall.
I'll get your wagon
to Fort Gregg.
Be smart, trail boss.
Walk away with your cattle.
Oh, I almost forgot
to thank you, Dallas,
for your prayer
over the grave.
I didn't realize you had so
much... religious training.
Enough to know
that them who pray the loudest
are the biggest hypocrites.
That's true, too.
You'll never get us
to Fort Gregg.
Who knows?
Herd's inclined
to move, Mr. Favor.
All right.
Take care
of his horse, Quince.
I'll be taking
the prison wagon
into Fort Gregg.
Well, you can't do it alone.
Yeah, I'll need
a hand.
I wouldn't mind seeing
Fort Gregg.
Sorry.
You've got the herd.
Rowdy, you want
to see a fort?
I sure do.
You'll need eyes
in the back
of your head.
Boy, I got 'em.
Undo the chain,
get the prisoners
in the wagon.
Right.
Figure two,
maybe three days to Gregg.
We'll catch up with you
at Prescott Crossing.
Get the Marshall set.
Please get
in the wagon, ma'am.
Take your dirty,
cow-herdin'
hands off of me.
Look, I said
to get in the wagon.
I'll get in
when I want to.
I saidnow.
Let go of me!
Put me down!
I'll kill you.
Let me go!
Oh, let me go!
Watch out,
just watch out.
Next time,
your eyes come out.
All right, pick up your
blankets and move in.
You're not going to
put him inthere.
Well, he can't ride
sitting up front.
We haven't got
an extra wagon.
There's no place
else to put him.
All he needs
is bandage changing,
so the wound doesn't fester.
If he lives,
figures the judge will take that
into consideration.
Rowdy?
All right, then.
We'll see you
at Prescott Crossing.
All right, Pete.
See you later, Pete.
Good luck.
See you later,
Mr. Favor.
Yah!
Yah!
Lennie, look.
Dallas.
How did you do that?
That cowhand forgot
to snap the lock.
Now, look, we've got
to delay this wagon.
Wait a minute-
you don't want him
to hear, do you?
He can't hear a thing.
Lennie, the man
with the brain-
he'll find a way
to delay this wagon.
Aw, shut up.
Give Luke time
to catch up.
He'll set us free.
Luke won't find it so easy.
The man on this wagon
is no fool.
If they get us
to Fort Gregg,
we're finished.
We got one chance.
We have to delay this wagon
until Luke catches up.
Now, you do what
I tell you, maybe...
Look what you've
accomplished so far.
Bandage shook loose.
The wound's open.
Uh, hey, hand me
one of those rags there.
Nobody hates a lawman
like you, Dallas.
The Mexicans sure make
a sharp blade.
All right, now...
the deputy, we know,
is buried here.
There was some shooting,
so we know maybe
somebody was shot.
Lennie or the marshal.
Yeah, or maybe Dallas.
If it was Dallas...
It'll cut a man in
half just as easy.
That herd you talked about
picked up the Sedalia Trail.
Their wagon's headed
for Fort Gregg again.
Somebody's driving,
somebody's riding guard.
Wait a minute.
Marshal's got some help.
Yeah.
All right, Jed,
let's mount up
and keep going.
Our trail's cleaner
than a hound's tooth.
There's another way
to Fort Gregg.
It's rougher but shorter.
About a mile
east of here.
I don't figure anybody
can beat us in.
Maybe not.
We'll just go along
this stream a ways.
Just might
fool somebody
in a hurry to
get to Gregg.
Right.
Yah!
We ain't noonin' yet.
We're crossing
a stream.
We'll have to
stop in a bit.
We'll do it right
this time.
None of you make
a move until I say.
I thought we'd agreed that
you had failed as a leader.
And you figure you're
right for the job?
Well, let's take a vote.
Norm,
what do you say?
Lennie or me?
Well, I-I don't know.
You've got to vote.
There's a saying
that anybody
who interferes in another man's
business ends up on a spit.
You sure don't live
by the sayings of
where you come from.
YeahWell, that's why I left.
Now, this boy's got
trouble enough.
Why don't you
let him be.
Well, how about you?
I'll follow anybody
who can show me an exit.
Uh-huh.
Virgo's with me.
How do you know?
I hold his proxy.
I vote for myself-
that makes two votes.
Who'd follow you?
A man who murdered
his own wife?
That was an act of mercy.
She was ill; she lingered on.
I was the perfect husband
all that time, when...
until I found out
that behind my back
she'd given all her money
to her mother and her sister.
So I had to kill them, too.
It's easy, the way I do it.
Quiet... and leaves no mess.
You ain't fit for
decent company.
You know, Lennie,
you remind me of my wife.
Lingering on.
You're ill,
an incompetent, a fool.
All right, you
two, cut it out!
Come on! Lennie!
Let's see what's
going on back there!
I'll cover you.
Dallas, you can
ride topside.
They fighting over you?
What difference
does it make?
Thanks for changing
the marshal's bandage.
That lawman can't stand
much more of this jogging.
Guess you're not as hard
as you think you are, Dallas.
Understand me, trail boss,
I'm glad that man is dying,
because you're gonna
have to stop this wagon
if you want him to live.
We'll stop as soon as we find
a place protected to noon.
Only protection
is to free me.
Why do you want to die
because of a lot of folks
you don't even know?
Nobody wants to die.
A man just does
what he feels is right.
When you're looking down
the barrel of Luke's gun,
you'll change your mind.
Maybe.
I hope not, but maybe.
Hey, Luke!
Yeah.
Whoever it is,
they're smart enough
to know the shortcut.
It cost us over an hour.
They're still on the way
to Fort Gregg.
Whoa!
Better check our back trail,
Rowdy.
All right.
You're only beginning
to get nervous.
You want to wrestle?
We've still got two falls to go.
You can build a fire
over there.
If you make any smoke,
nobody eats.
Marshal, you all right?
Yeah. The girl helped me.
I've been thinking
of staying here overnight,
give that wound
a chance to heal.
No. No, we-we've got
to get to Fort Gregg.
All right, we'll go on.
You want anything to eat?
Just a little water.
Don't worry about me.
Keep your eyes
on the prisoners.
Especially that
Englishman.
I don't trust him.
Nothing behind us
but space.
All right,
let's move on.
And douse that fire
real good.
Rowdy! Get that fire!
Throw some
dirt on it!
Stay where you are!
Get back in the wagon,
all of you.
You heard him. Move.
What are you doing this for?
You want to be
alive when your husband
catches up, don't you?
Come on up here.
Come on up and rescue us.
While you're doing that,
that redneck up there's
gonna strangle Luke's wife.
Even if you shoot us,
he'll still kill her.
What's one woman
more or less to him?
Go on with your
prison wagon.
We're waiting for Luke.
Aren't we?
One shot from you,
and she goes.
And you shoot,
one of us goes.
What's that get you?
Two of us gone.
The rest of us bang your heads
to pieces with these!
Hold them, Rowdy.
All right, get in.
Hey, where's the boy?
Go on, get in.
Get in the back. Come on.
He ain't gonna kill her,
Mr. Favor!
He ain't gonna kill nobody!
Are you hurt, Dallas?
What do you want me to say?
Don't want you
to say nothing.
You all right, Norm?
Yes, sir.
All right, get back
down to the wagon.
Let's go, Sinclair.
Come on.
Yah!
Giddap!
Both of them out.
Not me.
Well, you might
as well be.
Do you think I failed?
Do you think
Dallas failed?
You failed the
biggest of us all.
No, no, because I found out
something very important.
Eh, what are you saying?
I nearly pulled it off,
didn't I?
If you'd kept this boy
from interfering,
I'd have succeeded.
All right, you tell me,
what did you find
out by failing?
Oh, I don't expect you
to understand this.
Never mind what
you don't expect
me to understand!
And we've got a...
traitor in our midst,
a dirty, lousy traitor
who shouldn't be allowed
to hear me.
I'm not a traitor,
Mr. Sinclair.
I want to get out of this
as much as anybody,
but you did wrong
trying to kill that girl.
You did wrong,
and I stopped you.
Very fine, very noble.
Now, you didn't
answer me, redneck.
Now, what did you find out
by failing to spring us?
A matter of strategy.
I found out
it's not what you do
but where you do it.
What do you mean?
There's a water crossing
between here and Fort Gregg.
The trail boss
will have his hands full
crossing the water.
That's where.
You understand me?
That's where.
Yah!
I'd never sit next
to you if you did
what I did.
You do things for what
you think is right.
Got to admire you
for that.
It's just
too bad that...
Look, I don't need
your pity.
Too bad that what you
think is right isn't.
'Cause I hate the law?
The law made
one mistake.
Why throw your life away?
All that talk.
Just watch out,
that's all I got to say.
Just watch out.
This is the place.
There's riders behind us.
How many?
Four, and they're
coming fast.
How far?
About a mile.
Well, if we can get
across that river
we got a chance.
And up that hill.
It can't be
too far to Gregg.
You know, I could hold
them off pretty good
from that ridge
right over there.
There's plenty of places
to hold them off
once we're across.
I don't think that wagon's
going to make it
across that stream.
We'll have to try.
Haven't got time
to look for a ford.
Look, we'll unhitch
the team, take them across.
There's a block
and fall up front there.
You anchor it
to that big tree,
and we'll use the team
to haul the wagon across.
Think we got
enough rope?
There's plenty
up there.
They probably got it
for times like these.
All right.
Move over, Dallas.
Why don't you leave me
here on this side of the river?
Luke won't follow you.
Can't do that.
You're a fool.
You may be right
about that.
You better take
this gun, Mr. Favor.
Right.
You going to cross
that water?
That's right.
You can't mean to cross
it with us inside this wagon.
Supposing it sinks?
I plan to let you out.
Some of us can't swim.
You can raft across
on top of the wagon.
Come on, let's go.
Look here...
With these on, we'd be
just as trapped up there
as we would be in the wagon.
If anything should happen,
drowning isn't
the most pleasant death.
Sure wouldn't want
to see anybody die
unpleasantly.
Now you three
get the marshal
and get ready to put
him up on top.
You two climb up front,
get up there
and give him a hand.
Come on, let's go.
With these on?
Let's go.
Climb.
Here's your water
crossing, redneck.
What do we do now?
Wait till he
starts across.
When we get to the middle
of the stream we'll jump him.
Get ready up there.
All together now.
Let's go.
The rest of you
get up on top.
Holy smokes.
I don't like this.
Neither do I.
Hang on, Dallas.
Hang on tight,
all of you.
Ready.
Come on,
come on.
Tell us when, Luke.
When they get
to the middle.
When they're up
to their necks.
Rowdy, pull up
that slack!
I am.
Get up.
Come on, come on.
Help! Help!
Help!
Help!
All right,
bring her in here.
You better
get us in.
Lennie's hurt.
Shut up, redneck.
I'm all right, Luke.
Tell them to shut up, Jed.
She's coming around.
Honey?
Luke.
Yeah, honey, it's me.
Oh, Luke.
Come on.
She all right?
Yeah, she's all right.
Shut up.
Well, cow head...
looks like I win
the last fall.
Yeah.
Let's get out
of here, Luke.
Sure, honey.
We got to take care
of a few lawmen.
Not that it makes
any difference,
but we're not
lawmen.
You sure acted
like it.
You deserve
whatever you get.
See, mister, me
and my wife,
we're not over-fond
of the law.
We respect it.
Respect it so much,
we try very hard
not to get caught.
That's being
more sensible
than you were
when you took
over that prison
wagon, ain't it?
Well, maybe you've
learned your lesson now.
Maybe next time you won't
interfere in something
that's none of your business.
Hey, Jed.
You got charges
in that rifle
for each of them?
Yeah, you bet.
Then what are you
waiting for?
Shoot 'em down.
No.
If you're going
to shoot somebody, see?
Who did that?
The Englishman.
One of those?
Yeah.
You all right, Lennie?
I'm all right, Luke.
Which one's
the Englishman?
I am.
See how it's done?
How easy it is?
See how easy
it is for you?
Leave 'em be, Luke.
Like he told you,
they're not lawmen.
Now, honey, I can't
leave 'em be.
Now, let me see...
Dallas honey, you're up
on that Bible stuff.
I want to do for him
what he has done...
An eye for an eye...
a tooth for a tooth.
That's it.
And eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth.
No, on second thought,
I think I'll take care
of this myself.
Now you stand aside, woman.
I want to remove
temptation from your eyes
like the preacher says.
I told you, Luke,
they're not lawmen.
All the more reason
to blame them
for taking on
this chore.
They didn't mean
nothing. Let 'em go.
What are you talking about?
You want them
to wander into town
and set the wolves on us?
They won't, Luke,
I swear they won't.
You...
You swear for them?
Have they taken
you over?
Listen, Luke...
You-you saw him
save my life.
Stand aside, Dallas.
Luke, there's no need
to kill him.
Are you for him
or are you for me?
Will you stand aside?!
You try it and I'll shoot,
so help me.
Now, tell you what, honey...
you put up that gun
and we'll go on from here,
and pretend like you never
made this play.
Just as soon as I see them
safely on their way.
I was the one taught you
how to use that gun.
You taught me a lot of things.
Maybe some of them wrong.
Watch out, Dallas.
You don't think I'd shoot
my own wife, do you, mister?
What happens now,
Mr. Favor?
I mean... what happens
to me?
I don't know,
Dallas.
Sure you do.
You're going to take me
to Fort Gregg.
I'd be...
I'd be disappointed if you
went against yourself now.
Only...
take it real slow on the trail.
I don't want to die in prison.
?Rollin', rollin', rollin',
rollin', rollin', rollin'?
Keep rollin',
rollin', rollin'?
Though the streams
are swollen?
Keep them dogies rollin'?
Rawhide?
Through rain
and wind and weather?
Hell-bent for leather?
Wishin' my gal
was by my side?
All the things
I'm missin'?
Good vittles,
love and kissin'?
Are waiting
at the end of my ride?
Move 'em on, head 'em up,
head 'em up, move 'em on?
Move 'em on,
head 'em up, rawhide?
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in,
ride 'em in, let 'em out?
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in?
Rawhide...?
?Rollin', rollin', rollin'?
?Rollin', rollin', rollin'...?
Hyah!
Hyah!
?Rollin', rollin', rollin',
rollin', rollin', rollin'?
Hyah!
?Rollin', rollin', rollin'...?
