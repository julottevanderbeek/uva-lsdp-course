Wilt thou, Magdelana Borst, take
this man to thy wedded husband
to love, honour and obey him
and forsaking all others,
keep only unto him,
so long as ye both shall live?
I will.
Will thou, Gilbert Martin,
take this woman to thy wedded wife
to love and honour her,
and forsaking all others,
keep thee only unto her,
so long as ye both shall live?
I will.
Let us pray.
Almighty God, look down upon
and bless these two
as they go forth this day
into the wilderness
to make for themselves
a new home.
Guide them, Gracious Father,
protect and keep them
through all the trials
and vicissitudes of life,
that they never cease to remember
this hour and this pledge of love
which they have given,
one to the other
in Thy sacred sight.
Amen.
And now, in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost,
I pronounce you man and wife.
What God hath joined together,
let not man put asunder.
Kiss her, my son.
God bless you, Gilbert.
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, son.
Goodbye, Mrs...
Mother.
- Take good care of her.
- Oh, Mamchen.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Sure was a nice wedding.
Wasn't it?
The cow hitched easy?
Cow?
Mother, goodbye.
My friends, iùs always
been like this since Bible days.
Every generation must make
its own way in one place or another.
Iùs the most beautiful country
I've ever seen.
I told you so.
Mohawk Valley's the prettiest place
in the country, for a fact.
Susie.
Gin.
Have one, just a special
seeing iùs tonight.
You folks come far?
Yes. Albany.
Where?
Albany!
Albany.
Been married long?
Oh, not so long.
How long?
Not so long!
I thought thaùs what you said.
I knew it the minute
I laid eyes on you.
Honeymooners.
You got it written all over
both of you.
Honeymooners.
To your health, madam, sir.
You planning on settling here
in the valley?
Yes. I have a place at Deerfield.
Deerfield? Thaùs pretty far
out of the way, isn't it?
Yes, but it suits me.
What political party do you folks
belong to?
The American.
Any Tories?
Not that I know of, why?
Nothing. I was just wondering.
They say the Indians will join the
British, but I guess iùs just talk.
Well, goodnight.
A queer one, ain't he?
Too many questions to suit me.
And that patch over his eye.
I bet he lost it trying to see
something that wasn't his business.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, ma'am.
Goodnight.
You didn't get scared at what he said
about the Tories and the Indians?
I wasn't even thinking
about Indians.
What were you thinking about?
I was just wondering
if you love me
as much as I love you.
Are there always flies like this?
In real woods there are.
It must be about to rain
the way these take hold.
You'll get used to them
up here.
Lana, we're home now.
Look!
I'll get a fire going.
Iùs just a cabin, but...
I've always thought iùd be nice
living in a cabin.
Iùs so handy to look after things
when iùs small.
It seems so fine to me
because I built it.
It must look small to a girl
who's been raised in a big house.
No, iùs all right, Gil.
We'll like our things
even better when we get there.
I'll put up the mare, we'll eat
something and feel warmer...
Things will look different then.
You better take those wet things
off. You'll be sick.
Gil! Gil!
Gil! Gil!
Thaùs only Blue Back.
He'll murder us!
He'll murder us, Gil!
I'm sorry, Lana.
I had to do it.
You've got to get a hold of yourself.
This is my wife, Blue Back.
She's kind of nervous and tired out.
We had a long, hard trip
and then the rain and everything.
Sure. Much rain.
She didn't expect anybody to drop in
at a time like this.
Me go hunting bring you
half deer. Hang outside.
Half deer, huh?
Thaùs mighty fine of you.
Sit down, I've got some rum.
We'll have a drink.
No, me go now.
Come back again, maybe.
Sure, anytime.
You're a good friend, Blue Back.
Sure fine friends.
Good Christian.
Hallelujah.
Lana...
I'm going home.
Home?
I can't stand it.
Mother was right.
I'm no frontier woman.
I had no idea it was like this.
I hate it!
What are you saying?
You had no right to bring me here.
Iùs awful!
And that horrible man,
that Indian, slipping in here.
Now you're acting crazy again.
Blue Back wouldn't hurt you.
He's as good a Christian
as you or me.
I don't care.
I'm going home!
No, you're not.
You'll stay right here
and do as I say from now on.
You'll get over this foolishness
and stop being scared, understand?
I didn't want to hit you.
I had to do it.
Lana, look at me.
I love you, I need you.
I can't live without you now.
You know that.
Yes.
Look, here's Blue Back again,
see?
You got a fine woman,
but you young man.
You use this on her.
Lick her good!
Make fine woman.
What are you thinking
about now?
Gil!
What are you thinking about?
What this place is going to look like
a couple of years from now.
Next summer we can start
building a barn.
Right on that slope, a hillside barn
like I've always wanted.
After that, we can think about
building a decent house.
I like our house just as it is now.
Sure. I always remember how
you ladies hanker after frame houses.
The place will look so beautiful
you won't care what I look like.
I can get blisters on my hands
and my nose peeled
and thaùs the thanks I get for it.
Leùs see those blisters
you're talking about.
No, now never mind.
Gil, let go.
Why, your hand is sore.
Maybe you oughtn't
come out here.
I want to.
But haying's hard work.
Iùs the hardest job there is.
Iùs no job for a woman.
Now, there you go.
Just because a woman is raised
in a town, she has to be frail.
I'm strong. You said you couldn't
have done it without me.
I sure married myself
some good hired help.
Stop it yourself.
Do you like me as much as
you do your old farm?
Hello, Gil.
Good morning, Lana.
Mighty pretty.
General Herkimer.
Hello, Martin.
This is my wife, Lana.
Ja, ja. Hubsch.
She's as pretty
as the near side of a peach.
Maybe prettier.
And Lana, this is Mrs. Weaver
and her husband.
I'm your nearest neighbour.
I've been meaning to call,
me and George and John here.
How do?
I'm so glad to meet you.
This is Christian's wife, Mrs. Reall,
and her daughter, Martha Ellen.
This is my oldest girl, Mary.
Hello, Mary.
And Mrs. Demooth.
My husband is the Captain.
How do you do?
How do you do?
And Dr. Petry.
How do, Mrs. Martin.
Oh, I'll pass the lot of them.
- Fall in. Outside.
- All right, men.
Hep, hep, hep, hep,
hep, hep, hep, hep.
Don't be afraid of these women.
They're good neighbours,
once they get over being mad
at you for being pretty.
Don't be so silly.
That bonnet you've got on
is giving them a lot of worry.
And they're dying to shoo us off
so they can find out
- if you've a family on the way.
- Nicholas!
We weren't going to tell anybody.
Thaùs just fine.
- Congratulations, Martin.
- Thaùs just fine, a baby.
I don't believe in young folks
waiting, I always say
a man needs help on his place
and the only way to get it
is to have children,
especially boys.
Why, Maggie Weaver, how awful.
- Attention. Fall in.
- Fall in what?
Attention!
Dress to the right!
Thaùs my husband.
Call the roll.
- Amos Brock.
- Here.
- John Weaver.
- Here.
- George Weaver.
- Here.
Gilbert Martin.
Here.
Christian Reall.
Christian Reall.
Christian...
Thaùs me.
Here.
Adam Hartman.
Here.
James McNod.
James McNod.
He couldn't come today.
He had to go and buy flour.
Then I've got to fine him.
Thaùs the law.
You don't have any right to fine
a man for not coming, if he can't.
I thought thaùs what
this war was about.
People paying taxes when they
didn't have no say-so about it.
Thaùs right. Thaùs what
I'm carrying Long Tom for.
Ain't up to me.
Talk to the General.
We can let that go this time.
Thaùs enough of the roll call, too.
You can check up later.
Stand at ease, men.
Neighbours,
ever since New York
and the 12 colonies signed
the Declaration of Independence,
this Revolution has turned
into a real war.
So far, we've been lucky
here in the Mohawk,
but it looks like we are going
to be dragged into it too,
sure as shooting.
Thaùs why I got you here,
to get ready,
no matter what happens.
I guess we all feel the same way
about it.
This is our home and land
and I say iùs worth fighting for.
Only we got to do it by ourselves.
Congress can't help us.
They say Washington needs
all the troops he can get
and that the frontier will have to
look out for itself.
Maybe them soldiers don't like
the liquor we drink up here, huh?
Adam!
Maybe not,
but thaùs what they say.
Now about the Indians.
From all I hear,
the Tories are making them
a lot of big promises.
We got our agents working, too.
We can't tell which way they'll go.
We'll have no trouble with them.
We've always treated them fair.
Maybe, but just the same if you hear
the bell ringing at the fort
or the cannon go off, you drop
everything and come running.
Do you understand?
All of you, come running.
Else I'll have you flogged so fast
you won't know what.
Now, come on, show the women
how good you can drill.
Take them around the field,
Captain.
- Attention.
- Nice talk, Nicholas.
Carry arms!
Squads left, march!
I bet we can lick the whole world,
the way we march.
Ezra! Help us over here.
Put them right on top.
Come on, come on.
Now she's going good.
Is the core rotten, Adam?
Yeah.
Let it fall right down in there.
This'll make a nice patch for wheat.
There's good soil here.
I figure the loam's close
to four feet.
I bet there isn't better soil
in the whole valley.
You're just a natural born farmer,
ain't you?
So would you be,
if you'd marry and settle down.
There she goes! There she goes!
Thaùs going to be good fire wood.
Here goes!
Start her even, Cleave!
Push her in, Gil!
Push her in there.
Pull them straight.
You brought a lot of pretty
things with you, Mrs. Martin.
Heavenly.
I told Mother there was no sense
bringing a lot of clothes.
I'd rather spend the money
on furniture.
I see you've got
one of these feathers.
Yes. Mother had five of them
at home.
She said there are times when that
could be more important than bread.
What is it?
A pheasanùs feather.
It looks like an angel's wing.
We had a lot of them. They collected
so much dust we threw them out.
Yeah.
This is a nice teapot.
Is it a Wedgewood?
I don't know.
Iùs just white china, I guess.
It belonged to my grandmother.
We always ate off Wedgewood
at home.
Come out, they've started
burning already.
Great burning,
started it myself.
Leùs go see the burning,
come on.
Gil, iùs going to be beautiful.
Iùs Blue Back.
Indians on warpath.
Coming.
Eight white men.
Painted.
Better hurry.
Johnny Weaver, get your horse
and tell General Herkimer.
- Stop it!
- Get the horse.
Take this.
Thanks, Joe.
Adam, watch out for Lana.
Come on.
Indians! One, two, three, four,
two, three, four, one...
Come on, Christian.
They're all here.
Get in your wagon.
Here.
Gil, the cow.
Aren't we going to take her?
We can't. She'll just slow us up.
I can't stand it. Iùs like leaving
part of ourselves.
Don't look back.
Hurry up, Gil.
Hey! Come on, Gil.
Mr. Martin!
Mr. Martin!
Come on, Mary.
Wait a minute.
Where's the rest of your family?
I don't know. I lost them.
Come on. Hurry up.
All right.
We got Mary and Martha with us.
Get them in, Christian.
Come on, Trudy.
You help, Mary.
- Where's Nancy?
- Here she is.
- Where's Martha?
- Here's Martha.
We've got to throw some of
this furniture out.
Oh, no, Gil.
We've got to.
We're ready, Gil.
I told you not to look back.
Keep up there!
Keep up there!
Mr. Martin!
You got her?
Gil, whaùs happened?
Oh, Mary Johnson.
Shut up.
Come on!
She was driving
and all of a sudden she fainted.
Never mind.
There, put her down.
- Get out of here.
- I won't. My husbanÔs the captain.
- Get out before I use a strap on you.
- No, they'll kill me.
Get some water and blankets
and tell the doctor to hurry.
I don't understand this.
Never mind, she'll be all right.
- Whaùs the matter here?
- Oh, Doctor.
Iùs my wife, she fainted.
I can't say I blame her,
all this racket.
Gil. Gil Martin.
They're waiting for you.
The company's ready to go.
What is it?
There's nothing you can do.
Go on, get out of here.
How is she, Gil?
I don't know.
- Everything ready?
- Yes, sir.
Drummer boy, play the drum.
Men, follow me!
Adam, did you see them?
Did you catch them?
No. We chased them seven,
eight miles, but they got away.
What happened?
The excitement and all the jolting
was too much,
but don't fret too much, you're both
young. You'll have another baby.
She's all right now.
Just tired.
But don't let her talk too much.
Lana.
Gil.
Lana, darling.
Gil, our house?
They burned it.
The crops?
Everything.
I saw it coming back.
Oh, and now...
Please don't, Lana.
I failed you.
No, Lana. It wasn't your fault.
It just happens that way sometimes.
My poor Gil.
Oh, Lana.
You're all right,
thaùs all I care about.
It seems impossible that people can
work as hard as we did for nothing.
We can build it back again.
We still have the land.
You think I'd let you come back
and go through all that again?
You were right that first night.
You shoulÔve gone home then.
I was a fool not to see it.
I shouldn't have brought you here
in the first place.
This is no place for you,
iùs no place for any woman.
I'm not the only woman
who's gone through this.
What will we do?
How will we live?
Adam says that Mrs. McKlennar's
hired man ran off
and she's looking for a couple
to work her place.
But, Lana, you can't hire out,
a girl like you. Do you think...?
It wouldn't have to be for long.
Just until we made enough
to come back here.
Lana, you can't do it.
It won't do any harm
just to talk it over with her.
No!
Hired help. No!
Mrs. McKlennar!
Good morning.
Your name Martin?
Yes, ma'am.
Well, go on and stare.
I know how I look.
That hired man got drunk and ran off,
he left me with everything to do.
I don't mind a man drinking,
if he knows how to hold it.
When it fixes him so he can't do
his work, he'd better go elsewhere.
Don't stand there with
your mouths open. Sit down.
Leùs get down to business.
You know how to farm?
I had my own place.
Yes, I heard it was burned.
Thaùs too bad,
but thaùs neither here nor there.
Daisy! Get my dinner ready.
I could eat a horse.
I don't do much farming here,
just take care of the meadow
and feed my stock,
but you can do what you like.
I'm a widow. My husband
was Captain Barnabas McKlennar.
Barney, Barney.
What was I saying?
I was brought up on army life,
so when I give an order,
I expect to get it obeyed.
If I take your pay,
I'll do my best.
I just don't want you coming
afterwards complaining.
How much do you want?
I never worked for anybody else.
What do you pay?
Your house, wood and food.
If your wife can sew,
I'll pay her, too.
Can you sew?
Whaùs your name?
Lana.
Can you sew?
Speak up!
You want to sew for me?
Yes, I'd like to.
Let me see your hands.
Thaùs settled.
I hate sewing myself.
Hate any housework, so I do the barn
and let Daisy do the cooking.
I took good care of my husband.
Now he's gone, I do as I like.
I've got a long face,
and I poke it where I please.
You may think I'm a nuisance.
Yes, ma'am.
What? Whaùd he say?
I didn't mean it, but I guess
if you do poke, I'll think so.
Your thoughts are your own property,
but keep them to yourself.
Come on, you'll want to see
your new home.
Use the back door if you want
to ask me anything.
I don't want mud tracked in my house.
I track enough myself.
Iùs a mess now,
after that man,
but iùs a good house.
It sure is, ma'am.
Nice chimney.
Nice bedroom upstairs.
I used to live here,
until Barnabas decided to build
that stone place.
Iùs a beautiful house.
Glad you can see it. There's one more
thing I want to ask you.
Any furniture?
We have a bed and a few things.
I'll help you out with the rest.
You can consider the job
yours, Martin.
Now, any questions you want to ask?
Yes, ma'am.
I just...
Well, what?
Do you belong to the right party?
Right party! A woman
hasn't got any political opinions.
I run this farm to suit myself.
I'll shoot anybody,
British, Indian or American,
who interferes in my business.
That satisfy you?
When can you move in?
Will tomorrow be too soon?
Tomorrow?
Whaùs the matter with today?
We'll move in today.
Good! Good!
Oh, Lana.
Oh, Gil.
Iùs a beautiful fireplace.
Oh, Almighty God,
hear us, we beseech Thee,
and bring succour and guidance
to those we're about to bring
to Thy divine notice.
First, we're thinking
of Mary Wollaber.
She's just 16 years old,
but she's keeping company
with a soldier from Fort Dayton.
He's a Massachusetts man, O Lord
and Thou knowest no good
can come of that.
Hallelujah.
Now, we're thinking of the sick
and infirm.
Peter Paris has the flux real bad.
His Uncle Isaac,
who keeps a store in Dayton
asks for our prayers
and he says that he has got in
a new supply of calicos,
French broadcloths,
fancy handkerchiefs,
new hats and heavy boots
all at bargain prices.
But most of all, we call upon Thee,
Lord Jehovah,
O, God of Battles,
to aid Thy people
against the Tories,
for I have disturbing news for you
that will sorrow this Sabbath.
General Washington has advised us
that an enemy army
of many Tories and savage Indians
is even now on its way
to our beloved valley.
Every man capable of bearing arms
between the ages of 16 and 60
will report tomorrow morning
to General Herkimer,
at which time a regiment
of Washington's Continental Army
will arrive from Albany, under
Colonel Fischer, to help us.
Any man failing to report for duty
will be promptly hanged.
Amen.
You stick close to Mrs. McKlennar
and do what she says.
Yes, Gil.
I'd better go now.
Watch out for those new apple trees.
Gil!
Thank you, ma'am.
It used to be Barney's,
but iùs no use to me now.
It might come in handy to you.
Gil Martin, I'm going to kiss you,
so I'd better do it now,
so you won't go off
with the taste of a widow.
Many is the time I've seen Barney
go off just that same way.
Goodbye.
He's off.
Sometimes he'd wave, but ten to one
he wasn't even seeing me.
He was thinking about all those men,
you see,
all those men going out to fight,
to kill or be killed.
Blast his eyes, loving it.
They sent you over here to tell us
to come inside the fort?
"Iùs orders."Women and children shall
be gathered together"."
Me and other men over 60
are to collect and protect them.
You old rooster! Don't you think
I can look after myself?
Yes, ma'am, but iùs orders.
I've been saving a corner shed
for you.
Shed!
Do you think I'd start living
in a shed at my time of life,
like a cow?
Yes, ma'am.
No, ma'am.
Go on and spit, man.
Spit and get it over with.
Hey! Not there, outside.
Go on, get out of here.
Old fool, he can't even spit
by himself.
Waiting, waiting.
Thaùs all we women do.
Well, no news is good news.
Why don't you sit down, Lana?
Mosquitoes.
Mrs. McKlennar!
Lana! Wake up!
Come on out!
Here they come!
Where's John?
Have you seen Gil Martin?
Gil!
Take them inside. Go in.
Anyone else there. Go in.
Have you seen Gil Martin?
I'm Robert Johnson, surgeon pro tem
of the First Regiment.
Then don't stand there yapping.
Go on in and see the General.
Yes, ma'am.
Mark, where's Gil?
Gil Martin?
Gil!
Gil!
Gi...
I'm Captain Morgan, ma'am.
There's nobody back of me alive.
No.
General Herkimer, a fine mess
you've got yourself into this time.
I tell this fellow to go away.
Look after the young ones.
Shut up! You're not giving
orders in this house.
What about it?
Iùs already mortified, ma'am.
Iùll have to come off.
Ja, bitte?
Ja, Nicholas.
Wait till I light my pipe.
John!
Tell me something first, Doctor.
Did you ever cut off a leg before?
- Why, no, sir. I...
- Well, don't be ashamed.
A man has got to start somewhere.
I'll never forget the first deer
I shot.
Gil! Gil!
Lana!
Lana!
Gil. Oh, thank God.
Iùs so cold here,
colder here than in the woods.
Raining, lying there.
I remember thinking how
hot it was, wondering...
I'm cold.
Wondering how long we'd be away,
when it happened.
I heard a crack...
Daisy, some water.
...like a stick breaking
and all of a sudden the fellow
next to me stopped talking
and fell over on his side.
Then I heard a whistle,
shots from everywhere.
Somebody shouted
we'd been ambushed.
I saw General Herkimer slide
off his horse and grab his knee.
Peter Tenyck with his head
blown half off.
Oh, darling, this is going to hurt.
Somebody told me to lay down
and then I saw them
all smeared with paint,
yellow and red,
every colour.
Oh, darling. I'm sorry.
And back of them, Tories
with green coats.
I got down behind a log
and aimed at a fellow.
He leaped straight up in the air.
Don't talk about it.
Fell forward on his face.
After that, we just kept shooting
as fast as we could load
for I don't know how long.
Amos, Adam Hartman came over
beside me.
His musket was broke,
but he had a spear.
He kept grinning.
I remember thinking,
he's having a good time,
he likes this.
Soon he pointed off. I saw
an Indian coming towards us, naked.
I tried to load,
but it was too late.
Adam stood up and braced his spear,
and the Indian came down.
I never saw a fellow look so funny,
so surprised.
He just hung there,
with his mouth open.
Looking at us
and not saying a word.
I had to shoot him,
there wasn't anything else to do.
I had to.
Brandy, Nicholas?
Ja, ja.
Swallow, swallow.
Now, Nicholas.
Go ahead.
Then it started to rain
and I was sick.
All the time, General Herkimer sat
there smoking and holding his knee.
Then he said we'd all better go home.
Darling, don't talk about it.
Out of 600 of us,
about 240 were still alive.
But we'd won.
We licked them.
Yes, darling.
We showed them
they couldn't take this valley.
Yes, darling.
Lana, do you hear?
We won.
Yes, darling.
You won.
Now, you've got to sleep.
You...
Adam, help me get him down.
Get that pack there.
Yes. Here.
Sleep, darling.
You sleep.
Lana.
Lana.
Oh, Gil.
I feel as if I've been asleep
forever.
You needed it.
I've been lying here looking at you,
thinking how pretty you are.
Darling.
It made me think of the first days
we had together at Deerfield.
I've been thinking about that, too.
The things we'd planned.
While I was out there,
I kept thinking about you
all the time.
About how good iùll be when
iùs all over and we can go home.
Gil, the Indians,
they won't be coming back
this way again, will they?
I don't reckon so, after the licking
we gave them. Why?
We're going to have another baby.
Are you glad, Lana?
I feel as...
I feel as though I've begun
to live all over again.
Are you hungry?
Doctor, how's General Herkimer?
The General is dead.
We couldn't stop the bleeding.
I am the resurrection
and the life, saith the Lord.
He that believeth in me,
though he were dead,
yet shall he live.
And whosoever liveth
and believeth...
I know my Redeemer liveth,
and He shall stand
at the latter day upon the earth.
And though after my skin,
worms destroy this body
yet in my flesh I shall see God.
Come on, don't stop.
You know what Doc Petry said
about having plenty of hot water.
I know, but the water's boiled away
twice and nothing's happened.
I don't know why we need so much
hot water when babies are born.
Mr. Martin!
Mrs. McKlennar wants you at once.
Gil, one of Barney's soldiers
made this cradle,
gave it me the night
we were married.
You and Lana
might as well have it.
Iùs mighty kind of you.
Nonsense.
What good is it to me?
Can't ever tell,
a good looking widow like you.
Shut up, you make me sick.
Great big good-for-nothing,
loud mouthed fool.
Even if you are good looking.
Get out of my way!
Poor Gil.
Not yet boys, not yet.
Iùs the waiting around that...
Not knowing whaùs going on.
Why can't Dr. Petry do something?
Why can't he?
I don't know, Gil.
Blue Back, you've had experience.
What do you think?
Having babies,
thaùs woman's business.
She better go far, far,
by herself.
Leave husband alone.
Daisy!
Hurry with those things.
This is terrible.
Gil Martin, get some hot water quick!
Thaùs all right.
Thaùs all right.
George Weaver, you keep away
from that spring house.
I'll get some more wood.
Iùs a boy.
Praise be to the Lord!
A boy! Gil!
Gil!
Iùs a...
- Iùs a boy.
- Iùs a boy.
Iùs a boy. Joe, we've got a boy!
Hallelujah.
Christian, iùs a boy.
We've got a baby boy.
What?
A baby boy.
A boy?
Yes.
A baby boy?
Sure.
To think at my age, another son.
Get some brandy.
Brandy! For a little...
No. For you.
Go on in.
Is she all right?
Fit as a fiddle.
Who does he look like?
He's going to faint.
Oh, Lana, never again.
Gil,
I prayed so hard it would be boy.
Take him in your arms,
just for a moment.
Go ahead.
Doggone.
We'II, I'll be doggoned.
Come on, everybody,
the dance is starting.
I bet Barney never kissed you
like that.
Barney McKlenner was a real man.
When he kissed, you stayed kissed.
Leùs see if he taught you
how to hold your liquor.
He didn't need to.
I was born knowing that.
Hooray! To the greatest crop
in the Mohawk Valley,
and the man who's responsible for it,
Gil Martin.
To the bride and groom,
Mary and John Weaver.
May they always be as happy
as they are tonight.
Please God, please let it go on
like this forever.
Come on, Gilly.
You're going to help Mama
find some nice wild honey.
Ups-a-daisy. Come on.
Here we go.
That you, Daisy?
Go away.
What do you want?
What are you doing here?
What do you mean coming
in my house?
Burn house, fire quick.
Don't you dare.
You filthy drunken rascals!
Get out of here quick
before I skin you alive.
Get out of here.
What are you doing?
My bed! You crazy horse thieves.
If I could get my hands
on a butcher knife.
Daisy! Lana! Gil!
My bed!
Take your hands off that bed.
You go quick!
You catch fire!
I won't move a step without my bed.
My husband bought this
the day after I was married.
Stop that! Shame on you.
Get this bed out of here.
Get this bed out of here.
Sure.
Hurry up, quick!
Hurry up, you fools. I'll have
your ears lopped off for this.
Put it up!
Turn it upside down.
Now, turn it up.
You fools!
Mrs. McKlennar!
Mrs. Mc...
Mrs. McKlennar, what are you doing?
Go away!
My husband built this house.
I've lived in it all my life
and I'm not going to leave it.
Gil!
Go away!
Listen, you can't...
Lana!
Gil!
Go away and leave me alone.
Mrs. McKlennar!
Lana! Gil!
Gil! Lana! Andrusville has
been wiped out.
There's over a thousand headed
this way under Caldwell.
You've got to get to the fort.
I'm not leaving this house.
I've lived...
Come on, Sarah.
Leave me alone!
Oh, Almighty God,
by whose divine assistance
Samson did smite the Philistines
hip and thigh with great slaughter,
help Thy people now gird up
their loins for the coming battle.
Put courage in our hearts, Lord,
that we may drive our enemies
back into the wilderness.
For we all know only too well
what will happen to us
if these Sons of Belial
ever get over these walls,
or come in through that gate
which, with Thy permission, Lord,
I now order closed.
Amen.
Close the gate.
Tether all the animals
or drive them out!
You women and children,
go into the church.
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
If you can't get your hair
into those hats, cut it off!
It won't do you any good if those
greasy devils get in here.
Daisy! Daisy!
Now, sing, children,
sing, in praise of the Lord!
Woman!
Brother Reall,
put down that Devil's brew.
I was trying to get rid of it,
so them heathens wouldn't get it.
Beware of the heathen within
thine own breast. Cast it away!
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah.
Do you think they'll attack tonight?
With Caldwell leading them,
they will.
Whaùs that?
Thaùs them.
Alarm.
There goes our barn,
off to the right of those trees.
There goes my place.
No, thaùs Ritter's.
Then mine's next to it.
Hold your fire. Save your ammunition.
They're trying to draw us out.
Back to your place.
Martin is right.
Trust in the Lord and wait until
you can make every shot count.
You filthy, painted heathens.
Consume them, Lord,
as Thou didst thine enemies
in the days of Jeremiah.
Gil! Adam, come on!
Here they come!
Ready with those rifles, women.
God have mercy on his soul.
I must be shooting a little
to the left.
Here you are, George.
Loaded!
Now shoot the breeches off them,
if they're wearing any.
Daisy, come on.
Loaded.
Clean shot.
Get to the gate.
Call the filthy beggars back.
We'll wait till the moon sets.
Oh, Barney, if you were only here,
we'd show them.
We'd show...
Hold me up.
I can't breathe lying down.
Lana, come beside me.
Give me your hand.
Now, now, don't start tuning up.
I want you and Gil
to have my place, everything.
You've been like my own
flesh and blood.
Look under the front porch.
I buried some gold pieces there,
just in case.
Divide it up among
the lot of you.
Gil.
Goodbye, good looking.
Barney.
Barney!
For Thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory forever.
Amen.
How's the ammunition, Parson?
Mighty low.
Ammunition's mighty low, O Lord.
I go Fort Dayton for help.
Thaùs a job for me, Joe.
I know every foot of the way,
if anybody can, I can.
Joe!
Joe.
Parson, do you mind?
He'll need it.
Oneida trail, huh, Joe?
Good luck, Joe.
He got away.
Listen.
Adam!
Thaùs shooting, Adam.
You filthy murdering,
thieving...
God, our merciful Father,
forgive me for what I'm about to do.
Amen.
Get away, I'm all right.
Gil, what about...
Somebody's...
I'm going, Parson.
Good luck, Gil.
Joe, did he...?
He did not.
I'm going to try it myself, Lana.
If I make the woods,
I can outrun them.
They'll kill you.
You're not going to be afraid.
You're not going to be afraid.
They'll kill you.
No, they won't.
If I can get in the clear,
there isn't an Indian living
that can catch me.
Say you're not afraid
and you want me to go.
Lana.
I'm not afraid,
I want you to go.
Lana, he got away.
Leùs start.
Any sign of them yet?
Blue Back says iùs quiet,
too quiet out there.
Quiet, Chief.
He left before sunrise.
Iùs almost 12 now.
If he reached Fort Dayton,
help would be here by now.
Parson!
They're over the wall!
Every man to his post.
Have you seen Lana?
No, I ain't Gil.
Parson, have you seen Lana?
I killed a man.
Lana!
Lana!
Iùs me. Iùs Gil.
Where's Caldwell?
Where's Caldwell?
Where's Caldwell?
Squad left, mark!
Company halt!
Order arms!
At ease!
- Where are you men going?
- Home.
- Home?
- The war's over.
Cornwallis surrendered
to Washington last week.
So thaùs our new flag,
the thing we've been fighting for.
and 13 stars in a circle
for the Union.
Iùs a pretty flag, isn't it?
Soldier, let me take that flag.
We did a little fighting
around here ourselves.
I reckon we better be getting back
to work.
There's going to be a heap
to do from now on.
RIP & SUBS MINYATUR
