THE PROPHET, THE GOLD
AND THE TRANSYLVANIANS
Romulus, I hope that you're
understanding what you're reading.
It's ok, continue,
but you can do it a lot better.
I have it.
Be careful to look for the station,
I don't know it's name.
Ion is waiting for us there.
But you have his letter, right?
I have it.
Ok, ok. Continue to read.
How do you do?
Listen to them,
are they talking about us?
I think that the mister wants to know who we are.
Answer him.
Yes Mister! Romania!
Village Poplaca!
Hey!
I haven't crossed the ocean for you to
start smoking!
Thank you.
What is he saying?
I don't know.
Then, why are you still reading
that "Bible"?
Romi...
I've drunk a lot in my day,
but I've never drunk whisky.
Weak, only about 30% proof.
Try this.
This is what we call "tzuica".
Hey Romi.
Play something on your whistle.
It's not allowed here.
When you get two slaps from me,
you'll see what's allowed and what's not.
Be calm, it's their business.
We have our own affairs.
Hey!
-This is our station.
-And why did you not tell me?
Then, let's go.
Please forgive us.
Tell them something in English. If not,
they may believe that we are uncivilised.
Please forgive us.
Follow me!
We stay here,
until they solve their
problems.
Hey, I think this is Ion.
Look at him, he was
photographed.
I think he is a very important person.
Probably a politician.
Hey shepherd!
You said that we mustn't
enter in the conflict.
Yeah ,yeah.
Give me my bag!
At least...
load it first.
You must shut up, "Mucho".
If we get in trouble,
who's responsible? "Mucho" is responsible.
What is this? A Circus?
Fall out!
March!
I got it at Plevna.
From the Turks.
Spoils of war
Hey Iooooooooooon!!!
What is he saying?
I don't know,
he doesn't speak like in the dictionary.
Shut up with your
dictionary.
Money thrown out the window,
you're stupid.
Say something,
maybe he'll understand you.
Hey Iooon!
Friend.
Friend.
What is he saying?
Do you want a slap?
And don't stare at these bitches,
they're not for you.
All they want is money.
Is Ion here?
- What is he saying?
- He said to play cards.
Tell him that we don't have any money.
Thanks.
Mister, if you think that you can beat
me, then you're crazy.
Take the money.
Romi...
You must know that this is
a beautiful game.
And when you think that I've
never played before.
What is he saying?
But him?
I don't know.
I've already told you that he doesn't
speak like in the dictionary.
Mister, listen to me.
When you have a seven...
you're in.
What is he saying?
It looks like you've won him.
Bless me Lord.
How can you win a man by
playing cards? He's not a cow.
No way, NO WAY!
But, if that's the tradition around
these parts...
I'll buy drinks for
everyone.
Tzuica.
What's your name?
Well Bob...
Take a shot from here.
Let's drink and get
to know each other.
I'm called Traian Brad.
This is whisky.
God's garden must be huge.
Who is this man?
What is he saying?
Well mister...
We, I mean me and this boy,
who is my little brother...
we've come here from
Poplaca.
We crossed "The Big Water",
the ocean.
I'll never forget it.
Everything I ate,
was puked back up.
We're here in America for
our brother, Ion.
To earn some money,
our country is poor.
We even have the letters from him.
Take out the letter, don't stare at me.
And I think you know him.
Everybody knows him,
look.
This is Ion.
Aaaaaa, I get it.
He says that we're under arrest.
How can I say in their language:
F.... you?
I don't know, it isn't written in
the dictionary.
Romi, we're in trouble.
And this happened...
because I entered in the conflict
at the station.
Maybe I hurt someone.
And I've told you not
to get involved!
And I've also told you on the road!
And you with the dictionary!
And, if the father from Poplaca  finds out?
I will be ashamed to meet him.
And your "smart" brother ...
Ehhhhh now...
If I catch him, I'll break his bones.
Don't call me on my name,
if I won't do this.
And you,
what are you talking about?
It was better at home.
Yeah sure.
- You're very "smart".
- Yes?
Take out your whistle
and play something.
Maybe our homesickness
will pass.
Ehhhh, now,
I don't really want this.
Maybe you want something
from me.
Yeah yeah.
Please Romica.
- What does he want?
- How should I know?
I think Ion has changed,
since he left Poplaca.
But into something that's normal,
around this parts.
Learn.
To work.
Be back.
Home!
To live like normal people.
What do you want
from us?
It's because we won
at poker?
Take your money back,
and fuck you!
Brother, what do they
want from us?
Hey man...
Sit next to me.
Hey...
Maybe he's a Turkish
priest.
Hey Romi...
As I see it, hard work
is waiting for us.
What does he want?
How should I know?
Don't keep asking me this!
Every day you're asking:
"What is he saying?".
Hey, listen here.
I think that I'll hurt
this woman if she keeps talking.
Romi!
Tell this man that if he
touches me...
is a dead man, even that
I'll remain here for life.
Where are we going now?
I don't know, people
are like shit around here.
Youre a bad man.
And a motherfucker.
I wont forget you.
Man, with this salute
you've touched my heart.
Hey!
Hey, have you caught
something?
Not too good.
Hey, look what
I've found.
Good job.
You've started to
collect pebbles.
Maybe in the future you'll play
with...
God forbid.
He says that is gold.
Gold? Ha ha.
Everyone will laugh at you.
Do you hear smart boy?
Pepitas.
Toys, dolls.
Let's go home.
I shot a deer.
Ion!
You're finally here.
- Well well, you even have a flag.
- Of course.
Come inside.
Hey Romi,
wake up!
Look who's here.
What are you doing?
Oh, I see that you have
a very nice household.
What was I suposed to
do?
Wait for you?
Are you hungry?
Since you left Poplaca,
you think you're royalty.
You have "tzuica"?
I've tried some berries from here,
but we don't have a boiler.
How did you find
this man?
Bob?
I won him at poker.
- Ion.
- ?
What have you been doing
around these parts?
It's a long story.
And it's "her" time.
I don't even know how
to begin.
in America, I've done a lot of things.
I was a farmer, a porter, a hunter...
a salesman, a cowboy.
It was very hard.
I heard that here...
gold could be found.
Others came too.
And yes, we found gold,
and we shared the land.
We worked hard,
and the things were good.
In a couple of years we were rich.
But a man caught us.
I know him.
He didn't catch me.
Everything is in his grip
around here.
Marshall is his son.
- A marshal.
- He's the sheriff.
He took everything.
He took the gold, telling us that we had exploited
his land. Those who stood up to him were "cleansed".
How about "lei" ?
Can they be found here?
No, only dollars.
But the only law here, Traian,
....
is the gun.
The miners were scared,
and they were subjugated.
I refused to bow down,
and they were on me.
They hired a killer to
"cleanse" me.
And I think that
you've "cleansed" him.
And the defenders of the law,
are looking for you everywhere.
And I....
When I saw your picture,
I thought that you were "a big man".
I was also in jail
for you.
And this....
is your wife?
She's too young for you.
.... wants to be his wife.
How? He already has a wife.
He has 15 wives.
- 15?
- 15, 15.
Their religion says
that you can have multiple wives.
Here, he's a priest.
Ehhh, a priest.
Priest without a stole.....
horse without a tail.
Is he a Turk?
I was in Turkey once,
in '77 during the war.
Which war?
Which war?
In what world are you living?
In the new world.
Dear brother......
Now I'm upset.
Don't you read the papers?
How it's possible not to know,
that our country, Romania,
had a war with Turkey,
at Grivita, Plevna?
Give me some paper.
So....
We, the Transylvanians,
thought that we must go there.
And we went.
We'd seldom crossed the mountains before,
because it was fotbidden.
Anyway, nobody can stop me,
when I want something.
I've passed....
You know how much military service I've done,
at.........regiment.
How was it possible to stay at home,
when our country, Romania, was fighting for freedom.
I was injured too.
I've got my military
honors at Plevna.
After my return to Poplaca,
the authorities were looking for me.
And they asked me a lot
of questions.
Because of the poverty,
by the time I got that letter from you,
I was already on the road to this place.
Look at him.
I'm here for him.
So he can learn something.
I've heard that here,
in America...
Hey...
Your brother,
Ion.
Oh, Ion!
Romi....
you've grown.
And Bob....
very happy.
You saw that I'm wanted
for 500 dollars.
Dead or alive.
But, we'll see about this.
Now that you're here,
we'll try to make some rules.
No!
No rules, we're going home.
I have money.
I've won it in one minute.
Hey, the people here are stupid
at playing their games.
I was showing my cards,
they were giving me money....
So, no rules.
On the ship, and home.
- Brother?
- Yeah?
Sometimes the way back is
longer.
Look what I've found.
What have you found?
It looks like gold.
Bob says that it's gold.
Yeah, you only see gold.
I want to learn this.
I'll teach you.
Go to the bottles.
Ion, are you calling that a gun?
Look here.
I got this from the Turks.
Romi...
Come here.
You can have this.
If someone will shoot you,
I'm gonna kill you.
You'll demolish the fence.
Wait....
Hey priest.....
get off the horse.
We have some problems
to solve.
Get down!
Walk!
Ion...
I'll judge this one.
Girl, Romi!
Come here.
You see?
You tied me, right?
And you whipped me!
You've done all this to me,
to me?
You can't do this.
I've faced the Turks...
He doesn't even know how to fight.
Romi!
Are you missing my
slaps?
Common, rub my back.
Bob's place...
with...
the table.
What is he saying?
He says that he wants
to come with us.
Wait till they see us with him
in Poplaca.
Ion...
Come here.
Now, we're going home,
give me your toy.
- Which toy?
- The gun.
Ion?
What do you think?
-Can we find here a Romanian priest?
- Yes.
I'm afraid to not
be ashamed.
