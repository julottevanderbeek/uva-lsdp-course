Find any gold in your new mine?
No, no Nothing yet.
Yeah, yeah. Four years you've
wasted with nothing to show for it
Hey Sam, Your young man arrive
yet?
I'm here but he's late showin' up
Hey, stay under. Don't you see the
rain?
What, don't you think me wise
enough to keep my head dry?
Too old, that it? Not young enough
to have no sense?
That's it precisely.
Age is no offense.
I keep getting older with nothin' to
show for it.
The desire is there but no pleasure.
You still got some bite. Tomorrow
we'll get the supplies
Yeah yeah, what do l have to fear?
Of age? Of anything?
Soon we'll be . . . . rich.
I hope I can be useful out there.
My double crossing partner did
most of the work last time
No feeling left in these hands.
Perhaps there is one thing that can
arouse your sense of touch
Well maybe there is.
Perhaps . . . . . . perhaps
The path is getting narrower.
Very treacherous ahead.
Careful, there could be falling rocks
Careful, we can't lose any of the
equipment.
Clumsy oaf.
You're going down there.
I can't go down there.
-You dropped it. You get it.
-No! You'll leave me down there.
-We need everything.
- No, it's too dangerous.
No more talk!
-Let him climb back himself.
- are you crazy?
Get me out of here!
Hurry up, we're losing time.
He's shaken up. Just give us a
minute.
Tough. We've got to move. Now!
Now!
No ones touched it. No one.
