When was Brazil discovered ?
In 1500.
Again.
Independance, which year ?
Freedom for slaves ?
In 1888.
The Republic ? Which year ?
The year of the death of Lampiao ?
"I came here,
- I have no family, nor a name -"
"pulled by the wind,"
"for a last fight against hunger."
"I carry with me the people
of this brazilian sertao."
"I've put back on my head
a cangaceiro hat."
"I want to see the men
of this town appear."
"The pride and the wealthy
of the dragon of spite."
"Today I'm going away,
but someday, I'll be back."
"And, to this pitiless day,
not a stone will survive."
"Because vengeance has two faces :"
"the one of Love,
and the one of Hate."
"Say three Our Father's.
Lampiao, Our Lord !"
Dr Mattos,
I remember
as if it was yesterday.
On a road, I met Lampiao.
He stopped by, and from his eyes
pure tears flowed.
And he added : "Antonio..."
"Don't you want to join the cangaçao ?"
Doctor...
I wanted to, but...
my pride made me refuse.
The good-looking and blond
Corisco then appeared.
He said to him :
"Let me bleed this ape."
But Lampiao answered him :
"Not him, he's a man of honor."
"He's an enemy, but he's loyal."
Dr Mattos,
Lampiao was my mirror.
The next morning,
I was already hunting him.
One day, in the middle of a road
and in the middle of a gunfight,
Lampiao would yell at me :
"Antonio, Is it you Antonio ?"
When Corisco did recognize me,
he became mad.
He jumped and shot...
and the wind shook his hair...
which floated like gold flags.
Then, I killed him
and everything was over.
And now you tell me,
that there's still cangaceiros...
I can't believe you.
I agree to do what you ask me to.
But I don't want money.
I'll go to the Garden of the Piranhas,
to see if it's true...
that they still exist.
Madalena,
ready my old trunk,
put in my rifle and my hat.
I'm traveling.
Cursed by ten churches
Rejected by all saints
Antonio das Mortes
Killer of the Cangaceiros
Bring him on, Batista.
Bring him on!
It's him, Laura.
Coronel, here's Antonio das Mortes.
He came to watch over the cangaceiros...
I asked you for police reinforcements.
Antonio is better.
If he kills, there will be no investigation,
nor questioning,
nor press article.
And he doesn't want money.
Mattos, a free mercenary
brings bad luck.
Furthermore, it's useless.
Some say that this cangaceiro
is nothing but theater.
Maybe, coronel,
but a "nothing" could spoil the future
of the Garden of the Piranhas.
I want to install industry.
Investors from the south
will require order.
We must end the violence.
The agrarian reform will resolve the struggles.
What ? Agrarian reform ?
Yes, coronel,
Agrarian reform.
This is the progress,
sign of the times.
Me, to share my lands ?
Did you become crazy ?
To share my lands,
with these work-shies ?
Is the government mad ?
It is not its task to care about
the things of the land.
It's mine.
It has to care about machines.
The land, it's my business.
Don't talk to me about american help,
agrarian reform or industry
and other lies.
I only know my cows.
Something else.
I don't fear no misfortune.
And I don't need Antonio das Mortes.
I only want Laura.
Laura, my love, come near me.
Agrarian reform... To share
my lands with these work-shies...
They'll have to fight too.
I don't share my sweat.
They'll have to kill me
to take over my lands.
The elder is becoming mad.
Go set your stuff down,
and wait for my orders.
Laura, you'll always be by my side.
To share my lands with these work-shies ?!
Batista,
If Dr Getulio Varg still lived,
nobody would dare to
take over our lands.
The guilty about all of that...
Atomic bomb...
There's beautifull women in town.
You should meet them.
To do what ?
You already have one in the neighborhood.
It's not me who says that.
The people are talking, commissar.
Vox populi, vox dei.
Did you learn latin from the priest ?
By the way, the priest
wants me to become the prefect.
What a frightening challenger for me !
What's your political platform ?
The pulpit !
Will you become a sexton ?
I don't have any access to the bed,
or the dinner table of a coronel.
I'm going to be prefect, then deputy.
And then, senator.
I'll find you a good job, with
a regular salary.
Good. I wasn't paid for
the last six months.
No pessimism.
A great economic cycle begins.
I only know the cycle of cocoa.
The cycle of coffee, of gold,
the one of diamond...
The cycle of sugar, of petrol
and of the rubber.
The dollar is the savior
of this country.
Will it save the country,
or its receiver ?
I loved, I loved too much.
I suffered from love
like nobody else
I've cried, and I've lost peace
I know that nobody never ever...
The 'cachaça', you pay it !
My Saint...
The time has come. The time to burn
the living ones and to destroy the town.
I have to fulfill my vow.
For the angels' happiness, and
the people's happiness.
Show respect to God, Captain Coirana.
Respect god and the government.
To respect ?
And who shows respect to us ?
Us, poor wandering unhappy ones ?
Only vengeance shall permit us to
forget the years of suffering.
Without respect.
Absolutly no respect.
It has been proved in the past,
and it will be proved in the future :
the one who fights against the government
shall pay with his own head.
The unhappy cries.
The destiny of poverty is hell.
I want to embark again on my whithe ship...
and sail back to Africa.
My Grandfather's Africa.
Negro Antao,
you are bathing in fear.
You are at the limits of ignorance.
Future lies beyond future.
Not before past.
I've traveled around the world
I've seen the misfortunes of other peoples.
I've learned this Truth from The Holy Book :
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
In 1945,
When Brazil entered the war
in the Far Europe,
it was the dictature of Vargas.
Did Brazil win this war ?
Didn't it ?
For myself, I've lost them all.
By fear and cowardise.
I've even lost the sight of my enemy.
Professor...
Do you see this hand ?
This hand killed many cangaceiros...
And now, I'm alone...
In the loneliness of memories.
I have to find another enemy.
To give a meaning to my life.
I want to see,
if Coirana really is a cangaceiro.
If he exists, professor,
I have to kill him.
My heart
What is the reason for
You to beat so quickly
When he sees you
And my eyes start to laugh
They hunt you, on the street
However
You run away
If only you'd know how sweet I am
And how much I want you
If you knew how much I'm sincere,
you would stay by my side
Come
Come feel the warm
Of my lips
They're seeking yours
Come to quench this passion
which is devouring my heart
Then only
I'll know happiness
The great happiness
"They are more than thousands in debt to me.
"But if I enumerate them all,
The earth will shake.
"I'm claiming for the debts in the
Lampiao's testament.
"A man has to become a woman,
A woman has to ask for mercy.
"Freedom for the prisoner,
prison for the jailer.
"A white veil for the whore
who will marry at the Church.
"Money for my poverty, and
something to eat for my people
"Honor my revendications,
or I'll come back."
Are you of flesh ? Are you of shadows ?
Anwer that, cursed cangaceiro !
I don't believe in your
ridiculous clothing.
"First, tell me your name,
then wear off your disguise."
"Who talk like this is
already condemned."
Open your ears.
I am Antonio das Mortes.
Here to frighten your cowardise,
and to override your destiny.
And I add,
not on brazilian territory,
nor in heaven, nor in hell :
there is no place for
a new cangaceiro !
Be ready, my people !
And look at the duel
between the dragon of cruelty
and the holy warrior.
From Corisco to Lampiao,
no more soul-in-sorrow in hell.
Be ready !
I'm going to end up with your race,
Antonio das Mortes.
Come, I'm waiting,
Antonio das Mortes !
The Piranhas took me !
The Piranhas are devouring me !
Mattos, put an end to these chants !
Put an end to these chants !
I am coronel Horacio,
I order you to stop singing !
Batista, make them stop !
Put an end to that devil chant !
They have to stop,
I'm ordering it !
Laura, put an end to these chants !
They have to stop,
It's an order !
Coronel Horacio is ordering
these chants to be ceased !
I'm like a father to you,
The Garden of the Piranhas is poor,
Look at me,
my clothes, my home...
The government is making fun of me,
by promising food,
money for the poors,
drugs, a doctor...
But nothing comes.
My hands are tied,
I can't nourish all of you.
I'm not the Christ.
I'm a good man,
But I can't do miracles.
Did you hear me ?
Go away, all of you !
Wait, I'll do you charity.
Batista, open the store
and give them some flour and meat.
Remember, it's charity.
Mattos, that's a charitable act,
I'm going to nourish every one,
Batista, open the store
and nourish them,
Say to everyone,
that i'm a good and charitable man,
Flour and meat,
Antonio Conselheiro,
Saint Lourenço
called "Cauldron ",
Saint Sebastiao
called "the Good-looking",
Lampiao,
Antonio Silvino,
cangaceiro and poet,
All from Juazeiro.
Many became mad trying to
change this sertao.
You can't change the creation of God.
This cangaceiro...
Why didn't Antonio das Mortes
exterminate this race.
I'm more confident in Mata Vaca,
Professor...
Did you look at this woman, this saint ?
You already found a cangaceiro.
And now a saint ?
What do you want to do with a saint ?
She remembers me of a young girl
from Pernambouco.
She had slept with
the coronel's son,
and got pregnant.
Then, she sold herself to prostitution.
At the Sao Francisco bay.
She became tuberculous,
then throw herself in the river.
She was devoured by piranhas.
Not even a bone was left.
Requiescat in pace,
Antonio das Mortes.
Antonio das Mortes,
here, before me...
I saw you, black bird.
Falcon, vulture...
Corisco, I'll avenge you.
My brothers, I'll avenge you all.
Captain Lampiao, you were
the governor of this sertao,
I'll avenge you !
Antonio.
We should bring him to the moutains.
If he dies here,
they'll come back.
I don't want another slaughter, nor blood.
Captain Lampiao, Corisco...
The Piranhas are devouring me.
But I'm gonna kill them.
Captain Lampiao, you'll be avenged.
I'll avenge Corisco...
I'll avenge all of you.
I'm gonna kill them.
Antonio das Mortes, I'm gonna kill you.
One day, an endless war will start.
Where did you hear that ?
From the mouth of God.
You, don't use the name of God.
My parents, my grandparents,
they were all saints.
And they all died by your hands.
They did join the cangaço.
And died by your hands.
Today, this people will die
by your hands, too.
If Coirana dies,
the people will die
of thirst and hunger.
My Saint,
I've seen many churches,
but not one patron saint.
I swear I've came here
only for the sake of finding
if a cangaceiro was still alive.
I was sure that Corisco was the last one.
But I don't want to kill anymore.
If I killed your parents,
your grandparents, your brothers...
May you forgive me, my Saint.
The one who murders will be thrown
in the deeps of the sea.
Go away, Antonio.
And on every roads of fire on the world
Ask for forgiveness for your crimes.
Look, Antonio das Mortes
Look at the marks of torture.
I leaved on a rotten truck.
Hoping to find wealth.
Here at the Minas Gerais,
I became a slave.
I was employed
In the forests of the Mato Grosso.
Only the strongs survived.
The weak ones were sold.
Then came the time of revolt and regrets.
I went back on the way to Bahia.
When I reached Juazeiro, I saw...
When I reached Juazeiro, I saw...
an old man,
who wanted to sell his daughter
for 5000 coins.
I took the girl,
and ran away to the sertao,
to the borders of Alagoas
when I reached,
I've seen them both, and I said :
Here are the angels of poverty.
I unearthed
my grandmother's clothes
And gave them to her.
Him, I've named him Coirana,
The venimous snake.
We leaved to wander on the roads,
Together and happy.
The one who murders will be thrown
in the deeps of the sea.
Go away, Antonio.
And on every road of fire on this world,
ask for forgiveness for your crimes.
The dragon of cruelty,
it's you, Antonio.
Everyone in the sertao knows
that under your cape,
you're wearing a gold shirt
which protects you from bullets.
The gold the wealthies gave you
to murder the poors.
Are you fine, Antonio ?
Father...
I have to talk to Dr Mattos.
For the love of God,
Tell him to come here.
You'll never be the equal of my husband
until you have the courage to kill him.
Horacio is more a man than you.
He turned everyone into slaves.
I'm myself in great debt to him.
Did I do wrong when I leaved
the brothels of Bahia ?
When he dies, we will inherit everything.
You promised me to get me away from here.
I'll only be able to change
my life when he's dead.
Laura, I'm not a murderer.
You're the commissar, and you
already killed to follow his orders.
You're only a murderer,
a failed murderer.
When you talked about killing Horacio,
I thought you'll do it.
What's best now ?
To kill him, or not
to have the courage to do it ?
I have something to ask you.
Ask the coronel
to open his store
and to give the rest of his food
to Coirana's people.
And, commissar,
ask him to let these people
settle here,
to let them work the lands.
I did not bring you here
to make such revendications !
Did you think about what I asked you ?
Since I've met these peoples,
I'm starting to feel something in my heart.
And heart has reasons that
we can't explain.
The food of the store is
only to be sold.
And the lands are owned by the
coronel.
God made the world.
The devil made the barbed wires.
If the coronel sinned,
he must pay.
I only ask you one thing commissar.
Go to him, and tell him my revendications.
Let us make a deal :
find the way to kill the coronel,
and i'll do everything you want.
I'll give you more, a small house
to die in peace.
You're and educated man,
but my ignorance is revolting :
I'll only kill the coronel,
If he rejects my revendications.
- So, why don't you talk to him ?
- It's your hand,
It's your hand that did step in my destiny,
you have to go on,
If I've followed a corrupted man,
I'll purificate myself
at the root of corruption.
That's what is life,
God wrote the Truths
with tortuous lines.
You are an unresponsible, Mattos !
Shut up !
I have many experience with mercenaries.
It was stupid to bring a mercenary here !
Laura, tell him...
I know the people from the sertao !
But the mercenaries, they have to
be treated by the whip !
Even Batista saw me talking to him !
Won't you shut up !?
I've talked to him.
Nothing to do about that.
He became mad, he shouted.
He looked like a beast.
He does not understand anything,
and doesn't want to.
Antonio, you're my friend,
Aren't you ?
I allowed you to leave your home...
There, you lived hiding and in ignorance.
Don't you want money, Antonio ?
If you want some, I'll give it to you.
Coirana is dead, don't you understand ?
From a loge, I looked at
your failures, Mattress
People of the Garden of the Piranhas !
Come to see the judgement
of a rare riffraff.
Come to see the protégé of the coronel !
From a loge, I looked at
your failures, Mattress
Shut up, wanderer !
You're just a drunkard,
and you have to show me respect !
Since a long time,
I was searching for my place.
Now, I've found it.
It's at the side of the Saint.
I understand where is the real enemy.
Who is here ?
God bless you...
Mata Vaca!
A true mercenary from the Minas.
Sit down, my son.
Laura, where are you ?
Mattos, you're a poor wretch!
A traitor, an ill dog !
A miserable dog !
I rise you from the mud,
I promess you the prefecture,
Is this how you thank me ?
By sleeping with my wife ?
You spoiled my happiness,
you broke my life !
My friend, Mata Vaca, is here
to kill Antonio das Mortes.
But you'll be the first to die !
You were like my own son.
I would have done anything for you.
That's a lie !
Shut up ! Batista saw you !
Batista told me !
Batista is my friend.
Mata Vaca, bring her here !
They'll kiss in front of the all town.
Kiss her !
I can't see, but
I want everybody else to see.
Mata Vaca, make them kiss.
I've lost my eyes in the sertao !
I can't see.
But the town can see !
Make them kiss, Mata Vaca!
May the people see these traitors !
Make them kiss now, Mata Vaca !
It's the truth.
Batista saw you.
Kiss !
I want the whole town to see you.
Batista, what have they done to you ?
You can't die, my friend !
You promised to get me away !
Save me.
I love you, I swear.
Stop, Mata Vaca!
Batista, where are you ?
Where are you, Batista?.
Mata Vaca, where is Batista ?
What did they do to you, my friend ?
Not only traitors,
but murderers.
You are the lackey of the coronel,
you'll always be his lackey.
Admit it.
You're a coward.
A coward, a coward...
Now, you have to choose.
Die inside, or die outside.
Mattos, take your decision !
Don't worry Horacio.
I'll kill this dog.
Mata Vaca, did you get him ?
You killed him !
Batista, we are avenged.
We are avenged, Batista.
We are avenged.
Then came Corisco
and Lampiao
with leather hat
and a rifle at hand
My Saint...
This cangaceiro is mine.
Let me bury him
at the heart of this sertao.
Mata Vaca...
End that act of Justice.
You must put an end to the pestiferous.
Professor !
the coronel did order to kill
the saint and her retinue.
And Antonio das Mortes disappeared.
We have to make something !
He ordered to kill them.
The coronel ordered to kill them.
We have to do something !
I can't do anything just by myself.
This one's already dead !
We must care about the living ones!
Care about the living !
Laura, protect me
from the devil of obscurity !
Come, Laura.
I dreamed that Antonio das Mortes
was killing me.
Come near me, Laura.
Protect me.
Mata Vaca must come !
Antonio das Mortes is going to kill me.
It's destiny, my Saint,
that did retain my hand.
I've lost my strength.
I'm not good at anything, anymore.
I'll leave !
Get back to the city !
And it's the same misfortune
I'll find there !
We'll keep bearing the suffering.
Brazil !
And one day an endless war...
will start.
Rise from the dust, rise !
Rise from the dust, rise !
I cried, without hiding.
Everyone saw me.
I wasn't the only one to cry.
But rising like I did,
who could have done the same ?
A strong man
does not stay lying,
refusing that a woman
could give her hand to him
He recognizes his defeat
and don't lose courage.
Rise from the dust, rise !
Rise from the dust, rise !
Hundred of old negros died,
they were not working anymore
A bastard named Traz-Ca,
turned and fell behind
dirty-muzzle and Mustache
- his war name -
Satan's brother-in-law
Here came Lampiao
at the gates of hell
A boy, still young,
appeared at the gate
Who are you horseman ?
I'm a cangaceiro,
answered Lampiao
I'm not your guardian, and
not your comrade
You won't enter here,
except if you tell your name
Boy, open the door,
I am Lampiao
Terror for the entire world
This guardian, responsible for the gate
seeing him like this,
didn't ask questions any more
The Negro knows to write,
but can't read
Here, forgiveness has no place
Then the guardian came and said :
wait for me outside
I'm going to talk with the chief
at the central bureau
If he refuses you
depending on what he'll say,
I'll accept you, or not
Lampiao said : make your mind,
who talks lose time
Go and come back, quick,
I won't wait for long
If they let me enter,
I'll ransack enverything
I'll burn the place and then i'll go away
the guardian found Satan
at the saloon
Know my Lord that Lampiao is at the door
And pretend to be willing to enter
Should I let him do so ?
No, answered Satan,
Tell him to go away
There's only riffraff coming in,
I'm furious
I'd like to
drive out half of the ones
that are already in.
Lampiao is a bandit,
a thief of honesty
he wants to spread confusion
why would we encumber ourselves
with such a man
without absolute necessity ?
The guardian said :
Lord, what a disaster !
There will be uprising,
if we don't let him enter
Don't worry, said Satan,
call the negros
Take as many as you need
Hundreds should come, men and women
go to the warehouse, and take all
the weapons you need
Other fellows of Lucifer
should be advised too
The negros came
first, came Fuchico
armed with an old rifle
and shouting to Pea-brain
to bring his whip
and to call Tangença by Maçarico
Then came Cambota,
checking his weapons
Formigueiro, Trupe-Zupe
and Quele came
then Banzeiro, Pacaia,
Rabisca, Cordao de Saia
and finally, Baze
Then came a young she-devil
dressed with fine lingerie
She pushed the fence, and said
that it was some bad times
And that today would be a hard day
She shouted at the Baiana,
that now, it was serious
Then this armed band
went to the camp
With rifles, sabers and daggers
There was negress with her cook knife
and her manioc rammer
When Lampiao saw
this band of armed negros
He said :
It's only in Abyssinia
where we should find such an army
Arms at hands,
the chief of this army shouted :
Everyone on him, my negros !
Antonio das Mortes !
Mata Vaca and a handfull of mercenaries are here,
ready to pour their own blood
to defend their protector.
Listen to me.
I fought against Lampaio,
and against Antonio Conselheiro,
But I'm one of them.
Antonio das Mortes !
Show that you're a man.
Let's fight at the front of this church.
with this coward crowd,
hiding behind windows
and under the beds,
for witness
Antonio das Mortes !
If God helps a criminal
Then he'll help me :
I've shed less blood than you.
Show that you're a man !
Coronel!
The time has come.
The town will open its eyes.
The one who talks
never shed any blood,
But he's ready to shed his own
to avenge the humiliated sertao.
And I'd say like the holy Book :
" An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. "
You truly are the angel of the Pest,
The mad beast I was waiting for.
It could not have been Coirana.
It could only be someone like you,
One of these wanderers,
who came from the cities
to sow the ideas of destruction.
Talk, goon, I'm listening to you.
Professor,
I wanted to say...
We are fighting together,
but not with the same weapons.
yours are political,
mine have to do with God.
Okay, Antonio.
We share the enemy.
You keep all your bravery.
I'll stay in your shadow.
No, professor.
Fight with your ideals,
they matter much more than me.
I want to see the famous Mata Vaca !
Coward, son of an ape !
God, let me end my task.
I'm readying myself to show up before You.
The battle was now lasting since
more than one hour
Dust was flying everywhere
and the negros were crying
Lampiao, even if wounded,
would not give away
Lampiao threw a rock at a dog
But the rock blew up
the window of the store
A fire started to grow
in the cotton reserve
Satan, looking at the fire,
called his men back
All the negros came to him
Lampiao went away, having no more enemies
This day was a great loss for Satan
All his wealth burned to dust
his record book burned,
and all his goods
Lucifer said :
No more horrors,
why such a misfortune ?
I'll have the longest winter of my life !
And now I'm going to end up
that story with Lampaio
This is not my business,
but I give you my point of view
He is not in heaven, nor in hell,
but still is in the sertao !
If you don't believe my story
If you do not trust my honesty
You can write in hell and ask to Satan
If this story is true, or not
Cursed by ten chruches
Rejected by all saints
Antonio das Mortes
Killer of cangaceiros...
