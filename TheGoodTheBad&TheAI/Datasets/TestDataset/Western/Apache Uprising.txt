Still getting even
for the Tucson massacre...
Man, woman, two kids, even
the poor old hound dog.
Well, all we can
do for them now
is bury them.
Come on, bill.
Fools! Jug-headed fools!
Coming out
into apache country
Like they
was taking a ride
Down a city street
back east.
Never learn till
they're dead,
Then it makes
no never-mind.
Bill.
Just saw the sun glint
off a rifle barrel
On that Ridge
over there.
Let's mosey on over
to the horses,
Like nothing is up...
Nice and easy like.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Tontos... the worst kind.
Mean as they come.
Yeah. I've seen them
take a man,
Cut his feet,
and make him
walk on cactus.
That's really
before they begin
to torture him.
Come on! You think
you can take us?
It looks
like they heard you.
They get any closer,
they'll be in our laps.
All right... Now!
That's funny.
I never saw an apache
give up that easy before.
Something besides us
made them hightail it.
What are you doing?
Making sure they're dead.
Well, that one wasn't.
He is now.
Apaches, all right.
That ain't all.
Fifth cavalry
from fort crittenden.
No telling
when he got it.
Those buckos must have
been moving pretty fast
To get this far South.
Looks like they're
working their way
toward apache Wells.
You figure to get
to apache Wells
Before the rest
of these critters?
Well, we can sure try.
Hey, Jim,
take a look over there.
That ain't Indians
making that dust.
It's a detachment
of cavalry.
You want to know why
them apaches lit out?
There's your answer.
The chances are they're
headed for apache Wells.
Think you can put up
with them for that long?
Can you?
I can try.
Halt!
What do you think,
captain?
They could be hostiles.
Hard telling
in country like this.
Howdy.
Howdy.
We're mighty glad
to see you.
Getting to be
touch and go.
I'm captain gannon
on patrol
Between fort rocklen
and apache Wells.
What are
you talking about,
touch and go?
We were bushwhacked
by apaches.
Must have seen you coming
and they took off.
Didn't you
hear the shooting?
That's hard to believe.
We've been riding
four days.
Seen nothing,
heard nothing.
Well, about an hour's ride
west of here,
You'll find
a burned-out wagon,
A common grave,
and some dead apaches.
You call that nothing?
Come on, Jim, let's go.
Where would that be?
Lordsburg.
Since you're headed
for apache Wells,
We thought we might
tag along with you that far.
That is, if you
don't mind.
Just who are you?
My name's Walker,
Jim Walker.
This is bill Gibson.
I'd like to give you two
a little warning.
Just don't try
to panic the settlers
With tales of uprising,
unless you have
ample proof.
Is this proof enough?
Go ahead, open it.
Take a look, sergeant.
It's Indian scalp, captain,
Wrapped
in a trooper's shirt.
Where did you find it?
I didn't find it.
Took it off
one of the apaches
that jumped us.
He was wearing this.
"C troop, fifth cavalry."
Fort crittenden.
Mount up, sergeant.
We're pulling out
immediately.
Now, don't tell me
we spooked you, captain.
You two fall in
at the rear of the column.
I'll want a full report
of your activities
After we reach camp
tonight.
Forward, ho!
Well, all of a sudden
they just took off.
I guess they must have
seen you coming.
Seems like
the army's always nearby
but never there.
Now, bill.
Well, I mean it.
They're never there
when you need them.
Just what does
that mean?
Just like everything
about the army.
That's what I mean,
captain gannon.
Mr. Walker, how long
have you been riding
With that renegade?
He's not a renegade,
he's a friend.
If he seems put out
with the army,
he's got his reasons.
Hmm, I can imagine.
No, I don't
think you can.
Bill was married
to the daughter
of a hopi chief.
Squaw man.
Yeah, I guess
you could call him that.
Same as you
can call colonel
j.M. Chivington army.
You recall chivington's
raid, don't you, captain?
Chivington
went too far.
He took things
into his own hands,
But there was
a court martial.
Yes, but that was
after he killed
A peaceful
band of Indians,
Mostly squaws
and children.
Bill's wife and two kids
were among the victims.
You've killed Indians,
haven't you, Walker?
Yes. To protect my life
and property,
But never like that.
Good night, captain.
Walker...
Were you
ever in the army?
I rode with hood.
I had you
figured as a reb.
Well, that's all
behind us, captain.
I fight no wars
to a lost cause.
So far, we only
have your word on it.
Could be you have
some kind of grudge
Against the Indians
And want the army to
do something about it.
It has happened
before, you know.
Maybe, but not by me.
My chief scout
is joining us tomorrow.
He's been
riding the territory
for two days.
I'll reserve my judgment
until then.
Well, captain, if he's
worth his salt...
He'll tell you
that the Indian war
Has spilled over
into this country.
I'll deal with them
when they come.
I've fought sioux
and Cheyenne before.
I don't think the apache
will be much different.
Captain,
about 100 years ago,
The great sioux
came South to make war
with the apache.
And when it was over,
You could
follow the trail
they took home
By the skeletons
of their warriors.
Now,
that's what the sioux
knew about the apache.
You know what
the word apache means?
It means enemy,
A 24-hour-a-day enemy,
An enemy to anything
that walks on two legs...
Gringo,
Mexican, or Indian.
Now you think that over,
And you get yourself
a good night's sleep,
Because you're
going to need it
Before you get
to apache Wells.
Good night.
Now wouldn't you think
vance could have picked
A better place to meet
Than this flea-bitten
barrio?
The last three days
all you've done
is bellyache.
Why don't you quit
trying to second-guess
A man like vance Buckner?
He's ramrodding
this outfit.
Bartender.
Boy, I'm dry
as this dust.
Bring us a bottle.
None of that bar stuff,
something good.
A big fella
with a scar
'cross his cheek
Check into
the hotel yet?
Sure did.
Came in yesterday.
He's upstairs
in room 6.
Friend of yours?
I just asked you
if he was here.
What do you care
if he's a friend of mine?
I didn't mean anything,
mister.
I was just
making conversation.
Yeah?
Well, don't make none
with me, see?
All right, kid.
We don't need
no trouble.
Henry didn't mean
anything by it.
He just likes
to talk a lot.
Yeah? Then
you talk to him,
And keep your nose
out of my business.
You hear me now?
Come on, Toby.
That's enough.
I don't know what's
bothering you, Sonny.
I don't much care.
Henry, I'll talk
to you later.
O.K., Hank.
All right, Sonny,
on your feet.
You want some more?
Oh, no.
No, I had enough.
You beat me
fair and square.
What do you say
We just forget about it
and have a drink, huh?
Why not?
I never let a fight
Stand in the way
of a drink.
Kid, you could
get yourself killed
Stepping out of line.
This hombre
put his hands on me.
Nobody can do that
and get away with it.
I'm going to tell you
something, vance.
You ain't bulletproof.
A slug
can chop you down.
Someday I'm going
to get tired of your talk
And make you
pull that gun.
That'll be
the last thing you'll do.
He didn't
mean nothing, vance.
He's young. He'll learn.
He better,
or he won't get any older.
Get upstairs.
But, Mr. Buckner,
Who's going to pay
for the damage to my saloon?
I'll make it good.
Figure out the cost.
Get him tended to.
The kid stepped
out of line.
That's all.
I'm standing drinks
for everybody.
Everybody at the bar
on the double!
You crazy,
stupid killer.
Just had
to start something,
didn't you?
I told you
to keep him in line.
You know how he is
when he's mad.
He just goes crazy.
You breathe
out of turn,
and you're dead.
Come on, vance,
what's the deal?
$80,000.
Is that worth
the trip here?
That's better
than $25,000 apiece.
I'm taking
the first 40,000.
Any objections?
Yeah, I got one.
We get the short end
of the stick.
I'm taking half
for setting it up.
O.K. With me.
I got no kick.
Well?
Well,
what's the job?
Noon stage to lordsburg,
tomorrow.
Since when
did butterfield
Start making
their shipments
common knowledge?
You know,
he's a big man.
He knows everything.
Have I ever
let you down yet?
That 80,000
will be there.
Now, between apache Wells
and lordsburg
Is the relay station.
Coach pulls in there.
They change horses.
Passengers get off,
eat, and rest.
That's when
we make our move.
Are you saying
we just mosey in
that way station
And tell them
to reach?
I'm saying you two
book passage
On that stage
for lordsburg.
I'll be at the way station
waiting for you.
Now, when everyone's
relaxing,
We hit them.
I don't know, vance.
That butterfield
don't spare anything
If somebody
hits their line.
We'll be on every
wanted poster
From Santa Fe
to Cheyenne.
Not if there aren't
any witnesses left
To identify us.
You mean
kill them all?
That's going
pretty far, vance.
We don't even know
how many there'll be
on board.
suit you better?
You getting soft, Jess?
No.
Not me.
Just slap leather
and watch them fall.
Killing's about
the easiest thing
there is.
I'm leaving now,
So I can be
at that way station
When that coach rolls in.
I gotcha.
It's up to you
to see he stays in line.
Don't you
worry none.
Oh, I never worry
about anything.
You just sit down
and relax, kid.
You ain't going nowhere.
Well, you heard
the man, Jess.
Take it easy.
We got a lot
of fun ahead.
A lot of fun.
Whoa!
This is our
chief scout
Archie whitewater.
Did you see
anything?
I no say
for sure.
I see mescal pots.
Don't know how long
they been there.
How far west
you ride?
Day, day and a half.
No, two days.
And you didn't see
a burned-out wagon?
I told you.
I see mescal pots.
Nothing else.
No wagons.
No apache.
You must be blind
Or holed up
somewhere and slept
all the while.
What you got to say now,
Mr. Walker?
The time to start worrying
Is when you don't see them.
We'll be ready for them
when they come.
Nobody's ever ready
for the apache.
They'll fight you
on their own terms.
When you and your men
are tired enough
And thirsty enough
And far enough
away from the fort,
That's when you'll
find them.
They'll isolate
the towns.
They'll lead you
into an ambush.
You didn't learn that
at west point.
What do you know of that?
They've never
written a book
worth a tinker's damn
On how to fight apaches.
That's a matter
of opinion.
You'd better
change yours, gannon.
The apache can't read,
But he can
sure kill you.
Sergeant, send two men
out on point.
Have them ride
as flankers.
Yes, sir.
Yo, points out.
If our stage
actually leaves
on time today,
Somebody's likely
to drop dead from surprise.
It'll leave
at noon, all right,
But you got
to understand,
Mr. Taylor,
Things ain't
the same here
As they are
in St. Joe.
Here you always
got the danger
of Indians,
Road agents,
lord knows what all.
Indians, road agents,
and a dozen other excuses.
I'm doing the best I can
under the circumstances.
It's a rough run.
I didn't become
district manager
Offering excuses, jace.
I don't think
our demands
are unreasonable.
But we ain't done
too bad here.
We're getting most
everything through
in good order.
Even
the consignments
on gold and silver
Have been
getting through
With nobody
finding out.
Yes, sir,
and don't forget,
We got
the best driver
In the whole
butterfield
organization,
Even if he is
the orneriest.
You mean Charley Russell?
He's supposed to be here
now, isn't he?
Well, where is he?
It's this sort of thing
I mean.
Yes, sir.
I'll... I'll speak
to Charley.
I guess he's out
hustling up
a fresh team.
Remember,
I'll be on the stage
to lordsburg,
And my report
will determine
a lot of things, jace.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, sir,
Mr. Taylor.
She'll leave
on schedule,
Even if I have
to pull her myself.
Henry.
Oh, yes,
Mr. Taylor.
I'll be checking out
this morning.
Will you
see to my luggage
And have it
at the depot?
Yes, sir.
Sure will.
Mr. Taylor.
You're going to have
another...
How shall I say it?
Passenger.
Oh, who?
Janice mackenzie,
that's who.
Called herself
Hopkins here.
Been working
as a bookkeeper
in the bank,
But somebody
found out
about her past,
And she's
leaving town
On the noonday
stage
By request.
Janice mackenzie.
Well, no matter
what they claim
about her past,
She can ride butterfield,
Same as anyone else,
Long as she has
the fare.
I wonder why
she hid out
In a place like
apache Wells.
Well,
she'll find nothing
but contempt and scorn
In this territory.
Her reputation
goes ahead of her.
And lingers after.
I don't understand
why she bothers,
Unless she hopes to get
the mackenzie fortune
When the old woman
finally dies.
Oh, well.
Her worry, not mine.
I'll take care
your luggage.
Oh, Mrs. mackenzie?
Yes?
My name is Taylor.
I'm the district manager
for the butterfield
stage lines.
I understand
you're joining us
On the run to lordsburg.
That's right.
I'm sure it'll be
a pleasant journey.
Thank you.
Sheriff.
I... i want
a word with you.
Yes, ma'am, Mrs. hawkes.
Ladies.
What can I do for you
on this very fine day?
Your duty as sheriff,
Ben hall,
That's what...
By seeing to it that
that woman
Is on the noon stage
to lordsburg.
She's already been told,
But I kind of hated
to do it.
Did I hear you right?
Best be
watching our tongue
and doing our duty.
Do we make
ourselves clear?
Of course.
Of course,
Mrs. hawkes,
But i... i didn't mean
nothing like that.
I'll see she
gets out of town
Just as you say.
The sooner
the better.
Come, ladies.
Aw, miserable
old biddies.
Sheriff!
Sheriff, look!
Cavalry's coming in.
Look like
they've been shot up.
Mr. Taylor!
Mr. Taylor!
I'm sheriff hall.
What happened?
Captain gannon,
fort rocklen patrol.
Do you have
a doctor in town?
Some of my men
have been wounded.
Hey, Joe.
Yeah, sheriff.
Get them down
to Dr. Turner's office.
Tell me, captain,
What's been going on
around here?
Apaches ambushed us
Lost two men
and my sergeant.
I'm hoyt Taylor,
district manager
for butterfield.
We have a stage
going to lordsburg
at noon.
Just because
you ran into Indians
back there
Doesn't mean we'll
run into trouble ahead.
There'll be a heap
of trouble everywhere.
Captain, this stage
must leave for lordsburg.
You'll have to give us
an escort.
Not all the way.
Say, near the relay station.
We can make it
safely from there.
You can see
our condition.
If you
take that stage,
Do so at your
own risk.
That stagecoach
don't leave,
We're going to be
in a lot of trouble.
We'll lose
a lot of money.
Yeah, but if them apaches
is on the warpath,
I don't aim to end up
toes up to the sun
With a Lance
through my gizzard
for a tombstone.
For that kind of money,
I'd fight every apache
this side of hell.
Come on.
How many would you say,
captain?
According to Mr. Walker
and his friend,
We're in the middle
of an apache uprising.
What you mean,
captain?
What did
this hombre say?
I said
we were attacked
three times by apaches,
Including one attack
on a patrol.
That satisfy you,
friend?
I think we're being
Kind of spooked
by this drifter.
Now, I ain't saying
a few stray apaches
Didn't jump
the soldier boys,
Meaning no disrespect
to you, captain.
We rode in
last night.
Didn't see
any Indians.
Could even be
whites made up
like Indians.
Just like I figured.
Ain't nobody
but fool renegades
All liquored up
with firewater
Would be
crazy enough to
attack the cavalry.
Sheriff, have you
had any warnings
On injuns
on the move?
Why, no.
This is the first word
I've had of it.
Did you get
any of them, captain?
They caught us cold
coming through the pass.
We had to run for it.
Ain't nothing
but buck outlaws
on a tear.
If you'll excuse me,
I'll see to my men,
Have the doctor
take a look at this.
Captain.
Mister...
You sure you telling
this thing right?
Maybe you just seen
a little old bunch of squaws
Ambling by
and got scared.
I know an apache
when I see one,
Especially when he's
trying to gut me open.
I don't think
you know anything.
You seem to be
on the prod, mister.
I don't know
for what reason.
I got troubles enough
of my own
Without looking
for more.
Hey, Mr. district manager!
About that coach now...
We're going to lordsburg.
We got guns.
Know how to use them
in case of trouble.
Y'all still going?
We'll be running late
if we do.
Kind of close
back there.
Little sidewinder
was about to
draw down on you.
He's looking to carve
another notch
in his gun,
But not at my expense.
I'm no gunfighter,
never have been.
Don't think you've seen
the last of him, son.
Hey, Charley!
Jim Walker!
Is that really you?
Yeah!
You still driving
for butterfield?
Yeah,
nigh onto 30 years.
Well, what happened?
Lose your horse
in a poker game?
No, he split his hoof.
Put that old saddle
on this horse.
Come with me.
I got to see jace.
Who's he?
The agent in charge.
Everything's
upside down around here.
The cavalry come in
shot full of holes.
They say apaches
is on the loose.
That shotgun
guard of mine
Chad Benson
Broke his leg
falling down some stairs.
That's mighty
inconsiderate of him.
Yeah.
Old bill Gibson and I
came in with that
patrol.
Bill Gibson!
In a town
full of people?
Where the devil
is he now?
He said after his bath,
He was going
to the palace saloon...
Don't say another word.
Soon as I find out
which way's up,
We'll go over
and have a drink
with him.
That's a deal.
Hey, jace!
Get down off of there.
I want you to meet
a friend of mine.
Jace, this here's
Jim Walker.
Used to ride shotgun
with me on
the old yuma ride.
Howdy.
Glad to know you.
Glad to know you.
Know what
we're going to do?
Close up
at this rate.
If it ain't
Taylor on my neck,
it's Indians.
And I got nobody
to take Chad's
place.
I ain't
driving no stage
without a shotgun guard.
Pardon me, sir.
Could you tell me
what time the stage
Is going to lordsburg?
Ma'am, it's up
to Mr. Taylor
To say when
and if we go.
In case
you haven't heard,
There's hostilities
along the way,
And it'll be
a little risky
to leave right now.
I've just been told
It would be risky for me
if I stayed on.
I wonder why
she's so anxious
To get stuck
with an apache arrow.
You must be new
around here
to ask that.
I'm asking.
Her name's
Janice mackenzie.
Do I need
to say more?
That's
Janice mackenzie, huh?
I knew her husband
Bob mackenzie.
Sold him
some mustangs once.
What sort was he?
Well, he was
a ne'er-do-well,
Backed up
by his mother's money.
Off hand I'd say
Janice mackenzie
Was too much woman
for him.
She ain't done
nothing wrong
To nobody
around here,
But that fat sheriff
Ben hall
And the gossips
in this town,
They're going
to officially
Run her out of town
on the coach.
I ain't driving
no coach
Without
a shotgun guard.
Wait. Since my horse
is crippled,
I'll ride shotgun
with you to lordsburg
For the price
of a ticket.
That does it.
You put his gear
on top of that coach.
We're going
across the street
to the palace.
Tell Taylor
when he makes up his mind
What he's going
to do when,
Come over and get us.
Come on, boy.
* don't you cry for me
* for I come
from Alabama *
* with my banjo
on my knee **
I want you to meet
some friends of mine.
This is, uh...
Uh...
Jim Walker.
Yeah.
Come on. Sit down
before you fall down.
Thank you, miss.
Sit down here, partner.
Well, I guess we're not
leaving tonight.
I couldn't
care less.
How about you, bill?
Right... right as rain,
Charley.
Right as rain.
Another bottle,
bartender!
Bartender,
another bottle!
I ain't the bartender,
mister,
But I'll give you
a little advice.
You better hole up
So them big bad injuns
don't scare you.
Little man,
big mouth.
Big man,
big gun.
You want
to see how big?
Come on, Toby.
We'll wait
at the depot.
Don't give me
no argument.
Remember what
vance said
About starting
another ruckus?
I'm going
to kill him!
You don't watch
your temper,
You'll kill
the whole deal.
I don't understand,
sheriff,
What you want
to talk to me about.
I'll leave when
the stage leaves.
There's some things
I'd like to explain.
If you'd just
come to my office,
I'll try to...
Wake up.
Charley.
Charley!
Huh?
I've been looking
all over for you.
We're leaving
for lordsburg.
Jace is hitching up
the horses
For us to leave
right away.
You going to be there?
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be there.
You still
with me, Jim?
I'm still with you.
Help me get bill
out of here.
Come on, bill,
you silly old man.
Oh, we had fun,
didn't we?
Aah!
Next time you lay
your hands on me,
I'll stick
that hat pin
right through you!
That'll be
a fair trick, lady.
Try and be decent
to your kind,
And you get assaulted.
What's the matter now?
Women like you
are not fit to be seen...
Take care of him,
Charley.
Say it good and loud
So Mrs. hawkes can hear
you're doing your work.
You've been warned
about making trouble.
As sheriff,
I'm ordering you
To leave on
the next stage or I'll...
You'll arrest me?
Don't worry.
I'll gladly leave.
The worst savage apache
on the loose
Is a bargain
comparitivly to most
people I've met here.
You've got no place
in apache Wells.
I'm going to make
an example of you.
You mean I'm not going to
hear you tell me again
That if I'm nice to you
things are going to be
nice for me?
Let me
tell you something.
You lose 100 pounds
and get yourself
a million dollars,
Because that's
the only way
You're ever going
to get a woman.
Danged if the lady
ain't right.
Old Ben couldn't
get into Kate's place
With a full month's pay.
Put an apple
in his mouth,
He'll look like
a roast pig.
Mrs. mackenzie,
we'd better head
for the stage.
Ah, I see Mr. Taylor
found you.
Well, everything's
ready to leave.
Where's your friend?
He's right
behind me.
I already got
his gear on the coach.
Come on.
Hurry it up.
We'll never
get out of here
at this rate.
Help me get old bill
on top.
I'll tie him
so he doesn't
roll off.
Leave him here
and let's go.
He stays, I stay.
It's going to be
mighty rough
and mighty slow,
Going after dark
like this.
We should still reach
the relay station
by midmorning.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah.
You're the one
riding shotgun?
I hope you don't
have to use it.
If you two are
coming along, climb in.
Don't intend
to be here all night.
Mrs. mackenzie.
Careful now.
Gentlemen.
Hold it!
Well, now,
look over there.
Looks like you
ain't leaving town
any too soon.
Hold it!
Hold that stage!
Hyah! Hyah!
Stop that coach!
That man up there
is under arrest!
Hyah!
What you doing,
Looking for Geronimo?
Easier to scoop up
the desert
in a tin pail
Than to
see an apache
When he doesn't
want you to.
Ohh...
What the devil's
going on here?
Who tied me up
like a bale of cotton?
Better untie him
before he gets
sunburned.
Who stepped
on my head?
Think it was a fella
by the name of John.
John who?
John barleycorn.
Sure packs
a mean wallop.
Where's my horse?
Where we going?
Your horse
is in apache Wells.
Next stop is lordsburg.
Now come on!
Ha!
Now, what do I want to
go to lordsburg for?
Hyah!
Can't you
put that thing out?
It's enough to make
a person choke.
Hey, now, friend,
If I put my hands
around your neck
and squeeze,
That would choke you,
too, wouldn't it?
I'll have you know
I'm district manager
of butterfield lines.
Hey there,
Mr. district
manager,
Toby Jack didn't
mean no harm,
did you?
No. Here, have a drink.
No, thank you.
What's the matter,
Mr. district manager,
Our whiskey ain't
good enough for you?
Drink it before
I stick it down
your gullet.
Hear me now?
That's it.
All of it...
Down the hatch.
Hyah!
That's a good boy.
You... you won't
get away with this.
When we get
to lordsburg,
I'll have the marshal
jail both of you.
Hey there, Toby Jack.
What?
We ain't being
polite to the lady.
Here, honey.
How about a snort?
No.
Hey, Jack, I think
you're wasting your time.
She don't want
to be friendly.
I ain't
such a bad cuss
Once you get
to know me.
I'll forgo
the pleasure
if you don't mind.
You can't never tell
How things are going
to work out.
Before this trip's over,
You might just
want me for a friend
More than anything else.
Just you wait and see
how things turn out.
The way
my back's crawling,
Feels like them apaches
Got us drawn
and quartered
already,
And that cargo
we got below,
Excepting for
the little lady...
Hah. They're
a motley crew.
Including Taylor.
I got your Winchester
in the scabbard
if you need it.
Hey, you!
Unlimber your irons.
Looks like we might
have trouble ahead.
Whoa!
Look over there.
By the almighty,
They're falling
out of the sky.
Well, he's
still alive.
He's pretty
busted up.
Wonder what
he was up to.
No good,
bet your whiskey.
Something must have
scared his horse,
And he fell off.
Why bother, lady?
Let the buzzards
have him.
Better yet...
Put a bullet in him.
It's nice and clean.
I would expect you
to say that.
He's just
a stinking injun.
What do you care?
Sure. Why waste
our time?
He ain't no
bother of ours.
Leave him be.
Let's go.
I'm afraid I agree.
Afraid I don't.
What do you mean?
This particular Indian
may be very important
to us.
How?
Take my word.
All right.
We can't
leave him here.
He'll die if we do.
There's no room
in the coach.
I'm not taking
A murderous savage
into our midst.
He's in no condition
to murder anybody.
Help me get him
up there.
I ain't riding
with no lousy
redstick.
Well, Sonny,
You just have
a nice walk.
The way station's
down that way
about 15 Miles.
You can make it easy,
That is, if the sun
don't get you,
Or, uh,
one of his pals.
I said he's not
riding with us.
Didn't you hear
what I said?
Heist him on top
of the coach.
If it's
good enough for me,
It'll do for him.
Redskin.
May I ride with you?
A half-dead apache
is no worse
Than the company
I've kept so far.
You'd better
ride inside.
Gets hot and dusty
up there.
Besides,
if there's trouble,
I wouldn't want you
to get hit with
a stray bullet.
Come on, kid.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Get up there!
Hyah!
Whoa!
Charley!
I thought for sure
Geronimo got you
this time.
That ain't likely.
Well, here we are.
One hour stop
for victuals.
The food here
ain't no good,
And the whiskey
is pure poison.
You trying to kill us?
Sonny, you can walk
to lordsburg
if you want.
Chico!
Chico Lopez!
Last time I see you
was in San Antonio.
How you been?
Fine. And yourself?
I tell you, i...
Chico, take care
of the horses.
That's a devil
of a note
Bringing that injun
in here just like
he's civilized.
It's too bad
the situation
isn't reversed.
You'd look good
staked on an ant hill.
I'd expect your kind
To take up
with an injun.
You open your yap
at me once more,
I'm going
to bat you one.
Toby Jack...
Why don't you just
try batting me once?
Don't! Unless
you think I'll
miss this close.
Drop it back
in the holster.
Outside.
All right,
gunfighter,
I've got
the advantage now,
So we'll even things
up a little bit.
Bill, throw him
your skinning knife.
I ain't no hand
with a knife.
Ain't got no chance.
A lot more chance
than you figured
to give me.
No, but I can't.
You busted my hand.
Too bad it wasn't
your neck.
Charley, keep that till
we get to lordsburg.
Suppose we're
jumped by apaches.
Well, Sonny,
I'll just keep it
for you till then.
You got
anything to say?
Not with that gun
pressing into
my backbone.
Drop it, bill.
How about now?
Nah.
I got no quarrel
with you,
But Toby Jack ain't
likely to forget
what you done.
He'd better not,
'Cause next time
I'll step
on your neck.
You, you
in charge here?
Si, señor, I am
the boss man here,
I think.
This place
is disgraceful.
What does butterfield
pay you for anyhow,
To sit around
and do nothing?
Sometimes nothing
is very hard to do.
If nothing else,
get us some food.
Si. Si, señor.
You're never going
to learn, are you?
You're lucky he
didn't knock your head
clear off.
Why didn't you
lend a hand?
You always said you
never needed no help.
Where the devil
is vance?
Maybe
because we were late,
He figured something
went wrong and took off.
Tell you one thing...
I don't aim to try it
without him.
Here you are, bill.
Chico...
You make the worst grub
I ever ate.
Now get behind the bar
and start pouring.
Charley, you always
say the same thing
about my cooking,
But I notice you had
three helpings.
Ay, caramba!
Russell, take one drink
while on a run,
And it's your job.
I'm warning you.
Oh, I see.
Uh, chico,
make that a double.
As of now,
I quit butterfield.
Mr. Taylor
will drive you
The rest of the way
to lordsburg.
If you intend to
work for butterfield,
You'd better do
as I say.
I don't intend to
work for butterfield.
I quit.
Didn't you hear me?
Well, uh, perhaps
I was a bit hasty.
This has been a most
arduous journey,
What with everything
happening.
What are we
going to do
about the Indian?
We'll leave him.
He'll get along
somehow.
After all,
what did they do
Before the white man
came along?
Probably a great
deal better.
I'd like to get
some fresh air.
Would you
join me?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
I'm beholden to you,
Mr. Walker.
Twice
you've helped me,
And I've not
thanked you yet.
No need.
What are you
thinking about?
How beautiful you are
And yet how sad.
Do you know
who I am
And what they
say about me?
Well, what people say
Isn't really important.
Oh, yes, it is.
You've got to
live with people.
Did you know
my husband?
Yes, I knew him,
But what
I don't know
Is how a woman
like you
Ever married
a man like him.
I met Bob
in new Orleans.
We were married
four weeks later
After a whirlwind
courtship.
There was only
one little detail
Bob didn't tell me...
His mother had
other arrangements
for him.
Her arrangement
was Maria delgado,
Whose family in Mexico
Is as rich
as maude is here.
A wedding was planned...
Not mine.
And by marrying you
He, uh... Upset
the apple cart.
Maria delgado put on
her wedding dress.
She went to church,
Prayed...
And then killed herself
on the altar.
Well...
Sometimes pride
can be a...
A terrible thing.
She was
five months' pregnant
With my husband's child.
Maria's father
and two brothers
swore vengeance,
And maude and I
watched
As they rode up
to the house
And killed Bob
right before our eyes,
And then they rode away
without a word.
In her grief,
She... she turned
against me, and...
Naturally, she didn't
tell the whole story.
She felt that...
That if I hadn't
married Bob,
None of this
would have happened.
Well, by the time
she was finished,
I was a marked woman
in the whole territory.
I bear the mark of Cain
wherever I go.
Then why
do you stay on?
Because I didn't
do anything wrong,
And I will not
lower myself
to that indignity.
Now, she made me run,
And she made me cry,
But no one else
ever will.
There was
an apache war scare.
We was worried
about you.
Where you been?
Up on the Ridge
watching things
down here.
Everything set?
They're all inside.
What happened to...
Where's your gun?
He smarted off again,
And some fella inside
whomped him good,
Took his gun away.
Give him yours.
Get that shotgun.
There's a storm
coming in.
Saw it
from the Ridge.
Hey, I just seen
an Indian up there.
You see anything?
No, I don't
see nothing.
He don't, either.
He just
been drinking too much.
All right,
let's go.
It's about time
we get rolling.
I'll go rustle up
the other two
passengers.
Uh... uh, not yet.
We haven't
been here an hour.
Butterfield always...
Don't anybody move!
Heist 'em high.
I ain't got
no gun, Sonny.
Who is she?
Well, that's
Janice mackenzie.
You've heard
of her before,
And this one here
is the one
That cuffed
Toby Jack around.
How big you feel now?
About the same size
you would
If you didn't
have that Cannon.
I don't know whether
I'll give him to you
or not, Toby Jack.
Oh, shut up.
I'll tell you
what to do and when.
Long time, Walker.
Long time.
You know him
from somewhere?
I know him.
Hey, you.
You run this place?
Si. Si, señor.
What about him?
Found him on the trail.
She insisted
we bring him along.
Say, vance,
This one's been
nursemaiding that bag
All the way here.
What you got there?
Nothing. Just some
extra clothes.
No use playacting
anymore, Taylor.
Give Jess the cash.
Well, Charley,
Looks like
the stage line
Is going to give
Mr. Taylor a bonus
this year.
You mean to say
I've been working
for a crook?
Toby Jack,
you and Jess don't think
I just chanced to pick
that particular coach?
Nothing could be
further from the truth.
Right, Taylor?
Fool! Why did
you tell them?
Why, you mangy toad.
You was with them
all the time.
That's why you wanted
to leave apache Wells
and get here.
My boys didn't know
about you, Taylor,
But, of course, you
didn't know about them.
Well, boy, I sure
got to hand it
to you, vance.
I didn't know
he was one of us.
Do you realize
what you've done?
I'm ruined, finished.
Now I'll have to
go on the run
With you
and those two
Because you talked.
Taylor, you won't have
to run anyplace.
No?
Well, what about them?
Think they'll keep still
Once they get
to lordsburg?
He's real funny,
ain't he?
They don't need you
anymore, Taylor.
Shut your mouth.
Well, it's...
It's done now.
Let's divide
the money.
Those two
are your lookout.
He still don't
get it, do he?
And they don't, either,
And they're going to
be just as dead as...
He is.
No, vance, not...
Not me.
I... i set this thing
up for you.
Without me,
You'd never have
been able to do it.
Look...
I'll do it for you.
I'll kill them!
Every one of them!
Then it won't be
on your head.
I'll be in it
with you!
Please don't kill me!
Please, vance!
Please, vance!
You're next, mister.
Don't get itchy.
Get him out of here.
You see, Jim,
I just saved your life.
That Toby Jack,
he's a mean one.
He wants to
nail your hide
to the wall.
Ha ha ha ha!
I've lived among injuns
most of my life,
Pretty near,
But I'm glad to say
that I've never
seen this buck
Except from a distance.
That's why
I'm here now.
What's he saying?
You have any idea
who that is?
That there apache
Is none other
than antone,
Chief of the tontos.
Madre de dios.
You're lying.
Bet you wish I was.
Chico... What about it?
No! No!
Bill is right.
His people will
burn down this place
And kill all of us
If they know
he is here.
That's
what you meant
When you said
he was special.
There's more than likely
apaches looking for him.
Vance, we don't
stand a chance
With that many
apaches out there.
So, the great hunter
is now the hunted.
Ohh.
Maybe it's a trick.
Maybe they're just
making it up
to stay alive.
I told you I seen
an Indian out there.
I had a partner once
Who got caught by some
of victorio's
mescaleros.
They staked him out
on an ant hill.
They slit his eyelids
And let nature
take its course.
No mescalero living
can match a Tonto
When it comes
to meanness.
Well, that's better.
Vance, I ain't never
seen it this bad before.
Let's get it done
and clear out
while we can.
How far do you
think you'd get
in this storm?
I'd take my chances
with the storm
Against apaches
any day.
Well...
Looks like
you've reached
an impasse, vance.
Those apaches know
antone's in here,
And you know
Tonto apaches
are the worst kind.
They're the meanest.
They'll just wait.
When you
step outside, you
won't get 10 feet.
Keep talking.
You need us, vance.
You need us bad,
And you need us
alive.
Now you've got,
uh, three guns.
Add us to it,
that makes eight,
including the woman.
Wouldn't you say
that stacks up
a lot better?
You'd fight apaches,
that's for sure.
Then me and the boys
would be outnumbered,
And we'd have to fight
you for the 80,000.
Of course you can
always kill us.
Try and
make a run for it...
beat the storm.
Ain't no storm
can keep the apache
off your tracks
Once he's got your scent,
and they got wind of you.
They just trying
to spook us to get
the guns back.
Let's kill them all now
And clear out of here
while we got half a chance.
First, vance, how
about a little favor?
What favor?
This woman.
I want her.
At a time like...
Fella I once knew said
The only way to cure
all the world's problems
Was to do away
with all the women.
He said there'd be
one man like you,
though,
Who'd want to hide one.
Well, miss...
You have a choice...
Your life, or, uh...
Jess.
I'd rather be safely dead.
I guess she sure
set you straight.
You're too damn proud,
But I'll tame you.
You'll see.
Keep away from me.
This ought to be
worth seeing.
She's a hellcat,
Jess.
Think you
can handle her?
She'll be begging me
to save her before
this is over.
What about it?
Think the lady ought
to go with Jess?
You heard
what the lady said.
Now hold on, Jess.
Whoa.
Looks like
our friend Jim here
wants her for himself.
Maybe you better
take it up with him.
I don't think
you can take him, Jess,
Without a gun.
Sorry, Toby Jack,
Looks like I'm going
to have to finish a fight
You started earlier
and never finished.
Now, cool off, Jess.
They're just trying
to have some fun
at your expense.
Hmmph.
Now that was
fair and square.
I sure would have bet
on Jess, though.
You never would've
got him if not
for the whiskey.
Gets in the belly
every time.
Your luck's just
about run out, vance.
One of these days
you're going to have to
Face a man
all on your own.
I just hope it's me.
Vance...
Why didn't you...
Why didn't you
do something?
What for?
You wanted the woman.
So did he.
Ha ha. Jim...
Where'd you ever
run across this polecat
in your travels?
Well, about...
About six years ago,
there was a...
There was
a wagon train
Out of St. Joe,
Missouri...
That was ambushed.
Every man,
woman, and child
was killed.
Well, they thought
the kiowas did it,
So they sent the army
out to punish them.
There was a lot of gold
on that wagon train.
It never turned up.
Gold?
Yeah.
Now you know the Indians
don't use gold,
So one of the relatives
had me investigate.
It seems the, uh...
Wagon master
was strangely missing.
And I bet his name
was vance Buckner.
Yeah.
Well...
It took me almost a year.
I finally caught up
to him and
brought him in.
You... you brought
vance in?
He went before judge
Isaac Parker for trail.
You mean "hangin'"
judge Parker?
Yup.
Well, the judge
didn't hold with murder,
So he sentenced him
to hang.
Now, one of
the kiowa survivors
was in the courtroom,
And he jumped up
and slashed his face
with a knife.
Bill...
You know what
that scar means?
Yeah.
It's the mark of
a two-legged polecat.
Well...
I haven't seen him
since that time.
Naturally, i...
Thought they'd
stretched his neck.
I'll bust out of here
like I busted from jail.
I've never seen anyone
Want a killing
as bad as you.
What's the difference...
You or the apaches?
We're not going to need
you and your friends
To fight off
those apaches.
If they'd been around
here, they'd have
made a move by now.
And just in case,
we've got him.
How much longer
is this going to go on?
What's the matter,
Sonny?
Your spine crawling?
Old man, I want you
to hear me now.
One more time,
and I'll...
You'll what?
Unless he says so,
you can't even
blow your nose.
Why you...
Uhh...
Bill!
Why, you...
Easy, bill. Easy.
I didn't...
Think the little...
Dog had the...
The sand...
To do it.
Someday somewhere
you're going to get it.
Toby Jack,
if I didn't need you,
I'd let him
have you now.
Now you killed him,
you get him out of here.
Chico, help take him
outside someplace.
Now, what's that mean?
He says he knows
how you got that scar.
Says you're marked
for a bad end.
Not as long
as we have him.
Says he knows
he's going to die.
Says they'll kill us.
They might
keep the woman.
They're going
to take you...
And give you to
the women and children.
When they're
through with you...
They're going
to cut your heart out
And feed it to the dogs.
Aah!
Apaches!
What happened?
Where's Toby Jack?
Apaches! Apaches!
Careful, Jess. We're
liable to hit each other.
Shh! It's me.
Aah! Aah!
That was Charley
Yelling, hollering,
and throwing things
around in there.
You stay right here.
Just to keep you
from catching pneumonia.
Come on.
You think we'll ever
get out of this?
Uh, there's...
There's not much
chance of that.
And no matter
what happen...
I'll always be
grateful for today.
You speak my language?
We have antone inside.
We brought him here
To keep the wolves
from feasting on him.
Would you dishonor
your chief by killing us?
What do you mean?
Well, antone is dying.
Would you have him
go to the next world
Owing a debt in this one?
Dying at the hands
of his worst enemy?
The man Buckner
Is holding antone
prisoner in
the way station.
He's the one with
the scar across his face,
The mark of dishonor
for killing squaws
and children.
Watch
as we save antone...
Then burn
down the station
Upon the man
with the scar.
No, wait.
If you try
and save antone,
they'll kill him.
If you try to burn
the station down,
they'll kill him.
I have an idea.
Maybe I can
help save him,
So he can die
among his own people.
Vance! Can you hear me?
My gun's pointed
at your belly.
If I shoot,
you're dead.
Don't be a fool.
Hear me out.
What do you want?
I want to give you
a chance...
A better chance than
you figured to give us.
Your friends in here
haven't got a chance.
Turn them loose...
Unharmed.
You think I'm crazy?
They're my insurance
to get out of here.
Vance!
They'll burn you out!
Do what he says,
vance.
Anything's better
than this.
I can't put them off
much longer!
What's your deal?
Turn them loose,
Throw your guns away,
Come out
with your hands up.
All we'd get
is a rope.
Either way
we're dead.
I'll make the deal.
Take it,
or we kill them.
It makes
no difference now.
All right.
What is it?
We let them loose.
You bring our two horses
This side of the coach.
We keep our guns.
Well, you heard him.
I do not care
about them.
I only care for my chief.
We are agreed.
What about it?
All right, vance,
But then I'm coming
after you...
Alone.
I hope so, bucko.
I just hope you do.
Cut them loose.
All right, you two,
Carry him out.
Oh!
Is that
butterfield money?
Yeah.
Leave it there.
Nothing said about that.
You're coming after us.
You can take it then.
If you think
you can.
Ay, chihuahua.
Gracias, señor.
Gracias.
Chico, get me a horse.
Si, hombre,
como no.
I never thought
I'd see the day
When I'd be glad
to see apaches.
The truce is
only until sundown.
I do not wish to see
any of you again.
Oh, Jim... Jim,
According
to that apache,
You only got
till sundown.
All right.
He's a good one.
Plenty tough in the desert.
Charley,
you take care of her.
Hyah!
Hyah!
All right, hold it.
Come on down.
Why did you not
kill him?
I'll take him back
to town.
The white man's
law'll hang him.
No. He will
stay with us.
Take his horse.
The truce
is till sundown.
Walker!
You're not
going to leave me?
Walker!
Walker!
Walker!
Well, bill won't mind.
He knew every foot
of this territory.
The only place
he ever called home.
Antone died
just after you left.
They picked him up
and rode away.
Stage leaves for
lordsburg in 10 minutes.
You two
still going with us?
Well, it's a start.
