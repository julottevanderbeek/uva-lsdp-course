There are things you
can't talk about.
Things happened in the past.
A long time ago.
But, not being able
to talk about them,
THE DARK VALLEY
How that foreigner found the
road to reach us, nobody knows.
Because here it was lived...
so close to the heaven,
below, we were considered
a half forgotten legend.
But for the people from
here, above was as well.
Who are you?
Greider.
What are you looking for in our village?
Shelter.
You better go back from where you came!
Haven't you heard?
How long you want to stay?
The winter.
A bag won't be enough.
What are you doing here?
The foreigner said that he
wanted to stay in our village,
and none of the children of
Brenner raised objection.
Not even Mr. Brenner, at
first, he said nothing.
Because the foreigner
wore a mirror...
And then they carried the
foreigner to our house.
For the winter?
You will see.
Where is your daughter?
Inside.
Call her!
Let her know him.
Luzi!
- Yes?
- Come to meet the guests.
She is Luzi.
And this is your new tenant.
His name is Greider.
Take care of him.
But not too much.
See you later.
- You can do it alone.
- Luzi!
No, that's good.
- No, I'll do it.
- Please.
If you want to eat something, come. Now.
Do you make photos?
With this box?
And what do you want to photograph?
Our valley?
And seriously you come from America?
Yes.
Is it true that there are Indians?
Yes.
Have you seen anyone?
Really?
Yes.
And why do you speak German?
- My mother taught me.
- And how is she knows German?
Luzi, enough. Stops to ask questions.
These men...
who are they?
The sons...
of Mr Brenner.
The six?
Mr. Brenner has the control
of the whole people
But also take care of us.
Lukas, idiot! Why do you scare me?
Lukas! No, we can't!
Please, Luzi!
Before we get married.
Lukas...
I don't even think about it.
But I must...
Always.
I'd like to work...
to help.
No, it is not necessary
- He is our guest.
- He might cut the firewood.
Always... that he can do it.
Not everyone knows.
The photographs that you do...
what are they like?
- Can I see them?
- Yes, of course.
- What is this?
- Texas.
This is you?
And your mother?
And your father?
Do you have a picture of your father?
No. He died a long time ago.
My father also died.
He perished on the mountain.
Near to my brother.
Due to a thunderstorm...
You don't do it so bad.
You can accumulate it here, on this side.
Later I'll go to the village. If
you want, you can come with me.
What do you need?
A sack of flour, one of oats...
bacon, and white thread.
- Hi.
And I also want sugar.
- How much?
- Two kilos.
And you? What do you need?
Coffee.
It will take a while.
And nails.
We have a blacksmith.
If you have to shoe a horse...
Does the ladies doesn't treat you well?
And Hans said...
That you'll take care of the guest
And what Hans says...
is done.
Is it clear?
Everything is ok.
Has anybody asked you?
Give me a drink.
And pour him too.
I don't drink.
He only watch.
If I invite you to drink, you drink!
Yes...
That is enough! Leave him alone!
But look!
Now you are worried by your guest!
Add it to my account.
The winter is long here.
This isn't a place for you.
Once the snow arrives it will be too late.
You could go now.
In the following days, it
toured the entire valley...
But of what happens in the
inn, he didn't speak again.
If you want something to eat, just tell me.
Thanks.
When the wedding?
Soon.
Before the Immaculate Conception.
I'd like to ask you something.
Could you make me a picture? Next to Lukas?
Yes.
But it must be before the wedding.
Even more snow will fall.
There goes the tree!
With the first snow, they began
to extract wood from the forest.
in which all the men of
the village are involved.
There goes the trunk!
Trunk stopped!
There goes the trunk!
Trunk stopped!
There goes the trunk!
I’m going.
Trunk stopped!
Trunk stopped!
The bell, he has died.
Take him home.
There is a picture. Luzi will bring it now.
I've been with the parish priest...
for the preparations.
He said that the wedding will be anyway.
He has already spoken with Mr. Brenner.
What if we left?
Forever.
And our families?
But what I want, Is you!
Do you think that I don't want?
I love you.
Then do something.
The next day, Rudolf
Brenner went to hunt,
It's when the hungry dams
go down to the valley.
Hey!
Get out!
In the village, it was said
that Mr. Brenner was concerned,
Because... Rudolf had
never been away so long.
the Mr. Brenner' sons went out
in search of his brother.
Prepare me the meal to take away.
In our town, in the valley, only
the Brenner can use weapons.
Don't you know it?
Did you bring it from America?
- Why do you need it?
- They'll come looking for me.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
The truth is, they have known that he
would never get out of the valley.
And, in spite of
everything, Mr. Brenner
Our Holy Father...
must not be forgotten, neither
for one day, nor for one hour.
You know it.
But today, we'll remember a father,
who wasn't so powerful.
We'll remember...
the nice Joseph.
What do you think that he thought...
when his Mary gets pregnant
and he had never lain with her?
He should have felt furious.
And he felt powerlessness.
If he had left to Mary, it
had been understandable.
But he was a devout man...
And he didn't want that the
shame fall back to him.
So, he accepted.
Because he knew that his son came
from someone better than him.
Then, Joseph understood...
that what the Lord gave to
him, it wasn't a sacrifice,
just a gift from heaven.
And what said the Virgin Mary?
"Since He needs me...
and my belly,
I will not rebel.
Because there is someone
who knows better than me...
what is well...
and what is right."
- Amen!
- Amen.
I want to confess me.
Confess you?
Now?
On behalf of the Father... of the Son...
and of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
"May God, who illuminates our
hearts, give you the true knowledge
of your sins and His mercy."
Amen.
I've missed the fifth commandment.
I have killed.
To one, in the forest...
to other, while he was hunting.
Who are you?
You knew my mother.
What happened then,
more than 20 years ago,
How he prevented Mr. Brenner
was lying with her,
In the same manner as with
the others, in the valley.
His parents were going hungry,
when they arrived in the Valley.
They would have been expelled
of the town immediately,
but they should first have the
permission of Mr. Brenner.
The day in which Brenner
said to the parents
what they had to do in the valley...
with the girls
and it was he who decided who
was staying and who was going,
when she heard to
call for the window,
it was her lover, he was
coming to take her.
They believed that paying them,
the innkeepers would hide them,
In such a way that everyone
knew that would happen,
in case of not
fulfilling their duties.
But then, our Lord,
He had mercy on...
others say that, just for a moment,
the devil didn't pay attention.
The punishment of Brenner
turned to others.
She...
Don't touch it!
Come on, move!
Dance!
Dance!
If not, I'll dance with her.
It's my turn!
- It's my turn!
- No, I haven't yet finished!
He's finished!
No! Please! Stop!
Please! Stop! Leave him!
What? What do you want?
Come on. There is still time.
Lukas, no!
Not worth...
Come on!
The woman!
Luzi, take the rifle.
And you, drop them.
Go down from the horse! All. You too!
Move away from the horses.
Luzi... get on!
Away from the horses.
Go, Luzi...
Go.
Come on, go!
You...
I'll kill you.
I swear you.
In your farm.
Tomorrow morning.
At the dawn.
Give me the weapon.
The rifle!
Why do you do it?
Why?
Come here.
This is the first place to look for.
I want him alive!
- Why did you do it?
- Mother!
My god!
They'll come here.
No.
I'll go to see them.
Thanks.
Woman! Go down at once!
Go down at once!
What do you want from us?
Do you want money?
I don't want money from you.
I have something for you.
You like speaking very much about it.
Money.
Pick it up.
Pick it up!
Eat it.
Eat it, I told you!
Come on.
Come on!
No! Please! Enough!
My god!..
Eat it!
- Please! No!
- Eat it!
Eat it!
Eat it!
Chew it!
Run!
Help me!
Help me, please!
Help me!
Help me, cowards!
Enough!
Bastard!
Bastard!
Come on!
Enough! Stand up!
We have for two.
Two times in a row. There are four times.
Stay here.
She was... a beautiful woman...
your mother.
Come here.
So... you are...
her son.
And...
my sons?
Dead.
All of them.
Your...
half brothers.
Please..
Make it fast.
He was nearly to die...
because of the temperature.
But everybody knows that, many people,
had the intention to expelled him...
So in that way, Mr. Brenner have
left his semen in each family.
The spring has arrive
sooner than expected.
That day I told Lukas
that I was pregnant.
Because, at the end, it was
fair, as it has to be.
