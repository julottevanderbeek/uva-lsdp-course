Sure itching to use
that thing again, ain’t you?
Never hurts to be ready.
You're always ready. Put it away.
- You’re nervous, Al.
I wouldn't be if it wasn't for you.
What time are we meeting Barlow?
- Ten o'clock.
Ever been to this place, Plainview?
Nope.
Never heard of it.
I doubt it's got a bank. If it does,
it's probably got $1.30 in it.
Harvest time. A lot of money
changes hands this time of year.
I'm sick of two-bit towns. What's
wrong with places like Abilene?
- Everything.
They have a lot of cash to pay the trail drivers.
- That’s just it.
Where there’s cash, there’s guns.
We're not exactly amateurs.
- That’s why we’re alive. We’ll stay
that way if we stick to small towns.
Your brother's right. Nobody wears
guns in a place like Plainview
except the town marshal.
Moore, bring up the horses.
We'll look the town over
for five minutes.
If anything looks wrong, we'll leave.
The bank's on the right of the
street. Two people work there -
owner and a teller. No guns.
How about the street?
- No guns there either.
A bunch of farmers, mostly. They've
got a town marshal, an old timer.
How about his gun?
- Couldn't see if he was wearing one.
We'll do it the same as always.
Me and Bob work inside.
Hey, Hank!
Good morning, Doc!
- Ready? Let's get on with it!
Morning, Doc, Marshal.
- Cigars here yet?
- Should be this afternoon.
You can't rely on anything!
A few more hours
without a cigar won't harm you.
Don't get philosophic.
You're not that old.
The first two cigars
are gonna be given away free.
Pass the word around.
Sure!
I'll take the white.
- You had white last time.
Do you want 'em?
- No, I don't want 'em.
- Talk, talk, talk!
Martha, good morning to you!
- Coffee's on.
Thank you.
I'm glad Tim's feeling better.
- Thank you, Jack.
- That's fine.
Morning, Jack.
- Morning, Larry. Mr Livingstone.
Hello, Jack. How are things going?
- Can’t complain. Still solvent?
Thriving.
Keep bringing me money every day
and I might stay in business!
Here you are, Mr Wright.
- Thanks, Larry.
Goodbye, Mr Livingstone.
- See you later, Jack.
Morning, Ellie.
Ah! Martha, if I were a younger man
and you weren't already married, I...
Check.
Doc, you're not trustworthy.
You're a miserable, underhanded...
If you can't concentrate, you can't
play. I've told you 100 times!
Reminds me of playing the General.
What general was that, Doc?
- Robert Edward Lee!
It was at Fredericksburg...
- In '62.
Right after you drove back the
federals. It was a wintry Saturday
night and... now YOU'RE in check!
Sis, where do you want these?
Oh - over there please Wally.
How about this
for the bedroom curtains?
- Fine. There go the profits!
I'll get the other two sacks.
- Thank you.
Why is it some people can’t carry
on a conversation without shouting?
How can a man concentrate with that
cowbell jingling every few seconds?
That's why I love to play chess with
you. You're such a good loser!
We'll see who's the good loser!
What's the excitement?
- Pop, how’s my credit?
Your account's pretty big. Two
afternoons of sweeping the store.
He promised, didn't he?
- Sure he did!
Could I charge some candy?
- Sure you can.
I want a peppermint stick!
- All right. You all want peppermint sticks?
I want a liquorice whip.
- All right, Joey.
There.
Pop, what about Wallboy?
- Almost forgot him, didn't I? Here.
Thanks, Pop!
Come on, Wallboy!
Here you are, Mrs Canfield.
Four, five, six dollars
and 75 cents. Thank you, Larry.
Hello, Ralph. How are you?
Don't move.
Except to raise your hands.
Move over.
That's enough.
Sit still, Mister.
Don’t move at all.
That's it.
Come on, Al!
Dead.
Good. They robbed the bank
and they killed Larry.
Look! Here's the money,
Mr Livingstone.
Nice shooting, George.
- It was Jack's shot that did it.
That's right. I saw the whole thing.
Jack took the marshal's gun
and plugged him.
Billy, your dad shot a bank bandit!
Yeah!
Carry him into the jail.
What a shot! It must be 50,
I never thought he could
handle a gun like that!
Come on - sit down, Martha.
Jack. Jack, you're a hero.
We're in your debt, my friend.
That was a great shot.
I missed him three times with
the rifle and I was a lot closer.
Wait a minute. I'm glad I got him
but it was just a lucky shot.
I grabbed the marshal's gun and...
...put a bullet in him from 70 yards!
That wasn't luck.
It was cool, deliberate shooting.
If there were more men like you
and Henderson in the country,
we wouldn't have any outlaws!
"Outlaw shot by local marksman
identified as Alvin Dennis, wanted in Kansas.
"Alvin Dennis, wanted in Kansas
for bank robbery and murder,
"was shot in Plainview yesterday
after he and his gang
held up the bank.
"Witnesses said the first bullet to
hit Dennis was fired by Jack Wright,
"owner of the general store,
from almost 100 yards.
"George Henderson,
another townsman..."
All right. Let's be going.
Where are we going, Bob?
- Plainview.
What for?
- Get us a couple of marksmen.
- What good'll that do?
It'll do me a lot of good.
We all feel sorry about Al.
Yeah, I can see that!
Al knew the chance he was taking.
Yeah...
He knew the chance he was taking
when he busted you out of jail.
I'm not asking any of you to go with me.
He was MY brother, not yours.
Wait a minute.
We're all going with you.
Sure we are.
Bring that paper.
Who's the lucky girl tonight, Wally?
Sally Livingstone again?
Sis, I’m surprised at you!
If I saw her tonight as well
as last night, she’d get ideas!
I thought WOMEN were fickle!
Heaven help you if you meet a girl
like Martha. You'll never get away!
As I recall,
you didn't try very hard.
I fought like a tiger!
Why aren't you at the saloon?
- I didn’t think I’d go.
You and Mr Henderson
are guests of honour.
I know.
- What?
Mr Livingstone's getting drinks for
everyone. Speechmaking too, I bet.
You'd better get over there. Well,
guess I kept her waiting long enough.
She’ll be mad. We can make up. Night.
- Good night, Wally.
Is that true? You and George
Henderson guests of honour?
Yes, but...
- I think you should go.
I don't feel right about it.
Celebrating because I helped kill a man...
- Don’t be silly.
Well, I...
- Every man in town will be there.
They’re proud of you. They should be.
Martha, I...
- Come on. I'll have to teach
you how to act like a hero.
All right.
- Go on. Have a good time.
I'll try.
So I paced it off,
just to convince myself.
From where Jack Wright was
standing to where Alvin Dennis
was leaving town, it was 138 yards.
Every time he tells it,
the distance gets farther!
You're very modest, Jack. I think
you boys can count on a good reward.
I sure could use it!
Dennis was wanted in Kansas, dead or alive.
I've written to the authorities.
- That’s nice of you.
It was my bank they tried to rob!
The least I can do is see you're rewarded!
Even if I have to take it
out of my own pocket!
Walter! Keep everyone's glass full.
I don't want to see a sober man
by midnight!
Drink up! You've earned it!
- I’ve had more tonight
that I usually have in a month.
You can't stay sober at your own
celebration! Come on, drink up!
No point in letting it go to waste!
Good. Must be at least
six months old!
You drink more than
any three men in town
and I've never seen you drunk.
It's an accomplishment,
I'll agree, but a minor one.
Not as significant as knocking an outlaw
off a horse at 60, 70 or 100 yards...
with a handgun.
- Cut it out. You don’t believe it, do you?
No, I don't. But do you?
- How do you mean?
What I said.
- You don’t think I believe it?
I never shot a six-gun in my life.
I picked it up and pointed it.
Pure blind luck.
Nobody believes it.
Keep thinking that way and
you won't get into trouble... I hope.
Having a good time, Jack?
I sure am!
Let's drink to Plainview,
town of law and order!
Have another, Mister?
They're free tonight.
- Thanks. I will.
Listen! In case you've forgotten,
Plainview lost its marshal, God rest his soul.
I nominate to take his place,
the man who used his gun so well,
Jack Wright.
Thanks, boys.
Thanks a lot, but I can't do it.
I can't handle a gun. That was...
I've got a store to run.
That takes all my time.
The man I think ought to be marshal
is George Henderson. How about it?
Gentlemen, now is as good a time
as any to elect ourselves a marshal.
As far as I can tell, practically
every eligible voter in town is here.
Jack Wright declined the job,
so I think we should follow
his suggestion.
How about it, George?
Are you willing to serve as marshal?
I am. I'd be mighty proud to.
All those in favour of George
Henderson for marshal, say "aye".
Aye!
Opposed?...Unanimous!
George, you got the job!
My first official act is to buy a
round of drinks. Then I'm going home
while I can still ride!
George will make a fine marshal,
don't you think, Doc?
Anybody can be a good marshal. Pete
MacKay was a fine one for five years.
In all that time,
he never had to use his gun once.
Until the day they killed him.
Good night, gentlemen!
- Good night, Doc!
Sure you’re all right, George?
You’re welcome to stay at my place.
No, no thanks.
Wife's liable to worry.
Besides, I got half a dozen cows to
milk in the morning and they'd be
mighty put out if I didn't show up!
Want me to give you a boost?
- Oh, no.
Maybe just a little one.
- Ready, marshal?
Oh... Made it!
Come on, Blue. We're going home!
Good night, Jack! Good night!
Night, boys!
- Night, marshal!
George is the happiest marshal
we ever had!
Tonight, anyway!
Your name Henderson?
- That’s right.
The new marshal -
the fella that shot Alvin Dennis?
Yeah.
Who are you?
My name's Dennis too.
Shots.
Give me the paper.
- What?
- The newspaper!
The whole town will be here
any minute!
It's George Henderson.
He's got at least four slugs in him.
Hey, Jack...
Jack.
Look at this.
Jack, don't you worry.
We're with you, every one of us.
Yeah, sure. Sure we are.
Will that be all, Mrs Metcalf?
- That’s all, thank you.
I'll have Wally bring it right over.
- Bye.
That looks mighty fine, Bill.
How's it coming, Wally?
- Finished. Wire staples, just short of
a keg. Shingle nails, a keg and a half.
Fine on everything except tools.
- We could use more wire and staples.
Nearly fence-fixing time.
- I’ll order them in the morning.
Will you take Mrs Metcalf's order over?
- All right.
Those windows are clean, Billy.
Why don't you go outside and play?
What's the matter, son?
Nothing. I just want
to talk to Pop about something.
What is it, Bill?
Pop, I know what happened
to Mr Henderson.
About the newspaper
picture and everything.
The Dennis gang did it, didn't they?
Yes.
Yes, it looks that way.
They're saying that the gang
might come back again... after you.
I don't think there's much chance of that.
The men who shot Mr Henderson are
cowards. He was alone, outside of town.
We live right here in town. There's
hardly any reason to leave it.
We went to the canyon last Sunday.
We might give that up for a while.
I've got a lot of work here, anyway.
But... supposing they're not cowards.
Suppose... suppose they come back into town...
- They wouldn’t dare.
Pop, I'm scared for you.
Most men get scared one time or
another, no matter how old they are.
Usually it's for themselves
but sometimes it's for others.
It's a very kind thing.
Just remember - we're not alone.
We're part of a community.
And they're all on our side.
Here.
It's on the house.
I’m sorry.
- Nothing to be sorry about.
Feel better now?
Yes, but... you should start carrying
a gun. You've got one in that drawer.
It's been in there for years.
I don't think it's ever been fired.
Remember this.
I'm a storekeeper, not a gunman.
But that shot you made...
- I told you it was just luck. Nothing else.
Now, come on. Run out and play.
Pop... do you suppose there'll be
room in this town for another store?
That's what I want to be when
I grow up. A storekeeper like you.
I always figured you could have
this one. Will that be all right?
Sure! Come on, Wallboy!
I still say if they did it
the first time, they'll do it again.
You see the Amarillo newspaper?
George Henderson's picture
crossed out and Jack...
You sound like my wife.
She can't talk about anything else.
MY wife says we should
take our kids and move away.
Do you think the gang
will come after Wright?
I don't know.
I kind of doubt it, though.
I say it's Wright's problem, not ours.
That's not so. He did the town
a favour. It's everybody's problem.
Afternoon, gentlemen. Bartender,
some of the coldest beer you've got.
Marshal, you're a welcome sight...
providing you're not passing through.
No, I'm not.
I'm here to check on a shooting.
The Dennis gang did it. We'd no
sooner elected Henderson marshal...
We've been expecting them back.
- We're glad to see you, Marshal.
Have another beer.
No thanks. Where can I find
your town marshal?
We haven't got one.
The Amarillo office got a letter from
a Mr Livingstone. Is he here?
He's our banker.
I'd better check into the hotel.
- I’ll take you over.
Well, I'll see you later.
I'll tell my wife about this.
Maybe now she'll shut up.
Bob.
About time. We've been here
more than a week.
What do you say?
- Hi.
- I got some news.
Federal marshal's due to leave
Plainview tomorrow.
Sure?
- He's expected in Amarillo tomorrow night.
How'd you find out?
- I walked into his office
and said I was an old friend.
We'll wait an extra day to be sure.
We'll get there at 10...
Get where by 10?
- Plainview. We didn’t finish our business there.
I don't like it.
- Nobody asked you to.
They might be expecting us.
More to it than that.
- What do you mean?
We've got to get that storekeeper.
He killed your brother
and they've made a hero of him.
If we don't keep 'em scared, they'll
take pot shots at us in every town.
They'll do that anyway.
- Not if we keep "em scared enough.
We're still sticking our necks out.
If you want a safe job,
take up bookkeeping.
It might be easier to do it at night.
All right -
that's the way we'll do it.
Hi, Clem. Sorry if I'm late.
- You're not late. What's wrong?
The federal marshal's leaving.
- What are you talking about?
Livingstone told me this afternoon.
If we talk to him, he might change his mind.
Yeah, yeah, sure. Leaving?
I don't understand it!
Who is it?
- We’d like to talk to you.
It’s Clem Clark and Al Ferguson.
Come in, gentlemen.
- Marshal, we understand you’re leaving.
- Yes.
You can’t!
- I have to. I'm writing the last of my report now.
My orders are to return to Amarillo.
- If you have to stay on, that’s up to you.
Yes, it is,
but I see no reason to stay.
What about the newspaper the Dennis
gang left? That was a threat.
Threats like that are pretty common,
but they're only to scare people.
They've succeeded in this town.
All the women are scared to death.
They'll get over it.
If you don't mind,
I'd like to finish my report.
Look, marshal...
would you consider
staying as our town marshal?
We'd pay you more than you get now.
Good night, gentlemen.
...Good night, marshal.
Look, marshal, you have to stay
for a while. We need you!
I'm finished. I came to investigate
a shooting and bank hold-up.
I've written my report.
Now I must go.
You don't understand our situation.
- You’re jittery. So’s everybody else.
You’ll get over it.
In two weeks nothing's happened.
I don't think anything will.
We need some law enforcement!
- Elect yourself a town marshal.
Goodbye. Thanks for your help.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye, Mr Wright.
You're leaving?
- Yeah. Good luck.
- You don't think the Dennis gang'll be back?
We've looked all over
this part of the country.
I doubt they're even in the state.
Take care of yourself.
Give my best to the missus.
- I'll do that.
Bye, marshal!
That's a horse.
No, it's a burro.
- What's a burro?
It's a... well, it's not a horse.
It looks like a horse. Why isn't it?
Because it isn't.
- It's a horse!
I wanna see the horse again!
You kids get ready for bed.
- Let me finish my story!
It's late. Finish it tomorrow.
- Do as you're told, Joey
You too, Cynthia.
Good night, sweetie.
Joey, what's a burro?
I hear the federal marshal left today.
Yeah. That's right.
- What's going to happen now?
Well... elect a town marshal, I suppose.
Who?
I don't know.
We haven't selected one yet.
You know no-one will take that job.
Don't worry about it, Em!
Where are you going?
- I'm out of tobacco.
Don't go to the store tonight, Clem.
Don't be silly! Nothing's
going to happen tonight!
How do you know
those men won't come back?
If they were going to, they'd have
done it. It's been over two weeks.
The marshal's been here
all that time. He isn't here now.
Jack Wright and I are friends.
If he's in trouble...
Trouble? It isn't just trouble.
He's in danger.
Real danger. So is anyone who's
around him. Can't you see that?
You're making more out of this
than it really is.
I hope so. But I'm frightened.
I'm frightened for the children and...
if anything happened to you,
I don't know what I'd do.
All right, all right.
I won't go to the store.
No mail for you, Doc.
- I wasn’t expecting any.
Paper if you'd like to read it.
You ought to learn to play this game.
I'd like to, some day.
- I’ll give you a lesson.
- Not right now, Doc.
You sure got plenty of time for it.
This place hasn't been
overflowing with business lately.
Hello, Mr Wright.
- Hi, Pop.
Hello. How are you, Cynthia?
- Fine, thank you.
- Business or social?
I guess it's both.
I haven't used my credit...
On a day like this, refreshments
are on the house.
- Thanks!
I want a peppermint stick.
- Yes...
Two liquorice sticks.
- Thanks, Mr Wright!
Thought you'd like some coffee.
- Thank you, Martha.
I'd rather have a liquorice whip instead.
- Finish the peppermint stick first
Mr Wright, how'd you learn how to
shoot a gun? Did you practise a lot?
I said it was just luck!
- My dad said your dad's
the best shot in town.
Joe! Cynthia! Get home for lunch!
But we already had our...
- Don't argue, young man. Come on.
I don't know what's
gotten into these children.
They're so disobedient.
Those are the best-behaved children in town.
I've never known them to miss lunch.
Always a first time.
- They must have had it. It’s two o’clock.
They just finished when I went over
there. What's wrong with Mrs Clark?
Nothing. Maybe she forgot.
Hello, folks.
Eddie, your mother wants you.
- Why?
- I don't know. Come on.
Mom said I don't have to be home...
Take off your coat, Billy.
And hang it up.
This never occurred to me before
but I can understand it very well.
Can understand what?
The store’s dangerous, especially for children.
Nonsense. Maybe a couple of women
think so, but they'll get over it.
It isn't just the women. The only
customer we've had in three days is Doc.
I know.
Don't worry about losing business.
It's the only general store in town.
People will have to come in sooner or later.
- I know.
Nice little town we have here, isn't it?
If you change your mind about chess,
let me know. I'll be at the saloon.
All right, Doc.
Martha! It's the reward money.
$2,500.
Nice.
Now, honey...
You always find something to worry about.
Well, there's nothing there. Come on.
All right, Jack.
I'll take it over to the bank.
$2,500. There’s a lot of things
we’ll be able to afford now.
I'll talk to you later.
Hello Jack, how's things?
- Pretty good, Clem.
Clem, your kids
were in the store today and...
What got into him?
- Who knows?
Look at this. The state of Kansas
sent me the reward.
That's nice.
...You want to make a deposit?
Sure.
- Bob will take care of it for you.
Here you are, Mr Wright.
Don't you think
I ought to endorse it?
Oh! I'm sorry. I didn't notice.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
- Thank you...
Hello, Doc.
Jack.
- Hello, Al.
I wondered where you were going,
Clem. Must have been thirsty.
I was. Can I buy you a drink, Jack?
- No, thanks.
I'll buy the drinks today.
I got the reward money. $2,500.
Set them up for everybody, Walter.
Have one yourself.
- Thanks.
What do you figure on doing with it?
For a long time, I've been thinking
about expanding the store.
I might get some of that new
line of farm machinery.
What do you think, Clem?...Mm?
Oh, yeah, sure. Sure, Jack.
It’s 2.30. Time sure goes!
I got to be running along.
Thanks for the drink, Jack.
- You’re welcome.
Sorry.
- That’s all right.
Thanks, Jack.
I'll be seeing you.
- Sure you won’t have another?
- I have to get home.
How about some whisky, bartender?
Sure, Mister.
- A man gets dried out in this weather.
Al?
- Uh-uh.
Don't let me keep you if you've got something to do.
- I have things to take care of. Thanks for the drink.
Doc...
- My hours are 8.30 to 2.00
unless it's an emergency.
You'd better get out.
- Why?
...My wife will bring
the boy in tomorrow. Bye.
You fellas help yourselves.
Keep track of what you drink and I'll be back.
Howdy.
- Hello.
Everybody sure left all at once.
Yeah... You come from far?
All the way from Amarillo. Nice
windy ride, too. Buy you a drink?
I'll buy you one.
Looking for anybody in particular?
Why, no... Should I be?
- I didn’t think you were.
Strange little town. If I was
a sensitive man, I’d be insulted.
Everybody leaving when I walk in.
Even the bartender.
You'd think they were scared of me.
They are.
Me? What for?
It's a long story. In the
first place, my name is Wright.
Jack Wright.
- Pleased to meet you. Bob Alexander.
Jack Wright. That name sounds familiar.
- It should. I’m a local hero.
You don't say?
I'm the man who shot the notorious
Alvin Dennis from a distance of half a mile.
With a slingshot.
Jack Wright. I read about you in
the Amarillo paper. You really him?
I am.
I've got the reward to prove it.
I see why everybody lit out so fast.
They thought I was one of the Dennis gang.
Well... no sense in hanging around
here. Mighty proud to have met you.
Yeah, run along, out of the line of fire.
That's what I'm gonna do.
This ain't my town. What happens
here is none of my business.
Good luck, friend.
Don't you know it's
dangerous in here, Doc?
Sit down.
Nice town, like you said, Doc.
Nice people.
Same as anywhere, I imagine.
No worse, no better.
I don't believe that. What kind
of a country would this be
if people were like this all over?
Maybe you got a point there.
- I don’t understand.
I mean... well, look.
Folks came out here from back east.
Like my grandfather.
Like a lot of people's grandfathers.
They settled this town way out in
the middle of nowhere and had kids.
But still there weren't
too many people.
I mean, everybody knows everybody.
All their problems, worries,
troubles...
Not like in a big city. You know
what I'm trying to say, Doc.
Yes, I do.
I mean, take last summer, when the
whole Ferguson family took sick.
We all pitched in. We got his hay in,
milked his cows, got his wheat crop in...
Nobody stayed away from his house
because they were afraid
they'd catch the sickness.
I was real proud of Plainview then.
You're not proud of it now?
-No.
Not any more.
Seems to me it’s a lot easier
fighting a danger like this than
a disease nobody can see, but...
I guess the sickness
I got's the worst kind.
No cure for it.
Not here, anyway.
When you came in here
a little while ago, you were mad.
But you're not any more.
Jack...
I'm an old man.
They say old men are great ones
for giving out advice.
But I haven't got any for you.
But I want to tell you one thing.
I like you better...
when you're mad.
Did you deposit the cheque?
- Yes.
Took you a long while.
After I left, I went to the saloon.
Felt like I needed a drink.
I ran into some friends. Clem Clark,
Al Ferguson, some of the others.
The minute they saw me,
they started edging for the door.
Even the bartender left.
You were right, Martha. Except
for Doc Lacy, everybody is scared
to death to be near me.
Maybe it's like you said -
they'll get over it.
Maybe, Martha. I don't know.
That's some weather we're having!
Anything else I can do, Sis?
- No, thanks.
Thanks, Sis.
Me too.
Thanks.
Would you like some more coffee, Jack?
No, this is fine, thanks.
Is there any more pie?
- No. Sorry.
Have mine, Billy. I don't want it.
- Thanks, Pop.
I'll get it, Jack.
All right! I'm coming!
Oh, no! Wally!
No, Wally!
Mom. Mom!
Why don't you people go home?
There's nothing any of you can do... now.
Oh!
Mom, don't cry!
Don't cry, Mom, please!
He was just a boy.
He never did any harm to anyone.
Why did they do it? Why?
Bill...
why don't you start
getting ready for bed?
I'll come in a little while.
I'll take care of... everything.
If you need me, just call.
You understand?
Jack...
they thought it was you.
I know.
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness, for his name's sake.
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.
They rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.
Thou hast anointed my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me
all the days of my life
and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord for ever.
Amen.
Any ideas, Doc?
- About what?
Protecting the women and children.
And the men?
- I'm serious. We need a marshal.
Well, hire one! Send to Abilene
or Dodge City for a gunman.
Preferably one with two guns.
Or more!
We don't want a killer.
- We've got to do something.
No! Look out, Pop!
Look out!
Bill!
Bill, it's all right, son.
It's all right.
Bad dream.
You're all right now, darling.
I made some coffee a while ago.
Would you like some?
- Yes, please.
We have to leave here, Jack.
Yes... for a while.
Amarillo has good hotels.
Maybe you and Bill would prefer Dallas.
What do you mean?
I can't go with you, Martha.
But you can! You must!
Sell this place. We’ll go away,
not to Amarillo or Dallas but
to a small town that needs a store.
Maybe we'll go to Oregon or
California. They say the climate...
It's no good, Martha.
You're sending me and Billy away
while you stay and wait for
those men to come back?
What else can I do?
- You’ll be killed!
You don't think our neighbours are
going to do anything to prevent it?
I've got to stay here, Martha.
- Jack, you’re stubborn.
You've always been stubborn but never a fool.
You've never been selfish.
How am I being selfish?
You're only thinking of yourself and
your principles.
- You and Billy...
Me and Billy? Do you care that you
owe it to us to try to stay alive...
instead of committing suicide?
That's what you're doing -
committing suicide for a principle.
I love you more than any principle.
You know that.
But can't you see, Martha...
I must defend my - OUR - right
to live decently and honestly
in a place of our own choosing?
If we don't have that,
we don't have any life at all.
Maybe you're right about one thing.
Maybe I AM selfish.
But I'm not going to spend the rest
of my days running away,
worrying my family may be killed
any time by a bullet meant for me.
I won't do that, Martha.
I mean it.
I wish I could think of words -
brand new words I've never used -
to tell you how very
proud I am of you.
You and Bill can take the stage in the morning.
- We’re not going.
But Martha...
- We’re not leaving.
You can't stay here.
- My place is here with you.
Who is it?
Al Ferguson.
Hi, Al.
- I couldn't sleep.
I saw your light.
Sit down.
I’m glad you stopped in. Drink?
No, thanks. Livingstone's back from
Abilene. He stopped by my place.
He get somebody?
- No. All he found was a couple
of gunmen who soon lost interest.
Maybe he didn't offer enough money.
- They said it wasn't the salary.
Scared of the Dennis gang.
- They sure are.
We've got to find somebody
for that marshal's job!
We'll try Wichita or Dodge City.
We'll find someone.
What do we do in the meanwhile?
We need protection now.
Livingstone had some sort
of an idea.
We'll probably have a town
meeting about it tomorrow.
What took you so long?
What's the matter?
Here.
We got the wrong man.
YOU got the wrong man.
We'll get the right one this time,
I'll tell you that.
Not in the dark.
We're going in the daytime, today,
so everybody can see
what we're doing.
I'm gonna get him. I'm gonna
get him if it's the last thing I do.
And he's mine, no matter
what happens - do you understand?
All you have to do is cover me.
We're not leaving
till that storekeeper's guts
have been shot out.
Hello, Miss Clayton.
- Morning.
Where's Jake? We're having a town
meeting at the saloon.
What about?
- Jack Wright.
We're having a town meeting
in 10 minutes over at the saloon.
Did you get the kindling box filled for Mom?
- Yeah. Can I help you here?
You'd better stay in the back,
like I told you.
I wanna stay with you.
There's a meeting of some kind
going on at the saloon.
There is?
- Nobody told you about it
or asked you to come?
It doesn't matter.
- Maybe they’re trying to
figure out a way to help.
Yes, that must be it, Jack.
- If it is, we’ll find out soon.
Hello, folks.
- Hello, Al.
Jack, we'd like to talk to you over
at the saloon if you're not too busy.
I'm not too busy.
Jack, I...
- It’s all right, Al.
No, wait.
Me and my family haven't forgotten
how good you were to us last year.
I always figured
you'd do the same for me.
Jack, I hope you realise there's
nothing personal in what I say.
I'm speaking for everybody
and we're all your friends.
Nobody will ever forget
what you did for Plainview.
But unfortunately it's created
a problem - a big one.
We've been talking about it for some
time and we've come to a decision.
A unanimous decision...
except for one person.
Jack, we have to ask you
to leave Plainview.
The people who want to kill you
will keep trying. We have
wives and children to think about.
Um... if it weren't for them,
it'd be different -
the women and children.
But we can't watch them every
minute and it could happen any time.
I'm sure you understand.
- Sure. I understand.
Now, there's quite a bit of money
here, from all of us.
It's about twice as much
as the store is worth.
If you need more,
we'll see you get it.
Thanks, all of you,
but I won't need it.
We wouldn't ask you to give up
your business without compensation!
- I said I won’t need it...
because I'm not leaving Plainview.
Gentlemen! Let's have order here!
Quiet, please! Everyone!
Sit down. Now, Jack, listen...
- No, you listen.
What I have to say won't take long.
I was born here.
I've lived here all my life.
I used to think it was a good town.
I don't any more.
A town's only as good
as the people in it.
I'm not staying here because
I like it, or because I'm brave.
I'm scared.
I guess you all know what I mean.
Well, I'm more scared
than any of you,
because it's me, my wife or my boy
that's most likely to get shot.
Why? I'll tell you why.
Because as much as you talk about
being good American citizens, you're not.
You had your town meeting here today.
You decided to do something
for the community - get rid of me.
You think that'll solve
your biggest problem.
Believe me, it won't.
In this country, the people make
the laws and you're the people.
I don't think one of you'd vote
to make bank robbing
or murder legal.
That's just what you're doing -
making them both legal
without voting.
And you know it.
I said I was more scared
than any of you.
But if you take all your little
fears and put them together,
they're more dangerous than mine.
Jack! Jack! Jack Wright!
Jack! I saw the Dennis gang on their
way here, about half a mile away.
Are you sure it's them?
- Looked like it to me.
I haven't lifted anything heavier
than a whisky bottle in years,
but loan me a gun.
No, Doc.
Thanks anyway.
Jack!
Keep Martha and the boy
in back of the store.
Martha, Billy. Come quickly.
Hold it! Drop your guns!
All of you! We're ready to shoot!
Drop your guns and surrender! You're
all covered! Get your hands up!
Stay where you are!
We’ve got you covered! Don’t move!
Get your hands up!
Up!
Thanks, Doc.
Get down off those horses!
Jack. The things you told us -
every one of them's true.
We were wrong. We're ashamed.
We'd like to ask you
and your family to forgive us.
