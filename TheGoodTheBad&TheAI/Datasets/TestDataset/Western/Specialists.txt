How disgusting... how evil...
Throw in the others too.
But we're only children.
Listen here, I don't like people like yourselves.
The only thing that matters to me is whether
you have enough money to buy your lives.
Let's try this... here is a dollar,
I will lend it to you.
Whoever brings it back to me good for them,
who doesn't well... it'll be worse for them!
This is mine.
Smile!
Thank you sir.
Continue to drink...
...I get nervous when someone stops drinking...
...and when I get nervous, I shoot!
You belong to El Diablo's bandits
and you're very stupid.
You should always inspect a building
before indulging in it!
Romero... where are you?
Stay calm... I'm going to deal with your friends...
Go on... outside.
It's Hud. The great Hud.
Get up...
Go and say hello to El Diablo for me.
Why do you let him go? He's a bandit!
He should be sent to the Sheriff at Blackstone.
He's free until the trial, I know you're 'Specialists'
at this kind of thing!
This is scandalous! Do something someone!
Do something with Hud?
No, I would rather keep my life!
Hello my friend Hud.
You're not my friend.
Listen, if you're intending to go to Blackstone,
watch out for the Sheriff there.
It's no longer allowed to carry guns
after that terrible incident.
It's good advice my friend.
I told you that Hud doesn't have friends.
We're young Hud, we'll come with you,
we'll conquer the world together!
I'm going by myself.
Sheriff, Sheriff... come quick.
They're all waiting for you, down at the office.
It's just I appreciate that, but the question
is what brings that outlaw here.
And we stupidly allowed you to disarm us.
The most dangerous man in the territory
rides into town and we're helpless.
I just want to uphold the law.
And I'll do it, but I ain't giving your guns back.
I'll protect you like I said,
only your guns stay right there.
I'm the law around here...
...until I quit.
- You and your deputy are all we have.
- What can two men do?
- You and your deputy are all we have.
- What can two men do?
You must not allow Hud to ride into this town.
- The man has a right to go where he wants.
- A man like Hud doesn't have any rights.
We've got the prison in Blackstone. When he gets
here I'll disarm Hud, I said I'd protect you and I will.
You can't disarm that savage. Hud knows more ways
to kill a man than God ever thought of.
Hud doesn't even need a gun.
Sheriff you can't allow him to ride in here.
Look gentlemen I know the story.
You're all running scared.
Charlie was Hud's brother right?
And Charlie was lynched two months ago here.
Brother Hud didn't like that.
But if that's why he's back.
He'll have to kill every man in this room.
Because we're all responsible for
what happened to Charlie.
You and me.
Maybe so but I refuse to let it be said
that I struck the first blow.
McClaine hit him first and that's what
started it all. Let him pay the piper.
Don't you try and lay it all on me.
After Wood here had clubbed him
down with his cane.
Now that's a lie and you know damn well that it is.
And if you want to, ask our lawyer here Jenkins.
He did all the dirty work and that's the truth.
He put the noose around his neck.
You can ask anybody here and they'll tell you that.
You just go ahead and ask.
The Sheriff is right.
You are all so stupid.
Yelling like a pack of wild beasts.
With Hud on his way into Blackstone.
Sheriff we are paying you to defend us.
If you're too frightened, to pitch yourself against Hud.
Then we shall have to turn elsewhere for our
protection.
Protection is the Sheriffs job.
He gets paid for it... badly sure.
But I'm here to uphold the law.
And by God I intend to uphold that law...
...or else!!
You were quite right.
We'd be fools to put our trust in him.
We all know Hud's reason for coming is to find the
cash.
We have the same interest as he.
The same goal... to find the cash.
Hey if you looking for my Pa mister, he ain't here.
What do you want here? I told you my Pa ain't home.
You stay out of here... yes.
What are you looking for?
Who are you?
What right have you got to walk into here, Mister?
You're Sheba, aren't you?
How do you know that?
Come along Sheba, you can help me.
- How long have you been living in this house?
- About three months.
My Pa bought this place after Charlie was killed.
You mean lynched... I reckon!
How many went after him?
He's dead and buried. And they're still alive.
Don't let him find you here.
You little Hussie... I told you never
to talk to a stranger.
Is that clear?
You tramp.
That's mine.
You want to kill me, for a piece of paper?
Hand over that rifle.
And I'm fining you $5.
You know the law... no exceptions.
I laid down the law that nobody has the right
to carry a gun... Sheriff's orders.
You broke the law, so it'll cost you a $5 fine.
It's a good lesson for you.
You've can pay it in installments if necessary.
Or you can spend a week in jail... savvy?
I think you should know that you can't
enter the town bearing arms.
As you may have gathered I like to
see the law respected.
Why don't you just resign yourself
to not visiting Blackstone?
I don't make exceptions.
But if our rules don't suit you, you can
just keep riding on.
What I decide only I know... no one else.
But you know it's not really difficult
to guess your intentions.
Everyone knows the facts about...
Dallas, Yuma, San Antonio, Kansas City,
Oklahoma...
Your gun is famous.
No man could beat Hud in a gunfight.
Then you know who I am?
Everybody knows you.
You ought to what they're saying.
You'd think Satan himself was coming.
Huds coming... the great Hud!
Sheriff do something Hud's here!
However I do believe you'll give me your gun...
...I'm not joking.
Why do you think I'd really come back?
There's only one reason... to find out
the real truth about Charlie.
I want the facts.
I know how you feel.
Soon as you give up your gun, I'll help you.
Prepare the guest room at once. We've got company.
Prepare the guest room at once. We've got company.
So... I see everyone is unarmed?
Eh... Sheriff?
Well nearly everyone...
Come on... move along now.
How have you been Valencia?
I feel like a disaster like this town... Blackstone.
I hope you're here to find the bank's missing dollars.
All my savings were there.
You mean the ones stolen from my brother?
Yes and then they got Charlie killed.
You know the dead don't talk.
Are you here to get his killer? Do you know who it is?
That's right. I'm here for him and everyone else.
And for me too? Don't forget little old me...
Come here winners and pick yourself a card.
Now we put the card in the miracle box and la la la la
...
Own your own mint gentlemen.
making money.
Well... is there no takers?
- Where are all the rich folk?
- They're all at home hiding.
Ever since Hud got back, you'd
think there was an epidemic.
Yeah... an outbreak of yellow fever.
Except me!!
He's like everyone else...
...but I'll tell you something...
When he faced me...
...he put his gun away...
...and left quickly.
Howdy Hud.
Hello Hud, you know me...
I always joke...
Yes... I like to joke too...
...sometimes.
Hey Boot you're like a lost sheep, what are you
waiting for?
A shepherd?...good for you.
Have you seen Hud... Sheriff?
Instead of going fishing you
should maybe go hunting instead.
I'm only interested in tryouts at the moment.
I glad to see you, Hud.
Visiting your brother.
Do you realize that if it wasn't for the sheriff and me
...
...your brother wouldn't even have been buried.
They looked upon him as a bandit.
I gave him my own coffin.
The one that I purchased for myself.
The one with the comfortable head cushion.
It cost me $15... yes it cost me $15...
I hope I won't need it myself.
- Wait a second.
- Yes?
Hello Hud.
I'm really happy to see you.
I'm probably the only one in town to feel this way.
But the sincerity of my sentiments are what's
important.
Friends as always?
I have no friends.
You haven't changed.
Still the same Hud.
Like when we were little... you recall?
You're the only boy who never tried to seduce me.
You've changed Virginia.
You were beautiful and young.
But now you're...
...you're all dried out.
Dried out?
You may be right.
A woman that stops making love does dry out.
You know...
There's no man here worth looking
at... they're trash all of them.
Since my husband's death I've felt so alone...
abandoned.
Abandoned?...you inherited a bank.
Huh... the bank... yes I want
to speak about that with you.
And about your brother Charlie...
...I trusted him you know.
He was to carry the bank's money in secret to Dallas.
I knew that El Diablo was planning to rob us
and I wanted to get the cash out of his reach.
The town people still blame me for that.
I had such faith in Charlie.
I lost everything.
In over three months...
...no one has deposited any money in my bank.
Sad to hear that.
When Charlie returned hurt and with no money...
They accused him of stealing and
you know what tragedy followed...
Since then I have always been lonely. Very lonely.
Hud...
...will I see you again?
Don't worry you will.
Hello there youngster.
My fish flew out of sight down here. Nice of you to
rescue it.
This is my fish.
Your fish... huh... I see you're kidding.
Give me it back now. C'mon.
Can you prove it's your fish Sheriff?
You own all the flying fish I suppose
...how do we know it's yours?
Apache taught the fish to fly. He gave
it to Rosencrantz and he lent it to me.
And I told the kids to hold it...
...so it's sort of everybody's fish.
Am I right?
Or maybe it looks like a fish you once
knew and you're confused... awe.
As you can see plainly, the fish is ours.
And that star you sporting indicates you
keep the law... correct Sheriff?
The law... is the law.
Well I'll be... you really mean what you said?
You must know the old saying...
there's no fool like an old fool.
Kid... you said the wrong thing
...I'll show you...
You gone crazy?
Are you proud of yourself... you old bully.
Alright talk... what are you
'no goods' doing in Blackstone.
- Can I get an answer?
- Okay... we come from Dallas.
...we're looking for gold.
- Whose gold is that?
Awhh c'mon Sheriff everybody knows whose gold.
- Well tell me again then kid.
- The money stolen from the bank in Blackstone.
They say the Sheriff let the bandits get away.
And when he found them again...
...the money was gone.
And when he found them again...
...the money was gone.
You might want us to help you find it perhaps?
Needless to say we'd expect a
reward for helping you to find it.
And for turning the money into you, Sir.
Yes, because Hud might want the money too Sheriff.
I think you've said enough.
You "no goods"...anything to do with
stolen money is my concern, as the Sheriff.
In Blackstone I'm the only law there is.
How do you kids know Hud? Is he a friend of yours?
Hud ain't got no friends Sheriff...
...don't you know that by now?
Sheriff... Sheriff...
Virginia Pollywood wants to see you at the bank.
She say's it's urgent... better get
down there right away.
Here's your lunch kid...
Let's go.
May I come in?
Anybody here?
I'm in here.
What are you doing in the closet.
Why sorry Widow Pollywood I got confused...
...sorry about that.
You expect to find anything? Come in.
No, no, no I thought you were in there.
In my closet? How silly.
Come in.
Do you mind pouring the water, before it gets cold?
Yeah... er
You're sure you don't mind, if we talk
while I'm in the bath?
No... no eh.
Is the water right?
Yeah... imagine so.
What a good dancer you are!
I er... I er... sort of think I'd better wait outside.
Oh no... why must you rush off like that?
I understand... you'd rather be with the boys over in
the saloon.
Men are so lucky to be able to have fun.
Here... Well take it.
Turn around.
I need to talk to you about certain things,
so it may take a long time...
- Would you open the champagne?
- Champagne?
I think you'll like it... it's just arrived from France.
You'll find a bottle over there by the table.
You'll enjoy it I'm quite sure.
You called me to talk about something urgently.
I wouldn't want to waste time.
You never waste time... with a woman like me sheriff.
Permit me to tell you my personal opinion of Hud.
Any stud players here tonight?
Sort of discouraging.
Howdy Hud.
Hud... I've got something to tell you.
El Diablo want's to see you.
He sent around one of his men.
You're to ride into the mountains.
He has something personal to tell you
and that it was very important.
But you won't tell the sheriff?
Only a fool would do it Hud.
What is this stuff? This ain't fit for pigs.
Valencia...
...your whiskey tastes like urine.
I think I'll complain to the sheriff.
He's gonna close up this pigsty.
Don't shoot off your mouth Boot.
They throw men in prison for slander, so don't tempt
me.
I still say your whiskey tastes like urine.
It's a brand that's yours.
Are you sure there's no urine in this rot gut.
You call this whiskey do you?
You talk too much Boot. Beat it.
You're getting on my nerves and that ain't healthy.
Well if you're that nervous,
why don't you take yourself a walk.
We're all friends here.
Man's got a right to kid ain't he?
Ain't no harm in that, is there?
Somebody... someone get the sheriff... hurry.
- Well don't stop sheriff.
- Well you hear that?
- Sounds like a row at the saloon. I'd better go.
- The boy's are being naughty men.
Silly... go on look for it.
Sheriff... what are you doing?
I'm sorry I reached for the soap I thought.
I really think I'd better get down there.
Sorry to rush off widow.
Thanks for the drink.
Right Boot, now we're gonna hear what happened to
Charlie.
You're gonna talk Boot.
- The truth and nothing but the truth.
- I don't know what you mean.
C'mon let's hear it.
Hud, watch out!
What's going on?
Hud, didn't start it Sheriff
Want to explain the cause of all this Hud?
It had better be good.
Hud didn't start it Sheriff... it was self defense.
This ain't self defense... it's a massacre.
- It's you.
- Who did you think it was?
My father.
Why do you still insist on calling him, your father?
Why?..
Have you... killed him?
Tell me all that you know,
you are the only person that I can trust.
I don't know much... the only thing I know
is that when Charlie got killed that night...
Yes... what happened that night?
When my father returned that night...
I heard him speaking with someone outside, I heard
...
"That son of a bitch played with us..."
"That son of a bitch played with us..."
...he must have hid the money"
All I know is that Charlie was innocent...
...he had been set up.
Sheba...
Yes?
I want you to know that what I did tonight was
in defense, not for revenge.
And now what are you going to do?
I don't know.
Wait for me.
I'll show you when you abuse the sheriff!
I'll show you that I'm better than you.
Come out and face me.
Say that you're sorry.
Come out...
So, have you decided?
Come out...
Where are you hiding?..
...are you hurt?
I'm coming in to get you.
Hud.
Hud.
Hud... are you wounded?
I don't think so Sheriff.
How did you do that?
You're under arrest anyhow.
You're advised that anything you say may be used
against you.
You're a fool Sheriff... you know that?
And you're a sidewinding son of a bitching bastard!
It's true... my Ma worked in a kinda saloon in Dallas.
Where do you think you're going?
Going to see a friend.
You've been arrested... now you're mine.
You're going nowhere.
Damn it you're my prisoner... by God... where you
go I go.
Well where's your friend?
Chico write, Today on the fifth day of the summer.
Francisco El Pacoro called El Diablo...
...because everybody thinks he's a devil.
El Diablo has captured the sheriff of Blackstone.
El Diablo has captured Hud too, who was his friend.
But who is now with the gringo son of bitches.
You write...
I've written.
Write so that everybody in the world including
these land stealing gringos know who El Diablo is.
Especially these son of bitches
who are standing there.
Congratulations Hud... you work for these Gringos.
They lynched your brother. And your friend
the Sheriff does nothing to stop them.
And what you do? You kill five of my men and
you spit in face of Romero.
Let me kill him, El Diablo.
You sound a lot better today Romero.
Romero.
Romero... I say who gonna get killed here.
You understand... he's a little nervous.
There... have one back.
That's enough...
If you want to fight you'll do it my way,
not the gringos...
You understand? Sheriff.
The sheriff is afraid, he won't fight.
Chico... this you don't write. But you write this.
The sheriff very strong. El Diablo is much stronger.
He agreed to let the sheriff fight with him.
According to our old tradition...
prepare the gringo for "The Contest".
- Here I am.
- You were supposed to come alone.
The sheriff followed me.
This say anything to you?
What do you mean?
Who gave it to you?
One of my spies told me that someone stole half
a million dollars from Blackstone Bank.
I had my eye on this bank for many weeks.
But these son of bitches, they were here before me.
So I decide to catch the thief.
I'm much smarter than the sheriff
and I find the poor bastard.
He's your brother Charlie.
Half dead, hiding in a cave. Somebody was
supposed to meet him had shot him in the back,.
He'd hid the cash. But when I asked him
where the money was.
He's too weak to answer.
Poor fellow.
That dollar bill... he gave me.
He was finished... dying...
...all I could say was Ave Maria.
Ave Maria?
Yes... Ave Maria.
Yes, his wounds were extreme...
...like those made by an animal... a wild dog.
Those gringos will do anything for money...
...they used Boot to try and get it.
That's a fact.
That's very good, you understand. And all you have to
do is find the money and bring it here.
Okay?
What about the Sheriff?
You're going to find the money
and bring it to me. Good!
What do you make of the Sheriff?
Ha... if he manages "The Contest"
he'll be free to go.
Hey Chico, get him a horse
...Hud will leave and will get us the money.
If he doesn't El Diablo will be furious...
and he will kill the Sheriff and destroy
the town and it will be historic...
...write all this down, Chico.
You're forgetting something...
Me? no, no, no...
What about my gun?
Here's your gun. Remember how we used
to draw on each other?
When we were kids.
You were always faster than me.
Then the Gringo's cut my right arm off,
after an armed robbery.
You went away to play with real guns while I stayed
back to teach my other arm to kill Gringo's...
You went away to play with real guns while I stayed
back to teach my other arm to kill Gringo's...
...and cut off their arms, legs and
something else off too.
Well I'll be... and with just one hand too!
That's right... and don't forget with my left hand.
Do you think you're faster? Hey Hud?
We draw... c'mon.
I ain't hankering to play with toy guns.
Ok now I'm leaving before "The Contest" begins.
Hurry and return, then we'll have our fight.
Good luck Sheriff, if it's true that
you're hard headed then you'll do well.
I'll find you Hud, I'll get you...
You stupid people.
Aren't you going to arrest them?
I can only take orders from the Sheriff.
What are we going to do?
Considering the Sheriff isn't here, we have to decide.
Firstly I think we should nominate a new sheriff.
But we've already got a candidate...
...the deputy Sheriff.
I've only ever been a deputy...
...and now you expect me to be Sheriff.
I happen to have a wife and children.
So let's nominate another.
Him for instance... he's young,
clever and knows everyone.
I honestly don't think it's my line of work.
Even though I don't lack the courage for it.
But of course if Madame insists
I'll do anything for her.
I think the only solution is to send a telegram
to Dallas, for a proper replacement.
Yes I think that's the only way.
We don't need outside help. We shall
deal with our problems, ourselves.
Listen to this...
Let's take his trousers down.
What are you doing?
You know that we like you.
Hey here's Sheba...
We would like to ask you to join us
in our revolutionary group.
We have never asked anyone before.
Here is the fruit...
I would like to join but I can't.
But you're all alone and
you would have us as friends.
- Have a smoke.
- No thank you...
...I can't... I'm a girl!
And what do you think I am?..
You always seem to arrive at the right time.
Hud!!...We were asking her to join our group.
Get out of here...
...or I'll help you to do it...
...get out I said. Get out...
Since you've been away I've been worried about you.
The Sheriff is missing and they say you've killed him.
They say that they will get you
and do what they did to your brother.
Listen Sheba... when time is the Hail Mary?
At Six O' Clock... why?
I'll wait until daybreak...
...come and look.
Wait.
If it's a game... tell me.
Don't worry you'll understand.
Excuse me...
It's Charlie's gun from the photograph, isn't it?
You mustn't use his gun, problems can be resolved
...
...without violence, killing and pain.
I have never known that kind of life.
Maybe it's because you don't
want to know that kind of life.
Words don't count, Sheba...
Only facts do, especially when they are final...
...like death.
Do you want to see me...
...ruined like my brother...
...is that what you want, Sheba?
No, I just want to help you to forget.
You're here early Hud.
An early riser... huh! Well before the sun is out.
It must be a good occasion to visit the dead at this
time.
It's like this... maybe one of them will be happy
today.
Sun's up Oscar.
There used to be a hole in the wall right?
Yeah, plugged it up myself.
That's my job... keep the place tidy.
Of course I get paid for it.
Dig that grave up quick.
Go on hurry.
Grave digging ain't a hurry up job. Relax boy.
What's that... I'll don't remember burying that.
Now that was real smart... hey Hud?
Real smart... You could say TOO smart.
Good work, you got away from El Diablo.
How did you do that?
Trade secret.
Hand me that cash box.
Easy like.
You're making a mistake Sherriff.
I promised that money to El Diablo.
You better give it to him, he ain't gonna like it.
Blackstone Bank it says.
Mistake I made was thinking your brother was
innocent.
I was a fool to trust him.
But all's well that end's well.
Show me those dollars?
You damn fool... why'd you do that?
- Shot him in the back just like Charlie.
- Shut up!!
That bullet proof vest of his saved him.
Run and get the wagon, we'll take him into town.
I swear to God, they ain't lynching
this here prisoner in Blackstone.
Hud... they got Hud.
I'll be. Sure didn't expect him back that way.
Virginia... come back to bed.
And close the window, you'll cool off.
Come Dearest I shall prove I'm the best you've ever
had.
You still haven't had the piece de resistance... you
lucky girl.
Will you stop playing Romeo in a hurry
...get dressed.
Yes my sugarloaf.
Command me and I obey.
Doesn't that assuage your demon heart.
You give us our money.
Ah shut your mouths. Your money's safe enough.
The money ain't the only thing
they're worried about in Blackstone.
- Why don't you give them it Sheriff?
- They ain't going to to have it.
We'll put you up for impeachment I tell you Sheriff...
Get out of here all of you.
As long as I'm upholding the law here.
You do as I say.
Better take my advice and get the hell
out of here while you still can.
I told you you're going to get your money.
What are you coming to see me for.
See your banker.
See the bank I say.
Hud...
...I thought you were dead.
Don't worry Sheba, no son of a bitch
can kill me. I'll be alright.
It's a good thing you're here Sheriff.
We know the law, between us
we'll see it's respected.
Well they demand that you give
them back their money right away.
Yes and they're within their rights.
It's in everybody's interests
I think to return the money today.
No that's not possible.
I must first review the records.
To see if they check.
- Well how much time are you going to need?
- I don't know yet.
A day, should do it. I'll try it done,
as soon as possible, overnight.
Well that's darn nice of you widow.
It's mighty big of you to be so understanding.
I'll send my deputy over to watch the safe for you.
You're such a marvelous man, you know. Thanks.
So manly... hadn't you better talk to them?
Why I guess you're right. I'd better go. So long.
Oh just a minute Sheriff...
...this champagne is for you.
You deserve much more than this...
...please your good health.
How improbable, to think the great Hud
would fall the victim of such a sad situation.
The sooner that pig hangs the better off all of us.
That's the way I feel about it.
When our money's in our hands,
that's when I'll breathe easily.
The money will be safe in the bank.
I still think we should have put our man
with her to guard that safe until morning.
The Sheriff's on the job.
We don't have to worry.
He put his deputy to guard the safe and see
nothing interferes with the widow Pollywood.
Till she'd checked the records thoroughly.
You can sleep tonight boys...
you'll get the cash tomorrow, for sure.
Sheba, you can stay with me tonight if you want?
You should stay, you'll feel safer here.
Made in France
I'd offer you a little, only
I'm not allowed to break the rules.
Seems stupid, cos I'm the one who made the rules.
Yeah... besides that, there ain't enough
here for us both. It's my little reward today.
Hmmm it's bitter. Well I reckon
I just ain't used to champagne.
I never had a real bottle of champagne before.
But I sure got one now.
A whole bottle and all for me. Yes that's something
huh?
Beer's my drink, can't afford champagne
on a lousy $60 a month salary.
But I didn't pay for this...
...a real woman gave this to me.
Yes Sir, now this business is over.
I figure to go over to Tombstone or Dallas and look for
a better job.
Figure I could ask for $80 now.
Or $90! I think I'm worth more than $90...
Hud... wait and see...
...those donkeys can't put you in prison.
After all they can't prove anything.
You ain't done nothing, have you? And besides...
besides I'm on your side. You can count on that.
Hud... want some advice, stop playing with pistols.
It'll get you nowhere.
Better use your brain... no point in killing
...what are you going to do?
And you know what I'm going to do when I get to
Dallas.
First thing that I'll do... I'll go find me a wife.
Hmmm yeah a woman of my own. I'd like to settle
down.
Get us a house. I even thought about kids.
A handful of boys, my own sons.
Have them go to school, become presidents.
Have a Pa without a cent in his pocket... yeah.
Get the Sheriff...
Get the Sheriff... help me!
Hurry up... go and bring the carriage.
Sheriff
Hey Sheriff
Hey...
Hey... are you alright? Wake up.
Woahh... No one will find us here.
Oh you're a remarkable woman Virginia.
You're the kind of woman
you meet once in a lifetime.
Oh sorry...
...Oh you're lovely...
you know what we'll do...
...we'll spread the money out on the ground and
I'll make passionate love to you on it.
- Nothing stupider than a man pretending he's in love.
- I love you I swear, I'd die for you Virginia.
- You're more stupid than I thought.
Yes stupid... stupid... I adore you...
...next to you this is nothing.
All this money and you... I'm yours Virginia,
I'll do anything you ask.
No...
Romero...
It's Charlie's money...
She wanted to burn the money... if you
burn the money than that means...
...it is false and if it is false then that means
that the real dollars are hidden somewhere else...
...do you know where?
- We've got to do something!
- You're darn right we had! We'd better go and find
the Sheriff.
C'mon let's get the sheriff.
El Diablo!!...hid... El Diablo's coming!
Oh God... El Diablo... he's sure to come in
here.
We've got to get out... hurry the back door.
Sheriff... Sheriff... doh Sheriff, wake up!
- They're out there... El Diablo's here!
- - We need some guns... unlock those...
...our guns are locked up.
- Where's Hud?
- Hud's broken free.
- Free???
It's your responsibility Sheriff!
El Diablo greets you gringos!
You sons of bitch bastards!! How could you be so
stupid!
You've all been cheated and by a woman!!
Pablo... all these dollars... take them back.
You can't fool El Diablo. They are all fake.
The real money was hidden by this bitch.
The bitch took you all for a ride... gringo bastards.
But El Diablo, he wants real money.
She's going to say where it is.
I don't torture her... I can't stand violence.
I'll be nice to her... I sure will love her. Then she'll
tell.
She's going to tell us where she hid all of your
money.
She refuse to talk... she's gonna be sorry for it.
Diablo says so!
Romero... Pablo... go on muchachos you are the
first.
Bastards...
He's going out unarmed.
What do you expect there's thirty to one.
What good's a gun?
El Diablo... I'm not carrying a gun... I want to talk.
I ain't got no gun.
I want to talk to you... man to man.
Cos I know you are a man. And I respect you.
I ask you not to inflict this shame upon the own.
There ain't no reason for it. And you lower yourself
doing it.
You're crazy Sheriff. The Sheriff is supposed
to protect the people who are honest.
All you're protecting is this bitch.
If she's guilty of the crime you say, then the law can
judge her.
And the law here's me.
The law is for gringos... but it is not for me.
It is better for us that you talk... because
it's no good, El Diablo get's upset.
My turn now.
Now talk Virginia...
You're about to die.
So talk... and fast.
You tell me where you hid the real dollars.
- What the hell's going on?
- Who's that shooting... do you know?
Why it's Hud, by crikey... he's got El Diablo on the
go.
Come on talk.
The real money, it's in my house... in the stove.
Who killed my brother?
Tell them... Tell them who killed Charlie.
Go on tell the whole truth.
Boot killed your brother... I told him to kill Charlie.
He was paid... he was paid with the money
...the real money.
You bastards... I'm glad I stole it.
Your brother had nothing to do with it
...I used him.
Like I used all these idiots.
I detest them, I hate them, I hate the pigs.
I needed money to get out.
I'm bored with these farm boys and peasants.
Well shoot... kill me. Go on shoot me.
I'm ready to die.
I don't care... get me out of here. Wait...
Damn you.
Hud.
Now we're gonna fight. Like in the old days huh?
Now we've got the same chance.
We find out who's fastest with left hand.
Chico... write... say that this afternoon El Diablo...
...the most greatest bandit in Mexico has killed Hud.
The greatest gringo pistolero of all...
...say that I kill him with
one shot between the eyes.
And write El Diablo is the fastest gun...
...say he leave his money to all of Mexico.
So that the peasants enjoy
their defender's generosity!
...he's gonna write all that!
Diablo...
...Diablo... Diablo.
Chico... you change what I said... not fastest...
...write second fastest.
Look... come here everybody.
What is it?
He's burning our money.
Stop... stop you can't burn that money.
It's our money Hud. You can't burn it.
Please... please don't.
Hud... he's burning the money.
Why did you do that, it's our life savings.
It's not funny.
Lynch him like his brother.
String him up.
String him up like his brother.
- Is he better?
- His pulse feels right.
But he's losing blood.
We must stop the bleeding.
Let's call a doctor.
- Call the doctor.
- I'm afraid the doctor will refuse to come.
I will go.
I will make him come.
Hurry!
Go on!
Go on Faster!
Faster!
You too idiot!
Now that we have arms
we give the orders.
Get undressed fast!
Doctor! Doctor!
There she is!
Come here!
Let me go! Let me go!
Hud now we have guns.
We defy you!
Come to see what we did.
We are not scared of you.
Come here and show us your courage.
If you don't come we will
kill all the town.
We will shoot all of them.
We have Sheba too.
Are you listening Hud?
What are you doing?
Don't listen to them.
Come on. Admit that you're afraid.
You are afraid, right?
Where did your courage go?
I have to go.
No don't go. You must stay here.
You are hurt.
Give me my gun.
To do what? It's empty.
- No! No!
- Shut up!
Come on crawl! Faster than that!
Look Hud!
Shoot!
With his damned jacket
we won't do anything.
