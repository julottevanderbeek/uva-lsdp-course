Previously on AMC’s Hell on Wheels…
- Where you from, boy?
- We're with the railroad.
Looking for a guide to take us
through Indian territory.
You got you a woman there, sourpuss?
- You say you ain't care about me?
- I lie to you.
-I want you to be mine.
Mr. Bohannon. is gone,
you need to do something.
I'm gonna bust him out.
- Going alone through Indian territory?
- Got to.
Don't go. I got a bad feeling.
Lord.
Lord...
Don't take me like this.
Not like this.
Who are you?
Eva, it's... it's me.
Fire!
Fire!
My house!
Fire!
Hey.
Mmm, mmm. Mmm.
Mmm.
Give me that meat.
I done my work. Give me my supper.
Give me my supper.
Give me my supper!
Give me my supper!
That's mine.
Oh...
Ah...
Aah!
Aah!
Did you see her? Did you see her?
Why'd she run from me?
Why'd she run from me?
She was singing in the field.
Did you see her?
She was singing in the field.
She was singing in the field.
Why'd she run away from me?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No! No.
Ow... please!
Ow.
You ain't her.
Who? Please, please.
My name is Charlotte Royce!
The savages attacked my husband
and me on a way to Denver.
Peter's dead, but his
brother's in Cincinnati.
If you can get word, he'll come find us.
- You ain't her.
- No, no!
- Please! Please!
- You ain't her!
Sourpuss?
Well, lookee here.
They said they found a bear killer
out on the prairie,
but it looks to me like they got themselves
a railroad man a long way from home.
Who is you?
Now, don't tell me you've
forgotten old Jimmy.
I pulled you and that Mississippi boy
out of that tight spot with the Kiowa.
Cullen Bohannon he said his name was.
Had himself a sazerac one
time at the St. Charles hotel.
- Bohannon?
- That's right
with the Union Pacific Railroad.
I see him covered in flame.
Oh, that's right.
Now, that was back with the Kiowa.
Bohannon say he freed the slaves,
but he ain't free 'em.
Boy, what's infecting you now?
I don't know. I don't know.
Now, hold on there, sourpuss.
Let's you and me figure this out together.
This here's old porcupine.
He's my father-in-law.
I come here to warn him about some bluecoats
I come across about half
day's ride South of here.
They on the warpath looking
for that white woman.
She mine.
No, she ain't yourn...
Marked up white woman mine.
Mr. Lincoln may have outlawed
slavery in the South,
but these Comanche ain't
never heard his proclamation.
That white woman is white feather's.
She worth more than neither of us has on us.
She worth three blankets and a horse.
That's what she say.
This one? She's worth twice that and a box
of rocks
White father earned her in battle.
- He earned her in battle.
- Mm-hmm.
Do you know what they call you?
Pah duh ah wuh toh kweh nuh.
Do you know what that means?
"Bear Killer."
Pah duh ah wuh toh kweh nuh.
These comanche believe
any man who killed a bear
takes up all her power and magic
and can't be defeated in battle.
If I know these braves,
they fixing to ride on that cavalry tonight,
and they're gonna want bear killer
and all his magic with 'em.
They think you can't be killed,
but I know better.
Fact is, you gonna fill up full of bullets
faster than any of 'em on account
of you only got one good eye.
And that white woman is white feather's.
You got a woman and a baby
girl back in Cheyenne.
Her eyes worth a hundred horses.
We got to get you back there
before you lose what's left of you.
This is a war ceremony,
and these braves is out for blood.
It's best we go before
they realize you gone.
We got to skedaddle, sourpuss.
Come on.
Look, I-I know you got your
noggin rattled real good,
but... but once you see your people,
well, maybe you'll start...
My name is pah duh ah wuh toh kweh nuh.
- I got magic.
- No, no.
Your name is Elam Ferguson.
You a railroad man. You got a family.
You don't belong here.
I earn my own woman in battle.
Son, you go with them braves,
you ain't coming back.
Now, hold on!
You ain't in your right mind here...
Savages in the woods!
Take cover!
Oh!
Go! Go!
Up here! Over here!
Fall back.
Fall back!
Fall back!
Yah!
Aah!
Head north!
- Hah! Hah!
- Yah, yah!
You're a railroad man, right?
You're not a sage. You're not like them.
You should back there
with your wife and baby.
You can trade me
on the railroad.
I'm worth more than three
blankets and a horse,
enough to get you to that
marked up white woman.
What's her name? I know you know it.
- Eva.
- Yes! Eva!
You can sell me and get Eva back.
I am worth something, but only
if you get me out of here.
Please, please.
Please, you can sell me!
You can sell me and get Eva back.
Please! Please, you can sell me!
You can sell me and get Eva back!
Please!
No, you can sell me!
No! No, please!
No!
No, no! No!
No! No!
No! No!
No! No!
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Come on. Come on!
- You're mine!
- I'm sorry!
I'm sorry. You...
- I warned you.
- Killed him!
You killed the trader.
- He was trying to help you...
- Shut up! Shut up!
- And you killed him!
- Shut up!
You're worse than the comanche.
- You're an animal!
- Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
