Narrator: From the
ashes of the Civil War,
Life was tough certainly
after the Civil War.
And you had this vast
continent that was unexplored.
And I think that fostered a
big migration to the West.
But as the US
government pushes the nation west,
former Confederates

In that day, you had to be
somewhat of a bad guy to survive.

They were all tough and
nobody lived very long.
We deploy Custer and
whatever remains of Crazy
Horse and Sitting Bull's war party.
a time when blood is
shed and battles fought
as they fight to
determine the fate of the country.
Kiefer Sutherland: The
West shaped this country in ways
that people either don't
acknowledge or have taken for granted
or have simply forgotten.
It was such a defining characteristic
of America.
You go to hell.
- You first.

Narrator: The story of
the West begins at the end
Mark Lee Gardner: Quantrill's
Raiders were guerilla fighters
They didn't necessarily
fight in traditional ways,
and the way they fought could often
be very savage, very violent,
and their targets could be civilians
as well as military.
We got to go! We got to go!

There they go! Come on!
Get him!

- Can you run?
- No.

Now, say it.
I solemnly swear...
That I will bear the true allegiance
of the United States.
I will bear true
allegiance to the United States.
Narrator: Jesse James is forced
to pledge allegiance
Before he's released, the
Confederacy surrenders
only to find death and
destruction all around.
After the Civil War, the
South was hellacious.
It had been ruined.
And there was a great deal of resentment
of northern
authority, of federal authority.
There were a lot of people
who were mentally unbalanced
Narrator: In the
border state of Missouri,
David Eisenbach: Missouri
is one of the states
that stuck with the
Union during the Civil War,
but had large sectors of the population
that wanted to go with the
South in the first place.
So you had
Missourians fighting Missourians.

You look good, Frank.
You look like shit.
I bet you gave them Union boys
hell, though, didn't you?
It's just real nice to be home.
Mom, I promise you,
Me and Frank will figure out something.
Their father had gone
off to the gold fields
during the Gold Rush and had died there.
Jesse's mother, Zerelda
James, was a single parent,
and I think that
created a very, very strong bond
between her and her children.
Narrator: Still reeling
from his time in battle,
Jesse knows he has to find a
way to provide for his family.
Sutherland: When you think of
Jesse James and those families,
they have been stripped
of everything, they felt,
after the Civil War and
they were gonna come
and take what they
thought was owed to them.
- Jesse: Come here, come here.
- Let's go.
Here, take this.
Go, go, go!
Narrator: But the Union
Army quickly cracks down.
Jesse.
Cover that up.
How you doing?
What's in the crates?
Food,
various sundries.
- You boys hungry?
- Want some water.
- We don't take orders from northern...
- Jesse: Frank!
We got water.
Fresh out of the creek.
Tastes like shit.
Yeah, well, I guess we're used to it.
Search the house. Take it all.
Narrator: Fed up
with the North's presence,
Eric Foner: Jesse James
could not adjust to peacetime.
He was strongly opposed to
what was going on in the South
and in fact viewed the army after the
end of the war as being oppressive.
Narrator: As attacks
from Confederates like Jesse
news travels over 1,000
miles to the east
These just came in.
You're dismissed.

victory for the North,
Abraham Lincoln promoted
Grant to lead the US Army,
John McCain: General Grant is
one of the true military geniuses.
He saw the objective and he
knew what needed to be done.
Narrator: With tensions
rising in the former Confederacy,
Grant is forced to deal with
the South once again.
H.W. Brands: When Grant
took control of the army,
he had to deal with
leftover matters from the Civil War.
Grant understood that
there was a feeling in the South
that this defeat was
something that still might be resisted.
Narrator: Grant knows he can't
let rebels like Jesse James
So he sends more US
troops south to maintain order
Just over a year since the
end of the Civil War,
Narrator: With former
Confederate soldiers like Jesse James

northern authority in the South...
General Ulysses S.
Grant sends armed troops
Brands: During the
immediate aftermath of the Civil War,
military government martial
law was imposed
and Union soldiers were in occupation
of much of the South.
It was, from their
perspective, a continuation of the Civil War
in which northerners imposed their will,
imposed their ways on the South.
Narrator: But the

people to grow and to succeed
in ways they couldn't in

Danny Glover: You have
the Pacific Ocean on one end,

It's the whole idea of

The railroads then take the

an uninhabited paradise.
People were lured by this fantastic
sense of opportunity.
You can be a poor
immigrant and all of a sudden
there's an opportunity that you can
get 50 acres and start a life.
That's like winning the
lottery back then.
I mean, it was amazing.
Narrator: But as Americans
begin to head west by the thousands...
they're pushing into

Andrew Isenberg: Crazy Horse
was a very talented military leader
who was the chief lieutenant
of the Sioux in the
northern Great Plains.
Narrator: The land
is sacred to the Lakota
and Crazy Horse feels it's
his duty to defend it.
Redford: Native Americans,

it was protected by steel.
And it was fast.

Karl Jacoby: Crazy Horse,
as a young man, had a vision.
And in this vision he sees
that whenever he's in battle,
he's very safe from the enemy and
the enemy can never hurt him.

enemy might do to him.
Crazy Horse sets in

It's obviously a very
risky position to be in

And it exposes the

Grant realizes the only
way to defeat the Indians
is to send his best
commander from the Civil War...

miles away in Texas
Anne Collier: George
Armstrong Custer was very flamboyant.
He wore a signature
costume, if you will,
that he called a uniform.
And he just showed
himself to be superior to others.
Where did you acquire that insignia
on your uniform, soldier?
West Point, sir. Fourth in my class.
Fourth in your class?
Gentlemen, we have a
celebrity in our midst.
Do you know what position I graduated?
Last.
And yet here I stand commanding you.
Why is there a button
missing from your coat?
You're a disgrace
to that insignia.
You are a disgrace to my unit.
And you are a disgrace to
every man who ever wore that uniform.

Make it the end of the year.

Robert E. Lee's surrender.
Lieutenant, why are you falling back?
You breach their
front lines and you push.
Burt Reynolds: A lot
of people laughed at him,
but not in battle.
The thing that
scared people half to death
'cause you were gonna be in
the middle of everything.
Custer has been relegated
to overseeing border patrol
Custer was sent into exile.
And he knew that he
needed to get back into action.
Sir.

him the opportunity
Hutton: Custer got

following the Civil War,

uprising in Missouri.
Jesse: All right, boys, I'll
tell you what's going to happen.
Get around that counter, easy money.
Narrator: Until now,
Jesse's crimes have been small.
But as the North's postwar domination
of the South continues...
He decides that the best way to
express his hatred for the North
In the first 80 years
of America's existence,
there was not a
single armed bank robbery.
So at the time, banks
have minimal security.
Rob a bank and you're stealing
northern wealth.
Sutherland: Jesse
James wanted the money,
but he had a real
statement he was trying to make
that was as much political as
it was about robbing banks.
Go.
- Everything in your vault.
-
Open the vault.
- Move.
-
- Open the vault.
- Jesse: Hold on, hold on.
In the corner now.
I know you.
- I didn't.
- You did.
You fought for the Union, didn't you?
No.
Let's open the vault, be on our way.
- You fought at Richmond.
- No, I didn't.
- Don't you shake your head at me.
- Jesse.
You're the man who shot Bill Anderson.
Seeing death every day
changes the way you look at life.
for the murderer of his
leader during the Civil War.
I found you, you son of a bitch.
We still need him to open the vault.
Bill Anderson was my friend.
God damn it, Jesse. On the floor!
When Jesse fires that gun,
there's a welled-up bitterness
that's been boiling for years.
He still has the memories he witnessed
personally during the war.
Jesse refused to forget.
Come on, Jesse. We got to go.
Jesse, come on. Come on, now.
Get, boys, get.
Come on.
Come on.
Narrator: Jesse
James has just pulled off
one of the first bank
robberies in America,

earning the ex-Confederate
A lot of the guys who became outlaws,

of continuing the
fight of the Confederacy.
Narrator: The crime makes
headlines across the state,
All right, it's on you, Frank.
There it is.
It's a good day to be
Frank James, you know.
Sutherland: Jesse James certainly
had a very specific idea.
He was going to take
the money that he felt
was taken from him during the Civil War.
And once they started reading
their own stuff,
they were, "Yeah, I'm
right. You know, I was questioning
whether or not I should have robbed
that bank, but now I know I'm right."
Jesse James is fanning the
flames of rebellion in the South.
the US government is
dealing with an even greater problem
as Indian attacks by
warriors like Crazy Horse
But General Ulysses S.
Grant has an answer...
Grant was quite happy with
the performance of Custer.
Custer was one of the great
heroes during the Civil War.
He was also willing to
do whatever was necessary
to deal with the Indian issue right now.
Narrator: For
Custer, it's the opportunity
he's been waiting for to
step back into the spotlight.
For months, Custer has
been hunting bands of Indians
Halt!
Gardner: I think Custer
had the same ambitions
that any long-term military
officer had.
That was to advance in rank.
Advance in rank and to
win laurels, win glory.
That was hard to do in
the post-Civil War West.
I mean, you weren't
meeting a foe that was lined up
with 10,000 men on the field of battle.
You were meeting a very elusive foe.
with what he wanted to do,
and I think he wanted glory.
Narrator: Finally,
Custer catches a break.
His regiment discovers a
band of Cheyenne Indians
suspected of
attacking settlers and troops.
Get the men ready.
Half an hour.
I want to hit them with
everything we've got.
You have your orders.
Yes, sir.
Narrator: Desperate for
another chance at greatness,
Jacoby: Custer is quite
consciously, I think, very aggressive
because he's really
trying to reclaim the glory
that he experienced during the Civil War
Narrator: It's only been three
years since the Civil War ended.
But now with Custer
riding into a battle for glory...
and Jesse James inciting
a rebellion in the South...
America is on the brink of
fighting a two-front war.
