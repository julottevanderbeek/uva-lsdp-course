AMALGAMATION AND CAPITAL
- Good morning, William..
- Good morning, M. Bullock.
Are you sometimes permitted coffee?
About a third of a cup?
Completed with cow’s milk.
As to sugar,
three spoons?
Is this the morning, William, do you suppose,
the tip of this lamp,
like a Indian spear,
goes into the top of my head?
I don’t know, Sir.
Does it stand comparison
with your mother’s?
Stiffened with a further
lace of sugar?
I mean that he would make it,
Sir—my father would.
Do you have time to sit a bit?
I suppose I might do, having chopped
the kindling last evening.
Why don’t you tell me
about your father, William?
I didn’t know my brother so well
as you had a chance to.
I was nine when Robert left our home.
I think you knew him longer.
You were 11.
I knew him pretty well.
What did he like doin’ best?
Sometimes he’d sing.
Not army songs, but other kinds.
He would make mother laugh.
He made the best duck calls of anyone.
He would send away through the wood,
and he taught me comebacks,
and feeder calls and hails.
Mr. Utter and I have some camp
bidness to see to.
William,
are you a good duck caller?
I suppose I’m pretty good.
I could show you, Sir.
I know of some potholes over Belle Fourche
way that are pretty good for ducks.
Goodbye, Mr. Bullock.
E.B. Farnum, Al.
Come in, E.B.
I’ve been prostrated
by the agonies of the damned.
Judgment is upon us then.
A molar rotted through.
Distressing me also,
that you are my eyes and ears
and a day as eventful as yesterday
should find you indisposed.
Some solace in knowing I’m missed.
You missed the advent of the
fucking telegraph operator
that had you steered into one of your rooms,
you could have kept tabs on henceforth.
The pain nearly killed me.
As you still breathe amongst us,
I shall ask you to befriend this fuckin’ Russian.
- Russian?
- The fucking telegraph operator, E.B.,
is a fuckin’ Russian.
Of course I’ll befriend him.
I’m very fond of Russians.
And as the trust between you deepens,
we’ll be particularly interested in messages
to and from Yankton.
Yeah? Sorry, E.B.
Al, you might wanna take
a gander at that.
E.B. is leaving.
You won’t miss him.
He’s livin’ at Merrick’s and looks
like the prize at a carnival.
What a delightful image
to carry away with me!
Swearengen’s put the paper man’s boat to sea
with a hold full of fuckin’ bullshit.
He wants 5,000 more upstairs.
Tell that fat bastard he can come
down and get it hisself!
He says it’s 100 if I bring it up.
Is the 5 you already brought him
in any kinda action, Tess?
It’s just for him to look at
while he fucks ya!
So,
do I want my $8.00, Tess,
of the $9.00 he pays for the fuck,
and my 90 of the 100 he gives you
to bring it up to him,
or do I want to give
fat boy the opportunity,
if he has to come down
to get the other five,
to test his luck on the floor here
amongst the games of chance?
- I see.
- And don’t mistake me, honey,
I want to take the time
to explain myself to you.
We’ve come to see Mose Manuel
about his brother gettin’ shot.
Fetch Mose Manual, Tess.
Tell him Sheriff Bullock wants to pay his condolences
here amongst the games of chance.
All these rumors, sheriff,
swirling around you...
How do you keep your hat on?
If you’ll sign right here, Ma’am.
And give us a “A.G.” in the corner.
Is that abbreviation
Is that abbreviation a term of art
in financial transactions?
Ought I acquaint myself with its meaning?
That abbreviation, Ma’am, is your initials.
And by asking the whereabouts of
the currency I signed for receiving,
do I reveal an even deeper stupidity?
The coach from Denver
should get in today.
And the safe we’ve purchased?
To be housed in the bank we’re to build?
It’s inside the coach; as well.
Safe’s inside the coach and
the currency is inside the safe
is the full picture.
There, I did manage to be stupid.
And you will see to the
safe’s temporary situation
at the Star & Bullock hardware store?
Gaze averted from the awkwardness
such a situation generates.
Fixin’ my eyes instead on its
pluses securing your money.
Excellent then, Mr. Ellsworth.
May I further impose on you
to convey this letter?
Of course.
Mr. Swearengen?
Please.
All right.  Is there anything else for us to discuss?
Not at this time.
I’ll be goin’ then.
Who’s that?
It’s Joanie Stubbs.
You’re outside my place.
Keepin’ half-assed vigil after the fact.
Well, come in and tell
me what you mean.
Nah, that’s all right.
Uh, that cocksucker you spoke to me of
come from here last night with a bloody fucking mug.
- I gave it to him.
- Good.
Ahhh…anyways, he told me…
at rifle point
you was okay.
- I am.
- I knew.
if he was lying you was dead
if he was lying you was dead and
feared finding you so in the darkness.
Scared that way since I was small.
Well, come on in, Jane.
If you was alive -
why fuckin’ knock was my thinkin’.
Interfere with you gettin’ to sleep
or - bein’ asleep already -
- Jane, it’s nippy on my twat.
- Alright, then, see you later!
Do you remember you were
in here yesterday?
- Yes, I fuckin’ remember.
- Well, why not come in again?
Maybe I just fuckin’ might.
Nigger General’s got a wild horse on his hands.
I pity the brute beast
I pity the brute beast who pits
his cunning against the Nigger Generals!
We can catch the cavalry
before they head south...
and sell him for $100!
But they want their horses cut!
Where’d you catch him?
I sprung a rope fence behind
him in a box canyon.
He’d escaped the Sioux
but his path crossed an in-season mare’s.
Now, now I can nut him,
but the moon is wrong,
and he’s gonna take it badly.
Fuck, I ain’t losing my chance
at 100 waiting on no fucking moon!
Okay.  Don’t put your ass on me.
Wash him so he won’t fester.
Hey, I got him
All right.  Come here, boy,
come here..
Now, if you want to take it out on someone,
remember
it was very dark-skinned
white folks that cut on you.
They just sounded like
niggers to throw you off.
This one’s a “D.”
And this one’s a “G.”
And what’s the first one?
"D" ?
“Sheriff Bullock declines comment...
...on the swirls of rumors
that parties in Helena...
...with whom he has had long association...
...are keenly interested in annexing...
... our camp to the Montana territories.
‘The Pioneer’ also learns of interest more developed...
...and advanced...
...on the part of Wyoming.”
You knew Cheyenne would
be heard from.
Get the fuck up off them steps!
Here’s where it gets
really fuckin’ busy.
“And of an offer secretly proffered by
certain elements in Washington D.C. ..."
"...to annex to America..."
"...these our beloved hills as a
separate free-standing territory,..."
"...with an eye towards
eventual statehood.”
Makin’ Deadwood fuckin’ headquarters!
Don’t spread your legs
for them just yet, Johnny.
Not with Mexico to be heard from and fucking France.
There.  100 extra copies,
gentlemen, to satisfy
the widened interest I expect
today’s edition may generate.
Wonderful, eh, Mr. Blazanov?
Shall we walk a bit, my American
and Russian friends?
Shall we?
I can’t leave my apparatus.
Are not all of us,
Mr. Blazanov,
tethered in some sense
to our labors?
And at some point in our lives,
is not acceptance
of that tethering discovery of a path to joy?
Don’t know, Mr. Merrick.
And does not the very knowing
we are tethered allow us
in conscience upon occasion,
the rejuvenating pleasures of respite?
Take your walk alone, A.W.,
for I confess
I’m mesmerized by
Mr. Blazanov’s machine
and hope he may explain its workings.
Has Al seen “The Pioneer”?
I don’t know. A mystery
you should seek to solve.
- Good day.
- Good day, Miss.
A.W. Merrick of
“The Deadwood Pioneer.”
- I wish to send a telegram.
- A telegram, yes,
of course.  Then that’s
Mr. Blazanov there you seek.
How do you do?
Blazanov, Cheyenne and
Black Hills telegraph company.
How do you do?
- Miss Isringhausen.
- Mr. Farnum.
- I wish this message sent.
- Oh, of course.
I have a form for
you to write on.
Please.
You seem uncowed
by Mr. Blazanov’s apparatus.
Are you initiate in its mysteries?
Fuck off.
Gentlemen!
Oh, Jeez! Ah, what news?
This ink-stained wretch has just
produced an overrun of 100 copies!
Dan, don’t you agree that the truth,
f only a pinch, must season every falsehood,
or the palate fuckin’ rebels?
And mustn’t the novice chef be mindful
not to ladle out his concoction
by the unseasoned fucking ton,
lest before he perfect his art,
he lose his clientele?
I’d like the ball scores
a little more fuckin’ prompt.
Excuse me.
Al Swearengen, I would not go
into that office if I were you.
Were you fuckin’ born yesterday?
No, Sir, I was not.
I was not born yesterday!
Then may we please have
a conversation as fuckin’ adults?
I think we’d better!
I ain’t waitin’.
Give this to him.
Tell him whatever its import,
he’d best not serve the sender ill.
He’s in with Merrick, E.B.
I bear news that don’t wanna wait.
Every rumor you floated
in your article, Merrick, I believe
is a living possibility for this camp,
and I want you to fuckin’ hear
that as a compliment.
- If so, it’s the first from your lips.
- Because all them possibilities
called next to accomplished
fact in one fuckin’ outgush
makes people smell a rat.
Yes, I suppose so.
These interests comin’ after us,
Merrick, they’re fuckin’ rough.
They’re going after our nuts.
They’re hypocrite cocksuckers,
and the fuckin’ lyin’ tactics
and instruments they use
to fuck people up the ass
can be turned against them.
My newspaper being
such an instrument.
But scale,
amount,
proportion, seasonin’.
Drink that fuckin’
second shot, Merrick!
I like my fuckin’ liquor.
A trait in you that
gave me early hope.
I like stinkin’ of fuckin’ ink too.
- Give it a fuckin’ smell, Al.
- No.
So you enjoyed
writin’ your fuckin’ article, huh?
Worse ways to spend a night,
puttin’ shoulder to a fuckin’ idea.
Evidently, I put mine to overmany.
Pursued down overmany avenues.
The camp’s welfare was the main idea.
Al!  Something strange has
transpired I need you to construe.
What?
- As I was befriending...
- Come in!
As I was befriending
the Russian operator,
that woman tutor
came to send a telegram.
We jockeyed a bit
as I sought a glance at its contents,
and finally, she shouted
in so many words
- and here is the strangeness in a tutor,
to get the fuck away from her.
Since the private part of this
meetin’s over... Ellsworth brung it.
... In so many words.
- Where’s the tutor now?
- Still with the operator,
apparently waiting for
an answer to her message.
Leave by the front entrance, huh?
Walk around for a few minutes
before you go back to your place.
Bring that tutor up here.
The Russian too.
It felt like something
you’d want to construe.
Go away, E.B.
All right. Certainly.
It’s the seeds from the sunflower
we had in Fort Quitman,
which I had in a jar which broke
broke and mice ate most of.
So now I only have these three.
I didn’t know you brought them.
Mr. Bullock’s been missing father.
I talked to him about it this morning.
As Papa like the sunflower,
I thought Mr. Bullock might as well.
Then shall we plant those together?
Press the soil firmly on them,
while I get the watering can.
Maybe we should take
Mr. Bullock lunch at his store.
An accident befell my brother
is the sum of what I know,
and be glad I choose to say it.
Gutshot, at Nuttall’s No. 10
by his own hand?
Correct.
The day you sell out the claim
you two were partnered on?
Correct, and fuck yourself,
and don’t act entitled
to answers.
Why was Charlie handlin’ the gun?
Fuck yourself,
and don’t act entitled.
Why weren’t you two
watchin’ Nuttall’s bike ride?
Fuck yourself.
I want to see his gun and his remains.
Where is Charlie buried?
My brother
is buried in a secret burial place
by his own private instructions!
Jesus Christ, Bullock!
- Put together a court or don’t!
- Quiet, you!
Don’t hush me in my
own fucking joint.
And if we take it outside, old man,
expect a different outcome
from the other fuckin’ day.
You best have 5 of your
fuckin’ cappers then with,
rifles at the ready.
I got 5 and 5 behind them,
indoors or out.
I too must report
to the Sheriff a death,
a Cornishman at theft has been shot
in Mr. Hearst’s claim.
Killed?
Yes, in flight.
It’s all fuckin’ amalgamation
and capital, ain’t it, Wolcott?
Mr. Utter, are you a student of Hume?
Smith?
A disciple of Karl Marx?
Come on, Charlie.
My employer, Mr. Hearst, has interests
and connections in Montana, Sheriff,
as are imputed to you
in this morning´s “Pioneer.”
You shut your fucking mouth!
- Get him out of here!
- Down, Charlie !
Sure got to you, didn’t he, Mose?
Now he’s got to get you to die!
Let me, uh…
get my arm through here
so I can secure my toast.
You’re gonna lift me
one time too fuckin’ many!
You don’t go back in there if I let you go.
-  I’m leavin’ the whole fuckin’ camp!
- Going where?
A letter come to hand
I need to take to Bill’s missus.
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Camp bidness.
He wrote
- just before he got killed.
- I see.
And you know who fuckin’ give it to me?
How crazy life got?
And money must buy these bastards
any-fuckin’g-thing they want!
That cocksucker inside,
Mr. Amalgamation and fuckin’ capital!
Hearst’s geologist
gave you the letter?
And God knows
who he fuckin’ bought it offa…
or how many hands it passed through.
It fucks me up thinking Bill’s missus
got to handle something
that cocksucker touched.
Was it over the letter
you beat him the other day?
No no. Excuse me.
No, I give my word not—
not to say what that was over.
I’d best go, lest
Mr. Amalgamation and capital takes
one through the fucking head.
What’s the import of that expression?
Do I look like I fuckin’ know?
Some big-shot eastern magazine
reporter interviewin’ Bill
said that was what’s
changing things around.
Jane.  I don’t know what’s
gonna come of fuckin’ Jane.
I’ll keep an eye on her.
You should lock her in that cell
and don’t let her fuckin’ drink!
And don’t fuck yourself up
over Mose Manuel.
He’ll get hisself fleeced
of what is rightfully his
and what he got by fuckin’ murder.
He’ll be judge on hisself and jury too.
Just like the fuckin’ most of us.
Coach from Denver.
Here’s yours.
Good luck, Charlie.
We’ve brought you and Mr. Star lunch.
Thank you.
- I’m up!
- You want the bath?
I may well get to that.
- Ample here, ain’t it?
- Yeah.
Uh, formerly a cooperage.
My friend Eddie that bought him out
said the man had been
a season ahead of himself.
Well, lovely as it’s fixed
as a brothel,
I expect you will reopen soon enough,
Restock and reopen.
You’d think so, wouldn’t ya?
Stay awhile, Jane.
Be my guest.
Or favor me and stay.
I get top fuckin’ dollar.
New saloon in the camp, Jane?
I know that’s some clever opening gambit
to culminate in breaking my balls.
Just sayin’ I checked the usual spots
‘cause I wanted to say goodbye
before I left camp,
so incase you go ahead and fucking die...
Goodbye, Charlie, goodbye.
Have a good fuckin’ trip.
Shut the fuck up.
‘Cause it so happens when you return,
if no trees or animals killed you,
that you were fucking
driving crazy with criticism
you will find I’ve moved
out of this shitbox
so I don’t have to fucking
embarrass you or fucking have you
hovering over me like the ugliest
fucking nurse in the fucking universe.
Into where?
Into where what?
Into where are you fuckin’ movin’
when you fuckin’ move out of here?
Into the fucking whorehouse
down the way,
which you fucking sent me
to see that woman at,
if needin’ to piss in
my ear didn’t crowd out
every other thought or recollection
in your head!
How did the two of you get along?
Did I just fucking say
I was movin’ in there?
Which being it’s a fuckin’ whorehouse
could indicate
some fuckin’ business arrangement
or some other fuckin’ thing.
Yeah, I’m gonna be Queen Hooker.
You’re a keen fuckin’ student
of the human scene, Charlie!
Well, good!
Good.
Where are you going anyway?
I’ve made a decision not to tell you.
If you made a decision not to tell me,
what did you just fuckin’ tell me for?
My decision is not to tell you
my specific destination…
’cause…
I don’t think I should.
And that’s that.
Well, have a safe journey
to your unannounced destination
and a safe fucking return.
And good luck to you with
your new livin’ arrangement.
And...
my best, please, to,
uh, Miss Stubbs.
And you not only a fucking pain
in the balls, Charlie,
but also the strangest
fucking person I ever met.
You’ll get no argument here.
Good!
Well, I sometimes put 9 to amuse myself.
Alright, take it up.
Vigilant to detail like his Pa.
I’d think Mrs. Garret as
the bank’s chief backer
might wish to be present
for its opening.
Well, as far as that, I got her proxy.
Yes, but wouldn’t she wish to be?
Perhaps she would.
I can ask.
Excuse me.
What the fuck’s going on?
You ask the wrong fella.
The water comes to a boil
between them two fuckin’ women,
I will fuckin’ guarantee you that much.
Have you proposed to Mrs. Garret
as you fuckin’ swore you would?
Leavin’ aside what
I did swear or didn’t,
let’s say I fuckin’ have.
And?
That’s where the matter stands.
She ain’t said yes or no.
How did the lady incline,
fuckin’ Ellsworth?
I wouldn’t guess, fuckin’ Trixie.
Did you present yourself
enthusiastic?
Well, I didn’t dance a jig
if that’s what you’re asking.
Or more fuckin’ glum-like,
next to invitin’ refusal.
Not glum, not…
invitin’ refusal.
Straightforward, I’d call it.
- Sincere?
- Yeah.
Well, what the fuck
is her fuckin’ problem then?
You’re a worthy enough fuckin’ candidate,
given all her fuckin’ givens.
Warm endorsement.
She’d have to state her reservations.
Mrs. Garret writ me a letter
saying how yesterday she lost her
temper with you somewhat,
and judgment,
she tipped she was on
to you bein’ a Pinkerton.
Oh, bein’ bright,
I expect you concluded
it was me must have told her,
meanin’ maybe
I had sold over to her,
and with my allegiance now in question,
I expect you wired
the Pinkerton big-shots,
arguing you oughtn’t sign any documents
that might be able to prove that you,
the agency
and Mrs. Garret’s fuckin’ in-laws hired me
to lay at Mrs. Garret’s doorstep
the murder of her husband.
And further, Mr. Swearengen,
that as to purchase of your allegiance
-now in question-
they might wish to
keep the bidding open.
Biddin’s open always on everyone,
Miss Isringhausen.
But I expect you understand,
knowin’ as I do,
should Mrs. Garret lose her claim,
rather than operate it themselves,
her cunt in-laws will sell
to third-party cocksuckers inimical
to the whole of my interests
in this camp.
To buy my allegiance
against myself,
in-law cunts
and shit-heel operators would
have to bid very high indeed.
No, more likely
Miss Isringhausen,
I think you’d contemplate changing
your allegiance before I would mine.
What benefit would I consider
might accrue to me?
I intercepted your shit-heel boss’s
message back to you,
through the miracle of telegraph,
and it answers that very question.
As I have it here before me,
I will read it to you verbatim.
“Miss Isringhausen, as this
will save you great pain...
"... and keep you from being killed,...
"...sign all documents
Mr. Swearengen has drawn.
"Take the $5,000 and disappear.
"Yours sincerely,
"your boss,...
...Pinkerton shit-heel.”
The $5,000 alluded to in
the invisible telegram,
can the money be produced?
Without, of course, exposing
him to the contents of the document,
I would want the sheriff
present at my signature,
and as my escort from the camp.
I bet that can be arranged.
I can’t betray the confidence of messages.
Don’t guarantee what
you’ll never do, Blazanov
not without imaginin’
your feet stuck to the fire.
Sir...
I am a person whose parents
have been murdered,
and no other family connection
and feeling,
and believe
in confidence of messages.
What the fuck’s all that supposed to mean?
I hope…
feet in the fire
would not change me.
Congratulations, Mr. Nuttall.
- Thank you, young man.
-  How’s the boneshaker?
Unshook.
Which would be a fib to say about me.
I’ve come, Sheriff,
to ask what you’ve learned
of the shootin’ yesterday in my place.
Mose Manuel said his brother
killed himself by accident.
Uh, by accident?
Two hours before Mose sells their claim
that Charlie said they’d worked theirselves
lock, stock and barrel to the Hearst interests?
There’s no witnesses, Tom.
Hurtful, brother against brother,
in a joint that bears my name...
the most recent hurtful event.
But might I ask William to assist me
in calibrating the boneshaker’s
handlebars?
Go ahead, William.
I don’t know how to
calibrate handlebars, sir.
Oh, knowledge is
overrated, William.
diligence is what’s required
in the service of a willing spirit.
Easy, easy, boy.
I use my right hand to pour.
And then Miz Bullock
said as it’s yours,
you might want to see
the safe installed.
Did she?
Yes, Ma’am.
Havin’ brought the midday meal
as the safe arrived
with the money inside.
And what did Mr. Bullock
say to Mrs. Bullock?
He said that might be
a good idea.
With enthusiasm equaling yours
as you describe the moment?
I’d say on Mr. Bullock’s part,
about equal enthusiasm,
Mrs. Garret, yes.
Despite which Mrs. Bullock persisted?
Well, perhaps I oughtn’t
to disappoint her.
Earlier when I asked what else
we might have to discuss,
I referred to my proposal.
I took that to be your
meaning at the time.
Chose not to respond.
Not to, yes, as I hadn’t
yet made up my mind.
- Have you now?
- Nor have I now.
Would you have me decide now,
before I act on
Mrs. Bullock’s invitation?
Do you put me to those terms
I guess there’s no burning rush.
Shall we go for a walk, Sofia?
Are you sure you won’t join us?
Thank you. I tend to forego
the midday meal.
It occurred to me,
Mrs. Garret having reason
to be present in any case,
that we might discuss
in more formed a fashion,
our plans for the children’s schooling,
more constructively than in
some previous conversation.
I’m delighted.
Wonderful.
Mr. Swearengen asked
to see you, Sheriff.
Not just now.
A man tying the right rope to the frame
and the other end to a thunderhead,
could use the machine to tow clouds.
I wish I was taller.
Well, when your legs lengthen,
I calculate you’ll be among
the great cloud haulers of the world.
Just to ride like you did yesterday, Mr. Nuttall.
You should have seen your face.
The Bella Union gap was my crucible, William.
the fabled mud slick.
I shifted shoulders forward,
not too much,
and at a sledge-trench, Ho!
Swung my buttocks left, by God,
turned the bars just so,
thump!
The buried plank,
bom !
And did I not come through a treat?
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Garret.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Bullock.
Very good wishes on a venture offering opportunity
to so many in the camp.
- Thank you.
- Hope.
For taking up the education
of the camp’s children,
my Sofia included, thank you.
As I feel I expressed inadequately
when last we spoke.
Bite of meat, Mrs. Garret?
No, Thank you.
That appears to be the safe.
William,
do we dare ride double?
-  I do if you do.
- I do!
Dauntless then!
Courage high to the sticking place,
and honor bright
as I mount and circle and consider
the best way to swoop you up.
Awaiting you here, Sir.
Great.
Beautiful.
This all seems very much in order.
First depositor.
it’s to witness some...
wrist business, Sheriff.
Al said brief but of crucial importance.
- How long will we be?
- Brief, very.
And you’d save me a beatin’.
Excuse me.
Get your head on it.
My head is on it.
Get your head on it, Tess!
It’s on it, Mr. Tolliver.
It does sound like a girl with
a mouthful, Mr. Manuel.
Her tongue in her cheek can
achieve the same fuckin’ effect.
I require a conversation
with the Sheriff.
Confess a crime.
You’re fuckin’ cheatin’ me!
Get the fuck out from under there!
I ain’t cheatin’ you, Sir.
Will you have another dealer,
Mr. Manuel?
Another fuckin’ cheat?
Hot and cold’s the way the cards
run, Sir, time immemorial.
I want it back.
Give it back to me!
Give him his last wager, Leon.
We’ll call that one no bet.
Yes, sir, Mr. Tolliver.
All of it. Everything.
Now, I can’t do that Mr. Manuel,
as I believe you know
- And those rifles are aimed at your head.
- Everything!
Including youth, Mr. Manuel?
And why not beauty?
Not credibly restored, perhaps,
but as a new
non-negotiable term?
Would you not have, too,
your brother Charlie resurrected?
Would you stipulate your envy
of him be purged surely,
you’ll insist that Charlie
retain certain defects,
his ineffable self-deceptions,
for example,
and purpose, so far as you had one.
I suppose you would see removed
those qualities
which caused you to love him,
and the obliviousness to danger
which allowed you to shed his blood.
I want to talk to Bullock!
Get the fucking Doc!
I coulda cooled that out.
On my order, Mr. Tolliver,
Lee will burn this building,
mutilating you before,
during or after as I specify,
or when he chooses
unless I forbid.
My full attention is at your disposal.
Tell Sheriff Bullock what transpired
here before getting the Doc.
And now how many?
Eight.
Two portions of four.
Very good, Sofia.
May I have candy?
You ask a reward, Sofia,
for doing your numbers??
Where would you get such an idea?
“Received...
...from Trixie…"
The whore.
May I sign the first receipt?
Yes, please do.
Huzzah.
I’m to fetch Sheriff Bullock.
He’ll be back momentarily.
All right, let’s go.
- Ready, ready, ready!
- Ready, here we go!
We missed.
Trial run.  No harm done at all.
Hey, swing around, Tom!
On my way!
Tie off that leg rope.
Don’t you want to serve your country
as good as they been to you?
I bet you don’t even vote.
Hold that leg rope!
That’s between us.
Tell no one I give you that.
I best now, but thank you.
You keep it a secret,
and you won’t get into any trouble.
And if you told I helped you on the bike,
that’s between you and your father.
Oh shit!
I think my back’s broke.
