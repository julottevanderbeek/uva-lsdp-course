ANNOUNCER:
We got the wrong man, Bob.
That's Adam Cartwright.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Who are you?
MAN:
A friend.
A friend?
You're sure
a feather-footed one.
Who are you?
Gerald Esketh, by name.
Here, perhaps this will relieve
your mind.
U.S. Deputy Marshall.
I can't say I'm sorry
to see you.
Who were they?
The Clevenger Brothers.
Friends of yours?
Hardly that, but you may have
made a terrible mistake.
Just be thankful
that you're still alive.
And I'll be thankful that I've
reached the end of a long trail.
The Clevengers were wanted in
California for bank robbery.
I had the, uh... unpleasant duty
of killing their older brother.
He was caught robbing
sluice boxes.
Oh, so you were the one.
I was only performing
my official duty.
Mr. Esketh, welcome
to the Ponderosa.
From what Adam tells me,
we're greatly in your debt.
Well, I'm happy that I was
fortunate enough
to be in the right place
at the right time.
Well, we'll try to make your
stay here
a very comfortable one.
- Please.
- Thank you.
I appreciate a great deal what
you did for Adam, Mr. Esketh.
For all of us.
Adam, anything else
you want to tell me?
Well, I still can't
believe it, Pa.
I mean, I'm not selling
the Clevengers short--
roughest bunch
of renegades I've ever known--
but I just can't imagine
them taking a shot at me.
You never know with that bunch.
Old Gid Clevenger and his boys
have made their own laws
for so long, you never know when
they might step over the line.
And you did have the ranch
payroll with you.
They must have thought
I was somebody else.
Believe me, Adam, I know
how you feel,
but the marshal did have
a warrant for them.
Well, there's one thing for
certain,
he isn't too upset about it.
Now, come on, we've got a guest
to take care of.
We'll decide later what
to tell Gid Clevenger.
If he gives us a chance to talk.
BEN :
Yeah.
The bucolic life
is not for Gerald Esketh.
Pa, I put Mr. Esketh's bag
in the upstairs room.
Thanks, son.
Well, one would scarcely expect
to encounter the épée
out here in the wilderness.
Well, Little Joe's mother
was Louisiana French.
He likes to play around
with them.
You mean, you actually use this?
Well, I fool around
with it just for fun.
He's faster than greased
lightning, Mr. Esketh.
Come on, Joe, let's show him.
En garde, brother.
You should never have given
those two a chance to show off.
Oh!
Dadgum...
You know, they really have no
intention of killing each other.
He has an admirable skill.
Whack him over the head, Hoss.
You'll never get anywhere
poking at him.
Touché.
Nevertheless, your technique
is not quite flawless.
When you feint to the left,
you're a bit off balance.
En garde.
En garde.
You know, you could hurt
somebody with that.
Lost the button off the point.
So I did.
This might have been fatal.
Violence as such is vulgar.
Any man, who in anger,
takes a human life,
becomes a brother of the apes.
He's an aesthetically
impoverished man.
Don't you think so?
Oh, yes, sir.
I reckon.
And yet, the skills and rhythms
of disciplined violence
have beauty,
like a painting by Rubens
or Botticelli.
Unfettered by personal emotion.
Yes.
There, to that simple word,
can be traced the downfall
of most artists
and many human creatures--
emotion.
Yeah, that's a... that's
a very interesting observation,
Mr. Esketh.
I don't think I could cast you
in the mold
of an average lawman.
I've been told that.
Well, I think the elegance and
hospitality of your home
have made me forget
my original mission.
I'm here to visit an old friend.
Would you happen to know
a Mr. Jason Blane?
- Oh, the assayer?
- Yes.
Oh yes, know him--
know him very well.
And his wife.
Wife?
Jason married?
Oh, yes, about a year.
They were married
right in this very room.
Then you do know him well.
Well, Jason has always been
a little hard to know,
but, uh, Mariette is practically
a part of our family.
Mariette. What a charming name.
Yes, uh, her father was
a very dear friend of mine.
When he died, he left
the raising of Mariette
almost entirely
to my supervision.
Jason Blane married.
How very, very interesting.
Is she a pretty girl?
Oh, we always thought so.
But of course, we could be
slightly prejudiced.
Oh, no, my dear Adam,
I have a feeling
I can trust your judgment
in such matters.
Time to eat, please.
Oh, good.
Could I, uh, freshen up
a bit before supper?
Why, of course.
I'll show you to your room.
Adam, what're you staring at?
Oh, I didn't realize I was.
Look, I know you feel bad
about the Clevengers.
But it's like
Esketh told Hoss and me.
Bob and Bill had a bead
right on your back.
He had to shoot fast and any way
he could.
You ought to just be thankful
he was there.
Yeah, I'll try to remember that.
Come on, let's have some supper.
Right.
And so, under the circumstances,
there was little I could do.
And that, gentlemen, is the way
I shot my first tiger in India.
Oh!
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
Number One Cousin,
can't you do anything right?
Here, let me do that.
Sorry, Gerald.
Mr. Cartwright, take you long
time to know San Francisco.
Take me long time
to know Ponderosa.
I help you in San Francisco,
you help me in Ponderosa.
All right?
All right, thank you.
You know, for years we had the
most wonderful cook, Hop Sing.
He went back to Hong Kong,
and talked me into hiring
his Number One Cousin.
I don't know.
Number One Cousin?
Doesn't he have a name?
If he's got one,
he hasn't told us about it.
I'm sorry about this, Gerald.
Think nothing of it.
The same thing happened
when I was dining
with the Prince of Wales
in Paris.
Dadgum, Mr. Esketh,
if you ain't been just
about every place.
And there's one place I never
cease to enjoy going to.
- Where's that?
- Bed.
I've had a long ride
and I'm afraid
I'm not much of a night owl.
Gerald, this has been
an extremely pleasant evening--
extremely pleasant.
I'm sorry about what happened
at the end of it.
Oh, Hoss and Joe, see that Mr.
Esketh has everything he needs.
Yes, sir.
And tomorrow morning, Adam and
I will ride into Virginia City
with you, we'll show you where
Jason and Mariette live.
Fine. Fine.
Have a good rest.
Adam, I regret the circumstances
under which we met,
but I'm grateful
that we-we did meet.
A stranger in
a strange community.
It's heartening to have
substantial friends.
- Good night.
- Good night.
HOSS:
Mr. Esketh, did you sure enough
have that old tiger cat
by the tail?
ESKETH:
Sure enough.
That Hoss makes the most
wonderful audience, doesn't he?
I hope you'll go along
with my little whimsy
in wanting to surprise Jason.
We were such close friends,
and it's been such a long time
since I've seen him.
Are you sure you can
find the house?
My dear Adam, your directions
are most explicit.
Now, don't forget,
we want you to spend
at least a few days with us
at the ranch house.
I know Adam and the boys
will want to take you
on that cougar hunt.
Ben, I can't tell you how much
I appreciate your hospitality.
And, as I told you before,
there's nothing in life I find
as exciting as a hunt.
Thank you, again, both of you.
Adam, when you get
through at the bank,
meet me at the hotel,
we'll have a bite to eat.
- Right.
- C'mon.
Pardon me, dear lady,
if I startled you.
But I had wrongly assumed
that no one was home
and had started to leave.
I'm glad that I was in error.
You're Mrs. Blane?
Yes, I am.
The Cartwrights told me
all about you.
Are you a friend
of the Cartwrights?
And an old and dear friend
of your good husband.
Gerald Esketh is my name.
Surely, Jason has mentioned me.
No, I don't recall.
Well, that is, I've never met
any of Jason's friends.
Did you meet him in California?
I did, indeed.
My dear child,
Jason's mineralogy
has surely been worthwhile.
He's found a true jewel.
I don't know if you're
making fun of me or not,
but Jason is not at home.
Then perhaps you wouldn't mind
if I waited a while for him.
Ben and Adam have some business
to transact in town,
and I'm a total stranger here.
Oh, yes, of course.
How rude of me.
Won't you come in, Mr. Esketh?
Thank you.
Oh, won't you sit down,
Mr. Esketh?
Thank you.
I'll make you some tea.
How very thoughtful of you.
What a fine likeness of Jason.
Yes, it is, isn't it?
- Hey.
- Jason, good morning.
- How are you, Adam?
- Fine. Did your friend find you?
Oh, who's that?
Your friend from California--
Gerald Esketh.
No.
Is there anything wrong?
Uh... no.
Uh, everything's all ri...
Esketh-- uh, is he here in town?
Well, he stopped over
at our ranch last night,
and he rode into town
this morning with us.
Went to your house.
He wanted to surprise you.
Thank-thank you, Adam.
You have some very
interesting things, Mariette.
I couldn't help
but notice this jewel box.
Oh, Jason took that
for assaying some ore.
: I'm afraid
he isn't very practical.
But he is sweet.
We've been so happy here.
I'm sure you have.
We thought most highly of Jason
in San Francisco.
Oh.
How elegant these
must look on you.
Oh, but they're not real pearls.
But your beauty would make them
appear priceless.
Please, may I see them on you?
Oh, Jason, darling,
there you are.
Look who's here.
My dear Jason,
after all of these years.
Esketh.
They're reviving the old case
in Sacramento, Jason,
and they couldn't
very well proceed
without the chief
prosecution witness-- you.
Is this something
you two gentlemen
would rather discuss privately?
No, no, not at all.
My business
as a law enforcement officer
is public business,
and I'm sure that you
and your husband have no secrets
from each other.
I'll fix you some tea, Jason.
Have you told her
of this matter?
No. How could I?
She's almost part
of the Cartwright family.
How much have you told her?
Nothing.
I detest emotional display.
What's the matter, Jason?
Nothing, Mariette.
Nothing you'd understand.
You're not aware
of all the facts, Mariette.
He has a right
to be a reluctant witness.
His testimony will be against
the most sinister forces
in Northern California.
They may seek retaliation.
Retaliation?
However, he'll be
in my protective custody.
Jason, I trust you
to be ready for the journey,
shall we say, at noon tomorrow?
Does that allow you enough time?
You trust me?
I amend that.
I trust your wife
to see that you're ready.
Thank you for the tea, Mariette.
It was indeed a pleasure
meeting you.
I should never have tried
to run away from it.
Jason, what do you mean?
I loved you so much.
I thought I had a right
to a little happiness.
But you did have,
and you still have.
I won't let you go back.
We can leave,
and we can make another start.
Don't you see
that that's what I tried to do
and this is the result of it?
Nothing will change.
I've got to go back with him.
But he said that it
would be dangerous.
I don't intend
to lose you, Jason.
I love you much too much.
- Pa?
- Oh.
Have you seen Esketh?
Oh, he's probably
still with Jason.
Did you get that matter
straightened out at the bank?
- Oh, yeah.
- Good.
But, uh... as I was leaving,
I ran into Jason,
and I told him that, uh, Esketh
was looking for him,
and he, uh...
he seemed very upset about it.
Oh?
Think Esketh is here as a friend
to see Jason,
or, uh, is he here
in an official capacity?
Well, I don't know.
Esketh is a United States
Deputy Marshal.
Of course, what do we
really know about Jason?
Came in here,
swept Mariette off her feet.
Of course, he's done very well
in the year he's been here.
He's been very good to her.
I suppose that's all
you could ask of any man.
Yeah, well, I'd feel better
if I had a talk
with Mariette and Jason,
just ask them if there
was anything wrong.
What do you think?
I think it's a good idea.
And also remind Mariette
that we're still her family
for as long as she needs us.
Look, while you're over there,
I'll go see Judge Rand.
Going someplace, my dear Jason?
I was young, Esketh.
It was over five years ago.
Time gets away
from a man, doesn't it?
I'm curious, Jason.
Why didn't you go back to Ohio?
My arm isn't quite that long.
You know I'm a mineralogist?
Yes.
I traced you
through Arizona, Idaho,
and all over the Comstock Lode.
You changed your name a couple
of times, but I found you.
Well, you can't take me out
of Nevada Territory.
Here are the extradition papers.
I trust, Jason, you are growing
tired of trying to run away.
Everything legal
and aboveboard, huh, Esketh?
Always.
Which reminds me--
I must present my credentials
to your local judge.
I had a little official business
on the way in.
Billy and Bob Clevenger.
You saw the Clevengers?
Briefly, through my sights.
They're both dead.
What about Gideon, the old man?
Always a good friend
to you, wasn't he, Jason?
No, I haven't seen him yet,
but I'll plan to see him
before he sees me.
You, um... seem to have built up
a nice little business here.
Oh, why don't you
get it over with?
Why don't you kill me
and have done with it?
No, Jason.
I'll kill you because that's
what I came here for.
But I'll pick my own time
and my own place.
And besides...
I intend to get much better
acquainted with your wife.
She's lovely, Jason--
completely lovely.
Hello, Mariette.
Oh, Adam,
I'm so glad to see you.
What's the matter?
Is there something wrong?
Oh, no, nothing.
It's just that... I haven't
seen you for so long.
Where's Jason?
Oh, he went to the office
to, uh,
pick up some things.
Mariette...
you're just about as close
to being a sister
as I'll ever have.
Now, a big part of that pleasure
is being able to help you.
Tell me--what happened
when Gerald Esketh came here?
Oh, nothing happened.
I think Mr. Esketh
is a very charming person.
We, uh... we even had tea.
Oh, Adam.
:
I just can't lie to you.
I've tried, but I just can't.
That's more like it.
Now, tell me about it.
Jason has to go to California
to be a witness in a trial.
Well, that doesn't sound
so terrible.
I know, but the men
that he has to testify against--
they threatened to kill him.
You see, that's why Jason
left California.
I see.
Did he talk to Judge Rand
about this?
Oh, that was
my first suggestion,
but Jason didn't think
it would do any good.
Well, Jason's upset.
I think I'm in a better position
to decide than he is.
So, why don't you and I
have a talk with Judge Rand?
I think we'll find that Jason
can make a legal deposition
right here in Virginia City.
Oh, Adam, could we do
something like that?
Well, we won't know
until we ask, will we?
Come on, get your hat.
All right.
I'm sure when we know
all the facts...
Adam.
My dear Mariette.
What a pleasant surprise
this is.
Forgive me, Your Honor.
I am United States Deputy
Marshal Gerald Esketh.
You're in my
federal district, Marshal.
If you have business here,
you should have presented
your documents to me.
I fully intended to do so, sir.
As a matter of fact,
I was on my way to your chambers
when your, uh, messenger
intercepted me.
Mrs. Blane states
that her husband's life
will be in danger if he...
if he gives certain testimony
in Sacramento.
To some extent,
she may be right.
I myself
will not feel too secure
as his pledged bodyguard.
Now, you will note there, sir,
that this is
and a number of John Does,
all of whom comprise
a political machine
known as the Murdoch Gang.
Now, these are
infamous men, sir,
grown fat on terrorism
and plunder.
So rich and powerful, indeed,
that they now have most of
the state of California under
their rule of dread and fear.
Blane is the key witness?
We on the side of the law
earnestly believe
that Jason Blane is the one man
who can send these culprits
to the gallows.
Well, your husband's duty
is clear, Mariette.
And we can't very well call out
the militia to guard him.
Well, I was planning a trip
to Sacramento in a week or so.
I could change my plans,
go along with you,
if it would make Mariette
feel better.
Oh, it would, Adam, it would.
Anything to relieve
this dear lady's anxieties.
And rest assured,
we'll be joined by
other officers in Sacramento.
Oh, I'm very grateful to you.
To all of you.
Uh, Mr. Esketh,
I'm terribly sorry
to have caused you
all this trouble.
It's no trouble, my dear.
On the contrary,
I was delighted to see revealed
that jewel which money
cannot buy: loyalty.
Marshal, you and Adam both--
I-I'd like to talk to you.
If it's, uh, if it's all right
with you, Mariette.
Of course not.
Adam, Jason will be
so pleased to know
that you're going with him.
Thank you, gentlemen, thank you.
It's about the killing
of the Clevenger brothers.
Ah, yes, a distasteful duty,
I assure you.
But there is a warrant out
in California for their arrest.
I was talking
to your father, Adam.
He was telling me that Gideon
Clevenger came to see him.
Yeah, but he didn't seem
to want to make any trouble.
Strange man--Gideon Clevenger.
He'll brood about
the death of his sons,
then he'll decide to take
the law into his own hands.
He can be very dangerous,
if he makes up his mind to it.
Well, the thought
of any further bloodshed
is completely repelling to me.
I'll rest a whole lot easier
when you're out of town,
on your way back to Sacramento.
Then you think that this, um,
Gideon Clevenger
will make the death
of his two sons
a personal issue
between himself and me?
I think that precisely.
I see.
Jason.
Jason, I have
the most wonderful news.
I've just come from
talking to Judge Rand.
You what?
Oh, it's all right, darling.
He's going to write a letter to
a friend in Sacramento, a judge.
And then Adam is
going to go with you.
No, no, he can't do that.
But, Jason,
Adam only wants to help.
Well, he,
well, he can't go with me.
But why?
Tell me why.
Because if Adam Cartwright
goes with me,
he'll never get there alive.
Jason, what are you
trying to tell me?
Can't we make one move
in our life
without the Cartwrights
getting mixed up in it?
But the Cartwrights
are my best friends,
and they're the best friends
you ever had.
I don't want to talk about it.
Jason, now, come on,
this isn't like us.
I'm your wife, and I have
a right to know the truth.
Well, I have told you the truth.
Tell me something.
Why did you say that
if Adam went with you,
he would be killed?
Because that is the truth, too.
Jason, I have never asked you
anything about
your past life before, because
it just wasn't important,
but now it is.
Now, do they want you as
a witness for something you saw
or for something you did?
What difference does it make?
Esketh told you about
the Murdoch gang, didn't he?
Yes.
Well, that gang
isn't going to let me
get to Sacramento alive.
Not even with Mr. Esketh
and Adam to protect you?
Don't you realize that Esketh
was sent here to kill me?
Once I leave here, I'll be dead
before I can get
as far as the Ponderosa.
But why would anybody
want to kill you?
Because that's why he came here.
He is a hired, paid killer.
Now, try to understand that.
Jason, there must be
something we can do.
There must be!
What?
You want me to get a gun?
Go up against him?
He would love that.
Self-defense,
everything above board, legal.
Then why don't you
go to Judge Rand?
Tell him the truth,
and he'll protect you.
You saw his papers;
he is a marshal.
He has every right in the world
to take me in.
And you're gonna stand there
and let him do it.
Well, what else can I do?
We can go away.
We can go East.
Jason, please, please.
They can't reach that far.
Even if we have to spend
the rest of our lives hiding,
I don't care.
I'd much rather have you that
way than not have you at all.
Please.
Oh, if we only could.
If we only could.
It would be like
starting from the beginning.
No West, no past tense.
Oh, Jason.
Jason, we must do it.
We must. We can.
I know we can.
You get some things packed.
There's still Esketh.
Don't forget,
I tried this once before.
Oh, but don't forget,
you didn't have me before.
Now, I can handle him.
I think I know a ladies' man
when I see one.
Yes, I know
how to deal with him.
No, I can't let you do that.
He's too dangerous.
Oh, no, darling, really,
he won't be with me.
Please, trust me.
Trust me.
Now, hurry; hurry and get
something packed, please.
Adam, I find this a land
of unexpected pleasures.
Little did I dream that you'd be
making the trip
to Sacramento with me.
Well, since I am,
don't you think it, uh, might be
a good idea to let me in
on the truth?
Well, isn't that
a rather strange way
to put a question, Adam?
Well, as Pa and I both told you,
we think a great deal
of Mariette.
And so do I think a lot of her.
That's why I tried to spare her
the seriousness of Jason's case.
Then he's not just
a missing witness.
No.
A missing criminal.
But on your honor, Adam,
this is to go no further
in Virginia City.
By turning state's evidence,
he'll be able to return here
with no damage
to his so-called reputation.
Well, I appreciate whatever
protection you can give
Mariette.
You know,
I believe we think alike.
I even had him listed
in the documents as a witness,
not as one of the accused.
Thank you for telling me.
Pa'd like to get
the best lawyer he can find.
Adam, I don't want you
to think it rude of me,
but under the circumstances,
I think it best
not to return to the Ponderosa.
I'll take a room here
at the hotel,
and if it's convenient for you,
we'll leave, shall we say,
first thing in the morning?
Fine with me.
I'll bring your luggage
in with me.
And bring along
your best suit, Adam.
I know some pretty girls
in Sacramento,
and perhaps we can forget some
of the more unpleasant aspects
of a marshal's duties.
Very good.
If I, um, seemed a little cool
toward you,
it's--was only because of
my concern for Mariette.
Well, I, uh, better let Pa know
what's happened.
- Right.
- See you in the morning.
MAN:
The Clevengers!
Clevengers!
The Clevengers!
Gid Clevenger.
I'd hoped this wouldn't happen.
Maybe we can reason with him.
No, Ben.
Let me try it.
Hello, Gideon.
We haven't seen you
for some time.
Save your words, Judge.
I know Gerald Esketh's
in this town.
Now, where is he?
I really don't know, Gideon.
Look at me when I talk to you.
I don't like fellers
who can't look straight.
You've lost three sons
trying to fight a private war.
Why don't you just find yourself
a rocking chair
and live to a ripe old age, huh?
I've got a better idea
that'll help a lot more people.
You deliver Esketh to me,
I'll get out of Virginia City
and stay out.
You don't, I got 20 more men
anxious to ride in here.
You're not serious.
I've offered you a fair deal.
Get me that back shooter.
Come in.
Oh, my dear Adam.
They tell me Gideon Clevenger's
looking for me.
He's threatened
to tear the whole town apart
unless you're handed over
to him.
He seems a truly
dedicated scoundrel,
faithful to his purpose,
honest to a fault.
I want you to know that
Pa and I will be backing you up.
Thank you kindly, Adam.
Shall we, uh,
look into the matter?
Well, you're certainly a cool
one, I'll have to admit that.
What are you going to do?
Make our friend
a sporting proposition.
He's in the saloon?
Clevenger!
Can you hear me?
I can hear you, Esketh.
It's a voice
I'm not likely to forget.
You made this personal,
Clevenger,
so let's keep it that way.
There's no sense in
harming innocent people.
You've made yourself a deal.
But if the Cartwrights or anyone
else tries to get into it,
I'm cutting my boys loose.
You're free
to change your mind anytime.
Thank you, friend,
but I find the arrangement
most satisfactory.
I've already
planned my strategy.
I don't like this, Adam.
I'm beginning to think
Esketh knows what he's doing.
Make your play, you filthy
little back shooter.
You first, my dear Clevenger.
You'd better finish
the job, Esketh.
Adam, you'd better
get the doctor
and see what
we can do for Clevenger.
How is Clevenger?
He'll pull through.
He wants to see you.
I took the liberty of dropping
in without knocking.
Well, I was sure
the door was locked.
You grow lovelier
each time I see you.
I must look a sight.
A sight, indeed.
The very kind that inspired
Wordsworth to rhapsodize,
"She was a phantom of delight
when first she gleaned
upon my sight."
Now, you know
that you much prefer
those sophisticated
San Francisco women
to a country girl like myself.
I hope someday to prove
the error of that statement
by putting you beside them--
a ruby in a diadem of glass.
Oh, you mean the ones
from the Barbary Coast?
What lies has Jason
been telling you about me?
Why none, none.
It's just that I know so little
about San Francisco.
It was only a chance remark.
Please accept my apology.
I'm thin-skinned when it
comes to matters of honor.
Oh, I apologize, too.
I had planned to look
much more presentable
the next time we met.
Then it was rude of me
to arrive so unexpectedly,
but I thought I better
tell you
that Judge Rand suggested
that I start back
to Sacramento immediately.
Oh, so soon.
You don't know how
lonely it gets.
I mean, Jason has
to work such long hours.
I've never met anyone
like you, Gerald.
A little more time
won't matter.
Could you come to the hotel to
let me know when Jason is ready?
Just as long as you
aren't too impatient.
Now, let us not misunderstand
my honorable intentions.
I understand
your intentions perfectly.
- You little fool.
-
You're going to learn just who
you've been playing games with.
Who?
What are you?
He's Murdoch's hatchet man.
Around the Embarcadero, they
call him the Dude Butcher Boy.
It's my reckoning he came here
to lead Jason Blane
to the slaughter,
'cause Jason knows too much.
Jason was mixed up with Murdoch?
He was the spotter
for the bunch.
That's easy for an assayer.
Whenever he'd see gold bullion,
he'd tell Esketh.
That slimy killer would lead
his night riders,
claiming they were vigilantes.
That was a good cover for him.
But Jason got sick,
and he quit and ran away.
Jason was too soft
for Esketh's shooting parties.
I saw him later
in Virginia City,
but I figured
let a feller go straight
that's trying hard.
And your oldest son?
Esketh back-shot my boy at
our California stamp mill,
while his outfit looted.
The other two--
you know about, Ben.
They wasn't killers.
They heard Esketh was
headed this way.
They mistook Adam for him.
That fool, Jason.
Why couldn't he tell us
the trouble he was in?
There's a thing called
reputation, Ben,
especially if you're married
to a woman like Mariette.
I'd swear she never knew
that Jason had a record.
- Mariette...
- No, don't!
It's all right, honey,
it's me, it's Adam.
Oh, Adam.
Where's Jason? Was Esketh here?
Yes.
He hit me and he slapped me,
and he wanted me to tell...
Did he tell you
who he really is?
Yes, and he said terrible
things about Jason.
Where is Jason? Where is he?
Where is he?
The... Silver Corazon Mine.
I'm supposed to meet him there.
He gave me
a little trail... map.
He took it. It's gone.
He took it. He took the map.
- Honey, shh, shh. Calm...
- He'll kill Jason.
- He'll...
- Calm down!
Now listen, I'll send somebody
to look after you.
Now, don't go away.
You stay right here, okay?
Jason?
Jason!
You can't get away, Jason.
Can you hear me?
Would you like to hear what
happened to your wife?
She died in my arms, Jason.
I held her.
I watched her.
Can you take that
and run away with it?
In here, Esketh!
Come on!
Come on!
-
-
The unruly emotions, Jason.
But don't be ashamed because
they've destroyed you.
They've conquered more men
than Napoleon's armies.
Go ahead. Go ahead and shoot.
The sound will bring
them right to you.
I'm here!
We're in here!
We're in here!
Don't turn around.
Jason.
Mariette?
She's all right.
I'm taking you in, Esketh.
It's hot in here, isn't it?
Or is it just the uncomfortable
circumstances I find myself in?
-
- No.
It might have worked
on Clevenger,
but it won't work on me.
My dear Adam, you don't think
that I'd be childish,
so childish as to pull
the same chestnut twice?
I wish you hadn't
tried it, Esketh.
I suppose I...
I knew all along that this would
happen... someday.
Thank you for your...
hospitality, Ben.
I never dreamed
that Gerald Esketh w...
would be defeated by emotions.
I can't believe you
ever had any.
Oh, yes, I did.
I was in love, you know.
I was in love
with Gerald Esketh.
We'll miss you very much.
Thank you, Ben,
thank you for everything.
Judge Rand said it shouldn't be
more than a year.
And that will be the longest
year of my life.
Well, I'm glad you made the
decision on your own, Jason.
When you come back, your house
will be here, waiting.
Thank you, Ben.
Good-bye.
We'll be waiting, too.
Things will be just the same.
Thank you, Adam.
