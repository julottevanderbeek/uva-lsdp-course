WE ARE GATHERED
HERE TODAY
TO CONSIGN THE MORTAL REMAINS
OF MILLARD FRYMORE,
OR WHATEVER HIS NAME WAS.
I AIN'T GOT A LOT TO SAY
ABOUT MILLARD.
HE RODE AMONGST US
TWO DAYS AGO,
AND WAS STRUCK DOWN
BY WHATEVER DISEASE IT WAS.
WE CAN ONLY HOPE WHATEVER
DEADLY DISEASE IT WAS,
IT WASN'T PARTICULARLY
CONTAGIOUS.
WITH THAT IN MIND
I SUGGEST WE BOW
OUR HEADS IN PRAYER.
HEAVENLY FATHER,
WE CONSIGN
TO YOUR TENDER MERCY,
ALL THAT REMAINS--
GET OUT!
ALL THAT REMAINS
OF ONE MILLARD FRYMORE,
ORIGIN UNKNOWN,
CAUSE OF DEATH UNKNOWN,
AND OF CONCERN
TO THOSE OF US
WHO HAVE HAD CONTACT
WITH HIM
DURING
THE LAST TWO DAYS.
MILLARD WAS STRUCK DOWN
IN WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY
THE PRIME OF HIS LIFE.
HE WAS TOOK FROM US
SO FAST,
HE NEVER GOT TO UNPACK
HIS SUITCASE.
HOWEVER, INASMUCH
AS WE WERE
THE LAST TO KNOW MILLARD
ON EARTH
AND INSOFAR AS WE WERE
DRAWN TO THIS COUNTRY
IN SEARCH
OF A COMMON GOAL,
I'M CERTAIN YOU'LL AGREE--
PA!
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU?
LOOK!
HAVE YOU
NO REVERENCE?
IT'S GOLD!
WHAT?
LOOK, IT'S GOLD.
I'D LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE
WE'RE HERE TO CONSIGN
THE REMAINS OF MILLARD FRYMORE.
IT'S GOLD!
GOLD!
DOWN THERE,
IN THE GRAVE.
WHOA!
MOVE THIS COFFIN
AWAY!
AND HAVE A LOOK.
NO, YOU DON'T!
GET OUT
OF MY GOLD MINE!
GET OUT
OF MY GOLD MINE!
GET OUT
OF MY GOLD MINE!
GOLD!
GOLD!
GOLD!
IT DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE
THAT A TOWN COULD GET
IN THIS CONDITION SO FAST--
LYNCHINGS, GUNFIGHTS,
AND THAT DRUNKEN REVELRY
GOING ON
AT MADAME ORR'S HOUSE.
24 HOURS A DAY.
A DECENT WOMAN ISN'T SAFE
IN THESE STREETS.
I THINK THE WOMEN
ARE SAFE ENOUGH
FOR THE MOST PART.
WE ONLY GOT A COUPLE
THAT'D BE OF INTEREST
TO ANYONE...
OUTSIDE THE
DANCE HALL GIRLS
WHO ARE GOOD
AT HANDLING THEMSELVES
IN A PINCH.
OR IN A TICKLISH
SITUATION.
NOW, THIS MAY BE FUNNY
TO THE TOWN COUNCIL,
BUT WE MINE OWNERS
HAVEN'T FOUND
ANYTHING
TO LAUGH ABOUT.
WE DON'T THINK
IT'S FUNNY.
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.
WE NEED A NEW
MAYOR AND
TOWN COUNCIL
THAT KNOWS WHAT
TO DO ABOUT IT.
WHAT KIND OF
TALK IS THAT?
WE ALL KNOW
THE REASON I'M MAYOR
AND THEY'RE COUNCILMEN
IS BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE
WANTED THE JOBS.
DON'T FORGET, WE'RE
MINE OWNERS OURSELVES.
DO YOU ENJOY GIVING 20¶
OF EVERYTHING FROM THE MINES
TO THE DANBYS?
WHY
WOULD WE?
LET'S DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.
WHAT? YOU KNOW
THE SITUATION.
THERE'S US,
HERE IN CALENDAR.
THERE'S GALENA,
WHERE WE SHIP OUR GOLD.
THERE'S
THE DANBY RANCH,
HALFWAY BETWEEN.
THE ROAD EVEN RUNS
THROUGH THEIR PROPERTY.
FINE. WE'LL BUILD
THE ROAD
AROUND THEM.
HOW?
THEY OWN
THAT WHOLE VALLEY!
BESIDES,
WITHOUT 20¶
THEY'LL ROB
EVERY STAGE
THAT COMES
THROUGH.
WE'VE GOT TO
DO SOMETHING,
EVEN BRING
TROOPS IN.
TROOPS?
TROOPS?
WHAT TROOPS?
THE NEAREST TROOPS
ARE 500 MILES.
THEN WE'LL
RECRUIT
OUR OWN.
WE CAN'T
EVEN RECRUIT
DISHWASHERS.
HOW WILL WE
RECRUIT TROOPS?
NOBODY WANTS TO
STOP PROSPECTING
TO TAKE A BATH,
LET ALONE JOIN AN ARMY.
IT HAPPENED SO FAST
WE JUST AIN'T
HAD A CHANCE
TO GET
ORGANIZED YET.
THE DANBYS
ARE TAKING
ADVANTAGE.
THERE GOES
ONE OF THEM NOW.
WHICH ONE
IS HE?
JOE.
OUT OF THE FATHER AND BROTHERS
HE'S THE SECOND TOUGHEST
THEY ALL ACT
LIKE THEY OWN
THE PLACE.
THE WAY THINGS
ARE NOW, THEY DO.
IT WILL STAY
THAT WAY
TILL WE FIND
A SHERIFF
THAT ISN'T
AFRAID.
WHISKEY.
ALL RIGHT,
YOU ALL SAW IT,
AND IT WAS
A FAIR FIGHT.
HE DREW FIRST.
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.
HE DREW FIRST.
SURE AS ANYTHING.
IT WASN'T ANYTHING
BUT SELF-DEFENSE.
IT WAS SOMETHING,
BUT NOT SELF-DEFENSE.
HE DIDN'T DRAW FIRST.
YOU DID.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IT'S AN OLD TRICK.
YOU DID IT
PRETTY WELL.
NOT REAL WELL,
BUT PRETTY WELL.
YOU FEINTED WITH
YOUR LEFT SHOULDER,
GETTING HIM TO GO
FOR HIS GUN.
WHILE YOU WERE GOING
FOR YOURS AT THE SAME TIME.
IT'S AN ARIZONA
TRICK,
BUT I'VE SEEN IT
UP NORTH.
YOU CALLING ME
A LIAR?
YOU HEARD EVERY
WORD I SAID,
AND I DIDN'T
CALL YOU A LIAR.
I SAID, YOU FEINTED WITH
YOUR LEFT SHOULDER
WHILE GOING FOR YOUR GUN
WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND.
SO?
YOU BEAT HIM
TO THE DRAW.
HE'S DEAD
AND YOU'RE ALIVE.
THAT'S THE IDEA OF
THE GAME, ISN'T IT?
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
JASON McCULLOUGH.
WHAT'S YOURS?
JOE DANBY,
AND YOU BETTER REMEMBER IT.
I'LL REMEMBER IT.
THAT'S ALL I'LL DO
THE REST OF MY LIFE,
IS GO ROUND
REMEMBERING YOUR NAME.
THE BREAD
IS ON THE TABLE.
THANKS.
OH!
WHY, YOU!
THIS ONE OF "EMMA'S TASTY
HOME COOKED MEALS"?
THAT'S IT,
MISTER.
THEY CHARGE $3.00
FOR THIS, HUH?
IT'S CALLED
INFLATION.
SOMETIMES IT
CATCHES YOU
RIGHT IN BETWEEN
MOUTHFULS.
IS THERE REALLY GOLD
IN THIS TOWN?
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE
TO GET THAT?
ALL YESTERDAY
AFTERNOON,
GOOD PART
OF THIS MORNING.
WHERE COULD A MAN FIND
A PLACE TO SLEEP?
IF YOU MEAN A ROOM,
YOU CAN'T.
DOWN THE STREET,
GET A COT.
HOW MUCH?
$20.
EIGHT-HOUR SHIFT.
SAY A MAN
WANTED
TO GO
TO WORK
TO GET
A STAKE.
HOW WOULD
HE DO IT?
YOU DON'T
WANT A JOB?
NO. WITH THE PRICES
AROUND HERE,
I'LL GO BROKE
ABOUT 2:30 TODAY.
CHECK DOWN
AT THE ASSAY OFFICE.
HMM?
OH, THANK YOU.
WAIT!
OK,
GO AHEAD ON.
FIGHT!
GO AROUND!
OUT OF MY WAY!
GET OUT
OF THERE!
I'LL KILL YOU!
I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING--
WATCH WHERE
YOU'RE GRABBING!
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT ABOUT ME?
WANT TO
GRAB SOMETHING?
EVERYTHING LOOKS
TOO SLIPPERY.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
OH, NOTHING.
YOU LOOK TOO CLEAN
TO SUIT ME.
YOU THE MAN
I TALK TO--
WAIT YOUR TURN.
ABOUT THE JOB
OF SHERIFF?
YOU INTERESTED IN
THE SHERIFF'S JOB?
WELL, MAYBE.
WHAT DOES
IT PAY?
NO SHERIFF
LIVED LONG ENOUGH
TO FIND OUT.
WHY DON'T YOU
GO WATCH THE FIGHT?
THE LADIES, TOO.
GOOD FIGHT
OUT THERE.
YOU WATCH IT TOO, SAM.
COME ON!
LET'S GET OUT.
GET MOVING.
LET'S GO.
I'M OLLY PERKINS,
THE MAYOR.
JASON McCULLOUGH.
FRED JOHNSON,
HENRY JACKSON, TOM DEVERY--
THREE ORIGINAL SETTLERS.
FRED AND HENRY ARE
FROM THE TOWN COUNCIL
I REPRESENT
THE MINE OWNERS.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
WHAT THAT FELLOW
SAID AIN'T TRUE.
WE'VE HAD
THREE SHERIFFS.
BUT ONLY TWO OF
THEM GOT KILLED.
WHAT ABOUT
THE OTHER ONE?
HE QUIT KIND
OF SUDDEN-LIKE.
HE DIDN'T HAVE THE
RIGHT TEMPERAMENT.
WHAT ABOUT
THE PAY?
FOR THE RIGHT
MAN, $150 A MONTH.
WITH THE SPIRALING
PRICES AROUND HERE,
THAT WILL LAST
ABOUT EIGHT DAYS.
THAT INCLUDES
ROOM AND BOARD.
NOT AT EMMA'S
FOOD EMPORIUM?
AT MY HOUSE.
MY DAUGHTER COOKS.
I THINK IT'S ONLY
FAIR TO TELL YOU,
I'M ONLY
INTERESTED IN THIS JOB
ON A TEMPORARY BASIS.
OH?
I WAS ON MY WAY
TO AUSTRALIA
WHEN I HEARD ABOUT
YOUR GOLD STRIKE.
AND I DECIDED TO
TRAVEL THROUGH HERE.
WHAT'S IN
AUSTRALIA?
IT'S THE LAST
FRONTIER COUNTRY.
I MIGHT DO
SOME PIONEERING.
I THOUGHT THIS
WAS FRONTIER COUNTRY
AND WE WAS PIONEERS.
ME, TOO.
IF I TAKE
THE SHERIFF'S JOB,
IT'D HAVE TO BE WITH
THE UNDERSTANDING
THAT I GET
ENOUGH TIME OFF
TO DO PROSPECTING
I CAME HERE TO DO IN
THE FIRST PLACE.
WELL, YEAH.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR
JOB QUALIFICATIONS?
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT.
IF I TAKE IT,
YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU GOT ME.
IT'S A
QUESTION
OF YOU BEING
ABLE TO HANDLE IT.
OLLY, WE
CAN'T BE CHOOSEY.
HIM
TALKING ABOUT IT
SHOWS THE
RIGHT ATTITUDE.
I DON'T CARE!
I'M THE MAYOR!
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY
TO HIRE A SHERIFF
THAT'S NOT ONLY GOT
QUALIFICATIONS,
BUT THAT AIN'T GOING
TO GET HISSELF KILLED.
OLLY, HAVEN'T
WE ALREADY--
THERE YOU ARE.
WHAT'S
YOUR POINT?
AN EXHIBITION
OF MARKSMANSHIP.
THE BULLET WENT
THROUGH THE HOLE.
WELL,
MAYBE IT DID.
IT DID. YOU CAN
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.
I'D LIKE TO
TAKE YOUR WORD--
WOULD YOU
DO IT AGAIN?
AGAIN?
IF YOU
DON'T MIND.
I SHOT
YOUR ROOF.
THAT'S
ALL RIGHT.
I HOPE YOU
DIDN'T TAKE
NO OFFENSE
AT WHAT
I SAID BEFORE.
NO.
JUST TO KEEP
THE RECORD STRAIGHT,
$150 A MONTH IS FINE,
BUT I'VE GOT
TO DO PROSPECTING.
I'M GOING
TO AUSTRALIA--
YOU JUST
NAME YOUR TERMS.
WE'LL RUSH
TO MEET THEM.
AS LONG AS
EVERYTHING'S STRAIGHT.
IS THERE
SOME KIND OF BADGE?
YOU BET
THERE IS!
I'M AFRAID
IT'S BENT UP.
IT MUST HAVE SAVED
SOMEONE'S LIFE.
IT WOULD HAVE
IF IT WEREN'T
FOR THEM
OTHER BULLETS.
GENTLEMEN,
DO WE HAVE
A JAIL HERE?
DO WE HAVE
A JAIL?
A BRAND-NEW ONE
THAT THE WHOLE
COMMUNITY BUILT
LAST MONTH.
JUST LIKE A
BARN RAISING.
EVEN THE
DANCE HALL
GIRLS HELPED.
CARRIED ON
LIKE CRAZY.
IT WAS DESIGNED
TO BE ESCAPE-PROOF.
I THINK I NEED TO
THROW A COUPLE
OF PEOPLE IN IT.
THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING.
THIS JAIL HAS
EVERYTHING.
EVEN
A STOVE.
ONLY IT HASN'T
GOT IRON BARS.
YOU'RE KIDDING.
WE SENT AWAY FOR THEM,
BUT THEY AIN'T ARROVE YET.
IT'S GOT
EVERYTHING ELSE--
WINDOWS, BROOMS,
KEROSENE LAMPS...
YOU NAME IT.
JUST NO BARS
FOR THE CELLS.
RIGHT.
I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.
ARE YOU WANTED
FOR ANYTHING?
NOT THAT
IT MATTERS
BECAUSE
WE UNDERSTAND
HOW THEM LITTLE
THINGS CAN HAPPEN.
NO, I'M NOT WANTED
FOR ANYTHING ANYWHERE.
DO YOU REALIZE
THE CHANCE YOU
WAS TAKING?
HE MIGHT HAVE
TOOK OFFENSE.
I'M THE MAYOR!
I GOT
RESPONSIBILITIES!
IT HAD
TO BE ASKED!
IF I
COULD GET
SOME MEN
ON THIS PUMP,
WE COULD
STOP THIS.
SURE THING,
SHERIFF.
GIVE US A HAND,
WILL YOU, MEN?
ALL RIGHT, MEN!
LET HER GO!
A LITTLE MORE.
BREAK IT UP!
OK, CUT IT!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STOPPING
A FIGHT.
WHO ARE YOU?
I'M THE
NEW SHERIFF.
WE GOT
A NEW SHERIFF!
LET'S SEE
IF HE SCARES
AS EASY AS
THE LAST SHERIFF.
I WANT ALL YOU PEOPLE
TO QUIT
DISTURBING THE PEACE.
CLEAN UP THIS MESS.
YES, SIR.
ANYTHING ELSE?
YOUR NAME?
JAKE.
JAKE, GO INTO
THE MINT SALOON.
THERE'S A FELLOW
IN THERE NAMED JOE DANBY.
YOU TELL HIM
I REMEMBER HIS NAME,
HE'S UNDER
ARREST FOR MURDER.
YOU TALKING
TO ME?
YOU DEAF?
YOU WANT ME
TO TELL HIM
HE'S UNDER ARREST?
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO AFTER
HE KILLS ME?
I'LL ARREST HIM
FOR BOTH MURDERS.
WHERE'S THE JAIL?
FOLLOW ME, SHERIFF.
YOU WON'T FIND
A BETTER JAIL
FOR 200 MILES.
IF YOU
CAN FIND ONE.
EVERYTHING
SEEMS IN ORDER.
OUR LAST SHERIFF
WAS A GOOD ORGANIZER.
YELLOW, BUT
A GOOD ORGANIZER.
WE'LL BE
GETTING THE BARS
ANY DAY NOW.
THAT OUGHT
TO DO IT.
THAT OUGHT
TO DO WHAT?
TAKE
CARE OF IT
TILL THE
BARS ARRIVE.
MY THINGS ARE
AT THE STABLE.
I'D LIKE TO GO
PICK THEM UP.
I HAVE A ROOM
FOR YOU AT MY HOUSE.
SHALL WE GET
ON OVER THERE, AND
I'LL PICK UP THAT DANBY FELLOW.
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU BETTER KNOW
ABOUT THE DANBYS.
WHY BOTHER
THE SHERIFF
ABOUT THAT?
HE WANTS TO GET SETTLED.
WE CAN FILL HIM IN
AFTER HE'S SETTLED.
YOU COMING, MAYOR?
I'LL BE
RIGHT THERE.
THIS IS A
LITTLE LIKE MURDER.
I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT.
IT DON'T MEAN
WE'LL LOSE
ANOTHER SHERIFF.
OUR LUCK IS
BOUND TO CHANGE.
WHAT ABOUT
HIS LUCK?
PRUDY?
PRUDY?
JUST PUT YOUR
THINGS OVER THERE.
ALL RIGHTY.
PRUDY!
I WANT YOU TO
MEET MY DAUGHTER.
SHE'S A GOOD COOK
AND A FINE LOOKING GIRL.
TAKES AFTER HER
DEAR DEPARTED MOTHER.
HER MOTHER DIED?
NO, SHE
JUST DEPARTED.
I'LL SHOW
YOU THE PARLOR.
THAT ORGAN
COME ALL THE WAY
FROM DUSSELDORF.
MOST OF THE FURNITURE
WAS SHIPPED
THROUGH ST. LOUIS
AND CHICAGO.
THIS IS MY DESK
WHERE I DO MY MAYOR WORK.
VERY NICE.
I GUESS YOU
COULD SAY THIS IS
THE FINEST HOUSE IN TOWN.
WELL, LET ME SHOW
YOU THE DINING ROOM.
PRUDY!
I WANT YOU
TO MEET SOMEONE!
THIS IS THE
DINING ROOM.
YOU SURE HAVE
A NICE PLACE.
THANK YOU.
HOW ABOUT A DRINK?
WATER, IF
YOU HAVE SOME.
WATER?
SURE. WE'VE GOT A PUMP
INSIDE THE KITCHEN.
RIGHT INSIDE
THE HOUSE?
THERE'S
THE PUMP, RIGHT THERE.
BEFORE YOU
GO TO ARREST
JOE DANBY,
COUPLE OF THINGS
YOU SHOULD KNOW.
ALL RIGHT.
THERE ARE FOUR DANBYS.
FATHER AND 3 SONS.
THEY'RE
ALL PRETTY
TOUGH CUSTOMERS.
OUTLAWS?
NOT EXACTLY.
BUT IN MANY
WAYS, THEY'RE
LIKE OUTLAWS.
HOW?
THEY DO
AS THEY LIKE.
THEY GET
NASTY WHEN
ANYBODY INTERFERES.
YOU MEAN YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO ARREST THIS BOY?
NO. IT'S JUST THAT
IT'S A NEW IDEA.
IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF
GETTING USED TO.
I STOOD RIGHT THERE
IN THAT SALOON
AND WATCHED HIM GUN
A MAN DOWN IN COLD BLOOD.
I BELIEVE YOU, SHERIFF.
YOU EXPECT IT FROM JOE.
IT WASN'T SELF-DEFENSE?
NO.
SOMETIMES THEM THINGS
HAPPEN SO FAST.
IT DIDN'T
HAPPEN ALL
THAT FAST.
LOOK, MR. PERKINS,
YOU'RE THE MAYOR.
IF YOU ORDER ME
NOT TO ARREST HIM,
YOU'RE
THE BOSS.
I'LL RETURN
THIS BADGE
BECAUSE THAT'S
NO WAY TO RUN THINGS.
I AGREE.
I COULDN'T AGREE
WITH YOU MORE.
I'LL EXPECT ALL
THE LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS
TO BACK ME UP.
THEY WILL, SHERIFF--
MAYBE NOT ALL
OF THEM AT FIRST.
LIKE I TOLD YOU,
I'M HEADED
FOR AUSTRALIA.
DO WHAT YOU
THINK IS BEST.
I'LL ALERT
EVERYBODY THAT--
WE'RE ALL
BEHIND YOU.
DON'T GIVE IT
ANOTHER THOUGHT.
YOU DON'T
NEED HELP
WITH
JOE DANBY?
NO. I CAN
HANDLE IT.
OH, GOOD.
YOU'RE THE STRANGEST
GIRL I EVER MET.
GO AWAY.
DO YOU ALWAYS SHOW THIS
PECULIAR SIDE OF YOUR NATURE,
OR AM I JUST LUCKY
MY FIRST DAY IN TOWN?
I SUPPOSE
YOU HAVE REASONS
FOR SITTING UP THERE.
ORDINARILY, A GIRL
DOESN'T GET UNDRESSED,
POUR WATER
OVER HER HEAD,
AND THEN CLIMB TREES.
I'M WARNING YOU!
HI, MRS. DANVERS.
WHAT IN
THE WORLD--
PRUDY, IS THIS
MAN BOTHERING YOU?
DO YOU KNOW
HER, MA'AM?
OF COURSE.
THAT'S
PRUDY PERKINS.
SHE LIVES
IN THIS HOUSE.
DOES SHE HAVE
ANY PAST HISTORY
OF STRANGE
BEHAVIOR LIKE THIS?
WHY, NO!
PRUDY
HAS ALWAYS BEEN
A SWEET, NORMAL, LOVABLE...
OF COURSE,
LAST YEAR...
WHAT HAPPENED
LAST YEAR?
WELL, WASN'T
REALLY ANYTHING,
BUT AT THE
ANNUAL TOWN PICNIC,
SHE GOT
HER HAIR CAUGHT
IN THE ICE
CREAM FREEZER.
HA HA HA!
WE OUGHT
TO BE MERCIFUL
AND
FORGET ABOUT
THIS WHOLE
UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT.
SEE YOU, MA'AM.
HA HA HA!
SHERIFF, I DIDN'T
TELL JOE.
WHY NOT?
NOBODY'S PAYING
ME TO TAKE
CHANCES LIKE THAT.
YOU NEVER KNOW
HOW JOE WILL REACT.
WHY WORRY
ABOUT JOE?
BECAUSE HE'S MEAN
AND NASTY.
HE ENJOYS
KILLING PEOPLE.
ALL THEM DANBYS ENJOY
THINGS LIKE THAT.
YOU'RE FASTER
THAN JOE.
WHO SAYS SO?
I'VE SEEN
YOU BOTH DRAW.
YOU'RE FASTER.
WHY SHOULD
THE MATTER
EVER COME UP?
JAKE.
HOW WOULD
YOU LIKE TO
BE MY DEPUTY?
I'D HATE IT.
EVEN IF
I LIVED,
I'D HATE IT.
I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH
THEY'RE PAYING YOU,
BUT IT
AIN'T ENOUGH.
HE'S
EXPECTING YOU.
SOMEONE TOLD HIM
YOU WAS COMING.
I HEAR YOU'RE
GOING TO ARREST ME.
YOU DON'T LOOK
NEAR AS TOUGH
AS SOME OF THEM
OTHER SHERIFFS,
PARTICULARLY THAT
OLD BOY WHO LASTED
ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF.
AFTER HE
TOOK THE JOB.
JOE, YOU JUST
MAKE ME FEEL
TIRED ALL OVER,
WHEN YOU
TALK LIKE THAT.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
TO HAVE TO KILL A MAN
WITHOUT
HAVING TO LISTEN
TO HIS STUPID
TALK FIRST.
REMEMBER, I'VE
SEEN YOU DRAW.
ALL RIGHT,
SHERIFF, HOLD IT.
DROP YOUR GUN BELT.
I COULDN'T LET
HIM SHOOT YOU
IN THE BACK.
OH, YOU
COULD HAVE.
IS THIS THE
KIND OF TOWN
YOU PEOPLE WANT?
IS THIS THE
KIND OF LIFE
YOU WANT TO LEAD?
THREE KILLINGS
IN ONE SALOON ALONE.
THE SUN HASN'T
EVEN SET YET!
ANY MORE FOOLISHNESS,
I'LL CLOSE THIS PLACE.
YES, SIR.
I WOULDN'T
BLAME YOU.
PICK IT UP, JOE.
GO ON,
PICK IT UP.
I'LL GET YOU
FOR THIS, JAKE.
YOU ARE ONE
TOUGH-TALKING
BLOWHARD.
YOU MIGHT
AS WELL COME ON.
LIKE IT
OR NOT.
WE'RE ON THE
SAME SIDE NOW.
COME ON.
EASY, BOYS.
ME AND
THE SHERIFF
TAKES A DIM VIEW
OF SHOWOFFS
WITH GUNS.
REMEMBER, THE SHERIFF
SAID NO MORE SHOOTING
TILL THE
SUN GOES DOWN.
IS THAT
WHAT HE SAID?
CLOSE ENOUGH.
DRINKS ARE
ON THE HOUSE!
JAKE, LOOK
AROUND THE DESK THERE
FOR A DEPUTY
SHERIFF'S BADGE.
I NEVER SAID
I WAS TAKING NO
JOB AS A DEPUTY.
YOU'RE TRYING
TO CORNER ME.
I'M SURPRISED AT
WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO ME, TOO.
I WAS JUST RIDING
THROUGH ON MY WAY
TO AUSTRALIA.
WHERE ARE
YOU GOING?
THIS IS
PLAIN STUPID.
YOU CALLING
THE SHERIFF STUPID?
DO I HAVE TO
LISTEN TO HIM?
HE'S JUST THE
TOWN CHARACTER.
WAS THE
TOWN CHARACTER.
I'M NOW A
DEPUTY SHERIFF,
AND PROBABLY THE SECOND
FASTEST GUN HERE.
DID YOU
HEAR THAT?
WELL,
HE PROBABLY IS.
IF HE ISN'T,
HE WILL BE
AFTER I'VE
WORKED WITH HIM
FOR A
COUPLE OF DAYS.
COME ON, JOE.
JOE, THE RIGHT
CELL IS YOURS.
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY BARS YET.
YOU'RE KIDDING.
THAT'S
WHAT I SAID.
WE'RE GOING
TO OPERATE AS IF
THERE WERE BARS.
YOU STAY ON
THAT SIDE OF THE LINE.
AND EVERYTHING
WILL BE FINE.
WHAT?
IN THIS JAIL,
YOU STAY ON
THAT SIDE OF THE LINE
AND WE WILL
JUST GET ALONG FINE.
YOU EXPECT ME
TO SIT IN THIS
LOUSY CELL--
WHAT'S THAT
RED STUFF ON
THE FLOOR THERE?
THAT'S THE
POOR FELLOW
THAT CROSSED
THE LINE EARLIER TODAY.
JOE, JUST STAY THERE
AND BEHAVE YOURSELF.
WANT SOMETHING TO READ?
READ?
NO, I GUESS
YOU WOULDN'T. SORRY.
WELL, I SEE YOU
FOUND A BADGE.
YEAH.
ARE WE CLEANING
UP THIS TOWN?
YEAH,
THAT'S ABOUT IT.
ALL BY
OURSELVES?
WE WOULDN'T
REFUSE HELP.
NOBODY'S GOING
TO OFFER HELP.
YOU'RE PROBABLY
RIGHT, JAKE.
HOW MUCH
MONEY AM I MAKING?
WELL,
LET'S SEE.
THEY'RE PAYING
ME $150 A MONTH.
SAY YOUR SALARY
IS HALF THAT,
PLUS ROOM AND BOARD,
PLUS AMMUNITION
YOU NEED
FOR THE JOB.
OF COURSE,
I HAVEN'T CHECKED
WITH THE MAYOR
AND TOWN COUNCIL--
THEY MIGHT
TURN ME DOWN?
NO,
I DON'T THINK SO.
THEIR ATTITUDE
WILL LIKELY BE,
"IF HE'S WILLING
TO TAKE THE JOB,
"DON'T ROCK THE BOAT."
YOU CAN BET
THAT'S WHAT THEIR
ATTITUDE WILL BE.
EVER BEEN SHERIFF OF
A TOWN THAT NEEDED CLEANING UP?
NO.
EVER BEEN A SHERIFF
OF ANY KIND OF TOWN?
NO,
NOT THAT EITHER.
BUT THE MAYOR
THOUGHT I WAS QUALIFIED.
HE'D THINK THAT
IF YOU WAS BLIND AND
CRIPPLED IN BOTH LEGS.
YOU'VE GOT
THE SITUATION PEGGED.
WANT ME TO
WARM SOME COFFEE?
I NEVER TURN DOWN
A CUP OF COFFEE.
HOW LONG YOU
BEEN OUT WEST?
FOUR YEARS.
FROM WHERE?
EAST.
I'M FROM INDIANA.
THAT COULD
BE GOOD OR BAD.
YOUR FOUR YEARS OUT WEST,
WHAT YOU BEEN DOING?
MOSTLY MAKING
MY WAY TO AUSTRALIA.
FOR FOUR YEARS?
SOME TAKE LONGER
THAN OTHERS.
WHAT'S IN AUSTRALIA?
LOTS OF THINGS.
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.
ANY OTHER
QUESTIONS, JAKE?
AW, I...
NO, THAT'S
ALL RIGHT.
I WANT
A DEPUTY
WHO'S AT EASE
IN HIS MIND.
WELL,
YOU AIN'T GOT ONE.
YOU WON'T GET
ONE AROUND HERE.
WHY AUSTRALIA?
YOU'D KNOW IF YOU
EVER READ A BOOK ON IT.
I NEVER SEEN ONE.
THEY GOT ONE IN
THE CHICAGO LIBRARY.
IF EVER YOU'RE
THERE YOU OUGHT
TO TAKE A LOOK.
THEY
GOT PICTURES.
THEY GOT LITTLE PEOPLE
ABOUT LIKE THAT.
THEY GOT
A STICK
THAT WHEN THEY
THROW IT AWAY,
IT COMES
RIGHT BACK.
THEY GOT ONE
ANIMAL THAT HOPS
AND'LL BOX YOU
AND CARRIES THINGS
IN ITS TUMMY.
WHEN YOU SHOT
JOE'S FRIEND
IN THE BACK,
YOU FIRED
TWO SHOTS.
I FIGURED THEY
WENT IN ABOUT
THAT FAR APART.
PRETTY SLOPPY
SHOOTING, JAKE.
WELL, I WAS
IN A HURRY
TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.
I WASN'T TRYING
TO GROUP MY SHOTS.
IF HE'D BEEN FIVE
FEET FURTHER AWAY,
YOU'D HAVE
MISSED HIM ENTIRELY.
I'D SAY THAT
WAS PRETTY
PITIFUL KILLING, JAKE.
SEE THAT
BOTTOM NAIL?
YEAH.
IT'S WEIRD THAT
ANYBODY COULD
SHOOT LIKE THAT.
IT'S JUST
PRACTICE.
HOW COME
YOU'RE UNKNOWN?
A SHOOTER LIKE YOU
WHO DRAWS AS FAST AS YOU
SHOULD HAVE
A REPUTATION.
A REPUTATION
JUST GETS YOU KILLED.
YOU GO ON
PRACTICING.
I'LL PUT JOE
BACK IN JAIL.
JOE.
I TOOK THE
BULLETS OUT.
YOU JUST
WON'T COOPERATE.
I KEEP LAYING
DOWN THE RULES.
YOU DON'T PAY
ANY ATTENTION.
WAIT TILL
MY PA AND BROTHERS
FIND OUT I'M HERE.
I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO MEETIN'
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY.
COME ON.
I WAS HUMILIATED
IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS.
I DOUBT IF
YOU HAVE THAT
MANY FRIENDS.
THEN I HAVE
TO SIT IN JAIL.
PA WILL SKIN
ME ALIVE FOR
GETTING CAUGHT.
HE DOESN'T MIND
YOUR MURDERING,
JUST DON'T
GET CAUGHT?
I DIDN'T MURDER
ANYBODY, THAT
WAS SELF-DEFENSE.
WE'LL LET
THE JUDGE
DECIDE THAT.
WE DO
HAVE A JUDGE?
NEVER NEEDED
ONE TILL YOU COME.
SPOILED ALL YOUR FUN?
YOU CAN SAY
THAT AGAIN.
OH, THAT'S FUNNY.
THAT'S
REAL FUNNY.
GOT ANY
RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS
AGAINST DRINKING, SHERIFF?
NOT SINCE GIVING
UP MY PARISH.
I'M ONLY
KIDDING, MAYOR.
OH. HA HA!
WHAT ABOUT
MY DEPUTY?
OK, BUT
WHY DID YOU
PICK JAKE?
JACK BACKED
ME UP WHEN
IT COUNTED.
ANOTHER
MAN MIGHT NOT.
THEN IT MIGHT
BE TOO LATE.
HOW ABOUT
A JUDGE?
THE NEED
AIN'T EXACTLY
BEEN FELT BEFORE.
JOE SAID THAT.
BUT, IF I CAN'T
APPOINT ONE, WHO CAN?
MUST HAVE BEEN
SOME SHOW AT THE SALOON.
SOBERED UP THE TOWN.
THAT'S GOOD.
MAYBE,
MAYBE NOT.
IT WAS FUN
HERE UP TILL NOW.
EVERYTHING
WAS WIDE OPEN.
NOBODY LOOKED
DOWN ON ANYBODY
WHO SHOT SOMEBODY ELSE.
NOBODY POKING
THEIR NOSES INTO
NOBODY ELSE'S BUSINESS
WITHOUT GETTING
THEIR NOSES BLASTED OFF.
NOW THAT WE GOT
LAW AND ORDER,
CHURCHES
WILL MOVE IN.
THAT'S USUALLY
THE NEXT THING
THAT HAPPENS.
THEN THE WOMEN
WILL FORM COMMITTEES
AND HAVIN' BAZAARS.
THEY'LL CHASE MADAME
ORR'S GIRLS OUT
OR MAKE THEM
GET MARRIED OR WORSE.
BUT LIKE YOU SAID,
THE LAW IS THE LAW
AND WE ALL HAVE
TO FACE UP TO IT.
WHEN DID I SAY THAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
I WAS BROKE WHEN YOU
OFFERED ME THIS JOB.
YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO TAKE IT.
THERE'S DOZENS
OF OTHER JOBS.
WELL, DON'T WORRY.
I'M NOT GONNA
KEEP IT TOO LONG.
REMEMBER,
I'M JUST PASSING THROUGH
ON MY WAY
TO AUSTRALIA.
I'LL DRINK TO THAT.
¶ LA LA LA LA LA ¶
¶ LA LA LA ¶
¶ LA LA LA LA ¶
AH!
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?
YOU WAS
ON FIRE, PRUDY!
FIRE?
I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF THESE STUPID THINGS
THAT HAPPEN
TO ME!
SOMEBODY BETTER
DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT SOON.
THAT'S QUITE
A DAUGHTER
YOU GOT THERE,
MR. MAYOR.
I THINK
SHE'S CRAZY.
WHY WOULD
YOU THINK THAT?
I KNOW
WHAT I'D THINK.
SHE'S HAD
SOME TERRIBLE
SHOCKS THIS YEAR.
SHE GOT WEALTHY
ALMOST OVERNIGHT.
MAYBE IT
UNHINGED HER
A LITTLE.
THEN SHE
WAS ALWAYS
BIG FOR HER AGE.
PUBERTY
HIT HER HARD.
THAT'LL DO IT.
I DIDN'T KNOW--
IT WILL!
AS A DISINTERESTED STRANGER,
HOW DOES SHE HIT YOU?
WELL...
YOU ARE
DISINTERESTED, AIN'T YOU?
YOU COULD
SAFELY SAY THAT.
SHE'S A RICH
LITTLE OLD GAL
IN HER OWN NAME.
SHE OWNS
THE MILLARD FRYMORE
MEMORIAL MINING COMPANY.
WHOEVER MARRIES HER
GETS THE MINE?
SHAFT AND ALL.
THAT WON'T HURT HER
IN CERTAIN CIRCLES, WILL IT?
I'D BETTER FRY UP
SOMETHING TO EAT.
NO, THANK YOU,
MAYOR.
I BETTER GO
RELIEVE JAKE.
THIS IS HIS FIRST
NIGHT ON DUTY.
YOU'RE
EXPECTING TROUBLE?
WHAT DO
YOU THINK?
THE DANBYS.
YOU COULD
HAVE WAITED
BEFORE STIRRING UP
THAT HORNET'S NEST.
WHEN CLEANING
UP A MESS,
YOU DON'T JUST
LET IT GET BIGGER.
I GUESS
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.
WHAT GIVES YOU
THAT IDEA, MAYOR?
PUBERTY.
YOU AIN'T
HANDLING THIS
ALL BY
YOURSELF,
ARE YOU, PA?
DOES IT TAKE
MORE THAN ONE DANBY?
YOU ARE
A TIGER.
YOU'LL
CHARGE IN
THERE AND--
AND WHAT?
I DIDN'T
MEAN NOTHING.
YOU AIN'T GOT
BRAINS ENOUGH
TO MEAN NOTHING.
GO ORDER
A DRINK.
I'LL BE BACK
WITH JOE BEFORE
YOU CAN FINISH IT.
YOU GOT ONE OF
MY CHILDREN HERE.
HOW DARE YOU
WALK INTO MY OFFICE
AND PULL
A GUN ON ME.
GET YOUR FINGER
OUT OF THERE.
HOW DARE YOU!
TAKE YOUR FINGER
OUT OF MY GUN.
YOU BETTER TAKE
YOUR FINGER
OFF THAT TRIGGER.
AND LET THE HAMMER
DOWN REAL SLOW.
IF THAT
GUN WENT OFF,
IT WOULD
HAVE BLOWED
UP IN MY FACE.
IT WOULDN'T
HAVE HELPED
MY FINGER.
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
MR. DANBY?
MY SON, JOE.
IT SEEMS JOE MURDERED
A MAN THIS AFTERNOON.
I HEARD
IT WAS FAIR GUNFIGHT.
I WAS
RIGHT THERE.
WHERE?
IN THE SALOON
WHEN JOE KILLED HIM.
THAT WAS REAL
SMART OF HIM.
I'VE BEEN AROUND
JOE ALL AFTERNOON,
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
DO ONE SMART THING YET.
ANYTHING ELSE?
CAN I SEE HIM?
WHY DIDN'T
YOU TAKE THAT
APPROACH FIRST?
HE'S RIGHT IN THERE.
I'M OBLIGED TO YOU.
HI, PA.
WHAT IS THIS?
NO BARS IN THE WINDOW,
NO BARS IN THE CELL.
NO BARS
NOWHERE.
WHAT'S KEEPING
YOU IN HERE?
THAT GUY
OUT THERE.
HE WON'T LET ME
MOVE TWO INCHES.
HE LIES
ABOUT WHETHER
MY GUN'S LOADED.
WHAT?
ARE YOU
GETTING ME OUT?
NEVER MIND THAT.
WHO DID YOU KILL?
I DON'T
KNOW HIS NAME.
HE WAS SOME BUM.
BESIDES, HE DREW FIRST.
ARE YOU GONNA BELIEVE ME
OR THAT LIAR OUT THERE?
WHY DON'T
YOU SHUT UP?
IT WASN'T
ANYBODY THAT WE KNOW.
YOU SAID NO JAIL
COULD HOLD A DANBY.
WELL, NOW
THEY BUILT ONE.
AW.
YEAH, YOU'LL
HAVE TO STAY HERE
FOR A COUPLE
OF DAYS.
BUT WE RUN
THIS TOWN.
I AGREE WITH
THAT SHERIFF.
YOU DON'T DAZZLE
NOBODY WITH
YOUR INTELLIGENCE.
YOU SIT
TIGHT HERE
TILL I'VE
THOUGHT
THIS THING OUT.
COULDN'T YOU
HAVE DONE IT
WHEN THE SHERIFF
WEREN'T LOOKING?
HE WASN'T
THE SHERIFF THEN.
HEY, I DIDN'T
THINK OF THAT BEFORE.
THAT COULD
BE A LOOPHOLE
TO HELP ME GET OUT.
DON'T YOU TRY TO DO
NOTHING ABOUT THIS SITUATION.
LEAVE THAT TO
ME AND THE BOYS.
THAT'S A
LOUSY JAIL.
WE'RE JUST
GETTING STARTED.
WHAT'S HE
SUPPOSED TO BE?
MY DEPUTY.
LAST WEEK
HE WAS SHOVELING--
HE WAS WORKING
IN THE STABLE.
HE'S BEEN
PROMOTED.
WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO THIS TOWN?
WHAT DID DANBY WANT?
HE JUST CAME IN
AND WE TALKED.
THEN HE WENT IN
TO SEE JOE.
HE CAME BACK OUT,
WE TALKED MORE,
AND THEN HE LEFT.
HE STRIKES ME AS
BEING A LONELY MAN.
LONELY? DANBY?
HE'S A MEAN, NO-GOOD,
LOW-DOWN BUSHWHACKER.
YOU SEE?
NO WONDER HE'S LONELY.
HE STUCK
HIS FINGER WHERE?
SHUT UP.
EVERYBODY WILL LOOK.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
YOU HAD YOUR GUN ON HIM?
I AIN'T EXPLAINING
IT AGAIN.
I DON'T HAVE TO
EXPLAIN NOTHING.
INSTEAD OF ASKING
STUPID QUESTIONS,
WHY DON'T YOU
COME UP
WITH SOME HELPFUL
SUGGESTIONS?
WHY DON'T THE THREE OF US
GO THERE TOGETHER?
SO WHAT IF HE IS
THE FASTEST GUN?
WHO SAYS
HE'S THE FASTEST?
EVERYBODY.
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
IT ALL OVER TOWN.
WHAT COULD HE DO
AGAINST THREE OF US?
KILL TWO OF US.
YOU AIN'T TALKING
LIKE YOURSELF, PA.
YEAH.
YOU WERE ALWAYS
CHARGIN' IN
WITH US TRYING
TO HOLD YOU BACK.
WE AIN'T
LETTING JOE HANG?
OF COURSE WE AIN'T.
WHO SAYS WE GOTTA
TAKE CARE OF
THIS SHERIFF?
WHO SAYS ANYBODY
HAS TO DO IT?
WHY DON'T WE
RUN HIM OFF
LIKE WE DID
THE LAST SHERIFF?
BECAUSE THIS ONE
WON'T GO.
HE DIDN'T THROW A SCARE
INTO YOU, DID HE, PA?
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT
THE WAY IT SOUNDED.
I MEANT,
WHAT DID HE DO?
HE MADE ME
A LITTLE MORE THOUGHTFUL.
WE'RE MAKING
A LITTLE MONEY
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN OUR LIVES.
AND THE CHANCE
TO GET A LOT MORE.
IT'S A DUMB TIME
TO FIND OUT
WHO'S FASTEST
WITH A GUN.
US OR SOME SHOW-OFF
THAT MIGHT BE LUCKY,
EVEN IF HE
WASN'T GOOD.
WHO'LL HANDLE HIM?
SOME TRAMP
THAT'S GOOD WITH A GUN
CAN ALWAYS BE HIRED.
YOU ALWAYS SAID
DANBYS FIGHT
THEIR OWN BATTLES.
MAYBE I MEANT
ANOTHER BRANCH OF THE FAMILY.
I'M TAKING
A LITTLE TRIP TOMORROW.
YOU TWO BEHAVE
YOURSELVES.
DON'T MAKE THIS
SHERIFF A MARTYR.
WHAT'S A MARTYR?
I'M SORRY. THEY DIDN'T USE
THAT WORD IN THIRD GRADE?
I DIDN'T GET THAT FAR.
AW!
YOU REMEMBER WHEN
I WAS STUCK
IN THE SECOND GRADE?
OH, SHUT UP!
SHERIFF?
CAN I TALK TO YOU?
SURE, MISS PRUDY.
COULD WE
SIT DOWN?
SURE.
WELL...
HOW CAN I
BE OF SERVICE?
WHAT?
HOW CAN I
BE OF SERVICE?
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN SERVICE?
I DON'T
MEAN ANYTHING.
WHAT DO YOU
THINK I MEAN?
I'M JUST
A DUMB GIRL
FROM A HICK TOWN.
WHAT?
YOU SAID
YOU'RE A
DUMB GIRL--
I KNOW
WHAT I SAID.
ALL I WANTED
WAS TO EXPLAIN
SOME OF THOSE
SILLY THINGS
YOU SAW ME
DOING TODAY.
WHAT
SILLY THINGS,
MISS PRUDY?
HOW ABOUT
WHEN I BURNED
MY DRESS OFF?
WELL, THAT COULD
HAPPEN TO ANYONE.
HOW ABOUT
IN THE MUD
WHEN I WAS
DEFENDING MYSELF
FROM THAT PERVERT?
THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT ANY OVER
STIMULATED GIRL
MIGHT GET
HERSELF INTO.
HOW ABOUT
IN THE TREE,
HALF NAKED?
THAT ONE COULD TAKE
A LITTLE EXPLANATION.
IT WAS JUST
ONE OF THOSE DAYS
WHEN EVERYTHING
SEEMS TO GO WRONG.
EVERY ONE OF THOSE
RIDICULOUS THINGS
THAT YOU
SAW HAPPEN
HAS A PERFECTLY
SIMPLE EXPLANATION.
NOT THAT
IT MATTERS
I JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS DUMB
HAVING SUCH AN AT--
ATTRACTIVE MAN
THINKING I WAS
A HOPELESS LOONY.
WELL,
LOONY MAYBE,
BUT HOPELESS--
YOU...YOU THINK
I'M ATTRACTIVE?
WELL...
I DON'T THINK
A GIRL WOULD JUST
CURL UP AND DIE
BECAUSE YOU
SMILED AT HER,
BUT YES, I THINK
YOU'RE ATTRACTIVE.
WELL,
MISS PRUDY.
I SEE YOU'RE
A YOUNG LADY
WHO BELIEVES IN
LAYING HER CARDS
ON THE TABLE.
WHAT?
LAYING HER CARDS
ON THE TABLE.
WHEN A GIRL
DOES THAT,
I THINK A MAN
SHOULD LAY
HIS CARDS ON
THE TABLE, TOO.
YOU'RE A VERY PRETTY
AND ATTRACTIVE GIRL.
ANY MAN WOULD
BE ONLY TOO GLAD
TO TAKE YOU
OUT FOR A WALK
IN THE EVENING.
I'D FEEL
PRIVILEGED TO
DO JUST THAT.
HOWEVER, IF
YOU'RE THINKING
MORE SERIOUSLY,
I'LL HAVE
TO WARN YOU
I'M HEADED
FOR AUSTRALIA.
I'M JUST
PASSING THROUGH.
WHY, YOU CONCEITED--
CONCEITED?
I'M HEADED FOR AUSTRALIA.
WHO CARES
WHERE YOU'RE GOING?
ANY GIRL THINKING ABOUT
ENTERING INTO
ANY PERMANENT RELATIONSHIP--
I'M NOT THINKING
OF ENTERING ONE OF THOSE.
WHAT'S
WRONG WITH YOU?
DO YOU THINK
SOMETHING IS WRONG?
THERE ISN'T TIME
TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH!
GOOD NIGHT!
YOU ALL RIGHT,
MISS PRUDY?
SHUT UP AND MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS!
DAMN,
DAMN, DAMN!
PRUDY?
YOU SHUT UP, TOO!
DO YOU
SEE ANYTHING?
NO. WHAT ARE
WE LOOKING FOR?
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR NUGGETS, VEINS,
THE MOTHER LODE.
WHAT'S THE
MOTHER LODE?
I GET
THE FEELING
YOU DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT GOLD MINING.
OF COURSE I DON'T.
WHY DO
YOU THINK
I BROUGHT YOU?
I THOUGHT
EVERYONE AROUND HERE
KNEW ABOUT MINING.
BUT I DON'T.
I CAN
GIVE YOU
TIPS ABOUT
SHOVELING HORSE--
WORKING AROUND
THE STABLE.
I DON'T KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT
HUNTING GOLD.
CAN I PUT
THIS STUFF DOWN?
NO, YOU
BETTER NOT.
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I DO KNOW
ABOUT PROSPECTING
IT'S YOU'VE GOT
TO KEEP ON THE MOVE.
IT'S HEAVY.
LET ME
REDISTRIBUTE
THE WEIGHT FOR YOU.
I FEEL
LIKE A JACKASS.
THAT OUGHT
TO DO IT.
COME ON, JACK.
JAKE.
YOU'RE A PRETTY
GOOD FISHERMAN.
THIS IS
MORE LIKE IT.
LIKE WHAT?
WHERE I WANT
TO GO GOLD MINING.
YOU THINK
THERE'S GOLD
AROUND HERE?
YOU THINK
THERE ISN'T?
JOE DANBY
WILL BE MILES AWAY
WHEN WE
GET BACK.
HE'S HANDCUFFED
TO A POTBELLIED STOVE.
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
HAVE A LITTLE LUNCH,
TAKE A REST, THEN
YOU START DIGGING.
HEY, JAKE,
HOW SHOULD WE SPLIT
WHATEVER WE FIND?
60-40?
60 FOR WHO AND 40 FOR WHO?
THERE, YOU SEE?
SEE WHAT GOLD DOES?
WE'RE ALREADY
ARGUING ABOUT IT.
60 FOR WHO AND 40 FOR WHO?
THERE'S GREED
IN YOUR FACE.
YOU MEAN 60 FOR YOU, 40 FOR ME.
THANK YOU, JAKE.
THAT'S VERY
GENEROUS OF YOU.
HEY, JAKE.
WHAT DID YOU DO
BEFORE YOU
BECAME MY DEPUTY?
I DID
ODD JOBS.
LIKE WHAT?
A WHORE HOLDER
AT MADAME HORSES--
A HORSE HOLDER
AT MADAME ORR'S HOUSE.
A WHAT?
HORSE HOLDER.
WHEN THE HITCH RACK GOT FULL,
I'D HOLD THE EXTRA HORSES.
YOU SPEND
A LOT OF TIME WITH HORSES.
ONE END OR THE OTHER.
MY DADDY STOLE HORSES.
THEY HUNG HIM.
THAT'S A TERRIBLE THING
TO FIND OUT ABOUT A DEPUTY!
IF YOU HADN'T
SHOVED THIS JOB
DOWN MY THROAT,
YOU MIGHT
HAVE FOUND OUT
LOTS OF THINGS.
WANT MY BADGE BACK?
DON'T BE SILLY.
YOU BETTER
CLEAN UP THOSE FISH.
I'LL TAKE
A LITTLE NAP.
SURE IT WON'T
DISTURB YOU?
NO.
JUST DON'T RATTLE
THE POTS AND PANS.
YOU BOYS RIDE
INTO TOWN MORE QUIETLY.
YOU DROVE
YOUR POINT HOME.
GOOD.
GOOD.
THAT BRIGHTENS UP
THE WHOLE PLACE.
I DON'T FEEL
SO STUPID
SETTING IN HERE.
TELL JAKE I WENT
TO SEE THE MAYOR.
HAVE YOU
SEEN MY DADDY?
NOT SINCE THE NIGHT
WE HAD THAT LITTLE CHAT.
I'M SURE HE'S
PLANNING A JAIL BREAK.
YOU THINK SO?
WHAT ELSE WOULD
THEY BE DOING?
WHERE WILL I
FIND THE SHERIFF?
I IMAGINE
HE'S IN THE JAIL--
NO, WAIT
A MINUTE.
THERE HE IS NOW
COMIN' OUT OF THE
HARDWARE STORE.
MUCH OBLIGED.
SHERIFF.
ANYBODY KNOW
WHO HE WAS?
HE JUST
RODE IN.
HE ASKED ME
WHERE YOU WAS.
THANKS FOR
POINTING ME OUT.
HOLD IT
A MINUTE.
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO
IN THERE RIGHT NOW, HONEY.
WAIT HERE
JUST A MINUTE,
THEN I'LL
JOIN YOU.
HONEY, I THINK
I JUST BEEN...
DID YOU EVER
SEE HIM BEFORE?
NO.
UH, JAKE.
AFTER LUNCH...
GOOD AFTERNOON, SHERIFF.
NO DUST TODAY.
ANOTHER ONE
JUST RODE
INTO TOWN.
YOU SURE?
YOU CAN'T MISS
A PROFESSIONAL GUNFIGHTER.
HE'S GOT A LOOK
ABOUT HIM LIKE NOBODY ELSE
AND HE'S BEEN
ASKING AROUND FOR YOU.
I'M SURE GETTING
SICK OF THIS.
IT WOULD MAKE
ME SICK, TOO.
COME ON.
WHY DO THEY ALWAYS
HIT TOWN AT MEALTIME?
ARE YOU GOING
TO KILL SOMEONE?
WE HOPE IT
TURNS OUT THAT WAY.
IT'S A CHILDISH WAY FOR
A GROWN MAN TO MAKE A LIVING.
GO FOR YOUR GUN.
YOU GO TO HELL.
AND STAY OUT!
IF EITHER OF YOU
OPENS HIS STUPID MOUTH,
I'LL CHASE YOU
RIGHT OUT OF TOWN.
LEAVE
THE BOTTLE.
NOW HE'S
DONE IT.
WHO?
THAT SHERIFF.
WHAT'S
HE DONE?
HE'S PUSHED ME
TOO FAR THIS TIME.
I'VE BEEN BENDING
OVER BACKWARDS.
BUT THAT'S
ALL FINISHED.
I'VE BEEN BENDING
OVER BACKWARDS.
HE HASN'T
PUSHED YOU
INTO NO CORNER
WHERE YOU COULD BE PROVOKED
INTO LOSIN' YOUR TEMPER.
I'M TIRED
OF BEING
A NICE FELLOW.
PA,
YOU BEEN TOUCHING
UP YOUR HAIR AGAIN?
AGAIN?
IT JUST LOOKS
BETTER IN SPOTS.
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN SPOTS?
NOTHING.
WHAT'S
NEXT, PA?
GET JOE
OUT OF JAIL.
HOW?
LEAVE
THAT TO ME.
I GOT IT
FIGURED OUT.
WE'LL DO IT TONIGHT.
GET READY.
THIS WILL HAPPEN
AWFUL FAST.
PA.
HUH?
NOTHING.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WHEN I YELL GO,
WE ALL GO TOGETHER.
AND USE
YOUR SPURS.
READY?
AH-HA!
NOW HE'S
REALLY DONE IT!
WHO?
THAT SHERIFF!
I KNEW IT
WOULDN'T WORK.
WHY NOT?
THEY SET THESE
BARS IN TOO SOLID.
HOW DO
YOU KNOW?
I HELPED SET THEM.
LOOK,
ROUND UP
THE HORSES.
RIDE OVER
TO UNCLE MILT'S.
BRING STEVE,
GEORGE, AND YOUNG MILT.
AND TOM,
YOU RIDE OUT
TO UNCLE IRA'S.
TELL HIM TO BRING
BILLY, JACK,
AND ANYONE ELSE
HE CAN THINK TO BRING.
NO MORE
FOOLIN' AROUND.
THAT'S A
TWO-DAY RIDE
TO UNCLE IRA'S.
I KNOW HOW FAR IT IS!
GO PICK UP SOME GRUB.
WE'LL MEET
AT THE RANCH FRIDAY.
IF THEY DON'T
WANT TO COME,
REMIND THEM THAT
I'M HELPING THEM
TO PAY THEIR
MORTGAGES.
GET GOING!
YOU HELPED
PUT ON THEM BARS?
I DIDN'T HAVE
NOTHING ELSE TO DO.
AND THEY
WAS GONNA
PUT THEM ANYWAY.
THEY WILL
HANG YOU ANYWAY.
PA, I DON'T THINK
THEY'LL HANG ME.
THEY LAUGH ABOUT IT,
BUT I DON'T THINK
THEY'LL REALLY DO IT.
YOU'LL SEE--
DON'T MOVE.
WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE?
THAT'S
ALL I NEED,
SOME STABLE
BUM ORDERING
ME AROUND.
I'M TAKING
MY SADDLE WITH ME.
IT AIN'T
MINE, SO GO AHEAD.
IN A FEW DAYS,
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.
WERE THEY TRYING
TO BUST YOU OUT?
YEAH.
PA'S GOT A
HEART AS BIG
AS THE OUTDOORS,
BUT HE DON'T
HAVE ONE BRAIN
IN HIS
POOR OLD HEAD.
MAY I
COMPLIMENT YOU
ON SUCH A
ROMANTIC IDEA,
MISS PRUDY?
THERE'S NOTHING
ROMANTIC ABOUT IT.
NOTHING ROMANTIC ABOUT
A RIDE ON A WARM AFTERNOON?
YOU THINK
WHAT YOU WANT.
BUT YOU'D
DO THAT ANYWAY.
YOU'VE GOTTEN TO
KNOW ME IN
SUCH A SHORT TIME.
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TALK A MINUTE?
ALL RIGHT.
LIGHT YOURSELF UP
A CIGAR, SHERIFF.
THANK YOU,
MISS PRUDY.
I BELIEVE
I WILL.
WAS THERE
ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR
THAT YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?
WELL, IN CASE
YOU DIDN'T KNOW,
MILT DANBY
IS ROUNDING UP
HIS TWO BROTHERS
AND ALL THEIR SONS.
THEY'RE GOING
TO RIDE INTO TOWN.
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE CARE
OF YOU AND JAKE
AND GET JOE
OUT OF JAIL.
I HEARD
ABOUT THAT.
WE'VE BEEN
TRYING TO REMEMBER.
WE THINK THERE ARE
3 GROWN BOYS
IN IRA'S FAMILY
AND 2 IN
MILT'S FAMILY.
WITH THE 3 DANBYS HERE
AND JOE IN JAIL,
THAT
MAKES ABOUT 11.
PLUS SOME
HIRED HANDS.
THAT'S ABOUT
THE FIGURE
I ARRIVED AT,
TOO, 10 OR 12.
OR 14
OR 15 MAYBE.
IT'S QUITE A FEW.
ALMOST A MOB,
YOU MIGHT SAY.
HAVE YOU
FIGURED WHAT
YOU'LL DO?
MORE OR LESS.
WHAT?
I THOUGHT
I MIGHT LEAVE TOWN.
GET OUT OF TOWN
BEFORE THEY RIDE IN.
JUST KEEP
ON GOING.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
WHY NOT?
I'VE NEVER MADE
ANY SECRET OF THE FACT
THAT I'M ON
MY WAY TO AUSTRALIA.
I DON'T THINK I'LL FIND
A BETTER TIME
TO GET STARTED
THAN RIGHT NOW.
BESIDES,
I DON'T LIKE THE ODDS.
I JUST DON'T
BELIEVE IT.
YOU BETTER
BELIEVE IT.
BEFORE TOO
MANY HOURS,
YOU'LL LOOK UP
AND I'LL BE GONE.
THAT'S ONE
OF THE MOST
MATURE THINGS
I'VE EVER HEARD
OF A MAN DOING.
YOU THINK
IT'S WHAT?
MATURE.
ANY OTHER MAN
WOULD STICK AROUND
TO PROVE
HE'S A MAN
AND GET A WHOLE
TOWN SHOT UP.
MATURE?
MATURE,
AS OPPOSED
TO CHILDISH.
YOU DON'T THINK
IT SOUNDED COWARDLY?
I MEAN, I TAKE
A JOB AND THEN
WHEN THE GOING GETS ROUGH,
I SNEAK OUT
IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT.
YOU DIDN'T SAY
THE DAY OR NIGHT.
BUT THE POINT IS
DIDN'T IT SOUND
A LITTLE COWARDLY TO YOU?
NO, IT SOUNDS MATURE.
IT SOUNDED
A LITTLE COWARDLY
TO ME JUST NOW.
IT'S MATURE.
I KNOW
IT'S COWARDLY
BECAUSE I'VE
NEVER DONE
A COWARDLY THING
IN MY LIFE,
NO MATTER
WHAT YOU THINK.
I DIDN'T--
IT ISN'T MATURE.
IT IS COWARDLY.
LET'S JUST CALL
THINGS BY THEIR NAME.
WHAT IS THE MATTER?
I'M SURPRISED
YOU'RE THROWING
YOURSELF AT A MAN
YOU THINK IS A COWARD.
GO BACK TO TOWN.
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN
THROWING
MYSELF AT YOU?
DID YOU REALLY
THINK I'D RUN?
THAT'S WHAT
YOU JUST SAID.
I'M NOT
GOING TO,
SO YOU JUST
FORGET ABOUT IT.
ALL RIGHT.
ORDER!
ORDER!
YOU HEARD
THE MOTION.
THOSE IN FAVOR,
RAISE YOUR HANDS.
COUNT, HENRY.
1, 2, 3, 4,
5.
NOW,
THOSE IN FAVOR
OF NOT GETTING INVOLVED
IN THIS CRISIS
ABOUT TO BEFALL ON
OUR FAIR COMMUNITY.
KEEPING THE HELL
OFF THE STREETS
TILL THE SHOOTING IS OVER,
RAISE YOUR HANDS.
COUNT 'EM, HENRY.
5, 10, 15...
I THINK WE
PASSED THE MOTION.
ORDER!
ENTER IT
IN THE BOOKS
THAT THE MAJORITY HAS RULED
AND AS YOUR MAYOR--
I OBJECT!
GET THAT GUN
AWAY FROM HER.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
SHUT UP
AND SIT DOWN.
THIS IS A MEETING
OF THE TOWN COUNCIL,
WITH CERTAIN
PROMINENT CITIZENS.
YOU CAN'T WALK IN
AND INSULT EVERYONE.
I HAVE
ONE QUESTION.
WILL YOU
HELP THE SHERIFF
AGAINST
THE DANBYS?
IT'S NOT
AS SIMPLE
AS THAT.
WHY NOT?
THERE ARE
ECONOMIC FACTORS
TO CONSIDER.
IT COULD AFFECT
THE WHOLE TOWN.
I HEARD THE SHERIFF
IS LEAVING TOWN.
YES, AND THE SHERIFF'S HEAD
SETS SQUARELY ON HIS SHOULDERS.
NOW HE'S NOT
LEAVING TOWN.
I WANT TO KNOW
WHO CAUSED HIM
TO CHANGE HIS MIND.
THAT MAN HAD
A GOOD IDEA.
WHAT IS THE
MATTER WITH YOU?
WE WAITED SO LONG
FOR A MAN WHO WOULD
STAND UP TO THE DANBYS.
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT THIS TOWN WAS LIKE
BEFORE THE SHERIFF?
MURDERING, LYNCHING,
MINERS SHOOTING UP THE TOWN,
ASIDE FROM
THE FEW THINGS
YOU MENTIONED,
IT WASN'T
A BAD PLACE.
THE MISUNDERSTANDINGS
WITH THE DANBYS
COULD BE
WORKED OUT.
WHAT ABOUT
JOE DANBY'S
MURDER CHARGE?
THAT WOULD SOLVE ITSELF
IF THE SHERIFF LEFT TOWN.
I SAID IT BEFORE
AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN,
THE MEN IN THIS TOWN
ARE NOTHING BUT A BUNCH OF
MISERABLE, COWARDLY CURS.
AS YOUR FATHER,
I HAVE TO TAKE THAT.
BUT AS THE
MAYOR OF THIS TOWN,
I SURE AS HELL DON'T.
THROW HER OUT, BOYS!
AND DON'T BE TOO
GENTLE WITH HER.
DON'T LET HER TIE
HERSELF TO THE POST!
IT'S A TRICK
OF HERS,
TYING HERSELF
TO THINGS.
DEATH TO ALL TYRANTS!
WHAT DID
SHE SAY?
SHE SAID DEATH
TO SOMEBODY OR OTHER.
SHE ALWAYS
SAYS DEATH
TO SOMEBODY SHE'S MAD AT.
ORDER! ORDER!
FORGET ABOUT
GETTING HELP
FROM THIS TOWN,
OR FROM ANYBODY
FOR 100 MILES AROUND.
THAT'S JUST
ABOUT EVERYBODY.
THEY CAN THROW
GIRLS OUT OF MEETINGS
BUT THEY CAN'T
DEFEND THEIR OWN TOWN
AGAINST A BUNCH
OF CUTTHROATS.
WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO NOW?
WE?
DON'T TURN
DOWN HELP.
HOW IS JOE?
HE FIGURES
HE'LL BE OUT SOON.
DID HE SEEM SORRY
THAT WE MIGHT BE KILLED?
NO.
HE PLANNED
TO SPIT ON OUR GRAVES.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE JOE.
LEAVING TOWN
WAS A GOOD IDEA.
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO STAY.
YES, I DO.
I TOOK THE JOB.
SO DID I.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
I'LL GO TO AUSTRALIA
WITH YOU IF WE LEAVE NOW.
WE'LL GO
TO AUSTRALIA,
BUT FIRST WE GOT
A FEW THINGS TO DO.
PRUDY, WOULD
YOU STILL HELP?
SURE.
THE FIRST
THING TO DO
IS GET JOE
OUT OF HERE.
I GOT A COUPLE
OF IDEAS,
WE MIGHT LIVE
THROUGH THIS THING.
I SURE LIKED
HIS IDEA ABOUT LEAVING.
YOU GO IN
THE COURTHOUSE.
DO YOU KNOW
HOW TO USE THIS?
HERE, YOU'LL
NEED THESE.
JAKE,
ARE YOU THERE?
YEAH.
YOU KNOW
WHAT TO DO?
OH, YEAH!
KEEP OUT OF
THE LINE OF FIRE.
MAYOR...
CAN'T TALK
NOW, SHERIFF.
WE HAVE
AN EMERGENCY
MEETING.
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?
I WON'T SHOOT
THROUGH THE WINDOW.
TAKE CARE
OF THESE,
MY EATING TEETH.
I DON'T WANT TO
GET THEM SHOT UP.
GET JOE.
HE AIN'T IN THERE.
HOLD IT!
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
THROW DOWN YOUR GUNS
AND I'LL ACCEPT YOUR SURRENDER.
CAN'T YOU JUST
WOUND SOMEBODY?
I ONLY
SHOOT TO KILL.
WE DON'T
WANT A MASSACRE.
HOLD IT!
HOLD IT!
JUST HOLD IT!
GO AHEAD!
WHERE'S JOE?
UPSTAIRS.
GO GET HIM.
PA, LOOK.
YOUR TEETH
SAVED MY LIFE.
ALWAYS WORRYING
ABOUT YOURSELF.
HOW AM I
SUPPOSED
TO CHOW NOW?
LOOK!
I WANT YOU
TO UNSTRAP
YOUR GUN BELTS
AND THROW
YOUR RIFLES DOWN,
OR I'M GOING
TO SET THIS OFF.
YOU CAN'T BLUFF
ME OUT WITH THAT
OLD CANNON.
IT AIN'T
EVEN LOADED.
SHALL WE SEE?
BELIEVE HIM, PA!
STAY OUT OF
THIS, YOU
MISERABLE COWARD.
WHAT'S IT GOING
TO BE, DANBY?
JAKE, LET
JOE LOOSE.
PUT THE REST
OF THAT BUNCH IN JAIL.
BY MYSELF?
I'LL BE
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
WERE YOU
REALLY GOING
TO BLOW HIM UP?
THAT THING
ISN'T LOADED.
I JUST STUCK
THAT FAKE FUSE IN THERE.
SEE?
WOW!
MY BUSINESS!
I'LL FIND OUT
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS, MADAME ORR.
DISTURBING THE PEACE,
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU'RE CLEANING
UP THIS TOWN.
THAT WAS
A TERRIBLE
THING TO DO
TO THEM POOR
UNFORTUNATE GIRLS.
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT THING WAS LOADED.
I'VE NEVER
DONE ANYTHING
TO AN UNFORTUNATE
GIRL IN MY LIFE.
AW!
THOSE GIRLS
ARE MY FRIENDS.
WHO HAVE WE HERE?
IT'S THE SHERIFF.
IT'S THE
SHERIFF, BOYS.
EVERYBODY
IN THE TERRITORY
KNOWS WHO
OUR SHERIFF IS.
I GUESS HE' S
RIGHT AT THAT.
YOU'RE ABOUT THE
MOST POPULAR CITIZEN
WE'VE GOT AROUND HERE.
THAT'S NICE
TO HEAR.
WE'RE THINKING
ABOUT SENDING
A DELEGATION
TO WASHINGTON.
WE WANT YOU TO
HEAD THAT DELEGATION.
NO, NO.
YOU WANT SOMEBODY
WHO WILL BE HERE.
IF YOU'RE
UPSET WITH US
ABOUT THAT
DANBY BUSINESS--
WE WERE
BEHIND YOU
ALL THE WAY, SHERIFF.
I CAN SEE IT MIGHT NOT
HAVE  LOOKED THAT WAY.
NO, THAT'S NOT IT.
I'VE NEVER
HIDDEN THE FACT
THAT I'M GOING
TO AUSTRALIA.
WHICH REMINDS ME,
I'M GOING TO THINK
ABOUT GETTING STARTED AGAIN
ONE OF THESE DAYS.
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?
A SMALL CRISIS
NEEDS TO BE HANDLED.
JUMP, MISS PRUDY!
JUMP!
BOYS, I WANT
YOU TO KNOW THAT
FROM NOW ON WHEN YOU
PICK ON THIS YOUNG LADY,
YOU'LL BE
PICKING ON MY GIRL.
WE HAD NO IDEA.
NOW YOU KNOW IT.
SPREAD THE
WORD AROUND.
YES, SIR.
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN YOUR GIRL?
FOR ONCE, KEEP
YOUR MOUTH SHUT.
KEEP OUT
OF THIS.
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN?
YOU'VE HAD THAT
LOOK IN YOUR EYE
SINCE I
HIT TOWN.
LET'S HAVE A
LITTLE AGREEMENT.
AFTER
WE'RE MARRIED,
WHEN I SAY
WE'RE OFF TO AUSTRALIA,
WE PACK
UP AND GO.
WHY WOULD I
GO TO AUSTRALIA?
THAT'S WHERE YOUR
HUSBAND WOULD BE.
OH.
WHEN YOU
PUT IT THAT WAY...
WHY DON'T YOU
PUT ME DOWN?
OH, I LIKE
IT LIKE THIS.
YOU WANT ME
TO WALK YOU HOME?
IF YOU
WANT TO.
SO...
ARE YOU REALLY
ONE OF THE RICHEST GIRLS
AROUND HERE?
THE RICHEST.
WELL, THAT'S NICE.
THAT'S REAL NICE.
NOW, THE WAY
THIS STORY ENDS
IS THAT THEY
GET MARRIED.
HE BECOMES
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE.
NEVER GETS
TO AUSTRALIA,
BUT HE READS
A LOT OF BOOKS ABOUT IT.
I GET TO BE
SHERIFF OF THIS TOWN,
AND BECOME ONE OF
THE MOST BELOVED CHARACTERS
IN WESTERN FOLKLORE.
