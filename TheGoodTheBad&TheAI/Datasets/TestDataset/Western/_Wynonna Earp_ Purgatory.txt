-How did it go? -That bathroom
is a crime against humanity.
Trust me: put down the coffee.
It's gone cold anyways.
Never gone this long
between hipster coffee shops.
First time out West?
Next stop's mine.
You live here?
No, not anymore.
Funeral. My Uncle's.
I'm Kiersten. What did you say
your name was again?
There's so many of them! You
said they can't attack the house!
-They figured out how to
get around the bedrock!
- I got the gun, Daddy.
Let's close our eyes and
sing Mama's lullaby.
Just until the bad guys go away.
- DADDY!
Oh, Christ!
That's it, I'm gonna burst.
No.
Time to introduce
Chestnut Latte to the badlands.
Kiersten,
-don't go out there.
-Why?
It's dark.
Pretty and smart.
We're gonna get
along just fine.
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.
Whoa!
Hello?
What's going on?
Sit down.
Everyone, sit down.
We're leaving.
I've heard this before.
-Wolves?
-Something's outside.
Yeah, a passenger!
-We have to do something!
-Yeah, drive!
-Come on!
-We can't just leave her!
: You'd have
to be nuts to go out there.
Let's go!
Come on!
Assholes!
HEY!
If you hurt her,
I'll kill you!
Kiersten?
Let her go! We're armed!
Poorly.
Oh, my god!
Aaah! Ugh!
Aaah!
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
Ugh!
Head rush.
AAAH! AH!
Haha!
Something's
happening to me
Something's happening to me
Welcome home, Wynonna.
Something's happening to me
I feel myself changing
And face it
What I want, what I want, what
I want, what I want, yeah
'Cause I gave you
all I've got to give
And no,
that ain't no way to live
I told that devil
To take you back
I told that devil
to take you back
- Where exactly?
-Just outside the city limits.
-And the cause again?
-Maybe... animal attack.
-OK. And your name is?
-My name?
Nope.
Curtis was not
a handsome man.
When I first lay eyes
on him at the cookout,
I said to my sister,
"Just how closely related
are his parents?
But he was loyal.
Traits folk nowadays
might find old-fashioned...
...boring.
Thing is, with Curtis,
I was never bored.
Not once.
What are you doing here?
Salt of the earth
You're late, as usual.
I'm so sorry, Gus.
I thought you were
in Spain.
Greece, when I heard.
We'll make love, baby
Listen, I know Purgatory's
country and all,
but is that legal to bury
your husband in the garden?
Only thing Curtis loved
more than me
was his tomatoes.
Who am I to separate soulmates?
They said it was a stroke.
Bullshit! He was still
tossing hay bales
-like a teenager.
-Champ was
with him, but he didn't see
what happened.
Hardy "Rodeo Champ" Champ?
Yeah. He's a good kid.
Gus, when they found Curtis,
was he still
intact?
-Wynonna!
-I just want
-to find out what happened.
-He died.
Please, Wynonna, let it go.
For once.
It was a really nice eulogy.
Runaway? Whore? Who knows
what kind of trouble
this girl got herself into?
Spoken like a man who finds
a lot of dead girls.
And you've had three of 'em
in the past six months.
So you find
"Kiersten's" head yet?
Which agency did you
say you were from?
See those skid marks?
This isn't the kill site.
Driver said two of 'em
got off the bus.
OK, so where's the other body?
And these lacerations
defensive wounds?
Bite marks
from scavengers. We have
an overpopulation of coyotes
this summer. Winter will
thin out the pack.
You plan to be here
that long, Mister?
Dolls. Deputy
Marshal Dolls.
And I'll be here
as long as it takes.
Well, then welcome
to the bustling
metropolis of Purgatory where
nothing lives but cattle
-and cowboys.
-And maybe...
...the occasional
Greek goddess.
What'll I tell the locals
happened out here?
Runaway hooker.
Coyote attack.
Anything but
the truth, right?
Bringing down
the brass tacks
We get enough of speed
I'm gonna blow
the roof off this house
I'm gonna say
exactly what I mean
I wanna see
the look on your face
When you find out
that love's a lie
Well, either I'm sucking
fumes out of the back
of Willie Nelson's tour bus
or Wynonna Earp
just walked into my bar.
Hey, Shorty.
How's business?
Mechanical bull
broke a month ago.
Chippendales' night was a bust.
Not to mention this shit
about a dead runaway.
Rule number 1:
-You never get off the bus.
-I did.
You were there?
Did you tell the cops?
Why I'm here. Phoned
it in anonymously.
Uh-huh.
Two stints in juvie, a summer
riding with the Banditos,
and I'm still wanted for
questioning in the Bleaker case.
My relationship
with law enforcement
complicated.
How about
of liquid courage?
Alright, just one, yeah.
I gotta focus. I'm here for Gus,
and Curtis.
Somebody knows what really
happened to my uncle.
Where have
you been, Wynonna?
As far from here
as I could get.
Lucky you. If I could leave
Purgatory, I'd never come back.
Why would Wyatt Earp choose
to settle in this shithole?
My money's
on the deep genepool.
Well, maybe your
great-great-grandpappy
got a few lucky shots in
at the OK Corral
and fled before they found out
he was a fraud.
Didn't he marry a whore?
-An actress.
-Oh, oh, shit!
She's probably the one who gave Doug
Holliday the clap that done him in.
Hahaha!
Doc! Doc Holliday, dumbass.
And it was tuberculosis
that killed him, you ignoramus.
This coming from the pair
of tits so insane,
-so cursed?
-What did you say?
Getting beat up
by a girl again, Carl?
Champ!
My hero.
-Sweet.
-Listen, uh,
I was hoping
I could talk to you
about what happened
to my uncle.
Bring those lips, we can, uh,
"talk" all night long.
You didn't pay me
a second glance in high school.
Hey, you were kind of a freak.
You have no idea.
Well...
Shorty lets you stay
above the bar, huh?
Yeah, I, uh...
got a key.
Oh, it's impressive.
Ooof.
So, ummm...
You ran ranch security
with Curtis, but didn't bother
to make his service?
Yeah, I, uh,
hate funerals.
Ugh! Tell me about it.
Gus mentioned you were
the one who found his body.
-Yeah. Speaking of bodies.
-Hmm?
Mad hot.
Alright, Champ.
Yeah. Maybe it wasn't
such a good idea.
-Do you know what time it is?
-Yeah.
-Time for you to tell me how Curtis died.
-He-he just did!
Oh no. Don't make me get rough!
This ain't rough?
Look, uh, I heard screaming
and screaming, and I ran.
Called the Sheriff.
And when they found him, his
head had been torn clean off!
Listen, you washed-up
rodeo clown.
Who did it? What did you see?
Cattle mutilations,
lights in the hills,
strange marks in the dirt. OWWW!
He died on your land, Wynonna!
The homestead?
Show me where.
I'm not going back there.
You're in this
with me now, "Champ."
And no one else
is gonna save you.
Oh! Except his girlfriend,
you skank!
Why don't you slip
into something more comfy, huh?
Like a coma!
Worst birthday ever!
Wynonna?
Hey, sis.
You grew out your
hair.
Did you plant
our birthday gifts?
-Oh yeah.
-Haha!
Oh, hey, Carl.
I heard you talked
to Wynonna
at Shorty's. Brought up
the Earp Curse.
I didn't mean nothing.
We can't have you
running off your mouth
before we get
what we need. Can we, pal?
-C'mon, Malcolm.
-Hehe!
If you can't hold
your tongue.
Oh.
I will.
Now we stick to the plan,
then we kill the girls.
Got it? Got it?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-What are you doing in town?
I mean, besides my boyfriend?
-I wasn't gonna "do" anyone,
least of all that man-child. I'm trying
to find out what happened to Curtis.
-Oh, and you can do better.
-Small town,
-limited dating options.
-Yeah. I remember.
-Hey! God!
-Ow!
-What?
-It's been three years.
God! Come here!
You couldn't tell me
you were coming?
I wasn't.
Then, Uncle Curtis
sent me an email.
What? What did it say?
"They've caught up with me."
I knew it wasn't a stroke.
It's starting again, isn't it?
We need that gun.
-OK, I'm not doing this.
-Wyatt Earp's gun.
-Same one disappeared the night--
-Told you, never talk about it!
-And I don't!
-Good!
Best advice you ever gave me.
-Well... only advice, really.
-Hey, I was a kid!
OK? I couldn't...
I couldn't look
after myself, let alone--
What, your bratty
little sister?
You know, it's about
the only thing
-I've ever done right.
-Leaving me behind?
-Yeah, it gave you a chance.
-Right.
Yeah, well,
I'm not 6 anymore, OK?
Look, I could help.
We could fight
this thing,
this curse together!
Waverly, there is
no curse on--
Wynonna Earp?
If my parole officer's
asking, then no.
Is there somewhere
that we can go talk?
We got your call.
And I think that this
belongs to you.
So, you wanna tell me
exactly what happened
on that bus?
Am I being charged
with something?
'Cause, trust me, having to ride
the bus is punishment enough.
A girl is dead... Ms. Earp.
-I had nothing to do with that.
-I know.
I spoke to the bus driver.
He was scared.
He said he heard something that spooked
him, and that you and Kiersten were
-the only ones that fled the bus.
-I'm sorry, I'm, uh...
-Drunk?
-Lost.
Are you FBI? I didn't quite
recognize the badge.
And you've seen a lot of them
given your criminal record.
Juvenile record.
And that's supposed to be sealed
when an offender turns 18,
and I'm 26.
-27.
-Happy birthday.
By the way.
U.S. Marshals, huh?
You don't have
jurisdiction up here.
Cross-border task force.
What's with the charcoal star?
Good eye. Denotes
the Black Badge Division.
Is that some kind
of covert branch?
We monitor specific activity
that has recently flared up
-in this area.
-What kind of activity?
Unexplainable.
I either need
way more or way less
of this stuff, I'll tell ya.
You know what I think, Earp?
I think you saw
what killed Kiersten.
Yeah. Coyote, a big one.
Is that the story
you're sticking with?
Where'd your sister go?
You leave her out of this.
I just want to thank her
for my coffee.
You see, the thing is, Wynonna,
our division doesn't really
see a lot of survivors,
so any information that you have
on how you outran--
Yeah, I got
your card. Thanks.
I'm sure you're getting this
all the time,
but is it like "Earp" as in...
Good ole Wyatt. Yep.
He was my great-
great-grandfather.
The greatest gunslinger
that ever lived.
You a good shot too?
I don't do guns.
Couldn't hit a lawman
at zero paces.
Fortunately.
He seems nice.
As a swift kick to the box.
So... your 27th birthday.
It doesn't mean
anything, Waverly.
Oh yeah Then why
do you look so spooked?
Huh?
-Tell Gus I'm taking the truck.
-What?
-Where are you going?!
-Home.
They say Wyatt took down
77 outlaws with this gun.
And all those outlaws
are resurrecting as revenants
-coming for us.
-They won't rest until
they gain freedom
from their earthly prison.
-You'll stop them, Daddy!
-You'll get 'em.
Willa is the eldest,
the next Earp heir destined
to inherit Wyatt's abilities.
Because the only thing
that can put these demons
down again is you.
-You said they can't attack the house!
-They figured out how to get
-around the bedrock!
-Got the gun! So many of them!
There's seven of them!
Willa!
-Shotgun won't work.
-He needs Wyatt's gun.
-I won't let them hurt anyone.
-Good.
Because the only thing
that can put
these demons down again is you.
Waverly was right.
We need that gun.
And I'm talking to my truck.
Good news:
she took the bait.
She'll fetch it for us.
Were you gonna ask
to borrow my stuff?
I noticed you already
borrowed all my whiskey.
I know Curtis may have
stood for all that,
but then, he was soft on you.
He was a good man, and he deserved
better than what happened to him.
Something took his head, Gus.
-Something or someone.
-Oh, Wynonna.
-I know who killed him, and I got
a plan -That's not what I meant.
You got that wild look
in your eyes.
You're manic, paranoid.
Probably off your meds, hm?
What's next?
More demons?
Yeah, I might
be certifiable.
Got the paperwork
to prove it.
But something awful
is happening in Purgatory,
and it has everything to do
with my last name!
You're not
the only Earp in town.
Waverly has worked so hard
just to get out
from under your shadow.
-I know it's your birthday so--
-Don't worry about that.
Enough for a one-way
ticket back to Athens.
So this is your gift for me?
And for your sister.
I love you, Wynonna
but you're as broken
as they come.
Hello, Earp.
Thirsty?
No. This old well
dried up a long time ago.
Much like my tolerance
for stalkers.
No, really,
are you following me?
-Happened to be driving by.
-Well, if you wanted a date...
-I don't.
-Ouch.
But I might be the one person
that can help you.
Thanks, but I'm more of a
make-everything- worse kind of gal.
Gonna get worse. You think
the thing that killed Kiersten
is just gonna let you live?
Not if I'm already gone.
Earp, I know
what you know.
OK. Well, you don't
know me, Deputy.
Talk to the locals,
they'll tell you.
Yeah, that you're mental,
a bad seed. Mm-hmm.
Aw, you forgot
scary good in bed.
What do you want from me?!
I need someone that knows
the area, its people.
I want you to join my squad.
Work for the right side
of the law for once.
-You must be desperate.
-The situation's desperate.
OK. Well, I don't
do authority, alright?
These days, I barely do sober.
Then I recruit Waverly.
People in town rave about her.
I told you to leave
her out of this!
Clearly, I'm talking
to the wrong sister.
Yeah, you're all talking
to the wrong sister!
They took the good
one into the hills
-and slaughtered her!
-What was her name?
Willa. I saw what being
law did to my father.
Whatever you've heard
getting deputized's
what did him in.
My bosses consider what's happening
here in Purgatory urgent,
and they will do whatever it
takes to protect their interests.
Well, good for them.
So, what did you go down an old
dried-up well to get, Earp?
Don't follow me again.
Had it up to here
with surprises.
WILLA!
You can't help!
You aren't the heir!
Shotgun won't work.
He needs Wyatt's gun.
No! No!
No! No!
No!
Argh! Ugh!
DADDY!
Get ready for awesome,
little Cindy.
OK, maybe if I get
a little closer.
Shit!
The black sheep returns.
Jesus!
Waddle along now, Nedley.
Sheriff. Sheriff Nedley.
You keeping your fluffy
hindquarters clean
or should I frisk you
for old times' sakes?
Wouldn't risk it. We both know
you're one grope away
from a heart attack.
Best stick to internet porn
and the certainty
of dying alone, don't you think?
Why'd you even
come back, Wynonna?
Haven't the people
who love you suffered enough?
Probably.
Waverly? Champ?
I told you.
I'm ready to help.
What the sweet hell is this?
That? That's just
the basics. Look.
Everything I could find
about our family.
You know, Wyatt Earp
the people he killed. Look.
You're supposed
to be normal, Waverly.
-You're supposed to be safe!
-Ow!
You know, I scoured
every library,
every archive in the country,
and you know what I never found?
A reason why
I can't break the curse.
OK. How about'cause
your scrapbooking habit
-has taken a terrible turn?
-Good one.
Oh, my God!
Is that Wyatt's gun?
You knew where it was
this whole time?
Yeah, I was 12.
Panicked, I threw it away.
My God, it's beautiful! Ow!
It's old, it doesn't
shoot straight,
and it's worth enough to buy us both
a chrome condo 5000 miles from here.
This is our home, Wynonna.
I'll protect it,
even if you won't.
-You'll die!
-Not if I have this!
-Look, we can use it
-Ow! We can use it
-to kill our enemies!
-"Enemies"?
Waverly, the only person
this gun ever killed was Daddy!
When I shot him!
-You were trying to save him.
-Ah?
-It was an accident.
-Yeah.
And it ruined my life!
Not gonna
let it ruin yours.
Pack this shit up. This time,
you're coming with me.
Oh, yeah, run!
Always do.
I'm serious. I'm taking the
Right.
You know, of all the things
I've ever wanted to call you
you're such a coward.
Don't forget fraud.
Mercy me.
Now is that what I think
it is, little lady?
Let me guess.
Wyatt Earp fan?
Came to see the place
where he drank?
You know what?
Let your freak flag fly free.
Oh, I am free.
Free as a bird,
and it's sublime.
OK.
I ain't seen a Buntline Special
in years. May I?
You may not.
I do reckon
I know that gun.
Wyatt Earp christened it
"Peacemaker."
You a collector?
Only of poker chips
and hearts.
Engraving his own initials?
Seems rather gauche.
Doc Holliday had it done
to celebrate
his best friend's 50th kill.
Sounds like
he was soft on Wyatt.
"Peacemaker." Haha!
It's pretty rich. Do you have
any idea how many people
he killed with that thing?
Are you implying
Wyatt Earp was a hypocrite?
I'm saying crazy runs
in the family.
My apologies.
I did not realize
I was speaking with an Earp.
Bona fide.
Yeah, I just figured
you were a prostitute.
Prostitutes get paid for it.
He was good at killing,
so they called him hero.
What kind of person
wants to be a gunslinger?
Wyatt Earp wanted
to be a farmer.
30 seconds in the OK Corral,
and a gunslinger he was made.
Sometimes, life chooses for us.
Your outfit's adorable.
Ma'am.
Gus? Just came to say goodbye.
Gus?
Gus?
Gus!
Oh, God!
They took Waverly.
You'll fix this.
He said,
"Tomorrow
high noon."
You're supposed to be following me! I
called the number on your card 50 times
I heard and
I'm very sorry about Gus.
-She's in intensive care.
-And I assure you,
-we are monitoring the situation.
-"Monitoring"?
I need to find
who took my sister.
You know who took your sister.
Officially, coyotes;
and unofficially, demons.
You said it.
You actually said...
Yes.
They had me committed.
They had me
sent away!
We can find them, Dolls.
How?
They can blend in.
They look just like us.
-You won't help my sister?
-Wynonna
she's already dead.
You don't even know
where they took her.
Sure, I do: where
this whole thing began.
Oh oh oh oh oh
-There gonna be trouble?
-If you don't move.
Shorty, I need the best
ride in your stable.
I got a young black beauty.
Packs a real sweet kick.
I am a bad woman
To keep making mad
I'm not here to please
Paint me in a corner,
but my colour comes back
I'm a black sheep
-Guess you missed your bus.
-Yeah, kind of over busses.
-Hanging in there?
-It's terrible!
YOU PRICKS ARE WORM FOOD NOW!
Aaah. One more step
and Little Sis
takes a short drop
into oblivion.
-You got a name, revenant?
-Well,
back in your great-great-
grandpappy's day,
I was known as Malcolm
Ramaker, entrepreneur.
-An outlaw.
-You know, I remember
the exact moment in 1866
when Wyatt Earp had me hung
for murdering
my business partner.
Too bad the hangman
didn't set
the noose very snug.
It took 14 long minutes
for me to die.
Yeah, and now you're back.
Yes! And not alone!
Boys!
I know you two. You're...
-You're local.
-Some of us are.
You see, when
the Earp heir turns 27,
those of us killed
by the last one,
well, we resurrect.
A little more demonic
than the time before, but,
one way or the other,
we all end up in Purgatory.
-Why'd you kill, Curtis?
-To lure you back.
Get you to fetch what we needed.
-Peacemaker.
-Hahaha!
Please, get us the gun.
Don't do it, they'll kill you!
They'll try.
Hey!
OK. OK.
Here goes. Look.
Alright?
All yours. Take the bike too.
John.
-OK?
-Oh, Lordy,
you are the most pathetic heir
we have ever had!
That's me.
Now cut her down!
You welch on a deal;
you don't get to ride.
-Somebody, shut her up!
-Carl, you grab Wynonna.
We're gonna have two dead Earps
for the price of one.
How the hell
do you start this thing?
Ah! Like this.
I am a bad woman
To keep making mad
I'm not here to please
Paint me in a corner,
but my colour comes back
-Deep breath, baby girl!
-What?!
- You never go back
-Now!
I'm a black sheep
I'm a black sheep
Once you go black,
you never go back
I'm a black sheep
Ah!
-You think you can best me?
-I am gonna
put you in the ground
like it's my job.
'Cause you know what?
-I'm starting to think it is.
-True, you may have
the one gun that could
bring me back to hell,
but I'm gonna take
your baby sister with me,
-you stupid, crazy bitch!
-Wanna know how batshit I am?
Nobody shoots my family, but me.
Oh!
You are the heir.
Sealed with a lead kiss.
-You OK, baby girl?
-Yeah.
-Alright.
-Oh, Jesus. OK.
CARL!
-Stupid Carl!
-How do I make this
freaking work?!
Ahhh, nuts!
What?
You brought backup?
-Oh!
-Yeah.
Hey, you came back for me.
Duh!
I'm nuts, remember?
Come on!
Get in!
Couldn't get
a bigger truck?
Nope!
-You good?
-Yeah.
I know you're
like a ghost
You come and go
Gus is getting
discharged tomorrow.
I put fresh flowers
in her bedroom.
God! What happened
to Wyatt Earp to make us
deserve this?
Keeps you alone
What if I told you
time was sleeping time
You're really staying
this time, aren't you?
That's why
they call it a curse.
Where you would go if you had
only one direction to take
Well, looks like
you're not the only one
sticking around.
- Our love, our secrets
-Big city, leather loafers:
douche.
- Even all our mistakes
-Great butt though.
Yep.
And even all our love
-Let's talk.
-You're serious?!
That's a first-degree
murder charge of Kiersten Lesko
and not to mention,
you're also wanted
for questioning
in an open B&E case.
-This is blackmail, you dick!
-This is big government.
You went up against demons twice
and you survived.
We want you.
-Get in line.
-So your first job is simple:
identify and eradicate
Wyatt Earp's kills
Revenants. My Daddy always
called them revenants.
Before they leave the territory
and have the chance
to slaughter every man, woman
and child in this country.
-They can't leave Purgatory.
-Oh, wait a minute.
Are you telling me
the demons are trapped here?
It's classified.
Cute.
Dolls, thank you
for coming for us.
you know, covering us
from the trees.
What if I told you
time was slipping
It's Deputy Marshal Dolls.
- Time was slipping away
-Things will go a lot smoother
-if you follow my lead.
- Where would you go
If you had
only one direction
I highly doubt that.
-And I'm picking my own team!
-Got a team.
Deputy.
Our love, our secrets,
we've been keeping
Even all our mistakes
Welcome to the Black
Badge Division.
And even all our love
Forever's not enough
He's actually
letting you stay here?
Well, it seems that way.
You'd be more comfortable
in town with your own kind.
I reckon I'm the only
one of my kind left.
Some of the boys
are claiming it was you
up in the hills who shot Carl,
provided cover
for the heir.
The heir to what?
Wynonna is one thing:
-a disgrace to the Earp name.
-I'm warning ya,
just keep to the outskirts.
And miss the reunion?
That's not a reunion
it's a war party.
Yah!
