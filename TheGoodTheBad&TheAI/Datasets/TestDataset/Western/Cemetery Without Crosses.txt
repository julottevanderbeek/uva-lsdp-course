Maria!
Ben!
Ben!
Let's go!
After anothers.
They burned the farm.
There's nothing left.
We gonna spend the night here.
We'll leave tomorrow.
Hold it.
They wounded Ben.
Nothing we could do to help him.
Do not blame us for his death.
This is your money.
What are you doing here?
Ben is dead.
Why?
Ben robbed transport with payment money
With Thomas and Will they killed everyone
who was transporting money.
Last time I saw you
I said it's going to end badly.
They didn't want to leave this place.
And the others?
Thomas and Will escaped.
They're hiding at my place.
Tell them to go across the border.
Otherwise they're dead.
And you too...
Ben was your friend.
It was long time ago.
Help me.
Ask your brothers.
You're the only one who
can get revange on Rogers.
I don't even know him.
That's why.
I'm not interested.
If you can't do it for him
do it for me.
Not for him, nor for you.
Don't want to get involved.
Then do it for this.
It's Ben's share.
What do you want me to do?
Whatever you want.
And if I'll refuse?
I'll do it myself.
That's all what I have left.
They will kill you.
I don't care!
I'll see you in 2 days.
Want a room?
Yes.
Sign the book.
A dollar for the room and 5 cents more
if you want to take a shower.
Bastard!
You promised me!
Get lost!
You have to pay up front.
Give me back my money!
Get out! Bitch!
Bastard!
I'll make you pay for it.
Come on, I take it
to your room
Now go. I do not want problems
with Rogers.
Buy me a drink?
You're new in town.
I saw you at the hotel.
Where is he?
There. In the corner.
Playing cards, with the girl.
I know him.
Be careful.
Half of  family is here.
Get out from here.
Stone.
Yes?
Well, my friend...
You think you can do whatever you want
because you're The Rogers.
Let me tell you one thing,
I'm not afraid of The Rogers.
Too bad he is not here.
But we'll get him.
It's good that you're Rogers.
You hanged Ben...
...but soon all your Family
is going to swing on the rope.
You're the main thug here.
Everybody knows it.
But everybody is afraid...
...that your Father's thugs
gonna burn their farms.
Take their cattle or simply kill them.
And the sheriff is on your payroll.
But, now...
... it will be over
You gonna face us.
We're The Vallees.
I'm warning you. I'm gourmet.
So you gonna have to share.
Now it's time for a small show
so you'd know who we are.
Don't do it Vallee. Don't do it.
If I were you...
But you're not me.
Stone.
Can you tell me who is he?
I have no idea and I lost my glasses.
Open the door!
Open or we'll break down the door!
You're arrested for the murder.
Let's go.
Give him to us, Sheriff.
I can't do it.
Four people were killed.
It was self-defense. We both
were there. We can be witnesses.
Then you know who he is.
Sure, he works for us.
Let him go.
My brothers and I will take care of it.
You better start looking for Caines.
My men are looking for them.
Release him.
You are being paid well.
If you're looking for troubles
we'll find them for you.
Well... What are you waiting for?
Wake up. You are free to go.
Working for Rogers for a long time?
OK.
I see.
Next time you will not have so much luck.
Self-defence or not...
Let's go.
Thank you, Sheriff.
Don't forget the Caines.
Come here.
My kids told me about you
and I am grateful.
Are you looking for a job?
It depends.
Of what?
Job.
You're new here, right?
Right.
He is not very talkative.
Doesn't like questions.
What's your name?
Manuel.
I have a good job as a foreman.
OK
Bud, he stays with you and George.
Johanna, this is Manuel.
He will be the new foreman.
Let's go.
I talked to Sheriff.
And...?
What she's doing?
I do not know.
We can not stay here.
It's dangerous.
They'll find us.
I go talk to her.
What did you decided?
I'll stay here.
We are going across the border tonight.
You can do whatever you want,
but in your place I would stay a day or two.
You are safe here.
I may need you.
Tom, look...
Get horses!
We are grateful for the blessings
we are about to receive, Lord. Amen
Looking for something?
Is it forbidden to walk?
No. The boss just doesn't like anyone
to come close to the horses after dark.
What's your name?
Corey, sir.
You are the new foreman?
That's right.
I'm just following orders.
Okay. Good night.
Good night.
Upstairs.
What are you doing here?
Frank!
Do you want money?
No. Ben's share was enough.
Was enough for what?
To kidnap you daughter.
I paid the man to do that.
With your money, Rogers.
And now if you want to see
your daughter alive again...
...you will do exactly what I say.
Is that clear?
Three of my men did not return.
They were after the Caines.
They were going to your place.
What happened to them?
Leave her alone, Sheriff.
You can leave, Mrs. Caine.
I don't understand you, Rogers.
What did she wanted?
Dad. What are we going to do?
What happened?
Did it work?
What do you want to know?
What they decided.
Would they pay?
Yes. They'll pay a lot!
How much?
You need to leave tonight.
Before they come after him.
After who?
After Ben.
Ben? He's dead and buried!
You can't do much for him.
They're going to bury him at cemetary.
Whole Rogers family is going to
carry him to cemetary.
They'll provide whole ritual.
After they admit their crime
they'll get the girl back.
I don't need any money.
You are out of your mind.
You have no rights...
You should have told us before.
I would never do that.
Stop, Tom.
No! We do our way.
That's the last thing we can do for Ben.
Let's go. There's nothing for us here.
Men are like grass
and all the grass will die.
Look for us with mercy.
Give life to your children.
Despite the hate. The earth will swallow them
and the fire wiil consume them.
The enemy fells before the arms of Lord.
"Vanity, vanity," said Eclezias.
All is vanity.
My body screams for us all.
My heart is completely open.
Listen and give me comfort.
Save me and let my soul
find eternal rest.
It is written that everything has its time.
Time to be born
and time to die.
So be it.
"Vanity, vanity," said Eclezias.
All is vanity.
Maria sent us to take the girl
back to Rogers.
All is cleared up.
Maria and Rogers found agreement.
They agreed to exchange
the girl for the money.
You thought it over?
$2000.00 and the weapon.
Scum.
Your brother will die if you do not speak.
You touch my brother...
you'll never see the girl.
How do we know she's still alive?
Otherwise I'd never come here.
I'm not an idiot!
Talk, or...
If I'm not go back tonight he will kill her.
I'll make you talk!
That's enough!
Here're the money.
Bring her back.
Finally you come to senses.
Frank!
It is best to treat me nice, boy.
Money up front.
Complete trust.
I'm going Eli.
Good. I'll bring her to town.
No! You'll bring her here!
Your brother stays with us.
If she's not here by 11 o'clock,
you know what to expect.
Thomas!
Calm down, Eli.
We have the money and the girl.
Everything will work out.
So?
A deal.
Eli stays with you.
I do not want to meet you
at the ranch.
Not that I do not trust you.
Let's meet in town, it's closer to the border.
Okay. We will meet
at 11 o'clock at the church.
I'll be there.
Thomas!
I told you, Eli. Don't to worry.
I'll not leave you here.
Don't forget.
At 11 o'clock.
I placed my people. I stay here.
Go!
What are you going to do now?
I don't know.
"Now" has no meaning anymore.
You can't stay here.
The Rogers never forgive those who took their money.
You know what happened to me?
I'm tired, Manuel.
I am not afraid of anything.
I stopped having feelings.
There's nothing else.
Go home now.
I'll pick up tomorrow morning.
I'll take you north.
If you only want.
We do not need you.
Manuel will take you home.
I hope they'll kill you!
Tell us.
Who did this?
Better say or you'll end up
like your brother.
I don't know...
It's him...
Who?
Manuel.
Where did he take Johanna?
"The Ghost Town".
It's not him.
It's all Maria.
Let's go.
Maria!
Manuel.
My love.
You brought her back?
Yes.
They didn't believe it.
They thought she's dead.
Eli told them where
you're hiding.
They will find it.
Do not go back to "The Ghost Town".
Do not worry.
They wait for you over there.
I've heard them saying that.
They wait for nothing.
We are leaving now.
We go to a place I know up north.
Do not worry.
Manuel...
I wanted to tell you...
Come closer...
Leave me here...
I'm cold...
Leave this place...
I don't want you to get killed...
.
You know...
When we left...
First time...
I got scared I will not
see you anymore...
Never again...
