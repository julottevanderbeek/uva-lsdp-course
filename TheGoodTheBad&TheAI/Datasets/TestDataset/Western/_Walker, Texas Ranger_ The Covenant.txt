Hello.
- All right.
- Okay, come on.
Lupe, you've never been to a part\y
till you've been
to C.D.'s Christmas Eve part\y.
It will be busy?
Oh, everybody
and his dogs will be here.
You'll have to have an armored car
to carry away the tips.
Go inside, esé.
Come on.
Hey, compadre.
We're not properly open yet, fellas.
You got us all wrong, amigo.
We're not here to drink.
We're here to help.
Is that a fact?
Yeah, there's been some bad trouble
in the neighborhood.
So we're getting a collection together
to have a patrol.
That way nothing happens to you.
And your donation's
only a hundred dollars.
- Hundred dollars?
- Each week.
Oh, I don't think so.
What's that window wort\h to you?
And your customers?
Now, I'm sure you don't want
a bunch of greasy cholos
hassling them in the parking lot,
now, do you?
- Yeah.
- It's never been a problem before.
- Now, I get your point.
- Yeah, I thought you would.
Everybody pays, old man.
It's just better that way.
Not everybody. You just back away.
You're making a big mistake,
old man.
No, no, you're the one
who's making a mistake.
Got nine lives?
Because you're gonna need them.
You come back around here
one more time
and I'll plant this shotgun
so deep in your butt
they'll hear the echoes in Houston.
Mr. Parker, you'd better call the police.
Those kids are very dangerous.
Oh, no, no, no.
They just met up with the wrong man.
Can you get this kind of cleaned up,
hon, and put up some more garlands?
And I'm gonna
go get the ornaments.
Yessiree.
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Tra, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
We can't let an old man
punk us out like that, esé.
Who said we're gonna?
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Tra, la, la, la, la, la, la...
Yeah, but Lupe's new.
You know, maybe she's overreacting.
Well, it won't hurt\ to look into it.
These gangs are bad news.
Yeah, you're right.
You know, when we were kids,
we used to duke it out,
one-on-one, right?
Sometimes, rarely, but sometimes
somebody would pull out a knife.
Now these kids
got the cops outgunned.
It's C.D.
Dispatch, this is Trivette.
I need an ambulance in the alley
beside 429 Winston Street.
Trivette, he's hurt\ bad.
So the way I figure this thing, Cordell,
the guys that tried to shake me down,
run me down.
- Did you see anything, C. D?
- See anything?
Well, hell, no, I didn't see anything.
I just went across the alley,
singing a Christmas carol,
get the ornaments,
picked up the ornaments,
came back, went ass over teakettle.
Next thing I remember, the anvil
chorus is going off in my head.
Figure you're lucky to be alive,
Big Dog.
Then why don't I feel
that way about it?
I'm not gonna be able to go
to my Christmas part\y.
And that is damn import\ant to me.
C.D., Lupe can run the place
until you feel better.
She's right. What you need is rest.
That's not the point.
That's not the point at all.
All those punks hurt\ me
and put me in here.
Cordell, I could've took
any one of them
or all of them put together
with one hand tied behind me.
- There wasn't no question about that.
- Okay, just relax, C.D.
Trivette and I'll take care of this.
Let's go talk to the merchants
in the neighborhood.
If they tried to shake C.D. Down,
that means there had to be others.
- Nobody knows anything.
- Yeah, I know, they're all scared.
Means something's going on.
Yeah, why don't you get
with Sal Ochoa
from the Gang CRASH Unit?
- See what you can dig up.
- You got it.
- I'll see you tomorrow after class.
- How's the class going?
- It's going really good.
- Think you can make any difference?
Well, most of these kids
are from broken homes.
They've already got
two strikes against them.
All I'm trying to do
is keep them from striking out.
We can only build so many prisons.
Yeah, you're right about that.
These kids are at a crossroads,
Trivette.
We've gotta get them
on the right path.
Taking this pretty personally,
aren't you?
Damn right I am.
Put your arms out there. Wait.
Okay.
All right, fall in.
Ricardo.
- Where's your belt?
- I don't have it.
You know you've been training
for eight months. You're a purple belt.
You know you're supposed to have
your uniform and your belt at all times.
- Yes, sir.
- Then where's your belt?
My baby sister was killed
in a drive-by shooting,
and I put my belt in her coffin
for her to take to heaven.
Mr. Saenz, would you bring me
a purple belt, please?
Yes, sir.
- Okay, fall back into class.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Mr. Saenz,
would you take over, please?
Yes, sir.
- What are we?
- We are a team, sir.
- T stand for?
- Truth, sir.
- E stand for?
- Esteem, sir.
- A stand for?
- Attitude, sir.
- M stands for?
- Motivation, sir.
Three others necessary
to be a great mart\ial art\ist.
- Number one?
- Discipline, sir.
- Number two?
- Respect, sir.
- Number three?
- Instrument, sir.
- What can you become?
- Anything I wanna be, sir.
- Why?
- Because I'm a winner, sir.
Is being a winner
some tiny thing?
No, sir. No tiny thing, sir.
On your stance.
Ready.
Kick. Kick.
Peace.
Jab.
Jab.
Now, when you punch,
don't reach with your shoulder.
Keep your shoulder straight.
Now, punch.
Now, see how you're reaching?
See? See how he keeps
his body straight?
- You're dismissed.
- Thank you, sir.
- All right. See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.
Later.
I know, I know.
Hey, Tommy.
You're looking real good out there.
Yes, sir. Ernesto's been helping me.
Well, he's the man to do it.
He was one of my best students.
- How's his job going?
- He just got promoted to manager.
Getting him that job at Phil's Garage
is the best thing that happened to him.
The best thing that ever happened
to him was getting out of that gang.
How about you?
Are they hassling you?
No, sir.
Good.
Nope, nope.
Nope, nope.
How you feeling, C. D?
Cordell, I want out
of this tort\ure chamber.
Every time I look up,
they're drawing blood.
I'm tired and I hurt\. I want out.
You told me you're feeling better.
I don't feel wort\h a damn.
That's how I feel.
Any luck yet?
Nope, not yet.
Brother, when I spot him,
he's gonna stay spotted.
This is the guy, Cordell.
That's the one who tried
to put the bite on me, right there.
Sonny Port\illo, a.k.a. The Viper.
- Leader of the Vatos Locos.
- Where's he live?
Easy, C.D. Easy.
Just relax, C.D.
Leave Sonny Port\illo to me.
No. No.
But I only have 18 bucks, Ernesto.
Hey, that'll teach you
to blow your quart\ers on the arcade.
Hey, Ed, don't overt\ighten it.
I thought we were
into this together, man.
You were gonna get Mom
the candlesticks
and I was gonna get her
the tablecloth.
Hey, I already got her the candlesticks.
Hey, Ed, check the plugs on this.
Come on, Ernesto.
The one she wants costs 25 bucks.
I'm 7 bucks short\ and Christmas
is only three days away, man.
Calm down, man.
Listen, I'll tell you what.
You roll that barrel of oil
to the collection area,
then I'll lend you the 7 bucks.
- You got a deal.
- Hey, hey, don't forget,
we gotta pick out
that Christmas tree after work.
- All right.
- Okay? Hurry up.
How much longer?
Let's talk, homes.
I don't have anything
to say to you, man.
Come on, esé.
There's a war coming down.
You gotta be with us, homes.
We need you, esé.
Like I told them, man,
I don't wanna be with anybody.
Come on, homey,
gotta back up the barrio, esé.
Vatos Locos. We jumped them in.
Tonight's your initiation.
You could ride with us, esé,
against the Diamantes.
Hey, Tommy, everything okay?
Yeah.
Get back to the shop.
Do it.
Hey, I asked you
to stay away from Tommy.
Now, I'm telling you,
leave him alone.
Hey, homes,
we got jumped in together, esé.
You and me.
You got jumped out,
broke the covenant,
but I never gave you
any trouble about it, did I?
You don't want the clica, homes?
That's cool, esé. It's your choice.
But nothing's changed, homes.
- We still gotta back up the barrio.
- Hey, I changed.
Now Tommy's not getting into it,
and if you come near him again,
I'll take you apart\, esé,
right in front of the veteranos.
Don't get loud on me, cholito.
Yeah? And what
are you gonna do, esé?
Trust me, Ernie,
you don't wanna think about it.
Let's roll, esé.
Sonny Port\illo's been in more trouble
than John Dillinger,
but that was all before he was 18,
so we can't touch him.
- Why not?
- His juvenile jacket's been sealed.
Since he turned 19, the only thing
we've got him on is loitering.
The leader
of one of Fort\ Wort\h's biggest gangs
and all he's done is loiter?
Well, veteranos recruit
young cholitas and burros
to do their dirt\y work for them
and carry their guns.
- That's right.
- C.D. Identified him.
Yeah, but he didn't pay the extort\ion,
and he didn't see who ran him down.
I think I'll pick up
Sonny Port\illo anyway.
Won't be able to hold him,
but at least he'll know I'm in the hood.
Today you were ninos,
tonight you become veteranos.
Tonight we bleed the Diamantes.
Yeah! Now let's see
if those Diamantes
have the huevos to answer.
Yeah!
Hurry up.
Here, grab the end.
Grab the end, hurry up.
You came home?
Hi, Mom.
It's a beautiful tree.
It's even prettier than last year.
Hey, won't the angel
look great on top, Mom?
- Yeah.
- I get to put the angel on top this year.
Hey, you're always complaining.
No!
No! No!
No! Ernesto!
No! No! No!
Please God, no!
Los Diamantes,
they shot my brother.
Los Diamantes!
Tommy?
They shot Ernesto.
We were just carrying
the Christmas tree,
- and they shot him.
- Who shot him?
- The Diamantes.
- Are you sure?
They called it out,
and I recognized Guzman's wheels.
- I wish I had a gun.
- That's not the answer, Tommy.
I'll take care of the Diamantes.
Right now, your mother needs you.
She has a priest.
They can say a million Hail Marys
and they don't mean a thing.
They do mean a thing.
They mean a lot.
Mrs. Lopez,
your son's in the best of hands here.
It's in God's hands now.
Mrs. Lopez?
Your son's out of surgery.
He's in ICU.
- How is he?
- Well, he's critical. He's not conscious.
- Can I see him?
- Yes, sure.
Right there, for a few minutes.
First, we bury the placa,
then we bury the Vatos Locos.
By tomorrow night,
ain't nothing left, homes.
Hey, man, that Sonny Port\illo,
he's mine.
Man, that crab is gonna get wasted.
I'm taking you in, Guzman.
- What the hell for?
- For the shooting of Ernesto Lopez.
What? You ain't got nothing on me.
I got a positive ID on your car.
Hey, Walker, he don't
got those wheels no more, man.
- They got ripped off.
- Did he report\ it stolen?
Yeah, I report\ed it.
Cops love me so much,
they dropped their doughnuts
just to find it.
I was with him, man, all last night.
We all were.
Then who shot Lopez?
- I don't know who did that.
- That's not good enough, Paco.
Walker, man,
you're the one cop that I respect.
You've always been straight with us,
man. I'm being straight with you.
I don't know who did that.
Your turf was shot up last night.
You had to answer.
And we will answer.
We got a war coming on.
We got all these crabs moving in:
Port\illo, Vatos Locos.
But we gotta keep what's ours,
and we didn't start\ it.
And Guzman,
he did not shoot Ernesto.
- Okay, I'll believe you for now.
- Look, man, I wouldn't lie to you.
And I won't lie to you, Paco.
You start\ a war,
and I'll come down on you
like a hammer.
Hey, man,
we can't let Port\illo punk us out.
Guzman's right.
What are we supposed to do?
Nothing. I'll take care
of the Vatos Locos.
All right, all right.
- We'll stay on our turf.
- What?
But if they come here again,
there's gonna be a war.
Fair enough.
Hey, vato, this is a private club,
and we don't allow no visitors, esé.
You wanna piece of me too?
Hey.
- Who the hell are you?
- Your next nightmare, Sonny.
Walker, right?
I'm impressed, esé.
I must be somebody really import\ant,
que no?
- You got that right.
- I make exceptions for cockroaches.
I'm taking you in for extort\ion
and the attempted murder
of C.D. Parker.
The only thing you're missing, esé,
is the army it's gonna take
to pull that off.
I'm all the army
I'm gonna need, Sonny.
Come on.
Tell your veteranos
to make a path, Sonny,
or I'm gonna get real upset.
Clear the way, homeys.
They ain't got nothing on me.
I'll be out in two hours, locos.
Hey, Sonny, see you soon.
Hey, homes, call Rudy Figueroa.
Tell him to earn his keep.
Okay.
Got it, man.
I asked the bart\ender
for a donation to my youth club.
He took it wrong.
Threatened me with a shotgun.
You know,
I'm thinking of filing charges.
- You ran him down.
- No way, man.
I was kicking it with my homeys.
Ask any of them.
They rat, you cut their tongues out.
I've known you 10 years
and a day doesn't go by
I don't regret it.
We got you this time, vato.
Hey, Ochoa,
tell your sister I said hello.
Hey, hey, hey. Easy, Sal.
He's not wort\h it, man.
Walker, he made bail.
You're gonna have to cut him loose.
You booked me, now I'm booking.
I love this country.
You'll be back, Sonny.
Next time, you won't leave.
You come into my barrio again, esé,
maybe you don't leave.
There was a day you could
cut him off at the ankles for that.
I want his head, Trivette,
not his feet.
Mrs. Lopez, how's Ernesto doing?
There's no change.
Well, he's a strong boy.
He'll make it.
If it's God's will.
How's Tommy taking it?
I don't know about Tommy.
I have a son who's dying,
a son that I thought
had rose above all of it.
Ernesto has risen above it.
And now he's fighting for his life.
You don't understand,
Ranger Walker.
They never stop.
They're never out of it.
The machismo.
The blood for blood.
And the sisters
and the daughters and the mothers,
we can't do anything
but stand on the sidelines and weep.
I know it isn't easy, Mrs. Lopez.
You know,
we try and hold our families together.
We try and educate them,
and we try and keep them
out of gangs.
And we hope
and we pray every night
that when we come home,
they're still alive.
And then we bury them,
and life goes on,
until the next one dies.
- That won't happen to Tommy.
- It's too late.
I saw his eyes.
I know that look.
Look, he's in my class today.
I'll talk to him, okay?
Thank you.
Thank you, he respects you.
Thank you.
Manolo, wait for me.
Ernesto will be okay,
Tommy. Really.
Just shut up, Carlos, okay?
Hey, Tommy.
Hey, what's up, homey?
How you doing, man?
What's up, man?
Hey, how's your brother doing?
I tried to warn him, man.
I told you it was all coming down.
- How is he, man?
- Bad.
He should've stayed with us.
We could've protected him.
But now it's blood for blood.
You with us?
No. I don't know.
You want vengeance, don't you?
It's natural, loco.
You wanna get down for what's yours.
We can help you.
Yeah, but...
What, somebody told you not to?
We stand for our own, esé.
Who does that priest stand for?
And what's that Ranger telling you?
Do nothing?
Wuss out on your brother?
Even the Bible says
an eye for an eye, loco.
You need to bleed
the Diamonds, Tommy.
If you don't avenge your brother,
you're nobody.
- I know, man, but...
- You can join us, esé.
You can be Vatos Locos.
Are you down, esé?
Yeah, I'm down.
- Let's go, homey.
- Tommy, no.
What's up, homes? Yeah, let's go.
- Yeah.
- All you want is to get them, right?
- Whatever.
- Are you a real menace?
- Move back.
- Take it. Hey, take it.
Yeah.
- Get him.
- Let him have it.
Come on, come on.
All right.
Hey, hey, all right, all right, all right.
That's enough, that's enough.
What's up, dog? Little homey,
you're a good fighter, esé.
You got the fire.
Hey, let's welcome
our new homey to our clica.
- All right.
- Blood for blood, esé.
- All right.
- Vato Loco now.
- Where's Tommy, Carlos?
- He isn't here.
I know he isn't here.
Do you know where he is?
I think he's getting
jumped into the Vatos Locos.
Tommy.
- What happened?
- I fell down.
Right, and six or seven veteranos
fell right on top of you, right?
You know,
if you go in that direction,
you're gonna wind up in prison,
or worse.
I gotta stand up for what's mine.
For Ernesto.
- Port\illo says...
- Port\illo's a coward.
Your brother's a man.
It takes a man to stay out of the gang.
Ernesto has tubes in his nose.
He doesn't even know
he's peeing in a plastic bag.
If he was your brother,
what would you do?
It's not about me, Tommy.
It's about the rest of the your life.
And the decision you make now
is going to affect it forever.
But it is your choice.
I can't make it for you.
That's right, Ranger Walker.
You can't.
It's been great working for C.D.
You've done a great job
holding down the fort\.
Thanks, Alex.
- Hey.
- Hey. Anything from Forensics?
They're still sifting through all that
Ernesto Lopez crime-scene evidence.
Can't ID the slug
till they dig it out of him.
Which they can't do
until he wakes up.
How's it look?
His vital signs are improving,
but you know how that could go.
Jimmy, I thought Cordell
was coming with you.
He's poking around
on his own, C.D.
Oh, man.
Yeah, I guess he's taking this
mighty personal
because I was a victim
of those guys.
- What's the matter, Walker?
- I think I lost a kid today.
- The one you were worried about?
- Tommy Lopez.
Hey, guys,
I got a new Vatos Locos member
you might be interested in.
Here he is.
Yeah, they jumped him in
this morning.
- Sal, I want you to do me a favor.
- Sure, just name it.
I want you to hold onto that picture,
at least for a while.
He hasn't done anything wrong yet.
Okay, Walker,
but I think you're barking at the moon.
I hope not.
- Hey, Tommy, you scared?
- Yeah, a little.
I'm not. We're gonna toast them.
Hey, you haven't seen me, okay?
Hey, boys,
have you seen Tommy Lopez?
- Tommy who?
- You know who.
Hey, if you see him, tell him...
Mrs. Lopez.
Ernesto regained consciousness.
They're operating on him right now.
Dios, it's wonderful.
Do you know where Tommy is?
I've looked everywhere for him.
No, I'm sorry.
You should be there when
he gets out of surgery. I'll take you.
I can't, I have to work.
I've talked to your supervisor.
Everything's okay.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.
- Let's go.
Okay.
We'll cover for you.
By noon tomorrow,
I want their placa buried.
Yeah!
Yeah, I'm start\ing the war,
and it's on tonight at Belvedere Park.
All right.
Deep in the heart\
of the Diamonds' territory.
- Tonight?
- Yeah, tonight.
- What, you got a problem with that?
- It's Christmas Eve.
That's right, esé,
and by tomorrow morning, 20 blocks
of the barrio will have a new savior.
Yeah!
So, what's the word, mockingbird?
Are you ready to get down
for your own?
Are you ready to cap Guzman
for what he did to your brother?
It's all I've been waiting for, esé.
It's on dog. Let's roll.
Hey, Walker, you wanna come
take a look at this?
This is the bullet the doctors pulled
out of Ernesto Lopez this morning,
and that's one they pulled
out of the wounded Diamante
after his turf was shot up.
Both bullets are from the same gun.
Man, we've been looking
for two shooters and there's only one.
- What do you make of it?
- Sonny Port\illo did both shootings.
- Why?
- Start\ a gang war.
And to recruit Tommy Lopez.
Well, it's working so far.
How's Ernesto doing?
Oh, he's doing good.
They expect a full recovery.
- Did you tell Tommy?
- No, I can't find him anywhere.
Hey, guys.
- Thank God, there you are.
- What's shaking, Sal?
The whole damn planet, Jimmy.
Vatos Locos
smothered Diamante placa,
even in their own backyard.
- What's placa?
- Gang graffiti.
Graffiti to you. Jungle drums to me.
From the stockyards to city hall,
there isn't a wall
that doesn't have a Vatos Locos slap
in the Diamantes face.
To tell the truth, I don't know
what's holding the Diamantes back.
I think I do.
Paco made me a promise.
I bet that promise
is on thin ice, Walker.
It's gonna go down,
I don't know where or when,
but I can guarantee
it'll make the evening news.
- Where you going?
- Stop a war.
They jumped our fence.
- Now we're gonna bury them.
- Yeah!
I hate Vatos Locos,
worse than any of you,
but I gave my word.
You gave your word to the law, esé.
But it was my word.
Next time,
you give it to someone that counts.
You made me a promise, Paco.
Walker, there is only so much
we can take, man.
It's blood for blood,
and it's long past due.
Give me an hour,
then you can have your war.
No deal, man. If we don't show up
at Belvedere Park,
no Diamante
will ever get respect again.
- No, it's his way.
- That's right.
Either I lead the Diamantes,
or I end it all right here.
Now, what's it gonna be, homeys?
One hour, Ranger. You got one hour.
A minute more,
Vatos Locos blood
is gonna spill in the gutter.
- That's all I need.
- How are you gonna pull that off?
Sonny Port\illo wants a war,
he's got one.
Hey, locos.
The Diamantes aren't coming,
Port\illo,
so your war
is gonna have to be with me.
You? That's a joke.
You're under arrest.
Hey, esé, you can't book me
for the same thing twice.
This time it's for attempted murder.
You tried to kill Ernesto Lopez
and blame it on the Diamantes.
- Sonny?
- Cops are born liars, esé.
You can't prove it.
The gun in your hand will prove it.
Tommy, your brother
was operated on this morning.
He's gonna be okay.
Now, step away.
Stay where you are, man.
You want my bullets, Walker?
I'm gonna give you
the whole damn clip.
That part\ner of yours
has the heart\ of a lion.
Yeah, and the brain of a rock.
Come on, Sonny, cap the bastard.
This is bad, esé.
You gotta do something, carnal,
or nobody never gonna
follow you again, man.
Come on, Sonny, shoot.
Of course, killing a cop
will get you the electric chair.
All right, I'll make you a deal.
You and your veteranos take me on.
If you can beat me,
I'll let you go.
Let me get this straight.
You fight all of us.
If we win, you let us go?
That's the deal.
What the hell is Walker doing?
He's trying to save the young ones.
Let's take him down, homeys.
- Get your hands on him.
- Come on.
Hit him.
- Watch out, man.
- Gotta lay it out, man.
Drop it or use it, Sonny.
- You're a dead man, Walker.
- Watch out, man.
Cap him.
Do it. Francisco, Diego,
you're Vatos Locos, esé.
If you don't cap him now,
you'll never become veteranos.
Do it for the neighborhood.
Kill him now!
The choice you boys make right now
will affect the rest of your lives.
Be sure it's the right one.
Hey, come on, let's go.
All right. Hey.
All right, don't move.
Put your hands up.
- Weapons down.
- Down on the floor, please.
Weapons down.
Ranger Walker? Sonny's gun.
Wanna log it in?
Come on, Tommy.

These belts don't come easy.
You have to earn them.
You're all winners. Never forget that.

- Thank you, sir.
All right.
Yo, Tommy.
I'm so proud of you.
Ernesto, Mrs. Lopez.
Thank you so much for not giving up
on him, Ranger Walker.
He's a good kid. I was glad to help.
Me too. I almost blew it big time.
Yeah, but you didn't, Tommy.
That's all that matters.
Ranger Walker, would it be okay
if we joined your class?
- You know the rules.
- No drugs, no gangs.
Okay, Tommy,
go get them suited up.
Drugs and gangs, man,
that's the big problem.
How do we ever hope to solve it?
One kid at a time, Trivette.
One kid at a time.
