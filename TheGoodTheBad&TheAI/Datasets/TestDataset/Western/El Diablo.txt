SORRY.
MORNING,
SHERIFF EDWARDS.
GOOD MORNING,
BILLY RAY.
BET YOU AIN'T
NEVER SEEN A DAY
AS PRETTY AS THIS
BACK EAST IN...
BOSTON.
ACTUALLY, BOSTON CAN BE
QUITE BEAUTIFUL SHERIFF.
OH NETTIE!
I'M SORRY, MAMA.
BILLY RAY'S HERE.
I NEVER WOULD
HAVE KNOWN.
NETTIE, NO MORE
BILLY RAY.
IT'S MR. SMITH, OKAY?
OKAY.
MORNING, BILLY RAY.
NETTIE.
GOOD MORNING,
MRS. TULEEN.
NETTIE, YOU NEED
TO BE CAREFUL.
I'LL GET 'EM.
YOU HAVE TO TAKE
CARE OF THESE BOOKS.
DO YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT ME, BILLY RAY?
OF COURSE I DO.
I USUALLY WONDER IF
YOU'RE DOING YOUR
HOMEWORK RIGHT.
NO, I MEAN
DO YOU EVER THINK
OF ME AS A WOMAN?
SOMEDAY, YOU'RE GONNA BE
A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU DON'T?
LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING.
WHEN YOU'RE A LITTLE GIRL,
ALL YOU WANT IS TO BE A WOMAN.
WHEN YOU'RE A WOMAN,
YOU REALIZE
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS
TO BE A LITTLE GIRL.
IT'S DIFFERENT
FOR A MAN.
WHEN HE'S A BOY
HE NEEDS TO BEHAVE
AND MIND HIS FOLKS.
BUT WHEN
HE'S A MAN
HE HAS TO STAND TALL,
SPEAK THE TRUTH
MAKE AN HONEST
DAY'S LIVING
AND BE ABLE TO LOOK
ANY OTHER MAN
STRAIGHT IN THE EYE
WITHOUT FLINCHING.
GOOD MORNIN', BILLY RAY.
GOOD MORNING, CHARLIE.
BEAUTIFUL MORNIN'
FOR PROCREATION.
"BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY,"
SAYETH THE LORD.
BILLY RAY!
SEVEN MINUS
THREE EQUALS...
THINK ABOUT THIS
FOR A MINUTE, LON.
LET'S SAY YOU HAD
SEVEN CHICKENS
AND YOUR NEIGHBOR
CAME OVER
AND TOOK AWAY
THREE OF THEM.
HOW MANY WOULD
YOU HAVE LEFT?
WELL, I'D HAVE
SEVEN 'CAUSE
MY DADDY'D
SHOOT HIM
BEFORE HE GOT OUT
OF THE HENHOUSE.
I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH
ARITHMETIC FOR TODAY.
WHY DON'T YOU
SIT DOWN?
WE'RE STARTING
A NEW
BOOK TODAY.
THIS IS ONE OF MY
PERSONAL FAVORITES.
IS THERE A GIRL
IN THIS ONE, BILLY-
I MEAN,
MR. SMITH?
YES, THERE IS, NETTIE.
AAAWWWW!
THERE'S SOMETHING IN
HERE FOR EVERYONE.
WE COULD ALWAYS
GO BACK TO ARITHMETIC.
NO!
"THE LAYER OF DEW
THAT COVERED
"THE PRAIRIE
DISAPPEARED QUICKLY
"AS THE SUN ROSE
OVER THE FOOTHILLS.
"THE MOON HUNG
AROUND FOR A WHILE
"AND THEN SUNK
FAR BELOW THE RANGES.
"THE DAY BEGAN
"LIKE 1,000 OTHER
ARIZONA DAYS.
"THAT WAS
"UNTIL THE CLOUD CAME.
"IT BEGAN ON THE HORIZON.
"SHADOWS OF DUST
MOVING AT GREAT SPEED
"AS THE WHIRLWIND
GOT CLOSER,
"YOU COULD SEE
INTO THE DUST
"THE SHAPES OF HORSES
AND THEN THE RIDERS:
"AS THEY APPROACHED
THE TOWN
"AND YOU COULD
SEE THEIR FACES.
"FACES WEATHERED
BY THE MEXICAN SUN.
"FACES MARKED
BY VIOLENCE.
"THEY INSTINCTIVELY
WITHDREW INTO
"THE SHADOWS OF
THE BOARDWALK.
"MANY OF THE MERCHANTS
WENT INSIDE
"THEIR SHOPS AND
LOCKED THEIR DOORS.
"SHADES CAME DOWN.
"'CLOSED' SIGNS APPEARED
AS THE TOWN
"PREPARED TO LOOK
THE OTHER WAY."
"AND IT WASN'T
TO MAKE A DEPOSIT.
"AND KILLERS WITH NO
REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE.
"IT WAS AS IF
THEY WERE PUT
"ON THIS EARTH
BY THE DEVIL
"TO TORMENT DECENT
GOD FEARING FOLKS
"WHO WORKED HARD TO
MAKE AN HONEST LIVING."
JUST LIKE IN THE
STORY,  BILLY RAY!
THEY GOT GUNS!
THEY'RE COMIN' THIS WAY.
PUT AWAY EVERYTHING.
STAY IN YOUR SEATS!
COME BACK!
COME ON, GIRLS.
STAY IN HERE!
NETTIE, MOVE!
MOVE!
IT'S REAL, NETTIE!
LET ME GO!
PLEASE PUT HER DOWN!
BILLY!
SEQOR, NO,
SEQOR. NO!
NO!
GRINGO!
WAIT!
GRINGO!
BILLY!
WHO IN THE HELL WAS THAT?
THEY SHOT HAROLD
AND MR. WEBB!
WHERE THE HELL'S THE SHERIFF?
SLEEPIN' PROBABLY.
SOMEBODY GO WAKE HIM UP!
TELL HIM TO ROUND UP A POSSE!
THE BANK!
THEY TOOK THE TULEEN GIRL.
OH, MY GOD!
MOUNT UP!
BILLY RAY?
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU'RE LOOKIN'
KINDA PEAKED.
SOMEBODY BETTER
GO GET THE DOC.
THEY HAVE MY NETTIE!
IS MY DAUGHTER THERE?
CAN ANYONE SEE
MY NETTIE THERE?
BILLY RAY,
CAN YOU SEE?
MY EYES AREN'T WHAT
THEY USED TO BE.
LOOK AT THAT.
LOOKS LIKE ONE RIDER, HUH?
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANYBODY ON THEM HORSES.
I SEE THE SHERIFF.
I SWEAR THAT'S HIM.
WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?
SHERIFF, YOU
DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.
SOMEBODY GET THE DOC.
THAT'S JETHRO'S HORSE!
WHERE IS JETHRO?
THERE'S BLOOD
ON THE SADDLE.
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED, SHERIFF?
LORDY, THEY'VE CUT
OUT HIS TONGUE.
EXCUSE ME, DEPUTY.
DID YOU SAY THAT THEY
CUT OUT HIS TONGUE?
HERE IT IS, RIGHT HERE.
EVEN IF WE COULD
GET A POSSE TOGETHER,
WE WOULDN'T KNOW
WHERE TO FIND 'EM.
U.S. GOVERNMENT
AND THE FEDERALES
BEEN SEARCHIN'
FOR HIM FOR YEARS.
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHIN'
ABOUT THIS "  ."
THEY DID FIND HIM ONCE.
CAUGHT HIM
DOWN IN AMOS,
THAT LITTLE BORDER TOWN
NORTH OF LAREDO.
CAUGHT HIM,
TRIED HIM
AND HANGED HIM,
ALL IN THE SAME NIGHT.
BUT HE WOULDN'T DIE.
HE JUST HANGED THERE
BY HIS NECK, SPITTIN'
AT THE CROWD LIKE
THEY DISGUSTED HIM.
CUSSED 'EM OUT SO BAD,
THE WOMENFOLK
HAD TO GO HOME.
I WAS THERE WHEN
THEY CUT HIM DOWN.
I THANK THE LORD
I LEFT WHEN I DID.
IT WAS THREE DAYS LATER,
SO THE STORY GOES
EL DIABLO RETURNED
TO AMOS WITH HIS MEN
AND CUT OUT THE
HEART OF EVERY MAN,
WOMAN AND CHILD
IN THE WHOLE TOWN
AND JUST LEFT THEM THERE
TO BLEACH IN THE SUN.
SOON, THEY STARTED TO ROT
AND THEN THE
BUZZARDS COME
AND STARTED PECKIN'
AT THEIR EYES.
SPIVEY, THAT'S
ENOUGH OF THAT.
DEVIL DON'T
NEVER DIE!
NO, SIR.
SO NO ONE'S
GONNA DO ANYTHING
ABOUT GETTING
MY NETTIE BACK.
PROBABLY CUT OUT
HER HEART AND EATEN IT.
OH, MY GOD.
I DIDN'T SAY NOTHIN'
ABOUT EATING THEIR HEARTS
HE JUST CUT
'EM OUT AND LEFT.
SPIVEY!
I'M SORRY, DEPUTY.
OR ARE YOU THE
SHERIFF NOW?
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE,
IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
TO GO AFTER EL DIABLO.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO ABOUT IT, SHERIFF?
AT LAST REPORT,
THE DOC SAYS
THE SHERIFF'S FEELIN'
MUCH BETTER.
AND I SUPPOSE
HE'S BEEN WORKIN'
ON HIS SIGN
LANGUAGE, TOO?
SPIVEY'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE THE NEW SHERIFF.
WE PAY YOUR WAGE.
YEAH. RIGHT.
I INTEND TO BRING
NETTIE BACK.
I SAID, I INTEND TO
BRING BACK NETTIE.
YOU AND WHO ELSE,
SCHOOLTEACHER?
ME AND KID DURANGO,
THAT'S WHO.
I MEAN,
KID DURANGO AND I.
CHARLIE, YOU
GOT COMPETITION.
CAN'T EVEN SHOOT A GUN.
I INTEND TO LEARN
TO SHOOT A GUN.
EL DIABLO'S GONNA DROP
A LOAD OF MANURE IN
HIS PANTS WHEN HE SEES
YOU COMIN' AT HIM.
I DO KNOW ONE MAN
MY SECOND COUSIN
MAGGIE SUE'S BROTHER-IN-LAW
J.D. SHOANS.
HE'S SOME KIND
OF LAWMAN NOW,
TEXAS RANGER.
HE'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE
RODE WITH KID DURANGO.
TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
WE NEVER HAD ALL THAT
MUCH TO DO WITH HIM.
SORT OF THE DISGRACE
OF THE FAMILY,
YOU KNOW?
HE SHOT AND KILLED
MY COUSIN DEKE
ABOUT EIGHT YEARS
AGO UP IN SONOMA.
HE ALSO SHOT
AND KILLED
MY DADDY'S
BROTHER EDWARD.
WHERE'S HE NOW?
THE LAST TIME I HEARD,
HE WAS UP IN MILLENNIUM.
SOME KIND OF MARSHAL
OR RANGER UP THERE.
HELL, AIN'T BUT A
TURD'S DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN J.D. AND
THE SCUM HE HAULS IN.
BUT IF ANYBODY
COULD HELP YOU
FIND KID DURANGO,
IT'D BE HIM.
YOU NEED BIGGER BOTTLES.
YOU BE DARN CAREFUL
WHO YOU SHOW THAT TO.
YES, SIR.
SHERIFF EDWARDS
WROTE YOU THIS NOTE.
"DON'T GO."
THANK HIM FOR
THE ADVICE.
YOU'RE A DARN
FOOL, BILLY RAY.
YES, SIR,
I KNOW.
COME ON, ROJO.
ONLY GOD CAN KILL
THE DEVIL, BILLY RAY.
FORWARD.
BILLY RAY DONE SHOT HIS HORSE!
EXCUSE ME.
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHERE I CAN FIND
A MR. J.D. SHOANS?
WHAT DO YOU WANT
WITH HIM, SONNY?
I JUST HAVE A VERY
IMPORTANT QUESTION
I'D LIKE TO ASK HIM.
YOU SHOULD'VE
ASKED HIM YESTERDAY.
ALL ABOARD!
WE ARE NOW COMMITTING
THIS MAN, MR. JONES
MR. SHOANS
TO HIS LIFE IN
THE HEREAFTER.
LET'S TAKE A MOMENT
TO ACKNOWLEDGE
HIS CONTRIBUTIONS
TO OUR COMMUNITY.
DURING HIS SHORT-LIVED
TERM AS SHERIFF,
HE SERVED THE PUBLIC TO
THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY.
HE SHOT EIGHT MEN
AND THREE WOMEN
MOST OF WHOM ENGAGED IN
BREAKING THE LAW.
I'M SURE THE OTHERS
WERE HONEST MISTAKES.
WHAT HAPPENED?
A FRIEND OF YOURS?
SORT OF.
YEAH.
SAME HERE.
SORT OF.
YOU GOT BUSINESS
WITH J.D.?
YEAH.
I'M THE SHERIFF NOW.
MAYBE I CAN BE OF
SOME ASSISTANCE.
THROW THE DIRT ON HIM
AND LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.
ARE YOU RELATED TO HIM?
NO, SIR.
I WANNA THANK YOU
FOR DISTRACTIN' THEM FOLK.
WHAT YOU LOOKIN' AT?
YOU JUST SHOT
HIM IN THE BACK.
HIS BACK WAS TO ME.
COME ON, BOY, HELP
ME OUTTA THIS HOLE.
COME ON,
HELP ME UP.
BESIDES, HE SHOT
J.D. IN THE BACK.
JUST SEEMED RIGHT.
HE KILLED J.D.?
YEAH.
SAID HE WANTED TO
BE SHERIFF REAL BAD.
NOW HE'S SHERIFF
REAL BAD.
REO HERE DON'T LIKE
GUNFIRE. HURTS HIS EARS.
MAYBE YOU CAN
TELL ME WHERE
I CAN FIND A MAN
NAMED KID DURANGO?
WHAT DO YOU
WANT HIM FOR?
THEY SAY HE'S THE
FASTEST GUN IN THE WEST.
OH, YEAH?
I WANNA HIRE
HIM FOR A JOB.
YOU GOT ANY MONEY?
MAYBE.
HIRE ME.
I AIN'T AS FAST AS
I USED TO BE,
BUT, I CHEAT
REAL GOOD.
FAST DON'T MEAN A
WHOLE LOT THESE DAYS.
US PROFESSIONAL
FOLKS ARE TIRED
OF FIGHTIN' FAIR
AND DYIN' FOR IT.
YOU KNOW
KID DURANGO?
YEAH, I KNOW HIM.
COULD YOU TAKE
ME TO HIM?
WHERE ARE YOU
FROM, BOY?
ORIGINALLY BOSTON,
MASSACHUSETTS.
I FIGURED.
I'M GETTIN' OLD, REO.
MAYBE YOU
COULD HELP ME.
JUST POINT ME IN THE
RIGHT DIRECTION, MR?
VAN LEEK.
THOMAS VAN LEEK.
I COULD STAY HERE
AND DRAW YOU A MAP.
BUT I'D BETTER
MOVE BEFORE
THEY START ASKIN'
QUESTIONS ABOUT
HOW THE SHERIFF
LEFT OFFICE.
FIGURE ME AND REO
GONNA HEAD FOR MEXICO.
MEXICO? YOU
KNOW, THE MAN
I WISH TO APPREHEND
IS IN MEXICO.
MOUNT UP.
I WOULDN'T MIND
HAVIN' YOU TAG
ALONG FOR A WHILE.
I DON'T HAVE
A HORSE.
I'M SORRY, REO.
IF YOU'D BE SO KIND
AS TO LEAVE THAT
SADDLE WHERE IT IS,
WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY.
YES, SIR.
JUST A MINUTE.
.
.
HOW MUCH WAS YOU
FIXIN' TO PAY THIS
KID DURANGO FOR
THIS JOB YOU NEEDED?
WHATEVER THE
GOING RATE,
THE FAIR RATE,
HAPPENS TO BE.
YOU NEVER DID SAY
WHAT IT WAS YOU
NEEDED TO BE DONE.
HARD TO COME UP
WITH A PRICE
IF YOU DON'T
KNOW THAT.
I WANT TO RESCUE A
YOUNG GIRL WHO WAS
KIDNAPPED BY A MAN
NAMED EL DIABLO.
AND I WANT TO
BRING HIM
AND HIS COMPATRIOTS
TO JUSTICE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU CAN'T RIDE.
YOU CAN'T SHOOT.
YOU CAN'T
EVEN THINK, BOY.
YOU'RE IN THE
WRONG TERRITORY.
GODDAMN FOOL!
COME ON, REO.
WHOA.
DON'T LET HIM GET AWAY!
I GOT HIM.
WHERE'D HE GO?
THAT WAY.
OVER THERE.
HE'S IN THE GULLY!
I DON'T SEE NO GULLY.
IT'S RIGHT IN
FRONT OF YOU!
SORRY.
THIS WAY, YOU JACKASS.
LET'S GO.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
HOW COULD HE GET AWAY?
THERE HE IS.
WE GOT HIM NOW,
BOYS. SPLIT UP!
I TOLD YOU THE GULLY.
LET ME HAVE
THE FIRST SHOT!
LOOK, HE'S GOIN'
IN THE SHITTER.
AWFUL BIG ONE.
THAT'S ONE OF THEM
THREE-HOLERS.
I SAW IT IN
THE CATALOGUE.
YOU CAN'T READ.
COME ON,
LET'S GET HIM.
WAIT TILL HE GETS OUT.
HELL, HE MIGHT BE
IN THERE A WEEK.
YOU THINK WE GOT HIM?
YEAH, BUT GO ON
OVER AND MAKE SURE.
YOU GO.
YOU'RE CLOSER.
THE HELL I AM.
DICK'S CLOSEST.
I WENT FIRST LAST WEEK.
HORSESHIT. I WENT FIRST AND
GOT SHOT, REMEMBER?
SHUT UP!
BUT IT WAS ONLY
IN THE HEAD.
IT STILL HURT AND IT
AFFECTED MY BALANCE.
I SAID SHUT UP!
AFTERNOON.
JESUS H. CHRIST, VAN LEEK,
DON'T SNEAK UP LIKE THAT.
I WASN'T SNEAKIN'.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
JUST PASSIN' THROUGH.
GOT SOMEBODY
HOLED UP IN THERE?
WE DO. SNARED
UP LIKE A RABBIT.
THE BOY THAT SHOT
THE SHERIFF?
YEAH.
DOES IT HAVE
A REWARD?
NO, WE'RE
JUST UP HERE
BECAUSE WE WANNA
SEE JUSTICE DONE.
HOW MUCH?
$400--
$200.
DEAD OR ALIVE.
THAT SEEMS LIKE
ENOUGH TO GO AROUND.
I AIN'T SPLITTIN' IT
MORE THAN FIVE WAYS.
I WAS HOPIN' THAT
KID WOULD GET LUCKY
AND SHOOT A
COUPLE OF US.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
BACK OFF, VAN LEEK?
GOOD LUCK.
THIS WON'T TAKE
BUT A MINUTE, REO.
DID YOU GUYS HEAR THAT?
IS THAT A HORSE?
SURE AIN'T NO ARMADILLO.
I HEAR IT,
BUT I DON'T SEE NOTHIN'.
JAKE'S DOWN.
JAKE'S DOWN.
JESUS!
WHO IS THAT?
LET'S GO.
SOMEBODY KILL
THAT SON OF A BITCH!
THAT KID'S SOMETHIN' ELSE.
NICE SHOT, KID.
THANK YOU.
THERE'S YOUR NEW
HORSE UP THERE.
MR. VAN LEEK?
I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU
UP ON YOUR OFFER
TO HELP ME GET EL DIABLO.
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
COME ON, REO.
THAT WAS AN
IMPRESSIVE DISPLAY
OF GUNMANSHIP TODAY.
GUNMANSHIP?
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU'D CONSIDER
TEACHING ME A FEW
TRICKS OF THE TRADE.
THEY AIN'T
TRICKS, BOY.
THEY'RE MEANS
OF DEATH.
HERE.
DON'T POINT THAT
THING AT ME, BOY.
I AIN'T NO HORSE.
SORRY.
PICK A STAR.
WHAT?
LAY DOWN ON
YOUR BACK.
WHAT FOR?
SHUT YOUR
GODDAMN HOLE, BOY,
AND LAY DOWN
ON YOUR BACK.
PICK A STAR.
GOT ONE.
THAT'S ENIF.
ENIF?
THE STAR YOU'RE
FIXIN' ON.
IT'S THE BRIGHTEST
STAR IN PEGASUS
THE CONSTELLATION
OF THE WINGED HORSE.
RIGHT THERE.
DON'T DROP
YOUR LOOK, BOY.
YOU GOTTA
CONCENTRATE.
KEEP YOUR EYE FIXED
ON THAT TARGET,
REAL STEADY.
I GOT IT.
GOOD.
KEEP IT THERE
TILL I TELL
YOU TO STOP.
YES, SIR.
GOOD.
DROP YOUR EYES
FROM THAT TARGET,
YOU'RE A DEAD MAN.
PATIENCE
CONCENTRATION
THE FIRST TWO THINGS
YOU GOTTA LEARN.
GOT IT.
YOU BETTER START
PRAYIN' THAT WASN'T REO.
BEBE?
YOU MISSED.
HE MISSED?
I GUESS THE BALANCE
AIN'T QUITE RIGHT.
WHERE THE HELL
DID YOU GET THAT?
RIGHT OFF THE SON
OF A BITCH'S BOOT.
YOU GOT IT.
THIS BOY
HERE GOT IT.
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
THEY STOLE HIS GIRL.
ACTUALLY, SHE WAS
ONE OF MY STUDENTS.
PRETTIEST ONE IN
THE  CLASS, I'LL BET.
I MAKE IT A POLICY
NOT TO GET INVOLVED
WITH MY STUDENTS.
THINK THIS'LL
GET US IN?
COULD BE.
OL' EL DIABLO DOES
FAVOR HIS SPURS.
GETTING IN'S
THE EASY PART.
IF YOU DON'T TAKE THE
WHOLE DAMN THING
IN WITH YOU
YOU JUST MIGHT GET BACK
OUT AGAIN IN ONE PIECE.
WHAT THE HELL YOU
LOOKIN' AT, BOY?
NOTHIN'.
DAMN RIGHT! THERE
AIN'T NOTHIN' THERE.
* SHALL WE GATHER
AT THE RIVER *
* WHERE BRIGHT ANGEL'S
FEET HAVE TROD *
* WITH ITS CRYSTAL
TIDE FOREVER *
* FLOWING FROM THE
THRONE OF GOD *
* YES, WE'LL GATHER
AT THE RIVER *
* THE BEAUTIFUL,
THE BEAUTIFUL RIVER *
* GATHER WITH THE
SAINTS AT THE RIVER *
* THAT FLOWS FROM
THE THRONE OF GOD. *
HEAR THE WORD
OF THE LORD,
O PEOPLE OF...
BENDIX.
BENDIX ROCK,
FOR THE LORD
HAS A CONTROVERSY WITH
THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND.
THERE IS NO FAITHFULNESS
OF GOD IN THE LAND.
THERE IS SWEARING.
AMEN.
AND LYING.
KILLING. STEALING.
AND COMMITTING ADULTERY.
AMEN.
AMEN!
NOTHING ESCAPES
THE POWER
AND THE VISION
OF THE LORD.
THOSE WHO HAVE SINNED
WILL BE PUNISHED!
PRAISE THE LORD.
BUT WE ARE HERE,
ALSO, TO FORGIVE
TO ASK THE LORD FOR MERCY
SO THAT THE SOULS
OF JONATHAN NAPIER
AND BOB ZAMUDIO.
ROBERTO.
SO THAT THEIR SOULS
CAN BE SAVED.
IF YOU DO NOT TAKE
THE LORD SERIOUSLY
THEN HE WILL NOT
TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY.
NOT ONLY WILL THE SOULS
OF THESE POOR UNFORTUNATES
BE EXILED FOR
ETERNITY IN HELL
BUT SO WILL
YOURS AS WELL!
YOU MUST SHARE
WITH THE LORD
THE FRUITS OF
YOUR LABORS.
ONLY THEN CAN HE TRULY
BECOME YOUR SAVIOR.
HANG 'EM. GET ON WITH IT!
NOW I WANNA SEE
THIS COLLECTION PLATE
PASSED AROUND ONCE AGAIN.
THIS TIME I WANNA
SEE IT OVERFLOW
WITH EVIDENCE OF YOUR
LOVE FOR THE LORD!
AND I ADD THAT
IF I'M DISAPPOINTED,
THERE WON'T BE ANY SHOW
OF JUSTICE METED
OUT TODAY.
BUT RATHER, THESE MEN
WILL BE RELEASED
BACK INTO YOUR
FOLD TO CONTINUE
ROBBING AND KILLING
AND HAVING THEIR WAY WITH
YOUR WIVES AND DAUGHTERS
WITH THE SHEEP AND GOATS
AND TURKEYS OF
YOUR FLOCKS!
TURKEYS?
MAY GOD BLESS YOU!
BLESS YOU!
BLESS YOU.
YOU RECOGNIZE 'EM?
ONE OF 'EM'S
BOB ZAMUDIO.
HE'S A PRETTY GOOD
HAND WITH EXPLOSIVES.
THAT ONE DANGLIN',
I DON'T KNOW.
WE COULD USE
SOME HELP.
AFTERNOON PREACHER.
LET US ALL JOIN IN
AND SING THE HYMN,
WHILST THE GOOD LORD
DETERMINES THE FATE OF OUR
BRETHREN HERE.
* WHAT A FRIEND
WE HAVE IN JESUS *
* ALL OUR SINS AND
PRAISE TO BEAR *
* WHAT A FRIEND WE HAVE... *
EQUAL SHARES
ALL AROUND.
WE'RE GONNA NEED
YOUR DEAD MEN NOW.
I THINK THAT CAN
BE ARRANGED.
.
WHO IN THE
HELL IS THIS
SNOT-NOSED
LITTLE PANTYWAIST?
HE'S WITH ME.
HELL, HE'S THE ONE
THAT STOLE THIS!
IS THIS ALL WE
GOT TO GO ON?
HIS SPURS ARE LIKE HIS
FINGERS, LIKE HIS TOES.
THEY'RE PART
OF HIS BODY.
HELL, THAT WAS
HIS DADDY'S SPURS,
AND HIS DADDY'S
DADDY'S!
"HIS DADDY'S SPURS,
AND HIS DADDY'S DADDY'S."
WHAT A SORRY BUNCH
OF WASHED-UP HAS-BEENS.
IS   .
THOSE RED THINGS
ARE REAL RUBIES, BOB.
ROBERTO.
EL DIABLO'S
TREASURE:
INDIAN GOLD
EUROPEAN GOLD
JUST WAITIN' THERE
FOR US TO TAKE IT.
HE'S RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
I SEEN IT WITH
MY OWN EYES.
EL DIABLO HAS
SOMETHING WORTH
A LITTLE MORE THAN
GOLD DOWN THERE.
THERE'S A LITTLE GIRL--
FUCK YOUR LITTLE GIRL.
JUST A SECOND.
YOU DON'T
WANNA DO THAT.
YES, HE DOES.
YES, HE DOES.
COME ON, BOY.
COME ON!
COME ON.
COME AND
GET IT, BOY.
WE'RE GOING TO
NEED DYNAMITE
AND SOMEONE
TO HANDLE IT.
HOW ABOUT
IT, BOBBY?
I THINK I TOLD YOU
ONCE OR TWICE
I DO NOT ANSWER TO
THAT GRINGO NAME!
LOOK,    ROBERTO
WE VERY MUCH
APPRECIATE
YOU HELPING US WITH
YOUR SPECIAL TALENTS.
DYNAMITE IS
LIKE A WOMAN.
IT TAKES THE
RIGHT HOMBRE
TO KNOW HOW TO
MAKE HER EXPLODE!
THERE'S SOMEBODY
OUT THERE.
I DON'T HEAR
NOTHIN'.
INJUNS.
INJUNS? AIN'T NO DAMN
INJUNS AROUND HERE.
WE'RE IN MEXICO,
ASSHOLE!
THE PONCHACHAUN'S,
ASSHOLE!
I LIVED WITH
'EM FOR A YEAR.
DON'T NEVER
ROB NO INDIAN.
I ROB AN INDIAN,
SAME AS ANYBODY.
YEAH, DID YOU SLEEP
WITH HIS WIFE, TOO?
WHAT WAS IT LIKE SLEEPIN'
WITH AN INDIAN WOMAN?
BETTER THAN A NIGGER.
THANK YOU, BOY.
NOW, GENERALLY, I LET
A MAN OFF FIRST TIME
HE SAY THAT
TO ME.
THAT IS, IF HE
SAYS HE'S SORRY.
HOW ABOUT YOU,
MR. NAPIER?
ARE YOU SORRY?
I DON'T HEAR YOU,
MR. NAPIER.
I'M...
I'M WAITIN'.
BYE, NIGGER!
SOMEONE OUGHT TO
TRY TO TALK TO HIM.
GO ON, BOB,
YOU SPEAKUM SIGN.
ROBERTO.
I DON'T THINK
CHIEF UNDERSTANDS.
YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT, BROWN MAN.
AND NAME NOT CHIEF.
NAME DANCING BEAR.
I NEVER LIKED HIM!
WHAT?
GET OUT OF THE HOLE.
THIS LITTLE
CACHE HERE
HAS ENABLED
ROBERTO AND ME
TO OPEN ACCOUNTS
AT OVER
IN THE SOUTHWEST.
YOU CAN GET ME
OUT OF HERE NOW.
NOT FAST.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
IT'S DECAYIN',
I THINK.
I TOLD YOU WE SHOULDN'T
BURY IT HERE, BOB.
NO SHADE,
TOO HOT, BOB.
I DON'T THINK NOW'S THE
TIME TO MAKE ME ANGRY.
AIE, AIE, AIE, AIE,
I AM ROBERTO.
COME ON, COME ON.
IT'S NOT FUNNY.
IS GOOD, HUH?
WE'RE A BIT FAR APART.
MAYBE THAT MIGHT NOT BE
GOOD FOR THEIR MORALE?
FEEL FREE TO
JOIN 'EM, BOY.
I'M SURE THEY'D
WELCOME THE COMPANY.
WHAT DO YOU
WANT, BOY?
LEMON, WHATEVER
HE'S HAVING.
THOMAS, IS THAT YOU?
BARTENDER, PUT THEIR
DRINKS ON MY BILL.
THOMAS, YOU DEVIL,
PLEASE COME HERE,
JOIN ME.
THOMAS VAN LEEK,
AS I LIVE AND BREATHE?
SO NICE TO SEE YOU.
HELLO.
HELLO.
AREN'T YOU GOING TO INTRODUCE
ME TO YOUR FRIEND?
THIS HERE IS
BILLY RAY SMITH.
BOY, THIS HERE IS
TRUMAN FEATHERS
SOMETIMES KNOWN
AS KID DURANGO.
KID DURANGO?
UH-HUH.
KID DURANGO.
KID DURANGO?
UH-HUH.
THIS BOY HAS READ EVERY
ONE OF YOUR BOOKS.
REALLY?
KID DURANGO?
WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO THIS HOLE?
I'M RESEARCHING
OUR NEXT ADVENTURE.
SMOKE SIGNALS
INDICATED THAT
YOU WERE HEADED
IN THIS DIRECTION.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A
HAT JUST LIKE THAT.
I LOVE YOUR OUTFIT.
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
ORIGINALLY BOSTON,
MASSACHUSETTS.
REALLY?  I'VE BEEN
TO RHODE ISLAND.
WHAT DID HE MEAN
WHEN HE SAID,
"OUR NEXT ADVENTURE?"
IT'S A WONDERFUL
ARRANGEMENT.
THOMAS RUNS AROUND THE WEST,
RISKING HIS SILLY NECK
AND I INCORPORATE HIS EXPLOITS
INTO MY LITTLE TRUE STORIES.
YOU MEAN--
WHAT HE MEANS IS,
AIN'T NOBODY GONNA BUY
NO STORIES ABOUT
NO NEGRO COWBOYS.
IT'S DRAMATIC
LICENSE, REALLY.
IT'S A NECESSARY EVIL
IN THE LITERARY WORLD.
DRAMATIC LICENSE, HELL!
WHOLE BUNCH OF LIES.
YOU MADE ALL THAT MONEY
AND I NEVER DID SEE SQUAT.
WHAT REALLY GETS
ME IS ALL THAT CRAP
ABOUT "LOOKIN' A
MAN IN THE EYE."
HELL, A MAN DON'T GO FOR
A GUN WITH HIS EYE.
LOOK AT HIS HAND.
I'LL MAKE A
NOTE OF IT.
THEY WERE WITH
EL DIABLO IN THE BANK.
THE UNATTRACTIVE
ONE IS PESTOSO.
THAT OTHER ONE
AIN'T NO LADY-KILLER.
YES, THAT'S
CHAK MOL.
DO YOU KNOW THEM?
THEY COME HERE
TO UNWIND AFTER
THEIR FORAYS OF
RAPING AND PILLAGING.
I'VE INTERVIEWED
BOTH OF THEM.
PESTOSO IS
SURPRISINGLY VOCAL.
HEY, BOY.
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT BEING
THE FASTEST GUN
IN THE WEST?
HUH?
SO, YOU'RE THE FASTEST
GUN IN THE WEST?
DO YOU KNOW TO
WHOM THIS BELONGS?
WHERE YOU
GET THAT?
CAN YOU TAKE
ME TO HIM?
TAKE YOU TO WHO?
"TAKE YOU TO WHOM."
EL DIABLO.
EL DIABLO?
WHERE YOU GOIN',
GRINGO?
GOOD SHOT, BOY.
GOOD SHOT.
YOU?
I'LL MEET YOU
IN THE MORNING
JUST OUTSIDE
OF TOWN
THE TREE OF DEATH.
COME ALONE.
TREE OF DEATH?
OUCH!
NEVER TRUST A MAN WHO
TALKS TO HIS SNAKE.
IT'S TRUMAN.
MORNING.
WHAT THE HELL YOU
DOIN', FEATHERS?
WELL,
I'VE DECIDED TO JOIN
YOUR EXPEDITION.
NOT WITH ME,
YOU AIN'T.
YOU WON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT ME.
I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT US,
WITH YOU OUT THERE.
OH, THOMAS, PLEASE.
I'M SURE I CAN PERFORM
SOME VERY USEFUL
FUNCTIONS ON THE TRAIL.
AND BESIDES, I'M
AN EXCELLENT COOK.
CAN YOU MAKE COFFEE?
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I BROUGHT SOME FRESH
COLUMBIAN BEANS.
AND, BY THE WAY, I MAKE
A WONDERFUL OMELET.
WHAT IS "OMELET?"
AN OMELET IS DICED HAM,
CHEESE, PEPPERS
FOLDED INTO THREE
EGGS, COOKED
IN AN IRON SKILLET,
SLIGHTLY WARMED.
MUSHROOMS, SNAKE MEAT,
SQUASH? GOOD?
GOOD? I WOULDN'T
RECOMMEND THE SQUASH BUT
IT'S ENTIRELY
UP TO YOU.
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE,
LET'S MOVE OUT!
COME ON.
FORWARD!
.
NOW, I STILL
DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE COMIN'
ALONG WITH US.
ACTUALLY, IT'S YOUR
EXAMPLE, BILLY RAY.
I'VE ALWAYS WRITTEN
ABOUT OTHER
PEOPLE'S EXPLOITS.
I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT
BEFORE I PASS ON
I COULD INCLUDE A FEW
ADVENTURES OF MY VERY OWN.
THAT WAS A WONDERFUL
MOMENT YESTERDAY
IN THE STREETS WITH
YOU AND PESTOSO.
IT WAS THRILLING,
VIRTUALLY WRITES ITSELF.
YOU'RE GONNA PUT ME
IN ONE OF YOUR BOOKS?
OF COURSE. EVERY
STORY NEEDS ITS HERO.
HEY, BOY, LEMME
SEE THAT SPUR.
YES, SIR.
YOU HOLD ONTO
THAT HALF, BOY.
THAT'S YOUR
CALLING CARD.
GO AHEAD ON.
BE RIGHT BEHIND
YOU. GO ON.
GOOD LUCK,
BILLY RAY.
THANK YOU.
GOODBYE.
EXCUSE ME, COULD
YOU TELL ME PRECISELY
WHY THEY CALL THIS
THE TREE OF DEATH?
EXCUSE ME.
.
THANK YOU.
SORRY.
THEY'RE TOO SPLIT UP FOR
US TO GET ALL AT ONCE.
I THINK THERE
MIGHT JUST BE
A SOLUTION TO THIS
PROBLEM FORTHCOMING.
WE SPLIT UP HERE.
THAT LEFT TUNNEL WILL LET YOU
OUT ABOVE THE VILLAGE.
WAIT FOR MY SIGNAL.
GOOD ENOUGH?
I THINK A LITTLE
PRAYER IS IN ORDER
BEFORE WE EMBARK ON
THIS PERILOUS ORDEAL.
IF YOU WILL ALL JOIN ME IN
RECITING THE LORD'S PRAYER.
"OUR FATHER--
"OUR FATHER,
WHO ART IN HEAVEN
"HALLOWED BE THY NAME.
"THY KINGDOM COME.
THY WILL BE DONE ON EARTH"
THIS IS SORRY WORK
PARTY, BROWN MAN.
I DID THE BEST I
COULD, RED MAN.
I'M HERE TO FREE MY PEOPLE.
DON'T YOU GET IN MY WAY.
WOULDN'T THINK OF IT.
THOMAS?
I'D LIKE TO HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU.
IF IT'S SHORT.
I FIND YOUR BEHAVIOR IN THIS
ENDEAVOR QUESTIONABLE.
IT'S PERFECTLY OBVIOUS TO
ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
YOU'RE USING THIS
BOY AS A DIVERSION
SO THAT YOU CAN STEAL AS
MUCH GOLD AS YOU CAN CARRY.
ONLY DANCING BEAR IS MOTIVATED
BY HONORABLE INTENTIONS.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH
OF MERCENARIES.
YOU FINISHED?
YES.
I HAD TO GET IT
OFF MY CHEST.
HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER.
COME ON, REO.
EL DIABLO WON'T TOUCH
THE KID WITHOUT HIS SPUR.
.
YOU ARE THE BOY WHO
KILLED PESTOSO?
WHAT IS YOUR NAME,
LITTLE BOY?
WILLIAM RAYMOND SMITH.
MR. DEVIL, IS IT?
I UNDERSTAND,
MR. WILLIAM RAYMOND SMITH
YOU HAVE BROUGHT
SOMETHING FOR ME.
YES, SIR.
THIS IS MY SPUR,
I BELIEVE?
THAT IS CORRECT.
THERE IS
SOMETHING MISSING.
THAT IS ALSO CORRECT.
WHERE IS THE
MISSING PIECE?
THAT'S FOR ME TO KNOW
AND YOU TO FIND OUT.
I WANT TO EXCHANGE IT,
THE MISSING PIECE THAT
IS, FOR THE GIRL.
WHAT GIRL IS THAT?
MISS NETTIE TULEEN.
YOU KIDNAPPED
HER IN FRONT
OF MY SCHOOL ABOUT
FIVE WEEKS AGO?
SO MANY TOWNS,
SO MANY GIRLS.
SHE'S ABOUT 5-FOOT-4
BLONDE HAIR,
BLUE EYES
QUITE ATTRACTIVE
AND A VERY
GOOD STUDENT.
DOES SHE
LOOK LIKE
THIS GIRL?
YES, SHE DOES.
I DON'T RECALL
THAT OUTFIT.
YES, SHE IS
QUITE ATTRACTIVE.
SHE IS A VERY
GOOD STUDENT.
NETTIE!
I LIKE MY SPURS
VERY MUCH, MR. SMITH.
THEY BELONGED
TO MY FATHER
AND HIS FATHER'S
FATHER'S FATHER.
I'D LIKE TO HAVE BACK
THE PIECE YOU'VE STOLEN.
TECHNICALLY,
IT WASN'T STOLEN.
BUT, YOU SEE, ROSITA--
ROSITA?
MY ROSITA
MEANS MORE TO ME
THAN A FAMILY BAUBLE.
THERE'S THE BOY.
THEY'RE ALL OVER
THE PLACE.
SEEMS YOUR PLAN
HAS TAKEN
AN UNEXPECTED TURN
FOR THE WORSE, THOMAS.
SPARE SPURS.
SPOILED BY
SPARE SPURS.
TRY SAYING THAT
THREE TIMES FAST.
SPOILED BY SPARE SPURS.
SPOILED BY SPARE SPURS.
SPOILED BY SPARE...
SHUT UP!
SORRY, JUST STARTING TO GET
WORRIED ABOUT THE BOY.
DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL HURT HIM?
I'M GONNA HURT YOU IF
YOU DON'T SHUT UP!
KID DURANGO.
ALWAYS RIDING IN BACK.
YOU CAN RIDE IN FRONT
ON THE WAY HOME.
NO, NOT THE WAY HOME!
NOW! IT'S YOUR TURN.
I'M NOT GOIN' IN BACK
WITH YOUR
GODFORSAKEN PET.
DON'T CALL HIM
GODFORSAKEN.
QUIET!
HELLO, GENTLEMEN.
I'LL HANDLE THIS.
THEY'RE MY PEOPLE.
NICE PANTS.
THESE ARE
NOT MY PEOPLE.
DAMN IT! I KNEW WE
SHOULD'VE TAKEN
A RIGHT AT
THAT LAST FORK.
THROW DOWN
YOUR WEAPONS.
GUYS, SETTLE DOWN.
WE GOT NO QUARREL
WITH YOU. WE'RE JUST
DELIVERIN' SUPPLIES.
COLLINS CATERING.
HOW DO YOU DO?
I WOULD TO INTRODUCE
MY ASSISTANTS.
THIS IS BOB.
BEBE. WE HAVE FINE WINES,
DELICACIES, SILKEN ROBES...
WHAT'S IN THE BAG?
IS NOTHING.
YOU CAN HAVE
ANYTHING YOU WANT
IN THE WAGON,
BUT DON'T TOUCH
THE BAG, OKAY?
I WILL DECIDE
WHAT I WANT.
AMIGO, I WOULD
RATHER DIE
THAN TO GIVE
YOU THAT BAG.
ANY OTHER REQUESTS?
, THE BAG.
PRONTO.
WHEN MY FAMILY CAME
TO THIS COUNTRY
THEY ENCOUNTERED
INCREDIBLE INTELLIGENCE
AND INCREDIBLE SAVAGERY.
THE MAYANS BUILT THE
PYRAMIDS, CHARTED
THE HEAVENS AND
GAVE US OUR CALENDAR.
BUT THE AZTECS
BROUGHT THE ART OF HUMAN
SACRIFICE TO A NEW HEIGHT.
JESUS!
COME ON!
WHAT THE HELL?
YEEHAAA!
THAT'S ME COMIN',
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT
THAN WRITIN' ABOUT IT?
HE TOOK NETTIE.
WE HAVE TO CATCH HIM.
GOOD OL' BEBE.
SO THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE HERE?
FOR THE GOLD?
THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO
YOU THAN SAVING THE GIRL?
THE GIRL AIN'T
MY PROBLEM.
NETTIE?
NETTIE!
HELLO, LITTLE BOY.
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING?
I WANT THE GIRL.
HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO GET HER BACK?
WITH YOUR
LITTLE STICK?
GIVE UP THE
GIRL, DIABLO.
WHO IS THIS,
LITTLE BOY?
MY NAME
IS KID DURANGO.
KID DURANGO?
AM I TO BE FRIGHTENED
BY THIS NAME?
TRUMAN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS.
YES, I DO.
TRUMAN.
BUT YOU ARE THE GUEST,
I WILL WAIT FOR YOU TO
MAKE THE FIRST MOVE.
TRUMAN, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.
YES, I DID.
I DID.
IT HURTS.
I'M SORRY.
I NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT THE PAIN.
I ASSUMED IT WOULD
BE OVER QUICKLY.
PERHAPS I SHOULD'VE
LOOKED AT HIS HANDS
NOT HIS EYES.
YOU'RE RUINING A
PERFECTLY GOOD SCARF.
I'M SORRY.
I WANT YOU TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME.
ANYTHING,
I'LL DO ANYTHING.
KILL HIM.
KILL EL DIABLO.
COMPLETE THE STORY, BILLY RAY.
TRUMAN, YOU'RE
NOT GONNA DIE.
I KNOW.
I'VE NEVER
FELT SO ALIVE.
IN WHOSE ARMS ARE YOU
GOING TO DIE, LITTLE BOY?
HE DIDN'T EVEN
GO FOR HIS GUN.
I WAS GETTING BORED.
I'M A BUSY MAN.
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE
ME TO SHOOT YOU?
I WILL GIVE YOU THE CHOICE.
WHERE?
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
THE STOMACH.
IT IS VERY PAINFUL AND
IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO DIE.
BUT MAKE A DECISION
QUICKLY, PLEASE.
YOU HAVE SEEN,
I'M AN IMPATIENT MAN.
HOW ABOUT YOU
JUST WING ME
ON THE SHOULDER
RIGHT ABOUT HERE.
YOU ARE VERY FUNNY,
LITTLE BOY.
I THINK MAYBE
DIABLO!
FINALLY, SOMEONE WHO IS
WORTHY OF THE CHALLENGE.
CUT THE BULLSHIT,
EL DIABLO.
MAKE YOUR MOVE.
YOU WANT A CHAW?
YOU WANNA
TRY AGAIN?
DAMN, BOY! YOU SHOT
HIM IN THE BACK.
WELL, HIS BACK
WAS TO ME.
I FORGOT.
.
YOU DID GOOD, BOY.
.
THERE'S NOT MUCH
TO SAY, EXCEPT
I DON'T PLAN TO JOIN
YOU NO TIME SOON.
.
LOOK AT THAT.
THAT'S BILLY RAY.
MY GOD! IS THAT
NETTIE TULEEN?
ISN'T THAT BILLY RAY?
SURE LOOKS DIFFERENT.
HE USED TO WEAR
A HAT, DIDN'T HE?
SHE'S COME BACK.
DIDN'T THINK WE'D
SEE THAT BOY AGAIN.
THANK YOU.
COMIN' BACK,
BILLY RAY?
SOMEDAY.
DID YOU KILL
EL DIABLO, BILLY RAY?
ONLY GOD CAN KILL
THE DEVIL, CHARLIE.
THAT'S RIGHT, BILLY RAY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
.
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE WRITIN' ABOUT
NO WHITE BOY WITH A
FANCY HAT AND SHIRT.
I WANNA HEAR ABOUT
THE WAY IT REALLY IS
HOW YOU SQUARE OFF
WITH ANOTHER MAN.
LOOK HIM RIGHT IN THE--
IN THE BACK?
RIGHT.
LOOK ANOTHER MAN RIGHT IN THE
BACK AND YOU SHOOT HIM
BEFORE HE KNOWS
WHAT HIT HIM.
