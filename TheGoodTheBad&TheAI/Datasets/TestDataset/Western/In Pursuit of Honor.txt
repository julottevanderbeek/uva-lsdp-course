IN PURSUIT OF HONOR
The climax of the Bonus
Army's two-month siege...
...Is rapidly developing in the
shadow of our nation's capital.
Since early June,
nearly 18,000 veterans...
...of the Great War of 1917,
many homeless and starving...
...have been camped with their
families on Anacostia Flats...
...demanding payment of their
promised soldiers' bonus.
Today, one policeman and one
Bonus Marcher were killed...
...In skirmishes with local police...
...prompting President Hoover
to order the U. S. Army...
...under the leadership
of General MacArthur...
...to remove the veterans.
Fifteen hundred federal troops. a
combined force of Infantry, cavalry...
...and the newly-formed
armor division...
...have responded to the President's call
to put an end to the veterans' rebellion.
General, any thoughts about
gong against former soldiers?
Watch me.
We want what's coming to us.
WE DEMAND IMMEDIATE
PAYMENT OF THE BONUS
Regimental Sergeant,
break out the colors!
Major Hardesty, sir, I think
they know what army it is.
Do as ordered without
insubordination, Sgt. Libbey.
Break out the colors!
In line right and halt!
Draw!
Sabers!
I gave an order, Sergeant.
Your order goes
against my conscience.
These men served with us in France.
They're only asking for
what they were promised.
This is mutiny, Sgt. Libbey.
You're under arrest, mister.
You and these men, return to post.
Under your own recognizance.
Advance!
The attack Is on. General
MacArthur Is In command.
The Army of the United States
Is attacking Its own veterans|
Their camps are being destroyed|
This Is a national disgrace...
...one of our country's
darkest hours...
TEXAS
Damn it.
Are you okay?
What do you think you're doing?
I was walking.
The roads are for automobiles!
Yeah, if you got one.
You look okay to me.
Where are you headed?
Down to the border.
Get in the car!
What?
I said, "Get in the car," idiot!
There's a dust storm.
Much obliged.
Marsh Buxton, ma'am.
Only my good friends
call me an idiot.
Jessica Stuart, and I'm
not your good friend.
Kinda takes your
breath away, doesn't it?
Cowboy soldier.
I should've guessed.
Excuse me.
Sir! Bachelor officers'
quarters are the last building...
...at the left side of the drill
field. Regimental HQ is in front of us.
Thank you, Private.
About the woman, sir.
Lady friends are off-limits
at this time, sir.
With all due respect...
...she isn't my friend.
I'm Jessica Stuart, Private.
Stuart? As in Colonel Stuart, ma'am?
Holy Moses!
The commanding officer's daughter?
Kinda takes your
breath away, doesn't it?
Let's see, you were fourth
in your class at West Point...
...you speak three languages...
...and according to this, you're
just about expert in everything.
I don't understand something. Why
would they take a man so special...
...and waste him, send him out
to a godforsaken place like this?
I don't...
Now I understand!
Listen!
Maybe you'd like to enlighten me...
...as to this incident here...
...of you striking an
officer at your last post.
It was a soldier's fight, sir.
He was abusing his horse...
...and I stopped him.
Did you win?
Yes, sir, I did.
Let me ask you a question.
You have trouble with authority?
Yes, sir.
You'll have no trouble
with authority here.
Let me explain that
to you, all right!
The cavalry's in enough
trouble now. Discipline...
...is critical to our morale...
...and essential for survival,
yours and mine, understood?
You'll carry out your orders
and you'll do them smartly.
And if there's one iota of
insubordination in your eyes...
...you'll face charges!
-Am I understood?
-Yes, sir.
-Can't hear you.
-Yes, sir!
That's much better.
Okay.
Now, since you're
attached to the 12th...
...and I had the honor of
serving with your father...
...I'm gonna have Sgt. Rutherford...
...amend your records.
Then, you'll be able to
start here with a clean slate.
Thank you, sir.
Dismissed.
Jessica.
Father.
Back, back...
'Evening, Mr. Quinlain.
'Afternoon, Top.
You got that stud
working for you good, Tom.
He's coming along.
Hello, Ahab.
-'Afternoon, sir.
-Gentlemen.
-Master Sergeant Libbey.
-Marshall Buxton.
May I present Sgts.
Quinlain and Mulcahey?
-Pleasure, sir.
-It's an honor, sir.
I've been assigned officer in
charge of remounts and stables.
Regulations call for a
quartet of horses for each man.
These all the horses we have?
There's a few more.
Sgt. Quinlain, sound the recall.
They're still grazing, sir.
By any chance, would you be...
...related to a Thomas Buxton, sir?
He was my father.
May I say, sir, that he was
one hell of a fine horseman.
The best, sir.
God love him.
Seems like everyone in
the cavalry knew him.
We wasted the better part of our
youth in the Mexican campaign.
Wasted? Hell, they got the Medal
of Honor at the same ceremony.
It was a sight to behold, sir.
What are you doin' here?
It's a long story
about a quick decision.
An old cavalry trick, sir.
A soldier got separated
from his mount...
...a bugle call would bring
him back, on the double.
Goddamn it, Quinlain! Is
this some kind of a joke?
Sgt. Shattuck...
...can I introduce Lt. Buxton?
Pleased to make your
acquaintance, sir.
Every officer can choose
his own mount, sir.
But personally...
...I favor that sorrel mare.
Hey, get a load of this!
What's going on here?
Not Hardesty.
John.
Owen.
This is a surprise.
They didn't tell me
it was gonna be you.
I wasn't notified until
This is my ADC, Major Forrest.
I'd like to be shown
to my quarters now.
I'll take formal command
at 09:00 tomorrow morning.
So, that's the future.
I feel like an idiot.
I don't think I've ever
seen you out of uniform.
I haven't worn one of these...
...in years.
You look handsome.
Darling, I am a soldier...
...and it hurts me that you...
...disapprove of it.
I don't disapprove of
you, I'm proud of you.
Sure, because I'm out of uniform.
I don't hate the Army.
It's the systematic
stupidity of it that galls me.
I'm glad you write
for the newspapers...
...'cause you got enough opinions...
...to choke a horse.
Sir!
You don't have to do that,
I'm not in the Army anymore.
Sir, we'd like you to have
the Villista standard...
...that we captured at Carrizal.
But I wasn't there...
...I was at Guerrero.
Yes, sir...
...and if you hadn't
been at Guerrero...
...not a man in our unit would've
walked out of Carrizal alive.
Sir.
It's been an honor, sir.
Thank you.
Miss Stuart.
Colonel.
Goodbye, sir.
If you're ever down
Tucson way, drop in...
...and say hello
to an old war-horse.
Thank you, sir, I will.
Stay out of the brig, Mr. Buxton.
I'll do my best, Miss Stuart.
Gentlemen...
...in compliance with
War Department orders...
...the 12th Cavalry is to be
incorporated with the 23rd Infantry.
I'll expect utmost cooperation
from all officers and men.
I will brook no slackness
within my command.
Additionally, by Special Order
AG 474.71: "Subject: Salary.
"Salaries to all enlisted
personnel, including officers...
"... shall be reduced
"Special Order AG
"The saber is discontinued as an
item of issue to the cavalry. "
Finally...
...it has been directed by Chief
of Staff General MacArthur...
...that in these times of
increasing economic hardship...
...the cavalry is to
dispose of excess horses.
With the cooperation of
the Mexican government...
...these remounts will be
driven across the border...
...to be thereby disposed
of, two days hence.
Lt. Buxton, you will be
in charge of this exercise.
Details will be worked
out with Sgt. Gruber.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
Army is the whipping boy of Congress.
Our supporters are either
in insane asylums...
...or the movies.
Major Forrest, dismiss them.
Ten-hut!
Dismissed!
Sir!
I request permission to be
excused from this detail, sir.
Request denied.
Sir!
I cannot, in good conscience,
be part of it, sir.
Cannot?
You'll do as ordered, mister, or
face a goddamned court-martial!
Your conscience be damned!
May I see your written orders?
-You may not.
-Is there a written order, sir?
You're insubordinate.
Dismissed.
Hand it in, son.
Mr. Buxton! Lieutenant!
Better come quick, sir. It's Libbey.
Sergeant!
Sir!
Beg pardon, sir.
Go straight to hell.
You go to hell.
I'm already there.
There's nothing left.
No horses.
No cavalry.
No honor.
Goddamn it.
I hate what this world's becoming.
So do I.
Sergeant...
...carry on.
They should've been
here by now, Sergeant.
Just a couple of minutes, sir.
Have these men fall back.
requested and ordered, sir.
May I remind you, we're
soldiers, not cowboys.
Cowboys use lariats, Mr.
Buxton, soldiers utilize crops.
The pit can handle
only 100 at a time.
Instruct your men to divide
them up and bring them in order.
Yes, sir.
Sgt. Gruber, prepare your men.
I'm not happy about this, Sergeant.
No, sir.
But then, we're cavalry,
you're artillery.
There was a time when
artillery depended on horses.
And they were properly
retired to Fort Sill.
They weren't murdered.
I won't bandy words with you.
Carry on.
Let's cut out 100 of them and
drive 'em down into the pit!
I hate to see this.
Platoon, lock and load.
Ready.
Take aim!
Fire!
God help us.
-We never even killed the enemy
like that. -Shut up, Tom.
We gotta do something.
Like what? You got general
stars on your collar?
Finish it, Sergeant.
targets and fire at will.
This ain't right, Top.
We can stop it, before
they shoot any more.
Stop it, sir?
How?
By moving the remainder
of the horses to safety.
Are you suggesting we steal the herd?
I suggest we take them into
custody before they murder any more.
Take 'em where?
Away from those guns.
Goddamn it, I love those horses,
but this smacks of insanity, sir.
That's insanity.
I suggest you decide now, Lieutenant.
Let's go. Tom!
Watch it!
What the hell do you
think you're doing?
Saving the rest of the remounts.
-This is mutiny!
-No, sir!
A cavalryman's first
duty is to his horses.
Regulations specifically forbid...
...endangering their lives
outside of enemy engagement.
This expedition is an illegal
act by the War Department.
Illegal act?
Yes! Have you seen written orders?
As remounts officer,
you're in charge of this!
I command the infantry.
It's also my belief, since
I've seen no written orders.
I believe my first
duty is to the horses.
Lt. Buxton, you've lost your wits.
Yes, sir.
Cut loose the machine guns now.
-No, sir!
-Sergeant!
Have your men take
possession of those guns!
Damn it, Jack, don't do this!
Now, we'll take possession
of the remounts, sir.
This'll mean Leavenworth.
I will await the results
of the court-martial, sir.
They have to be stopped!
Any suggestions as to how, sir?
Arrest them, damn it!
I doubt they'll submit,
not without a fight.
I've known Jack Libbey 20 years.
Not a man I'd care to tangle with.
Damn them!
Yes, sir.
And you just let them go?
Begging the Colonel's
pardon, we thought it was...
I'll remind you, Major, we're
under War Department orders!
Where are they now?
They could be anywhere, but
I think they'll held north.
North!
North indicates a vast area, Major.
North is all of America!
Sergeant.
Cable the details of this fiasco to the
War Department requesting instructions.
Major.
Assemble the regiment.
I want "B" Troop patrolling
the Mexican border.
The mechanized column
will move north.
I want those men taken.
I want their hides framed
and hanging on my wall!
Yes, sir.
May I speak, sir?
Be concise and
constructive, Sergeant!
There's a lot of open
country out there.
They know how to move quietly
and cover their tracks.
Four hundred horses
aren't easy to hide.
No, sir, but there's desert
and canyonland to the north...
...and not many paved roads.
So, your vehicles will be worthless.
My vehicles will do
quite well, mister.
They'll transport a squadron of your fine
troopers to within striking distance...
...and you'll effect the
capture of the renegades.
Yes, sir.
Colonel.
If they refuse to
surrender, then shoot them.
The genie's out of the bottle, sir...
...we don't have the cork.
What now?
Tell you the truth,
Sergeant, I haven't a notion.
What insane hell have
we gotten ourselves into?
Trouble?
We've gotten ourselves
into a lot of trouble.
Sir.
Col. Hardesty is
bound to come after us.
And soon.
Head north by northwest.
Meet me at a place called
Broken Hill. You know the spot?
I do indeed, sir.
And you?
If I ride hard, I can
make Tucson by tonight.
I'll catch up with
you sometime tomorrow.
Well, now.
We're out here, on our own, no plan.
An officer that couldn't
lead flies to shit.
And Shawn here says, "Well,
now... " like a priest.
That's one scared little lieutenant.
Let's not count him out...
...yet.
It's the tread. This
tank's not going anywhere!
Move it!
I need to speak with your father.
Oh, God Almighty!
The Army has gone mad.
So, then, you and your men...
...you conspired to mutiny.
There were no written orders.
I don't consider it mutiny.
May I remind you that you are
an officer in the U. S. Army.
You have taken an
oath to obey orders...
...whether they're written or not!
Sir.
Gen. MacArthur has decided
that the cavalry is obsolete.
He may be right, I do not know.
When they muster the troops, they
thank them and wish them well.
They don't march them behind
the barracks and shoot them.
The cavalry is men and horses.
We have a tradition, and
a duty to protect them.
They fight and die beside us,
they deserve the same respect...
...and the same honor.
Well...
...it's a point of honor, all right.
Given the situation...
...if I was in your position...
...I hope to God I could do the same.
Stop gaping, woman!
Now, what's your plan?
Well, Hardesty is south.
I thought we might move north.
That's not a plan,
that's a direction!
The truth is...
...with all due
respect to the Army...
...nothing at the Point
prepared me for this.
I don't know what
rules apply anymore.
I was hoping...
...that you could help me.
I don't know what to do, sir.
First of all, sit down.
You've fallen out of the
fold, that's for sure.
The War Department will
give you little mercy.
Gen. Douglas MacArthur
will give you none!
Now, you have to make a choice.
You can either fall
back, or go forward.
Back is wrong, sir.
There you are.
That's your first,
willful conscious decision.
And that's what makes a leader.
-You got a map?
-No, I haven't, sir.
Here you are...
...one map...
...one compass...
...and that's about
all the help you'll get.
-Thank you, sir.
-Another thing.
Listen to Sgt. Libbey,
he's a hell of a soldier.
I will, sir.
Lieutenant.
Good luck.
Thank you.
You're a damn boy scout, aren't you?
What do you mean?
Stealing 400 horses from
the Army to save them.
You're out of your mind.
I don't exactly consider it stealing.
They were about to be destroyed.
I wish you luck, Lieutenant.
Thank you.
You'll need it.
You could've been more generous.
I gave him the best advice I could.
You gave him a map,
and sent him on his way.
-What'd you want me to do, join him?
-I don't know.
You can't just leave him out there.
I did everything I could do!
You're retired. Not dead.
-I know what I can do. -Sure,
you're going to write your article.
You know what'll happen?
No publisher in the
country will print it.
Gen. MacArthur will see to that.
You know MacArthur.
You go to him and
tell him to stop this.
Come on, please, don't be ridiculous.
You just go ahead.
You write your article.
Let me...
...think about it.
Papa, there's lots of horses coming!
In a minute, son. I
have a problem here.
Hell's bells, I can't see
through all this steam.
Sure this is the right place, Jack?
It's Broken Hill.
Jack!
Shame, he gave up a damn good career.
We threw away a damn good
retirement, didn't we?
Welcome back, sir.
You seem to know this
country pretty well.
My father and I hunted here when
I was a kid, but that's about it.
From here north...
...it's guess work, map
work and a whole lot of luck.
North, sir?
We've got to keep moving, find
a place to wait out the Army.
That's a bit like
waiting out God, sir.
Can't be done.
North is either sparse and dry,
or wet and cold this time of year.
North's as good a choice as any.
Travel at night, sir?
May I suggest that we travel
by day as much as possible.
Make better time.
Good, then.
We'll leave in two hours,
if you men are up to it.
We're not that old, sir.
We just look like it.
Mulcahey, you and Quinlain and Shattuck
tend to the horses, then get some rest.
What do you think Hardesty'll do?
I think if he finds us,
he'll try to engage us.
I've never been in combat.
You have.
-Perhaps you're better qualified...
-Beg your pardon, sir.
This is your detail.
I hope it doesn't come to
combat, but if it does...
...there's nothing I can tell you that
you won't learn in the first 5 seconds.
Sir, Hardesty's traveling
nearly 30 miles an hour.
At that rate, they should
engage them by nightfall.
Thank you, ma'am.
-Where do you think they are now?
-Probably in the White Mountains.
And the Army?
They're probably running around the
mountains looking for a paved road...
...trying to catch 400 horses
they know nothing about.
How long since you
were in Washington?
Washington...
I've been there eight
or nine years ago.
The last time I was there...
...I was with your mother.
She loved army life.
But she hated to travel.
Mother did not love
the Army. She loved you.
Same difference.
Big difference.
Are we going to go on for
the rest of our lives...
...just butting heads?
Probably.
You're just like your mother.
No, I'm not.
I'm like you.
Hey!
I'll tell MacArthur you send
him your love. How's that?
Easy.
Steady.
This is just the damn beginning.
We're pushing them too damn hard.
It's hopeless, goddamn it!
I'll let you know when
it's hopeless, Mr. Shattuck!
Until then, we're moving
north, hard and fast.
How many more die before that?
I don't know. Some will.
If you wanna quit, why
don't you quit right now?
No, sir.
Well done, sir.
Damn it, it's going to cost us a day.
Capt. Novadin.
Proceed north across the
river with the mounted troop.
Yes, sir. You'll remain here?
No. We'll move to the northwest.
We'll operate as a pincer,
with the deserters between us.
You will locate them,
drive them to us...
-... we'll bring this matter to a close.
-Yes, sir.
Major, offload the horses!
Get these goddamned
trucks turned around!
Break out the mounts!
Yes, sir.
Let's turn these trucks around.
I need a mechanic. This
goddamn radiator's shot.
Fifty miles should take us
just west of Rock Springs.
Address the Lieutenant.
Sir.
Dust, sir.
That's a mounted patrol.
They're at least 30 miles off.
So much for grazing
the green pastures.
Let's get that herd moving.
Moving where, sir?
Up there, Mr. Quinlain.
We go up there. It's our only choice.
You heard him, boys. Let's go.
The General sends his apologies,
but his schedule is full right now.
He can't be that busy.
You tell him I'll be back.
-I don't...
-Tell him I will be back...
...tomorrow, and the day after
that, and the day after that!
I want a word with that man!
It's a fascinating story!
Why are you giving it to me?
There isn't a paper in the country willing
to be the first to criticize MacArthur.
So, if I publish photos and
file the story in London...
The press over here
will have to pick it up.
Good boy, Ahab.
Indians!
How many?
A thousand or so.
I knew it. Where?
Montana.
What are you talking about?
The horses.
I don't follow your
thought, Lieutenant.
The Sioux Reserve is right here...
...just below the Canadian border.
There are about 1,000
Indians on a lot of land.
They all love horses.
It's good grazing country, too.
Are you suggesting the cavalry
give its horses to Indians?
That's exactly what I'm suggesting.
Don't that beat all?
Army'll go in and get 'em back.
That's the beauty of it.
By law, they have to be
treated as a separate nation.
No federal troops are
allowed on the reservation.
It's a fine plan, sir.
It's decided then: Indians.
The Indians riding cavalry mounts...
...my granddaddy'd never forgive me.
When you get to hell, don't tell him.
Beg pardon, Colonel.
These are my men.
You mind if I take a look?
I could get my ass
handed to me for this.
They're pushing us,
straight to Hardesty.
The main unit will be ahead.
Looks like they've
got us all sewn up.
Nothing that's sewn,
that can't be unsewn.
I just don't see any way around them.
Go back to your
cavalry tactics manual.
Genghis Khan knew a trick or two.
You know what that means?
Yes, sir, I do.
Tonight.
Lead with the geldings.
That way they won't nicker.
No mares, no warnings.
Let's get back.
-If they're ready and waiting?
-And what if they shoot?
I mean, do we shoot back?
They're not the enemy.
Like hell, they're not.
It didn't stop them at Anacostia.
To them, we're deserters.
They're gonna be shootin'
at us. I'm shootin' back.
We aren't shootin' back.
We just have to break
through, and we're gone.
It'll take them time
to regroup and follow.
We're in Montana
now, we have a chance.
Unload your weapon, James.
You hear that? Everybody up!
-It's a stampede!
-It's the horses!
Get up!
Sons of bitches!
-We did it!
-Did you see that camp go down?
It's gonna take them
soldiers days to regroup!
There's still a mounted
patrol behind us.
Now they know where we are.
I suggest deliberate
and steady going.
Take no chances and
little forage, sir.
All right, Top.
Christ Almighty!
We'll have to close that
wound or it'll take infection.
God!
Ready, Top?
Yes, goddamn it, do it.
The General will see you now.
It's been two weeks.
I'm getting calls, Owen.
Calls from a newspaper in London.
Today, I even got an inquiry
from the Washington Chronicle.
Rumors are rampant.
The President is asking questions.
I'm to meet with him next week.
I hold you and your
daughter responsible.
You always did blame somebody
else when your plans failed.
I have to battle Congress and Roosevelt
on a daily basis to keep this army alive.
I understand.
No, you don't.
Hitler's rebuilding the German army.
Last month he met Mussolini in Venice.
There's talk of a pact.
C'mon now, it's peace time.
The Japanese are
expanding into China.
War is around the corner, Owen.
Modern war, and we're not ready.
I have nothing against the horses.
They've outlived their time.
They're soldiers to us. They go in
battle with us, they get wounded!
Time and time again,
they've saved our lives!
They're not worth what
it costs me to feed them!
The Germans and the
Japanese have tanks.
Good tanks, fine
tanks, in great numbers.
We have 12.
Twelve tanks in the
entire U. S. Army.
I can't afford a
cavalry we can't use.
What about the men?
They're good men, just
trying to do their duty.
Put yourself in their shoes!
But then, who would be in mine?
No, Owen, these soldiers of yours,
these renegades, will be caught.
They'll face a
general court-martial.
They'll be convicted and
punished appropriately.
The horses will be
destroyed as I have ordered.
This is a time of a great
depression. The people need heroes...
No!
God help you when the public finds out
about your actions! They'll devour you!
Even if they could, they wouldn't.
I'm General Douglas MacArthur.
The country needs
me, and they know it.
You're dismissed.
General...
...I'm not in the Army, anymore.
Hut!
Lieutenant!
Lieutenant!
These six are finished.
Ahab's feet are split
clean-through, Top.
They're finished.
They'll slow us down.
We can't compromise the herd.
Form them into a parade, and do
it quick, before the 12th is on us.
Top?
Do not look to Top for
confirmation! I gave a direct order.
Shit!
It had to come to this, didn't it?
At least we're not herding them
into pits and slaughtering them.
Lieutenant!
I'll handle it.
We've got them, Sergeant.
Let's go!
I'll see you in hell, Ahab.
Let's move out.
Colonel!
They were sighted northeast of here.
My opinion is, they're attempting
to cross at the Sioux Reserve.
We'll move to flank them.
Sir!
Move out smartly, Corporal.
Good move, Buxton.
Good move.
Montana.
I'll cable London.
C'mon, c'mon!
They cut 'em off.
Mulcahey, scout the
left and southern flanks.
Whoa!
Get after them!
No!
Sergeant, I order you to stop!
Nothing more can be done for him now.
He was following an order.
My order.
You gave a soldier
an order, he obeyed.
There's always a price.
We gotta keep moving, sir.
We got the 12th on our ass.
And we're flanked over there.
You think we could get
past them to the reserve?
No, sir.
Then, it's Canada.
Canada?
We'll have to make
a run for it and...
...pray there's no one at the border.
-Mount up!
-What about Mulcahey?
If you want to give him
a funeral, start digging.
Ready when you are, sir.
Corporal, organize a detail.
Prepare Mr. Mulcahey's
body for transportation.
What are you doing? We have
to keep after those men.
Take charge of it for proper burial.
This man was a renegade and a thief.
There's been no court, no review!
This man was a soldier!
We'll treat him with dignity.
You'll face charges for this.
If you wish to pursue and
single-handedly capture them...
...I'm sure the War
Department will commend you.
Not one of my men moves until
this soldier's taken care of.
No sign of them.
How do you figure that?
It's Mulcahey. He took care of
their horses better than anyone.
-They pay their respects and give us time.
-You used a dead man!
Goddamn right, I did!
And I'd do it again.
That'll be Hardesty
coming to intercept us.
All right!
This is us. This is Milk
River at the Canadian border.
This is Hardesty.
And the main body of the 23rd
will probably cut us off here.
-I'm too goddamn old for this, Jack.
-Quit.
The whole goddamned
regiment's chasing us!
I don't even know what
we're doing anymore!
You're free to back out, James.
You, too, Shawn.
With your permission, sir.
We traveled nearly
If you men wanna stop now...
...you go ahead, no blame from me.
Christ on a crutch!
Hell, I've never been a quitter.
And neither is Shattuck.
Are ya?
No, I'll stick, you
goddamn son of a bitch!
C'mon!
Well, then, let's go to Canada.
To the right is Milk River
and the Canadian border.
That's the main encampment,
over there. Two miles, I'd say.
They're in a good position.
They'll move fast when they spot us.
I suggest we move slow,
so we don't raise dust.
We'll rest the remounts
for the final dash.
We might just make it.
Yes, sir...
...we might.
Good afternoon! This
area's restricted.
We're the press, Corporal.
No civilians allowed.
This is Miss Jessica Stuart.
I'm Evan Buckley, a photographer
for the London Tribune.
Please step out of
the car, Miss Stuart.
I'm going to escort Miss
Stuart to Col. Hardesty.
We'll have to detain you here, sir.
Am I under arrest, Colonel?
You're way off-limits
here, Miss Stuart.
You will be detained until
this exercise is over.
As for the deserters, we're ordered
to shoot to kill if necessary.
That's official. From
MacArthur himself.
Not many men get that order.
I have the privilege of
attacking my own men, again.
Twice in one career.
You could choose to ignore it.
I won't.
I've been taught to
obey and follow orders.
I will not do otherwise, Miss Stuart.
Being Army yourself,
you should understand.
The chief of staff is building a new,
modern army out of the ruins of the old.
This is insanity.
Certainly.
What would you have me do?
Give them a chance.
-File a protest with MacArthur.
-I already have.
Then file another.
-I've sent a wire.
-Wait for an answer.
I have my answer, Miss Stuart!
If you think I won't report
this, then think again.
When you fire on those men, I will
witness it and I will not be silent.
Corporal!
Keep Miss Stuart company.
Contact headquarters.
Advise them we have the renegades
in sight and under the gun.
Mounties.
You think they're there to stop us?
No, they're waiting
with cookies and milk.
A damned white flag?
Maybe they're surrendering.
You're outmanned and outgunned.
Looks like you've lost
a good number of horses.
We can still save what's left.
You'd risk your life?
Your men's lives on a whim?
-They're on the table.
-Christ, Jack.
We got four 75 mm
howitzers on your flank!
-Orders are shoot to kill.
-Give it up, man.
Stand the court. At least
there's some honor in that.
We're not surrendering the horses.
You do whatever you have to do.
He's young and headstrong.
You and the others are just
plain fools, Sgt. Libbey.
In your eyes, I suppose so.
Let's go!
We're pretty spread out for a dash...
...and it's gonna have to be a dash.
Spread out ain't so
bad. Is it, Mr. Quinlain?
Not a bit.
Looks like I lead.
With your permission, sir.
Take the point, Sergeant.
Take the right flank, Shattuck.
I reckon we could
take it from here, sir.
Meaning what?
Shattuck, Quinlain and me,
we're kind of like the buffalo.
We've had our day.
We're lucky we lived this long.
But it doesn't have
to end for you here.
You can turn back now...
...stand the court.
Hell, blame it on us.
I'd be honored to take the blame
for any crime you committed.
Are you suggesting I relinquish
command of this detail?
No, sir.
Good, then.
Carry on.
C'mon, Quinlain.
Hello, darlin'! Did you miss me?
Move it, move it!
My God.
All right, outta the truck. Let's go!
Adjust the guns.
Elevation?
-Forty degrees!
-Range find!
One thousand yards!
-Elevation?
-Forty degrees!
One thousand yards.
Elevation?
Forty degrees!
Colonel! Stop! They've
been granted full pardon.
-By whom?
-Roosevelt! Read it!
Before it's too late.
It's already too late.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Well done, Sergeant.
They fired high and wide.
It would appear so.
Forrest never was much
of an artilleryman.
Like hell.
Are we under arrest?
Have you broken a law in Canada?
We came over the river uninvited.
That you did. But I consider
it a minor infraction.
What are your plans for the horses?
Only to keep them alive.
What about you, lads? You
gonna make yourselves useful?
It'd be nice to have a new bunch
of fellows to tell my lies to.
TO COL. OWEN STUART WAR
DEPARTMENT COMMS OFFICE
MEN AND HORSES SAFE
IN CANADA LOVE YOU DAD.
JESSICA.
I'm glad somebody else likes horses.
Well, we made it, sir.
Two thousand miles.
Another long story
about a quick decision.
Where you headed?
I reckon I spent
enough time in the Army.
I'm thinkin' about the Yukon,
see what that looks like.
Alaska? Good God.
We've been heading north for so long,
kind of hard to change direction.
And you?
You told me that you hated
what this country was becoming.
I do, too.
I wanna help change it.
I'm gonna go back
and stand the court.
I hope you kick their ass.
I do too, Top.
You take care, Jack.
You too, sir.
C'mon!
No animals were harmed during
the making of this film.
