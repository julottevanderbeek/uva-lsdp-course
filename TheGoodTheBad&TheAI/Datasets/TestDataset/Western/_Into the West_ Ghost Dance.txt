pine ridge reservation
south dakata
march,1890
and clara nhad left pennsylvania.
robert had seen the land's
promise turn bitter,
but he was determined to carry on
the best way he knew how.
yeah,the burial scaffolds
are outlawed now.
lot of things have changed since
they split up the reservation last year.
now you've got pockets
of white settlers all over.
i imagined it
so differently.
is a long time,george.
stand aside,please.
you give something.
these rations are property
of the u.s. government.
i'm just the man
who delivers them.
government
have no stomach.
you're going to have to get
your rations from agent royer.
royer.
i'm sorry for your plight,
but there's nothing
i can do.
now please stand aside.
when your children
cry for food,
you will do nothing?
do you people
want your rations or not?
pay attention. next.
no distribution
till the line is straight.
can't you people understand
what straight means?
next.
metal breasts
what's the news,
wheeler?
well,you're the reporters.
you tell me.
looks like he's got
nothing for us...
as usual.
well,i'm sorry
to disappoint your readers.
you'd think with all the hauling
you do between here and standing rock
you'd see at least one
young buck on the warpath.
you know,you boys could stand
to get out of the agency for a spell.
why don't you talk
to george?
he just arrived here on the
overnight out of new york city.
i'm sure he'd be happy
to share his impressions.
next.
royer around?
you know he never shows
his face on issue day.
next.
only coffee,flour,
and blanket this month.
- no meat?
- no meat,no sugar.
- flour,coffee,blanket.next.
- want bacon.
children very sick.
need food.
bacon is meat.
next.
ingrates.
you holding back
on us here,wheeler?
why i want to talk
to royer.
a little business matter.
next.
no long hair.
no more than one wife.
no heathenish ways.
no old religion.
no drinking.
no language but english.
if you can accept
these things,
then step over there
and pick up your uniforms.
indian police are doing well.
well,can't blame 'em for
wanting something better,i suppose.
things took a bad turn
back in '88.
crops failed
two years running.
and the indians weren't
the only ones who suffered.
we were
damn near wiped out.
but clara,the boy,
and me,
we saw ourselves
through.
she can't wait
to see you.
"to see a world
in a grain of sand,
"and heaven
in a wild flower,
"hold infinity
in the palm of your hand
and eternity in an hour."
isn't that
a wonderful thought?
to see a world
in a grain of sand.
how many times do we look
without seeing?
poetry teaches us
to see things in a different way.
there's no reason
to be afraid of it.
who wants to try?
read among
yourselves. quietly.
quite a dapper eastern
gentleman you've become.
yeah. it's good
to see you,miss clara.
don't be so formal.
it's just plain clara now.
yes,ma'am.
i believe i'll let you two
get reacquainted.
i've got some business
with royer.
come meet my pupils.
class,i want you to meet
george voices that carry.
george was a student of mine
a long time ago.
he used to live here
in pine ridge.
now he's come back,
i hope to teach.
no,not to teach.
to learn.
i have lived among
the white men for many years,
but i am still lakota...
like you,
and there is much
to learn from our people.
congress sets the policy,
mr. wheeler.
i'm merely charged with
carrying out its intent.
the beef allotment to this agency
has been reduced by one million pounds.
washington takes its census
numbers quite seriously.
well,it seems pretty damn
short-sighted,if you ask me.
and what about
this bill of lading?
- couldn't bring myself to refuse 'em.
- they were starving.
i'll pay for
the lost goods in full.
your charity only exacerbates
a difficult situation,mr. wheeler.
you may want to have
a look at this.
my colleague at standing rock,
mr. mclaughlin,
informs me that rumors
of an indian messiah
are spreading like wildfire.
he reassures me
it is only a minor annoyance,
but i have my doubts.
well,no telling where
desperate people will find hope.
i can only do so much,
mr. wheeler.
more than that
i am not allowed.
these people are suspicious
of any changes.
your predecessor
colonel gallagher
was a hard man,
but fair.
- they'd come to respect him.
- be that as it may
the new administration has
selected me to see to its affairs.
well,maybe when you've been here a little longer--
as you say.
is there anything else
you wish to discuss?
no.
no,i figure
we're through.
i'll say good day then.
let's go,people.
keep it moving.
where is your mother?
our mother can not feed us
sitting bull's camp
standing rock reservation
i'm looking for red lance,
son of white crow,
grandson of running fox.
who looks for
red lance?
his brother,
voices that carry
little brother,
look at you.
did they drink your blood,
turn you into a wasichu?
the wasichu
did not defeat us.
it was the wind and the snow of our
grandmother's land that was our enemy.
and our father
and grandfather?
i'm sorry,brother,
truly.
sitting bull was the last
to give up his rifle and horse.
the long knives,
they promised us land,
but they lied.
they made us prisoners.
all of you?
two years the soldiers
watched over our tipis,
and then long hair
came and took us.
buffalo bill.
he said he would
pay us to be indians.
he showed us how to make faces
and shake our tomahawks around.
i've come to stay,
brother.
this is good.
the messiah's medicine
is powerful
many saw their relatives
in the next world
this dance will make
many problems
does the messiah say we
will fight the white man?
no
when the time comes,
the white man will go away
let the dance be
taught to our people
you believe in this man
wovoka's vision?
i believe in hope
june,1890
red cloud could stop this
nonsense with a word,
but the old codger says
it's nothing to do with him.
as i understand
the dogma,sir,
it shares many of our own
christian principles.
a harmless version of their
outlawed sun dance.
looks more like
a war dance to me.
and you,mr. wheeler,do you consider
this demonstration harmless?
well,this ought to be
interesting,boys.
i don't see
any call for that.
i'll thank you to stay out
of government business,
mr. wheeler.
this obscene display
will cease immediately!
this prayer.
white people pray,
go heaven.
we go heaven,too.
you will stop dancing
and disperse!
we should call him...
young man afraid of indians
get outta my way.
take this down,mr. duffy.
make it fast,lang.
to the editor,
new york herald.
uh,"the long-awaited violence
here finally exploded today--"
"exploded."
i like that.
"when a band of armed hostiles
confronted the government's agent.
"against impossible odds,
"agent royer acquitted
himself without bloodshed
"and brought a well-deserved end
to the...pagan spectacle
known as the ghost dance.
"it is common knowledge in these parts
that the sioux never dance this.
foul dance except for one purpose:
and that is war."
september,1890
you must be jedediah.
you're--you're him.
i reckon i am.
welcome.
welcome.
when a man gets to
a certain age,
he wants to be close to those
folks that mean something to him.
what family
we have left is...
they're still
in these parts.
but it has all
changed so much.
makes you wonder what it's
gonna be like 100 years from now.
bigger and faster.
better,i suppose.
don't know
about better.
sir...
do i look anything
like jedediah smith?
there's only one
jedediah smith,son.
but...
let's have a look-see here.
well,if you--you put on
a few pounds
and a few score years,
and...
rounded it off
with a beard,i'd say...
nope. nothing like him.
i often dream of
margaret light shines.
and you've had
no word of her?
no. not a day goes by that
i don't wish i could see my children again.
is she's on the reservation,
robert will find her.
you can count on it.
closer together now,
fellas.
that's it.
all you bucks,give me
a--a ferocious look.
that's good.
all right now.
uh...sergeant,
take the rifle
off the chief
and--and hold it up.
a little higher.
there it is!
hold still now.
"intrepid pine ridge
police sergeants
"old coyote
and yellow earring
"apprehend renegade
hostiles on the warpath
with custer's own rifles."
yeah,that's good.
huh?
that was perfect.
drink up,gentlemen.
thank you so much.
they are gonna
eat this up in new york.
you got permission
for that?
i got permission.
ask royer.
you might have
seen her yourself.
i don't keep track
of faces.
standing rock reservation
you let the fire go out.
didn't notice.
what good are all
these white man's books
if you don't know
when you're cold?
it's not that cold.
you,uh...
read all these books?
there's much
to learn from them.
what good
is this knowledge?
you have many questions,
red lance,but
you have no desire
to hear my answers.
and you do not
wish to learn.
i've told you.
the ghost dance
is only superstition.
spirits can't
help our people.
only we can do that
for ourselves.
you do not have ears.
you will not listen.
i bring you the
promise of a day
when no white man
will treat us badly again
when the sacred dead
will live again
it is impossible for a
dead man to live again
the white hair at the
agency,mclanghlin
says soldiers will
stop this dance
the soldiers will
harm no one
the messiah has
sent me a vision
the shirt is powerful medicine
it will stop the soldiers' bullets
red cloud and big foot's
people are dancing
sitting bull's people
must also dance
cotton will not stop
a lead bullet
no matter what
kicking bear says.
to say "believe"
or "do not believe,"
this is the white man's way.
let them dance
this pernicious item,
gentlemen,
is known as
a ghost shirt.
among its many powers,
it is alleged
to stop bullets.
so let us not deny further
that trouble is imminent.
every one of these hostiles
is prepared to use violence.
i've been
among them before.
question is: what are you
going to do about it?
we can do nothing until the interior
department and the war department
provide explicit
instructions.
until then,
we must all wait
and be on our guard
at the first sign of outbreak.
if you just
leave it alone,
and likely as not,
the whole craze will just
die out on its own.
mr. mclaughlin at standing rock
believes that
as long as a single malcontent
like sitting bull remains at large,
that we cannot
be secure.
and i concur.
if you lock up
the ringleaders--
then you're gonna have
a real problem on your hands...
not just in
your imagination.
is this a ghost shirt?
ghost shirt,savvy?
ghost shirt.
what will you
take for it?
you...and me.
we make trade.
- trade.
- that's right.
you want my camera.
what's a squaw know
about taking pictures.
i'll tell you what.
i'll give you...
two american dollars.
no can do.
it's not for sale.
hey,another camera's
easy to come by.
where in the hell else are you
gonna find another ghost shirt?
lady,you got yourself
a deal.
- how about that?
- that's nice.real nice.
- and bulletproof.
- better not try it.
needs mending.
we best see to it.
look at that.
i'll be doggoned.
i'm gonna go back
to the barn
and get some extra wire
and tools and whatnot,
and we'll--we'll fix her.
they busted in.
won't they just
bust out again?
no,i don't think so.
well,why not?
maybe because this
is the land they remember.
father.
it makes my heart glad
to see you with these children.
you are a good mother
to them.
as you were to me.
my wandering must have
caused you great worry and pain.
forgive me.
you were always
our family's seeker.
but the road you have chosen
has not been easy.
they were
so many times
when i thought
it was impossible to go on.
but i remembered
your strength,
how you carried on even
after we thought father had died.
that was the greatest
gift you gave to me.
you helped me to endure.
to live.
when you're ready,
you look through here,
then you press this button.
i'm happy you
still take pictures.
i didn't...
after sand creek.
but it is
all different now.
"when in disgrace
with fortune in men's eyes,
"i all alone be weep
my outcast state,
"and trouble deaf heaven
with my bootless cries,
desiring this man's art,
and that man's scope."
what do you
say now,mr. wheeler?
do you still
think this craze,
as you call it,
is dying out?
well,i have put up
with quite enough of this lunacy,
and i intend
to do something about it.
duffy,take this down.
to the commissioner
of indian affairs in washington,
wild indians are dancing,
and cannot be
induced to stop.
the ghost dance has now
assumed such proportions,
both in the number,and the spirit
of the adherents,
that it is entirely beyond the control
of the agent and the police force
who are openly defied
by the dancers.
the employees and the government property
of this agency has no protection,
and we are at the mercy
of these dancers.
we need protection,
and we need it now.
this agent suggests
sending a body of troops
sufficient to arrest
the leaders therein,
and imprison them,
and disarm the balance
of the reservation.
nothing short of
a thousand troops,
backed by
the proper artillery,
will stop the proliferation
of this diabolical dance.
god bless ya,boys!
december,1890
colonel forsyth,
we are friends
of the agent.
we are friends
of the soldiers.
the great father's friends
are my friends,too.
i want not any trouble
for my people.
we have no guns
to fight with.
we have
nothing to eat.
we are too poor
to do anything.
you're not too poor
to dance your ghost dance.
many say i have
been to this dance.
that is not right.
my eyes are sore.
they do not
see very well.
but,when they better,
i go and see.
we do not ask you to see it,
we ask you to stop it.
when winter comes,
dancing stops.
there will be
no problems.
many of your people have
taken to the badlands.
if they do not return
we'll have no choice
but to consider them hostile.
they think the soldiers
have come to kill us.
i not believe this,
but they are afraid
for their families.
you understand.
and the warriors
with them?
what's to keep them
from joining up with kicking bear
or the other
renegades?
that is all i have to
say about this question.
"the belligerent
old scalp-taker
"harangued his listeners
with a brazen speech
"in which imminent
hostilities were threatened.
"the army can do nothing until the
murdering redskins have broken out,
"and the young bucks have
burned a dozen ranches,
and slaughtered a score
of women and children--"
general miles' orders
are quite specific.
to offer protection,
and maintain control and discipline.
so we're all just
expected to sit here?
in the meantime,you are
directed not to force any issue
that might result
in an outbreak.
discretion,mr. royer.
if you and the other civilian au
horities had demonstrated as much,
the seventh would not
be here now to enforce order.
what's going on?
word is sitting bull's
headed this way
to join the renegades
in the badlands.
we'll be read for him.
i caution you
against any supply trips
through standing rock
in the next few days,mr. wheeler.
why is that?
general miles has
authorized sitting bull's arrest.
wouldn't it be better
to wait till ration day?
the fewer of
his people around,
less cause there'll be
for a disagreement.
sitting bull's actions
require his immediate apprehension.
well,could be
just rumor.
whatever the people
of the press are telling you.
i provide you this information
with regard to your own safety,mr. wheeler.
what you wish
to do with it
is not my concern.
take it.
i can't.
you are false to your people
if you do not wear the ghost shirt.
this way is the way
to death,red lance.
maybe we can
find our own road.
maybe we can
find our own
destiny again.
what are you doing?
you have
too many wasichu ways.
you even think
like a wasichu!
you play the savage
for money,red lance!not me!
indian police.
what do you want here?
you are my prisoner.
you must
go into the agency.
we were warriors together
now you do the white man's bidding
let go of me!
coming through!
keep moving!
sitting bull
is under arrest.
do not take him!
protect our chief
no!
come with us.
white hair mclaughlin
only wants to talk with you.
don't listen to
these troublemakers.
come on.
december 24,1890
move it to the right
a little more.
apart from a few
minor skirmishes,
most of the fugitives have
been persuaded to return peaceably.
hunger can be a powerful
inducement to surrender.
we've still got thousands
holed up in the badlands,
and no telling how many of sitting
bull's people racing
to meet them.
our principal concern
is chief big foot.
abandoned his camp on the
cheyenne river several days ago.
lieutenant colonel sumner
intercepted him,
and demanded
his immediate return.
big foot
promised to do so,
but during the night,
he slipped away.
where is he now?
we think he intends to join
the rebels in a badland stronghold.
i await word from
our scouting parties.
a very merry
christmas indeed.
he's wanted for the murder
of an indian policeman.
you don't know
the circumstances.
clara,the circumstances
don't matter.
if they catch him,
they'll shoot him.
surely,you're exaggerating.
have you seen
what these
so-called reporters
are writing?
"the murderous redskins
are now whetting their knives
"in anticipation of the moment
when they begin their bloody work."
anybody with eyes in their head
can see the agency's peaceful.
if george did kill somebody,
he did it with provocation.
we'll say a prayer for him.
he has the protection
of tatanka.
that is enough.
where do you come from?
we come from the place where...
the police have killed sitting bull
standing rock
we will go to pine ridge
to red cloud's people
red cloud will help us
we saw sighs of many long knives
if the long knives come
we will talk to them
let there be no fighting
i'm not who
i once was,grandfather.
none of us
are who we were.
it is enough that you have
returned to your people.
i,uh...i killed a man.
not a wasichu.
another lakota.
i saw a darkness
inside of you.
now i understand.
i've lost my center.
the world has
lost its center.
you ready for
your christmas present?
huh?
halt!
december 28,1890
i won't parley with you.
it's either unconditional
surrender or fight.
what is your answer?
we'll fight.
where were you headed?
pine ridge.
make peace.
you lied to our troops
once before.
why should we
believe you now?
no lie.
i'm glad to find you
peaceable.
you and your people will
follow us back to our camp.
we'll provide
blankets,rations.
i'll,uh,
have an ambulance sent forward.
you'll ride
more comfortably.
i guess i'm sick today.
how far is the camp?
called wounded knee.
you can't see 400 people on this
your job is to deliver the required
rations to wounded knee,mr. wheeler,
not to question
the order.
i'm--i'm not questioning it.
i'm just saying.
don't fail to bring back
your keen eyewitness observations.
why don't you climb aboard
and see for yourself?
uh,thanks,wheeler,
but,uh,
i'm forced to remain
in the thick of activity.
yeah.you style yourselves
"war correspondents,"
but the only fighting you've seen
is at the bar at the hillsgate hotel
where you lubricate
your vivid imaginations.
pine ridge,
south dakota.
sunday,december 28th.
the indian war here
has collapsed.
chief big foot's
defeated hostiles
rest fewer than 30 miles
from this agency,
apprehended by the gallant men
of the famed 7th cavalry.
the chief's surrender
is all but certain
to flush out those bands
of renegades
which for too long
have held this agency
and its surrounding settlements
in a virtual state of siege.
all civilized people here
await big foot's return
and give thanks
in this time of peace
that the indian troubles are
about to be brought to a close
without further sacrifice
of life.
here you go.
this is for big foot.
somethin' else
to keep you warm.
army regulation
wool underwear.
this good medicine.
the best.
here,take a pair
for yourself.
go on,take 'em.
he cannot hear.
they say some of sitting bull's
people are here with you.
i'm lookin' for
a friend of mine.
he's young,speaks english.
his name's voices that carry.
i know this man
i cannot go back with you.
i don't understand.
i thought it was possible
to bridge the indian's world
and the white man's world.
- you are that bridge,george.
- no.
when i was back east,people looked
at me as an educated indian.
something different.
a curiosity.
i see that now.
i lived among the white men,
but i never belonged.
and you belong here?
i belong nowhere...
this is what i've learned.
this has been
my real education.
i am grateful to you for everything
you've done for me,my friend.
george.
good-bye.
december 29,1890
the colonel wants your men to
fetch yourselves up to big foot's tent .
parley. you savvy?
come on,get!
parley!
before taking your people
to pine ridge,
we must ask that you surrender
any arms in your possession.
those with guns or rifles
may now step forward
one by one
and lay down their weapons.
who else?
surely this cannot
be all of them.
no more guns.
have i not put you in an ambulance
and have my doctor look after you?
did i not put you
in a good tent
with a stove to make you
warm and comfortable?
did i not feed your people?
yet now,big foot repays
my kindness with lying?
no more guns.
very well.
- sergeant!
- sir.
you and your men search
the village tipi by tipi.
troop! detail!
let me in there.
let me in.
tell that man
to sit down!
when circle finish,
he sit down.
i have lived long enough
where is the rest?
that's the lot
of it,sir.
i was led to believe
this band was better armed.
you. get up.
damn it.
why do you want my gun?
can't you see?
he's deaf!
let go!
nooo!
fire!
no!
fire!
what should we do,sir?!
thy kingdom come,thy will be
done on earth as it is in heaven.
give us this day
our daily bread
and forgive us
our trespasses
as we forgive those
who trespass against us,
and lead us not
into temptation.
what is she saying?
she said they told her
if she put on the dress
the bullets would not
go through.
why would anyone
shoot women and children?
robert! robert!
is he gonna be all right?
looks like
a bad shrapnel wound.
he'll pull through it,
but i can't speak
for the leg.
here. keep that tight.
you're all to return to your
homes immediately and stay there.
until the situation at wounded knee
and the badlands is fully resolved,
this agency
is under martial law.
anyone violating the curfew
or found holding a meeting
will be arrested on site.
can you tell us
what happened out there?
well,reports from the field
are still coming in,
but as best as
i can ascertain,
the indians fired first.
new year's day,1891
what the hell you think
you're doin'?
them's worth
back off now,
you hear me,chief?
leave him alone!
can't you see?he's a holy
man performing a death rite!
who are you?
i am called lovede by the buffalo
my mother is thunder heart woman
help me
that day,
i saw growling bear's vision
come to pass.
my heart was sad,
but our people still live.
we live,
and so we have hope.
well,that's the story as is.
i know how to tell it.
now somebody else might
tell it a little differently.
you see,the only history
a man knows for certain
is that small part
he owns for himself.
you can't forget we're
all part of the same wheel--
the hubs and the spokes
and the felloes.
you break one
and you break the wheel.
when you tell your stories,
you touch your grandmothers
and grandfathers.
and all the ancestors
who walk before them.
and when others ask you
where you know these things,

loved by the buffalo was spared
so i can tell you this story.
i want you to remember
these stories,jedediah.
so when your time comes,
you can pass 'em on.
it's important for people
to know where they came from
and what others
have been through.

i said,
"you are one part virginia
and one part lakota.
be proud of both."
now this story
belongs to you.
