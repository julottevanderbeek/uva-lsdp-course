Rosa,
I saw Saint Sebastian.
He said a miracIe
wiII save the worId.
Many peopIe were foIIowing
aII singing and praying.
Nobody beIieves me.
But I saw him!
He Iooked deep
into my eyes.
It's a miracIe,
Rosa, a miracIe.
Rosa, on Saturday
I'II go to market.
Divide the cattIe
with Moraes.
Maybe I can seII two cows...
and buy a piece of Iand
from him.
If it works out we can pIant
something...
to harvest next year.
It's no use.
I don't know,
we've got to try.
Heaven might
send us a miracIe.
Yes, Rosa, maybe
there'II be a miracIe.
-Morning, Boss.
-Good Morning.
The cows are here,
but four of them are dead.
Did they drink water
from the North weII?
Yes sir, it was
the onIy pIace.
They were bitten
by snakes.
I brought tweIve cows.
Maybe we couId spIit
the Ioss.
There's nothing to spIit,
the dead cows were aII yours.
But Mr. Moraes the cows
had your brand on them.
They couIdn't be mine.
I'm a poor man.
It was an accident,
but it's true.
The snakes bit your cows.
Don't argue!
The Iaw is on my side.
Excuse me, Mr. Moraes
but what Iaw?
-Are you arguing with me?
-No, sir.
But what's this Iaw which
doesn't protect what's mine?
I've aIready toId you
, you're entitIed to nothing.
But Mr. Moraes...
-You can't take what's mine.
-Are you caIIing me a thief?.
You yourseIf are doing so!
My son,
your mother is dead.
not by God's hand.
By a mercenary's gun during...
a fight in the backIands.
I knew it, Rosa.
You didn't beIieve me...
but it was the hand of God
Ied me to the DeviI.
We'II have to go
to Monte Santo...
and ask for St. Sebastian's
protection.
Come on now...
we've nothing to take
with us but our destiny.
Was Don Pedro AIvares CabraI
discovered BraziI.
He had his cavaIry buiIt
of stone and bIood.
This piIgrimage
to Monte Santo...
wiII open
the gates of Heaven...
to the bodies and souIs
of the innocent.
I have waIked from
viIIage to viIIage...
teIIing everyone fire
wiII sprout from the rocks...
to burn the worId.
The Iords of this Iand...
the authorities
and the farmers...
they aII said I was Iying...
and that the sun wouId
be to bIame for this disaster.
Last year I said we'd have
and we had them!
Now I teII you...
On the other side
of this hoIy mountain...
there is a bountifuI Iand.
The horses eat flowers.
ChiIdren drink miIk
out of the rivers.
And rocks turn into bread.
Dust becomes flour.
There's water and food,
the abundance of Heaven.
And every day
when the sun rises...
Jesus Christ and the
Virgin can be seen...
and Saint George.
And my Saint Sebastian...
his chest bristIing
with arrows.
We must show
the authorities...
the power and force
of the Saint.
They removed Dom Pedro
from his throne,
and now try to kiII
those who Iove the Emperor.
But those who wish
to save their souIs...
must foIIow me
from now on...
untiI the day when God's sign
appears in the sky.
A hundred angeIs with
their swords of fire,
shaII come to heraId
our departure,
and open our way through
the darkness of the backIands.
The Iand wiII become the sea
and the sea the Iand.
A man shouIdn't be
another man's sIave.
He must Ieave the Iand
that doesn't beIong to him,
so that he can reach
the fieIds of Heaven.
The poor wiII be rich...
and wiII sit on
the right side of God.
The rich wiII be poor
and stand on the Ieft side
of the DeviI.
We shaII not be aIone,
because the Lord has sent down
warring angeI, to cut out
the heads of our enemies.
I'm condemned
but have courage.
I give my strength to my Saint
so he can free my peopIe.
The Lord be praised.
Do you stiII remember me?
I don't remember anything.
Neither the night
nor the day.
We Iived together.
Back on the farm.
We've been here in
Monte Santo for a Iong time.
You're foIIowing Sebastian
and you Ieft me behind.
I have to be aIone
to reach the Sacred IsIand.
I must Ieave behind
wife and chiIdren.
We'II stay one year
in Monte Santo...
waiting for
the rain of goId.
Then we'II go to an isIand
in the middIe of the sea...
and we'II Iet the fire from
the sky burn this...
RepubIic of disgrace,
once and for aII.
The IsIand doesn't exist.
We have it inside our souIs.
If it doesn't exist...
why must we search for it
aII our Iives?
You have come to be
my strength in peace and war.
You must fight for me.
The IsIand doesn't exist.
Yes it does.
I saw it at
the bottom of the river.
Sebastian said
the isIand doesn't exist...
and that we must
Iive in pain.
I was behind you.
I heard.
You're Iying.
You and aII the others
are faithIess and damned...
but I'm going
to survive and be king.
My cattIe wiII graze
in a green pasture.
That's a dream.
The earth is dry and
wiII never bear any fruit.
Why must you
be sick with hope?
Let us Ieave this pIace
and make a Iiving eIsewhere...
before the Army arrives...
and does the same
as they did in Canudos...
kiIIing men, women
and chiIdren.
If there is a war...
I'II fight a thousand soIdiers
with Saint George's spear.
If the peopIe of Santo die,
I'II create the isIand.
You shaII die.
I shaII die.
No one wiII escape.
Fate is greater than death.
There's goId
in the sea beyond.
Rocks turn into bread,
and horses eat flowers.
You waIk in the dark.
Lost in this dry worId
Under no God or DeviI
There goes Antonio
das Mortes
The kiIIer of
the 'cangaceiro' highwaymen.
Since Sebastian came,
the church has earned nothing...
from christenings
and weddings.
Sebastian is dangerous
to both farmers...
and the church.
The Government
doesn't heIp us.
I aIways said
we have two Iaws here:
The Government Iaw,
and the Iaw of the buIIet.
I never won an eIection
through votes.
If the strong don't unite,
they'II destroy everything.
To kiII a 'cangaceiro'
is dangerous, but it's easy.
We aII remember Canudos.
The troops came
to fight ConseIheiro.
We aII thought it'd
be chiId's pIay...
and Iook what happened.
We mustn't Iet Sebastian
become another ConseIheiro.
PersonaIIy,
I'm not afraid of wars.
I've aIways
Iived with them.
But you know it's dangerous
to interfere in hoIy matters.
Sebastian is a
nenemy of the church.
But the peopIe around
him are Christians.
I haven't seen for myseIf...
but apparentIy
he can work miracIes.
WeII now.
OnIy you can do it.
We'II give you 300 contos
to rid us of the beatified.
Christ drove moneyIenders
out of His tempIe with a whip.
The exampIe is in the GospeI.
So, Antonio?
Do you accept?
It's a Iot of money.
It's a smaII price
to pay to get into HeII.
The priest thinks Sebastian
has a pact with the deviI.
But I think he has
a pact with God, too.
Then you must Ieave here.
Buy a farm, and Iive in peace
for the rest of your Iife.
This is your penitence,
Antonio.
It is onIy when you commit
a great crime...
that you may be forgiven
for the crimes you committed.
That's twice what
they offered you before.
TeII them they can
Iive in peace.
Sebastian is finished.
From here I can see the sea,
and then the Promised Land.
God separated
the earth from the sky.
But he was wrong.
When I put
them back together...
the isIand wiII
be visibIe to aII.
There wiII be happiness,
Rosa.
After the backIands,
the sea!
You must choose.
Go down there.
Bring your wife
and a chiId.
OnIy after Rosa's souI is
washed, wiII you be cIean.
To govern the isIand,
to govern the isIand.
My wife has the deviI
in her!
Tomorrow goIden rain
wiII faII.
The Iand wiII
become the sea...
and the sea wiII become
the Iand!
When we get
to the isIand...
we'II cIean the souIs
of the sinners...
with the bIood
of the innocent.
