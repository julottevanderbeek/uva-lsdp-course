For this, to me,
is what new Australia means
to the landless,
the homeless,
to those who long to be manly,
to be true,
to be what men should be,
to live simply, to work hardly,
to win not the gold that poisons
but the home that saves,
to secure the little ones,
the rearing that is the right
of everyone
brought by us into the world.
We can do it
if we only dare.
Again.
For this, to me,
is what new Australia means.
Birds have been here too.
Dad.
Dad!
Are you all right?
Bloody colony.
Dad!
Stupid bloody thing.
Tie them to that,
that branch.
Only one way in there, and I don't
want anyone else falling foul of it.
Oh!
Try zamba.
Rub it in.
Burns, pimples, piles.
You clown.
Everything's changing.
I miss her too, Tom.
Dad, the rabbiter's here.
- Here. Take them.
- Thanks.
What happened to the horse?
You going somewhere?
They're all digging for gold.
Still planning the ground,
I reckon.
That's not why we came out here.
Useless bloody sack of dirt,
they shatted on us.
They can have it.
It's god's land.
He'll provide.
There's no god here.
God cursed this whole bloody
country for our sins.
Reckon I might pick up a bit
of work on the railroad.
Connolly's railroad...
You'll do the same
if you got any sense.
It's money.
I know you're needing that.
Charlie.
I'm in need of a...
a few cartridges.
Here.
That's all I got
till I get to town.
Good luck to you, Nat.
God be with you, Charlie.
We can't keep doing this, dad.
The rabbiter's right.
It's money we need.
God will provide.
What are we going to do
without a horse?
I won't discuss it.
What about Tom?
What about me?
You've your family to think
about before yourself.
A man's got to marry me
in a corn sack.
Marry?
You're not marrying, girl.
You're needed here, and this
is where you're staying.
It's finished, dad.
It's over.
Even mom knew.
You'll keep your mouth shut!
- Dad.
- What?
What is it, little man?
You think you've got
what it takes?
What are you going to do?
Nothing.
Hello?
Hello in there?
Come away from there.
Come.
What can we do for you?
We have a sick boy here.
Won't last long if we don't get
some shelter for the night.
He's concerned
for the boy's welfare.
Be on our way in the morning.
Go on.
Make way.
There you go, Jimmy.
Yeah.
You'll be all right, son.
Sarah,
make some tea.
What happened?
Hit him on his way up to the
gold fields four days ago.
Grace of god, we found you.
He wouldn't have made it
through the night.
Henry Wilson.
This is Carver.
Nat Dawn.
My son, Tom.
Daughter, Sarah.
Go help your sister.
Come.
Sit by the fire.
Warm yourselves.
Excuse me.
We'll move the boy
out the back in the morning.
It'll be gone tomorrow.
Your mother always said,
"Never turn away strangers."
"They might be angels in disguise."
Thank you, miss.
Very much obliged.
Some interesting items you have
around the place here, Nat.
We brought a fair bit with us.
Oh, she was impressive
when she first went up.
You a carpenter?
I was a teacher in London.
Been back?
You're not missing much.
Seen the boers
living better in South Africa.
Is the mother...
she passed away.
A month now.
I'm sorry.
So you were in the war?
We were.
- And the boy?
- Yeah.
Thought he'd come home
a bloody hero.
Silly bugger.
No.
I'll check the horses.
Horses are fine.
I'll just check.
Let you swells catch up.
Don't worry about him.
Look, we could
help you out a bit.
Picked up a few tricks
along the way.
Return your hospitality.
I'd have to think about it.
We don't even get swaggies
coming through anymore.
Endangered species.
Poor bastards.
I'm with Tom Mooney, myself.
Mooney?
Yankee. Socialist.
Every man should have a vote.
Farm and rifle.
It's what God
brought us here for.
Didn't think to find
anyone this far out.
I figured we'd be planting poor little
Jimmy in the ground by morning.
Reckon you'd call it Providence.
Well, I guess we could do
with a hand.
We don't have much.
I appreciate it.
I really do.
The minute the boy's well enough
to ride, we'll be on our way.
We'll earn our keep.
They're soldiers.
They're going to stay
to help out.
What drives somebody
to go halfway around the world
to kill people
they don't even know?
Don't do that.
Come here.
Give me that.
Well, this was
a pretty good knife once, eh?
Never let a blade
go blunt too long.
Everything all right, Tom?
With the farm?
With your dad?
I suppose.
We're here to help you, son.
We're here to help you
and your dad out.
So if there's anything you need
or anything you want to tell me,
you can.
You know that, don't you?
Yeah.
Reckon you could finish this up?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Reckon you can turn your hand
at just about anything, Tom.
Do you think
they killed lots of boers?
It's perfectly obvious
that man's a murderer.
That boy's going to die here, and we're
all going to be chopped up with an ax.
Tom.
Nat, I reckon we should
start again from scratch,
if that's all right with you.
You do what you think's best.
Tom and I have to check
some traps.
I'd appreciate it
if you stayed away from there.
You have the balls.
Tom.
Who are you?
I'm Sarah.
Love a boy back to life, is it?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Bloody thirsty work
building your locker for you.
And you check that one.
Empty.
Well, they can't all be empty,
can they?
Whoa!
Dad!
This is pretty good!
Very impressive.
Mr. Henry, look at me.
Traps empty?
How's the boy doing?
Sarah?
How's his fever?
- The fever broke earlier.
- Good.
I mean, he looks better,
but he's still...
We'll move him out
to the stables.
Make up a bed for him.
Hey, kid.
Sarah.
You should get the boy
to bag some roos for you.
Outstanding shot.
I shot a wooden boer, dad.
Look.
Boys.
We could take the rifles out
in the morning,
Jimmy's still down.
I shot it off the log.
Come and shoot
some black crows, are you?
Shoot some blackbirds?
What's he talking about?
Nothing.
How about it, Nat?
Carver will stay back and chop
some logs for your new locker.
Eh, Carver?
Yeah.
Sure.
Come on, Tom.
Interesting kid.
Doesn't deserve a man
like that for a father.
What does that mean?
Well, he thinks
he should get it different
just 'cause he's got God
on his side.
Careful, Carver.
Takes three generations
to make a gentleman.
And about three minutes
to unmake him.
We've seen things, Henry,
things other people like.
Counts for something.
Ain't that right?
Yeah.
That's right.
That Jimmy breaking into song yet?
Yeah, he's dancing with a horse.
You were a captain, yes?
Major.
And you, Mr. Carver?
What's it to you?
I'm just interested.
Well, I ain't.
Oh, leave
the glum bastard alone.
He's got a chip on his shoulder
the size of your arm.
You look like you're in
some nativity scene.
What?
Well, you seem better, anyway.
Where's Henry?
Inside talking with my dad.
Where is your family?
Don't know.
Same for Henry,
except worse, I guess, 'cause
he had a wife and kids and all.
Henry sort of fell...
fell to drinking there.
That man Carver,
he drinks a lot.
Ah, he's all right.
He's just got that way
about him.
He's had a rough ride,
no mistake.
He got beat senseless by his father
when he was a little Tucker.
Got brought up by his brother
boundary riding
for the squatters and the like.
Where is he now?
Keep a secret?
So up on the gold fields, right,
we gave it a go.
There was nothing there, so Henry said
we'd go back to the city to find work.
What?
Well, they thought
there was nothing there.
Nothing.
Not a bean.
You had diggers up there gnawing in the
same bone for weeks on end dressed in rags.
Bloody grim sight,
what humanity can sink to,
clawing at the dirt
just for the chance
to strike it rich.
I've seen men reduced to states
you wouldn't wish on a hog.
And this is just about
the worse thing I've seen.
You see it in men's eyes,
desperation.
I won't have alcohol
in my house.
We're weak creatures,
corrupted.
I've seen Mr. Connolly drinking.
Is that right, Tom?
Get yourself to bed now, Tupper.
You're going shooting
in the morning, remember?
Go on.
Hey, hey.
Tupper?
He used to crawl inside
this banged up old stovepipe
of my father's
when he was a baby.
Miss it?
The old country?
No.
It's a strange thing.
The land here, it...
it speaks.
You just...
Listen.
You know, sometimes
you got to go your own way.
Sometimes it's right
to put yourself first.
Do you know what I'm saying?
I got enough here for now.
There's plenty more out there.
It's me big claim.
- What will they do?
- I'll see them right. You'll see.
I'll head back up, and they'll
think I struck it later.
Why are you telling me?
Why are you telling her what?
You're always
sneaking up on people.
You're always sneaking around.
You're like a lizard.
Tell her what, Jim?
Nothing.
Nothing?
You know, you're like
a little brother to me, Jimmy.
You're like a son
to that old man in there.
Got to sell me eights, Carver.
Come on!
Dad!
Quick.
Hmm.
Wonderful day.
Let's load this up
for you, Tupper.
Keep up.
Tom.
Don't go letting off
any stray shells.
Keep your finger
off that trigger.
He's a fine boy.
He's a tribute to his mother.
Your land?
Connolly's.
Our illustrious local landlord.
Peacocked.
The best stretch
is for his bloody railroad.
He's taking back the land and
pushing the small holders out.
Well, let's bag something back
for the working man, shall we?
There you go.
Privileged.
Hey.
That's my damper.
What is it?
Do you really like it here?
Of course not.
So why don't you go?
I can't leave Tom.
I'm going my own way.
No. I can't.
Could help you out.
You could look after it for me,
that thing.
It's here with you now?
You'd be doing me a favor.
Can't keep it from them forever.
They found out I had it,
I don't know what they'd do.
Won't be good for me.
I know that.
I'm serious.
I have to go.
You got your possums here.
Yes. Thank you.
Thought you might be able to
make something nice out of them.
They're easy enough to find
if you know where to look.
Bet you thought I was gonna be old
Henry bloody Lawson, didn't you?
I'll ask you to put that down,
if you don't mind.
I thought we were gonna
shoot pigs.
You watch that gun or you'll end up
shooting yourself in the foot.
Wouldn't want
to have to leave you here.
A soldier never
leaves a man behind.
You'd make a good soldier, Tom.
Is that right?
Code of honor?
You ever do it, Henry?
You ever leave a man behind?
Jimmy's mate back home.
Gut wound.
Nasty way to go.
Boers half an hour behind us.
What did you do?
I made it so that
he wouldn't suffer
more than he had to.
Terrible thing.
You don't understand
the meaning of "necessary"
till you've been in a war.
But it was the right thing to do.
Always do the right thing, do you?
I do what's necessary.
We'll sit down together one day,
you and I,
and I'll tell you some stories.
Pigs.
You do it.
He's fine.
- Go on.
- No!
Tom!
Whoa!
Why don't you listen to me?
What he hell's
the matter with you?
Huh?
Where is it?
Just here.
Show me.
It's inside them.
Here.
You look after that lot
while I go get this tested.
Who's to say
I won't just run away with it?
Suit yourself.
There's plenty more
where that came from.
- I can't.
- Of course you can.
What's the problem, eh?
It's what you want, isn't it?
I have to make damper.
Sarah, wait up.
Let me think.
I need to think.
It's my gold.
It's here, and I can do
what I want with it.
We can do what we want with it.
Sarah.
Sarah.
You're looking well, son.
I'm feeling a lot better.
Thanks.
Good.
You'll be on your way
by morning, then.
Tom.
What are you doing?
Dad!
I think it's time
for you all to go.
Just follow the directions
I told you. You'll be fine.
I'd like to thank you
and your family
for your hospitality.
You're not going after them?
You can't let them go, dad.
I'll make my own decisions.
Thank you.
This is our future.
- This?
- I'm your father.
What are we going to do, dad?
What are you going to do?
Whoo.
This ain't it.
It's back there.
That's it.
It's a bloody dead end.
I don't want trouble, Henry.
When this is done,
you'll head straight that way.
It'll take you past the river
on the high ground.
I just want what he's got,
and then I'll be on my way.
What are you on about?
I need it, Henry,
more than he does,
more than you do.
What do you need?
God brought you here.
It's his will.
I need it for my family.
Jimmy,
give him your gold.
What gold?
Jimmy!
You mongrel bastards.
You're leaving.
What?
You're gonna go and leave.
Everything's gonna be
all right now, Tom.
I promise.
I heard you
with Jimmy.
What happened?
Where are they?
Where have you been?
We should never
have let them go.
Some things are out
of our hands.
Just gather what you need.
Get the old trunk
out of the stable.
Where are we going?
- Are we leaving?
- Tom, we have to fix the cart.
We're not going.
Well, what's happening?
Do as I say!
I don't want to go!
We have to go.
We're not going,
are we?
Tom.
You have to trust me.
We're just taking it with us.
You can do that.
It's in your heart.
I'm sorry.
God.
Come on.
There isn't much time.
No.
If you can't do it,
I will!
What do you mean,
we don't have much time?
Get the trunk.
Sarah.
The mallet in there?
Of course not.
You look terrible.
Go and fetch your brother.
Quickly.
Go!
We need to go!
That's right.
Tom!
Tom, stop it!
Stop it, Tom!
Tom, stop it!
Hurry.
Your father took something
that belongs to me.
He was doing
what he thought was best
for the family.
But he was wrong.
I want you to help me
to put things right again.
You understand what I'm saying,
don't you, Tom?
Where's Jimmy?
Somebody here to see you.
I'm sure you'll remember
everything by morning, Nat.
Yeah, Jimmy was a good kid.
Sharp as a bag of wet mice
but a good lad.
Tom!
Carver, god rest him.
Always said there's got
to be a balance.
There's a balance.
When things get out of balance,
you got to balance it up again.
Very fair man, Carver.
Pragmatic.
Where is he?
Your father shot him, Tom.
He shot Carver,
and he shot poor little Jimmy.
How?
I'm sorry?
How?
How did he shoot him?
With his gun, Tom.
With the family gun.
I don't believe you.
No need for that, son.
You want respect
for your elders.
And then he must have
come back here,
and he was probably nervous, right?
And then he'd have
gone outside to the stable
or the shed.
He had something with him,
a bag, maybe.
Was it a bag?
Sarah!
I don't know.
Nice spot of breakfast
for you, Nat.
Suppose we should get
some chores done.
Plenty to do on a farm.
How long are you going
to be staying here?
This old thing still play?
No.
Dad took all the wire out
to make traps.
He's just stupid, Nat.
I hate him.
Don't speak that way
about your father, Sarah.
Let's get these chores done.
Can't believe
you were spying on us.
What did you hear?
You didn't hear anything.
You ain't say anything, Tom.
You can't say anything to him.
He'll kill us all.
Do you understand?
"For this, to me,
is what new Australia means."
"To the landless,
to the homeless,
to those who long to be manly,
to be true,
to be what men should be."
Eh...
We need to do something
about the dog.
I'll deal with it.
I can do it.
I'll do it.
I'm not going anywhere.
Tom will stay here with me.
Get what you can, Tom.
It'll be a cold night.
Tom.
You know,
wouldn't take much to get
this place on its feet again.
They'll tell you the price of our
nationhood is blood and tears.
Now, I'm telling you
it's not gonna be ours
much longer.
I've seen it in South Africa.
Just a game to the empire.
Fighting some
other bastard's war.
Near the end of it last year,
we got orders to go through
and burn all the boer farms,
round up all the women and kids
and stick them in these camps
like cattle.
I remember the first one
we burned down,
me, Carver, and little Jimmy.
Little cabin,
smoke coming out of the chimney.
The woman, the wife,
hanging out the washing
as she saw us riding in.
Grabbed the kids
and pulled them inside.
Of course,
that wasn't gonna help.
You think there are things
you won't do,
things you just can't do,
and there's not.
There's nothing you won't do
if the time is right.
And we rode in
and yelled at them to come out.
And bloody Jimmy gets up
and torches the roof.
Went up like straw.
And it was Carver who ran in
and pulled 'em out,
coughing and screaming.
I don't know.
We shot all the animals
and burned everything.
Dragged the woman and the kids
behind us on a rope as we left.
Land didn't care.
Land just let it happen.
Place came, place went.
Land just watched it
come and go.
You know, the other day,
up on the mountain,
out there alone,
I stopped and listened
like you said,
listened to the land,
and it spoke, Nat.
It told me what it told you.
It said,
"It's all right to stay."
I just want you to know
you can rely on me.
I'll take care
of them for you...
Treat them like my own family.
Jesus.
Jesus Christ.
Where's your damn sister?
Sarah!
Run inside!
I got no quarrel with you.
I just got to leave him
some things, love.
Your friend said you were dead.
Well, he was wrong.
Your father's handiwork.
I'm sure he had a good reason.
Girl, you got no idea
what goes on in a man's head.
Our dog.
Planning on getting
your hands dirty?
A pretty little maid
with your nose in the air.
Think you're better than
the rest of us, don't you?
I believe there's a marked
difference between you and I.
Bury it.
No.
I want to see you get
your hands in the earth.
I've seen this, Nat.
It's lockjaw.
Bad way to go.
Really nasty.
I reckon you got a day, tops.
You can't save yourself,
but you can save your kids.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Where is it?
Stop it!
What?
Where's the rest of it, Nat?
Where is it, Tom?
Where's what?
You know what I'm talking about.
So your friend just
left you there to die, did he?
That ain't your concern.
He'll get his.
So much for promises.
And what on earth
did Jimmy promise you then, eh?
Share of that gold of his?
That'd be right.
Saw him do the same thing
up the gold fields.
Got us in a heap of shit.
It's why we left.
Our cock-happy Jimmy,
dipping his wick
in the governor's little girl.
Couldn't have been more than 15.
You're lying.
Governor's bloke
knifed the little bastard.
Got him right here.
That's right.
Get an eyeful, did you?
Promise you the world, did he?
So did he get it?
You don't know.
You don't...
did you give it up?
How bloody romantic.
Why?
Do you think
you were even worth a chance?
That's it, isn't it?
You actually thought it.
You're so stupid!
Look at you!
You've got nothing!
You follow your friend around
like some lost sheep!
- Shut your mouth.
- What is it?
Was he looking after you?
Was he your daddy?
Shut your damn mouth!
Is that it?
Missing daddy, are you?
Missing home?
Missing your stupid brothers?
I don't like a liar, Tom.
If I find it in here, you know
what'll happen, don't you?
I'm not a liar!
You lied!
My dad didn't hurt anyone!
We only had two shells, and I shot
them when we were hunting pigs.
I'm not here to harm you
or your family, son.
I'm here to help you
and protect you.
Where's Jimmy?
I've told you.
A soldier never
leaves a man behind.
You'll understand in time, son.
It's just the way of the world.
For this, to me,
is what new Australia means.
To the landless,
the homeless...
Tom.
To those who long to be manly,
to be true,
to be what men should be.
Stop it, Tom!
Come to work as free men
for each other.
This isn't a bloody game!
Whatever it is,
I don't want it!
I don't want what you want!
I don't care if it's yours,
and I don't care
who Jimmy gives it to!
I don't want it.
Sarah.
The bloody dog!
What were you thinking,
you dumb bastard?
I've come for my father.
Here.
The future.
Your father's good as dead.
So are you.
Dad!
Dad!
No!
Dad.
-
- Dad!
Tom?
Tom.
Where are you going?
Where's your father?
Struth, what happened to you?
Money.
Listen, all right?
You find anything, Tom?
The ground right near you?
The river?
Got to look out for this lot.
They'd be all over you
if you did.
You want to keep quiet about it.
Bloody scavengers.
You've already been through
hard enough trouble as it is.
So did you?
You find the yellow stuff?
Mr. Connolly.
Thank you, Charlie.
Go on.
Help yourself.
I don't know
what's happening, Tom.
I hope your father's all right.
He's a good man.
Got belief.
A man's not a man
without conviction.
See all this?
All this industry going on here,
I made it happen.
This is our security.
You ever felt it, Tom?
The land?
Hmm?
There's been a rumor
going around the camp.
They say you, uh,
found some gold.
On the farm, was it?
If these buggers get it
in their head there's gold,
they'll be up and off,
and that'll be that.
You don't want that, Tom,
these bastards
helping themselves,
running all over your farm,
helping themselves
to what's yours.
Hmm?
If you've got nowhere
to go, son,
you can come and stay with me.
A boy needs a place to be,
something to be certain of.
Well, you ever think about it,
just let me know
when you're ready.
Take your time.
If it's not there, Tom,
you can tell me.
Is it true, Tom?
Is it true?
I'm just trying
to keep the dream alive, Tom.
That's all I'm doing.
You got a dream, son?
Yes.
And what is it?
Whoa. Whoa.
You all right, son?
