SHH !
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE PRESS,
IT IS MY PLEASURE
TO WELCOME YOU...
ON BEHALF OF INTERNATIONAL
COMPUTEL CORPORATION...
TO PROJECT TIMERIDER.
PROJECT TIMERIDER
IS THE 16th IN OUR SERIES...
OF EXPERIMENTS
IN TIME TRAVEL,
AND TODAY WILL BE
OUR FIRST EXPERIMENT
WITH A LIVE ANIMAL.
A LIVE FEMALE RHESUS MONKEY
NAMED ESTHER G.
THIS EXPERIMENT, ONCE AGAIN
UNDER THE DIRECTION OF
DR. SAMUEL STELLAR,
HOPES TO SEND ESTHER G.
BACK IN TIME TO THE YEAR 1862...
AND RETURN HER SAFELY.
BECAUSE OF THE SENSITIVE NATURE
OF THIS EXPERIMENT,
AND BECAUSE
INTERNATIONAL COMPUTEL...
IS NOT CONNECTED
WITH THE GOVERNMENT
IN ANY WAY,
THE LOCATION
OF THE PROJECT BUNKER...
AND THE LOCATION
OF THE SENDBACK PAD SITE
IS SECRET.
I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF YOU
FOR COMING TODAY...
AND TO WELCOME YOU
TO THE FASCINATING
AND WONDERFUL...
NEW WORLD OF TIME TRAVEL.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
I CAN'T SEE !
IT'S SWANN.
HOW CAN YOU TELL ?

HE CAN SURE RIDE A BIKE.
WELL, THAT'S SWANN.

IT'S SWANN.
SWANN COMING IN ?
MM-HMM.
I DON'T FIGURE IT, JESS.
YOU GUYS COULD HAVE MADE...
A LOT OF NICE BUCKS
ALL THESE YEARS
RIDING FOR A TEAM.

A GREAT RIDER, JESS.
HE'D WIN
IF HE COULD FINISH.
WHAT KIND OF CRACK
IS THAT ?
NO OFFENSE, JESS.
OH, JESS, YOU TURN

OH, WELL,

HEY, I PICKED UP SOME TIME.
HOW'S OUR TRANSMITTER ?
IT'S PRETTY HARD TO DANCE
WITHOUT MUSIC.
IT'S OKAY NOW.
I THINK I GOT IT FIXED.
HOW MANY DIFFERENT BIKES
DID YOU USE TO MAKE THIS ?
MADE ENTIRELY FROM
FARM ANIMALS, MR. EARL.
RUNS LIKE A ROCKET UP TO 60.
AT WHICH POINT, I PUNCH
THIS LITTLE BUTTON HERE,
THE WHOLE THING TURNS INTO
AN ADULT MOTEL.
YOU JUST GOTTA
GET SERIOUS.
WHY ?
OH.
OKAY, YOU'RE UP TWO NOW, LYLE,
AND SHE'LL CLIMB LIKE A GOAT.
SIXTY-FIVE IS TOP
WITH THOSE TEETH.
DON'T YOU SEIZE
THIS SUCKER.
I GOT TWO INCHES OF FOAM
BETWEEN THE CASING
AND THE TRANSMITTER.
THAT'LL STOP THE BREAKUP.
THIS PICKS UP

PROVIDING YOU DON'T
CRASH AND BURN.

WE COULD USE THAT MACHINE.
HUH ?
WHAT IN THE HELL--
REESE, YOU CRA--
GODDAMN, REESE !
PADRE, I HAVE NO MONEY

IT IS ONLY THROUGH SACRIFICE
THAT ONE CAN RECEIVE SALVATION.
SENORITA !  SENORITA !
KEEP THE BREAD.
PADRE.  LISTEN,
I WAS DOWN
AT THE SPRINGS.
THERE WAS A MAN THERE,
DRESSED LIKE
I'VE NEVER SEEN.
AND HE HAD A MACHINE,
A RIDING MACHINE.
REESE AND THE DORSETTS
RODE UP WHILE I WAS THERE.
THEY WERE AFRAID.
THEY STARTED FIRING AT HIM.
SO, THEN THIS MAN,
HE GOT ON THE MACHINE,
HE RODE IT AWAY
LIKE A HORSE.
REESE AND THE BOYS
WENT AFTER HIM, BUT...
THE MACHINE
WAS MUCH FASTER.
PORTER REESE.
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE ?

CLAIRE CYGNE.
LYLE.  LYLE SWANN.
CLAIRE,
I'M HERE BY MISTAKE.
I DON'T MEAN HARM,

TWO AMERICAN MARSHALLS
ARE HERE.  THEY'RE ASKING
FOR YOU BY NAME.
ONE WAS BEN POTTER.
DAMN !
BEN POTTER.  HMM.
HMM.
YOU'RE THE STRANGEST WOMAN
I'VE EVER MET.
BECAUSE I KNOW MY OWN MIND,
MR. SWANN ?
WHY DON'T YOU
CALL ME LYLE ?
I PREFER NOT TO.
WHO ARE YOU, HMM ?
WHERE YOU FROM ?
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?
I TOLD YOU,
I'M CLAIRE CYGNE.
I WAS BORN IN LOUISIANA.
MY FATHER WAS A PLANTER.
I HAD TWO BROTHERS
WHO TAUGHT ME TO SHOOT AND RIDE.
I WENT TO SCHOOL THERE.
THE CIVIL WAR CAME.
MY BROTHERS AND MY FATHER
WERE KILLED,
SO I LEFT
WITH MY MOTHER.
WE WENT TO NEW ORLEANS.
SHE DIED SOON AFTER.
LEFT ME WITH TWO CHOICES--
TO USE MY BODY OR MY GUN.
I CHOSE THE GUN
TO GET MONEY TO EAT.
THERE WAS SOME TROUBLE.
I HEARD OF THIS PLACE.
SO, I CAME HERE.
THE PADRE AND ME,
WE BUY THINGS FROM PEOPLE...
THAT ARE DIFFICULT
FOR THEM TO SELL ELSEWHERE,
THEN WE SELL THEM.
THE CIVIL WAR ?  MY GOD,
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE ?
CLAIRE, DO YOU REALIZE
HOW WEIRD EVERYTHING
YOU JUST SAID TO ME WAS ?
I MEAN, WHAT-WHAT-
WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS HAPPENING HERE ?
YOU RIDE THIS MACHINE,
MR. SWANN.
NO ONE'S EVER SEEN
THAT BEFORE.
IT'S YOU
WHO SHOULD BE EXPLAINING.
YEAH, WELL, UM--
I STARTED RIDING MOTORCROSS
RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.
YOU WENT TO SCHOOL ?
CAN YOU READ ?
SURE I CAN READ.
GOT ANY BOOKS ?
DO YOU MEAN
DO I HAVE ANY WITH ME ?
YES.
NO, CLAIRE, I DON'T
CARRY BOOKS WITH ME.
I HAVE THREE BOOKS.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THEM ?
SURE.
HAVE YOU READ MARK TWAIN ?
A LITTLE, IN SCHOOL.
DID A REPORT ON TOM SAWYER ONCE.
I HAVEN'T READ THAT ONE.
YOU HAVEN'T ?
THAT'S HIS MOST FAMOUS.
I ONLY HAVE THESE.
YOU CAN READ ?
READ THIS.
"WHAT MIGHT IT BE
THAT YOU'VE GOT IN THE BOX ?
"THEN, SMILEY SAYS,
SORT OF INDIFFERENT,
"'‘‘LIKE IT MIGHT BE A PARROT
OR IT MIGHT BE A CANARY MAYBE.
BUT IT AIN'T.
IT'S ONLY JUST A FROG.'"
?? ALL I WANNA DO IS DANCE
AND HAVE A GOOD TIME ??
????
"SO, THE FELLA TOOK THE BOX
AND PUT UP HIS $40 A LOAD
WITH SMILEY...
AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT."
MR. SWANN.
WHAT'S THIS ?
UH, IT WAS MY GREAT-GREAT--
I DON'T KNOW,
WAY BACK THERE SOMEPLACE,
GREAT-GRANDFATHER'S.
MY GRANDMOTHER
STOLE IT FROM HIM,
AS A REMINDER
OF ONE INCREDIBLE NIGHT
THEY HAD TOGETHER.
HE TOOK OFF,
AND SHE WENT TO L.A.
TO FIND HIM AND NEVER DID.
SHE STARTED
HER OWN BUSINESS.
NOBODY REMEMBERS WHAT.
AT LEAST THEY AIN'T SAYING.
AND BECAME THE GREAT MATRIARCH
OF THE SWANN CLAN.
SHE PASSED IT ON DOWN
TO HER GRANDDAUGHTER
AND ON LIKE THAT,
TILL MOM GAVE IT TO ME
WHEN I WAS 21.
ANYWAY, IT'S
SUPPOSED TO BRING ME LUCK.
DOES IT WORK ?
DOES IT EVER.
KISS ME AGAIN.
OH, QUINN,
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?
HE HAS TO LEAVE NOW.
THE MARSHALLS, REESE--
IT'S TOO MUCH TROUBLE.
THAT'S THE BEST THING
I'VE HEARD.
SO, THEN HE LEAVES.
I'M THROUGH WITH HIM.

WHERE'S MY BIKE ?
WHERE THE HELL'S MY BIKE ?
OH, EMIL !
BASTARDS !
HE'S ALIVE.

- WHERE THE HELL
ARE THESE COPS ?
NEVER MIND.
I'LL FIND THEM MYSELF.
I'LL CLIMB UP TOP.
YEAH.
WONDER WHO THE HELL HE IS.
I GOT A CLEAN SHOT.
WHAT'S HE CARRYING ?
CAN'T TELL.
MAYBE HE'S DANGEROUS.
- SHOULD I LET HIM COME ?
- CARRYING A SIDEARM ?
NOTHING BUT THAT THING
IN HIS HAND.
DON'T LOOK LIKE NO WEAPON.
OKAY, LET HIM COME.
YOU THE LAW ?
DAMN IT,
ARE YOU THE COP OR NOT ?
DON'T PRESS ME, BOY.
PADRE HERE SAYS
YOU WAS A MARSHALL.
IF YOU ARE, I NEED HELP.
IF NOT, JUST TELL ME.
BEN, I KNOW WE'RE ALONE,
EXCEPT FOR YOUR FRIEND.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE MYSELF.
I DON'T LIKE
HIS SMART MOUTH.
HEY, LOOK, I'M SORRY.
I LOST MY TEMPER.
BUT SOMEBODY
STOLE MY BIKE.
- HIS MACHINE.
- OKAY, MY MACHINE.
SOMEONE TOOK MY MACHINE.
WHY YOU TELLING THAT

MY GRANDMOTHER STOLE IT
FROM HIM AS A REMINDER...
OF ONE INCREDIBLE NIGHT
THEY HAD TOGETHER.
HE TOOK OFF, AND SHE WENT
TO L.A. TO FIND HIM,
BUT NEVER DID.
SHE STARTED HER OWN BUSINESS.
NOBODY REMEMBERS WHAT,
LEAST THEY AIN'T SAYING.
SHE BECAME THE GREAT MATRIARCH
OF THE SWANN CLAN.
ANYWAY, IT'S SUPPOSED TO
BRING ME LUCK.
