But that's not a problem at all.
Just a little misunderstanding
a farmer.
A man named Foster.
I had small problems in trying
buying
piece of land.
As you can see land
which already belong to the company
are marked in gray
and this piece is still green
land we are talking about.

- Yes?
- A telegram from Paradise City

- Onion and nothing more.
I never never knew his father.
- I'm sorry ..
- Why, you know?
Finally you get home father.
But what's that smell
strong onions.
To be honest I do not know.
The smell comes from me ..
.. comes only from me ..
If I could see was
this place before, Onion ..
Once this place
was a small paradise
and would have remained a small town
peaceful farmers.
Everything changed when they discovered
that the area is full of oil.
A handful of people took
control of the city.
Many fled the city,
and those who remained
died in mysterious circumstances.
Onion, what do you think of
oil industry?
- It's wonderful.
- What is beautiful?
What? Mind
if you repeat the question?
Forget it, eat, let's courage!
Eat as it cools.
It's under your plate.
True.
Miss Mary Ann,

I said standing.
Look, I am standing.
Return slowly!
****************************
Which of you fired?
- I.
- With that?
- Yes.
- Who threw the bombs?
Where do you steal?
I have not stolen. We make it.
So you will encounter neighbors?
Father trust

Your father?
Foster told me that not having children.
I am Cal. Caligola Foster
Nerone and he is my brother.
I am the Onion.
It's nice to meet you.
Nerone come to make peace.
Caligola and Nerone ...
Father knew how
you play?
Now you are convinced that the father
I sold your land?
Yes it's true. It's written and
father's signature.
- Your brother has doubts?
- He does not know how to read.
Listen guys, my father
sold this land two months ago.
And I made him promise
not to give it the petroleum industry.
I promise I will keep this.
Now that they killed
do not know where to go.
- Why are you sure you killed?
- Are safe and ready.
You do not have anyone to
take care of you? Any relative?
I have it on Nerone and Nerone
I have myself,
and on our land
we do not go.
Look What's up guys, I
I gave all my savings
your father in exchange for
land, you understand?
- $ 236.50, is not it?
- That's right
- These are?
- Yes, I even mine.
- I recognize by smell.
- Okay.
Take your money and your piece of the cart
and disappear.
No, that's not correct.
If planting fast
lost harvest onions.
And I have no money
fertilizer.
You should make a loan.
- And who gives a loan?
- Okay, so we associate.
You two put money

One hand washes the other ...
But we work together.
All right.
Of course he was assassinated.
Poor, was found dead
off a cliff, a few days ago.
A sheriff said the accident.
But I have seen body
He had signs of violence on the body
and the gap was far
the earth's.
What to look for him there?
And you suspect that you threw?
You can be sure that one
not been discarded.
And of course they are not evidence.
The fact is that since they started
to pump that shit black
happened a lot of accidents.
And all were people who refused
Petrus Lamb to sell his land.
For example, Armstrong
which remained ...
- But it happens, right?
- So, in the middle of the desert?
It's too much coincidence.

Exciting ... and spicy ..
And passionate ..
I was me, I would not allow
I swear .. I ..
I do not do stuff like that.
No, it is counterfeit ..
Seeing yourself
As you have skirmished

Onion, if you want to give you
one hand,
the whole town will be on your side.
- So you agree?
- It's true, you know.
Well .. I am pretty busy
sowing and is a lot of work.
Wait, what are you going to do?
I'm going to see what's up

No, there is only one way
the sheriff's tops,
by Lamb and his murderers.
We need to find a single proof
about their illegality.
A story we published in Gazeta and will
reach the ears of the governor.
- But you do not have any proof?
- No, all they found something
ended at the cemetery
Remember that learning.
- Then let's see how do.
- Almost dawn.
