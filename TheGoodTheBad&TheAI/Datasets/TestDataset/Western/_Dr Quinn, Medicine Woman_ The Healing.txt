Come on! Stay put now! Dr. Mike's
gonna make you feel better, I promise!
How many pennies did you
say he swallowed?
Seven! Is he gonna be alright?
He's gonna be fine.
Just give him some of
this castor oil tonight.
It comes with a money back guarantee.
- Oh my gosh!
- Get down!
- Where'd it come from?
- I don't know!
Don't turn your back on me, old man!
Come back here!
You coward! You afraid
to face me?
Turn around!
What for?
So's I can be the one
that shot Kid Cole.
I said turn around, old man!
Somebody get the sheriff.
There ain't no sheriff!
Then somebody better get a doctor.
You got your mind
set to draw on me...
Go ahead and draw.
Sorry, ma'am. Is he your feller?
No. As of now, he's my patient.
Sorry, ma'am. I made sure
not to hit no vital organs.
Well, I'm sure he appreciates that.
It's an honor to see you
shoot someone, Mr. Cole.
No honor to it.
My cousin Leonard saw you
shoot a fella in Juarez.
Never been to Juarez.
Somebody help me bring him in.
Never met no lady doctor.
Then we're even, Mr. Cole. I
never met a gunfighter.
Stand up, boy.
How much I owe ya?
Would've been cheaper
to bury him.
He may still have that opportunity,
Mr. Cole. He's very weak.
Excuse me, ma'am, but I
don't wish any man's death.
Then why did you become
a gunfighter?
Wasn't by choice. I killed a man
in Texas a long time ago.
He had a reputation for being
fast so...I got one too.
Then people started coming after me.
How's the air around here?
Good for consumption.
How'd you know that?
I recognize the cough.
Here. This should help some.
The doctor in St. Louis said it
wasn't so bad.
Said if I'd settle down, take it
easy that...I should be okay.
Sounds like good advice.
Thanks.
This seems like a nice town.
Peaceful-like.
And you can't beat the view.
I know what it's like to
be new in town, Ingrid.
You're the first girl Matthew's
ever brought to supper.
Colleen!
It's time we got to know
each other better.
Where's Brian?
He said he was too excited to eat.
He's going hunting with Sully tomorrow.
He's got ants in his pants.
Yes, Matthew.
Where are you from in Sweden, Ingrid?
Stockholm.
Do please tell us about it.
I hear it's lovely.
Matthew -- the blessing.
Dear Lord, please bless the
food that is in front of us
and please bless us and our
guest. Amen.
Amen.
So, I understand you and Matthew
met at the church.
He's spoken of you...
a great deal since then.
Wait.
Are you alright?
Drink this.
I'm so sorry.
I eat too fast.
I'm sure that's what it was.
Let's go back to the table.
What happened? Is she okay?
She's malnourished, Matthew.
Her stomach reacted to the fact
that she hasn't been eating.
She's starving?
Yeah.
Just eat slowly.
- That oughta be enough.
- Thanks for the job, Miss Olive.
Well, now, a young man could use
a little change in his pocket.
We'll settle up when you get done.
You'll be back by dark?
- Close to it.
- Olive!
I got something for ya.
Excuse, please.
What can I do for you?
I look work. You got?
With half the mines closed, there
a lot of you boys looking.
I strong. Work hard.
I'm sorry. We can't help you.
You know I'm even gonna have
to close down store credit.
We don't want 'em here anyway.
In case you get hungry, I
made you a little something.
Thanks.
Go on! Get outta here!
Will you look at that! They're doing
it again! I'm getting my gun!
Loren!
Loren!
Go on, git! I told you to
stay away from here!
Loren!
Alright!
Alright, now you boys go on.
My garbage is for my hogs!
It's not theirs to take.
Here. Take it. Go on!
Olive!
What's wrong with it?
Looks like somebody shot her.
It's alright. It's alright.
What's that?!
I'm asking the deer's permission
to take her earth life.
No! She doesn't give her
permission! She's just hurt!
She's in pain. I can't let her
stay that way, Brian.
Cheyenne say if you inhale
the deer's last breath
you can keep her spirit alive.
Go on.
No, I don't want to.
She's not gonna live, Brian. She
can't run. Some coyote is --
Mom can fix her! She fixed my leg
and it's as good as new!
- Brian...
- Put her breath back!
Give her back her spirit.
Please, Sully.
Hello, Ingrid. I had to see you again.
You alright?
So sorry for the dinner.
Don't worry about that.
I'm just worried about you.
Thank you for worry.
My brother - he come with my
sisters from North Dakota.
Now that our father is gone. It's
good that we are come one place.
Here. Brought this for you.
-
- Jon says he take care of us.
Oh.
But he say he work for.
Miss Olive's got me mending fences.
Work. You interested?
Ja.
Ja.
Thank you.
Mom! Can you fix it?
Fix what?
Found him in the woods like this.
Can you fix her, Ma?
I can try.
Thanks, Ma.
Get my medical bag.
I'll do what I can.
You shouldn't have told him you
could fix it. You're asking for trouble.
You're the one who brought trouble
back here. He can talk you into anything!
What should we name it?
Is Sully your first name?
No.
Well, what is?
It's not a good name
for a deer.
Come on. I promise I won't laugh.
Trust me. It's not even a
good name for a man.
Please.
Byron.
What?
Byron!
Byron?!
Hey, Byron.
- Water?
- Ja.
You like Ingrid, ja?
Ja.
Yeah!
She's nice.
Ja.
- Here.
- Thank. For my sisters -- eat.
So many! For one person.
One cow. One cow would
feed you all.
Ja.
Got something to show ya.
- A wolf do that?
- No, that wasn't a wolf!
That cow's been butchered!
Who the heck --
- Immigrants.
- Now, Loren...
I'll get my gun.
We can't be sure it was them!
Aw, who are you kidding? We
both saw those scroungers!
Cattle hustling is a serious offense!
And not something you can let
somebody get away with.
How old are you? Seven? Eight?
Ten.
What's going on here?!
There!
- Go get that fella! Get him!
- Somebody killed one of Olive's cows.
Here's your man!
Found this in his tent.
String him up!
Hold on a minute here!
You can't just hang a person!
Yeah? Watch us!
Somebody get a rope!
No! No! Please, no!
Where are the children?
Olive! You've gotta stop them!
I can't!
Just get inside!
Move aside, Reverend!
He's a child!
He's a cow thief!
He's a boy who's asked for sanctuary
in the Lord's house and he's gonna get it.
He's gonna meet the Lord alright,
just as soon as he's jerked up to Jesus!
You can't kill a man for trying
to feed his family!
Yeah?
Reverend, you'd better step aside.
I'm sorry, Olive.
If you want me to move, you're
gonna have to make me move!
Me too!
Me too!
Go home!
We'll be back.
You can't keep him in there forever.
Peaceful little town, huh?
What happened?
They say he stole a cow.
He's lucky the bullet
went right through.
It's Sully.
I heard you had a little trouble.
I think we should wire Denver
for a Marshal.
For one stolen cow? They'd sooner
come out for a toothache.
What we need is a sheriff.
You're absolutely right. We
should look into getting one.
And how're you gonna pay
for the sheriff?
Well, I suppose we could
take up a collection.
That's a good idea. Should we
put out an advertisement?
I guess we should.
What, you're going now?!
Those people are ready to hang him!
No! No, please stay with him.
They might come back for him.
Hey, doc! Got some advice for you. You
best watch your step, you hear?
You best watch yours, you hear?
Thank you, Mr. Cole.
My pleasure, ma'am. You know I
don't like poor manners.
- Horace, I'd like to place an ad.
- Yes, ma'am.
And I want you to make sure it's
posted throughout the territory.
What'd you like it to say?
Help wanted - sheriff. Must be of strong
moral fiber, have knowledge of the law.
There go most of your
candidates right there.
I don't suppose you'd be
interested in the job?
I'm retired.
So I see.
Good day, Horace.
Good day, Mr. Cole.
Ma'am.
It's dangerous bringing her here.
Ingrid...
I had to.
I'll watch the front.
- You gotta let me tell them it was my idea.
-
No.
It's not for you to take
all the blame.
Jon says they take you and then no one
left to take care of sisters. You help.
He ask promise. Promise
you no tell.
I don't feel right about this.
-
- Promise.
Promise.
What are your qualifications then, sir?
Let's see now. Well, I've rode with the
Younger gang and the James gang.
Oh, I rode with the Dalton gang
for a spell, too.
So if any of those showed up in town and
caused a ruckus, I'd recognize 'em right off.
And you, sir?
I got my own gun. Would I get
to wear a badge?
My qualifications?
I've killed me 12 men already.
I ain't afraid to use force
if I have to.
So, say someone was accused of
disturbing the peace?
How would you handle that?
I reckon I'd have to shoot 'em.
If someone stole a piece of candy out
of a store, what would you do then?
I'd have to shoot him too.
Gentlemen, prepare to fire.
Ready!
Fire!
Shootings fine be accuracy is finer.
Looks like the only way
I'm gonna have me
a quiet, peaceful town is
to make me one.
I'm surprised you'd be interested
in such a position.
Well, truth be told, all I
really wanted to do
was find a quiet place to
put out a few rose bushes.
Maybe break up a saloon fight
once in a while...
Mr. Cole, would you excuse us
just for a moment?
Yes, ma'am.
Well, thank you all for
showing up.
The committee has
reached a final decision
And we're going to hire Mr. Cole.
Sorry, fellas.
We'd like you to start immediately.
By moving the boy to the
safety of the jail.
What's the salary?
Say, uh...2 bits a day?
Make that 4 bits a day
and we got a deal.
Then we're agreed, Mr. Cole.
Ah, just one thing else.
You ain't gonna be my
boss, are you?
Hold on there, son.
You get out of here.
Where'd you learn to
fight, Bradford?
You sure you're alright?
Come over here. I've
got something for you.
Here. Take this.
It's for your people.
Come on, son. Thanks, ma'am.
I'll take care of it.
They want food, they ought
to hunt for it.
Just like everybody else.
They're miners and farmers.
They don't know how to hunt.
Besides, they don't own any guns.
Are you gonna pay
for their guns?
Nobody asked them to come here.
Nobody asked any of us
to come here.
Why were they beating
up on that boy?
He do something wrong?
Some people don't like other people
because of where they come from.
There's something I gotta tell you.
What is it?
Tell them to go back
to where they came from!
Immigrant lovers!
Matthew, the fire!
Matthew, no!
I was with Jon.
It was my idea to kill the cow.
I helped him slaughter it
and bring it back.
I'm as guilty as he is.
How could you, Matthew?
How could you steal that cow?!
The town blames the immigrants
and now they're ready
to hang a boy!
You'd have done the same
thing if we were hungry.
These people are starving. I
just thought I could help.
Why did you wait until
now to tell me?
Because Jon made me promise.
It was wrong of Jon to make
you make a promise like that.
If anything happens to Jon
his sisters got no one to
look after them.
I can't stand the thought of
her going hungry!
- If I can get Miss Olive to listen...
- No!
- I can explain --
- No!
No, you let me handle this.
I'll offer to pay for the cow.
And you'll get a job to
earn the money.
Here's the money for the cow.
Take it.
I will not.
Why not? Isn't it enough?
There's enough there for 2 cows.
Then take it!
I can't!
It weren't you that stole it.
- What if it was?
- Matthew!
You wouldn't do something like that.
But if I did?
Then we'd have to hang
you too. Wouldn't we?
That's the only way to keep
order around here.
No exceptions to the law.
And what law are you referring to?
I'm referring to the law of
the land out here.
This ain't Boston, you know.
We're doing what needs to be done.
If you hang that boy
it's going to be murder -- not justice.
No! Pup pup!
No! Pup pup!
Brian?
Brian!
Brian! Push harder, Brian!
Push, Brian.
Oh, no!
I told you something like this
was gonna happen, didn't I?
She won't do it again!
Yes, she will!
She's a wild animal! You can't
control her like a dog!
I promise! I'll take care of her!
I'm sorry, Brian.
But that deer has got to go
back to where she came from.
She doesn't belong here.
You can give me a spanking if
you want, but please...
let me keep her!
You must keep her tied out
there, you hear me?
Yes, ma'am.
What do you think you're doing?!
Did you see what they're doing?
Yes, ma'am.
They're getting ready to
set fire to that!
Sorry, ma'am. There's no law
against string up a dummy.
You're not going to do
anything about it?!
Nope.
Then I will!
Come on, ma'am. Come on, now.
Tell them to take it down!
I can't do that.
They don't plan to wait on a trial!
They're going to hang him!
Little lady, you got my word.
There's going to be a trial.
It's just them boys are
pretty sure of the verdict.
A bag of beans...
And a couple of candies
for the little ones.
That's, uh, 1 dollar and 25.
Please put it on my account, Mr. Bray.
You account's been closed.
I've always paid you on
time, have I not?
My children are hungry.
Here. I have 50 cents.
I'll get you the rest.
You've got no credit here!
Hey, you!
Stop right there!
Stop him! He's stealing this! Get him!
They think they can take
whatever they want!
Let's go, Jake!
What are you waiting for?!
It all started with that cow thief!
Let's go!
Don't make me shoot you, boys.
You ain't getting more than one
of us before we get you.
Let's go!
You're the sheriff!
Nothing I can do, ma'am.
We're outgunned.
You can stop this!
It ain't just one cow. One cow
will turn into a dozen,
And a dozen will turn into a whole herd!
Where do you draw the line?!
This here's a trial --
And the verdict is guilty!
Yeah!
No! Listen to me!
It's not your affair!
May God have mercy on
your sorry soul.
I know I'm new in town
but it would've been nice to
have been invited to your party.
Bring him down, now.
The judge is coming tomorrow.
There's gonna be a trial.
Wrap it up. Go home!
All of you!
Go home!
So when will the judge be arriving?
He ain't!
I just got word he can't come. Something
about a double murder up in Boulder.
He said you should do it.
He made you something called a proxy.
That means he's appointed you
his official representative.
Now, hold on! I ain't no judge!
You are now.
You ever been through a trial?
Yes, ma'am, but I ain't never
been on this side of the law.
You don't steal a man's horse,
his cattle, his water, or his wife.
And you don't shoot a man in the back.
You do any of those
things -- you get hung.
Everybody knows that.
Hey, remember last year when
Franklin dug that illegal well?
He didn't argue none
when we hung him.
Well, he didn't have that much choice
then, did he? Some of us argued plenty.
What are we fooling around for?
He already said he did it!
Yeah!
As official judge, I wanna hear
both sides of this story.
Oh, you heard from everyone what happened!
I haven't heard from the
fella on trial.
He gets to speak his peace.
The rules say so?
Ladies and gentlemen...
I did wrong.
What you don't know...
how it is to lose your...
Hope.
How it is to lose your hope...
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.
Sit back down, son.
Anybody else got something to say?
Let's hang him!
Yeah!
Wait!
I got something to say!
No!
I helped Jon kill the cow!
No!
And I helped him bring
it back to town!
If you're gonna hang someone, hang me!
I don't know if anyone
will listen to me.
My views aren't always
the most popular.
But I do wish you'd listen to Matthew.
He and Jon stole a cow.
They know what they did was wrong.
But they did it because someone
they both cared for...
was starving!
I don't know what it's
like to be hungry.
So hungry, I'd steal.
I hope I never know.
If that day came,
I'd hope that my friends
and family would...
would see me in need and help me.
I've come to love this town.
And the people in it.
I want it to be a good,
safe place for my children.
And what we're deciding today is what
kind of place this town will be.
A place where we all look
out for ourselves?
Or a place where we all
look out for one another?
And that means all of us!
Whether we've been here for 10 years
One year.
Or 1 month.
Whether we're from Ireland
or Sweden...or Boston.
Mighty nice speech, Dr. Mike.
Anybody got anything else to say?
I got something to say.
I'm dropping the charges.
What?!
You can't do that!
Can't I?
If she brought them up,
she can sure drop them.
It's all over. You're free to go.
I always wanted to say that!
Hold on there, boys.
Now, you're gonna work off that cow.
I wanna see you at the ranch at
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, Olive.
You'd make a very fine lawyer.
Could I have a word with you?
Now, don't get me wrong, Dr. Quinn,
You got a lovely little town here.
But I'm real sorry. I just can't stay.
You're quitting?
It hasn't even been a week!
I may not be a gunslinger, but
I sure ain't no lawman, either.
Guess I'm gonna have to learn me a trade.
Maybe I oughta go to medical school.
So long, ma'am.
Matthew.
Brian...
You remember what I told
you when we were hunting?
That the Cheyenne believe that
a wild animal should be free?
We should only take what we
need for food. Remember that?
You think this deer's going to
be happy here like this?
For the rest of its life? No freedom to
run and play?
Be with its family?
There. Now you have my spirit.
