: We will divide
the army into multiple divisions
to pursue and destroy what's
left of the rebel army.
I have vital news. Go.
What happened, boy?
Comanche.
Comanches.
Ahh!
: This is
not the work of a ghost
This is the work of a man!
Come to relieve me, Tom?
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.
I can't think of one.
No!
You want to kill me?
: Gentlemen, what do you remember?
: Remember the Alamo!
I am waiting.
Hyah!

: Gentlemen, let's be clear.
I would choose death before betrayal.
But there is no deceit in death.
Betrayal is the willful slaughter of trust.
: Sir, we saw the field...
Your orders were not to engage.
Your insubordination
could have cost us dearly.
As of this moment,
you are now reassigned to second infantry.
- Sir...
- Now, get out of my sight.
Cavalry now belongs to Lamar.
Any objections?
We've bloodied them, Sam.
Perhaps we could regroup
for a counterattack.
General, they're on the defensive.
: I require
trust from my officers.
: Towards the Sisters here.
Take out the main barricade
and several points beyond.
Line of infantry 1,000 yards wide.
First Regiment here.
Baker's rifles here.
Sherman's regiment on the flank.
: Well, I vote we receive an attack.
: It's not up for a vote, Mosley.
Besides,
that's exactly what Santa
Anna thinks we'll do.
Now, you might reconsider.
We ought not to leave
the security of the woods.
: Where are the war dogs now?
: Colonel Lamar,
I want your cavalry on the right.
Colonel Seguin and his
Tejanos will man the rearguard.
: No. Unacceptable.
Understand, Juan, the courage
of you and your men is
not in question here.
There is such a deep-rooted
hatred towards Mexicans
that I fear your men may have to duck
more than Santanista bullets.
The killing may become indiscriminate.
The blood of our comrades
has earned us a place
alongside you, General.
My company insists on a frontline attack,
come what may.
: We'll need a way
to distinguish your Tejanos
from Mexican soldiers.
We'll wear...
goose feathers
as long as we can sink our teeth
into Santa Anna's neck.
I may have something else.
Let's use these instead.
_
: Goll dang.
General Cos.
Deaf. Deaf!
Mexican reinforcements.
Best tell Houston.
: They must've
been marching all night.
: They got to be tuckered.
Best get before they see us.
Yep.
- Houston!
- Fuego!
They see us.
Run!
Excuse me, Señor Presidente.
General Cos' troops are all present
and accounted for.
But exhausted from a long march.
They've been up all night.
So have I.
Your Excellency,
we should attack now.
No.
Houston wants us to attack
so he can cut us down
from the cover of those trees.
So we'll wait until
Filisola and Urrea arrive?
Yes, with overwhelming number,
we can surround them.
See?
Houston will have nowhere to run.
Feed the men in shifts and let them rest.
Yes, sir.
Houston's skirmish yesterday
made no tactical sense.
I don't like it.
: General, we take that bridge,
you won't have to worry about
Santa Anna's reinforcements no more.
You'll be all by your lonesome.
You know I can't afford
to spare you even one extra man.
Forgive me, but destroying that bridge
will cut off our retreat as well.
: That's a good point.
Then we'd better not lose.
Position a crack squadron of dragoons
to protect Vince's Bridge at all costs.
It's our lifeline.
: Would it not be
better to abandon this position
until we can rejoin all our armies
and then pursue Houston on the offensive?
Why?
We have him!
Here and now.
Let his men sweat it out
while our soldiers rest.
: Yes, sir.
What can I do to comfort you, Antonio?
Knowles, get your slack ass up.
Morning, sweet pea.
Princess is up.
- Lazy old bitty.
- Come on, now.
Saddled up your horse for you.
: Come on out. There she is.
- Come on, sweet pea.
- Aww, looking pretty.
: Hey, girl.
: All right. That's enough.
It's time.
Knowles, mount up.
I don't know what's ailing you, son,
but whatever it is,
you leave it here at camp.
Kick up!
: The general
is not to be disturbed.
Come no further.
: What's he doing? Sleeping?
: Step away. Step away.
: He's awake for 56 days straight;
Now he sleeps?
: If he truly wanted to attack,
it should've been at first light.
The weather has been fickle.
It's in our favor now.
Who the hell is this?
: Lorca.
Where's General Houston?
: State your business.
Saith Jehovah, "Raise your sword
"with abandon and outrage
till the rivers run
red with heathen blood."
Amen.
If you've come to bear arms with us,
then I'll assign you to
Colonel Lamar's cavalry.
I'll be assigned no man.
Be clear on that.
But we'll kill Mexicans alongside you
till every brown breathing
bastard lies dead.
Fair enough.
When I'm ready to attack,
I'll give you a sign.
Watch for it.
"Vengeance is mine," saith the Lord.
Sam, you can't trust that loco.
This day, I'd ally with the devil himself.
I think you just did.
Oh.
Tsk.
: Mind the horses.
All right. All right. All right.
- Knowles, damn it.
- Listen ti me.
Ain't you supposed to be with the horses?
I know. Just listen.
I was wondering, if we blow up the bridge,
how are we supposed to get back across it?
We don't.
You hear that?
Something's in the marsh.
: Halt! Hands in the air!
Stop right there, or I'll shoot!
-
- Identify yourself!
- We said stop!
- It's me!
It's me, Manuel Flores.
Cease fire! He's one of us.
Manuel, what news?
Santa Anna's army is resting.
His forces are tired.
Emily West says it's time to attack.
More reinforcements are coming.
And Miss West herself?
She said, "Tell General Houston
"it was right to wait,
but attack now."
Very well.
Sir.
_
: Easy.
-
-
: You were born
to live as free men.
One man took that freedom from you.
One man sent your sons and
brothers to unmarked graves,
your women and children
left homeless and afraid,
burnt your farmlands,
reduced your cherished
homesteads to ashes...
one man, a tyrant,
Santa Anna.
Today...
today we avenge our dead.
We honor our loved ones.
Today we are one.
We are all sons of Texas.
We give Texas our allegiance.
We give Texas our lives.
In the name of Texas,
ready your weapons and
unsheathe your swords,
and follow me to victory!
They're retreating.
So it seems.
: The cowards.
: Good. Easy. Good.
Come on. Keep it coming. Keep it coming.
Go on. Go on. We'll string the fuse.
That's the last one.
Go on. I'll fire it up.
Let's see. Let's see. Let's see.
: Tell 'em to play that
song,
Let me hear it.
Capitan!
: Trail arms forward.
Quietly, men.
Keep it quiet.
Fire cannon.
: Fire!
Remember the Alamo!
: Remember the Alamo!
Follow me!
Go!
Remember the Alamo!
Charge!
Remember Goliad!
: Remember the Alamo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
: Antonio!
I have waited to see
the look of defeat in your eyes.
You killed my brother at the Alamo.
-
- You killed Jupiter!
Hold the line!
Attention!
Attention!
Hold ranks!
: Form a line here!
And fire at will!
Follow me!
: Follow!
No retreat! No retreat!
Stand and fight!
Go now! Go back!
Go back!
Go back!
Back!
Go!
- No, no, no, no, no...
-
: Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
Ride up, boys!
Spread out!
Whoo!
Hiyah!
That's it. I'm out of here.
Kit!
Come on.
Come on, Kit.
Sit down right there, Kit. Get down.
Son of a bitch!
Get, damn it!
Take this.
I'm coming back for you.
Hey! Hey, get off him.
Get off.
Come on!
Mighty white of you, Flores.
Fight on, men! Follow me!
Hiyah!
: Remember Goliad!
Remember the Alamo!
Arm the cannon!
Move!
That's Houston.
Turn the cannon, quickly!
: Fight on, men!
Yah!
Fire!
Yah!
Houston!
Take my horse!
Rally your men.
Yah! Yah!
: Mexicans! Remember the Alamo!
Go.
Captain Karnes.
Colby.
I'm out of shot.
Stay put.
Surround him!
To hell with this.
Come on. Yah!
: That's their war secretary!
Surround him!
: That boy saved my life.
Damnedest thing I ever seen.
Rusk!
: Remember the Alamo!
Hiyah!
Juan! You're one of us.
I am a Tejano!
I am a Tejano.
I'll find Finisola!
You head west to Urrea!
: If Jesus Christ himself
came down from heaven today
and ordered me to stop killing heathens,
I would not do it!
I would not do it!
: Sam!
Tom!
It's just a scratch.
The enemy's been routed.
We have to stop the killing.
Get the men under control.
- Cease fire! Cease fire!
- Cease fire!
Cease fire!
: Boy, turn around!
We don't take any prisoners, soldier.
: Cease fire!
Cease fire!
: Cease fire!
- Mind your fire.
- Cease fire!
Cease fire.
They're surrendering.
Cease fire. Cease fire.
We surrender!
- No surrender.
- Stop this.
- We surrender.
- We surrender.
Remember Goliad? Remember Fannin?
Anderson, take these prisoners to...
: Your orders
are to take prisoners.
The general's orders are to take prisoners.
: We'll take them
just like the Mexicans did.
- Who is it?
- Give them room!
Coming through!
I thought we won.
: Those are prisoners, General.
: We did win, Sam.
: General Houston!
General, Texas is ours.
: An astounding victory, General.
: What's your report?
Around 700 Mexicans killed.
At least that many prisoners.
What about our men?
Only 9 dead and 33 wounded, sir.
: 34...
counting you.
And Deaf is unaccounted for.
: Deaf?
Well, rally the Rangers.
Find him.
Yes, sir.
: Has Santa Anna been captured?
We are hunting him, sir.
He must be taken alive. You hear me?
Without him, there's no victory.
We've won nothing.
: Keep searching, men!
: Down here!
Over here!
This way!
Mexicano!
Mexicano. Mexicano!
Benito?
Benito,
you are one of the keepers
of my champion birds.
Presidente?
- Si.
- Presidente.
My friends are all dead.
We lost.
We lost a lot of friends today.
: Put him down over there.
I thought you'd be hanging curtains
and darning your fiancé's socks by now.
I'm not going anywhere yet.
Drink this.
: I need to clean this.
Get me some more water.
Do you love him?
Gavin's a goodhearted man.
He's decent.
Daddy loved him, promised
me to him years ago.
Answer my damn question.
: Just get him some laudanum.
You don't want what I got to give, no way.
The next bullet that comes
my way might be my last.
Don't say such things.
You know, my whole life,
people have been telling
me what's good for me.
: Back over when you've got a minute.
You'd be a damn fool not to go with him.
No, you're the fool, Kit Acklin.
: Where am I?
Did they cut my leg off?
: No, but
your ankle was shattered.
If sepsis sets in,
you will die a slow, miserable death.
Any word from Emily?
: No.
We got to get you to New Orleans.
If not, should you fall unconscious,
I will have that leg off.
I'll take my chances in New Orleans.
Emily.
Am I dying, padre?
Si.
: Deaf.
Deaf!
: Oh-ho!
Well, chop my legs and call me Shorty.
Vern! Vern, ain't this swank?
Ain't this swank?
Close this thing.
Hey, take a look at this.
Take a look at this.
: One second.
General Santa Annabella herself.
Ooh, well, hello there.
Hello. Hello, there.
The spoils of war, son.
We grab what we can hold,
and we cut out of here tonight.
Yes, sir. Whoa, whoa, no.
I don't know.
Vern, Vern, hey, Vern.
You got to understand.
I'm a hero now.
I saved the war secretary's life.
I heard you tripped
over a bunch of Mexicans.
It...
Ha!
Eureka.
Holy shit.
: Surrender, Mexican,
or I'll kill you deader than last Tuesday.
On your knees. On your knees.
Are you alone?
Maybe.
Hands up.
Hands up!
God damn. We can't get it all now.
Got to come back before we head out.
-
-
Well, goodness gracious.
What is this?
It's the mother lode...
Santa Anna's treasure.
You snakes weren't gonna tell me about it?
Well, why should we?
We found it.
Lucky for me,
so did I.
: That there must
be El Presidente's tent.
: Cover this shit up. That's right.
- All right.
- Cover it up.
- All right.
- That's right.
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-whee!
Awful highfalutin.
Looks like this place done been looted.
We was just picking up
a few souvenirs, man.
Spoils of war and such.
Well, you know that looting
could get you court-martialed and shot.
-
- What, you mean...
even for a token or two
for our loyalty to Texas?
Listen up.
All this belongs to the Texas government.
So if you don't mind, I'll take...
- Captain, you all right?
- Son of a bitch.
: Damn.
Oh, lookee here.
Would you look at that?
Santa Anna must've buried that, right?
Must have.
All of it.
: Damn.
: Yeah!
How about that?
: Vive, El Presidente!
: Yeah!
: It's a tincture of opium, Sam,
for the pain.
Quart of warm whiskey
would work just as well.
General, you've got to see this.
He needs to rest.
I need fresh air.
Fetch my clothes.
Haul me up, Tom.
: By my count,
we have over 20,000 pieces
of silver and gold...
all of Santa Anna's
personal valuables, sir.
: General, we must give
these to the people of Tejas.
: Gentlemen, there is
no discussion on this matter.
Funds seized from the enemy
belong to the newly liberated Republic.
: Another group going in.
: It all goes to Texas.
Karnes, that soldier there.
Bring him to me.
: Sir.
Flores, fetch Colonel Almonte.
Yes, sir.
: Move!
- : Colonel Almonte...
- : Come on.
So you're a private.
Si, señor.
Colonel Almonte,
why do your men salute him?
Regretfully,
I do not know all my soldiers, sir.
That's too bad.
Private Pitt,
execute your prisoner.
: Yes, sir.
: No, private.
Put him up against a tree
so his brains don't splatter.
I am Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.
Wait. He's Santa Anna?
And I am Sam Houston.
El Presidente, General,
I cannot express
how glad I am to meet you.
I ask to be treated as a general should be
when made a prisoner of war.
Men!
We captured Santa Anna!
We must convene a tribunal and execute him.
: Death by firing squad!
: yeah!
Yeah!
The conqueror of the Napoleon of the West
can afford to be generous
to the vanquished, no?
You should have remembered that, sir,
at the Alamo.
At the Alamo, your defenders chose to die.
You offered them no alternative.
-
- Bastardo.
Juan...
This is war, sir,
and no one here is good or bad,
just winners
and losers.
I acted under the orders
from my government.
You are yourself the government.
That's damn right.
: Texas formed a
recognized government.
We are not pirates.
The rules of war applied.
General, why are we even
talking to this murderer?
He needs to swing.
Firing squad, here and now!
: Yeah!
: Do it!
- Yeah!
-
: There'll be no firing squad.
: We want blood!
: That cannot happen.
Alive, Santa Anna is of great value to us.
If we execute him,
he'll just be another dead soldier.
Let us take our reparations.
Open his war chest.
Gold to every man in my command.
Equal shares for all those
who risked their lives.
General Seguin, General Sherman,
show the men.
Divvy it up.
: Yes, sir.
General, we're taking him.
Retribution goes hand in hand
with victory.
Present your prisoner.
I will not.
All right, fine by me.
We end it all now.
My only reason for living
is to slay him.
Ride on out of here while you can.
Shut your mouth, boy.
Shoot me first.
You don't think I will?
Soldiers, ready arms!
Don't fool yourself.
Santa Anna will die!
It's just a matter
of how many of us he takes with him.
You understand me?
Charmaine.
Come here, girl.
Come here.
You saved me today.
Oh, sweet girl.
No.
Why'd you have to go do that for?
Why'd you do that?
I'm so sorry.
: I'm so sorry.
Come on. Let's get you off that leg.
Let's get you off that leg, okay?
You do me a favor.
You do me a favor.
You wait for me. You hear?
You wait for me.
You'll be seeing me real soon.
: Get every one of them!
Every one of them!
Hey, come on!
Come on!
No! He's just a child.
Nits make lice.
We're done killing women and children!
Then get out of here!
I aim to kill Mexicans,
and I ain't done yet.
- Go.
- All right.
Just go, man. Go.
Go!
Come on, man.
Give me the boy.
: Any word from Deaf?
: No, General.
And Miss West?
Nothing, sir.
Very well.
You wanted to keep me alive, no?
Once you are gone, these men will hang me.
Tell me something.
Your generals... will they retreat
once they're informed
you've been taken hostage?
No.
Their orders are to engage.
Then I recommend you rescind those orders.
So you want Texas
in exchange for my life, huh?
Sounds like a trade.
: Only President Burnett
can negotiate a treaty.
: Well, he
can't very well negotiate
if El Presidente here is dead.
Now, can he?
: I'll need them vials.
Kit,
are you sure you're fit to ride?
Hey, now, don't fuss.
In case I need tending to,
Doc Ewing's coming with the General.
I'll see you when I get back.
I certainly hope so...
if you don't get yourself killed.
: Sarah, you got
my medical bag packed up yet?
I'll be seeing you.
: Sarah!
Where you heading to, Vern?
War is over for me, Knowles.
I done my duty.
Had my fill of taking orders.
Might head on down to Victoria.
Mm.
You want to know my guess?
You and Gator are going after that bank.
Gator's so full of bunkum,
if he told me water was wet,
I'd have to poke my finger
in and feel for myself.
Kit didn't trust him.
You ought not to neither.
Well, I ain't robbing no bank.
I'm a hero now.
Got a reputation to uphold.
Well, if you want to ride
your hero ass along with me,
you're welcome.
Well...
no, thank you, my friend.
I reckon I'll just stay put.
Good luck with that shit.
Tell them boys I say adios.
All right.
You lily-livered weasel.
How in the hell am I supposed
to take this bank by myself?
Well, why don't you
recruit Karnes and Anderson?
: Tom, I want you
to ride on ahead to Burnett.
Formalize our agreement with Santa Anna.
Buckley and Seguin will
take charge of the army
while I'm away.
: You get that leg healed up, Sam.
Texas needs you.
You just gonna leave me behind, is that it?
Well, I'll be damned.
I'd about given up on you.
I had to lay Charmaine to rest.
: Partner, damn.
You look like something the cat dragged in
that the goat wouldn't eat.
Right here.
Let it out.
Let it on out.
: Private Pitt.
The man that captured Santa Anna
ought to make a damn good Ranger.
Your first assignment:
Take Captain Smith home to his wife.
Yes, sir.
Sorry to hear about Charmaine.
: Anybody fetch me a new mount yet?
: Get a wagon
and lay him down in back.
You're in no condition to go, Deaf.
What'd you say, Sam?
You need to look me in the eye.
I said you're not going.
And who's gonna look after
your old crippled ass?
Karnes will take command of the Rangers.
Just gonna throw me away.
Is that it?
Go home, old friend.
The Republic of Texas
is grateful for your service.
Go on.
: All right.
Colby, get him in the medical tent.
Got to get Houston to New Orleans
and Santa Anna to his peace talks.
You take care of yourself, Deaf.
: Let's move out.
: Sam.
Sam.
I'll tell you when I'm done.
Yah.
: You just had one, Sam.
That's quite enough.
Mmm!
You think you are a man of destiny,
but all I see
is President Jackson's puppet.
All I see is a man in a chicken coop.
I am defending my people
against pirates like you,
stealing our land.
History will sweep you
aside with a footnote.
Perhaps.
Better a footnote
than a whole book of abominations.
No difference with what
you did in San Jacinto.
We are men on opposite sides,
yet there is much we share.
A love of our countries,
a love of... other things.
A remarkable woman, Miss West.
An extraordinary woman,
especially in bed
when she's screaming with pleasure.
I hear women are quite skilled
at pretending that sort of thing.
"Oh, Antonio, yes, yes, more.
Give me more."
Give him another one, Doc.
He's wrestling with
what defeat tastes like.
Colonel Portilla's got Emily West.
Wants to trade her for Santa Anna.
A whore for a chief of state.
Portilla is losing his mind.
Give this back to him.
Flores.
Sir?
Yes, sir.
Anderson!
- Yeah.
- Get ready.
God is with us.
Ha!
Beads and whiskey
always worked for me before.
Whoa, whoa. Keep your head, mister.
Else you're liable to lose
it along with your scalp.
Everything's set.
I need my volunteers.
: Get out there, Phineas.
- You be a man.
- All right.
I can give you Clarence
and the other Negroes.
Best if I stay back
and watch over the children and womenfolk.
Bigfoot, let's meander.
Well, move it.
Must've hanged your president by now.
When I know that's true,
I'll use you for my men's amusement.
And where will you go?
Texas... they'll hang you for Goliad.
In Mexico, they'll shoot
you for San Jacinto.
-
-
-
-
Shh.
Now! Fire!
Fire. Fire!
Fire, boys. Fire!
Come here, boy. We did it!
- Whoo!
- We drove them off.
Everybody good over there?
: We done it!
I'll be damned.
It worked!
Slicker than snot on a doorknob!
: Blessed be the saints!
Saints, hell.
Thank Jack Hays.
Come in.
Come in!
Come on in.
-
-
That music,
is it for me?
You're famous, Sam.
Savior of Texas.
You've got to stay put.
You're gonna bust open your damn stitches.
People want to see me.
Help me.
Damn it.
Put your leg over here.
Consarn it, Sam,
you can't put any weight on that leg.
That's why I'm leaning on you.
I got him.
Thank you.
Thank you!
Give me your hat.
My hat? Why?
Thank you!
Sam.
Nurse!
That was my best hat.
Be careful.
: I need fresh air.
The wound will reopen.
What will you do when you're strong again?
Go back to Tennessee?
I came out with my husband and kids
to find a better life.
I got to stay.
Forbear, Don Antonio. Forbear.
Portilla will come to save us.
If I owned both hell and Texas,
I would rent Texas and live in hell.
: Mrs. Smith!
Mrs. Smith, we got your husband!
Captain Smith is here.
Please, give me a hand.
: We did it, darling.
Texas is ours.
Are you all right?
Come here.
Hey, hey, that's him, ain't it?
- Captain Smith?
- Yes, sir.
Captain Deaf Smith, fresh from San Jacinto.
War is won, mostly.
Splendid.
We managed to miss it
in search of a trinket.
Ain't a trinket.
Hell, if Texas does to us
what it did to him and Samuel,
we might ought to give California a shot.
Christ washed the feet of lepers.
Thank you for coming.
This is a special moment
in the life of my grandson.
Salute, Louis.
You remember me, mister?
Yes, ma'am.
Unfortunate what happened.
You sold us that place
knowing the Comanches
were running loose.
As I recall,
your husband inquired only
of the Mexican turmoil.
The subject of Indians never come up.
Carts!
What the hell are you doing out here?
I told you to get back in there
and finish that goddamn...
: Colby.
Hey!
Round up men for a posse.
We got a rescue mission.
Where is Deaf?
Over there.
Show the way.
: Can't go with you. I'm sorry.
Got my belly full of killing.
I'll shoe your horses and fix your tack
free of charge anytime you want.
: Erastus is done rangering.
Let him know peace in his final days.
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.
We're just here to look after
his well-being
and to pay our respects.
You think I don't see?
There is trouble somewhere.
You want men.
There's been a kidnapping.
Yeah, the lady who
helped us beat Santa Anna.
You found Emily West?
You get back in that bed.
I've got to take a country leak, woman,
unless you want to mop up this floor.
Bueno.
Deaf. This is...
Captain Smith, name's Jack Hays.
This here is Bigfoot Wallace.
It's a real honor to meet you, sir. I...
Are you the Tennessee
turned up and saved this town
from the Comanches?
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
That was nice work.
Thank you.
Hey, come on.
Deaf, we're... we're not here
to give you any trouble.
We... we don't want
to cause a commotion.
We just don't want to...
Though we could use your advice.
Please.
Advice.
Don't marry a woman that can whoop you.
She'll make you piss yourself.
Portilla's got her. Don't he?
That's right.
I think I remember seeing him ride off.
I figured she was dead.
Didn't tell nobody.
I'm gonna need a new mount.
: Done.
: Excuse me.
Deaf, no.
If you go out that door,
we know you ain't coming back.
Lupe, darling,
I am coughing blood and farting dust.
Now, I reckon I can die in that bed
watching all your caterwauling,
or I can die as I've tried my damnedest
to live all my days:
Like a man.
You done real good keeping
me around this long.
Can you do one more thing?
You mind fetching me my clothes?
Those look real good.
Mind your chores,
and you be a comfort to your ma, you hear?
Now, when you get older, well,
I'm gonna expect you
to account for yourself.
Texas is gonna need a
young lady like yourself.
All right?
I'm mighty proud of you.
There ain't words for how much I love you.
: Make way!
: Sam.
Your enemies are conspiring
against you as we speak.
: He and Houston
want to annex our Texas.
If you would accept this...
It must be used for good.
Your land is now forfiet
as well as the collateral...
You can't have Nate.
What about this one?
Shoo, shoo, in the kitchen.
Santa Anna's whore doesn't
eat with decent folk.
I very much like your house.
It would suit me.
They may have cleaned you up.
I know you.
What do we got to do to join
up with a ranger company?
And I suggest you finish
up your little party here
and come with us and get back home
and fix Texas before it's too late.
