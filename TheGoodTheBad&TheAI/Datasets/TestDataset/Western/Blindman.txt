Do you know a man
called Skunk?
Uh-huh.
Where does he sleep?
In the funeral parlor,
across the road.
Opposite the church.
And where's the church?
Over there.
Right behind you.
Point to it.
Does this church
have a tower?
Yes.
Is your priest rich?
Yes.
Good.
Then you have a bell.
-
-
-
-
Skunk?
Hey. Honey.
Limey!
What's going on
'round here?
It's the blind man.
Skunk.
I'm here, Blindman.
What do you want?
I want my 50 women.
You got my women
and I want 'em.
You're in the wrong town,
mister.
All I've got here
are two nice, young men.
-If you want them.
-
You forget,
I have a contract.
We're supposed
to deliver those women
to the miners
in Lost Creek, Texas.
The women are gone.
A guy called Domingo's
got them.
And where's this "Domingo"?
Mexico.
Mexico's
a big place, Skunk.
I don't know
this guy, Domingo.
We'll go there together.
You don't have to worry
about a thing.
He's a friend.
Show him the contract.
You know something, Skunk?
Every night,
I kneel down
and I say my prayers.
And every night...
I ask the good Lord...
"Lord...
who are my friends?"
And you know something,
Skunk?
Every night,
it's the same thing.
He don't answer.
Which way is it
to Mexico?
How are we going
to show you?
Just show the horse.
Well, boss,
what's this town like?
Another shit, huh?
I want a room.
What's wrong with you,
mister?
You deaf?
What are you doing?
-I light the lamp.
-I don't need it.
Do you need
anything else?
A whore.
Sí, señor.
Old or young?
What's the difference?
The old ones cost more.
The price of experience.
-Then get me a young one.
-Uh-huh.
-
-Come in.
Come here.
What's your name?
My name?
Margherita.
Listen, Margherita.
I need some information.
I'm looking for a man
called Domingo.
For a business deal.
How do I go
about finding him?
Shh. Quiet.
Don't scream.
I told you,
it's for a business deal.
I... I don't know nothing.
Nothing at all.
Please, let me go.
Just tell me
where he lives.
I don't know nothing.
I'll give you money,
Margherita.
Lots of money.
Are you the father
of Pilar?
Yes.
Well, I need
some information.
How do I find Domingo?
Where is Pilar?
She's inside.
Announce me, Pedro.
Pilar.
Pilar.
That Domingo?
His brother.
Candy.
You're a pig.
I'll remember that.
-
-Peace!
Peace, brothers.
There's enough hate
in this world.
What we got to do is try
to love one another.
Who is he?
Hey.
The guy is blind.
Blind?
Then give him a peso
and get him out.
No, no.
Wait a minute.
He has to earn it.
Hey, blind man.
Do you play the guitar?
No.
Can you sing?
No.
Then dance, blind man.
-
-
Well, all right.
I'll take you
to Domingo myself.
Look at me, little one.
What's the matter?
Aren't you happy?
We have a big fiesta here
tonight.
So you be happy.
Which one of these
does Candy take for himself?
He doesn't take any.
Why not?
Because he likes
the daughter of the gringo.
Where is he now?
In the ghost town.
You're like
a piece of wood.
You know?
Someday I am going
to build a fire under you.
Just to get
a little bit of warmth.
You are my woman.
Do you understand?
I will never
be your woman.
-
-
-
-
Domingo, amigo.
-My general.
-
Ah, Sweet Mama.
And it's good
to see you.
Of course, amigos.
The first choice
is yours.
-Thank you.
-Gracias.
-Thank you.
-
-
- This should be good.
Ah.
I salute your beauty,
Sweet Mama.
-Thank you, General.
-
And now, from Europe.
The most beautiful girls.
Domingo's house
is straight
in front of here.
Good.
Now, you wait here
for me, all right?
No! Please!
-
-
Stupid.
You'll never have any luck
with a woman.
Why not, General?
Domingo,
there is this man outside
who wants to talk to you.
Are you crazy?
Not now.
He says it's important.
Tell him to go to hell.
God damn,
that's a delicate thing.
All you have to do
is breathe on it.
Stand up.
Nobody invited you
to sit down.
Right.
You must be Domingo.
Never mind who I am.
I want my 50 women.
Huh.
Your 50 women?
Yes. My 50 women.
Why are they your women?
'Cause I have a contract.
What contract?
This one.
That a friend of yours
named Skunk and I signed.
We were supposed
to deliver those women
to 50 miners
in Lost Creek, Texas.
Who've already paid
for their trip
and asked for their hands
in marriage.
Skunk?
Oh, that Skunk.
He screwed you, huh?
Right.
But he said
you were friend
and that I could ask you
for the women.
He would have come along
with me, you see,
but he had
a little accident.
Well...
I can't read, you know?
But this looks like
a contract though, right?
So, I'll solve
this little problem.
Now you don't have
a contract.
Because I burn it.
Now let me give you
some good advice,
you Mexican pig.
You better burn me too.
Excuse me for just
one more minute, General.
You still don't have
the strength!
-My friend!
-
They're mine!
I am a patient man,
but I can only
take so much!
Now, with the compliments
of my heart,
give him a few pesos
and throw his ass
out of here!
And now, amigos,
we go and have our dinner,
-huh?
-Yeah.
-
-
The girls are ready now!
You can go in!
Go in!
Ah!
I want
to declare officially,
that Domingo is the finest
and most perfect host
in the whole state.
I second that!
I thank you
from my heart.
But the praise must go
to my sister,
who is the mistress
of this house.
Ah.
To Sweet Mama.
To Sweet Mama!
Your health, Señora.
-Good meal.
-My sister is very honored.
You make her very happy.
But I tell you something.
I know her.
And she would
be even more happy
if you hand over
the money for the women.
Hey, she keeps
the accounts for me.
Mm-hmm.
-She's an expert.
-Mm?
She learn it
from the priest.
Give it to him.
$50,000, as we agreed.
Who killed my men?
Who killed them?
-
-
I don't know.
I didn't see a thing.
Now, you do what I told you,
old man.
And now,
here are the delicate,
young girls
to warm your hearts
and your beds,
wherever your brave general
may take you.
-
-
More cigars.
More wine.
More women.
More everything.
Don't move, General.
Oh, no, General.
Dude!
You are worth
two million pesos
to me alive.
Clean up these bodies
and get rid of this mess!
-
-
I told you, don't move.
That's far enough!
I've got your 50 women.
Turn 'em loose
and send 'em on down here.
Mister?
Please, let me go.
I need you.
Now you go count those women,
put 'em in a car.
And you count loud.
Now!
Okay.
One, two...
three, four...
five, six, seven...
eight...
...19, 20, 21...
22, 23...
-
-Uh-uh.
- Keep going. Twenty-five.
-I'll tell you when.
Thirty, 31...
32, 33...
34...
...37, 38, 39,
40, 41, 42...
43, 44, 45, 46...
You know, a man could use
a good drink of water
out here.
-Couldn't he?
-...Forty-nine.
Fifty.
Let's get out of here, fast.
Are you all right?
Yes.
Adios, Domingo!
And you know?
Skunk was right!
You're a real friend.
You dumb son of a bitch.
Are you letting him go?
That's right.
Well, I'm gonna stop him.
Candy!
I'm still the one
who makes the decisions.
You understand?
He says
he wants 50 women.
Now he's got them.
It'll be
a long ride, girls.
Don't worry about it.
Just keep smiling.
'Cause we did it.
Broke it off
with that Domingo,
didn't we?
Well now.
Isn't this something?
One man and 50 women.
Yeah, that's something
you write home about,
isn't it?
What kind of
a son of a bitch
puts a snake
in a man's food?
If that snake bites me,
I might die.
And if I die...
you tell
your brother Candy
he's never gonna
see Pilar again.
What do you mean?
'Cause I have her.
He will
tell us everything.
Wait, huh?
If you kill him now,
he'll never tell you anything.
If you don't tell me
where she is...
I'll break every bone
in your body.
Shut your mouth,
General.
Is there a law
that forbids a man to sing?
Hmm?
General.
-
-
Stop!
She's in the shepherd's hut.
On a-- On a mountain.
Outside the Mexican village.
God damn.
Without eyes,
it's one thing.
Without that...
No, no, Blindman.
One, two...
four, five.
-
-
Can you girls hear me?
Yes.
Well, you just hold on.
And I'll be back.
You find a way
out of here, quick.
Yeah, let's go.
Wait, a minute. Stop.
What's wrong?
I forgot my hat.
Your hat?
Yeah, you gotta
get me my hat.
Your hat?
In this moment?
Ay, you goddamn
crazy gringo.
Here. Let's go.
Go.
-
-
They can plant
that son of a bitch.
Ah, this goddamn
crazy gringo.
You know, you're doing
one hell of a job.
Good job, your ass.
Let's go.
Uh...
We'll have to jump.
-How far?
-About ten feet.
That's my horse.
God damn.
-Is he below me?
-Yeah.
Huh? Okay.
-Come on, General.
-
-
-
This is mine.
But it is better
you come with me.
So I can
take care of you.
No.
You go on and get as far away
from here as you can.
- Ah, adios!
-
Haw, ha.
Hey. Blindman.
The blind man got away.
After he sent me
looking for Pilar.
-I should've killed him.
-Ha!
What did you expect
to find?
You fool!
Now, you listen to me.
And you listen
to me good.
You get that bitch
out of your mind.
You understand?
Don't say another word.
This is my business.
You keep out of it.
We looked everywhere.
The blind man is not here.
My brother wants
this girl.
So, we get her.
You hear me, Dude?
We get her.
I found some sticks
of dynamite
near the back entrance.
Let me feel it.
How much of this
did you find?
As much as you need.
That's good.
Now, you listen
to me, old man.
Get your wagon,
and fill it up with this.
Take this money.
You buy two more wagons.
Then you go to Domingo's fort
and you wait for me.
Go on.
Be careful.
But why you doing
all of this?
Doing all of what?
Getting yourself
into trouble.
The money?
Let me tell you something,
Pilar.
To have no eyes,
means to be half a man.
To have no eyes
and no money...
now, that's a bitch.
Come on now, I want you
to show me around this mine.
What are you doing here?
I'm getting in my wagon.
Where is Pilar?
The old gold mine.
The blind man?
I don't know.
You know, old man?
Once you called me
a pig?
He's coming.
-Is Domingo with him?
-I didn't see anyone else.
That's good.
Now, you wait for me
by the back entrance, okay?
Wait a sec!
Come here.
Take off your bloomers.
All right!
Hurry! Go on!
Faster!
Hurry, did you hear me?
Go higher!
Dude!
We find another entrance.
What's the matter
with you?
Why are you hiding?
Are you afraid?
You want your women,
don't you?
Well, I'll have him
give 'em back to you.
Come out,
you blind bastard.
I'll kill you!
When a woman's got you
by the short hairs, boy...
you're done.
Finished.
We gotta get out,
come on.
Candy!
Candy?
Wait here for me.
Sing!
Sing!
And what is the matter
with you?
I want my 50 women.
Give her to me.
Now, now, girls.
That's enough.
I still need
that bitch.
Now, come on.
-Haw! Haw!
-
Get them!
Dude!
Put the rest in the wagon
and bring that one to me.
Well, Sweet Mama,
I guess the sun
don't shine
on the same dog's ass
all the time.
Kill that lying bastard!
Take your eyes off my sister!
Get out!
Get out, all of you!
Now we wait for darkness.
No. He said we wait
for the night.
Now that you've given him
your blessing, priest...
-you can marry him.
-
And here is the bride!
But Domingo,
your brother is dead.
My brother is alive!
He is alive!
My brother
is a happy man.
He likes dancing.
And drinking.
And pretty women.
Sing for him!
You dance!
Now, you get drunk
for him!
I don't need a priest.
I don't need anyone.
I'll marry you myself.
Dude!
-
-
Domingo!
You lowlife pimp.
You know what
I'm gonna do to you?
I'm gonna break
your ass!
I want him alive.
Pilar.
Bitch.
Bitch.
Goddamn bitch bites.
Hey!
Hey!
We have to find
a place to hide.
We can go
to the ghost town.
How far is it?
Near here.
Okay, let's get my horse.
Come on.
Jesús!
Haw! Haw!
I'm going to get Domingo.
Point to him.
Come on.
Wait, wait a minute.
Gotta get my rifle.
Hey.
No, no.
Not now.
How many are there?
About 15.
That's enough then.
Let's go.
Get down on the ground.
Domingo.
I wish you no harm.
But that
all your teeth fall out.
Except for one.
And with that one,
you have a toothache
for rest of your life.
You son of a bitch.
Hey, gringo!
Stop.
He went through this door
in front of you.
Stand back.
Huh?
It's all over
for you, Blindman.
You goddamn
crazy gringo.
My eyes!
Now you find your gun.
No.
Domingo...
you're fucked.
Hey, General!
Over here, gringo.
Hey, General. Listen.
I gotta deal for you.
No, no.
You don't owe me nothing.
You saved my life,
I save your life.
Now, we are even.
No, no.
It's not that.
I have a contract
that guarantees me $50,000,
if I deliver those women
to Lost Creek, Texas.
So, why don't you
come along with me?
We'll make
lots of money together.
But why you like
money so much?
I like to buy things.
And you buy things, gringo.
Buy lots of things.
And when you
have everything,
you come see me
sometime, eh?
Adios!
You goddamn crazy gringo.
Vamos, muchachos!
Boy, he's really
a nice man.
Where will you go now?
Well, I still have to bring
those women to Texas.
Would you help me
round them up?
But the women?
The general took them.
He took them?
Yes, in the wagons.
No.
He took them?
Oh, no.
Pilar.
That general,
that's what I call
a dirty,
two-faced son of a bitch.
Haw!
