Don't turn around.
Keep your hands to your side.
I'll move with you
while you get those keys off the desk.
Come on, move.
All right. Now, open that center cell.
What if I don't?
If you don't, I'll kill you,
take your keys and open it myself.
Yeah, I guess you could.
Well, who would have thought?
Now, don't dawdle, Fred.
I know this man,
he gets kind of jumpy in a crisis.
- How far do you think you'll get, Clint?
- I'm not gonna ask you once more, mister.
Yes, sir, who would've thought?
Turn around.
Now, Fred, about them runny eggs
you been giving me for breakfast...
Sure couldn't have picked a worse time
to come walking in, could they?
Hope I haven't woke the whole town.
That's enough shooting for today.
Mind if I get down and stretch?
Help yourself.
You living somewhere around here
these days, Jake?
Nope.
Then how'd you know
about my little predicament?
I was just riding through, heard about it.
- Lucky for me.
- Yeah, isn't it?
Hyah.
Well, there they go.
How come you didn't
let them hang me, Jake?
You think we got time
to talk this all out now, Clint?
Well, just the same, I think you'd have been
way ahead if you let them hang me.
Although I won't pretend
I was looking forward to it too much.
Yeah.
When I was the one they wanted to hang,
I got downright resentful.
Well, this is where I leave you.
Well, which way you heading, Jake?
Maybe we could ride together a ways.
Not a chance, Clint.
Hey, you know,
this is a real nice, little horse.
- Gonna take it with you?
- The horse is yours.
No kidding?
Well, thanks, Jake. Thanks very much.
That's real generous of you.
Of course, I don't suppose...
I don't suppose even you'd suggest
that he's worth anything like...
...oh, say $20,000?
I didn't keep that money, Clint.
You didn't?
Well, what did you do with it?
Give it to some deserving family?
I buried it. And after I did,
I never went back there again.
As far as I know, it's still there.
Now, that seems a peculiar thing
for you to do, Jake.
Whatever come over you
to do a thing like that?
- You wouldn't understand, Clint.
- I might.
I kind of doubt it, but I might.
I guess you figure
this squares us up, huh?
You pulled me out
of exactly the same spot one time...
...now I've done it for you.
To me, one cancels the other.
But if you don't feel that way about it...
You know, you could save yourself
a lot of sleepless nights...
...if you just tossed me a gun
and we had this out right here and now.
Not a chance.
What's the difference
whether it's now or later?
A lot of difference, Clint.
In the first place, I don't think
it has to be now or later or anytime.
But if it does,
I'll pick the time and the place myself.
Uh-uh.
No, you won't, Jake.
Don't try to follow me, Clint.
If you remember,
I'm pretty good with one of these.
Yeah. Yeah, I remember.
But you're not as good as me.
Just...
Just pretty good.
Glad to see you back, Jake.
- Hi, Jake.
- Hello, Luke.
- When did you get here?
- Just now.
- Hi, Avery.
- Hi, Jake.
- Get all your business attended to?
- Yeah, sure did.
Anything important happen
while I was gone?
Well, nothing much around here.
But did you hear
what happened to Clint Hollister?
No. What about him?
You knew he'd been tried for murder
and convicted at Morganville.
Some of his gang broke him out.
Shot up a couple of men pretty bad.
- How bad?
- Well, they're gonna live.
- Haven't caught him yet?
- No, and they ain't gonna.
He's probably five states away
by this time.
The old town
wasn't the same without you.
Well, it's always nice to be missed.
Thanks, Avery.
Say, what happened
to that little gelding of yours?
The one you took with you.
Oh, I sold him to a fellow.
Oh. See you later.
You wanna get caught up on this?
No, that can wait till tomorrow.
Do you mind hanging around a while longer?
I'll relieve you early tonight.
Why, sure.
Say hello to Peggy for me.
Who's the young fellow
holding up the post?
Just a kid who drifted in yesterday
looking for a job on one of the ranches.
I'll say one thing for him,
he's not looking very hard.
- See you later, Jake.
- Right.
Oh, the rig I rented from the livery stable.
The suit's mine.
I'm overwhelmed.
But what's the reason for all this elegance?
You've already proposed.
And I'm glad I accepted.
- Dinner ready?
- Mm-hm. Ready and getting cold.
Where's your uncle?
Oh, he had to go into town
late this afternoon for some supplies.
How come every time I come out here...
...that's the day he has to go into town
for supplies?
Well, I hope you don't think
it's easy to arrange.
Jake.
Peggy, did you find it a big wrench...
...when you pulled up stakes
in Philadelphia to come out here?
No, not nearly as much
as I thought it would be.
Why?
Suppose the same thing
might apply again?
I mean, if we suddenly left here
and moved on further west?
If we left here?
Well, why should we, Jake?
We've built a real place for ourselves,
both of us.
The job you've done
as marshal here in the last year...
...why, it can lead to anything.
We could do the same thing
somewhere else.
Yes, we could, but, well, why should we?
We're here and we've already done it.
Don't you have any curiosity
about what it's like further west?
No.
And I don't think basically you do either.
Oh, Jake, you're not a drifter.
You love it here.
You couldn't have fooled everyone
about that.
No, and I wouldn't have anyway.
Well, then why do you want to leave?
Supposing it wasn't
that I wanted to leave...
...but that I felt
it might be better for both of us...
...to get a fresh start somewhere else.
Well, then I'd say
that since this concerns me so much...
...I should know why
so that I can judge for myself.
And if I couldn't tell you?
Then I'd say
you were asking an awful lot.
All right, I'm asking a lot.
Jake, I never asked you
anything about your past life...
...because I didn't care about anything
that happened before we met each other.
But what you're asking me to accept
on faith now concerns our future.
And I just can't be casual and haphazard
about a thing like that.
All right, forget I said anything about it.
Forget it?
Oh, Peggy.
Peggy.
I'm sorry, Jake.
I know.
It's just that the way you talked,
it sounded as if you'd already decided.
That's not true. You're only guessing
when you talk like that.
Well, what else am I to do but guess
when you won't tell me anything?
Oh, Jake, can't you tell me?
No, Peggy, I can't. Not yet.
All right.
Well, when you can, you let me know.
- Marshal Wade?
- Yeah.
I've been kind of waiting
for you to get back to town.
Is that so?
I've been trying to find
a job around here.
Al, the bartender
over at the Mint Saloon...
...said that you might be able
to steer me on to something.
- Where you from?
- Kansas.
Well, I sure haven't got anything for you.
I can give you a letter
to somebody who might have.
If you don't mind hard work.
Well, I ain't exactly crazy about it...
...but I can see the necessity for it.
Pretty neat, Jake. Hold it.
Better drop your gun belt, Jake.
How you been, Ortero?
No complaints. How about you, Jake?
Now, don't go blaming your deputy
too much for me having this gun, Jake.
Who'd have thought a fat, sloppy drunk
lying in the gutter...
...would have a pistol hidden in his boot?
Hello, Jake.
Put him in the chair.
How do you feel?
How do you think?
I can remember a time when all you'd have
done for a clout like that was scratch it.
How'd you stay so close behind me?
I backtracked a dozen times.
I'd have sworn I wasn't being followed.
You wasn't.
How'd you find me?
Easy.
When you left me,
I joined up with the boys...
...we turned loose
that nice, little horse you gave me...
...followed him home.
We've been here since early yesterday
while you was doing your backtracking.
And I must say, Jake,
it was worth the whole trip...
...just to find out
that you're the marshal here.
- Hi, Wexler.
- Don't talk to me, Jake.
Wexler, my boy,
how many times have I told you...
...if you let your hate get the upper hand,
it'll throw your timing off.
What was it
we used to try to tell him, Jake?
Something there we used to say...
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, we used to say:
"Wexler, you go ahead and kill
anybody you want to, it's a free country.
If you do it with hate in your heart...
...you'll end up with nothing
but an upset stomach."
I don't think he ever understood
what we was talking about, do you, Jake?
What you got in mind, Clint?
What are your plans for me?
I'm gonna kill you.
But not for a while, so you don't
have to try nothing desperate just yet.
Let go of me! Take your hands off me! Oh!
She didn't wanna come along, Clint.
Persuading somebody
don't usually take you so long, kid.
Some old man
came out of her house with a shotgun.
It took me time
to work around behind him.
What did you do to him?
What do you care?
You his lodge brother?
- Jake, what is all this?
- Oh, say, Clint.
She was a little slow getting dressed,
so we had to help her along a little bit...
...on account of she was so slow.
- That's enough. That's enough.
- I'll kill him if he tries it.
You know why we're taking her along,
don't you...?
- I just know you're not going to.
- Oh, but we have to.
See, if you know something
might happen to her...
...if you try to play it too smart, then maybe
you'll take us right to the money...
...instead of leading us
all around the hills for days and days.
Just let her stay here.
I promise to take you wherever...
Oh, come on, Jake,
you know better than to try that with me.
We'd better not hang around here
too long, Clint.
Is that a fact, Burke?
Is she gonna ride in that getup?
No, I grabbed some of her stuff.
All right, let's go.
- Jake, don't let them. Please, Jake.
- Now, listen, miss.
You'd better get it through your head
we ain't playing games.
You three ride out of town ahead of us,
we'll meet you at the camp.
Jake, I think it'll look better
if you ride out of town alone.
We'll see you at the end of the street.
Wait a minute.
What makes you think he's gonna ride
to the end of the street and wait for us?
Wexler, Jake's in love.
He'll play along with us.
Won't you, Jake?
All right, get moving.
Hey, Jake.
Jake.
You wanna hear something funny?
- Yeah.
- You know that little gelding...
...you said you sold to somebody?
- Yeah.
Well, I was going past Ed Hurley's place,
and you know something?
I thought I saw that gelding in his corral.
You know something?
I know you saw him.
- Evening.
- Evening.
All right, Jake, let's go.
Yup.
I was afraid that when you
changed out of that dress...
...maybe you wouldn't look too good.
But even in them old things, you're
about the best-Iooking gal I've ever seen.
Say, was you really gonna marry
that Jake guy?
Why?
Because maybe I'm kind of interested...
...in why girls
do some of the crazy things they do.
You see, I never had
a whole lot to do with girls.
I wonder why.
Because my old man thought
he was a preacher, that's why.
And because he used to whale
the daylights out of me...
...if he even saw me look at a girl,
or a girl look at me.
Your father was a preacher?
Kind of a phony evangelist.
I tell you, he was about the meanest man
I ever met in my life.
He just naturally would like to beat up
on anything that was smaller than him.
And of course, he could always say
he was beating the fear of God into you.
Well, where is he now?
Well, I hope I know where he is.
You see,
he was the first man I ever killed.
Hey, Burke,
you'd better cook up more stuff.
Some of the other guys are coming.
Yes, master.
Any trouble, Clint?
No.
Get him something to eat.
And tie his hands behind him.
From now on, he stays tied.
Why don't you just leave him to me?
Sonny, I can see we ain't gonna
have you round long enough...
...to get tired of your company.
He ain't that tough.
He ain't, huh?
Well, let's put it this way.
Let's just say because I'm getting old
and hearing noises in the night...
...would you mind
tying him up for my sake? Hmm?
I see the kid didn't waste much time
getting your clothes changed.
Well, now, Burke, what tasty little dish have
you cooked up for breakfast this morning?
Take a stretch, Jake.
I told you,
there's no use fighting them ropes.
If I'm showing strain, it's from hanging on
to that horse for eight hours with my knees.
No kidding. Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk.
I did it once for a whole week.
They caught me up in the Dakotas.
Rode me clear back to Kansas. Heh.
All that way just for a stage holdup.
Of course,
I busted loose before we got there.
Killed one deputy with a rock.
Killed the other one with a rifle.
Maybe something like that
will happen to you, Jake.
Mm.
Trouble is, you got one problem
that I was never saddled with.
The girl.
Well, it just goes to show...
...no matter how pleasant they are
to have around...
...a woman does slow a man up.
But then so does a busted leg.
How much further
are we going today, Clint?
Well, that depends on how much further
we got to go altogether, Jake.
You know, you haven't been exactly what
I'd call explicit about where this place is.
You haven't satisfied me about what
happens to her after I do take you there.
It's what's gonna happen to her
if you don't take me there.
And as you know,
I ain't a great one for patiently waiting.
I don't want you to think
I'm rushing you into anything, Jake.
You just think it over.
You've got a little time left.
Boost him up.
Now, come on, miss, cheer up.
We'll stop and camp when it gets dark.
Maybe tonight we'll sing a few songs
around the campfire.
Move out.
Jake, when you left
to take care of that personal business...
...was it to get him out of jail?
Yeah.
How long have you known him?
Don't let me interrupt.
You in much pain, Jake?
You ever been
up in these mountains before, miss?
- No.
- Really?
Well, you've missed some of the most
breathtaking scenery in the whole world.
You know, I heard a foreigner say once...
...that there wasn't nothing
in the Swiss Alps...
...that could beat the Rocky Mountains
when it come to scenic grandeur.
It kind of made me proud to be an American
when he said that.
You ever been to Swiss Alps, miss?
- No.
- Hmm.
Jake and me,
we always figured on going...
...but something was always coming up
at the last minute, you know how it is.
Remember how we was always
talking about pulling out...
...and taking a trip
to the Swiss Alps, Jake?
Yeah, I remember.
The places we was gonna go.
The things we was gonna see.
Heh.
It was always the next job we pulled
that was gonna give us the money to do it.
Something always happened.
Then one day,
Jake wasn't around no more.
And I didn't figure
it would be much fun by myself.
All of which should have
a moral to it someplace.
Maybe it's...
Maybe it's, "Them that robs too many banks
never gets to see the Swiss Alps."
- That stuff ready yet?
- As ready as it's ever gonna be.
Come on, let's eat.
Peggy, don't get that close to me again.
Get back over there.
We're not going to have much chance
to talk anyway.
But if he figures you're trying to untie me,
that will be the end of it.
I know how you feel about all this and what
you must think of me for getting you into it.
That's not it.
Well, I should have told you.
Aside from all that, if we've got any chance,
it's going to be from working together.
Jake, you saved his life,
he wouldn't kill you.
Not after you take him to the money.
You don't think he's bluffing, do you?
Peggy, listen to me.
He's going to kill me.
There isn't a chance he won't.
Believe me, I know.
One thing's sure.
Sometime, at one point,
there's going to be a split second...
...when we'll have
a one-in-a-million chance, there always is.
Clint knows that as well as I do,
so do the others.
Now, get back where you were.
All right.
Hold it.
- What happened?
- He fell off, almost landed on his head.
But not quite, huh?
Well, I don't know how he stuck up
there this far, Clint.
Well, he can keep falling off
till he breaks every bone in his body...
...and he still ain't
gonna get his hands untied.
That's real smart, isn't it?
You want the money, yet the only man who
knows where it is, you let break his neck.
Now, wait a minute, miss,
that falling off a horse is a real moldy trick.
I ain't about to let him
take me in with that.
Supposing it isn't a trick?
- Oh, come on,
- There's something in what she says.
Tie his hands in front
so he could hang on to the saddle horn.
He stays the way he is.
Get him back up there.
Clint!
He can't stay on this way, Clint.
All right, tie his hands in front.
And get him back in that saddle.
Cut him loose. I'll get some more rope.
Come on with that rope already.
Clint!
Clint!
You boys get back down
to the bottom of the draw.
Back that way. Go on.
We're all right now, Peggy. We made it.
Almost.
Just toss up the gun, Jake.
How long you been waiting up there?
I've been around here
for a couple hours anyway.
Why didn't you go
to the head of the canyon?
That'd have been the easy way out.
Yeah, but I've never known you
to do anything the easy way.
Ortero!
What a slide.
It was a good try, Jake.
Must have been quite a shock
to you, miss...
...thinking you'd gotten away safe
and all.
Of course, if Jake had been alone,
it might have been different.
Then he wouldn't go without you,
would he?
Hmm?
Well, I was guilty
of that kind of weakness myself once.
Remember the time I just couldn't bear
to leave you behind, Jake?
Well, you seem kind of puzzled, miss.
Ever tell her how you happened
to get mixed up with somebody like me?
- Why are you so interested?
- I'd like to hear it.
- You wouldn't like my version.
- Probably wouldn't.
Jake, what's he talking about?
We were in the same outfit in the war,
all of us except Rennie.
It was a guerrilla unit
raiding Northern-border towns.
We'd shoot out way in,
loot the town and then shoot our way out.
I was doing it as a soldier.
Clint did it because, well,
that's the same thing he'd always done.
The war hadn't changed his life a bit.
Just made it legal.
After the war, we kept right on
with what we'd been doing...
...robbing banks, holding up stages.
Of course, you can guess
that this didn't seem to bother Clint at all.
Well, why should it?
During the war they... Hey.
During the war,
they made me an officer and a gentleman...
...for doing the same things they
was gonna hang me for a few days ago.
Now, you can't tell me
that makes any sense, Jake.
There's a difference,
but you'll never understand it.
I suppose you're talking about
something like honor, ain't you?
Which is supposed to be
too deep for me to understand.
Well, all I know is if you got honor,
you don't run out on a friend, right?
Why did you run out on me?
- You know why.
- No, I don't.
I didn't like killing kids.
Jake, what are you talking about?
We'd held up a bank.
During the getaway,
a young boy got caught in the crossfire.
I killed him.
And that's what made you
run out on me?
Just killing that kid?
That was it.
Tssh...
Well, it could've been an accident.
Yeah, it could've been,
but the boy was killed.
I got caught and they threw me in jail.
There was a lynch mob within 10 minutes.
That's when Clint, as he says,
just couldn't bear to leave me behind.
He broke me out.
In the mix-up,
I wound up with Clint's horse.
- And the money from the bank.
- Yeah.
And then I knew I'd had enough.
I buried the money
and kept right on going.
And I waited for you a whole week.
Took me a whole week
to get it through my thick head...
...that he'd run out on me.
All right, friend,
when do we get to that money?
What are you really after, Clint?
The money or me?
When do we get to the money?
Tomorrow. We'll be there tomorrow.
We're gonna have some company!
Cavalry patrol.
Have they seen us?
I don't know.
Cut the ropes.
What are we gonna do now, Clint?
What do you think we should do,
turn and run?
Now, listen, miss.
Whatever happens, when we meet them,
it ain't gonna do you or Jake no good.
You try anything, you'll both be dead,
do you understand?
Relax, Mr. Hollister.
I'm quite convinced
you'd kill me without a qualm.
You got that?
Yeah, I got it.
Now, don't act jumpy.
They got no reason to suspect us,
so don't give them none.
I'll do the talking.
Howdy, lieutenant.
Well, we sure weren't looking to see any
of our brave Army boys around here.
You're no more surprised
than we are, Mr...
Bricker, lieutenant. Morgan Bricker.
And this Jake Wade,
he's the marshal over at Coldstream.
- Where you headed, marshal?
- Up into the San Marcos range, why?
There's been some bad trouble
with the Indians.
And I don't think, Mr. Bricker...
...marshal, that this is any place
for a woman right now.
I'd suggest you let us escort you
back to the fort.
- You can make it home from there.
- Oh, I think we can handle this, lieutenant.
I have the authority
to order you out of here, you know.
Yes, I know you do, lieutenant.
But I sure wish
you'd leave the decision up to us.
I certainly hate to tell you your business,
Mr. Bricker, but I think under the...
Lieutenant,
could we talk to you alone for a minute?
All right.
Marshal.
See, lieutenant,
we got a little problem here.
The young lady's father took off
to go prospecting in these mountains.
He's about a month overdue.
Well,
I guess we all know what that means.
I was a good friend of her father...
...so when she was about to start off
on her own to look for him...
...we decided we'd better come along.
- I see.
- I tell you, lieutenant...
...since we know the situation now,
we'll just circle around here in the foothills...
...for a couple of days
like we was looking, see?
But really going no place where we might
be putting her in any danger.
How's that?
You go along with that, marshal?
Yeah, that's the thing to do
under the circumstances.
You sure you wanna go on, miss?
- Yes.
- All right.
Goodbye, miss.
- Good luck, Mr. Bricker, marshal.
- Thank you, lieutenant.
- Sergeant.
- March out.
Thanks, Jake.
Tie him up.
We'll have every Comanche
for 100 miles on our necks.
What's the matter with you?
Don't try to make anything out of this,
Jake.
I may not have to.
I'm sorry, Clint.
It's just that I can't stand
the filthy coyotes.
- I didn't stop to think.
- We'll chisel that on your tombstone.
I said I was sorry.
Right about now,
I guess Jake's sorry too.
But that ain't gonna keep him
from getting killed.
- What do you mean by that?
- Oh, what do you care what I mean?
I don't like people
that talk to me like that.
You don't, huh?
So, what are you gonna do about it?
Some more of that doing
without thinking?
I'll do plenty.
You gonna draw on me, Rennie?
I ought to shoot your ears off.
- What are we gonna do now?
- About what?
You ain't just going and keep right on riding
right into a massacre, are you?
Why, no, Burke.
- I thought we'd avoid that if we could.
- And how are we gonna do that?
You don't think a single Comanche
for 20 miles missed those shots, do you?
Now, get this.
There's a lot of money buried around here
that belongs to me.
And what belongs to me, I get.
Now, anybody
that don't wanna go along...
...is perfectly free to just turn around
and start riding back down the canyon.
Of course, anybody that does
will get a bullet in his back.
Ain't nobody turning back, Clint.
Ail right, boys.
Just a little difference of opinion, miss.
Happens in the best-run organizations.
Lead off, Jake.
This is it, huh?
This is it.
Go ahead.
Clint, there's some tracks there.
How many, you think?
Six or eight here.
Not over two hours ago.
And it could've been 10 minutes.
What do you think, Jake?
They're still right around here.
Now, just how do you read that
from the tracks?
I don't have to.
I can see one of them from here.
Don't move, anybody.
Building's got you covered,
I don't think he's seen us yet.
Where is he?
If you step out, he'll be just to your left
on top of the ridge.
Hold it, Clint.
Can I get him with a rifle?
Well, I know I could,
but I haven't seen you shoot lately.
Rennie, the rifle.
He still there?
Yeah, but you'll only have one shot, Clint.
He's gonna see you the minute you move.
How far?
Oh, about a hundred yards.
You missed him.
Yeah.
Oh, and, Clint,
there's another thing I forgot to tell you.
What?
There's two more.
Well, you're real smart, ain't you?
You're wasting a lot of time
if you're going after them.
Oh, so that's it.
You think with me out of the way,
you'll be...
You hear that boys?
Well, I am going after them...
...because they're riding off to tell the rest
of that hunting party about us.
But that ain't gonna help you a bit, Jake.
It'll be dark in an hour, hole up here.
- Can I go with you, Clint?
- No.
I want you all right here when he pulls
whatever it is he's got in mind.
Get the horses out of sight.
This might take a little longer
than I figure. Wait for me.
But if I'm not back by midnight...
...the money's all yours, boys.
And, kid...
...I hope you and the girl
will be very happy.
Let's get out of sight.
After you, marshal.
Keep an eye on Jake.
He ain't going nowhere, don't worry.
No?
Like yesterday in the canyon, maybe?
Let's see how long
we can hold onto him this time.
Sit down, Jake.
Get a long piece of rope, Wexler.
Burke...
...you see any Indians,
don't tell me till we get some food.
Rennie.
You see anything?
Nothing.
You got an extra smoke, Ortero?
Hey, Wexler, maybe we ought to
send Burke on a little scouting expedition.
Shut up, Rennie.
Hey, what's the matter
with that kid, Rennie?
He's crazy.
Where'd Clint find him?
Las Cruces, last June.
They were looking for you.
I'm gonna kill him one of these days.
Remember those first days
when we were riding together, Ortero?
Yeah, I remember.
I know what you're getting at, Jake.
I'm not getting at anything.
You want me to remember
how we fought a whole war together.
How you took me with you
when you went to join Clint.
The number of times
we've saved each others lives.
Well, on that basis, I always figured
we came out just about even.
I hope you mean that, Jake, because
there's nothing I can do for you now.
You can get her out of here.
Not even that.
I found out what happens
when you cross Clint.
What are you guys doing in here?
We wanna eat.
All right, untie Jake so he can eat.
- You think we'd better?
- Sure, let him loose.
Then if he tries to make a break for it,
we can kill him.
He's the only one
who knows where the money is.
So we can get out of here
and the Indians won't get our scalps.
Clint wants him alive.
And don't either of you forget that.
Now, untie him.
The kid give you an idea, Wexler?
I wouldn't cross Clint.
You know that, Jake.
Maybe Clint ain't coming back.
You hope.
No, you hope.
He'll be back, don't worry about that.
Clint always comes back.
Who said we didn't
want him to come back?
Now, if I had been Clint...
...and I really wanted to find myself
some Indians, I'd have stayed right here.
What do you mean?
Probably got more Indians
surrounding us right now...
...than Custer had to fight at Bighorn.
So what?
We don't have to worry till it gets light,
and we'll probably be out of here by then.
Who says you don't have to worry
until it gets light?
Indians don't attack at night,
everybody knows that.
Apaches don't attack at night,
but they're the only ones who don't.
These are Comanches.
Well, then get back outside.
You're wasting your time
working on them, Jake.
Do you think so?
Jake, I wish I could help you.
Yeah, I know.
Well, this much I can do.
Jake, you didn't kill that kid.
What?
- Well, who did kill him?
- Jake didn't do it.
Of course, Clint always wanted him
to think that he had.
You know what Clint's like.
Always likes to have something
on everybody that's with him.
Well, who did kill the boy?
Well, I do know that Jake didn't.
Because the boy was already dead
when Jake and Clint come out of the bank.
Thanks, Ortero.
Now, the trouble is, Jake...
...Clint always liked you better
than anybody he ever met.
Yeah, I know.
What about you and Jake, Ortero?
It doesn't make any difference.
I didn't ask you for anything,
I just asked you how you felt about Jake.
- That's the end of this talk.
- Look...
I said, that's the end of this talk.
Now, get over there and sit down.
All right, Mr. Ortero.
What do you suppose them coyotes
is howling so about?
You really think them's coyotes,
don't you?
Sure they are.
I heard enough of them up in...
You mean...?
I mean, they're Comanches.
They're Comanches,
and what are we doing about it?
We're sitting right here
like customers in a barbershop...
...waiting our turn
to get a nice, close haircut.
- Yeah, but Clint said we should...
- Clint said.
Clint said.
You notice that Clint got out of here,
didn't you?
Rennie's right.
Let's go tell Ortero
we're getting out of here.
You wanna stay here alone?
Not me.
Jake.
We're getting out of here.
We feel like a sitting duck.
All we know, we're being lined up
in the sights of some Comanche right now.
Nobody's happy about it.
We're leaving.
Fine.
That way or that way?
I suppose you know just where
the Indians are. What about the money?
I don't know how you feel, but that money
don't mean a thing to me anymore.
That goes for me. You, Burke?
I don't want any part of it.
What about them?
Leave them here with some food
and a couple of canteens, but no horses.
If they make it, fine. If they don't...
- They had their chance.
- That's right.
- Wexler?
- Leave them here or shoot them.
It don't make no difference to me.
All right, they stay.
And I think maybe I'll stay too.
And keep going for the money
now that I've come this far.
- By yourself?
- Sure.
That way,
he got nobody to split it up with.
Let him stay, he'll get hisself killed.
Thanks.
Come on, let's get out of here.
That's all right with me.
But it ain't all right with me.
You boys
seem to be getting a little jumpy.
You can stay if you want to, Clint,
but we're going.
You are?
We don't want the money,
you can have it.
I can?
We're going, Clint!
Let's see if you are.
Stop it.
There ain't gonna be no shooting.
We're in trouble enough.
You got us in a real mess, Clint.
This is what, I'm ta...
I guess you boys
ain't gonna be going far now...
...so get down to the end of the street.
Cover the ridge in this end of town
and get him out of here.
Watch him.
All right, Jake, get in that chair.
Let go of him, let go.
Ortero, move over to the house,
you can cross-cover there.
Stay there.
Oh, you ain't gonna be needing this,
are you?
- Jake, I can't.
- Peggy, get a knife.
- Where?
- Burke, there's one in his belt.
Stay low.
You ain't gonna hit nobody that way.
Stay close behind me.
That's far enough, Jake.
Inside.
Ortero, that's the last of them.
Move.
Well, did you say a few words
over the boys?
Yeah.
Goodbye.
That's very touching.
All right, Jake, now's the time.
Where is it?
Right up there.
I should've known.
Now, look, Jake,
if you're stalling again...
Wouldn't be much of a stall.
Let's go.
This is it.
Here?
How long is it gonna take you?
- I buried it pretty deep.
- How deep?
- Three or 4 feet.
- Well, get going.
What do you bury that in,
or is all that money gonna be rotted?
I buried your whole saddlebag.
Well, dig it up.
Toss him the shovel.
Just...
Just what did you hope to accomplish
by running off and burying this?
Why didn't you just come to me and say,
"Clint, I'm quitting"?
Why didn't you do that, huh?
Gotta loosen this up with something.
You never give up, do you?
Now, there's the chance
you've been waiting for, Jake.
The only question is...
...do you wanna die now
or in a few minutes?
Go ahead.
You might pull it off.
You sure couldn't have been in much of
a hurry that day, burying it down that deep.
I don't understand it.
How come you buried it...?
Get them up, both of you.
Heh. I guess I forgot about that one.
Guess you did.
Drop your gun belt, Clint.
You too, Ortero.
Now, wait a minute. Not so fast, Jake.
That thing's been buried for over a year.
You don't really think
it's gonna shoot, do you?
We can find out if you want to.
Now, look, Jake.
You're bluffing, and we both know it.
Am I?
All right, so it does shoot.
All you'll win is a tie for first place.
You know I'd get you before I die.
Neither of us know that.
You ain't sure it'll fire.
You're not sure it won't.
How about those gun belts?
All right, Ortero.
Pick them up, Peggy.
Ortero, go get the horses.
Peggy, you go with him.
- What are you gonna do?
- Go on, Peggy.
Please, Jake, don't bother with him.
He can't hurt us now.
I just want to talk to him alone.
Start walking, Ortero.
What do I do, Clint?
He's holding the gun, do what he says.
Hey, Jake, you ain't gonna keep me
in suspense, are you?
- What about?
- Whether that thing would've fired or not.
Well, on the other hand,
it might have gone off like a cannon.
Then think how silly I would've looked.
Go on, Peggy, I'll be done in a minute.
- Jake, please be careful.
- Go on, Peggy.
Well, what happens now?
You gonna shoot me down
like a dirty dog?
I wouldn't do it like this
and you know it.
Yeah, that's what I always
liked about you, Jake.
You're real fair and square.
Now that I'm holding the gun, you're willing
to give me my honor back, huh, Clint?
That makes us even again.
Should be easy to settle the rest.
- Wait here until I get back.
- Let's settle it now.
- Wait here.
- Sure, Jake.
Seeing as you got my gun, my knife...
...you're pretty safe
to leave me sitting on my honor.
And you take your time, Jake.
Take your time.
I'll be here.
We are leaving now, aren't we, Jake?
That's right, Peggy.
Ortero.
Let's pick up some loose guns.
Mount up, Peggy.
Ortero.
You've got to get her back home for me.
If he was dead,
would that make any difference to you?
A threat or promise?
I don't know.
All right, Jake, I'll take the chance.
Leave Clint's horse there.
No.
No, Jake, you can't go back.
- We're safe now.
- Trust me to do what I have to do.
Jake, if you go back there,
he's gonna kill you.
No, Jake, please.
Please don't go back.
Well...
...I see she's on her way.
How about a smoke?
Oh, come on.
It might be your last.
Or mine.
Either way, you can't lose. Hmm?
Tell me something, Clint.
Sure.
Things had worked out
the way you planned...
...were you gonna give me a gun
or just shoot me in the back?
Well,
that's an interesting question, Jake.
I'd say I was gonna give you a gun.
All right.
There's your gun.
I was gonna hand you yours.
Well, you like me a lot better
than I like you.
