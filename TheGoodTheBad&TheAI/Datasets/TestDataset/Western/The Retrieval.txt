Speak up, boy,
'fore I lay into you.
There's three of 'em.
Two is men.
And inside?
Just an old white woman.
You sure, now?
But she got a shotgun.
Well,
you boys try not
to piss yourselves.
Hyah! Hyah!
Watch it!
- Watch it!
- Watch it!
Okay, let's go!
- Get up!
- Come on!
Come on. Come on.
That's money is what that is.
That nigger's worth $600,
and you ain't.
You owe that boy an apology.
I'm sorry, Burrell, for...
Don't tell me.
I apologize.
This lost property is
to be protected until returned.
I got three rolled.
Pay me first.
Last time you ain't pay me.
Make sure
your uncle shares that.
You ain't thank me.
Thank you, Marcus.
Ain't no need
to be countin', boy.
Don't I provide
when no one else did?
You welcome to set out
on your own.
Go on now. Feed them niggers.
It's your turn.
Y'all thirsty?
I got something for you.
Name of the man
you're looking for is Nate.
He's diggin' graves for the
Federals near Petersburg.
About three, four nights
from here by foot.
I don't reckon I'd be
welcome anyplace near.
And this nigger just gonna
happily walk his self back south?
Well, they buried his brother not
two months ago down in Leesville.
News ain't made it up there.
You'll think of somethin'.
How 'bout you give me
In case I don't make it back.
Even if I do, he'd be yours.
He can cook, tend horses.
Should keep the boy.
Might need him.
Besides, you do this right, you're gonna
need help carryin' all that gold.
There's a lot of country
between here and there.
And to the north
and south of either place.
And out west.
If a man don't want to be found,
there's many places he can go.
Where you can go.
Don't matter.
If you don't bring this nigger
back exactly how I say,
I'll find you
and put you in the ground,
along with the boy...
and everybody else
you ever knew.
Wake up.
Why we goin' so far
for just one runaway?
Can leave you here
if you don't like it.
Makes no difference.
Why can't we just...
Money's why.
And this one's worth more than
them other three put together.
I'll take that.
Who you think
used to live here?
Now just keep quiet and listen.
When we get back with him,
we stay the last night...
When we get back with him,
we stay the last night here.
When you get up, you go get
Burrell 'fore that nigger wakes.
They not a mile that way.
And I don't want no talkin' about how you
been here before or none of that shit.
Understand?
Good. Go on.
Get down on the ground.
Lay down there. What?
Boy, get down on the ground
like you sleepin'.
Now get up
and get out that door.
So I can't hear ya.
Again.
You ain't asleep.
So you hear everything.
Goddamn it, boy.
Again.
If he's got a knife or something, we gotta
take it from him while he's sleepin'.
This ain't like sneakin' out
the other night...
when they was scared and they
ain't had nowhere else to go.
This one's somethin' else.
Go on, now.
Your name Nate, sir?
I-I'm Will from...
That's my Uncle Marcus.
From around Leesville.
We come on account
of your brother, Samuel?
He got consumption.
He ain't well.
Say he ain't gonna last long.
Can't go back down there.
Your brother said...
he wants to see you
before he goes.
- He ask us to tell you that.
- How'd you find me?
Your brother heard you was here.
I don't know how.
When was this?
Three days back.
And you just took it upon
yourself to deliver the word?
His master, Pritchards, tasked
us with it, and we'll be paid.
Say he ain't got long.
He just wants to see you.
Should we tell
your brother somethin'?
'Bout why you ain't
come back for him?
Y'all from Leesville?
Huh. He in a bad way?
I'll see to it when I can.
We should all
head back together.
Can we journey back with you?
The two of you make it up
here on your own? Yes, sir.
Then... I figure you can make
it back down on your own too.
Well, we won't be a bother.
Besides, we came
all this way for you.
We'll leave before sunup.
And we stay off the roads.
I can't be liable
for foolish children.
Now, go on.
You want my advice, we'll make it
there in three days if we head up...
Don't want your advice.
Well, you need it,
ornery bastard.
- You headed that way?
Yeah.
You welcome to take
any path you want.
Marcus know the best way.
You ain't got nothin'
to worry about.
You ever seen
a cannon shoot off?
I've heard 'em lots.
Just never seen 'em.
-Why do you think... -Didn't your mama ever
teach you to shut up and listen sometime?
I never knew my mama.
How long has it been
since you run up north?
I ain't a runaway.
That's too much
for you to be carryin', boy.
My father gave me that.
I don't give a damn
who gave it to you.
I ain't spending it
till I see him next.
Yeah, keep on rubbin'
that thing.
Shine it up.
You rub that thing half as good as you
was rubbin' your johnson last night,
it'll shine right up.
Might even blind a man.
He's  lyin'.
Hell, he could rub the eagle right off
the back of that coin till it's smooth.
Least he's good at one thing.
I was a professional
at his age.
They's stuck on your back.
Why they stick like that?
Don't serve no purpose.
It's a seed.
That way they travel further
than they could on their own.
But why do they... You
wearin' me out, boy.
- Well, I just...
- Shh.
Hear that?
- No. What's it sound like?
- Keep listenin'.
Very quiet.
- Was that it?
- Ah!
Why we takin' him back to
Burrell if he ain't a runaway?
What?
He owe Burrell money.
And they might have to
rough him up to get it,
so stop getting
all friendly with him.
Maybe he'll just pay up
so they won't have to.
He made his choices.
And don't forget
what we stand to collect.
Tonight, you try and
sneak out in the night.
See how good he sleeps.
Boy, you best get up
and get some more.
We over here crackin' teeth,
and this nigger eatin' pork?
You know, a man can share.
You're right.
What's it like
diggin' for the Federals?
It don't seem no different from
diggin' for a master down south.
You seen me ask any man's
permission to leave?
You work hard,
you're your own man.
I don't need no one and
don't look out for no one.
Marcus and I
look out for each other...
ever since the army
burned down the master's farm.
Doin' what it takes to get by.
We's family, you know?
I knew my ma
for about two hours,
and my father was a sumbitch.
Father went north
two years back,
but he's comin' back for me.
Boy, that's bullshit
and you know it.
Comin' back
down south for you...
is the last thing
on the man's mind.
Keep quiet
and let a nigger sleep.
Where you goin'?
I-I got to piss.
Then go right there.
You ain't got to spend 10 minutes standin'
up and then walk a mile out in the woods.
Well?
Well, I can't with you watchin'.
Tsk.
Oh, shit, boy.
Hold on now.
Where you goin'?
- Just hold up now.
- You stole some of my salt pork.
- I'll make my own way from here on.
- Man, I ain't eat your food.
I knowed you was a thief.
You don't know a goddamn thing.
What, you think
I stole that shit?
Why?
You smell it on my breath? Huh?
Huh?
You smell it on my breath?
Come on, nigger.
Teach me a lesson.
Just wait up now.
Come on, boy. Grab the shit.
Let's go.
Take water if you need. The
rest belongs to their kinfolk.
Damn, if you ain't
an uppity nigger.
Slave for the Union
is still just a slave.
- He ain't like other men I seen.
- Yeah.
He's worth more.
And don't you forget.
What if it was you?
Well, it ain't.
Look at me, boy.
Look at me.
You wanna go back
to sellin' tobacco for pennies?
Now,
you can live hand to mouth
for the rest of your life.
Or...
you can make some money.
Maybe even enough
to find your daddy.
Get down, boy.
When I was your age, I was climbin'
like that and broke a leg.
How's it now?
It's fine now.
Well, if it ain't a problem,
I'll keep climbin'.
I always make you mad, don't I?
Can you throw that?
Show me how.
Go on. Climb that tree.
Got any other family?
Besides your brother?
Nothin'?
I had a woman...
not too far from here.
Wasn't no words spoken over us,
but she was my woman.
No children?
We had a child.
Probably be a little older than
you, but he ain't make it.
You don't see her no more?
Best this way.
Got nothin' weighin' me down.
- So what was her name?
- Rachel.
There's a lot of Rachels
out there.
Lord, I known
a lot of Rachels in my day.
Where you say
your Rachel's from?
We rested long enough.
I'll fill this up,
then we'll keep on.
I'll fill it for you.
This'll do for tonight.
Come on. Let's get some wood.
No fire tonight.
We're too far from Union lines
and don't need the attention.
Well, I'm makin' a fire.
If you don't like it, you can
freeze your ass on down the way.
Get up.
Let him be.
The boy's feet ain't good.
Come on now, boy.
You gonna have to be
your own man someday.
Maybe we can do
something nice for him...
'fore we turn him in.
You think you good,
but you ain't.
You'd do the same thing
if you was me.
Can't we just...
ask him for the money
he owe Burrell?
- Huh?
- Goddamn it, boy.
Burrell don't want
money from him.
Nate done killed a man, and Burrell's
gonna kill him to get the bounty.
Now, I'd do it
for the money myself,
but Burrell will kill me
and you both...
if we don't deliver him
exactly how he say.
Stop talkin' to that old man...
'fore he figure us out and we got to kill
him and drag his dead ass all the way back.
This ain't
just about the money.
It's about your life.
Nate's a dead man
and can't nobody help him.
What is it, boy?
You ain't sleepin'?
I can't always sleep neither.
All of a sudden you quiet?
Where's Nate?
Get the boy!
Hyah!
All right. All right.
Get down. All right.
Aaah!
All right, come on.
All right, now,
let's have a look.
Come on.
We'll get you right.
This just
so we ain't slowed down.
You do everything I say
or I'll leave you.
Understand?
Come on. You're all right.
We only got two
or three more nights.
There used to be
some freedmen livin' out here.
We appreciate you havin' us
on such a night.
Your son look hungrier
than you are.
Me and your uncle didn't
always get on well,
but it was kind of him to come
tell me the word about my brother.
He died doin' a good thing.
When the soldiers came,
he tried to save himself.
Why'd you come back for me?
What's your name?
Will.
William.
William sounds old.
They call me Abby,
instead of Abigail.
Who's that man you with?
He kin to you?
Just a man.
Just a man?
That's cold, boy!
You stayin' here?
You should stay here.
Huh?
How come?
Where you goin'?
There ain't much other
children round here.
I ain't children.
Ready?
We gettin' closer now.
I can't be seen in these parts.
All right.
When you throw it,
hold your arm straight out.
Let's see how you do.
Come on.
Come on.
You used a hammer?
Hold it like that.
Lower.
What's wrong with you, boy?
Come on, now.
Pick a tree, not too far.
Boy, what's wrong with you?
Come on. Pick a tree.
Marcus didn't steal
your salt pork.
It was me.
I'd have give it to you
had you asked me.
Nate.
I...
I got to tell you...
If they see us, you just run.
Don't look back.
You got any other family
round Leesville?
When we get back,
what you gonna do?
I do odd jobs for a white man.
I'm savin' up to go look for
my pa if he ain't back soon.
What kind of jobs?
Different things
up and down the Nottoway.
I thought you said
you was from Leesville.
No.
I-I am.
It ain't too far from there.
I saw you talkin'
to that girl back there.
You ever had a girl of your own?
No.
Don't.
They trouble.
Not all of 'em.
Yeah. All of 'em.
But they worth it.
I'm bringin' him.
I done like Burrell said.
We ain't ridin'
with Burrell no more.
Son of a bitch killed Hayden
two days ago.
He ain't right.
We found your boy.
Where you two headed?
I got a brother sick
down in Leesville.
We headed down that way.
Ain't we?
Y'all look to be
in a sorry state.
I ain't like to see men like that...
niggers or not.
Might as well
make our way together.
That's kind,
but we'll be all right.
We'll just keep alongside,
if it suits you.
I don't give a damn
if it suits him.
Stop!
I warned him.
We only got one more night
after this.
So I guess we'll just
make do tomorrow.
You saved me back there.
I was savin' myself.
You had a woman near here?
Yeah.
Y'all ain't never had
another child together?
It ain't always that simple.
But them times was all right.
You ever killed a man
before yesterday?
Mmm.
'Bout six years back,
my master died.
His wife left for Boston
and set me free when she did.
So I headed up north to earn money
to buy out my woman from her master.
But a couple of pattyrollers
tried to take me back.
I showed 'em my papers.
I killed one of 'em.
Maybe I ain't have to,
but I did.
After hidin' out
near five years,
I lost touch with my woman.
She ain't but five miles
down that way... or was.
Probably should've
never left her.
I miss her,
but it can't be helped.
I ain't never told no one
'bout that before.
Why didn't you
send word to her,
tell her what happened?
It ain't safe
knowin' a man like me.
I'd have wanted to know
what happened.
That night before
my father went north,
we fought over somethin'...
what I can't even remember now.
I wish I hadn't done that.
I ain't sure he'd be too
happy to see me these days.
He'd be proud of you.
I got something to say.
If you gotta do something...
you don't want to,
that you know is wrong,
but you ain't got
no choice in it,
are you goin' to hell?
I don't know.
You ain't got no choice,
you ain't got no choice.
Most times, we got a choice.
Nate?
Nate?
Nate!
You thought I left you?
I wouldn't leave you.
But I might
if you don't bathe soon.
Maybe we should stop by
to see your woman.
What?
We gotta keep movin'.
It ain't too far.
Don't talk 'bout that no more.
I don't know
what the hell I'm doin'.
Be quiet.
I should just
head on out of here.
We done decided.
She don't want to see me
after all this time.
And I don't care nohow.
Yes, you do.
Yeah?
There a woman name
of Rachel around here?
Rachel live here.
Sundays she go to town
with the master's wife.
Sometimes they spend the night.
I think she'll
be back this evening.
You was her man?
I's her man now.
I don't think she'd be
wantin' to see you nohow.
I heard about you.
What'd you hear?
Just that you was set free.
You went up north. You never
come back like you said.
She kept these.
I ain't too fond
of lookin' at 'em,
if you want 'em.
She kept them all this time?
I don't know if I's supposed
to give 'em to you.
She kept 'em so long.
A man's boots is a man's boots,
but she might not like me
givin' 'em to you.
I never know what she thinkin'.
Sometime her mood turn,
she let me hear about it.
She used to
let me hear about it.
Sometimes I think the whole county could
hear about it once she got goin'.
Hell, you probably know
all about that too.
Lord knows I sure do.
She's somethin' else.
Hell, you should probably
stay and talk a while.
You probably got all kinds
of stories to tell.
Well, I'll tell her
you come by.
Yeah.
We can wait.
She might be back this evening.
No. We should push on.
We could reach my brother
by tomorrow afternoon.
Rachel.
Now?
Now?
Tell me.
Tell me. All right.
I went up north like I said.
You was supposed
to come back for me.
Why didn't you come back?
You could have
told me something.
So you responsible
for that boy now?
You ain't worth a damn.
Comin' back here now.
Come here, boy.
Look at you... all filthy.
Moth-eaten.
I wouldn't expect no more from him,
but somebody gotta take care of you.
- We been traveling...
- Don't.
Don't talk at me.
I'm all right.
You all right?
He ain't got nobody?
If he ain't got nobody, just leave
him here till they figure somethin'.
I... I got people.
You got people.
Kin?
Lord.
You sure you ain't his son?
'Cause you
just as much trouble.
We should get on now.
Don't make me no difference.
What's wrong?
We need to eat.
There's stores
at the crossroads.
Some sell to Negroes.
I can't be seen up there.
This is just enough to get us
hardtack and venison for tonight.
I'll be here.
Be careful.
This too?
This ain't enough.
You got whiskey?
What's all this?
So you ain't too cold.
You spent your pa's
double eagle?
I'll give this to my brother.
It could be a comfort to him.
Drink some now.
We made it, didn't we?
I don't know about seeing my
brother after all this time.
I don't know.
Things ain't always happen the
way they supposed to with him.
Or with me.
I ain't really lived
like I should.
I've wasted time.
And it ain't always
been my fault.
But I'm gonna do what I need to,
and things gonna be better.
I'm gonna be better.
What you think about that?
You want to hold it?
You can keep it till mornin'.
You know,
I got a little saved up.
After I take care of my brother,
we can go back north...
and look for your father.
you want.
Hell, even if
we don't find him,
you can travel with me
long as you want.
We can go out west.
Things supposed to be
different out there.
Maybe I could do for you
what no one done for me.
Ain't no point
goin' it alone, really.
What you think about that?
Huh?
Well, you think about it.
I was just thinking about you.
Y'all get held up?
Marcus ain't make it.
Yeah, I heard.
When we ride up,
he best be waitin' for me.
But I know he will...
'cause you're coming with us.
He's here.
I couldn't get his knife.
Give me an hour.
I'll get it.
We should get movin' soon.
Come on, now.
Ain't no wind today.
Should be warmer.
Boy, what's wrong with you?
Huh?
Speak up.
Speak up.
I want to get to my brother
before dark.
Y-Your brother's dead.
We was supposed to bring you
for bounty hunters.
They were gonna kill you
for the money.
They said they'd kill us
if we didn't bring you.
You got to go far from here.
You ain't deserve none of this.
They're comin'!
They're here! We got to run or fight.
We gotta go.
Will?
Come on out now.
Let us do what we come for.
Or else we can do you too.
Nothin' gonna happen to you.
- You gonna be all right.
- Other side!
Go round back. Go on now!
Give me your other knife.
Will?
This ain't your fault, son.
You ain't like them.
You risked your own skin
by tellin' me.
I'm proud of you.
Leave that there
so they see it.
You go north now.
Take Rachel to them people in
the swamp till this war's over.
Then you go find your pa.
I'll catch up with you.
If I don't,
you give half that to Rachel.
- No!
No!
No!
Nate!
You done good.
You done good.
You're free to go.
Don't follow us
if you want to live.
