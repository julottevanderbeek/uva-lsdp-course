Very efficient stage line.
Right on time.
Take a look, Matt.
We're right on schedule.
It's a little crowded here.
- Hi, Marty. Got the manifest?
- Here, Ben.
It's about dinnertime, Laurie.
You go ahead, Dad.
I'll check this bill and be right along.
Fine, honey.
Cool them off
before you feed them, Randolph.
Nice little town, huh?
- Your passbook, Marshal?
- I've got it.
Never mind, Mrs. Cain.
You can bring it in next time.
Why, I have it. Here you are.
- There you are, Marshal.
- Thank you, Arthur.
Don't move, mister. And no noise.
All right, do as you're told and be quiet.
Come on.
Over there.
You heard him. Against the wall.
Hello, Ben.
Hello there, Marshal Cain.
How are you, young lady?
Young lady?
I don't believe you're well, Ben Cutler.
- Never felt better in my life, Mollie.
- Maybe just a little nervous.
Me? Look at that: Steady as a rock.
I want to see you do that
two weeks from tomorrow.
- I'll do it.
- No, you won't.
You'll probably keel over
in a dead faint at the altar.
All you big, strong men are alike.
Where are you and Ruth
going on your honeymoon? Lincoln?
Now, Mollie.
- You promise not to tell, Mollie?
- I won't.
- China.
- All right. I'll find out.
- She will, too, Ben. I guarantee it.
- Well, not from me she won't.
You'll be happy, Ben.
You both deserve happiness so much.
Thank you, Mollie.
I declare!
It's a good thing you're getting married.
Kissing women in the middle of the street.
- Right in front of their own husbands.
- Only you, Mollie.
You better keep your eye on her
for the next couple of weeks.
As long as I'm a bachelor, she's in danger.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Ben.
Now get in the back and open the big box.
Matt.
I think you better open it.
- Good day. Something in a dress for you?
- Yes, ma'am. You.
- How are you, sweetheart?
- Fine. Oh, the biscuits.
- Is Laurie coming for lunch?
- She'll be along.
Look at that pie. Apple, isn't it?
Bean soup. Golden fried chicken.
I always thought when a man was in love
that he lost his appetite.
I'm disillusioned.
You're marrying me for my cooking.
Absolutely. What are you marrying me for?
- I honestly don't know.
- Here, I'll show you.
Mom, lunch ready? I'm starving.
Midge, take that noisy beast out of here!
And take your hat off! I'm yelling.
And wash up for lunch. And you, too, Ben.
Eddie?
- Eddie Campbell!
- Hi, Laurie.
Hi. When did you come back?
Just a little while ago.
Just passing through.
I was gonna drop by
and say hello before I left.
Well, I should think so.
Somebody out there talking to Eddie.
Frank, cover them.
You look well, Eddie.
Thanks. You do, too.
You promised to write me, you know.
I haven't had a letter
from you in over two years.
Well, you know how it is.
Damn Kid!
Look, I've got to meet this man here
in a few minutes...
and I'd rather be alone.
I have to go anyway. I'm late already.
Don't you forget your promise now.
Goodbye, Eddie.
That's enough. Let's get out!
Wait a minute! Let's not rush it.
You're trying to keep secrets from us?
You'll never make it out of Springdale.
- It's a holdup!
- Midge!
Midge! Come here.
Marshal! Where's the Marshal?
He just got one of them.
Come on!
Come on, let's go!
George, they got Frank.
Head up there to that draw.
Dad! Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right, honey. Midge.
Go get Dr. Paul and tell him to come over
to the jail right away.
Yes, sir.
Is it Hiram who's hurt?
It's Hiram, Mollie.
He won't hurt anymore.
I always knew this would be the way
it would happen someday...
and so did you.
Would you take him home, please?
Give her a little time alone.
Untie the Kid and put him in a cell.
One of them is still alive? Too bad.
Not for long.
He's the one that killed Marshal Cain.
The others got away.
At least they didn't get away
with all the money.
The one you nailed
was carrying about half of it.
- Get back, please.
- Eddie!
It's Eddie.
Ben, let's go get cleaned up.
Paul, he isn't going to...
Die? I don't think so.
How soon will you...
When he wakes up,
should he be given something to eat?
If he's hungry, yes.
I'll be in my office.
The bullet grazed his scalp.
I don't think it caused any concussion.
He should come out of it
in a couple of hours.
Thanks, Paul.
Come on, Laurie.
Avery, can you and Moore stay here
for a while?
Try to get somebody to relieve you.
- He won't be going anywhere.
- No. Not by himself he won't.
But his friends might take the notion
to come back and try to get him.
Anyway, I'd keep the doors bolted,
and don't let anybody in you don't know.
Don't worry.
How soon will he be well enough
to hang, Ben?
Yeah.
A judge and a jury
will decide his punishment, not you.
Why waste the time?
We all know what he did.
I don't figure justice is a waste of time...
and I think most of the folks around here
feel the same way.
- I'll go home and get supper started, Dad.
- I'll be along in a minute, honey.
She'll be all right, Ben.
I wish I could keep her from
getting hurt too much.
You ought to eat something.
I can't.
Listen to me, honey.
There's one thing you've got to face.
Eddie Campbell isn't the same youngster
you grew up with and liked so much.
He's a man now, a dangerous man.
He killed Hiram Cain.
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, he did.
You know what that means.
It means a trial, a sentence,
and an execution.
Don't talk like that, Dad.
Honey, don't torture yourself like this.
Don't try to believe he's innocent
when he's guilty.
Whatever they do to him,
I'll never believe him guilty.
He's bad, yes. But he didn't kill anyone.
- I know him.
- I know him, too, Laurie. I know that...
It's Paul.
- Hello, Ben.
- Have you had your supper?
I've eaten, thanks.
- Hi, Laurie.
- Hello.
It's a very nice night.
I thought you might like to go for a walk.
Come on. A walk will do you good.
You can do the dishes later. Come on.
Good evening, Laurie, Doc.
Is your dad at home?
There he is.
Ben, we'd like to talk to you.
Come in, boys.
- Sit down?
- No, thanks.
You know why we're here I'm sure.
This was Marshal Cain's badge.
We'd like you to wear it.
I haven't worn a badge since...
It was just after Laurie was born,
almost 20 years.
I wish you'd get somebody else, Harry.
We need you, Ben. The whole town does.
You've had the experience...
and you'll be obeyed.
You already proved that this afternoon.
It don't have to be permanent, Ben.
Just till after the trial.
Would you like to think it over
until tomorrow?
No, I guess not.
I couldn't think my way out of this anyway.
Thanks, Ben. Now where's your Bible?
Anybody remember the oath?
- Well, let's see...
- I do.
"I hereby swear to uphold
and enforce the laws of this community...
"of the United States of America,
so help me, God."
It's a very nice night.
What were you crying about before?
I'd rather not talk about it, Paul.
It'll only lead to an argument.
I don't want that.
Laurie, there's some things I have to say.
I can't keep them
bottled up inside me any longer.
I love you.
I don't know why I never said so before.
I just never got around to it, I guess.
But you've known it, haven't you?
I want you to marry me, Laurie.
- I don't know what to say, Paul.
- Just say you will, that's all.
I can't. Not now. Not yet.
You're not in love with Eddie Campbell.
- I don't know.
- You're sorry for him but you don't love him.
- You couldn't love a man like that.
- Maybe I can.
I'm sorry I had to be the one
to patch him up.
It's hard being the only doctor in town.
But the job has its compensations.
When they hang him, I'll be the one
to pronounce him officially dead.
You tell me you love me...
and then, in the same breath,
you tear me apart with those awful words.
You don't love me.
You couldn't love anybody.
There's too much hate in you!
We are gathered here
in the sight of our Lord...
to lay to rest
the body of our beloved friend...
Hiram Cain.
"Man is born of woman
and hath but a short time to live..."
It's the Kid, Ben. He tore off his bandages.
He's bleeding pretty bad.
"In the midst of life we are in death.
"Earth to earth...
"ashes to ashes...
"dust to dust."
- Hold his head.
- Why can't you just let me die?
'Cause you're gonna stand trial.
You'll stay alive
if I have to keep you tied up every minute.
No, you won't! I'm not gonna hang!
I'll find a way to die!
Eddie, please, don't!
Laurie, baby, I'm sorry.
If he's looking for a way to die...
he's gonna have to find
a better one than that.
His wound's not anywhere near that serious.
Furthermore, I think he knows it.
- Good evening, Mr. Avery.
- Evening, Laurie.
Wait a minute, Laurie.
I don't think you ought to be here.
- Is he conscious?
- Has been most of the day.
We tried to get him to eat something
a while ago...
but he wouldn't take it.
Hi, Laurie.
Open the cell, would you, please?
I brought you a clean shirt
and something to eat.
- I'm not hungry.
- Maybe this will change your mind.
It's beef broth I made.
- Father tell you to bring it?
- No, Eddie.
Help keep me alive so I can hang?
Eddie, please don't talk like that.
If you do, I'll have to go and I don't want to.
I don't want you to, either.
Will you eat my soup?
Please, Mr. Avery.
You'll be good, won't you, Eddie?
- Promise?
- Promise.
- Can you eat by yourself?
- I think so.
It's good. Wonderful.
- You're awfully good to me, Laurie.
- It's because I believe in you.
- I know you couldn't kill anyone.
- Yeah?
You're the only one who believes that.
It's true, though, isn't it?
Yes, it's true. I didn't shoot that marshal.
One of the others must have.
Your father knows I didn't do it.
He saw the killing.
It really doesn't make
any difference, though...
- because I don't have a chance.
- Yes, you do.
How do you figure that, Laurie?
There won't be one man on that jury
that wasn't a friend of Marshal Cain's.
But they're good people.
Honest people.
If you tell them the truth, they'll believe you.
I know they will.
Laurie, it is the truth.
I helped with the bank holdup
and I stood guard. But I didn't kill anybody.
I believe you.
It's funny that that's almost enough.
I mean, you believing me.
Will you come back soon, Laurie?
Yes, I will.
He doesn't have to be handcuffed anymore.
- Good night, Eddie.
- Good night, Laurie.
Sleep well.
Lock up after me.
I'm gonna go see Ben
about leaving the cuffs off the Kid.
Could you tell me where the jail is?
I understand you're holding
Edward Campbell. I'd like to see him.
Sorry, mister. Nobody gets in here
without the Marshal's permission.
And where would I find him?
There, he's coming now.
- Are you the marshal?
- That's right.
My name is Selby, William Selby.
I'm here to see Edward Campbell.
What for?
Apparently, you don't know who I am.
Apparently, I don't.
"William P. Selby. Attorney at law."
- What do you want to see Campbell about?
- His defense, of course.
Did the Governor appoint you
defense counsel?
- He did not.
- Then who retained you?
I don't think his identity
is any business of yours, Marshal.
If your private party
happens to be a fugitive from justice...
then it is my business.
I didn't come all the way from Lincoln
to argue with you.
Your prisoner is entitled by law
to consult with his counsel...
and you know it.
All right, Mr. Selby.
But I don't want you discussing this case
with any citizen of Springdale.
They're all prospective jurors.
Let him in, Avery.
Thank you very much.
Come in.
- Hi, Ruth.
- Hi, Ben. You're early.
- You going over to the jail again?
- Yes.
I've told you the county furnishes meals
for prisoners.
It's only a little cake and coffee.
You gotta see the food they send over
from the lunchroom. It's just terrible.
Maybe the cook over at the lunchroom
isn't sympathetic enough.
I'll have to go over and have a talk with him.
If I had any sense,
I wouldn't let her go over there to see him.
- That'd just make her wanna see him more.
- Yeah, I know.
- She thinks the boy is innocent.
- He's not innocent. He's guilty.
You're in a terrible mood, Ben.
I just ran into a character
by the name of William P. Selby.
He's an attorney at law. He came
all the way from Lincoln to defend the Kid.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Surely you can't object to it
if he has legal help?
I can if it's being paid for with money
stolen from the Springdale Bank.
- You have no proof of that.
- Where else would it come from?
Ben, you are so prejudiced
against this boy...
that your whole outlook
on the case is distorted.
Just what does that mean?
I think you're afraid
that this lawyer may convince the jury...
that he's not guilty.
That's strange talk coming from you.
A woman whose husband was killed
by the same kind of man...
- as Eddie Campbell.
- That's not true.
Eddie is just a boy.
Tom was killed by a hardened criminal.
You think this kid is any less hardened?
Since when is a young rattlesnake
any less poisonous than an old one?
I wish you hadn't accepted that badge.
It has changed you.
No, it hasn't, Ruth.
I shouldn't have talked to you like that.
There was no reason for it. I'm sorry.
Come on, then, and help me fix supper.
- What about his parents?
- We all knew his folks.
His father died
when he was just a youngster...
and his mother was pretty sickly.
So he left school
to start cow-punching to support his ma.
He couldn't have been over 14 then.
I see. How old was he
when his mother passed away?
It was two or three years after that.
He left Springdale then,
and we just don't know where he went.
Here. Drink up, gentlemen.
Hello, Ben.
Well, good evening, Marshal.
You care to have a drink?
No, thanks.
Mr. Selby, I warned you
about discussing this case.
I have a right to ask questions
about my client's background.
I'm a stranger here, you know.
If any of you are picked for jury duty...
I'll see that
the State Attorney challenges you.
You've got no call to talk that way, Ben.
Are you saying we can be influenced by...
I'm not saying you can be.
I'm saying the attempt is being made.
Would you kindly explain that remark?
You're buying drinks
for the town's most respected citizens.
You're discussing
Campbell's unfortunate childhood.
If that's not an attempt to influence jurors...
I don't know what you'd call it.
You're way out of line, Ben.
The gentleman
has just expressed my sentiments.
I'll add this, Marshal.
I've run across a lot of men
who turned bloodthirsty...
as soon as they're given the badge,
but you're the worst I've ever seen.
You can't wait to hang this boy, can you?
Mr. Selby, you're a guest in this town.
I suggest you behave like one.
You're mistaken. I'm no guest, Marshal.
I'm here to do a job and I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna free an innocent boy
that you want to hang for personal reasons.
I know all about Eddie Campbell
and your daughter.
I know that she...
You show great courage, Marshal...
with that badge and that gun.
What's got into Ben anyway?
I never saw him get this mad before.
Like the man said, maybe it's the badge.
No badge, no gun.
Dad!
Ben!
Come on, Uncle Ben!
Nice fight, Ben.
See that our guest
gets up to his hotel room.
Midge, go find Dr. Paul.
- Tell him to take a look at Mr. Selby.
- Yes, sir.
Give us a hand here, boys.
Would you go upstairs?
Would you go upstairs?
In the medicine cabinet,
I think there's some liniment up there.
Ruth, I'm all right.
I might be a little tender in spots
for a week, but...
You know something?
I feel better than I did.
I think I got some of the edginess
knocked out of me.
Men are lucky.
Women can't do things like that.
- I just wish that...
- Now, don't go wishing you were a man.
I've got enough trouble.
Come in.
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hello, Ruth.
- Hi, Paul.
- Hi, Ben.
I came to see if you needed
a little patching up, too.
No, thanks. I'm all right. Nothing broken.
Just badly bent.
- What about the liniment?
- I won't need that. Thanks.
I just came from Selby's room.
Must have been quite a brawl.
I'm sorry I missed it.
- Did me a lot of good.
- Sure.
I found it.
- Hello, Laurie.
- Hello, Doctor.
- Look why don't you two stop...
- I think I'll go home now, Father.
Any time she calls me "Father"
that means trouble.
But don't worry, Paul.
It'll all turn out all right.
- Come on, I'll walk till the jail with you.
- All right.
Thanks, honey.
- See you later, Paul.
- Ben, a man waiting to see you inside.
- Joslin's his name.
- Tallant Joslin?
I think that's what he said.
He's State Attorney.
He must have come in for the trial.
- Hello, Tal.
- Hello, Ben.
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you.
- Have you been waiting long?
- Just a few minutes.
- So they sent you down to prosecute?
- That's right.
- What happened to your face, Ben?
- I ran into a door.
- Really? Anybody I know?
- I'm sure you must know him.
He's an attorney.
A character named William P. Selby.
No!
So he's here for the defense,
I might have known it.
I shouldn't have gotten into a fight with him.
- But he just rubbed me the wrong way.
- He has a special faculty for that.
Besides, I'm sure
the Kid's bank robber friends hired him.
Possibly, but not necessarily.
This is the first murder trial
we've had in this state in a long time.
It's going to attract a lot of attention,
and Selby's a politician.
I understand
that he's after the governor's job.
- Him?
- Yeah.
The Governor sent his regards, by the way.
He said he knew justice would be done
with you wearing the marshal's star.
- That was nice of him. How is John?
- He's fine.
All right. Now what about
this Edward Campbell?
He's guilty.
Who were the witnesses?
Besides me,
there were six others in the posse.
Did any of you see the actual shooting?
I saw it. I'm sure the others did, too.
Tal, you can do me a big favor.
Keep me off the stand if you can, will you?
- Why?
- It's my daughter Laurie.
She and this Kid,
sort of, were brought up together...
and she was fond of him at one time.
She thinks he's innocent.
- lf I had to testify and be the one who...
- Yes, I understand.
- I'll do what I can.
- Thanks. I'd appreciate it.
About these other witnesses,
what were their names?
There was William Avery, Ed Moore...
Stan Winslow and his brother Bert.
Just a moment. Back up a little.
- Where are you?
- Winslow.
- Stan Winslow, yeah, and his brother Bert.
- Bert Winslow.
Tracy, this is Alfred.
I'm sorry, folks! Standing room's all filled.
Close the door.
It's better than the state fair.
Bring him out.
Here they come!
How about a drink, Marshal?
Don't worry, Kid. You'll get off.
Sit here.
Not yet. Wait till the Judge comes in.
Hear ye, hear ye,
this court is now in session.
The Honorable John R. Frazier,
Judge, presiding.
Court is now convened.
Counselors, please take their seats.
Will the State's attorney
please begin the proceedings?
Your Honor, gentlemen of the jury...
"the State intends to prove the following:
"That on the afternoon of June 12, 1878...
"the defendant, Edward Campbell...
"did deliberately commit
the crime of murder...
"on the person of Marshal Hiram Cain...
"citizen and law officer
of the city of Springdale, Nebraska.
"The facts are simple and clear-cut.
"When the State is finished
presenting the evidence...
"I'm absolutely positive
that your verdict will be guilty as charged...
"and justice will be done."
Yes, sir. We was going pretty fast.
- At full gallop?
- Yes, sir.
Now, a few minutes ago, you testified
under the questionings of Mr. Joslin here...
that you thought you saw Edward Campbell
kill Marshal Cain.
You also testified
that you were the last member of the posse.
Now with the confusion of the horses...
and the dust
between you and the defendant...
and the dead Marshal at your feet...
Marshal Cutler dismounted and
the horses of the posse rushing past him...
isn't it possible that at a hundred yards,
in the confusion of the dust...
you could have been wrong?
Yes, I guess so.
Don't guess.
Tell the jury what you swore to tell them.
The truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.
Did you see with your own eyes
the defendant commit murder?
Well, I saw what I thought
could maybe be him.
Yes or no, Mr. Moore. No maybes.
This is a murder trial.
Well...
No.
Order.
The State calls William Avery.
William Avery to the stand.
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth...
- nothing but the truth?
- Yes, sir.
- State your name.
- William Avery.
Take the stand.
Mr. Avery, it's been established...
that during the gunfight
that resulted in the death of Marshal Cain...
only one of the outlaws was firing.
Is that correct?
Yes, sir.
- Did you see the man who did the shooting?
- Yes, sir.
- Who was it?
- It was the defendant.
Your witness, sir.
Mr. Avery, you've been in the court...
while the previous five witnesses
were testifying, haven't you?
Yes, sir.
I know that you have a good memory...
but with your permission,
I would like to refresh it a bit.
So far, none of the five men
who accompanied you in the posse...
have been able to positively identify
which of the three outlaws...
actually did the shooting of Marshal Cain.
Now do you recall that testimony?
- Yes.
- Good.
Now I want you to tell the court
and the jury...
if you think that your vision is any better
than that of the other five witnesses.
No better, but just as good.
All right.
Now tell the jury...
which one of the outlaws
killed Marshal Cain.
Like the others said, from where I was...
it looked like it was the Kid, the defendant.
It looked?
Now these 12 men
are not interested in guesses.
They want facts.
Now, once again...
and this time, I want you to be
absolutely sure of your answer.
A man's life depends
upon your testimony, Mr. Avery.
Which one of the outlaws was it?
If you put it that way,
I just can't say for sure.
- No more questions.
- You may step down.
They've got no case, son.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to put you
on the stand.
The State calls Marshal Ben Cutler.
Marshal Cutler to the stand.
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth...
- nothing but the truth?
- I do.
- Your name?
- Ben Cutler.
Take the stand.
Would you please give us
your version of the shooting?
Hiram Cain was the first man
to follow the bank robbers out of town.
I was next, maybe 20 yards behind him.
The rest of the posse followed.
Now the outlaws made a stand
at the top of the hill.
Well, you've heard all that.
The posse was swinging up the draw
when Hiram Cain was killed.
Now, maybe, for certain reasons...
the other men in the posse
can't identify the killer.
I can.
You can? Is he here in this courtroom?
Yes, he is.
- The defendant, Edward Campbell.
- Your witness, sir.
Marshal Cutler, isn't it true...
that your daughter and Eddie Campbell
were childhood sweethearts?
Objection.
Your Honor, the Marshal's personal life
has nothing to do with this case.
Objection sustained.
Stick to the facts, Mr. Selby.
You know better.
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Marshal, were you on foot or mounted
when the shooting occurred?
- I was on foot.
- Really? How did that occur?
My horse was shot from under me.
- Then you must have fallen.
- I fell.
- I trust you weren't hurt.
- I wasn't hurt.
Gentlemen, most of us have fallen...
or been thrown from a horse
sometime during our lives.
It shakes a man up.
With most men, it takes a while
even to know what day it is.
But not the Marshal.
He's a pretty rugged man.
Marshal, how close were you
to the outlaws...
when you finally landed in the dirt?
- I'd say about 50 yards.
- About?
That's what I said. About.
Fifty yards.
Shaken up from having been thrown
from a horse at full gallop...
with the posse horses
thundering all around...
and you can still positively identify...
the outlaw who shot Marshal Cain?
- I can.
- How?
Because only one of them was shooting
when Hiram Cain was hit.
I saw his face very plainly.
It was Edward Campbell.
I shot him, knocked him off his horse.
When I got up to where he was lying,
I turned him over.
He was lying face down.
It was still Edward Campbell.
Jury's coming in.
Everybody, please rise.
Be seated, please.
Gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?
- We have, Your Honor.
- What is your verdict?
We find him guilty as charged.
The defendant will please rise.
Have you anything to say
before this court pronounces sentence?
Your Honor...
I've known Marshal Cutler
almost all my life...
and I know he's honest.
He thinks he saw me
shoot down Marshal Cain...
so he had to say so.
I don't blame him for that.
Not a bit.
But I didn't do it.
I swear I didn't.
I admit I did wrong.
I helped Frank to...
I helped rob the bank,
and I ought to be punished for that...
but I couldn't kill anybody.
I just couldn't.
I had all the chance in the world...
if I could have killed somebody,
to kill Marshal Cutler...
but I didn't.
I deliberately shot at his horse instead.
That's all.
I mean, that's when I quit shooting.
One of the others
must have killed Marshal Cain.
I swore...
that I'd never beg for anything.
But I'm begging now...
for my life...
and for a second chance...
because I never really had a first one.
Edward Campbell...
it is the sentence of this court
that on the morning of June 20...
in the year of 1878,
between the hours of 7:00 and 10:00 a. m...
you shall be hanged by the neck until dead.
Marshal.
Court stands adjourned.
- Everything all right in there, Ed?
- Yes, fine.
That lawyer fellow was here looking for you.
Said he'd wait in the saloon.
Thanks.
Hello, Tal.
Greetings, Ben.
What are you doing in here?
Two things, in the order of their importance.
One: Getting drunk.
Two: Waiting to talk to you.
I thought you were going out
on the afternoon stage.
I told you I wanted to see you.
Where you been?
Out in God's clean, clear country...
where a man can be alone
with his tortured soul?
Wish I enjoyed riding a horse.
Never had much use for it.
Two inches per hour.
When I'm imbibing with
true intoxication in mind, that's my rate.
You can set your watch by it.
That's my hourglass. Go on, help yourself.
Bartender, have another glass?
You can save yourself time
by drinking faster, Tal.
Not and keep my dignity, Ben.
I need that. I need it worse
every time I send somebody to the gallows.
Tal, here's to you.
I came to talk to you about the execution.
- We don't have to talk about that, do we?
- But we do.
There hasn't been a hanging in Nebraska
in a long time.
There have been
some new ordinances passed.
Like what?
Like you can't take a man out to a tall tree...
stand him on a barrel anymore.
I know that.
- A gallows has to be built.
- That's right.
And here...
Here are the measurements.
Also a tight, high board fence.
- A fence?
- To ensure privacy.
A public execution is held to constitute...
a cruel and unusual punishment.
Three official witnesses...
you, the doctor, and one other.
Let's talk about something else.
How's the family?
They're fine. Boy's in law school.
Girl's married to a young rancher.
She's going to make me
a grandfather any day.
That's fine.
Yeah.
I'm a very happy man.
Hello, Ruth.
I've been waiting for you.
- Weren't you coming over?
- Yes, I was, Ruth.
I'm sorry, I just didn't think
I'd be very good company tonight.
You're not going to do it.
Hang him?
- Somebody has to.
- But not you.
Who then?
Anybody. It doesn't matter, Ben,
but not you.
Look, if somebody came along
and offered to do it for me...
I'd give him a month's salary, gladly.
Two months'.
Nobody's going to.
But, Ben, think of Laurie.
I do think of her, every minute.
You could take that badge off
and throw it in the dirt...
and walk away from it,
and no one would blame you.
No one but me.
Is your pride worth more to you
than your daughter?
It's not just pride, Ruth.
It's a lot of other things all mixed together.
It's the oath I took on the Bible...
the land I live in and love...
but mostly it's a matter
of justice and the law.
I happen to believe in them.
Enough to make you an executioner?
Ruth, try to understand. I've got to do it.
You want to do it!
You've wanted that boy's life
ever since you brought him in here!
Don't talk like an idiot!
Ben, I just thought of something very funny.
The day of the hanging, June 20th...
that's the day
we were supposed to get married.
- Isn't that a big joke?
- Ruth, listen to me.
What were you planning to do?
Walk from the gallows to the church...
and have me there waiting for you?
I'm home, Laurie.
You going someplace, honey?
To Ruth's. I can't live in this house
with you anymore.
- Listen to me...
- Don't touch me.
You're my daughter.
You're going to live in my home.
You can't keep me here.
Not unless you handcuff me,
and lock me up like Eddie.
I suppose you could do that
if you wanted to.
Laurie, listen to me.
It's only on your account
that Eddie's gonna die.
Couldn't you be wrong?
The whole town thinks so,
and I think so, too!
- Good afternoon, Mollie.
- Good afternoon, Ben.
How's my girl been?
The same, Ben, the same.
- But pull up a chair.
- No, I'll sit right here, Mollie.
Hiram and I used to sit here together.
Very pleasant.
I expected you, Ben.
Mollie, I came to borrow
some of your strength.
Nonsense. You don't need it.
You're one of the strongest men
I've ever known.
No, not inside, Mollie.
I've got to hang that boy.
Yes.
Hiram had to do such things.
I know the kind of man he was.
He must have needed your help, too.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you cry.
Forgive me.
Nonsense.
There's nothing to forgive.
A woman cries, she was meant to.
A man can get drunk and get into fights...
but a woman can cry. It's good.
I cry for my man who's gone...
and I cry for that boy...
with the terrible thing inside him
that made him kill.
But mostly, I cry for you, Ben...
because you can't do it yourself.
There, you see, I feel better.
You've made me feel better, too, Mollie.
Not better, but stronger,
like I knew you would.
I don't know why exactly, but you have.
Hiram used to say that.
You're a wise woman, Mollie.
Just an old one.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
By the way,
I deposited $3,000 in your bank account.
You what?
The reward for Matt Fletcher.
The check came in the mail today.
- Now, Ben, that's yours.
- Don't argue with me, Mollie.
You know I'm too pigheaded for you to win.
Softheaded, you mean.
- That sounds more like my girl. Goodbye.
- Bye, Ben.
All right, hand me up a piece of board there.
Those two men sure know
what they're doing, all right.
Yeah, there's a pair of ghouls
if I ever saw them.
- Where did Ben Cutler dig them up?
- From state prison.
He couldn't get anybody
around here to build a gallows...
so he had to import some experts.
It ain't right letting the Kid watch.
Ben ought to cover that window
or something.
No, not Ben.
Personally, I think
he's enjoying this whole thing.
- Hello, Ben.
- Morning.
- Mr. McKinnon!
- Howdy, Marshal.
- How about the fence?
- In good time, Marshal.
I told you I wanted the fence built first.
We might as well finish the gallows,
since we got this far.
Start on the fence right now!
Take a good look at his left-front shoe.
Hello, Paul.
- Takes a lot of work to hang a man.
- Yeah.
They're making a sideshow out of it.
Looks like it's fixing to rain.
No, not for a week, maybe 10 days.
Friday will be a good day for the hanging.
I'm not so sure.
Do you see that line of low clouds yonder?
You'll have to move some of those wagons
off the main street.
You're blocking the way.
- Sure thing, Marshal.
- Glad to oblige, Marshal.
If you've all come here to see the hanging...
you're going to be disappointed.
There's gonna be a high fence
around the gallows.
What do you know about that?
And I drove nearly 100 miles to see it, too.
Hello, Eddie.
Eddie, I wish I could help you.
I've a lot of reasons why I don't wanna die...
and you're the main reason.
- I love you, Laurie. I always have.
- Eddie!
Baby.
I want you to do something for me.
- Anything!
- All right, then.
I want you to come back here tomorrow...
and I want you to bring me a gun.
- Will you do that for me, please?
- Eddie, no.
Please, will you do that for me?
All right.
I wouldn't trade places with him
for a million dollars.
Me, neither.
It'd be bad enough to have to hang a man
who's guilty, but...
You don't think the Kid did it?
I was in that posse, remember?
I couldn't tell who did it.
Reasonable doubt,
that's what they call it. Reasonable doubt.
If there's that, a man shouldn't be hung.
I'll tell you,
I've done a lot of mean things in my time...
all of us have...
but I never swore on a Bible
I was telling the truth when I wasn't.
You saying Ben Cutler was lying?
I'm saying I was in that posse
and I couldn't tell.
Of course, if I had a daughter
who was sweet on a convict...
maybe my eyesight would be better.
- He's got a point.
- Yeah, that's right.
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi.
Boy, oh, boy,
I've been around a pretty long time...
met a lot of people, all kinds...
but I never made such a mistake
about a man before.
You think Campbell's innocent, too?
- I'm sure of it.
- I don't know.
I don't know if he's guilty, either...
and I don't think Ben knows.
Listen, we're the County Commissioners.
We appointed him marshal.
We can fire him, too.
No, that wouldn't help.
First of all, we couldn't find anybody else
right away.
Second, even if we could...
the hanging would
have to take place anyway.
The Kid was sentenced to death, remember?
Yeah, on Ben Cutler's testimony.
Tell you what we could do.
We could start up a petition for clemency.
Practically the whole town would sign it.
- You think that would do any good?
- Couldn't hurt.
Hi, Uncle Ben.
Hello, Midge.
Little late for you to be out, isn't it?
I've been wanting to talk to you.
I saw you come in here.
Let's go out and talk in the corral.
- How has Alfred been, Midge?
- All right.
Come on, sit up here.
How's your mother and Laurie?
Fine, I guess.
Uncle Ben, you and Mom...
you're not gonna get married now, are you?
No, it doesn't look that way, Midge.
I wanted you to be my dad.
I wanted that more than anything
in the whole world.
Thanks, Midge.
But I'll always think of you
as my boy. I promise you that.
When I grow up, I'm gonna make you
proud of me, Uncle Ben.
Just as proud as if I were your very own.
- I'm sure you will, Midge.
- I'm gonna be like you.
Just like you. I'm gonna be a lawman.
No, Midge, I wouldn't want you to do that.
There are a lot of other things you could be.
You've seen what can happen
to a man with a badge.
I wouldn't be afraid.
No, I know you wouldn't be afraid, Midge.
But there are a lot of things worse than fear.
Much worse.
I know what you mean, but I'd do
what I had to do just like you...
even if everybody was against me, too.
Midge, you've got a few years
to think about it.
Maybe you'll change your mind.
You better run along home.
Your mom will be wondering about you.
Thanks for coming to see me.
Good night, Uncle Ben.
Good night, Midge.
- Who is it?
- Ben Cutler.
Hello, boys.
Why don't you go get your dinner?
I'll take over for a while.
- Seen the paper, Ben?
- Thanks.
It's your girl.
Wait a minute, Avery.
Aren't you gonna inspect that basket
before you let it go in the cell?
Ben, it's your own daughter...
Doesn't make any difference. I want
everything checked before it goes in there.
Okay.
Ben!
Who did you want to see dead?
Mr. Avery? Mr. Moore? Me?
He wouldn't have killed anyone.
- You're sure of that?
- Yes, he's not like you!
He couldn't take a human life.
She's not to be allowed to come in here
anymore. Do you understand?
This gun's not loaded.
Sit down, Ben, please.
Well. How are you, Ruth?
Fine.
And how's Laurie?
She's feeling sorry for herself...
but she'll get over it.
A good spanking is what she deserves.
Don't look so surprised.
I'm not always as stupid
as I was the other night.
I didn't mean what I said. Not any of it.
Except the part about wanting you to resign.
I can't, Ruth.
- I know, Ben.
- And you don't care?
Of course I care.
But I still love you.
And that's the only thing that matters.
Got a petition for you here, Marshal.
Two hundred and twelve signatures.
Almost every voter in Springdale...
wants Campbell's sentence
commuted to imprisonment.
If you expect me to make it unanimous,
you're talking to the wrong man.
We don't need your signature.
We want you to take it
to the Governor at Lincoln.
Why me?
Because you're the only one
who knows him well.
Somebody else might not get in
before it's too late.
If he turns it down...
you can still get back
in plenty of time for your hanging.
It's wrong. The whole thing's just wrong.
I've got a long ride ahead of me.
I better get started.
- What time is it?
- Relax, Kid.
Ben will be back in plenty of time.
Here.
No, thanks.
It's only about 10:00.
More than likely,
Ben's on his way back right now.
You think the Governor
will stop the hanging?
No doubt about it.
That petition represents a lot of votes...
including Moore's and mine.
And I tell you one thing...
he ain't gonna be forgotten by this town.
He's a good governor.
You gotta admit that, a good governor.
- Good evening, Doc.
- Hello, Doc.
- You're drunk, Avery.
- Why don't you tell Ben about it?
Maybe he'll fire us.
- Here, Doc, have a drink.
- No, thanks.
Look, Doc, we know how you feel.
It's too bad about you and Ben's daughter.
Those things happen sometimes.
You just gotta make the best of them.
Sure.
Listen.
- There's somebody in the corral.
- No, the horses are just restless.
I'm going out to look. Lock up behind me.
Over against the wall.
You, turn around.
Hello, Kid.
George, I was wondering
when you were coming.
It's like shooting fish in a barrel, huh, Kid?
There's a half a dozen of them out front.
- Is there another way out of here?
- No.
- Did he sign a commutation?
- Yes, he signed it.
Here it is.
And here's something else you can have.
There will be a state official here tomorrow
to take the Kid over to the prison at Lincoln.
Well, this is what we wanted.
The lawman's gone.
The rest of them are still out there.
- Are they coming in?
- I don't know.
- Ben, is that you?
- Yeah, it's me, Ruth.
Thank goodness you're back.
Campbell isn't going to hang.
- I'm so happy for your sake.
- I am, too.
I don't think it's right, but it's a relief.
Well, it looks all right.
- What is it?
- It's a girl headed right this way.
Wait till she knocks, then let her in.
Let me in! It's Laurie Cutler!
- Eddie, what are you...
- Shut up. See how it is.
It's all clear. Let's go.
Eddie, they're not gonna hang you.
The Governor stopped it.
You don't say. Keep your mouth shut,
and you won't get hurt.
Eddie, please! You can't. Not after what...
Eddie, no!
Let's get out of here, Kid!
Come on.
What happened here?
- The Kid.
- Are you all right?
It's just a bump on the head.
Go get them, Ben.
Ruth, are you crazy? Get out of here!
Randolph, get her out.
Dad, look out!
On the scaffold.
Thanks, Paul. How bad you hit?
- I'll be all right.
- Come on, let's get you out of here.
Take it easy.
I told you it was hard
being the only doctor in town.
He's gonna be all right, Laurie.
Take him over to Doc Simmons in Sycamore.
Put it back on. Please.
Who's gonna look after
us fools if you don't, Ben?
