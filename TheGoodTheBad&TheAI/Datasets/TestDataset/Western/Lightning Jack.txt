Junction City!
Stay.
Excuse me.
Marshall, it's the Younger gang!
I just saw them, bold as brass!
- Take it steady, Frank.
- Cole and Bob Younger. No mistake.
- Where are they?
- The bank. Four men, right now.
The Younger brothers.
Looks like we caught us
a real big fish.
All right, boys.
Spread the word.
Everyone knows what to do.
Just tell them to hold it
till I give the signal.
All right, gentlemen.
Hold steady.
Now we can do this the easy way--
nobody has to die--
or we could do it the hard way.
The choice is yours.
You, open the safe.
I don't know the combination.
I hit him.
I shot Lightning Jack Kane.
I got him, Clem.
I seen him buck just as I fired.
I just shot Kane,
the fastest gun alive.
Maybe you hit him too,
but mine was a head shot.
Knocked him forward,
right out of the saddle.
There ain't no maybes.
My shot was plumb in the middle.
It's the Younger brothers.
We got the Younger brothers!
- We got one too!
- I got one.
Set the camera up here.
Let's get that dead body
in the front.
I want the committee
right behind it.
And get the town hall in the back.
This is history.
That there is Sam Jorgenson.
Where's the other one?
Where's that Lightning Jack?
We got Kane, Marshall. Me and Pat here,
we filled him full of holes.
Horse took a fright
and dragged the body, I reckon.
He ain't the fastest gun alive--
not anymore.
- You better go fetch the body.
- Yes, sir.
Marshall Kurtz in the center. You've
gotta be in the center of the photo.
Can we have a statement?
I'm not much for speeches.
I leave that to the politicians.
I am just a man
who's doing the job...
that people elected me to do.
I think today we sent out a message
to all lawbreakers.
In Junction City...
you will respect the law...
or you will learn to fear it!
- Hear! Hear!
- Right!
I guess these boys
are just slow learners.
Three cheers for Marshall Kurtz.
Hip, hip, hooray!
All right. Hold it.
- Read that out to me.
- Yes, sir.
But you don't need the gun, sir.
I ain't the law.
Read it.
''Younger gang wiped out.''
That part.
''The only flaw in the trap
was the escape...
of Lightning Jack Kane...
although several witnesses swore...
he was shot full of holes...
and riding dead in the saddle.
Kane is of medium height
and build, blond hair...
with a mean, weathered face...
and has an English accent.''
- English?
- Yes, sir.
I don't speak English.
I'm a bloody Australian!
How can I send this
to my mates back home...
and tell them what a big success I am
if it says I'm English?
- Bloody newspapers. Never get it right.
- That's right.
''Marshall Dan Kurtz
was unconcerned...
saying, 'Dead or alive...
Kane don't matter.
We got Cole Younger.
He was the leader and brains
of the gang.
Kane was a follower...
and just a brainless no-account.
Without the Younger brothers,
he's nothing.'''
He's nothin'?
Without the Younger brothers,
I'm nothin'?
Right.
Brainless no-account?
That's what it said.
We'll see who's brainless.
What's all that shooting
down there?
What's going on?
You got that, boy?
That's four bags of salt...
two bags of flour.
That's on top...
of my regular order.
His handwriting is so messed up,
Mr. Curran. Maybe I can make it out.
It says, ''Thank you, sir.
Is that everything?''
That's what I thought it said,
but it's bad written, real bad.
Get him to load the rest
on the wagon out there...
and you better do
the tallying up yourself.
Being he can't write proper...
we don't want him
doing no figuring, do we?
Put the rest of those goods
on Mr. Curran's wagon.
And no more sass, you hear?
Pay him no heed, Mr. Doyle. It's a fine
Christian thing you've done...
taking on this poor, unfortunate boy.
It's been a real struggle,
Mrs. Franks.
The boy was poorly raised.
His folks filled his head
with all kind of fool thoughts...
that he was just as good
as a normal man.
Of course when they died
of the cholera...
I knew it was my Christian duty
to take him in--
try to get his mind right.
Bless you.
Good day, Mr. Doyle.
Good day to you.
It's real hot out there today.
Oh, it sure is.
Ben.
Judge Curran
is one of my best customers.
I ain't gonna have you sassin' him.
That's it! No more notes
and no more writing.
You understand?
Half the folks around here
can't read or write.
And it irks them
that somebody like you can.
It's unnatural.
I took you on when nobody else would.
I deserve some gratitude.
Finish loading
and tally up the cash drawer...
and take it to the bank.
Now hold steady, gentlemen.
We can do this the easy way--
no one has to die--
or we can do it the hard way,
but the choice is yours.
Fill it up.
Shut the door. Against the wall.
Hands in the air.
Keep clear of that window.
Fill it up.
Yeah.
Against the wall.
Keep away from the window.
What the hell's this?
- Storekeepers. We're closing up.
- What?
Stores-- they close at 4:00.
They do their bankin' from 4:00 to 5:00.
Maybe you ought to come back
after 5:00.
You.
You.
Yeah. Open the safe.
I said open the safe.
I can't. I'm just a teller.
Only the manager knows the combination.
Where's the manager?
Shit.
Over there.
Away from the window.
Hey, they're robbing the bank!
Quick, call the sheriff!
Hands down! Give me that.
Better hope you got
a lot of friends out there.
- Hold still, boys. He's got a hostage.
- It's only the dummy.
Hold still, everyone.
Mate, come on.
Trail 'em,Jed,
but stay well back.
We need a few good riflemen
with fresh horses.
Find me someone that can read tracks.
We'll meet at the livery stable.
Go.
One word and you're dead.
- Where did they go,Jed?
- Through that pass.
Do we circle?
No, follow me!
Mount up.
When I say jump, you jump.
No questions, no back talk.
Mount up.
What are you,
part Indian or something?
No, an Indian
would have been smart enough...
to let me ride right into them.
- Tracks gotta be here somewhere.
- Take the men and circle the ridge.
- We'll head for the county line.
- Let's go, boys.
Get down.
You did good.
Kept your mouth shut.
I'm letting you go.
You can talk now.
You can't talk?
Turn around.
Face that tree.
Turn back, you're a dead man.
Don't even think about it.
''I'll join your gang.''
What gang?
What are you gonna do anyway,
walk into a bank and write 'em a note?
Dumbest thing I ever heard of.
Take your boots off.
Quick. I don't want you
running back over there...
to tell the posse where we are.
Just be glad...
that you're walking back to town...
instead of lying
across the saddle.
Hold up, boys.
It don't make no sense.
He's turned the horse loose
and kept the boy.
Maybe he's just running that poor
dummy boy barefoot out of pure meanness.
Stay alert, men.
And shoot on sight.
Shit, how did you get--
I'm snakebit.
I can't be snakebit.
That's a Navajo snake charm.
Cost me $50.
Yeah.
Suck the poison.
You're gonna have to suck
the poison out.
I can't reach it.
What? Put the gun down?
That's it?
Is it just a splinter?
No bite.
See? Snake charm works.
I ain't scared of snakes, okay?
I just don't like 'em.
Nonetheless...
you was willing to chaw on my butt
to save my hide.
Fact is...
you've been saving my hide
since we met.
I ain't a man
to take that lightly.
Let's git.
They'd have turned back by now.
A posse will never cross
the county line.
We've got some talking to do.
I thought you'd given up tobacco.
All right.Just this once.
How come you can't talk?
Baby. You had a baby.
You're the baby.
Baby can't talk.
You was born dumb...
but not deaf.
Not deaf.
What's your name?
What do people call you?
Ben Doyle. Ben Doyle...
meet Lightning Jack Kane.
That's the Lightning Jack Kane.
You probably heard of me.
Outlaw.
You want to be an outlaw?
Doesn't everybody?
Gonna help me rob a bank.
Yeah, I could have used
some backup last time, but--
Your ears, your eyes for me.
You think I need them?
What makes you think
I need your eyes?
Just what gave you that notion?
Yeah, well, my eyes get
a little fuzzy up close...
trying to read
and squinting down a sight...
but I can hit anything
you can point at...
and it'll be dead
before your finger's straight.
See that? That's an evil eye.
Got it off a Navajo medicine man.
$ 7 5.
That's my aiming eye.
So don't starting thinking
just 'cause one part of me...
ain't working good
that I got a weakness.
Yeah.
I guess you know better than me
how folks react to weakness.
Anyway, you still think
I need help?
''I can tell a one-dollar bill
from a hundred-dollar bill.
They're all ones!
I knocked off a bank
for 50 bucks.
What?
''I'll never tell anyone.''
Oh, you'll never tell anyone.
Of course.
Hey, while you're at it...
don't go talking to no one
about that snakebite either, eh?
Don't go talkin' to no one, eh?
I just come out with 'em.
Don't go talking to no one.
Don't tell anyone.
I'll probably make up a lot more
funny jokes like that about you.
But if you ride with me,
nobody else will.
Have you ever tried
Arizona chicken?
Australia is a colony.
So if you rob a bank back there,
you're wanted all over the country.
But in America, you can rob banks
in five different states.
You still got another 30.
Across the border and you run free.
No worries. Yeah,
democracy is a wonderful thing.
What?
Ah, gut pain.
Well, pick your outhouse.
And next time you eat buzzard,
only the drumsticks.
We ain't got all day.
Go anywhere.
Must have been a powerful,
bad smeller.
What do you smell, old Mate?
Not you. Him. He's Mate.
That's his name.
I was going to call him Thunder
at one stage.
You know,
Lightning Jack and Thunder.
He wouldn't hear of it.
Aha. That's what he smelt.
No, they're just plain folks.
I never shoot plain folks...
unless they annoy me.
Mount up.
Sling it.
Act like your mind's gone away.
Smile. I don't need a gun.
I'm gonna charm these folks
out of a $ 10 horse.
Five dollars, maybe less.
I got a silver tongue.
Howdy, neighbors.
$30 for this bag of bones!
Thieving bastard.
I should have shot him.
Now relax.
Like I said, democracy.
We're not wanted in this state
till after we rob the bank.
All right. I go in...
I go to the far wall...
wave the money,
then you come in.
I do the speech.
All you gotta do is draw your gun...
and cover me.
Oh, unless someone goes
for their gun.
Then you shoot them.
Now, hold steady, gentlemen. Ma'am.
We can do this the easy way--
no one has to die--
or we can do it the hard way.
The choice is yours.
There's someone robbing the bank!
Get the sheriff, quick!
Bank robbery bungled.
''In a display of criminal stupidity...
one of the two would-be robbers
managed to shoot himself...
before the tellers
could even raise their hands.
His partner panicked...
and the two fled in fear as
the bank staff laughed in their faces.
One witness thought one of the men
was Jack Kane.''Jack Kane?
What happened to Lightning Jack?
I sweat blood earning that handle...
and some pissant reporter
just leaves it out.
I'm writing him a letter.
''But U.S. Marshal Daniel Kurtz
dismissed this claim...
saying, 'Every time there's a robbery,
someone identifies Kane.
But that colorful outlaw era
is finished.
Kane is just a loose end
who will be cut off.
He sure ain't no Jesse James.'''
What do they mean,
I ain't no Jesse James?
What's so special about Jesse James?
He sure didn't impress me none.
Do I know Jesse James? Yeah.
Rode on a few banks a couple of years
back with him and his brother Frank.
Frank's the brains.
Jesse is a pecker-head.
Pecker. Down there.
That's your pecker.
Jesse's a pecker-head.
Is he bald?
No, he's not bald.
Just dumb.
Dumb like I was to try and rob a bank
with a greenhorn like you.
We've got to face the facts.
I was born to be an outlaw.
You wasn't.
Go home, kid. Forget it.
Just one good headline.
Is that too much to ask?
You want bullets?
What do you want them for?
Gonna rob a bank?
By yourself?
Oh, you're gonna join up
with the James boys.
They're gonna learn you
to be an outlaw?
So one day I'll pick up the newspaper,
and it'll say...
''Jesse James and Ben Doyle rob bank.''
Like they could teach you things
that I couldn't.
I suppose they'll put that
in the paper too.
''Jesse James succeeds
where Jack Kane failed.''
Nah.
I was just joshing you.
Come on.
Those James boys couldn't even teach you
to fart like an outlaw.
Yeah. There'll be more of them.
If they come down for a visit,
just do like I do.
I've spent some friendly time
with the Navajo.
There'll be no trouble
if we follow their rules.
Just passing through.
Show no fear. No disrespect.
But most important--
Shit.
No rules. They're Comanche.
Just mount up steady-like.
They ain't gone.
Comanche don't even have a word
for retreat.
They'll be circling right now.
That means the other three
will come from my side.
Don't shoot, no matter what.
Just follow me.
Get down! Ride low!
Try and stay on your horse.
I can't take on the whole bloody tribe.
Why didn't we shoot them?
They're Comanche.
We don't know their names.
You don't know nothing
about Indians, do you?
If you kill a Comanche
and you don't know his name...
his spirit goes into an owl...
and every night that owl will
come around calling out, ''Who? Who?''
If you can't sing out the right name,
it'll follow you forever.
Bad medicine.
Eh? I learnt that secret
from old Red Eagle himself.
He was a Comanche.
Sold me this charm.
It keeps grizzly bears away.
Only $30.
I think we got a problem, Dan.
Granville? That's ten days' hard ride
from where he was hiding two days ago.
- This is horse shit.
- No, it's called competition.
That stuff we ran on law and order
and the Younger gang wipeout...
got picked up nationwide.
Heck, the Mail made you
a national hero, Dan.
So our rivals are rooting
for the underdog.
They'll try and turn Kane
into some kind of folk hero outlaw.
Then you'll be just the lawman
who failed to catch him.
So far it's just this one small paper,
but it could catch on.
Then we'll have to deflate
Mr. Kane pronto.
How?
I can find the right people
with the proper incentive.
What I need is some financial support
from the law and order association.
Well, I'm sure
that can be arranged.
Junction City and the Mail
are behind you 100%.
Governor.
I'm safe.
There's no law in Wayside Flats.
I got us a cabin
a couple of miles up the road.
Tomorrow I'll start teaching you
the outlaw trade.
But now there's something
more important--
the Red Garter Saloon.
There's only one reason
this town exists.
Tell me, how long has it been
since you bedded down a woman?
Don't know?
You never?
You never?
You're a full-grown man.
We're outlaws.
Figured on learning you
how to rob banks.
Never figured on learning you
at lovemaking.
