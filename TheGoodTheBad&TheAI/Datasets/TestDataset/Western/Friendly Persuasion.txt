Samantha!
Thee old hisser!
I'll blow thee up with a cannon!
Some day I'll drown thee,
thee old squawker!
Little Jess!
What is thee saying, child?
Samantha tried to bite my legs off.
Next time, I'll throw her down the well.
Here, Samantha.
See, Little Jess?
Speak to her kindly.
She'll not bite thee.
She's a pure pet, Samantha is.
She's a snake on stilts!
I'll put her on the chopping block
and chop her head off.
Hush, hush!
Let's have no more talk of killing.
Run upstairs now and fetch thy brother
and sister. We'll be late for Meeting.
Blackberry pie?
Yes, blackberry pie.
No need to stick thy finger in it
to find out. No dilly-dallying!
Go fetch Mattie and Josh.
Well...
...perhaps.
Well!
This afternoon?
All right!
What's thee talking to thyself for?
I'm not talking to myself.
Who's thee talking to then?
I don't see nobody.
Thee knows what happens
to eavesdroppers?
Their ears get long as a hound dog's!
Mama says to hurry.
I am, but I have to finish
my toilet-tee.
What's a toilet-tee?
Thee wouldn't know about it
because thee doesn't wash.
Please leave my boudoir.
"Please leave my boudoir."
Does thee...
Does thee think I'm pretty?
Thee's not ugly.
I guess thee's pretty...
...for a girl.
Well, thank thee!
Thee's welcome.
Powie! I got Jeff Davis!
Powie! I got old Stonewall Jackson!
Powie! I got old Little Jess Birdwell!
Meet the real Stonewall Jackson...
...and thee won't feel so feisty.
Get up.
What would thee do
if thee met Old Stonewall?
Mama said not to talk about the war.
Mama said for thee to hurry up.
She's the preacher.
Meeting can't start till she's there.
And anyway, Caleb Cope and me
are riding our horses to Meeting.
Thee old long arms!
Look! Pa's warming up Red Rover.
Where?
How a horse can look so fast
and move so slow beats me.
Thee can hitch him up, Enoch.
You got him nice and warm this morning.
Whoa, Mildred!
Hello there.
Guess I'm lost.
Must have got on the wrong road.
My! Quite a looker, that horse.
He's a looker, all right.
Maybe you can help me. I'm trying
to find that Methodist church.
Thy first turn's at the crossroads.
Bear right for three miles.
Is thee preaching there this morning?
- Who's preaching there?
- Thee?
- Who?
- Thee.
Me?
That's a dandy!
Son, I'm not a man of the cloth.
I sell organs.
Now, what in thunderation is all this
thee-ing and thou-ing about?
Bible talk to honor the Sabbath?
No, we talk that way weekdays too.
Excuse me, but it sounds mighty queer.
Who's "we"?
Quakers.
Quakers! Have you folks
got a church around here?
Yes, we call it a Meeting House.
It's just beyond the Methodist Church.
Hast thou an organ in thine
Meeting House, friend?
We don't hold with music playing.
What, no organ?
Dear me! Why, a church
without an organ...
...is like a tree without a bird.
Wait till I talk
to that minister of yours.
He'll never be content
until he buys an organ.
I wish thee luck with the preacher.
That's three miles over, take
the main road, turn right. I got it.
Thank you.
Thee.
Get up!
Now look, Mildred...
...there is a horse!
- I'm going by Caleb's, Pa.
- All right, son.
Red Rover, that man
paid thee a compliment.
If he only knew.
Listen, Red, just don't slow down...
...when thee hears Sam Jordan
coming behind us...
...and, by sugar, we'll stay
out in front today.
- Thee say something, Jess?
- I was just soothing Red Rover.
If thee talked as much to the Almighty
as thee does to that horse...
...thee might stand more squarely
in the light.
Sounds like thy sermon's
already begun, Eliza.
Why, Jess!
I thought thee liked my preaching.
Now, Eliza, thee has the prettiest
pulpit voice I ever heard.
And thee says the truest words.
Especially during Silent Meeting?
And this morning,
thee looks like a girl.
Where's Little Jess? Mattie!
I'm coming, Mama.
Made the stockade in the nick of time.
- Goodbye, folks.
- Goodbye, Enoch.
Good luck, Mr. Birdwell.
Why does Enoch wish thee good luck
every First Day morning?
I guess it's because he...
He wishes me luck!
Hey, Papa, look!
It's thy friend, Sam Jordon, Jess.
No need to look. I can feel him.
Gard's with him!
Mattie, Little Jess, stop craning
thy necks at the Jordans.
It isn't seemly.
Yes, Mama.
Sure are a-coming.
Thee's not urging thy horse?
Not urging. Just encouraging a mite.
Come on, Red Rover!
Sit down!
Come on, Prince!
Come on, lazybones!
Come on, Prince! Good boy!
What's gotten into thee?
Morning, Mattie.
Morning, Eliza.
Good morning, Jess.
- Come on, Papa!
- Come on, Prince!
Come back, come back!
Mama!
Little Jess, let go!
Come on, Prince!
Gard winked at Mattie.
He did not!
I saw him.
Gard wouldn't do such a vulgar thing!
I hope nobody saw us.
Me too.
I want to come to Meeting with nothing
in my heart but peace and love.
Thee gives me a pain.
Last week...
...I had my 80th birthday.
And I'd like to bear witness
to
First chapter...
...33rd verse.
"Who so harkeneth unto Me...
...shall dwell safely...
...and shall be quiet
from fear of evil."
Amen, Emma. Amen.
I ask the prayers of everyone here
to help me be less worldly...
...less concerned about my appearance...
...to mind my tongue...
...and especially have the strength
not to wear earrings.
I've never spoken in Meeting before...
...but I feel so happy this morning
I'd like to share my happiness...
...with everyone in the whole world.
And to thank our Heavenly Father.
God is love!
- Is this it?
- Yes, sir.
Won't thee come in, friend?
Thank you.
You're the minister of this meeting?
I am. One of them.
My name is Major Harvey.
- Won't thee sit down, friend?
- Thank you, no.
I've had the duty placed upon me of
speaking to you Quakers about the war.
It is a matter much on our minds...
...and in our prayers.
But your men don't fight in it.
Some have.
But you do not encourage them.
We do not encourage them.
Ma'am, the Union has endured
two years of bloody civil war.
Thousands have given their lives in
battle to free our country from slavery.
We are opposed to slavery.
But we do not believe it right
to kill one man to free another.
Ma'am, it's not going to be a question
of fighting for freedom or a principle...
...but of protecting our own towns,
our own homes, from attack.
Would you men stand by while others
die to protect you?
You look like a boy who could give a
good account of himself.
I've been tempted to fight.
I guess the Good Lord knows why.
I mean, sometimes I get the
sinful wish to get into a scrap.
So I got to watch myself
closer than most people.
So I'll just stay away from the war.
Because if I ever got into it,
I'd be a goner.
And you, son?
Are you ready to put up with looting
and killing without lifting a finger?
Are you afraid to fight?
I don't know.
Here, at last, is an honest answer.
I don't wish to offend...
...but how many of you are hiding
behind your church to save your skins?
Is it right to let others fight for you?
To protect your lives and your property?
Why don't you speak up?
I'll speak up.
Nothing could ever induce me
to bear arms against my fellow man.
Burn my house!
Destroy my crops! Attack my family!
And I declare to all...
...especially to thee, Josh Birdwell,
wavering in thy convictions...
...nothing can move me to violence!
Nothing!
It seems Friend Purdy has already
been moved to considerable violence.
I misdoubt any of us here
could say with surety...
...what we would do in case of attack.
I have my doubts as to the strength
of thy convictions too.
I have my own doubts.
I've often asked myself...
...what I would do if I saw
my family endangered...
...my wife and children threatened.
If the test comes, all I can say is...
...I hope and pray I can be an
instrument of the Lord.
That test is coming.
It may well be so, friend.
Let us pray that the will of God
be revealed to us...
...and we be given the strength
and grace to follow His will.
Lord...
...let Thy children partake of Thy love
and the love of all men...
...rendering not evil for evil,
nor violence for violence done.
Let swords be changed into
ploughshares...
...and spears into pruning hooks...
...and children of peace
learn war no more...
...forever.
Eliza, what does thee like about
that shifty-eyed bird?
Why, Jess!
She marches along so lordly-like.
Marched real lordly through two pecks
of young strawberries this morning.
- Hello, Gard.
- Hello, Josh.
- You home on leave?
- Got a week's furlough.
Hello, Little Jess, Mrs. Birdwell.
Hello, Mr. Birdwell.
I came over to apologize about
that little brush last Sunday.
It wasn't my idea.
We know that.
Jess is going to get a nice slow horse
that doesn't have any racing ideas.
Did thee shoot any rebs?
What are they like?
They're just people like us.
But did thee shoot any?
Let's have no more talk of war...
...and killing.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
- Come in and set.
- Thank you.
You folks going to the fair?
I used to like the fair...
...but it's come to be
no place for us.
They've got some fine exhibits.
Needlework, livestock, poultry.
And geese.
Eliza, it might be just the place
to pick us up a nice slow horse.
Thee go, Jess. The fair's come to have
so many sideshows, freaks, dancing...
Dancing?
What does thee know about dancing?
She knows a thing or two.
Did Mama ever dance?
That was 20 years ago.
Twenty years exactly, come October.
I was courting her.
But did Mama dance?
No, child.
She was tempted to lift a foot,
but she married me instead.
Did thee propose then and there?
Dinner's ready.
Stay and eat with us?
Thank you, ma'am.
I'd be pleased to.
What about the fair?
- Come on, Josh, Jess.
- Can we go, Papa?
There's no point in putting temptation
in the children's paths.
We'd resist it.
We'd resist it as well as thee did.
Why can't we go?
She'll never let us go.
Mama's so straight-laced!
Maybe I can loosen up a few laces.
Isn't it ghastly, ladies and gentlemen?
Isn't it horrible?
This shining blade,
with the razor-edged blade...
...will pass through his mouth,
through his throat...
...into his very vitals!
And here we have Flame-o...
...the Human Volcano!
Do not deprive your children
of this educational act.
Let's get away from here.
- I promised Caleb I'd meet him.
- Mattie, look at the quilting with me.
Thee wants to see quilts, Josh wants to
meet Caleb, and I want to see livestock.
Let's meet...
...over here by the harvesting machine
in one hour.
Thee stay with me.
Oh, Josh.
There's a rock exhibit I think
thee and Caleb might find edifying.
- Rocks?
- Come along.
I'm hungry. I want some candy.
Thee's had thy breakfast. Come along.
I'm thirsty.
You shoot that squirrel down
three times, you get a beautiful prize.
It's a hit!
How's that?
Got him.
Howdy, Mr. Birdwell.
Say, you're an old squirrel-shooter.
I'll treat you.
Give that man a rifle.
Another marksman here.
That squirrel sits so still
he makes me nervous.
Never mind the comments, just hit...
He did hit the squirrel!
Where's Mattie?
They're over by the quilting booth.
See you later.
Thanks, Gard.
Folks, the man's about to shoot...
He hit it again!
Thee wait right here.
You won yourself one of these
beautiful prizes here.
One of these beautiful pri...
One of these beautiful prizes.
Them prizes was made and manufactured...
...by Pierre of Paris, France.
You heard of him?
I ain't either. The man's having a
hard time to make up his mind here.
For Eliza?
- No, thanks.
- Wait!
You won it fair and square.
I insist you take them, friend.
There! Pair of garters
for your wife to wear!
Or your sweetheart!
Just as soon as you get out of mourning.
Come on.
I want to show you something.
How about a demonstration?
I'd just be delighted.
Delighted. Step right in, gentlemen.
Nothing would please me more.
Low bridge.
Well, Mr. Birdwell, come right in.
Gentlemen, welcome to my organatorium.
Just make yourself at home.
A temple of temptations,
full of instruments of the devil.
Gentlemen, I'd like you to take
a look at this magnificent instrument.
Now, isn't that a beauty?
Just as smooth as silk,
and as fine as frog's hair.
I'll pay two to one if you guess
the shell which contains the pea.
Take your chin off the board.
You'll tip it.
As you see, there's nothing here,
nothing here.
The pea's there,
and I put the shell over it.
Now, we move the shells.
Watch very closely.
Now where is the elusive little pea?
Boy...
...will you go away?
Forty-eight reeds,
plus the tuba miraballis.
How many stops?
So you know organs!
It has eight stops
and this vox humana.
Cries like a baby, sighs like a woman.
I'm partial to music, but I'm a Quaker
and they're against music.
The Quaker!
Why, certainly I remember distinctly.
Thee, thy, thou...
Of course.
But I want you to know, sir,
I honor your prejudices...
...convictions.
Boys, let me tell you...
...there are two kinds of music just the
same as there are two kinds of women:
The uplifting kind and the...
Now, here.
You take the banjo. Now, there.
There is an instrument that stirs up
a man's worst passions.
Speech!
Speech, ma'am!
Thank thee kindly.
Watch very closely. We go again.
Oh, fellows!
By George! That was wonderful!
This is that rare silver process.
You see the fine workmanship of
Professor Grady. He is the foremost...
Now where is the little pea?
Thank you, madam. Thank you!
Everything's back to normal now.
Now, just a minute.
Place your fingers there. That's it.
Now pump.
Wonderful!
Why, Friend Birdwell,
you've got a real touch.
A real, natural-born touch.
Ice-cold lemonade here!
Who'll have a cold drink?
Has thee forgotten thyself?
I'm to blame.
Mattie didn't want to dance.
I made her.
Let's look for thy father.
It's my last day of furlough.
I mean, I was hoping that Mattie
could stay with me for a while.
Gardiner, thy duties as a soldier
and Mattie's as a Quaker lie far apart.
God bless thee, Gard.
Come along.
Goodbye.
That's a mighty fine fight.
A mighty fine fight!
Here's your coat.
All right, men. Now's your chance
to get the Billy Goat.
Who'd like to give me a silver dollar?
Is there one man...
Caleb Cope!
He can throw the Billy Goat!
- Which one is that?
- There.
You mean the Quaker man here?
Come on in here, Quaker man!
Thee shouldn't fight.
This ain't fighting.
This is just friendly wrestling.
Go get him, Quaker!
All right, gentlemen!
May the best man win.
Let's go!
- Did I hurt you?
- What's wrong with you?
You didn't hurt me. Let's go.
No, thanks.
Come on. Let's go.
What's the matter with you?
The Quaker boy quit!
- Why didn't you kiss him?
- Quitter!
Quitter!
Hold on. I want to talk to you.
Leave him alone.
It's against his principle to fight.
Losing a bet's against my principles.
I think you're in with the boss.
- No, sir.
- So why'd you stop?
- He's a Quaker.
- Shut up! Who wants to hear you?
- Let them alone! These boys believe...
- I know.
They believe in loving their neighbor.
I'm their neighbor.
Do you still love me?
I feel sorry for thee, friend.
Thee feels sorry for me?
Don't let him talk to you that way.
Milk sop!
If thee wants to hit
someone, friend, hit me.
It'll be a pleasure.
I'll take a whack at him.
You want to fight?
You aren't showing me nothing.
What's the matter, Quaker boy?
- What's the trouble, friend?
- Another friend!
Thee needs cooling off.
My hat!
- Let me up!
- Thee not thirsty, friend?
Is thee having an altercation?
Okay, let's break it up.
Come on.
Fighting!
Dancing! Gambling!
Wrestling! And...
- Sleeve-holders.
- Sleeve-holders?
I never saw sleeve-holders like that.
They're from...
...Pierre, in Paris.
Listen, thee dirty...
But Mama, he took my hat.
It'll be a pretty day. Be hot
the other side of the Ohio though.
I wish thee didn't have to
make this trip.
It's too close to the war to be safe.
Now, Eliza, I have to
see my customers...
...this time of the year.
Leave Josh at home then.
He's so young to be exposed to danger.
Thee can't keep him tied
to thy apron strings.
This trip will be good for him.
Horse is hitched, bags stowed away,
we're off! Let's go!
Is thee so anxious to leave home?
I want to see Ohio.
I'll miss thee.
Come on, Pa!
Take good care of Josh.
God bless and keep thee.
Jess, see if thee can't
get rid of that horse.
- Afternoon.
- Howdy!
Man of the house around?
Ain't no man in this house
since Pa died.
And Mrs. Hudsp...
Hudspeth?
Ma's here.
Couple of men to see you!
Men!
Men?
Ma's coming!
Hi!
Hello.
- Mrs. Hudspeth?
- That's me.
I'm Jess Birdwell. I have
first-class nursery stock for sale.
- What kind?
- Everything in orchard fruits.
If thee likes apple trees, there's
Maiden's Blush, Ramblos and Winesaps.
In the berry line, there's
raspberries, gooseberries and the like.
- This your boy?
- This is Joshua.
Meet my girls.
This is Opal, Ruby,
she's my baby, and Pearl.
Gems, every one of them!
Girls, meet Joshua.
Back!
Don't overdo it, girls.
Come in the house.
Let's talk business in comfort.
Sit down, son.
They won't bite you.
Menfolks are so scarce here, the girls
get carried away at the sight of one.
But I keep telling them, "Easy does it."
Ain't that right?
As a Quaker, I've always been
against violence, Mrs. Hudspeth.
A Quaker, huh?
I guessed as much
from the way you talk.
All that thee-ing and thy-ing.
If I put my mind to it, I can say
you or yours if it suits thee.
No, sir.
"Pleased to meet thee.
Are these thy daughters?"
Prettiest talk I ever heard.
Makes me feel kind of romantic.
Come sit down.
Let's talk business back here.
You been on the road long?
About ten days.
Heading home tomorrow.
See any rebel raiders?
Everything peaceful all the way.
I hope you're right.
What if them ruffians come thieving
with nobody on the farm...
...but four defenseless women?
I shudder to think of it.
Now, about that nursery stock...
First look at my south 40...
...and tell me what orchard stock
would be best there. Opal!
Go hitch up Lady.
We'll drive my mare.
Give your animal a rest.
We can bed you down for the night.
That's very kind.
- But...
- Oh, now, no buts!
Glad to have some men around
for a change.
Ruby.
Go lay out some clean bedding,
will you?
All right, Ma.
Get going.
Pearl, take care of Josh
while we're gone.
Now, you just set right back here.
I don't want to be a bother.
You ain't no bother.
Sure is a nice place thee has here.
Want a smoke?
I don't smoke.
Want a drink?
I don't drink either.
Thee have one.
Not unless you do.
Is this a Narragansett Pacer?
You know that breed?
Thee's a favored woman.
That mare ain't got
but one real fault.
She won't be passed.
- Won't be passed?
- No, sir!
What's the fault in that?
I've got three marriageable daughters.
A man ain't got any heart for courting
a girl he can't catch up with...
...let alone pass.
It shouldn't be hard to find
a horse willing to be passed.
Hello, Abigail!
That's old Whiskey Pete.
He ain't drawed a sober breath
in 30 years.
Fool's always trying to race somebody.
Old drunk!
Why don't thee let her out?
Don't fight her. Let her go!
I'm going to learn this consarned mare
she's got to be passed!
Put my hat on!
Pull it down!
Not that far!
What are you doing?
It's all right.
Easy, Lady. Easy.
Sorry, I kind of overreached myself,
grabbing the reins thataway.
Don't apologize.
For a man, it's suitable to beat
another man in a race on a public road.
Do you ever think about getting
thy girls a horse a mite more...
...maidenly-acting?
I've thought of it.
You've got a stylish animal.
Red Rover's a looker, all right.
Got racing notions?
Not that he can't pick up
his heels a bit.
But racing's a thing
he's got no stomach for.
You wouldn't consider a trade, I reckon.
I don't know.
A strong-minded animal like this
can be a plaguey nuisance.
A forceful man like yourself
could learn her better in no time.
If you's a mind to.
Seems a likely exchange.
Then let's shake on it.
Don't leave it hanging.
They're coming!
They're coming!
I'm glad to have thee home.
- Thee'll break my ribs!
- I'll get the bags.
I'm glad thee's back.
I've missed thee.
I've missed thee.
Come, thee must be hungry.
- Where's Mattie?
- She'll be back soon.
Where'd thee get this horse?
Thee kept thy word.
Thee got rid of Red Rover.
Glad to see you.
Is this horse well?
There's nothing to fear on that score.
She's not much to look at.
But if thee doesn't mind that...
Mind!
This is the very horse
I've been praying for.
A good, plain animal that won't fill
every man on the pike with racing ideas.
Lady'll discourage racing ideas,
I promise thee.
Come in.
Thee must be starved.
We haven't had a good meal
since we left.
I'll be in in a minute.
I'll help thee unhitch, Enoch.
This looks like the place.
Hello, there!
Good evening.
Certainly is good to see you again.
Here we are.
Good evening.
You know, it is certainly
a pleasure to see you.
This is a joy I've been waiting for.
I offer you...
...my salutations, my felicitations
and my congratulations.
What for?
Why, ma'am, this organ.
The world's finest!
You've got a treat coming to you.
Just hold your breath.
Now look at that.
Isn't that a beauty?
Genuine walnut. Not an inch of
unornamented wood in the entire cabinet.
Good evening, Brother Birdwell!
Hello, there.
There must be some mistake.
This gentleman says thee's mixed up...
...with this musical instrument.
"Mixed" is scarcely the word for it.
It's gone beyond courting to marriage.
Your husband...
Thy husband is now the proud
and lucky owner of a Payson and Clarke.
This organ. This substitute on earth
for choiring angels.
Father Birdwell, why keep
the lady in suspense?
You just give me a hand
and we'll get it inside.
We must step delicately.
My wife is a Quaker minister.
You may know all about
Quaker ministers, but I know women.
What a woman wants is a good,
firm hand and a strong voice.
Not Eliza.
Wait until you hear your husband...
...when he seats himself
at this console.
You know, you are married to an artist.
I forbid thee to have this instrument!
"Forbid"?
For thy own sake, I forbid.
When thee asks...
...or suggests...
...l'm like putty in thy hands.
But when thee forbids,
thee is barking up the wrong tree.
- Come on, Quigley.
- I don't know what's come over thee.
Bringing a thing like this here.
And me a recorded minister!
Thee order that instrument back
to where it came from.
I bought it and I'm going to keep it.
I don't know what's come over thee.
I'm warning thee...
...if thee takes that instrument
into the house, I go out.
