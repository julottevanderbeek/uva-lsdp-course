Man: TUFT OFF A RECENTLY
DECAPITATED INDIAN...
AUTHENTIC HEATHEN
HAIR TUFTS.
HEAD BROUGHT TO CAMP
SAME DAY
AS WILD BILL HICKOK
WAS KILLED.
OR FIVE TUFTS
FOR $1.
DON'T MISS YOUR CHANCE
AT A FINE SOUVENIR, BOYS,
AUTHENTIC HEATHEN
HAIR TUFTS.
SEND THEM EAST
TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY.
AND IF YOU WAS TO SAY
IN YOUR LETTER
WITH THE TUFTS
INSIDE IT,
IT WAS YOU WHO CUT
THE COCKSUCKER'S HEAD OFF,
WHO'D BE THERE
TO GAINSAY IT?
ONLY THOSE ADMITTED
TO THE BAR
MAY JOIN THE LINE
OF CANDIDATES
FOR OFFICERS
OF THE COURT.
JURORS WILL BE DRAWN
FROM THE HAT ON MY RIGHT.
OFFICERS OF THE COURT,
IN THE BOX ON MY LEFT.
I HAVE NO SAY
IN EITHER OUTCOME,
SO PLEASE DON'T
TRY TO BRIBE ME.
- THAT NEWSPAPER FELLA SEEMS A GOOD SORT.
- HE'S ALL RIGHT.
HOW FAR INTO THE PROCESS
YOU THINK HE'LL STAY INVOLVED?
TILL THEM SHYSTERS
TAKE OVER.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
BECOME OF THE WOMAN
WHO WAS MR. HICKOK'S
FRIEND.
PROBABLY DRUNK
OVER HIS MURDER.
WELL, THERE'S A CHILD
TO BE CONSIDERED.
AND SHE COULDN'T
BE DOING BETTER.
DESPITE HER SITUATION.
I DON'T SEE
YOUR MEDICINE.
NO, I BROKE
THE BOTTLE.
ALL RIGHT.
- NO!
- I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE TIME
FOR YOU TO STOP TAKING
THIS LAUDANUM.
OH, WHAT A PLEASANT
SURPRISE, DOCTOR.
TO HEAR YOU ADMIT THE
LIMITS OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE.
HAVE YOU MADE
ANY TRAVEL PLANS?
BEFORE HIS MURDER,
MR. HICKOK ARRANGED
WITH A MR. BULLOCK
TO LOOK AFTER MY AFFAIRS HERE.
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'LL...
THAT'LL FREE YOU
UP TO LEAVE.
HAIR FROM THE HEATHEN
DEAD LESS THAN ONE DAY.
THESE ARE GOOD BOOTS
YOU PEOPLE SOLD ME.
GLAD YOU'RE SATISFIED.
HAIR FROM A HEATHEN
DEAD LESS THAN ONE DAY!
CUT THAT SHIT OUT!
NO LAW AGAINST ME
SELLING THESE, MISTER.
NO LAW EITHER AGAINST ME
BREAKING YOUR FUCKING JAW
IF YOU DON'T QUIT IT!
PUT HIM OUT HERE LIKE
A GODDAMNED CIRCUS FREAK!
WHOA, I'M NOT MAKING
A PENNY FROM THIS.
PEOPLE JUST WANTED
TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS.
WELL, I HAD HIM HERE
AROUND THE SIDE,
BUT THEY KNOCKED
THE DAMN TENT OVER.
MAN HAS
A POWERFUL TEMPER.
THAT HARDWARE COCKSUCKER'S
BEEN AN ONGOING PAIN IN MY BALLS
SINCE HIM AND HIS PARTNER
SHOWED UP.
WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE
THAT HEATHEN'S HEAD
GOT TO THEM TUFTS OF HAIR
CAME OFF OF, AL?
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
DIDN'T SOME MEXICAN BRING
THE HEAD IN FOR BOUNTY?
IF IT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU, I'LL
LOOK IT UP IN MY YESTERDAY'S DIARY.
COULDN'T MATTER LESS.
AS FAR AS
THE TRIAL ITSELF,
I GOT NO PROBLEM
ACTING AS HOST.
LOSS OF REVENUES
NOT WITHSTANDING.
WELL, I'M HAPPY
TO HAVE IT AT MY JOINT,
BUT BEING YOU'RE SENIOR
IN THE COMMUNITY,
IT SEEMS SOMEHOW...
OUT OF PLACE.
ANYWAYS,
WE'LL HAVE IT HERE.
BUT JUST LET ME SAY
THIS ONCE IN YOUR HEARING.
FOR OUT-RIGHT STUPIDITY,
THE WHOLE FUCKING TRIAL CONCEPT
GOES SHOULDER TO SHOULDER
WITH CUSTER'S THINKING WHEN
HE HEADED FOR THAT RIDGE.
IT'S GOT
ITS DISADVANTAGES.
WE'RE ILLEGAL.
OUR WHOLE GOAL IS TO GET
ANNEXED TO THE UNITED STATES.
WE START
HOLDING TRIALS,
WHAT'S TO KEEP THE UNITED
STATES CONGRESS FROM SAYING,
"OH EXCUSE US,
WE DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU WERE A SOVEREIGN
COMMUNITY AND NATION OUT THERE.
WHERE'S YOUR
COCKSUCKER'S FLAG?
WHERE'S YOUR FUCKING
NAVY OR THE LIKE?
MAYBE WHEN WE MAKE
OUR TREATY WITH THE SIOUX,
WE SHOULD TREAT YOU PEOPLE
LIKE RENEGADE INDIANS,
DENY YOUR GOLD AND PROPERTY CLAIMS
AND HAND EVERYTHING OVER INSTEAD
- TO OUR NE'ER-DO-WELL COUSINS AND
BROTHER'S-IN-LAW"? - THAT WE DON'T WANT.
BUT, IF WE'RE GONNA
HAVE THE FUCKING THING,
MIGHT AS WELL HAVE IT
IN MY JOINT, HUH?
TOM SMITH OF LEAD!
JUROR NUMBER SEVEN!
- HOW'S BUSINESS?
- HOT AND COLD.
STRUGGLING TO GET OUR CRAPS
CONCEPT OFF THE GROUND.
THAT'S THE WAY
WITH ANY NEW IDEA.
TAKES THE HOOPLE HEADS
TIME TO ADJUST.
- SAMUEL SMITH.
- SOMETIMES I WISH WE COULD JUST HIT 'EM OVER THE HEAD,
ROB 'EM AND THROW
THEIR BODIES IN THE CREEK.
BUT THAT WOULD
BE WRONG.
JAY JOHNSON,
SPEARFISH.
- MR. BULLOCK?
- DOC?
I JUST SEEN
MRS. GARRET.
I'VE GOT A PROXY
FOR HER TO SIGN.
YOU OUGHTTA GO AHEAD
AND GET THAT DONE SO SHE CAN
GO AHEAD AND LEAVE CAMP.
ANYTHING ELSE ON YOUR
SCHEDULE I'M BEHIND ON?
NO, SIR.
I WILL NOW DRAW FROM
THE LAWYER'S BUSINESS CARDS
IN THE BOX,
THE PRESIDING MAGISTRATE,
PROSECUTOR AND COUNSEL
AFTER THAT PART'S OVER,
AND NOT PRE-JUDGING
THE EVIDENCE...
WHY DON'T WE TRY
THE COCKSUCKER AT MY PLACE?
Cy:
SECOND.
A.W.: OFFICERS OF THE
COURT, MAGISTRATE...
THERE'S A CRIPPLE
WHO'D DO.
IF I COULD PRY HER
FROM MR. SWEARENGEN.
HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD
LOOSEN HIS GRIP?
MORE LIKELY AL WOULD BRIDLE
AT BREAKING HIS ROUTINE.
HE LIKES TO BERATE
THE GIMP MORNINGS.
I CANNOT SEE
TO THIS CHILD.
SHE NEEDS SOMEONE
LESS DISTRACTED.
I WISH TO SEE YOU
EXTRICATED FROM ALL THESE
COMPLICATIONS
AND DIFFICULTIES,
MRS. GARRET, AS MUCH
AS YOU DO YOURSELF.
OH, THANK YOU,
MR. FARNUM.
AND IN THAT REGARD,
WONDER IF YOU'VE
DECIDED ON MY BID
FOR YOUR CLAIM YET?
- ARE YOU MR. BULLOCK?
- YES.
I'M ALMA GARRET.
HOW DO YOU DO?
AH, PLEASE EXCUSE ME.
I'M SPREAD SO THIN
WITH MY COOK OUT.
I GOT THIS
FOR YOU TO SIGN.
HAVE YOU A PEN
AT THE DESK, MR. FARNUM?
CERTAINLY.
SEVERAL DAYS AGO
I WATCHED YOU
AND WILD BILL HICKOK
SUPPORT EACH OTHER
IN A GUNFIGHT FROM
THE WINDOW IN MY ROOM.
LATER,
WHEN MR. HICKOK
SPOKE SO HIGHLY,
MR. BULLOCK, I-
I IMAGINED IT WAS YOU.
MR. BULLOCK HAS
AUTHORITY TO ACT
ON MY BEHALF ON ALL MATTERS
RELATING TO THE CLAIM.
- I SEE.
- IN CASE YOU COULDN'T, I THOUGHT I'D TELL YOU.
WONDERFUL.
ONE LOAD OFF YOUR BACK.
LET ME SEE ABOUT
GETTING YOU THAT CRIPPLE.
IS HE DEAD OR ALIVE?
HE'S SICK.
AND WE AIN'T
NO HOSPITAL!
NUMBER EIGHT'S
RELOCATING.
BUNDLE HIM UP, PUT SOME
OF LEON'S REMEDY DOWN HIM
AND TAKE HIM
TO THE HILLS.
CAN SOMEONE ELSE DO IT,
MR. TOLLIVER?
SURE THEY CAN.
SHALL I GET SOMEONE
ELSE TO TAKE HIM?
NO, I'LL DO IT.
AND BURN THE BLANKET
AFTERWARDS.
THANKS, BART.
SOME DO GET WELL, CY.
HIS CHANCES WILL
IMPROVE OUTDOORS.
THE BRACING AIR.
WHAT ARE YOU MOVING
THE TABLES FOR?
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
THE JURY RIGHT HERE.
CAN'T THEY SIT
AT SEPARATE TABLES?
DO YOU WANT THE TABLES
TOGETHER, OR NOT?
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING DONE
THAT CAN'T BE UNDONE
FIVE MINUTES AFTER
THIS FIASCO CONCLUDES.
CLEAN SOMEWHERE
WHERE I CAN'T SEE YOU.
GO ON,
GET FUCKING!
HAVE PATIENCE
WITH THE WIDOW, AL.
SHE'S GIVE HER PROXY
TO THAT HARDWARE FELLA.
HICKOK BREAKS MY BALLS
FROM THE AFTERLIFE.
YOU FEEL,
BEFORE HE WAS MURDERED,
HICKOK ENLISTED BULLOCK
IN THE WIDOW'S CAUSE?
ADVANCE THE SUBJECT
OR PICK UP A BROOM.
SIGNING A PROXY DON'T MEAN
THE WIDOW CAN'T DO A DEAL.
IF THE WIDOW TRUSTS
HER OWN JUDGMENT,
SHE DON'T LET HICKOK BRING THE
HARDWARE COCKSUCKER INTO IT.
SHE'S TRYING
TO GET OFF THE DOPE.
MAYBE LOADED
SHE'D GET HER
SELF-CONFIDENCE BACK.
LET ME CAMP BENEATH
HER WINDOW AND SUGGEST THAT.
HICKOK'S HALF-WOMAN FRIEND'S
OFF SOMEWHERES ON A TEAR.
THE ORPHAN SQUAREHEAD'S
IN THE WIDOW'S CARE.
THE WIDOW FEELS
PUT UPON.
SHE'S ASKED ME
TO FIND HER SOME HELP.
I SUGGESTED THE GIMP.
NO!
SO AS NOT TO PUT
A WHORE UP FIRST OFF.
NOW, I WILL
PROPOSE TRIXIE.
AS A GET ACQUAINTED GIFT,
SHE COULD BRING THE WIDOW
A GOOD-SIZED BALL OF DOPE.
YES.
WELL THOUGHT
THROUGH, E.B.
TELL THE WIDOW
YOU HAVE A CANDIDATE.
I HAVE TO GO
LOOK TO MY ROAST.
MY COOK'S ON THE QUEUE
TO SEE HICKOK'S REMAINS.
THEN HE'LL PROBABLY
SNEAK HERE FOR THE TRIAL.
OOPS.
Seth:
REVEREND.
UH, SIR.
SIR, WHO STANDS
FOR MR. HICKOK?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- MR. UTTER HAS GONE TO CHEYENNE.
AND I DON'T FIND
MR. HICKOK'S WOMAN FRIEND.
MR. NUTTALL
COMMISSIONED THE COFFIN,
BUT WISHES NOT
TO PARTICIPATE FURTHER.
NOW I NEED GUIDANCE
IN CERTAIN MATTERS.
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHO STANDS FOR HIM.
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO FIND OUT?
FOR EXAMPLE, I THOUGHT
"HOW FIRM A FOUNDATION."
FOR THE HYMN.
SOUNDS A GOOD CHOICE.
- DO YOU THINK SO?
- YES, I DO.
- MIGHT SOMETHING ELSE BE MORE APPROPRIATE?
- I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK "HOW FIRM
A FOUNDATION"
FOR THE HYMN
AND FROM THE GOSPEL,
- FIRST CORINTHIANS 12.
- ALL RIGHT.
"IF THE FOOT SHALL SAY
BECAUSE I AM NOT THE HAND,
I'M NOT OF THE BODY, IS IT
THEREFORE NOT OF THE BODY?
AND IF THE EAR SHALL SAY
BECAUSE I'M NOT THE EYE
I'M NOT OF THE BODY,
IS IT THEREFORE NOT?
NOW HATH GOD SET THE
MEMBERS, EVERYONE OF THEM,
IN THE BODY AS IT
HATH PLEASED HIM."
THAT IS A GOOD CHOICE,
REVEREND.
ARE WE OPEN
FOR BUSINESS?
- I KNOW YOU.
- I KNOW YOU, TOO.
AFTER BUMRUSHIN' ME OUTTA YOUR
FINE HARDWARE ESTABLISHMENT,
YOU DIDN'T SEE
THIS COMIN', DID YOU?
I HALFWAY DID,
YOU DROOP-EYED COCKSUCKER!
I WAS BORN DROOP-EYED,
ALL RIGHT?
AND WHO DO YOU BLAME
FOR THE REST OF THE MESS?
LET ME ASK YOU THIS,
COCKSUCKER,
YOU THINK THEY KNOW ME
IN NEW YORK CITY BY NOW?
-
- IF YOU WASN'T TIED UP I WOULD KILL YA!
OW, WHAT ARE YOU
CRYIN' FOR?
- WHAT?
- I'M ASKIN' WHAT YOU'RE CRYIN' FOR?
DID YOU LOVE
HICKOK SO MUCH?
WAS YOU SWEETHEARTS?
DID HE STICK
HIS DICK UP YOUR ASS?
Man:
HEY, HEY!
I'M THIS MAN'S COUNSEL.
THEY WILL PIN
A ROSE ON YOU.
BOY, I'LL SHAKE
YOUR HAND.
I'M ALL TRUSSED UP
LIKE A CHRISTMAS PIG.
I WOULD SAY YOU'RE BETTER
SITUATED THAN YOUR COMPANIONS.
WELL, I'M A HARD CASE
FOR YOU, COUNSELOR.
AND NO MISTAKE,
EVERYONE IN THERE
SAW ME SHOOT HIM.
IF YOU'LL LET ME
SET OUR STRATEGY,
I DON'T THINK WE'LL
DISPUTE WHAT PEOPLE SAW.
NOW, I GUESS YOU'RE
HERE TO BREAK ME OUT.
SON, DID
JAMES BUTLER HICKOK
EVER KILL
A RELATIVE OF YOURS?
JAMES BUTLER HICKOK?
WILD BILL HICKOK.
DID HE EVER KILL A BROTHER
OF YOURS OR THE LIKE?
- A BROTHER?
- I'M ASKING YOU
IF WHAT HAPPENED
IN THAT SALOON
WAS VENGEANCE FOR THE
DEATH OF A FAMILY MEMBER.
POSSIBLY A BROTHER
IN ABILENE,
OR THE LIKE.
A BROTHER IN ABILENE.
OH, JESUS.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
LOOK, I'M SORRY AS HELL
ABOUT ALL THIS.
I'M NOT GONNA BURN THE
FUCKING BLANKET. FUCK CY!
LOOK, THIS IS NOT
MY FUCKING FAULT.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.
AH, CHRIST.
AH, GOD TAKE ME!
WHAT DO YOU
LOOK AT OUT THERE?
WHATEVER I CAN SEE.
CLEAN UP.
AM I ON JURY DUTY?
PUT ON A DECENT ENOUGH DRESS
TO HELP A WIDOW WITH A KID.
WHAT WIDOW IN CAMP
HAS A KID?
THE WIDOW IS THE NEW YORK
DUDE'S WIDOW.
THE KID IS THE ORPHAN
SQUAREHEAD.
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS
CARING FOR THAT CHILD NOW.
DOES IT CHANGE WHAT
FUCKING DRESS YOU WEAR?
NO.
WIDOW'S A DOPE FIEND.
SHE'S BEEN
DRINKING IT.
HELP HER EXPAND
HER HORIZONS.
I SEE NO GUARD
OUTSIDE OF ROOM EIGHT.
YEAH, ROOM EIGHT LEFT.
BORNE BY ANGELS?
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT MAN
TO WORRY ABOUT ANYMORE.
YOU OR ME EITHER.
JUST...
PUT THE MAN IN ROOM EIGHT
FROM YOUR MIND.
I HAVE NO VACCINE
FOR THE SICKNESS THE MAN
IN ROOM EIGHT DIDN'T HAVE.
THE CLOSEST
PLACE THAT DOES,
TO MY KNOWLEDGE,
IS FORT KEARNEY.
IF YOU WANT TO REMEDY
THE EPIDEMIC THAT YOU HAVE NO
REASON TO BELIEVE WILL BREAK OUT,
I WOULD SEND SOMEBODY
THERE RIGHT AWAY.
HEARD YOU LOUD
AND CLEAR, DOCTOR.
WILL YOU SEND SOMEONE,
MR. TOLLIVER?
IF I DO, YOU'LL BE
THE FIRST TO KNOW.
IF YOU DON'T,
AND I HAVE TO,
THAT WILL BE KNOWN TO EVERY
DAMN PERSON IN THIS CAMP!
JOEY?
YOU EVER HAD
NEBRASKA PUSSY?
NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE,
MR. TOLLIVER.
EDDIE SAWYER,
GET IN HERE!
TRUE OR NOT, EDDIE,
WHEN A MAN WETS HIS END
IN NEBRASKA PUSSY,
HIS LIFE IS
CHANGED FOREVER.
SPEAKING ONLY
FOR MYSELF,
I STILL MARK
THE ANNIVERSARY.
WELL, POINT ME
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
YOU HEAR THAT, EDDIE?
BOY'S GOT
A HEALTHY ATTITUDE.
YES, SIR?
COME HERE.
GET THIS OUTTA HERE.
GET RID OF IT?
DID YOU HEAR ME ANNOUNCE
THE OTHER NIGHT
THAT I'D PAY A $50 BOUNTY
FOR EVERY INDIAN HEAD?
- I WAS RIGHT NEXT TO YOU, AL.
- THAT'S THE FIRST HEAD.
SOME CHILI CHOMPER'S
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE
RIGHT NOW SPENDING
MY $50.
YOU GET RID OF THAT HEAD,
OR YOU'D BETTER KNOW
OF ANOTHER PLACE WITH
A POSITION OPEN FOR AN IDIOT.
ALL RIGHT.
GOT A COUPLE PLACES
I CAN KEEP IT, I GUESS.
YEAH, TILL AFTER
THE TRIAL.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
DO WITH IT THEN?
PUT IT SOMEWHERE
IN THE BAR?
IT'S A NICE
CONVERSATION PIECE.
I MEAN IF IT'S HANDLED
THE RIGHT WAY.
YOU HAVE BEEN TESTED,
AL SWEARENGEN.
AND YOUR DEEPEST
PURPOSES PROVED
THERE'S GOLD
ON THE WOMAN'S CLAIM.
YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE
SHOUTED IT FROM THE ROOFTOPS.
"THAT'S WHY I'M JUMPING
THROUGH HOOPS TO GET IT BACK.
THOROUGH AS I FLEECED
THE FOOL SHE MARRIED,
I WILL FLEECE
HIS WIDOW, TOO,
USING LOYAL
ASSOCIATES LIKE
EUSTACE BAILEY FARNUM
AS MY GO-BETWEENS AND DUPES.
TO EXPLAIN
WHY I WANT HER BOUGHT OUT
I WILL MAKE A PRETEXT OF
MY FEAR OF THE PINKERTONS.
I WILL THROW FARNUM
A TOKEN THIEF.
WHY SHOULD
I REWARD E.B.
WITH SOME
SMALL FRACTIONAL
PARTICIPATION
IN THE CLAIM?
OR LET HIM EVEN LAY BY
A LITTLE SECURITY
AND SOURCE OF CONTINUING
INCOME FOR HIS DECLINING YEARS?
WHAT'S HE EVER
DONE FOR ME?
EXCEPT LET ME
TERRIFY HIM
EVERY GODDAMNED DAY
OF HIS LIFE
TILL THE IDEA
OF BOWEL REGULARITY
IS A FORLORN
FUCKING HOPE.
NOT TO MENTION ORDERING A MAN
KILLED IN ONE OF E.B.'S ROOMS.
SO EVERY FUCKING
FREE MOMENT OF HIS LIFE
E.B. HAS TO SPEND
SCRUBBING THE BLOODSTAINS
OFF THE GODDAMNED FLOOR!
TO KEEP FROM...
HAVING TO LOWER
HIS RATES."
GOD DAMN THAT MOTHERFUCKER!
-
-
RULES OF THE COURT.
NO NONSENSE.
PROSECUTION WILL OPEN.
THE DEFENSE WILL RESPOND.
THE JURY WILL BE CHARGED
AND DELIBERATE.
GO AHEAD.
WE SHOULDER A GREAT
WEIGHT HERE TODAY.
NOW WE'RE MANY
OF US MINERS,
BUT THIS IS NO
CLAIM DISPUTE.
- CHRISTMAS.
- HMM?
WE'LL BE HERE TILL
FUCKING CHRISTMAS.
YESTERDAY,
A MAN OF REPUTATION
WAS KILLED IN THIS CAMP.
NOW THE KILLER
HAD NO REPUTATION.
BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES
SPEAK BADLY ENOUGH
ABOUT HIS
CHARACTER THAT,
IN TIME TO COME,
HE MAY GET ONE.
EVEN THOUGH
THE KILLER IS A COWARD,
NOT ALL KILLINGS
ARE MURDERS.
YOU JURORS HAVE TO DECIDE
IF THIS KILLING WAS.
AND YOUR DECISION
WILL COME TO THIS:
EITHER A MAN
GIVING YOU A DOLLAR
FOR BREAKFAST IS PROVOCATION
BEYOND ENDURANCE,
OR JACK McCALL
SHOOTING WILD BILL HICKOK
WAS MURDER,
PURE AND SIMPLE.
PICKED UP HIS PACE
TOWARDS THE END.
GO AHEAD.
SIR.
WHY'D YOU KILL
HICKOK, MR. McCALL?
HE MURDERED
MY BROTHER IN KANSAS.
MURDERED YOUR
BROTHER IN KANSAS.
THANK YOU, SON.
HMM.
DON'T COUNT YOUR
FUCKING CHICKENS.
GO AHEAD.
WHEN DID HICKOK MURDER
YOUR BROTHER, MR. McCALL?
IN KANSAS, ABILENE.
ARE YOU STILL DRUNK?
-
- I SAID WHEN?
I DON'T RECALL
THE EXACT YEAR.
WHEN THEY WAS
BOTH IN ABILENE.
Jack:
NOT AT SHOOTING, NO.
BUT YOU WERE IN ABILENE AT
THE TIME THAT THIS HAPPENED?
NO, WHEN THE SHOOTING
HAPPENED, NO.
TELL THAT JUDGE
I WANT TO SEE HIM.
- WERE YOU EVER IN ABILENE?
- YES.
WELL DO YOU OFTEN
PLAY CARDS, McCALL,
FOR THREE DAYS WITH A MAN
WHO MURDERED YOUR BROTHER
BEFORE IN PASSION'S
WHITE HEAT
YOU TAKE YOUR REVENGE?
NO, IT WASN'T
WHITE HEAT.
I HAD TO FIND
MY CHANCE.
IF THAT'S IT, I'M CALLING
A BREAK FOR NATURE
DO YOU EVEN HAVE
A BROTHER, MR. McCALL?
YEAH, AND HICKOK
KILLED HIM.
BREAK FOR NATURE.
SIR?
SIR?
BULLET THAT KILLED HICKOK
IS IN MY WRIST.
ANY CHANCE
I COULD TESTIFY?
McCALL ALREADY ADMITTED
HE KILLED HICKOK.
YEARS TO COME WHEN I'M
GIVING TALKS OR THE LIKE,
I'D APPRECIATE IF I'D BE ON THE RECORD.
THERE'S $50
IN IT FOR YOU.
I'D BE TELLING
THE TRUTH, SIR!
Trixie:
MRS. GARRET?
IT'S OKAY.
WHO IS IT?
I'M SENT TO HELP YOU
WITH THE LITTLE ONE.
I'M TRIXIE.
THANK YOU FOR COMING AT
SUCH SHORT NOTICE, TRIXIE.
AIN'T YOU PRETTY?
I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR HUSBAND, MA'AM.
IT'S GOOD OF YOU
TO CARE FOR THE CHILD.
I WAS UNDER THE
IMPRESSION YOU WERE HURT.
MA'AM?
MR. FARNUM SAID
YOU HAD SOME SORT OF
PHYSICAL LIABILITY?
I'M NOT HER. SHE'S
LOVELY, THOUGH, JEWEL.
MAY I WASH HER?
GIVE HER A NICE BATH?
OF COURSE.
ALL RIGHT,
LITTLE ONE.
SHE DOESN'T
SPEAK ENGLISH.
I'M TRIXIE.
TRIXIE.
YOU WANT A BLOWJOB
WHILE I TALK TO YOU?
NO.
I WASN'T OFFERING IT
PERSONALLY.
MAKE YOUR POINT.
MY POINT IS...
BEFORE A GUILTY VERDICT
WOULD GET EXECUTED
ON THAT COCKSUCKER,
THREE MEN WOULD
WALK IN THAT MEAT LOCKER
WHERE HE'S BEING HELD
WITH BAGS OVER THEIR HEADS
AND CUT HIS THROAT.
WITHIN HALF AN HOUR THOSE
CELESTIAL LITTLE PIGS WILL BE
ON THEIR BACKS
WITH THEIR HOOVES IN THE AIR
BELCHING UP
HUMAN REMAINS.
ARE YOU SAYING YOU'D
ORDER THAT TO BE DONE?
I'M SAYING
I HAD A VISION
IT WOULD HAPPEN.
MY SECOND OF THE DAY.
FIRST COME WHEN
I WAS WATCHING YOU
AND THEM LAWYERS
ON LINE THIS MORNING.
THEY BEGAN TO SLITHER
IN MY SIGHT LIKE VIPERS.
SO AS NOT TO PUKE
I HAD TO CLOSE MY EYES.
THE VISION WENT ON.
GOT WORSE.
I SAW THE VIPERS IN
THE BIG NEST IN WASHINGTON.
THEY WERE TAKING US
IN THE CAMP
FOR ACTING LIKE WE COULD SET
OUR OWN LAWS UP OR ORGANIZATIONS.
AND THEN I SAW THE BIG VIPER
DECIDE TO STRANGLE
AND SWALLOW US UP AND EVERY
FUCKING THING WE GAIN HERE.
IT WAS HORRIBLE.
HOW COULD WE
FUCKING AVOID IT?
HOW COULD WE LET THE VIPERS
IN THE BIG NEST KNOW
THAT WE DIDN'T WANNA CAUSE
ANY FUCKING TROUBLE?
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU
HAD YOUR SECOND VISION?
YEAH, THE CUTTHROATS
AND THE PIGS.
BUT WHO WANTS ALL THAT
BLOOD SPILLED, JUDGE?
ISN'T THERE A SIMPLER WAY
OF NOT PISSING OFF
THE BIG VIPERS?
I WANT TO GET BACK
TO THE TRIAL.
GO AHEAD.
HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE
THE TRIAL'S GOING?
- I DON'T KNOW.
- SHOULD'VE TOOK HIM INTO THE TERRITORY.
HANG 'EM HERE, THEY'LL BE
OPENING A CAN A WORMS.
GUESS IT'S ALL
A CAN A WORMS.
NOW YOU'RE TALKING.
WILL YOU HELP ME
WITH THE BODY?
GOOD TALK?
WE'LL SEE.
MM.
YOU SEE THAT ONE?
HIM, THAT ONE THERE
IN THE MIDDLE.
- THE CURLY HAIR?
- YEAH, YEAH.
TOLD ME THE OTHER NIGHT HOW
BAD HICKOK NEEDED KILLING.
YEAH.
SAID HICKOK INSULTED HIM
IN THE STREET.
HOPE HE'S GOT
A FORCEFUL PERSONALITY.
WE'RE BACK
IN SESSION.
THIS CAMP IS PART OF NO
TERRITORY, STATE OR NATION.
STARS AND STRIPES
MAY FLY HERE SOON,
BUT THAT DAY
IS NOT HERE YET.
YOU OF THE JURY THEREFORE
ARE WITHOUT THE LAW
UPON WHICH
TO DECIDE THIS CASE.
AND HOW THEN
ARE YOU TO DECIDE IT?
YOU MUST RELY
ON COMMON CUSTOM.
THAT McCALL KILLED HICKOK
IS NOT IN DISPUTE.
HE SAYS HE WAS
TAKING REVENGE,
THAT HICKOK
MURDERED HIS BROTHER.
IF YOU BELIEVE WHAT
HE SAYS TO BE TRUE
CUSTOM DICTATES
THAT YOU EXCUSE HIM.
THE JURY WILL NOW RETIRE
TO THE WHORES' ROOMS
AND BEGIN THEIR
DELIBERATIONS.
- SUPPOSE ELLSWORTH'S WITH US?
- OH YEAH, FOUR SQUARE.
OPEN THE BAR.
GET THE GIRLS FUCKING
TILL THE JURY COMES BACK.
THE DOWNSTAIRS ROOMS
IS OCCUPIED.
UPSTAIRS AIN'T.
TRUE.
Andy:
STRIKE ME DEAD.
PLEASE,
I HURT SO MUCH NOW.
YOU'RE ONE SICK
FUCKING CUSTOMER.
I APOLOGIZE.
DON'T APOLOGIZE
TO ME.
I DON'T EVEN
FUCKING KNOW YA!
YOU WANT A DRINK
OF WHISKEY?
AND NO LIPPIN'
THE BOTTLE,
BUT I GOT A PRETTY
STEADY POURING HAND.
I APOLOGIZE.
ACCEPTED.
OPEN YOUR YAP!
HEY!
OPEN UP!
MORE FOR ME
ANYHOW.
I APOLOGIZE.
HEY.
MY BEST FRIEND DIED.
THE MAN I HAD MY BEST
FRIEND-FEELING ABOUT IN THE WORLD.
TOOK YOU AS HE FOUND YOU,
THOUGHT THE BEST OF YOU.
SWEET TO ME!
I APOLOGIZE.
MAYBE YOU WOULD
RATHER HAVE SOME WATER?
I WILL GO GET SOME
FROM THE CREEK.
BUT IF YOU DON'T
STOP 'POLOGIZING,
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU
A GODDAMN DROP.
ALL RIGHT, MISTER?!
I'M COMING BACK
WITH SOME WATER.
I APOLOGIZE.
SHUT THE FUCK UP!
LOOK HOW PRETTY
YOU ARE.
PRETTY GIRL.
ARE YOU POORLY?
CRAMPY?
YES.
DOES LAUDANUM HELP?
IT USED TO.
IT DOESN'T ANYMORE.
ARE YOU AFRAID?
YES.
I WAS AWFUL AFRAID
WHEN I WAS STOPPING.
FIRST I WAS AFRAID
I WAS GONNA DIE.
AND THEN I WAS
AFRAID I WOULDN'T.
AND THEN ONE DAY
I WOKE UP...
FREE.
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I DIDN'T THINK TO PUT HER
IN ONE OF MY CAMISOLES.
NO, BUT YOU LOOK HOW
PRETTY SHE LOOKS IN IT.
LOOK AT HER.
MAY I CONFIDE?
CERTAINLY.
I'VE NEVER BEEN
LAID IN NEBRASKA.
WE ALL OF US
SOMETIMES EMBELLISH.
I FEEL UNBURDENED.
HAPPY TO HELP.
WHAT DID YOU
SEND HIM TO GET?
IF I HAVEN'T
SAID YET, EDDIE,
YOU THINK ASKING'S
GONNA MAKE ME?
LOOK AT THE LADY.
IT'S QUIET, I THOUGHT
I WOULD SEE HICKOK BURIED.
SURE.
SURE, WHAT?
SURE, JOANIE,
GO AHEAD.
OR WAS YOUR POINT YOU
WEREN'T ASKING PERMISSION?
CONSCIENCE STRUCK.
NEEDS TO SING A HYMN.
SHE LIKED ANDY.
I DID TOO.
-
- DOC?
I'M IN THE BACK!
WELL, I WON'T
TROUBLE NOTHING.
- HI, DOC.
- WHAT IS IT?
COUPLE YEARS AGO
I TOOK POWDERS.
GETTING SOME
AWFUL CRAMPING.
- I WISH I KNEW WHAT WAS IN 'EM.
- THAT'D BE HELPFUL.
BROWNISH LIKE.
I PUT 'EM
IN MY TEA.
WELL, IF IT'S THE MONTHLY'S,
I GENERALLY PRESCIBE
A DAY OR TWO OF LAUDANUM
AGAINST THE CRAMPS.
COMING OFF THE LAUDANUM'S
WHAT HAD ME CRAMPY.
THEN YOU USED IT FOR
MORE THAN A FEW DAYS.
LITTLE LONGER, YEAH.
BETWEEN 12 AND...
HOWEVER OLD I WAS
THREE YEARS AGO.
HAVE YOU TAKEN 'EM
BACK UP AGAIN?
IT'S THE RICH WOMAN
WANTS TO STOP.
- THE WIDOW.
- AND WHAT'S THAT TO YOU?
OR TO YOU
WHY I BE INTERESTED?
I WON'T SWEAR
THIS IS YOUR
SOVEREIGN REMEDY.
BUT THE COLOR
WILL BE RIGHT.
AND IT SHOULD
GIVE HER SOME RELIEF.
THANKS, DOC.
IT'S A LITTLE ENOUGH
TO DO WITH WHAT'S COMING.
WHAT WOULD THAT BE?
AND WHAT WOULD
THAT BE TO YOU?
FINISH YOUR BUSINESS.
THE JURY'S COMING BACK.
HURRY IT UP!
WHAT'S THE VERDICT?
INNOCENT.
Judge:
THANK YOU.
THE DEFENDANT
IS FREE.
DON'T EVER KNOCK
THIS CAMP TO ME.
GOOD LUCK, SON.
Man:
I NEED A DRINK.
Reverend: MR. HICKOK WILL
LIE BESIDE TWO BROTHERS.
ONE HE LIKELY KILLED,
THE OTHER HE KILLED
FOR CERTAIN AND HE'S
BEEN KILLED NOW IN TURN.
SO MUCH BLOOD.
AND ON THE BATTLEFIELDS
OF THE BROTHER'S WAR,
I SAW MORE BLOOD
THAN THIS.
AND ASKED THEN AS FOR THE
PURPOSE, AND DID NOT KNOW.
AND DON'T KNOW
THE PURPOSE NOW.
BUT KNOW NOW TO TESTIFY
THAT NOT KNOWING,
I BELIEVE.
SAINT PAUL TELLS US
BY ONE'S SPIRIT
ARE WE ALL BAPTIZED
IN THE ONE BODY.
WHETHER WE BE JEW OR
GENTILE, BOND OR FREE.
AND HAVE ALL BEEN MADE
TO DRINK INTO ONE SPIRIT.
FOR THE BODY IS NOT ONE MEMBER,
BUT MANY.
HE TELLS US, "THE EYE
CANNOT SAY UNTO THE HAND,
'I HAVE NO NEED
OF THEE.'
NOR AGAIN,
THE HEAD TO THE FEET,
'I HAVE NO NEED OF THEE.'
THEY MUCH MORE
THOSE MEMBERS OF THE BODY
WHICH SEEM TO BE
MORE FEEBLE.
AND THOSE
MEMBERS OF THE BODY
WHICH WE THINK
OF AS LESS HONORABLE,
ALL ARE NECESSARY."
HE SAYS THAT THERE SHOULD
BE NO SCHISM IN THE BODY,
BUT THAT THE MEMBERS SHOULD HAVE
THE SAME CARE, ONE TO ANOTHER.
AND WHERE THE ONE
MEMBER SUFFER,
ALL THE MEMBERS
SUFFER WITH IT.
I BELIEVE
IN GOD'S PURPOSE,
NOT KNOWING IT.
I ASK HIM,
MOVING IN ME,
TO ALLOW ME
TO SEE HIS WILL.
I ASK HIM,
MOVING IN OTHERS,
LET US SING
"HOW FIRM A FOUNDATION"
AS MR. HICKOK
IS LAID TO REST.
All:
* WHEN THROUGH
* FIERY TRIALS
* THY PATHWAYS SHALL LIE
* MY GRACE
* ALL SUFFICIENT
* SHALL BE THY SUPPLY
* THE FLAME
* SHALL NOT HURT THEE
* I ONLY DESIGN...
THEY TURNED
HIM LOOSE.
- McCALL?
- THEY TURNED HIM LOOSE.
* AND THY GOLD
TO REFINE. *
- CAN WE GET STARTED?
- HE'S NEAR DONE.
OH, YOU CAN TELL?
CAN YOU BELIEVE THEY LET
THE SON OF A BITCH GO?
YEAH, I GUESS I CAN.
HERE HE COMES.
OH, THANK YOU
FOR WAITING.
YOU'VE BEEN SO KIND
TO ME, A STRANGER.
MANY OF US HAVE
ASKED BEING BROKEN,
HOW ARE WE TO LIVE?
YOU TOOK ME INTO
THE BODY OF THE CAMP.
I'M FROM
ETOBICOKE, ONTARIO.
I'M FROM
VIENNA, AUSTRIA.
MAY I ASK,
MR. BULLOCK,
WHAT YOU FEEL NOW
MAY BE YOUR PART?
CAN'T SAY I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
I WOULD NOT IMPOSE,
IT'S BEEN GIVEN ME TO ASK.
YOU DID WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN GIVEN TO DO.
THE CAMP WAS LUCKY YOU
WERE HERE TODAY.
NO, I'M A FRAIL
AND FEEBLE VESSEL,
BUT NONE OF US CAN
DENY OUR PARTS-
CAN WE FINISH THE
GODDAMNED WALK IN QUIET?
CERTAINLY, SIR.
SORRY, REVEREND.
CAN I GET YOUR AUTOGRAPH
PLEASE?
THERE YOU GO,
THAT'S FOR YOU.
SHOULD IT EVER BE
YOUR MISFORTUNE,
GENTLEMEN, OR MINE
TO NEED TO KILL A MAN,
THEN LET US
TOAST TOGETHER
THE POSSIBILITY
THAT OUR TRIALS
BE HELD IN THIS CAMP.
Man:
HERE, HERE.
Al: WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
IT'S JACK, AIN'T IT?
YES, SIR.
YOU BUY ME A DRINK,
I'LL MAKE MY MARK.
STICK AROUND CAMP, JACK.
I WILL MAKE MINE FOR YOU.
WHAT IN THE HELL'S
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
MEANS THERE'S A HORSE FOR
YOU OUTSIDE YOU WANT TO GET ON
BEFORE SOMEBODY MURDERS
YOU WHO GIVES A FUCK
ABOUT RIGHT
AND WRONG, OR I DO.
IT'S THE PAINT, JACK.
RIGHT OUTSIDE MY JOINT.
RUN FOR YOUR
FUCKING LIFE.
JACK McCALL
RUNS FROM NO MAN.
REMEMBER THIS WHEN
YOU RUN YOUR OWN PLACE.
THAT TYPE GUY HANGING ROUND
GETS PEOPLE AGITATED.
FORCES 'EM TO TAKE
A POSITION,
ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER.
AND AGITATION
BRINGS A SLIGHT BUMP
UP IN WHISKEY SALES.
BUT THE SALE
OF CUNT PLUMMETS.
THAT'S WHY I OFTEN
WONDER IF I SHOULD TAKE
THAT FUCKING PICTURE
OF LINCOLN DOWN.
COME ON.
Jack:
YAH, YAH.
IT'S ME, MISTER!
BACK WITH WATER.
ARE YOU DEAD?!
YEAH!
THERE YOU ARE.
CHOKING AND COUGHING
JUST LIKE THE REST OF US.
SAW THE WIDOW'S
HUSBAND IN THE CREEK.
'LESS THEY'RE KEEPING
MORE THAN ONE BODY COOL
FOR SHIPPING BACK EAST.
TEATHERED,
WRAPPED UP,
AND FLOATING
LIKE A LURE
FOR SOME HUGE
FUCKING FISH.
THE WIDOW'S GOT
THE LITTLE ONE NOW.
I HAD HER FOR AWHILE,
BUT I AIN'T THE TYPE
SHE SHOULD BE WITH LONG TERM.
FUCKING DRUNK
AND SO FORTH.
AND WHEN I WAS
DOWN AT THE CREEK
I HEARD VOICES
AND I WENT TO WHERE
THEY WERE SINGING.
AND I SAW AS THEY LAID
MY POOR BILL TO REST.
NOW THERE'S A BIRD
I AIN'T NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
SHALL I TALK
ABOUT IT TO YOU?
THE MAN IS A LUNATIC.
HIGH WATER, HE NEVER
MADE MUCH SENSE.
BUT NOW HE JUST UTTERS
PURE GIBBERISH.
DID HE LOOK
PALE TO YOU?
- WHAT?
- DID HE SEEM PALE?
HOW THE FUCK DO I KNOW
IF HE WAS PALE OR NOT?
- HE LOOKED PALE TO ME.
- WHAT IF HE WAS?
LET'S SAY HE WAS. WILL
YOU SHUT UP ABOUT IT?
WHAT IS MY PART
AND YOUR PART?
WHAT PART OF MY PART
IS YOUR PART?
IS MY FOOT YOUR KNEE?
WHAT ABOUT YOUR EAR?
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?
YEAH.
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DON'T YOU KNOW?
WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO DO.
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO DO ANYTHING!
LET'S AGREE TO THAT.
NOT ONE FUCKING THING THAT
I DON'T DECIDE I'M GONNA.
ALL RIGHT, SOL?
ALL RIGHT.
SUSPENDERS.
GOD DAMN IT!
IF I KILL THE DROOP-EYED SON OF A BITCH
AND MY PARTS
GETTING HANGED FOR IT,
GOOD LUCK WITH
THE FUCKING STORE.
ALL RIGHT.
I WILL WRITE TO MARTHA
AND SEE IT POSTED.
- YOU LOOK OUT AFTER THAT WIDOW.
- ALL RIGHT, SETH.
CAN I IMPOSE ON YOU
TO PACK A BAG FOR ME
TO CUT DOWN ON THE
COCKSUCKER'S HEAD START?
BE READY FOR YOU
WHEN YOU RIDE OUT.
THANKS, SOL.
DID YOU GET THE PRAYING
OUTTA YOUR SYSTEM?
YAH!
* GOD AND MAN PLAYED
HIDE AND GO SEEK *
* GOD GO, "MAN NOW,
MAN, DON'T YOU PEEK" *
* HA HA HA,
THAT'S RIGHT *
* HA HA HA,
I'M BIGGER THAN THEE *
