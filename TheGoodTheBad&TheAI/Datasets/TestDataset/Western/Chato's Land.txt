HI, ELI.
ELI.
MORNING, GEORGE.
THIS IS A WHITE
MAN'S SALOON,
AND IT SELLS
WHITE MAN'S LIQUOR,
AND I'M TELLING YOU
TO CRAWL YOUR FILTH
OUT OF HERE, BREED...
BEFORE I KILL YOU.
HA HA HA HA.
DO YOU HEAR,
YOU RED-SKINNED
NIGGER?
A WHITE MAN'S
TALKING TO YOU.
YOU NEED
STEPPING
ON, BREED.
BACK OFF, LAWMAN.
YOU HEAR THAT, GEORGE?
I'M GONNA
BLEED YOU, BOY.
JESUS!
I'LL GET
QUINCEY WHITMORE.
SOME INDIAN,
I THINK.
ELI'S BEEN
SHOT DEAD, CAPTAIN.
SOME INJUN.
HE'S RUN.
AN INJUN, YOU SAY?
ELI'S BEEN SHOT!
APACHE.
I'LL GET
WILL COOP.
HE WOULDN'T WANT
TO MISS THIS.
THE SHERIFF'S DEAD.
GONNA GET
THAT INJUN,
QUINCEY?
WHO IS IT?
NYE?
WHAT IS IT,
QUINCEY?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
SAUNDERS, JUST
BEEN KILLED.
IT WON'T STOP
THE WORLD A-TURNING.
AH!
NOW THEN,
AIN'T YOU A PICTURE?
AN INJUN SHOT HIM.
OH, AND YOU GOT DRESSED UP
FOR THE HANGING, HUH?
WELL, WE'LL HAVE
TO CATCH HIM FIRST.
GET YOUR PANTS.
YEAH.
GETTING NIGHT,
QUINCEY.
ALL WE HAVE
IS SAND
IN THE MOUTH,
AND THE HORSES
ARE TIRED SORE.
HOW'S HARVEY'S
HORSE?
UH, THREW A SHOE
AND A HOOF'S SPLIT.
AIN'T NOTHING
FOR US, QUINCEY.
WE GOT TO
TURN BACK
OR BED DOWN
OUT HERE.
WELL...
WE COULD GO
TO THE HOOKER
BROTHERS' PLACE.
ONLY ABOUT 10,
WE CAN NIGHT
THERE.
AAH!
AW, COME ON,
HONEY.
IT AIN'T GONNA
HURT NONE.
JUST GIVE ME
A LITTLE HONEY.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, I'LL TAN
YOUR HIDE,
DO YOU HEAR ME?
HEY, JUBAL,
HEY, JUBAL,
BY ALL THAT'S HOLY!
I'LL TAKE THE SKIN OFF YOU,
YOU DON'T BIDE
WHAT I SAY.
AH!
YOU'RE DAMN CRAZY!
SHE'S KIN.
COME ON,
GET BACK TO THE HOUSE.
AH!
WHAT'S WITH
THAT FOOL DOG?
RIDERS COMING,
JUBAL.
EARL!
LOOKS LIKE
CAPTAIN QUINCEY.
YOU'VE BEEN UP
TO SOMETHING ELSE?
THERE'S NOTHING
TOUCHING ME, JUBAL.
QUINCEY,
YOU'RE RIDING LATE.
POSSE, JUBAL.
WE'RE HOPING TO PUT DOWN
HERE FOR THE NIGHT.
WHY, SURE.
WHY NOT.
WHAT'S
THE TROUBLE?
APACHE BREED SHOT
ELI SAUNDERS DEAD.
JESUS HELL!
SAUNDERS,
DEAD.
ELIAS, GET SOME FOOD
ON THAT STOVE.
EARL, HELP
WITH THEM HORSES.
YOU LOSE HIM,
QUINCEY?
YEAH.
AW, THAT'S
HELL'S DOING.
YOU FIGURE ON
PUSHING IT ON
AT FIRST LIGHT?
WELL, HE
HEADED SOUTH.
I DON'T HOLD OUT
MUCH HOPE.
JESUS,
WHAT IS THAT?
POTATO
WHISKEY.
HA HA HA.
I'D RATHER
BE BELLY-SHOT.
YOU GET
THE FIRST
SWALLOW DOWN,
THE REST
TASTES GOOD.
EARL'S RIGHT,
HARVE.
IT TAKES GETTING
USED TO,
LIKE DYING.
HA HA HA.
AFTER YOUR
FIRST CUP, HARVE,
YOU'RE BLIND
ANYWAY,
AND AFTER
YOUR SECOND,
YOU'RE DARN GLAD
YOU'RE BLIND.
WELL, IF WE
CATCH THIS BREED,
WE WON'T
HAVE TO HANG HIM.
WE'LL JUST GIVE HIM
A JUG OF THIS.
HEY, YOU'RE
A CRUEL ONE, HARVE.
WHERE'S JUBAL?
HE'LL BE
OUT BACK
SETTING
SOME TRAPS.
YOU BEST TAKE
YOUR SPENCER,
CAPTAIN
QUINCEY.
THE
EVERETTES
HAD SOME
STOCK RUN OFF
BY SOME MIMBRENOS.
YOU NEVER
KNOW.
SHH.
IT'S ME, JUBAL.
I MEAN TO BE
NO TROUBLE, JUBAL.
YOUR COMPANY'S
WELCOME.
BEEN THINKING
ON TOMORROW.
BE OBLIGED
TO HEAR.
CIRCLE AROUND
BY THE EVERETTES',
PICK
THEM UP.
THEN GO ON TO
THE MALECHIE PLACE.
HE'S GOT
THEN OVER TO
EZRA MEADE'S.
HE HAS AN OLD
TIGUA INDIAN
THAT CAN TRACK.
WE MIGHT CUT HIS TRAIL
BEFORE HE GETS TOO FAR
OVER THE LINE.
WELL...
MIGHT BE NO MORE THAN
CATCHING THE WIND.
WE'LL GET HIM.
QUINCEY,
ME AND
MY BROTHERS
WILL GO PAST
THE EDGE OF HELL,
BUT WE'LL HAVE
THAT BREED
AND WE'LL
BURN HIM!
WE'LL BURN HIM!
ME AND ELI,
WE WALKED
THE WHOLE WAR
TOGETHER.
THAT PUTS A MAN
CLOSE TO YOU.
WE'LL SURELY
HAVE THAT BREED
AND BURN HIM.
HOW LONG YOU FIGURE
IT'LL TAKE, QUINCEY?
WELL,
AT THE MOST.
ME AND MY BOYS
ARE ALONE HERE NOW.
MIMBRENOS RUN OFF 3
OF MY BEST BEEF LAST WEEK.
I CAN'T BE GONE LONG.
I HEARD.
I'D UNDERSTAND, JOSH,
IF YOU WANTED NOT TO JOIN--
NO, NO, NO. I'M GONNA
RIDE WITH YOU. GIBBON?
NAW, I'LL RIDE
ANYPLACE TO SEE
A DEAD INJUN.
THIS COULD BE
A GOOD LAND
WITHOUT
THE INJUNS.
COMANCHES
IN TEXAS FIRST,
NOW
THE APACHES HERE...
KILLING, ROBBING.
NAW, I'M GONNA
RIDE WITH YOU,
BUT I JUST
CAN'T BE
GONE LONG.
GIBBON,
YOU STAY CLOSE.
YOU MIND YOUR MA.
GIDDYAP.
GIDDYAP.
HYAH.
HAH! YAH!
GAVIN!
GOOD MORNING,
MRS. MALECHIE.
GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING,
MR. EVERETTE,
GENTLEMEN.
I BELIEVE
YOU KNOW, UH,
QUINCEY
WHITMORE
AND THE
HOOKER BROTHERS
AND, UH,
NYE BUELL.
HOW DO?
NYE.
MARTIN HALL
AND HARVEY
LANSING.
MORNING, MA'AM.
MA'AM.
HELL, I'VE KNOWN HIM
SINCE HE CAME HERE.
MORNING, GAVIN.
GEORGE DUNN FROM
UP WOLF BUTTE WAY.
WILL COOP.
SET YOU DOWN,
GENTLEMEN.
COME ON INSIDE
WITH YOU NOW.
WE'RE NOT HERE
TO BE SOCIABLE,
MALECHIE.
SOME BREED
KILLED ELI
SAUNDERS.
WE'RE
HUNTIN' HIM.
THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT LIKE
TO RIDE WITH US.
YES, I HEARD
ABOUT IT
YESTERDAY.
ONE OF
MY VAQUEROS,
HE KNEW
THIS HALF-BREED
CALLED
PARDON CHATO.
HE BOUGHT SOME HORSES
OFF HIM A YEAR BACK.
DOES THE MEXICAN
KNOW IF THE BREED
HAS A PIECE
OF GROUND TO RUN TO?
I'LL ASK.
HE'S WITH
MY BROTHER-IN-LAW BRADY
BRINGING IN
SOME STRAYS.
I'LL SEND FOR THEM.
YOU BE COMING WITH US,
MR. MALECHIE?
SOON AS I WASH UP.
WILL YOU HAVE
COFFEE AND BISCUITS?
THAT'S TO MY TASTE.
WE'LL RIDE
TO EZRA MEADE'S.
GET HIM AND HIS INDIAN
AND MEET UP AT THE WELLS.
AW, JUBAL, I
HAD A HANKERING
FOR BISCUITS
AND COFFEE.
YOU'LL DO
AS I SAY.
JUST KEEP
MOVING.
YOU SEE THAT
BRADY LOGAN WOMAN?
THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A FINE-LOOKING WOMAN.
PUT IT
FROM YOUR MIND.
THINKING
AIN'T SINNING.
JUBAL, DON'T YOU
EVER GET BOTHERED?
I SWEAR,
BROTHER EARL,
ONE OF THESE DAYS
YOU'RE GONNA
GET CAUGHT
HALFWAY UP
SOMEBODY ELSE'S
PEACH TREE,
AND YOU'RE
GONNA BE DEAD.
BRADY LOGAN
AND THE MEXICAN.
I'M TAKING RAOUL.
DO YOU HAVE
TO GO, GAVIN?
YOU KNOW
I HAVE TO.
I HATE IT
WHEN YOU'RE GONE.
YOU AND MOIRA
WON'T BE ALONE.
I'M LEAVING
THE MEXICANS.
THAT'S NOT
THE SAME.
AND WHAT WOULD
THEY THINK OF US,
NEIGHBORS
AND ALL?
WE'RE NEW
HERE, EDNA.
WE'RE CARVING OUT
A PLACE HERE.
WE'VE GOTTA DO
WHAT'S EXPECTED
OF US.
TO HUNT DOWN
SOME POOR MAN?
HE KILLED
THE SHERIFF.
AND HE'S INDIAN.
IS YOUR PA
AROUND, JACOB?
I'M AROUND.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO ASK
TO STEP DOWN, JUBAL?
WE HAVEN'T
GIVEN YOU
ANY CALL TO SPEAK
HARSH WORDS, EZRA.
SAY YOUR PIECE.
ELI SAUNDERS
WAS MURDERED
BY A 'PACHE BREED.
THE WORLD
WON'T GRIEVE.
QUINCEY WHITMORE
HAS GOT UP A POSSE.
WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO RIDE WITH US, EZRA,
OR LEASTWAYS, LEND US
YOUR INJUN TO TRACK.
I WON'T RIDE
WITH YOUR KIND.
AS FOR THE INJUN,
HE'S HIS OWN MAN.
HE SAYS THE APACHE'S
NOT HIS ENEMY.
NOW, AIN'T
THAT PRETTY?
WE AIN'T GONNA LET
NO DAMN INJUN--
SHUT
YOUR MOUTH.
HE WAS
A WHITE MAN,
EZRA.
HE WAS A REDNECK
WITH A LOUD MOUTH
AND A GUN.
I HEARD HE
GOT NO MORE
THAN HE
CALLED FOR.
SON,
YOU WANNA
SWALLOW BACK
THEM WORDS?
RIDE OUT.
WE'RE WAITING
FOR AN APOLOGY, EZRA.
YOU'LL NOT
GET ONE HERE.
DON'T GIVE ME
THE PLEASURE.
HYAH!
WHERE'S MEADE?
HE WON'T
RIDE WITH US.
HE FAVORS
THE BREED.
EZRA ALWAYS WAS
A MITE STAND-OFF.
IT'LL NOT
BE FORGOTTEN.
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
OF MEADE
AS A GOOD
NEIGHBOR.
WHO'S THE MEX?
HE RIDES
FOR MALECHIE.
LOOKS MORE THAN
HALF APACHE TO ME.
HE'S PART YAQUI.
YOU BEST KEEP
A SHORT ROPE ON HIM.
WE'LL TURN SOUTH
FROM HERE
AND HEAD TOWARDS
THE HIGH COUNTRY.
KEEP SPREAD OUT
AND HUNT FOR SIGN.
ANYONE SEE ANYTHING,
RAISE A SHOUT
OR SHOOT TWICE.
MALECHIE,
TELL YOUR MEXICAN
TO SCOUT AHEAD
OVER BY
THAT LONG RIDGE.
THAT'S THE LAST PLACE
WE CAUGHT HIS TRAIL.
WHISKEY AND
A HOT SUN DON'T MIX.
WELL, NEITHER
DOES MY ASS
AND THIS
DAMN SADDLE.
ANYHOW,
I USED TO
HEARD IT SAID
YOU BOYS THAT
RODE WITH HOOD
DRANK 5 STATES DRY.
ALWAYS TELL WHERE
HOOD'S TEXANS HAVE BEEN
BY THE EMPTY BOTTLES
AND THE DEAD YANKEES.
AND IT WAS
TRUE.
FROM CEMETERY HILL
TILL OLD SLOW TROT THOMAS
BROKE US AT NASHVILLE,
WE HAD MORE THAN
OUR SHARE OF BOTH.
YOU KNOW,
ONE THING I NEVER
COULD FATHOM, QUINCEY.
HOW DID
THEM YANKEES WIN?
THEY HAD MORE--
MORE MEN, MORE GUNS,
MORE FOOD, MORE LUCK.
YOU KNOW, WHEN
I LOOK BACK AT IT,
I KNOW NOW THAT
IT WAS ALL THERE
FOR THE SEEING,
EXCEPT WE
DIDN'T SEE IT.
GETTING LICKED,
I MEAN, AS EARLY
AS '63.
HOOD TOOK US UP
LITTLE ROUND TOP
AT GETTYSBURG.
AND IF WE
COULD HAVE HELD IT,
WE COULD HAVE ROLLED
BACK THOSE YANKEES
LIKE OLD CARPETS.
BUT THERE WERE
TOO MANY OF THEM.
THEY SAY
FROM CULP'S HILL,
YOU COULD SEE
IT ALL CLEAR.
GRAY LINES COMIN'
LIKE THE SEA WASH,
YELLIN' AND SORT
OF BREAKING UP
WHEN THEY HIT THE BLUE
RIDGE AND THEN...
FALLIN' BACK.
LEE CRIED.
I GUESS HE KNEW.
HELL...
IT WAS A GOOD WAR.
HYAH, HYAH. HEY.
APACHE.
YOU SURE?
HOW LONG AGO? WHEN?
AN HOUR, MAYBE LESS,
HE SAYS.
IT DON'T MAKE SENSE.
HOW CAN YOU
TELL THAT?
FROM THE DROPPINGS.
SUN DRIES THEM
PRETTY DAMN QUICK.
STILL FRESH INSIDE,
MEANS IT
AIN'T BEEN LONG.
LOOKS LIKE HE STAYED
HERE QUITE A SPELL.
DON'T MAKE SENSE,
JUBAL.
SHOULD HAVE BEEN
LONG GONE FROM HERE,
A RUNNING MAN
AND ALL.
MIGHT BE
HE FIGURED
WE STOPPED
CHASING HIM.
CIRCLED AROUND
FOR SOME REASON.
MIGHT BE.
IF HE DOES, WE'LL
HAVE US A HANGIN'
COME NIGHTFALL.
STILL DAMN HOT,
EVEN WITH THOSE CLOUDS.
WELL, MAYBE IT'LL
SWEAT SOME OF THE WHISKEY
OUT OF YOUR HIDE, NYE.
WATCH IT.
WATCH IT!
WHO'S DOWN?
WATCH THE HORSES.
WILL, YOU OKAY?
YOU ALL RIGHT,
QUINCEY?
HE'S HURT.
HOW IS IT, WILL?
IS IT BROKEN?
DON'T KNOW. HOW'S
IT FEEL, WILL?
SORE INSIDE.
I DON'T
THINK IT'S BROKE,
BUT HE CAN'T RIDE.
GEORGE, CAN YOU GET HIM
BACK TO ARILLO?
SURE, CAPTAIN.
WE'LL MAKE
A TRAVOIS FOR HIM.
THERE'S SOME BRUSH
DOWN AT THE BOTTOM THERE.
MY PLACE IS CLOSER.
YOU CAN GET
A WAGON THERE.
WE GOT
OUR WORK CUT OUT.
YOU'RE THE LUCKY
ONE, WILL.
GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT, WILL?
SORRY,
GEORGE.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, WILL.
I GOT A FEELING WE'RE
WELL OUT OF IT ANYWAY.
THE MEXICAN...
PRETTY GOOD...
PRETTY GOOD.
DAMN THIS LIGHT.
MIGHT AS WELL BED DOWN
HERE FOR THE NIGHT,
GET A FRESH START
IN THE MORNING.
UNSADDLE
AND MAKE CAMP.
HELL, THERE'S
NO WATER HERE, QUINCEY.
WE'RE GETTIN' LOW
ON WATER.
AND THE HORSES
WILL NEED SOME.
EARL'S GONE HUNTIN'
FOR WATER.
YOU CAN BET THE
HONEYBEE'S SUGAR TIT
THERE AIN'T NO WATER
TO FIND.
LOOK AROUND--
SHARP ROCK, DRY DIRT,
AND THAT'S ALL.
EACH MAN RATION
HIS OWN WATER.
DAMP DOWN
YOUR NECK CLOTHS
OR SOME PIECE
OF SOMETHING
AND WET DOWN
THE HORSES' MUZZLES.
I'VE EATEN SO MUCH
OF THIS DAMN LAND TODAY,
I CAN'T EVEN SPIT.
YOU'LL EAT
MORE OF IT TOMORROW.
WE HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN
THE SHIRTTAIL OF HIM YET.
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF WHAT WE'RE CHASIN'
IS THE BREED THAT DONE IT.
JUBAL THOUGHT HE'D HAVE
A HANGIN' BY NIGHT.
THE ONLY HANGIN'
IS MY ASS.
QUINCEY!
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?
LET ME SEE THAT.
THERE'S NO USE
STARING AT THEM.
THAT ROTTEN
BASTARD!
YOU FIGURE IT
WAS THE BREED?
WHO'D YOU FIGURE
IT WAS?
HE COULD HAVE
CUT OUR THROATS.
MAYBE HE ISN'T
A KILLING MAN.
HE'S HALF APACHE,
AIN'T HE?
YOU MIX DOG
AND WOLF,
YOU WIND UP WITH
A KILLIN' ANIMAL.
HE KILLED ELI.
THAT'S A FACT.
HE'S EITHER A DAMN FOOL
OR HE GOT SOME GAME.
APACHE DON'T LEAVE TRACKS
UNLESS THEY GOT A REASON.
I DON'T LIKE IT.
I DON'T LIKE IT
ONE BIT.
YOU WANT TO HIGHTAIL
IT FOR HOME,
HARVEY, DO YOU?
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
WE'RE GONNA FIND
THAT BREED...
AND WE'RE GONNA
HANG HIM.
AND NOBODY'S GONNA
DO DIFFERENT.
NOW, HOLD ON NOW,
JUBAL.
THERE'S NO CAUSE
FOR THAT.
EACH MAN IS HERE
BY HIS OWN DOIN'.
IF A MAN WANTS OUT,
HE CAN.
I WOULDN'T RIDE
WITH A MAN
WHO DIDN'T WANT
TO RIDE WITH ME.
WE'RE GONNA
RIDE TILL WE GET HIM.
WHAT ARE YOU ALL THORN
AND THISTLE ABOUT, JUBAL?
HARVE DIDN'T SAY NOTHIN'
ABOUT GOING BACK.
HERE COMES THE MEXICAN.
WHERE IN
HELL'S HE BEEN?
TRACKING.
ONE THING FOR SURE,
THAT BREED
AIN'T FAR AHEAD.
SAYS HE FOUND
FRESH TRACKS
HEADING SOUTH
TOWARDS THE LAVA HILLS.
THAT'S, UH...BAD
COUNTRY, QUINCEY.
THIS AIN'T HARDLY
THE GARDEN OF EDEN.
LISTEN, QUINCEY,
YOU KNOW,
COULD BE THAT BREED
IS LEADIN'
AND WE'RE FOLLOWIN'.
AND IF IT'S TRUE,
HE COULD BE LEADIN' US
INTO BAD APACHE TROUBLE.
THEM MIMBRENOS THAT RUN OFF
MY BEEF A WHILE BACK,
THEY COULD HIDING
UP IN THE HILLS.
MIND YA, I'M JUST
SAYIN' MAYBE.
MAYBE.
WELL, WHAT
DO YOU THINK?
WELL, I LEARNED ONE
THING WHEN I WAS WITH...
TOM JEFFORDS
CHASING COCHISE.
YOU CAN NEVER KNOW
WHAT'S IN
AN APACHE'S MIND.
AIN'T A MAN LIKE...
LIKE WE KNOW A MAN.
HE THINKS APACHE,
AND THAT'S A...
A SHUT BOOK FULL OF...
TERRIBLE THINGS.
I GOT A REAL DISLIKE
OF RED BEANS.
GONNA BE
A HOT ONE.
NO, MAYBE SNOW
BY NOON, ELIAS.
HA HA. AND THE DEVIL
TAKE A CHILL, HUH?
YOU SURE AS HELL
ALL SPEED.
BREAKFAST
DONE.
YOU INDIAN DIRT.
NOW, YOU KEEP ALL
YOUR KILLIN' FEELINGS
FOR WHAT
WE GOTTA DO.
I TELL YOU,
BROTHER EARL,
YOU GOT SOME KIND
OF SWEET DISPOSITION,
ALL SUN AND
LITTLE WHITE FLOWERS.
PLEASANT COMPANY,
THEM HOOKER BOYS.
NOTHIN' MOVIN'.
THAT DON'T MEAN
A DAMN THING.
WATCH THAT BROKEN
GROUND OVER THERE.
I'M GOING
TO HAVE A LOOK.
NOBODY ABOUT FOR
QUITE A SPELL, I'D SAY.
HYAH!
MESCALERO.
AIN'T NOTHIN'
HERE.
HEY, LOOK. THEY HAD
THEMSELVES A FEAST.
WHAT IS IT?
DOG.
APACHES
THINK ON DOG
LIKE YOU THINK ON
A GOOD STEAK, BRADY.
HE'D RATHER EAT DOG
THAN BEEF.
IF HE WAS HUNGRY,
HE'D EAT
HIS OWN DUNG.
WELL, NO MORE
THAN ANY OTHER MAN,
AND LESS THAN MOST.
THEY AREN'T MEN.
THEY'RE ANIMALS.
YEAH, GOD KNOWS
WHAT GOD WAS THINKING
WHEN HE MADE
THE APACHE.
WE'LL BURN
THEM WICKIUPS
AND THEN WE'LL RIDE.
HYAH!
COME ON,
LET'S GET THIS ONE!
HA HA HA!
WE CAN'T RIDE
ACROSS THESE FLATS.
WE'LL TEAR THE HEARTS
OUT OF THE HORSES.
MALECHIE'S
RIGHT, JUBAL.
THE BREED WILL
RIDE ACROSS.
IF HE DOES, HE'LL BE
ON FOOT BEFORE NIGHT.
HOW MANY MILES ACROSS
DO YOU FIGURE, BUELL?
ENOUGH.
WHEN WE GET
THIS DAMN INDIAN,
I'M SURE GONNA MAKE
HIS DYIN' SLOW.
PUT GOD'S WORD
ON THAT.
HIM AND
HIS DAMN LAND.
HEY, MAYBE HE'S GOT
A WOMAN OUT THERE...
SOMEPLACE.
JEEZ, EARL,
DON'T YOU EVER
THINK ABOUT
NOTHIN' ELSE?
DON'T LET
THE HORSES BREAK.
WHOA. WHOA.
COME HERE,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.
WHOA.
WHOA.
EASY, EASY.
WHOA, HO, HO, HO.
I DON'T SEE
A THING.
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK.
MARTIN, YOU
ALL IN ONE PIECE?
YEAH.
MEXICAN ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, I SEEN
HIM MOVE.
THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY, JUBAL.
LET'S GET AT IT.
NYE, ELIAS,
JUBAL, AND ME
ARE GOING IN
AFTER HIM.
THE REST OF YOU,
SPREAD OUT
AND GIVE US COVER.
MARTIN, YOU STAY
WITH THE HORSES.
AAH!
WE'VE BEEN
SUCKERED, QUINCEY.
THAT'S A
GOD-GIVEN FACT.
HE SAID IT'S THE BREED
THEY CALL CHATO, ALL RIGHT.
HE CAN TELL
BY THE HORSE HE RIDES.
WELL, I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.
WE GOTTA FIND
THOSE HORSES
BEFORE NIGHT.
WHOA.
WHOA. WHOA.
YOU FLY-TAILED
BASTARD!
WHOA, RED.
WHOA.
WHOA.
I SWEAR, I'M GONNA
STRETCH YOUR HIDE
AND LEAVE THE REST
FOR THE CROWS.
HOT AND READY.
I'LL BET THAT HORSE
TASTES BETTER
THAN HE RODE.
NYE,
YOU GOT YOUR OWN
MOTHER IN A SKILLET
BEFORE
SHE GOT COLD.
HE NEVER
MET THE LADY.
WHERE YOU FROM,
BRADY?
BEFORE YOU CAME OUT
TO THE TERRITORY.
A PLACE
CALLED GREENOCK
ON THE WEST COAST
OF SCOTLAND.
I USED TO WORK
IN LITHGOW'S YARDS,
SHIPWRIGHT.
YOU EVER
LONG FOR IT?
YEAH.
YEAH, WATER AND FIRE
DIFFERENT,
THIS LAND
AND THERE.
THERE, THE RIVER,
THE SEA FOG,
GRAY STONE HOUSES
WET IN THE RAIN.
WE USED TO STAND
BEHIND THE TOWN
AND LOOK DOWN
OVER THE SLATE ROOFS
ACROSS THE RIVER
TO THE HIGHLANDS
ON THE OTHER SIDE.
YEAH.
I NEVER DID GET
TO LOOK AT THE SEA.
BROTHER JUBAL
DID ONCE.
SAID IT WAS SO BIG THE
MIND COULDN'T HOLD IT.
HOT AND RARE!
YOU FROM GEORGIA,
TOO, QUINCEY?
TEXAS.
BETTER DRAG
THEM HORSES OFF.
THEY'LL CALL ALL
THE FLIES IN BY MORNING.
EARL?
HOW ARE WE
WITH WATER?
GETTIN' SHORT.
AND WE'RE
YOU'RE--
YOU'RE GOING ON
AFTER HIM, QUINCEY?
WELL...
WHEN THE BREED
HIT US,
HE HAD A MIND
TO TURN US BACK.
AN INJUN WILL
CHASE SOMETHING
UNTIL THE CHASIN'
COSTS TOO MUCH
AND THEN
HE'LL DROP IT.
THAT'S HOW
HE THINKS.
NOW, HE DON'T PLAN
ON SOMETHING
COMIN' AFTER HIM
NO MATTER WHAT.
HE MIGHT JUST GET
CARELESS NOW.
I'M AGREED.
I SAY NO MORE
THAN A WEEK FOR IT.
YOU CAN'T PUT
A HALTER ON IT.
I CAN FOR MYSELF.
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE OTHERS,
HARVE AND JOSH?
THEY GET THEIR SAY?
ANYBODY WANT
TO BACK DOWN,
THEY GO ON FOOT,
LEAVE THEIR WATER FOR
THEM THAT STAY WITH IT.
JUBAL, YOU GOT MORE
GENEROSITY THAN JUNE.
THAT'S A GEORGIA CHOICE.
I MUST SAY, IT'LL
CUT SHORT THINKING ON.
HA HA HA.
NYE, WHAT IN THE HELL
ARE WE DOIN' OUT HERE?
WE'VE GOT
INDIAN FEVER.
SWEATS IN A MAN, DRIVES
HIM BLIND IN THE EYE
AND NOT QUITE RIGHT
IN THE HEAD.
WE AIN'T SEEN SCRATCH
NOR HAIR OF THAT BREED
SINCE HE
BUFFALOED US.
I AIN'T SURE
I WANT TO.
I GOT A BAD FEELIN'
COMIN' OVER ME, NYE.
I'LL BET THE MEX
GOT WATER.
GOT WATER,
MEX?
YOU'RE HOLDIN'
OUT ON US.
EARL.
I DON'T TRUST HIM.
HE GOT TOO MUCH
INDIAN IN HIM.
HE AIN'T TRYIN'
TO FIND THE BREED.
HE'S BREED HIMSELF.
HE'S TRYIN' TO LOSE
US, I'M TELLIN' YA.
YOU STAND BY
YOUR MAN, MALECHIE?
HE'S A GOOD MAN.
YAQUI-MEX
IS MORE THAN
HALFWAY APACHE.
YEAH, WHY SHOULD
HE HELP US?
YOU GOT
MALECHIE'S WORD.
YOU GOT A SICKNESS
ON YOU, EARL.
CAN'T BIDE
ANYTHING INJUN.
DO YOU TRUST HIM,
CAPTAIN?
WELL, WE USED
APACHE SCOUTS
WHEN WE WENT
AFTER COCHISE.
THEY NEVER
BROKE FAITH.
APACHE DON'T GIVE
HIS WORD EASY,
BUT GIVEN, I'VE NEVER
KNOWN ONE TO BREAK IT.
I GUESS IT'S SAME
WITH THE YAQUIS.
I'M GOING TO KILL
YOU, MEX.
UNDERSTAND?
AND THAT'S
A PROMISE.
YOU MEAN FACE ON...
OR WHEN HE GIVES YOU
HIS BACK?
YOU'RE GONNA PUT
FOOT ON MY PATCH
ONCE TOO OFTEN,
MALECHIE.
YOU DON'T
FRIGHTEN ME, SONNY.
EARL, PUT
THE GUN DOWN.
YOU HEAR ME?
PUT IT DOWN.
HE GOT HIS HEELS
INTO ME, I SWEAR.
PUT THE GUN
AWAY NOW.
RIGHT NOW.
OOH.
UGH.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU MADE YOUR POINT.
TAKE IT EASY.
HEY, YOU SURE
ARE ONE HELL
OF A FIGHTER,
BROTHER.
BIG PARTY,
WENT BY TODAY
OR DAY BEFORE.
MOST LIKELY
A RAIDIN' PARTY.
OR A MURDERING
PARTY.
WE LEFT OUR WOMEN,
OUR PLACES.
THEY COULD BE
HEADING THAT WAY.
SOME OF THESE HORSES
ARE SHOD AND UNRODE.
IT MEANS THEY'VE--
THEY'VE RAIDED AND
ARE ON THEIR WAY HOME.
HEADIN' NORTH?
WELL, COULD
BE COMANCHE.
COMANCHES?
COMANCHES AIN'T
THIS FAR SOUTH.
KIOWA RAID
INTO MEXICO.
THEY'VE BEEN AS FAR
SOUTH AS YUCATAN.
COULD BE APACHES
JUST AS EASY, QUINCE.
AN INJUN DON'T RAID
WITH SO MANY EXTRA MOUNTS.
THEY'VE BEEN AND
GOT WHAT THEY WANT.
I AGREE WITH JUBAL.
COMANCHE.
MAYBE A FEW KIOWA.
WELL, THAT DON'T
EASE THE MIND NONE.
WE MIGHT
RUN INTO THEM.
THAT COULD BE
REAL BAD.
IF THEY CAUGHT US
IN THIS OPEN GROUND...
ME AND
THE MEX
WILL SCOUT AHEAD,
QUINCEY.
I DO
BELIEVE YOU--
YOU REALLY ENJOYING
THIS, QUINCEY.
NOW,
THE HOOKERS,
THEY HATE BETTER
THAN MOST.
THAT PUSHES THEM.
THE OTHERS?
HA HA HA.
THEY HAD
SMALL CHOICE.
BUT YOU,
QUINCEY...
WITH YOU, IT AIN'T
SO EASY TO READ.
YOU GOT A...
HUNGERING.
FOR A THIRSTY MAN
IN A DRY LAND,
YOU GOT A LOT
OF TALK, NYE.
YOU KNOW,
SOME MEN JUST
CAN'T LET GO OF TIME.
PASSES
THEM BY,
REACH OUT AND
GRAB HER SHIRTTAILS.
HA HA.
THAT'S YOU, QUINCEY.
YOU CAN'T BE JUST
ANOTHER FACE
AROUND A SMALL TOWN.
MM-MM.
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE DOING,
ALL WRAPPED
IN GRAY,
SITTING PROUD
ON THAT HORSE,
CHASIN' ONE DAMN
HALF-BREED
AND THINKIN' ABOUT
THAT BASTARD GRANT
AND HIS YANKEES.
ENJOY IT, BOYS.
IT'S THE END OF THE WATER.
WE'LL FIND WATER
IN THE MORNING.
WHY DON'T WE JUST
COME OUT WITH IT?
THE BREED'S LOST US.
W-W-WE AIN'T SEEN
NONE OF HIS SIGN.
WHAT IS IT
YOU'RE SAYING, JOSH?
I'M SAYING THAT WE'RE
CHASING A BAD GUESS,
ONLY.
WE RUN OUT OF WATER.
AND WE GOT NOTHIN'
LEFT TO EAT
EXCEPT SOME RED BEANS
AND SOME SCRAWNY
PRAIRIE CHICKENS.
AND YOU'VE GOT AN ITCH
TO GET BACK TO WHERE
THERE'S GOOD FOOD
AND A FAT WIFE.
I GOT A SPREAD BACK THERE
THAT NEEDS WORKING.
ALL WE GOT OUT HERE
IS A HANDFUL OF NOTHIN'.
DIRT AND DRY MOUTHS.
JOSH IS RIGHT.
LIKE HELL HE IS.
YOU'VE GOT THE QUITTIN'
STREAK, TOO?
DON'T LEAN TOO HEAVY
ON ME, JUBAL.
I DON'T BEND EASY.
HOW DO YOU SEE IT,
QUINCEY?
AS JOSH SAYS,
WE MIGHT BE GUESSING,
BUT I GOT A FEELING
WE'RE NOT.
THAT BREED TRIED
TO LEAD US OFF
AND THEN LOSE US.
HE DIDN'T HEAD
FOR MEXICO,
AND HE COULD'VE
AND MADE IT, EASY.
INSTEAD HE--HE HEADED
INTO BAD COUNTRY
AND THEN SWUNG NORTH.
NOW, PUT THAT
WITH THE FACT
THAT HE BOUGHT
SUPPLIES IN TOWN,
AND I THINK THAT POINTS
TO HIM HAVING SOMEPLACE
HE WANTS KEPT SAFE.
UHH.
HEH HEH.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, JOSH?
JUST A COYOTE.
JOSH SEES THAT
AS BAD MEDICINE.
HA HA HA!
YOU GETTIN' INDIAN
ON US, JOSH?
HEH HEH HEH.
COME ON.
EASE UP, JOSH.
I'M GONNA KILL
THAT DOG.
HA HA HA!
HA HA!
YOU WOULDN'T THINK
A GROWN MAN
WOULD WORRY
ABOUT A DOG.
OH!
WHAT'S TROUBLING
YOU, JOSH?
OH, QUINCEY,
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST THAT THINGS
AREN'T WORKING OUT
THE WAY I FIGURED
THEY WOULD.
SAY, DON'T YOU EVER
HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS?
YOU KNOW, ARE YOU
STILL AS SURE ABOUT
WHAT WE'RE DOIN'
AS WHEN WE STARTED?
I TELL YOU, QUINCEY,
I AIN'T A BELIEVIN' MAN,
BUT I GOT A GOD-FEAR.
I THINK HE'S GONNA
LAY HIS HAND ON US.
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH.
WHOOOO!
YUHOO! WHOO!
YIP! YIP!
WHOHOO-WEE!
HEY-YAH!
GIVE ME MY HAT.
GET ALL THE WATER
OUT OF MY HAT.
COME ON, GET IT.
DON'T FILL YOUR
BELLIES TOO FAST.
HA! STOP THAT.
YOU SEE ANY SIGN?
WELL, THAT RAIDING PARTY
TURNED TO THE NORTHEAST
A COUPLE MILES BACK.
NOTHING SINCE.
HA HA HA!
THEN THEY MUST
BE COMANCHES.
I HOPE WE DON'T
STEP ON THEIR TAILS.
BETTER 10 COMANCHE
THAN ONE 'PACHE
THAT'S JUST LIKE SAYING,
"BETTER POX THAN THE PLAGUE."
I SEEN COMANCHES
IN TEXAS,
AND, BOY, I NEVER WANNA SEE
ONE AGAIN, I CAN TELL YOU.
WELL, YOU DON'T
SEE APACHE.
YOU DON'T HEAR 'EM
AND YOU DON'T SEE 'EM.
IT'S LIKE
AN ACT OF GOD.
OH, YOU ARE A COMFORT,
CAPTAIN QUINCEY.
HEY!
HEY!
CUT THAT OUT!
AH!
