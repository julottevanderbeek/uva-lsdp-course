" Full Faith and Credit "
Doc
How you feelin'?
Sleepy…
As a man fuckin' should at this hour,
if you don't mind me sayin'
It's this hour I'm able to see to ya
I understand
and I'm grateful
At least half that
fuckin' statement's a fuckin' lie
Take it easy, Doc
Try and get dressed today
Cheyenne and Black Hills Telegraph Company
What the fuck is that to me?
Telegram for Jane Cannary
Oh, yeah?
Well, here's a pistol for whatever your spidery fuckin' name is
Please, do not kill me
I'm only messenger
Shut the fuck up and read the message!
How'd Al answer?
He didn't answer at all
Good for him
Mornin'
Mornin'
Mornin'.
Best time of day to go fuck yourself
"From Samuel Fields
to Miss Jane Cannary."
I don't know any Samuel Fields
Valediction is "Nigger General."
Gimme that fuckin' thing,
and keep the fuckin' contents to yourself!
Trust,
Gentlemen and Ladies,
we live in faith!
John Langrishe, Madam,
wishing you good morning on an august occasion
Morning
Hoping to walk with you a bit. Better to represent my intentions this day than the last
All right
May I ask your name?
Joanie Stubbs
I regret having abrupted upon you, Miss Stubbs as you gardened
I took you for interested in something you mightn't have been
My interest,
to be direct,
is in buying your building
What do you want to use it for?
A theater
My troupe will season in this camp
Well, it's a schoolhouse now
And very handsomely appointed for that purpose
It was a whorehouse before
Anyways, I don't know if I'd want to sell
Well, perhaps you'd consider renting
Perhaps you'd consider fucking yourself
If I was approaching you backwards, Captain,
had a mirror to observe your activity,
just now I'd be most trepidatious,
for, Johnny,
this is a man when acting from behind and advantaged with a weapon,
very much to be feared
Was just doing my job
You don't want to speak like that again to Mr. Hearst
Yeah, I do
Do you wanna try to change my fuckin' mind?
Not only will I change your mind,
I'll rip your whole fucking head off
Another fuckin' invite
Fuckin' Hearst must take me for an optimist
I'm gonna kill that cocksucker
All in good time
I'm curious about those tables with the numbers on them
Well, they're for gambling on, those
Various kinds of games of chance or
different sorts
So I imagined
I wonder
if this might be convenient time for me to learn?
Leon, uh,
take over supervising for me while I
give this young lady some private instruction
Yes, sir
Supervising now, Sir
This over here is a choice table
Horatio, beat it
Am  I inconveniencing you?
Oh
damn Chinks
They shrunk these pants in the laundry
You ever throw the bones before, Ma'am?
I've caught some
Oh
these are my personal dice
Nice, uh,
fuckin' set
I'm happy and glad to
allow you to learn on 'em
Damn chinks
I should cut your salary 20%!
Uh
Based on time you're absent campaigning
Can I make up the hours once I'm beat?
Your plans are idiotic
You're running for Sheriff
to be a fireman
And hope to be a second deputy
in case they start a fire department
Well, that's stupid and I ought to cut your salary
You have to, you have to
Why not build a fuckin' fire wagon
that you then rent out to the camp?
If I had money
If you had a loan
for the wagon's makings
and help with the fuckin' carpentry,
would you build the wagon then?
Uh,
I'd  repay you at fuckin' interest, boss
Well, that's the 20%,
pre-deducted from the makings' purchase
We build the fuckin' wagon
then rent it to the camp
And don't ever speak of this again
A-a-a-and two fuckin' fire hats
Nigger General ain't quit drinkin', we know that for fuckin' sure
How do we know that?
What you just read to me is a drunkard's question
"What is state of affairs in camp with regards to the horse?"
Seems to me whatever the state of affairs about the horse is in the camp,
It's a drunkard's decision bringin' the cocksucker back
That's on Hostetler, according to the little Nigger General,
if you'd understand what you fuckin' read
Hostetler means to bring the horse back
Hostetler!
"You're right, Jane
I'm a fuckin' moron as usual
What I should be doin', being as you have no experience,
s helping you compose a telegraph back to little Nigger General as requested."
Come over here and save yourself
the cost of a wire
Oh, fuck!
What are you lookin' at, huh?
think just 'cause I happen to got a peppermint,
it's yours by right?
Always possible I'm having a nightmare
You greedy, sweet-toothed cocksucker
That's right
that's right
You come to take my place away!
Oh, Miss Stubbs
Take a seat in that cell there till I
square a place away for you
I have an offer to sell my place
How are you inclined to answer?
Unless you don't yet know,
if I ain't out of place askin'
I told the man to fuck himself
Tactics or a
true position?
I don't know
I don't know, Mr. Utter
Why don't I close up for a while?
Oh, please don't
Nigger General and Hostetler brung that
horse back to camp, got away from 'em and trampled
the Sheriff's boy
Is that so?
Wherever the two of them was,
I guess they didn't feel their lives were in enough danger
Well, people will do strange things
For years at a time
Pick any part of my life, for example
It just don't sit well with me
To sell your place, you mean?
But I can't think why I wouldn't
What's wrong with whim for a reason?
I'll tell you what I like
What I like is knowing these children are learning
I like that, and I like watering their garden
the days they ain't in session
The day that school opened,
I remember sayin' to Sheriff Bullock
what a nice thing it seemed,
watching them little ones walk off to your place
That's what I Goddamn like,
imagining them walkin' into it
I ain't seen it yet, but
I'd like to,
and when he
wanted to buy it, all I thought's
"Now I never will."
Oh God Almighty
What  is it, Miss Stubbs?
I wish once I
could…
care for those little ones
Just once instead
of doin' what I did
Walked in like the past six weeks never fuckin' happened
Never fuckin' left the camp
Never  fuckin' abandoned the fuckin' horses to starve,
or die of fuckin' thirst
Nigger motherfuckers!
Harry,
what the fuck are you waitin' for?!
What are you talking about, Steve
What I swore up and down was gonna happen,
and nobody paid me any heed
What happened to me in Utica
and every other fuckin' place I've ever been in my fuckin' life!
The white man bears the nigger's weight
around his neck like a fucking albatross
And yet people still ask,
"Well, why is he bent over?!
And why can he barely fuckin' walk?!"
The livery's gone
All my labor,
efforts are gone
for naught
And they walked in
like they never fucking left,
and they didn't take responsibility
for trampling that white boy!
Nor did they give less
than a flyin' fuck!
And I wonder what the fuckin' parents are gonna say about that too!
Why don't you stand down over there, Harry?
Many thanks
If you stay in camp long, Sir,
you may have the delightful surprise of meeting your identical twin
He has appointed to degrade himself
The open question is with whom
Now we'll find out about you
What is it?
Or justice for the white man or for your own dead child
At the Saloon Number fucking 10!
Well, are you coming?
Yeah, I'm fucking coming
Mrs. Ellsworth
You don't confuse me with Mrs. Bullock?
Well, as far as the conjugal enterprise,
I'll admit often feeling like a schoolboy
Thank you for it
Speaking further, 'twixt your mine and now this bank,
however much I mayn't be good at it,
I feel I married rather well
I put you on notice
Want my money,
it better be fucking available,
day or fucking night
Mayn't I draw you a map then in case it's night you want it,
to lead you to where I live
so you can wake me?
Now fuck you then
I ain't depositing
Oh no?
Oh, say it ain't fuckin' so, you stupid fucking asshole!
Now  now now now
Now now, fucking what?!
Now now, keep your voice down
Who the fuck are you anyway?
Sir...
Stay out of this
Deposits here, if we fucking let you make 'em,
are backed by this lady's gold mine
So do not confuse her with some paper palace fly-by-night who means "catch me if you can,
turn me upside down and whatever falls out of my pants pocket is what's behind my scrip,"
when his note says "Full faith and credit."
Thank you, Mr. Ellsworth
She'd make the uses of money available for people in the camp ain't belligerent cocksuckers
Short of following you around with her fucking mine on her back,
how else is she supposed to do it?
Thank you
You're welcome
I am Mrs. Ellsworth
Ah
How do you do?
I guess I'll try you out
Our hearts fucking leap with joy
Keep him here
Now we'll see if he takes the nigger's word or how they fucking lie
Shut up!
Well, give me a drink and it's a deal, Tom
Go on away from here now
Ain't nobody trying to keep you
Yeah, that's why I come back with you, Hostetler,
to worsen my chances when I try to flee
I was coming to find you once I had the horse cleaned
This is the horse that hurt your boy
We collected him and we brung him back
He died
The horse escaped in my care,
you may hold the boy's dying against me
Hostetler took precautions
We was trying to nut the horse
shut up now
shut up
I collected the horse and brought him back
I'm back too
You say what you think is right
I'm not gonna act against you
for an accident
Your boy…
I'm as sorry as I can be
I hope you will take that to his mother for me
I'm here to talk about the livery
I feel sorry running away from this too
It's a shame leaving animals uncared for
Wanting not to be killed
will put you to some difficult choices
Steve's been looking after the place
Did damn good at first look
Any chance to keep hell from breaking loose between you?
He left out of here shouting and screaming
off of me saying thanks for looking out
I'm asking, Hostetler,
far as you go,
does hell have to break loose?
No,
hell don't have to break loose
A colleague of mine, Leon,
out of the Bella Union
you might not have noticed him
Leon remarks to me after you left,
"That young lady had a front porch on her a fella could read a book off of."
You know Leon said that unsolicited
It's time to go
In a few days,
we can do this again
Uh, Captain will be back at the helm!
Mr. Langrishe,
I couldn't possibly
consider your offer
unless
you would agree
to  building a new schoolhouse
at your expense
for Mrs. Bullock and the children
Well, who could say no to that?
Well, what
what if Mrs. Bullock doesn't want a change of location?
I can't think why she'd prefer teaching in an ex-brothel over
a place new-built for schooling
People are strange about things, Charlie
But if you like, I'll
get her say-so
And then I'll speak to Mr. Langrishe
Why don't' we talk at the hardware store?
Why don't we talk right here?
A 30-minute recess boys
No recess on my account
I don't want my getting' fucked to put others to inconvenience
No one's here to fuck you, Steve,
if you'd just quit running your mouth
First off,
I thank you for looking to the livery
He'll talk to me through you or he won't get any fucking response
I'm grateful for the care you gave the animals
Now you wait
until he translates from ape
Don't insult him again
You being this kind of neutral Sheriff
is why I'm gonna vote for Harry Manning
I want to pay you for your time and your trouble
That's it?
Send me on my fucking way?
And if you wanted to work there,
I would be willing to keep you on
Look at him, gritting his teeth,
holding onto his fucking nose!
Don't you do me any fucking favors, Hostetler!
I didn't ask permission of anyone to look after that stock,
and I'm not gonna start with a fucking nigger!
The Sheriff will have your back pay
if you come to change your mind
Fuck you!
I was answerable to that horse that trampled his boy
Camp being stirred up,
if I lingered to make my arrangements I don't' think I would have lived to catch that horse
Ain't that the purest form or nigger logic?
He runs,
he blames the white man,
and then he comes back
and he treats him like dirt!
Hey, when can I start working for you,
you fucking monkey ape?!
Why don't you start jumping up and down and
pounding your chest
and murder a few dozen lice?!
You motherfucker
What did you say about my mother?!
You motherfuckers
What did you just say about these people!
You ofay motherfuckers!
Put me down until you're ready to kill me or run
You're gonna leave this to me
Do you understand?
You leave it to me
I came my part and he wouldn't meet me
I'll take care of it
Will you let me try?
It's what I want for my son
Put me down now
If I do,
it won't be to kill you and I'm not running
So what are we gonna do then?
Put me down
I was gonna go to Oregon
You let him buy me out fair and I'll fucking go
I'll be at the livery
He'll sell to you
Do you want to take it on?
I don't have the means to purchase it
If you had the means at loan
Yes, I'd be willing, very much so
No bargain
My partner would make the price
You'd say yes or no
Yeah, I'm interested, if I had the means at loan
What do you think of that?
Sheriff Bullock
Trying to broker some settlement between Steve and Hostetler
Well I'll find you later then
Be quick, you got me now
Must've been unwelcome to Mrs. Bullock,
that horse being brought back
Not wantin' to intrude on her,
Miss Stubbs was having asked me to find out,
might I ask you to speak in her stead
as to something I believe
we both know where she stand on?
Is that your Goddamn idea of quick, Charlie?
Miss Stubbs,
that owns the Chez Ami building
where Mrs. Bullock teaches,
has got asked to name a price
which she'd sell at
She got stipulations and likes of which I won't bore you with,
but her big worry,
if the buyer on his own nickel
were to put a new schoolhouse up elsewhere,
would Mrs. Bullock be loathe
to leave the Chez?
Why would she be loathe to leave it?
Can I take that as a "no" as if from your wife's own lips?
Yeah
Thank you
Sorry to hold you up
"Be quick."
Fucking delicate operation
Jack
One thought he'd engaged a room for you at the other end of the hall
I'm going to it now
Invites me and Tolliver for a chat
What the fuck is in his head?
Does he think he broke me?
Does this cocksucker think he broke me and now we're at his beck and call?
Oh, Jesus Christ, get your head off it
Get your fucking head off it for all the fucking good you're doing down there
That's all I need:
At a perfect juncture you to alter your action and forget your previous method
I didn't alter my action
No?
is my dick in your mouth?
Do I have a hard-on?
Then you change your action
Go back to your previous fucking method
Hmm
Does he construe my forbearance as weakness is that what the fuck nags at me?
Or my
considerations of alternatives for being fucking intimidated
because the time's coming he sees what I'm up to
beyond any fucking mistake,
and I only hope you don't doubt it
Huh, you see?!
Y-y-y-you don't think that counts as altering your action?
You would change your entire fucking mouth pattern
Sorry
Sorry?
Oh, I guess that's okay then
because my goal
before my meeting wasn't to come and clear my fucking head,
not so much as to hear you say you're sorry,
you stupid fucking mutt
Should I go?
No
Tell me who you want in the election
Star for Mayor and Harry Manning for Sheriff
Star for Mayor and Bullock for fucking Sheriff
Bullock yells at you
Get out
Shut up and get out
Does he think I'm fucking afraid?
Young man
Jack
Less throb today, one hopes, in the phantom digit
Not to fucking mention elsewhere, huh?
Might I ask you what you know of a Miss Stubbs that owns the Chez Ami?
Whoremistress
Not presently active, I'm told
Hearst's geologist killed three of her girls
The three he didn't she hid under canvas and spirited out of camp
Now lets her place as a schoolhouse
My impression,
she donates it
To cleanse the camp's idea of her?
Would that base her turning away a theater type's offer to buy?
Wouldn't enter into it
Cares for a gut-shot shitbird no one in camp has time for,
nor she has any love for either
Loyal, see?
That type
Some sentimentality do you suppose,
about the building itself?
Might that account for her holding on?
I wouldn't know, Jack
She's all right
Must think I'm a fucking dog,
forgives the blow,
first friendly scratch of the ear
Invites me back to his rooms, fucking Hearst
Shall I accompany
as your second?
My obvious unsuitability
might confuse him
Do survive
E.B
The titans gather
Swearengen
Tolliver
Do we now assault Olympus?
Quiet, E.B
I think Cochran's a lunger
Bit motley ourselves, huh?
What would you make that livery worth?
I'd have to look into it
I need a figure now
if you made me say without investigating
Laying by for the future
Very forward looking
Oh, I'm keen-eyed
Ahead and behind
Your mark would go there
I'll sign my names, Mrs. Garret
I've been lettered since I was 12
Since you can read,
you may wish to examine my nameplate
Mrs. Ellsworth, I'm
I'm very sorry and
very very apologetic
Perhaps you would finish signing over there while I tend to Mr. Bullock
Opened an account
Mr. Bullock
I'd like that drunk Steve to have a loan
$1200, title to the livery as collateral
I'll cosign the note
Has Steve clear title?
He will
once he's bought out Hostetler
That's what the money's for
What is Steve-the-Drunk's surname?
Fields
$1200, Trixie,
payable to a Mr. Steve Fields
upon his signature and submission of title to the livery,
Mr. Bullock to cosign
All right
Thank you
My back's in frank rebellion
Uh, gentlemen,
will you mind if I keep to this angles?
Hang upside down from the ceiling for all of me
It may come to that
Mr. Swearengen, I will take your silence for assent
We pass another milestone
Bank of Deadwood opens its doors
Is not Mrs. Ellsworth a dynamo?
Let's find one and send it to her
What's the occasion?
I have my physician to see
How are you indisposed, Mr. Swearengen?
Sick at the stomach
Would you wish to leave now?
Mr. Tolliver can report our conversation
Tough it out, Al,
like me that's guts is more outside his pants than in
The occasion?
The camp comes to such an hour I'd have us reach a new understanding
The "hour" meaning elections
I am given pause by the
quality of…
certain of the likely victors
But I have
come to believe as well that
my temperament ill suits me for
environments such as this one must become
And other opportunities presenting themselves elsewhere,
I may best serve my own interests here by standing at some remove
Are you leaving?
Can you say it straight out before I have a fucking birthday?
I will be coming and going,
is that straight out enough?
What's the task you'd give us?
And what's our fuckin' piece for doing 'em?
Al
Shut up
To not let become over-onerous my interests encounter
with the camp's retrogressive elements
Meaning what, you phony bastard?
Who do we kill?
What's our pay?
It ain't fair to make it that simple, Al
Fuck you
He took the pick to me simple enough
We will get to numbers quickly once we've agreed in principle
Numbers are the only principle I believe in,
and naming what the numbers buy
when you and him
come to 'em,
tell fucking Adams and he'll bring you my reply later
Him and me,
we've had our last word
What have the Gods decreed?
Too fearful and upset to relive it, E.B
We do agree in principle?
Oh, Yes, Sir
Numbers and acts is what's left to discuss
Sounds like a Bible study, don't it?
Charlie read me the telegram,
then I seen 'em come into camp
My exact fucking thought,
"Look, Jane,
two dead Niggers leading a dead fucking horse."
Matter came to rope,
Steve the drunk to cinch the noose
Charlie's right for the first time in months
Fucking Steve
The exact type malicious cocksucker tars every fucking drunk with his brush
Anyway,
here's Trixie with the loan documents
This succeeds, Bullock,
what you're trying to work out here,
I will doff hat to you and no fucking mistake
Just don't let her take off her boots
Did you know Miss Stubbs might sell her place?
You gotta fucking sign
Lot of shitbags hang around a bank
Did you ever fucking notice?
Asshole
Trailing clouds of glory
Do you read wordsworth?
I do not, Madam, no
How do you come to ask?
You've just quoted him
Well, I have a digest from which I memorize,
suppressing the authors' names
Enjoy your supper
When
will I raise courage to search that woman's room?
Thank you
My pleasure
Don't look to take her order
She likes to draw awhile before she eats
"Bone weary but soldering on."
Bellegarde as a soldier?
He is an actor after all
But unless you would build a new schoolhouse for Mrs. Bullock to teach the camp's children in,
I couldn't even begin to entertain the idea of a sale
The most natural and constructive of stipulations, Miss Stubbs
At your expense, I hope you understand
I do
And may I submit to you now
my offer?
Please do
Very generous
Thank you
We've an agreement?
Far as the schoolhouse…
and its costs?
Absolutely separate,
my obligation in that regard
Those'd be exclusive
Exactly
They come to an understanding
She seems quite thin
Might be where he first went wrong,
learning to read and cipher
Why ain't he sign first?
Why ain't I half a foot taller?
You're who I came to first
Order's right and amount is fair
And once Steve signs, then I will
I'm not a Goddamn errand boy, Hostetler,
to mule this thing back and forth
Give it to me
Let me forge Steve's name
I ain't gonna be first to sign and look a cunt when he don't
Nigger, nigger, nigger
Where the fuck have you been?
I was looking for someone whose name you told me never to say again
Amongst further instructions including
not to look for him when he's fucking disappeared
Well, I held off saying where I was
I can repose
no truth in someone who traffics with that type douche bag
I don't think Hawkeye's a douche bag
Who you believe you can salvage, Adams,
is the douche bag you must avoid,
and no effort of yours can preclude some point past help
And you yourself, being his consort,
in similar fucking straights
And all the energies I've poured into you gone for naught
I vow on the fucking subject I find you dead 'cause of him,
I'll kick your corpse in the ear for the waste of my fucking time
Anyways, what'd you want?
I've named you to represent me in my dealings with fucking Hearst
Tolliver too, in that connection
With Tolliver in connection with Hearst?
As he's put us in tandem, fucking Hearst
You and Tolliver?
If I sought an echo, Adams,
I'd now be addressing a fucking mountain
I'm in waters I don't know,
nor soundings I can take
To bring me the knowledge I need,
my second needs to seem capable of disloyalty
If that's supposed to be a compliment, thanks
Get the fuck out
Out out
Go
Get out
Which is to say, being loyal,
he can forego loyalty's display
Like not searching out a friend who don't want to be found
Just hoping he makes his way back, hmm?
How's Dan gonna take your choosing me?
That's my fucking problem to deal with
Jack, how'd it go with that place?
One has agreed beyond purchase to construct a new schoolhouse elsewhere
That should go up prior,
not to interrupt the fucking teacher
Your law-giving tone is noted
Lovely smile
She
sucks
my prick
Her methods deserted her completely
Might
varying
the hour
produce a different outcome?
What's the hour's relevance?
It's her technique's fuckin' awry
Anyway, Jack,
gotta get my ear pissed in
I'm glad about your place
Thank you, young man
Glad you're still amongst us
Nor, one imagines,
is the local creek rife with oysters
I'm onboard, Bullock
And you are looking at a grateful man,
and who ain't appreciated you previous the way he does now
Sign
We've accomplished something here today!
Take this agreement and this pen,
Go over to that livery and get that Nigger's signature
I will
Sign the fucking thing first
Let's not lose our sense of proportion this late phase in the process
Sign it!
The Nigger signs and then I'll accept
You know you hurt my feelings
Dan
That's the long and short of it, Al
You fucking pick Adams to represent you,
you hurt my fucking feelings and that is the fucking matter's end
Would you go against me?
That is not what we're talking about
You know I'd never break loyalty
That don't mean my feelings can't get hurt
Fucking point is you'd never go against me
Tolliver knows
I need someone he don't know that about
I don't think Silas would go agin you neither
You and him haven't been through,
me and him haven't been through what me and you've been through
Hmm
Not by a long shot
So more than an opinion ain't possible
Still, I'd be fucking surprised if either of us was mistaken
Me too
Fucking Doc
What's his problem?
Thank he's a fucking lunger
Jesus Christ,
it is one fucking thing after another
Observe a decent interval,
and we'll give it another fucking whirl
Keep 'em separate,
agree on a time tomorrow when their dicks will be down,
have 'em sign simultaneous
Petite and quite beautiful your mother is,
for being a financial powerhouse
Of service to the camp,
turning her mine into houses and the like getting built,
businesses begun
Some for people that'll never know her name
I'll take the air,
just briefly
I'll continue to be beaten at checkers
Any fucking domicile but the graveyarn suits me fine
Don't you worry about me
I got things taken care of over here
I don't know either
But I do know
that you're welcome wherever I go
Is Mose invited to the new destination?
Because I'd think you'd need to widen some doorways if he is
Haven't talked to Mose about it
Well, he can be the watchman then
I have no issue with that
We'll figure the rest out…
when time comes
Where would the stage be?
I don't know
Yeah, I don't know either
Ain't our line I guess
That they agreed tonight
is no guarantee what they'll do at 10:00 in the morning
Please see that no harm comes to that horse
I will
Then after the watches were synchronized,
another hour studying them like idiots to see if one gained on the other
Sol
It's not the fucking hour
It's not the fucking vantage of the chair
It's you
that's changed the level of your suction somehow
That's the fucking sum and substance of it
Maybe if I get up on my knees?
You're the cocksucker
Change the fucking angle
Hey, Jesus Christ,
you'll turn me inside out
Come on
Advice from third fucking parties…
place a table on the boardwalk,
people can jot their suggestions,
roll in the much of the thoroughfare in gales of fucking laughter
I did not shame myself
I keep an open mind in that area
Kid yourself about your behavior,
you'll never learn a fuckin' thing
I knew what was coming too
Fucking Captain,
holding me down
I knew what the fuck was next
When he chopped off your finger?
He didn't chop off my finger
Hearst chopped my fucking finger off
The other fuck held me down
They hold you down, you
you can't get at them to help yourself
Fucking cold in here anyway
You want a blanket?
If I do I'll put it round me
You ain't boss of the fucking bedclothes
They hold you down from behind,
then you wonder why you're helpless
How the fuck could you not be?!
I don't like it either
Another one that held me down,
that fuckin' proctor when I tried to get to that ship
He fuckin' held me,
fuckin' wouldn't let me go
Fucking my mind, you see?
She was being restrainded
Couldn't get back off that had got on the boat to New Orleans to go suck prick in Georgia
She changed her mind and
and I was being restrained by that fat bastard orphanage proctor
Anyway, that's it
That's the end of it
That's the fucking conclusion
Christ, I'd have wished to
though probably she'd have thrown me overboard anyway,
but I'd have wished to get to that fucking ship
But I was being restrained
I couldn't get from where she'd left me
He held me to that bed,
her calling from the ship that had changed her mind
I don't like it either
No, huh?
What?
When they hold you down
I guess I do that, huh, with your fucking hair?
No
No?
Well, bless you for a fucking fibber
