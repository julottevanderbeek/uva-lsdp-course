Auntie.
- My, aren't they handsome!
- Aunt Agatha!
At my age a lady no longer
has to hide...
her admiration for handsome men.
- What are they?
- Iroquois.
- Are they friendly?
- I don't call them poisonous snakes...
They're my friend on account
that they don't bite me.
Jonathan said they are so peaceful.
Oh, he is an artist.
He prefers not to see things.
Snakes is snakes.
Do they mean to make trouble?
They never tell what they mean, ma'am.
Especially them Tuscaroras from the south.
They are the ones to look out for.
I thought you said they were Iroquois?
They are all Iroquois, miss.
The French give them names
to the Mohawks, Oneidas...
Tuscaroras, Cayugas and the Senecas
when they joined up together.
This is all Mohawk country.
The ones with the shaved heads
is Mohawks...
The long hairs are Tuscaroras.
They are first grade fighters
them Mohawks.
There ain't nobody, not even the French or
the British have ever beat them in a battle.
How soon do we reach Fort Auldin?
About midday,
if we don't have no trouble.
There is the Fort.
How do I look, Aunt Agatha?
Like a lady going to tea.
Uncle, you don't approve.
When a woman puts on her war paint...
she's more dangerous than any Mohawk.
Except that we like our scalps
with something under them.
Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Have them drive that wagon
back to the arsenal.
Keep a guard posted until
it is unloaded.
Yes, sir.
- Something precious?
- Muskets and gunpowder.
But there is something really precious.
She appears already
be well guarded.
The chaperone may need relieve.
Excuse me.
May I present myself, ma'am?
I'm Captain Langley.
commander at Fort Auldin.
How do you do?
My niece, Cynthia Stanhope.
I'm Agatha Stanhope.
We've come to visit mister
Jonathan Adams, the painter.
- Do you know him?
- Yes, ma'am.
Where does he live?
You don't need that frosty look.
My niece is his fiancee.
Is he expecting you?
- No, I wanted to surprise him.
- You will.
Do you know where I might find him?
Uh, just a moment.
Clem. Clem Jones.
Come over here, please.
Yes, Captain?
Clem, these ladies look for
Jonathan Adams.
So are all the other ladies.
Clem, Miss. Cynthia Stanhope
is Jonathan's fiancee.
No, this is not so funny.
He knows about this?
My good man we did not come here to
discuss our personal affairs with you.
We simply want to know where
Mr. Jonathan Adams lives...
And where he is at this moment.
And that is all. Thank you.
- You're very welcome.
- Captain Langley?
- Clem, where is Adams?
- Out there, some place.
With all those frightening Indians?
There is nothing to
be afraid of, ma'am.
The Indians are about
our friends right now.
I will certainly consider your
lacks in your responsibilities...
if you allowed him to go out there
without an adequate escort.
Oh, he's not alone.
He took a cow along and
my daughter Greta.
Jonathan...
I'm hurting all over.
Oh, I'm sorry, Greta.
Rest a while.
- I'm very beautiful.
- And the cow?
It is a cow.
Why are you laughing?
I always laugh when someone else laughs.
It is my disposition.
And if someone should cry?
A woman enjoys to cry almost
as much as she does to laugh.
That feels wonderful.
I know. I do it for
my father all the time.
You know how to do everything
to make a man happy.
That too is my disposation.
- When a man kisses you?
- I kiss him.
- You have a lot of disposations, Greta.
- I am happy with them.
You know I should marry
a girl like you.
You're so very sweet to say that.
You should not marry me.
I am too stupid for you.
May the Lord protect me
from a brainy women.
Not as if she's as brainy as you.
like my father.
I'll marry a farmer. Stupid like me.
We'll have many children and we'll
be always together until we die.
I'm beginning to think you're the
smartest woman I've ever known.
I feel happy to be smart.
Who will lead me to the chief Kowanen?
Rabbits do not talk, men do.
And the crow screams from
the highest branch...
because it is afraid to
touch its feet to the ground.
Now will you answer me?
I will answer when you tell me
why you must see him.
Since when does the Great Kowanen...
permit boys to decide who will
and who will not see him?
- Your tongue is too long.
- You will not shorten it.
I'm in your village as a friend.
Your laws protect me.
I am Keoga, son of Kowanen.
I will carry your message.
Then tell your father that
I've come to give him warning.
Of what?
More settlers and more muskets.
White Man Butler says
he brings you warning...
of new settlers and more muskets.
Greetings, Kowanen.
My son says you bring a warning.
Numbers tell more than words.
Today 61 settlers and a wagon load
of muskets arrived at Fort Auldin.
Why is this a warning?
Whose land will the settlers
turn into plowed fields?
There is plenty of land.
Against whom will the
muskets be used?
It is wise to be strong for this
keeps your enemies peaceful.
It is talked that
many more soldiers will come.
The eagle is not afraid of the mole.
Those were my father's words.
And he is dead.
And we, the once proud Tuscaroras...
are driven from our land by whites...
And come like beggars to
our friends the Mohawks...
For a handful of corn...
And a piece of earth on which
to spread our blankets.
He was advised not to make war.
There was no peace without surrender.
They came one by one until they
swarmed like ants all over us.
And left us nothing but
a choice of how to die.
What is happening here...
...is I saw it happen there.
The Great Spirit brought the
Iroquois to the Tree of Peace...
And taught us to listen to
the eagle that sees far.
And the wise men told us we must...
bind ourselves together by holding
each other hands so strongly...
nothing could break them apart.
White men can not destroy us
unless we forget...
The Great Laws and so
destroy ourselves first.
I will make no war on the white man.
Why do you want us to
fight your own people?
They are not my people!
Once there was no greater
warrior then your father.
- He is getting old.
- His spirit is gone.
I do not understand him.
Let us take the muskets so they
will not be used against us.
Onida.
Will you help us get those muskets?
But if you are caught,
there will be killing.
A Mohawk is not afraid
to die for his land.
Nor a Tuscarora.
Make us a fire and change
this peaceful words...
Until it's too late to die.
The muskets will make us stronger.
You heard what our father said.
I take our father's advice when
I take the muskets.
With my own ears I heard him say...
"It is wise to be strong for
this keeps your enemies peaceful."
Please, Mr. Jones.
The fattest woman of the Fort
will buy this.
She will never try to wear it.
But it will make her happy to
pretend that it is her size.
- When do they close the gates?
- At sunset.
The sun is setting now.
Can anyone get into the Fort...
after the gates are closed?
The gates do not open again
until sunrise.
Aren't you worried about your daughter?
They always get back just
as the gates are closing...
Always...?
It's sunset.
All the Indians outside the wall.
I left my blanket back there.
I do not want to lose it.
Go get it, and hurry up.
Close the gates.
Wagon coming, sir.
Open the gates.
My cow.
Thank you.
Welcome.
I'm gettingtired of keeping
the gates open for you.
Now, don't be too hard on her, Captain.
She does everything to have her portrait.
Close the gates.
Cynthia.
Here.
Cynthia, I wonder on what cloud
did you fly here on?
I gave her a ride on my broom.
Dear Aunt Agatha,
as frightening as ever.
Dear Jonathan,
as flattering as usual...
even in the wilderness.
Oh, that is Greta.
She models for me.
But you were commissioned by
the Massachusetts Associate...
to do 20 landscapes.
And I have not a single painting
without at least...
- one tree in the background.
- Show them to me, Jonathan.
Oh, naturally, naturally. But first you
must get here settled, and talk about...
you, Boston, family and friends.
The paintings can wait.
I'd like to see them now.
If you insist.
Are you coming, Aunt Agatha?
I am not interested in your paintings.
Only in your character.
But you know me better through my work.
I'll will know you with more
pleasure when you're engaging a...
more profitable work instead of...
Painting is my work.
If you made this long journey...
to say the same things
you've been saying...
Please, Jonathan. I do so badly
want to see your pictures.
We won't be gone long.
All these miles, days and days
in a wagon and you...
can't even say
"how do you do" before...
Where are we going anyway?
- To see your pictures.
- Oh, they're over there.
Greta, take care of
the wagon, please.
So, you are his model?
Yes, he works very hard, ma'am.
And very good too.
Look. I'll show you.
- Is that all you?
- I'm very beautiful.
Yes, all together too obviously.
Very interesting.
Really, Jonathan.
How can you live in this dungeon?
Not at all. I just sleep here.
I keep my belongings here.
Otherwise I'd get outdoors
as long as there is light.
You would have been home
two months ago.
One loses track of time out here.
There are the four seasons,
Easter, Christmas, and...
The days don't seem to count
as calendar days.
Come home with me now
before the winter sets in.
And get involved with politics? No.
I'm a painter, not a politician.
All I wanna do is paint.
You act like
an irresponsible child.
You need someone to take care of you.
You made this long hard journey
to tell me this because...
Because I love you.
- What am I to do about you, Cynthia?
- Marry me.
- Oh, you've already decided?
- Yes.
We have a lovely home in Boston.
And you'll do wonderful portraits
of important people.
And you'll do wonderful portraits
of important people.
Shades of Aunt Agatha.
- That's not very kind.
- Forgive me.
I'm hungry.
How can you think of
food at a time like this?
Cynthia, can you think of
anything more accelerating?
- I just can't understand you.
- And you mustn't.
You see, you risk
propriety if you do.
And where would a gentle woman
be without her precious propriety?
In any event, a man with full
stomach is much easier to handle.
- That's from a gentle woman
and propriety... - Cynthia.
Good appetite.
The belle of Fort Auldin.
- She should be rung every hour as a warning
to all decent young people. - Madam...
Miss, sir. Because my wit
made me laugh...
every time a man proposed.
In due time, the joke was on me.
Oh, there you are, Cynthia.
- This is Mr. Butler.
- How do you do?
You have already met Captain Langley.
I presume you two gentlemen
know each other.
You can hardly avoid
knowing each other...
in a community as small as this.
Have you done anything worth
looking at, Cynthia?
There're some very interesting things.
Mr. Adams has not thought
to show us any of his work.
I didn't think you were
interested, Mr. Butler.
Anything that happens in the
Mohawk valley is of interest to me.
Have you been here very long?
I was born here, Miss. Stanhope.
My family was the only white family
in this area.
Then settlers began coming in.
I used to think of this entire
valley as my personal property.
Well, weren't the Indians
here before you?
The Indians are savages and have
no more rights than animals.
The Spaniards knew
what they were doing...
when they made slaves of them.
No one will ever make
a slave of an Iroquoi.
Then they should be slaughtered
or they'll slaughter us.
No one will listen to me.
They will plow their fields and dig
their graves at the same time.
Settlers will come,
then the preachers...
...soldiers and even painters.
Squeeze the great valley
into a small frame.
And that's the end of
freedom to breathe.
Idiots.
What a frightening man!
I never can decide
which he hates more.
The Indians or the settlers?
I'm not sure he's quite sane.
He is wrong about the Indians,
I know that.
If we leave them alone,
they leave us alone.
Why don't you go out?
Do something!
They'll get along
fine without me.
Hold your fire.
Stop shooting at shadows before
you slaughter each other.
They're most likely gone by now.
Form a detail and search the
Fort from one end to the other.
- How did they get in here?
- A fine bunch of soldiers!
I'll find out how they got in here.
Well, come on, sit down.
Finish your supper.
Eat? At a time like this?
Maybe you'd rather go to
your room and go to sleep.
Who could sleep with all this
commotion going on?
By the time you're ready
for bed, it all will be over.
I'm a rather tired, Aunt Agatha.
Somebody better make certain
there are no Indians...
in our room ready to scalp us.
Come along.
Any Indians in here?
You, fool.
You've got a long journey.
Sleep late tomorrow morning.
- What will you be doing?
- Working.
With that girl?
With that girl and the cow too.
The picture isn't finished yet.
Sleep, my dear.
Good night, Aunt Agatha.
A long face doesn't stand a chance
against ammunition in the right place.
Beautiful.
- Let me go.
- No.
Then kill me.
I like beautiful things.
I like them alive.
I'd rather paint you.
Magnificent.
Your eyes are like lightning.
I know it is in that painters
fellow's room.
All right. Let's go.
Hide over there, hurry up.
There she is.
I built this tunnel 10 years ago...
So we can get the Indians from behind.
If they were attacking us.
Someone must have opened
it from inside.
You've been entertaining
any Indians lately?
No more than usual.
Fetch a can of gunpowder.
Everything has been peaceful so long,
I plumb forgot about that tunnel.
What kind of Indians got in
tonight, Captain?
I don't know.
Mean, just plain mean.
They kill for the love of killing.
They should be skinned alive
every one of them.
That dirty, mean, ignorant Indians.
While letting you have take
their land from them?
Whose side you're on?
Nobody's. I'm a painter.
You sound like an Indian-lover,
Mister painter.
I have no reason to hate them.
You seem to think of tonight:
Maybe it was our fault.
If you don't like how we do
around here, you can get off.
Messing around with pictures ain't
certainly gonna help this valley.
Put it in the tunnel.
Sorry.
We'll double the guards
and keep on searching.
- You're all right?
- Yes. Thank you.
I guess you have to stay here
until tomorrow morning.
And then I'll smuggle you out
in my wagon.
Why?
Maybe because I have no idea.
You're not like the others.
People have been telling me
that since I was 6...
- The trouble is they don't like me.
- That's too bad.
Don't be so timid.
I only want to see
the other side of your face.
Magnificent.
You must let me paint you.
I'm a bit sorry but
it's the best I have to offer.
Good night.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Jonathan is gonna fetch the cow.
I wonder why he bothers
to paint the cow when...
he has already you in the picture.
The cow is expected by
the Massachusetts Associate.
I am surprised.
Is it true that men in England
carry hot water jugs...
when they go courting a lady?
Good morning, Greta.
Good morning, Cynthia.
Good morning, Jonathan.
Ah, perfect light today.
I don't want to lose it.
- I'd like to come along, Jonathan.
- After last night?
I wouldn't think of it. There's no telling
what those Mohawks might be up to today.
You shouldn't go either.
I carry a beautiful amulet.
It will protect me.
Oh, I didn't mean you, Greta.
You can't go along either.
I'm only painting the cow today.
See you at sundown.
- Who will get your lunch?
- I will milk the cow.
Open the gates.
Anyone leaving the Fort today
does so at his own risk.
All right. Open the gates.
Open the gates.
You can come out now.
- They're angry with you.
- They'll get over it.
Which is in love with you?
Neither one.
- And yet they kiss you?
- It amuses them.
An Indian woman does not kiss,
not even for amusement.
Come up here next to me.
Onida, I'm gonna kiss you.
And just why are you laughing?
You look so long-faced and
your mouth became little.
You're supposed to close your eyes
when you are kissed.
Do I close my eyes to watch the sunset?
What does that have to do with it?
The sunset is as beautiful as
the spring flowers...
Or silvery trail that leaves
the light on the water.
The eyes open to welcome beauty.
They close only to
shut out ugliness.
So kissing must be ugly.
The way you put it,
it sounds logical.
Only it isn't.
- Are you married, Onida?
- No, not yet.
Why not?
I'm sure there are many...
There are many and there
are none, but I'm afraid.
Afraid of what?
The white man.
What he will do to us.
I heard you talk to that man
in your room.
There was no hate in your words.
Your heart was good.
Come to our village.
Learn about us.
So that you may tell
your people that...
you were shown that
we can live in peace.
And let me paint what I see?
- Get in the back.
- I will not, I...
Why are you with the white man?
Because you, my half grown brother,
and the brave Tuscarora warrior...
- left me behind.
- We had no chance.
You will have plenty of chance
to explain to our father.
You may come back to
your place, white man.
The fire is out and even the
smoke crawls on the ground...
like a frightened dog.
Come out.
Must they always talk so much?
They're wasting their breath
if they talk about me.
I'm no Mohawk.
You are an Iroquoi and my father
is chief of all the Iroquois.
When a young fire burns so thirstily,
that it's plain it reach for a tree...
It must be put out before
it burns down the park.
Not put out, but made to
burn where it should.
They broke the peace when
I told them not to.
Bowhawah, the Tuscarora
led them to it.
A guest must respect
the house of his host.
Youth and hate make dangerous thoughts.
He has nothing left but revenge.
We must try to understand.
It hurts.
Be more gentle, Onida.
The white man is tender...
Like a young pig
cries at the smallest pain.
Bokhawah, you talk like a fool.
A man would not say that and live.
Now you talk like a forceful fool.
Stand up, Keoga.
How brave you are, to
fight a half grown boy.
Are you all right?
You have good legs, Keoga.
But you better put on
some more size...
before you challenge
a man that big.
- Will you teach me how to...
- Sure, I'll teach you.
A good guest does not create
disturbances in his host's house...
I beg you to forgive me.
And please do not be too hard.
- I told you he was our friend, father.
- I believe it.
You'll be welcome always
where ever there is a Mohawk.
I'll paint pictures of you,
Kowanen, and your ways.
I'll show them to my people.
So that they'll know you better.
He who fills his mouth with
big words ends by eating dirt.
- Any sign of the wagon
yet, sergeant? - No, sir.
Alright, close the gates.
Has he ever stayed out
this late before?
No, miss.
It is very disturbing.
Most likely he was killed
by the Indians.
What a horrible man!
He should not say those bad
things, unless it's true.
What else can it be?
There aren't any pretty women
out there. Or are there?
I insist that you and
your soldiers make an...
immediate search for that man.
- And where do we search for him?
- I'd start with the Mohawk village.
- But he may not be agreeing.
- In any doubt.
We don't happen to be
at war with the Mohawks.
What was that last night?
A social visit?
If you won't send your soldiers...
I'll gather the settlers
and we will go ourselves.
The gates are closed, Mr. Butler.
Neither you nor anyone else
goes out of this fort tonight.
There is no reason yet to believe
Jonathan has trouble...
with the Mohawks.
Maybe he lost his cow
and is still looking for it.
What are they singing?
They tell of Dekaniwida
who brought love, and laughter...
and the Tree of Peace to the Iroquois.
I didn't know any Indian
could laugh like you.
There is a small bird seen and
a hawk circles its nest.
That is for love and peace. You might
as well have told me that the Indians...
have wings and fly among the angels.
They do.
Why has the white man
never learned to love?
Does the hawk love when he
circles the small bird's nest?
Then you do know love.
As you know peace and laughter.
I'm glad.
And from Ontario...
came Dekaniwida,
father of the Iroquois...
to plant peace beside the lake...
Peace with roots from the heaven.
- Throw it back.
- Come on and get it.
- Throw it back.
- Come and get it.
Now you get it.
But it has been days.
How can you stand by and
do nothing all this time?
He knew it was not a good time
to leave the Fort.
He is city bred,
he doesn't understand these things.
He didn't realize how
dangerous it was.
He should have.
He has been here long enough.
He has most likely found
out the truth by now.
How can you laugh?
They laugh because they are men
and try to hide with laughter...
that they are afraid to go
and look for Jonathan.
That is why they laugh.
I ain't fighting no Indians
for that painter fellow.
My crops needs more
care than he does.
Let this go unpunished and you'll
lose your lives as well as crops.
Butler, I will not have you
start a war against the Mohawks.
The war has started, Captain.
That senseless little raid several
nights ago. And now this.
If you don't have got any courage they'll come
in one night and slaughter every one of you.
- He's right.
- He is a stupid.
The Iroquois are thousands and
we are maybe two hundred.
How can we punish them?
Well, that's your problem and you
have to solve it without us.
- We're going back to Boston.
- Yes, that is very wise.
I'm not leaving until I know
what happened to Jonathan.
I always knew I'd die a spinster.
Now, where is he going?
- The Captain from the fort.
- Nothing matter.
Is this the white friend's
greeting to Kowanen?
I beg your forgiveness, Kowanen.
This man has gone for days.
We thought him dead or lost.
After all my worrying,
it struck me funny...
to find him peaceful employing
painting your portrait.
You'd do better
not to be angry with him.
That comes now, with your permission.
I should beat your brains in for
all the troubles you've caused.
- What has he done?
- About driven me crazy, that's all.
The settlers don't understand
the Iroquois, Kowanen.
They listen to
this madman, Butler.
who frightens them with predictions
of massacres by painted redskins.
When Jonathan failed to return...
he said that the Indians
killed him and started...
agitating for a war against you...
as punishment for your crime.
He's got the people all stirred up.
I guess I better get back to
Fort as quickly as possible.
Show myself alive and happy.
- Will you be back?
- Quickly as a horse can run.
Keoga, you will go with them.
He who plans war does not send...
his own son into the enemy camp.
They'll understand that better
than ten thousand words.
It's time to look upon Kowanen
and his wife, Minikah.
I thank my guard for them,
their wisdom and their goodness.
Long live to you.
And to you, long life.
How soon will be it?
I have got some paintings to take
and bring back some more supplies.
I'll take the wagon.
We'd better take back that cow too.
Then I won't wait for you.
And try to get in before sundown.
We'll be back with tomorrow's sun.
- Keoga.
- Yes.
Be careful of your manners
among the white people.
Yes, mother.
I don't understand.
He promised to be here by sundown.
Could something have happened?
I can't think of anything.
Everything was certainly
peaceful enough when I left.
It is Jonathan. When he's
painting he forgets time.
You might as well get some sleep.
Good evening.
You should know better than to
hide in shadows as a Indian warrior.
An Indian warrior?
I thought the Indians were peaceful.
You said so yourself, Captain.
And you know better than anyone
how to read the Indian mind.
Evacuate the fort. Get out of the valley.
Or you'll all be dead within 24 hours.
You worry too much Mr. Butler,
you will get bad stomach trouble.
On this day we are met together.
The Great Spirit has appointed this day.
Now this day we are met
because of this death.
Now into the ground will he
be born, the young Keoga.
Now then wipe away
the falling tears.
So that peacefully we may look around.
And then something stops your ears.
With care we remove whatever it is...
So you will hear the words to be said.
There is a stoppage in your throat.
And we take it away that
you may speak your hearts.
Every day we are losing our men
into the earth they are born.
Also our women and children.
And our grandchildren.
So that you are sitting
in the midst of blood.
I see the ghosts of the Tuscaroras
walking through the woods.
And with them, I see
the ghosts of the Mohawks.
For you are dead.
Dead as Keoga is dead.
Killed, as Keoga was killed...
by the white men.
And the ghosts must walk
the earth until the last day...
Because the white man has
plowed the burial ground.
And there is no place
for the dead to rest.
This is what I see, as I see
Keoga dead before me.
And no man saying the blood
of 100 white men...
for each drop of young Keoga's blood.
You grieve because you have
not the courage to fight.
You are dead! Dead!
No! No!
Bokhawah speaks angry words.
And maybe with reason.
But not he nor I,
no matter what is in our hearts...
can make war.
That only the Council can decide.
And you will talk for peace because
your woman owns your mind...
And the white man owns
your daughter.
I've seen it with my own eyes.
No!
Onida, go to the house.
The white man killed my son...
You will not kill my daughter.
I love your daughter.
The white man does not know love.
Only conquest.
Let the runners go to all the chiefs
of the clans for a war council.
Why did they kill my brother?
I don't know, Onida.
I can't even begin to understand.
- They must have known they'd start a war.
- The madness about this thing.
If the moon would make
ugly faces at the sun...
The stars would chasing
each other like mad dogs.
For they are mad dogs these white men
that would make war to
destroy each other.
What are they made of?
They who deny their own people.
What white man has done that?
This man, Butler, who came to tell
my father of the new muskets.
Butler. Why?
To make my father war
against the settlers.
Jonathan, you must leave
while there is still time.
If the council decides for war,
and they will...
they will kill you first.
- But why would Butler...
- It doesn't matter now.
Jonathan, think of yourself.
You are a white man.
Blood for blood.
Jonathan for Keoga.
They will kill you and throw
your body to the gate of the fort.
And that would be
the declaration of war.
- They decided the war.
- I will try to stop them.
No, Jonathan, they will kill you.
Go now!
- Kowanen, I'm your friend.
- You're a white man.
Regardless I'm still your friend.
You must not blame all
white men for this murder.
Let me find out first what
mad man who did this thing.
We offered peace,
they gave us death.
Now they will have war.
Let his body carry the
flaming war arrows...
- to the white men.
- So be it.
Mother, mother.
They have taken Jonathan.
- He is our enemy.
- You know he isn't.
I know his skin is white.
I do not know the color of his heart...
Because I can not see it.
You do not sound like my mother.
- I am also Keoga's mother.
- I loved Keoga.
You also love the white man.
And I will hate those who hate him.
And I will kill those who kill him.
Even if it would be my own father.
If the law is blood for blood,
then I too must obey this law.
It is a man made law.
For men do nothing they enjoy
so much as dying...
Knowing that women would
go on making new lives...
to take the place of all deaths.
What are you waiting for?
Go, free this man before...
they cut him up into pieces,
the blood thirsty fools.
Don't move.
It will not be so quick,
white man, there will be fire.
And the tearing of the skin...
No, you will not die fast.
You will die piece by piece.
And I shall take the first.
Onida, cut me loose.
Onida hurry, somebody
might have heard him.
Climb this wall and jump.
- On the other side there will be so much
brush you will not be heard. - Come with me.
I belong with my people
and you with yours.
I'm not leaving without you.
Would it do any good if you stay here
and die instead of warn your people?
You see Jonathan, I keep my
eyes closed when I kiss you.
- Now I know why.
- Tell me.
To love is to close ones eyes
to everything...
Except the beauty of love.
Now go, while my eyes are still closed.
Someone is coming here.
He looks hurt.
Give him a hand.
Tell the colonel we
have had warnings.
We should be able to hold them off a while.
But you better get help as fast as you can.
Yes, sir.
Close the gates.
Open those gates again.
No one else leaves the fort.
I am not a prisoner. I will
not be detained like a prisoner.
We need every men here.
I gave you warning but you
wouldn't listen to me.
Now you expect me to die
with the rest of you.
But I'm not such a fool.
Open those gates.
Why did you give them warning?
What information did you have?
It is enough that I warned them.
You said they would attack
within 24 hours.
That was a good prediction,
wasn't it?
Kowanen's son, Keoga, was murdered
approximately 24 hours ago.
Did you know that, Butler?
What is one Indian to me?
How did you know Keoga was murdered?
It came to me in a vision.
How many shots were in your vision?
As many as it take to kill an Indian.
One is enough for a man
who knows how to shoot.
But there is twice as
much pleasure in two.
And what pleasure was there in going to
Kowanen and tell him about the new muskets?
- That's a lie.
- A Mohawk told me.
You take the word of a Mohawk
against that of a white man?
Mohawks don't lie, Butler.
You know that.
- You killed Keoga because...
- They are coming!
Mister Butler, since you insist...
Open the gates.
Tell the Mohawks we use the
new muskets most regretful...
If you have the chance.
Open. Let me in.
Brace the gates.
Open up. Let me in.
Greta, catch my muskets.
Open up. In mercy's name.
Go inside and get ready to help the
wounded. It will be better for you.
Wait.
Wait.
Fire!
- They are leaving.
- They'll be back.
Greta, bring wine.
Free wine for everybody.
And brandy too.
It's too good for the Indians.
They won't appreciate it.
It's not really as painful.
And how would you know, Miss?
They have run.
- Will they come back?
- With more men.
What if help doesn't arrive in time?
We don't think that way.
We say that we will hold
them up until help arrives.
Jonathan shouldn't be
allowed to fight.
He might be blind or
have his hands wounded.
He mustn't be wasted this way.
He is an artist.
He would not even be a good artist
if he was not first a man.
Today is fighting day.
Even for us women.
I said some nasty things
about you and I'm sorry.
I did not even hear them.
It is my disposition.
Greta.
Do you love Jonathan?
Jonathan does not love me.
Nothing else matters.
It is that way many times.
Love commands but never obeys.
I must bring wine to the men.
They are thirsty.
What are you standing there for?
These people needs tending to.
If we let to live,
come back to Boston.
Not to marry me.
I have no hope anymore.
But to work or at least to live.
I don't know, Cynthia.
I've lots to think about.
We can't hold them off
no longer. Retire!
Get them out.
Block off the windows.
The dead are like leaves
of grass under foot.
And yet they died for nothing.
For who has won this battle?
Neither white men nor Indian.
We hold your prisoner, Kowanen.
But not the great nations
of the Iroquois.
For now the Iroquois will listen
to the warnings of the Tuscaroras.
And the war fires will burn from
the salt ocean till the Great River.
And the white men will be driven
from the lands of the Iroquois
as the French 100 years ago.
Here is the man who killed your son.
He was no men's friend,
not yours nor ours.
He would have us
destroy each other...
to have this valley for his own.
Is it for this man we must
set our world on fire?
Do we give him what he wanted
even now he is dead?
Too many have died
already because of him.
That's all of them.
Take good care of them now.
If you ever come to Boston,
do come and visit us.
You too, Greta. It was really
been wonderful knowing you.
I must say I'll certainly be glad
to get back to Boston...
and civilization, and away from
all these disgusting Indians.
Take my paintings to the
Massachusetts Associate.
There are 11 more than they ordered.
Aren't you coming with us?
No, dear Aunt Agatha.
I'm staying right here.
Goodbye, Cynthia.
Have a good trip.
Love commands but it never obeys.
Greta taught me that.
You always knew that, Cynthia.
You are also a woman.
Greta, I still think you are
the smartest woman I've ever known.
Now we can truly dry our tears.
For the Great Spirit has sent us
a son in the place of...
he who was taken away.
For this reason, we give you
the name of Keoga.
May you be happy
until your spirit leaves us.
Now... go to Onida.
Why are you closing your eyes?
- I'm waiting to be kissed.
- In front of all these people?
Oh, there is something worth
learning from the white man.
