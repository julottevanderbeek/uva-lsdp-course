UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAY
SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO IT?

WHICH TRAIL ARE YOU TAKING?

- WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
GOT TO RIDE THE DAMN WASH?
- 'CAUSE IT'S THE BEST TRAIL.
- YEAH, IT IS.
THAT'S WHY WE CAN'T KEEP
THE DAMN MEXICANS OUT OF IT.
- IF I SEE ANY "DAMN MEXICANS,"
I'LL TELL 'EM HELLO FROM YOU.
-
DID YOU BRING A WALKIE-TALKIE
WITH YOU?
- YUP!
DON'T LEAVE THAT COFFEE CUP
OUT THERE.
- SHIT, DUDE!
WHAT THE HELL?

CACTUS WITH YOU TWO

SCREW THAT SHOT UP!
WE'RE NOT USING MY DAD'S RIFLE
TO SHOOT THAT CLOSE
TO THOSE GUYS.
- OH, HEY, HEY, HEY.
IT'S COOL, IT'S COOL, IT'S COOL.
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU
SHOW KEV AND I
WHAT A SAFE DISTANCE IS
TO BE SHOT AT?
IT'S A KILLER SCOPE

I WAS TRYING TO MISS
THE FUCKING MEXICAN!

SHE'S MOVING, DUDE.
LOOK, LOOK.

- WHAT?
WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE HER THERE!
- YOU WANT TO GO
DOWN THERE, SEAN?
WHEN WE GET BACK,
WE'LL CALL 911
FROM A PAYPHONE OR SOMETHING.
BESIDES, THE MEXICAN GUY
WAS HELPING HER!
-
OH, F--

FIND OUT UNLESS YOU FREAK OUT.
- SHE LOOKED PRETTY BAD
TO ME, DUDE. MAYBE HE HIT HER.
- I DIDN'T HIT HER, YOU DICK!
I WAS AIMING AT THE GROUND!
- SHUT UP, KEVIN!
LOOK, WE GOT TO SWEAR
NOT TO TELL ANYBODY
ABOUT THIS EVER. NOBODY!
BECAUSE IF ANYONE FINDS OUT,
WE'RE ALL SCREWED!
- I'M NOT.
I DIDN'T EVEN SHOOT AT ALL!

DUMBASS.
YOU'RE AN ACCESSORY
TO THE CRIME.

THAT MAY HAVE BEEN AN ATTEMPT
TO STEAL HER HORSE.
THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE IS LOOKING

ANYONE WITH INFORMATION

SCROLL IT DOWN.

- YEAH, OF COURSE YOU DO.
I MEAN, IT'S THE SAME OLD THING
WE HAD WHEN YOU WERE ON THE JOB.
OKAY, WELL,
YOU LET ME KNOW HOW IT GOES.
- GOOD MORNING.
I'M GOING TO BE
TEACHING THE CLASS TODAY.
MRS. EDWARDS HAS HAD
A FAMILY EMERGENCY.
- HEY, DID YOU HEAR
WHAT HAPPENED?
SOME ILLEGALS
KILLED MRS. MCNARY.
- MRS. MCNARY?
- SHE WAS RIDING ON HER RANCH,
AND THEY WERE TRYING
TO STEAL HER HORSE,
AND THEY KILLED HER.

PLEASE TURN AROUND.
- I HAVE TO USE THE BATHROOM.
- SAYS HE'S SURE.
- ROY'S HERE.
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!
COME ON, NOW.
COME ON, BACK OFF.
- THAT'S NOT THE GUY I SAW.
- YOU'RE SURE?
- YEAH, I'M SURE.
- WELL, THEN,
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN TWO.
- WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
- WELL, WE PICKED HIM UP
IN A STOLEN TRUCK, AND...
ONE OF THE THINGS WE FOUND
IN THE TRUCK WAS THIS.
YOU RECOGNIZE THIS?
- YEAH.
- SOON AS WE TOLD HIM
WHAT HAPPENED,
HE STARTED TALKIN'
PRETTY FAST.
HE TOLD US THAT HE
AND ANOTHER GUY
THAT HE WAS TRAVELING WITH
MET UP WITH A WOMAN ON A HORSE,
AND SHE GAVE HIM
THAT BLANKET.
HE SAYS THAT SOMEBODY
WAS SHOOTING AT HIM,
AND THE LADY FELL
OFF HER HORSE AND HIT HER HEAD.
- THAT'S A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT.
- I KNOW, I'M JUST TELLING YOU
WHAT THE MAN SAID,
KEEPING YOU IN THE LOOP
LIKE I PROMISED.
- I SHOULD HAVE SHOT
THAT SON OF A BITCH
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.
- I SAW THAT YOU HAD A FIREARM
ON YOU WHEN WE GOT THERE.
WERE YOU SHOOTIN' AT 'EM, ROY?
- NO.
- YOU SURE?
- YEAH, I'M SURE.
THERE WERE SHOTS.
- THERE WERE SHOTS?
- YEAH, THEY WERE RIFLE SHOTS.
THAT'S WHY I WENT OUT THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
- WELL, WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME THAT BEFORE?
THAT'S PRETTY DAMNED
IMPORTANT.
- I DON'T KNOW, I--
HELL, RANDALL,
I MEAN, WE WAS--
- ALL RIGHT, SOMETHIN' ELSE.

HOW MANY TIMES YOU AND I STOOD
HERE AND WATCHED THESE BOYS
LIE THROUGH THEIR TEETH
JUST SO WE'D SEND 'EM
BACK ACROSS THE LINE
WITH A SPANKING AND A WARNING?
- A BUNCH.
- I KNOW IT'S NOT MUCH
FOR COMFORT,
AND IT AIN'T GONNA
BRING LIVY BACK,
BUT WE GOT HIM,
AND HE'S GONNA BE PUNISHED.
- DID YOU ALREADY
HAVE YOUR BOYS DO A SWEEP?
- YEAH,

BUT NOW I KNOW YOU

¶ ¶
- WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'
UP HERE?
- THIS IS WHERE
THE SHOOTER WAS.
- THAT'S GOT TO BE WELL OVER
ARE YOU SURE IT
WAS FROM HERE?
- I SAW HIM FROM
THAT BLUFF OVER THERE,
ABOVE THE WASH
WHERE LIVY WAS KILLED.
THAT'S WHERE I FOUND THESE.
-ROY--
- FOUND THE LEADS
DOWN IN THE WASH.
MAYBE YOU COULD MATCH SOME
OF THOSE UP
WITH THE LEAD IN THAT BODY
DOWN THERE.
- ROY, YOU KNOW
YOU SHOULDN'T--
YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE MOVED THESE.
HELL, YOU SHOULDN'T
EVEN BE UP HERE.
- THIS IS MY LAND,
RANDALL.
WELL, SOMEBODY'S GOT
TO DO YOUR JOB FOR YOU.
CHECK 'EM OUT.
THEY'RE MARKED.
SHOOTER MUST DO
HIS OWN RELOADS.
- DID YOU GET A
MAKER ON THE VEHICLE?
- NO.
SOME KIND OF A FOUR BY FOUR.
GREEN.
NOT MANY GUYS AROUND
WHO CAN MAKE THAT SHOT.
- YEAH, WELL, THERE'S PLENTY
OF PEOPLE PRETTY ANGRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO LIVY, ROY.
- WELL, THOSE PEOPLE GOT NO
MORE BUSINESS BEIN' ON MY LAND
THAN THE DAMN MEXICANS.
RANDALL, I WANT TO
TALK TO RAMIREZ.
- YOU KNOW
I CAN'T ALLOW THAT.
YOU'RE OFFICIALLY A CIVILIAN.
BESIDES, YOU'RE THE
SPOUSE OF THE VICTIM,
AND THAT MAN
IS THE PRIME SUSPECT.
HOW'S IT GONNA LOOK--
- I SPENT OVER 25 YEARS SITTIN'
IN THE SAME CHAIR YOU
PARK YOUR BUTT IN NOW,
THE CHAIR I PUT YOU IN.
I KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
YOU CAN'T DO AS SHERIFF,
BUT LETTIN' ME TALK TO RAMIREZ
AIN'T ONE OF 'EM.
-
- I HAVE TO...
YOU GOT FIVE MINUTES.
JESUS, ROY.
- YEAH.
IT FIGURES.
- NO.
-
- NO.
- OH, HI.
I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE.
- THAT'S OKAY.
WE'VE JUST BEEN
HERE A FEW MINUTES.
- I'M MARILY.
- HI.
- HOW DO YOU LIKE THE
FRONT OF THE HOUSE?
AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD?
- IT'S GOOD.
- OH, GOOD.
- GOOD.
- I HAVE THE CODE TO THE GARAGE,
AND I CAN OPEN THE FRONT DOOR
AND LET MYSELF IN THAT WAY,
AND THEN I CAN LET YOU IN.
AH, THERE IT IS.
OH.
OH-OH, MY--
-
- SEAN!
SEAN!
SEAN LOUIS PAT!
- WHAT?
- YOUR DAD WANTS TO SEE YOU
IN THE GARAGE!
- WHY?
WHY?
WHY?
-
BUT HE SAID RIGHT NOW.
- THOSE WERE OUT ON THE GROUND
OFF THE SOUTH RIDGE
OF ROY MCNARY'S LAND.
AND MY .30-06 RELOADS.
I HAVEN'T BEEN OUT
THERE HUNTIN', SON.
BESIDES, I ALWAYS
PICK UP MY EMPTIES.
I EVEN MAKE A MARK ON 'EM
WITH A SHARPIE,
JUST SO I CAN TELL
WHICH ONES ARE MINE.
THOSE ARE MINE.
ANY IDEA HOW
THEY GOT OUT THERE, SON?
- WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?
WAS THIS YOUR STUPID IDEA?
DON'T YOU TURN
YOUR BACK ON ME!
- LET ME TALK.
LET ME TALK TO HIM.
WELL, THE BOYS ARE
TELLIN' DIFFERENT STORIES.
TWO OF 'EM ARE SAYIN'
THAT THEY WERE SHOOTING
AT THE MEXICANS 'CAUSE
THEY WERE BEATING ON LIVY
AND TRYIN' TO STEAL
HER HORSE.
- YOU KNOW DAMNED WELL
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.
- DO I?
I MEAN, YOU THOUGHT
THOSE MEXICANS
WERE BEATIN' ON LIVY TOO.
I SAT HERE AND LISTENED TO
YOU TELL ME WHEN YOU PULLED UP,
THAT MEXICAN WAS TRYING TO STEAL
LIVY'S HORSE.
- RANDALL--
- THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.
WHAT--WHAT DO WE GOT
HERE REALLY?
ROY, I MEAN...SO NOW WE KNOW
THAT THE BOYS
WERE SHOOTING AT THE MEXICANS.
LIVY DIDN'T DIE OF
A GUNSHOT WOUND, ROY.
THAT'S A FACT.
HE'S MY SON,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.
- LIVY WAS MY WIFE.
WHO WAS THE SHOOTER?
- WELL, THE BOYS ARE
TELLIN' DIFFERENT STORIES,
AND THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO
BACK EACH OTHER--
- RANDALL.
WHO WAS THE SHOOTER?
- SEAN.
THE SHOOTER WAS SEAN.
FLORA, CAN IT WAIT?
- JUST THOUGHT BOTH YOU
SHERIFFS MIGHT WANT TO KNOW
THAT A LADY CALLED OVER HERE
JUST NOW AND SAID SHE FOUND
A BUNCH OF ILLEGALS HIDING
OUT IN A GARAGE IN PHOENIX.
SHE SAID ONE
OF THE ILLEGALS ASKED HER
TO CALL OVER HERE FOR HER.
SHE SAID THE WOMAN
IS MIGUEL RAMIREZ'S WIFE.
- MELINA RAMIREZ?
-
FLORA?
- JESUS.
I'LL CALL YOU BACK IN A MINUTE.
ROY!
ROY, YOU CAN'T
TAKE HER IN THERE.
- WELL, FLORA AND
I JUST CAME BY.
WE, UH, BOTH HAVE TO PEE.
- OH, STOP!
YOU CAN'T TAKE HER IN THERE!
- NO, NO, DON'T.
- MISS FLORA,
SHE CAN'T BE IN THERE.
YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.
- WHERE ARE THE BOYS AT?
- HM?
- WHERE'S SEAN?
ANYBODY BUT RAMIREZ
BEEN CHARGED YET?
-
- YOU KNOW THOSE BOYS
AREN'T FLIGHT RISK.
NOW, THEY'VE BEEN RELEASED TO
THEIR PARENTS RECOGNIZANCE.
- WELL, THAT'S A DUMB IDEA
SINCE IT WAS ON YOUR
AND THEIR PARENTS RECOGNIZANCE
THAT THE BOYS ARE OUT THERE
POPPIN' OFF ROUNDS AT PEOPLE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
-
-
-
-
-
-
- NO, YOU TELL THEM--
- DID YOU TALK TO THE D.A. YET?
YOU TOLD HIM
WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?
YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT
YOUR BOY'S INVOLVEMENT?
HUH?
-
-
- NO, NO, NO--
-
- YOU GO AHEAD AND YOU CALL HIM,
AND YOU TELL HIM
HOW YOU TAMPERED
WITH THE DAMNED EVIDENCE!
-
- HELLO, SENOR.
-
THANK YOU FOR, UH,
BRINGING MY HOUSE.
-
-
-
- SON-IN-LAW.
- OH,
-
-
- EVENING.
- GOOD EVENING.
- CITIZENSHIP?
- AMERICAN.
- DO YOU HAVE SOME I.D.?
- I DO.
- ROY?
- EDWARD.
- HI, FLORA.
HOW ARE YOU?
- OH, GOOD TO SEE YOU,
EDWARD.
- HEY, ROY,
LISTEN.
I WAS REALLY SORRY
TO HEAR ABOUT LIVY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MEXICO?
- DROPPIN' OFF A FRIEND.
- OKAY.
- OKAY.
- WELL, IT WAS GOOD
TO SEE YOU BOTH.
- SAME HERE.
- YOU CAN'T WALK IN HERE
AND TELL ME THAT RAMIREZ
IS WITHOUT BLAME.
I MEAN, NONE OF THIS WOULD
HAVE HAPPENED IF IT HADN'T BEEN
FOR THOSE GODDAMN MEXICANS
WALKIN' ACROSS YOUR LAND.
- NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED IF YOU'D CHANGED
THE COMBINATION ON YOUR
GODDAMN GUN LOCKER.
- OKAY, BUT YOU GOT TO DO
ONE THING FOR ME.
- THOSE BOYS GOT TO PAY
FOR WHAT THEY DID, RANDALL.
SEAN DOES TOO.
- I KNOW THAT,
AND I KNOW HE DOES,
AND HE'S GONNA HAVE TO LIVE WITH
IT FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.
- SO DO I.
- ALL I'M ASKING YOU
IS THAT YOU SAY SOMETHING
ON HIS BEHALF
AT THE DEPOSITION.
I'M ASKING YOU AS A FATHER,
AND AS A FRIEND.
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
- RANDALL...
THE ONLY WAY I WILL DO THAT
IS IF HE TELLS THE TRUTH
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE.
- HE WILL.
- YOU KNOW, BEING A DUMBASS
IS NO EXCUSE.
- I KNOW THAT.
- ALL RIGHT.
- YOURS?
- MINE AND MY WIFE'S.
-
-
- HORSE MAN.
- OH,
- SHADOW.
- YEAH.
LIVY LOVED HER PONY.
-
- COME ON, PHILLY!
ADVANCE.
- RIGHT.
- OKAY.
OKAY.
-
- YEAH, SO YOU BETTER
GOOD.
-
- OKAY.
