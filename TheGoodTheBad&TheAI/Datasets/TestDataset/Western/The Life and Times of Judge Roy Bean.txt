Door.
Shut the door, squirrel.
Whiskey.
How are you?
Bean. Roy Bean.
Maybe you heard of me.
My picture's on the wall.
On the other side of that wall over there.
Just...
robbed the Granger's Trust
down in Magdalena.
That's no easy pickings.
Bonanza Stud
had his left hand shot half away...
and I picked two pellets
of crude-iron buckshot...
out of my ankle.
I always heard that a man on the dodge
is welcome west of the Pecos.
Maybe I heard wrong.
You heard right.
"Revised Laws and Statutes
of the State of Texas."
What's that doing here?
For the whores to piss on.
Give him a drink of cactus whiskey.
You a bank robber?
You get much out of that Magdalena one?
No.
Enough?
That's right, enough.
Buy me a drink, bank robber?
Listen, when Roy Bean drinks,
everybody drinks.
Give me the money.
Let me get some of that.
I want some of that money!
- Get off him.
- Get him strung.
Yeah, that's right.
Here! Tie it!
Go.
Gun.
Come back here, you son of a bitch!
Kill him! Shoot him!
I'm going to get Marvin.
Come on back here!
I ain't through killing you!
You hear me?
All of your kind, I'll be waiting!
The first time I saw Roy Bean...
he was set on killing me.
Thought I was the Devil, come to take him.
It was an understandable thought,
considering all the carnage...
that he had so recently brought forth.
I'm the Reverend Mr. LaSalle.
"Though I walk in the valley
of the shadow...
"I fear not."
What has happened here?
These men tried to hang me,
and they have been killed for it.
How many of them are there?
A lot of them.
- Who did the killing?
- I did.
They were bad men,
and the whores weren't ladies.
"Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord."
It was.
I'm waiting for the buzzards.
They don't deserve burying.
Maybe they don't...
but they ought to be.
They are a stench and an abomination.
I've got a shovel if you don't.
I buried them
because Christ had died for all of them.
It was his choice, not mine.
I am not one to question the wisdom
of the Almighty.
Get my Bible.
It is in the saddlebag.
I will read over the dead now.
My Bible, please, Mr...
Bean.
- Bean.
- Roy Bean.
Judge Roy Bean.
I am the new law in this area.
- What has qualified you as such?
- I know the law...
since I have spent my entire life
in its flagrant disregard.
I had never killed a man before.
I'd shot at some...
in self-defense or blind fright,
but I never hit anyone.
So God must have directed my bullets.
Why, he even sent an angel...
to deliver this weapon.
Just how do you intend
to dispense this law?
With this. And a rope.
And will you rely again
on the grace of God?
I intend to practice...
and give him some help.
Get on with the reading.
I've turned to the Book of Psalms...
and I will read from Psalm number 58...
which I deem to be appropriate.
"Let their teeth be broken...
"and blunted in their mouths...
"the great teeth of the young lions.
"...he shall take them away
as with a whirlwind...
"both living, and in his wrath.
"The righteous shall rejoice
when he seeth the vengeance...
"he shall wash his feet
in the blood of the wicked.
"So that a man shall say...
"Verily, there is a reward
for the righteous...
"verily, he is a God
that judgeth in the earth."
What of them?
How do they fit
into your scheme of justice?
The law is going to protect them.
It says that somewhere in here.
Where is she?
Who? The angel?
If ever there was one.
¿Dónde está la muchacha?
Traigala aquí.
Does she speak American?
What is your name, señorita?
How are you called?
Marie Elena.
Marie Elena...
I want to thank you for what you done,
is what I want to do.
Maybe you can explain
to these people here...
that I mean them no harm.
Tell them it's going to be a new place.
It's going to be a nice place to live.
I'm the new judge.
There will be law.
There's going to be order,
progress, civilization, peace.
Above all, peace.
And I don't care who I have to kill to get it.
Go on. You tell them that.
Tell them the horses
that belonged to them vermin are theirs.
Their guns.
The land.
Just that place...
That place there, that's mine.
They do not want the horses.
They will take the horses.
They do not want the land.
They are grateful.
They do not need the guns.
You are their patrón.
You mean I own everything
if I do all the getting shot at.
It is an old and fair arrangement.
And somewhat shrewd, I might add.
That brothel there...
it will be my courthouse.
Place to deal out justice,
place to get shot at...
and shoot and hang others from.
That's what it is.
I intend to live there, regardless.
What is it, my child?
I will live there, too.
She will what?
- You don't want me to live there.
- No, I don't.
Not yet, anyway.
Don't you have parents or the like?
Perhaps she could live in that little shack
off to the side.
Perhaps you could live in that little shack
off to the side.
"Blessed is the Lord thy strength,
which teaches thy hand to war...
"and thy fingers to fight."
I shall pray for you, Bean.
This land abounds
in ruffians and varmints.
Their numbers are legion,
their evil skills commensurate.
Piss on them.
That was the first and last time
I saw Judge Roy Bean.
I never got back to that country,
and died of dysentery in old Mexico.
I haven't seen him since,
so he probably went to Hell.
Lillie Langtry.
The Jersey Lily.
Fairest voice, softest hair,
eyes the color of a starlit night.
The most beautiful woman in all creation.
That's who that is.
Why, even princes drink champagne
from her slipper.
Look at the color of that hair.
I cannot see any color.
That's 'cause it's a bad likeness.
But even a bad likeness of Lillie Langtry...
is worth most women in the flesh.
Get back in there, child.
Who are you?
Big Bart Jackson.
This is my gang.
Tector Crites...
Whorehouse Lucky Jim...
Nick The Grub, Fermel Parlee.
- You outlaws?
- We're honest men.
Merely been driven to a life
beyond the law by circumstances.
You ever been here before?
Don't even know where I am now.
It's the Eagle's Nest,
Vinegarroon County, Texas.
Vinegarroon.
What is a "vinegarroon"?
Well, it's a Mexican word.
Means whiptail scorpion, mean as hell.
I don't want trouble from you...
only food, water
and some cactus whiskey...
if that sign's not an idle boast.
Nothing on that sign is an idle boast.
Including the law.
Got any money?
Not much.
We tried to rob the Three Rivers Flyer.
Couldn't catch him.
The passengers shot at us
from windows for sport.
Not easy being an outlaw
in times like these.
Ordinarily, I'd take you in my court
and try you and hang you.
But if you got the money for whiskey,
we can dispense with those proceedings.
- Do you get much judging around here?
- What do you mean?
I mean, what's the use of being a judge
if you ain't got no one to law?
Got a whole graveyard of previous cases.
I'll bet you could do even better
if you had more cases to try.
- That's right.
- What are you getting at?
What kind of court of law is it?
Has no marshals.
I don't need no marshals to back me up.
There's Judge Parker,
Fort Smith, Arkansas...
- Has marshals.
- Right.
- A wealthy and respected man today.
- That he is.
Marshals have to be
men of strong moral fiber.
Country like this, overrun with outlaws...
Rich in possibilities.
I see no reason why the State of Texas...
through myself, could not provide...
half the booty and loot collected
as legal property of this court.
Split up four ways, I imagine.
- Five.
- Five.
Why, the State of Texas
would probably pay a bonus each month.
You mean, a bonus for the man
that does the most to the stopping...
of banditry and "outlawlessness"
that runs rampant in this land.
Providing I was able to find men of...
sufficient moral fiber.
Raise your right hands.
Do you solemnly swear
to uphold the letter of the law...
as stated in
The Revised Statutes of Texas, 1855?
And furthermore,
do you swear solemn allegiance...
and vow to uphold
the honor of Lillie Langtry?
- I do!
- Judge?
Can I be the bartender?
I've had my fill of being shot at for money.
What about that part about Miss Langtry?
That's the most beautiful woman
I ever seen in all my born days.
By the power vested in me...
through God and the great and honorable
State of Texas...
I hereby proclaim you
to be marshals of the court...
of the county of Greater Vinegarroon.
- For Texas and Miss Lillie!
- For Texas and Miss Lillie!
The whole thing was a mistake.
Why, I was framed from the start.
Set up by this two-bit vigilante judge
and his lynch mob.
They had nothing better to do.
Besides, I was easy to catch.
This here is Sam Dodd, Judge.
Genuine murderer.
- Who'd he kill?
- Chinaman and his greaser wife.
- Stole a fruit jar full of money.
- How much?
Close to $90.
$90?
That's a serious crime, son.
Where's the evidence?
We buried the victims
no more than an hour after he done it.
Get down off that horse!
I don't cotton to looking up
to the likes of you.
Hear ye! Hear ye!
Court of Vinegarroon is in session.
There'll be no drinking.
Judge Roy Bean presiding.
Do you have anything to say
before we find you guilty?
I'm not guilty of nothing.
There's no crime that I've done wrong.
Do you deny the killing?
I do not deny it.
But there's no place in that book where
it says nothing about killing a Chinese.
And no one I know
ever heard a law on greasers...
niggers, or Injuns.
All men stand equal before the law.
And I will hang a man for killing anyone,
including Chinks, greasers, or niggers!
I'm very advanced in my views
and outspoken.
But there's no place in that book that...
Trust in my judgment of the book.
Besides, you'll hang
no matter what it says...
'cause I am the law.
The law is the handmaiden of justice.
Get a rope.
Let's go, Sam Dodd.
I want to say something.
Don't I get to say nothing?
By all means.
I want to say that I still believe
this whole thing is a mistake...
and that I am no worse,
and probably better...
than the men
who are about to end my days.
Well spoken, son. That's enough.
It was wrong to do this to me
for the crimes mentioned...
but I'd also killed white men
and stole their horses.
So I figured that
that's what I was being hung for.
My only concern was that
that rope be tied properly...
and the whole thing done right.
It was.
Verily, it has come to pass
that the wicked, outlaws, et cetera...
are going to have their teeth
blunted like lions...
with their necks stretched and broken.
This is the fate of the wicked.
And all this has come to pass
'cause it is the duty of the righteous...
which is us,
to hang the wicked whenever we can.
So that a man can say truly...
that God has appointed a judge
upon the earth.
That is how it is
and the way it will be. Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Bar is open!
Two.
Two.
Two.
I'm Snake River Rufus Krile,
a long way from home.
Quit grinning.
Can't stand a man that grins.
I call that bet, and I'll raise you $10.
I'm blood kin to a Gila monster.
- Can drink my weight in wolf poison.
- One.
Massacre, bloodshed...
famine and drought
all put meat on my bones.
I'll see that and raise you $5.
Hardship and slaughter: my daily bread.
You in or out, Judge?
I'm considering...
I can whip a full-grown longhorn cow
with my hands tied.
Make violent love to mountain lions.
My trigger fingers are itchy.
I'm set to go, red hot.
Raise you $5.
Justifiable homicide.
I fine that man two bits
for firing a gun in a public building.
I also fine him...
$35, $45...
$52 for lying around.
Whorehouse, I call you and...
raise you $52.
I call.
Three bullets.
The marshals found
that the land abounded in opportunities.
And the pickings was easy.
Little did the varmints expect
the long arm of justice...
to reach them from within.
Criminal vermin was plentiful
and of good value, too.
We had us a table piled high with silver
in no time.
And that was just the beginning.
The confiscated property
of them that was caught and hung...
allowed the Judge
to institute civic improvements.
Wagonloads of real, law-abiding citizens
came to settle.
The Judge himself became a man
of considerable wealth and consequence.
He verily papered the courthouse walls...
with posters of his true and fair love.
He even sent riders to the railhead
to bring back the New York Times...
so he could follow the exploits
of Miss Langtry...
Jersey Lily,
voice as sweet as that of a nightingale.
I am...
disturbed by the news this morning.
What is it, Judge?
I am crestfallen.
Crestfallen?
Crestfallen by the...
report that Miss Lillie,
in a playful mood at a royal outing...
slipped a frog down the back
of His Highness Albert Edward...
Prince of Wales.
It was in a moment of frivolity,
you understand.
She slipped a frog
down this prince's neck?
Anyway, the Prince
was ruffled by the incident...
and disfavored Miss Lillie for it.
I suppose he would.
Suppose he would?
Ought to go over there
and hang the son of a bitch!
I would, too, except I got
too much respect for the royal family.
- Where'd you get that dress?
- You sent for it.
It sure didn't look like that
in the Sears and Roebuck catalog.
- Don't you like it?
- With all due respect to Miss Lillie...
I think she'd understand,
yeah, I like it a lot.
Just don't go wearing it around here
during drinking hours.
Sheriff! You better come quick!
There'll be an illegal lynching!
Hold it!
The only lynching around here
will be done according to the law.
Hell, Judge!
We got the tar and we got the feathers.
What is all this about, Bart?
We, as the decent folks of this community,
will not abide by pimp gamblers...
and women of the night
at prices like these.
- What's the going price?
- $5, that's the price!
- Gold or silver!
- Outrageous!
I'd be willing to make a special rate
for you, Judge...
- considering that...
- No, sir.
What goes for my town goes for me.
Justice goes for all.
Justice is the handmaiden of the law.
- I was only trying to make amends.
- Amends!
What you have done to these...
gentle damsels...
I accuse you, sir,
of leading them down the primrose path.
Making them slaves
to passion and the dollar.
$5.
- $3.
- $2.50.
For you, Judge, nothing.
Get those ladies down
from that traveling bordello...
and put them on the porch. You, sir.
Get out of my way.
That's it, come to me. I'll catch you.
I ain't going to sentence you, boy,
but I am going to warn you...
if you ain't out of here in five minutes,
I will open court.
- I haven't even got a horse.
- Steal one! A fast one!
Remember, we hang horse thieves
around here.
Spread out, ladies.
I didn't mean that.
What do you want
to do with them, Judge?
Just bear witness.
Bart, come here.
Fermel.
Right there. Right there.
Whorehouse, come here.
Right there.
- Tector.
- Yes, sir?
- Come on out here.
- No, not me, Judge. I'm a benedict.
What about me, Judge?
Over here.
Ladies...
I intend to steer you back
to the path of righteousness.
I hereby sentence you to one year...
under protective custody of my marshals.
Bar's open! Drinks are on the house!
I think, my dear...
that you are
a case for special consideration.
I hereby declare you a ward of the court.
A pig!
I likewise advise you to find a fast horse.
Hold it!
- All right, let's go inside.
- The Judge can handle it.
- Where you going?
- I am going for a walk.
Smell how sweet that air is.
It's almost tropical, that's what it is.
In the desert at night,
in the moonlight, it smells like...
it could be a teeming jungle...
in Africa or India or the like.
And it makes me dream about this land.
What I'm going to make of it.
Someday it's going to be covered...
with farms and towns.
There's going to be a railroad.
Streets...
covered with brick.
Buildings made of stone, 100 feet high.
There will be factories
and slaughterhouses...
like I seen in those pictures
of Denver and Chicago.
And I am going to have a courthouse
made of granite, four stories high...
so I can look down
and see that everything is going to plan.
And you can have anything you want.
You just think of anything you want.
A box that makes songs.
What?
A box that you open, it makes songs.
- Music box.
- Sí.
I would get you a pipe organ.
- What songs would you want it to play?
- Any songs.
You ever hear the Yellow Rose of Texas?
No, why?
You should have.
How does it go?
Sing more.
No, I can't sing.
It's cold in that shack where you live,
ain't it?
It's all right in the summer.
Yeah, but it's cold in the winter
and it leaks in the rain, don't it?
Sometimes.
And the wind comes through.
Only when it's blowing.
Yeah, it is summer and the sky is clear,
there's no wind.
You should spend the night
in the courthouse so I can protect you...
from the elements.
What are you doing there
in the middle of nowhere, digging a hole?
A grave.
When that wheel come off the wagon,
I took it for a sign.
- This here's my dying ground.
- Where you coming from?
Lived in the mountains mostly.
I was a mountain man.
Knew Jim Bridger, Kit Carson,
Liver Eatin' Johnson.
He was a good feller when he started.
But things get to him.
Went bad after a few winters.
Yeah, a man will do that.
What's your name, mister?
I'm Grizzly Adams,
direct descendant of John Quincy Adams...
sixth President of the United States.
His blood is in me.
I went wild as a youth,
ran away to the mountains.
Good life, free life, but cold.
So cold I'd go to the bears,
lie with them in their cave.
That's why I'm known as Grizzly.
I cohabitated with the bears.
What are you doing in Vinegarroon?
All my life, I've been cold.
- I come south to die where it's warm.
- It's warm here.
There'll be no illegal dying.
The only people that die in my town
are those that I shoot or hang.
Get along with you.
Can't die here! Can't die there! Man
can't even die where he sees fit no more!
I want no part
of what this world's come to.
I'm glad my days are at an end.
That's Zachary Taylor, my oldest boy...
named after the 12th President
of the United States.
I prefer his company to that of men.
Pick up that wheel and move on.
Or I'll have you both strung up
for disturbing the peace.
Hurry up, mister,
this bear ain't getting any lighter.
How about adopting him, mister?
He'll need someone after I'm gone
to love and be loved by in return.
Send him back to his mother.
She run off with another bear
from Colorado.
What do you think you're doing?
Come on back here and pick up your bear!
- Good heavens.
- Give Zach a good home, mister.
Or sure as hell,
I'll come back and haunt you.
There now. Good bear.
Go on, run for it. You can't bluff me.
- Go on back to your father!
- Run, Judge!
Okay, stay where you are, damn it!
- Come on, Judge, he's a monster!
- Nasty bear. You want to make friends?
Go on!
Get in there now. Go on.
Go to bed and lie down, you hear me?
I don't know which one he was talking to.
But either way
it must've been one hell of a night.
The Watch Bear
moved right into the household.
The Judge and him and Marie Elena
were inseparable.
The three of them
used to go picnicking together.
Dearest Lillie:
It was with fondest enthusiasm
that I received your letter this morning.
It was delivered to me while in court.
I dared not open it...
for fear that it would cause
me to reel in dazed ecstasy...
and forget the grave responsibilities
of my position.
We're ready, Judge.
Therefore I placed it
in a pocket over my heart...
where it has remained warm until now.
I don't want to hurry you,
but the horse is getting nervous.
Quiet, you damn fool.
Can't you see the Judge is reading a letter
from Miss Langtry? Come on.
Dear Mr. Bean: On behalf of Miss Langtry...
I wish to thank you
for your correspondence...
of April, March, February,
and January, 1895.
Miss Langtry is presently engaged
in a tour of the Continent...
and will make every effort to review it
at her soonest possible convenience.
Most warmly yours, Dorothy P. Pilsbury...
personal secretary to Miss Lillie Langtry.
Any last words?
- We already said that.
- All right, give me back my cigar.
Carry out the sentence.
