ANNOUNCER:
That's a green limb, you fool.
What do you want to do?
Put out my fire 'fore
I get it started?
'Tain't neither green.
It's dry as a bone.
You sass your pa once more,
I'll take a strap to you.
Now you get over to the wagon
and get them wet sacks.
I don't want no fire
around that wagon.
Look at it go now.
Wind's just right.
It'll be up
in them trees in no time.
Oh, how far'll it burn?
Oh, on up through the canyon.
Up that ridge, I expect.
Make a nice piece of land.
That's a lot of trees'll burn.
Can't eat trees.
Well, the stock can eat grass,
and the grass'll burn, too.
Grass'll grow back in,
thicker and richer than ever.
Fire purifies the land.
Always like to burn over
my land before I start.
Somebody's coming.
I can hear as good as you can.
Who are you, and what in tarn
are you doing with that fire?
I'm Jeb Hoad.
This is my daughter, Willow.
I'm clearing myself
a piece of land.
I might settle down here,
if'n I like the look of it bare.
Why, you crazy fool, you're
gonna burn the whole range.
Give me that sack.
Get some more of these
sacks and help me.
Let that fire alone!
You'll get yourself killed!
Shoot him, Pa!
Shoot him good!
Now look, you-- you try
reloading that cannon,
I'll put
a hole right through you.
You killed my pa!
I'm sorry.
I got to get this fire put out.
Still like to cut
my heart out, wouldn't you?
I just don't know
what I'm going to do with you.
Look, if you'd just
listen to reason.
Just give me a chance.
Let me try to explain.
Your father didn't
know what he was doing.
There's a lot of people
living up in these hills.
People with homes.
People with families.
These woods
are as dry as tinder.
Once the wind
got behind that fire
he wouldn't have
burned 1,000 acres
he'd have burned 20,000,
maybe more.
All right.
All right, I...
I know it's not a reason
to kill a man for.
I didn't want it to happen.
I didn't want it
to come to that.
Look, you have
to listen to me.
I... I warned him
not to shoot, didn't I?
Didn't I warn him
not to try it again?
It's not too good a time
to explain, I guess.
I can't leave you
out here alone.
I'll take you back to the house,
see if I can't help you.
Come on.
Let's go.
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you dead!
I'll kill you!
Come on.
Come and get me.
Come on!
Just wait till
my kinfolks get here.
They're a-coming!
They'll get you!
They'll kill your family!
They'll burn
your place down, too.
Grandma Hoad can do it.
She'll make you
wish you never was born!
Wait and see!
WILLOW: Tarnation
yellow-back!
Let me off of here!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you,
sure as you're born!
In heaven's name,
what have you got here?
Her name's Willow.
I killed her father.
You
WILLOW: Yellow-back!
Let me off of here!
Clearing the timber
off of Box Creek Canyon.
They were going to burn it off.
Burn it off?
That's right.
A fire in the canyon would...
would turn it into a chimney.
Half the Ponderosa
could have been...
I told him to put it out.
He wouldn't do it.
I tried to put
the fire out myself.
He warned me if I went near it,
he'd kill me.
I didn't think
he meant it, but he did.
I had to kill him
to stay alive.
WILLOW:
You can't keep me here.
My kinfolks are coming.
They'll kill you all.
Grandma Hoad'll feed
you to the hogs.
What about her?
After I killed her father,
she came at me.
I... I had to tie her up.
There was nothing else
I could do.
Hoss...
have the body
decently laid out.
Adam, you better go and report
this to the sheriff.
See if he can
get out here, if possible.
Ask Mrs. Shaughnessy
to drop up here.
We'll need some help.
Oh, and Adam,
you better have her
bring some things for the girl--
shoes, a dress,
maybe a skirt or two.
You better put the girl
in the east bedroom.
WILLOW:
They'll kill you all!
You can't keep me here!
My kinfolks are coming!
They'll kill you all!
Grandma Hoad'll
will feed you to the hogs!
You boys want to see
some first-class stock?
Look yonder.
Whoa.
What do you make
of it, Dodie?
Only see one gun.
Mind what I told you.
You hear?
I heard ya.
Git up.
Whoa.
Howdy, stranger.
Afternoon, ma'am.
We be the Hoads,
traveling west out of Kentucky.
We want no trouble
with man or beast.
I'm Bart Hastings.
This is the Lazy K.
These are my men.
Like you,
I don't want any trouble.
You're welcome to
travel across my land.
Now, that's real nice of you.
Know of a place
called Virginia City?
Know it well.
How far be it?
Oh, about a week's travel
with your rig.
WOMAN: Ever seen the likes
of us before?
Why do you ask?
A son of mine, Jeb Hoad,
and his young'un
likely passed through here
some time ago.
You'd know him for our kin
if'n you'd seen him.
Passed through here
about a week, ten days ago.
You didn't take to him?
I did not.
Don't take to folks like us?
He camped here without asking.
Killed one of my steers
for beef.
Didn't ask about that, either.
We'uns ain't liked much.
Hang tight together.
Got to, or get killed.
Nobody does a hurt to a Hoad
without'n he pays for it.
I didn't hurt him.
What's more,
I gave him the beef.
He and the youngster looked
half-starved.
Then I ordered him off my land.
That why you ain't asking
me and mine
to light here
and rest ourselves?
Account of that steer?
That's right.
We traveled a far piece today.
Near 20 mile.
We'uns are wore thin.
Stock needs feed, needs water.
You can't stay here,
and that's an order!
- You got to move on!
-
I wasn't...
I wasn't going to shoot.
I was just... I was only...
He's dead.
He's dead.
W-We killed another one.
Come on, bring him
out of there
before that horse tramples him.
He's dead.
Ever know Dodie to miss?
Come on, bring him
out of there!
Give him a hand.
You won't get away with this.
Nothing to get away from.
It was murder.
That man drawed his gun.
It don't do to draw on a Hoad.
Too many of us
have been killed.
You know it was murder.
I saw you beat the man for it.
'Twasn't murder
I whupped him about.
I whupped Dodie 'cause he shot
'thout I told him to.
I'd warned him when we got here.
Call it murder or not,
he'll hang for it!
I'll see to that!
Best think on that real hard.
You ain't never seen killin'
till you kill one of us.
Is she that dirty?
Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna have
to soak her a good long while
to get her clean, Pa.
Well, how you gonna manage that?
Hoss has got this contraption
rigged up.
He thinks it's gonna work.
Sure hope it does.
Yeah, hope it does.
Yeah.
There. I think this ought
to just about do it.
WILLOW:
Let me out of here! Let me out!
- Here, take this
out of here. -Yeah.
- Good mirrors are hard
to come by. -Right.
WILLOW:
Open this door!
- Let me out!
-
I'll pound this room to pieces!
Let me out of here!
Oh! Hey, Shaughnessy,
maybe we better
just put it off for a while.
You know, maybe I could
talk to her.
- Calm her down a little bit.
- We've waited long enough.
Now there's no use in
putting it off any longer.
- Let me out of here!
- All right, but now look,
you promise me you're
not gonna hurt her?
And if she starts to fight
a little bit too much,
- we'll just let her go.
-
I promised,
and I'll keep my promise.
And don't forget, she might
be afraid of water, you know.
Oh, nonsense. That's just
another excuse to fight.
She'd fight if you
fed her cherry pie.
Now, if I had my say,
I'd take that snap and bite out
of her with a razor strap.
Shaughnessy, please,
open this door!
Well, Shaughnessy,
take it from me,
it doesn't do any good
to fight with her.
- Let me out!
- If we use a little patience
and a little kindness,
we, we can...
Don't worry, Little Joe,
I'll do it your way.
- Now, here, take this.
- Okay.
WILLOW:
Let me out of here!
Well... there she is.
She's a good one, too. Stout.
I jumped up and down on it.
What is it?
Well...
It'll work fine, if I need it.
Now you two get out
of here. Go on.
Yes'm.
WILLOW: Let me out of here!
Let me out!
Ooh, I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
Tarnation yellow-back!
- Let me off of here!
- I don't know, Hoss.
- I'll kill you!
- I don't think it's gonna work.
- Don't you fret yourself.
-
Shaughnessy has run more
critters through that sheep dip
than half the ranchers
in Nevada.
-
- WILLOW: I'm not gonna!
You can't make me
get in that water!
I won't! I won't!
Get your hands off of me!
Give me back my britches!
I'll show you!
No! You tryin' to drown me?!
Joe, what do you
think you're doing?
You can't go in there.
WILLOW:
Ooh-ooh-ooh!
-
- No! No!
Hey... you don't...
you don't reckon...?
I don't know.
May-Maybe she did drown her.
- Can't you hear nothing?
- Shh.
Miss Shaughnessy?
Sh-Shaughnessy, are you all
right?! Answer me!
LITTLE JOE:
Shaughnessy, are you all right!
Answer me!
-
- We're all right!
Fact is, we're fine.
We're having a real nice soak.
Oh, I can't do this.
I'm all thumbs.
You're the one that says
it takes gentleness
and patience.
Well, stay there and be gentle
and patient.
Be careful she doesn't bite
a finger off ya.
Yeah.
Here it is, Shaughnessy.
I-I moved that buckle over about
a midge.
It ought to fit real fine now.
Try it and see.
Me?
We might need someone strong.
Yes'm.
Easy, gal.
Real easy, now.
Ain't you kick me.
Easy now. That's the way.
They won't hurt.
Hey, you know something, Joe?
Hmm?
She  a pretty little gal.
Pretty as a spotted pony.
LITTLE JOE:
Ooh!
What's the matter now?
She bit me, that's what's
the matter.
It can't hurt that bad.
She took the hide off me!
Took the hide right off me!
Well, you pulled her hair
or something.
Never was any good
at hair, no how.
Who does all the plaiting
of the tails
and manes around here? Me.
You better be careful.
Don't you bite me.
I-I'll swat you one.
Hey, Hoss, will you hurry
up with that thing?
Come on, hurry.
She's hard to hold.
I'm coming!
Here, what do you want me
to do with it?
Put it where she
can see herself,
and then I'll let her go.
Uh, over by the window, Hoss,
where the light's the best.
Yes'm.
Now, watch her.
You-you watch her, now.
I'm gonna let her go.
HOSS:
Easy, gal.
Easy. That's it.
HOSS:
Hey...
Hey... hey, Joe,
you know something?
You know something, I...
I think you was right.
Yeah, she's a gal, ain't she?
Any gal would rather
look pretty than not.
I knew she'd quiet down
the minute she saw herself.
All females are vain.
Can I show the mister?
Hey, you sure can. He's gonna be
real surprised, too.
He didn't know he had such a
good-looking gal in the house.
Hey, Pa?!
Hey, Pa, I got
a surprise for you!
Where are you?
I'll check the barn, Joe.
Yeah.
Hey, come on.
Let's sit...
Oh, right here.
Sit down.
Put your hands there.
No, I don't like it.
Come here.
Put your hand up here.
Put your hand...
There.
Yeah.
Hmm! That's good.
Ah, you stay like that.
I want Pa to see you
just like that, okay? Just...
Hey, Pa!
Pa?
Hey, Pa. Pa!
What's all the yelling about?
Pa, I got something to show you.
- It's a surprise.
- What?
You're not... you're not
gonna believe it.
Believe what?
So help me, Pa,
I'm gonna bring her back
and tame her,
if it's the last thing I do.
Hey, Joe, did you tell her
she could take Pa's horse?
horse?
Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy.
HOSS:
I'll be dad-burn.
A book of poetry.
Hard to believe, ain't it?
I never figured a book of poetry
was good for anything.
Yeah, that book of poetry
turned the bullet
and saved my life.
Yeah. Hey, there's some
pages here that ain't torn.
- Mind if I read it?
- No, go ahead.
Who is it?
It's the sheriff.
Pa's down there
talking to him.
I wonder how he found out
I was bushwhacked so fast.
I don't know.
I'll go find out.
Well, Ben, this is
the first I heard
that Adam had been shot.
But in view of what I
was gonna talk to you about,
I think I know who shot him.
Who? Adam's never had
any enemies around here.
He has now. You all have.
You got
a whole durn nest of them.
What do you mean?
Well, that girl Adam said
you had here--
her kinfolk, the Hoads,
they come to town,
just like she said they would.
Now you... you don't
mean that, uh...
it was one of her family
that shot Adam?
Well, Ben, like you say,
Adam  have any enemies
that would do a thing like that.
But the Hoads did find out
it was a Cartwright
killed the girl's father.
No question about that.
The talk's all over town.
So somebody must have
pointed Adam out
when he went through
Virginia City.
You still got that girl here?
Yeah, yeah, she's-she's
still here, Roy.
She's out with
Little Joe somewhere,
but she's still here.
You mean she's roaming
around loose?
From what Adam said
you just about
had to keep her locked up
in a cage.
Oh, she's tamed down now, Roy.
She's, uh, wearing a dress
and washing
and eating
at the table with us,
even learning how to embroider.
We still have to keep
her locked up at night.
Yeah, and the guns locked up
and anything with an edge on it,
like a, like a knife
or an ax or something.
Even so, she sounds a lot tamer
than the rest of her family.
That's what I wanted
to tell you, Ben.
The Hoads killed one
of Bart Hastings' best men
on the Lazy K when they come
through there.
Killed him or murdered him?
Well, it all depends
on who you're listening to.
Bart claims it was
out-and-out murder,
and the Hoads, they say
it was just plain self-defense.
Anyway, there's got
to be a trial.
I'm on my way over now
to pick up Dodie Hoad,
the one that done the shooting.
Thought you and Hoss
should come along.
It's on your property.
Well... the Hoads camped
near here?
Just over the ridge.
We'll come along.
I'll saddle up the horses, Pa.
I'll be right out.
They'll come.
Don't you fret
yourself about that.
They killed my boy Jeb
because he wanted
to settle on a piece of land.
They'll come to drive
we'uns off, too.
Have we got to kill them, Gram?
Got to kill the one that
killed my boy, Jeb, leastwise.
Got to show them we can kill
man for man.
It's the onliest way
we can stay alive.
I wish it wasn't so.
Has to be, Bud.
Folks like them
been hounding us
every foot of the way
from St. Joe.
Fighting us.
Denying us the simple
means of living.
Killing us.
'Twasn't for us showing them
we could kill quicker,
quicker than they could,
we'd be in our
graves before this.
That's true, Gram,
they do hound us.
I never could figure
out just why.
We'uns ain't like them.
That's why.
They don't take to
folks who are different.
They hate 'em, fear 'em.
Just feel they got
to be rid of them.
Well, I don't see that.
We're like they are.
No, we ain't.
Our folks settled in Kentucky
and Tennessee
more than a hundred year ago,
but we ain't like 'em.
We got two hands, two feet,
we got red blood in our bodies.
We got love in our hearts for
our young'uns and our old'uns.
And we pray to God Almighty,
but we ain't like 'em.
We'll be fighting 'em all the
rest of our lives, I expect.
Our lives may not be long.
They can kill us off near
anytime they take a notion.
Can't give in to 'em--
that's the worst.
Can't let 'em fence us out or
deny us our rights to the land
or kill us without punishment.
We'uns would be better dead many
times over if we done that.
Well, I'd rather be alive
and married to Willow,
like we was promised.
I'd rather have
a piece of land
and a place
to raise young'uns.
I'm a-feared they ain't never
gonna let you and Willow marry.
They're a-gathering
again' us right now.
You know that.
I reckon.
They'll come on hard, and I
reckon they won't stop
till we're all dead.
I know  won't.
If it comforts you
they'll bury twice as many
of theirs as they will ours.
I promise you that.
It don't comfort.
Not none at all.
I hear riders.
-
- Far enough!
Roy.
Ma'am, I'm the law.
Not here, you ain't.
Here, I'm the law.
Don't be a fool, Mrs. Hoad.
I come out for the
one you call Dodie.
What do you want with him?
Stand trial for the killing
of Slim Carter
of the Lazy K Ranch.
That'un drawed his gun.
Dodie killed him 'fore
he could kill one of us.
That ain't nothing to stand
trial about.
It's up to the jury to decide
whether he's guilty or not.
My job is just to take him in as
the law requires.
Where was the law
when they killed Dodie's wife?
Dodie's wife?
I know nothing about
a woman being killed.
I'm telling you.
Near a month ago
out in the prairie
some wild bunch came and shot up
our wagon for no reason.
Dodie's wife didn't draw a gun,
but they killed her.
Dodie ain't been real right in
the head ever since.
Did you report that
killing to the law?
I told a lawman.
He done nothing.
Just drove us on.
There's a law for you'uns
and a law for we'uns.
But it ain't the same law.
- Now, look...
- Ma'am...
It is the same.
Least ways, around here, it is.
Who might you be?
Ben Cartwright.
I own this land.
Then you must know who I am,
I reckon.
You better know why I'm here.
Yeah, I know.
Your granddaughter,
Willow, told us all about you.
I want her.
But more than that I want
the man that killed Jeb Hoad.
I heard about that, too, ma'am.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Little Joe said
it was unavoidable.
I mean to see
he hangs for it.
Little Joe's my son.
And Jeb Hoad was mine.
The law determined
that Little Joe acted
in self-defense.
There's a law for you'uns
and a law for we'uns,
and it's not the same law.
I say it is the same law
for both of us.
And don't you defy it.
Now, I come out here to take in
Dodie Hoad,
and I'm going to take him.
You try it, and they'll
likely bury all of us.
- Is that right?!
- Roy. -
Maybe, we, uh... maybe we better
think on this, huh?
Yeah, maybe so.
Come on, boys.
Roy?
Yeah?
You know, she meant what
she said, every word of it.
If we try
to bull our way in there
there'll be dead to bury--
most of theirs and most of us.
But I've got to go in.
She's defying the law.
Well, she's not defying it,
she's afraid of it.
What's the difference
whether she's afraid
of it or not?
The law's the law,
and I've sworn to uphold it.
Well, maybe you didn't swear it
when you took office,
but you're bound to uphold human
lives before the law.
Ben, you've got
to be realistic.
Them Hoads are like a pit
full of rattlesnakes,
and twice as dangerous.
You heard her say she wanted
to hang Little Joe, didn't you?
Well, she meant
every word of that.
She was upset.
And she had every right to be.
I know how I'd feel
if one of my sons
had just been killed.
Now, Roy, you got to let me
go back and reason with her.
All right, Ben.
Pa, what you going to do?
I'm going to hold out
my hand to her.
I got a bead on him, Ma.
Just say when.
Far enough.
Stand there.
What tricks are you playing?
No tricks.
I'm a man with sons,
tired of killing.
I've come to talk to a woman
with sons who must hate killing.
Will you hear me?
I'll hear you.
We can fight each other
and kill each other
over a man already dead.
And that'd pile grief on grief
and settle nothing.
Or we can call
the dead man buried.
We can set aside grief and hate.
We could live as neighbors.
Will you look at what
I've come to show you?
I'll look.
Not more than
a rich valley with sweet
water and good grass.
Sheltered land.
I'll give you 50 head of beef
and ten horses, two
broken to the plow.
Your neighbors--
and I'll be one of them--
will help you build
before the snow flies.
It has the look of
a lie, a trap.
Yeah, that it does.
But the truth would look
exactly the same.
No man gives away so much.
I'm not giving.
I'm trading.
In exchange,
you won't make me kill
some of yours to protect mine,
and I won't make you kill
some of mine to protect yours.
What about my boy Dodie?
Sheriff said he wanted him.
Yeah.
He'll have to stand trial.
A fair trial, I promise you.
Show me your face.
I ain't seen nothing
but lying, cheating men
for a long, long time.
I'm about decided
all the good'uns are dead.
What did you see?
I'll study on it.
Dodie will come in
at sundown tomorrow... or not.
That'll be your answer.
Sundown tomorrow.
If'n this be a trap--
a trick to blind me,
or some way to kill Dodie--
I'll come after you,
Ben Cartwright.
And I won't rest till you're in
your grave or I'm in mine.
And I mean to have my
granddaughter back with me.
You remember that.
Oh...
You can't keep me, now.
My kin's here.
I can go if I want.
I got my rights.
Let go of me!
I don't want to keep
you here, Willow.
I just came out to say
good-bye to you, that's all.
This pony and your clothes--
all the clothes you got
back in your room--
they're yours to keep.
Make sure you come
back and get them.
Come back and visit us real
soon, too, now, you hear?
What happened?
She run off again?
Yeah, she left.
You, uh, really thought
you could tame her, huh?
No, it wasn't that.
She heard us talking.
Heard her family was nearby,
and she wanted to be with them,
so I let her go.
Well, now that's probably the
best thing, don't you think?
I suppose.
But you'll miss her, huh?
Yeah, I guess I will.
She was kind of cute when we got
her face washed, you know?
I guess I kind of
got used to having her around.
Something else on your mind?
Yeah.
Yeah, I promised Willow
I'd tell her kin
how I come to kill her father.
I still have that to do.
I think you ought to let Pa and
the sheriff take care of that.
I'm the one that killed him.
I'm the one
that should tell them.
Well, look, Joe, you can't take
a chance like that.
I wouldn't go near that place
without some help.
It wouldn't mean anything
if I went in there with an army.
Could mean you'd stay alive.
Ah...
Adam, I don't think the Hoads
are a tribe of killers.
Besides, we don't even know
it was one of them
that bushwhacked you.
And I promised Willow
I'd tell 'em face-to-face.
I killed her father, Adam.
I think it's the least I can do.
No, now Joe, you can't.
Now listen to me...
Joe, Joe, come back...!
It's Willow! She's come back!
You let me handle this, boy.
Well, I see you
got away from 'em, girl.
They didn't even try
and stop me.
They just let me go.
Like as not 'cause they knew
I'd come after
'em if they didn't.
You all right?
They didn't hurt you none,
did they?
Oh, they didn't hurt me none.
They give me these clothes,
though, and a lot
of pretty things.
Gram, it was nice there.
The house was big,
real splendid like.
And they got a looking glass
most tall as me.
I'd like to see
something like that.
Not for us. None of that stuff.
This shirt you got on--
a hussy shirt.
Get shed of it, hear?
Oh, I think it's real pretty,
Willow.
You look so different.
I ain't different, Bud.
Not inside, I ain't.
Gram, they was good to me.
Well, they even asked me to come
back and visit anytime at all.
Don't forget, they's the ones
that killed your pa.
And don't you fret, girl.
We're gonna kill the one
that done it.
Now, who do you reckon
this might be?
Ain't never seen him
before, Dodie.
Little feller, kind of pretty.
Heard it was a pretty little
feller that killed Jeb.
Yeah, but you don't
know this one's him.
Yeah, I do.
Got a feeling in my bones.
Remember what Ma told ya.
Ma ain't here now.
She's back talking to Willow.
Feels like it's up to me
to figure out what to do.
What's that gonna be?
Y'all just wait here and
watch. You'll see.
Gonna have me some fun
killing a pretty little feller
that killed my brother.
Looking for somebody, stranger?
Yeah, looking for a
family named Hoad.
Reckon you found 'em.
Is there a woman here
named Grandma Hoad?
She's busy. I'm Dodie Hoad,
you can talk to me.
No, I think I'd
rather talk to her.
Can't. You got something to say,
say it to me.
Yeah, well,
I don't think I will.
It looks to me like you
want trouble and I don't.
Well, now you come this far, it
wouldn't be neighborly I let you
go away without you spoke
your piece, would it?
Well, I'll be back when I can
talk to the right person.
Oh, don't be in
a hurry, neighbor.
Maybe I can help you.
You come here looking for
the man that shot your brother,
ain't that right?
Well, you found him. I shot him.
Now you'd like to shoot me, huh?
You shot my brother Jeb.
Ain't you got a shooting
coming to you?
Your brother Jeb tried
to shoot me in the back.
He missed, and I warned him
not to try it again.
He did, and I had to kill him.
There was nothing else
I could have done.
Yeah, I figured it was you.
I felt it in my bones.
Now, I'm gonna get on my horse
and I'm gonna ride out of here.
And like I said,
I don't want any trouble.
Don't try it.
You raise that gun,
I'm gonna have to kill ya.
Now, hold it!
'Twas a trick.
'Twas a trick, after all.
A trick so's you could sneak in
and kill Dodie.
You a fast gun, a killer.
I didn't come here to kill him.
But he was bound he'd kill me.
I warned him,
but he had to try it.
All right,
now I'm warning all of you.
I'm going out of here now.
I don't want anybody
to make a move.
I'll come after you. Never fear.
You can't go far enough away!
You'll die for this!
And your pappy will die
for the trick he played me!
What kind of men are you?
That man killed your brother,
and yonder he goes riding free.
What are you standing there
staring for?
Have you water in your veins?
Have you rope for spines?
Take your rifles now
and go, do you hear?
I want him dead
and his father dead.
Go now.
Go now, do you hear?!
What do you mean by that?
We're done with killing!
Done with killing?
Dodie was bound
to murder that boy, Ma.
He'd have shot him
in the back if need be.
The boy could have done no less
than what he done and live.
You cowards.
You sniveling...!
That man killed
your brother Dodie!
He killed your brother Jeb!
- He murdered them.
-
Don't that mean nothing to you?
It weren't neither murder, Gram!
They's right! Pa tried
to shoot him in the back!
He tried twice!
It's like John's telling you.
We killed enough!
I want that boy dead.
I want him dead now.
I never would have knowed you.
That's how much
you changed, Willow.
The only thing is,
I-I keep thinking you
changed toward me.
I've been living for the day
that we'd... we'd catch up
to you and we could be married,
like we's promised.
Now I'm afraid.
There never was
another man for me, Bud,
and there never will be,
not as long as we live.
I told Gram Hoad that
I didn't think we'd ever
live long enough to get married.
I guess I got no reason
to change that now.
We done all we could,
you and me and John and Pa.
We talked ourselves clear tired.
Maybe she heared us. Maybe not.
But if'n she says we got
to fight them, we got to.
We got to do what she says.
You know that.
Make yourselves ready.
We're a-goin' now.
We're a-gonna see the man
that killed my sons.
Reckon you know Dodie won't be
giving hisself up
sundown tomorrow.
Yes, I know.
Boy there killed him.
BEN:
I know.
Killed Jeb,
killed Dodie the same way.
He's real fast with a gun.
My son doesn't enjoy killing.
He had no choice.
Two of my sons
killed the same way
by the same man.
Willow saw the first killing,
John and Paul, the second.
They say it was done
the same way.
It ain't easy
seeing two sons killed.
Willow says her pa was gonna
shoot you in the back.
John and Paul say Dodie
tried to do the same thing.
I believe them.
They ain't never lied to me.
I believe you done what
any man would have done.
You had to kill 'em.
Reckon I can't
hold no anger again' you.
Willow says you'uns got all
kinds of fixings in your house.
Mind if'n I step in to see?
My house is your house.
You're welcome at all times.
