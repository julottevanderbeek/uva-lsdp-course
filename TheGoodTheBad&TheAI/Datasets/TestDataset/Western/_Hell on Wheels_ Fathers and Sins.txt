Previously on AMC's Hell On Wheels...
You owe me a life
for the one you took from me today.
Every one and every thing
that travels by railroad
east, west, north, south,
will pass through here.
And stay at my hotel.
You reach Cheyenne in 20 days
on time and on budget and I will convince
Congress to reinstate you permanently.
Aah!
John...
Ezra, stop.
Listen.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Don't run away like that.
Ezra!
A knife doesn't scare me,
young man.
- Hold still.
-
Ain't nothin' wrong with that
boy a good whuppin' won't fix.
Yeah.
Think we'll start
with a haircut first.
Mm-hmm.
Let's get to it.
Yeah.
A woman like that good
with scissors and a Bible?
You ought to marry her up,
Mr. Bohannon,
before Miss Ruth find her
some other lowlife
fancy belt-wearing huckster
that come along.
You callin' me a fancy lowlife
belt-wearing huckster, Psalms?
Uh, no sir, Mr. Bohannon.
All anybody needs to be
concerned with today
is making Cheyenne by tomorrow.
Yes, sir, Mr. Bohannon.
All right, y'all, listen up!
That there dot on the horizon
is Cheyenne!
I promised General Grant
hisself...
that we'd make it there
by tomorrow at sunset.
It gives us two days
to lay 5 mile of track.
Mr. Bohannon,
speaking for the Irish,
all due respect, sir,
but tomorrow's Sunday.
It's the lord's day,
not a work day.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- That's right.
Even the lord makes
exceptions, Mr. Quinn.
And sacrifices.
In fact, the only thing
he don't make
is the extra money
I'm gonna put in your pockets
you get us to Cheyenne
on schedule.
Yeah, that's true.
This right here...
is the rest of my stock.
I'm cashing it in.
Spreading it around.
Who wants a piece?
All: Yeah.
- I want a piece.
Well, I suppose it's no sin
to work on the lord's day.
Long as we don't
make a habit of it.
And my crew
will take a piece of that.
Work be our ticket to heaven.
We'll ride this train
and that stock
all the way to Cheyenne.
We've been through
hell and back.
Indians, rain, drought...
cholera.
You men have done
a hell of a job.
I'm proud of all of y'all.
Now...
you get us to Cheyenne
by tomorrow night,
first two rounds is on me!
All: Yeah.
Whores are on Dutch.
All: Yeah!
Get to work!
Good God, he's going to do it.
Who is?
Bohannon!
He's right there.
Tomorrow, he'll be right here,
laying tracks in my town.
Pennies on my eyes.
Our town.
You keep leaving that
rather important part out.
Hmm. How did you sleep
last night, Mr. Durant?
Those goose down mattresses,
they cost a fortune.
What?
You sell cattle to Bohannon.
You lend me money
to build  town.
You build a hotel
on the best lot in Cheyenne
and charge me
full fare to rent a room.
Now, if I didn't know better,
I might think you were playing
both ends against the middle,
Mrs. Palmer.
Hmm.
Thank you, Abigail.
Often, your interests
align with mine.
Occasionally, they don't.
Your interests
align with mine?
I think you got it backwards.
Mmm.
Quail?
Dove.
The French call it detente.
It's what you and Bohannon
better reach
before he reaches Cheyenne.
Make peace with Bohannon?
To what end?
You promised me
Cheyenne would be
the most important
railroad city in America.
How are you
going to accomplish that
without the cooperation
of the railroad?
You are an exasperating woman,
Mrs. Palmer.
Why? Because I talk like
a blunt-talkin' man?
Send Bohannon a telegram.
Invite him to lunch.
Today.
Work it out.
Nothing is that easy
with Bohannon.
I am not sure he's the problem.
That's him.
Lot of guns down there.
All the guns in the world
will not protect
Cullen Bohannon.
Ruth.
Ruth.
Mr. Bohannon.
This just came for you.
She wrote this down right?
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Luke.
Ruth.
Where's Ruth at?
Hey, she gave you a haircut.
Looks good.
Ruth?
I've kept you out of your bed
long enough, Mr. Bohannon.
I'll be on the noon train
to Omaha.
There's an orphanage
in Council Bluffs.
- I can take Ezra--
- Ruth...
stop it.
I'm sorry, but if a tenant
of Christ's teachings
is selflessness, then I have
been a poor disciple.
Sean McGinnis
was a troubled soul.
His brother relieved him
of his troubles.
Now, that weren't
through no fault of yours.
Sean came to me
to unburden himself.
He came seeking solace.
And...
and I denied him.
Perhaps I would do well
to spend some time
away from this place.
The men need you here, Ruth.
I have made no difference
in their lives.
Well, you've given me comfort.
And you've given me hell too.
In equal parts,
according to what I deserve.
And I ain't the only one.
Do you want me to stay,
Mr. Bohannon?
Hell on wheels just needs
a good preacher, Ruth.
And you are.
You are a good preacher.
Tomorrow's Sunday.
The men expect
to get preached to.
They expect you
to do the preaching.
That's all there is to it.
Come on, boy.
Get your hat.
We're going to Cheyenne.
You have a seat.
You stay right there too.
- Mickey.
- You're just in time.
Chief of police over there
is full as a gypsy's bra,
and I'm almost positive
that Wallace
is dealing
off the bottom of the deck.
Thank you.
Take two.
Take your damn scalp and get
the hell out of here.
- Oh, you can leave that.
- That's my money.
Not anymore, it ain't.
Um...
You best give me that.
It cost me $1.
Agh!
Thanks for the warning.
Ugh!
You know what that is?
That's a telegram.
From Durant.
Asking me to come to Cheyenne.
What for?
If I didn't know better,
I'd say he's surrendering.
He knows we're gonna be
in Cheyenne tomorrow
and wants to broker a deal.
Know what that means?
Hey.
We won the damn war, damn it.
Ain't none of us out here
never won nothin'.
And never will.
Otherwise, we wouldn't
be here in the first place.
Quit your damn bitchin'.
You're comin' to Cheyenne.
Let's go.
Well, what you need me for?
Victory needs an audience,
and you is he.
Come on, my friend.
Where my money at?
Put your hat on.
You might find it.
Uh-uh.
Come on.
I was wondering
when you'd come.
Forgive me.
If you're praying,
I can come back.
How will you tell it?
"Cain and Abel"?
"Fallen woman pastor
brings murder into her church"?
Is that how you see yourself...
a fallen woman pastor?
This doesn't have to be
about the newspaper.
Do you ever wonder how we came
to be in this forsaken place?
Well...
if I believed in God,
which...I don't...
I would say it's for my sins.
I have just enough faith
to condemn me
for the sins I've committed
since I arrived here.
What sins?
I've been praying
for understanding.
I-it isn't...
a sin to pray
for understanding, is it?
Oh, we can't know God's will.
So...
where does that leave you?
Will you...go back east?
Mr. Bohannon has...
asked me to stay
with the railroad.
So...perhaps he's the answer
to your prayers.
A man with the mark of Cain.
That would be ironic.
You have feelings for him.
Don't you?
Why we going to Cheyenne?
- I already told you.
- No, you ain't.
- When you tell me?
- Would you just shut--
shut up.
You're makin' my head hurt.
Ho.
What we doing?
Men coming up behind us.
Don't look back.
Who they?
Told you not to look back.
Who is it?
Damn it, Elam!
Come on.
Get up.
Get back on.
Get to the border of Cheyenne,
fast and straight.
Hyah!
Aah!
Hyah!
Get that chair!
Come on!
Don't move.
Bohannon!
What in God's name is going on?
I'd keep my head down
if I was you!
Ooh!
Go!
Ugh!
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Hyah!
- Who the hell's out there?
- No idea.
What's that smell?
- I'm drunk.
- Christ!
Yep.
- Get that boy upstairs!
- You get him upstairs.
This is my hotel, and those
windows cost a fortune!
Otis!
Where's my yellow boy?
- You a good shot?
- I can take the ear
off a rabbit at 200 yards--
left or right.
- Otis, you got any coffee?
- In the back.
Bring it!
Here.
Anybody comes through
that door or that door,
you shoot 'em.
Come on.
You know how to use that thing?
All right, then.
Stay right there.
Shit!
No matter what happens,
no matter what you hear,
you don't leave
till I come back, you got me?
All right.
I ain't leavin' you, son.
Now, you drink that.
Them men come at us
on the way over here.
After your invite.
Not everything bad
that happens to you
- is my fault, Bohannon.
- Mostly it is.
I told you
there was a range war coming.
Not all my neighbors
are happy with my decision
to sell livestock
to the railroad.
Or build this town.
No, they come after me.
I don't think is a first
for you, Bohannon.
Whoever they is,
they got us outnumbered
and outgunned.
We gonna need a plan.
Otis, you got any food, water?
Not much.
Shit.
We got women and children
in here.
All they got to do
is wait us out.
This town got a telegraph
office, don't it?
Yes. Up the street.
Major Bendix
only a few hours from here.
You go out there,
you'll be dead
long before
the cavalry gets here.
That is a distinct possibility.
You keep 'em off me till
I get across the street,
we might make it.
You got that boy upstairs.
I'll go.
What?
You want me to cover you?
Drunk or sober,
you a better shot than me.
Gotta be me that go.
Bohannon!
You're surrounded!
Come out!
Guns down!
You have my word,
nobody'll be hurt.
All we want is Bohannon!
You ain't believin' him.
Ain't no sense
in all of us getting killed.
You're right.
I'll go talk to them,
see what they want with you,
negotiate a settlement.
Oh!
What now?
Otis, how much whiskey you got?
Ah!
Aah!
Aah!
Damn it.
Aah!
We too late.
Oww.
Tell you what.
This railroad business
is funner than shit.
It beat picking cotton
from can see to can't see.
First year of the war
I thought...
"Best damn thing
that ever happened to me."
I hated farming.
Rather be anywhere
than ass-deep
in Mississippi mud...
running behind a mule all day.
How long before
you changed your mind?
Just did.
That little boy
waiting for you.
No matter what happen
out there,
you make it to that hotel,
you hear?
I don't...
You finish that road.
And, Elam...
I never freed my slaves.
I always figured
you was lying about that.
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.
Elam.
I know.
Ah!
Psst.
- Ah!
- Ah! They stormed the place.
Where the boy at?
Wha--they took him.
They took that boy
to get at you.
Hey.
You might need this.
I'm gonna take the back.
Let the boy go.
Soon as you drop your gun belt.
Boy ain't got nothin'
to do with this.
What you want?
You for the boy.
All right.
Let him go.
You drop your gun belt
and you come out
where I can see you.
Mr. Ferguson's
back along the way.
You go with him
back to the hotel.
Go on.
Ezra.
You listen to Miss Ruth,
you hear me?
Go on.
They say why they took him?
I think it's the Mormons
for him taking the workers.
Huntington warned him
about that.
I know you're not fool enough
to go after him.
I'm gonna do
what needs to be done.
Bohannon said
keep building the railroad
with or without him.
- I aim it to be with him.
- Mr. Ferguson.
Mr. Ferguson!
Going after him is suicide.
Look around you.
Do you want to face
those men again, alone?
I'm gonna keep my word
to Bohannon.
Then I'm busting him free.
You can count on that.
Uh, Miss Ellison.
Yes?
Uh...
Mrs. Toole will be
leaving us, I'm afraid.
What do you mean?
Well, the woman's a whore,
Miss Ellison.
Mrs. Toole is not a whore.
And even if she were,
I expect that
to be as little concern to you
as your previous misadventures
are to me.
I run a respectable
establishment.
Prior to becoming
Mr. Mortimer Ramsey,
proprietor of this hotel,
you lived in Omaha?
Calling yourself...
ah, Dr. Henry Whitford.
Until the deaths
of three patients
hastened a name change
and a move west.
Clearly, you are mistaken.
The deaths were attributed
to an overdose
of "perpetual sunshine"...
a miracle elixir
you widely prescribed,
claiming it would cure
just about anything,
which I guess, technically,
death does, doesn't it?
I'm a newspaper woman,
Mr. Ramsey.
People talk to me about this,
that, and the other.
Now, as for my guest,
she will be staying on
until she finds other,
more suitable, lodgings.
Are we clear on that?
Yes.
Lovely.
Have a good day.
I don't want to cause
no trouble.
No trouble at all, Eva.
Listen, and if that man
gives you any more guff,
you just talk to me, okay?
Let me know.
Why you doing this for me?
You're a good woman, Eva.
You've just had
some tough luck.
Thank you.
Uh...
it's what you want, ain't it?
Is that what you think?
Well, I seen the way
you look at me.
Eva...
that's not why
I asked you to stay here.
Well, I thought...
What?
That--that you're not worthy
of my friendship?
Eva, you are.
I don't accept
no charity, so...
Eva...stay.
Please.
Oh, shit.
I told you...
you owe me a life
for the one you took from me.
It was me that killed
my brother, Ruth.
It was him that caused it.
And it will be me
that has to answer for it
when the time comes, not you.
What did that detective
think Sean had done in Boston?
Strangle someone?
A woman?
You led him to believe
Sean was about to do that to me.
On my mother's soul.
I thought he was.
We'll never know, will we?
The truth.
What he was.
The truth is,
I saved your life.
I have faith.
One day you'll see that.
Listen up, gentlemen.
Cullen Bohannon's gone.
A gang of riders
caught us up in Cheyenne
and took him.
I don't know where,
or if he'll be back.
I don't even know if he alive.
Raise a posse,
Mr. Ferguson.
We'll find him!
All: Yeah!
We can't afford to lose
no men to no posse, not today.
Are you saying
we leave him out there to die?
We get to Cheyenne first.
Then we look for him.
Bohannon hisself say
this railroad come first.
And ain't not one of us be here
except for him and what he done
and how he done it.
We wouldn't be this far...
if it wasn't for him.
- No doubt about that.
- I know that.
We don't get to Cheyenne
by tomorrow night,
Durant gonna come back
and run this railroad.
Whether Bohannon here or not.
Now, Bohannon worked me
to the bone.
But he worked hisself
right next to me.
He ain't never give
none of us nothing
that we ain't earned.
- That's right!
- And when he did,
he stand by it.
Bohannon called me a nigger...
but he ain't never
treat me like one.
Durant a man that cheated,
lied,
and stole and disrespected
every last one of us!
Now, we gonna get this track
to Cheyenne.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
The way Bohannon do.
One rail at a time!
All: Yeah!
- One rail at a time!
All: Yeah!
One rail at a time!
All right, boys!
Let's get to work!
- Let's lay 'em out!
- Y'all grab them spikes!
Let's all get ready to go!
Come on!
Lift!
