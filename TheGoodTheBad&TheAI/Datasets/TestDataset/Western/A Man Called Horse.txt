Oh, Wakantanka,
Great Spirit of the Sun...
source of all life, created
in violence, pleasure and pain
which then takes life
to sustain life,
continuing the eternal cycle
of life and death...
l stand humble and obedient
before you.
Make me worthy!
How many is that?
Six, Your Lordship.
Maddock.
l'm sorry.
"John."
You may address me as "John."
Yes, sir.
lt won't happen again.
You slip at least
once a day.
How many weeks have l been
dinning it into you.
Yes, Sir John.
Six, did you say?
ln a row.
That's good shootin', John.
Thank you, Maddock.
You may address me as "Joe."
Joe.
What did you say that was?
Prairie chicken.
Grouse.
Huh?
Grouse.
At home in England,
l'd be shooting grouse.
lt just occurred to me,
l've traveled halfway
around the world
at great expense
simply to kill
a different kind of bird.
Well, what's wrong with that
if you ain't got
nothing better to do?
Oh, l ain't, Joe.
For five years, l ain't got
nothin' better to do.
You musta picked up a lot
of beans
somewhere.
Not only beans, Joe
but family titles, family
property, family position...
all picked up,
all inherited.
Everything l ever wanted
in life l've bought,
including you three.
ln England, l looked up
to God and royalty
and down upon everybody else.
Well, what you been doin'
for five years?
Looking, Joe.
Just looking.
ln 1820, l committed
the unpardonable sin
of resigning my commission
in the Guards.
lt wasn't an earned commission
anyway.
ln my family,
it came with birth.
So, here l am...
shooting birds.
Your Northwest Territory...
it is beautiful.
Hey, Ed...
l dumped the water outta that
damned tub into his tent.
All over his tent...
And look what l found.
Oh.
Rum.
That spell "rum", don't it?
R-U-M.
Yeah.
Hey, Ed... draw.
Still drunk as coots.
l'm going to have
to talk to those two.
ln a pinch, l've known
'em to drink coal oil.
Oh... beat the drums
and sound the brass,
here come one big horse's ass.
What were you two firing at?
Nothin' in particular.
That was an accident.
Even at this range,
l'm inclined to believe you.
How long would it take us
to go back to St. Louis?
Maybe a month if,
if we don't do no more huntin'
and that wagon holds up.
We'll start in the morning.
lf the wagon breaks down,
abandon it and the team.
We'll travel by riding horses
if necessary.
ls them orders, John?
Those are orders, Maddock.
Well, you've boozed us
out of another job.
We ain't shuttin' down camp.
He guaranteed us
four months wages.
You'll get your money.
That's one thing
the dude ain't is... cheap.
Yeah, and if he runs
a little short,
his family can always
sell the "cawstle'.
Oh, l never seen such a fella.
He won't even chew tobacco.
That water's powerful cold,
Your Lordship.
Thank you, Maddock.
l can assure you l've been bred
to get used to it.
This ain't gonna be no bath.
He's goin' ice-skating.
Listen, you rum-heads,
that's enough.
We was just warnin' him.
Somethin' must have spooked him.
Coyote maybe.
Naw. He seen Tin-pan Morgan
goin' by.
Oh, my God.
Christ!
l've had enough!
You bunch of bloody bastards.

And why l do this?
Because you want
