Mornin', son.
Mornin'.
We're a little off our course.
There's a played-out mine
somewheres around here.
Know of it?
There's a lot of old mines
around here.
This one is bein' worked
by a fellow name of Sand.
Samuel Sand.
He's my father.
You don't say, boy?
Well, son,
your pappy and me,
we hunted buffalo
together in the army.
We thought it only decent
to stop by and say howdy.
About three miles on,
the second canyon,
you pick up the trail
going west.
You'll see the buildings plain.
You have a first name, boy?
Max.
Much obliged, Max.
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Now you keep out of this, squaw!
Now, where is the gold?!
You tell me,
where is the gold?!
Take it easy, easy.
Come on, Sam.
Sam... it ain't
no use holdin' out.
There ain't no gold, Jesse.
When you gonna get that
in your stupid head?
Now, look!
You're working
a so-called dead mine
but you brought it
back to life.
Now, you found something
you're sittin' on
real cute-like, right?!
Would I be living like this?
You understand, we don't want
all of it, just half.
Of nothin'!
Oh, you've been
spreadin' gold dust
around Owl Creek
like snow!
That were a day's
work, that's all.
You paid your store bill
with a solid gold nugget.
I've been working two years...
one nugget, $38.
Wouldn't even pay for
the shovels I wore out.
Look, we didn't ride
all the way out here to argue.
You're going to tell us
where it is, Sam,
or you're going to tell us
with your dyin' breath!
Now, where is it?!
Whoa, boy, easy...
Well, ain't that
right handsome beadwork?
You fashion it yourself, squaw?
Yeah, it's been 15 years
since I skinned
an injun, squaw man!
But I ain't forgot the way.
Please... leave her be.
I tell you,
there ain't any gold.
I swear it, none.
I'm not afraid.
Max...
they're both dead.
No, there's nothing
you can do now.
Max!
Max, stay out of there.
For God's sake, stay out!
Max, come on into town with me.
They don't even look
like people anymore.
Their sufferin's over.
I don't want anybody
to ever see them
lookin' like that... ever.
Go away.
Leave me alone, please.
Gid'up.
My... God!
Max, you poor child.
Now, you come live with us.
Now I mean it.
I can't.
We've got acres of land
and a lifetime of work.
I've got to find
those three men.
And if you do?
Revenge isn't God's way.
Oh, save
your preachin', Ben.
But you're only a boy.
They're hard and vicious men.
Get 'em, Max.
You go get 'em.
Elvira...
Well, why not?
If he doesn't, who will?
The law!
The law... what law?
Max...
at least wait a day, rest up.
Maybe I can catch 'em
with that gray horse
before they sell it.
Here... here, Max.
Miss McCandles, I got a rifle,
a horse and eight dollars.
It'll hold.
Well, then, good luck.
Don't forget the way back.
I'll remember you both
for your kindness.
Larry!
Who the hell are you?
My name is Max.
Max Sand.
Just a kid.
Indian.
Half-breed.
You alone?
Spit it out... quick!
I was following three men
who killed my mother and father
and I thought you were the ones.
Are we the ones?
No.
How long have you been tracking
these killers?
Three, four days.
When did you eat last?
Couple of days ago!
Pick up the horses...
and join us.
Hey, kid.
Why don't you go home, huh?
I mean, while you
still have a chance.
Don't have a home.
Hey, how can you guys
be so friendly?
After what I tried to do?
Well, everybody in this world
is foolish in his own way.
Besides,
we were all kids once ourselves.
Weren't we now?
Don't move, mister!
Now turn around...
with your hands up.
Now, all I want
is some food and a horse.
I haven't seen
one of them old guns in years.
Keep away.
It won't work, you know.
I said stay back!
Well, the barrel's all rusted
up, and the hammer's broke.
And besides,
they haven't made ammunition
for one of them
things in ten years.
You want to trade?
I could use something to eat.
You've been through about 25
pounds of food in three days.
You think you're ever
going to get filled up?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't think.
I know it's a long ways
to haul food.
Well, finish it up,
if you can.
I can.
I didn't expect you
to be so generous.
Think I was going to throw you
to the coyotes?
You had every right.
I meant to kill you if I had to.
You an old hand at killing?
I killed my share
of deer and... rabbits.
Ever hold a gun on a man?
No.
You're setting out
to kill three of them, huh?
Bang, bang, bang.
You figure
you're going to make it
'cause you got right
on your side?
It helps.
They bury a sheriff
about once a week out here.
Well, I just figure
it's a matter
of me killing them
before they kill me.
Now, you want to show me
some of this fancy gun work?
Turn around and face the sun.
Hit that.
Go on home, boy.
Take the shortcut.
The sun was in my eyes,
and I wasn't expecting it.
You expect a man's going
to hold still for you
with the sun at your back,
then give you a warning
so you can stand there
and shoot at him?
I can hit a rabbit
at 80 yards with a rifle.
A rabbit don't shoot back.
How do you think you're going
to swing a rifle in a barroom?
I never been in a barroom.
Look, just to find them,
you're going to have to comb out
every saloon, gambling hall,
hog farm and whorehouse
between here and Mexico.
What do you think you're after,
three preachers?
You going to gun
them down at 80 yards
when they're coming
out of a church social?
You're hunting
three men who steal
because they're
too damn lazy to work
and they kill
because they love to.
Then they hide out
like rats in the garbage.
So if you're going to get them,
you're going to have to eat,
drink and wallow
in that garbage right with them
till you get so you think
like them and smell like them.
I'll do what I have to do.
It ain't that easy, kid.
Finding them is one thing,
killing them is another.
I'll figure out ways.
Ah.
Well, I've been selling guns
and ammunition
to men like that for 15 years
and they got more ways
to cripple and kill a man
than you ever dreamed about.
They'll shoot you in the back,
they'll ambush you...
they'll cut your throat
while you're laying asleep.
All you got going on your side
is some blind Indian revenge.
I'm half-white.
And you're all helpless.
Now, you get so you can do that
with either hand...
and you're half-drunk
or half-awake,
or inside of a dark room
off the back
of a running horse...
you might stand a chance.
A small chance.
Would you teach me?
I sell guns,
I don't teach killing.
Then I'll learn myself.
You won't live that long.
Well, thank you
for the food
and advice, Mr. Cord.
I guess I'll be on my way.
Where to? How? What with?
You know, if I did teach
you something,
that's only half of it.
While you're looking
for them three men
you gotta live, don't you?
You gotta eat.
You need clothes, food, horses,
saddles, guns,
ammunition, money.
How are you gonna get that?!
Tracking beaver on Sundays?
I'll tell you how you get it.
You'll wind up stealing
and killing.
You'll turn yourself into
the same kind of animal
you're trying to track down.
Can't you see that?
I don't see nothin'...
except my father laying
on a blood-covered floor
all burnt and cut
with the top of his head
blown to pieces.
And my mother...
split up the middle
and every square inch
of her skin ripped off.
Well...
God help us.
Pick up that brass.
Them cartridges cost
a cent and a half apiece.
Sit down.
Little poker suit you?
Well, not too much.
You know how
to play cards, don't you?
No.
I guess I can teach you.
Have a drink.
Well, I...
You don't drink either?
No.
Where you're going,
you'd best study up on it.
Now, the lowest hand
you can get
is a pair...
that's two of a kind.
Then two pair
and three of a kind,
then a straight.
Three of what kind?
Three of anything...
three nines, three tens,
three jacks.
Which ones are the tens?
Don't you know
how to read?
Well, I never went to school.
Know how to write?
Well, if I know how to write,
I'd know how to read.
Anything you can do?
Reach.
That's an awtul waste
of good whiskey.
Where you were goin',
you wouldn't need whiskey.
All right.
A ten has got ten spots on it.
You can count that far
on your toes.
Max...
Listen, you take it
easy around here.
It's just a quiet town.
I know people,
I do business with them.
Well, all right.
But listen, Mr. Cord,
if you happen to see...
Yeah, I know, if I see
anything suspicious
like a horse
with an "SS" brand,
I'll come get you.
Here's a buck...
go buy yourself some candy.
Yes, sir, can I help you today?
Can of peaches.
A big can, please.
Best Eastern peaches
in the West.
Would you open it for me?
No charge.
Hey, you got a book
that teaches you
readin' and writin'?
McGuffey's Primer,
right under the stairs.
Hey, uh...
Of course, you can't pick
one out until you can read,
and you can't read until
you can pick one out, can you?
It's this here one.
Or, as McGuffey would
say, "this one here."
That's 25 cents for the peaches
and ten cents for the book.
Funny, isn't it?
Ideas don't weigh much,
but peaches do
and the freight company
charges by the weight.
You know, six books, it's...
oh, it isn't
very important.
Most people are hungrier
in their stomachs
than they are in
their minds anyway.
Well, there's
your first decision:
Now, that sign on the top
says "Silver City."
That's over in Colorado.
And the second one...
the one over there...
that's "Donner,"California.
The one on the bottom, see,
that says "Sonora."
That's down south
in Old Mexico.
I-I sure can't tell you
which way to go,
but you want to catch 'em,
you best go
where the money is.
If they got it,
they're going to head
for where they can spend it.
If they ain't got it,
they'll go where
they can steal it.
Mr. Cord, I...
I just don't know how
I'm ever going to be able
to pay you back for all this.
No need to.
I tell you what,
you get tired of chasing them,
you look me up,
and we'll talk about it,
all right?
Well, no use drawing this out.
Good luck, Max.
Bang, bang.
Yeah...
Very nicely done.
You know, handlin'
one of these things
is only half of it.
The other part's
learning human nature.
That's going to take you
the rest of your life,
so you damn well better not
trust anybody till you do.
Now, you want
to plan your moves,
pick your place to fight,
don't make any threats...
and don't you ever walk
away from one, you hear?
Good-bye, Max.
Bye, Mr. Cord.
Don't even trust a friend.
Hyah, hyah.
Hyah, hyah.
Hyah, hyah, hyah.
Hyah.
Come on, Struther,
you've washed
your little, thin body enough.
Look how white I am.
Struther, please hurry up.
Hey, the dames are comin'! Hey!
Hey, the dames are coming!
Struther,
you'd better hurry up
and get out of there.
They're comin' up here.
Hank!
Red!
Cat got your tongue?
Well, come on.
- Gee, you're cute.
- Wal-Walter.
- Walter? How are you, Walter?
- Howdy... ma'am.
Hey, look at me!
Want to come downstairs
and have a drink?
- Hey!
- Shut up.
What's the matter with me?
Whoo!
Hey, don't be
backin' off like that.
Hey, hey, one of you...
Well... well...
Hey, I'm in the tub.
Hello, cowboy.
Welcome to town.
Try the next room.
White women more popular.
Well, they saved me for you.
Navajo?
Kiowa.
I am Kiowa, too.
Well, yes or no?
Five dollars...
...for some questions.
I'm lookin' for three men,
they ride together.
And one of them...
the name is Jesse...
got a scar on his neck,
carries a knife.
May be riding a gray horse.
You ever seen
any people like that?
Lots of men
come through here,
lots of men with scars.
Buy yourself some moccasins.
Why do you ask for them?
They tortured
and killed a woman...
Kiowa, like you.
One man...
...has a... scar here.
He works downstairs
dealing cards in the bar.
Oh, but he might not be
the same man.
Where does he keep his horse?
In the stable across the street.
But, please,
don't tell anyone I told you.
Hey, mister?
Yeah?
That gray for sale?
I don't think so.
Belongs to Jack Langley
over at the Palace Bar.
I don't think
he'll sell him, though.
I'll open for 20.
I'll have to call you.
I'll call at 20.
Call.
No more bets.
Jesse.
Any cards, boys?
You!
Dealin' cards.
Jesse who?
"Jesse Coward."
"Jesse Murderer."
"Woman killer."
Now, wait a minute,
my name is Jack Langley.
When you killed
my mother and father...
it was Jesse.
Look, I'm Jack Langley.
Where did all this killin'
take place, boy?
Hey, Hudson, what's my name?
Jack Langley.
How long I worked here?
Year, year and a half.
Anything else?
Stand up!
Now look, I'm not armed.
My father wasn't armed
when you tied him to a post
and blew the top
of his head off.
Now, kid, settle...
I know what I'm doin'!
He's ridin'
my father's horse.
I'm ridin' my own horse.
With an "SS" brand.
Look, I bought that horse.
I have a bill of sale
for it in my room.
Fair enough.
Let's see it.
Now look, son...
if Langley here
did what you said,
I'll sit on him
and let you kill him.
But if he's got
a bill of sale upstairs,
you could have the wrong man.
It's happened before.
Let's look.
Come on, both of you.
You fight like your mother, boy.
Should have taken you
to a sailmaker
to get stitched up.
That McGuffey reader
inside your shirt
kept that knife
away from your stomach.
Kid, the minute you get off
that table, you'll move on.
How can he move on?
How can he ride a horse
with all them stitches in him?
That's up to him.
Kid, you killed a man...
as you tell it,
for good reason.
Now, you did
what you had to,
and that's what I'm doin'.
If we don't drive you out,
there'll be more killin'.
You got any friends?
No.
There's an Indian dance hall
girl been askin' about you.
Maybe she can help.
Where...?
How did you get...?
You come back to us
in trouble... and in pain.
You are welcome.
How long?
Many days.
You talk in fever
of the death of your father,
and Tabinaka,
my brother's daughter.
You stay here
with your own people.
Neesa...
she became shame of Kiowa.
But she bring you home.
That's good.
Maybe both of you
make each other well.
You stay here.
Oh, no!
You get right back
in there.
It's hot water,
and it's good for you.
"See...
"See the frog... on a log.
"Rab sees the frog.
The frog..."
Three weeks, you sit here,
you never laugh,
you never smile.
"Can the frog see Rab?
Rab can't..."
You learned to read
not to make you wise,
but to help you
find men to kill.
"The frog can see the dog.
Rab ran at..."
Do you think that I became
a dance hall girl
because I was bad?
It was because
I was full of hatred
and foolish.
"See the lamp.
It..."
If there was a medicine
that would change
the way I was,
I would take it.
Do you know of one?
Neesa, it ain't got
nothing to do with you.
Honestly, nothing.
If I could find a medicine,
I'd take it myself.
Really?
For true.
See... the... lamp?
lt... is... out.
It ain't gonna work, Neesa.
Why?
'Cause I'm gonna
have to go soon.
When?
One morning I'll be gone.
Make yourself at home.
You... lookin' for anything
in particular?
Names, that's all.
I'm no thief.
Yeah.
What kind of names?
Friends of Jesse Coe's.
Are you a friend of Jesse Coe's?
I'm the one that killed him.
My name is Angie...
Mrs. Coe.
You might call me
"the widow Coe."
I don't know what to say.
I do.
Thank you.
Tell me about the men
he rode with.
You know, you look young.
But any man that could take
Jesse Coe with a knife
had to be some man.
You know where they are.
Do you know their names?
Well, I think...
one of 'em's name is... Bowdre...
Bill Bowdre.
He wanted Jesse to go
on a bank job with him
down in Louisiana.
And it's really too bad
he didn't go.
Why?
'Cause they got caught,
put in prison.
There was one other one.
I don't know his name.
That's all I can tell you.
Mm...
"Western... gang...
robs..."
"Bank... of...
New Orleans."
"Two..."
"ap..."
Hey, Cap...
what's that word?
The word is "apprehended."
Well... what does it mean?
Well, it means like caught.
Say anything here about
where they were taken?
No.
Fella gets caught
robbing a bank down here,
and they throw him right
into the state prison camp.
Much obliged.
Corbin?
Yeah.
How do you want yours?
Just money.
Sand?
How do you want it?
I want all of it,
in that bag.
Max...
Shut up!
The big money's in the vault.
Get back!
Stay there.
There's only one
this time, Warden.
Two years... he robbed a bank.
"Two years, hard labor."
That's the only kind
we got here.
Startin' with me,
everything in this place
is mean and miserable...
the heat, the mosquitoes,
the food, the life.
There's nothing to do
all day but work,
and nothing to do
at night but sleep.
We don't have
any walls or fences.
The swamp is our wall...
miles and miles of it,
filled with dirty water,
quicksand, moccasins
and malaria.
Any questions?
No.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Just one more thing.
Don't ever make me mad.
Big Foot?
Yes, sir, Warden?
Get him out of here.
Put him in Miller's bunk.
Yes, sir, Warden.
Let's go.
Right over there.
Don't be lookin'
at this gun, boy.
They want you to go for it.
Case you're wonderin',
I'm a prisoner,
just like yourself.
I'm a trustee.
In there.
You don't get
to keep anything, boy.
Get a blanket,
your clothes.
You get a bath
and shave once a week.
One razor for
the whole barracks.
You take your time.
This is your bunk.
Belonged to a fella
named Miller.
He died.
The only way to get
out of here, is it?
Oh, they try it
all the time, boy,
through the swamps.
Dogs are out after
two of them right now.
They tried to rob
a bank in New Orleans.
Bowdre.
Bowdre and Strayhorn.
They friends of yours?
No... I read
in the paper.
Did they make it?
Nobody's made it
since I been here, boy.
Let's get over to
the blacksmith's shop...
put these leg irons on you.
Something botherin' you, boy?
Yeah.
Let's go!
Big Foot!
Get 'em all out here
so they can watch this.
Let's go.
Big Foot!
Now you listen to this:
Strayhorn died in the swamp.
Bowdre here is going
to wish he did, too.
When he serves his time,
he's going to serve
every day of Strayhorn's.
You think about that... hard.
That ain't done here!
A man lies where he falls!
He'll drown!
The warden's watching you, boy.
Back to the mess hall!
Let's move, let's move!
