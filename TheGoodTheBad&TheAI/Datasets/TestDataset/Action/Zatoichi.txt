Boy...
Bring us the walking stick
of that blind bone-setter.
We'll pay you.
Watch out.Silence,he will hear you.
Thanks.
GO GO!
Go away,you son of a..!
Icci!
Even you...
...were fooled
by an innocent child!
Even the teacher...
...is weak
without his sword.
SEMETERY
Drink!
What are you doing?
You were working for Naruto.
Don't you recognise us?
Of the Naruto family?
I am the daughter!
What do you want again?
We've paid for this month!
You haven't paid for today.
Now you 're gonna pay
each time we come by.
-We wont be able to survive.
-Dont protest!
Shut up and pay.
Things were really bad with
the Funahatsi gang.
-Ginjo makes our life real hell!
-Damn you!
Unbelievable spectacle!
I guide a blind bone-setter
who curries my vegetable.
I wish i could see that!
You did a big favour for me.
Drink some tea.
-It's hot.
-Thanks.
Without your help...
...i couldn't bring them home.
Where are you sleaping tonight?
It will be the first time that you come.
You're welcome to stay.
I live alone.
Don't get any ideas.
I don't even thing about it.
-Is it too strong?
-No,it's just as it should be.
I can't thing that our
town is doomed.
Ginjo and Oggi are fine together.
They do us they want with us.
Really?You have such punks?
They teriffy the farmers.
and the town people.
They demand money for protection
every day.
If it keep going like this...
...the more we work,
the poorer we get.
You pay for protection each day?
We didnt use to.
We were paying each month.
Big difference.
Eacg month,each day.
Exactly.
Are you allright;
We'll stay here for a while.
I will work again as a bodyguard.
Don't you worry about me.
Don't do that job for me.
One day i'll become a clerk again.
Stop worrying.
You need some rest.
Eh,old man!
Where is Grandfather;
He's sick today.
HE won't come.
-You make him work toomuch.
-I'm sorry.
You must take care of him more.
Sake is awful,as always.
Can't get any better.
Same old story for 10 years!
Can you give it to that guy?
I'm not your clerk!
What a nerve!
Can't you take the by yourself?
Drink at the bench!
W-w-welcome.
Leave the "welcomes".
Where is this month's money?
Please,
giveme some time.
What a joke!
We never wait!
I'll find the money.
Say hello to your boss.
Your sake sucks!
Shut up!
What do you want?
Send a message to your boss.
Capable RONIN looks for bodyguard job.
Samurai...
It's late.
Ginjo boss probably
won't come.
Samurai,you're the one that seeks
for a master to protect?As a bodyguard?
Show me what you can do.
Well..
Not the rope.
Look at your leg.
Bone-setter,i'm off to the fields.
Tell me,lady...
Can i do something to help?
Thank you for offering your help...
...but i cannot ask from a blind
man to cut the woods.
Don't you care about it.You get some rest.
My dear...
You came back late last night.
-Anything happened?
-I found a good job.
As a bodyguard again?
I beg you,don't do it for me.
I beg you,stop doing this kind of jobs.
Don't be fool.
With the money you may get well.
Tell me...
You hired that RONIN?
Yes.
We have 2 problems to solve.
We must clean Ijutsu and Funahatsi.
After that the town will be yours,boss.
Try not to be very hard.
Yes.
Don't you worry.
Really...Do you have any news
on the Heihatsi murder?
Some rumours.It is said
that he was kill by a geisa.
That's what we know for now.
A bit more,bone-setter?
No,thank you.
I've had enough.Thanks again.
My lady,while i was cutting woods...
...someone was running round the house.
What was he?
Neighbour's son.
He's crazy with a certificate.
Don't you pay to him.
He imagines that he's a samurai.
He runs like that all day.
Samurai!
So...
-I'll be out for a while.
-For work?
Not exactly.
For this.
What?You gamble?
Better stay away from that.
My nephew is addicted to gambling.
He refuses to work,
he gambles all day.
WHat can i say...
He's lost from the face of the earth.
For me,it's a pleasure.
Some pleasures can be
very dangerous.
What do u think?
This sword cost me a fortune.
Yes,mr.Oggi,a wonderfull sword.
I will give it back to Lord Sakai.
He will be very please to
do work with us.
Sure.
I'd say that you test it on the
first beggar that comes by.
-Who?Me?
-Yes,you!
Thanx you,master,
but you better do it.
No way!
I'm not makin my kimono dirty!
You do it!
Why don't you take a RONIN?
You fool!
Hire a RONIN
to test a sword?
-Do as i say!
-But...
Someone's coming!
Slaughter that blind man.
Do it fast!
Are you afraid of a blind man?
My...sword!
I'm sorry!
You fool!
Are we playing!
New game!
Any objections?
A blind man?
-Sit here,blind man.
-I am a bone-setter.
-Even.
-No more bets.
We're playing.
I'm unlucky.
New game.
Any objections?
Any objections?
Odd.
-You don't bet?

You watch?But you are blind.
Boss!
The bodyguard is here.

End of bets.
We're playing.

It's over.
Mr.Oggi's problems

There he is.
A bit of sake..
Old man...
May i have some sake?
Samurai...
Bone-setter...
Your walking stick!I'm sorry.
What a lovely walking stick.
Bone-stter...
I'm not a usual bone-setter.
You also stink blood yourself.
It's a bit uncomfortable in here.
No use pulling your sword like that.
My dear...
You had to kill again?
You fool!
It's a bot early for a fuss like that.
Go home.
The battle is over.
My bone-setter didn't come back last night.
Maybe he found a woman.
OGGI
SIR!
I'm going to Lord Sakai.
Hold on.
On your way back...
...get something tasty to eat.
Thank you,sir!
Next!Kaneko Hishiro!
Some RONIN are really strong.
Hatori will gace them.
You coward!
The art of battle is not the walking stick.
The real samurai uses his sword!
Are you Yamatzi Isaburo?
Yes.
Who are you?
Hatori Genosouke.
I must kill you to regain my honur.
Grab your sword!
Kill me if you want.
I never...
...owned a sword.
Where do you find honour...
..in killing a crippled man like me?
The art of battle is not the walking stick!
A real samurai uses his sword!
He's half-dead.
No point in killing him.
Come,quickly!
Why you're such a rush?
Shut up!I wanted to see you.
It is better like this,ain't it?
New game.
Any objections?
Place your bets.
Bet in what?
Odd.

Thanks to that bone-setter,
i've gathered a fortune.
SO,you wanna pay for one night with us?
Bone-setter...
Wannna have some fan?
I'll talk to the mistress.
I'll find5-6 geisas.
I'll take care of it,young master.
You stay here.I'll go.
Ah!It hurts!
I am not a rabbit!
Dont'pull my ears!
No violence!
Don't be naughty!
That much?Not possible!
Ah!It hurts!
Can i stand a small needle?
No,the smaller the needle...
...the greater the pain!
Very funny!Come over.
-Drink something.
-Thank you.
Really funny!
Seen that,bone-setter?
Can't see much.
Osei,are you ready to dance?
Dance!Great!
Come on,dance!
Miss Okinu...
...why u pulled out the strings?
You want our money?
And you,miss Osei...
...aren't you a guy?
You don't smell a woman.
Blind men...
are sensitive in that matters.
Hidden sword?
What all these mean?
Bone-setter...
you may think i am lying...
...but i'm gonna tell you the truth.
Our father...
...was a rich rise.
Come and see Snowy.
Don't tell anyone.
Heihatsi...
You pulled through for 7 years.
Heihatsi,where are they hidden?
-Here.
-How many are they?
The Narutos,both their children
Tasitsi,what have u found?
They've gathered a fortune!
Inosuke,we're rich for the rest of our lives!
Call the boss Kutsinawa.
You killed them all?
The kids?
We did'nt find them anywhere.
You full!
We don't have time.Let's go.
We've hunted Heihatsi,the servant.
What are you doing?
You were working for Naruto.
Don't you recognise us?
Of the Naruto family?
I am the daughter!
As far as the others concerned,
i only know their names.
Tell me their names.
Inosuke and Tasitsi.
They also mentioned the boss Kutsinawa.
That's what we know.
And all these years you were searching?
Even.
Wrong again!
I'll try with my eyes closed.
Like him.
How does he do that by only hearing?
I am so unlucky!
One got away!
That's the problem.
Odd.
Even.
I thinkk i got it.
My senses work better with my eyes closed.
Good!
Sinkitsi!
You're sitting with your eyes closed.
Won't you bet?
I 'm listening.
To what;
You're sitting here and listen?
I have the right to hear.
You were asking for it.
Don't play tough on me!
This dump needs customers.
You bastard!
Take it easy,Sinkitsi!
You can listen and bet.
You're calling me with my first name?
You shouldn't be talkin like that to a customer!
Customer?
You used to work for me.
Shut up and bet!
Bad for you.
Last sound was...
OK.
Odd!
Odd.
We're playing.
So?
Message for your boss.
What?
Go to hell!
-Is miss Ijutsu here?
-One moment,please.
May i ask what are youlooking for here?
Your late husband
owes money from gambling.
I am taking your store.
You got 3 days to go.
Not a day more.
-this is madness!
-Shut up!
Don't get involved ni our business!
You see those dolls?
-You know them?
-No.
I wish i new them!
The red one is hot.
Some more sake,please.
Osei...
Should we ask for job?
Sir...
You know if we can offer
our services anywhere?
We don't have jobs.
-You know anyone?
You can try at Mr.Oggi.
He's in charge now,
thanks to Ginjo.
To that mr.Oggi...
Can u introduce us to him?
Old man,help the ladies.
Grandfather,go find Oggi.
Go yourself,you bastard!
Don't take advantage of the old man!
Fast!
I present you the windmill!
Look how it spins.
Boss!
The tavern owner introduces
you to two geisas.
They are free tonight.
Great.Send them.
You two,go away!
Lord Sakai,in a while we will have
Fast.
What time are we playing?
Even.
Even!
End of bets.
We're playing.

Oggi!
I have to watch this for a long time?
Lets watch some dancing.
The show is over.Go away!
Time to dance,ladies.
Quickly!Dance!
Odd.
End of bets.
We're playing.
Bone-setter,
should we bet everything?
New game.
Any objections?
Eh!
The dice don't sound the same.
You damn bone-setter!
Master.
A bone-setter has turned the club upside-down.
Boss wants you to go.
A bone-setter?
Please,sir.
Let's go.
Leave me.
Come on.
Do as he says!
Don't touch me!
Are you ok?
Be careful where you're stepping at.
Watch out!
What are youlooking at?
Bone-setter...
Wait here.
I go see what's happening.
Ah!
Girls,this way!
Quickly!
That Oggi guy is horrible!
I hit him and we left when
the customer went to take Osei.
We had troubles in Ginjo store.
But the bone-setter had put
everybody to the ground.
It was unbelievable.
Who are you,anyway?
If we stay here,they'll find us shortly .
Lets go to my aunt's.
Not possible.Ginjo's men
are all over the place.
That's true.
I have an idea.
Okinu,you got any make-up?
Of course.
Bone-setter,come here.
Don't move.
-What is it?
-I paint eyes.
For me?
open!
Who's that this kind of hour?
-Who's that?
-Your nephew,Sinkitsi.
He probaly lost everything again.
Come in.
Who are these guys?
Watch out,bone-setter.
-Bone-setter!
-Yes,its me.
You are useless!
What happened to the bodyguard?
Everything was over when he came.
The bone-setter was allready gone.
Who's that bone-setter?
Don't really know.A bone-setter.
That punk,Sinkitsi,was with him.
He often goes the club.
It wouldn't be hard to track him.
We'll get the bone-setter too.
Firstly we must make the Funahatsi
gang extinct.
Don't you say...
We were suddenly going from town to town.
Cheating men and robbing them.
Ten years?
These punks must live differently now.
Hold on.
Wasn't Oggi here ten years ago?
Right.
Indeed,that Oggi...
Something's not right about him.
I saw his arm.
He has a snake tattoo.
One moment...
The names u just told...
You mentined someone named Kutsinawa?
Yes,right.
Kutsinawa means "rotten rope".
Maybe it means snake.
Right;
Bone setter!
Don't look me with these eyes!
I've heard about last night.
A bone-setter ruined your store.
Yes.
We run with the bodyguard.
But we were late.
Oggi...
How were those ladies?
Lord Sakai tried to take one.
But the other one hit me hard.
The way i saw them acting...
...i am sure they are not real geisas.
Listen...
Learn anything you can about
that bone-setter and the geisas.
We're playing.
Even.
Odd.
I won.
This is my home.
Go!Go away!
You're still eating?
I told you to clean up!
Young Seitaro,
master wants to see you.
You,clean up this mess!
Come with me,Seitaro.
You are so lovely!
from now on you will be my boy.
If you do what i say...
...your sister and you are
welcome to live here.
You want to live here?
I'll buy you some beautiful kimonos.
What are you doing there?
Stay away from the master's room!
No!
Sir...
You want to spent some time with me?
Osei...
Time for practise.
Sister...
WHat's wrong?
Nothing.
Are you ok?
Aunt,you have an umbrela?
Over there.
I'm going to see what's happening downtown.
Thank you.
Grandfather,where is the old man today?
He had something to take care of.
That dull man?
Why you're working in this dump?
Don't have any family?
Exactly.
He picked me from the streets
and offered my a job.
I was treated good.
I'm thankful for what he hs done for me.
It's better begging than working in here!
If you sit outside in the ground,
you'll earn more for sure.
New game.
Any ojections?
What are you doing here,bastards?
Pay,if you wanna play.
Watch out.
We were here first.
You're looking for trouble,bastard?
You're looking for trouble?
Ginjo wants to compete.
Stay back.
Oh my God!
Hold on...
It's over.
That bone-setter...
Do u think he's Zatoichi?
And that geisas...
..must be from the Naruto family.
Naruto's taking down...
When did this happen?
Ten years ago.
I see.
If the kids survive,
they must be grownups now.
I wonder...
That bodyguard...
' ' '
...is he capable of winning
Zatoichi?
Where is Oggi?
Boss Ginjo himself!
I'm glad you came!
This way please.
I've heard your business go well.
-I told you not to come here.
-don't worry.
Funahatsis are past.
We're in charge now.
The only thing left is to
make our pockets full.
Clean up in here!
Great news!
Funahatsi gang is extincted.
Ginjo gang and the bodyguard
slaughtered them all.
That Ginjo guy pays for that
tromendous bodyguard!
Bone-setter,you better
don't go to the town.
Sinkitsi,that bodyguard is
really so strong?
He's unbelievable.
If we had to face each other at night,
who would be the winner?
If it was so dark,
noone would see a thing.
The winner would be probably you.
You think it's funny?
Let's see you now.
I'll train you.Come!
I'teach you the art of battle.
Concentrate.
We start.
Attack from all sides.
Not all at the same time!
Let's try again.
For safety,let's plan the moves.
Listen to me.
Me first...
Like that...
You hit here.
Then...
...you!
And then,you.
Good.
Let's try.
You see?
You see what you can do?
Faster now.
Good.That's it!
Not like that!
It hurts,you fool!
End of leston.
You jerks!
What are you doing
You fool!Go home!
-I'll have a bath.
-Me too.
No!Men first.
I'm a man myself!
Bone-setter...
I'm thinkin of paying a visit to Oggi,again.
I have to know if he was one of the thiefs.
Water is cold.Boil it better!
Don't get on my nervers!Ain't it too much
allready you bathing yourself at daylight!
You're useless!
It isnt good cold.
Please,boil it a bit more.
That's what i'm doing!
I confess it's unbelievable.
You really look like a woman.
Make-up makes men more beautiful?
Not all.
Depends on the face.
Welcome.
We wanna ask sorry
from mr.Oggi.
He paid us to dance for him and
we treated him disrespectful.
Really?
Can you tell him we said sorry?
Sit down.
Oggi drinks too much.He probably
has allready forgotten abou it.
-Don't you worry.
-I hope you're right.
We haven't see you lately.
-Where do you live?
-At ms.Ume's house.
Is there a bone-setter living with you?
Are you allright,grandfather?
Throw'em out.
drink something.
Thank you.
Oggi and Ginjo are friends now.
They are preparing something.
But their job has nothing
to do with you.
One more?
Not yet.
I'm off to Oggi's.
I'll be late.
You wait here.
Oggi says he's not angry at all.
He likes you and wants to see you both.
thanx you very much.
Thank you for the sake.
Good luck.
Where are the others?
They 're off to the city.
What are youdoing over there?
Are you mad?
I wanna be beautiful,like Osei.
What are you craving for!
What's all this fuss?
You're back,silly kid?
-Where is the bone-setter?
-Who are you?
We want the bone-setter.
-He's not here.
-You cannot hide him from us.
But he's not here.
We''ll burn down the house and he will appear.
Burn it!
Stop!
Aunt Ume!we're in trouble!
The house is on fire!wake up!
We're in trouble!
Come on!
Quickly!
Who are these people?
Sinkitsi!
Damn!
Very beautiful woman.
Woman?
Thinks are not alwys what they
seem too be,Inosouke.
Don't use that old name.
The walls have ears here.
Myname now is Ginjo.
What are you looking at?
Keep dancing.
We know it all.
You're Naruto's kids.
-Bone-setter!
-Girls,go now.
Call the bodyguard.
Inosouke,where are you heading at?
-Where is the bodyguard?
-At his home.
Call him now!
Gimmie the sword!
On top of mama-turtle
goes the baby-turtle.
On top of baby-turtle
goes the baby-baby-turtle.
On top of baby-turtle
goes the baby-baby-baby-turtle.
Mama-turtle goes down...
...baby-turtle goes down,baby-baby-turtle
goes down,baby-baby-baby-turtle goes down too.
All the thiefs are dead.
Except boss Kutsinawa.
He must be really old now.
He'll be dead shortly anyway.
Don't think about him.
You better think about your future.
You can stay here.
You can become a man again.
I'm fine as i am now.
Where is the bone setter?
He must be somewhere around here.
But the fest starts today.
You found me.
How did you know?
Bitch.
You may change as much as u want...
...this awful smell will always stay the same.
Stop bullshitting,blind man!
I proudly accept that i am
boss Kutsinawa.
A blind man like yourself...
...Will not slaughter me easily!
WHat the hell!You're not blind?
-Not at all.
-Thwn why you pretend to be blind?
Cause blind men can
sense the world better.
I knew you could see!
I knew it from the first
time you came here.
You killed my men.
And Torakitsi
You kille dthe tavern man..
It was a kid from the streets.
I picked him up many years ago.
I taught him the business so
he could be my successor.
All my gang is gone...
...from a wandering
bone-setter like yourself.
How did u know that i was the
real boss Kutsinawa;
From the time you threw your walking
stick, to see the sword.
Your the worst
gangster of all.
Really;
I m like a cripple now.
My retirement time has arrived.
But i lived a full life.
I regret for nothing.
Come on, kill me!
U dont deserve death.
Finish your life as blind man!
Even with my eyes
wide open...
... I can't see anything!
