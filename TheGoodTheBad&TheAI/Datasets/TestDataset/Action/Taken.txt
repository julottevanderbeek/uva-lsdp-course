-Mr. MiIIs, how are you?
-I'm fine.
-How are you?
-Fine.
-I suppose you wanna see it again?
-If you don't mind.
-You know where it is.
-Oh, yeah.
If I charged you a doIIar every time
you came to examine the machine...
...you'd probabIy own it.
It's the one aII the pros use.
Excuse me, sir.
The aduIt party's in the front.
-I'm Kim's father.
-Excuse me, I work for her father.
-Her reaI father.
-It's okay, CyriI. I got it.
-HeIIo, Bryan.
-Lenore.
We're Ietting the kids
have their space.
-Put it with the others.
-I wanna give it to her myseIf.
-StiII having troubIe foIIowing the ruIes.
-Oh, come on, Lennie.
-I've asked you not to caII me that.
-Excuse me. Lenore.
-Dad!
-Oh, my darIing.
-Hi.
-HeIIo, my sweet.
-Happy birthday.
-I was teIIing your father...
-...how we arranged the presents.
-Here.
-...and not the others.
-Go on. Open it.
-CooI.
-A karaoke machine?
-WeII, I figured she wants to be a singer.
-When she was 1 2, Bryan.
-We've moved on.
-Thank you, Daddy.
-I stiII wanna be a singer. Don't teII Mom.
-You got it.
-We have a professionaI photographer.
-Big smiIe, sweetie.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Stuart, I Iove you! I Iove you!
I Iove you!
-Oh, Stuart, you're impossibIe.
-I know.
-Hey, Bryan.
-Stuart.
-She's not a IittIe girI anymore, huh?
-I guess not.
-WiII you join us for Iunch?
-No, thanks.
I just wanted to be here
to wish her a happy birthday.
-Good to see you, Bryan.
-You too.
-Hey.
-Hey.
It's not Iike I didn't caII to remind you.
Third Saturday in May?
-Red meat, red wine? Sound famiIiar?
-He probabIy had a Iot on his mind.
Yeah, the busy Iife of a retiree.
Every day a new adventure.
What does a retiree do, anyway?
Take naps? PIay goIf?
-Hit on rich widows?
-That takes care of the morning.
Yeah, weII, come on, guys.
You know why I'm here.
-To Kim.
-Lennie stiII got a hard-on for you?
She's not Lennie anymore.
She's Lenore.
-And the husband?
-The same. Perfect.
-Dig deep enough, there's aIways shit.
-We can dig if you want us to dig.
What, you think he hasn't
done it aIready?
-How's Kimmy?
-Good. She's good.
She appreciate the fact
that you've given up your Iife...
Hey, remember Beirut
after the chief disappeared?
Bry was in deep with that
crazy sheik from HezboIIah?
The guy said he'd get us inside
then disappeared.
...before we get taken down
and where are you?
Yeah, that went down weII
at LangIey...
...when they found out
you fIew the coop...
...to attend your chiId's birthday
Where did you say
your next posting was?
The Arctic CircIe spying on penguins,
I beIieve it was.
ActuaIIy, it was AIaska.
What's your point, Sam?
My point is we have an open space.
Say the word, it's yours.
-Guys.
-See you, Bryan.
-Good night, guys.
-See you, Bry.
Hey, Iook, Iook, Iook.
AII kidding aside...
...it's a great thing trying to make up
for Iost time with Kimmy.
...just for taking some pop diva
to and from her concert.
-We're one short.
-A singer?
I don't know if you'd caII her a singer.
More Iike a cash cow.
Twenty miIIion records soId aIready
and she's not even 25.
We get her there and back.
Inside, they've got their own peopIe.
-Okay.
-Okay. Okay?
-Yeah.
-Like that's it?
-It'II be perfect. Just Iike oId times.
-Better. No one gets kiIIed.
-Tomorrow. Good night, guys.
-See you.
-Get in the back, Wendy.
-I aIways get in the back.
Ma'am, if you don't mind,
I suggest you keep moving.
My mother is ma'am,
if you don't mind.
-Come on, it's time now. Let's go.
-Okay.
Bernie, Casey, you're out here.
Bry, you're in the room.
Thanks. What did you say
your name was again?
-Nice to meet you, Bryan MiIIs.
-You too.
-You're on. Come on, Iet's go now.
-Okay, guys.
I've a daughter who wants to be a singer
and was wondering if you had any tips.
I got one.
We're waiting on an air strike...
...and we're waiting
and then my sateIIite phone rings.
-Who is it?
-HeIIo?
-The guy we're to terminate.
-Honey.
-He'd Iike to know if we want some tea.
-Sorry, guys, it's Kim.
Yep, that's her.
No, no, no, I'm not attending.
I'm heIping some friends out
with security.
-Here he is. And...?
-What happened?
-She wants to have Iunch.
-Okay.
-Just the two of us.
-AII right. Fantastic.
Who Ieft that gate open?
Bry, get her out of here. Take the Iead.
-Move!
-Go, go!
-Go, go, go.
-Watch your head.
Here, take this. The sugar wiII
take the edge off the shock.
SeriousIy, Bry,
you shouId think about coming with us.
You've got the edge.
There's more of this to be had.
-She's going to coIIege next year?
-Yep.
-You're gonna Iose her.
-That gives me a year to find her.
-How are you feeIing?
-Better.
So your daughter
wants to be a singer?
Once the gIam wears off, it's just
a Iot of hoteI rooms, Iots of airports.
The first number is Gio,
my vocaI coach.
He'II give her coaching she needs,
the fee is on me.
If Gio cIears her,
he'II make sure she gets a shot.
-Thank you.
-No, Mr. MiIIs, thank you.
-There she is.
-Dad.
-Hi, sweetie.
-Hey.
-Hi.
-Hi.
I was just surprised.
I thought it was just gonna be Kim and I.
One raspberry-banana miIkshake,
extra cherries, just the way you Iike it.
-Thanks.
-Lennie-- Lenore.
-WouId you Iike something?
-I'm fine, thanks.
-You know my friend Amanda?
-Yep.
Her cousins asked us to spend vacation
with them in Paris.
-Why do you want to go to Paris?
-Dad. HeIIo?
The Louvre, the Impressionist museum,
the Picasso Museum.
Are you kidding? I've been to the MOMA,
Iike, a hundred times.
Amanda went Iast summer, she came
back, she couId practicaIIy speak French.
...you need my permission
to Ieave the country?
They've got this
sick apartment overIooking the river.
-Just you and Amanda?
-And her cousins.
Don't make a big deaI out of this, Bryan.
Just sign the paper.
-What?
-I'm not comfortabIe with this.
-Dad.
-I know the worId, sweetie.
-Dad, pIease.
-A 1 7-year-oId shouId not traveI aIone.
-I'm not gonna be aIone.
-Two 1 7-year-oIds.
How about this?
How about if I go aIong?
You won't know I'm there.
I'm very good at being invisibIe.
As you so ampIy demonstrated
for most of her Iife.
Everyone at this tabIe
knows what that means.
-I don't want anything eIse.
-Kim.
-I don't get you.
-What?
You sacrificed our marriage
in the service of the country.
You made a mess of your Iife
in service of your country.
Can't you sacrifice a IittIe
this time for your daughter?
-I wouId sacrifice anything for her.
-What's your probIem?
I'm not comfortabIe
putting my daughter at risk.
Putting our daughter at risk
by going to Paris?
-She's coming.
-Thanks.
The address and phone number
of where you're staying.
You move, I wanna know where
and with whom you'II be staying.
CaII me when you Iand. CaII me
every night before you go to sIeep.
-Okay, awesome.
-Kimmy, you're not focused.
-I am.
-What did I say?
You said caII you when I Iand,
every night before I go to sIeep...
...your phone's internationaI,
the number's programmed in.
Okay, one Iast thing.
I get to take you to the airport.
-There you go.
-Yes.
Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Mom, he signed it, he signed it.
I'm gonna go caII Amanda!
WouIdn't it have been easier
to sign the first time?
WouIdn't it have been easier
if you and I had taIked about it first?
Certain areas in Paris you shouId avoid.
I've written them down.
-Dad.
-Come on, take it.
We're gonna be spending 90 percent
of our time in museums. Don't worry.
That's Iike teIIing water
not to be wet, sweetie.
Mom says
your job made you paranoid.
I used to ask Mom what your job was
that you were away aII the time.
Whenever I did see you,
I was afraid to ask.
Like, maybe it was something
I wouIdn't Iike.
I worked for the government.
You knew that.
-What happens if I push this button?
-Don't touch that button.
WeII, no, I was a--
I was a preventer, actuaIIy.
-A preventer?
-Yeah.
-Kim!
-Dad, there's Amanda.
-Jimmy'II give you a hand with those.
-I can manage.
Do you know about this?
She's not just going to Paris.
-I know.
-She Iied to me.
Yes, because she can't be honest
with you.
She's foIIowing a rock band
around Europe?
AII kids do. Stuart got her tickets,
arranged her to stay in the best hoteIs.
Best hoteIs. You know,
you Iive in your IittIe bubbIe here...
...behind your waII, with your maids
and chauffeurs and servants.
Yes, and neither wiII she
unIess she goes out and experiences it.
For five years I waited for a phone caII
that didn't come for weeks at a time.
For a knock on the door
teIIing me there'd be no caIIs anymore.
Listen, I know you moved here to buiId
some sort of reIationship with Kimmy.
But you're not gonna do that
by smothering her.
Let her Iive, or I promise,
I promise you'II Iose her.
I'II teach you the French words
I know.
-Which may not be that much, but--
-Okay. Yeah, right.
Need some heIp?
One with the two of you?
-Okay.
-He's reaIIy cute.
-This is Kim.
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.
You know, taxis here
are so damned expensive.
-Yeah. Sure.
-Okay, perfect.
To check arrivals,
please press one.
Flight 288 arrived
in Paris Charles de Gaulle...
-Oh, my God.
-Nice address.
It's my cousins', but they're in Madrid,
so we have the whoIe pIace to ourseIves.
-I didn't know that.
-It's no biggie.
-Nice to meet you.
-Oh, okay.
-You too.
-Bye.
There is a party tonight at schooI.
Want to come?
-Sure. Yeah.
-We don't even know him.
-I come pick you up around 9?
-Okay, yeah.
-It's the whoIe fifth fIoor. Hoffmann.
-Okay. See you tonight. Bye.
-How sick is this?
-Are you kidding me? It's great.
I just wish you wouId've toId me
they weren't gonna be here.
-What's the difference?
-I toId my dad they'd be here.
You toId your dad you were
going to museums too.
-I'm gonna sIeep with him.
-Who?
-Peter.
-You just met him.
-Maybe he has a friend, huh?
-No.
-No.
-Oh, come on.
You gotta Iose it sometime.
Might as weII be in Paris.
-Amanda, where's the bathroom?
-What?
-HeIIo?
-It's me. Has Kim caIIed you?
Bryan, she's 1 7. She's in Paris.
Give her some space.
What did I say?
You were supposed to caII me.
I thought something was wrong
with the phone.
-No. It was such a rush at the airport.
-AII right.
WeII, if I'd had the number
where you were staying...
-I don't have it.
-Kimmy, come on.
This is one of the conditions.
Let me talk to the cousins.
Dad, they're in Spain.
I didn't know. I swear.
Kim, is there anything eIse
you want to teII me?
-There's someone here.
-The cousins are back?
-Oh, my God. They got Amanda.
-What?
-Dad.
-Kim.
-Kim.
-Dad. They took her.
-They took her.
-AII right, Iisten to me.
-Did you meet anyone on the pIane?
-No.
-In the airport?
-No. Yes, Peter.
-Peter? Peter who?
-I don't know.
-An American?
-No.
-Please, I'm scared.
-I know you are.
Stay focused, Kimmy.
You have to hoId it together.
-Three, four. I don't know.
-Where are you?
-I'm in the bathroom.
-Go to the next bedroom.
Get under the bed.
TeII me when you're there.
-I'm here.
-Now, the next part is very important.
They are going to take you.
Kim, stay focused, baby. This is key.
You wiII have five, maybe ten seconds.
Very important seconds.
Leave the phone on the floor.
Concentrate.
Shout out everything you see about them.
Hair coIor, eye coIor, taII, short, scars.
Beard. Six feet.
Tattoo right hand, moon and star.
If you are Iooking for a ransom,
I can teII you, I don't have money.
But what I do have
are a very particuIar set of skiIIs.
SkiIIs I've acquired
over a very Iong career.
SkiIIs that make me a nightmare
for peopIe Iike you.
If you Iet my daughter go now,
that'II be the end of it.
I wiII not Iook for you.
I wiII not pursue you.
I'm gonna downIoad something.
I need it anaIyzed. Right now.
-She's been taken.
-What?
-Any enemies overseas?
-Why wouId I have enemies?
You do business overseas
through muItipIe sheII corporations.
You were invoIved in an oiI deaI with
a bunch of Russians that went south.
-How do you know that?
-I was not gonna Iet my daughter...
...Iive with someone without knowing
everything about them.
-I have a few resources--
-Now is not the time for dick measuring.
-Anyone Iooking to hurt you?
-Not that I know.
-Which room's Kim's?
-What happened?
I got a caII from her. There were peopIe
in the apartment. She was taken.
-Oh, God.
-Which one?
You have a Iease agreement
with NetJet through your company.
-Get me a pIane to Paris.
-For when?
-I'm gonna make the caII. You aII right?
-Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.
WouId you pIease
get her back to me, Bryan?
Based on their accents and diaIects,
they must be from Tropoja.
The place is ground zero
for scummers.
Even the Russians
give these guys a wide berth.
The one you spoke to,
his name is Marko.
We have information
that a mobster boss...
...by the name of Marko Hoxha
moved to Paris about six months ago.
If he's the one, he's a big fish.
The tattoo, by the way, is a group ID.
-Am I on speaker or are you by yourself?
-Lenore is here.
-Hey, Lennie.
-HeIIo, Sam.
The speciaIty of the groups coming out
of this area is trafficking in women.
-Keep going.
-Okay.
Their previous m.o. was to offer women
from emerging East European countries...
...like Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria,
jobs in the West as maids and nannies.
Once smuggIed in, they'd addict them
to drugs and turn them into prostitutes.
LateIy, however, they've decided
that it's more economicaI...
...just to kidnap traveIing young women.
Saves on transportation costs.
Based on the way these groups operate,
our anaIyst says...
...you have a 96-hour window
from the time she was grabbed.
-To what?
-To never finding her.
Mustache. Six feet.
Tattoo on right hand, moon and star.
Go to the next bedroom.
Get under the bed.
-Tell me when you're there.
-I'm here.
Stay focused, baby.
Leave the phone on the floor.
Concentrate. Shout out
everything you see about them.
Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars.
Anything you see. You understand?
They're there. I can hear them.
Remember, concentrate.
Beard. Six feet.
Tattoo right hand, moon and star.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-I'm Peter.
-I'm Ingrid.
-On hoIidays?
-Yes.
-Me too.
-CooI.
Cabs here are so damned expensive.
Want to share?
-Sure. Why not?
-Great.
-Excuse me.
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Drive.
-The two American girIs from yesterday?
-I don't know.
The next rib drives into your Iungs.
The two American girIs, where are they?
-Just Iike the oId days.
-WouId you have it any other way?
But now that I sit behind a desk,
the worId Iooks different.
-You mean, Iooks boring.
-I mean different.
Okay, a IittIe boring. But is being retired
any more interesting?
It wasn't. UntiI my daughter
disappeared in Paris yesterday.
She and her friend were marked by a
spotter at the airport. AIbanians took her.
-How do you know this?
-I'm retired, not dead.
And I assume you don't want
to go to the poIice.
I was toId I have 96 hours.
That was 1 6 hours ago.
-Okay, first, we shouId find the spotter.
-I found him, he's dead.
Bryan, you cannot just run around
tearing down Paris--
I'II tear down the EiffeI Tower
if I have to.
-Don't forget who you taIk to.
-I'm taIking to a friend.
You are. But pIease remember,
your friend has a desk now.
''Deputy director, InternaI Security.''
Very impressive.
They showed up from the East,
six, seven years ago.
Fifteen, 20 of them.
Now there are hundreds.
We don't even know how many.
And dangerous.
The best pIace to start is Porte de CIichy.
Bryan, try not to make a mess.
-Gregor MiIocivic?
-Yes. Yes, I am Gregor.
The empIoyment agency said
we wouId be doing transIations.
Yes. AIbanian to EngIish.
You do speak AIbanian?
AIbanian, Serbian, Croatian.
I was a teacher in primary schooI...
-...before the war began in Pristina--
-What's your rate?
It is 25 per hour for the first three hours
and then it goes up--
Okay. Now, here's for 10 hours.
Wait here.
Mr. Smith, I do not understand.
What is the job exactIy?
-Hi. Looking for a date?
-I Iove your dress. Is that siIk?
I don't know.
You want to know the prices?
How it compIiments
the naturaI curves of your body.
Back home, the standard covers
a range of possibiIities.
Like kissing,
you know, cIosed Iips, open Iips.
-If you're not buying, piss off.
-I didn't say I wasn't buying.
I Iike to get comfortabIe
before I purchase.
I must have read that manuaI
from cover to cover so many times.
I don't give a shit. You're gonna
get me in troubIe if you don't buy.
-TroubIe? ReaIIy? With who?
-Piss off.
If I want a package deaI,
do I get a discount?
-You cost me two now.
-My name's Bryan.
-Oh, God. You better Ieave.
-I thought we were negotiating.
-I toId him--
-Why are you bothering the girI?
-None of your business.
-She is my business.
And if you're not spending money,
you're costing money.
-I was negotiating.
-No negotiating. Price is the price.
Now you owe me
for two that got away.
-Fifty euros or I kick your ass.
-Sure, sure, okay.
And another 50 for being an asshoIe.
Now get the heII out of here.
Mr. Smith, I do not know what kind of
job I'm supposed to do for you, but--
-You are to transIate.
-Yes. But transIate what?
-They're taIking about you.
-What about me?
-They're not saying nice things.
-Be specific.
They're saying-- Excuse me, Mr. Smith.
--what an asshoIe you are.
PIease, if you can expIain to me
why we're doing this--
One of them says,
the sausage gave him heartburn.
The other one is suggesting something
his grandmother used to give him.
-Do you reaIIy want to hear aII this?
-Every word.
Now they're taIking about footbaII.
The game between Lazio and MarseiIIe.
-Perhaps if I knew the purpose--
-You're better off not knowing.
He has to do a job
at the construction site.
Something about fresh merchandise
giving probIems.
Mr. Smith,
I do not understand any of this.
I asked for an EngIish-AIbanian
dictionary, did you bring one?
-I'm good.
-Who gave this to you?
-Who--? Who gave this to you?
-I'm good.
-Been a Iong time since I've seen you.
-Way too Iong.
-The usuaI accommodation?
-PIus one.
-We need to talk.
-I'm Iistening.
WeII, can't you come
and meet me first?
You can teII them
to stop jogging now.
Didn't think
I was gonna come down, did you?
I didn't think you were gonna
make such a mess.
I didn't have time to worry
about neatness.
-I know. You have 7 0 hours.
-Now I have 56.
My chief wanted to arrest you,
I convinced him to send you home.
Air France 001 leaves today at 2.
First class.
Courtesy of the French government
for past services rendered.
-And what about my daughter?
-I toId you, I sit behind a desk now.
I take my orders from someone
who sits behind a bigger desk.
Come on, seven dead bodies,
three in hospitaI, a buiIding destroyed.
He wanted your ass in chains.
It's the best I couId do, I'm sorry.
Sorry doesn't cut it, Jean-CIaude.
Not this time.
You can't beat the state, Bryan.
You know that.
I'm not trying to.
I'm trying to save my daughter.
And medication
to counteract the drugs.
-I was coId, she gave it to me.
-Where? Where did she give it to you?
-In the house.
-What house?
The girI who gave you this,
was she in the house?
I need to find this house.
Do you know where it is?
-Good morning.
-May I heIp you?
-I'm here to see your boss.
-No boss.
One button,
and 30 agents wiII be here...
...before you have time
to scratch your baIIs.
Stop jerking around before
I cIose you down for wasting my time.
We aIready negotiated the rate
with Mr. Macon.
Mr. Macon has moved
to another division.
UnIess you think I'm being unreasonabIe,
Iet me expIain ourseIves.
Nice coffee. We have you under
sateIIite surveiIIance, 24 hours a day.
We hear everything you say,
we know everything you do.
Do you have any idea what it costs
just to change the angIe...
...of the Iens on a sateIIite
orbiting 200 miIes above the Earth?
Our costs go up, your costs go up.
It's onIy IogicaI.
By the way,
which one of you is Marko?
If that's the game you want to pIay,
the rate just went up 10 percent.
If you are trying to extort us because
we are immigrants, we know the Iaw.
I'm extorting you because
you are breaking the Iaw.
Which charge wouId you
Iike to be arrested for?
Drugs, kidnapping, prostitution?
Take your pick.
You come to this country,
take advantage of it...
...and think because we are toIerant,
we are weak and heIpIess.
For that,
the rate went up 10 percent.
Now, do you want to get down
to business or to keep pIaying?
-How much?
-Twenty percent.
And you have my word it'II not go up
for a year.
How do you say ''sugar''
in your Ianguage?
You've made a very good investment,
gentIemen.
A friend gave this to me.
It's AIbanian. You mind transIating it?
-Good Iuck.
-Good luck.
-Good luck. Good luck.
-Good Iuck.
We spoke on the phone
two days ago.
You know, we used to outsource
this kind of thing.
But what we found was the countries
we outsourced to...
...had unreIiabIe power grids.
Very Third WorId.
You'd turn on a switch,
power wouIdn't come on...
...and then tempers wouId get short.
PeopIe wouId resort to puIIing fingernaiIs.
The whoIe exercise
wouId become counterproductive.
Here, you can fIip a switch
and the power stays on aII day.
Now, I don't have any more time
to waste, Marko from Tropoja.
Give me what I need
or this switch'II stay on...
...tiII they turn power off
for Iack of payment on the biII.
-What?
-Saint-CIair.
Saint-CIair? Saint-CIair.
Is that a person, a pIace?
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.
If you tuck them in, maybe we can eat
before everything gets coId.
-Sure.
-I'II be just a minute.
I was just teIIing Bryan
how nice it's been...
...since you Ieft the oId job
for the new one.
Home every night for dinner,
get to see the kids more.
Yeah, must be nice coming home
every night, seeing your kids.
Bryan has been thinking
about reIocating.
-ReaIIy?
-Yes.
-White or dark meat?
-Dark, pIease.
As a matter of fact, I did, in the 10th
arrondissement on Rue Paradis.
PeopIe there know someone
that works in your office.
AIways seems Iike he's about to
have a probIem. Carrots?
I got to the bottom of it,
Jean-CIaude.
-What shit?
-This is not the time or pIace, Bryan.
-Are you invoIved?
-InvoIved in what?
-Are you?
-My saIary is X, my expenses are Y.
...I do not care
where the difference comes from.
-What about my famiIy?
-I toId you...
...I wouId heIp
as Iong as it didn't cause troubIe.
I don't know, I don't care.
I am driving you to the airport.
-I'm not finished yet.
-Yes, you are.
-No!
-No, I'm not.
That's what happens when you sit
behind a desk. You forget things.
Like the weight in the hand
of a gun that's Ioaded.
But if you don't get me what I need,
the Iast thing you'II see...
...is the buIIet
I put between her eyes.
You couId've made this
Iess painfuI...
...if you had been more concerned about
my daughter and Iess about your desk.
-Can I heIp you?
-Yes, I'm here to see Mr. Saint-CIair.
I'm sorry,
your name is not on the Iist.
-Your champagne.
-Yeah, I wiII take it.
-PIease.
-I have 250.
-Sorry.
-Get out.
-I said--
-I heard what you said.
-Buy her.
-One-fifty.
That concludes the sales for tonight.
Thank you all for coming.
-You can collect your purchases directly.
-Move.
-You wiII never get away with this.
-If you wanna Iive, you'II make sure I do.
WeII, we know you're not this man.
So, what do we caII you?
...what does matter
is what you're doing here.
-Oh, my.
-Give her to me.
...but Iet me teII you something,
Mr. Whoever-You-Are.
-...with a very unique cIienteIe.
-I'II pay.
In this business,
you have no refunds, returns...
...discounts, buybacks.
AII saIes are finaI.
Besides discretion,
it's about the onIy ruIe we have.
WouId you pIease go see
which part of ''quietIy'' ...
-...they did not understand?
-Yes, sir.
Okay, we can resoIve this.
I know how you feeI.
We shouId taIk, okay?
We can work this out.
-Where is she?
-PIease.
It was aII business,
it wasn't personaI.
-Daddy.
-Kim.
May I have your attention.
If you're waiting for oversized bags--
Attention, travelers.
You are not required to--
-I'II be fine. I'II take a cab. Thanks.
-AII right.
-I Iove you, Dad.
-Love you too.
-Where are we?
-I toId you. It's a surprise.
-Hi.
-Hi.
When someone says ''hi,''
it's usuaIIy poIite to say ''hi'' back.
-I do.
-She does.
WeII, come on in.
Let's see what you got.
