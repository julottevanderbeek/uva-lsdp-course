Charlie!
I wasn't so sure you'd be on the bus.
Didn't want your white brothers
thinking you were the best we had.
SOLOMON ISLANDS
Watch out!
My hand!
Goddamn!
We're running out of ammo.
We gotta get out of here.
Move!
Come on!
Come on, you can do it! Come on!
We got nothin', Enders!
We're out of ammo!
Joe... Nobody else needs to die.
We can go! We can get outta here!
We got orders!
They told us to hold the position!
And that's what we're gonna do!
Get up, marine!
Hold the goddamn position!
Come on!
Get down!
Tommy.
Goddamn you!
Oh, no! No!
- Bill!
- I'm out.
Come on! Come on!
Goddamn you, Joe Enders.
No... No!
No!
Raise your right hand.
- I... State your full name...
- l, Ben Yahzee...
CAMP PENDLETON, CALIFORNIA
...do solemnly swear to support and
defend the constitution of the US...
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...
Jap Ha-Go. Who can give me
the code word for "tank"?
Come on. You boys
wanna be codetalkers.
Show me some brains. Think!
What do we call a tank?
Chay-da-gahi.
Tortoise. Good.
Artillery. Code word?
In code. Private Whitehorse.
Be-al-doh-tso-lani?
Very good.
Japanese Zero. Code word?
KANEOHE BAY US NAVAL HOSPITAL
We can go! We can get outta here!
They told us to hold the position!
Nice day, huh?
Joe?
Joe.
Didn't hear a word, did you?
That's what happens to a man
when he's talking to a beautiful woman.
It happens when you're
not watching my lips, Joe.
Watch this.
You're a mess, Joe.
You're not fooling anybody.
No, Rita. He's a mess.
I'm getting better every day.
You got a perforated eardrum, Enders.
Your equilibrium's all screwy.
You can't go back to war
if you can't stand up.
Let's go, marines. This war
ain't gonna wait forever. Let's go.
Joe...
Why don't you just stay here, Joe?
Somebody's gotta keep
the WAVES company.
Are you gonna help me or not?
Marked improvement.
And his left ear is the worse of the two?
It's... amazing.
TBYhasn't got the range of the TBX.
So you may need a relay to get
your transmission to command post.
But what it really comes down to
is speed and accuracy under pressure.
Transcribe now.
Victor, Victor. This is X-ray. Over.
Damn it! We got a unit under fire!
We're losing men.
I need this message decrypted.
"Request fire support. We have target
at one-one-niner, Baker one-five."
"Pillbox with heavy machine gun.
Fire at will."
Beginner's luck.
You're up, mac.
- Corporal Enders reporting, sir.
- At ease.
You've done well as a marine, Corporal.
Better than you did as a civilian.
Stole a motorbike, crashed it.
Got kicked out of high school.
Assault and battery...
on one Father Crispin O'Donnell?
A priest?
Assistant principal at Archbishop Keenan
High School, sir, and head disciplinarian.
Public-school boy myself.
Some minor problems in boot.
A commendation for valor in Shanghai.
And you made a hell of a stand
on the Solomons.
Tough bit of business there, huh?
Pretty tough, sir.
But you're prepared
to jump right back into it?
Yes, sir. Very much so.
Very much so.
Well...
The Japs have pretty much busted
every code we've thrown at 'em, Corporal.
You men on the Solomons
were lost to a broken code.
Tell me something. You ever
run into any Indians on the Solomons?
- Indians, sir?
- Navajo, to be exact.
The Corps has developed a new code
based on their language.
It's had quite an impact.
So much so the navy have decided
to go to great lengths to protect it.
That's why you're here.
You're to pair with one of them,
keep his ass safe.
Your job is to keep him alive
so he can do his job.
Begging the major's pardon, but I believe
I'd best serve the Corps killing Japs,
not baby-sitting some Indian.
Enders, we didn't pick
your name out of a hat.
We need good marines.
That's why you're standing here.
Take a look.
It's a Navajo. Or it was.
Tortured to death by Japanese
intelligence trying to bust our code.
Fortunately, he couldn't help them
even if he wanted to.
- Sir?
- Man's a Navajo, not a codetalker.
Code's based on their language,
but it is still a code.
Tojo would like nothing more
than to catch a live one.
What I'm about to tell you, Corporal,
cannot leave this room.
Under no circumstances can you allow
your codetalker to fall into enemy hands.
Your mission is to protect the code...
at all costs.
You understand me?
Yes, sir, I do.
Good.
Congratulations. You just made sergeant.
Keep those hands vertical.
Way to go, marine.
Fortino, take over.
Hey... That was you, right,
sitting in front of the major's office?
Yeah. Listen, I'm Pete Henderson.
They call me Ox.
Not cos of my big muscles or anything.
I'm from Oxnard, California.
Just north of Hollywood a ways.
So you're with JASCO too, huh?
Hey, know where we might find
Hey, know where we might find
No fuckin' idea, mac.
Thanks. Thanks a bunch.
I've never seen so many white men.
They've never seen so many Navajo.
Looks to me like you got to see
a little action there.
Me too.
Jap sons of bitches
shot me right in the ass.
You believe that shit?
I wasn't running or nothin'.
So, your duty with JASCO have anything
to do with these Navajo radiomen?
I'm not at liberty to say.
I see you got a new stripe there. Me too.
So I'm guessing the orders you can't tell
me are the same orders I can't tell you.
Hell of a thing, huh?
Ain't a democracy, Sergeant.
It's the marines.
Yeah.
They look pretty normal, I guess.
Expecting them to wear war paint?
Maybe we ought to go introduce
ourselves. They look a little lost to me.
Henderson.
I wouldn't get too friendly.
How!
Just kiddin'. I'm Ox.
Whitehorse.
This is Yahzee. Ben.
- Next.
- Beautiful. Beautiful.
Close your eyes. It'll taste better.
Who's next?
Mind if I join you?
I'm Ben Yahzee.
Guess the Corps paired us up.
How you doin'?
You're blocking my view.
Oh, sorry.
What do they call this crap anyway?
Marines call it chow.
Well, there's a propaganda effort.
Sorry. You can have mine.
Shit.
What'd you say your name was again,
Private?
It's Yahzee. Ben Yahzee.
Hold this.
Shit.
How's your white man?
Hungry.
I'm in for a couple more.
You writing to your son?
Tell him I say hello.
Pair of cowboys for Big E.
- Possible straight for the Greek.
- Possible thumb up the Greek's ass.
Oh, a pair of twos for the kid.
Lookin' good.
- Oh, come on!
- Now there's a bold move.
All right.
OK... Oh, another mess
for the Sunshine State.
- What, are you mad at me?
- Just want your money.
Hey! Look at that. A trio of nines. Pretty.
- You shuffle that deck?
- I certainly did.
Nines bets. I'll raise it two bits.
Call.
We all got thumbs up our asses.
You won't for much longer. I got a buddy
in Intel that says we ship out in a week.
I been hearing "next week" for a month.
I didn't know you knew
anybody in Intelligence, Harri.
Next year'd be all right with me.
Gentlemen, read 'em and weep.
Look at that. Nines and fours.
Full boat, baby.
Cowboys over queens. Read 'em and die.
Oh, Jesus!
Ouch. Ouch.
- Fuck it. I'm out.
- Yeah. I'm gonna go write the missus.
God knows what a girl will do
without reassurance.
Son of a bitch.
Hey, looks like we got a coupla seats
opening up. You wanna come join us?
Are you serious?
What, Injun poker?
Hey, how do you boys do that again?
Card on the head,
only fool can't see it is you.
You want to come on over, or what?
Cut me in.
I'm thinkin' Fiery Cross, high-low,
hoggers OK, ace plays both ways...
I'm thinkin' Fiery Cross, high-low,
hoggers OK, ace plays both ways...
Hey, don't let him scare you.
If you've ever played a high-low game, it's
like any other. Waste of time and money.
Well, ante up... Chief.
How'd you know I was a chief?
You must've seen me showering
with my war bonnet.
- Deal 'em up, deal 'em up.
- You know, we don't take wampum here.
Beautiful.
All right, then.
Orders finally came through.
We ship out tomorrow morning.
Destination: the island of Saipan,
which is one of the stepping stones
we gotta take on our road show to Tokyo.
It's of strategic importance
that we capture this island.
We can get ourselves
an advanced naval base
and an airstrip to land and refuel B-29's
and get our bombers
within range of Tokyo.
Now, Saipan is Japanese soil,
and there's 30,000 of 'em dug in.
They're gonna fight for every square inch,
because it's their home,
but we're gonna take it away from 'em!
Yeah! Kill me some Japs!
We're gonna be in front
of the whole damn division.
We're gonna be the eyes and the ears.
We're gonna be
sniffin' out enemy positions,
coordinating the naval gunfire -
exactly what we've been training to do
for the last four months. All right?
Now, we got some new radiomen
from headquarters.
There's a Private Whitehorse...
and Yahzee...
and a couple of sergeants,
Enders and Henderson,
who, if I'm understanding
these orders correctly,
will be covering our Navajos' asses.
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!
...but I'm tellin' you, we'll be steppin'
into our share of the shit nonetheless.
Any questions?
Sounds like you're dying.
These might help get rid of the taste.
Charlie and l, we both lost it
on the boat ride from San Diego.
Not many bodies of water in Arizona.
Life Savers really helped.
You want a Life Saver?
What are you doin' here?
Just trying to help.
Not what I meant.
You mean what am I doing
in this uniform?
It's my war too, Sergeant.
I'm fighting for my country,
for my land, for my people.
Not your people I'm worried about.
Listen, Enders, I'm a codetalker.
It takes me two-and-a-half minutes
to do what used to take an hour.
Now, somebody wearing
a lot more stripes than you
thinks that's worth something.
Remind me to time you when
you got bullets flying over your head.
What the hell's wrong with you?
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Early in the morning!
From the halls of Montezuma
To the shores of Tripoli
We will fight our country's battles
On the land and on the sea
First to fight for right and freedom
And to keep our honor clean
We are proud to claim the title
Of United States Marines
Hi.
How's that ear?
Not that you'd ever admit it, but if
it starts aching, take a couple of those.
And call me in the morning.
You're not gonna be here
in the morning, are you?
Shipping out without even
buying me a drink.
Ought to be ashamed of yourself,
hustling a... hustling marines.
What's your poison?
Jeez, might as well go all out.
I'll get a shot of something.
Rum.
Eddie, give me a shot of Bacardi.
Make that two.
May as well join me, huh?
- Why not?
- OK.
Thank you.
Well... to war.
THE JAPANESE ISLAND OF SAIPAN
JUNE 16, 1944
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Get those men spread out!
Charlie, come on, come on, come on!
Come on, keep up!
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Come on!
- How am I doin'?
- You're good.
Let's go!
Stay on my ass.
I told you to stay on my ass!
- Stay low!
- Get out of there!
Go!
Get him outta there!
Get me outta here!
- Hold still, damn it!
- Get him outta there!
You sons of bitches!
Fortino! Cover me!
Whitehorse, get down!
Get down!
Pappas!
Corpsman!
Helmet goes on your head! Corpsman!
Take care of him.
Put a hand on this.
Tank! Tank! Tank!
You ready? Go! Go!
Harrigan, light it up!
Let's go, boys! Keep up the fight!
Are you hit? Are you hit?
You're OK. You're good, you're good.
- Are you OK, Chick?
- Still in the hunt, Gunny.
- Harri?
- You ain't gettin' rid of me that easy.
- Stay low!
- Nellie? Pappas?
Yeah, we're good.
Greek's predisposed to hyperventilate.
What?
I can't breathe when I get excited.
Goddamn! Must be hell on your gal!
Enders, get the navy on the horn
and tell 'em to dig out those guns.
Target reference... dog one...
right 700.
Elevation zero-five-zero.
Relay the damn coordinates!
Arizona! Arizona!
USS CALIFORNIA
It sounds like they're underwater.
Is it English?
Target reference, dog one,
south 700, elevation zero-five-zero.
Right 200!
Up 50. Fire for effect.
Let's go!
Move!
Harrigan!
Torch the box!
Kill him!
Goddamn it!
Shit.
Nellie. Take the satchel charge.
You hear me? Move!
You're gonna cover me, right?
I'll go with you. We flank left.
I'll cover you. Smoke and cover.
I can do this.
I can do this.
Smoke 'em up!
Cover up.
Shit!
Shit. Goddamn Nipponese touchdown!
Heads up around 0500.
You're going to have replacements
and ammo coming up. Over.
Roger. Make sure
they have the new password.
Challenge: "Wind." Answer: "Talkers."
That's what one of our Navajo brothers
calls us. What do you think? Over.
"Windtalkers," I like it. OK, Kemo Sabe,
keep your butts down tonight. Over.
Biscuits? How can you ruin biscuits?
You are a whiny son of a bitch
right now, aren't you?
that make it on the East Coast?
How the fucking hell should I know?
Just seven...
It's 8am, Sunday morning.
I hope my side of the bed
didn't get taken up Saturday night.
Nell, you'll give yourself an ulcer,
you keep worrying about her.
Might get my ass
sent back to Rhody, though.
There's plenty of dollies outside
of Rhode Island, Nell. Many plenty.
- Well, there sure as shit ain't any here.
- Ain't that the truth.
That's cos they're all in Daytona Beach.
The most beautiful women in the world.
This one time, before the war,
I'm lyin' on the beach and this sweet little
thing named Molly comes out the water.
She walks straight up to me
and asks me if I'm hungry...
cos she's havin' a weenie roast.
Shit! Damn.
Yeah, me and Molly, oh boy.
Now I'm on Saipan with this
giant Zippo strapped to my back
and I'm roastin' human beings.
Why I volunteered... beyond me.
Damn, I'm proud to be here.
My whole family's been in the Corps.
My old man, he's a lifer.
An ass-kicker on the land and on the sea.
Around the house too.
Maybe now he'll back off.
Pappas, I...
I want you to do me a favor.
If anything should happen to me,
you make sure that my wife gets this.
I mean, she picked them out and all.
Don't talk like that, Nell.
You don't even joke about shit like that.
Now you put that ring back on.
You're goin' home.
Hey.
Don't thank me till you've tried it.
You missed mail call.
What the hell are they doin'?
I don't know.
They've been doin' it since sundown.
Sounds like some kind of prayer.
Maybe they know our orders.
Think you could do it, Joe?
Give it a rest, Henderson.
Give it a rest? I keep tryin', but...
I'm here to kill Japs, not marines.
I saw you a warrior, Yahzee...
You will make your family proud.
What the hell you think you're doin', boy?
Getting on my uniform.
You know the difference
between you and a Jap, Yahzee?
It's that uniform.
That's it.
See, I know you people.
I know what kind
of slanty-eyed savage you are, boy.
You ought to be careful out here all alone.
No baby-sitter.
I might just take you for a Jap.
You gonna let me get dressed, Chick?
Or keep demonstrating
what an ignorant fool you are?
How's that for an ignorant fool?
Go ahead, try again.
You gonna do somethin'?
Chick! Come on!
Get off me!
- You OK, Ben?
- Yeah.
Ben? Shit.
I thought he was a Jap. You know,
killed some marine for that uniform.
Sure you did, Chick.
Damn Injun looks just like
a Jap, don't he?
Look, I'm no damn Injun.
I'm Navajo, of the Bitter Water People,
born for the Towering House clan.
But you do look like a Nip.
Next time you decide to take a bath,
Private, let me know, or I'll kick your ass.
Fuckin' shitbird.
Supposed to be with a baby-sitter
all the time, I thought.
Out here huntin' salmon and shit.
That ceremony you saw last night?
It's called a protection ceremony.
Navajo believe, until a body's given
a proper burial, the spirits stay near it.
Chindis - that's what
we call evil spirits. Demons.
I haven't thought much about it
since I was a kid.
Till I saw those dead bodies.
You telling me you saw ghosts, Private?
No, Sergeant. I'm telling you
I won't freeze up again.
No, Sergeant. I'm telling you
I won't freeze up again.
Because your buddy
smeared ash on your forehead?
That's right. Cos my buddy
smeared ash on my forehead.
You ever see ghosts?
No more stupid questions today, Private.
That's an order.
Sounds beautiful.
You, uh, you self-taught?
My dad was always playing.
You know what they say:
if you can't beat 'em...
No shit. My dad, he...
he gave me this thing.
Used to call me the Pied Piper of the Pigs.
Used to bring 'em in for feeding
with this little tune I played.
I know I ain't gonna get you
to quit playin' that thing, so...
like you just said, if you can't beat 'em...
I don't think it's gonna work.
Well, we ain't got much else
to do out here. What the hell?
OK.
All right, you lead off. I'll follow you.
at 0600 and scout along road 04.
You can expect light resistance
northwest of the palm grove. Over.
Roger. What do you mean, light?
No resistance is light! Over.
Remember, marine, "Ours is not to
question why, ours is but to do or die."
Semper Fi. Over.
Dear Joe, how the hell are you?
Or, given that you're not much of a
writer, should I not expect an answer?
The newspapers say
our boys are doing great.
But I don't think the reporters
have been to Kaneohe Bay Hospital.
I found a stray dog
the other day on Waikiki.
I gave him a bath and took him in.
He reminded me of you - but cuter.
At least he keeps me warm at night.
I try not to think about you. About
what might be happening over there.
But sometimes, when I'm lying in bed,
I can't keep myself
from wondering where you are.
How you're doing.
What the hell you doin'?
Writing a letter to my son.
Forget your orders? No letters out.
Command don't want postmarks
going to the reservation.
Hey! You hear me?
I thought that he might read 'em
when I get home.
What's his name?
Your son.
It's George. George Washington.
George Washington Yahzee.
It's got a bit of a ring to it.
My wife wasn't so sure.
She's a little more traditional.
- Nice-looking family.
- Let's see, Yahz.
Yeah, that George, he's quite a character.
He's got a mind of his own.
Can I try one of those?
- You smoke?
- Not really.
- Dismount!
- Get out of the truck!
Let's go! Let's go!
- Follow me!
- Let's go!
- I'm hit!
- Yahzee!
Yahzee!
I'm hit!
Take it off! It burns!
You're not hit. Just shut up. You're not hit.
- Spread out!
- Move!
- Where the hell are they comin' from?
- From us.
- What?
- They're not Jap guns.
- We're getting shot at by our own guys?
- We're supposed to be on road 04.
- Get the regiment on the horn.
- I can't!
- Tell 'em they're shelling...
- I can't! The radio's out. It's been hit.
- They're firing too short!
- The Japs gotta be way ahead of us.
Do somethin'.
Shit... Follow me!
- We're on the wrong fuckin' road!
- Goddamn it!
God.
Son of a bitch!
I got you, mac!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Nellie!
Corpsman!
You were right, Joe.
I do look like a Nip.
What the hell are you talking about?
Putting on that Jap uniform. Trying to get
one of their radios, call off our guns.
- That's stupid.
- Shut up. Let him talk.
- He's not goin' out there.
- You're not in charge here, Enders.
I got orders, Gunny.
He's my responsibility!
