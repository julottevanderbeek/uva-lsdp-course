The Tartars are coming !

-
-
-
-
-
- They're Northmen ! A boat !
Move ! Move !
Keep moving !
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.
Wait, wait, wait !
Those men in the boat,
who are they ?
The Northmen.
Keep moving and keep quiet !
Why ?
Are they dangerous ?
I am supposed
to talk to people !
You may yet
have the opportunity.
What do you suppose the potentate
of this encampment calls himself?
Oh, emperor,
at the very least.
Hmm. Emperor.
-
-
We seek your--
We seek your headman,
your king.
Try Greek.
Eh ?
He says their king
is out there in that tent.
He says the king
will not speak to us.
Apparently, the king won't
speak to us because he's dead.

" Buliwyf wishes
a song of glory."
Uh--
In the beginning,
the Earth was void,

" We will burn him. In one moment,
he and all he owns can be in paradise.
- To take with him ?

- Lo there do I see my father.

'Lo they do call to me.
where the brave

Another ship arrived
during the night.
There's a boy standing out there
on the bow like he's a statue.
The boy is letting them
see him.
He's in plain sight !
They do not know
if what they see is real.
Something to do
with the mist.
The boy was being polite, giving them
time to decide if he's real.
He comes from their homeland
in the north with a message for Buliwyf.
Look at them. What thing
would affect them so ?
" He calls for
the Angel of Death.
" He calls for the bones.
She's an oracle.
She calls for men,
a number of them.
Thirteen.
The number of months in the year.
She says 1 3 men must go."

-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
Eight.
-
-
-
-
Ten.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
" She says the 1 3th man
must be no Northman."
What the hell
are you saying ?
The 1 3th warrior is you.
-
-
-
-
" He wishes to know
your name."
I am Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan,
Ibn Al Abbas, Ibn Rasid--
- " Eban."
-
Listen. Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan.
Ibn means " son of."
Eban.
Hyah ! Hup !
What is he saying ?
" Hurry to meet death
before your place is taken."
I will not forget you.
Go with God.
You listening ?
-
-
...tomorrow.
-
-
for I will get to know so-proven
aye komin home tonight."

She probably was
some smoke-colored camp girl.
Looked like
that one's mother.
My mother...
was a pure woman...
know who my father is,
pig-eating
son of a whore.
Come on, come on, come on,
come on. Come.
- Come on.
- Where did you learn our language ?
I listened !
You can draw... sounds ?
" Draw sounds" ?
Yes, I can draw sounds,
and I can speak them back.
Show me.
and Muhammad is His prophet.
-
-
- Hey !
- Mind yourself.
Be quiet.
Only an " Arob" ...
would bring--
A dog to war ?
I heard this
the first time.
-
-
-
-
Good going, " Arabe."
-
-
- Come on.
-
- The dog can jump.
-
Here.
- No, no.
- Eat !
Shouldn't we stay
closer to land ?
Odin !
Down.
- What did you-- What is that--
-  Be silent.
Odin !
Land !
There is only one God...
and Muhammad is his...
prophet.
Go.
Here.
- You'll need this.
-
I cannot lift this.
Grow stronger.
Rider.
Well-fed on a light mount.
Perfume.
A woman.
A herald.
It's a silk-swaddled
messenger boy.
Tell me your names !
Quickly !
I am Son to Hygiliak,
called Buliwyf.
We all know
your worthy lord.
We come on an errand
to serve him.
My Lord Hrothgar will want
to welcome you himself.
You couldn't keep a cow
out of this place.
Barely a man
between 1 5 and 50.
and I know him now.
Grown to a man.
What troubles this place,
old man ?
You know
he might be mad.
Be in the mist.
- Has anyone seen one
in a hundred years ?
- Hyah !
They say they used to be
all over this countryside...
and worse further north.
People say many things.
Whatever they are,
unless we can track them,
we need a proper fence
and some sort of moat--
I don't want to build a fence.
I'm not a farmer.
- --
-
-
- Who did this ?
-
- Find someone who knows him.
- Wait !
I know him.
It's a farmstead,
just up the glen.
I will take you.
Don't step
in front of me.
So it's true.
-
-
They have been...
gnawed upon.
It is said
they eat the dead.
Wh-What kind of a man...
could do that ?
It was not man.
- It's the Wendol.
- Shh !
They are here.
What is it ?
- The mother of the Wendol.
-
- The trail ?
- Dies in the rocks, two miles up.
So they are clever.
And cautious.
To the right.
The ridge near the watchtower.
The edge of the trees
near the first ridgeline.
Something drove them out.
Put your hand down,
little brother.
If we chase ?
- They melt.
- Will they come to us ?
The farmers say
they come with the mist.
So, if there's a fog,
they will come.
We are hunted now
in our own land.
-
-
What of the settlements
to the north and upcountry ?
- Two years.
- Two years... ago.
Not for some months.
--
You do not drink tonight ?
No, we don't drink tonight.
But let the dawn come,
and they see the bodies.
This gentleman has the look of a great
warrior. No doubt he's very brave.
But to face the Wen...
he'll need
some amazing luck.
Luck often enough
will save a man,
if his courage hold.
- Who is that man ?
- King's son.
But wait for the Wendol
one night's time...
and then talk to us
of courage.
I thank the lord
for his advice,
though I don't recall
hearing any exploits of his...
apart from killing
his brothers.
These are guests
at what is still my table !
There is a man
who was at Estwyck.
I saw the thing
that did this clear enough !
Teeth like a lion,
head like a bear,
claws that could tear
a plank to kindling.
Always in the darkest, like they
could see in the black.
Did they go on two legs
or four ?
It seems they did both, like a thing
that was both man and bear.
I saw the glowworm, though.
Saw it clear.
We all did on the last night.
My father's father
always warned of it.
Said it was a hate
from old times.
There will be fog.
-
-
I will stand
the watch with you.
My lord, the children
will need protection.
Should they pass us,
then you and yours must stop them.
Luck in battle, boy.
The Old Father wound the skeane
of your life a long time ago.
Go and hide in a hole
if you wish.
Fear profits
man nothing.
-
-
we form a circle
in the center of the room,
backs to one another.
I am not a warrior.
Very soon you will be.
-
-
Well, he didn't run !
Hey.
You appear
none the worse for wear.
- Rognar is here.
- His head ?
No.
They take the heads.
They always take the heads.
It's the same.
-
-
None of them.
None of the ones
we killed.
Nor do I.
Not one.
I took two at least
that could not have lived.
- Even the Arab gutted one.
- There was some life left in him.
They are demons.
Their blood
looks real enough.
- Ow !
- You complain much.
Ow.
-
- What is that ?
Cow urine.
" Cow urine" ?
- Boiled down.
-  No.
No, no, no. Don't put
that filth on me. No, no.
Water.
Clean water.
As you wish.
Tomorrow the pus will run
and you'll have a fever.
Your head has gone
looking for your hands.
They will meet you
in paradise.
is one of their claws.
We have the fences
to build.
Keep 'em comin' down.
Come in here.
Line up there.
You, in here.
You, over here.
-
- Move !
Stand there.
I'll cut this pole.
Keep your eye on the pole,
all right ?
So.
Now you do it.
Aah !
Is there a metal worker ?
He insisted.
Give an Arab a sword,
he makes a knife.
It works.
When you die, can I give that
to me daughter ?
Are you thirsty ?
- Mead ?
- Water.
Thank you.
Aah !
- Ow !
- That's a woman's sound.
Do that again
and you'll make it.
- You'll heal.
-
I think my nose
is ruined.
- A small price.
- Ow !
People are very quiet
today.
- The peasants fear you will
bring the fireworm down on us.
- What ?
The fireworm.
The fire-serpent.
" The fire-serpent."
A dragon ?
I do not believe
in dragons.
Beware of Prince Wigliff.
He poisons
the king's ear,
says your Buliwyf has plans
to take his kingdom.
-
- Is there truth in this ?
No.
You may believe me.
Then be cautious.
- She would say no more.
-
She doesn't need to.
Prince, aah !
Mm-hmm.
I'll do it.
You shouldn't be involved.
- What should I do ?
- Keep your teeth together
and go back to work.
Watch where you throw that.
You dig like a dog.
Did you call me a dog ?
I said you dig like one, flinging
earth carelessly like an animal.
So, now
I'm an animal ?
You're not listening.
I'm deaf?
You're a fool,
little man.
That is because,
your words are feeble...
and twisted
as an old woman's !
This old woman'll send you
to the next world, old man !
- What happened ?
-
An engineering dispute.
- You notice he's bigger than you ?
-
- And younger ?
- Yes.
- Bet on him, if you like.
- I may !
Luck.
Aah !
You must stop it.
- He's going to get killed.
- That is possible.
But you can't--
you can't--
-
-
You stupid fools !
See to your friend.
He was a brave man.
- You--you could have
killed him at will.
- Yes ?
- Wh-wh-why the deception ?
- Deception is the point !
Any fool
can calculate strength.
That one has been doing it
from the moment he saw us.
Now he has to calculate
what he can't see.
And fear what
he doesn't know.
As you say,
foolish and expensive.
We'll miss Angus tonight.
We will miss his sword.
Edgtho ?
Edgtho ?
Stifle your racket.
I hear you.
- I thought to find you in the tower.
- Yeah.
- Why I'm not in it.
-
- It's going to rain.
-
Three miles up
there's a cliff.
Tide's right,
waves make thunder.
Quickly !
No time to waste.
Outside ! Go !
Quickly ! Move !
Come on !
A serpent of fire.
What's that in the field
below the tower ?
- It's a child.
- Look at her.
Open the gate.
Get the gate !
- Open the gate !
- Push !
No ! You need to raise
the spikes first ! Help me !
- Come on !
- Down.
Push it now !
Heave !
So you saw
the fireworm ?
It's cavalry.
- I rather prefer a dragon.
- Hundreds.
Take the north.
Let's go, little brother.
It's beginning.
" Arabe" ! Here !
Guard !
Allah,
be merciful.
I got you !
Ja !
Yeah !
It's a man.
It's a man.
It's a man.
It's a man.
It's a man !
It's a man !
It's all right,
little brother.
- There are more.
-
Aah !
Aah !
- Aah !
- Aah !
Aah !
Aah !
-
- Get 'em over !
Aah !
They've breeched the gate !
Aah !
Aah !
They've breeched the gate !
Fight them !
Turn and fight them !
Aah !
Come on !
Come on !
Ahmed !
What do I do with it ?
Put your foot on it
and stand !
- Aah !
-
Aah !
Aah !
Aah !
Don't !
Aah !
Skeld, Halga, Roneth...
and Rethel will be
joining them.
I cannot...
taste neither
the fermentation of grape...
nor of wheat.
-
- What ?
Why do you
laugh ?
Honey.
It's made from honey.
We will die here.
It is...
possible.
Come.
Come on.
She finish you,
or bring you back to life ?
A gentleman doesn't
discuss such things.
-
-
Looks like the mating
of a man and some beast.
It's a man.
If it sleeps, it has a lair
and we have a trail.
Attack them ?
Is there a choice ?
Come with me.
There is a woman who can help.
Bring the Arab.
She's quite mad.
The perfect advisor.
Oh, Weilew.
Oh.
Shame, shame, shame.
It's a Queen Weilew fronts
me now, does she not ?
We seek your counsel,
Madam.
We or he ?
Step closer, Buliwyf.
You know me ?
I have ears.
"Warrior," says the wind.
But why seek you me ?
Met you your match ?
Met you your match...
We seek your wisdom.
Wars are won in the will.
Perhaps you've been fighting
in the wrong field.
- A thing of them.
- Yes.
Ahh.
They show you the way
you will not see.
Slaughter them
till you rot.
Find the root.
-
- How ?
This is the mother
of the Wen.
She they revere.
She is the will.
Where do I seek her ?
She is the earth.
Seek her in the earth.
He wears
the horns of power.
He, too, you must kill.
Have we anything
resembling a plan ?
A child could
follow this.
They have no fear,
no fear of us at all.
The dog
does not approve.
I don't think
they like company.
The claws.
The headdresses.
Bears.
They think they are bears.
They want us
to think they are bears.
Hey, how do you
hunt a bear ?
Chase it down with dogs.
What--
How do you hunt a bear
in winter ?
Go in his cave
with spears.
Where is a cave ?
It's in the earth.
The next glen,
many fires.
Is there a cave ?
But there's
no cave.
Yes, there is.
-
- Can we get to it ?
If they don't
keep dogs, maybe.
You'd have to
kiss me first, dearie.
Let's go.
Oh, how deep in
the Earth are we ?
- Deep enough to fall out the bottom.
- Come on !
Look at your feet.
I was wrong.
These are not men.
we will have
the other lot on us.
Down the wall,
I go.
- Let's go, little brother.
- I do not enjoy heights.
Stay.
Aah !
Go !
Kill her !
Do it !
- Aah !
-
-
-
Aah !
Damn it !
It is done ?
It is.
A hard fight to get
clear of here ?
I've run about
as far as I care to.
Today was a good day.
A good day.
Get along, lad.
Go.
Helfdane ?
We'll just keep
following this stream.
It has to come out
somewhere.
Stream disappears
under the rocks.
- Buliwyf!
- I'm all right.
We fight by twos.
Give the other pair a chance to rest.
Here they come.
Go on,
make it worse.
Now it's gonna rain.
-
- It's gonna rain. It's gonna rain.
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait !
- Thunder.
- Waves make thunder.
- The thunder cliffs.
- Surf. Surf.
There's a surf
out there.
Try it.
Breathe ! Breathe !
Deep breath !
Now, one, two, three !
The way we'll know is...
if they don't follow us,
it's too far to swim !
-
-
The skeane is tied.
The weave
was settled long ago.
You're wearing that
long face for me ?
I cannot help it.
I have only
these hands.
I will die
a pauper.
You will be buried
as a king.
A man might
be thought wealthy...
that they may be remembered.
Such a man might be
thought wealthy indeed.
He's traveling
to the other side.
He grips his sword
as if afraid he will not wake.
- I'm not tired.
-
The Wendol want vengeance
for killing their mother.
Again ?
We killed the mother
but not the leader.
As long as he lives,
they will come back to fight us.
When ?
Tonight.
The evening
lasts so long here.
I don't think tonight
there will be--
-
- fog.
" Kill the mother,"
she said.
" Kill their leader
and they will break."
We'll soon find out
if she was right.
At least we don't
have to worry about fire.
They're all terrified,
ready to break and run.
I wish we had
Buliwyf with us.
It's a small matter.
Here.
Prepare yourselves.
Merciful Father,
I have squandered my days
with plans of many things.
This was not among them.
But at this moment,
I beg only...
to live the next
few minutes well.
-
- When the time comes.
Don't let them
be taken.
For all we ought
to have thought...
and have not thought,
all we ought to have said...
and have not said,
all we ought to have done...
and have not done,
I pray Thee, God,
for forgiveness.
'Lo there
do I see my father.
-
- Mother and my sisters...
- and my brothers.
-
'Lo there do I see
the line of my people,
back to the beginning.
'Lo they do call to me.
They bid me
take my place among them.
In the halls of Valhalla,
where the brave...
may live...
forever.
Aah !
Aah !
Aah !
Aah !
We shall make prayers
for your safe passage.
Prayers to who ?
I will pray to all of them for you.
Do not be offended.
I'll be in your debt.
Good-bye, Arab !
Good-bye, Northman.
