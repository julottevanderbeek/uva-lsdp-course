-
Ohh!
- You again!
I'm startin' to get insulted
Green Arrow's
Not messin' up
my operations personally.
Uhh!
Do you know what I pay
for a suit in my size?!
Scorch the Earth, boys.
- Uhh!
- Unh!
- Ohh!
-
-
- Hyah!
-
- The cave is perfect.
It has everything
the team will need.
- For covert missions,
you know, spy stuff.
- And wait till you see Superboy
and Miss Martian.
But I saw her first.
-
- Hahh!
- Heh heh.
Tell Arrow he shouldn't
send boys to do a man's job.
Go ahead.
- High-density
polyurethane foam. Nice.
- So, Speedy, you in?
- Pass.
I'm done letting Arrow and
the League tell me what to do.
I don't need a baby sitter
or a clubhouse
To hang out
with the other kids.
Your Junior Justice League
is a joke,
Something to keep you busy
and in your place.
I don't want any part of it.
- Recognized: Robin, b01;
Kid Flash, b03.
- Did you ask him?
What did he say?
- He's arriving now.
- Then what are we waiting for?
- Greetings.
Is there a reason you
intercept me outside the cave?
- We hoped you had
a mission for us.
- Mission assignments are
the Batman's responsibility.
- But it's been over a week,
and nothing--
- You'll be tested soon enough.
For the time being, simply enjoy
each other's company.
- This team is not
a social club.
- No, but I am told
social interaction
Is an important
team-building exercise.
Perhaps you can keep busy by
familiarizing yourself with the cave.
- "Keep busy."
- Does he think
we're falling for this?
- Oh, I'll find out.
- Recognized: Red Tornado, 1-6.
-  I'm sorry.
I forgot he's a machine,
inorganic.
I cannot read his mind.
- Nice try, though.
So, uh, you know what
I'm thinkin' right now?
- We all know
what you're thinkin' now.
- Ow.
- And now we tour the clubhouse.
- Well, Superboy and I
live here.
We can play tour guides.
- Don't look at me.
- We won't. A private tour
sounds much more fun.
- Sh-she never said private.
- Team building. We'll all go.
- Unh!
- So this would be
our front door...
And this would be the back.
The cave is actually
the entire mountain.
- It was hollowed out
and reinforced
By Superman and Green Lantern
in the early days of the League.
- Then why abandon it
for the hall of justice?
- The cave's secret location
was compromised.
- So they traded it in
for a tourist trap?
Yeah. That makes sense.
- If villains know of the cave,
We must be on constant alert.
- The bad guys know we know
they know about the place,
So they'd never think
to look here.
- Uh, he means
we're hiding in plain sight.
- Ah, that's much clearer.
-
I smell smoke.
-  My cookies!
I was trying out grammy Jones
recipe from episode 17 of--
Heh. Never mind.
- I bet they'd have
tasted great.
He doesn't seem to mind.
-
I have a serious metabolism.
- I'll make more?
- It was sweet of you
to make any.
- Thanks, Aqualad.
- We're off duty.
Call me Kaldur'ahm.
Actually, my friends
call me Kaldur.
- I'm Wally. See? I already
trust you with my secret I.D.,
Unlike Mr. Dark Glasses
over here.
Batman's forbidden Boy Wonder
from telling anyone his real name.
- Mine's no secret.
It's M'gann M'orzz.
Like, you can call me Megan.
It's an Earth name,
and I'm on Earth now.
Don't worry, Superboy.
-
- We'll find you
an Earth name, too.
- Get out of my head!
- What's wrong?
I don't understand.
Everyone on Mars
communicates telepathically.
- M'gann, stop.
Things are different on Earth.
Here, your powers are
an extreme invasion of privacy.
- Besides, cadmus' creepy
little psychic genomes
Left a bad taste in his brain.
- I--I didn't mean to--
- Just stay out.
- Hello, Megan.
I know what we can do.
Superboy, please.
- Don't talk to me.
- It's my martian bioship.
- Cute.
Not aerodynamic, but cute.
- It's at rest, silly.
I'll wake it.
Well, are you coming?
Strap in for launch.
- Whoa.
- Cool.
- Red Tornado,
please open the bay doors.
- Incredible.
-  She sure is.
I--I mean the ship,
Which, like all ships, is a she.
- Fast with his feet,
not so much with his mouth.
- Dude!
- I may not have psychic powers,
But I can guess
what you're thinking.
You overreacted, and you
don't know how to apologize.
Just say sorry.
- He'll come around.
- He doesn't seem
to like me much.
- You guys remember he
has super hearing, right?
- Hey, how 'bout showing us
a little martian shape-shifting?
- Is it wrong
that I think I'm hot?
- Impressive,
But you know you're not exactly
gonna fool anyone with those.
- Mimicking boys
is a lot harder.
- And your clothes?
- They're organic,
like the ship.
They respond
to my mental commands.
- As long as they're
the only ones.
- Can you do that ghosting through
walls thing that manhunter does?
- Density shifting?
No. I-it's a very
advanced technique.
- Flash can vibrate his
molecules right through a wall.
Heh heh heh. When he tries it,
bloody nose.
- Dude!
- Here's something I can do.
Camouflage mode.
- Red Tornado to Miss Martian.
An emergency alert
has been triggered
At the Happy Harbor power plant.
I suggest
you investigate covertly.
I'm sending coordinates.
- Received. Adjusting course.
-  Tornado's
keeping us busy again.
- Well, a simple fire
led you to Superboy.
We should find out
what caused the alert.
- I think I know the cause.
- Robin, are tornadoes
common to New England?
Robin?
- He was just here.
- Unh!
- Who's your new friend?
- Didn't catch his name,
but he plays kinda rough.
- My apologies.
You may address me
as Mr. Twister.
- Uhh! Whoa!
- Whaah!
Uhh! Unh!
- I was prepared to be
challenged by a superhero.
I was not, however,
expecting children.
- We're not children!
- Objectively, you are.
Have you no adult supervision?
I find your presence here
quite disturbing.
- Well, we hate
to see you disturbed.
Let's see if you're more turbed
once we kick your can.
- Yaah!
- Indeed.
That was quite turbing.
Thank you.
- What have you done to my team?
- Embarrassed them, largely.
- Ahh!
- I got you, Wally.
- Ohh. Thanks.
- I would have thought you had all
learned your limitations by now.
- What do you want?!
- Isn't it obvious?
I'm waiting for a real hero.
- Read his mind.
Find a weakness.
- I thought I wasn't
supposed to do that.
- It's ok with the bad guys.
- Nothing. I'm getting nothing.
Hello, Megan.
Mr. Twister is Red Tornado
in disguise.
He's inorganic, an android.
And how many androids do you
know that can generate tornados?
- Red Tornado sent us here.
- After saying we'd be tested
soon enough.
This is his test,
something to keep us busy.
- Speedy called it.
We're a joke.
- Unh!
- This game, so over.
- We know who you are
and what you want.
- So let's end this.
- Consider it ended.
- An impressive show,
But we will not indulge you.
We will not engage.
- Uh, can Red Tornado do that?
- You think I'm Tornado? Ironic.
- Aah!
-
- Fine, then.
I won't deny
you children have power,
But playing hide-and-seek
with you
Would not help me
achieve my objectives,
So stay concealed.
If you confront me again,
I will show no mercy.
- What happened?
- I placed the bioship
between us.
- Unh! Unh!
And that's supposed
to make it right?
You tricked us into thinking
Twister was Red Tornado.
- She didn't do it on purpose.
- I-it was a rookie mistake.
We shouldn't have listened.
- You are pretty inexperienced.
Hit the showers.
We'll take it from here.
- Stay out of our way.
- I was just trying
to be part of the team.
- To be honest, I'm not sure
we really have a team.
- Certainly this will get
the required attention.
- You got ours,
Full and undivided!
- Immaterial and insufficient!
You are a distraction
I can no longer tolerate.
- Hraah!
- The team really
needs your help.
- If I intervened,
it would not be to help.
Still, it is an odd coincidence
That this Twister
shares my elemental abilities
And my immunity to telepathy.
- Hello, Megan.
- Ahh!
- Aah!
- Whoa. Whoa.
Ahh!
Whaah!
-
- You brought your utility belt?
- Never leave home without it--
first thing Batman taught me.
- Yeah, right after never
go to the bathroom without it.
-  Listen to me...
- Unh!
- All of you.
- What did we tell you?
- I know,
and I know I messed up,
But now I'm very clear
on what we need to do.
Please trust me.
- Get back!
Everyone clear the area!
-
- Hit the showers, boys.
I was hoping
you could handle this.
Clearly you cannot.
- But we've got a plan now.
- The subject
is not up for debate.
- I was beginning to believe
you'd never show up.
- I'm here now.
We are evenly matched, Twister.
- No, Tornado, we are not.
Remain still, android.
The reprogramming
won't take long.
- Longer than you might think.
- No.
Foul. I--I call foul.
- M'gann, no!
- Don't know how things
are done on Mars,
But on Earth, we don't
execute our captives!
- You said you trust me.
That's why
I couldn't read his mind.
- Cool. Souvenir.
- We should have had
more faith in you.
- Yeah. You rocked this mission.
Get it?
Rocked. Heh.
- Ignore him.
We're all just turbed
you're on the team.
- Heh. Thanks. Me, too.
- Heh. Now, brom,
aren't you relieved
I didn't let you
wear the armor?
- Extremely, professor,
but you're not upset?
- I'm convinced our tracking
program was operational
And that the real Tornado
was somewhere in the vicinity.
Besides, you know science
advances in fits and starts.
Even failure can be instructive,
And I'd say we learned
quite a lot today.
- It was clearly created
to sabotage or destroy you.
- Agreed.
- Is that why
you wouldn't help us?
- No. This was your battle.
I do not believe it is my role
to solve your problems for you.
Nor should you solve mine
for me.
- But if you're in danger...
- Consider this matter closed.
- Batman, Aquaman, and Flash,
They'd have jumped right in
to fix things.
- Guess if we're gonna have
a baby sitter,
A heartless machine
is exactly what we need.
- Dude! Harsh.
- And inaccurate.
I have a heart,
Carbon-steel alloy.
I also have excellent hearing.
- Heh. Right.
Sorry. I'll strive
to be more accurate.
- And more respectful.
- Speedy was so wrong.
This team thing...
- Might just work out.
- Sorry.
