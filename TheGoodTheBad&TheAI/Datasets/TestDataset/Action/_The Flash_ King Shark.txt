To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,
but in doing so, I opened
up our world to new threats,
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.
Zoom wants you dead.
Do you think he can do
everything really fast?
- How you doing, Dick?
- You're fast.
Welcome to my Earth-2.
Dad!
No! No!
Caitlin. That is your name, isn't it?
I hate the name Caitlin. I'm Killer Frost.
Ronnie and Caitlin's
doppelgangers are evil?
If you're coming with us. We have to go.
Cisco!
Get ready to close the breach for good,
Zoom's coming.
-
- No!
He's not dead. He's not dead.
Caitlin...
He's not dead. He's not.
- Caitlin...
- This isn't happening.
This isn't happening again.
Hey, I got you.
Come on.
- Open it up.
- Allen...
- I need to go back.
- I can't do that.
- Open it up!
- Allen!
The breaches are closed.
All the breaches are closed.
Why can't we just open one of 'em?
The quark matter energy that
we used to seal the breaches,
it prevents them from
being opened, ever again.
There's no going back to our world.
Wait.
We're trapped here for good?
Yes.
No, we can't just let
Zoom get away with this.
He just murdered Jay right in front of us.
There's got to be something we can do.
There's not.
Not this time.
It's over.
No.

How's she doing?
Not good. We tried to get her to go home,
but she refused to leave, so, you know,
I just sat with her until she fell asleep.
First Ronnie, now Jay.
Yeah.
I'm afraid what this double
dose of grief is gonna do to her.
I mean, she's pretty shell-shocked.
She'll be fine.
Snow's strong. She'll get past this.
But in the meantime, I
would not say anything to her
about her counterpart from my Earth.
That goes for Joe and Iris too.
Why?
Because you don't want
to influence their reality
in ways that should not be influenced.
Like in the same way as
when Barry time-travels?
Exactly, but also,
what's the point?
Those people are not your people.
Their lives are not your lives.
Never were, never will be.
Bury it. Move on.
Yes?
Yeah. That I can do.
Allen?
We kept what happened there
between the three of us
there was nothing we
could do now to stop Zoom.
to our new circumstances
and cope with our losses.
left scars on all of us,
some more than others.
off thoughts of the
surreal other life
other meta-human threat
to rear its ugly head
and distract me from the
frustration I was feeling,
All good.
Hey, ugly! It's time for dinner.
I think Bruce has gone belly up.
Power down the grid.
We're gonna have to fish him out.
So this is where Waller kept
all her secret projects, huh?
One of many sites, I'm learning.
I'm sure the new Director
of A.R.G.U.S. will clean up
the mess that Waller left behind.
Easier said than done, honey.
Hey.
My wife can do anything
she puts her mind to.
I repeat, code seven
in Aquaria Three.
There's been breach in the aquarium!
You have an aquarium? Why?
What the hell?
Are you kidding me?
Seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one.
- Whoa! Yes!
- Time.
Ain't nobody faster than me.
Whoo.
- I don't know about that.
-
Earth to Barry.
It's your turn, dude.
Yeah, it's time to show this little punk
who the fastest stack attacker alive is.
One of you guys go ahead. I'm gonna pass.
You're afraid of a little competition?
No, just not in a gaming mood right now.
Okay, well, I guess that makes me champ.
Right?
Anyway, I'm gonna go
meet up with some friends.
All right.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Maybe next time.
And I thought you were the competitive one
in the family.
I know, right? What's up, Bar?
Nothing. Just...
I don't know, I don't think
Wally likes me too much.
Well, we can fix that.
I mean, you been so busy running
between alternate realities,
you two haven't had a chance
to spend any time together.
What you want us to do together?
Get to know each other,
find something that
you guys have in common.
He's part of the family now, Bar,
You're gonna have to give it a chance.
I know.
All right, well, look, I'm
gonna head to bed, all right?
Mm.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Something is up with him,
and I don't think it's just Jay's death.
He's been acting weird
ever since he came back
from Earth-2.
Did he say anything to you
about what happened over there?
No, not a thing. You?
Hmm.
Hey, so... I been thinking.
You've been working around the clock.
Maybe you want to get some rest, go home.
You know, a good night's sleep wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world.
I'm fine.
Look, I get it.
You're having a hard
time with what happened.
It's a lot to take so soon after...
I said I'm fine.
Hey. Did you hear that?
No, what?
Caitlin just bit my head off.
She's been all business,
no emotion lately.
She's been... cold.
Cold? Come on, Cisco.
This could be the beginning
of her becoming evil.
You're not worried about that?
I'm not worried about that.
Caitlin's not gonna become Killer Frost.
Hm. You haven't mentioned anything
about about Earth-2, have you?
No, 'cause I know how to keep a secret.
All right, well, look, I
mean, it's gonna take some time
for her to heal.
We just got to be there
for her, keep her busy.
That shouldn't be a problem.
Oh. Hey, Dig, Lyla.
What are you guys doing here?
We came to give you the head's up, Barry.
About what?
A meta-human who escaped
from A.R.G.U.S. custody,
goes by the name King Shark.
King Shark?
You mean the half-man/half-shark
that tried to kill you
months ago. I thought he was dead.
That's what A.R.G.U.S.
wanted you to believe
when they snatched him up, but believe me,
this half-shark is very much alive,
and his biological imperative
is telling him to do one thing.
That's kill you, Barry.
We're gonna need a bigger Flash.
So how do you know about King Shark?
Well, as the new Director of A.R.G.U.S.,
Lyla's job is to clean
up Amanda Waller's messes.
King Shark was one of the
bigger and weirder ones.
And it appears under her directives,
A.R.G.U.S. had been
monitoring meta-human activity
for the past two years.
Why?
Well, to see if any of those
powers could be exploited.
Weaponized.
How do you know that he's coming after me?
While in our custody, he
kept saying the same thing.
"Zoom wants The Flash dead"
And although he removed
the tracker we had in him,
the readings we did
receive show he that was
headed towards Central City.
Let him come.
Barry, this thing is a killing machine.
We just came here to warn you, man.
Let A.R.G.U.S. handle it.
Nah, I can't do that, Dig.
I'm sorry, but all year,
we've been sitting ducks
for Zoom and his Earth-2 henchmen.
This is the last one.
I'm not gonna just wait for him to attack.
I'm going after him
first. I owe that to Jay.
Wells, he's from your Earth.
What do you know about him?
Real name, Shay Lamden, he was a...
get this... marine biologist
before my particle accelerator
changed him into King Shark, and
Zoom put him under his control.
So how did you track him
when he attacked Barry?
Zoom sent him to this Earth to kill Barry.
I just followed.
Yeah, but you did track Grodd down.
Can you find King Shark too?
I can try.
All right.
Okay, well, all these locations
are next to a body of water.
There must only be a few
hours before he needs to get
back into the water to
re-oxygenate his blood.
I can take the waterfront.
Can you have your team handle the rest?
- I'll get them on it.
- All right.
What about Dr. Lamden's doppelganger?
Maybe he could help us somehow.
Or not. Looks like he died
when the particle accelerator exploded.
What about next of kin?
He's got a widow, Doctor Tanya Lamden.
She's a research
scientist at Nautilus Labs,
and she studies... wait for it... sharks.
Maybe the two of you can go
and see if she's discovered
anything in her research
that could help us.
Sure.
Great.
- Hey, Digg.
- Yeah?
How's that helmet treating you?
Could use some improvements.
I'll get to work on it.
Hey, Joe, what's up?
Hey, Bar, I talked to Wally,
he wants to meet up with you.
All right.
He's working on his engineering project
at our place tonight.
He would love some help
from that big brain of yours.
Okay, Joe, look, I'm sorry,
right now is kind of a crazy time.
What? What's going on?
Remember that meta-human shark
that Patty was after and attacked me?
He's back? I thought Wells... you know.
Yeah, me too, but
apparently, A.R.G.U.S. had him
and he escaped, and now he's
heading for Central City.
I get it.
I'll tell Wally some other time.
Hey, you know what?
It's all good, I'll make it work.
Tell him tonight should be fine.
Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Bar.
Yeah, bye.
Why?
It's been two years since your
particle accelerator exploded.
Seems a little late to be asking questions
about my husband, doesn't it?
Your husband passed away
from cancer, correct?
I suppose you could say that.
It only took three days
for every cell in his body
to grow uncontrollably.
Whatever cancer he had, it
turned him into something...
not human.
Well, that's why we're here, actually.
There's a meta-human in Central City
whose body seems to be mutating
in the same way as your late husband,
but he didn't die, he
became a dangerous monster.
My husband was no monster.
That's not what she was implying.
What does this have to do with me?
We've read about the research
you're doing here on sharks.
Mm-hmm, yeah, I've had
some encouraging results,
although still preliminary.
We need to see it.
I beg your pardon?
Your research, all of it.
What my colleague means to say is that
if you could please let us
take a look at your findings,
it could help us stop this
meta-human from hurting anyone.
You're with S.T.A.R. Labs.
I'm just supposed to trust you?
Please, Mrs. Lamden.
This could help save lives.
I'll email you what I have.
Thank you.
- Little harsh.
- I was being direct.
Yeah, well, that's one way to describe it.
You've been acting differently toward me
ever since you got back from Earth-2.
What's your problem, Cisco?
Nothing.
Let's just go.
Grid one, negative.
Grid four, negative.
Status check, grid two.
Anything?
No, man, nothing yet.
Yeah, so far, nothing on our end either.
Let's just hope Wells is
doing better than we are.
Hey, how's Felicity doing?
Well, I'm not gonna lie,
Barry, it was pretty rough
there at first, but you
know Felicity, she's tough.
Yeah, she's just not
returning any of my calls.
She has a lot going on right now.
Buddy, I'll ask if she can give you a call
when this is all over.
Just want to catch this thing, man,
have everything to do with
Zoom and Earth-2 put behind us,
so we can just move on with our lives.
Starting to do that
thing Oliver does, Barry,
carry the weight of the
world on your shoulders.
Got to stop that, man,
it's gonna slow you down.
Still nothing.
Status check, Grid six.
So much for cleaning up
after Waller's messes.
We don't find King Shark soon,
someone's gonna be cleaning up after mine.
We'll find him, Lyla.
All right, I searched the whole area.
He's gone.
Couldn't have gotten far.
Still, he knows we're here now.
We lost the element of surprise.
Not if Wells can figure
out a way to track him.
In the meantime, we'll keep looking.
All right, I'll meet
up with you guys later.
I got to go see Joe's son.
Okay, I thought our
relationship was hard to follow.
See ya.
He's fast, John, get over it.
Never.
Joe thought I should have you take a look.
So, this is what I got so
far for my project essay
to get into CCU's engineering program.
Turbine supercars?
Turbines? Like jet engines?
Yeah, yeah, it'd use an
engine like the ones they have
in some helicopters, only
it'd run on bio-diesel.
- Cool.
- It's very cool.
Yeah, you're gonna want to address
the fuel economy issue here.
It is a jet, so it's gonna
burn through a lot of fuel.
Yeah, that's why I want to use bio-diesel.
It'll run off of anything
that burns with oxygen.
No, okay, but you also got a sound issue.
Gonna wake the neighbors...
For sure.
Anything else?
Um...
Well, I just... want to help, you know.
I'm just trying to make
sure they don't have
any reason to say no.
Okay.
Sorry, Wally, I didn't mean that...
it looks really good.
All right, let's start over, okay?
Is it...
why don't we go through it
all together, work it out?
Sounds good.
Cool.
This is a complete waste of time.
We're not gonna find anything
in Doctor Lamden's research
to tell us how to find King Shark.
Maybe I should take a look.
Oh, yeah, 'cause you're the doctor
with a specialty in bio-chem.
I'm just saying maybe you could use
another set of eyes, considering.
Considering what?
Considering the way
you've been acting lately.
What does that mean?
You are not yourself, Caitlin,
and it's freaking me out, 'cause you have
this icy look in your eye
just like you did over there.
Over there?
You mean Earth-2?
No. Uh, no.
Um, what I meant to say was...
You met my doppelganger, didn't you?
What? No.
Cisco.
Look, I'm not supposed to say anything.
Why not?
Because I'm not supposed to say anything.
Francisco Ramon, if you
don't start talking...
Okay, fine, yes, I met your doppelganger.
She's a coldhearted ice
queen named Killer Frost,
a meta-human who enjoyed killing a lot.
There, great.
Now Harry's gonna kill me and
throw myself across the room.
Cisco, I'm not a meta-human.
Okay, I hear you, but you're acting
just like she did over there.
You're being shut off.
You're being detached.
You're being cold.
Because I have to be right now.
I just watched Jay get killed
right in front of my eyes,
just when I was starting
to feel normal again,
just when I was beginning to love.
So if I let myself feel,
if I let all of that pain and anger out,
it's never gonna stop,
and that's not gonna help me either,
so let's just get back to this research
and figure out how to find King Shark.
Okay.
Here you are.
Yup, just like back home, always working.
I'm trying to locate this King Shark.
He's here? On this Earth?
Yes, it turns out our friend Zoom
brought him here to kill The Flash.
Looks like he's stuck
here just like we are.
It looks like he is, and
so I need to figure this out
before more people get hurt, Jessie, so...
Probability distribution algorithm?
Partial matching strategies, yes.
Based on what?
Semantic trajectories...
water, Central City, The Flash.
What about mobility behaviors?
Jessie.
Look, you wanted me out of that room,
but now that I am, you don't want me here.
Just let me help, please.
Grab a marker.
Yeah.
Hardest part was amping the torque
without increasing drag.
A heavier engine would
only slow things down,
but this streamlined
version should optimize
both the torque and the horsepower.
Yeah, I'm just worried
it's... won't be enough still.
Here, let's do this...
use a one-to-one transfer gearbox
to drop the output shaft of the engine,
reverse rotation and send more power
to the torque converter.
I didn't come for you
to just do it for me.
I thought we were gonna
work on this together.
Yeah, we are, I'm...
I'm just trying to speed up the process.
Why?
What, you got somewhere better to be?
No, Wally, I'm... Wally.
All right.
Do you have a problem with me?
Who could have a problem with you?
You're Barry, right? You're perfect.
Never do anything wrong.
Always this, always that.
Wally.
I mean, take a look around you, man.
You're in every picture in this room.
You know, thanks for your help,
but I'll just take care of this myself.
Where's The Flash?
I know The Flash is here.
I can smell him.
Everybody get out!
Come on. All right, come on.
Where is he?
Right here!
Flash, Zoom wants you dead!
Yeah, I know.
Then you get to go home, right?
Well, guess what, man.
The breaches that Zoom
used to bring you here,
they're all gone. I closed 'em, for good!
There's no more Zoom.
There's no way back to your Earth.
You're gonna be locked up
here for a very long time.
No!
You might be fast, but not
as fast as I am in water!
You're not gonna catch me, Flash!
Okay.
You okay?
Oh, yeah, I'm good.
Think he broke a few things, but I'm good.
I don't suppose my homeowner's insurance
covers a "Sharknado" attack.
I don't understand you people.
Jaws busts through your
house like the Kool-Aid Man,
The Flash shows up, and y'all
just act like it's no big deal.
Yeah, well, we've had a
lot of weird things happen
in Central City over the past two years.
Weirder than a talking
shark wearing pants?
Man, you'd be surprised.
Hey.
Hey, you guys. Everybody okay?
Yeah, yeah, we're fine.
What'd you go hide under your bed?
Wally, come on.
You know, Joe and Iris
told me a lot about you,
made it out like you could
walk on water, or something,
but they never mentioned anything
about you being a coward.
Okay, enough!
See you guys later.
Dad, you need to talk to him.
No. It's fine, I get it.
Look, I know you guys love me,
but please stop telling Wally
all this great stuff about me.
Start telling him the
truth. I'm not perfect.
I make mistakes that
even The Flash can't fix.
Okay.
What happened with you on Earth-2?
The truth.
I shouldn't... tell you guys this, but...
I met your doppelgangers.
You were the cop in the
family, a good one too.
I told you I would've made a good cop.
Don't get any ideas.
What about me then?
You were a lounge singer.
Yeah, you had this
amazing voice, actually,
but you didn't like me at all.
You actually blamed me
for Iris becoming a cop,
said that she only became one
to help her selfish husband's career.
Wait.
We were married?
Mm-hmm.
And we went to go see Joe perform.
And that's when everything went wrong.
Um, some metas that
worked for Zoom showed up,
they were looking for me.
They knew I wasn't supposed to be there,
and they attacked,
and you got caught in the crossfire,
and... you died.
I knew that it wasn't you,
that none of that was this life,
but...
I mean, watching it happen
in front of me, living that,
it didn't feel any different,
because it was all still real.
And Jay warned me not to
get emotionally sucked in
when I went there,
and then that's exactly what happened.
And now Joe West on Earth-2
is dead, because I showed up.
Barry, that... that's not your fault.
Yeah, it is my fault.
It's all my fault.
Zoom,
this King Shark,
Jay's death,
it's all because of me.
And then I just left an entire world
at Zoom's mercy.
Just when you thought it was
safe to go back in the suburbs,
King Shark shows up at your house.
I mean, I don't even know how he found me.
It's not like I was The
Flash while I was at home.
- Must be a reason.
- Yeah.
Have you figured out a way
to track King Shark yet?
No, I don't have enough information
to create an accurate location algorithm.
What about Dr. Lamden's research?
Anything that can help us?
I didn't think so at first,
but then I found something
that I think might help us.
Sharks are predators.
In order to track their prey, they use
what's known as passive electrolocation.
Passive electrolocation?
Yes, it's how they sense
the bioelectric potential
around a fish's body.
King Shark senses
electricity in Barry's system.
Okay, that explains how
King Shark can track Barry,
but how is that going
to help us track him?
We flip it. Instead of King Shark
being the predator, we make him the prey,
and track him using
active electrolocation.
We reprogram our satellite to generate
a specific electric field and then measure
any electrical distortions that correlate
with a 1-ton walking shark.
That'll help us get him.
You help me out?
Sure.
Great.
Let us know when you locate him
and we'll take it from there.
Okay.
Let's get the team ready.
What exactly is that?
That, my friend, is bait.
You made a Flash lure?
It's the best I could come up with
given the time frame.
It's rigged to mimic and enhance
the electric field Barry's body generates.
King Shark takes one whiff of that,
Also stuffed it with enough tranqs
to knock him out for a month.
Should make him a lot easier to reel in.
And that container.
Strong enough to hold
him once he's sedated?
It's made of promethium
metal. It's impenetrable.
Meanwhile, we'll be able
to keep track of King Shark
with this, and the cameras
that are on the lure.
Whatever he does, we'll have eyes on him.
All right, then. Let's go fishing.
Caitlin, I don't understand why
I can't be the one playing
Quint in this scenario.
I should be the one out there, not you.
I need to do this.
You know Quint dies, right?
Water is this monster's natural habitat.
He's gonna be a lot stronger here.
You sure about this?
This ends tonight.
Maybe he's not gonna fall for this
He's a shark. He'll come.
Anything, Cisco?
Uh, nope, nothing that
looks like it could be him.
You programmed the
satellite though, right?
Yes, Harry.
I mean, you punched in
the correct parameters?
You're insulting my intelligence.
But they've been waiting for hours.
Did you punch in the correct parameters?
I know they've been out there for hours,
but you're insulting my
intelligence with this, okay?
- I know.
- Okay.
Hey, you set the right
distortion scope, right?
Oh, for real? Okay.
You know what, we're
gonna play a game here.
It's called, if you're from Earth-2,
you're gonna be quiet, okay?
Yeah.
Hey, Barry, are you okay?
Ever since Zoom beat
me here and on Earth-2,
I've been running away from things,
instead of towards them.
That needs to change.
We'll get you back there.
I know.
Think of this as your first step.
Or swim.
Uh, hey, guys. What is that?
The big kahuna. Guys, incoming.
Whoa.
He ate the lure!
Reel him in, all right?
Come on.
Where'd he go?
He's headed for the docks.
Go, go, go.
Get ready to fire!
Those guns won't stop me, Flash.
First I'll kill you, then I'll kill them.
Oh, yeah? Let's do this then!
Come on!
What is he doing?
He's electrifying the water.
Ohh.
Now we can reel him in.
Hell of a catch, Barry.
Yeah.
Let's just make sure he doesn't
become "the one that got away."
Won't let that happen again.
What are you gonna do with him?
I don't know yet. But
one thing's for sure,
A.R.G.U.S.'s plans to turn
King Shark into a weapon
died with Amanda Waller.
I think our time would be better served
learning about how he came
to be and how to cure him.
You know, you should
really talk to Dr. Lamden.
She's done a lot of research,
and I think it could be helpful to you.
I'll do that. Nice to see you again.
Mm-hmm.
Well, thanks a lot, Dig.
Hey, I got to thank you, Barry.
Got Lyla get her first win, I
got to watch you run on water.
It was biblical.
Look, Barry, when I was in Afghanistan,
I lost a lot of friends... brothers.
So losing Jay, I know what it feels like.
Question yourself. Blame
yourself for his death.
And that guilt, it can tear
you apart, but trust me, man,
you got to get control of it,
or it'll rip you up inside.
Use this, man, let it guide you,
so it never happens again.
- All right, thanks, man.
- You got it.
Say hi to everyone for me, all right?
- I will.
-
Yeah, okay. That's kind of freaky.
Yeah, yeah, see? I told you.
Hey, Oliver, what's up?
You're a really slow reader.
So?
I want one of these super cars.
I mean, especially if I can run it
off the bacon grease I collect? I mean...
Man, Wally. I'm so impressed.
Thanks.
But Barry gave me a lot of help, so...
Yeah, he did, but this was all your idea,
this is your hard work. It's all you.
Barry'd say the same thing.
Would he?
Look, Wally.
Iris and I took Barry in when he was 11,
and the reason he came to live with us
is because his mother was murdered,
and his father was
wrongfully imprisoned for it.
And I have been overprotective
of that kid since that day.
We gave him all the love
and support he needed
to get through that tragedy
and become the man he is now.
So that... that pride
you see when Iris and
I are talking about him,
is because...
things could have gone very differently.
But he's not perfect,
and he's not favored over
you or Iris or anybody else.
So you have nothing to worry about.
He's my son...
just like you are.
What are you doing with those?
I'm adjusting the wavelength trigger,
see if I can get these to work over here.
So you can catch some breachers?
Dear God!
Caitlin, your hands are freezing.
Caitlin. I've always hated that name.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, it's starting.
You're starting to become...
Killer Frost?
That ain't right.
That ain't right, that's just rude.
Who put you up to this?
Barry put you up to this, didn't he?
Oh, I should've know you two were...
- Cold?
- Yeah.
You deserve it for thinking
that I could ever become like her.
Cisco, you need to stop worrying about me.
I may be sad, I may want to
be alone for a little while,
but I promise you, Killer
Frost will never exist
on this earth, okay?
Besides, you tested me.
I don't even have the meta-human gene,
so please stop worrying about me, okay?
Okay.
Come on, Barry wants us upstairs.
For real, though, you got
to work on that circulation.
You might have Raynaud's or something.
- You know what Raynaud's is?
- I'm a doctor, Cisco.
Hail, hail, the gang's
all here. What's good?
Uh...
I need to apologize to you all.
Um...
Last year I made a choice
to go back in time and save my mother,
and that choice had a lot of consequences
that will haunt me for
the rest of my life,
just like I know it haunts all of you too.
Zoom, Jay's death...
It's all because of me,
but I own those choices.
We're the ones who opened
the door to Earth-2.
We're the ones who brought Zoom here,
but we are also the ones
who are gonna stop him.
How?
How are we gonna stop Zoom, Allen?
I don't know yet.
But those breaches aren't closed forever,
and we're not done with Earth-2.
Jay's death was not in vain.
We will meet Zoom again,
and the next time, I will beat him,
whoever that monster is.
Well, this is a complication.
