to build a 30-foot statue
of himself.
Well, it's obviously aimed at first-time visitors
to create feelings of smallness...
inadequacy.
Good thing
it ain't workin'.
Reed, what are we doing here?
This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science.
This wasn't our first stop,
in case you forgot.
Besides, Victor's not that bad.
He's just a little... larger than life.
- Hi, Reed Richards and Ben Grimm-
- Executive elevator. Top floor.
What's it take to get
a smile around this joint?
that exposure to
a high-energy cosmic storm...
borne
on solar winds...
might have triggered the evolution
of early planetary life.
In six weeks
another cloud...
In six weeks another cloud...
with the same elemental profile...
will pass Earth's orbit.
A study, conducted in space...
could fundamentally advance
our knowledge...
about the structure
of the human genome...
- I don't think I've explained my proposal fully.
- No, I think you have.
Same old Reed- always stretching,
reaching for the stars...
with the weight of the world
on his back.
But dreams don't pay the bills,
do they?
You remember,
when we were in school...
we talked about working together.
Well, that's what
I was about to explain.
So, it's not just my money you want.
It's my toys.
That's my job-
to stay a step ahead...
to know what other men don't.
- I can't take this.
- Ben, this is business. Just work.
He's right, Ben-
It is just business.
One more thing he's got.
- Hey.
Oh, it's so nice to see you.
How's Debbie?
- Great.
- Great.
- Uh, how have you been?
- Never better.
- This isn't gonna be a problem, is it?
- Oh, not at all.
- No, l-
Then you are just in time...
to hear the great Reed Richards...
ask  for help.
You made a lot of folks at M.I.T.
Feel like a junior high science fair...
so you'll excuse me
if I savor the moment.
You back this mission...
and I'll sign over a fair percentage
of any applications-
The number is 75,
and its applications and patents.
- What about his firstborn?
- Ben.
Come on.
Twenty-five percent of a billion is enough
to keep the lights on a while, isn't it?
Maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage
on the Baxter Building.
Deal?
Well, then, to our future.
Together.
It's funny how things turn out,
isn't it?
Hilarious.
He knew about NASA.
Maybe he made the call to shut us down.
Ben, think about all the people
we can help if this works. Huh?
Look, we got what we wanted.
That's enough.
A few days in space. It'll be great.
What's the worst that can happen?
If Reed's right, this little trip
could double our stock offerings.
And if he's not?
Reed's always right.
Good thing he doesn't always know
what he's got.
Reed, you should know those solar winds
have been picking up speed.
- I factored them into my coordinates.
- Right.
Of course you did.
In theory.
- It's a little different once you're out there.
- I can assure you-
When are we leaving?
I'll be scheduling the launch.
You can call me in the morning
for resources and crew.
- I think I remember the number.
- It's been changed.
I was hoping Ben
could pilot the mission.
We already have a pilot
on our payroll.
But you're welcome to ride shotgun.
Remember my brotherJohnny?
##
##
- ##
- Can't do it. Cannot do it.
External S.R.B.'s,
orbital system engines.
- It's just like the shuttle you flew-
- No!
- I cannot take orders from the underwear model.
- Oh, come on, now.
That wingnut washed out of NASA for
sneaking two Victoria's Secret wannabes...
into a flight simulator.
- Youthful high spirits.
- They crashed it into a wall.
A flight simulator.
When have I ever asked you to do something
you absolutely said you could not do?
Five times.
- I had it at four.
- Well, this makes five.
##
##
I miss you already, Debs.
Digital camera- $254.
Memory stick- $59.
The look on your hard-ass
former C.O.'s face...
when he finds out he's
your junior officer- priceless.
-
-  Thank you. That's so sweet.
I can handle this ship.
I can even handle
Mr. Blond Ambition.
But I don't know if I should be flying
or doing  in these suits.
Who the hell came up with these?
Victor did.
The synthetics act as a second skin,
adapting to your body's individual needs.
Wow. Fantastic.
Material made from self-regulating,
unstable molecules.
I've been working on
a formula for this.
Great minds think alike.
- Here you go, Ben.
- Thanks, sweetie.
If you're good, maybe next time
Daddy'll let you drive.
You keep talkin',
and there won't be a next time.
Long way
from the projection booth...
at the Hayden Planetarium,
isn't it?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
We can monitor the cloud's approach
and observe the tests from here.
Is it safe?
The shields on the station
should protect us.
- "Should"?
- What's the matter, Ben?
Getting paranoid in your old age?
Let's start loading those samples.
Get your suit ready, Ben.
So I see you're still doing
all the heavy lifting.
Maybe you should have stayed in the lab.
Fieldwork never suited you.
So, take a walk, Ben.
Actually, if you'll all excuse me,
I need to borrow Susan...
Sure.
Please tell me your guy's not trying
to rekindle things with my sister again.
Of course not.
It's strictly business.
Yes, well, his eyes
say differently, don't they?
Hey. Two hearts
got busted last time.
Maybe she's not over it either.
Wow, Dr. Phil, that's deep.
Let's think about that.
and you got Reed,
world's dumbest smart guy...
worth less than a postage stamp.
That's a real toss-up.
Don't trouble your tiny little mind.
Don't wander off now, boy.
-
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
I understand the business reasons.
Well, when you're
looking at your future...
it doesn't hurt
to find closure about the past.
Susan, every man dreams he'll meet
a woman he can give the world to.
In my case,
it's not just a metaphor.
That can't be right.
We've been together
two years now.
It's been a good two years, Victor.
The company's accomplished so much.
Right. Of course. The company.
But I've come to realize...
that all the accomplishments in the world
mean nothing without someone
to share them with.
- Um-
- I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.
- Now it's time to take the biggest step of all.
- Victor-
If it helps,
think of this as a... promotion.
Victor, l-
I have four words.
Four little words that can change
our lives forever.
We've got minutes until it hits,
not hours.
We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve
at the first glitch. Just close the shields.
- Ben is still out there.
- So reel him in.
Victor, Reed's right.
We have less than six minutes.
- Ben, get inside now!
- What's going on?
I ain't done arrangin'
your flowers yet, egghead.
-  Guys, I'm not gonna make it.
- You gotta jump!
- Closing the shields.
- You can't just leave them out there.
- Watch me.
You can't help them
any more than I can!
I can try.
Come on, Ben! You got this!
Johnny, get ready to close the portal.
-
-
- You okay?
- Oh. Yeah.
- You okay?
- Oh. Yeah.
Ben! Ben!
Ben!
Hey, rise and shine, big boy.
How you feeling?
- Back on Earth.
We're in quarantine.
Victor's medical facility.
Oh, they're fine.
Everybody else is fine.
I swear to you, Ben, they've done
everything humanly possible.
The best plastic surgeons in the world
are here, Ben. You had the best.
- I don't know if that's a good idea.
- They said the shock alone-
Okay, Ben.
Just be strong.
Hey. Nice do.
Likin' the grandpa look.
What?
By whom, my competitors?
- How's she doing?
- Stable.
And her vitals are strong.
Blood panels show no irradiation.
Good.
- You'll step up this protocol-
- Every four hours, yes.
We know what we're doing.
- Another day of observation, and you're all clear.
-
She's allergic to orchids.
Put the sunflowers by her bed.
the bank would like
to congratulate you...
- We can't even give your stock away.
- Ned, I can turn this around.
You're going to have to, Victor,
or we pull out.
- You have a week.
- You're enjoying this, aren't you, Ned?
One week.
I don't know if  noticed, but the sickest
runs this side of the Alps are right outside.
Yeah, I've noticed. But there are rules here.
You can't leave until we-
Until we've finished the tests. I know.
I've never been good with rules.
You let me know
how those come out.
- Do you wanna help me with the zipper?
- This is not a ski resort.
Not yet.
Luckily, Grandma still sends care packages.
It's amazing.
- For an 80-year-old woman, you'd be surpri-
- You are trouble.
- Oh, you're hot.
- Why, thank you. So are you.
- And I'm not afraid to cry.
- No, I mean you feel a little feverish.
I've never felt better in my life.
My God, you smell good.
- When do you get off work?
- 4:00, but l-
Tell you what. You meet me at 4:01
at the top of the mountain.
That'll give you
a minute to freshen up.
This is yours. That's mine.
Nurses!
Hey. Three days.
I was worried about you.
How are you feeling?
Solid.
Uh, it was a close one, though, huh?
What was that about?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
I've been going over the figures again and again,
and they all add up.
I just don't understand.
Maybe I should've aborted-
Reed, it was a freak of nature.
You couldn't have possibly predicted it.
- Let it go.
-
You know, you live through
something like this...
- Yeah, you and Debbie are perfect.
- I'm not talking about Debbie.
What? Come on.
She's got a good thing with Victor.
- He's smart, he's powerful, he's successful-
- Maybe you should date him then.
Ben, she ended up
with the right guy.
Things worked out for the best.
Do I have to do everything myself?
##
##
You should stay to the right.
The left might give you trouble.
- I think we should drop, like, 10 more feet.
- Good.
Last one down
springs for room service!
Whoo-hoo!
##
My future wife!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
You're losing!
All right, no more kid stuff.
Check this out!
##
- You're on fire!
- Thanks! You're pretty good too!
No! You're on  Look!
##
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Whoa-ohh!
Care to join me?
I can only stay for one drink.
I have to meet Victor.
Oh. Wouldn't want
to keep Vic waiting.
Reed, what are you doing here?
I thought-
- It's fallen.
We're looking at low 20s.
It's a good number, considering the fallout from-
From Reed's disaster?
Journal.
Gonna have to do something
about this scar.
Make sure they only shoot me
from my left side.
Actually, uh, the scar's tracking well.
People seem to think
it humanizes you.
And that's a good thing?
Maybe you should get some rest.
Later.
First I have some unfinished business.
A deal that needs closing.
Sir, I have always wondered-
Why Sue?
That's why. Because I could
have any other woman.
-
- No, let me tell the story! Let me tell the story!
-
- Oh-
-
- Wow.
-
- You all right?
Bad shrimp.
I think I'd better go lie down.
Excuse me.
Oh, God.
Yes. Thank you.
Good.
That's, uh, good.
You always had a way with words.
Uh-Wow.
I should be going, 'cause, uh...
I have to meet Victor.
I'm really happy for you and Victor.
You're really happy
for me and Victor?
I can tell you guys are enjoying
what was the best part of our relationship.
- Which was?
- Passion.
For science.
You are such a dork, Reed.
You never got it,
and you never will.
- What did I say?
- Unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
I just wanted
to let you know that I was-
It's been two years, and all you can say
is you're happy for me and some other guy?
It's nice to be wanted
sometimes, Reed...
to be seen and heard.
Look at me.
I can't.
- What do you mean, you can't? Look at me!
- Sue, look at your hands.
Hey! You guys-
Hey. You are never gonna believe
what just happened to me.
What?
Oh. Well, I can explain this.
It has to be the cloud.
It's fundamentally altered our D.N.A.
Let's not jump to conclusions.
We need a massive amount of evidence
before making that leap.
Now, picture that, but
It was
What?
The cloud has fundamentally
altered our D.N.A.
Cool!
- And you know what, guys? I think I was flying.
- We need to find Ben.
-
-
-
-
I said cut it out, Johnny.
- Still getting the hang of it.
- Hey, Ben! It's Reed!
- Stop.
- All right.
- All right?
- Yes!
- God! What's wrong with you?
- God! What?
- Sue, do you know the code?
-
Hey, Ben! Open up!
- You all right, Ben?
- Hey, does somebody have keys to these doors?
That's gross.
Look! Look, look, look, look!
What is that thing?
- Are you feeling all right?
- I'm fine. Just a few scrapes, that's all.
Symptoms?
- Victor, um, I should have-
- Just find him.
Anybody got any ideas
where the big guy's going?
-
- ##
-
- Oh, you gotta be kiddin' me.
-
-
Little buttons! Hello, Operator?
- Debs? It's me.
Ben? Are you all right?
You sound a little different.
- Uh, listen, I need you to come out front.
- Out front?
- You're home, baby?
-
- Yeah.
-
I got a surprise for you.
Yeah, I got a little one for you too.
Where are you?
I'm over here.
Don't come any closer for a sec, okay?
Honey, what's going on?
Debs...
remember w-when we used to say...
together forever,
no matter what?
Yeah?
Baby, you're scaring me.
- Oh, my God.
- Deb.
It's me. It's still me.
It was the accident.
- Let me explain.
- No! Don't touch me!
- Debs!
-
-
Oh, yeah, Ben.
A few days in space. It'll be great.
What's the worst that could happen?
Hey, little guy.
You're not afraid of me, are ya?
Perfect.
Thanks.
-
- Hey!
-
- You think you got problems?
You take a good look, pal.
Huh. How bad could it be, right?
- I don't think you-
-
Okay, pal, take it easy.
No, no, no. Don't go out there.
I said stop, you fruitcake!
No, no, no. Come closer.
That's further! Come closer!
I said stop! No, no, no!
Whoa!
Whoa!
-
- Come here!
-
- All right.
Calm down.
You wanna be scared?
Fine!
-
-
- Give me a couple tow trucks.
- Get back! Get back!
- What are we gonna do now?
- We're not gonna get past these guys.
But you could.
Sorry about the truck, pal.
Come on.
- Stuck.
-
Sue, your clothes. Lose them.
Oh. Right.
This is so wrong.
-
Oh!
- Wow. You've been working out.
- Shut up!
All right.
All right, freeze!
Now, just, uh-
just put the man
in the seat down!
Do it!
Any more great ideas? Why don't  strip
down and have 100 people stare at you?
Oh. Hmph!
I'm gonna need therapy.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
-
- I still can't believe you made me do that.
- We got through, didn't we?
Just find Ben.
-
Ben! Ben!
- Whoa!
-
- Stay here, okay?
-
-
-
-  No, you-
-
-
-
Don't.
- No!
-
- Hang on!
-
- Huh?
- I got ya.
-
-
- Ben!
Whoo-hoo!
I swear to you...
I will do everything in my power...
until there is not a breath left in me-
You're gonna be Ben again.
I told you I felt fine.
Where are your ears?
- There are some folks outside
that want to talk to you.
- We're not going public.
- We're scientists, not celebrities.
- It's too late, son.
Look.
- When a New York Fire Department ladder truck...
- See that?
Became part of the tragedy.
That's what they're calling you-
the Fantastic Four.
- Cool!
- No, wait! Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go talk to 'em.
- No!
- We should think this through.
- That's great. Brainstorm.
Get back here right now! Johnny!
- Settle down!
-
Do you believe this?
- Which one of you is the leader?
- That would be me.
No, seriously.
Okay, son, you're on.
Uh...
during our recent mission
to the Von Doom space station...
we were exposed to
as-yet unidentified radioactive energy.
- What happened on the bridge?
- How can you stretch?
- Is it true you can fly?
- Yeah, I'm working on it. It's actually difficult-
No, actually, we do not know
much more than you do at this point.
Uh, sir, Larry King just canceled.
Apparently there's a bigger story.
NASDAQ was up 9.9-
Bravest-
Actually, here they come now.
named the Fantastic Four-
We will be going directly to our lab
to diagnose our symptoms.
No! No, no, no.
It's not a disease.
Symptoms? If having special powers
is a disease, then, yeah, we got it bad.
Excuse me.
That thing doesn't look so fantastic.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero.
What he means is,
every team needs a mascot.
-
- A new day is dawning.
Look- Look, we went up to space
to find a way to understand D.N. A... .
Well, now it's our D.N.A.,
our "disease," our lives on the line.
Thank you.
No more questions.
This is how you turn things around?
These freaks on the front page...
your company's in the obituaries?
- I was planning to use the publicity-
- The bank's lost enough already.
- Wait a minute.
It's too late, Victor.
Do you know how much money
I've invested in this company?
Victor, stop.
This isn't a negotiation.
Is all that for you, Dr. Richards?
I'm afraid so.
Come on, Ben. Smile.
They wanna like you, bud. Say hi.
Uh, don't do drugs!
-
-
Welcome back to the Baxter,
Dr. Richards.
I've got the usual for you.
- Good to have you back, sir.
- Thanks, Willie.
We had a tough year.
Yeah, like, nine straight.
-
-
Either we're moving
really fast or not at all.
I'll take the stairs.
How come Ben can't turn it
on and off like we can?
That's what we're here to find out.
- If it happened to him-
- What? You mean, like, we won't
be able to turn it off either?
- That would save time. Ha!
- You wanna walk around on fire
the rest of your life?
- Is that a trick question?
- Grow up.
Come on. Am I the only guy
who thinks this is cool?
We should stay here until we can
define the extent of our changes...
and figure out how to reverse them.
Whoa.
So, what do you think?
I don't know, Reed.
I think you might be bringing
your work home with you.
Come on. Let me show
you guys where you'll be staying.
Busy guy.
- Hi, everybody.
- Mr. Von Doom!
Would you like to comment
on the recent failure of your I.P.O.?
- I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to call.
- Please.
I've arranged for your things
to be moved to one of my condos.
- You'll have round-the-clock care.
- Thank you.
That's very generous of you, but I think
I should stay here with my brother...
until we get a handle on things.
Susan, I think you should
let my doctors have a look at you.
What are you doing here?
I'm starting to wonder
the same thing.
- How much do you know
about what happened to you?
- Not much.
- We need to run tests
to see the extent of the damage.
- You let me know what I can do.
We're all in this together now.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
the mission didn't go as planned.
Didn't go as planned?
With all due respect, we're both to blame.
I told you to abort.
Abort?
I put my company, my name,
billions of dollars on the line.
- I will not let you make me look like a fool.
- If we could understand-
I don't want to understand it!
This isn't one of your science projects!
I just want to fix it, fast!
-
No.
-
- No problem, Ben.
Just pay your damn electric bill
and get to work on finding a cure.
Whoa!
Wow!
He's heating up from his core.
we need to isolate
your recombinant D.N. A... .
So we can activate
positional genomes.
- Huh?
- We have to do a physical
to see what got zapped.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
How bad is it?
You know, I used to smoke.
if you could control
your emotional state better.
- Excuse me?
- If you had more self-control,
you could locate the trigger.
Can you remember
your exact emotions on the bridge?
Anger.
Rage. Frustration.
Okay, is there any way to duplicate
that feeling? Some memory or-
I'm sure I can
come up with something.
- You feel anything?
- Nope.
Okay.
It's hotter than I anticipated.
- Johnny, back it down.
- I can go hotter!
Johnny, back it down right now!
Johnny!
-
- Ohh!
Johnny, you were at 4,000 Kelvin.
- Any hotter, and you're approaching supernova.
- Sweet!
No, not sweet.
That's the temperature of the sun.
Got it.
Supernova- bad.
How's that coming?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Fine.
- You sure?
- Yep.
I, um-
You probably thought that was
some form of latent hostility.
What in the world
would give me that idea?
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
-  Are you kidding?
I distinctly remember
you walked out my door, ergo-
I was ready for the next step.
You weren't. Ergo, I walked.
It was a little more complicated
than that.
I just wanted
to share an apartment.
What was so complicated about that?
- There were a lot of variables to consider.
There was you and me.
No variables, no math.
It was actually the simplest thing in the world.
- But like always, Reed, your head got in the way.
- No, it didn't.
Then what was it?
Did you feel anything when I left?
Do you feel anything right now?
I think we have a serious problem.
Thank you.
- How are you feeling?
- Fine. I'm good.
Thank you for
coming out to see me.
- You said it was urgent, so-
- It is.
There's, uh, something
we need to talk about.
Something I need
to ask you.
Victor, wait a second. Um, I appreciate
everything you've done for me...
- but I think it's a bad
idea for us to get involved.
- Just listen.
What are you doing?
I didn't bring you here...
to talk about us.
Please, this is business.
I need to know, how close is Reed
to finding a cure?
He's been working
'round the clock.
- The data needs to be
tested and analyzed before-
- Same old Reed.
All analysis, no action.
Wasn't that the problem
with you two?
If the molecules aren't stable, it could
make us worse- maybe even kill us.
Then why is Reed
dragging his feet?
Maybe he likes having
his prize specimen under a glass.
It's ironic,
isn't it?
You're finally the perfect woman for him
because you're his science project.
- Please don't make this a personal matter.
- I think you already have.
Victor, we can't do anything
until the research is ready.
"We"?
Don't forget who
you work for, Susan.
So get to work
and do your job.
I wish my wife
would disappear.
And it's changing into?
I don't really know.
Some kind of organic metallic alloy.
Stronger than titanium
or carbon steel.
Like the shields
Reed said would protect us.
How long?
At this rate, the infection could be
complete in two, maybe three weeks.
What do you mean, complete?
I wish I could tell you.
I can't pretend to know
what we're dealing with here.
- I'll have to notify the C.D.C.
- What?
- I know what it is.
If this thing is contagious,
we may have a big problem on our hands.
Look at me.
I have a life. I'm the... face
of a billion-dollar company.
We need to keep this confidential.
Victor, this disease is progressive,
degenerative. I have to notify someone.
-
- That's terrible news.
I think I'll get a second opinion.
so they can transform like us...
becoming invisible, changing size on demand
or remaining impervious to flame.
You guys look like an '80s rock band.
You know, Ben,
this material stretches.
- I'm sure I can figure out a way to make it fit.
-
I wouldn't be caught dead
wearing that.
I love these costumes! They're missing
something, though. Needs, like, spice-
- They're not costumes.
- You can't use your powers in public, Johnny.
You guys are worse than NASA.
Johnny-
Maybe it's missing a utility belt.
If we can build a machine to recreate
the storm, we can reverse the polarity.
- And reverse the mutations.
- Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
But we're the focus,
right, Reed?
- Yeah, of course. Of course.
- Because last time it didn't work out so well.
- With the right amount...
of energy we can stabilize
the storm.
Maybe tie in
to the city grid.
You know, you really
need a janitor.
I bet this is what it looks like
inside your head.
- Oh!
- Sue!
-
- My fault.
- No problem.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Did it just get really hot in here?
- Yeah. It-Yeah.
It's weird.
Yeah, it's-Whoo.
Whoo!
- Is this your floor?
- No. I was gonna- It's broken or somethin'.
- You guys goin' up?
- Is it hot in here?
Yes.
Listen, I'll call you
about that drink, okay?
- Good-bye.
- Bye-bye.
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
It's like a sauna in here.
It's been like this
all day.
- Oh, my-
- It's the Invisible Woman!
I can't believe
I'm doing this again!
All right, I'm here. Let's make this quick.
I got places to go today.
-
- Oh, wait.  I don't go anywhere.
Johnny, it's imperative that we
stay inside for the foreseeable future.
Johnny, it's too dangerous
for you to be in public.
You've been saying that for years.
What worries me
is that our powers are evolving.
I know I know!
- You can't fly.
- Yet.
- Johnny, can you put that napkin out?
- Oh, Jesus.
What's going on?
How you gonna cure us?
I'm gonna build a machine
to re-create the storm.
It'll return us back to normal.
- Huh.
Even a small miscalculation could
increase our symptoms exponentially.
-
- Or perhaps even kill us.
- So, how long till this
contraption's up and runnin'?
- It's hard to say.
- How long, Reed?
- I don't know-
know?
- You don't want this to get worse.
- Worse than

- Ohh!

Sorry!
