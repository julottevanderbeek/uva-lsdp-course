when the fierce and beautiful land of
Alagaesia ...
To protect and serve
was their mission.
And for thousands of years
the people prospered.
And began to fight among
themselves for power.
Sensing their weekness, a young rider
named Galbatorix, betrayed them.
Since then, our land has been
ruled by Galbatorix.
including the freedom fighters
known... as The Varden.
Those that survived
fled to the mountains.
There, they hoped for a miracle,
that might even their odds against the king.
rides for her life.
Carrying a stone...
I suffer without my stone.
Do not prolong my suffering.
Miles away, a young boy
ventures out hunting.
You've lost!
Give it to me!
- Durza.
And I let you live.
Is there anyone who trusts
the word of a shade?
Where did you send it?
Poor Durza...
How will you tell the king...
you failed.
Two more patriotic volunteers
for the king's army.
My sons are not fighters.
The men you take they never return.
Every village must do its share.
Rejoice...
your sons will be heroes.
Expensive taste Eragon?
The king's trip.
Best cut there is.
The fat just...melts into the meat.
How much?
How much?!
Too much for a poor farmboy.
I have something.
Something to trade.
What is this?
Some kind of stone?
I've found it.
- Stoled it more likely.
I was hunting...
hunting in the spine.
Put it back.
It belongs to the king.
Tell no one you have it.
You've endangered the whole village.
Now get out!
I don't need that sort of trouble here.
Get...Get out!
Look at this!
A necklace.
Now where the two like you find
such an appetizing string of jewels?
Interesting you should ask.
- Is that right?
I was walking up the land the other day,
admiring them sitting on a branch.
Clap a thunder,
they fell off, there at my feet.
So I thought:
well, can't leave 'em there.
Someone might trip.
So I hang them up there all the way.
You know what I think?
- What's that?
I think you're a thief...
A poacher.
- Oh, no.
I confiscate them all, in the name of the king.
Don't try...
Well, I just cut down for you then, shall I?
Got those.
Sorry I didn't pluck 'em.
Take care with the little bones.
Hate to see you choke.
Oh, hell, Eragon,
the mighty hunter returns.
Oh, yeah...
...with his invisible catch.
What happened?
Did you get scared when the deer grout?
No respect for the hunter?
- Whoa...
Don't you ever learn ?
Shall we have another lesson today?
Fight like an old goat boar...
Hey, my breakfast!
You too slow, Roran.
- Wake up dreamer!
That sounded like your head...
Hey, come on boys,
that's enough!
Come on, Roran.
Eragon...
I'm leaving.
I'm old enough to be recruited now.
Before the soldiers come looking for me.
I won't serve in the army.
I'll send word when I've settled.
But...what...
- He knows.
I already told him.
Where will you go?
Don't know yet.
All I know is I'm going.
Roran...!
Eragon...!
Come on.
Roran told you then?
Your day will come too, Eragon.
And you will decide for yourself
the kind of life you wish to lead.
Uncle, I like my life...
right here.
What many men seek is often
right under their nose.
But for some...
the unknown is too hard to resist.
Is that why my mother left?
My sister was in a great
hurry when she left you here.
Whatever her reasons, we can only trust,
they were for your own good.
Besides...had she not...
I wouldn't have gained another son.
Take these.
I've been saving them for you.
Your blessing is all I need.
Take care of yourself, Roran.
Goodbye, Father.
Be strong...
Brother.
And welcome that aim.
You may make a hunter yet.
Not a stone...
An egg!
Look at you...!
What are you?
Well...you're not a bird.
Where is it?
Too late...
it's hatched.
Look at what you did!
Hungry?
Go on...
Drink while it's still warm.
Sorry...
That's all there is.
So much for our rat problem...
My king, Galbatorix.
As you feared, the dragon has hatched.
But to a mere farmboy.
To whom, is not the issue.
When The Varden learned that the legend is real
they will be encouraged to challenge me.
And I am not interested
in being challenged.
There is no one left,
for you to fear, my king.
Beyond these borders,
are remnants of the resistant.
Dwarves, Elves, The Varden.
I can't let them have hope.
Do not let them reach The Varden.
I will find the boy.
And kill him,
before he becomes a man.
Where is your mother?
Did she abandon you, too?
Did she leave in a great hurry?
Rasack!
Rasack!
Rasack!
Kill the rider!
Nothing from my voice.
Not a word.
Their mother's heart be broken.
And for what?
More death?
More suffering?
Easy Horst!
The soldiers will hear you.
What's that matter?
Speak, or not speak...
It makes no difference.
Quite Brom.
A fool like you has nothing to loose.
No argument there...
Don't mind me.
But it wasn't always like this,
was it?
There was a time when our land
flourished without cruelty and fear.
The time of dragons
and dragonriders.
Those days are long gone.
*They only live in Brom's stories...*
*You know exactly what I'm talking about*
*Men stride magnificent beasts...*
No one could defeat them.
Until...there was one of their own...
A rider named, Galbatorix.
Decided to take all
the power for himself...
and cut down any dragonrider opposed him.
Enough!!!
Before you're hung by a tree.
No!
Let him finish!
And one day he will pay for his crime.
Are you deaf!
Be on your way!
The time of dragonriders...
will come again.
First...
I think you need to fly.
You did it!
She's gone.
The time of the dragonriders
has come again.
You can hear my thoughts?
I have waited a thousand years
to hear your thoughts.
- Rider?
- Get out!
Is it true?
What you've spoke of?
-Didn't you hear me?
- Get out!
- I want to know more.
Please...
tell me about the dragons.
Did anybody follow you here?
How big will they grow?
When do they breath fire?
Sssshhhh....
Keep your voice down!
You mocked the king...
in front
of the soldiers.
I always say...
better ask forgiveness, than permission.
Then tell me!
Tell me about the dragons.
- Go home!
Mind your corn,
tend your fields, right?
You just get yourself into trouble.
Was it made you then?
A liar or a coward?
I know...
I know your story is true.
I told you...
his name is Eragon.
The boy...
the boy...took it with him.
He lives on a farm...
the furthest one in the back.
Eragon!
It's you they want!
Take me down.
- You're in danger.
What are you doing?
I have to warn my uncle.
What are you doing?
I have to warn my uncle.
It's too late, there's
nothing you can do.
Hold on!
You're ridiculous!
Hold on!
I'm begging you please put me down now.
- I can't! They'll kill you!
Put me down now!
- You stupid boy!
I'm slipping!
Put me down now!
You're giving me
no choice.
Uncle?
Uncle!
Eragon?
I should've been here...
to warn him.
It is your fault!
- But you would've met the same fate.
No!
I could have saved him.
Go away!
And stay away!
Uncle, I'm sorry.
No!
You?
- Let go of me.
Where is your dragon?
- Gone.
What do you mean gone?
- I sent her away.
Are you gonna stay here? I know they'll be back for you.
I'm not going anywhere...
not until I bury him.
There...
- What are you doing?
Funeral, fit for a king.
Let go.
Listen! They've killed him,
but they were after you.
If we stay here, we're both death.
Now, get on that horse.
Go on!
Get up there!
Who are you?
- Ride, now, go on!
Come on boy, ride!
Why here?
- Because I said, here.
Call your dragon.
- My uncle was killed because of her.
She was protecting you
against the Razak.
I could've killed them.
- That's the spirit.
One part brave, three part fool.
What?
You don't think I could do it?
A Razak kill mercylessly.
That's what they do.
But a boy of fifteen...sixteen...
Seventeen!
Seventeen. Forgive me!
Well I think even a seventeen-year-old boy...
might probably last a minute,
against Durza's assasins.
Then I'll find Durza, and kill him.
Durza is a shade.
A sourcerer.
Possessed with demonic spirits.
Find Durza...huh...
You'll be no better off than your uncle.
You  just pray to heaven he doesn't find you.
Cause the king won't rest,
until he does.
You are The Varden's only hope.
Who are The Varden?
- Rebels, outcasts...
Men who are brave or...
mad enough to oppose Galbatorix.
They were the stronghold
in the Boar mountains.
How do you know all this?
Because I've been a part of it.
I've seen things...
You could never imagine.
Now, call your dragon.
She is far away by now...
She can't hear me.
Shall we have an aggreement,
not to lie to each other.
I know she hears your thoughts.
Now, call your dragon.
- I'm so sorry for what I've said.
- I understand.
- He knows about dragon.
- He...knows about dragons...
Muscular...
graceful proportions.
Talons...
Nice big curve...
Legs are bit thin...
- Only my voice is gentle,
old man.
Spikes...
sharp...
All in all...
a fine young dragon.
- Well...he does know...
a bit about dragons.
And soon...
strong enough to ride.
Not me. I won't do it again.
My story was about you, Eragon.
It is your fate to be a dragonrider.
The Varden need a rider...
If they're to defeat Durza and the king.
I didn't ask for any of this.
- But you were chosen, nevertheless.
A dragon will only hatch,
if it feels the presence of its rider.
It'll wait forever if it has to.
And now it's found you,
it will serve you, and only you...
and that's why your life is in danger.
Because it chose me?
No.
Because the easiest way for the king
to destroy your dragon...
is to kill you.
A rider will live on
if its dragon is killed...
but if a rider dies...
Handsome blade.
Simple...
until a point.
The farmboy evaded the Razak.
Bring me his hand.
Durza will send his urgalls after us.
I had five hard days ride
as the river down at Daret.
The last outpost before you reach the foothills.
Now if we can get there, without being discovered
we have a chance.
Tell Saphira, to fly above us and scout
the countryside for urgalls.
Or worst, Razaks...
If they find us we'll have no chance.
And tell her:
only to come to us at night.
Do as he says.
This way.
Urgalls. They used to be the king's enemies.
Now they're his guard!
They were faster than I thought.
We gotta stay off the roads.
Why can't we take 'em?
- Quiet!
You're not ready to take anything yet.
I have skills.
I can fight.
My cousin...
Roran and I...
we've trained.
With swords.
- Well, then...
perhaps I underestimated you.
Right then..
and see these skills of yours.
You know, this won't be virtual then.
*Humor me...*
Oh dear...
wanna see the effect of your training?
Good...Good...
Don't get...
...over confident.
It won't be your cousin Roran
you're fighting.
And it won't be wooden staves either.
I could've beaten him,
but I didn't want to hurt the old man.
Of course you could've...
- Don't dragons breath fire?
She is not old enough to sustain flame.
Brizinge.
How did you do that?
What did you just do?
I...started the fire.
Now get to sleep.
With any luck tomorrow,by the end of the day,
we would have slipped through Daret unseen.
Then it's the foothills of the Boar mountains
on a straight shot...
to The Varden.
Eragon, wake up, come on, wake up.
We are at the village of Daret.
We leave the horses here.
Keep Saphira close.
Rice and bread...down there.
Come back meet me here,
it won't be long.
Don't talk to anybody.
Do you wish Angela to read your fortune?
But I have no money.
- Did Angela ask for money?
Knuckle bones of a dragon.
They would tell me everything about you.
This is difficult...
A young life so tangled...
but you have been long awaited by many races.
Great battles waved around you.
Can't be.
I don't understand.
You have powers you do not acknowledge.
But there is a doom upon you.
Part of it lies in death...that rapidly approaches.
No...
It's only happened.
And a girl...
she calls to you...in your dreams.
She is part of your past.
...and your future.
Who is she?
Tell me her name.
Do I have to do everything by myself?
- The fortuneteller...
Did she tell you about him?
Come on!
Where's everybody gone?
She told of our future.
The future is for the living, Eragon.
Come on!
Saphira.
Brizinge!
My hand...
burns.
Slowly, slowly, slowly ...
My head...
feels like I've been kicked by a horse.
What happened?
Most new dragonriders take years to learn
what you've discovered by instinct. .
What was that?
- Magic.
I was only reacting.
Magic...comes from dragons.
Flows through the riders who command.
Saphira.
- She is fine.
But she felt your fear,
as her own.
Your bound with her is strong.
Those were Urgers, weren't they?
- Yes.
Did I kill them?
- Yes.
But death is nothing to celebrate.
Magic...must be your last resort.
It has rules,
it has...limitations.
Before you cast a spell,
you must learn the ancient language of the Elves.
Brizinge?
- Brizinge...
Means fire..is fire.
The thing is the word.
Know the word,
and you controll the thing.
Before you can cast a spell...
you must have the physical strength
to stand its effect.
Some spells will leave you weakened.
Other spells...
as you found out on the bridge...
will leave you unconscious.
And yet other spells
if you use them before you are ready...
will kill you.
I can teach you the words...
but the limit of your strength...
you must learn yourself.
What's the word for "tree"?
- Tree is Traevan.
And a branch?
- Gevaister.
Gevaister.
And when a dragon and rider are truly one,
and they see as one...
And that's...
Skulvlaqueswenn.
Skulvlaqueswenn.
Well, since we've announced ourselves
so spectecularly to the world,
we're gonna have to find
another way through these hills.
Course...
that would be a lot easier...
if you were flying...
Are you ready to try again?
Dragonrider?
That's not so bad up here.
Yeah!
Feel how she moves, Eragon.
How she turns.
And when she accelerates.
- Come on, let's see what you've got.
You want speed?
Here we go.
You asked for it.
- Let her go!
- I wanna try it.
Oh, it's easy, I can do it.
Maybe I can try this.
Skulvlaqueswenn
Fantastic!
You always see like this?
- That's nothing...
watch this...
What's wrong?
Razacks!
Brom!
This time they die.
Now go!
With pleasure.
Come on, come on...
Eragon, stay out of this!
Lower, Saphira, lower!
Gevaister!
Eragon!
Above you!
Protect your dragon.
Your irresponsibility could
cost Saphira her life.
Don't worry about me.
I'm stronger than he thinks.
You don't listen to anything I tell you?
Better to ask forgiveness
than permission.
Your duty is to reach The Varden alive.
Let's talk about truth, before we start
talking about duty.
What do you talking about?
I thought we agreed...
not...
to lie to one another.
Dragonrider.
Not anymore.
Where is your dragon?
Dead.
She was murdered by another rider.
With this sword.
Azarog.
Rider's name...
was Morzan.
Galbatorix won him over.
And while she was trying to protect me...
my dragon was killed.
So I...set out to search for Morzan.
And I found him.
I took his sword...
and I drove it through his heart.
And as he died, so did his dragon.
The last...
except for the king's.
So I hid out in Carvago.
With a shame...
I rightly deserved.
Because of me...
the days
of the dragonriders...
were over.
And you came...
you both... came.
the days of the riders
have come again.
Bring me the boy, I said.
Bring me his blood...
I said.
But you...
you bring me...
nothing!
You...
congratulations.
You've just been promoted.
I thought of this.
I'll bring the boy to me.
Tell me your name.
Eragon.
Eragon.
I am Arya, princess of Alaesmeria.
We are allies with the Varden.
You are the only one who can save me.
But how'll I find you?
- Durza holds me prisoner.
At Giliat.
Where're you going?
- To find Arya.
How do you know that name?
- She's Durza's prisoner.
I'm going to free her.
- That's out of the question.
Giliat is the opposite direction.
We can't start going back,
we're almost there.
I won't let you do that.
It's too much of a risk.
That egg was sent to me.
I'll decide what risk I'll take, not you.
Eragon, this is more than about "just us".
If I don't, she'll be killed.
Yes, and it's a sacrifice
she is happy to make.
Look, she values your life over hers.
I won't let her die.
- If she dies...
then she'll join the countless others,
who died waiting for you.
As The Varden now wait for you.
You must try to understand,
it's your life that's important.
I do understand.
- One false move...
one reckless decision...
and everything is lost.
Eragon, listen to me.
- Your shame is not mine.
You forgot what it
means to be a dragonrider.
I will save her.
-Eragon?
- Please don't, Saphira.
I'm the rider, and I say we go!
You drew too much attention,
we'll have to wait for night...
Not today.
Not for us.
I'm going to save her life.
I can do this.
Our power is greatest when
we're together.
We can't truly be together, until
I become as strong as you.
Skulvlaqueswenn.
Mahrmohr.
Eragon!
You shouldn't have come!
But in the woods...
- Leave me here.
Go...Now...
- It's far too late for that.
Forgive me if I stare.
I knew you were young,but even then
I expected someone a little more...
well, more.
Brizinger!
A young magician...
how quaint...
Do you already feel it draining your strength?
They say, as a dragonrider draws his last breath...
he can hear the dying screams of his dragon.
No!
You have to do much better than that.
Get out.
- No...not without you.
Come on, let's go!
Take Azarog!
Saphira, can you carry three?
- Not for very long.
I suggest you leave quickly.
Come on, let's get out of here!
Higher! They're on the roof!
- I can't.
The weight is too much.
Eragon.
Durza...Durza...
Durza is dead.
- Did you pierce him through the heart?
You can only kill a shade,
if you pierce him through the heart.
We must get help.
- Where?
From the Varden.
- Yes...go to the Varden.
Take this.
Go...
without me...
No...
I need you.
- No, Eragon.
It's I, who've always needed you.
You gave me my life back again.
Take care of Saphira.
Without her...
you'll find life it's hardly worth living.
I won't let you die.
Not for my mistake.
Laise!
Hale!
You're not strong enough...
Yet.
That's the spirit.
One part brave...three parts fool.
Forgive me.
Eragon.
Let him die with pride...
Who'll remember him?
Many people will...
because of you.
I need you to get you to The Varden.
How do I find them?
This one's been following us.
- Stand up.
All my life I've dreamed of dragons.
Who are you?
And why're you following us?
I'm Murtagh.
And you need me, dragonrider.
Thanks, but I'll be fine without you.
- You seek The Varden.
I know the mountains.
Every valley and stream.
She'll suffer if you go straight.
Why did you risk your life for us?
My family was slaughtered by
the king's men when I was a boy.
I heard rumours...
They said a rider had appeared.
- Eragon.
If there were ever a time for retribution...
this was it.
If you could show me
the quickest way to The Varden...
To the Varden it is.
You'll learn to trust me, dragonrider.
I'm not the only one you need to convince.
We'll have to go by foot from here.
Saphira.
Keep Arya safe until I call you.
- I will.
But hurry, the Urgers are closing in.
Thanks...Again...
Don't mention...
Tell me your vision looks something like this.
Come on.
Your task was simple.
Bring the boy to me.
But there were...complications.
- Yes, so I've heard.
Complications do tend to happen...
but fortunately for you,
your incompetence may work in my favour.
The boy's led us directly to The Varden.
And so the job falls upon you, Durza...
to remind those...
who resist my rule,
that as long as I am king...
this loyalty will be punishable, by death.
Gather my army and follow them.
Leave no one alive!
Which one of you is the rider?
- I am! my name is Eragon.
I am Ajihad,
Leader of The Varden.
If you are the rider,
call your beast inside.
If it attacks, you'll die first.
Saphira, bring Arya.
But be cautious.
Where is Arya?
- She is holding on.
She's been poisoned... by a shade.
Our healers will make her well.
Watch over Arya...
Urgers...are scouting the mountain as we speak.
Time is short...
I must know if you're with us?
We'll be greatly outnumbered.
We've come to join you.
Seize him!
- Leave him!
He's with me.
He saved my life.
He is the son of Morzan,
the traitor.
Is it true?
- A son doesn't choose his father.
This was the only thing he ever gave me.
I hated that man until the day he died.
Lock him up!
If he tries to escape, kill him.
Let go of me...
I have no time to take chances...
The Urger's presence here can only mean
that the king's men are not far behind.
These cowards will hide no more.
Tonight we destroy the resistance.
But the boy is mine.
Excuse me, I should've knocked.
It's fine.
My father asked me to bring you to him.
I'll be ready in just a moment.
Arya has responded well
to our healers work.
*Has strength deep.*
- When can I see her?
She's resting now.
Only she can answer that.
They're afraid of me.
Why wouldn't they be?
There is no retreats from here, nowhere else to hide..
The suspicion has kept us alive all these years.
When words spread of a new dragonrider...
we were expecting someone who was more....
well...
- More than me...
I've heard it before.
Your armor is ready for you.
We must prepare for battle.
It's not as easy...
as it looks. Is it?
You look...
fit for battle!
Be strong, Eragon.
The search for a rider has been long and dangerous.
Some of us...
have carried the egg
for as long as we can remember hoping it would hatch.
And fate...
finally carried it to you.
Why me?
I'm just a farmboy from Calvo.
Because that...is who
Saphira chose.
I barely even recognize myself.
They worked through the night.
To protect our greatest hope.
And our leader, who rides her.
Ready the archers!
I need to know, Saphira.
Why me?
But I'm not without fear.
And are we together, Saphira?
As one?
Take that as a "yes"!
Now!
Into the sky,
to win or die!
Fire!
Yeah!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out of here!
No!
Time to return the favour!
Come!
Taste the blood of your dragon!
Let's finish this!
What is that thing?
- Dark magic.
Closer, so we can reach his heart.
- This time, rip it out of his chest.
Saphira.
Hear her scream!
Saphira, you're hurt!
- Don't worry about me.
You go mind in the fight.
Skulvlaqueswenn.
What's happening?
My vision's failing.
Easy, Saphira.
We gonna get through this...together.
I know what I have to do.
Now!
That's for Brom!
I expected more.
Saphira!
Saphira...
Whatever life...
there is in me...
take it!
- Eragon...no!
Even in you, don't have a heart...
strong enough...for
both of us.
Laise!
Hael!
Slowly, rider.
Saphira?
Some friends can't be replaced.
But luckily some don't have to be.
Saphira!
I didn't think I could do it.
Wasn't it an old, wise man who one said...
one part brave, three parts fool?
And Arya?
- Thought that might come up.
Get changed!
She is up to Alaesmeria.
What horse was ever born
that could out run a dragon?
You never gave me a chance to say goodbye.
There was no time.
Galbatorix will try to avenge this defeat.
I must return to my people in Alaesmeria.
And you must prepare The Varden.
You lost those who were dear to you.
You've payed a great price for your courage.
Did your people of The Varden already tell stories about you?
Legend of Eragon,
the great Shade Slayer...
is pressed throughout Alagaesia.
You know how legends go...
People believe just about anything these days.
When will I see you again?
Time goes quickly.
Only yesterday, you were a farmboy...
today you are a hero.
Tomorrow...
may see us together again.
Then I'll be waiting for tomorrow.
Take care of him, Saphira.
Come!
