Mike.
Chagarin's making
a move on Komarov.
Shit.
I'll see if we got local.
McClane.
Hey, Murph, how you doing?
Nice grouping, Grandpa.
Yeah, not bad.
Is that it?
Yep. We found him.
It's not good, John.
Hospital or morgue?
Worse.
When was the last time
you spoke to this kid?
It's been a while.
Maybe a few years, even.
Last time I saw him,
it was pretty ugly.
Well, there's
a few different
versions in there,
but my people are pretty sure
he's being held
at a Moscow prison
awaiting sentencing.
What's he charged with?
It's a nasty sheet.
He'll be lucky
to get life.
He can never get
out of his own way.
He had a lot of problems.
He's still my kid.
I know.
But it's Russia.
They do things
differently over there.
Me, too.
Good luck, Poppy.
Thanks, kid.
WOMAN ON PA:
LUCY: Dad, I wish you
would let me go with you.
You would never
be able to resist
the urge to tell me
what to do all the time.
This isn't your fault.
You know?
I just
hoped that he'd
figured his life out.
I got you something.
"Idiot's Travel Guide."
Perfect.
Thank you, baby.
I love you.
I love you, too.
See you soon.
Dad?
Just try,
try not to make an even
bigger mess of things.
Good luck.
I love you.
See you soon.
...Draganskiy courthouse?
You speak Russian?
How did I do?
Well, you asked for
a large bag of hair
on the way to
Taganskaya courthouse.
But I got it.
I got it.
Good.
Traffic sucks here,
too, huh?
Sex?
You want sex? Sexy clubs?
No. No sex.
It sucks,
this traffic.
What is it? An accident?
No.
Garden Ring. Is bad.
Always traffic,
always traffic.
You're American?
Yeah, American. New York.
The Big Apple.
That's it.
Frank Sinatra.
Chairman of the Board.
That's right.
The Chairman. Yeah.
You sing good.
Yes, I sing.
I sing all the time.
Yeah.
Huh?
Heap. "Top of the heap."
All right, all right.
Taganskaya courthouse,
right there.
Two blocks.
You better walk,
traffic is bad.
Really bad.
What do I owe you?
Hey, no money.
No money, you let me sing.
You let me sing.
You listen to my singing.
No money.
Welcome to Moscow.
CABBIE:
SINATRA:
MALE REPORTER:
FEMALE REPORTER:
Security is tight,
as there have been
several attempts
on Komarov's life
since he's been in prison.
Detonator.
Detonator.
It's gonna be loud.
Hey!
Jack!
Dad?
Get out of the van!
What are you doing here?
Jack! Hey!
McCLANE: Jack!
Shit.
Go home.
What the fuck
do you think...? Jack!
You're out of
your depth, John.
Jack! What are you doing?
No! No!
Jack!
You're gonna shoot me?
You're gonna
shoot your own father?
You shouldn't be here, John.
You shouldn't be here.
What are you doing?
Jack!
Whoa!
You're gonna
fucking run over me?
You're only making it worse!
Jack.
Get out of the way!
Call a cop!
Reaper One?
Reaper One from 6-1-0.
Who's got him?
Clock's running. Foxy.
On the paper now. Box on.
Copy that. Box on.
MAN:
Reaper, how are we looking?
Your guy is late.
His rate of
progress is way off.
MET now plus 6 minutes.
MCC Reaper. MET now plus 6.
This is
un-frigging-believable.
MCC Reaper.
That's not how it works.
Something's off.
I know this guy.
This doesn't happen.
MCC Reaper,
Stand by.
your window is closed.
Time on target is no-go.
I say again, TOT is no-go.
Reaper, this is real-world,
not exercise, do you copy?
No, sir,
Moscow police will have
shut down the Garden Ring.
Reaper!
He's no-go for extraction.
It's too late. Shut it down.
Pull it!
MAN:
Reaper is out of here.
Come on!
Shit!
Get me Operations.
Reaper!
Get Mike Collins looped in.
Tell him it's Plan B,
safehouse. Go now!
Plan B. No choice.
Shit.
It's blown.
They shut the Garden Ring.
Harvest is in effect.
Keep on working.
Let's finish this, Foxy.
Damn you, McClane!
Damn you!
Oh, fuck!
Jack!
I'm not done talking to you!
Who is this?
Come on, go!
Concentrate, please.
That's right,
come on through, yeah!
See if you can hit this guy!
Jesus!
I'm tired of this guy.
RPG now!
Jesus!
You missed!
Interesting choice, man.
Hey, hey!
Hey!
Whoa!
Hey! Whoa!
Come on!
You gotta be
fucking kidding me!
What?
Do you think I understand
a word you're saying?
Jesus Christ.
It's okay,
I'm fine, thanks.
Oh, man, you're
driving like my grandma!
When I say drive,
I mean fly!
Oh, yeah!
Get out of the way!
Oh, God.
Jesus!
Oh, for the love of...
Hi, honey.
LUCY:
Sorry, ma'am!
Sorry!
Did you see this guy?
LUCY:
Oh, man!
Knock knock.
You still there?
Uh, yep, looking right at him.
I haven't really
caught up with him yet,
but he looks good.
I'm gonna have
to call you back.
Luce,
can I call you right back?
Guess who!
I've had enough of this shit.
Oh, man, hey!
McCLANE: Is that it?
Is that your best shot?
Damn you, John.
Damn you!
Hey! Up here!
Shoot up here!
John! Get in!
Get in before
I change my mind.
Jesus!
Take your time.
Jack,
what the fuck was that, huh?
Shut up.
Shut up, John.
I swear to God,
I will put
a bullet in you this time.
Who do you think
you're talking to?
The last person I want to see.
Well, maybe you missed
the whole part back there
where I saved you
and Papa Geppetto here
from a whole bunch
of Russian bad guys.
You saved? You saved?
That's right, saved.
Shut up.
Shut up.
You're a world class screw-up,
you know that, John?
I'm a screw-up?
I'm a screw-up?
I'm still your father.
Yeah,
nothing I can do about that.
What a joke.
Just shut up.
Try not to touch anything,
all right?
You've done
enough goddamn damage.
John McClane.
Let's go.
After you.
Yeah, I got him.
Okay, I'm on it.
Look, Mike,
we had an unexpected delay.
I'm sorry.
I understand.
This is the last guy on earth
I expected to see.
Listen to me, Yuri,
you have half of Moscow
looking for you.
I need you to get dressed.
Why am I here?
Please put on these clothes.
Trust me.
This is the key to your cuffs.
Take these.
Oh, my Jesus.
Are you okay?
What?
Do you have
the file on Chagarin?
This is what you
been doing, Jack?
Spy shit?
This is it?
You're a spy? Oh, my God.
The 007 of Plainfield,
New Jersey.
Very nice.
McClane, shut up.
Take it easy, Oddjob.
I'm on vacation.
Your mom will be pleased.
We thought you were
doing drugs or something.
Mr. Komarov.
Or selling drugs,
but that was me, really.
Do you have
the file on Chagarin?
Yes, or no?
It's very simple, Yuri.
You give me the file,
and I get you out of Russia.
And you're a free man.
What do you say?
It's not about me.
I don't care about my life.
Well, that's the deal.
It's the only deal.
Come on.
Come on, Yuri. Help yourself.
What's it gonna be?
Yes or no?
The clock is ticking, Yuri.
Come on.
You will get me out of here?
Only the three of you?
Whoa, Nijinsky.
I'm not in the gang.
I just got off the plane.
I'm still jet-lagged.
I'm not involved in this.
Huh, Jack?
Only if I can take
my daughter with me.
Chagarin's people
will kill her.
Fine. Make it quick.
Ah.
Where's the file?
It's in a vault in Prypiat,
but the key
is here in Moscow.
At Hotel Ukraina.
Make your call.
We're going to the Ukraina,
let's go.
Mike, listen, I'm sorry
about this morning, man.
It's fine.
Okay, let's go.
Contact!
Down! Get down!
Go! Get down! Go, go, go!
JACK: John, cover!
Come on, buddy!
Go! Go!
That's right, jerk-off!
All right, let's move, John!
I'm on fucking vacation!
Come on, time to hustle.
Watch your head.
McClane, move it.
Get down, Yuri. Stay low!
Head down.
Come on. Go, go!
Safe house, my ass.
He knows how old we are, no?
Come on.
Here, here, here.
Sit down.
You're all right.
Let me look at you.
It's all right.
You're fine.
What are you doing?
Jack.
Calm down, Yuri, okay?
You're gonna be just fine.
Here, put this on, stay warm.
What was that, John?
Five minutes?
Five minutes?
You blew a three-year op
in five minutes!
You're welcome!
What do you want me to do?
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.
I'm so fucking burned.
I got no friends in
this town anymore.
What about your
people at Langley?
Just give them a call.
Give me your phone.
It's a two-year contract
on that phone.
What are you carrying?
Give me that.
All right.
You got any cash on you?
Some American money.
What are you talking about?
We need to keep on moving.
We have to get
this guy to a doctor.
To medical attention, Jack.
The mission stands.
Your mission is
bleeding out over there.
The mission continues.
We go to the hotel.
Come on, let's move.
Let's move.
This is nuts.
What, are you going to go out
and kill somebody else now?
Why all this trouble
for just one guy?
He's a political prisoner.
Not that you care, John,
but it's a matter
of national security,
all right?
He's got the goods to
stop Viktor Chagarin,
and we need that to happen.
Well, great, Jack.
Let's drop him
off at the Embassy,
and we can go home.
Are you kidding me?
After what happened
at the safe house?
Look,
it doesn't work like that,
all right?
It's a huge diplomatic mess,
and I'm a burnable asset.
So, I now need that file
to un-fuck this mission.
Any more questions?
Yeah, just one.
How come you never called
and told me where you were?
Like you'd give a shit.
All right,
hold up, hold up.
Okay, Yuri,
listen to me, all right?
We're almost done.
As soon as we get that key,
we're gonna grab the file,
get you and your daughter
out of Russia, all right?
All right.
Listen to me,
you're doing good.
All right?
I need you to
hang here a second.
Keep an eye on him, John.
Hey, hey.
What is it with
all this "John" shit?
Whatever happened to "Dad?"
Good question.
In Russia, we have
word for men like him.
It means "tough,"
"hard."
In America, it means
"juvenile delinquent."
Is he your only child?
No. I got a daughter, too.
You?
I have only my
When she was little,
I was working all the time.
I believed work was
all that mattered.
I screwed my
kid's life up, too.
You work all the time
around the clock
most of the time,
when you're a cop.
I just thought that
working all the time
was a good thing, you know?
I didn't help him
at all.
It's never too late,
I hope.
Okay, let's go.
All right,
Yuri, which part of the
building is the ballroom in?
Main tower.
Main tower.
Which floor?
Top floor.
Top floor.
What about security?
You remember any guards?
Cameras? Anything like that?
I don't know.
Well,
I need you to remember.
I was in prison
for five years,
how should I know?
Everything could
have changed.
I know.
Just think, all right?
Picture it in your head.
The ballroom
was closed in '89.
I think it's under
construction now.
JACK: So that floor's
unsecured.
KOMAROV: I don't know! Listen!
My daughter is in there.
I'm scared to death,
let's go!
Just calm down, Yuri.
I guess you have
done that before.
Smart.
I could have done it.
Irina?
Irina?
Irina?
Papa.
Irina.
Papa!
That's tender.
Really? I wouldn't know.
Need a hug?
We're not really
a hugging family.
That's right.
The young one
works for CIA.
The old one is his father.
Americans.
There's something
no good about this.
Just shut up,
all right?
I'm telling you, Jack,
this smells bad.
Just stop, okay?
This might seem like a totally
foreign concept, you know?
I know you love
to just run in,
making shit up.
But like any professional,
I have a plan.
So let's just
stick to it, okay?
Just move your plan along.
All right, Yuri, come on.
Let's grab the key,
get out of here.
Yes.
Just take a moment.
How you doing?
Fine.
How did you get
over here so quick?
Well...
I took Garden Ring.
Oh, the Garden Ring.
Supposed to
always be bad, right?
Hey, John.
Did you get stuck in traffic?
I have it! I have it.
Welcome, Americans.
Put your goddamn
guns down, asshole!
Give me your weapons.
Come and get them.
Really?
Really.
Papa.
Yuri.
Do it.
I thought you were
a problem child.
This a part of your plan,
Mr. Professional?
But,
I'm your father.
And I am your daughter.
We should kill
the old man now.
We still need him.
But them you can kill.
Thank you.
Hi.
I don't know if I'm
saying this right.
Hi.
Do you know what I hate
about the Americans?
Everything.
Especially cowboys.
I could have been a dancer.
I swear to God.
But nobody supported me.
You two
have been such a
pain in the ass!
I prefer dancing, really.
But killing is much,
much better than
working in a grocery shop!
Jesus Christ!
Nice one.
You guys. So arrogant.
It's not 1986, you know.
Reagan is dead.
Sorry. Oh, God.
What's funny there?
Can't tell you.
It's not you.
I love these outfits.
You guys are
looking good.
That was enough, thank you.
Let's dance.
Come on! Come on!
Jack!
Remember
the last time we talked
just before you went away?
Oh, no! No, no!
You're not gonna
open up to me
right before we die!
No,
that's not your thing, John.
What's my thing?
Fucking killing bad guys,
that's your thing!
You're not gonna die today!
Go!
Shit!
Fuck.
We're finished, John.
JACK: I can't believe this.
I can't believe this.
This is unbelievable.
Jack. Hey!
Jesus!
Come on!
Let's get out
of this building!
Come on.
Yes.
He's taking us to it.
Yes, sir.
Shit.
That was exciting.
Yeah. Loads of fun.
You wanna go again?
Are you shot?
No.
No, I'm fine.
Let me take a look at that.
It's fine.
Oh, fuck.
I can't believe she betrayed
her father for Chagarin.
I don't understand that.
Someday you will.
Kids.
What's our next move?
I don't know.
You don't know?
I don't know, all right?
I mean, I'm out of moves.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I screwed up.
I blew the mission.
Well, then we're done, right?
Yeah, we're done.
We're done.
We should just go home.
We'll stop by
a little pharmacy
on our way out of Moscow,
get you some Merthiolate
or mercury
and fix up your
little scratches, here.
Get you home.
Get a little toy set.
Get yourself a nice
warm glass of milk
with a little Bosco in it.
Get your CIA slippers.
All right.
What?
I get it.
What the hell are we gonna do?
What's in the file?
Evidence on Chagarin.
Evidence about what?
Chernobyl.
Look, listen to me.
Komarov and
Chagarin used to have this
nasty little
side-racket going on
back in the day.
They siphoned
weapons-grade uranium,
got greedy,
caused the meltdown.
Then, you know, they fell out.
Former partners, bad break-up.
Scumbags.
So, Chagarin had
Komarov thrown in jail.
You know, put him in a hole,
forget about him.
Doesn't have to worry anymore.
So what happened
to rescuesque?
Well, he grew a conscience.
Yeah, well, that figures.
Listen, Chagarin is bad news.
He's the real deal.
If we see this guy in control,
we're gonna see
the whole thing fall apart.
I'm talking terrorism,
WMDs,
nukes.
Someone has to stop him.
Well, that's what we do.
We go out to Chiapep
and we do our thing.
Our thing?
Yeah.
We go out there
and kill a lot of scumbags.
What? You got
something better to do?
All right. Pull it.
You're not gonna cry,
are you?
Just pull it.
Everybody needs a good cry
once in a while, Jack.
Don't be ashamed.
Pull it.
You remember that time when
you and Ralphie Mauser
were gonna have
that house-painting job?
Got your finger
caught in the ladder,
you cried for
about five, six days.
John, just pull it!
All right.
On three. Here you go.
One, two...
Good God.
Jesus.
When was the last time
you had a tetanus shot?
You all right?
Yeah.
We need a car.
Atta boy.
Back to work.
Hey, Watergate,
how's that lock coming?
Almost there.
Here, try these.
Come on.
Oh, stealing. That's nice.
Real nice, John.
Yeah, I'm up for the
Father of the Year award.
Whoa.
All right.
How'd you know all of these
guns were gonna be here?
It's a Chechen hangout.
Owner doesn't like
guns in the club,
so these bozos leave
them in their cars.
You learn a lot
in three years.
Yeah.
Are we really
going to Chernobyl?
Yeah.
The Chernobyl.
The radioactive joint?
Meltdown?
That's the one.
It's not the Chernobyl
in Switzerland, right?
With all the skiing and
the snow and everything?
You mean Grenoble?
No, sorry,
we're not going to Grenoble.
Eddie Collins's kid
took him on
vacation last year.
They went down to Boca.
Oh, yeah?
Spent four days at the track.
Well, that's nice.
That's relaxing.
Oh, yeah. Sure.
We have to go to Chernobyl?
Yeah, sorry about that.
But all the radioactive stuff
is out, right?
Very touching.
Let's move.
Which one is it?
Couple of fresh coats of paint
and a weedwacker
and it's good to go.
You know,
at first, they denied
anything even happened.
Held a children's
parade the next day
to prove it.
were evacuated.
Never came back.
As soon as they
get in that vault,
Komarov's a dead man.
All right.
You got a plan?
Not really.
I kind of thought
we'd just wing it.
You know,
run in, guns blazing,
making shit up as we go.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What is this? A pirate gun?
Yeah. It's old school, man.
Like you, right?
Yeah, like me.
One of these days,
I'm gonna have
a long talk with you.
Look, Jack,
I'm sorry your
partner got killed.
I'm sorry
I fucked up your day.
That wasn't my plan.
I caused you problems.
You know, I came here
for something else.
And all that other bullshit.
I mean,
I had a pretty good day.
It's fun,
running around with you.
It's good to see you.
I love you, boy.
You, too.
I want you to know
I got your back.
I got yours, too.
All right.
Let's go kill
some motherfuckers.
ALIK: Okay,
what the fuck is this?
I'm losing my patience.
The fucking file
better be here.
KOMAROV: Radiation has
been pooling in this room
for decades.
IRINA: You've underestimated
us, Daddy dearest.
Atta boy.
IRINA: Compound 27-4.
It neutralizes radiation,
trust me.
What's this remind you of?
Newark.
All clear.
We can ditch the suits.
The hell is that?
One billion euros worth
of enriched uranium.
What?
Don't worry,
it's stable in this form.
File!
ALIK: Irina, cut the crap,
please.
No one here is
speaking about uranium.
Where's the file?
No more games,
where is the file?
That's no longer
your concern.
A lot of hardware
for a file.
Yuri!
Yuri.
Where's the dancer?
You okay? You hurt?
No.
I'm good.
I'm all right.
What's in these boxes?
Thank God you're here,
Jack.
We have to leave.
They're coming
back any minute.
Just let me
get the file.
What's in the boxes?
It's U-235.
Weapons-grade uranium.
Armored cases.
The bomb kind?
Yeah, the bomb kind.
Not so fast, Eddie.
Are you crazy?
Yeah, a little bit.
I'm getting the file.
No. No, you're not.
The key.
It's your vault,
isn't it, Yuri?
What? No. No, I...
You put this
shit in here, right?
What? No.
Right?
I didn't know, Jack.
Is that the dancer
down there?
What are you talking about?
That's a tough break
for a good athlete.
Jack, you know me.
Yeah, I know you. I know you.
I know him better.
Never was a file,
was there, Yuri?
Of course there was no file.
It was simply bait.
What I needed
was in this vault.
Chagarin was
the only one with enough
power and influence
to get me out of jail.
I used him.
I used you.
It's about money.
When's it not about money?
You want to arrest me?
You're out of
your jurisdiction,
Detective McClane, aren't you?
I wouldn't worry too much
about being arrested.
See, my boy
is in the CIA.
No phone call.
Spy shit.
Goddamn Americans.
You think you're so smart.
No, I'm not that smart.
I'm just on vacation.
My boy here,
he gonna put
a whooping on you.
Move!
You can say
goodbye to your daughter,
you dumbwit fuck.
Where's your
little Soltschanitsa?
Shit!
God damn it!
Shit!
McCLANE: Jack!
Subtle.
What the hell is in
those goddamn grenades?
Go get him!
I'm going to the helicopter!
McCLANE: Jack!
I'm on fucking vacation!
The shit we do for our kids.
Yippee ki-yay, motherfucker.
Jesus Christ!
Well done,
Mr. Super-spy.
What a shame your father
won't be alive to
see you promoted.
Neither will you.
Hey! Jack!
Hang on, John!
John!
Come on!
John!
John!
John!
John!
Dad!
Right here.
Did you just call me Dad?
No.
I didn't think so.
You're hearing things.
You got swimmer's ear.
We're not gonna grow any
third arms or anything,
are we?
No.
You might lose your hair.
Laugh it up, kid.
This is you,
five years from now.
It's rainwater.
You'll be fine.
Besides,
it's hard to
kill a McClane.
Now you're a McClane?
Yeah, I'm a McClane.
John McClane.
John McClane Junior.
Well,
that makes you
a "senior."
That's right.
Try not to forget it.
I'm your father.
Have some respect
for your father.
Let me ask you something.
Do you go
looking for trouble
or does it always
just seem to find you?
You know,
after all these years,
I still ask myself
the same question.
