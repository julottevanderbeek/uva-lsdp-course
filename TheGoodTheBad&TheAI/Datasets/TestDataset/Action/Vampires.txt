How's it look?
Like a New Mexican shithole.
Perfect spot for a nest.
Let's hit it.
All right. Gio?
Bene dica vow omnipotens deus.
In nomine Patrius, et Filius,
et Spiritus Sanctus. Amen.
-Everything set?
-Ready, boss.
We got a nest
inside this place.
Figure at least six goons,
maybe more.
Chances are,
we'll find the master.
You find the nest, you find the master.
He usually won't leave it.
It's strictly by the book today.
Questions?
Let's get to work.
-I'll do it, boss.
-My turn.
Anthony?
Easy with that door.
Slow...
...and easy.
Sorry, boss.
Jesus!
-What was that?
-I don't know.
Did I wake you, Montoya?
Relax. Dead body.
Bled out and cold.
Dead body.
Bled out and cold.
Suck it up.
Bambi!
Get it off!
Wait! Hold your fire!
Get it off now!
Now! Fire!
-What?
-I don't know. Hang on.
What's going on in there?
Big Deyo, what's going on in there?
We got a live one.
Female goon.
We'll save her for you.
Open wide, baby.
Anthony, stick her!
Clear! Take that!
Ortega, we got a fish! Go!
Go from Montoya.
We're losing him!
Bambi, reload!
Shit!
Catlin!
Safety on, boss!
-Got it?
-Clear! Clear!
Oh, Lord.
Take over.
Come on! Right here.
Die!
Die!
Fucking die! Die!
Fuck it! Not only ugly,
he smells bad. Jeez!
Give me the radio.
-Everybody okay?
-Yeah, boss.
Got another one. He's dead.
Send in the cable.
Give me a minute.
May her soul and the souls
of the departed...
...with the mercy of God,
rest in peace.
Amen.
Nothing like a little head,
eh, Padre?
Okay, boys. Time to mop it up.
Deyo, Ortega, Bambi. Upstairs.
Catlin, Anthony, Davis.
Basement.
Enjoy the barbecue, baby!
One, two, three, four...
...five, six, seven, eight...
...nine! Goons, man!
It's not a bad day's work.
You the man!
What is it, Jack?
Is something wrong?
Yeah. Where was the master?
-Want us to check once more?
-He's not there.
You don't suppose
there's another nest, do you?
Sure as hell better not be.
-Let's get out of here.
-Get the hookers!
Thank you for all your help.
Father, I've spent two weeks
running whores and buying liquor.
-When are they leaving?
-We're clearing out tomorrow.
I can't say that
I'm sorry to hear it.
You get that little package from us?
Yeah, I got it.
Good, then you're happy.
You all work together?
That's right.
What do you do?
We kill vampires.
I briefed Rome.
They're wiring a payment.
-Thanks, Gio.
-Cardinal Alba's flying in.
-He wants to see you tomorrow.
-It's my day off.
Jack. Not anymore.
What happened to the master?
I don't know, Padre.
A master won't leave
a nest filled with goons.
What says he's in New Mexico?
He could be anywhere.
Why would he run? It's not like
he knew we were coming.
No, really. What do you guys do?
I'm not kidding. We kill vampires.
Tell the lady what we do.
Kill vampires. Hunt them down.
Kick the shit out of them.
Right.
I know how you feel, baby.
Nobody believes in vampires.
See, the thing is, we know
vampires are stalking the earth.
We also know there's a God too.
We just don't understand him.
Nice party.
You look like you got something
other than me on your mind.
Feel like telling me about it?
I was looking for something
I didn't find.
That's a pain in the ass.
Maybe you should try
looking somewhere else?
I can tell you where you
might wanna start.
Well, Jesus, you're right.
I should've been looking in
a whole different place.
So why don't you get me
something to drink?
And we can meet back in your...
...room.
That's the first good idea
I heard today.
Deyo, give me a couple beers,
will you?
You're magnificent, you know?
Have I ever told you that?
-Slow down, Padre.
-No, I'm not drunk.
Oh, really?
What are you on, acid?
Doesn't it feel beautiful?
Something you'll never forget.
I know I won't.
I think we're out of beer.
I think we ought to
knock over a liquor store.
Hell, why not?
I don't give a shit anymore.
I got beer.
Got beer in the other room.
Fucking people. I don't know why
I gotta take care of everybody.
And you.
You. You don't go anywhere.
I got plans for you.
Jack Crow.
Quick! The pickup.
Keys!
Come on! Come with me!
Did he bite you?
Wait!
I'll use you. Come here.
Leave her!
She's dead anyway!
Just take her.
I can use her. Go!
Step on it, goddamn it!
-Hit it!
-I'm going!
He's right behind us!
Come on! Go!
Kill him!
You okay?
Can you walk?
You alive? Come on!
Come on.
-What are you doing?
-She's going with us.
He just bit her!
She hasn't turned yet.
Well, she's on her way!
It's under 48 hours.
The telepathic link won't hold.
So what!
She'll start receiving his thoughts,
seeing what he sees!
Exactly.
Like a surveillance camera.
So we can find him and
shove a stick up his ass!
I'm gonna use her to get to the master
and whoever tipped him off.
We were set up.
He knew my fucking name!
-Come on.
-Who set us up?
I don't know,
but I want the son of a bitch.
Can you walk?
Wake up! Can you walk?
Are you with me?
Come on!
Do you hear me? Well?
This ain't my first time
to the dance. Let's go.
Hey, cowboy!
Can I help you?
I'm borrowing your car.
Say, "Help yourself."
-You want me to say what?
-Shut the fuck up!
I'll blow your teeth
out of your head.
Back off!
Help yourself, boy.
Much obliged, partner.
Get in!
Take her to Apache Springs.
Plaza Hotel.
Hole up there.
I'll find you soon.
-Dump this thing. Take the Jeep.
-You can't bury them all.
Get going.
I need to talk to you!
We're wasting time!
Rule number seven:
Never bury a member
by yourself.
Special circumstances.
The team's slaughtered!
-I can handle it!
-Bullshit! You know better.
Got any bright ideas?
We kill the whore, bury the team
and head back to Monterey.
If you wanna pull out...
-...go ahead.
-I didn't say that.
The rules changed.
We'll do whatever it takes.
We got 11 hours
until sundown.
If you got something to say,
spit it out!
I got something to say.
Don't take too fucking long!
I get nervous
when you're not around.
-How you doing? I need a room.
-For how long?
A few days.
It's $375 a week.
Plus $25 for your cable TV.
-What's the fucking total, guy?
-That's $400.
Is that your girlfriend?
No, it's my fucking mother.
Give me the key.
Come on. Take my arm.
Hey, wake up, will you?
Let's go!
Jack Crow.
Cerritos at 14th and Santa Fe.
Need immediate pickup.
None of them.
I'm alone.
Dead.
Sources report that
all the bodies were decapitated.
The heads were found buried
a mile from the murder scene.
The number of dead now stands at 19...
... with police still combing the motel.
Of course, we'll be standing by
to bring you any updates.
Forget it.
Buon giorno.
Come. Please sit down.
Who's this?
This is...
...Father Adam Guiteau.
Father Adam's in charge
of our archives.
A bookworm.
He's familiar with all
your activities.
So speak freely.
Tell me what happened.
We cleaned out the nest.
A master showed up.
No master was ever like this.
Superhuman strength. Unkillable.
We didn't stand a chance.
So tell me, cardinal...
...but couldn't he be the one?
The one we knew would
come along one day?
There are some other developments.
Sad developments.
Tom.
Our Tom. Our Tom Callahan.
He's dead.
And the whole European team
is wiped out.
When?
Three days ago.
Callahan was clearing
a nest near Cologne, Germany.
Local authorities reported it
as a terrorist act.
We found this at the site.
Is he the one?
Yes.
What is this?
A celebratum.
It's medieval Latin for "celebrate."
"Celebrate this."
Celebrate what?
We don't know.
I've authenticated it.
It was painted in 1340.
The subject's name is- was- Valek.
Jan Valek, born in Prague, 1311.
He was a priest...
...who turned against the Church
and led peasants...
...in an uprising,
capturing several towns.
Valek was captured.
He was tried for heresy
and burned at the stake.
But after his death
he was seen walking at night.
He killed the living
to drink their blood.
They opened his grave,
and it was found empty.
It's the first known case
of vampirism.
A priest.
Valek is not like the other masters
you've hunted. He is the first...
...and most powerful.
Of our slayers, you are
the only one who faced Valek...
...and survived.
I'm going back out.
You mind if I hang on to this?
I've been in contact with Rome.
The Vatican Council...
...requests that you rebuild
your team.
-There isn't time.
-You're to return to Monterey...
...recruit new team members...
...and try again when
you are at full strength.
Father Adam will accompany you
and take the place...
...of poor Father Giovanni.
I don't think so.
This is nonnegotiable.
Valek is the original.
The source of the disease.
The first vampire created
by the Church-
-By accident.
-Shut the fuck up!
This was your fight, cardinal.
Now it is mine.
If you refuse to obey the rules,
the operation will be canceled...
...the funding withdrawn.
You have any idea how
this Valek knows my name?
Stay close to him.
What's your name?
Do you understand
what's happened to you?
Help me!
Don't fuck with me, honey!
I'll snap your neck like a twig!
Now nod your head yes or no.
Do you understand
what's happened to you?
Do it!
All right.
Now I'm going to explain it to you.
First, I'm gonna take
my hand off your mouth.
You scream....
Good.
What's your name?
Katrina.
Okay, Katrina.
Here's the score.
I took off your clothes.
I cleaned you up.
I tied you down.
I also saved your ass.
You've been bitten by a vampire.
Remember the party at the motel?
Big guy, pointy teeth.
Really shitty breath.
Don't worry.
It'll come back to you.
A master vampire has a telepathic
link with his victims.
You're gonna help us find him.
While he's sleeping,
we unleash on him.
You're the bait, honey.
Sorry.
I know all about you, Mr. Crow.
I know your parents were
bitten by vampires.
You were raised by the Church
as it's master slayer.
The truth is, I didn't want
to be forced on you.
I was supposed to take over when
Father Giovanni retired.
I always dreamed of this.
Ever since I first heard
about you, the slayers.
I want to be part of the team,
just do whatever I could.
For example, if you
wanted to receive...
...the sacrament of confession-?
Fucking priest!
Who set us up?
Was it you? Who set us up?
Who was it?
Was it you? Who set us up?
I don't know what you mean!
You don't think I'll
kill you, a priest.
You're seriously misjudging me!
You want to kill me,
you go ahead!
I don't know what you're
talking about!
I don't.
We'll see about that.
Where are we going?
You have to tell me, Mr. Crow.
You ever seen a vampire?
First of all,
they're not romantic.
They're not a bunch of fags
in rented formalwear...
...seducing everybody with
Euro-trash accents.
Forget what you've seen
in the movies.
They don't turn into bats.
Crosses don't work.
Garlic? Stand there with garlic,
one of them will bend you over...
...and walk up your strata chocolata
while sucking your blood!
All right? And they don't sleep
in taffeta-lined coffins.
You wanna kill one? Drive a
wooden stake through his heart.
Sunlight turns them into
crispy critters.
Got it?
See this map?
This map shows all the encounters
in the U.S. as far back as the 1800s.
-I've never seen it.
-No one has.
Look at the Southwest.
See the spiral pattern?
Time-sequence the encounters, you get
a logarithmic pattern, ever-widening.
It's a search pattern, Padre.
They're looking for something.
Do you know what it is?
I heard stories
when I was young.
Something about a black cross.
About vampires walking
in the sunlight.
Padre.
Can I ask you something?
When I was kicking your ass...
...did that give you wood?
You get a little mahogany
from that ebony?
I'm just fucking with you.
Forget about it.
And what God has given her...
... is that she sees
her guardian angel.
Oh, Jesus!
What time is it?
You want one?
You gotta eat something.
I can't.
I wouldn't mind a cigarette.
We have to work on this.
The less you eat,
the faster the virus moves.
Virus?
That's what I call it.
Nobody knows what it really is.
Poison, Kool-Aid,
it all does the same thing.
Turns you into a vampire.
What happened to the other girls?
They didn't make it.
I'm sorry.
So you remember now?
Yeah, some.
-Why doesn't anyone know?
-Nobody wants to know.
That's how vampires survive.
They're smart.
They keep their numbers low,
and the world never catches on.
Will I be one?
I don't know for sure.
Probably.
Unless we find him before you turn.
Then, maybe there's a chance.
Here's what we do know.
You're connected to the master vampire.
He's a part of you.
And this link will grow.
You'll never get him out of you.
Not while he still exists.
Then I don't want to live.
You may not.
Can I get dressed now?
Sure.
Could you get me a towel
or something?
It's not like I haven't
seen you naked.
Fuck it!
Easy, easy.
I'll get you a towel.
One towel coming right up.
I won't peek.
Nice try. Leave the door open.
No way.
A little bit.
-Don't do it!
-Goddamn it, let me go!
Let me go!
Shit!
Stop it!
Look what you did!
You fucking bit me!
Are you fucking nuts?
Where are you going?
You bite me, huh?
Get up!
Fucking bite me!
Fucking bitch!
Fuck!
Goddamn it!
Fucking stupid whore.
Where are you?
I'm fine.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Room 312.
I'm coming up.
Stay put.
I'm Father Adam Guiteau.
You're Tony Montoya?
You look different.
I'm an archivist.
I've studied the team extensively.
What's this bruise on her jaw?
I had to hit her.
She tried to kill herself. I had to
pull her off the fire escape.
Then I fell through the window.
That's all?
Why'd you slug her?
I cut my arm on the broken glass.
I was pissed. I don't know.
I fucking slugged her.
Who cares?
That's our new Padre.
We've been ordered to Monterey.
Rebuild the team.
-We're going back to Monterey?
-No.
Callahan's whole team is gone.
Slaughtered.
So it's just us now.
That's right.
Who is she?
Some hooker.
Bitten by Valek.
These vampires are psychically linked.
As soon she hooks into Valek...
...we go look for him.
We have orders to follow.
Fuck you, Padre.
Language!
If you don't follow orders,
I'll have to call Cardinal Alba.
Excuse me.
Language.
We'll chat about language.
Shall we?
See if this syntax works.
You don't make a call,
don't blow your nose...
...don't wipe your ass,
unless I tell you. Okay?
Show me.
Katrina?
Can you hear me?
What is it?
There's someone else that you're
connected to in your mind, you know?
What're you seeing?
I can't.
Yes, you can, honey.
You're with us and safe.
