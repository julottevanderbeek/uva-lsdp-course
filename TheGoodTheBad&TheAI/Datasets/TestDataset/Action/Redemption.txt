Happy birthday,
Cristina.
Actually, it was
two days ago,
but thank you.
Happy birthday,
Cristina.
Actually, it was
two days ago,
but thank you.
No alcohol.
I'm looking for someone.
Joseph, where did you
get those clothes?
Her name's Isabel.
They saw her.
I've come
to save her.
Joseph, did you
rob someone?
I had some luck.
Maybe God, you know?
God gave me this.
Joseph, I'm going
to call David,
my police
liaison officer.
This is
for you, sister.
You're okay.
Buy something nice
for yourself.
Sister Cristina.
Mother Superior:
£500.
A donation
is a donation.
I don't see
the quandary.
Cristina:
They say he was
a commando.
He killed people
in Afghanistan.
That's what
soldiers do.
It doesn't mean
he's a thief.
He said,
"Maybe God."
Anyway, what do you think
the police themselves
would do with it
if you handed it in?
or at Christmas,
get them all jumpers
or something.
Actually, he told me
to buy something for myself.
I thought perhaps maybe
I could use
You see, there is something
I have been praying for.
If the money's
an answer to a prayer,
I've not
written anything down
about this in the book.
One for Maria
Zielinska.
One what?
One for the Maria Zielinska
farewell performance.
I'm afraid
it's all sold out.
Sold out?
But it isn't
until October.
It sold out online
in two hours.
Online.
We do still have
one box available.
A box?
On Tuesday,
October first.
And how much
is a box?
A box for
the farewell performance
is £500.

Man on radio:
-
Sister.
I'm afraid you're
too late for soup.
I'm not hungry.
I need medicine.
You're hurt?
I need antibiotics.
I'm not allowed
to dispense antibiotics.
But you do it for people
who can't get into the system.
-
Why not?
If you don't want
to give your name,
just call yourself
Smith or something.
That would be
a mistake.
- Why?
- My name  Smith.
Jones, then.
Sister...
I'm on the run
from a court-martial.
I was in
a Special Forces unit.
There'll be
no forgiveness.
How do you know
it's antibiotics you need?
I've got two broken ribs.
There's an infection
around one of the breaks.
If it spreads
to the bone, I'll die.
I've been
wounded before.
If you drink alcohol
with these, they won't work.
I'll need
painkillers.
Give me something
with dihydrocodeine.
Yes, sir.
I've asked around
about your friend Isabel.
How'd you know
about Isabel?
Last night,
don't you remember?
Did I come here
last night?
Do something stupid?
You said you'd
had some luck.
You don't believe?
So how do you explain
those new clothes?
I don't.
So what'd you find out
about Isabel?
She doesn't come
for food anymore.
If you see her,
give her this.
Tell her she
can come to me.
Tell her
she can be safe.
- Who lives here?
- Me.
- Did you break in?
- I fell.
Did you hurt someone?
Only myself.
Do you know the boys
say you're an angel?
Good night, Joseph.

Who are you?
Damon said he was gonna be

I'm Damon's boyfriend.
One of 'em.
Are you a model?
Sometimes.
Woman:
Do you have his number
in New York?
No, he keeps
himself very private.
Pity, you could've
called him.
Do you have a number?
He doesn't give it
to me.
In case I call him
late at night.
- I'm Tracy.

Joey Jones.
Damon said I should stay here
for the summer,
get my life
back together.
So that's what
I'm gonna do.
Whew.
Fuck.
Joey,
there's trouble.
Fucking dickhead's
trying to throw us out.
Is he fucking
following?
Dick, mate.
- Here we go.
- It's Soho, I wanna
see some tits.
It's late, boys.
You're gonna
miss your train.
Who are you,
our fuckin' mum?
He thinks he is.
Fuck me if he ain't.
- Tits, mate.
- Fucking there's
your tit.
- That's right, mate.
- Here's your fucking
tit, man.
Hey, don't fucking
touch my boy!
Fucking leave it,
mate.
He's a fucking soft,
southern fucking cunt.
- Easy, pal.
- Fucking get off him.
- You'll miss your train.
- I'll fucking have him!
Come on, then!
Man:
Now you've missed
your train.
Huh?
- You wanna work?
- Yeah.
You know what
kind of work I do.
They say you want
a driver.
I got a lot
of businesses.
They say you're
a hard man.
It's a hard city.
Child:
Can we play

Go on, then.

All right,
has it got fur?
Girl:
Woman:

Yeah.
- Is it a dog?
- No.
Right, so,
how many legs has it got?
- Two.
- You said four.
I hear he wants
to see me.
What the fuck?
New rules.
No room service cards
anywhere between
Lisle Street

What the fuck
are you talking about?
You're not even
a fucking Chink to be
giving out rules.
Show him.
New rules.

No.
Can I help you?
I've got a delivery
for the Angel of the
Lord's Mission.
There must be
a mistake.
It's paid for
by Joey Jones.
Okay, it's not
a mistake.
Who wants pizza?
-
-
Joey:
to have Mr. Choy's
envelope ready.
Also, I wanna order
takeaway for delivery.
It's very nice,
but I've no idea what it is.
I think
it's probably duck.
And there's fish
and chicken and pancakes.
- And this is from Crazy Joe
the angel, yeah?
- Next?
Just drive, man.
Just fucking drive.
That's his little sister.
She won't talk.
Dawn?
It's me.
Joe.
Nice suit.
Me and your daughter
live on £25 a week.
Since I lost my job,
I've been paying the landlord
with blowjobs.
What have you been doing
while they cut everything, Joey?
I've been fighting.
There's more
where this came from.
Lots more.
-
Joey:
Wasn't sure
you'd come.
Buying food for the boys,
it's okay,
but not this.
Giving me things puts me
in a very difficult position.
You're not vegetarian,
are ya?
Why are you lighting fires
on the pavement?
My Chinese boss
sends his people here
to buy meat
for his restaurants.
doing nothing.
So tonight I decided
to have a barbecue.
-
Tonight, I feed you.
This is a very strange
thing to be doing.
I miss the smell
of woodsmoke.
I'm guessing that you have
psychological problems.
They put me
up a mountain
and told me
to kill people.
What'd they think would
come back down the mountain?
Joseph, I came here
because I might
have some news...
about Isabel.
Last night,
my police liaison
officer
gave me
this photograph.
She was found
in the river.
They need help
with identification.
She was from the north,
that's all I know.
Did you love her?
We shared a box.
We'd just keep
each other warm.
Will you talk
to the police?
Fuck the police.
Joseph, I'm really sorry
to bring such awful news.
Where in the river?
The city, near
to Canary Wharf.
One of those
rich guys.
Yes, they think she
was killed by a client.
- The police give a shit?
- Of course they do.
David is a good man.
Really?
He's a "good man."
Good, good.
Good for him.
-
-
- In the fucking river!
If you dare to be angry
about Isabel...
for the Chinese boss.
They say, "Crazy Joey
deals drugs."
I just deliver the stuff.
I don't touch the stuff.
The autopsy said Isabel
"touched the stuff."
Maybe stuff
you delivered.
You don't put those things
together in your head.
You know why she
ended up in the river?
Because that's what
the river's for.
To wash away girls when
they're finished with them.
I see what's happening
in this fucking city.
You give them soup.
They want
their lives back!
Joey, when you were
out of your head on drugs
a few months ago,
you gave me some money.
I've spent it on
something for myself.
I haven't been able
to sleep properly since.
I-- I called
my sister in Warsaw.
She sold some of
the possessions
I left behind.
I don't need this.
I'm really sorry
about Isabel.
I know you
cared for her,
but think about
all the other Isabels.
Start to do
the right thing.
It is honest money.
I cleaned it for you.
Use it to start
an honest life.
I want you
to have this.
I'm gonna do a lot
of good things
this summer.
Give people
what they want.
I thought you might
want a dress.
Joey, I'm a nun.
I used to wear
a uniform.
Don't mean a thing,
you just take it off.
If it looks
beautiful on you,
then God would say
it's okay, wouldn't He?
I will put it in
the bag of clothes
for Africa.
Woman on TV:
Fuck.
Yeah!
Your cash
and your rocks, boys.
Don't remember me,
do you?
Not surprised.
I've changed.
You've got a knife...
I've got a spoon.
Who killed Isabel?
-
-
-
Go on, Joey.
Show 'em. Show 'em!
Who killed Isabel?
I don't know.
You're only alive
because I need information.
An eye for an eye.
You tell me
what happened to her,
or I'll kill you
with this spoon.
Some guy used to
rent her regular.
Beat her up.
He used to ask
for her.
He went too far.
Name.
We don't use names.
Describe him to me.
- Ah!
- Describe him to me.
He was about 30,
city boy,
scar over his eye.
That's all I know.
You get any trouble
from these two again,
you tell
Crazy Joe, okay?
Jesus.
Fuck.
You look--
Your note said
you had information
for the police
about Isabel's killer.
That is the only reason
I am here.
And I put on
this dress because
it is the only dress
I have.
And don't think I won't
send it to Africa,
because I will.
They think my name's Damon,
by the way.
Please don't remind me.
- I think I might faint.
- What?
I haven't eaten
anything all day...
worrying whether
or not I would come.
Also, I didn't realize
there would be
so many naked men.
Look, I arranged
to meet you here
because I thought
you might like the
photographs.
I didn't realize
there'd be photographs
of men's... penises.
Sorry.
Joey, actually,
I do like photographs.
I take photographs--
usually of nature.
Penises are nature,
I suppose.
Yes, I suppose they are.
So what'd
you tell the mother?
I lied, I lied,
I lied.
So what information
do you have?
Tell your policeman
to look for a guy
around 30.
He has a scar
above his eye.
Works in the city.
Should I
write this down?
That's all I have.
Okay...
scar above his eye,
works in the city.
Got it.
We haven't been
introduced.
I'm Karl.
What's your name?
Just looking around.
I'm told the invitation
you handed in at the desk
was addressed
to Damon Coldfield.
I happen to be Damon's
photographic agent.
He's in New York.
I think you're
a bit drunk.
Yes.
I'm having
a crazy patch.
Starting when
I bought the ticket.
What ticket?
I used your money to buy
a ticket to a ballet.
That's a pretty
wicked thing to do.
But, you see...
I've loved her
since I was a little girl.
Loved who?
Maria Zielinska.
She's 42
and still dancing.
She is who I always
wanted to be.
She is who
I should have been.
I'm in a silk dress
in an alleyway...
with a gangster.
- Whoa!
- Oop!
And I'm drunk.
Are you still
a gangster, Joey,
or did I change you?
Just having
a crazy patch, too.
There are things
that I have to do.
When the summer's over,
I'll stop.
Because of me, yes?
I have to think
I'm doing good.
Your excuse for wearing
a pretty dress.
When does Damon return?
October the first.
Then it's fate.
What is?
I should really say
it's God, but I don't.
You know why?
Because I'm not so sure
that God is there anymore.
That's the truth.
I think I'm going
to throw up.
Oh.
No, I'm fine.
Sister,
I'm Catholic.
I'm not your sister.
I'm drunk and I'm
up against the wall.
a scar
above the eye...
works in the city.
Woman:
Fleece half price,
T-shirts half price.
-
Joey...
H-how are things?
Things are okay.
Have you heard
from Damon?
Yeah, he's okay.
You seem
so together now.
I'm really
together now.
You're like
a different person.
So, Joey...
are you
exclusively gay?
You know,
it's interesting...
recently...
I've found myself
attracted to...
nuns.
Who the fuck are you?
You owe
Mr. Choy money.
What the fuck do you know
about Mr. Choy?
Joey:
What are you
talking about?
Mr. Choy only
employ Chinese.
Tell Mr. Choy
I'll send him a check.
I'm taking the cash.
Give me
the fucking cash.
Step out of the way,
my friend,
and let me take
some of what you owe in cash
as a gesture
of goodwill.
No!
Woman:
-
That money belongs
to my family.
Man:

Man on radio:
Woman on radio:
Is there a problem?
You are scaring my clients.
We're looking
for someone.
We've been told
he used to come down here.
Let me help ya.
What are you
doing here?
I just lied
to the police.
You haven't
changed at all.
If I could
do something else,
I would do it.
What did
the policeman say
when you gave him
the description?
He laughed at me.
He said it was
"too vague."
He said, "Tell
Joey Jones to come
and speak
to us himself."
You mean they
can't be bothered
to fucking look
'cause she was
a whore.
The truth is...
the police
are more interested
in finding out
more about
You're becoming
famous, Joey.
You really are
a hypocrite.
You beat Taxman so bad
he's still in hospital.
You're not
just an angel,
you're God Almighty
dispensing justice.
Sometimes you have to
make it happen yourself.
I'm not the only
hypocrite here.
Want a kiss?
- Sorry.
- Get out of my car.
It's a van.
I suppose you think
it was very funny
that I got drunk.
I've been drunk myself
on occasion.
What exactly happened?
You don't remember?
It's all a blur.
You asked me to kiss you,
so I kissed you.
You didn't have
to kiss me
just because
I asked.
I wanted to.
Why did you want to?
That's a really
stupid question.
Look in the mirror.
It's not my fault
that I'm fucked up.
For a nun, your language
is pretty bad.
So whose fault is it?
He was my
gymnastics instructor.
It was in Warsaw.
It was my father
who made me do
gymnastics.
I wanted to be
a ballerina,
but he said no.
Cristina:
My instructor
began to...
He began to do it
when I was 10 years old.
He did it 17 times.
For a very long time,
I believed I belonged in hell.
Because I was
so young...
they decided not
to send me to prison.
Instead, they sent me
to a convent.
Joey, I...
I have never told this
to anyone before.
Want me to drive?
I want someone
to drive.
Cristina:
How will you
get home?
I'm a gangster.
I'll steal a car.
I'll walk.
It's a lovely
morning.
Cristina,
in the end,
I just took off
my uniform and ran.
And look
what happened to you.
Sister Cristina,
I am deeply shocked.
You filled in
the Africa application.
My preference is
for the Valley Mission
in Sierra Leone.
But what about
your work here
at the Soho Mission?
Africa was always
part of my life plan.
Yes, in two years.
I want permission
to move it forward.
I am finding there are
too many distractions
here in London.
You're blushing.
It's very warm
in here.
It's even warmer
in Sierra Leone.
Hot, even.
I will wear a hat.
You have applied
to leave in this quarter.
I am ready to leave any time
after October the first.
Joey, they said you wanted
to speak to the boss.
Come with me.
Sit.
Madame, you know
everything that happens
in your back garden.
If a man pays for girls
and he's violent,
he soon becomes famous.
We refuse to deal
with them.
I understand you have
a blacklist of violent men.
Joey:
who attacks girls.
He's young.
Around 30.
And he has a scar
above his eye.
He wears
very expensive suits.
We know him.
The description
is not too vague for you?
We have a business
to protect.
Madame,
would you be able to
find out the name
of this man?
Hmm.
A favor for a favor.
- Did they tell you?
- Tell me what?
They didn't
tell you.
No, no, stop!
- Ah!
- They didn't
tell you.
Stop.
Some of them
are kids.
And some of them
are girls.
You want one?
I also asked
for information.
It's coming, okay?
It's the latest.
Do you know how to work it?
Yes, of course.
You could afford to get
a professional to do this.
Yeah, but I wanted you.
So who are
the photographs for?
My daughter.
You have a daughter?
Nine years old.
I came here with her once
when she was small.
I want her to have
some photographs of me
looking like
a normal man.
What do you think?
Like this?
Smile.
Why?
Okay, actually,
you look okay.
Do I look like
a good man?
What do you mean?
I want her to think
I'm a good man.
Yes, you look like
a good man.
So take a picture.
Did your daughter
ask for photos?
I want her to have something
to remind her of me.
You won't see her?
I don't think I'll look
like this for much longer.
Why not?
Why shouldn't you
stay like this?
Just take a picture.
You should have
one like this.
More natural.
The businessman drinking
his morning coffee.
Such a successful man.
So rich.
- Charitable.
-
She will be
very proud of you.
Enough.
I said enough.
At last a laugh.
There.
I am changing you.
Send those ones to me.
I'll take them with me
to Africa.
You're going to Africa?
A valley in Sierra Leone
where there is no water.
When do you leave?
Tomorrow.
So this is the end
of my crazy patch, Joey.
And I've decided
I want to end it with you.
Vendor:
half price.
T-shirts half price.
Keep the change.
...half price.
A massive 50...
Hello?
Who's there?
-
Joey:
Who the bloody
hell are you?
I don't know who you are,
but open this door.
-
Cristina.
There's enough money in here
to get us away.
We could go anywhere
in the world.
No, Joey...
if you want to be
a good man,
be a good man.
Joey, will you come with me
to the ballet tonight?
I have a box.
There is room for two.
Tonight at 7:00.
Cristina:
Our mission has had
some failures.
Some tragedies...
the poor girl Isabel.
But we have also
had successes.
And we have also
had some who,
Who are you?
I've got something
for your mother.
And something
for you.
Can I just hold your hand
for a minute?
Dawn:
You be good, okay?
Announcer:

Absolutely, no.

How was your bonus

It was very good.
Are you from Cisco
or American Eagle?
No. I'm from down there.
Listen, can I talk to you
for a minute?
I was actually
just getting some drinks.
- Who are you?
- Who am I?
Let me think...
-
What the--
what the hell do you want?
I think you should know
how it feels to be down there.
What?

I hurt people.
I drink to weaken

Hummingbirds.
Hummingbirds were there
