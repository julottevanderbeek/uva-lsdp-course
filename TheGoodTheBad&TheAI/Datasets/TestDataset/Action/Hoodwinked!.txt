SHARKS
There must be some mistake. No one
has mentioned collegial indifferences.
Ask anyone.
I'm the best salesman.
You're good, Laura.
But I have to fire you.
- Why?
- I'm sure you know why.
No.
A lot of money has disappeared
from the expense account.
- What does that have to do with me?
- You had access.
- Sune, I'm not a thief.
- You and I have sole access, Laura.
I won't listen. And I won't work here
if people don't trust me. I resign.
- Be glad we don't report you.
- I have three months' notice.
I have to ask you.
Is this because I won't fuck you?
- No.
- I bloody well thought so.
- No, for Christ's sake.
- You're a creep. Bloody disgusting.
Yuck!
on the old lady crossing first.
- What?
- The old lady before the kid.
turns green. It's the final heat.
Mrs. Zimmerframe is out in front,
followed closely by the homeboy.
Funky homeboy is trying to pass.
Yes! Mrs. Zimmerframe is an old pro.
- I just won 500. Good for me.
- Watch where you're going!
I can teach a beginners' class.
I can float like a butterfly!
Have you ever seen a butterfly? It
flies like it drank a bottle of vodka.
Now what?
- You owe us money, Willy.
- You can't just come barging in.
- I'm doing business.
- Fine. Here's a business tip.
The next time you need money,
don't go to Holger, go to the bank.
They may ask dumb questions, but
afterwards you can fuck them over.
- I'm not fucking anyone over.
- They just send you a letter.
- But Holger sends us.
- Things haven't...
- You said I couldn't box.
- I was talking to him.
- I gave him a right cross.
- You did not. It wasn't a right cross.
You used your left.
So it wasn't a right cross.
- No teaching for you.
- Beginners don't learn a right cross.
- They just jump rope, man.
- Fine!
Skalle?
Skalle, for Christ's sake.
- Skalle!
- Okay. Enough, Willy.
You've got till tomorrow.
Come on, Kaje.
You're fucking crazy, man!
He was strangling me!
It's no use floating like a butterfly
if you can't sting like a bee.
- But I do.
- No, you don't.
Has someone taken my owl?
Christ, Laura. You can't
bet on the dogs with a stuffed owl.
- It's worth a lot of money.
- So your winnings will be 500 owls?
Lend me a thousand.
I'm feeling lucky.
Nope. Your account is closed.
Look. Here's a check in American
dollars that's worth 15,000. Take it.
- No wa y.
- Then I'll cash it in the bank.
Regards to your consultant.
- What the hell are you up to?
- I just won 15,000.
That's my machine. I put a lot of into
it, so technically that's my money.
- Not yours.
- What?
- It's my machine.
- Harry, who owns this machine?
Leave me out of this.
Laura, remember your eagle.
You don't pla y
on other people's machines.
I'll remember that.
Chocolate milk all round. 15,000!
You can't do that! You cheated me,
you fucking dumb-ass machine!
Take that!
- Move!
- What the hell's going on?
- So is Holger upstairs?
- Why?
- What?
- Why?
Tonny, shut up.
Is he upstairs?
Watch your language.
I was polite to you.
- Is he up there?
- Why? Go on up, Claus.
I'm thinking of signing that band.
What do you think?
I know nothing about music.
People in the business aren't
the only ones that can spot a hit.
It's really up to the audience.
So what do you think?
- It's good.
- Oka y, boys!
Shut up for a minute.
- From the restaurant guy?
- Yes. That's all he had.
Yes.
I'd hate to be paid a visit from you.
I was thinking that
I should pay what I owe you.
Oh, you've got money for me.
How much did that boxing place cost?
- 225,000.
- 225,000.
I borrowed 100,000 from you,
and I've paid it.
Give me 30 grand in interest,
and that's the end of it. Alright?
If you get the restaurant guy
and the gambler to pa y -
- I'll only take 20% of your take.
- 20%? Forever?
- It's a bloody good deal.
Play!
By the way, I disagree.
That song is crap.
- Your deal with Holger is cool.
- It's shitty.
As long as I owe Holger,
this place will never be mine.
- Welcome to Claus' Gym.
- Is that the name?
It's stupid.
It's that S. Clauses Gym.
- It's with an apostrophe.
- Why not call it Skalle's Gym?
- Because my name is Claus.
- It's stupid. It doesn't sound cool.
- What would you suggest?
- Kaje and Skalle's Gym.
- You can't even box.
- Can too!
- Can too!
- Cannot.
No, I'm doing this on my own.
Knock it off, man.
- How much are we collecting?
- No idea. Look in the book.
Christ!
Go around, you fat fuck!
- Let me just park this heap.
- Don't bother.
Idiot!
- Andersen...
- Just go in. The door's open.
See.
God! I'm so sorry.
Are you oka y?
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine.
- Can I help you?
- I said I'm fine.
- Is it Soren?
- My name is Claus.
Yes, but is it Soren
you're looking for?
- I think so.
- Okay. He's not home.
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Of course I am.
- Can I give him a message?
- Yes. Tell him he owes us money.
- Soren?
- Need help?
No, I'm just toasting the bread.
Yes! The French bread came first!
I won. You owe me 400.
- That's nice, dear.
- Yes. You owe me 400.
- Let's eat.
- I'll be right there.
in the third slot pops up first. Now!
- Are you coming soon?
- In a minute. I'm really behind.
Okay, I'm bushed anyway.
You go ahead and finish
whatever you're doing.
Good morning.
Hi!
What are you doing?
- Why aren't you at work?
- I had a cancellation.
- So when are you off?
- In a minute. Unfortunately.
- What are you watching?
- You scared me!
- What is that?
- I'm looking for a weather forecast.
I have to check the weather
for work. Can you find it?
- No. Aren't you going to work?
- Not till later.
It's like that
almost every da y now.
- Is there something wrong?
- No.
I just can't find that damn forecast.
It's irritating.
Thanks.
What?
- I just want you to be happy.
- I am.
Good.
I'm off.
- Do you want a cheese kiss?
- Yes. Bye.
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
- Should I thrash that gambler woman?
- Woman? No, I'll do it.
Sa y that bit about the bank.
It sounds cool.
You owe us money.
Hey! You owe us money!
The next time you refuse
to pay back a loan, go to the bank.
If you miss a pa yment,
they send you a nice little letter.
Are you finished now?
Why don't you break this?
Or how about this?
More? Come here.
What about all this?
Here's some more.
There we go. There's still plenty.
What do we have here?
A DVD player.
Where are you going? Take a look!
- Did you get the money?
- Let's go.
- What happened? Did you get it?
- She's crazy. Just go.
- Drive. She's a nutcase.
- Fuck her. Let's rob an armored car.
Are you mentally prepared to defend
your title as world champion?
Can you read what this sa ys?
Champion of the world. That's me.
- How have you prepared mentally?
- I've studied his moves on video.
Claus, do you have a minute?
I hear you don't like
the work I give you.
- Are you wasting your time?
- A little.
You should be fucking glad
you're allowed to work here.
You're only here to show the others
what happens to slackers.
- I've been sober for two years.
- That could have been you.
- What do you think of Omar?
- He has a good technique.
He's an idiot. No self-discipline.
No respect for anything.
His American trainer went home.
- He's overrated if you ask me.
- Why?
He hasn't had a strong opponent
since he won the title. He's sloppy.
His punches are too predictable.
So I guess
you wouldn't be his trainer.
Are you asking me
to be the champion's trainer?
Yeah, but since he's overrated,
you'd rather sweep the floors.
He's has a good technique.
- Hey! Wait a minute...
- Oka y. That'll do.
- Two more days.
- Too late. Stick your finger out.
- Stop it, Kaje.
- I don't give a fuck.
I said stop it. You owe Holger
money. When will he get it?
Thanks.
Holger?
- You know I'm going to be a trainer?
- Has your gym already opened?
No, not yet. I've been offered
to be Omar Halim's trainer.
- The world champion.
- Awesome. Congratulations.
It's legit,
so I can't keep this job.
- You make me sound like a gangster.
- I didn't mean to.
Haven't I always helped you
with money when you were broke?
- Been patient about the payments?
- Yes, but...
I'd like to keep the two separate,
since it's my boxing club.
Then pa y what you owe me. Play!
Can I have a pa yment plan?
- You don't want that.
- I do.
- No.
- Yes.
Remember that client
you visited last week?
- With the bad habit?
- Yes.
He has a pa yment plan.
He owes less than you.
Didn't he end up in the hospital?
I'd hate to be paid a visit by you.
- I'll get you the money.
- No.
I'll rob a gas station.
They're loaded.
- They don't even take 1000 notes.
- They do.
- A 7- 11?
- Shut up.
Ramming a car in a storefront?
We've had a burglary.
They stole all my CD's and watches.
- They were worth a fortune.
- Flip the switch.
The damage is worth a fortune.
...I'm Omar Halim.
You have a worthy opponent,
so there is a risk.
It doesn't mattter
with Diamond Jackson.
Stop.
You have to mix it up.
Otherwise you're
too predictable. Try to block.
- Knock it off.
- Block!
- Block.
- My blocks are fine.
My biggest problem is
the two weeks before a match -
- when I can't have any pussy.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Why weren't you blocking?
- Fucking idiot!
- Chill. Why didn't you block?
- Your aim really sucks.
- What are you doing here?
- Hello there! I'm Omar.
- How unexpected to find you here.
Where people beat each other up.
- Nice place. Is this your office?
- What do you want?
A Cartier and an Omega watch.
They're worth over 80,000 each.
It's called style.
Something you know nothing about.
I still owe you 70,000.
You'll get it in two weeks.
In the meantime you leave me
and my boyfriend alone. Deal?
- If you're doing me over...
- Would I come down here then?
You must be crazy.
- No wa y a watch is worth 80,000.
- It's called style, you loser.
- She's fucking you over.
- No, I can handle it.
- You never could with the ladies.
- I can.
All you ever talk about is boxing,
and the bitches couldn't care less.
- Talk about their interests.
- Like what?
Astrology. Let's sa y you find
a chick you want to fuck.
And she says she's an Aquarius.
You go, "Do you feel like one?"
And off she goes.
"I'm so sensitive and impulsive..."
- What do I care if she's an Aquarius?
- You don't, man.
The important thing is to get
her to reveal intimate secrets.
That saves you three pints
and small talk. Works like a charm.
- Can I come over for a cup of tea?
- Yes. You're alwa ys welcome, dear.
- Fine. I'll see you in 20 minutes.
- Great. Bye.
- When is she coming?
- In 20 minutes.
I'll get the stereo in the kitchen.
Take the napkin rings in the drawer.
Don't forget the cell phone.
Are you fucking crazy?
Not you. Keep pla ying.
Are you crazy?
- They're worth 80,000 each.
- A couple of watches?
- They're very classy.
- What the hell do you know? Claus.
- Can you get the money or not?
- Of course I can.
Thank you!
- How are you, Laura?
- Hi, postman Pat. Better than ever.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.
- Have you come to borrow money?
- Not at all.
- Sure?
- Can't I come by for a cup of tea?
- I suppose so. Come in.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Laura. Long time no see.
- Do you have any?
I promise to pay you back.
We're really broke.
Soren has trouble at work, and the
kitchen costs more than we thought.
- You must come and see it soon.
- Yes, we must. We must.
- 5000. That's all we can afford.
- That's terrific. Thanks, Mom.
You haven't started
betting again, have you?
No.
I really... no.
Why do you ask?
No, it's because of the kitchen.
You know? That damn kitchen
just won't get finished.
- What's the matter, honey?
- Damn workmen.
ARCADE
CASH PAYMENT
- Now what?
- The watches weren't any good.
- I want cash.
- You'll have to wait.
We've been robbed, but
we'll get money from the insurance.
When?
- Maybe in a month.
- I can't wait that long.
Too bad.
You can have the mail bag. It's leather.
There might be checks inside.
- I don't want some damn mail bag.
- Then take this.
- 5000.
- Thanks, but it's not enough.
- It's all I have.
- There aren't any checks inside.
- And it's not leather.
- No.
How much do you need to leave
me alone? We'll make a deal.
You'd better wait here.
Because I said so.
- Hi, Laura.
- Hi, Sille. You look great!
- Hi, Laura!
- How nice to see you.
- Were you in France?
- Yes. Sune, do you have a minute?
- Not really.
- Just two seconds.
- Who is that guy?
- Nobody. Just a quick word.
- You really think we owe you pa y?
- Yes, I had three months' notice.
It's not normal to spend 100,000
at a casino. Forget it, Laura.
- You milked your expense account.
- But we got the client.
- It's normal to treat new clients.
- At a casino?
- That was after the client left.
- Yes, but...
Thug methods don't work on me.
Not at all.
Oka y, you win.
Just get him out of here.
And then you leave.
- 40,000. But not a penny more.
- They have cash in the reception.
- What sign are you?
- Gemini.
- Do you feel like one?
- Christ, I don't know.
I don't believe in astrology.
Okay.
- It's no good.
- What?
Astrology's no good.
Soren and I are the same sign -
- and we're completely different.
I'm very romantic.
He thinks he is too, but since when
it is romantic to get a DVD pla yer -
- and the complete works
of Kieslowski? I'm very spontaneous.
But he wouldn't fart without
getting the council's permission first.
- Who's Soren?
- Would he save me from drowning?
I'd probably drown because he'd fold
his clothes neatly before jumping in.
- Don't you know how to swim?
- Excuse me?
- I'm only violent if people don't pay.
- And otherwise they get beaten.
- I never hit people. I threaten them.
- And you're good at that.
Threatening with violence
is the same as physical violence.
No, it isn't. It's like a lawyer
threatening with distraint.
- So you're like a lawyer.
- Yes. No.
- People shouldn't borrow money.
- Listen... This guy can be difficult.
- In what wa y?
- He denies owing me money.
- Really?
- He might be tough to convince.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- You owe us money.
- No.
- Laura Andersen. 15,000.
- No.
- You owe me 15,000.
- Laura, we talked about this. I don't.
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Pay what you owe now.
- I can't be bothered with you now.
- Okay.
- Go away! I'm not giving you any.
- It's no use. Give it up.
- I refuse to give you any.
- Open the door, or I'll have to...
- Here.
- Thanks.
- 15,000.
- How the hell did you do that?
- I have a place I want you to see.
- Alright!
- What is this place?
- It's mine.
- Do you live here?
- Yes. Not here, upstairs.
- It's a great room, isn't it?
- Yes. It's lovely... a bit run down.
- Yes, it's a perfect room.
- What's it for?
- I see. You're going to train boxers.
- I already do.
When you build it yourself, you know
the quality is good. This is mine.
But you can't be a boxing trainer
without... are they called clients?
- Students.
- People want to learn to box.
I want to be a good trainer.
I want to do something decent.
People can learn to give
a decent punch and not...
No.
- It sounds stupid.
- Not at all.
You want to do something decent
and for other people. That's good.
Yes.
- That's great.
- Yes.
- Do a series.
- What?
Punch a series.
Put them up.
Cover your whole body.
Arms together, so I can't hit
your body. Otherwise...
Put them up. Hit me.
- Do you want me to hit you?
- It's oka y. Come on. Hit harder.
Corner me.
Back me into the corner.
Hit as hard as you can.
Upper cut or one to the liver.
Under my block.
Psych me out. Come on!
That's not psyching me out.
Psych me out.
That's it. Do it!
And now I grab you and hold on.
I got it!
Psych you out and blam!
Psych you out and then an uppercut.
Yes. If you put the tap back,
I'll hook it up later.
What?
Don't you snore a lot
with a broken nose?
How can you breathe through it?
Does your girlfriend get any sleep?
- How did you break it?
- At 17 I was a cowboy in Oklahoma.
A heifer took off and was
heading for a bus full of little kids -
- and I had to throw myself at it,
and it kicked me in face.
- But I got it.
- Holy shit! Were you a cowboy?
- Yes. Hell no.
- Then how did you break it?
The district championship in 89,
Arizona in 90 and the regional in 93.
- So you broke it three times?
- No, nine.
I think it looks cool.
It suits a thug who collects money.
That was a joke. Sorry.
- I think it looks cool.
- Don't you live around the corner?
Yes.
- Do you think I'm a pain in the ass?
- No.
I've alwa ys been told that.
Am I irritating? A little?
- No.
- You can tell me.
- You're not irritating at all.
- Yes.
- Just a little? Once in a while?
- A little.
Hell no. You're not.
I would tell you if you were.
- Not at all. I don't think so.
- I had a good time today. It was fun.
It was great.
What?
Did you want to say something?
Take care.
Your broken nose suits you.
You look good.
- Laura.
- Hi, Mom. What are you doing here?
You poor thing.
- What have you been doing?
- Did you call my mom and dad?
- What is this, Laura?
- Did you call my mom and dad?
Do you realize
how much money you owe?
- What's going on, dear?
- Nothing. Move, please.
- It's an awful lot of money this time.
- Laura, what the hell are you doing?
- Laura...
- We need to figure this out.
- Not now.
- You have over 36 accounts.
You owe more than 456,000. You
even opened an account in Sweden.
I can't take your female tantrums.
I'm here to help you. Help me.
- What's gotten into you?
- Why do you need a bank in Sweden?
- Why won't you let me help you?
- You're always at the damn PC.
- You haven't got a new kitchen.
- When did we sleep together?
- Yesterday.
- No, we didn't.
Do you know what yesterda y was?
It was our third anniversary. Idiot.
I'm sorry. I apologize.
No, it wasn't. Our third
anniversary isn't for months.
Laura!
Why won't you let me help you?
Laura. Fuck!
Go on home. If she comes back,
I'll call you. She has nowhere to go.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm sorry...
- No, come in.
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come.
- It's okay.
But I don't have
anywhere else to go.
I fucked everything up.
And no one can stand me.
- I can't even stand myself.
- There, there.
It'll be okay.
I'm sorry. That's not what I wanted.
That wasn't meant to happen.
- Sorry.
- It was my mistake.
I'm glad you came here.
Come here. It'll be oka y.
While you're here with me,
nothing can happen to you.
- I'll take care of you. Are you oka y?
- Yes.
Let me see.
Okay.
Come on in.
I'll close the door.
- Do you want to wipe your nose?
- Can I use this?
Is that you? Wow!
- Yes.
- Don't you box anymore?
I'm not allowed to. I was alwa ys
dead drunk. I can't remember a thing.
- But now you're a trainer.
- Only because I'm on Antabuse.
Otherwise they won't let me. No...
It's best to have your own place.
So you're on Antabuse now?
After just one drop of alcohol,
I'm sick like a dog and want to die.
- I'd like a pill like that.
- Do you drink?
- No.
- You can have one.
I wish there were a pill against me.
All I do is ruin other people's lives.
- No...
- I don't have any money or a job.
I don't have a family or a boyfriend
anymore. I'm my own worst enemy.
About toda y, you know?
I had a really good day.
When you said
I'd given you a good day...
I don't think I've done that
for anyone else before.
Not ever. I mean...
So how does it feel?
Good.
Really good.
What's wrong with you, Claus?
I try to help you, and what do you do?
- You ruin my business.
- No, I don't.
I help people who can't get help.
I only have one rule.
Stick to the agreement or else. Break
that rule, you ruin my business.
- I've honored our agreement.
- Good, Claus.
The money from
that girl is in the drawer.
That's good, son.
- Is it a joke?
- What do you mean?
- 20 kroner.
- The rest is in the top drawer.
There's more here. 25 kroner.
- Shit. She took my money.
- Now what?
- I'll get it back.
- No. She is being taken care of.
Halim, the boxer you're training,
stands to win tomorrow, right?
We can make a killing if he loses.
Make sure he does, Claus.
- I can't do that.
- Yes, because then we're quits.
Then you can get your own
boxing place going. That's nice, son.
Christ...
- That's the last game.
- Can you lend me 5000?
- We're closing now.
- You're a bunch of pussies.
- I'm done.
- You're kidding!
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, Laura.
- Move, jerk.
Move. Let me go!
Damn!
Laura?
You have a gambling debt.
What are you doing to pa y it?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
- You've already been paid.
- You mean the watches?
- They're not worth a damn.
- They're worth over 80,000 each.
- Claus says you have over 50,000.
- It's in the safe at the Arcade.
In the safe? All of it?
- You let her use Holger's money?
- I wasn't working last night.
How can you do that to Skalle?
He's crazy about you.
There we go.
I gor is a plumber.
I think he's got the water running.
It's only the hot water,
but that's the most important.
Boxers want a hot shower.
That's disgusting.
Hot, isn't it?
- What's so funny?
- I've heard about your tactics.
You look dangerous,
but you don't do anything.
- Did Skalle tell you that?
- Yes. He sa ys...
- What the hell are you doing?
- Sorry.
You know what? Skalle is lying.
Men do that to get laid.
- Hey! Have you seen Laura?
- I'm only using this machine.
- Only this one.
- Have you seen Laura or not?
- I'm not pla ying on any of the others.
- Where is Laura?
Shut the fuck up!
Where is she?
- Where is she?
- You mean that Laura?
- Where is she?
- Fuck if I know. I gor took her.
I gor?
- Tell Holger that I helped you.
- You bet.
- Won't she get burnt?
- No, it's only 130 degrees.
- Can you get me collection work?
- Tomorrow night.
- I have to work.
- You're sure it won't burn her?
- No.
- Fuck! How will you get the money?
You're getting burnt.
You bitch, you're ruining everything.
- It doesn't work.
- You're ruining your life.
And Skalle's and my boxing club.
Can't you do anything right?
Hi, Skalle.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Getting your money.
- Otherwise Holger gets this place.
- You still don't get it.
The idea with this place is to get rid
of Holger. I don't care about him.
But Holger does.
Shit!
- Could we stop for a minute?
- I'm late.
- It hurts really bad.
- It'll be worse tomorrow.
- That makes me feel much better.
- Where's the money?
It was a card game. I don't know what
it's called, but you can win a lot.
You lost 60,000 in a game
whose the name you don't know.
- Do you know what you've done?
- I was going to give it all to you.
I didn't know it would go wrong.
It felt like a lucky da y.
There's no such thing
as lucky da ys or unlucky days.
There are only... days.
- Sorry. I'll get the money back.
- Get awa y from me.
- I promise to get it back.
- You can't.
- You want to bet?
- No.
- Sorry I'm late.
- Sa y hello to Sergei Sak...
- Zakharov. Sergei Zakharov.
- Hello.
- He's from Russia.
- Kazakhstan.
He lives in California.
He's very good.
He won Olympic gold in 84 and 88.
He's Omar's new trainer.
- What?
- Get real. Omar is the world champ.
He deserves the best.
Thanks for the clothes.
They fit perfectly.
Listen. I'm so sorry about the money.
So what do we do now?
There's nothing we can do.
Unless he takes a dive tomorrow.
- If he loses, we can make a killing.
- Knock him over and break his arm.
- But then he can't box.
- We can get him roaring drunk.
You can't get him drunk
the day before a fight.
- Yes, I can. Do you want to bet?
- It can't be done.
- Aren't you...?
- Marketing coordinator at Suzuki.
- Nice duds.
- Thanks, it's part of a bet.
I think we can get you a sponsor
deal if you're still interested.
- My buddy!
- Buddy? Didn't I just get fired?
- You're going to be in my corner.
- What about Sergei?
There's room for both of you.
What's this about Toyota?
No, Suzuki Motors.
Since this is a last-minute deal, it's
a bit rough round the edges, okay?
We expect you to wear our logo
whenever the press is present.
- What does Omar get?
- A free car and 1.2 million per year.
Okay.
If you get our logo tattooed on your
shoulder, we're talking big bucks.
How about a beer?
- Do you have any coins?
- Are you going to give him a tattoo?
No. It's tactical. Let him refuse this,
so he'll agree to something else later.
Isn't 1.2 million a little rash?
Thomas Bjorn gets twice that
from Ecco Shoes.
Who the hell is Thomas Bjorn?
The contracts will be here in a week,
but if we drink to it, it's binding.
- No beer for me.
- Don't we have a deal?
- The fight's not till tomorrow.
- I haven't eaten all da y.
You can drink this.
It's a light beer.
- You're in great shape, so...
- Just one then.
Cheers!
Okay. How much
will you pa y for the tattoo?
- There we go. Take a look.
- My goodness!
- It's gorgeous. Now we have a deal.
- Do you like it?
- It's beautiful.
- When do I get the check?
It's on its way from Japan, but
first they have to confirm our deal.
- Confirm it?
- In Japanese.
- We drink to it, and it's binding.
- We already did that.
It has to be sake,
or it's no good.
- None for me.
- It's like sherry. You can take it.
- Can't we draw up a contract?
- This is just like drinking tequila.
- What's that green stuff?
- Dip. Glass in the other hand.
You drink the sake first,
then you eat the green thing.
- Cheers!
- Cheers.
Water!
Yuck, the water tastes...
- How's it going?
- Fine.
- What the hell?
- He's fine. I won the bet, right?
- He's wasted.
- Ta xi!
- What did you give him?
- Sake.
- Has he been drinking?
- No. I gave him Antabuse.
I gave him a pill after he drank
booze. You said that makes you sick.
- So now he can't win.
- Where did you get the pill?
- From your pocket.
- Has he been drinking or not?
- No!
- Yes!
The pills in my pocket are morphine.
Boxers get one
when they've broken their jaw.
- He didn't get a whole one, did he?
- No.
- I need to know if I can trust you.
- Of course you can.
- Bet 70,000 on Omar losing.
- Do you have 70,000?
No, but I know someone who does.
I can get it tomorrow.
But I'm at the match, so can you
get it and bet it on Omar losing?
No problem.
Will you come and give it to me
and not spend it on gambling?
- Can you do that?
- Yes, I can.
- He doesn't look good. Is he sick?
- No! I told you...
What's going on?
Idiots, turn on the lights!
- Well done.
- Can't a person have a smoke?
I don't think you should
sit there and smoke, Kaje.
- You're sitting near 24 kilos of C-4.
- Where did it come from?
A guy in the armed forces
owed Holger 20 grand.
Plastic explosives aren't
dangerous without detonators.
- My uncle...
- Tonny! Get over here!
It's useless without detonators.
- That's true.
- Tonny, what's going on?
There are 1,500 MPA detonators
in the box under you.
- Get in here!
- You want some coffee?
Please.
That'll do.
Don't touch me. If you do,
you'll experience unimaginable pain.
Omar will lose tomorrow.
I'm not sure in which round.
- That's my boy.
- I guarantee he'll be in bad...
Bad shape.
- I can't box.
- Of course you can.
- I'm sick.
- No, you're not.
Feel good, champ?
I'm going to be sick.
I want to talk to Willy.
Claus sent me.
Here you go.
Tell Claus that we're even now.
We're ready for the IBO
World Championship in 12 rounds.
The referee is Soren Sauballe.
Tonny sa ys you got the money from
Willy, but Holger hasn't received it.
Tonny sa ys you're fucking Holger
over. Have you lost your mind?
- Tonny is a jerk.
- Do you have Willy's money?
Of course.
I'll get it to Holger.
- What's the matter? Are you sick?
- I feel like shit.
- Do you want to cancel?
- Don't tell them you were partying.
- That'll be the end of your career.
- I wasn't partying.
Exactly.
Get in the ring. He's fine.
- He's fine. He's just nervous.
- You're in deep shit.
- They'll take Kaje and Skalle's Gym.
- Who is this person?
- Now I'll have to get the money.
- Kaje, I have to ask you to leave.
Just keep your fancy job
and your new Dutch friend.
- Leave the dirty work to me as usual.
- He's Russian and not my friend.
Get your friend
out of here right now.
Crybaby, crybaby, crybaby...
Omar Halim!
- 75,000 on Jackson in that match.
- 75,000? You can't.
- I can spend my money as I like.
- It's too late. They're in the ring.
- No! No! No!
- Too late.
No holding, go back after break.
Good luck to both of you.
- Harry, can I bet on the dogs?
- Sure. You can bet on all of it.
Box!
Get him.
I just gave you 75,000,
and you won't lend me a lousy 500?
Fuck!
I'm no expert, but that boxing
match was pretty bad, wasn't it?
Your childish pranks have cost me
a fortune. Where's the money?
- I don't have any.
- Willy sa ys he gave you a lot.
- Willy doesn't know shit.
- I think he does.
It wasn't him.
It was a lady, but he sent her.
- And where might she be?
- I don't know.
Yes.
Yes.
- Claus, where is she?
- Tell him, for Christ's sake.
- We'll find her anyway.
- I don't know!
- Break his finger.
- It's going to break, Claus.
This is unnecessary.
- The fuck you doing?
- He won't fess up.
- He was just about to.
- Sorry.
Now he's messed up.
Hold it, for fuck's sake.
That's enough. Sit down, Claus.
Tonny. What's going on?
Have you all lost your minds?
For the last time,
where is the girl?
- Drop the bag.
- No, Tonny.
- How much is there?
- 280,000.
Now we're even.
- Claus. We did it. Thanks.
- No problem.
Claus, we have to talk.
I have plenty of work for you.
Great.
Laura! Laura!
Laura! Laura!
- Hi.
- Are you moving?
To my parents'
till I get myself together.
- How's it going?
- My nose?
- No, with everything.
- Better. Sorry about Kaje.
- It sucks. How's the honker?
- I'm getting used to it.
- But I sure do snore.
- It suits you.
I was wondering... It's a tradition to
drink a beer together after a match.
- I don't drink beer.
- Me neither.
Since neither of us do,
it's probably not a good idea.
- I've quit my collection job.
- It's not that. It's not you.
I think it's best if I straighten
myself out first. Also in my head.
That's all it is.
The beer tradition doesn't exist.
I made it up.
I just wanted to see you.
I was just thinking...
If you need someone
to trust you, I'm willing to try.
- Just a little bit at a time, okay?
- Okay.
- I'll call you.
- I'll hold you to it.
A little at a time.
- Stop. 29. I won.
- Did you eat 29?
- I don't feel so good. But I won.
- Me neither.
What are you doing?
You want to bet that I can get
the remote in my mouth? Bet?
- You can't.
- Yes, I can.
Turn back the channel.
Come on, turn it back.
Move your finger,
so I can see it.
Stop it.
I can keep my head
under water for three minutes. I can!
- I don't believe you.
- Watch.
Two then.
I managed two.
Where are you?
