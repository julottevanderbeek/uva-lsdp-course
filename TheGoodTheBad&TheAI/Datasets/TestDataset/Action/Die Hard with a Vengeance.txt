LAMBERT: Record of aII coIIars
recentIy reIeased...
and anybody eIse
he might've Iooked at sideways.
FRED: Textbook megaIomania.
It's a pathoIogicaI state...
in whichfantasies of controI
or omnipotence predominate.
He wants controI over him--
over his actions, his thoughts--
even his emotions.
Sounds Iike a secret admirer,
John.
Yeah.
Maybe he'II send mefIowers.
LAMBERT: Everybody knows
you Iike pansies.
FRED: Notthat kind of emotion.
This guy is ugIy.
WALTER: How is that?
WOMAN: Nothing wrong with him
a showerwouIdn't cure.
Beer's normaIIy
taken internaIIy,John.
Just give me some aspirins,
wiII you?
WOMAN: OK. HoId this here.
WALTER: This is Fred SchiIIer,
John, and he's a--
JOHN:
A shrink. Yeah, I got it.
FRED: Yes. We're deaIing with
a megaIomaniacaI personaIity...
with possibIe
paranoid schizophrenic--
Let's skip
to where you expIain...
whatthefuckthis has
to do with me.
I don't know...
butwhat I do know is it
specificaIIy has to do with you.
This guy wants to pound you
untiI you crumbIe.
He wants you to dance
to his tune,then--
JOHN:
Put on a dress andfuck me?
I was going to say kiII you.
He's sitting on
an awfuI Iot of rage...
and it couId be manifested
physicaIIy if he's stressed.
WALTER: Somebody he arrested,
somebody he pissed off?
That couId be
one heII of a Iong Iist.
Fuckyou,Joe.
FRED: These peopIe don't Iike
to work anonymousIy.
They wantyou to know
who's doing it.
This name Simon probabIy
isn't an aIias.
It's probabIy Simon
or some variation.
LAMBERT: ''Simon, Robert E.
Busted in '86.
''Extortion. Kidnapping.
''Did seven years
for good behavior.
''ReIeased on a state
workfurIough two months ago.''
Thanks, Rick. Bob Simons
was a bankrupt businessman...
who kidnapped
his partner's daughter.
He's afuckup, not a psycho.
The guy we want is nuts.
A nutwho knows
a Iot about bombs.
Wefound this in a pIayground.
ProfessionaI. Very cooI stuff.
You know...boom.
WALTER: Thinkyou shouId
sIam it around, CharIie?
CHARLIE: It's unmixed.
You can't hurt it.
This stuff is cutting edge.
It's a binary Iiquid.
A what?
CHARLIE: Like epoxy.
Two Iiquids.
Either one by itself...
CHARLIE: ...you got nothing.
But mix them...
CHARLIE: Ricky.
KOWALSKI: Aah!
CharIie,you're gonna be wearing
that chair upyour ass!
Christ aImighty, CharIie!
Like I said,very cooI stuff.
With a package Iike this
you get a warning.
The bomb has to arm itself.
You'II see the red Iiquid pump
into the cIear...
before it detonates.
JOHN: How Iong before?
CHARLIE:
Ten seconds,two minutes.
CouId be anything.
But once it's mixed...
be somewhere eIse.
WALTER: This stuff
has gotto be pretty rare.
Find out if any of it
is missing somepIace.
LAMBERT: Livermore Labs--
Theft overthe weekend.
Got enough
to make another one,Joe?
About 2,000 pounds.
Of that?
CHARLIE: The detonating
mechanism can be anything--
radio, eIectricaI.
You couId use a beeper
and phone it in.
WOMAN: Inspector! It's him.
CHARLIE:
Bomb has a doubIe-feedback Ioop.
A nasty IittIe trick
used in Lebanon.
WALTER: CharIie. CharIie!
-Shh.
-What?
Wantto startthe trace?
Simon.
SIMON: He wore the board...
waIked the street,
and survived...
Hauptmann WaIter.
Where are my pigeons now?
WALTER: Pigeons?
SIMON: I had two pigeons,
bright and gay...
fIyfrom me the other day.
Why was itthey did go?
You cannotteII.
You do not know.
WALTER: You mean McCIane?
SIMON: No. I mean Santa CIaus.
JOHN: Yeah, I'm here.
SIMON: Ah. There after aII.
And yourfriend?
RICKY: Come on.
We need you in the other room.
Let's go. Come on.
WOMAN: They need you. Go.
JOHN: Yeah, he's here,too.
SIMON: May I speakwith him?
SIMON: Is the ebony Samaritan
there now?
ZEUS:
You got a probIem with ebony?
SIMON: No. My onIy probIem is
that I wentto some troubIe...
preparing that gamefor McCIane.
You interfered
with a weII-Iaid pIan.
ZEUS: You can stick
yourweII-Iaid pIan...
upyourweII-Iaid ass.
WALTER: Thatwas not smart.
There are Iives at stake here.
RICKY:
Not enough time, Inspector.
You better hope he caIIs back.
FRED: He wiII.
Ricky,teII those peopIe
to shutthe heII up outthere!
RICKY: Keep it down here!
Simon.
He wasn't speaking
for aII of us.
SIMON: Thatwas unpIeasant.
Don't Iet it happen again.
So what's your name, boy?
ZEUS: Don't caII me boy.
SIMON: I'm sorry.
Itwas a poor attempt at humor.
I was going to send you home
with a chiding...
but now I think--
RICKY: We got him.
It's a pay phone...in OsIo.
-They say it's Mexico.
-Norway?
Now they're saying
it's Juarez, Mexico.
KOWALSKI: Forget it.
He's scrambIing upthe system.
They don't know where he is.
SIMON: Havingfun
with the phone company, are we?
Simon says McCIane
and the Samaritan...
wiII go to the subway station
at 72nd and Broadway.
I'II caII you in 15 minutes...
on the pay phone
outside the station.
No poIice.
FaiIure to answer
wiII constitute noncompIiance.
Do you understand me,John?
JOHN: Oh,yes, I understand.
I understand
you're afucking wacko...
who Iikes to pIay kid's games.
-HardIy.
-HardIy?
JOHN: Then who are you,
somebody I sent up?
What did you do--
shopIifting,
purse-snatching...
cross-dressing,what?
SIMON:
You c-c-couIdn't catch me...
if I stoIe your ch-chair
with you in it.
My ch-ch-chairwith me in it?
Let me askyou a question,
bonehead--
why are you trying
to k-k-k-kiII me?
SIMON:
John,John, caIm yourself.
JOHN:
Why don'tyou come down here...
and we'IIfigure this out
Iike men?
SIMON: lf kiIIing you was aII
I wanted,you'd be dead now.
Simon,this is Inspector Cobb.
I can appreciate
yourfeeIingsfor McCIane...
but beIieve me,
the jerk isn'tworth it.
He stepped on so many toes
in this department...
next month
he'II be a security guard.
His wife wants nothing
to do with him...
and he's two steps shy
of becoming an aIcohoIic.
JOHN: One step, one step.
Now, Iisten to me.
You sound Iike a reaI smart guy.
What is ityou want?
SIMON:
Are you taIking about money?
WALTER:
WeII,whatever,whatever.
McCIane is a toiIet bug.
WhatwouId ittake...
justtoforget him
and Iive happiIy ever after?
SIMON: Money is shitto me.
I wouId not give up McCIane...
for aII the goId
in your Fort Knox.
McCIane and the Samaritan.
lf you're competent
in the Ieast...
you'vefound the briefcase...
so you know what I mean
by penaIty.
JOHN: I wantto thankyou
forthatvote of confidence.
WALTER:
I thought itwas worth a try.
This guy's a raving maniac.
FRED:
He couIdn't be any cIearer.
He gave you cIues
to his identity...
he spoke German...
he caIIed it ''your'' Fort Knox...
and he stammered
when McCIane pushed him.
WALTER: You beIieve
this guy reaIIy can't be bought?
The very mention of money
onIy enraged himfurther.
What's that?
WALTER: It's your shieId.
JOHN:
You asking me to be a cop again?
WALTER: Ricky, get him his gun.
JOHN: You didn't
answer my question.
Hey!
You didn't answer
my question,WaIter.
Are you done, Lieutenant?
WALTER: You two better Ieave
to getto 72nd Street on time.
Joe,they go with backup.
You got it.
Whoa,whoa,whoa.
I'm not going anywhere.
WALTER:
Simon says you gotto go.
I'm notjumping through hoops
for some psycho.
That's a white man
with white probIems.
CaII me when he crosses
JOHN: Hey.
Why'd you save my ass?
ZEUS: I didn't.
I stopped a white cop
from getting kiIIed in HarIem.
One white cop
gets kiIIed today...
tomorrow we got
aII of them with itchy
triggerfingers, got it?
Get him back.
Where'd youfind that bomb?
Chinatown.
Shit.
JOHN:
Yo. Yo, partner. Wait up.
ZEUS: Hey, hey,
I ain'tyour partner...
your neighbor,your brother,
oryourfriend.
I'm yourtotaI stranger.
JOHN: OK, stranger.
You know where that park is at
Yeah. That's in HarIem.
Where do you think
wefound that bomb?
Listen,this guy doesn't care
about skin coIor...
even if you do.
ZEUS: What am I doing?
JOHN: Cheer up.
Things couId be worse.
I was working
on a nicefat suspension...
smoking cigarettes,
and watching Captain Kangaroo.
Come on.
KOWALSKI: They're atthe phone,
butthere's a probIem.
WALTER: How big a probIem?
LAMBERT: Oh, about300 pounds.
JOHN: Excuse me, ma'am.
We need this phone
for officiaI poIice business.
Honey, I'm a cop.
I need the phone.
ZEUS: Get off the damn phone.
PoIice business.
WOMAN: WeII, I never!
ZEUS: I can get used to this.
JOHN:
Find a phone across the street.
I'm the onIy one here
on officiaI poIice business.
Don't do that shit again.
ZEUS: Let's get something eIse
straight--
you need me
more than I need you.
You don't Iike the way
I do things? I quit.
AII right, I need you.
I need you more
than you need me.
JOHN: HeIIo.
SIMON: Birds of afeather
fIocktogether.
So do pigs and swine.
Rats and mice
have their chance...
as wiII I have mine.
JOHN: Nice. Rhymes.
SIMON: Why was the phone busy?
Who were you caIIing?
JOHN: The psychic hot Iine.
SIMON: I'd advise you
to take this more seriousIy.
JOHN: It's a pubIic phone.
What shouId I say?
SIMON: SimpIy say there was
afatwoman on it...
and ittook a minute
to get her off.
Now,John,there's a significant
amount of expIosive...
in the trash receptacIe
nextto you.
Try to run,
and it goes off now.
JOHN:
I got a hundred peopIe out here.
SIMON: That's the point.
Now, do I have your attention?
As I was going to St. Ives,
I met a man with seven wives.
Every wife had seven sacks.
Every sack had seven cats.
Every cat had seven kittens.
Kittens, cats, sacks, and wives.
How many were going to St. Ives?
My phone number is 555--
JOHN: I didn't getthat!
Say it again!
SIMON: Not a chance.
My phone number is 555
and the answer.
CaII me in 30 seconds or die.
JOHN: Seven guys
with seven wives--
ZEUS: Shut up, McCIane.
JOHN:
Seven guys with seven wives--
ZEUS: He said seven wives
with seven sacks.
Seven times seven is 49.
TeII me the rest.
JOHN:
A sackwith--seven sacks--
-Weren'tyou Iistening?
-What's wrong with you?
JOHN:
A bad hangover,for one!
AII right.
Seven wives times seven--49...
with seven cats--
Seven times 49 is 343, right?
-Asking me orteIIing me?
-I'm teIIing you.
Three-forty-three
times seven is...
Two thousand,
four hundred and one.
-That's whatyou got right?
-Yeah.
JOHN: Is that it? 2401?
ZEUS:
That's it. DiaI 555-2401.
No,wait,wait! It's a trick.
Iforgot aboutthe man.
Fuckthe man!
We got 10 seconds!
ZEUS: He said how many
were going to St. Ives.
The riddIe begins,
''As I was going to St. Ives.''
The wives aren't going anywhere.
JOHN: What are they doing?
ZEUS:
How the heII shouId I know?
JOHN: Who's going to St. Ives?
ZEUS: Justthe guy.
Just one guy?
-The answer's one.
-How do you diaI one?
ZEUS: Five-five-five-
zero-zero-zero-one.
JOHN: Zero-zero-one.
Just one guy's going.
-HeIIo,John.
-Piece of cake.
Give us something
harder nexttime.
SIMON:
Butyou're 10 seconds Iate.
JOHN: No! The answer is one!
There's a bomb
in the trash can!
Get down! There's a bomb!
MAN: WeIcome to New York.
MAN: Yeah. Get up. Come on.
Come on. Let's go.
SIMON: Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

JOHN: Fuck.
ZEUS: Ninety bIocks in
It couId be doubIe that.
We don't even have a car!
Hey, hey, sir! I'm a cop.
I'm requisitioning this car
for officiaI poIice business.
Thanks very much. Get in.
ZEUS: Pretty sIick.
I used to drive a cab.
Thefastestway south is--Aah!
CAB DRIVER:
Whatthefuck are you doing?
You were saying?
I was saying,
I used to drive a cab...
and Ninth Avenue
is thefastestway south.
We seem to be going east.
Where the heII are you going?
Ninth Avenue's
the quickestway--
I know what I'm doing.
Not even God knows
whatyou're doing!
They're headed east
on 72nd towards the park.
WaII Street is south!
StopyeIIing. I got a headache.
The bestway south is not Ninth.
It's through the park.
Oh, dear.
I toId you.
Park Drive's aIways jammed.
I didn't say Park Drive.

I thought itwas
athIete'sfoot or something.
We read yourjacket, Lieutenant.
We were toId

There's a guy outthere

He caIIs himself Simon.
He speaks

Andfor some reason,
he's very angry with me.
And maybe you can

Thefirst man there

Thefirst man there

Now we beIieve he's working

WALTER: Working?
JARVIS: FreeIance terrorism,

in the East German Army.
Ran an infiItration unit...

Thankyou.
Your siIence

WALTER:
Did you say 2,400 pounds?
SIMON: Yes, but pIease

GentIemen,

SIMON: Pay phone beyond Hope.

Twenty minutes.
Go byfoot. No rush.
lf you're reaIIy cIever...
you'II Iearn the bomb's Iocation
and the code to disarm it.
By the way, gentIemen...
we got something of a bargain
on radio detonators.
The onIy probIem is...
the darn things respond
to poIice and FBIfrequencies.
lf I were you,
I'd keep off your radios.
WALTER: Simon,wait--
Twenty-four hundred pounds

Get me the commissioner.
WOMAN:

How can I heIp?
How many men you got?
Seventy-five.
I push the panic button...
I can get 500.
-When?

WALTER: Ricky,where are they?
RICKY: Right over here.
The senior man is Chief AIIen.
-Chief of what?
-Transit.
WALTER: Thanks, Ricky.
GentIemen,
we have a decision to make.
Chief AIIen,
the man who's done this...
has toId us he's pIanted
a very Iarge bomb...
in a New York schooI.
He's toId us
we cannot evacuate...
but he has not said
we cannot search.
I recommend we get everybody,
and I mean everybody--
poIice,transit,
sanitation,fire...
even the goddamn Iibrarians--
and we start
searching schooIs...
and I mean right now.
I'm taIking about
a thousand buiIdings...
and we have three hours
and 15 minutes to do it.
I'd Iike to keepthe media
out of this...
because if they get in,
we've got a panic.
Are we in agreement?
MAN:
Come on, guys, Iet's go!
They bought it.
You can begin.

Safe and secure.
You were concerned
about a currency exchange.
We are not

LITTLE:
Oh, no, Mr. VanderfIoog.
That's the vauIt eIevator.
I'm sorry.
Our aIarms

They don't reactweII
to expIosions.
This subway business
has knocked out aII our systems.
Infact,we gave up
and puIIed the pIug.
The repair peopIe
are downstairs now.
VANDERFLOOG: Good Lord.
LITTLE: Yeah.
Heavens to Betsy!

ZEUS: What's this gotto do

Life has its IittIe bonuses.
ZEUS: Didn'tyou say you didn't

drops him out a window.
I didn't even know
that motherfucker.
SIMON: I never invited you
aboard this ship.
ZEUS: No riddIe's going to stop

He's betrayed us.
The containers

You're onIy going
to bIow upwith me.
There's no goId on this boat.
How do you know?
I know thefamiIy.
OnIy thing better
than bIowing up $100 biIIion...
is making peopIe thinkyou did.
WeII,where is it?
He must have switched it
somewhere.
That supposed to make me
feeI better?
No. You're not going to die.
You know some coptrick
about handcuffs to get us out?
Yeah. Use a key.
You know how to pickthis Iock?
