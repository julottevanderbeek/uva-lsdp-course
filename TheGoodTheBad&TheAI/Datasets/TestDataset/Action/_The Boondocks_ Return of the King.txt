? I am the stone
The builder refused ?
? I am the visual
The inspiration ?
? That made lady
Sing the blues ?
? I'm the spark
That makes your idea bright ?
? The same spark
That lights the dark ?
? So that you can know
Your left from your right ?
? I am the ballot in your box
The bullet in the gun ?
? The inner glow
That lets you know ?
? To call your brother sun
The story that just begun ?
? The promise
Of what's to come ?
? Chop, chop, chop
Judo flip ?
? Chop, chop, chop
Judo flip ?
? Chop, chop, chop
Judo flip ?
HUEY:
Martin Luther King Jr.
Was shot in Memphis, Tennessee,
on April 4, 1968.
The world waited for news
of his fate.
Martin Luther King Jr.
came back.
King amazed the world when,
on November 2,
seven days after awaking
from a 30-year coma,
he showed up to vote in
the 2000 presidential election.
He was turned away
due to voting irregularities.
People took to the streets
to celebrate
Oh, shit!
My nigga MLK! Ha-ha!
Hey, what's up, folks?
Hey, that "got a dream" shit
was off the chain, nigga.
Okay...
Thank you very much.
HUEY: He learned that
streets named after him
King inked a seven-figure deal
to write his autobiography
Columbia Pictures green-lit
a $100 million biopic
of Dr. King,
starring Cuba Gooding Jr.
Oliver Stone was attached
to direct.
King mania was at a fever pitch
when on August 1, 2001,
Martin Luther King
presented Video of the Year
with Puffy
at the MTV Video Music Awards.
MAN:
I love you, MLK!
Well, you know, Puffy,
like you, I can't stop.
I won't stop.
I don't eeeeven know
how to stop.
MAN 2:
My nigga.
That's right.
Take that, take that.
MAN:
Whoo!
And now the nominees
for Video of the Year.
HUEY:
King was released
the week
of September 21, 2001.
during an appearance
on Politically Incorrect,
Dr. King, okay...
You're an advocate
of nonviolence, but guess what,
how do you think
the United States should respond
to the terror attacks of 9/11?
Well, as a Christian,
we are taught
that you should love thy enemy,
and if attacked,
you should turn the other cheek.
Wh-what?
HUEY:
America was outraged.
The president was very concerned
by some comments made
by some
"ex-civil rights leaders,"
and those people in question
should, uh...
watch their goddamn,
fuckin' mouths.
Of course, an al Qaeda lover
like Martin Luther King
wants us to just roll over
and let the terrorists win
Heh, go take another
30-year nap, Commie bastard.
HUEY: In December 2001,
MAN: Jack-off.
one of the ten most
unpatriotic Americans.
WOMAN:
Pansy faggot.
His book was canned.
Asshole.
King renamed his book
Dream Deterred,
and it was finally released
by a small publisher.
It was called "unimpressive"
Okay... now.
And who am I making this out to?
Huey Freeman.
GRANDDAD:
Son of a bitch tried to take
my parking spot.
I should have whupped his ass!
Robert Freeman?
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
I never thought
I'd see you again.
How you been?
Well, I was shot
and had a bit of a coma
for a few decades.
Yeah, I heard.
I sent you a card.
Did you get it?
Well... uh-
I-I don't remember.
Oh, you remember this one.
It was a get-well card
especially for people
who got shot,
and I thought this would be
perfect for Martin Luther King,
but they didn't
sell 'em separately.
I had to buy the whole pack.
You know, I've been
thinking about starting
my own greeting card line.
Hey.
You should come over for dinner.
I live right down the road.
Well, I believe I'm supposed
to be signing books
for a couple of more hours.
Dude, just go.
GRANDDAD:
Where they got you stayin'?
KING: I'm staying at a
Holiday Inn Express.
I feel smarter already.
Oh, that's nonsense...
RUCKUS:
You boycottin' baboon!
Dance there,
you goddamn chunky cheat monkey!
Ruckus, what the hell
is wrong with you?
Don't interfere, Robert.
This here's between me and
Martin Luther so-called King.
Only king I know
is Elvis Presley,
God rest his soul.
Oh, oh,
you don't remember me.
Well, I've been throwin' bricks
at your marchin' ass since 1959.
And so, brothers and sisters,
you know why...
RUCKUS:
Hey, shut the hell up,
you black son of a bitch!
What's wrong with y'all?
Thank God for the white man's
infinite mercy,
Martin Luther King.
'Cause if it was up to me,
I'd unleash the hound and turn
y'all niggers into puppy chow!
I was happy
at the back of the bus.
MAN:
Ow! My eyeball!
Just wait till I get me
another brick
or maybe a large rock
or, you know, one of them teeny,
tiny, little cement blocks.
Why'd you have to go mess with
the natural order of things?
I'd have shot you myself,
but I realized the white man
got better aim.
GRANDDAD:
Stop acting crazy.
We're going back
to my house for dinner.
Turn the other cheek
and take me with you.
I'm hungry.
You know, Robert,
I spoke to sister Rosa
before she passed.
She said you were
prank-calling her again.
She was lying.
She had the caller ID, Robert.
You prank-called
Rosa Parks?
She stole my thunder.
Robert, you got to let it go.
What did Rosa Parks
do to you?
KING: Robert was a member of
the Montgomery Bus Boycott.
Strategic Planning Committee
in 1955.
He was on that bus with
Sister Rosa that fateful day.
No.
Okay, this is it, brother.
Remember,
no matter what they do,
nobody gives up their seat.
Ya dig?
We shall not be moved.
Mm-hm.
Y'all can go ahead
on to the back.
We's movin',
Mr. Bossman.
We's movin'.
Lord, sure do wish
these here feets could move
faster for you, Mr. Bossman...
Move, boy.
MAN:
Had some roller skates on,
I could get back there
real quick.
This here far enough for you...
No.
Mr. Bossman?
I can press myself up against
the cold glass window.
MAN: This good?
You.
Go ahead to the back.
No.
I am not going to move.
Uh- Uh- Uh-
M- Mr. Bus Driver, sir?
She- She-
She ain't move.
How dare you refuse
to give up your seat, woman!
What are you, some kind
of history-making crusader
for justice?
Yes, we are!
You think you're gonna change
history on your own?
Is that it, woman?
All by yourself?
That lady sure has courage.
Hey! What-?
What about me?
I got courage.
MAN: You wants me to fetch the police
for you, Mr. Bus Driver, sir?
Get me the sheriff.
I got a colored woman who
don't wanna give up her seat.
MAN:
Stay strong, Sister Rosa!
MAN 2:
She's so brave!
WOMAN:
We'll love you forever!
That's right.
Take us to jail.
Stay out of trouble, nigger.
Robert, you didn't.
They laid her in state.
They ain't gonna lay
my black ass in state.
They gonna lay me
at the Johnson fuckin' Mortuary
down the damn street.
Mm-mm.
Yeah.
Hm!
Well, anyway, Dr. King,
I just wanted to say
that even though
you've been catching
a lot of flak recently,
we're very honored
to meet you, really.
Get off his dick.
Ow!
Man, I'm just sayin',
Mr. DuBois riding Dr. King
like a rodeo show.
Ow!
Stop it!
You don't look famous.
What are you, an actor?
Is you Morgan Freeman?
Ow!
Boy, stop acting crazy.
You know that's
Martin Luther King.
Now, go clear the dishes.
Why can't this
Morgan Freeman King dude
clear the dishes?
Shoot, the nigger just had
a free meal.
Riley, come here.
Get over here.
No.
How can you embarrass me
in front of Martin Luther King?
Stop, Granddad!
What is wrong with you?
Ow!
I hate Morgan Freeman King!
I wish he never came here!
? Move them butt
Move them butt ?
? Move them butt cheeks?
Oh, Lord.
Hm.
? I got that thugin' luv?
Hm.
What happened, Huey?
What happened to our people?
I think...
everyone was waiting
for Martin Luther King
to come back.
The Martin Luther King
they're waiting for, Huey,
is gone forever.
HUEY:
Dr. King?
Dr. King?
It's time to get up.
You got an interview today.
KING:
I'm not going.
I quit.
Dr. King!
KING:
I don't wanna. Mm-mm.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
you get out of that room
and continue to fight
for freedom and justice
this instant!
Come on.
Think about it,
Dr. King,
you missed out on four decades
of media evolution.
Oh, God!
Sorry, Mr. White Man, sir...
What the people need
is the truth.
And not the pretty truth.
The horrible, awful,
terrible truth
that hurts people's feelings.
The truth that makes
people get angry
and get up and do somethin'.
Huey, I just don't think
I belong in this new world.
I don't know if I need
the 20-gig iPod
or the 40-gig.
I tried to download
some Mahalia Jackson,
but I lost
my iTunes password.
I really should have approvals
over this kind of thing.
A political party?
Not just any political party,
a black revolutionary
political party.
But why me?
You should ask Oprah to do it.
She's more popular,
and if you ask me,
a darn pretty lady.
Oh, snap.
No, they didn't.
A boneless rib sandwich.
What will they think of next?
I know I shouldn't eat these,
but they're for
a limited time only.
Oh...
I really should have approvals
over this kind of thing.
And so the philosophy
of this new political party
might be considered
extremely leftist by some...
Do you love America?
I'm sorry?
You sure as hell are, buddy.
Why can't liberals ever answer
that question
with a simple yes, huh?
If you ask me if I love
America, I say yes!
Why can't you say yes?
Say you love America right now.
Say it.
The party's basic philosophy
is...
Say it!
Sir, I will not be...
Say it or shut up!
We'll be back with more fair
and balanced coverage after...
Oh!
MAN: He just hit him! He...
HUEY:
I thought that went well.
You know, Huey,
those of us who do adhere
to the philosophy
of nonviolence,
frown upon the throwing
of furniture
to resolve
our political differences.
Where did people go for
information before cable news?
We can do it like we did
back in the day.
We'll go into the streets
and tell the people.
? I wish the president
Would stop lyin' ?
? And young brothers'd
Stop dyin' ?
? I wish the police'd
Stop killin' ?
? And actin' like
They not dealin' ?
? When they know they got
Bricks in the street ?
? At the country club ?
? Fixin' to eat?
DJ:
What up, y'all?
You got it locked
on WFRK, The Freak.
That was my main man
Gangstalicious
WOMAN:
Hello? Am I caller 13?
DJ: You sure are.
And you know what that means?
WOMAN: What?
DJ: It means you're going
to the Martin Luther King
emergency action partay!
Oh, my God!
I can't believe it!
DJ: It's gonna be
all the way live,
and, baby girl, you're gonna
be in the building.
Tell me the station
that's helping you
shake your stankin' ass
with Martin Luther King.
WOMAN:
WFRK, The Freak!
Dr. King, why are they
giving away tickets
to our emergency action
planning meeting
on 95.5, WFRK, The Freak?
Well, Huey, I thought
about what you said
about not having enough
experience with modern media,
so I hired an urban promotions
firm to help get the word out.
Uh-oh. Was that bad?
Huey, are you sure
we're in the right place?
MAN: I'm on Ray-Ray's list.
Check the list for Ray-Ray.
Excuse me, bro.
MAN:
Awww!
What's up?
My name is Huey...
I'll tell you right now,
y'all ain't gettin' in
without no female.
What? Sir, we need
to get in 'cause I...
I'll tell you right now,
you ain't gettin' in
with them shoes.
What's wrong with my shoes?
Excuse me, sir.
I'm Martin Luther King.
And I'm Malcolm X, nigger.
You still ain't gettin'
in here with them shoes.
Sir, please?
Young man, I...
Mm... 50 bucks.
What?
Fifty bucks each.
You want to get in or not?
MAN:
Aw, yeah. Come on.
Yeah, uh-huh.
Oh, hell nah!
Come on.
Yo, we gotta get back there.
I tell you right now,
You ain't gettin' back here
without a wristband.
A what?
A wristband.
Hey.
This is Martin Luther King.
I'm surprised they let you
in here with those shoes.
MAN:
I'm just sayin',
I'm just sayin' it's only right
if you recognize all the kings.
The Kings of Comedy,
the king of rap,
Rodney King, the king of beer,
King Kong, Don King.
MAN: All right!
Whoo!
That nigga was deep.
Okay, we all got to stop and
give thanks to my nigga God.
Thank you, white Jesus,
for making all this positive
black shit possible. Amen.
Okay. Let's keep
this motherfucker movin'!
Ha-ho!
HUEY:
While we waited,
was everything
you expected it would be.
There were
the hustler preachers.
And that's why you have
to go buy my new book,
so God can help you lose weight
and get a husband
with the benefits.
HUEY:
The rapper truce.
HUEY: Oh, yeah, and there was
also the inevitable fight.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, security!
Come get
these ghetto-ass niggas!
Niggas always gotta mess
some shit up! Damn!
BOUNCER:
Out of the club!
Excuse me.
Brothers and sisters, please.
If someone could
just turn off...
HUEY:
King looked out on his people
and saw they were
in great need.
So he did
what all great leaders do.
Will you ignorant niggers
please shut the hell up?!
He just said
what I think he said?
Is this it?
This is what I got all
those ass-whuppings for?
I had a dream once.
It was a dream
that little black boys
and little black girls
would drink
from the river of prosperity,
freed from the thirst
of oppression.
But lo and behold,
some four decades later,
what have I found
but a bunch of trifling,
shiftless,
good-for-nothing niggers?
And I know some of you don't
want to hear me say that word.
It's the ugliest word
in the English language,
but that's what I see now:
niggers.
And you don't want
to be a nigger
'cause niggers are
living contradictions.
Niggers are full
of unfulfilled ambitions.
Niggers wax and wane.
Niggers love to complain.
Niggers love to hear themselves
talk, but hate to explain.
Niggers love being
another man's judge and jury.
Niggers procrastinate
until it's time to worry.
Niggers love to be late.
Niggers hate to hurry!
Black Entertainment Television
is the worst thing
I've ever seen in my life.
Usher, Michael Jackson
is not a genre of music!
And now I'd like
to talk about Soul Plane.
I've seen what's
around the corner.
I've seen what's
over the horizon,
and I promise you, you niggers
have nothing to celebrate.
I know
I won't get there with you.
I'm going to Canada.
Thank you, Huey.
Thank you, Dr. King.
Do what you can.
HUEY: That was the last
time I saw Dr. King,
but the story
doesn't end there.
King's speech was replayed
the entire next day
Then something unexpected
happened.
Nobody knows exactly
what to attribute
to the sharp decline in
African American dropout rates.
ANNOUNCER: -That is every
African American player
until there is
a full troop withdrawal-
-billionaire Bob Johnson
apologizing to black America
are receiving an unprecedented
amount of calls
HUEY: And the revolution
finally came.
REPORTER: The mob is
refusing to disperse.
The president
is urging everyone
to stay calm
and obey the curfew.
You're horrible!
You liar!
MAN: Murderer!
SOLDIER: Fire!
MAN 2:
Come on! Go, go, go, go, go!
HUEY:
It's fun to dream.
