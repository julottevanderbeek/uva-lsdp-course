RICO:
I always get the shakes
before a drop.
I had the injections.
Hypnotic prep.
The Federation shrink scanned
my brainwaves.
Everything checked out.
Doc says it wasn't fear.
I could've told him that.
A horse locked
in the starting gate isn't afraid.
He's just ready to run.
DAUGHERTY:
A-Team.
Our mission is to seize and control
the B-Dock area,
clear away the bugs,
and evac the survivors.
Now, once we land, we join forces
with the K-12 team
at the fort. It's a standard
grab and go. After the rescue,
we return to the ship, take off,
then we blow the fort
and the bugs.
Are we clear?
ALL: Loud and clear, sir!
DAUGHERTY:
Go, go, go!
DAUGHERTY:
Report.
GUNFODDER: Pretty bad.
Some of our men are in the far corridor.
DAUGHERTY:
Let's get them out of there.
Mech, we're done here. Prep to blow.
MECH: Sir.
Holyman and Chow, on the cover.
Biggers and Crysoch hold position.
The rest of you, follow me.
We're on a rescue mission, people!
JONAH :
Lieutenant Daugherty.
What is your status?
DAUGHERTY:
Too many bugs.
No way to take back Fort Casey.
Will hold till the John A. Warden
evacuates.
Alesia will stand by for immediate evac.
Keep me posted.
DAUGHERTY:
Roger that. Mech!
What's your ETR?
MECH:
Almost there, sir.
Done. Let's go.
DAUGHERTY:
Charleston's down!
Medic!
SHOCK JOCK: I'm on it.
CARL:
Have you completed
loading the crates?
No. That is your priority.
Hm.
What the hell is this about, Carl?
Wonderful to see you again,
Carmen.
You commandeered my damn ship.
Borrowing it. I'll give it back.
You're never gonna take
the John A. Warden from me.
Guards, I believe Captain Ibanez
needs an escort to the Alesia.
What do you want
with my ship, Carl?
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Carmen, that's
classified. But I can tell you this.
This mission--
Oh, this mission will turn the tide.
You always were
such an asshole.
And I was always so fond of you
as well, Carmen.
See you on Terra.
Friends always, right?
DAUGHERTY:
A-Team, reload.
This is A-Team leader
to Fort Casey. Evacs, come in.
MAN :
About goddamn time.
It's a little crowded out here.
Exit now. Dock B.
On our way.
Show some hustle. It's quiet now,
but that ain't gonna last.
Evacs coming out. Keep your
eyes open and your heads down!
I don't wanna lose
anyone to friendly fire!
Who's in charge?
Acting commander, sir.
Major Henry Varro
has been relieved of duty.
Relieved?
What the hell happened?
This was a suicide
mission from the get-go,
fucking head case.
BUGSPRAY:
Shut your mouth, Ratzass.
You wanna be busted like Hero?
DAUGHERTY:
We're out of here!
Let's get back to the ship.
Mech! How's it coming
with that charge?
MECH:
Armed and dangerous.
DAUGHERTY:
You have to be kidding me.
Thanks for waiting, jackass!
Command! If there are new orders,
let me know, goddamn it!
Are we gonna escort
the John A. Warden or not?
MAN:
Behind us!
BIGGERS:
Sir! This is Biggers!
Can't hold any more! We're--
Aah!
You bug sons of bitches! Aah!
DAUGHERTY:
Captain Jonah, This is A-Team.
Landing ship destroyed.
Boarding directly now.
JONAH :
Roger that. As soon as you're aboard,
Alesia will depart.
DAUGHERTY:
Wedge formation!
Fall back into the Alesia!
Hold formation.
Hold formation.
My arm! My goddamn arm!
MAN:
Medic!
Four-twenty-four,
DAUGHERTY:
Return to the ship!
TRIG:
Four-twenty-eight, 429,
DAUGHERTY :
Trig! Move your goddamn ass.
We're taking off.
DAUGHERTY:
Come on!
BUGSPRAY:
Jump!
Thanks.
Anytime.
Score?
TRIG: Four-thirty.
Give or take.
CHASE:
You gonna do it or what?
Hit it, maestro.
Three,
two, one, boom.
Oh, come on, guys.
This shit ain't over yet.
MAN:
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah. All right.
So, what the hell happened
to you guys down there?
We were right on top
of a motherfucking ant hill.
Varro saved our ass.
Then that ESP prick, Jenkins,
sent us on a death run.
Straight into
a goddamn hive.
But you didn't hear
that shit from me.
Uh, I'm sorry,
you say something?
DAUGHERTY:
Attention!
You can all be proud of yourselves.
We saved some lives.
And we killed some bugs.
But we lost
some good troopers today.
Here's to the dead.
ALL: And to the next man to die!
Now let's get back to Terra.
And we can put some real glasses
in these hands.
Heh. Check it out.
What's the matter? You never saw
a flanker without her armor before?
Yeah. But they usually
look like Ratzass.
Ratzass?
Heh. That's what they call me.
Because you don't give
a rat's ass about anything.
What a surprise.
Hey,
you want me to show you
to the shower?
I could wash your back.
You don't wanna wash my front?
Hm.
Shh. Shut up.
OFFICER:
Captain on the bridge.
Stand down. This is
your ship, not mine, captain.
Simple respect,
Captain Ibanez.
For what happened on Planet-P
Venta Monis alone.
If only more strikes
were executed that way.
I had a good team.
What can you tell me?
About?
Where's my ship?
And why does Jenkins
want it so badly?
Believe me, if I could provide you
with any information--
This ship is in pursuit
of the John A. Warden, isn't it?
I understand your concern
for the John A. Warden,
Captain Ibanez,
but this is the Alesia
and we command it.
Our orders are to return to Terra.
Then show me the data
on the John A. Warden's path.
Where's she headed?
We don't know, captain.
We lost her signal
shortly after we began pursuit.
Please contact me when you
find the John A. Warden.
Aye, aye, captain.
GUNFODDER:
Hey, man.
Don't write this up, okay?
This is a serious wound.
Could've been a lot worse.
I can't keep something like this
off the record. I--
I'm gonna have to take your arm.
Fine.
But, look, at least do
what you can to make sure
it doesn't get back to my folks.
You can at least do that,
right, doc?
Let's do this.
Um,
why don't we wait
till the shaking stops?
The ship will be fine.
I'm not talking about the ship.
Oh.
Hey, newb. Dance class
is down the hall.
No. It's right here.
Care to dance?
Heh. This ring is for fighting.
Humor me.
What's your name?
Chow.
Well, Chow,
I don't usually dance with guys,
but in your case, heh,
I'll make an exception.
Who's your money on?
Ratzass is bigger.
Not much upstairs--
Whatever, dude.
Ratzass gets in one good solid hit
and Chow's going down.
Shit, if he can ever
land a punch.
Chow's fast, man.
All right, fighters,
to your corners.
RATZASS:
You back out now,
I won't think any less of you.
When I ring the bell,
come out fighting.
They're gonna miss you
when you're gone.
Hm.
Aw...
Good thing
there's not much upstairs.
Don't have to worry
about brain damage.
Hey, damage this.
Hey.
CHASE:
Did you see that?
Didn't know you had it in you.
Flash of inspiration. Unh.
E057, E057.
E057.
BUGSPRAY:
Thanks, I really appreciate...
it.
Hm.
They can't get me a bed
till tomorrow.
Thanks for letting me use
the com...?
Tia.
Tia Durer. Trig is fine.
Otis Hacks. Bugspray.
Hey, uh...
Thanks for the catch.
At Fort Casey.
Sleeping with a gun?
You must know something
I don't.
Morita XXX sniper rifle.
Classic.
Hm.
You've got a nice smile
for a psych job.
Thanks...
I think.
So up for a little training?
I think I've had about all
the target practice
I can stand today.
Yeah. I was thinking about
something a little more strenuous.
You didn't really use
the intercom, did you?
Would you like to know more?
Heh.
Oh.
Everyone's doing their part.
Major Henry Varro.
One of the most decorated
officers in the Federation.
You've run long-range ops
in places even God's given up on.
What did you do?
Why won't you talk?
And why won't your men talk?
Heh.
There are modifications
you can score on the black market
when you get to Terra.
But as far as what
the Federation will pay for,
it's still a good prosthetic.
Got it.
Nice job. Don't know
what you were nervous about.
I bet this looks as good
as all the others.
What others?
You're my first.
Matter of fact, you're the first guy
I've worked on that's actually lived.
TRIG:
Every commander
I've ever served under
tries to get me to use
a regulation gun.
That is, until they see
how many I kill with that one.
Then they don't ask me anymore.
My parents made that rifle.
There was an armory
in my home town.
Everyone worked there.
That is, until the bugs melted
the place with a plasma bomb.
Soldiers, civilians, families.
Everyone died.
I swore then
that I'd kill just as many bugs.
And I'd do it with that gun.
That's why you count?
TRIG:
No. That's why it counts.
Goddamn you, Carl.
Where'd you learn that haymaker?
Dance class.
Shit. I knew it. I just felt it.
We aren't gonna see Terra
any time soon.
Aw, you're a pessimist.
Specialist, actually.
Well, almost.
Five points short
on the ESP test.
If one more jack
had been a diamond,
I wouldn't be here
with you dumbasses.
You son of a bitch.
That's how you always know
when I'm in the shower.
So can you tell
what I'm thinking now?
MECH:
Hell, even I know
what you're thinking now.
You make me sick.
Hm.
What's up, Lieutenant Daugherty?
I thought you were in Medical.
Ah, wasn't as bad
as it looked.
Ah.
Glad you two could make it.
MAN 1: Ow!
MAN 2: Whoo!
RICO:
At ease.
I wanted to brief you all
personally, ﬁrst and foremost
because I know the sacriﬁces
that both the crew
of the Alesia as well as
the defenders of Fort Casey
have made
and the great losses
that you've suffered.
And second, I know you could
all use some R&R about now.
Believe me, I've been there myself.
But, unfortunately,
we have a situation.
MAN 3: What?
Stow it.
The John A. Warden
has gone silent.
The Alesia is the only starship
in the area of last contact.
I have ordered your captain
to divert course,
ﬁnd the Warden, and investigate.
Any questions?
Yeah.
I speak for everyone
from Fort Casey when I say this.
Shut the fuck up.
It's okay. Go on.
We're only going in
if Hero takes point.
Hero?
Major Henry Varro,
Commander of Fort Casey,
General Rico.
Right.
Arrested by Dr. Carl Jenkins
for insubordination
at the battle of Fort Casey.
Fine. If Major Varro chooses
to participate in this mission,
the mobile infantry
will accept his service.
However, this will not,
in any way
be prejudicial to his trial,
is that understood?
Understood, sir.
We'll probably lose communications
as you cross the nebula.
Godspeed, Alesia. Dismissed.
DAUGHERTY:
Assemble in the staging area.
A word, Captain Ibanez.
Why did you let him take my ship?
Carmen, it's not your ship.
It belongs to the Terran Federation.
General Rico, perhaps you recall
there was a certain young trooper
who was with me when
the Roger Young went down.
I vowed that would never happen
to a ship under my command.
This is not my choice.
I mean, look, I don't care
what you thought of Carl
back when we knew him
and I don't care what you think now.
He's minister of Paranormal Warfare
and high command has authorized
him to use the John A. Warden.
Look, Carmen, this is a mission
that's so classiﬁed,
I don't even know what--
Look how well it's going.
You know the John A. Warden
like the back of your hand.
I need you to go aboard
with the insertion team.
I looked at the manifest.
That ship didn't just go dark.
Her signal was turned off.
And you know as well as I do,
the only one
who has the gall to run a Federation
starship dark is Carl Jenkins.
And how do you know
we're even close to my ship?
Before we lost contact,
we analyzed some of
the scattered signals.
Calculating course and speed,
we were able to get
a good estimate of its location.
Now, it's not spot on,
but we can get you
pretty damn close.
Fine. I'll do it.
But not to save Carl's sorry ass.
I'll do it to take back my ship.
You just be careful.
We need you back intact
when this thing is over.
Thank you, Johnny.
Hey, Carmen,
when this thing is over,
maybe you and I can
meet at Zim's and, uh... Uh...
Yeah. Yeah. Sheesh.
I gotta tell you.
This will in no way
be prejudicial to your trial.
Aw, come on. I didn't have
anything to do with any of this.
I'm just the damn janitor
trying to clean it up.
Look, major,
I'm no more enthusiastic
about saving Carl Jenkins
than you are.
But your men want you.
And something tells me
we're gonna need you.
Hm.
MAN :
Lieutenant Daugherty,
we've found the John A. Warden.
Tell Captain Jonah to move
to standoff range. I'll be right up.
So which is it?
Get these chains off me.
It'd be too bad
if a stray shot hit Jenkins.
I know you're pissed
but don't think shit like that.
They threw Hero into the brig.
You or me, Holyman or Kharon,
what do you think they'd do
to grunts like us?
They'd shove us
out of a goddamn airlock.
So I gotta watch my ass?
Yeah.
But if you're not gonna do that,
at least watch mine.
Oh. Oh, man, fuck you.
Can't believe I'm the only one
not getting laid around here.
Looks like you've got
your bases covered.
Tell me, Holyman,
which one's gonna save you today?
I can take care of myself.
Women, they make
the highs higher and
the lows more frequent.
Are atheists
the only philosophers
you can quote?
I find that believers
such as you say so few things
worth writing down.
And I've found that he who looks
so forward to the abyss
is simply afraid of the light.
Hm.
I'm gonna go get you a pen.
Wait, did you just make that up?
No, no, I'm not writing that down.
John A. Warden, this is the Alesia,
please respond.
I've tried everything.
Voice, radio flash,
even light code. Nothing.
Keep trying, lieutenant.
IBANEZ: Zoom in on the bridge.
JONAH:
Maybe they can't hear us.
They'd have to know
what our objective is.
Bridge, this is your captain.
Respond now.
If you do not respond, we will board.
Board it.
That's not my ship anymore.
RATZASS:
Kids?
Husband?
Died on Planet 4976.
Hey, the way I figure it,
the bug's got more reason
to be scared than I do.
I've killed hundreds of them,
they killed zero of me.
Uh--
Oh, man.
TRIG:
Listen.
I want you to do me a favor.
Yeah?
If I don't make it, I don't care
what happens to my body.
But try to get my rifle scope,
will you?
And have it buried
in my home town.
Look, I don't like funerals.
Do me a favor. Don't get killed.
Heh.
Okay, boys and girls.
Looks like this is gonna be
my last mission.
So let's make it a good one.
Our job is to retake
the John A. Warden,
rescue any and all survivors
and exterminate any resistance
we might find.
You got that?
ALL:
Sir, yes, sir!
All right, troopers,
let's get the lady her ship back.
ALL:
Hoo-ah!
JONAH :
Initiate docking procedure.
MAN:
Initiating docking procedure.
Team one:
Lieutenant Daugherty,
Ice, Trig, Mech,
Shock Jock leading
Captain Ibanez to the bridge.
Team two: Chase, Kharon, Chow,
Bugspray, Gunfodder, Ratzass,
Holyman, and the rest, you're
coming with me to the engine room.
Don't know what we're gonna find
in there so be ready for anything.
Let's go.
MAN :
Gravity zero, oxygen level yellow,
ready to board the John A. Warden.
DAUGHERTY:
We're in.
Team one moving toward the bridge.
HERO:
Team two boarding.
Moving toward the engine room.
DAUGHERTY:
Something up ahead.
No...
Oh, my God.
DAUGHERTY:
Team two, we've got
bodies near the bridge.
HERO:
We've got bodies everywhere.
CHASE:
Ugh. Man, they've been bug-ripped.
HERO:
Infestation confirmed.
Stay sharp, people.
DAUGHERTY :
Nearing objective.
Daugherty to team two,
we're on the bridge.
And it ain't pretty.
Got multiple casualties...
and one dead bug.
All clear.
Shock Jock.
SHOCK JOCK:
Massive tearing wounds.
Oh, my God.
My crew.
DAUGHERTY:
Bridge is secure. Team two,
what's your status? Over.
HERO:
Entering engine room now, over.
CHASE:
Fucking bloodbath.
Team two scout.
I've got dead troopers and bugs.
RATZASS: Holy shit.
KHARON: Amen.
Why'd they all die here?
HERO:
Focus on the mission, troopers.
Chow, prep the engines.
CHOW:
Yes, sir.
CHASE:
Major, I have a survivor.
HERO:
Well, find him.
Chow, what's the status
on that engine?
CHOW: Give me 10.
HERO: You've got five.
CHOW: Yes, sir.
HERO: Team one,
engine's operative in five.
DAUGHERTY:
That a real ﬁve minutes
or a "sort of" ﬁve minutes? Over.
HERO:
Hard five. And we've got
a possible survivor.
Going to investigate, over.
Gunfodder, have team
hold position. Bugspray
and Ratzass, cover Chow.
RATZASS:
Like paint, major.
CHASE:
Looks like they were trying
to make this into a lab.
What is that thing?
HERO:
Holding cell. To keep a bug inside.
Now it looks like they're trying to
keep them out and somebody else in.
Emergency power supply
from Alesia seems to be working.
Team one, team two.
Gravity restoration in five,
four, three, two...
RATZASS:
Fuck!
Internal Oxygen level is green.
DAUGHERTY:
I'd feel a whole lot better if I knew
what happened to those bugs.
Wouldn't we all?
Who's there?
HERO:
Major Varro.
JENKINS :
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be on trial.
Yeah, well, looks like that plan
was about as successful
as your little experiment here.
What happened on this ship,
Jenkins?
I hacked her. So she hacked me.
She? What do you mean,
"she"?
Worthy opponent.
She hacked everything.
Me, the ship, everything!
Well, of course she did.
She knew what I was thinking.
Thoughts become words,
words become deeds.
Thoughts become words,
words become deeds.
We're gonna get you out.
You and I can settle our score later.
Open the door, Jenkins.
And let you kill me? No!
Besides. It's safer in here.
Safest place on the ship.
Safe place, yes, safe place,
my safe house.
Open the door, Jenkins.
You think it's funny?
Turning tables, tables turned.
I arrested you,
now I'm the one in the cage.
You think that's funny, do you?!
Do you?!
I'll leave your ass here,
don't think I won't.
You figure it out
while we clear the ship.
Have this door opened
by the time we get back.
There's nothing to clear!
The crew's dead. Everyone 's dead.
Darkness, darkness is your friend.
Whatever you do,
don't turn on the lights.
Let there be light.
Yes.
Varro to Chow.
Do not restart the engines.
Varro to Chow, do not
restart engines. Do you copy?
Don't be afraid of the dark.
Good job, Chow. Bridge is green.
HERO:
Chase!
Grenade!
Bugs! We got bugs!
Multiple contacts.
Holy shit!
KHARON:
Is that abyss
you were talking about?
BUGSPRAY:
Engine room under attack!
DAUGHERTY:
Take positions. They're coming.
CHOW:
Whoa!
Get back to the airlock.
Move and fire!
HOLYMAN:
No!
I'll draw them off. You go!
Unh!
HOLYMAN:
No, we're not leaving him.
KHARON :
Go. I'll see you on the other side.
BUGSPRAY:
Holyman, in formation and fire!
Die, bugs!
You think I give a rat's ass if I die?
Aah!
BUGSPRAY:
This way!
Get to the airlock.
Bridge, we're heading to the airlock.
And they are right on our ass.
DAUGHERTY:
Roger that.
HERO:
Goddamn it.
MAN 2:
Bug!
RATZASS:
Chow!
Run!
IBANEZ:
Alesia, we are under
massive bug attack!
Request immediate evac.
Repeat, request immediate evac.
JONAH :
Roger that. Alesia is preparing
for your retrieval.
DAUGHERTY:
Let's go.
JONAH:
This is Alesia.
Ready for your arrival, over.
Unh!
GUNFODDER:
It's jammed!
Don't suppose you have a good
replacement pan to fix this.
You're gonna make it.
Oh, that's right.
You can't let me die.
I'm the only one of
your patients that's lived.
HERO:
Open the air lock.
Shock Jock, you go first.
SHOCK JOCK: Yes, sir.
What the hell? Evasive action.
ICE BLONDE:
Shock Jock!
DAUGHERTY:
What the hell just happened?
The Alesia's gone.
Did we just fire on them?
Alesia, Captain Jonah, answer me.
Listen up, everybody.
We head to the bridge now.
Since when is she giving the orders?
Since we boarded her ship.
Just asking.
Bugs!
JENKINS :
I hacked her, so she hacked me.
I hacked her, so she hacked me.
I hacked her, so she hacked me.
I hacked her, so she hacked me. I...
Are you all right, captain?
IBANEZ:
You know,
if I wanted to run this much,
I would have joined
the mobile infantry.
Captain Ibanez to the L-6 Base.
High command,
this is the John A. Warden.
Johnny, please respond.
Communication is always jaggy
near wormholes.
Recommend we position ourselves
away from the nebula.
How did the cannons fire?
And why target our own ship?
Jenkins tried to warn us.
Carl is alive?
Locked himself in a bug cage.
And you're just now telling me this?
Look, captain, if you're ready
for a full debriefing, I'm all for it.
Hero.
Jenkins found a queen on Fort Casey.
He ordered us to capture it alive.
What the--?
Tell her the rest, major.
IBANEZ:
Yes, major. Tell me the rest of it.
I knew trying to take the queen
would result in heavy casualties.
I wasn't gonna sacrifice my men
for a bug hunt.
So that's why
he had you arrested.
But he got the queen
after all.
Wait a minute. How the hell
can a bug control a starship?
HERO:
You're gonna have to ask
Jenkins that.
MAN:
What the--?
We're moving.
Where?
No idea.
But if the queen is in control--
Need to stop her from getting there.
How?
Back to the engine room.
Shut them down.
Negative. Not enough
soldiers or ammo.
What the hell are you doing?
Praying.
Well, keep it up.
We're gonna need
all the help we can get.
BUGSPRAY:
Now we're back in business.
DAUGHERTY:
Captain, you need
to take a look at this.
IBANEZ:
She's heading straight
for the Marjizon wormhole.
It'll take her
straight to Earth.
This is Captain Ibanez
to the L-6 Base.
Captain Ibanez calling L-6 Base.
This is Captain Ibanez
to Johnny Rico.
L-6 Base come in.
This is Captain lb--
What the hell
are you doing?
If she is in the engine room,
then I'm gonna hunt her down.
I'll back you up.
No. You stay.
Besides, you'll never be able
to fit through here.
I'll be back.
You're not gonna stop her?
ICE BLONDE:
She's a big girl.
She knows what she's doing.
Do we?
I bypassed the circuit board.
If we can gain control
without being detected...
Strap yourselves in.
I'm not gonna sit in that blood seat.
Do it.
She's onto us.
Damn it.
Fire!
WOMAN:
General.
A Federation starship has just
emerged from the Marjizon Wormhole.
It's... It's the John A. Warden.
On screen.
They're receiving our signal, sir.
Any response?
No, sir, they're not responding.
Something's wrong.
Why would they head back
towards Earth?
Sir, if they keep their current
trajectory, the John A. Warden...
Sir, it's heading straight for us.
John A. Warden.
This is General Rico. Come in.
John A. Warden,
this is the L-6 Base.
If you do not change course
immediately,
we will be forced to engage.
Repeat, the L-6 Base
will take defensive action
if you do not change course.
John A. Warden, respond.
Talk to me, Carmen.
Aah!
The L-6 Base.
We've got to warn Johnny.
Morse code.
We can't use the beacon.
She has control of the ship.
Yeah?
She doesn't have control of this.
WOMAN:
General. There's fire on the bridge
of the John A. Warden.
RICO:
Get me a closer look at that ship.
It's Morse code.
They're trying to send us
a message.
Repeat. Bugs in control.
How the hell do bugs
control a starship?
Goddamn you, Carl.
Deployment status?
WOMAN:
Sheridan, Ishizuka, and the Franklin
are heading to intercept.
WOMAN:
The Sheridan has taken
catastrophic damage.
The Franklin is critical
but operational.
Franklin, disengage.
Get clear of the John A. Warden.
WOMAN:
The John A. Warden's approaching,
on a crash course.
Ready to intercept, sir.
Main cannon armed and ready.
Carmen...
Carl...
Commander!
Open...
fire!
Fire!
Sir. We can't fire now.
They're too close.
They missed us, sir.
Yeah. But why?
Commander,
I have the Warden's trajectory.
It's heading straight for the Earth.
RICO:
They never meant to ram us.
We were just in their way.
RICO:
This is General Rico
to Earth Defense Command.
The John A. Warden
is under bug control
and entering Earth's atmosphere.
It's what? The John A. Warden?
Rico, I don't care if John A. Warden
is on that ship himself,
if that ship is infested,
you take it down.
Just give me a chance to do both, sir.
Rescue our men and gain control.
Rico...
Commander, I promise.
A bug invasion will not happen
on my watch, sir.
It better not.
Spaceborne command.
Prepare a drop.
BUGSPRAY:
What now?
Daugherty, you stay here
and protect the captain.
The rest of you, lock and load.
It's time we exterminate that bitch.
ALL:
Hoo-ah!
IBANEZ:
She's trying to crash the ship.
DAUGHERTY:
Do what you have to do!
I don't know what to do.
Trig, where are you now?
Trig, location?
Trig, come in.
Trig, respond.
Where are you? Trig!
TRIG :
Central storage area.
Have you found the queen?
TRIG:
Oh, yeah. This bitch is disgusting.
Take her out.
Done.
IBANEZ:
We're running out of time.
Do you read me?
Loud and clear, captain.
Shit.
In that case...
That's it.
Oh, shit.
Four-thirty-eight, 439.
Four-forty...
Trig...
All hands, prepare for impact.
HERO:
Magnetic stabilizers on.
All hands, report.
Can anybody hear me?
Hero.
Anybody?
Lieutenant.
Thank you.
COMMANDER:
Rico, you're not a trooper anymore.
Remember that.
RICO:
I'm always a trooper.
And if there are any of our men alive
on that ship,
I'm getting them out.
COMMANDER:
Should've known you'd say that.
Kill them any way you can.
Kill them all.
In T-minus 30, we'll send nukes
to sanitize that site.
So be out of there before we hit.
Don't wait for me.
If I'm not out in 30, nuke it.
HOLYMAN:
Ice! Unh!
Holyman!
BUGSPRAY:
What the hell kind of bug is that?
Fuck me!
I was just starting to believe you.
HERO: Fall back now!
RICO:
Troopers.
Our mission is to storm the wreck
of the John A. Warden,
rescue our surviving men
and kill every last
son-of-a-bitch bug we see.
Do you understand?
ALL : Yes, sir!
We've got 25 minutes
before they level that site.
So move fast. And remember.
We're not fighting for some rock
across the galaxy.
We're fighting for our home!
Commence the attack.
MAN : Over here.
This way.
Are you all right, captain?
IBANEZ: Yeah.
Thanks.
Come on.
Let's get to the air lock
and get out of here.
That voice...
Purging now!
Come on, you apes.
You wanna live forever?
Kill them all!
She still has the ship.
Ice, you guard the captain.
The rest of you
are coming with me.
We're gonna kill the queen
and take back the ship.
Good luck.
Don't worry.
You'll see your kids soon.
But those bugs?
We're taking their mama down.
MAN 1: Holy shit!
MAN 2: Take evasive action!
MAN 3:
Incoming. Run and gun!
HERO:
Listen.
BUGSPRAY:
It's the engine.
Mech, still have explosives?
MECH:
Some C4.
BUGSPRAY:
Trig. No.
Trig.
Trig!
No.
Ambush.
Go, sir. I'll hold them off
for as long as I can.
Four-forty-one,
Damn.
What the hell?
This is what
I've been working on.
MAN :
T-minus 60 till launch.
Starting ﬁnal countdown.
Fifty-six, 55,
RICO:
Carmen, get down!
Johnny?
Are there any other survivors?
ICE BLONDE: Four more.
Heading to kill the queen.
And...
Jenkins?
You're still alive?
I can't die yet.
Not until we win this war at least.
So, by controlling
the bugs, you...
I can bring us one step closer
to winning the war.
And I can get you close enough
to kill the queen.
Then let's get moving.
QUEEN :
Let's negotiate.
HERO:
Daugherty?
Surrender Jenkins to us
and we will let you live.
They fear me.
Maybe they just think
you're an asshole.
Fuck off.
Then, you die!
These are the last ones
I can control directly for now.
If I could have finished my research--
HERO: Then finish it.
So we can end this.
Run.
What?
I said run!
MAN :
Three.
Two. One.
Launch.
BUGSPRAY:
Four-fifty-four, 455,
RICO:
Carl!
JENKINS:
Johnny Rico.
I should leave your ass here
to get nuked.
What do you mean "nuked"?
Let's go.
IBANEZ:
Johnny, the landing ship is here.
I'm coming.
WOMAN :
We lost contact
with the landing ship.
MAN:
T-minus-15 until impact.
Where's the ship?
No.
They took out the nuke.
She's won.
I still have one.
One what?
The shuttle I used to evacuate
from Fort Casey.
Heh. Then let's use it.
She'll never let us leave.
ICE BLONDE:
You son of a bitch.
RATZASS:
Aw. Now that's not nice.
Tell them.
I set explosives on the main engine.
What?
HERO :
Mech, still have explosives?
MECH: Some C4.
HERO: Good.
If we put the C4
in the main engine,
we can blow up the ship
and the queen with it.
Whoa.
We might not make it out
in time.
At least they won't.
Okay.
Then do it.
Ratzass, watch his back.
RATZASS: Yes, sir.
RATZASS:
So the extraction team's
been wiped out?
Just 10 minutes left.
Johnny, what are you doing?
Get to the shuttle.
Johnny!
Let's go.
Follow me.
Shit. Unh.
Are you Varro?
Yes, sir.
Where's Jenkins?
He's safe.
Varro!
Unh!
Good.
Make sure he keeps
everybody else that way.
He did it.
MECH:
Fifty-nine seconds.
Where's Johnny?
Captain, take us home.
Aye, aye, sir.
Are you gonna do it
or what?
Hm.
Three. Two.
One, boom.
I thought the good guys
and the hot girls
always survived
in the end.
No.
Not all of them.
Here's to the dead.
ALL:
And to the next man to die.
I hope you feel better.
Do you realize that
you not only destroyed my ship
and killed my crew,
but you also put the entire planet
at risk for infestation.
My apologies for your loss.
But my research is going to save
an entire galaxy.
Just like I saved you.
It was you.
You told me how to find Hero.
Well, that's classified.
See, nothing can stop us when
the three of us are working together.
Are we, Carl?
Pardon?
Are we? Working together?
Cheer up, Johnny.
You're a hero.
No.
No, I'm not.
But I met one.
"ANOTHER PERFECT DAY"
