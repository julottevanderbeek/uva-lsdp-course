-
Ah!
Quickly!
-
-
It's the Silk Road Protection Squad.
Stop fighting!
Brother, stop fighting!
Fight!
We'll handle this.
Brother, stop fighting.
I beg you.
My Hun brothers, I come in peace!
What does this have to do with
the Silk Road Protection Squad?
Our mission has always been
to turn foes into friends
and to attain peace for all races.
Whatever our friends
on the Silk Road need,
it's our responsibility to help.
Survival of the fittest
is the only truth on the Silk Road.
You want to control all 36 nations here
with your pathetic little band?
Anyway, he already lost.
He called me a savage!
Success doesn't depend
on how many you are,
but on how determined you are.
Woman: Let go.
Let go!
Huns!
My lady!
My lady!
I'm sorry, that wasn't intentional.
Woman: Get your sword out.
We'll follow the code.
The Protection Squad
follows the laws of our country.
We don't fight.
- Come here!
- No!
My lady!
Huo An:
Lady Cold Moon!
I didn't mean to remove your veil.
You dropped it yourself.
I know.
It was fate.
Actually, I'm here because...
Drink.
I'm ready.
I just wanted to return your veil.
I didn't see anything.
Nothing happened between us.
Stop laughing!
We haven't been home
in a long time. Let's go!
THE LITTLE SCHOOL
Wind and sand,
please send him back
Tell him I really miss him
Wind and sand, please promise me
He will come home
For the past few months,
I've been giving my wages
to my injured brothers.
I know.
You take such good care of your men.
We'll manage.
I know people laugh at you
for marrying a Huns man.
There you go again.
I love you because we're the same.
We believe in equality for all races.
You preach peace among
the different races on the Silk Road,
and I teach peace to children
from different tribes at school.
We're bound to succeed.
- Captain!
- Yin Po.
The Protection Squad is in trouble.
The Prefecture Chief's army
found four boxes of gold coins
outside the border.
There's a customs clearance
document inside.
Signed by who?
The Protection Squad.
Men: Captain.
Lieutenant.
What crime have we committed?
Why have you locked up my men?
The Protection Squad is under
the Prefecture Chief's jurisdiction.
Don't move!
This has nothing to do with them.
Take me.
By order of the Prefecture Chief,
Huo An and his Protection Squad
are under arrest for gold smuggling.
They will be sent to Wild Geese Gate
tomorrow morning to rebuild the city.
Man: What a crook.
Sending us to the border
so they can blame
the smuggled gold on us.
We've been exiled!
Wild Geese Gate is for prisoners
serving life sentences.
Once you go in, there's no way out.
This is so unfair.
What are you going to do about it?
Look, brothers.
We were once rescued by General Huo
from the Wild Geese Gate.
We should take this opportunity
to pay our respects to him.
Right.
-  Move!
-
- Keep moving!
- Move! Next!
HAN DYNASTY
GENERAL HUO QUBING'S SHRINE
One! Two!
Higher!
Quick. Help the injured!
What an idiot!
Captain, are you all right?
I'm fine.
Help them!
Help them.
It's all their fault! Get them!
Stop!
Come on! Fight!
What are you doing?
Stop!
Stop fighting!
Stop fighting!
Stop!
Guards: Stop!
Everyone stop fighting!
Get back to work!
Stop now!
Protection Squad, come here.
I don't care
about the Protection Squad.
This is the Wild Geese Gate.
Huo An,
under the Prefecture Chief's orders,
we have to finish rebuilding the city,
so you bunch of losers need to hurry up.
Come back here!
I'm not finished with you!
Legion!
We stop!
What do you think, General?
What is our current condition?
Close to 800 soldiers.
Three thousands bows
and crossbows altogether.
- Horses are thirsty and near exhaustion.
- Yes.
If we're gonna have a chance, we need
to take them as soon as possible.
Lucius. Lucius.
- Lucius.
- Yes, I'm here.
Falco says that
you are going to take the city.
Yes, but their captain is very weak,
and he doesn't look too bright,
so it won't take long.
Let's have a drink.
I'll wait for your good news
when you return.
We're at a new city, place to rest.
Intruders.
Listen to me if you want to live.
This way.
Sound the drums!
Halt!
I'm Lucius, Commanding General
Black Eagle Corps, Roman Empire.
Huo An.
General, is there any way no fight?
No. Go there.
No.
General Lucius is fighting
like a real demigod today.
I don't think there's a man alive that
could stand against our mighty general.
Look!
Sandstorm!
Look out! Sandstorm!
It's a sandstorm!
General!
Hey, listen to me.
Hey! Hey, stop!
- What?
- Stop! Listen!
Sandstorm coming.
Stop fighting.
Drop your weapon.
I'll let you in.
Or we bury here together.
The boy, too.
We need food and water for my men.
Medicine for a child.
And I need a place to think.
Lucius!
- Lucius.
- Here. Here.
I'm here.
Did you win the battle
against the Chinese warrior?
He won.
Yes! I knew you'd win.
Because you said
the Chinese captain was terrible,
and he even looked stupid.
-
-
Go! Go!
- You drink?
- Of course.
You ever meet a soldier
who doesn't drink?
Strong.
Yes, it's lovely.
Where you go tomorrow?
This is a question
I've been thinking about constantly.
In Rome,
we are trained to obey, to serve,
since we are very young.
When you finally get the opportunity
to chose your own path,
you realize there's nowhere to go.
Do Chinese soldiers feel the same way?
- No, we're different.
- Why?
You train kill people.
We train to save people.
I make Silk Road peace.
Peace is a dream.
I just wanna look at it.
I've never seen a Chinese sword.
What's the Chinese word for revenge?
What?
Someone hurts you or your family,
you kill them. Revenge.
- Vengeance is...
- Vengeance. Fùchóu.
Fùchóu.
Why you want fùchóu?
This is not your business.
Anything happen in Silk Road
is my business.
Fùchóu makes more hate.
Today, we meet. We are friend.
I want to help you.
When we leave tomorrow,
I may never see you again.
You make a friend today.
You lose one tomorrow.
Is it worth it?
Soldier:
Huo An!
We're doomed!
I just got the order
from the Prefecture Chief.
We have to finish restoring
Wild Geese Gate in 15 days.
Otherwise we're all going
to be executed.
Even if everyone works at full speed,
it would still take half a year
to complete.
Aren't you close to the 36 nations?
Please help me recruit more people.
This one's always upset.
We can rebuild the city,
and within 15 days.
They say
they can complete it within 15 days.
It'll take a long time
to gather the stones
and even longer to transport them.
That's a lot of big stone.
Difficult to move up.
You have plenty of gravel
outside the city.
Gravel. Do you understand?
Oh.
He said there are
a lot of small stones outside the city.
How do you build a city wall
with gravel?
Huo An, listen to me.
Trusting them is a mistake.
- He trusts you.
- Lucius: Thank you.
You must promise me one thing in return.
Find men to guide my deputies
to the Parthian Empire.
Okay, look.
We're here,
and the Parthian Empire is here.
Soldiers:
Hya! Hya! Hya! Hya!
Hya!
Fifteen days. Is it possible?
Hey! Stop it!
-
- Man: Stop it!
Good. Go.
Go!
See? Much easier.
Slow down, one at a time.
Take it and move on.
Everything's on schedule
Pull!
Move off to the left!
Lower. A bit more. That's it.
Tell me, what kind of city is this?
From where you're standing now, you
can see the entire, famous Silk Road,
that great artery of trade and culture
that connects the West
to the great kingdoms of the East.
When the sun sets,
the entire Silk Road, even
the city walls, become very, very warm.
I want to touch the city wall.
I can see it.
I can see them all.
I can see our own city gate.
And the place you taught me
how to use a sword.
Hey!
Let's go.
Training.
Positions!
Nicely done.
Yah!
Hey!
Thank you for the match.
That was a great fight!
Wait. Check again.
My brothers on the Silk Road,
let's make our own flags.
Once the city is restored,
we will raise them up together.
Good.
What are you drawing?
Falco:
Excellent, Young Master.
We need to prepare
for the flag ceremony quickly.
Come on!
Give all my liquor to our brothers!
Drink!
You like their music?
Another glass of wine for courage
In a world of chaos and conflict
No matter how big the obstacle
I swear to turn turmoil into peace
To turn foes into friends
There's no need for weapons
We'll move forward hand in hand
May wars forever end
May wars forever end
I wanna sing! I wanna sing!
Shh!
Shh, shh.
Firmly I pledge
My loyalty to thee
Land of my forefathers
Forever brimming with glory
A land of beauty
Home of the courageous
Our eternal Rome
The might of enemy ships
Threatens us in vain
It is a hopeless quest
Turn away from deceit
And sweet delusions
For the trumpets of war
Will call our legions soon
And across the fatherland
A victory song will ring
And across the fatherland
Our song will resonate
A time of joy and pride
For eternal Rome
Lucius: I served under
Consul Marcus Licinius Crassus Dives.
He moved his troops
to the Parthian Empire,
formed an alliance with the Queen,
who is the sister of our Lady Crassus.
Consul Marcus's elder son, Tiberius,
is a vicious and treacherous man.
The Consul was planning on naming
his youngest son Publius
to be his heir and successor.
He entrusted me to keep the child alive.
The young lord started having
problems with his eyes.
The Parthian queen kindly sent medicine
to heal his vision.
Tiberius laced it with poison,
blinding his brother
so he could never become Consul.
He then killed his father.
I had no choice
but to take my soldiers and the child,
become a fugitive.
Until I reached the Wild Geese Gate...
I've been a man without a country,
marked for death.
The deputy I sent to the Parthian Empire
is meant to restore the peace treaty
and to prove Tiberius's
vicious intentions.
I'm orphan.
Hun raids.
My parents killed by enemy.
Me and my sister run away.
-
- And she cried.
I used my hand
cover her mouth.
She die.
General Huo save my life.
He said, "War destroy family.
"Only peace can save Silk Road."
We are same.
Soldier: General!
Dessamiss has returned.
Ah!
- We will meet him.
- Black Eagles: Yes, General!
- Lucius, no.
- Huo An.
If you stand with us,
you will be butchered.
The city we built is a dream.
It only lasts 15 days.
I cannot be further in your debt.
Think, if Tiberius want to catch you,
why he need 100,000 men?
He can take over the entire Silk Road,
even China.
I think Tiberius working with the Chief.
It's our duty to protect Silk Road.
I can borrow a soldier
from my friend Yin Po.
Hopefully, we can stop them.
Hya!
Hya, Hya!
Publius: Captain Huo?
Falco?
Young Master.
On behalf of the Roman Empire,
I commission you
for centurion of the legion.
-
- What crime have I committed?
Huo An is a traitor and all his family
members are to be executed.
- How can you hit little children?
- Shut up!
Let me go!
Don't push me!
Get the kids!
- Children, get out of here!
- Go!
Batu, go!
Go!
Thank you for rescuing us.
What's your name?
I am Moon, Huo An's wife.
- It's not true.
- Duck!
Duck!
- Duck.
- Don't move!
Hurry, take the kids
to the second floor.
Don't be scared!
Go to the second floor!
- Hurry, go to the second floor.
- Quickly!
Send the kids down.
Quick! Quick!
-
-
- Don't be afraid.
- Book.
Oh!
My books.
Come, quickly!
Help me. Together.
Hurry. Go! Hurry, go!
Yes! Children, hurry, let's go!
No. This way, quick.
After them!
Go!
Hurry up!
Go!
- Get the kids out of here.
- I will.
- Listen to your teacher.
- Yes!
Man: Ah!
Sun! Thank you.
I'm just here for my sister. Hurry!
My books.
Look out!
Xiuqing!
- Teacher!
- Don't be afraid, Alijiang.
Teacher! Teacher!
- Go!
- Go!
All of you, come here.
Go!
Sun!
Go! Go!
General Lucius!
General Lucius,
reinforcements are here.
General Lucius.
Where is Huo An?
- Lucius!
- General!
-  Capture them alive.
- Men: Yes!
Lucius!
- Publius: Lucius!
-
Lucius!
Lucius, don't worry about me!
Go! Leave! Go!
Go!
I order you to go!
Go! Please go!
Welcome home.
So nice to have you
hanging around again.
Everyone in Rome,
including my father,
thought you were the finest warrior
in the Empire.
No, no.
I think of you more as a chess piece.
Think about it, Lucius.
If I hadn't purposely let you escape...
Purposely.
Do you really think you and Publius
would get this far?
Who could blame me for pursuing you?
I mean,
thank you for the perfect excuse
to bring my troops here.
I had already plotted this
with Huo's subordinate, Yin Po.
Yin Po gave me
the customs clearance document
and the Commander's seal.
As soon as my army settles in
at the borders,
the entire Silk Road region
belongs to the Roman Empire.
Spare the child.
He's no further threat
to your ambitions.
Show mercy.
Let me tell you.
No one felt the pain
more than I did
when I had to blind my own brother.
I beg of you.
Spare him.
He's committed no crime.
Of course he's committed a crime!
His crime...
His crime...
is that he took the place in your heart
that belonged to me.
You will never
hurt my young master ever again!
Falco will take you home.
Don't be afraid.
It's all right.
With my brother dead,
there really is no more cause
for conflict between you and I.
I will tell you a secret.
Lately...
When I look at my reflection...
I see you.
Ah!
Right.
It does get boring
when everything is so predictable.
Captain.
We fell for Yin Po's trap.
I'm sorry.
Go on.
Captain,
something happened
before you returned this morning.
Our great General Tiberius
has enacted a plan
to unify the Silk Road.
Tiberius:
I already asked him to acquiesce.
He said no.
All of the 36 nations have acquiesced.
You are the last.
We need you to do one thing.
What did they want you to do?
They want us
to give them Captain Huo.
What did you say?
Huo An,
this was never our business to start
with. Why should we get involved?
Captain Huo!
We are not as heroic as you are.
How do you expect us
to protect this place
when we can't even protect ourselves?
The Romans are right.
We all have families.
This way we can just take the gold
and go home.
Huo An, if you don't give yourself up,
we'll all die because of you.
We've been slaves all our lives.
This time we should have the right
to make our own decision.
Give yourself up!
Huo An,
are these people
worth it?
We should leave.
They need me now more than ever.
General Huo once said,
"A person who only laments the past
is a coward,
"whereas a person who can
change the future is a true hero."
Nonetheless, I have to admit
that the fate of the Silk Road can't be
changed by the Protection Squad alone.
Still, I'm truly thankful.
I thank you all
for joining me in rebuilding this city.
Together we proved
that harmony between the races
can be achieved.
During that precious time,
it felt as though
we were giving birth
to a newborn child of hope.
But his life
has been cut so short
that I won't have the chance
to see him grow up.
My brothers on the Silk Road,
I have already given my all.
People are rarely satisfied
with the truth.
If I can satisfy you by giving my life,
I will die with no regrets.
But I do have one last request.
Please raise the flags
that we made together.
Raise them for me,
so I can take one last look
at our child.
I will be forever indebted to you.
I promise to repay you in my next life.
Look at me, the mighty Rat,
the big hero.
What am I going to do with these coins,
buy a coffin?
I'll kill whoever dares
to invade Wild Geese Gate.
I'll fight!
-
- To my last breath.
Huo An! It's Huo An! It's Huo An!
Well, I'm not sure why, but I've always
liked those who hated me.
Now, Huo An,
pledge your allegiance to me,
and I will let you live.
How can you be so blind?
Dare to speak about truth?
I am Huo An,
work so hard in the Silk Road.
I am the one who should be a chief.
What are you doing? Get back here.
How can you give
for Yin Po the chief position?
You think he will hand over
the border to you
just so he can be a chief?
So you're saying
there's a problem with Yin Po?
General, Yin Po will arrive soon.
How many men is he bringing with him?
At least 10,000 soldiers.
- Man: And weapons?
- Scout: All fully-armed.
Is something wrong?
Ready.
On his right, can you see the keys?
Yes, I'm going to get them now.
Get in there. Get in!
I'll let you know when it's unlocked.
Don't worry, I'll help them.
Gold, give us. Go home.
How can you not live up to your word?
Move!
I got the key.
You also got caught.
How will you help the others?
General Tiberius.
Yin Po.
I have completed
all of your instructions.
As long as you give me
the Prefecture Chief's seal,
in exchange, I will surrender
the Commander's Seal.
How well do you know Huo An?
Understand?
-  Everyone understand?
- All: Mm-hm.
Now.
- Hey!
- Stop!
Go!
Hey, Huo An, give us the key!
Here!
They're coming! Faster!
Take care of yourself!
Now! Kill them all!
Shoot.
Who shot that arrow?
Ready arms!
Yes, General.
Sound the attack!
Kill them!
We have
no reason to initiate this fight.
Kill him,
and the Prefecture Chief title
belongs to you.
Ma Chuang.
Good throw.
Ah!
Ah!
General, the jail has been breached.
Huo An.
Well, send more people there.
Soldier: Open the gate!
Huo An, is that you?
Yes.
Huo An.
Huo An.
It's you.
You have no business
in Roman family quarrels.
This is not your business.
It's my duty.
Listen to me.
Huo An!
Listen to me. Listen.
The city we built,
a city without fear,
terror, humiliation.
When they raze that city,
rebuild it.
Whoever shares that city with me
is forever my friend.
Huo An.
Huo An.
First Centurion,
I entrust my troops to you.
Go, or they will die here with you.
Go! Now!
Huo An.
Take me home.
We shall meet again.
Here they come!
Get ready!
Archers!
- Get back!
- Pull back!
- Come on!
- Pull it back! Pull it back!
Get back! Come on! Come on!
Stone!
Stones!
Grab the stones!
Yeah!
Hurry!
Forward!
Yeah!
Go!
Go!
- Go!
- Go!
Get out of here!
Soldiers, let's leave!
Hurry, move.
They're coming! Positions!
To the right! Hold the line!
Company hold!
Statius, we are all Romans.
Surrender!
A true Roman never surrenders!
To arms!
Form ranks!
Form ranks! Form ranks!
- Use the shield. Slide the rock.
- Yes, sir!
Slide the rock!
Push!
Ah!
Follow me! Quick!
Go! Go! Go!
- Take the hill!
- The hill!
The hill!
General, Huo An.
My god, they're like locusts!
We're trapped!
No, brother, we die together!
- Die together!
-
Engage!
Brothers, charge!
Attack!
Moon, go rescue Huo An!
Awake!
Awake!
Go!
Yah!
Kill them!
Fight them!
About face!
Yeah!
Move down!
Move down!
Engage!
Ah!
Ah!
Oh!
Captain!
Captain!
Ah!
Ah, ah!
Sun.
Parthians.
Disengage the army.
Tiberius,
the criminal who killed Crassus
and blinded Publius,
stands here before you.
This is an outrage!
A conspiracy!
Consul Crassus and I
signed this peace treaty
so as to guarantee
the safety of your brother.
Because your father knew
of your evil plan.
So let me ask you
on behalf of your father and brother,
what was on your mind
when you ended their lives?
Man:
It's never too late to turn back.
Give me your sword.
What?
A real hero remains accountable
until the end.
Right.
I did it.
Let's resolve this.
If I made a mistake
in this game of chess,
it'd be that I looked down upon you.
No.
You looked down on human.
Why are you so eager to end your story?
Not for me. For my friend.
Lucius.
What a good friend you are!
But this is a Roman matter!
You have no right
to challenge me to a duel.
Master Publius made Huo An
as a Roman warrior!
General Lucius placed us
under his command!
Soldier:
He's one of us now!
Let's resolve this.
You and I.
Well, then,
we shall give you a proper burial.
Hm.
Huo An!
Come on!
You're wearing
the headband of a dead man.
I'd say that's a bad omen.
God will bless us all.
All: Huo An!
Huo An!
The show is over!
Don't worry.
You'll be with him soon enough.
Huo An!
Ah!
Ah!
Power is a conceit
which reveals our limitations.
Tiberius: A real hero
remains accountable
till the end.
Land of my forefathers
Forever brimming with glory
A land of beauty
Home of the courageous
Our eternal Rome
The might of enemy ships
Threatens us in vain
It is a hopeless quest
It is a hopeless quest
It is a hopeless quest
Soldiers, salute!
TURN FOES INTO FRIENDS
For the trumpets of war
Will call our legions soon
And across the fatherland
A victory song will ring
And across the fatherland
Our song will resonate
A time of joy and pride
For eternal Rome
You make a friend today.
You lose one tomorrow.
Is it worth it?
