MAN: Whoa!
MAN #2: Take it.
MAN #3: I'll tell you what,
we're having an earth--
MAN #4: Start talking.
MALE NEWSCASTER: Uh, I'm not
sure if we're even on the air.
Uh, this is a... a series of explosions--
BRITISH FEMALE NEWSCASTER:
We're now being told
this is a major incident.
The emergency is a major incident.
BRITISH MALE NEWSCASTER:
...reported bright lights and an orange glow...
BRITISH FEMALE NEWSCASTER #2: That
was the moment the meteor hit.
BRITISH MALE NEWSCASTER #3: It does
now appear to be a major attack.
WOMAN: Since they landed
outside Hamburg five years ago,
they have steadily advanced across Europe.
We've suffered millions of casualties, and yet...
WOMAN #2: The evacuation of key
government officials continuing.
BRITISH MALE NEWSCASTER #3:
...has been able to stop their advance.
MALE NEWSCASTER: In human
costs, the Europeans have paid
the highest price.
...to mimic and even
anticipate our actions.
BRIGHAM: If we do not
defeat them in France,
we'll be fighting them in the streets of London,
then New York, then Tokyo.
All of humanity's at stake.
MALE NEWSCASTER: After five
years, we finally have a victory.
FEMALE NEWSCASTER: These
pictures are just in from Verdun.
MALE NEWSCASTER #2:
...striking things about the quick coalition victory
was how low casualties were and how little damage...
MAN: We have seen a
stunning victory here today.
The united defense force has retaken Verdun.
How do you convince people that this is a fight
that can be won?
This is an alien invasion in a global war.
With the new jacket technology
and limited amount of training,
we've been able to
create super-soldiers.
Look at Rita Vrataski, the angel of Verdun.
WOMAN: They're calling
her the angel of Verdun.
She is seen as the new hope for this war.
It's extraordinary.
With the new jacket technology and limited training,
Rita Vrataski was able to kill
hundreds of mimics on only her first day in combat.
WOMAN #2:
...a revolutionary new technology...
ANNOUNCER: The only
thing missing is you.
BRITISH FEMALE NEWSCASTER: She's
killed hundreds of mimics.
She was able to kill hundreds of mimics
on only her first day in combat.
Imagine an army of Rita Vrataskis.
We're managing to hold them back at the English channel,
but for how long?
MALE NEWSCASTER: This
is dangerous talk
and it's easy to understand why people are suspicious...
BRITISH MALE NEWSCASTER:
Over seventy nations
have joined the united defense force,
which hopes to push them back once and for all.
We've got 'em contained.
And with this new technology, we're gonna defeat 'em.
Operation downfall is going to be the largest
mechanized invasion in the history of mankind.
We will be victorious.
We fight. That's what we do.
Major William Cage, united states military media.
Welcome to London, Major.
The General will see you now.
Thank you.
BRIGHAM: Operation downfall.
The entire might of the UDF, invading from France,
the Mediterranean, Scandinavia,
relieving pressure on the eastern front,
allowing the Russians and Chinese to push the enemy back.
We all meet in the middle,
exterminating this mimic scourge along the way.
A lot of good soldiers are gonna die tomorrow, Major.
You know, when the smoke clears
and the body bags start coming home,
people tend to look for someone to blame,
someone like me.
Ideally, I'd prefer a different scenario.
Please.
A best-selling memoir, perhaps.
Maybe a career in politics?
Off the top of my head,
I would go with the-the
sense of manifest destiny.
Rags to riches. Rapid
rise through the ranks.
Uh, born to deliver us.
And the people... well, they love that sort of thing.
You misunderstand, Major.
I didn't ask you here to sell me.
I want you to sell the invasion.
Okay.
You ship out for the coast in one hour.
Your camera crew is standing by.
You'll be on the beach with the first wave.
Uh, I'm sorry,
the f-first wave?
The beach? You mean... the front?
France.
Satellites show minimal enemy movement on the coast.
Little resistance.
A little excitement,
something to tell your grandchildren.
While I appreciate...
The confidence, General,
that's... I'm do-- I do this to avoid doing that.
It's...
I-- I-- I was in
ROTC in college.
Uh, the war broke out,
I lost my advertising firm and here I am.
You know, I do what I do,
and you-you do what you do.
But...
I'm not a... soldier, really.
No, of course you're not.
That's why I'm embedding you
with several hundred thousand men and women who are.
While it is an honor, General,
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline.
Can't stand the sight of blood.
Not so much as a paper cut.
Uh, but, uh, si-sitting
here thinking about this,
uh-uh-uh, a couple
of names come to mind
that I feel I could
recommend to you. It's--
it's not an offer, Major.
It's an order.
General, I am an officer in the United States military.
You don't even have the authority.
I have spoken to your C.O.
You are now under my command.
You will retain your present rank, of course.
My secretary has all the details.
Do a good job, Major.
Good luck. You are dismissed.
General?
I just inspired millions of people...
To join your army.
And when the body bags come home,
and they're looking for someone to blame...
How hard do you think it would be
for me to convince people to blame you?
I'd imagine that the General would prefer to avoid that.
Are you blackmailing me, Major?
I would prefer...
Not to be filming acts of heroism and valor
on that beach tomorrow.
You won't be.
I'm glad we could, uh, work this out.
Now if you'll excuse
me, General, I--
Thank you.
Arrest this man.
What?
Hey! Hey!
Stop right there!
Hey! Stop!
Hold it!
MAN: Left flank, march!
MAN: About-turn!
WOMAN:
MAN: Get yourselves in line!
On your feet, maggot!
That is no way to address an officer,
It's how I address a
slack-jawed recruit
right before I bust his hole with my boot heel, maggot.
FARELL: Hold up
there, Sergeant.
Can I help you, sir?
Where the hell am I, Sergeant?
Forward operating base Heathrow.
You just came in with the fresh recruits.
Do I strike you as a fresh recruit?
No, sir, you do not.
My name is Major William Cage.
I'm an American officer.
Officer?
This is processing.
There's no officers down here.
I got this, Sergeant.
How the hell
did you end up in processing?
What was it?
Poker night? Bachelor party?
If it's all the same to you, Sergeant,
I'd like to explain that
to my commanding officer in Washington,
so if you'll just take
me to a phone, I can--
haven't you heard?
We're t-minus-haul-ass-h-hour.
We're fixing to invade France.
This whole F.O.B.'S
on lockdown.
No calls. In or out.
Your name is Farell.
That's right.
Master Sergeant Farell.
Master Sergeant Farell, you're an American.
No, sir. I'm from Kentucky.
Okay. Well, look at me.
And look at where I am. Gsh personnel,
report for h.U.D. Calibration.
I've been railroaded.
It's obvious I don't belong here.
So please, Sergeant,
there has to be a way I can make a phone call.
I'll get you sorted out, sir.
Thank you.
Right this way.
Where you from in Kentucky, Sergeant?
Little town called science hill.
Heard of it?
I have now.
How 'bout you? Where you from?
Cranbury, New Jersey.
They grow a lot of Cranberries there, do they?
Tomatoes. Best you ever had.
Why they call it cranberry, then?
Why they call it science hill?
Never asked. Don't care.
After you.
MAN:
please report to sector five
for jacket H.U.D. Calibration.
You're not taking me to a phone, are you, Sergeant?
No, I am not.
Seems about the only honest thing you said to me
so far is your name.
It says here you're a deserter.
It says here you were caught impersonating an officer.
It says here you'd likely try to make an outside call,
even compromise security of this operation.
Anything to get out of combat duty tomorrow.
But that's not gonna happen.
Ever... Private Cage.
Got a rhythm and it's all you need
so, everybody come and rock your thing
take you down to the early days
when the champagne flow like a river stream, yeah
rumor is a terrible thing.
Come nightfall, these men will
all reach the same conclusion.
That you're a coward and a liar,
putting your life above theirs.
The good news is there's hope for you, Private.
Hope in the form of glorious combat.
Battle is the great redeemer.
The fiery crucible in which the
only true heroes are forged.
The one place where all men truly share the same rank,
regardless of what kind of parasitic scum
they were going in.
Hey, yo!
Squad!
This here is Private Cage.
Private Cage, J squad.
Isn't that an officer's uniform?
Those sure ain't officer cufflinks.
I see everyone is havin' a productive mornin'.
You know, it gives me a swell of pride
knowin' soldiers of your...
Caliber will be leadin' the charge tomorrow.
Tip of the spear.
Edge of the knife.
Crack of my... ass.
Oh, shit.
Private Kimmel,
what is my view of gamblin' in the barracks?
You dislike it, Sergeant Farell.
Nance, why do I dislike it?
'Cause it entertains the notion
that our fate is in hands other than our own.
And what is my definitive position
on the concept of fate, chorus?
TOGETHER: Through
readiness and discipline,
we are masters of our fate.
You might call that notion ironic.
But, trust me, you'll come around.
Private Cage is a deserter.
I'm making you all personally
responsible for his deliverance.
He will be combat ready at
oh-six-hundred tomorrow.
Combat ready?
Private Cage is under the delusion
he does not belong here.
We must dissuade him of this delusion.
If he tries to run,
feel free to dissuade him until he can't piss standing up.
No, no. Sergeant, you
have to listen to me.
I will never be combat ready.
I envy you, Cage.
Tomorrow morning, you will be baptized.
Born again.
P.T.! Ten minutes!
So, everybody come along with me
go down the river and wash your feet, now
to where the people live a life that's sweet
you're not in uniform,
Yeah
MAN: Could all
combat-ready squadrons...
It's a new day, people.
Destiny calls.
The world expects only one thing
FROM US: That we will win.
SKINNER: Where's the
claymores, please?
Where's my babies?
My arms are growing tired from trying to stay afloat
come on, Kimmel, let's have it!
Oh, for Chris sake, Kimmel.
I gotta be free, man!
All right, man, let's get this show on the road.
I gotta suit up.
What's that noise? That--
FORD: Let's go.
Listen, man, I've never been in one of these.
Yeah, well, I've never been with
two girls at the same time before.
But you can bet when that day comes,
I'll make it work.
Hey, hey, hey. Yeah, Kimmel...
It's Griff.
Griff. Griff. You bet.
Just think about this, man.
I could hurt somebody with...
Not with the safety on, you won't.
SKINNER: Get a shift on, mate.
Come on!
BUT-- NANCE: You ready?
FORD: Aw, that's what's up.
Where is the safety?
Exactly.
TAKEDA: It's time.
Bloody hell, it's
the full metal b--!
Move!
Griff. Sarge?
Take care of Private Cage.
What, all day?
Somethin' tells me it won't be nearly that long.
Let's go!
Griff! Cage!
Cage! Cage!
FARELL: We lost Germany.
We lost France.
If we lose today,
we won't get to fight another.
I know the pressure on you is enormous.
Two minutes to drop.
It's all right to be scared.
Remember there's no courage without fear.
SKINNER: 'Ey!
Oi, mate!
I think there's something wrong with your suit.
Yeah. There's a dead guy in it.
Hey, watch your back out there... sir.
No one else will.
FARELL: One minute!
One minute to drop!
Hey!
Hey!
What?
How do I turn the safety off of my weapon?
What?!
How do I turn the
safety off--?!
Oh, my god!
FARELL: Get ready!
Thirty seconds to drop! Yeah!
On my mark!
Stand by to deploy!
Activate drop lines.
Remember--
FARELL: Drop!
Drop!
Drop! Drop!
Drop!
Go!
Go, let's go!
Come on!
Drop! Drop!
Cage! Drop or die!
KIMMEL: Yeah! Whoo!
We made it!
Thank god, we made it!
Yeah--!
WOMAN:
MAN: Let's move it!
WOMAN:
Someone help us out!
We need it now!
Ah!
What the--?!
Private Cage!
You goin' the wrong way.
You're gonna miss your moment.
What the hell?
They're not supposed to know we're even coming.
We walked into a slaughterhouse, man.
It's a slaughterhouse!
SKINNER: Pull yourself
together, Ford!
FARELL: On your feet, people!
Get in line!
Nance, get me a sit-rep.
Safety! Griff, Ford,
cover the flank!
My safety! My safety.
My safety.
How do I get my safety?
I'm waitin', Nance!
I got traces!
Five hundred meters and they're coming in fast!
Sumbitch.
Get outta the way!
Look alive if you wanna stay that way!
Firing positions!
Move!
Here they come.
Mean as hell and thick as grass.
Wait till they're right on us.
A few more seconds.
Hey! Hey!
Griff, fall back!
MAN: Left flank... march!
TOGETHER: Left, right, left!
On your feet, maggot!
WOMAN:
Get in line before I bust your
hole with my boot heel, maggot!
FARELL: Hold up
there, Sergeant.
Can I help you, sir?
Sergeant Farell.
Is it...?
That is my name.
I think I get it.
What was it? Poker night?
Bachelor party?
You know, I'm not sure.
It happens.
I'll get you sorted out, sir.
Let me take those for you.
What--? What day is it?
For you?
Judgment day.
The good news is there's hope for you, Private.
Hope in the form of glorious combat.
Battle is the great redeemer,
the fiery crucible in which
the only true heroes are fo--
--the only true heroes are forged.
Did you just interrupt me, Private?
Sarge, you're
You're-- you're
not gonna believe
what I'm about to tell you.
No, I'm not.
Now, where was I?
The fiery crucible...
The fiery crucible
in which the only true heroes are forged.
The one place where all men truly share the same rank,
regardless of what kind of parasitic scum
they were goin' in.
Squad!
Welcome to hell, homey.
This here is Private Cage.
Private Cage...
J squad.
Isn't that an officer's uniform?
They sure ain't officer cuff links.
You know, it gives me a swell of pride
knowing soldiers of your... caliber
will be leadin' the charge tomorrow.
Tip of the spear, edge of the knife,
crack of my ass.
Private Kimmel, what is my view
of gamblin' in the barracks?
KIMMEL: Dislike it,
Sergeant Farell.
Nance, why do I dislike it?
Because it entertains the notion
that our fate is in hands other than our own.
And what is my definitive position
on the concept of fate, chorus?
TOGETHER: Through
readiness and discipline,
we are masters of our fate.
You might call that notion ironic.
Trust me, you'll come around.
NANCE: Oh, for
Chris sake, kimmel.
KIMMEL: I gotta be free, man!
All right, man, let's get this show on the road.
I gotta suit up.
FORD: Let's go.
WOMAN:
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you, man?
Haven't you ever been in one of these before?
Maybe.
Do you know where the safety is?
I'm not sure.
Good.
FARELL: I know the pressure
on you is enormous.
Two minutes to drop.
It's all right to be scared.
Remember there's no courage without fear.
SKINNER: 'Ey! Oi, mate!
I think there's something wrong with your suit.
Yeah. There's a dead guy in it.
Yeah.
Hey, watch your back out there,
NANCE AND CAGE:
No one else will.
Jinx, bitch!
FARELL: On my mark!
Stand by to deploy!
Activate drop lines, thirty seconds.
REMEMBER: Hit the street-- hey!
Hey!
Go! Go!
Aah!
Woo-hoo! We made it!
Thank god, we made it!
Behind you!
Look out!
Incoming!
I'm hit. I'm hit.
How bad is it?
Is there--? Is there
a-a lot of blood?
You have a hole in your chest.
Really?
Yeah.
Did you just take my--
my battery-battery?
No, no, no, no.
Holy fu--!
MAN: Left, right, left.
On your feet, maggot!
Sergeant Farell!
Sergeant Farell. Can
I help you, sir?
My name is Major Bill Cage. I'm U.S.
army media relations.
I was not at a bachelor party or a poker game.
You have an order in your left pocket
that says I'm a deserter caught impersonating an officer.
But what it doesn't say
is that your-your name
is master Sergeant Farell from science hill, Kentucky.
And if you'll give me thirty seconds
to explain how I know that,
you may just save the lives of every soldier on this base.
You have to listen to me!
They know we're coming!
They're waiting for us!
I have been there!
I've seen it!
You're all doomed!
You're doomed!
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
This is J squad. Yes?
This is J squad, yes.
Not that I should know that, but okay.
Have any of you met me before?
Bitch, I don't know you.
Exactly! Yes! Thank you.
Your name is Nance.
You're Bibble.
Kibble-- Kimmel!
You fight balls out. Literally.
Ford. Skinner. Griff.
You're-- k-- he
doesn't talk much.
But there's a card game under the bed.
Thanks a lot, asshole.
Uh, Kimmel's working on a flush.
Uh, spades-- no, clubs.
And you're gonna make them eat those cards.
Am I right?
Now...
What I'm about to tell you sounds crazy.
It's true.
And you have to listen to me.
Your very lives depend on it.
FARELL: One minute!
The ship is gonna explode!
The ship is about to explode!
What?! What is he saying?!
Nance! What is he saying?
The ship is about to explode!
Hey! Anyone!
Ha!
On my mark! Stand by to deploy!
Activate drop lines. The
ship is about to explode!
Yeah! Whoo! We made it!
Thank god, we made it!
Sergeant:
...before I bust your hole with my boot heel!
Yeah! Whoo! We made it!
Thank god, we made it!
I'm sorry! I'm
trying to save you.
We're getting slaughtered.
You need to get us off this beach.
We have to go.
This drop ship is about to explode.
We have to go now.
Wait.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on! This ship
is going to explode!
What are you doing?!
Find me when you wake up.
What?!
Come find me when you wake--
On your feet, maggot!
Get in line before I bust your
hole with my boot heel, maggot!
Good news is there's hope for you, Private.
Battle is the great redeemer.
The fiery crucible in which the
only true heroes are forged.
The one place where all
men truly sh-- share the--
squad, this here is Private Cage.
Private Cage.
And you must be J squad.
It's good to meet you.
Isn't that an officer's uniform?
Those sure ain't officer's--
these sure ain't officer's cuff links.
Keys in the...
Left pocket probably.
Private Cage is a deserter.
I'm making you all personally responsible
for his deliverance.
He will be combat-ready by
oh-six-hundred tomorrow.
Private Cage is under the delusion
he does not belong here.
We must dissuade him of this delusion.
If he tries to run,
feel free to dissuade him
until-- oh, no, no, no.
I'm-- I'm not going
to run from you guys.
It's, uh-- not a chance.
Till he can't piss standin' up.
Thank you, Sergeant Farell.
What next? A little, uh, P.T.?
FARELL: P.T.! Ten minutes!
Left!
Left!
Left!
What are you?! Sound off!
TOGETHER: I'm a warrior!
What do warriors do?!
Kill!
What are you gonna do?!
Kill!
What are you gonna do?!
Kill!
FORD: It's gonna be my twentieth
battle tomorrow, man.
You haven't been in twenty battles, mate.
I have too. You're
gonna dump your load
the second we hit the beach tomorrow.
Why don't you two get yourselves a nice hot cup
of shut-the-hell-up!
Ha ha. You funny, girl.
But I bet you I set some kind of record tomorrow.
Fastest time runnin' backwards, Ford...
Slippin' in your own shit.
TOGETHER: Kill!
Knock off the grab-ass!
Grab this, Sarge!
Hold up!
Private, drop and give me...
Fifty, Sarge?!
That's right.
Fifty.
Platoon!
Drop and give me fifty!
Compliments of Private Cage.
Thank you, Sarge!
AND ONE! ALL: One!
And two! Two!
And three! Three!
Four!
Five! Six!
Seven!
Oh!
What the hell were you thinkin'?
There's hope for you, Private.
Hope in the form of glorious combat.
Battle is the great redeemer--
ALL: Two!
Three! Three!
Four! Four!
Five! Five!
Six!
Seven!
Eight!
Nine! Ten!
Eleven! Twelve!
Thirteen! Fourteen!
Excuse me. Sergeant Vrataski.
Excuse me!
Sergeant Vrataski!?
Excuse me!
Yes? Who said you
could talk to me?
Have I got something on my face, soldier?
You did. You did.
Tomorrow. At the beach.
Tomorrow. At the beach.
We meet.
You said to find you when I wake up.
You do know what's happening to me.
Come with me.
Now.
You don't talk to anyone about this but me.
'Cause the best case scenario
is you're gonna end up in a psych ward.
And the worst case, you'll get dissected for study.
Are we clear? Yes? Yes.
First time you died, what happened?
You killed a mimic? Yes.
Describe it.
Um... it was different.
It was, uh, bigger. Bluish.
And you got covered in its blood.
As a matter of fact, I did.
They know we're coming on the beach tomorrow.
It's a slaughter, isn't it?
How do you know this?
Could you just-- wait!
Wait. Wait.
Look, would you please just explain to me
what the hell is happening?
What happened to you happened to me.
I had it. I lost it. Okay?
I mean, that's great.
There's a cure.
How do I get rid of this?
First, I need your help.
Help with-- with what exactly?
Winning the war.
Let's go! Come on!
Rita, what is this? Rita?
What are you doing here?
You gotta give me some warning.
Who's this?
He's me. Before Verdun.
He's gonna help us.
What? You-you mean he's--
yes.
When did he die? Where?
On the beach. Tomorrow.
How many fingers am I holding up behind my back?
How should I know that?
Okay.
So...
This is the first time we've had this conversation.
You should try this on him.
What the hell is that?
It doesn't work.
Has he had any visions yet?
Visions of what?
Okay, so there's still time.
Yes. Time? Look.
I-- I'm sorry. Which is--?
Who is this?
Who are you?
I'm Dr. Carter.
Particle physics.
Advanced microbiology.
He's also the only other person
who'll believe what's happening to you.
No one understands mimic biology better than him.
He's a top analyst at Whitehall.
Well, I mean, I was until I met Rita
and now I'm just a--
a "mechanic with
psychiatric delusions."
Carter. Show him.
Yeah, right.
Right. Well, first of all...
You're not fighting an army.
You have to think of this as a single organism.
Now... these common drones,
they act like its claws.
And alphas, like the one that you killed,
are much more rare.
Yeah. They're like one in six
point one eight million,
by my guess. Yes.
They act as the enemy's--
they're-they're like its
central nervous system.
But this is the brain.
It controls them all.
And this is the Omega.
And the Omega has the ability to control time.
Whenever an Alpha is killed...
An automatic response is triggered.
The Omega starts the day over again.
But you see, this time it can remember
what's going to happen...
Just like you do.
I-I-it knows exactly what we're
gonna do before we're gonna do it.
And an enemy that knows the future can't lose.
It can't lose.
But if that's true,
how did you win at Verdun?
We were allowed to win.
This thing wants us to believe we can win.
It wants us to throw everything we have into the invasion.
Operation downfall isn't our endgame, it's the enemy's.
The thing you've got to understand is
this is a perfectly evolved,
world-conquering organism.
For all we know, there are thousands,
millions of those asteroids
floating around in the cosmos like a virus.
And they're just waiting
to crash-land into a world
with just the right conditions.
All they need is for the dominant life form
to attack and
And there'll be nothing to stop the mimics
from conquering the rest of the world.
Unless you change the outcome.
Me?
When you killed that Alpha,
you inadvertently entered the enemy's nervous system.
Cage.
You've seized control
of the Omega's ability to reset the day.
How's that even possible?
Perhaps this organism's only vulnerability,
I-its only vulnerability
is humanity.
Regardless of that, you control the power now.
Just as I did in verdun.
So resetting the day?
Okay.
How do I control it?
You have to die.
Every day.
Until the Omega's destroyed.
First of all...
This is a terrific presentation.
Terrific.
I know the General.
We should take this to him.
You just tell him everything you told me.
He will know what-- I went
to see the General, Cage.
Any number of times.
Psych ward. Dissection.
Remember?
What are you expecting from me?
Have you seen anything strange?
Is he shitting me?
Visions. Uh, visions.
Have you seen any visions like that?
The Omega senses when it's losing control of its power.
E-even now it's mentally
searching to find you.
RITA: When it's close
to finding you,
you will start having visions.
You'll start to see that.
Eh-- you'll even see where it is.
And you had these visions?
Yes.
But eventually you saw it.
I mean, you actually saw it.
Right?
Never in the flesh.
So this is all just some... theory.
You don't know if this thing even exists.
The visions showed me it was at Verdun.
I could see it. I--
I just... lost the power before I could get to it.
And by the time we took Verdun...
The Omega was gone.
Okay.
So all I have to do is wait to have these... visions,
and then tell you where this... Omega thing is.
No. Cage.
You're gonna get me there.
And I'm gonna kill it.
Get you there?
I'm not...
I'm not even trained for combat.
Are you all right, Cage?
I think I broke something.
What?
My back.
The only thing I can
feel are my-my lips.
Now listen carefully. This
is a very important rule.
This is the only rule.
You get injured on the field,
you better make sure you die.
Why?
Last time I was in combat, I was hit.
I was bleeding out.
Just not fast enough.
I woke up in a field hospital
with three pints of someone else's blood and I was out.
I lost the power.
Do you understand?
Think we better start over.
Don't you? What?
FARELL: No one knows what
happened to Private Cage!
Skinner, you dumb-ass. He
was right next to you.
You're tellin' me you don't know
where that slippery son of a bitch went?
No, Sarge!
All right.
Let's do another fifty, shall we?
And one!
No, wait! Wait.
My name is Bill Cage.
I-- we met on the beach.
We meet on the beach.
Tomorrow. I have what you had.
All right, let's go again.
You don't have time to think.
Remember.
It's not enough knowing where they're going to be.
You have to know how to kill them.
I just, oh-- hold on. Hold on.
Listen. Listen.
Okay.
Do it.
On your feet, maggot!
Stop! Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
Stop! Wait! Wait a second!
Wait a second. Wait a second.
You know, I've been thinking.
I mean, this thing's in my blood.
So maybe there's some way...
I can transfer it to you.
I've tried everything.
It doesn't work.
I mean, have you... you know...
Tried all-all the options.
Oh, you mean sex.
Yep. Tried it.
How many times?
All right.
Left, left! Left, left, le--
Keep your eyes open.
Again.
Again.
Again.
Again.
Just wait! Wait.
I think I'm okay.
On your feet, maggot!
Maggot! Maggot!
Now, I'm tryin' to be nice
to you, maggot! Now, move!
Are you okay, Cage?
Oh yeah, yeah! I'm good!
I'm good!
Your leg's broken.
No. I-- I can still feel my toes.
Oh, come on.
MAN: About face!
Rita. R-Rita. What is this?
What are you doing here?
Who-who's this guy?
He's me... before Verdun.
Before Verdun.
What-what do you mean? He's...?
Yes. Yes. When did he die?
Where? On the beach.
Tomorrow. I'm Bill Cage.
You're Dr. Carter.
We've had this conversation before.
You have two fingers behind your back.
I've had the visions.
I've seen the Omega.
Um.
It's... pretty much game over tomorrow.
So, can we move this along?
Okay.
Okay-- where?
There's a dam.
It's in the mountains.
I saw German writing.
RITA: Do you think you can
work out where that is?
W-well-- I mean, there
can't be too many places
that fit that description.
I'll see what I can do.
Training's over.
I'll see you tomorrow.
We don't even know where we're going.
We will soon enough.
In the meantime, you need to figure out
a way to get us off that beach.
What next? Where we going?
Which way? Focus. Which way?
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.
Okay. Oh, man!
How far did we make it?
You know, it's hard to say, really.
It's--
hold!
Hold!
Okay, go!
Son of a bitch!
I thought stepping left, ducking--
just for the record, stepping
left, ducking-- fine.
Stepping left, ducking
right-- stepping right.
And it was pretty specific.
Stepping left,
ducking right. Move on.
CAGE: Hold on!
NOW, REMEMBER:
Across the trench!
Twelve o'clock!
Then look to your right!
You're not being specific.
Do you understand?
I said-- you need to be specific.
Uh, okay. But-- look--
otherwise, I'm dead.
Just-- Rita.
Cage!
...paces up to the
top of the trench.
I'm gonna step left.
There's gonna be a mimic
there, which I'll kill--
...ship explosion.
I'm gonna run thirty paces northwest.
I'm gonna duck at the top of that trench
and then I'm gonna turn left.
Have I got something on my face?
No.
SKINNER: Cage!
We've been lookin' everywhere for you.
Cage!
Cage, we've been lookin'--
guys.
Guys. Can we... just...
Not do this today?
What are you talkin' about?
Farell almost strung us up by our bollocks
for losing track of you!
Okay... Skinner. Watch this.
Now I'm gonna close my eyes.
Ready? Yeah.
Stinking bastard.
I-I didn't mind the
extra push-ups.
MAN:
FARELL: It's a new day, people.
Destiny calls.
The world expects only one thing from us:
That we will win.
WOMAN:
...the current situation on the front line.
MAN:
It's about time
we showed those things what we're made of.
My father flew in the battle of Britain.
Three years before the yanks came into the war.
Couldn't be broken. Backbone.
MAN #2: My uncle George landed
on the beach at Normandy.
Yeah?
In their day, this war would have been over by now.
What do they want with us, anyway?
It's obvious, isn't it?
Minerals.
Minerals? Yeah, minerals.
Metals.
Oxygen, they want. Oxygen?
Think about it.
What difference does it make?
They're here. They're winning.
And whatever it is, they're gonna get it.
Shouldn't you be over there?
I've been over there.
More times than anybody.
As a matter of fact, I'm...
Usually long dead by now.
Coward!
What's going on?
The power's gone.
CARTER: I found the Omega.
I found it.
It has to be here.
Curnera dam, Germany.
This has got to be it.
It fits the description perfectly.
Yes, you found it.
Again.
What difference does it make?
'Cause we're never gonna get there.
No matter what we do...
No matter how carefully we plan,
we can't get off that beach.
You can do this. You can.
You keep coming here every day and I'll train you.
You already have.
I'm waitin', Nance!
Five hundred meters and closing fast!
What the--?!
WOMAN:
What's next?
Straight shot... up the hill.
Okay.
Hey, Sarge, the new guy, what's his name again?
CAGE: We'll need a vehicle
to get further inland.
RITA: And what's the problem?
The problem is the ambush waiting for us down there.
They kill us before we find a working car.
Okay. So, what's
the current plan?
The two cars we haven't tried yet.
The minivan... yep.
...and the green S.U.V. Okay.
So I'll head for the S.U.V.,
draw the mimics to me.
You go for the minivan.
You get it started, just go, take off.
Do not wait for me. Okay.
Whoa-- just...
Don't forget to disconnect the
caravan before you take off.
You are going to be in a hurry
and you don't want any dead weight.
Come on.
Come on, Cage!
WOMAN:
...on the front line.
And all are advised to...
I can't see.
...seek shelter as
a matter of urgency.
Can you?
It's good driving.
I forgot to unhook the trailer.
You don't talk much.
I'm not a fan.
Of talking?
Not a fan of talking. No.
You know you eventually do talk to me.
It's usually around Lyons.
You tell me about the time you
went there with your family.
Your brother got lost.
I've never been to Lyons.
You tell me your middle name.
Peyton.
That's not my middle name.
You found your brother in the arcade, by the way.
Well, maybe I made it all up just to keep you quiet.
But you do talk to me.
Cage, I do not need to get to know you.
And if you knew what was good for you,
you wouldn't want to get to know me either.
It's the only way you make it through this thing.
What about Hendricks?
You get to know him?
How do you know that name?
You mentioned him.
That's not possible.
Then how do I know his name?
When did I mention him?
Under what circumstance?
Is he why you won't talk to me?
Don't ever mention his name again.
Why? Are you... in love with him?
He's dead.
And I watched him die three hundred times,
and I remember... every detail.
I remember everything.
So I don't need to talk about it.
I'm sorry.
It's just war.
There's nothing here.
Let's keep going.
We have to find the keys.
Let's just siphon the gas.
Oh, why drive when we can fly?
In thing?
Let me guess.
You're afraid of heights.
I'm afraid of crashing.
And not at all ashamed to admit it.
You'll be fine, Cage. You'll learn.
What is it?
It's nothing. I'm fine.
What is it? It's nothing.
Rita.
Let me see.
We have to find the keys to the helicopter.
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.
You know the Heli's full of fuel, though.
I found a hose.
We're flying, Cage.
Let's just say we find the keys.
You know? Get that
helicopter started.
We don't have our jackets or ammunition.
It's gonna be dark in a few hours.
Might be better off just going back to the farmhouse.
Seeing what we could salvage.
You know? Spend
the night there.
Come back here in the morning.
And curl up by the fire and open a bottle of wine.
I think we should just reset.
Whoa! It's a dead end.
Hey, just--
if it's all the same to you, I'm tired.
I'm in pain. I'd rather
just start fresh.
I'll tell you what.
Take a few minutes.
Coffee's ready. I'll
look around for the keys.
That's productive.
Ten minutes. Okay.
And then I'm killing you.
Fine.
I can't believe you found coffee.
Thank you.
Oh.
Sugar, right?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Ah, hold on. Three.
You like three.
There's a shirt over there.
It should be your size.
RITA: How many times
have we been here?
How many times?
Where are the keys?
Where are the goddamn keys?
Yeah, okay.
You can fly it, can't you?
No. Well, yes. I
mean, I can take off.
I'm still working on my landing, so...
What are we still doing here?
You're wasting time!
Rita, if you start that engine you die.
This is far as you go.
No matter what I do...
This is as far as you ever make it.
There's a mimic buried twenty yards away.
It attacks when you start the engine.
Get your weapon and get in the helicopter, Cage.
There's more in the field back there.
Only one of us ever makes it.
Get in.
The only thing we haven't tried is the version
where you walk away. Just
go back to the farmhouse.
There's a cellar. There's food.
You wait there till I get back.
You'll be safe.
I'm a soldier. I volunteered.
I'm not walking away.
You die here.
Right here.
I... can't save you.
And if I go on and kill the Omega, you're dead.
Forever.
Why does it matter what happens to me?
I wish...
I didn't know you...
But I do.
My middle name...
Is rose.
SERGEANT: On your feet, maggot!
FARELL: The good news is
there's hope for you, Private.
Hope in the form of glorious combat.
Battle is the great redeemer,
the fiery crucible in which the
only true heroes are forged.
The one place where all men...
Yes?
Who said you could talk to me?
Have I got something on my face, soldier?
I'm sorry to disturb you, Sergeant.
All right, man, let's get this show on the road.
I gotta suit up.
SKINNER: Come on,
Kimmel, let's have it!
Where's your helmet?
Never wear one.
It's a distraction.
Have you been drinking?
I need three more clips
of five-five-six,
eight grenades and an extra battery.
Get it.
SKINNER: 'Ey!
Oi, mate!
I think there's something wrong with your suit.
There's a dead guy in it.
Woo-hoo! We made it!
Thank god, we made it!
Whoo--!
Finish it!
It isn't there.
What do you mean the Omega isn't there?
My guess is it never was.
They knew we were coming.
They ambushed us.
The visions were a trap.
Just like Rita's visions were a trap at Verdun.
It could have killed me but it didn't.
It's after my blood.
So they know who you are.
They-- they want their power back.
And they're gonna get it one way or another.
Unless we find the Omega.
The-- there isn't any other way.
We're finished.
No. We're finished.
That doesn't work. I-I
can't get it to work.
You built a prototype
at Whitehall--
yes, and I got fired for it, thank you very much.
Wh-what is this thing, anyway?
It's a transponder.
You stick it into the Alpha,
and it taps into the wavelength
connecting it to the Omega.
That's the idea, anyway.
But I can't get it to work.
Not with the equipment I have on hand.
How do we get you what you need?
Well, that's the thing.
I mean, when I was at whitehall I built one.
I was even ready to test it.
When I told my superiors about it...
Well, I lost my job.
They thought he was crazy.
So all we need to do is go to Whitehall.
You'd be arrested ten feet from the front door.
Psych ward. Dissection.
Remember?
Hey, hey, hey! Aren't you
forgetting something?
The transponder requires a live Alpha to make it work.
We don't need one. We
got the next best thing.
When the Chinese delegation comes out...
We pick up the pace.
This guy with the yellow armband always recognizes you...
So just keep your head down and stay to my right.
Nicely done.
Three, two, one.
Go.
One...
Six, seven...
Eight...
And, turn.
Okay. Keep walking. Just
stare straight ahead.
MAN: Robinson.
I've asked not to be disturbed.
This had better be critical.
CAGE: The fate of mankind.
Critical enough?
I don't believe what I'm seeing.
I've had more than my share of that.
RITA: Sit down, General.
Stay away from the desk.
I'd take her very seriously if I were you.
Have to hand it to you, Major.
When you left this office today,
I never imagined you'd be back,
let alone with my most decorated soldier.
I'm gonna tell ya a story, General.
And, at first, it's gonna sound ridiculous,
but the longer I talk, the more
rational it's going to appear.
Tell him you'll call back.
Tell who?
Major General Beaumont, calling from Halifax.
His plane has just been delayed.
Bad weather.
Yes.
Thank you, Beaumont.
I'll call you back.
Tomorrow's invasion is a slaughter.
I'm dead within five minutes of landing on that beach,
along with every other soldier you are sending.
And that's because the enemy knows we're coming.
How do I know this?
Before I died,
I killed a mimic, only this one was different.
It passed something on to me.
In my blood.
Now I live the same day over and over again.
Just like they do.
Just like Sergeant Vrataski...
At Verdun.
Tell your secretary everything's fine.
Beg your pardon?
Um, I'm... sorry, General.
I thought you were alone.
It's fine.
She typed up those orders for you to authorize.
But she left out the ones referring to the fuel dump
at Greenwich.
Your name is Iris.
Your birthday is September seventeenth.
The General quietly pulled some strings,
stationed your only son in Australia,
as far from the war as possible.
Tell the General his dinner's just been canceled.
The call came in just now.
Your dinner was canceled.
You forgot the fuel dump.
Thank you, Iris.
That'll be all.
Cage, let's go.
Rita.
Let me just-- what are we doing?
Please, don't shoot him again.
Okay?
Just-- just--
General, thi--
this isn't the first time we've
had this conversation, okay?
That's-that's-because
you're-you're stubborn.
You won't believe me when I tell ya
that Dr. Carter was right.
That the enemy can manipulate time.
The invasion will fail.
No matter how many bodies you throw at it.
The only way to win this war
is by finding this power source of the mimic horde
and killing it.
And the only means of finding it
is in that safe right there.
No matter how many times we have this conversation...
You refuse to accept
that the enemy breaks through to London tomorrow
and we lose.
We lose everything.
Let's say for one moment...
That I can't rationally explain...
Your impressive parlor tricks.
Dr. Carter told me...
This device requires a live mimic to work.
What use is it to you?
That's my concern.
On the contrary.
According to you, this concerns the whole world.
Well, what would you do
if you believed everything I just told you?
I would locate this...
Omega... and bomb it out of existence.
You're not mentally equipped to fight this thing.
And you never will be.
What do we do now?
I don't know. We've
never gotten this far.
That was easy.
Now! Stop!
Stop right there! Don't move!
Nobody move!
Weapon!
MAN: Stop!
They're off and away!
What am I supposed to do with this?
Stick it in your leg. Do it!
Cage, what's happening?
Talk to me.
I feel it. It's tak-it's
taking me there.
What do you see?
It's-it's the louvre.
Where? Where are you?
I'm inside now. It's flooded.
Now I'm going down. I'm
in a-I'm in a garage.
A garage underneath the museum.
The Omega. Can you see it?
It's in Paris.
Rita!
MAN: Turn your head!
Stay in the car!
Move away from the car!
Move away!
What have you done?
What have you done?
You'll be fine. You
just needed blood.
You don't know what you've just done.
I'm not allowed to talk to you.
I was with someone.
Rita Vrataski. Is she alive?
Rita Vrataski.
Please.
Just tell me that.
Please tell me.
I'm sorry.
I was out of those things in three minutes flat, Cage.
What's wrong with you?
I thought you were dead.
Not yet.
Sorry, Cage. No! Whoa-whoa.
Wait! Wait! I'm out. I'm out.
They gave me blood.
I lost the power.
I feel it.
I can't reset the day anymore.
WOMAN:
We have to kill the Omega...
Before the invasion starts.
That gives us less than three hours.
We need a drop ship to get to Paris in time.
Need more soldiers too.
Now who's crazy enough to follow us to Paris?
Cage!
Cage! Guys!
We've been lookin' everywhere for you.
Just... listen. Farell almost
strung us up by our bollocks
for losing track of you!
I know. I know. Just listen.
You're gonna wanna hear this story.
Now, it's gonna sound ridiculous at first,
but the longer I talk,
the more rational it's going to appear.
Yeah?
He named the school I went to.
And then he tells me my second grade teacher...
Was called miss polio.
She wouldn't let him go to the bathroom,
made him wet his pants.
Shut up.
Look, I am telling you, man.
He knows everything.
About all of us.
Bullshit. Yeah?
He says your name ain't really Ford.
Says Ford was your friend.
Died in combat on his first day.
You took his place. Send
your checks to his family.
NANCE: You slippery bitch.
SKINNER: Cage says the
enemy knows us too.
They're waitin' for us on the beach.
And we all die.
The whole invasion is a slaughter.
Well, this is great.
Really good confidence booster for tomorrow.
Thanks, Cage.
But we can change it, right?
I mean, there has to be somethin' that we can do.
There has to be... a
way that we can win.
There is a chance.
It's a slim one.
But it means coming with me... right now.
GRIFF: Listen, pal.
I don't really care what you think you know about us.
We just met you.
Come on.
Why would we follow him into combat?
I don't expect you to follow me.
I expect you to follow her.
That's the full metal bitch.
J squad.
This is Rita Vrataski.
Otherwise known as--
KUNTZ: Yeah, yeah.
The angel of Verdun.
Okay.
FARELL: It's a new day, people.
Destiny calls.
The world expects only one thing
FROM US: That we will win.
Rest assured the enemy will thank you
for not giving a hundred percent today.
Squad.
Where's J squad?
Right, okay. So this
Omega, it controls time.
Just blow the new age piece of bollocks
back where it came from.
And then we go home.
Right, it-it's
guarded by an Alpha.
Just kill it. Okay?
No!
You heard what Cage said.
Do not kill an Alpha.
If we kill an Alpha,
the Omega will reset this whole day.
We'll never even remember we had this conversation.
And they're gonna know we're coming.
So what am I supposed to do
if one of those alphas is about to kill me?
You take a hit for the team.
When we're on the ground...
There's not gonna be a lot of time
before they know we're there.
We're gonna need eyes up here.
I'm going in, Cage.
Thirty seconds till contact.
Cage!
Oh, no! Oh!
Kimmel! No!
Ford! Let's go!
Cage! Drop, Nance!
GRIFF: Talk to him, Rita!
We gotta go. Drop.
Cage, they know we're coming, man!
Drop!
Drop! Drop!
Drop.
You're not hooked in.
What took you so long?
Any others?
SKINNER: We're low on ammo.
I've got one claymore.
Ford, you're out.
Griff has only got half a magazine left
and he can hardly move.
I thought you could see the future.
I haven't lived this day.
I don't know what's gonna happen.
RITA: It doesn't matter.
What matters is we finish this.
FORD: With what?
I mean, Griff can't even walk.
We're three men down. Come on.
Look. We're running
out of time.
Collect your ammo.
SKINNER: There must
be a thousand mimics
between us and that pyramid.
So, what we gonna do?
Just walk up to the front door?
Is that it?
If we stay here, we die.
Yeah? We'll never get through.
We could.
In that.
That ship will never fly.
Doesn't need to fly.
It just needs to get us across there with speed.
If the engines are still running,
we could steer it with the power levers.
Skinner... clear a path.
RITA: Try it again, now.
No, it's not reading.
Condition lever, low.
Master power, on.
Griff!
We've gotta go! Come on!
I'm not gonna be any good in there, mate.
Let me buy you some time.
Power's on. This is gonna work.
FORD: Hey!
Hey, come on, man! We gotta go!
SKINNER: Don't wait for us!
Skinner!
Griff, come on!
We're good to go.
Where are they?
Where's Skinner and Griff?
They're not comin'.
GRIFF: Go, brother.
You gotta go, man.
I'll see you in the next life.
Bollocks.
Move over! Move over!
FORD: We gotta go!
Yo, we gotta go. Now!
They're coming, Cage.
Come on, you bastards!
Come on!
We got incoming!
Come on!
RITA: Cage!
You have to take over!
No!
Rita!
Punch it! Punch it!
We've been through worse.
Okay.
CAGE: It's there.
In the water. There.
That's an Alpha.
I'm gonna draw that thing away.
You kill the Omega.
No.
You won't make it ten feet
before that thing kills you, Cage.
I can do it.
Take the grenades. I can do it.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Neither one of us is getting out of here.
Thank you... for getting me this far.
You're a good man, Cage.
I wish I had the chance to know you better.
Welcome to London, Major.
I'm corporal Montgomery,
your liaison to General Brigham's press office.
Very good to have you.
Have you heard the news?
Isn't it brilliant.
BRIGHAM: Just before
sunrise this morning...
FARELL: What are you?!
Sound off!
ALL: I'm a warrior!
What do warriors do?!
Kill!
What are you gonna do?!
Kill!
You have not been in twenty battles, Ford.
I have too.
You're gonna dump your load
the second you hit the beach tomorrow, Ford.
How about you two go get yourselves
a nice hot cup of
shut-the-hell-up!
Ha ha! You funny, girl.
But I bet you I set some kind of record tomorrow.
Yeah. Fastest time runnin' backwards, Ford,
slippin' in your own shit.
FARELL: Knock off the grab-ass!
What are you?!
Sound off!
I'm a warrior!
What do warriors do?!
Kill!
MAN: Attention!
Yes?
What do you want?
I need to know now, know now
can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
can you love me again?
Can you love me again?
It's unforgivable
I stole and burnt your soul
is that what demons do?
They rule the worst of me
destroy everything
they bring down angels like you
now I'm rising from the ground
rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I've found
there's nothing I can't do
all right
I need to know now, know now
can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
can you love me again?
All right
oh, come on
all right
can you love me again?
Know, know, know, know
all right
yeah
oh
I told you once I can't do this again
do this again, oh, no
