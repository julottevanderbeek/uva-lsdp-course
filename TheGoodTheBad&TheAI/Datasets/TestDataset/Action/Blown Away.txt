Couldn't do it without you.
Ya bastard.

Sleep.
Unfortunately, you bastard...

No, you fuckin' don't!

I wished for Jimmy Dove
to be my dad.
You're supposed to keep wishes
to yourself.
- Birthday girl!
- Jimmy!
Ooh! Look at you!
- You've got a new party dress, huh?
- Hey there, Boomer.
- You look gorgeous.
- I know.
My mom bought me this dress
at the mall. It was $18.
$18? Not bad.
- Now, what's this? What's this?
- What's this? What is this thing?
Hey, get it.
Pull it out of there. Pull it!
Oh!
- A piano! Cool!
- You turn it on here.
§§
Thank you.
If your mom doesn't give you lessons
on that thing, I will.
- Look, Megan. Look what Jimmy got me.
- At your place, maybe.
- You look gorgeous too.
- Thank you.
Whoa!
- Here it is.
- You're such a show-off.
Oh! I like that.
I like that.
I'm getting close now.
I can feel it.
Ah, yeah! Did I win?
No!
- Boston Bomb Disposal.
- Yeah, Rita. Dove.
Sorry to bug you on your day off.
We got one.
- Yeah. Where?
- M.I.T. The computer lab.
- All right, I'll be over.
- Thanks.
- Thank you. Yeah.
- Bye.
-
- What was that all about?
- It's probably nothing.
- Don't worry about it.
Tell Lizzy I'll make it up to her, okay?
Don't worry about it.
I'll save you some cake.
- Have fun, okay?
- Got to.
Boomer, you stay here.
Fuck! Bombs and butts
are a bad combo, 'Bama.
All the way over
into the parking lot.
Hey, J.D.!
Sorry to call you
on your day off, partner.
How can I help you bums?
Dog sniffed out C-4,
about a half a pound of the shit.
Buried inside a computer.
There's a girl hooked up to the thing.
- Second floor, center.
- Her hacker boyfriend got jealous.
He rigged it so she's got to keep
typing. She quits, the building goes.
One more thing.
Before the boy blew his brains out...
he hooked up a counter
to the thing.
The hard drive gets full and...
- Who's in there with her?
- Cortez, and his little pal Manfred.
Can I bum a smoke?
Let's do her.
Captain, Manfred is all set to go.
Come on, Manfred.
Don't let me down, boy.
We're almost there, Nancy.
Hang on.
Come on, baby.
Attaboy.
Okay, Nancy. We're gonna have you
out of here pretty soon.
Don't look over there.
Look at me.
J.D., check it out.
Captain's a damn genius.
You like lemonade, Nancy?
A wicked, mad genius.
All right, Mary,
we're almost ready to go.
It's Nancy!
Right.
Okay, Cortez...
activate the B-board and get your Cuban
ass and Mary the hell out of there.
Come on, Manfred. Let's go.
Get ready.
Go.
Looks like this thing
might pay for itself yet.
- Get back to the keyboard!
- What is wrong now, you pile of shit?
Nancy, relax.
J.D.!
- Where is she?
- In there.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Dove.
James Dove.
Cortez, get Manfred out of here.
- Buy him a drink. He could use one.
- Hang on, hang on.
Nancy, what am I doing here?
This was my day off.
They called me in, I come.
But do you think they listen to me?
Forget about Manfred.
Get yourself a drink.
Make it a double.
Hmm. The disk drive sounds funny.
Something's slowin' it down.
I could've told you that.
What are we gonna do?
Gotta get between your legs, Nancy.
Liam, help me.
How much time we got?
How many bytes?
Bytes. How many?
Twenty-four.
I don't want to die.
Nance, don't give up on me.
You're doin' great.
There it is.
This is gonna be a piece of cake.
What was that?
Tell me something.
You like red wine or white wine?
I don't give a shit!
Just do something!
Red. Me too.
- She loves me.
- Hurry! Now!
She loves me...
Fond of suicide, J.D.?
Could you maybe dispose
of the device, huh, guys?
- Go do your job.
- Yeah, yeah.
Great work, Jimmy.
Dumb, but great work.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the building is still not safe.
Ryan! Don't!
Come on, now.
Pump, ya bastard!
Pump! Pump! Pump!
- Who needs the damn bubbles anyhow?
- Hey, Max.
- Hey, Jimmy!
- Thanks for the beer.
Come by for a dip, did ya?
- Not with no bubbles.
- Screw it! Screw the damn bubbles!
All I need anyhow is some hot water
to soak my weary bones.
Believe me, they're weary.
Heard you had yourself a doozy
down at Cambridge today.
Yeah.
You should've taken my advice
and stayed on as a beat cop like I did.
A lot easier dodging bullets
than bombs.
When did you know
it was time to get out?
How'd I know it was time to get out?
I think I knew it was time...
as soon as I started asking myself
if I thought it was time.
You've been asking yourself
that question a lot, have ya?
It's time, friend.
You've done your penance.
Yeah?
Then why don't I feel absolved?
Don't know, Jimmy.
How come, huh?
Come on. No bubbles,
but the hot water'll do you good.
§§
Hey, fella, drinks.
Come on.
- That's for you, my darlin'.
- Thank you.
That's for you, my dear.
Put it on my tab, Francis.
- Cash.
- Cash?
I'll look in me pockets.
Just moments ago, Lt. James Dove of the
Boston Bomb Squad came racing down...
this lawn behind me, helping
a visibly distraught...
Hey, fella!
Fella! Hey!
...that he had no bomb equipment
on as he came out of the building.
James Dove?
Boomer, get down.
...rushing out of M.I.T.
All the police activity indicates...
- Look, Mom. Jimmy's on TV.
- He's been identified as...
Lieutenant James Dove,
who successfully disengaged a device.
They are looking
for a secondary device.
See you guys later.

Well, we have a new soloist.
Kate, you appear to be here,
but you're not playing like it.
I'm sorry.
People, please. We've only got three
weeks to put this whole thing together.
We don't want to let down
our founding fathers, do we?
- Do we?
-  No!
Fireworks will be popping in the sky.
I want to hear them popping out of you.
Feels like we're playing

- Let's take it back to letter P.
Excuse me.
How are the mussels?
Mmm, what do you think?
Not bad. Hmm?
Looked good on TV too.
Out there showin' off again.
You like being a hero, don't ya?
- Why does it always have to be you?
- It doesn't.
- I was wondering about that. Want more?
- Yeah, thanks.
- I put in for a teaching job.
- Why?
- I beg your pardon?
- That's crazy.
You're good at what you do.
You love it.
- We know you're gonna keep doing it.
- I'm putting in for a teaching job.
- I thought you'd love that.
- Pass the cheese, please.
Hmm?
Really. Then what?
You think I love what I do,
but I don't.
You think you know me.
You don't.
I can't sleep, okay?
I puke my guts out
when I shut one down.
Keep remembering things
I want to forget.
I can't do it anymore.
All right?
Everything's different now.
You and Lizzy...
My life's all different.
What?
I guess.
What?
I'm so scared of you
doing this for us...
and then regretting it.
Okay.
All right.
Look.
Oh, this is so sweet.
This is the wrong time?
No regrets, Katie.

- Dance? Will you dance with me?
- She's a pretty one.
Save yourself for tonight.
Come here and dance. Ho!
Congratulations.
-  Good luck, buddy.
- I'm gonna need it.
Settle down.
Hear? Settle down.
Quit your bollocksing around.
It's time to toast the bride and groom.
So, raise your glasses!
Here's to the wings of love.
May they never lose a feather...
as long as his big shoes
and her wee little shoes...
are under the bed together!
And, Jimmy, a word of advice now
that you've retired from the field:
If your married life gets a little dull,
and you start getting restless...
I don't know how that's possible.
You tell him, sweetheart.
Just think of your stupid friends here
diffusin' bombs.
Then thank your lucky stars you're home
watching the telly with your bride.

- Who invited Michael Jackson?
- I don't know. He invited himself.
His name is Anthony Franklin.
Your replacement and my new partner.
Hey, I wouldn't go calling
no damn rookie Jim's replacement.
I don't know.
The more I hear about Franklin...
the better I feel
about Jimbo becoming a teacher.
Decorated by the mayor.
Two years on the SWAT team.
Clarence Thomas's acting coach.
And I hear he's hung
like a China mule.
-  Who told you that?
-  Your wife.
Congratulations, Lieutenant.
Hell of a party you're having here.
I'm Anthony Franklin,
your replacement.
Hey, hey, hey!
Yeah, well, so I heard.
Welcome to the party, Tony.
No, it's Anthony. It's Anthony.
I hate abbreviations. You too?
But you didn't know that.
You don't mind me crashing your party?
You know, the team and all.
God, I heard a lot about you.
And I know you heard a lot
about me.
I bet you wish you could see
some of my moves.
I saw your moves, Anthony.
I've got my lady waiting downstairs.
Enjoy your retirement, Lieutenant.
- I plan to.
- See you, guys.
Hee-hee!
Watch yourself.
Peace.
- Cocky son of a bitch.
- Yeah. He reminds me...
of a cocky son of a bitch
that I once knew.
-
-  Geez, not tonight!
Nothing to be alarmed about.
It's probably just a tease.
Party on!
- We're gonna miss you, Jimmy.
- It's your turn, Blanket. Show 'em how.
Try to come back.
- Save me one dance.
- Okay.
§§
There. Look.

Come here.
Where are you taking me
on our honeymoon? Compost?
Wait a minute. I thought you
were taking me on a honeymoon.
It's Quepos. Costa Rica.
I think you'll like it.
Hmph. Yeah.
- Bomb squad. Cortez speaking.
- Hey, Robby.
Hey, Jimmy!
Mazeltov, buddy.
I'm sorry I couldn't go to the wedding.
Roarke wouldn't give me the day off.
- Don't worry. You weren't missed.
-
- What happened with the call?
- Manfred and I weren't invited.
They're under the River Street Bridge
still trying to shut it down.
Give me a call
if you hear anything.
Don't worry about it.
Blanket can handle it.
You concentrate on the missus.
Listen.
You need some love tips
from the Cuban missile here?
I'm at the Four Seasons
if you hear anything.
- Adios, buddy.
- Bye.
They'll be all right.
Come on.
Let's go back to bed.
Yeah, baby.
I got something for you.
Ah! Shit!
Wait a minute.
Put another barrier
to keep people out.
Yeah, we're checkin' it out now.
Yeah. All right.
Jimmy. It's Blanket.
He was under the bridge usin'
the shotgun to detonate the device.
It was a simple gig.
Something got screwed up, Jimmy.
Fuck.
And on your wedding day, Liam.

Why is it a man always get thrown
his best party when he dies?
Joseph, excuse me.
I don't think
the guy stands a chance.
That's the guy you want at the plate
with ducks on the pond.
The bum is hitless
in the last ten at bats.
Here's the pitch. And there's...
Captain.
- I got your replacement for you.
- Who, that Bolinski kid?
No, me. 'Til we get this guy.
You're in retirement, remember?
Fred, the bomb that killed Blanket
was made from scratch.
- The guy distilled the ANFO himself.
- How do you know that?
I tasted it.
Franklin is not ready for this guy.
Franklin is not the only technician
we got.
You've got a blaster out there,
a real one.
The ducks are on the pond.
I'm the one you want at the plate.
- I'll take it under advisement.

You smell like beer.
How do you know
what beer smells like?
- Good night.
- Good night.
Jimmy, did it hurt Blanket
when he died?
No, sweetheart, it didn't.
- Go to sleep now.
- Don't shut the door all the way.
Okay.
Land mines. This sucker here
is particularly nasty.
It's called a Bouncing Betty.
It's buried in the ground.
It clicks when you step on her.
When you step off,
it jumps up to crotch level...
and blows good-bye to whatever
brass balls you might have.
Girlfriend says mine are golden.
She let me know this.
You think this is funny?
Hmm?
Yes, I think Betty
is very funny.
I'm glad you're enjoying this.
Come up and take a look at Betty.
Show the kids
how you take her down.
Watch and learn.
You have to get under it, get a clean
look at the bitch's firing spring.
- Click.
-  Uh-oh.
Now that's funny.
That's nice.
Don't move. Don't move.
That's a live one.
See?
Boomer knew.
Rule number one when you're
disarming Betty: Don't step on her.
Love a challenge.
And my Betty's come with a timer.
You had 60 seconds.
Come on, Boomer. Let's get out of here.
Yeah, run.
Run!
- See school's going well.
- Yeah. I was born to teach.
- You got anything?
- Blanket's coroner's report.
Keep it under your hat, will ya?
Captain's already on my butt.
Wants to know why you got Franklin
back in basic.
-
- That's hilarious.
- He needed some work on his Bettys.
- Thanks, Rita.
- What happened?
- Recess is over.
Thanks for the entertaining
display there, Franklin.
That was Leaping Anthony
and his Bouncing Betty.
I hope you enjoyed that.
Looks like you got a little work
cut out for you, buddy.

- How much for the toy?
- That's Justin's.
- It's not for sale.
- I was hoping to get one for my nephew.
He lives in Dublin.
Can't find such a toy there.
- He's not getting this one.
- It would mean so much to him.
He got hurt in a car accident.
Lost a leg, he did.
- Shouldn't be driving then.
- Justin!
Five dollars.
Ten?
You're a capitalist?
Can I interest you in this U2 tape?
It's only a dollar.
- 'U' who?
- U2. You know, the Irish band?
- Oh.
- Come on. Everybody knows U2.
You'll have to excuse my ignorance.
I've been out of the mainstream a bit.
But I'll give it a listen,
see what the lads are doin' these days.
You're a caring mother.
It's very pretty.
-  What are you doing?
-  Nothing.
You are cruisin' for a bruisin'.
- How many have you eaten of these?
- Four or three.
- You're gonna get sick from that.
- No, I won't!
-  Sorry. I only have a 20.
- You can pay me later.
So what are the winds
a-tellin' ya, laddie?
Only the bomb squad
is supposed to be down here.
Aren't you supposed to be
in a classroom somewhere...
tinkerin' around
with little toy bombs?
Disarming wasn't an option?
Are you second-guessing me?
It was motion-sensitive.
We found nine triggers. Any one of a
hundred wires could have done the deal.
- One of them had to be a ground.
- Right.
And you would have known
which one to cut, huh?
- Why'd he shoot from here?
- I picked the spot.
It's the safest place.
There's zero likelihood
of shrapnel here.
I don't get it.
He was protected.
I don't get it!
Son of a bitch!
Say what?
Most of the bomb's force was aimed
up at the bridge, right?
But the drum is like a bazooka.
There's recoil. Where did the recoil go?
- The overpressure? Hmm?
- The overpressure went down.
- Yeah, down. But then where?
- Down here.
The coroner said that Blanket died
of a concussion.
Hmm? The bastard!
- He bounced it!
- Bounced it?
Are you saying he tried to do this,
he planned for the kickback?
He was playing the bank shot.
Look at the angle. Huh?
He was aiming for Blanket.
Then how would he know where he'd be?
You said it: the safest place.
He knew the shooter'd go right here...
'cause this is exactly where
he wanted him to go.
Then he was trying to kill one of us.
That's what you're saying.
Hey, Jimbo!
- Hey, Rita.
- Just a tease, Jimmy.
-  Where's the device?
- In the trolley.
Hola, Jim.
Our boy did real good today, Jimbo.
- Where is everybody? Where's Roarke?
- Back there.
- Come with mama, baby.
- Vamos, babaloo. Volante! Volante!
Forget about the bridge.
Stay out of the trolley.
I'm goin' to the trolley.
What's the matter, Jimmy?
- Check the area for secondary devices?
-  The perimeter is clear.
- Did you print this shit? Is it printed?
- It's all been bagged and tagged.
This theory about Blanket is not enough
reason for you to be on active duty.
Listen to what he's got to say.
There's no harm in listening...
- Back off!
- Fine.
- Jimmy...
- Hey, hey! Hey, Jim.
This is not the way to go, man.
Look, I'm just as sick
over Blanket's death as you are.
If somebody wanted to kill one of us,
it wouldn't be much trouble.
He'd just blow the shit
out of him.
This is silly putty, not plastique.
You're not makin' any sense!
It's the only way to go, Cap.
It's the only theory.
Let's look at this stuff, see if there's
a connection with what happened there.
Nobody's gonna make fun of him now.
He did a great job today.
- He gets a gold star.
- He's a good boy.
- You treat him like a son.
- Our son.
Damn! Cortez!
Rita!
Out of the way! No!
Get back!
Get back!

Cortez!
No!

Oops, I called you Liam.

Much more lyrical than Liam McGivney.
Much less Irish.
Listen to me.
I've come to bring you a gift.
What gift is that, Gaerity?
It's the gift of pain, of course.
You're the reason they died.
- Not me!
- Ryan!
Blame, blame, blame.
And I suppose I'm to blame for
the deaths of your new pals as well.
Who's right? Who's wrong?
We were at war.
Your conscience ended up causing
the death of your own, Liam.
You're a bad boy.
You made me trigger the bomb too early.
I was trying to stop you.
You said nobody would get killed.
There was people everywhere!
And look who paid.
Your own sweetheart, your friends, me.
While you've been in America, a hero,
I've been a man without a country.
I spent the last 20 years of my life
in jail or on the run because of you.
Ha, ha, ha!
But don't let me get morose on ya.
Fate's brought us together again.
I've come to Boston. Fine place for
a man to lose himself, wouldn't you say?
And what do I find? My old pal...
on the telly!
If they only knew
what you'd done.
I did what I did because you told me
I was a soldier!
- But I never killed anybody!
- Did you ever hear of the Big Bang?
They think the universe was created
from an explosion.
Can you imagine that, Liam?
An explosion!
Goddamn you, Gaerity.
- Look what you've done.
- You've got me all wrong.
I'm not a destroyer.
I'm a creator.
You're not a creator.
You're a sick freak, is what you are.
I've come here to create a new country
for you called chaos...
and a new government
called anarchy.
- All for you.
- I can't believe I bought your shit.
Civilians die in war, Liam.
But you disobeyed orders.
You betrayed the cause.
You never gave a damn
about the cause.
The only thing that ever turned you on
were your goddamn bombs!
And what lovely ladies they are, Liam.
I was watching out.
Tell me, Liam, how close were you
when she went?
Ryan, why don't you come down here
and face me?
- Could you smell her flower, Liam?
- What? Are you still there?
You're a chickenshit, Ryan.
I've enjoyed talking to you, Liam.
I don't want to be rude, but I must go.
Your new wife and daughter
just got home.
Did you leave the window open?
I don't know. I'll check.
- No, let's put the stuff in the kitchen.
- All right.
Thirsty, bug?
- I'd like red juice, please.
- Okay.
Boomer?
Boomer?
He must've jumped the fence again.
- He'll be back.

Sure. I'll call her mom and ask.
