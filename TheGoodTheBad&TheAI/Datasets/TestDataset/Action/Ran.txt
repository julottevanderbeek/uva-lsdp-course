The arrow which
felled the boar...
belonged to Lord Ichimonji.
Drink to him!
The wily old beast...
shot out right
in front of me.
My horse reared...
Before I could aim, off I fell.
Father...
shall we roast the boar?
He was old.
His hide is though, it stinks.
Indigestible.
Like me, old Hidetora
Would you eat me?
You'd stick in our throats.
That's why I joined your hunt...
to reinforce our friendship.
I, too!
I would cement the bonds...
between the houses of
Ichimonji and Ayabe...
I would marry my daughter...
to your son Saburo.
Hold on!
That's my own intention.
Lord Ichimonji,
the day is propitious.
Give us your answer.
Whom will you have for Saburo...
my daughter or Lord Ayabe's?
Not an easy choice.
Two daughters...
for one son.
A pity, Jiro, my second son,
already has a wife.
Kyoami!
Entertain us!
From the far mountain...
From the near mountain...
Who comes hippety-hopping...
Showing off his handsome ears?
A hare!
Only one hare, Kyoami?
Two, I think.
Hopping here to be eaten by
Father.
Suburo, that's rude!
Hold your tongue!
The Great Lord is tired.
Let us withdraw until he wakes.
This is unlike Father.
He only pretends to sleep.
After Saburo's insult...
how else could he save face?
All he did was hunt.
In the old days...
he'd rout an army
and not be winded.
It's impolite to our guests.
Kyoami, wake him!
Father worries me...
he's barely snoring today.
Father, what is it?
Are you ill?
A dream...
I had a dream.
I was in a strange land.
A vast wilderness.
I went on and on,
but met no one.
I called, I shouted...
but no one answered.
I was alone.
Alone in the wide world.
I felt a chill...
Such stupidity!
Taro's voice pulled me back...
I saw my beloved children.
Taro...
Jiro...
Saburo.
Father, I've never
seen you like this.
It's not right.
Quiet, Saburo!
Be thankful we have his
affection.
I'm puzzled, too.
I can scarcely believe my ears.
Normally all he asks is our
obedience.
That's affection enough.
All right.
I've been considering an idea...
and I've reached a decision.
I want to tell it to you.
Now is a good time to do it...
while we have with us...
Lords Fujimaki and Ayabe.
Bring them!
I, Hidetora Ichimonji...
was born in that small castle
in the mountains.
At that time,
this entire plain...
seethed with constant battle.
Many lords vied for power.
At the age of seventeen...
I flew my banner
over that castle.
I waged war for fifty years...
and at last the plain was mine.
I hoisted my colours
over the main castle.
I spent more years...
fighting lance to lance...
with these two gentlemen.
Now the moment has come...
to stable the steeds of war...
and give free rein to peace.
But old Hidetora...
is seventy years old.
I hereby cede total authority...
over all my dominions...
to my eldest son Taro.
My lord, this is so sudden...
Not at all.
I've thought long and hard.
There comes a time...
to step aside...
and pass on the reins
to younger hands.
I say to you: That time is now!
This is my will.
Taro is now head of the
Ichimonjis...
Iord of these lands.
I will quit the castle keep...
and move to the outer tower.
I will retain a 30-man escort...
and the title and insignia
of Great Lord.
But the actual leadership...
lies entirely with Taro.
I expect all of you to obey!
I'll obey.
But what about me and Saburo?
What do you intend for us?
I give you, Jiro and Saburo...
the Second and Third Castles...
with their attendant lands.
You will support Taro...
in the First Castle.
I shall be your guest...
visiting each castle in turn...
living out my remaining years.
How hard it is to be old.
I would speak.
I respect your wishes...
and appreciate your trust...
but I get you to reconsider.
Why?
Though I am your eldest son...
I could never take your place.
It is too great a task.
I always pray to
the God of War...
"Let his life last 100 years..."
"even if it means
shaving a bit off mine."
What a pretty speech.
I cannot use such honeyed words.
I'd be embarrassed.
Don't be spiteful!
You mean Taro only flatters me?
Pay no attention to Saburo.
I feel the same as Taro.
We'd like nothing better...
than to stay behind your shield.
But it's our turn
to shield you...
from life's bitter arrows.
Well said, Jiro.
Bring me that quiver!
Break an arrow in two.
Can you do it?
Bundle them...
and try again.
A single arrow is easily broken.
Not so three together.
Whenever Taro is in trouble...
if you unite your forces...
the house of Ichimonji
will be safe.
Even in a sheaf...
More of your pranks.
Stop being foolish.
It's you who are foolish.
Your plan is absurd.
You are either senile or mad.
Silence!
Do not insult your father!
What madness have I spoken?
Wherein lies my senility?
I'll tell you.
What kind of world do we live
in?
One barren of loyalty and
feeling.
I'm aware of that.
So you should be!
You spilled an ocean of blood.
You showed no mercy, no pity.
We too are children
of this age...
weaned on strife and chaos.
We are your sons,
yet you count on our fidelity.
In my eyes,
that makes you a fool.
A senile old fool!
So that's it!
You mean one day...
you'll forget I'm your father.
You'll betray me.
More folly!
Does a traitor betray himself?
Then you mean your brothers?
He's jealous of Taro's position.
Is that why you slander me?
Brother or not, watch your step!
Your lesson of the three arrows
was wasted.
The unity of the three sons is
split.
You scorn your father's wishes?
Parents and children
have no place in this worlds?
Very well, since you
will have it so...
I cut the bond between us!
You are a stranger to me.
Out of my sight!
You mustn't!
Quiet, Tango.
My mistake was to love him too
well.
I spoiled him.
It's my fault he's arrogant.
But it's too late for regrets.
When flesh is rotten...
even our own...
cut it away!
Wait, my lord!
Master Saburo is blunt...
perhaps even disrespectful.
But his words are honest
and come from the heart.
Consider well: You will find...
he is not wrong.
- Silence!
- I will speak.
Begone!
I will stay.
You disobey me?
My duty to you is to speak my
mind.
Brandish your sword, I won't
move.
Revoke this rash decision.
Your insolence matches his!
I will not have it!
I banish you both!
Father!
What misery!
What will you do now?
I grieve for Father, not myself.
The horror ahead of him...
Tango, you're an idiot.
Why?
For defending me and being
banished.
Your place is with Father.
He needs you.
They're following us!
Wait, son-in-law!
Why do you run away?
Son-in-law?
Hear me out!
You're in disgrace,
exiled from your lands.
Lord Ayabe and I...
witnessed the whole incident.
You are an outcast...
little more than a beggar.
Forgive my rudeness...
What I'm trying to say...
I can't find the words.
The meaning is clear.
No lord chooses a beggar...
for his daughter.
Of course not.
No... now hold on!
Lord Ayabe rejected the
marriage.
But on my way home
I got to thinking...
of your extraordinary conduct.
I like the way you spoke up.
You have character and courage.
You'd make a fine son-in-law.
I retraced my steps...
but you had gone.
Does my offer interest you?
How can I know?
Then come stay with me...
while you think it over.
You too, Tango.
You are honest and loyal.
I can use you, will you come?
Thank you for your generosity...
but I cannot accept.
Whatever disguise
I must adopt...
I shan't abandon the Great Lord.
What's going on?
Hidetora's concubines
are moving from the castle.
They block my lady's retinue.
Scandalous!
I am now the mistress here!
They must make way!
My women kneeling to Taro's
wife?
Intolerable!
Why do you say that?
You gave him the castle keep.
It's only natural.
Gives away his house...
Gives away his land...
His bounty earns him
a new title...
Lord of the rice fields.
A scarecrow!
Call me a fool?
No, the fool is me...
for serving as butt
to your laughing-stock.
But you're another for losing
your keep.
You know, Kaede...
the view is more pleasant...
now that is it mine.
As I recall...
a banner used to hang there.
Yes, Father's banner.
Also his helmet and armour.
Where are they?
I gave them to Father's men.
The armour doesn't matter.
But the banner...
My lord...
it belongs with the head
of the house of Ichimonji.
But Father is keeping
his title and insignia.
Without them, you are a shadow.
What do you mean?
He made it clear...
that I am now in command.
In that case...
behave as if you are.
You want the banner?
Ridiculous! You take
back what you give.
It is Lord Taro's order!
See the lord, a gourd in the
wind.
Swinging this way...
Swaying that way...
Spinning as the breeze blows.
So high up, dangling
hollow from the tower.
Isn't it fun?
Villain! I'll teach you!
See the lord, a gourd in the
wind.
Swinging this way...
Swaying that way...
Spinning as the breeze blows.
So high up...
Dangling hollow from the tower.
What fun, what fun!
It's Ogura.
I have a message.
Lord Taro is holding
a family gathering...
to celebrate the transfer
of power.
He invites his honoured father.
You too, Lord lkoma.
Your "family gathering"...
is only us?
Please, Father-in-Law...
won't you sit down?
I am to sit below you?
Who am I?
The honourable father of my
husband.
Is that all?
And the Great Lord...
is he dead?
Don't joke.
I'm not joking!
I retain my title and my status.
Have you forgotten?
No, of course not.
It's you who forget...
you gave full authority to me.
What do you want?
I gave you this castle...
I moved out,
reduced my escort...
They may be few in number...
but they're boisterous enough.
What is that song?
With such goings-on...
how can I make myself obeyed?
They are warriors,
unschooled in manners.
They like comic songs.
Comic songs can go too far!
That song makes fun of me!
My guard was defending
my honour.
Yet you went ahead
and killed him.
I cannot allow that.
This once, I'll overlook it.
But I must have your promise...
that it won't happen again.
You will sign this...
and seal it with your blood.
"Pledge"...
This is nonsense!
Read it.
"Pledge"
"Firstly...
"I cede to Taro Takatora
the domains of Ichimonji."
"Secondly..."
"I make him sole ruler
of the house of Ichimonji."
"Thirdly..."
"Though I am Taro's father..."
"I shall submit
to his authority..."
"and act accordingly."
"I swear by all the deities."
"May they punish me
if I disobey."
I'm to seal this with my blood?
This silly thing?
Everything it contains...
was proclaimed by you
yourself...
before witnesses.
What does it change
if you sign it?
Are you a son?
What do you mean?
Is this a son's attitude?
The hen pecks the cock...
and makes him crow.
I will not stay here.
Fortunately...
I have another son.
Thank you, you did well.
I was born and raised
in this castle.
It belonged to my father.
I left it to marry you.
My father and brothers,
after the marriage...
relaxed their vigilance.
Hidetora murdered them.
Now I am back
in my family castle...
How I have longed for this day.
Right there...
my mother took her own life.
Father is on his way.
My brother sent him packing.
He says Father grows
eccentric...
it would be unwise
to let him stay here.
Father's counsellor, lkoma...
is privy to my brother's plans.
This severity is unlike
Lord Taro.
And you, my lord...
why do you do nothing?
He's right.
You should succeed
the Great Lord.
Lord Taro is a weakling.
The stake is large:
Gamble for it.
Then you are all willing...
to gamble with me?
Absolutely.
Dogs turn on a master...
who gives up the chase.
Sound the horn or become
the quarry.
How the dogs howl!
I must say, I find it unfair.
Born twelve months after Taro...
so all my life
I must grovel at his feet.
- Crack these bonds!
- Good for you, my lord!
Don't like your chops yet.
Taro is easy pickings.
His wife, Lady Kaede,
is another story.
Quite true.
She'd be a perfect match
for you.
Why not steal her?
Don't be impertinent.
First of all, there's Father.
He still has thirty warriors.
Each one is worth a thousand.
He'll soon be here...
and so will they.
Any ideas?
Open the gates!
Hidetora is here!
I will seek out Sue first.
Tell Jiro I want to see him.
Sue!
Praise be...
to the Eternal Western Paradise.
Praise be to
the Eternal Buddha...
in 36 trillion manifestations.
Praise be to Amida Buddha.
I knew you'd be here.
Father-in-Law!
Never mind the ceremony.
It's been a long time.
Let me look at you.
Still the same sad face.
When I see you...
it breaks my heart.
It's worse when you smile.
I burned down your castle...
you father and mother perished.
And you look at me like that.
Look upon me with hatred.
It would be easier to bear.
Go on, hate me!
I don't hate you.
All is decided
in our previous lives.
The Buddha embraces all things.
Buddha again!
He is gone from this evil world.
His guardians are in exile...
routed by the fury of Ashur.
We can't rely on Buddha's mercy.
There you are, Jiro.
I've come to be your guest.
I'm disappointed in Taro.
I know everything.
It's all in my brother's letter.
Taro wrote to you?
He says your guards...
were unruly and vulgar.
I am to receive you
with courtesy.
But I cannot let
your warriors...
inside the castle walls.
What's this??
I'm to come in alone...
leaving my men to rot outside?
My brother is the head
of the clan.
I have no choice
but to obey him.
If you dislike his conditions...
then it might be best...
to go back and apologize.
Apologize to Taro?
Go back?
Stop!
Lord Kurogane. Lord Shirane!
What does this mean?
Lord lkoma!
An order from Hidetora.
"We arrived suddenly..."
"the castle is unprepared."
"Withdraw and wait outside."
Enough is enough.
I understand.
You too...
you're just like Taro.
You want to be rid of me.
I'm too much trouble.
That's not true.
If you were alone,
I'd welcome you gladly.
The Great Lord goes
nowhere alone.
You renounced your power.
You have no need of an escort.
Only the birds and the beasts...
live in solitude.
I've heard enough excuses.
Open the gates!
You needn't worry.
It's not for my men to enter...
but for me to leave!
Open the gates!
Now close them!
I will not see you again.
Ever!
The villages are deserted.
Not a grain of rice anywhere.
The peasants took everything
and fled to the mountains.
My lord!
We must go to the Third Castle.
It was your first victory.
Go back to where you started...
No, lkoma!
If I could do that...
would I roam the plain hungry?
Use your head!
What kind of welcome
would I get...
I, who banished
the lord of the castle?
By order of
Lord Taro Takatora...
head of the Ichimonji clan...
I take possession
of this castle.
Open the gates!
Without our master, Saburo...
the castle is nothing to us.
We leave it to you.
We will follow him
and die for him.
We hear he is with
Lord Fujimaki.
We go to join him.
