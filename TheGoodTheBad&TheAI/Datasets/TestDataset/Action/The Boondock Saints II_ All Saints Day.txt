Something's happened.
No! Stop! Stop, stop!
Please, stop! Oh, God! Please! Please!
God, no, stop.. .
A priest?
Did they release his name?
No, but l made a few calls.
l still have friends in the diocese there.
McKinney. Father Douglas McKinney.
-You knew him?
-Knew of him. Everybody did.
He's a good man.
Youth hostels, soup kitchens.
He even made it to the papers sometimes.
Look, boys,
l think it's best if you just stay put
until we try to figure out
what the hell is going on.
Aren't you at least gonna try
and talk them out of this?
For all we know, it could be somebody
just trying to get away with murder here.
Aye.
Only there's a thousand easier ways
to do that.
Trust me.
Someone's trying to call them out.
You kill a priest, in a church,
and make it look like it was them.
Bring them back with a vengeance.
Someone thinks it's really clever.
-Only one problem with this little plan.
-What's that?
lt worked.
Exactly what do you intend to do?
Every last motherfucker
that had anything to do with it.
As you can see, the size of the crowd here
has increased substantially
as we have confirmed that the body
was ritualized with pennies in the eyes.
Many remember this
as the grisly calling card
of the prolific vigilante killers
known as the Saints,
and then simply disappeared without a trace.
We need to keep our heads here.
lt's probably not even them.
Course it ain't them.
lt doesn't really matter, does it?
All our skeletons just came screaming
out of the closet.
-We're fucked!
-We're not fucked!
We are totally fucked! And not just fucked.
Like elephant-dick-pounded-in-the-ass,
no-reach-around,
-jungle-fucked!
-Now's not the time to panic, green beans!
l disagree! Now is a perfect time to panic.
We are all accessories.. .
-Don't fucking say it!
-l'm gonna say it, all right.
-You've got a mouth on you, Greenly.
-Both of you calm down. Just calm down.
Shut the fuck up!
Her ETA's 10 minutes.
Thanks, Seamus.
lt's game time. How we playing this?
Feds love to pull
the divide-and-conquer routine.
We hardline her. Stick together on this.
-Agreed?
-Agreed.
We're a brick wall.
Let's rock this bitch.
Eunice Bloom. lt's a pleasure.
Now, you have got to be Greenly.
Smecker always said
you were the funny one.
Well, funny as in ''ha-ha,'' though,
not like funny as in ''gay,''
'cause l'm totally not.
What we're trying to figure out is,
with all due respect, Agent Bloom.. .
-''Special.' '
-Excuse me?
You see, there's a ''special''
before my ''agent.' '
lf we're gonna address each other formally,
l'd appreciate if you popped it in there,
because it makes me feel special.
Of course, l was hoping
we could be a bit more personable.
ln fact, l'd welcome you to call me Eunice,
and maybe l.. .
Okay, Eunice.
l don't see why the fuck the Fed
is even involved.
''Fuck''? This isn't a ''fuck'' situation, is it?
l mean, l can understand a ''goddamn''
or two, but why skip all the way.. .
What is the Fed's interest in this?
Their interest, Detective,
is capturing the men responsible
for the murders
of 22 of Boston's finest criminals.
They could have sent anyone. They sent me.
Now, why do you think that is?
Well, since we've already broken
the ''fuck'' barrier, allow me to be blunt.
lt is because l am so fucking smart
that l make smart people feel
that they are retarded.
-Motherfuckers! Which one do you want?
-Me first, man, me first!
Bust his head!
That son of a bitch over there!
All right! House is closed, motherfuckers!
Why are his hands chained?
Romeo is very fast, man.
He says the Frenchman can't lay
a hand on him.
But he can't hit him back.
That's the bet,
He's got to last five minutes.
-Fifty on the Mexican.
-Fifty on the Mexican.
Never fight a Mexican, Pierre.
Pound for pound,
toughest motherfuckers on Earth!
Attaboy!
You know why? We like pain, Pierre.
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, come on!
Think about it, man. Tabasco sauce?
What kind of fucked-up people
would even invent that shit?
Get the fuck out of the way!
Whore.
Don't be scared, now.
Remember, l can't hit you.
l ain't gonna hit you!
Found a loophole, bitch!
l ought to be a lawyer.
Thank you!
Shit, man!
Please, stop! Oh, God! Please!
Please! Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh, God!
lt wasn't them,
but l'm sure you boys already knew that.
All their vics were criminals.
Clearly not the case here.
So, it wasn't them,
which makes this a local matter
and falls under our jurisdiction.
So, with all due respect,
we'll see you later, Special Agent Bloom.
''With all due respect.' '
Man, l hate it when people say that,
because it is inevitably followed
by a disrespectful remark.
Here, let me give you an example.
With all due respect, Detective,
this matter falls under whatever jurisdiction
l fucking say it does.
-You fucking.. .
-Let's just.. .
What can you tell us about the shooters?
''Shooter.' ' Singular.
And l can tell you.. .
How shall l put this delicately?
He's a short little fucker.
One guy. Dwarf. Got it.
Let me show you what l'm talking about.
Detective Greenly,
you're the victim.
David. You can call me David.
Very well, David.
The Saints' signature stance,
Copley Plaza Hotel eight years ago.
Two men of identical height
put Yuri Petrova on his knees
and each dropped iron
to the back of his head.
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand.
Eyes front, David.
The position of the victim and the angles
produced by the killers' stance
created a unique scenario.
The bullets crisscrossed in the skull
and exited the eyes.
Here, this did not occur.
The rounds moved on a straight trajectory
through the back of the victim's head
and out the front,
which happens when.. .
One guy's holding two guns
to the back of your head.
One guy.
But you said he was wicked short.
The Saints were later determined
to be 5'1 1'' tall.
The rounds exit Petrova's eyeballs.
Here, they came out the lower cheek,
three, four inches below the eyes.
That puts him at 5'7''-ish.
That's not uncommonly short.
The killer posed as a late-night confessor.
Once the victim entered the booth,
the killer had him isolated. No escape.
Short stuff comes out of the confessional,
kicks in the door of the priest's chambers,
leaving a crescent-shaped indentation,
-That's wicked short.
-Wicked.
l can't believe
that none of us were consulted on this!
The disrespect!
We never would have okayed such a thing.
A priest! lt's
Are we not Catholics?
For Christ's fucking sakes!
And for what? Revenge?
There's no business in it, Concezio.
The cops. They can be all over us.
Forget the cops.
What about these Saints fuckers?
These guys were long gone,
and now you're trying to bring the devil
right back to our doorstep?
Eight years ago,
these vigilante fucks
put my father on his knees
in public.
a blood relative
and benedictator to all of you.
You think that l don't know
that each one of you
has been waking up with the night sweats
over this for eight years?
These sons of bitches prison-fucked us!
ln the ass!
And then they wiped their dicks
on our grandma's drapes!
And we have been living in silent fear
ever since.
We don't talk about it.
Rape victims seldom do.
Concezio is right.
Pretending you don't got a problem
don't solve nothing.
Let's take a moment
and look at the serendiculous.. .
Seren.. . Seren.. . Seren.. .
Serendipitous.
...type situation we find ourselves in.
There's a wicked good chance
that these Saints are gonna show.
And this time,
they don't catch us with our pants down.
This time, we deal with them
proactiviously, huh?
And don't forget Boston's finest.
With their second bite at the apple
they've got every reason in the world
to crank up the heat.
And as for the Saints' doting fans,
fuck them!
Bad luck.
How would he even recognize us?
You don't remember the fucking sketches
on the news channel?
-Shit, that's right.
-Fuck's sake.
You know,
every time you see those composites on TV
and they catch the guy,
it looks nothing like him.
-But ours.. .
-Just our luck, right?
We draw Leonardo fucking da Vinci
as a sketch artist.
And two days ago,
we looked like Jesus Christ.
-What the fuck we cut our hair for?
-Yeah, that's right.
l don't know, it seemed like the thing to do
at the time, though, didn't it?
-Maybe we should dye it.
-What?
Well, they're always dying their hair
in the movies, like
lt's covert and shit.
What color would you dye it?
Lighter, l guess.
-Do you mean blonde?
-l didn't fucking say that.
Like California surfer boy.
-lt's not what l'm saying.
-Like gay, gay, gay,
-faggoty blonde.
-l'm fucking warning you!
-''Stay gold, Ponyboy!''
-l'm fucking warning you!
-''Stay gold.. .' '
-Fuck you!
You fucking cunt!
Jesus fucking Christ!
-Well, l was fucking mad!
-Shit!
What kind of fucking crazy.. .
-l know who you are. You guys are.. .
-Shut it!
This is so fucking cool, man!
l'm from Boston and l love you guys.
Shit, everybody loves you guys.
Maybe l can get on this thing.
You know, bring some  into this.
Hey, is it true that you guys say a prayer
before you grease somebody?
And an awesome wailing
was heard throughout heaven.
And the terrible hand of the Lord
struck upon the Earth.
And as Almighty God created you,
now he calleth you home!
Busy signal. Will have to call us back.
Let's have a shot while we're waiting.
-l think he took a little piss.
-That shit was not funny!
lt just came out me fucking nose.
Thank you, Jesus.
Thought l greased my drawers.
No.
l've got connects all over Beantown, man.
Romeo will hook you up like a tow truck.
-No.
-Why not?
We don't have to give you fucking reasons.
Forget it.
lt's because l'm Mexican, isn't it?
How dare you, sir, insinuate such a thing?
The fact that you're a greasy spic,
it's got nothing to do with it.
Okay, l'm gonna let you have that one,
but, look, l can do this.
This isn't rocket surgery.
You guys find the bad guys
doing bad stuff and you kill them, right?
Well, it's not that simple, actually.
-Yes, it is.
-Suppose you're right.
l was just hoping that we was
a bit more artistic about it, l think.
Yeah? Well, you ain't.
Now, what do you plan on doing
when you get to US soil?
We don't really have, you know,
a succinct plan yet, you know, per se.
Haven't really worked it all out, as it were.
As it were. Not fully developed, per se.
You two leprechaun dicks need to chill
in the greenroom
sipping on some Pellegrino
and let your manager handle the details.
And you'd better have
my Cub Scout badge ready.
Because if you wanna kick Yakavetta
in the nuts,
have him wake up
with a horse head in his bed,
Romeo's got an ace in the hole for you.
And that's all she wrote.
Everything points in the same direction.
Get out.
Look, l have been stonewalling
the media on this thing.
l've got half of New England
thinking the Saints whacked the priest
and the other half thinking they're innocent.
lt's a powder keg.
And we're talking riot gear
at Celtics games here.
Now, l can clear them of this murder
and take the piss right out of this thing.
Now, give me one reason
why l shouldn't take this public right now.
Walk with me, Chief. Let's talk.
This is not good.
She's gunning for the boys hard.
This broad trying to put a feather in her cap
is gonna get us all locked up.
-l mean, this couldn't be going any worse.
-Just calm down.
Calm down? Calm down? You know
they're gonna throw us in the Hoag.
We put half those deranged sex freaks
in there.
l hope you guys like cock sandwiches,
because we'll be eating them for breakfast,
lunch and dinner!
Now, l understand
you've got a job to do, Chief.
But this pint-sized killer is the only thing
that puts Yakavetta
right in the middle of this.
And if Concezio even sniffs
that we on to him,
he puts a bullet in Napoleon's head,
plants him at the bottom of the ocean
and walks.
Now it is imperative
that we find this little man.
You have said some dumb shit in your days,
but that.. . l.. . You know, that.. . That.. .
What? We're all ''assuming''
Smecker didn't tell her.
''Oh, yeah, by the way,
me and three Boston detectives
''are accessories to murder.
Pass the malt vinegar.' '
Smecker may have been a lot of things,
but he was a stand-up guy.
-And we took an oath. The four of us!
-Yeah!
-Okay! l was just thinking.
-Well, don't do that.
-You're no good at it.
-Fuck you!
You're as dumb as a fucking heel,
-you know that, you blowjob?
-Fucking, cocksucking, hard-on.. .
Jesus Christ! Look!
We need to figure out what we're gonna do
when the boys show
and start doing what they do best.
Because that's when the shit's
really gonna hit the fan!
But everyone is assuming
that the boys are gonna turn up.
We got no way of knowing that for sure.
Yeah, that could totally happen.
They could not come back.
What dream world did you two
just slip into?
We know the boys.
ls there any part of you
that thinks they're just gonna let this slide?
Believe this.
They're either on their way
or they're already here.
l thought you said your car
was inconspicuous.
Yeah, well, l don't like words
with ''spic'' right in the middle.
Besides, it is where l live.
Yeah? Where's that? Margaritaville?
Hey, l hail from a colorful people.
Besides, you wouldn't know style
if it pitched a tent in your ass.
Ace in the hole time.
Been a lot of chatter about Yakavetta
being in bed with the Chinese.
This here is little Yaka's
All right, here's the plan.
Then we skin out,
we go to Doc's for a shot of lrish,
we're at home in time for tacos.
That's what we do.
-What?
-Well, it's just this plan.. .
-What the fuck's wrong with the plan?
-lt's.. .
lt's genius. l can even drive an f-lift, man.
-Got my Class D license and everything.
-That's the fucking spirit!
l'm gonna need a gun.
-Forget it.
-Forget it.
What the fuck, man? l'm in on this shit.
l'm working here!
-Okay.
-For fuck's sake!
Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna consider yourself
a fucking pledge until we tell you different.
Can l consider myself your girlfriend, too?
That's what you get.
ls there a fucking problem?
lt's fine.
l'm fucking watching you.
You understand me?
Now, you stow that shit.
Don't you worry, Rome.
Shit like this, it builds character.
Yeah, the character of a little bitch.
Now, that's just unprofessional.
So, what do you think?
l think Yakavetta killed a good man
just to send us a message.
Well, let's send him one right back.
-Why?
-l don't know.
lt's not them.
lt's them.
A wise man once told me,
''Where a man's actions are firmly bound
to an unshakable faith,
''one's worst nightmares become sudden,
terrifying reality.' '
You didn't have to bash me in the skull!
Sorry, man, we got a plan going here.
Technically, l was supposed
to knock you out.
But they gave me this faggoty little gun,
see, and the weight's just not.. .
Christ, that's a gun?
Why didn't you just point it at me
and say ''scram''?
-Scram! Get the fuck out of here! Now!
-You got it!
Hey, guys, let's not let this one little incident
get in the way of.. .
Shut up
and get back behind the fucking wheel!
-Jeez!
-Well,
-at least your plan's off to a winning start.
-Go fuck yourself.
Oh, fuck.
That's heroin.
-How the fuck would you know?
-Fuck you. l know shit.
What's the symbolism here?
-Symbolism?
-Yeah. What does this symbolize?
Well, it symbolizes a huge fuck-up.
This is a plan that fell to pieces.
A lot of it don't make sense,
which is why it all makes perfect sense.
-Christ, what the fuck's he doing?
-l don't know. Hang on!
Fuck's sake.
All right, all right.
Christ, he can't fucking see
where he's going!
Shit! Turn to the left now! Tell him!
-Go left! Go left!
-What?
-That way! Go that way!
-Left? Fuck!
l can't believe l let you talk me into this.
Fucking stupid plan.
lt's all in the execution.
And your negative attitude ain't helping any!
-What? What the fuck?
-Negative attitude?
-My fucking negative attitude?
-Yeah, your negative attitude!
You've got to visualize the end result!
You've got to force it into reality! Believe!
You've got to fucking believe!
l'm about to believe my fist
right up your fucking ass!
You'll do what?
-Not a believer!
-That's another thing,
don't be down at me,
'cause l'm right fucking there, man!
You've got to believe!
This bitch is fast-a-rooney.
Wait.
-Wait. Wait, wait, hold on.
-Uppey-downey!
Shit!
Boys, l believe things in our fair, little city
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
And shepherds we shall be,
for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand,
that our feet may swiftly carry out
Thy command.
So we shall flow a river forth to Thee
and teeming with souls shall it ever be.
Ballistics just dug it out.
A.22? You've got to be kidding me.
That's like bringing a knife to a gunfight.
Yeah, or like bringing a really small gun
to a gunfight.
l don't know.
Ballistics is reading three shooters,
and this is one of them.
l find it hard to believe that one of the three
most lethal individuals on the planet
just switched over to birdshot.
Maybe we're reading this wrong.
Priest was a frame job, right?
Yeah, maybe somebody's trying
to eliminate some competition here?
Yeah.
No, sir, it's them.
Here he comes.
-Doc!
-Doc!
Boys!
You're a sight for sore eyes.
Come on in here with that. Get in quick.
Get in out of the cold. Come on.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
l saw the news channel.
-Are you boys all right?
-Sound as an lrish pound, Doc.
-ls it too late for a shot?
-The Lord told me you'd be coming.
''Doc,'' he said. ''They'd be coming.' '
And l was to have everything ready.
And l have. l have everything.. .
lt's all set.
This is our Mexican.
Nice to meet you, lad. They call me.. .
Fuck! Ass!
How you doing, Fuck Ass? l'm Romeo.
This used to be a speakeasy in the '40s.
l only use it for storage now.
-Holy shit.
-Holy shit.
-This is so fucking cool!
-Nobody knows it's up here. You'll be safe.
You can get in and out the fire escape.
Know what this is? This is our hideout.
We got a fucking hideout, man!
What, are you fucking five years old?
You know, Rome,
we got sticks and blankets.
You can make yourself a fort.
Fuck the both of you, man.
This is fucking sweet.
We even got pinball machines, man.
Lobster dick! Look at me! Lobster dick!
Not this time, you little shit.
We'll see about that, old man.
Would somebody
please come over here and.. .
-Fuck!
-Me up the.. .
-Ass!
-Yes! That's what he done!
That's what he's done every time!
l took you down, old man, l took you down!
Are you hungry, lad?
l sent Louie out for some sandwiches.
l could eat.
Decent work.
Do you know what l'm thinking
would be a nice match for the back?
That chocolate hide with the heavy marbling
we've been trying to get rid of
for the last six months.
We'll make a leather man
out of you yet, son.
Go to it, lad.
l can't help you with that, lads.
But if you need something, anything,
made out of leather,
we'd be happy to do the job.
How many times have l been nice to you?
How many times do my people come here
and talk to you?
This song and dance is over.
lt's over, motherfucker!
You didn't see anything!
Noah!
No, no, no. No, no, no, no!
We got to call the  Noah!
We got to call somebody.
Noah! No.
You young guys worry too much.
We always bounce back.
Besides, better the chinks than us, right?
This is some serious shit here!
Something amusing you, queer bait?
-No, l was just.. .
-You should be focused on the next step!
That shipment of H was gonna
square our books for the next six months!
-Any thoughts on that?
-Yeah, l got some thoughts on that.
l was just thinking,
not too serendipitous for us.
You.. .
lt's like the Roman Empire in here.
You even got concubines and shit.
-George. What gives here?
-A little cannoli, shrimp cocktail, huh?
l need to see the boss, right away.
Jimmy the Gofer,
Hey, boss, l just came by to tell you.. .
Hello, can you hear me? Over.
Copy that. Everything's in motion.
All our guys
are gunning for these Jesus freaks.
l figure there's no need for me to be
on the streets no more.
So, which one of these rooms
do you want me to take, huh?
-l was.. .
veterano.
Yakavetta's gunning for you
and hard.
Even posted a reward,
like Jesse James-style shit.
Anyway, any of his guys that take you out
gets his palm crossed.
Two hundred and fifty big ones.
Quarter mil for us?
''Us''? What are you talking about, ''us''?
Uncle, why do you disrespect me
in front of my friends?
l'm disrespecting you?
A year ago
you were washing my pots and pans.
Well, l don't wash
fucking pots and pans anymore.
l'm a part of this Uncle.
Nephew, this is not my first barbeque.
He's with us.
ls he?
And is my nephew here
pulling his own weight?
A lot of heart.
Gorgeous George is running
the show right now for little Yaka.
And if anyone knows where he is,
it's that fat, fucking ugly
l'll get it out on the wire.
Anybody hungry?
-Maybe we should stop at an lHOP or.. .
-Shut up!
Romeo's crying.
Fucking assholes!
Shut up!
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that feels good.
Somebody had their Wheaties this morning.
Yeah, get after it, girl.
Oh, that's good.
Hey, let's keep this professional, baby.
No offense,
but l don't need you calling me all the time.
What the fuck!
l'll kill you, you fucking bitch!
What the fuck did you just say to me?
l'm sorry l called you that.
How courteous of you to apologize.
Courtesy is so important, don't you agree?
Yeah. Yeah, l'm down with that.
Good. Now sit your fat ass down.
Where is Concezio Yakavetta?
-l don't know.
-Yeah, there's a lot you don't know, hoss.
For instance,
you're the only New York guy, George.
Your blood just ain't quite as blue
as the rest of them, is it?
Explains why you ain't safely tucked away
in some ivory tower
with the rest of them bigwigs sucking on
cannoli and cocktail shrimp right now.
That's why you're the one
he left on the streets, George.
Like you know shit all of a sudden.
Somebody's got to run
our legitimate businesses.
-Somebody's got to be out there making.. .
-Someone's got to chum the waters.
Bullshit! And l ain't saying
another fucking word to you!
Good. You can just listen.
We know Concezio had that priest killed.
That's another thing you don't know,
l reckon.
But then why would he tell you
that, George?
You and your boys on the street,
y'all is bait.
Gorgeous George, huh?
Expendable George is more like it.
By the by, you've got a pretty nice ass
for a fat man.
A priest. Sick fuck, huh?
So, until the Saints get popped,
we're all lambs to the slaughter.
And he don't care how many of us
they wipe out in the meantime.
What do you need me to do, Skip?
-Down the
-What, everyone?
North and South?
That could get a little dicey.
-Fuck their old grudges! They're all in this!
-Grudges have nothing to do with it.
-You know l don't take sides.
-l don't care, Jo Jo!
-You know l don't.
-You don't take sides?
-Never me! Never me!
-You don't take sides?
You're gonna take my fucking side
on this, Jo Jo!
-You talk to that mick Jimmy Green.
-Here we go again.
-Jimmy'll tell you that!
-Jimmy Green! Jimmy Green!
l don't care if Jimmy Green hollowed out
your sister like a Chippewa lndian!
You're gonna get in there, Jo Jo,
and you're gonna middle-of-the-road
this fucking thing for me,
and you're not gonna fuck it up!
You tell them everything that we discussed!
Even the panic room thing?
Sure.
Good. Because that's a nice icebreaker.
They'll like that.
You know,
l didn't even know those things were real.
l thought they made that up for that movie.
Remember the one
with the broad and the kid?
The guys in the house?
-No, the other one.
-Stop fucking around!
This is serious shit here, Jo Jo!
You tell them we meet tomorrow night.
-All right.
-l'll call you with the fucking location.
-Okay.
-Fucking thing.
Come on, kid. lt was a fucking.. .
lt was a fucking accident.
We can work this out.
He ain't gonna do shit.
You're ltalian Kid.
Help us out here.
Think it over.
l am his friend.
Fuck him and fuck his friend.
Deal the cards! He ain't got the balls.
What did we do?
Connor.
God! No!
Why did they use his mug shot?
What? No.
Yeah, you remember
when he said he was all embarrassed
because that fellow had to hold up
all his long hair behind his head?
Aye.
That's an arm.
Hey, Rocco!
mijo.
The place is called
Tando's Tanning Salon on Bunker Hill.
That's where the fucking
gets his fake bake at.
European cut. Far superior.
Lovely singing voice there, Georgie.
We'd like you to sing for us.
Can you do that for me?
Can you do that for me?
lt's getting hard to be a gentleman
of fucking leisure around here!
l want the name of the shooter
you motherfuckers used on that priest!
What priest?
His fucking name!
-l don't know who it is!
-That's fucking bullshit!
lt's the truth! Concezio didn't tell nobody
what he was doing
'cause he knew
nobody would have okayed it!
The shooter's an independent contractor!
That's all l fucking know!
Where the fuck is Yakavetta hiding?
Prudential Building, 40th floor.
Jesus Christ!
You meeting someone tonight?
Yakavetta's racket chiefs. Street guys.
Your kind of guys.
You could take a real bite out of crime here.
-And l can help you.
-What the fuck is that?
Nobody forgot
what you guys did to us last time.
Everybody's hiding indoors.
They give out the location an hour before.
My uncle's place is closed tonight.
l got the key.
How does Mexican work for you, George?
Do you like that?
Doesn't matter to me.
l think l just shit my European-cut Speedos.
-What's this?
-Rosary bead.
Found it pushed under the carpet
near the victim.
Father McKinney wasn't wearing a rosary,
so it's probably been there a while.
The results on all 864 prints
found at the scene.
All matched churchgoers and clergy but one.
Partial on the priest's watch
is still unidentified.
No. No, that's horseshit.
Everybody gets printed nowadays.
They even are inking up these snot gobblers
in kindergarten now.
lt's a brick wall anyway.
We know Napoleon was wearing gloves.
The lab got zilch on the lock and chain.
Even the pennies came up clean.
l'm gonna go powder my nose.
Man. Daddy would knock that out
like Mike fucking Tyson.
-Hey!
-What? l didn't say nothing.
McKinney wore his watch on his left wrist.
Where was this found exactly?
Right here, off his left elbow.
Just occurred to me that priests
wear the rosary while taking confession.
-She's right.
-Dolly, get on the phone
and find out which wrist
he wore his rosary on.
Duffy, push that partial through the DMV.
David, you put it through lnterpol
just to get an lD now.
Come on, vamoose!
You took your gloves off,
didn't you, cowboy?
Now why would you go
and do a damn fool thing like that?
Just two more to go.
You guys are gonna let me go, right?
l guess we'll just have to wait and see,
won't we?
Jesus Christ, this is some embarrassing shit.
Don't worry. We worked on a sheep farm.
Smelled way worse.
Although that is right up there.
Yo, spicaroo.
More nachos and
Hey, and l need a refill here, pepe.
Easy! Jesus!
-How do, David?
-Hey!
''Silver Peso.' '
lt's a Mexican joint down by the docks.
Sent it to his enforcer, Jo Jo Rhama.
Guess gangsters got to eat, too, huh?
l think l'll drop in on their little supper,
see if l can shake things up a bit.
Need a bodyguard?
No, thank you, Mike Tyson. Bye, now.
Bye.
These dagos are getting antsy, man.
l'm getting spicarooed and pepe'd.
All right, calm the fuck down.
You got to stick it out.
Just wait on one more.
He is not with them.
lt is only the sons.
They have a Spaniard with them.
They will slaughter everyone.
Let them.
lf you kill the sons.. .
...the father will come.
Gentlemen.
All right. The gang's all here.
Give me my fucking BB gun.
No, Rome. You've earned your stripes.
Hey, tighten it up.
So?
Where's Gorgeous?
ls that George?
What the fuck is that?
lt's lrish for, ''You're fucked.' '
bitches!
l've seen the light!
You guys have really turned me around
on this. l'm, like, born again and shit!
Should we let him go?
You know what l think we should do?
l think we should let God decide
if he gets a second chance.
What the fuck you doing?
What the.. . No, man, come on.
Hey, what the fuck you gonna do?
You had best be right with your Jesus, boy.
Well! Praise be to Jesus!
-Georgie.
-Yeah?
You know all good boys go to heaven.
You know, that was perhaps one of
the finest examples of spiritual guidance
-l've ever had the good fortune to witness.
-lt was wonderful, wasn't it?
Mysterious ways, l tell you, mysterious ways.
You know, it's about time
one of your fucking plans.. .
