TWO YEARS LATER
- Cool hat.
- Thanks .
- Give it back.
- Are you scared?
- I said : give it back.
- You want it? Come get it!
What you gonna do about it?
Cry?
Go on, cry.
- I asked you twice.
- Twice what, loser?
I asked twice.
Yeah, if you're gonna take the job you might as well do it right.
There's all kind of wood you can get here.
You got virgin Cypress, you got, you got long leaf pine.
You got that punctured treated pine, well that's my favourite one.
Now if anybody wanna use the cheapest shit they can find,
might as well buy that shit from IKEA.
Look at this.
Mites done ate all through it.
Wonder why you gotta do the job again every two years.
- Look at this.
- Hello?
- Be right there.
- Something wrong?
Something at Maddy's school.
- You okay to finish?
- Damn man, I'm working with you, not for you bro.
- Hey Broker, don't sweat it, it's probably nothing.
- Yeah, you could be right.
I don't feel calm, so why the hell should I stay calm?
No, it's making no logical damn sense.
Now I want this thing settled, and I mean now.
- Don't get yourself all wound up like this honey.
- Who is that? Do you know him?
Do you know him ?
Is that the father of that goddamn little girl?
Are you the father?
- Mr. Broker?
- What happened?
Maddy 's fine. She is in the classroom.
Come with me.
I want to see my boy .
Teddy, baby, are you okay?
Does it hurt?
He's got blood all over his goddamn new shirt Jimmy.
That's why you gotta watch these sneaky little bitches in playgrounds..
Hey? Hey? Hey What? Huh?
Hey what? You wanna say something to me?
- I would just let them leave the building.
- Why is the sheriff there?
For Cassie Bodine .
Last time we had to see him with Cassie she threatened the principal.
Their son is a special needs case.
- By the way, I'm Susan Hetch , the school psychologist.
- Phil Broker.
Listen, you've got a great girl.
You allright?
- What happened ?
- I warned him two times like I was supposed to.
Schoolyard monitor sais she saw Maddy hit Teddy pretty hard.
She knew what she was doing.
- He started it, he's a bully.
- Maddy, come on.
Maybe this is my fault.
I taught her to defend herself.
- You think it's good teaching your little girl how to fight?
- No.
Defend herself though, yeah.
Hey Maddy, do you mind waiting in the hall for just a minute?
- Yes , ma'am.
- Thank you.
So why did you guys move up here?
It's a little remote for most people.
She wanted a horse.
Maddy 's mother grew up around here, so.
It would be a good place
to start rebuilding .
Her file sais that your wife died fairly recently.
- Last year .
- Yeah, it's been hard on her.
Her mom was sick for a while.
Anything else?
- Why is he picking on me?
- He picks on you because he thinks you're different.
- But I'm not different.
- Well to him you are.
And nothing is happening about it.
So this guy here keeps walking along.
- Nothing happening there! Do it!
- All right!
- Hey Broker!
- Stand by the car.
- What's wrong?
- Go stand by the car.
- Don't take any shit , Jimmy.
Jimmy, back in the truck please.
- You owe my son a goddamn apology.
- Take it easy.
- Jimmy, back in the truck please.
- Some sneaky little bitch cheap shots my son,
somebody owes us a goddamn apology.
- That's goddamn right!
Don't go there. Please, don't go there.
Get in the truck please , honey.
- Don't turn your back on me.
- Honey, baby, get in the truck.
Get him Jimmy. Get him Jimmy!
- Arrest him!
Keith, protect him!
What the fuck are you doing?
- Get this motherfucker outta here!
- Move away.
- Goddamned, what are you doing?
Keith, what the fuck are you doing?
- Cassie, shut up.
- You gonna let him get away with that?
- It's OK, get in the truck.
- It doesn't look OK.
- It's OK.
- In the truck.
- Do something, will ya?
Breathe , Jimmy. Jesus Christ.
Yes , mosy on over.
- Am I in trouble here?
- No I saw what happened. He was outta line.
You really had to take him down that hard though?
You passed the man in front of his child, Mr. Broker.
Is she allright?
Are you allright?
So you moved into the old Griffin place a while back?
- What do you do ?- What are you doing to keep busy around here?
- Is there a reason you're asking these questions?
Well, maybe I'm just being friendly.
Or maybe I'm bored or maybe I'm curious.
Or whatever. It doesn't matter.
- It's my right to ask.
- Things got outta hand sherrif, it won't happen again.
Daddy, there's a bunch of teachers watching us right now.
- You're a pussy.
- What?
I said you are a motherfucking pussy.
That's what you are.
You let him make fools out of all of us, in front of everybody.
- After half an hour the whole fucking town will know .
- I've lost my godd...
- What Jimmy? You lost what?
- I've lost my balance.
- Fucking lost your balance. He spun you drunk, you were on your ass.
- Momma, don't curse.
- Dad tripped just like me.
- What's the plan, Jimmy?
Right now nothing.
We still got Keith on our tail.
Fuck Keith.
How did he buy that new truck?
That's what I wanna know. How did he buy that new truck?
- Who?
- Who? Fucking who?
Him, motherfucker who put you down.
You forgettin' him?
My god he put you down so hard.
- I gotta see my brother.
- Let's just keep this a familly matter, Cas.
What do you call him?
Yeah, now you're acting all big. Fucking idiot.
Good afternoon. Little tweaker birds. Kicking up some shit.
Why don't you turn that music off?
Turn that fucking music off!
Hey, how old are you ?
- Allright go on. Get outta here.
- Are you coming...?
- They ain't coming. Get the fuck outta here!
As for you guys ...
My name is Gator Bodine.
I hope I didn't hurt you too badly, sir?
I just wanted you to get a little taste of what's
gonna happen to you
if you keep cooking this illegal
substance in my neck of the woods.
Look man, we mean no disrespect.
This here is just for us, you know...
I don't doubt it. Just fun.
Kids having fun.
Enjoying life.
Celebrate.
Well, I'ma warn you.
I've got a 5 gallon can of gasoline out in my truck
that I will happily pour down your fucking throats.
If I ever catch you cooking and stinking up my town again.
Stop!
Now listen up.
I don't wanna have to kill a bunch of little kids.
You will stand up and run in any direction you please,
just not this one.
Is that clear?
Allright, now get the fuck outta here!
Go! Run! Run!
Piece a shit kindergarten operation.
Fucking kids stuff.
How are the knuckles, bruiser?
- Feels fine now daddy.
- Watch out, here comes Maddie Mad Fists.
- Dad!Really?
Listen...
I'm proud you stood up for yourself.
You set boundaries with this kid.
Sounds like a motorhome. Is he snoring?
- Dad? - Yeah?
- Were you scared today?
- The truth.
- There's nothing wrong with being a little scared.
- Then why didn't you look scared?
- That's a practice.
- Night , Luthor.
- Dad?
- Yes?
- What do you think of Mrs. Hetch?
- She's... I'd say she's allright.
- You know what I mean.
- Yes . I know exactly what you mean.
- Good night.
Shit!
- You need to cool down.
- I need to cool down?
You think we're gonna be disrespected by some son of a bitch?
I ain't sayin'...
But putting your old man on the ground that ain't no  big thing.
- When he was talking to Keith...
- What the fuck? The sherrif was there?
I heard him say he was living at the old Griffin place.
- Fuck.
- You wanna do some things?
- What things?
- Mess with their heads, like you do everyone else.
Hey boss, are we good for tonight?
I'll talk to you two in a minute allright?
Good to see you again Cassie.
- What the hell is wrong with those two?
- Nevermind.
Fucking monkeys is what they are..
- Hey, you look a little jumpy.
- I know.
I need something.
Stop my stomach.
Want me to beg?
No.
You know, if I can control, you can control.
- I'll handle that broker thing.
- Thank you.
Planning kids birthday parties,
it's my specialty.
- I'd be happy to take care of it for her.
- Thanks.
I'm not very good with these things.
Don't worry, I'm on it, it'll be fine.
She really likes you Susan.
That's a bit of a milestone I'd say.
- You think you can talk to her sometime?
- Of course.
Maddy used to talk to her mom for hours.
- I think she'd like to talk to a woman more often.
- I'd be happy to.
- Thanks.
- One more thing..
- People around here can say some foolish things.
- Meaning?
It's a bit like Apalachia.
Like feuds, they still exist.
And you 're new here .
So I just think it would be best for Maddy
if you would smooth everything over while still fresh in peoples minds.
These two kids were in a fistfight.
You could go from two kids in a fistfight
to the emergency room that fast.
I didn't know this town had an emergency room.
Now you're catching on.
Look, people talk.
They decided you're a question mark.
Keep it smooth, check.
You want something around here?
I don't think so.
Look... What happened there...
I don't want more trouble.
Your kid  made the trouble.
Not ours, yours.
What do I need to do to make this go away Jimmy?
You?
I want an apology. Full apology.
I want you to apologize to my wife cause it's what's right
and my kid too. He saw the whole damn thing.
- I apologize for what happened.
- To them too.
To them too.
We're good now Jimmy?
Yeah allright. Go on.
It's good enough.
Go and pump your own chef, I'll be with ya in a minute.
Goddamn mother freezer!
There he is.
Let's go and get this piece a shit.
Hey neighbour, how ya doing?
- Can I get that pump?
- I'm almost done.
See I need the goddamn pump right now.
You hear me?
- Can I help y'all out hereyou ?
- No, we don't need your help.
He's done.
- That's 12.84 sir
- I wasn't done yet.
I think you are.
Whatever you're thinking, rethink it.
Rethink it. He wants me to rethink it.
You ain't turning that back on.
Shit.
You fucked up.
Why don't we stop on to the other side of the building
so I can kick your fucking ass up on over your shoulders.
- They from around here?
- I ain't never seen them.
Who put you up to this?
Nobody.
Bring that over.
Down the tubes.
Yes ?
Fuck! How the fuck did that happen?
His fucking kid goes to my fucking nephews school.
I don't fucking know!
I'll deal with it. Fuck.
Daddy, what happened to your hand?
- Right there.
- Oh yeah... Uh...
Me and Teedo were trying to pull that
rusty old fence out of the ground.
You know the one behind the stable?
We won though.
Afternoon.
Mind stepping out for a minute?
You can stay in there little girl,
this won't take too long.
Is there a problem , sheriff?
Well, I got a report of an altercation at the filling station.
You know anything about that?
Anybody pressing charges?
- No, nobody's pressing any charges.
- Then there's nothing worth talking about.
What are you, son?
Former military ?
Former military , ex law enforcment? Ex what?
Well, if I were ex-military sherrif,
I'd probably refer to the answer as
"need to know information".
And maybe some people don't need to know.
Here's what you need to know Broker.
You've got my attention son.
Get that hand looked after.
Are you gonna leave me behind today?
I think so .
- Making new friends at school?
- Yeah, making a lot of friends.
- I learned some cool stuff in science class.
Did you know that the trees along the river  are called cypress
-  And they can grow like a 100 feet.
- That's cool.
- Not as cool as snakes.
- Snakes?
Yeah. We got Mocassins, Copperheads, Diamondbacks...
- No King Cobras, right?
Dad, no. King Cobras are like in the Far East.
That's a relief.
- Dad?
- Yeah?
- Why did we move out here?
- Because there are no King Cobras .
Come on. Look at me.
Beautiful house, horse trails, river in our backyard.
Seriously, what else could we ask for?
WiFi.
- WiFi?
- Yeah.
Anyone home?
The door is open.
Neighbour calling.
That was a tie.
Maybe.
Do you know "Grace"?
- She new friend from school ?
- A new word I got from class.
"Grace".Yeah, that's a good one.
I think mom had that.
You have a good memory, Maddy.
She did.
The way she dressed , her smile ...
Everything about her.
- I miss mom.
- Me too.
I miss her so much my stomach hurts.
I get this feeling that she's worried about you.
And that she wants you to be happy.
If you're here , I'm happy.
What else could I be?
- Wanna catch up?
- I find myself always trying to do that.
Luther!
Easy, boy. Easy.
Easy.
Dad?
DAD!
- Have you seen Luther?
- Luther?
- No, sweetie.
- I, I don't hear his bell. I'll go look.
Go back inside.
You should be getting ready for bed.
Don't worry, I'll find him.
Go.
- Dad, you know I can't sleep without Luther.
- I know. But I need you to try, OK?
- I'll find him.
- And you'll find Bonnie too?
Yes. I'll find them both.
It'll be OK.
Luther!
Luther!
Phil Broker.
Motherfucker.
Nice hair.
For a few years, part of the gang known as the "Outcasts".
Motorcycle gang led by Danny Turre.
Holy shit.
Broker.
Very nice to meet you , agent Broker.
Luther!
Luther!
Come!
- Yeah?
- I think I got something big for us.
Big like what?
Just get over here, as soon as possible.
My shift doesn't end for another three hours,
and I've got to drive from Shreveport.
Allright allright allright. Just make it first thing in the morning, OK?
Everything is changing.
Remember Jojo? Jojo Turri?
Danny T's boy?
Of course I do.
- The kid was batshit.
- He was.
Until he got shot by the police 47 times.
Losing your only kid like that...
I hear Danny T is still pretty fucked up about it.
Well, they never did catch whoever snithed on Jojo and Danny T.
- And?
- Cause it wasn't just a snitch. It was a goddamn undercover cop.
Read.
That guy Broker.
He's the snitch they didn't want showing up in the courtroom.
MC Dalton...that's his snitch name.
- A state narc's living in Rayville?
- Relax. Relax!
The thing is he's just living low here, with his daughter.
Trust me, this is our shot.
- Hey, how are you doing there Broker?
- Turn that off?
Cut the bullshit.
Get right to it.
Some smalltime had him some crack, going back and forth.
Know anything about it?
- I don't know what the hell you talking about.
- This fucking amusing to you clum? You think it's fucking funny?
You got your apology.
Me and my little girl are gonna be left alone in peace.
Don't escalate this any more.
- And clum, I wan't my kids cat back.
- Cat?
- I know nothing about no cat.
- Today.
Nowhere near my place.
You understand me?
Good.
A lot of things have changed since you were last here.
Check it out. Got glassware, mantles,
generator, exhaust system.
Got it all going on.
Then why the fuck do we need Danny T?
We're gonna give him that rat fuck narc
in exchange for state wide distribution .
Yeah but Gator,
these  guys are fucking bikers, you can't trust them.
You're gonna give 'em this guy,
they're gonna turn around and they're gonna kill him.
- And then you got nothing.
- Look, this means no more small time jobs.
No more sweatin' middle man.
All we do is cook, and get paid.
- It's never that easy
- All you have to do
islearn a few lines and go talk to Danny T's lawyer.
- Like hell I am .
- You use them, Coming back all humble.
You're not asking for money.
You're giving Danny this guy as a gift.
- As a favor.
- Gator, that guy is a fucking pig .
Just trust me.
You're gonna get the negotiation of your life.
- Ready for the big day tomorrow?
- It's just a birthday .
Hey come on, it's the tenth anniversary. It's a special one.
I guess.
- Look what I found jumping around.
- Jumping around ?
Yes , jumping around.
Thanks.
It's nice.
I know it's noit as good as the original,
but I though she might fill in until we find Bunny.
You know, I was thinking,
you should have like a birthday party, with your class.
- Can Mrs. Hetch come?
- She's the one who planned it.
- My idea , of course.
- Thanks , dad.
Sheryl.
Sheryl Mott .
- Surprise, surprise surprise.
- You're not a hard man to find.
Old habits 'n all.
How you doin', Sheryl?
- What's up?
- I want you to look at something .
Like what? You got a new gang tattoo ...
- You wanna show me ?
- It's a little bit more important than that.
It's a gift. For Danny T.
You've got ten minutes.
- Hey, a gift?
-  She sais.
This guy killed my fuckin kid.
Please tell me, you kow where this motherfucker is.
- Guess what? Time to go.

Ms. Klum?

Uh yeah, I guess.
Cool.
- Teddy got some blood, on his shirt. You replacing it?
- Yeah I'm replacing it.
OK, guess that does it.
See you around Mrs. Klum.
So I heard something interesting.
Oh yeah? Something tells me you're gonna tell me what that is.
Oh just that Jimmy Klum got his ass kicked.
So did his kid.
Fascinating. Where did you hear that?
Well I shoot enough pool and drink enough beer in town.
You hear a lil' bit of everything Broker.
By the way that's old news.
We shook and made up.
Is that what you think?
I got some new news for you.
People around here dont shake and make up.
Never goes away that easy.
It's old school in a feudan sense around here
Yeah, someone broke into our house.
Is that old school?
Yeah it is, that's called payback.
Somebody trying to scare your ass outta here, thats all. You'll be alright.
- Jimmy Klum you mean?
- Fuck no Jimmy Klum's a bitch.
Listen I know everybody around here and Jimmy Klum's bitch ass ain't breakin into shit.
- Now his wife brother's a whole different story.
- Who's his wifes brother?
They call him Gator for some dumb ass reason.
Lives down by the Rayville water share.
Fronts as a boat mechanic.
Can't fix shit.
But the word is he's cooking up that meth.
Hey if I were you I'd be real careful around him Broker.
He ain't true you hear me?
The sherrif know about him?
Know about him?
Man he and sherrif Keith got it all figured out.
You see Gator snitches for Keith.
He throws him all the small fish,
makes his job easy.
In turn the sherrif looks the other direction whenever Gator wanna cook.
It's some bullshit.
- Yeah thanks for the history lesson.
- Listen I grew up around these rednecks
and I think you ought to know who you're fucking with.
Oh and in case you got any interest,
Gator eats breakfast nearly every day at Layma's cafe, just like me.
Now he dont look like much of nothing, but remember what I told u :
he ain't true.
Crazy waiting to happen.
- Hey where are you?
- They set the meet at this fucking coffee shack at Creek Roads.
- You know I'm allergic to ths shit right?
Just get it done alright Sheryl.
Look at the guy they're sending, Cyrus Hanks.
Are you fucking kiddin' me?
I know him. He's a fucking animal Gator.
- He's a fucking stone cold killer.
- Don't worry about any of that, just make it happen.
Look at you.
- Nice place Cyrus.
- Yeah well, lets just say I'm comfortble around fat people.
They eat the way gamblers play the slots.
They're fucking oblivious to everything around them.
Plus I love these fucking things.
You hungry?
No, I'm fine.
Sweetheart?
Black coffee with a little honey.
So what's it gonna take to find this rat fuck? You know where he is yeah?
- Him and his kid.
- And to get him? You want what exactly?
I don't want anything. He's a narc, he's a gift.
Oh hes a gift? He's a gift.
Since when does a meth whore give away gifts?
I spend the last couple of years putting togther the right equipment,
perfect partner, perfect location.
All we need is distribution, that's the main thing we're after.
Well you got me fucking fooled Sheryl.
Cause underneath this beautiful tweaker body,
you're a fucking genius.
- Where's the narc?
- Do we have a deal?
- Where is the narc?
- Do we have a deal, Cyrus?
You got five seconds before I drill your fucking skull into this
table and then into the fucking floor, you understand?
Don't you fuck with me Sheryl.
Where is the fucking narc?
What are you doing?
- Cleaning.
- Cleaning?
It's filthy in there.
- I'm glad you noticed.
- What are you doing here?
I came to tell you that I dealt with Broker.
The girls father.
- I want you to stay away from him.
- Hey you got something for me?
Cassie, I'm trying to tell you something.
Do not go near Broker anymore.
- Got it.
- Okay.
- Wow. I'm not holding so I'm sorry, can't help you.
- Not holding.
- Well I think that's fucking bullshit.
- Cassie, why don't you just clean yourself up?
- That's fucking bullshit!
- Take a fucking shower and eat a sandwich or something.
You take a fucking shower Gator.
Look at you!
Cassie just pull yourself together.
I'm sick of this shit.
Teddy's sleeping, if you wake him up it's gonna be like...
This is gotta stop.
- Don't worry I'm not making a noise. I'm leaving.
No more.
We're done. No more Cassie.
- Hey yo Gator.
- How's it hanging man?
- What?
- Listen man, I need a favor.
- A favor?
Fuck Jimmy you know what I heard? Keeping garbage bins is gone.
Man I need you to stop giving that shit to my wife.
Alright look at her man. She's falling to pieces.
Maybe you should do a better job taking care of her.
- Were you sleeping?
- Like a baby.
- What you got?
- Gator Bodine. I sniffed around like you asked.
A couple of arrests, no convictions.
You want details?
- Nah don't bother.
- But there is something Broker.
Sheryl Marie Mott.
Ex biker cookie from Shreveport.
Busted twice for smuggling dope into Angola.
One of those times was to your old pal Danny T.
All of a sudden, Danny T's skank is hanging out in Rayville.
Randy. Randy send me a picture will you?
- Yeah first thing at my desk I'll email you Motts file.
- Thanks Randy.
So, this guy Cyrus. You know him?
- Yeah I know him.
- Did you fuck him?
Shit.
Fuck!
This should be interesting.
Yeah we've never been properly introduced, you and me.
- Is that what this is? An introduction?
- Yeah that's right.
Well I won't ask your name.
I personally believe a reputation is the most important thing.
For some people.
Yeah, maybe it should be for you too,
you've worked up a pretty bad reputation around here.
Beating up that poor kids father in front of him.
Pissed of some of the locals.
His daughter beat up Jimmy's kid, do you believe that?
Now what kind of parent would
teach a kid to do something like that?
- Look, I don't want anymore problems.
- OK.
Anythng else your thinking hard about,
cause I can smell the wood burning.
If someone has an issue with me, keep it there.
- I don't want my kid involved.
- Involved?
I'm a little lost.
Well, let's get you found.
You see the house?
The house where we're living.
The house that was broken into by some pathetic coward.
Who stole a lil' girls toys, a cat. Sliced the tires.
See that's my fucking house.
Anyone who comes around again, will find me standing in it.
OK.
Well, I thnk your reaching.
Connecting dots that are not there.
You're noticed Bodine.
You should tell your little girl to be brave.
She's got nothing to worry about with such a tough daddy around.
Nice meeting ya.
Finish your breakfast.
- Fuck, what are you doing Gator?
- Fuckers making it personal.
Yeah well, we're on.
It's happening tonight.
Luther!
Hey boy.
Put the kitty down. Get up really slow.
Luther!
Luther.
- Gotcha.

It's a tricky thing with this rebar.
Specially the 9 gauge.
You swing it too high, too fast, it takes your whole fucking head of man.
- It's a very delicate operation.
- You did alright though Lou.
Gator'd be pissed if we did something really fucking stupid.
He must be pissed of you two. Quite  a lot.
That's funny man. You're a funny guy Broker.
You're a really funny fucking guy.
