Captain.
What is it, Webb?
A blip, sir.Just
came on the screen.
How do you read it?
Aircraft of some sort.
By the size and speed,
it's not
one of ours.
It doesn't read like
anything I've ever seen.
What was the approach?
None, sir. It's just like
it fell out of the sky.
Current position?
Directly over the Omaha
installation. Holding there.
Watch the scope, Webb.
Air Defense will send
somebody up for a closer look.
We may have a real
U.F.O. on our hands.
Space--
The final frontier.
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.
Its five-year mission--
to explore
strange new worlds...
to seek out new life
and new civilizations...
to boldly go where
no man has gone before.
Captain 's log--
Stardate 3113.2.
We were enroute to
Starbase 9 for resupply
when a black star of
high-gravitational attraction
began to drag us
toward it.
It required all
warp power in reverse
to pull us away
from the star.
But, like
snapping a rubber band,
the break away sent us
plunging through space,
out of control,
to stop here...
wherever we are.
Mr. Spock.
Except for secondary systems,
everything is out, sir.
We're on
impulse power only.
Auxiliaries?
If Mr. Scott
is still with us,
auxiliaries should
be on momentarily.
Are you all right,
Lieutenant?
Mr. Scott
is still with us.
This is the captain.
Damage control parties
on all decks, check in.
All departments, tie-in
with the record computer.
Report casualties
and operational readiness
to the First Officer.
Kirk out.
Lieutenant Uhura,
contact
Starfleet Control.
I want them alerted to the position
of that black star
that's in the area
of Starbase 9.
Captain.
Casualty reports indicate
only minor injuries.
Engineering reports
warp engines nonoperational.
Mr. Scott overrode
the automatic helm setting.
He's holding us in orbit
on impulse power.
Orbit where?
Earth, Captain.
We were on a course
in this direction
when we were pulled
in by the star.
The breakaway threw us
on in the same direction.
Screen on.
We're too low in the atmosphere
to retain this orbit.
Engineering reports we have
sufficient impulse power
to achieve
escape velocity.
Give us some
altitude, Sulu.
Yes, sir.
Helm answering.
She's sluggish, sir.
Captain,
normal Starfleet channel
has nothing but static.
I'm getting something
on another frequency,
but it's not Starfleet.
Put it on audio.
This is
the 5.:30 news summary.
Cape Kennedy--the first
manned Moon shot
is scheduledfor Wednesday,
All three astronauts who are
making this historic--
Manned Moon shot?
That was in
the late 1960s.
Apparently, Captain,
so are we.
What?
Whiplash propelled us into
a time warp, Captain--backward.
Exact chronometer readings
in a few moments.
Captain, I'm getting
ground-to-air transmission.
Verified.
Scanners report some type
of craft approaching from below,
under cloud cover
and closing.
Bluejay 4, this is Blackjack.
We're tracking you
and the U.F. O.
I have him on
my screen. Following.
Mr. Sulu, can you gain
altitude faster?
I want to
outdistance him.
Picking up, sir.
She's still slow in responding.
Blackjack,
this is Bluejay 4.
U.F.O. is picking up speed
and climbing.
I'm going in closer.
Bluejay 4, you should be
close enough for visual contact.
I can see it now.
Whatever this is,
it's big.
Two cylindrical
projections on top,
one below.
Purpose--undetermined.
We have two flights
scrambled andon the way.
They should rendezvous
in your sector in two minutes.
It won't be here.
The U.F.O.'s climbing away.
Bluejay 4,
you're ordered to close
and attempt to force
the U.F. O. to land.
We want it brought down
or disabled until
the other planes arrive.
Acknowledged.
Closing on target.
Positive identification,
Captain.
Aircraft is an interceptor,
equipped with missiles, possibly
armed with nuclear warheads.
If he hits us with one,
he might damage us severely,
perhaps beyond our capacity
to repair under current circumstances.
Scotty,
Activate tractor beam.
Lock onto that aircraft
and hold it out there.
Captain, this
type of aircraft
might be too fragile
for our tractor beam.
Tractor beam on.
We have the target.
Aircraft is
breaking up, Captain.
Transporter room.
Can you lock onto the
cockpit of that aircraft?
Scanning area, sir.
Try and beam
that pilot aboard.
Take over, Mr. Spock.
Welcome aboard
the Enterprise.
You speak English.
That's right.
You can step off
the transporter, uh--
Captain John Christopher,
United States Air Force.
Serial number 4857932.
Relax, Captain,
you're among friends.
I'm Captain
James T. Kirk.
What's going on here?
Where am I?
What happened?
You people--
who are you?
All in good time,
Captain.
Meanwhile...
Let me apologize for bringing you
aboard this ship so abruptly.
It couldn't be helped.
I didn't know your craft
couldn't take
our tractor beam--
Just tell me
who you are.
We'll tell you what
we decide to tell you shortly.
For now, relax.
You're our guest.
You'll find it interesting.
Bridge to Captain Kirk.
What is it, Mr. Spock?
The aircraft has
completely broken up.
Shall we turn off
the tractor beam?
Affirmative. We
have the pilot aboard.
I'll be right up.
Kirk out.
Follow me.
Good morning,
Captain.
Good morning.
Captain.
A woman?
Crewman.
Bridge.
Must have
taken quite a lot
to build a ship
like this.
There are only 12 like it
in the fleet.
I see.
Did the Navy--
We're a combined
service, Captain.
Our authority is
the United Earth Space Probe Agency.
United Earth?
This is very
difficult to explain.
We're from your future.
A time warp
placed us here.
It was an accident.
You seem to
have a lot of them.
However...
I can't deny the fact
that you're here,
with this ship.
I never have believed
in little green men.
Neither have I.
Captain Christopher,
this is my
First Officer
Lieutenant Commander Spock.
Captain.
Feel free to
look around, Captain.
Don't touch anything.
You'll find it interesting.
Interesting is a word and a half
for it, Captain.
We've achieved a stable orbit
out of Earth's atmosphere.
Our deflectors
are operative,
enough to prevent our
being picked up again as a U.F.O.
Mr. Scott wishes to speak to you
about the engines.
Very well, Mr. Spock--
Anything else
on your mind?
Captain Christopher.
What about him?
We cannot return him
to Earth, Captain.
He already knows too much about us
and is learning more.
I do not specifically refer
to Captain Christopher,
but suppose
an unscrupulous man
were to gain
certain knowledge
of man's future?
Such a man could manipulate
key industries,
stocks,
and even nations.
And, in so doing,
change what must be.
And if it
is changed, Captain,
you and I, and
all that we know,
might not even exist.
Your logic
can be most...
annoying.
That flight suit
must be uncomfortable.
Why don't you have
the quartermaster
issue him something
more suitable?
Then I want to meet you
and him in my quarters.
Yes, sir.
Computer on. Record.
Recording.
Come.
Captain's log--
supplemental.
Engineering Officer Scott
informs warp engines damaged,
but can be made operational
and re-energized.
Computed and recorded, dear.
Computer, you will not address me
in that manner. Compute.
Computed, dear.
Mr. Spock,
I ordered this computer
and its interlinking systems repaired.
I have investigated
it, Captain.
To correct the fault
will require
an overhaul of the entire
computer system
and a minimum of three weeks
at a starbase.
I wouldn't mind so much
if it didn't get so...
affectionate.
It also has an unfortunate
tendency to giggle.
I take it a lady computer
is not routine.
We'd put in at Signet 14
for general repairs.
Signet 14 is a planet
dominated by women.
They felt the ship's computer system
lacked a personality.
They gave it one.
Female, of course.
Ha ha!
Well, you people
certainly have
interesting problems.
I'd love to
stay around to see
how your girlfriend
works out, but--
I'm afraid you'll have to.
We can't send you back.
Can't?
Spock said that your transporter
can beam down an object,
even from
an orbit this high.
It's not the transporter.
It's you.
You know what
the future looks like.
If anybody
else finds out,
they could change
its course, destroy it.
Then my disappearance
would change something, too.
I have run a check
on all historical tapes.
They show no record of any relevant
contribution by John Christopher.
Look, Captain, I don't buy all your
time-accident story.
The experts can figure out
who you are, what you are.
It's my duty to
report what I've seen.
What would you do?
I'd...report,
If I could.
We can't
take the risk.
I don't want to
know about risks.
I have a wife,
two children.
What about them?
I'm sorry.
Engine room to Captain Kirk.
Kirk here.
What is it, Scotty?
Progress report, sir.
Everything's jerry-rigged, but we're
coming along with the repairs.
We could re-energize in
about four hours, but, uh...
But what, Scotty?
Well, sir, as I say,
the, uh, the engines
are being repaired,
but we've no place
to go in this time.
If you--
If--If you
see what I mean?
Sir?
Yes, Scotty, carry on.
Too bad, Captain.
Maybe I can't go home,
but neither can you.
You're as much a prisoner
in time as I am.
Captain 's Log
Stardate 3113.7.
Our engines
are being repaired,
but we are still
locked in time.
And we have aboard a passenger
whom we do not want,
and we cannot return.
Recommendation for his
disposition, dear.
Maintenance note--
My recording computer
has a serious malfunction.
Recommend it either
be corrected...
or scrapped. Compute.
Computed.
Bridge
to Captain Kirk.
Kirk, here.
Have some new information
regarding Captain Christopher.
Important I see you
both immediately.
Yes, Mr. Spock.
Report to my quarters.
I'll contact
Captain Christopher.
Yes, sir. Bridge out.
Captain Christopher...
Captain Christopher?
Security, this
is the captain.
Security Chief
here, sir.
All decks alert.
Captain Christopher is not
in his assigned quarters.
He may be trying
to escape.
Put a man outside
the transporter room immediately.
I'm heading there myself.
All right!
Nice and easy.
Now I'm going to step
into that thing,
and you're going to transport me
back to Earth.
Well, Jim, with the exception of
a slight bruise or two,
our captain is as healthy as
a proverbial horse.
He'll be coming to
in a minute.
He tried to escape.
I know how he feels,
but I can't send him back
with what he knows.
Jim, what if
we can't go back?
What do we do?
Wait up here for our
supplies to run out,
our power to die?
It has to eventually,
and we certainly
can't go back to Earth.
It would be worse
than the Captain being returned.
There are 430 of us.
Now, that means 430 chances of
altering the future.
Yes...
We're not
in that position yet.
I'm glad to hear it.
And if we do get back
to where we belong,
then he won't belong.
We're roughly about
the same age.
But in our society,
he'd be useless.
Archaic.
Maybe he could be
retrained, re-educated.
Now you're sounding
like Spock.
If you're going to get nasty,
I'm going to leave.
Could he be retrained
to forget his family?
His children?
The answer
to that is no.
Mmm.
You all right?
Yeah.
I see physical
training
is required in
your service, too.
Mmm. Crude methods,
but effective.
What does he
mean by that?
Just a joke, Captain.
You said you had some additional
information, Mr. Spock?
I made an error
in my computations.
Oh? This could be
an historic occasion.
I find that we must return
Captain Christopher to Earth after all.
Why? You said
I made no relative contribution.
Poor choice of words
on my part.
I neglected, in my
initial run-through,
to correlate the possible
contributions by offspring.
I find, after running
a cross-check on that factor,
that your son
Colonel Sean Jeffrey Christopher
headed, or will head, the first
successful Earth-Saturn probe,
which is
a rather significant--
Wait a minute.
I don't have a son.
You mean, yet.
The doctor is correct.
Unless we return
Captain Christopher to Earth,
There will be no Colonel
Sean Jeffrey Christopher
to go to Saturn.
Well, that's it,
isn't it?
We'll have to find
some way of...
A boy.
I'm going
to have a son.
Acknowledging that
we must return Captain Christopher,
there are
several problems,
prime of which is
the explanation of his return.
We tracked his
plane wreckage down
after our tractor beam
crushed it.
It crashed in an open section
of southern Nebraska.
That means those
search parties
will be crawling
all over that range.
Captain Christopher
himself complicated the matter.
When I made
visual contact,
I turned on
my wing cameras.
I got close enough to take
some pretty clear pictures.
Air Defense Command
will be processing
that film fast.
And A.D.C. Control was
probably recording
my radio transmissions.
If I remember my history,
these things
were being dismissed
as weather balloons,
sundogs, explainable things--
at least publicly.
Captain, our tractor beam caught
and crushed an Air Force plane.
It'll be impossible
to explain this
as anything other
than a genuine U.F.O.
Possibly alien...
definitely destructive.
What about our
problem, Mr. Spock?
Any ideas on how to get us back
to our own time?
A theory...
a reverse application
of what happened to us.
Logically, it could work.
Also, logically, there are
a hundred variables,
any one of which could put
us in a worse position
than we're in now.
We're going to have
to go back
and get those reports
and photos.
If the captain feels duty bound
to report what he saw,
there won't be any
evidence to support him.
That makes me look
like a liar or a fool.
Perhaps.
Not at all.
You'll simply be one
of the thousands
who thought he saw a U.F.O.
Captain,
I know that base.
I was stationed there a year ago.
I'd like to--
No, Captain. Thank you.
But if anything
should go wrong,
you might get hurt.
We couldn't risk that.
Neither could you...
or your son.
Well, I'd like
to help.
I could sketch a layout of
the place for you,
show you where
the record section
and the photo lab are.
Primitive computer.
I've seen them
demonstrated in museums.
Me, too.
If this one's
like those,
it'll make the devil's noise
if you start it.
I don't intend
to start it.
How long have they
been down there now?
Well, shouldn't
they be coming up?
It is a fact, Doctor,
that prowling by stealth
is more time-consuming
than a direct approach.
In our case--
Shouldn't you
be working on
your time warp
calculations, Mr. Spock?
I am.
Hold it.
Get your hands up.
Now...one
at a time--
Hand me those belts.
And the bag.
It's been too long.
Jim should have
at least signaled by now.
You may be correct, Doctor.
Open communicator channel.
What was that?
What was what?
That noise.
I didn't hear
anything.
That noise-- It's coming from
one of these things.
The emergency signal.
Stay right where you are.
One emergency signal, sir.
Beam up immediately.
Only one signal.
What happened?
We'll know
in a moment, Doctor.
Kirk to Enterprise.
Spock here.
Are you all right, Captain?
Yes, I'm all right,
but as you can see,
we have...another problem.
Captain 's Log,
Stardate 3113.9.
First Officer Spock
recording.
Due to an unfortunate
accident,
we have taken aboard
another unwanted passenger.
Your surprise package
is an air police sergeant
from the base.
Keep him there.
No use in letting him
see more of the ship
than is necessary.
I don't believe there'll be trouble
in that respect, Captain.
Our guest seems
quite satisfied
to remain
where he is.
Kirk out.
What was
the chronometer reading
when we first sighted
Christopher's jet?
in that time zone--
maybe a little after.
Put it at the end
of these tapes, will you?
You've got them all.
We'll try the darkroom.
Photo lab.
That's...
That's it.
That's all ofthem.
Signal Mr. Spock that we're
almost ready to beam up.
I'll make a check
of the files just in case.
Yes, sir.
All right.
Where's the other one?
What other one?
Your partner.
I saw somebody move in there.
No, no, no.Just me.
Besides, could anyone get out of here
without your seeing them?
No. Nobody should have
been able to.
Your decision to beam up was
quite correct, Mr. Sulu.
Engine room
to Mr. Spock.
Spock here.
We've completedre-energizing
the warp engines, sir.
We can refire them
anytime.
Do so now, engineer.
We'll need all power
to test our theory.
Aye, sir.
Engine room out.
Hmm.
Poor photography.
Blast your theories
and observations, Mr. Spock.
What about Jim? He's down there alone,
probably under arrest.
He doesn't have
a communicator,
and we can't locate him
or beam him back aboard without one.
I am aware of that, Doctor.
This is the first officer.
Captain Christopher
to the briefing room.
Now, look, Mister. You and I
had better start communicating.
I want to know
how you got in here.
That's a simple
question.
Nobody saw you.
You got all the way inside
without tripping any alarm.
How did you do it?
Believe me, Colonel,
you wouldn't
believe me.
Don't try to be funny.
How did you get in?
I popped in
out of thin air.
You seem to think
this is some kind of a game.
No, Colonel.
I know it's no game.
What did you say
your name was?
For the fourth time,
my name is
James T. Kirk.
And how did you
get inside
a top security installation,
James T. Kirk?
I told you you wouldn't
believe me.
Uh...Colonel,
would you mind
being careful with that?
That worries you, huh?
Is that a radio, transmitter
of some kind?
Of some kind.
You can be more specific
than that, Kirk.
I don't like
mysteries.
If you don't stop
being careless with that,
you'll have one--
a big one.
I'll have it
disassembled and examined.
We are not dummies, mister.
We know how to fi nd out things
we want to know.
What is that?
Is that a uniform
of some kind?
This little thing?
Something
I slipped on.
Kirk, maybe you don't realize
how serious this is.
Sabotage of a government
installation--
Did I sabotage
something?
No. We stopped you
in time.
But what would you have done
if we hadn't found you?
Believe me, Colonel,
nothing at all.
Is that what you're here for,
nothing at all?
That's what would
have happened
if you hadn't
interfered.
All right, Kirk.
maybe this will make you laugh--
Sabotage, espionage,
unauthorized entry, burglary!
How are those
for starters?
I can think up
lots more
if you don't
start talking.
All right, Colonel.
The truth is, I'm a little green man
from Alpha Centauri,
a beautiful place.
You ought to see it.
I am going to
lock you up for 200 years.
That ought to be
Just about right.
He's probably being held
in security section.
Even if they've notified
the authorities,
it'll take time
for someone to get there.
Can you give us
the coordinates
to beam down a landing party near
those interrogation rooms?
Yes. But you're not
going to get them
unless you take me
with you.
I can't do that,
Captain.
If something
went wrong--
Something's
already gone wrong.
You could beam down
anywhere inside that base,
but it would take
time to find him.
Mr. Sulu,
you and Captain Christopher
will beam down
with me.
The captain will provide
the coordinates
for the transporter chief.
Shall I issue phasers?
One for you,
one for me,
set on heavy
stun force.
Yes, sir.
You don't trust me, Spock.
In fact, I do...
but only
to a certain point.
Energize.
Do they do that
all the time?
Are you hungry?
Uh-huh.
What would you like?
Maybe some
chicken soup.
It is.
Just a minute, sir.
Hold it.
See what that is, airman.
Don't you find that
painful, Captain?
Yes, I do.
What's he doing here?
He knew the exact
beam down coordinates.
It was necessary
to bring him along.
I see.
No harm done.
Mr. Sulu, did you check out
those tapes?
Mr. Spock ran them through.
We got them all.
They know
you've been here.
They have a mystery
and no answers.
Mr. Sulu, signal
the transporter chief.
Four to beam up.
Uh-uh. Not me.
Don't be a fool.
You know
what's at stake.
You bet I do--
My family.
A son that isn't born yet.
You don't have to
return me now, Captain.
Spock,
come out of there.
You can't explain
your presence here.
It's my duty
to report everything.
That's explanation
enough.
Spock!
You'll go home,
Christopher...
but you'll do it
our way.
Over my dead body.
I suspected he might not wish
to return with us.
Four to beam up,
Mr. Sulu.
Yes, sir.
Captain 's Log,
Stardate 3114.1.
We must make an attempt
to break free of this time,
or we and our
reluctant passengers
will remain its prisoners.
All we have is a theory
anda few facts.
Mr. Scott and I
both agree
that the only
possible solution
is the slingshot
effect,
Like the one
that put us here.
My computations indicate
that if we fly
toward the sun,
seek out its
magnetic attraction,
then pull away
at full power,
the whiplash will propel us into
another time warp.
Slingshot effects
are fine for you people.
How do you propose
to return the Sergeant and me?
Logically, as we move faster
and faster toward the sun,
we'll begin to move
backward in time.
We'll actually go back
beyond yesterday,
beyond the point when we first
appeared in the sky.
Then, breaking free
will shoot us forward in time,
and we'll transport you back
before any of this happened.
You won't remember
anything,
because it never
would have happened.
What if you can't pull free
of the sun?
We'll not be
getting so close
that my engines
couldn't pull us out.
What I am worried
about, sir--
We may not have
much control
when we're thrown
forward again.
Helm control?
Braking control, sir.
If I can't stop us soon enough,
we may overshoot
our time,
and if I stop
the engines suddenly,
the strain may
tear us apart.
Any way we do it,
it's a mighty rough ride.
Well, gentlemen,
we all have to take a chance--
especially
if one is all you have.
Assume your stations.
Affirmative.
Engineering to bridge.
Environmentalcontrol,
negative.
Engineering control,
negative.
Ahead warp factor 3,
Mr. Sulu.
Warp factor 3, sir.
I never thought
I'd make it into space.
I was in line to be chosen
for the space program...
but I didn't qualify.
Take a good look
around, Captain.
You made it here
ahead of all of them.
Sir, our speed
is increasing.
We're traveling
at warp 8.
Mr. Spock.
Since we've passed Mercury,
the sun's pull on us
has increased greatly.
From here,
we'll move even faster.
And, Captain,
notice the chronometers.
They've started
backward.
Minute by minute,
the speed o ftime passage
will now increase.
Get your gear.
Report to the transporter room.
And Captain
Christopher,
you only have about 15 years,
so you'd better hurry.
Approaching
breakaway point.
On the countdown.
Now, Mr. Sulu.
More power, Mr. Sulu.
Maximum now, sir.
She's fighting it.
Engineering, can you give
a damage report?
Point 5here.
Confirm.
Gravity is down
to point 8.
We've broken free
and heading back.
Gaining speed now,
Captain.
We're now at warp 4.
Warp 7.
Off the dial, sir.
Chronometer is moving forward
again, Captain.
You have
the chronometer reading
and the coordinates to return
Captain Christopher and the guard?
Computed.
Bridge to transporter room.
Captain Christopher.
This is Christopher.
We're coming up
on Earth fast, Captain.
Everything A-okay.
Uh, Captain...
thanks for
the look ahead.
Our pleasure, Captain.
Bridge out.
It'll be close.
Bridge to transporter room.
Prepare to energize.
Energize.
You should be
close enough
for a visual contact.
Bluejay 4.
Can you see it?
What is it?
Bluejay 4. Come in.
We've lost the image.
Blackjack,
this is Bluejay 4.
I could have sworn there was
some kind of ship, but...
nothing could have
moved that fast.
We don't track mirages.
Mark it down
as another U.F. O.
Bluejay 4
returning to base.
Out.
Approaching
second beaming, Captain.
Bridge to transporter room,
prepare to energize.
Now.
Energize.
Past Pluto, sir.
What's our reading,
Mr. Spock?
Approaching
our century, Captain.
Braking should begin...
now.
Bridge to engineering.
Begin full braking power.
Pulling away from the sun
weakened them, sir.
