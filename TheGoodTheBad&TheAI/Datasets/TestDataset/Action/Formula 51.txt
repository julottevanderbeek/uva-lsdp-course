He's a genius, hmm?
Who is this cunt?
So l said to Mr Durant, l said, ''Mr Durant,
we go and meet this fuckin' Yank McElroy,

None of this fuckin'

None of this asking him

No, l said, ''Fuck him.
l bring him to the deal,
l get my fuckin' tickets and l'm off. That's it.''
- Take a eft up here
- There's no time for this .
Take a fuckin' left!
Felix! Felix, listen!
This is a totally new chemical.
Once we have the formula,
we could make this stuff in a kitchen.
We don't even need Durant.
Look. You see that?
That's tomorrow. Blokes are shagging

Oh...
Well, that's young Felix's weapon of choice,

Now, there's a trip down memory lane.
l'm partial to a bit of sentiment, me.
l've heard things, you know. He misses you.
So, what are you going to take?
l'll take the Baretta, the CZ, an ankle holster,
add the mini-1 4 and l'm done.
- l want to get in and out fast.
- Don't we all?
Does Durant still do his deals at the Port Hotel?
Silly lad. lt'll be his undoing, one of these days .
But what do you expect from a fella
who gets his arse waxed every month?
l forgot what a circus this place is .
Funny, that.

Felix DeSouza.
- l count ten.
- That's right.
That's one million sterling,
or 1 ...1 .6 million dollars .
But that ain't what we agreed on, is it?
You're 1 8.4 million dollars shy.
And l don't care how you cut it,
that's a whole lot shy.
No...
Mr McElroy, what we have there
is a goodwill gesture.
A deposit. A down payment.
One and a half million's not a bad start, is it?
l need to do some research. l need to feed
a few thousand to the kids, get some feedback.
You don't think l can allow you
to walk out of here with $20 million
for a formula that only exists in your head?
And all l get is what?
An ointment for toe jam.
Uh-huh?
- Market research.
- Right.
Profile customers, send out questionnaires .
Get out the bloody way, Felix.
l can dig that. But unless you've got what
we agreed on, what the fuck am l doing here?
Give me a call when you're ready to deal.

And l've hurt my knee.

You got that? And then you call me.
Now, what else have you got?
Six dead bodies and one live one.

- Chief, it's Leopold Durant.
Durant? Right. Now, concentrate, Arthur.
Get that fat fuck down here pronto.
But, sir, he's dying.
Then you'd better be fucking quick about it,
hadn't you?
She dumped me.
Two years ago now.
Changed her name from Dawn to Dakota.
Fucked off for Las Vegas and a deck of cards .
So who hired her to take me out?
You're asking the wrong question, mate.
She's your guardian angel.
fshe warhtedyou dead you'd be dead
She never misses .
l mean, fucking look at that.
lf she really wanted to hit me...l'd be shiteing
through a tube for the rest of my life.
Someone wants you kept alive.
Somebody's trying to cut in on Durant's deal.
They're shitting again.
- Yeah, well, shit happens .
- No
Shit don't just happen, shit takes time.
Shit takes effort.
$20 million-worth of effort.
l've got to get a new deal on, fast.
You know the town, you know the players .
Look...
..all l want is a ticket for the game.
Do you think you can swing that?
$20 million could swing anything.
You know what l'm selling.
Well, how much?
That's a million dollars .
Hell, you could buy your own
goddamn stadium with that.
- Game's tomorrow.
- You'd better get started, then.
Oh, and Felix.
A word of advice.
You ever want to get the girl,
you've got to broaden your horizons .
KANE: What the fuck is that?
What is it?
What? Scotch mist?
Now, now, now, now, now.
You are getting greedy, Leopold.
lt's a big deal going down, and you are trying to
cut me out of the fucking loop.
-
- l told you. Face the fuck front!
This is going to cost you
an additional 1 5%.
No?
All right, then. 30.
As you're being so difficult.
How about this?
Leopold, l don't know if you noticed, my son,
but you're in urgent need of a fucking doctor.
Good boy.
All right, then, Arthur. Take him down.
Argh!
Fuck!
You really have excelled yourself this time,
haven't you, Arthur? Brilliant. Fucking brilliant.

# Don't be cruel
# To a heart that's true...
l wanted to see the world.
Liverpool isn't the world.
l couldn't take America.
lt was like fucking Albania in neon.
And that stupid football shirt.
What kind of man jumps into bed shouting,
''Come on, you Reds''?
She made me laugh.
Good shag, though.
l tell you, she'd kill anyone for me,
l'll say that for her.
He's got problems .
She's got problems .
Shouldn't have come back.
Better off.
l need everything on this list.
l'm dying for a smoke.
You haven't any ciggies, have you?
l'm sorry. Cigarettes are bad for your health.
So's a fucking punch in the throat.
l need fucking nicotine now!
No need to shout at me.
l'm Pakistani, not deaf.
- Take a puff on this !
- Oh, fuck off.
You?
You! Dress-wearing er...monkey-boy.
SKlNHEADS: Monkey-boy!
You're going to take them drugs of yours
and make it work for us .
- And where would l do this?
- ln my lab.
- You got a lab?
- Yeah, of course.
What do you take us for?
Rank fucking amateurs?
# Thrash metal
Come on!
Just say no.
FELlX: How the fuck dd we erhd up rh here?
One little mistake...30 years ago.
All of these items are over-the-counter.
Nothing illegal here.
You're no fucking help, are you?
l beg to differ. You see, it's not the ingredients
themselves which determine the effect
but the manner in which they're combined.
These kids are getting very smart.
He's right.
The ravers are the key.
Aren't you the clever little chunky monkey?
You keep banging on about my weight.
You're crossing a line.
Arthur, it was a joke.
lt was a joke. Smile.
Smile.
You fat cunt.
Yo, Blowjob.
P-O-S 51 . Comes in blue or race-car red.
Destination: stratosphere.
Only, this one gets you there in 60 seconds .
You try one first.
Thought you'd never ask.
P-O-S 51 ?
You can't call it that.
Punters'll feel like right tits
asking for tabs of 438 l-O-U,
whatever the number is .
No-one's going to know what they're on about.
These scumbags spend their entire life
smacked out of their heads .
Numbers - they couldn't even tell you
what fucking time it is .
All right, Mr Smug, what have you done?
l think the shit's about to hit the fan.
Arrrrrgh!
Phew. Eurgh.
-
- Curry was a bad idea, lads .
- Oh yeah
ALL: Please. Please.
BLOWFlSH: Oh, thanks. Oh, thanks .

Every chemical used in the production
of this drug is 1 00% legal.
Not one ingredient is found on any known
government's banned substance watch list.
Hell, you can ship supertankers of this shit.
You can even lay a goddamn pipeline
and no-one would bat an eye.
P-O-S 51 .
lt's all that.
And it can be yours .
lf the price...is right.
Chemistry...Mr McElroy.
What is chemistry...
..but the ability to attract adoration in others?
You see, you're like me, Mr McElroy.
You're a sky-highatrist, l'm a sky-highatrist.
See  aways krhew 'd be a drug deaer
everh wherh  was a kd
saw my dad ht my mother
my mother ht my brother
my brother hit my sister,
and my sister fuck my father.
So it's inevitable, really.
You'd have to be on drugs
just to live in that madhouse, wouldn't you?
Drugs are good, Mr McElroy.
Drugs are our mates .
Fuck. l'm getting on my own nerves .
What l'm trying to say to you, Mr McElroy, is...
..l'm very much attracted
to what you have to offer.
How are you doing, Felix?
Well, my boss is dead...
..can't get a ticket for tomorrow's match,
and, oh, yeah,
l've got a fucking bullet hole in the arse.
Apart from that,
l'm tiptop.
So who's the target?
You've got that look in your eye.
l've been looking for you
Oh, yeah? For old times' sake
or for the company l keep?
Little bit of both.
So, you have got me on your list, then?
You've always been on my list.

- 40 years ago
a rock-and-roll revolution
was launched in this town.
Tonight, we're going to launch a rhew revolution.
One that will rock and roll your senses .
And you...are my test pilots .
You're going to kiss the sun
and taste the motherfuckin' rainbow.
- Are you ready?
-
- Are...you...ready?

Then let's get ready to party-y-y-y.
# THRlLLSEEKERS: Synaesthesia
Have you any idea how much l missed you?
Why didn't you stay with me, then?
What, me? ln America? Don't be soft!
Besides, l don't know who you are any more, girl.
lt's been nearly two years .
l haven't heard a word.
Still...
l always hoped...
..you might...
change your mind...
..and come home.
We could have a fresh start.
Aren't you going to say anything?
This, Mr McElroy, is a fucking miracle.
Drug use will reach epidemic proportions ,
revolutions will break out, governments will fall!
- Where do l sign?
- Si... Sign?!
This ain't some written contract.
The kind of agreement l could take you to court
and sue your ass over.
You fuck me on this deal,
l gotta take out a contract just to get even
on the goddamn contract!
We think we have an agreement,
we think we see things the same way.
Either we do, or we don't.
You're either in, or you're out.
You give me the money, l give you the formula.
Are we clear?
Crystal, Mr McElroy. Crystal.
l'm not Leo Durant. l'm a man of my word.
Get in my way,
and l'm gonna have to shoot you.
Get in my way,
and l'm gonna have to shoot you again.
l've got to work, babe.
Fucking cow!
Oh, fuck!
Can't a brother just deal some goddamn drugs?
Time to go, Elmo.
Mr Kane. ls it that time of the month already?
l thought you weren't due till next week,
you eager beaver.
Now, ain't that always the way?
Elevator music, a nigger in a kilt,
and a chick with a nickel-plated nine.
And now a word from our sponsor.
That ain't no Liverpool accent.
- Say hello, Elmo.
- Hello, Elmo.
Abserhce makes the heart grow forhder Emo
Arhd The Lzard s so fu of
motherfucking fonderence for you
that he got on this plane just to come see you.
l'm touched.
- You w be.
- You got my cash?
You're flush, sweetcakes. You are flush.
He's looking forward to seeing you.
So, what's the price tag on my ass?
lt's enough. Move.
Last stop. There's nowhere from here but down.
Reel me in!
Why would l do a stupid thing like that?
- Pull me up, will you?
- Fold or call?
- What?
- You play poker. Fold or call?
-
- l'm your last chance, girl.
l'm that out you've been looking for.
l'm only gonna make this offer once.
You either take it
and get out from under The Lizard,
or you stay a slave
and wonder where your life went.
You think you can save me, do you?
Look where you are!
- Get real!
- A million in bonds, untraceable.
That's real! That's a fresh start.
Try quitting while you're ahead
for a change...Dawn.
- No.
- No?!
l want 1 0% of your deal with lki.
You're negotiating with me?!
Look at your options .
Have a look at yours .
All right.
Now that is a lovely dress .
Need the extra room, do you?
Tell me something. l'm intrigued.
ls it true that you fellas are equipped
with incredibly...
..large...
Fuck!
Thanks .
My pleasure.
You can move your arm now.

And l, Virgil Kane...
Well, l want to know why.
Nobody cuts me out of anything
in this parochial pisshole.
You smell that, Felix. Smell it.
- Smell it!
-
That is essence of Durant.
And Durant got what he deserved.
So, when a deal goes down,
you, my old sausage, will fix it. Time and place.
And then you will call me.
Otherwise... Accessory to murder.
Possession of a firearm.
You fuck me,
l'll have you on your hands and your knees ,
with your arse in the air, exposing your rusty
sheriff's badge for the next 20 years .
So ask yourself, are you going to help restore
some national pride,
and stick one on the Yanks?
Or, like the rest of your life,
are you going to piss it all away?
Are you going to help me
to help you?
Eight hours till kickoff.
lt's a big game.
Let's just see if you come good.
Mr Kane.
See ya!
- You'll never walk alone, eh, mate?

Help me to help you? Cunt!

DAWN: Busht
Kevin Brown couldn't carry
Sandy Koufax's jockstrap.
You've been listening to too much Vince Scully.
You need to get your ear out of the radio,
and carry your ass out to the ball game.
Sorry, but er...
..have l missed something?
What the fuck is that?
- Black pudding. Fried pig's blood.
- Oh!
Are you two planning on filling me in, or what?
Elmo's propositioned her.
Nice one, Shirley.
l'm listening.
Lizard offered Dakota 250K
to deliver my live ass to him.
l've made her a significantly better offer.
And l'm thinking...she might entertain...
..certain sentimental reasons
for not doing her job.
The questorh s
whether it's going to pay me...to be sentimental.
Look, we have a choice.
We can use our ''Get out of jail free'' cards ,
or we can choose ''Stop, do not pass Go''.
Do not collect 20 million dollars .
Do we have a deal?
Do that again, l will definitely fucking shoot you.
Shut your gob! Go and get yourself cleaned up!
- And no shagging up there!
- Yeah.
No shagging up there.
We do this job and we get out.
lt's what we all want, isn't it?
# l don't know why
# l love you like l do, but l do
Just to get out.
# l don't know why
# You treat me like you do
# But you do
# Lord, you do
So, what's the plan?
You tell me.
# Lord, you do me any way you please
What's the plan?
You tell me.
# No matter how you treat me, woman
# Lord, l just can't seem to leave
# l don't know
# What you're using on me, baby, but it's good
# Ooh, it's real good
# l know l would surely leave you, woman
# Oh, if l could
# l surely would
# Ooh
Listen! lt's got to come from your belly.
Right deep down!
lt's your birth trauma.
Now cleanse your chakras and let it all out.
- Let it go!
- l'm trying, you fucking fairy!
A-a-a-a-ah!
All right? A-a-a-ah!
A-a-a-a-a-ah!
- All-righty. Good morning.
- All right, let's finish this deal.
My sentiments exactly.
- Any particular venue?
- No arports rho hote rooms
no dockyards, no barges, no pharmacies ,
- no animal-testing labs .
- Oh!
- No rooftops .
- Riddles! Riddles! l love riddles .
No abandoned warehouses or rave clubs .
l want total privacy
in a very public place.
And security.
Cops. Lots of them.
And witnesses. Thousands of witnesses .
- You getting my drift?
- We er 've got a certarh er
business indulgence, shall we say,
that l could er...utilise.
- So, what time's kickoff?
- Three o'cock sharp
l'll be there.
Football and drugs .
A perfect Saturday afternoon.
Liverpool!
Liverpool!
Come on!
Chakras !
No, no, no, no, no, chubster.
- You stay here.
- What for?
l don't know. Keep your eyes peeled on the exit.
And try for fuck's sake to blend in, cunt!
This clown better deliver.
Don't worry. lki put something like this together
a couple of years ago now.
Yeah? What happened?
They all died.
We get in, we get out.
What about the game?
- We're staying to watch the game, right?
- Dude, l'm in, then l'm out.
TANNOY: Vrgrh Atarhtc arhrhourhce

Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Welcome to Anfield, the home of football.
- Too right, pal.
- McElroy, DeSouza.
Yes, sir. Take the lift to the third floor.
lt's the first door on your right, sir.
Thank you.
- Sir?
- Don't you want to search me?
Guests for the executive suites
are never searched, sir.
Right. l knew that.
Welcome! Come in, come in.
Excellent.
l'm nothing if not hospitable, Felix.
Make yourself at home.
lKl: 'm so excted  coud sht

we pretend we're friends ,
- and we go our separate ways .
- Forepay Mr McEroy
- lt's the only way to a good relationship.
- Ah
lki, my love, we're way past holding hands .
What?! ls that supposed to be 20 mill?
l'm not heftin' gold bars around the shop, am l?
lt's not fucking Goldfinger, is it?
Ah-ah-ah-ah!
Easy, flower.
Where's my formula?
Wish you were here?
l'm fucking there, Mr McElroy. l'm fucking there.
An inspired choice, l must say,
my er...chemical brother.
Cheers .
Ah-ah-ah-ah!
l never was one to be too sentimental.
Elmo!
t arh't ofterh
that a blowed-up motherfucker gets to chat
to the motherfucker that blowed him up.
You got that right.
Usually, the blowed-up motherfucker
has the courtesy to stay blowed up.
l'll try to be more accommodating next time,
Elmo.
Ooh, cocktails! What are we celebrating?
Oh, er...we're toasting...
..our deal, Mr Lizard.
- Our deal?
- Not your deal.
Harhds across the ocearh you mght say
Fucking twat.
Elmo Mix-Master.
Cheers .
- l love your touches .
- To a global partnership.
LlZARD: To a gobapartrhershp
Ow.
Fucking limey bastard.
Global partnership, my ass !
My money is on good old-fashioned
American monopoly, you son of a bitch!
Besides ,
England ain't nothin'...
rhothrh' but the 51 st state!
Don't you just fucking hate it
when a motherfucker stabs you in the back?
The Lizard travelled 1 2,000 miles
to settle accounts with you!
So? What?
You gonna tell me how much you missed me,
or are you gonna shoot me?
l'm sick and tired of fucking chasing your ass !
Now, you give me my fucking goods ,
and you give 'em to me fucking now!
You better chill with that shit, motherfucker.
-  owrh you
- You owrh me?
- l fucking own you!
- You own shit!
Go ahead, kill me. Put me out of my misery
for the first time in 30 years .
But you will no longer take what is mine.
Fucking right. 1 0% is mine.
- Five!
- Five fucking per cent of that's mine.
Shut the fuck up!
l don't even know who the fuck you are!
Oh, you've got some big fucking onions, Elmo.
This...
is the most expensive candy on the market.
The drug's a fake, you know.
lt's bogus. lt's what we chemists call a placebo.
lt's whatever you want it to be.
You can run all the tests you want,
and it'll look like the best shit in the universe,
but the ingredients...they cancel each other out.
Fucking confusing The Lizard
ain't gonna fucking help your cause, Elmo.
You've gotta give big ups to marketing.
The ability to make people believe.
The power of suggestion.
P-O-S
l don't give a shit!
ls this fucking science lecture over?
lt will be in...23 seconds .
t takes 10 secorhds for arh mbbed qud
to reach the stomach
lt takes the human body 81 seconds to heat
that liquid to the point of chemical volatility.
You...have 1 2 seconds left.
What the fuck are you talking about?
And what is the big fucking umbrella?
Freeze!
- Oh!
- You umpy
in the kaftan, drop the gun.
Nice and controlled. How's my timing, Felix?
lt's fucking perfect.
Ow! Argh!
Aaaargh!
Aargh!
That cleared my sinuses .
Drugs...
always kill you in the end.
Whoa! Whoa. Whoa, shit!
All right, lads .
Get the cuffs on this cockney twat!
As agreed.
What about the drug?
You conned us .
l conned them
We got paid.
ls this ,
or is this not, worth 20 million dollars?
This castle's worth,
l'd say, more like...
seven, seven and a half.
Do you want to see the game?
# Easy come
# Easy go
# Watch the world flow
Mr McElroy,
you are a genuine McElroy like myself,
you say.
This is the tartan of my slave master.
l now claim his castle and his lands for my own.
l see.
- But will you not now be making your putt?
- Aye
Congratulations, Mr McElroy.
An outstanding round of golf.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
Well!
l can tell you, it's the first time
that's been seen on the 1 8th green.
