Kit!
Kit!
- Two dollars.
- Okay.
- Mark.
- Coming.
Hey, the plate!
Sir.
Tastes good?
Are you alright?
- Here, go see a doctor.
- Thanks, Mark.
Can you read that?
What?
It's all in English.
You're good at bullshitting.
Your English has improved.
- You can even say "Of course"!
- Of course!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Good morning.
- Good morning, Mark.
- That's "Brother Mark".
Mr. Yiu.
Ho, you're back.
Everything okay?
- I already checked it.
- Great.
It's easy dealing with the foreigners.
They are not all trustworthy.
You trust people too easily.
Thanks.
You're Shing? Take a seat.
No, thanks, I'll stand.
Good morning, Linda.
Rose!
Shing, you can learn a lot from Ho.
He is the most loyal.
Yes, he can teach me a lot.
Mark is a bit frivolous, but he is loyal.
Yes, he takes good care of me.
What's that?
Nothing, we're just talking about you.
Really?
Your brother, Kit, graduates today.
Oh, yeah!
I forgot to get him a present.
I gotta go.
Ho, take Shing with you to Taiwan
day after tomorrow.
Give the youngster a change.
Taiwan! You got the guts?!
I've been at this for years,
and I'm still afraid. Know why?
The drills, choppers, Taiwan gangs!
Even the beer drinking can kill you!
- Don't make fun of him.
- Okay.
So, Kit graduated...
get him a woman for a gift!
No, I won't let him go astray like us.
Hey, it's better than getting a hooker.
I want to see him
get a doctorate degree...
...and see him get married...
See him consummate his marriage,
have a baby...
...then his life will be even harder!
They say, "One with a dirty mouth
steps on shit entering an elevator! "
You first.
I won't! Let's step in together!
Don't move. Police!
- Search!
- Yes, sir.
Don't move!
- Don't joke with me.
- Turn around.
We both have guns.
If you don't respect me,
I won't respect you.
Let's see who is not
respecting the other.
That tickles! Don't...
Enough!
Enough.
Brother, I have some good news.
I've been accepted to become
a Police Inspector. Surprised?
It'll be hard work.
You'll be Police Commissioner
one day.
Jackie!
She's my girlfriend.
She helps take care of dad.
My big brother.
Hi.
Don't worry, dad's in good hands.
- Thank you very much.
- Don't mention it.
It's time for my audition!
A new girlfriend...
I hope this time it'll last.
It'll depend on how she behaves.
You said you would go with me.
Hurry up!
I'd love to stay, but...
No need to explain, get out of here!
Excuse me.
- Let's go.
- Hurry up!
Bye.
- Ho...
- Dad.
You should get out of the business.
Your brother has no idea
what you are doing.
I remember when you kids played
"Cops & Robbers" together.
Even when he lost...
...he still wanted to be the cop.
I don't want to see you two brothers
play this game for real.
Give it up for the sake of
your brother.
- Okay?
- Alright.
It's about time.
- Sorry, the traffic was horrible.
- A real traffic jam.
I'm Jackie.
- Give me a chance, please!
- Give her a chance!
- Careful, she's pregnant!
- Are you alright?
Sir, the traffic was awful!
- Please give her a chance?
- Okay.
Alright, go, go ahead!
Pregnant and getting
pushed like that...
Hey, panel judges, please listen.
Sorry.
It's all your fault! You embarrassed
me before I went on stage!
You can't help in any way!
You don't even have confidence
in yourself. How can I help?
They didn't say you failed.
You don't know it's hopeless.
Give that back to me!
Now it's really hopeless!
Have you decided?
One last job, then I'll quit.
Because of Kit?
That deal in Taiwan tomorrow,
you better not go.
If anything happens to me there,
you can take care of things here.
You will lead the Brothers
in the future.
I cannot do that.
Let Shing do it.
He looks just like a Godfather.
Mark, stop fooling around!
Ho, we can't do it without you.
I still have much to learn from you.
You really think you can learn this?
Don't think reading gangster books
will make you the boss.
Have you ever had a gun
pointed at your head?
No.
Twelve years ago...
Twelve years already.
For the first time, I went with Ho
to bring goods to Indonesia.
The Boss there treated us to
dinner in the night club.
I said something wrong,
displeasing the Boss...
...and there were two
guns pointing at my head.
I was forced to drink
a bottle of whisky.
I was so scared, I pissed my pants!
Fortunately, Ho drank the whole
bottle of whiskey for me.
But, it got even worse after that.
Four guns were pointed at my head.
You know what they made me drink?
Piss!
Drink piss in a night club!
You want to learn? That's learning!
That's how we got through
our first job.
That's all in the past,
forget about it.
No.
I had never cried before.
That was the first time I cried.
I swore I'd never let anyone
point a gun at my head again!
How's that?
Careful!
Practice more with your sand bag.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
Disappearing as usual.
I'll be back soon.
While I'm away,
take good care of dad.
Sure.
Take care.
I will.
They're coming, move!
Hurry!
Careful, something's wrong.
- How do you know?
- Intuition.
- Mr. Sung, how are you?
- Where is Mr. Wang?
Sick. I'm his nephew.
He asked me to meet with you.
How are you?
What's wrong with him?
Mr. Sung, let's go in first.
It's nothing serious. The police
are quite alert these days...
...and it's better for him to lay low.
- Have a cup of tea.
- Thanks.
Mr. Sung, this way please.
Come in, please, have a seat.
Let's not waste any more time.
Head quarters, please run a check
on a car numbered 1 0863 79.
Mr. Sung, you really keep your word.
When I was a kid, I admired you.
Can you believe someone is
giving me triple pay to kill you?
He's crazy, who does he think I am?
Let me get your money.
The police are coming!
Hello?
Uncle...
Sung Tse Ho has killed
some of our Brothers in Taiwan.
Now, the police are after him...
...and our boss is afraid he'll talk.
You're coming with me.
I don't want to use force.
You bastard!
If you hurt my son, I'll hunt
you down till the day I die!
Run, quickly run!
What are you doing? Don't! Don't!
No, don't!
Hello, hello? Wrong number!
Uncle, let's go!
Uncle!
Jackie, what's happening?
Kit, watch out!
Dad, don't come out!
Dad! Dad, don't!
Dad!
Dad!
Kit, you have to... forgive...
your brother...
Who betrayed me?
You?
Ho, if I betrayed you,
I wouldn't be here with you.
I don't know if I'll escape this time.
Ho, what are you doing?
- Ho...
- Surrendering.
You can't go, Ho! Don't go.
You shouldn't go out there.
Ho, don't. Don't go out there!
Go! Run!
- Ho...
- Go!
I won't let you get caught.
Gun shots are coming from inside!
- Go!
- I don't want to!
I'm telling you to go!
Stand up and don't move!
Don't move!
Put down the gun!
Put down the gun!
Brotherhood and ethics do not seem
to exist in our world anymore.
No one is trustworthy anymore.
Little Wang really is my nephew...
...but he has betrayed me as well.
He hooked up with
a new force in Hong Kong...
...and is trying to take over
my business.
Sung Tse Ho went down
because of him.
On principle, we strictly
respect loyal friends.
And we won't forgive those
who betray us.
Hello?
Yes.
Tonight he will be at
Fung Lim Kok Restaurant.
Is there anything else
I can do to help?
Do you need some extra men?
Take care.
Thanks.
Captain!
Captain, this way.
I'm not scared.
My boss will bail me out.
Come on, drop your gun
and let's fight.
Then we'll see who is stronger.
- Yes, sir, what is it?
- Nothing.
Mr. Sung, what's up?
Drug trafficking, resisting arrest,
assault.
- Not very smart.
- Take his statement.
Thanks!
How's it going? It's a lot different
on the outside, isn't it?
Need a lift?
No, thanks.
We're going different directions.
I admire you.
Your loyalty. Three years in jail
and you haven't said a word.
What's crazy is while
you were inside...
...the counterfeit money was
still being printed.
Thanks!
I've retired.
Tell your friends...
...that case three years ago isn't
closed yet. I'm not giving up.
Once a thief, it's not easy
to turn your life around.
Bye.
I won't be back.
Stop!
Kit, calm down!
Stop fighting!
Kit, stop it!
Don't let me see you again!
You the manager?
There's no manager here.
I'm Ken. What do you want?
Ken, Uncle Chung from Taiwan
told me to come to you.
I was doing business in Taiwan...
You were in jail, not doing business.
Uncle Chung asked me to
give you this letter in person.
Uncle Chung never has
anything good for me.
But we are good old friends.
It's very difficult for an
ex-con to find a job.
Who wants to employ an ex-con?
No need to get depressed.
Everyone here has been in jail
before.
Some people like to adopt orphans...
...I like to take care of ex-convicts!
You see, I also have been
in prison before.
Colleagues...
...this brother has just been
released.
Take good care of him.
- He is... you are...
- Sung Tse Ho.
Brother Ho!
Oh no, just call me Ho.
What are you doing? Trying to win
favors? Get back to work!
I'm not paying you to stand around!
- You got a driver's license?
- No.
I don't care if you get one or not.
Just stick around here for now.
- Ken, you're very kind.
- Don't worry about it.
There is no boss here.
Mark.
Why did you lie to me in your letters?
Mark, even if both my two legs
were broken...
...I could never make it up to you.
Idiot, I just had some bad luck,
don't worry about it.
I'm so happy to see you again!
It's been so long!
You still look good.
Mark, this is not our world anymore.
Why are you still staying here?
I've waited for you for three years.
Three years, already!
We can start over again!
Don't worry about me.
Look after your brother.
He's been following Shing everyday.
It's getting dangerous.
Anyhow, you two are real brothers.
Kit, we all know you are very
capable.
In fact, I'd like you to be promoted,
but the higher-ups don't approve.
Why?
This guy. You know him well.
We thought he had
disappeared for good.
But he was just released from jail
and is back in town.
- He's with his old brothers again.
- How does that affect me?
This is an investigation
of corruption in the police force.
And we can't have officers
with relatives in the crime world.
Now do you understand?
When I'm on duty...
...I never think of him as my brother.
Kit...
...you're off the Shing case.
I can't allow anything to ruin it.
Mr. Sung, Shing is meeting
the Thai men tonight.
Brothers, cheers!
- Mark, tell us some of your stories!
- Ho, you tell.
My Boss says the maximum price
is 1 8 million, no more.
Okay, okay.
Sung Tse Ho's group is outside.
Beer, please.
Bye.
Our Boss is over there.
Ho!
You didn't let us know you're back!
What kind of a friend are you?
We were once good brothers.
Right, Mark?
Ho, if you hadn't taken care of me,
I wouldn't be where I am today.
Don't be silly, you've worked hard.
I don't have that kind of power.
It's thanks to Mark,
the position opened up for me.
Mark, should you ever need my help,
feel free to call me.
No more bullshit,
come on, let's drink!
You really take good care
of your brothers!
Come on, cheers!
This glass is for my leg!
Happy?
Ho, call me when you have time.
We have lots to discuss.
I'm not interested.
You will be.
I have to go now.
Sung Tse Ho!
Step outside with me.
What are you doing?
What did Shing tell you?
Just bullshit.
Don't lie to me!
Is it business or bullshit?
Really bullshit!
- Are the goods arriving soon?
- I don't know.
Where is it unloading? And when?
I don't know.
You don't know anything!
How can you be the boss?
Kit...
Don't ever call me Kit again,
say Officer!
Officer...
...I haven't been the Boss
for a long time.
Where do you work?
United Taxi Co.
A regular job?
Robbing with a taxi?
- Where do you live?
- United Taxi Co.
Someone's willing to take in
a thief like you!
You bastard! "Thief"?!
He has a name!
Just because you have a gun...
Touch me again and I'll kill you,
you cripple!
Kid, do not point a gun at my head.
If you've got the guts, kill me!
Shoot me... shoot me!
Kit...
...Officer, I know I owe you a lot.
Can you give me another chance?
Give you another chance?
I'm the one who needs
another chance!
Because of you, I've lost
any chance of promotion!
Because you're a gangster!
You'd better not leave Hong Kong.
I'll be watching you!
Break time!
Thank you, Ken!
Don't thank me, it's deducted
from your salary!
You're so mean!
Hey, I've got a wife to support.
