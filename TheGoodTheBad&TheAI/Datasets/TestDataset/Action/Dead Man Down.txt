It wasn't meant to
be this way. You know?
Life is what happens
to you along the way.
You know, at first,
I didn't want this.
I didn't want to
get involved.
"This is what life is. This is
why we're here, to connect.
We're here
to build something.
And then I understood
that she was right.
We're not meant
to be alone.
You know what
she said to me?
She said that even
the most damaged heart
I can't let you in
until Alphonse is home.
I told you that you
should always have it on!
She said that she
didn't turn it off.
DARCY: What the fuck?
This shit is crazy.
And get that asshole from the
alarm company over here.
I know who's
doing this to me.
A little uncouth to
come without a call.
There's a better
place for you to be.
Paul? Everyone
knows Paul's missing.
I want you to think
before you answer.
'Cause I'm getting
to the bottom of this.
Not being able to leave
my house without wondering
if some coward is gonna
sneak up behind me and...
And I think he found exactly
what he was looking for.
But before he
could come and tell me,
my friend Paul shows up
strangled in my freezer.
You've got a lot of enemies,
don't you, Alphonse?
Three months ago you and
I had our disagreement!
to allow you to continue
to operate in my buildings.
I started getting letters
three months ago!
That's no fucking
coincidence!
You asked for 30%, and Lon told
you, you could only ask me for 20%.
So if anyone was bent out of shape,
it was fucking you, Alphonse.
I don't fucking know. Who the
fuck is in this picture?
What am I supposed
to realise?
What does 719 mean?
What am I going to fucking realise?
What am I gonna
fucking realise?
Darcy, want to give me
a hand here, mate?
He ain't got shit
to do with this!
I've been picking up from
Harry for over a year.
No. He's a fucking liar
so you shut the fuck up.
I'm gonna ask you again.
What am I supposed to realise?
I don't care what you
think I've done to you,
you are not sanctioned
to kill me.
That much
I do fucking know.
So it's not on,
you even coming here!
It's you fucking English.
You always do shit like that.
You also make your
sevens like this.
What the fuck
y'all waiting for?
DOCTOR: A bit better
this time.
NURSE: Will you be all right to
drive yourself home, Beatrice?
Why don't you go over and
introduce yourself to him?
Oh, Mom.
What are you doing?
You're supposed to
lie down and relax.
I was relaxing so much
I saw a white light.
Well, if you see it again,
don't walk into it.
I still have a lot of things to
take out on you for my childhood.
I love the colour.
You don't stop looking at him.
You should ask him out.
I was wondering if I
put it in the wrong box?
I thought it would be
nice to finally meet you.
I talk enough
for both of us.
I talk too much.
Everybody says so.
- Yeah?
- Sure.
I worked very hard
to get rid of it.
Right now I'm
dabbling in real estate.
The people I work for, they buy
buildings in need of renovations.
I was involved in
a car accident last year.
But it's kind of hard
to give advice on beauty now.
I have to smile
a lot in my job.
Most of the time,
it hurts to smile.
I don't get to smile
so much in my work.
- No?
- No.
- Maybe you and I should switch jobs.
- Yeah.
I want to
take you somewhere.
- No?
- Very cold.
- Very cold.
- Yeah.
Well, then are
we going to a park?
Must be the company.
Usually, I don't.
You're afraid I'll think you came
tonight because you felt sorry for me.
You don't have to
play these games, Victor.
You want to find out if the girl who's
been watching you saw what you did.
Now you're trying to clean up a
mess that cannot be cleaned up.
I think your secret
will be safe with me.
who hit my car
when he was drunk.
This is the man
who did this to me.
As you did with
the man in your apartment.
- Wait a minute.
- No.
If you don't do it, I'll call the
police and tell them what I saw.
As if it had
never happened.
Three weeks for
what he did to me.
Stupid judge, he sat there
and he looked at my face.
If you don't do it,
I'll call the police
You want to save yourself?
Do it!
- He didn't pay.
- I understand.
Stop saying that!
I understand!
What I did, it has
nothing to do with you.
I have nothing.
I am nothing.
I want it done
as soon as possible.
And I will forget
that I ever met you.
Do you know what it is
to kill a man?
I will forget
that I ever met you.
It's not a bug!
It's not a rat!
I would never
kill a bug or a rat!
He's much worse
than these things!
You don't know what
you're getting into with me!
I could have
called the police.
Now you're gonna
give me back mine.
If you're not going to kill me
you don't have a choice.
Beatrice,
tell me what went wrong.
Sorry I'm late.
No problem.
Were you worried I was
going to forget your name?
Convention.
You forget what it's like.
It's Andras who gave us
the body for your grave.
Someone who
deserved it, I'm sure.
Is this where
the whores are kept?
No, no, you are looking for
your mother's boat. Two down.
Two days after when
they left you for dead.
ANDRAS: Soviet modified
Dragunov.
With all Russian PSO scopes.
Comes with bayonet suppressor as well.
For 14 months you've
infiltrated Alphonse.
why you've been waiting for so
long to do what needs to be done.
He said if he was lucky enough
to be standing, like you are,
But we're all worried
you wait too long.
Always kill the devil quickly when you find him.
That was his advice.
I said you wanted to be close
enough to watch him suffer.
But I really don't know
the reason you're waiting.
So now...
Now.
Say it
in English for me.
VICTOR:
VICTOR:
Your shoe?
Bigger smile than that.
That's not the biggest smile you have.
Nothing. No one
has seen your brother.
It's been two weeks,
I am telling you.
He never goes more than a few
days without calling me.
You know him. Sometimes
he likes to get away.
If you let me go,
he will spare you.
My brother, he will
not stop looking for me.
You don't know who
you're messing with!
If you put a bag over your head,
we might hook up with you.
You have to
take off your shoes.
My mom likes to
keep the floor clean.
BEATRICE: How long
will it take?
Long enough
to be prepared.
You say he goes to
this bar every night?
As much as I
could find out, I did.
I never thought
about it before.
But when I saw you kill
that man in your apartment,
I just want to
know more about you.
She can't hear us. She lost
most of her hearing as a child.
Oh, I forgot my
cookies in the oven.
I took them out
for you, Mom.
I'm looking for
my hearing aids.
Mom, I'd like you
to meet Victor.
You want to stay
for lunch?
We're having chicken. Lemon chicken.
It's very good.
We love cookies
in this house.
Oh, I want to show
you something.
You can see she
has excellent genes.
You see
how beautiful she is?
I want it done as
soon as possible.
VALENTINE: Yes.
You'll hear from me
when it's done.
- Cookies.
- Uh...
It's for you.
Take them.
Him, I have
a good feeling about.
Information is power,
my friend.
You see anyone
take a photo up there?
Another guy.
A guy like you.
GORDON:
You know,
people are flipping out.
You weren't sanctioned
to do Harry.
Or his men. Or leave a house
full of dead Jamaicans!
- No, I told you...
-
- Look, Lon...
-
No. You need to
come see me right now.
You don't appreciate
the severity of this.
You come now.
I'm gonna be at Cafe Cora.
for the last three months,
Harry was messing with me.
Sending little notes
like this
with pictures, and threats
and fucked-up shit.
I don't think he was too happy
with the percentage deal.
I went in there
to get answers,
And truth is, I could have been
just as dead as both of them.
You know Joe Bragg?
And Herbert?
Lowell Khan.
And Weinberg?
Yo, Vic.
Where you at?
I'm in the middle
of something.
This was not Harry and
his men doing this shit.
You know Cafe Cora?
Can you get there?
Yeah, look, Alphonse is
there with Lon Gordon.
I'm gonna call
the rest of the crew
and get them down there,
all right?
How'd you know
it wasn't Harry?
I'm gonna look at
these photos another way.
'Cause whoever's doing this is
taking it seriously enough now
to let us know that the loans
to you, they're not secure.
That's respect enough
to let us know his intentions.
You may not be
around to collect.
Lon, that's exactly what
Harry wanted you to think.
Englishmen and Jamaicans, they
don't send notes like this.
You know what
that key is for?
I want you to get
the books and the deeds
together for me now,
all right?
Every building
you owe us for.
You understand this,
don't you?
So the uptown buildings, you're
pulling out of the deal?
We're not
pulling out, Alphonse.
You're just in no condition
right now to pull in.
TERRY: Alphonse...
- Not right now.
- He's here.
- What?
MAN 1: Oh, shit!
MAN 2: Blotto's down. Get the shit!
Darcy! It's coming
from the roof!
Get the fuck
out of here!
Luco! You watch the elevator!
Goff and Charles,
come upstairs!
Kilroy, back stairs
with me! Now!
Darcy, he got out
from the fifth floor.
- What?
- He went out the window!
Darcy!
What the fuck?
Shit! Fuck!
DARCY: They wasted
Charles, too.
What the fuck
are you doing?
Turn the fuck around!
Turn the fuck around!
- What the fuck!
- Hi. I'm Beatrice.
I'm sorry
I made him late.
DARCY: Did you see anyone run here, Vic?
- No.
- He took out Blotto, Goff and even Charles.
- Who?
Tell him what you
told me about the cab.
DARCY: This guy
in the building,
he saw a man take this photo
from the stairwell.
Then they see him get into a cab.
A gypsy cab.
Paul was there, too.
He found out the same thing.
It must've led him to something,
because he was wasted for it.
Find out where
the cab went.
Go looking
with the pictures.
You've only been on this crew
a month longer than I have.
What if all this shit
that's happening to Alphonse
is because of something that
went down before you came, huh?
This is an opportunity of
magnumus proportions to me.
Of finding my next step
in the organisation.
Yeah, well, there might not be
much of an organisation left.
I could run this place
for him, Victor.
Better than Terry, a whole lot
better than fucking Kilroy.
If I could just
crack this shit for...
This is serious shit,
Darcy.
Have enough money to buy Lise
and Theo what they need.
It's Lise's car.
Mine's in the shop.
What? Are you back
with her?
I promised her I'd
make a plan. Get ahead.
You saw what happened
to Paul.
I don't want anything
to happen to you.
I'm tired of being
taken for a fucking douche.
- I saw Alphonse respected me back there.
- Oh, yeah?
- All right. We're good.
- That's it.
I tied
my shoe today.
Hello. This is Victor,
is Beatrice...
Hello. This is Victor.
ls Beatrice there?
What? There's no answer,
no one is there.
I believe you have
something of mine?
I wanted to find out
more about you.
A few years ago my wife
and I came to America.
We took an apartment
in a building.
It was a building
they wanted to control.
They got most people
out of the building.
One night they came
and they fired some shots.
and my daughter was
killed while she slept.
We were going to testify.
My wife and I.
The man responsible
for it all, Alphonse,
he gave his orders to make
sure he never went to trial.
He was afraid to
use his own guys,
so they sent a crew
of Albanians after us.
and they thought
they killed me, too.
And they should
have made sure of it.
When I manage to forget
what happened to me,
when there are no mirrors,
and no people that reminds me,
That it's these moments
that makes the pain bearable.
I should try and find them where
I can and hang onto them.
and I'm filled
with so much hate
so I want to set
the whole world on fire.
I'm sorry I made you tell me
about your family.
I don't want to be one of those
people that reminds you.
When you're the one who is
going to help me forget.
These men, they don't
seem easy to beat.
And you might have used
up all your luck. So...
- It's yellow...
- Uh-uh.
Rabbits don't
come in chartreuse.
I only ask you to
return the Tupperware.
Because I realise now that if I call
the police and tell them what I saw,
It's not prison
you're afraid of.
It's that you won't get
to finish your revenge.
I'm going to
sleep in my own bed.
And why are you going to
sleep in your own bed?
Because Daddy keeps
care of the monsters.
Why, baby?
Tell me once more, why?
Because Daddy keeps
care of the monsters.
Bigger smile than that!
That's not the biggest smile you have.
And why are you going
to sleep in your own bed?
Because Daddy
keeps care of the monsters.
Why, baby?
Tell me once more. Why?
Because Daddy keeps
care of the monsters.
I'm so happy
that you're here.
I just needed
some time, Florence.
I was worried when you
didn't contact my friend.
- Nicholas, the therapist.
- Oh, yeah.
He really did wonders
helping me out.
As long as you're
getting the help you need.
TERRY: Open the fucking windows.
It's fucking hot in here.
Hey, Kilroy,
you want something to eat?
Make sure you
keep your cell on.
I don't know
what Al's got going.
GREGOR: Are you sure
it's the AR 43?
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm looking at it right here.
It was installed
two days ago.
Then there is nothing wrong
with your remote.
There's a barrier. Your
signal won't get through.
that is used in most banks
and government buildings.
What is the application
for your trigger?
- Warehouse.
- That's interference.
You will have to be inside
the IR ring, or forget it.
Unless you start from scratch,
go to a new system.
No, I can't do that.
Not enough time.
Too much interference. You
would have to detonate inside.
You lost a wife
and a daughter.
I lost a niece
and her little one.
I don't want
to lose you, too.
How come an engineer knows
so much about guns?
Military service.
Back home.
So, what you said on the phone.
Is that your plan?
To get everybody
into this warehouse?
Yes. Alphonse is
always there.
I just need to get
the Albanians there, too.
But your bombs
doesn't work.
That's one way
of looking at it.
Another is that you don't
care if you get out of there.
Don't worry about it.
I'll be around long enough
to do what you asked me
to do.
I don't want you to do that.
Bring me food.
It would just go to
waste otherwise.
I'll wedge it in between the mustard
and those plastic explosives.
You may not care if
you get out alive,
but in the meantime,
you should eat.
My rabbit's foot. If you don't
believe in it, I'll take it back.
Ilir.
Same bogus
return address again.
Hello?
- Hey, it's Fonz. Listen.
He says he can close the financing
on those uptown buildings.
And he don't know anything
about Lon pulling out.
He wants to see
the Commerce Building.
So I'm gonna meet him
there tonight at 9:00.
I don't know, man. What
if our problem shows up?
Pulls some fucking
"I don't know" kind of shit.
No, you're
the only one that knows.
- Yeah.
- Yo, Vic. You with anybody?
- Yeah. I'm busy.
- Well, drop your dick.
The guy at
the cab company says
he remembers Paul.
Paul was there.
I'm like
a detective, man.
Like Columbo.
I'm scaring myself.
- Vic? Right.
-
DARCY: Hey, Vic. Vic.
This girl you're seeing.
Hey, you never
mentioned her before.
Yeah, I'm embarrassed
about you.
- You're embarrassed about your friends?
- Huh? Fuck you talking about?
So. This is it
right here.
The cab dropped
off Paul right here.
You're sure?
Yeah.
They keep a track,
drop offs, pick-ups.
All right, detective?
Can we leave now?
The office is closed tomorrow.
But I could call them.
Maybe I'll come by
with a picture of Paul.
See if anybody
knows anything.
Come on.
I gotta get out of here.
Yeah. I just got some
business to take care of.
Your text said not to
tell anyone I was coming.
I said whoever walks
through that door at 9:00
was going to have
a real bad night.
The person doing
this to me, he's hurt.
Like the people
in the picture.
And he's in a great deal
of pain because of that.
And it's a pain
that I've caused.
And found
he was in both feet.
Victor, I want him
to know something.
if there's anything left in this
world that he still cares about,
He's probably wondering right
now what I'm thinking.
Wouldn't you be wondering
what I'm thinking?
You know, you're the only
one I can trust, Victor.
Because you saved
my life at Harry's.
It would be something,
though.
If you saved my life only
to be the one who kills me.
You told me that
if I helped you...
Believe what I say,
my friend.
You're asking me these things, so I
know you've been thinking about it.
Listen to me. You're
in the city. All right?
You're in the basement
of my boss's warehouse.
His name is Alphonse.
Alphonse Hoyt.
I don't know what your brother
or his men did to him,
but they're gonna kill you
whether he pays or not.
You can record a message for your brother.
I'll make sure he gets it.
- We gotta go fast.
- Thank you.
Tell him where you are. It's important
you tell him where you are.
I'm alive, brother. I don't
know for how much longer.
They're going to kill me. Even if you pay
them the money, they're going to kill me.
They're holding me in a warehouse
that belongs to Alphonse Hoyt.
I beg you. I beg you,
brother, come quickly.
A warehouse that belongs to Alphonse Hoyt...
Alphonse Hoyt!
We killed you.
We killed you all!
I swear on their graves,
you didn't.
I swear! I swear on
their graves, you didn't!
Don't let me die like this!
Please! Please!
Don't let me die like this!
Please!
- Yeah.
- Yo, I tracked down the manager.
- What manager?
-
I thought it was
closed today.
He's gonna be here in 15. Says he
needs to feed some fish or some shit.
I can meet him alone,
if you're busy.
- All right.
I need to send
this package.
But I gotta take care of
something I didn't count on,
You don't need to
know what it is.
It's a video.
It's one of the Albanians
saying something
I need him to say
to the person I
need him to say it to.
You need to get a tracking number.
With alerts to my cell phone.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Tell your mother
it was very good.
Hey, this shit's coming together.
It's a list of all
the people buried here.
The guy said he was more interested
in the Hungarian section.
The Hungarian section.
Did he say why?
That girl you told me about
across the way from you.
The one who found
you before got lucky.
And just because
he found the grave
doesn't mean that they will
figure it out as well.
I know why you've
been waiting so long.
I think you're afraid
that when it's over,
It was going to waste.
I just felt like putting it on.
- Hey, monster!
- Hey!
Get out of here!
Come on!
- I fell and ruined a nice dress.
- Let me see.
At least it
wasn't my good side.
I have your
tracking number.
- Hello, Victor.
- Hello.
Go take off your dress,
it's covered in blood.
He shouldn't
see you like this.
- Thank you for returning my Tupperware.
- Of course.
People usually don't.
Like it comes with the food.
Free Tupperware.
It was very good.
Beatrice didn't tell you?
She was nervous you
wouldn't like her cooking.
I always told her the way to a man's
heart is through his stomach.
She'll keep you well fed.
That's for sure.
You know, this thing, me
falling and hitting my head?
Maybe it happened because
I lost my rabbit's foot.
The truth is my mom gave it
to me after the accident.
She said it was going to bring
me luck with my procedures.
Would you go out
with me tonight?
- Yeah.
DARCY:
Laszlo Kerik?
You know the name?
- No. No, I don't know him.
- I didn't think you would.
I've been searching every dead
Hungarian on this cemetery list.
This shit went down about nine
months before we were on the crew.
There was a case involving
Alphonse and a little girl
Who was killed in
one of his buildings.
The case never went to
trial. Get this, right?
The little girl's
mommy and daddy,
they died,
like, two months afterwards.
They're buried
right there next to her.
- Yeah. I'm here.
-
I found out exactly what
Paul must have found out.
Look, I want to tell Alphonse. I want
you to be there when I tell him.
No, I'm in the middle of something.
I'll talk to you later.
I didn't know you were coming. I
would have thrown something on.
, you knew very
well he was coming.
No, you didn't
tell me anything.
- Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.
- This is...
- The bar.
In his house,
some credit card receipts.
He usually leaves the bar at 8:30 every night.
But he took a trip.
I want to
make sure he's back.
If he's here tonight, he'll
probably be here tomorrow night.
It's not gonna
end up that way.
I wore that
white dress for you.
All right, wait here.
I'll be back in a minute.
So you're saying
it's someone who knew them?
The little girl
died June 17th.
Yeah, I'm walking
back to him now. Okay.
Hey, you know
who this is, right?
I've been getting these weird
letters for the last three months.
With pictures?
With the eyes crossed out?
Whoever is doing it
took my brother.
You remember this problem
I had you take care of for me?
You stayed to the finale.
Right?
And the whole
family took a bow?
And you're sure you saw
the father take a bow?
Where the fuck have you been?
I've been trying to call you.
Some shit's
going down, man.
The fucking thing
won't start.
- Come pick me up.
- What?
Bring every
fucking gun we have.
- Brozi?
- Here?
You didn't kill him because
you feel something for me.
And the guy walked away,
and I called him back.
I called him back, because
I feel something for you.
So I thought that if
I could just mess up
one of your things,
just one thing,
it would be enough so it wouldn't
work out the way you planned.
So I put my rabbit's
foot in that package.
They got my
rabbit's foot instead.
We travel by night. I don't
care how far we have to go.
Where are you going?
You come back here!
Your father is
speaking to you.
I'm gonna wait
for you here.
I'm outside your apartment.
Come back. Please.
Beatrice, I want you to
go to your apartment now.
Go there now, and stay there
and wait for me. Okay?
If you fucking scream it will go bang.
Okay? Okay.
You made me a douche, Laszlo Kerik.
I've seen your artwork.
I've seen your fucking pictures.
You put Paul in the freezer.
This has nothing
to do with you.
I sent you to my
apartment to save you.
All right? You weren't
supposed to go inside.
Yeah, but I did go inside.
I was worried about you.
I don't want to
fucking kill you.
Take this opportunity,
and you let her go.
You lied to me.
You fucking lied to me.
You listen to me. You get in
your shitty car that does start.
You start your shitty car. And you
drive your shitty car to Alphonse's.
KILROY: Darcy's here
with the girl.
Yeah, well, she won't be here
when you get here.
Oh, shit.
Motherfucker!
He just shot Luco.
No, look! He's
coming up the back stairs.
All right now! I've got
something for your ass!
Follow him, Ilir!
Down the fucking stairs!
Hey, Victor!
Remember I told you if
there was anything left
you still cared about,
I was gonna find it and I was
gonna burn that shit down.
Hey, where the fuck
did you go?
What the fuck
are you doing, man?
Don't you raise
that fucking gun.
Don't you do it!
Don't you fucking do it!
Bitch,
lower the fucking gun!
Did you choose not to kill me
'cause I got a wife and a kid?
I didn't kill you
because they've got you.
