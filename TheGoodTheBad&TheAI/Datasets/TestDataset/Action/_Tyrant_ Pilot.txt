This is Fauzi Nidal.
Leave a message and
I'll call you back.
Fauzi, it's, uh... it's me again.
Barry.
Um... Bassam.
Uh, I'm not sure if you're
getting my messages,
but, um, I'm coming for
my nephew's wedding.
Uh, arriving tomorrow.
My US cell number
should work, so, uh...
so call me.
It would be good to see you.
Jamal, fix your button.
How do you expect people to respect
you if you can't dress yourself?
Jamal. Bassam.
Come on, Jamal. Come out.
Khaled! Khaled! Khaled!
Khaled! Khaled! Khaled! Khaled!
Khaled! Khaled!
KHALED: Wave, Jamal.
Not like a girl. Wave.
Jamal, go stand over there.
Mr. President.
KHALED: My son will
cut the ribbon.
It is a great honor... to
be standing here with you,
the good people of Ma'an.
This ground, once stained
with the blood and tears
of conflict, has been cleansed
by the sweat of your good work.
This bridge is more than
just steel and concrete.
It is a symbol that despite
our differences...
Get down, Bassam!
BARRY: Hello, Mrs. Shapiro.
MRS. SHAPIRO: I'm sorry to
call so early, Doctor, but
Danny's been coughing all night.
BARRY: Uh, well, uh, Dr. Chang
is covering my patients this week,
so let me give you his service number...
MRS. SHAPIRO: I'm sure he's
fine, but I really trust you.
BARRY: I'm glad you trust me,
but he's an excellent doctor and
I'm about to leave town, s...
MRS. SHAPIRO: I get that you're
busy, but what if he has strep?
BARRY: No, I, uh, I
understand, I do, uh...
I'll be at my office
in ten minutes.
MRS. SHAPIRO: Thank
you, Dr. Al Fayeed.
BARRY: Okay. Bye.
I can't believe you're
making us go to this wedding
when they're burning pictures
of Grandpa on the street.
Emma, get off the Internet.
EMMA: And they burned down the bakery
where the wedding cake was being made.
And you think this is funny?
What if they attack us?
No one's attacking us.
And if they do, we'll
have armed escorts.
Dad's father's like a king.
Em, we're royalty over there.
You know, you'll be like Kate Middleton.
Just fat.
Hey, don't talk to
your sister like that.
Come on.
What part of what I
said isn't true?
- Emma...
- Aw, it's cute.
Seriously, can you just
stop with the attitude
and try to appreciate what an
amazing opportunity this is?
Yeah.
EMMA: It's not
just me, you know.
- Dad doesn't want to go either.
- He told you that?
EMMA: He didn't have to.
Isn't it obvious?
Why do you think he hasn't
been back in 20 years?
He doesn't want to go, and
I don't want to go either.
So I'm not going.
You're going.
That was a long run.
You missed all the fun.
BARRY: Medical emergency.
Danny Shapiro's got strep.
That's why I don't give out
my cell number to patients.
BARRY: Sammy, clear your plate.
SAMMY: Got to finish packing.
Honey, you do realize Emma's
manifesting your negativity.
Maybe on the plane ride, you
can think of something nice
to tell her about your family.
BARRY: They're not my family.
You're my family.
No, see, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.
Of course she's acting out.
All she hears about is how
you don't want to go.
BARRY : Just promise
me we'll come back.
What?
Very funny.
SAMMY: I told you not to take
the 405-- I mean, come on, who
takes the 405?
All right, let's
go, let's move it.
Come on!
Great. You happy now?
We missed our flight.
I'm sure there's another one.
EMMA: Or maybe it's a sign
from Allah that we should go
to Disney World like
every other family.
I'll call the airline. See
if there's another flight.
- Mr. Al Fayeed?
BARRY: - Yes.
- Are you ready to board?
- The plane's still here?
Of course.
BARRY: I'm sorry. Has
everyone else boarded?
You are the only
passengers, sir.
Your father bought all the
other seats on the plane.
- Good morning.
SAMMY: - Good morning.
Oh, wow.
This is what I'm talking about.
I think I like this.
A whole plane?
SAMMY: Oh, no. No, wait, wait.
All right, this one.
Oh, man. Look at this.
Thank you, Grandpa.
BARRY: Okay, guys,
get up, please.
These aren't our seats.
SAMMY : Y-You're
kidding, right?
BARRY: No, get up.
We're gonna sit in the
seats that we paid for.
Isn't this a little crazy?
BARRY: This is what's crazy.
I say no to his private
jet, so he does this.
And I'm-I'm not gonna be
manipulated like that.
No way.
Honey, your father'll
never know.
BARRY: Fine.
Sit wherever you want.
EMMA: It's okay.
I'll go sit with Dad.
No. Stay here.
I'm in the window seat.

Oh.
How long have I been out?
BARRY: Couple hours.
Mmm.
So no turning back, huh?
If it makes a difference, I'm
really happy we're doing this.
BARRY: Well, I'm happy
when you're happy.
See, I see a real
opportunity here.
To finally sit down
with your father.
Tell him everything you've
been carrying around
in your head all these years.
BARRY: Yeah, you don't
know my father.
I know you.
I see you're awake.
Yes.
What do you have there?
Dom Pérignon Rosé
Oenothèque 1990.
Your brother, Jamal, insisted
we have it on board for you.
To your brother, Jamal.
BARRY: To my brother.
Why you didn't get me?
My wife just called.
My brother's landing
in ten minutes.
Go inside...
seesaw swingin'
with the boys in the
school and your feet
flyin' up in the air
singin' "Hey, diddle-diddle"
with your kitty in the middle
on the swing
like you didn't care...
so I took a big chance
at the high school
dance with a missy
who was ready to play
wasn't me she was foolin'
'cause she...
It's incredible.
Salaam alaikum.
BARRY:
So good to see you, Bassam.
So good you could all come.
We've been looking
forward to it.
I trust the flight
was satisfactory?
BARRY: There was, uh,
plenty of legroom.
Your father insisted.
You are still an Al Fayeed.
There are security
considerations.
dream on, dream on
dream on, dream on, dream on
oh...
Little brother.
BARRY: Jamal.
JAMAL: You look pale.
What's the matter?
No sun in California?
When we went to Disney,
there was plenty of sun.
Molly.
: Hey, Jamal.
Miss America.
MOLLY: Jamal.
JAMAL: Beautiful as ever.
MOLLY: Thank you.
JAMAL: Emma.
Come to your uncle.
My little mermaid.
Sammy.
Sammy, my fishing buddy.
SAMMY: Hey, Uncle Jamal.
JAMAL: So tall.
I just bought a Mikelson Nomad.
Have you heard of this boat?
SAMMY: No.
JAMAL: Fastest thing
you've ever seen.
After the wedding, we'll take
her out and catch some tuna.
SAMMY: All right.
JAMAL: Come. Let's
go to the palace.
MOLLY: Look, Em,
there's a Subway.
And I read they just built
a great mall downtown.
It's really not that
different from home.
SAMMY: Except
there's no traffic.
EMMA: They're holding it, stupid.
Because of us.
Sweet.
Check out Grandpa
on the billboard.
KHALED: You can't kill me!
Here I am!
I'm right here!
You can't kill me!
SAMMY: Holy shit.
You grew up here?
BARRY: Yeah.
SAMMY: I can't believe
you'd ever leave.
JAMAL: I was already at the
airport when you called.
Mm-hmm.
Hello, Bassam.
BARRY: Leila.
LEILA: Molly. Welcome.
MOLLY: Congratulations
on the wedding.
You must be so proud.
LEILA: We are very proud, yes.
And we're so happy you've come.
All of you.
Your father is waiting.
MOLLY: We're fine.
Go ahead.
LEILA: Who wants to
jump in the pool?
SAMMY: I don't mind.
I-I could do that.
KHALED: Bassam.
BARRY: Father.
You look well.
KHALED: Been so long.
Too long.
BARRY: Well, um... between, uh,
between work and the kids' schedules,
it's, um...
KHALED: I'm sure.
You're a busy man.
Your father's been so excited
to see you, he's barely slept.
KHALED: I need a
moment with Jamal.
Then we'll take a walk.
Just you and me.
Jamal. We just heard from
our sources in Ma'an.
Terrorists are planning
to attack the wedding.
JAMAL: I don't understand.
I told Yussef to pay Walid
to keep them quiet.
KHALED: Did I ask
you for excuses?
JAMAL: I'll have Ziad round
up the troublemakers.
KHALED: And tomorrow, 10,000
people will be protesting
in the square.
Don't be a fool, Jamal.
Talk to Walid yourself.
Make sure he understands
there will be consequences
if he can't control
his own people.
And bring your brother.
JAMAL: Why?
KHALED: Because I told you to.
I wish you'd reconsider.
You're... You're here
for such a short time.
It seems silly for you to
be staying in a hotel.
BARRY: Well, we, uh, we already made the...
the reservations, so...
Cancel them.
BARRY: Mother, please, you... You
asked me to come here and I'm here.
He's changed, Bassam.
As hard as that may be for
you to accept, it's true.
KHALED: How does it feel, being,
uh, home after all these years?
BARRY: Coming through the city,
I barely recognized the place.
Everything's changed.
KHALED: Yes, it has.
Saddam and Gaddafi are dead.
Mubarak is on trial.
Ben Ali, in exile.
BARRY: You're still here.
KHALED: For now. Inshallah.
After everything I've given the
people, they're still not satisfied.
They say they want freedom.
Freedom.
To do what?
Kill each other?
I give them order and prosperity,
and all they want is chaos.
BARRY: Listen, um... Molly and the
kids are still waiting for me.
We need to check into the hotel.
KHALED: Of course.
You didn't come all this way
to hear an old man complain.
It's good to have you
home again, Bassam.
We've been living here for five
years, and as far as we're concerned,
it's paradise, right, baby?
Mm-hmm.
Beaches? Best in the world.
Horses? They've got a racetrack
that blows away Churchill Downs.
We could make a day of it.
MOLLY: Hey, how was it?
BARRY: Uh, it was good.
John Tucker.
I'm with the embassy.
Nice to finally meet you.
BARRY: Finally?
JOHN: Your father talks
about you all the time.
I'm Dana.
I'm with him.
BARRY: - Hi.
DANA: - Hi.
BARRY: Uh, we should
get to the hotel.
MOLLY: Oh, sure. Okay.
See you at the wedding, right?
BARRY: Hey, guys, time to go.
Sammy, out of the pool, please.
JOHN: They're
staying at a hotel?
SAMMY: I just got in!
LEILA: It's complicated.
MOLLY: So how was it
to see your father?
BARRY: I told you.
It was good.
MOLLY: It was good?
BARRY: Yeah, we, um...
we went for a walk.
MOLLY: And?
BARRY: He got old. I'm not sure
what else you want me to say.
Sammy, get out of the pool.
MOLLY: Sammy, you heard your father.
Let's go.
SAMMY: Oh. Well, this is... this
is so much better than the palace.
Look, a minibar.
EMMA: You know, I don't really want to go
to this thing tonight. I'm kind of tired.
MOLLY: Aw, come on, Emma. It'll be fun.
We'll get our hands and feet painted.
You always say you
want a tattoo.
EMMA: Yeah, on my own terms,
not as some creepy patriarchal tradition.
MOLLY: Okay, it's a
bachelorette party.
There's nothing
patriarchal about it.
If you're gonna be unbearable,
at least be accurate.
SAMMY: Does that mean our
thing is the bachelor party?
BARRY: Yeah.
Without the strippers
and the booze.
It's, uh... it's pretty much a
bunch of guys in a steam room
watching the groom get shaved.
Tip the bellboy when he comes.
MOLLY: I'll see you
in the lobby at 6:00.
EMMA: Hating.
SAMMY: Bunch of guys
in a steam room.
Bummer.
EMMA: You better be careful.
This isn't America.
SAMMY: Thanks, Mom.
See?
It's pretty.
She says it's your turn.
EMMA: Oh, that's okay.
I'm good.
Go ahead. It doesn't hurt.
LEILA: So tell me, how did you
finally convince Bassam to come?
MOLLY: I told him it's crazy,
we've been married for 19 years
and I've never seen
where he's from.
He doesn't like to talk
about his childhood much.
I thought by
coming here, maybe...
LEILA: Bassam has always
been a very private person.
JAMAL: Remember, Sammy, the whole
time we were catching fish
and your father was standing
over the railing and...
Like it?
Good, huh?
Bassam, come with me.
BARRY: Where are we going?
JAMAL: To talk to a
tribal leader from Ma'an,
which is still the
asshole of the country.
Yussef paid him to keep things
quiet during the wedding,
but it didn't work.
And now I have to handle it.
BARRY: What do you
mean it didn't work?
JAMAL: Walid's terrorist nephew,
Ihab, he's been causing
trouble ever since he
came back from Syria.
Now he's threatening to
blow up the wedding.
Blow up the wedding? Jamal, I
brought my whole family here.
JAMAL: No worries, Bassam.
I'll handle it.
My friend, the minute I
heard you wanted to see me,
I dropped everything
and came here.
JAMAL: You didn't come,
Walid, my men brought you.
WALID: And here I am.
JAMAL: My father is troubled
by what he's been hearing
about your terrorist
nephew, Ihab.
WALID: People are always
spreading rumors about Ihab.
JAMAL: So he has no plans to
blow up my son's wedding?
WALID: N-Not that I've heard.
JAMAL: But you don't
know for sure.
WALID: Well, look, it's true
that Ihab doesn't share my
- goodwill for your son's wedding...
JAMAL: - I pay you to control him.
WALID: I can only
do what I can do.
- I-I tried talking to him...
JAMAL: - Not hard enough.
WALID: No!
Jamal! Please!
JAMAL: You think you can take our money?
Well, you...
BARRY: Jamal.
JAMAL: I'll take your
fingers one at a time.
BARRY: Jamal! Stop!
Stop! Stop it!
JAMAL: Get off!
BARRY: Listen to me!
You're giving him more reason
to attack than he already has.
JAMAL: You don't
understand, Bassam.
You've been gone too long.
This asshole and his nephew need
to learn there are consequences.
BARRY: Okay, but not like this.
JAMAL: Then how? Tell me.
I'm listening.
BARRY : Talk to him.
JAMAL: Talk to him?
You mean like Oprah.
"How do you feel, Walid?
You had a bad childhood?
Oh, me, too. Let's hug it out."
BARRY: - No, that's not what I mean.
JAMAL: - Then what do you mean?
BARRY: Invite him
to the wedding.
Him and his nephew, Ihab.
Invite his whole family and put one
of them at every single table.
He'll find a way to make
sure no one attacks.
JAMAL: My brother Bassam would
like you and your family
to come to the wedding
as his honored guests.
FAUZI : Bassam.
What the hell are
you doing here?
BARRY: She's beautiful.
Looks just like her mom.
FAUZI: Thank you.
She's very intelligent.
BARRY : So how come
you never called me back?
FAUZI: Do you have any idea
what's happening here, Bassam?
BARRY: I read what you write,
if that's what you're asking.
FAUZI: After the protests
started last year,
your father sent his
tanks into Ma'an.
Dozens of people were
killed, hundreds wounded.
All the international web sites
and papers carried my articles,
yet I never heard
anything from you.
- Well, we never talk about politics.
FAUZI: - 'Cause you don't want to.
If there was ever a time
to come back, it was then.
Instead, you come
back for a wedding.
A wedding that's
costing £10 million.
Your father claims that he's
defending us from the infidels,
the Brotherhood and the Zionists,
while the people in Ma'an go hungry.
BARRY: Come on, you know how
corrupt they are there.
My father is not the
only one to blame.
FAUZI: Of course
you're defending him.
BARRY: Fauzi, what
do you want from me?
- I-I'm a pediatrician.
FAUZI: - You're an Al Fayeed.
They are your family.
BARRY: Yes.
That's why I left.
FAUZI: After I wrote
about the protests,
the  took me in
the middle of the night
and kept me in prison
for three days.
While you're living your American
dream, I dream about this.
I'm sorry if I interfered
with your nostalgia, Bassam.
You should finish your tea.
I have a deadline.
And you have a wedding.
BARRY: It's a little over
the top, don't you think?
JOHN: Are you kidding?
Barry... people can see these
fireworks from 20 miles away.
The fireworks are the
key to the whole thing.
Forget those pricks
from Amnesty.
What your father's done
here is a miracle.
Not counting the Saudis, the
mean per capita income's
country in the Arab League.
Syria, Egypt-- firefights.
Here-- fireworks.
Me, I'll take fireworks.
SAMMY: My name's
Sammy, by the way.
I know who you are.
Abdul.
SAMMY: So, what's
your connection?
ABDUL: My father runs security
for your grandfather.
My grandfather was the head of
security for your great-grandfather.
And my great-grandfather
was the head of security
- for your great-great...
SAMMY: - I get it.
I was just making sure
we're not related.
JAMAL : Whoa-ho-ho!
There he is! My man... Walid!
It's good you are here.
WALID: May Allah keep the bride and
groom in prosperity, and confer
his blessings upon them.
JAMAL: Do you know my
uncle, General Tariq?
WALID: Good to see you,
as always, General.
And you both know
my wife, Nadia.
- And my nephew...
TARIQ: - Ihab.
Did you enjoy the fireworks?
IHAB: Of course.
Who doesn't enjoy fireworks?
: Boom, boom, boom.
JAMAL: Bassam!
Come!
JOHN: Let's go.
BARRY: No, no, I'm-I'm good.
MOLLY: Hey. You've come all
this way after 20 years.
Go on.
JAMAL: You were right.
BARRY: About what?
JAMAL: No attacks.
Look at Walid and his terrorist
nephew, standing like scarecrows.
It's because of you.
You did this.
KHALED: Wait! Wait! Wait!
Take him. Take him.
Jamal.
Jamal... come out here.
Come here.
Come out here, Jamal.
Come out here.
Sometimes you have to make hard
choices to be a good leader.
These are the people who
shelter these dogs,
these traitors who tried to kill us.
Give me this.
Take this. Do it.
Do it, Jamal.
Please. I have a family.
JAMAL: Your turn.
MOLLY: Uh, excuse me.
Where are you going?
BARRY: Uh, just, uh, just,
uh, getting some air.
MOLLY: You were just on the
dance floor with your brother.
What happened?
BARRY: It doesn't matter.
MOLLY: Barry, please stop
telling me it doesn't matter.
JAMAL: He's a good
boy, my Ahmed.
You love him?
That's good. Good.
A girl this beautiful, I'm
sure you had many suitors.
The wedding night
is very special.
It's important to be pure.
It would break Ahmed's heart if
the woman he married wasn't pure.
: There.
There it is.
: Good girl.
Good girl.
BARRY: I'm beginning
to think he's insane.
The thing is, I don't even...
blame Jamal.
I blame our father.
The reason that Jamal is so
broken is because...
my father broke him.
That's what he does.
And...
I'm sorry, I...
I don't want
to dump all this on you.
MOLLY: No. This is good.
It's good that you did.
Now, you need to
tell your father.
BARRY: - Tell him what?
MOLLY: - Everything.
BARRY: That's not gonna
change anything.
It's certainly not
gonna change him.
MOLLY: I'm not asking you to do it
for him, I'm asking you to do it
for you. For us.
BARRY: Us?
MOLLY: Barry... you ran away from
your father when you were 16,
and you're still running.
Since I've known you,
you've been carrying around
this weight that's just
gotten heavier, and...
it's left you... joyless.
I don't know how else to say it.
And if you think that hasn't
affected your relationship
with Emma and Sammy...
with me...
YUSSEF: Bassam.
It's your father.
He's collapsed.
I am afraid the president has
suffered a cerebrovascular injury.
JAMAL: What does that mean?
BARRY: It means a stroke.
Yes.
JAMAL: He'll be fine.
We are doing everything we can.
JAMAL: If he dies, you die.
You are a doctor; you fix him.
Your father asked to see you.
KHALED: My son will
cut the ribbon.
I'm right here!
You can't kill me!
Bassam...
Bassam...
BARRY: It's okay.
Don't try to talk.
KHALED: Listen to me.
Without you, they'll
kill us all.
I was wrong.
It should have been you.
It should have been you, Bassam.
JAMAL: How is he?
What did he say?
BARRY: He wants to talk to you.
You and Mother.
MOLLY: You okay?
Barry?
BARRY: You should
check on the kids.
MOLLY: Okay.
JAMAL: He's gone.
He's gone.
LEILA: Jamal.
Jamal, come...
Where are you going?
Look at me. Look at me.
Now you are in charge.
Okay?
Now it's your time.
You need to be a man.
JAMAL: You're telling
me to be a man?
When was the last time
you were a woman to me?
LEILA: Oh!
Stop it.
JAMAL: You hate me.
I know that.
I love you.
And you hate me.
LEILA: This is... Aah. Jamal.
BARRY: Jamal.
LEILA: Jamal!
President Khaled Al Fayeed's condition
is still unknown at this time.
No official word from the
presidential palace.
The president collapsed at his
grandson's wedding celebration
five hours ago.
BARRY: He's dead.
MOLLY: I'm so sorry.
BARRY: Come on. Let's go.
MOLLY: Okay.
Back to the hotel?
BARRY: - To the airport.
MOLLY: - What...?
BARRY: - We're leaving.
MOLLY: - What are you talking about?
BARRY: We're going home.
MOLLY: Barry.
- We can't just leave.
BARRY: - Come on. Get up.
MOLLY: Honey, we don't
have our passports.
BARRY: That's fine.
We'll stop at the hotel.
Get up, Sammy. Now.
SAMMY: So, what, we're not even
staying for Grandpa's funeral?
BARRY: Sammy, for once,
you do what I tell you.
SAMMY: I want to
see Uncle Jamal.
BARRY: No, I said
we're going now.
EMMA: Sammy, listen to Dad.
SAMMY: I'm not leaving here
until I see Uncle Jamal.
BARRY: Forget Uncle Jamal.
SAMMY: No.
I'm staying here.
BARRY: Now.
MOLLY: What is the
matter with you?
JAMAL: Meet me downstairs.
BARRY: I need four seats on the
next flight to Los Angeles.
In coach, please.
Any airline?
BARRY: Yeah.
Passports. Come on.
JAMAL: What are you looking at?
You want to look at something?
Look at this.
Look at this. Come on.
Yeah.
Mmm.
Yeah.
Good girl.
That's good.
Oh, yeah.
What is this?
Aah!
And once we've reached an
altitude of 10,000 feet,
you'll be able to use all
approved electronic devices.
MOLLY: Okay, we're on the plane.
We're going home.
Are you ready to explain
to me what that was about?
- Barry.
BARRY: - Not now.
MOLLY: Oh, what do
you mean, not now?
You leave without saying
good-bye to your family
- after your father dies. I'm...
BARRY: - They're not my family.
MOLLY: You hit our son.
BARRY: Molly, not now.
MOLLY: No. I'm sick of it.
I never know what
you're thinking.
I never know how you feel
because you never tell me.
We've been married for 19 years.
And you force me to be like
some kind of a mind reader.
Please, look at me.
I feel like I don't know
who you are anymore.
I'm not sure I ever did.
Please.
KHALED: Do it.
Please.
KHALED: Shoot him.
I have a family,
please, no, please.
KHALED: Do it, Jamal.
Please, no.
KHALED: Jamal.
Jamal!
Come back here.
Jamal.
Get out right now.
Get out.
Right now-- get out of the car.
- Jamal, do as I say.

the car, Jamal.
Out of the car!
Get out, Jamal!

Oh!
KHALED: It should have
been you, Bassam.
MOLLY: I mean it, Barry.
I can't do this anymore.
If you don't tell me what's going

I don't know what

Hello, this is your

BARRY: I told you we
shouldn't have come.
