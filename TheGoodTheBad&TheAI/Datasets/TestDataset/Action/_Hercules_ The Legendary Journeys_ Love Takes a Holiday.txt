"And my husband spends
too much time in the tavern
and not enough in our bedroom.
"Please help.
Also, he snores.
Signed, Sleepless in Cyprus."
Ugh!
Another lame request.
Can't these people get a life?
Mmm.
Oh, that's good,
totally good.
Make me forget this stuff.
Aphrodite?
Mm-hmm?
I don't see the point
of rubbing oil on your skin.
Oh, it's just this new process
I've hit on. It gives me
this killer bronze glow.
Here are more petitions
from your shrines.
Ugh!
Dear Goddess.
Single Athenian female...
seeks single Spartan male
for fun and games.
Please send recent sketch--
Yadda, yadda, yadda.
I'm just over this
Goddess of Love gig!
Gag me.
You've had enough?
Absolutely! I am, like,
extremely versatile.
No more hiding
my talents.
They're gonna be out there
for the world to see.
An hour of passion
may soothe you.
Boring!
You bore me!
These bore me.
Love bores me.
I quit!
Something troubles you,
noble Hephaestus?
Only that which
I can never have.
But you must press on,
great God of Fire.
None of the other gods
has your skill and artistry.
No!
Iagos, how do I conquer
my obsession for her?
With work, Master.
I mean, only you can make
the armor for the other gods.
There's a great emptiness
inside me.
That's because you seek
the unattainable. Set your
sights more realistically--
perhaps on
the beautiful Leandra.
My father told me
you once proposed to her.
Yes.
And even she,
a mortal, rejected me.
Hmm. Well, maybe she's,
uh, changed her mind.
- After all, it's been 50 years.
- So much time has gone by.
I must remedy that.
This... shield you're
crafting for Perseus--
Is it as powerful
as it is beautiful?
It will be
when it's finished.
Iagos, I'll lift the curse on
the village of Syllabus today,
but I won't force myself
on Leandra.
Ah! Nor should you
have to.
Uh, let me talk to the girl,
uh, find out how
she really feels.
If you can convince her to
come to me lovingly and freely,
I'll give you
anything I have.
Ah, not necessary.
I live only to serve you.
dd
dd Ahh-ahh-ahh
dd You love dddd
I want you! I love you!
-
Your love isn't strong enough!
- Mine?
- No!
-
Hmm. Must have been
a bad year. Huh!
dd My true lover dd
Oh, shut up!
Oof!
Chrysala!
Why did you do that?
Maybe she's no longer
fond of your... instrument.
- I'm tired of you
and your rags.
- But, dearest--
Get out of my way!
Oof!
-
- Mykonos!
My friend! Come on.
Good to see you,
Iolaus.
Yeah.
Uh, what's going on?
I have no idea.
The women are all
behaving strangely.
Where's Hercules?
Uh, he's in Corinth.
His brother Iphicles's wife
is having a baby,
so it's, uh,
family time for Herc,
R & R for me.
So, have you seen,
uh, Evanthea?
She's, uh, over there,
but, uh, be careful.
Careful? Hmm!
A week with Evanthea is
like a walk in the clouds.
If she's acting like all
the others, you may find
yourself in a thunderstorm.
Evanthea.
Iolaus.
Hi.
This is the story
of a time long ago,
a time of myth and legend,
when the ancient gods
were petty and cruel,
and they plagued mankind
with suffering.
Only one man dared
to challenge their power--
Hercules.
Hercules possessed a strength
the world had never seen,
a strength surpassed
only by the power of his heart.
He journeyed the earth,
battling the minions
of his wicked stepmother, Hera,
the all-powerful
queen of the gods.
But wherever
there was evil,
wherever an innocent
would suffer,
there would be... Hercules.
-
-
Hail!
Whoa! Evanthea.
You know,
I walked all the way
from Kiriakos to spend
some quality time with you.
I never wanna
see you again.
Ever!
- Uh!
- Get it?
I get it!
Is it something
in the water?
Zeus only knows.
Get out and stay out,
you pathetic imitation of a man!
Are you all right?
dddd
I recognize that laughter.
Aphrodite.
Aphrodite? Come on.
I know you're here somewhere!
-
- Hah!
Look at these mortals! Losers!
Isn't this awesome?
That Evanthea
throws a mean right, huh?
What do you think?
Me-- Goddess of Music.
dddd
Aphrodite, are you
responsible for all this?
Totally!
I maxed out on the love gig.
I'm shifting my career gear.
Time to find a new energy field,
alter my aura.
Music? Not.
Wait. Does this mean that
there's-- there's no more love
in the world?
Whoa, are you observant
or what? Ha-ha!
Put it this way:
Guys still want it,
but women couldn't care less.
Well--
Come back here, you weasel! I'm
gonna roll you into a pancake!
So how come it
only works on women?
Duh! If men felt the same way,
where would the fun be?
This rocks!
Aphrodite,
people depend on you!
Oh!
Don't you realize the--
the enormous implications
of what you've done?
This is gonna have
sad consequences,
tragic repercussions.
- Besides, I got a week off.
- Tell someone who cares,
sweet pea.
I hate that.
In a moment we'll go down
to the village below...
and politely invite Leandra
to come with us--
or drag her,
kicking and screaming.
What village?
That village.
-
- Hah!
Bummer, I missed.
- You almost killed me!
- Chill, curly.
Not you, the tree.
Okay, so I need
a little practice to become
the Goddess of the Hunt.
Aphrodite, you can't be Artemis.
People depend on you for--
Ahh! That was,
like, my curve.
Sweet cheeks,
call me irresponsible.
You're irresponsible.
Cool.
Aphrodite, you have
been meddling with
the forces of nature.
There's gonna be
no more love in the world
for generations to come.
There won't even be any
generations to come.
Super bummer,
but not my problem.
No, wait.
You're doing it all wrong.
First time I've ever had
a complaint about my technique.
I meant your archery.
Okay.
Now squeeze...
and release.
That rocks!
I got a personal trainer.
Right on.
Men and women
of Syllabus,
I come to you
from Hephaestus.
Give over Leandra.
You've already suffered
his curse once.
Don't defy him again.
You're not his messenger.
An older man came this morning!
That was my father,
you dumb fool!
He's dead 15 years now.
Impossible!
Is it?
It can't be true.
Look at your vineyards,
all withered and dry.
Your fields,
barren and empty.
He's right.
What's happening?
If I tell Hephaestus
you refused him a second time,
at sunset your village
disappears forever!
No. Wait.
- Leandra went to the stream,
looking for her son.
- Ahh!
Hunting sucks.
Shh.
I mean, what does
Artemis see in this?
Hours and hours
of looking for some
huge, ugly, hairy pig.
Boar. Shh.
I'm hot, I'm sticky--
Ah! And what's this
I just stepped in?
- Over there.
-
That's a boar.
Okay. Go for it.
Get your hands off me!
Please! I can't leave
until I find my son!
Marrying Hephaestus
is more important
than finding your brat.
- Wait! He's only three!
- Leave her alone.
Don't interfere with things
you know nothing about!
You stupidly
risk your life!
So call me stupid.
Ahh!
Hey! You're next, pal.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
It was nothing.
Just-Just don't hit me,
all right?
Why would I hit you
when you just saved me
from being kidnapped?
You mean, you don't feel like
beating me senseless, or--
No.
Come. We'd better
get back to my home.
There are bandits out here,
or the She-demon might
turn you into stone.
Well, you have no fear on
that score. Hercules helped me
defeat the She-demon,
oh, a couple of years ago.
Who's Hercules?
You mean, you've never heard
of Hercules?
Friend of Iolaus?
No. Please.
Let's go quickly.
Perhaps by now my son has
returned to the village.
What village?
Oh, oh!
- Oh, mighty Hephaestus!
- What's this?
Where is Leandra?
Forgive me, Lord.
- I have failed you.
-
Get up, Iagos. I understand.
-She has no wish
to be my wife.
-Oh, she's willing.
But the villagers--
they mocked you.
They jeered at your name.
They called you
the great god "Hideous."
It's my destiny
to be alone.
No! She wants to marry you!
But as we were returning,
a dozen of the villagers
fell upon us.
-So they're keeping her from me?
-Her screams of protest
still ring in my ears.
Oh, please, Master, give me
the means to bring Leandra here,
where she wants to be.
Take this armor
that I'm making for Ares.
Do as he bids!
Syllabus? Not only have
I never seen this village,
I've never even heard of it.
You're not from
these parts then?
No, just the opposite.
My dad grew up around here.
Well, he must have heard of it.
Syllabus has been here
for centuries.
Hmm!
Leandra?
Hmm. That was weird.
Um, what's with all these
old-fashioned clothes anyway?
What do you mean, old-fashioned?
Ah, no. They're-They're nice.
Iolaus,
I can't thank you enough.
The least I can do
is offer you supper,
after I locate my son
and give him
a piece of my mind.
He's the one!
Stranger, you brought
Leandra back?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
That was me.
She was being attacked by
a bunch of guys, so I kinda--
I'd have nailed 'em all
if Hercules had been with me.
Who's Hercules?
"Who's Hercules?"
Wait a minute. You mean,
you never heard of him either?
Where have
you people been?
Uh, you know,
I-I-I'd love to stay and chat,
but, um, I got a dinner date,
so-- Ooh, ooh!
Because of your foolish actions,
we'll be cursed
by Hephaestus again!
Stone him!
Yes, stone him!
-  Stone him!
- Oh, boy! Ow!
Kill him!
You people really know how to
roll out the welcome wagon! Ow!
Huh! Huh!
Friendly little town
you got here!
It used to be.
Hey, tell me, uh,
what is all this
about a curse and,
uh, Hephaestus?
My advice?
Forget about it and leave.
I intend to.
Thanks. Great.
Ask a simple question--
Hephaestus. Ha-ha!
I haven't seen the Hephster
since we were teenagers.
- Class voted him worst dresser.
- Aphrodite.
Hmm.
It's an image thing.
Like right now, I just scream,
"intelligence," right?
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.
- So now you're covering
Athena's territory, huh?
- Nah, I tried.
This stuff gets old real fast.
They should, like, put pictures
in those things or something.
Hey, well, here's an idea.
Be the Goddess of Love.
No heavy reading. Aphrodite,
there's something strange
going on here in Syllabus,
and no one will
tell me what it is.
Syllabus?
Syllabus! Of course!
Apollo told me all about it.
Hephy zapped 'em
with a curse.
And?
Who remembers details?
At the time, Apollo and I
were rolling around
in the back of his chariot.
Ugh!
Judging by their clothes,
I'd say Hephy zapped 'em
with a fashion curse.
Thanks, Aphrodite.
That's cleared things up.
Uh, there's another thing.
Men and women here, they seem
to be getting along fine.
Why is that?
Do I look
like the Oracle at Delphi?
Boy, I wish
Hercules was here.
Hercules! Of course!
My brother's gig!
I could do that easily.
Action, adventure--
But first, the right outfit.
That's key.
What have I done?
You've angered Hephaestus.
So, laugh, eat, drink wine,
because this is
your last day on earth.
And then you disappear forever,
as if you never existed!
-
- Please!
If we find her, will Hephaestus
give us another chance?
He gives you until sunset!
Let's go!
Find your child yet?
No.
And that frightens me
more than anything
Hephaestus might do.
Leandra,
what's going on?
Iolaus, I warn you,
don't get involved.
I almost got stoned back there.
I am involved.
Hephaestus has chosen me
to be his wife.
Aren't you already married?
My husband was killed two
years ago in the Punic Wars.
Punic Wars?
My grandfather fought in those,
but that was over 50 years ago.
You must be mistaken.
Here she is!
Uh, one moment.
Huh! No!
Yaah!
Uh!
Iolaus! Find my son!
Leandra-- Uuh!
For the safety of all,
we're keeping you here
until sunset.
What about Leandra?
Never mind her.
We're saving you
from Hephaestus as well.
Oh, forget about me.
- What about her little boy?
- There's no sign anywhere
of young Skouros.
Skouros?
That was my father's name.
He was probably playing down
by the brook when the village
disappeared the first time.
Wait a minute. You mean,
the village disappeared?
For 50 years, and now Hephaestus
threatens us again.
This time forever.
Lucky little Skouros
probably escaped the curse.
When my father was
three years old, they found him
playing by the brook.
- He'd been abandoned.
- Well, if it was him,
at least he had a full life.
We may never have one.
Then... that means
Leandra is my--
Pretty Herculean, huh?
Uh, frankly,
Herc never looked so--
And, uh, he doesn't
carry weapons either.
But I love accessories,
and this matches.
A little help here.
Now smile and play
the happy bride-to-be,
or your village
disappears forever,
along with your son.
Leandra.
Welcome.
Thank you.
I told you how eager
she was to see you.
- You come freely?
- Yes.
She's not repulsed by me.
Well done, Iagos.
Claim your reward.
Oh-- Oh it's--
Only if you insist.
I-- Eh, perhaps this shield
you're making for Perseus.
When it's finished,
it's yours.
Iagos will show you
to your room.
This way, my lady.
When we get in there,
be alert.
Uh-huh?
Uh, keep moving. And, uh,
Hercules and I, we always cover
each other's backs, okay?
Do you rag Hercules
all the time too?
Look! There's the entrance!
Ooh, I can't wait to mix it up!
Aphrodite?
Uh-huh?
Before we go in, um,
I think I should teach you
a few moves, just to see
if you're ready.
Okay.
Right.
Okay, try and hit me.
Uh!
You're ready.
Next.
Listen, um, don't you think
it'd be a lot easier...
if you just made Hephaestus
fall in love with somebody else?
Eat sand!
Goddesses! Ooh!
Check out that statue.
Cool.
Uh, Aphrodite,
time to mix it up.
Um,
I'm not really
a cat person.
Later.
Not a cat person?
Thanks for covering my back,
Aphrodite!
Good teeth!
Which fork?
- Wrong fork.
-
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.
Come on!
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Oh!
Later.
Nice detail work.
Aphrodite.
Boy, is it hot in here.
But I guess if
you can't stand the heat,
stay out of the forge.
I haven't seen you
for centuries.
- You're even more beautiful
than I remember.
- Thanks, Heph.
You, um, haven't changed either.
Oh, now let's cut
the small talk.
Give up the grandmother, babe,
or else suffer my wrath.
Never.
She wants to stay with me.
Listen up. There's no
Goddess of Love anymore,
so you don't wanna
go one-on-one with me.
Don't I?
Aahh-yaahh!
Uhh! Uh! Ohh! Tsk!
You made me break
a bootstrap.
There should be, like,
hazard pay to this job
or something.
Listen, Heph,
don't make me
repeat myself.
Give her up, or else.
Or else what?
Bitchin'.
This goes very nicely with
my gauntlets, but you think
this thing can hold me?
Please.
Aah!
Zeus himself couldn't
get out of that chair.
Well, it's ideal
for entertaining,
but I'm not into bondage,
okay?
Release me.
Of course.
Once I wed Leandra.
So, you're kinky.
Who knew?
This isn't exactly drip-dry.
Can I borrow that cloth
over there?
No, not that one.
Wow, it's beautiful.
It's so... me.
Even an ugly god can dream.
Ahh!
- Iolaus!
- Yeah.
He wasn't much
of a guard. Come on.
I-I can't leave with you.
The fate of too many others
depends on me.
My son--
Leandra, I wish I didn't
have to tell you this,
but Hephaestus has already
punished Syllabus once.
What you think happened
only this morning
happened over 50 years ago.
That can't be.
Your boy escaped
the curse...
because he was playing
by the river.
I don't believe you.
Believe this.
Your son, Skouros,
he was--
He's my father.
That's impossible.
Here.
My father had this
hanging around his neck
when they found him.
He was three years old.
That's my husband's.
My son wears it
to play soldiers.
Little Skouros,
all grown up?
Yeah.
Please, take me
to him right away.
No. No, we haven't
got time for that.
We have to get going.
Let's get outta here.
Hephy! Um, I always knew
that you made weapons,
but when did you become
such a talented artist?
Don't flatter me.
I know what people think of me.
They think you're brilliant.
I mean, this throne is,
like, amazing.
How does it work exactly?
You know, you're kinda cute
from this angle.
You'll say anything
to gain your freedom.
I'll release you
after the vows.
But you don't really
love Leandra, do you?
A dozen villagers came in
through the tunnel
and took Leandra!
A dozen?
Like, major liar here.
- Trust me, there's only one.
- Why should I deceive you,
Master?
- I served you faithfully
all these years.
- Let me guess.
Because you have no life?
Because you hate your job?
Because you have
a real big yen for a lot of
really cool weapons in here?
This guy reeks of bad karma.
Can't you feel it?
Don't let her looks
twist you around.
Are you lying to me, Aphrodite?
There isn't anything I've said
to you that I didn't mean.
Is that so?
She thinks you're ugly,
Hephaestus.
Why don't you ask her?
Leandra loves you.
If only there was some way
to get her back.
Take them.
Go!
It's all right.
We can rest here for a while.
No, I wanna see my son.
Where does he live?
Is it far?
Will he even remember me?
Leandra,
your son-- my father--
he's dead.
No.
I'm sorry.
I should never have
let him out of my sight.
Some things
are meant to be.
It, uh--
It happened in battle.
He became a great warrior--
a general.
Like his father before him.
Sons take after
their fathers.
I'm sure you're
a reflection of him.
In a way.
You'd have been
very proud of him.
If only I could be
with him just once more.
That can be arranged.
Go, go! I'll come for you!
Ow! Ooh!
Kill him!
Iolaus! Help me!
Aah!
Shoulda got a bigger stick!
Getting that
ol' sinking feeling, huh?
Okay, you metalheads! Aah!
Incoming!
Now, that rocked.
Leandra.
Big mistake giving that
to the creepy cretin
with the awful aura.
Iagos is my friend.
A guy who calls
you "ugly" to your face?
Yeah, that's a real bud.
Besides, it's not true.
You can stop lying.
Hera, my own mother, threw me
out of Olympus because she
couldn't stand the sight of me.
Horse-face Hera? There are
no mirrors in her home,
and for one good reason.
Besides, beauty's not
just what you look like.
It's also what you are inside.
Whoa.
That's, like, profound.
Of all the Olympian gods,
only I am ugly.
If Zeus had been my father,
maybe my life
would be different.
But you have no idea
what it's like to be judged
on your appearance alone.
Oh, yes, I do.
We have that in common.
It's done.
This was intended for you.
You're free to leave.
Actually,
I'm not in any hurry.
Good-bye, Aphrodite.
That's a first.
Leandra! No!
-
- Leandra! Hold on!
Okay. You have to help.
That's it.
Come on.
You all right?
Yeah. I'm fine.
Thanks.
We're family, right?
So we are.
In one day, I lose a son
and gain a grandson.
To think, if Skouros hadn't
wandered off like that,
you wouldn't be alive.
Uh, yeah.
I-- I guess sometimes things
really do work out the way
they're supposed to.
What courage you have.
I'm so proud of you.
Thanks.
You think you can make it back
to Syllabus on your own?
Yes.
Are you going
after Iagos?
Somebody has to.
Please be careful.
Yeah.
Not happy with the decor?
Hey, I think this place smokes.
You're still here.
Yeah, I cleared
my afternoon schedule.
Tell me one thing:
Why Leandra?
A pale imitation, but...
she reminded me of you.
When Iagos returns with her,
I'll send her back
to the village.
Syllabus is free.
That's what you wanted
to hear from me, isn't it?
No.
What I want is
the answer to my question.
Do you love me?
For centuries.
Okay. This can be easy,
or it can be hard.
- You choose.
- I already have.
Yaah!
No, no. Not there.
Over here.
Very good! But how long
will your luck hold out?
A room full of weapons
fit for the gods,
and you choose a broom.
Yeah. Well, I don't wanna
kill you, Iagos.
Then you're unluckyandfoolish.
Not even worth my energy.
I'm leaving.
I lied.
Which side of the sword
am I on?
You're trying to remember if
I'm right-handed or left-handed.
- Aah!
-Uh!
That'd be left-handed.
Kill him now!
Here we go again.
What a waste.
You trapped my panther,
bested my shield...
and defeated
my armored warriors.
Guess I was on a roll.
Where's Aphrodite?
You brought her to me.
And for that,
I'll be forever grateful.
Me too.
Sorry I didn't cover your back
with those moves you showed me.
I was busy showing Hephy here...
some moves of my own.
Dite, please.
- "Dite"?
- The God of Fire.
It only takes one little spark
to start an awesome flame.
- So things are back to normal
between men and women, right?
- Totally.
I've decided to leave
the action business up to
my big brother Hercules.
That's a relief.
Well, I'm gonna go and say
good-bye to my grandmother.
Remember if you or Hercules
ever need any weapons--
Hercules doesn't do weapons.
Oh, sweet cheeks.
I already got a petition
from some babe in Parthea.
Evanthea. Huh!
- She wants to see me again.
- Go and make somebody happy.
Yeah.
Or don't you and Hercules
do that either?
