Are we spinning yet? All right, nice.
Chelios, how we doing, baby?
You never call me no more.
What is that? Where is the love, huh?
Now, how are you feeling?
I have to guess maybe
you're feeling like shit about now.
Now, you can't move too good, huh?
You can't breathe too good.
What the hell is the matter with you,
dude? Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What is this? Mm.
Oh, fuck. Can you guess what this is?
I bet you can't, Chelios.
Check this out.
Check this out.
Uh-huh.
Oh, I'm just plain sick, uh?
I must be the motherfucking genius
of sick, you know?
Poison Chev Chelios in his sleep, that'
like some Shakespeare or some shit.
Ooh! Damn,
you knocked this dude out pretty good.
About to get you a spot
on the Dodgers, son, yeah?
Maybe you don't understand
what just happened.
- I just fucking killed you.
-
You try not to embarrass yourself
because you're on Candid Camera.
This shit right here I gave you,
this is some hi-tech, sci-fi,
Chinese, ooh, synthetic bullshit.
I don't know exactly
what the fuck is in this shit, dude.
All I know is that once this shit
has binded with your blood cells,
you're fucked, baby,
and believe me, it' done binded.
You got yourself about an hour max.
Ticktock. This shit has been real.
You should have thought twice
before you whacked Don Kim.
Experiencing a little 20-20 hindsight,
ain't you?
Yeah, I thought so.
Now, you have yourself a nice death.
Asshole.
Light that up. Home run.

Hey, this is Eve.
I'm glad you called, but I'm not here.
Leave a message. Unless you're trying to
sell something, cos I'm not interested.
If you're not, then just...
Oh, time' up.
Get a cellphone, honey.
Please.
-
- Come on. Come on, come on, come on.
- Dr Miles' office. May I help you?
- Yeah, let me speak to him.
I'm sorry, but the doctor isn't in
right now. May I take a message?
- Well, where is he?
- I beg your pardon, sir?
- Where the fuck is he?
-  No. Yeah.
Uh-uh.
Oh, please don't. Ah!
I don't know, sir.
This is his answering service.
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Would you like me to have him paged?
Fine. Could you please let the doctor
know that Chev Chelios is a dead man
if he can't call me back
within the hour.
- Could you spell that for me?
- Yeah, d-e-a-d. Chelios.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- Hello.
- Kaylo. Where were you last night?
- What's up, Chev?
- I said where were you last night?
I, um...
- You wanna know what I was doing?
- What?
- Getting killed, you plum.
- What?
- You heard me. Ricky fucking Verona.
- Ricky Verona?
Who'd have thought that little bitch
would have the stones
to whack me in my own crib?
- It' inconceivable. Yet here we are.
- Where are we?
I'm dead and you're simple.
Now, you listen to me.
You put the word out
I'm looking for Ricky Verona.
- Anyone sees him, call me. Understand?
- I...
I'm gonna get that little fucker
if it's the last thing I do.
It may actually be the last thing I do.
You understand that?
- Ricky Verona.
- Copy me on that, Kaylo?
- Yeah.
- Find him!
- Hey, man.
- Get up.
What you doing? What the fuck
you doing? Where am I going?
Chevy! Man, what you doing?
Yo, Chevy, what the...
- Where's Verona?
- What are we talking about?
- Don't fuck with me!
- OK, man. Just calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down!
- Fuck, man.
- Orlando, are you all right?
- Hey! It's a white nigger with a gun.
So just... just be still, motherfuckers.
You see that? You see that?
I'm trying to help you here, man.
- I gotta find Ricky Verona.
- Why would I know where he is?
Yeah, yeah. Don't know where he is,
but you're gonna tell me where he is,
or I'm gonna blow your brains
into the fucking toilet!
- Put the cat right down!
- The white man is cool.
The white man is cool.
You're like them Somalian niggers.
Chevy came because he has something
he would like to discuss.
We're gonna discuss this shit
in a civilised manner.
Chevy, I believe you had a question
or some point you were trying to make.
- Where's Verona?
- I'm not affiliated with Ricky Verona.
You pulled the Anselmo job together.
Don't try to fucking!
-
-  Easy, easy.
Easy. All right? Look, clearly
you're operating under false pretences.
Ricky Verona and myself
did not pull the Anselmo job.
In fact, Ricky Verona
fucked me on the Anselmo job.
In fact, Ricky Verona
still owes me $7500.
- Not how I heard it.
- That's the way it is.
I don't know where Ricky Verona is,
cos if I knew where he was,
I'd probably be there right now
beating the Gucci off his ass.
All right.
All right.
That's what I'm talking about.
That's almost civilised.
Chev, dude, what's the matter with you?
Just get me some coke, OK?
You got any coke?
- So now you're just gonna insult me?
- Come on! I don't have time!
Just give me something.
- I'm really dying here.
- I can see that.
You don't understand.
I'm really fucking dying.
You saying this is medicinal-use coke?
That's right.
Well?
- What?
- The shit ain't free, nigger.
That's enough.
What, you gonna do the shit right here?
Chevy, come on, man.
Oh, God.
Chevy...
- Oh, what the?
- Oh, that's good. Oh, that's good.
That's good, right?
Why you looking for Verona
anyway, man?
Some Chinese assholes
hired him to kill me.
So this is about the Don Kim situation.
- What do you know about it?
- You pulled the trigger.
Course I pulled the trigger.
Why wouldn't I pull the fucking trigger?
Whoa. Yo, Chelios, you good?
- This shit ain't working.
- I beg your pardon?
I think I know what I have to do.
A man's gotta do
what a man has gotta do.
- What is it you gotta do?
- I gotta kick some black ass.
- What?
- Agh!
- Oh, shit!
- Asshole!
- Here he goes again.
- Who wants white meat?
- Doc?
- What' up, Doc?
- Fucking motherfucker.
- Why aren't you dead? What you doing?
Coming for you, asshole.
Fucking believe me.
Whatever. I'll be waiting for you.
You ain't gonna make it, though.
I'm all about hooking up with that
little Miss Chica you've been banging.
I know about that shit.
As soon as your ass is underground.
I forgot to say so on that gay
James Bond tape I left for you.
Yeah, yeah. What, and then
you're gonna rape my grandmother?
Blah, blah, fucking blah.
Now, listen to me, you little mug.
What do you think Carlito's gonna do
when he finds out what you did?
- Your whole crew is history.
- Driver, pull over.
- Fuck! Great.
-
Carlito? That's some fucking funny shit,
cos me and Carlito,
we're boys now, we're tight.
You haven't been tight since
your brother fucked you.
That's snappy. But I did you
pretty good, though. You could admit it.
- We'll see.
-  Pull over.
- You know what the best part is?
-
Sorry, must go. Bye-bye.
- Dr Miles.
- What took you so long?
Sorry, Chevy. I just got the message.
Forget it. Listen, I'm dying.
I've been poisoned with some kind
of Chinese synthetic shit.
- What?
- You've gotta fucking do something.
What are your symptoms?
I'm slowing down, caught in a tar pit.
- Blurred vision?
- Yeah.
- Dizzy?
- Sure.
- Any pain in your chest?
- Not really. I'm feeling pretty good.
- What are you doing?
- In a mall, cops chasing me.
The flow of adrenaline's
what's keeping you alive.
- I'm having trouble hearing you, Doc.
- You gotta keep moving, Chevy.
Explain.
If I'm right, they gave you the
Beijing Cocktail. It's very nasty shit.
Works on the adrenal gland,
blocks the receptors.
The only thing you can do is to keep
the flow of adrenaline constant.
- Meaning if you stop, you die.
- Hang on.
Jesus. What?
Are you there? Are you OK?
- What'd you say, Doc?
- If you stop, you die.
That's what I'm trying to do,
keep moving, keep the blood pumping.
Chev, are you there? Chevy?
Every time I slow down,
it's... like my brain starts to rust.
- Have you taken anything?
- Couple of grams of coke.
I'll be in LA in about an hour.
I'll call you as soon as I get there.
But do not stop moving.
Keep yourself pumped up.
Taxi! Yo, yo, yo, yo!
- Go.
- Where we go?
Just drive.
- Make a right.
- Where do you wanna go, man?
Right.
- Oh, shit.
- A right. Make a right.
Crank the music up.
Crank it!
# Don't tell my heart
My achy break heart
- # I just don't think he'd understand
-
# And if you tell my heart
My achy break heart
# It might blow up and kill this man
# Whoo-ooh!
Pull over, pull over.
Thanks, mate. Don't go anywhere.
I'll be back in one minute!
OK, cowboy.
Hiya, mate.
You move, you die.
Hey, this is Eve. I'm glad you called...
Fuck!
Where do you wanna go, man?
Beverly Hills.
- Chevy.
- Hey, boss.
Something urgent's come up.
So I've heard. Word travels fast.
Listen, Carlito, I need your help.
I don't have a lot of time.
No, not much.
You've gotta find an antidote
or something.
- What's the matter?
- The shit they gave you.
Chinese shit. There is no antidote.
- What, that's it?
- Honestly, you should be dead already.
It's a miracle.
- A miracle?
- We give that shit to horses.
You don't have to be
so damn fucking cool about it!
What do you expect me to do, hm?
You're gonna find that punk Verona
and his whole fucking crew
and feed them to a cage of wolverines.
What is this?
- What, are you boys now or something?
- Verona?
That's a small-time punk.
That's not to say
there isn't an opportunity.
Opportunity?
Everyone knows
the love I have for you, Chev.
Maybe this makes up for the Don Kim
heat which was perhaps ill-advised.
Ill-advised?
The heat from Hong Kong has been
much more than we anticipated.
That's outstanding, Carlito.
Glad to know that my death
can be of some fucking use to you.
- Don't be difficult.
- I'm not being difficult.
I don't know if you'd noticed, but I'm
having a difficult fucking day, brother!
Yah. I'm outta here.
Ah! You're not getting in my cab wet.
I gave you $200
to wait for three minutes.
You're not getting in my car! No way!
Yeah, you're right.
I'm not getting in your cab.
Al-Qaeda! Al-Qaeda!
I'm American! Get off me!
- Yeah.
- Hey, Chev. My flight's been delayed.
- Shit.
- No, no, it' all right. Relax.
Don't relax. Listen to me.
That shit they gave you
is cutting off your adrenaline.
Excitement, fear, danger, it causes
your body to manufacture ephedrine.
Huh?
- They've introduced an inhibitor.
- Fuck's sake!
Your only chance is to increase the
ephedrine to force out the inhibitors.
Get to the emergency room,
get some epinephrine.
It's an artificial adrenaline.
It comes in 10-milligram syringes.
It gets potent, so don't overdo it.
Probably a fifth of an injection'll do.
Chevy? Did you get that?
- Did you get that, Chevy?
- Epi-something, yeah.
- Nephrine, man.
- OK, OK, OK, I've got it.
- I'll call you when I get there.
-
- Yeah.
- Chev.
Yeah? What is it?
- Hello?
-
- Come on!
-
- Chev.
- Yes. Fuck.
I just saw Verona's brother
walk into the Prince.
- Interesting. The Prince.
- Yeah. I was getting a taco.
He just walked right in two minutes ago.
- Where are you now?
- Across the street. Where are you?
I'm there. Meet me on 7th.
One more.
Huh?
Is he in there now?
Did anyone go in with him?
Right, wait here.
Shit! Agh!
How'd you like that one, tough guy?
How freakin' awesome
was that, huh? Huh?
Well, well, well. Feel like talking
to me? Where's your fucking brother?
Doing your mother
like a fucking whore, you bitch.
Nice. Wonder how many steaks
I could carve out of you.
You're dying, motherfucker.
# I was born to run
I was born to dream
# The craziest boy you ever seen
# I gotta do it my way
# Or no way at all...
# I'm even on my knees
# Making love to whoever I please

You wanna dance with me,
motherfucker? Huh?
- I'm gonna fuck you up.
-
Come on.
# Tried to tie me down
# I was such a clown
Jesus. Nothing's easy.
Wanna hold hands?
Don't stop it. Here we go.
- Hey, talk to me, bro.
- Hey, Ricky. What about sucking me off?
You in the mood? Will you let me
lick your ass or something?
Who is this? Chelios?
Is this fucking Chelios?
That' right, bro.
I've got your brother' cellphone.
I can tell you have it all figured out.
Looks like you should have cut me up
when you had the chance.
I'm having a little trouble
hearing you, Ricky.
You experiencing
a little 20-20 hindsight?
You're supposed to be fucking dead!
I kind of like that shit you put in me.
You gonna give me some more?
- Oh, I'm... I'm gonna...
- Oh, I know, I know.
What's this?
A necklace.
You guys really are faggots, aren't you?
You motherfucker.
Fucking motherfucker!
My grandfather gave that medallion
to my father and then he... You fuck!
Fuck you, man. You take that thing
and you shove it up your ass.
No, thanks. You know,
I believe I'll hang onto it.
Looks like you'll have to
come find me after all.
Fucked up
that you killed your own brother.
You...
What was that shit? Epi?
Good work, Kaylo.
Puta.
-  Asshole.
- No need to push.
I'm looking for something
that starts with E.
- England?
- Very funny.
No. Some kind of artificial adrenaline.
- Artificial adrenaline?
- Yeah. I've got heart problems.
- Epinephrine.
- Yes. Epinephrine.
I love you. Epinephrine.
- I can't give you epinephrine.
- Why?
Just a minute.
Oi! What do you mean, you?
What is this shit?
- Nas-all spray.
- Fucking miserable bitch. What?
Nas-all spray. It's got epinephrine
in it and it'll get you tweaked, man.
Hey!
- That's the guy?
- Yes.
Man, come on.
This room's clear.
Could anyone speaking Korean
please come to ER?
Anyone speaking Korean
please come to ER.
Yo, yo, yo.
Yo!
You, stop!
Stop!
Hey!
I know you motherfuckers
have epinephrine.
- Clear the hallway!
- We're already prepped.
- I'm having a really bad day.
- Oh, shit!
Tell me you've got epinephrine
on this fucking cart.
- I said tell me you've got epinephrine!
- OK. I don't know.
Get back!
Don't you understand fucking English?
I understand English.
I just don't know which one...
Come on. Move!
I want some fucking epinephrine!
All right, all right.
I don't know where it is, man.
What is this, a rest home?
- What are you doing back there?
- Hurry up!
- I'm taking a shot.
- Get back!
- Well?
- I don't know if I have it.
- Give me a second here.
-  Put the weapon down!
Where's the fucking?!
- My heart!
- What?
- My heart!
- Yeah, yeah.
Drop your weapon now!
- What is this? This is a hospital!
- Shut up.
You, give me the epinephrine.
- Right there.
- Don't even think about it!
Uh, albuterol, Lortab. Um...
Epinephrine! Here it is! I've got it!
- Here you go.
- Give me that shit.
- Asshole.
- I'm not gonna tell you again.
All right? Just be quiet.
Juice me.
Juice?
- Do it.
- All right.
- Come on!
- OK, OK.
- I haven't got all day.
- Uh...
OK, I need both of them. Give it to me.
One, two.
Clear.
Get the fuck out!
How much of this stuff
did he say to take?
Chevy, we're in the air, man. Did you
get that stuff I told you to get?
Got it. Took it.
- You took the whole goddamn thing?
- Yep.
I said a fifth of a syringe.
That shit's gonna kill you.
- Your chest on fire?
- Check.
- But you're cold.
- Check.
- You got a steel hard-on, don't you?
- Let me check.
- Check.
- Stimulation of your blood vessels.
Your urinary sphincter is as tight as a
knot. You can't piss to save your life.
Urinary sphincter, check.
- Maybe Vicodin. You at the hospital?
- Negative.
- Could you get some grass?
- Check.
It'll be out of your system
in 30 minutes if it doesn't kill you.
This has cost me a fortune.
We'll be in LA in 20 minutes.
- I'll call you when we land.
- Copy.
Hey, Chevy, you're a good dude.
Been nice knowing you.
Copy. Out.
It's a medical emergency.
Police have declined to release the name
of the Los Angeles man still at large
on a citywide rampage that has left
one man dead, dozens injured
and hundreds of thousands of dollars
of property damaged in its bloody wake.
However, KTLA News has learned
the suspect is a professional killer,
with ties to organised crime
and an extensive police record.
He is considered armed
and highly dangerous.
We wanna get you back to
our regular programming,
but keep it tuned to KTLA for coverage
of this bizarre story as it unfolds.
What you're saying is that next
to olives, onions, lemons and limes...
Shit. Take it easy, mister.
- Get back, pig!
- Just... Just give me the...
Come on, then. Let's see you run, piggy.
Come on, piggy.
- Give me the gun back. Just...
- Yeah, you want it? There.
# Everybody' talkin' at me
# I don't hear a word they're saying
# Only the echoes of my mind
# People stopping staring
# I can't see their faces
# Only the shadows of their eyes
# Oh, oh, oh
# Oh, oh, oh
# Oh
# I won't let you leave
Honey, let's go. Come on.
Be careful.
All right,
I'll get some help, all right?
- Yeah?
- Hey. Did you try to call?
- Been home all day?
- I was sleeping in.
You were sleeping in?
That's great, Eve. Super great.
- Mm-hm.
- You all rested now?
- Mm-hm.
- Glad to hear it.
Listen, uh, I've been fatally poisoned.
There's probably a psychopath
heading over to kill you as we speak.
Don't get out of bed.
I'll be there in a flash.
Maybe you can fry me up
a waffle or something, OK?
Sure, yeah. Come on over. I'll be here.
Right, you'll be there. OK.
Bye.
So let's go get the bitch.
-
- Come on. Please.
All right, all right. Jesus.
Oh, my God.
Is this your new look or something?
- Yeah. You into it?
- It's gross.
Are you looking for my other boyfriend?
Yes.
You haven't turned on the TV today?
- No. Why?
- Didn't think so. We're leaving.
- What? Don't be such a freak.
- Honey, get dressed.
Actually, I'm glad you're here. Can you
change the clock on my microwave?
- I never changed it back.
- What?
The microwave.
Can you change the clock?
The daylight savings time,
I never changed it back.
- The microwave?
- Yes.
Hey, listen, I bought you some flowers.
They got fucked up on the way over.
That is sweet.
You OK? You look like
you're on drugs or something.
Listen, you love me, yeah?
Yes.
I need you to do something for me.
What? What's wrong?
I need you to put some clothes on,
sweetheart, and come with me right now.
- Yeah?
- No.
I'll change the clock
on the microwave. Yeah?
All right.
- The shit's wearing off.
- Oh, darn. I forgot.
The waffle iron's on
if you wanna make one.
Great. Great.
Agh!
Agh!
You're so stressed out.
Do you want some pot or something?
Yeah! No!
Ready! What's the matter?
- I burned my hand.
- Oh, my God.
- Let's go, Eve. Don't worry about it.
- I wanna see.
- Hey!
-
What the?
I'm sorry.
- That was completely uncalled for.
- Can we just?
Fine.
- I parked out the back.
- Oh.
- Darn. That... thing.
- What thing?
The waffle thing. I gotta turn it off.
Hello.
Hello.
All right. Very funny.
God, I hate that.
- Whoo!
- Trying to burn the building down?
- Oh! My keys.
- Oh, sorry, honey.
Nice one.
I swear to God, Chev.
I don't know where you are these days,
but it's not working for you.
Ah, my hand cream.
That's where you were.
Chev, can I have some help here?
Where is your car?
My car? Actually, I took a cab.
A c?
- This isn't gonna be...
-
This isn't gonna be easy, as they say.
Oh, fuck. All right. Here it is.
Sorry.
You know I told you I was a video game
programmer? Well, that was a lie.
Actually, uh...
I kill people.
Professional hit man. Freelance for
a major West Coast crime syndicate.
Last night was a job like
a hundred others, nothing special.
The Triads from Hong Kong had been
moving in on the local drug cartels.
My target was the number one man
in Los Angeles, Don Kim.
Well? What are you waiting for?
Then this insane idea comes in
through the back of my head
like a.45 slug at close range.
Congratulations.
- Did I win something?
- Your life, jackass.
They want you dead,
so sooner or later it's gonna happen,
but I'm not doing it.
I see.
Instead you're gonna do something
for me. Get out of town, disappear.
I don't care where you go,
I don't care what you do,
so long as you're invisible
for 48 hours.
That's all I ask.
Or if you prefer,
we'll do it the other way,
the way where I go to work
and you meet Buddha.
See, I... I quit.
I quit the business for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
I figured I'd tell you everything.
If you understand, we'd get on a plane
together, never come back.
Pretty crazy, huh?
You are so weird.
So are we going on a trip?
Well... I might be going on a trip,
but you're not coming with me.
- Eve, Eve, please!
- Mob hits, Chev?
Chinese poison? Do you know
how ridiculous you sound?
If you're gonna break up with me,
at least you can tell me the truth.
Chev? Chev?
What's the matter with you?
- Wait a minute. Do you trust me?
- No.
Make love to me.
- What?
- I think it'll help.
Help what? Are you kidding? Get off me.
- Take your clothes off.
- No!
Get off me! No!
- You wanna be more spontaneous.
- You're insane!
You're like an adrenaline junkie
with no soul.
- Save me, Eve. Save my life.
- Stop it!
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God. Are you OK? Are you OK?
Oh.
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. No.
No! No!
Get off!
Get off!
You filthy animal.
Take me right now in front of everyone.
That's it. Ugh. Ah!
Come on. Do it!
What are you waiting for?
- Jesus Christ.
- Come on!
I'm trying. Shush, Eve.
- Oh, God. Now you can't get it up?
- Shush, shush.
Come on. Come on! Get it up!
I'll fucking get it up! Jesus!
- Goddamn it, Chev.
- Shut up! Fuck!
I'm alive! I'm alive!
Verona, you motherfucker!
All right! Yes!
Wow! Oh!
-
- Oh, my God!
Oh! Yes! Chev!
- Yeah.
- What are you doing? Huh?
- Yeah.
- I've got Verona.
- Kaylo?
- I've got Verona, man.
- What?
- No shit? Where are you?
- Don Kim' shirt factory. I'm upstairs.
- What's the matter with you?
- Fifth and Alameda?
- Who's at Fifth and Alameda?
You don't let that motherfucker
out of your sight. You hear me?
- I'll be there in ten minutes. Got it?
- Yeah, Chev.
Out.
Honey, I gotta go.
I'll call you!
Oh, God. What are you looking at?
Hey, man. What's the matter with you?
You a crackhead?
No, no. Just step on it, all right?
You're not gonna die in my cab,
crackhead. I got something for you.
You take this Haitian shit, crackhead.
This is some hardcore shit.
It's made from plant shit.
Hey, what are you laughing at?
Look at this. You see that?
That's what a man look like, crackhead.
That's power. Now look at you.
What the...
Yeah?
Tastes like ass.
Well, that's right, devil. You wait.
-
- Shut the fuck up!
Say goodbye.
- No!
- Get the fuck open!
No!
Oop, there it is.
Fuck him.
We're here.
- What'd you say was in this stuff?
- I told you, it's hardcore.
That'll be 5.35.
So are you, man.
Have a nice day, devil.
This is fucked.
Where's he going?
Yeah, OK.
How the fuck you gonna call me
talking shit? I don't know where he at.
I ain't baby-sitting the motherfucker.
Fucking call me talking shit. Shit.
I'm doing my job. I'm doing my shit.
I'm out here just chilling,
doing what I do, on the rooftop...
Whoa, Chevy, Chevy. What's up, dog?
Everything all right? You chilling?
- What a fucking coincidence.
- What you talking about?
- You waiting for a bus?
- I thought a helicopter'd pick me up.
- What the fuck is this?
- What?
- You working for the Chinese?
- Chinese?
You crazy? I wouldn't do that to you.
- I am crazy. Where's Kaylo?
- Uh...
- OK, ding. Time's up.
- What d'you mean, ding?
What d'you mean, ding? Ah!
Where is that motherfucker?
Chev.
- What the fuck is this?
- Chev, baby. Take it easy.
You mean like this?
Now you tell me where that
little toerag motherfucker is. Verona.
Verona's got nothing to do with this.
What?
Don Carlos wants you off the streets.
- Carlito?
- You've totally lost your shit, dog.
You're all over TV, destroying property,
making unauthorised hits.
You're causing the organisation
a great deal of embarrassment.
You're telling me Carlito wanted this?
Don't worry about Verona.
We'll take care of him.
The best thing for you to do
is find some nice, dark, quiet place
and... just die.
Just die. What, do you think
I've got "cunt" written on my forehead?
- Maybe you're right.
- We all gotta die sometime, right?
Yeah.
We all gotta die sometime.
So I'll just die.
What the?
Oh, my fucking arm!
You miserable motherfucker!
- Oh!
- Jesus! Eve, move!
- Asshole. What d'you want?
- Don't talk to him like that!
My boyfriend kills people.
Nice.
I had to see
if you were telling the truth.
Come on.
No, wait!
Now come on.
Oh, God! Ooh!
Oh, damn it.
I forgot to take my birth-control pills.
- What?
- Yeah.
- Where are the keys?
- Chev.
- Eve, the keys.
- Here. Ow.
-  Come on, come on.
- My stuff!
All my stuff!
- You weren't lying.
- Welcome to my life.
No. I mean,
that you would give it all up for me.
Yeah.
- And the other part?
- The poison? Yeah, that's true too.
Then that means...
Pretty much.
- How can we stop it?
- Adrenaline slows it down.
- So when were in Chinatown?
- Yeah, sorry.
- Eve, what are you doing?
- This'll get you going.
- What?
- Come on. Finish what you started.
Oh, boy.
Oh, that's it.
That's really working for me.
- You like that?
- Stay down!
Motherfucker!
Oh! Jesus! Oh, yeah, that's it, baby!
Just a little more.
Stay down, Eve.
- Ah, Jesus.
- Oh, you're so big.
Oh, my God.
Just a touch...
What's the matter?
So you can fall asleep
like you always do? I don't think so.
Jesus fuck!
Are they really?
They're dead.
How can you do that?
- I told you, baby. I quit.
-
Yeah.
Chev, I've been trying
to get hold of you for half an hour.
- Where the fuck have you been?
- In my office. Can you make it here?
Sure. Why not?
Chocolate, what's this fucking receipt
from Gold Food's Market for $254?
Snacks.
I owe you again, Doc.
Chevy, you're my best customer.
- What is this stuff?
- Synthetic ephedrine.
Delivered with some saline.
Feels sort of good.
I got a little meth in there too, so
that's the endorphins you're feeling.
Wait a minute. What, so I'm not better?
Fuck, no, you're not better.
You're in such shit shape it's stunning.
I can't believe your heart's beating.
Should be in a fucking medical journal.
So what are you gonna do?
This solution is acting
as a competing inhibitor.
It's pushing the poison
out of your receptors
and replacing it with a chemical.
- But this is a temporary fix.
- Then what?
You're fucked.
Uh, I can put you on life support, Chev,
and string this out for a few days.
But you're gonna go into a coma
at some point and...
Does she know?
Why don't you let me load you up
and you can go out in a beautiful dream?
Dream.
Can I do that for you?
No, no, no.
That's not what I want.
What do you want?
One hour.
I want one hour.
I don't fucking believe it.
So the wild rampage that began at 9am
in West Los Angeles continues,
the mysterious suspect still at large.
Maybe we should have given him
more of that Chinese shit.
Oh, you think?
Dude, it's him.
-
- Turn this thing off.
- What's up, corpse?
- Bonjour, douchebag.
Thought you might be interested
in a little deal.
- You a dealer? That what you are now?
- Don't you worry about what I am.
Listen, I want the antidote.
Oh. Oh, the antidote.
- That' right. The antidote.
- What are you prepared to give me?
The jewellery I got off that faggot
brother of yours, fucking cocksucker?
- Hm.
- Don't pop a blood vessel, you penis.
- All right.
- You like that deal, do you?
- Whatever.
- I'll be at the Lint in 20 minutes.
- You know the spot?
- I know it.
Don't be late, or I'll trade this thing
to some whore for a fucking hand job.
Look, I said I'll fucking be!
If you don't fucking be there!
- See you later, sunshine.
- Turn that shit off!
Goddamn it. Fuck.
Yo, it's Verona. You're not gonna
believe this call I just got.
-  lt' gonna be all right, baby.
-  But you said...
I know. Things have changed.
There' an antidote.
Gonna make a deal for it,
but I've gotta go alone.
-  I'm scared.
- Of course.
You'll be safe now,
and I'll be back.
Promise?
I promise.
What's happening, bro?
-  Where did I go wrong?
- Did you fucking just say something?
It's like talking to the wall.
Mum?
I'm amazed you remember
you have a mother.
Mum, please,
I haven't got time for this.
-  You got no time, period.
- Orlando?
You're a persistent motherfucker,
Chev Chelios.
- They pop you and you keep getting up.
- I'm the Terminator.
You was, maybe,
but there's a new gun in town.
I don't get it. Why didn't you just cut
me up alive when you had the chance?
Too easy, motherfucker. Look at you.
Bipolar, sadomasochistic tendencies.
Adrenaline junkie.
Addicted to violence.
Carving up a guy like that while he
screams in his own blood and excrement
would be like a gift, a warrior's death.
Hell, you'd probably get off on it.
What the hell are you, anyway?
- I think I'm starting to figure it out.
- Well, better late than never.
- You know you're gonna die up there?
- Yeah, maybe.
But I'm taking you with me.
Some pills, Doc.
- Chelios.
- Hello, girls.
Hold up.
Give me the piece.
Now, isn't that a fucking picture?
Chelios.
What a fucking nightmare you are.
- No shit.
- Why don't you sit down?
Wait a minute. You pat him down again.
I know he's carrying something.
Let me see that.
- Fuck.
- It's clever. Is this an insulin pump?
- Basically.
- What the fuck is insulin, man?
- Ephedrine, right?
- Yeah.
Very resourceful.
- Found a new master, little bitch?
- I'm nobody's little bitch.
We'll see what kind of a bitch you are
when Carlito hires you and you take it.
That's enough.
You'll throw him a reach-around to show
him what a good little bitch you are.
I'm nobody's little bitch!
You fucking hear me?
And he'll pay me when I tell him to pay.
I said that's enough! Now sit down!
It's been a long fucking day.
But in the end, you have to admit,
it all works out quite nicely.
Don Kim gets his bullet, thanks to you,
and Hong Kong
gets a goat to take the fall.
Please understand, Chev,
it's truly nothing personal.
You speak for yourself.
That what I think it is?
It's the Chinese shit.
Hold him down.
Not so fast, motherfucker.
What does this guy think he's doing?
Whatever, psycho.
I'm afraid the Houdini act
is over, my friend.
Boosh.
- Our Father, who art in heaven...
- Shut up.
So this is how it is.
It's Don Kim. He's supposed to be dead.
Presto.
Go, go, go, go!
Police have moved to surround
the downtown Hotel Lint,
where the madman
behind today's mayhem
is believed to be holed up
and making a desperate last stand.
Officials have confirmed gunfire
on the sundeck.
Our news chopper will be bringing
live coverage from above the hotel.
This coverage is live and uncensored,
so if you have small children present,
you may wanna have them
leave the room.
Get me out of here now!
- I'll kill you for this, Chelios!
- Too late.
Look out!
Thanks, boss.
Get us outta here now! Let's go!
Present from Kaylo...
- Now what? Now you say shit!
- Where the fuck were you?
Who's the bitch now?
You fly, motherfucker!
Motherfucking fly!
You're dead!
Oh, my God.
You're dead! You're dead, motherfucker!
Told you I'd kill you, you little bitch!
Hey, this is Eve.
I'm glad you called, but I'm not here.
Leave a message. Unless you're trying to
sell something, cos I'm not interested.
If you're not, then just...
Oh, wait. Time' up.
-
- Hey, doll.
Looks like I let you down again.
Seems like all my life
I've just been going, going, going...
I wish I'd taken more time to stop
and smell the roses, so to speak.
But I guess it's too late for that now.
You're the greatest, baby.
# If only you believe
like I believe, baby
# Like I believe
# We'd get by
