Good God.

Matthew.
- Come on, shrimp. Hit me.
I'll give you a free shot.
-  Hit him again.

- Pathetic.
Come on, Dad.
Get up.

- Cohan.
Yeah?
- I beat him, you know.
- I know, Dad.
- T.K.O.
- That's right, Matty. You remember.
- Hey. Hey, what's that?
- Nothin'.
I told you I didn't
want you fightin'.
I tried to walk away like you said...
but they kept
givin' me shit.
Don't curse.
What kind of shit?
They said that you work for Fallon,
that you're one of his guys now.
Get over here. Sit down.
Come on.
You think I'd be pullin' double overtime
down at the docks...
if I was workin'
for Fallon?
What, are you nuts?
You don't hit nothin' but books.
Get me?
You be a doctor
or a lawyer.
Not like me.
Dad--
Matt... you can do it.
You can do anything
if you're not afraid.
Now you promise me.
Hey, kid! What are you trying
to get yourself killed?
I'm lookin' for my dad,
Jack Murdock. You seen him?
Murdock? Nah, he ain't
worked here in months.
- I will!
-Jack, come on. I got obligations.
- Dad?
!
Matt?
!
-
-
No!
I'm blind.
I know.
- How could you know?
- I heard you talking
in his office.
Something's happening to me,
Dad. I don't know what it is.
I'm sorry, Matty.
-
-
Whoo-hoo!

- The winner!
- What's up, freak?
Hooo-ooh!
- Kick his ass, man.
- Fight me. I dare ya.
- I dare ya.
Okay.
- I don't work for you no more, Fallon.
Jack, you never stopped.
Did you really think you won
those fights on your own?
They're all my fighters--
just like you.
Matty.
No! Come on, Dad!
Come on, Dad! Get up!
You can do it!

Dad!
I can't see you, Dad.
I can't see you.
dd
the sequence of events
leading up to the night ofJune 30?
I stopped off atJosie's Bar
after work.
I had a few drinks.
Angela was there.
for some fun.
Anything that happened after that
was entirely consensual.
- Are you aware that perjury is a crime,
Mr. Quesada?
My client is a respectable member
of the community, where Miss Sutton...
- has a history of drug and alcohol abuse...
- My client is not on trial.
- which not only makes
her testimony suspect--
- Nor is her testimony suspect.
- Gentlemen, that's enough.
Mr. Murdock,
is that Miss Sutton--
Mr. Quesada,
for your sake...
I hope justice
is found here today...
before justice finds you.
Man, we knew this was a risk
going in.
Why? She's from the Kitchen,
she's not from the Upper East Side?
Yeah. Come on, Matt.
She has a history of drug abuse.
- That was a long time ago.
-Juries don't like their victims flawed.
How can a scumbag like Quesada
afford an attorney like Hirsch?
He can't. The Kingpin's
gotta be footing the bill.
- Come on. Let's go get drunk.
- Not tonight.
I got work to do.
- d
Line 'em up,Josie,
I'm ready to party tonight.
You got a lot of nerve comin' in here
after what you did.
- Didn't you hear? I'm innocent, baby.
-
Bikes behind the cage!
No burn-outs,
you assholes!
- Whoo! Yeah!
d
Hey, hey, hey!
What's happenin'?
- Hey, Louie.
- What's up, goombah?
- Boss.
- What's up?
What's up with that?
Is that guy for real?
Yeah, he's for real.
-Justice.
d
-
-
Quesada!
Time to give the devil
his due.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
-
-
- Hi. How ya doin'?
Didn't you hear?
- I was acquitted.
- Not by me.
Who made you judge?
Wh-- You did.
-
-
- Go to hell...diablo.
Okay, but you'll
beat me there.
-
-
Guess what?
That's not heaven.
- I'll kill you!
- That's the ''C'' Train.
Oh, my God!
Hey. You can't
go past there.
- Call Charlie.
- Right.
You're wastin'
your time, Urich.
- There's nothin' to see here.
and the rest
ofJose Quesada.
Whole lotta nothin'.
Huh, Nick?
You keep runnin' those stories,
and we're gonna end up with
a bunch of copycat vigilantes...
who are gonna
get themselves killed.
Are you here to confirm that Daredevil
is responsible for this, Detective?
Come on, Urich.
Stop bustin' my--
There is no proof that your so-called
Daredevil was involved...
nor that
he even exists.
- Got it?
-
Got it.
-
Shh. Sleep now.
Listen to this. ''Eyewitnesses say that
Quesada was singled out...
by the demonic vigilante
known as the Daredevil.''
I don't know why
you read that trash.
- I've been hearin' stories for years.
Gotta be somethin' to it.
- Like alligators in the sewers?
There are alligators in the sewers.
I got a friend in Sanitation. He's seen them.
Fine.Just drop it.
You should see this guy.
They got this picture--
- They have a picture?
- It's, like, a drawing, an artist's rendering.
It's just--
It's grotesque.
I'd hate to see this guy's
therapy bills.
Speaking of bills, your client Mr. Lee,
he made his first payment.
- That's great. You should be very happy.
- Yeah, it's fantastic.
He paid in fluke.
Fluke is a fish, Matt.
Did you know that?
I sure as hell didn't.
Mr. Lee is a good man, and he...
doesn't have a lot of money...
and he goes fishing
on the weekends.
I go salsa dancing weekends, but I don't
shake my ass to pay my phone bill.
Pass the honey, please.
We need some better clients.
I'm tired of these pro bono cases.
What is your problem with our clients?
We have good, honorable clients.
Decent people. What's your idea of''better''?
Define ''better.''
- What would be a better client?
- ''Better'' means rich and guilty. Okay?
so you could represent people
who aren't all necessarily innocent?
That was your best course,
as I recall.
You don't have
a moral vacuum.
- You are completely vacuumless.
-
And what happened
to your face?
Nothing. A small cut.
I walked into a door.
Every time you disappear,
we can't get ahold of you,
you come in all cut up.
I'm in the fight club.
The first rule of fight club:
Don't talk about fight club.
- You're not in the fight club,
you're out of it.
- I didn't see the movie.
I'm sure it's a funny joke,
but I didn't see it.
Okay, all I'm sayin'
is I'm here for you as a friend.
I hate to bring it up again, but I spent
$3,000 on that Seeing Eye dog.
- I didn't ask you for the dog.
- Can I say something else?
Seeing Eye dogs bond for life--
yours ran away.
What does that tell you about
how emotionally available you are?
-
- What? What? Where? Where?
Front door.
Not yet. Soon.
Tell me.
- You want the truth?
She's hideous.
I don't know if it's a fungus...
or some sort of
congenital birth defect.
take no further action.
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- Sure.
Uh... I was just
looking for some honey.
- Right in front of you.
could you be a little bit
more specific?
- What are you--
- Blind? Yeah.
- I am so sorry.
The, uh--
- Friend of yours?
- I've never seen him before.
Matt Murdock.
Nice to meet you,
Matt Murdock.
Nice to meet you.
Uh--
I didn't get your name.
I didn't give it.
Apparently not.
- Where you goin'?
- Gonna file an appeal.
We have to be in the courthouse
by noon.
- I'll be there.
- What do you want?
- I just wanted to get your name.
- I didn't want any trouble.
- Look...
I don't like being followed,
so don't.
Uh, wait a minute.
Wait a second.
Take it easy.
And I don't like
being touched.
Why don't you tell me what you do like,
and we'll start there.
Sure you're blind?
Sure you don't wanna
tell me your name?
- You're holding back.
- Yes.
Don't.
Does every guy have to go through
all this to find out your name?
Try asking for my number.
!
Stop hitting me.
- Okay.
-
My name's
Elektra Natchios.
Thanks. That's all
I wanted to know.
I have to go.
Go? Wait a second.
Hold on.
D-Don't-- I don't wanna
get my ass kicked again...
I just want to know
why you have to go.
My bodyguard is here.
Your bodyguard?
I thought I lost him
at the coffee shop.
Dad can be a little
overprotective.
Oh, ''Natchios.'' Right,
as in ''Nikolas Natchios.''
- That's Dad.
-
How am I going
to find you?
You won't.
I'll find you.
Shit!
- What's wrong, Wesley?
- Have you seen the papers today?
Somebody's
been talking.
Somebody always does.
Wesley, did you know,
back in ancient times...
they would cut the tongues
out of their bodyguards
their first day on the job?
You think that's horrible,
don't you?
I do.
Whoo!
Wesley, handkerchief.
Your 1 1 :00 is here.
Natchios,
my dear old friend.
I'm getting out, Wilson.
Uh-- I am out.
-
- You think it's funny?
Oh, I'm tired of looking
over my shoulder.
I wanna put all that behind me.
I want you to buy me out.
I think you'll find this
a very generous offer.
So, what do you say?
How's your daughter?
Details.
You owe me that.
Her name's
Elektra Natchios.
She sounds like
a Mexican appetizer.
It's Greek, genius.
Her father's Nikolas Natchios.
- The billionaire?
- Yeah. See? Yes, the billionaire.
Then as your attorney in this matter,
I advise you to marry the woman immediately.
I'll take it
under consideration.
- What do we got?
- Oh, this one's a real winner.
DaunteJackson,
ex-con from Queens...
charged with the August 9th
murder of Lisa Tazio--
your friendly neighborhood
prostitute.
The bad news is Jackson
was found passed-out in an alley...
holding the murder weapon...
and enough THC in his lungs
to get Staten Island high.
Jackson says he can't remember
what happened on the night of the murder...
or, for that matter,
most of the '90s.
- What's the good news?
- The fluke wasn't bad. Could you let us in?
Mr.Jackson.
Who are you?
We're your attorneys.
So, are you...
innocent?
- Yeah.
I believe you.
Y-You do?
- You do?
- You got yourself a defense.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
I want you to create
a paper trail...
one that can be
traced to Natchios.
- Sir?
- The press want a kingpin,
so I'll give 'em a kingpin.
Get me Bullseye.
Two out of three.
Bloody Irish piece of trash.
What do you thinkJackson's
gonna pay us with? Chronic?
- Foggy.
- Hey, the guy's a three-time loser.
They found him a block away
with the murder weapon.
Which makes the fact
that he's innocent interesting.
How can you be
so sure?
- Have I ever been wrong?
- No. Which is really starting to annoy me.
Hey! Come on,
I got a blind guy here!
- Use the crosswalk, asshole.
- I love this city.
Empty your pockets.
Raise your arms.
All right.
This is it.
- Okay, now what?
- Take a look around.
I know you have a built-in
bullshit detector...
but this time
it's on the blink.
- Let's sayJackson is innocent...
- He is innocent.
then why go through the trouble
to set him up?
Why the big cover-up
in the death of a prostitute?
I don't know.
I can't answer that.
I gotta find out more
about Lisa Tazio.
Well, you know,
too bad we don't have a key.
Matt, Matt,
where are you going?
- Give me your pen.
- Right here. Leave a note?
- Here.
- That's my pen.
I must've been sick
the day they taught that.
Was that
real estate law?
- What do you see?
- What do I see? I see high ceilings...
-
What did she have
a puppy?
- Ammonia.
- So what?
Over blood.
Something else.
Cordite-- gunpowder.
She was shot here
and dragged outside...
to make it look
like a random robbery.
She wrote something here
in a ballpoint pen.
- ''M-O-M.''
- ''6-8.''
There. I knew it.
Her mother did it.
Now can we please go
before we need attorneys too?
What's the word for that?
Mulatto. Yeah.
Just let's say he had a little cream
in his coffee.
But he did very well for himsel
on the Internet...
but don't ask me how.
You know, they did get me
a computer for Christmas last year.
But I won't use it. I'm afraid
it's going to explode.
d
Oh. She's sleeping.
Oh. She's sleeping.
- Can I get you anything before we land?
- More peanuts, please.
where accused killer
DaunteJackson--
Ladies and Gentlemen
of the jury...
I am not here to convice you
that DaunteJackson is a model citizen.
This is a court of law.
Isn't he facing
the wrong way?
Don't worry, he's got them
right where he wants them.
- Yeah.
And that is what it's been like
for Mr.Jackson.
Like trying to talk
to a wall.
Does this defense come with
a two-drink minimum, Mr. Murdock?
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
I'm trying to make a point.
You see,justice is blind...
and, today, the truth will come out.
Thank you.
Here, r-r-right this way.
He's blind.
He can't see anything.
Okay, here's the, uh, the arm.
You got the arm there,
Matt?
Just reach down.
There you go.
-  I'm sorry.
Here we go.
You got it?
Okay.
- Was that too much?
- Yeah, it was a little much.
You always want to do the chair thing.
It's embarrassing.
- We want sympathy, it's not
- Okay.
Officer McKensie, you were
the arriving officer at the scene?
- That's correct.
- Please tell us what you observed.
I was a block away when I got the call
of shots being fired.
When I arrived on the scene,
Lisa Tazio's body...
was lying dead
on the steps of her apartment.
- What's wrong?
- McKensie's telling the truth.
Yeah, that happens
sometimes in court.
No, no, no, no.
Somebody has to be lying.
- What's he doing here?
- Who?
Post.
So does this mean you want a rematch?
I told you
I'd find you.
- How did you know I wasn't a mugger?
-
Muggers don't usually wear
rose oil or high heels...
at least this far
from Chelsea.
- There's something I wanna show you.
Exactly how many women
have you brought up here?
Uh... you're my first.
- Good answer.
- I thought that was the right answer.
I know. This was my favorite
view of the city when I was a kid.
