Tomorrow'syour day off.
Oh, well--
Look, I know that
Nicole's dad is a lawyer,

IfI only had that badge.
UncleJohn, it's not the badge,
it's the heart behind it.
I'm very proud ofyou.
Fingers crossed.
Fingers crossed.
This chip is gonna make
the whole Gadget project work.
-Dad, concentrate. Try to move the foot.
-
Allright. Kick theball.
Nothin'. I'm hungry.
Okay, all right. I'll go get us
some dinner. But then we keep going.
- Yeah.

the deliver guy again.
Hello, Antonio's ? Yeah, it's Brenda.

That's weird.
Wh-What wereyou thinking about ?
I was thinking about how much
you remind me ofyour mother.
Wait a second.
Wait a second !
That's it ! It's animated
bywill, not by thought.
Byyour heart, notyour head !

Well, good evening, young lady.
It's been a while.
- Four, three, two, one, zero.

-
- Go.
- Dr. Bradford.
- Yes ?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I borrowed a book from your dad.
- You did ?
- PowerLearning Through SpeedStudy.
- Oh.
It took me forever
to get through it.
But I really think
it's gonna pay off, though.
I just applied
to the Riverton police force.
- Yeah ?
- It's what I've always wanted to do.
- Help people, that is.
- Um, I gotta--
Dr. Bradford is out
ofthe lab and we can go in.
Sikes, release the remote-control van.
- Nice stars.
- Yeah ? Which ones ?
I just meant the whole--
- All of'em.
- Oh, I thoughtyou meant
a specific cluster.
I always take everything
so literally.
- So do I.
- Yeah ?
I forgot my keys.
- Oh.
-
- I'm-- Okay. Night.
- Sorry. Good night, now.
Well, I'll just stay here,
then, and, uh, secure the parking lot.

Hey, that guy's speeding.
Ten miles an hour

Oh, no, wait.
No, no, no, no !

Uh-oh ! Someone's gonna

Sniffy, let's go.
Dr. Bradford, I won't rest until
I fi nd whoever's responsible.
Justice will be served.
Brown, where areyougoing ?
- To catch the bad guys !
Stand back, Thelma !
- This isn't going to end well.

Oh, no. We're being chased

Hey, I have a hatchback.
Ooh. Oh !
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa !

Okay. No.
Not in his mouth, Brain. No. No.
Okay, stop.
We're lookin'atextensive

amajorconcussion,
all coupled with
extensive internal trauma.
This man tried
to save my father.
His risked his life

Clearthe way!

Dr. Bradford, both I and
Police ChiefQuimby here...
- Hi.
- are very sorry to hear
aboutyour father.
- He was a good man.
- Oh. D-Did you know him ?
No, I didn't.
So, how soon can you fi nish
the Gadget project, hmm ?
I'm sure that he would have wanted me
to fi nish it as soon as possible.
- Mmm. Oh.
- Yeah. With the, uh,
" English Patient" there ?
- That's enough, Quimby.
- Sorry. Just doesn't look like
you got off to a good start.
So, how can you be so
sure that this is the proper subject ?
Dad told me that I would know
when the right man came along.
John Brown's the right man.
- Well.
- Well.
That's good enough for me.
Let's go.
Hmm.
- Chain saw!
- Waxybuild-up, stat.
- Bring in thehoses, stat!
Keady, and... break!
It's a thing ofbeauty,
Quimby.
The future oflaw enforcement
reborn before ourvery eyes.
Yeah-- Columbo and Nintendo
all rolled into one.
He'll makeyou obsolete:
no overtime, no hazard pay,
no blue flu.
And he won't call me
" Evil Gidget" behind my back.
Oh, by the way, what do we have
on the Artemus Bradford murder ?
Well, we got a limo
with no license...
and some scrap metal from whatever
it was that broke into the lab.
- Do we at least know what was stolen ?
- According to Doctor Bradford,
- a robotic foot.
- Robotic foot.
- A robotic foot ?
- Yeah.
What kind ofcyberfreak
are we dealing with ?
Notbad, Kramer.
- Notbadatall.
-
It's got a sort ofpostmodern
Captain Hook kind offeel to it.
Very diabolical.
I deserve
a dashing appellation.
"DashingAppalachian"? Whatis that ?
A hillbilly with a tuxedo ?
- No, you idiot !
- No !
It's a nickname--
one that will send my enemies
cowering in fear.
Ah.
Ah, too bad
" Hook" is taken, huh ?
- How 'bout... "Captain Claw" ?
- Oh.
- No, no, no, no, no--
- Or "Santa Claw. "
Just "Claw."
One word,
like " Madonna."
Well, anyhoo, Captain--
Sir-- Mr. Claw,
I know how much you like
to maintain an active lifestyle,
so I have managed to design...
a few interchangeable options.
- Hi, hi.
- Oh, very clever, Kramer.
"Very clever, Kramer."
- Very clever, indeed.
-
Well, fi rst we have
the opera hand...
forthosespecialnights out.
And I know how much
you enjoyJapanese food,
so I madeyou a sushi hand--
see there ?
Tasty.
- Hmm.
-  Also,
I don't remember ifyou enjoy
the medieval fare, but--
Kramer, that's enough.
Sikes, bring on the foot.
-
- Oops.
Hmm ?
-
- What the--
What have they got me on ?
Ooh ! Ooh !
Oh, my-- Oh ! Ooh !
- I, um--
- Your thumb's on fi re !
- I seem to be having a reaction.
-
- Mr. Brown.
- Oh. Oh, it's you.
It's all right.
It's all right.
-  Um, I, uh--
-
I don't know what's wrong.
I, uh-- I seem to be ill,
and I can't remember anything.
You may not remembervery much
right now. You suffered a major
concussion in the explosion.
- What happened ?
- You'vejust come out of
a very long recovery.
You are now a sophisticated network
oftissue, hardware and software.
No ! I gotta get outta here.
Mr. Brown--
Mr. Brown, come back here.
We're gonna go in--
I'll take--
Look, Mr. Brown, I know
that this is all new foryou,
and it must feel strange.
-
- You will adjust.
- My head is very heavy.
- Don't worry. That's easy to fix.
I don't wanna be like this.
I don't understand
what happened to me.
John, we saved your life.
I'm not me anymore.
I'm a hardware store.
This is a huge opportunity.
You were designed...
as the fi rst prototype
cyber police officer for
the Riverton Police Department.
You said yourselfyou wanted
to help people-- this is your chance.
- I do want to help people.
- Iknow.
- Aiyee !
- Oh !
-
- I'llbe withyoueverystep
ofthe way.
Okay. I'd shakeyour hand
butyou might lose an eye.
Anandroidofthis quality
couldhave amyriadofuses.'
shock troops,
kamikaze pilots, hit men.
International rescue workers,
teachers.
Oh, yes. I was getting to them.
Well, let's see him in action, huh ?
Okay.
Oh, I'll strap myselfin.
Okay.
Turn me on, Kramer.
Move, darn you !
Move !
-
- It's a lemon.
Thankyou for that, Sikes.
- You put it on. Come on.
- Why can't he do it ?
He's capable ofintelligent thought.
That's useful tome.
Now, strapyou in.
Perhaps ifwe give him
maximum voltage.
-
- Yeah, that might work.
I wantmy...
mama !
Something got left behind.
What does Brenda have that I don't ?
This is thesingle
mostimportantcomponent.'
theneuronsynapseamplifier.
It's a high-powered
processor chip...
that increases the charge
in the human brain wave...
enough to move the machinery
that's now built intoyour body.
Without this chip-- themost
powerfulrobotics chip in the world--
your body couldn't
possibly function.
- Anymore questions ?
- Nope, I'm fi ne.
Guess itjust takes
a little getting used to, you know ?
Good. Then I will just giveyou
your manual to study.
Volume one.
Mm-hmm.
Looks like the usual stuff:
extendo-legs,
helicopter hat.
- Guess I'm all set then.
- Right. Oh !
There's onemore thing.
Ialmostforgot. It's important.
Your new wardrobe.
The Gadget suit.
Okay, so ifyou want to operate
one ofyour gadgets,
you simply say "Go, go, Gadget,"
and then you name the device.
Well, couldn't I say
something more official, like,
like, "In the name ofjustice."
Well, you could, but it wouldn't work.
But "Go, go, Gadget,"
sounds so--
My father designed
the program, and he--
Oh ! Oh-oh-oh-oh !
It's "Go, go, Gadget."
- I really like it.
- Okay. Good. I'm glad.
So, okay, let's say there are two guys
trying to rob ajewelry store,
and you wanted to trip 'em up--
what would you do ?
- Okay, uh, let me think.
-
Go, go, Gadget--
oil slick.
That's notoil,
it's toothpaste!
- Ooh ! Ooh !
-
Stop it !
- Whoa !
- Say, "Go, go, Gadget, stop" !
- Go, go, stop !
- We're gonna need
some more workwith you.
- Go, go, stop !
- We're gonna need
some more workwith you.
Try to visualizeyourgoal.
Concentrate.
Putall otherthings
outofyourhead...
except obtaining the balls.
Okay.
He'sjust like
the "Six Million Dollar Man."
-
-
- Wha-What ?
Ungrip !Ungrip ! Turn itoff!
Well, I guess
$6 million doesn't buywhat it used to.
-
- Excuse me.
He is not a man,
you know. He is a monster.
I've got something special
to showyou. Ta-da !
The Gadgetmobile.
- Wow.
- It's foryou.
Imade itmyself.
- Come on.
- You made me a car ?
The only thing anybody's
ever made me before is a sweater.
All right.
Now, it may look simple,
but this thing hasjust about
as many factory extras as you do.
Come on !
Get in there !
- Oh--
- Watch the coat. Okay.
Gosh, she's incredible.
- Oh, it's a he.
- Excuse me ?
You'll see. Okay, now, it has
voice activation, ejection seats,
a power-assisted metamorphic camouflage
system, a cardio-homing device.
- Then there's a periscope, a candy--
- Dr. Bradford,
there's something
I just have to askyou.
- Oh,just say, "Go, go, Gadgetmobile."
- Yes, but will you--
- "Go, go, Gadgetmobile" ?
- Good morning, Riverton !
Hey ! Who's in the car ?
I work alone.
Hey, before we hit the road,
I gotta tell you somethin'. Duck !
-
- I don't think the car likes me.
-
- I don't think the car likes me.
Whoyou callin' "car" ?
I'm a crime-fighting machine.
Watch this. Left turn !
- Haven'tyou fallen outyet ?
- No, sir, I haven't !
- Who areyou, rookie ?
- I'm OfficerJohn Brown,
and you're exceeding
the speed limit.
Speed limits are for cars,
not the Gadgetmobile.
- Areyou talking to me ?
- Speakin' ofthe law,
who's not wearing a seat belt ?
- Gotta wear the belt, baby !
- Hey !
It's a Disney movie. Now, I'm gonna
fight me some crime. Whoo !
More left turns !
Could you slow down, please ?
I-- I get carsick.
You know what makes me
peoplesick ? A rookie thinkin'
he's good enough for Dr. B.
Not that it's your business,
but what makes you think I was
putting moves on Dr. Bradford ?
Hey, I've got heat sensors.
I know whatyou were thinkin'
when Dr. B. gaveyou that smile.
Now, look here. Come clean with me, or
I'm gonna bounceyou right outta here.
I can assureyou my only interest
in Dr. Bradford is professional.
" Professional," huh ?
Well, good. Keep it that way,
andthat's an order.
- You got it ?
- Uh, I'm the inspector, you're the car.
I'll tell you whatyou are.
You're the--
Don't make me go
" De La Hoya" on you !
Isn't there an "off' button
or something ? A "mute" ?
- Oh !
- Sorry, sir !
Don't push my buttons without readin'
the manual ! Ooh, watch out there, now.
- Whoa !
-
- Hmm ?
- Aw, man. I got ajune bug
in my grille.
Shouldn't we be working
together, helping people ?
- Why didn'tyou say so ?
-
-
- Yo, Clouseau-- 9:00.
- Left, you idiot !
- Overthelock !
- Shut up and let me do it.
- Very observant, Gadgetmobile.
- Time to do some good.
-
- Lostyour keys, fellas ?
- Uh, keys-- Yeah, keys.
- Allow me to help.
- Say "bye-bye" to the rookie.
Here.
This ought to do it.
- Oh. Thanks.
- Yo ! Check out the bowling shirt !
Huh. I'm a bowler myself.
You work at the prison ?
- Uh, yeah. Work at the prison.
-
Psst! Gadget!
I'll be getting into the law
enforcement bowling league too.
- Thereyou are. Drive carefully.
- We'll seeyou.
That's it. I can't take it anymore.
Step away from the Viper !
- Hey, what's the big idea ?
- Open your eyes ! We got
a couple ofjailbreakers !
Well, then, we should inform
the prison guar-- Wait a minute !
Let's splitup. I'llgoafter 'em,
andyousay "ten-four. "

Go, go, Gadget-- coils !
Skates !

Oh, for cryin' out loud.
Go, go, forward, please !
Oh, for Pete's sake !

Why, it's that annoying little
security guard from the institute.

So he's the lucky duck they plucked for
the Gadget program. Ha ! Irony abounds.
That's my cruller!Gimme that!

Excuse me. Inspector,

Oh. Why, sure.
Yeah. You betcha.
Uh, here.
Let's see ifI still
know how to do this.
Not bad,John Brown.
May I cut in ?
Hello. Sanford Scolex.
We were at Harvard together.
- We were ?
- Oh, you don't recognize me.
That's because I've changed.
I was obese.
Maybeyou remember me better like this.
-  Yes !
-
Wow !
Well, it's nice

-
-
Well, I'll go get us
some champagne.
Oh, great idea ! Three flutes
ofbubbly, please, Mr. Gizmo.
We'll be right here.
You know, Brenda,
I'm not at all surprised
you've become such a renowned scientist.
You were always themost
brilliantonein school.
-
No, I was ahard worker.
- Oh, Iremember.
Iusedto watch the way
you wrinkledyourlittle nose,
concentrating on calculations.
- Youdid ?
- Mmm. You tookmybreath away.
- I... did.
- Brenda, dance with me.
- Youremindme ofa thing
Godzilla oncesaid.
-
Tell me, what will you do now that
the Gadget program is completed ?
- Ooh. Oh.
- Huh ?
You're done with the Gadget thing.
Come andjoin me at Scolex Industries.
-
-  We'll be right here.
Ahem.
I could only carry
two glasses.
Oh.
A bientot, ma cherie.
Ahh !
John, h-hejust
offered me ajob.
He said that I would have
unlimited funding,
my own lab...
and complete control
ofall my research.
But what about
your other research ?
The Gadget program-- areyou sure
you've worked out all the bugs ?
Well, um--
Oh, how touching.
The creator and the creation.
Excuse me, Inspector,
but the press would like to take some
photos ofus with our boys in blue.
Let's go.
Photo op. Okay. Come on.
-  Get ready, boys.
Here's the dynamic duo.
- The camera is your friend.
- Watch thebirdie !
- Getabigsmile !
Chief, ifyou don't mind
my asking,
when do I get started
on my big case ?
Oh, soon enough, Gadget.
I have a few assignments for
you to cutyour teeth on fi rst.
- Biggrin. That's it.
- Inspector!Overhere, please!
I've got to talk to the chief.
He's not taking meseriously.
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo, rookie.
Nobody likes a whiner. Now,
what areyou gonna do about it ?
I'm ready to get tough--
real tough.
- Here comes Gadget.
- Hey, thatyournewpartner, Gadget ?
- Whatyougot, a catburglar?
-A realfelon, huh ?
- The city's safe now.
- Catgotyour tongue ?
Inspector Gadget reporting,
sir, with the 1 3th--
that's a baker's dozen-- kitten
I've pulled out ofa tree this week.
-
- So ?
- Permission to speak freely, sir.
- No.
-
- Well, ifyou're gonna pout.
Thankyou, sir.
What I want to say is that,
while I appreciate cute and fluffy
as much as the next officer,
I fear that the kitten-rescue patrol
is a misuse ofmy capabilities.
Huh. You know, I don't get it,
Gadget. Every timeyou--
I won't be happy
until I've brought the murderers
ofArtemus Bradford tojustice.
Ah. And I won't be happy
until you're off the force,
andbeingsold, piecebypiece,
atsomegaragesale.
-
- I want that case, sir.
Well, I'll tell you,
the problem is the Bradford case
requires real police work,
- and the fact is, you're not
a real police inspector.
-
Youare notarealpoliceman.
Youarejustapublicitystunt
that we have toputup with.
So, why don'tyoujust
about-face...
and get out ofmy office.
Okie-dokles, sir.
I've pretty much completed Prometheus
peryour specifications,
and, I must say, the likeness
is really quite convincing.
Good. Imitation is the sincerest form
offlattery, Kramer.
Isn't that Dr. Brenda Bradford's
private data ?
Oh, yes.
I tapped into her fi les
and stole her research.
Whywould you do that ?
"Whywould you
do that ? Whywould you do that ?"
-
- Ah. Oh, oh.
Kramer, don't look
so nonplussed.
Now that Dr. Bradford is part of
the Scolex team, we share everything--
oratleast we will.
Oh, well, I think sharing fi les is a
great way to bring the company together.
You know, make sure we're all singing
off the same song sheet, so to speak.
Imaginemyrelief
tohaveyoursupport.
Anyway, sir, like I said,
without the chip, I don't think--
Oh, soyou made the chip.
- Hey, that looksjust like
the guywe almost killed.

Chips ahoy.

Oh, what about that ?
"Scolex Industries. "
Hello. Finally, there's

that that's an armrest, not a chew toy.
InspectorGadget
apparentlyhas goneberserk
in the downtown Kivertonarea.
Eyewitnesses told me
that he was laughing...
- while he maliciously stacked
these four cars.
- What's gone wrong ?
Other reports indicate that he's
already caused a major traffic accident,
destroyedprivatepropertyandsetfire
toan elderlyman's beard.
Go, go, Gadget--grappling hook.
Whoo !
-
-John !
What happened ?
I'll go get Scolex. Maybe he can help.
Brenda, it's not safe here.
Scolex is a liar and a thiefand--
Let'sjust say
he's not a very good guy.
Go home !
Lockyour doors !
Stay alive !
Whatever happens, I will fi nd you.
Oh, too far !
Whoa !

Wowser. Iknewit.
You'll pay for this, Scolex.

'Cause I am.

Greetings, Inspector.
Glad you could drop in.
- I oweyou one, Scolex.
- Oh ?
You blew up me and my Chevette,
and I really liked that car.
Well, you crushed my hand,
and I really liked that hand,
so, go, go--
get over it.
Idon'tknow whatyou're up to, Scolex,
butyou'llnevergetaway with it.
Oh, how cliche, Inspector.
I think somebody's been watching
too many Saturday morning cartoons.
- Hmm ?
- Huh ?
Huh ?
Unfortunately, Gadget,
in the real world,
evil quite often prevails.
I'm afraid so.
Pull him up.
Now, look howyour replacement
is helping people...
-to cross thestreet.
- Hey.
He looksjust like me.
I don't get it.
- Whywould you do this ?
- To make teachers !
- Shut up !
- Oh.
I'll tell you why.
To make technowarriors that
never get tired, never get hungry...
and never say "no."
Every army in the world
will be made up ofmy creations.
Imagine the confusion,
Gadget, huh ?
Imagine the perks.
Comprende ?
Yeah, I comprende.
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.
I comprendo.
Yo comprendo.
Conjugate the verb,
for pity's sake.
Pull the N.S.A. chip

You're kidding, right ?
Okay. Yousee ?He's always kidding.

I want to make sure nobody else
can develop their own android.
Doit, oryou'll

Okay, I am not here
right now.
I am on the beach with dolphins,
and, oh, hi, look at this starfish.
I don't feel so good.
I'm sorry, Gadget. Good help
is so hard to fi nd these days.
Would you mind
ifI do the honors ?
Well, here goes.
Arrivederci. Ciao, ciao.

Let's see whatyou can do,
Gadgetmobile, 'cause I feel

Et tu, Sikes ?
