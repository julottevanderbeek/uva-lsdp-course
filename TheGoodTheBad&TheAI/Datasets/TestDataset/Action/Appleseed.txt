"His tail swept a third of the stars out of
the sky and flung them to the earth.
The dragon stood in front of the woman
who was about to give birth
so that he might devour her child
the moment it was born." -- Revelation 12:4
Just as we anticipated
Hey, let me through
I hope the stun rounds didn't injure her
Captain, Deunan has been secured
She's beautiful...
The legendary soldier is so cute when she's sleeping
About your body, will you...?
She will be surprised
when we get to Utopia
Utopia, huh...
Olympus A5, do we have permission to land?
Don't get too close before ID is confirmed
or the Fortress cannon will fire
Olympus A5, come in
Permission confirmed
ESWAT109 preparing for descent
Briareos
I'm going out for a look
I'll go with ya
No, you stay here
Don't worry... I'll be back in a sec
Briareos
Gosh, a detailed inspection?
It was ordered by the Legislative Council
Still sleeping...?
Could we have given the wrong dosage?
Don't move or I'll break your neck!
Deunan Knute, 2nd Team Leader
You are ordered to stand down
Briareos
I can't believe it!
I know it's hard to believe
but it's the truth
So after all this war
nobody won in the end?
That's right
After the Great War, Earth became unified
and central administration "Olympus" took over
That means I blindly kept fighting for months
and it was all for nothing?
That's how war is, right?
But it's different here
Olympus is the realization of the perfect Utopia
Why did you bring me here?
Because you are an elite soldier
Your name was top on the ESWAT list
My mission is to bring people on the list
from the badlands to Olympus
ESWAT?
I know you must have lots of questions
but please take a rest tonight
We'll continue tomorrow
I'll show you around the city
I'm sure, Deunan, you'll fall in love
with our Utopia
Here is your bedroom
I bet you haven't slept on a soft bed for ages
I'll pick you up at 10 am tomorrow
You're Hitomi... right?
That's right
Have we met before?
I'm afraid not
Well, good night!
When did you...
In the battle of North Africa
I lost my body
It's been over one year
This was Carl's...
Your father left it for you
Don't let anyone take it
Call me if you have trouble
Briareos
Out there yesterday...
Do you know who attacked me?
No
What a pity...
Athena, you arranged that attack, didn't you?
You should know that mercenaries couldn't
possibly compete with the ESWAT
Have you forgotten the mission of Bioroids?
If the military found out
General Uranus would surely retaliate
We won't be able to control them by ourselves
Gaia may be reaching her limit
Athena, we don't have much time left
Nike
They've found out
My apologies, Ma'am
Nike
We need our man inside ESWAT
I'll make preparations right away
But the worst of it is
we didn't find what we were looking for
That means...
It's not time to use our last resort
But the fire has to be put out before it spreads
Secure Deunan Knute by whatever means!
Yes Ma'am!
Humans are such strange creatures
falling into their own traps
I never expected a personal visit from Captain Hades
ESWAT is still head over heels searching
for that dummy information
We have now completed 98% of preparations
Perfect
The problem with the special part on the leg
has also been fixed
General Uranus will be pleased
And soon...
The Bioroids will no longer be!
We should not be protecting wolves
Rather, we should protect the sheep
Indeed, that's the principle
of our 1st generation Bioroids
However, some humans are wolves in sheep-skin
No matter wolf or sheep
there should be no sacrifices
What a pity
We've always known the answer to this
Yet we still have to debate with Gaia
Then let us continue our debate with Gaia
Deunan!
Briareos!
Morning, Deunan!
It fits you well
C'mon
Your entry permit was approved this morning
So Deunan, you're now a citizen of Olympus
Beautiful, isn't it?
Compared to yesterday
this is like a dream
From today this is your reality
Everyone looks so happy
That's because 50% of the population
are Bioroids
Bioroids?
Artificially created humans
A clone?
No, not that simple...
Superior lifeforms created from
highly selective genetic breeding
Does that mean this city is controlled by clones?
You know, it's not polite to say "clone"
I'm a Bioroid myself
And despite being superior
Bioroids do not control humans
Bioroids coexist peacefully with humans
and stabilizes the human society
Half of them are Bioroids...?
This car feels weird
It's been installed with the Damysos System
Damysos?
Yes, it's like hovering
They say it can prolong the driver's life
So they've actually completed that technology?
But you still control with a steering wheel?
Because of advanced cybernetic technology
this car is driven by automation
But the wheel is "for the people"
"Functional simplicity, structural complexity
... make humans more human"
How's that?
What was that?
"People first." That's the basic philosophy
of the original architects
The city's landmarks are the Arcologies
There
Tartarus and Daedalus
They contain the I.N. that controls Olympus
central control, the "brain" of the city
I.N.?
"Intelligence Network" system
also called Gaia
Gaia grows with the network,
and monitors everything in Olympus
... especially us Bioroids
Why's that?
Well, humans have emotions
they argue
they fight
Bioroids have limited emotions
we do not hate
we're always in a state of equilibrium
so we'll never start a war
But at the top of Tartarus
is an impenetrable defense system
sealing "D-Tank" which stores a special virus
They say if the virus was ever released
all Bioroids would die
That's the result of human defensive instinct
It sure insults Bioroids though
You're suggesting humans are more dangerous?
That's why balance is so important
Gaia monitors the effect of Bioroids on humans
But it's actually humans who are being monitored
You sound just like General Uranus
Who's he?
Commander of the Olympus Military
an extremist who hates Bioroids
and who is quite vocal about it
Wow, an "unbalanced being" in Utopia
But for the most part
Bioroids run Olympus
Administrative Director Athena is a Bioroid too
Athena?
You know her?
I don't think so
The Administrative Director is like a President
However the military is controlled by humans
Scary, huh?
Recently, ESWAT under Athena has been expanding
Relations with the military has been bad
Now it's gone from bad to worse
But all decisions in Olympus
are controlled by Gaia
Something wrong?
We've got company
Hitomi, you OK?
Yes somehow
But what was that
They're pros obviously
Seems like I'm their target
So it seems
I guess THIS is still my reality
Briareos!
Hi grandpas! How is everyone?
Hitomi, did you get hurt?
Are you alright?
I'm OK!
Guess who I brought along?
It's Deunan Knute!
So here is the legendary beauty!
Goddess of Fighting
You have Carl's eyes
You know my father?
Not only that
most of the Bioroids in Olympus
have some of Carl's DNA
as his genetic material was used
for the 1st generation models
Which means Hitomi and Deunan are sisters
We heard you met some
um...
not-so-pleasant things
Recently, it's been increasingly complicated
to control the people outside
We worry that the balance will be broken
First, let us introduce you to Gaia
How are my pesky colleagues?
The Legislative and Administrative Councils
have begun confronting each other
on issues such as increasing Bioroid population
It's Carl's daughter that Athena wants, right?
Positive, sir
Everything has been prepared as ordered
What level is the informative source?
Level 5, sir
General
We await your orders
Human souls will no longer serve as tools
for their existence!
So this is Gaia
Gaia is a growing network
which controls Olympus
Gaia consults with the Seven Elders
and her decision becomes the will of Olympus
Gaia is the brainchild of many scientists
who had poured their spirits into its creation
However a machine is a machine
Built for absolute stability
A highly precise, reliable tool
With no emotions, no feelings
Absolutely impartial and takes no sides
Only by interacting
with the Seven Elder's feelings
could Gaia think more like a human
Though lately you seem to differ with Gaia a lot
Our work is to debate with Gaia
The conclusion of the argument
will then lead Olympus in the right direction
Deunan, when you were in the war
what did you fight for?
Well
Human beings will not stop fighting
as long as there are emotions and desires
That's why Olympus was created
The last hope for human beings
is the coexistence of humans and Bioroids
Gaia monitors the balance
Bioroids are totally different from humans
Without the ability to procreate
they can have no offspring
No sex, imagine!
So they do not have love
and with it, no desire
nor hate
However, if their life-extension process
is not carried out regularly
they will age very swiftly and die
We wanted Bioroids to be different from humans
so we suppressed their reproductive ability
shortened their life cycle
Hitomi
Aren't you late for your life-extension?
No problem, I'm going there in two days
We wish someday
there would be a less troublesome way for you
Kudo
Your team are all dead
Still Fresh, aren't you?
Better luck next time
Starting with only 1 knife
she killed 16 men in 10 minutes
Your rookie sure is something!
Did that feel good?
You shouldn't say things like that
They might have to save your life someday
Act like a smartass
and no one will take care of you
We haven't seen each other for so long
and that's all you can say?
Hey, can't you say something nice?
Like "how've you been?"
"nice to see you again"
Someone has an interest in you
I heard that already
But why would they?
Who are they anyway?
I don't know
And what's this "Appleseed"?
I don't know
Stop giving me such mechanical answers!
I'm sorry
Right now, my mission is to protect you
Mission...
Tomorrow we meet at 0900 hours
Well, if it ain't the legendary soldier
the great Deunan
They said you died during the Great War
Your exploits in the war of North Africa was legendary
May I sit here?
Go ahead
Deunan
Carl Knute, your father
Can you tell me about him?
He died before the Great War
Sorry
Your mother?
I can't remember anything about her
My father didn't tell me anything either
Deunan and Briareos were lovers, right?
Yeah, when he was human
though not sure about now
So the body is more important than love
That's not what I meant!
For a man, the body represents sex
By the way
How does it feel to be in love?
You know, Bioroid's emotions are restrained
I don't know what love is
I can learn and read about it
But
I can never feel it
So I become more curious
I envy humans at this point
A woman in love, what is that like?
The feeling of loving someone
You asshole!
You're only a Bioroid!
How dare you get in my way!
Olympus Military
They are so stupid
Always making a scene
Synchro-test completed
No problems found
Now you only need to adjust the safety belt
Before I do, can you clarify for me again
Why the reduction in shock-absorption material?
I already told you
it's the dynamic structure
that itself absorbs most of the shock
But the cartilage has many structures
Joints, bearings, depressor mechanisms
are self-restrained, soft-shelled units
and will dislocate under too much stress
Yoshitsune-kun
This is Deunan Knute, you needn't worry
But I've never a seen a woman
who can operate a Land Mate
OK, let me try
Help me adjust the belt
Deunan
Yoshitsune is the best mechanic in Olympus
When it comes to Land Mates
You should look into Hecatonchires next
Next time, please let me see your inner structure
You better just forget it
I'm blushing already
All secured?
Yep, no problem
OK, this is the ignition switch
First you need to practice
easy does it
That's the way
What is it?
The emergency launch alarm!
Unidentified Land Mates
are invading Gaia Research Center!
ESWAT launch immediately!
What are you waiting for?
Move it!
That's fine. I'm moving out now
Like that?!
Deunan!
Stop!
Here they come
Now target
Deunan
Wait! Don't come this way!
Drop your weapon!
Deunan!
Briareos
Sorry
What mindless waste
DNA systems for the life-extension
have also been destroyed
They entered via the underground elevator shaft
They broke through all 7 levels of Security System
No sign they were from outside Olympus
We don't know who those Land Mates belonged to
This is just too much!
We can only accept human reality
and take on their burden
We have no alternatives left
As of now, seal the entire perimeter
of Tartarus and Daedalus!
No one is permitted to access D-tank
Yes, Ma'am
Call for an emergency meeting immediately!
