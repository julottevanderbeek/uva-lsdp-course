BRUCE:
-
ALFRED:  Master Wayne!
- Bruce!
Martha.
BRUCE: In the dream,
they took me to the light.
- Bruce.
Jack, listen to me.
I want you to get everyone
out of the building right now.
- Oh, my God.
- WOMAN:
-
Let's go. Come on.
Start moving now, people. Let's go.
The boss wants us out of the building,
so let's make it happen.
Jack. Jack!
-
-
-
- OPERATOR:
All circuits are busy now.
Will you please try your call again later?
Heavenly God,
creator of Heaven and Earth,
have mercy on my soul.
-
-
Jack!
Buddy hands! Everybody show me! Good job!
Come on, guys.
-
- Go.
WALLACE:
Mr. Wayne! I can't feel my legs.
-
- I can't feel my legs.
- We need help over here!
-
Help me. I can't feel my legs.
You're gonna be okay. You hear me?
Wallace?
What do they call you, Wally? Huh?
You're the boss, boss.
All right. You're gonna be okay.
Easy, easy. Come on.
Oh, my God.
I can't move my leg.
My God. I can't feel my legs.
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.
- You're okay. All right? Huh?
-
You know what? We're gonna find your mom.
Where is she?
All that wind is bad luck.
Blood in the sky.
Oh, there she is!
Miss Lane.
Photographer. Obviously.
Where's Heron?
Uh, trouble at the border.
So, uh, how'd you land it?
This is, like, pioneer stuff.
Amajagh's never given an interview.
You know what Heron always
says when we're on assignment together?
Not a goddamn thing.
I like Heron.
Let's go.
TRANSLATOR: Passports.
Electronics. Phones. Camera.
Your fixer said that
the general approved photos.
Are you a terrorist, General?
They did not tell me the interview
was with a lady.
I'm not a lady. I'm a journalist.
GENERAL AMAJAGH: What I am
is a man with nothing
Who's paying for these
security contractors, General?
Who pays for the drones
that pass over our heads at night?
GENERAL AMAJAGH:
It's just a camera.
The United States
has declared its neutrality
in your country's civil war
both in policy and in principle.
Don't open... You just exposed...
These pious American fictions...
Okay. That's my film.
Men with power obey
neither policy nor principle, Miss Lane.
No one is neutral.
CIA.
They're tracking us!
You!
You're CIA?
What? No. No!
- You brought him here!
- No, he's a photographer.
- No!
-
It's okay, Lois.
Talon's down, sir.
Python, we have lost our
asset on the ground.
Repeat, we have lost our
asset on the ground.
PYTHON: There's still a civilian in
the compound. We'll extract her.
Negative. RPA to engage.
Stand down and get black.
There'll be friendlies
in the blast zone, so...
Call off the goddamn drone.
Stand down is an order. Python?
Let's move!
I...
I didn't know.
Ignorance is not the same as innocence,
Miss Lane.
- Get up! Stand up!
-
Quickly. He's coming.
Inbound 2 mikes.
Move out!
- PILOT: Target locked.
- You are clear to engage.
PILOT: Armed hot and in range.
-
Two. One.
Link's been hit.
By what?
Take one step,
you will see the inside of her head.
KAHINA: The women
in the village heard a noise.
Like the sky cracked open.
He came down. Then came fire.
My parents tried to run.
The world has been so caught up
with what Superman can do
that no one has asked what he should do.
Let the record show that this
committee holds him responsible.
KAHINA:
He answers to no one.
Not even, I think, to God.
ANNOUNCER 1:
Metropolis, again,
blowing out Gotham City.
ANNOUNCER 2: Really, only the diehards
are left in the stands.
DISPATCHER: Delta Charlie 27.
Reports of screams coming from vacant home
ANNOUNCER 1: Tom, it's been great
working with you.
I want to thank our
producer and director.
- Now wait a second.
- I don't even want to suggest...
DISPATCHER:
Just take a knee.
ANNOUNCER 1: They're lining up as if
Clarkson is gonna throw it deep here.
- ANNOUNCER 2: Don't tell me, Dave.
- Going to the end zone!
ANNOUNCER 2: This is unnecessary.
DISPATCHER: Delta Charlie 27.
ANNOUNCER 1: Zeke Baker is open.
Baker with a touchdown catch!
I can't believe
I just watched that.
DISPATCHER: Delta Charlie 27.
Do you copy?
ANNOUNCER 2: And now
a fight breaks out.
Gotham City, you know
how they are about their football team.
Things could get ugly
in the city tonight.
Go.
OFFICER RUCKA: It's okay.
It's okay.
We're gonna help.
We're here to help.
We're gonna get you out of here. Okay?
I don't understand.
-
-
CESAR: Please don't.
Please don't.
Christ!
I saw him.
I never saw him before.
I... I didn't know.
You almost took my face off.
How about you don't shoot
the good guys, huh?
Oh. Oh.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I was gonna cook.
Surprise you.
They held hearings about what happened.
- I don't care.
I don't care what they're saying.
The woman I love could have
been blown up or shot.
Well, think about what did happen.
I didn't kill those men,
if that's what they think.
If that's what you're saying.
No, I'm saying
I want to understand what happened.
I'm saying thank you for saving my life.
I just don't know if it's possible.
Don't know if what's possible?
For you to love me and be you.
Clark!
Clark, you're going
to flood the apartment.
- Mmm-hmm.
-
BRUCE: You still working?
You're getting slow
in your old age, Alfred.
Comes to us all, Master Wayne.
Even you got too old to die young.
And not for lack of trying.
Funnel-ferry butterbar.
Funnel-ferry butterbar.
There's nothing wrong
with the microphone.
It's this new layer of armor.
I'll just have to rewire.
So, last night was productive?
No. He's too low-level. He knew nothing.
This is the man who knows things.
Anatoli Knyazev. He's Russian.
Contracts all over the globe,
ALFRED: So the White Portuguese
is a Russian.
That's the theory.
No. The theory is that the Russian
will lead me to the man himself.
If he is, indeed, a "him."
You don't even know if he exists.
Could be a phantasm.
One that wants to bring
a dirty bomb into Gotham?
Ah, high-stakes round.
ALFRED:
BRUCE: We're criminals,
Alfred.
We've always been criminals.
Nothing's changed.
Oh, yes, it has, sir.
Everything's changed.
The gods hurl thunderbolts.
The feeling of powerlessness.
It turns good men cruel.
PLAYER:
Ooh. Ah. Ahoy, ahoy!
I did not know you were here.
- Man on the marquee.
- Yeah, don't believe it.
My father named the company
after himself.
He was the Lex in front of the Corp.
How you doin'?
Really great.
Really great? Good. Good.
Uh, follow me.
No, uh, Dad started saying
that he named the company,
after his kid at investor pitches.
Rich old ladies.
They thought it was very cute, you know?
"Write checks for Lex."
You know, Dad was born in East Germany.
He grew up eating stale crackers.
And every other Saturday,
he had to march in a parade
and wave flowers at tyrants.
So, I think it was providence
that his son, me,
would end up with this.
One of my Rebuild Metropolis
crews found it.
Little souvenir from
the Kryptonian World Engine.
What does a rock have to do
with homeland security?
Homeland security? Hmm.
No, no, no, ma'am, planetary security.
The fragment
is of a radioactive xenomineral.
We suspected it might
have bio-interactions,
so we took the sample to AMRIID,
where they keep the remains
of the Kryptonian decedent.
And, when we exposed
General Zod to the mineral,
this happened.
Profound biodegradation.
Decaying Kryptonian cells.
We concluded the mineral
could be weaponized
if a large enough sample was found.
And then, among the fishes, a whale.
Emerald City.
but what he needs from you
is an import license.
And why would we want to
weaponize this material?
LEX:
A silver bullet to keep in reserve,
to use against the Kryptonians,
so the day does not come, madam,
when your children are waving
daisies at a reviewing stand.
Last I looked, the only one of those
flying around up here was Superman.
Ha-ha, yes. Superman.
Yeah, but there are...
The metahuman thesis.
LEX:
these exceptional beings live among us.
The basis of our myths.
Gods among men upon
our little blue planet here.
Now, you don't have to use
a silver bullet.
But if you forge one...
Well, then
we don't have to depend
upon the kindness of monsters.
There are ways we can help each other.
Would you step
into my office here?
Yes.
What's your wish list?
Access to the wreck of
the crashed Kryptonian ship?
Done.
The complete remains
of the dead alien for testing.
You want Zod's body?
Okay.
-
- Mmm.
It's cherry.
Mmm-mmm.
KAHINA:
for the world to hear
the other side of the story.
They say that Superman is a hero.
Okay, but whose hero?
REPORTER: If Superman
were here right now,
KAHINA: That my family,
too, had dreams.
To look him in his eye
and ask him how he decides
Sir, get down.
Sir, I said get down!
-
COP 2:
Lois! Crime lab, on three.
- This is Lane.
- PERRY:
You're Sports today.
I want you to go to Gotham,
follow up on football.
"Underdog Dreams Dashed:
Ten Yards Between Gotham and Glory."
Watch yourself over there in Gotham.
Don't let them take your lunch money.
Hey. Are you guys watching this?
a precautionary perimeter
around Heroes Park
while they brought the man down
from this beloved monument.
The suspect has been identified
as Wallace Vernon Keefe.
REPORTER: He'll be arraigned
on charges of vandalism,
and the felony charge of
making terrorist threats.
PERRY: Poor son of a bitch.
REPORTER:
- PERRY: Jenny.
- Hmm.
Headline, "End of Love Affair
with Man in the Sky,
Okay.
Is she in?
No, she's been gone.
POET: What'd she do,
officer?
I'm not a cop. I'm a reporter.
The young lady living here...
She hasn't been back.
In fact, if she's smart,
then she's got out of this city.
And you need to
get out of here before dark.
Unless you want to run into him.
WOMAN:
Only people scared of him,
people who got reason to be.
Scared of who?
There's a new kind of mean in him.
He is angry.
And he's hunting.
-
-
WOMAN:
Let's go. Come on!
MAN: Throw a punch,
will ya?
Let's go! Come on!
Thank you.
The house treats luck like an insult.
Good luck for one is always
his brother's misfortune.
Three nights with a Bolshoi ballerina,
that line was all she taught me.
Not all, I'm sure. Good evening.
CLARK: It's like a one-man
reign of terror.
This Bat vigilante has been
consistently targeting the port
and the adjacent projects and tenements.
And, as far as I can tell,
the cops are actually helping him.
"Crime Wave in Gotham."
Other breaking news, "Water, Wet."
Did you file the football yet?
Why aren't we covering this?
-
People don't buy papers, period, Kent.
Perry, when you assign a story,
you're making a choice about who matters.
And who's worth it.
Good morning, Smallville.
The American conscience died
with Robert, Martin, and John.
No match. My guys in the crime lab
never seen one before.
It's called a bullet.
You shoot people with them.
Recovered from the scene
of the firefight in the desert.
Not sold anywhere
commercially in the world,
even black market.
So who gave prototype military rounds
to Tuareg fighters in the Sahara?
You're the reporter. Tell me.
I think that the US government
is arming the rebels
while claiming to support
the elected government.
The Ask, Lois.
Flight to D.C. tonight.
Couple of days there.
Go.
Coach. No extra legroom.
Economy plus.
Coach!
CLARK: So,
why didn't you tell me?
You're digging up snakes, Lo.
It's kind of dangerous.
That is why I didn't tell you.
PERRY: Lane, don't you
have a plane to catch?
Yes, sir.
Benefit for the Library of Metropolis.
Someone on the committee
requested that Clark Kent cover it.
Probably some old charity crone
who's got a thing for nerds.
LEX:
Little bourbon before lunch?
My driver's outside. I can't stay.
LEX: No bourbon?
Kentucky girl like yourself?
Hmm.
My dad always said that Kentucky mash
was the secret to health.
Mmm.
This was his room.
I kept it just the same.
Mmm.
"Maybe one day Dad'll come back
if I just keep everything the same."
That is silly.
The magical thinking of orphan boys.
I'm blocking the import
license for your mineral.
The redcapes are coming.
The redcapes are coming.
Hmm...
You and your hearings.
Galloping through the streets to warn us.
One if by land, two if by air.
-
- Mmm.
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?
Can I call you June?
You can call me whatever you like.
Take a bucket of piss and
call it Granny's Peach Tea.
Mmm-hmm.
Take a weapon of assassination
and call it deterrence.
You won't fool a fly or me.
I'm not gonna drink it.
You don't think Dad would mind, do you?
If I changed just...
Just one thing in this room?
Because that should be upside-down.
We know better now, don't we?
The devils don't come
from Hell beneath us. No.
No, they come from the sky.
Oh.
I hope the next generation of Waynes
won't inherit an empty wine cellar.
Not that there's likely
to be a next generation.
This is every call made
from the Russian's phone.
Two mentions of business
with the White Portuguese.
And it's continually
transmitting blacked-out data
to the personal residence
of Alexander Luthor.
You think Lex Luthor
is the White Portuguese?
I can't see that he needs the income
from imported arms.
Regardless, I'll need to put
a leech at his house,
and I'm gonna need the suit.
The Bat interrogated six people
and came away with nothing.
It was Bruce Wayne
that got the information.
Well, Bruce Wayne can't
break into Lex Luthor's house.
Bruce Wayne won't have to.
He's been invited.
Who's that?
You must be new to
the "let them eat cake" beat.
That is Bruce Wayne.
LEBLANC: Philanthropist,
bibliophile...
True friend of the Library of Metropolis.
Mr. Lex Luthor.
-
- Me? Ah. Okay.
Nicky. Uh...
You're embarrassing me.
Um...
-
The word "philanthropist"
comes from the Greek.
Meaning a lover of humanity.
All right. Where am I going, Alfred?
Go past the elevator.
Do a left.
It's in the service corridor
in the basement.
LEX: Gods and men.
Prometheus went with us.
And he ruined Zeus' plan
to destroy mankind,
and for that he was given a thunderbolt.
On a serious note,
the Library of Metropolis...
Go to the stairs. You saw them
on your way in. Down the stairs.
LEX: But at one time,
Dad could not buy them. No.
My father could not afford
books growing up.
He had to root through the garbage
for yesterday's newspaper.
All right.
You got the kitchens on your right.
Right in front of you.
That's where you want to be.
May I help you, Mr. Wayne?
I just...
I thought the bathroom was down here.
I must have...
That last martini was
two too many, I think.
Men's room is upstairs.
Great. I'm okay.
I like those shoes.
-
- I can't stay down here, Alfred.
ALFRED: Go upstairs
and socialize.
Some young lady from Metropolis
will make you honest.
In your dreams, Alfred.
LEX:
and knowledge is power,
and I am...
No. Uh, um...
No. What am I? I...
What was I saying? No.
The bittersweet pain among men
is having knowledge with
no power, because...
Because that is paradoxical!
And, um...
Thank you for coming.
Mr. Wayne? Mr. Wayne?
Clark Kent, Daily Planet.
My foundation has
already issued a statement
in support of books.
- Sir?
- Um...
Wow. Pretty girl. Bad habit.
Don't quote me. All right?
What's your position on
the Bat vigilante in Gotham?
Do I own this one?
Or is that the other guy?
Civil liberties are being
trampled on in your city.
Good people are living in fear.
Don't believe everything you hear, son.
I've seen it, Mr. Wayne.
He thinks he's above the law.
criticizing
those who think they're above the law
is a little hypocritical,
wouldn't you say?
Considering every time
your hero saves a cat out of a tree,
you write a puff piece editorial
about an alien who, if he wanted to,
could burn the whole place down.
There wouldn't be a damn thing
we could do to stop him.
Most of the world doesn't
share your opinion, Mr. Wayne.
Maybe it's the Gotham City in me.
We just have a bad history
with freaks dressed like clowns.
LEX:
Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent. Ha!
I love it.
I love bringing people together.
How are we?
- Lex.
- Hello. Good.
Hi, hello, Lex, it is a pleasure.
Wow! That is a good grip!
You should not pick a fight
with this person.
So, after all these years,
we finally got you over to Metropolis.
Well, I thought I'd come drink you dry.
Well, you're welcome.
You should hop the harbor
more often, though.
I'd love to show you my labs.
Maybe we could partner on something.
My R and D is up to all sorts of no good.
That's seven minutes.
- Mr. Luthor.
- Yes?
- The governor.
- Governor.
- Excuse me.
- Next time.
Governor! Hi!
GOVERNOR:
Lex, it's good to see you.
BRUCE: Excuse me.
VIKRAM GANDHI:
And when this savior character
actually comes to Earth,
We have to understand that
this a paradigm shift.
We have to start thinking
beyond politics.
ANDREW SULLIVAN: Are there any moral
constraints on this person?
On this Earth,
every act is a political act.
CHARLIE ROSE:
Uh, to have
an individual engaging
GLEN WOODBURN: Human beings
have a horrible track record
down paths that led to
huge human atrocities.
GANDHI: We have always
created icons in our own image.
What we've done is
we project ourselves onto him.
The fact is, maybe he's not
some sort of devil or Jesus character.
Maybe he's just a guy
trying to do the right thing.
NEIL deGRASSE TYSON: We're talking
about a being whose very existence
challenges our own
sense of priority in the universe.
and you find out we're not
special on this Earth,
special in the entire universe
because there is Superman.
CHARLIE ROSE: Are you,
as a United States senator,
personally comfortable saying
to a grieving parent,
"but on principle,
we did not want him to act"?
MARTHA:
CLARK:
Clark!
What is it? What's wrong?
Hi.
Hi.
How come Dad never left Kansas?
Well, he just...
You know how he was.
"What do I need to travel for?
"I'm already there."
Just wish it was more simple.
My baby boy.
Nothing was ever simple.
JENET: An odd little duck.
I've never seen a metal like this.
Could be DARPA black box.
Who could find out?
Nobody who'd want to.
Maybe they gave them
out to the rebels to test in theater.
Using live soldiers as guinea pigs?
This is what makes you
such a good reporter.
Stuff like this still shocks you.
CESAR: It don't come off!
It don't come off!
COP 1: Prisoner transfer!
You can't put me in general, man.
They gonna kill me.
Hey, you can't bring me to general.
You should be thanking
the tax payers of Metropolis
for taking in your branded ass.
- COP 1: Sign here, please.
- I'm marked, man.
You know what they do
to people with this on them?
-
- COP 2: He's only a criminal.
- This way! Let's go!
- They're gonna kill me!
- GUARD: Let's go!
Keefe. You made bail.
Open two.
Who paid?
Who the hell are you?
Just a man.
Yeah? Well, what the fuck do you want?
To help you stand for something.
Your three o'clock's here.
He made me half a man.
My wife walked out on me.
I can't even piss standing up.
You'll take care of it?
Good.
What?
Wrong room, miss.
Secretary Swanwick,
you haven't been
returning my phone calls.
Miss Lane, if you'd like an interview,
Major Farris is just outside that door.
You're treating me like a stranger?
I'm treating you like a reporter.
All right. Is the US providing
experimental military arms
to rebels in Africa?
You know, with balls like yours,
you belong in here.
What's your source on this?
A tin foil hat?
No, not tin. But it's metal.
Fired in the Superman incident.
Experts at the Pentagon can't ID it.
We haven't been told the truth.
Here's the truth.
A reporter got greedy for a scoop
and went where she shouldn't have.
Superman acted like some rogue combatant
to rescue her, and people died.
Don't invent a conspiracy
theory to put back his halo.
Or yours.
- Major.
- FARRIS:
PERRY:
I logged into your Dropbox to find copy.
There's copy all right.
But nothing about football.
Nothing about the friends
of the Metropolis Library,
just the goddamn Gotham Bat thing
I told you not to pursue.
If the police won't help,
the press has to do the right thing.
You don't get to decide
what the right thing is.
When the Planet was founded,
it stood for something, Perry.
And so could you if it was 1938,
but it's not 1938.
WPA ain't hiring no more.
Apples don't cost a nickel.
Not in here, not out there.
You drop this thing!
Nobody cares about Clark Kent
taking on the Batman.
JON STEWART:
doesn't want us to think of him
as American anymore.
one-third of the USA's
initials on his chest.
the Declaration of
Independence as a cape is...
- MANAGER:
- No.
Guys, come on. Let's go.
I wonder, would you excuse us?
- There's something I'd like to show you.
- I'm sorry.
Now some scholars insist
that it never happened...
But I believe it's the action
perfectly in keeping with a king
who was also a psychopathic killer.
For me, it's the culmination
of 40 years curating.
And I can't believe it,
but I've finally got it here.
It's the Sword of Alexander.
It's the blade that cut the Gordian knot.
It's a triumph.
DIANA: Yes.
JAMES HARMON:
DIANA:
It's a fake.
The real one was sold
in '98 on the black market.
And now it hangs...
Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, miss.
The other night you took something
that doesn't belong to you.
Stealing's not polite.
Is it stealing if you steal
from another thief?
Who are you?
Someone interested
in the same man you are.
Is that right?
I believe Mr. Luthor has a photograph
that belongs to me.
Did you get it?
As it happens, no, I didn't.
The data you copied has
military-grade encryption.
You know, I bet with that dress,
get away with anything.
But you're the 10th?
I'm guessing I'm the first
to see through that
babe-in-the-woods act.
You don't know me,
but I've known a few women like you.
I don't think you've ever
known a woman like me.
You know, it's true what
they say about little boys.
Born with no natural
inclination to share.
I didn't steal your drive. I borrowed it.
You'll find it in the glove
compartment of your car.
Mr. Wayne.
Did you get it?
The rock?
Yeah, we got it.
I'm sorry.
Get down! Get down now!
No!
She was my world.
And you took her from me.

- THE FLASH:
Bruce! Listen to me now!
It's Lois!
It's Lois Lane!
Am I too soon?
I'm too soon!
Fear him! Fear him!
Find us, Bruce!
BRUCE:
Master Wayne, since the age of seven
you have been to the art of deception
as Mozart to the harpsichord.
But you've never been
too hot at lying to me.
The  is not
carrying a dirty bomb.
It's a weapon.
It's a rock.
A mineral capable of weakening
Kryptonian cells.
The first sample big enough
to mean something
turned up in the Indian Ocean
three months ago.
It is now aboard the
being delivered to Lex Luthor.
Who I am going to steal it from.
To keep it out of Luthor's hands.
To destroy it.
No.
You're gonna go to war?
That son of a bitch brought
the war to us two years ago.
Jesus, Alfred. Count the dead.
Thousands of people.
What's next? Millions?
He has the power to wipe out
the entire human race,
and if we believe there's even
a 1 % chance that he is our enemy,
we have to take it
as an absolute certainty.
And we have to destroy him.
But he is not our enemy.
Not today.
We've seen what promises are worth.
How many good guys are left.
How many stayed that way.
My name is Clark Kent.
I'm from the
I'm trying to find out
what happened to an inmate,
a Santos.
I can't give out that information.
Mommy!
Mrs. Santos?
He wasn't my husband.
But I know what he did.
But he was a father. He was that, too.
They took him out of Gotham Central.
They moved him to Metropolis.
But inside they know.
They know the mark all over.
Guards don't care.
Bat's the judge.
One man decides who lives.
- How is that justice?
- Talk to me.
- Help me change it.
- With what? Your pen?
A man like that, words don't stop him.
You know stops him? A fist.
PERRY: Kent, I want
to talk to you.
Kent!
Where does he go?
Where does he go, Jenny?
I don't... I don't know.
Clicks his heels three times,
goes back to Kansas, I suppose.
Son of a...
WORKER:
Move out!
Go, go, go, go!
No!

Where is he?

Next time they shine
your light in the sky,
don't go to it.
The Bat is dead. Bury it.
Consider this mercy.
BRUCE:
I don't have a halo over me,
Mr. Secretary.
I went into the desert, people died.
It keeps me awake. It should.
If you think that Superman is a murderer,
then throw it away.
But I don't believe you think that.
FINCH: How do we determine
what's good?
In a democracy, good is a conversation,
-
So I urge Superman to come
The world needs to know
what happened in that desert.
MARTHA: People hate
what they don't understand.
But they see what you do,
and they know who you are.
You're not a killer, a threat.
I never wanted this world to have you.
Be their hero, Clark. Be their monument.
Be their angel.
Be anything they need you to be.
Or be none of it.
You don't owe this world a thing.
You never did.
DRIVER: This is DeNiros.

KAHINA:
RECEPTIONIST:
KAHINA: I need to speak to her
before the hearing.
RECEPTIONIST:
KAHINA:
Please, madam. I beg of you!
Please don't do this!
- OFFICER: Come with me.
- Don't touch me!
- Please!
- I'm sorry. She wouldn't leave.
I didn't tell you the truth.
C.I. thinks the desert was a setup.
Somebody wanted Superman to look guilty.
The bullet?
The metal was developed
by a private company.
What company?
LexCorp.
Lex Luthor?
He also had private security contractors
at the desert compound.
Go on record.
Not a chance. It's classified.
I happen to like my job.
It doesn't make sense.
You said that the ambush was
arranged to frame Superman,
but how could they know
that he'd show up in the...
In the middle of the desert. Thank you.

-
The Senate hearing is expected
to get underway any minute now.
And of course the big
unknown in all of this is
will Superman show up?
That is what they're really
waiting to see.
Mr. Keefe. Mr. Keefe.
Soledad O'Brien,
Quick question for you.
You're heading in
to meet with the senators.
What will you tell them?
KEEFE: I've come here
to tell them to wake up.
This is what war looks like.
I have nothing.
There are plenty of people,
sir, who would say he's their hero.
Grace, can you get Greg up here, please?
Right now.
An anonymous source can verify everything
I told you about what
happened in Nairomi.
- An anonymous source?
- Run it.
Luthor engineered the desert.
It was an ambush for Superman.
Trust your reporter. Think Watergate.
If you're wrong, Luthor will
sue the paper out of existence.
No. It needs to run now.
If Superman knows,
it might change what he says.
I am not going to risk the paper
so that you can pass notes in class
to the man that rescued you.
McGRAW:
Not only paid her.
He threatened her.
Gave her a script to learn.
Her parents are alive back home.
But the girl's got a conscience.
He's been using the committee
as his puppet theater.
Senator!
Hi, you.
Don't go anywhere. I want to talk to you.
Uh, you know what?
Mercy, you go in and make sure
no one takes my seat.
So what you been up to?
I'm just here to tell my story.
That I was willing to finance
a Kryptonian deterrent,
but a certain junior senator from Kentucky
decided to block it.
Yes, the chair of the committee
on Superman is soft on security.
Greg, why hasn't he been
getting our checks?
He is, Mr. Wayne.
He gets a check from
the Victims Fund every month.
GREG: He returns them.
DANA BASH:
BRUCE: Jesus.
Why haven't I seen this?
GREG: I'm sorry.
I'll get to the bottom of it.
BASH:
He is actually
at the United States Capitol.
to the American people,
and, of course, to the world.
He's here. He came.
- He's above the Capitol.
- Ah.
You are gonna be on the
hot seat in there, Junebug.
I grew up on a farm.
I know how to wrestle a pig.
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?
It's that power can be innocent.
Good luck.
- Oh, miss...
-
Rudy, she's good to go.
Get out!
- Get out! Get out!
- Superman! Superman!
GREG: Another one came
this morning, Mr. Wayne.

Let me say at the outset
that I'm grateful to our witness
for coming before us today.
This is how a democracy works.
We talk to each other.
We act by the consent

Excuse me, officer.
Member of the press.
Can you let me in, please?
PARAMEDIC: Breathe slowly and deeply.
You're gonna be fine.
Thank you.
I'm gonna need a little room to work.
Ma'am, it appears you've
suffered a head injury.
I'm gonna need you
to follow my light with your eyes.
Mr. Wayne!
REPORTER:...in the Senate hearing room

This is a catastrophic
situation at our nation's Capitol.

more than a dozen people
Now initially, Superman was helping

Carrie Birmingham,

REPORTER 2: Capitol police are now
confirming that the blast was caused
by an explosive device
inside the hearing room.
OFFICER:
- Can you enhance that?
- There you go, sir.
REPORTER ON TV:
Clark, it's me again. Can you...
...could have gotten
the explosive device into the hearing
As for Superman, he was in the room,
but obviously failed to stop him.
I didn't see it, Lo.
I was standing right there
and I didn't see it.
Clark, there are people behind this.
I'm afraid I didn't see it
because I wasn't looking.
All this time,
I've been living my life
the way my father saw it.
Righting wrongs for a ghost.
Thinking I'm here to do good.
Superman was never real.
Just the dream of a farmer from Kansas.
That farmer's dream
is all some people have.
It's all that gives them hope.
This means something.
It did on my world.
My world doesn't exist anymore.
KRYPTONIAN SHIP VOICE:

JENNY:
"if Superman was aware of
the threat and did nothing,
"was he then complicit
in the Capitol tragedy?"
Still no Kent?
JENNY: "His disappearance
raises questions."
No.
DANA BASH: There are still so many
unanswered questions.
whether Superman was involved
in the planning of this attack.
I mean, here's an individual
who has unlimited power,
yet did nothing to stop the bomber
just a few feet away from him.
CROWD:
For 20 American, he didn't see you.
Same for me.
REPORTER: Now one FBI official
familiar with this case
"A jackpot of bomb-making materials

whether he had any help in the planning
and execution of the bombing.
And they haven 't ruled out the idea
that Superman was a co-conspirator.
they are getting a barrage of anonymous
and credible tips
with all roads in this investigation
leading to the Kryptonian visitor.
All right, Lois. You gotta go.
He didn't know he was gonna die.
He just bought groceries.
The wheelchair and
the bullet from the desert
were made from the same metal.
I know. The desert. The hearing.
Everywhere Superman goes,
Luthor wants death.
JENET: But, Luthor goes
through all of that trouble...
Creates a bomb out of a wheelchair,
and then alters it to reduce the blast?
What do you mean?
The inside of the chair
was lined with lead.
You couldn't stop it.
You couldn't see it.
Something, isn't it?
We men of Kansas live on a pancake,
so we come to the mountains.
All downhill from here,
down to the floodplain.
Farm at the bottom of the world.
I remember one season the water came bad.
I couldn't have been 12.
Dad had out the shovels
and we went at it all night.
We worked till, I think, I fainted.
But we managed to stop the water.
We saved the farm.
Your grandma baked me a cake.
Said I was a hero.
Later that day we found out
we blocked the water all right.
We sent it upstream.
The whole Lang farm washed away.
While I ate my hero cake,
their horses were drowning.
I used to hear them wailing in my sleep.
Did the nightmares ever stop?
Yeah.
When I met your mother.
She gave me faith that
there's good in this world.
I miss you, son.
I miss you too, Dad.
ALFRED: You know you can't win this.
It's suicide.
I'm older now than my father ever was.
This may be the only thing
I do that matters.

Criminals are like weeds, Alfred.
Pull one up, another grows in its place.
This is about the future of the world.
This is my legacy.
My father sat me down right here.
Told me what Wayne Manor was built on.
Railroads, real estates, and oil.
The first generation made their fortune
trading with the French.
Pelts and skins.
They were hunters.
So falls the house of Wayne.
NANCY GRACE: We gotta wait for more
evidence, but the question still remains,

The night is here.
Excuse me.
Don't I know...
Plain Lo in the morning. Lola in slacks.
Lois Lane.
Mmm. Come see the view.
Um...  Mmm-mmm.
Now the secret to the height
is the building material.
It's light metals
which sway a bit in the wind.
Hmm.
And you know something
about LexCorp metals,
don't you, Miss Lane?
I've proven what you've done.
Wow, you're feisty.
Unfortunately, that will blow away.
Like sand in the desert.
You're psychotic.
That is a three-syllable word
for any thought too big for little minds.
Hmm. Next category: circles.
Round and round
and round they go to find Superman.
Wrong category, boy.
No, no, triangles.
Yes, Euclid's triangle inequality.
The shortest distance
between any two points
is a straight path.
And I believe
the straightest path to Superman
is a pretty little road...
Mmm. Called Lois Lane.
You came back.
You came back.
Boy, do we have problems up here!
The problem of... Of evil in the world.
Uh, the problem of absolute virtue.
I'll take you in without breaking you.
Which is more than you deserve.
The problem of you
on top of everything else.
You above all.
Ah, because that's what God is.
Horus. Apollo. Jehovah. Kal-El.
Clark Joseph Kent.
See, what we call God
depends upon our tribe, Clark-Joe.
Because God is tribal. God takes sides.
No man in the sky intervened
when I was a boy
to deliver me from
Daddy's fist and abominations. Mmm.
I figured out way back,
if God is all-powerful,
he cannot be all-good.
And if he is all-good,
then he cannot be all-powerful.
And neither can you be.
They need to see the fraud you are.
With their eyes.
The blood on your hands.
What have you done?
Hmm. And tonight, they will.
Yes. Because you, my friend,
have a date. Hmm.
Across the bay.
Ripe fruit, his hate. Two years growing.
But it did not take much
to push him over, actually.
Little red notes, big bang.
You let your family die!
And now you will fly to him.
And you will battle him.
To the death.
Black and blue. Fight Night!
The greatest gladiator match
in the history of the world.
- God versus man.
-
Day versus night.
Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham.
You think I'll fight him for you?
Hmm, yes, I do.
I think you will fight-fight-fight
for that special lady in your life.
She's safe on the ground. How about you?
Close, but I am not talking about Lois.
No.
Every boy's special lady is his mother.
Martha, Martha, Martha.
Hmm.
Why, the mother of a flying demon
must be a witch.
The punishment for witches, what is that?
That's right. Death by fire.
Mmm.
Where is she?
I don't know!
I would not let them tell me!
Uh-uh-uh! If you kill me, Martha dies.
And if you fly away, mmm,
Martha also dies.
But if you kill the Bat...
Martha lives.
There we go. There we go. Hmm.
And now God bends to my will.
Ooh, now the cameras
are waiting at your ship.
For the world to see
the holes in the holy.
Yes, the Almighty comes clean
about how dirty he is when it counts.
To save Martha,
bring me the head of the Bat.
Ah.
Mother of God, would you look at the time?
When you came here, you had an hour.
Now it's less.
ANDERSON COOPER:
Brooke, you're live on the air.
What are you seeing?
There's something happening at the ship.
It's sending massive power surges.
ERIKA ERICKSON:
They've created a barricade
around this containment center.
And we're trying to get
a little bit closer here
You can see that lightning,
those surges of electricity.
They seem to be getting
stronger by the minute.
Lois.
I have to go to Gotham
to convince him to help me.
Who?
Or he has to die.
Clark.
No one stays good in this world.
ERICKSON: But as of right now, much of
the city remains in the dark tonight.
Much confusing happening
on the streets of Metropolis tonight.
Those helicopters are still
surrounding the area.
I don't know if you can
still see those bolts of lightning...
2400 hours and 2 minutes.

Chopper? We can barely afford a bicycle.
You wanna chase a story? Go to the ship.
Superman's probably there already.
Perry, it's not for a story.
Jenny, get her a chopper to Gotham.
And forget the heliport.
Put it on the goddamn roof.
On the roof, Lois!
Where are we headed?
There!
Bruce. Please.
I was wrong. You have to listen to me.
Lex wants us to...
You don't understand.
There's no time!
Stay down!
If I wanted it, you'd be dead already.
I bet your parents taught you
that you mean something.

You're letting him kill Martha.
Find him.
Save
THOMAS:
Martha.
Clark! Stop!
Please! Stop!
It's his mother's name!
It's his mother's name.

We're still right outside
the containment center.
A dangerous situation.
Military and police personnel
surrounding the area.
CLARK:
He wanted your life for hers.
She's losing time.
The scout ship seems to be
drawing power from the city.
It's got to be Lex.
They need you at that ship.
I'll find her.
- My mother needs me.
- Wait.
ALFRED:
Uh, I'm sorry for listening in,
but I've tracked the Russian's phone
to a warehouse near the port.
No, sir. You don't.
KNYAZEV: I'm afraid this is goodbye.
And every time we say goodbye,
you die a little.
MAN 1: Take it down.
MAN 2: Go! Go!
Ah, right.
Commencing drone mode.

Why don't I drop you off on the second?

Drop it.
I said drop it!
I'll kill her.
Believe me, I'll do it.
I figured.
The cape.

KRYPTONIAN SHIP VOICE:

KRYPTONIAN SHIP VOICE:

Uh, Gotham Roast. Well done.
Hello. Break the bad news.
BRUCE: I'd rather do
the breaking in person.
KRYPTONIAN SHIP VOICE:
You've lost.
I don't know how to lose.
- You'll learn.
-
I'll learn.
I don't hate the sinner.
- I hate the sin.
And yours, my friend, is existing.
I cannot let you win.
I gave the Bat a fighting chance to do it,
but he was not strong enough.
So, if man won't kill God...
KRYPTONIAN SHIP VOICE:
...the devil will do it!

JENNY: Perry!
PERRY: All right. Stay calm, everybody!
We're getting reports
there are total blackouts

the northwest of the city.
Federal authorities

Thankfully though, the work day is over

Now military aircraft.
Those are Apache helicopters.
They have now just arrived.

We've, uh... We just lost

How best to describe it?

BRUCE:
They might. If you had any left.
The spear. Alfred, the spear.
It's pure Kryptonite.
If I can penetrate the skin,
the spear will kill it.
It would in theory.
I've gotta get it to chase me
back to the city.

Why did you bring him back to the city?
BRUCE:
Did you find the spear?
This thing, this creature,
seems to feed on energy.
CLARK: This thing is from another world.
My world.
I've killed things
from other worlds before.
Is she with you?

No. No, Clark, you can't.

By whom?
Anonymous donor.
All those circuses back east

They don't know how to honor him,

I've failed him in life.
I won't fail him in death.
Help me find the others like you.
Perhaps they don't want to be found.
They will. And they'll fight.
We have to stand together.
From a century of horrors.
Man made a world where
standing together is impossible.
Men are still good.
BRUCE:
The others like me.
Why did you say they'll have to fight?
Just a feeling.

I'm gonna say this one more time.
The warden wants to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.
SUPERMAX GUARD:
Turn around and face the wall.
Place your forehead against the wall.
Put your hands behind your back,

Oh...
Look at us.
This is how it all caves in.
Civilization on the Wayne Manor's

Mmm?
But who would believe me?
I...
I'm insane.
I'm not even fit to stand trial.
That's right.
We have hospitals that treat
the mentally ill with compassion.

- But that's not where you're going.
I arranged for you to get transferred
to Arkham Asylum in Gotham.
I still have some friends there.
They're expecting you.
But the bell's already been rung.
And they've heard it.
Out in the dark.
Among the stars. Hmm.

But a bell cannot be unrung!
He's hungry. He's found us.
