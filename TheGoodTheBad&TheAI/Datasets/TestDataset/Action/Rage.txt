Hi, Sweetheart.
Hey, Daddy.
yöu know, yöu don't have to
pick me up, I can find a ride.
Yeah, I know, that's
what worries me.
What is that on the back
of yöur hand, Caitlin Maguire?
Relax, Dad, it's henna, okay?
Padma's mom did it for the girls in
class, we're studying Indian culture.
Indian Culture,
it washes-off, right?
Sort of, it will wear off.
I got these, the girl at the store
said they were the best ones.
Jeez, thank yöu, Dad.
yöu know, I don't... I don't
take the SAT's until next year.
It's never too early to
start preparing, right?
Oh, hey, can we stop at the
store for a couple of snacks?
The boys are coming over
after Mikey gets off work.
So, Mikey has a job, huh?
Yeah, not everyone at my
school is a rich snob, Dad.
Mikey's on scholarship and
he washes dishes at Denny's.
Have yöu finished
with yöur term paper?
- Totally.
- Totally.
All right, it's almost done, I just
have to proof it and print it.
I want that paper done before yöur
two little buddies come over,
otherwise yöu'll never finish.
Alea est iacta.
What?
The die is cast.
It's from "Julius Caesar", yöu know that thing
I've been working on for the past six weeks.
The die is cast.
It's impressive.
yöu got the date locked?
Next Saturday,
Caitlin's gonna love it,
the band's booked.
- She's got the whole place to herself.
- Good.
Caitlin's Sweet Sixteen,
damn, makes me feel old!
What are we gonna
do with the... those?
Don't worry about it,
I'll tell the bartenders
and waitresses, "No booze".
Not a drop,
Oh, okay.
Did yöu talk to the doorman,
"no meth at the door"?
- yöur doormen sell meth?
- Don't worry about it.
If I hear of anyone even
looking at Caitlin's friends funny,
I'll kick their asses myself.
No, no, no, wait a minute,
these are sixteen year-old kids.
Kane, I don't want any incidents.
We're not sixteen year-olds,
drinking and doing drugs,
like we're role models.
How much trouble did we used to
get into when we were their age?
yöu know, I seem to remember
yöu double-dipping Betsy,
the one with those wavy eyes.
That's right!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
Wasn't she yöur girl for a while?
She was for a while until I found-out that
this bad-ass was knocking his bot dong around.
Well, hey, we shared the
same honey-pot, right?
- It makes us milk-brothers.
- Romulus and Remus.
Well, this is what I
don't understand,
how would yöu remember who yöu bang,
I mean, yöu've been drinking a fifth
of Scotch a day since yöu were born?
About a bad-ass,
mean-ass man yöu was.
I'm gonna throw a great party,
yöu're a great dad.
I gotta run.
Take it easy, Paulie.
Oh, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor!
Mr. Mayor!
Can yöu please tell us how many jobs
will be provided on this project?
Yes... Phase One has already
created more than a hundred jobs,
local jobs, for this community.
And today we begin Phase Two.
And Phase Two means
that we'll have a park,
- as well as a river-walk.
- Mr. Maguire!
What do yöu intend to
do with the profits?
Thank yöu, Frank.
The Mayor and I feel
that this project will
certainly stimulate the economy and
we intend to put the money back into
education and medical, thank yöu.
Thank yöu all for coming.
Hey, are yöu almost ready? We're gonna be late
for dinner with the Thompsons and Dean White.
What does Dean White do exactly?
He works for the governor.
I think he's gonna run
for State Controller.
Good guy to know.
We're gonna need a
few extra contacts.
Do yöu prefer the Noir
tonight, or the Portofino?
Noir.
yöu know Princeton's nearly 40,000 a year
and that's not including room and board?
I know, can we swing it?
I got it covered.
We've got it covered.
We're a team here, right?
Yes, we are a team, but...
No, no buts! None of this "She's
my daughter" bullshit, all right?
I love the two of yöu, and I'm here
for yöu both, yöu got it?
yöu know, yöu're very sexy
when yöu put me in my place.
Is this yöu changing the subject?
I don't think we have time for this.
yöu are SUCH a tease.
I'm not gonna shit on no hellion.
Caitlin, yöur gonna be
staying home tonight, right?
Yeah, we just hanging-out here.
Good, because yöu have a lot of homework
that needs to be done by Monday,
- and yöu need to focus on yöur work.
- Okay, Dad.
I'm serious.
Dad, I know. Listen, we're
just gonna hang-out here,
watch TV or something.
Lisa might stop by, but that is it.
Michael, I hear yöu're a working man.
- Yes, sir.
- And how's that working out for yöu?
It sucks.
But it's nice for a buck or two,
and it's pretty flexible, yöu know?
This summer if yöu wanna make
some real money, yöu let me know,
I can put yöu on one of my crews.
Swinging a hammer pays a hell of a
lot more than working at Denny's.
yöu'd do that for me?
Yeah, if yöu give me a hand with
one of these boxes over here.
Okay.
- This?
- Yeah.
So, yöu gonna ask my daughter out?
What?
I see the way yöu're lookin' at her.
I didn't think yöu'd
let her go out, yöu know?
- yöu smoke weed?
- No.
- No drugs at all?
- No.
Well, then, I... I might....
be willing to make an exception.
Do yöu think she'd say, "Yes"?
The mind of a woman is
a mysterious thing.
I can't tell yöu
what she'll say, but...
"Fortune favors the bold."
yöu ready?
Yeah, I'm almost there, go start
the car, I'll be right there,
Caitlin, I 'm not yöur mother,
I'm not going to lecture
yöu about smoking,
although yöu shouldn't be smoking,
but the last time yöu and
yöur friends hung-out,
Paul found cigarette
butts in the back yard
- and I took the heat for it.
- He believe yöu?
Probably not, but
that's not the point.
- The look he gave me...
- I know the look.
- So, yöu understand?
- Yeah.
Yeah, Vanessa, I'll
be good, I promise.
Thank yöu.
yöu guys have a good night.
She's so hot.
Dickhead!
I think the dock area is the
perfect place to build,
that part of town is just
screaming for re-development.
Uh-huh, I heard yöu got a lot
going on in re-development.
How'd yöu get started in
the business, Mr. Maguire?
Oh, it's getting late, it's
already past midnight.
I'm sure everybody'd like
to go home and get some rest.
Paul doesn't like to brag,
but the truth of the matter is he
built his first development himself.
- A lot of hard work.
- That's what I've heard.
Well, I had a full crew
with me, but yeah...
my first job was swinging a hammer,
tends to drive my
foremen all crazy, but,
there's nothing that satisfies like a...
an honest day's work.
Love a guy that's not afraid to roll his
sleeves up and get his hands dirty.
Here's to an honest day's work!
To an honest day's work!
They're coming to get yöu, Barbara!
Stop it!
Hey, my dad kinda likes yöu.
It's funny.
Yeah, Mike go work for The Big Guy,
get in with the family,
next thing ya know,
yöu're marryin' Caitlin,
takin' over the business,
yöu'll be a made man in no time.
Cut it out, man!
Detective, yöu here for dinner?
- Paul, we need to talk.
- What seems to be the problem?
- I'm sorry, but it's urgent.
- This is not the time or the place.
Whatever this is, surely we can
discuss it in the morning.
Paul, listen to me,
this is not about yöu.
It's about Caitlin.
They called it in about an hour ago,
Michael and that other boy, Evan,
they sent him to the hospital
and got him a sedative.
He was really shaken-up.
What this Michael kid told us
was that all three of them
were together when it happened.
They were playing video games,
had a few drinks.
He said that Caitlin
tried to get away.
They say that she put
up a helluva fight.
This can't be happening.
Wha... wha... what about the
neighbors, did they see anything?
No, nothing.
I mean, who would break
into yöur house, grab yöur daughter,
there's no ransom demands, nothing.
I don't know, I don't have a problem
with anyone right now.
Right now, but think
about yöur past.
Who would have the
inclination to do this?
I know yöu still talk to O'Connell.
This is my daughter!
I would tell yöu if I had
any idea who was behind this.
Would yöu?
Pete, I 'm out of the
game, yöu know that!
- How long have we known each other?
- Since the massacre at the Four P's...
- Yes, fifteen years, Pete.
- Yeah, I know yöu.
Right! yöu do, yöu know me.
I just don't want yöu fallin' back
on any of the old habits.
Let us handle this our way,
all right, Paul?
Okay, fine, what's yöur way?
Well, we drop it on
the News right away.
Within, if it sits on yöur history.
How many times do we
have to tell yöu, that he's clean?
One of two things
is going-down here,
the kidnappers either
know yöu or they don't.
If they don't, then the fear of who
they're messin' with is our best asset.
Once they hear, they'll probably drop
her off at a gas station somewhere
and she's back by lunch tomorrow.
And if they know me?
They'll be in contact,
and we'll be there.
We have a top on yöur phone.
Either myself or Detective
Hansen will be here at all times.
Paul, we'll find her.
yöu better.
Why, Paul?
Why Caitlin?
- yöu didn't...?
- yöu, too?
I'm sorry.
- I just...
- If I had any idea
who did this...
just one...
yöu find her.
Do what yöu have to do.
Whatever it takes,
yöu just bring her home.
Two unidentified male classmates
were injured in that home invasion
they're expected to
make a full recovery.
Caitlin Maguire is five-six,
one hundred and five pounds,
with long brown hair and blue eyes.
If yöu have any information that
could help in the investigation
and search for Caitlin...
Move! Let's go!
Go, go, Danny, go!
- I'm gonna go out.
- Go out?
I can't just sit here,
waiting for the phone to ring, knowing
she's out there somewhere, scared.
And I'm supposed to
stay here all by myself?
There's cops all over the house.
That's not what I meant.
Please.
Be safe, okay?
Where are we off to?
Hey!
It'd be best if yöu just
stay here by the phone.
Shouldn't yöu be out somewhere
looking for my daughter?
- We're doin' everything we can.
- So am I.
Paul!
I'm so sorry,
Eleanor, please, I need
to speak with yöur son.
Wow!
yöu got all these awards.
yöu know, I started dating
Mary when I was seventeen.
That was Caitlin's mom, Mary.
yöur seventeen, right?
Yeah.
I remember once we were
on this date down by the shore...
summertime,
hot as shit, just wouldn't cool off.
Anyway, this Puerto Rican looking shithead
comes walking down the beach, and
calls Mary a slut.
yöu believe that shit?
Calling a nice, Irish, Catholic girl
like that a slut, well...
needless to say, I had
to defend her honor,
because that's what gentlemen do,
they protect women.
So I went and I got the tire iron out of the
trunk of my car and I broke both of his legs.
I'm not like that anymore.
No, I've changed,
See, 'cause when Mary got sick...
stage four breast cancer...
swore I'd go legit, so there'd
always be at least one...
one parent around to
take care of Caitlin.
They each had guns!
I would expect yöu to get SHOT...
trying to protect her.
Now, I want yöu to think hard,
what did they sound like?
What?
The kidnappers,
did they have an accent?
Did they sound Russian?
Puerto Rican?
Did they use any words? Slang?
Did they sound like greenbahs?
I... I don't know.
Wha... what did they smell like?
Spicy food, too much cologne?
Come on, Mike,
yöu have to give me something.
If anything happens to my daughter,
- I'm holding yöu personally responsible.
- I don't know, I'm sorry, I don't know!
It was all so fast, I
messed up, ya know.
I wish I coulda done something,
I wish I'd been braver.
I wish it was me, okay?
If yöu remember anything,
yöu give me a call, yöu got it?
Yes, sir.
Yeah, it's me, I need some help, will
yöu meet me at the construction site?
We're sorry,
We'll find this roach
who did this, Paulie.
yöu got my word on it.
I know yöu're still in
with O'Connell, right?
- Yep.
- Right.
yöu remember that stink that
Golden syphed not too long ago?
Did my time, kept my mouth
shut, roughed me up.
I need guys I can trust.
The cops are keeping
very close tabs on me, so...
I... I understand if yöu don't want
to get involved with this, but I...
I do need some help.
Say the word.
I want to find her.
- I want to find who took her, and...
- They're dead, Paulie.
They just don't know it yet, right?
There's two hundred thousand.
Use what yöu need to get any
information, just keep the rest, okay?
We really can't take that.
We're family.
yöu'd do the same
thing for us, Paulie.
- We'll do anything yöu ask.
- I know.
This could get dirty, so, just
how deep do yöu want this to go?
How deep is hell?
I know just where to look.
The guy's a rat but he knows me.
Just hang back and follow
my lead, all right?
Jesus, an elevator woulda been nice.
Knock, knock, asshole!
Oh, shit!
No, no, no, no!
I didn't steal anything, man!
I swear! yöu know I wouldn't
mess with yöu guys! C'mon!
Relax, relax, I know yöu wouldn't do that,
all right, yöu're too smart for that.
I got one question to
ask yöu, all right?
Who kidnapped Paul
Maguire's daughter?
Take a good look,
yöu heard anything?
Nothing! I swear!
If I knew, I would tell yöu! C’mon!
Now, who would mess
with Maguire anyway?
My, my, my.
I'm not happy with what
I see here, Oliver.
I'll bet yöu were a sweet little BL,
huh, before he got yöu all jacked-up?
Come here, honey, come here honey.
That's it, easy now.
Put her down, put her down.
- What are yöu doing?
- Come on, my Little Princess.
Am I yöur Little Princess?
I got a pretty little
Princess Necklace here for yöu, too.
yöu don't know anything about
the girl, huh, Oliver?
- Nothing, I swear!
- Start talking, Oliver!
Please! Please! Look! Whatever it is yöu
about to do... don't, please, don't, no.
Tell me about the girl, Oliver.
Please, if I knew, I would tell yöu.
C'mon, don't hurt her, c'mon, man.
Please don't, don't.
No, no! Don't Doherty!
Listen to me,
If there a girl being
held somewhere?
I don't know, I don't know! No idea!
Just tell him! I don't know!
- No, no, no, no!
- Talk to me, Oliver!
No, please! Don't!
- I love her, no, I don't know!
- What's that?
I love her, man!
No, no, no, no! Lisa, come here.
I need yöu to breathe.
Now I believe yöu.
See yöu around, Oliver
Jesus, I can't believe
I hit that rope.
What, yöu've never
done that shit before?
Hell no, I thought she was going
for a two-story swan dive.
- yöu're one harmful guy.
- Right, right, yöu're a saint, huh?
- Nobody's seen or heard anything.
- How is that possible?
Paul, we've been rattling
jaws all night long.
Whoever took her, is
keeping their shit tight.
Got feelers out everywhere.
Somewhere, someone...
has to mess-up.
Right.
Paul,
We found her.
Thank yöu for yöur beautiful soul.
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- Thank yöu for coming,
I'm so sorry, my friend,
- Vanessa, this is Francis...
- Francis O'Connell.
Hi, I 'm Vanessa, I'm Paul's wife.
- Pleased to meet yöu.
- Call me Frank.
If yöu don't mind,
Frank, I have a...
some things I'd like to
attend to at the house.
I'll see yöu later.
Can we take a walk?
yöu've done really good
for yöurself, Paulie.
I 'm proud of yöu.
Smoke and mirrors, Francis.
That's not what I heard.
yöu got a nice, big house over
there by the Country Club, eh?
And a beautiful wife.
yöu know, Paul, the
present situation aside,
yöu got yöurself one helluva life,
don't yöu agree? Huh?
Is this going somewhere?
Things have settled down,
and the business is more civilized
than it used to be.
In the good old days, yöu remember,
the gutters were running red. Huh?
yöu remember that
night at the Four Ps,
and what those Russians
faggots did to me?
Of course.
But do yöu remember what I told yöu
because yöu wanted to
rush-in and kill 'em all?
- yöu said we lost too many already.
- Exactly.
I don't know what this
has to do with anything.
My neck, it's hurtin' to
look up to yöu like this.
Do yöu mind sitting down?
That's better. Eye to eye.
That's the thing I miss
the most, I guess,
to be able to stand over
somebody and stare 'em down.
Those simple, small things in life
that I'm not able to do anymore.
yöu know, like bangin'
a yöung broad, or
kicking somebody's teeth
down their throat.
But do I lash out, Paulie?
Do I show my weakness? No.
I bury it a long time ago.
I buried the hurt.
Just like yöu have to bury yöurs.
Hey, I'm not finished! Sit down!
Um-huh.
Yeah, yöu better be listening.
Because I know yöu,
and know this unpleasantness
is eating at yöu,
and yöu're determined to
do something about it.
I'm asking yöu, don't.
Let the cops do their jobs, huh?
Things are good,
I want 'em to stay that way.
Right?
Things don't look so good
from where I am, Francis.
If yöu won't listen to reason,
can yöu listen to a friend.
I did yöu a big favor
when I let yöu walk out.
I didn't have to,
yöu know that, but I did.
I let yöu walk out.
It's not every day someone can just walk
out of the business, clean, as yöu could.
But yöu could, yöu know why?
Because yöu came to
me and yöu asked me.
I did yöu a favor and now I want
yöu to repay me by doing nothing.
Let it go away, Paulie,
bury the hurt.
yöu understand me.
Yeah.
I understand.
Does anyone want cream?
No thanks, I'm good.
yöur friend Sheila
still come around?
I don't know what we're
gonna do with all the food.
So...
Honey, do yöu mind?
I want to know.
No, really, yöu don't.
Hey.
- She's a peach, that wife of yöurs.
- So, what's the word?
No word.
O'Connell not only said to stay out of
it, but to keep an eye on yöu, too.
So what now?
I still have someone inside the Force,
someone who won't report back to yöur boss.
I do.
I can have him check into the case.
I didn't want to bring
this up, because...
we're not supposed to
bring it up, we...
No, it was a long time ago,
we did everything right.
Are yöu sure?
- Go, go, Danny, go!
- Go, go!
- Where is the key?
- Where is it?
- I ain't got it.!
- Where is it, asshole?
- No! No! No!
- Give me his gun.
Shit, no, no, no, no!
It's yöur nasty, clean it up!
No, we... we did everything right.
Jesus!
Tell me about it.
How is it that a man with this
many past criminal associations
can turn legitimate businessman and I
can't get a re-file on my mortgage?
I mean, look at this!
Irish mob, Russian mob.
Twenty suspects, no leads.
When have yöu ever known
a criminal to just go clean?
No arrest doesn't mean no activity.
Maybe he's just been careful.
No, I just talked with him
a few days ago, he's a wreck.
If he was still dirty,
he'd know who did this.
This ought to narrow-down
the suspect list.
It's the ballistics
on the Maguire girl.
A 7.62 millimeter, fired from
a Soviet made Tokarev TT-33.
Well, it gets worse.
It crossed against three hits
tied to the Chernov family.
One in 1983, and two in 1988.
What does that tell yöu?
That whoever killed her,
hadn't killed anyone
for a long, damn time.
At least not with that gun.
This stays here.
Mr. Maguire.
I'm really very sorry for yöur loss.
Caitlin was... she was
really something else.
Yes, she was.
She worked really hard on that,
and I just thought that...
Of course, I'll read it tonight.
Mr. Maguire,
Would yöu like to collect Caitlin's
belongings from her locker?
Are yöu sure it's Chernov?
No, I'm not sure.
But whoever did it
used a Russian gun.
It was 20 years ago,
how could they know about us?
How?
They took his daughter,
and yöu think that's coincidence.
Yeah, well, I never talked.
And yöu never talked.
And I'm certain Paul never talked.
So, how would anybody know?
This whole mess just stinks,
Do yöu want me to tell him?
No, I'll tell him.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Is he in?
Maybe he'll talk to yöu.
Are yöu okay?
Fine.
I know it's hard.
Just because she wasn't my blood,
doesn't mean she wasn't
my daughter, yöu know.
She loved yöu,
Thank yöu.
Stay strong.
He's upstairs.
Hey.
It was when she was four.
What have yöu heard?
- Ballistics.
- Yes?
Wanna get out of here?
So, what does that mean exactly?
How's someone like yöu get as far in yöur
organization without knowing his guns?
Knives are quiet, I like knives.
Tokarev. TT-33.
It's an old army sidearm, HL clip.
And it's favored in
the Russian mafia.
Jesus.
Yeah, the Russians.
Coulda been a hit.
It coulda been a smaller faction
just lookin' for some ransom money.
Not one of 'em takes a shit
without Chernov's permission.
We never asked permission
to rob the Russians.
We don't talk about that.
I keep trying to get Vanessa to stay
someplace safe, but she won't listen.
- She won't go.
- So, what do yöu wanna do?
Call Danny.
Like old times, fellas.
Let's do this, huh?
yöu're not understanding,
as we have a lot of money to spend
and we want to play some cards.
Clearly yöu have a problem understanding
English, we want to play cards.
- We want to play cards.
- Nyet! Private!
No, no, that is NOT what I said,
what I said is
we have a lot of money to spend
and we want to play some cards.
Okay, let us in.
Private.
Rivet?
Hey, hey, hey!
We need yöu to move, pardner!
Speak English!
I speak three languages.
How many yöu speak?
Stupid Americans?
That got their attention.
- They're gonna come gunnin' for us.
- No shit!
Always the best way to get information
when it's hard to come by.
yöu stir the pot,
they'll come lookin' for yöu.
- Just be ready.
- We're ready.
Now, Danny, this shit's about to get
radical, yöu gotta cover each other.
- Relax! All right, we got this.
- Not one of yöur cocaine parties.
Really? yöu gotta go there, Paulie?
What is it with yöu and
my partying anyway, huh?
All right, let's just relax, okay?
All right?
Jesus, Paulie.
- What is this?
- yöu know exactly what this is.
It is not safe for yöu
to be here anymore.
Tell me what happened?
Please don't shut me out,
I want to know.
What? What would yöu
really want to know? Huh?
What do yöu want to know? yöu
want to know how many people
I jacked-up last night,
how loud the screams were?
- No, I...
- Then what!?
Is it over?
It 's just beginning,
What do yöu think?
I need yöu, yöu need me.
yöu told me to do
whatever it takes, right?
Well, this is what it takes,
pack yöur bags.
Nothing was wrong, maybe I should've
kept my mouth shut.
But yöu didn't.
Now I'm in this.
I'm sorry if it upsets yöu.
Yeah, that upsets me.
My husband is a killer.
I think yöu're enjoying this.
Say, "My husband's a killer."
Come on, repeat after me,
"My husband is a killer."
yöu've always known it,
yöu just haven't seen it until now.
Huh? Is that what's going on? Is that why
yöu're still here? 'Cause it turns yöu on?
- Anything?
- Nothin'.
All right, we up the stakes.
What are yöu thinkin'?
We need a vory.
Let me make a quick call.
Beautiful.
Yeah, just take him into the back room,
keep him occupied for us, sweetheart.
We'll be right over.
Yeah, me too, easy now.
Amber's got a vory over at the Club,
she's gonna take him to
the back room for us.
Just in case the bot can.
All right, all three of us go in here,
it's gonna look suspicious as hell.
All right, so, yöu two sit tight,
and I'll go in and get this prick out.
I got this.
I shoot people in the street.
Do yöu know who I am?
- What? yöu are nothing to me.
- Hey!
Do yöu know me? Huh?
Nineteen years ago I
threw yöu from a car,
and stole yöur boss' money,
do yöu remember that?
In the mask.
Chernov thought I took the money.
He tortured me, yöu're too late.
I lost these fingers because of yöu.
Someone put a bullet
in my daughter's head,
with a Russian handgun.
Who did it?
Was that Chernov?
Someone had to have a turn?
Who was it?
Who did it?
Who did it?
No, no, no, no! Don't die.
No, no! Don't die!
Who did it? Who did it? Who did it?
Who did it? Who did it?
Who did it? Who did it?
A cup of coffee, please.
Thank yöu.
I 'm here, what do yöu want?
yöu can't go around tearing-up the
city, this isn't good for anyone.
Don't know what yöu're talkin' about.
Look, man,
this isn't gonna bring yöur kid back.
I feel yöu, what
yöu're goin' through.
But if this keeps up,
I promise yöu I'm gonna find a way to
put yöu and yöur crew away for good.
Shit, Paul!
A few years ago, my kid, Robbie,
was ridin' his bike on 6th Street,
got hit by a car.
I get to emergency and
it's touch and go.
Yeah.
The poor kid is.. is in surgery.
I felt I needed to do
something, anything.
Found out where the guy lived.
I see his fender, mangled,
where he hit my boy.
I must've stood an hour
at the edge of that driveway,
with the gun in my hand.
Then, finally I cooled myself down
and I go back to the hospital,
Robbie pulls through.
A few days later, I went
down to 6th Street,
there was construction going on,
there was a blind spot.
And I realized, in that moment,
that that accident coulda
happened to anyone.
If I had killed that man,
it wouldn't've changed a thing.
yöur kid is still alive.
Anything else?
C'mon, bitch!
yöu!
Put yöu weapon down,
on the floor now!
Down!
All right!
Andrei!
Andrei!
Andrei!
It's okay, yöu'll be dead soon.
But first...
yöu're gonna talk.
Somebody put one helluva dent
in Chernov's drug operation.
Yeah, and I haven't even started thinkin'
about the mess at the Russian joint.
Six skull cross, Chernov's men, huh?
Meet Sasha Barad.
Rap sheet as long as my dick.
Cutting-off fingers.
Somebody's trying to
sniff-out a secret.
I have a pretty good idea who.
What's is it?
Someone went into our house,
Victor and Sasha are dead
Find whoever did this.
And bring them directly to me.
What's this world comin' to, huh?
When I was a yöung man, we used to
settle our disputes with this.
Words were exchanged,
before gun shots.
People KNEW what was coming
to them... and why.
These days, they shoot first.
There's no rationale, no protocol,
nothing but blood and confusion.
How are we supposed to know
what these men want?
Oh, shit!
Hello?
There should be almost three, big bunch
of Russian guys had just gotten out.
How long will it take yöu
and Doherty to get over?
- I thought he was with yöu.
- No, man, he's not with me.
Just make it fast.
Hang-up and try...
Come on!
God damn it, Danny, take
it off, they got Kane!
Danny!
Go, go, go!
- What the hell is wrong with yöu?
- Me!? What the hell is wrong with yöu?
- Cuff him!
- Come on!
Get off him!
Get off!
Are yöu tryin' to kill everyone
in this city? Look at me!
Go to hell!
What the hell's goin' on, Maguire?
This asshole let the
kidnappers get away.
I'd like to ask yöu a few questions
concerning yöur whereabouts last night.
I'm trying to help yöu here,
yöu got clean once,
do it again.
Walk away, let us do OUR job.
We'll find who killed yöur daughter,
I promise yöu, Paul.
- It's a top priority.
- Bullshit.
I knew yöu heard about
the ballistic report.
Personally, a couple of
dead vory brightens my day.
So, why are they after yöu?
What did yöu do?
Did yöu piss someone off?
Can I go now?
Sir, are yöu serious?
- I'll take care of this.
- yöu gonna let him walk?
Thanks, Peter, I owe yöu one.
Hey, Paul.
Watch yöur back, man.
Mr. Kane, yöu know, who I am, right?
Not personally, no.
We've never met.
yöur name is Chernov,
and yöu're the bad guy.
That is quite funny,
coming from someone who's responsible
for the death of several of my men.
Can yöu offer me an explanation
for yöur behavior, please.
Explanation, I should be
asking yöu the same thing.
Anton, please,
allow me to handle this.
Maybe a little water will
help loosen yöur belt up.
Drink up.
There.
That'll not explain things.
Others don't explain.
I ask questions,
yöu answer them, understand?
That's sexy, I like that.
- I taught yöu to do that.
- Tell the stripper to leave, Danny.
- Paulie, what's up, buddy?
- Where were yöu, Danny?
Get out, grab yöur stuff, get out.
What's up?
yöu didn't check yöur phone?
I was just blowing-off a
little steam with Amber.
Why aren't yöu at yöur house?
'Cause yöu don't bang strippers in
yöur home. What's going on?
- They got Kane.
- Oh, Jesus.
And yöu didn't answer yöur phone.
I told yöu, I was havin' fun, I...
All this action, I couldn't
wind-down, I needed a release.
While yöu were gettn' high,
and getting yöur dick wet,
they got Kane.
Paulie, let me get yöu
a drink, all right?
How's the old bladder feeling?
Is it full?
Why are yöu killing my men?
Why would yöu be so stupid, huh?
What could yöu
possibly have to gain.
I can do it much longer than yöu can.
- Caitlin Maguire.
- Who?
yöu killed Caitlin Maguire, Paul
Maguire's daughter, that's the truth.
The former criminal,
who lost his daughter?
- He thinks I did it?
- He knows yöu did it.
That is a terrible accusation.
Why would I kill the little girl?
Why would I do such a thing?
She was killed with that
Russian gun, a Tokarev.
yöu're not looking so good, Mr. Kane.
I can stop if yöu like.
Why?
Revenge.
We hit the bank guard for the money.
We cut his hand off, we killed him.
We were kids.
yöu killed Ivan?
yöu killed my brother?
yöu started that war.
Call that gimp O'Connell.
When was yöur stint?
Four years ago I got out.
- And how long were yöu inside?
- What difference does it make?
Just answer the question, how long?
Five years on an eight year sentence.
Aggravated assault, possession.
Right, yeah, I remember
when it went down.
All over the papers.
A crate full of Israeli sub-machine
guns and all yöu got was possession.
- Plea bargain?
- No!
- And I don't like what yöu're gettin' at.
- What am I getting at?
- Paulie...
- No one has one clue who killed my daughter.
Not one.
Took-up all those Russians last night,
not a single one of them knew anything,
if they did, they woulda
cracked, so yöu tell me.
Paulie, I did not rat and yöu know
I wouldn't rat, it was the driver.
He didn't know shit! Never saw our
faces, never knew what hit him.
- Paulie, listen to me.
- But yöu shot him!
So, now, we'll never know.
Paulie, yöu gotta listen to me, all right?
Just listen to me.
- The whole reason I'm back with O'Connell?
- Uh-huh?
Is because I didn't
drop a dime on nobody!
I got a light rap because they
misplaced some of the evidence.
How about, still, yöu went down
nine years ago, so that was what?
What? That was two, three years
after we split the cash?
So, what are yöu getting at?
The weapons yöu got caught with, did yöu use
the money to buy them, and don't lie to me.
Yeah, of course I did. What the hell?
What's the big deal?
What's the big deal?
They took Caitlin and they shot her.
Maybe... maybe that's not a big deal to yöu,
but it's a pretty fuckin' big deal to me.
And the only reason they would do
something like that is if someone talked.
No one asked yöu, no one asked yöu where
yöu got the money for those guns.
O'Connell didn't want to know how yöu knew how yöu
could pull-off something like that on yöur own?
- Paulie!
- Yeah?
- I've always been loyal.
- yöu've always been an idiot!
Screw yöu, Paulie!
Nothing's ever yöur fault.
There's always someone else to blame,
always someone there
to bail yöu out.
Who... who's bailing yöu out now?
Who's man are yöu now?
Are yöu my man?
Are yöu Chernov's man?
- Are yöu O'Connell's man?
- Take it easy, Paulie! Easy!
- Knock it off!
- yöu talked!!!!!
I didn't talk!
Someone got to yöur boss.
- They take care of yöu, make those guns go away.
- That's not what...
O'Connell talked,
and now my daughter's dead!
We swore not to talk about it,
not to spend the money,
not to draw attention to ourselves!
- I'm not a rat!
- yöu are a rat!
- Rat! Rat! Rat!
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
yöu... yöu swore it!
Paulie, shit, man!
I loved yöu, and yöu swore.
Danny, come on, Danny.
Danny.
yöu got to get up, Man.
Get up, Danny!
Danny.
I 'm with yöu, bro.
What is so damned important yöu had to pull
me away from my nephew's football game?
Anton.
I believe that belongs to yöu.
No, hasn't been mine
for many, many years.
- I have no responsibility.
- Responsibility, huh?
When I was nineteen years old,
I was the number one,
light heavyweight champion in the Soviet
Olympic Boxing Team, did yöu know this?
No, I don't like sports.
And especially not Soviet Sports.
I had a shot at number one.
I could have been the champion, except
my father had a little problem.
He was a pathetic gambler,
and he could no longer pay his debt.
The Russian Mob, the Brita,
placed the burden on my shoulders.
I could clear his debt by taking a
fall by losing to the champion.
What do yöu think I did?
- I don't know, I don't have a clue, fill me in.
- Doesn't have a clue.
I took a beating for my father,
I lost for him.
No child should have to pay
for their father's sins.
But the Bratwa took me in,
gave me new life.
When my father fell
for the debt again,
who do yöu think they
sent to collect?
Me.
My father failed, just as
yöur man here failed yöu.
I told yöu he's not mine any longer,
are yöu deaf?
yöu know the Maguire fellow,
the one in the news?
The one whose daughter'd
been killed, huh?
What about him?
He was the one who
killed my brother.
He was the one who started
the war between us.
The one who landed
yöu in that chair.
So yöu see...
I invited yöu here to ask
yöu to do one thing for me.
Take responsibility.
Let me make one thing clear,
I don't take orders
from people like yöu.
Russian scumbag!
Do what yöu have to do.
Whatever it takes.
Tokarev,
TT-33.
It's an old army sidearm.
It's a favorite of the Russian Mafia.
No, no, do not!
Evan!
Evan!
What was so important?
I'm sorry, Mike.
What?
Sorry.
It was an accident...
No! Please!
I didn't mean to! C'mon, yöu have to
believe me! No, no, please, please no.
Okay,
We... we... we were hanging out,
and drinking, as normal,
and... and... and talking about...
about how yöu used to be a gangster.
So, where does he
keep the loot, huh?
Shut up!
C'mon, how many times do I have
to tell yöu guys, my dad is a...
A legitimate businessman.
Yes.
Yeah, has he ever been arrested?
Maybe yöu should ask
him when he gets home.
No... Honestly, he kinda
scares the shit outta me.
Pussy.
Have yöu ever seen
or heard anything?
Like secret phone calls
or wads of cash lying around?
- Wait, did yöu see that?
- Totally.
- Did yöu see that?
- Come on, yöu know something,
something cool.
Come on, spill it.
Caitlin, please...
All right.
Serious?
Yeah, yeah, I'll show yöu something.
Yes...
We went upstairs, she... she said
she had something cool to show us.
I'd never held a gun
before, yöu know.
It... it... it was
scary and cool and,
I know I shoulda put it down.
But I didn't.
Take some of this, yöu assholes!
Evan, come on,
don't make me chase yöu!
- Come on, let's go!
- It's raining.
So what, it's rain.
Are yöu gonna melt?
All right, come on, Evan,
we gotta put it back.
- No! It's not even loaded!
- Don't be an asshole, c'mon.
- Give it over.
- Fine, buzzkill, jeez.
Jesus, yöu, too?
All right, hand it over.
Oh God! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Is she dead?
No!
I didn't hear her coming.
I wasn't paying attention,
I was a little drunk, and... and...
and the gun was so cool, yöu know.
And it felt...
I didn't know she was
gonna be right behind me!
I...
It was an accident.
I didn't know what to do.
We dragged her into the woods.
We put the guns back,
we trashed the house to make
it seem like a home invasion.
I figured... with yöur history,
the cops would think it was
a mob hit or something.
I'm so sorry,
I didn't want to kill her.
I was scared. I was scared!
I loved her,
I swear to God, I loved her so much.
Please say something!
Just end this.
Please.
I can't take it anymore.
Please.
Hey, baby.
Hi.
It's okay now.
It's all over.
It's good to hear yöur voice.
Come home, know yöu'll be safe now,
Are yöu okay? yöu sound so...
I killed a man,
when I was seventeen.
Caitlin's age.
I got into a fight.
Someone handed me a knife.
Sometimes I dream about that night.
In the dream I see myself,
and I try to stop it, but I can't.
Then I wake up,
and I wonder what
would have happened,
if no one handed me that knife.
What my life,
what our lives,
might have been.
Paul.
I'm sorry I let yöu down.
Paul?
Paul!
Yeah!
