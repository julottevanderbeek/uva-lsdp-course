"I'm really not
the head of the family...
how should I answer
that question?
Well, if you
don't consider yourself
head of the household...
Are you sure?
I'm positive. No one
will know about that.
We won't know you from
Adam's house cat.
Talk about pollution.
But no, I got ahold of this first,
before she did...
and I thought,
"Well, I'll answer it."
But I wanted to be honest,
and I'm a man of conscience...
Hey!
- All right.
Thank you so much.
It's nice talking to you.
You're welcome.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Ted Mack Original
Amateur Hour.
Huh.
That's sick, man.
Yes, sir. Whatever
you want, I got it.
What do you want?
Fill it with Ethyl.
If Ethel don't mind.
Want me to check
under the hood for you?
Uh, please. Yes.
Looks like you could use
a new radiator hose.
Where have I
heard that before?
I'll get one later.
- You're the boss.
- Not in my house, I'm not.
Attendant?
Yes, sir?
You got change
for the telephone?
Yes, sir.
I'll get you the rest later?
Be with you in a minute.
Operator, I'd like to call
Uh, Dave Mann.
The number here is 238-2098.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Honey? Uh, it's me.
What's the matter?
Did you have an accident?
No, nothing like that.
Well, what happened?
Well, nothing
happened. I just, uh...
uh, well, l...
I just wanted to,
uh, to apologize.
You don't have to
apologize, Dave.
I know. I wanted to.
When I left the house
this morning,
you were asleep...
so I just wanted
to call you up and
tell you that, uh...
I, uh... I'm sorry
about last night.
I don't really
want to talk about it.
Well...
don't you think
maybe we ought to?
No, because if we
talk about it...
we'll fight, and you wouldn't
want that, would you?
Of course not.
What is that
supposed to mean?
- Oh, never mind.
- Uh, just a minute.
I know what it's
supposed to mean.
It means you think
I should go out and call
Steve Henderson up...
and challenge him to
a fistfight or something.
No, of course not.
But you could have at least
said something to the man.
I mean, after all, he...
Practically tried to rape me
in front of the whole party.
- Oh, come on, honey.
- Just forget it.
- You gonna be home by 6:30?
- If Forbes lets me go in time.
- Is it that important
that you see him?
- Huh.
He's leaving for Hawaii
in the morning.
The way he's been griping
to the front office,
if I don't reach him today...
- I could lose the account.
- You said there'd be no problem
getting home on time.
There probably won't be.
It's your mother.
God knows she's not
coming to see me.
Honey, I said there
probably won't be
a problem.
Well, just be on time, okay?
All right.
Okay, I'll be there.
Here's your card, sir.
Be with you
in a second.
- Save them stamps?
- No, thanks.
Good enough.
Come back, now.
Will do.
I gave you the road.
Why don't you take it?
Why don't you go?
Oh, boy, you're beautiful.
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
I'm in no mood to play games.
Let's go.
Well, it's about time, Charlie!
My God.
Jesus.
Come on, you miserable fathead.
Get that fat-ass truck out of my way.
Well, I'm never going to
make that appointment now.
You miserable...
Okay. Okay.
You want to play games?
Uhh!
Yeah. Yeah, except...
Oh, my neck.
You got a whiplash,
probably.
Yeah. It's all right.
He's all right.
What happened?
That truck driver
tried to kill me.
Kill you? Go on!
He chased me
down the mountain at...
at nearly 90 miles an hour,
and I don't...
don't know what else
you'd call it.
Tried to kill you.
It sure looks like you got
whiplash, all right.
Oh, it's... it's, uh...
You got the whiplash,
all right.
Oh, that's okay.
Thank... It's okay.
Anything I can do for you?
No, nothing. Thank you.
That's okay.
Okay.
Just a little whiplash is all.
Can I use your
men's room, please?
Yeah. Through the door...
on the right,
down the hall...
turn left, second door.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
What happened out there?
Oh, just a slight
complication.
Oh? Looked like a big
complication to me.
- Well, you ready to order now?
Ahem. Yes. Heh heh.
Yes, thank you. Um...
Oh, I think I'll...
Ahh.
Just give me, um... um...
Why don't you just give me
a Swiss cheese sandwich...
- on rye. R-Y-E.
- Swiss cheese on rye.
- All right.
- And could I have another
glass of water, please?
- Oh, sure.
Another glass of water.
- Oh, uh, miss?
- Do you have an aspirin?
- Aw, your head aches.
Sure, I'll get you some aspirin.
There you are.
Anything else?
No, thank you.
Uh...
I'd like some ketchup.
Look, uh...
heh heh...
- I want you to cut it out.
- What?
Just-Just cut it out, okay?
- Cut what out?
- Now, come on. I mean...
please, l - l...
Let's not play games.
- What the hell are you
talking about?
- I can call the police.
- The police?
- You think that I won't?
You're wrong, mister.
If you think you can
take that truck of yours...
and use it as a murder weapon,
killing people on the highway,
well, you're wrong.
Man, you need help.
Don't you tell me
I need help.
Hey! Hey, hey, come on!
Who the hell
do you think you are...
- knockin' my sandwich
outta my hand?
- You wanna fight, get outside.
- You already hit him twice.
That creep goes around,
knocks my sandwich outta my hand.
I'll buy you
another sandwich.
Come on, forget it.
No, forget it.
- Forget it.
- I don't wanna stay
around here anyway.
Let me buy you
a beer then, huh?
I'll buy you a beer.
Get out of here, huh?
Yeah?
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I could use help.
What kind of help?
I could use a push.
Damn thing overheated.
Now I can't get her
started again.
Why didn't you flag down
that truck?
What truck?
The one that just
went by here.
I didn't notice.
I must have been inside
tryin' to get that
piece of junk shakin'.
Would you get off
the car?
How about it?
Looks like I'd go
right underneath the bumper.
No.
Hey, get off the car.
You're gonna get hurt there.
Naw, you're all right.
Rodney, get down
from there.
Wait a minute!
Wait, l...
Well, we'll see.
Come on. Come on.
Push! Push! Push!
Push! Push! Push! Push!
He can't do it!
You can't do it!
You can't do it!
You can't do it!
You can't do it!
