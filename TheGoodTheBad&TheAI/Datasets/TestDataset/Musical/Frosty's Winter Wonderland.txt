Pass the snow tire.
He's not going to come to life.
Of course not.
He's not Frosty the Snowman.
Only the real Frosty can come to life.
I wish he'd come back
from the North Pole.
Yeah, it's not warm here anymore.
He wouldn't melt.
He said he'd come back again someday.
I wonder if he really meant it.
Well, certainly he meant it.
You all remember that day Frosty left.
I sure do miss all those boys and girls.
I've been up here such a long time.
I told them I'd be back again someday.
But when will someday come?
"City A Winter Wonderland."
"First Snow Of Season."
Hey, someday is today.
So, Frosty sat down
and wrote a letter to all his old friends.
Frosty's coming back!
And when the kids realized
that Frosty was coming back...
it really was a Winter Wonderland.
It was wonderful for many reasons.
But most of all...
because Frosty
wasn't going to be lonely anymore.
See, he had a very special surprise
in store for him.
You've heard the old familiar tale,
how Frosty came to life.
But do you know the story...
of how Frosty took a wife?
You know, when you're a kid...
winter is one of the four best seasons
of the year.
But when you're a snowman,
winter is the only season of the year.
Watch, here comes one now.
With Frosty here,
the sound of winter laughter...
was soon ringing through the meadow.
But there was one person
who got very jealous.
Jack Frost, that icy artist
who paints the world white every winter.
Why is that snowman
getting all the credit?
Why don't the children love me?
I'm the one who makes winter wonderful.
Frosty was still
the fastest belly-whopper in the world.
We're winning.
I'll show him.
Hello.
Did you make that neat wind
all by yourself?
Why, of course, I did. I'm Jack Frost.
I'm wonderful.
Why, I can do anything wintry.
Blow winds, freeze ponds,
make blizzards so deep...
they'll close down all the schools.
Boy, he's just a big bragger.
Yeah. Frosty's lots more fun.
- Come on, Frosty, let's go.
- Hop aboard.
Yeah, winter's no fun without Frosty.
Frosty. That's all I hear.
A stupid snowman takes my place...
just because he has that silly magic hat
that brought him to life.
That hat, yes.
I'll eliminate the hat and that will be that.
they all went for a sleigh ride
out to the skating park.
But, Frosty, there are two horses.
I could never count.
When it came to skating,
Frosty was the tops.
- Can you make a figure eight, Frosty?
- I can try.
You're right, Frosty. You can't count.
Now, if I could just aim my north wind...
at that magic hat.
Get behind me, quick.
Got it!
Frosty's magic silk hat!
It's mine! It's mine!
There was so much snow
blowing around...
that Jack Frost didn't see
that he had the wrong hat.
Ignore me, will they?
Now those children
won't have any winter friends.
And wearing a horse's hat, he took off
for other, faraway wintry places.
And as for the kids,
the next day they began to notice...
something different
about their friend Frosty.
- Suppertime, Frosty. Mom wants us home.
- Yup.
- Good night, Frosty. See you tomorrow.
- Yup.
What's the matter, Frosty?
"Yup. Yup." Doesn't sound like you.
It's just that every night
when you go home and leave me...
I miss you something awful.
- Yes, but you can't come indoors with us.
- You'd melt, Frosty.
I know.
But when you're all together inside...
and I'm all alone outside...
Poor Frosty.
Do you know what you need, Frosty?
A wife.
- What's a wife?
- A Mrs. Frosty, you know?
Someone you think is very beautiful,
who thinks you're very handsome...
and will love you back when you love her.
What a great invention.
So the next morning they began to build
a beautiful snow-wife...
designed to Frosty's
very own specifications.
Kind of round and plump...
with the top of her head
coming just above here.
There.
They were just plastic,
but they sparkled like sapphires.
And her mouth was made
from some of Mom's pink yarn.
And an old dust mop became a coiffure.
That's a hairdo, you know.
She's beautiful. What's her name?
- Cleopatra?
- Nah.
- Emantrude?
- Nah.
- Minnehaha?
- Nah.
Cornflakes?
Cornflakes?
How about... Crystal?
Yeah!
- Crystal.
- That's great.
Hello, Crystal.
Only one thing.
She's not all living like I am.
Not that it's important, but it's important.
- Maybe a hat would bring her to life.
- A lady's hat.
Yap says we can use hers.
There must have been some magic
in that pretty hat they found...
Nothing.
It was a nice idea anyway.
Yeah, things were pretty sad for Frosty.
And to make matters worse,
miles and miles away...
in another part of winter,
Jack Frost sat down to rest for a minute...
and for the first time
he got a good look at that hat.
This isn't the magic hat.
This is a horse's hat.
Somebody's been horsing around
with Jack Frost.
Now, who did it? It's him.
That frosted snowman did it.
I'll show them, though,
that nobody makes a fool of Jack Frost.
When I get through...
there'll be no more Frosty the Snowman.
Poor Frosty,
he didn't know about Jack Frost's plans.
And even if he had known,
he wouldn't have cared...
for all his thoughts were about
his beloved, still silent, Crystal.
Crystal, I don't care if you're not all living.
and brought up
a lovely bouquet of frost flowers...
And suddenly,
as the wintry stars twinkled down...
those simple flowers,
worked an icy miracle.
Happy birthday.
Crystal, I've been waiting all day.
- What kept you?
- Frosty.
I thought you'd never think
of those flowers.
There never were
two happier snow-people.
Hey, everybody.
We're gonna have a wedding.
Oh, Frosty. What's he done to you?
No more Frosty.
No more Frosty?
That's ridiculous. You have a wife...
except for the formalities, that is,
to help you now.
There.
Everyone knows the groom
should have a flower in his buttonhole.
That's just to say, "I love you, Frosty."
Happy birthday.
What?
That's impossible. Isn't it?
Wait. Come back here.
You darn snowpersons!
Drat. I've been outfrosted again.
Hey, everybody, it's time for that wedding.
- A wedding.
- We're gonna need a preacher. Come on.
They were going to hold the wedding
that very night.
Finally Parson Brown showed up,
but when he saw Frosty and Crystal...
Dear me.
I didn't know you were snowpersons.
I'm only allowed to marry real persons.
It just wouldn't be legal if I tied this knot.
- Doggone.
- Oh, dear.
Seems to me that the right parson...
to marry a snowman to a snowwoman
would be a snow-parson.
I'll help you build him.
There was the nicest snow-parson
you ever did see.
A parson's not a parson,
till he holds the Good Book in his hand.
- Happy birthday.
- Hooray.
A wedding.
Now the competition will be double.
No. I won't allow it.
I will not allow it.
I am the most powerful thing in winter.
There's cold wind nipping at my nose.
You must be him.
Jack Frost.
Finally I'm getting some attention.
Attention?
Why, you're the most
important person here.
- We couldn't even begin without you.
- What?
It was so good of you
to come to our wedding.
It's about to start, you know.
What are you talking about?
If you'd turn that wind down a bit,
it would be a lot easier to be heard.
All right, but just for a minute.
What a neat idea.
- What are you whispering about?
- Tell him.
The bride's made of winter...
and the groom's made of winter...
and the parson's made of winter...
the whole wedding party should be wintry.
And so...
Would you be the best man?
What? Me?
Best man. Could you?
What do you mean, could I?
- I've always been the best man.
- Thank you, little friend.
- Friend?
- You've made us very happy.
Hey, everybody!
Happy birthday.
And so the wedding commenced.
A heaven of diamonds shine down
through the night.
I now pronounce you snowman and wife.
And they lived happily ever after.
Through January, February...
March, and way into April.
This was the year
winter almost didn't end.
When the thermometer gets all reddish,
it's time for us to go.
Wait, friends. I can fix that.
Winter never has to end.
With me around,
this fun can go on forever.
And it did. It went on and on,
till some folks started to get worried.
It was up to Parson Brown
to set those winter friends straight.
Winter never end?
That might be fun for you,
but what about all the trees...
with new green leaves inside them
just busting to be born?
And what about the seeds
and the bulbs deep in the ground?
Nature made them a promise,
that someday they'd be pretty flowers.
Can you imagine how you'd feel...
if someone broke such a promise to you?
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.
I like the flowers...
even though
I never get a chance to see them.
He's right, Frosty. Parson Brown is right.
It's time for us to go.
We'll miss you all so much.
We'll be back, you'll see.
Now, come on. No time for long faces.
Stop.
It's you again.
The talking snowman.
You don't surprise me anymore.
Good, and I'd like you to meet Crystal.
Hello. I'm Frosty's snow-wife.
And it is my pleasure, Crystal.
Now, isn't that nice? A snow-wife.
A snow-wife!
Bye.
And when Jack Frost also left
for the North Pole...
the gentle warmth of springtime
erased his magic work for another year.
And soon the Winter Wonderland
was only a memory.
But it was a good memory,
and good memories can never die.
Because we all know
that on one not-so-far-away day...
that first snowflake will fall.
Then...
May all your winters be wonderful.
And frosty, too.
