Hello, you're one of the five.
Please hold.
Hello, you're one of the five.
Please hold.
Hello, you're one of the five.
Please hold.
I got through!
Max, I got through!
We need to talk, Grace.
I better sit down. I don't want to drop
the phone and lose the connection.
Are you okay?
You look kind of pale.
I'm not sick.
We have to talk, Grace.
But I'm just on hold
for these tickets.
There's only five
and I'm one.
It's Victor Fox.
It's for the Special.
For his taping here in Chicago.
It's ''The Lark from Lark''!
We need to discuss
our marriage.
Our
Our marriage?
Is it
Is it terrible?
Should I
Should I be afraid?
I ... I don't want
to be married anymore.
Hello, thanks for waiting.
Congratulations.
Can I take your name
and address?
You don't want
to be married anymore?
You don't want
to be married to me...
...or you don't want
to be married?
Hello?
I found
an apartment downtown.
The name and address
are here on this memo.
I've also included my attorney's
name and number.
You should call him so that he can
explain my payments to you.
I put down the name
of a very good counselor.
You should call her.
She's expecting you to call.
I've been seeing her
myself for the past year.
She's been very helpful.
You've been
You've been seeing a counselor?
We should Shouldn't we have been
doing that together?
- No.
- To discuss our problems?
You were the problem.
I'm
I'm sorry.
I didn't
I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean
to say that.
How was I
the problem?
Max how was I
the problem?
Mortality.
One day,
I'm gonna die.
This morning I saw a window-washer
on the other building here.
He has one of the most
dangerous jobs imaginable...
and yet, what a view.
I'm not young anymore.
I have to start small
with the dangerous things.
I have to leave you, Grace.
And I know I will feel terrible
when I walk out that door,
but I also know I will feel
more alive than I do right now.
I never said that.
Am I late?
I'm sorry if I am.
I had to drop
Pokey off at day care.
Yes, day care!
I needed the rest.
He cries all night.
I am sleep-deprived,
- and it's your fault.
- My fault?
You rocked Andrew to sleep every night
when he was a baby.
He rocked Pokey
to sleep every night.
He left us and I can't rock Pokey
the same way he did.
Bastard!
He was making Pokey rely on him.
Why did you let us get married?
We weren't compatible.
Andrew always told me
you were very compatible.
Sexually, that's it.
As soon as the baby came into it,
we were finished.
It's this generation of men.
They think they never have to grow up.
Excuse
They never see me.
They never
stop seeing me.
Over here!
Hey!
Now Max, his generation accepted
what it meant to be grown up.
How long have you two
been married?
And you still
love each other.
Whatever.
Passion isn't everything. I prove that.
The chicken salad,
dressing on the side and a latte.
- Me too.
- You too, what?
Please?
''Me too'' what? What does that mean?
The latte? The salad?
Excuse me.
Hey!
Look at me!
Is this rudeness deliberate
or are you just lacking social skills?
- I beg your pardon?
- ''I beg your pardon?''
Now she's ''Miss Manners.''
Are you picking on my mother-in-law.
Because she's a housewife
who reminds you
of your own mother,
who you probably despise?
Or is it that my being a dwarf
makes you so uncomfortable,
but you know you'll be fired
if you aren't polite to a dwarf?
I'll be right back
with your order.
Why don't you take a picture?
It lasts longer.
You're right.
It's all my fault.
Andrew left you because he was afraid
of being a father.
He was always
a fearful little boy.
I'd say to him,
''It's all right, darling.
There's nothing
to be afraid of.''
But he never believed me.
Because I didn't believe me.
But there's so much
to be afraid of.
There's war and murder.
Diseases...
pollution and loneliness...
And Max left me
Most of those things
aren't your fault.
What?
Did you just say
Max left you?
Why?
You piece of shit!
He said he needed
to do ''dangerous things''
To feel alive again.
Maybe it's the same
for me, too.
Maybe... Maybe I need to do
something dangerous.
I mean, if you knew me,
you'd be quite surprised
that I'm calling you like this.
I mean, if you knew me
If you knew me...
you'd know that this is
a very dangerous thing for me to do.
Because you could say no...
or you could humiliate
me in some way.
But at least I've had
the courage to call.
lsn't there
one more ticket?
Well you see,
you hung up.
That disqualified you.
I'm sorry.
Please. You don't know how important
it is for me to see Victor Fox.
See, that ticket
was more than a ticket to me.
It was a tiny,
shining piece of hope.
Listen, I can't
promise you anything
but...
Here, give me your name
and address just in case.
Uh...
Grace...
Beasley.
Apartment 2809,
Chicago.
Okay, Grace.
I have to hang up now.
Okay.
Oh!
- Hello?
- Mrs. Beasley?
- Yes.
- This is Nurse Mills.
Please hold for your
daughter-in-law.
- Grace?
- Maudey, what's wrong?
I'm in the hospital.
I had a panic attack while I was dropping
Pokey at day care.
Not a heart attack,
a panic attack.
I just thought
it was a heart attack.
They said I have to learn
to deal with my stress.
To learn to deal with the fact that
relationships don't last.
l
Maudey, where's Pokey?
- Morning, Mrs. Beasley.
- Morning, Keith.
- Business or pleasure?
- Pardon me?
Today's exciting adventure.
I'm going to pick up
my grandson.
Great. Oh, Mrs. Beasley.
You've heard the warning?
What warning?
It's more advice really.
Just don't get out of your car.
What? When?
You know, when you're
underneath the city.
Especially don't stop
and talk to the homeless.
Why? What have they
been doing?
I don't want
to worry you, okay?
But keep your windows
rolled up, all right?
All right?
Sad Victor?
Oh no. Not now.
You're here, Pokey.
Romantic Victor?
When you're older.
''Victor Sings Dusty!''
Oh!
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's just fireworks.
Oh, isn't it beautiful?
It's a sign, Pokey.
They'll find an extra ticket,
and Victor will sing to me,
and Max will see me
on television
and he'll
come back to me.
Then your mama
will feel better
and she'll
come back to you.
We will all be healed.
It's a sign.
Andrew!
Sorry, ma.
I didn't want to wake you.
I just left you a note to tell you
that I picked up Pokey.
Where are you going
to take him at this hour?
His day care center
opens at 5:00.
Please, darling,
leave Pokey with me.
Just until Maudey feels
better able to cope.
It's not a good idea
right now.
I'm his grandmother.
I just don't want
anything bad
to happen to him.
And it's
it's safe at day care.
Well yes, but...
there's more to life
than being safe.
The ticket will come.
The ticket will come.
The ticket will come.
Who is it?
It's Keith, Mrs. Beasley.
I've got a delivery for you.
Oh thank you!
Yes!
They're placing the stool.
The champagne.
Dom Perignon '67.
Or Cristal '92.
If they can't
find the Dom.
He once drank
Moet in Guam.
Well Guam.
ln a Waterford Crystal flute.
She's right.
Do you ever have
''Victor dreams''?
Er...
She does.
Yes we can.
The union doesn't care...
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention please?
Due to circumstances
beyond our control,
Victor Fox
has been delayed.
And we have no choice
but to reschedule
the taping
of today's show.
We're very, very sorry.
Please accept our apologies.
We do plan to tape
the show at a later date.
Keep your tickets and check
the newspapers for information...
I need some help here.
Ma'am?
I hope we crash and die.
Grace, don't say
things like that to me.
I'm supposed to think happy thoughts.
I'm a good mom.
I'm a good mom.
I'm a good mom.
- What am I gonna do without him?
- You'll survive.
Sure you lived with him for 25 years,
but you'll survive.
- Lived with who?
- Max.
Not Max.
Victor Fox.
He was murdered
by the Crossbow Killer.
You're kidding me.
What are you, crazy?
Wow, what a turnout.
Come on, let's go.
Move!
- All right, all right.
- Keep moving. Let's go.
Look at these idiots.
Move!
Let's check out
the flowers and stuff.
Pay homage.
Come on, Grace.
The keyword here is ''closure.''
Excuse me.
Get out of my way.
Move.
Coming through.
- I'm sorry.
- Out of my way. Handicapped.
Grace!
Grace?
Oh my God.
Let's get you a drink.
Watch your step.
There's a bar.
Come on, move.
Let's go.
And now for an update
on the Victor Fox story...
Calm down.
Take deep breaths.
What a shithole.
...we go live to the underground
where Kate Cummings is on the scene.
- What can you tell us?
- Thanks, Kelly...
Why are there
flowers here, too?
Victor was here minutes
before he was murdered.
I served him myself.
Which table
was he seated at?
Oh, he was
He was right here at the bar.
Dressed in a glittering suit.
What was he drinking?
Guinness.
Then I want to sit here at the bar
where he sat
and drink what he drank.
Me too.
It's premature to say
anything at this point.
This is the mug
he drank from.
A crossbow?
Sell it to you for $1 5.
Come on, 1 5 bucks?
He's probably sold
a hundred of them already.
I want it.
Victor Fox met the arrow
of a madman.
He was a real nice guy.
But he said the beer
in England tastes better.
Something about preservatives.
Then he said, ''A life lived in fear
isn't much fun.''
What did you say?
He said, ''A life lived
in fear isn't much fun.''
Then he left.
Let that set a minute.
People won't
say it out loud,
but we'll all be blamed.
Chicago will be the city
that killed Victor Fox.
How can any of us
ever be the same?
I'm going to his funeral.
It'll be in England.
Well, then I'm going
to England.
Why?
What did you call it?
''Closure.''
Can't you close here?
You've got the mug.
The funeral won't be
for a few days.
I'll leave tonight.
What do you mean
you'll leave tonight?
Grace!
Grace!
Hey, Grace!
You are not going
to England.
You've been through
a trauma.
Two traumas.
Here, breathe
into my bag.
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I
I'm sorry.
I sing when
I'm nervous.
That's all right.
You have a lovely voice.
Oh, thank you.
When I was a girl
I dreamed of becoming a singer.
lsn't that silly?
Not at all.
I had exactly the same dream.
Why doesn't the captain
say something?
We need to be reassured.
Actually, I enjoy
a bit of turbulence.
Reminds me
that I'm flying.
Oh!
On the other hand...
enough is enough.
And I'd like the card
to say this.
''Never regret, never forget.''
Oh, I'm really sorry.
I think someone else
has used this poem.
Let me check my book.
Yes, I'm afraid so.
Well...
I have an idea.
Maybe the person
who wrote the poem
would let me pay half the cost
of their wreath.
Do you have their
telephone number?
Could we call and ask?
It's not really done.
Well,
these are tragic times.
The rules change
during tragic times.
That's true.
Let me call.
Hello? I'm calling
from Lark Floral Arrangements.
No, no problem.
Yes, yes they accepted
the credit card.
No, there's a woman here
who wants to pay for half your wreath.
Well...
I'm not sure why.
- May I speak to them?
- She wants to speak to you.
Hello.
An American.
I might have guessed.
Why can't you buy
your own wreath?
It isn't the wreath
so much as what you wrote.
Did you write the obituary
in the paper, too?
Mmm-hmm.
Well, it affected me
very deeply.
You see, I had forgotten
about unconditional love.
I just clear forgotten.
And And when I read
your poem I realized
that that's what I felt
for Victor Fox, and
and for my children...
and my husband
once.
Um...
I don't know you so this
is going to sound strange
but it wasn't until
I read your poem
that I realized
why I was here.
Here in Lark,
I mean.
I came on impulse
as if there was something
that I had to do or to know
and I think you're part of it.
It would be my honor to share
my wreath with you.
It would?
Yes, because you're
completely crazy.
Not half crazy
but completely.
And that's in the spirit
of Victor's death,
crazy and pointless.
l...
Just write...
''Love, Grace.''
You wouldn't want to get involved
with somebody like him.
I don't know why
Mr. Fox put up with him.
He knew Victor Fox?
He lived with him.
He was...
...the valet.
What do you want,
''Grandma''?
Are you ''D.S.''?
- Who?
- D.S.
Oh, you mean Dirk.
Dirk Simpson.
- I guess.
- Who are you?
You his mum
or something?
I'm a mom.
He says you're dead.
Tell Dirk
I was dead,
but now, I'm alive.
You are not my mother.
You were Victor Fox's valet,
weren't you?
Victor Fox's valet?
Of course, that's who I am.
I'm a valet.
I dressed him in the morning
and I washed his smalls, didn't l?
And parked his car.
''Parked his car''?
Not in this country, sweetie.
Victor didn't have a car
we went everywhere in limos.
I don't understand
You're just one of those frumps without a
life who fixated on Victor,
and now leave stinky, scrawny flowers
all over my front path,
telephone me
with bizarre revelations
concerning their pointless,
wretched lives,
send me pictures of their
fat middle-aged selves
and otherwise push me
to another level of hell!
Get off my property, American frump,
before I call the police.
This isn't your property.
You're you're
You're a
You're a squatter!
A squatter?
Victor Fox left me this house,
this land and all
his worldly possessions.
I don't believe you.
You're a liar.
- Frump without a life.
- Valet without a car.
Life without a point!
Psst!
Come here.
Come here!
Get down.
Get down.
- Are you a friend of Dirk's?
- Certainly not.
I can't imagine that rude young man
has any friends.
He has several of them,
and they've all taken up residence
in Victor Fox's family cottage
Three by our estimate
like a nest of rats.
Are you a friend of Victor's?
I cared about him very much.
Please forgive me.
I'm Nola Fox Worthington.
- Victor's sister.
- Victor's sister?
One of them.
There are three sisters.
Down! Get down!
This is Lynette Fox-Moore
and her husband,
Barry Moore.
- Good afternoon.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
- Shh!
Come on.
And this
is Harriet Fox-Furrier.
She's traveled all the way
from South Africa.
Hello.
I'm the baby.
Grace Beasley.
Would you like
a cup of tea, Grace?
Oh, that would be lovely.
Here, come with us.
We've got our Bentley.
Look at this place.
I let pigs live in my house!
Pigs?
...have to do
everything myself ow!
Victor...
you idiot.
Picnic.
Victor with horse.
Look, all padded up.
- He was a dear little boy.
- So good-looking.
Was he
Was he always artistic?
What do you mean,
''artistic?''
- Talented.
- Yes, he was always talented.
- And normal.
- Normal.
He played rugby,
soccer, cricket.
He hated sports, though.
He preferred dancing.
Ballroom dancing, yes.
He did that
to meet girls.
Girls, girls, girls.
What a ladykiller.
Oh my goodness.
We were
We were very close.
Close as any brother
and sister could be.
Yes, so close he tried to suffocate
her when she was two.
Healthy sibling rivalry.
- Like in any normal, healthy family.
- Normal.
We grew up
in this cottage,
with our loving
mother and father.
Yes, we had
our ups and downs.
Flirtations
with psychiatric situations.
Domestic violence.
Drug abuse.
- Like any normal, healthy family.
- Normal.
I can't stand the injustice
of that low life
living in our home.
So there's no truth
in what he said?
What did he say?
Oh, he
He said that
That Victor left
the house to him.
Preposterous.
There isn't even a will.
Why would Victor leave a house worth
a million pounds to the help?
He's the worst kind
of employee.
How would you feel, Grace,
if an employee of yours
moved into your home
after you died
and pretended to have
been involved
in a perverted
relationship with you?
- I don't have any employees.
- If you did?
What kind of
What kind of perverted
relationship?
Don't think about it, Nola.
He says that Victor
and he were lovers
for over 10 years.
- Lovers?
- Yes.
You mean...
Victor was
- Yes.
- No!
No, no.
Victor Fox, the idol
of millions of women
all over the world,
a nancy-boy?
Nancy-boy.
We want to turn the house
into a tribute museum.
A memorial
to the true Victor.
The Victor
as we remember him.
The ''Graceland'' for Lark.
How do you manage?
Manage?
Your busy life.
Your career without any employees.
Well, I do it all myself.
Well... what is it
you do, exactly?
Well...
- I'm a homemaker.
- A what?
A homemaker?
But don't doesn't that
I mean
You mean
you're a housewife?
We thought you were
a record company executive.
Something to do with
the entertainment industry.
- Why would you think that?
- You're American.
So what's your connection
with Victor?
Well, I never knew
Victor, but...
I loved him
all the same.
Oh.
I've been having tea
with a fan?
Get her out of here, Barry.
- Let her finish her tea at least.
- Bill.
How much more can I
be expected to endure?
I've been pouring out all my private pain
to an autograph dog.
- Hound.
- And now they're playing Victor's music.
How tasteless.
That's not Victor.
That's Tom Jones.
I should know my own brother's
voice when I hear it.
Tom's very good,
but he'll never be Victor.
Are you telling me I don't know
my own brother's voice?
That's my brother's voice!
Actually, it's Tom Jones.
I put the CD on myself.
You slut.
- Grace.
- Please let me apologize.
I don't know why I accepted
Nola's invitation for tea.
I guess
I was just curious.
I mean, you being
Victor's family
Please, let me apologize.
Nola's very upset.
Well of course.
Her brother being killed so horribly.
Well, truth be known,
they were estranged for 20 years.
Grace, I'm not only
Lynette's husband
I'm also
the family lawyer.
My card.
We're
We're in
a sticky situation.
Mr. Simpson
won't speak to us.
He won't speak to anyone.
You're the first person
he's opened the door for.
How would you like to act
as our representative?
For a fee, of course.
Use your influence with Mr. Simpson
Help him to see
our point of view.
Well, I don't have any influence
with Mr. Simpson.
He slammed the door
in my face.
Ah, but first he opened it.
I think he'd
listen to you.
He'd get a handsome
cash settlement.
All he has to do
is disappear.
Disappear?
No interviews.
No book deals.
No public acknowledgement
that he was ever
in a relationship with Victor.
Which he wasn't.
Help us to convince him
it's time to let go and move on.
What if he doesn't want
to let go and move on?
We have plan ''B.''
We wait for him
to leave the house.
Then he's detained long enough
for us to change the locks.
Detained?
lsn't
lsn't that dangerous?
Don't worry.
It wouldn't be me personally.
You have my card.
I mean this in the best
possible way, Dad.
I think you should
put Mom away.
What, in a spa with mud packs
and sulfur baths?
- For taking a vacation?
- Not in a spa
She's on holiday.
How'd you feel if we put you away?
- Hello?
- Hello, Max?
Grace,
where the hell are you?
I'm in England, Max.
You know that.
I know, but where in England?
It's a big country.
Well, not really, Max.
Not compared
to the United States.
Grace, we've been having
a family meeting.
You're not going
to get me back
by spending all my money
in a foreign country.
Max, I need legal advice.
- Legal advice?
- Legal advice?
I told you she was
going to flip out.
How have you broken the law?
What have you done wrong?
Let's say I'm staying in the house
of a dead celebrity.
Did you break
into Victor Fox's house?
- She what?
- Shut up! Shut up! Listen.
Maybe it's okay for me
to be there because I was
possibly having a long-term relationship
with this dead celebrity.
Grace, you're insane.
Get to a doctor immediately.
Now the family
of this dead celebrity
Are we talking here
about Victor Fox's family?
About Victor Fox's house?
- About Victor Fox?
- Yes.
What are you
doing in his house?
It's not me.
This is all hypothetical.
Okay... Let's call
this person ''D.S.''
Who's ''D.S.''?
Well, he...
He may
or may not be...
He may or may not
be Victor Fox's...
Victor Fox's
homosexual lover.
We've got to get
a number on her. Grace?
Now, if Victor
died without a will
and D.S. claims the house
was left to him verbally,
and he was Victor's
''special friend''
You're a stalker.
does he have a chance
of keeping the house?
Grace,
give me your number.
Of course he gets
to keep the house.
Why should he be left with nothing?
Victor promised him.
It's not that simple
if there isn't a will.
Liberace. His chauffeur sued
the estate and won.
Yeah, but there was
evidence there
of a long-term,
meaningful relationship.
So you're saying there has to be
some kind of written proof?
- Joint bank account.
- Name on a phone bill.
- Something co-owned.
- Something with both
Why am I even discussing
this with you, Grace? I want you back.
Not personally.
I want you back in this country.
And if you do not return immediately
you will force me
to sell all of our possessions
to pay your bills.
I will sell
the furniture
Great.
Mmm.
Pete, Dave,
get down here.
What is it?
Dirk, you cooked us breakfast.
Good for you.
This is your first step
on the road to recovery.
- I did not do this.
- It's a miracle!
What is that sound?
I turned on the hot water tap
and hot water came out.
- Dirk, did you fix it?
- No!
Go away!
You are not my mother!
Leave me alone!
Get off me!
I'm calling the police.
What's the rush?
At least let her finish the front lawn.
Maybe we should
invite her in.
She might make us waffles.
She's stopped.
Whew!
Whoo!
Your hot water service
runs on fuel.
It's just like the one
in my parents' home.
You have to keep putting the fuel in.
Didn't you know that?
- I'd like to pay you.
- For what?
For the work you've done
and to go away.
I don't want to go away.
I want to help you.
- How much?
- Very much.
- Dirk, you better get back inside.
- Don't touch me.
Barry, the attorney, has men out there
waiting to detain you.
He wasn't specific
about the detaining
but I don't think it involves
giving you a cup of tea.
Did you know that they want to turn
your home into a tribute museum?
We have one in Chicago
for Al Capone.
It's a disgrace to his memory.
If such a thing is possible.
Now, my husband
ex-husband husband, is a lawyer,
and he says you need proof
of your relationship with Victor.
Love letters,
a joint bank account.
Look, I'm asking you nicely
even though you are a psychotic,
please leave.
Let me grieve in peace
without you in my kitchen
or my woodpile.
Get back inside right now
or I'm gonna give you a great big hug.
Look...
...if Victor was here,
do you know what he'd do?
He'd have you arrested.
Victor Fox hated women.
How do you know
what he felt?
Haven't you
worked it out yet?
- Leave before he hurts your feelings.
- He can be vicious.
Victor was gay!
Sissy!
A ''friend of Dorothy''!
A ''nelly''!
But his whole life
he had to pretend
he was this
heterosexual lover boy
just so he could
sell his music to sad,
lonely, middle-aged
housewives like you
and he hated it.
He hated all of you.
He hated his life of lies.
The only thing he
ever loved was me.
You make great pancakes.
You shouldn't
have done that.
She wasn't like
the others, Dirk.
She was like a real mother.
She could cook.
How will you get through
the funeral without us?
I'm not going
to the funeral.
But you have to go
to the funeral.
How can we prove
you had a relationship
if you don't go
to the funeral?
You have to make a scene
throw yourself onto the coffin.
Dirk...?
Dirk!
You'll end up
with nothing.
No house, no money
nothing.
It'll be like
you never existed.
You're a loser, Dirk.
Nothing!
We had the case won.
Sewn up, we had it won.
Wanker.
Hello boys.
Do you fancy a cup of tea?
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thanks very much.
I'd offer you wine
but I've already drunk it.
- Cough mixture?
- No.
Cherry flavor.
No, thank you.
- What's your name?
- Grace Beasley.
- From Chicago?
- Yes.
Sorry.
Brace yourself.
Victor's mother's room.
Victor and his sisters
were never allowed in here.
This is where mummy Fox
came to be alone...
with her dolls.
Mummy's wardrobe.
Now, in here...
is mummy's pink
chiffon robe...
with fake diamond tiara.
Victor used to sneak in here
when mummy was out,
dress up in her clothes
and play with her dolls.
He told her he was gay
when he was 16.
She blamed herself,
and then committed him
to a mental institution.
After he was ''cured''
he came back home
waited until his parents
were out
slipped in here
and smashed every doll
he could get his little gay hands on.
Victor's boyhood bedroom.
After the doll incident,
mummy threw him out.
She got all his toys
out of the attic
and then redecorated
his room.
Set it back it time
to when he was eight years old.
She just reinvented
his memory.
The family,
more or less,
pretended he was dead.
Never mentioned him again.
Victor never went to her funeral,
but she left him the house
all the same.
And he kept it just as it was
in memory of mummy.
He used to sit
in that chair
smoking his pipe...
wearing her pink chiffon robe
and fake diamond tiara.
- No!
- Oh yes.
Somehow I don't think
that'll be making it
into the tribute museum,
do you?
People say
I was a loser...
but really,
it was Victor.
He was gonna come out
on an American talk show.
lmagine, 55 years old
and he suddenly gets the courage
to tell the world
who he really is...
and...
he's shot through the heart
with a crossbow.
There's no justice.
How did you meet?
His voice.
I wanted him to sing my songs.
I'm a
I was a songwriter.
And, well I stalked him.
I tracked him down to his recording studio.
Forced him to listen
to them.
He told me I had
no talent whatsoever,
but he asked me out.
- That's what Max said to me.
- What?
On our second date,
I told him that I wanted
to be a singer.
Really?
And he said he didn't think
that was very realistic...
because I was
''too ordinary'' to succeed.
It's the flattery
that reels you, isn't it?
I was 25.
He was 45.
He was funny.
Generous, drunken,
manic-depressive,
self-centered,
unfaithful,
terribly unfaithful.
Did I say funny?
Yes.
Funny,
unfaithful bastard.
You know...
a week wouldn't go by
without him cheating on me.
But he'd say, ''Dirk,
I have sex
with other men...
but I sleep with you.''
''Unconditional Love.''
What?
Your poem.
It's cruel.
I was drunk when I wrote that.
I should have written,
''Unconditional Masochism.''
That's what it was.
I don't believe in unconditional love.
What is it?
''Cut off my ears, steal my money
and I'll love you anyway''?
- Yes. And more.
- More?
''You don't have
to love me back.''
God, what I wouldn't give
to get out of here and have a drink.
Been cooped up
in here for days.
Ow!
Shine that thing down.
They'll see it.
Ow!
I can't find my hole.
What hole?
The hole I made
in your hedge.
That's how I broke in.
Do they really have
singalongs in English pubs?
No, that's something
you read about in guidebooks.
ln real life,
they're bashing up queers.
- Maybe we shouldn't go.
- Why?
- I forgot how much they hate me.
- That's because you're rude.
''Rude''? Excuse me.
Do you know what it's like
to be gay in a small village?
Yes, I do.
My daughter-in-law
is a dwarf.
Ow!
What?
She's a dwarf.
She's different.
She's more different than you.
People stare at her
wherever she goes.
All right. I lose, the dwarf wins.
Better luck next time.
You've got to be kidding.
I'm not getting on that.
Come on, Dirk.
It's too far to walk.
My little brother and I used to ride double
all the time when we were kids.
- He never fell off the handlebars.
- Handlebars?
Live a little.
We'll sit by the fire.
We'll toast Victor.
Nobody will even
notice us come in.
This doesn't mean
I trust you.
It'll be just like that movie
''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid''
when they go
bicycling together.
I'll be Paul Newman and you'll be
''the lovely Katharine Ross.''
Whatever happened to
''the lovely Katharine Ross''?
She fell off the bike
and broke her bloody neck.
- Raindrops keep falling on my head...
- Keep it steady!
And that doesn't mean my eyes are
too big for my bed
Hold on, it's a hill.
- No! Put on the brakes!
- Climb every mountain
Ford every stream...
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Slow down!
- Oh dear.
- What do you mean, ''Oh dear''?
- The brakes aren't working.
- No!
Now she's laughing!
We're going to die
and the mad bitch is laughing!
Listen,
they are singing.
- To Victor.
- To Victor.
Shh.
You're not normally
like this, are you?
I mean...
I'm getting to know someone
even you don't recognize.
Right?
If somebody told me Friday
where I'd be on Sunday,
I'd never
have believed them.
But where will you be tomorrow?
And who will you be?
I don't know.
The problem is you do.
You'll be in Chicago waiting for
your husband to come back.
You'll be Grace Beasley again
''frump without a life.''
Grace, I think this little adventure
of yours means something.
Or it's just another story you'll tell
in the old people's home.
Does it mean something, Grace?
Hm? Does it?
- I don't know what it means.
- I do.
I knew what it meant the moment
you broke into my home
and forced meals upon me.
You're intending to matter,
Grace.
You're returning to life,
only this isn't enough.
One trip to England never brought
anyone back to life.
This is only
the beginning.
I want us to go to Chicago,
hunt down the Crossbow Killer
and bring him to justice.
There's more.
The ugly sisters. I want justice there, too.
I want them to suffer.
Vengeance.
- Anyway, it's all your fault.
- My fault?
You inspired me, Grace.
With your bravery.
You refused to let everyone's
rejection of you define
what you could probably become
if you had a bit more courage.
- Thank you.
- You showed me the way.
I can't hide
in that house anymore.
I have to be Dirk Simpson again
and I have to be proud of him.
- Vengeance won't bring Victor back.
- But it will bring us back.
- How?
- We'll matter again.
- But there are other ways we can matter.
- Grace...
If I was the valet
and you were the wife,
neither of us has existed
for some time.
I'm sorry.
Are you the valet?
No.
Yes.
I mean, no.
I was his boyfriend...
for over 1 0 years.
- Dirk
- No
I washed his underwear
and ironed his shirts
occasionally.
But in between all that
I was his boyfriend.
Go on...
what do you want to say?
It's him.
To the memory of Victor Fox.
Victor Fox.
To Victor.
Who am I
if I'm not Max's wife?
What am I
supposed to be?
Did I disappoint you, Grace?
Oh, no, Victor.
Well, mummy's room
was a bit of a shock.
Do you know,
if we had met...
I think I'd have
liked you very much.
Victor...
you were gay.
Ah, yes.
There was that.
Still...
you're a damn
fine-looking woman, Grace.
Oh, Victor.
I always imagined you'd say
something like that.
Not even a smile, Dirk?
I can't.
I'm too angry with you.
What were you doing down there
under the city anyhow?
You know why I was there.
I was looking for someone
to help me through the night.
You found yourself a maniac
in your fucking glittering suit.
He didn't choose me
for my suit.
I'm scared
without you, Victor,
even though
you were a shit.
Dirk...
I had sex
with other men...
but I slept with you.
I need to see Victor Fox.
It's an emergency.
He's dead.
He doesn't have emergencies.
FuneraI's in 1 2 hours.
I'm Victor Fox's loyal valet.
Show him the clipping.
See what it says?
''Victor Fox's loyal valet.''
That's me. I'm here to see that
he's dressed appropriately.
He is dressed appropriately.
His sisters picked out
a nice beige suit.
Beige? He was an entertainer,
not an accountant.
- He was funny.
- Outrageous.
Gay and very particular
about his burial garments.
He hated beige.
Who's she?
Oh, this is my lawyer,
Perry Mason.
Pleased to meet you.
I hope I don't have
to see you in court.
Thank you so much for coming.
Victor loved you since
he was a little boy.
Me, too.
I'm so very sorry.
My deepest condolences.
No!
This is outrageous.
- Smile for ''The Enquirer.''
- Oh, bugger off.
Well, this is roomy.
Where was Victor killed?
Can you see from here?
No.
It's under the city.
We should sleep tonight
and start tomorrow.
What's that sound?
The wind.
I used to have a noisemaker
to block out the sound
''Bubbling Brook''...
''Tropical Surf''...
''Frogs.''
I love you, Grace.
I love you too, Dirk.
Grace?
The strangest dream
I was sleeping
with my mother
while being watched
by a dwarf.
Maudey.
It's not how it looks.
Maudey!
Maudey, wait.
Grace has got a boyfriend!
He's not
He's not my boyfriend.
Is he a stud?
A hustler?
Can I try him?
Ooh.
Look at him.
He's gorgeous.
All I was expecting you to bring back
from England was a picture of Big Ben.
Maudey, Dirk is gay.
- What?
- He's gay.
This gets better
and better.
Welcome to Chicago, Dirk.
You naughty confused boy.
Maudey,
we need your advice.
Follow your heart.
Don't let other people's definition
of normal cramp your love life.
Love a young, gay,
tall British man
if that's what you want.
No, we need a gun.
A gun?
Why?
Well...
Dirk was Victor Fox's
longtime companion,
and...
we've decided to hunt down
the Crossbow Killer
and bring him to justice.
I thought it best
to tell it to you straight.
- You've changed, Grace.
- We need it by tonight.
Something small
that would fit in my purse.
You mean...
something like...
...this?
Oh my God!
Where did you get that?
Does Andrew know
you have that?
Oh get real, Grace.
You know how paranoid he is.
He gave it to me
after Pokey was born.
- Along with diapers.
- Can I see it?
Have either of you
ever fired a gun before?
Why are you wearing
that ridiculous coat?
''Don't Look Now.''
It's a disgusting
offensive movie
about a psychotic dwarf
in a red raincoat
who cuts people's throats.
- Never heard of it.
- Doesn't matter.
Nobody messes with a dwarf
in a red raincoat.
What time is it?
It's 3:30.
We should stop for a while.
Coffee?
Grace.
I smell coffee.
- Would you like some?
- Grace!
Grace.
Oh, hello.
Coffee?
Come here often?
- Ham and cheese?
- Everyone
Everyone!
Can I ask you fine people
a question?
Do any of you know
the whereabouts
or the identity
of the Crossbow Killer?
That bastard!
That bastard!
That bastard!
That bastard!
Bastard! That bastard!
That bastard!
Why you bring him up?
That bastard killed Bill.
And he killed Alice.
Sweet old Alice...
- singing all the time.
- Singing all the time.
It wasn't Alice who sang.
It was Bill.
- It was Alice.
- It was Bill!
- It was Alice!
- Maybe they both sang.
- You don't know!
- We're gonna catch the Crossbow Killer.
He comes quietly,
or we blow him away.
No.
Mmm.
Some vigilantes.
Officially sanctioned
by the homeless.
I saw something.
What is that?
- It's the cops.
- Oh my God.
- Dirk, kiss Grace passionately.
- What?
I have a gun in my jacket.
We're vigilantes.
They'll think you're lovers.
Kiss her.
- No.
- Then kiss me.
I'm not kissing anyone.
Did you see that?
What?
Did you ever see a movie called
''Don't Look Now''?
What are you
doing down here?
Um...
I was necking
with my boyfriend.
Dirk!
Good evening, officers.
You this young lady's boyfriend?
I am.
What are you doing?
I was watching them.
You know these people?
- Yes.
- No.
Oops.
Don't worry. Nothing terrible.
Carrying a concealed weapon.
And if you brought Pokey here
to shame me, it didn't work.
It was my first offense so they knocked it
down to a misdemeanor.
Oh, Mommy missed you.
What are you doing?
There's a court
appearance next week.
There'll be a significant fine to pay.
They didn't charge you,
Grace, or, um
Dirk.
That's Dirk?
Mm-hm.
Thank you
for coming, Max.
Oh, no.
We need to talk, Grace.
You sold our furniture.
Oh, no, no.
I was angry.
It's really
back in my place.
Oh.
Uh, look.
Why don't I take you to breakfast?
Well, you're
not dull anymore, Grace.
I was the one who wanted
to do dangerous things.
Look at you
in the last two weeks.
You've been to England.
Tracked a serial killer.
Been arrested.
Made new friends.
All I've done
is changed apartments.
I haven't even managed
to unpack my things.
I don't want a divorce.
Dirk,
Grace is my wife,
and I am going
to fight you for her.
I realize I've been
a complete fool.
And I guess what I'm asking is that
you give up Dirk here.
But Max, darling,
I'm afraid you're ow!
Yeah, but then again, Max.
Look here, Max...
Grace is my woman now.
Grace, I know he's young.
And handsome.
Oh, thanks.
But we've put in a lot
of years together, kid.
And when you've got
two people like us,
with all the good stuff behind us
and good stuff that could be,
it just doesn't make sense to discard it,
right? I mean, it
First time we met,
how cold it was.
You lent me your scarf.
And then that silly little apartment
in Milwaukee my first job.
How far would I travel
to be where you are?
What is the distance
from here to a star?
And if I ever lost you,
how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean...
Ah... you don't
want to take me back.
It's over.
Max!
Max!
He needs me.
He fought for me.
Nobody's ever fought for me.
Here's the key
to my apartment.
It was staring us
in the face all the time.
What was?
The reason he chose Victor,
and the tramps.
There wasn't a reason.
I want you to stay
as long as you like.
Off you go.
I'm British
and I need a gun.
Oh!
It's...
Nice, Max.
It... It doesn't
feel like home.
Do you know
what I'd like to do?
- What's that?
- I'd like to sing.
- Why don't you?
- You mean it?
I missed your singing.
It always drove me crazy but...
when it wasn't there
I really missed it.
Oh, no. I don't mean
around the house.
I mean,
sing to people.
You mean in public?
Yeah. I'd be scared,
but yeah.
ln a bar.
You want to be
a lounge singer?
Well, at first.
And then, who knows?
I mean,
anything's possible.
Well, I agree
that anything's possible
but it's not
very realistic, is it?
I mean,
shouldn't you have...
explored this line
of work earlier...
when you were younger?
So that you might have
had the opportunity
and the time to
to fail?
But what about
dangerous things, Max?
Oh, I think we've done
our dangerous things.
I mean, I've had enough danger
to last a lifetime.
So...
you want it
the way it was?
No.
Similar, but different.
''Hello, you've reached
Andrew and Maudey.
That's right,
we're back together.
So for those of you who doubted that
this was a marriage made in heaven,
Fuck you!''
No, too bitter.
''Hello, I'm a goddess.
He got down on his knees
and begged me.''
Hello.
- Maudey?
- Grace?
Why do you think the Crossbow Killer
chose Victor?
Grace, remember closure?
Well, we closed.
But Dirk said
there was a reason.
He said it was staring us
in the face.
The reason is
he met a psycho.
It could have been anyone.
But it wasn't anyone.
It was Victor Fox.
- And two tramps.
- We got what we wanted.
I got Andrew,
you got Max.
We should be happy and getting on
with our new lives.
What about Dirk?
No matter what I do...
Go back to bed, Grace.
Whatever happened between you
and Dirk is over.
Doesn't matter where you go
or what you do
I want to spend each day
of my life with you...
You're right.
I got what I wanted.
Didn't I?
- Now listen, honey...
- It's singing.
- What?
- Remember what the tramp said?
The ones who were killed
were singing all the time.
- What if Victor was singing too?
- He kills anyone who sings.
Grace!
Grace!
What are you doing?
I'm trying to attract
the Crossbow Killer.
We thought you were
going to sing.
- Were did you get that gun?
- What are you wearing?
It's Victor's. He wore a suit like this
on the night he died.
Dirk, you're gonna
get yourself killed.
You know what Victor
used to say?
''A life lived in fear
isn't a life worth living.''
- No he didn't.
- What do you mean, ''No he didn't''?
He said, ''A life lived in fear...
isn't much fun.''
- ''lsn't much fun''?
- Yes, worth living but not much fun.
- Come off it. Victor would never say that.
- Can we get out of here?
I happen to know he did.
A bartender told me.
Does Max love you?
It's a simple question.
Did he tell you he loved you?
ln his way.
Good.
Now piss off.
Unlike the two of you,
I have fears to face.
- Dirk, you did it.
- Now what?
I don't know.
I didn't think it would work.
Don't move. Far as I know he can only
shoot one of us at a time.
- Which one?
- You're the one in the glitter suit.
Stay together.
Maybe you shouldn't stay
too close to Dirk, Grace.
God, I think I just got us all killed.
No!
You I know you.
Who?
You're her in the room
with the baby.
You mean Pokey?
You saw me
with my grandson?
Who are you?
I do know you.
You clean my windows.
Seeing you
and that baby dancing...
reminded me of my mother...
and her love.
For God's sake,
say something.
Yes
You're not gonna be loved
pointing a crossbow at people.
You!
- You're just like everybody else!
- No, we're not!
Look at us.
Do we look like everybody else?
We're not.
We're like you.
We're unloved, unnoticed.
I am not unnoticed.
Don't you read the papers?
Yes you're very famous.
Even I've heard of you, and I'm British.
I know that jacket.
No, you don't.
Everyone's wearing them in Britain
They're all the rage.
The streets are a-glitter.
What were you and the baby dancing to?
What was that song?
It was a song
by Victor Fox.
Oh.
I didn't mean
to hurt him.
My mother had a lot
of his records.
But he was walking alone
and he was singing
and when they sing it makes me think of
my mother and I get sad.
I have to make
them stop.
What was that song
you were singing to the baby?
What?
Was it...
Was it
''I Can't Smile Without You''?
My mother used to sing that to me
when I was little.
- No...
- Yes, it was.
Yes, it was.
Yes, it was.
How does that go again?
Huh?
All right,
sing it for me!
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.
I'm sor...
''V.F.''?
''V.F.''!?
Victor Fox!
You knew him!
Liars!
Stinking liars!
Run!
- Gun!
- Maudey, get the gun.
I got it.
Run!
Maudey!
Grace!
Wait!
Dirk!
Run!
Jump!
Ugh!
Christ!
Grace!
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Oop!
Don't let me die
in a glitter suit!
My leg! Oh!
Hold on! Maudey,
grab onto something!
Ah! Get off!
Get off!
Get off it!
Get off!
I don't want to die!
Don't let go.
Maudey!
- Grace!
- Grace!
No.
All right, that's it.
Don't come any closer, you freak.
I'm calling the police.
I can get a signal up here.
You're gonna wish you never met me.
You're in big trouble now.
- Please...?
- You piece of shit.
Oh my God!
- Hello.
- Max?
- Grace, where are you?
- I'm with Dirk.
- Dirk?
- He's in emergency. I can't talk long.
- Which hospital? I'm on my way.
- No.
Max...
we need to discuss
our marriage.
Our marriage?
I'm sorry, Max.
I love you.
I always have.
But I never expected you
to say it back.
That wasn't a condition
Because I was too afraid
of the answer.
Now it is a condition.
I don't want
''similar but different.''
I need different.
Well, I... don't know
if I know how to be different.
Find a way.
We've read about them
and we've seen them on the news,
but who are they really?
Please help me to welcome
Chicago's own
Crossbow Killer heroes,
Grace Beasley...
Maudey Beasley...
and Dirk Simpson!
Wow!
Is that the way it felt
these last few weeks?
Whoo!
Wow!
Yeah, absolute wow, Sally.
All right!
Maudey, facing death
completely unarmed,
you take out the Crossbow Killer
with a mobile phone.
That must have been
a ''David-and-Goliath'' moment for you.
Actually, Sally...
I was really fed up
with the phone.
Batteries always seem to die
in the middle of your
most important calls.
Haven't you noticed that?
That's why I was so excited
when Sprint PCS approached me
with this new state-of-the-art
digital phone.
With batteries that have
five days' standby time,
I know if I'm ever cornered by another
crossbow-wielding maniac
my call will get through.
Dirk, you've lost
the love of your life,
and then you
avenged his death.
You are one macho,
take-charge kind of guy.
I love you, Dirk!
Dirk, I love you!
Is it over?
Can you move on?
Well, I'm lucky to have friends.
And, actually,
the Fox sisters have been incredibly
supportive since Victor died.
That's why I invited them
here tonight.
Nola, Harriet, Lynette,
please stand up
so that we can see you.
The loving sisters
of Victor Fox.
I couldn't have got through
this ordeal without them.
ln fact, they have
given me Victor's house.
No.
- Yes.
- Incredible.
- Isn't it?
- Wonderful.
I want to make it
into a hostel
for gay youths who've been
kicked out of their homes
by their intolerant families.
I think Victor would have
wanted it that way.
I know the Fox sisters
want it that way.
We love gay youth.
Grace!
It's been quite a journey.
We've read about you.
We've heard about you.
What is there left to say?
Actually,
I have something
I'd like to say.
Sir, what is your name?
My name is Max Beasley
and I'm Grace's husband
ex-husband.
Yes, Max.
What would you like to tell us?
Well, it's not much, really.
Just that...
I'd like to hear
Grace sing.
Come on, sing it, girl.
Sing it, baby.
Thank you, Max.
I think we have
a surprise for you, Grace.
Oh my
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Barry Manilow.
Grace,
may I accompany you?
Oh, no, no.
Yes! Yes!
You've got to do it.
All right.
How about that?
Bravo!
