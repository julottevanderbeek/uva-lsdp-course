JOY FELLOWS
"Transparent sources"
Writing on the gateway:
"Close the gate when you walk in"
Re-lieved by joyfull song
She never lest sadden
Cities and countrysides admire the song
And admire the song bigger towns
Song helps us to live and to love
She like a friend calls and leads
And who with song strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost
And who with song strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost
Re-lieved by joyfull song
She never lets sadden
Cities and countrysides admire the song
And admire the song bigger towns
Song helps us to live and to love
She like a friend calls and leads
And who with song strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost
We are able to sing and laugh, like children
Among obdurate fight and work
So we were born like this
That we never give up, nowhere and never
Song helps us to build and to live
She like a friend calls and leads
And who with song strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost
And who with song strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost

Oh how you played walking through the countryside
For a music like this
they should rip hands off.
You, Germans are
a hot nation.
Can this be called "playing"?
You should play like Sapojnik!
Mister, please don't
compare me to him.
I can't play likeSapojnik.
Sapojnik has been doing it
for seven years,
And I only for two!
Shut up!
Take your violin and play!
What should I play?
Oh... play this!
Well!
The scores came to bits.
Costa Frascini!
Frascini, composer?
Conductor. He arrived today.
Mom, mom!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Where he is?
Here!
In foreign bathrobe.
I'm going to meet him.
But it's not quite the thing.
Stay calm.
I'll do it subtly.
...will never and nowhere be lost.
Allright.
Enough for today.
Auf viedersehen.
Goodbye.
Please tell me,
do we have hot water today?
Yes.
Let's get to know ourselves.
Look. a fish!
Fish, fish, fish.
My mum is delighted
with your music.
You are such a young man,
and yet a genius.
But... how it is possible?

How I envy you.
And where are you living?
In "Transparent sources".
Oh, there!
Nearly on the top.
You made a life, mister.
And you're alone there?
Aren't you sad?
Why alone?
There is a lot of us.
He's got a professor here...

Oh, dutchwomen are elegant...
Shapes they have...

I'd like to be on their place.
And what are you doing?
Me?
I'm a singer.
A singer!
Sing something, lady.
Now?
Here?
Well... yes.
In costume it's not quite a thing.
But if you'd agree...
What?
...to come to us.
I? To you?
And where do you live?
In "Black Swan".
Oh, you made a life.
I'll get you to know with my mother.
Please come.
And she won't be angry?
What you..?
My mum will die from joy!.
Well.
If she dies, I'll come.
So, everything is established,
I'll be waiting for you.
Ay, what a woman?
You could die for her!
In this frock-coat I played
in 1893 in Stuttgart.
Oh God, I was the same
about 40 years ago.
Today you're playing in front of the audience.
Bring dignity out of you.

And you want to gain happiness.

Nice to meet you.
What's happeinng?

Simply slaughter.
And what?
She has no hands,

We invite to dance
Well, let's dance.
Maestro, so far
you ran from me?
Why are you so
devoted to this place?
- You can see it?
- What?
That I'm devoted.
Of course, on this place
you're visible for everyone.
About what place are you talking?
- About a window.
- Oh, a window.
I thought that about a place
I'm deovted to.
I mean you
haven't noticed nothing?
No.
And that I'm devoted,

Good.
We'll drink a cup of kruszon

And where are you going?
So?
Och, strong!

When I'll see you again?
Tomorrow I can't, I have a hairdresser.
Maybe... tomorrow evening?
You'll come to the oak.
Will you?
Will you?
Yes.
I feel...
...that my heart is goning to rip apart!
Maestro, maybe play something for us?
Please.
I don't have my violin...

Out of here!
Bravo.
Without glasses I can't see a thing.
Time to eat something!
Maestro, to the table.
Aniuta, Aniuta!
Where's Aniuta?
In a minute, a minute.
In a minute, a minute.
Please fetch spirit of camphor.
Where it is?
In bedroom.
My God, who's this?
First time in my life..!
Good toy, well made.
Looks like it's living.
Better are made abroad.
Please look at the head.
Is this a sheep?
Head indeed... it's not the best part.
But the chopper is very similar.
By the way,
I'd like to keep the memory
about today evening.
Do you have a photograph?
I have, but it's really small.
Here it is.
If you are so kind, please
give it to me with your autograph.
With what?
With autograph.
Miss Helena,
I wouldn't scant you anything...
...but I don't have what I don't have.
Where you came, run away.
Carefully, hang tough lady.
Carefully, hang tough lady.
Carefully....
Hang tough lady!
Carefully...
A tiger!
Tiger.
God... who's this?
It's me.
How you came here?
I went to the composer, Frascini.
But he'a already here.
No, he's there.
How he could be there, if it's him?
No.
It's not him.
Who are you?
Me?
Kolka Patiechin.
- What Patiechin?
- Herdsman.
How herdsman?
As per usual, herdsman.
Usual herdsman?
No, not usual, but main!
- Young man...
- Please call Lena...
Herdsman has nothing to talk
to my daughter.
I hope that this misunderstanding
will remain between us.
Please take this and go away.
But you invited
me yourself...
Yes, but the thought that
you are a musician...
... and you are a herdsman.
Today herdsman...
and... and tomorrow musician.
So please come "tomorrow".
Now get along!
Away!
There are lots of pretty girls
There are lots of pretty names
But only one bothers
Taking calm and sleep away
When you are in love.
Love will stun you unexpected
When you don't bide it
And suddenly every evening becames
Suprisingly beautiful
And you sing
Heart, you don't want to be calm
Heart, how good is to live
Heart, how good you are like this
Thank you heart that you can love like this.
Heart, you don't want to be calm
Heart, how good is to live
Heart, how good you
are like thid
Thank you heart that you can...
...love like this.
Hours have passed..
Konstant Iwanowicz.
To me?
I'm here for Helena Siergiejewna.
Lena sent you here?
Wait, wait...
I've seen you before.
I've seen you
many times.
By morning.
When I buy milk...
...you always pass by
with your herd.
Is she mad?
A mosquito was sitting on you,
Konstanty Iwanowicz
There are lots of mosquitos.
But why she didn't came
be herself?
Who?
Lena.
You live here permanently?
She's mad at me.
Who taught you to play like this?
Where is Lena?
I'm going away tomorrow.
And Lena?
Today.
Is going away?
Oh, she went away!
She sailed by steamboat.
And I'm going by train, tomorrow.
She went away.
It was a big mosquito,
Konstanty Iwanowicz.
Mosquito, mosquito...
...and she, unfortunately, went away.
I thought...
... thought, thought.
Too late.
Konstantynie Iwanowiczu.
Kostia!
Kostiaaaaaa!
I'm all burning and I don't know why
Dear heart! How should I live now?
Ah, why from all the men, the only one
Can we love in our life!
Heart in chest!
Is flapping like a bird
And you want to know, what's waiting for you
And you want to gain happiness.
And you want to know,
what's waiting for you
And you want to gain happiness.
Joy is singing like
spring skylark
Life is warm and bright
If I had ten hearts
I'd give every single one to him.
Heart in chest
Is flipping like a bird
And you want to know,
what's waiting for you
And you want to gain happiness.
Month's up.
The minute hand
runs throught clock face
Quickly as mad
are running cogwheels.
Minutes are jumping
throught troubles and cases
Jumpin, jumping, jumping...
...and so month's up.
Yes.
But the conductor is still not here!
How will he conduct,
if the orchestra had never seen him?
- It a scandal.
- What to do!
- The audience is making you mad?
Yes.
So why are you staying here?
Go and calm them!
You, why are you staying?
Come here!
Hold!
Strange.
We only have 5 minutes
and he's not here!
How will we play?
The worst is that without any rehearsal.
And also they say,
that he's a freak.
We need to follow
his every move and gesture.
"Passing on the backstage prohibited"
Haven't you seen the one
in jacket...
... and white hat?
To hell with it all!
Could be worse.
We lost him.
- Here, please.
- Gracias.
Please don't aggrevate.
Everything will be allright.
Understand me!
Understand me!
Oh, stupid.
Original conduction.
Mom!
We threw away the real one!
Guve me binocular!
Emma, for these tears
I love you even more.
Maestro, you're mad at me.
But it wasn't me.
It was my mum.
I'm so rancorous.
Forgive the elderly lady.
Let's bow... bow.
It was nice to meet you.
Let's go for a dinner.
The races begin again.
Now that's a man!
Amazing.
We need one like this
to the orchestra.
Hold him!
Hold!
We do, we do!
Hold him.
Harder.
And so, are you
joining our orchestra?
Orchestra?
Do you agree?
Agree!
Months have passed.
"Friendship"

How you play?
It's not me.
I can't exercise
in those conditions!
It unnerves...
Behind a wall.
Hey, you!
Couldn.t you be quiet?
I can't work!
Do your best, I'll go
and make a complaint to commandant.
Well, come on, let's try.
This phrase should be played differently!
No, like this!
He's right.
No, he's not!
No, he is right!
This phrase should be played like this!
No, this!
And so?
Okay, play,
but hands close to yourself!
Comrade commandant.
We are
artists.
We need
dead silence.
And devil knows,
what's going on from the morning.
Szum, tararam.
Please embark

Please pay attention,
to what's happening there.
Devil knows what
comrade commandant.
Please do your best.
O, that's how it sholud be played!
Please pay attention,
comrade commandant,
it's a mess!
To my mind, it's not there.
To my mind, it's nearby.
It's not you,
comrade Patiechin?
Comrade commandant.
We are artists...
Of course it's you!
But what are you, comrade,
but...
...artists...!
We're in silence!
Dead silence.
What was happening here?
We ha.. had..

You had a rehearsaland I'll kick you out!
Everything fizzled out.
First time in our life...
...we go into Great Theather...
...and so... very well.
And where are
we going to do rehearsal now?
Rehearsals?
We have no place for it!
Me must serve notice,
that we won't play.
I know where're going to do rehearsal.

Filemon, Filemon, wake up!
Take out half a liter.
Stay, stay...!
Leave something for the lady.

You'll go with me.
We're going to them.

Sing as they please you.
Heart in chest
Is flipping like a bird
And you want to know,
what's waiting for you
And you want to gain happiness.
Love will stun you unexpected
When you don't bide it
And suddenly every evening becomes
Suprisingly beautiful
And you sing
Heart, you don't want calm
Heart, how good is
to live
Heart, how good you
are just like this
Thank you heart,
that you can love like this.
...thant you can love like this.
Ciuch, ciuch, ciuch, ciuch,
Our iron has already warmed up.
You fell in love, realized
You met a wrong womam.
You got mad, looked behind
And saw a beauty one.
Tiuch, tiuch, tiuch, tiuch,
Our iron has already warmed up.
Everyone can make a mistake,
Love is really tiring,
Cause not in vain they say:
We learn the hard way.
Tiuch, tiuch, tiuch, tiuch,
Our iron has already warmed up.
I'm nothing in comparision to her,
But it'll change.
He'll be mine -
And never go away.
Aniuta, I always wanted
to say to you...
Leave her!
Aniuta, I always
Let me speak!
Aniuta, I always wanted
to say to you...
Song helps us
to live and to love
Like a friend
calls and leads
And who with song
strides through life
Will never and nowhere
be lost
Song helps us
to live and to love
Like a friend
calls and leads
And who with song
strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost
Song helps us
to live and to love
Like a friend
calls and leads
And who with song
strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost
And who with song
strides through life
Will never and nowhere be lost
We are able to sing and laugh,
like children
Among obdurate fight and work
So we were
born like this
That we never give up
nowhere and never
And who with song
strides through life
And who with song
strides through life
Will never and nowhere
be lost
Never and nowhere
be lost!
