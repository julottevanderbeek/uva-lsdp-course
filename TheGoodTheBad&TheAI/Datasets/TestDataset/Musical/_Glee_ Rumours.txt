Glee:
Kurt Hummel's back at McKinley!
But you told me
you were in love with me.
I honestly don't know
what I was thinking.
I have a question.
Destroy the Glee Club!
The League of Doom.
I don't think I was listening
when you said what our name was.
Is it League or Legion?
Worst henchmen ever.
Glee!
Fondue for Two!
Fondue for Two!
That's some hot dish!
Fondue for Two!
Hi, I'm Brittany S. Pierce,
and this is my new Internet
talk show,
which combines the two things
I like most:
hot cheese
and talking to people.
My first two guests are
the school's biggest gossips,
Mercedes Jones and
Ms. Tina Cohen-Chang.
Shouldn't it be
Oh, my God, that is hot!
Okay, so let's get down
to some hot dish.
Um, I heard a rumor that
Mr. Kidney the janitor walks
around school drinking vodka
out of a teapot.
Is this really what they were
doing in the '70s?
Hot mess Mr. Kidney
aside, I want
to talk about the rumor
about Asian men: not true.
I mean, it's not even good.
It tastes the way
a baby's diaper smells.
I heard a rumor that Santana
plays for the other team,
and I can confirm that rumor:
It's 100% true.
Wait. What?
Brittany, are you serious?
Yes.
BRITTANY:
Look, it's Lord Tubbington.
Hi!
Hi.
This is Lord Tubbington.
:
Say hi to the camera.
You want some cheese?
That's disgusting.
That's my baby.
So, you're just gonna
gonna let him do that?
Lord Tubbington's allowed to eat
cheese because he's on Atkins.
Okay, well, that's all we have
time for today.
Tune in next week
for
We will be dipping raw meat
into boiling chocolate.
Fondue for Two!
Hey.
Why are you talking to me?
Can't I say hello?
I guess. It's just Santana
told me never
to speak alone with you
because you would try
to steal all of my gold.
Okay, uh... anyway,
I got you this.
I know everyone's always
making fun of your lips,
but I think they're cute
and worth weatherproofing.
So, considering that
we're both single
and I think your lips are cute,
I was wondering if you would
go to to prom with me?
As in your date?
Yeah.
No.
No... "No, No" as in...?
As in no prom.
Oh.
I don't think I'm going.
Are you worried
that Finn will be jealous?
Look, you're just
not my type, okay, Rachel?
So thanks for the lip chap.
I feel like my life
finally has purpose.
It's so nice to be a part of a
cause that's bigger than myself.
Honey Badger, I am so thrilled,
Can I ask why you're dressed
like David Bowie?
I'm incognito.
We're going deep
behind enemy lines.
People are starting
to sense my weakness.
They think I've
totally lost my grip.
Can I help you?
Oh, yes.
Can I have a hot tea, please?
I'd just like a large cup
of mocha powder.
David Bowie's incredibly
eccentric.
Um, we don't take euros.
So, Honey Badger, last week,
I had a revelation.
Now, as you may
or may not know,
the Middle East is in chaos.
You know what started it all?
No. A little Web site
called Wikileaks.
You ever hear of them?
Well, they let loose
with a couple of rumors.
So I told Figgins
I wanted to resuscitate
But the school newspaper was
discontinued two years ago,
due to lack of interest.
The newspaper is making
a comeback at this school,
and like print
newspapers everywhere,
we're leaner
and meaner--
no longer concerned
with facts, fact-checking,
integrity or facts.
motto?
"If I heard it, it's probably
true or something."
Sorry, but did you just
change disguises?
I'm pretty sure that
barista's onto me.
Now I'm Ann Coulter.
As you may have noticed,
I'm coming slightly unhinged.
Ohio loves you, Ann Coulter!
That's better.
Can I make an observation?
You're always trying to destroy
Will from inside the Glee Club.
But I would like to try getting
him  of the Glee Club.
Now, I was trolling the Internet
last night and I had an idea.
I'll drink to that.
Excuse me.
Do you know
where a gal can find
a pipin' hot cup of
Will Schuester?
Oh, my God! April!
What are you doing here?
I thought you were on Broadway!
I was! My all-white production of
was a disaster.
- Oh, April, I'm so sorry.
- Don't be!
Being publicly humiliated
by the
gets me to thinking--
why am I weighing myself down
with the "Broadway classics"?
I should just tell my own story.
So I wrote the libretto
to
You're writing a musical?
Yep. That's why I'm here.
So, Will, remember how
I bought you your auditorium?
Oh, yeah.
Well, I'm gonna need to borrow it
cause I'm running a little low on funds.
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!
Get your  here.
Extra! Extra!
Get your  here!
Hey. I think we should talk
about Nationals.
We need to do a duet.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Why are you so concerned
with Quinn's feelings
when she obviously has
no interest in yours?
What are you talking about?
Haven't you read
It's our school's newspaper.
Look at the "Blind Items" column.
"What prom queen candidate is spending
a lot of time in her closet?"
Now that's garbage.
Quinn's claustrophobic.
No, that's Santana. Read the next one.
What the hell is this, dude?
"What blondie former cheerleader is having
"a secret Moonlight Motel rendezvous
- with another big-lipped blondie?"
- Where does it say that?
Right on the front page
of the school newspaper!
You don't seriously
believe this, do you?
Well, why shouldn't I? Why wouldn't he
do the same thing that I did to him?
Because it's gossip, Finn.
This is your fault!
You told everyone that I played
for another team on your
ridiculous melted cheese show.
Wait. Are you mad?
You  play for another team.
You were on the Cheerios! And now
you're only in the New Directions.
And you couldn't have thought
of any other way to say that?
I swear I'm going to
punch your face off!
Hey, you got a lot of nerve
accusing me of cheating
when you're the one who
snuck in and stole my girl!
Hey! Hey, Finn, where are you going?
Hey, we got rehearsal! Not today!
Dinner is served.
I thought you volunteered
to make dinner.
Well, Mama drinks her dinner these days!
Honk!
Uh...  can I be
blunt with you, April?
I think any show about April Rhodes
should be about your emotional journey.
Oh.
Hadn't really thought of that.
I forget what a good
teacher you are, Will.
Thanks.
And lately, I don't feel like it.
I mean, there's just so much drama in
the Glee Club right
now-- more than usual.
A lot of whispering and
backstabbing and love triangles
and questions of sexuality--
Sounds like your club's
got a touch of the Mac.
The what? Fleetwood Mac?
They fought all the time!
There was affairs and divorces
and whispers and gossip.
All the stuff that made
good bands break up.
But they put all that drama
to good use and wrote great music.
You know, I think I might have
on LP somewhere.
Oh, everybody does.
I mean, I don't. I sold mine for drugs.
Kidding! Ha! Nope.
I actually did that.
Here we go.
You know, I've wanted to
do a whole lesson devoted
to a single album for a long time.
You know, this is a
really good idea, April.
And I'm here to help.

Thunder only happens
when it's raining
When the rain washes
you clean you'll know
a classic
record by Fleetwood Mac.
One of the greatest albums of all time.
Written as the band
was breaking apart...
to keep it together.
Now, this week, we are done with
the backstabbing and the gossip,
and we're channeling all that
energy into working together.
So, pick a song from the album,
put your own spin on it.
Simple as that.
What's going on with you and Santana?
Nothing.
It doesn't sound like nothing.
It sounds like something,
which is almost always
more than nothing.
I'm down, Artie.
Are you cheating on me with her?
No, of course not. I mean...
I can't. She's a girl.
Fooling around with her isn't cheating.
It's just friends talking with
their tongues super close.
- Who told you that?
- Santana.
Don't you see that
she's manipulating you?
That's not cheating either.
She told me that.
Do you see what's going on here?
You're the hottest girl in this school,
and I wear saddle shoes
on legs that don't work.
This shouldn't be happening.
Not because I'm in a wheelchair
but because I'm obsessed
with Angry Birds
and my mom cuts my hair.
I like your haircut.
It's hard enough for me to
believe that this is real.
If I know that you spend even
a little time sharing
yourself with someone else...
that there's one other person in
your life that can provide
for you the things that
I'm supposed to provide,
it's just too much
for me to take.
And Santana knows that.
She's taking advantage of it
to break us up.
No. Everybody thinks she's
a bad person, but she's not.
God, Brittany,
why are you so stupid?!
You were the only person at this school
that never called me that!
She broke down and let me in
Made me see where I've been
Been down one time,
been down two times
I'm never going back again
Mmm... mmm-mmm...
Mmm... mmm-mmm...
You don't know
what it means to win
Come down and see me again
Been down one time
Been down two times
Mmm, never going back again
Mmm... mmm-mmm...
Stakeout.
So exciting.
It's like an episode
of
No, this is not fun or cool.
Then why did you agree
to do it?
Because Quinn cheated
on me with Puck,
and then she cheated
on Sam with me.
I just want to be sure.
I never understood why
you got back with her.
I mean, if you can't
even trust her.
I don't know.
I do.
Because you forgive
your first love anything.
Do you believe in that
thing called karma?
Uh, yeah.
Can you explain it to me?
Uh, well, it's the law
of physics
whereby, for example,
if you do something
to hurt someone,
well, then the laws
of the universe will work
against you until you get hurt.
While we're here,
have you given
any thought to my duet ideas?
I can't believe Kurt
would do that to Blaine.
What do we know
about Sam anyway?
I mean, what town is he from?
What state?
What's his old school like?
Maybe he's a serial killer.
You guys,
I'm telling you,
Kurt wouldn't cheat on Blaine.
It's just like
the  album.
I mean, being apart or on the
road is hard for two artists.
Performers have this "love the
one you're with" mentality.
I mean, look at all of us.
Look at all the different
combinations that we've had.
Finnchel, Puckleberry.
McTina Cohen Chang-Chang.
Artittany.
Pizes.
Guys, we're sitting here
squabbling over what? A rumor.
Finn's right.
We need more information.
I don't want to get into it,
but all I'm gonna say...
Sam's not gay.
God, I'm so sad.
Like a sad little panda.
Well, that's why
I brought you here...
to cheer you up.
I've been going through
that  album
and I found the best song
that really goes
one step past "Landslide"
in expressing my
feelings for you.
My... private feelings.
What about him?
He's just furniture.
Sorry. No offense.
Hit it.
For you...
There'll be no more crying
For you...
The sun will be shining
And I feel that
when I'm with you
It's all right
I know it's right
And the songbirds
are singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you,
I love you
Like never before
And I wish you all the love
In the world
But most of all
I wish it from myself
And the songbirds
keep singing
Like they know the score
And I love you, I love you,
I love you
Like never before
Like never before.
That was beautiful.
Okay, so why couldn't you
sing that to me
in front of everyone
now that Artie and I
aren't together?
No, not-not yet.
I'm not ready for that type
of public announcement.
Ever since
that  thing,
people have already started
treating me differently.
I got asked
to join the golf team.
Well, what if I went first?
Come on
I'll ask you out to prom
and I'll tell you how I feel,
and all you have
to do is say yes.
Okay.
Yeah.
Stop it.
Stop what?
I am begging you. Sam is cute,
but he's not worth losing
Blaine over.
Oh, how I've missed
your insanity.
He's wearing your jacket, Kurt.
I remember that jacket.
You wore it April of last year.
You said it was
your Earth Day jacket
because it was made out
of recycled hemp.
I know how these things work.
I remember when Finn
and I used to date.
Sometimes he would leave his
letterman jacket at my house,
and I'd wear it to
school the next day.
Okay, you need to bone up on
your Fleetwood Macology.
When they made
they weren't speaking
to each other.
Not even "Pass the
nondairy creamer."
They only spoke
about the music.
And it was that focus
that allowed them
to make their masterpiece.
You're deflecting.
No, I'm being a team player,
and any minute spent
on this vicious, hurtful
and hateful gossip
is a minute taken away
from preparing for Nationals.
Why would she say that thing
about Sam not being gay?
She was so sure about it.
Well, they did date.
Yeah, but the way
she said it--
there was something
else going on.
The problem with dating Quinn,
besides the mood swings,
is that she's so...
protective about her feelings.
You never quite know where
you stand with her.
Girls like that do that
to keep their power.
You never did that.
I always knew what
you were thinking.
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you sayin'
You would never break
the chain
Mr. Shue, thank you
for being
my first interview
for
To be honest,
I had no idea you were
the journalist type.
Yeah, I have a talk show on
the Internet,
and the comments say that
my questions are too gossipy.
So I joined
the school newspaper to learn
to ask the more hard-hitting
questions.
That's fantastic, Brittany.
So, question one:
boxers or briefs?
Uh, boxers.
Cool.
Okay, question two:
pantyhose or lace panties?
I just said boxers.
Yeah, well, that wasn't
one of the choices,
so I'll just write that you
refused to answer the question.
Brittany, these questions
sort of gossipy.
Okay, what age did you start
waxing your back?
Brittany, I don't think these
questions are very appropriate.
Well, hard-hitting journalism is
about asking the questions
that people really want to know.
Um, we need to address
some rumors.
How many students
have you had affairs with?
Wait...
There's a rumor about that?
There probably will be now
since you didn't really
answer the question.
None!
Is it the truth
or are you lying? Like when
you didn't give me a straight
answer about the lacy panties.
Brittany, I'm sorry, but I need
to work on some songs.
Are they songs for April Rhodes'
one-woman show?
Yes. Is it because you're
leaving the New Directions?
What?! Because there's a rumor
that you'd rather be on Broadway
than coaching the Glee Club.
Brittany, who gave you
these questions to ask me?
Coach Sylvester said I'm
not at liberty to say.
She told me this before she
finished writing these questions.
I thought so.
All right, Muckrakers, the rumor
mill is up and running.
On to lesson two.
Making... stuff... up.
Jacob, I want you to squeeze
this toothpaste into your hand.
Now put it back in.
Um, I can't.
Exactly.
Oh, no, I didn't! Oh!
SUE:
Fantastic, Azimio.
Now my point, ladies
and gentlemen, is that
once a story is out,
it's out forever.
You can't put it back in.
All right, Muckrakers,
we have a deadline.
All right,
get out of my classroom.
Get out of here!
Brett.
Sue, what are you doing?
Why are you spreading rumors
that I'm leaving McKinley?
Well, William, I'm sure
you don't dispute
that legendary bratwurst
gobbler April Rhodes is in town
and you're helping her
get back to Broadway.
Am I right?
Of course.
But it doesn't mean
I'm leaving the school.
Let me ask you
something, Will: Why?
You know what they say,
"Those who can't, teach."
Turns out
maybe you actually can.
Think about that next time you
prop your butt chin up on
one of those
tiny little face toilets.
Look at it this way, Will.
You'd finally be rid of me.
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it!
Get you  here!
I vote for Quinn.
Bite me, Fabray.
Finn.
Wait, why are you storming?
I'm the one
who should be storming.
Really? Because the way
I see it, I'm the stormer
and you should be the stormee.
According to today's paper,
"Finn and Rachel
were seen sitting closely, laughing, talking
intimately." We were on a stakeout.
What were you doing
with him in that motel?
I'm not cheating on you.
This time around,
I haven't and I won't.
You have to learn to trust me.
I can't trust you
if you won't tell me the truth.
Well, what were you and Rachel
doing together, huh?
Staking out. That's what
you do on a stakeout.
What were you talking about?
Glee Club, okay?
She wants to do
a duet with me. That's all. Trust me.
Well, then I guess we both have
to learn to trust each other.
- I guess so. - And I guess I know what song
we'll be singing this week in Glee Club
I don't want to know
the reasons why love keeps
Right on
walking on down the line
I don't want to stand
'tween you and love, honey
I just want you
to feel fine
I don't want to know
the reasons why love keeps
Right on
walking on down the line
I don't want to know
the reasons why love keeps
Right on
walking on down the line
I don't want to stand
'tween you and love, honey
I just want you
to feel fine
Finally, baby
The truth has been told
Now you tell me
that I'm crazy
That's nothing
that I didn't know
Trying to survive
Oh, you say you love me,
but you don't know
You got me rockin'
and a-reelin'
Hey, you know what you do
Oh, oh, yeah
Uh-huh
I...
I don't want to know.
Okay! Terrific job, guys.
Um, might want to try to smile
a little bit more
next time, though.
Yeah. It was lovely,
but I prefer
Quinn's duet performance
of "Lucky" with Sam better.
Since you and Sam have become
a lot closer lately, maybe
you guys should do duets
together more often.
Where is Sam?
Quinn and Kurt
are both here today,
so we know he's not
doing the dirty.
I know what you're doing.
You want Finn and I
to stop singing together
so that you can sing
with him again.
Frankly, yes. Finn and I have
amazing proven harmonies.
And when it comes to Nationals,
I think it makes more sense
for him to be paired with me.
Well, it's not happening.
Not as long as Finn wants
to be with me.
Wait, I thought you said this
relationship was about trust.
Oh, I trust you.
I just don't trust her.
Quinn, I don't think
you can mandate
who pairs up for
Nationals, all right?
Vocal Adrenaline doesn't need
any help from us.
I love being here,
and I want to win,
but my relationship
comes first.
I'm sorry, but Finn,
if you want to be with me,
no more songs with her.
What?!
We took a cab back
to my bachelor pad
I had a feeling
I would see this thing through
My doorman Stan,
he took you by the hand
As he said,
"Right this way, you two"
But you said
Stanley Glover
You were once
my lover!
It's April!
Yeah! I guess
I slept with you!
Because my name
is April Rhodes
I've kissed
princes and toads
And it's a good bet
I've slept with you!
You!
Will!
Will, oh, that
song is fantastic!
It was amazing progress.
I mean, it was emotional,
it was funny, it was...
It's you.
Oh, do this with me, Will.
Help me take this
show to Broadway.
I'm flattered, but I have
to take the kids to Nationals.
A show choir championship?
Yes.
Will, that's their dream.
Yes, at one point,
it was yours and mine,
but look where that got us.
We're standing on
the exact same stage...
wishing that we could have
done something bigger.
Fondue for Two!
Fondue for Two!
That's some hot dish!
Fondue for Two!
Hi. I'm Brittany.
Welcome to
My guest today was supposed
to be Santana,
but she texted
about an hour ago,
and it just said, "I can't."
So, show must go on.
Um, I will be interviewing
Lord Tubbington.
Question one:
Do you think
is an accurate portrayal
of the feline relationship?
You know, just because
we're doing this interview
doesn't mean
I'm still not mad at you.
'Cause I know
you started smoking again.
Emma, did you wash those grapes
at home?
I just rinsed them.
Yeah, I put the whole bunch
in a colander,
and I just let the cold water
run right over them.
For a half hour or so.
Still, Emma, that's amazing.
I've been, um,
taking my medication
for a couple of weeks.
I'm so proud of you, Emma.
You inspired me, Will--
to make a change,
to take charge
of my own destiny.
And now I want the
same thing for you.
Um, I don't understand.
I snuck in and saw you and April
singing the other day.
You're good, Will.
Really, you have
a gift, you know,
and if April is offering you
the opportunity to use that gift
on the big stage, you have to say yes.
I-I can't see April's show
lighting the town on fire.
Well, but it's a chance,
on a real Broadway stage.
And who knows who's
gonna come and see it,
what great notices you might get.
You deserve to at least try this, Will.
Yeah. I...
I can't do that to the kids.
Not now. We...
We've all worked so hard,
and we're so close.
Ah.
Why are you crying?
The kids.
You.
You all saved my life.
Got me out
of a terrible marriage.
You helped me find
my passion again.
I just don't want to lose you.
But, Emma...
...I want to go so badly.
All right, guys.
Who is up first today?
RACHEL: Signor Schuester,
if it's all right with you,
I'd like to do my own reinterpretation
of my favorite Fleetwood Mac song.
Great, Rachel. Which one?
"Go Your Own Way."
It's the song about the painful breakup
between Lindsay Buckingham
and Stevie Nicks.
Traditionally, it's sung
by a man, but today,
Rachel Berry's gonna put her own
feminine twist on it. Hit it.
Brilliant! Good job, guys.
QUINN: Don't you think
it's maybe a little inappropriate that
you chose to sing a love song to my guy?
You're such a hypocrite!
You Little Miss Perfect Prom Queen!
You're a cheater who cheats
in cheap motels with Sam.
Nothing is going on between Sam and I.
Enough, guys. You know,
I blame Sam for all of this.
And Rachel, too, I blame her.
What did  do?
I'm sure you did something.
See, I'm with Santana.
I mean, why doesn't Sam have anything
to say about this? MIKE: Guilt.
Seriously, dude,
what you're doing is not cool.
- They both have boyfriends.
- Shut up! Look,
I'm not messing around with Quinn
or Kurt or any one of those guys.
- They're just helping me.
- Oh, is  what we're calling it now?
Hold on. How were they helping you out?
Kurt was bringing me
some clothes, and Quinn
was helping me baby-sit my
little brother and sister.
Then why were you in that motel?
Because that's where I live now.
My dad lost his job a few months ago,
then we lost our house, so now we live
in that motel in one room.
Are you all happy?
The truth's finally out.
Thanks for the invite, ladies.
You know what I call an afternoon
where I'm getting drunk?
An afternoon.
Is there protein powder
in this margarita?
And a wee bit of placenta.
Well, I'd like to propose
a toast to Terri Shuester,
who still cares
about her ex-husband
enough to call me up
and encourage me to
ask him for his help.
Mm. It put a hm-mm
in my behind.
But I don't think Will'll
be joining me on the tour.
What? Why? Aw,
he can't leave those kids.
Doesn't know how to break it to 'em.
Blowsy Loads, you leave that to me.
Tomorrow's  will include
the ultimate blind-item
rumor that Will Shuester
is leaving McKinley to
join you on Broadway.
That's not true.
It will be. That's the whole point
of yellow journalism--
turning rumor into fact.
And the hard part--
breaking the news to the
kids-- will be over.
He'll be free to follow his heart
and the stench of your alcohol sweat
to New York City
and out of my life forever.
I don't know. Seems awfully shady.
And I once became an Avon lady
just so I could rob demented seniors.
Let's look at this way-- we all agree
Will Shuester has no business
teaching in a high school.
You believe he's too talented,
and I just hate him.
And I just want our old apartment back.
I'm living in an efficiency
with a raccoon in the wall.
More placenta, anyone?
Um, I'm trying to get
my sister to sleep.
Dude, please, please.
Just let us in.
Hi. I'm Stacy.
Hi, Stacy.
I-I'm Rachel.
This is Finn.
Hi.
Well, she-she's up now.
It beats a cardboard box
underneath an underpass, right?
We keep the rest of our
stuff in my dad's car.
- This is everything you own?
- We sold everything else.
- Can we go watch TV?
- Yeah, sure.
Keep it low, though. Signor Jensen,
next-door, is on the night shift again.
- You want a snack?
- All right.
You, too. Get over there.
I...
I don't understand. What happened?
We moved up here from Tennessee,
you know, 'cause my dad got a great...
job offer, and...
the economy went to hell,
and it's last ones in, first ones out.
You know, we spent all our savings on the
move and the down payment on the house.
You know, when the bank takes your house,
they literally... take it.
They come by one morning
and kick you out of your own house,
just lock you out.
Why didn't you tell
us what was going on?
You see how information flies
around that school, right?
You think everyone would've just treated
me the same, after they found out?
I'd be even more of a freak.
Kurt only found out because...
I got a job delivering pizzas at night
- and happened to bring one to Dalton.
- Yeah...
He told us.
Look, I brought these for you.
I know Kurt was trying
to help you out, bringing...
some of his old clothes, but I don't really
think that sequined riding pants are for you.
So, uh, it's some of my old stuff.
Thanks.
So...
what about...
Quinn?
We go to the same church.
Couldn't really hide it from her, and I kind of like
having her around to do some girl stuff with Stacy.
Mom and Dad are out all day pounding
the pavement looking for work, but...
Nothing.
I'm not sure if I'm gonna be
able to keep on the Glee Club.
What? N-No, you can't do that.
Yeah, we-we've come so far,
and I-I know that it's a rough time
right now, but you can't quit.
You guys don't understand.
Yes, we do.
Quinn told us you hocked your guitar.
Did you guys buy this back for me?
The whole Glee Club did.
Look, Sam, we'll do
whatever we can to help,
anything to keep you in the Glee Club
until you get back on your feet.
First time I've cried.
Don't cry, Sammy.
We need you, Sam.
Ok? And you need the music.
Any comment on the vicious rumor
left on the  website
about you and Karofsky
doing it in the backseat
of a parked car in the
Holier Than Thou Cemetery?
No comment.
Any comment on the fact when I looked up the I.
P. address of the person who posted the rumor
I found out it was you?
My computer was stolen.
Look, all I can say is that
Dave and I are going strong,
and we're very excited about our
Prom King and Queen campaign.
- Vote Santofsky.
- So you two are in love?
Soul mates, so to speak?
Yeah.
I'd say that was accurate.
All right,
Mr. Shue, is this true?
Yeah, the  says you're
bailing on us to do April Rhodes' big show.
Guys...
if there's anything we've learned from this week's assignment,
it's that you can't believe every rumor you hear.
But isn't it your dream
to sing on Broadway?
I have a lot of dreams.
My top one...
being taking you guys
to Nationals.
- So you're gonna stay?
- Look, we are going to Nationals, together,
and we are going to win.
Hey, everybody.
Kind of wanted to get these guys out of the motel for
a little while-- I hope it's ok if I brought them.
- Of course, of course. Yeah, come on in.
- I was also hoping that maybe...
they could help out with a number today.
I have the perfect song
I want to sing to them,
and don't worry, it's good
for the assignment, Mr. Shue.
The more the merrier.
"Don't stop" by Fleetwood Mac
Don't... stop
Don't... stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop
Don't... stop
Don't... stop
Stop, stop, stop, stop...
If you wake up
and don't want to smile
If it takes
just a little while
Open your eyes
And look at the day
You'll see things
in a different way
Don't
Stop
Thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop
It'll soon be here
It'll be
Better than before
Yesterday's gone
Yesterday's gone
All I want is
to see you smile
If it takes
just a little while
I know you don't
believe that it's true
I never meant
any harm to you
Don't stop
Oh...
Thinking about tomorrow
Don't... stop
Don't... stop
It'll soon be here
It'll be
Better than before
Yesterday's gone
Yesterday's gone
Don't you look back
Don't you look,
don't you look, no
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't you look back
Don't you look back
Don't you look back
Don't you look back
Don't, don't,
don't you look back
Don't... stop
Don't... stop
Thinking about tomorrow.
