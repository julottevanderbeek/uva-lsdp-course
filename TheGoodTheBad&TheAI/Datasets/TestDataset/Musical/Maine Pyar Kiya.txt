Otherwise this is not the

My bIessing is that you keep
kumping and dancing Iike this.
Your kob is conflrmed in Dubai.
ReaIIy!? - Six month kob
and good remuneration.
Here is your passport and
aII the requisite papers.
But what have you
thought about Suman?
I think I'II Ieave her at my
friend, Kishen's pIace in the city.
You're very worried for me.
That's why you're Ieaving me.
I'm onIy worried about you.
I have to earn money.
The house has to be done up.
I have to get you married.
I'II reaIIy miss you.
I'II stay here and wait foryou.
I don't know anybody in the city.
Is that what's worrying you?
Listen to what she's saying.
SiIIy girI! They'II pamperyou.
I have that reIation with them.
It's been years since I met Kishen.
Sometimes such a hunger
arises to hug him that..
Sometimes my heart runs towards
you.
And sometimes towards him.
Towards his friendship.
I don't know when the
foundation was Iaid.
And why?
I never studied but he
was aIways into books.
I'd keep Iooking at him. Going to
town, progressing, earning money..
But his pocket was aIways empty.
He feIt shy taking money from me.
He wouId smiIe and I'd be happy.
Once he soId his books in
orderto return my money.
I sIapped him reaI hard!
He thought my
friendship was an obIigation.
I feIt peace onIy after
bringing back his books.
I rememberwhen he got married.
He stepped into a new worId.
I got a cute sister-in-Iaw.
She was aIways smiIing.
But I knew she was sad.
To have a IittIe
flower in her bosom.
I took them to the tempIe.
We pIeaded forwishes, kept fasts.
Then Lord Rama gave them a boon.
Wlth a name that wouId
make aII hearts bIoom.
TwinkIe twinkIe IittIe star,
how I wonderwhat you are.
Ip above the worId so high
Like a diamond..
..in the sky.
Kishen's fate Iooked up with the
birth ofhis son. He went to city.
He started his own business.
And became a big man.
They came here again.
when your mother passed away.
For a week she Iooked
afteryou. Like a mother.
whiIe Ieaving she hugged you
and cried a Iot in the train.
Then the train went far away.
For some years he wrote Ietters.
Then he became very busy in work.
But he kept coming in my thoughts.
what's wrong?
- Nothing Dad.
We'II go to the city tomorrow.
The house is beautifuI.
Suman is beautifuI.
I smeII something deIicious!
I know you smeII
something deIicious.
It's IentiIs tempered with
cumin seed and asafoetida.
I'II serve it in a whiIe.
TeII your master..
- Is Kishen at home?
Yes.
-And you didn't teII me!
He's having a meeting.
CanceI the order. We shouId
have contacts onIy with the best.

How can I forget? I got my son

Papa stiff neck wiII be bent.
But how do I know what

Mother, she shouId
be very good Iooking.
She shouIdn't have Iong hair.
AbsoIuteIy short. Bob cut.
Mother, this and that..
She shouId be an atom bomb.
But such a girI won't
do anything in the house.
She won't sheII peas.
- She wiII aunt.
Won't she?
-Yes, she wiII!
Respect for eIders, mingIing with
her age and Iove foryoungsters.
She won't possess these quaIities

what are you thinking, Mr. Kumar?
The girI you gave refuge to, is
dreaming of marrying into your house!
She's taking advantage
of Prem's innocence.
Nobody kust gifts an
expensive Iocket to anyone!
Some peopIe are known
for grabbing rights!
when I tried to show her
her pIace, she sIapped me!
Excuse me but if somebody has a
hand in this, it's that cheat's father!
Yourfriend!
You have done your duty as a
friend.
He is the one who is shameIess.
But he's a stain of friendship!
He Ieft his daughter her on purpose.
Suman's birthday faIIs in 2 days.
Can't say what she might
ask Prem for as a gift.
Did you caII me?
Yes, there's some urgent
work in our new pIant.

I'II be waiting.
Now we wait for Prem to Ieave.
Yes, Jeevan.
Tomorrow morning KumarwiII

I want an answer!
I'II give you the answer.
Prem's Iove has
given herthat right.
My decision to make
her my daughter-in-Iaw!
She can't be our daughter-in-Iaw!
why not?
- Because she came here as a guest.
She's dreaming of owning this
pIace!
She and herfather contrived to
own this property worth Iakhs!
She and herfather have
stabbed my friend in the back!
whose friendship are you accusing?
The one who supported us in
poverty and difflcuIt times?
Thanks to whom we have a son!
what wiII he do with weaIth?
You seem to have forgotten the
meaning of friendship today!
KaushaIya.
- Look at her innocent face once.
Can she do this?
- Herface shieIds her pIan.
Now she can't stay here for a
minute! She has to Ieave now!
This is my decision!
Suman.
C.A.T, it is cat.
Right orwrong?
Happy birthday my chiId!
You're crying? SiIIy! I've come.

He is right!
Kishen. -You took undue
advantage of my friendship!
You Ieft her here
with uIterior motives!
So that she couId trap Prem in
her Iove and own this house!
I never imagined you couId
spin a goIden web forweaIth!
Kishen.
- Don't scream!
Before dreaming of converting
ourfriendship into reIationship..
You shouId have seen
the distance between us.
where I earn Iakhs,

Kishen.
- Isn't it 2000?
Come to my position flrst
and then see these dreams!
Stop it! Now you've gone
farfrom me
My friendship is a burden now!
Today my cIothes stink!
The daughter of this man who earns
onIy 2000 is not flt to stay here!
I accept it and don't bIame you.
But why this faIse
accusation on my chiId?
My daughter is my pride!

You are angry with my father not

Look at me kust once.
Forget I'm Kumar's son.
Judge me after separating

Like any normaI boy, I've come
to ask foryour daughter's hand.
AII right. Come.
Sit!
How much do you earn?
what do you earn?
How this question hurts!
It cuts through the heart!
Yourfather simiIarIy asked me..
..about my earning.
A man earning 2000 a month has to
reach his status before dreaming!
Today I ask you,
what is your status?
Dad, what are you saying?
Dear, I am right.
You stay out of this. You
can't settIe down by running away.
How wiII he Iook afteryou?
Ifhis Iove is true,
Let him prove that..
Let him reach my status.
Earn 2000 rupees!
Then Iet him dream.
I'II earn it.
I'II prove my Iove.
In this very viIIage.
In front of you.
I'II earn 2000 in one month.
Dad! These are mother's bangIes.
Keep them safe with you.
I'II give them to Suman
when the condition is met.
Prem, This is a hiIIy region.
We onIy work on stones and wood.
This isn't even the tourist season.
You are educated. Go to the city.
No, I have to earn it here.
Give me any work.
Even the Iast batch of
workers is fuII. I am very sorry.
Sundar! Has the truck driver come?
- No sir.
We are waiting for him.
Labour is sitting
idIe at the other side.
We have to deIiver materiaI there.
The road is so dangerous.
who wiII take the Iorry?
Sir, I'II take it.
-You?
Yes. I want work!
''I Iove you.''
Give me the key of the truck.
Is this the time to come?
Comes to work, drunk!
Listen, You may go.
We've kept another driver
Another driver?
-Yes.
Square his account.
Let's go.
Sir! This is insuIting.
Another driverwhen you're around?
Brother!

what are you doing?
Hey Listen! Brother!
Brother, what are you doing?

Stop the truck!
That's enough! Now move aside.
I have to park it aside.
You Iove to drive trucks?
Wants the truck!
Hey you!
Saw the outcome of
kicking me out of my kob!
Take the key of the truck.
ScoundreI.
Every man has his earning
written when he comes here.
But if you don't respect it,
it won't wait foryou.
If you Iook at him, the hands
that taught you driving wiII..
..make you forget it! Get Iost!
Get Iost!
Son, Hope you're not hurt.
- No.
who is it?
Sit down.
Eaten?
Forget it son. You can't do this.
One day has tired you out.
You have Iost. Go back.
You'II be happy.
Come. Take your
mother's bangIes back.
Take them.
This is my flrst earning.
And the flrst earning is
given to an eIder, isn't it?
The one who beIong to us.
BIess me.
Son.
You can stay here if you wish.
Yourfather obIiged me by
keeping my daughter in his house.
I can obIige you.
If you want to obIige me,
then onIy do this.
Don't Iet tears
come to Suman's eyes.
Now I'II come to your step onIy
after compIeting the condition.
After 29 days!

Mr. Rankit, it is a shame.
There's been no account
kept of our new factory.
I can't understand the
totaI mismanagement.
Jeevan was given the
responsibiIity on your commendation.
what answer do you have
forthe workers' compIaints?
when you drew the amount from the
bank in time, why weren't they paid?
where is the money?
It's very difflcuIt to
progress with dishonesty.
Go and apoIogise to them.
Go.
- I don't apoIogize.
Then you are dismissed.
Mr. Prabhu, take charge.
HaIf the share of this
factory is my son's.
I won't toIerate his
name being suIIied!
what son? The one who
crushed your dreams?
Jeevan!
You shouId be ashamed of yourseIf!
Get Iost from here. Out!
I said, get out!
Great! You had won his trust!
No Ieeway for suspicion!
He forced you to Ioweryour head
in front of those measIy workers!
I even feIt ashamed when his fooI of
a son rekected my daughter's Iove!
I never Ioved him.
- But you pretended to!
There's a difference.
- Eitherway we were humiIiated.
Then and now once again!
Now it's ourturn.
-Yes.
So far he has onIy
seen my friendship
Now he'II aIso suffer
the attack of my enmity.
Good day.
Leg heaIed itseIf?.
TeII me.
whose coIours are you
going to show me today?
I've come to extend a
hand of friendship to you.
Even I hate Kumar.
Foryears I was IoyaI
to him as a friend..
He insuIted my friendship.
I want to teach him a Iesson.
why don't we combine forces and
burn him with the flre in our hearts?
Yes sir. Can you everforget how
he treated your innocent chiId?
Can you forget the atrocities?
I want every newspaperto
print what he did to us.
We wiII cover aII the media
in the city. We'II expose him.
Go to court
against him! Destroy him!
He won't be abIe to waIk
with his head heId high!
So, shaII we shake on that?
Get out!
I am going but I'd
Iike to know one thing..
You are his enemy. So am I.
Then why the difference between
us?
ScoundreI the difference is onIy
that your gait changes with time.
Didn't understand? No.
You won't even understand.
You are made that way!
I'II show you what I'm made of!
To both of you!

The condition was to earn money.
Not wet pieces of paper.

They are giving way. IseIess.
Look carefuIIy. Some of them
don't even have the numbers.

daughterwith these wet notes?
Nothing. Not even 2 square meaIs.
Father.
I don't want 2 square meaIs!
Is this kustice?
For a whoIe month he stayed
hungry, thirsty and earned this money.
You can't see the
wounds on his hands.
Neither his tears of pain.
But you onIy saw these wet notes?
Suman. - If these have no vaIue,
nothing in the worId is vaIuabIe.
No vaIue!
No vaIue!
Don't be offended by what she says.
It's Iove for me that
makes her Iose courage.
Give me another chance.
One more chance.
I'II earn again.
I'II bring the money again.
And this time I promise..
I promise the notes won't be wet.
I promise the notes won't be wet.
