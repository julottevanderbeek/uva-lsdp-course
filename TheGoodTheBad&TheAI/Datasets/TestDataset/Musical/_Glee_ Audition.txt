So, here's what you missed
last season on Glee.
Quinn had a baby,
Finn and Rachel are in love,
Sue's going easy on Will,
and even though the Glee Club
worked really hard to get
to Regionals, they didn't win.
Vocal Adrenaline!
But it's okay
to not win an award,
particularly when you had so
much fun getting there, right?
We didn't even place.
And that's what
you missed on Glee.
Up here. Come on, focus.
Okay.
Hi, I'm Jacob Ben Israel
with Glee's Big Gay Summer,
with all the Glee Club dish
you're dying to know.
Rachel, how do you
respond to rumors
you're incredibly difficult
to work with?
Well, as her boyfriend,
I can answer that.
We've been dating all summer.
Rachel's what you'd call
a controllist.
I-I'm controlling.
"Controllist" isn't a word.
Oh.
I'm controlling.
Performing is my life.
And yes, do I have
opinions about it?
Does my need to constantly
express those opinions
annoy my fellow Glee Clubbers?
Yes.
That was out loud, wasn't it?
Will Schuester, how do you
respond to a recent post
on my blog saying
your Glee Club song selections
sound like they come from
a drag queen's iPod?
Well, I try to do
something for everybody.
Uh, 25% show tunes, 25%
hip-hop, 25% classic rock...
that because you knocked up
Quinn Fabray,
you spent all your summer pool
cleaning money on a vasectomy.
It's true.
It was the responsible
thing to do.
Is it also true you're suffering
from a crippling depression
because you're
not over Miss Fabray?
How has life changed since
the birth of your bastard child?
Well, I'm happy to be
back, and I'm ready
to start fresh.
And... I'm a lot less hormonal,
so... so there's not
really any crying.
How was your summer?
My eyes are up here, JewFro.
And it was uneventful.
People thought I
went on vacation,
but actually I spent the
summer lost in the sewers.
about the rumors
the two of you are dating?
Because we're both Asian?
That's racist.
Totally racist.
Did you get that?
Did you get that?
You saw it here first.
Did you know there's
a forum on my blog
that's begging you
to stop rapping?
Wait, th-the kids
don't like it when I rap?
accept the fact
that people hate you
Kiss it, Jacob.
And think you're nothing
but a glorified karaoke club
Go away, go away.
Designed to make the inventors
of AutoTune millions of dollars?
When exactly did you ink your
sponsorship with Lands' End?
to make your triumphant return
to the Shire?
How do you get
the white on rice?
What did you do with
all that breast milk?
You know what, Jacob?
It doesn't take much
courage for people
to park their cottage cheese
behinds in their Barcaloungers
and log on to the Internet
and start tearing
people down, does it?
But you know what does
take some courage?
Standing up and singing
about something.
So here's a message for
everyone that reads your blog.
Next time, instead of posting
an anonymous comment online,
say what you have
to say to my face.
Welcome back, lady!
Whoo!
I don't suppose there's
any way you could just
cut out that last
part, is there?
Mm-mm.
Hey, why so glum, William?
Cat crap in your coffee?
Or are you worried no one's
signing up for
your little club there?
Nah, not at all, Sue.
Nationals are
in New York City this year.
I think that list is
gonna be filled up in no time.
Well, you know what
your problem is?
"No tryouts,
just sign up."
Nobody wants to be
part of a club that
just anyone can join.
See this?
It's a court summons...
child endangerment...
'cause there's been a
line of would-be Cheerios!
Out there since late July.
I guess they lost their
humanity a little bit.
One girl ate a pigeon,
several others
started worshiping a possum
carcass as their lord.
That's how much they
want to be Cheerios!
Well, sorry, Sue.
Anyone who wants to join
Glee Club gets to join.
Oh, God, Will, let me
break it down for you.
High school is a dry run
for the rest of your life.
Not everyone can be champions.
Not everyone should
be champions.
We need fry cooks
and bus drivers.
Well, Sue, it's how I work,
and it's not going to change.
I like being friends
with you, Will.
This is fun.
You make not trying to
destroy Glee Club easy.
You know why?
'Cause you're doing such
a bang-up job of it
all by yourself.
Oh, it's time to feed my gimp.
Oh, and also,
Figgins wants to see us.
Ah-ah-ah! Not you!
Hands off that list.
Cut my budget?
You can't cut my budget
without written consent
from the President
of the Federal Reserve!
It's in my contract!
Oh, Sue, I think you can manage
a sixth national title
without two confetti cannons.
Do you think your kids can
manage life without their daddy?
We're barely surviving
on the budget we have.
Slashing the Glee budget
by ten percent,
cutting our transportation
to and from events
is like cutting our legs off.
Sacrifices must be made.
This is being mandated
at the district level, guys.
Studies show that the best way
to bring in alumni donations
is through a successful
athletic department...
Specifically,
a winning football team.
Who's this?
I'm Shannon Beiste;
I'm the new football coach.
Spelled B-E-I-S-T-E.
- It's French.
- I'm sorry,
what happened to Ken Tanaka?
Nervous breakdown.
Don't look at it
as a punishment,
look at it as an investment
into your clubs' futures.
The more money
the football program
brings in, the more I can
give back to you guys!
Coach Beiste here
is fresh off
her fifth consecutive
all-Missouri high school
football championship.
We're very lucky to have her!
What can I say?
I like a challenge.
First of all,
a female football coach,
like a male nurse...
Sin against nature.
Number two, I'm sure you're
used to Hillbilly parents
yelping adulation at
you as they attempt
to impregnate the tailpipes
of various off-road vehicles.
But you're in my
house now, Beiste.
No one comes into my
house and steals from me.
Do not get up
in a panther's business, lady.
You're all coffee
and no omelet.
That doesn't make any sense.
Coach, uh, Beiste, I-I think you
understand our frustration.
Our budgets just got
cut by ten percent.
It should have been more!
You think there's not
something wrong when
the cheerleaders' budget's
higher than the people
who they're cheering for?
Well, sure, but the
Glee Club is a...
The Glee Club?
You came in third last year
and you're asking
for more money?
That's a steer with
six teats and no oink.
This doesn't make any sense.
What?
These are comments
from Jacob Ben-Israel's
most recent Glee Club blog.
"Glee is a giant ball of suck."
We get it, Mr. Shue.
Everyone still hates us.
So what? So we're plankton
on the high school food chain?
Only difference now
is that none of us really care.
Kurt's right. We're a family.
They can bring it all they want.
None of it is going
to break us.
Okay, I'm really happy
that you guys have all bonded.
The problem is that
all of this negative stuff
is keeping other students
from auditioning.
Good.
Why do we need new members?
Well, since Matt transferred,
we only have 11 members,
and if we want to
go to Nationals,
if we want to beat
Vocal Adrenaline,
we have to go from
a small rebel force
to a giant wall of sound.
Yeah, Mr. Schuester's
right, you guys.
You didn't see Vocal Adrenaline
at Regionals. They were epic.
We're going to need more voices
in order to beat them.
Yeah. I'm with Rachel
on this one.
Gross.
You're going to have to
trust me on this, guys.
Now, here's the plan.
Nationals are in
New York this year,
and we are going.
Now let's go out there
and show the school how
cool it's going to be,
how cool we can be.
If they're not going to come
to us, let's go to them.
They say we only sing
show tunes and '8os pop.
Let's show them how down we are.
Let's give them the
song of the year,
New Directions! style.
Okay.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Yeah!

Hey, Sue. Can I talk
to you for a second?
Sure, buddy. You look steamed.
Those kids went out and
really tried to show
what Glee Club was all about.
And how does
the school repay them?
By defacing the sign-up sheet.
"Buttface McBallnuts."
"Ass-braham Lin-colon."
They're not even funny!
Now, don't be rude, William. I
put a lot of thought into those.
Consider this a wakeup call.
You're worried about
getting new recruits?
Well, if Beiste get her way
and our budgets are slashed,
you'll be cutting kids
left and right.
You're right.
I hadn't thought about that.
Beiste needs to be stopped, and
I need your help to topple her.
You in?
I'm in.
about my Glee Club recruit
poster design.
I made it super masculine,
just like these pamphlets I saw
some Army guys passing out
at a daycare center.
¶¶ We both lie silent and still
in the dead of the night ¶¶
¶¶ Although we lie close
together ¶¶
¶¶ I feel like
we're miles apart... ¶¶
It was this new transfer kid.
I saw him tapping his foot
when we busted it out
in the courtyard the day
before...
¶¶ Every rose has its thorn ¶¶
¶¶ Just like every night
has its dawn ¶¶
I would've joined in
with a kick-ass harmony,
¶¶ Just like every cowboy sings
a sad, sad song... ¶¶.
Oh, hello!
I couldn't help
but notice you
admiring me
yesterday in
the courtyard.
Um, what?
Oh, you don't speak English.
You like me sing!
You like me sing very much!
Um, I totally speak English.
I even did
a little research on you.
You're a foreign exchange
student
named Sunshine Corazon
because you're from
the Philippines,
where it's sunny every day.
Except for the monsoons.
Listen, Sunshine,
we need chorus members;
People to stand behind me
and stare at me
with wet, moved eyes
while I sing solos.
So I encourage you
to audition for Glee Club!
Glee Club is fun!
Swaying in background
can be fun!
Thank you.
Okay.
¶¶ Hello, hello, baby, you
called, I can't hear a thing ¶¶
¶¶ I have got no service
in the club, you say, say? ¶¶
¶¶ Wha-wha-what did you say?
Oh, you're breaking up on me ¶¶
¶¶ Sorry, I cannot hear you,
I'm kinda busy ¶¶
¶¶ K-kinda busy ¶¶
¶¶ K-kinda busy ¶¶
¶¶ Sorry, I cannot hear you,
I'm kinda busy ¶¶
¶¶ Just a second,
it's my favorite song
¶¶ They're gonna play ¶¶
¶¶ And I cannot text you
with a drink in my hand, eh? ¶¶
¶¶ You shoulda made some plans
with me ¶¶
¶¶ You knew that I was free ¶¶
¶¶ And now you won't stop calling
me, I'm kinda busy ¶¶
¶¶ Stop callin', stop callin',
I don't wanna think anymore! ¶¶
¶¶ I left my head and my heart on
the dance floor ¶¶
¶¶ Stop callin', stop callin',
I don't wanna talk anymore! ¶¶
¶¶ I left my head and my heart on
the dance floor ¶¶
¶¶ Stop telephoning me! ¶¶
¶¶ I'm being... ¶¶.
Shut up!
That was fun.
I'd love to join your club.
When are auditions?
Let me get back
to you on that one.
Don't tell anyone
about this, okay?
Okay.
We're trying to recruit
new members for Glee Club.
The Panther isn't cool
with anything
except doing exactly
what she says without question.
That's how you win.
Now, first things first.
You're all cut.
Everyone starts fresh with me.
Tryouts start...
Right now.
Any questions?
I got 25
everything pies for a Coach...
Beiste?
I didn't order any pizzas.
Isn't this kind of immature?
No, it's downright childish.
But I know gals like Beiste.
Oh, her high school life
must have been miserable.
She's oversized, humorless,
refers to herself in the
third person as an animal.
This kind of abuse and teasing
will bring back all
those childhood memories.
She'll be shaken to her core.
Humiliated and devastated.
She'll have no choice
but to quit her job,
and our budgets
will be restored.
Yes!
The boss says, uh,
if you don't pay
for 'em, I have to.
Which means we have
to reuse my kid's Pampers.
For another week.
Hand 'em out, Wayne Newton.
All right, guys,
it's a pizza party.
Dig in.
Everybody has to eat
at least four slices.
Let's go!
And when you're done,
full pads out on the field.
We're doing wind sprints.
And the first ten
to puke are off the team.
Hey, guys, um, there's pizza
in there, if you want some.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I figured that if Kurt's
gay and he can do it,
then why can't I?
Being gay isn't
a handicap, Artie.
How can you play football
in a wheelchair, anyway?
I have to get
on that team, Finn.
Dude, what's this about?
Tina.
She dumped me for Mike Chang.
They fell in love over
the summer at... Asian Camp.
They were counselors,
in charge of teaching
all those tech-savvy Asian kids
about the arts.
¶¶ Getting to know
all about you ¶¶
¶¶ Getting to like you... ¶¶.
So, what did Tina say
when she broke up with you?
I think you're great, Artie,
but you're a terrible boyfriend.
You ignored me for
weeks this summer.
I was playing a marathon
round of Halo, woman.
And then when we
did get together,
all you wanted to do was watch
Coming Home over and over.
Mike tries to be
into what I'm into.
Like his abs.
Dude, I'm sympathetic for you;
I just don't see you
on the football team.
Imagine you were pushing me
in this big hunk of metal
down the field at full speed.
The centrifugal force
would be too much to stop.
I'd be like a medieval
battering ram.
Dude, you'd be like
a human cannonball.
That would be awesome!
So you'll help?
Sure. But you got
to help me first.
Hey, Sam.
My name's Finn.
This here is Artie.
Yeah, I know who you are.
You're the... the quarterback.
Exactly... which
makes me very cool.
And we'd like to talk
to you about Glee Club.
So, Sam, tell us
about yourself.
My name's Sam Evans.
I like comic books,
sports.
I'm dyslexic, so my grades
aren't that good, but...
I'm working on it.
Dude, your mouth is huge.
How many tennis balls
can you fit in there?
I don't... know. I've never
had any balls in my mouth.
Have you?
I like this kid.
I like his confidence,
but the Bieber cut's gotta go.
Mm-hmm.
So, can you sing
with that big mouth?
I've never really sung
in front of anybody before.
Dude, let me tell you,
chicks dig singers.
Well, give it a shot.
We'll back you up, I promise.
What song you got
in your back pocket?
Um... "Billionaire"?
¶¶ I wanna be a billionaire ¶¶
¶¶ So freakin' bad ¶¶
¶¶ Buy all of the things
I never had ¶¶
¶¶ I wanna be on the cover of ¶¶
¶¶ Smiling next to Oprah
and the Queen ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, every time I close ¶¶
¶¶ My eyes ¶¶
¶¶ I see my name
in shining lights ¶¶
¶¶ Yeah ¶¶
¶¶ A different city every night ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, I ¶¶
¶¶ I swear ¶¶
¶¶ The world better prepare ¶¶
¶¶ For when I'm a billionaire ¶¶
¶¶ Yeah, I would have
a show like Oprah ¶¶
¶¶ I would be the host of ¶¶
¶¶ Every day Christmas ¶¶
¶¶ Give Artie a wish list ¶¶
¶¶ I'll probably pull
a Angelina and Brad Pitt ¶¶
¶¶ And adopt a bunch of babies
that ain't never had it ¶¶
¶¶ Give away a few Mercedes
like, "Here, lady, have this" ¶¶
¶¶ And last but not least,
grant somebody their last wish ¶¶
¶¶ It's been a couple months
that I been single, so ¶¶
¶¶ You can call me Artie Claus,
minus the ho-ho ¶¶
¶¶ Ha-ha! Get it? I'll probably
visit where Katrina hit ¶¶
¶¶ And darn sure do
a lot more than FEMA did ¶¶
¶¶ Yeah, can't forget
about me, stupid ¶¶
¶¶ Everywhere I go,
I'm-a have my own theme music ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, every time
I close my eyes ¶¶
¶¶ Uh, what you see,
what you see, bruh? ¶¶
¶¶ I see my name
in shining lights ¶¶
¶¶ Uh-huh, uh-huh,
and what else? ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, yeah ¶¶
¶¶ A different city every night ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, I, I swear ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah ¶¶
¶¶ World better prepare ¶¶
¶¶ For what? ¶¶
¶¶ For when I'm a billionaire ¶¶
¶¶ Oh! ¶¶
¶¶ When I'm a billionaire ¶¶
¶¶ Sing it! ¶¶
¶¶ When I'm a billionaire ¶¶
¶¶ Oh! ¶¶
¶¶ I wanna be a billionaire ¶¶
¶¶ So freakin' bad. ¶¶.
That-that was really cool!
Nice. So you think
you can come back
and do that
in front of everybody?
Sure.
So, is that a men's sweater?
Fashion has no gender.
Ladies, we have a problem.
There's a new student
at this school
named Sunshine who is a Filipino
and is shorter than me.
Which I didn't think
was possible and
is very unnerving.
Okay, so I'm gonna go now.
Wait!
And...
She has a remarkable voice.
I'm just...
I'm very worried.
You know, not-not for myself,
but for my lesser Glee Clubbers
who don't get as many solos.
So I've paid a hundred dollars
to Azimio and Karofsky
to brutally slushie us
in front of Sunshine's locker,
terrifying her and ensuring
she doesn't sign up.
Okay, so this is the part
where you're supposed to be
hugging me and thanking me.
That's awful. You're awful.
But solos! I mean...
Look, Rachel, Mercedes and I
are about as self-involved
as they come, but
more than anything,
we want to beat
Vocal Adrenaline.
And if there's someone
at the school that
can help us do that,
they're in.
You know what?
You're right.
It's just...
So like me to just be
totally blinded by my concern
for the two of you.
I'll-I'll-I'll go talk
to Sunshine now
and just let her know
how truly welcome she really is.
Thanks.
Hi.
So, here's the address
for the audition tomorrow
and helpful directions.
Look forward
to seeing you there.
Thanks.
Beiste is on the move.
Operation Mean Girl is a go.
Move. Go! Disperse.
Leave the Danish.
Anyone sitting here?
Yes.
These seats are currently being
occupied by my ghost friends.
I beg your pardon?
My ghost friends.
Hideous, lonely faculty members
who met with an early death
from good old-fashioned
schoolyard bullying.
And you know why?
They tried to cross me.
So why don't you
just keep on walking?
Hi, Will.
You... you mind
if I sit here?
Uh... sorry.
Taken.
How about there?
Actually, they're all
sort of taken.
I am, uh, meeting with some...
Some science teachers.
You think it's easy being
a female football coach,
being different?
You think I don't get this
everywhere I go?
Everybody told me
that Sue was the school bully
and, uh...
That you were really cool.
I see they got that last part
wrong, huh?
So you know why Helen
Keller couldn't drive, right?
Why?
'Cause she was a woman.
Coach Beiste?
Are you crying?
Yeah.
Saw your stats from last season,
and it really hurt my feelings.
Hey, Coach, uh, this is Artie.
He'd like to try out
for the team.
You screwing with me?
No, no. Absolutely not.
Uh, see we figured that
if I push him down the field
fast enough, the centrifugal...
Centrifugal.
Centrifugal force.
You're out.
Wait. What?!
You're off the team, cut, out!
You come in here,
pushing a kid in a wheelchair,
making me look like
some kind of monster
because I have
to tell him he can't play?
No. No, that's not
what was going
on here. Artie?
I really want to play.
I want my girlfriend back,
and I want abs.
Yeah, he's like
a human battering ram,
like, like,
Braveheart.
You know what?
I don't like being screwed with!
Do you understand me?
Dude, you're
totally overreacting.
Dude?
Get the hell out
of my locker room!
Go!
Think this is some joke?
Go!
Next!
No way. Get out.
Coach Sylvester,
please hear me out.
Nope. I trusted you,
and you let me down.
I don't want you
anywhere near my squad.
You'll deafen them
with the sound
of your stretch marks
rubbing together.
I understand you had your
confetti cannons taken away.
Well, I'll bet
there are quite a few
church groups
who would gladly give money
to a squad
who helped rehabilitate
a girl who got pregnant
and now speaks out
for abstinence education
while wearing
a Cheerios! uniform.
Next!
Oh, my gosh, Coach.
Wait. You're serious? Finn?
My eyes are still burning.
I'm Finn Hudson,
and I'd like
to audition for the Cheerios!
¶¶ I've got the power ¶¶
¶¶ Power ¶¶
¶¶ I've got the power ¶¶
¶¶ Power ¶¶.
Am I dreaming?
¶¶ I've got the power... ¶¶.
Is this happening?
But... why?
Coach Beiste kicked me off
the football team.
I'm not the quarterback anymore,
which... means I'm nothing.
I miss being popular.
This is really embarrassing.
I have really great
leadership skills,
and, uh, I'm athletic,
so I could help
with the lifts and stuff.
I hope you'll consider me.
Why would he get kicked off
the football team?
Finn was just trying to help out
his handicapable friend!
He was insubordinate twice.
I'm the captain
of the USS Kick Ass,
Please, Coach,
don't do this to me.
I need football. It's who I am.
I thought you were the Glee guy.
I mean, what with all
the sign-up sheets you put
in my locker room.
Finn is a really good kid.
Give him a chance to show you.
You mean don't make a
snap judgment about him?
Don't make his life miserable
because I assume
he's a certain way?
Okay, I get it.
This is about me.
I haven't been very welcoming,
but please, please,
don't take this out on Finn.
Am I through here,
Principal Figgins?
Mm-hmm.
A little bird told me
that someone spent
her summer vacation
getting a brand-new set
of melons,
even though you know
I have a very strict
no plastics policy in Cheerios!
Care to comment?
I just...
What would possess a person
your age to get a boob job?
You don't even know what
your body's going to look like.
It's an insult to nature
and completely distracting.
I can't take my eyes off them.
I'm actually talking to them
right now.
I wanted people
to notice me more.
I don't get
what the big deal is.
Well, the big deal is
that a person
who has to pump her nonnies
full of gravy
to feel good about herself
clearly doesn't have
the self-esteem
to be my head cheerleader.
Quinn will replace you.
What did...?
Oh, and Boobs McGee?
You're demoted
to the bottom of the pyramid,
so when it collapses,
your exploding
sandbags will protect the squad
from injury.
Now take your juicy,
vine-ripened chest fruit
and get the hell
out of my office.
You did this to me.
You told Coach Sylvester
about my summer surgery!
You have a surgery when
you get your appendix out.
You got a boob job.
Yup, sure did.
You can't hit me.
Oh, sure I can, unless you got
yourself knocked up again, slut.
Stop the violence.
Hey, hey, what is this?!
Stop it.
What happened
to us being a family? Hey.
Oh, please.
Stop that.
She has a family.
She's a mother.
Walk away.
Hey!
And tighten up your pony
before you get to class!
Well, hate to break it to you,
but it doesn't look like
anyone's gonna be joining us,
so I think we should
just call it a day.
We said 3:00 to 5:00.
It's only 4:58.
Just wait. My buddy
Sam's gonna try out.
He totally idolizes me.
Oh, face it, Finn.
You're no longer
the quarterback.
You're not
the Pied Piper anymore.
No one's gonna
follow you around
thinking everything
you do is cool.
What about that Sunshine girl?
I thought you said
she could sing.
I guess she didn't want
to hang out with us losers.
Show us on the doll
where Coach Beiste touched you.
Here and here.
This is outrageous.
I'll say.
Anyone who would prey on someone
as sweet and simple
as poor, poor Brittany
deserves everything
that's coming to her.
I suggest immediate termination
and entry into the statewide
sex offender database.
Sorry I'm late.
What's going on?
Brittany here
has accused Coach Beiste
of inappropriate touching.
What?! Brittany, that's
a serious accusation.
It's very serious.
Brittany, what you're saying
could ruin somebody's life.
It's really important that
you tell the truth here.
I made it up.
Coach Beiste
didn't touch my boobs.
Actually, I really want
to touch her boobs.
If you're all done
wasting my time,
I have a football team to coach.
Coach...
You're weak, Will!
- You know what, Sue?
- Mr. Shue?
Can we talk to you?
It's kind of important.
Tell me this isn't true, Rachel.
She could have died.
I didn't send her to
an active crack house.
Besides, how did you guys
find out anyways?
The Asian
community is
very tight.
I just don't get it.
You're better than this.
No, she's an ambitious
little freak
who will do anything
to hold on to her power.
I just... I...
I love you guys so much.
I was wrong before.
I don't want any
new members.
I didn't want anyone coming in
and-and messing up
our group dynamic.
Tina, Mike,
I mean,
what if Sunshine can dance?
Then your contributions to Glee
will be even more insignificant
than they already are now.
I did this for you guys.
Whatever your motivations,
you need
to make this right, Rachel.
I'm sorry for sending you
to that crack house.
They stole my sheet music
and used it for toilet paper.
Look, I'll buy you a new set.
You can just, um,
come pick it up
at the auditorium
at 4:00 tomorrow.
Hi, I'm Sunshine Corazon,
and I'll be singing "Listen"
Broadway show first.
Shh...
Shut up.
¶¶ Listen ¶¶
¶¶ To the song here in my heart ¶¶
¶¶ A melody I start ¶¶
¶¶ But can't complete ¶¶
¶¶ Listen ¶¶
¶¶ To the sound
from deep within ¶¶
¶¶ It's only beginning ¶¶
¶¶ To find release ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, the time has come ¶¶

Bravo!
Wow.
Um...
Welcome to the Glee Club.
Thank you.
Amazing.
Thank you.
Do you mind if I join you?
Okay.
Look, I really owe you
an apology.
I guess I kicked this year off
thinking that all of us
in the Glee Club weren't
outcasts anymore,
and I thought
we'd be turning kids away.
And then when no one
signed up for the club,
I realized that we were still
at the bottom... outsiders.
And that's how I made you feel.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
William, Beiste,
I wanted to make a peace
offering with a batch of
warm, homemade cookies.
Oh, those smell like dog poop.
Are those dog poop cookies?
No, that's the flaxseed oil
you're smelling.
These are heart-healthy
cookies for some of our
burlier Americans.
Sue, we're not going
to do this anymore.
Are you turning on me in public?
The two of you are making a
very serious mistake today,
the likes of which have not been
seen since the Mexican Indians
sold Manhattan
to George Washington
for an upskirt photo
of Betsy Ross.
Hey, man, uh,
why didn't you show
at the audition?
I wanted to, I did, but after
what Coach Beiste did to you...
Do you know how everybody talks
about you Glee guys?
Oh, yeah, you get used
to all that.
Finn, I'm, I'm the new guy.
That means I'm already on
the outside looking in.
I don't want to start off
three touchdowns behind.
I got to go.
Coach Beiste makes us
do a hundred push-ups
for every minute
we're late, so...
Yeah, you made the
team, that's cool.
Uh, what position?
Quarterback.
Excuse me, Sunshine.
Hi, I'd like to officially
welcome you aboard
and give you our Glee Club
fall rehearsal schedule.
She won't be joining
your Glee Club.
Oh, are you her dad?
Her director.
Dustin Goolsby,
new coach of Vocal Adrenaline.
Oh, and they gave me and my
mom a condo and a green card.
- How did you even
find out about her?
- Hey, Will,
I went ahead and made
that phone call.
Should have gone along
with the poop cookies.
I actually would have
stayed here, but I think
Rachel would have made
my life a living hell.
I just didn't trust her after
she sent me to a crack house.
Not cool.
It was nice to meet you.
What did they say?
Well, I talked 'em out
of giving you a "code red."
They were pissed,
and they had the right to be.
What you did was bad, Rachel.
We could have used Sunshine
to beat Vocal Adrenaline,
and now they're just
that much stronger.
Just do it already.
What?
Break up with me.
Okay, we both knew it was
just a matter of time.
I think you're forgetting I'm
not the quarterback anymore.
I'm just another Glee loser now.
Fact is, you should be
breaking up with me.
I'll never break up with you.
Me, neither.
I did it for the
team, you know.
I just, I-I love
everybody so much,
I didn't want anyone else
coming in and interfering.
You got to stop
saying that, Rachel.
I care about you
and everything,
but you got to admit the truth.
You didn't do this
because you love Glee Club.
You did it because you love
yourself more.
Okay.
I didn't want anyone else
hogging my spotlight.
Okay, I love it too much
to let it go that easy.
Do you think that
they'll ever forgive me?
They'll come around.
I think apologizing
would be a good start.
Where are you going?
The auditorium.
I just need
some alone time first.
¶¶ Kiss today good-bye ¶¶
¶¶ The sweetness and the sorrow ¶¶
¶¶ Wish me luck ¶¶
¶¶ The same to you ¶¶
¶¶ But I can't regret ¶¶
¶¶ What I did for love ¶¶
¶¶ What I did for love ¶¶
¶¶ Look, my eyes ¶¶
¶¶ Are dry ¶¶
¶¶ The gift was ours ¶¶
¶¶ To borrow ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, it's as if we always ¶¶
¶¶ Knew ¶¶
¶¶ And I won't forget ¶¶
¶¶ What I did for love ¶¶
¶¶ What I did for love ¶¶
¶¶ Gone ¶¶
¶¶ Love is ¶¶
¶¶ Never gone ¶¶
¶¶ As we travel ¶¶
¶¶ On ¶¶
¶¶ Love's what we'll remember ¶¶
¶¶ Kiss today ¶¶
¶¶ Good-bye ¶¶
¶¶ And point me toward ¶¶
¶¶ Tomorrow ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, we did what ¶¶
¶¶ We had to do... ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, won't forget,
can't regret ¶¶
¶¶ What I did for ¶¶
¶¶ Love ¶¶
¶¶ What I did for ¶¶
¶¶ Love ¶¶
¶¶ What I did ¶¶
¶¶ For ¶¶
¶¶ Love. ¶¶
