- But it went right through
- Word?
One shattered his lung,
which we just removed
If you didn't get him here so quick,
he might not have survived
So many arteries got hit,
he's lucky to be alive
It's major internal bleeding
from a wound by his navel
He's in critical condition,
but for now he's stable
Is he conscious?
Could we see him?
- Yeah, but no conversation
- All right
His heart rate is low
and under heavy observation
All right
Aw, shit, man
Damn, so why you in the streets
without the clique?
Knowin' this drama,

I'm so sorry, where are you?
I'm on myway

Baby, promise me right now

And won't go out looking for blood,

Look, my cousin will lose everything

There's a lot of things
I ain't tell you about myself
I don't care, I just want you to

What? You're pregnant?
Yeah, I swear on my holy father in heaven
Well, when did you find out, girl?
Why you ain't tell me?
I just had a check-up yesterday

All right, all right, all right,

But I got to, if I don't,

- I'll be a baby mama
- I know
What happened

I don't know, I guess they're late
What up with table number 5
yo, you taking their plate?
It's not ready, still waiting

Well, I don't like you standing around,

I pay you to work, boy
Go do something
Oh, shit, is that

That's a Hummer, though,

Hey, yo, what up, dawg?
It's been a minute
Well, what you want me to do?

Yes, thank you, it's wonderful
Good, good
Yo, yo, bring us some drinks

Got to know when to cash out
We're gambling, kid,

- My girl told me y'all was expecting
- Yeah.
You don't want to give birth to them
when you're dead
Man, fuck you, who the fuck
is you to critique?
I know you double-OG,
but I ain't new to these streets
I'm not saying you are
It's just the way
you playing your cards
How you swimming with the sharks
but ain't weighing the odds?
That's what I'm sayin', it's hard
They the ones that came at us first
I had to clap back, man,
you know how the streets work
They forced my hand
Thinkin' they could clap on my cuz
Then they ran up in a spot
And took the cash and the drugs
Now we at war
Dawg, I need some advice
Dawg, listen to wifey,
take heed for her life, see?
See, I'm knowin' your pain,
it's all in the game
You don't deserve to be stressed out
Callin' your name,
but that's where it leads
- niggas bleed for dastardly deeds
- I know.
You got the chance to be the father
To the bastard in me
I hear you, nigga
Believe me, I feel you, nigga
But before I leave town,
I got to kill these niggas
Dawg, you needed your dreams,
Why, when you were here to the scheme?
- 'Cause my
- Preach crime, your feelings is beamed
And make it and die,
couldn't see with the nakedest eye
Everybody's pride is the same
What difference is mine?
You got a point there, homie, it's true
That nigga's claiming

That goes for your clique
Pussy niggas holding their dick
Type that'd feed your mom poison
When they knowin' you're sick
It is what it is, man,
It's the life that we chose
Dawg, you caught up in the cycle
Though in spite of the dough
and rightfully so
Shit, you used to be on the block
Before you turned your life around
How many people you shot?
Believe it or not

Easy and quick
It's designed to fit in your briefcase

That's shit's ill
Take three of those, too
All right, my nigga,

This time, nigga,

Just take these shits

Just do that for me,

Take that, you don't owe me shit
All right, settle down, settle down
Listen up, y'all
Captain's on my ass
about this goddamn war
There was a blood bath
And apparently a lot of people got killed
Out in West Hollywood
Somewhere up in the hills
We have Task 4 to get us
insight in the case
So pay attention,
you might learn something
From what they have to say
Our sources tell us what we have
Is two families at war
If I could please direct
your attention to the wall
We been following both
families for quite some time
Even lucky enough to get
intel from the inside
What we have here is a chart
outlining the whole thing
From the bottom to the top
of the food chain
This here is Ike Smith
In the streets they call him Black
There's only one person above him
Oh, yeah? Who's that?
We don't know yet
But it's just a matter of time
We have the pressure on
Somebody out there's
bound to drop a dime
They're involved in everything
From extortion to drug traffic
We know they had a hand
In everything that's been happening
You got proof? Why don't we
just apprehend and convict?
We want to get 'em on murder
so the charges will stick
So who are those guys? And how come
they've all got bald heads?
They're from New York
A few of them did time in the fed
What's their story?
They don't seem to have any leader
But if somebody gives the orders
I would say that he does
Anybody even know
why the war came to pass?
Not sure, we think
a drug deal gone bad
We're gettin' heat from the mayor
To pick up the pace
Sergeant, any idea
Who'd be best for the case?
Yeah, Grant and Lou,
what about you two?
Where in the hell is Grant and Lou?
Sergeant, I don't think
they showed up today.
Well, you find them
and tell them to get
their ass on the case.
Stick got beef,
but the niggas is gone
You see a lot of shit
he picked up from armor?
Yeah, nigga got max
with wipes and Ilamas
You niggas out here
talkin' about my drama?
Shit, motherfucker,
you got enough guns
Whoever you going to kill
you can only kill once
Why are you gonna waste
all them shells on them chumps?
Shit, you can't lead by a uncle's nuts
All right, nigga, just
keep your hands clean
Before your Allah, just keep the scene
You know, if you need help,
I can get the team
Nothin' to make
a phone call to Q!ueens
Good lookin', my nigga,
appreciate the help
But this is personal,
I want to do it myself
Before I make
these niggas feel what I felt
They're pushing everywhere,
but I'm gon' take them down
Yeah, no doubt, do your thing
Problems, give us a ring
What you ain't got, we'll bring
Also pull some strings
I got that M16
With that infra beam
So either I'm gonna way
End up dead or in the bing
This better be the right house
Or your ass is dead, you feel me?
Empty this whole clip in your head
Yeah, do it. Matter of fact,
let me pop this punk.
- No, not yet
- Why?
We might need him.
Lock the trunk
All right
All right, so what's the plan of attack?
We kill the head, the body falls
So we're after Black
Y'all, go in the front
And I'll come in through the back
All right, but be careful, nigga
'Cause it might be a trap
All right.
This is too easy, man,
sure we in the right crib?
Would have thought they had
more security than this
Yo, Kye
Kye, watch your back
Oh, shit, I didn't even see that cat
That's 'cause you're falling off, nigga
I told you you was slipping
You heard that?
Hold up. Let me listen, nigga
Sound like it's coming from the kitchen
Let's go check it out
because my fingers is itchin'
Shut the fuck up, bitch.
Oh, Black, come out, you fat fuck
Where you at, bitch?

- Fuck you!
- Oh, shit!
Get the fuck out of my house!
Fuckin' bitch!
Oh, shit!
Fuckin' bitch. Shit.
Better speak, motherfucker

Hold up, hold up, son
Before you air him out
Let me find if he know
Black whereabouts

nigga acting like a bitch
Kye beat the shit out of him,
and he still don't say shit
Listen, you better tell me
where that fat bastard is
Fuck y'all niggas,
I ain't telling you shit
See what I mean?
You want to die slow,
or you want to die quick?
I don't give a fuck, nigga, kill me,
you can suck my dick
Young niggas, no respect and shit
Go ahead, nigga, pop his wig
Fuck-
Lights out
Let's get the fuck out of here
Nice house
So what it looking like here
Looks like the perps
made an entrance
Through the front and the side
They scrubbed the house clean
Killed everybody in sight
We got a guy taped up
- With a hole in his brain
- Damn.
It was fuckin' brutal
They even killed the maid
Damn, they meant business, huh?
Well, they left over 00 shell cases
Will we at least find out
Where the owner of the place is?
No, but his worker's right there
With the cigar in his mouth
Excuse me, sir
Do you work for
the owner of the house?
Yeah, he's on the phone
Visiting family in the hospital
He asks who are you
And did you find
the man responsible
He Detective Grant
And I'm Detective Lou
We ain't made any arrests
We're doing the best that we can do
But if you have a clue
That could be essential to the case
Please speak, help us lock
these animals in a cage
Man, put me on speaker,
let 'em talk to me
- Okay
- Made any new friends?
- No
- Or new enemies?
- Hell, no
- Come on, nigga, give me something
- I can't think of none at all
- He got my card
If you think of something,
give me a call
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All right. I be in touch
You got somewhere
that you can stay
While they clean this place up?
What?
Yeah, in Honolulu
I got some real estate
nigga, till this investigation ends
You can't leave the state
What? Fuck that scene,
now I'm upset
Don't hassle me to tell me
I'm the suspect
- That's what it look like
- Bullshit
Pull up the car right now
And, Afteeka, meet me
at the cigar lounge
I'm gonna have to kill 'em now!
Yo, Stick getting really near
Word to mother
Yo, boss, think we should
call your brother?
Listen to me, nigga
Word get out about this shit
You might as well
just slit your wrists
All right, all right, all right, man
God damn it, I don't believe this shit
They killed my girl
Got to light that bunch
Them niggas got to die for that shit
It's war, that's it
Now get the fuck up!
Let's go!
Move, bitch!
The hit man you called is here.
All right, show him in.
- And I'll be downstairs.
- All right.
Hello, Mr. Black
I'm King Khi, pleased to meet you
What I understand, you having
complications with some people
Yeah, that's right, I want those fuckers
shot in the brains
I don't care what it cost
See, money ain't a thing
- Hey, Kim, what's on the menu today?
- Chicken
You hungry? You want this bitch
to fix you a plate?
I'd like to conclude
our business, if that's okay
Oh, you get right down to it, huh?
You don't play
What happens if you fail,
or if you miss a target?
No, I always get my man
I'm afraid failure's not an option
I would think my referrals would
speak for themselves
I never missed a mark
in the ten years I worked in this field
If it's human, can bleed and die
And givin' you problems,
I could solve 'em
I'll need half now
The other half when the job's done
Send 'em back, you'll get the rest
When you kill these motherfuckers
And show me proof of death
As soon as it's done,
I want you to call here
You wanna count it, nigga,
make sure it's all there?
No, that won't be necessary
Killing game is legendary
This time tomorrow, yo
You'll find him in the mortuary
Two days later, dawg
You'll find him in the cemetery
Mom's cryin' sins buried, Pa,
no need to worry
Here go his files,
with all his specifics
I don't see why you need it
Just hit him with the business
To be optimum effective
I need the logistics
No fingerprint shit,
no clues for forensics
No evidence and no breathing witness
It's what I do, bro, business is business
Hey, you want Kim to walk you out?
No, man. I found myway in.
I can find myway out.
That's an awful nice watch,
it must cost a pretty penny
Can I get you somethin'?
Yeah, let me get a double shot of Henny
Looks like somebody's
having a hell of a day
But I'm telling you,
you can't drink them demons away
If experience is the best teacher,
then listen here
I know, I've been
trying it for 15 years
- What's your name?
- They call me Sticky, and you?
I'm Sam, have a seat
Get some free advice
from an old man
- So what's up?
- Nothing, my life's a mess
Life or death, I'm drownin',
tryin' to fight for breath
Wanna get out, but end up back
right in the mess
Just confused,
don't know my right from left
Well, here's my advice,
I say fuck the world
What's her name?
If there's trouble, it's gotta be a girl
Well, she ain't involved,
but her name is Heaven
Tryin' to get her out this hell hole
Just found out she's pregnant
You caught up in that love shit
No wonder you're trippin'
Don't you know
everybody in love got conditions?
They only love you
if you do this, you do that
Only love you if you're
like this or like that
- Right.
- Never trust friends
Learn to use your other sense
And seal the intentions
and say less then necessary
Every living creature's
First law of life is survival
A man might kill a few
But he won't die for you
The only one that ever did that
Name's in the Bible
And they even usin'
your religion to divide you
Listen, this whole country's a prison
But it's so damn big,
you don't know you're in it
- Damn.
- They got apartments and cars
And planes and supermarkets
Jobs, businesses makin' big profits
But try to leave without a passport
And you'll see,
just how much in jail you are
Don't playwith your life
You might not get another one
The hell with everybody,
look out for number 1
I hear you, brother,
but livin' like that just seem wrong
When you're dead
and you're gone, son
The world still go on
Hey, yo. Come here.
- Yo, let us talk to you for a second.
- Come here, nigga.
I didn't know it was illegal
- To cross the intersection
- Nah, it's not
Just wanna ask you some questions
Mind if we search you, nigga?
You got anyweapons?
Wait, wait, hold up, man
I ain't breakin' no laws
- What's the problem?
- Don't you need probable cause?
Fuck that, I know my rights
Hell no, you can't search me
What's up with your partner?
What's wrong, you wanna hurt me?
If we wasn't in public,
I'd make you beg for mercy
Crooked-ass cops,
man, all ya niggas dirty
No, you listen to me, punk
Don't you ever disrespect me
No, you ain't that big, homie
Trust me, you ain't ready
I'll kill you, motherfucker
You think you tough, huh?
Huh, motherfucker?
All right, all right, that's enough
We got word you got
a war goin' on with Black Mike
Well whoever's your informant
They hitting the crack pipe
If I'm under arrest,
then put the cuffs on me
I'm legitimate,
I own a record company
The record company you own
Is how you're cleaning the dough
And the money came from selling
Ecstasy and the blow
Well, if you need a fix
Then come see me, then
Oh, shit, you's a comedian
Yeah.
Except I'm not that funny
I ain't jokin, I got Johnnie Cochran money
Oh, so you's a rich nigga
Me, homeboy, knock ya bloody
Don't think 'cause you a cop
It might not get ugly
Don't think 'cause I'm a cop
And you got some money,
I won't take
This badge off now,
and beat you bloody
So what's up, nigga?
Let's do this.
- I'll call your bluff.
- Lieutenant.
Come on, Lieutenant.
That's enough.
- You lucky, motherfucker.
- You lucky.
I'm gonna see you next time.
- Yo, let's just get in the ride.
- Shut the fuck up, nigga.
Look at this fuckin'
nigga right here.
What up, nigga, man?
Yo, what up Stick.
What's poppin', my nigga?
You a wild boy, son.
You really popped two cops?
Yeah, fuck them pigs,
they deserve what they got
But how Phya holdin' up
in the hospital?
- Man, he be all right
- Yeah?
- You know that nigga's strong as a bull
- Right.
But look, dawg, right now,
you need to chill
- What?
- Too much heat on you
We just put up a million for bail
I want that nigga Black dead
Just as bad as you
- We raided his house, nigga
- But what did that do?
He's still alive, still breathing
Still walking, still talking
I won't be satisfied until he's still
- In a coffin, dawg
- I can't talk to this nigga, man
You wanna be a hot head, you see?
niggas never learn
'til they get shot dead
But Stick, they killed
our niggas and took our cake
They had it in for us soon as we
stepped foot in this state, man
But goin' to war
with Black will be a big mistake
That nigga gotta die
And I don't care what you say
Yo, why you actin'
like you scared and shit?
Yo, look, nigga, don't come at me
With no scared business, okay?
I'll put a hole in the nigga
quicker than you
No argument there, with guns
Nobody's sicker than you
That's right, nigga,
don't you ever forget that fact
- So then what's up, dawg?
- What's up?
Whywe can't get at Black?
We done bothered his house
They be waitin' for the attack
And walkin' right into a trap?
Gotta be smarter than that
It's his town, his advantage
He holdin' the weight,
even police workin' for him
They rolled on me today
See, he a dumb nigga
He don't hear nothing I say
nigga won't be satisfied
until he's slumped in the grave
You ain't learn from the club
And the police shit? Who this?
Your brother flossing in his new whip
nigga, when you get back in town?
Just now, heard about
the bullshit that went down
What's up, nigga?
Come here, gimme a pound
- You all right?
- Yeah, man
- Just sick of these clowns
- Come on, relax, man
I'm here, let's have some fun
Jump in the whip,
come with me to make this run
- Man.
- What's up?
They some dumb ass niggas, yo
They don't fuckin' listen, bro
I'm tellin' you, they gon' fuck around
And get us all caught up
But niggas did come at us first
And? A tooth for some teeth
We can't let it worse, man
I hear you, I ain't tryin'
to fight with you
But, brother, I know
when somethin' ain't right
Who'd you talk to?
What's wrong?
You ain't yourself, the Stick I know
Woulda been ready
to give these other niggas hell
And he wouldn't of stopped
'Til them niggas
was dead, what's up
Lil' bro, what's
going on in your head?
Papered up,
thinking about changing it up
Mywhole lifestyle,
thinkin' about hanging it up
Had a lot on my mind
That's why I never said shit
- And I just found out my girl pregnant
- Damn.
I want out, son, I got enough green
As a man, gotta put
my seed before my team
I just think that a nigga gettin' older
And gettin' sick
of lookin' over my shoulder
My heart just get
colder and colder
Till it's over, I live like a soldier
When we was comin' up,
'member what I told ya?
You gon' always have to
look over your shoulder
The game make your heart
colder and colder
Till it's over, live like a soldier
I mean, damn, what can I say?
You made up your mind,
look like the decision is made
Yeah, I'm gonna do it,
I'm leaving today
Just gotta pick up my girl
Then I'm out on a plane, but
Brother to brother,
gotta ask you a question
When I go, do I at least
have your blessings?
Man, what you talking about?
- What kinda question is that?
- Just sayin', man.
Oh, shit, You got your strap?
Get down!
Shit, nigga I told you you missed
The motherfuckers ain't dead
- Should we bounce?
- Hell no, Black will have our heads
- Yo, you hit?
- No, I'm good, son
- What about you?
- No, I'm good
Here, take this, on the count of two
Yo, fuck that, I need this reward,
let's get this bread
I got enough lead to tear both them
niggas to shreds
Yeah, yeah, you right, on the wall
Let's get this dough
Oh, shit, where the fuck did they go?
- Right here, motherfucker.
- Oh, shit.
What's up now, motherfucker?
Dear God, my nigga,
you gotta help me
I know I said I quit the game
when I was wealthy
The times was hard,
the moneywas easy
I meant no harm,
you gotta believe me
Fuck I do now? No turnin' back
Too much money at stake
Too many niggas got clapped
I'm goin' to hell with
the rest of the planet
I know it, I broke
all your Commandments
You don't know what
this world do to you
The last time I been
to church was a funeral
You can't hear me, why fool myself?
I'm alone in this world
talkin' to myself
Believe me, my brotha
He hears every syllable
You look troubled,
like there's something killing you
I'm knowing your pain
- Without even knowing you
- How you know my pain?
I been there, I know exactly
what you're going through
These streets, they can eat you alive
It's a shame what you gotta do
just to survive
First you gotta
know about the hood
To be my teacher
- Well, son, I wasn't always a preacher
- Yeah?
- I been in the game, I been in the prisons
- Word?
- I was living in pain with an addiction
- Damn.
- I did a few things when people was missing
- Word?
It's never in vain,
just talk and he'll listen
Just tryin' to live my life better
Man, with God as mywitness
Then drop to your knees,
ask for forgiveness
Get outta the dark,
come be in the light
It's not that easy,
I done did some things in my life
Until you make peace with the Lord
Nothing go right,
you must walk by faith-
I know, and not by sight
But a nigga just ain't gonna catch
The Holy Ghost overnight
With temptation,
it's always a constant fight
I feel you, but cats
out here ruthless
Pop you, throw you in the trunk
Couldn't give two shits
I'll be lucky to live
Through the end of the night
See, that right there
should tell you something
You probably not living right
You need to surround
yourself with love
I'm just a pastor, only God can judge
But you right, though
I know enough is enough
I guess I'm looking
for a blessing
From the man up above
Yo, niggas is trying to kill you
Cops is, too, you fronting
I'm good, just go the hospital
- And visit your cousin
- All right.
- All right, man. One.
- One.
Yo, what up, ma?
My bad for showin' unexpectedly
But I need to holla
at you for a second, P
Yo, yo, yo, back up, dude
Motherfucker,
how 'bout I back up you?
Oh, shit.
nigga, you want some, too?
Sticky, what's wrong with you
Ain't nothing wrong with me
I'm perfectly sane, I just came
To tell you that I'm
gettin' outta the game
That's not what it
looks like from my side
Looks like you're about
to catch a double homicide
My bad, it's just motherfuckers now
They be makin' me mad
Come here, come here, let's talk
- Yo, you all right?
- It's all right, boys
- You can all go take a walk
- Okay.
I'm glad you came
So what's this talk about
you getting out of the game?
Yeah, yeah that's it for me
I'm all done, no more
movin' bricks for me
And it ain't 'cause
the police is hip to me
Or 'cause that nigga
Black put a hit on me
I'm just tired of
all the death drivin' me wild
I'm about to have a child,
move, start a new lifestyle
So, from now on,
you can deal with Tye and Phya
Hangin' up my guns,
I'm out, I retire
You think it's that easy?
Just like that?
Like I'm some bitch
that you fucked
And never called back?
- Yo, look, P-
- No, no, don't look, P me
I have a shipment coming in, 350 ki's
My boys'll make the pickup
And you'll get your bread
One's a trigger-happy cop-killer,
and one's a coke head
Now, you tell me,
what am I supposed to do?
Depend on those idiots
in your so-called crew?
P, I know you got a shipment,
I'm just tryin' to help you
But I'm out, that's it
I don't know what to tell you
Yo, you walk away
from me, you're dead
You hear me? You're dead!
Hey, yo, what up, dawg?
Holdin' my head
as much as possible
- How Phya doin'?
- Doin' good, still in the hospital
- Sure you ready?
- For my seed? Do what I gots to
- All right, be safe
- Man, I'm shootin' through these obstacles
Listen, first we got
passports, all in new names
So, you shouldn't have
no problem boardin' a plane
Got a private jet waiting
that can leave when you're ready
Can take you to a major
port 00 miles from the city
Got a man on the inside
if you feel you in trouble
'Cause knowin' you,
you got a few mil in a duffle
Parachutes in the duffle
if you really in trouble
- Yo, you serious?
- Yeah, dawg
I'm feelin' your struggle
See, that's why I fuck
with you, O, for real
When it come down to it,
you so for real
I owe you big over this one
Spades, in fact, it might
take a little while
- But I'm gonna pay that back
- My nigga, no worries here
I don't give to receive
My gift is you being present
when they deliver your seed
See, that's what I mean,
we like family, yo
Only a nigga like you
could understand me, yo
Ay, yo, good lookin', nigga
Come on, dawg,
you know I got your back
- I owe you one
- Knock it off, you don't owe me jack

Yo, I heard some shit,

Now she a D.T.

Yo, hold up, man, I'm sayin'
Is this source reliable?
Of course, dawg, besides,
did I ever lie to you?
Nah, man, but this

If what you say is true
- Then I'm on a sinking ship
- I know.
Me and dude's in
the middle of an all-out war
And what for?
So he could call me out to the law?
That's the same motherfuckin' reason
that I told you for
You can't be sleeping

You know I got your back, homeboy
You's my man, now

The 5th door on the left side
Okay, thank you
Oh, don't mention it, anytime
What kinda gangsta is you
In the hospital hidin' out?
Well, it's time to put the fire out
What the fuck is this?
Ain't that a bitch?

You fightin' a war you can't win
You know that shit

Oh, yeah, you think you Biggie?
You ready to die?

- Goodbye, bitch
Tell God I said hi
There's someone at the hospital.
Someone, help, please.
No, they're shooting.
Oh, my God, Sticky
What's wrong with you?
I left a thousand messages
I've been calling you, calling you
I had a bad feeling
ever since you left
Don't ever do that to me again
You had me scared to death
Baby, baby, calm down
- Everything is all right
- Okay, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right
- Thank God
I almost had a heart attack because of you
I just wanted to tell you, baby,
that I love you
I love you, too, ma, I love you more
Now, listen to me carefully,
our time runnin' short
Pack one bag light enough
to go on board
I'm picking you up,
and we headed to the airport
- What did you do?
- Nothing
- Promise me
- I promise
I ain't do nothing,
what, you don't trust me?
I trust you, I love you, you are my heart
I just don't wanna
see you get ripped apart
Before I met you, Heaven,
swear I was livin' in hell
And If I hurt you girl,
don't think I could forgive myself
It's not that, I know you wouldn't
Hurt me intentionally,
just don't wanna
See you end up dead
or in a penitentiary
Promise when we leave,
you gon' start livin' right
I won't live a double life
- Like my brother Isaiah
- Who?
My brother Isaiah,
well, my stepbrother
He always in trouble,
if it's not one thing, it's another
I can't lie, ma, yeah, I got caught up
in the game
But, I put it all behind me when we
step on that plane
I hope so.
Luckywe showed up
when we did, boy
- Them niggas tried to dead you
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now what you want, a medal?
I know this surgeon
that works this crib
Forget the doctors, you always said
It's worse than it is-
- You ain't Supernigga
- Damn!
You need medical attention
Phya, don't be stupid
When you start hitting the blow?
Don't worry about it, cousin
Why you wanna know?
Ever since y'all left New York
It seems like the whole family
been falling apart
I mean, when's the last time
we had a heart to heart?
I ain't with that sentimental shit
nigga, don't start-!
Oh, you need a doctor, quick
I don't feel pain
It's like I never got hit
You hard-headed,
you don't listen to shit
You know Stick gettin' out the game
and havin' a kid?
- What? Who told you that?
- He told me
When niggas tried
to kill us on the Ave
Shit got ill, we turned guerilla fast
And your boy, Killer Mike,
was running niggas into mass
Just gimme my gat
He good, man
With my own life I vouch for him
That's your life, nigga,
I'm gonna hold you to that
What the fuck you doing?
What the fuck did you just do?
Are you crazy?
God damn.
Yo, what up? This is Phya,
what's good?
- Tell me, what's really hood?
- Yo.
Yeah, son, I'm out the hospital
- Start thinkin', man
- Had the blaze, had to pop, too
You can't be serious
Word? You can't be serious
Aw, man, where they headed?
I'm coked out, wilin' out niggas
'bout to get deaded
What happened now?
Come on, hit me with it
- Holla back
- Go ahead, nigga, hit me with it
Damn, I ain't even see this shit
To the airport,
damn, I can't believe this shit
There was a shootout at the hospital
We have units in route, but get this
Guess who was registered to the room
Don't tell me
Stick's first cousin Phya
Ever since he came here,
the death toll got higher
Yeah, I could imagine
But wait, it gets worse
We have a positive I.D. from a nurse
She said Stick's brother BamBam
Came in like a mad man
- Killed three people
- Took Phya and ran
If you ask me, their operation's
about to nose dive
Turns out Killer Mike
was playing both sides
Okay, where's Grant and Lou?
I think they're runnin' surveillance
On Stick and his crew
Listen here, fuck the bullshit
I ain't trying to be
standin' at the lobby, yo
You sure you spoke to
my contact at the Bellagio?
Do they know I'm comin'?
Yeah, boss, everybody know
The fight is sold out
But you got seats
right beside the rope
Good, good, call up Bobby Joe
At the escort service
Tell him I need a party ho
I already did,
he's sending that bitch
- From the Ferrari show
- What?
Get another bitch,
fuck that retarded ho
All right, whatever you want
You know I'm on that, shit
You the boss, you the one
that's signing the checks
- Damn right.
- Hello?
Aw, shit.
Hey, boss, it's your big brother
I think he found out what happened
He on the phone, he wanna talk
And he don't sound happy
Jesus Christ,
did you say something?
Hell, no. I like my life
- What's up big bro?
- What?
Don't what's up me, nigga
Is you just playing dumb
and you tryin' to fuck me, nigga?
You say them New York niggas
ain't pose no threat
But we losin' money, niggas are dyin'
The Feds breathin' down my neck
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, bro
Ain't no need to get upset
I can handle it
Then why the shit ain't handled yet?
Just give me one week
I swear I'll have the shit and smack
You got one day
Or I'm gonna put a bullet
in your ass, nigga
So, what's up, bossolini?
What you want me to do?
You wanna head to LV
or tally up the crew?
What? I ain't paying
that nigga no mind
We going to Vegas, see the fight
Make sure we on time
Okay, whatever you say
Man, what the hell is you doing?
Put that gun away
Besides, you can't bring no gun
- On no goddamn plane
- Relax, I know the security team
We could bring anything
Man, this nigga here must be
the goofiest nigga alive
Rollin' around here with drug money
and guns up in his ride
You would think they'd know
they're under investigation
Man, I can't wait to get this nigga
here down to the station
- Look, he's pullin' off
- Follow him, nigga
- See where he lead us
- Okay
But stay back a few cars,
nigga, so they don't see us
I'm gonna call in for backup
- No, don't call for no backup yet
- Why?
Just stay on his tail,
he might take us to his connect
- I don't know, man.
- Look, white boy,
just do what I say, all right?
Know how much press we'll get
if we crack this case?
Is that all you care about?
Seeing your name in the paper?
I thought being a cop was being
about making it safer
- Okay?
- Follow him, nigga
Hey, boss, you said you'd go and kill
that nigga Stick when you catch him
Well, there he go,
right there, walking with Heaven
Whoever bring me his head
is a hundred grand richer
And get my sister
Heaven, get moving, girl,
we gotta run for cover
Wait, I don't understand
- Come on
- That's my stepbrother
- What? Stepbrother?
- Yeah
That ugly motherfucker your stepbrother?
His father's my mother's husband
What's going on?
Why they shooting?
Whywe running?
How could you do this?
I loved you, you set me up
You ain't tell me that your brother
was that fat fuck
What? No
What are you talking about?
I told you about Isaiah
when you called my house
Yeah, about Black Ike,
Who the fuck is Isaiah?
They the same person-
Ike is short for Isaiah
- Ain't that Black's main ride?
- Yeah, that's Stick's GT
Hope we ain't too late
You ready? Cock your heat
We gotta do something
Aren't we supposed to be the police?
Man, them low-life niggas
ain't gonna bust on me
So we just sit here
and watch it unfold while you eat?
Man, think about it like it's the movies
We got front row seats
- Where did they go?
- I don't know
They couldn't went far, but go outside
In case they double back to the car
Are you insane?
You was gonna take a gun on the plane?
But you promised me
you would leave behind the game
And I will, as soon as we get in the air
But I'm keeping the gun
till I know that we're in the clear
You heard that?
That motherfucker
around here somewhere
- Give me that gat
- Should I speak to him?
I might could talk
some sense in his head
Nah, we way past that,
too much blood been shed
- Now quiet
- Okay
Follow me this way,
we'll be out this hell hole
- If we could make it to the plane
- You outgunned
- Oh, shit
- Two to one
Come here, baby girl
You drop your gun
No, you drop your gun right now
- Or I'm gonna blaze you
- Sis.
I'm not going
anywhere with you, I hate you
What lies did you tell her
to turn her against me?
I'm not gonna rest until you're 6 feet deep
I think you're scared,
that's why you're in the car so long
We're city officials, punk,
we enforce the law
Punk? Look, why go in there
and get shot to hell
When we can just play clean-up, man,
and let them kill theyself?
Drop the gun right now,
or I'm gonna kill your wife
You're gonna kill your own sister, nigga?
- Fuck that bitch, I never liked her
- Hey, yo, Stick
- Phya
- Watch out, son
Oh, shit
Where'd they come from?
No. No! No!
Heaven? I thought I got killed
I just had the craziest dream,
and it felt so real
Dreamt you was the sister
of myworst enemy
He tried to kill my brother,
my cousin, my peoples and me
Everybodywas dying,
there was no one left
I remember trying to escape,
it was life or death
They had police trying to kill me
We was on the run
And you, you was pregnant,
having my son
Even O was in my dream,
he tried to help us get away
At least I think it was him,
I can't remember his face
He gave us fake passports
to get us out of the States
But there was a shoot-out
at the airport inside the gate
I thought I'd probably get popped
'cause of the price on my head
Or end up getting locked
and doing life in the fed
Then I woke up just as I was dying
What's the matter, Ma?
Why you crying?
It wasn't a dream
What? What do you mean?
- Of course it was a dream
- No
I got hit point-blank
with a sawed-off in the chest
- Baby
- Either I be dead or I be bleeding to death
Look
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Somebody help!
Oh, God.
I'm right here, baby.
No.
No!
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
I'm right here, baby.
Stick.
No!
