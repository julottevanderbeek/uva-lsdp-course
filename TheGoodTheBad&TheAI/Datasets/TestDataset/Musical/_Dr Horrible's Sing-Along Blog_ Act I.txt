So that's, you know,
coming along.
I'm working with a vocal coach.
Strengthening the... ah.
Lot of guys ignore the laugh and
that's about standards. If you want to
get into the evil league of evil,
you have to have a memorable laugh.
What ? Did you think Bad Horse
didn't work on his neigh ?
His terrible death weenie.
No response BTW from
the league yet.
But my application
is strong this year.
A letter of condamnation
from the deputy mayor.
That's gotta have
some weight so...
Fingers crossed !
E-mails !
Too-sly-for-you writes "hey,
genius !"
Whoa !
Sarcasm, that's original !
"Where are the gold bars you
were supposed to pull out
of that bank vault with
your transmatter ray ?"
"Obviously it failed or it
would be in the papers."
Well, no, they're not gonna say
anything in the press but...
behold !
Transported from
there to here !
The molecules tend to
shift during the...
transmatter.... uh... advance.
But they were
transported in bar form.
And they clearly were...
And by the way it's
not about making money,
it's about taking money.
Destroying the status quo
because the status is not quo.
The world is a
mess and I just...
need to rule it.
I'm gonna...
Smells like cuman.
So transmatter is 75%.
And more importantly the
freeze ray is almost up.
This is the one.
It stops time.
Freeze ray. Tell your friends.
We have... Oh, here's one from
our good friend Johnny Snow.
"Dr. Horrible, I see you are once again
afraid to do battle with your nemesis.
I waited at Dully Park for
You're not my nemesis.
My nemesis is Captain Hammer.
Captain Hammer corporate tool.
He dislocasted my shoulder.
Again. Last week.
Look, I'm just trying to
change the world, okay ?
I don't have time for a grudge
match with every poser in a park.
Besides there's kids
in that park so...
Here's one
from dead-not-sleeping.
Long time watcher, first time writing.
Blah blah blah blah.
"You always say in your blog
that you will show her the way,
show her you're a true villain.
Who is her ?
And does she even
know that you're...
Laundry day... See you there.
Under things... tumbelling.
Wanna say... "Love your hair"
Here I go... mumbling.
With my freeze
ray I will stop...
the world.
With my freeze ray I will find
the time to find the words to...
tell you how...
how you make... make me feel.
What's the phrase ?
Like a fool.
Kinda sick.
Special needs.
Anyways... with my freeze
ray I will stop...
the pain.
It's not a death ray or an ice beam,
that's right Johnny Snow.
I just think that
you need time to know
that I'm the guy
to make it real.
The feelings you
don't dare to feel.
I'll bend the
world to our will.
And we'll make
time stand still.
That's the plan.
Rule the world.
You and me. Any day.
- Love your hair.
- What ?
No, I love the air.
Anyway, with my freeze
ray I will stop...
- Hey, doc.
- Moist, my heroe.
Moisture, buddy,
what's going on ?
Life of crime. Got your mail.
Hey, didn't you go on
a date last night ?
Conflict Diamond told me you were
doubling with Bait And Switch.
Yeah.
Yeah ?
It was alright. I kinda thought I was
supposed to end up with Bait but...
I hear you.
I saw Penny today.
You talked to her ?
So close.
Just a few weeks from a
real audible connection.
I'm gonna ask...
Oh my God !
Is that from the league ?
It's from him,
that's his seal, isn't it ?
The leader ? Oh my God !
I got a letter from Bad Horse !
That's so hardcore.
Bad Horse is legend,
he rules the league with an iron hoof.
Are you sure...
Bad Horse !
He rides across the nation
the thorough bread of sin.
He got the application
that you just sent in.
It needs evaluation so
let the games begin.
A heinous crime to
show of course.
A murder would be
nice of course.
Bad Horse... is bad !
The evil league of evil
is watching so beware !
The grade that you receive
will be the last we swear.
so make the Bad Horse proud
or he'll make you his mare.
You saddled up,
there's no recourse.
It high ho silver,
side that horse.
- I don't know.
- Are you kidding ?
This is great !
I'm about to pull
a major heist !
You know, the Wonderflonium that
I need for the freeze ray ?
It's being
transported tomorrow !
Armored car ?
Carrier van. Candy for a baby.
Do you need anything
dampened or made soggy ?
Thanks but...
the league is watching.
I gotta do this alone.
Will you lend a caring hand
to shelter those who need it ?
You only have to
sign your name.
Don't even have to read it.
Would you help...
No ? How about you ?
- Will you lend a caring hand...
- Ah !
What ?
I was wondering if
I could just...
Hey !
I know you.
Hello. You know me. Cool !
I mean...
yeah, you do. Do you ?
From the laundromat.
Wednesdays and Saturdays except twice
last month you skipped a weekend.
Or... if that was you.
Could have been someone else.
I mean, I've seen you.
Billy is my name.
I'm Penny.
What are you doing ?
Hmmm texting.
It's very important
or I would stop.
What are you doing ?
Actually, I'm out here volunteering
for the Caring Hands homeless shelter.
Can you spare a minute ?
Hum...
Okay, go.
We're hoping to open a new
location soon. Expand our efforts.
There's this great
building nearby
that the city is just gonna demolish
and turn into a parking lot.
- But if we get enough signatures...
- Signatures ?
Yeah.
I'm sorry. Go on.
I was saying...
Maybe we could get the city to
donate the building to our cause.
We would be able to
pry 250 new beds,
get people off the streets and
into job training so they could
buy rocket packs and go to
the Moon and become florists.
You're not really interested
in the homeless, are you ?
No, I am.
But they're a symptom.
You're treating a symptom
and the disease rages on,
consumes the human race.
The fish rots from the head as they say.
So my thinking is why
not cut off the head.
Of the human race ?
It's not a perfect metaphor
but I'm talking about an
overall of the system.
Putting the power
in different hands.
I'm all for that !
- This petition is about the building.
- I'd love to sign it.
Thank you !
Sorry, I come on strong.
But you signed !
I don't wanna turn my back on
a fellow laundering person.
Well, if we can't stick together,
I don't...
I'll probably see you there.
No, I will. I...
She talked to me.
Why did she talk to me now ?
Maybe I should...
A man's gotta do what
a man's gotta do.
Don't plan the plan if
you can't follow through.
All that matters is taking
matters into your own hands.
Soon I'll control everything.
Hey ! Hey !
My wish is your command !
Stand back everyone !
Nothing here to see !
Just imminent danger and
in the middle of it : me !
Captain Hammer's here !
Hair bowing in the breeze !
The day needs my
saving expertise !
A man's gotta do what
a man's gotta do.
His destiny ends
with me saving you.
The only doom that's glooming
is you loving me to tears.
I'll give you a second
to catch your breath.
You idiot !
Dr. Horrible, I should have
known you were behind this !
- You almost killed her !
- I remember it differently.
If she...
It's curtains for you,
Dr. Horrible.
Lacey gently wafting curtains.
Thank you, Hammer man,
I don't think I can
explain how important it was
that you stopped the van.
I'd be splattered,
I'd be crushed in the debris.
Thank you, sir, for saving me !
Don't worry about it !
A man's gotta do what
a man's gotta do.
- You came from above.
- Are you kidding ?
What heist were you watching ?
Stop looking at her like that.
Did you notice that he
threw you in the garbage ?
- My heart is beating...
- When ass needs kicking,
- when bombs are ticking...
- I stopped the van !
The remote control
was in my hand !
Whatever !
So please give me a second
to catch my breath.
Balls !
Any dope with half a brain
can see the human
kind has gone insane
to the point where I don't know
if I'll upset the status quo
if I throw poison
in the water main.
Listen close to
everybody's heart
and hear that breaking sound.
Hopes and dreams
are shattering apart
and crashing to the ground.
I can not believe my eyes
how the world is filled
with filth and lies.
But it's plain to see
evil inside of me...
is on the rise.
Look around
we're living with
the lost and found.
Just when you feel
you've almost drown,
you find yourself
on solid ground.
And you believe there's
good in everybody's heart.
Keep it safe and sound.
With hope you can do your part
to turn a life around.
I can not believe my eyes.
Is the world finally
growing wise ?
'Cause it seems to me
some kind of harmony
is on the rise.
Make it slow.
He looks at me
and seems to know
the things that
I'm afraid to show
and suddenly I feel this glow.
And I believe there's good
in everybody's heart.
And keep that safe and sound.
Hopes and dreams
are shattering apart
and crashing to the ground.
I can not believe my eyes.
Is the world finally
growing wise ?
But it's plain to see
- evil inside of me
- rapture inside of me
is on the rise.
It is so dumb that we're been coming
here so long and never spoke.
I know, all those months doing
this stunningly boring choir.
I'm a fan of laundering.
I love it !
To smell the fabric softener...
the warm clothes
in your hands...
So good !
Hey, this is weird.
I ordered one frozen yogurt
and they gave me two.
You don't happen to like frozen yogurt,
do you ?
I love it !
You're kidding !
What a crazy random happenstance.
- Here.
- Thank you.
So how was your weekend ?
Did you spend the whole time
hunting wild signatures ?
Actually, I went on a date.
Get right out of town.
How was that ?
Unexpected.
He's a really
good-looking guy and
I thought he was
kinda cheesy at first.
Trust your instinct.
But he turned out to
be totally sweet.
Sometimes people are
layered like that.
There's something totally
different underneath
than what's on the surface.
And sometimes there's
a 3rd even deeper level
and that one is the same
as the top surface one.
- Huh ?
- Like with pie.
So are you gonna
see him again ?
I think I will.
- Billy ?
- Yeah.
You're driving this
fork in your leg.
So I am. Hilarious !
Alright, the wait is over.
This, my friends,
is my freeze ray
which with the addition of
the Wonderflonium I obtained
at my famously successful
heist last week.
I say successful in that
I achieved my objective.
It was less successful in that
I inadvertantly introduced my
archnemesis to the girl of my dreams.
And now he's taking
her out on dates
and they're probably going
to french kiss or something.
She called him "sweet".
How is he "sweet" ?
Right! Freeze ray !
So, as of tonight,
I am in the evil league of evil
if all goes according to plan,
which it will,
'cause I hold a PhD
in horribleness.
See you at the aftermath.
Peace !
But not literally.
Well... the freeze
ray needs work.
I also need to be a little bit more
careful about what I say on this blog.
Apparently the LAPD and Captain
Hammer are among our viewers.
They were waiting for me
at the Mayor's dedication
of the Superhero
Memorial Bridge.
The freeze ray takes a few
seconds to warm up and I wasn't...
Captain Hammer threw
a car at my head.
Not to worry though
'cause I'm...
One sec.
He saw the operation
you tried to pull today.
Your humiliation means
he still votes nay.
And now assassination
is just the only way.
There will be blood,
it might be yours
so go kill someone.
Signed Bad Horse.
Kill someone ?
Would you do it ?
To get into the evil
league of evil ?
Look at me, man ! I'm moist !
At my most badass, I make people feel
like they want to take a shower.
I'm not ELE material.
Killing is not elegant or creative.
It's not my style.
You got more than enough evil hours
to get into the henchman's union.
I'm not a henchman.
I'm Dr. Horrible.
I've got a PhD in horribleness.
Is that the new catchphrase ?
I deserve to get in.
You know I do.
But killing ? Really ?
Hourglass says she knows a kid in Iowa
who grows up to become president.
That'd be big.
I'm not gonna kill
a little kid.
- Smother an old lady ?
- Do I even know you ?
I just, you know,
really think I'm...
qualified for this job.
And... I just can't get
my foot in the door.
I'm sure you will.
I wanna do great things,
you know.
I wanna be an achiever
like Bad Horse.
The 3rd bread of sin ?
I meant Ghandi.
Well, I've been turned
down from plenty of jobs.
Even fired a few times.
I can't imagine
anybody firing you.
Neither could I.
Now I can visualize
it really well.
- But you know everything happens...
- Don't say for a reason.
No, I'm just saying that...
everything happens.
Not to me.
Here's the story of a girl
who grew up lost and lonely.
Thinking love was fairy tale
and trouble was
made only for me.
Even in the darkness
every color can be found.
And everyday your
rain brings water
flowing to things
growing in the ground.
Grief replaced with pity
for a city barely copping.
Dreams are easy to achieve
if hope is all
I'm hoping to be.
Anytime you hurt there's
one who has it worse around.
And every drop of rain
will keep you growing,
feeds your soul
within the ground.
So keep your head
up Billy buddy.
It's like Captain Hammer
is always saying.
Right !
How are things with
Cheesy on the outside ?
Good. They're good.
He's nice.
I'll be interested to know
what you think of him.
He said he might stop by.
- Stop by here ?
- Yeah.
Oh, goodness !
Look at my wrist ! I gotta go !
But what about your clothes ?
I don't want these. See you !
- Oh, pardon.
- Pardon !
Billy, this is Captain Hammer.
Oh, Billy, the laundry buddy.
It's very nice to meet you.
We're meeting now
for the first time.
You look horrobly familiar.
One of those faces I guess.
Have I seen you at the gym ?
At the gym, yeah.
I don't go to the gym,
I'm just naturally like this.
Oh, well.
Who wants to know what the Mayor
is doing behind closed doors ?
He is signing over a certain
building to a Caring Hands group
as a new homeless shelter.
- Oh my God !
- Yep !
Apparently the only
signature he needed
was my fist.
But with a pen in it.
That I was signing with.
I can't believe it.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you ! Thank you !
Oh !
Well, this is great.
I wish I could stay and chitchat.
It sure was nice to meet you...
Doctor.
You've got a little crush,
don't you doc ?
Well, that's gonna make
this hard to hear.
See, later I'm gonna take
little Penny back to my place.
Show her the command center.
The Hammer-cycle.
Maybe even the Ham-jet.
You think she likes me now ?
I'm gonna give Penny
the night of her life.
Just because you want her.
And I get
what you want.
See, Penny's giving it up.
She's giving it up hard.
'Cause she's with
Captain Hammer.
And these...
are not the hammer.
The hammer is my penis.
This appeared as a moral dilemma
'cause at first it was weird
though I swore to eliminate the worst
of the plague that devoured humanity
it's true I was vague on the
how so can it be that you
have shown me the light.
It's a brand new day
and the sun is high.
All the birds are singing
that you're gonna die.
How I hesitated
now I wonder why.
It's a brand new day.
All the time that you beat
me unconscious I forget.
All the crimes incomplete,
listen, honestly I'll live.
Mr. Coup. Mr. right. Mr.
Know-it-all is through.
Now the future's so bright
and I owe it all to you.
You've shown me the light.
It's a brand new me.
I've got no remorse.
Now the water's rising
but I know the course.
I'm gonna shock the world,
I'm gonna show Bad Horse.
It's a brand new day.
And Penny will see the evil me.
Not a joke, not a dork,
not a failure.
And she may cry but
her tears will dry
when I hand her the keys
to a shiny new Australia.
It's a brand new day.
Yeah, the sun is high.
All the angels sing
because you're gonna die.
Go ahead and laugh.
Yeah, I'm a funny guy.
Tell everyone goodbye !
It's a brand new day.
Looks like we're finding
out what a true hero is.
The Mayor himself will be on hand to
dedicate the new homeless shelter
and unveil the statue
of Captain Hammer.
It's a good day to be homeless.
It certainly is.
So they say Captain
Hammer's become a crusader,
political, he's cleaning
off the streets.
About time.
So they say that
it's real love.
So romantic.
He signed this.
So they say we'll have
blankets and beds
we can open by Monday
thanks to you.
Thanks to me.
It's the perfect story.
- So they say.
- A heroe leading the way.
Hammer's call to glory.
Let's all be our best.
Next up : who's gay ?!
So they say he saved her life.
They say she works
with the homeless
and doesn't even meet.
We have a problem with her.
This is his hair.
This is so nice.
I just might sleep at
the same girl twice.
They say it's better
the 2nd time.
They say you get to
do the weird stuff.
We do the weird stuff.
This is perfect for me.
So they say.
I guess he's pretty okay.
After years of storm,
they say that I've
finally found the way.
He's still not picking up.
There's no happy ending.
So they say.
Not for me anyway.
Shoud I stop pretending ?
Take the chance to
build a brand new day ?
This is his dry-cleaning bill
for his sweater vest.
And in just a few minutes,
we'll unveil the statue
of the man himself.
Thank you.
Thank you !
Justice has a name.
And the name that it has,
besides justice,
is Captain Hammer.
Ladies and gentlemen,
your heroe.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mayor,
for those kind words.
I hate the homeless.
This problem that
plagues our city.
Everyone should
have the basic...
You know what?
I don't need tiny cue cards.
When I fell deeply in love
with my serious long-term girlfriend
Penny. Wave your hand, Penny.
There she is. Cute, huh ?
Sort of a quiet nerdy thing.
Not my usual but nice.
Anyway...
She turned me on to this whole
homeless thing which is terrible.
And I realised
I'm not the only hero
in the room tonight.
I'm not the only
one who's fighting.
It may not be too classy
begging just to eat.
You know who does
that ? Lassie.
And she always gets a treat.
So you wonder what your part is
'cause you're homeless
and depressed.
But home is where the heart is.
So your real home's
in your chest.
Everyone's a hero
in their own way.
Everyone's got villains
they must face.
They're not as cool as mine
but folks you know it's
fine to know your place.
Everyone's a hero
in their own way.
In their own not
that heroic way.
So I thank my
girlfriend, Penny.
Yeah, we totally had sex.
She showed me there's so many
different muscles I can flex.
There's the dontoids
of compassion.
There's the abs of being kind.
It's not enough
to bash in heads
you've got to bash in minds.
Everyone's a hero
in their own way.
Everyone's got
something they can do.
Get up, go out and fly
especially that guy,
he smells like pooh.
Everyone's a hero
in their own way.
You and you and
mostly me and you.
I'm poverty's new sheriff
and I'm bashing in the slums.
A hero doesn't care if you're a
bunch of scary alcoholics bums.
Everybody !
Everyone's a hero
in their own way.
Everyone can blaze
a hero's drill.
Don't worry if it's hard.
If you're not afraid and
tard you will prevail.
Everyone's a hero
in their own way.
Everyone's a hero in their...
Look at these people.
Amazing how sheep will
show up for the slaughter.
No one condemming you, lined up
like lemmings you led to the water.
Why can't they see what I see ?
Why can't they hear the lies ?
Maybe the fee's too pricy
for them to realize,
your disguise is slippy.
I think you're slipping.
Now that your saviour
is still as the grave
you're beginning to fear me
like cavemen fear thunder
I still have to wonder
can you really hear me ?
I bring you pain,
the kind you can't suffer quietly.
Fire up your brain,
remind you inside your
rioting society is slipping.
Everything's slipping
away so...
go ahead, run away,
say it was horrible,
spread the word, tell your friends,
tell 'em the tale,
get a picture, do a blog.
Heroes are over with.
Look at him ! Not a word !
Hammer me nail.
Then I win,
then I get everything I ever...
All the cash,
all the fame and social change.
Anarchy... that I run.
It's Dr. Horrible's turn.
You people all have to learn.
This world is going to burn.
Burn ! Yeah, it's 2 "r".
H-O-R-R... Burn !
No sign of Penny. Good, I would
give anything not to have her see.
It's gonna be bloody.
Head up, Billy buddy.
There's no time for mercy.
Here goes no mercy.
That's not a good sound.
Why ?
A death ray !
Looks like Dr.
Horrible's moving up !
Let's see if this one works
any better than your others.
Don't !
I don't have time
for your warnings.
You give my regards
to Saint Peter
or whoever has his
job but in hell.
Oh, I'm in pain !
I think this is what
pain feels like.
Oh, mother !
Someone make it stop !
Get out of my way !
I gotta get out.
Penny ! Penny !
Penny !
Billy ?
Is that you ?
Penny, hold on. Oh no.
No, no, no, no !
- Are you alright ?
- Hold on.
It's okay. It's okay.
Captain Hammer would say that.
Penny !
Penny...
Dr. Horrible !
Why did you kill her ?
Dr. Horrible !
Here lies everything,
the world I wanted at my feet.
My victory's complete.
So hail to the king.
Arise and see.
So your world's benine.
So you think
justice has a voice
and we all have a choice.
Now your world is mine.
And I am fine.
...in my heart and it hurts...
Now the nightmare's real.
Now Dr. Horrible is here.
To make you quake with fear.
To make the whole world kneel.
And I won't feel...
a thing.
