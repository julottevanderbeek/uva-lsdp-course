Breathe, my love.
Don't be afraid.
I'm right here with you.
Another deep, cleansing
breath, my love.
And now a little push.
We did it! An egg!
MY EGG
Our egg.
And what a perfect egg it is.
With a perfect child inside.
Just a little look, ko-hoh,
at my new arrivals.
No, no, my dear.
They need warmth for survival.
- Just a little peak, ko-hoh.
- Move your nosy beak, ko-no.
Oh, this waiting, this anticipating...
...the birth of my perfect baby swan.
Our swans, dear.
Oh, yeah.
Three perfect eggs
Won't my kids be super
Wish that I could look inside
And see their future
Will you be leaders
The pride of the flock
Three little chips
Off of my old block
Well an apple doesn't fall
Too far from the tree
- Spittin' image of him, spittin' image
- That's right
- Spittin' image of him
- Oh, boy.
All I ask is perfection
From my sons and daughters
Like my humble self
And all the swans before us
Everyone will listen
When our trumpets call
You'll be my reflection
Everyone will see
-...me
- Spittin' image of him, spittin' image
- Indeed
- Spittin' image of him
- I do
- And I made your life complete
- Here, let me take a seat.
He can't wait till he sings
So the world will know
We're the best ko-hohers
In the whole ko-hoh so
The apple can't fall
Too far from the tree
Shoo-doop
The spittin' image of her
Shoo-doop
The spittin' image of him
An apple doesn't fall
Too far from the tree
- You'll be the spittin' image of me
- You'll be the spittin' image of me
- You're on my foot.
- Oh, no.
At last, I am a father
with all the pleasant duties...
...and awesome responsibilities
of fatherhood.
Welcome, my children,
to this magnificent pond...
...and the swamp adjacent.
Oh, you have chops, my little one.
I shall call you Ella.
Ko-hoh, my mama done and hatched me.
You have good pipes...
...and bad grammar.
I shall call you Billie.
A son.
My own blessed son!
Welcome, my child,
to wind and weather.
I'll... I'll...
I'll name you Louie...
...after my father, Louie,
and his father, Louie-Louie.
In the tradition of the great
swans before you...
...let me hear your ko-hoh!
Perhaps he's shy, dear.
No need to be shy, son.
We are all waiting to hear
your ko-hoh, Louie.
There, there...
There must be a mistake.
This child cannot be ours!
Someone must have switched the eggs.
Of course he's ours.
He's our Louie.
But my son is destined to be
the greatest of all the trumpeters.
Why, just look
at his superior parentage.
How will he ever speak
to his friends?
Or attract a mate'?
After all, what made you fall in love
with me was my...
...deep, powerful, resonant voice.
A father wants so much
for his children...
...and now this.
Oh, a tragedy. What despair!
- What is it'?
- It's a boy.
Another son'?
No, no, darling.
We are being watched by a human boy.
And with such big eyes.
- Marco'?
- Polo.
- Marco'?
- Polo.
- Marco'?
- Polo.
No fair. Louie didn't say "Polo."
Well, he can't talk.
Can't talk'?
And he calls himself a trumpeter swan?
I don't think so.
Louie can't help it.
Father says he's...
...you know, defective.
Well, defective one,
Marco Polo is a talking game.
And if you can't talk,
you can't play.
Those are the rules, buddy.
Hey! If you can't talk,
you can't play.
You're out of here, duckie.
A trumpeter swan who can't trumpet?
Oh, man, breaks my heart.
Okay, here we go.
My swan dive!
And now, Serena's all-time,
world famous cannonball!
One, two, three...
...here I go!
Hi. You want a slice of pond weed?
I'm Serena. What's your name?
That's your name? No way!
Hey!
You could say goodbye, Mr...
It's not fair.
Everyone has a voice but me.
You got the beat, honey.
Want to join in'?
If only they knew how much.
- Sorry.
- Now see what you did?
Well, I said I was sorry.
It's not my fault he's, you know...
The fox! I've gotta warn them.
Billie! Ella! Look out!
Please let them hear me!
Thank goodness you are safe,
my precious daughters.
Oh, how my heart trembled.
Look!
That human boy...
...saved the lives of our children.
He has my eternal gratitude.
When I think of what could have
happened with Louie unable...
...to cry out a warning. Although
I'm sure you did your best, son.
I did try.
Can't he see how hard I tried'?
Everyone okay? That was close.
Hey, no problem.
I could spend the whole day
watching the baby swans.
There are three cygnets.
Two of them said, "Beep."
The third one didn't.
I like him the best.
I wonder why baby birds beep?
"Why do baby birds beep?"
Is that all you can
think about, bird boy'?
What's it to you, A.G.?
Swans are fowl!
Besides, some of us are trying
to sleep. So get a life, will you!
She's so fine
She blows my mind, yeah
Hey, little guy.
I'm Sam Beaver.
You like music. Me too.
We're gonna rock, baby
All night long
Now you try it.
You can't sing?
So what? Not everybody
can do everything.
But I bet you're
a better swimmer than me.
Wait till he sees this!
I'm not really big on pond shrubbery.
Something stinks out here!
And your feathered friend
doesn't smell too good either.
You're pathetic, Beaver.
Thanks.
Hey, I like you too, little guy.
I got the freezin', breezin'
Low-down blues
The chill you feel is the result
of the onset of autumn...
...a subject about which
I have a few timely remarks.
Have you ever wondered, children...
...why we swans have wings attached
to our rather handsome torsos?
Not really, Father.
These mighty wings allow us to migrate
to more temperate waters.
Fly south to a warmer lake.
Oh, gotcha!
But we don't know how to fly.
As your father, I shall teach you.
First, I extend my long, elegant neck.
Then I retract my muscular feet.
Then I pump my glorious wings.
And finally, I call out
a mighty ko-hoh...
...when I take to the sky.
I have to ko-hoh?
Now I'll never be able to fly.
Come on.
Well, I'm gonna try.
Amazing!
Those guys down there look like ants.
Those are ants, silly.
You haven't left the ground yet.
That's it, Ella.
You're getting it, Billie.
Louie, I can't help but notice
you're not in the air.
You must try, son.
Look at us, Father.
Coming, girls.
You sound marvellous!
Okay, I'll try.
Hey, I'm flying.
I can do it!
Whoa!
Look at me, Father.
Oh, please, look at me.
Stay in your own lane, buster.
You should have honked.
That kid's a menace!
You must keep your eye
on the sky, my boy.
And I must find my son a voice.
I remember you.
You're the one who can't talk.
You know, I bet it makes you
a great listener.
Hey, want to see my triple gainer'?
Did you like that?
Boy, am I silly.
You can't talk,
and I'm asking you questions.
I'm the one who's weird.
She's not weird. She's great!
This sounds crazy, but I think
that little swan really understood me.
I wonder if I'll ever see him again.
There you are.
Good luck, little guy.
Have a nice winter!
I wonder how birds know
which way is south?
Do they follow the stars'?
How do they know which way is south?
There it is, my children.
Our new home.
Red Rock Lake, Montana.
Last one there's a rotten egg.
Come on, Louie, let's explore.
She's inviting me.
I have good news for you, darling.
Before you know it, your son, Louie,
will be in love.
Why... Why...
Why this is terrible news.
Love isn't terrible.
It is if you can't say ko-hoh
to the female of your choice.
And you have to spend the rest
of your life in loneliness and misery.
Oh, you do have a point, my love.
I have many points...
...but I am Louie's devoted father.
I shall act.
I hear there are man-made devices...
...that produce sound similar
to our wild trumpeting.
Similar but inferior, of course.
I shall search
for such a device for our son.
Even if I have to go
to the ends of the earth.
If I may make a suggestion, dear,
just got to Billings, Montana.
It's a lot closer.
All right. Very well, without
further ado, I will go to Billings.
Goodbye, my love. Ko-hoh!
What a swan. I just hope
he knows what he's doing.
How do human females put up
with these annoying love calls?
Oh, my. Who would want to mate
after hearing that?
Aha. Now that is the sound
of romance.
Aha. Now is my time to act.
May luck go with me.
Correction. May good luck go with me.
Here I go!
Somebody help me!
Help, I've been robbed
by a swan thief.
I'll get you, you miserable thief.
Thief? Me'? A lowly thief.
I did it for my son.
I only did it for my son, Louie!
Okay, mister, let's stop what we're
doing and hand over that weapon.
All right, I'm issuing you
a citation, little man.
It is illegal to shoot here.
Oh, yes.
This happens to be a bird refuge.
Can you read, sir'? Can you'?
Right there, there is a sign.
It says, "no hunting."
Right here. Black and white.
"N-O H-U-N ting."
What would that be'?
Say, no hunting, perhaps.
It is illegal to shoot.
The coast is clear.
Saved by the written word.
Oh, hey there.
I'm Sweets. Who are you'?
Hey, now I remember you.
The one who can't talk.
Oh, baby, don't feel bad.
Everybody's got something.
You like those words, baby?
Look. Humans have words...
...all over the place.
On their food.
On their tails.
Even on their mountains.
They can communicate
without even speaking.
Wow! This is great news!
What did I do?
Wait a minute, little fella,
where you going?
This is so exciting.
I have to try to tell him.
There's this thing
called reading and writing.
And I have this human friend...
...who can show me how.
What? You're not making
yourself clear, my boy.
Then I won't be, you know,
defective anymore.
I wish you could speak to me, Louie.
What wonderful things you would say.
He can't understand me now,
but one day he will.
What? What? What? What?
Louie? Louie? Wait, Louie?
Come back, son! Look!
I brought you a voice!
So bundle up, stay home,
and get out the hot cocoa.
Cinderella dressed in yellow
Went upstairs to kiss her fellow
What?
Whoa! It's you.
It can't be.
It is you.
Well, little guy,
how did you find me'?
What? You stepped
in bear droppings?
"No hunting."
I agree.
Why shoot animals?
Wait a minute. Did you just write?
No way!
You want to learn to write more stuff'?
So you can have a voice.
You're some swan, little guy.
He's gone.
He's... He's really, really gone.
It's her fault.
She wouldn't let him play Marco Polo.
And she wouldn't let him play
Duck, Duck, Goose.
It doesn't matter whose fault it is.
What matters is...
...is that he's gone.
I must leave this idyllic lake
and look for him.
Darling, darling, there's just
one little matter to consider.
We have no idea where Louie went.
Well, my birdly instincts
tell me he has gone...
-...south.
- Uh-huh. Well, what about north?
Or
Or west?
Or northeast? Or the southeast?
Or southwest and northwest?
Oh, there are too many directions!
We'll just have to hope
that Louie comes back.
If he ever does come back.
But who will I dive with
if he doesn't come back?
Congratulations, children.
Our special fern is finally ready
for the science fair.
I know we're all looking
forward to the fair.
Aren't we, Mr. Fern'?
That's Mrs. Hammerbotham. She taught
me to read when I was in first grade.
Now remember, boys and girls,
plants have feelings too.
Hello, Sammy.
Did you come to share
your special pet'?
He's not my pet. He has to learn how
to read and write as soon as possible.
Sammy, Sammy, Sammy.
I like the way Sammy
uses his imagination.
Don't you, children?
I'm sorry, Sammy,
but I've never taught a swan.
Oh, he's very well-behaved.
And he won't mess up the room.
He'll even raise his wing
when he has to go to the--
Oh, dear! Now look what's happened!
Oh, Sammy, don't you see.
We can't have this swan in class.
But you were the one
who taught me to respect...
-...the differences of others.
- Well, yes, dear.
You said the world
is a rainbow...
-...of different colours.
- Different colours.
- Different races.
- Different races.
- Different creeds.
- Different creeds.
- Different species.
- Different species!
Different species?
Did I say that?
Sammy, sometimes Mrs. Hammerbotham
says what she thinks she means...
...but that she doesn't actually mean
to mean. Do you know what I mean?
Please. You can't discriminate
against him just because he's poultry.
Oh, what a little darling.
Well...
Now, I guess we do need
a new science project.
What do you say, children?
Yes!
I'm in first grade.
This will be your seat.
Let's remember to keep
our wings to ourselves.
We must work on our fine motor skills.
Is it time for recess?
Oh, dear.
If only our eyes weren't
on the opposite sides of our head.
But I like the way
you're trying, little guy.
"One fine morning in the month of May,
Stuart arose early."
Wow! You have a name.
All right, little guy.
I mean, all right, Louie.
Well done, Louie.
Oh, what a special day this is.
- All right, Louie.
- Oh, you see, children...
...if we try our very, very best...
...we can do anything
we set our minds to.
Good luck, Louie.
I'll be counting the days till camp.
Wow! "Honour Swan
at Billings Elementary School."
That's me.
Thanks a million.
Hey, I got it covered.
Here comes the great one.
- Hey!
- You snooze you lose.
Got it! Open, I'm open!
- Oops.
- Butterfingers.
She scores.
Victory dance.
Ko... Ko...
Ko-hoh! Look!
Look! Can it be'?
Miracle of miracles, it's Louie!
Louie, my Louie, oh, you're so big.
But so thin.
Have you been getting enough to eat'?
Louie, my son...
...no one can imagine the extent
of our joy at seeing you again.
I'm sure I speak for everyone here--
Perhaps, you could speak
for everyone later, darling.
What's that weird thing
on your neck, Louie'?
Wait until they see this.
"Hi there."
Wha--'? Do you think Louie
has gone cuckoo, Mother'?
Well, he was always a creep.
Now he's a creep
with a little baby bib.
- What is he doing?
- Hi there.
Hear me, Serena. I did this for you.
What are you trying to say, Louie'?
Nothing's changed.
They still can't understand me.
How could I have been so stupid?
This, my son, is your trumpet.
If you learn to play it, Louie...
...you will be able to ko-hoh
like every other swan.
May the hills echo...
...with your new voice, my son.
Man, even for a rodent
this is tough on the ears.
I'll never learn to play this thing.
Now come on, try it again.
Man, there's a voice inside of you...
...that is dying to come out.
Now come on, give me
some of that sweet, sweet music.
Oh, man, anybody got earplugs?
Oh, yeah.
- Everybody's shakin' 'em
- Come on, let's jam
And groove to the beat
You gotta find your feet and swing
- I got to say
- I got to say
- How in love I am
- She's in love
With the music I hear
Everybody's here and sing
- I'm going, I'm going
- Come on in
Join, come on
Make a big line now
Come, come, come on, sing
I have to find my voice too.
I just have to.
Yes.
- Yes.
- Wow! Louie'?
Are you the one making that sound?
I like it.
Play some more.
Thank you, Louie.
I don't know what it is,
but it's really sweet.
Serena!
Hi, Daddy.
Oh, there's Boyd.
Boyd! Maurice here!
Serena!
Serena, say hello to Boyd.
Hi, Boyd.
Well, hello, Serena.
You know, Boyd just happens to be
the best trumpeter in Montana.
Boyd, how about it, huh'?
Let's hear those vocal cords vibrate.
Ko-hoh!
Incredible.
Serena, Serena,
come along, come along.
Boyd is joining us for dinner.
Be on the lookout for a swan thief.
That's him. That's the one.
I'll get you!
Stop, thief!
You are surrounded.
Stop where you are.
It's that swan thief!
They're pursuing me!
They're pursuing me with a vengeance!
They're going to lock me up!
Darling, it was just a dream.
No! Nonsense, no!
They were after me!
With shotguns and footcuffs
and wingwhoppers and...
What's got into you, darling?
Oh, my dear, my dear, my dear,
I am nothing but a common criminal.
A thief!
You see, I procured the trumpet
without paying for it.
You mean you... You...
It is deplorable, but true.
But you did it for love.
But I sacrificed my honour.
Now I will never sleep in peace again.
There, there, dear.
You did it for Louie.
I'm sorry, Father.
I'll get your honour back.
I will.
This is the heart
I never got to give you, Serena.
Goodbye.
I'll miss you.
- Please unpack all your things.
- It's great to be back.
I want to see the girls' cabins.
Louie!
"Need to talk. Urgent."
"My father stole the trumpet."
Your father stole that trumpet'?
Hey, he didn't know.
It was a mistake.
"But now they're after him."
I know, all he needs to do
is pay back the store.
You can get a job and earn
the money to pay for the trumpet.
- A job.
- Now, what are you qualified to do'?
Can you actually play that thing?
That's it!
Hey, hey. hey!
HEY. hey, hey, hey!
Get over there! Put that back!
Hey, you!
Okay, let's go. Put that--
Hey, hey! You, stop that!
That's my foot!
Oh, I need a vacation!
- He's super, isn't he'?
- He can't play the bugle.
He's a waterfowl!
Come on, chief.
Hire him as our camp bugler.
I tell you, it's lousy pay.
That's okay.
He'll take the job anyway.
Okay, he can have the job.
No problem, chief.
Our last bugler left because
he got a rash on his lips.
But don't worry,
you don't have lips.
away.
When I think of that tiny swan
who pulled my shoelace...
I wonder what I'm gonna be
when I grow up.
Wormeater!
You call that a spike, feather breath?
I quit!
All this outdoors!
You all stink too!
Camp!
What a stupid place!
I want my TV.
Oh, no!
Whoa!
Help, I'm drowning!
Help! Help me!
Man overboard!
Help! Somebody help!
Help! I'm drowning!
Great save, Louie!
Hey, swan.
You did okay...
...for a bird.
You're a hero!
Louie! Louie! Louie! Louie!
Louie! Louie! Louie! Louie!
I never knew someone like me
could be a hero.
Oh, man, now that's music.
Sweet, sweet music.
Kum ba yah.
Chief asked me to give you this.
It's your salary.
Is it enough to pay for my trumpet?
Maybe, but not for all the damage
to the store.
You need to earn some big money
for that.
You can't do it around here,
that's for sure.
Big money is in big cities.
Then that's where I'll go.
Okay, campers, see you next summer.
Now, remember what I told you.
Head east.
Check out Chicago...
...or Philadelphia or even Boston.
And go easy on the baked beans.
You're gonna make it, big guy.
You're gonna be somebody.
Look at them!
Isn't spring romantic?!
Get a grip, Apathy. They're crickets.
Oh, that voice!
Every time he sings, I can
feel it in my wishbones.
Oh, you're so lucky, Serena!
He's nuts about you!
Hey, hey, chicks, please, back up.
Gotta talk to the gal here.
Hey, Serena, how about it'?
You, me, doing that wedding thing?
Marriage? Wow.
- Will you excuse me, Boyd'?
- Huh'?
She'd better stop that silly diving
bit and make up her mind.
I'm in demand, you know'?
Oh, you'd be a fool to pass him up.
Oh, yeah, right.
He doesn't even like to dive.
- Are you still hung up on that loser'?
- The one who's never coming back?
He might. You don't know.
Marry Boyd.
Of course she's going to marry Boyd.
But Daddy, I'm not sure--
Show the world that you've something
in your head between your feathers.
But Daddy, shouldn't I be
feeling something more'?
Love grows on you.
That sounds like a fungus.
Serena...
...goto him.
Okay, Boyd-
I'll do it.
I'm yours or you're mine or whatever.
Hey, good call, babe.
Your prince is gonna sing to you
every morning and every single night.
- It'll be bliss.
- I can't wait.
Oh! It's gonna be beautiful.
Oh, no, she accepts!
Man, this is a disaster!
--Getting married!
Get that on the Internut.
Just because we're squirrels doesn't
mean we have no infrastructure.
- Getting married.
- Married.
Getting married.
She's getting married?!
Heartbreak!
Message, message!
Oh!
But first...
...a little snack for the road, maybe?
Acorns!
My favourite!
There it is: Boston.
Oh, hi there, Louie.
I am the senator.
Your grassroots rodent.
My constituents have informed
me of your arrival.
If you need anything, do not
hesitate to contact my aides.
He's nice! For a politician.
What do you say'? Double or nothing?
Hey, that's okay. Plenty more suckers
where you came from.
Forget it, buddy. We got swans up
the wazoo here. Try Philadelphia.
A horn-playing swan!
This I like.
I smell...
...cash. Oh, yes, the green goddess.
Let me introduce myself.
Name is Monty.
I am a highly successful
entrepreneur...
...recently relocated to these parts.
Oh, yeah, this card thing.
That's just a hobby.
You might have some real earnings
potential with that horn there.
Have you considered working
with a manager?
I can help you reel in some big bucks.
For a small fee.
I wish I knew what a manager was.
I get you a gig in one of them swan
boats there. Trust me, swanny.
Be back in half a honk.
Yes, he's a horn-playing swan.
Think about it.
He'll have the tourists flocking
to see this thing.
This is an opportunity
you should not pass.
You got a deal.
We're in, swanny.
We're talking dough for me--
Do Re Mi, pal. Let's go.
WOW!
Taught him everything he knows.
- Incredible!
- The swan's gonna be a star!
Have you heard the music
Across the Boston Lake
Spread the word
There's a brand-new bird
When he blew that trumpet
Everybody came
Now let's cheer, you can't hear
That the people all shout his name
Everybody say
Louie, Louie, Louie
You hit the thing
Baby you're the king
And nothing's gonna stop you now
Everybody sing
And the people all shout
But you better watch out
When Louie starts blowing that horn
Blow it, Louie!
Everybody sing
Louie, Louie, Louie
You're a hit for real
Tell me how it feels
Louie, you're the bomb
Louie, you're the whiz
The leader and the champ
And the best there is
Listen to the people
And the chatter of the birds
Everyone's together
And the reason is because
There's no one else the same
- It's the final stop
- Cause you've reached the top.
Everybody's gonna know your name,
Louie!
You're a hit for real
Tell me, how does it feel
You're the bomb, the whiz
The best there is
No one plays like you, Louie!
Listen to the sound of the rhythm
And the beat
Everybody's singing
And dancing in the street
They love you, Lou. You and me,
we're gonna go far.
One day you'll be on-stage with
the whole darn-tooting Boston Pops!
And I'll be sitting pretty
on a mountain of money.
Lou, where you planning on
spending the night?
Here, on the lake.
I don't think so.
As your agent-slash-manager,
I'm here to protect you too.
Nothing to it.
I got a lot riding on this swan.
This hotel looks pretty fancy.
I don't see any other swans.
Excuse me, monsieur, I'd like a
single room for my client here.
A swan in a hotel? Preposterous!
What are you talking about?
My client's a famous musician!
Nonetheless, we haven't had
great luck with musicians.
What if he trashes the room'?
Or molts in the bed?
And then there's the delicate
matter of...
...lice.
- I think I got a cure for that.
- Oh, I couldn't possibly!
There he is! There's Louie!
Can we have your autograph?
Will you look at that, is this
swan a celebrity or what?
Well...
- Just sign the register, please.
- That's more like it.
Very impressive.
This way, sir.
What's this?
Numbers.
They sure have fizzy pond water here.
This is fun. Serena would love this.
Ah, here we are. Your room service
order, sir.
The kitchen was out of the pond
weeds you requested...
...so our brilliant chef took
the liberty of substituting...
...twelve watercress sandwiches,
hold the bread. Mmm, yummy.
Perhaps you'd like to dine
alfresco, yes?
- He talks funny.
- On the terrace?
Thank you, sir. You are very kind.
Um, extra pillow, sir'?
Oh, dear.
But of course.
You're feather sensitive.
I'll have housekeeping send up a
king-size synthetic straight away.
Very good, sir.
Where are the stars'?
Don't they even have
stars in the city?
Serena
Serena, this is the best
wedding shower.
We're having so much fun.
This is such a lovely twig.
You really shouldn't have.
Wow, muck. Oh, you can never have
enough muck, can you, girls?
Thanks.
Thank you, thank you, not necessary.
Oh, yeah, muck. That's nice too.
Poor Louie.
Oh, I cannot bear to watch this,
my love.
I have sacrificed my honour...
...for naught.
Here we are, Lou. The big show.
I told you I'd take you
right to the top.
Whoa. Before you go out there, Lou...
...I have a little contract drawn up
that I need you to sign.
It's no big deal. You're exclusive
to me for a billion years...
...in this or any other galaxy yet to
be discovered, yada-yada-yada.
Just your standard
gentleman's agreement.
- Should I'?
- Come on, come on, come on.
With the cash you'll rake in,
you'll have enough...
...to buy a shiny new trumpet
and anything else you want.
Enough to repay the music store'?
How can I say no'?
Oh. yes!
Ladies and gentlemen...
...put your hands together for
Louie the trumpeter swan.
Go, Louie!
Bravo, Lou! They loved you. I got you
booked in the stadium on Saturday...
...and I'm very close to
a major network deal.
Here's your salary, kid.
Payday!
There's a new bird in Boston
and his name is Louie.
He's a trumpeter swan that
really plays the trumpet.
Louie!
You did it, Louie! You did it!
You're famous!
You've got a high approval rating,
my friend.
Well done.
Message from the Internut.
- This is terrible news!
- What could it be'?
The message is this:
Your girlfriend is gonna marry
the crooner...
...with the greasy feathers. Right,
tomorrow. I got it! I did it!
Serena and Boyd'?
Why didn't you come sooner?
So blame me. I made
a few nut stops, okay?
Go to her, youngster.
You might be behind in the polls...
...but remember, it's not over until
election day!
Good luck, Louie.
Lou, did you see the--'?
Not so fast, you fern-eating ingrate!
You, Lou, are my property!
You're not going nowhere.
I'll clip those wings
so you'll never fly again!
- He's got scissors!
- I hate scissors!
Hate to do it to you, Louie,
but money is money!
Stop, you!
Hey, you, over here! Hey, me!
Call my aides, I'm going in!
That's all right. I'm unharmed.
Take this!
Get away from me!
Free that swan!
Go, Louie! Fly like the wind!
- Are we nice and comfy there?
- Come on!
Quiet, it's about to start.
Serena, here she comes.
Oh, no!
Traffic!
Whoa! Sorry Mr. Presidents.
I've got to hurry.
Oh, heaven knows...
...I have known sadness
in my lifetime.
But never a sorrow such as this.
Louie will be so...
...heartbroken.
Oh, no, not now.
Do you, Boyd...
...take Serena...
...to be your lifelong mate'?
I do-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
And do you, Serena...
...take Boyd...
...to be your lifelong mate'?
Whoever you are, wait your turn.
I haven't gotten to the part
about objections.
- Louie!
- Louie!
Oh. yeah!
That's beautiful.
- Okay, okay, what does it say'?
- It says that...
...Louie is mine...
...and I am his...
...forever.
So you can talk now, huh'?
Let's see what you have to say
without your stupid horn!
Oh, no, my voice!
There goes your love call, songbird.
Now get off my lake!
And don't come back!
Dangerous curves ahead.
Too bad old Boyd
never learned to read.
Help!
Somebody, help!
Daddy, I love Louie.
And he loves me.
I know, Serena.
I heard him loud and clear.
When the moon would rise
I'd close my eyes
And tomorrow's when
I'd dream again
away
I never heard your music
until today, son.
Now I feel your voice in my heart.
To think I once thought you were...
...defective.
Forgive me, Louie.
How little I knew.
It seems so long ago, that day
in the music store...
...when I took... When I--
Money?
Why are you giving me money'?
To pay for the trumpet.
Oh, Louie, this is the gift
of a lifetime!
Onward, my son...
...to Billings!
Ah, here is Billings.
The scene of my crime.
Thank you, Louie, for giving me
the chance to redeem my honour.
It's that swan thief!
No!
- He's got a gun!
- No! Don't shoot!
Father!
The end is near.
Man, in his folly,
has given me a mortal wound.
Oh, goodbye, beautiful world.
Farewell, sweet springtimes
I have known.
Adieu, loyal wife and loving children.
Now I die.
Gracefully...
...as really...
only a swan...
...can.
He's dead. The bird is dead.
Father.
Oh, Father.
I'm so sorry, Louie.
Look what you've done.
You killed a trumpeter swan.
These birds are endangered!
This endangered bird...
...swiped a trumpet from my store.
"To the storekeeper of Billings...
...enclosed please find
a whole lot of money.
This will be more than enough
to pay for the trumpet...
...and the damage to the store.
I am an honourable swan."
Looks like you made
a big mistake, buddy.
All right, people, stand back.
Could you let us through here,
please? We have an emergency.
It's just a superficial wound.
It is'? What's that? Say what?
He must've just fainted.
I have been at death's door...
...and now...
...I am reviving.
I shall once again glide gracefully...
...on the ponds of the world.
I want this money used to help save...
...the trumpeters.
That's what I'm gonna do
when I grow up.
I promise you, Louie.
I'll protect you.
You're a friend forever.
Darling, you're back.
You're back! How did it go'?
How did it go'?
"How did it go?" you ask.
There was gunfire! There was blood!
No, no, not Louie!
Not to worry, Serena.
It was I who died.
- Serena.
- Louie!
At first, I felt an agonizing pain
in my left shoulder...
...which I've always considered the
more beautiful of my two shoulders.
Blood gushed from my wound
in torrents...
...and I sank gracefully
to the sidewalk.
The police arrived. Dozens of them.
How did you know all this
if you were unconscious?
I wish you wouldn't interrupt when
I'm telling the story of my death.
Oh, of course. But I'm glad to
see you home safe.
I always miss you when you're gone.
Although I was faint,
I passed out with dignity.
My life flashed before me:
The ponds I have known, the winters
I have weathered...
...the summers of my wanton youth.
I was certain my time had come...
...when, suddenly...
...eggs!
My goodness.
Eggs!
That's right, my love.
Louie and Serena...
...are going to have a family.
Octuplets.
- I'm speechless!
- It's about time.
There's nothing in this world
I like more...
...than the sound of the trumpet
of the swan.
How lucky we are to inhabit
this beautiful earth.
How incredible it is to look forward
to another night of sleep...
...and the light that
returns with the day.
I wonder why the sun comes up
every morning after the darkness.
Welcome, my children.
