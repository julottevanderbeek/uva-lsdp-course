Freddy Martin,
an ardent admirer ofthe classics,
inspired by Rimsky-Korsakov´s
""Flight ofthe Bumblebee, ""
has chosen to interpret this
lively fantasy in his own unique style,
##
In a flight
that is fast and furious,
a confused little character
tries desperately to escape
from the hectic harmony,,,
ofan instrumental nightmare,
##
##
##
On the pages ofAmerican folklore,
a legion ofmighty men have left
the symbols oftheir greatness,
There was Paul Bunyan ´s ax;
John Henry´s hammer;
Davy Crockett´s rifle;
and then,
quite unexpectedly,
one comes upon a tin pot hat,
a bag ofapple seed,,,
and a holy book,
And strangely enough,
these are the symbols of one
ofthe mightiest men ofall--
John Chapman,
a real-life pioneer,
With the passingyears, however,
reality has given way to legend,
until today we know this remarkable man
simply as Johnny Appleseed,
This is his story, told by
an old settler who knewJohnny well,
Listen,
Well, sir,
every time I see an apple blossom sky,,,
I think ofJohnny Appleseed,
´cause, of course, them clouds up thar,
they ain ´t really clouds at all,
No, sir,
Why, shucks, there wouldn ´t
be no apple blossom sky,,,
ifit weren ´t for the fact
thatJohnny--
But now, hold on here, Guess I´d better
start back to the beginnin ´,
That´s when Johnny lived
on a farm near Pittsburgh town,
The year was 1 806,
or maybe there around,
Now,just to look at him
you´d sayJohnny Appleseed
never would make a pioneer,
- ##
- He was such a sawed-off,
scrawny little fella,
´Course that didn´t
faze Johnny none,
Shucks, he had his apple trees and
the morning sun and the evening breeze,
- ##
-
# The Lord is good to me #
# And so I thank the Lord #
# For givin´ me
the things I need #
# The sun and rain
and an apple seed #
#Yes,  He´s been good
to me #
##
# I owe the Lord so much #
# For everything I see #
# I´m certain
ifitweren´t for Him #
#There´d be no apples
on this limb #
# He´s been goodto me#
# Oh,  here am I ´neath
the blue,  blue sky #
- # A-doin´ as I please #
-
#Singin´ with
myfeathered friends #
-
- # Hummin´ with the bees #
# I wake up every day #
# As happy as can be #
# Because I know
that with His care #
# My apple trees
theywill still be there #
# Oh,  the Lord
is good to me #
##
Workin´, singin´, carefree andgay,
That´s howJohnny
spent each day,
attendin´ to his apple trees,
But lately littleJohnny here
would feel a stirrin´in the air--
##
a rumblin´, rollin´ underbeat
ofrestless men and restless feet,
# Get on the wagon
rol I i n´ west #
- # There´s plenty of room for you #
- # Plenty of room for you #
# Get on the wagon
rollin´ west #
# Out to the great unknown #
# Get on the wagon
rollin´ west#
# Oryou´ll be left alone #
# We made a home before #
# We´re startin´ out again #
# We ain´t afeared
of man nor beast #
# We´re strong-hearted men #
# So,  get on the wagon rollin´ west #
# Seekin´ a land
that´s new #
# Get on the wagon
rollin´ west#
# There´s plenty ofroom
foryou#
# Get on the wagon
rollin´ west#
# Out to the great unknown #
# Get on the wagon
rollin´ west #
# Oryou´ll be left alone #
# The rivers may be wide
The mountains may be tall #
# But nothin´ stops
the pioneer #
# We´re trailblazers all #
# So,  get on the wagon
rollin´ west #
# Out to the great unknown #
# Get on the wagon
rollin´ west #
- # Or-- #
-
# Oryou´ll be left alone#
# You´ll be left alone ##
PoorJohnny,
He weren´t no pioneer,
and he knowed it,
It was alljust pretend,
and them folks goin´ west
to build this nation,,,
sure made pickin´apples look like
a plumb useless occupation,
- ##
- Well, sir, that´s when
a miracle happened,
""Well, what´s holdin ´ya,Johnny?, ""
says a voice,
""Go on, Go on out west,
ifthat´s your choice, ""
Well, sir,
it was an angel,
Johnny´s own private
guardian angel,
Might look mighty queersome
to you and me,
but, you know, that´s just the way
John figured he ´d be,
Wel l,  speak up,  boy.
Don´t stand there gawki n´.
U nlock your jaw
and get to talkin´.
Y-Y-Yes,  sir--
Yes,  sir!.
Why don´t I go west?.
´Cause I ain´t got
the muscle...
nor the breadth ofchest,
Out tharit´s the strong men
who survive,
and I´m about
the puniest feller alive.
Shame to ya, Johnny.
You got faith and courage
and a level head.
But,  shucks,
you see,  sir,
all I know is...
apple trees.
And what´s wrong with apples,
ifyou please?.
Ain´t they ´bout the finest fruit
in all the land?.
Why,  shoot,  man,
they take the cake.
Just think, Johnny,
of all the things
that apples make.
There´s,  uh,
apple pickles.
# Oh-so-tastyapple tarts
andapple pastry#
# Apple dumplings
Not to mention-- #
- Applesauce?.
- Yes!
# And there´s apple fritters
light as thistle #
# And for folks
to wet their whistle #
# Tangy apple cider in a glass #
Stew ´em,  fry ´em,
boil ´em,  bake ´em.
- Apple pie and apple cake ´em.
- Yep!
# You can cook ´em
any way#
# There´s apple this
andapple that#
#The recipes´d
fill yer hat #
#Why,  I could carry on
like this all day #
# So,  packyer stuff
and git a-goin´ #
# Git them apple trees
a-growin´ #
#There´s a lot ofwork
out there to do #
#There´s a lot ofwork to do #
- Yes,  sir!.
- ##
I mean,  no,  sir.
Yousee, sir, I ain´t got the traps,
ain´t got the gear,,,
ornone ofthe things
I´ll need out there,
You ain´t got the--
Dadgum it,  boy,
I´m ashamed ofyou.
You got the stuff
to see you through.
Why,you got
all the seedsyou´re needin´,
and for pretty darn good
readin´...
#There ain´t nothin´ finer
than your book #
Here´s a mighty handy bonnet.
Even got a handle on it.
#Turn it upside-down
and you can cook#
# So,  come on,  son
and git a-goin´ #
# Git them apple trees
a-growin´ #
#There´s a lot
ofwork out there to do #
# Oh,  there´s a lot ofwork
to do ##
Well, sir, that´s howit all began,
That´s howJohnny,
all alone,
set out to meet
the great unknown,
´Twas a mighty big
and fearsome place,,,
for a man to face,
A little man, and all alone,
without no knife,
without no gun,
And though the forest
is dark and wide,,,
with fearsome critters
on every side,
Johnnyjust kept walkin ´ on,
Walked until at last he found
a little spot of open ground,,,
with fertile soil
and warmsome breeze,
a likely place
for apple trees,
Now, the varmints here,
they couldn ´t know,,,
ifJohn was friend
orJohn was foe,
so some took off
in sudden flight,,,
and some got set
to claw and bite,
But ifJohnny seen ´em
he paid no heed,
Just got busy
a-plantin´apple seeds,
##
##
Now, them varmints
come from everywhere,,,
to watch that man
a-diggin´ there,
Didn´t like
what they was seein´,
Didn´t trust
no human bein´,
##
Yep, that ornery human
had to go,
But who was a-gonna
tell him so?,
Well, not a soul
could answer that,,,
till here come along
a black-and-white cat,
Now, he weren´t too bright,
but he didn´t much care,
He knowed he had
a certain ai r... about him,
##
##
Well, sir, that done it,
The critters ne´er seed
the beat ofthat,
the likes ofa human
a-likin´ that cat,
Why, shucks, this little man had
went and busted every precedent,
He was the very first
to come,,,
without no knife,
without no gun,
And so it was,
from that time on,
every last livin ´ varmint
was a friend to John,
- ##
- They surely was,
# The Lord is good to me #
# And so I thank the Lord #
# For givin´me
the things I need#
# The sun and rain
and an apple seed#
# Yes, He´s been good to me ##
Well, as time went byJohnny kept
right on a-plantin´his apple trees,,,
and makin´ friends everywhere,
and his best friends
was the pioneers,,,
for, of course,John was plantin´more
than an apple tree,
He was plantin´his own
boundless faith and courage too,
and that give folks new heart,
new hope in the job they had to do,
As more and more pioneers
come to push back the forest,
the kindly deeds
oflittle Johnny Appleseed,,,
spread throughout the land,
and more ´n once, with
a good old-fashionedjubilee,
folks would honorJohnny Appleseed
and the fruit ofthe apple tree,
##
# Swi ng and come
right out to the right of the ring #
# I nside arch
and the outside under #
# I nside arch
and the outside under #
# ´Tain´t gonna rain
without no thunder #

# Chicken in the breadpan
pickin´ out dough #
# Big pig a-rootin´ out
a little tater row #
# And a-one more change
then home we go #
##
Now, sometimes
ifJohn was a-passin´by,,,
he´d mosey over and kinda
look in on the doin´s,
´cause it sure tickled him to see
how the fruit ofhis labors,,,
brought all kinds offolks together
and made ´em good neighbors,
# Now duck for the apple

- How´d you like some applesauce?.
Yes, ma´am!
Yup,Johnny did
bring folks a heap ofhappiness,
But, shucks, he weren´t
lookin´ for thanks,
Didn´t have time fer it,
He knowed a man
can´t take no rest,,,
ifhe aims to plant the whole
darn wilderness in apple trees,
And so it was--
for more´n 40 year,,,
John walked and planted
that old frontier,
Yes, sir, 40 years
of walkin ´ and plantin ´,
And in that space
oftwoscore year,,,
this little man, he throwed his shadow
clear across the land,
across 1 00, 000 miles square,
And in that shadow
everywhere,,,
you´ll find he left
his blessin ´s three:
# Love and faith #
# And the apple tree #
Boy,  for sleepi n´
you take the cake.
Come on. Git up!
We got a longsome
trip to make,
Oh,  why,  Mr. Angel.
Howdy do?.
I´m fine,
And how beyou?
I´m fine.
J ust feelin´--
Whoop!
Who is that,
sleepin´ in the evenin´ dusk?.
Why,  that´s just your husk, John.
Your mortal husk.
My husk?.
You mean to say I´m--
I´m passed away?.
Dagnab it,  Angel,
I just can´t go!
Got crops to harvest,
seeds to sow,
Now,  now,  hold on,  boy.
Down here on Earth
your work is through,
but yonder,
well,  we need ya,  Johnny.
Yep, we sure do,
You´d think we had
most all we please,
but we ain´t.
We´re kinda short
on apple trees.
Well,  I swan!
I didn´t know!
What are we waitin´ fer?.
Come on! Let´s go!
# We´re wastin´time
Let´s git it goin´#
# Git them apple trees
a-growin´ #
#There´s a lot ofwork up there to do #
# Oh,  there´s a lot
ofwork to do #
Well, sir,
nowyou know the reason why,,,
whenever I see
that certain sky,,,
I think oflittleJohn,
´Cause it´s like I said,
ifyou´ll recall:.
Them clouds
ain´t really clouds at all,
They´re apple blossoms,
ifyou please,
from John ´s heavenly orchard
ofapple trees,
# Ohh, and some may hail
the apples there #
# For everyone in the world
to share #
# The Lord is good to me ##
There ´s drama, there ´s excitement,,,
and there ´s harmony
for three,,,
in the story ofadventure
on the sea,
Now, featured in this epic,,,
is a ship ofproud design,
No, it´s not
this ocean liner,
We take a different line,
So, with a huffand a puff
and a chug-chug-chug,,,
and a perky little hoot,
we introduce our hero,
the tugboat Little Toot,
-
# Little Toot was just a tug #
-
-#Just a happy harbor tug #
-
# And he came from a line
oftugboats fine and brave #
- # But it seems that Little Toot #
-
-# Simply didn´t give a hoot #
-
# Though he tried to be good
he never could behave #
-# Chug-a-chug-chug, heave-ho, my lad#
-
# I´m a big toot
just like my dad#
-# Pull big boats
with the old heave-ho #
-
# And away we go #
# Chug-a-chug, chug-chug
Chug-a-chug, chug-chug #
# Chug-a-chug, chug-chug
Chug-a-chug, chug-chug #
Whee!
- # He made the ocean liners wait #
-
-# While he made a figure eight #
-
# With the greatest of ease
he´d cut through the seas #
# And sli-i-i-ide #
-# But he went too far one day #
-
# When he slid in Big Toot´s way #
# And it wasn´t a joke for it
nearly broke Big Toot´s pride #
# Won´tyou ever grow up
Little Toot #
# Won´tyou ever grow up
Little Toot #
# When there´s work
to be done #
# Allyou think ofis fun #
# Won´tyou ever grow up
Little Toot #
# Ohhh #
# Little Toot
had quite a scare #
# He decided then and there #
# That he´d try to be good#
-# As good as he could be #
-
# So when his dad
came puffin´slow #
# With a mighty ship in tow #
# Little Toot went to help him
take it out to sea #
# Chug-a-chug-chug
Heave-ho, my lad#
-# I´m a big tootjust like my dad#
-
# Push big boats
with the ol´heave-ho #
-
-# And away we go #
# Chug-a-chug, chug-chug
Chug-a-chug, chug-chug #
# Chug-a-chug, chug-chug
Chug-a-chug, chug-chug # Whoo!
-
-
-
-
# Won´tyou ever grow up #
# Little Toot#
# Won´tyou ever grow up #
# Little Toot #
# When you get into trouble #
# You get into it double #
# Won´tyou ever #
# Grow up #
# Little Toot #
# What a shame #
# What a shame #
# You´ve disgraced
your father´s name #
# Won´tyou ever #
# Grow up #
# Little Toot #
-
-
Bad boy.
Bad boy.
Shame!
Shame!
Too bad.
Too bad.
Hmmph!
Hmmph!
-
-# He was drifting all around#
# When a storm
came crashing down #
# In the billowing sea
he tossed and tossed and tossed#
# And his heart was filled
with fear #
# For he knew
the rocks were near #
# With the waves in pursuit
Little Toot knew all was lost #
# Then he saw
a rocket´s flare #
# Come a-bursting
in the air #
# And he suddenly knew
that he must do or die #
# For a ship
was in distress #
# And as he puffed
an ""S, O,S, ""#
# He raced to the rescue
ofthe ship nearby #
Try, try, try,
Do or die, do or die,
Do or die, do or die,
-# Well, it seems you´ve grown up
Little Toot #
-
# Toot Toot, you´re a brave
You´re a brave, brave Little Toot #
-# Can´tyou hear that cheerin´ crowd#
-
# You have made
your daddy proud#
# You are now a big toot
Little Toot #
# Yes, you´re now
a great big toot #

There´s poetry in trees, they say,
and, well, one day
a poet found it,
Then a music master
wove around it,,,
melody,
An artist touched it,
gave it form in colors rich and warm,
And now we bring to you
these three:.
poem, picture, melody,
A simple tribute
to a tree,
# I think that I shall never see #
# A poem lovely as a tree #
# A tree whose hungry mouth #
# Is pressed#
# Against the earth ´s
sweet flowing #
# Breast #
# A tree that looks #
# At God#
# All day #
# And lifts her leafy arms #
# To pray #
# The tree that may in summer wear #
# A nest ofrobins
in her hair #
# Upon whose bosom
snow has lain #
# Who intermitt´ly
lives with rain #
# Poems are writ #
# By fools like me #
# But only God#
# Can make #
# A #
# Tree ##
The intoxicating rhythm ofthe samba,
A talented miss serves up
a musical cocktail,,,
with a true
Latin-American flavor,
So ifthree boisterous
birds ofa feather,,,
fall under the influence
ofthis torrid tropical tempo,
don´t blame them-- blame it
on the rhythm ofthe samba,
##
# Ifyour spirits
have hit a new low #
-# And they long to hit #
-
-# A new high #
-
- # One little musical cocktail #
-
-# Will lift them to the sky #
-
# Mix ajigger ofrhythm #
# With the strain
ofa few guitars #
# Add a dash ofthe samba #
# And a few melodious #
-# Bars #
-##
# And then #
# And there #
- # You take a small cabaca
Chi-chi-chi-chi chi #
-
# One pandiero
Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha #
# Take the cuica
Choo-choo-choo-choo #
# You´ve got the fascinating
rhythm ofthe samba #
# And ifguitars are strumming
Chi-chi-chi-chi-chi #
# Birds are humming
Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha #
# Drums are drumming
Choo-choo-choo-choo #
# Then you can blame it
on the rhythm ofthe samba #
# For there is somethin ´
´bout the beat you cling to #
# Not the type ofsong
you sing to #
# But the kind ofthing
you swing to #
# When you get to bouncin´
with the beat in your feet #
# For when you´re bouncin´
to the beat, you´re reelin´#
# With the carioca feelin´#
# But ifyou want
to hit the ceilin´#
# Here is
allyou have to do #
- # You take a small cabaca #
-
-# One pandiero #
-
# Take a cuica #
# You´ve got the fascinating
rhythm ofthe samba #
##
##
# A pick-a-pocket Casablanca
is a cuica,  choo-choo #
# And thenyou really got
the barorundi samba #
# And ifyou tell a proper guy
that he´s cabaca,  chi-chi #
# Well, then he´ll turn around
and tellyou I´m pandiero,  cha-cha #
# And ifhe doesn´t turn around
then he´s a cuica,  choo-choo #

just the way the old-timers
used to tell ´em,
Accordin´ to them,
Pecos Bill was the roughest, toughest,

shootin ´-est cowpoke that ever lived,
Well, any story about ol´ Pecos
is bound to be right strong medicine,
so maybe it´s best to sashay into it
kinda gentle-like,

- Yep,  they´re coyotes. Bobby´s right.
- They always howl
when the moon is bright.
- Why?.
Well, that´s quite a story,
- Cowboys in it?.
- Yes, sirree,
- I njuns too?.
- Well,  could throw in
maybe two or three.
But mostly this story
is about Pecos Bill.
- Pecos Bill?. Who´s he?.
-##
- What?. Never heard of Pecos Bill?.
- Imagine that.
Why,  I thought everybody
knowed Pecos.
Why,  Bobby,
I´m surprised at you.
Bill was the world´s
greatest buckaroo.
# He was the roughest, toughest critter
Never known to be a quitter #
# ´Cause he never had no fear
for man nor beast #
- Yep,  that there Pecos Bill was--
-
Easy,  Trigger.
I´m not forgettin´ Bill´s horse.
Why,  shucks,
I couldn´t forget Widowmaker.
- Widowmaker?.
-  That´s a funny name.
But that horse earnedit
just the same,
- He was a killer.
- Dynamite on the hoof.
Yep,  Widowmaker
was Bill´s best pal,
until along came
that beautiful prairie gal.
- Aw,  shucks. A woman in the story.
- But what a woman.
# She was fresh
as the dew#
# On a prairie rose #
# A true thoroughbred #
# From her head
to her toes #
#That there
was Slewfoot Sue #
# Sweet Sue #
Slewfoot Sue. Huh!
I´d rather hear about the coyotes.
Yes,  Uncle Roy,
you started to say--
Why the coyotes howl
at the moon that way?.
You´re right,  honey,
but it all fits together.
Can´t tell one
without the other,
because the story of Bill
and that Slewfoot gal...
is the story of coyotes
and why they howl.
I´m gettin´ down
to the details right now.
Now,  here on the map
ofthe old U.S.,
completely surrounded
bywilderness,  lies Texas.
- Amen,
- ´Course,  there´s some other
states scattered around.
- Yeah, like Wyoming,
- Milwaukee,
-And Long Island Sound,
- Right,
Down Texas way a river flows,
Where it comes from,
nobody knows,
Where it´s a-goin´
don´t no one care,
Just doggone glad
it´s a-leavin´ there,
- That there´s the Pecos River,
- She was pure alkali,
Just naturally mean water,
Why, the buzzards
won ´t even touch it,
-##
- Into this fertile garden spot,,,
once there come
a prairie cart,
-
- There was Ma and Pa and 1 6 brats,
four hound dogs--
Yeah, and a couple of cats,
All a-goin´ west,
lookin´ for elbow room,
Sure could use
some ofthe same,
Crossin´ the Pecos River bed,
somethin´ fell out and lit on his head,
Folks didn´t even know
he was gone,
Ol´ wagon just kept
a-rollin´along,
Yep, it was Bill,
Poor little critter,
Homeless as a poker chip,
# ´Long came night
and a prairie moon #
# Old Ma Coyote
a-hurryin ´ home #
# She was due for a shock
at herjourney´s end#
# Fer the stork
had delivered a dividend#
Plumb unusual!
Yep,
´Tain´t never happened before,
-Probably one ofthem newfangled models,
-
# Bill looked up
and then he grinned#
Shucks!
# Ma´s ol´heart
just plumb caved in #
# Bill seen right off
that he needn´t fear #
# He´d staked himself
a claim right here #
Headed straight
for that old chuck wagon,
Yep, ol´ Bill was hungrier
than a woodpecker with a headache,
And so it follered
as a natural fact,,,
- that Bill growed up
with that coyote pack,
-
He soon become
the main top hand,,,
in a way they all
could understand,
But little Bill,
he couldn´t rest,,,
till he´d proved hisself
the A- 1 best,
So he studied
the other varmints too,
then showed ´em all
a trick or two,
Outloped the antelope,
Outjumped the jackrabbit,
Yeah, Bill even outhissed
the rattlesnake,
# Then one day #
# ´Cross the burnin´sand#
# A stranger come #
# To the Pecos land#
# The usual committee #
# Was there today #
# To welcome their guest #
-# In #
-
# The usual way #
Now, 50 to 1 weren´t
no fair fight,
but one plus Bill
made itjust about right,
Well, it was the beginning
ofa beautiful friendship,
From that time on
them two stuck together,,,
Iike warts on a toad,
like birds ofa feather,
When Bill growed up,
it was natural, of course--
he ´d choose a career
to suit him and his horse,
Yep, Bill become
a rootin ´, tootin ´ cowboy,
Ya-hoooo!
Ya-hoooo!
# Ohhhh #
# Pecos Bill was quite a cowboy
down in Texas #
# And the western superman
to say the least #
# He was the roughest
toughest critter #
# Never known
to be a quitter #
# ´Cause he never had no fear
ofman nor beast #
# So yippee-i-yay
I-yay #
# Yippee-i-ohh #
# Fer the toughest critter
west ofthe Alamo #
-# So yippee-i-yay, i-yay #
-##
-# Yippee-i-ohh I-ohh #
- ##
##
# Once there was a drought
that spread all over Texas #
# So to sunny Californy
he did go #
# And though the gag
is kinda corny #
# He brought rain
from Californy #
# That´s the way we got
the Gulf ofMexico #
# So yippee-i-yay
I-yay #
# Yippee-i-ohh #
# Fer the toughest critter
west ofthe Alamo #
# Once a band ofrustlers
stole a herd of cattle #
-
-# But they didn´t know #
# The herd they stole
was Bill´s #
# And when he caught
them crooked villains #
# Pecos knocked out
all their fillin´s #
# That´s the reason why there´s
gold in them thar hills #
-# So yippee-i-yay
-# I-yay #
-# Yippee-i-ohh #
- # I-ohh #
# Fer the toughest critter
west ofthe Alamo #
# Ohh, Pecos lost his way #
- # While travelin ´ on the desert #
- # Water #
# It was 90 miles #
# Across the burnin ´sand#
# Water #
# He knew he´d never
reach the border #
# Water #
# Ifhe didn´t get some water #
# Water #
# So he got a stick
and dug the Rio Grande #
##
# While a tribe
ofpainted Indians #
# Did a war dance #
# Pecos started shootin´ up
their little game #
# He gave them redskins
such a shake-up #
# That theyjumped out
from their makeup #
# That´s the way the Painted Desert
got its name #
# So yippee-i-yay
I-ohh #
-# Fer the toughest critter
west ofthe Alamo #
- Ohh!
-
- # While reclinin´ on a cloud
high over Texas #
# With his gun
he made the stars evaporate #
# Then Pecos saw
the stars declinin ´#
# So he left one
brightly shinin ´#
# As the emblem of
the Lone Star Texas state #
# So yippee-i-yay
I-yay #
# Yippee-i-ohh #
- Yep, them was happy days
fer Bill and that hoss,
-
Looked like nothin´
could ever come between ´em,
Then it happened,
Now, Bill was happy
that fateful day,
a-killin´some time
in his carefree way,
inventin´a one-man rodeo,,,
a-buttin´heads
with the buffalo,
Poor Bill,
Yeah, happy as a hog
in a turnip patch,
And then old man Fate started
dealin´ from the bottom ofthe deck,
for down the stream
come Slewfoot Sue,,,
with all her charms
revealed to view,
Looked like somethin´
from out´n a dream--
first female woman
Bill´s ever seen,
##
- She was strange,
- Unusual,
Yeah, but
powerful stimulatin´,
Like a slug ofrye
on an empty stomach,
# Give ´im
a right peculiar feelin´#
# Set his senses
plumb to reelin´#
-# With a poundin´sound
inside his ears #
-
# Like the gallopin´hooves
ofa thousand steers #
# Inside his chest
was a-seethin´and churnin´#
# His blood was a-boilin´
His brain was a-burnin´#
# A-burnin´ with the fires
that could only be cooled#
# In the beckoning depths #
# Oftwo blue, limpid pools #
Yep, I ´amour had come
to Pecos Bill,
Yahoo!
Widowmaker was plumb puzzled,
Looked like trouble to him,
and he sure was right,
Bill was busy inventin´ courtin´,
western-style,
# He arranged for the moon #
# To rise just right #
# And flood the land#
# With a silvery light #
# Ordered the stars #
# In heaven above #
# To form a token #
# Ofundying love #
# Then, ´cross the sky #
# In words offire #
# Bill told sweet Sue #
# Ofhis own heart´s #
# Desire #
# Sweet Sue #
# I love #
-
-# You ##
And so Sue named
the wedding day,
but there was a price
Bill had to pay,
Sue wanted a bustle--
the finest, of course--
and she aimed to be wedded
a-ridin´ Bill´s horse,
Well, Sue got her bustle
and it sure was classy,
Put the finishin ´ touch
on that sweet gal´s chassis,
Why, that there happy,
blushin ´ bride,,,
was a-bustin ´ out
with girlish pride,
##
But Bill had promised Slewfoot Sue
a ride on Widowmaker too,
- Would that horse be willin´
to let Sue ride?
-
Well, here comes the answer--
fit to be tied,
Widowmaker was plumb irritated,
But it didn ´t
bother Sue none,
She walked right up
to that critter´s side,
Her gentle hand touched
his bristlin ´ hide,
Her foot found the stirrup, With a flick
ofher bustle, Sue was aboard,
- And sought for the tussle,
-
The proceedin ´s
begun to commence,,,
forthwith,
No doubt about it.
That there Sue was
a regular female buckaroo.
And then, that bustle--
Underneath them frills
and flounces,
Sue was developin´
plenty ofbounces,
Got to be more´n that gal
could handle,
and Sue took off
like a Roman candle,
That devilish contraption
ofsteel and wire,,,
kept bouncin´ that poor gal
higher and higher,
Soon it was plain
to the multitude,,,
that Sue was
a-gainin´altitude,
Sure looked like
she was a goner,
But no,
Here come a ray ofhope,
Look! I t were Bi I l
and his trusty rope.
He´d durn soon
put a stop to this,
- Shucks, Bill was never knowed to miss,
-
Bill was calm, confident,
He built his loop
with careless ease,
He judged his distance,
tested the breeze,
Then a whirl and a twirl
and a twist ofthe wrist,
He let ´er go,,,
but the champeen missed,
How it come to happen,
nobody could ever figure out,
##
She was offagain
on her heavenly flight,
Up, up she went,
clean out ofsight,
till far into space
this unfortunate maid,,,
finally come to the moon,
and that´s where she stayed,
In the state ofTexas,
U,S,A,,
Iife still goes on
in the same old way,,,
and the Pecos River
still flows on,
but the greatest cowboy
on Earth,,,
is gone,
Yeah, Bill went back
to the coyotes,
but he never forgot Sue,
And every night,
when the moon ris´high,
he´d lift his voice
in mournful cry,
-
- Bewailin´ the fate ofhis lady fair,
his long lost love
in the sky up there,
-
- So painful was his griefto see,
the varmints joined in
out ofsympathy,
And that´s how come,
to this very day,
coyotes howl at the moon
that way,
- # Move along #
- # Move along #
# Bl ue shadows #
- # Move along #
- # Move along,  move along,  move along #
# Soon the dawn will come #
# And you´ll be
on yourway #
# On yourway #
# But until #
#The darkness #
# Sheds its veil #
#There´ll be
blue shadows #
# On the trail #
# Shadows on #
#The trail ##
