Government Officer Mr. Laghu Duo,
l'm Vilas Pardesi aka Billu.
Village Budbudha,
Lala Lajpal has visited here,
Have you seen my Billu Saloon,
and if you seen then it's good,
because l'm writing this letter on
the behalf of this shop, my shop's
condition is same as your government,
ln the name of asset l have
somethings,
like a chair what my naughty children
calls Swinger,
some day it will be break and it will
break customer's butt,
a scissor who never cuts anyone,
A comb who looks like an old man jaw,
it's one teeth is here and one is
there,
So l am requesting you for loan to
purchase new accessories,
l'm sure you will think that why l'm
directly not talking to you.
l came here, and l'm counting bees
sitting outside on broken bench,
But l've heard government files doesn't
move without weight,
And l don't have any idea about bribe.
And l don't want to mess it all,
that's why l am asking you in written,
that will you take bribe,
lf your answer is yes then l'll tell
you l don't have money,
And if your answer is no, then you
call me inside,
Your upcoming customer,
Billu.
An idiot is sitting outside,
Send him inside,
Greetings! Team DUS Jay78
May l come in?
Please come,
Mr. Gandhi,
Mr. Dharam Raj,
How could they come,
they are gone, they are died,
l came alone,
that's why l am respecting you,
All those great souls are gone,
But it's my pleasure to meet you,
Directly ask to Government Officer,
that will you take bribe or not,
Amazing!
A man of principles like you is
eligible for praise not for loan,
No, lf that bribe line hurts your
feelings,
then l'll cut that line,
Abuse is like a children's ball,
that you through it on the wall and
catch it back,
Go you great soul,
You won't get any loan,
Pandit Jee, something for that
rolling chair,
You will always wander,
but you won't get loan,
Thanks!
for what?
You should never ask straight to
any government officer
will you take a bribe,
You have teach me this lesson,
Out!
Out!
Why you people are sitting outside,
Electricity is not coming or what.
That's why we put the lamp, electricity
department have cut our electricity,
Okay,
No problem, it's a good thing,
Big people like Mahatma Gandhi,
were study in lamp light all night,
so what they did in days,
They went to school,
They helped their parents for work,
Yes, even Mr. Abraham Linkon studied
in street lamps,
From tomorrow l'll go to street,
You don't understand anything,
Where is your mom,
She is gone to get some oil.
Naughty, you're talking about your
mom,
She is really gone for get oil,
To our neighbour Mina Mosi,
You didn't brought the grains,
No, l came out from shop but entire
market was closed,
Tell the truth, nobody has come for
hair cut,
No,
l had some customers,
l paid our house rent,
Now happy,
Very happy,
Now give him another good news,
Which one,
Principle has called you school
tomorrow,
Why?
lt's a good news,
Greetings,
Bindya was saying that if today....
fees won't be submit then you will
restigate them,
Out, office is outside,
go and submit your fees outside,
l couldn't bring the money,
Have you brought your memory,
Look, last time you beg to me that's
why l made you a promise,
Today l fulfill that promise,
One month's fee hasn't come that's
why l restigate your childrens,
But how it worth?
We will see what it worths?
Sister, if you will restigate children
from school then there will be 2 things
First, your school fee will be stuck,
because how money will come to me,
Second, children's studies will be
stuck.
You can save one thing to stuck
between both of them,
Which one?
Studies.
What?
l swear, l have broke my all piggy
banks,
look, l've got one rupee,
Now when l went to sell my goat then
my wife shouts,
then let your childrens teach from
goat,
Shall l send my goat here,
First you will teach my goat and then
goat will teach my childrens,
Then you will ask goat's fee,
You're making me fool,
Who started that?
Get out from here,
You were walking with heavy feets
in school.
like you have a lot of money in your
pocket,
and you will pay our school fees,
But l told you l'll arrange soon,
l am happy, l don't have to listen
your same speech daily,
Bring first number,
But l buy you all the books,
What if they take you out from school,
Learn outside from the window,
Then what is the need to come school.
We can study at home,
To wash same uniform mom's back
won't pain,
But you have to go school for exams,
Why you came to my shop every
morning,
Listen what happened today this
dharmendra has lost today,
He will give me a crore,
What?
Whose hand he will turn?
Not turn, idiot crore,
lt's one crore,
These losers are playing of crores on
street and don't have a single penny,
But it satisfies our selves,
You watch your empty safe all day long
That's why you are always upset,
Can't you find another place for play,
Where we will find a batter place than
that, nobody comes here,
This peace is embarassing for me,
Today l have oil then shine your self,
But from tomorrow, no oil for you,
and there is no guarantee from
tomorrow,
And this is the last trick, after
that you hold my ship.
How ship will reach to corner,
This Modern Madan is a problem here,
Since Modern Madan's shop has open,
Billu's scissors are stopped,
Nowadays, it's a trend of exposure,
Madan has made his shop like
Rakhi Sawant,
And his shop is like old Neerupa Rai,
All budbude's hair has cut in that
saloon,
Do something, Billu Bhai.
Pagla
Hey!
Hold your tongue,
l said next,
l have many customers here, l don't
have time for waste,
Next!
Hey!
Look!
Old Rate, New Rate.
Cutting rate from fifteen rupees to
ten rupees,
What is this billu's next trick?
Don't know it is the cheap price of
billu,
or nothing,
Shut the engine,
Petrol is very expensive,
Then totally it is 2750,
What he is doing here?
Call him up here,
Hey, Billu!
come here.
Mr. Dumchand is calling you.
How many times l told you damchand,
don't you understand once,
What should l do?
l didn't kept your name that's why....
from today write daily for 101 times,
damchand, damchand, damchand,
and still you can't call, then don't
come on work from tomorrow,
Greetings!
greetings!
Your saloon has closed now you will
cut wood on my body,
l needed a new chair that's why....
Oh! your time has changed,
Your busniess is running good,
Where?
But planning is necessary in life,
that's why l understand the estimate
of chair,
From today l will save my money
then l will order,
So, you don't need a chair and you
don't have money,
No, l don't need it right now,
l don't have money,
Then why did you break my legs,
Do you think l am a fool?
Billu!
lt's a matter of timing,
Those people's business is running
good,
they all took money on interest from
me, but you didn't...
that's why your business is not
running.
Look, don't worry,
Get some cash and forget the timing,
Just give me interest.
lf l ain't get yet then how l will
get now,
My life will ruined because of your
interest,
Leave it,
then what are you doing here?
Take him out,
No, you don't need it,
l will go,
Give me the wood,
Give me the wood,
get lost.
Don't have a single penny in pocket
and watching colorful dreams,
lt's super hit Sahir Jee,
You write it down,
First let him write the rest of the
story,
then write down the fate of film,
Jerry!
Film's flow is good till here,
but what next,
Sir, We have seen a view of one
brother who lived on sky,
then he came out to search his
twin brother,
And real film starts from here.
And the search should be the soul
of the film,
Because every man is searching for
something,
Someone is searching for name,
someone is searching for fame,
someone is searching for money,
and someone is searching....
....for some moments of peace.
You know....
...if this journey of search
we can make it interesting then we
will enjoy the film.
Otherwise in the story of twin
brothers meeting and take apart
what is the new idea?
Sir, locket!
Locket's idea is new,
Very original.
Since childhood a locket like remote
is tied on both brother's neck,
and if one brother touch that locket
then it sounds beep in another's neck
Yes. sir.
We have kept some feeling of technology
ln the climax with that sound of beep
they both search each other.
Do people will beleive on that,
l am sure they will.
l must appreciate your confidence,
and for your courage too.
So much security.
What is this new conspiracy.
Not at all.
Like every successful man l'm paying
for my successful life,
To watch my last picture some
polititions become against on me,
and they become anger on me,
They said....
that we took the side of one community
and neglect their community,
l took a stand and tell them watch the
picture and tell me where is the
mistake, nobody has no answer, even
one politition start telling me
that Mr. Sahir we are like magician
like they brings things from empty
hat and we bring the problems, and
this time l was their target.
lntelligence told me that it could be
dangerous for my life, so it started,
By the way where these twin brothers
are going to meet.
ln the village, that's why one brother
is belong to the sky and other one is
from village, that's why l kept the
movie's title ''Aasman ka Farishta
aur khoon ka rishta''.
You've become so commercial.
By the way in which village you are
going to shoot.
Let's see.
We will find it,
Shoot it in Budbuda Village.
Yes, Sir.
Budbuda!
l've heard it's a nice village.
Bindiya!
Yes!
You came to borrow grain, you made a
promise and disappeared,
You told me that you will give goat's
milk daily, what happened.
What should l do?
Her child drunk all the milk,
then tie them seperate.
l can't tie them seperate, they both
can't live without each other.
lt's just a child,
Just wait for a week,
l'll send you the milk,
This couple is like this, Man carry
money and wife carrys stuff.
Drive slowly,
You don't need to drive fast.
Stop right here.
Carefully!
Some postman was looking for me,
Nobody never finds you,
Not today l've never seen anyone
searching for you.
Why are you laughing?
Someone is dancing naked here.
They laugh unnecessarily.
My poet has print in Gazal Sagar.
and l was expecting it's money order.
Where did you get these flowers?
Did you get married?
Where is the bride?
l've left her hospital for delivery.
You jusy play your games,
Government gave me respect,
For what?
They held up a programme for Gas,
l narrate them such a nice poetry,
people were clapping for me,
You should watch if you would be
there.
l'll narrate you too just order for
tea.
You narrate your poetry in Madan's
shop then l'll get you tea,
Atleast few of them will come from
there.
Tell, whom l have to beat,
Shut up!
Look! what's written on there?
Message, Shave, Cutting.
l'll get everything.
Mr. Damchand, you just got cutting
few days before, let them grow.
but if he will high his prices then...
l'll get more short hair,
and l don't have to spend money soon,
And will he cut proper?
Why he won't?
that day you insult him,
think! your neck is on his chair.
Scissor on his hand, to take avenge
if he cut your ear and throat,
and say sorry then.....
So what?
l'll break his legs.
What is the worth to beat him when
he cut my ears.
then we will beat him first and then
let him allow for your hair cut.
You dumb!
You want me to slap you.
Billu! from today it's your
responsibilty to cut my hair.
Look, l have come here....
Carefully!

He broke my chair's tyre,
and his back too.
Let's take him to the hospital.

Nobody of us didn't imagine that,
ln a small village like budbuda a
great celebrity will come,
and it will come face to face,
To listen Mr. Sahir's name in front
of our eyes all those moments come
what he played in his different roles,
Mr. Sahir is the biggest star of our
country.
and l don't need to issue any
certificate of that thing,
Move fast,
My greetings to everyone,
and lot of love,
this film's shooting has suppose to be
in some village,
and unfortunately l called up your
village name,
Budbudha,
l've heard in childhood that your
village is a nice place,
Principle said it right,
l really never thought to come between
all of you people,
l'll become a part of your land,
Actually, what human thinks about
his life,
it's not necessary that God has also
thinks the same,
that's why someone has said,
lf you want to make laugh God then
as a joke
tell him your future plannings,
Anyway, first of all,
l'm appologizing you from the bottom
of my heart,
that you people couldn't see our
shooting properly,
Actually, my last movie was little
bit controvercial,
and because of that government gave
me much security,
Just because of this security what
problems you people faced,
Believe it, l'm facing problems more
than that,
that's why l to leaving all those
things away l came near to you.
l have been told that l should give
speech to childrens,
lt's such a big word,
Forgive me, respected principle,
but l can't speak big things,
But l would like say one thing to
my little friends,
Childrens, your childhood are the
beautiful and finest days of
your life.
So, sitting there chunny will say,
that sahir l've lost my teeth and l
am feeling pain,
here bunty will say that teacher
punished me today,
some children would have a fear
of exams,
then these are not beautiful days.
Yes, l am believing you that
these are the most beautiful days,
because bunty when you will grow up,
and your shave will like this man,
Chuny, when you will become a pilot
and when you'll have tension to fly
a plane then you all will die for
these days,
But then these days and these moments
won't come back,
Today, your heart is true,
lt's noble,
lt's shining gold,
Today, what relations you will make
with your heart,
what friends you will make,
Friends like, Relations like,
will never make in life,
Today, to see you people,
l lost in my childhood,
You have nice clothes for wearing,
Good books for reading,
Nice food for eating,
and may be to see me here you people
don't beleive,
that in my childhood,
l didn't have it all,
My childhood was so decent and poor,
l wasn't filmstar sahir l was
just sahir,
My father was a poor man,
we had nothing,
but in everyone's childhood there is
someone,
who left his deep effect on our
little souls,
He became a partner of our mischiefs
and our troubles,
he became our friend,
he became our partner,
l had a partner in my childhood,
My support,
My God's light,
Billu!
Billu!
My friend,
l remember,
during the break in school,
childrens ate food from their tiffon,
l put my hand to tap
and l drunk just water,
then to touch my shoulder,
raising his tiffon to me,
Billu!
My friend,
My hair were long like girls,
but to cut them l didn't have a penny
in my pocket,
To get an advantage of his father's
absence on shop,
my hair cutter,
billu!
My friend,
When l was sad to missing my mom,
then stealing money from his
father's safe,
he took me for movies,
billu!
my friend,
When we returning our homes in
evening,
to gave me greed of peanuts,
he made me perody of film characters,
Those evenings,
in the journey of those streets,
Billu found out my inside actor,
l didn't believe on myself,
as much billu was believing on me,
One day.
to sold his gold earings,
he gave me mumbai ticket,
and kept the rest of money in my
pocket,
l hold his hand and asked him how
l'll return this money,
then he told you don't need to return
them,
Just any poor man,
and remember me,
that's enough,
then l came to mumbai,
To see this running life,
l became filmstar sahir khan from
sahir,
l went back to our village to find
my friend,
but he didn't meet me,
Someone told me that he felt in
love with some girl,
and she was not from his community,
Villagers were against him,
So saving his life
he ran away from the village,
l would like to tell you the truth,
Today l have everything,
Name, Fame,
Wherever l go, millions of people
came after me, calls my name,
Every place surrounds from my name,
But still today,
in those millions of voices,
l always search one voice,
You never told me anything,
You sold your earing,
that tiffon's matter,
but he remember everything,
Yes!
Even l didn't thought that he....
....will remember everything,
l can live my entire life with that
happiness,
that sahir still misses me,
l don't need anything from him,
His heart,
is very big.
and see where he reached,
what happen?
programme has finished,
then why did you came home,
We feel cry,
so we came home,
Forgive us father,
We made a big mistake,
lf l would be on your age then l
would said the same,
Whatever you said,
l heard everything,
l was wrong about you,
that you will become a big man,
so you will forget everything,
l forgot everything,
l searched you alot,
but you didn't meet my anywhere,
But you can find my address,
You never felt to meet me,
When l ran from village then l met
many problems,
Empty hands, responsibility,
new place,
to standing this house and business
much time has spend
And you rise very quick then....
l make plans but....
You are gone so far,
then l lost my hope,
to meet you,
My condition is very bad, and l don't
want you to see me in this condition,
Leave it,
lt was my self respect,
it was my shame,
Shame?
from me,
l felt,
Forgive me,
Bindiya!
Yes!
Come here,
What are your names?
Gunja and he is dugu,
Dugu?
My name is ronak,
very nice,
This is my first visit,
won't you offer me something,
l'll bring sweet for you,
Billu!
l have to go now,
but l will be back soon,
We will go to our village together,
and if possible you stay there,
that we should live our memories
again,
He is my uncle,
and others are neighbours,
Sir, l have write a poem,
l'm a friend of billu,
Just listen once,
l will be very greatful to you,
lt's nice,
l'll use it in my next film,
No, it's enough,
Now nobody offers me these kind of
songs,
