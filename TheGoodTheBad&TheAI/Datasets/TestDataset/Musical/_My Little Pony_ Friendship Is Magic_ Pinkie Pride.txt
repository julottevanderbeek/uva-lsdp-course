Thanks. I guess.

This party's going

I don't doubt it!
I don't know how
she does it!
Wow, look at her go!
Oh boy, this is
going to be good!
Oh boy, this is
going to be good!
Oh! I am so, so, so excited
because today I'm planning
the birthday bash of...
RAINBOW DASH!
Yeah!
Rainbow Dash.
Yes, Pinkie?
You realize that by enlisting
me as your party planner,
I guarantee that this is
going to be the funnest,
most fantabulous, superbial
party in Ponyville?
Uh, yeah? I guess.
No guesses.
Parties are no picnic.
Oh, I like a nice
picnic party.
Oh!
Parties are serious.
And you have my certified
"Pinkie Party Promise"
that you will have the
best birthday party ever!
OK!
Great!
Now, who's ready to join this
Super Duper Party Pony
to plan this super
duper par-tay?
Who are you, stranger?
Name's Cheese Sandwich.
I plan parties.
What an amazing coincidence!
I'm Pinkie Pie and
I'm planning a party!
Oh, it's no coincidence,
my little pony.
My Cheesy Sense was a-tingling,
tellin' me a party
was in the works.
A Cheesy Sense? Ah!
Double Amazing!
I have a Pinkie Sense!
Yes. I sensed you did.
And I happen to be the
premiere party planner
in all of Equestria.
Be it wing-ding, hoe-down,
hootenanny, or shindig,
I'm your pony!
A pair of Party Pony
Planners in Ponyville?
What could be more perfect?
I'll tell you what!
Making this party epic!
Cause this isn't
just ANY birthday.
It's also the anniversary of
when I moved to Ponyville!
Good heavens, Rainbow Dash!
It's your birth-aversary!
Exactly!
So what do you say,
party planners?
Oh, I think we
can do it!
Oh, I don't think so.
I know so.
After all...
The Super-duper-party-pony.
Me too!
C'mon ponies!
Who here likes
to party?
Ha ha! You do! I can tell!
Like me!
As if!
But when I threw a party
and I busted out some moves.
The ponies finally saw the
light and got into the groove!
You know it!
The super-duper-party-pony.
And me!
Uh, Pinkie?
Hey good lookin'!
Want some mayonnaise?
Geronimo!
The Super-duper-party-pony.
Come on, kid! Take
it for a spin!
Golly! Thanks, Mister!
and streamers in your mane.
Fizzy drinks, Hawaiian shirts
Come on everypony, let's
party down with Cheese!
You're really a
certified party Pony?
Yeah! Now that's what
I'm talking about!
I am so stoked you're
here, Cheese Sandwich.
Yeah, you sure did
come on the right day.
Your parties sound
simply divine.
We're so lucky to
have you here.
Just doin' my job,
little fillies.
but now this
party's gonna be...
...epic?
You said it!
No offense, Pinkie.
None taken.
My birth-aversary's
already lookin' way cooler!
You are my kind of party
pony, Cheese Sandwich!
You got that right,
Rainbow Dash!
All right, party ponies!
I've got some planning to do!
Aren't you going to help
Cheese Sandwich plan the party?
That's OK. Heh heh.
He obviously has what it
takes to do it all by himself.
Really?
Yes, indeedy!
After all, if Cheese really
is the super-duperest
partyingest pony of them all,
maybe that means...
I'm not.
Oh I remember this one:
my first party ever!
My whole family was there!
And that's Twilight's
Welcome to Ponyville party!
She didn't even expect
that one.
Oh, look at Gummy. He
just looks so excited
for his birthday party.
Mmmm...Shining Armour
and Cadence's wedding
sure was special...
Especially once
I got hold of the music!
I've got to get back out there
Have to show them that I tried
party-planning expertise,
Cheese Sandwich.
Well, they don't call
him the super-duper
Party Planner for nothin'!
That's it! This pony has got
to get her title back!
And I know just what to do!
Totally Awesome!
I can't believe it.
I challenge you...
to a GOOF-OFF!
Oh no!
Not a Goof-Off!
What's a Goof-Off?
I have no idea.
This Cheese has stood alone
a long time, Pinkie Pie.
You think you
can out-goof me?
Oh, I don't think so.
I KNOW SO!
And the stakes are
high, Cheese Sandwich.
Whoever wins will be dubbed the
ultimate Super Duper Party Pony
and headline the Rainbow
Dash Birth-Aversary Bash!
And the loser?
DOESN'T!
So, are you in, Cheese?
Or are you boneless?
Nopony calls me boneless!
Right Boneless?
Then the Goof-Off
is on for High Noon!
Um, Pinkie? It's already 3:00.
Oh, well then. Make
it 3:10 to Goof-Off!
All right, everypony!
According to my official
Goof-Off Rule Book...
She actually has a
Goof-Off Rule Book?
Are you kidding?
Twilight can find a rule
book for everything.
Shhh.
The two competitors have
free range to Goof About,
be it by singing, dancing,
playing, prancing, joking,
or performing to make the
Judge chortle, chuckle, giggle,
guffaw, hoot and holler,
whoop it up, and party down!
The funnier, sillier, wilder,
and goofier, the better.
Rainbow Dash, since the winner
will be headlining your party,
you are the Judge.
Henh. Big, tense competition
on my birth-aversary.
What could be better?
Cheese Sandwich? Pinkie
Pie? Are you ready?
I was born ready!
I was ready before I was born!
Then...let the goofing begin!
Call the doctor, beg and plead
"Doctor tell me what I need!"
Pretend you have no bones and
Hit it, Boneless!
Hit it, Gummy!
That's my song!
What do you mean?
I have no idea what
you're talking about!
That's it!
Like the ringing in your ear
Rainbow's not having
the best party ever.
I...I broke the "Pinkie
Party Promise."
STOP! The Goof-Off is off!
But I haven't named a winner.
You don't have to.
I forfeit.
Which means, Cheese
Sandwich wins!
Ha ha ha! ... I do?
Yes, you get to headline
Rainbow Dash's party.
But what about
you, Pinkie?
I...I don't!
Pinkie, wait!
I'm sorry I got all swept
away by Cheese Sandwich.
We all are.
Sorry, Pinkie.
No, I'm sorry I let my
pride get in the way
Cheese Sandwich really is a
Super Duper Party Planner
and he'll be a
terrific headliner.
I should have been a big
enough pony to admit that
and let you have your day.
But don't you get it?
You're both Super
Duper Party Ponies!
Sure, Cheese Sandwich is
a great guest party pony.
But you're Ponyville's
permanent party pony!
Nopony could ever
take your place
and we could never have
a party without you!
I never meant to take
your place in Ponyville.
I just wanted to show you what
a great party pony I am, Pinkie.
Why me?
Well...
Me?
Yes!
Really?
Ha! Really!
So I was the pony that threw the
awesomely spectacular party
that inspired you to become
an awesome spectacular
party thrower?
Swear on cammonbare!
Enough with the warm
fuzzy stuff, you two.
It's my birth-aversary and
you've gotta throw me a bash!
Yeah!
Let's go!
All right, everypony!
We are here to celebrate
the birthday...
And anniversary...
Hey, everypony!
Who's ready to get
their party on?
Hit it!
Get your hooves up the party's
Cheese Sandwich!
I gotta tell ya! You and Pinkie
have totally made this
the best birthday-anniversary
super combo ever!
It's totally...
...epic?
Yeah, it is!
That's all I needed
to hear, little filly.
Oh, he's not the only one.
Well, Boneless Two,
another job well done.
But it's time we mosey along.
Another town, another party.
I never did get
that pony's name.
All: CHEESE SANDWICH!
Oh yeah!
