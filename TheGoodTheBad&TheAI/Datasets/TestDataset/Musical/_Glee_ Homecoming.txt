BLAINE: In a world where
everything changes,
some things
always stay the same.
They say
there's only three things
When Kurt and I broke up,
I was devastated.
I thought I was gonna spend
the rest of my life with him,
My therapist told me
I should concentrate
And then...
I couldn't even do that.
But then I started
coaching the Warblers
Oh, yeah!
I needed to shake things up
even more.
Terrorist!
Hey.
It's me.
It's Blaine.
Look, bro, okay, I don't
care what your name is.
I'm not into that stuff.
BLAINE:
I realized that
I didn't need to change it up.
I had to get back
to where I once belonged,
that nothing's
ever gonna change.
Excuse me.
Can I help you?
You're Mr. Anderson, right?
Um, my name's Jane.
I am... new to Dalton.
Uh... what do you mean?
You're a girl.
My dad went to Dalton.
And two of my uncles.
That's nice.
But then here I was,
stuck at one of
the lowest-performing
public schools in Ohio,
with no arts, no music...
So my parents brought a Title IX
lawsuit against Dalton Academy
and won.
That's shocking.
I mean, that's-that's amazing.
Thanks, that's nice to hear.
Anyway, I talked to
the Dean of Performing Arts,
and he said I should
talk to you.
I want to be a Warbler.
Attention, McKinley idiots.
It's homecoming week,
which means that
a bunch of old farts
will be creeping
around the hallways
like
White Walkers...
Did you hear?
The glee club is back!
...horrifying me
with their beer bellies
and their liver spots.
And that's just
the class of 2012.
The sign-up sheet
is right over here.
SUE:
FYI,
the much-beloved McKinley High
homecoming dance
is canceled, due to...
uh, let's say Sharia Law.
Lima Loser.
I mean, honestly, I forgot
how cold those slushees are.
They chill you to the bone!
I'm so sorry that
happened, Rachel.
All right, guys,
dinner is served.
You know what, though?
It didn't really bother me.
It's like I felt good
being an underdog again,
like I was getting back
to my McKinley roots.
All that from getting
slusheed in the face?
Well, I guess Becky
did you a solid.
Well, I don't know.
Uh, wait, so you two
are co-directing, then?
Yes.
Not really.
Well, I guess we haven't come
around to that conversation yet.
We're just focusing on
recruiting right now, so...
Oh, uh...
Oh.
Oh, guess that's Blaine.
WILL:
Oh, hey, buddy.
Come on in.
BLAINE:
Hey, everybody.
Oh, my God, you will not believe
the day that I just had.
Sorry I'm late.
- What did I miss?
- WILL: Uh, not much,
but since I have you all here,
we might as well get started.
RACHEL: Mm-hmm.
We have some fierce show choir
competition ahead of us
and, uh, I think we should
lay down some ground rules.
Yes. Uh, like no stealing
each other's set lists
and no spying.
- And no poaching.
- Mm-hmm.
And always be supportive
and clap for each other,
no matter what.
I actually really,
really need everyone's advice.
I have a huge dilemma.
A girl wants
to join the Warblers.
What's the dilemma?
You cannot be on the wrong
side of history here.
I mean, you of all people
should know that.
Well, I know, I just think
that tradition
is important, too,
- you know?
- Yeah, well,
some traditions
are meant to be broken.
You have to let her try out.
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen?
A house divided against itself
cannot stand.
This house is built
on a foundation of lies.
The Warblers
is a house of lies!
Order!
BLAINE:
Look, look.
No decision has been made yet.
I'm just presenting the issue
for the Warbler
Council to discuss.
Should female students
be allowed to join?
You know, okay.
All right, what's next, huh?
Cat and dog Warblers?
I mean, the very question
is risible.
How about a student
who's a skunk?
Should it be allowed
to become a Warbler?
We can't have a girl Warbler.
Imagine the sexual tension.
We would never
get anything done.
But, uh, aren't
most of you guys gay?
How dare you?!
I have a girlfriend.
We all have girlfriends.
- Really?
- WARBLERS: Yes!
Order. Order.
Warblers, as coach,
I am a non-voting member
of this body,
and once a vote is cast,
I will respect
the council's decision.
But let's be on the right side
of history here.
Dr. King... he said that the arc
of the moral universe
bends toward justice, and...
isn't justice all about
equal rights
and equal opportunity
and inclusion?
I mean...
What about squirrels?
:
I mean,
should squirrels be allowed
to join the Warblers?
Th-The very premise
of your argument
is laughable.
WARBLER:
So is yours!
- Order!
- Order.
Thank you, gentlemen,
for that... high-minded debate.
As Head Warbler, I'd like
to propose a compromise.
Why take the unprecedented step
of amending
the Warbler constitution
when we may not even need to?
We may be allowed to refuse
entry based on gender.
And we may not.
That's an open question.
But what is not in question
is our right to refuse entry
based on talent.
What I'm saying is,
shouldn't we first find out
if she can even sing?
Hmm?
All those in favor?
:
Aye.
KURT: Well, I never agreed
to be your assistant.
I'm just saying, co-chair
seems a little more fair.
Yeah? Well, you never
would have thought
to do your work-study program
here at McKinley
if I wasn't here
in the first place.
Okay. Well, let just hold off
on the whole labels issue
until we actually have
a glee club to lead.
Fine.
Where did you put.
"We Both Reached for the Gun"
from
You organized them
chronologically?
Yes.
Wait a minute.
What does have
to do with Ace of Base?
I'm filing them
based on emotion,
as we always should
have filed them.
All right, this pile
is Divas Strike Back
and that pile is
Cherish Yourself
and that pile right
there is Makeovers,
'cause we always tend to
love a good makeover.
Great. Well, we just
wasted the past two hours,
and now we have to start over
all over again.
Okay, there is no point
in organizing sheet music
if we don't have any members.
Rachel, you've got
to get more proactive
if you expect this to work.
All right, you can't just
post a sign-up sheet
and-and expect people
to sign up, like Mr. Shue did.
McKinley has changed.
Sue has got these kids thinking
the arts don't even exist.
We have got to show them
that Glee is possible.
I'll be in the auditorium.
MALE VOICE:  Can you hear me
now, can you hear me now?
I'm singing out...
I promise I am not looking
at anyone or anything,
I just am looking...
Don't worry. Sorry, guys.
And...
Oh...
Can you hear me now,
can you hear me now?
I'm singing out...
Oh, my God, Sam,
you hear it, too?
Yeah, is it like
a high-pitched ringing
but only in your left ear?
Because yes, I do, all the time.
I never wanted
Mr. Shue to know
because he's like God to me,
but now that you know,
I feel like I can tell you
all this stuff that I've
been holding... Shh!
I hear it now.
I swear I heard it.
I know it's true.
Yeah.
No, I believe you, Rachel.
I mean... doctors won't,
but I believe you.
Found the God mic.
Hmm.
Okay...
I know things got
a little crazy earlier,
and we both said some things
about your life
that weren't very nice, so...
Mostly me.
Wait, why are you smiling?
'Cause you were right.
A-About me hiding in here
and not being proactive.
But when you left yesterday,
I had an epiphany
and I heard a voice.
You-you found a student?
Not exactly, but I heard him.
At least I think it's a him.
Well, let's not label or judge.
The point is,
is that you were right.
About everything.
They're out there.
They're here, right now,
in McKinley,
hiding in plain sight.
They just need something huge
to draw them out,
to show them what they could be.
Uh-huh.
So I got on the phone.
With who?
With everyone!
MERCEDES:
Surprise!
Yay!
Let's go say hi.
ARTIE:
What's up?
RACHEL:
Hi, guys!
Pull up, pull up.
Artie!
Hi...
BRITTANY:
I missed you!
- PUCK: Hey, buddy.
- QUINN: Hey.
Hi!
Missed your musk.
ARTIE:
Hi.
Oh, my God.
SAM:
Hey.
Now the whole gang is back
to reboot the glee club.
Damn it, you guys,
you said you'd wait for me
- to park the rental car!
- ALL: Oh...
ALL:
Tina! Tina!
Come on!
Come over here,
let's go.
ALL :
Tina, Tina, Tina,
- Tina, Tina, Tina...
- SAM: Come on, Tina!
...Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina...
Yay, group hug!
Are you still a virgin?
Sam...
Hugs, everybody!
It's so great to have
you all together
in this room again.
It means so much to us
that you would come
at the drop of a hat.
Artie, are you drawing me?
- Nope, just your boobs.
- Hmm.
I'm practicing for my
storyboarding class.
Okay, we need to focus.
Yeah, guys, we really got
to focus here, okay?
We-We're in crisis mode,
all right?
Glee Club has done so
much for all of us.
You know? It brought
us together,
it-it gave us hope, it
put us out in the world.
And it brought
some of us home again.
She's talking about me.
Here's the situation.
We need you guys back...
Not all the time,
we realize that you have lives
in other places.
We've got to get Glee Club
back on its feet, you know?
Especially since now some
of us are the competition.
He's talking about
Shue and Blaine.
We need you back.
Not all the time,
but if you're not here,
then the tradition of the club
we love so much will be gone.
So we're going to find kids
that can bring something to it
the same way that we did,
and we will mentor them
based on our strengths.
KURT: But right
now we really got
to get out there
and take on the school.
You know, really
rattle Sue's cage.
We are going to give McKinley
a little taste of what
they've been missing.
Talking away
I don't know
what I'm to say, I'll
Say it anyway
Today isn't my day
to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming
for your love, okay?
Take on me...
Take me on...
I'll be gone
In a day or two...
Oh, things that you say
Is it life or just
to play my worries away?
You're all the things
I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming
for you anyway
Take on me...
Take me on...
I'll be gone
In a day...
Take me on...
Oh, take me on
I'll be gone
In a day...
BOY:
about the fat kid
who always wears headphones?
He wears them
so he doesn't have to hear
'Cause, believe me,
I've heard them all.
It's supposed to be
the best year of my life,
but instead I'm a no-name
transfer from Chicago,
and not one of these
McKinley douche bags
I've got my boys: Tupac,
Hendrix, Jagger, Sinatra.
but it's the only friend
that I need.
wouldn't kill me
to meet some people here.
I'm sorry, what?
Are you thinking of trying out
for the glee club?
- I-I just saw the...
- Fantastic.
I'm Rachel Berry,
and I'm rebooting McKinley's
award-winning New Directions!
With my best friend Kurt Hummel.
You may have heard of us.
We're taking a break from
our showbiz careers right now
just to give back
to the community.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't even ask your name.
- Uh, Roderick.
- Okay, Roderick,
so auditions are next week,
and we're asking everyone
to prepare an up-tempo song
and a ballad.
Do you have any favorites?
- I...
- Fantastic.
Okay, so I would pick
something not too obscure...
Like "Corner of the Sky"
from
Isn't that, like,
the best song ever?
And then I would pick
something not too popular.
Try not to stay within,
like, two minutes.
And if I were you, I would do,
like, 16 to 32 bars.
- Here's some sheet music for...
- Uh, listen, I... I'm sorry.
I-I-I'm really busy
after school
with everything, so...
- Okay, are you sure?
- Thank you.
It was nice meeting you.
Nice going, Berry.
You scared him off.
Jane, wait up. Wait.
The Warbler Council has decided
to let you come in
and sing for them.
They want to see
how talented you are
before they decide to overturn
a 100-year-old
males-only policy.
Let me get this straight.
I have to go in there
and perform for the Warblers
just to make sure
I'm good enough
to warrant them
taking a closer look
at their already sexist
and discriminatory
admission policies?
Yeah.
Hey, Jane, Jane, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just-just listen to me.
Look, the Warblers are
a very old organization.
I mean, they've been around
since the War of 1812.
When Francis Scott Key sang
"The Star-Spangled Banner"
to an ailing
President William Henry Harrison
on his death bed,
the Warblers sung behind him.
The point
that I'm trying to make
is that sometimes change
is scary,
even when it doesn't seem
all that significant,
and I'm telling you,
it would mean so much to me...
And-and it could mean
so much to the Warblers...
If you'd just...
if you could swallow your pride,
come in and show us
what you got.
And before you do,
there is someone
I want you to meet.
Jane, meet Rachel Berry,
the greatest performer
I have ever known.
Ms. Berry, it's so nice
to actually meet you.
You're a legend.
Yeah, well, that's not
the general opinion these days,
but thank you...
It's an honor to help.
I think you are in the
best possible hands.
My work is done here,
and I think I should leave
you two ladies alone.
All right.
Um... can I say something?
Why are you helping me?
Oh, well, look.
We might be mortal
show-choir enemies,
but I'm a woman
before all of that,
and I figure you're fighting
this fight for all of us girls,
so... let's get started.
Okay.
Center stage.
All right.
It's a packed house.
Show me your presence.
Okay, keep your back straight.
You have to command the audience
with your body language.
Keep your head up.
And make eye contact.
Even if there's
a hundred people out there,
you have to make
a personal connection.
You have to
make each person feel
like they have a one-on-one
connection with you.
And, most important,
your song.
Well, my family has a tradition
of singing "Up, Up and Away,"
which is bad because...
Let me see your phone.
Oh, it... well...
Janelle Monáe's "Tightrope"
has the most plays.
Oh, my God, that...
she's incredible.
Well, I think you found
your audition song.
Oh.
Okay.
From the top.
KURT:
Hey. I'm open.
I guess that's
why I was the kicker.
Which was a
transformational moment
for the school, by the way.
Yeah, marked the beginning
of a great synchronicity
between Glee Club and football.
Just ask any of the...
the football guys
that are back for homecoming.
So, why aren't they here
trying to recruit me?
Why'd they send you?
'Cause we both like guys?
Look, I know we don't have
much else in common,
but only a gay man
knows what it's like
for us out there.
I know, when you were
in high school,
being gay was how you
primarily identified yourself,
but that's not my thing.
But don't you think it's
everyone else's thing?
When I told people I was gay,
only two people
had a problem with it.
Coach Beiste
kicked them off the team.
Look, you're... you're naive
if you don't think
you're standing
on our shoulders.
Okay, you owe Glee Club.
Please. I owe
Listen, when Coach Beiste
kicked those guys off the team,
they cornered me
in the parking lot
when I was getting into my car.
Got all up in my face.
One of them ended the day
with his jaw wired shut,
and the other... I don't think
he ever stopped running.
I can't stand Gaga,
I've never seen
and I don't write
fan fiction
where Archie and Jughead
are hot for each other.
Just because you and I
happened to be born in the same
ten percent of the population
that would choose
Andrew Garfield over Emma Stone,
doesn't mean we have
anything else in common.
So, I'm not saying no
to your glee club
because it's gay or straight;
I'm saying no
because I think it sucks.
I'm sorry, man.
Ready?
Distinguished councilmen,
fellow Warblers,
may I present...
Jane Heyward.
Oh...
Some people talk about you
Like they know all about you
When you get down,
they doubt you
And when you're tippin'
on the scene
Yeah, they talkin' 'bout it
'Cause they can't tip
on the scene
What you talkin' 'bout it,
t-t-t-talkin' 'bout it
When you get elevated
They love it or they hate it
You dance up on them haters
Keep getting funky
on the scene
While they jumpin' round you
They're trying to take
all your dreams
But you can't allow it
'Cause, baby, whether
you're high or low
Whether you're high or low
You got to tip on the
tightrope
Now let me see you do the
tightrope
And I'm still tippin' on it
I tip on alligators
and little rattlesnakers
But I'm another flavor,
something like a Terminator
Ain't no equivocating
I fight for what I believe
Why you talkin' about it?
N-N-Now whether
I'm high or low
Whether I'm high or low
I got
to tip on the tightrope
Now,
baby, tip on the tightrope
You can't get too high
I said you can't get too low
One, two, three, ha!
Yeah
Yeah
Baby, whether
I'm high or low
Baby,
whether you're high or low
You got to tip
on the tightrope
Yeah, tip on the tightrope
Baby, baby,
whether you're high or low
Baby,
whether you're high or low
You got to tip on the
tightrope
Baby, let me
see you tightrope
Right here
Oh... oh...
Oh...
Oh, you
Got to stay on the scene
Yeah
Tightrope
Oh, yeah, yeah, ooh.
The Tea Party Patriot Club
has now come to order.
First order of business...
Protecting McKinley's borders.
PUCK:
Attention!
At ease, teabaggers.
I'm Airman First Class
Noah Puckerman.
But you can call me sir.
QUINN:
When we went to McKinley,
we were part
of conservative clubs as well,
such as the Celibacy Club
and the God Squad.
Most of you guys are
Christians, right?
We're all Christian.
Before I joined Glee Club,
I only hung out with people
that were exactly like me.
And then Puck got her pregnant,
and she sort of changed
for the better.
The point is, nerds...
You need to take
the three-cornered hats
out of your loser butts
and join the New Directions!
They'll take anybody. Even you.
Sir, I was brought up
to respect my elders.
But don't call us losers.
The Tea Party Patriots is
McKinley's most popular club.
Oh, my God, that's horrible.
What is happening to America?!
I'll tell you what's happened.
We've grown up in the
biggest economic depression
since the 1930s.
Our mission is to fix the mess
that Barack Hussein Obama
created
before he and the homo-elite
turn this country
into a Muslim welfare state.
Oh, no.
Oh, hell to the no.
You know what?
Don't you, you or you join
the glee club.
'Cause, you know, we don't need
you ignorant, backwards,
lily-white, gay-hating,
Obama-bashing clubbers anyway.
Nope.
I will be taking these.
Yeah.
And you know what?
Quinn once had sex
with a Latina lesbian.
Ooh.
Learned that in Glee Club.
M-My bad.
Order.
Order!
Order.
The Warbler Council
voted against you.
They saw how talented you are,
but they're a brotherhood, and
they voted to keep it that way.
What am I gonna tell my dad?
You are gonna tell him
that we are not giving up on you
because I am going straight
to the Dalton board of directors
and telling them
that I am not interested
in coaching the Warblers
if you're not one of them.
So you're going
to threaten to resign
so I can join a club
where nobody wants me?
Yeah.
Yeah, because this is wrong.
This is wrong.
And sometimes, if you
want to make change,
you-you got to make
a little noise.
I can fix this.
I just need a little time.
QUINN: Okay, just remember...
Sex sells.
BRITTANY: That's true,
that's how Lady Tubbington got.
Lord Tubbington caught up
in a Ponzi scheme.
I got one more problem
with you, girl
Hey
Hey, baby,
even though I hate ya
I wanna love ya
And even though
I can't forgive ya
I really wanna
Tell me, tell me, baby
Why can't you leave me?
'Cause even though
I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it
Head in the clouds
Got no weight
on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got
ARTIE:
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem
without ya
I got
one less problem without ya
I got one less,
one less problem
I know you're never
gonna wake up
I better give up
I know I shouldn't
ever call back
Or let you come back
Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit
breathless
I shouldn't want it
Head in the clouds
Got no weight
on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got...
Smart money betting
I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be
forgetting all about you
You saying that you know,
but I really, really doubt you
Understand my life is easy
when I ain't around you
Half-stepping, either you
want it or you just playing
I'm listenin' to you knowin'
I can't believe whatcha sayin'
There's a million yous,
baby boy, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems,
but you won't be one
Like what...
Oh...
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulder
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got...
One less problem without ya
Hey
I've got one
less problem without ya
Oh, babe
I've got one
less problem without ya
Ooh
I got one less,
one less problem
Ooh...
I've got one
less problem without ya
Yeah, yeah.  I've got one
less problem without ya
I've got one less,
one less, yeah
Problem, yeah.
You guys got some great moves.
We could really use some
of that in the glee club.
Yeah, you could.
Oh, hi, Artie.
Kitty, wh-where have you been?
I thought Sue made
all the New Directions! Transfer
out of McKinley.
We need you back.
You really think
I'm gonna come back
and help you
and your stupid glee club
after the way
you treated all of us?
The way you treated me
when you went away to college?
Sue didn't make me transfer
because she's smart enough
to recognize
a star player when she sees one.
Unlike Rachel Berry who never
even knew any of our names.
I know your
name, it's Quinn.
I'm Quinn.
Liar.
Listen, don't you guys
want to do more
than just get shot
out of cannons?
Don't you want to be a star?
Oh, that is rich
coming from you.
Pathetically stuffed back into
your Cheerios! Uniforms again.
BOTH:
Can two people try out together?
Yes. Yep. Yeah, I
don't see why not.
The three of us
tried out together.
Of course
the incest twins want in.
Let's go, ladies.
We have to explain
to these two again
why is
not a love story to aspire to.
If you really
want to get Blaine back,
here's what you do.
First, promise him you're
gonna burn all your clothing
and then tell him
you're gonna start dressing
like a normal person.
Then I think you should really
start getting honest with him
about following
your life's ambition,
which is becoming America's
top Barbara Bush impersonator.
That's not my life's ambition.
:
That's hilarious.
RACHEL:
Okay, guys... progress report.
How's it going with
the new recruits?
Horrible.
It ain't working.
MERCEDES:
It's not good, Rachel.
Glee Club has fallen
so far at this school,
we're not gonna be able
to get anyone to join.
MAN :
I'm singing out...
RACHEL:
There's the voice again.
Oh...
Dudes, he's in the showers
in the locker room.
They're always in the showers.
ALL:
Shh!
Oh...
Can you hear me now,
can you hear me now?
I'm singing out...
O-Oh... oh...
Oh, God.
Are you guys gonna beat me up?
'Cause I just need a second
to get in the fetal position...
No, no, we...
we heard you singing.
Yeah, you're amazing.
Dude, you've got to audition
for the glee club.
So people can make fun of me
more than they already do?
Even the principal calls me
"White Precious."
Come here, you are precious.
Well, all anybody cares about in
Glee Club is the way you sing.
Look, no one has signed up
for your club yet, right?
Okay. Well, having me
as your first member
is just gonna drive kids
away even more.
I have designed my entire life
around people not noticing me.
Look, no one has wanted
to feel more invisible
than I have over the past
couple of months.
But when I'm with these people,
they remind me
of the best parts of myself.
And they would never
make fun of me.
Mmm, not to her face, no way.
You're the poster child
for Glee Club.
You're why Mr. Shue started
the club in the first place.
I-It's a place
where misfits can fit in.
Will you please try out?
I'm really sorry
that I came on so strong.
But you can sing
whatever you want.
Yeah, I guarantee
you're gonna get in.
QUINN:
Look at all of us.
We're all so different,
and yet there's nothing
that we wouldn't
do for each other.
We're all just
a phone call away.
And that is because we
took a chance on Glee Club.
And that's something
that you deserve as well.
SUE:
I had finally killed
my white whale,
vanquished the tone-deaf
pansexual Leviathan
that is the McKinley High
Glee Club,
to defile the great musical
heritage of this nation
that my Pakistani doctor
has informed me
that I, Sue Sylvester, have
developed a duodenal ulcer.
Ah...
And now I've taken
to drinking a mixture
of motor oil, Bloody Mary mix
and bat guano,
There must be some way
I can get at that glee club,
some naive unsuspecting pawn
I can bend to my will
to dismantle that glee club
once and for all.
Oh, Journal, once again, you've
given me reason to go on.
Sue Sylvester knows who her
shiny new plaything will be.
So let me get
this straight, Sue.
Uh, Principal Sylvester.
You want me to infiltrate
the glee club
and be terrible on purpose
so that everybody gets
demoralized and quits.
It works every time.
And I'll make it
worth your while.
What's that?
This is a
one-of-a-kind,
custom-molded Tom
Brady Fleshlight.
Um, no, thank you.
Okay, well...
How about I hook up with
my friends at Pfizer
to supply me with
enough anti-nausea pills
so I can stomach a conversation
with the lovably
hideous Coach Beiste
and force her to make you
the starting quarterback.
I'm gonna have to be really
honest with you, Sue.
It's, uh, Principal Sylvester.
First of all, I'm not for sale.
And secondly, if you want
to get rid of the glee club,
you're gonna have to get
better items than that.
Touché, postmodern gay.
Hey, uh, can you, can you
take your headphones off?
It's distracting me.
Uh, actually, I kind of need...
No, it's fine.
It's okay.
You can keep them on.
We get it.
Everyone has
their own security blanket.
We just want to hear you sing.
Mustang Sally
Uh
Huh
Guess you better slow
your Mustang down
Oh, Lord
What I said now
Uh
Mustang Sally, now, baby
Oh, Lord
Guess you better slow
your Mustang down
Uh
Oh, yeah
You've been runnin'
all over the town now
Oh, I guess
you'll have to put
Your flat feet on the ground
Uh
What I said now
Listen, all you want to do
Is ride around, Sally
All you want to do
is ride around, Sally
All you want to do
is ride around, Sally
All you want to do
is ride around, Sally
Listen
One of these early mornings
I'm gonna be wiping
your weeping eyes
What I said
Oh, Lord
What I said now
Oh
Yeah!
Oh, wait.
Thank you.
Uh, we'll be posting names
this week,
but that was
really amazing, Roderick.
Thank you.
Why don't we just let him in?
Okay, you're in!
Thank you.
Loyal subjects,
Homecoming Day is upon us,
and I am pleased
to welcome back one
of McKinley High's
most distinguished graduates,
who will serve as Grand Marshal
for tonight's activities.
Becky Jackson,
I hand it over to you.
Becky.
Listen up, bitches.
Tonight Becky Jackson's
in charge.
Rule number one,
I'm bringing my Taser.
I am going to drop anyone who
is not dressed in school colors.
Rule number two,
no making out
under the bleachers.
That's where I'm gonna make out.
Rule number three,
every student must bring
two books to burn
at the bonfire.
Rule number four...
Okay, that's enough. Give me the
microphone. Give me the microphone.
BECKY: The losing team
will be sacrificed.
SUE:
Okay, that's enough.
Let go of the microphone.
Honey, I'm gonna peel
your fingers off one by one.
Give me the microphone!
Give it to me!
Oh, there she is.
Come on. You don't want
to be late
for the first official
glee club meeting.
You okay?
Yeah, I was just...
thinking about Mr. Shue.
About how he did it.
About how he turned nothing
into what we became.
As individuals and as
a team and as friends.
Well, we can't recreate
what we had,
but we have to be open
to finding something new
or different or better.
Yes.
So, why don't we just have
the meeting in here?
I mean, since I am
the only member?
First of all, we have
to have the first meeting
in the choir room.
It's tradition.
And second of all,
you're not the only member.
Someone new joined yesterday.
Wait, who?
I cannot believe you did this!
We sat down, we made rules.
No poaching.
It's not poaching.
She came to me.
I don't feel comfortable
with this.
Even if they let me
on the Warblers,
I'll be fighting
for every vocal breakout.
Yeah, you'll be fighting
that fight anywhere.
Yeah, but at least here,
it'll be a fair fight.
With the changes
Principal Sylvester
has made to the school,
it's academically on par
with any private school
in the state.
My parents are willing
to let me transfer here
if it's what I want.
And besides, what did you
expect me to do?
I mean, say no?
Jane asked me
not to say anything
until the transfer papers
were through.
I just spent the last two days
threatening to quit my job
in order to convince everyone
to let her in,
and as soon as I did,
she tells me she's leaving
to join your team?
I was humiliated.
Blaine, you have a full team
and God knows how many
other students at Dalton
that would kill to join.
Don't act all cool
and loving about this, Kurt.
I'm sure you're very happy
about all of this.
I wouldn't be surprised
if you made this all happen
after seeing you with Dave.
Uh, maybe I should just go.
- No, it's okay. No, stay.
- No, no, stay.
You're fine. You should stay
and see what kind of people
your coaches are.
This whole
friendly competition thing...
it's over.
The new and improved glee club
has officially begun.
Introducing our first
two members,
Jane and Roderick.
:
If you build it, they will come.
Well, they'd better come fast.
I mean, I'm sorry,
but two people?
SANTANA:
Shut up, Tina.
There's actually four.
As per usual, my undeniable
sexual magnetism
has worked yet again.
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Mason and Madison
McCarthy.
Hey, gang.
We're super pumped
there's a glee club again.
Now, I know what
you're thinking.
They can obviously log roll
and kick toss,
but can they sing?
Well, not to toot our own horns...
Toot!
But we've won karaoke night
at the Wapakoneta
Summer Cheer Camp
every year since we were three.
It's in our blood.
Our parents met while touring
with the inspirational,
world-famous singing group,
Up with People.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I think I've made a mistake.
RACHEL: No, it's okay.
You're welcome.
I mean, you're gonna have
to audition.
We have a very rigorous process.
I mean, not really. Sugar Motta
was literally tone-deaf.
Yeah, but she was hot.
I'm actually really happy.
This is the start
of something really special.
And I know that most of you
came home just for homecoming
and not for me and Kurt,
but we can't tell you how
grateful we are for your help.
- Get over here.
- Let's hug.
- Bring it in.
- Get in for this.
You guys, bring it in!
Start getting comfortable
with group hugs.
Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my ma and pa
Not the way that
I do love you
Well, holy moley, me, oh, my
You're the apple of my eye
Girl, I've never loved
one like you
Man, oh, man,

Try having sex
with Michael Bolton
and not fall in love.
That's hard!
La, la, la, la
Take me home
Daddy, I'm coming home
Mama, I'm coming home
I'll follow you
into the park
Through the jungle,
through the dark
Girl, I never loved
one like you
Moats and boats
and waterfalls
Alleyways
and pay phone calls
I've been everywhere
with you
Hey
That's true
We laugh
until we think we'll die
Barefoot on a summer night
Never could be sweeter
than with you
And in the streets
we're runnin' free
Like it's only you and me
Geez, you're something
to see
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever
I'm with you
Ah, home
Let me come ho-oh-ome
Home is when
I'm alone with you
Alabama
Arkansas
I do love my ma and pa
Moats and boats
and waterfalls
Home is when
I'm alone with you.
