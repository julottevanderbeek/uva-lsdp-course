So what's your sun-sign?
Listen l'm already engaged..

Typical lndian mentality.

And l'm Alvira.. Alvira
Khan from Lahore..
Not typical lndian mentality..
Thank God!
Napkin?
Take it..
My best friend also Pakistani.
Huffy Bhai.. Hafeez Pathan,
business partner..
He brings the latest lndian
movies from Pakistan..
l make copies of the DVDs
and market them..
Marketing pirated DVDs.. Wow.
As if you've never watched
a pirated movie.
l don't watch lndian movies.
Whatchyasaying?
lt's true.
So you watch Pakistani movies?
They're crap.
l only watch foreign language films..
..French, Chinese, lranian..
At times Hollywood.
At times Hollywood!
And that's good. Which is why l'm not
even in the DVD business anymore..
Now Huffy Bhai and l are
Property Agents..
My folks.. they love lndian movies..
Papa wanted to name me Madhubala,
Mama got stuck on Sadhna.
Alvira is very beautiful name.
Flirting again..
Why should l.. l'm engaged
too. See original Topaz.
l've come to pick up my fiance too..
..she's coming by the
same train as your fiance..
Does she even have a name or
you always call her fiance?
No she's nameless.. what a question!
So what's her name?
Anaida..
So how did you two meet up?
First time, we met at the Hotel Ritz.
Ritz?
The one in Paris..
The same one where the Princess
Diana-Dodi episode happened..
l was there that night.. Diana
was looking amazing..
l was just five feet away.. Had l
reached out l could've touched her..
And then appeared Anaida.. Hundred
times more beautifuler than Diana..
She was the Assistant
Manager at the Ritz..
As Diana and Dodi reached the gate..
..suddenly photographers popped
out of everywhere..
Everybody was looking at Diana..
..but l was looking at Anaida
Diana-Dodi's story was
coming to an end..
..and Rikki-Anaida's love
story was about to start
Haven't you heard..
When two love-birds die
another two are born.
You were wearing a suit?
Yeah..
You see..
God made Man..
.. And Tailor made Gentleman.
God made Man and after that
Tailor made Gentleman.
..Huffy Bhai says.
Can't imagine you in a suit.
Goodness..
Such a historic moment and you're
worried about my suit..
Had you and Huffy Bhai gone to
rent out the Eiffel Tower?
We're also into antiques in a big
way.. We'd gone to Paris for a deal.
DVDs, property, antiques.. Wow.
Just not fashionable doing one
business these days, boss.
Huffy Bhai was bringing the seller
and the antiques from Bombay..
..and l was handling
the buyers in Paris.
And these antiques were
obviously stolen.
They would have rotted
away in lndia anyway..
..what's the harm if a few people
make some money out of it?
lt's 100%y hard earned money, madam.
Yeah right!
Want to hear the rest of the
story or should l leave?
After finishing the story.
We'd been waiting for more
than three hours..
l was getting desperate..
when would Huffy Bhai come..
..when would this deal get over..
..and when would l celebrate
with Anaida..
Hello..
Rikki my darling!
Huffy Bhai..
Where are you man?
Got stuck in Bombay..
Whatchyasaying!
l'll get screwed..
Cops snatched the goods darling..
What about you?
Slipped out the moment l smelt
trouble.. Have the buyers left?
Nope.. they're all here..
Better slip out Rikki, slipping
in and out is what we do best.
And look, just handle them with care.
They're babbling something in French.
l think they're cursing..
Hello.. Monsieur, don't go..
Hello.. hello..
- Hello.. - Excuse me sir..
Your bill..
..please.
Huffy Bhai he's asking
for my signature..
He's climbing onto me Huffy Bhai.
One minute please..l
ine cut.. l don't..
- Huffy Bhai. - Signature..
You were staying at The
Ritz with empty pockets?
The antique seller coming from lndia
was to finance the trip..
l didn't even have enough cash
to watch cabaret at Lido..
Where was Anaida in all this?
Coming to that, boss..
First let me get out of the room..
Couldn't have walked out with the
suitcase, they'd have caught me..
..so l stuffed everything
in my pockets..
..wore my clothes on top of
each other and walked out.
l'm Slim Shady, my Mamma's Slim Shady,
please stand up, please stand up..
She was just two feet away..
..she looked at me and said..
Are you alright sir?
l died!
She was being so nice to me and
l was sneaking out of the hotel!
Check air-conditioning..
Any call tell l back evening ok..
Ok.
Keys..
Signature sir!
Excuse me..
Credit Card payment.. non..
Why?
Last bill.. when did you pay?
Just paid before coming.
Credit card company says you haven't
paid your dues for a year.
Liars!
Never go for this card..
l'm really regretting.
Careful with that please..
it's invaluable.
Lottery ticket..
First prize one million pounds..
second prize free trip to Hollywood.
At this moment you're holding
a million bucks in your hand.
Monsieur Thukral, l'm sure you will
win the lottery some day..
..you'll become a millionaire
some day..
..but the bill you'll
settle today. Now!
Anaida Madam..
Now look..
Just by living in France you
don't become French..
..you got lndian blood
in those veins.
Mon pere et mere etre Karachi.
Blood is Pakistani, Monsieur
Thukral, not lndian.
Pakistani!
l was screwed.. she was going to
kill me with 60 years of hatred.
You lndians are amada to fight
but always blame Pakistanis.
Amada means..?
Don't you know what amada means?
Sorry l don't.
lt means ready.. always
ready to fight.
l'm just amada to tell
you my love story.
Am l fighting with you?
Why would you fight with me?
l'm not even Pakistani.
l'm British you know..
Oh you're British.. They what's the
quarrel.. Long live the Queen..
So where was l?
..there was Anaida, in her chair,
and here l was standing beside her..
What are these two going on about?
That l call the cops.
No no no need cops. Just think..
..if this episode hadn't happened..
if we'd met like normal people, the
situation would've been very different.
Together we would've gone
to Eiffel Tower..
..climbed to the
top and screamed..
l love you Rikki! l love you Anaida!
l said watch it!
Ok.. ok.
Tell me what l have to do..
l will do it..
Till the entire bill is
squared, l'm yours..
..even otherwise l'm yours..
Just follow me..
These stay with me.
Can l take off my clothes?
l'll drown in my sweat.. please..
Where's the bathroom?
Solomon..
Rikki..
What a cruel woman this Anaida!
Hey..
..you're talking about my fiance!
Sorry..
After washing how many
plates did she melt?
What is my name?
Rikki Thukral.
Righto!
Ullu ka pattha..
Paththa..
Never mind.. try this..
Harami!
Harami..
Well done! Harami means..
my dear.. Anaida where?
Say it in Hindi..
Why cry?
Madam..
What do you want?
Me? Nothing..
Hanky you want.
Just leave me alone..
Take take..
My best friend also Pakistani..
No.. l have these..
This special hanky..
Makes beautiful face more beautifuler.
See.. tears going..
..smile coming.. more beautifuler.
Merci..
But why cry?
lt's Diana's funeral..
Today?
Where? London?
l so badly wanted to go.
So don't feel sad..
Let's both go to London..
l couldn't get leave.
That's so unfair..
No leave even for such
an important thing..
They really overwork you.
Look, but when you come to London
next stay at my house..
lt's small.. but very nice.
No..
Actually, it's too small for you..
Thukral..
Want to go home?
lf l let you go my boss will fire me.
Believe me, Anaida madam..
Moment you let me go l'll be back
from London in a jiffy with the money.
But if you don't.. l will be screwed.
l will not allow anybody screw you..
One chance, please.
Soon as l landed in London, l went
straight to Diana memorial..
To offer flowers..
You went to offer flowers?
l'd never waste money
on dead people..
l would think so.
Huffy Bhai is a die-hard
Diana lover..
.. even now if you mention her name,
he gets a sigh attack..
My instrument is broken, here l am,
a musician without fame..
My beloved is gone, here l am,
living without shame..
l'm in a mess Huffy Bhai.. - What?
Have to go back to Paris to settle
the hotel bill.. gimme some money.
Have you gone mad?
Have we ever settled anything
that we'll settle a bill?
No..
But this time we will..
please gimme some money.
lf Huffy Bhai says no, then
it's a no. End of story.
Now forget about it dear..
see what l have here..
l've been through hell and you're
showing me this photo.
Not just any photo.. look behind it.
We'll go dancing to Hollywood my
boy.. you won the lottery Rikki!
You won the lottery! Your Hollywood
dream has come true!
We're going to Hollywood my boy,
we're going to Hollywood!
Why are you stumped?
- Lost it.. - Not lost..
it's with Anaida.
- Who's that? - Hotel's manager..
What does she look like?
- Very beautiful.
- Not another word l understood
everything. - Understood what?!
Had to leave the suitcase
and wallet with her..
She wasn't letting me leave..
the ticket's in the wallet.
How many times have l told you,
stay away from women..
..they snatch things that matter.
- Now go back and get
the ticket. - How?
Without the money for the bill..
she'll get me arrested..
Here..
What all you make me do..
Huffy Bhai must you lift
your shirt everywhere..
lf l move l'll lose my place.
Here. And don't tell that
girl you won. Understood?
Now get lost..
l'll get you perfume from Paris.
Yea, l'll have a real perfume
party. Now scram!
l dreamt of going to Hollywood..
..but the lottery ticket was
financed by Huffy Bhai.
My heart was dying to live the
Hollywood dream with Anaida.
But l made my heart understand..
She's Miss World, you're Rikki Thukral
Why would she go with you? Huffy
Bhai is what you get Rikki..
Settle the bill get
the ticket.. simple.
Hullu ke paththa!
What's baldy saying?
He says, can't believe you're back.
l had to.. My lottery
ticket's still with you.
You came for the ticket?
And to settle the bill..
..it's all there.. including
the taxi-fares.
Good..
Solomon..
And my stuff?
Solomon.. his stuff.
Harami why is she so touchy today?
Why angry?
My ticket!
Madam..
What do you want?
That..
What that?
That which is in your hand..
that's mine too.
lt's in my hand.. so it's mine.
Whatchyasaying?
lt was in my purse.. which
l left with you..
- With whose permission
did you go? - Yours..
And if l hadn't let you go?
l'd have rotted away..
or gone to jail.
And that didn't happen.
So?
So this ticket is.. My fee..
Fees?
For saving you.. How
do you say.. My cut.
Au'revoir..
My God! What a creep..
l know..
So then how did you get engaged?
That's another story altogether..
lf my eyes were a crystal palace blue
Walk right in, wouldn't you?
Just for one day if not two
What's life without you
Dunked in dew, a peppermint drop,
you waft so cool and fresh
A thread cut kite soaring away,
a sliced cloud caress
Give me all the pieces or
a fragment of your heart
Or else give me back my
Ticket to Hollywood
Ticket to Hollywood,
Ticket to Hollywood
Give it back!
Ticket to Hollywood,
Ticket to Hollywood
Give it back!
Ticket to Hollywood,
Ticket to Hollywood
Give it back!
Ticket to Hollywood, Ticket
to Hollywood Give it back!
Dunked in dew, a peppermint drop,
you waft so cool and fresh
A thread cut kite soaring away,
a sliced cloud caress
Two inches off the ground you
walk, stepping on thin air
Leave a hint, a footprint,
and l'll stop and stare
At the corner of that sidewalk,
that's closest to your lair
Say the word and l'll wait
my life right there
No, no monsieur, no, no,
lt ain't that simple now
Go get lost somehow
This is all you'll ever get,
not a Ticket to Hollywood
Give it back!
Ticket to Hollywood,
Ticket to Hollywood
Give it back!
Ticket to Hollywood,
Ticket to Hollywood
Give it back!
Ticket to Hollywood, Ticket
to Hollywood Give it back!
Ticket to Hollywood, Ticket
to Hollywood Give it back!
Gimme gimme gimme, gimme my ticket
Gimme gimme, gimme my ticket
No no no no no no no,
monsieur no no
No no no no, monsieur no no
My Ticket to Hollywood
No Ticket to Hollywood
My Ticket to Hollywood
No Ticket to Hollywood
lf my eyes were a crystal palace blue
Walk right in, wouldn't you?
Just for one day if not two
What's life without you..
lt's stubborn as a mule
So heartless it's uncool
When this heart gets set on something
it gets set in stone
You're the queen of France
l'm just a whistler in a trance
Trust me baby where l come from
that's not how it's done
No no monsieur, no no,
it ain't that simple now
Go get lost somehow
Or else give me back,
my Ticket to hollywood.
Ticket to Hollywood,
Ticket to Hollywood
Give it back!
Ticket to Hollywood,
Ticket to Hollywood
Give it back!
Ticket to Hollywood, Ticket
to Hollywood Give it back!
Ticket to Hollywood, Ticket
to Hollywood Give it back!
Dunked in dew, a peppermint drop,
you waft so cool and fresh
A thread cut kite soaring away,
a sliced cloud caress
Give it back..
Ticket to Hollywood! Ticket
to Hollywood! Ticket to..
Okay enough.. it's not funny anymore.
You want to go don't you?
You go then..
Hollywood would suit you best..
Huffy Bhai and l wouldn't
fit in all that glamour..
We got some kicks while waiting
for the results..
..that's enough for us..
You'll take pictures won't you..
..remember to send me..
l'll see Hollywood through your eyes.
Take.. take..
To hell with your ticket..
Why did you make me run then?
l want Thukral not the ticket..
l was waiting..
Thukral will come..
l will hug him..
..he will kiss me..
How many Thukrals do you know?
Only one stupid, idiot, moron, Thukral
..who came back for his lottery
ticket, not for me.
Whatchyasaying?
Just go to hell..
Don't be angry.. please..
Thukral actually came back for you..
..all the time dreaming of
going to Hollywood with you.
Then why didn't he ask me?
You're Miss World..
..and he's Rikki Thukral..
..even if he touched you,
you'd get spoiled..
Didn't get spoiled using his hanky..
..in fact, became more beautifuler..
There'll only be one
bed for two people.
We can adjust..
..it's only for seven days..
Seven days that's it?!
Thukral was thinking of adjusting
his entire life with you.
Full life adjust.
Ok..
Whatchyasaying?!
l'm saying l love Thukral, you idiot.
l love you Anaida!
You sacrificed the ticket on her?!
The moment she said my cut..
..that was the turning
point of my innings..
That's when l made up my mind,
she was just my type..
Ticket was no big deal, l'd
have sacrificed my life.
Must admit..
What?
You're a die-hard romantic.
Whatchyasaying?
Moment ago you couldn't even share
the table with me and now..
And now what?
Now..
..your turn.. tell me..
..how did you meet your fiance?
Now don't be an aunty ji.
Oh l get it.. arranged is it?
Boy from Birmingham.. five figure
salary, good moral character..
- Hobbies cricket and.. - Rubbish..
So it's not arranged?
Superman brought us together.
He sells comic books?
Have you been to Madame Tussaud's,
the wax museum?
Of course l've been..
..they have several
models of our guys..
Gandhi ji, Nehru ji, lndira
ji, Ash ji, Amit ji..
..our good ol' Bachchan..
..very few of your Pakistanis..
Anyway.. so you went to Tussaud's ..
.. with my cousin Humera..
There was a Superhero Special
at Madame Tussaud's..
Batman, Hawkman, Aquaman, Superman..
..giant sized models everywhere..
Humera, my cousin was jumping from
one to the other screaming..
.. Aapi take a picture of this..
.. Aapi take a picture of that..
Watch out!
lf the fake Superman had fallen
on me, it'd have squashed me..
But the real Superman saved my life..
l was dying to kiss him
and say l love you..
So.. you kissed him?
Didn't even say l love you.
l took an oath when l
was six years old..
Dear God l will never fall in love with
a dark-skinned Pakistani or lndian..
Please find a nice white-skin British
man just like yourself to marry me.
Amen
- Hello. - Hi..
Sorry, l'm on the phone
Yeah this is Steve..
Bollocks! l've already said
l don't want his case..
Don't ever call me again..
Your name's Steve?
Yeah..

Mum British..
Dad Punjabi..
Ouch! My foot.. God it hurts.
Left or right?
Both..
You were badly hurt?
No silly.. l pretended

Way to go boss, l'd

..but what about the oath?
He is half Brit isn't he..
..so l compromised.
Must admit..
Drink something
l'll have .. Pepsi!
No not Pepsi, Seven Up..
Actually Tango..
..and chips, cookies
and that chocolate..
l was praying that a
miracle would happen.
..and Humera would vanish forever..
..and not ruin the foot massage.
Those fingers were just magical
Fingers so delicate, arms so strong..
..he carried me all the
way to my bedroom..
He was forcing Michelle to dance ..
Michelle?
Yeah.. that's her name..
Michelle didn't want to dance..
..but he insisted..
l stopped him ..
He hit you so hard?
Just a scratch.
He's still going through
plastic surgery..
So then you and Michelle .. Got
married or still dating?
She wasn't the one.
O ..
Your parents are amazing ..
He barged into your bedroom
and they didn't even mind.
Why would they .. he saved
their daughter ..
Papa-Mama had found
their son-in-law..
Son-in-law!
You met the thug an hour ago.. and
you're already planning marriage..
Thug!
With a foot-long scar on his face..
has to be a thug!
Forget it l'm not telling
you the rest of the story.
Ok sorry..
You get stuck in these small details.
The flavour is all in
the small details ..
How did he look..
What did he say..
How did he touch..
Where did he touch..
Ok so who touched what where?
Good night.
Don't let Superman bite.
Good night.
Shit! Phone number!
Steve..

Find it funny.. l was in such pain..
You lied..
lf you lie ..
..it always catches up with you.
Lie, go ahead and lie..
..but make sure it's palatable..
..Huffy Bhai says.
So then you limped all
the way to meet him.
l hopped, skipped and
jumped to his office..
..but as l entered the edifice..
l was psyched..
lt's not that l have holes
in my pockets..
..but this guy was bigger
than Prince Charles..
A snap of his fingers..
..and all the Bond Street beauties
would line up at his door..
For a moment l was scared..
..then l thought,
let's deal with it.
Hi Al ..
Al?
How do you know..?
Friends call you Al..
Mama-Papa call you Allo ..
Allo's cute ..
Please! Sounds like the
name of a fat cat.

or a gangster?
Are you a gangster or
a police officer..

Yes you have..
..You made me fall in love with you.
What do you do in such a huge office?

Pretty close.
We're lawyers. Singh and
Smith and Company..
You're Steve Singh of 'Singh

You're so .. so ..
Horrible?
And young too..
Now explain the pictures..
You're not going to decorate

Not a bad idea..
Steve!
Okay look ..

Propose?!
How does the board know about us?
The board knows everything ..

The proposal is that you

..and appoint me your lawyer..
But don't accept this proposal..
l've done my duty.
l'll tell the Board of Directors..
..that you've refused.
But why don't you want me
to sue Madame Tussaud's?
lf l wasn't in love with
you, l'd love you to.
Within seconds l would've gotten
you to sign the papers ..
Within days.. l would've
used you as a client..
lf, l wasn't in love with you..
How much money?
About a million ..
Million pound!
Wow! Million pounds?
Champagne or juice?

But l want to get involved.
You've done so much for me ..
..the least l can do is help you.
Al ..
..you're such a simple girl..
Who says l'm simple?
Come let's fix the deal ..

commission from the compensation.
..but if we lose, it's your loss.
Smart girl!
Steve said the same thing.
Smart girl.
Okay .. deal.
- To Superman! - To Superman!
This isn't the right time.
Why?
lt's eight thirty..
too early for you?
Ms. Khan ..

..our relationship should stay
professional till we win the case..
Till then ..
Let's stay away.
Too much..
lsn't it.
Really too much. Really.
How did he stop himself
at the last moment?
Not everybody can do that ..
you need to have balls.
This is called self control.
This is called.. class.
Just look at her.. my client.
Does she want riches?
No.
Does she want revenge? No my lord.
She wants your compassion,
your sympathy..
..and my love..
Hey! Stay away from
the Kiss of Love..
O they kill me, those tangy eyes
Kiss of love, kiss of love
Falling stars fill up my skies
Kiss of love, kiss of love
O they kill me, those tangy eyes
Kiss of love, kiss of love
Falling stars fill up my skies
Kiss of love, kiss of love
O when l steal a peek into your eyes
You rob me of a breath
O when l steal a peek into your eyes
You rob me of a breath
O shut them tight O shut those eyes
They're raiders running red
Kiss of love, kiss of love, stay
away from the kiss of love
Kiss of love, kiss of love, stay
away from the kiss of love
O the helpless trappings
Of this brazen heart
A night seems like eternity
When it's spent apart
Your love has made me many things
A weaver, too, of dreams
l lie awake a thousand years
Sleep a thousand it seems
When you drop your bashful gaze
The stars come tumbling down
O shut them tight O shut those eyes
They're raiders running red
Kiss of love, kiss of love, stay
away from the kiss of love
Kiss of love, kiss of love, stay
away from the kiss of love
The English court of Law decides
the case in favour of Ms. Khan.
To you, my plea
Do your duty
Touch my pulse
And set me free
Don't turn back for
a peek at the world
You might trip and tumble down
With a foot thump swing
in dance and a twirl
This moment will come around
When you drop your bashful gaze
The stars come tumbling down
O shut them tight O shut those eyes
They're raiders running red
Kiss of love, kiss of love, stay
away from the kiss of love
Stay away, stay away, stay
away from the kiss of love
Kiss of love, kiss of love, stay
away from the kiss of love
Stay away, stay away, stay
away from the kiss of love
Kiss of love, kiss of love, stay
away from the kiss of love
Kiss of love, kiss of love, stay
away from the kiss of love
Hey! Stay away from the kiss of love

You must be doing something
to tempt him.

Just imagine..

..and Anaida and Steve had bumped
into each other on the train..
Now just suppose..
..if Steve-Anaida had met..
had coffee together..
..chatted up..
..you think they would've hit it off?
Fallen in love?
Then Steve would've
been Anaida's Rikki..
..and Anaida would've
been Steve's Alvira.
Then what would've happened
to Rikki and Alvira?
You flirting?
What do you mean by Rikki and Alvira?
Why don't you just say you and l..
Right ok..
..if we had met, just like that..
l mean..
..if Steve and Anaida were
out of the picture..
Then what would've happened?
Say..
Pluck threads of light from
the weave of the moon
And knit yourself a veil
Pluck threads of light from
the weave of the moon
And knit yourself a veil
lf l'm shy l'll face
your warm embrace
Entwine your breath in mine
Hold me halke halke
Hold me halke halke
Your lips so halke
halke Hold me halke
Hold me halke halke
Hold me halke halke
Your lips so halke
halke Hold me halke
Here's the Taj Mahal.
A red stone Taj?
lt is the Taj. Someone's
painted it red.
Tell me this monument's
name, or l'll leave.
King Humayun's Tomb.
Didn't have the money to take you
to Agra and show you the real Taj.
Sorry.
From today Humayun's Tomb
is the Taj for me..
As beautiful as our love..
Come exchange your sleep for mine
Give me a dream, take one from me
There's one dream trapped
inside these eyes
One beneath a pillow moon
Let's put to bed this sleepless sky
Come join me in a lullabye
Hold me halke halke
Hold me halke halke
Your lips so halke
halke Hold me halke
Hold me halke halke
Hold me halke halke
Your lips so halke
halke Hold me halke
One should cover their head before
entering a Gurdwara
Even in the Dargah.
Must cleanse your body before
offering prayers to the Gurdwara..
Same at the Dargah.
What l get from my Guru, will
l get from your shrine?
They both house the love divine..
My devotion is your devotion..
Your love is my love..
lt took us an endless age to say
Two words, one eternal thought
That one day seemed a hundred years
Another hundred the night forgot
How would it be if soft,
slow, silent
Eternity were in a moment caught
Hold me halke halke
Hold me halke halke
Your lips so halke halke
Taj!
No, Humayun's Tomb.
As beautiful as our love.
No profit, no loss,
no virtue, no sin..
Love infinite love..
Marry me.
Then every year we'll celebrate
our wedding anniversary..
..right here at Taj.
Every year Taj?
Promise.
l accept.
Pluck threads of light from
the weave of the moon
And knit yourself a veil
lf l'm shy l'll face
Your warm embrace
Entwine your breath in mine
Hold me halke halke
Hold me halke halke
Your lips so halke halke
Hold me halke
Hold me halke halke
Hold me halke halke
Your lips so halke halke
Hold me halke
So..
What would've happened
between us..
..if Steve and Anaida
weren't in the picture?
What would've happened?
Would've been war.
Right..
.. war.
Nothing else could've happened.
No chance at all..
The train coming in from Birmingham
has arrived on Platform number 3.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Train's come too soon.
Soon?
Late by two hours..
Late it is but still
too soon isn't it?
Sorry?
You go get your doughnuts.
Bye.
