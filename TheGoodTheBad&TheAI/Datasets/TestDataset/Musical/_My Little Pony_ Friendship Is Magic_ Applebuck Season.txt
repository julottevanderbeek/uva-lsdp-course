Applejack: Boy, howdy. I got my work cut out for me.
That there's the biggest bumper crop o'apples I ever laid eyes on.
Big Macintosh: Ee-yup. Too big for you t'handle on yer own.
Applejack: Come on, big brother! You need to rest up and get yourself better.
I haven't met an apple orchard yet that I can't handle.
Oops! Sorry...
I'll take a bite outta this job by day's end.
Big Mac: Biting off more than you can
chew is just what I'm afraid of.
Are you sayin' my mouth is makin' promises my legs can't keep?
Yup.
Why, of all the- This is your sister Applejack, remember?!
The loyalest of friends and the most dependable of ponies?
But still only ONE pony.
And ONE pony plus HUNDREDS o'apple trees just doesn't add up.
Don't you use yer fancy "mathematics" to muddy the issue!
I said I can handle this harvest and I'm gonna prove it to you.
I'm gonna get every last apple out of those
trees this applebuck season all by myself.
My Little Pony, My Little Pony, ah, ah, ah, ah,
Twilight: I used to wonder what friendship could be
Until you all shared its magic with me
Rainbow Dash: Big adventure
Pinkie Pie: Tons of fun
Rarity: A beautiful heart
Applejack: Faithful and strong
Fluttershy: Sharing kindness
Twilight: It's an easy feat
All: And magic makes it all complete, yeah
Do you know you're all my very best friends
Well, I better get kickin'.
These apples aren't gonna shake themselves outta the trees.
Hey!
Oh no!
STAMPEEEEEEDE!
Pinkie Pie:  He-e-ey! Thi-i-is ma-a-akes my-y-y-y voi-i-ice so-o-ound silly-y-y!
Pinkie Pie! Are you crazy?! Run!
Everypony calm down. There is no reason to panic!
Rarity: But mayor! Whatever shall we do?!
Rainbow Dash: Look there!
Applejack: YEE-HAW!
Move aside, Winona.
Applejack: Herd'em up, girl!
Pinkie Pie: This is the best rodeo show I've ever seen!
Come on, little doggie!
Herd!
Applejack:  Winona, put'em up.
Applejack: Ha HA! That's it!
Applejack:  Attagirl. Yeehaw!
Applejack: Whoooooa!
Hoo-wee!
Now, what was THAT all about?
Oh, my! Begging your pardon, Applejack,
but Mooriella here saw one of those nasty snakes.
And it just gave us ALL the willies, don'tcha know!
I completely understand.
Just next time, try and steer clear o'Ponyville.
We certainly will, Applejack. So long, Winona!
Applejack: Yee-haw!
Pinkie Pie: Yee-haw! Ride'em, cowpony!
Mayor: Applejack was just...just...
Pinkie Pie: Apple-TASTIC!
Exactly!
We must do something to thank Applejack for single-hoofedly saving the town.
Pinkie Pie: I know! A PARTY!
Twilight: We all ready?
Just one last thing.
Rarity: NOW we're ready.
Is Applejack all set?
Rainbow Dash: Actually, I haven't seen her all week.
Pinkie Pie: Not since the stampede.
Rainbow Dash: But she'll be here for sure. Applejack is NEVER late!
Twilight: Welcome, everypony!
Today we are here to honor a pony we can always
count on to help in matters great and small.
A pony whose contributions to-
Rainbow Dash: Did you see Applejack's swift moves out there?!
What an ATHLETE!
This week, she's gonna help me with my new flying trick,
and I know it's gonna be  so awesome!
Twilight: EXACTLY. And-
Pinkie Pie: This week, I get to run
Sugar Cube Corner for the first time!
Twilight: What does that have to do with Applejack?
OH!
Applejack, one of the best bakers EVER, is gonna help me!
Applejack makes everything great, so FREE SAMPLES FOR EVERYPONY!
Twilight: Hokay, that's great.
Twilight: Now, if I could just make a
point without being inter-
Fluttershy: Twilight? Twilight: -rupted...
Fluttershy: Twilight, I'm so sorry,
but I just wanted to mention that Applejack is also
helping me this week with the official bunny census,
where we count up all the new baby bunnies that were born this season.
She's gonna help gather them using her wonderful herding skills.
Twilight:  Anyone else?
Anyone?
Twilight: No?
Well, then. As I was trying to say-
Never mind.
And so, with no further ado,
it is my privilege to give the prized Pony of Ponyville Award
to our beloved guest of honor,
a pony of the utmost trustworthiness,
reliability, and integrity,
Ponyville's most capable and dependable friend, Applejack!
Spike: Cool, way to go, Applejack! That was awesome! I mean- heh...
Spike:  Awkward.
Applejack:  I'm here! I'm here...
Sorry I'm late-whoa!  Was I just-
Did I get your tail?
Miss Mayor, thank you kindly for this here...award...thingy...
It's so bright and shiny and...heh...heheh...
I sure do look funny, heh...
Applejack and Pinkie Pie: Woooowooooowoooo!
Twilight: Oookay. Well, thank you, Applejack,
for saving us from that scary stampede,
and always being there for everypony.
Yeah...I like helpin' the ponyfolk and...
and stuff...
Oh! Uh...yeah, thanks!
Twilight: Was it just me, or did Applejack seem a little-
Rainbow Dash: Tired?
Fluttershy: Dizzy?
Rarity: Messy?
Well, did you SEE her mane?!
Pinkie Pie: She seemed fine to me. WOO! WOO!
Twilight: What on earth is that pony doing?!
Applejack: Whoops...
Twilight: Hey, Applejack!
Twilight: Applejack!
Twilight: Applejack!
Twilight: APPLEJACK!
Applejack: Oh!
Applejack: H-howdy, Twilight!
Twilight: What IS all this?!
Applejack: I-it's applebuck season!
Applejack:  Wh-whoa!
Twilight: Applewhat season?
Applejack:  It's what the Apple Family calls harvesting time.
We gather all the apples from the trees so we can sell 'em.
Twilight: But...why are you doing it all alone?
Applejack: 'Cause Big Macintosh hurt himself.
Twilight: What about all those relatives I met when I first came to Ponyville?
Can't they help?
Applejack:  They were just here for the Apple Family Reunion.
They actually live all over Equestria and are busy harvestin' their own orchards.
So, uh, I'm on my own.
Which means I should really get back to work.
Applejack:  Hint-hint?
Applejack: Get back to work?
Twilight: Fine.
Applejack:  Uh, could you step aside, Twilight?
Twilight: I just did...  Applejack, you don't look so good...
Applejack:  Don't any a'you three
worry none, I'm just fine and dandy.
Applejack:  Wh-whoa...
Twilight: Do you...want some help?
Applejack: Help?! No way, no how.
Twilight: But there's no way you can do it all on your own!
Applejack: Is that a CHALLENGE?
Twilight: Um...no?
Applejack: Well, I'm gonna PROVE t'you that I can do it!
Now, if you'll EX-KYUUSE me, I've got apples t'buck.
Rainbow Dash: THERE you are!
Applejack:  I'm a-mite sorry, Rainbow...
I was busy applebuckin' and I guess I-
I closed my eyes for a second, and
when I woke up, I was late.
Now, what's this new trick a'yours?
Rainbow Dash: See this contraption?
Applejack: Uh, yeah...
Rainbow Dash: Well, I'm gonna stand on one end,
Rainbow Dash: Well, I'm gonna stand on one end,
then you're gonna jump down from that platform,
launching me into the air faster than I can take off on my own.
Once I'm in the air, I'm gonna do some AMAZING flips and spins
that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts.
Isn't that a mite dangerous?
Heh, not for a pony who can fly.
Well, all righty, then!
Applejack:  Oh my...
Ready?! One...two...
THREE!
Uh, maybe I wasn't clear. You're supposed to land ON the other end.
Applejack:  Got it...
Rainbow Dash: Applejack, what the hay is goin' on?!
I mean, I THOUGHT I was working with Ponyville's best athlete!
You ARE! I'm okay...
Really...I-I have an idea.
Watch this.  Ta-da.
Applejack: Oh...maybe not...
Okay, one more try. I'm sure to get it this time.
Applejack: Heh heh...he-here I go!
Rainbow Dash: WAIT!  APPLEJAAaaaaack...
Applejack:  You're welcome!
Can I help you?
I think somepony else needs your help...
Twilight:  Applejack?
Rainbow Dash: Yep.
Applejack:  OW!
Twilight: Applejack, can we talk?
Twilight:  Applejack, can we talk?
Applejack: CAN BEES SQUAWK?! I-I DON'T THINK SO...
Twilight: No. Can we talk?
TWENTY STALKS?! BEAN OR CELERY?
No! I need to talk to you!
YOU NEED TO WALK TO THE ZOO?! WELL, WHO'S STOPPIN' YOU?
I NEED to TALK to you!
OH! WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?! WHATCHA WANNA TALK ABOUT?
Rainbow Dash dropped in to see me today!
THAT'S QUITE NEIGHBORLY OF HER.
YES, EXCEPT THAT SHE CRASHED ONTO MY BALCONY
AFTER YOU LAUNCHED HER INTO THE AIR.
Oh, yeah...I wasn't feelin' quite myself this mornin'...
Because you're working too hard, and you need HELP!
What? Kelp?! I don't need kelp. I don't even like seaweed!
HELP! YOU NEED HELP!
Nothin' doin', Twilight.
I'm gonna prove t'you...t'everypony...that I can do this ON MY OWN.
Ugh...now if you'll EXCUSE me, I've gotta go help Pinkie Pie...
Mrs. Cake: Now, Pinkie Pie, are you SURE you're up to
baking the muffins and running the store this afternoon?
Yessirree bob, Mrs. Cake!
Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help me out.
Why, she's the best baker EVER! Right, Applejack?
Mr. Cake: No? You're not the best baker ever?
What?! Oh no! I mean, don't you fret.
I can bake anything from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye.
Mrs. Cake: Ohoho! Well, all right! Well, see you later, girls!
Pinkie Pie: Stop with the shakin', it's time to get bakin'!
All righty! I'll get the sugar and the eggs.
Can you get me some chocolate chips?
E-eh, uh...wh-what was that?
Chocolate chips!
"Chips"...got it. Tater chips...
All salty'n'dry...okie-dokie.
Applejack:  What next?
Baking soda!
"Soda"...
Perfect! That'll get the tater chips nice'n'wet.
Applejack:  NOW WHAT?
Pinkie Pie:  A cup of flour.
A cup of sour?!
Well, lemons are sure sour.
Applejack: One cup o'sour comin' up.
Anything else, Pinkie?
Pinkie Pie: One last thing. Wheat germ.
Wheat worms?!
Oh! That must be fancy talk for earthworms!
Pinkie Pie: Now THAT'S gonna be DELICIOUS!
Applejack: If you say so...
Pinkie Pie: FREE MUFFIN SAMPLE SPECTACULAR!
Yeah! Muffin spectacles! Get'm while they're hot!
Twilight: We came as soon as we heard!
Nurse: Oh, thank you, Twilight. We need all the help we can get!
Oh no! What happened?!
Nurse: It was a mishap with some of the baked goods.
Pinkie Pie:  No...not baked goods.
Baked BADS...
Applejack.
Spike:  Mm! Want one?
Applejack:  Wha?! Huh?!
Twilight: Applejack, we need to talk.
Whoa?! Huh?! Oh, it's you, Twilight...
I know what you're gonna say, but the answer is still no.
Not to upset your applecart, but you need help!
Applejack:  Hardy-har.  No, I don't.
Twilight: Here. Let me help.
Applejack: Help?! Nooo thanks.
A little more...
Little...
...There...
I'll prove that THIS apple can handle THESE apples!
Come on...apples...fall off!
Twilight: AJ? I think you're beating a dead...tree.
I-I knew that...
Twilight: Actually, Applejack, I had something else to talk to you about.
I just came back from Ponyville Urgent Care, and-
Applejack: Y'know, I'm a LITTLE busy to get lectured right now, Twilight...
Twilight: But if you'd just let me help-
Applejack: UGH! No...no...NO!
How many times do I gotta say it?!
I don't need NO help from NOpony!
Twilight: Uuugh. That pony is stubborn as a mule.
Twilight: No offense.
Mule: None taken.
Fluttershy: Oh, Applejack.
Thank you so much for offering your herding skills for the annual rabbit round-up.
Applejack:  Ugh. Why are we doin' this?
Well, lots of new baby bunnies have been born,
so it's my job to get a count of all the new families.
Applejack:  Fine. Can we just get on with it?!
Certainly. But remember, these are bunnies we're dealing with, not cows.
They're a timid bunch and need to be treated gently.
I do NOT need any direction on corralin' critters!
Right, WInona?!
Fluttershy: Okay, little bunnies.
I need you to all gather here in the middle.
Applejack:  That's right! Let's go, bunnies!
In the center! Hop to it!
...Swell. Just swell.
Put 'em up, Winona!
Fluttershy: Applejack! Winona! Stop! You're scaring them!
Applejack: We know what we're doin'!
Git along, little bunnies!
Fluttershy: Oh no...
STAMPEEEEEDE!
The horror, THE HORROR!
It was AWFUL!
A DISASTER! A horrible, horrible DISASTER!
Twilight: I don't get it.
Our gardens! Destroyed!
Every last flower, devoured!
By...by...  THEM!
Fluttershy:  Oh...oh my! Please stop, little bunnies.
Nono! Please! Let's go home!  Oh my goodness...
All right. Enough is enough.
Applejack:  Must...keep...buckin'...
Just...a few...more...must...finish...harvestin'...
Twilight: All right, Applejack.
Your applebucking hasn't just caused YOU problems,
it's over-propelled a pegasus,
practically poisoned plenty of ponies,
and terrorized bushels of brand new bouncing baby bunnies.
I don't care WHAT you say,
YOU. NEED. HELP.
Applejack:  Heh! No I don't!
Look! I did it!
I harvested the entire Sweet Apple Acres without yer help.
How'dya like THEM apples?!
Big Mac: Um...How do YOU like THEM apples?
Applejack:  A-a-apples...
Twilight:  Applejack?  Applejack!
Applejack: Huh...?
Oh good. You're okay.
Now Applejack, I completely respect the Apple family ways.
You're always there to help anypony in need,
so maybe you can put a little of your stubborn pride aside
and allow your friends to help you?
Okay, Twilight.
I am not taking "no" for an answer-  What?!
Yes, Twilight.  Yes, please...
I could really use your help...
Twilight:  "Dear Princess Celestia,
My friend Applejack is the best friend a pony could ever have,
and she's always there to help anypony.
The only trouble is,
when she needs help,
she finds it hard to accept it.
So, while friendship is about giving of ourselves to friends,
it's also about accepting what our friends have to offer.
Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."
How 'bout y'all take a little break?
Applejack: I got some fiiine apple juice waitin' for ya.
Girls, I can't thank you enough for this help.
I was actin' a...bit stubborn.
A bit?!
Okay, a MITE stubborn.
And I'm awful sorry.
Now, I know the town gave me the Prized Pony Award,
but the real award is havin' you five as my friends.
Phew! That applebucking sure made me hungry!
Spike: And I've got the perfect treat!
Pinkie Pie: Eeewww!
Spike, I threw those away! Where'd you get them?!
From the trash.
Spike: Just a liiittle nibble?
Spike: Come on!
My Little Pony
My Little Pony
My Little Pony, friends
