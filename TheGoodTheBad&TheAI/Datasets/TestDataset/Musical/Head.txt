- Okay?
-
-
- Folks, it'll be just a few minutes.
-
- Mayor, I think we're ready to go.
Good.
- Ah, Bill, will you take this, please?
- This way, sir.
Mr. Mayor! Got the -
Oh. Perfect. Thank you, Bill.
- Here we are, sir.
- Thank you.
- Uh, ladies and gentlemen -
-
- I hereby -
-
Ladies and gentlemen, I -
Testing, one, two.
- Ladies and gentlemen, I -
-
-
- Ladies and -
Testing, one, two.
Um...
- ladies and gentlemen -
-
-
-
Um, uh, ladies and gentlemen...
I hereby dedicate this...
magnificent marvel
of modern architecture...
one of the largest
suspended-arch bridges in the world...
to the people of -
-
-
My, my
The clock in the sky
is pounding away
There's so much to say
A face, a voice
An overdub has no choice
An image cannot rejoice
Wanting to be
To hear and to see
Crying
To the sky
But the porpoise is laughing
Good-bye, good-bye
Good-bye, good-bye
Good-bye
Clicks, clacks
Riding the backs of giraffes
for laughs
Is all right for a while
The ego sings
Of castles and kings
And things that go
with a life of style
Wanting to feel
To know what is real
Living is a lie
Is a lie
The porpoise is waiting
Good-bye, good-bye
Good-bye, good-bye
Good-bye
Good-bye, good-bye
Good-bye
Good-bye, good-bye
Good-bye
Well?
Even.
Um -
Why don't you come back later
when the guys aren't here?
Are you kidding?
Hey, now, wait a minute.
Now, wait just a minute.
Hey, hey, we are the Monkees
You know we love to please
A manufactured image
with no philosophies
We hope you like our story
although there isn't one
That is to say, there's many
That way there is more fun
You've told us you like action
and games of many kinds
You like to dance, we like to sing
So let's all lose our minds
We know it doesn't matter
'cause what you came to see
Is what we'd love to give you
and give it one, two, three
But it may come three, two, one, two
or jump from nine to five
And when you see the end in sight
the beginning may arrive
For those who look for meanings
in form as they do fact
We might tell you one thing
but we'd only take it back
Not back like in a box back
Not back like in a race
Not back so we can keep it
but back in time and space
You say we're manufactured
To that we all agree
So make your choice and we'll rejoice
in never being free
Hey, hey, we are the Monkees
We've said it all before
The money's in, we're made of tin
We're here to give you more
The money's in
We're made of tin
-  We're here to give you -
-
We love the Monkees! We love the Monkees!
We love the Monkees!
We love the Monkees!
We love the Monkees!
We love the Monkees!
Gimme a "W"!
"W"!
- Gimme an "A"!
- "A"!
- Give me an "R"!
- "R"!
- What does it spell?
- War!
Can't see.
It's too deep.
- What'd you say?
- I said, I can't see. It's too deep.
- I've gotta have a boost or something.
- Here, you can stand on my helmet.
It's too heavy. I don't wanna wear it.
It's a drag. It presses down on my head.
You really oughta wear your helmet.
- What for?
- You might get a shot in the head, for one thing.
A shot in the head. Wow.
Why didn't you say a shot in the arm
or a shot in the leg?
A sniper could be on top of that mountain
and blow off the right half of my chest...
or a plane could come zooming in through
that pass and drop a bomb on my head.
-  Well, I'm wearing mine.
- That's cool.
All right, need a volunteer.
We're out of ammo.
- I'll go.
- See that you do.
Hold it! This is for Life!
-
- Excu -
West tank team, west tank team, reverse!
Is someone here?
We're number one! We're number one!
We're number one!
- Mr. One -
-
May I - Number -
Actually, I was just here about some ammo.
-
- Uh, Mr. One?
- Day in and day out!
- Excuse me, sir -
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?
-
- Oh, boy.
- I need this game over.
-
He'll never make it through
this intense bombardment.
Nobody could.
Here, Mick. I got this for you.
- I thought you'd like it better.
- Wow! Stars! Hey, that's great, Pete!
- Okay, you guys ready?
-
Okay, guys. Let's hit that line.
Aah!
Circle sky
Telling lies
Here I stand
Happy man
And it looks like
we've made it once again
Yes, it looks like
we've made it once again
Color sound
All around
Wing tip smile
Sees for miles
And it looks like
we've made it once again
Yes, it looks like
we've made it once again
It's a very extraordinary scene
To those who don't understand
But what you have seen
you must believe
If you can, if you can
Hey, mill town
Smiling down
Telling more
-  Than before
-
And it looks like
we've made it once again
Yes, it looks like
we've made it to the end
Bug out! Bug out!
-
- Watch it!
I gave her a very powerful narcotic,
and I'm sure it will be effective soon.
Barbara Stanwyck
may be in for a slight shock.
Her son, Anthony Dion Fay...
just sold a provocative story
about his relationship with Barbara -
Hiya, friends. Ralph Williams, owner
of the world's largest Ford dealership -
Your Majesty, he acknowledges
a king higher than you.
But you are the messiah.
Our ship better be sailing out of that harbor
on its way home within 24 hours...
or we're coming in after it.
Sounds like a lot
of supernatural baloney to me.
Supernatural, perhaps.
Baloney, perhaps not.
I don't read papers, I don't listen to the radio
and I haven't seen a television in years.
Uh, you make motion pictures,
don't you?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- You're always looking for talent.
- Yes.
- Watch this.
-
-
- What happened?
Here at the world's largest
Ford dealership, we -
The world's largest Ford dealership -
Enter the world's largest Ford dealer.
My canteen is empty...
where once it was full.
I felt I couldn't go on.
I... can't.
But something -
something kept telling me I must.
- You must!
- I must.
Oh, no!
No, no! No!
No!
No!
Things go better with Coca-Cola
Things go better with Coke
Pathetic.
I can't.
- It's pitiful.
- Shut up.
-You shut up.
- No, you shut up.
-You shut up!
- Shut up!
- You!
- You, you, you, you, you!  You!
Okay, I will.
I can't - I can't hear her.
No. I'm deaf! Come back!
I'm going de -
Quiet, isn't it...
George Michael Dolenz?
I said, quiet, isn't it...
George Michael Dolenz?
Psst!
Hyah!
-
- What?
Americano?
W-Wh-What?
Ma sei americano?
- Americano.
-
Americano, eh?
Surrender.
Oh - Boom-boom. Surrender.
You know.
Surrender. Oh!
Something doesn't change
There is only one
Always changing inside
What does it become
Can you dig it
Do you know
Would you care to
Let it show
Those who know it use it
Those who start it die
To sing that you can dig it
Is to make your summer fly
Then can you dig it
Do you know
Would you care to
Let it show
Can you dig it
Do you know
Would you care to
Let it show
There is only feeling
In this world of life and death
I sing the praise of never change
With every single breath
Can you dig it
Do you know
Would you care to
Let it show
Quick. Suck it before the venom
reaches my heart.
-
-
What heart?
When you're finished there...
you can help me by pulling...
- this painfully barbed savage's arrow -
-
-
- first by snipping the head off in the back...
and then pulling it from the front,
quickly so that it doesn't hurt me.
-
-
- Are you gonna help me or not?
-
What about Davy and Peter?
I've sent them to Fort Bridger
for reinforcements...
on the possibility that our position
should be overrun.
Are you kidding?
What are we supposed to do here?
Hold on against insurmountable odds.
-
- What's with her?
Hey, come on. Get up, lady.
You're not dead.
Hey, lady, get up. Stop acting.
- Hey, what is this?
- Come on. Stop playing. It's all over. It's an act.
- Come on, get up.
- Stop kicking me.
I don't wanna do this anymore, man.
Oh, these fake arrows and this junk
and the fake trees.
Bob, I'm through.
It all stinks, man.
Hey, well, Micky, wait a minute!
Fake dirt, fake -
Well, Mick, wait a minute, man!
I'll go with ya! Wait. Hold it!
-
-
Aah!
I'm too old for excitement!
I been lookin' all over for you creeps!
Where you been?
Where you rats been?
You ain't holdin' out on me, are ya?
- No.
- No.
Don't give me that!
I been lookin' all over the world for ya!
Anyway, the idea is this.
Byproducts.
Imagine the tie-ins.
Blonde wigs for kids. Swords.
The whole phallic thing is happening!
I mean, why don't we
use classic things?
Millions! I'm tellin' ya, millions!
Hey! Nobody walks out on me!
Not even myself!
All right?
Come back, you guys!
Hey. Hey!
They're coming!
They're coming!
They're coming! They're coming!
- Who's that?
-  Oh, they're awful!
-
- I'm out of here.
I can't eat with
these stinkin' kids around here.
Who are the Monkees? Never heard of 'em.
-  Fine! Look at my cape!
-  Look at those guys.
-
-  Can't even have a decent lunch.
Look at that one kid.
Yeah, they're all the same.
Drinks on the house.
Well, if it isn't God's gift
to the eight-year-olds.
Just tryin' to please.
Changing your image, darling?
While you're at it, why don't you have them
write you some talent?
Hey, what's wrong?
- What's wrong with you?
- I asked you first.
- I ordered this, and I don't want it.
- Throw it away.
- I can't. There are starving -
- There are starving Chinese, yeah.
- This is serious.
- I'd like a finger sandwich, and hold the mold.
And, uh, I'd like a glass of cold gravy
with a hair in it, please.
One of your own?
Are you still paying tribute
to Ringo Starr?
- Would you like a pinch in the mouth?
- I'll think about it.
Don't hurt yourself.
And while you do, I would like
to order 12 Boff crackers...
and a cup of mushrooms, crisp.
Yes, and I'll throw in a side of mouthwash.
Phew! On the house.
Come on, let's get out
of this nightclub.
- But what about the food?
- Have it cleaned and burned. Come on, Pete.
Wait, wait, wait. Don't move.
I want to forget you just as you are.
Peter, come on, let's go.
Psst! Hey, come here.
Now, this is serious.
What do you say you and me go someplace
where we won't bump into each other again?
Get him!
-  One! Two!
- Stay down!
Three! Four!
Atta way! That's right!
-  One! Two!
- Stay down!
Three! Four! Five!
- Six!
- Stay down!
Get him! Get him!
- I'm tellin' him to stay down.
- He'd better.
The money says so.
Stay down. Stay down!
Please don't, Davy!
Davy, don't! Please don't!
Don't, Davy.
Please don't.
I have to do this.
But why do you have to?
Why?
What am I gonna do, play violin
in two-bit clubs all my life?
- But, Davy -
- Forget it. Pl -
Forget what Father Duffy and Ma
say about Carnegie Hall.
But you play so beautifully.
It isn't good enough.
You understand?
At this I could have been champ.
And you have to?
Their way?
That's right.
They pick the round,
and I pick the guy.
Don't worry, Theresa.
I won't get hurt.
- That's good. You made it.
- Yeah?
Got all the fighters up here.
- Anyone?
- Yeah.
Great. I'll have a go at him.
You won't hurt my face, will ya?
Million dollar head, this.
Why him, Davy?
Well, you know, I like him.
He looks like a nice guy. I like his smile.
Come on, see if you can hit me.
Just once. Just once.
- Stay down!
-  Get up! Get up!
Kill him! Kill him!
- I told him to stay down.
- Yeah? Well, he didn't hear ya.
Stay down, dummy!
- You're the dummy.
- No. No, no, he's the dummy.
- You're the dummy.
- No, no, he's the dummy!
You are the dummy, dummy!
No, he's the dummy!
I'm not the dummy! He's the - He's the -
Stay down, dummy!
Dummy, huh?
-
-
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
-  Micky? Micky. Micky.
-
I'm the dummy, Micky.
I'm always the dummy.
You're right, Pete.
You're always the dummy.
I forgot.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You're always the dummy, Pete.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm always the dummy.
I'm always the dummy.
Don't listen to them, Peter.
Don't listen to them, Peter.
They're wise guys. Punks.
All they want to do
is hurt people and abuse them.
- How do you feel now?
- Oh, comme ci, comme ça.
-
- All right, that's enough. Cut it. Print it.
-
- Good hit. That should be it.
Pete - I think we're on
another set, aren't we?
- Hey, Bob, that's not right, man.
- What?
You know, about hitting a girl.
Hey, Ace, was that all right, man?
- Did that look good?
- I thought it looked great.
But about hitting a woman and everything-
It's about the image. It's not right.
- Peter, I hate to interrupt.
- Yeah, it's for your niece. What's her name?
- Murray.
- Fellas, let's move over to the right.
- Thank you.
- John, was that right, man?
- Yeah.
- John, that's not right.
- Can you move over to stage five?
- It's a kid's -
- When you have a minute.
- It's a movie for kids. They're not gonna dig it.
- Just gotta make a wardrobe change, man.
- Tell Gene to put my clothes in the trailer.
- Gene Ashman, get the wardrobe ready!
- What's wrong?
- Good work, good work.
- No! It's not right!
No, Bob, it's for the image, man.
The kids aren't gonna dig it, me hitting a girl.
Especially the way I feel about
violence and all that stuff, you know.
All right, if it doesn't work,
we'll cut it out of the film.
Yeah, well, you tell me that, man,
and it never happens.
Peter, let's go.
We gotta get on the set. Hurry up, Pete!
Davy, did that look all right, man?
Hitting the girl?
- Sure, it was great. Great. Terrific.
- You thought so?
I can tell by
Your face
That you're lookin'
To find a place
To settle your mind
And reveal who you are
And you shouldn't
Be shy
For I'm
Not gonna try
To hurt you or heal you
Or steal your star
Open your eyes
Get up off your chair
There's so much to do
In the sunlight
Give up your secrets
And let down your hair
And sit with me here
By the firelight
Why think
About
Who's gonna
Win out
We'll make up our story
As we go along
There's so
Little time
For us
To try to rhyme
And so many highways
To travel upon
Open your eyes
Get up off your chair
There's so much to do
In the sunlight
Give up your secrets
And let down your hair
And sit with me here
By the firelight
I said, capable of 300 horsepower apiece...
and all on one pressure valve.
This crane has a lifting power
of over 300 tons.
Be careful there.
Don't lean over the edge.
We spend rather a good deal of our time here
ensuring a perfect working condition -
an interesting aspect
of the safety factor.
Hey, Peter -
Change one tape,
the entire process is regeared.
Leisure - the inevitable byproduct
of our civilization.
A new world whose only preoccupation
will be how to amuse itself.
The tragedy of your times, my young friends,
is that you may get exactly what you want.
Step lively, gentlemen.
Come on, Davy, let's go.
That which produces heat
is a thermodynamic process...
as opposed to mechanical,
which is a reversible process.
- Three men operate this entire department.
- Davy, come on!
Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.
The entire process is self-stimulated...
automated, regulatory.
Come on, Davy!
And to the degree that we are
capable of understanding...
these mechanical-electrical devices
as simple extensions of our brains...
to that same degree we are capable
of using these machines productively.
This way, gentlemen.
- Peter -
- Come along. Come along!
-  Sir?
-  What happened to the cand -
Hey, the door's stuck too, man!
-  We can't get out.
-
-  What?
-  What is that?
- I can't see anything.
- What's going on? What? What's that light?
- I can't see anything. Hey, hey!
Open up! What's happening?
- Hey!
All right, fellas.
Will you come forward, please?
-  Who's that?
- That's it. Come on up forward, huh, fellas?
-  Who - Who are you?
- Come on. Just keep coming forward.
That's it. That's it. All right.
Now, come on. Work your way closer to the -
That's it. Now you're doin' better. Come on.
A little faster, fellas. Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on. Get in there.
-  Where?
- Get in. Get inside.
-  In here?
- Get inside. Get inside, will you, please?
- That's the idea.
-  This is crazy.
- All right, now, jump up and down
a little, huh, fellas? Get lost in it.
-  Jump into this? What is this?
There you go. Very good.
Look, you're supposed to be dandruff, fellas.
- Will you work at it, please?
Jump up and down a little bit.
-  Dandruff?
-  All right. Playback, please.
-  There you go. That's much better.
-  Little action. Get lost in it.
-
-   Dandruff, dandruff
- That's better. Turn around.
We know it can be rough
-  But not if you get Tuff
- Settle down. Very good.
Turn around a little, will you?
-  We're Tuff, Tuff, Tuff
- Roll around up there.
-  Removes forever, removes forever
-
Tuff removes dandruff
Get Tuff
Okay, Vic.
That should be it for today. Thank you.
Ooh.
-  Oh, wow.
-  Wow!
Whoo. Look.
Ah, mother of pearl.
Hey, a cigarette and a -
Oh.
This is not one of your standard brands.
Oh! An El Zoomo!
Imagine having to smoke that whole thing.
Smoking may be hazardous to your health.
- You see that, Davy?
- Davy - Where's Davy?
- Hey, Davy.
- Davy.
- Davy.
- Hey, Davy. Davy. Davy?
- Maybe he's up the tube.
- Hey, you stuck up there, Davy?
- Davy!
- Boost me up.
- Somebody'll have to be on the bottom.
- Well, I'm the tallest and the strongest.
- So you're on the bottom.
I - Oh, well.
- Everybody's where they wanna be.
- Yeah. Ooh.
That was a particularly inept
thing to say, Peter...
considering that we are in a vacuum cleaner.
Davy!
Davy! Davy!
Davy!
Years ago I knew a man
He was my mother's biggest fan
We used to walk beside the sea
And he told me how life would be
When I grew up to be a man
Years ago we used to play
He used to laugh when I ran away
But when I fell and hurt my knee
he would run to comfort me
And the pain would go away
Years ago I knew a boy
He was his daddy's pride and joy
But when the daddy went away
It was such a rainy day
That he brought out all his toys
Now the mama did explain
Trying to take away the pain
But he just couldn't understand
That his father was not a man
And it all was just a game
The years have passed
And so have I
Making it hard for me to cry
And if and when
I have a son
Let it all be said and done
Let the sadness
Pass him by
-
-
- Ooh.
-
That song was pretty white.
Well, so am I. What can I tell ya?
You've been working on your dancing though.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, I've been rehearsing it.
Glad you noticed that.
Yeah, it doesn't leave much time
for your music.
You should spend more time on it...
because the youth of America
depends on you to show the way.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Monkees is the craziest people.
-
-
Did any of you cats see Micky
or Michael or Peter around here?
All right. All right. Come on out.
Oh. Okay. Wait a minute.
- Come on. Out!
- Hey, why are we stopped?
I don't even wanna hear
why or what from you. Just out!
- Oh, well, sure. Anything you say.
- Go on. Get out of here.
- Hi. What's goin' on?
- Come on. Move it. Out!
- Oh, hello, Officer. Certainly glad to see you.
- Come on, all of you.
- Move it.
- Officer, we were only just trying to I -
Don't even try it. Just out! Out of there.
- Sir, we -
- Shut up.
Okay, weirdos.
Just what were you doing in there?
And this better be straight.
You - Fuzzy Wuzzy.
- Uh, in the black thing, you meant, right?
- That's right.
- Yeah. What we were doing in there.
- Yeah. Yeah.
Well, first, uh - first it was -
uh, we were in a factory.
- Oh.
- Yeah. And then there was a commercial thing.
- No, no, no, no. It was a vacuum cleaner.
- Yeah, a vacuum cleaner, right.
Okay, boys. Let's go downtown.
But, sir, we were just looking for David Jones.
David Jones? Who's David Jones?
Thanks, guys.
I'll tell you what, man.
That cop must have thought
we were totally crazy.
He laid a hand on me.
Will you excuse me a minute, Mike?
Au contraire.
"Au contraire"?
Is that what he said?
He's crazy. They're all crazy.
Better not mess with me though.
Come on. Come on.
Put 'em up. Come on.
Ha!
They're crazy. Ha.
Hmm. Talk about police brutality.
Tsk.
Hi, mate. What's happening?
You all right?
Peter, don't!
I get it.
The old mirror routine, right?
Well, let me tell you one thing, son.
Nobody ever lends money
to a man with a sense of humor.
The Lancashire Midget Greenie!
-
-
Now, here's my plan.
Now, for the last time,
where is, uh, wh-what's-his-name?
- The greenie.
- David Jones, sir.
Yeah. Jones.
We told you a hundred times,
good officer, sir...
uh, we last saw him inside the john -
uh, comfort room.
All right. I believe you.
But if I get any more trouble out of you,
that's it for everybody.
- Sir, what about Davy?
- We'll find him, don't worry.
Now, out!
Victor Mature?
-
-
- Hey, how's about the door?
- Huh?
The buzz - Th-Th-The door.
-
- Oh, I'll get it. I'm sorry.
Well, I'm happy to bring it
to your attention.
Uh, oh, dear.
I got a wire for a Monkee.
- Thank you.
- I - It was - It's nothing.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
We all have loved ones, you know.
Peter?
Stop!
Stop? What is this "stop"?
Hey, Mick -
All right now. Come on.
What are you guys doin'?
Mick?
Now, look, man. This isn't funny.
Okay. You think
they call us plastic now, babe...
but you wait till I get through
telling them how we do it, huh?
- Okay, Micky.
-
Man, this telegram is as much for you
as it was for me.
Aw, come on, will you?
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, Mike.
-  Happy birthday to you
-
Happy birthday, dear Mike
Happy birthday to -
Do I have to do this all over again
Didn't I do it right the first time
Do I have to do this all over again
How many times
do I have to make this climb
Didn't I
Oh, didn't I
Can I see my way
to know what's really real
They say time can fix things by itself
I know life's more
than just some kind of deal
Yeah, but won't you tell me what all
When my soul comes off the shelf
Didn't I
Didn't I
Oh, didn't I
Do I have to do this all over again
Didn't I do it right the first time
Do I have to do this all over again
Oh, how many times
do I have to make this climb
Didn't I
Oh, didn't I
Oh, didn't I
Didn't I
Oh, didn't I
Oh, didn't - Oh, didn't I
Oh, didn't I, didn't I
Ah, Mike, you son of a gun.
A millionaire at 25.
- Ask me how does it feel.
- Huh?
- I said, ask me how does it feel.
- How does it feel?
- I'll tell you how it feels.
I don't like it - that's how it feels.
-
- I don't like surprises.
I don't like these people jumping out
and saying it - what -
- I don't even want to hear what you're saying.
-
'Cause you know what you're saying to me?
You're saying "happy birthday,"
and you're jumping out of the wall...
and it's scaring me to death,
and it's some kind of a big joke...
and I'm supposed to be happy about that.
"Aw, come on, Mike. Be a good sport."
Well, who needs this?
Who needs surprises and pajamas?
You want me to come to a party?
You don't kidnap me. You send me an invitation.
Besides, I may have been happier
where I was - sleepin'.
Happy birthday.
- Ha!
-
And I'll tell you something else too.
- The same thing goes for Christmas.
-
Well, now, wait a minute. That's -
Now, how about them apples?
-
-
-
-
-  Attaboy, Mike.
-
Attaboy, Mike.
- Attaboy, Mike.
-  Way to do it, Mike.
You tell 'em, Mike! Tell 'em!
Attaboy, Mike.
That-a-boy.
Attaboy, Mike.
Attaboy, Mike.
-  Attaboy, Mike.
-
Attaboy, Mike.
Boy, Mike.
Boy!
That-a - That-a-boy, Mike!
That-a-boy, Mike!
Boy, Mike!
That-a-boy, Mike!
Atta -
boy -
Mike!
-
- Boy, Mike!
Attaboy, Mike!
Attaboy, Mike!
Boys...
don't never...
but never...
make fun of no cripples.
- I do believe it's wrong, definitely.
-  What is?
Standing around and laughing at someone,
infringing on people's rights.
They laugh at you,
or they jump out of cars. They rob you.
Somebody'll come up and giggle at you.
That's a violation of your civil rights.
Skunk bait.
That's what the world is full of.
That's what it's based on.
That's what this economy is based on.
Are you telling me that you don't see
the connection between government
and laughing at people?
Listen, somebody's got a hang-up.
- I would take my belt off, and I would - wham!
-
He back talks me,
I slap him across the face.
Think they should be with fish...
and they - that way
they could only prey on fish.
- Possibly fines.
- Exile.
- Mental institution.
- Correction place.
I'd use a baseball bat on 'em.
- A good whack in the seat.
-
- They might even jeopardize the fish.
- Dogs!
- Not halibut.
- Contamination.
- The nuthouse.
- Alcatraz.
- Jail.
Guilty.
Guilty. Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty. Guilty.
- Guilty.

-  We were speaking of belief -
-
beliefs and conditioning.
All belief possibly could be said
to be the result of some conditioning.
Thus, the study of history...
is simply the study
of one system of beliefs deposing another.
And so on and so on and so on.
A psychologically tested belief
of our time...
is that the central nervous system...
which feeds its impulses
directly to the brain -
the conscious and subconscious -
is unable to discern between the real...
and the vividly imagined experience.
If there is a difference -
and most of us believe there is -
Am I being clear?
For to examine these concepts requires
tremendous energy and discipline.
To allow the unknown
to occur and to occur...
requires clarity.
Where there is clarity,
there is no choice...
and where there is choice,
there is misery.
But then why should anyone
listen to me?
Or should I speak...
since I know nothing?
How's about some more steam?
Sir?
Sir? Sir?
Hey. Excuse me.
-
- Hey, guys? Guys?
Hey, guys? Mike? Hey, Micky?
Hey - Hey, guys?
-
- Hey, Mike?
- Hey - Hey, Mick? Mike?
-
- Hey, Mike? Hey, Mick?
-
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it.
- Listen a minute. I got the -
- Hold it a minute. I say she won't.
Oh, sure she will, man.
Ten dollars says she will.
- Ten dollars, huh?
-  Gonna do it!
- Hey, Mike. Listen, man. I got the -
- Peter, don't be rude.
- Hey, Micky, listen. I got the answer.
- Shh.
Well, where's Davy?
- I swear, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna do it!
- Oh, never mind. I know anyway.
- What do you suppose he meant by that?
- Oh!
Hey, Davy. Listen, man, I -
Davy, I came here to t - tell you -
- It's all right, Davy. There's nothing wrong.
- Nothing wrong, huh?
That's right. I came here to tell you, man,
that everything's -
- You know what I saw in there?
- Yes.
An eye, man.
An eye this big - blood red.
It was as clear as the nose on your face.
It was looking at me.
- David. Peace, David. I know.
- You telling me nothing's wrong, huh?
- That's right, David. I came -
- Something's wrong with you, man.
You got a sheet on. You look weird.
I've gotta find out what's going on here.
- Who's to say what's normal, man?
- I'm telling you, there was an eye in there.
- I know. I came here to tell you about it.
- Three, four, five, six -
-  Oh, sorry, ma'am.
- seven -
Hey! Psst. Here.
Huh?
- Eight, nine, 10.
- Yeah. Thanks, babe.
- Hey, guys! Hey, guys?
- See you later, okay?
Hey, guys?
Hey, fellas!
Wait. Listen to me a minute.
Fellas!
- Guys.
- This way, gentlemen.
Hey, guys, you've got to listen to me, guys,
or you'll end up back in the box!
-
-  Hey.
-
-  Hey, what is this?
-  Hey, fella.
-  There's no way out.
-  Hey!
- No handle this side of the door.
-  Hey.
-  Hey, buddy!
-  These walls are solid steel, man.
-  Hey, buddy, you better open this door.
Hey, open it up!
Open the door! Let us out!
- What are you -
-  Oh, hey!
-  You better -
- Peter, what are you doing?
- Hey, Peter, what's with this room?
Yeah. What were you yelling outside?
I couldn't hear you - all the noise.
Hmm. But you'll listen now -
now that it's too late.
Come on, Peter.
"Come on, Peter." And before it was "Shut up,
Peter," and from you, "Don't be rude, Peter."
Now, look, Peter, if you know how to get out
of this box, man, you sure better tell me -
- Just cool it, Mike, will you? Just cool it.
Let him do it in his own time.
- Yeah, but - Oh!
- Thank you, David.
- Look, just take your time, Peter, man.
I'm with you all the way down the line.
You hear that? Right down the line.
Perhaps you'd like to sit down.
We were talking with the master...
regarding the nature
of conceptual reality.
- Psychologically speaking -
-
the human mind - or brain, or whatever -
is almost incapable
of distinguishing between the real...
and the vividly imagined experience.
Sound and film of music and radio -
even these manipulated experiences...
are received more or less directly...
and uninterpreted by the mind.
They are catalogued and recorded...
and either acted upon directly
or stored in the memory...
or both.
Now, this process...
unless we pay it tremendous attention...
begins to separate us
from the reality of the now.
Am I being clear?
For we must allow
the reality of the now...
to just happen...
as it happens.
Observe and act with clarity...
for where there is clarity...
there is no choice...
and where there is choice,
there is misery.
But then why should I speak...
since I know nothing?
Nothing?
You know nothing?
That's right.
You mean to tell me we've been sitting here
listening to you, and you know nothing?
- Well, take it easy, Davy.
- Easy?
What do you mean, "Take it easy"?
Now, we're stuck in a room.
We're stuck in this big, black box.
Now, you're telling me to take it easy,
and he's saying he don't know nothing.
- Now, what is this?
- Don't you see, David?
-
- It doesn't matter whether
we're in the box or not.
It's not important, huh?
Well, let me tell you something.
It's important to me.
I'll show you how to get out of this box.
You want to get out of this box?
This is how you get out.
This is how you get out.
-
-
-
-
- Where you boys headin'?
- We're just passin' through.
Ah, just passin' through?
You look like you're lost to me, don't they, fellas?
-  Davy.
-  This might be an awful good -
-
- We don't want any trouble.
Well, I'm telling you, unless I don't know
what goes on up and down this here block -
and I do -
you're in for plenty of trouble.
- Ain't that right, boys?
-
Prove it.
Where'd he get the cannon?
Oh!
-  What is this?
-  This isn't funny. I can't see.
Hey, open up! Come on!
Wait a minute. Stop. Stop.
-
-
Coca-Cola!
Coca-Cola!
-
-
-
- Out! Out!
-
-
Well, my son, what is it you have learned?
Make hay while the sun shines.
This box, right now,
composes our universe, so -
This is a flight attack jet aircraft...
whose primary mission
is the delivery of bombs and rockets...
against ground targets.
Basically, that's it.
Well, it's not my dress.
It's my Playtex Cross Your Heart bra.
Oh, how quaint.
Our universes only start from the inside of
our head and go out in all different directions -
in any direction till infinity.
You have a strange language, little one.
Me?
Mother! I'm coming!
I think I'm going to die from it.
Stop 'em, brothers!
Ooh! Oh!
Ladies and gentlemen...
I hereby dedicate this magnificent marvel
of modern architecture...
one of the largest
suspended-arch bridges in the world...
to the people of the greatest -

My, my
The clock in the sky is pounding away
There's so much to say
A face, a voice
An overdub has no choice
An image cannot rejoice
Wanting to be
To hear and to see
Crying
To the sky
But the porpoise is laughing
Good-bye, good-bye
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye
Clicks, clacks
Riding the backs of giraffes for laughs
Is all right for a while
The ego sings
Of castles and kings and things
That go with a life of style
Wanting to feel
To know what is real
Living is a lie
Is a lie
The porpoise is waiting
Good-bye, good-bye
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye
