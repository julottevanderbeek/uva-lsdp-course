Emma, stop, stop, stop.
Emma's left the building.
She say anything about me?
No, why would she?
Because I kissed her.
ARTIE: Mr. Shue, Finn,
thank you for agreeing
to this sit-down.
We've all noticed the tension
between you ever since Finn
admitted he kissed
Miss Pillsbury.
Sorry I'm late.
Huge line up at the Lima Bean,
but here are the lattes that
Mr. Shue made me get everybody.
Um, I asked for two pumps
of mocha, Finn.
I taste three. Take 'em back.
All of them.
I'm sorry, Mr. Shue, but all
I did was pick up the vests.
I didn't... What's most
upsetting is you actually think
these vests are clean,
that it's okay
to turn in subpar work.
No surprise.
Finn has been acting
like he's losing his mind.
Great job, Ryder!
See that, guys?
Prowess on the football field
a terrific singing voice
are not mutually exclusive.
I can't take it anymore!
Okay, it's bad enough you're
treating me like your lackey,
but I'm not gonna sit here
while you fake-compliment Ryder
just to hurt me!
You're feuding.
And it needs to stop.
Seriously. It's like
Hatfields and McCoys in here.
So epic musical feuds
is our theme.
And for the first time in Glee
Club history, we are giving you
our fearless leaders,
an assignment.
You two will explore
and resolve your differences
by performing a song together
inspired
by a classic musical rivalry.
Guys...
Regionals are coming up,
Mr. Shue, and if we're gonna
have any chance of winning,
we need both of you.
On the same page and
on the same team.
False alarm.
Thank God. I'm so happy.
I'm so glad
this is all over with.
Thank you
for taking me here today.
All right,
I'm gonna go to class.
Whoa, hey. That's it?
That's all you have
to say about this?
Well, the doctor gave me the
all-clear. What else is there?
Rachel, you can't just blow past
this like nothing ever happened.
This is a wake-up call.
This is an opportunity
for you to take a hard look
at the choices
that you're making,
where your life is heading.
Starting with Donkey Face.
Hey, I'm Dallas.
What's your name?
Uh, Gunnar.
Dude, relax.
I've seen you here
the past few weeks.
Look around.
We're not exactly alone.
Look, this isn't a
real thing for me, okay?
It's... I need it
for my tuition, you know?
Hey, man, I'm sure everyone
has a legit reason to be here.
Speaking of.
We'll talk about it.
Rule number one
Is that you gotta have fun
But, baby, when you're done
You gotta be
the first to run
Rule number two
Just don't get
attached to...
Somebody you could lose
So le-let me tell you
This is how
to be a heartbreaker
Boys... they like
a little danger
We'll get him falling
for a stranger, a player
Singing "I lo-lo-love you"
At least I think I do.
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
'Cause I lo-lo-love you
Girls... we do
whatever it will take
'Cause girls don't want
We don't want our hearts
to break... in two
So it's better to be fake
Can't risk losing
in love again, babe
This is how
to be a heartbreaker
Boys... they like
a little danger
We'll get him falling
for a stranger, a player
Singing "I lo-lo-love you"
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys... they like the look
of danger
We'll get him falling
for a stranger, a player
Singing I lo-lo-love you
At least I think I do
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
'Cause I lo-lo-love you.
At least I think I do.
You know
we only take cash, right?
Young Burt Reynolds,
may I gently remind you
that on Wednesday, December 5,
you joined the Cheerios!
But you've been conspicuously
absent from practice
since Thursday, December 6.
We've told you,
we only joined for a day
when we thought
Glee Club was disbanding.
And yet you signed
this legally binding contract
that clearly states
on page 43, paragraph 7C-9:
"Blaine Devon Anderson will
provide said Cheerios! Duty
"at any and all pep rallies,
assemblies, town meetings,
"state fairs, concerts,
television programs,
"motion pictures, video games,
Republican national
conventions..."
I never signed that.
Well, that's funny, because
your signature says you did.
That's a forgery.
And you can't prove that.
I probably could.
Cheerios! Regionals
is fast approaching,
and I need a shiny,
sexually non-threatening gay
to hoist up some
of the most gorgeous girls
in America over his head,
have a bird's-eye view
of their baby oven,
and not be even remotely
interested.
And that would be you.
Thank you, but I'm just
too busy with Glee Club
and Student Council.
If you need me back,
I guess I could do it.
Why are you even here?
You called me out of class.
You're dismissed.
Go find a new boyfriend.
Maybe Lance Bass is available.
Or RuPaul.
Suit up, soldier.
I'll help you put it on.
No, thank you, Becky. I'm-I'm
not rejoining the Cheerios!
Oh, you most certainly are.
Or something very unfortunate
will most likely
be happening to you
extremely soon.
Are you threatening me?
Uh, yeah!
Get moving, beeyatch!
KATIE:
KATIE: French fries are
the world's best food.
KATIE:
Hello, poser.
Say what?
Say what a jerk-knuckle you are
for messing with my girl
and putting that big old
square head in her face.
Marley likes Jake.
And we in Glee Club
like that two-for-one combo.
This is kind of none
of your business.
Did you not notice that I'm
sitting on different sides
of the choir room.
He won't speak to her.
Dude, back off.
Who are you calling a dude?
I am no dude.
So what are you then?
I am a proud black woman.
No, you're a dude.
KATIE: Didn't you tell me it
was Feud Week in Glee Club?
KATIE :
Later, baby.
We need
to do something muscular,
like Biggie versus Tupac.
Now, we know how that ended.
Look, we don't need to do this
stupid assignment, Mr. Shue.
Don't act like you're above
these kids, Finn.
Not that long ago,
you were one of them.
We can just talk.
Unless you have
some stunning new revelation
about why you kissed
my bride-to-be,
I've already heard everything
you have to say.
Besides, I don't think
you could take it.
I can take it.
Okay.
I put you in charge
of the Glee Club, Finn...
not because you were
a national champion
and not because
you were qualified
with something
like a teaching degree,
or even a single college credit,
for that matter.
I gave you the Glee Club
because you were lost;
You just got dumped
by your girlfriend;
You flunked out of the army;
And the real truth is
I just took pity on you.
Wow.
Yeah. You wanted to talk.
Yeah, I did,
but I didn't think...
So I put all this trust in you
so that you can get back
on your feet,
and what do you do?
You betray me
in the worst way possible.
You broke the code
of a brother, Finn.
I know that.
And I'm so sorry.
Sorry's not gonna cut it.
So start thinking of some
of the nastiest music feuds
you can come up with
because we are doing
this assignment.
And I'm gonna kick your ass.
Well, well, well, I see
that of Donkey Face's crap
is still here.
And if Donkey Face's crap
is here,
then that means that
he must be as well.
Lay off of it,
Santana, all right?
I told you, he said
that he got a job
as a cater waiter on the side,
and he was embarrassed about it,
so he kept it a secret.
Why? I mean, if he can
make that much cash
slinging sweaty cold cuts
and room temp champagne,
then we should all apply there.
Hey, look, he's just trying
to make it in New York
the same way that you and I are.
I don't why that is so hard
for you to understand.
You keep trying
to bring him down.
Look, at this point it's less
about him than it is about you.
I went to school
with Rachel Berry.
Not the soggy mess of a woman
that stands before me today,
going back and forth between
your flop high school ex
and that terrifying
"waiter with a pager."
You need to stop
and focus, Berry.
I think you're wrong about him.
My psychic Mexican third eye
is never wrong.
Am I wrong about you?
BRODY:
Oh, so typical
I'm the type
who will get so critical
So let's make
Things physical
I won't treat you
like you're oh, so typical
You!
I know you're behind this.
Sorry I yelled,
Gay Blaine, here.
Oh, Cover Boy hair gel.
This is really expensive.
Thanks, Becky.
It's cement.
And someone took out
and a house loan in my name.
My identity's been stolen.
My parents' credit is ruined.
Only for seven years.
But that sign.
That sign!
Come on.
That's completely inexcusable.
And it's not true.
Not really... this officially
a feud between you and me.
And there's only one way
to solve it.
A sing-off featuring the music
of two feuding superstars?
Oh, I read all about it
in WhoGivesACrap.biz.
Fine. Nicki Minaj
versus Mariah Carey.
I will sing Nicki,
due to my Trinidad roots.
And if you win the challenge,
I'll tear up your
Cheerios! Contract.
Fine, perfect.
But that will never,
ever happen
because you are looking
into the face of...
Evil.
I was going to say
high school cheerleading
national champion,
but thank you.
I don't think it's fair that
you're pissed at me about this.
I didn't do anything.
You let him kiss you.
What was I supposed to do?
It's not like he took
a running start.
You're supposed
to not let him think
that it was even a possibility.
Fine, I'll own that.
I haven't minded the fact
that both of you are into me.
And I certainly
didn't discourage him,
which wasn't fair to him
or to you.
But are you telling me
that you've
completely stopped flirting
with other girls?
I would never do anything.
So if some Cheerio you're
uncontrollably flirting with
suddenly decides to kiss you,
you're just gonna
backflip out of the way
before her lips
touch yours?
So what are we even
talking about here?
Are you seriously worried that
I'm gonna leave you for Ryder?
I don't know.
I mean, he kicked butt
with all this
Valentine's Day stuff
and he's like two inches taller
than what I am.
:
I'm not.
I won't.
I love you
and that means something to me.
It's not just words.
Well, are you afraid that
I'm gonna leave you for someone?
Not as much anymore.
Good.
Because it's me and you
against the world.
Especially Ryder.
I mean, I thought he was
a good dude, but...
he's not a friend.
You need to ice him out.
I can't do that.
I mean, you can stay mad at him
if you want, but I have
to be more forgiving.
How can you do that to me?
It's gonna tick me off
every time I see you
talking to him.
Do you trust me?
Do you believe that I love you?
Yes, but...
Then it doesn't matter
who I talk to.
Because no matter
where I am or what I'm doing,
I'm with you.
I was justified
When I was five
Raising Cain
I spit in your eye
Times are changing
Now the poor get fat
But the fever's
gonna catch you
When the bitch gets back
I'm gonna dress you up in
my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up
in my love
All over your body,
all over your body
Eat meat on a Friday,
that's all right
I even like steak
on a Saturday night
I can bitch the best
at your social dues
I get high in the evening,
sniffing pots of glue
I'm gonna dress you up
in my love
All over, all over
Gonna dress you up
In my love
From your head
down to your toes
I entertain
by picking brains
My love  I sell my soul
By dropping names
You don't like those,
my God
In my love  What's that
Oh, it's full
of nasty habits
When the bitch gets back
Oh, yeah
Gonna dress you up
in my love
Oh, whoa, oh, oh
Dress you up in my love
Gonna dress you up
in my love
In my love
In my love
Gonna dress you up
in my love
The bitch is back
WILL:
Yeah!
Wow, guys, that was incredible.
What inspired that mashup?
I mean, the thing was feuds
so we just...
So Unique demanded mediation.
Might I suggest doing an
Elton John/Madonna mashup?
Madonna finally forgave
Elton John for calling her
"a fairground stripper"
and saying that
her career was over,
but their decade-long
feud was epic.
Unique is, was, and ever
shall be Madonna.
He can try
to be Sir Elton, but...
you ain't got it.
Well, the awesome things
about feuds is
that once all the anger
has gotten out,
you can shake on it and
let bygones be bygones.
Unique would happily shake
Ryder's hand, but first...
say I'm a girl.
Look, I'm just
so confused, okay?
Yesterday you're dressed
as a boy; today you're a girl.
What-what bathroom
do you use?
I mean, make up your mind.
It doesn't matter what you see.
You don't get to decide for me.
You are a douchebag, dude.
I mean, in this room we can
be whatever we want to be.
SUE:
Becky, it's no secret
you are
Nicki Minaj's biggest fan.
Minaj!
Inside voice, Becky.
I need your expert advice.
Now I've got wigs in every shade
of Jell-O,
and costumes
from Lima's Circus Museum,
but if I am going
to win this feud...
and I must win this feud...
I can't just be a mere mirage
of Minaj, no.
I must become her.
Easy, Coach.
Practice your Minaj face.
I think you said,
"Practice your Minaj face."
Excellent.
Great, moving on.
Most important...
I'm one step ahead
of you, Becky.
It's time to perfect my Nicki-
Minaj-where-the-hell-did-that...
come-from-cuckoo-
for-Cocoa-Puffs...
crazy-pants threat.
I'm not putting up
with Your Highness.
It's off with your head.
Don't you call me a gangster.
What?
Every time you patronize me,
I will take it back.
Leave me alone.
I will knock you out.
Getting there, Coach.
BRODY: Five, six,
seven, eight.
Two, four,
six...
Come on, guys, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, please.
This is not gonna cut it
with Cassie, okay?
Let's do it from the top.
Just don't get
too close, girls.
Unless you're immune
to the herps.
Take five.
How did you get in here?
Don't apply logic to Lopez.
And if what I just saw
is any indication,
I can get in here
any time I want.
I've got moves your
mannequin ass couldn't handle.
Do you know what
your problem is, Santana?
You're loud and you're rude,
and you think
that attitude equals talent.
Another thing I am:
A hardcore friend.
Rachel and Kurt are my family,
and I can smell
your sketchiness from here.
So let me tell you
how it's gonna be.
You're gonna move out
of our apartment tonight
or I can dig a little deeper
and destroy you.
You're all talk and no proof.
Don't need proof.
I know exactly what you are.
Yo, fly girls, can
I get some backup?
If you're any kind of dancer,
this one should be
in your bones.
He's a coldhearted snake
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh, girl, don't play
the fool now
You're the one
giving up the love
Any time he needs it
But you turn your back
And then he's off
and running with the crowd
You're the one to sacrifice
Anything to please him
Do you really think he thinks
about you when he's out
He's a coldhearted snake
Girl, look into his eyes
Uh-oh
He's been telling lies
He's a lover boy
At play, girl
He don't play by rules
Oh-oh, uh-oh
Girl, don't play
the fool now
It was only late last night
He was out there sneakin'
Then he called to check that
you were waitin' by the phone
All the world's
a candy store
He's been trick or treatin'
When it comes to true love,
girl, with him
There's no one home
He's a coldhearted snake
Girl, look into his eyes
Uh-oh, he's been
telling lies
He's a lover boy at play
Girl, he don't play by rules
Oh-oh, uh-oh, girl,
don't play the fool now
You can find
somebody better, girl
He's c-cold as ice
As cold as ice
He's cold as ice
He's cold as ice
Stay away from him, girl
C-C-Coldhearted
Ooh, ah, ah
C-C-C-Coldhearted snake
He's a coldhearted snake
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh
He's been telling lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Oh, uh-oh
Girl, don't play the fool,
no
Coldhearted snake
Look into his eyes
Uh-oh
Oh, oh, oh,
he's a coldhearted snake.
Pack your bags.
In the '90s,
the media pitted two
of America's hottest
music groups
against one another
in an epic clash
for pop culture supremacy.
And just so y'all know,
we'll be joining
this performance
because we
are basically Switzerland,
and we support all parties
that are involved.
Thank you.
Whatever. Begin, please.
Hey, hey
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye
Oh, oh
I'm doing this tonight
You're probably
gonna start a fight
So now it's time to leave
And make it alone
I know that
I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I want to see you
out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye
You are
My fire
My one desire
Believe
When I say
I want it that way
Bye, bye, don't want
to be a fool for you
Just another player
in your game for two
It might sound crazy,
but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye
Tell me why
Ain't nothing
but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way
You are
My fire
You are
Don't want to hear you say
Bye, bye, bye  Ain't
nothing but a heartache
Make it tough
Ain't nothing but a...
Ain't no lie, bye, bye
Don't want to be a fool
for you
You are my fire
Just another player in your
game for two
Tell me why
You may hate me
I want it that way
But it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye
Don't really want
to make it tough
I just want to tell you that
I had enough
One desire
Tell me why
It might sound crazy
But it ain't no lie, baby, bye,
bye, bye
I want it that way
Bye, bye.
Well, the love on the stage
is obvious.
You two bros need
to just hug it out.
I'm in.
What do you say, Mr. Shue?
I-I want to, Finn.
I-I really do, I just...
I can't.
Fine. Cool.
There's nothing I can do or say
to win back your trust.
I get it.
For whatever it's worth, thanks.
For everything.
Guess who just got a job
tending bar
at the Coyote Ugly saloon
down on First Street?
Hopefully it bodes better
for me
than any of the has-beens
who starred in that movie.
Santana, if you'd just take
a seat, please
and join us for a little
family loft conversation.
Creepy,
but okay.
We just got off the phone
with Brody.
Did you confront him
at NYADA with a
Paula Abdul song?
You can't just
march on in there
and like, act all crazy, okay?
We go to school there.
That was the best performance
that place has seen in years.
We want you to move out.
You're joking.
We're not.
Olsen twins,
let me tell you something.
I have known you both
for years,
and I don't like either of you
In fact, your wide-eyed,
Keane painting approach of life
makes my teeth hurt
and my breasts ache with rage,
but you know what,
I have love for you.
You're my family,
and I haven't lied to you
in months.
I'm smarter about other people
than the both of you.
You have to trust me.
Santana, you're making Brody
feel uncomfortable, okay?
And he was here first,
so you either lay off of it
or you move out.
Fine.
That's fine.
You know what, I don't...
I don't mind going.
I ran into Lena Dunham
at Barney's,
and she told me
that I could crash with her
if I ever needed to,
so that's cool
'cause she has
two Golden Globes.
Oh, you know what,
and another thing.
I have what
calls street smarts.
I'm right about plastic man.
I'm pretty sure
she just stole my comforter.
Bitch took my pillow.
KATIE:
Pissed off.
KATIE: Well, this Wade/Unique
guy believes he's a girl.
KATIE: Send me another shirtless
pic when you get the chance.
Wow.
Oh
Yeah
Mmm
You look in my eyes
And I get emotional
Inside
I know it's crazy
But you still can touch
My heart
And after all this time
You'd think that I
Wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed
I still believe
That someday you and me
Will find ourselves
In love again
Oh, baby, yeah
Baby, I do
Just give me one more try
In love again.
Oh, yeah
Oh
This one is for the boys
with the booming system
Top down,
AC with the cooling system
When he come up in the club,
he be blazing up
He got stacks on deck
like he saving up
And he ill, he real,
he might got a deal
He pop bottles and he got
the right kind of bill
He cold, he dope,
he might be broke
He always in the air,
but he never fly coach
He a total freaking trip,
trip, sailor of the ship, ship
When he make it drip, drip,
kiss him on the lip, lip
That's the kind of dude
I was looking for
And yes, you'll get slapped
if you looking, ho
I said, "Excuse me,
you're a hell of a guy "
"I mean, my-my-my-my,
you're like pelican fly
"I mean, you're so shy
and I'm loving your tie
You're like slicker than the
guy with the thing on his eye"
Oh, yes, I did, yes, I did
Somebody please tell him
who the hell I is
I am Nicki Minaj,
I mack them dudes up
Back coupes up,
chuck the deuce up
Boy, you got my heartbeat
runnin' away
Beatin' like a drum
and it's coming your way
Can't you hear the boom
Badoom, boom, boom, badoom,
boom bass
That's the super bass,
boom, badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom bass,
that's the super bass
This heartbeat runnin' away
Don't you hear that heartbeat
comin' your way?
Oh, it feel like boom,
badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom bass
I still believe
Can't you hear that boom,
badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom bass?
Don't you know
that I still believe
That someday you and me
Can't you hear
that boom, badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom bass?
Will love again
Boom, badoom, boom,
boom, badoom, boom bass
That's the super bass
I had a dream
That one day you and me
Boom, boom, boom, boom,
badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom bass
Will love again
Boom, badoom, boom,
boom, badoom, boom bass
Yeah,
that's that super bass.
And that, ladies, gays,
and in-betweeners,
and hag for life,
is how it's done.
Impressive, Sue, both of you.
But Coach Sylvester used like,
feathers and a black light,
and she brought in the Cheerios.
Yeah, that's not fair.
Yes, but nobody ever said
life is fair, Tina.
So, William,
though it's shockingly clear
who the winner is,
would you do the honors,
and unlike that interminably
long voting montage
at the end of
let's make this fast.
Show of hands for
Blaine as Mariah.
Thank you, Tina.
Come on.
Noted.
All in favor of Sue as Nicki?
Well, I hope you're ready
for some form-fitting polyester,
gay Clark Kent
from season one of
because it looks like
you're going to be the bottom
of my Cheerios pyramid
after all.
So you really are leaving?
Yeah.
I just wanted to thank you
for everything
you did for me.
Thank you.
So...
what's next for you?
I don't know.
Probably a lot of long hours
of figuring out
what's next for me.
MARLEY:
Um...
Can I speak freely?
Yeah, sure, I'm not your
commanding officer or anything.
Say whatever you want.
Dude, you really need
to grow a pair.
Maybe you should go back
to not speaking so freely.
I know that
you're feeling bad about
yourself right now.
And I also know
how just one kiss
can get you into
a whole lot of trouble.
Believe me.
But if Mr. Shue doesn't want you
around anymore, forget him.
Don't let him define you.
Problem is, he does define me.
The four years I spent
in this Glee Club
defines me.
This whole freakin' school
defines me,
and without it, I am...
I just feel... lost.
So...
After we lost Sectionals, I was
terrified
that everything was
just going to fall apart,
but you fought
to keep us together.
You're a natural leader, Finn.
A teacher.
You don't need
Mr. Shue's approval to be that.
Yeah,
but I do need a little thing
called a teaching degree.
So...
...go get one.
You gonna challenge
all three of us to a feud now?
Look, I asked you guys here
for a truce.
Okay, sometimes
I don't know how to fit in here.
But kissing you, Marley...
that was so out of line,
and I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It's not, but...
I'll never do it again.
Look, friendship is about trust.
Okay? It's like
when we're playing football.
Look, I fumbled
the ball this time,
but you know I have good hands.
I just made a mistake.
You know
if you give me the ball again,
I won't let you down.
Yeah, but it might take
a little while.
I take that.
Thank you.
Unique...
Look, I'm not gonna pretend
like I understand everything
that's going on with you.
But you have a truth,
and as your friend,
I need to support
that truth, so...
you're a girl, dude.
Holy crap, did I mess that up?
No, it's just...
That day, after we sang...
I decided to walk home
in all my Leslie Uggams glory,
GIRL 1: ...serious?
Look at this.
Are you a boy or a girl?
Hey! Freak!
Lady Freak!
I got home before
they caught up to me,
but I was so scared.
I'm walking you home
from now on.
Yeah. Me, too.
Me, three. KITTY: Me, four.
And P.S., do those bitches
go to this school?
'Cause if so,
I want their names
so I can put Nair
in their shampoo bottles.
Wait a minute. We're friends?
Look,
I don't know if it's 'cause
I've been dating Puckerman,
which makes it really hard
to judge anyone...
and I will deny it
outside in the real world...
but, yes.
We're friends.
And we're in this together.
I'm a winner,
and I want to win Regionals.
So we need to cut the crap
and the fighting
and tighten up
so we can win this.
Friendships are tested
like this all the time.
And the ones that are real
are the ones
that pass the test.
Artie and Tina and Sam
and probably Brittany
are all going to be gone
next year,
and it's going to be up to us
to keep up the Glee Club torch.
Not just winning
competitions, but...
the legacy of being
the only place at this school...
at any school...
where the most special thing
you can be is yourself.
Think we're up for it?
Are you kidding?
This place ain't seen
nothing yet.
Yeah!
Oh, yeah...
SUE:
You look absolutely
adorable.
And just to show there's
no animosity between us,
I've decided to make
you and Becky
my Cheerios!
Co-captains.
Yes!
I love you.
Thank you.
Let this be a life
lesson to you...
one that you'll remember
when you're playing
"Uncle Nubbins"
on
reboot...
that the real world is nothing
like the Glee Club,
where you can join and rejoin,
quit and requit
whenever you're not crying
or throwing confetti
at each other.
Because in the real world,
there are commitments...
and you're only as good
as your word.
Blaine Devon Anderson,
do I have your word
that you are
fully committed to my team?
What? She can't hear you!
Yes, Coach Sylvester.
All right.
Gymnasium, 3:05.
Oh, a little trick
of the trade...
from now on, wear a thong
to avoid visible panty lines.
How'd it go?
Exactly as planned.
I'm gonna work from the inside
and bring her down.
By the time we graduate,
Sue Sylvester's reign of terror
will finally be over.
Excellent!
Good evening, Vicky.
Santana. How did you...
I told you.
This is what I do.
You can't tell Rachel.
Please, I'm not proud of this.
Save it.
I think there's someone
more important
that you should convince
tonight.
Okay.
Well, I am going
to leave you two alone
for a little girl talk.
Have fun.
Listen, I can explain this.
Shut your mouth.
After tonight...
you're a ghost.
You disappear
from her life forever.
No good-byes, nothing.
I love her.
But she doesn't really even know
who you are.
Yet.
You can't tell her.
Ah!
Ah!
Stay away from my future wife!
All I want to get is...
A little bit closer
All I want to know is
Can you come
a little closer?
Here comes the breath
Before we get
A little bit closer
Here comes the rush
Before we touch
Come a little closer
The lights are off
And the sun is
finally setting
The night sky
is changing overhead
It's not just all physical
I'm the type
who will get oh, so critical
So let's make things
physical
I won't treat you like
You're oh, so typical
I want you close
I want you
I won't treat you
like you're typical
I want you close
I want you
I won't treat you
like you're typical
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Here come the dreams
of you and me
Here come the dreams
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Here come the dreams
of you and me
Here come the dreams...
It's not just all physical
I'm the type
who will get oh, so critical
So let's make things
physical
I won't treat you
like you're oh, so typical
I want you close
I want you
I won't treat you
like you're typical
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh...

Treat you

All I want to get is
Doo doo doo-doo
A little bit closer
Doo doo doo
All I want to know is
Can
you come a little closer?
Doo doo doo.
KATIE: So you apologized
to all of them?
KATIE: What about Marley? Are
you still crushing on her?
