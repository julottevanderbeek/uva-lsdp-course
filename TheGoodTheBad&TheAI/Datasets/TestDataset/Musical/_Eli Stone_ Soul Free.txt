in about an hour from now
there's gonna
be an earthquake.
oh my god!
it's like i see things now
things that were always there
but that i just never noticed before
your dad told me
that i would make good
on my debt to him one day.
i didn't know what
your dad meant.
i recommend that patients should
get their affairs in order.
i should draft a will?
before i go in
for my surgery...
you want us to witness
your suicide note?
it's a statement about
how and under what
circumstances i
don't wanna live.
c.b.p.   holding.
b.p. 100 over 70.
that's good.
the graft is secure.
i'm preparing to
tie off the aneurysm.
oxygen--head is
good.respiration's normal.
pulse is dropping.
damn it.it ruptured.
he's hemorrhaging.
he's in defib.
reclip proximally.
-quickly,people,now!
-pressure's dropping.
let's run in
some more volume.
more suction.
thanks. re.
so you got that,
thing this week,right?
if by "the thing" you mean
getting my skull sawed open,
then,yeah,that's friday.
well,listen,if,uh,anyone
deserves to... not... die,
or... be
brain-damaged,it's you.
and look on the
bright side--
if you do end up a vegetable,two
words-- sponge... bath.
thanks.
that's comforting.
keith.
we need to talk about
the allen depo,right?
actually,i was
looking for eli.
great.   i'll be in my office.
everything okay with mosely?
aside from still
being in prison?
he's good.   i
saw him last week.
but,uh,i wanted to talk to you
about something else,though.
i thought they
fixed that already.
look,i know this is
a big week for you--
hey,is there anyone
in this office
who doesn't want to talk
about my neurosurgery?
look,i appreciate your
concern,but i'm gonna be fine.
did they have an
aftershock or something?
i must have slept through it.
okay,i-i get it.
you don't want
to talk about it.
but if you change your
mind,or you just want to
go out and get
hammered,drinks are on me.
thanks.
take care of yourself,man.
any idea why
people in the office
are treating me like
i'm made of glass?
um,i couldn't say.
you should get
ready for your 10:00.
patti,you don't have to
threaten people to be nice to me.
well,what else do
you want me to do,eli?
people don't get brain
surgery every day.
treat me like you always do.
in fact,i demand that you
are meaner to me than usual.
where's the mayor of
sasstown when i need her?
can we just act like
everything's normal?
your 10:00 is here.
i didn't realize
i had a 10:00.
that's because
you don't   listen.
see?   see?
that's the spirit.
sorry.   hi.   are you patti?
so nice to meet you
in person,mr.   green.
meet eli stone.   he's
been expecting you.
yes,i have.
could you just remind
me what this is about?
i need you to help me die.
assisted suicide is
illegal in california.
i'm not interested
in suicide,mr. stone,
assisted or otherwise.
my wife wants me
declared incompetent.
she wants to
take away my right
to make my own
medical decisions.
so,uh,a-are you ill?
cancer.
it started in my
colon,but it spread.
i've been through
chemotherapy twice.
both times i went
into remission,
and both times the
cancer came back.
my wife wants me to
have chemo again...
but i won't do it.
you don't want to
go through it again?
no.
god told me to be at peace.
and in my experience,chemotherapy
is not peace.
you spoke to god?
yeah.
i... prayed,and i
told him what happened,
and it just
came to me--
n-not a voice,exactly,but
a feeling.
when it comes to
chemotherapy,for me,
it told me-- or he...
she...   told me--
third time's not the crm.
obviously,i'm not a
doctor,so i guessing...
without the
chemotherapy--
i'll die,probably...
or maybe not.
i-i-i just
prayed,and god told me
to put myself in his hands.
and my wife
doesn't want me to.
will you help me stop her?
-have you completely lost your mind?
-original.
in three months,i
haven't heard that once.
sorry,but sane people
don't predict earthquakes,
and they definitely
don't sign d.n.r.s
-right before high-risk
neurosurgery.  -why not?
because postsurgical
outcomes can be unpredictable.
for someone like you--
you can come out with
a horrible prognosis
and six weeks later
be totally fine.
so even if i come
out a vegetable,
yeah,well,if you want to
get technical about it.
or i could stay a
vegetable,or in a coma.
that's why i need a d.n.r.
just because the surgery
is risky doesn't mean
you should put your life in
some random doctor's hands.
i'm not.   i'm
putting it in yours.
you want me to be
your health care proxy?
are we gonna go back
to the "crazy" jokes?
no,you've lost your
mind for real this time.
what is so insane
about asking my brother,
who also happens
to be a doctor,
to be my health care proxy?
nothing,except
the last two people
your brother did that
for happened to die.
valerie masters
refused the heart.
you said so yourself.
she made a decision.
yeah,but dad didn't.
look,i-i know my limits.
ten years ago,i
made a bad decision,
-and i'm not doing it again.
-you won't.
-you don't know that.
-yes,i do.
nathan,you've been right
about everything so far--
the aneurysm,dr.   rajapaksa.
whatever happens,i trust you.
and if i don't trust myself?
that's the beauty of it.
you don't have to.
what matters most is that i
believe you'll do the right thing.
and by "right thing," you
mean if things get bad,
if worse comes to
worst,you want me to...
i want you to let me go.
dr. stone?
dr. rajapaksa
wants to see you.
it's about your brother.

so i heard about
your case... and,
well,i was thinkg my
schedule's pretty free.
i could second chair.
uh,that's okay,maggie.
i can handle it alone.
well,no,of course,you can.
i wasn't implying that...
you even know what
the case is about?
-not really.
-i had a feeling.
so what are you
really doing here?
nothing.   nothing at all.
i just-- i owe
you for last week,
for saving scott...
for everything.
you're trying to get
in on the dying guy case
with the other dying
guy before both guys
get flushed down the
proverbial toilet.
yes.   no.   wait.   what?
you're afraid i'm gonna die.
no,i'm not.   i'm not.
in fact,i would really,really
prefer it if you didn't.
it's just... this
operation,it's... it's dangerous.
really dangerous.
so maybe i am a little scared.
i mean,aren't you?
truthfully?
living or dying-- either
of those is fine with me.
it's the something in
between that scares me.
but for the record,dying is
not really on my agenda,so...
okay,you can second chair,but
no sniffling.   okay.   thanks.
no one wants to die,but
i'm going to,rebecca.
i just choose to
die on my own terms.
but we choose life,david.
that's what we do.
moses' last words to the
israelites--"choose life."
she called it "the 11th
commandment" in one of her sermons.
my wife's a rabbi.   did
i forget to mention that?
yes,actually,you did.
but that explains the
talking to god part.
jews haven't talked to
god since the biblical age,
and in any case,you'd have to
first believe that god exists.
david doesn't.
-that's not true,rebecca.
-fine.
he doesn't believe god exists
except during basell season.
as it turns out,i was diagnosed
during baseball season.
i'm hardly the first person to
find faith in times of crisis.
that's a large part of
what faith is for,isn't it?
we're not questioning
your belief in god,
just your belief
that god spoke to you.
i prayed,and i got answers.
how does that make
me less competent
than millions of other people?
because the answers you got
advised you to
abandon your children.
they advised me to
die with dignity.
and if that's god's plan,
i can't imagine a greater
lesson to teach my children.
they don't need lessons.
they need their father,as
long as possible.
where have you been?
i've been calling and calling.
why?   has something happened?
there's nothing that
makes me crazier than
you not answering your
cell phone when i call,
and i know you
were in the car.
well,i must have
had it on vibrate.
well,how hard is it
to turn your ringer on?
do i have to follow
you around telling you,
"ring,ring,eli,somebody's
calling,"
when the person
that's calling is   me?
-okay!   i'll turn my ringer on!
-good.
and... your mama
dresses you funny.
oh,the mean thing.
i'd forgotten how
good you are at that.
jordan wants
to see you--
probably some new
stupid thing you did.
now get outta here!   i can't
stand lookin' in your face.
thanks,patti.
well,don't just stand there.
there he is.   go.   go!
eli.   walk with me.
sir,i know i said i wouldn't
take any new cases before friday--
it's not about the case.
as w.p.k.'s former and
current managing partner--
speaking of which,i
know i congratulated you
a couple of days ago,but i'm
having this weird d¡§
j?vu-ey
kind of day,so in case i
didn't,congratulations again.
may i continue?
when you walked into my
office eight years ago,
you know what i saw?
a strapping young lawyer
with a full head of hair?
a greedy,self-righteous
little sycophant.
an ass.
i am flattered,sir.
but as i got to know
you,i saw you were more.
you were driven,competitive,and
when i found out
you were dating my daughter,going
to be my son-in-law,
i couldn't have been happier.
you were the man to follow
in my footsteps,to take w.p.k.
to the prestigious
heights i had dreamed of.
i put you on the fast
track for partner.
-but then you got an aneurysm
-and i changed,i know.
is this little
walk and talk about
how much i've
disappointed you?
sometimes... you
are still an ass.
what--what's
going on?
ladies and gentlemen,i present
to you the junior partner
in charge of pro
bono initiatives--
mr. eli stone.
all right!
me?   what?   oh,my god.
kudos,man.   you deserve this.
eli,we're so proud of you.
you mean so much
to everyone here.
couldn't have happen
to a better guy.
except me,of course.
eli,i'm so happy
for you.       oh!
wait.   i-i know
what's going on here.
sir,um,being partner means more
to me than you'll ever know,
but if you're doing this
because you think i'm gonna die
or as an
incentive to live--
eli,you have it all wrong.
i made you partner because
your compassion changed me.
please... wake up.
and how would you describe
david's religious beliefs?
david was born jewish,but he
never had any faith to speak of.
he always said if i
hadn't been so pretty,
he would have married shiksa.
so when-- when david said
that god had spoken to him...
well,at first i
thought it was a joke.
now i'm convinced it's just
a symptom of his depression.
depression?
when the colon cancer progressed,when
david didn't respond to
the new chemotherapy,he...
he grew more and more
despondent,hopeless.
he claims to have found
new faith and hope.
well,if that was the case,he
wouldn't be giving up.
he'd fight to live,to-- to
see our children grow up,
for as long as he can.
thank you.
the god of the jewish faith.
judaism teaches that god instilled
in us the gift of learning.
human beings have learned to
expand the horizons of science
and medicine to create
treatments,however brutal or dangerous,
which can fight disease,which
can save our lives.
that's why i believe
god wants david to live--
because he created
a world in which
there is a chance for
my husband to survive.
i just want him to take
that chance... for me...
and for his children...
and for himself.
that's why i married her.
she's great under
pressure,isn't she?
she's very convincing.
are you having second
thoughts about helping me?
what exactly did
god say to you?
how did it happen?
did--did you,did you see
someone or i... hear a song,or...
i can't explain.
it's not like i
heard a voice,exactly.
it's--it's
more like a...
a moment of... clarity.
and i felt calm.
i had peace.
that never happened to me.
and you know,it's never happened
to rebecca,and she's a rabbi.
want your office back?
a partner should have a big,private
office that isn't a library.
who knew that,uh,imminent death
could be so upwardly mobile?
you know i couldn't be
more proud of you,right?
well,that means a lot...
especially 'cause
you're one of the people
i trampled on on my
ruthless climb to the top.
i've been wanting to
tell you something.
i suppose now is as
good a time as any.
you're the most important
person in my life.
i thought it was carlo,the
guy that colors your hair.
i'm serious,eli.
you taught me about love...
and not just the
romantic kind,
but the all-encompassing
lifetime kind...
the kind that sustains
through tragedy and... triumph.
-through breakups...
-and brain surgery?
taylor...
i'm gonna do my
darndest not to die.
listen to me.
you're not dead,all right?
you're not dead.
list to me.
i said i'd be there
for you no matter what,
eli,and i meant it.
taylor?
-hey.
-good to see you.
you,too.
-are you hangin' in there?
-me?   yeah,i'm,
i'm fine.
they were almost
done with the surgery,
just about to
clip the aneurysm.
thought he was
out of the woods,
and then there
was a hemorrhage.
then another.
the artery walls were
weakened due to pressure
from the aneurysm,and the
surgery just made things worse.
eli went into cardiac
arrest,and the heart attack
cut off blood
flow to his brain.
and the aneurysm?
it's gone.
but...
you know,in an
alternate universe,
eli and i would be
married now,and...
i'be the one having to
make the decision to...
-the decision.
-eli already made his decision.
he... he didn't
want toive this way.
nate,it's easy to say that
when it's a hypothetical,
but when the worst
actually happens...
just because eli asked
you to let him go...
-it doesn't mean you have to honor his request.
-no.
i've already let him
down,and i can't do it again.
i just...
i can't.
everything's going my way.
i made partner--junior
partner.
they had a cake for
me-- uh,red velvet.
congratulations.
it's what i've been
working toward for years,
and now i have it.
i earned it.
it--it's
just...
"for what shall it profit
a man if he shall..."
regain the corner ofce
and lose his own soul?
mark 8:36,from your
new favorite book.
i have a new client.
he's dying of cancer.
he says that god spoke to him.
did he use a musical number?
no.   he just...
took away his burdens.
he feels like this great
weight has been lifted from him.
makes me think.
-what has god done for you lately?
-well,yeah.
this guy-- he grants
inner peace and me,
he just tries to
scare the crap out of.
maybe god's showing
you his love by
scaring the crap out of you.
so this is spiritual
corporal punishment?
why are you looking
at me like that?
back on the commune,which
is supposed to be
a place of harmony and
connection to nature,
i never felt close to god.
that's why when i
went out on my own,
i immersed myself in
the study of religion--
all religions,so
that i could find him.
funny thing is,all those
years of seeking him out,
and he goes and finds me
when he sent a smug,stubborn,
pain-in-the-rear lawyer
right up to my door.
now you're doing it,too.
why is everyone talking
to me like i'm gonna...
-nathan?
-can i help you?
actually,i'm here to
help you... help eli.
maybe you could
say that again.
i had a dream about eli.
part of him is alive.
he's still in there,
-and i think he's trying to get a message out.
-a message?
through a dream to
his acupuncturist?
to his friend,to
someone who might be
more open to these messages.
if it happened to you,you'd
think it was just a dream.
well,it happened to
you,and i still think it.
no offense.
he doesn't know the surgery
happened yet,dr. stone,
but he's close.
two weeks ago,i would
have called you a quack
and sent you on
your way,but now...
eli told
you things--
things about your past that
he had no way of knowing.
and then he put me in
charge of his d.n.r.
even comatose,he's a tool.
but today i'm supposed to
take him off of life support.
and i think i'm supposed
to convince you otherwise.
i want to listen.
more than anything,i
want to believe that
if i just wait long
enough,eli will wake up.
then why don't you?
because i can't.
because i know he's not okay,
and he is not
going to get better.
medical science
isn't everything.
if you've listened to
anything eli had to say,
you'd know that by now.
then... it's not
about what i know.
it's about what eli wants,
and he was very,very specific.
and if i start to
substitute my nee for his,
then i'm... yeah.
it's like i'm betraying him.
we're not betraying him,nate.
this is my dad.
with me.
i worked for him.
no chance you
photoshopped this?
i can barely check my e-mail.
nate,years ago,your father
foresaw me helping eli,
and finally,i-i think
this is my chance to.
give him more time.
i'll wait 48 hours.
-but if eli doesn't wake up
-he will.
then i'll do my best
to believe in that,too.
"be at peace"?
that was god's message to you?
it's so simple.
i guess that's
why it's divine.
so chemo could extend
your life or even save it.
why wouldn't you want that?
is your wife right?
are you depressed?
no.
in fact,in some ways i'm
happier than i've ever been.
this is how i want to
spend my remaining days,
and isn't it my
choice to make?
thank you,david.
what did god sound
like,mr.   green?
well,i-i didn't hear a voice.
well,if you didn't
hear a voice,
how can you be so
sure it was god?
a feeling came over me,and i
can't describe that feeling,
that serenity,as anything
other than divine.
and before that,you
were despondent?
yeah.
what about the first
time the chemo worked?
elated.   why?
what's your point?
well,one minute you're up,the
next minute you're down.
is there a question
in our future?
well,i'm just wondering
if this serenity isn't
just the latest
peak on the rid-
that your overloaded brain
created a moment of clarity
so that you'd just let
go,against all scientific evidence
that chemotherapy,sir,can,in
fact,save your life.
you know,there's a
scientific explanation
for the burning bush?
dry local fauna under
a volcanic fissure,
but none of us
were there,rebecca.
none of us know.
how can you know
it wasn't divine?
let me enjoy my last
moments on this earth
with you and the children.
i'm going to lose.
mrs. green,um,you
really shouldn't be here.
i'd--i could get sanctioned
for talking to you ex parte.
well,i won't
tell if you won't.
rabbi's honor.
look,i know i can't
convince a judge
to substitute david's
judgment for my judgment.
then... why put
david through this?
because i do think i
need to convince david.
i need to convince
him to keep fighting,
and i need your help.
rabbi,he's made his decision.
i know you,mr.   stone.
i know all about you.
what do you know?
you're sick.
you're fighting for
your life just as
my husband should
be fighting for his.
i know about the earthquake.
i know about all of it.
mostly,i know you are
more than just a lawyer,
and i ow david chose
you for a reason,
and i believe that
reason is for you
to show him that
difficulties can be overcome,
that fighting for
your life is worth it.
the jewish tradition teaches
that to save one life...
is to save the entire world.
you have within you the
power to save a life.
i beg of you... use it.
i think we can win this case.
i think i can get the
judge to stop rebecca
from forcing you
to take the chemo.
well,that's great news,but
apparently,not to you.
rebecca came to see me.
i thought that was
against the rules.
well... she's a rabbi.
we talked.
and the thing is,david,i...
i think she's right.
i think you should
want to live...
and not just for her or for
the kids,but for yourself.
aren't you supposed
to be on my side,eli?
rebecca,the doctors,and now
you're trying to convince me?
i'm not like them.
i'm--i'm-- i'm
more like you.
i... i believe that
god spoke to you.
i just think that
you heard him wrong.
he sent you a doctor.
he sent you a rabbi.
and now he sent me.
a doctor,a rabbi,a lawyer--
sounds like the start of a joke.
i think that god wants
you to fight for your life.
i am.
i'm fighting... for
the life i have now.
you know,you never asked me what
my life was like before cancer.
well,i had everything.
i had a great job.
i had a great car.
i drove home every
night to a great house
with a great
wife and kids--
except i never saw my family.
i was always at work.
you know why i-i never went to
rebecca's services at the synagogue?
because i got home so
late every friday night,
that saturday mornings i was
too exhausted to get out of bed.
was i a skeptic?   yeah.
but who could blame me that...
that life had no meaning?
-it...
-sounds familiar.
i was sleepwalking.
don't you see,eli,that
if i never got sick...
i'd still be asleep?
i have a full life now.
and it's a life i
never thought i'd have.
and i owe it... to
that moment with god.
i have a purpose now.
this case is not about god.
the mere fact that david green has
embraced death to such an extreme,
over the pleas of
his wife and children,
is evidence itself that he is not
competent to make this decision.
rabbi green,her
children and his doctors
have been unable to
force this man to do
the right thing,but
this court can.
and it shod.
rabbi green thinks
that there is no way
david could have
spoken to god.
well,there's no way
to prove that he did.
but there's no way to
prove that he didn't,either.
counsel asked david to tell us
what god sounded like.   why?
i think if we have
faith,we believe
thagod speaks to us
each in different ways.
a few months ago,i started
hearing and seeing things
that indicated the
presence of god in my life.
i tried to follow what
i thought god wanted,
and i paid the price.
looking back,i think it's
been the best time of my life.
david had a feeling.
i saw... george michael.
is that crazy?
if it inspires us to change
our lives for the better,
then i hope--i pray...
we're all crazy.
david wants to live
the rest of his life
in a way that brings
him closer to god.
that may not be what
we would choose for him,
but it's not our choice
to make.   it's his.
-taylor?
-dad,hi.
-we should get going.
-yeah.   yes.   um,just give me a sec,okay?
you're crying.   yeah.
i'm sorry.   i know
you hate crying.
honey,i don't hate crying.
okay,i hate it.
but these are
difficult--
i understand.
not exactly how i
thought it would go
when i started working here.
-do you regret it? working here?
-no. no.
it hasn't been easy.
for what it's worth,i realize
a lot of that's been my fault.
i take it from your
silence you agree with me.
it's okay,dad.
you're just being you...
mr.difficult.
i want you to know i'm trying
to not be myself anymore.
if eli was...
if eli was here...
i was gonna make
him a partner.
i'm starting a
pro bono practice.
i'm changing.
the firm is changing.
i want you to be an
integral part of that.
please,honey,stick with me.
i need you here.
how could i not?
in ruling on mr.
green's competence,
i am not unaware
that a verdict
in his favor may well
sign his death certificate.
mr. dupler used mr. green's
alleged conversation with god
as evidence that he
is mentally unstable.
mr. stone warned us against
calling faith a form of insanity.
but in the eyes of the law,
mr. green's faith is
irrelevant to this case.
i must consider his
decision to not pursue
a course of treatment that
will make him temporarily sicker
but which will not guarantee
him a permanent cure.
from that perspective,mr. green's
decision is perfectly rational.
the law respects a dying
man's wishes to keep on living
by whatever definition
of living he chooses.
the motion to have david green
declared incompetent is hereby deni.
-congratulations.
-thank you for giving me my life back.
-get the crash cart.
-no.   it's all right.
this is what he wanted.
good-bye,my love.
something's not right.
i... i've been
wearing the same suit
and the same shirt
and tie for days.
i don't ever
remember going home
or how i've been getting
from place to place.
it's like i'm somewhere,and
then i'm someplace else.
and making partner...
and the case being
about living or dying...
the way everyone's
treating me...
-it's like...
-it's like what,eli?
i already had the
rgery,didn't i?
it went bad...
like in the vision.
sorry,bro.
am i... did i shove off?
does it matter?
what the hell kind
of question is that?
i don't want to be dead!
then don't be.
it means what it means.
would you just stop being
annoying and enigmatic?
i don't know what to tell you.
i'm not really here.
neither are
you,for that matter.
it's kind of trippy,isn't it?
no one blames you,eli.
no one's angry.
they're sad...
and they'll hurt.
they'll hurt for a long time.
but the world will
go on without you,eli.
the world doesn't
need eli stone.
unless...
unless?
i have...
you can say
it,eli.   it's okay.
i'm sure it's nice
for him to hear.
i have more to do?
i-i have more to do.
i think so,too.
how do i get out of here?
do i,uh,take a red
pill or,you know,
get scotty to beam me up or...
how about riding the needle?
does acupuncture work if
it's technically imaginary?
you listen to
figment dr.   chen!
yeah.
thank you.
for what?
you're talking to yourself.
i'll miss you most
of all,scarecrow.
that was lame,dude.
hello?
is anyone there?
george.
what are you...
oh,man.
are you god?
well,some men have said so.
i don't know how to get back.
sure,you do.
you've always known.
i have?
