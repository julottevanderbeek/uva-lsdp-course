Cab fare, Richard?
No, I've got to pay some bills.
Well, at least leave me
enough for breakfast.
Why, toddy,
one would suspect you
think I'm mercenary.
Try unscrupulous.
You get your money's worth.
I'd say we both get
my money's worth.
Look, toddy, if you're not happy
with the arrangement...
as a matter of record, I'm not,
but to quote the immortal bard,
"love looks not with the eyes
"but with the mind.
Therefore is winged
cupid painted blind."
Have a nice day, toddy.
I'll do my damnedest.
All the year where
cherries grow
All the year where
Cherries grow
Cherry ripe, cherry ripe,
ripe, I cry
Full and fair ones
come and buy
Cherry ripe
Ripe, I cry
Full and fair ones
Come
And
Buy
As you can tell,
monsieur Labisse,
I have a legitimate voice.
Yes. Well,
you see, I'm looking
for something a little
more illegitimate.
Oh, I'm sure that
with a little practice...
lady, that is like a nun
saying with a little practice,
she could become a streetwalker.
It has to come naturally.
Right.
In some professions,
practice is a minor
consideration,
so take my advice
and stick to Carmen.
I am a coloratura,
monsieur Labisse,
not a mezzo.
Well, whatever you are,
Andre Cassell should never
have sent you over here.
He didn't.
You told me he was your agent.
I lied.
Thank you.
And in spite of what you think,
monsieur Labisse,
there are some professions
where practice
does make perfect.
Aaahhhh
What in hell was that?
B-flat.
Monsieur Directeur,
she's back.
What?!
Hey!
Miss Grant.
You, uh...
you owe me two weeks.
H-h-hold... hold it.
What?
You promise to
pay me on Tuesday,
then on Wednesday,
then on Thursday.
What's that?
What?
Spaghetti?
Yes.
With meatballs.
I'll sleep with you
for a meatball.
You what?
Mr. Jansen.
Oh, no, you don't.
It won't do you any good.
I've been in the hotel business
for 20 years.
I know All the angles.
Come on.
Get up. Get up.
I don't care if you've
got the bubonic plague.
If you can't pay your rent,
I confiscate your
personal belongings,
and I evict you.
What happened?
You made a certain offer to me
which I could not refuse,
and then you pretended to faint.
Don't be ridiculous.
I never pretend to faint.
Yes, sure.
What are you doing?
I am, uh, helping
you to stand up.
That's funny, I thought
I was standing.
Maybe you'd like to lie down.
You're confusing me.
I'm sure we can do something
about the rent.
Whatever you may think,
I'm not an ungenerous man.
Aah!
Aah!
What is it?
There!
Where?
There!
A cockroach!
Oh! Oh!
Why, you...
I'm sorry. Aah!
I can't stand cockroaches.
Especially in a hotel room, eh?
Anywhere!
Yeah! You won't tell
the department of health
if I forget your rent, uh?
I tell you once more,
I'm getting my money.
And, uh, just in case
you thought
of leaving us
during the night...
oh, please don't leave me.
Please!
Oh!
Oh!
I know what it is.
I'm dreaming.
When people speak
of gay Paree
They think that when
they say Paree is gay
They mean that
gay Paree is gay
It is.
Not in the way Paree was gay
in yesterday Paree
It means today
that gay Paree is gay
Not that gay.
They say Paree
has always been
That way
Along the banks of the seine
Just take a walk
now and then
You'll meet
some interesting men
Gay Paree
Along the rue Madeleine
each evening round about 10
You'll see it time
and time again, gay Paree
If you've a soiree to spare
Go to the Folies Bergere
You'll see such gaiety there
C'est la vie
Around
the rue Des beaux-arts
Where All the cabaret
shows are
I mean, well, really
those are, You'll agree
What they mean when they say
Gay
Paree
That's toddy
warbling again.
The faubourg St. Honore
Where All
the millionaires play
Oh! There you are.
Is also, I'm so glad to say,
gay Paree
The rue De rivoli arcades
Where fancy goods
are displayed
There's also bound to be
rough trade, gay Paree
And in arrondissement 8
The champs Elysees
I would rate
Perhaps the one thing
that's straight as can be
Hey, waiter!
And at the cafe De la Paix
If you are heading that way
They drink a toast
every day around 3
They make each moment as gay
as Le quatorze De Juillet
That's what they mean
Oh, boy!
When they say
Gay Paree
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
You're most kind.
In fact, you're every kind.
I see we have a celebrity
with us tonight.
Miss Simone Kallisto,
star of stage, screen,
and an occasional circus.
Take a bow, darling.
Up yours, Cheri.
And speaking of the circus,
aren't you Richard Denardo,
the well-known trapeze artist?
Careful, toddy.
You're not really
funny, you know,
so why don't you just piss off?
You! You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.
Bringing your sweet, old mother
into a place like this.
Gyaaah!
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,
you have a delightful
surprise coming to you...
no!
No!
Please.
Monsieur.
Thank you.
But nobody was seriously hurt.
That's why I'm only
closing you for a week.
You know how much
I will lose in one week?
A quarter of what
You'll lose in a month
if there is any more trouble.
You're fired!
I can't afford it.
You can't afford it?
What about me?
What about All this?
More ice.
You take it out of my salary.
Toddy, get out!
All right.
And don't come back!
If you ever set foot
in this place again,
I will have you thrown out!
Don't make it sound
like such a threat.
Being thrown out of this place
is significantly better
than being thrown out
of a leper colony.
Out!
Thank you.
Something to drink?
Ah, could I see your wine list?
We have a white 1934,
we have a red 1934.
Last week we had some rose,
but we're using it in the salad.
Which do you recommend?
The red is 6 centimes cheaper.
I'll have the white.
I bet you are a Rockefeller.
Is something wrong?
I thought maybe you had a dog.
Dog?
I've only been gone 5 minutes.
I figured something
helped you eat it.
It was delicious.
Do you want a salad?
Later.
Later.
The chicken was so good,
I thought I might try the pork.
Does it take long?
About, uh, half an hour.
What about
the Boeuf Bourguignonne?
That's ready.
I'll have that, and I'll
have the salad afterwards.
You realize, of course,
you're entitled to two salads.
Could you put them
both on one plate?
That's possible.
Terrific.
Delicious wine.
Maybe you'd like to
choose your 2 desserts.
Apple flan and coupe Jacques
might go well together.
Just a small coffee.
Good evening.
I had the pleasure
of hearing you sing
this afternoon.
Oh, you must be mistaken.
I... i haven't sung
in about two weeks.
Your audition at Chez lui.
Oh. That was not singing,
and I would hardly
call it an audition.
Ha ha ha. I used
to work there.
My condolences.
Well, I hope I
haven't bothered you.
I just wanted to tell you
that I think you
have a lovely voice,
and to say how sorry I am
that I can't buy you dinner.
Thank you.
Oops.
Pardon me, monsieur.
Oh, thank you.
Could I have a knife
and fork, please?
Excuse me.
Why are you sorry that
you can't buy me dinner?
Casse.
Broke?
I'm also Carroll Todd...
toddy to nearly
everybody who knows me.
Victoria...
Grant.
I hope we meet again
when I'm flush.
Won't you sit down?
Please?
Have dinner with me.
Thank you.
You know, it's very strange.
At the club, I thought you were
just about at the end
of your rope.
I was. I am.
This is the first
decent meal I've had
in almost four days.
And you can't pay for it.
Casse.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
And you want me to
have dinner with you.
I want you
to have the best damn
dinner you ever had.
Have two.
I started off with
the roast chicken,
and I segued to
the Boeuf Bourguignonne.
It's anybody's guess
what I could end up with.
Oh, I'd guess about 30 days.
If All goes well,
I expect to leave
here poor but sated.
I have a...
Bug in my purse.
At the appropriate moment,
it goes in my salad.
It'll never work.
A bug in my salad?
In a place like this,
it would be an event
if there wasn't
a bug in your salad.
What about a...
Cockroach?
A cockroach?
Shh!
Bigger than your thumb.
Oh, god!
Waiter.
Try the chicken.
I really recommend it.
Um, the Bourguignonne
was just a little tough.
Maybe the way you're eating,
your jaws are getting tired.
Speaking of overworked jaws,
why don't you treat yours
to a sabbatical
and fetch me a wine list?
This is All they have.
This? Last time I saw
a specimen like this,
they had to shoot the horse.
How lucky can you get?
In one evening, a Rockefeller
and a Groucho Marx.
They didn't shoot a real horse.
Just a costume
with two waiters in it.
I shall think of a sharp retort
while I'm getting
your roast chicken.
It's a wise man who knows
when to throw in the towel.
And it is a moron
who gives advice
to a horse's ass.
Ha ha ha ha!
I made the dressing myself
with the last of the rose.
I'll bet it's delicious.
I wouldn't bet on it.
Go on, try it.
I think I'll wait till
the Bourguignonne
settle a bit.
You don't have to eat it.
Oh, I want to.
You will be the first to know.
You'd better go now.
I want to lend my support.
Oh, that's lovely.
But it's my cockroach
in my purse,
and I have to get it
into my salad.
I'm perfectly willing
to take over your salad.
You can just slip me
the purse under the table.
Listen, you hate cockroaches
as much as I do,
what if I manage and you faint?
Then it's possible
I shall wake up in prison.
Then I can't talk you out of it?
You don't have time.
Careful it doesn't crawl out.
Anybody looking?
Nope.
I don't see it.
How's the salad?
Aah!
Have you tried it yet?
No.
No. I was, um,
just about to.
We would like another
bottle of wine.
We'd like to try the red.
Aah!
Co-co-cockroach.
A cockroach?
In my sa-sa-salad.
I can't believe it.
I don't believe it.
Are you impugning
this lady's integrity?
She's impugning my salad.
Oh, no, no, no.
I-I-I'm sure
it wasn't your fault
your salad had
a cockroach in it.
It didn't, and it wasn't.
I demand to see the manager.
Yes, sir.
This lady found
a cockroach in her salad.
So I gather.
Well, what are you
going to do about it?
I'm going to apologize.
Madame, I regret that you found
a cockroach in your salad.
I can assure you
that in the five years
I've been running
this restaurant,
there have only been
two other occasions
when customers complained
of having found insects
in their food.
You see?
It's happened before.
On both occasions,
it turned out that the customers
had actually put the
insects in their food,
hoping to blackmail
the restaurant
and thus avoid having
to pay their checks.
Uh-huh.
Surely you're not suggesting...
that madame is trying
to avoid paying her check?
Well, of course not,
and as a manager
of this restaurant,
I hope madame accepts my apology
for any inconvenience
she may have been caused.
Thank you.
Ma... madame does.
Now, that is what I
have done about it.
What are you going
to do about it?
I?
There is still the matter
of your check.
My check?
There was no cockroach
in your salad.
No, no.
I invited this man
to have dinner with me.
Oh, I see.
Am I to gather, madame,
that since this
gentleman is your guest,
you don't feel
that you should pay
for his dinner, either?
I would say that
under the circumstances
that's the only
logical conclusion available.
I will tell you what
I consider to be
the only logical
conclusion available.
Either you or madame
will pay the entire...
aah!
This way!
What?!
What?!
I was
the leading soprano
of the bath touring
light opera company.
Very athletic
for a soprano.
That's because I
have three brothers.
Hmm, I know what you mean.
I grew up with
two older sisters.
Bless you.
Thank you.
I think I'm catching a cold.
Do you have any bicarbonate?
Top shelf.
I have the worst heartburn.
Can I ask you a question?
You want to know
if I'm a homosexual?
No.
I want to know if
you're a hypochondriac.
Ha ha ha!
Not necessarily.
Oh.
Oh. Well,
my husband was.
The day we got married,
he got the shingles,
and when we got divorced,
his ulcer perforated.
How long have you been
a homosexual?
How long have you
been a soprano?
Since I was 12.
I was a late bloomer.
What happened
to the bath touring
light opera company?
I guess you could say
Lou cassava took French
leave with the bankroll.
Lou cassava?
Our stage manager.
Sam put him up to it.
Sam?
My ex-husband.
Oh, god.
You know,
you should stay in bed
and force liquids.
That's good advice for a camel.
You have anybody
to take care of you?
Oh, it's only a cold.
A cold tonight
could be pneumonia
by the morning.
Are you sure your husband
was a hypochondriac
before he married you?
I know you think
that I'm an alarmist.
Only because you sound like one.
I've had enough
personal experience
to know that when it
comes to your health,
it does not pay to take chances.
Then you can stop worrying.
With the exception of
saxophone lessons and the Metro,
I never pay to take anything.
You know what I'm going to do?
What?
I'm going to see if
my clothes are dry,
and then I'm going to try
to sneak back into my hotel.
What if I wake up
with pneumonia?
Well, I'll just have to come
round early in the morning
and check on you.
I could have a relapse
in the middle of the night.
No, you couldn't.
Why couldn't I?
Because the middle of the night
was about two hours ago.
Hiyum
Da dum
la da Dee Dee Dee
Dee Dee Dee Dee
Oh, my god!
What?
Oh!
What? What? What?
Aww...
It was guaranteed not to shrink!
My best dress. Look!
Let's see.
Oh, there's nothing to let down.
I can't go out like this!
Well, what about the coat?
Oh!
What am I going to do?
Sell matches.
Aw, poor baby.
I'm sorry.
This hasn't been my day.
God, there have been times
I'd have given my soul
to be able to cry like that.
Oh, I hate it.
You wouldn't if you
couldn't do it anymore.
Well.
Now...
Tomorrow, I'll go over
and pick up your clothes.
Oh, they won't let you.
They will if I pay your bill.
You can't do that.
Why not? This
is that rainy day
I've saved up a few francs for.
Here.
You know what they say.
What?
"Neither a borrower
nor a lender be."
"For a loan oft loses
both itself and friend."
Exactly.
You were willing to compromise
your virtue for a meatball.
Well, I was out of my mind
at the time,
and at least it was
something for something.
All right.
We'll make this strictly
a business proposition.
I'll charge you
a weekly interest
equivalent to the going
rate of one meatball.
Oh, damn.
Toddy...
You're sweet and generous.
Exhausted.
How would I ever pay you back?
Well, we'll solve that tomorrow.
In the meantime,
I'm giving the orders.
You are going to get into
those pajamas and come to bed.
There?
You're welcome to the sofa,
but you have my word of honor
this is much more comfortable
and infinitely safer.
Oh, god.
There's nothing
more inconvenient
than an old queen
with a head cold.
I won't be long.
I resent being treated
like a helpless invalid!
Oh, will you
keep your mouth shut?
Now, I'll cash the check,
pay my hotel bill,
and be back in time
to fix lunch.
I can bloody well
fix my own lunch.
Not with a fever, you can't.
What makes you so sure
I've got a fever?
Because you're burning up,
that's why.
I'm naturally
warm-blooded.
To be that naturally
warm-blooded,
you'd have to be
a Saint Bernard.
You look better in Richard's
clothes than he does.
Of course, he looks
better out of them.
Well?
You're right,
you don't have a fever.
In fact, you don't even
have a temperature!
Now, leave it there.
Does Richard have a hat?
In the closet.
Toddy?
Richard!
Good morning, Richard.
You look like a raccoon.
I came by to pick up my things.
I thought it was
to pay me the money
you owed me.
I don't owe you a thing,
you pathetic old queer.
Unh! Ah!
You bastard!
Get up!
You get back in bed!
Now...
Next time,
pick on someone your own size.
Ooh!
And don't come back!
Good.
God, my nose.
What happened?
There was a man
wearing my clothes.
I think he broke my nose!
Toddy, you're delirious.
Lower your voice.
Toddy...
lower.
Toddy.
Caruso, not Chaliapin.
If you don't get back
into that bed...
good! When you're angry,
it drops naturally.
Think angry.
Oh, my...
oh, god!
What an inspiration!
I'm going to get a doctor.
Victoria, it will work!
Oh, toddy, it will not.
If you listen to me
and do exactly as I say,
in six weeks You'll be
the toast of Paris,
and we will both be very rich.
Oh...
Very, very,
very rich.
But, oh, my god.
Think! No more bath
light opera company.
Well, of cour...
no more mikado and seedy tenors.
Yes, but...
caviar instead of meatballs!
Where are you going?
To get some scissors!
People believe what they see,
and this afternoon,
Andre Cassell is going to meet
Europe's greatest
female impersonator.
Andre Cassell
is the biggest agent in Paris.
If I'm the greatest,
why hasn't he heard of me?
You're the greatest,
but you're unknown,
except in Poland.
Poland?
You're count Grazinsky,
Polish aristocrat,
and you speak
very little English.
Your family disowned you
when they discovered
you were gay.
Oh, now, wait a minute.
We met in Warsaw, fell in love,
and I brought you to Paris.
Ah, hold it!
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
What's right?
A woman pretending to be a man
pretending to be a woman?
Ridiculous.
It's preposterous!
In fact, it's so preposterous,
no one would ever believe it.
And yet, you expect them
to believe count...
What's his name?
Grazinsky.
Grazinsky, a gay Polish
female impersonator?
Darling, All anyone
has to believe
is that you're a man.
To convince an audience
that an illusion is real,
the magician creates
a plausible diversion.
Count Grazinsky is
our plausible diversion.
Toddy, no audience
is that gullible.
They'll know he's a phony.
Right.
Well?
They'll know he's a phony.
Toddy, I don't know
how to act like a man.
Contrary to
the popular conception
of how a man acts,
there are All sorts of men
who act in All sorts of ways.
I mean, as opposed
to the way women act.
I am personally acquainted
with at least a dozen men
who act exactly like women
and vice versa.
There are just some things
that are naturally masculine!
Name one.
Um... Um...
Peeing standing up.
Ha ha. on the other hand,
there's absolutely no rule
that says a man can't sit down.
Men have Adam's apples.
So do some women.
Name one.
Nana Lanoux.
What?
Taxi!
Nana Lanoux?
Who's she?
The last woman I slept with.
When was that?
The night before the morning I
decided to become a homosexual.
Very dashing.
I can't wear this All the time.
Why not? It might
set a fashion.
Did miss Lanoux
have a big Adam's apple?
Like a coconut!
Good morning.
Would you please tell
Mr. Cassell
that Carroll Todd is here?
Why?
Why?
If you don't have an appointment
with Mr. Cassell,
why should I tell him
you're here?
Because Mr. Cassell and I
are very close friends,
and if you tell him I'm here,
he'll want to see me.
That's not very
complicated, is it?
Being a very close friend,
I'm surprised you don't know
that every Wednesday
at this time,
Mr. Cassell
has his hair cut,
and he never sees anyone,
including his
very close friends.
We'll wait.
You're wasting your time.
Oh, no.
You are wasting it.
Mr. Cassell.
No. Miss Selma.
No, I mean I wish
to see Mr. Cassell.
No.
I am Leclou,
the world's greatest
equilibrist.
On Wednesdays,
Mr. Cassell
only sees Giannini,
the world's greatest barber.
Very well, then.
If Mr. Cassell
cannot see me,
then I shall perform...
For you.
What are you doing?
Get off!
Will you get off?
Get off that desk!
Will you get off?
Oh!
Hello, Andre.
Toddy, what the devil...
Andre, I think
it's very important
that you meet count
Victor Grazinsky.
Who the hell is
count Victor Grazinsky?
Surely, you're
joking. The count
is Europe's greatest
female impersonator.
I've never heard of him.
And in All modesty,
if I haven't heard of him,
he can hardly be Europe's
greatest anything.
Count, would you demonstrate?
Certainly.
aaaaahhh
Eeeaaugh!
What the hell?
Count, with your voice
and my connections,
you're going to get rich,
and I'm going to get richer.
To a long and profitable
relationship.
Now, when can you open?
Where?
Here?
Here?
Here?
Six weeks.
Excellent.
Here.
...they knew it
It was whizzin'
round the world
The world was ready
for a new kind of music
And now
they play it
From
steamboat Springs
To la Paz
'Bout 20 years
ago, way down...
Try a tone lower.
O.K., uh...
'bout 20 years
ago...
No. Try a third.
A third?
Uh-huh.
All right.
'Bout 20 years
ago...
Perfect.
That's just low enough
to be a touch masculine.
Now, when you're
dancing, remember...
make it broader,
with tons of shoulder.
Remember, you're a drag queen!
When you play me
Le jazz hot, baby
You're holding my soul
together
Don't know whether
it's morning or night...
He's fantastic.
He's a phony.
What do you mean?
If he's a Polish count,
I'm Greta Garbo.
Well, Greta, whatever he is,
I think he's divine.
'Cause I love
my jazz hot
Whoo!
Oh, god, I'll never make it.
Now listen to me.
From the beginning,
we've had two major
obstacles to overcome.
My bosom.
First, to convince everyone
that you're a man.
Now, so far, we've done that.
It's been damned uncomfortable.
What has?
Strapping down my bosom.
Now All you've got to do
is get out there
and show them what a great
entertainer you are,
and You'll be a star
for the next 20 years.
Toddy, if I have to
strap down my bosom
for the next 20 years,
they're going to end up
looking like two empty wallets.
Sit up.
Then what?
Stand up.
Oh, sit up, stand up, throw up.
Now, you are not
going to be sick!
Not if I faint first.
We've got a full house.
I sent out 300 invitations,
and everyone's turned up
except king Marchand.
Who's king Marchand?
Well, among other things,
he happens to be
the most successful night
club owner in Chicago.
And the other things?
Oh, nothing worth mentioning,
if you want to stay alive.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the night club
is proud to present
the one and only Victoria!
'Bout 20 years ago
Way down in New Orleans
A group of fellas
found a new kind of music
And they decided
to call it
Jazz
No other sound has
what this music has
Before they knew it
It was whizzin'
round the world
The world was ready
for a blue kind of music
And now they play it
From steamboat Springs
to la Paz
Oh, baby,
won't you play me
Le jazz hot maybe?
And don't ever
let it end
I tell you, friend
It's really something
to hear
I can't sit still
When there's
that rhythm near me
Also, baby
Le jazz hot may be
What's holding my soul
together
Don't know whether
it's morning or night
Only know
it's soundin' right
So, come on in
and play me
Le jazz hot, baby
'Cause I love my jazz
Hot!
before they knew it
It was whizzin'
round the world
The world was ready
for a new kind of music
And now they play it
From steamboat Springs
to la Paz
She's a winner.
When you play me
Le jazz hot, baby
You're holding my soul
together
Don't know whether
it's morning or night
Only know
it's soundin' right
So, come on in
and play me
Le jazz hot, baby
'Cause I love
my jazz hot
Le
Jazz
Hoooottt
Le jazz hot!
Bravo!
Bravo!
Bravo!
Brava.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Bravo!
Bravo!
Ha ha ha ha!
Watch this.
It's a guy!
Yay!
Yay!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Yay!
Excuse me.
Pardon us.
Pardon me. Pardon me.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Come on, dear.
I hope six, eight weeks,
something like that.
Hi.
Hello.
Oh, I'm Norma Cassady.
You were just grand.
Thank you.
Oh, and, uh,
this is king Marchand.
How do you do?
How do you do?
I've got to admit
for a while there,
I was really cheesed off.
King's tongue
was hanging out a foot.
Then, you know when you
took that wig off,
I just couldn't believe it!
King still doesn't.
I'm flattered.
I'm delighted you could make it,
Mr. Marchand.
Oh, thank you.
May I introduce
Mr. Todd?
It's a pleasure.
How do you do?
This is miss Cassady.
Mademoiselle.
Enchanted.
Oh! Me, too.
Well, what do you
think of our new star?
He thinks he's a phony.
Oh, I think she's very talented.
But he doesn't think
you're a man.
I'll tell her what I think.
"Her." See?
Norma...
What?
Mingle.
Oh. Sure.
Care to, um...
Care to mingle
with me, Mr. Todd?
Miss Cassady,
excluding Victor's performance,
mingling with you
may well turn out to be
the highlight of the evening.
I just love Frenchmen!
Oh, so do I.
I'll get you a drink.
Well, thank you.
You were saying,
Mr. Marchand?
Well, I...
I just find it hard to believe
that you're a man.
Because you found me
attractive as a woman?
Yes, as a matter of fact.
It happens frequently.
Not to me.
It just proves the old adage...
there's a first time
for everything.
I don't think so.
But you're not 100% sure.
Practically.
Ah, but to a man like you...
someone who believes
he could never
under any circumstances
find another man attractive,
the margin between
practically and for sure
must be as wide
as the Grand Canyon.
If you were a man,
I'd knock your block off.
And prove that you're a man.
That's a woman's argument.
Your problem,
Mr. Marchand,
is that you're preoccupied
with stereotypes.
I think it's as simple as...
you're one kind of man,
I'm another.
And what kind are you?
One that doesn't
have to prove it
to myself...
Or anyone.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
I...You're kidding!
You... you really
are queer?
Oh! We prefer gay.
Oh, but you're so...
Attractive.
Well, I just think
it's a terrible waste.
You know what I think?
What?
I think that the right woman
could reform you.
You know, I think
the right woman
could reform you, too.
Oh! Me give up men?
Forget it!
You took the words
right out of my mouth.
Norma?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I still think
it's a terrible waste.
Well, if it's any consolation,
I assure you it is not wasted.
Oh!
Norma.
What? Jeez...
Au revoir.
Me, too.
Come on. Get out
of my way. Go on.
See you in church.
Oh...
Don't ever leave me alone
like that again.
What did you think
of king Marchand?
King Marchand is
an arrogant, opinionated,
chauvinistic pain in the ass.
I think I could fall
in love with him.
I think I could, too.
I'm tellin' ya, he's gay.
I know All about it.
We had a long talk.
They met in Poland or something,
and he brought him to Paris,
and he's making him a big star.
They're lovers.
And I know why you
don't want to believe it.
Ha!
Can I give you a lift
to your hotel?
That's kind of you, but...
we'd be delighted.
Hotel?
Why not?
I heard you, Norma.
I heard you.
I just don't know what
you're so burned up about.
Thank you.
I mean, it was a perfectly
natural mistake.
Knock it off, Norma.
Well, squash thought
he was a woman.
If you think about it,
it's really very funny.
He isn't bad-looking,
but I knew he was
a man right away.
It's the padding.
I don't care how clever
those costumes are.
I mean, there are just
some things you cannot fake.
I mean even with All
those hormone shots
and everything, a real
woman can always tell.
Can you imagine
what Sal Andretti would say
if he knew his partner fell
for a female
impersonator? Huh?
Check under the bed?
Yes.
Now...
I know he's supposed
to protect you,
but does he have to stay
in the same suite with us?
I mean, I just keep
expecting him to break in
while we're, uh,
we're making love.
He'd only do that if he
heard something unusual,
like if I got excited.
Well, you...
You big jerk...
listen to me, you creep.
You mind your own business...
Good evening, sir.
Good evening.
Thank you, Andre.
Good night, toddy.
Victor, get some sleep.
Toddy, this is the Marceau.
Hm-hmm.
Where are you going?
Up.
Entrez!
That's far enough.
Toddy, what are you up to?
Toddy?
Ta-da!
Ahh...
Holy Merde.
Toddy, when did we move?
During dress rehearsal.
But what if I'd flopped?
Ooh, then, we would have
ordered a sumptuous meal,
charged it to room service,
drunk the champagne...
compliments of the management...
and jumped out the window.
Which is why I chose
a three-star hotel
and specifically
requested accommodations
above the third floor.
Monsieur.
Oh, toddy.
Oh, the bathroom is
a religious experience.
I can hardly wait.
Ohh... When can we afford
another bedroom?
As soon as we're sure you're
not just a flash in the pan.
My god!
Besides, one bedroom, one bed,
promotes the illusion
that we're lovers.
If for some reason
we decide we'd
rather sleep apart,
there's more than enough room
for one of us in the bathtub.
Yeah. And if we have
an overnight guest,
he can always stretch out
in the bidet.
Right.
I love you.
I love you, too, sir.
Ohh... Ahh!
Mm-hmm...
Ahh...
Da-da da dah
Hey!
Aren't you coming to bed?
King...
Pookie...
Yoo-hoo.
I'm horny.
Oh! Ohh!
O.K. All right.
Oh, give me a home
Where the buffalo roam
And the deer
and the antelope...
Are gay
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word
Obviously a music lover.
I dare you to hit high "c".
Well, I will if you will.
If I could, I would be the star,
and you would still be trying
to swap your virtue
for a meatball.
Speaking of virtue...
yecch.
Were you serious
about king Marchand?
Were you?
I asked you first.
That's an infantile evasion.
O.K.
I find him extremely attractive.
Check.
In fact, I wouldn't mind
having an affair with him.
I'll buy that.
You know...
Pretending to be a man
has its disadvantages.
My dear count...
You just said
a cottonpickin' mouthful.
Pookie...
It's no big deal.
It happens to everyone.
Men, I mean.
We're lucky.
Women, I mean.
We can fake it if we have to.
Oh! Oh, don't
get me wrong.
I never have with you.
Faked it, I mean.
With you,
it's... it's like
pow! Pow! Pow!
Like the fourth of July.
Every time.
Just tonight,
because you couldn't get it...
up till now, it's been grand.
Pookie, really, really grand.
And if there's one thing
I know for sure,
you can't let it get you...
you should excuse
the expression...
down.
You can't think about it.
You just got to
put it out of your mind.
I mean, the more
you think about it,
the more you worry.
The more you worry,
the more you think.
Think, worry...
umm... It's soft.
Worry, think...
It's... it just gets like
a vicious cycle.
And then, before you know it,
you are impudent.
What's with the soap?
Arghh!
Aah!
Look out!
You son of a bitch!
Now, Norma...
No! Nobody puts soap
in my mouth!
Not even...
not even my mother!
You're being very childish.
I'm going to kill him.
I'm going to kill you, too.
You big, musclebound...
Ooh!
Listen, you have to learn
to control yourself.
Aah! Ooh! Gahh!
Oh, shit!
Aah!
This is it!
Let me... Aah!
You and your ideas.
"Why don't you take her
to Paris with you, boss?"
I just thought
she'd help you relax.
She'd never help me relax.
Well, then, send her home.
Why don't you ever come up
with a really good idea?
For instance?
You send her home.
He thinks he can
just push me around.
Thinks I'm just going to hop
on the next boat for the states
and that'll be that.
Well, you've got
another think coming,
Mr. big shot
fairy Marchand,
'cause Mrs. Cassady's
little girl Norma
ain't gonna take
this one lying down.
Ooh!
And don't kid yourself!
You ain't seen
the last of me yet!
Aah!
Are you O.K.?
La la la la

There was once a shady dame
from Seville
Used to wander round the town
dressed to kill
And men, if they dared
Stood and stared
when she passed their way
The lady knocked them out
There's no doubt,
'cause they'd shout
Ole!
All day
Seville isn't that much
to shout about
But when she was out
Traffic stood still
Dressed like a vamp
Or a Pamplona tramp
She could stampede
the menfolk at will
Aiee!
Ole!
One day came
a world-famous matador
Rat-tat at her door
Bearing a rose
If he distressed her
Disturbing her siesta
It's best to say
nobody knows
The rest of the tale's
not a pretty one
Pity one isn't for sale
Only two ears and a tail
Did they find by the blind
on her sill
No one knows what became
Of the shady dame

Ah, ah-ah,

The shady dame
From Seville
Ole!
Ole!
Do you believe this weather?
I thought we left Chicago.
Would you see
that count Grazinsky
gets this, please?
Yes, sir.
Count Grazinsky.
Yes, sir. 432.
Right.
Oh, hi, Norma!
Oh!
That's really funny.
Good night, squash.
Good night, boss.
Give me the housekeeper, please.
I thought you were going to bed.
I think I'm having
an anxiety attack.
Oh, you, uh, better
get some sleep.
I may want to get up
in the morning
and play some golf.
Boss, it's snowing outside.
We'll use red balls.
Yes. Uh, this is
mister, uh...
King Marchand.
Mr. Todd in suite 432.
Would you be kind
enough to have a maid
bring up some extra
towels, please?
Oui, monsieur.
Thank you so much.
Monsieur?
Hmm.
Bonsoir.
Bonsoir, monsieur Todd.
C'est pour Le Comte.
Merci.
The concierge gave me this,
but there's nothing on it.
Hmm.
Oh, mustn't forget.
Important photography
session in the morning.
What's funny?
Watch the birdie!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ahh...
Oh ho ho!
Oh, I don't think I've been
this tired in my whole life.
Oh, you're still a young man.
But not for long.
All I want is a nice, hot bath.
Oh, I had one once.
You'll love it!
Won't you play me
That jazz hot, baby?
Toddy...
Sorry
Oh, give me a home
Where the buffalo roam
Where the deer
and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard
Ya da da da dum dum
Ohh... I know
this is ridiculous,
I don't think I'm going
to be able to sleep,
I'm so tired.
I'll get you a cognac.
That'll help me sleep?
No, but it makes staying awake
a hell of a lot more fun.
And the deer and
the antelope are gay
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word
Mmm...
Here. Guaranteed to
lift your spirits
and warm your cockles.
That's my trouble.
I don't have any cockles.
Ha ha ha.
You hungry?
No, thanks.
I'm too tired.
What the...
What?
Who is this?
Ohh, I could sleep for a week.
What?
I can't understand you.
What?
What room did you want?
Who?
No, I am not
señor Gomez from Barcelona.
And unless he's hiding
under my bed,
you have the wrong room.
What the hell...
Phew!
Why did you open the window?
Hmm?
Forget it.
Go to sleep.
It's freezing.
Yeah. Small wonder.
Oh, damn.
Hmm?
I left the light on
in the other room.
Hmm.
What?
You got the floor All wet.
Hmm.
Bitch, bitch, bitch.
Do you have heat in your room?
Yeah.
Boy, you're lucky.
Trendy travelers
tend to talk
Of London
Paris
Rome, New York
Like only they were stylish
and unique
But out in the Midwest
Is the city
I love the best
A town so smart
Its spelling starts
with c-h-i-c
Chic!
Chicago, Illinois
Is like a shiny toy
The prairie state
is proud to state
That it's its pride
and joy
The windy city
sweeps you clean off your feet
Oh!
Its charm is complete
Wow! They're knocking you flat
this way and that
On every downtown street
Aah!
The white sox and the cubs
And All
the sporting clubs
Make living here
a pretty nifty ploy
Smack on the lake,
this is a rare port
Someday, they'll say
We'll have
an airport!
Yeah!
When they say
"Hey, I'm from chi"
They mean
Chicago, Il-la...
Nois!

Oh!
Oh!
Hi, Sal.
Thanks for coming by.
Norma, what's on your mind?
It-t-t-t's...
It-t-t-t's...
King!
Shacking up with another dame.
No. Another guy.
Oh, it's so terrible.
I just...
Run that by me again.
Well, there's this
Polish fairy, you see?
Even when I was
a second-rate soprano,
I had a proper dresser.
You had a proper dresser
who could swear that you were
a second-rate
soprano,
and not a first-class
impostor.
You trust my dressmaker.
And he trusts me not
to reveal certain things
that would be very embarrassing
to his wife and six children.
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself.
Shame is an unhappy emotion
invented by pietists
in order to exploit
the human race.
Who said that?
I said that.
You don't believe in shame?
I believe in happiness.
Comrades.
King Marchand has
just offered me a fortune
for you to appear at his club.
Would you please
be more specific
with your nouns?
$10,000 a week.
That's not a noun.
That's a fortune.
He wants to have dinner
with you after the show.
You think you could make it?
Oh, I think so.
I'll tell him.
$10,000 a week,
We are on our way.
I know what
you're thinking
And you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.
To the count's opening
night in Chicago.
To the closing night,
may it never come.
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question,
Mr. Marchand?
He will whether you mind or not.
I worry more about
answers than questions.
It's rather obvious
that Mr. Bernstein
is on hand to ensure
your continued good health.
That's not a question.
Uh-huh.
Why is he sitting
way over there?
Strategic.
Ah. Broader
field of vision,
clearer field of fire.
You must have been in the army.
Once or twice.
Do you mind if I join him?
He looks so lonely.
No, I don't mind.
I promise not to inhibit
his field of fire.
Incorrigible.
How long have you
known Mr. Todd?
Oh, a long time.
May I ask you
a personal question?
A clever man once said,
"it's not the questions
I'm worried about."
What's the attraction?
Would you believe me
if I told you we were in love?
No.
Because homosexuality
is unnatural and a sin?
According to whom?
Oh, pious clergymen
and terrified heterosexuals.
Oh, them.
You're smiling,
and I don't believe you.
And you're not smiling,
and you should be.
I think I'd better
go wash my hands.
Excuse me.
Do you ever get
the feeling sometimes
that you're a sinking ship?
Constantly.
Ah, now, there.
You're smiling.
You light up when you smile.
That's a funny thing to say.
How do you mean?
I mean, one man to another.
Seems toddy
and Mr. Bernstein
have found something in common.
Yeah, uh...
Cassell was
telling me that, uh...
Mr. Todd was the headliner
at Chez lui.
You know Chez lui?
No, but I was thinking
that, uh, we might
drop by later,
and you could educate me.
I have the feeling
that educating you
would be about as redundant
as teaching a lion
to like red meat.
Cigar?
May I?
Mmm, please.
Thank you.
Regarde. C'est Victor!
Ah, toddy!
What a pleasure.
Come this way, please.
Regarde.
C'est Victor!
I have a table for you.
The best, of course.
This is a delight.
Ah, Victor!
Please, a bottle of champagne.
Thank you.
Take this bottle
over to that table.
Those are very special guests.
Encore!
Encore!
My friends...
My friends, tonight
I am happy and honored
to have with us one
of the great entertainers
of our time...
the toast of Paris...
Victor!
Perhaps Victor...
Perhaps Victor will honor us
with a song.
Give us a "g" with
your left hand, Sid.
You
And me
We're the kind
of people
Other people
Would like to be
Wanderin' free
We present
the kind of picture
People are glad
to see
Something I've wanted
in All my life.
And we don't care
That tomorrow
comes with
No guarantee
We've each other
For company
And come what may
You and me,
we'll stay together
Me Harmony.
Year after year
Won't we, my dear?
We'll always
be you and me
Walk this way.
Taught him everything he knows.
That's why he has
so little left.
Oh, I'll get you for that.
You
And me
Yadada
Very difficult step.
Oh, such a fuss!
Oh, yeah.
This way, please.
Wanderin' free
Sorry about that.
That was fun, now what do we do?
You got us into this.
You get us out.
May I?
I'd be delighted.
Tomorrow comes with
No guarantee
You're leading again.
Oh, I'm sorry!
We've each other
For company
And come what may
This is the place!
We had to come here?
Don't argue with me.
Shut up! Shh!
Shush yourself!
Waiter!
What are we supposed
to do, just stand here?
Didn't you reserve a table?
Shh! Shh!
Of course I reserved a table!
Let's sit down.
Please! Victor!
I don't care if it's
Noel frigging coward!
This way. This way.
This way.
...me
Aah!
My god!
You rotten bastard!
You get away from him!
Aah! Take your
hands off me!
Aah!
No!
You?
Ah!
Everybody, this is
a respectable place!
Oh!
My...
I'm so sorry!
So am I!
No, please! Stop!
Aaaaah!
Cockroach!
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
Ahh.
Ugh!
Halt! Halt!
Ha ha ha!
I don't care if you are a man.
I'm...
Not a man.
I still don't care.
Cockroach!
Cockroach!
I've never seen you
before in my life.
Ohh! Ohh!
Aah! Aah!
Oh, my god.
I'm s...
I thought...
I'm really sorry.
Honestly, I'm...
I'm sorry.
Squash?
Squash?
Hey, squash, look,
I know what you're thinking.
No, you don't.
In one fell swoop,
you've changed my whole life.
It wasn't that kind of swoop.
Listen, boss...
If a guy like you
has got the guts
to admit he's gay...
So can I.
You've made me so happy.
Ha! You know, I...
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing, nothing.
I'm finding this trip to Paris
a little more...
Bizarre than usual.
Ohh...
Thanks a lot.
Oh, oh, not you. No.
It's not you.
Why not me?
I mean, a woman pretending
to be a man pretending...
you can stop pretending.
And do what?
Be yourself.
And what's that?
What do you mean?
You're a woman
in love with a man.
Yes.
Are we communicating?
You said a woman
in love with a man,
but you didn't finish.
O.K.,
what's the finish?
A woman in love with a man,
pretending to be a man...
I said you can stop pretending.
But you see,
I don't think I want to.
I'm a big star now.
I'm a success.
Oh, that.
And something more.
I find it All
really fascinating.
I mean, there are things
available to me as a man
that I could
never have as a woman.
I'm emancipated.
Emancipated?
Well, I'm my own man,
so to speak.
Oh, you should be able
to relate to that.
Well, to be honest with you,
right now, I'm having
a little trouble
relating to anything.
Look, if we're to have
any kind of future together,
it's important
that you understand.
I want to understand.
Well, you think it would be
fair for me to ask you
to give up your job?
It would be ridiculous.
But you expect me
to give up mine.
There's a difference,
for Christ's sake.
Right, but there shouldn't be.
Look, I'm not the one
pretending to be someone else.
Let's put the shoe
on the other foot.
Let's say that you're a man,
and I'm a woman
pretending to be a man.
Well, I think it
would depend a whole lot
on why you were pretending.
Oh, come on now,
Victoria, you said
it's important
that I understand.
It's important that
you understand, too.
Certainly.
Love is
a two-way street.
Why did I say that?
I don't know,
but what's your point?
Uh, you said if we
were going to have
any kind of future,
what do you mean by future?
Live together?
Possibly.
Sleep together?
Hopefully.
While you keep on working?
Yes.
Pretending to be a man.
If I didn't,
I wouldn't have a job.
Uh-huh.
While we're living
and sleeping together,
what's everybody going to think?
I guess they're going to
think that you're living
and sleeping with a man.
How do you feel about that?
Well, they're going to think
the same thing about me.
But you're a woman!
Yeah, but they don't know that.
You do!
And you know you're a man!
I don't see the difference.
We'd be living a damn lie.
I don't think
that's what's really
bothering you.
If you think I'm worried
about everybody
thinking I'm a fag,
you're right.
So we have a problem.
I guess we have.
Well, it's probably
for the best.
That's as bad
as "love is
a two-way street."
What it lacks in originality,
it makes up for in prophecy.
Sooner or later,
I'd probably ask you
to stop being a gangster
because I was worried
about everyone thinking
I was your moll.
I am not a gangster.
Just a businessman
with a bodyguard.
A businessman
who does business with gangsters
and doesn't have a bodyguard
is soon out of business.
A businessman who does
business with gangsters
and pretends he's not a gangster
sounds a lot like
the kind of act I do.
I think we're both pretenders,
and that's not a very good basis
for a relationship.
Oh, but it was fun
while it lasted.
Have a nice evening?
Up to a point.
What happened to you?
Oh, nothing much.
We were All arrested.
Andre called his lawyer,
who bailed us out.
You remember
Mr. Bernstein.
Count Grazinsky.
Mr. Bernstein.
Hey, squash, can I ask you
a personal question?
Go ahead.
How long... i mean...
Exactly when did you
know about, uh...
When did I know I was gay?
Yeah.
God, I can't remember
when I wasn't.
I've known you for 15 years.
You knew a lot of guys, boss.
You'd be surprised.
You were
an All-American.
I never saw a meaner, rougher,
tougher, son-of-a-bitch
football player
in All my life.
Listen, if you didn't
want the guys
to call you queer,
you became a rough, tough,
son-of-a-bitchin'
football player.
Why don't you watch
where you're going, huh?
He says it was your fault
and, uh, suggests
that you apologize.
Oh, he does.
Come on.
No, no, no, no.
Well, you tell him
if he'd like an apology,
he can just get him some gloves,
and I'll see him in the ring.
Just give him 10 minutes.
He will be delighted to oblige.
Oh, he will, huh?
He'd be delighted to oblige.
Who the hell does
he think he is?
Guy Langois,
the French middleweight
boxing champion.
But don't worry.
He's gay.
The shady dame
From Seville
Ole!
Ole!
Mr. Bernstein.
Count.
I think we should
try living together.
Your place or mine?
Monsieur Labisse?
Yes?
You called.
I am Charles Bovin,
private investigator.
Good.
There is something
I want you to find out for me.
At your service.
Be careful.
Monsieur, I'm always careful.
That stool is broken.
It is?
Penny.
Oh, nothing.
Ah, a lot of things, I guess.
I want to make a deal.
Hmm?
No secrets,
no grudge collecting.
If something bothers us,
we say so, O.K.?
O.K.
And we don't plan past tomorrow.
Just...
Take it a day at a time.
Deal.
Crazy world
Full of crazy contradictions
like a child
First you drive me wild
And then you win my heart
with your wicked art
One minute tender
Gentle
Then temperamental
as a summer storm
Just when I believe
your heart's getting warmer
You're cold,
and you're cruel
And I, like a fool,
try to cope
Try to hang on
To hope
Crazy world
Every day, the same old
roller coaster ride
But I've got my pride
I won't give in
Even though
I know I'll never win
Oh, how I love this
Crazy world
Bravo!
Bravo, Victor!
Ha ha ha!
He's got a good right hand,
and he doesn't use it!
Oh, there's the right!
There's the right.
I told you!
He's got him.
Hook him! Hook him!
Hook him! Hook him!
Ah, go get him!
All right, All right!
He's got him!
Is something wrong?
Oh, we've had
dinner in the hotel
every night for a week now.
Well, when we go out
after the show,
you're usually so tired,
you spend the next day sleeping.
This way, we go to bed
reasonably early,
and we can spend a few
afternoons together.
Do you know what I'd
really love to do?
What?
Skip a few afternoons
and go dancing.
Dancing?
Let's go.
Take her back to the hotel.
I'll see you later.
Hey, boss...
just do what
I tell you, O.K.?
I'll be All right, go on.
I just wanted to go dancing.
Yeah, well, I guess if two guys
wanted to go dancing together,
that'd be a little unorthodox
at the Ritz.
I guess the problem is,
we're not really two guys.
Yeah, I guess
that is the problem.
Stop, driver. Back up.
Milk.
Cow's milk, monsieur,
or mother's milk?
How about your sister's?
Oh, shit.
You're early.
Seems like I'm a bachelor again.
Oh, it was just as well.
Mr. Bernstein
was beginning
to make a permanent dent
in the mattress.
Oh, toddy...
I'm very much in love,
and I don't know what to do.
Here.
I can't stand to see
a grown man cry.
Sweet Adeline
sweet Adeline
Good.
My Adeline
My Adeline
You got it!
Your fair face
beams
Your fair face
beams
In All my dreams
You're real lucky, boss.
Lucky?
Yeah, you're lucky you
didn't break anything.
I couldn't feel any worse
if I broke everything.
You ever seen so many bruises?
Yeah. on a whole
football team.
Feel like I spent the night
in a cement mixer.
Hello, faggot.
Oh, I knew things
were going too good to last.
Hold it.
Now, head up just a touch.
Herr Victor doesn't
look very well.
Oh, it's nothing serious.
A few nights flat on his back
under a specialist,
and he'll be as good as new.
Good.
Victor, darling, do you think
you could possibly
manage to look
a little less...
Funereal?
Rene, darling?
Yes?
Why don't you go suck an egg?
I do wish you'd think about it.
I have thought about it, toddy.
For the past two weeks,
I've spent
a great deal of time
thinking about it.
And for the seven hours
I couldn't sleep last night,
I thought about it constantly.
So I've come to the conclusion
that it's just not worth it.
I am very unhappy
in the extreme,
and I don't have to be because
there is an alternative.
Tonight will be
count Victor Grazinsky's
final performance,
and tomorrow, I shall
announce to the world
that I am really Victoria Grant,
who may one day be lucky enough
to celebrate her womanhood
as Mrs. king Marchand.
Well?
Well, what?
You've made up your mind.
I want your blessing.
Can I answer the door first?
I got a problem.
Welcome.
What's wrong,
Mr. Bernstein?
King's partner Sal Andretti
showed up with a couple
of his torpedoes.
Sal put up the money
for the club,
but, uh, the mob doesn't
consider homosexuality
an acceptable life style.
Kill him, but mustn't kiss him.
Let's go,
Mr. Bernstein.
Let's go,
Mr. Bernstein.
Ooohhhhh...
Your lawyer looked,
says it's O.K.
That's reassuring.
How is my lawyer?
Picture of health.
Lipstick and a nightgown?
What, do you take turns
being the girl?
That is disgusting.
I know. It's awful.
Jesus, king.
A guy like you?
We grew up together.
Yeah, that probably had
something to do with it.
Come on, Sal, you know my half
is worth 10 times that much.
Yeah.
Sign the paper.
Hello, darling.
Ick!
Hi, Sal.
Who the hell are you?
Just remember your
blood pressure, Nummy.
This is the count.
Nummy?
This is Mr. toddy.
They were lovers
before, uh... Ahem,
Pookie showed up.
That is disgusting!
They're perverted.
Pookie?
Can I have a word
with you, Norma?
What's it that you need?
It's very important.
Get your mitts off me!
It's going to change
your whole life.
Sal! Get this... aah!
Freeze.
What... what's going...
What are you doing?
Oh, my god.
What is hap...
What are you...
Oh, god!
What is happening?
Wait!
Lock the door.
What's going on in there?
You know, you guys
are in a lot of trouble.
You two-timing
son of a bitch!
He's a woman!
Labisse is on his way here
with the police.
He claims you're not a man.
Stay there.
Yes?
I am inspector Bernheim.
Yes?
Stand aside.
I know All about
your count Grazinsky,
and when the inspector
has exposed the impostor...
impostor?
Yes impostor! You will
All be arrested
for perpetrating a public fraud!
Please, inspector.
Well?
You idiot!
What?
That's a man.
Oh, it can't be.
No? Well, when I walked in,
the person in that room
was naked from the waist down.
And if that was a woman,
then she was wearing
the greatest disguise
that I have ever seen!
Wait! There is
something wrong!
It can't be!
I hired a private detective...
Hurry.
Ladies and gentlemen,
once again, the night club
is proud to present
the one, the only...
Victoria!
la-ha la la la la la
la la la
la-ha-ha-ha
la-ha-ha-ha-ha
la-ha-ha-ha
la la la la
la la la la la la la la
Ooh.
La
la-ha-ha
There was once
a shady dame from Seville
Used to wander
round the town dressed to kill
And men, if they dared,
stood and stared
When she passed their way
The lady
knocked them out
There's no doubt
'Cause they'd shout
Ole!
Oh, Merde.
All day
Seville isn't that much
to shout about
But when she was out
Traffic stood still
By god, you did it.
Dressed like a vamp
Or a Pamplona tramp
Ah!
At will...
Monsieur Labisse, my bill.
Where the hell am I?
Oh, you bastard!
The rest of the tale's
not a pretty one
Pity one isn't for sale
Only two ears
and a tail
Did they find by the blind
on her sill
No one knows what became
Of the shady
Dame
Oh, yes...
Some hit show!
Ha-ha-ha
ha-ha-ha
Is that it?
La-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha-ha
la-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha
Eee
Eee
Lo-ho-ho-ho-ho
ho-ho-ho-ho
The shady daaa...
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
You bitches.
A-a-a-a-a-ame
From sev...
¡Ole!
Ole!
Bravo!
Ha ha ha!
Bravo!
Bravo!
You were marvelous...
And I never want
to see any of you again.
Aah!
I might as well.
They're the last roses
I'll ever see.
Vous.
