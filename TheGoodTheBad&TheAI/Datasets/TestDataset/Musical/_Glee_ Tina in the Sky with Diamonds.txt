So how does it work
with gay marriage,
you take his last name
or does he take yours,
or ***?
Right now, I'm honestly just
excited that Kurt said yes.
Hey, are you looking
forward to prom?
I fell asleep last night
while Tina was texting me
about her prom dress.
It's really nice
that you're going
with her, by the way.
Yeah, I guess so.
I don't know, I just...
you know, it's my senior prom,
so I kind of wish
I was going with somebody
I really care about.
Damn, I have seriously
been unlucky in love.
Come on, guys,
we're back with the Beatles!
We're leaving
the mop-tops behind
and moving into
their experimental years.
Now, the  album
marked a turning point
for the group, where they
literally and figuratively
let their hair down.
Now, the Beatles
were the biggest
musical act in the world.
They could have remained
in their comfort zones,
but instead,
they risked everything
to explore new musical worlds.
They had something
important to say,
and they weren't going to let
something as silly as
the fear of failure
get in their way.
SUE :
Good afternoon, McKinley High.
This year, the proms
are being fused into
one giant Brundleprom.
What's a Brundleprom?
I don't get that reference.
That's from
SUE:
And now for the moment
that will crush 99%
of your misguided views
about your own popularity.
Here are your nominees
for Prom King and Queen.
First, here are your nominees
for Prom King:
Blaine Anderson...
...Mohamed Omar,
Artie Abrams...
Yeah!
... "Stoner"  Brett Bukowski.
Wait, I-I really didn't get
nominated for king?
And now onto the Queen.
TINA:
Kitty Wilde...
But I'm a sophomore.
...Aimee Ryan...
...Jordan Stern.
And, inexplicably,
Tina Cohen-Chang.
Yes! Yes!
Congratulations.
Yes! Yes! Oh, my God, yes!
Six of you will be disappointed.
Yes! Yeah!
Yeah! Yes!
Tina. Wow!
Even though I'm not nominated,
it's such an honor
to be going to prom
with a potential queen.
Oh...
Sorry, Sam.
It was so nice of you to offer
to go with me,
but I'm going to have
to decline your invitation.
But you already accepted.
Yeah, Tina, this
is very uncool.
Losing is uncool.
I need to maximize my odds
of taking the crown,
so I think I'm going to go
with a group of single gals
to corner the dejected
wallflower vote.
And I am going for it.
This is my chance
to be bigger than Jesus.
So can I count on
all your votes?
:
Awkward.
You've got mine.
Besides,
I've got more shots
at Prom Queen.
It's Tina's time.
I agree. Hit it!
You say you want
a revolution
Well, you know
We all want
to change the world...
What?
Later.
Seriously?
Congratulations, Tina.
Seriously?
CUSTOMER:
Uh, do you have...
That's it.
My dreams of playing
Fanny Brice are over.
I'm sure it isn't over.
If I got it,
I would've heard by now.
Okay? And-and-and
the thing is,
is that I wasn't just
auditioning for this for myself.
I was auditioning
for everyone at McKinley.
Okay? I wanted to show
that we're talented enough
to make it in this
insane business.
Okay, well, one of us
sort of already did.
I booked a commercial.
It's a little embarrassing,
because it was for that
yeast infection medication,
Yeast-I-Stat.
But they sent me a rough cut.
Do you want to see?
Yeah.
Let's face it.
There are good kinds of yeast,
and bad kinds of yeast.
But bad yeast goes scat
with Yeast-I-Stat.
I like my yeast in my bagel...
but not in my muffin.
Did you hear the news?
Let's have a chat
Bad yeast goes scat
With Yeast-I-Stat.
I'm free!
Wow.
That's...
that's great.
Honestly, if it
were anyone else,
I'd be so jealous,
but I'm-I'm-I'm...
really proud of you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, hi, Kitty.
Could I talk to you
for a second?
I was so psyched
that a fellow Cheerio!
Was nominated for Prom Queen.
Thanks, Bree.
And then I heard
that you weren't
going to campaign for it,
and instead you were
throwing your support
to that Asian girl
from Glee Club
because you thought
it was "her turn."
Now, if that's true,
you might want to tie
yourself down,
because this is gonna
be a rough ride.
I just wanted to remind you
that a Cheerio!
Has not won Prom Queen
for several years now.
We've had Prom Queens
from Glee Club,
including the Jewish girl
and a gay dude.
And if we're not careful,
I swear to God we're gonna have
a black transsexual
named Unique as Prom Queen
before we have a Cheerio!
As Prom Queen.
Now, I know you're
thinking to yourself:
"But O.M.G., Bree,
I love the Asian girl
from Glee Club."
Well, punch yourself in the face
so I don't have to.
I do not give a flying fart,
and the Cheerios!
Do not give a flying fart,
about how much you love
your sisters from Glee Club.
You have 51 weeks
out of the year
to love your sisters
from Glee Club,
and this week is not...
I repeat, not...
one of them.
This week is about winning
Prom Queen for the Cheerios!,
and that's not gonna happen
if you're off campaigning
for Kimchi Cohen-Barf
or whoever.
Are you an idiot, Kitty?
That's not
a rhetorical question.
I literally want you to tell me
if you're mentally slow,
so I can be sure
you're not nominated
for future prom courts.
Sam. I didn't know
you were gonna be in here.
Oh. Hey, Mr. Shue.
Yeah.
You know, a lot of people
say the Beatles were the,
like, the best
band ever, right?
That's right.
Well, what if I told you that
the Beatles wrote
exactly zero songs
about what it feels like
when you tell a girl
that you don't think is hot
you'll go to prom with her
because you feel bad,
and then you think you're gonna
get nominated for Prom King
and then you don't,
and the not-hot girl says,
"I don't want to go
to prom with you anymore."
Would you still say they were
the greatest band ever?
SUE:
Hey there, Buttchin.
Ah, Samgelina Jolie.
Oh, I hate to interrupt
the blatantly
homoerotic overtones
of whatever the two of you are
on the verge of crying about,
so I will be brief.
Now, seeing as
how your students
in the glee club come and
go for weeks at a time
with no explanation whatsoever,
I'm sure that it will not
come to you as a surprise
that we have an abysmal
attendance record
at this school due to illness.
Therefore, I am instituting
mandatory vaccinations
at this school,
starting with your
pansexual orgy
of future patient zeroes,
the glee club.
When you say vaccinations,
do you mean shots?
That's right, Imbecile
Homeless Teen Drifter.
And we will begin
with the polio vaccine.
WILL:
Sue, polio was all but
eradicated in the 1950s.
Or so they'd have us believe.
I saw a documentary
last night on FDR,
and it made me very suspicious
about that glee kid
in the wheelchair.
Artie? He was in a car accident
when he was a kid.
Fact: there is a meningitis
outbreak in Los Angeles.
Fact: Mercedes Jones
recently returned
from Los Angeles...
Wait, I cannot
get a vaccination.
Needles totally freak me out.
Sue, I'm all about keeping
the kids in this school healthy,
but this is ridiculous.
Hey, I would watch
your tone with me
if I were you,
Busted Timberfake.
I'm not your coworker anymore.
I'm your boss.
And what I say goes.
And if you and Nipples
the Strippin' Clown
don't get your shots
by the end of the week,
you're fired.
What's going on in here?
Carmen Tibideaux
needed volunteers
for the annual
NYADA piano tuning.
So, did you hear about
Santana's good news?
That she doesn't have
a yeast infection?
I'm really happy for her.
Okay, what's wrong with you?
Because the Rachel I know
would be furious at Santana
for breezing into town
and beating us at
booking the first gig.
You have lost your mojo
obsessing over this part.
We can't let our
feelings of self-worth
be determined by
some part in a play.
That's easy for you to say;
you just got engaged.
True, but I'm not pinning
all my future happiness on it.
I'm telling you, you have
got to get your mojo back.
Right here, right now.
This second.
Jo Jo was a man
who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jo Jo left his home
in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass
Get back
Get back...
Get back to where
you once belonged
Get back
Get back...
Get back to where
you once belonged
Get back, Jo Jo
Ah, ah, ah
Ooh...
Yeah
Go home!
Oh, oh, oh
Sweet Loretta Martin
Thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her
say she's got it coming
But she gets it
while she can
Oh, get back
Get back
Get back to where
you once belonged
Get back
Get back...
Get back to where
you once belonged
Get back, brother!
Ooh, ooh
Back to where
you once belonged
Oh...
Oh, get back  I'll get back
Yeah, get back
Yeah, get back
Get back to where
you once belonged
Yeah, get back
Yeah, get back
Get back
Get back to where
you once belonged
Whoa-oh-oh...
Oh!
Oh...
No, no...
- Hello?
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Oh!
Are you here for your
polio/meningitis cocktail?
I wasn't sure if
I should call it
polingitus or meningiolio.
I like the second one;
it sounds like Italian food.
: I'm going
to give him a shot he can't refuse.
Anyways, yes, I am
here for my shot.
To be honest,
I'm kind of freaked
out by needles,
and even if I wasn't,
I'd kind of be freaked out
by you with a needle.
I saw you kill that sausage.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that, I know.
I had kind of a...
an extended panic attack
during the two weeks we studied
injections last semester.
Wait, are you not a real nurse?
I'm a sophomore in college.
This is kind of an internship
to help me get
into nursing school.
Okay. Ready for our shot?
Is that the same needle
you put in that sausage?
Good eye.
You know what?
I'm-I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna come
back later, okay?
It was cool meeting you.
Penny Owen.
Sam Evans.
Here are the latest
prom poll numbers.
And your 3:00 coffee.
I said no caffeine until prom.
I can't afford to look tired
like some sad, anemic dishrag.
Oh, my God!
What is with these numbers?
There's been a sudden spike
in Kitty's popularity.
TINA:
Kitty?
This is unbelievable!
Unbelievable.
Tina, I didn't put these up.
That's not even me.
That's my head photoshopped
onto Olivia Munn.
Oh, please.
I should've known
that when you weirdly
said you'd support me,
it was just some
classic backstabby,
gaslighty Kitty mind game.
Hey, uh, what's with
these posters?
I thought you were
supporting Tina.
And why is
your head photoshopped
onto Olivia Munn's body
from February 2011?
What? I read
Don't worry, Tina.
Come on.
This is Tina's one big chance
to finally get what she wants.
Why does no one believe me?
Oh, right.
The habitual lying.
SANTANA:
I dig your name.
So, do you think
that your parents,
like, knew that you were gonna
grow up to be a lesbian
giving you a boy name?
I'm a not a lesbian.
Oh, uh...
You just wear so much
eyeliner... I don't...
I'm totally kidding.
I love lady parts.
Dani is short for Danielle.
And, no, I don't
think they knew.
My parents are actually
kind of d-bags.
They caught me making out
with a girl in the basement
and all hell broke loose.
I grabbed my guitar,
and never looked back.
What about you?
My parents were pretty cool.
Grandma not so much.
I had a girlfriend.
And she was bi.
Any chance of you guys
getting back together?
I love her, but, um, it's over.
It's probably for the best.
I think you need
a 100% Sapphic goddess.
Um... I think I'm gonna
go get the salt...
the salt sh-shakers.
Shakers...
Oh, my, God, I am sensing
some serious energy exchanges
happening over there.
No, no, help me, okay?
I'm getting that stinky
panic sweat under my boobs.
Why? She's cute, she's sweet,
she's gay, ask her out.
Okay, I've never been
with an actual lesbian.
It's been all bisexuals
like Brittany
or college girls trying
to experiment.
You're scared.
I've never seen you
scared before.
It's so cute!
You tell no one of this.
Seriously.
I think that I might like her,
and it is terrifying.
Listen.
She seems like
a really smart girl.
And if she's a smart girl,
then she's not gonna miss out
on an opportunity
to be with someone
as amazing as you.
You're right.
Okay?
She's smart.
Okay, go clean up.
Okay.
Mmm, mm-mm.
Hey, Sam, we're gonna go pick up
our tux rentals.
You coming? Uh, could you
guys grab mine for me?
I need to, uh...
go to the nurse's office...
snake bite.
That looks like a human bite.
From a really big mouth.
You sure you didn't
bite yourself
and pretend it was a snake?
Why would I do that?
Oh, I don't know, maybe...
maybe for the same exact reason
why you left math
to get a Band-Aid
for your hangnail?
She's gonna be
at the prom chaperoning.
You can always just take it
slow and ask her for a dance.
She'll stop liking me, okay?
The key for me is to only spend
a few minutes with a girl
and then get away.
My personality is like
a radioactive asteroid.
Spend too much time with it
and it could kill you.
That's insane.
You have an amazing personality.
You have all of your...
impressions.
And-and all of your...
impressions.
I was thinking of doing
my Denzel impression for her.
:
All right, all right.
I'm coming for you
and when I do,
she didn't drink the vodka,
I drank the vodka.
Remember those Titans.
All right, training day.
You better come correct
'cause I'm coming
for you and when I do,
it's your day to train.
Training day is here.
My man, all right.
Embrace the Beatles mantra.
"Charge forth fearlessly."
You may get hurt.
Some girls are worth it.
And I have a feeling
you think she is.
Go get them, Denzel.
Something in the way
she moves
Attracts me like
no other lover
Something in the way
She woos me
I don't want
to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile
She knows
That I don't need
No other lover
Something in her style
That shows me
I don't want
to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You're asking me
will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now,
it may show
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way
she knows
And all I have to do
is think of her
Something in the things
She shows me
I don't want
to leave you now
You know I believe and how.
Why are you packing up
your things?
Sue fired me for incompetence.
I was giving one
of her Cheerios!
A urine test
and another one a vaccination,
and I got my vials all mixed up,
and, well...
you can guess what happened.
Well, y-you can't leave.
Why?
Because we only
hung out once so far.
And-and it wasn't
for long, but, you know,
I had a great time with you.
And you're, like, almost
totally normal and cool.
Really?
All right.
I want you to give me my shot.
If you can get me
to take this shot,
Sue will have to see how great
of a nurse you are and keep you.
One of these days,
I'm gonna get this right.
Might as well be today.
You can't fire her.
Who?
Nurse Penny.
You can't get rid of her.
I mean, I've been terrified
of needles my entire life.
And she just used her impressive
nursing skills
and nurturing bedside manner
to give me a meningitis shot
in my butt.
I'm sorry, but your mouth
is incredibly distracting.
Please put a pair of
white cotton panties
over your head and cover up
that horizontal
talking moose knuckle.
Just promise me
Penny still has a job here.
Oh...
I believe someone's
got a little crush.
No, I don't. I don't have...
Fine. You've convinced me.
Nurse Bumble McQuirkypoops
will remain at McKinley High.
I could use a new plaything.
You know, yesterday, I
asked her for two aspirin,
and she accidentally
gave me steroids.
Which means
I can finally
finally stop buying
from Mark McGwire.
He always wants to hang out,
and I just want to get
the hell out of his house.
Why are you still here?
Get the hell out of my office.
Tina for Prom Queen.
Don't be racist.
Vote for Tina.
Vote for Tina.
Don't be racist.
If you don't vote for Tina,
you're a racist.
Are you doing okay, Dottie?
Ooh.
How do you know my name?
Come on.
Everyone knows Dottie Kazatori.
Tina Cohen-Chang's
personal slave.
Break it down.
You hate Tina, don't you?
I do wish she'd hurry up
and graduate.
How would you like
to be on the Cheerios!?
That's, like, my life's dream.
BREE: That's why
you're perfect
for our little plan.
Uh...
Mazel, Berry.
Looks like you're gonna make it
through your first graveyard
shift without collapsing.
What is that?
The latest edition
of
Hot off the presses.
"Hot off the presses"?
What does that mean? I'm
over my fear of rejection.
And I'm no longer
afraid of failing.
I'm auditioning for everything
I'm remotely right for.
Including but not limited
to the role of Bottom
at the Cape Cod Players
production of
and also Annie Sullivan's
landlady in
now casting at the New Jersey
Theater for the Deaf.
Where do you think you're going?
You still have ten minutes
and two dozen
sugar caddies to caddy.
See, I thought that
that was something
that you and Dani
could do alone.
Okay, no, come on.
You are not playing Yente
the lesbian matchmaker.
I'm so tired.
I have to get home.
No, you're not. You have to...
Bye, Rachel.
See you tomorrow.
Good-bye, Dani.
Aren't you heading out, too?
No, not yet.
I like to watch the sun rise
over that building.
I just love how the diner goes
from being quiet and dark
to suddenly just... glowing.
I've never seen it.
Well, stick around.
We'll watch it together.
Okay.
Here comes the sun
Doo, doo-doo
Here comes the sun
And I say it's all right
Mmm-mm
Little darling
It's been a long
Cold, lonely winter
Little darling
It feels like years
Since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Doo, doo-doo
Here comes the sun, I say
It's all right
Da-da-da, da-da-da,
da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
Ah-ah-ah
Little darling
The smiles
returning to their faces
Little darling,
it seems like years
Since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Doo, doo-doo
Here comes the sun
And I say it's all right
Da-da-da, da-da-da,
da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Oh, oh-oh
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Ah... uh-huh
Oh... oh...
Uh-huh
Ah-oh...
Little darling
I feel that ice
is slowly melting
Little darling
It seems like years
since it's been clear
Yeah
Here comes the sun
Doo, doo-doo
Here comes the sun,
and I say
It's all right
Da-da-da, da-da-da,
da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
It's all right
Da-da-da, da-da-da,
da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
Sun, sun, sun,
here it comes.
Well, this is where I get off.
So I guess that's good-bye?
For now.
See you around.
It was 20 years ago today
Sergeant Pepper taught
the band to play
They've been going in
and out of style
But they're guaranteed
to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known
for all these years
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band
Stick with me, dateless ladies,
and you'll have a great time.
Hope I got all your votes.
We're Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy
the show
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let
the evening go
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely,
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely
Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band
Oh, hey, didn't see you there.
It seems like someone
convinced Sue to un-fire me.
That person must
really like you.
Hey. Were you faking
being sick all week?
I even bit myself once.
I don't really want
to stop the show
But I thought you might
like to know
That the singer's
gonna sing a song
And he wants you all
to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only
Billy Shears
Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band
Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band.
Caught up in the moment...
You know you don't have
to just stand here, right?
You can...
Oh, I know.
But as a minor-league nurse,
I figured I should be
on standby
for any dancing-related
injuries.
I'm the one who's
most likely to go out there
and hurt myself
on the dance floor,
so as a minor-league nurse,
it is kind of
your responsibility
to dance with me.
God, I don't know.
I bust moves, literally.
I'm taking those.
Oh, my God, Tina!
Your dress is so pretty!
Thank you so much.
It's designer.
I hope you guys voted for Tina.
You guys look beautiful.
Psst! Come here!
Everything set?
Yes.
Did you add extra shards of ice?
Yes, and I bought the slushees
in Toledo
so no one could link me
to the crime.
Oh, my God, I just remembered,
I've got a viola lesson tonight.
Oh, I know you're not
backing out at the last minute.
I  you don't want to spend
the rest of your life
being a pathetic bottom-feeder.
Fact: you wet your bed
until seventh grade.
Fact...
Stop, stop! Okay, I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Showtime.
SUE : Congratulations, New
Directions, on accomplishing the impossible:
you've made me hate The Beatles.
Your nominations
for Prom King are:
Stoner Brett,
Blaine Anderson,
Artie Abrams,
and that Radical Cleric kid.
And now your nominees
for Prom Queen:
Neck-brace Cheerio!,
Asian number one,
Kitty I-forget-your-last-name,
and... some other chick.
And now here's the moment
you've all been waiting for
because your lives are
so devoid of meaning
something like this seems
very important.
This can't be right.
Okay, what the hell
do I care, huh?
Your Prom King
and Prom Queen are...
Stoner Brett
and Tina Cohen-Chang.
No...!
:
What the hell?
TINA:
MARLEY:
We need to get you out of
those wet clothes
and into something dry.
Just leave me like this!
:
I swear, I just thought
for one lousy night of my life,
I could be that girl.
But who am I kidding?
I'm not that girl,
and I will never be that girl!
Tina, where are you going?
:
I'm going home, Sam!
Okay, Tina, stop.
You have two choices,
and whichever one you pick,
we will be supportive.
But we can either
drive you home,
or we can clean you up,
and you can go back out
there and own that prom.
This is your prom, Queen T.
I can't go back in there.
I don't even have a dress
to wear.
You can have mine.
Or mine.
Or mine.
Although it would be
a crime to break this look.
Come on, Tina.
We're all with you.
You want to be that girl?
Then go  that girl.
Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song
and make it better
Remember to let her
into your heart
And you can start
to make it better
Hey, Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to
go out and get her
The minute you let her
under your skin
Then you begin
to make it better
So let it out and let it in
Hey, Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone
to perform with
And don't you know
that it's just you
Hey, Jude, you'll do
The movement you need
is on your shoulder
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah-nah-nah-nah
Yeah...
Hey, Jude,
don't make it bad
Take a sad song
and make it better
Remember to let her
under your skin
Then you'll begin
To make it better
Better, better, better,
better, better
Yeah!
Nah, nah, nah,
nah-nah-nah, nah
Nah-nah-nah, nah
Hey, Jude
Jude-Judey, Judey, Judey,
Judey, Judey!
Nah, nah, nah,
nah-nah-nah, nah
Sing a sad song
Nah-nah-nah, hey, Jude
Jude, hey, Jude, yeah...
Nah, nah, nah,
nah-nah-nah, nah
Nah-nah-nah, nah
Hey, Jude
I'm Tina Cohen-Chang.
I accept your crown!
Long live prom!
Nah, nah, nah,
nah-nah-nah, nah
Whoo, yeah-yeah!
Nah-nah-nah, nah
Hey, Jude.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Oh, get in this office
and sit down!
Ow! Ow!
- Who is this?
- Bree.
This is the girl responsible
for the giant slushee bucket
at prom.
No, I mean, literally,
who is this?
She's in a
Cheerios! uniform,
but I swear
I've never seen her before.
You put me on the team.
Black Cheerio!...
you think I'd remember
a black Cheerio.
It's not like
we get a lot of them.
Sue Sylvester, this girl needs
to be punished.
Now, I'll admit that
when the bucket of goo
hit the Asian girl in the head,
it was hilarious.
Then the bucket itself fell
and hit the stoner
kid in the head,
knocked him
straight to the ground.
Priceless.
Top-notch entertainment.
But that does not change
the fact
that this girl right here
needs to understand
that pulling hilarious,
top-notch pranks
has consequences.
She should be suspended.
Bree...
I'm promoting you
to captain of the Cheerios!
And buying you a Le Car.
ROZ: What?!
What?
Chocolate Cheerio!, oh,
that evil glimmer in your eye
reminds me of a
young Sue Sylvester.
You found a brand-new way
to go after the glee club,
and I want you to keep at it.
ROZ: I thought
you said you wanted
the glee club to win nationals.
I do, but the glee club
needs an enemy.
The only time they
were any good
was when I was hell-bent
on destroying them.
Plus, I once sang onstage
with them in plaid pajamas,
and ever since, I don't think
they find me quite so scary.
I want you to go after the
glee club with all you've got.
I want it to get weird.
I want you to pull
something so psychotic
that they can't help but start
crying when they think about it
in the middle of the
inevitable Journey song
they'll sing to
win at nationals
after deciding on it
at the very last moment.
You got it?
I think I need an agent.
I guess those
contracts I signed
for those commercials said that
I waived my right to residuals
in exchange for a lifetime
supply of Yeast-I-Stat.
Though I don't
know whose toxic vagina
would need that
much of that stuff.
I mean, if you're
producing that much yeast,
you should probably
start a bakery.
Are you ready for me?
Sorry. What is Lady Hummel
doing here?
Working. Vogue.com doesn't pay,
and I need some seed cash
to start my Madonna cover band.
You guys, this is so great.
I feel like I'm on
season one.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts,
because soon you'll be
dumping us to play Fanny Brice.
Oh, no, that ship has sailed.
If I got it,
I would have heard by now.
Rachel, be positive!
I am positive, okay?
My whole life,
I've been looking
to be a part of something
special to feel special,
but the truth is,
is that I  special, okay?
And I don't need producers
to tell me that.
I'm gonna play this part,
and if it's not
in this production,
then that is their loss.
Isn't it amazing
how life seems so easy
when you just don't give a fart?
I mean, look at this.
Hummel is getting married,
Berry is just
full of confidence,
and I finally have a girlfriend
who I don't have to worry about
straying for penis.
Then let's make a pledge:
we stay in this town together
for two years, all right?
For soaring success
or miserable failure.
None of us bail
until then, okay, no matter what.
Okay.
Okay. Pinky swear.
Come on.
Put those long fingernails
in there.
GUNTHER:
Someone in booth 14
is looking for the short one.
Go.
I take this.
Gunther, that's my Yeast-I-St...
What the hell?
Mr. Campion.
Do you have
any whole cakes, Rachel?
Just a whole cake?
Mm-hmm. I'd like one.
Okay.
But I need you to write
something on it for me.
Can you do that?
Yeah.
Good.
I want you to write, mm...
"Congratulations, Rachel Berry.
You are Fanny Brice."
:
Are you serious?
Are you serious?!
Really?!
Oh, my God! Really?!
Thank you so much! Thank you!
I got Fanny!
Oh, my God!
Thank you!
I got it!
What?
I got it!
She got the part?
I got it! I got it!
Whoo! Whoo!
Thank you so much!
I got it! Yeah!
I can't wait to take this off!
When I find myself
in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing
right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
And when
the brokenhearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be
For though
they may be parted
There is still a chance
that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be...
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be...
Ooh...
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light
that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow
Let it be
I wake up
to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be...
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be...
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be...
Whoo!
