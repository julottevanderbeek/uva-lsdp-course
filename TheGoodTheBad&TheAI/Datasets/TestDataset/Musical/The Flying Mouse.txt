And go saiIing
through the sky
I wouId fIap my wings
and fIy
I wouId go
from tree to tree
Oh, the other mice
wouId envy me
Help!
Help! Help!
Help!
Aah! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Poor butterfly!
Aw!
Brave little mouse...
you've been kind to me.
l'll grant one wish.
What shall it be?
l want to fly.
Oh, a mouse
was never meant to fly.
Think carefully! Beware!
Please! l want to
fly like the birds!
Well, if wings
are what you wish...
then you shall have a pair.
Hello there, brother.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
l--l'm not your brother.
l--l'm a mouse.
A mouse?!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
No mouse can fly.
They ain't got wings.
So if you ain't a bat--
Ha ha ha ha ha!
You're nothing.
Think of that.
A mouse? Ha ha!
-Mouse?! Ha ha!
-A mouse?
Ha ha ha!
You're nothin',
you're nothin'
Aha ha ha ha ha ha!
Why are you crying,
little mouse?
Don't you like to fly?
l'm not a mouse.
l'm a nothin'.
l wish that l could die.
Come, come, my little friend.
Cheer up.
Start anew.
Do your best.
and life will smile on you.
Oh, Ma! Ma!
Ma!
