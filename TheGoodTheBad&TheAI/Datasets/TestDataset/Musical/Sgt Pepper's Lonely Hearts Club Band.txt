How do you honor someone
who had done so much...
to make so many people so happy?
Heartland decided to erect
a Sergeant Pepper weather vane...
on top of our city hall.
It would always point
the way to happiness.
And as mayor,
I presided over the ceremony.
At the end, Sergeant Pepper assured us
that he would play us one more tune.
Oh, well.
August 10, 1958.
A day none of us
will ever forget.
To the town of Heartland,
he left his musical instruments.
These instruments have the power
to make dreams come true.
And as long as they remained
in Heartland's care,
humanity would live
happily forever after.
Sergeant Pepper left
his wholesome grandson, Billy Shears,
This band would feature
Billy's three best friends.
We wondered if there would ever be a new
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
And we wondered what
the new band would sound like.
It was 20 years ago today
Sergeant Pepper
taught the band to play
They've been going
in and out of style
But they're guaranteed
to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known
for all these years
Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely
Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home
I don't really want to
stop the show
But I thought you
might like to know
That the singer's gonna
sing a song
And he wants you all
to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
What would you think
if I sang out of tune
Would you stand up
and walk out on me
Lend me your ears
and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to
sing out of key
Mmm, I get high with a little help
from my friends
Yeah, gonna try with a little help
from my friends
Does it worry you to be alone
How do I feel
by the end of the day
Are you sad because
you're on your own
No, I get by with a little help
from my friends
Yeah, I get high with a little help
from my friends
Do you need anybody
I need somebody to love
Would you believe
in a love at first sight
Yes, I'm certain that
it happens all the time
I can't tell you
but I know it's mine
Yeah, I get high with a little help
from my friends
Oooh, I'm gonna try with
a little help from my friends
I get high with a little help
from my friends
With a little help
from my friends
I'm fixing a hole
where the rain gets in
And stops my mind
from wandering
I'm filling the cracks
that ran through the door
That kept my mind
from wandering
Where it will go
And it really doesn't matter
If I'm wrong I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there
who disagree and never win
And wonder why
they don't get in my door
I'm painting my room
in a colorful way
And when my mind
is wandering
There I will go
I'm fixing a hole
where the rain gets in
And stops my mind
from wandering
-  Where
-  Where
-  It
-  It
-  Will
-  Will
-  Go

Oh, one and a two
One, two, three
Da-da, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah bah, bah, bah-bah
Dee-dee, dee-doo, dee-doo
dee-diddledy diddledy diddledy
And one
Two
One, two, three, four
It's getting better
all the time
-  Used to get mad at my school
-  But I can't complain
The teachers that taught me
weren't cool
-
Better
It's getting better
Me used to be
angry young man
Keep your mind on business.
- Take over Heartland.
Why?
We hate love.
We hate joy.
We love money.
Money. Money.
Money. Money.
It's getting better
all the time
Better, better, better
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun and I say
It's all right
Little darlin'
It's been a long
cold, lonely winter
Little darlin'
It feels like years
since it's been here
Here comes the sun

The smiles returning
to their faces
Little darlin'
It feels like years
since it's been here

Meet the Wife
Big Disco Show--
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans
for nobody
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me
Nowhere man, please listen
You don't know

Nowhere man
The world is

Well, you should see
Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking
but she looks like a man
You should see her in drag
dressed in a polythene bag
Yeah, you should see
Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get a dose of her
in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when
she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that
makes the
She came in through
the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb
and wonders
By the banks
of her own lagoon
Didn't anybody tell her
Didn't anybody see
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
She said she'd
always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought
I knew the answer
Well, I knew
but I could not say
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best
to help me
She could steal
but she could not rob
Didn't anybody tell her
Didn't anybody see
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh, yeah
The Sergeant Pepper Special.

Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark
trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy up some clothes
Keeps a 10-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Yes, a mean old man.
Such a mean old man
I agree. A mean old man.
Steal the instruments.
Take the cornet to Dr. Maxwell.
Take the tuba to Father Sun.
Bring the saxophone to me. F.V.B.
Keep the drum for yourself.
''A dirty  man''?
Yes, a dirty old man!
Wednesday morning at 5:00
As the day begins
Silently closing
her bedroom door
Leaving the note that
she hoped would say more
She goes down the stairs
to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning
the back door key
Stepping outside she is free
Daddy, our baby's gone
Why would she treat us
so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me
For so many years
Bye-bye
Wake up, Mr. Mustard.
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
Wake up. Wake up.
Look. Strawberry is leaving.
Picture yourself
in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees
and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you
You answer quite slowly
A girl with
kaleidoscope eyes
Towering over your head
Look for the girl
with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone
Lucy in the sky
with diamonds
Lucy in the sky
with diamonds
Lucy in the sky
with diamonds
Ahhh
Follow her down
to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people
Eat marshmallow pies
Newspaper taxis
appear on the shore
Climb in the back
with your head in the clouds
And you're gone
Lucy in the sky
with diamonds
Lucy in the sky
with diamonds
Lucy in the sky
with diamonds
Picture yourself
on a train in a station
With plasticine porters
With looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is
there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky
with diamonds
Talkin' about Lucy
Talkin' about Lucy
Lucy in the sky
with diamonds
Ahhh
Lucy in the sky
with diamonds
Talkin' about Lucy
Lucy in the sky
with diamonds
Lucy in the sky
with diamonds
Talkin' about Lucy
Ohhh, Lucy
Lucy in the sky
with diamonds
Oh, darling
Please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Oh, darling
If you leave me
Leave me alone
When you told me
You didn't need me anymore
Well, you know
I nearly broke down and died
Oh, darling
If you leave me
I'll never make it alone
-
When you told me
Well, you know
You didn't need me anymore
Well, you know
You know
I nearly broke down
And died
Oh, darling
Please believe me
Well, while Mustard roamed through
the building looking for Strawberry,
she and her Heartland friends
dashed to the van and captured it.
Turn on the big screen.
Take the cornet to Dr. Maxwell.
Joan was quizzical
Studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone
with a test tube
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison
majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
Can I take you
out to the pictures
Jo-o-o-oan
But as she's
getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door
Bang, bang
Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang
Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead
Back in school again
Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid
an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay
when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times
I must not be so-o-o-o
But when she turns
her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind
Bang, bang
Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang, bang
Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure she was dead
Ho, ho, ohh
Painting testimonial pictures
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie
screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free
The judge does not agree
And he tells them so
Oh, oh, oh
But as the words
are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind
Bang, bang
Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, bang
Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure
he was dead, whoa
Bang, bang
Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang, bang
Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure he was dead
Wh-wh-wh-whoa
Whoa
Whoa-o-whoa
Whoa-o-whoa
Wha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
One down, three to go.
Shh!
Congratulations. Two down, two to go.
Take the tuba to Father Sun.
We hate love!
We hate joy!
We love money!
We hate love!
We hate joy!
We love money!
We hate love!
We hate joy!
We love money!
We hate love!
We hate joy!
We love money!
Because the world is round
It turns me on
Because
The world
Is round
Because the wind is high
It blows my mind
Love is old
Love is new
Love is all
Love is you, sweetie
The sky is blue
It makes me cry
Because
The sky
Is blue

Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing
to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Living is easy
with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be
someone but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Always know
sometimes think it's me
But you know I know
when it's a dream
I think I know I mean
Ah yes, but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing
to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
There was one instrument
still missing...
and now there
was no way to find it.
Heartland was in
desperate condition,
Things were really desperate.
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight
on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair
What a scene
In this way Mr. K
will challenge the world
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday
at Bishop's Gate
The Hendersons
will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through
the ring, don't be late
Messrs. K and H assure the public
Their production
will be second to none
And of course Henry the Horse
dances the waltz
And Mr. H
will demonstrate
Ten somersets
he'll undertake
On solid ground
Having been some days
in preparation
A splendid time
is guaranteed for all
And tonight, Mr. Kite is
topping the bill
You never give me
your money
You only give me
your funny paper
And in the middle
of negotiations
You break down
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle
of investigation
I break down
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone
Nowhere to go
And a job
I got the sack
Monday morning
turning back
Yellow lorry slow
Nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags
Get in a limousine
Soon we'll be
away from here
Step on the gas
and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream
Came true today
Came true today
One, two, three, four
five, six, seven
All good children
go to heaven
One, two, three, four
five, six, seven
All good children
go to heaven
One, two, three, four
five, six, seven
All good children
go to heaven
One, two, three, four
five, six, seven
All good children
go to heaven
One, two, three, four
five, six, seven
All good children
go to heaven
One, two, three, four
five, six, seven
All good children
go to heaven

Bottle of wine

You'll

I will stay with you
Stupid. Stupid.
Send me a postcard
Drop me a line

Mm-hmm.
Indicate precisely

You don't know?
You're sincerely

Oh, boy
About a lucky man
who made the grade
And though the news
was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He hadn't noticed that
the lights had changed
A crowd of people
stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he
was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today
Oh, boy
