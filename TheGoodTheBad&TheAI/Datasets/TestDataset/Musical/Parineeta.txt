Uncle, you have the blueprints
of the hospital, right?
Must be on my table.
Search it.
Oh, boy.
What happened?
How can you keep such
confidential papers like this?
How many times have I told you...
I need an assistant...
Heritage Hotel project. Our home?
Our home... a hotel?
See what Lolita's got me
with her first pay?
Chocolate. For me?
Can't you ever buy
something for yourself?
Silly girl.
- What if uncle finds out?
What are you looking at?
How much time do we
have to vacate?
End of November, I think.
This can't happen.
Navin uncle can't do this.
A profitless deal is a bad one.
I have to repay by 30th November.
Can I ever repay?
Tell me what do you want?
I could ask Shekhar...
but will he have 150,000...?
Here, keep the key.
Didn't you hear the horn?
I'll drop you if you're
on your way home.
A profit less deal is a bad one.
Navin Rai though a gentleman
is also a businessman.
Oh, hello. - Hello.
Did you meet him on
the way, Lolita?
Where have you been all
these days, Gurucharan?
I wanted to show you
my face only after...
...l'd organized at least
part of your money.
Money isn't going to disappear
all of a sudden, are they?
Return at your leisure.
Ridiculous. I'm your neighbour,
not a businessman.
You've retired now, relax.
Stop worrying.
We'll find some way.
Let's go, uncle.
Goodbye.
Let's go.
He's taken a load off me.
Let's all celebrate with your
aunt's spinach cutlets.
I know you love them.
I'm going to eat so much.
Raghu.
Anything else?
Just one, sir, where will Lolita and
her family go after eviction?
I mean, everything is ready
from our end... we're ready.
We're getting a house worth...
...two million for just 150,000...
...surely we can give them
Yes, sir.
We won't throw them out.
They can stay in our old warehouse.
But that place...?
Get it cleaned, get some electricity...
they can stay...
...there for a few days.
In any case, their house is
too classy for them.
True. But won't Shekhar's presence...?
Don't worry.
Shekhar will be in Darjeeling
finalizing the Tea Estate deal.
At least you can sleep peacefully now.
Otherwise we kept getting visitors.
But the debt still exists, and
we still have to pay it back.
Now you've started.
Hasn't Navin Rai just said...
Words don't mean anything.
We must repay him.
Who has that kind of money?
I have some money... and
we can sell mother's jewelery.
What? Sell sister's jewelery?
What's the matter with you?
How do I explain to you
that unless we repay him...
Don't worry daughter.
Please don't cry.
Have some faith in Navin Rai.
Hello, uncle. Hello, aunty.
Hello, Sunita.
Have a sweet. Charu's engaged.
Is it?
Why the long face?
You've to make
the arrangements, right?
Come on, we have to
select saris for the wedding.
When is it?
After the festival... on the 19th.
So soon?
I know. But the priest says
it's a very auspicious day.
Just need to exchange garlands...
You can't call that a wedding?
Exactly. It's such an auspicious day
that, that's all you need.
No, our Charu will go
amid a lot of fanfare.
Absolutely.
Let's go.
No, I have to go to Shekhar's.
I've just come from there...
he's out. Go later.
Go, it'll brighten your mood.
Guess what... yesterday Girish
was to come...
...shopping with me
...He didn't come with me...
and he never listens to me.
One second... - Yes.
Is Shekhar back? - Not yet.
Please let me know once he does.
OK.
Enter only if you're in peace.
Has the fuse blown again?
Let me show you the sari
I've picked out...
Here comes the ghost. I'm off.
There's a wedding to organize
and you're sitting
with the planchette.
Please sit, sis.
Ask something, sis.
The spirit's here already?
Ask something, sis? Come on...
I've asked.
And here's your answer...
P-R-O-B-L-E-M-S-O-L-V-E-D
Sis, consider your problem solved.
What's the problem?
Sis...?
What's up? - Nothing.
Now lets see who will solve it?
Girish.
Girish? - Girish?
Brother, you'll solve her...
yes, with a magnet.
What's this, Girish?
- Cheating. No...
I hate such pranks.
Lolita, Shekhar's back.
I have to go.
Who's this Shekhar?
How come you're here tonight?
Shekhar, please.
What happened?
I need some money.
Why ask? You have the key.
I need a bit more.
How much?
What? Are you buying a plane?
Direct to London, huh?
Please stop joking.
I really need that much.
Why? What happened?
Shekhar... I...
Shekhar. - Yes, father.
Sidharth's coming here to
discuss your Darjeeling trip.
Come to the study.
Now.
They will lose their ancestral home
worth two million for
just 150,000?
If I could I'd give it to them
and ask them to fling
it on Navin Rai's face.
I have that much. - What?
I can give them the money.
- But why?
Sis, its just 11,252 pounds.
While we celebrate
Charu's wedding.
Imagine them on the streets
True. If you can,
please do something.
God will bless you.
I will.
But is that the only reason,
or... Lolita. Aha. Lolita.
Sis, can't you take anything
at face value?
Have you seen yours
it's bright red.
You're too much, sis.
I can't believe this, son.
Girish is making me...
...his Managing Partner
in his new project.
Managing Partner? - Yes.
And, he's given me five years'
pay in advance too.
with no interest.
Uncle, it's your salary,
not a debt.
But son, at this age...? - What?
I'm a textile man...
You're a man of principles, uncle.
I need your values and experience.
Hear that?
OK, son. I'll accept this.
Our problems have disappeared.
Though Navin Rai is a gentleman...
Even so... a debt should be
repaid as fast as possible.
You're right, son.
I'll keep this inside.
Oh, no. No tears now.
Let's celebrate. Get dressed now.
Why?
Girish, haven't you told her?
Yeah, it's a double celebration
at Trinca's...
For Charu's wedding and...
do you have a headache today?
Come on get dressed now.
And sis, wear my heels if you like.
I'm fine in these flats.
I'm not going to fall.
Hurry up.
How will we all fit?
In a big heart.
Come on.
And Keol, try not to
mess up my shirt today.
What is this riddle called life?
Can you block it, can you
stop that which flows?
Good Morning.
Good morning. How's everything?
Your money.
Money?
The mortgage... exactly 150,000 rupees.
How did you get so much money?
Met a gentlemen just like you.
Impossible.
Did you get burnt?
You can't mortgage an
already mortgaged house.
It's not like that.
Girish... oh, you don't know him.
He's made me his Managing Partner.
Thought the least I can do
is repay your money as
I can never repay your kindness.
Please take it.
Just need your signature here.
Now if I could just have
my house papers please...
Hello, uncle. - Hello, son.
Meeting with dad?
Yes. The Goddess has
been very kind.
I've repaid my entire debt,
with interest.
Really?
The Goddess sent him from
London just to help us.
Imagine, 180,000 rupees.
See you, son.
Do come in the evening
for the prayers.
Hey, what are you doing?
Might burn your feet.
Come on, aunt... the clothes are
yours, so are the earrings...
...and now this necklace - why?
You're mine too, aren't you?
Stay away from the evil eye today...
you look beautiful.
I hope you marry a prince,
and rule where ever you go.
Let's go.
Sunita has called five times.
Now go.
Get my prince ready.
Why?
He's sulking.
Just like his father.
Says he's lost his buttons and chain.
You mean his sense of humour.
Get him ready quickly.
Just fifteen minutes left. - OK.
Just fifteen minutes left
and you're not ready yet?
Now smoke your health away.
I know what's good for me.
Why the temper? Brilliant excuse not to
show up though can't find my
buttons and chain.' So what's this?
I don't want to go.
Why?
Is this a marriage?
No conversation, no engagement
just a cold wedding invitation.
I'm not in the mood.
Weddings are dictated by an
auspicious moment... not your mood.
And they say tonight
is particularly auspicious.
Exchange garlands, and you're married.
I said I'm not going.
What's up with you?
No - what's up with all of you?
What do you mean?
You, uncle...
Why did you take money
from that stranger?
Did father ever ask for the money?
Do you know why Girish helped you?
Tell me.
To buy you.
Moulin Rouge, bailing you
out with money...
I could've helped you.
And I did ask you.
But you didn't wait.
Why did you go to him?
Where would you have
got that money from?
Why don't you understand?
I could've asked father.
And have us repay your father
with his own money?
Do you even know what he...
anyway. Thank God, it's over.
What's over?
Nothing. And...
I didn't go to Moulin Rouge.
Why?
You didn't want me to.
When did I stop you?
You were livid... kept scolding me.
Have I ever gone anywhere
without asking you?
You're always yelling at me...
Uncle and Girish made the deal,
how is it my fault?
I'm sorry.
Everyone went except me.
I'll never go.
I'm sorry.
You can have your buttons. And this...
What have you done?
Now what?
Do you know what this means tonight?
It's not a garland... it's...
Shekhar, please stop joking.
I'm not joking. You know how
auspicious tonight is, right?
Let me complete the ritual.
And with this exchange of garlands
you two are now man and wife.
Your lips intoxicate me...
...I drown in the kohl of your eyes.
Dewy morning glides your forehead...
...night resides in your tresses.
Every breath I draw for you...
...for you flutters my heart.
My life itself you win from me,
I lose, and I lose joyously.
When you touch me...
my body and heart feel adorned.
I became a married woman.
My heart sways gently,
ever so slow...
...but why it sways,
I do not know.
Repeat after me...
Where were you, sis?
Right here... inside.
She looks so pretty.
Bring the warm bread, quick.
May I serve you some?
Isn't Shekhar looking handsome today?
Girish, don't serve it cold.
Get some warm bread, man.
They know each other?
- No idea.
Cold bread is no bread.
This isn't your English bread, brother.
So what took you so long
to get here o' patriot?
I was at another wedding.
Should've told them it was
as important to come here.
But that wedding was
not possible without me.
Girish, let me serve father.
You're looking really dashing today.
Supervise the kitchen you two.
Look at Lolita... she is looking
like a bride today.
Shekhar's train leaves
at seven in the morning.
Make sure his bags are packed.
See you.
Take care of everyone
at home. - I will.
Mother and... yes... Lolita too.
Yes, yes. You take care, son.
I'll put you in jail.
Sir...
Isn't 150,000 rupees a lot for you?
- Sir?
Don't you think Girish overpaid
for a girl my son
bought with his pocket money?
Sir, please stop.
Oh. I'm not allowed?
So, what is permitted?
Shekhar buying you every day?
Or Girish, making you his life-long
mistress in one clean swoop?
You're crossing the line, sir.
I am going...
Is that a warning?
Mocking me with Girish's money?
There's a word for women
who sell themselves for money.
Don't know what you call them,
but respectable people like...
...us call them prostitutes.
Now just get out of here.
I don't want to see you or
your family's faces ever again.
...you bloody whore.
Why do I keep remembering
you so much?
That I jump off the train?
Hey, not possible.
O' the joys of a train ride,
go up and down this hillside.
You know what they are saying?
Life is like a roller coaster ride.
What do you say?
I'm talking to you and
you're not even here.
I can hear the winds murmur,
they wonder where you are.
I see you in the blossoms,
I see you in the streams...
...I see you in the cobbled
lanes of my dreams.
I can hear the winds murmur,
They wonder where you are.
I see you in the blossoms,
I see you in the streams,
I see you in the cobbled
lanes of my dreams.
The earth looks charming
the skies don their best...
...I see our home nestled
among their breast.
But with you so far,
this dream is lonely...
...come to me now,
you're my one and only.
O' the joys of a train ride,
go up and down this hillside.
I can hear the winds murmur,
they wonder where you are.
I see you in the blossoms,
I see you in the streams...
...I see you in the cobbled
lanes of my dreams.
Can you hear my soul chant,
Live always in my heart.
You're my bliss, you're my pain;
You're the summer in my rain.
Through the trail of our dreams,
bringing caravans of bliss...
...come to me, my darling,
come to me again.
O' the joys of a train ride,
go up and down this hillside.
O' the joys of a train ride,
go up and down this hillside.
I can hear the winds murmur,
they wonder where you are.
Hello, sir.
Hello. Is Sidharth here?
He's waiting for you at
the tea estate. - Good.
You've been booked at the hotel.
But I'm leaving this evening.
Today?
Give me a call tomorrow.
Surprise.
Aren't you just thrilled to see me?
Hey, what are you doing?
Why is this wall being built?
Why you are cutting our tree?
And this wall?
I don't want to see their faces.
Hey, why are you cutting our tree?
Uncle, please calm down. - Why?
Koel, take him inside.
This girl has ruined everything.
What's happening to father?
Father. - Uncle?
Father. - Uncle?
Good work, Shekhar.
I'll just complete the formalities
and be with you.
I think today is a good day for me.
Great. Now I'm tired. Work ends.
Party begins.
Let's go back to the
hotel and celebrate.
I'm afraid I have to
return this evening.
What?
Have a recording tomorrow with
fifty violinists... - Are you sure?
Of course. Would I lie to you?
I'm going to check on you.
Please call home and
ask them to send a car
to the station.
You don't worry about that.
Just make great music.
I love music.
Bye.
Where's he going?
Brother, just let me get married
to him... I'll kill him.
Porter. Take this carefully.
Father?
Is everything alright at home?
Nothing is right.
Why? Is mother well?
Nobody is well. Your mother's
blood pressure has shot up.
What happened?
Mr. Gurucharan had a heart attack
and in the turmoil they...
...decided to get Girish
and Lolita married.
How's that possible?
Everything is possible today.
Everything has a price.
The price is called out and
then auctioned off.
And all sold to the highest bidder he...
And that girl...
who used to take money
from you her whole life...
To pay up the debt of her house
she took money from...
Why didn't she come to you?
Do you know why?
Because she thinks
you're not a man...
...just a good for nothing, impotent idiot,
who lives off his father.
Will you let her think that?
This wall...?
I had it made.
I don't want to see their faces.
I just can't stand them anymore.
Mother...
She's finally fallen asleep.
Are you back, son?
Look what happened in your absence.
Mom, are Lolita and Girish...?
Yes, son.
Who told you?
Vasundhara. Maybe this
is what's best.
Enough. The doctor has
asked you to rest.
There's no need to go there.
Yes, there is.
Your fees, doctor. - Thank You.
We've overcome this crisis, Girish.
But you have to take a lot of care.
I'll give you a referral.
Hello, Shekhar. You're back?
How's uncle? - Better now.
I think your decision to
go to London is right.
It's the only way.
You're taking him to London?
All of them. The situation
is delicate and...
...I can't prolong my stay anymore.
Doctor, the referral...
Excuse me.
I'll give you a letter for Dr. Caine.
Koel...
Girish, has the doctor left, son?
Yes.
Shekhar, when did you come?
Listen... - Yes...
Has he taken the morning capsule?
Yes. When is the next dose?
At night, with milk.
But the milk's over.
Don't worry, I'll get more.
Do you need anything else?
No. But tell the milkman to not
come from tomorrow. - Ok.
And... the tickets aren't
here yet either.
Sir, tickets. Please sign here.
When did you return, son?
The tickets are here?
Can you believe your uncle's state? All our
hopes lie with the doctors in London now.
Are Lolita and Girish...?
Yes. Your uncle wished it.
And men like Girish are rare.
Mother, please come here.
Coming.
Shekhar. Shekhar.
Thank God, you're here.
Everything will be fine now.
Right?
I can't believe you sold out like this.
Shekhar. - Oh, please.
Women like you...
What do 'respectable' people
like you call us?
Prostitutes, right?
Whores.
Your father's words, not yours.
And you're just like him.
If you ever utter a word against him...
...l'll kill you... you...
Night, o' ambassador of black.
Night, o' envoy of dark.
The moon's mate, o' night,
you come to me forlorn.
An era has passed since
we met last, and yet,
you come alone?
The mood is solemn...
...only the crickets mourn.
The moon's mate, o' night,
you come to me forlorn.
Where is your friend,
the elusive moon;
why do you come alone?
Extinguish the twilight,
eclipse the dark...
...I only wish to speak
to the pitch in the black.
The night is sad...
...it's heavy with grief...
...sitting in its own dark shadow.
The moon's mate, o' night,
you come to me forlorn.
An era has passed since we met last,
and yet, you come alone?
Extinguish the twilight,
eclipse the dark...
...I only wish to speak
to the pitch in the black.
You're here?
We're leaving tonight...
You have no business
with anyone here.
Please give this key to Shekhar.
Brother... Shekhar.
Shekhar. Koel. - Enough. Leave.
You've got your hands
on a treasure chest...
...what do you need this key for?
The darkness is maddening,
opaque and dense.
It pricks, it stings;
it's a welcome offence.
I seek its lap
to end my day...
...I join its embrace
to veil my dismay.
Like my black renegade kohl,
it streams down my face.
The moon's mate, o' night,
you come to me forlorn.
Where is your friend,
the elusive moon,
why do you come alone?
Extinguish the twilight,
eclipse the dark...
...I only wish to speak
to the pitch in the black.
The night is sad...
...it's heavy with grief...
- Let's go, Lolita.
...sitting in its own dark shadow.
Not a musician...
Just a businessman.
Uncle Raghu...
Son. - Yes, mother.
Some bad news...
Mr. Gurucharan is no more.
The wedding happened quickly
to fulfill his last wish.
Is it over?
Yes. Girish managed everything.
They'll be here next week
for the last rites.
What's happening to you, son?
Is everything okay?
Tell Mr. Tantiya I'm ready to
marry his daughter Gayatri.
Wonderful, son. I'll call them
first thing tomorrow morning.
Come on, Rajeshwari.
Have you composed this?
No. It's Tagore's, stupid.
Hello, Shekhar. Congratulations.
Here to just congratulate me?
I'm also here to give you
a parcel from Lolita.
What's this?
The papers to their house.
Why are you giving it to me?
Consider it your wedding gift.
Tell her I don't want her charity.
Not charity - a debt.
She said she'll never be able
to pay you back completely.
...but she's trying.
Your wife's become pretty smart.
Yes. And I really love her.
Isn't this the tune you two sang?
Day and night.
It made me insanely jealous
as to how someone
could love so much.
But marriage cured me.
My clever wife cured me my Koel.
Koel?
I know what you're thinking,
and rightly so.
I loved Lolita very much...
but when I proposed to her
...she said she was already married.
I asked her but she didn't tell
me her husband's name.
...But she never so miserable
...not even to Koel.
But when she gave you
the house, I knew.
The money you had given her
turned into a debt the day you...
...decided to marry Gayatri.
This debt will become a burden for her.
And she won't bear this burden...
A burden she wasn't willing to carry.
That's who she is.
I wanted to find that foolish man
and drag him to her feet.
But you... you're not even worthy
of her feet. I pity you, Shekhar.
You lost what was already yours.
You're the most unfortunate soul
in the world.
When are you all leaving?
- Right now.
What have I done?
What do I do...?
Shekhar.
Ask daddy dearest.
Why was Girish here?
What is this?
The papers of the house.
He was here to make this deal?
How much does he want?
Mr. Tantiya will be delighted.
Hello? Mr. Tantiya, please?
Good news, Mr. Tantiya...
we've got the house.
We're just leaving for your house.
My son has accomplished
what I couldn't.
Behold. Mr. Gurucharan's house papers.
Thank God, it's yours now.
Or else God knows how many more
lives would've been destroyed.
The house that killed Mr. Gurucharan
got Lolita...
...fired with such indignity created
a wall between two families...
Rajeshwari. Be quiet.
Thank God, it's yours now.
What is so wrong?
He couldn't repay so I kept the house.
You gave him the money
knowing fully well he'd...
...never be able to repay.
It's business.
And I'm a businessman.
A very bad one.
Such a profitless deal.
Why? What's the price?
It's free... but too expensive for you.
You've got everything.
...an empire, fame...
and now this house too.
But nobody is poorer than you today...
...because you got the house...
...but you've lost your son.
You've gone mad.
You're going to be wed in a while.
Mr. Tantiya is expecting us...
...Ask him... will he wed his
daughter to a married man?
What? - Yes.
I'm already married.
To whom?
Lolita.
Really, son? When?
I don't consider it a marriage.
Give her some money and...
Enough. My wife is not for sale.
Your mind is governed only
by money, isn't it, dad?
And I feel sorry that
I was following your path.
You poisoned my mind so deeply;
I saw everything through your eyes.
I was reduced to business, deals,
money just like you...
I even raised my hand on my wife.
Stop it, son.
Where are you going?
To be a good husband
and bring my wife home.
You won't go anywhere.
Where are you going, son?
What's overcome him?
Shekhar.
Shekhar.
Shekhar.
Break it, Shekhar.
Break it.
Ajit, stop him.
Break it, Shekhar. Break it.
Break it, damn it.
Break it, Shekhar. Break it.
Stop watching the circus and
stop him. Call the police.
Break it, Shekhar. Break it.
What is this commotion?
- I'll check.
Rajeshwari.
Break it, son. Destroy it forever.
Here, light these.
Light up the whole house.
My daughter-in-law is home.
Yes, tonight is Shekhar's wedding night.
Just a few players have changed.
And the city's dreams and
joys have returned.
Calcutta is once again a city of joy.
