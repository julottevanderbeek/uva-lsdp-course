We’re going to be late
I can’t go any quicker
Stop it!
Come on!
Richard B. Starkey and his aunt, Jessica
are always arguing about one thing or another
I'm going...
Go on!
And what with today being Sunday
and the weather looking up…
you’d think they’d have given it a rest
Will you stop that sitting down?
All right, all right.
What’s your hurry?
But no. On and on they go
Good morning,
said Richard
“Good Afternoon, sir,”
said the courier
They were late.
Good Morning, ladies
and gentlemen, boys and girls
Welcome to the
Magical Mystery Tour!
I am your courier...
Jolly Jimmy Johnson!
- All my friends call me Jolly Jimmy
- And you are all my friends
Over here is your hostess,
that lovely, delightful, delectable
Wendy Winters
And over here is our driver for the trip
- that wonderful driver
we hope…
Alf!
Off you go, Alf
Fasten your seat belts please
Away, way, way we go
Get the popcorns out.
Right had arm. There we are.
Splendid
Anyway, I’ll tell you something
You ain’t coming away with me anymore
I bought the tickets for the trip
Yeah, with my money
I bought them.
I’m taking you out.
I gave you the money, darling
You’ve done nothing but eye all
the fellows on the coach
since we got here
Since Uncle Jack died,
you’ve never been the same.
Of course I ain’t, ‘cause I ain’t got
Uncle Jack, Have I?
I gotta get somebody else, haven’t I?
Do a bit of knitting,
It’d do you good.
Who for?  You?
Should I knit for you?
No, don’t knit for me
Who is that man?
Oh, that’s Mr. Bloodvessel
He’s quite harmless.
He comes on all the trips
He thinks he’s the courier
Last time he thought
he was the driver
You know when I saw your first film,
I really thought you had something
Wasn’t it “Blue Lady”? “LADY IN BLUE”
Something like that?
Excuse me, sir...
I’d like to take a photograph
of the young lady
Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
Well on his way
Head in a cloud
The man with a thousand voices
talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hear him
or the sound he appears to make
and he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
And nobody seems to like him
they can tell what he wants to do
and he never shows his feeling
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
And he never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him
The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning 'round
Good morning,
lads and lasses
My name is Miss Winters
Good morning, Miss Winters
Miss Winters, Miss Winters
If there’s anything
I can do for you…
you know what to do...
We at the Magical Mysteries
only have your best interest at heart
thank you...
As the bus leaves the town
behind and heads for the country…
Everything begins to change
Well, almost everything
Already the magic is beginning to work
Jolly good...
Why?
Why?
Why?
Jolly good, Sarge, carry on...
On your marks!
If you look to your left,
ladies and gentlemen
the view is not very inspiring
But if you look to the right…
Beyond the blue horizon
for above the clouds…
in a land that no one knows…
Live four or five magicians…
Who spend their days
casting wonderful spells
Come with me now
into that secret place…
Where the eyes of man
have never set foot
Where’s the bus?
Where’s the bus?
Where’s the bus?
It’s coming
Where’s the bus?
The bus...
The bus is ten miles north
on the Jewsbury Road
It’s only ten miles away.
ten miles!...
Ladies and gentlemen,
quickly, look to your left
Now there you see
the ancient Roman ruins
They really have been
there an awful long time
They are, in fact,
a little difficult to see
because they’re almost
flattened to the ground
Meanwhile, back on the bus,
things are happening
Indeed, the magic
is so powerful
that even Mr. Bloodvessel
emerges from his shell
He turns to speak
If I may the liberty, Mister
Be my guest
My dear lady...
My dear lady, doesn’t intuition
tell you what I feel?
Don’t interrupt...
You bring out my…
I...
I love you!!
I am the courier
good morning... men...
and... women...
welcome...
I am your friendly courier
Mr Bllodvessel is my name
Buster Bloodvessel
I am concerned for you
to enjoy yourselves…
Within the limits
of British decency
You know what I mean
don’t you?
Well, don’t you?
Yes, Mr. Bloodvessel
I am he as you are he
as you are me
and we are all together
See how they run
like pigs from a gun
see how they fly
I'm crying
Sitting on a cornflake
waiting for the van to come
Corporation t-shirts,
stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy,
you let your face grow long
I am the eggman
they are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Mister City P'liceman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly
like Lucy in the Sky
see how they run
I'm crying
I'm cry
Yellow matter custard
dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife,
pornographic priestess
Boy, you been a naughty girl
and you let your knickers down
I am the eggman
they are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Sitting in an English garden
waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come,
you get a tan from
Standing in the English rain
I am the eggman
they are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Expert texpert
choking smokers
Don't you think
the joker laughs at you?
See how they smile
like pigs in a sty
see how they snide
I'm crying
Semolina Pilchard
climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin
singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them
kicking Edgar Allan Poe
I am the eggman
they are the eggmen
I am the walrus
I’ve got a present for you,
do you know what it is?
no
Have a guess
no
Come on, have a guess
no
Have a guess
no
Have a guess!
no!
Well, you’re going to get it anyway
What's that?
Do you want to blow it?
no
All right,
should we give it to George?
yes
Thank you
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention please?
Our estimated time of arrival for luncheon
is approximately one fifteen
thank you
Now, shut up
Shut up to me!
I’ve had enough of it!
I can’t stand it any more!
I’m getting off!
Don’t get hysterical
Aunt Jessie’s hungry
And she’s dreaming
She’s dreaming about food
food
food
Beautiful food
lettuces...
potatoes...
apples...
food
oh lovely food
Lots and lots of spaghetti
This time I mean it
I can’t breathe anymore
It’s too much
All this mud
in forty-five minutes?
I can hardly get my breath
It’s intake, Jessie
not output
I am, I am!
I am already
Three times this week already
For goodness sake
Jessie, sit down
remember...
I don’t care!
This is the way
he would have wanted it
Penendello,
help me up the stairs
Wake up, Jessie
It’s time to go
Here we are again!
Everybody up quickly
There's a fog upon L.A.
And my friends
have lost their way
We'll be over soon they said
Now they've lost
themselves instead
Please don't be long
please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
or I may be asleep
Well it only goes to show
Ask a policeman on the street
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet
Please don't be long
please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
or I may be asleep
Now it's past my bed I know
And I'd really like to go
Soon will be the break of day
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way
Please don't be long
please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
or I may be asleep
Please don't be long
please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
Well, well, well
They are a happy crowd
Come on, come on
Back on the bus...
come on
Oh! I wonder what the magicians
are cooking up now?
Talk about your magical mysteries…
I spent half an hour
looking for that sugar
I spent half an hour
looking for that sugar
Is there one for me?
There’s one over here, Richie
Oh, how are you, Bonzo?
Any news of the bus?
The bus is ten miles north
on the Jewsbury Road
And they’re having a lovely time
they’re having a lovely time
they’re having a lovely time
Could you tell me
what’s next on the agenda?
A Song
No, no
not you
Them!
On the bus!
Join in.
What’s the matter with you?
Ladies and gentlemen,
when the coach stops,
would the gentlemen
please follow Mr. Johnson?
The ladies stay with me
That night Cutie called a cab

She left her East Side room so drab

She went out on the town
Knowin' it would
make her lover frown
Death-cab for Cutie
Death-cab for Cutie

from green to red
They tried to stop
but they both wound up dead
Death-cab for Cutie
Death-cab for Cutie

Someone's gonna make
you pay your fare
