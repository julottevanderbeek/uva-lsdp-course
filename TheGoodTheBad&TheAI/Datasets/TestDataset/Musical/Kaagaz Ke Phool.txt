Yes, he is entering
a film studio.
Wonder how many films
have been made in this studio.
Many are made, and how many
more will continue to be made.
But this studio has not changed.
And neither have
the surroundings.
Everything is the same.
Only the films and the ones
who make them, keep changing.
There was a time when he
used to also make films here.

Madam, Mr. Sinha has walked in
at the second chime.
The second number
must win today!
Shame!
I've composed a superb tune. Sir
chose it as soon as he heard it!
It's composed for the scene...
...when Devdas is going
on a bullock cart.
Okay, sing it.
As you wish.
It's in perfect harmony.
The pace of the
bullock cart will be slow.
And equally slow will be
the rhythm of my tune.
Slow... real slow.
Stop that and sing the tune.
As you wish.
There were no lyrics...
...so I have used
some rubbish...
Sir... as you wish.
Suresh will
never make such a mistake.
And why do you forget that
you are enacting Paro's role?
The heroine of Devdas.
Isn't that enough?
- Enough? Of course, it is!
- Very much so!
Mr. Sinha will not give me
silk saris for this role.
I cannot apply make-up
or adorn my tresses!
Would I look like
a heroine or a nag then?
It's one and the same.
What were you saying?
Kanta absolutely despises
the role of Paro.
I mean, make the character
a little more glamourous.
Please! For my sake!
You will have to change
as per the character.
The character will not
change for you!
Don't change it much.
I want a beauty spot here...
...and a few ringlets.
- Not even one!
- Not even a stylish hairdo?
No. You have to be very simple.
Then, I' m sorry, I will
not work in this film!
You are being unfair.
She can have a stylish hairdo.
Yes.
If you want a stylish hairdo...
...then get the film made
by somebody else!
What!
Your hairdo will remain simple!
I deeply regret, but your
hairdo will remain simple.
Good-day, sir.

Daddy, when did you come
from Bombay? Just now?
Yes, dear.
You had not seen my father,
right?
Do one thing.
Lock me in the museum here...
...so that your friends can
see me to their heart's content.
Pammi, you also go.
Pammi also? Why?
I' m sorry, you cannot meet Pammi.
These are her mother's orders.
But she is my daughter too.
But you are not her guardian.
Her mother has enrolled her
in our school.
We cannot disobey her orders.
Who?
You appear a bit perturbed,
seeing me here.
Good conduct is followed in
this house rigidly. Please sit.
Lulu's voice appears a bit
feeble. Does it have a cold?
Meet Rita, Suresh.
The new member of our family.
Actually, I have come to meet
another member of your family.
Your daughter.
Tell my daughter that...
...her husband
conveys his regards to her.
I am coming from Dehradun.
As per your orders, I was
not allowed to meet Pammi.
I am sure, dear, that Lulu has
caught a cold. Or its voice...
I have been feeding
it brandy day and night.
Goodbye.
Madam says that
she will not meet you.
How is the weather in Mumbai?
I have not come to
discuss the weather.
I want to decide something
regarding Pammi.
You have wasted your time.
We had decided that years ago.
Years ago, your daughter left
my house out of her choice.
But now, why are you forcefully
snatching away Pammi from me?
Now? You forget that Pammi's
been staying with her mother...
...since years.
That's because a small child
always needs its mother.
But now, my daughter
will stay with me.
Will Sir B.B. Verma's grandchild
live...
...in a wretched world of films?
There must be nobody
as unfortunate as us, Suresh.
Living in a high society,
we feel ashamed to say...
...our girl is married.
As then, people ask us
what her husband does.
Why didn't we learn
before the wedding...
...that someday, you'd join
the world of films?
I don't understand! I ask, why
do you consider it to be so bad?
Look, Suresh, only good things
are mentioned in this house.
Nothing bad is spoken!
Speak about something else.
Then, listen to my final words.
Nobody can snatch Pammi from me.
Neither you nor your daughter.
The doors of the Court are open
to everyone. Try your luck.
What! You want to take
familial matters to Court?
Familial? I have implicit trust
in the justice of the British.
I don't want to argue with you.
I' II settle matters
only with Beena.
This is the best formula to cure
the headache you get in this zoo
The best prescription - brandy!
First listen to
the dosages prescribed.
If you want to meet
the old man, have one drop.
If you want to meet the
old woman, have two drops.
And if you want to meet Beena...
...then a whole bottle
also will not suffice.
She declined to meet me.
Ask Rocky what it is to spend
your life with these women!
You come only once a year.
Look at me. I am 35 years
and 4 months old.
But I have spent
How is Jimmy feeling?
He's okay now. The doctor
has fed it plenty of grams.
Jimmy seems quite healthy.
Dr. Singh's treatment is amazing!
Where is Dr. Singh?
I was asking for Dr. Singh.
The one with a shirt,
not the one with a blouse.
I am Dr. Singh's daughter.
If you are Mr. Rakesh, then
I' m very pleased to meet you.
This is not a horse's hand.
Well, where is your 'pap'?
He isn't here today.
I have treated Jimmy.
You did?!
Yes. And I will have to come for
some days as papa is not well.
That's really nice!
I mean, you coming. Jimmy started
recovering the moment you came.
And I... never mind!
Your papa has typhoid, which
lasts for 40 days, right?
No! He has a cold,
which lasts for 2 days!
Even then he can't visit
the stable.
Suppose the horses sneeze, then?
Fool!
Have you caught a cold?
I mean, the weather
is quite strange.
Excuse me, but are you mute?
It's futile asking my name.
I' II be eating
at the hostel this evening.
I don't like watching films!
- What!
- Yes!
But why are you telling me
all this?
Because this is what I have
heard about gentlemen nowadays!
If they meet a girl alone,
then...
...number one, it's hello.
Number two, it's the weather.
Number three, ask her name.
Number four, invite her
for lunch or a film.
- Number five...
- That's enough.
Then, I am half a gentleman.
Do not fear. I do not go
beyond number two.
- Really?
- Absolutely.
I' m so sorry, I misunderstood...
Number one, cold.
Number two, it's so chilly.
Why didn't you bring your coat?
One gets a cold for free.
But one needs money
for a warm coat.
- Take this.
- You...
Take.
- But what about you?
- I won't catch a cold.
I've had a little brandy.
You have had alcohol?
I believe, people really
misbehave after having alcohol.
Some people drink to forget
how others misbehave.
Really?
Hey! I forgot, I had to catch
a train to Mumbai in 20 minutes.
Excuse me!
Hey, fool! Have you brought an
extra or somebody from the road?!
If you repeat this,
I shall not spare you!
Make do this time.
The next time...
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.
The background lighting
is ready.
Mount the camera on the crane
and get it till here.
Do the lighting, and I' II come.
Hey, you! All the extras have
gone to the sets...
...and you' re still here!
I' II leave now.
Take care of the baby.
I ask, why didn't you go?!
...Why don't you answer?
The child was wailing as it
was hungry, so I was feeding it.
If you don't have time
from your child...
...then why have you
come to work!
Yes, sir?
There is no need to hurry.
Put the child to sleep
and report to the sets.
Yes, sir.
Come here, dear.
What's your name?
Take this.
What do you want?
Is there a film director,
Mr. Sinha, in this company?
- I was waiting for you.
- The shooting rushes have come.
Book a theatre
during lunch break.
Where did she come from?
Hey, which fool made this woman
stand in the middle?
There's a coat in this.
Yes. During the rains...
I mean, in Delhi.
You had given it to me
under the banyan tree.
Yes! Have you come here
to return the coat?
Yes... No! I came to Mumbai
in search of a job.
I found your card and address
in the coat, so I came here.
I see. Let me take the shot first
I' II speak to you after that.
Gupta, give her a chair.
Get the clapperboard.
Bring the crane down.
- Print number 10 and 11.
- Okay, sir.
Sir, the girl who had come...
Oh yes! Where is she?
She has left. She's left this
coat and letter in your name.
My spectacles.
Please read this.
What have you done?
Why did you print this shot?
Wait. Let it go.
I needed just this kind
of a face for Paro's role.
Fetch this girl wherever
she is. Immediately!
But if I don't know her name and
address, then in this big city...
If you don't know, then find
every nook and corner of the city.
Spread the news,
and in the newspapers...
Walk a little.
Show your profile.
Please smile a little.
Her teeth must be spoilt!
Madam, why do you look
so gloomy?!
Have you come here to become a
heroine...
...or to mourn for somebody?!
Lady, becoming a heroine
is no child's play!
If you can't show your teeth,
then deliver a line.
Repeat after me...
What!
I cannot act! I...
I will not become an actress.
I will not.
Did you hear?
Why do you want to push her
into becoming a heroine?
The girl is okay to look at,
but she has a very plain face.
The face should be lively too.
But she just does not
know how to smile!
She could not repeat
what I said.
Make her a heroine
in a silent film!
She will not become a heroine!
I have made up my mind!
Gupta, apply make-up for the
girl and bring her to the sets.
What!
Decide whatever you have to,
after the test.
Am I the owner of
this company or is he?
You are, undoubtedly!
What I would always imagine...
...you are exactly that way!
My eyes were searching for
someone just like you...
...since a long time.
What?
The same simplicity
and innocence.
You are indeed Paro.
Pardon? My name is Shanti.
Yes, the one whom you had
given your coat to.
Paro must be somebody else.
Yes. Paro is Devdas' heroine.
The role that
I want to give you.
But you have seen that your
companions have failed me.
It' II be good if you forgive me.
I will not be able to act.
I am happy the way I am.
What do you do?
I have quite a big job.
I get Rs.90 at Modern Chemist.
Just Rs.10 less than 100!
Do you know what you will get
working for our company?
- One...
- Thousand.
- You will act now, won't you?
- Just wait.
at the most, I' II need 150.
The rest? No way!
What will a lone girl
do with so much of money?
Alone? What about your
parents or relatives?
I have a distant
maternal uncle...
...who has always remained
distant from me.
I was raised in an orphanage.
What about your studies then?
I used to knit sweaters
to buy my books.
My fingers would be
on the needles...
...and my eyes, on the books. This
way, I passed my matriculation.
Yes?
The more I get to know you,
the more I get certain.
You will be a perfect Paro.
Do you trust me so much?
I cannot express how much.
Believe me, you will
be a perfect Paro.
Can you trust me?
It's quite strange.
For the first time in life...
...I trust somebody else
more than myself.
Take this. These are
Paro's dialogues.
I say, hello.
My Jimmy will win this race.
Rakesh, meet my new heroine.
You already know her.
He hails from
a very high society.
Not very high.
Just 5 feet 8 inches tall.
I meant, Mr. Rakesh
is married to wealth.
Oh no! I hate the word marriage.
You see,
I want to die a bachelor!
Where are you staying
in Mumbai? With friends?
At the Taj. Since the time I've
left Delhi...
...I've been moving freely.
There comes my freedom!
She is the Health Officer
of all my children.
How many children do you have?
I had 8 last year, and 12 now.
Twelve?!
Five red, and five black.
He has four legged
children with tails.
One of them will be
participating in this race.
What a child!
Cruel man! You have come to
Mumbai, and not even phoned me!
It's time for the race.
I' II leave.
Mr. Sinha.
You?
Come here.
A hairdo? Show me your hand.
These nails!
Eyebrows shaped! I ask,
what is all this?!
Well... for this party, she...
I see!
So now, you are more interested
in parties than your work.
I never expected you
to get swayed so soon...
...by the razzmatazz here!
Mr. Sinha.
Mr. Sinha. Please listen to me.
Listen indeed! Your shooting
will be held tomorrow.
You have to become Paro.
An innocent, simple Indian girl.
How can I shoot with that
wild creeper on your head?!
It won't straighten for 10 days!
But I didn't know that
this appearance would be...
You probably think that
you look very beautiful!
You look like a monkey
right now!
- What?
- Yes!
You have messed up a
lovely, innocent face!
Before getting misled
by anyone...
...you should have
at least asked me!
Your simplicity held
so much... so much of charisma.
- What?
- Of course! Am I joking?!
I had heard of an ugly duckling
turning into a swan.
But for the first time...
...I've seen a swan turning
into an ugly duckling!
Go and enjoy your party!
- Just see if
they are ready or not. - Okay.
- Is it okay?
- Absolutely.
How did you manage to
straighten them so soon?
I was busy with it
the whole night.
The whole night?
Didn't you sleep?
No. You had said that I am more
interested in parties...
...than my work.
- I said that only...
- Everything is ready.
I scolded you a lot
last night, didn't I?
You called me a monkey.
I wonder
why I scolded you so much.
I have never reprimanded
any heroine like that before.
Nobody else?
I would get angry with them, but
lacked the courage to scold them
Shall I say why?
Because you are decent.
- Really?
- Yes.
No decent man can shout
at a woman who is not his own.
What are you thinking about?
You must have felt
quite offended yesterday.
No. Henceforth, I will never
feel offended if you scold me.
I understand quite a lot now.
What do you understand?
That you are...
you are like a walnut!
Hard on the surface,
but soft from within.
"Rustles the wind"
"It whispers to us"
"New desires awaken"
"It will keep bluffing us"
"Fragrant is my mind"

"My heart wishes to fly"
"Excited it is
It does not listen to me"
"This wind..."
"...torments us"
"It's breathtaking"
"This breeze drives us crazy"
Yes, she is here.
Madam... madam.
Let me sleep.
It's 11.30. There's a
trunk call from Mumbai.
What! Suresh has met
with an accident?
I am sorry to hear about it.
How's he?
If he needs me, then send him
here immediately by plane.
He will be completely
attended to, here.
What?
No, I cannot come there.
I told you, I cannot come there.
It's impossible.
What happened?
Won't Mrs. Sinha come?
No.
Surprising!
At such a time, if someone close
to Mr. Sinha...
...could stay with him, then...
Anyway, a nurse will remain
with him 24 hours a day.
I've given him
a morphine injection.
- Let him rest for 10-12 hours.
- Very well.
- Let's go.
- Yes.
Nurse, phone me as soon as
Mr. Sinha regains consciousness.
- Should I reach you home?
- No.
I have called for a taxi.
Carry on. I' II go on my own.
Okay.
Water.
Water.
- Where were you, nurse?
- I was...
I hate to be dependent
on others.
But these eyes...
Right now, there is nobody else
other than you to look after me.
- Is it raining outside?
- Yes.
Let me stay in this room.
I love the sound of the rains.
It was raining
the other day too.
And the poor girl
didn't even have a coat.
Nurse, how is Shanti?
She was also with me
in that accident.
I am still with you.
Who's it?
Yes.
You are perfectly okay,
aren't you?
Yes, I am. Have some water.
Oh yes! How did you know
that I was thirsty?
It's been more than 13 hours
since you have had water.
And I know that you are used
to drinking water every 2 hours.
Where are the servants?
They are sleeping. It's 2 a.m.
It's quite late at night. Ask
the driver to reach you home.
You aren't asking me
to stay back?
I want...
I don't want you to undergo
any trouble because of me.
Then, ask me not to leave.
No. It's better that you do.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Hey, she's come!
Why are you laughing?
Praises have been showered about
your father in this magazine.
Really? What's written?
- Shall I read it?
- Yes. Why do you even ask?
Let's read it for her.
Renowned director Suresh Sinha
has chosen a new heroine...
...for his film.
It's said that this girl
used to sell medicines earlier.
And is now curing
Mr. Sinha's heart ailment.
One hopes that Mr. Sinha
has taken full advantage...
...of her therapeutic expertise.
...What does it mean?
My father is not like that!
You have always lived
away from him.
So how would you know
what he's like?
I know! I know
everything about him!
If you do, then tell us which
film he is directing nowadays.
I... I do not know.
- What is his new heroine's name?
- I do not know that either.
- Why doesn't your mother
live with him? - I do not know!
Do you know
your dad's name or not?
What! What did you say?
I' II kill you!
I' II kill you if you speak ill
about my father!
Nobody has yet come
to the studio.
Why have you come so early?
Even you have come very early.
I have a habit of coming a few
hours before shooting begins...
I know.
Really? What else
do you know about me?
Everything.
Perhaps, that's why you did not
come to inquire about me...
...after that night.
You had asked me not to.
I had asked you to leave.
I didn't prevent you
from coming the next day.
So, you wanted me to come?
Whom are you knitting
the sweater for?
There is someone.
Mr. Someone or Miss Someone.
Mr. Someone.
But you had once said that
you have nobody in this world.
Then, how did this someone...
He is just like me... all alone.
Perhaps you do not know
that I have a family.
I know.
"What a sweet calamity
has befallen us"
"We are no more the same"
"Restless hearts united..."
"...As if they were
never apart"
"We both are lost..."
"...on the same path"
"What a sweet calamity
has befallen us"
"We are no more the same"
"Don't know where to go"
"Tried to walk away,
But no destination"
"Don't know what is my goal"
"Hearts weave dreams"
"What a sweet calamity
has befallen us"
"We are no more the same"
Didn't you hear what mother said?
Your stables in Mumbai...
- Look at this!
- I' II leave, pop.
Strange man! Only half
his face has a beard.
Look, what's written below.
It's the picture
of film personalities.
Film personalities!
You wanted to say something.
- About horses.
- About horses!
Rocky,
at your Mumbai stables...
I am quite sure that I have
seen this man somewhere.
Who, papa?
The one whose photo is
in this newspaper.
You see him everyday. In fact,
you are seeing him even now.
The moustache and the beard
have been drawn with a pencil.
Why did you leave
the job incomplete?
It's your photograph!
It's such a shame, papa!
Suresh is not concerned about
our family's honour...
...as he is an outsider.
But now, even a son from this
family is heading towards films!
My son! I cannot believe it!
Mom, answer papa.
First, you answer me.
How did you land up
with those cheap film people?!
In a taxi.
Firstly, Sir B.B. Verma's son went
to cheap film personalities...
...and that too,
in an ordinary taxi!
What they must be
thinking about us?
They do not think about us.
Look at the way Rocky
is looking at this actress.
Even Suresh used to look at me
that way before marriage.
Suresh was wise
before he got married.
It's a family matter.
Let it remain in stock.
I' II take it back
some other time.
Who are you?
He is my father.
- Your?
- Daddy.
Why have you put up only
my father's photograph here?
Why are you quiet? Answer me.
Whose photograph will I put up
then?
I have no relative or friend.
Implying, my father means
everything to you?
When did you come from school?
Will you be staying
with your father?
Answer my question first!
And then, I will answer yours.
What... what answer do I give?
- You are still a child.
- I am not a child!
I have run away from school
and come to you.
Can a child do this?!
Run away?
You should not have done this.
Why have you run away
and come here?
- To fight with you.
- Fight?
I see. Go ahead.
But how can you fight well
after a tiresome journey?
Freshen up and have some sweets.
I will not have any sweets!
Do not deceive me!
I know that you don't love me!
- How do you know?
- You are mother's rival!
Then, how can you love
her daughter?
You are your father's daughter
too.
And, my dear, I hold no animosity
towards your mother.
You are lying! You are snatching
my father away from my mother!
But I will not let
this happen, understand?!
You misunderstand, Pammi.
They have been living separately
much before I came here.
That's because I was small.
But I have become sensible now.
If I try,
then they could be united.
But that will never happen
as long as you are here!
I think you misunderstand me.
Then why have you hung such
a big picture of dad? Answer me!
I told you I am not a child.
I understand everything.
My foot,
you understand everything!
If your parents live separately,
I am not to be blamed...
...your mother is!
Who are you to speak ill
about my mother?!
Whatever transpires in our
house, is a personal matter.
What right do you have, to
interfere in other's lives?!
Then, neither do you have a
right to interfere in mine!
After being subjected to
cruel fate all my life...
...I have acquired little
happiness...
...for the first time in life.
It may be incomplete,
but it means everything to me.
I cannot lose it at any cost!
You have no parents.
But I do.
There is mother's house
and father's too.
And the hostel is my house.
All three of us
have separate homes.
My endeavours were to bring
the three of us to live together
But you will not let this happen.
What do you know about living
like an orphan...
...in spite of having parents?!
