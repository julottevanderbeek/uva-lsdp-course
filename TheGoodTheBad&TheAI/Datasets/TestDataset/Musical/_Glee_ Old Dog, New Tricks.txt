Glee.
Funny Girl
I'm a little jealous,
but I'm not resentful.
Glee.
KURT: Hey, do any of you guys
want to catch a matinee tomorrow?
I have a late shift at the diner
and I know is dark.
SANTANA: Uh, "dark" as in
there are no performances,
or "dark" as in it's
kind of a downer.
RACHEL: Oh, my word. I'm
sorry, I-I would love to go,
but June's got me taken up with
dinners and rehearsals...
Yeah, I know. Count me out.
I'm gonna be at recording studio all day.
This is terrible... look what I
just found on Broadwaybuzzard.com.
SANTANA:
I'll take that.
"Blind Item!
Liar, Liar Fanny on Fire!
- Shh.
- "What Broadway starlet
"has been calling in sick
"while secretly pursuing
other job opportunities?
"Unnamed sources say
producers are none too happy
"with the burgeoning diva's
shenanigans,
"and wager that this starlet
will burn out faster
"than you can say
'Milwaukee Dinner Theatre
in the Round!'"
I missed show.
Rachel, you should
actually be glad
that they don't know
you're seriously considering
leaving your show
to do a TV pilot.
This is terrible, okay?
I cannot be branded
a problem child
this early in my career.
I-I might be ambitious,
but I'm not a bad person.
You can't expect total strangers
to know exactly who you are.
I mean, look at Angelina
Jolie... she used to be
that girl with the vial of blood
around her neck
who liked kissing her brother,
and now she's mother earth.
How'd she do it?
Two things...
publicist and a cause.
BLAINE: She can't afford a publicist.
And always been my cause.
KURT: Inside voice, honey.
Sorry.
Well, you don't need a publicist
when you've got Snixx
on your side.
If there's one thing
I know about,
it's cultivating an image.
In high school,
I was a huge bitch,
but also most popular.
I was voted
Best Shoulder to Cry On
and Most Likely to Poison Someone.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, miss,
I know that you have
a dog in your purse.
It's a... service animal.
I would seriously think that
zipping a Seeing Eye dog
in your bag would hinder it
from doing its job.
You know, there are so many dogs
out there that need good homes,
and you're just treating it
like some fashion accessory?
You should be ashamed
of yourself!
Screw you...
God, people are
just unbelievable.
I think I just found my cause.
Can I get you a menu?
I was wondering if your boss
would mind putting up a poster.
Uh, tell him
if he decides not to, that I'm
gonna accuse him of elder abuse.
Uh, "The Lexington Home
for Retired Performers
presents
Yeah, we thought
we'd take a shot at it.
Well, in case
NBC casts Clay Aiken
and it's ruined for good.
You know, I won't even ask him;
I'll put it up in the window.
Hey, Pillsbury,
why the long face?
You look like
the saddest dough boy
in the world.
Oh, I wouldn't want to bother
you with any of my problems.
I usually just file it all away,
and then wait for an episode
of
to let it all out.
Are you sure?
KURT:
in my life has moved on
to something except for me.
When did I become the mother
in a Nancy Meyers movie?
I mean, all they need me for
is to remind them how talented
and beautiful they are...
it's like they don't care.
I care.
I can't tell you how nice it is
to talk to someone
without them texting
in the middle
of the conversation.
Oh, I know exactly how you feel.
Most of my friends can't hear.
Mm. I'm Kurt, by the way.
Maggie Banks.
Wait a second.
D-Did I just have
a therapy session
with-with Maggie Banks,
the-the Broadway legend?
You were in one of the biggest
Broadway flops in history.
Well, in my defense,
the talk of the town.
"She can't hear
or see, but she has
a voice of gold."
Now, that was a tagline.
Looks like my ride is here.
How did you boys
find me so fast?
Actually, you dropped
a couple of posters, Maggie...
we're just following the trail.
Yeah, 18 blocks...
it's a new record.
Well, has to advertise.
It was nice
to talk to you, Pillsbury.
You, too.
And if you don't have
any plans...
and it would seem
that you don't...
come and visit us in rehearsal.
I would love to, Maggie. Thanks.
Good.
See ya.
Okay, guys.
Can I drive today?
RACHEL: So they really just
stay in these cages all day?
MAN: Oh, no, we give
them five walks a day.
We take them to a dog run
for two hours of exercise
every other day...
we really do our best,
given the limited
funding that we have.
You got to remember, these are rescue
dogs, you know? Most of these dogs have
been living on the streets, or
they were abandoned, abused...
RACHEL: Oh...
MERCEDES: So... you know,
what happens
to them eventually?
Well, it depends on how old they
are, really. We try to get as many
of them adopted as we can, but
when we can't, not much choice.
You know, it's...
it's the worst part of my job.
RACHEL: Well, that's why
we're here, actually.
We want to arrange
a very public
a-and great event
for a cause that
we are so passionate
about: animals.
Yeah, you said something about Broadway?
Yes. I am starring currently
in the acclaimed
Broadway revival of
I don't know if you've seen it. I
don't really get into the city much.
I'm not a Broadway guy. But I liked Cats.
Okay,
well, it doesn't really matter,
you know... we just want
to spearhead a benefit,
guided towards the Broadway
community... aka me...
I got it, I got it.
Okay, well, you know,
we'll take care
of everything, um...
- Okay. That's great.
- Really?
Yeah, I'm in for sure.
- Yeah?
- I'm in. Yeah.
I'll get the information
together; let's do it.
Okay. Amazing. Thank you.
We love you.
Hi.
We should get one.
Look at you. Ooh.
Oh, no. Sam, I love animals,
but I've got my hands
full taking care of you.
You're more than enough.
: It happens sometimes.
Uh, it's no big deal.
When they get like this,
I pipe music in
through the P.A. system,
but it's all busted now, so...
Today's your lucky day... I just
read John Mayer's bio, and he
said you always have to have
your guitar 80% of the time.
Moving forward,
using all my breath
Making love to you
was never second best
And I saw the world
Crashing
all around your face
Never really knowing
it was always
Mesh and lace
I'll stop the world
and melt with you
You've seen the difference
And it's getting better
all the time
There's nothing
you and I won't do
I'll stop the world
and melt with you
You should know better
Dream of better lives
The kind which never hate
Dropped in the state of
Imaginary grace
I made a pilgrimage
To save this humans race
Never comprehending the race
Has long gone by
I'll stop the world
and melt with you
I've seen some changes
But it's getting better
all the time
There's nothing
you and I won't do
I'll stop the world
and melt with you
The future's
Open wide
Oh, oh
I'll stop the world
and melt with you
I'll stop the world
and melt with you.
SANTANA: I've got it.
I have got the perfect plan
for how to get this thing
off the ground.
Later today,
you are going to take
a couple of dogs
for a walk around the block,
where paparazzi will be
conveniently waiting.
You're gonna get snapped,
give a quote,
bam, Broadway Bitches
is off and running.
And I also snagged you
this designer number
by a designer that is so fancy,
I can't even pronounce his name.
There's hardly any vowels in it.
And if you wear it and
get photographed in it,
you get to keep it for free. But how
do we know that they'll be there?
I made a couple of calls
and I tweeted from your account,
and I used hashtag living,
so everyone sees it.
Oh, perfect.
RACHEL: Oh, my God, Kurt!
I have the best news
that I've been wanting
to tell you about.
Is Liza off her meds, running
around Central Park again?
I'm starting
a dog-rescue charity!
And Santana and Mercedes and I
are doing a performance.
It's gonna be great.
Oh, could I perform, too?
I-I've been itching to do
something outside of school.
One Three Hill's
been on a hiatus
ever since Elliot went
to his yoga retreat
and Dani's Roller Derby team
became state champions.
I-I... I think we're
just gonna keep it us girls.
We don't want the event
to be, like...
Amateur open mic night?
No, no, no, Kurt.
This is not personal, okay?
This is about Rachel
and her image.
And you are so good
that you would just be
pulling focus from her.
No, I-I get it.
I get that I haven't exactly
made a name for myself like
the rest of you have, but...
gosh, you'd just think
after everything,
someone would
throw a bone for once.
Kurt, wait.
MAGGIE :
All right, boys, I don't want...
MAGGIE:
I'll leave the window unlocked.
That strange boy may come
looking for his shadow.
Oh, Pillsbury, you made it!
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.
Sit down.
Take in the magic!
MAN: Debbie, it's your...
it's your cue.
Debbie! Rule number one:
hearing aids on
during rehearsal!
Uh-oh.
Peter's dead, folks.
MAGGIE: Of all times
she chooses to die,
less than a week away
from opening night.
Oh, she was always so selfish.
MARTY:
We have to cancel.
Debbie was the only one
with hips strong enough
f-for the harness.
Take a walk down
the halls here.
Room after room of beds
filled with people who won't
get out of them anymore.
Not because they can't
but because they can't find
any reason to.
This show,
uh, getting up in front
of an audience...
this was my reason.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
Wh-Wh... uh, when is
opening night?
Uh, Monday
at 4:00 p.m.
Incidentally,
that's also closing night.
I-I could fill in,
unless there's a rule
about residents only
being in the show.
First of all,
we only have two rules.
One, remember your teeth.
And your teeth.
And... don't mix up
your night pills
with your day pills.
It's simple.
I thought I was a pterodactyl.
Are you sure, Pillsbury?
Peter Pan is a very vocally
demanding role for a woman.
Can you handle it?
Oh, yeah.
I-I'm a countertenor,
and I practically have the score
memorized.
I was obsessed with my tape
of Mary Martin's version
when I was a kid.
She was my childhood hero.
Which explains a lot
now that I think about it.
We have a piano.
Uh, could you audition
with any music or anything?
You know, we just
can't hand you a part.
We have standards. Right?
I-I do. I always carry
sheet music with me
just in case.
Oh. Oh.
Oh.
Midnight
Not a sound
from the pavement
Has the moon
lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect
at my feet
And the wind
Begins to moan
Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be
a memory, too
And a new day
Will begin
Burnt-out ends
Of smoky days
The stale cold
smell of morning
A streetlamp dies
Another night is over
Another day is dawning
Touch me
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun
IE  Days in the sun
KURT:
If you touch me
BOTH:  You'll understand
what happiness is
Look, a new day
Has begun...
Has begun...
That's our Peter!
Yay!
SAM: Aw... ARTIE: This is
an unusually violent game.
Hey, McConaughey. Hey.
:
All right, all right, all right.
Grr.
We're working
on his impressions.
It's like watching
Goofy teach tricks to Pluto.
Mercedes is gonna
freak when she gets home.
Hush. She's gonna fall
in love with him,
just like I did. You have to
help me sell it to her so she,
like, thinks he's really awesome
when she gets here, okay?
ARTIE:
Don't worry. I got your back.
Sam? Did you
go back
and adopt that dog?
Uh... uh, hey.
I tried to stop him.
Uh, baby, yeah.
Sorry I didn't, uh, talk
to you about it first.
It's just that when I saw
McConaughey in his cage,
something inside me just clicked
and I knew that we were meant
for each other.
I blame Sarah McLachlan.
I don't mean to be patronizing,
but we have a kitchen full
of dead Chia Pets
that you can't take care of.
This is a living,
breathing creature.
So is Artie,
and I take care of him.
Hold up. Did you just...
Look, hey, look, I know
I can take care of him, okay?
I just...
Give me a chance.
Look, look, look.
:
Oh, McConaughey loves you.
He lo... :
Oh, oh, look at the face.
- The pooch. He d... The face.
- Okay. Fine.
If it's that important to you,
we will try it.
Okay. She's gone. Let's go.
- Did you pay the gas bill?
- Yeah.
Uh, no.
Uh, I've...
Artie was just
into this video game.
Did you take out the recycling?
Um, Artie was gonna do it
on his way out.
Am I still here? Am I invisible?
Hold up.
Is that my faux-huahua?
Uh...
Oh, I did that.
Okay, you better
clean this mess up.
Okay, just because
McConaughey is cute,
it doesn't mean...
Oh, no.
Oh, I know
that that dog
is not eating my hair.
I
that you did not let that dog
near my bedroom or my wardrobe
or my makeup!
I got to go. Um...
Sam!
Can one of you guys
bring me Don't.
Down the stairs? Don't you even speak.
Don't you even look
I got you. like you're
about to speak to me.
You just pack up that dog
and you take him back
where you got him
or, so help me,
I will go full-on Carcosa
on you.
RACHEL:
Easy.
Okay.
Oh, my God, is
that Rachel Berry,
star of Broadway's
smash-hit musical
ARTIE: I love her!
I saw
five times!
She is just so likeable!
RACHEL:
Oh!
Ms. Berry,
what on earth are you doing
walking all these
beautiful dogs?
Well, someone has to.
Did you know
that New York City shelters
are the most overpopulated
in the state?
What? No, I didn't know that.
That's such a shame.
That's why I'm starting
my own dog rescue charity,
Broadway Bitches.
Okay. Wait,
just stay right there.
At the, uh, Spotlight Diner.
Okay.
Oh, my God. Stay.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Ah!
Oh, my God.
At least you're wearing underwear.
I got dragged four blocks
and now I have to
pay for this dress
and that man got
bit by a shih tzu.
Seriously, is this a good idea?
Because I feel like
I look worse now.
No. Yes, this is
a good idea, okay?
Um, everybody's talking
about your activism.
And, in fact, out of the 500
Broadway Bitches Evites
that I sent out this morning,
over half are confirmed.
And I even have a reporter
from NYTheatreNews.com ready
to do a piece on it.
So just stick to the plan
and don't go soft on me.
Guys, I got good news.
I landed a role.
RACHEL:
"The Lexington Home
for Retired Performers
presents
And I'm Peter!
They needed an
emergency replacement
because the woman
playing him dropped... out.
Possibly be serious.
I am, actually,
and I'm very excited about it.
Opening night is Monday,
and I'd love to have you.
No, sorry, can't make it.
As much as I would love
to watch Homocchio
and the Geriatric Puppets
put on a depressing
sub-community theatre show,
Rachel's event is that night.
Well, that shouldn't be
a problem
because the show starts at 4:00.
I'm sorry, Kurt. Santana has
me doing all these photo ops
and interviews, and my
reputation is at stake here.
Seriously, you know,
I could lose jobs
if I don't clean this up.
I bend over backwards for you
every time you need something.
Well, I need you now
so please support me in this.
I am doing something good
for the animals.
No, you're doing it
for yourself.
You treat me exactly like
the world treats those dogs...
you just cast me aside.
Well, I'm done being a friend
only when it's convenient
for you.
SAM: Mercedes doesn't want me
to get rid of the dog, okay?
She just wants him
to stop tearing everything up.
ARTIE: You seriously think
you can train that dog?
I had to teach you
how to use Velcro.
Okay, yeah, well, Velcro's hard.
It's like black magic.
But, look, I can do this, okay?
Doggies crave discipline.
We'll just run him through
the Doggy Gauntlet of Doom...
it's a working title,
don't judge me...
and then once Mercedes gets home
tonight, he'll be groomed,
trained and ready
to melt her heart
with those big, beautiful puppy
dog eyes that he gets from me.
- Let's do it.
- All right, good.
I saw a werewolf with
a Chinese menu in his hand
Walking through the streets
of Soho
In the rain
He was looking for a place
called Lee Ho Fook's
Going to get a big dish
of beef chow mein
Ah-ooh
Werewolves of London
Ah-ooh...
Ah-ooh
Werewolves of London
Ah-ooh
If you hear him howling
around your kitchen door
You better not let him in
No, no, no
Little old lady
got mutilated late last night
Werewolves of London again
Ah-ooh, werewolves of London
Ah-ooh, ooh
Ah-ooh
Werewolves of London
Ah-ooh, ooh
Well, I saw Lon Chaney
walking with the Queen
Doing the werewolves
of London
I saw Lon Chaney Jr.
Walking with the Queen
Doing the werewolves
of London
All right
I saw a werewolf
Drinking a piña colada
at Trader Vic's.
Huh, his hair was perfect.
Yeah
Ah-ooh
Ooh, ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, uh, uh
Werewolves of London
Draw blood
Ah, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
Werewolves of London.
Boys, I've returned
to Neverland!
GUS: Maggie, you're supposed
to be on the ground.
Peter, we killed a giant bird
while you were gone.
If I get down,
I'm not getting back up.
Oh, we look ridiculous!
What were we thinking when
we chose to do
Well, we wanted
to show our families
that we were still
energetic and young.
Right, Freddie?
But you guys still
energetic and young.
You know, if you want to seem
young, you got to feel young.
I don't know about all of that.
I was thinking
of changing up the music.
You know, maybe updating it
a little bit.
I still think that we should do
Ever since you were a question
on
you have been
such a know-it-all.
Maggie, flowers came for you.
Oh.
Oh, they're from
my daughter, Clara!
She's a defense
attorney. "Mom,
"sorry I have
to miss opening night.
I have to be in Reno
for a deposition."
Oh.
She is so thoughtful.
She spoils me.
Oh, that's too bad.
I know how important
Clara is to her.
She talks about her constantly.
All about their lunches, and
their late night phone calls,
and their double dates.
Except none of it's real.
Those flowers aren't
from her daughter.
Maggie sends herself flowers
once a week
to keep up appearances.
Clara hasn't been here in years.
You are shredding my last nerve.
Before you say anything else,
you should know
that Artie and I tamed the beast
that is McConaughey.
He's not barking,
he's been off his leash
for the last few hours,
but didn't poop anywhere
he wasn't supposed to,
and he didn't eat any
of your weird, strange,
Indian hair.
All of that is great,
Sam, but we talked about this,
and we both agreed,
we can't take care of a dog.
Really? Because
it looks like
I'm doing a pretty good
job of it right now.
For the moment.
But what's gonna happen when
you have, like, a 20-hour shoot,
and you can't walk McConaughey,
or-or put out his food?
I don't know. I thought
maybe you could help.
Well, I would, and I could, but
what happens when I go on tour?
Uh, we could get a dog-sitter.
I don't know.
Who's gonna call the sitter?
Who's gonna make sure
that they have a key to get in?
Who's gonna pay them?
I am, and you know what else
I've been thinking about?
You going on tour, and me
being in this brownstone,
all alone
and wanting some company.
You know, last time I checked,
New York's a pretty lonely town.
Is that what
this is really about?
Maybe.
Partly, yes.
But if we're being honest,
I think it's also about
when I suggested
we take McConaughey home,
you couldn't even imagine me
being able to take care of him,
okay, and that's just...
that's just crap, okay.
It's like you're looking at me
like I'm a boy and not a man.
- Sam...
- Look, I took care of
my whole family
when they had nothing, okay.
When they were as poor
and as homeless as McConaughey.
I made sure they ate,
I made sure
they had a roof over their head,
I made sure my little brother
and sister got
to school on time.
Me, Sam, the slacker.
- Oh, Sam, I... I know.
- But, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know... I know
that I forget about
appointments sometimes,
and I leave my clothes
around the apartment,
and I get distracted
playing video games,
but that doesn't mean
I'm a joke.
I never called you a joke.
Mercedes, look, I...
I want to marry you eventually,
when we're ready, and I
want to have a family
with a house and a yard
and kids and stuff,
but that's only gonna happen
if you start taking me
seriously, and that starts with
me proving to you that I can
take care of McConaughey.
You-you did, and, uh, I'm giving
you your props for that.
Okay, great.
But I...
I still don't think
that you should keep him.
Why not?
Because it's not good for him,
Sam. Like I said, I'm about
to go on tour, and you...
your schedule's crazy,
and it's just gonna get worse.
So, what's the point
of having a dog, even one
as cute as McConaughey,
if you can't
take care of him,
and you can't enjoy him?
You heard
what they do to the pets
that you bring back
to the shelters, right?
Well, then, you're gonna have
to find a home for him.
And I promise you, some day,
we're gonna have
everything that you want.
Okay, and that includes a dog.
But we're still figuring
things out between you and me,
like who we are together
and where we're gonna be.
I just don't think
that we should drag McConaughey
into that, do you?
WOMAN:
Liz, send in my 10:00.
Hi. Um, I'm Kurt Hummel.
Um, I-I didn't
actually cause
a major chemical spill
in National Park.
Uh, your receptionist said
that you were really busy,
and that was the only way that I
could make an appointment, so...
Oh. Uh...
Liz, call security.
Well...
They should only need one guy.
No. It's-it's about your mother.
I'm-I'm friends with her.
Wait. Is this some kind of
Martha Raye-Mark Harris thing?
'Cause she doesn't
have any money.
No, no. We're performing
together at the home.
Uh,
Uh, she's Wendy, I'm Peter.
Okay. Weird, but whatever.
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but the minute the show's over,
she's gonna lose your number.
I...
I don't know what happened
between you two, but, uh,
I can't imagine a sweet old lady
like that hurting anyone.
Well...
she wasn't always
a sweet old lady.
She was young and ambitious and
so hungry to get back
in the game,
she tended
to forget little things,
like her daughter at school
and birthdays.
And I bet
that was very painful,
but your mother is 86 years old.
I mean, don't you want
to forgive before it's too late?
Oh, I've forgiven.
Wasn't her fault.
She never should have become
a mother in the first place.
Did you know that she sends
herself flowers from you,
and that she talks about you
constantly?
I know all about the scar
on your elbow from the time
that you climbed on the counter
trying to get the box
of Frosted Flakes, nd your
fear of balloons, and that
you aced the SAT.
Wow.
Did she also tell you
that she missed
my high school graduation?
She had a dream,
and she got lost in it.
But she is clearly
full of regret.
My mom died when I was eight,
and I spent my entire life
pretending that I had one.
Whatever she did to you,
yours is still here.
Don't you see that by coming
to see her perform
for taking her away from you
that you could heal all of this?
Well, your mother
couldn't take care of you
when you were little, but
you could take care of her now.
RACHEL: Oh, this is better than
I could have ever imagined!
I mean, a dozen dogs
have already been adopted,
and we just started! Hi.
Okay, um, Beverly Stevens
from NYTheatreNews.com
is going to be
here later today,
and I've picked out
the perfect pooch
for you to pose with.
He's a three-legged dog!
Oh. Come here.
Who doesn't love a lady
holding a three-legged dog?
You know, it's like
a ticket to Heaven.
Oh, Santana,
you're really good at this.
Have you ever thought about
doing this professionally?
Sure enough,
every time I watch
Okay, come on, Sam.
We have to turn McConaughey
into the doggie rescue.
No way, Jose.
Guys, I think we have an issue.
RACHEL: I'm going to
have to take the dog.
You're telling me
I can't take this dog?
Just, I need to take the dog.
No, I can't believe that!
No, no, no, no, no.
WOMAN: No. RACHEL: Yeah,
'cause I have to take
a photo with that dog
later, so...
But this is the dog
my son wants to adopt.
Isn't that the whole point
of this event?
Um, well, maybe you could just
wait a couple of hours?
I have to catch a train back
to Long Island in 20 minutes.
Okay, I'm so sorry, lady,
but hand over the tripod,
and nobody'll get hurt.
I'm sorry...
I can't...
I get it.
I know who you are.
I read the Broadway blogs.
You can't redeem a lie
with more lies.
You may get away
with this farce this time,
but you're a fraud, and
it's gonna come out soon enough.
You don't care
about these dogs.
I doubt you care much
about anyone but yourself.
Come on, honey, let's go home.
Don't listen to her.
Look at...
Look at her shoes.
Thanks. I just don't want
the harness to show.
I mean,
the show's tacky enough.
Well, I am missing
dinner with June
and Diane von Furstenberg
at Annie Leibovitz's house,
but... there's no
other place I'd rather be.
Drop all the names you want,
my old ladies are much
cooler than yours.
It's really nice
to see you so happy.
I never thought
that a retirement home
can make someone smile so much.
You know, for the first time
since I moved here, I...
I feel like I'm doing
something with purpose.
Besides school, of course.
Should I save some seats?
No, no, I'll see you after.
Okay.
Love you.
Me, too.
Oh, uh, don't sit
in the first row.
I don't trust the harness.
And Gladys has been having
a hard time keeping
solid foods down, so...
Okay.
Break a leg.
:
Thanks.
You know, Maggie,
I was thinking,
since your daughter and my
friends are always so busy,
why don't we become
each other's family?
I mean, you'd be
doing me a favor.
I-I could use
someone to talk to.
: Well, as long as
I'd be doing you a favor,
I'd love to.
RACHEL: Hello? Hey, it's me.
Um, my show is about to start,
and I just wanted
to wish you good luck
at the benefit.
I know things have been really
tense between us this week,
um, but I would
never want you to think
that I'm not proud
or supportive of you.
Um, I'm-I'm very glad
you're doing what you're doing,
because... my life
would certainly be dull
without friends like you
to inspire me every day.
That is very sweet of you,
but I have to go,
because, um, my best friend's
show is about to start.
KURT:
Oh.
You must be my lucky star
'Cause you shine on me
Wherever you are
I just think of you
And I start to glow
And I need your light
And, baby, you know
Starlight, star bright
First star I see tonight
Starlight
Make everything all right
Starlight
Star bright,
first star I see tonight
Starlight
Hey, yeah
You must be
My lucky star
'Cause you make the darkness
Seem so far
And when I'm lost
You'll be my guide
I just turn around,
and you're by my side
Starlight, star bright
First star I see tonight
Starlight, star bright
Make everything all right
Starlight
Star bright
First star I see tonight
Starlight
Star bright
Hey, yeah
Shine your heavenly body
Tonight
'Cause I know you're gonna
Make everything all right
You may be
My lucky star
What you do to me, baby
Baby
You know
You know
I'm the luckiest by far
Starlight
Star bright
Baby
Starlight
Star bright
What you do to me, baby
You know
You know
I'm the luckiest by far
Starlight
Star bright.
Clara.
Seeing you in the audience
makes this
the best performance of my life.
A friend of yours told me
it was one I couldn't miss.
I'm so glad he did.
I have so many things to say.
So many "I'm sorrys."
And I so want to know
about your life.
Oh, my gosh you were amazing!
I couldn't stop smiling
watching you perform
with all these sweet old folks.
It's like, this is gonna be us
in the future when we're older,
and be so cute.
It is,
and we'll be very cute.
Oh, dude, hold up.
Well, hello. This harness cannot
be good for the sack puppies.
Oh, years of skinny jeans
have prepared me
for this performance.
Well, you look great.
The costume and the key.
Yeah, I just wish
more people could see
Maggie and the gang perform.
I mean, they're the real stars.
Hey, there's a bus outside.
There's a... Freddie, wake up!
Wake up!
Freddie, there's a bus outside,
and it's got a lift.
Oh, a lift?
A lift.
Yeah, okay.
Oh, boy.
Why is there a bus outside?
Artie was able to get
the film school
to loan it to us for the day.
This is your opening night gift.
:
Hey, everybody!
I'm Sam,
and there's a bus outside.
Old people usually freak me out,
but in this case,
you guys are pretty cool.
Anyway, Rachel has asked us
on behalf
of the adoption charity
Broadway Bitches,
to personally invite all of you
to be our guest performers
at an event we're holding
this evening.
Well, what do you say, Maggie?
Do you think you have
a second act in you?
I never used to believe
in second acts,
but you've proven me wrong.
KURT :
Great.
To the bus, everybody!
Hello, everyone.
Thank you so much for coming
and supporting Broadway Bitches.
You know, as New Yorkers,
we get so wrapped
up in our careers
and making it that we forget
the importance
of really creating a legacy
that we can be proud of.
Um, and what better way
and what's more rewarding
than giving back
to man's best friend
and to all of our friends,
really.
So please join me
in giving a warm welcome
to some very special friends who
are here today to help us out.
From the Lexington Home
of Retired Performers,
give it up and enjoy the song.
If he's not going home with us,
we need to find the perfect
home for McConaughey.
If you don't, Sam, I mean,
we'll just,
we'll figure something out,
but we're not gonna take him
back to the shelter.
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go
Till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey,
just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I get frightened
In all this darkness
I get nightmares
I hate to sleep alone
I need some company
A guardian angel
To keep me warm
when the cold winds blow
I can feel you breathe
I can feel
your heart beat faster
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go
Till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey,
just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Be my little baby
Yeah
Just like Ronnie sang
I said,
just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Baby, my darling
Oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa
I feel the hunger
I feel the hunger
Don't go
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go
till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey,
just like Ronnie sang
Be my little baby
Take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go
Till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen, honey, take me
Take me home
Tonight.
This was inspired,
to say the least.
New Broadway mixing with old,
plus this amazing cause.
Where did you get
the inspiration
to put on an event like this?
Well, it's funny that you ask,
because, um, I actually have
an amazing publicist.
Well, thank you.
Hi, uh, Santana Lopez,
public relations.
My motto is "If I can make
Berry work, I can do anything."
And it was actually
my really amazing friend, Kurt,
all these incredible retired
Broadway performers.
Oh, well, we are uploading
the video
that my cameraman shot
on our site immediately,
and I am betting that we are
going to get a lot of hits.
Thank you for all your support,
but Rachel isn't giving herself
enough credit.
I mean, this is
a true collaboration,
- and we're just happy to
be giving back. - Yay!
