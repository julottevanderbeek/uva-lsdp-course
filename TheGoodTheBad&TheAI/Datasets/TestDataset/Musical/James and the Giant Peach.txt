This is James Henry Trotter.
He lived with his mother and father in
a cozy little house by the sea.
- Hey, I 've got ya!
-
Happy birthday, darling. Now, quickly,
blow them out before the wind does.
Make a wish first.
It was a wonderful life.
Theyhad each other,
and theyhad their dreams.
Look!
That cloud
looks like a camel.
And that one over there
looks like a train engine.
Can you see the tallest building
in the world?.
I can't find it.
Try looking at it
anotherway.
Isee it!
That's wherewe're going--
on the great ship thatwill take us
across the ocean,
and we'll go right to the top
ofthat building.
The three ofus...
on top oftheworld.
Are there any kids
there like me?.
Hundreds ofthem.
It's a wonderful place,James.
A citywhere
dreams come true.
Then one day,
a terrible thing happened.
An angry rhinoceros
appeared out ofnowhere...
and gobbled up
his poor mother and father.
Their troubles--
ifthey had any at all--
were over in 35 seconds flat.
- ButJames's troubles
werejust beginning,
-
for now he lives here
with Aunt Sponge...
Get up,
you lazy little bug!
- andAunt Spiker.
- You've already wasted
four minutes of daylight.
Look at him,
lollygagging in dreamland,
when there's
so much work to do.
Weeds to pull, wood to chop.
Work, work, work, work, work!
Eww. Wouldn't want one of those
nesting in your knickers.
I look and smell--
I do declare--
as lovely as a rose.
Just feastyour eyes
upon my face.
Observe my shapely nose.
Beholdmyheavenly,
silkylocks.
And If I take off
both my socks,
you'll see my dainty toes.
But don't forget,
my dearest Sponge,
how much
your tummy shows!
-
-
You lazybug!
Who toldyou to stop working?
I finished the wood.
A travel book?.
How dare you even dream ofleaving?.
This is the only home
you'll ever have.
No one else would tolerate
a worthless little nothing likeyou.
Where did you get this?.
Where?.
Father gave it to me.
He said we're to go there one day.
Stupid,
foolish man!
Foolish man, always
dreaming. That's what got him killed.
- And your mother.
- Had his head in the clouds...
instead of looking
where he was going.
He never even saw that rhino coming.
That rhino!
And the beast will getyou too
ifyou don't behave.
Now get these stupid dreams
out ofyour head...
and get back towork!
-~~
- Careful, Spongy. Wouldn'twant
to ruin that girlish figure.
Oh, shut up!
- Yes?.
- I finished all ofthe chores.
What a coincidence!
We finished all the dinner.
Oh, Sponge,
you're such a tease.
There's something special
waiting foryou in the oven.
-
-
Oh, do let me guess:
They're not good enough for him.
What doyou think this is,
Buckingham Palace?.
- Yuck!
-
- Get out ofoursight!
- Go on!
Go on!
Hello, there.
Where did you come from?.
You know, you probably shouldn't build
yourweb up here in the window.
Spiker and Sponge might seeyou,
and they hate spiders.
I'll beyourfriend, though.
~ My name is James ~
~That's what Mother called me ~

Good night.
Pleasant dreams.
Aah! Spider! Vermin!
Oh, beast!
No, wait!
- Sponge!
- Wait, I'll get it! I'll get it.
Kill it! Kill it!
Kill it!
- Where is it?. Whoo!
- Aah!
- Get it! Get it! Aah!
-  Kill it.
-Aah! Get it, get it!
- Kill it!
Get it! Aah!
You hit me in the face.
You hit me in the face!
Oh, doshut up!
Go on, get out ofhere. Get as far away
from this place as you possibly can.
Oh, I wish I could.
- What's stoppingyou?
-
Oh, don't be frightened,James.
I meanyou no harm.
- How'd you know my name?.
-
I know more
than just your name.
What wouldyou say
ifl were to tellyou...
that the answer to all
your troubles is right here...
- inside this little bag?.
- Hey, that's my--
Ofcourse it is!
Go on,James.
Have a look.
There's more magic in them things
than in all the rest
ofthe world put together.
But... what are they?.
- Crocodile tongues.
- Tongues?.
One thousand long,
slimy crocodile tongues,
boiledin the skull ofa dead witch
for 20 days and 20 nights.
Add the fingers of a young monkey,
the gizzard of a pig,
the beak of a parrot
and three spoonfuls of sugar.
Stew for a week,
and then let the moon...
-
- do the rest.
Have 'em,
and marvelous things will happen;
things even you never dreamt of.
- Like what?.
- Well, like...
you'll neverbe
miserable again.
Andyou are miserable,
aren'tyou,James?
You weren't meant to be,
you know?
And that place
you're dreaming of--
I t's not as far away
as you think.
New York City!
And it'll be that much closer
once you take the first step.
But how?.
This doesn't make any sense.
Not up here it doesn't.
The answers are in here,
and the magic is in here.
So,James,
what'll it be?.
Now listen to me,James. Don't let
them get away, because ifthey do...
they'll work theirmagic on whoever
or whatever theymeet first.
Understand?
-
- Good.
What's going on out here?
- Uuh! Oh! No, wait!
-
Wait! No! No, wait!
Wait, just a--
- Wait.
-  Here he is.
Get up, you little worm!
We sentyou out here to kill a spider!
- Not to laze about.
- I wasn't lazing about. I tripped.
- How dareyou disagree with us!
- Beat him, Sponge.
It's too early.
Well, that makes you
the luckiest boy alive.
Now come inside
and get dressed!
Spiker, look! A peach!
- Awhat?.
- A peach!There, on that branch.
Why, that old tree's never hadso much
as a blossom on it, let alone a--
Well, I'll be blowed.
There really is a peach there.
A nice, big one too.
How can we get it?.
- The boy! Now,
you be a good little boy...
- The boy!
and climb up there and get that peach
foryour dear aunties.
- Can we eat it?.
- Of course we can. We'll share it.
Me and your Aunt Spiker!
Now start climbing.
- Wait!
-  What?
- What, what?
- It's-- It's growing.
- The boy?.
- No, the peach, you idiot!
Look.
Oh! Come down!
- But I won't get hurt.
- Climb down!
What a peach.
What a peach!
Look, Spiker,
it's still growing!
I'm not blind, you dolt.
I can see for myself.
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
Look at it go!
It's a miracle.
It's coming down!
Stand back!
Oh, myheavens! My--
Marvelous things will happen,
just like he said.
Shut up,
you little grub.
This has nothing to dowith you,
sojust keep awayfrom it.
Oh!
Canyousmell that, Spikey?
- It smells delicious.
- No!
It smells like... money.
Roll up, roll up. See the giant peach.
The Eighth Wonder ofWorld.
Have your money ready, ladies
and gentlemen. Chance of a lifetime.
Ten bob only!
No peeking at the peach! Haveyour
money ready, ladies and gentlemen.
Inyougo.
- Can we touch it?.
- Touch it?. You want to touch it?.
Huh! She'll be wanting
to taste it next.
Admission refused. This child
has too many cheeky ideas. Go away!
-  Quite right!
- Ooh, Sponge.
-
- A photographer.
-
- And another.
- Best side.
-
- Move on in.
- No cameras allowed.
Don't dawdle!
Come along, ladies andgentlemen.
Sorry, Father, it'll costyou double.
- May God forgive you.
- Thankyou, Father.
Come along, children.
Last chance ofthe day.
Yoo-hoo! Come down here.
Yes, Auntie Sponge?.
Oo-ooh,
you're all spiffed up.
I was hoping to play
with the children.
- Aww!
- Aww! The children have gone.
Butyou can play
with their garbage.
Heh, heh, heh!
Garbage! Heh, heh, heh!
And don't even think
ofgoing near ourpeach.
'Cause ifyou do-- You know,
they never did catch that rhino.
-
-
No! Wait a moment!
Wait!
Ahh.
Mmm. Mmm.
'Ere, now.
Where doyou thinkyou're goin', Yank?
I'm goin'stir-crazy.
I gotta take a look around.
- Plan our escape
from Spiker and Sponge.
-  Escape?
To where? We'll all be squashed...
swatted... smooshed!
No one's goi ng to " smoosh" you,
my dear boy.
- You're six feet long now.
- Bigger target.
Let the biddies come.
I'll take 'em both on.
I'm "indefeatable."
I'm indivisible. I'm...
- Whoa!
- in trouble!
-
- It's Spiker and Sponge!
They've foundus!
- Hel-lo!
- Oof! Uuh!
No, no, no. It's the lad
from the house. What's his name?.
- Miserable Tick.
- I thought it was Rotten Little Grub.
- No, that's what those
horrible aunts call him.
-
His real name is--
Well, it's, eh, eh--
- It's James.
- Aaah!
Lookwhatyou've done now, miss.
Scared him to death.
Please! Don't eat me!
- Eat you?.
-
Hey, Glowworm,
turn upyour lights.
-
- Ahh!
- I'm a vegetarian.
- I eat dirt.
No onewill be eating you,
James.
Yeah, she'll just punctureyour head
and suck out the brains.
- That I am saving foryou.
- Whoa! Prettyfast, long legs.
-
- Oh-oo-oo!
Oh, such rude behavior. There's
no need to be frightened, dearie.
Butyou're enormous bugs!
- Fascinating, isn't it?.
- We've all changed...
- and so haveyou,James.
-
The old man-- the one
who gave me the green things--
He said marvelous things
will happen.
Did he say,
" Marvelous pigs in satin"?.
No, dear lady.
" Marvelous things will happen."
Poor Glowworm.
She's a little deaf.
I, however,
have exquisite hearing.
- Yeah?. Well, listen to this.
-
- Let's get outta here!
- Waa-aa!
You mean leave the hill?.
I can't. The rhino will get me.
Rhino?.
I say, dear boy, I've lived
on this miserable hill for decades.
- There are no rhinoceri here.
- Except for Sponge.
- She's twice as big as a rhino,
eh, kid?.
-
And twice as dangerous.
My life hangs by a thread every day.
I've had to send all 300
of me children to safer pastures.
Hah! You think hiding
in solid rock is fun?.
I can't even remember
what fun is.
Well, it's just 'causeyou've been stuck
here too long. Listen to me, kid.
I know a place
that'll refresh your memory.

Hup! Time to go make a pest
of myself. Heh-heh!
Look at this place.
It's still filthy.
Where areyou,you detestable worm?
- Aah!
- Not you! Me!
You better not
be near our peach!
Oh, please!
Don't let them spray us!
Spray us?. They'll see the Yank up there
and come after us with a shovel.
- It happened to my brother.
- How awful.
Split him right down the middle.
Now I have two half-brothers.
Shh! They'll hear us.
Yoo-hoo! Where areyou, boy?
I think I hear
a rhino out here!
Ahh! This'll be a snap.
Shh! I really do
hear something.
Timber.
- What's that?.
- Fasten your seat belts, kids!
- Aaah! The car!
- Aaah! The car!
- We're turning!
- Wha-Wha-Wha-- What haveyou done?.
- Start, start, you piece ofjunk!

- Our peach!
Where are we?
Ow! Somebody pinched me!
Sorry. I thought
you were the Spider.
-
- Ouch! What was that?.
Excuse. I thought you
were the Centipede.
Hey, Glowworm,
how about some light?.
I can't hearyou, dear.
I'll have to put my light on.
- Oh! Oh!
This is so un-ladybug-like!
-
- Don'tworry. I'll haveyou
right-side up in no time.
- Oh!
Thankyou,James.
Where areyou going?.
To see where we've landed.
Whoa!
Oh, my!
Oh, my, my!
Oh, my achin' back!
Ohh!
Fascinating, isn't it?.
What?. What's fascinating, tell me?.
Don't leave me dangling.
We're in the middle ofthe--
How doyou say?. The big puddle.
- The biggest puddle ofthem all,
angel fangs:
-
- the Atlantic Ocean.
- Technically, the Pacific is larger.
Well... that goes
without saying.
- But there is land in sight?.
- Nothing but blue skies
and clearwaters.
Uuuh!
This is all yourfault!
Hey! Wasn't for me, we'd all
be Spiked and Sponged by now!
This old man with his green things--
did he happen to speak
towherewe are going?.
No. All he said was
the answers would be right here.
Huh?. Mytravel book!
And look!
It's the peach!
We'regoing to
New York City!
-  NewYork?.
They love me there!
- Wonderful! They've got...
- a whole park full ofleaves
foryou, Miss Ladybug.
- Oh!
- Central Park!
- And loads of dark hiding places.
- Nightclubs!
- And museums and concerts.
- Not to mention Yankee Stadium.
- What about me?.
- Why, they've got miles and miles
ofunderground tunnels!
- The subway!
Myfather says it's the place
where dreams come true.
- ~That's the life for me ~
- ~That's the life for me ~

- ~That's the life for me ~
- ~That's the life ~

~That's the life
That's the life ~
~ For me ~~
NewYork it is then.
Now, how dowe get there?.
- I'll get us there.
- You?.
Sure! I've sailed
all the five seas:
from the sun-drenched wreaths
of Bora Bora...
to the icy shores
ofTripoli.
- Oh!
- Commodore Centipede,
-
- they used to call me.
- Seven.
- Huh?.
There are seven seas.
And Tripoli is in
the subtropics... Commodore.
- Trim the sails!
- There are no sails.
- Stoke the engines!
- There are no engines.
I can't work
with this miserable crew.
Great! We're stuck here
until we shrivel up and die.
- Highly improbable.
- That's a relief.
- We're far more likelyto drown.
-
-  Oh, no!
-
I know! We could--
No, it's a stupid idea.
- Compared towhat?.
- Hey!
Well, we could fly out.
- Mm-mm.
- He's right. It's stupid.
-
- How would you do it,James?.
With the sea gulls.
But we'll need string.
Oh, well, I'll just go to
the stationer's and pick up
some paper clips while I'm at it!
I have string.
Miles ofstring.
Andwe'llneedbait;
birdbait.
Bird bait?. Where doyou expect
we're gonna find bird bait
out here in the middle ofthe--
-
-The-- Oh, no.
No, no!
Haveyou lostyour minds?. Aah!
They've lost their minds!
Anything but birds!
Don'tworry, I'm right here.
- Nowwiggle.
- No!
- But theywon't come
ifyou don'twiggle.
- Exactly, and you can't make me.
- Oh, yeah?.
- Stop! Ah-ha-ha!
Oh! Hey, no fair!
Mockingbirds munched me mother!
Here comes the first one.
Get readyto pull down there.
Mysisters wereswallowedbyswallows!
- Pull!
-  Whoo!
It worked! I got one!
Shh! I hear teeth.
Great, big, gnashing teeth!
-
- Sounds like a rhinoceros!
In the ocean?.
Uh, scientifically impossible.
I hear something too.
It's a school ofTuna.
They're being sucked into
some sort ofmachine.
- What doyou mean?.
- Take a look.
It's a giantshark!
- It seems to have spotted us!
-
What do we do?.
What do we do?.
The sea gulls!
It's our only chance.
It would take the whole flock and
then some. We'll never do it in time.
We'll use Miss Spider's web
for a net. Hurry!
Throw it here, dearie!
Wiggle, Mr. Earthworm!
Our lives depend on it!
- I can't! I'm all wiggled out!
- Aw!
- Here, let me helpyou.
-
-
- Come and get it!
Getyourfresh, hotwienie!
- Yaaah! Uugh!
- Come on, baby!
I got 'em!
Hand me the loops!
- Hurry!
- Shake a leg there!
Keepyour pants on!
I've only got 1 2 hands.
It's getting closer!
Sea gulls away!
-
- Oh, no!
- Oh, dear!
-
Huh-huh-ho!
Daah! Uuh!
- Yow!
- Oh!
- Arf, arf, arf!
- Arf!
- They're getting away!
Hop on,James!
Now nab them!
-
-
- Help!
- Help!
Hooligans! Ruffians!
Degenerates!
Uuh! Uhh!
- Come on, sea gulls!
- Putyour backs into it!
Shakeyour
bloomin' tail feathers!
Good sharky. Nice sharky.
-
- Oh! Sharky!
-
-
-
-
- Oof!
- Gaah!
- Aah!
- Oh! Uuh!
All right!
Teach ya to mess with me, ya overgrown
sardine! I'm from Brooklyn!
Oh, ho-ho! Pure twaddle!
Everybug on boarddisplayed
extraordinary courage.
Why, did you see Miss Ladybug
risk life and wing...
- to bash those brutes on the snoot?.
- Ooh!
Well, theywere being very rude.
I can't abide rudeness.
We are all
forgetting something.
Everything we did was part
ofthe brilliant plan ofJames.
It really did work,
didn't it?.
Isay,
three cheers forJames!
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray!
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray!
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray!
New York...
here... we... co-ome!
- Ooh-ooh!
- Whoeveryou are,
keep away from me! Keep away!
- Earthworm! It's me!
- Wha-Wha-Wha--
Oh,James.
Oh, thank goodness.
- You mustn't frighten yourself
like this all the time.
- Why not?.
You'll makeyourselfsick.
When I had a problem, my mum and dad
would tell me to lookat it anotherway.
How?. First I was bird bait,
then I was shark bait.
I suppose. Or, you could say
you gave us wings to fly,
and defeated a giant shark
single-handedly.
No-handedly.
Exactly.
You're a hero.
I am?.
I'm... WonderWorm!
You are!
Want... food.
Food.
Yousureyou know
where we're going?
I don't see howyou can navigate
without a compass.
-
-
Huh?.
It's very hot up here.
I'm roasted.
Huh?.
- Unhand that bird!
- Aah-aah!
But I'm dyin' ofhunger!
Oh, perhaps I have a bit
ofsoda bread in here somewhere.
- Food?.
- It's not much, but it's--
- Not so fast!
- Hey!
- You?.
I need this food. I have
a much higher metabolism.
- Bite me!
- What?.
- Haveyou two gone mad?.
Let go ofit, Gramps!
Give it! Give it to me!
- Let go of my coat!
- Give it to me!
- Ow! My lower thorax!
- I'll rip you apart!
- I tell you, it's mine!
- Give... it... back!
Now lookwhatyou've done!
We're going to starve.
Waste away. And not quickly.
Oh, no, that wouldbe
the easy way out. We'll linger.
-
- Slowly. Miserably. Painfully.
- Nobody's going to starve.
- Eh?.
Don't you see?. We have
enough food here for five voyages.
- Food?. Where?.
What are you talkin' about?.
- Is there really food?.
- Ourwhole ship is made offood!
- Oh, such a clever little boy.
- Takes after me.
- Afteryou there is
nothing left to take.
- It's delectable. Mmm-mmm!
- Betterthan aphids.
Mm, betterthan ladybugs.
- What?.
- Excuse.
It's not dirt...
but it's not bad.
Not bad?. It's the best thing
I've ever tasted,
and I have tasted
a lot.

You keep toyourself, don'tyou?

I would not know.
Theywould beyour friends too. The
others, I mean, ifyou'd just let them.
No, it is in their nature to have
fear ofme. This I cannot change.
You'revery kind to me.
Maybe this is because
you are kind to me first.
- You were the spider in mywindow.
- Mm-hmm.
You were my first friend.
I mean, since I went to live
with my aunts. They hated me!
Shh. Do not
think ofthem now.
Butwhat iftheyfind us?
What ifwe don't
make it to NewYork?
I'll die ifl have to go backto
theway I was! They can't make me.
Nobody can makeyou
do anything,James,
ifyou do not let them.
You are a brave boy.
Now to sleep.
You have had a very
"tired-making" day.
-
-
Look, the little maggot's
stuffing his facewith our peach!
- Get him, Sponge!
-
You can't crawl away
from us!
The rhino will getyou.
The rhino will getyou.
The rhino will getyou.
The rhino will getyou.
The rhino will getyou.
The rhino will getyou.
The rhino will getyou.
-
- Whoa.
-
-  This is an outrage!
You are a disgrace toyourphylum,
class, order, genus andspecies!
- Say it in English!
- You, sir, are an ass!
Where are we?
What's going on?
- I found this dime-store timmy
asleep at the helm.
-
- Now we're lost.
- We are not lost!
- Then where are we?
- Somewhere north,
or possiblyvery, very far south.
What's your latitude?
What's your longitude?
Hey, hey, hey!
That's personal, bub.
You said you could navigate!
- You said you traveled the world.
- You said you'd been to Bora Bora.
Well, not Bora Bora,
per se, uh--
What about the shores
ofTripoli?
Did I say "Tripoli"?
I meant the Halls of Montezuma.
- That's whatyou said.
- Never have I heard such mendacity!
- Charlatan!
- Wait!
Ifhe says he's seen the world,
then he's seen the world.
Right, Mr. Centipede?
- Right?
- Well...
I did used to live between two pages
ofa National Geographic.
Huh?
-
- Veryinformative magazine, National
Geographic. Wonderful pictures.
You incompetent,
blithering nitwit!
All right, hoppy!
Them's fightin' words.
Put 'em up!
Put 'em up! Come on!
Gimmeyour best shot.
Whoa. Good shot.
Did you seewhat he did to me?
Hmph!
Serves ya right.
What dowe do now?
Which way dowe go?
Oh, it's simple, really. All we need
to do is determine our coordinates,
then use triangulation to chart
a direct route to NewYork.
- Then there's hope.
- Don't be ridiculous.
There's no hope at all!
We don't have a compass.
We'll never reach New York.
We're gonna be stuck here forever. We're
gonna be frozen like living statues.
- Dead living statues.
-
No dark hidingplaces.
No cozyleafin the park.
-
-
No city where dreams come true.
Don't ships have compasses?
No doubt. But to brave
those icy waters...
would mean certain death.
-
- Onlya fool would do it.
Uh-huh.
Geronimo!
- What? What was that?
- The Centipede jumped in!
-
- Good heavens!
He's committed pesticide.
Oh, this is all
my doing.
Don't take all the credit.
I helped too.
- I have to go after him!
- Not on your life.
You'll catch your death of cold.
-But he's myfriend.
-James is right. Centipede is one ofus.
Get on my back.
I'm going with you.
- You had bettertake good care ofhim.
- This I promise.
Stay bythe line, and when
you feel two tugs, pull us up.
A skellington?
Hmm?
Jackpot!
A genuine compass!
-
- Sounds likeyou need
a little oil, Captain.
Thankyou, sir!
I'll be shovin' offnow.
-
-  I should'veworn a belt!
-
- Holy shipwreck!
-
-
-
- Listen, fellas,
I got a long history ofback problems,
and I don't need it to get any longer!
Aaah!
Aah!
-
- Aah! Hey, that one felt pretty good.
-
-
It's Paul Bunyan coming
to cut me some slack. Whoa!
Whoa! Hey, pal,
you're aimin'a little low.
He's gonna cut me in half!
Hey, sailors!
Looking for some kicks?
Oooh!
Cut me loose!
Get the com pass!
Ah!
- Have got it!
- " Ubutu!"
Whoa-oo!
-
-
- Gotcha!
-
- Polly want a smacker?
-
- Look out!
-
- Sounds like big trouble.
- Get ready to pull.
I got a good one forya.
- Why don't skeletons
play music in church?
- Oh!
-
- 'Cause theygot no organs!
-
- A-ha-ha!
Noo-oo!
Oh, thank goodness!
You're all right!
- What happened to Centipede?
- He found a compass for us.
- And a shipload of pirates!
- Hold this. I am going back.
Do be careful,
Miss Spider.
Ohh.
Poor Centipede.
He saved our lives
down there.
- Look out!
- Miss Spider!
-
- Centipede!
How am I lookin', kid?
Centipede, I do not know
whether to kill you or... kiss you.
-
-
- I'm so sorry.
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- My sincere apologies.
- I just wanna apologize.
- I just wanted to say--
- What I'm tryin' to say--
That's enough chitchat!
I'm freezin'!
Hello?
The compass is ready!
Mr. Centipede, would you please
do us the honor of navigating us
out ofthis icebox?
- Itwould be my pleasure.
- I believe our position
puts us very close--
I admireyour bravery, Miss Spider.
I really do.
Why... thankyou,
Mrs. Ladybug.
All right, boys.
Coffee break's over.
-
-
I'm looking forward
to a hopping good time...
in the Big Apple,
Mr. Centipede.
You said it, Mr. Grasshopper.
Oh, boy, what I wouldn't do
for a cup of coffee.
Cup ofjoe.
I say, old sport,
came to relieveyou ofyour duties.
I said I'd steer the peach.
Have to steer the peach.
Can't quit... now.
Good show, old boy.
Thanks... Mr. Grasshopper.
~~
- That music!
- Oh, SirJames! Did I disturbyou?
So sorry.
I'll put this away.
No, no. I like it.
I usedto hearit at myaunt's house
before I went tosleep.
That was you, wasn't it?
Or do all grasshoppers play music?
All grasshoppers... try.
I'm sureyou've heard this.
-
- Mm-hmm.
Ghastly, isn't it?
Cricket stuff.
Music should be
thevoice ofthe soul.
- What does that mean?
- It means thatwhen I'm happy,
my music sounds like this.
~~
-
-~~
When I'm sad,
it's like this.
~~
-~~
-When I was sad, I used to climb
in bed with my mom and dad.
But thatwas
a long time ago.
I'm sure they'd be
very proud ofyou,James.
I knowwe are.

- Look, everybody, we made it!
- We did?
-  New York City.
-  Breathtaking!
- Stunning!
- Glorious.
- Look at the park.
-  It's fabulous!
- We have made it!
What a wonderful sight!
There's Lady Liberty!
I can almost smell the lovely dirt.
- Is it not beautiful?
-  The Empire State Building.
- See those lights!
-
Wa-hoo! Yippee!
Atta boy,Jimmy!
Good show,James.
The city awaits us.
Now remember,James,
first impression is very important.
- Oh, no!
-
We'll be blown offcourse.
- We'll wind up in Jersey!
-
- Could it be--
- No, it couldn't be.
-
- It's the rhino!
Oh,James, do something.
-
-
Everyone, climb up
into the rigging!
Hurry!
James, areyou not
coming with us?
No!
- It got my mum and dad!
Itwon't get myfriends!
-
Come out and showyourface,
you stupid beast!
Good God Almighty!
- Rememberwhat
your parents said,James!
-
"Try looking at it
anotherway!"
You're not even
a real rhino!
-
- You'rejust a lot ofsmoke andnoise!
I'm not afraid ofyou!
I'm not afraid ofyou!
Ja--James!
Noo-oo!
-
-
Miss Spider?
Mr. Grasshopper?
Hello?
Is anyone there?
-
-
This isn't right.
Where's the
Empire State Building?
What the--
Officer!
There's a boyup there!
What?
A boy?
Mabel, we got us
a huge unidentified object here!
- What's it look like?
- Round, fuzzy. It looks sorta like
a giant fruit or something.
- Well, what is it?
- I don't knowwhat it is!
Just send us the biggest crane
in NewYork!
- Please, sir. How do I get
to the Empire State Building?
- You're on top ofit, kid?
We made it!
Well, I made it.
- Hang on.
-
Haveyou seen
any big bugs tonight?
- Big bugs? How big?
-
I hope they're all right.
Let's go. Let's go.
Stay back. Stay back.
Don't worry, kid.
You'll be all right.
Come on, sonny.
Don't be afraid now. I got you.
Stayawayfrom those trucks!
What is this thing?
- Where you from?
- Whyyou here?
- Who? What? Where? When? Why?
- Holdyour fire, fellas!
He's just a kid, for Pete's sake.
Here, I got you.
It's okay, little guy.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
No.
-
-
Oh! Aaah!
Hello.
Little angel.
- So kindofyou to look after
ourlittle lost lamb.
- Oh.
- Who are you?
- We are the boy's legal guardians.
We've missed him
so much.
So we'lljust
take him home now.
And the peach, of course.
We're taking that as well.
Well, wait a minute.
Back up.
You mean to tell me
that this thing is a peach?
- It's not a peach. It's our peach.
- Our peach.
- Show him, Spongy.
- Yes.
- Looks like it's theirpeach all right.
- Yes!
- Yes. We're very proud of it.
- We're going to be in the record books.
It's not their peach.
The old man gave the green things to me.
- That's what made it grow.
- How dareyou disagree with us!
Patience, sister.
Remember his... condition.
- His condition?
- He's a chronic liar.
Sad, really.
He needs his treatment.
Well, that's whywe're here;
to bring him home.
So, you come here with us,
hey, lovey!
I'm not the one who's lying.
They are!
As you can see, Officer, it is urgent
thatyou release him to us immediately.
Let the boy speak!
All right, all right, all right!
Let's get to the bottom ofthis!
This thing is a peach.
Now, all right.
I'll buythat.
Now, does somebodywanna
tell me how it got here?
We attached it
to a hundred sea gulls.
Sea gulls?
That's what happened!
Me and Miss Spider and the Centipede
and the Old Green Grasshopper.
-
- I think he's gone mad.
This is all something
he dreamed up.
Well, maybe it started that way,
as a dream, but doesn't everything?
Those buildings,
these lights,
this whole city!
Somebody had to dream about it first,
and maybe that's what I did.
I dreamedabout coming here,
but then I didit!
- The poor boy needs his medicine.
- Yes.
- So we'll just take him.
- And the peach.
Back to our cozy
little house on the hill.
- Come along. You're going home with us.
- No, I'm not.
-
- What did you say?
I said...
no... I'm... not!
I hate that house and that cold room
and how I was always hungry.
All right, that's enough!
- And how you beat me!
-  He's lying!
-
- And told me I was nothing!
- Shut up!
- Shut up! Shut up!
No, not this time!
I flew the giant peach
across the ocean.
I landed on top of
the tallest building in theworld.
I made it! I'm not the one
who's nothing. You are!
AndI'm nevergoingback withyou!
Not me andnot thepeach.
How dareyou speak
to us this way.
-  Aaah!
-
James! Up here.
Hello, we're here.
-  Hey, buddy!
- What are they?
-  Young James.
- Hey,J immy.
- Bugs!
-
Need a little help down there?
- Giant bugs!
-
Hey, you old biddies!
-
- Help us!
- Whoo-ee! Here we are, dear.
- Hello,James!
I told you
theywere real.
- Hello, old boy.
- Requesting clearance to land.
Miss Spider,
throw me a string!
-
- Okay, pull them up.
Help!
Where are we going?
- Spin them around!
- You little--
Wrap them tightly!
Tighter! Tighter!
Well, I'll be a--
- The kid was tellin' the truth.
-
Get those two creeps
outta here!
Stop the presses. I got a new front
page. " Big Bugs In The Big Apple."
In big bold print:
" Little Lindy Flies Giant Peach."
" Half-Pint Hero
And His Peach Pit Pals."
Everyone,
these are myfriends;
the ones I've been tellingyou about.
- Mr. Centipede!
- Hi.
- Old Green Grasshopper!
- My pleasure.
- Earthworm! Mrs. Ladybug!
- Charmed.
- Miss Spider!
-
- And the Glowworm!
- God bless the colonies!
Could we eat some
ofyour peach?
- It won't keep forever.
- Go ahead.
Hey!
What was your name?
It's James!
They ate that
peach all the way down to the pit.
Andset it up in Central Park
as a permanent home.
AndJames Henry Trotter,
who once was the saddest and loneliest
little boyyou could find,
now had a loving new family...
and all the friends
in the world.
-J ames, di nner is ready.
- Hi, Miss Spider.
All right.
Nearly finished.
And-- And then--
And then the sea gulls--
AndsinceJames's visitors
beggedhim again andagain...
to hear the story ofhis adventure
with the giant peach,
he wished for a way
to share it with everyone.
And that is exactly...
what you have just seen.
