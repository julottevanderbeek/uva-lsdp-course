Oh, Brad,
wasn't it wonderful?
Didn't Betty look
radiantly beautiful?
I can't believe it.
just an hour ago, she was
plain Betty Munroe,
and now she's
Mrs. Ralph Hapschatt.
Ohh. Yes, Janet,
Ralph's a lucky guy.
Yes.
And everyone knows
Betty is a wonderful
little cook.
Yes.
And Ralph himself will be
in line for promotion
in a year or two.
Yes.
Hey, Janet?
Yes, Brad?
I-I-I got something to say.
Yes?
I really loved
the skillful way...
Yes?
...you beat the other girls
to the bride's bouquet.
Oh, Brad.
THE RIVER WAS DEEP,
BUT I SWAM IT
JANET
THE FUTURE IS OURS,
SO LET'S PLAN IT
JANET
SO PLEASE,
DON'T TELL ME TO CAN IT
JANET
I'VE ONE THING TO SAY,
AND THAT'S, "DAMN IT, JANET
I LOVE YOU"
THE ROAD WAS LONG,
BUT I RAN IT
JANET
THERE'S A FIRE IN MY HEART,
AND YOU FAN IT
JANET
IF THERE'S ONE FOOL FOR YOU,
THEN I AM IT
JANET
I'VE ONE THING TO SAY,
AND THAT'S, "DAMN IT, JANET
I LOVE YOU"
HERE'S THE RING TO PROVE
THAT I'M NO JOKER
BUM-BUM-BUM-BUM
THERE'S THREE WAYS
THAT LOVE
CAN GROW
OOH, OOH, OOH
THAT'S GOOD, BAD,
OR MEDIOCRE
J-A-N-E-T,
I LOVE YOU SO
OH! IT'S NICER

OH, BRAD

AND I'M SO GLAD
OH, BRAD
THAT YOU MET MOM
AND YOU KNOW DAD
OH, BRAD
I'VE ONE THING TO SAY,

FOR YOU, TOO"
OH, BRAD
OH, DAMN IT
I'M MAD
OH, JANET!

I LOVE YOU, TOO

JANET
MADE ME GIVE YOU THE EYE

JANET
I'VE ONE THING TO SAY,

I LOVE YOU"
DAMN IT, JANET
OH, BRAD, I'M MAD
DAMN IT, JANET
I LOVE YOU
You smell.
I would like, if I may...
Audience: YOU MAY!
...to take you...
TAKE ME!
Perhaps later.
...on a strange journey...
HOW STRANGE?
Oh, you'd be surprised.
It seemed a fairly
ordinary night...
ORDINARY?
Mm.
When Brad Majors...
ARSEHOLE!
You've met.
and his fiancé --
or do you prefer fiancée? --
Janet Weiss...
SLUT!
Two ordinary, healthy kids...
HEALTHY?
Mm, -ish.
left Denton that late
"Nomever" evening...
...left Denton that late
evening...
to visit a Dr. Everett Scott.
ex-science tutor,
and now friend to both of them.
It's true that there were dark
storm clouds...
DESCRIBE YOUR BALLS!
Heavy, black,
and pendulous.
Curses upon you.
...towards which
they were driving.
It's true also that the spare
tire they were carrying
was badly in need of some air.
BLOW JOB!
Yes, please.
but they, being normal kids
and on a night out, well...
IT WAS A NIGHT IN!
they were not going to let
a storm spoil the events
of their evening.
CERTAINLY NOT!
No.
On a night out...
IT WAS A NIGHT IN!
On a night out --
IT WAS A NIGHT IN!
and we --
Oh, have it your own way.
...they were to remember...
FOR HOW LONG?!
For a very, very long time.
Hmm.
What's the matter,
Brad, darling?
Uh...I think we took the wrong
fork a few miles back there.
We better go on ahead
up the road
and see if we can find
our way back.
Oh, darn, Janet!
what was that bang?
Audience: GANG BANG!
We seem to have a blowout in
the front left-hand tire.
Ohh.
You better stay here and keep
warm while I go for help.
But where will you go?
we're in the middle of nowhere.
DIDN'T YOU PASS A CASTLE
BACK DOWN THE ROAD A FEW MILES?
Hmm.
Didn't we pass a castle back
down the road a few miles?
Maybe they have a telephone
I might use.
I'm coming with you.
THAT'LL BE A FIRST!
There's no point in both
of us getting wet.
I'm coming with you.
Besides, darling,
the owner of the phone
may be a beautiful woman.
HE IS!
And you may never come back.
IN THE VELVET DARKNESS
OF THE BLACKEST NIGHT
BURNING BRIGHT
THERE'S A GUIDING STAR
NO MATTER WHAT
OR
WHO YOU A-A-A-RE
THERE'S A LIGHT
OVER AT
THE FRANKENSTEIN PLACE
THERE'S A LIGHT
BURNING IN THE FIREPLACE
THERE'S A LIGHT, LIGHT
IN THE DARKNESS
OF EVERYBODY'S LIFE
I CAN SEE THE FLAG FLY
I CAN SEE THE RAIN
JUST THE SAME
WELL, THERE HAS GOT TO BE
SOMETHING BETTER HERE FOR
YOU AND ME
THERE'S A LIGHT
OVER AT
THE FRANKENSTEIN PLACE
THERE'S A LIGHT
BURNING IN THE FIREPLACE
THERE'S A LIGHT, LIGHT
IN THE DARKNESS
OF EVERYBODY'S LIFE
THE DARKNESS MUST GO
DOWN THE RIVER
OF NIGHT'S DREAMING
FLOW MORPHIUS SLOW
LET THE SUN AND LIGHT
COME STREAMING
INTO MY LIFE
INTO MY LI-I-I-I-I-I-FE
LIFE!
THERE'S A LIGHT
OVER AT
THE FRANKENSTEIN PLACE
THERE'S A LIGHT
BURNING IN THE FIREPLACE
THERE'S A LIGHT, LIGHT
IN THE DARKNESS
OF EVERYBODY'S LIFE
Oh!
It's all right, Janet.
Oh, Brad, let's go back.
I'm cold, and I'm frightened.
Well, just a moment, Janet.
They may have a telephone.
Audience: ARSEHOLE CALLING!
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE
LIONEL RICHIE SONG?!
HELLO.
Oh, uh, hi there.
We're in a bit of a spot.
I wonder, could you help us?
Our car has broken down
about two miles back.
Do you have a telephone
we might use?
You're wet.
SHE'S ALWAYS WET!
YES.
It's been raining.
Yes.
Yes.
I think perhaps you'd better
both  --
Come inside.
Uh...thank you.
You're too kind.
"You're too kind."
And so...
after braving
the inclement weather
in some not too little time,
it seemed that fortune
had smiled on Brad and Janet,
and that they had found
the assistance
that their plight required.
ARE YOU SURE?
I'm not quite,
but we'll find out.
There was certainly something
about this castle
to which a flat tire and a wet
night had brought them,
and it made them
both feel...
HORNY!
That's not what it says here.
...apprehensive and uneasy.
But if they were to reach
their destination that night,
they would have to ignore such
feelings and take advantage...
OF EACHOTHER!
...of whatever help was offered.
Wait here.
HE SAID WAIT THERE!
Oh... oh, Brad, what sort
of a place is this?
It's probably some sort of a
hunting lodge for rich weirdoes.
IT'S A CASTLE!
I'll keep a look out
for the undertaker.
I'm scared.
Oh, for god's sake, keep a grip
on yourself, Janet.
I'm here.
there's nothing to worry about.
It's all right, Janet.
Excuse me. Hi.
Uh, look, if we could just use
your phone,
we'll move right along.
I'm sure you got
lots of things to do
and a great evening planned.
Oh, yes.
You've arrived on a rather
special night.
HURRY UP, THEN!
The master is having one of
his affairs.
Lucky old him..
Yeah. He's lucky.
I'm lucky.
You're lucky.
We're all lucky!
All except Eddie.
Shh!
Eddie?
Shh!
The delivery boy.
His delivery
wasn't good enough.
The master only wanted to help
the boy better his position.
Oh, that's very commendable.
Yes. it seems like only
yesterday since he went.
Where?
To pieces!
IT'S ASTOUNDING
TIME IS FLEETING
MADNESS TAKES ITS TOLL
BUT LISTEN CLOSELY
NOT FOR VERY MUCH LONGER
I'VE GOT TO KEEP CONTROL
I REMEMBER
DOING THE TIME WARP
DRINKING THOSE MOMENTS WHEN
THE BLACKNESS WOULD HIT ME
AND THE VOID WOULD BE CALLING
LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN
LET'S DO
THE TIME WARP AGAIN
It's just a jump to the left...
AND THEN A STEP TO THE RI-I-I-I-GHT
with your hands on your hips...
YOU BRING YOUR KNEES IN TIGHT
BUT IT'S THE PELVIC THRUST
THAT REALLY DRIVES YOU INSA-A-A-A-A-NE
LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN
LET'S DO
THE TIME WARP AGAIN
IT'S SO DREAMY
OH, FANTASY, FREE ME!
SO YOU CAN'T SEE ME
NO, NOT AT ALL
IN ANOTHER DIMENSION
WITH VOYEURISTIC INTENTION
WELL SECLUDED
I SEE ALL
WITH A BIT OF A MIND FLIP
YOU'RE INTO THE TIME SLIP
AND NOTHING
CAN EVER BE THE SAME
YOU'RE SPACED OUT ON SENSATION
LIKE YOU'RE UNDER SEDATION
LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN
LET'S DO
THE TIME WARP AGAIN
WELL, I WAS TAPPING DOWN THE STREET
JUST A-HAVING A THINK
WHEN A SNAKE OF A GUY
GAVE ME AN EVIL WINK
IT SHOOK-A ME UP,
IT TOOK ME BY SURPRISE
HE HAD A PICKUP TRUCK
AND THE DEVIL'S EYES
HE STARED AT ME,
AND I FELT A CHANGE
TIME MEANT NOTHING,
NEVER WOULD AGAIN
LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN
LET'S DO
THE TIME WARP AGAIN
Whoo!
LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN
LET'S DO
THE TIME WARP AGAIN
It's just a jump to the left...
AND THEN A STEP
TO THE RI-I-I-I-GHT
with your hands on your hips...
YOU BRING YOUR KNEES IN TIGHT
BUT IT'S THE PELVIC THRUST
THAT REALLY DRIVES YOU INSA-A-A-A-A-NE
LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN
LET'S DO
THE TIME WARP AGAIN
Whoo!
Wow! Whoo!
Say something, Brad!
Oh! Do you guys know
how to Madison?
Oh, Brad, let's get out of here.
It seems so unhealthy!
I'm cold, and I'm wet,
and I'm just plain scared!
I'm here, Janet.
there's nothing to worry about.
Brad, I want to go!
HOW D'YOU DO? I
SEE YOU'VE MET MY
FAITHFUL HANDYMAN
HE'S A LITTLE BROUGHT DOWN BECAUSE
WHEN YOU KNOCKED
HE THOUGHT YOU WERE THE CANDY MAN
Didn't you, Freaky?
DON'T GET STRUNG OUT
BY THE WAY I LOOK
DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER
I'M NOT MUCH OF A MAN
BY THE LIGHT OF DAY
BUT BY NIGHT,
I'M ONE HELL OF A LOVER
I'M JUST A SWEET TRANSVESTITE
SWEET TRANSVESTITE
FROM TRANSSEXUAL
TRANSYLVANIA
UH-HUH
SO, LET ME SHOW YOU AROUND, MAYBE
PLAY YOU A SOUND
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE BOTH PRETTY GROOVY
OR IF YOU WANT SOMETHING VISUAL
THAT'S NOT TOO ABYSMAL
WE COULD TAKE IN
AN OLD STEVE REEVES MOVIE
I'm glad we caught you
at home.
Uh, could we use your phone?
We're both in a bit of a hurry.
Right.
We'll just
say where we are,
then get back to the car.
We don't want to be
any worry.
SO, YOU GOT CAUGHT
WITH A FLAT, WELL
HOW 'BOUT THAT?
WELL, BABIES, DON'T YOU PANIC
BY THE LIGHT OF THE NIGHT
IT'LL ALL SEEM ALL RIGHT
I'LL GET YOU A SATANIC MECHANIC
I'M JUST A SWEET TRANSVESTITE
SWEET TRANSVESTITE
FROM TRANSSEXUAL
TRANSYLVANIA
UH-HUH
WHY DON'T YOU STAY FOR THE NIGHT?
NIGHT
OR MAYBE A BITE
BITE
I COULD SHOW YOU
MY FAVORITE OBSESSION
I'VE BEEN MAKING A MAN
WITH DARK HAIR AND A TAN
AND HE'S GOOD OR RELIEVING MY
TCH, TCH, TCH, TCH,
TCH, TCH, TCH
TENSION!
I'M JUST A SWEET TRANSVESTITE
OOH, OOH, OOH
FROM TRANSSEXUAL
TRANSYLVANIA, HA HA
HIT IT, HIT IT!
I'M JUST A SWEET TRANSVESTITE
SWEET, SWEET
FROM TRANSSEXUAL
TRANSYLVANIA
UH-HUH
So...come up to the lab...
and see what's on the slab.
I see you shiver with antici...
: SAY IT! SAY IT!
SAY IT! SAY IT!
pation.
BUT MAYBE THE RAIN
IS REALLY TO BLAME
SO I'LL REMOVE THE CAUSE
BUT NOT THE SYMPTOM
It's all right, Janet.
It's all right.
Everything's gonna be all right.
we'll just play along for now
and pull out the aces when
the time is right.
This is no time
for card tricks, Brad.
Are you sure
we'll be all right?
I'm sure, Janet.
Hi, there.
I'm Brad Majors.
ARSEHOLE!
And, uh, this is my fiancée
Janet Weiss.
SLUT!
You are?
You're very lucky to be invited
up to Frank's laboratory.
A lot of people would give their
right arm for the privilege.
People like you, maybe.
I've seen it.
Is he --
is Frank your husband?
The master is not yet married.
Nor do I think ever will be.
We are simply his servants.
Janet!
Brad!
Janet!
Brad...
Unlock a mind, un-mind a lock.
It's the same as the beginning
of the end -- do you follow?
No.
Well, it's an anagram, Janet.
I wonder, may I offer you
something refreshing?
: No.
No, you're right.
I won't.
How delightful to have
fresh faces around!
Uh, Magenta, Columbia,
go and assist Riff Raff
while I entertain, uh...
Brad Majors.
Brad Majors.
And, uh, this is my fiancée,
Janet Vice.
Weiss.
Weiss.
Enchanté.
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?
How nice.
And what charming underclothes
you both have.
But, here, put these on.
It'll make you feel less...
NAKED!
...Vulnerable.
We don't often
receive visitors here,
let alone offer them hospitality.
Hospitality?
Mm.
All we wanted was to
use your phone.
A reasonable request which you
have chosen to ignore!
Don't be ungrateful, Brad.
Ungrateful?!
How forceful you are, Brad!
LIKE MARGARET THATCHER!
What a perfect example
of manhood.
So dominant.
You must be very proud, Janet.
Well...yes, I am.
Mm.
Tell me, Brad,
do you have any tattoos?
Certainly not.
Mnh!
Oh, well.
How about you?
Oh...
Stop, stop.
Everything is in readiness, Master.
We merely wait for you
to give the word.
Tonight, Brad and Janet,
you are to witness a
new breakthrough
in biochemical research,
and paradise is to be mine.
Well, how wonderful for you.
It's strange the way it happened.
Uh, one of those
quirks of fate, really.
One of those moments when
everything looks black.
The chips are down,
your back's against the wall,
You panic.
You're trapped!
there's no way out!
And even if there were,
it would probably be a one-way
ticket to the bottom of the bay.
And then, suddenly, you get a break.
All of the pieces
seem to fit into place.
What a sucker you'd been.
What a fool!
The answer was there
all the time.
It took a small accident
to make it happen.
Accident?
An
It's how I discovered the secret.
That elusive ingredient,
that spark that is the
breath of life.
Yes, I have that knowledge.
I hold the key
to life itself!
Mm-mrrm!
So, you see, Brad and Janet,
you really are quite fortunate,
for tonight is the night
my beautiful creature is
destined to be born.
Throw open the switches on
the sonic oscillator!
And step up
the reactor power input!
Oh!
Three more points!
Ohhh!
THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES IS
HANGIN' OVER MY HEAD
AND I'VE GOT A FEELING
SOMEONE'S GONNA
BE CUTTIN' THE THREAD
OH! OH, HO!
OH, WOE IS ME
MY LIFE IS A MISERY
AND CAN'T YOU SEE
THAT I'M AT THE
START OF A PRETTY BIG DOWNER?
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING
WITH A START AS I FELL OUT OF BED
THAT AIN'T NO CRIME
AND LEFT FROM MY DREAMIN'
WAS A FEELING OF UNNAMEABLE DREAD
THAT AIN'T NO CRIME
MY HIGH IS LOW
I'M DRESSED UP
WITH NO PLACE TO GO
AND ALL I KNOW
IS I'M AT THE
START OF A PRETTY BIG DOWNER
SHA-LA-LA-LA, THAT AIN'T NO CRIME
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA
SHA-LA-LA-LA, THAT AIN'T NO CRIME
OH, NO, NO
SHA-LA-LA-LA, THAT AIN'T NO CRIME,
THAT AIN'T NO CRIME
Rocky Horror,
you need peace of mind.
I want to tell you
that you're doing just fine.
You're the product of
another time,
so feeling low, well,
that's no crime.
THAT AIN'T NO CRIME
THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES IS
HANGIN' OVER MY HEAD
THAT AIN'T NO CRIME
AND I'VE GOT A FEELING
SOMEONE'S GONNA BE CUTTIN'
THE THREAD
THAT AIN'T NO CRIME
OH, WOE IS ME
MY LIFE IS A MISERY
AND CAN'T YOU SEE
THAT I'M AT THE
START OF A PRETTY BIG DOWNER?
SHA-LA-LA-LA, THAT AIN'T NO CRIME
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA
SHA-LA-LA-LA, THAT AIN'T NO CRIME
NO, NO, NO
SHA-LA-LA-LA, THAT AIN'T NO CRIME
THAT AIN'T NO CRIME
SHA-LA-LA!
Well, now, that's no way
to behave on your first day out.
Well, nobody's perfect.
Audience: YOU ARE!
But I do think you made a pretty
good job of the bodywork.
OOH!
You are the result of
many hours of toil.
AND WANKING!
And now,
my beautiful creature,
you're ready for the ultimate test.
Uh-oh.
heh, heh.
But first, meet the family.
UH, OOH!
Magenta, Rocky.
Hello, Rocky.
Hello, Magenta.
Oh!
Uh, Riff Raff, Rocky.
Hello, Rocky.
HELLO, RIFF RAFF.
Aww!
Columbia, Rocky.
Hello, Rocky!
Hello, Columbia!
A-ha ha!
Well, what do you think?
He is a credit to my --
your genius.
A-a triumph of the will.
He's okay!
"Okay"?
"Okay."
I think we can do better than that.
Well -- -- uh,
Brad and Janet,
What do you think?
I-- I don't like men with
too many muscles.
JUST ONE BIG ONE!
I didn't make him for you, dear.
He carries the Charles Atlas
seal of approval.
A WEAKLING
BRAD!
WEIGHING 98 POUNDS
WILL GET SAND IN HIS FACE
WHEN KICKED TO THE GROUND
SO SOON, IN THE GYM
WITH A DETERMINED CHIN
THE SWEAT FROM HIS PORES
AS HE WORKS FOR HIS CAU-U-U-SE
WILL MAKE HIM GLISTEN

AND WITH MASSAGE
AND JUST A LITTLE BIT OF
STE-E-E-E-E-AM
HE'LL BE FIT
AND QUITE LEAN
HE'LL BE A STRONG MAN
OH, HONEY
BUT THE WRONG MAN
HE'LL EAT NUTRITIOUS
HIGH PROTEIN, AND SWALLOW RAW EGGS
TRY TO BUILD UP HIS SHOULDERS
HIS CHEST, ARMS, AND LEGS
SUCH AN EFFORT!
IF HE ONLY KNEW OF MY PLAN
WHEN IN JUST SEVEN DAYS
I CAN MAKE YOU
A MA-A-A-A-A-N
HE'LL DO PRESS-UPS

I CAN MAKE YOU
A MA-A-A-A-A-N
Eddie!
-Eddie?
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO SATURDAY NIGHT?
WHEN YOU DRESSED UP SHARP
AND YOU FELT ALL RIGHT
IT DON'T SEEM THE SAME SINCE COSMIC LIGHT
CAME INTO MY LIFE,
I THOUGHT I WAS DIVINE
I USED TO GO FOR A RIDE WITH
A CHICK WHO'D GO
AND LISTEN TO THE MUSIC ON THE RADIO
A SAXOPHONE WAS BLOWING
ON A ROCK 'N' ROLL SHOW
CLIMB IN THE BACK
YOU REALLY HAD A GOOD TI-I-I-ME
HOT PATOOTIE, BLESS MY SOUL
I REALLY LOVE THAT ROCK 'N' ROLL
HOT PATOOTIE, BLESS MY SOUL
I REALLY LOVE THAT ROCK 'N' ROLL
MY HEAD USED TO SWIM FROM
THE PERFUME I SMELT
MY HANDS KIND OF FUMBLED WITH
HER WHITE PLASTIC BELT
I'D TASTE HER BABY PINK LIPSTICK
AND THAT'S WHEN I'D MELT
SHE'D WHISPER IN MY EAR
TONIGHT SHE REALLY WAS MINE
GET BACK IN FRONT
AND PUT SOME HAIR OIL ON
BUDDY HOLLY WAS SINGING
HIS VERY LAST SONG
WITH YOUR ARM AROUND YOUR GIRL
YOU TRY TO SING ALONG
IT FELT PRETTY GOOD, YOU
REALLY HAD A GOOD TI-I-I-ME
HOT PATOOTIE, BLESS MY SOUL
I REALLY LOVE THAT ROCK 'N' ROLL
HOT PATOOTIE, BLESS MY SOUL
I REALLY LOVE THAT ROCK 'N' ROLL
HOT PATOOTIE, BLESS MY SOUL
Whoo!
HOT PATOOTIE, BLESS MY SOUL
I REALLY LOVE THAT ROCK 'N' ROLL
HOT PATOOTIE, BLESS MY SOUL
I REALLY LOVE THAT ROCK ‘N’ ROLL
Shush!
HE'S DEAD, THEN?
One from the vault.
Ha, ha-ha, ha, ha.
Unh.
Ohh!
Ugh.
Ugh!
How could you keep him around?
He's so ugly.
We had a mental relationship.
Oh. he had a certain...
naive charm.
But no muscle.
Oh!
BUT A DELTOID AND A BICEP
OH, OH, OH
A HOT GROIN AND TRICEP

Oh! oh, Brad!
Oh, yes! Yes, my darling!
Oh, what if --
It's all right, Janet.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Oh, I hope so, my darling.
I'm scared.
You?!
I'm afraid so, Janet.
But wasn't it nice?
Oh!
Oh, you beast!
You monster!
What have you done with Brad?
Nothing.
Why, do you think I should?
Oh! You tricked me.
I wouldn't have.
I've never.
Never.
I know.
But it wasn't all bad, was it?
Mm.
Not really even half bad.
Mm.
In fact, I think perhaps you
found it quite pleasurable.
Mm.
Oh, so soft, so sensual...
Oh! No!
Stop...
I mean...help.
I...oh, Brad!
Oh...oh...
Brad!
Shhh! Brad is probably
asleep by now.
Do you want him to see
you like this?
Like this?
Like how?
It's your fault.
You're to blame.
I was saving myself.
Well, i'm sure
you're not spent yet.
And it was an enjoyable
experience, was it not?
Ooh, you did like it,
didn't you?
There's no crime
in giving yourself over
to pleasure, is there?
We could try for an action replay.
Ohh, Janet, you've wasted --
so much time already.
Brad needn't know.
I won't tell him.
Are you sure
you won't tell him?
Oh, yes! Oh!
There are those who say that
life is an illusion...
Audience: LIFE IS AN ILLUSION!
and that reality as we know it
is merely a figment of
our imaginations.
If this is so, then
Brad and Janet are quite safe.
There are those, however, with
a far more physical philosophy.
Those who would stop at nothing
to satisfy their base desires.
it could be that Brad and Janet
are amongst those
who hold the devil's reins.
Oh, Brad.
Oh, yes!
Yes, my darling!
It's all right, Janet.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Oh, I hope so, my darling.
You!
I'm afraid so, Brad.
But wasn't it nice?
Why, you!
What have you done with Janet?
Nothing.
Why, do you think
I should?
You tricked me!
I-I wouldn't have.
I've -- I've never -- never!
I know.
But it wasn't all bad, was it?
Mm.
Not really even half bad.
Mm.
In fact, I think perhaps you
found it quite pleasurable.
Mm.
So soft, so sensual.
Ohhhh!
Nooo, stop!
Oh, Janet! Janet!
Shhh-sha!
Janet is...
Janet i--
Janet is --
Janet is probably asleep by now.
Do you want her to see you
like this?
Like this?!
Like how?
it's your fault!
You're to blame!
I thought it was the real thing.
Oh, come on, Brad.
Admit it.
It was enjoyable, wasn't it?
You liked it, didn't you?
There's no crime in --
There's --
There...  there's no crime...
Whoa.
in giving yourself
over to pleasure, is there?
We could try for an action replay.
Oh, Brad.
You've wasted so much time already.
Janet needn't know.
I won't tell her.
Are you sure
you won't tell her?
:
Master, the laboratory is empty.
COMING!
Oh!
What's happening here?
Where's Brad?
Where's anybody?
WHOOO!
If only we hadn't made
this journey.
BUT YOU DID!
If only the car hadn't broken down.
BUT IT DID!
If only we were amongst friends.
BUT YOU'RE NOT!
Or sane persons.
WHOO!
"IF" and "ONLY,"
two small words...
Very good.
Throw him out.
Throw him out.
Words that kept repeating themselves
again and again in Janet's thoughts.
But it was too late
to go back now.
It was as if she were riding
a giant...
COCK!
I have "tidal wave," but cock is better.
It would be folly to fight against it.
Her only chance would be to ride
it out, adapt, and perhaps...
SWALLOW!
...Survive.
Thank you.
Oh, It's you!
Look, I'm trying to hide from
my creator and his minion.
They scare me.
I feel all is not well here.
I've been thinking a lot
about...
Sex!
Eddie.
I have a feeling of foreboding.
It's all like some terrible dream.
A WET DREAM!
Is it true you don't like men
with too many muscles?
Well, uh,
I'm engaged to Brad.
Just the same as Betty Munroe
was to Ralph Hapschatt.
But Frank's kisses overwhelmed
me with an ecstasy
I'd never dreamed of before.
Hot, burning kisses.
I could see Brad's face
before me,
and my mind screamed no,
but my lips were hungry.
Too hungry.
I wanted to be loved,
and loved completely.
My body throbbed excitedly.
Oh, Brad.
Brad, my darling, how could
I have done this to you?
This room is a womb to me.
A WOMB WITH A VIEW!
Yes. there, you see?
It's instinctive.
You returned here for one thing
and one thing only.
SEX!
Security.
Oh, where's Brad?
What have they done with him?
Janet's feelings ran wild...
as she frantically manipulated
the selector switch on
the TV monitor.
The screens threw up images
of empty rooms and corridors.
Finally, she stopped --
at Frank's bedroom.
Oh!
You can't rely on anyone.
Oh, Brad!
How could you?!
Tell us about it, Janet.
I WAS FEELING DONE IN
COULDN'T WIN
I'D ONLY EVER KISSED BEFORE
YOU MEAN SHE'S A --
UH-HUH.
I THOUGHT
THERE'S NO USE GETTING
INTO HEAVY PETTING
IT ONLY LEADS TO TROUBLE
AND SEAT WETTING
NOW ALL I WANT TO KNOW
IS HOW TO GO
I'VE TASTED BLOOD
AND I WANT MORE
MORE, MORE, MORE
I'LL PUT UP NO RESISTANCE
I WANT TO STAY THE DISTANCE
I'VE GOT AN ITCH TO SCRATCH
I NEED ASSISTANCE
TOUCH-A, TOUCH-A, TOUCH-A, TOUCH ME
I WANT TO BE DIRTY
THRILL ME, CHILL ME, FULFILL ME
CREATURE OF THE NIGHT
THEN IF ANYTHING GROWS
WHEN YOU POSE
I'LL OIL YOU UP
AND RUB YOU DOWN
DOWN, DOWN, DOWN
AND THAT'S
JUST ONE SMALL FRACTION
OF THE MAIN ATTRACTION
YOU NEED A FRIENDLY HAND
AND I NEED ACTION
TOUCH-A, TOUCH-A, TOUCH-A, TOUCH ME
I WANT TO BE DIRTY
THRILL ME, CHILL ME, FULFILL ME
CREATURE OF THE NIGHT
TOUCH-A, TOUCH-A, TOUCH-A, TOUCH ME
I WANT TO BE DIRTY
THRILL ME, CHILL ME, FULFILL ME
CREATURE OF THE NIGHT
TOUCH-A, TOUCH-A, TOUCH-A, TOUCH ME
I WANT TO BE DIRTY
THRILL ME, CHILL ME, FULFILL ME
CREATURE OF THE NIGHT
CREATURE  OF  THE  NIGHT
CREATURE OF THE NIGHT
CREATURE  OF  THE  NIGHT!
Aah!
OOH!
Mercy!
How did it happen?
Ooh!
I understood you were
to be watching!
I was only away for a moment.
Well, see if you can find him
on the monitor!
Very well.
I've located him...
Mm?
in the female's quarters.
Master!
Oh, Rocky. Rocky!
Rocky!
Oh, Janet.
Janet!
How could she?!
That's it...
It's over!
Over?
What was over?
My career, yes.
Actually, um,
y-you're kind of right.
It was pretty much
dead in the water.
until I discovered...
MINECRAFT!
Thank you.
It's got a lovely rise, actually.
It's got a lovely rise.
And a great...
SOGGY BOTTOM!
Show us -- yes, my bottom
is extremely soggy, sir.
I'm so sorry.
PIECE OF CAKE!
Not the --
That was such a bad mistake.
Not the night,
that was certain --
Sorry about the front row.
You're getting a lot of
red velvet.
Just spat.   I'm sorry.
Brad and Janet's engagement?
Their love for one another?
Who -- sorry.
Oh, it's a very rich icing
that's going down the throat, there.
Very rich icing.
Let's -- let's get back.
Let's get back.
Their love for one another?
Who could say?
Too perky!
For questions such as these...
are not to be answered by
the academic;
they must be left
for the heart to solve.
And Brad, you may be sure,
had plenty of heart.
ONCE IN A WHILE
SHE DON'T WANT TO CALL YOU
SPEAKING ON THE TELEPHONE
AND ONCE IN YOUR LIFE
SHE WON'T WANT TO KNOW YOU
YOU LOOK AROUND
THE ONE YOU'VE FOUND
SHE IS GONE
AND THAT'S ALL THE TIME
THAT IT TAKES
FOR A HEART
TO TURN TO STONE
THE SWEETER THE WINE
THE HARDER TO MAKE THE BREAK
YOU HEAR SOMETHING
ABOUT SOMEONE
YOU THOUGHT YOU'D KNOWN
SO, BABY DON'T CRY
LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW
AFTER THE NIGHT
THERE'S A BRAND-NEW DAY
AND THERE'LL BE NO PAIN
AND NO MORE SORROW
SO WASH YOUR FACE
AND PHONE MY PLACE
IT'LL BE OKAY
AND THAT'S ALL THE TIME
THAT IT TAKES
FOR A HEART TO BEAT AGAIN
SO GIVE ME A SIGN
THAT A LOVER MAKES
YOU LOOK AROUND
THE ONE YOU'VE FOUND
IS BACK AGAIN
IS  BACK  AGAIN
How maudlin.
How pathetic.
Your baggage has dared to
defile my beautiful creature.
Oh, Rocky, how could you?
Master!
We have a visitor!
Ooh!
Great Scott, Scottie!
Dr. Everett Scott!
SIEG HEIL!
You know this Earthling?
Gah!
I mean, "person."
Why, yes, I do.
He's an old friend of mine.
I see.
So, this wasn't simply a chance
meeting after all.
You came here with a purpose.
That's not true.
My car broke down.
I told you.
I know what you told me, Brad.
But this Dr. Everett Scott,
His name is not unknown to me.
Well, he was a science teacher
at Denton High.
And now he works for your
government, doesn't he, Brad?
He's attached to the bureau of
the investigation
of that which you call
U.F.O.s!
That's right, isn't it, Brad?
Well, he might be.
I don't know.
OOH...
The intruder's
entered the building, Master.
Ah, he's in the zen room.
Seal off all exits and all doors
except for those that lead here.
Riff Raff, bring Rocky and Janet.
I think we should make this
a social occasion.
The three unexpected guests
shall entertain us with
a floor show,
which I shall direct.
Dr. Scott!
Brad!
What are you doing here?
Don't play games, Dr. Scott.
It was part of your plan,
was it not?
That Brad Majors and his female
should check the layout for you?
Heh!    Unfortunately for you all,
there is to be a change of plan.
I'm sure you're adaptable,
Dr. Scott.
I know Brad is.
I can assure you that
Brad's presence
comes as a
complete surprise to me.
As does this setup you have here.
I didn't expect it to
be quite so...
Sophisticated, Dr. Scott...
or should i say
Dr.  Scott?
They never proved nothing!
What exactly are you implying?
That's all right, Brad.
Ah, what exotic container
you have there?
What do you think it is, Doc?
.
At this precise moment,
it's hard to tell.
But it seems to be made of a
metal that is not of this earth.
I would say it came from
another...
IKEA!
...planet!
Brad!
Janet!
Rocky!
Dr. Scott?
Brad!
Janet!
Rocky!
Dr. Scott?
Brad!
Janet!
Rocky!
Dr. Scott?
Rocky!
Piss off!
Listen, you -- I made you, and I
can break you just as easily.
I'll pull your plug out.
I suppose you intend to do
with us as you did with Eddie?
Eddie?!
Shh!
Eddie! I've seen him.
He looked terrible.
Uh, what do you know of Eddie,
Dr. Scott?
I happen to know a great deal
about a lot of things.
You see, Eddie happened to be
my nephew!
Dr. Scott!
Yes, Brad.
My sister's son.
I knew he was in with
a bad crowd,
but it was
worse than I imagined!
MUTANTS!
Aliens!
Aliens?!
Tell 'em, Doc.
FROM THE DAY HE WAS BORN
HE WAS TROUBLE
OOH, AHH
HE WAS THE THORN
IN HIS MOTHER'S SIDE
OOH, AHH
SHE TRIED IN VAIN...
OOH, OOH, OOH
BUT HE NEVER CAUSED HER
NOTHING BUT PAIN
HE LEFT HOME THE DAY SHE DIED
FROM THE DAY SHE WAS GONE
ALL HE WANTED
WAS ROCK-'N'-ROLL, PORN
AND A MOTORBIKE
: VROOM! VROOM!
SHOOTING UP JUNK
HE WAS A LOWDOWN,
CHEAP LITTLE PUNK
TAKING EVERYONE FOR A RIDE
WHEN EDDIE SAID HE DIDN'T
LIKE HIS TEDDY
YOU KNEW HE WAS
A NO-GOOD KID
BUT WHEN HE THREATENED YOUR
LIFE WITH A SWITCHBLADE KNIFE
WHAT A GUY
MAKES YOU CRY
AND I DID
EVERYBODY SHOVED HIM
I VERY NEARLY LOVED HIM
I SAID,
"HEY, LISTEN TO ME
STAY SANE INSIDE INSANITY"
BUT HE LOCKED THE DOOR
AND THREW AWAY THE KEY
BUT HE MUST HAVE BEEN DRAWN
INTO SOMETHING
MAKING HIM WARN ME
IN A NOTE WHICH READS...
:  WHAT'S IT SAY?! WHAT'S IT SAY?!
"I'M OUT OF MY HEAD,
"HURRY, OR I MAY BE DEAD
THEY MUSTN'T CARRY OUT
THEIR EVIL DEEDS!"
WHEN EDDIE SAID HE DIDN'T
LIKE HIS TEDDY
YOU KNEW HE WAS
A NO-GOOD KID
BUT WHEN HE THREATENED YOUR
LIFE WITH A SWITCHBLADE KNIFE
WHAT A GUY
MAKES YOU CRY
AND I DID
WHEN EDDIE SAID HE DIDN'T
LIKE HIS TEDDY
YOU KNEW HE WAS A NO-GOOD KID
BUT WHEN HE THREATENED YOUR
LIFE WITH A SWITCHBLADE KNIFE
WHAT A GUY
MAKES YOU CRY
AND I DID
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA
WHAT A GUY
MAKES YOU CRY
AND I DID
HEY, HEY, HEY
WHAT A GUY
MAKES YOU CRY
AND I DID
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH
WHAT A GU-U-UY
MAKES YOU CRY-Y-Y
AND I DID
AND HE DID, YES, HE DID
EDDIE
Say a prayer for Eddie.
I just defrosted him.
His destiny is in the bag.
Waah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Waah!
Aah!
Waah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Waah!
Aah!
Waah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Waah!
Aah!
Piss off!
I'll put him down the
waste disposal.
Clever girl.
Why, you --
There.
That should restrain you all.
My feet!
I can't move my feet!
My wheels! My God,
I can't move my wheels!
It's as if we were glued
to the spot.
You are!
so quake with fear
you tiny fools, okay?
It's star time!
Riff Raff, set the sonic
transducer on program eight.
Secure all levels at zero.
You won't find Earth people
quite the easy mark you imagine!
This sonic ‘transjuicer’, it is,
I suppose, some type of
audio-vibratory physio-molecular
transport device.
You better believe it, Baby.
What? You mean he's gonna send
us to another planet?
Planet, shmanet, Janet.
I'LL TELL YOU ONCE,
I WON'T TELL YOU TWICE
YOU'D BETTER WISE UP,
JANET WEISS
YOUR APPLE PIE
DON'T TASTE TOO NICE
YOU'D BETTER WISE UP,
JANET WEISS
UNH!
I'VE LAID THE SEED
IT SHOULD BE ALL YOU NEED
YOU'RE AS SENSUAL
AS A PENCIL
WOUND UP LIKE
AN "E" ON FIRST STRING
WHEN WE MADE IT,
DID YOU HEAR A BELL RING?
YOU GOT A BLOCK?
TAKE MY ADVICE
YOU'D BETTER WISE UP,
JANET WEISS
THE TRANSDUCER
WILL SEDUCE YA
IT'S SOMETHING
YOU'LL GET USED TO
A MENTAL MIND-
CAN BE NICE
YOU'D BETTER WISE UP,
JANET WEISS
YOU'D BETTER WISE UP
BUILD YOUR THIGHS UP
YOU'D BETTER WISE UP
ST-O-O-OP!
DON'T GET
HOT AND FLUSTERED
USE A BIT OF MUSTARD
:  YOU'RE A HOT DOG
BUT YOU BETTER NOT
TRY TO HURT HER
FRANK FURTER
YOU'RE A HOT DOG
BUT YOU'D BETTER NOT
TRY TO HURT HER
FRANK FURTER
YOU'RE A HOT DOG
BUT YOU'D BETTER NOT
TRY TO HURT HER
FRANK FURTER
YOU'RE A HOT DOG
BUT YOU'D BETTER NOT
TRY TO HURT HER
FRANK FURTER
YOU'RE A HOT DOG
BUT YOU BETTER --
Magenta.
NOT TRY TO HURT HER
FRANK FURTER
YOU'RE A HOT DOG
Magenta!
Relax.
Columbia, the artistes are in
a molecular state
somewhere between entrance and exit.
When they have
pulled themselves together,
see to it that they are prepared
for the floor show.
My God!
I can't take any more of this.
First you ditch me for Eddie,
and then you throw him off
like an old overcoat for Rocky!
You chew people up, and then you
spit them out again.
I loved you!
Do you hear?
I loved you.
and what did I get?
I'll tell you.
A big fat nothing!
You're like a sponge --
you take, take, take,
and drain others of their affections.
Well, I've had it!
Ah!
I'm out of here.
and I mean --
Whoa!
Do that again.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Oh, I dig that!
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!
It's wicked!
Oooh!
Rowr!
Oh, it's a gas!
It's a gas, it's a gas, it's a
gas, it's a gas, it's a gas!
Mmmm!
OH!
I'm groovy.
Oh, I am hip, man!
Pow!
Pa-pow! Pa-pow! Pa-pow!
Ohhh.
It's like a trip.
Ohhh, freak out!
Baby!
Pbht!
Dig ya later!
It's not easy
having a good time.
Even smiling
makes my face ache.
And my children --
my children turn on me.
Rocky is behaving just as
Eddie did.
Ugh.
Maybe I made a mistake,
splitting the one brain between
the two of them.
When will we return to Transylvania?
I grow weary of this world.
Magenta...
I am indeed...
...grateful...
to both you
and your brother, Riff Raff.
You have both served  well.
Loyalty such as yours...
must be rewarded.
And you will discover that,
when the mood takes me,
I can be quite generous.
I ask for nothing!
Master.
And you shall receive it...
in abundance!
Mmmmmm!
Ohhhh!
Ohhhh!
And so,
by some extraordinary
coincidence,
fate, it seems, had decided that
Brad and Janet
should keep their appointment
with their friend, Dr. Everett Scott.
SIEG HEIL!
Gesundheit.
But it was to be in a situation
which none of them
could possibly have foreseen.
And just a few hours after
announcing their engagement,
Brad and Janet
had both tasted...
FRANK'S COCK!
I'm sure it would rattle
in your mouth, dear.
...forbidden fruit.
This in itself was proof that
their host was a man of little morals
and some persuasion.
What further indignities were
they to be subjected to?
And what of
the sonic transducer?
And the floor show
that had been spoken of?
What indeed?
From what had gone before,
it was clear that this was
to be...
A PICNIC?
I forgot my thermals.
...no picnic.
IT WAS GREAT WHEN IT ALL BEGAN
I WAS A REGULAR FRANKIE FAN
BUT IT WAS OVER
WHEN HE HAD THE PLAN
TO START WORKING ON
A MUSCLE MAN
NOW THE ONLY THING
THAT GIVES ME HOPE
IS MY LOVE OF A CERTAIN DOPE
ROSE TINT MY WORLD
KEEP ME SAFE
FROM MY TROUBLE AND PAIN
I AM JUST SEVEN HOURS OLD
TRULY BEAUTIFUL TO BEHOLD
AND SOMEBODY SHOULD BE TOLD
MY LIBIDO
HASN'T BEEN CONTROLLED
NOW THE ONLY THING
I'VE COME TO TRUST
IS AN ORGASMIC RUSH OF LUST
ROSE TINT MY WORLD
KEEP ME SAFE FROM MY TROUBLE AND PAIN
IT'S BEYOND ME
ME, MOMMY
I'LL BE GOOD -- YOU'LL SEE
TAKE THIS DREAM AWAY
WHAT'S THIS?
LET'S SEE
I FEEL SEXY
WHAT'S COME OVER ME?
HERE IT COMES AGAIN
OH, I FEEL RELEASED
BAD TIMES DECEASED
MY CONFIDENCE HAS INCREASED
REALITY IS HERE
THE GAME HAS BEEN DISBANDED
MY MIND HAS BEEN EXPANDED
IT'S A GAS THAT FRANKIE'S LANDED!
HIS LUST IS SO SINCERE
AHH
AHH, AH-AH AHH,
AH-AH AHH
OHHHH
AHHH
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO FAY WRAY?
THAT DELICATE
SATIN-DRAPED FRAME?
AS IT CLUNG TO HER THIGH
HOW I STARTED TO CRY
'CAUSE I WANTED TO BE DRESSED
JUST THE SAME
GIVE YOURSELF OVER
TO ABSOLUTE PLEASURE
SWIM THE WARM WATERS
OF SINS OF THE FLESH
EROTIC NIGHTMARES
BEYOND ANY MEASURE
AND SENSUAL DAYDREAMS
TO TREASURE FOREVER
CAN'T YOU JUST SEE IT?
WHOA-HO-HO!

DON'T DREAM IT

DON'T DREAM IT

DON'T DREAM IT

We've got to get
out of this trap,
before this decadence
saps our wills!
I've got to be strong,
and try to hang on,
or my mind may well snap!
and my life will be lived...
FOR THE THRILLS!
DON'T DREAM IT
BE IT
IT'S BEYOND ME
HELP ME, MOMMY
GOD BLESS LILI SAINT CYR

YOUR MISSION IS A FAILURE
YOUR LIFESTYLE'S TOO EXTREME
I'M YOUR NEW COMMANDER
YOU NOW ARE MY PRISONER
WE RETURN TO TRANSYLVANIA
PREPARE THE TRANSIT BEAM
Wait!
I can explain.
ON THE DAY I WENT AWAY
GOODBYE

OH, MY, MY

I MA-A-AY
'CAUSE I'VE SEEN BLUE SKIES

OH
'CAUSE I'VE SEEN BLUE SKIES
THROUGH THE TEARS
IN MY EYES
AND I REALIZE
I'M GOING HOME
I'M GOING HOME
I'M GOING HOME
I'M GOING
HOME
How sentimental.
and also presumptuous of you.
You see, when I said "we"
were to return,
I referred only to Magenta
and myself.
I'm sorry, however, if you
found my words misleading,
you see,
you are to remain here...
in spirit, anyway.
Good God, that's a laser!
Yes, Dr. Scott.
A laser capable of emitting
a beam of pure antimatter.
: Wha-- you mean you're
going to kill him?
You saw what became of Eddie.
Society must be protected.
Exactly, Dr. Scott.
Now, Frank-N-Furter,
your time has come.
Say goodbye to all this...
and hello to oblivion!
Do your worst.
Do your worst, inferior one!
No! No!
Aah!
No!
No...
No...
Yes.
Get away from me!
Aah ha ha ha ha!
Help me!
Somebody!
Help me!
I thought you liked them.
They liked you.
They didn't like me.
They never liked me!
You saw the way things were,
the way they were going.
You did right.
You should leave now, Dr. Scott,
while it's still possible.
We're about to beam
the entire house
back to the planet of Transsexual
in the galaxy of Transylvania.
Go now.
Our noble mission
is almost complete,
my most beautiful sister.
And soon we shall return
to the moon-drenched shores
of our beloved planet.
Ahh, sweet Transsexual,
land of night.
To sing and dance once more
to your dark refrain.
Activate the transit crystal.
AHH, AHH, AHH, AHH
AHH, AHH
AHH, AHH, AHH, AHH
