I'm known as rich King Midas
And when you look at me
You'll see a king who knows a thing
About his treasury
I never care for women
I never care for wine
But when I count a large amount of money
It's divine
My love for shiny gold is such
That I could never have too much
Who art thou, stranger?
A friend. Just call me Goldie.
What do you want? My gold?
I want thy paltry gold?
Tis but chicken feed to me.
Behold.
The golden touch.
My gold, my kingdom,
everything for the golden touch.
Keep thy shirt on, oh, king.
To you, the golden touch
would prove a golden curse.
A curse? A curse?
Then curse me with the golden touch.
But gold is the snare of the soul.
Gold is the root of all evil. Gold is the...
Fiddlesticks. Give me gold, not advice.
So be it.
I gave thee advice, now I give thee gold.
The golden touch is thine.
Toodle-loo.
The golden touch is mine.
Kitty, kitty, kitty.
Nice kitty.
Come here, kitty, kitty.
Come to papa.
Come here!
It works, it works.
The golden touch, the golden touch
The golden touch, the golden touch
Hail, Midas.
Thou rascal, thou.
Shall we turn the earth to gold?
The rivers, the mountains,
the stars, the moon, the sky.
A universe of gold.
Gold for the soul,
but food for the stomach.
Gold.
Gold.
Gold.
Is the richest king in all the world
to starve to death?
No, no, no!
Goldie! Goldie! Goldie!
Is this the great man who bellowed,
"Give me gold, not advice"?
Goldie, Goldie. Help me, Goldie.
Take away this golden curse.
Don't let me starve. Take everything.
My gold, my kingdom
for a hamburger sandwich.
With or without onions?
Hamburger, just plain old hamburger.
Now thou art a wise and humble king.
I will take back the golden touch
in exchange for everything you possess.
Toodle-loo.
No, no, no, Goldie. Spare me these.
With onions.
