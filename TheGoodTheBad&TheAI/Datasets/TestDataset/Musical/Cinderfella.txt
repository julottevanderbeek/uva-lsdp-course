"And being of sound mind
"and in full possession
of my faculties,
"and in the presence
of the undersigned witnesses,
"I write my last will and testament.
"I leave my estate
and all my worldly goods
"to my dear wife, Emily...
"...in the knowledge
that she will take loving care
"of my son, Fella."
Fella!
Fella!
-
- Yes!
I am now, Mother.
- What?
- I mean, Stepmother.
That's better. Now, get to work.
Bring my breakfast. Fried eggs.
Basted.
Boys.
Rupert, dear.
Maximilian, love.
Boys, wake up.
Come, come. Wake up.
- Good morning, Mother dear.
- Good morning, sweets.
- Good morning, Rupert.
- Good morning, Mother dearest.
Come, son,
it's time for your breakfast.
I heard some strange noises.
Did you children hear anything?
No, Mother, not a thing.
I went to bed early,
was sleeping very soundly.
Mother's good boys.
Come on, then.
It must have been that fool
in the kitchen.
If he's broken any more dishes,
I'll take away his bicycle privileges.
Paper. A paper.
Paper! All right.
-
- All right!
How dizzy.
Fella!
Fella! Fella!
-
- Yeah? Oh!
Yes, Stepmother.
- Where's my car?
- Oh, I'll...
I'll drive it right around
to the front door.
Don't dirty my upholstery
with your filthy clothes.
I'll be careful not to dirty
your nice upholstery
with my dirty, filthy clothes,
Stepmother.
Didn't I tell you to be here
at half past 12?
Sorry, Mother... Stepmother,
I thought you said 12.30.
- Can't you ever do anything I ask you?
- Well, I try, Stepmother, I really try.
You don't seem to realise
that you haven't got a cent.
Your father left everything to me.
Yet I give you a home, room and board
out of goodness.
Yes, I know you do, Stepmother.
Well...
You ought to be more reasonable.
But one can't expect anything
from somebody with ordinary blood
in their veins.
Well, I realise
I don't have the class
that Maximilian and Rupert have,
but I certainly appreciate
everything that you do for me.
Then show your appreciation
by getting some work done.
Yes, Stepmother.
We've an important house guest,
and I want everything to be perfect.
- You understand? Perfect.
- Yes, perfect. It will be perfect. Yes.
- Who is it, Stepmother?
- You'll read all about it in the papers.
Then it must be someone
very important. Who?
- And clean the pool!
- Yes, I will, with a rag.
Enjoy your ride.
I fixed the car perfectly, mechanically,
beautifully, so that you'd enjoy driving.
Perfectly, it's mechanically perfect.
It's perfectly... It's...
It's at least good enough
to get you into town.
Hello, there, Fella.
Hello. How did you know my...?
Hello. How did you know
my name was Fella?
- It had to be Fella.
- You're a friend of Mother's?
Your stepmother, you mean.
No, I wouldn't say we were friends.
Or will we ever be.
Well, she invited you to go swimming.
That was rather friendly.
No, I'm afraid I invited myself.
But I'll leave if I bother you,
you know.
You don't bother me. On the contrary.
I like to see people enjoy themselves.
Oh, well, thank you.
I like you, Fella.
- We're gonna get along.
- Well, thank you. I like to get along.
I love persons and people.
Persons and people.
There's a difference?
Oh, sure, there's a big difference.
You see, persons are people who've
made it, who are rich and famous.
So that makes them persons
and they're not people any more.
I see, yes.
But, but I...
I like persons because I feel sorry
for them, you know?
Fella, you've got me worried,
you know.
Some day, you might be
a very important person.
Me?
Uh-huh.
Yeah?
Let me be a people
I don't ask for much
Just a space
A happy place
That has the common touch.
I'm aware I'll never be great
A head of state? A potentate?
Oh, no.
I don't care for elegant clothes
For goodness knows
My life is rosy
Let me be a people
I'm no VIP
Though you'll never go bragging
about your family tree.
I don't wanna be anyone else
But plain old me
Apple pie and the Fourth of July
Can really pleasure you high.
Simple things like community sings
Can bring a tear to your eye.
Rock 'n' roll or an afternoon stroll
Is all the funning you need.
Orangeade and a circus parade
And you'll be hitting your speed.
Oh, my.
I keep stating it
No debating it
I'm a happy breed
So therefore
Let me be a people
Says I sincerely
You're a fella who wouldn't care
for royalty?
I don't wanna be anyone else
But plain
Old
Me
- Just plain. I don't really...
- Well, it's like I said, Fella.
Some day, maybe you'll be a person.
Why do you keep saying that?
Well, all I can say is that
you and I are going to have a ball.
A great, big, wonderful ball.
You've done it, Mother.
It'll be the affair of the season.
Thank you, Rupert.
It always warms a mother's heart
when her sons are proud of her.
It'll cost a fortune.
And you're always screaming at me
about my spending.
It will be expensive.
And as for my screaming,
I never raise my voice...
...except to that lunatic
we have to put up with.
- The lunatic?
-
Another drink, Mother?
Did you complete
all your chores today?
Oh, yes, I did, Mother...
Stepmother dear.
Everything except...
Excuse me, Maximilian.
Except pruning the water lilies.
And feeding the goldfish.
But I can do that after dinner.
- Why didn't you finish your chores?
- Why?
Well, a very odd thing happened.
Excuse me... Oh, there's a cold glass.
The ice is cold. Excuse me, please.
A very odd thing happened, Mother.
There, Rupert.
There was a strange man in our pool.
In my pool.
Oh, yes, dear Stepmother.
In your pool.
And we were just talking, and
all of a sudden, he just disappeared.
- What do you mean, "disappeared"?
- Just like I say, Mother... Stepmother.
We were there talking
and he was just gone.
Pshtwaa...
And there he wasn't, and...
- Pshtwaa...
- Pshtwaa...
How do we make
Corkhead here disappear?
If the princess sees him, she'll think
there's insanity in the family.
But this is true. I'm not making it up.
I was standing there talking to him.
In fact, he told me
all about the ball we're having.
And he said it to me
before the paper even came out.
You're cracking, kid.
Just like those dreams you have
about your old man.
Is that so, Mr Smart Alec?
Well, those dreams are true.
Fella's father's always telling him
that he's rich.
- Isn't he, Fella?
- Yes, Stepmother dear.
Yes. Except that I always
wake up too soon.
I don't think you ever woke up.
You're a spook. Beat it!
Yeah, but all I...
OK. I'll set the table for dinner.
Mother dear, this door...
...is open.
And I'll leave while I can.
Now... about the fortune I'm spending.
Those dreams he has are true.
His father's ghost is trying to tell him
where he hid his fortune.
He'll be rich if he finds the money.
And we'll be paupers.
So it's important
for Rupert to marry the princess.
I see how important it is.
I haven't the confidence
in Rupert's charm
for the opposite sex
that you have, Mother.
I think we should ensure our chances
by starting to be nice...
...to the Little Fella.
Of course.
Be nice to the Little Fella.
Supper's ready.
Dinner's on.
We're gonna eat now.
It's gonna be...
Food.
Come on, we'll...
I'm hungry.
Fella...
Yes, dear Stepmother?
- You may serve the wine now, Fella.
- The wine.
Will there be anything else,
Stepmother?
That's all, thank you.
Fella...
- Yes, Mother dear?
- Bring the sugar, please.
Yes, Stepmother.
In my coffee, Fella, please.
- Anything else?
- That's all. Thank you, Fella.
You're welcome.
Fella...
Ohh...!
Yes, Maximilian?
Light me.
Yeah, all right.
Maybe I should light it for you,
Maximilian.
Oh, there's a painful lip.
Could you pull on the lip, Max?
Just easy.
The hurting lip. Just...
ARGHH!
It's a hole.
There's a hole in my lip and it burns.
I'm tired and running
with a hole in my lip.
I can't eat my soup
with a hole in the lip.
I forgot to change.
Shall we retire?
Fella, we'll have our brandy
in the library.
The brandy in the lib... Yes.
And, Fella...
the prime rib was delicious.
The prime... You loved it?
Prime rib?
You loved the prime rib?
My ribs... was good?
I'm gonna faint.
Did you really love the prime rib?
Did you...? Did you...?
Was it...?
Did you like it a lot?
Or just a little lot?
Oh, I'm...
Oh, I worked very...
To my bones, fingers.
I'm glad you liked my meat prime.
I... Oh, thank you, oh, Mother,
for enjoying my prime meat of ribs.
I'm so grateful to you all.
- Fella.
- Yes?
Tomorrow, I may take you
to play polo with me.
Polo?
Me, polo?
The gentleman's game.
Oh, thank you, Maxie.
And maybe you'd like to play
tennis and golf with us.
Oh, what wonderful brothers.
Two swell persons to have as my own,
my brothers own.
And Mother and brothers and all.
Fella, the brandy, please.
Oh, yes, Mother.
I'll... Excuse me.
To love the prime meat ribs.
It's a wonder... I'm so glad that you...
I'll hope to always have more of this.
Aren't you going too far, playing tennis
with him? And golf? And polo?
I'll make him so tired
he won't be able to wake up.
Then he'll finish his dream.
They loved the prime ribs.
Oh, Father was so right.
"Love, and thee shall be
loved in return."
Just like on the ring.
How wise Father was.
"To Fella:
"Love thy neighbour.
"Love him hard and well.
"The love that you give will be
returned and manifested in itself
"to give back the warmth
and the care and the affection,
"as well as the hugs and the loves
of those who have loved.
"To live and not to love
could be affectionate,
"but yet warmth would still
maintain itself
"in the love that you give to them.
"Others have loved in the past and yet
have found that they couldn't be hate.
"So with love it is
the beneficial part of giving.
"Many children have loved and yet
found they couldn't know anyone
"with kissing and wisdom,
with hugging..."
Everybody
Needs to care
For somebody
All your dreams were meant
To share
With somebody
Someone to have
A midnight cup of tea with
To have and hold
And sometimes disagree with
Oh, it's wonderful
To live for somebody
And the most you have to give is
Your love
In a cabin or a castle
Even though you rise or fall
Without somebody
You're nobody
At all
Where's our pigeon?
He's getting dressed
in one of my outfits. "Our" pigeon?
Max, I think your idea will work.
He'll never wake up
after the exercise I give him.
I hope you make out as well
with the princess.
I'll try. I'm brushing up
at Arthur Murray's.
Is that polo? That's the gentle...
It's not a very gentle gentleman.
I thought it was that game where
you hit the ball through that steel
and it just goes.
But that's a... a high horse.
I don't wanna be no gentle... game.
I don't need that.
I don't want it. No!
I thought it was another game!
No, I... Well, hold it. All right, hold it!
I'll walk. I'll walk.
I... l'm not as scared and I'm not
a coward, if that's the game.
I'm a coward and they're high-tall.
You better drag because I'll never...
I'm frightened.
Has he come out again?
Come out?
He could hardly drag himself in.
Listen...
...if we find out where the money is,
we don't tell the old lady.
We keep it to ourselves, huh?
Right.
-
- Ah!
Oh, hello, Father.
Where have you been?
Daddy. Pop.
You look very warm.
Your whole head is all perspired.
Where were you?
Oh, yes, it is very hot
down there, isn't it?
I'm glad to see you again,
Father, Papa, Dad.
What?
Me? I am?
Rich?
With millions? You mean,
I'll be a wealthy millionaire?
A rich wealthy.
A wealthy rich millions.
Millions, and I have
millions and millions?
That's rich to be.
Millions and millions rich is good.
And with all of that money,
then I can buy
my lovely precious stepmother
a warm sweater with sequins on it.
What? You want to show me
where the money is hidden?
You want me to go with you to see?
Oh, all right.
I want to see where all of that
millions of rich dollars are.
I'll go with you, Father, because I want
to see all... all the wealthy money.
That's rich dollars.
To have millions of... What?
You want me to go...?
Oh, out the window.
Oh, is that...? Is that where
all the moneys are, Father?
Oh. Well, then,
I'll just go and look.
Oh, all right, I will close...
- Argh!
-
What, Daddy?
Two?
Oh, all right.
This is Del Moore
with the NBC mobile unit
in exclusive Bel Air, Los Angeles,
in front of the famous Kingston estate,
awaiting the arrival
of Princess Charming of Morovia.
The princess, as you know from
the newsreels and newspaper photos,
is one of the most beautiful
European royals.
She will be in our city as the guest
of Mrs Roland Kingston,
whose great-grandfather,
the Duke Vladimir,
was related to the Archduke Maximilian
Rupert Lupin of Morovia.
She'll be here for a week
before starting her tour in the US.
Here she comes, with entourage,
from the airport with the escort.
For the ladies watching, she's wearing
the national colour of periwinkle blue.
A blue-grey periwinkle, actually,
the national colour...
Wowie.
Is she beautiful!
Indeed she is, my boy.
Hello, Fella.
Hello, mister.
Did you see the Princess Charming?
Yes. And as you said,
she's beautiful.
Yeah, huh?
Gee, I'd like to see her up close.
But I can't.
They got me locked in here.
They don't want her to know
I'm in the family.
- Oh, you'll see her.
- No, not a chance.
They hired a whole staff of help
to do the work that I do.
And they locked me in this...
They locked...
How did you get in here?
I'm a people. I can get in anywhere.
Really? Like magic,
you just pop on and pop off?
Just like an electric light bulb.
I was talking to Thomas Edison
about that.
Really?
Thomas Edison? Oh.
Well, I'm very glad to see you,
although I don't know who you are.
Oh, yeah. You're with the FBI,
and you're incognito.
You're here to protect the princess.
- No.
- No?
I can't lie to you, Fella.
I'm not from the FBI.
I am your godfather.
Your fairy godfather.
Godfather?
Fairy godfather?
Like in a fairy tale?
No, you're from the FBI.
Are you guys playing games
or something?
This is no game, Fella.
I am exactly like
Cinderella's fairy godmother.
As a matter of fact,
I personally handled Cindy's case.
You handled her case.
Why don't you sit down?
- I think you'll feel much better.
- Perhaps you better sit down.
I... I should?
You mean, you would rather
have me sit down?
I hope this doesn't sound
like braggadocio,
because really I'm a very modest
fairy godfather.
Oh.
But it wasn't a godmother
that Cinderella had.
No?
It was me.
It was you.
- It was me.
- Yes.
You see, the women reporters
of that period wrote the story.
So naturally, they attributed
my magic to a woman.
Women are strange, Fella.
They're like the Russians.
They want credit
for inventing everything.
Well, I... l... I like you.
I like you very much.
And... Except that, I just... well...
I don't believe in fairy tales, you see.
Like Cinderella and...
I just don't believe in them.
Oh, well, you have just voiced
a perfectly normal reaction.
But you have to believe,
or we won't be able to work together.
Well, I... Work together?
Godfather, Cinderella.
What are you trying to say?
Hate to be corny, boy,
but you force me.
Cindy!
Cindy!
Good day to you, Godfather.
- Now do you believe me?
- No. It's a trick.
Like on TV. With those magicians
that saw the women in half.
Oh, no, no, she's real.
- You can touch her.
- She's real? Touch her?
I could walk right through her.
This is a trick. She's a mirage.
I've seen...
If I weren't a married woman...
-
-
Oh, she's real. Yeah, I mean...
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're married to the Prince Charming.
Mrs Charming, I'm glad to...
Cinderella, Mrs Charming. I mean...
- Oh, oh, oh...
- You believe now, eh, Fella?
No! I know the story of Cinderella.
She didn't wear shoes,
she wore glass slippers.
Oh, you're right.
But that was with her ball gown.
Real glass?
Unbreakable, sire.
Early laminated windshield glass.
I'd better go now, Godfather.
The Prince is waiting.
It was so nice to see you again.
So nice to see you again, Godfather.
Delighted to have met you, sire.
Oh, also very good to meet up you.
And you'll love living in a castle.
Castles are so roomy.
So much more comfortable
than tract houses.
Yeah, that's true,
some houses are not the same as...
Miss Person? Lady?
Goodbye, Cinderella.
I mean, Mrs Charming.
Goodbye.
Me, in a castle? What did she mean,
I would live in a castle?
Fella, you do believe that
I'm your fairy godfather?
Yes, sire. Yes, sir, I do.
- Then you'll believe what I tell you?
- Yes, without a doubt.
Good.
Fella, you have been chosen
to rectify all the great wrongs
brought about by the original
Cinderella story.
Through the centuries, women,
influenced by Cinderella, have waited
for their Prince Charmings
to come galloping
out of the wild blue yonder
on white horses
to claim their hands in marriage.
Yeah, I... I read that once.
But there was only
one Prince Charming.
When he didn't appear, these women
married the closest available man.
They were forever after miserable,
because they always regretted it,
and they felt that...
...that they had taken second best.
But what is worse, they made
their poor husbands miserable
because the poor fellow
wasn't a prince.
Oh, the Cinderella legend
has brought nothing but dissatisfaction
to the hearts of women,
and their husbands
have taken the brunt of it.
- It's not fair.
- I won't bother you with statistics.
But the unhappy husbands
of the world are crying for help.
They're crying for a chance
to get even.
It's time for a change.
And you have been chosen
to bring out that change.
Change? Out? Chosen me?
I'm...? Who chosen?
You've been chosen
by the head man.
- The head man?
- The head man.
The chairman of the board
of directors of all fairy godfathers.
And the Society for the Prevention
of Distorting the Truth in Fairy Tales,
and the Committee
for Sanity of Married Men.
Chairman of the board?
You had a meeting?
A meeting?
Why, we argued like a summit.
- There were some against you.
- What did I do to them?
They thought the one chosen should
be tall, handsome and clever.
But I fought for you.
I said you were perfect for the task,
because you're ordinary.
You're not tall or handsome,
and you're anything but clever.
Thank you, Godfather,
for taking my part.
That's all right.
- I appreciate it.
- Would you?
No, thank you.
The filters make me cough.
So you are the one
who is going to settle the score
for all the downtrodden married men,
and when we finish,
married men will be able to look
their wives in the face -
that is, if they have their make-up on -
and put them in their place.
I can hear the husbands saying,
"Why wasn't I lucky like Fella?
"He's not handsome,
he's not tall, he's not clever,
"but he ended up married to
a beautiful princess, instead of you."
The men will be able to get even
for centuries of female abuse.
But best of all, the best part of it is
men and women will learn to be
happy with each other as they are.
I get it now. Ordinary people
will accept one another.
Ordinary people will be
satisfied with one another.
Yeah. Sure. They won't be looking
around for something better.
Now you've got the idea.
That's the idea.
Yeah. "Boy, that Fella was lucky.
"He was an ordinary guy.
"He wasn't tall or handsome.
He wasn't even clever.
"And yet, he ended up
marrying a beautiful princess."
That'll teach those nagging wives,
won't it, Father Fairygod... sir?
It sure will, Fella. It sure will.
Fella!
Jack and Jill!
Fetch a pail of water.
Now, go on, quickly. Quickly.
He must marry the princess.
Oh, thank you so much, children.
Thank you.
You said you wanted to see her
closer? Well, there she is.
Sorry. Yeah, but...
Couldn't I see her even closer?
After all, if she's gonna be my wife...
Hey, isn't he holding the future wife
just a little too close?
Oh, stop worrying.
She's all yours, every bit of her.
Yeah, but I'd like to have
the bits he's holding.
Wait and watch.
I'll be back as soon as
I fix my magic schedule.
OK.
But shouldn't I...?
What would happen if...?
Still hugging her too close.
She's gonna...
Stop hugging.
He's moving in. We'll be rich!
Maybe if I bite him. No.
It's Mother screaming.
- What happened?
- A terrible man.
He just ran away.
And remember,
keep dancing with Her Highness.
Never let her out of your arms.
Mother, she'll have the same royal
treatment I gave the downstairs maid.
That's my son.
- And what was that?
- You all look very lovely this evening.
What in the world are you wearing?
Oh, I got this out of the cellar.
This was my father's.
He wore this the day he married you.
I was just going upstairs
to tuck it in here and there.
You'll still look like a fugitive
from Hallowe'en.
It'll be all right. I'll cut one sleeve
on the bias here, but it'll be fine.
Then where do you think you're going?
To the ball.
Is that so, smart alecs?
Well, I was invited to the ball.
I sent out the invitations.
You certainly weren't on the list.
No, you didn't invite me, Stepmother.
He invited me.
- He? Who's he?
- Well, my...
Well, I was just invited.
Maybe you dreamed
your old man invited you?
Maybe your father wanted you
to give that suit an airing.
Why not wear one of your mother's
old dresses, and I'll dance with you?
- Don't talk about my mother.
- Take that silly suit back to the cellar.
And while you're there,
fire the furnace.
A small group is coming here
after the ball.
- Come, boys. We'll be late.
- But I was invited.
- You're dreaming again.
- You're cracking up, creep.
Well, Maximilian, Mother knew
what she was doing,
spending the rest of our money
on this little investment.
I'm still banking on Fella's dream.
If this continues,
we won't need Fella's dream.
Let me be a person
A social VIP
I'm all through with going around
As plain old me
I'll see red till my blood turns blue
Look out
This Fella is finally coming out
I heard everything you said.
Everything. I'm surprised.
No, I'm not surprised.
I'm appalled by your lack of faith.
Well, you see...
Let me explain. You see.
- The... the... l... l...
- Oh, I see.
That's why I changed this attire.
If you can no longer believe
in your fairy godfather,
maybe it'll be easier for you
to believe in the fairy godmother.
I'm up on all this Oedipus nonsense,
you know.
I'm awfully sorry, Fairy Godmother.
Godfath... Godfath...
Well, I... I hope you forgive me.
- I believe you.
- Good.
That'll give me a chance
to get rid of this silly outfit.
I borrowed this from
a Hallowe'en witch I used to date.
It's getting late.
We've got lots to do.
Excuse me.
Our dance, Your Highness?
With whom shall I be dancing?
With one who is truly...
...fond of you,
and who worships you very much.
Maximilian, it doesn't seem possible,
but... that is Corkhead.
Don't be silly, Mother.
That's a much older man.
Is it true, Princess, that you came here
to find a husband?
Let's talk about you.
Haven't we met before?
We? You and I? Met before?
Oh, I doubt it.
I... I don't think so.
Yes, we have.
Well, I can't lie to you, Princess.
We have met before, but...
Well, I'm not a duke or a duchy.
I mean, any of those things like that.
As a matter of fact, I'm a phoney.
Even the clothes I'm wearing
aren't mine.
I didn't even work
to get this grey hair.
And, well, I don't like a phoney...
...and I don't think
you should be stuck with one.
I don't understand,
but I'm sure we'll get along.
- Well, I... I think that...
-
I think I'll have to get along.
That's my cue.
What do you mean, your cue?
What I'm trying to say is
the fish will turn into the car,
the car that was the chauffeur's,
the fish that was my bike.
- What?
- I can't explain.
But thank you for the dance.
I'll never forget it. I'll never forget you.
Come back.
Oh, please come back.
Without somebody
You're nobody at all
Get home before midnight,
or my car turns into a bike
and you'll be a fish out of water.
You won't be able to breathe,
and I'll have a fishy bike.
The change has started.
Wait a minute.
Watch it. Don't waste the water.
You need all you can get.
It's happening! Here, fish. Rest.
Don't worry.
Whatever the transportation,
as long as you drink.
Keep breathing.
Keep breathing, fish.
That's it. Breathe deep.
Where's your...?
- Your little red jacket?
- What red jacket?
You know which one I mean.
Where's the little red coat?
- What?
- If you have red coat,
it means that you have
a little bit of money.
- Money?
- Millions.
What money?
Come on. Let's have a little money.
Max, all you ever talk about is...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm gonna give you three seconds
to tell me where the money is,
before I bop you on your bopper.
Max, that's real important
to you, money?
That's all you really care about.
Well, I know where the money is.
I always knew where the money is.
If you really want the money,
you're gonna get it, Maxie.
You don't have to leave the house.
You can stay now.
You can afford it.
But the money is yours.
Your father left it for you.
Yes, but you've always loved money.
Your boys have always loved money.
And you've put up with me
all these years hoping to get it.
Well, here it is.
I hope you'll all be very happy.
And now you don't have
to put up with me any longer.
Fella.
I'm sorry.
Leave that alone. It's Fella's.
Hello, Fella.
Hello...
How'd you know my name?
Have we met before?
I think so.
But that's not important
at the moment.
You see, I'm working
my way through college.
I'm selling shoes.
I have a sample right here.
Would you be interested
in a shoe like this?
Please try it on.
I'm sure it would fit you perfectly.
No. I think that would be
just a little too big for me.
Well, good luck.
I have to be getting along.
Fella...
...I love you.
You can't love me.
But I do. Please listen to me.
It's no good.
You're a person and I'm a people.
- I'm a girl.
- You're a princess.
Well, isn't a princess a girl?
Well, then I'm...
I'm just an ordinary fella.
Well, I'm just an ordinary
girl princess.
- You certainly don't look ordinary.
- But I can.
It's just like you said, Fella.
Don't let the clothes fool you.
Oh, it's more than that.
- It's no good.
- No, Fella.
Like you said, it's just the clothes.
It's no good. I'm a people
and you're a person.
It just won't mix, that's all.
Fella, please listen to me. Fella.
Fella, please look at me. Please.
Just, please.
Come back, Fella. I love you.
Someone to have
A midnight cup of tea with
To have and hold
Sometimes
Disagree with
Oh, it's wonderful to live
For somebody
And the most you have to give
Is your love
