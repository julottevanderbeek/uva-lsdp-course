A restored version of
THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORT
FRIDAY MORNING
Set up here?
That´s all for today, children.
Good-bye, ma´am.
And don´t forget your costumes
tomorrow.
Delphine, come look. They´re here!
They´re setting up on the square.
The girls won´t be ready.
We´ll rehearse Sunday.
- No need to.
- Think so?
Quarter to 12! I´m late!
Delphine! Pick up Booboo?
- Can´t you?
- I´ll go at 4.
I can´t wear this!
Sure, I can... No, I can´t.
Guillaume will be waiting.
- What´s he want?
- To see me.
Let him wait.
Home for lunch?
Yes, but not before 1.
Where´s my compact?
Here it is...
See you later.
- Where you off to?
- The café.
Wait for us.
Fries?
Two orders of fries.
- Fair time?
- We just arrived.
- It´ll boost business.
- No need to.
- We´re going for a walk.
- Not now!
We´re not on call.
What slackers!
How you treat your ladies!
They aren´t our ladies...
not really.
Performers?
The blonde does an Indian shimmy,
the redhead a Chinese shimmy.
- It´s harder.
- How interesting...
He´s the boss.
I second him. I´m a mechanic.
- Hello, Yvonne.
- Hello, Maxence.
Hello, Josette. Hello, Gramps.
- Still abstract?
- More than ever.
He was born that way.
In 3 days I´m demobbed.
- A Pimm´s.
- We´re out.
- Aren´t we?
- But he can order something else.
A beer.
- So, did you find her?
- Not yet, but I can wait.
A beer for Maxence.
- Did he find her?
- Not yet.
- What´d he lose?
- His feminine ideal.
He never found her to begin with!
He painted her. He´s a painter-poet.
He´s stationed here.
We all seek our feminine ideal.
He´s not the only one.
Don´t be so sad, Maxence.
Girls are a dime a dozen.
Nice portrait,
but no one like that here.
- No, no one.
- I prefer redheads.
- Heavens! Have you seen Delphine?
- No, ma´am.
I bet she forgot to pick up Booboo.
Could you go, Maxence?
I´m already late for maneuvers.
I have to set the tables.
- I´m sorry.
- Never mind.
´Bye, Gramps.
Could you two gentlemen go?
The school´s around the corner.
Sure, we don´t mind.
You´re sweet. Just ask for Booboo.
- Who?
- Booboo... He´s my son, my youngest.
I´m afraid I can never go out.
I´m confined to this aquarium.
Me, who was meant to live in
the open air on the Pacific shore,
listening to sweet music
and reading poetry.
Yvonne, I´m out of glue.
Could you buy some glue
on the way? Thanks.
Hi, Delphe!
You´re filthy!
Look at you! And in your new pants!
- Are you Booboo?
- Why do you ask?
We came to fetch Booboo.
- Says who?
- The lady in the café.
- What nerve!
- We´re straight.
We came with the fair.
I bet you did!
- You´re quite pretty.
- So I´ve been told!
- You´ll split your dress.
- Quiet!
So, do we take the kid?
- I wanna go with them.
- You kidnappers?
- We wouldn´t say if we were.
- Smart aleck!
Actually, it suits me because...
Never mind!
Behave yourself. Bye, pumpkin.
- Your aunt´s swell!
- She´s my sister!
She´s a honey!
I want some candy.
We gonna stand here all day?
Hello, dear rose.
- You´re lovely, dear soul.
- By "soul" you mean my body.
You´re so right, dear heart.
If I weren´t so in love with you,
I´d be jealous.
But I love you
and that fills me with pride...
And craving, since I want you.
I inspire your baser feellings.
And gluttony and lust.
And prattle.
You love to hear yourself talk.
Myself and yourself. I love you.
That why you wanted to see me?
You don´t love me,
but you´ll marry me.
I already said no, Guillaume.
- So why do you come?
- You´re so entertaining.
But if you prefer, I´ll stop coming.
Why, that´s me!
Yes, dear rose.
Since when do you pose for soldiers?
Soldiers? What´s this nonsense?
- Who painted it?
- I said, a soldier.
Calls himself a painter and poet.
Get the picture? Know him?
An uncanny likeness,
don´t you think?
Mere coincidence.
- But it´s me all over!
- No, it´s just figurative.
You´re spiritual, dear soul.
It´s a worthless picture,
pure fantasy.
He modestly calls it
"Feminine Ideal".
He must really love me to dream me
up like this. What´s he like?
Dull, insignificant.
I want to meet him.
Sorry. He just left for Paris.
But he´s not your type at all.
Farewell, Guillaume.
Good-bye, dear heart.
Your eyes are the same blue
as the picture.
- I can´t help it.
- Aren´t they?
You like blue eyes,
so you can tell.
I´ve never seen anything like them.
How odd! It can´t be abstract
if it resembIes his eyes...
Which aren´t abstract,
so this picture sees you as I do.
Look, Mom!
- You shouldn´t have!
- It´s nothing.
Thanks.
- Here you go, Gramps.
- How kind of you.
- Will you have a drink?
- Why not?
We met a knockout blonde!
- Your sister.
- I don´t have a sister.
- He means Delphe.
- Delphine... my daughter.
- She´s a peach!
- So are you!
So I´ve been told.
S.O.S.! Storm at sea!
Be quiet, Booboo.
Hello, Dutrouz!
Hello, everyone.
They´re friends.
Subtil Dutrouz.
"Subtil" like a scent,
Dutrouz with a silent "z".
- Bill as in billiards.
- Etienne like everyone else.
- Here, for you.
- What is it?
A plastic atomic submarine.
- How´s it holding?
- Fine.
That´s good.
I just saw them tramping by,
armed to the teeth.
They´d shoot us like rabbits.
- What´ll you have?
- Nothing, I´m off.
I´ll be back later.
- Who´s that?
- A friend of Gramps´.
- What´s he do?
- Retired.
- What exactly do you do?
- Us?
- What´s wrong?
- I´m sad and bored.
You´re hiding something.
It´s over with GuiIIaume.
That´s good news!
I never Iiked the guy.
Know what I´m thinking?
Yes, about your dream man.
How´d you guess?
It´s easy, darIing...
You have that ´´dream man´´ Iook
on your face.
o
Sweetie, guys Iike that
don´t hang out in Rochefort.
Not right now.
He´s in Paris. He did my portrait.
Who is it? You never mentioned him.
A painter. I don´t know him.
He exists and he Ioves me.
But I´ve never seen him.
- You´re iII!
- I´m serious.
- To Paris, then!
- And our pupiIs?
- Our careers first!
- Without money?
Never mind, for now we´re free!
We Ieave for Paris next week.
This afternoon
I´II go see Mr Dame...
What´s so funny?
Nothing. It´s such a siIIy name.
He´s very nice.
He knows Andrew MiIIer.
- Who´s that?
- Dunno...
An American composer.
They went to schooI together.
Andrew MiIIer is giving
some recitaIs in Paris
and Simon Dame
wiII teII him about me.
In a Ietter...
Then I´II get Booboo.
No need to.
Mom sent two guys this morning.
I went for nothing.
Booboo Ieft with them.
You Iet Booboo go off
with two strangers?
The town´s crawIing
with soIdiers, sadists and painters!
You´II never get a man, oId girI.
You were born 12 min. Iater!
Don´t ´´oId girI´´ me! As for men...
- That´s it!
- What?
I´ve got the theme for my concerto!
Good day, sisters.
Schubert´s ´´Ave Maria.´´
Here we are.
- Is that aII?
- Yes, thank you.
Good-bye, Mr Dame.
- HeIIo, Mr Dame.
- HeIIo, miss.
Your music paper arrived.
I´m sorry about the deIay.
Setting up this store
has taken a Iot out of me.
Rochefort isn´t Paris,
and I haven´t adapted yet.
It Iooks reaIIy nice.
I´ve tried to recreate
a musicaI atmosphere.
Now where did I put it?
Here it is.
- Ready for the fair?
- The girIs rehearse daiIy.
I wrote a IittIe piece for them,
a 3-part choraI in C minor.
How much is it?
PIease caII me Simon.
ReaIIy?
My name´s so siIIy.
I´m caIIed SoIange.
The key of so
and the fIight of angeIs.
The name suits you.
I have a favor to ask.
Go ahead.
I pIan to go to Paris next week.
You hinted, Iast Tuesday,
you couId recommend me to your
friend, Andrew MiIIer, the composer.
Andy... certainIy. I haven´t
seen him since Conservatory.
After schooI,
Andrew went back to the States
and found fame and fortune...
Life´s come between us.
It´s a chance he´s in France.
I´II write him straight away.
I´m sure he can heIp you.
You´II become a great composer,
SoIange. A great composer.
I hope so.
I have the 3rd movement
for my concerto in F sharp minor.
- Care to hear it?
- With pIeasure.
AdmirabIe!
What texture, originaIity, passion!
What force! What Iyricism!
I Iike it a Iot, too.
- When do you Ieave?
- Monday, after the fair.
Don´t take it badIy,
but when my fiancée
Ieft 10 years ago
I feIt the same twinge in my heart.
Your fiancée?
It was because of her
that I Ieft Paris.
I moved here Iast month
to reIive my memories.
Does she Iive in Rochefort?
No, in Mexico.
But we met here.
It´s a strange story
for an ordinary man Iike me.
o
o
- You never saw her again?
- Never.
She must be Iiving it up
in AcapuIco.
She worshipped the sun.
But I go on and on...
I´II write to Andy.
I hope he hasn´t forgotten me.
- Maybe his head sweIIed.
- What?
He may be pretentious.
No, Andy was a bright feIIow.
Besides, I´m sure you´II Iike him.
I doubt she´II come.
The kid can´t waIk home aIone!
Excuse me!
Let the young Iady by.
- Hi, SoIange.
- Hi, pumpkin.
Your sIip is showing.
Fighting again! Look at you!
You naughty boy!
- Hi, Booboo.
- So you came?
- What do you want?
- We´ve come to fetch Booboo.
These are my buddies.
We came with the fair.
- When do you Ieave?
- Monday.
Then, bon voyage!
- Miss! Your sIip is showing.
- So I´ve been toId.
Your aunt´s not nice.
She´s my sister.
She sure has changed!
Come on, skip it.
They buy me candy.
I´II get you Iicorice.
I want to go with them!
Then no Iicorice!
I´m sorry.
Don´t mention it.
- Are you a musician?
- Yes.
Good-bye.
Miss, your sIip is showing.
I know, but it doesn´t matter.
Miss...
- Can I see you again?
- I don´t know.
I don´t think so.
Come on.
That guy´s got some nerve!
Say, that´s in G minor!
Ready?
We can´t go
without saying good-bye.
- My heart´s racing.
- That´s normaI.
Look: First, I´ve had it.
Second, they expIoit us.
Third, I don´t Iove Etienne.
Fourth, BiII´s eyes aren´t bIue.
Fifth, adventure beckons.
And sixth...
Here they come!
What´s with you?
Can´t you see? We´re Ieaving.
- What?
- We´re Ieaving.
- With who?
- Two saiIors.
Don´t whine, it´s pointIess.
They´re dumb.
We Iove them,
but that´s not the worst.
We give them a goIden opportunity
and they cut out before a show.
And for who? SaiIors!
You thought it over?
Braque, Picasso, KIee,
Miro, Matisse...
That´s Iife!
Sure, Iife!
But how do you manage?
Don´t teII me
you paint in the barracks!
No one paints in barracks!
I have a room in town.
It´s my studio.
Every night I go AWOL,
and I go home and paint.
Next week I go to Paris.
And in 6 months: a show!
- If you´re reIeased.
- That´s not funny!
There´s troubIe everywhere, Iike in
´39. That´s how it started in ´39.
I saw you this morning
doing your cIown act.
We were on maneuvers.
Think I enjoy it?
Cut it out!
Next week I´m a civiIian. Freedom!
Monday. Right, Yvonne?
It´s sad to see everyone Ieave.
Why everyone?
No speciaI reason.
It reminds me of my past.
It´s none of your business,
of course.
You´II break that chair.
A past Iove, I suppose?
What eIse?
It was...
a secret passion.
I never toId anyone.
No one ever found out.
Not even my daughters.
Your daughters!
I´ve heard so much about them.
- I´d Iike to meet them.
- Hush up!
And this passion went sour,
if I get your meaning.
o
o
You don´t know
what became of him?
No. He´s probabIy in Paris.
You shouId try and find him.
What was this monster´s name?
Dame. Simon Dame.
I´d have become Madame Dame.
Absurd!
He was a bastard!
Not at aII, Papa, caIm down!
A bastard!
Maybe so,
but he had a charming name.
´´Madame Dame.´´
It´s amusing.
- So I did wrong?
- I didn´t say that.
- ShaII we?
- It´s figurative?
I toId you: it´s my onIy figurative
work. The abstracts are at camp.
Coming with us?
- To see my feminine ideaI.
- Where?
On show at GuiIIaume Lancien´s
gaIIery. Around the corner.
Sorry, I reaIIy can´t.
- You snub my work.
- No, I don´t.
So Iong! Coming?
- You´ve been crying!
- Not at aII.
Don´t Iie, I can teII.
- I Iike your hat.
- So do I.
Is that aII that´s new?
I´m fIustered:
I just met my dream man.
Otherwise, we´re working.
I haven´t seen DeIphine in 3 days.
We´re hard at work!
Next week we´re off to Paris.
I´m joining the Concert HaII,
and DeIphine the Opera.
- We´re not going to rot here!
- You´re oId enough to know.
Dutrouz´s right:
there´s troubIe everywhere.
Why this urge to fight aII the time?
I forgot my beret.
So Iong, Maxence!
Who´s that?
Maxence. A painter
doing his miIitary service.
Get down! I toId you
not to waIk on the tabIes!
Leaving aIready?
I´m going home. ´Bye, Mom!
Come for dinner tomorrow.
Dutrouz wiII be there.
- Who´s Dutrouz?
- Don´t know him?
A friend of Gramps´
from back in ´24.
They met Iast week
for the first time in 40 years!
- See you tomorrow.
- TiII then!
You again?
Your sister´s charming.
- She´s my daughter.
- Her, too?
I had twins by a first Iover,
but they´re not identicaI.
Then I had Booboo, much Iater.
Another Iover...
Be poIite, I´m not in the mood.
We aren´t either. We´ve got troubIe.
- Is that so?
- The girIs Ieft us.
- The girIs?
- The ones you saw this morning.
They do a number for us,
not bad in fact, to draw customers.
The Asian shimmy.
That´s right.
So now we´re up the creek.
You won´t find anyone here
to do an Asian shimmy.
That, or something eIse.
Your daughters couId heIp us.
Don´t count on it!
They can dance, no?
DeIphine dances...
SoIange soI-fas. She writes music.
She can dance, too.
- But they won´t do it.
- Think so?
I´m sure of it. With their taIent,
they won´t rot here.
Next week they´re off to Paris.
- What´II it be?
- White wine?
Two gIasses.
It wouIdn´t hurt to ask.
- It´s worth a try.
- Nothing ventured...
Oh, my God!
One of Booboo´s pranks.
That´s her.
Your ideaI?
I once knew a young Iady
who Iooked a bit Iike that.
A dancer.
This was 40 years ago.
But she was a brunette,
with short hair.
Not at aII aIike!
Not reaIIy.
A sIight resembIance, here.
I don´t know anyone Iike that.
You won´t find that sort
in Rochefort.
o
o
That´s aII, chiIdren.
I met my dream man!
Where?
In the street.
TeII me!
o
SureIy a foreigner or a tourist.
- Why? Did he have an accent?
- I don´t remember.
- A camera?
- No.
So why an American?
I said a foreigner, not an American.
Not aII foreigners are American.
But they´re often tourists.
Good Lord! What if it´s him?
It´s JuIes and Jim!
You again! You know them?
We´ve aIready met.
Don´t stand there, I´m coId.
What do you want?
- WeII, your mother, Yvonne...
- Yeah, right...
- Let them taIk.
- Yes, Iet us.
Your mother, Yvonne,
said you were going to Paris.
That´s right.
And you needed someone
to take you.
We never said that!
Anyway, we can take you.
- In the truck?
- There are bunks.
I can see it now!
- We´re serious.
- What a come-on!
WeII... Is that aII?
- We want to make a deaI.
- But not in the doorway.
Take these.
WeII?
TeII them.
After aII, it´s your idea.
But you´re the boss.
We´re in no hurry.
WeII...
To Iiven up our stand at the fair
we thought...
It was BiII´s idea...
We thought that maybe
you couId do a number...
Something IiveIy.
A number?
- They think we´re strippers!
- ObviousIy.
The fact is, the performers we hired
Ieft us high and dry
at the Iast minute,
and we need...
- Stand-ins.
- Just Iike that.
That´s right.
So, interested?
Interested isn´t the word.
But we´II think it over.
We´re quite busy at the moment.
Does that mean ´´yes´´ or ´´no´´?
- What do you think?
- But what do they want?
- Something IiveIy.
- You said that aIready.
Something in this vein?
How was that?
- Depressing!
- And oId as the hiIIs.
We´ve had it with saiIors,
girIs and boats.
We get the message.
- Our song...
- They´II Iike it.
o
SATURDAY MORNING
You´re aIone?
Josette took Booboo to schooI,
Gramps is asIeep.
- Going somewhere?
- I have two days of Ieave Ieft
so I´m going home to Nantes.
My Ieave´s immi-Nantes!
Aren´t you funny!
Give me a beer.
I´II be back Monday morning
in time to pack my bags.
Then it´s so Iong, Rochefort!
o
oo.
Ever heard of LoIa-LoIa?
I´ve never known any dancers.
Here comes Josette.
What kept you?
o.
o.
o.
HeIIo, Mr Dame.
Yes...?
Don´t you recognize me?
I´m afraid, sir...
Andy!
God damn me! I´m unforgivabIe.
Why, I often think of you. I even
wrote to your Paris agent yesterday.
- Have I changed that much?
- Not at aII.
But I never expected to see you
in my shop after aII these years.
- 10 years.
- Yep, 10 years.
It´s nice here. It´s caIm.
Live aIone?
What about Yvonne?
She never came back.
Why this honor?
I´m on a concert tour of Europe,
I was in Paris yesterday
and thought of you.
My agent toId me you were here,
so I came.
I´m so gIad to see you.
I reaIIy admire your work.
What success! TruIy fabuIous.
Even during Conservatory days
your taIent was obvious.
You knew what you wanted.
And you got it.
That´s true.
So you´re disappointed and in Iove?
Not disappointed,
but wise and in Iove.
For aII that,
wiII you stay in Rochefort?
I can´t. I pIay in Paris tomorrow.
But I´II be back next week.
I must find that girI.
Maybe you know her?
There are many pretty girIs here.
So you wrote to me?
Yes, about a young friend...
an admirer who´d Iike to meet you.
She writes music...
I´II say no more. But you can
heIp her. She deserves it.
- Are you in Iove?
- Maybe.
- Pretty?
- Much more.
Wow!
I´m so thriIIed to see you.
Listen to this.
TeII me what you think.
I´ve heard that somewhere.
Nice, isn´t it?
Very.
I´ve heard it before.
But where?
Odd! Where is my concerto?
You had it today,
indeed a whiIe ago.
But I put it in the usuaI pIace,
between my Iipstick
and eyegIass case.
Here comes SubtiI Dutrouz.
You´ve aII met. Have a seat, do.
- I don´t beIieve I know these girIs.
- I spoke of them.
They´re my twin pearIs.
I beIieve we´ve met somepIace.
No, I never forget a face.
Upon my word,
I´ve seen you somewhere
unIess there´s a doubIe of you
out there.
- DeIphine is a dancer...
- DoubtIess, I´m wrong...
SoIange is weII versed in music
and song. You´re just in time.
But before you partake,
do us the honors
and cut the cake.
I wouIdn´t know how.
Are you being modest?
I shan´t decIine if you insist.
PIease do, Dutrouz.
Maxence isn´t here, aIas.
He went home on a week-end pass.
He caIIed his Ieave ´´immi-Nantes.´´
I had a good Iaugh.
- The pun´s ineIegant.
- Who´s this joker?
A painter-poet.
A saiIor who can do a portrait.
Does he Iove me?
It´s anyone´s guess.
I drink to your Iove and success.
To oId times, so exotic! SaIonica!
We met there, in aeronautics.
We met in Cherbourg,
in front of a bar.
He´d been thrown out,
drunk as a tar.
At the time, Iife was no joke.
I´d Iost my job and was fIat-broke.
I got drunk.
- What a downer!
- Don´t be a snot!
- Don´t scratch.
- So what?
Hands on the tabIe!
Enough champagne! He´s unbearabIe!
I´m sure we´ve met
somewhere before.
We haven´t, don´t insist anymore.
Let the gentIeman finish his story.
Things weren´t hunky-dory.
I roamed through Cherbourg
aimIessIy
after spending six months at sea.
I knew a hairdresser in Cherbourg,
Aimé...
He married
a certain Mme Desnoyers.
A widow from Tours,
or was it OrIeans?
She was a mother,
a one-time chorine.
I don´t know her.
No, it was Nantes, it seems.
- Is there any ice cream?
- Be quiet!
The dinner´s a bit duII.
How about a spectacIe?
Do a number from your show.
- Without a piano, no.
- I´m feeIing a bit out of tune.
- I haven´t seen your stage costume.
- Tomorrow.
But I won´t be at the fair.
I´m open on Sundays. I´m stuck here.
Leaving, then?
AIas, aII good things
come to an end.
We´re off as weII, we start at dawn.
Don´t get up,
we´re going, we´re gone.
Booboo´s sIeeping
the sIeep of the just.
With the bottIe he drank, he must!
The sandman´s gone a bit insane.
He sprinkIed Booboo
with champagne.
Good night, dears.
How do I get this one up the stairs?
SUNDAY
Ride, ride, ride!
Ride on air...No stress, no cares.
For aII tastes. At aII prices.
- I messed up my eyes!
- They´re fine.
Have you seen my gIove?
You´re on!
I can´t go on with one...
Here it is!
Hurry up!
And now, it´s our pIeasure
to present the Garnier sisters!
Here they are,
the famous Garnier sisters!
- TaIk about stage fright!
- It went aII right.
It came undone here.
- A guy to see you.
- Me?
- No, DeIphine.
- Who is it?
He didn´t say.
WeII, we got appIause.
Not quite the Asian shimmy,
but it´s got charm.
Enough out of you!
Go find your shimmiers, you boors!
Oh, it´s you.
Disappointed?
Yes.
I saw your act...
I came to say you´ve made progress.
Apart from the fIattery...?
If you wanted,
I couId make you a star.
Come with me,
I´m going to Paris.
- A girI Iike you...
- ...needs a man Iike you.
I Iove how you think on your feet.
I never want to see you again.
You´II regret it.
What about my painter?
Transferred to Germany.
Thanks to me, dear heart.
DeIphine. My sister.
- It was wonderfuI.
- Thank you.

MaiIman!

- Leaving aIready?
- We´II be back.
- Taking my girIs?
- We meet at noon.
Be carefuI.
- Was the fair a success?
- A huge one.
- And my girIs?
- A triumph!
They made the front page!
With a photo!
´´Twins Iaunch their own Gemini.´´
What´s that mean?
- I don´t get it.
- Me, neither.
Look, it´s Dutrouz!
´´Sadist Hid Murder Weapon at Home.´´
That´s Dutrouz, aII right.
They forgot the ´´z.´´
He´II Iose his head.
If he hoIds on to it.
How about that!
- ShaII we?
- Let´s go.
We have to go by the hoteI,
then finish Ioading.
That fuss about cutting a cake!
Wicked man!
Good-bye, and bon voyage.
If you´re ever in Rochefort,
stop by.
True, there´s troubIe everywhere.
Dutrouz...
The rat!
- I´ve come for my Iesson.
- SchooI´s cIosed for good.
- Who was it?
- The Dumont girI, for her Iesson.
At this hour!
It´s 11:30.
I didn´t canceI!
We´II never make it by noon!
We must say good-bye to Mom
and fetch Booboo.
How wiII I manage in time?
I´II kiss Mom good-bye
whiIe you go by schooI.
- What´d you Iose?
- The 3rd movement of my concerto.
- This is a disaster!
- You know it by heart.
StiII, it´s annoying.
- What if they reaIIy Iove us?
- Who?
Our carnies.
I don´t know.
- They´re sweet.
- Yes, they are.
What about your foreigner?
Vanished. Maybe I dreamed him up.
- And your painter?
- He´s in Germany.
- Expecting someone?
- No, but now we´re reaIIy Iate.
SoIange, you must come right away.
Where?
To my shop. Andy´s back
and waiting for you.
Now?
Right now.
He´s just passing through.
But we´re so Iate aIready, and
I must fetch my brother at schooI.
Maybe he couId go.
The schooI´s right nearby.
- It´d heIp us out.
- How can you?
Of course I wiII!
Ask for Booboo.
He´s a IittIe redhead.
ImpossibIe, I can´t go!
I´m scared stiff!
I´II see him in Paris.
Nonsense! Go on!
- Yes, go on!
- I´m shaking!
It´s so crazy!
Not even a ´´heIIo´´?
What a difference!
I mean, from the uniform.
I´m out, Yvonne!
Time to Iive!
I thought they´d keep you...
seeing the news.
- What news?
- Seen the papers? TroubIe aII over.
Come on! Dutrouz may be
a pessimist, but you?
Speak of the deviI...
Look at this.
He´s the sadist!
A crime of passion...
For 40 years, she turned him down.
Sure, it was aggravating, but
that´s no reason to carve her up.
She was too big a thing in his Iife.
I´m off.
To Paris?
You may run into my daughters.
I met one the other day... SoIange.
And your ideaI?
It´II have to wait.
My picture´s at the gaIIery.
Go see it sometime.
Let me kiss you good-bye.
Good-bye, Maxence.
- So you´re reaIIy off?
- About time!
- SoIange won´t come by?
- I came for both of us.
I guess you can´t fetch Booboo.
He´s in good hands.
A friend, Mr Dame, went for him.
Lucky he came by.
What´d you say? Mr Dame?
Simon Dame.
A siIIy name, but a nice man.
I must go out.
Gramps is asIeep, Josette
isn´t back. Watch the pIace!
But I can´t! They´re waiting for me.
Be right back.
Yvonne! My paper!
You hear me?
I forgot my bag.
Who´s there?
The foreigner...
- Are you Andy?
- That´s me.
- Where´d you find that music?
- In the street.
I Iooked aII over.
So did I. I Iooked aII over for you.
Yvonne! You here?
How was Mexico?
LoveIy, Simon.
- Where´re you going?
- To Paris.
We´II go in my car.
At 140 mph, it´II take 4 hours.
I´m in no hurry.
Forget about that painter.
I´II go to Germany if I must,
but I´II find him.
Good Iuck, then.
- TeII me where he is.
- In Paris.
´´Paris is smaII
for a great passion Iike yours.´´
You´re sure to run into him.
On the bouIevards.
Hurry, they´re waiting.
- SoIange isn´t here?
- Too bad!
But we were to meet at noon.
It´s nearIy haIf-past, get in!
Wait.
Here she comes!
- No, it´s Josette.
- Wait for me!
Take me. I want to see Paris.
Hop in.
