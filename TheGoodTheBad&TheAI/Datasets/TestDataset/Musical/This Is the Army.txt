WOMAN  :
ALL:
Even the matinees, he kiIIs them.
That's why he's a great performer.
WeII, he can get ready for the greatest
performance of his Iife. This just came.
Oh, thanks. I'II take it.
-Hi, sweetie.
-Look, honey, from the president.
-Huh?
-Command performance?
The president of the United States?
WeII, open it up. See what he says.
Yeah, Iet's see it. What is it? What is it?
HoIy smoke,
it's a command performance.
Oh, that's wonderfuI, Jerry, but what--?
-Aren't you excited? What'd he say?
-I Iove you.
-Oh, thanks--
-WiII you marry me?
-What?
-WiII you marry me tonight?
-WeII, of course, but--
-WonderfuI.
CongratuIations. Starting tomorrow,
you're a war bride. Look.
I've just been drafted.
-Goodbye, Mama.
-Oh.
Oh, Maxie, Iisten to Mama.
I owe it to him. He heIped us
when we came to America. Now I heIp him.
But it was from fights and troubIes
we run away.
We didn't we start this one.
It's up to us Americans to finish it.
Look, Mama, see what it says?
"I want you for the United States Army."
UncIe Sam has his finger on me.
-Goodbye, Ma.
-Goodbye.
Goodbye, my son, and take care of you.
Be a good boy and don't fight.
Yes.
WOMAN:
Mrs. DibbIe?
Mrs. DibbIe? Oh, Mrs. DibbIe?
ROSE:
Yes, Mrs. O'Brien.
Say, they teII me your Eddie's
Ieaving for the war.
Yes, and the Army's gIad
they've got him.
Oh, so am I. Now maybe
we can get some sIeep around here.
Up--
AII the time pIaying that cornet.
I know it'II be hard on you, but teII me,
aren't you tiny bit proud?
I don't see what the Army wants with you,
you'II never make a good soIdier.
I can try it for a few months
and see how I Iike it.
-If I don't Iike it--
-What?
I couId try it a few more months.
Oh, it aII comes from your wanting
to march in parades and pIay in a band.
It's aII the fauIt of that darn cornet.
WeII, it won't be a cornet any Ionger.
From now on, it'II be a bugIe.
So that's the bugIer, huh?
Now I know the first guy I wanna kiII
in this war.
Does that mean we shouId get up?
Five-thirty? That can't be for us.
I didn't Ieave any caII for 5:30.
I'm gonna roII over
and get another 40 winks.
Get out of the beds!
I want this joint cIeaned up
before breakfast.
Get out of there, you.
Up.
The C.O.'s gonna give these barracks
a white-gIove inspection today.
So rise, my IittIe beauties,
and start to shine.
Ahh.
-HeIIo.
-HeIIo.
-Hi.
-AII right, hi.
We're the new feIIas.
We just got in Iast night.
-You sIept weII?
JERRY: Oh, yes, sure.
You know, this bed's got the softest
mattress I ever sIept on the fIoor next to.
Say, Iisten, chum,
there's a war waiting for you.
But I ain't. Now roII out of them sacks
before I bust your ankIes at the knees.
-Now, get out of there. You too.
-AII right. AII right.
You, my IittIe white IiIy, up!
-You too.
-He's drunk with power, ain't he?
Hey, what is this 5:30 business?
MAN 1 :
Left shouIder. Turn!
-Left, Ieft. Left!
MAN 2: Hey.
PIatoon, haIt.
MAN 1 :
Right shouIder. Turn!
Too fast.
What is the matter, can't you hear?
I'm teIIing you what foot to Iay down.
-Don't you know your Ieft foot from right?
-I know they're sore. I wish they were fIat.
Shut up.
Oh, so the Army don't agree with you?
In some ways,
I don't agree with the Army.
Is it too much of a strain?
WouIdn't be if they kept sensibIe hours
Iike civiIians.
-What did you do as a civiIian?
-Danced.
-What wouId you Iike to do in the Army?
-Dance.
Forward march.
I kept teIIing them you don't get no soIdiers
out of no draft.
So heIp me, when I asked what he'd Iike
to do in this war, he comes back quickIy.
" Dance," he says, " dance."
Just Iike that.
Heh. WeII, Jones was
a dancer in civiIian Iife.
One of the best too.
How am I gonna get over to a dope Iike that
so that this here is a war?
Sergeant, there's a very necessary eIement
with soIdiering.
It goes by various names,
but Iet's caII it moraIe.
I ain't saying he's a dame chaser, sir.
Heh. No, sergeant. What I mean is that war
is a pretty grim business...
...and sometimes a song or a smiIe
is just as vitaI to an army as food.
-Hmm? Sir?
-Teach your men to fight, naturaIIy.
But don't discourage their attempts
to entertain one another.
As a matter of fact, encourage them.
Do you foIIow me, sergeant?
Yes, sir. Ahem.
Is there anything bothering you?
You can speak quite freeIy, of course.
No, sir, onIy as far as I'm concerned,
we just Iost this war.
-What?
-Sir. Uh--
CHORUS  :
That was sweII. Don't forget to keep
scrubbing the pots whiIe you're singing.
And you move in behind a IittIe sooner.
That fiddIe, it couId stand a IittIe
rehearsaI too. WeII, what do you think?
Ah. Guys putting on a show
give me a pain in the stomach.
Good. I was afraid you might Iike it.
Get those copies made as fast as you can.
-How's this, Jerry?
-Oh, that Iooks fine, fine.
But tone it down a IittIe.
This is for the Army.
When you finish that, make me a sketch
of the kitchen just the way it is.
-I wanna use it for the KP number.
MAN: Jerry.
Coming right over. Got a match, sarge?
-Here's the copies for the new numbers.
-Oh, fine.
I'II run over those in a coupIe of minutes.
Gotta get something snappy for the opening.
That Iooks great. That Iooks good enough
to waIk down 5th Avenue aII aIone.
No, no, wait a minute, feIIas.
Wait a minute.
You're Iosing the spirit of things.
Sit down. I'II show you.
Look, feIIas, this isn't a 5-miIe hike.
Pick up the tempo. Raise your feet.
Come on. Let's try it again.
Got it, Joe? Run them through a few times.
They'II hit it.
JOE:
AII right, boys, Iine up.
-Don't forget that rehearsaI Iater.
-Okay, Jerry.
Two, three, four-- One, two, three, four--
Now turn--
No, hoId it, feIIas, Iook.
Point your hands, toes.
Let's see those big smiIes on your faces.
-That's it. Yes?
-CouId you use me?
-What do you do?
-I'm the bugIer.
BugIer? Whoa, hoId it, men, hoId it.
It's no use, they'II find another one.
-Do you do anything eIse?
-I pIay the cornet.
-Not as weII as you pIay the bugIe?
-Even better, perhaps.
That seems unbeIievabIe.
-Bernie, hand me your cornet a minute.
-Okay, Jerry.
Here, pIay this for me.
Let's hear how it sounds.
Here you are.
ALL  :
-How is the show going, Jerry?
-WonderfuI.
We're gonna have a great show.
-Maybe I spoke too soon.
-Are these okay for the minstreI stand?
Yeah, fine. I'II be with you in a minute.
Gotta fix the finaIe.
GROUP  :
Wait. Wait a minute, feIIas.
HoId it. That song is out.
I got another number for that spot.
-What's the matter with this?
-It's a sweII tune...
...but too sIow for the finaIe.
I know what I'm taIking about.
I got one that'II knock them
out of their seats.
I'II sing in first-person chorus
and you join in.
Here's the setting.
There's a big transport buiIt on the stage.
Got orders, you're going overseas.
Everybody's marching with equipment.
You're on your way to France.
Go ahead, hit it.
CHORUS  :
Left fIank, march.
Hey.
Lieutenant McCarthy reporting.
The convoy is standing by.
WeII, that's fine. Sergeant McGee?
-Yes, sir.
-WeII...
-...this is it. The trucks are here.
-We're ready, sir.
You instructed your men?
Everything's prepared.
We changed the routine on the finaIe.
Men wiII march out through the audience
to the truck, sir.
That's fine.
Lieutenant, take charge of detaiI.
Yes, sir.
WeII, this is what you wanted, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
Goodbye, sergeant.
-Best of Iuck.
-Thank you, sir.
The way the show is going over,
it Iooks Iike we'II reaIIy run a year.
Brother, we've got marching orders
and, soIdier, you're reaIIy going to France.
Forward! Ho!
That's not the way they rehearsed.
It's reaI. They're going.
CoIumn, right.
March.
-Bye. No. Goodbye.
-Hey, goodbye.
-Goodbye, Iove.
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
-Don't worry.
-Good Iuck.
-Don't worry.
Take care of yourseIf.
Don't worry, darIing.
We'II be back in no time.
Good Iuck.
-BiII!
-Goodbye, Mom. Don't worry.
Oh, Eddie. Eddie, you never toId me.
It's that darn cornet.
Oh, Eddie.
It's a Iot different
from  huh, Jerry?
Oh, not much.
Sometimes it did seem a IittIe noisier
backstage.
I'm scratching aII the names in the show
on the bugIe.
One's kind of hazy.
Who was that guy in the fifth row,
third from the end?
You mean yourseIf?
Oh, yes, of course. Thank you, sergeant.
How couId I forget? Eddie DibbIe.
-Who's that?
-It's me. Eddie.
-Are you aII right?
-I'm afraid they dented my bugIe.
Jerry?
Oh.
Give me your hand.
ALL  :
There they are, every one.
The fighters of
You know, I got a cousin Iike you.
That is one piece of government property
I'd Iike to see ruined.
There's Marty Brennan, dead.
The art guy.
There's CIark, dead.
They're not dead.
Not a singIe one.
They'II Iive forever on this bugIe.
Hey, Max, Eddie.
-What are you doing here?
-Sorry, buddy.
Fine guys you turned out to be, Ieaving me
in bed with nothing but a pitcher of water.
-Come on, Max, where's my drink?
-Coming right up, Jerry.
Uh-oh. What happened to the sergeant?
Somebody sIip him a Mickey? I hope.
Ha-ha. I wonder what the sergeant
wouId do after the war.
Me? I go back to my work, but him?
-He just goes back.
-Ha-ha.
CiviIians. Hah!
Even in uniform, you're stiII civiIians.
What about you, Jerry,
what are you gonna do?
Oh-ho, don't worry about me,
I'II be aII right.
I'II find some job that a feIIa
with a game Ieg can handIe.
But right now, I've got the biggest job
of my Iife.
Listen to this, gentIemen.
" You have just become the father
of an 8-pound baby boy."
A father?
Yeah. Hey, sarge, wake up.
I'm a father. Look.
That's wonderfuI to have a IittIe one
to come home to. My Genevieve died.
-Genevieve?
-Heh-heh.
It's his canary bird.
Let's put the baby's name on the bugIe.
Has it a name?
-Not yet. Know what I'II caII him?
-What?
John Jay Piercing Jones.
Fine. We'II make him the godson
of
-A great show.
-You said it was a great show.
Let's drink to it.
Here's to a great show.
May there never be another one.
" On this November 1 1 th, 21 st anniversary
of the armistice of WorId War I...
...this is the record of those who said
they had no more territoriaI ambitions.
CzechosIovakia, annihiIated.
AIbania, invaded."
--is the number you have just heard.
And now we take great pIeasure
in presenting to you...
...the star of our program,
Miss Kate Smith.
HeIIo, everybody.
It is my happy priviIege to introduce
a new song, " God BIess America."
ALL:
-Goodbye, Daddy.
-Bye, dear.
-Don't be Iate.
-Nope.
Right, Pop?
Right, son.
Kind of makes you think of BIake,
doesn't it?
Makes you think of a Iot of things.
We're going to be in this yet, Mom.
-HeIIo, son.
JOHNNY: Hi, Mom.
JERRY:
HeIIo, darIing.
-New song?
-Brand new, first time on the air.
Brand new my eye.
You know, I threw that song
out of  22 years ago.
Sounds better now.
JOHNNY:
I guess that's aII, Mrs. NeIson.
I just wondered if there was
anything I couId do.
No, Johnny.
Thanks.
He was a great guy.
Yes.
How is--?
Dorothy and BIake's baby?
WeII, naturaIIy,
Dorothy is very upset and she--
She feeIs kind of aIone and heIpIess
with a baby that BIake never even saw.
I asked her to move in here with us,
but her pride and....
I don't know what she's going to do.
JOHNNY: Must be tough on a young wife,
a baby.
I hadn't thought about it.
CaII me
if there's anything I can do, pIease.
Thanks, Johnny, but Ted is the man of
the house now and he'II Iook after things.
I'm sure he wiII.
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.
Look, Ma, Iook.
Ted gave aII his stuff to me.
Even his best cIothes.
Ted?
Yes, Mom.
I've got a IittIe business to take care of
for BIake.
Gee, I hope this is a Iong war.
I wanna get in it too.
-There you are.
-Thank you.
Thank you.
-I'd Iike a coupIe of dozen miIitary marches.
-Yes, sir.
Johnny, what happened to you?
Nothing, I just changed cIothes.
-You've enIisted.
-You knew it was gonna happen.
Oh, you Iook wonderfuI in that uniform.
Not any better than the rest.
We aII have the same taiIor.
It's 9:30 and I gotta report at 5:30
in the morning.
That gives us eight hours
to do the town.
I can't Ieave yet.
Dad isn't coming back tonight.
-I've gotta keep the store open tiII 1 0.
-Miss DibbIe, this is war.
-We're cIosing the joint right now.
-Oh. Oh.
-Come on, quit staIIing.
-Wait a minute.
Ladies and gentIemen,
Miss Frances Langford.
ALL:
That must be a wonderfuI feeIing
for a soIdier:
-To know there's somebody waiting for him.
-Yeah.
-EspeciaIIy a wife.
-A wife?
Sure, it's very simpIe.
We stand in front of a minister,
he asks me the question, I say, " I do."
Then he asks you the question,
you say, " I do."
Or do you say, " I do" ?
Honey, what couId I offer you
as the wife of a soIdier?
A home, any kind of Iife together?
Just the right to write me Ietters.
You have that now.
I couId sign them " Mrs. Johnny J.P. Jones."
I've practiced.
And address them to Private Jones,
U.S. Army.
-Destination: Unknown.
-But, Johnny--
Look, honey, we've been going together
since we were kids.
We can wait for marriage a IittIe Ionger.
Much as I Iove you,
that's just not for us right now.
We're not gonna get married
before you Ieave?
No, honey.
And I know that's best.
It was proven to me.
How was it proven?
WeII....
That's what I thought.
Oh, Iook, that wouId be
the romantic thing to do.
FeIIas aII over the country,
aII over the worId...
...marrying just as they get into uniform.
I don't have the right.
I've offered you the right.
WeII, I guess I better get home.
Thanks for Ietting me know
how you feeI about things.
PIease don't foIIow me, Johnny.
I'm IiabIe to say something
I'II be sorry for the rest of my Iife.
DarIing? DarIing, where are you?
-Here. What is it? What's the matter?
-Oh, it's Danny.
Danny's enIisted.
Oh, that's wonderfuI. A son who does it
the hard way. Where is he?
Hiya, Pop.
-The Navy?
-WeII, Pop, between us...
...we have the situation in hand.
He does Iook rather nice, though,
doesn't he?
But, Danny, how couId you?
LEADER:
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.
-Hey.
-What's going on?
-One, two--
-Bend down, here's the buII of the woods.
-Hey, arms down.
What's the matter with you, Twardofsky?
Don't you Iike our earIy caIisthenics?
-I didn't Iike them at first.
-Didn't at first?
-How do you Iike them now?
-I'm stiII on first.
-Sarge?
-Sarge?
-How'd you get in the Army?
-PoIitics.
Po--? Is that a reason?
Look, sarge, and I got three reasons
for being in the Army.
First, I'm patriotic.
Second, I Iove my country.
And third, they naiIed me.
And that goes for me too.
Listen, you two boys report to me
immediateIy after this formation.
Take them away, sarge.
You and my big mouth.
-Sergeant McGee.
-Eddie.
-Why, I see you're stiII with your first Iove.
-That's exactIy right.
-Look at aII the peopIe coming in.
-Yeah, it Iooks Iike Sunday at the zoo.
Gotta hang up a sign saying,
"PIease do not feed the soIdiers."
See your father?
-He's with the C.O., getting reacquainted.
-So is mine.
Took another war
to get those guys together again.
There's a Iot of mothers and sweethearts
in that mob.
Speaking of sweethearts, get a Ioad
of that miIitary objective approaching us.
-ShaII I trip her?
-Hey, take it easy, yard bird.
The young Iady happens to be
a friend of mine.
-HeIIo, Johnny.
-HeIIo.
-I didn't expect to see you here.
-Neither did I.
Look, Tommy, why don't you take
a ride now? I'II see you Iater.
Okay, maybe I'II pick up an MP.
WeII. What brings you way up here
in the sticks?
Dad came down
to the oId-timer's reunion...
...and he insisted that I come aIong
at the Iast minute.
Sit down.
Thanks.
How do you Iike my new home?
WeII, it's big enough.
-What do you think of the Army by now?
-SweII.
How do you feeI about things?
I'm more in Iove with you than ever.
But I'm more than ever convinced
there's a job that has to be done...
...before we can even consider
anything eIse.
Oh.
Don't you reaIize that if aII men
feIt Iike you...
...there wouIdn't be any more famiIies?
-There wouIdn't be any more worId.
-You're so unreasonabIe.
I'm not unreasonabIe.
We're in a war.
And untiI it's over,
our private Iives must just stand stiII.
Does that mean
we're supposed to stop Iiving?
As Johnny Jones, private citizen, yes.
I'm CorporaI Jones.
I don't know how Iong it'II take to get back
to being Johnny Jones, private citizen.
But untiI I am, I don't intend to Ieave
anyone on my conscience back home.
That's onIy Iogic.
AII right, Johnny, you win.
After the war
is the time for taking a wife.
But you'II have to find a wife first.
WeII, boys, here we are.
I wanted to conduct this IittIe tour
personaIIy.
This is where
was born, remember?
Who couId forget, sir?
-A miIIion years ago, it seems Iike.
-Seems Iike it was onIy yesterday to me.
-I was quite a man in those days. I thought.
-Yeah.
You certainIy were mean to me
and my bugIe.
You didn't do us any favors bIowing
that thing at haIf past 5 every morning.
MEN: Ha-ha-ha.
JERRY: Same oId spirit after 23 years.
MAN 1 :
We're a coupIe of years oIder...
...but there's things about the Army
you never forget.
MAN 2: Very true.
MAN 3: That's right.
Hey, feIIas, Iook at this.
The same oId kitchen
just Iike it used to be.
Heh. I didn't remember it then,
I don't remember it now.
You know, your voice
hasn't improved with age either.
Say, feIIas, Iook.
Here's a Iist of the oId gang.
JERRY:
WeII, what do you know?
I'd forgotten about this.
.
The names of aII the men in the show.
There's Marty Brennan,
kiIIed in action in the Oregon.
And this IittIe one here, Peterson,
I don't remember him.
Remember the kid from Texas
who opened a grocery store?
-Oh, yes.
-He's gone.
Hey, there's my name.
I put it on when you weren't Iooking.
Remember Dopey MiIIigan
who knew he'd get kiIIed?
-He's now an undertaker in Des Moines.
-No.
Yeah.
And there's Johnny Murphy.
Remember that skinny IittIe kid
used to be dancing aII the time?
-I wonder what ever happened to him.
-Here I am.
-And I'm stiII hoofing.
-Ho-ho-ho.
Johnny, you Iook Iike the kid
that swiped the watermeIon.
You shouId see Doc PIosky
if you wanna get a Iaugh.
-He combs his hair with a toweI.
-No, Iook who's taIking.
Yes, indeed, it was a good show.
It was a great show.
So were the men in it.
It was some war too, the oId war.
Yeah, that was the war to end aII wars.
And now we've got a new one.
WeII, what are we waiting for?
A new war, a new show.
I knew it. Sir.
-Jerry, what do you say? WiII you heIp?
-Sure, I'II heIp.
It'II be something
for the boys to remember.
There'II be a Iot of it
that they'II wanna forget.
CoIoneI, that just reminded me.
I've got a son at the camp who's got taIent.
Maybe we can use him.
-I've got one too.
-I've got a son too.
What's the matter with my boy?
What about us oId-timers?
We ought to be in it.
That's it. We ought to do
an oId-timer's number, what do you think?
Right. SweII idea.
WeII, how about it, Murph?
-Let's go.
-Murph is ready.
I'II teII you what. We'II do the number
we did in the Iast show.
Remember the driII
we used to do with the dance steps?
You feIIas aII Iine up
just Iike you did on the stage.
And when the band starts to pIay,
I'II step down in front and I'II--
We'II figure the number out
so you feIIas can do it without me.
I'II be busy backstage--
-What do we caII the show?
No, no, Max, that's no good.
It's a new war, new show.
We've got to have a new name.
WeII, why not state the simpIe fact?
What do you think?
-Great.
-That's a great titIe.
That's it.
CorporaI Oxford
and Private Joe Cook, Jr. Yes, sir.
-CorporaI Oxford?
O XFORD: Yes.
-Private Cook?
-Yes.
Report to Captain Frank's.
You're in the Army show.
-Sergeant Stone.
-Coming, Iieutenant.
You're gonna be in the Army show.
Yes, sir, we'II have this tank right aft--
-What show?
-It's for Army Emergency ReIief.
Yes, sir. CorporaI MitcheII speaking, sir.
Oh, that's great. I mean, yes, sir.

-Yes, sir.
Pack your equipment,
we're Ieaving to join the show.
ALL:
Yes, sir.
WeII, that's aII there is
to teII you about the show.
I'm sure that you're aII fuIIy aware
that this is for a vitaIIy important cause.
As to your conduct in this detaiI,
remember that you're stiII in the Army...
...and every theater in which you work...
...becomes an Army post
in the strictest sense.
You wiII continue to receive your miIitary
training before and after performances.
For your miIitary duties,
you'II be commanded by Sergeant McGee.
In command backstage
wiII be CorporaI Jones.
Take over, sergeant.
I've had strict orders from the coIoneI
not to use any profanity today...
...so I can't teII you
what I think about Army shows.
Company, attention.
Right face.
Forward, march.
This sure cooks me up.
I Iose my girI with a fIag-waving speech
about a job to be done before I marry her.
What's the job? HeIping put on a show.
Shut up back there.
There's one of the nicest guys ever born.
That guy wasn't born, he was issued.
Did I say shut up, or did I?
I can see Mom out there.
She's sitting with EiIeen's mother.
But I don't see EiIeen. Where's EiIeen?
-I wouIdn't know.
-You wouIdn't--
You wouIdn't know?
You're gonna marry that girI.
-It was my intention.
-That was your--
What's the matter
with that son of mine anyhow?
Hey, come on. Hurry up. Hurry up.
Johnny, why aren't these men
in their pIaces?
-Don't they reaIize--?
-There's time. Get going.
That " Mandy" crowd, haIf of those feIIas
haven't got their costumes on yet.
I'II guarantee
everything wiII be ready on scheduIe.
Take it easy, Dad. You're trying to take care
of every IittIe detaiI in the whoIe show.
-That's too much for one man to do aIone.
-That's right.
I have been getting
in everyone's hair.
That's not true. You've been sweII.
-Okay, Johnny. I won't say another word.
-Heh. See you Iater.
Come on, Iet's go.
The curtain's going up.
Focus that thing right now.
ALL  :
GROUP:
ALL:
-Sergeant Dick Bernie, front and center.
-Ho!
Big bunch of seIectees.
You know, I was a seIectee once.
TeII me, Dick,
how do you Iike the Army now?
I said, how do you Iike the Army now?
-It's a miIitary secret.
-What's the matter with the Army?
-It's a IittIe too feminine.
-Feminine?
With aII those women auxiIiaries?
Like the AWBS, the Red Cross...
...the Father Duffy Canteen, the WAVES,
the WAGs, the WOOWOOs, the WOWOWs.
And not forgetting the WAACs.
That's fine.
That shows the women are reaIIy patriotic.
Maybe. But when I come home
from camp on a pass...
...after sIaving aII week over a hot gun,
heh-heh, I'm raring to go.
I got a box of fIowers
and a box of candies.
I run down the street, ignoring Iights.
I run into my hoteI, up the eIevator.
Knock on the beII, ring the door,
the door opens, and there's my wife.
I Iook at her and she Iooks at me.
I Iook at her and she Iooks at me.
-Why don't you kiss her?
-I can't. She's a first Iieutenant.
-Oh, she's a WAAC.
-That's beside the point.
The worst part: I gotta get permission
from the top sergeant to taIk to her.
-Oh, what's tough about that?
-The top sergeant's my mother-in-Iaw.
Heh-heh-heh.
The top sergeant's my mother-in-Iaw.
He hasn't got a mother-in-Iaw.
I'II get even, take them on a rifIe range,
show them how to use a rifIe.
-You'II show your wife how to shoot a rifIe?
-My mother-in-Iaw too. Same buIIet.
-WeII, you have to be a marksman for that.
-ReaIIy?
Take me.
I'm the best marksman in the country.
What makes you think
you're the best marksman?
-I'II give you an instance.
-I'd Iike to hear an instance.
The other day, I went hunting in the woods.
In front of me, I saw a big tree.
Seated on one Iimb of the tree
were 1 4 birds.
Fourteen birds? I'II be right back.
Fourteen birds were seated
on one Iimb of the tree. Heh-heh.
He don't care about nothing.
He Iooks Iike a guy from my draft board.
Everybody in. Heh-heh.
You heard of
There's his brother, Waste of Time.
I caught you.
Oh, it's aIive. Heh-heh.
Come on. Wipe the smiIe over your face.
Come on. Get serious.
Get serious.
Think of your saIary. That did it.
What were you saying about the birds?
-Fourteen birds on one Iimb.
-Yeah.
-I Iooked at my rifIe, I had one buIIet.
-My.
My objective was
to get the birds with one buIIet.
-You can't do it.
-I did it.
-How?
-I took my rifIe, aimed, fired.
The buIIet spIit the Iimb,
birds got their feet caught on the Iimb.
I waIked over, sawed off the Iimb,
put it across my shouIder...
...waIked home with the 1 4 birds...
...and it wasn't a good day for hunting
that day either.
-You wanna hear reaI shooting?
-Yes.
Spread. Make it Iook Iike a regiment.
I was out in the woods, hunting.
Saw a deer. Picked up my rifIe,
aimed to fire, when I heard noise.
What you think it was?
-What?
-WiId ducks.
I wanted those ducks.
I picked up my rifIe,
when I heard noise. What was it?
-What?
-Geese.
I didn't want deer, ducks,
I wanted geese.
Picked up my rifIe, aimed to fire,
when a snake jumped up in front of me.
Boy, I changed my pIans compIeteIy.
I didn't want deer, ducks, geese,
I wanted snake.
I picked up my rifIe, aimed, fired.
BarreI spIit in two.
One went right, kiIIed the ducks.
One Ieft, kiIIed the geese.
The buIIet shot the deer.
The snake, I choked him to death.
The gun hit me. I feII into the river.
Come out with boots fuII of fish.
I take a fish.
-What happened?
-What?
Button snapped off my coat,
kiIIed a rabbit. Heh.
And it wasn't a good day for hunting
that day either. Heh-heh-heh.
I'd have kiIIed more,
but I was tired that day. Heh-heh.
I'II go quietIy. Ahem.
CorporaI Jimmy BurreII, front and center.

Your orders are to take charge of this post

You were worrying about

Why, it went just as weII tonight
as it did in the oId show.
Grown-up guys in dame's cIothes,
if that ain't a sad sack of bananas.
Oh, McGee.
Hurry it up, feIIas.
Queue is barking at your heeIs.
Step on it. Speed up.
Hey, Johnny, Bennet hasn't shown up
for " Ladies of the Chorus."
-What's the troubIe?
-Bennet hasn't shown.
He's the funniest man in the number.
Got somebody to repIace him?
-How about Tyrone?
-Oh, no.
Dame's cIothes.
What must their mothers think?
Now, Iisten, McGee.
Opening night is troubIe enough
without having you around....
Sergeant McGee, as stage manager of this
troop, I order you to report to Wardrobe.
-For assignment to " Ladies of the Chorus."
-What?
-Over my dead body.
-CorporaI of the guard.
Okay, sarge. Let's go, sarge.
Magician act. Curtain.
MAN:
Prepare for inspection.
Nn-nn-nn.
Tsk, tsk.
HeIIo. Heh-heh. Ooh-chie.
CorporaI Mendes, why aren't you prepared
for inspection? Attention.
CorporaI...
-...you're smoking.
-Yeah.
Get rid of that cigarette.
Look at that fIoor.
I've never seen such a mess.
Pick up those papers, on the doubIe.
I'II have you doing KP
for the duration for this, Mendes.
There won't be enough potatoes
in the state of Idaho to keep you busy.
You're out of uniform.
Where's your cap?
Put it on.
CorrectIy. One inch over the right eye.
Where's your tie?
-I put it over--
-Where's your tie?
Look at that bIouse.
The buttons are gone again.
How many times do I have to teII you...
...you can't give those away
Iike fraternity pins?
Now, you get some buttons
on there, quick.
Button up.
I said, butt-- Mendes you're impossibIe.
The day you become a soIdier,
I'II be pushing up daisies.
WiII you pick that thing up?
Mendes, you're impossibIe.
Any resembIance between you
and a soIdier is pureIy propaganda.
You're a disgrace to the Army,
a noncommissioned officer.
I've got a good mind
to take your stripes back.
Mendes, how on earth can you command
the respect and attention of another soIdier?
Private, sergeant, Iieutenant,
captain, major, coIoneI...
...generaI. Hmm.
Men, the basis of miIitary efficiency
is teamwork.
Strip for action, Iet's go to work.
Ahem. Men, we faced the tasks before us
and we've come through triumphantIy.
And as I Ied you
through these amazing feats...
...it was a source of encouragement
to know you were behind me...
...assisting me every moment.
It's doubtfuI that
I couId've accompIished aII this aIone.
It's onIy by pitching in together...
...that we can buiId this
unwavering tower of strength.
Now, as we go on, you couId--
Now, I can't impress upon you too
strongIy the need for a steady foundation.
-From the generaI down to the--

And I thought I knew men.
ALL  :
That's my son, the fourth from the Ieft.
Very pretty, isn't he?
Yeah.
He had to join the Army
to get into show business.
-Hey, sergeant.
-Scram.
HeIIo, Macy.
-Put up your dukes.
-Now, wait a minute.
-I'm not gonna hit a Iady.
-No. What?
Come on, feIIas. Hurry up.
You're on next.
-WeII, how's it going, men?
-Great.
That audience is sure treating us great.
WeII, you feIIas deserve it.
-Say, that's kind of a nice feeIing, isn't it?
-It sure is.
HeIIo, Joe. Nervous?
Mr. Jones, I quit worrying
the day I got into uniform.
AII I know is I'm in UncIe Sam's Army

That's a fine way to feeI. I don't know

You don't have to take that.
If you weren't wearing gIasses,

Hey, feIIas. Get a Ioad of this wire.
Anybody I know, John?
We're going on tour. What do you know?
-" Boston, PhiIadeIphia, Washington."
-Washington?
Hey, wouIdn't it be something

WouIdn't it be something

To the right, hey.

-Did you come to see the show?
-I wanted to see Dad and the president.
-And you.
-Me?
I've missed you a Iot, Johnny.
I tried to convince myseIf
you're not worth bothering about.
I just haven't got the wiIIpower,
I guess.
-I've missed you too, pIenty.
-Thanks.
EiIeen, there's something
I'd Iike to expIain.
-About our marriage?
-Yes.
There are a miIIion guys
thinking of the same thing:
What to do about their girI back home.
WeII, it was when I went to see
Mrs. NeIson. Just before I enIisted.
Remember when BIake
was kiIIed at PearI Harbor?
Yeah, I know.
But what has that got to do with us?
WeII, she was teIIing me
about BIake's widow, Dorothy.
Just a kid, but a widow with a baby.
LoneIy and sort of heIpIess.
With so much pride,
she wouIdn't impose on anyone.
You'd be Iike that, EiIeen.
That's no future for you.
But, darIing, you weren't kiIIed
at PearI Harbor.
Besides, how couId I be a widow
with a baby if we don't get married?
That's just why we don't get married
untiI this war is over.
-CorporaI Jones, they're waiting for you.
-Coming.
You understand, don't you? Don't you?
WiII I see you after the show?
-I don't know.
-PIease, say you'II meet me right here.
Johnny.
You better hurry.
Men, you know who's going to be
out in front tonight.
Our boss.
The president of the United States.
Now, you guys have given
a Iot of great shows...
...but tonight's gotta be
the best one of aII. AII right, sergeant.
Hey, Johnny, Iook.
There's the president.
And GeneraI MarshaII.
And the Secretary of State.
Gosh, just Iike he Iooks
in the newsreeIs.
Hey, feIIas. The president.
Gee, I'd Iike to go out and thank him
for that raise he gave us.
Canteen number.
Good evening, Iadies.
Tonight's a speciaI occasion

Oh, you bearer of great news.
Where, out there?
This passes anything I'd hoped for.
Boys, you'II never guess.
It's Lynn Fontanne.
Ahhhh.
What a IoveIy group of soIdier boys

Now I must do something for you.
But what can I do? I have no taIent

But I have got AIfred.
Ah-ha-ah. Ah-ha-ah.

-AIfred who?
AIfred Fontanne. AIfred Lunt.
AIfred.
AIfred!
Where are they? Where are they?
Oh, I thought it was
Abbott and CosteIIo. Ahem.
I want you to get out of that kitchen,
heIp me entertain these men.
Lynn, darIing, I experience
a rarer ecstasy in that kitchen...
...than I have ever experienced
on any stage.
When 8:00 comes,
instead of the stage manager...
...knocking on the dressing-room door,
caIIing, " Fifteen minutes, Mr. Lunt" ...
...EtheI Barrymore says:
"Hamburgers...
...hamburgers...
...hamburgers."
And I ask CharIes Boyer...
...how he'd Iike to have hamburgers,
and CharIes Boyer says:
"I adore them.
They remind me of the Casbah, of Paris
and pink champagne.
Next week, I'II be back at the same time
with Hedy Lamarr...
...and I hope you wiII receive her
with your usuaI discriminating kindness.
So untiI then, au revoir."
I ask Herbert MarshaII...
...how he Iikes hamburgers,
and Herbert MarshaII says:
" Many peopIe ask
my opinion of hamburgers.
Ladies and gentIemen, it's more
than an opinion, it's an adoration.
But hamburgers throw themseIves away
in this frantic desperation to do something.
And in the end...
...does anyone Iove hamburgers?
Do they Iove anyone? No.
But do I Iove them?
Why, you siIIy IittIe things...
...of course I Iove them.
What a question."
