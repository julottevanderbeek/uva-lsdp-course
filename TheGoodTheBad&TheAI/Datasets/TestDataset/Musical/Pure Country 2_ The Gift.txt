What have you got there, Matthew?
I got speed, Joseph. I got speed.
Speed, huh?
Afraid we don't have much use
for more speed these days.
Things are moving fast enough down there
as it is.
Well, but the...
- Get it.
- Damn. Oh, I shouldn't have said...
I got it. Oh, fast little bugger.
I didn't mean to say "bugger" either.
- Well, put it on the shelf.
- Could we just toss it down and see if...?
- Speed is gonna have to wait.
- Could I just put it right there?
VOICE:
Wow.
JOSEPH:
What have you got there, Pedro?
Uh, it's a voice.
That's a big voice.
- Oh, yeah.
- Very big voice.
And soft and sweet as any aria...
...but strong and powerful
as anything before.
Can we send that one down?
Send it right down.
- Easy, easy. Matthew.
- I'm sorry. He's listening.
That voice is an incredible gift.
And with a great gift
comes great responsibilities.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
What?
There are rules that must be followed.
Oh, the rules, the rules.
- Yeah.
- Rules, rules. Um, um...
Never lie.
Always be fair.
Never break a promise.
Yeah.
Those are tough.
Well, wanna drop one?
Ugh, to those who much is given,
much is expected from them.
Him.
Well, it's time.
Let her rip.
Dream big, reach high
Don't ever be afraid
Just spread your wings and fly
With a heart full of faith
A whole lot of luck
And some love to see you through
Dream big and it just might come true
CHOIR :
Dream big, reach high
Don't ever be afraid
Just spread your wings and fly
With a heart full of faith, a whole lot of luck
And some love to see you through
Dream big and it just might come true
Dream big, reach high
Don't ever be afraid
Just fly, fly, fly
With a heart full of faith, a whole lot of luck
And love to see you through
Dream big and it just might come true
Dream big
Reach high
Dream big, reach high
Don't ever be afraid
Just spread your wings and fly
With a heart full of faith, a whole lot of luck
And love to see you through
Dream big and it just might come
True
Hallelujah. Yeah.
- Something wrong?
- No.
Billy Connelly is a big fat idiot.
Bobbie, be fair, never lie...
...never break a promise.
- Never break a promise.
But he said I was too poor
to have a mommy...
...that my daddy didn't want me.
Oh.
Honey...
...I told you, your mommy's in heaven.
But what about my daddy? Where is he?
Well...
...you're old enough to know now,
so I'll tell you the whole story.
Your daddy was a rodeo cowboy.
He rode into town on a big, white horse.
He had a smile that could make
the sun come out...
...and eyes that could calm a wild mare.
He met your mother
and there were fireworks.
They had a beautiful,
wonderful love affair.
And then the rodeo moved on.
So he climbed back up
on his big, white horse...
...and he rode out of town.
And that's it.
Your daddy was a rodeo cowboy.
Wow. A rodeo cowboy.
You left me for her
She left you for him
Now you're back again, begging
Saying it was a moment of weakness
Couldn't help falling
But now your love for me is rock solid
If your love was a rock
I'd throw it through the window
Skip it 'cross the water
Watch it sink to the bottom
I'd crush it with a hammer
Then glue it back together
Just to roll it down the mountain
Hope it never stops
If your love was a rock
You know it's true
That's what I'd do
Thank you all very much.
Now get ready for some hard riding...
...as we welcome you to
the 25th annual Cloverton Rodeo.
ANNOUNCER : Give a big round
of applause to Bobbie Thomas and her band.
You all right?
- Yeah.
- Heh.
Thanks.
I really enjoyed your singing.
ANNOUNCER :
Ladies and gentlemen...
...welcome to the annual
Cloverton Rodeo and Stampede.
Thanks.
WESTON:
Bobbie, I am so very sorry.
I'm not sure what happened.
Listen, I'm just glad you ain't hurt. Heh.
You ain't hurt, are you?
Bobbie?
Hey, you all right?
Honey, did you hit your head?
Do you like my singing, Wes?
Of course. Yeah, yeah, I love it.
I think you sing as good as the people
that sing in the Grand Ole Opry.
Uh, better.
ANNOUNCER : Let's give
a warm welcome to the Cloverton flag girls.
About tonight,
you should wear something special.
Special? For what?
Well, because it's gonna be
a real special night for us.
Oh, my God.
Ella?
- Ella.
- What are you screaming about, child?
At least I stay home when I look like this.
What happened to you?
Ella, I have a problem.
Yes, you do, child. Come here.
- What do you think of Wes?
- That he's a nice boy.
Do you think I should marry him?
- Did he ask you?
- No.
But I think he's going to.
- Tonight.
- Do you love him?
I don't know.
He's the best catch in this little town.
Except for...
- Do you believe in love at first sight?
- I believe in everything.
But how do you know
when you're in love?
- What's it feel like?
- Oh, that's easy.
When you're in love...
...it's like the sun rises and sets
on that person's smile.
They can make you fly higher
than you've ever soared...
...and sink lower than you've ever sunk.
You feel like you don't know
what you're doing half the time...
...but you know exactly what's going on
the other half.
It's the most beautiful feeling
in the world.
It's like taking a bath
in warm tapioca pudding.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Have you ever been in love?
Nope. Never took a bath
in pudding either.
Now go take a shower.
Gee, thanks.
- Hello, Weston.
- Hello, Ella.
Uh, ma'am.
ELLA:
Huh.
- Don't you look fine tonight.
- Oh, well, thanks. Heh, heh.
Do I?
Well, come on inside.
Bobbie's almost ready.
Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Um...
You're welcome.
Well, just have a seat here.
She'll be down in just a bit.
- Can I get you anything to drink?
- Nope. No, thank you.
How about a napkin?
I'm sorry?
Uh, oh, oh. No, thank you.
I'm just a little excited tonight.
Not excited, you know, but anxious.
Anxious.
- I'll get you that napkin.
- Okay.
Poor child.
Okay, I'm ready.
Hey. Heh, heh.
- You all right?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.
- Wow. You look great.
- Thank you.
Yeah, sure.
- Here's your napkin.
- Napkin? For what?
Uh, nothing, ha. You ready?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Thanks, Ella. Ma'am.
Close your eyes.
Step down.
BOBBIE: Why are your hands all wet?
- Shh, shh. Just a little bit further.
- You sure you can't see?
- I'm sure.
WESTON: Okay, step down.
Just keep going. There you go.
This needs to be perfect.
BOBBIE: Where are we going?
- Shh, shh. Just a couple more steps.
There you go. One more.
Okay, here we go. All right. Now face me.
- Don't peek, okay?
- I'm not peeking.
Okay, you can open your eyes now.
Isn't she perfect?
- A pickup truck?
- Yeah.
No. Not just a pickup truck.
I mean, it's a automatic, four-wheel drive.
It's perfect.
- That's what this is about?
- Oh, yeah.
- Our special night?
- Yes. Yeah. Yeah, why?
What did you think? Ha.
I mean, look at it, it's gorgeous.
Yeah, she's beautiful. Oh, man.
Yeah, l... Wait, wait. Bobbie?
- Where are you going?
- A pickup truck.
That's what was so important.
He bought himself a pickup truck.
I'm out of here.
WESTON: Bobbie?
BOBBIE: Tell him to go away.
I can't believe this. What an idiot I am.
A pickup truck.
I can't believe I lasted as long as I did in this
dumpy, little, nothing-happening, old town.
- Going somewhere?
- Yes.
I'm going to Nashville, Tennessee...
...and I'm gonna be a huge
country music star.
I been singing my whole life...
...time to see if I'm any good at it.
Because I've had it
with this stupid little town...
...and all these stupid little people in it.
Except for you, of course.
Of course.
How will you live?
I have saved $237.50.
Bus fare is only 87 bucks.
I'll get a job when I get there.
Waiting tables or something.
Done it my whole life.
I'll be fine.
I just feel like
I'm meant for something else.
Something bigger.
And it's not here in this little town...
...working at the diner...
...playing rodeo gigs on the back
of some stupid, old hay wagon.
Ella, do you think
people will like my singing?
I do.
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you too, baby.
Now, just because you're going to
a big city, don't you forget the rules.
- Never lie.
- Always be fair.
And never break a promise.
I love you.
Here.
I have something for you.
- It's beautiful.
- Open it.
It belonged to your mother.
What's this?
That is a reminder.
No matter what happens,
however tough life may get out there...
...remember, you can always come home.
Thank you.
Bye.
Here we go.
Hey, hey, hey, that's all right.
Hey. Hey, what's your name?
Hey, come on, talk to me.
Oh, man.
Jesus.
Don't ever be afraid
Spread your wings and fly
With a heart full of faith
A whole lot of luck
And some love to see you through
Dream big
It just might come...
Good morning.
Good morning.
Oh, God.
No, just one of his many workers.
I'm sorry. I just needed a place to sleep.
I'll leave right now.
- You new in town?
- Uh, yeah. I just got here last night.
I haven't found a place to stay yet
but I'm sure I'll find one today.
It's just different than I thought.
You, um, gonna drag those around
with you all day?
I have to. I don't have anywhere else
to put them.
If you like, I'll keep your bags here.
You can come get them
when you find a place to stay.
That would be a big help. Thank you.
- Here you go.
- Hey, great.
Let's see here.
BOBBIE:
I actually just got to Nashville yesterday.
I started with my Aunt Ella at Jake's Diner
just about the day I started walking.
That's right around the corner
from my house.
When I got out of school,
I started working full-time...
...but I had learned
the whole restaurant business...
...by the time I was 8 years old anyway,
so it wasn't that exciting for me.
But that's not
what I wanted to do with life...
...so I thought I'd come to Nashville
and I try my luck as...
A singer?
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- Just a hunch.
I don't have an address
or a phone number...
...because I just got here, you know?
Yeah, um...
Why don't you give us a call back,
like, when you get a phone.
Should I come back tomorrow?
We'll see what happens.
Oh.
Okay.
Thank you.
Can I get you anything else, hon?
Just some more water, please.
- You new in town?
- Mm-hm.
- You a singer?
- Yeah.
Me too.
Only don't tell the manager. He only wants
professional waitresses working here.
You get a lot of bigwigs in here.
He doesn't want people bothering them
and giving them music...
...and stuff like that. You know.
Uh-huh.
How long you been working here?
A while.
But as soon as I get my record deal,
I'm gone.
- Hi!
- Hi!
Hey.
Hey.
- Can I help you?
- Yes.
I saw the sign outside, "waitress wanted,"
and I'd like to apply.
You're a very beautiful girl.
Wonderful and pretty.
Well, thank you very much.
Does that mean I get the job?
Ha-ha-ha. Good sense of humor.
No.
First, ask questions.
- Name?
- Bobbie Thomas.
Good grip.
My name Morita, owner Sushi House.
- Nice to meet you, Morita.
- Pleasure mine.
- You have experience?
- Yes.
Twelve years at Jake's Diner
in Cloverton, Kentucky...
...where I been working
since I was this high.
- Because it was right around the corner...
- Plenty, plenty. Good, good, good.
Very pretty.
- Look like movie star.
- Thank you.
So...
...are you a singer?
Nope.
Oh, no. She lied.
What's all this about?
- She lied.
- Yeah, I know. I heard.
That's one.
It's so sad when they lie.
Oh, now don't cry.
You'll cause a flood down there.
He takes it so personally.
Okay, you get job.
But I run business here.
Need people to work at business,
not music.
Must be serious about sushi.
Can you start now?
- Sure.
- Congratulations.
Thank you.
MORITA:
Where all that rain come from?
- Raw fish?
- Hai.
- People eat this?
- Hai.
Sushi very good.
Hey, how long you been singer?
Well, my whole... Uh...
Hey, they're waiting for sushi.
Excuse me.
Raw fish and hot wine.
Everything okay, Mr. Haskins?
Morita, if it were any better,
I wouldn't able to stand it.
- Say, who's the new acquisition?
- Her name Bobbie.
- First night tonight.
- She's a beautiful young lady.
Hai. And very good worker.
BOBBIE: Thank you.
- No problem.
Bobbie, very good job tonight.
- You good worker.
- Thank you.
- Jimi.
- Hai.
Please, make some sushi
for our new worker.
- Hai.
- Oh, no, no.
You don't have to do that.
In Japan...
...you no accept gift, must kill you.
Morita make joke.
You should know what sushi taste like
if you sell.
Hai. Good night.
Good night.
Don't we have a hamburger
or something?
What?
No, it's a sushi house. We make sushi.
Try it. It's cool.
- What happened to your accent?
- Oh, that's our sushi accent.
It's okay, just use your hands.
Not bad.
- Here's a song.
- A song?
You're a singer, right?
Uh, well...
- You're a band?
- We, are:
The Rising Sons.
I thought Morita only wanted
professional restaurant people.
No musicians?
Well, that's gonna be a bit tricky...
...considering everyone in Nashville's
a musician.
- You ready?
- Ready for what?
- To sing.
- Sing?
Here we go, fellas.
One, two, three, four.
The country smells like
Flowers in the spring
The city smells like urine
Oh, but here's the thing
Sometimes I'm hard to understand
That's hard to take
But if you'd simply take my hand
You'd love me anyway
You can love me anyway
Ha-ha-ha.
That's great. You guys are wonderful.
- Wow.
- Miss Bobbie, you sing like an angel.
- Thank you.
- So what do you think of my song?
- You wrote it.
- Yep.
Well, the music is great.
Yes. See, guys. I told you.
But the lyrics could use some work.
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.
It's okay, man.
The country smells like
Flowers in the spring
If I'm...
If I'm just a girl
Would you love me?
Just one against the world
Would you love me?
If I can't be like everybody else
So I walk away from a dream
I never even wanted for myself
Would you love me anyway?
If I'm not strong enough
Would you love me?
And if I need you too much
Would you love me?
If I run to you when I wanna cry
When I'm gonna break
And you can't understand why
Would you love me anyway?
Would you love me anyway?
Baby, I need to hear you say
That you know me, you really know me
And you love me anyway
If I want to fly
Would you love me?
And hold me while I try
Because you love me?
If I wish to live among the stars
Where I can touch God's face
Would you let me go that far
And love me anyway?
Would you love me anyway?
Would you love me anyway?
Baby, I need to hear you say
That you love me anyway
Ooh
That's beautiful.
Hai, very beautiful song.
Jimi, pour some sake for everyone.
- Morita, I can explain...
- Jimi.
Pour sake.
I would like to propose a toast...
...to Bobbie Thomas
and the Rising Sons.
- How'd you know about the Rising Sons?
- It is my job to know everything.
That is why
I will become manager of the band.
You will all become very famous...
...and I will drive a Cadillac.
Would you love me anyway?
Solo the vocals for me.
That you love me anyway
Put this on tape for me, Lester.
Janie, how you doing, darling?
It's Keith Haskins.
Yeah. Is the grouch around?
Hey, Charlie, how you doing,
old buddy?
Yeah, well, I only called you because you're
close and I won't have to get in my car.
Now, I've got something you need
to do yourself a favor and listen to.
No, no, no, not tomorrow.
Tomorrow it'll be on the radio.
Now, this company is hot right now.
It would be a great place
for you guys to be.
BOBBIE:
Yeah!
Now, I've known the old man
for a long time, so he trusts me.
Now, let me do all the talking
when we're in there, all right?
Man, I hate this alley.
Always smells like urine.
JIMI:
My lyrics, exactly. See, guys. I told you.
PUDGE:
Your lyrics stink worse than the alley.
ISHI: You got it right, dude.
JIMI: Not true.
I write very powerful lyrics.
- Charlie?
- Yeah?
I want you to meet Bobbie Thomas.
Oh, the little girl with the big voice.
Welcome to
the Bobcat Entertainment Company.
Keith, we'll finally see
what kind of manager you are.
Hey, good of you to come.
Gotta run. Thank you.
What just happened in there?
What just happened in there
is I just got you your first record deal.
The train is pulling out and you are on it.
Let's celebrate, you all.
Morita, Sushi House?
Hai. Drinks on the house.
Guys, guys, guys,
I need to talk to Bobbie...
...so, uh, we'll meet you there later.
ISHI: Cool, man.
Let's go, kid. This train is rolling.
When you're ready
for some T-shirts, hats...
...Good Old Boy Merchandise.
That's the place you go.
- We'll call you.
- Keith's a very good guy, by the way.
He'll make you a really good manager.
I thought Mr. Morita was our manager.
Bobbie, Mr. Morita is
a good restaurant manager...
...not a manager of talent.
This is a whole different world.
But he brought us to you,
made the whole thing happen.
He gave me a job
when I really needed it.
It isn't fair.
Now, don't you worry about Morita.
He's being well taken care of.
All right, great. We'll see you then.
MAN: Hey, Keith.
- Hey, buddy, how you doing?
MAN:
Great.
I'd introduce you
but I don't remember his name.
Can't be that important, huh?
- Does that cell call long distance?
- Absolutely.
- You wanna call?
- Could I?
Sure. Dial away.
- Hello?
- Aunt Ella, it's me.
I know it's you, child.
No one else would call me at this hour.
It's good to hear your voice.
It's good to hear you too.
Sometimes I get so homesick,
I can hardly stand it.
You can always come home.
I know, but I'm doing pretty good now.
I got a job serving sushi and I met
some guys at work who have a band.
We wrote a song together
about my daddy...
...then Mr. Morita,
who owns the Sushi House...
...and knows everyone in the business,
introduced us to Mr. Haskins...
...who's, like, a really important manager,
and he introduced us to Mr. Bunch...
...who signed us to a recording contract
at Bobcat Entertainment...
...and we're gonna cut a record.
- What do you think?
- I think you need to take a breath.
Heh, I guess I'm just a little excited.
- Your phone's beeping.
- Oh, it's another call.
- Call waiting.
- I gotta go. He's got another call.
- I love you, Ella.
- I love you too, darling.
- Remember, be fair, and...
- Never break a promise, I know.
- Bye, darling.
- Bye.
Hello?
Ha-ha-ha. How you doing, buddy? All right.
I'm good, I'm good.
What about "never tell a lie"?
What?
Well, yeah. Yeah, I've been waiting.
- Leon, how you doing, buddy?
- Good. How are you?
Bobbie, say hi to Leon.
He's your new lawyer.
- Bobbie, Leon. How are you?
- Hi.
- Good to meet you.
- I never had a lawyer before.
Boy, you got one now.
Why don't you two step into the vocal booth
where you can hear yourselves think?
Hey, Charlie.
- You get her John Henry on the contract?
- Leon's doing it right now.
- How's the band?
- Amateur night in Dixie.
Sorry looking bunch. Get rid of them.
They're not the right image.
She's not gonna like it.
CHARLIE: This little girl is gonna be
the home run hitter...
...if we don't screw it up.
Get her a hot band.
Pam, send Tony down
with 2,000 in 20s. For Keith.
All right, you're the hotshot manager.
You make her happy.
LEON:
I can't wait till you're on the road.
It's a pleasure.
- Glad to represent you.
- Thank you.
- How you're doing, darling?
- Great. I think.
Things seem to be happening so fast.
Bobbie, this is your very first lesson
in becoming a star.
Making difficult decisions.
And you gotta make one right now.
There's a problem with the band.
What kind of problem? I'll talk to them.
Unfortunately, that won't help.
Truth is, they're just not very good.
We're gonna have to replace them.
But they can get better.
They'll work. I know these guys.
They'll work.
Darling, I would love to be able
to dunk a basketball...
...but no matter how hard I work,
it ain't ever gonna happen.
But it's not fair.
I wouldn't be here without them.
Kid, I'm sorry.
That's the way it's gotta be.
You are the real talent here.
This isn't charity work.
This is the big time.
I know, but maybe we can...
- Hey, is this a bad time?
- No, not at all. Come on in.
Bobbie, Tony, your accountant.
- Hi.
- Brought you a small advance.
- What's this?
- That is just a tiny advance on the money...
...this company knows you're gonna make.
- Shut the front door.
Sign here.
- Thanks. Nice to meet you, Bobbie.
- Nice to meet you, too.
- It isn't fair.
- This is business.
It isn't about being fair.
Are you in?
Yeah, I'm in.
- Uh-oh. That's two.
- Yes, that's two.
Just one left.
JOSEPH:
Why are we walking? We can fly.
BOBBIE :
Would you love me anyway?
Baby, I need to hear you say
That you know me
You really know me
And you love me anyway
HASKINS:
Why does it need to be a real cowboy?
Because a real cowboy walks, talks,
feels real.
Some model is not gonna be real.
That's ridiculous.
This whole world is an illusion.
Nothing I do is real.
She is.
She's absolutely the real deal.
BOBBIE:
Hey, what about this one?
Let's see.
- He's handsome enough.
- I like him.
- He looks like the real thing.
- Who is he?
Just some cowboy,
rides the rodeo circuit.
A rodeo cowboy.
Perfect.
WOMAN:
Dale, someone's on the phone for you.
- Is it the bank?
- Nope. Some production company.
- Production company?
- Mm-hm.
- What do they want?
- Why don't you talk to them and find out?
- Why don't you not sass me, booper?
- I have to. I'm your sister. It's my job.
- Sure it ain't the bank?
- I'm sure.
- You think it's the bank, Rog?
- Yes.
- Go answer the phone.
- Okay.
I need me a good bull this weekend.
Hello?
Yeah, this is he.
A video?
Yeah. And what would I have to do?
Ride a horse, wear a hat and smile.
Hell, I can do that.
But how much does it pay?
One thousand dollars?
Two thousand dollars?
You gotta be kidding me.
Three thousand dollars?
Shut the front door.
You know who you're talking to?
This is Dale Jordan, the bull rider.
Okay.
Yes, sir.
You got yourself a deal.
You're a hell of a good
negotiator too, sir.
Yes.
See you Monday.
Five thousand dollars.
Excuse me, sir.
I'm Dale Jordan.
Think I'm supposed to be in this deal.
Oh, yeah, the cowboy.
They were just looking for you.
You're in dressing room number two.
Park right next to the dressing room.
Then I think they wanna see you
in the makeup trailer.
Makeup trailer?
Here we go.
What is that stuff you're stirring?
This, my darling, is a special elixir that is
going to have you sparkling like a diamond.
It is my very own personal discovery
of brilliant vitamins and minerals...
...that when applied
to your facial epidermis...
...will make your skin come alive and
dance like angels in front of the camera.
- You're gonna put that on my face?
- No, no, no.
I'm going to paint it, like Picasso.
Now close your eyes.
Come on. Close your eyes.
First, I'm going to take care...
...of this little mustache that's growing
that we're going to...
Mr. Jordan.
Hi. They're ready for you over in Makeup.
I'm just gonna let this set that
right there.
Wait, wait, wait.
Uh, um...
They sent me here for, uh, like, makeup
or something.
- Oh, oh. The cowboy. Yes, of course.
- Yeah.
All right. Come in, please. Sit down.
- I'll be right with you, all right?
- Okay.
Um, excuse me, one second.
- Hello, are you all right?
- No. I look like an alien pig.
And he saw me.
Oh, come on. Don't be so vain.
You have to come out so I can finish.
I'm not coming out there while he's here.
You know what?
I think we can do you right now.
Hey, I don't want you to put
that white stuff on my face.
Oh, oh. Heaven's no.
With you it's just a matter of a puff there
and a little puff over here.
All right?
I saw that smile.
You can smile, you know.
It's just different for me, okay?
Have a little brush-brush here
and a brush-brush there.
Okay, here we are, here we are.
Just let me take one look.
You're all done. Okay?
Thank you.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
- Is he gone?
- Yes, Miss Vain, he's gone.
You can safely emerge
from your place of hiding.
What's wrong with my face?
What's wrong with your face?
Nothing's wrong.
You have a beautiful face.
Then why'd you put all this gunk
on my face? You didn't put any on him.
Because, my dear, you are the star.
We can't trust what we can't see
We're not strong enough to fight
When we feel weak
We can't resist another flame
We're not able to live above the blame
But love is
Love is
It's always been
It always will be
We may not be perfect
But love is
We may not be written
Anywhere close to the stars
But wherever we are
Love is
