I toot my flute,
I don't give a hoot
I've had no chance
to sing and dance
'Cause work and play
don't mix
Time to play,
time to play
You can play
and laugh and fiddle
Don't think
you can make me sore
I'll be safe,
and you'll be sorry
When the wolf
comes through your door
Who's afraid
of the Big Bad Wolf
Big Bad Wolf,
Big Bad Wolf
Who's afraid
of the Big Bad Wolf
Who's afraid
of the Big Bad Wolf
Big Bad Wolf,
Big Bad Wolf
Who's afraid
of the Big Bad Wolf
We'll put him
on the spot
Who's afraid
of the Big Bad Wolf
Big Bad Wolf,
Big Bad Wolf
Who's afraid
of the Big Bad Wolf
Open the door
and let me in!
Not by the hair
of my chinny chin chin!
I'll huff,
and I'll puff...
and I'll blow your house in!
Grr!
Curses!
Well, they're too smart for me.
Guess I'll go home.
He's gone.
Who's afraid
of the Big Bad Wolf
Big Bad Wolf,
Big Bad Wolf
Who's afraid
of the Big Bad Wolf
Who's afraid
of the Big Bad Wolf
Big Bad Wolf,
Big Bad Wolf
Who's afraid
of the Big Bad Wolf
Who's there?
I'm a poor little sheep
with no place to sleep.
Please open the door
and let me in.
Not by the hair
of our chinny chin chin!
You can't fool us
with that old sheep skin.
Raah!
I'll huff, and I'll puff...
and I'll blow your house in!
See? l told you
what would happen...
when that big wolf
came around.
Only bricks and stones
are wolf-proof.
Now, at last,
you're safe and sound.
Who's afraid
of the Big Bad Wolf
Big Bad Wolf,
Big Bad Wolf
Who's afraid
of the Big Bad Wolf
Who's there?
I'm the Fuller Brush man.
I'm working me way
through college.
Thank you.
Now I got you!
Ow!
Ouch!
Grr! Why--
By the hair
on your chinny chin chin...
I'll huff, and I'll puff,
and I'll blow your house in!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh!
Aah!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow-whoo!
Ow-whoo!
Who's afraid
of the Big Bad Wolf
Big Bad Wolf,
Big Bad Wolf
Who's afraid
of the Big Bad Wolf
