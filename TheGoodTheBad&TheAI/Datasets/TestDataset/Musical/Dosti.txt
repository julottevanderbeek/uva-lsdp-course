When will that happen in our country?
Lt will happen. But by that time
we will be old
We will get the money for sure
From where? Who will give it to us?
- The princess
They are wealthy people. 50-60 rupees

That's why you believed them too
I am sorry. You have been through a lot
Let him go. Please forgive him today
Learn something from him. You don't

To get on the records, you have
to get better marks. You have to study harder
He will. He will work very hard
You know at the test time what
problems he got into
Now he will make up for everything
