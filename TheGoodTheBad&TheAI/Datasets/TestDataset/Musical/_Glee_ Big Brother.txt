So here's what
you missed on Glee:
Sue's pregnant,
which is crazy...
I had my eggs frozen
in the late '70s.
...and she won't say
who the father is,
Rachel and Finn
decided to get married
after Regionals,
where the New Directions
beat Sebastian and the Warblers
and a madrigal group
that just sort of made
everyone uncomfortable.
And Sebastian made up with
Blaine after he realized
life's too short to blind
people with rock salt.
Quinn thought Rachel and Finn
were too young to get married,
and refused to go
to the wedding.
...which makes me really sad,
because I would have loved
to have seen you in
a bridesmaid's dress, Quinn.
...but then changed her mind
and started texting
while she raced
to the courthouse,
And that's what
you missed on Glee!
So do you think if Quinn
hadn't gotten into her accident,
we still would've gone
through with the wedding?
Yeah, totally.
Totally. I mean,
I'm kind of glad we're waiting.
Now it doesn't have to be
a Justice of the Peace quickie.
Hey, I was thinking
since Nationals
are in Chicago this year,
we-we should have the wedding
someplace special.
Like-like on the pitcher's mound
of Wrigley Field.
O-Or someplace else.
It's not that, it's Quinn.
I can't stop thinking
about her. She's...
Right behind you.
Hi, Quinn!
We missed you so much.
No, don't.
I could have easily become one
of those creepy memorial pages
in the yearbook, but by
the grace of God, I'm here.
Believe it or not...
this is the happiest
day of my life.
Come on, Artie.
I'll race you to the choir room.
You could never know
what it's like
Your blood like winter
freezes just like ice
And there's a cold lonely
light that shines from you
You'll wind up like
the wreck you hide
Behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool
could never win?
Well, look at me,
I'm coming back again
I got a taste of love
in a simple way
And if you need to know,
while I'm still standing
You just fade away
Don't you know
I'm still standing
Better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor
Feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing
After all this time
Picking up the pieces
of my life
Without you on my mind
I'm still standing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Once I never could
hope to win
You started down the road
leaving me again
The threats you made were
meant to cut me down
And if our love
was just a circus
You'd be a clown by now
Don't you know
I'm still standing
Better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor
Feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing
After all this time
Picking up the
pieces of my life
Without you on my mind
I'm still standing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh-oh...
I'm still standing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm still standing
I'm still standing,
I'm still standing.
Here's a lesson for
your board, Mr. Shue.
Don't text and drive. Ever.
It's the stupidest thing
I've ever done.
Besides sleeping with Puck.
There's a lot of rumors floating
around, so let's clear the air.
First of all, all my plumbing
still works, which is awesome.
But my spine was severely
compressed in the car accident,
which basically means
I can't move my feet or legs.
But the good thing is that
I'm starting to regain feeling,
so with a lot of physical
therapy, and your prayers,
I stand a good chance
for a full recovery.
So no tears.
That means you, Tina.
Oh, and I apologize
for the number.
My dance moves aren't
as smooth as Artie's yet.
With practice,
they will be.
I promise that by the time
we go to Nationals,
I'll be out of this chair,
and dancing on that stage.
All right.
Whoo!
I'm sorry, I...
I don't think I understand
what you just told me.
I said, I'm making
swim coach Roz Washington
co-coach of the Cheerios!
How can you do this to me?
ROZ:
I think I can answer
that question.
This Saturday the Cheerios!
had Regionals tournament.
You were 15 minutes late.
That's unacceptable.
I had a doctor's appointment.
Oh... I know.
The doctor had to shine
a flashlight in your va-jay-jay
to get all the bats to fly out.
I understand that keeping
bats out of your womb
is an important part of having a
baby when you're older than God.
But it is no way to win
a national championship.
Sue...
The lovely and talented
bronze medalist
Roz Washington has a point.
We need the money
and sponsorships that only
a national championship
can bring to the school,
and your condition is
compromising your work.
It's settled.
My word is law.
This will not stand!
Oh, it's gonna stand.
And you know what else
is gonna stand?
Your fully-grown, adult baby
when he pops out of your birth
canal, before he hurries off
to the high-powered law firm
where he has just made partner.
So take your Centrum Silver,
and your old ass,
and find a new dream.
What if I can guarantee you
a national championship?
And how will you do that?
The Glee Club.
If they win at Nationals,
the school wins
a $10,000 cash prize.
I get you that money,
I get to run the cheerleading
program alone!
Five, six, seven, eight!
Stop! Please, stop!
This is an embarrassment.
Hey, Mercedes.
Who you texting?
I'm not texting anyone,
I'm donating to
the Obama campaign...
My Droid!
Good news! I booked a tour at
the Railroad Museum on Friday,
which means we're gonna have
an awesome Senior's Ditch Day.
What is she doing here?
Hey, Granny Panties!
I'm taking over Booty Camp1
Why on earth do you
want to run Booty Camp?
Because, as I established, I
want to help you win Nationals.
And I am a champion
who can whip that squad
of pear-shaped teens into shape.
You're out of shape,
you're constantly late,
and when you're not
too busy texting,
you're complaining about
the choreography
you're too lazy to learn.
You're nothing but
a coven of tardy,
narcissistic, bloated
bags of cellulite
who will stab each other
in the back
at the first glimpse of a solo
in a competition hosted by
a late-night horror movie host.
Well, those days are over.
Sue?
We need to talk about what
happened at Booty Camp.
Oh, you mean my epic smack down
of the glee club over their
complete apathy and
lack of professionalism?
According to the kids,
you were typical abusive
belligerent self,
only more so.
I just got this
e-mail from Kurt.
"Mr. Shue, save us!
Coach Sue is meaner
than Tabatha!"
First of all,
I have absolutely no idea who
Porcelain is referring to.
I'm assuming it's gay and niche.
Secondly, based on
the pathetic display
I just saw?
Your glee club's back-to-back
victories were flukes.
Oh...
Against Vocal Adrenaline?
On the national stage?
You'll be like lambs
to the slaughter.
Why are you resisting
my help, William?
We should try to
inspire and encourage
our kids, Sue,
not humiliate and crush them.
I don't get it.
You were acting like you
had turned over a new leaf.
William... I'm near the end
of my first trimester.
I'm wildly hormonal, riding out
massive, unpredictable
mood swings.
Stop trying to
understand my actions.
Maybe you should
talk to your doctor
about adjusting your medication?
Oh, I'll ask.
I'm going there this week to
confirm the sex of my daughter.
Mm! Oh, Sue!
That's a mother-to-be
single most important doctor
visit. Who's going with you?
Same person who's going to
help me raise this child,
Barbara Gordon. No one.
We'll...
Sue, you can't go alone.
No, you need a friend there,
for moral support.
I agree.
We'll go with you.
You okay?
You seem a little preoccupied.
Oh, well, my brother's in town.
He's picking me up,
taking me out to lunch.
Blaine, that's exciting!
I finally get to meet this
mysterious brother of yours,
who you refuse to talk about.
I'm dying to know
what he looks like.
Oh, trust me, you...
you already know
what he looks like.
Blainie!
Hey, Coop!
Hey!
Hey.
How are you, bud?
Good. Good to see you, man.
This your,
this your boyfriend, here?
Actually, yes, it is.
Hi.
Kurt, this is my brother...
Nice to meet you.
...Cooper Anderson.
Oh, my God.
You're the guy from
the freecreditratingtoday.com
commercials!
Guilty as charged.
Know your score
Freecreditratingtoday.com
Slash savings!
I love those commercials!
The jingle's my ringtone!
Excuse me, I'm sorry
to interrupt, but, um,
I just needed to tell you
that I am an enormous
fan of your work.
Thank you.
Will you sign my breast?
My pleasure.
"Keep on dreaming.
"Yours...
Mine.
Cooper Anderson."
You do me a great honor.
And if Alan Menken isn't
personally writing you
a fairy tale musical
at this very moment,
I will hunt him down
and beat him senseless
with a cudgel.
Because you, sir,
are a Disney prince.
Wow.
God, it is great to be
back in the Midwest.
My commercial's on hiatus,
so I told my agent I was
headed back to the heartland
to press the flesh,
do some character research.
Next season's commercials have
a lot more intense, gritty
character stuff, so
I really want to explore
my salt-of-the-earth roots.
Blaine, your brother's
the best-looking man
in North America.
Um, Coop and I are gonna head...
Excuse me.
Gaston, if I could pull you
away from these ladies
for just a moment; I have
something I'd like to ask you.
Yeah. I mean, that's...
that's why I never really
talk about my brother.
+
PUCK:
We all know why we're here.
I've waited five years for this.
I want ideas for
Senior Ditch Day. Go.
Ooh! A Gershwin/Sondheim
scavenger hunt!
That sounds like torture.
We want actual ideas, Kurt.
How about a dance movie
marathon? Footloose...
What about a non-alcoholic
pub crawl?
It's Senior Ditch Day, not
Senior Citizen's Ditch Day.
It's springtime. I would like
to see something give birth.
Quinn, I'm so sorry.
It was my wedding
that you were going to
when you got into
your car crash, and...
you were answering
my text message, and now...
we're all sitting here,
and we're talking about
this day that's supposed to be
the most amazing
and unforgettable day
of our high school lives,
and we're-we're completely
ignoring the fact that
she's sitting in that chair?
It's not right.
It's not right,
and it shouldn't be like this.
Well, maybe not, but...
this is the way it is.
My accident, which you did
not cause, by the way,
does not define me
or ruin our senior year.
I meant what I said
in the choir room.
I'm not gonna dwell on this, and
neither should any of you, okay?
Come here.
Come on.
Come on.
Now, we are ditching as planned.
I think we should go
to Six Flags.
The Lady Fabray has chosen
wisely. Six Flags it is.
Meeting adjourned.
Hey!
Hey, Finn, can you hang back
for a sec?
The Apple guy.
The Facebook guy.
Abraham Lincoln.
What do these guys all have
in common with us?
I don't know.
They were all in a show choir?
None of 'em were
taken seriously in
high school, dude.
They were written off
by the world
until they got
the big idea.
Then bingo!
The rest is history.
Okay. So what's your big idea?
Lima's only got 22 pools.
Southern California has
I Googled it.
So after graduation,
I'm gonna move to L.A.
and expand my
pool cleaning business.
And I want you to be
my business partner.
With your brains
and my jaw line,
I'm telling you,
we'd kill it.
Wow, dude, I'm so honored
that you'd even consider me.
But you know, after we graduate,
I'm going to New York
with Rachel.
Okay. Let's say you weren't,
just 'cause maybe she doesn't
get into that fancy school
or you don't get married
right away.
We are. It's gonna happen.
Okay.
But, hey, could
you do me a favor?
Um, you know that
blonde on Sycamore Street
that likes to mow
her lawn in tube tops?
Yeah, Mrs. Tennison.
Yeah.
Well, her Jacuzzi's busted.
So, I thought since you know
so much about motors,
you could take a look at it.
Help me out.
Yeah. All right,
I could probably do that.
Lazy idiots, your leader
Will Schuester has informed me
that my teaching methods
are harsh and too extreme.
So I've decided to show you
what a real artist looks
and acts like.
Ladies and gays,
as my gift to you,
which you do not deserve,
I give you
Porcelain's famous brother...
Actually, it's my brother.
...Cooper Anderson.
Thank you, Sue.
Namaste.
Okay.
Guys, it was just a few years
ago that I was sitting
in a sad drab room like this
with dreams like yours
that I thought would
never come true.
But you know what?
They did.
So, tomorrow, at Sue's
insistence, I will be teaching
a Master class in acting
for anyone who's interested
in becoming successful
in the business like me.
Fantastic!
Cooper, we can't
thank you enough.
This is so generous of you to
share your time and expertise.
Well, it's very clear that
the Anderson brothers
are very talented,
and I'm sure that there were
many a family holiday
where the two of you
maybe did a little duet
by the piano?
Actually, it's funny that you
should mention that because
Blaine and I were famous
around the neighborhood.
Not famous.
We were pretty famous
around the neighborhood
for our dueling
Simon LeBon impressions.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Please don't make me do that.
Oh, no, Blaine,
you have to.
You're both so
handsome and good.
Come on, Blaine.
What do you say?
How about a little Duran Duran?
Is that okay?
Yeah.
Come on.
Okay, okay, okay.
You're on, Cooper.
Ooh, the cardigan's
coming off.
Whoo!
Darken the city,
night is a wire
Steam in the subway,
Earth is afire
Do, do, do-do-do, do-do-do
do-do-do, do-do-do, do, do
Woman, you want me,
give me a sign
And catch my breathing
even closer behind
Do, do, do-do-do, do-do-do
do-do-do, do-do-do, do, do
Her name is Rio and she dances
on the sand
Just like that river twisting
through a dusty land
And when she shines, she
really shows you all she can
Oh, Rio, oh, Rio, dance
across the Rio Grande
Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
:
Hungry like the wolf
Her name is Rio,
she don't need to understand
Yeah
Smell like I sound
And I might find her
if I'm looking like I can
Oh, Rio, oh, Rio, hear them
shout across the land
Mouth is alive
From mountains in the north
down to the Rio Grande
Her name is Rio,
she don't need to understand
From mountains in the north,
down to the Rio Grande
Burning the ground.
Standing O. Whoo!
Well...
I was really great
in that number.
+
Could I get
a wee bit of cheese with that?
What part of Scotland
are you from?
Ireland. We're the micks,
they're the macs.
I'll get you guys
some free Cokes.
Oh, cheers.
Bless you.
Why do you do that?
Service industry is a great
place to try out new accents.
Keeps your instrument
from getting rusty.
Use everything.
Will do.
So, nice job on
the song today.
Really nice.
Oh, thank you.
You were a little
pitchy on "Rio,"
and your moves lacked a theme,
though.
My theme was dancing,
I guess.
But you have to give in to it.
Stanislavsky says,
"The fingers are the eyes
of the body,"
but he never mentioned
that the toes are the ears.
You're unbelievable.
What do you mean?
What are you doing?
What?
All you ever do is tell me
what I'm doing wrong.
You waste no opportunity
to remind me
how much I suck
at, like, everything.
No, no. Come on, Blaine.
Your balance is
completely off.
I just learned to walk
three years ago.
If that happened, I'm so sorry.
But I don't,
I don't remember it.
Of course you don't.
Hey, hey, little brother,
I know there is an age
difference between us,
But I'd really want
to be closer to you.
I want to get to know you
a little better,
all right?
That's why I'm here.
Yeah. No, I would love that.
I'd like that.
Great! So you're gonna come
to my Master class tomorrow,
right?
Right?
Yeah, sure.
Great. Cheers.
The accent.
Top o' the morning.
Ready?
I don't know. It's super-steep.
In fact, it's the steepest
accessibility ramp in Lima.
I know.
I've conquered them all.
I think I'm just gonna go
to the front of the school.
That ramp is nice and gentle.
Quinn Fabray!
I believe in you.
Now come on.
Prove me right.
You can do this.
I'm not gonna make it.
You will!
My arms...
...are like iron! Come on!
You can do it!
...aren't strong like yours.
Yes, you are.
Lean forward and push.
: Ow.
Come on. You're halfway there.
You've got this!
Push! Push!
That sounds familiar.
It's just like
having a baby. Come on.
You wouldn't know!
Three,
BOTH:
Two...
one... zero.
You made it!
Whoo!
Oh, my God.
Whoo!
Now just stay
up there.
I would say that was one
of the hardest
things I've ever done.
Until you go
to Six Flags.
Look, I'm not trying
to be a buzzkill,
but going to an
amusement park
when you're in
a wheelchair--
especially if you're
still getting used to it--
can kind of
be a drag.
Artie, it's Senior Ditch Day.
It's the only Senior Ditch Day
I'm ever going to have.
I completely agree,
which is why I want you to come
with me on Friday.
I promise you,
it will be the most amazing,
incredible and inspiring
Ditch Day ever.
Whoo!
Welcome, guys, to the Cooper
Anderson Acting Master class.
Thank you. Yes.
Buckle your seat belts, kids,
buckle your seat belts
'cause I'm about
to pour you a tall glass of
"This is how it is."
First thing you're gonna
want to know:
Don't go to college.
It is a waste of time.
Number two:
Don't go to New York.
Theater is lame
and Broadway is dead.
Real actors do TV and film,
which means Hollywood
is where it's at.
Now let's talk headshots.
Always, without fail,
turn into a pose.
Again.
CLASS: Wow.
And again.
CLASS: Ooh...
And one more time.
CLASS: Oh, yeah!
Yes, that is a dynamic headshot,
and bam,
you just got your first
callback. So now you've got
your "sides."
Your foot's in the door.
What do you do next?
Gotta figure out,
is it comedic or is it dramatic?
Often, it's hard to tell, right?
So do what I do:
ask the director.
"Is this scene comedic
or dramatic?"
He will know you're an
actor who's not afraid
to ask the tough questions,
right?
Why are you writing this down?
Okay, what's the key
to a dramatic scene?
Finding the emotion.
Connecting
with your scene partner.
Oh, no, no and no.
The key to a dramatic scene
is pointing.
When people are
really emotional,
they point their fingers a lot.
That's not true
at all.
That's... that's
terrible advice.
Excuse me, guys, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Blaine.
Are you an internationally
beloved spokesman
for the Internet's fastest-
growing credit score Web site?
GIRL: No.
I didn't think so.
So let's focus in, okay?
I'm here for you.
I don't normally do this,
but because you're in brother's
class and you guys are so nice,
I'm gonna give you some
Level II stuff.
The secret to great acting,
ignoring whatever
the other actor is doing.
Eye contact with a scene partner
is incredibly distracting.
I try to tune them out entirely.
Sometimes I wear earplugs.
That way, I don't get distracted
by what
they're doing, and I can focus
on the awesome acting choices
I've planned ahead of time.
Like eating
a roast beef sandwich, right?
Other choices I can plan
ahead of time:
screaming all my lines!
Because I'm really intense.
And the things
I'm feeling are really intense!
Because I'm an intense actor!
Nicholas Cage, right?!
Yeah, yeah!
Whoo!
Bravo.
All right, guys, I don't want
you to go cray-cray,
but I brought in "sides--"
industry term--
from a little show that
I auditioned for last week...
What does that stand for?
Oh, my nana loves that show!
Now in this scene, Agent Sciuto
has just discovered a dead body.
Who knows what will unfold?
Don't look at each other.
Action.
Here's what we know.
Sergeant Pembroke
took a bullet
at point-blank range.
What we don't know
is why he's wearing a dress.
There's a rumor that Sergeant
Pembroke was a transvestite.
No, Blaine, say
the line again,
but this time,
point your finger.
Things are serious; a
man in a dress is dead.
I don't really
feel like pointing, Coop.
Just feels a little stupid.
Well, when a choice feels wrong,
it's actually a good sign.
It means you're right
on the edge, man.
See, I don't know about that.
I feel like when a choice...
Coop, you're my brother!
Can't you just support me?
I'm sorry, are you
talking to me right now?
Because I can't tell
if you're talking to me
if you don't
point your finger.
Right?
That is lesson number one,
guys, right?
Scene. Scene. Scene.
Good work, buddy.
We'll get 'em
next time.
Let's go! Whoo!
Let's move on
to a little acting exercise
that I like to call
The Emotion Tornado.
Get your hands
up to the sky...
Just a busted control
panel, Mrs. Tennison.
Nothing too serious.
You're a lifesaver.
Noah told me
you're going
into business together.
No, I said we were
thinking about it.
Well, I think it's a great idea.
And if you need any investors,
I'd love to be a
silent partner.
Or a noisy one.
In California,
she's considered ugly.
Dude, I'm not going to L.A.
Okay, end of discussion.
Let me just say this,
and I'll shut up forever.
If getting hitched
is a team effort,
why are you the one that's
always giving up everything?
Maybe it's time
for Rachel to start
thinking about you
for a change.
It's not like
you're asking her
to sacrifice her career.
You heard Blaine's
famous brother.
L.A. is where it's at.
Rachel could probably
get on TV,
play the quirky
next-door girl or whatever.
And you could
try acting, too.
Or go to college.
This could be your day job.
You spend so much time
thinking only about her.
Take a couple seconds
and think about yourself.
+
I can barely focus.
The thought of a boy
clinging to my insides
is making me even more nauseous.
Sue, maybe you should wait to
find out the sex of the baby.
Besides, boys aren't
so bad anyway.
They're disgusting.
They have terrible aim when
peeing, they're weak-minded,
and when will someone
give me a straight answer
as to why they have nipples?
Sue Sylvester.
Right this way, please.
I'm sorry,
is this the father?
Uh, no, no.
God, no.
Uh, these are...
these are my friends.
Mm-hmm.
Sounds so weird coming
out of my mouth.
Here for moral support?
Yes, exactly.
Anything you have to say to me,
you can say in front of them.
DOCTOR:
Okay.
Well, looking at
your test results,
your baby is a girl.
Yes!
Ah!
A girl!
Come on, now.
There we go.
Oh, my toilet
seats are spared.
However...
However?
Your amnio came back
with irregularities.
So, Coop, have you met
George Clooney?
Not yet.
But I have had sex
with the Progressive
Insurance lady.
Perfect.
Don't be a stranger,
all right?
Follow me on Twitter.
All right.
Tweet me.
Yeah!
Ask me why I am
so happy, Squirt.
Don't call me that.
My life just
completely changed.
I just got an audition
for a Michael Bay movie.
Oh, that's great.
Hello? Did you hear me?
Michael freakin' Bay.
The movie's untitled,
which you know is code
for Transformers 4.
You don't seem
very happy for me.
Oh, I'm thrilled.
Well, you got
a weird way of showing it.
It wouldn't
kill you to smile.
Also wouldn't kill you
to stop letting Kurt
pick out your clothes.
He d-does not.
Mm-hmm, could've fooled me.
Come on, man,
we'll have our own ditch day.
You can help me run lines.
It's all about
you, isn't it?
Well, you know what, big
brother, I'm sick of it.
And I'm not going
to take it anymore.
Huh.
After all
you put me through
You think I'd despise you
But in the end
I want to thank you
'Cause you made me
that much stronger
Well, I thought I knew you
Thinking that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust,
called your bluff
Time is up
'cause I've had enough
You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride
just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out
in shame, mm-hmm
After all of the stealing
and cheating
You probably think
that I hold resentment for you
But uh-uh,
no, no, no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all
that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how
capable I am to pull through
So I want to say thank you
'Cause it makes me
that much stronger
Makes me work
a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for
making me a fighter
Made me learn
a little bit faster
Made my skin
a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me
a fighter
How could this man
I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust
so cruel?
Could only see
the good in you
Pretended not to see
the truth
You tried to hide your lies,
disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end, you'll see
You won't stop me
I am a fighter and I
I ain't gonna stop
I ain't gonna stop
There ain't no turning back
I've had enough
Makes me work
a little bit harder
Oh
Makes me that much wiser
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Thanks for making me
a fighter
Fighter
Makes me that much stronger
Oh, oh
Makes me work
a little bit harder
Oh, yeah, yeah
Makes me that much wiser
Wiser
So thanks for making me
a fighter
Made me learn
a little bit faster
Made my skin
a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me
a fighter.
Oh! Dude, watch it!
Whoa, sorry.
My toes.
I'm sorry, man.
Hey.
What were you doing?
Uh, texting...
Texting while walking.
That's exactly
how I started.
Well, I don't usually
text while...
Think about it.
You know, luckily enough,
the guy that crashed into me
while I was texting is fine,
but, you know, I...
Okay.
You should really
not do that anymore.
No more texting, okay?
Well, unless
I'm in class
or, you know, on the toilet
or at a movie or something.
Thank you.
What's going on?
Oh, well,
that's funny you're here.
I was just, uh,
confirming the ditch day
amusement park ticket order...
Oh, count us out.
What? Why?
Because we have a super special
senior ditch day planned,
Artie Abrams style.
Isn't that right, Artie?
That's right.
+
Do you think just
because you stand there
quietly mouth breathing and
reeking from this morning's
maple-y toaster pastries that
you're not interrupting me?
What do you want, Jackson?
Spit it out.
I heard about your baby.
You did?
Yeah.
I heard you're having
a baby girl.
Yeah.
Just like you.
Come here.
Just like you.
Dang, Coach.
Don't start lactating.
Can I give you
a parenting tip?
Sure.
Try to work on your patience.
You gonna tell me
what we're doing here?
Just follow me.
It's up here.
What is this?
This is where we go to play
on Senior Ditch Day.
Or, as I like to call it,
CripSkip.
Artie! What's happening?!
'Sup, Mickey?
I don't think
I'm ready for this.
Yeah, you are.
Just trust me.
Oh, we up, up, up
for the glow show
Yeah, we down, down here
on the ground
Yeah, we up, up, up,
up above love
Yeah, we up, up, up
through the clouds
Yeah, we up, yeah, we up
Come on, come
on, come on.
You're gonna find a way-ay
Find a way-ay to be
You're gonna get yourself
aligned with your old man
You're gonna get it free
You're gonna
get it free, yeah
'Cause it's the way-ay-ay
now
Way-ay-ay to see
But it's inside and out
with no doubt
It's in everything,
it's in everything
Oh, we up, up, up
for the glow show
Yeah, we down, down here
on the ground
Yeah, we up, up, up,
up above love
Yeah, we up, up, up
through the clouds
Yeah, we up, yeah, we up
You're gonna
find your way-ay
Find your way-ay to be
Hey, you're gonna get yourself
aligned with your spine
And you'll get it free
You'll get it free
It's the way-ay-ay now
Way-ay-ay to see
Well, in the moment,
it comes and it goes
Yeah, it's in everything
It's in everything
We up, up, up
for the glow show
Yeah, we down, down here
on the ground
Yeah, we up, up, up,
up above love
Yeah, we up, up, up
through the clouds
Yeah, we up, yeah, we up
Yeah, we up,
yeah, we up
Whoo!
Whoo!
Yeah, we up, yeah, we up
Yeah, we up, yeah, we up
Whoo!
Thank you.
This was a really great
Senior Ditch Day.
You were right.
I just wanted you
to meet a cool
group of people
having a great time in
the same situation as you.
Yeah, but I'm not...
This is only temporary.
The doctor said
it's a matter of time before...
Look, I've been
where you are.
I know how it feels,
but you can't keep denying...
I'm not denying anything.
You're not me.
Okay?
I'm not like you.
This isn't my life.
I'm going to Yale,
I'm getting out of Lima,
and I'm going to walk again.
And what if you don't?
When are you going
to stop pretending
that this isn't really
happening to you?
+
No, no.
Maybe you should
request a lower locker.
Could be easier.
No. This has always
been my locker
and will continue to be
until I walk across that stage
in my cap and gown
and get my diploma.
I gotta get to class.
Can I walk with you?
I've been praying for you.
Well, guess it could help for
God to hear from a few people.
I've been praying to walk again,
as well.
Oh, I don't pray
for you to walk.
I ask God to help you accept
whatever your journey may be.
I appreciate your prayers--
I do--
but when you're done praying,
you get to get up off your knees
and walk away.
Sorry.
Self-obsessed bitch.
It's cool.
You know what...
you're really inspiring.
And I feel like you've
been inspiring to a
few other people I know.
What are you doing after school
today?
All right, fair warning:
in the glorious history of
Booty Camp,
this will be the toughest!
But first, Quinn's
got the floor.
I invited a friend to join us.
You met him on Valentine's Day.
Teen Jesus!
QUINN: He's got a killer voice.
Whoo!
Okay, all right.
Welcome to the New Directions.
Hey, dude, you have
a twig in your hair.
No, seriously.
WILL: Okay.
Thanks, bro.
Let's give our undivided
attention to Coach Sue.
First off, please don't ask me
which celebrity is the father
of my baby. Please.
I will release that information
once I've finalized my book
and movie deal.
Now, it has come to my attention
that I have been a tad
harsh with some of you.
I thought I was being kind.
For instance,
I said absolutely nothing
about the implausible
sexual tension
between Mercedes and the
Kentucky Fried Stripper.
Or the sorry fact that you
wasted untold millions
on a laser show for yourselves
just so Sandbags could dance
with the night school's
Polynesian janitor.
Actually, he was
Puerto Rican.
Kids, it's in my DNA
to be intense, okay,
just like it's in Porcelain's
DNA to poop rainbow glitter.
Now, I'll admit
I-I behaved badly.
I also realized something.
I am here
for two very important reasons.
Number one: Mr. Schuester needs
at least one adult friend.
And number two:
I am hoping that the miraculous
life growing inside of me
can soak up some of your
constantly annoying,
though admittedly laudable,
optimism and decency.
Now, I promise to be nicer
if you promise to work your
talented little butts off
until they hand you that
first-place trophy in Chicago.
All right, sloppy babies,
let's take it from the top.
Five, six, seven, eight!
Hello.
I'm Margaret Thatcher Dog.
My relationship with
the Queen was ruff!
Oh, look what Finn won
you playing skeeball.
Finn won this?
Yeah. Well, Rachel kept making
him win stuffed animals for her,
and at the end of the
day, out of the 14
she had, I confiscated this
little guy to give to you.
Since there
was no convincing
you coming with us.
I would've just
brought you guys down.
Look, I get it:
family stuff is hard,
especially between brothers.
I mean, Finn and I
are not even real brothers,
and we pretty much
disagree on everything,
but I love the big lug.
And at the end of the day,
we're in each other's corners.
You only get one
brother, Blaine.
Don't give up on that.
He's the one that's leaving.
Huge audition,
you didn't hear about it?
Actually, he hasn't left yet.
He's in the auditorium,
hoping that you'll come
and talk to him.
I've tried talking to him.
Doesn't... doesn't really
work with him.
Maybe talking is not the answer.
Maybe you need
to show him
how you really feel in the best,
most honest way you know how.
Now and then I think of
when we were together
Like when you said you felt
so happy, you could die
So when we found
that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would
still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad
it was over
But you didn't have
to cut me off
Make out like
it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even
need your love
But you treat me
like a stranger
And that feels so rough
No, you didn't have
to stoop so low
Have your friends
collect your records
And then change your number
Guess that
I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody
that I used to know
Now and then I think of all
the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was
always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna
live that way
Reading into every word
you say
You said that
you could let it go
And I wouldn't
catch you hung up
On somebody
that you used to know
But you didn't have
to cut me off
Make out like
it never happened
Oh...
And that we were nothing
And I don't even
need your love
But you treat me
like a stranger
And that feels so rough
Oh...
No, you didn't have
to stoop so low
Have your friends
collect your records
Oh...
And then change your number
Guess that
I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody
that I used to know
Somebody
That I used to know
Somebody
Now you're just somebody
that I used to know
Somebody
That I used to know
Somebody
Now you're just somedy
that I used to know
Ooh
I used to know
Somebody.
Best you've
ever sounded.
I am tough on you.
This week, maybe, a little
tougher than I should've been,
and I need to apologize
for that.
But it's only because I see--
I've always seen--
how insanely talented you are.
I want you to be as successful
as you can be, Blaine,
and you will be.
You're gonna do it all--
movies, concerts...
Broadway.
Even though it's dead?
You'll resurrect it.
And when I'm in the audience,
watching you,
I want to be able to say,
"That's my kid brother up there.
I helped him get there."
Thanks for saying that, Coop.
And I know you really
mean it, too, because
you weren't pointing
your finger at me or...
Okay, okay.
: speaking
really loudly
to be intense.
I'm really glad we
could sing together
one last time
before you left
to be Mr. Hollywood.
Actually, my audition
got canceled.
What?
I don't know.
Apparently, Michael Bay
just decided to go
in a different direction,
which is industry-speak
for "Thanks, but we found
somebody who's better
and/or hotter."
Okay, first of all,
y-you don't know that.
And second of all,
screw Optimus Prime.
Even though we don't live
in the same town,
and we don't see
each other all the time,
we're not just
brothers, right?
We're friends, too?
That's... exactly what I've
always wanted us to be, Coop.
Hold on a second.
I just, uh,
I want to remember
this emotion
so I can use it
in a scene someday.
You are ridiculous.
You never know, right?
Hey, I want to,
I want to help you.
I don't want you
to give up on this audition.
Come on, I got an idea.
Where are we going?
We are going to put you on tape
so Michael Bay can see
what real acting is.
Pointing.
Nice touch.
See, I believe that.
That's why it's
lesson number one.
Hey.
So how do you think I did
in Cooper's Master class?
You made it seem like you
discover dead bodies every day.
If that was a real part,
you would've got it.
So the NYADA scout
is gonna be hereoon.
I'm pretty sure
I'm ready for it.
Have you ever thought about
what I'm gonna do in New York?
Well, one thing I know
is for certain is, we'll
figure it out together.
Well, that's really nice,
but I... I feel like I need
to start thinking seriously
about what's next for me.
You ever thought
about California?
I just, I feel
like there's,
there's so many more
opportunities for me there.
And Puck, he's got this
really great pool-cleaning
business opportunity.
And you could audition
for your actor jobs
and you wouldn't even have
to worry about money,
because I'd be able
to support you
you know, as... as
your husband and...
Finn...
what are you doing?
Well, I'm thinking
about my future.
I thought it was our future.
Of course. Of course, it is
our future,
And...
but it feels like
the conversation's
been a little...
one-sided lately.
Look, even Blaine's
brother said
you know, Hollywood is where
you want to go
No, I'm not...
if you want
to be famous
I'm not...
as an actress.
a Hollywood
actress, okay?
In New York, New York
is about the work that you do
and not the work
that you've had done.
There's no other option
here for me, okay?
I am Broadway bound.
Right,
but if I'm going to
be your husband,
shouldn't I have
something to say
about it, too?
"If"?
Just seems like you don't
care about my dreams.
I care.
Of course I care.
Right, of course you care
as long as they don't
interfere with yours.
Look, I need to
be in New York,
and I need you with me.
I can't do this without you.
I just want you
to be really sure.
I just want you to
be really sure
that you're in
love with me
and not who you
want me to be.
