That's funny.
That's appropriate, isn't it?
How does that go? Let's see...
- Merry Christmas.
-  I'm not here.
- Mr. Murray's suite.
- I'm already dead.
-  Yes, of course.
- The answer's no.
- Who is it?
- Your producers, Mr. Murray.
They're outside.
They've heard your beautiful voice, sir.
-  God hates me.
-  Forgive me, Mr. Murray.
But God is your biggest fan.
Number one fan.
Truly a huge fan, Mr. Murray.
- You really think so?
- Number one, sir. Number one.
-  Hey!
-  Hey!
Murray Christmas!
- Get it?
- Yeah...
- Wow, you look festive.
- I would lose those antlers.
Has anyone shown up for this thing?
- We're here.
- Yeah, so that's one friend.
- Paul's here.
-  Yeah, Paul's here.
I wouldn't miss this nutty gig
for the world.
What are you worried about?
Come on. Let's do the show.
- Chop, chop.
- There's no one moving in the whole city.
The airports are closed.
The trains are closed.
The buses and bridges and tunnels
are not working.
A couple of saloons have closed.
The entire city of New York is shut down.
And you're expecting me to go downstairs
and do a show?
- Anything that's fun is always hard.
- That's right.
Oh, it's a miracle.
You two are going to shut up for a second.
- Please be George.
-  Please be George.
- Hey.
-  Is it George Clooney?
- Is it Clooney?
- Is it Clooney?
- Is he on the phone?
- Please, God, let it be Clooney.
How did you get this number?
Now, you'd better tell me because
I'm going to find out. I am working.
Don't ever do this again.
Ever. You got it?
- My sister.
- Family is important.
I need you to produce!
-  Okay.
- Okay.
- How do we cancel this?
- Okay. I understand why you're frustrated.
I would be frustrated, too.
Maybe we shouldn't do it.
- Bev, should we cancel it?
- Okay. You two, grow up.
The satellite is bought and paid for
and non-refundable.
- So we can't cancel.
- You've got to try to cancel.
- We placed all the ads, man.
- Which is so exciting!
- The network has been pro-mo'ing this.
- They are very jazzed about it.
And I don't want to tell you how
personally on the hook you are for this.
You do not want to get sued, Bill.
You don't want to be personally
on the hook. That is scary.
So we've got some weather issues.
Hold on, Bev.
Bill might have a right. Maybe...
Bill has a contractual right to do the
best fucking Christmas show that he can.
Let me guess. You're the bad cop.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
That was a little over the top.
Hey.
- Think of the troops.
- Yeah.
Right? And the kids in hospitals.
And pets outside.
I need my antlers!
You always forget them.
- Jackpot! Here we go.
- Thanks, Paul. Come on.
Here we go. Here we go.
No, no, no, no. No elevator.
The little guys in uniforms who run
these things couldn't make it in today.
Yeah, we're walking. A little exercise
is not going to kill you.
- Come on.
- Goodness me. Dimitri, hold onto these.
This is your idea of a Christmas
special? This is a national disgrace.
Alright, stand down, Double D.
He's just a Hollywood sleaze bag.
I don't even know how to express
my shame in this moment.
The Murricane
skulking down the back stairs
like some 25-dollar-an-hour
Twin Cities hooker.
Go away. I told you.
I don't want a manager, especially you.
Maybe not. But you definitely need one.
Bill, Billy, this sad excuse for
a Christmas special... No harm intended...
Oh, none taken.
Seems more like a Christ-mess,
as in, what a mess!
We have George Clooney.
I rest my case.
You saw
- I was in it.
- Number what? Seven on the call sheet?
- You were so good in that.
- You were great.
You were very good.
What I'm saying
is we all love George, right?
He and I are close.
He's a citizen of the world.
But we need size. We need edge.
If security had come in today,
I would be calling them right now.
Look, just sign with me today, okay?
I know you're a big fish.
But you're not going to snap my line,
okay? I'm hanging on tight.
Here's our Murricane special.
Blimp shot down
into Dallas Cowboys Stadium...
- Done it.
- Retractable roof opens.
- 80,000 screaming fans.
- Yeah.
What? You do it in post.
Camera zooms in.
We see Miley Cyrus wearing a sexy
red mini skirt, sitting on a white sleigh.
- You run in...
- Miley's in Tahoe.
I know Miley.
And that may or may not be true.
Okay, you just have to go away. I'm sorry.
Please just go as far away
as your company will send you.
Miss, could you check him, please?
Thank you.
I've heard that one.
You better check yourself, Bill.
You better run like a thief
from this car wreck.
Total disaster.
Total disaster.
Are you an actress?
Bill Murray
and his celebrity friends gather...
See, Bill? Easy peasy.
We cut from you here live on stage,
to your guests' pre-taped reaction shots.
No one knows you aren't
in the same room together. Boom, done.
- A Christmas miracle.
- You've got to be kidding.
This is from last year's Golden Globes.
That's not going to match.
Yeah, match it...
What does it have to match?
It's all just fantasy, right?
I mean, we're the weavers of dreams.
We're the makers of merry.
- This is all just an illusion.
- Absolutely. It's all an illusion, Bill.
That's Brad Pitt and Angelina.
They're in Africa.
And it's daytime in Africa.
They're not in New York at Bemelmans.
They're in Africa.
Those are huts.
Who sees a hut?
Come on. Bill, calm down and trust us.
Were you nominated for an Emmy
for producing the SAG awards?
- No.
-  Neither were we.
So get up there and do the show.
We go live in 90 seconds.
Bill, I think it's a blessing
that these people didn't show up.
Because now it's your time, you know.
The universe gives us many gifts.
It's whether or not we receive them.
- That's right. Receive the gift.
- This job is always surprising me.
- I'm so alone.
- Okay, Bill...
- You know...
- We're with you...
You know, you and I...
we're not in the same business.
Okay, there he goes. He's going.
Bill, I don't want to pressure you,
but one minute until air.
Five cameras. I like our chances
of someone getting it right.
Let's get ready. Are you ready, Paul?
-  Ready!
- Alright.
-  What are we doing?
-  Let's jingle those bells, buddy.
We're going live
in five seconds, everyone.
Is there a microphone
or do we imagine that, too?
-  Use your stage voice.
-  Yeah.
You're on stage.
There we go. Look.
- We've got one sound guy.
-  Swing the camera. The other way.
You people are disgusting.
- You're looking great up there.
- Crushing it.
eight, seven, six, five, four, three...
Make it great. Two... Go, Bill!
This is a nightmare.
I can't do this. I'm sorry, Ivan.
- I can't do this.
-
I'm sorry. I'm supposed to be laughing.
I want to weep, okay?
I am weeping. I am weeping.
I've never wept on a stage.
This is a first.
I just can't do this. I'm sorry.
We've got to... I don't know.
Show an old football game or something.
I just can't do this.
I've got to run. I've got to hide.
Oh, it's freezing out there.
Oh, God...
Oh, it's cold!
I should have quit right then and there.
I should have stopped
right then and there.
I'd give anything for a guest.
Any kind of medium, half-talented fool.
Whoa! Wait a minute.
- Bill Murray!
- Chris Rock!
Chris! Chris!
Bill, what are you doing here
in the biggest blizzard in the world, man?
- Don't leave. Don't leave.
- I'm not...
Don't leave. Stay, Chris. Stay.
Go around. You can't go that way.
- Counter-clockwise. Counter-clockwise.
- Counter-clockwise!
The other way.
- Counter-clockwise. You are such a pro!
-  It's a pleasure.
Counter-clockwise. Chris!
What's up, man?
How did you get uptown?
- Subway.
- They shut down the subway.
They are. They are.
I had to walk on the rails, man.
- Sit down with me, buddy.
- I'm sitting down, man.
What's going on?
What's all this stuff?
Well, I'm supposed to be doing
a live TV show.
- Okay.
- Live Christmas special.
- Are you in it?
- It just started.
- I'm the only one.
- Oh, man.
You're doing a live special in the middle
of the biggest blizzard of the year.
That is so you, Bill. That is so you.
- But now you're here.
- Yeah.
- And it's us.
- No!
- Yeah!
- No!
- Dust off the pipes a little bit. Sing a...
- I don't sing, Bill.
- You sing. You're a rapper.
- I don't rap.
Do you know me?
Some...
You can do it, Chris.
You've got to help me.
You can be the guy that saved Christmas.
I don't want to...
I can save your Christmas.
But what about mine? I've got
to get out of here. I've got stuff to do.
I've got to get home and build stuff.
I've got to build
a Malibu Barbie Beach House.
- You can't leave. You're trapped here.
- Bill.
- No way you get out of here.
- Bill.
Now, look. All you've got to do
is come in, sing a couple of songs.
Dance a little bit, you know.
We'll put you in some cool clothes.
And I swear on my life I will get you
on the first snowmobile in the morning.
Bill, I barely know you, okay?
- I just met you...
- This is our chance!
- Where's your boys?
- Let's hang! We've got to hang!
Where's George Clooney?
Matt Damon or John Goodman? Your boys!
Why am I here?
Maybe you should postpone this.
Do it a little later.
Is there any way?
No.
I've got to go, Bill.
There is no fucking way
I am doing a live television special.
No way.
I think I'm hearing you.
Look who's here, everybody!
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
Together.
-
-
Hold it. Wait a second.
Is that us?
- Chris?
-
-  Are we still...
-
Chris?
Chris?
Rocky?
Don't try to step off of this.
Where's Chris?
He's gone. And so are we.
Oh, my God.
It's out on the entire Eastern seaboard.
Pack it up, kids. We're out of here.
Amazing. This is good news. Force majeure.
Your contract was voided.
You know what this means?
You're off the hook.
Insurance will cover all of this.
Yeah. It's been a living hell.
See you on the next one, Bill.
Not if there's a God above.
Well, thank you...
Thank you, everyone.
Have a merry Christmas.
Okay.
- Bill.
- Paul.
- Yeah?
- Where are we going?
- You haven't quit drinking yet, have you?
- Should I?
Good man.
Chris and I sounded pretty good there
for a minute or two.
I was moved.
Well, I thought it was beautiful.
Ah, thank you.
The heat's off in here, fellas.
This will help keep you warm.
Well, you, or this, is the nicest thing
that's happened to me all day. To you...
It's Christmas Eve.
It's my favorite night of the year.
The power is out.
The storm is raging outside.
We're in here all cozy.
For now.
For now.
Have another sip. Warm up, hon.
'Cause, baby, it's cold outside.
Can't you stick around?
I'm not kidding. It's really cold out.
Your hands are like ice.
Let me do this to you.
Okay, you flip the records while I pour.
Baby, it's really bad out there.
You couldn't get a cab
if your life depended on it.
This is so corny, but your eyes
look like starlight right now.
Duly noted, you have tried.
Oh, baby, don't hold out on me, please.
Here, look at these hands of yours.
This is ridiculous.
Here, put them right under here.
This is the second warmest spot
on the human body.
This is an old native trick.
This can keep your fingers from freezing,
turning black and falling off.
I'd hate it if you could never
wear gloves again.
I don't think I could forgive myself.
Here. Where's... Give me the other one.
You get pneumonia and die,
it'd be my fault.
You've just got to trust me on this.
Wow. You are so wasted
on the hospitality industry.
Oh, the chefs! I've got to go.
- Oh, let me help. Paul, watch the piano.
- Alright.
The refrigerators are down.
The chefs are freaking out.
Hey, are you guys okay?
She's dying.
You mean she's melting.
I mean dying.
It's a catastrophe!
It's a disaster!
It's not a disaster, it's a celebration!
Tonight will go down
as the greatest night
in the history of the Carlyle Hotel.
Your beautiful food will not die.
It will live forever.
Because we will consume all of it!
Now, quickly, form a human chain.
Pass all the food. Up to the bar.
All women, grab lobsters and vegetables.
Men, any meat that's hanging.
Someone get ice cream.
You look like you'd like to have
your photograph taken with me.
What?
I notice that seems to really
cheer people up a lot when they do that.
They get big smiles.
I don't think that's really
going to do the trick right now.
I saw a cake.
It looked a lot like a wedding cake.
A lot...
Is that yours?
It was supposed to be.
But now... no wedding.
Because none of our family or friends
or guests could make it in.
So it's ruined.
Well, you're preaching to the choir.
We had to cancel everything.
Our dream Bahamas honeymoon, everything.
And then we're trapped in here,
so sad and angry
and things just have gotten...
Elliot, my fiancé, and I
just started fighting.
Yeah, I bet.
So Elliot caused the blizzard.
That bastard.
He ruined my TV special. Where is he?
I think he's in the bar.
Well, he's a little smart.
Want to come in?
They're giving away lobster.
You know, I have a theory
about getting married.
And when I fall in love,
I have vowed to practice it.
Would you like to hear it?
Not really.
- Cool...
- Thanks.
Alright, well,
if you get hungry or thirsty...
Oh, this is an improvement.
This is much better.
Much, much better.
Something is missing, though.
We've got food. We've got booze.
We've got attractive people.
- We need music. Christmas music.
- Oh, music.
We need someone to sing a Christmas carol.
We need a volunteer and
that person is going to be you, Dimitri.
Come on, you Macedonian madman.
No, Mr. Murray, please.
No, no, no. I can't.
You've got to dig deep in your history.
You've got to go deep, to your childhood,
your infancy, if necessary,
and just bring us a Christmas carol.
A one, two...
You're not a singer. And we don't
have time to find out if you're a dancer.
Let's try this fellow.
Scooter, give us something.
I know you know something. Come on.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.
You guys...
are both not working out right.
Come on, my little brandy angel.
You've got... Look at you.
I can... Something...
I could watch you sing that
all night long.
But no one knows the second verse,
am I right? No one?
- You're done with it, right?
-  Yeah.
Sorry. Okay...
I'm going to you guys.
You're going to be my Hail Mary.
How about you fellas play something
that nobody knows.
A pleasure. Key of "D"?
Sure, yes.
Mr. Sandman, I need help.
Can you get in here? Just hit it.
Just you. Just... Just... Do it.
You're a natural.
And you guys can cook, too.
Wow, you're going to be a real catch.
You're Elliot.
- How'd you know that?
- I'm the Ghost of Christmas Present.
I'm here to warn you.
Sorry, sir,
but I'm not in the mood.
For love.
The question is, are you in the mood
for a lifetime of regret and loneliness?
Please go away.
I can't. I'm a ghost. I've got to keep
haunting and haunting and haunting.
There's a lovely girl
in the lobby, crying.
And not over her dead wedding cake.
- See you in a minute.
- Wait...
Peaches, love's got an up button
and a down button
and you decide which one to push.
What?
You ever try a "soiled kimono"?
- No. I...
- Just drink it.
That's it. There you go.
And listen.
Hey, Paul.
Yeah!
Does anyone want a piece of cake?
I think she means you.
Okay, now tell me your theory of love.
Well, it's really more of a philosophy.
Whatever.
Try to remember the specific moment...
the exact second when you knew
that you were really in love.
Not a time or a date or a trip.
But the instant that you knew for sure
you were in love.
And then what?
And then sing about it.
To you?
To each other.
But I'll probably listen.
Will you marry me?
Yes.
By the power invested in me
by the Writers Guild of America,
the Screen Actors Guild
and the Directors Guild...
I'm also on the wait list
to the Teamsters Union...
I now pronounce you two
officially reengaged.
It's 12:01. Merry Christmas, everybody.
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
-  Alright.
Merry Christmas.
We're going to have to make
a Christmas decision.
It's either Slovenia or Mexico, folks.
It's your choice.
Here we go!
Oh, dear...
Oh.
George! You made it!
Well, there was traffic,
so I caught a sleigh.
And you brought Miley Cyrus.
- Of course.
- It's her sleigh.
Hey, save your money.
Flying private, you know...
- It's the reindeers that'll get you.
- Oh, yeah?
Trust me.
-  Hello, Paul.
- So nice to see you.
- I thought I'd make a Martini or two.
- This is the place to do it.
- Hello, ladies.
- Oh, my goodness. The girls are here.
Hi, ladies.
Are you interested in a Martini?
Yeah!
Well... that is wonderful.
Wonderful.
These kids have got something to do.
Let's go make ourselves scarce.
Gosh, it's beautiful isn't it?
Yeah. For a sound stage in Queens...
Break it down for me will ya, Paul?
Now, holy-moly...
Alibaba and the 40 Thieves...
What size shoe is that anyway?
Is that a seven-and-a-half, eight?
Or is that an eight-and-a-half, nine?
Could... Yeah...
You're...
You're awful fine
but I don't think you're mine.
You know there's no place like home
for the holidays and...
I think I'd like you to take me home
or vice versa.
You're driving me crazy, Mama.
I am the king of Christmas.
Oh! Oh! Knock it off! Knock it off!
Come on! I can't breathe!
Look out, old Santa is back.
Thank you.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Murray.
Is it Christmas?
All day.
That's good.
Thank you, Dimitri.
Not too bad.
- Merry Christmas, Bill.
- Merry Christmas, Paul.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Murray.
- Merry Christmas, Dimitri.
Merry Christmas, everyone.
Young lady, cheers to you.
- Cheers.
-  Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Young lady, my ass.
