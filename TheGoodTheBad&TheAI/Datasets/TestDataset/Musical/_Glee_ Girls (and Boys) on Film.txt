Glee:
Glee.
Every Jack and
Jill at the Carousel Club
couldn't take their peepers
off of you tonight.
Oh, applesauce. Oh, honest Injun.
And who could blame them?
You're the eighth Wonder of
the World, Emma Schuester.
You're sunbeams and angel wings
and the Taj Mahal all rolled
into one marvelous dame.
And when we dance
together, why,
my universe
becomes topsy-turvy.
Like gravity was never invented.
Everywhere
that beauty glows you are
Everywhere
an orchid grows you are
Everything
that's young and gay
Brighter than a holiday
Everywhere
the angels play you are
You're like Paris
in April and May
You're New York
on a silvery day
A Swiss Alp
as the sun grows fainter
You're Loch Lomond
when autumn is the painter
You're moonlight
on a night in Capri
And Cape Cod
looking out at the sea
You're all places
that leave me breathless
BOTH:  And no wonder,
you're all the world to me
You're like Paris
in April and May
You're New York
on a silvery day
BOTH:  A Swiss Alp as
the sun grows fainter
You're Loch Lomond
when autumn is the painter
You're moonlight on a
night in Capri
And Cape Cod
looking out at the sea
BOTH:  You're all places
that leave me breathless
And no wonder,
you're all the world to me.
The house is upside down!
Everybody loves movies.
They don't just tell stories...
they transport us
to other worlds.
They are inspirational.
They provide comfort,
and they help us escape
from our day-to-day anxieties.
Like getting left at the altar?
Too soon.
Exactly.
Or in your guys' case,
studying for exams or...
worrying about regionals.
In any case,
for this week's assignment,
I want you to pick
your favorite songs
from your favorite movies.
Unique knows all there is
to know about
KITTY: You don't get dibs on Les Mis
just because you are the poster.
SAM : Finally
I can do my Nicolas Cage
impression. "Oh, not the bees!
No! The bees! No!"
That is the worst Nicolas Cage
impression I've ever seen.
Do you even know
who Nicolas Cage is?
WILL: Okay, it's not
that simple, guys.
This is a group competition...
boys against girls
and we are doing mash-ups.
Now remember,
movies are visual.
So it's not just about
the singing... it's about...
performance,
it's about theatricality,
it's about the language
of cinema.
Preach. And as I move
into production
on my first micro-budget feature...
...I'm happy to offer starring
roles to whichever team wins.
No trailers, no per diem.
WILL:
Great. Okay.
Well, everyone split up
and start working
on your song choices.
You're making a movie?
Yeah.
Hey. Can I talk
to you for a sec?
Yeah.
We should do
so we don't have to sing.
So, how's the case going,
Detective Shue?
Her parents are
stonewalling me and...
I don't have
any other leads right now.
So, what else
have you been up to?
Come on. I'm starting to get
worried about you, man.
Finn, you can't just force
someone to do something.
Right now it's about
taking a step back
and giving her some space.
In the meantime,
I'm catching up on a lot
of old movies.
Really calms me down.
Look...
if she really wants
to be with me,
then she'll come back
on her own.
So, sitting around in front
of the TV is somehow supposed
to make her want to come back?
Of course not. I...
Look, I know she's hurt,
but I'm hurt, too.
You are a good man, and I
really appreciate your concern,
but it's time to leave it alone.
No, it's-it's not.
It... It's time to take action.
Come on.
I'm sorry, Finn Hudson.
But even I don't know
the whereabouts of the lovely
yet fragile Miss
Emma Pillsbury.
But I can tell you she's cashed
in all of her vacation days.
But you don't know where she went?
I have no idea, and frankly,
I resent your flabby
accusation that
just because I wore an exact
replica of her wedding dress
and was the last person to see
her before her Broadway-themed
freak-out that I have anything
to do with her being missing.
I'm not accusing you
of anything.
Well, I assume she's checked
into some ginger asylum
somewhere now
that she's escaped
from Will Schuester's
living dollhouse of the damned.
Even if I were privy to that
information, even if I did know,
I certainly wouldn't divulge it
to a flop sweat-smelling,
fake-teen-teaching,
Army-deserting,
high school-lurking,
sectionals-losing,
special needs, baby-hating...
Point is, Sue didn't know.
There has to be some way
to reach her, Artie.
We owe Mr. Shue that.
Finn, let me dispense
some Hollywood logic on you,
if I may. What we have
on our hands is a lady manhunt.
We need a hard-target search
of every gas station, residence,
warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse,
outhouse and doghouse.
- Ain't nobody got time for that.
- Okay, then just talk to her parents.
- You think?
- Pretty sure that's your only lead.
Doin' a lot of the work here.
Guys, Brittany and I were just talking...
BRITTANY: And we agree
that though we love that it's mash-up
week and that it's girls versus boys...
It sucks that the guys and the
girls can't do a number together,
so we were thinking, just
as a warm-up, we should do
the guys versus girls
in the same number,
to kick things off. And then the
girls can kick the boys' butts.
BLAINE:
Uh, or vice versa.
Which is my favorite
Fred Savage movie.
SAM:
Well, it'd have
to be the perfect movie song,
you know, like, uh...
"Dream Warriors"
from
Yeah, or a good song
like "Let the River Run" from .
MARLEY: Or...
"Wind Beneath My Wings" from .
BLAINE: No, no, no, no.
How about this...
the perfect movie song,
totally iconic and
everyone loves it,
a little ditty from the seminal
American college comedy...
Well...
You know you make me wanna
Kick my heels up and
Throw my hands up and
Throw my head back and
Come on now
Don't forget to say you will
Don't forget to say,
yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Say that you love me
Say that you need me
Say that you want me
I still remember
When you used
To be nine years old
Shooby-doo-wop-do-
wop-wop-wop-wop
Hey, I was
A fool for you
From the bottom of my soul
I want you to know
I want to know
I said I want you
to know right now
I want to know
You been good to me, baby
Good to me, baby
I said I want you to know
right now
I want to know
You know you make me wanna
Lift my head up and
Throw my hands back and
Come on now
Take it easy
A little bit softer now
A little bit softer now
A little bit softer now
A little bit softer now
A little bit softer now
A little bit softer now
A little bit softer now
A little bit softer now
A little bit softer now
A little bit softer now
A little bit softer now
A little bit softer now
A little bit louder now
A little bit louder now
A little bit louder now
A little bit louder now
A little bit louder now
A little bit louder now
Hey-A-Hey-A
Hey-A-Hey-A
A little bit louder now
A little bit louder now
A little bit louder now
A little bit louder now
Jump up and shout now
Jump up and shout now
Jump up and shout now
Jump up and shout now
Jump, jump, jump, jumping up
Jump, jump, jump,
jumping up
Jump, jump, jump, jumping up
Jump, jump, jump,
jumping up
Yeah.
ARTIE: I realize
this number wasn't
in competition,
but you do know it's not even
a mash-up, right?
SANTANA:
: No,
you're doing it wrong, Daisy.
: I can't do it
'cause I'm in love with William.
I just can't.
Oh, do it again, do it again.
:
Welcome...
to Downton Abbey.
So, where you from, Doctor Who?
Uh, England. Do you know Essex?
No. Never heard of it.
Are you guys dating?
Because at Mr. Shue's bomb
of a wedding, you and Blaine, like...
: Shut up,
Santana. Rachel and I are
letting you live here rent-free.
The least you could do is...
Where is Rachel anyways?
Giving that living mannequin
a bikini wax?
Uh, Brody is working and Rachel is
in the bathroom. Well, let's hope
that she's embracing her inner
bulimic because let me tell you,
homegirl has been looking
extremely pumpkin-like
and not just 'cause of the Tan in a Can.
Okay, that's it!
You're gonna have to move out
because this
sanctuary, and by ours,
I mean mine and Kurt's,
and frankly, you make me
feel uncomfortable,
and Brody says that you
make him feel uncomfortable
as well. Girls, girls, retract
the claws, all right?
NYADA canceled all the classes
because of the snow,
so let's just cozy up to our
little movie marathon. Santana,
did you go
through our DVD collection?
I sure did.
Uh,  Hilarity.
that's
obviously Lady Hummel's.
And, uh,  RACHEL:
I don't want to watch any of those.
KURT:
Oh, really, Rachel?
Not even
'Cause you always cry
at the end when
Elizabeth McGovern has
the baby.
I'm not
in the mood, okay?
I'm not in the mood.
KURT:
Okay, fine.
Because I have made
a selection that is perfect
for being snowed-in
in New York City.
bitches.
We love those dancin' hos.
Seriously?
Never knew
I could feel like this
Like I've never seen the
Before
Want to vanish
Inside your kiss
Seasons may change
Winter to spring
But I love you
Until the end
Of
Time
Come what
May...
Come what may...
I will
Love you
Until my dying...
Day...
BOTH:
Suddenly the world
Seems such a
Perfect place
Suddenly it moves with such
A perfect grace
Suddenly my life
Doesn't seem
Such a waste
It all revolves
Around you
And there's no mountain
Too high
No river
Too wide
Sing out this song
And I'll be there
By your side
Storm clouds may gather
And stars may collide
:
But I love you
I love you  Until
Until the end of  The end of
BOTH:
Time
Come what may...
Come
What may...
I will
Love...
You
I will love you.
Kurt, are you crying?
Um... no, no.
My-my contacts are...
really bothering me right now.
I didn't know you wore contacts.
Yes, Rachel,
I just found out I have
a slight astigmatism.
ADAM: Oh, I think I might have
some solution in my bag.
No, no, I'm fine. I'll be good. Don't worry.
I would've thought that
you were crying
because you and Blaine
used to talk about
how this was your dream
to sing this song to each other
at your wedding.
Did we?
Yeah. I remember you telling me
that singing
this song to someone
was a more intimate act
than sex.
Who wants popcorn? Anyone?
SANTANA: No.
Hold on. I'm sorry.
Can we pause this
for a second?
Kurt, please sit down.
I have something
to say, and I have
tried to keep it to myself,
but I will be silent no longer.
What is it? That Brody character
is a freakin' psycho.
Go on.
Here we go. SANTANA: Listen,
when I first met him,
totally thought he was weird.
He smelled all talcum-y
like a Cabbage Patch Doll.
And then he said
that I wasn't a real New Yorker
until I had my first makeover,
and I was, like,
what does that even mean?
Like, who are you?
Oh, come on,
Brody's a sweetheart.
That's what
I told myself, you know?
I said, "So what if he's
completely hairless"
"and made out of plastic... I'm
gonna look past the fact that
"he probably has a disgusting
porn star landing strip.
"I'm gonna give Lars
"and the Real Boy
one more chance." But then
I found... this.
$1,200 in cash.
When did you find that?
Last night when
I was rooting through
all the pockets and drawers
in this apartment.
Wait. What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Santana, you went through
all of our stuff?
Yeah. That's a thing I do.
It's completely unacceptable.
I can't.
Oh, okay. I like
how you guys pretend
to be all accepting
about everything,
but when your friend
suddenly shows up
in your home, moves in
and goes through all your stuff,
you're offended?
Just because he has
a little money on him
doesn't mean
that he's a psycho.
That's what I thought, right?
Who cares if he's
terrified of banks?
'Cause if  were
made out of plastic,
I'd be scared of a lot
of things, too:
Open flames, barbecues. Then...
I found... this.
What is that?
Is that a garage door opener?
This is a pager, my friends.
And there's only one type
of person in this world
that carries cash
a pager.
Your friend Brody...
is a drug dealer.
Okay, so-so let me
get this straight.
You brought us here because
the "Stop Ginger Bullying Club"
founded by our daughter
is in trouble. ARTIE:
We're leaderless.
We're hemorrhaging money.
We won't make it to the end of the month.
ROSE: That's horrible.
Rusty, can't we do something?
You two don't smell
like gingers.
What do gingers smell like?
Gingers smell like pennies.
We have a slight coppery odor.
WOMAN:
It's true.
When Rusty's away
on one of his business trips
to Ecuador and...
I'm really missing him,
sometimes I shove my face
in a bowl full of loose change
and inhale really deeply, and it's
like he's sitting right next to me.
ARTIE:
Look, it's not about the money.
It's about your daughter, Emma.
We just really need
our faculty sponsor
to come back.
See, it's college
application time,
and young
Artie Seymour Hoffman here
really needs a scholarship.
If I were you, I'd
forget about the hair
and lead with the
wheelchair thing.
RUSTY: You don't
want Emma's advice
about college...
she doesn't know anything.
The kids at this school
don't seem to even think
about what college they want
to go to until about a week
before graduation.
That's weird. You're
supposed to figure that out
when you're a junior.
Look, I just need her
to proofread my personal essay.
All we need
is an address.
We just need
to know where she is.
:
Thank you.
Oh, my God, it's getting
worse out there.
We've been snowed in
for 48 hours.
Let's finish watching
before we lose power again.
Or start eating each other.
Oh, no, please spare us.
If I see one more
scene of Satine
coughing up blood
into a handkerchief,
gonna start coughing up
blood into a handkerchief.
Come on, Santana, it's so good,
and we're right
in the middle of it.
Let's put it to a vote. Yea.
Oh, house vote. I say yea.
Yea.  it is.
Well, what about Brody's vote?
Or do drug dealers
not get to vote?
Okay, he's not a drug dealer.
Please, okay?
It's snowing outside.
He's probably
just stranded somewhere.
Do you want me to call him?
Okay. I'll
prove it to you.
Hey, Rach.
Hey, babe. Where are you?
Aw, the bridges are closed...
I'm stuck at my friend's house
in Manhattan.
You remember Leo, right?
Well, I miss you.
We're in the middle
of watching
and so we're getting to the part
where Ewan McGregor cries.
Hey, l-listen,
I, uh, I got to go.
I will be back as soon as I can.
:
Okay.
There you go.
Okay?
:
I'm with you.
Drug dealer.
I hope they mash-up "Batdance"
with "Howard the Duck."
Shh.
Revvin' up your engine
Listen to her howling roar
Metal under tension
Begging you to touch and go
Highway to
The danger zone
Ride into the
Danger zone
Still like that old-time
rock and roll
The kind of music
just soothes my soul
I reminisce
about the days of old
With that old-time
rock and roll
Oh, ho
Heading into twilight
Spreading out
her wings tonight
She got you jumping
off the deck
And shoving into overdrive
Highway to the
Danger zone
I'll take you right
Into the danger zone
Still like that
old-time rock and roll
The kind of music
just soothes my soul
I reminisce
about the days of old
With that old-time
rock and roll
Oh, yeah
Still like that old-time
rock and roll
The kind of music
just soothes my soul
I reminisce
about the days of old
With that old-time
rock and roll
Still like that old-time
rock and roll
The kind of music just soothes
my soul
I reminisce about
The days of old
With that old time
rock and roll
I'll take you
Right into the danger zone
Rock and roll.
Yeah!
FINN: Wow!
FINN:
Wow.
Okay. That was awesome.
Where'd you come up
with the inspiration for that?
Well, it's our tribute
to the early
macho cinema
of one Mr. Tom Cruise.
You can't handle the truth.
: That's
actually Jack Nicholson,
not Tom Cruise. WILL: Girls.
You're up.
Wait for it.
Come on, get out here.
I have a confession to make.
For the past six months,
I've sat behind your back
and in front of your face
that you're poor and fat
and mousy and boring and you
dress like Zach Galifianakis.
I apologize.
God made me, and he's not
through with me yet.
Besides, we're both
dating Puckermans,
and someday we'll be
sister-in-laws and
hanging out with
Jews together.
I totally saw that look.
What's going on?
If I tell you something,
do you swear not to tell anyone?
Swear.
Last week, Ryder kissed me.
OMG.
Was he any good, or did his
humongous donkey teeth
bite into your lips?
He was good, but...
I still like Jake.
Say no more.
I completely get it.
And you're not a slut at all
for playing both sides.
Let me give you some advice,
since we're now BFFs.
Boy are like lumps of coal.
They're dirty and cheap and they
get hot when they're rubbed.
And some turn into diamonds.
So, collect as many as you can.
A kiss on the hand may be
Quite continental
But diamonds are
A girl's best friend
A kiss may be grand
But it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat
Or help you feed your
Yow! Pussycat
Men grow cold as
Girls grow old
And we all lose our charms
In the end
But square-cut
or pear-shaped
These rocks don't lose
their shape
Diamonds are
A girl's best friend
Tiffany's!
'Cause we are living
In a material world
And I am a material
Girl
Come and get me, boys.
Black Star
Ross Cole
Talk to me, Harry Zidler
Tell me all about it
There may come a time when
A lass needs a lawyer
But diamonds are a girl's
Best friend
There may come a time
When a hard-boiled employer
Thinks you're awful nice
But get that ice
Or else no dice
He's your guy when
Stocks are high
But beware when they
start to descend
Diamonds are a girl's
best friend
Let's make love.
Everything's going so we
Oh...
'Cause that's when those
louses
Go ck to their spouses
Diamonds
Are a
Girl's
Best
Friend
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Wow, come on, you guys.
Let's give it up for girls...
What's shakin', bacon?
Oh, hey.
Just practicing my
basic pirouettes.
Every aspiring actor
needs to know
how to do them.
is lousy with them.
Thanks for giving me shelter
from the storm.
I was a little sad we, uh,
weren't snowed in
a little longer.
Ah, I know, I always
get a little sad
when the sun comes out
and the snow starts to melt
and all the snowmen look like
they have scoliosis.
But it was nice
to hang out with you and,
uh, watch a few movies.
Well,
a movie.
A movie.
Look, about that...
Uh...
I'm gonna ask you something
and I want you to be honest.
You and Blaine did used to sing
that duet together, didn't you?
Yeah.
But it feels like
a lifetime ago.
Maybe that's what's
hard about it.
You still love him, don't you?
Was I your rebound?
No. No.
'Cause I can't compete
with a fantasy, Kurt.
I desperately want
to be over him.
Really, I do.
Good.
Then let's go to the
movies right now.
Oh, I'm serious.
We are going to go and find
the sappiest love
story that we can,
and then that
will be our movie.
Tomorrow, we watch.
Spielberg's
Uh... sorry.
I found her.
What? Where?
She's been staying
at her sister's house
up on Hilltop Lane.
You got to go to her.
I-I think she made it
pretty clear
she doesn't want to see me.
Well, then you have to make her
want to see you.
Come on, Mr. Shue,
y-you don't have a choice.
This is like in the
third act of the movie,
where the heartbroken guy
chases through the crowded
city streets
to win his girl back,
and then he does some
big romantic gesture,
and the music swells,
and then the crowd applauds,
and their eyes well
up with tears...
And then she'll take you back.
That's just the way it works.
Love
I get so lost
Sometimes
Days pass
And this emptiness
Fills my heart
When I want to run away
I drive off
In my car
But whichever way I go
I come back to the place
You are
All my instincts
They return
The grand facade
So soon will burn
Without a noise
Without my pride
I reach out
From the inside
In your eyes
The light, the heat
I am complete
I see the doorway
To a thousand churches
The resolution
Of all the fruitless
Searching
Oh, I see the light
And the heat
WOMEN:
Oh, I want to be
That complete
WOMEN:
I want to
Touch the light, the heat
I see in your eyes
Yeah
In your eyes
Oh-ooh-oh
In your eyes  Oh, oh
In your eyes
Oh, oh  In your eyes.
Will, are you crazy?
Crazy for you.
But that's  Quest,
and Matthew Modine
skipping rope isn't nearly
as romantic as John Cusack
holding a boom box.
Please, get down here
so I can tell you
how much I love you,
and how I'm
gonna let you go.
Guys.
Oh, yeah.
You can take off now.
Oh, can I get my...
Thanks so much.
See you. Bye.
All right, great. Good job.
It went well.
Good job. Thanks, guys.
I'm sorry I've kept you
in the dark for so long.
I know that must have
been hard for you.
Hard?
No, losing sectionals is hard.
Losing the woman
I plan on spending
the rest of my life with?
A-And not knowing why?
It was devastating.
I didn't explain because I'm...
I'm not even sure
I understand it yet myself.
I-If you were to write
yourself a pamphlet,
what would it be called?
Seriously.
Um...
"So You're Freaking Out
Because the Man You're.
"About to Marry Parades
Back into Town,
and You Don't Feel Like
You Know Him Anymore."
Is that really
what this is all about?
Why couldn't you just come talk
to me about it? What was
I supposed to say, Will?
"I... let's postpone
the wedding,
"let's send everybody home,
"let's get to know each other
"all over again?" I...
I would have preferred that
to standing at the altar alone
with everyone staring at me.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't take two
seconds to think.
I just... I just ran.
So, what happens now?
I don't know.
I think we need
to start from scratch.
Maybe with a movie
on Friday night?
See if we can get to know
each other
all over again.
I think that would be nice.
Okay, New York
may be disgusting,
especially when it's
covered in gray, nasty snow,
and the people
may be horrible and rude,
and some smelly homeless man
in pee-stained tighty-whities
might have groped me
on the subway,
and  asked me for a dollar,
but I gots to say,
I finally feel like
I have found my people.
Glad that you found
your corner of the sky, Santana.
Where are the Hardy Boys?
Investigating the mystery of.
"God, Could You Be
Any More Annoying?"
Kurt and Adam are at NYADA.
And Pablo Escobar?
Did he ever come home?
Brody is in the shower.
Where he will be
for the next hour,
scrubbing the drug shame
off of his frictionless body.
For the hundredth time, okay, if you
keep making fun of Brody... I'm not.
I mean, I am. Just, not now.
Okay, look,
now that we're alone,
I want to talk to you
about what I found
in your bathroom trash can,
could have only be yours.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
Rachel... you're really not
gonna tell me about the stick?
You had no right.
Rachel,
I'm your friend,
you can trust me.
Just tell me what's going on.
Oh, God.
You're gonna be okay. It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.
Hey.
What's going on in here?
You wanted to see me?
Uh, yes. I wanted to talk to you
about what happened
on Valentine's Day.
I lied.
I didn't come up with
all that romantic stuff.
Ryder did.
I-I didn't mean to lie.
It's just that all this trust
and monogamy... it's new for me.
I'm into it.
I just...
I got nervous.
I was trying to impress you.
So,
I came up with this on my own.
This is not what I think it is.
Oh, yes, it is.
Come here, sit down.
I am singing your favorite song
from your favorite
romantic movie.
Second favorite romantic movie?
Okay.
Oh, my love
My darling
I've hungered for your touch
Are you
Still mine?
I need your love
I...
Need your love
God speed your love
To
Me
RYDER AND JAKE:
Lonely river sigh
"Wait for me, wait for me"
I'll be coming home
Wait for me
Wait for me
JAKE:  Time
Goes by
So slowly
And time can do
So much
Are you
Still mine?
Ah...
I
RYDER AND JAKE:
Need your love
JAKE:  I...
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love
God speed your love
To
To
JAKE AND RYDER:
Me
Yeah
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Ooh
Oh, Jake, stop.
I'm sorry. Uh...
I lied about
Valentine's Day, too.
I knew it was Ryder.
But I didn't care because
it was so sweet that you tried.
Ryder kissed me.
And I let him.
Jake.
Are you...?
Jake? Jake, don't leave.
Girls rule, as usual.
And we should win
for these sweet glasses alone.
WILL: Ladies and gentlemen,
the time has come
for the announcement
of this year's
mash-off winner.
Who of course, will be starring
in my senior film project...
a tribute to dance on film.
WILL:
And the winner is...
everyone.
What?
Why do you always do this?
That's insane.
This is a sham.
Why don't you just send Maria
Shriver in to give us all hugs?
In reality, what you're saying
is, we're all losers.
Why did we bother having a
competition in the first place?
Calm down, y'all.
Calm down.
After exhaustive storyboarding
and pre-production,
I realized that I needed a lot
of talented bodies
to make this film great.
So, choosing one winner
was just simply impossible.
That is exactly right.
Uh, Finn, can I talk to you
in the hallway for a sec?
Ooh! ARTIE: Yeah.
Everybody's gonna in it.
So, who's the lead?
Who's gonna be the lead?
ARTIE: There is no lead...
There's no lead.
Yeah, 'cause there's no point.
No. You guys are awesome
together. I mean...
We're gonna be the leads.
Yay!
Yay!
Boy meets girl, boy loses girl.
Boy mopes around
and sits on his ass
until his best man
helps save the day.
Thank you.
Yeah, I-I... I mean, you would
have done the same thing for me.
You have, like,
probably a thousand times.
So, uh, you and Miss Pillsbury
talked it all out?
Yeah. I mean,
I actually think
all this craziness
was for the best.
I mean, I actually think
it's going to make our
relationship stronger.
She say anything about me?
No. Why would she?
Because I kissed her.
Well, she...
she was freaking out about the
wedding, and going all AC/DC,
and I-I tried to calm her down.
And then I just... I kissed her.
But I didn't mean to
because I don't even
think of her like that.
I swear.
And I tried to tell you,
but I couldn't,
because I knew
that it would ruin
everything, and it's all
my fault, so just...
just go ahead
and just-just punch me,
or whatever,
because I deserve it.
I'm so sorry.
I've been workin' so hard
I'm punchin' my card
Eight hours for what?
Oh, tell me what I got
I've got this feeling
That time's just
holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else
I'll tear up this town
Tonight I gotta cut loose
Footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise,
pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back
Come on, before we crack
