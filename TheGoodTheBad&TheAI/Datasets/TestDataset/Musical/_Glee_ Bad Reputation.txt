So here's whad
on Glee:
Jesse left Vocal Adrenaline...
JESSE: I'm a star.
You can learn from me.
...so he could date Rachel, so now he's
part of the glee club.
Great to have you here.
And they're
the new power couple.
Previous power couples:
Rachel and Finn...
I made us his and her
relationship calendars.
Oh.
...also, Rachel and Puck.
Want to make out?
Sure.
Will still
has a crush on Emma...
I could just lean over and kiss
you if I want to. And I want to.
But he hasn't divorced
Terri yet, and he made out
with the coach
of Vocal Adrenaline.
Most of the show choir directors
I make out with are gay.
And Sue?
Sloppy freak
show babies!
Still just kind of
angry about everything.
SUE:
Who wants a piece of it? Huh?
And that's what
you missed on Glee.
{laughter}
{"Physical" by
Olivia Newton-John playing}
What's so funny?
You guys aren't watching
the video of me falling
off stage at my first TinyTots
beauty pageant, are you?
That was Carrot Top funny
compared to this comedic
tour de force.
JESSIE: That's Olivia
Newton-John's "Physical."
It was pretty groundbreaking
subject matter at the time,
considering it's depiction
of fluid sexuality.
MERCEDES:
Oh, my good...
{laughter}
Wait, wait.
That's not Olivia Newton-John.
That's, that's
Sue Sylvester.
Where did you get this?
I can tell you
that I certainly did not
steal it from her locked
file cabinet yesterday
when she sent me
back to her office
to get her hormone
replacement injection
during Cheerios!
practice.
{laughter}
Wait,
did she just do
the Cabbage Patch?
{laughter}
I'm posting this
on YouTube.
RACHEL:
No, no, wait, wait.
Do you think
that's a good idea?
She might kill us.
Oh, let her get a
taste of some of
the humiliation
she put us through.
JESSIE:
I'm with Finn.
You guys need to stop being such
asses and start being bad-asses.
{laughter}
Ten bucks it goes
viral by lunch.
¶¶ Let's get animal, animal... ¶¶
Hey, Ms. Sylvester.
Let's get physical.
Not really my type,
but I like that attitude.
Hey, Sue!
Let's get animal!
{school bell ringing}
That glee club stole my private
property and posted it online.
And as soon as I figure out
the difference between
slander and libel,
I'm filing a lawsuit.
WILL:
Sue, don't you think
you might be
overstating this a little?
Will, I may buy
a small diaper for your chin,
because it looks like
a baby's ass.
That video has received
over 170,000 comments.
I took the liberty of
printing out a few.
"The man in this video
looks like
the champion cheerleading coach
Sue Sylvester."
That was particularly hurtful.
{clears throat}
You know, Sue, there are a lot
of people at this school
who dislike you.
My kids don't do
stuff like this.
Is that so?
Exhibit B.
What's a "Glist"?
It's the "Glee List" William.
It's a weekly ranking
of your glee club,
based on a hotness quotient
of sexual promiscuity.
It was posted all over
the school an hour ago.
Apparently, you get a point
for each act of
perpetuated depravity.
What makes you think
my kids did this?
This Glist was made
on a library computer
using the pass code "gleeclub."
Your glee club is
a petri dish of
sexual depravity.
Sue's right, Will.
Why, only last year,
a list was posted
ranking McKinley's
ten ugliest Gingers.
And the perpetrator
would have
been expelled
had it not turned out
to be a member of the faculty!
I stand by that list.
William, this is serious.
I cannot have an environment
that sexualizes children
and damages their self-esteem!
You know, a week ago,
had I fod a list
that so degraded the glee club,
I would've been embarrassed
I was beaten to the punch.
But now I know the
white-hot shame
of public rebuke-- that
pain is indescribable.
William, last year,
at West Dayton High,
a photo circulated of
school superintendent...
And what was
he wearing?
Women's lingerie.
And what was
he riding?
Pony!
And who was
expelled?
The entire school!
The entire school
was expelled, will!
What does that
have to do with me?
You must find out
who made the Glist
and suspend them before
they post another one,
or I'm holding the entire
glee club responsible!
Are you serious?
Deadly serious!
I cannot have these
shenanigans at this school!
He cannot have these
shenanigans at this school!
Who did it?
This is serious.
Principal Figgins is threatening
to disband the club.
Why are we playing this game?
We all know it was Puck.
Back off.
I didn't do squat.
Then why is your girlfriend
first on the Glist?
And why am I last?
Aside from the fact that I
refused to put out for you.
Okay, enough! No one is
accusing anyone of anything.
Puck, seriously,
did you do it?
I said no.
I'm a delinquent, sure.
I like setting
stuff on fire
and ating up
people I don't know.
I own at.
But I'm not a liar.
All right, here's
the important point.
Between this and posting
Coach Sylvester's
personal video on YouTube,
you guys are getting
a pretty bad
reputation.
Why is that a bad thing?
Maybe if we seem more dangerous,
people would stop flushing
my glasses down the toilet.
Look, things are
hard right now.
I get it.
You're under a lot
of pressure
with regionals coming up.
And I know that winning
sectionals hasn't had
the positive effect
on your popularity
that a lot of you
thought it would.
But becoming what you despise
is not the answer.
Man, this song is wack.
No, it's not.
It's a terrific song
on a long list
of top hits that,
because of time or some
bad press, has become a joke.
And, like you guys,
it's time to start
rehabilitating
its bad reputation.
The assignment
for the week
is for all of you
to find songs like this,
mine them for what works
and make them great again.
And then, hopefully,
can apply this musical lesson
to your own lives.
This song should be arrested
for the crime of sucking.
{laughter}
Mm-hmm.
You want to bet?
{oohing, murmuring}
Oh, no, he didn't.
Hit it.
{"Ice Ice Baby" playing}

¶¶ Ice, Ice, baby ¶¶

Yo, man, let's get out of here.
Word to your mother.
{music stops, laughter}
This song is officially paroled!
{cheering}
Right, Jessie?
You got me?
{bell ringing}
{murmuring}
SUE:
This is not happening.
The cruel slow-motion laughter
is just your imagination.
because of
your "Physical" video.
Just calmly pour yourself
a cup of joe and focus.
It's usually masked
by the smell of fear.
Sweet merciful Lord,
this is happening!
You're being laughed at
in slow motion
by a roomful of inferiors
whom you used to terrify.
The name is Brenda.
Brenda Castle.
I just transferred
from Fort Wayne.
I can't teach in
Indiana anymore
'cause I have some
"drug problems"
that ended up involving
some of my "shoot-ins."
{laughing}:
I saw your video.
And you, my friend,
are an embarrassment.
And that's me talking!
{laughter echoes}
{bell ringing}
I need to enlist the
services of the A/V Club.
What did you
have in mind?
My shame at appearing so low on
the Glist has made me reevaluate
my image at this school
and beyond.
I've now realized
that in today's culture
of bad boy athletes
and celebrity sex tapes,
a good reputation
is no good at all.
Artie, you know how our
Glee Club assignment was
to find a song with
a bad reputation
and rehabilitate it?
Well, mine is going to afford me
the worst reputation
in this school.
Rachel Berry is going to get
a little down and dirty.
I'm going to stop you.
You had me at "sex tape."
How can I help?
Hold onto your hat,
because Rachel Berry
is going to become
{whispers}:
musically promiscuous.
because our free-falling reps
have reached terminal velocity.
We are at Defcon One.
We're such zeros they
didn't even bother
putting us on
the Glist.
What does a C-lister do
when their tiny star
is about to fall off Perez
Hilton's radar screen?
They cause a
scandal so extreme
they can no longer
be ignored.
Um, excuse me.
Why is she here?
I've been here
since first period.
I had a cold, and I
took all my antibiotics
at the same time, and now
I can't remember how to leave.
But I also don't know why
I've only made fourth
on the Glist.
I've made out with, like,
everyone in this school.
Girls, boys,
Mr. Kidney the janitor.
I need to do
something to get into
the top three.
Fine, you're in.
In what?
We don't even
have a plan.
What is the worst thing
a student can do at this school?
Eat in the cafeteria?
{snickering}
No, be a disruption
in the library.
And I'm not
talking about
trying to check out
a reference book.
Mm-mm.
I'm talking about
full-on chaos--
including getting
your Glee on in the stacks.
Genius.
I never really understood
how hard it is to be laughed at.
Particularly in slow motion.
I try to make it seem
like nothing
can touch me, but...
Boy...
Jean, I'm so sorry you
ever felt that way.
I'm sorry I didn't
protect you more.
Remember what we used
to do, Sue?
Whenever I got sad,
we'd help at the animal shelter,
to give back.
Because there's always someone
who's got it worse than you do.
{bell ringing}
I'm a little confused.
I understand.
You're probably wondering, what
exactly does Sue Sylvester mean
when she says,
"I'm your new therapist"?
Well, let me explain.
As you may or may not know, I
star in a little music video
that's been circulating
around the Web.
A video that has
a tendency to induce
cruel, slow-motion laughter.
No, no, didn't-didn't
know about that.
Well, this video
has inspired Sue Sylvester
to start giving back.
I happen to have my Masters
in counseling,
and when I heard that
our school district's
one and only psychologist
had committed suicide,
well, I decided to volunteer
my services.
And they gave
me your name.
I'd really like to help.
I don't know how I'm supposed
to feel about this.
Ella, you're crippled
by mental illness.
Your compulsions
have estranged you
from your own feelings.
You nearly married a gym teacher
who's more gravy than man.
And you're content
to be repeatedly lied to
by the man
you purport to love.
I'm sorry?
I bribed
Will Schuester's landlord
to slip baby monitors
under his couch,
and under his bed.
Turns out he's been having
make out sessions
with the coach from
Vocal Adrenaline,
and sleepovers with that
world-class banana magnet
April Rhodes.
Oh, my God.
You need to make a bold move.
You suck.
Excuse me?
You take weird little strides
when you walk,
as if you were raised
in imperial Japan
and someone bound your feet.
You make a valid point.
Grow a pair.
I'm insulting you.
You refuse to stand up
for yourself,
you're so afraid
of confrontation.
You're right.
If you want to get better,
you need to start communicating
your feelings.
You need to let
Will Schuester know
how he's made you feel,
and in a public setting,
so he can'escape,
and he won't
manipulate you.
Trust me--
you need to let him have it.
RACHEL:
Do you know that when we dated,
the rest of the school
gave us a nickname?
Puckleberry.
That's humiliating.
The fact is that
slumming it with me
actually improved
your reputation.
It gave you a sense of humanity.
Wait-- do you want
to date again?
I was wondering why
you invited me here.
As you know, I'm taken.
But I can be of
some assistance.
Help me with my song for
Glee Club. I might be
the last chance
you have to salvage
what's left of
your reputation,
and stay in Glee.
Besides, you need a song
that going to help you
express your inner pain.
So what song do you want to do
for your assignment?
I've chosen David Geddes'
fantastically terrible
'70s top ten hit--
"Run Joey Run."
It's a story song.
So we get to play parts.
I'm going to play the role
of the tragic heroine
who dies in the end,
ÃÂ¡ la Nicole Kidman
in Moulin Rouge.
And you can be the
hunky, heroic male lead.
Do I get to kill you?
Actually, my dad shoots
me with a shotgun.
{sighs}
Do you think I made
that Glist? Honestly.
Well, it does sound like
something that you would do.
God, I'm so tired of people
judging me
for a few mistakes I've made.
I try to be
a good guy.
I go to school and I say,
"Be cool, Puck. Be nice."
But by second period, I've got
a fire extinguisher in my hands
and I'm spraying
some dweeb with it
and I don't know
how I got there.
I understand. Yeah.
I sit in Glee Club
and I watch
a couple of imperfect
performances
and a litany of criticisms
just start building up
inside of me like a volcano
and I keep telling myself
to hold it in
and then it just
comes bursting out.
Granted, generally
I'm right,
but doesn't do much
for my reputation.
It does suck when you do that.
So, uh, how do you think
we can get people to
see us differently?
I don't know.
I can't-- I can't do this.
You know, whoever made
ÃÂ£ that Glist is going to
put you at number one
when they find out you cheated
on that Jessie kid with me.
Besides, Jessie will never
fully understand what it
means to be a Jew.
Noah...
I'm ironically turned on
by your bad boy image,
but I think we should
just keep this professional.
All right, I'm out.
Why should I stay if there's
no chance of us making out?
Noah, please come and sit down
and let's work on the project.
Okay, it'll help us both.
I promise.
- {bell rings}
- I don't think I can do this.
Are you sure this
is a good idea?
Stop thinking about him
and do it for yourself.
Okay, let's do this.
Nah, can't go in
the teacher's lounge.
Lots of cruel, slow-motion
laughter going on in there.
Well, look who it is.
I thought I smelled
a laughingstock.
Don't start with me
Castle, or I will kick
you square in the taco.
It's a date.
That's just a typical
Saturday night in
the Castle condo.
I think it's mornings...
Yeah.
Go get 'em.
Some days you...
That's okay.
Excuse me.
Oh, hey, Em, can you
just give us a sec?
Actually no.
Will, I can't give you a sec.
You're just going
to have to reschedul
your heavy petting session with
Mrs. Carlisle for a later time.
Emma!
I beg your pardon?
I was just telling
Mr. Schuester
about how my husband
recently died.
Wow.
Getting them fresh off the
rebound now, aren't you?
Amazing. Nobody's safe.
Nobody is safe.
Emma, can I talk
to you in private?
No, you can't.
Will, we're going to talk
about this here and now,
because I have absolutely
nothing to hide.
Actually, did you know
I was seeing a therapist?
Do you know that? Did you
know I've been trying
to work through my OCD
so I could be with you?
Will, do you think
that's fun for me?
It's not fun; it's
absolutely humiliating.
And come to find out
you've been fooling around
with some woman
named Shelby,
and you slept
with April Rhodes.
How did you find out
about that?
You're not denying it.
Wow, okay.
See, I thought we were trying
to work through this.
I thought when you said you
were trying to figure out things
on your own, I thought
you meant that.
I'm not going to stand
for this anymore.
I'm not. I'm putting
my foot down,
and I am finally
sticking up for myself.
You're a slut, Will.
You're a slut.
You're a slut, you're a slut,
you're a slut.
Everybody should know that.
And you should know that
I'm through with you.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
{bell ringing}
Looks like we got
a full house, y'all.
I'm kind of getting
cold feet here.
Can you even
feel your feet?
Shh!
Team, listen up.
If we pull this off, we will be
legends at this school.
We'll rocket
up the Glist.
We will be top-five, easy.
Artie, pump up the jam.
It's about to go down.
You can't touch this.
¶¶ My, my, my music hits me
so hard ¶¶
¶¶ Can't touch this ¶¶
¶¶ Makes me say, oh, my Lord ¶¶
¶¶ Thank you for blessing me ¶¶
¶¶ With a mind to rhyme
and two hype feet ¶¶
¶¶ It feels good,
when you know you're down ¶¶
¶¶ A super dope homeboy
from the Oaktown ¶¶
¶¶ And I'm known as such ¶¶
¶¶ And this is a beat,
uh, you can't touch ¶¶
¶¶ I told you, homeboy ¶¶
¶¶ Can't touch this ¶¶
¶¶ Yo, let me bust
this funky lyric ¶¶
¶¶ Can't touch this ¶¶
¶¶ Fresh new kicks advance,
you gotta like that ¶¶
¶¶ Now you know you wanna dance ¶¶
¶¶ So move, outta your seat ¶¶
¶¶ And get a fly girl
and catch this beat ¶¶
¶¶ While it's rolling,
hold on ¶¶
¶¶ Pump a little bit and let
'em know it's going on ¶¶
¶¶ Like that, like that ¶¶
¶¶ Cold on a mission
so fall them back ¶¶
¶¶ Let 'em know
that you're too much ¶¶
¶¶ And this is a beat, uh,
you can't touch ¶¶

can't touch this ¶¶

¶¶ You can't touch this ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, oh, oh ¶¶
¶¶ Damn, you can't touch this ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, oh, oh ¶¶
¶¶ I told you, can't touch this ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh ¶¶
¶¶ Too high,
you can't touch this ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, oh, oh ¶¶
¶¶ Yo, we out of here,
can't touch this. ¶¶
{gasping}
Here it comes.
That was very cute.
I'm gonna talk to my pastor
and see if I can't get
you kids to perform that
for our Sunday service.
, I don't like doing this
any more than you do,
but if I don't find out
who made that Glist
and stop another one
from being published,
the whole Glee Club's
going down.
And I can't
let that happen.
Look, I know I've been
kind of angry lately,
and sometimes I kick over
chairs and stuff,
but I didn't do it.
All the pieces fit, Finn.
You have a very big axe to grind
with several people
on that Glist.
Quinn broke your heart, Puck
betrayed your friendship,
you're dealing with Kurt's
dad dating your mom,
and I happen to know you've
had your ups and downs
with Santana and Brittany...
I have nothing against Santana,
and I like Brittany.
Quinn's the one who has
a beef with them.
Well, there are an awful lot
of Cheerios! on that Glist.
Isn't it true
that you still feel like
an outcast in that group?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
I like being a Cheerio.
And why does everyone just
assume I'm angry all the time?
It's called being sassy,
Mr. Shue.
It's simple math,
Mr. Shue.
The Glists are posted at a
height of five and a half feet,
comfortably out of my reach.
It could not have been me.
And I have it on
good word that...
I saw Puckutting up the Glist
in the hallway.
I was moving it!
Somebody put it up on
Rachel's locker, so I moved it.
I was being a man,
doing the right thing.
Puck, at some point,
the lies are going to stop,
and you're going to start
to sing.
If I did it, why would
I put myself at number three?
As far as bad-asses go,
I'm number wha.
I'll say it again,
I didn't do it!
I don't know
how to turn on a computer.
Rachel did it.
Think about it:
I stole the guy
she's in love with,
then I stole the guy she dated
to get over the guy
she's in love with.
And I'm kind of a bitch to her.
Just doesn't seem like Rachel.
She's gone behind
your back before.
And I mean, who's to say that
there's only one culprit?
Look, I know you know something!
So we're not leaving here
until I get some answers.
Mr. Schuester, may I be blunt?
{sighs}
Shoot.
Ever since you separated
from your wife,
you've spent a lot
of late nights
watching reruns of
Law and Order, haven't you?
Hmm. Thought so.
And no, I didn't make the Glist.
{sighs}
Right.
{bell ringing}
We're as menacing
as Muppet Babies.
Which means our
squeaky-clean reputations
are still very much intact.
We have to do
what we've been dreading,
something more terrifying
than Rachel's personality--
We have to go to Sylvester
and admit that we
posted the Physical video.
But we'll get suspended.
And it will be worth it.
Finally the entire
student body
will see us as bad-asses.
Dear Journal, I don't know
how much longer
The video has just surpassed
three million hits.
Is my misery some kind
of karmic retribution
for the way
I've treated people?
{phone ringing}
You're go for Sue.
Hello? Sue?
It's Olivia Newton-John,
star of Grease--
the most successful movie
musical of all time.
Nice try.
And that's a ridiculous accent.
Uh...
Journal, I've learned
my lesson.
Sue Sylvester's gotta start
playing nice full-time.
{phone rings}
Hi! Uh, we must have
been cut off.
It's Olivia Newton-John.
I released a record
seven-consecutive
number one singles.
Sing something.
¶¶ Let's get physical ¶¶
¶¶ Physical... ¶¶
That song was the best-selling
record of the '80s.
Listen, Sue, I'm headed
for a ribbon-cutting ceremony
at a sanctuary
for orphaned koalas,
but I heard my daughter Chloe
laughing at something
on the Internet the other day,
and I saw your video.
And I just have to ask,
whatever would possess a person
to do something like that?
Well, I gotta tell you, Olivia,
that video was never meant
for public consumption.
Some people enjoy videotaping
themselves
being intimate with a partner.
I happen to enjoy revisiting
the impeccable form
of my various jazzercise
routines.
Well, it got me thinking.
You know, that song was
the biggest hit of my career.
"Physical" spent ten weeks
at number one.
It's a classic.
I agree.
Unfortunately, I botched
the video, which,
by the way, was one of the first
music videos ever.
But I filled it with obese guys
in spandex,
and it went over the top,
and the song went with it.
But I saw
your YouTube video, Sue,
and I realized that now
is the time
to save it--
and possibly you.
I'll be in Ohio tomorrow
chairing
a benefit for Save the
Rainforests at King's Island.
I don't understand.
{bell ringing}
Hey, man-whore.
Will Schuester?
Yeah.
I'm Brenda Castle.
I'm the new astronomy teacher
and badminton coach.
I also happen
to be an alcoholic,
and... I like pills.
I hear that's
just your type.
Let's go in this classroom
and pork!
No.
I am praying
for you, William.
We've all heard
about your gallivanting!
But nothing happened!
Maybe that's not
what matters, Will.
You broke the heart
of somebody
who doesn't let people
get close to her.
I didn't mean
to hurt anybody.
You probably didn't mean
to hurt me, either,
but lately I've been feeding
my feelings to the tune
of 6,000 calories a day.
{sighs}
Slut.
Remember-- if Sylvester
hits you in the fbce
after you cop
to posting the video,
don't scream like a woman.
You're so brave
for doing this, Kurt.
I know. Thank you.
Oh, my God...
Coach Sylvester, can I have just
a minute of your time?
What do you want, ladyface?
You're aware a tape was leaked
onto the Internet,
causing you to become
a national laughingstock?
We stole the tape from your
syringe-and-pill drawer.
We posted it online.
We'll accept whatever punishment
you see fit.
So it was you.
I can't thank you enough.
ARTIE:
She wasn't angry at all.
It was weird.
Maybe the comments
online have gotten
so mean, people have started
to feel sorry for her.
She's finally getting
some sympathy,
so she's in a
forgiving mood.
Wait a second.
Take a look at this.

MERCEDES:
Whew!
Yeah.
Again, again, again, again,
Again, again, again, again!
Yeah.
I need to learn
to do this verse.
All day.
All righty.
{bell ringing}
WILL:
All right, guys, listen up.
Another week has almost passed.
If a list goes up again
later today,
this issue is out of my hands,
and it becomes Principal
Figgins' jurisdiction.
Seriously, Mr. Shue,
whoever made that list
is not gonna come
forward.
We might as well just bend over
and take whatever's coming.
Fine.
Okay.
Well, then, uh,
let's get to it.
Rachel, how about you show us
your bad reputation project?
I'd like to say
a few words first.
Though I understand
that a motion picture
should stand on its own,
I do realize that some of you
are not well-versed
in the complex vocabulary
of the filmic arts.
I expect that this video will go
over some of the heads
of our less-cultured teammates.
So let me just say
I hope you enjoy
my "Bad Reputation."
Lights. Okay, go.

we're gonna get married ¶¶

¶¶ Every night
the same old dream ¶¶
¶¶ I hate to close my eyes ¶¶
¶¶ I can't erase the memory ¶¶
¶¶ The sound of Julie's cry ¶¶
¶¶ She called me up
late that night ¶¶
¶¶ And she said,
"Joe, don't come over ¶¶
¶¶ "My dad and I just had
a fight ¶¶
¶¶ "And he stormed out

JESSIE:

like mad ¶¶

with tear-filled eyes ¶¶

¶¶ Then Julie yelled,
"He's got a gun!" ¶¶

in front of me ¶¶
¶¶ Then, suddenly,
a shot rang out ¶¶
¶¶ And I saw Julie falling ¶¶
¶¶ I ran to her,
I held her close ¶¶
¶¶ When I looked down,
my hands were red ¶¶
¶¶ And here's the last words ¶¶
¶¶ Julie said... ¶¶
¶¶ Daddy, please don't,
it wasn't his fault ¶¶
¶¶ He means so much to me ¶¶
¶¶ Daddy, please don't ¶¶
¶¶ We're gonna get married... ¶¶

¶¶ Run, Joey, run, Joey, run ¶¶
¶¶ Joey, run, Joey, run ¶¶
¶¶ Joey, run, Joey, run! ¶¶
{song ends}
Well, why don't we just, um,
take a moment
to really absorb
what we've just watched.
This is garbage!
Finn!
No, he's right.
First of all, I need to trust
my instincts more
because I had a feeling
when we were shooting that, that
it was not going to be good.
Why didn't you tell me
they were in this, too?
I thought you
and I were going out.
Being triple-cast
with two other guys
to play opposite
your girlfriend?
It's mortifying.
It was an artistic statement.
FINN:
No. it wasn't!
It was you
trying to look like
you had a bunch of guys fighting
over you
so you could stop looking like
some kind
of outcast and be seen
as some hot slutty girl singer!
How could you do this to me;
to all us guys?
Is your stupid reputation
more important
than your relationships?
Jessie, wait!
JEAN:
I saw your video, Sue!
You were fabulous!
You know, I have
to thank you, Jean.
You always know exactly
what to say to me
when I lose my way.
Turns out all I needed
was an attitude change.
I forgot how good
it feels to give back.
I've spent
so much time worrying
about what other people
thought about me,
when there's really
only one person in the world
I want to impress.
Who?
Who? You, silly.
So, yesterday,
I walked
back into that teachers' lounge,
and I calmly informed them
of my unlikely skyrocket
to showbiz fame,
and very gently
told them all I just didn't care
what they thought about me.
What's that? Oh, look.
Sue Sylvester is a top 700
recording artist, people!
Who's laughing now, huh?
Now, since Olivia is giving
her cut of the proceeds
to injured manatees,
I've decided to give
all of my profits
to this nursing home.
It's not going to be much.
Olivia totally screwed me
in negotiations.
I won't be working
with her again, but
it should be enough
for a couple of benches out back
for the summer.
Maybe a little vegetable garden
for you to putter ound in.
That'd be nice.
Yeah.
Now, after all these years,
how is it
that you still know so much more
about everything than I do?
I'm the smart one.
{chuckles}
You got the looks, too.
How is that fair?
Ah, thank you.
{laughs} Let's say we
crack open a book, huh?
Okay.
See that-- the
two little bears?
That's you and I.
That's right.
I'm the big one, right?
And I'm the small one.
Yeah, you're the tiny one.
And what does that say?
"I always love you."
"And I will always
love you."
{bell ringing}
{knocks gently}
Hey.
Uh, these are for you.
They're lovely.
Thank you.
{clears throat}
Um... I-I messed up, Emma.
I think,
in all of this
{inhales deeply}
"discovering who I am" business,
I took a couple of wrong turns.
And I get how those detours
might have hurt you.
But now I know
that that's not who I am
or who I want to be.
I know what's supposed
to happen now.
I'm supposed to smile
and be impressed by how in touch
you are with your feelings
and moon over the fact
that you care about me so much,
but, um...
I can't.
But, Emily, th-this is...
this is killing me.
I just...
{sighs}
I want you to look at me
the way you used to.
I can't.
{clears throat}
But you know what,
that's a good thing.
Really, if this relationship
is ever going to work
between the two of us,
we have to start
seeing each other
for who we really are.
Thank you for the flowers.
I know you're behind the Glist.
You have no proof.
I can't believe
that you're going to pin this
on me. I'll be expelled.
I mean, it makes sense.
Everything else
has been taken from me--
my popularity, my body.
Might as well throw away
my education.
You know when I realized
that you did it?
The moment I felt
what it was like
to walk in your shoes.
I mean, it takes years
to build a good reputation,
but only seconds to destroy it.
Couple bad choices,
and you go from the top
to the bottom.
You have lost so much, Quinn.
Which means you had the most
to gain from the Glist.
I never meant to hurt anybody.
I... I was captain
of the cheerleading squad,
president of the Celibacy Club.
I had Finn.
People would part
like the Red Sea when I walked
down the hallway.
Now I'm invisible.
And you think being seen
as a cheap tramp is better?
A bad reputation is better
than no reputation at all.
Look, I know
that high school feels
like your whole life right now,
but it's going to end.
You're going to give
that baby to a family
who really wants it,
who's going to love it,
and then you are going to go on
to do amazing things, Quinn.
You really think that I
can get it all back one day?
{sighs}
No.
I think you can get
something even better.
I mean, come on.
You're Quinn Fabray, right?
I mean, those
people didn't part
when you walked down the halls;
you moved them
with your attitude.
Thanks, Mr. Shue.
You're a really good teacher--
even if everybody
is calling you a man-whore.
FIGGINS:
You wanted to see me,
William?
I trust you
have come up
with the perpetrators
of the Glist.
I, um... I grilled
every single one
of my students,
and, uh... no one.
No one copped
to making the Glist.
They all closed ranks
and wouldn't rat out who did it.
That's poppycock, Will.
I will not let this school
be held hostage
by juvenile shenanigans.
I know, but... I mean,
your point has been made.
The Glists have stopped.
I think we should just
call this a victory
and move on.
Fine.
I'm still praying for you, Will.
Thank you.
{bell ringing}
Hi.
Are you still mad at me?
You know,
before I transferred here
to make you my girlfriend,
I asked around about you,
found out your rep,
what kind of girl you were.
What did they say?
Most of them
had no idea who you were.
The ones that did
said you
were kind of sneaky hot,
but that that quality
was canceled out
by a compulsive need to be right
and a strange affinity
for sweaters
with animals on them.
The most
interesting part was...
that, even though no one
particularly liked you,
they all said you were a person
who could be trusted.
I still am.
I have this pathological need
to be popular, okay?
I... I just want people to think
I'm cool so bad sometimes
that it just clouds
my judgment. Okay?
As a fellow star
in the making, I'm...
I'm sure you
can understand that.
On that level, sure.
But as the guy
who gave up everything
to be your one and only,
I just can't see past this.
I should have been enough
for you, Rachel.
I knew you'd break my heart.
Well, that's the funny thing
about reputations.
Everyone thinks
I'm the big heartbreaker,
but the fact of the matter is...
you broke mine first.
Do me a favor.
If we end up next to each other
on the bar
at Ballet Club this week,
just do your arabesques
and piquÃÂ©s in silence.
Don't talk to me.
