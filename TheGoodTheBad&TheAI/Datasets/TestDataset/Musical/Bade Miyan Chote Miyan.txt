How many times have l told you not
to touch me from behind?
l consider anybody touching me
from behind to be my enemy.
Fortunately l'd brush in my hand.
Had l a knife or pistol
you would have been lying dead.
Tell me, what's the matter?
Party has come to buy weapons and
RDX. May l bring him here tomorrow
No ! Not here.
l never do business from here.
Here l'm a sculptor.
l make beautiful sculptures.
What l hide in them, only l know.
Where will you meet him?
- ln the hotel. ln any room.
What if l'm caught doing
business here.
l'm very fearful of being
beaten by the police.
They hang upside down
and turn stick on you.
l hear two new inspectors
have come.
Arjun Singh and Pyarelal.
Don't know how are they !
What's going on?
Can't you see me
sharpening the saw?
You take me for an idiot !
What is there to take you for?
You are an idiot.
Hey ... ! l know everything.
You are panning to escape -
You must take me too.
Hey, are you out of your mind?
My mind is perfectly sound but if
it goes bad, l start shouting.
Hey, why are you doing that?
- You too can tag along with us.
Why are you being jealous if your
two brothers are trying to escape.
lf three brothers escape together
that will make me very happy.
Do you want to swallow the rice
that we have cooked?
We have worked for four nights
to cut these bars.
And you want ...
- to get out so easily.
Hey Head Constable ... !
- Okay you too come along quietly.
We've come out of the jail.
But the city must have
been cordoned off.
We can't even buy
a change of clothes.
You helped me escape, so it's now
my duty to help you somehow.
Ha ! How can you help us -
Your own brain needs fixing.
l'll take you to my boss who can
send you out of country overnight.
Tell me something about your boss.
- Shall l tell you his name?
Yes !
- Sunder Kala.
Welcome, Karim.
Sundar Kala is proud of his men.
Like a lion my men can
finish the enemies.
And like a bird they can
fly out of the jail.
Look at him. We did all the work
and praise goes to him.
Speak up !
- lt'll take time to explain.
They are very useful.
The helped me escape from jail.
You can keep them.
They are very useful.
Fine ! lf you say, l'll keep them.
You both are appointed.
Boss ! We've been surrounded
by the police.
Don't move !
Nobody should move from his place.
Don't try anything clever
Sundar Kala !
All my men are armed with gun in
hand and a pistol in pocket.
Your men have rifle -
you don't have any !
lt's cheating. You've too !
l've none. Give me one.
Why do you want to blacken your
clean hands by killing him?
l can take care of him for you.
First you jailed us
now you want to jail Sunder !
Give us a chance to show loyalty.
You give these revolvers to us.
You give us order and then see.
- Fine, take this
Now order us.
- Kill him.
Hey Karim ! Have they gone mad ?
Hey what you kids are doing ?
lf you pull the trigger, the brain
of boss will come out of his cap.
We escaped from jail to
catch your boss !
That's why we brought
you here, idiot !
That's cheating !
- lt isn't cheating, it's setting.
But who are these two?
Meet me ! l'm lnspector
Arjun Singh.
And l'm lnspector Pyare Mohan.
You deliberately punched
me all over.
Sundar Kala had his revolvers
aimed at your temples.
Had we not punched you in time,
he'd have shot into your temples
lnstead of warming, your family
would've been weeping by now.
Even if you're getting any warmth
that would be from funeral pyre.
And forgive sir, we'd have been
standing there to salute you.
Why do you keep talking about
the death that hasn't come?
We aren't talking about death -
we are talking about saving you.
We risked our life to save you and
we also caught the criminals.
lnstead of appreciating it you're
weeping over a couple of punches !
Go ! Get out of here and don't
show me your faces.
How can we do that. We get paid
for showing our faces to you.
l beg of you, l give you 2-day
vacation, please go from here.
Don't talk with me.
You're late again.
What can l do. Man l come with
drives jeep like a bullock-cart.
You never come alone. You always
bring some excuses with you.
l think l'd stop seeing you.
- What do you mean.
l mean, l should marry you.
l too want this. But how to
explain this to my brother?
He's growing older, but he
doesn't care what happens to me.
You mean, l can't marry you too.
- Perhaps ... !
What do you mean by perhaps.
Tell your mom to marry him !
What ?
- Your mom should get him married.
lf he gets married -
then l get married.
l'm afraid what your brother will
think if he finds out about us.
He always wrong opinion about me.
Perhaps l'm little big naught ... !
l want to file a complaint
against Arjun Singh.
What is my crime?
He has not yet married.
See ... we're a small happy
family of three members.
My mother, my sister and l.
When the fourth member comes -
who knows what her nature will be.
Will she be able to run this home?
Will she serve my mother or not?
l want to avoid these problems.
You can't escape by
such arguments.
lf every man thinks like him there
would be no marriage in this world
From youth till old age
girls will remain unmarried.
World will end.
After hearing arguments from both
sides, Home Minister concludes ...
that either you select a girl of
your own choice and marry her ...
or l will do that by force.
Look at your age. After sometime
we'll hesitate to ask any girl.
As you like. lf the proceeding is
over, can l get something to eat.
lf you're ready for marriage -
then food is also ready, brother.
lt's so nice food ... !
My respects mom.
Live long. Sit and eat.
- See a mother's heart.
When kids eat - a mother's
heart is delighted.
And there are some people
who become jealous.
How dare you come to this house !
What're you doing -
let him eat.
You live alone Mumbai - you
should always come here to eat.
l think l'd have breakfast too.
lf a man takes good breakfast his
entire day passes pleasantly.
Okay then you should come here
for breakfast every day.
Put a bed for me. l'll leave
for work after breakfast.
Get out ...
l'm being insulted ...
- What're you doing ... ?
lf you love him so much,
have some food sent to his house.
Why do you treat him like this?
What evil do you see in him?
The evil that l see in him,
you can't see ... !
Just a minute ...
You bring my meals.
Very good. Excellent.
You've many good weapons.
But this time it is going to
be a very big order.
How big will be the order?
Ten times bigger than
the last order.
Even if it is twenty times bigger,
Zorawar can easily handle it.
Really ! Superb !
Mr. Zorawar, you've a big bungalow
why do you have meeting in hotel?
Why are hotels meant for?
For meetings among people like us.
Book a room in anybody's name -
and just close the door.
What goes on behind the
closed door - nobody will know.
This room has been booked in the
name of Jamshed.
You'll ask who's Jamshed.
When l don't know -
how will the police know?
l am afraid of the Mumbai police.
They beat with canes.
l am not afraid of death.
l am afraid of the police.
What happened?
- l want to go to bathroom.
Open this door.
- lt has ''Don't disturb'' tab.
Come on, open.
- l can't open.
Don't open the mouth.
Open the door.
What are you doing brother?
Are you watching
a super-hit competition.
What do you want to do?
Want to get me arrested !
Don't you know l'm very
afraid of the police.
Just give me the videocassette.
Zorawar ! This is proof of your
black deeds. You won't be saved.
l've pain in neck so l can't bend.
Give me videocassette - quick.
As long as l am alive
you won't get this cassette.
Maybe l'll take it after
you are dead.
You're lucky.
He was watching it on TV.
You've seen the live telecast.
What should l do to you.
lt is not your age to die.
And your body is too delicate
for putting a bullet in it.
Look ... your confusion and
shaking won't serve any purpose.
A police inspector was
murdered in that hotel.
And l can't forgive the murderer
of my inspector.
Give your complete statement.
- Yes ...
ls this the way to talk
with a girl?
l know our inspector has died,
but this girl is so perplexed ...
l'm taking her statement ...
You first have some water.
Speak up ...
- Yes.
Had l not run, he would
have killed me too.
Don't be afraid.
Police is with you.
We're with you. Don't worry.
lf you see that man again -
can you recognize him?
We're not going to bother
you any more.
Just write your phone
number on this pad.
After we find the murderer,
we'll contact you.
Come on, l'll take you home.
At this time she needs a friend
rather than a police officer.
Don't think you can do it better
than me. You come with me.
Do you live alone in this city?
No sir. My friend Neha lives
with me. Just there ...
So, you live here.
- Yes. My flat is over there.
Okay. l'll now go. When you catch
murderer, call me to recognize him
l helped you, entertained you from
police station to here -
Just to hear this !
- Sorry. Did l say anything wrong?
You broke my heart.
Will we meet only after
we find the criminal?
l don't get you !
Would you mind if l invite you
for tea or dinner? Would you?
Of course not.
You have my phone number.
lf you're afraid or suspect
anyone, give us a call.
Madhu ! Why did you take so long.
l was so worried.
l called you at hotel and found
somebody had been murdered.
A police inspector was in a hotel
room. He was murdered.
Who did it?
l saw the murderer. l went to
police station to report.
How did you come from there?
Pyare dropped me ...
- Pyare ?
Yes ... lnspector Pyare Mohan.
Gem of inspector ! l was
frightened to see the murder ...
but he calmed me and set my mood ...
He was very nice and we
developed good friendship.
He'll phone someday and invite
me for tea or dinner.
You'll eat when you're invited but
l'm starving because of you.
Serve the food - l'll join you.
- Come fast.
Oh my child, my baby, my favorite
kid ... at last l found you dear !
lt has taken burden off my chest.
l searched you everywhere.
And you were reporting to police.
You were giving your statement.
l'm so afraid of police.
He can't sleep. He can't eat.
And you're having nice dinner.
Food is served ...
lt is so tasty.
What are your plans for this girl?
She must be killed.
l've no other choice.
She too understands.
Shall we eat something ?
- Yes, let's eat.
One witness is not yet dead -
another has come to die !
Where did she fall ?
- She ran away.
Go and get her, else she too
will go to police.
Where did she vanish ?
She had a friend, Neha.
Find out where is Neha.
l want to talk with
Pyare Mohan.
He is not here, but you seem to be
worried. Tell me. l can help.
l'll tell Pyare Mohan only ...
- You tell me. Don't hesitate.
l'm Madhu's friend
l've seen her murderer.
Tell me more about ...
- l'll tell Pyare Mohan only.
Pyare Mohan is here.
He just came.
Some girl is calling.
She has witnessed Madhu's murder.
She wants to talk with
Pyare Mohan only.
So, have her talk with Pyare Mohan
Why are you asking me to talk?
You'll talk with her like
Pyare Mohan. That's my order.
Talk like Pyare Mohan.
- Sir, he talks like this.
l could have talked like that !
- Then go ahead and talk.
l'm Pyare Mohan talking ...
- l am Neha, Madhu's friend.
They have killed Madhu.
l want to meet with you.
l want to tell you everything.
Where are you calling from?
Where is she calling from?
Sorry ... Ask her again.
Where are you calling from?
l'm calling from a public booth -
across from Sitara hotel.
Don't worry -
l'm coming right now.
Where is she calling from?
Sir, there is a public booth
across from Sitara hotel ...
You go immediately.
- Sir, send Pyare when he comes.
What if he comes after 2 hours.
- Then what can l o, sir.
Look Arjun Singh ... she is a very
important witness in Madhu's case
Go there as Pyare Mohan - talk to
her in his style. That's my order.
Leave me ... !
You too are that murderer's man -
you have come to kill me.
What are you doing ?
Have you gone crazy ?
l'm lnspector Pyare Mohan.
- How can l believe?
You don't even have a badge !
Okay then. l'm going back
to the police station.
You phone me. l'll pick the phone.
l'll come back again.
No. Please wait ...
l'm very much perplexed.
l don't know who should l
trust and who l should not ?
You trust me. Let's go.
- Where.
To Pyare Mohan's home - sorry,
to my home. You've no danger.
Don't worry. This is a policeman's
home. You're under no danger here.
Wait here. l'll pick up the key.
- Okay.
Sir, Pyare is not home.
- Yes, l know.
l want key to his flat.
Key ! But why?
- Don't ask question.
Key, but why, sir?
- You're questioning again !
Listen. lf Pyare Mohan comes -
don't let him come upstairs.
Okay, l understand.
- What did you understand?
l'd stop him here - shouldn't let
him come up, as you're going up.
Come. You're safe in this house.
Nobody will bother you here.
Because it's a policeman's home.
Nobody will search for you here.
lt's a policeman's home.
lt's very hot here.
- lt's hot. l'll put on the fan.
You turned on the light.
- Oh yes. l turned on the light.
Which one is your bedroom?
- Bedroom ...
ln fact all rooms are my bedrooms.
l live alone. l sleep everywhere.
You can rest in this one.
May l ?
- Yes, by all mean.
Doors at the police station
all open inside.
You've photos of so many girls.
Are they your girlfriends?
No. They aren't my girlfriends.
The are all 'wanted' !
You must be hungry -
l'll get something from kitchen.
Give me the key.
- l can't give you key now.
Why ?
- You can't go upstairs now.
Why can't l go in my home?
Mr. Arjun's order.
He told me to say this to you ...
You're my servant -
Why do you follow his orders.
He has brought a girl.
He said if Pyare comes -
stop him here.
Don't let him come upstairs ...
How many girls has he
brought here before this ?
How can an ugly mind
think of anything nice ?
You can do ugly things but
l can't even think about them !
What face will you
show to ma and Seema?
Now l know why you haven't
married all these years.
She is Neha ...
- So what?
She is eyewitness to
Madhu's murder.
What ?
- Yes. She wanted to meet you.
ln your absence Commissioner made
me Pyare Mohan and sent me to her.
Why did you bring her here?
- Where else could l take her?
They are now after her. l didn't
find any other safe place.
lf she is here, where shall l go?
- l don't know?
l'm doing my duty here. l'll stay
here as Pyare Mohan for few days.
ln that case l'll stay
in your home as Arjun.
No ... !
- Shy not ... ?
l can't keep him in my home.
- Why not ?
Sir, you try to understand !
l've a grown up sister.
What a shame ! lf one unformed
officer can't trust another ...
how will outsiders trust them?
Sir, l trust the uniform -
but not the man wearing it !
Today an inspector doesn't
listen to Commissioner.
When you asked me to stay in his
house, l didn't say a word.
ln that case, l suggest you tell
the truth to Neha.
Don't talk like idiots.
lf she finds you're not Pyare
Mohan she'll lose faith in police.
She'll think police is
playing some game with her.
Until she recognizes murderer this
drama will continue. lt's order.
At last we have arrived here !
Both have come together ! Looks
you've made peace with each other.
l'm going out for a few days.
- All of a sudden !
Policeman's work is always sudden.
l'm going to Delhi
by flight tonight.
How can we live alone.
Somebody should be with us.
Until l come back -
Pyare Mohan will live here.
l can't understand you.
Sometimes you say -
don't let him enter the house.
Now you are asking him
to live here !
Whatever ma. He's our own man.
A policeman can protect another
policeman's family.
How much has improved
in one day.
Seema, pack up some food for me.
- Okay.
You're going by plane.
They will serve you food.
Ma. When l miss you l'll eat
your hand cooked food.
Here is food.
Where would you like to eat?
You have so many photographs.
Who is this man.
He is Arjun Singh.
Who is Arjun Singh?
My friend, my brother,
my everything.
But why his photos are more
than your own photos.
l live here. Where is the need for
putting my photographs.
He doesn't live here. When l miss
him l see his photos.
Come on, have some food.
This looks like home made food
- Yes. lt's from home.
Whose home?
- My home.
l mean, from Arjun Singh's home.
Looks like you love him very much.
- Yes, more than very much.
l love him so much that l think
about him round the clock.
Who knows what he would be doing !
Eat the food.
- Are you feeding a beggar?
Take my name with respect
and say, ''Please eat the food''.
Mohan, eat the food.
Sounds like you're demanding tax.
Say with love, ''Please eat food''
Pyare, eat the food.
Sounds like someone
has thrown a stone.
l've so lovely name. Say hi Pyare,
please eat the food.
Pyare, please eat the food.
l've never seen such contrived
form of love in life.
Anyway, l will eat now.
- No, l'll feed with my own hands.
You both brother and sister
show contrived form of love.
Tell me. lf a boy and girl like
you and me want to spend life ...
together in one home in one room
what should they do?
l will ask my brother.
- You took wrong person's name.
Why does he always come
between our love.
What are you doing ?
- Nothing !
Leave me.
- Seema.
What happened? Have you cold?
- l think you've used my perfume.
l live in you home, naturally
l'll use some of your things.
l too live in your home, l never
use any of your things.
Calling home.
Hello darling.
How are you? l know you didn't
sleep last night.
Feeling sleepy.
l too.
l got to perform my duty.
What? Your brother?
Why should l be afraid of him?
Haven't you heard =
if you love - don't be afraid.
Hello, Seema.
- Nobody was there ... !
Where were you lost?
l got phone from police station -
l'm having nightmare since then.
l'll make a phone call.
Leave me ... ...
- lf l hold a hand, l never leave.
What are you doing?
- Something l always wanted to do.
Somebody might come ... ...
- Who'll come ... ...
your mother is always sleeping.
And your brother isn't here.
Where are you going?
- A girl's modesty is in danger.
Hey you ! Why were you coming
like thieves from the roof?
This is my house ...
l may enter my house from roof or
window or door - it's my choice?
Do you doubt me?
- No, l don't.
On the oath of your uniform -
you aren't messing with my sister.
Not until now, but the way you're
blaming, l think l should do ...
What're you thinking ...
- To make you my brother-in-law ...
Let's go to some disco
Let's go out for dinner''
Sir, send me back to my home
and Pyare Mohan to his home.
Now l won't allow Pyare Mohan
to live in my home.
Look Arjun, not only Pyare Mohan
your sister too loves him.
Sir, she is innocent.
- But she is an adult.
And l know although you're hard on
him, but you too like Pyare Mohan.
You haven't found about murderer -
perhaps you too have affair with ...
What do you mean?
Are you swimming, baby?
We too had to swim in cold water
because of you.
He has cold.
What if he gets pneumonia?
She's so stupid. Lives in a
policeman's home instead our home.
By living with us you'd have saved
your life and you'd have fun too.
There she has only tall man. Here
you can have fun with me, with him.
Now tell quickly what should we
do with her. l'm very cold.
We've to kill her.
She too knows about that.
Hey ! Where are you going?
What are you doing?
What happened ... ?
Who is he?
- He ... ?
No, not that one ...
- Why did you point to him?
What're you doing. He isn't that !
l brought you to recognize a man.
You're so confused !
Can't you recognize a face?
- l can recognize.
Then why don't you recognize?
- Should l recognize a wrong one?
l'm already disturbed and you
shout over me. l'm leaving.
Where are you going? Neha ...
lt's not good to be so angry ...
l don't want to talk - why are you
after me? l don't know you.
lf you don't know him -
then try to know us ...
Let's go home.
- Why?
lt's not time for pranks -
these goons are after me.
These are goons ! No.
The look fine people
Hey tall man.
Leave the girl and run from here.
See. How decently they talk.
- You move your tongue too much.
Brother, not only tongue -
Sometimes l move my hands too.
See how decent are these people.
The don't even talk.
Unnecessarily made me beat them.
Let's go.
- Where?
We will go home.
- Unnecessarily you're after me.
This had to happen one day.
What had to happen has happened''
Pyare ! Dear Arjun Singh -
How are you?
My dear. How are you.
We have met after so many days.
Won't you hug me?
- Let's go out to talk.
He has just come. Let him have tea
- He doesn't drink tea.
l drink coffee.
l'm craving to talk with you.
l'll take care of all your
craving outside.
Why outside?
You can talk with him here
You love him so much -
you have put his photos all over.
He looks good in photos
not in home. Come.
Come on Neha, let's go out.
- Neha won't come.
Why not?
- See. That's why l complain about
He has put me in this jail.
Never takes me out.
Now l've come.
l'll take you out, promise.
This is my case.
- Since when we became different.
Helping one another is duty of
every police officer.
l don't need your help.
l'll handle this case myself.
Are you ready to handle this case?
- l don't understand.
Unless two parties agree
love doesn't flourish.
Do you love him?
- Eyes down - means yes.
Do you love her?
What nonsense !
- Come on Neha.
Neha won't come.
- Do you love her.
What nonsense.
Say it else you lose age
so shall you lose this girl.
Yes ... !
Sir, looks you're taking her.
l mean taking her out.
Seema, how will this
card be for Pyare.
Not Pyare -
Say lnspector Pyare Mohan.
Call your would be brother-in-law
with respect.
You mentioned Pyare Mohan -
Does he really love you?
Yes.
- And l too love him very much?
What happened?
- He has affair with me too.
What? Brother was right ...
Pyare isn't trustworthy.
He has been cheating us both.
How many more girls will he cheat?
What did he do ?
He has played with our hearts.
On one hand he showed
false love to me.
On the other hand he showed
false love to me.
He has cheated both of us.
Let me call Pyare Mohan.
Did you call me, sir ?
Do you know them ?
He isn't Pyare Mohan.
He is Arjun.
He is Pyare Mohan.
Arjun Singh is my brother.
Seema doubts me because of you.
Do something.
Why did you lie that you aren't
Arjun, you're Pyare Mohan?
Cool down madam.
We lied because of you.
Because of me?
l told him to meet you as Pyare.
You're adamant to talk with
Pyare and no one else.
Couldn't you tell the truth
afterwards ?
l told him to lie to you.
You're a liar.
l don't want to talk with you.
l too don't want to
support a liar.
Pyare, do something !
Sir, you help us in this situation
- Yes, l'll.
l think there should be
a song in this situation.
Give me your heart ...
And take my heart in return ...''
Better late than never.
You've fulfilled my desire
to see my daughter-in-law.
From today, you'll live here.
Yes, a daughter-in-law was needed
in home after Seema is gone.
Ma needs come companion.
Where is Seema going ?
- Won't she be married ?
Only if we find a suitable boy ?
No mischief, brother-in-law.
- Don't be abusive.
lf you want to call me bro-in-law
then you first get married.
What are you conspiring about?
- Nothing ma.
Nothing ?
Ma knows everything.
Even when she is asleep -
she keeps her eyes open.
Nothing can go on in this home
without my knowledge.
l've always liked Pyare.
Good that l got a daughter-in-law
as well as a son-in-law.
May God always keep you happy and
never let you face any difficulty.
A car is coming ...
May l go and crash with it.
Go and crash.
But be careful.
Won't you exhort something ?
- Sure. But be careful.
Won't you exhort something ?
- Sure. But be careful.
Oh my God. He's same policeman !
You hit the policeman, idiot.
Oh my younger brother.
Come out you bastard -
look what have you done ... !
l'm sorry. lt was a mistake.
Please listen ...
- What can you say?
You've killed this man.
Don't you know how to drive?
Please don't drag us to police -
let's settle here.
How do you want to settle?
- Tell us what do you want?
Elder brother ! Light is going
away from my life.
l can't see.
- He can't see.
l am dying brother ... !
- Don't die brother.
Take this money.
Take him to some hospital.
Money is okay for hospital -
Who'll give doctor's fee
This is for the doctor -

He asked, which Jonga ... ?
Now you'll have to buy it.

own Jonga. l was angry.
l told him not to mess with
Sharafat Ali.
After that day l established

and sell those to him.
Gradually l took over the
thieves market.
Today his shop doesn't have

But some day in Sharafat Ali's
shop Taj Mahal will be sold.
This is the list of their goods.

Madhuri who shall she marry?

When l went there -
Madhuri was on my chest.
She started crying.
But l thought - l am a thief.

Seema ! Many happy
returns of the day.
You were borne today and

Neha wished me early morning.
- What should l do ... !
Wait. Let me put something

Are you joking? You took the
necklace half an hour ago.
What nonsense?
- lt's not nonsense, sir.
By God, l had given you the
necklace in presence of everyone.
Why don't you say something?
Why all of you are quiet?
So, you've already prepared
your witnesses.
Do you know punishment for
cheating and lying to a policeman?
You're lying. Taking advantage of

But l'll take it from you.
lt was a necklace of Rs.100,000.
How does it look brother?
- She called me brother.
And she is showing it too?

We will carry her.
Give my darling, please give me ...
Take my love in return, take it...
Who can that be?
- You look.
There is nobody.
lt is only a looking glass.
Yes, indeed.
But we're in Kurtas.
On the other end they're in uniform

We are out, and he is n lockup !
Which police station did he go?
Why don't you go ahead of me?
Are you taking me, or am l?

Sir, he is Sharafat Ali.
He was caught buying stolen goods.
Hey constable. By God you've
brought me to right place.

This uniform has made you

Now l get it. You're slapping

But you slap me lightly -
l will cry very loudly.
Why are thrashing me for real?
Tell me who you buy from
and where do you sell?
lf l tell truthfully,
you too will be in a problem.
Will l be in a problem?
He is punching unabated.
l think l'll have to
speak the truth.
Hey listen everybody -
l buy stolen goods from him.
Do you buy from me ?
- Yes. You sell stolen goods to me.
Lock him up.
Don't give him food for two days.
That will teach him a lesson.
You seem upset.
- He says l sell stolen goods.
When did you start?
Who is speaking?
Get read for promotion.

A big smuggling deal is being
planned near Mulund crossing.

You said put him in the lockup.
- When did l say that?
Cool down.
He might have said that.
Didn't he say?
- Yes.
Now l say, let him go.
But sir, you said to put
him in the lockup.
You stay back. He has already
beaten. Maybe now it's your turn.
Why do you talk like this.
Maybe it makes you happy.
He slapped my cheeks
like punching bag.
What are you saying Sharafat?
How can l dare punch you?
Not once, but many times.
Ask them. They were laughing.
Were you laughing?
Don't say no.
l don't like to hear no.
l'm a very rigid police officer.
You haven't seen my temper yet.
Who caught dacoit Mohar Singh?
l was on vacation that day.
You tell me.
- l had gone out for collection.
You tell me.
- By God, l didn't catch him.
What about you.
- l can't speak, l am dumb.
Really. lf you are dumb
then l don't have hands.
They are refusing to admit as if
l am going to blame them.
ln fact l caught the
dacoit Mohar Singh.
When l went out to catch Mohar
Singh, a fierce chase took place.
He was running ahead,
l followed him in my jeep.
His feet got hurt
and came in my hand.
l invited him to sit in my jeep.
l told him ...
You run when road is good
so that l can catch you.
On good road l asked him to
run again.
That road ended in a jungle.
l followed him on foot
in to a swamp.
Mohar Singh jumped out to
other end of swamp.
When l tried to jump
l go caught into the swamp
l was being drawn into the swamp.
l was all-alone.
No animal, no man, not even a bird.
Gradually l was going deep
into the swamp.
What are you looking.
lt's a matter of being afraid.
l didn't know how to save myself.
Suddenly l'd an idea.
l went to a nearby village.
l bought a rope, pulled myself
out and came back here.
You talked too much. Sharafat is
out. Before they come. Let's run.
Take me with you.
lf anybody asks for me -
tell him l'll be in my home.
lf there were few more policemen
like you lndia's prisons will be ...
and all criminals will be free.
Trust me, sir. l had locked up
Sharafat Ali.
You mean they are lying.
- Yes sir.
No sir, we're telling the truth.
Sir, he made us say whatever
he wanted us to say.
He slapped if we said no.
- Pyare always seconded him.
They are obviously lying -
but l don't know why !
Arjun was telling us stories.
l will ...
- You shut up. You speak.
He used cane to make us agree
to whatever he said.
He said he caught
dacoit Mohar Singh.
And said, never say no.
You arrested Mohar Singh. You can't
arrest an ordinary criminal.
How can you arrest Mohar Singh.
l've decided to give you
one last chance.
You know 1/2 Kohinoor diamond is
in England ...
and the other 1/2 has come
back to lndia.
That 1/2 is kept in museum
so people may see it.
l've decided to put you on
duty in that museum.
lf anything goes wrong don't say
that sir, we were not there.
Don't worry, we'll protect the
diamond more than our own life.
This is 1/2 of Kohinoor. Steal it
for me. l'll give your asking price
l read it'll be on public display
after a few days.
lt'll be delivered to you as
soon as it is displayed.
Every time you forget my tea.
- l'll bring it. Why do you pinch.
What do you want?
- What do you have?
All these things.
What should l bring for you?
Bring two plates of everything.
Two plates?
Are more people coming?
We are enough.
- Will two of you eat all that?
Are you eating for
the first time in life?
What is happening?
Perhaps Commissioner is losing
brain along with his hair.
Bring the food l ordered.
- How can l. They ate everything.
There is nothing left in the
kitchen except myself.
Put salt and pepper over me
and eat.
Bring some tea.
- How many dozens?
What's happening? We're two -
we'll take two cups of tea.
l'll see if there is any.
Chances are very remote.
What's happening?
- lt is a challenge.
By assigning security of diamond,
commissioner has given a challenge.
Who ordered the tea.
- You asked me to bring tea.
We don't drink tea.
We drink milk.
Or we take milk pudding.
Go, brink milk pudding.
Why are you bothering.
Better take the tea.
Kohinoor diamond will be brought to
the museum today.
lt will be displaced
to the public tomorrow.
l think we should inspect the
security today.
Here is the milk pudding.
What is this brother.
- l knew you'll say this.
Didn't you say bring milk-pudding.
- We said tea not milk-pudding.
l'll go crazy.
Hey, come here.
Here is your tea.
Give me Rs.1080.
What? Rs.1080?
One cup of tea for Rs.540 !
- Kadir Bhai.
Why have you been calling me?
They aren't paying for the
food they ate.
Are you harassing the kid
with your police uniform?
Should a call Shyamu.
Who is Shyamu?
- Your Commissioner, Shyamlal.
He is my childhood buddy.
No. Don't phone the Commissioner.
We'll give you the money.
What is happening?
Take out the full amount -
and his tip too.
Who is the security in-charge?
So What?
l'm the in-charge of this museum.
Security of diamond is
my responsibility.
l'll let you in after
investigating your right and left.
Will you investigate us?
- So What?
Even thieves wear police uniforms
these days.
Come in.
- Seems crazy.
Did you see the arrangement?
Yes we saw the inside arrangement.
We'll do the outside security.
You came back again !
What do you want now?
We've come to inspect security
of the diamond.
But you just now inspected.
- So what?
Don't you eat twice a day?
Don't you watch TV or wife twice?
We may see twice or 1000 times.
Your duty is to show. Show it.
Okay, come in.
Open the door.
We've put cameras all around.
Anyone approach the diamond
will be photographed.
What's so special about it.
Anybody can dodge the cameras.
lf anybody touches the showcase -
all alarms will start ringing.
Did you see the function of alarms.
Guards, don't worry. This was a
demonstration.
lnspection of security.
No need to worry.
Similarly, if anybody picks up the
diamond, the alarms will go on.
A strong light will be beamed
from here to that cage above.
And the cage will fall on
the head of the thief.
Oh, if the cage falls the thief
will become an omelet.
There is a spot in the diamond.
- So what?
There is a cut in the diamond.
Cut in the diamond ! What do you
say? Want to give me heart attack.
Can't you see cut in the diamond?
- What? What are you talking?
Can't you see cut in the diamond?
Put your head above diamond.
- Face and diamond on same level.
Now l'll slowly move the diamond.
Relax. A demonstration is in
progress inside.
Don't move your head.
- Why?
lf you move, a light beam will
strike the cage above.
And the cage will come down.
Then your head will become
a half-fried omelet.
That's what l told you.
Oh why did you get me caught here.
What a shameful act. You've
brought shame to police department.
l sent you for security of diamond.
And you have stolen it.
Sir, it's false allegation.
We were on duty outside.
How can we go in to steal it.
Perhaps you don't know that there
were cameras inside.
And your idiotic faces have come
in cameras when you were stealing.
How can this happen, sir.
Why don't you believe us.
Sir, we have not stolen.
No, you didn't steal.
Your ghosts came to steal it.
Until today l've forgiven your
small and big mistakes.
l covered them. But today's
mistake can't be forgiven.
You must be punished.
l suspend you.
Until the diamond is found
you will remain in jail.
Why did you call so early.
We rushed without taking bath.
We know the museum is open.
We'll steal and give you diamond.
lt has already been stolen.
- What?
Yes. That's why l tell
you to read the newspaper.
This is Mulayam's picture.
Pyare Mohan and Arjun Singh.
Good. They have done our job.
We fear police but not so much that
we can't get diamond from them.
Who are you?
- l don't know my own identity.
Your brother has caused
to much trouble for me.
Out of fear l can neither sit
at home nor walk on streets.
So l've taken shelter
in your car.
l'm sure you'll save me from
your brother. Won't you?
Good kids are never obstinate.
- Move inside.
lf my brother comes to know,
he will take you to task.
We want your brother to know.
Do you want to get me killed.
Come over here.
This is not a diamond !
This is a bomb !
lf you help us sell -
we will get some money.
Entire Thieves Bazaar will be
sold out but not this diamond.
Why? What is its value.
- Crores.
l like this diamond.
Have it cut. l want a ring.
Have you gone crazy. Where to
sell. Give some idea.
l know a man. Outwardly he is
an sculptor.
He buys stolen goods at
international level.
His name is Zorawar.
Only he can give its price.
You got your diamond -
give us our money.
That too in cash and quickly.
We got to move from here.
l got the diamond.
Where is the heroine?
Which heroine.
- Heroine. Neha !
What nonsense. We don't know Neha.
- You mean, Neha isn't with you?
When we said we don't know -
means we don't know.
Bring out the baby.
Brother !
- Brother !
Did you recognize?
- Face looks familiar.
She is inspector's sister.
Brother, save me.
Look mister. She is neither my
sister, nor l'm her brother.
You mean this girl isn't
your sister.
How many times do l have
to say this.
ls this man your boss?
- Yes
ls he idiot, blind or deaf?
- Can't hear, understand or see !
See. Even your brothers don't
care about your modesty.
Don't blame me.
Do it.
She is our sister.
We are bringing Neha.
But don't do anything to Neha.
Welcome. So you got the
real culprit.
We knew sir that someday
you'll repent for your action.
You look very disturbed.
Neither l got the real culprit -
nor do l repent.
l've come to tell you
that your sister Seema ...
What happened to Seema ?
- What has happened to Seema, sir?
Somebody has kidnapped Seema.
- What ... ?
Please, sir free me from
here for one day.
After finding Seema we shall
put ourselves in your hands.
l'm worried about Seema too.
She is like my own daughter.
l've notified all police stations
and blocked all roads.
No harm will be done to Seema.
But sir, who're the kidnappers -
what do they want?
What if something happens to Seema.
- Nothing will happen to Seema.
Hey baldly. Why these dry hiccups?
lf you can't see - open second eye.
Haven't you seen Ram aur Shyam with
Dilip Kumar in double roll.
We too saw for first time
in your home.
Whatever bad has happened in your
life - we were behind that.
We stole the diamond too.
- Where is the diamond?
We came out by giving them
the diamond.
Now they want Neha to
release Seema.
Did you have any twin brothers?
- No sir.
Lost in childhood.
- No sir.
Lost in a fair.
- Absolutely not.
Where have they come from.
- By grace of God, on public demand
Your good luck has sent
us to release your sister.
This is Zorawar's hideout.
We'll come dancing from stairs here
We'll keep them entertained.
You feed them some intoxicants.
When shall we enter?
-When we finish singing we'll say ...
You enter by breaking
this glass window.
Look. l too will come with you.
What if you run away.
We are helping and this baldly
uncle is doubting us.
We won't help you.
Better catch them alone.
Wait a minute. Don't mind. Sit.
lf you sing and dance -
l too would like to sing and dance.
Please take me ...
Hey brother. Do you remember
when you have to enter.
They were to enter at this point.
- Haven't come.
l told you don't trust them.
Start singing. He's coming.
- Clear up your throat.
You dance quite well.
Do you think we are stupid.
You thought we will be down
with tiny bit of drugs.
This much we normally
eat with our breakfast.
No one else will dance.
Now only these two will dance.
You think you're Mughal-e-Azam
and we are Anarkali.
How much can we dance.
lf you like we'll come to dance
everyday - morning and evening.
But let us go now.
Start dancing else
l'll put the bullet in you.
lt is wrong. ln olden times dancers
were rewarded with gold and silver...
You're showing us gun -
so we won't dance.
You've done enough. Let's go
respectfully soon, else ...
Otherwise what will you do?
What will we do ... !
We will dance.
You did typically like policemen.
Why don't you ever come in time?
We almost died dance. Had you
delayed more you'd see dead bodies.
You didn't die.
We came before that.
Why do you come in end? Why not
early. You always come in end.
And you're talking as if you
have obliged us by coming.
Let them go. We aren't going
to spend all life with them.
We're going. Forgive our
misbehavior. Goodbye.
Hey! Why are you ogling your eyes.
They are thieves, we're policemen.
Don't be surprised. He is not your
man. That's over there.
That day you picked me from the
jeweler's shop.
And then after the cake in your
home, the food, the dance ...
Now how can l thank you.
You were not my brother -
yet you saved my life.
Why are you embarrassing me.
ln fact we've nobody in this world.
That day when you affectionately
called me as your brother ...
My heart felt music of many strings
So l felt l must help you.
ln fact we did good deeds in
confusion. We aren't really good.
Why is our van going separate
way from others?
Are we being taken to
some special jail.
What happened.
Why did you stop the van.
There are two dead bodies ahead.
We aren't dead bodies.
We got tired waiting.
Just give us a ride
to the railway station.
Doesn't the man standing inside
look like Zorawar.
He is actually Zorawar. Shameless
man has again cheated the police.
He is always coming in our way.
Those who like to be punched -
come to me.
Those who prefer to be kicked
go to him.
Did you play with him.
Now come, play with me.
Do you remember faintly?
- Yes l remember.
These bastards had made
us dance too much.
Now we'll be Mughal-e-Azam
- and they'll be Anarkali.
So everybody has been caught.
But the real criminal you took army
to catch is missing.
Sir, we had locked him in the van.
lf you had locked him in the van
then how did he get out.
Sir, you got the diamond.
- So should l leave real criminal.
l don't how did Zorawar vanish.
Here is Zorawar.
But where are you people going?
lndia is a big country.
We'll do our business elsewhere.
What if l make arrangement
for your livelihood.
ls he proposing to
take us into the jail?
God has blessed you with good mind
which you use for stealing.
Use that brain for serving the
country and the law.
Will you work for the police?
Where are you going?
As a policeman you're
showing hand to policemen.
Sorry sir, we made mistake.
These two look familiar.
- Yes. Who are you.
The van you're moving in
used to be our van.
And the uniform you are wearing
used to be on our bodies.
Why are they talking so
insultingly with us.
Haven't you learnt manners
to talk with your officers?
lf you talk like this again l'll
make you run naked in the desert.
And remember. We're very hard.
Never say no to us.
