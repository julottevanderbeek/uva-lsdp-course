The water canal has reached
our village, Mother.
The villagers want you
to inaugurate it.
She refuses! You are our mother,
the mother of the whole village!
Either you inaugurate it
or it will remain untouched!
Mother, please...
I speak the truth.
The wedding was so grand that
everybody is talking about it.
Of course. God has blessed
me with just one son.
Nobody in our village holds
a torch to the bride in beauty.
Of what use is mere beauty?
She should be talented, too.
If God desires, she will be.
I've heard something...
The villagers would say...
Why have you stopped? Go on.
Aunt, please don't feel offended.
People say that you have mortgaged
your land for the wedding.
Mortgaged my land!
Let them say that in front of me!
I'll knock their teeth out!
What hasn't God given me?
Don't I possess land?
Plow? Bullocks?
I've mortgaged land!
Why are the villagers jealous?!
My foot!
I have mortgaged the land.
If I wouldn't, how could
I celebrate the marriage?
Who doesn't do it?
If the bride is fortunate enough,
we'll get it released, too.
She does look lucky.
Let me do something.
Fine. You do it.
What have you done? A new bride
and you've removed your jewelry!
Think of me, if not yourself.
I haven't yet seen you properly.
- Wear them.
- Sell them.
- Are you mad?
- It will lighten the burden.
What burden?
Mother has mortgaged the land.
That's a pack of lies!
The villagers make up stories!
And even if she has, I'll throw the
money in the lender's face very soon!
Somebody will see!
Mother might come. Let go.
- So what?
- Won't you feel shy?
Dump the shame in your basket!
- I wish mother comes.
- Let her.
I swear... they look good on you.
I pray that they always remain
in my hands for you to see.
Why won't they when I'm around?
Then I'll take them off everyday.
So you can put them on.
Shameless man!
Are you the only man in the
village to have got married?
Anybody who sees this
will spit at you!
And you too, daughter-in-law!
What can I say...
Why should I blame you?
His father too was like him.
Look at this! Light the fire first.
What are you cooking? Your head?
Don't drop it.
Listen...
Don't let him come too close.
Stop it.
He'll become worthless.
Dear Kamla, walk carefully
lest your foot slips.
- This is a woman's foot
not a man's. - Let's go.
You are offended. I meant the pot.
It's an earthen pot. Might break.
With you alive, who can have
a copper pot on their heads?
I want you to have pots
made of gold on your heads.
But nobody cares. What times!
Why are you arguing
with him? Let's go.
Go and rinse your mouth.
It stinks!
- Who is he?
- The village grocer.
But he has a wicked heart.
We'll go together with lunch.
You've come. Shamu's Radha has come
You really take very long!
Sit down.
I think you should come here
with me in the morning itself.
- And lunch?
- Don't worry about food.
You are all I need.
Delicious!
- You cook very well.
- Is the salt okay?
Don't talk about salt.
You must only touch food.
Everything will turn salty. You
don't know how salty your hands are!
Where? See...
The salt of the entire
village is in your hands!
I swear. Let me see...
In two days your henna has faded.
- So what?
- Nothing? You don't understand.
A new bride shouldn't work
so hard. I feel hurt.
New bride? It's 2 days
since we got married.
It's not a few years!
Remain spruced for 2 months.
This time won't return.
Let the other brides be jealous.
Keep away. Somebody might watch us.
- Nobody will see us.
- Let me go.
This is a big problem!
At home, you're scared of mother;
And here, the world! Are we sinning?
Then the kids will come by!
You're already counting the kids?
- When God gives us the day...
- Gives? Of course He will.
When we have children...
A couple won't do. I need
One for each corner.
Shambhu? Just wait!
What's the matter?
Shameless!
Come and take some grains.
I'm very happy today.
You also come and take some.
What are you doing?
You also take some.
Be a little patient.
You're not the only one to
become a father. Hold back.
What do you know of the
joy of the birth of a son?
You also take some.
Aunt!
Your voice sounds as it were
coming from a torn drum!
- First congratulate us.
- You're worried about wishes?
And your son is ruining me!
He's destroying the crop!
If he must, let him
distribute his own share.
Why is he touching my share?
- Three fourths is our share.
- You keep forgetting.
- Three parts are mine.
- What? - Of course.
- Three are mine!
- No, mine.
This is cheating.
Get us to put our
thumb-impression on anything!
I'll complain to the Panchayat!
Think and decide, brothers.
I help you in times of need.
Till the principal amount
of rupees 500 is not paid...
...3 parts of my crop of jowar
and pulses will go to...
...the moneylender as interest.
- Hear that?
And here is her thumb impression.
Now tell the Village Council that
this is not your thumb-impression!
God knows what nonsense you write!
Talk of what we spoke.
I believe in spoken words.
Didn't you say that one part of the
crop will be yours and 3 ours?
Giving her due respect for
her age, I was being lenient.
I gave her the money.
I couldn't even lift the bag.
If you'll hang me for this,
I'll go straight to court!
Who is afraid of courts?
The courts are fair.
You'll be jailed instead!
Listen to him!
He'll have me jailed!
If I don't get the police and
claim the land, I'm not man enough!
No, the police should
never enter our village!
- Decide the issue here and now.
- What do you say?
The police mustn't come here.
Then you decide this.
What do you decide?
If it's the written word,
then you have to give it.
Make Shamu also put his
thumb impression on this.
One can't trust this old lady.
She's alive today. She may die soon.
You'll die with your family!
I'll go only after you're dead!
You bullied the Council
into deciding in your favor!
You're cheating my kids!
I pray to God to punish you!
As long as I live, my son won't put
his thumb impression! Let's go.
- Don't give him.
- Why?
- He hasn't made me a catapult.
- I'll make it. Don't be angry.
What is going on?
Whom did you think this
belongs to? Beggars!
- Put it back!
- He won't.
The son is one step ahead
of his father!
Now, my boy...
This has my share, too.
You didn't plow the field.
I've plowed 500 bucks
in your father's life.
- Come here.
- What is it?
You're a thief!
- A thief?
- Yes.
- Yes. You are a thief!
- Stay away!
If I get angry, you've had it!
Go and stop him.
Doesn't matter. Let him be.
My umbrella costing 5.50!
I swear I'll add this money also
to your account! Remember that!
He's ruined my umbrella!
- Give it to him.
- My umbrella!
Return it.
Throwing it away? I've added
Your son would have
thrashed that man today.
Grandma is a liar!
- I was going to beat Ramu.
- But why?
- He asked me to steal jaggery.
- He stole it, not me!
- Why...
- Sit down!
He's a devil!
Don't call me a devil.
I'll fight back.
- Mother, I'll eat with you.
- Me, too.
Tell us a story!
All right. Once upon a time,
there used to be a mouse.
- He had four tails.
- Don't tell lies!
A mouse does not have 4 tails.
It has just one.
I'll tell you a story
about a lion.
I strangled its neck...
He started limping.
Then I sat astride the horse.
And I escaped...
And I find a lion. I pick
it up and carry it home.
And I pet it gently.
Then he dies.
Then I bring another lion
and keep it in another house.
Then a mouse comes slowly...
And I kill it.
Don't stop. Learn it fast.
- Sir.
- Greetings.
You've brought the younger one too.
That's very nice.
People say education
makes a man soft hearted.
They just say it.
Am I soft hearted?
Teach him carefully or
he'll teach you some things.
Don't you worry. I have
set many rascals right.
Teach him that much...
...that he is able to read
all the money lender's books.
Even the English
can't read his books.
- I'll read them!
- Go and sit in your place.
Don't punish my child.
Without that, one can't
gain any knowledge.
I must have been punished
at least 250 times.
Only then have I learnt a little.
It's essential to be punished.
Thank God we are not educated
or he would have punished us too!
Look at him!
Get up! Why are you bent over?
What are you doing here?
Go and sit in your seat.
- I know everything!
- What do you know?
Go to your place!
Why are you beating my brother?
Standing up for his brother!
First you bend over!
Bend like a chicken!
Put away the catapult!
You're punishing my brother!
I won't spare you!
Remain bound till morning.
If you give him dinner,
I'll be really angry with you!
Beats somebody!
Throws somebody's turban!
Throws stones! What is this?
The moon sits faraway
and eats in a plate.
Grandma dies.
Father got scared.
Grandma will die!
- You'll sleep hungry tonight.
- Mother will give me dinner.
Give you dinner! Daughter-in-law...
If you feed him, I'll tie you
up in his place. Be warned!
She's gone to sleep.
Get my dinner.
No dear. Leave my legs.
- Go and untie him.
- Whom?
- Your son.
- Let him be.
It's so late. Go and untie him
and give him something to eat.
What's the hurry? I'll give it.
What a mother you are! In your
place I'd have fed him hours ago.
- He's eating.
- Eating?
You gave him food without asking me!
- Am I dead?
- Grandma is dead!
- What are you eating?
- Grams with jaggery.
What's your name?
Get lost! That's a boy's name.
Should I tell you the truth?
My name is Rupa.
What madness is this?
He's just a child.
He's stealing the grams from
the girl's hands! Robbery!
Give it back to her.
I want to talk to you.
Give him some jaggery.
Here. Come in.
There's a month or so before
the crop can be harvested.
I wanted a quintal of jowar.
There's nothing to eat at home.
So you eat me.
I swear I'm fed up
of giving you loans.
No sign of paying back
what you've already taken.
Don't you take 3 parts of our crop?
That's the interest.
The principal is as it is.
Should our kids starve to death?
Let not the kids starve.
What have you brought to pawn?
To pawn? Don't you trust me?
It's not that. If you ask for
a kilo or so I won't think twice.
But a quintal! Don't feel hurt
but I'm sitting here for business.
I have a motherless child to rear.
I have to collect money for her.
If nothing else, your
daughter-in-law has ornaments.
- Don't you dare talk of her!
- All right. I won't.
You have some copper
and bronze vessels?
- Yes!
- Then get them.
Tell your mother
to give the vessels.
To throw at his face!
I won't give them! He's a thief!
I won't give them! He's a thief!
In what will we cook?
And store water?
He says he'll give the grain
only if we give our vessels.
- Give it.
- I don't want his grain!
- Give it son.
- I won't! It's my plate!
If you don't give this plate,
your father will sleep hungry.
Ramu will be hungry.
Your grandma will be hungry.
My mother will also starve.
Will you also starve?
I don't want it.
Come down and have lunch.
- I don't want it. You eat.
- Got a little late.
The fire wouldn't light.
- Begged for grain?
- No, don't say that.
Why not? I say you shouldn't
have brought food today!
- You would have been hungry.
- So what? God would feel ashamed.
Gives us birth but doesn't feed us!
Eat something.
So the vessels have
reached the money lender!
I have thought of a plan.
We have 5 acres of land...
It's lying barren with only grass.
We'll cultivate it.
The money lender doesn't own it.
Is it easy to break that land?
Half the land is full of stones
and the other half with thick roots!
My oxen will die in 2 days.
The oxen will die later.
First the moneylender will kill us.
I'll start breaking the land
right from tomorrow.
I had told you this land
is only full of boulders!
You are so broken hearted
just because an ox died?
I'm not dead. I can
always lend you 100 bucks.
I believe if man can't help
another, I'd rather shoot him!
- Aunt!
- You be quiet mother!
- If you don't leave, you've had it.
- What crime have I committed?
Am I a thief? A dacoit?
Leave him!
- He will die!
- Let him!
Let him go!
He's killed me!
Thank God nobody saw.
Be prepared for tomorrow. I'll
confiscate your field, house, ox...
Then call me a sweeper
not a money lender!
I'll strip the clothes
off your back!
- Give me my turban!
- Your father is a rat!
Return my turban! You rat!
- Give it back!
- You rat!
- Return it.
- I won't!
Doesn't matter. Are you watching?
I'm taking this as a remembrance.
I say, murderer!
If you treat him like this,
how will we survive?
- He's no God!
- Not God?
Then ask your God for another ox.
With what face can I
now ask him for money?
Why do you need to beg for money?
Let everyone die like the ox died!
Let everyone die!
You are very arrogant!
- We eat thanks to him!
- I'll burn such food!
- No!
- Move aside!
- Leave it!
- My kids are hungry!
My children are hungry!
Get an ox with this.
Well done.
Good Radha. Almost done.
A little more.
Shambhu! Uncle!
Help! Uncle!
Anybody there?
It would have been
better if I had died!
- God forbid!
- I should've died!
What's the point in such a life?
I will tolerate the harshest
sunlight in your shadow.
For God's sake don't say that!
Smoke mine father.
Smoking? Kids don't smoke.
- You must not smoke.
- I'll never smoke Dad.
Here you smoke.
I'll roll joints for you.
And you smoke. No problem.
- Daughter-in-law!
- Wait. I'm coming.
- Call your mother.
- Mother!
Mother, I'll help you...
Mother!
Good God!
Why are you giving the oxen
this dirty water to drink?
Take the oxen to our well.
No. Don't do this.
Why not?
What will you do with them?
You'll have to sell them.
Was my money worthless...?
You'll never be happy.
Don't take curses from my kids.
I have no arms.
No hands and no shame!
Kids are starving and
you live off your wife!
Shameless! Darken your face and
sit on the village outskirts.
Live off charity like a stray dog!
Take the oxen!
I won't let you take them! No!
Tie a bell round my neck!
And turn me into an ox.
Oh! I forgot...
Tie this in his neck.
Give this too to the money lender.
You have no hands and no shame.
The kids are starving and
you live off your wife!
If you must live, live on charity.
Mother!
I knew it!
- What did you know?
- I knew he wouldn't take it.
I knew it! I knew it would happen!
Daughter-in-law!
Your vermilion!
No mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Mother what's wrong?
Didn't find Dad?
Where has Dad gone?
He got angry with me and left.
Why? Got angry and left?
But why are you crying?
Shall I tell you something?
He has no hands.
Who will feed him?
- That's why I'm crying.
- You're crying.
Let's go home.
Grandma! Grandma!
Grandma! Get up!
Get up grandma!
Or I'll get water!
Okay I'll get water!
I'll throw water at you.
- Let her be.
- I'll call mother.
Mother, grandma is sleeping tight.
Mother, you're feeding others
with sweets and starving us!
Feed the dead and
starve the living to death!
This is life.
Open the door!
Open the door!
Mother open the door!
Dear Radha!
Shame on you! You took
Now have you come for the corpses?
You have your eyes set
on the 5 acres that remain!
You'll die a dog's death!
Doesn't matter. Even the
dog is a creation of God.
- What do you want?
- Money.
- She has no money to die!
- I'm ready to look after them all.
Try to understand me.
Explain to her that her
husband ditched her and left.
I'm still alive
I'll look after everything.
Take back the land, the oxen.
And we'll see about the loan too.
Mother, my ox has returned!
Will you leave me and go?
Now if you go, I won't
talk to you ever!
I'll never speak to you!
You won't go.
I won't talk if you go.
Come here.
- I won't.
- Son, take the ox out.
Fine. Just as you have returned
the oxen, return the loan too.
If you don't like my deal,
forget it.
Radha is not for sale.
She'll die but not sell herself.
She can be sold only for her kids.
Take your share when
the crop is harvested.
Now go away.
God! Now what will happen?
The crop is almost ready. If it
rains now, there'll be a famine.
God! We don't want water!
Hold me!
Help!
Mother! A snake!
Throw it Birju!
Go away from my mother!
Mother I'm very hungry.
- Give me some food.
- In a minute.
I'll light a blazing fire.
Mother, baby is not getting up.
Radha my queen.
You had called me over.
So I've come for my share.
If I wouldn't come now,
you'd say I didn't come.
Lord! Killed him finally?
Swear by God, I feel very sorry.
Son will you have some grams?
I won't have that.
I'll eat what mother is cooking.
Mother, I'm starving.
Very hungry.
There's nothing in this.
The food is cooked son.
Lord! Why are you doing this?
What to do? I'm so soft
I can't bear to see this!
Eat this son.
Throw it away. Throw it!
What kind of mother are you?
Eat it son.
In that hand too.
Throw it. Throw it!
Do you want me or the grams?
Mother and son, just the same!
By morning you'll come
to your senses.
I'm a very patient man.
When your anger cools down,
think over my proposal again.
Son! Birju!
Look at me!
Nothing will happen to my son.
Mother!
Yes, I'll give you the grams.
Hungry... grams...
I'll get them for you.
Mother, hungry... grams...
Bless you lady.
Radha the queen at my step?
I am blessed. Come in.
Come in.
My children are starving.
Give me food.
Give me food. My kids are hungry.
Understood.
I'll cover my queen in gold.
Don't worry my queen. Who holds the
generous man's hand will be happy.
Even if I keep a dog,
it will wear a gold chain.
Swear by God, you look
like the goddess of wealth.
- Come.
- I'll look like a goddess?
Didn't you feel ashamed
to come in this form?
If you've come in my form,
keep your image intact.
Don't laugh.
The goddess who carries
the burden of the world.
You won't be able to carry
the burden of motherhood.
Try and become a mother.
You'll give up in 2 steps
- She won't go from here.
- Don't you dare!
- Let go of her.
- Don't touch it!
She has given you wealth and
brought me here in poverty.
I want to show her
it's easy to preach
But very difficult to follow.
It's easy to watch the fun.
But very difficult to
lead life as in a play.
Very difficult.
See what a helpless mother
can do for her children!
To what depths she can sink!
She cannot give strength.
Then take away my shame!
I can't sacrifice my children!
He will return. He is alive.
This won't remain.
A woman's duty is motherhood.
Thank God you came to me.
Otherwise your sweet kids
would die.
- Come.
- Let go!
The goddess has returned my husband
She will also return my children.
- She will.
- Yes she will.
She'll return your husband and kids.
But at my hands!
Help me!
Won't you leave?
The entire village is going.
- I won't go.
- You want to starve here?
Nothing can be done in
this field for 2 years.
You've changed the
face of the village
Honestly I've neither seen
nor heard of such a crop!
Feels as if the crop has
fallen from heaven not earth.
Don't worry. Your share of
Go and take it.
- Yes master?
- Fill the carts.
How are you my son?
Get up son. This is my share.
First show me the account.
Then look at my crop.
So you want to see the account?
Have I fallen on such times
that I have to show you accounts?
Hear! He wants to see my books.
Your father never looked at
my books, what will you do?
The son will see
the father's account
Show him the account.
Move away.
What are you doing?
Aren't you ashamed?
I've grown old filling your house!
And for this grain, you're
aiming a gun at my son!
for my son!
Take it away! We don't want it!
Did I ask you to shoot?
Join an army if you want to shoot!
Why do you need guns?
I asked to show the account.
Take the grain. You don't do
the job you've come for! Shooting!
What are you waiting for?
I won't let him take one grain!
We'll have to give it if it's due.
- Take your share!
- Live long son.
Don't just stare. Lift it!
- Drop this!
- Mother!
I won't let him take the crop.
We've plowed the land like oxen.
It contains our sweat.
We stayed hungry for it
If this grain won't feed us,
I'll burn it up!
Then ask him to show me the account.
You want to see the books.
Here have a look.
Here study it.
Read it my son.
You read it mother.
Ask somebody else to read it.
- You read it!
- Read it. Don't feel shy.
He can't understand accounts.
You read and explain it to him.
- You read it uncle.
- This is knowledge.
If we could read,
we wouldn't see this day.
Then you signed it without reading?
Your grandma signed it!
