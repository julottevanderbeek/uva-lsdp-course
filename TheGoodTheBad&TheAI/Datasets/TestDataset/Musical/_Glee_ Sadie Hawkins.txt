Glee:
The New Directions!
are finished.
Glee.
I'm telling you,
it's been keeping me up at night.
They're doing all those weird
flips and superhuman jumps
at Sectionals.
Exactly, that's why they won.
And where was Roundfaced Warbler?
You said he was there
when you went back to Dalton,
but come Sectionals, poof, he's gone.
So, what are you saying?
I think they cheated at Sectionals.
Sam, you can't make
accusations like that
without any kind of evidence.
Well, then, I'll find some evidence.
Do you have any lip balm I can use?
What?
Conspiracy theories make my lips
get all chapped.
Come on dude, it's not weird.
We're like brothers.
Yeah, um, sure.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Mmm.
Guys?
You're late.
I know.
It's not...
This meeting of the
McKinley High Student Council
is now in session.
First order of business:
Secretary Cohen-Chang,
will you please read the minutes
from last meeting?
Sam did a Daniel Craig
impression for 45 minutes.
: I'll have
it shaken and stirred, too.
BLAINE:
That was fantastic.
Thank you,
Secretary Cohen-Chang.
Treasurer Motta, uh,
if we could go through
the budget appropriations
we were talking about last...
Yes, Tina?
It is now officially
where all the hot girls
get immediately snatched up
by all the hot guys,
then the sort of hot girls
get asked out by the sort of hot guys,
and then all the rest of us
have to sit around and wait
for all the nerds and the freaks
and the burn-outs and the losers
to work up some courage and ask us out
to the most awkward night
of heavy petting we're likely
to get till we wake up
in a nursing home
getting groped by an orderly.
Okay, well, the record,
I think you're totally sort of hot.
Like, if I was, like,
in a bunker with you,
I would totally hit that.
Tina, what are you suggesting?
I propose the First Annual
McKinley High Sadie Hawkins Dance.
It's what you call a dance
where the girls ask the guys.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
Why not?
It was the topic of discussion
at the last meeting of the.
"Too Young to Be Bitter Club."
Ever since I dated Puckerman,
no one will ask me to a dance.
I think everyone assumes
you have herpes.
No one asks me to dances
'cause I have such clammy hands.
I'm a hot piece of ass
and I want to shake
this sweet thing on a dance floor.
Ba-bam.
Becky is right, if I understood
what she said correctly.
Why are the guys so empowered
to ask us to a dance
when we just have to sit around
and wait?
Wouldn't it be great
if we got to choose?
All in favor of a dance
where the girls ask the guys...
BLAINE:
W-Wait...
wait, wait a second.
Hold on just one...
It's official.
Get ready for the first annual
McKinley High Sadie Hawkins Dance.
KURT:
Side Show,
RACHEL: All right, Brody has an
audition for
so I'm gonna go help him.
I'll see you at home later.
And I love you. Mwah.
KURT:
What's Adam's Apples?
NYADA's show choir;
You should join.
It's super fun.
I feel totally powerless.
JAKE: Okay, any second any girl
could just come up and ask us
to the dance, and it will
be very hard to say no.
Or worse, no one asks us at all.
This must be what the girls
feel like all the time.
It is.
Whoo!
Hey, Finn, want to arm wrestle?
It'll really get your blood flowing.
Not today, Coach.
Anyone?
Hey, pumpkin, I heard about Sue
taking over your choir room.
I'm really sorry about that.
Yeah, yeah, it's been pretty rough.
I feel like we're the Fugees
or something,
just bouncing around
from available classroom
to available classroom.
You... wait, you mean
like refugees?
Yeah. I mean, it's great we're
still together as a group,
but without competitions,
I have to come up
with something fun and
interesting on a weekly basis
just to keep everybody involved,
and this week I'm just stuck.
It's a no-brainer.
The Sadie Hawkins Dance.
Well, no offense, but how
am I supposed to make a lesson
out of a dumb school dance?
When I was in high school,
girls like me didn't get asked out.
So the only dance I could go to
was Sadie Hawkins.
I asked the preacher's son.
He was stoned the whole time,
but we had a ball.
Going to that dance gave me the courage
and the confidence
to join the football team.
I was the first girl
in Missouri to ever do it.
Sadie Hawkins
is a metaphor for empowerment,
and not just for women,
but for everyone
who is sick and tired
of the status quo.
I want to sit under Venus.
I want to sit under Uranus.
What's so funny?
So this week in Glee Club,
it's ladies' choice,
inspired by the Sadie Hawkins Dance.
Which I thought of.
It was my idea.
Yes, thank you, Tina.
And every girl will sing to whoever
they want to take to the dance.
KITTY: Well, I, for one,
love this lesson.
I've got a song I want
to sing to somebody.
KURT:
I can sing high and sing low
I can sing high and sing low
RACHEL :
Kurt, he's still sleeping.
Would you like some tea?
Yes, I would, but shh.
Yes.
Brody's here?
Did he spend the night?
Yeah. We had dinner
last night at Balthazar,
and he insisted on taking me home.
Rachel. You know, the train ride
back to Manhattan's really long,
so I just invited him to stay over.
Oh, Rachel Berry, I am scandalized.
Well, I just...
I seized the moment.
I really, I like him,
and I'm tired of second-guessing
something that feels so right.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Well, as long as you're happy
and I have a white noise machine,
I guess I'm happy, too.
How are you?
How was your first week?
It was good, you know, a little lonely,
but I was thinking to meet people,
I would join the show choir
called the Adam's Apples.
Oh, no, no, no, no. No.
Listen to me, there is a very rigid
performing arts hierarchy at NYADA,
and show choir is, like,
it's the lowest of the low.
It's beneath stage
managers and carpenters.
That is social and career suicide.
But at McKinley...
We're not at McKinley anymore.
And we're done being underdogs;
If you want to join a club,
just do anything but the Adam's Apples.
That's what all the
future chorus kids do.
If you do show choir in college,
all right,
you might as well be doomed
to a life of playing
a dancing teapot at Disneyland.
All right, so
Tina is ready to present her solo
and make her choice.
Gentlemen, prepare yourselves
for Tina Cohen-Chang.
Whoo! Whoo!
Thank you, Finn.
For my song, I'll be performing.
"I Don't Know How to Love Him"
from
It's about the pain
of unrequited love and...
Yeah, okay, just wrap it up.
Beiste needs the locker room
at 4:30.
Sorry. Hit it.
Who do you think she's asking?
The only obvious choice in the room.
A charming debonair
figure from her past.
A forbidden love she let
slip through her fingers.
Unique?
Really?
I don't know how to love him
What to do
How to move him
I've been changed
Yes, really changed
In these past few days
When I've seen myself
I seem like someone else
Don't you think it's rather funny
I should be in this position
I'm the one who's always been
So calm, so cool
No lover's fool
Running every show
He scares me so
I never thought I'd come to this
What's it all about?
What's it
all about?
Yet, if he said he loved me
I'd be lost
I'd be frightened
I couldn't cope
Just couldn't cope
I'd turn my head
I'd back away
I wouldn't want to know
He scares me so
Ooh, I want him so
I love him so.
Okay, let's hear it for Tina.
Yeah.
SUGAR:
Tina!
Whoo! Tina!
Tina!
So... Blaine,
will you go to the dance with me?
Oh, uh...
Wow, um,
Tina...
I don't know what to say.
Um...
no.
Thank you,
but no, no, thank you.
You're thinking about
signing up, aren't you?
Oh, uh, maybe.
I... You are...?
Adam, a senior and founder
and fearless leader
of the Adam's Apples, the group you are
very seriously considering joining.
I'm Kurt.
Kurt Hummel.
Your Winter Showcase performance
was breathtaking.
But now you're here,
and you're wondering where you fit in
and how can college be
so much like high school,
and you want to join my group,
but you're aware it's a step backwards,
and no, I'm not a mind-reader,
I'm just astute, like you.
We need you; we want you.
Well, I'm very impressed
you said all that in one breath,
but I don't think I'll be joining.
Man, a hard sell.
I respect that,
but I'm not willing to go down
without a fight;
Come hear us sing.
No strings attached.
No secret time-share condo
Ponzi scheme.
Just our voices
and your ears.
I present to you
the Adam's Apples.
L.A. face
with the Oakland booty
I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
When a girl walks in
with an itty-bitty waist
And a round thing
in your face, you get sprung
You want to pull up tough
You noticed that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
I'm tired of magazines
Saying flat butts are the thing
Take your average black man
and ask him that
She got to pack much back
So fellas
Fellas
Has your girlfriend
got the butt?
Tell her to shake it
Shake it
Shake that healthy butt
Baby got back
Baby got back
Baby got back
A word to the freak soul sisters
I wanna get wit' cha
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight
when I say I wanna
Till the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it
And quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
So ladies
Ladies
If you want to roll in my Mercedes
Then turn around
And stick it out
Even white boys gotta shout
Baby got back
Baby got back
Baby got back
Baby got back
Booty, booty, booty
Baby got back.
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.
Uh, my name is Brittany.
I know. Okay. I
just wasn't sure.
We've never actually had
a conversation before,
and this is exciting.
I noticed
that whenever you look at Jake,
you get a really sad look
on your face, and if it's quiet
enough, I can actually hear
that you're whimpering
like a suckling puppy.
I think you want to ask him to
the dance and you're afraid to.
We went out on a couple dates,
and it was really, really nice.
This is my locker.
Oh.
But then, after I
fainted at Sectionals,
he started acting really strange.
He stopped calling me
and he's acting all mysterious.
So can I make a suggestion then?
You need to find your power
and I'm gonna help you do that.
How?
Where are you going?
We're gonna sing a song together,
and the music usually starts
when I say something like,
"It's Brittany, bitch,"
or I do one of my magical turns.
I know something about love
You've gotta want it bad
If that guy's got into your blood
Go out and get him
If you want him to be
The very part of you
Makes you want to breathe
Here's the thing to do
Tell him that you're never
gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always
gonna love him
Tell him, tell him
Tell him, tell him right now
I know something about love
You've got to show it and
Make him see the moon up above
Reach out and get him
If you want him to be
Always by your side
If you want him to
Only think of you
Tell him that
you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always
gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him,
tell him right now
Ever since the world began
It's been that way for man
And women were created
To make love their destiny
Then why should true love be
So complicated
Oh, yeah, oh
Tell him that
you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always
gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him,
tell him right now
Girl, you've got to tell him
Tell him that
you're never gonna leave him
Tell him that you're always
gonna love him
Tell him, tell him, tell him
Tell him right now
Just take his hand in yours
and tell
Tell him, tell him
Tell him, tell him
right now.
Jake!
I mean, I mean...
...Jake, would you like to go
to the Sadie Hawkins Dance with me?
Yes.
Yes, I would.
FINN:
Okay, uh, anyone else?
BRITTANY:
Sam,
Mm-hmm? Will you go to
Sadie Hawkins with me?
:
Honor it would be.
Thank you.
Okay, I'm gonna get right to it.
Dump the bulimic loser and go to
the Sadie Hawkins Dance with me.
What are you talking about?
I thought you and Marley
were friends now.
Duh, we are. I'm still gonna
gaslight her every chance I get.
Look, I realize Marley's super sweet,
and I'm sure you have
great conversations
when you share milkshakes
down at the drive-in
about how you both
love President Eisenhower.
But good luck getting past
first base with that girl.
I, on the other hand,
could offer you a little...
bit... more.
Oh, really? I thought you were
the good Christian  type.
I was.
But I've had a change of heart.
Decided to play by my own rules.
You have needs.
: Are you really sure
Marley's  for the job?
I owe you an apology.
I... also think you sort of
owe me an apology because...
that was maybe
the most humiliating moment
I've experienced in Glee Club,
and that's saying something.
But still...
I'm sorry.
I forgot that story you told
about your old school.
How the whole reason you
transferred to Dalton
was because you got bullied
at a Sadie Hawkins Dance.
No wonder you don't want to go.
I apologize.
Thank you, Tina,
but that's not why I can't
go to the dance with you.
Then what is the reason?
I-I can't tell you that.
It-s-it's really
embarrassing.
I swear to God I-I
won't tell anyone.
I have a crush on somebody,
and I don't want to go
to a dance where everyone's
gonna be romantic there but me.
Who?
Who is it?
It's-it's a guy
and he's straight and he doesn't know
that I like him.
I swear to God I won't tell anyone.
I'm not some predatory gay,
so... nothing's
gonna happen.
Who is it?
Tell me, Blaine. Y-You can
trust me.
It's Sam.
SAM:
Dude.
Look at this.
This is Hunter Clarington
two years ago.
Look how skinny his head is.
Okay, this is him now.
Look how much thicker his head is!
So maybe he started working out.
What, doing
skull-widening exercises?
Dude, human growth hormone! HGH!
Same thing happened to Mark McGwire
:
And Kirstie Alley
and Drew Carey and Star Jones
and Aretha Franklin,
Cedric the Entertainer...
It's so stupid.
No.
It's not stupid.
I know what it's like
to have a crush on someone
who's never gonna love you back.
I know it's all just a fantasy.
I-I mean...
I'm proud of our relationship.
I'm proud the gay guy can be
friends with the straight guy.
I'm proud of showing
the school that. I just...
I don't want to jeopardize our
friendship, you know? Blaine...
you miss Kurt.
You need someplace to
put your love, right?
I guess.
And then there are those lips...
Those lips. Yes, those lips.
And when he does all those impressions?
It's pure crushable crack.
:
Hello, soul sister.
Isn't that Mr. Mister on the radio?
Stereo? The way you look
ain't fair, you know.
Okay... here's what we're gonna
do about your very human
and moving dilemma.
We are going to the Sadie
Hawkins Dance together.
We'll go as best friends,
and we're gonna have
the most fun night ever.
Okay?
Come on.
Okay.
I mean, I don't know what to do.
Marley is such a great girl
and I really do want to be a
good guy, but it's, like...
Okay. Let me stop you
right there.
Young guys like you
think you have to hit
a home run every time.
But as long as you're getting on base,
you're always in position to score.
No, you don't understand.
I'm not even getting on base.
And all of a sudden.
Kitty's inviting me
to the Home Run Derby.
Look at me.
I'm your hitting coach,
and I'm waving you off.
Seriously?
I mean, it's, like, a sure thing.
Yeah, it's sure to be
some of the best and...
weirdest toe-curling
you'll ever have, but...
it's also sure to ruin your life.
I had every flavor
of Cheerio you can imagine.
Original, Honey Nut.
Did it really mean anything?
No.
I mean, you really like
this Marley chick, right?
You got to resist that
Jesus-loving little devil.
Okay, but Kitty is all up on me.
She's not going away.
Don't you worry, little brother
from a different-colored mother.
I'll make her go away.
RACHEL: Okay, so Brody said he's
gonna meet me at the library
to go downtown.
Do you want to come?
No, no, thanks; I don't want
to be a haggy third wheel
on your guys's date.
Come on, you won't be.
All right, you know
what I can't wait for?
I can't wait for you to find the
new man of your dreams. Mm.
And then me, you, him,
and Brody can all go
on double-dates together,
and it'll be so much fun.
I really feel
like it's gonna happen soon.
Actually, there is someone
that I have my eye on.
Oh, my God. Who?
Is it Raul Esparza?
No, I wish. 'Cause
that would be great.
No, he goes to school with us,
but, I don't know, lately things
have been happening, and...
I'm just gonna try
and figure out if he likes me.
ADAM:
Hi, uh... it's for the Tennessee
Williams Play-Reading Club.
You'd make a fantastic Brick.
Kind of look like a young Paul Newman.
Hey, Kurt. Nice plié. Oh...
Hi, again. Uh, no.
Uh, my ex-boyfriend was
more of the dancer in...
in our relationship.
Let's try this again.
Hey, Kurt.
Nice plié.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Oh, my God, he is
totally crushing on you!
What is his name?
I-I don't want
to jinx it, okay?
I mean, he's 22,
sophisticated, handsome.
Great.
Just not what he wants...
to be with me.
Oh, God, Kurt, you are a catch, okay?
And now that, you know, things
with you and Blaine are good,
and you're finally over the breakup,
I think it's really time for you
to put yourself out there, you know?
Hey, look, if this guy doesn't want
to ask you out, then you
ask him out, okay?
I promise you, it'll be worth the risk.
There's nothing like being
in love in New York.
Love? Already?
What can I say?
Things move fast here.
It's not like high school.
Says the girl who almost
got married before graduation.
Seize the moment! Do it!
It'll be worth it.
I'm going to keep this simple,
for my sake as much as yours.
Stay away from my little bro.
He's not interested in
your skanky Meow Mix.
Speaking of things that are
past their freshness date,
didn't you graduate...
barely?
I recently relocated back to Lima.
I find it to be a less
distracting environment
to focus on my
Don't you have to be able
to spell to be a writer?
I know how to spell.
Leave my brother A-L-O-N.
I understand the Puckerman
musk is impossible
for chicks to resist.
We're like
chocolate chip cookies
right out of the oven.
Sure you know we're not
good for you, but one whiff
of our fresh-baked goodness,
and the next thing you know,
you're lying in bed,
covered in crumbs, crying.
Jake is fighting his instincts.
He's trying to be a good guy.
If you really like him,
you'll back off and give him
a chance to do the right thing.
I don't like Jake.
I'm a mean, hot, bitch that
likes to get what she wants.
Well, it's not gonna happen.
I'm not going to let it happen,
so all you're going to do is get
rejected and embarrass yourself.
Fair point.
But I certainly can't
go to the dance alone.
Out.
What are you doing Saturday night?
You want to go with me?
It's depressing that
you hang around school,
but you're just hot
enough to pull it off.
I assume vintage Puckerman
is just as tasty.
It's better, but you can't handle me.
You're used to dealing with amateurs.
I'm professional.
What's the difference?
Amateurs have threesomes.
Professionals have foursomes.
I've seen things, done things
that would keep you up at night.
You want to keep me away
from your brother?
Give me a big old yarn ball
of muscles to distract me.
Aren't you underage?
I have a fake I.D.
Good enough for me.
It's Sadie Hawkins, so, I assume
that means you're paying
for everything.
And if you want to get all up
in this, I expect to be fed.
I'll pick you up at 7:00. We can
swing by the drive-through.
And my dates are always
underwear-optional.
Tina, these decorations are incredible.
Well, Sadie Hawkins Dances are
sometimes called "Snowballs,"
so that's where I got the
idea for a snowflake theme.
I'm really glad
that you invited me to this.
No Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder
from what happened before?
I thought there might be, but no.
I'm thrilled.
ARTIE:
What's up, McKinley?
We've got quite the set.
We'd like to dedicate
this song to all the strong, proud
and empowered ladies
who stuck their necks out
to make this happen.
This week, you showed us
what it feels like
to wait anxiously
by the phone that never rings.
The horror when all your friends
get asked to the dance,
and you don't,
and you have to sit there...
BLAINE: All right, cool.
Thank you, Artie.
This next one's for all the,
uh, powerful women out there.
Ooh-ooh... ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah
Uh
A scrub is a guy
that thinks he's fly
And is also known as a buster
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass, so
I don't want your number
No, I don't want
to give you mine and
No, I don't
want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want
none of your time and
No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't
get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy
That can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
If you don't have a car
and you're walking
Oh, yes, son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home
With your mama, oh, yes, son
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you, baby
If you have a shorty,
but you don't show love
Oh, yes, son, I'm talking to you
Wanna get with me with no money
Oh, no, I don't want
No, oh
No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't
get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy
that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't
get no love from me.
You're awesome.
:
awesome.
I really like you, Jake.
But I have this problem.
I always assume the best in people.
That's my favorite thing
about you, besides your eyes.
I lost my balance and
I got in her way...
Thanks. It's just...
when you assume the best like that,
you tend to miss stuff,
like... signs.
Like when someone's about to hurt you.
You're safe with me, okay?
How can I convince you?
I need you to be with me and only me.
And I need to take things slow.
If you can agree to that, I think
we could have the best time,
but if not, then,
I'm sorry, I... I just can't.
Oh, hey! I'll be right back.
Okay.
You know you're sweeter
than a tangerine...
BEISTE:
What's the problem
here, single ladies?
Unless you're beat up like me
from riding a buffalo
down at the state fair,
you should be out on the dance floor.
This ain't a dance for flowers
to sprout on the wall.
Get out there and spread your petals.
We're not flowers.
We're losers.
And this dance only
doubled how pathetic
I already feel.
DOTTIE :
Look, there's Brett!
Hi, Brett.
Girls, take it
from a former wallflower myself.
Life's not about waiting to be asked,
and neither is this dance.
Now, get out there
and get what's yours.
Just remember one thing:
The worst he could say is no.
You lift me up
Don't you ever stop
I'm here with you...
I will if you will.
Now it's all or nothing...
Oh, hey, Kurt, I was just
thinking about you.
Thoughts on a Sondheim
super mash-up?
Like epic to the power of epic.
We'll all probably die
while singing it.
You in?
I'm in.
Hey, Adam...
I was wondering...
Do you want to dance?
What you gonna do
when the love burns down?
Artie, will you dance with me?
Would you ever want
to get a drink or...
or a coffee sometime?
Yes...
Yes...
Yeah, that'd be great.
Great. Here, let
me give you my...
number.
Stay until your love is
Alive and kicking
Stay until your love is...
This is so nice.
It is, isn't it?
I told you this would be fun.
You were so right.
You know, I love your
new attitude these days.
It's so empowered.
I love your... everything.
You're perfect.
Oh, Tina Cohen-Chang,
where have you been all my life?
Right here.
Dude... I need you.
Huge breakthrough in the case.
Let's go. TINA: Wait!
Blaine and I were just about to...
About to what?
To keep dancing.
I'm sorry, Tina; this is
bigger than all of us.
I gotta go.
Did you not hear me?!
Where are you...?
SAM: Let's go!
You can dance with us.
BRITTANY:
Yeah, McKinley!
Okay, a friendly reminder:
Uh, don't eat the snowflakes.
They're fake.
And the glitter sticks
to the roof of your mouth.
TINA: All right,
ladies, grab your date
and get on the dance floor!
Because the guys
were just a warm-up
for the real main attraction:
Us!
Oh, yeah, yeah,
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh
Oh, yeah, yeah...
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh
Never had much faith
in love or miracles
Never wanna
put my heart on the line
Swimming in your world
Is something spiritual
I'm gonna get every time
you spend the night
'Cause your sex takes me
to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it sho-o-o-ows
Yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too lo-o-o-ong
For too lo-o-o-ong
Yeah, you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too lo-o-o-ong
For too
lo-o-o-o-ong
Oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Can I just stay here?
Spend the rest
of my days here?
Whoa, whoa
'Cause you make me feel like
You make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
Ooh, oh-oh-oh
For too lo-o-o-ong...
For too lo-o-o-o-ong
Yeah, you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too lo-o-o-ong
For too long
For too lo-o-o-o-ng
Oh-oh, oh-ong
Oh, yeah, eh, eh
Yeah, eh, eh, eh
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, eh, eh, eh
Ah.
...for days like this
I'm like a, like an orange soda
'Cause my skin is sun-kissed
Everybody bust
to the right, now...
Look, I usually avoid
dating Jewish guys
on account of your people
killing my Jesus.
I was willing to make an exception
because of your biceps,
but I'm gonna have to end
this little experiment
in religious tolerance
if you don't stop dancing
like an idiot.
One night with me, and
I'll have you studying
for your Bat Mitzvah.
Not a chance.
I like bacon too much.
I read your screenplay, you know.
Why didn't you tell me?
I gave it to you, like, three days ago.
It took me that long to get through
all the spelling errors.
Have you heard of spell check?
No.
Anyways, it's actually really good.
You really think so?
The pool boy at the White House
is the only one who
can save the President
from alien terrorist aquatic pythons?
I am sold.
I like Keanu for the lead.
You have promise.
I really think you
could be a screenwriter.
If you're done dancing
like you lost your leg
in a motorcycle accident,
why don't we back to my car
and have at each other
in the back seat?
Right on.
But I have to warn you,
I get pretty hungry after sex, so...
we should make it quick,
'cause Sonic Burger
closes in an hour.
Makes the boys say "Hello"
On this P-A-R-T-Y
All night long,
we gon' party till dawn
Look at the pictures, Finn.
It's not just Hunter.
Half the Warblers have gained
ten pounds of muscle
since they joined the team.
FINN:
I already looked into this.
This is a weight training regimen
that they stole from Vocal Adrenaline.
You can't just go from being a twig
to Jean-Claude Van Damme
in a few months.
Tell him, Sam.
Look, the average male gains
up to two pounds of
muscle per month... fact!
And that's without cheating.
We looked it up online.
Plus, uh...
Look at this cell phone video
that Artie and Joe Hart took
down at the Lima Bean the other day.
What the hell is this?
Did you put Splenda in my latte?
You're a barista!
You don't think!
You need to remember like six things
Here comes the biscotti throw.
And one of them is that the
sugar comes in the brown packet
and the Splenda is in the yellow!
I freaking hate Splenda!
It tastes like pencils!
Why are you putting pencils
in my latte?!
Now,  is 'roid rage
and you know it.
Look, chapter seven, subsection 16,
rule four, line nine.
"Any team using
performance-enhancing drugs,"
including amphetamines,
anabolic steroid,
human growth hormone or Four Loko
will be automatically
disqualified from competition.
The rule is retroactive,
so if we can prove that they used
at Sectionals, they'll have to forfeit
and we'll win.
Glee Club is back.
Blam!
Guys, what you are asking me
to do here is beyond serious.
The Warblers are, like,
one of the most respected
glee clubs in the country.
To accuse them of this
when-when all we have for proof
is photos of some dudes' heads
and a-a cell phone video?
Look, I want Glee Club back
just as much as you guys, but...
this isn't enough.
We need more real proof.
We have some.
Me.
I knew when Trent didn't
perform with the Warblers
at Sectionals that something was up.
FINN:
Yeah, he is
kind of like the sunshine
of the group, isn't he?
Blaine and I joined
the Warblers together.
It was a band of brothers,
a group joined by harmony and honor.
And then Blaine left and
Sebastian came, then Hunter...
They just chipped away at everything
that was good and special about us.
Next.
TRENT:
Next. Singing with the
Warblers is my life,
You. Sensitive.
Get over here.
What are you, afraid?
I'm not doing this.
I don't even shave yet.
The Warblers mean everything to me,
and it's killing me
to betray them like this.
You're not betraying them.
Hunter betrayed the Warblers,
you're saving them.
Yeah, that's what they said
about Brutus.
And Cassius.
Look, if I go public with this,
then the Warblers' reputation...
it's ruined forever.
Years of honorable melodies
and harmonies, all forgotten.
Look, the Warblers'
reputation was ruined
the second
they decided to cheat to win.
Fact.
So, what do you say?
Will you do this?
Will you testify against the Warblers?
Hey, sorry I'm late.
What are you doing?
It's 9:45.
I invited you over at 9:00.
You're 45 minutes late.
Your turkey burger is cold.
You know, six months ago,
I probably would've just smiled
and reheated this all up for you,
and I would have been grateful
that you showed up at all.
Wait, you're actually pissed?
Yeah, I am.
You know, it's amazing
how I strive for such greatness
for myself and my career,
but I'm fine with taking
whatever scraps I can get
in my personal life.
Well, I'm sorry.
The train was late.
You should've left earlier.
Okay?
Let me ask you,
I-if I would've told you
that there was, like,
ten million dollars here
at this apartment waiting for you,
then would you have come on time?
Because I think I'm worth
more than ten million dollars.
Yes.
You're priceless.
And you're right.
And if it means anything to you,
it was freezing on the train platform.
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?
No.
Because I didn't care.
Because that train
was taking me here, to you.
And all I was thinking was that
I would wait all night,
I-I would wait my whole life
for that train,
if it meant that I got to spend
my last day with you.
I guess I could
put it in the microwave.
Not yet.
We-We have
plenty of time to eat.
I want to dance.
Come on.
But there's no music.
Well, use your imagination.
My love must be
A kind of blind love
I can't see
Anyone but you
I am awesome.
I mean, I always knew I was pretty cool
but tonight is the first night
I realized how awesome I was.
Why is that?
Because you are the most amazing
person I've ever met.
And somehow,
I convinced you to be into me.
You're incredible.
I'm done. I don't...
I don't want to be with anybody else.
All I need is you.
I don't know
if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes
For you
BLAINE:
Tina!
Excuse me.
Hey. I thought you split.
No. No, not at all.
We were just dealing
with some Glee stuff.
Anything good?
I'm not sure yet,
but if it works out, we may
have just saved the Glee Club.
Is there anything you can't do?
I know I can't possibly
leave here without having
at least one slow dance with you.
Or on the crowded
Avenue
But they all disappear
From view
And I only have eyes
For you
I only have eyes for you.
I promise I will never be late again.
I'll get an apartment out here.
Why don't you just move in?
All right, let the record
state that the ladies of McKinley
are grateful
to Tina Cohen-Chang.
That Sadie Hawkins Dance
gave me back my swag.
I not only snagged the cutest
Christian hippie in all of Ohio,
I was also empowered
to apply for a wrestling
scholarship at...
Harvard.
I think Brett really likes me.
He even baked me brownies.
Isn't that sweet?
I can't stop eating them.
And I got to third base, bitches!
The dance couldn't have
gone more perfectly
if I do say so myself.
And just between us girls,
I think I found the love of my life.
What? You're not talking
about Gay Blaine?
The "Too Young to Be Bitter
Club" is hereby disbanded.
Bring it in, Tina! Bring it in!
Get over here, Tina.
