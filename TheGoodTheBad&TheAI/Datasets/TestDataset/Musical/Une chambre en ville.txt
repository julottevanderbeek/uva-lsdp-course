A ROOM IN TOWN
Adaptation: Carlos Clarens
Subtitling: TITRA FILM Paris
Break it up! Go home!
We don't want trouble.
Let us through! We won't go!
We want to come through!
Let us come through!
We're here to fight for our rights.
Break it up! Go home!
Withdraw in orderly fashion.
We're here to fight for our rights!
For our wives and children,
and our children's children.
We want to come through!
Let us come through!
We're here to fight for our rights.
Dammit!
They're splitting our eardrums!
Cops, pigs, scums, bums!
Stand back! Disperse!
Cops, pigs, scums, bums!
Don't come near!
And quit protesting!
Stand back! Disperse!
Don't call us names.
Cops, pigs, scums, bums!
Guilbaud,
I should have known.
These peasants stop at nothing.
To think I was kind enough
to let him lodge here!
A Communist! What gall!
Is that you, Guilbaud?
Hello Madam.
When will you learn
not to slam the door?
I'm sorry, Madame Langlois.
Wait, I must speak to you.
I have no time.
Don't worry, I'll be brief.
You were demonstrating.
Don't deny it!
Does it bother you?
It embarrasses me.
People will talk.
Let them talk.
Try to understand.
During his lifetime,
my husband the Colonel
would never have stood for it.
I don't want to house
an anarchist.
My ideas are no concern of yours.
I pay for my room, you know!
If you don't like my ideas
I can move out.
Thaùs not what I mean!
- May I come in?
- The place is yours.
I'm crying my eyes out.
Iùs that damn teargas.
The bastards!
Would you have a cigarette?
I don't have any left.
I don't dare go out in the street.
I'm scared of crowds,
even at Carnival time.
They're not mild.
When the Colonel was alive
I only smoked army issue.
Don't mind me.
The commotion upset me.
Riots, tension, hate.
I can't cope with it.
Try to understand.
We come from different worlds.
That doesn't mean
we can't be friends.
Friends?
Hard to believe.
You won't be my friend?
I don't give a damn!
I'm so Ionely since my son died.
Tomorrow iùll be one year
since he killed himself.
Two years to the day
since my husband died.
Forgive me.
Could you lend me your shoe brush?
Yes, of course.
What happened to him?
My husband?
No, your son.
He killed himself like a fool
on his way to Paris.
He was driving 180km/h,
yet he was in no hurry.
He never worked a day in his life.
And the Colonel?
He died in Indochina.
I hadn't seen him for five years.
We had separated long before.
As for my daughter, the shrew,
I might as well be dead.
I haven't had a word
since she was married.
She, who used to say
she'd never find the right man.
Still, she married well.
As for me, I lost
my title along with my illusions
when I married the Colonel.
From Baroness de Neuville
I became Madame Langlois.
Well, we can't have everything.
Would you like some wine?
I have no time, thank you.
I've an appointment.
Are you going to march?
Iùs over for today.
I've a date with a girl.
I should remind you
that I want no visitors here.
Thaùs what hotel rooms are for.
Do as you like, but elsewhere.
Do I ask you
where you make love?
Or how often? Or who with?
You're bothering me.
Don't misunderstand.
Anyway, I should tell you
that with the strike,
I won't be able to pay you this month.
I won't leave until I find another place.
I'm not going to sleep
under a bridge.
Thanks for telling me.
Iùs nothing, really.
Good evening.
Guilbaud, before you go,
leave me a cigarette.
Take the pack.
- Guilbaud?
- No, iùs me.
- Edith?
- Yes, mother.
- How did you get in?
- I still have my key.
You must give it back to me.
Why? Did you lose yours?
- I need it.
- You must have a lover!
At least spare me
that kind of humor.
So you are back.
What have you done
since your marriage?
Not much.
I thought you'd forgotten me.
Why don't you take off your coat?
I'm not staying, Mother.
What are the streets like?
Iùs quiet. Cops everywhere.
Smells like pig.
I was stopped on the way.
I really wanted to see you.
I was just talking about you.
Who to?
My tenant.
I thought you saw no one.
Atenant. Thaùs funny.
Your father's pension
wasn't enough to pay
your brother's debts.
I had to rent your room last month.
You rented my old room?
Why not Philippe's?
Your brother's room? Never.
Iùs been locked since he died.
I haven't touched a thing.
I'll never have the courage
to open the door
and face all those memories.
Don't be so melodramatic!
You wouldn't understand.
Don't move around like that.
- I have ants in my legs.
- Are you wearing stockings?
Haven't for two years now.
- What does the tenant do?
- He's on strike.
I didn't mean that.
He works in the shipyard.
He's a fitter or a tool-maker.
Is he a metal-worker then?
Why do you ask?
Why this sudden interest
in the working class?
The other day, my fortune teller
predicted a great love affair
with a metal-worker.
Won't you stay for dinner?
Edmond is waiting.
You didn't bother to write.
You could have sent a postcard.
A postcard?
I never left the apartment.
Didn't you go on a honeymoon trip?
You mean Morocco?
We didn't go.
Did Edmond change his mind?
No, I did.
He's a disappointment.
In what way?
Want me to draw you a picture?
I hate that expression.
I've told you a hundred times.
Father used to say it.
Thaùs no excuse.
Better come out with it,
don't beat around the bush.
I can tell you. Iùs no secret.
His family knows.
Edmond is impotent.
Do you think iùs funny?
You don't know how to go about it.
Thaùs the best one yet.
I know what I'm talking about.
Iùs because you don't love him.
If you did, you'd know how to...
Thaùs enough!
Besides, you never loved anyone.
Iùs not that I don't love Edmond.
But he's stingy and jealous.
Right this moment,
I haven't got a penny on me.
You deserve it.
You married him for his money.
Atv salesman!
A real Prince Charming.
You don't know
what I've been through.
I must beg and implore.
At least Father was never there.
But EdmonÔs after me all day long.
He follows me around,
wakes me up at night,
wants to know
if I'm thinking about him.
He questions me, tracks me down.
Iùs hell.
Here's your key.
Can you lend me some money.
I'm broke.
What is this?
Iùs a cap.
I can see that.
Whose is it?
GuilbauÔs.
He must have forgotten it.
His name is Guilbaud?
Yes, FranÁois Guilbaud.
Did you wait long?
Just five minutes.
Did you see the cops?
The streets are full.
Protect me, FranÁois.
Hold me tight.
Violette, you're flushed.
Iùs because I ran.
Violets are like that.
They blush when they're happy.
They fade when they're not.
What did you do today?
I loafed and wandered around.
I don't know what to do all day.
You should rest up.
I can't sleep.
I'm up at six,
as if I had to punch the clock.
A customer at the shop
told me about the riot
in front of the police station.
The cops held us back.
We couldn't get through.
And they used their rotten tear gas.
We had to disperse,
next time we'll fight.
You'll win.
Are you sure?
Yes, because I love you.
I love you, FranÁois.
I want to live with you now.
I feel cold without you.
Leùs get married, FranÁois.
And the strike?
The city hall is not on strike.
But now I'm broke.
The strike won't last.
And I'm still working.
I can't even pay the Baroness.
Don't feel sorry for her.
We'll rent a studio.
You'll be able
to leave the old hag at last.
I want a room for us alone.
You understand, FranÁois.
Come, I'll take you to dinner.
I told Mother
I'd come home late.
I can't. Dambiel is waiting for me.
They're assigning strike pickets.
Go and picket, my love.
See you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
Meet me at the shop.
Don't forget.
I love you so, FranÁois!
Let dawn follow night,
and bring on a new day.
A day of light, at last,
a day of hope,
peace and happiness.
We'll resume negotiations.
The workers of Saint Nazaire
will be joining us.
- And how do we eat?
- A support group has been created.
If negotiations don't succeed,
we'll march to the police station.
And the cops?
Same tactic. No violence.
How are you?
I'm fine.
We picket until eleven.
Menager just drew the list.
We must hold on.
I know. I heard.
Don't look sad.
It seems to bother you.
Iùs not that.
I can take it.
I got no mouths to feed.
- What then?
- Nothing.
Iùs Violette.
She doesn't agree?
Yes, but she wants to get married.
This is hardly the right time.
No money, no job.
Soon, I won't have a place to stay.
Come home and bunk with the kid.
Anything wrong with Violette?
She's crazy about me,
while I just pretend.
I'm fond of her, you know.
I think she's nice.
But I don't want to live with her.
She dreams, she makes plans.
She's happy, but I can't dream.
I can't make plans.
Her love scares me.
I don't know how to tell her.
Be careful.
What do you mean?
You mustn't hurt her.
I know.
Still, I feel like leaving her.
You're early.
FranÁois couldn't stay with me.
- Had your dinner?
- Not yet.
Will you be long?
I'm almost done.
What is it? You look different.
I'm happy, thaùs all.
Mother, if I married FranÁois
and left home
to live with him,
would you hate me?
Of course not.
I'd be happy for you.
You know that.
If my leaving
would make you unhappy,
I wouldn't go.
You worry too much.
Think of yourself first,
of your own life.
I've lived mine.
One, two, three, four.
Iùs him again.
The metal-worker?
Thaùs him.
One, two, three, four.
How wonderful!
Don't say a word.
I don't like it.
Please, Madame Sforza!
Iùs the other one.
Edmond!
Iùs serious, isn't it?
You must be on your guard.
What must I do?
I just told you.
I see nothing more.
The cards are silent.
- Where were you?
- At Mother's.
Iùs almost nine.
And this afternoon?
I couldn't get
through the demonstration.
There was a riot,
but you don't care about strikes.
I care but I'm not a metal-worker.
After all, tv salesmen
never go on strike.
Why not?
I'd like to see you.
You're such a coward.
- What are you doing?
- Taking some money.
Say, you didn't sell much today!
Edith, give it back!
I forbid you to!
I need it for my book-keeping.
I couldn't buy a thing today.
You just said
you were at your mother's.
I couldn't even pay Madame Sforza.
Do you think she does it for fun?
You mustn't see
that old fortune teller again!
I don't work all week
so you can waste money
on fortune tellers.
Let me go, Edmond.
You're hurting me.
You burnt me
with your soldering iron.
Look at the blister!
Forgive me.
Bastard!
I didn't mean to.
Soldering fiend!
Keep your rotten money.
I know where to find some elsewhere.
Now let me go, you dirty bastard!
Please calm down, darling.
Rotten cop, SS!
I didn't mean to!
Please forgive me.
I swear! Listen to me!
You should be ashamed!
You're out walking around like this?
Iùs your fault,
I've nothing to wear.
Thaùs no reason!
So now you're a street-walker!
The strikers must have loved it!
Get out! Get dressed!
Come back when you're decent!
You won't have to tell me twice.
I warn you, I've had it.
You won't see me again
anytime soon!
Edith, come back,
I didn't mean it.
Take the money, iùs yours.
I didn't know what I was saying.
You disgust me.
Please come back.
You know I love you.
You'll do as you please.
I could never live without you.
Iùs too much to bear.
I'm so miserable!
I love you, Edith.
Edith, I'm just too dumb.
Shit, I left my cap at the cafe.
You didn't have it on then.
Thaùs right. Now I know.
I left it at home.
See you tomorrow.
Good evening.
Do I shock you?
Are you afraid I'll catch cold?
Is that all?
You saw what matters.
Make up your mind.
You come at the wrong time.
I'm on strike at the moment.
I'm not.
I'm broke.
I don't care about money.
Come along, my sweet, iùs late.
You should be in bed.
You're the most beautiful girl
I ever made love to.
I never made love with a guy
I liked as much as you.
You're not a real whore?
I only work half-time.
Give me my coat, I'm a little cold.
Whaùs this?
My husband beat me.
- And this?
- Iùs a burn.
The bastard!
Funny you should say that.
My very words.
He's stingy and jealous too.
I walk the streets
to get even with him.
We've been married one month,
can you believe it?
Not really.
Are you married?
No.
You mean you're free?
Exactly.
And with the strike,
I've got lots of time to myself.
What do you do?
I'm a fitter and a tool-maker.
Do you know what that is?
Sure! You're a metal-worker.
Are you surprised that I know?
Iùs nothing to laugh about.
My fortune teller predicted
a love affair with a metal-worker.
Do you believe the cards?
I should, now that I met you.
There are thousands of us in Nantes.
- How beautiful you are.
- How pretty you are.
I love the touch of your skin.
I love the look in your eyes.
Whaùs your name?
Iùs FranÁois.
I'd like to see you
but you can't come to my place.
I rent a room
in the house of a crazy Baroness.
She doesn't want me
to bring girls home.
By chance, is your name Guilbaud?
How did you know?
The crazy Baroness,
as you call her,
is my mother.
My name is Edith.
- Who's there?
- Iùs your son-in-law.
Are you mad?
Do you know what time it is?
Is she in her room?
Who do you mean?
- Your daughter.
- Why?
She's gone.
She stormed out.
She hasn't come home.
I'm worried.
I thought she'd be here.
Girls usually go home to mother
after an argument.
She's not the type.
My little Edith!
Where can she be?
- Iùs my fault.
- I'm sure of that.
Thaùs enough, please.
What exactly happened?
Less than nothing.
You know how she is.
We were just talking,
then she got mad.
From what I've heard,
she's not entirely to blame.
What are you insinuating?
Edith told me a few things.
She came crying home to mother!
She confided in me
because she's unhappy.
What did she say?
She admitted
that you were not always...
that you were not up to it
when it came down to it.
- What can I do about it?
- I don't know.
See a doctor.
There must be a cure.
Edith is sincere.
She'll return to you.
Sincere!
I caught her
with her hand in the cash-box.
Today she went walking
naked under her fur coat.
She dared to tell me
she had nothing to wear.
You asked for it, my dear.
Where can she be?
Whaùll become of me, without her?
You should have given her money.
Maybe she's killed herself.
You don't know her.
I'll call the police.
They have their hands full
with the strikers.
What have I done?
You're not going to moan all night.
Go home and take a shower.
I'm sure by now she's home
like a good little girl.
That tramp!
Take hold of yourself.
I've always hated vulgarity.
I won't have her insulted
to my face.
Not that she's perfect, but...
Do you think she has a lover?
I never said that.
You're dreaming!
Someone you know.
Someone she met before me.
Someone she ran into again.
And I was getting worried,
I was ready to forgive!
You know who he is.
Thaùs enough my friend.
You're completely mad.
You know everything.
You're protecting them!
I warn you, if I find them together
I'm capable of anything.
If you see her, tell her.
I love Edith and I'll kill her.
Stay away!
I'll kill her, do you hear?
My poor man, you'll end up in court.
Look, iùs already daylight.
I must go now.
Tell me more.
Mother died as well.
I came to work in Nantes.
I looked for a room in town.
I came to your mother's
by chance.
You're a real country boy.
My darling Guilbaud.
Even tired you're beautiful.
I feel so nice in your arms.
Let me tell you that I love you.
I'd like to stay but I can't.
Iùs daylight,
I must go.
When will I see you again?
Tonight if you wish.
Be here tonight at eight.
Give me the strength to wait.
I need you so.
You're up early.
Something wrong?
I'd like to see FranÁois.
He'll be here at ten.
Last night, we finished late.
What a pity.
I wanted to talk to him.
He must still be at the Baroness'.
I don't want to go there.
Why?
She scares me.
Don't be silly.
She's not going to eat you.
Is it urgent?
Not really.
It is, for me.
What should I tell him?
Nothing. Iùs not serious.
Is it a secret?
Not really,
your wife already knows.
I'm pregnant.
Shit.
Don't say that. I'm happy.
FranÁois will make up his mind
to marry me, I'm sure.
Before,
we had no real reason to marry.
Iùs different now, you know.
Don't you agree?
I wouldn't know.
I do. And thaùs why
I wanted to tell him myself.
You can wait if you wish.
I don't want to be late.
The floor manager is on my case.
I've felt faint a few times.
I know him.
He'll make trouble.
Don't tell FranÁois.
I'm counting on you.
I swear.
You'll be godfather.
Sure.
Listen to me!
Negotiations failed.
St. Nazaire will join us
when we march on Thursday.
Will it last long?
Six months more.
We must hold on tight.
Marching got us nowhere.
We mustn't give up.
Quiet! There's worse.
Management decided today
to lay off some workers.
Iùs a dirty trick.
Talks will resume tomorrow
and we won't accept the lay-offs.
The following are dismissed:
I've come to see Guilbaud.
He's not here.
Are you sure?
I'm telling you.
Thaùs too bad.
He could be in his room.
He's not, believe me.
He hasn't come home.
Not that it concerns me!
Do you know where he is?
I haven't the faintest idea.
Tell him I'll wait for him
until ten at the cafe.
Is that you, Guilbaud?
Don't look at me. I look awful.
I must say you look terrible.
You should see yourself.
I was awake all night.
So was I,
but not for the same reason.
My son-in-law woke me up at two.
His wife was gone.
He'll get her back.
He was naturally upset.
They had an argument,
but I couldn't get to
the bottom of it.
I wonder what she said
to drive him to such a state.
He's usually so sedate.
She's fed up.
What do you know?
Just talking.
If you knew her you'd understand.
She has a terrible temper.
She's always rebelled
against everything.
What did the other one say?
What other one?
Her husband.
He was a little nervous
but I calmed him down.
When he left
it was almost three.
She must be home by now.
Couples always fight at first.
I forgot: A friend came to see you,
the one who always seems
to be smiling.
Thaùs Dambiel.
He's waiting at the cafe.
You shoulÔve told me sooner.
Are you going out?
For five minutes, to see a friend.
FranÁois, my love, you're here!
I love you so.
I found myself alone in that room
and I was afraid.
Why?
I don't know why.
Afraid of dreaming you up.
Afraid of losing you.
I couldn't wait till tonight.
I'm here, darling.
Whaùs the meaning of this?
Do you need an explanation?
Will you stop taking me for a fool?
And yet iùs very clear.
Tell her, my darling.
I don't want to know.
At least you could shut the door.
No need to stir up the neighbors.
Well?
I've nothing to say to you.
I'm of age.
I love FranÁois and he loves me.
You talk about love!
Your loving husband was waiting
all night with razor in hand.
He was beside himself.
Mad with jealousy.
He threatened me.
He's out to get you.
To get me? My foot!
That asshole!
Look what he did to me!
Don't be so vulgar!
He's a brute, a sadist.
You mustn't see him again.
Thaùs enough from you.
Go join your friend.
- I'll be back.
- Hurry, darling.
You better find another room.
You better shut up.
Pay no attention to her.
Hurry on back.
- Where are you going?
- To my room.
Iùs no longer yours.
I don't give a damn.
I'm moving back.
With Guilbaud?
I'm not going to put up
with the two of you.
Edmond will kill you both
and me as well to top it off!
You won't protect me!
I'm helpless,
hounded, persecuted!
You'd still throw us
out in the street.
- You admit he's your lover?
- I never hid it.
- Where did you meet him?
- In the street.
- How long have you known him?
- None of your business.
I'd rather give you Philippe's room
than have you in the same bed
in my house.
I'm throwing him out anyway.
Then we'll both go.
Can't you understand
that I love him?
Don't you know what love is?
You take me for an idiot?
What passion is?
Or obsession?
You're telling me!
Nothing matters anymore.
I'm in love for the first time.
Words seem so empty
to express such a strong feeling.
I love his skin, his smell.
His strength,
his tenderness, his laugh.
I miss him one step away.
He must touch me,
he must have me.
He must take me away.
Nothing you may say
will make any difference.
I won't leave Guilbaud.
Never.
I'm out of a job and on strike.
Iùs pretty funny.
You seem optimistic.
I'm not going to cry.
There's no justice.
Justice?
Do you believe in it?
I believe in solidarity.
I also believe in friendship.
Maybe I'm too idealistic.
And maybe I'm wrong.
Leùs drink to us.
To friendship.
To friendship.
You look tired.
I had no sleep.
Something wonderful happened.
I know, I saw Violette.
It has nothing to do with Violette.
I never thought it possible.
I can't understand it myself.
I thought I loved Violette
but it wasn't love.
My life begins with Edith.
Iùs like new strength.
Strength to sustain me,
to keep on living.
What is it?
You don't believe me?
I was thinking of Violette.
Whaùll become of her?
I'll tell her.
We weren't really serious.
She was looking for you
this morning.
What did she want?
I don't know.
I'll see her tonight.
I'll talk to her.
Good morning, Madame.
Is FranÁois in?
He's on strike.
Thaùs why I thought he'd be in.
Well, you thought wrong.
- Who is it?
- Iùs for Guilbaud, not for you.
And don't ask me where he might be!
Could you tell him
that Violette would like to see him?
Iùs urgent.
No, wait. He might worry.
As you wish, mademoiselle.
Just tell him Violette stopped by.
Your father loved this sonata,
yet he had no ear for music.
Who rang?
Agirl named Violette.
She asked for Guilbaud.
What did she want?
None of my business.
Your Guilbaud
seems quite a Don Juan.
Spare me your comments, please.
Can I borrow this suitcase?
Where are you going?
- I'm off to EdmonÔs.
- Don't go!
- I need my belongings.
- Please don't go!
He's capable of anything.
He's a coward.
He'll get down on his knees.
He'll beg my forgiveness.
He'll beg me to stay.
Take it easy, I know him.
He was out of his mind.
He was there, in the hall.
I can see him now.
I'm in no danger.
The cards are on my side.
I fear the worst.
He might kill you.
I'm not taking chances.
Don't do it, Edith!
Leave the gun here.
Don't be ridiculous.
Everything must be settled.
For his sake and ours.
Please think it over.
I know what I'm doing.
Just like your father.
Thanks a lot.
What a pity. Violette is out.
She went to the store.
Please come in.
That might be her now.
I know her footsteps.
You're coming in?
I'd like to walk a little.
Will you stay for dinner?
I can't.
We have enough, you know.
Really, I can't.
Mother, I'm going for a walk
with FranÁois.
I looked for you all day.
Did they tell you?
Dambiel told me
you wanted to see me.
I called for you
at the old frump's.
Was it that urgent?
In a way, it was.
I had good news for you.
And I have bad news.
I was fired.
You scared me.
Iùs not really the end of the world.
You'll find another job.
Can't you guess?
I'm pregnant.
Are you sure?
Positive.
I'm so happy.
Do you realize?
Your child.
A little Guilbaud.
Whaùs wrong?
Say something.
Please answer me, FranÁois.
My little Violette, iùs not right.
I don't understand.
I had a speech prepared.
I didn't expect this.
Iùs not your fault.
Iùs not true! Look at me.
Iùs not true, is it?
My little Violette,
I don't want to hurt you.
I love another girl.
I don't want you to cry.
Iùs hard.
Shut up, FranÁois. Go away!
Iùs not my fault.
Listen to me.
Leave me alone, please.
It hurts too much.
I don't want to see you ever again.
Watch out, my man.
You'll get wet.
Don't bother to lock, Edmond.
I won't stay.
You're wrong, my sweet.
You won't leave.
I came to get my things.
I've forgiven you.
The slate is clean.
No questions asked.
I'm not jealous any more.
You won't understand.
Iùs over, I don't love you.
I want a divorce.
We'll start a new life together.
This time we'll be happy.
You must listen to me.
I am listening. I'm not joking.
I'm not cheating and I'll prove it.
What are you doing?
The bird won't leave the cage.
You're mad.
- You'll never leave me.
- You don't know me!
If you left me,
you'd be unhappy.
You'd regret it.
Keep talking.
My minÔs made up.
Don't do it!
Put that razor away!
You're scared.
You know I'm serious.
You're afraid to shoot.
Your hand shakes.
I'm not shaking.
Watch out, Edmond.
My love, my pretty whore.
I love you the way you are.
Stop this nonsense.
If you don't, I'll shoot.
My very own whore.
Shut up, I say!
You're mine, Edith.
Please stop!
You're mine
and you'll never forget me.
Oh, this stool!
Iùs so ugly.
Don't you think?
I should sell it.
I should get rid of all this.
Don't you agree?
- You've been drinking.
- Not really.
Is Edith here?
She's not back.
I tried to stop her
from making a terrible mistake.
What mistake?
My daughter a criminal!
Thaùs all I need!
Where is she?
She's at EdmonÔs.
Right into the lion's mouth.
- I'll go.
- I forbid you!
You're not yet
a member of the family.
And she won't be long now.
Thank you.
Have a drink with me.
Iùll cheer you up.
You've had enough.
You won't? Never mind.
You're smashed.
I find your language amusing.
Where did you get the idea?
Well, here's to your health,
my dear.
Iùs shocking when the bourgeoisie
lets its hair down.
The bourgeoisie can go to hell.
I'm not one of them.
I'll tell you something:
I like you better
than all the bourgeois.
Your are fighting for something,
for survival, just like myself.
The bourgeois are rotting away.
They wallow in their ways.
But I swear they won't have me.
Iùs horrible!
My child... What is it?
Please calm down.
Iùs blood! Are you hurt?
Say something!
Can't you see that I can't?
Give her your handkerchief.
She'll bleed to death.
I'm thirsty.
Get a glass of water.
Edmond slashed his throat.
How horrible!
He went mad when he saw me.
He called me names
and threatened me.
He circled around me
waving his razor.
Laughing, weeping.
I almost went crazy.
I took the gun out.
I wanted to scare him.
He stood before me and said:
"Edith, you're mine.
You'll never forget me."
Calm yourself, my darling.
I'll never forget his face, his cry.
Hold me in your arms, FranÁois.
I love you.
Please don't leave me.
I'm here, my love.
I love you.
Now I'm free.
Someone rang. You must hide.
You're covered in blood.
Who could it be?
I expect no one.
Stay here.
You're in no condition to walk.
Iùs you.
Am I intruding?
Not at all.
Iùs dark in here.
Can't see a word.
Is the Baroness in?
I don't know.
She must be in her room.
What is it?
Iùs about tomorrow.
We'll gather at the cathedral.
We'll go together.
I'll wait at the yard.
The cops will be there.
You O.K.?
Sure.
- Doesn't look it.
- Yes, I am.
- Have you seen Violette?
- I saw her.
She was sad.
Until tomorrow.
I found these in a closet.
In this house,
I relive my childhood.
A past I thought forgotten.
This doll was mine.
I made the dress.
Memories that make me
both happy
and sad,
move and disturb me.
Like you, FranÁois.
I love you so.
My life begins with you.
My happiness,
I owe to you.
You should be at work.
I don't want to see anyone.
I'm so disappointed.
Then come help me.
You shouldn't feel that way.
Iùs no fun to be rejected,
to feel abandoned.
Nothing to be done.
His decision may not be final.
I don't care about that.
I'll never see him again.
And the child?
I'll raise it.
You'll help me.
Together we'll find a way.
Where are you going?
To see that girl.
- What for?
- I just want to.
Come back, Violette.
Let dawn follow night,
and bring on a new day.
A day of light, at last,
of hope, peace and happiness.
Break it up! Go home!
We don't want any trouble.
Let us through!
We won't leave!
Disperse! Go back home!
Withdraw in orderly fashion.
Let us through.
We won't leave.
Let us come through.
We're here to fight for our rights.
Disperse! Go back home now!
Withdraw in orderly fashion.
There they go again.
There's more of them today.
Last time they used tear gas.
You couldn't breathe the air.
As usual,
Guilbaud is in the front line.
- I'm scared.
- You have nothing to worry about.
I'm afraid for FranÁois.
If something happened to him,
I couldn't go on.
If he were arrested,
I couldn't stand it.
If he died, I couldn't live on.
You love him that much?
He's indispensable to me.
I must know he's near me.
I need his warmth.
I couldn't go to sleep
without his caresses,
I couldn't wake up
without his smile.
I couldn't go on living.
Guilbaud is demonstrating.
I'm not here to see him.
What do you want then?
To see your daughter.
She's not to be seen now.
Are you Edith?
Who are you?
My name means nothing to you.
I'm a friend of FranÁois.
Has he ever told you about me?
Why should he?
I'm expecting his child.
Please, mademoiselle!
I have nothing to say to you!
You can be such a bore!
Let her speak.
You took FranÁois from me.
I'll keep the child.
Now we're even, you see.
None of my business.
Why are you here?
To see your face.
And I don't care to see yours.
I don't care
what happened between you two.
He loves me and I love him.
No arguments! No scenes!
Enough fighting already.
Will you shut up?
Iùs starting again.
They'll use tear gas.
Cops, scums!
Bums!
Don't come near!
End this demonstration!
Don't call us names!
What happened?
We must call an ambulance, quick.
Come.
How did it happen?
Two cops beat Menager.
FranÁois took them on.
He was clubbed himself.
He's lost a lot of blood.
He's coming to.
We mustn't move him.
Listen to me, Edith.
I'm here, my FranÁois.
I need you so.
You know how much I love you.
Don't leave me!
I'm going to die.
No, you won't die.
A doctor's coming.
He'll take care of you, you'll see.
Edith! Where are you?
I can't hear you any more.
You'll live for me!
Edith... my life...
Oh, FranÁois, my love.
I could never live without you.
Don't do it, Edith!
FranÁois, my love.
