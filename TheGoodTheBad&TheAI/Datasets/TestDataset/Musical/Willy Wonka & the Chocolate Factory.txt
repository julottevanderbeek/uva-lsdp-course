All right, what's it going to be?
A Triple Cream Cup for Christopher.
A Squelchy Snorter for Otis.
A Sizzler for June Marie. And listen.
BILL: Wonka's got a new one today.
CHILDREN: What is it?
This is called a Scrumdiddleumptious Bar.
Scrumdiddleumptious Bar?
How does he do it?
- My boy, do you ask a fish how it swims?
- No.
BILL: Or a bird how it flies?
No sirree, you don't.
They do it because they were born to do it.
Just like Willy Wonka
was born to be a candy man...
and you look like
you were born to be a Wonkerer.
The Candy Man.
The Candy Man can
'Cause he mixes it with love
Soak it in the sun
And make the strawberry-lemon pie?
CHILDREN: The Candy Man?
BILL: The Candy Man.
The Candy Man can.
The Candy Man can
'Cause he mixes it with love
Separate the sorrow
and collect up all the cream?
BILL: The Candy Man
CHILDREN: Willy Wonka can
The Candy Man can
'Cause he mixes it with love
CHARLIE: Hi, Mr. Jopeck.
MR. JOPECK: Come along, Charlie.
You're late.
CHARLIE: Lt's payday, Mr. Jopeck.
MR. JOPECK: You're right.
MR. JOPECK: There you are.
CHARLIE: Thanks.
Say hello to your Grandpa Joe.
CHARLIE: Okay.
THE TINKER: " Up the airy mountain
" Down the rushing glen
" We dare not go a-hunting
" For fear of little men"
You see, nobody ever goes in...
and nobody ever comes out.
Charlie's late.
He works too hard for a little boy.
GRANDPA: He should have
some time to play.
Not enough hours in the day.
MRS. BUCKET: With the four of you
bedridden for the past 20 years...
it takes a lot of work
to keep this family going.
If only his father were alive.
As soon as I get my strength back,
I'll get out of this bed and help him.
In all the years you've been saying
you'll get out of that bed...
Maybe if the floor wasn't so cold...
Hi, everybody.
Wake up, Charlie's home.
CHARLIE: Grandpa George.
CHARLIE: Grandma Georgina.
CHARLIE: Grandma Josephine.
CHARLIE: Grandpa Joe.
Is this your supper, Grandpa?
Lt's yours, too, Charlie.
I'm fed up with cabbage water.
It's not enough.
JOSEPHINE: Lt's all we have.
GRANDPA: What are you saying?
CHARLIE: How about this?
MRS. BUCKET: Where did you get that?
What difference does it make
where he got it? Point is, he got it.
- It's my first payday.
- Good for you. We'll have a real banquet.
CHARLIE: Mom, here's what's left.
You keep it.
Except for this.
From now on,
I'm going to pay for your tobacco.
No one's going to pay for it.
I'm giving it up.
Come on, Dad, it's only one pipe a day.
When a loaf of bread looks like a banquet,
I've no right buying tobacco.
Go on, Grandpa. Please take it.
CHARLIE: After I finished my paper route,
I was in front of Wonka's.
There was this strange man there.
I think he was a tinker.
He was standing right behind me
looking up at the factory.
" Nobody ever goes in,
and nobody ever comes out. "
And right he was, Charlie.
Not since the tragic day
that Willy Wonka locked it.
CHARLIE: Why did he lock it?
Because all the other chocolate makers
were sending in spies...
dressed as workers
to steal Mr. Wonka's secret recipes.
Especially Slugworth.
That Slugworth was the worst.
Finally, Mr. Wonka shouted,
" I shall be ruined! Close the factory. "
And that's just what he did.
He locked the gates
and vanished completely.
And then suddenly,
about three years later...
the most amazing thing happened.
The factory started working again,
full blast.
And more delicious candies
were coming out than ever before.
But the gates stayed locked,
so that no one...
not even Mr. Slugworth, could steal them.
But, Grandpa, someone must be helping
Mr. Wonka work the factory.
GRANDPA: Thousands
must be helping him.
But who? Who are they?
That is the biggest mystery of them all.
TURKENTINE: Charlie Bucket?
CHARLIE: Yes, sir?
TURKENTINE: I shall need an assistant.
Come and give me a hand.
and a special mixture of my own.
Together, it's horrible, dangerous stuff.
Blows you up.
But mixed together right, as only
I know how, what do you think it makes?
CHARLIE: I don't know.
TURKENTINE: Of course not...
because only I know.
If you knew, you'd be teaching me
instead of me teaching you.
And for a student to teach his teacher
is presumptuous and rude. Is that clear?
CHARLIE: Yes, sir.
TURKENTINE: Good.
Mixed together in the right way,
these three highly dangerous ingredients...
make the finest wart remover
in the world.
TURKENTINE: The trick is to pour them in
in equal amounts.
Charlie, you take the nitric acid
and the glycerin...
and I'll take my own special mixture.
Are you ready?
Good lad. Pour.
Did we do it wrong?
TURKENTINE: No, certainly not.
This is for very big warts.
What on earth's going on out there?
STUDENT 1: I hope there's still some left.
Winkelmann, come here.
What's happening?
Willy Wonka's opening his factory.
- He's gonna let people in.
- Are you sure?
Lt's on the radio.
And he's giving chocolates away.
Class dismissed.
Class un-dismissed.
He's hidden five Golden Tickets.
Whoever finds them wins the prize.
- Where's he hidden them?
- In five Wonka Bars.
- You've gotta buy them to find them.
- Class re-dismissed!
STUDENT 2: I'm going to buy
the whole store.
NEWSCASTER: Now, details
on the sudden announcement...
that has captured the attention
of the entire world.
Hidden among the countless billions
of Wonka Bars...
And to the five people who find them
will come the most fabulous prize:
A lifetime supply of chocolate.
each winner, before receiving his prize,
will be personally escorted...
They're all crazy.
GRANDPA: The man's a genius.
He'll sell a million bars.
Grandpa, do you think I've got a chance
to find one?
One? I'm counting on you to find all five.
One's enough for me.
NEWSCASTER: We have reports coming in
that the response is phenomenal.
Wonka Bars are disappearing
from candy store shelves...
the way that Wonkamania
has descended upon the globe.
While the world searches,
we watch and wait...
and how long the spirit of man will hold up
under the strain.
I'm still having these dreams, Doctor,
and I still can't stop believing them.
to believe in one's dreams
is a manifestation of insanity.
The sooner you accept this,
the sooner you'll get well.
But I dreamed the archangel appeared
and whispered into my ear...
and told me where to find
a Golden Wonka Ticket.
What exactly did he say?
What difference does that make?
This was a dream, a fantasy.
HOFFSTEDDER: You said-
DOCTOR: Just tell me where the ticket is!
Like five lucky bolts of lightning
ready to strike at any point on the map.
No one knew where or when
the first one would hit.
But as you all know,
last night we got our answer.
STANLEY: While we in America slept,
the first Golden Ticket was found...
in the small town of Duselheim, Germany.
We've been waiting several hours
for the follow-up story.
Proud we are,
for the attention of the entire world...
focuses today right here in Duselheim.
A community suddenly thrust
into prominence...
by the unexpected discovery
of the first Wonka Golden Ticket.
Its lucky finder is the son
of a most prominent butcher.
The boy's name, Augustus Gloop.
The pride of Duselheim,
the fame of Western Germany.
REPORTER 2: How do you feel
to be the first Golden Ticket finder?
AUGUSTUS: Hungry.
REPORTER 2: Any other feelings?
I feel sorry for Wonka.
It's gonna cost him a fortune in fudge.
REPORTER 1: Mr. Gloop,
would you mind saying-
REPORTER 2: Would you care to say
a few words to the television audience?
I just knew Augustus would find
a Golden Ticket. Eating is his hobby.
MRS. GLOOP: We encourage him.
He wouldn't do it
unless he needed the nourishment.
ALL: Happy birthday, Charlie!
MRS. BUCKET: Here you are, Charlie.
CHARLIE: Thank you.
It's terrific.
We each knitted a bit: Grandma Georgina,
Grandma Josephine, and me.
I did the end pieces with the little tassels.
And here's a little gift
from Grandpa George and me.
I think I know what this is.
- It is. A Wonka.
- Open it. Let's see that Golden Ticket.
- Wouldn't that be fantastic?
- Don't raise his hopes.
Never mind. Go on, open it.
I want to see that gold.
MRS. BUCKET: Stop it, Dad.
because you want it more.
- Go on, open it.
- Here goes.
- I got it!
- Where?
Let's see!
Fooled you, didn't I?
You thought I really had it.
Never mind, Charlie. You'll find one.
- Here, everybody have a bite.
- No.
VERUCA: I wanted to be the first
to find a Golden Ticket, Daddy.
MR. SALT: I know, angel.
We're doing the best we can.
I've got every girl on the bleeding staff
hunting for you.
Then where is it?
Why haven't they found it?
MR. SALT: Veruca, sweetheart,
I'm not a magician. Give me time!
I want it now!
What's the matter with those twerps?
For five days now,
the entire factory's been on the job!
They haven't shelled a peanut in there
since Monday!
They've been shelling
flaming chocolate bars from dawn to dusk!
Make them work nights.
MR. SALT: Come along, you girls!
MR. SALT: Put a jerk in it, or you'll be out
on your ears, all of you!
And listen to this,
the first girl that finds a Golden Ticket...
gets a £1 bonus in their pay packet!
What do you think of that?
VERUCA: They're not even trying.
They don't want to find it.
They're jealous of me.
Sweetheart, I can't push them no harder.
MR. SALT: 760,000 they've done so far.
VERUCA: You promised, Daddy.
You're going to be very unpopular, Henry,
if you don't deliver soon.
It breaks my heart, Henrietta.
I hate to see her unhappy.
I won't talk to you ever again.
You're a rotten, mean father!
You never give me anything I want!
- I won't go to school till I have it.
- Veruca, sweetheart, angel.
There are only four tickets left
in the whole world...
and the whole world's hunting for them!
What can I do?
VERUCA: About time, too! I want it!
I found a Golden Ticket!
Thank God.
Happiness is what counts with children.
Happiness and harmony.
REPORTER: This is the sign of our times.
The symbol of the havoc...
the mad craze
that's sweeping the world today.
Whatever corner of the globe we are in,
whichever continent we're on...
the great search for Wonka Bars
continues. We're nearing the end...
of our 43rd day
in the hunt for Golden Tickets.
And everywhere,
we're beginning to see signs of anxiety.
new shipments are being sent
to points around the globe.
As time passes, the men who seek them
become more and more desperate.
COMPUTER EXPERT: Gentlemen,
I know how anxious you've been...
during these last few days.
But now I think I can safely say...
that your time and money
have been well-spent.
We're about to witness
the greatest miracle of the Machine Age.
Based on the revolutionary
law of probability...
this machine will tell us
the precise location...
of the three remaining Golden Tickets.
It says,
" I won't tell. That would be cheating. "
I am now telling the computer...
that if it will tell me the correct answer,
I will gladly share with it...
the grand prize.
He says:
" What would a computer do
with a lifetime supply of chocolate?"
I am now telling the computer
exactly what he can do with the chocolate.
TV ANNOUNCER: It can happen
right here, too, unbelievable as it sounds...
Where even in the smallest town,
the happiest of dreams can come true.
Miss Violet Beauregarde,
finder of Golden Ticket number three.
Mr. Beauregarde,
a prominent local politician, a civic leader.
Sam Beauregarde,
'"Square Deal'" Sam to you...
The finest values you'll get
in the entire country.
SAM: This number here-
VIOLET: They don't want you!
- Care to say a few words?
- Sure I will.
Here is Golden Ticket number three,
and it's all mine.
I'm a gum chewer,
but when I heard about these tickets...
I laid off gum
and switched to candy bars instead.
I chew all day, except at meals,
when I stick it behind my ear.
MOTHER: Violet.
VIOLET: Cool it, Mother.
This is a piece of gum I've been chewing
on for three months solid. A world record.
It's beaten the record
held by my best friend, Cornelia...
Let me just butt in to say
if any of you folks watching...
Charlie, what are you doing here?
I thought if you were ready,
I'd walk you home.
I wish I were. Looks like
I'm going to be here late tonight.
CHARLIE: Then I guess I'll be going.
MRS. BUCKET: Stay for a minute.
Here. Pull up a pile of clothes
and sit down.
Everything all right at school?
CHARLIE: Yep.
MRS. BUCKET: Good.
Go on your newspaper route today?
CHARLIE: Just finished.
MRS. BUCKET: Good.
I wanted to tell you something.
CHARLIE: They found the third ticket today.
MRS. BUCKET: Did they?
I guess I'll be going now.
Is that all?
I thought you'd like to know.
Most people are pretty interested.
I know I'm interested.
There are only two tickets left, you know.
Just two.
CHARLIE: Pretty soon, just one.
I wonder who the lucky ones will be.
In case you're wondering, it won't be me.
Just in case you're wondering,
you can count me out.
There are 100 billion people in this world...
Even if you had a sackful of money,
you probably wouldn't find one.
After this is over, you'll be no different
from billions of others who didn't find one.
But I am different.
I want it more than any of them.
You'll get your chance.
One day things will change.
When? When will they change?
Probably when you least expect it.
See you later.
What happened to that smile
I used to know?
Till that day
You've got to stay strong, Charlie
Just follow it
And keep your dream in view
Pretty soon the sky
is gonna clear up, Charlie
NEWSCASTER: While the rest of the world
searches...
here in the Southwest,
it has actually happened.
That's what I said. There's only
one Golden Ticket left in the entire world.
Because right here, in our own community
of Marble Falls, Arizona...
is lucky winner number four.
The name soon to be heard
around the universe is Mr. Mike Teevee.
Are you crazy?
MRS. TEEVEE: He'll answer
during the break.
NEWSCASTER: The country
wants to hear from you.
Can't you shut up? I'm busy.
What a great show.
I serve all his TV dinners right here.
He's never even been to the table.
- You love to watch TV?
- You bet.
- What about that Golden Ticket-
- Hold it. I want to catch this.
REPORTER 1: Like the killings?
What do you think life's all about?
REPORTER 2: Mike, would you tell us if-
Wait till I get a real one. Colt.45.
- Pop won't let me have one yet, will you?
- Not till you're 12, Son.
Four down, one to go.
And somewhere out there,
another lucky person is moving closer...
to finding the last
of the most sought-after prizes in history.
Though we cannot help but envy him,
whoever he is...
and we might be tempted
to be bitter at our losing...
we must remember
there are many more important things.
Many more important things.
Offhand, I can't think of what they are,
but I'm sure there must be something.
Now for tomorrow's weather and...
CHARLIE: Why did you wake me up,
Grandpa? Is something wrong?
Grandpa, that money was for tobacco.
- One ticket left. Let's see that gold.
- No, you do it. I can't.
Something tells me
we're going to be lucky this time.
Which end shall I open first?
That end. Just a tiny bit.
- Like this?
- Now a bit more.
- You finish it. I can't.
- No, Grandpa. You do it.
All right. Here goes.
You know...
I bet those Golden Tickets
make the chocolate taste terrible.
AUCTIONEER: Lot 403.
I can personally guarantee,
ladies and gentlemen...
that this is the one and only,
the absolutely last case of Wonka Bars...
left in the United Kingdom.
Shall we start the bidding at £1,000?
Do I hear £1,000?
£4,000. £4,500. £5,000...
Your Majesty.
DETECTIVE: I'm sorry, Mrs. Curtis.
There's nothing in these papers
to give us a clue.
They kidnapped my husband 12 hours ago.
When will we hear from them?
What do they want?
Try to stay calm. They did it for ransom.
We must wait to hear their demands.
DETECTIVE: Go ahead, we're listening.
What did they asked for?
Whatever it is, they can have it.
They want your case of Wonka Bars.
Lt's your husband's life
or your case of Wonka Bars.
How long will they give me
to think it over?
That's it, it's all over.
The Wonka contest is all over.
The fifth and final ticket has been found.
We've got a live report coming in
directly from Paraguay, South America.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is finished.
The end has come.
The fifth and last Golden Ticket
has just been found...
the multimillionaire owner of gambling
casinos throughout South America.
Here is the most recent picture available
of the happy finder.
- The man who has finally...
- Turn it off.
Well, that's that.
- No more Golden Tickets.
- A lot of rubbish, the whole thing.
Not to Charlie, it wasn't.
A little boy needs something to hope for.
What's he got to hope for now?
GEORGINA: Who's going to tell him?
MRS. BUCKET: Let's not wake him.
He'll find out soon enough.
GRANDPA: Yeah, let him sleep.
Let him have one last dream.
I've just decided to switch
our Friday's schedule to Monday.
Which means Friday's test
on what we learned during the week...
will now take place on Monday
before we've learned it.
Since today's Tuesday,
it doesn't matter in the slightest.
TURKENTINE: Pencils ready.
Today we are going to learn about...
percentages.
For example, let's take
the recent unpleasantness.
Supposing that there were
and during the contest you each opened
a certain number of them.
That number is...
a percent. Everyone understand?
Madeline Durkin,
how many Wonka Bars did you open?
About 100.
There are ten 100s in 1,000.
Therefore, you opened 10%.
Peter Goff, how many did you open?
One hundred and fifty.
That's 10% half over again,
which makes 15%.
- Charlie Bucket, how many did you open?
- Two.
- That's easy. 200 is twice-
- Not 200.
Just two.
Two? What do you mean,
you only opened two?
I don't care very much for chocolate.
I can't figure out just two.
So let's pretend you opened 200.
If you opened 200 Wonka Bars,
apart from being dreadfully sick...
which is 15% half over again, 10%...
CHARLIE: I'd like a bar of chocolate, please.
BILL: Sure.
What kind?
A Slugworth Sizzler?
A Wonka Scrumdiddleumptious?
- Whichever is biggest.
- Try the Wonka Scrumdiddleumptious.
Now that the tickets have been found,
I don't have to hide them anymore.
Take it easy.
You'll get a stomachache
if you swallow it like that.
- Bye.
- Bye, now.
I think I'll buy just one more,
for my Grandpa Joe.
Sure.
Why not try
a regular Wonka Bar this time?
CHARLIE: Fine.
MR. JOPECK: Hear about the scandal.
MAN 1: Give me a newspaper.
MR. JOPECK: All right.
MR. JOPECK: Take it easy. One at a time.
MAN 2: Did you hear the news?
MAN 3: That gambler from Paraguay
made a phony ticket.
MAN 2: That means there's
one Golden Ticket still floating around.
MAN 3: Can you imagine the nerve
of that guy? Trying to fool the whole world.
MAN 2: He really was a crook.
This means the contest goes on forever.
You've got it!
You've got the last Golden Ticket!
The kid's found the last Golden Ticket!
MAN 4: Lt really is gold.
MR. JOPECK: Stand back. Leave him alone.
WOMAN: Let me see.
MR. JOPECK: You'll kill him.
Leave him alone.
MR. JOPECK: Break it up!
MAN 5: Show it over here.
MR. JOPECK: Come on, Charlie.
Hold on to the ticket.
MR. JOPECK: Run for it! Run straight home,
and don't stop till you get there!
I congratulate you, little boy. Well done.
May I introduce myself? Arthur Slugworth.
President of Slugworth Chocolates, Inc.
Listen carefully,
because I'm going to make you very rich.
Mr. Wonka is at this moment
working on a fantastic invention.
The Everlasting Gobstopper.
If he succeeds, he'll ruin me.
So I want you to get hold of
just one Everlasting Gobstopper...
and bring it to me
so that I can find the secret formula.
Your reward will be 10,000 of these.
Think it over, will you?
A new house for your family...
and good food and comfort
for the rest of their lives.
And don't forget the name:
Everlasting Gobstopper.
Look, everybody!
I've got it! The fifth Golden Ticket is mine!
You're pulling our legs, Charlie.
There aren't any more Golden Tickets.
No, Grandpa, the last one was a fake.
It said so in the papers.
I found some money, bought a Wonka Bar,
and the ticket was in it!
Look at it. See for yourself.
Read it, Joe, for heaven's sake.
" Greetings to you,
the lucky finder of this Golden Ticket...
" from Mr. Willy Wonka.
Present this ticket at the factory gates...
" at 10:00 in the morning on October 1,
and do not be late.
" You may bring with you one member
of your own family, but no one else.
" In your wildest dreams,
you could not imagine...
" the marvelous surprises that await you. "
GRANDPA: Charlie, you've done it!
MRS. BUCKET: I can't believe it.
It says I can take somebody with me.
I wish you could go.
That's good, Charlie. Now help me up.
CHARLIE: Are you okay?
GRANDPA: I'm fine, Charlie.
MRS. BUCKET: Easy, Dad.
JOSEPHINE: Joe!
JOSEPHINE: Watch it, Joe.
Look at me.
Look at me!
Up and about.
I haven't done this in 20 years.
Grandpa.
It's ours, Charlie.
Slippers, Charlie.
I never thought I'd see the day
When I would face the world and say
GRANDPA AND CHARLIE: '"Good morning,
look at the sun '"
GRANDPA: I never thought that I would be
Slap in the lap of luxury
The cane, Charlie.
GRANDPA: Here I go.
Watch my speed.
I never dreamed that I would climb
Over the moon in ecstasy
But nevertheless it's there
That I'm shortly about to be
GRANDPA AND CHARLIE:
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket
Good morning! Look at the sun!
GRANDPA AND CHARLIE:
Because I'd have said it couldn't be done
I never dreamed that I would climb
Over the moon in ecstasy
But nevertheless it's there
That I'm shortly about to be
GRANDPA AND CHARLIE:
I've got a Golden Ticket
Stop! Lt says October 1. That's tomorrow.
We've got a lot to do. Comb your hair,
wash your face, polish your shoes-
MRS. BUCKET: I'll take care of everything.
Grandpa, on the way home today,
I ran into Mr. Slugworth.
Hey, Mom, we're on TV.
Hi, everybody in Marble Falls!
Hi, Billy. Hi, Maggie. Hi, Fishface.
How do I look?
ANNOUNCER: You guys ready?
MAN: You're on.
This is the big day, folks.
The day Willy Wonka will open his gates
and shower gifts on the five lucky winners.
From everywhere, people have gathered
waiting for the hour to strike...
waiting to catch a glimpse
of that legendary magician, Willy Wonka.
Hi, Sam Beauregarde here. Don't forget
to visit Beauregarde's Auto Mart-
Cut it out, Dad!
For heaven's sake, this is my show.
Hi, Cornelia, sweetie. I've still got it.
How's this for a stretch?
- I want to go in first before anybody else.
- Anything you say, sweetheart.
Save some room for later,
Augustus, Liebling.
Grandpa, I don't believe it.
We did it. We're actually going in.
We're going to see
the greatest of them all, Mr. Willy Wonka.
WONKA: Thank you.
Welcome, my friends.
Welcome to my chocolate factory.
Would you come forward, please?
Get back, you.
Come on, Veruca, sweetheart.
That's Slugworth,
the man I told you about.
WONKA: Welcome.
It's nice to have you here.
I'm so glad you could come.
This is going to be such an exciting day.
I hope you enjoy it.
I think you will.
And now would you please show me
your Golden Tickets?
I'm Veruca Salt.
My dear Veruca, what a pleasure.
- You look pretty in that lovely mink coat.
- I've got three others at home.
Mr. Salt, overjoyed to see you, sir.
Would you just step over there?
- Augustus Gloop.
- Augustus, my dear boy.
How good to see you,
and in such fine shape.
This must be the radiant Mrs. Gloop.
Just over there, dear lady.
Violet Beauregarde.
WONKA: Darling child.
Welcome to Wonka's.
VIOLET: What kind of gum you got here?
WONKA: Charming.
- Sam Beauregarde here.
- My dear sir, what a genuine pleasure.
Any automotive needs, call on Sam.
Phone number's on the card.
" With Sam B., it's a guarantee. "
I'm Mike Teevee.
MIKE: Wham, you're dead!
WONKA: Wonderful to meet you, Mike.
WONKA: Mrs. Teevee, how do you do?
- What an adorable boy you have.
- Thank you.
- Just over there.
- Charlie Bucket.
WONKA: I read about you in
the papers. I'm happy for you. Who's this?
CHARLIE: My grandfather, Grandpa Joe.
WONKA: Delighted to meet you.
Overjoyed. Enraptured. Entranced.
Are we ready? Yes. Good. In we go.
Hats, coats, galoshes over here.
But hurry, please.
We have so much time and so little to see.
Wait a minute. Strike that.
Reverse it. Thank you.
VIOLET: When do I get my chocolate?
SAM: First take off your coat, Violet.
MIKE: Boy, what weird-looking
coat hangers.
Little surprises around every corner,
but nothing dangerous. Don't be alarmed.
As soon as your outer vestments
are in hand, we'll begin.
Now, will the children kindly step up here.
VIOLET: Accidents? What kind
of accidents?
MRS. TEEVEE: I didn't know
we had to sign for this tour.
VIOLET: I can't see what it says
in the bottom.
Violet, you first.
WONKA: Sign here.
SAM: Hold it.
SAM: Let me through.
Violet, don't sign anything.
- What's this all about?
- Standard formal contract.
Don't talk to me about contracts,
I use them myself. They're for suckers.
You wouldn't begrudge me
a little protection? A drop?
I don't sign anything without my lawyer.
MR. SALT: Veruca
don't sign anything, either.
Then she don't go in.
I'm sorry. Rules of the house.
I want to go in. Don't you dare stop me.
MR. SALT: I'm only trying to help you.
Give me that pen.
You're always making things difficult.
Nicely handled, Veruca.
She's a girl who knows where she's going.
What's all that small print at the bottom?
Lf you have any problems,
dial information. Thank you for calling.
MRS. TEEVEE: I assume there's
an accident indemnity clause?
Never between friends.
Saw this in a movie once.
A guy signed his wife's insurance policy.
- Then he bumped her off.
- Clever.
- What about me, Grandpa?
- Sign away. We've got nothing to lose.
VERUCA: Let's go in. Come on.
Patience, little dear.
Everything has to be in order.
Everyone signed? Yes?
Good. On we go.
WONKA: Ninety-nine...
forty-four...
Just through the other door, please.
MR. SALT: There's some mistake here.
MIKE: There is no other door.
- There's no way out.
- I know there's a door here someplace.
SAM: I don't like this, Wonka.
MR. SALT: Is this a trick or something?
Mr. Wonka, help!
I'm getting squashed. Save me.
Is it my soul that calls upon my name?
Let me out or I'll scream!
- Somebody's touching me.
- Now look here, Wonka!
Questions at the end of the session.
We must press on. Come along.
WONKA: Here we are.
SAM: Don't be a fool.
That's the way we came in.
It is? Are you sure?
How do you like that?
WONKA: There we are.
MR. SALT: What is this, Wonka?
- Some kind of fun house?
- Why? Having fun?
- I'm not going in there.
- Come, Violet, we're getting out of here.
You can't get out backwards.
You got to go forwards to go back.
Better press on.
MIKE: The room is getting smaller.
MRS. TEEVEE: Lt's not.
MRS. TEEVEE: He's getting bigger.
MR. SALT: He's at it again.
VIOLET: Where's the chocolate?
SAM: I doubt if there is any.
I doubt if any of us
will get out of here alive.
You should never doubt
what nobody is sure about.
You're not squeezing me
through that tiny door.
You're off your nut.
No one can get through there.
My dear friends, you are now
about to enter the nerve center...
to the entire Wonka factory.
Inside this room,
all of my dreams become realities.
And some of my realities become dreams.
And almost everything you'll see
is eatable, edible.
I mean, you can eat almost everything.
Let me in, I'm starving.
Don't get overexcited.
Don't lose your head, Augustus.
We wouldn't want anyone to lose that.
Yet.
WONKA: Now, the combination.
This is a musical lock.
Rachmaninoff.
WONKA: Ladies and gentlemen...
boys and girls...
the Chocolate Room.
WONKA: Hold your breath. Make a wish.
SAM: Hurry up, Violet.
CHARLIE: This way, Grandpa.
MRS. GLOOP: What a disgusting,
dirty river.
It's industrial waste.
You've ruined your watershed, Wonka.
It's polluted.
- It's chocolate.
- That's chocolate?
That's chocolate.
A chocolate river.
GRANDPA: That's the most fantastic thing
I've ever seen.
WONKA: 10,000 gallons an hour.
And look at my waterfall.
That's the most important thing.
It's mixing my chocolate.
It's actually churning my chocolate.
No other factory in the world
mixes its chocolate by waterfall.
But it's the only way
if you want it just right.
Grandpa, look over there across the river.
They're little men.
GRANDPA: Jumping crocodiles, Charlie!
Now we know who makes the chocolates.
MR. SALT: I never saw anybody
with an orange face before.
MR. SALT: Aren't they funny-looking?
MRS. TEEVEE: What are they doing there?
WONKA: Creaming and sugaring time.
VIOLET: They can't be real people.
WONKA: Of course they are.
MR. SALT: Stuff and nonsense!
No, Oompa Loompas.
- From Loompaland.
- Loompaland? There's no such place.
- Excuse me, dear lady-
- I am a geography teacher.
Then you know all about it
and what a terrible country it is.
Nothing but desolate wastes
and fierce beasts.
The poor little Oompa Loompas
were so small and helpless...
they would get gobbled up right and left.
A Wangdoodle would eat 10 of them
for breakfast and think nothing of it.
And so I said:
" Come and live with me
in peace and safety...
" away from all the Wangdoodles
and Hornswogglers...
" and Snozzwangers
and rotten Vermicious Knids. "
Snozzwangers? Vermicious Knids?
What kind of rubbish is that?
I'm sorry, but all questions
must be submitted in writing.
So, in the greatest of secrecy...
I transported the entire population
of Oompa Loompas to my factory.
I want an Oompa Loompa.
I want you to get me one right away.
All right, I'll get you one
before the day's out.
I want an Oompa Loompa now.
VIOLET: Can it, you nit!
AUGUSTUS: This stuff is terrific.
CHARLIE: Look at Augustus.
GRANDPA: Don't worry, he can't drink it all.
Augustus, sweetheart,
save some room for later.
Please don't do that. My chocolate
must never be touched by human hands.
Don't do that!
You're contaminating my entire river.
Please, I beg you! Augustus!
WONKA: My chocolate!
AUGUSTUS: Help!
My chocolate. My beautiful chocolate.
MRS. GLOOP: Don't just stand there.
Do something!
Help. Police. Murder.
GRANDPA: Quick, Charlie. Here.
CHARLIE: Quick, Augustus, grab this.
MRS. TEEVEE: What's happening to him?
MR. SALT: He's drowning.
MRS. GLOOP: Dive in. Save him!
Lt's too late.
- Too late?
- He's had it now. The suction's got him.
MRS. GLOOP: Augustus, come back!
- Where is he?
- Watch the pipe.
VERUCA: How long is he going to
stay down, Daddy?
MRS. GLOOP: He can't swim.
WONKA: There's no better time to learn.
MIKE: His coat's going up the pipe.
SAM: Call a plumber.
MR. SALT: He's stuck in the pipe, isn't he?
- It's his stomach that's done that.
- Help!
VIOLET: He's blocking the chocolate.
GRANDPA: What happens now?
The pressure will get him out.
It's building up behind the blockage.
MR. SALT: How long is it going to take
to push through?
The suspense is terrible. I hope it'll last.
MR. SALT: Go on, boy.
CHARLIE: He'll never get out.
GRANDPA: Yes, he will. Watch.
Remember you once asked me
how a bullet comes out of a gun?
He'll be made into marshmallows
in five seconds.
- Impossible. That's absurd, unthinkable.
- Why?
Because that pipe goes
to the Fudge Room.
MRS. GLOOP: You terrible man.
Take Mrs. Gloop to the Fudge Room,
but look sharp...
or her boy will get poured into the boiler.
You boiled him up, I know it.
Nil desperandum, dear lady. Across
the desert lies the Promised Land.
WONKA: Goodbye, Mrs. Gloop.
WONKA: Adieu. Auf Wiedersehen.
Gesundheit. Farewell.
What do you get
when you guzzle down sweets?
What kind of place
are you running here, anyhow, Wonka?
What's he talking about?
Wow, what a boat!
Looks good enough to eat.
That's quite a nice little canoe
you've got there.
" All I ask is a tall ship
and a star to sail her by"
WONKA: All aboard, everybody.
MR. SALT: Ladies first. That means Veruca.
If she's a lady, I'm a Vermicious Knid.
- You sure this thing will float?
- With your buoyancy, rest assured.
Nothing to worry about, my dear lady.
I take good care of my guests.
- You took good care of that August kid.
- Everybody aboard.
Daddy, I want a boat like this.
A beautiful paddle boat.
What she wants
is a good kick in the pants.
I'm going to be seasick.
WONKA: Try this.
MRS. TEEVEE: What are they?
WONKA: Rainbow drops.
You can spit in seven colors.
Spitting's a dirty habit.
I know a worse one.
- What business are you in, Salt?
- Nuts.
MR. SALT: Where are we going?
SAM: I don't like that tunnel.
I want off.
" Around the world and home again
That's the sailor's way! "
VERUCA: I don't like this ride, Daddy.
WONKA: Faster!
MRS. TEEVEE: We're going too fast.
VIOLET: We're going to sink, I know it.
VERUCA: Why doesn't he stop the boat?
WONKA: Faster!
MR. SALT: Close your eyes
and hang on tight.
- What is this, a freak-out?
- This isn't funny, Wonka!
You can't possibly see where you're going.
You're right. I can't.
MIKE: Boy, what a great series
this would make.
- This is kind of strange.
- Yes, strange, Charlie. But it's fun.
CHARLIE: This is terrific.
MR. SALT: I'd like to get off the boat,
Wonka!
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- This has gone too far.
Tell that little guy to turn us around!
Now I am going to be sick.
There's no earthly way
of knowing
He's singing.
Not a speck of light is showing
So the danger must be growing
The danger must be growing
For the rowers keep on rowing
Make him stop, Daddy!
MR. SALT: Lt's gone far enough!
WONKA: Quite right.
Stop the boat!
WONKA: We're there.
MRS. TEEVEE: Where?
Here.
A small step for mankind,
but a giant step for us.
- All ashore.
- Let me off this freight.
MIKE: Why don't they show stuff like that
on TV?
- What a nightmare.
- Daddy, I do not want a boat like this.
CHARLIE: " Dairy Cream. "
BOTH: " Hair cream"?
That's not French.
I can't take much more of this.
Now remember, no messing about.
No touching, no tasting, no telling.
GRANDPA: No telling what?
All of my most secret inventions
are cooking and simmering in here.
Old Slugworth would give his false teeth
to get inside for five minutes.
So don't touch a thing.
Inventing Room?
Looks more like a Turkish bath to me.
Even if Slugworth did get in here,
he couldn't find anything.
- You got a garbage strike going on?
- Who does your cleaning up?
Shouldn't you wear rubber gloves?
You'll have the health inspectors after you.
Invention, my dear friends,
is 93% perspiration...
and 2% butterscotch ripple.
MRS. TEEVEE: That's 105%.
MR. SALT: Any good?
Yes.
Excuse me.
Time is a precious thing. Never waste it.
- He's absolutely bonkers.
- That's not bad.
WONKA: " In spring time
The only pretty ring time
" Birds sing, hey ding a ding, ding
I told you not to, silly boy.
Your teeth!
Boy, that's great stuff.
That's exploding candy for your enemies.
Great idea, isn't it?
Not ready yet, though. Still too weak.
Needs more gelignite.
What's that for?
Gives it a little kick.
Butterscotch? Buttergin?
WONKA: " Candy is dandy
but liquor is quicker. "
MIKE: What's the matter?
Too hot, Mr. Wonka?
Too cold. Far too cold.
MR. SALT: That's gourmet cooking for you.
No! Don't, please.
Forgive me,
but no one must look under there.
This is the most secret machine
in my entire factory.
WONKA: This will sizzle old Slugworth.
CHARLIE: What does it do?
Would you like to see?
CHARLIE: But what does it do?
Can't you see?
Lt makes Everlasting Gobstoppers.
VIOLET: Did you say
Everlasting Gobstoppers?
For children with very little pocket money.
You can suck them forever.
I want an Everlasting Gobstopper.
- Me, too.
- And me.
Fantastic invention.
Revolutionize the industry.
You can suck them and suck them
and they'll never get any smaller. Never.
At least, I don't think so.
WONKA: Few more tests.
MIKE: How do you make them?
I'm a trifle deaf in this ear.
Speak a little louder next time.
WONKA: Who wants
an Everlasting Gobstopper?
CHILDREN: I do.
I can only give them to you
if you swear to keep them for yourselves...
and never show them to another
living soul as long as you all shall live.
WONKA: Agreed?
CHILDREN: Agreed.
Good. One for you,
and one for you, and one for you.
What about Charlie?
WONKA: And one for Charlie.
She's got two. I want another one.
VIOLET: Stop squawking, you twit!
WONKA: Everybody has had one.
And one is enough for anybody.
Now come along.
WONKA: Over here, if you'll follow me...
I have something rather special
to show you.
MR. SALT: Lt's special, all right.
I only hope my Veruca doesn't want one.
MIKE: What a contraption.
WONKA: Isn't she scrumptious?
She's my revolutionary,
non-pollutionary mechanical wonder.
Button, button, who's got the button?
CHARLIE: Lt's over there.
WONKA: Here?
CHARLIE: Yeah.
WONKA: What you are witnessing,
dear friends...
is the most enormous miracle
of the Machine Age.
WONKA: Finito.
VERUCA: That's all?
Don't you know what this is?
VIOLET: By gum, it's gum!
WONKA: Wrong.
It's the most amazing, fabulous,
sensational gum in the whole world.
What's so fab about it?
- This tiny gum is a three-course dinner.
- Bull.
WONKA: Roast beef, it's not quite right yet.
VIOLET: I don't care.
I wouldn't do that. I really wouldn't.
So long as it's gum, that's for me.
Violet, don't do anything stupid.
What's it taste like?
Madness! Lt's tomato soup.
It's hot and creamy.
I can feel it running down my throat.
Stop. Don't.
- Why doesn't she listen to Mr. Wonka?
- Because, Charlie, she's a nitwit.
This sure is great soup.
The second course is coming up.
Roast beef and a baked potato.
With sour cream?
SAM: What's for dessert, baby?
VIOLET: Dessert? Here it comes.
Blueberry pie and cream.
It's the most marvelous pie I've tasted.
SAM: Holy Toledo!
What's happening to your face?
Cool it, Dad. Let me finish.
But your face is turning blue.
SAM: You're turning violet, Violet!
VIOLET: What are you talking about?
I told you I hadn't got it right yet.
You can say that again.
Look what it's done to my kid.
It always goes wrong
when we come to the dessert. Always.
Violet, what are you doing now?
- You're blowing up!
- I feel funny!
GRANDPA: I'm not surprised.
VIOLET: What's happening?
SAM: You're blowing up!
WONKA: Like a blueberry.
SAM: Call a doctor!
MRS. TEEVEE: Stick her with a pin.
CHARLIE: She'll pop.
WONKA: Lt happens every time.
- They all become blueberries.
- You've really done it this time!
I'll break you for this.
- Well, I'll get it right in the end.
- Help!
SAM: Let the air out of her quick.
WONKA: There's no air.
- That's juice.
- Juice?
Would you roll the young lady
down to the juicing room at once?
SAM: What for?
WONKA: For squeezing.
She has to be squeezed immediately
before she explodes.
- Explodes?
- It's a fairly simple operation.
Gum chewing's fine
When it's once in a while
It stops you from smoking
And brightens your smile
I'll get even with you for this,
if it's the last thing I ever do!
I got a blueberry for a daughter.
" Where is fancy bred,
In the heart or in the head?"
Shall we roll on?
WONKA: Thank you.
Well, well, two naughty,
nasty little children gone.
Three good, sweet little children left.
WONKA: Hurry, please. Long way to go yet.
Wait a minute. I must show you this.
Lickable wallpaper for nursery walls.
Lick an orange, it tastes like an orange.
Lick a pineapple, it tastes like a pineapple.
Go ahead, try it.
MRS. TEEVEE: I got a plum.
CHARLIE: Grandpa, this banana's fantastic.
It tastes so real.
Try some more.
The strawberries taste like strawberries.
The snozzberries taste like snozzberries.
Snozzberries?
Whoever heard of a snozzberry?
" We are the music makers.
" And we are the dreamers of dreams. "
Come along.
Something very unusual in here.
WONKA: Bubbles, bubbles everywhere,
but not a drop to drink.
WONKA: Yet.
CHARLIE: What's it making, Mr. Wonka?
WONKA: Fizzy-Lifting drinks.
They fill you with gas...
and the gas is so lifting, that it lifts you
right off the ground like a balloon.
VERUCA: Isn't it high? Gosh!
- But I dare not sell it yet. It's too powerful.
- Let us try some, please.
No, absolutely not. There'd be children
floating around all over the place.
Come along, don't hang about.
Let's take a drink. Nobody's watching.
A small one won't hurt us.
Not bad.
Well?
Nothing's happening.
GRANDPA: You're right, Charlie.
I can't understand why.
I feel terribly strange.
- What do we do now?
- I don't know, Charlie.
We're in big trouble.
Mr. Wonka isn't going to like this.
We can't stay up here all day.
- You're right but-
- I'll try and get down.
All right, Charlie,
but please be very careful.
It's fun, Grandpa. It works.
Come on in, the air's fine.
- I haven't been swimming in 20 years.
- Give me your hand.
I don't think I ought to.
This is great!
CHARLIE: Try this, Grandpa.
GRANDPA: All right, Charlie. Wait for me.
GRANDPA: I'm a shooting star.
CHARLIE: I'm a rocket!
This is really great.
Look, I'm a bird!
GRANDPA: I feel light as a feather.
Look down. We're really high now.
Watch this, Grandpa.
Wonderful, Charlie.
- Try it, Grandpa.
- I don't know.
- Come on, Grandpa.
- All right.
You did it, Grandpa!
I think I hit an air pocket.
You can fly to the moon this way.
GRANDPA: Let's just fly south
for the winter.
CHARLIE: Why not?
- I'm a bird!
- I'm a plane!
I'm...
going too high!
Grandpa, I can't get down!
Help! Grandpa, the fan!
GRANDPA: Stay away from it!
Lt'll chop us to bits!
GRANDPA: We're in trouble! I can't stop!
CHARLIE: Lt's pulling me in!
GRANDPA: I can't stop!
CHARLIE: What do we do?
GRANDPA: Grab hold of something quick!
CHARLIE: There's nothing
to grab on to! Help!
CHARLIE: We're gonna get killed!
GRANDPA: Help!
Mr. Wonka, please! Turn off the fan!
I'm going down. Quick, Charlie, burp!
CHARLIE: I can't! Help!
That's wonderful, Charlie.
GRANDPA: Grab on to me.
We're going to be all right now.
Good boy.
From now on,
we keep our feet on the ground.
Let's catch up to the others.
I know what you're thinking.
They can't be doing what they're doing.
I haven't met the Oompa Loompa yet
who could do it.
WONKA: These are the geese
that lay the golden eggs.
WONKA: They're larger
than ordinary geese.
WONKA: In fact, they're quadruple-size
geese which produce octuple-size eggs.
WONKA: They're laying overtime for Easter.
But Easter's over.
They don't know that.
I'm trying to get ahead for next year.
MR. SALT: What happens
if they drop one of those eggs?
WONKA: An omelet fit for a king, sir.
VERUCA: Are they chocolate eggs?
Golden chocolate eggs.
That's a great delicacy.
But don't get too close.
The geese are temperamental.
So we have the Eggdicator.
MRS. TEEVEE: Egg-di-what?
WONKA: The Eggdicator.
It can tell the difference
between a good egg...
and a bad egg.
If it's a good egg, it's shined up
and shipped out all over the world.
But if it's a bad egg...
down the chute.
- It's an educated Eggdicator.
- It's a lot of nonsense.
VERUCA: Daddy, I want a golden goose.
CHARLIE: Here we go again.
MR. SALT: All right, sweetheart.
You'll get one as soon as we get home.
No, I want one of those.
How much do you want for the goose?
WONKA: They're not for sale.
MR. SALT: Name your price.
WONKA: She can't have one.
VERUCA: Who says so?
- The man with the funny hat.
- I want one. I want a golden goose.
Gooses. Geeses.
I want my geese
to lay golden eggs for Easter.
MR. SALT: Lt will, dear.
VERUCA: At least 100 a day.
MR. SALT: Anything you say.
VERUCA: And by the way...
VERUCA: I want a feast.
MR. SALT: You ate before you came here.
One of those.
Cream buns and doughnuts
And fruitcake with no nuts
- You'll have them when you get home.
- No, now. I want a ball.
Now.
I want to lock it all up in my pocket
It's my bar of chocolate
I want to wear them
Like braids in my hair
Presents and prizes
And sweets and surprises
Of all shapes and sizes
And now
Don't care how
I want it now
She was a bad egg.
Where's she gone?
Where all the other bad eggs go.
Down the garbage chute.
The garbage chute?
- Where does it lead to?
- To the furnace.
The furnace?
- She'll be sizzled like a sausage.
- Not necessarily.
She could be stuck inside the tube.
Hold on!
MR. SALT: Veruca, sweetheart.
Daddy's coming!
There's gonna be a lot of garbage today.
Mr. Salt finally got what he wanted.
- What's that?
- Veruca went first.
CHARLIE: Mr. Wonka, they won't really
be burned in the furnace, will they?
I think that furnace is lit
only every other day.
WONKA: I can't understand.
The children are disappearing like rabbits.
Well, we still have each other.
Shall we press on?
Can't we sit down for a minute?
- The pace is killing me.
- Transportation has been arranged.
WONKA: Behold the Wonkamobile.
" A thing of beauty is a joy forever. "
WONKA: Places, please.
The dance is about to begin.
WONKA: Better grab a seat,
they're going fast.
GRANDPA: What's that
they're filling it up with?
Ginger ale, ginger pop,
ginger beer, beer bubbles...
bubbleade, bubble cola, double cola,
double-bubble burp-a-cola...
and all that crazy carbonated stuff
that tickles your nose.
Few people realize
the tremendous power in those things.
I'm sorry I asked.
You think Slugworth would
pay extra to know about this?
Just keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.
WONKA: Everybody set?
CHARLIE: Is this gonna go fast?
Lt should. It's got more gas in it
than a politician.
Hold on tight. I'm going to open her up
and see what she can do.
WONKA: " Swifter than eagles...
" stronger than lions! "
MIKE: Lt's getting in my eyes!
MRS. TEEVEE: Lt's seeping in my shoes!
MRS. TEEVEE: I'm soaked!
Lt'll never come out!
MIKE: Lt's sticking to my gun.
My dress! My hair! My face!
MRS. TEEVEE: I'm sending you
the cleaning bill, Mr. Wonka.
MRS. TEEVEE: I'm dry cleaned.
Grandpa, what was that
we just went through?
Hsaw Aknow.
MRS. TEEVEE: Is that Japanese?
No, " Wonka Wash" spelled backwards.
WONKA: That's it. The journey's over.
GRANDPA: Finest bath I've had in 20 years.
CHARLIE: Let's do it again, Mr. Wonka.
- That's as far as it goes?
- Couldn't we have walked?
Lf the good Lord had intended us to walk,
he wouldn't have invented roller skates.
Would you all please put these on?
We have to be very careful.
There's dangerous stuff inside.
WONKA: Wonkavision. My very latest
and greatest invention.
MIKE: Lt's television.
WONKA: Lt's Wonkavision.
I suppose you all know
how ordinary television works.
- You photograph-
- I do. You photograph something...
then it's split into millions of pieces...
that go whizzing through the air
and down to your TV set in the right order.
You should open your mouth a little wider
when you speak.
So I thought,
" If they can do it with a photograph...
" why can't I do it with a bar of chocolate?"
WONKA: I shall now send this chocolate
bar from one end of the room to the other.
It has to be big, because when
you transmit something by television...
it always ends up smaller
on the other end.
Goggles on, please.
WONKA: Lights, camera, action!
Where's the chocolate?
Lt's flying over our heads
in a million pieces.
WONKA: Now watch the screen.
WONKA: Here it comes.
WONKA: There it is.
- Take it.
- How can you take it? Lt's just a picture.
All right, you take it.
- It's real.
- Taste it. It's delicious. It's just smaller.
- It's perfect.
- It's unbelievable.
- It's a miracle.
- It's a TV dinner.
- It's Wonkavision.
- It could change the world.
Can you send other things?
MIKE: Not just chocolate.
WONKA: Anything you like.
- What about people?
- People?
I don't really know. I suppose I could.
Yes, I'm sure I could.
I'm pretty sure I could.
MIKE: Look! I'm going to be
the first person to be sent by television.
MRS. TEEVEE: Get away from that thing!
WONKA: Come back.
MIKE: Lights, camera, action!
Where are you?
GRANDPA: He's up there,
in a million pieces.
MRS. TEEVEE: Mike, are you there?
WONKA: No good shouting.
Watch the screen.
Mike? Why is he taking so long?
A million pieces take a long time
to put together.
MRS. TEEVEE: Where are they?
WONKA: There's something coming.
MRS. TEEVEE: Is it Mike?
WONKA: Lt's hard to tell but-
The little groover's getting smaller
by the minute.
MIKE: Look at me. I'm the first person
in the world to be sent by television.
Wow, what a wild trip that was.
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.
Am I coming in clear?
Mom, I said, am I coming in clear?
Great. He's completely unharmed.
You call that unharmed?
Wow, that was something.
Can I do it again?
MRS. TEEVEE: No, there'll be nothing left.
Don't worry about a thing, Mom.
I feel fine.
MIKE: I'm famous. I'm a TV star.
MIKE: Wait till the kids back home
hear about this.
MRS. TEEVEE: Nobody will.
Where are you taking me?
I don't want to go in there.
Be quiet. Well?
Fortunately, small boys
are extremely springy and elastic.
So I think we'll put him
in my special taffy-pulling machine.
That should do the trick.
To the Taffy-Pulling Room.
The boy is in his mother's purse.
But be extremely careful.
What's he saying?
No, I won't hold you responsible.
And now, my dearest lady,
it's time to say goodbye.
No, don't speak.
For some moments in life,
there are no words. Run along now.
" Parting is such sweet sorrow. "
So much to do: Invoices, bills, letters.
I must answer that note from the Queen.
What's gonna happen to the other kids?
Augustus and Veruca?
My dear boy, I promise you
they'll be quite all right.
When they leave here, they'll be restored
to their normal, terrible old selves.
But maybe they'll be
a little bit wiser for the wear.
Don't worry about it.
What do we do now, Mr. Wonka?
I hope you enjoyed yourselves.
Excuse me for not showing you out.
Straight up the stairs, you'll find it.
I'm busy. A whole day wasted.
Goodbye to you both.
What happened?
Did we do something wrong?
I don't know, Charlie.
But I'm going to find out.
GRANDPA: Mr. Wonka?
WONKA: I am extraordinarily busy, sir.
I just wanted to ask about the chocolate.
The lifetime supply of chocolate.
For Charlie.
When does he get it?
WONKA: He doesn't.
GRANDPA: Why not?
WONKA: Because he broke the rules.
What rules?
We didn't see any rules, did we?
Wrong, sir!
Under Section 37-B
of the contract signed by him...
it states quite clearly that
all offers shall become null and void if...
And you can read it for yourself
in this photostat copy:
" I, the undersigned...
" shall forfeit all rights,
privileges, and licenses...
" herein contained," etc.
'"Fax mentis incendium
gloriae culpum, '"etc.
It's all there, black and white,
clear as crystal!
You stole Fizzy-Lifting drinks!
You bumped into the ceiling which
now has to be washed and sterilized!
So you get nothing!
You lose!
Good day, sir!
You're a crook.
You're a cheat and a swindler,
that's what you are.
How can you do a thing like this?
Build up a little boy's hopes and
then smash all his dreams to pieces.
You're an inhuman monster!
I said, good day!
Come on, Charlie. Let's get out of here.
I'll get even with him
if it's the last thing I ever do.
If Slugworth wants a Gobstopper,
he'll get one.
Mr. Wonka.
WONKA: " So shines a good deed
in a weary world. "
Charlie.
My boy.
You did it!
I just knew you would!
Forgive me for putting you through this.
Please forgive me.
Come in, Mr. Wilkinson.
Charlie, meet Mr. Wilkinson.
WILKINSON: Pleasure.
CHARLIE: Slugworth.
No, that's not Slugworth.
He works for me.
CHARLIE: For you?
WONKA: I had to test you, Charlie.
And you passed the test. You won!
GRANDPA: Won what?
WONKA: The jackpot, my dear sir.
WONKA: The grand and glorious jackpot.
CHARLIE: The chocolate?
The chocolate, yes.
But that's just the beginning.
We have to get on.
We have so much time and so little to do.
WONKA: Strike that. Reverse it.
This way, please.
We'll take the Wonkavator.
Step in, Charlie. Grandpa Joe, sir.
- This is the great glass Wonkavator.
- It's an elevator.
It's a Wonkavator.
An elevator only goes up and down.
But the Wonkavator goes sideways,
slantways, longways, back ways...
CHARLIE: And front ways?
WONKA:... and any other ways you think of.
It can take you to any room by pressing
one of these buttons. Any button.
Press a button and zing, you're off.
Except one.
WONKA: Go ahead, Charlie.
CHARLIE: Me?
There it goes.
I'm not exactly sure
what's going to happen.
Faster. If we don't pick up speed,
we won't get through.
CHARLIE: Get through what?
- You mean, we're going...
- Up and out.
But the roof is glass.
It'll shatter into a thousand pieces.
- We'll be cut to ribbons.
- Probably.
Here it comes.
GRANDPA: You did it. Congratulations.
WONKA: Get up, take a look.
Grandpa, our town looks so pretty
from up here.
GRANDPA: Look over here, Charlie.
I think I see our house.
GRANDPA: Lt really looks beautiful.
There's my school, Grandpa.
How did you like the chocolate factory?
I think it's the most wonderful place
in the whole world.
WONKA: I'm very pleased
to hear you say that...
because I'm giving it to you.
CHARLIE: What?
WONKA: That's all right, isn't it?
GRANDPA: You're giving Charlie-
WONKA: I can't go on forever.
WONKA: And I don't really want to try.
So who can I trust
to run the factory when I leave...
and take care
of the Oompa Loompas for me?
Not a grownup.
A grownup would want to do everything
his own way, not mine.
That's why I decided a long time ago
that I had to find a child.
A very honest, loving child...
to whom I can tell all my most precious
candy-making secrets.
CHARLIE: So, you sent the Golden Tickets?
WONKA: Right.
The factory's yours.
You can move in immediately.
GRANDPA: And me?
WONKA: Absolutely.
CHARLIE: What happens to the-
WONKA: The whole family.
I want you to bring them all.
But, Charlie...
don't forget what happened to the man
who suddenly got everything he wanted.
CHARLIE: What happened?
He lived happily ever after.
