When did you start cooking, Terri?
Oh, it's just hamburger casserole.
Look out for bones.
I'm sorry. I, uh...
I can't hold it in any longer. Um...
Mom, Dad...
- Terri's pregnant.
- What?
- It's a boy.
- Oh!
Our first grandbaby!
- Oh, that's fantastic.
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Sweetheart? Honey.
- Yeah?
I thought we weren't gonna tell anybody yet.
Your secret is safe with me.
I spent six months in the Hanoi Hilton.
- Never said a word. Am I right, Doodle?
- That's right, honey.
Oh.
Yeah, we're gonna
turn the craft room into the nursery.
- Oh! Show me!
- Okay.
I'm really happy for you, Son.
Tell you the truth, I'm terrified.
I... don't know how to do this.
No one does. Look at me. I was a mess.
I worked all the time, traveling.
I was too strict.
Okay, you're not instilling me
with a great deal of confidence here, Dad.
I mean, I'm already up all night
thinkin' about this.
That's my fault... uh, the confidence thing.
Boys learn that from their fathers.
I started at Zuckerman and Zuckerman in college.
I needed some extra cash.
I was saving up... for law school.
But I never went. I... never even applied.
Didn't have the balls.
So I settled for insurance.
I mean, who was I to become a lawyer?
You would've been a great one.
You're the smartest guy I know.
It's not about brains, Son.
Being a good father...
Hell, being a man is all about one thing.
Guts.
And you've got about six months
to figure out if you have any.
Step and step up. Just step and step.
You don't have to ask every time
for permission to go to the bathroom, Rachel.
- You can just go.
- It's not my bladder.
- It's the choreography.
- Okay, what's wrong with the choreography?
- It sucks.
- It's completely unoriginal.
Aren't you guys gonna get shunned
for talking to me?
Sweetie, we're a team now.
But you gotta do something about
Mr. Schue's dance routines.
We can't compete with Vocal Adrenaline
with these steps.
You're a great vocal coach, Mr. Schue...
That's what we need to be the best.
We need Dakota Stanley.
He's the best show choir choreographer
in the Midwest. He works with Vocal Adrenaline.
You can't take regionals without him.
He was the understudy to the candelabra
in Beauty and the Beast...
on Broadway.
Just because he understudied
doesn't mean he ever performed.
After high school. Did you even try?
- I-I just never had...
- The guts?
They say it takes
more certainty than talent to be a star.
I mean, look at, um... look at John Stamos.
I don't know. I guess I'm... also
just nervous about being a dad.
I want my kid to be proud of me.
I want to set a good example, you know?
I hope it's cool,
me unloading on you like this.
- l-l-I don't want there to be any awkwardness.
- Oh, no. No. None at all.
I mean, especially since we're...
we're both in relationships now, both of us.
- Right.
- I'm in a relationship. You're in a relationship.
- Exactly. Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
- H-How's it goin' with Ken?
- Great. It's great. It's wonderful.
I mean, you know, he's flawed, but he...
he knows who he is, and that's... that's great...
and there really is nothing sexier in a man
than... than confidence, you know?
- Huh?
- Huh.
Sandy. I thought you weren't allowed on campus.
No, William. I'm not allowed
within 50 feet of children.
Besides, Henri and I go way back.
I got him a job
before we even had a shop class.
Uh, I told Figgins that you are going to have
a school full of nancys...
unless you get some hot wood
in those teenagers' hands.
- Here comes Henri.
- Oh, shoot.
I'm back.
Henri had a little problem
with over-the-counter cough medicine.
He ended up cutting off his thumbs.
It was a real tragedy.
I'll never hitchhike across Europe.
That was a dream, man.
- Where's Terri?
- Doing inventory.
I can't count higher than 30.
You know, this is nice.
Can't remember the last time
I just hung out with the guys...
really talked about our feelings.
Wanna know what I'm feeling? I live at the YMCA.
I only have one pair of long pants.
Oh, please. My life is a disaster
with no creative outlet...
other than writing
my Desperate Housewives fan fiction.
I'm afraid of my vacuum.
I know how you guys feel.
I apparently don't know how to dance.
I don't have thumbs.
Uh...
Sorry.
¶¶ For he's a jolly good fellow ¶¶
¶¶ For he's the jolly good fellow ¶¶
¶¶ For he's the jolly good fellow ¶¶
¶¶ That nobody can deny ¶¶¶¶
Hey. That was pretty good.
¶¶ This is how we do it ¶¶
rehearsing a cappella hip-hop
in my living room was embarrassing.
But bustin' out some white-hot
new jack swing...
I'll tell you,
I've never felt more confident.
¶¶ This is how we do it
It's Friday night ¶¶
- Henri thought we should call our group...
- Crescendudes.
- while Ken thought...
- Testostertones.
was more manly, and then we heard a single
word leap Howard's lips...
Acafellas.
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille.
Sandy, we voted.
When you're in the group, it's creepy.
Wai... I...
¶¶ This is how we do it ¶¶
- ¶¶ This is how we do it ¶¶¶¶
- Will!
If I don't get some sleep, I could miscarry.
I'm sorry, Ter. Um... I'll be right in?
I hope so.
Being in a boy band
did wonders for our love life.
made my wife more attracted
to me in every way.
- He's not coming.
- What happened?
They're my famous sugar cookies.
I bake them for the poor
during Christmastime...
but I whipped up a special batch
just for you.
I wanted to say how sorry I was
for what I said.
Don't be. You were right.
You know, the truth is, Rachel,
if you weren't so hard on me...
I never would have had the guts
to start Acafellas.
But... We need you, Mr. Schue.
You've missed six rehearsals
in the past couple of weeks...
and when you're there,
you're not really there.
- Which is why I think you should
go ahead and hire Montana.
- Dakota.
Whatever.
to help you guys sing and stuff...
but, uh, I just don't have time
for all of it anymore.
Of course he doesn't want anything to do
with us after you kicked him in the 'nads!
Then why did he thank me?
The goal is to win,
and now that Mr. Schuester...
has agreed to let us hire
Dakota Stanley, we can.
But he doesn't want us to. He just doesn't
have the confidence to coach us anymore.
- Guys are real sensitive when
it comes to this kind of stuff.
- And that's my fault?
You see anyone else in here with a plate of
"I'm sorry" cookies? I don't. Just you.
I'm bored.
All those in favor of hiring Dakota Stanley...
Hey, wait up.
Y-You can't do this to Mr. Schuester.
What? Make him a hero?
Once we hire Dakota and win nationals,
he'll thank me for it.
- You heard Santana. It's all about winning.
- Since when?
Look, you have your popular clique
and your football...
and your cliché of a blonde girlfriend.
Glee is my one shot.
If this doesn't work out...
then my whole high school life
will be nothing but an embarrassment.
Wh-What's a "cliché"? Is that a bad thing?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Is this one of those chick things
where you're pissed about one thing...
but you're just pretending like
you're pissed about something else 'cause...
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, for a while there,
you were kind of all over me...
and now you just yell at me all the time.
Makes me think you're still upset
about what happened in the auditorium.
I'm not. I've moved on
and I'm focusing on my career now.
- D-Do you wanna talk about it?
- No.
And neither do you.
It's kind of ironic how you're Mr. Popular...
and I'm just this nobody
that everybody makes fun of.
But I have enough confidence
to say out loud...
that what happened between us
in the auditorium was real.
You have feelings for me
and you just don't have the guts to admit it.
We're hiring Dakota Stanley.
Even if it means me quitting?
Yes.
It's a good start.
You're sowing the seeds of destruction.
- Mr. Schuester
barely even shows up for rehearsals.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
"Barely" will not cut it. I will not be satisfied
until Glee Club is disbanded.
And what about this Dakota character?
Any chance he actually helps?
They're soft. He'll eat them alive.
I give them 15 minutes before the first one
quits or tries to commit suicide.
You know, ladies...
learned a lot in Special Forces.
I was on the strike team in Panama
when we extracted Noriega.
We took out the shepherd...
then we went after the sheep.
You need to go after
these Glee Clubbers one by one.
I want my full budget restored.
I need a fog machine.
- Have you ever kissed anybody?
- Yes...
if by "someone" you mean
the tender crook of my elbow.
No, I haven't.
But I want to.
Okay. Stop it right there, Mercedes.
We are in Glee Club.
That means we are at the bottom
of the social heap.
Special Ed kids
will get more play than we will.
The only thing that gets me by is my knowledge
that we are superior to all of them.
What are you wearing on our
Operation Dakota Stanley field trip?
- Is there a dress code?
- No, but every moment of your life...
is an opportunity for fashion.
We'll hit the mall after school.
Meet me at lunch.
Okay.
You should totally scoop that.
I don't think I'm his type.
Oh, I think you are.
Just follow our lead. We've got your back.
Poison!
Yeah, Spider-Man and Freeze in full effect.
- You ready, Ken?
- I'm ready.
- You ready, Henri?
- I'm ready, Will.
- Are you?
- Oh, yeah. Break it down.
- ¶¶ Yeah ¶¶
- ¶¶ Girl, I must ¶¶
- ¶¶ Warn you ¶¶
- ¶¶ I sense something strange in my mind ¶¶
- ¶¶ The situation is ¶¶
- ¶¶ Serious ¶¶
¶¶ Let's cure it 'cause
we're running out of time ¶¶
¶¶ Can't get her out of my head ¶¶
- ¶¶ Miss her, kiss her, love her ¶¶
- ¶¶ Wrong move, you're dead ¶¶
- ¶¶ That girl is ¶¶
- ¶¶ Poison ¶¶
- ¶¶ Whoa, whoa, oh, oh ¶¶
- ¶¶ Never trust a big butt and a smile ¶¶
- ¶¶ That girl is ¶¶
- ¶¶ Poison ¶¶
¶¶ Poison, deadly, movin' it slow ¶¶
¶¶ Lookin' for a mellow fellow like DeVoe ¶¶
¶¶ Gettin' paid, laid, so better lay low ¶¶
¶¶ Schemin' on the hots
My end, the pro show ¶¶
¶¶ Low pro ho
should be cut like an Afro ¶¶
¶¶ See what you're sayin' , huh
She weighin' you but I know she's a loser ¶¶
- ¶¶ How do you know ¶¶
- ¶¶ Me and the crew used to do her ¶¶¶¶
Yea, Ken! Ken Tanaka!
In my own little way,
I felt like I was finally...
Thank you so much.
Acafellas!
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Son!
This is huge! We just sold
all 17 copies of your CD.
I didn't even have to show
any of them my bosoms.
You know, honey? Go get yourself a Sanka.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Thanks, Mom. Good job.
I bought one for my grandson...
so he can hear for himself
how good his old man was.
- Ah.
- Schue!
That was an amazing performance!
Oh, thank you. I mean...
You know, we're just starting out, so...
Look, there's a P.T.A. meeting
next Thursday night...
and I want Acafellas to be the main event.
I need those parents happy!
They found out
we've been serving the children prison food.
Great job, Son.
- Well?
- "Is it too soon to call Will Schuester...
"the next Michael Bublé?
"The audience last Thursday
at Benchwarmers Sports Bar didn't think so.
"is like a cool fog that sweeps over
a deep ocean of emotional intensity.
"A big thumbs-up to Henri St. Pierre...
"who proves you don't need all 10 fingers
to pluck a lady's heartstrings...
Only Howard"...
Um, sorry, Howard.
They didn't say anything about you.
"Buckle up, Ohio.
Are you ready for a new musical sensation?
You'd better be,
because here come the Acafellas."
Yes!
Oh, congratulations
on your dead-tree valentine, gentlemen.
By the way, I want in.
Stop right there, William.
I've got two words for you.
Josh Groban.
- He's coming to the P.T.A. event.
- Who is Josh Groban?
Who is Josh Groban? Kill yourself!
He is an angel sent from heaven...
to deliver platinum records unto us.
And if he were here right now, I would club you
to death with his Critics' Choice Award.
- Why would he come to our show?
- Because I invited him.
Josh and I have become frequent pen pals...
since he accidentally friended me on MySpace.
he is only interested if I am in the group.
No, Sandy.
We have standards.
Okay. Fine.
But just so you know,
the blogs are all atwitter.
They say he's looking for an opening act.
Damn, Kurt. This car is fly.
My dad got it for my Sweet 16...
after I swore to stop wearing
form-fitting sweaters that stop at the knee.
What he doesn't know doesn't hurt him.
Are we even sure they're rehearsing today?
Vocal Adrenaline rehearses every day
from 2:30 until midnight.
I'm just so nervous these Vocal Adrenaline kids
are gonna laugh at us.
They're so cool and popular...
and we look like
we just stepped off the short bus.
Those sweaty Nazis have just had
more time to practice. We have more heart.
And you don't look touched in the head.
That outfit is amazing.
Guys, that's Andrea Cohen.
She won outstanding soloist...
last year in "Absolutely Tampastic."
You can't leave rehearsals for any reason.
That includes heat exhaustion
or Crohn's disease.
Are you guys Vocal Adrenaline?
We'd like to talk to Dakota Stanley...
about choreographing for our Glee Club.
Don't!
He's a monster.
¶¶ Hit the beat, take it to the verse now ¶¶
¶¶ Yeah, yeah, yeah
I love you, you, you ¶¶
¶¶ But I gotta stay true
Ooh, ooh ¶¶
¶¶ My morals got me on my knees
I'm beggin' please ¶¶
¶¶ Stop playin' games ¶¶
¶¶ I don't know what you do
but you do it well ¶¶
- ¶¶ I'm under your spell ¶¶
- ¶¶ I've got you under my spell ¶¶
- ¶¶ You got me begging you for mercy ¶¶
- ¶¶ Yeah, yeah, yeah ¶¶
- ¶¶ Why won't you release me ¶¶
- ¶¶ Yeah, yeah, yeah ¶¶
¶¶ Yes, I'm begging you for mercy ¶¶
- ¶¶ Why won't you release me ¶¶
- ¶¶ Mercy ¶¶
¶¶ I said release ¶¶
- ¶¶ Me ¶¶
- ¶¶ Yeah, yeah, yeah ¶¶
- ¶¶ You got me begging you for mercy ¶¶
- ¶¶ Yeah, yeah ¶¶
- ¶¶ Why won't you release me ¶¶
- ¶¶ Yeah, yeah ¶¶
¶¶ Give me some mercy ¶¶
¶¶ I said release ¶¶
- ¶¶ Me ¶¶
- ¶¶ Yeah, yeah, yeah ¶¶¶¶
Get off my stage!
Mr. Stanley,
we're the McKinley High Glee Club!
- No interviews!
- We'd like you to choreograph for us.
Look, my fee is $8,000 per number,
plus a $10,000 bonus if you place in the top three.
And with Dakota Stanley at the wheel,
you will place at the top three. Move it.
How are we gonna get $8,000?
Kick that way, and back.
- And kick out...
- Hold on.
- Okay. One more. Let me...
- Okay.
- Kick out...
- Kick...
Right behind you. It's all right.
Hey, where is everybody?
Uh, Sandy went to get Henri from wood shop, and...
Oh. There's Howard.
- Hello?
- I don't think I can be in the band anymore.
- What?
- Like doing inventory...
it was never my dream.
Howard's out.
Oh, that...
That's just great. What's he...
Hey, Emma.
You didn't, uh,
see me dancin' earlier, did you?
Oh, is that what that was?
- Look, I have some bad news.
- You're breakin' up with me.
- What, here, in front of another dude?
- No. Please stop talking.
Um, no. Look, I think
the Acafellas pressure...
has proven to be a little too much for Henri.
- Really? Why?
- Well, he just downed six bottles of cough syrup...
which is a lot, even for him.
Um, he's okay.
Sandy's in the emergency room with him now...
but Figgins is insisting before he comes back...
and can be around kids again...
that he goes to rehab,
so that's where he's going tomorrow morning.
That's just great.
So Acafellas is officially doomed now.
Do you know, uh...
When I get stressed, I... I work out.
You can probably tell. So I'm gonna, uh...
down some Power Bars, knock off a few reps,
come up with some solutions here.
It was fun while it lasted.
I don't think you should
give up so easy, Will.
You know, they said Van Halen was dead
after David Lee Roth quit...
but my worn-out single of"Right Now"
says that they were wrong.
You got a sec, Mr. Schue?
- Yeah, of course. What's up?
- I just wanted to tell you that I'm quitting Glee too.
Uh... I didn't quit Glee.
Well, you might as well have.
It's nutty in there.
I try and talk sense into Rachel,
but she's gone all chick batty.
I've gotta be honest with you.
It's hard bein' the quarterback
when I get in the huddle...
and all the guys are calling me Deep Throat.
Glee's bringing down my rep, man.
Have the guts to stick
with it a little bit longer.
You are a gifted performer, Finn.
You can't quit now. If you do, you're just
gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Trust me. I know.
It's just not fun anymore.
Hey, Finn. Wait.
There's something I wanna talk to you about.
- Hey, Coach.
- What do you want, Puckerman?
I hear there's a vacancy
in your a capella group.
I wanna offer my services.
I play guitar, and actually,
I'm a really good singer.
There are a lot of moms at your gigs, right?
Well, here's the thing
you should know about me.
I'm not like everybody else in this crappy
cow town. I've got star potential...
and more specifically, I'm tired of wasting
my time with high school girls.
You're breaking up with me. Why?
Your credit score is terrible.
What I need, as a woman,
is financial security.
See, young girls will shoot you down
and make you feel terrible about yourself.
Thanks, Mrs. H.
- Is that a nipple ring?
- Yeah. I'm kind of rock and roll.
I need your help unclogging my bathtub drain.
My aboveground pool cleaning business
went through the roof...
and gave these fine ladies
the romance they were missing.
When do we start rehearsals?
Now you listen to me, you little psychopath.
My love life is hanging by a thread,
and that thread is Acafellas.
It drives my girlfriend nuts in the pants.
So if you screw this up for me,
I swear to you...
I will stick my fist so far down your throat...
you will taste my armpit hairs!
Do I make myself clear? Good.
We rehearse Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8:00.
Don't be late.
Guys, stop. You guys got the steps down.
You just... need to relax, okay?
Um... You guys play baseball, right?
What does your coach tell you about hitting?
- You charge the pitcher, bring the bat.
- Okay. Um...
I'm sure he also tells you to relax, right?
'Cause hitting's all about the hips, right?
Gotta loosen 'em up.
Just swing that bat. All right.
Pretend... Acafellas, Madison Square Garden.
Here we are.
All those beautiful ladies out there.
Swing that big ol' bat. Bam!
Hit some home runs.
All right, guys? All right.
Let's try from the top, okay?
Here we go.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, get those hips into it.
Ha-ha! That's it! That's it. All right!
Uh!
- That baseball thing sure was good,
Mr. Schue. Totally.
- It was awesome.
We need to have a gayvention.
That's a gay intervention.
It's obvious you like him.
We just don't want you to get hurt
by feelings he can't... reciprocate.
Look, just because he wears nice clothes...
doesn't mean he's on the down low.
He wore a corset to second period today.
Really? Well, what if I can't? You know,
there's not a lot of guys around here...
knocking down my door for a date.
Or yours, for that matter.
Nobody notices us. Hello? We're in Glee Club.
And I'm tired of being lonely. Aren't you?
But Kurt... Kurt is sweet to me...
and he likes who I am
and I like how I feel when I'm with him.
And he's in our group.
He understands what I'm going through.
Now maybe that's not enough for you guys,
but it's enough for me.
You know what, Sue?
I gotta say I really misjudged you.
Getting the Cheerios to help out
with the Glee Club choreographer fund-raiser...
Well, Erma, I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to make this Glee Club successful.
- Come on!
- Oh. Oh, excited.
Oh, I love a car wash too, you know.
When I was little, if I got all A's,
my dad would let me wash his car...
so I'd get my little toothbrush out,
and I'd clean it all weekend long...
You know, the way you use your mental illness
to help these kids is really inspiring.
I'm shocked you're not married.
Your rims are clean.
We polished them, like, three times already.
Did you bring a change of clothes...
because we're going straight
to the sing-along Sound of Music.
So, listen, Kurt,
this is, like, the third time we've gone out.
- Can't we just make it official?
- Make what official?
You know, that we're dating.
I'm sorry, Mercedes,
but I thought I made it very clear.
I'm in love with someone else.
Rachel?
Yes. For several years now.
¶¶ I bust the windows out your car ¶¶
¶¶ And no, it didn't mend
my broken heart ¶¶
¶¶ I'll probably always have
these ugly scars ¶¶
¶¶ But right now I don't care
about that part ¶¶
¶¶ I bust the windows out your car, hey ¶¶
¶¶ I didn't wanna, but I took my turn ¶¶
¶¶ I'm glad I did it ¶¶
¶¶ 'Cause you had to learn ¶¶
¶¶ I must admit it helped a little bit ¶¶
¶¶ To think of how you felt
when you saw it ¶¶
¶¶ I didn't know that I had
that much strength ¶¶
¶¶ But I'm glad you see
what happens when ¶¶
¶¶ Hah, hah, hah, hah ¶¶
¶¶ I bust the windows out your car ¶¶
¶¶ You know I did it 'cause
I left my mark ¶¶
¶¶ Wrote my initials with a crowbar ¶¶
¶¶ And then I drove off into the dark ¶¶
¶¶ I bust the windows out your car, hey ¶¶
¶¶ You should feel lucky
that that's all I did ¶¶
- ¶¶ After five whole years of this bull ¶¶
- Shh...
¶¶ Gave you all of me
and you played with it ¶¶
¶¶ I bust the windows out your car ¶¶¶¶
You busted my window.
How could you do that? You busted my window!
Well, you busted my heart. Hmm!
Okay. Please examine your personalized menus.
This is what you're gonna be eating
for the next six months.
- Um, mine just says "coffee."
- Mm-hmm.
- What's "smelt"?
- A pungent, low carb freshwater fish.
Okay, let's start with today's business.
Artie, you're cut. You're not trying hard enough.
- At what?
- At walking.
Can't be wheeling you around
during every number.
Throws off the whole dynamic,
and it's depressing.
- So you're kicking him out?
- Mm-hmm.
Also you.
You's gotta go, F.A. Oh, no, no, no. Yeah.
You can't kick people out of Glee Club
because you don't like the way they look.
Uh, why don't you shut your face gash
and stay away from aerosol cans...
because you could
burst into flames at any second.
You three. You're great. You're perfect.
Seriously, don't change a thing.
- Now just hold on a second...
- What? What was that, Frankenteen?
Why don't you, uh,
wipe that dopey look off your face...
and get some lotion for those knuckles
you've been draggin' on the ground?
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me is that you're freakishly tall!
I feel like a woodland creature!
Am I hurting your feelings?
Did I say something wrong?
Because I thought you wanted somebody
who respected you enough to tell you the truth.
But maybe you don't have
the confidence to hear it. Hmm?
Maybe you need somebody
who's going to lie to you...
and tell you things like,
"You got what it takes."
But you know what?
As far as I can see, you don't.
So, why don't you just take a little second,
take a breather...
and ask yourself, "Do I wanna be a winner"...
Screw this. I quit.
- Me t-t-too.
- Let's roll, Artie.
No. Great. Great! Separate the wheat
from the chaff. That's perfect!
Wait.
Barbra Streisand.
When Barbra was a young ingénue,
everyone told her...
in order to be a star,
she'd have to get a nose job.
- Thankfully, she refused.
- Where's this going, Yentl?
Where it's going is that...
we don't need you.
Let's face it. We're never gonna be
as good of dancers as Vocal Adrenaline.
We're gonna win because... we're different.
They told J. Lo her booty was too big.
Curtis Mayfield was more successful
after he became paralyzed.
- Jim Abbott.
- I have no idea who that is.
He was a one-armed pitcher for the Yankees.
Pitched a no-hitter.
Okay, so... Um, misfits and spaz-heads
and cripples can make it too.
That's great. What's your point?
Our point is that...
you're fired.
And I'm taller than you.
Uh... Barely.
Wait. We have to wear mascara?
Sandy says it makes our eyes pop.
Okay.
- Okay.
- There's a lot of moms out there, right?
Just get in the zone, all right?
This is gonna be fun.
Believe me. You're gonna remember this night
for the rest of your lives.
- Mr. Schue?
- I know. You're nervous.
No, that isn't what I wanted to tell you.
It's just... thanks... for believing in me.
Front row, big brown eyes,
cute as a buttermilk biscuit. I barfed.
- He actually showed up? I can't believe it.
- Gentlemen.
Forget every experience
you have ever had in your drab little lives.
This is the most important thing
you will ever do.
Places!
- Ah, ticktock, you don't stop.
- Stop.
- To the ah, ticktock, you don't stop.
- Stop.
To the ah, ticktock, you don't stop.
- To the ah, ticktock...
- I know you're not gonna sing that song.
To the ah, ticktock, you don't stop.
To the ah, ticktock, you don't stop.
- ¶¶ To the ah, ticktock ¶¶

I would like to just go into the recording studio
and lay some of those tracks down.
And of course I would love to play some
bigger venues... Wembley Stadium, Red Rocks.
Hey, guys.
I'm Josh Groban. This is my bodyguard, Flex.
We were in town. I was inducting Run-D.M.C.
into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last night...
- So which one of you is, uh, Sandy?
- Ooh!
Mr. Groban,
we are so honored that you came here today.
- I came here to tell you...
- Yes, sir.
Stop e-mailing me.
This is a restraining order.
Stop sending me nude photos. Stop calling me!
I don't know how you got my number,
how you got my number again after I changed it...
but I don't want any more of
your edible gift baskets or locks of your hair.
And I don't wanna read
any more of those sonnets you wrote for me.
- That stuff got crazy, dude.
- Are we clear?
- Mmm.
- Thank you, gentlemen.
I mean, like...
explosive.
Thanks. Sorry.
I'm sorry, Will.
I... I could have been more supportive.
You guys are actually pretty good.
Honey, you were good.
You were really good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Come here.
Hey, kids. Have you seen Doodle?
Now, you might be thinking, why would a pop star
like me come over here and talk to you?
But let me tell you something. Throngs
of screaming teenagers don't do it for Josh Groban.
No. Josh Groban loves a blowsy alcoholic.
Oh. Wow.
You'll have to forgive me.
I'm a little bit drunk...
and I'm afraid I'm not
making good choices right now.
Maybe she slipped and hit her head again.
You guys kicked some serious tail
up there tonight.
- Sorry about the whole Josh Groban thing.
- No, that's all right.
How are the other guys takin' it?
That Ryerson guy cried himself to sleep
in Figgins's arms...
and Ken Tanaka is raiding the nacho bar.
What about you? You okay?
You know what, Dad? I am.
I mean, this was all
a dream come true, but...
I'm a teacher, and a really good one.
- That's enough for me.
- I know.
I saw the way your students look at you.
You inspire people.
- Inspired me.
- What do you mean?
I'm going to law school.
Night classes for now,
until I get all of my prerequisites.
But I registered yesterday.
You made me realize it's never too late
to grow a pair and go after your dream.
That's amazing. That's so amazing.
Hey, Kurt.
I just wanted to say,
I'm really sorry I did that to your car.
I'll pay for it to get fixed.
It's okay. My dad took my baby away...
after he found my tiara collection
in my hope chest.
And I just wanted to say,
I hope it works out between you and Rachel...
you'll have really cute, loud babies.
Mercedes.
I lied to you.
I-I don't like Rachel.
I'm gay.
Why didn't you just tell me?
Because I've never told anyone before.
You shouldn't be ashamed
of who you are, Kurt.
You should just tell people,
especially the kids in Glee.
The whole point of the club
is about expressing what's really inside you.
Remember?
I can't. I'm just not that confident,
I guess.
Let me get this straight.
The Glee Club got rid of Dakota Stanley...
Mr. Schuester's back...
and they're busy at work on a new number,
more confident than ever.
And down, clap, and up, clap, clap.
This is what we call
a total disaster, ladies.
I'm going to ask you to smell your armpits.
That's the smell of failure...
and it's stinking up my office.
I'm revoking your tanning privileges
for the rest of the semester.
No!
- Miss Sylvester, I wanna thank you.
- For what?
For teaching me a valuable life lesson.
When you really believe in yourself...
you don't have to bring other people down.
Uh, uh, step-ball-change and head.
Low and high.
- Uh. What do you guys think?
- Mr. Schuester?
Yes, Rachel?
It was really good.
Thank you. Okay. From the top!
