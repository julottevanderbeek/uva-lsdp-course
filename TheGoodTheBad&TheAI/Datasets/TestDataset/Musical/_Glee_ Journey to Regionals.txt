't know why anyone would miss
an episode of Glee,
but here's what's been
happening in case you did:
Quinn's parents found out
she's pregnant
so they kicked her out.
I needed my mom.
You move in with me.
and the New Directions and he's
back on Vocal Adrenaline
which freaked everybody out and
convinced them they can't
beat them at Regionals and if they
don't place at Regionals,
the club is over,
which would be awful.
Hey, buddy, see you on Saturday.
Wait. What?
At Regionals. Didn't you hear?
I'm one of the judges.
You cannot allow this to happen!
It's out of my hands, William.
I have no control over what
the Show Choir Governing Board
says or does.
Let me break it down for you, Will.
It's been decided that
this year's Regionals
will be judged by celebrities.
And I'm a celebrity
now, William.
Now I realize my cultural
ascendance only serves
to illuminate your own banality,
but face it.
I'm a legend. It's happened.
Do you have any idea how hard
my kids have been working, Sue?
I have to be honest, Will.
I'm having a really
difficult time hearing
anything you have
to say today because
your hair looks like
a briar patch.
I keep expecting racist
animated Disney characters to pop up
and start singing songs
about living on the bayou.
Principal Figgins, I am begging you.
Do not let her do this to those kids.
William, I resent the implication
that I don't play by the rules.
You leaked our set list at Sectionals, Sue.
I have no memory of that.
I will not let you do this.
We have worked ourselves to
the bone to get where we are.
I'm sorry, Will, but our arrangement stands.
You must win or place at Regionals,
or I'm disbanding the club.
If I were you, I would spend
less time complaining to me and more time
convincing Judge Sylvester
here that your New Directions
have got the goods!
Good luck with that, Will.
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.
Have another wine cooler.
I'm president of the Celibacy Club.
I took a vow.
So did Santana and Brittany, and I did them.
What about Finn?
He's your best friend.
Come on. We're in high school.
You think either one of
us is going to give a damn
about Finn in three years?
Life's just a bunch of
experiences, you know?
You don't get a medal at the
finish line for being good.
You just get dead.
Okay, but you can't tell anybody.
I can't lose my rep.
Our secret, baby.
What about protection?
I got it, trust me.
This isn't just another hookup for me.
Tell me one more time.
You're not fat.
Quinn?
Are you all right?
It's been a long year.
Yeah.
Oh, you need some help with those plates?
I'm not due for a month.
Think I can handle a stack of plates.
Right. I'm...
Yeah.
No one wants any pizza?
All right, well, uh, let's get started.
Thank you for coming to the first
annual New Directions' Regionals'
set list nominations party.
What's the point, Mr. Shue?
Coach Sylvester's one of the judges.
She's gonna crush us.
Artie, you don't know that.
Yes, we do.
She told us at Cheerios practice.
Yeah, she said,
"I'm going to crush Glee Club."
PUCK: A whole freaking year.
All that hard work for nothing.
I'm sorry.
I just really love you guys.
You know how many Facebook friends I had
before I joined Glee Club?
Two. My parents.
Rachel was right.
Being a part of something special--
it made me special.
I just can't
believe it's going to be over in a week.
Wait. Who says it's going to be over?
Please. You think Puck and Santana
are going to even acknowledge
my existence once we're not
in Glee Club together anymore?
She has a point.
Mr. Schuester?
Do you think instead of nominating songs,
we can just... all go around the room
and talk about things that we loved about
Glee Club this year?
WILL: It took everything I had not to
cry.
It's like they've all
walked a thousand miles
just to get punched in the stomach.
What exactly are you
looking for from me here?
Some guidance.
Do you remember when you were going
to quit teaching and become an accountant,
and I showed you that video of
yourself singing at Nationals,
and you said that that was the
happiest moment of your life?
Do you remember why?
Because I loved what I was doing.
And isn't that what you've been drilling
into their heads all year?
That that feeling is way more important
than winning or losing?
I miss you.
I'm seeing someone.
What?
His-his name's Carl.
Carl... Howell.
He's my dentist.
He's always been very impressed
with my oral hygiene,
and the last time I was there,
he was showing me
the machines that they use
to sterilize their tools,
and he asked me out.
We've been going out
every night since then.
You two haven't...?
Sorry. I'm-I'm sorry.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no, that's... No.
It's fine. That's fine.
I just feel like you and
I had our shot, Will.
Thanks for the help.
Um, no, by the way.
We haven't.

Hey! We need to talk.
We had a chance of keeping it together
at Mr. Shue's until you decided to bail.
You're our leader, Rachel.
The way you're on everyone
all the time is annoying, but
it's also what keeps the club motivated.
You and I are going to fix this.
We're going to Regionals,
and we're going to win this thing.
RACHEL: Mr. Schuester, Finn and I
have something we want to say to you.
Me first. Have a seat.
Nine months ago,
there were five of you in here.
And we sucked.
I mean, we really sucked.
Bad.
One day,
all of you are going to be gone.
And all of this, all of us
will be nothing but a hazy memory.
It will take you a second
to remember everyone's name.
Someone will have to remind you
of the songs we sung, the solos
you got or didn't get.
Life only
really has one beginning
and one end, and the rest is just
a whole lot of middle.
And I love you guys too much
to let you not make the most of it.
Now, I was going to quit once,
but you guys brought me back with "
Don't Stop Believing."
It was a nine,
but we are going to make it a ten.
We're doing "Don't Stop" at Regionals?
And then some.
We are doing a Journey medley.
Because who cares what
happens when we get there
when the getting there has been so much fun?
Rachel?
You had something you wanted to say?
Just that we're all really glad
you didn't become an accountant.
Regionals,
here we come!
He's an international musical sensation,
a platinum recording artist 20 times over,
the inimitable Mr. Josh Groban!
She's a four-time Grammy winner
who starred in the highest-grossing
movie musical of all time, Ms.
Olivia Newton-John!
He's a two-time local
Emmy winner and broadcasting icon,
WOHN news anchor Rod Remington!
She is fresh off her fifth consecutive
National Cheerleading Title
and author of the soo
n-to-be-published memoir,
Ohio's home-grown iconoclast,
Coach Sue Sylvester!
And now, our first
performance of the evening,
from Westvale High in
scenic Fort Wayne, Indiana,
Aural Intensity!
: ¶¶  You raise me up... ¶¶
¶¶  You have to believe we are magic... ¶¶
A mash up of Olivia Newto
n-John and Josh Groban.
Are you kidding me?!
Somebody tipped them off about
the judges. Guys, we can't
get distracted by what the
other teams are doing.
We just got to keep our
heads in the game and focus.
Even though we know we can't win?
Yes.
If this is only about winning for you guys,
then I owe you all an apology,
because I've failed you.
And we should just all go home,
because it means we've already lost.
Besides,
we have got something that
the other groups don't.
ARTIE: What?
Finn's dancing.
Right? Come on.
Now let's get out there. We got two minutes.
Aural Intensity's almost finished.
Bring it in. Come on. Come on.
Let's go, go, go, go, go and...
ALL: Whoa!
Break a leg.
I love you.

winner of the Central Ohio Sectional,

Hi. Hi.
Thanks, Rachel.
But we beat you today.
Jessie's a good singer, but
you and I both know he
doesn't have much heart.
Vocal Adrenaline's best days are behind it.
So I have a proposition for you.
Come teach at McKinley.
Excuse me?
You and-and Mr. Schuester
could be co-directors.
We'd be unstoppable.
There's so much that you can teach me.
Oh, Rachel, I can't do this anymore.
I'm tired of coaching glee club.
I want a life.
It took meeting you to realize
all the stuff that I missed out on.
I need some balance, you know?
I need a house and a garden
and a dog, a f...
family.
I missed out on my chance with you,
and it kills me.
And I can't let that happen again.
Where's the rest of your team?
They're, uh... they're at the hospital.
Quinn had her baby. Is she okay?
Yeah, she's fine.
It was, um...
It's a beautiful baby girl.
Newton-John? You're dead to me.
Remington, Horsey,
have a seat and listen up.
I don't care who comes in first,
I don't care who places send, but I have
a very strong opinion
about who comes in third.
Sue, if I may.
That "Bohemian Rhapsody"
had me a-movin' and a-shakin',
and I'm talking old school.
You know, I partied with Freddy
Mercury back in the '70s,
and I partied... hard,
if you know what I mean.
Back then, people weren't
so obsessed with labels.
I, for one, was offended
that only one of the groups
chose to honor me in song.
I think Aural Intensity should win.
Yes.
Two questions. One: Are you single?
And two: How about those New Directions?
I liked them. I thought
they had a lot of... heart.
Heart? Oh, please.
Talk about blatant tokenism.
That whole "We're inspiring, we're a ragtag
bunch of misfits" thing is so 2009.
I couldn't agree more. Let's vote.
The production values simply weren't there.
Couldn't they afford better costumes?
Are they a poor person school?
GROBAN: I thought that
brunette had an amazing voice.
Brunettes have no place
in show business.
Oh, come on. They're just kids.
That's no excuse. By the time I was 14,
I'd already formed a band.
When Josh Groban was their age,
he was already in The Mickey Mouse Club or
something.
As the only educator here, let me point out
that not all kids are afforded
the same opportunities as others.
Is that what you tell yourself
to get to sleep at night?
Some people just simply don't have talent.
You think you're a celebrity. You're not.
You just try hard. That's about it.
Olivia Newton-John has a valid point here.
You have a lot in common
with those kids at your school, Sue.
Underachievers with delusions of grandeur.
Dagnabbit!
Now even I have to admit,
I'm a little confused
as to what Sue is doing in this room.
Wasn't the theme tonight
supposed to be celebrity judges?
Kiss my ass, Josh Groban!
I am a internationall
y-ranked cheerleading coach!
Who lives in Ohio. When this is done
today, Josh and I are flying
back to L.A. first class.
You'll be staying here.
Just like those kids.
I think we've all made up our minds.
Let's vote.
Thank you all for coming.
As you all know, glee club
is such an important...
And I honestly can't even
finish that sentence.
So let's just get to it.
The 2010 Midwest Regional Runners-up
from Fort Wayne, Indiana,
the not-at-all stupidly-named
Aural Intensity!
SUE: Very good.
Mm-hmm.
And now,
your 2010 Midwest Regional
Show Choir Champions
Vocal Adrenaline!
We didn't even place.
Love. She looks like you.
Do you want to keep her?
No.
Do you?
Did you love me?
Yes.
Especially now.
Which one is yours?
What are you doing here?
I see her now.
She looks like you.
Does she have a name?
No.
Beth.
Pretty.
I like that name.
How do you even call yourself a principal?
Okay, this is... this is it. This is not...
Emma?
Emma?! What was that about? It's so unfair.
Will, your kids have
worked so hard for this.
Did you know he's already given
your choir room to the Mock UN?
A deal's a deal. We lost, Emma.
Because Sue cheated!
She cheated, Will, and where do you think
all that money's going? It's going right
into her pockets. We just...
We can't let her win this one!
How can you just stand there
and be so calm about this?
How can you just give up so easily?
I've tried, Emma,
okay? It...
It-It's over.
No. No, it's never over.
I don't care what anybody says.
Some things are worth fighting for.
You mean like the kids? Yes, of course.
Anything else? No.
No. This is about the glee club.
This is not about us.
The hell it is.
I love you, Emma.
There, I finally said it.
And you love me, and dentist or no,
this thing isn't over between us.
RACHEL: Mr. Schuester?
Yeah.
Can you please come to the auditorium?
Sure.
So we have something we need to say to you.
In the beginning of this year,
I was just another football player.
I had a stutter.
I was a closeted diva.
I used to be captain of the Cheerios.
I was afraid to dance outside my room.
I hated everyone in this club.
So did I.
I wasn't honest about who I was.
I was tossing kids into Dumpsters.
I had never kissed a girl before.
And I was getting slushied.
I didn't-I didn't have a father.
Someone I could look up to.
Model myself after.
Someone who could show me what
it really meant to be a man.
We don't care what the judges say.
We won.
Because we had you as a teacher.
MERCEDES: And Glee Club will never end,
Mr. Shue, because...
you are Glee Club.
And you're in all of us now.
¶¶  Those schoolgirl days ¶¶
¶¶  Of telling tales ¶¶
¶¶  And biting nails are gone ¶¶
¶¶  But in my mind ¶¶
¶¶  I know they will ¶¶
¶¶  Still live on and on ¶¶
¶¶  But how do you thank someone ¶¶
¶¶  Who has taken you from
crayons to perfume? ¶¶
¶¶  Oh, it isn't easy ¶¶
¶¶  But I'll try ¶¶
¶¶  If you wanted the sky,
I would write across the sky ¶¶
¶¶  In letters that would soar ¶¶
¶¶  A thousand feet high ¶¶
¶¶  To Sir, with love ¶¶
¶¶  The time has come ¶¶
¶¶  For closing books ¶¶
¶¶  And long last looks must end ¶¶
¶¶  And as I leave ¶¶
¶¶  I know that I am leaving ¶¶
¶¶  My best friend ¶¶
¶¶  A friend who taught me right from wrong ¶¶
¶¶  And weak from strong,
that's a lot to learn ¶¶
¶¶  What can I give you in return? ¶¶
¶¶  Oh, if you wanted the moon ¶¶
¶¶  I would try to make a start ¶¶
¶¶  But I would rather ¶¶
¶¶  You let me give my heart ¶¶
¶¶  To Sir, with love. ¶¶
It's as barren as me in here, Will.
Moving on to greener pastures?
Did you just come to gloat, Sue?
Mostly.
Well... congratulations.
You got what you wanted.
I should shake your hand.
Not unless you got some hand sanitizer.
I've seen that car you drive;
I don't want to catch poor.
Explain something to me.
Maybe we weren't good enough yet
to beat Vocal Adrenaline-- fine.
But we were so much better
than Aural Intensity.
Oh, William, I can't reveal
how the voting went down.
That would betray my sacred
oath as judge or something.
The results simply show
the other clubs to be more deserving.
All I can say is casting my vote was
easy.
It reflected exactly how
I felt in my heart
Well, Sue, congratulations.
You win.
I lose.
The kids lose.
I know you think I'm heartless, Will,
and you may have a point.
I spend large segments of each day
picturing you choking on food.
And I recently contacted
an exotic animal dealer because I had
a very satisfying dream
that the two of us went to a zoo,
and I shoved your face
into one of those pink inflamed monkey butts
that weeps lymph.
And I know that you think I'm a bad person
because I remain unmoved by your
nattering of trite platitudes
to your ill-shapen students
about how the human
condition can be improved
by, yes, singing about it.
And I've proven that I can
wipe you and your Glee Club
off the face of this earth.
But what kind of a world
would that be, Will?
A world where I couldn't
constantly ridicule your hair.
World where I couldn't make
fun of you for tearing up
more than Michael Landon
in a sweeps week's episode
And you know what, Will?
Sue Sylvester's not sure
she wants to live in that kind of world.
So I had a little talk with Figgins.
Glee Club gets another year.
I get what I want.
Do you really not understand
how this sexual blackmail thing works?
Enough, Sue!
I will not be blackmailed by you anymore!
I will tell my wife of our
heated sexual congress
before I will be bullied by you again!
One last chit, Figgy.
Give the glee club another year,
and I won't mention us
making the beast with two backs again.
Huh?
We have another year?
You're a good teacher, Will.
Now, I don't like you so much.
But I admire you
and the work you're doing with your kids.
I really do.
I relish the thought of another full year
of constantly besting you.
You know, Sue, inside...
you're a really good person.
You have a heart.
Okay, let go of my hand.
Hey...
I appreciate what you're
doing for these kids.
I won't forget it.
And I'm seriously going
to puke in your mouth.
We've got another year.
What?
Come on, we got another year!
What?! Oh, my God!
Yeah!
Are you serious?!
: Whoa!
Okay, you guys, I think this is
the perfect opportunity for us
to start rehearsing for
next year's Sectionals
immediately...
Guys, you've all worked
really hard this year,
and you deserve a break. But I have ideas.
Take the summer off.
Have some fun.
Oh, but before you go,
I have something for you.
You all sang for me the other day,
so today I'd like to return the favor.
Puck, if you're ready.

¶¶  Over the rainbow ¶¶
¶¶  Skies are blue ¶¶
¶¶  And the dreams that you dare to dream ¶¶
¶¶  Really do come true... ¶¶
All the adoption papers seem to be in order.
But there's no name on the
birth certificate yet.
It's Beth.
¶¶  Oh, someday I'll wish upon a star ¶¶
¶¶  And wake up where the clouds are far ¶¶
¶¶  Behind me ¶¶
¶¶  Where troubles melt like lemon drops ¶¶
¶¶  High above the chimney tops ¶¶
¶¶  That's where ¶¶
¶¶  You'll find me ¶¶
¶¶  Oh, somewhere ¶¶
¶¶  Over the rainbow ¶¶
¶¶  Bluebirds fly ¶¶
¶¶  Birds fly over the rainbow ¶¶
¶¶  Why then, oh, why can't I? ¶¶
¶¶  I... ¶¶
