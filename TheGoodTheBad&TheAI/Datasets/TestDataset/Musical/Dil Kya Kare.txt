Well, Papa? Have you
forgotten the keys again
Have you found the keys?
What happened?
- Not the car. Stop whistling!
You really scared me.
Are you leaving this evening?
- Yes. Got to earn a living.
To Mumbai. For a day.
l'm building a 5-star hotel there.
- And then?
And then to Bhopal.
- What for?
l've got to address a meeting
of architects there.
And then?
- Two days in Lucknow.
To finalise a site
for the TV-station.
...that's four days.
You're scared of flying. So how
much time will the trains take?
That makes it three days more.
l days?! Don't you know l have
my inter-school contest?!
That's only six days away.
- And so?
Don't wory. l'll wrap up my
work in Lucknow in just a day.
l won't dance if
you don't return...
and then, the showjust
can't be held.
Just watch! l'll be applauding
you from the first row!
Do return soon, Papa!
Look at this, sir.
And look at the layout
ofthe cover-page.
This isn't the picture on it, sir.
It needs a dreamy expression.
We've issued a print order
of 10,OOO copies.
We'll come out with the second
edition once it gains popularity.
Look at the fonts we've used...
isn't it really class?
You couldn't have had a better title
than ''What does the heart do''
The title's okay.
But take my name offthe cover.
l see! Poems by the
anonymous poet?!
lsn't that class?
l've made a design
for the book, sir.
Where've you been, Somu?
l'm so worked up! Anand is away.
And Ram Dulare's taken the day off.
Who'll pick up Neha from school
if l'm delayed?
One moment, Kavita...
- Damn your one moment!
A packet ofturmeric...
the other one.
A packet of red pepper, too.
What picture on the cover, sir?
- Red pepper, of course.
Red pepper and poety!
Somu?! You, too?
Strange man!
A rich man and a poet!
''l kiss those rays
with your lips.._'
''rays that have travelled
the darkness to touch these bars''
''l touch those winds
with your hands.._'
''that blows throug.h my cell
in prison'
WonderFul! Winds in prison!
By the way, what were
you imprisoned for?
How much of sugar in your coffee?
- Don't you know?
Sure, l do. But all that poety
must have leR a bitter taste.
Three and half spoons for him!
Go on, Somu.
''Your ears hear my heart-beat...''
''as if it were a chain
unshackled...''
''or one that separated me
''The shackles forget...
l'm already one with you''
''l'm away from these cells''
''For, l have been released''
May l look for my release now?
- All right. Go ahead.
l can't figure out how a clown like
you can write such nice poety.
l can't either!
You've called so late.
l've been waiting.
How are you?
- First class. What are you doing?
Listening to Somu's
new set of poety.
Really? Let me talk to him.
- Yes, just a moment.
Well, punk? What are you doing
at my place at this hour?
l'm playing watchman.
You have a young and beautiful wife.
l'd be blamed, if she were kidnapped.
So l'm keeping watch.
Keep watch, all right. But what's
all the poety for?
lt's part ofthe new book
l've written.
Really? Recite some for me.
l recite poety over the telephone
only for girls!
What's my daughter doing?
Neha? She's asleep.
- l haven't yet slept, papa!
How can Uncle Somu's poety
ever put someone to sleep?
Where are you today, papa?
- l'm in Bhopal, dear.
When are you returning?
- l'm leaving this place tomorrow.
l'll spend a day in Lucknow
and join you aRer that.
Promise. Go to sleep now.
We can't find a better site than this
for a TV station in Lucknow.
What do you think, Mr Anand?
- Give it a serious thought.
Won't a 300-feet iron tower ruin
the beauty ofthis historical site?
This site falls in the minister's
constituency. He himself chose it.
ln that case, it must never
be built. l refuse permission.
There's another site behind the hill.
That might hide the tower.
Sory, it's time for my train.
lt has to do with the minister.
We might lose ourjobs.
We can go straight to the station
Well, let's go.
You reached safely, l hope?
You didn't take ill, did you?
How's the hotel?
- Evemhing is all right.
Why were you so late in
picking up the phone?
l was in the bath.
- Have you dressed?
Not yet.
- And how are you looking?
You'll get a beating, Anand!
l might spend 3 days more.
- Why? You went there for a day!
There are some changes in the design
and l've called Kailash here.
All right.
Where's Neha?
- She's playing outside. Wait...
What is it, mom?
lt's papa calling.
Don't get me that big
bunny rabbit l asked you for.
Auntie gave it to me just now.
l see. Which auntie is that?
She's a nice lady. She said she'd
get me many more toys.
Come back soon, papa.
Bye. l'm going to teach
Monu some cycling.
Who was it?
- l couldn't see her.
l just saw a car leaving.
Must've been Mrs Malhotra.
She's been distributing toys
ever since she's lost her child.
Tell Neha not to accept toys
Anything else?
- Say ''l love you''.
Don't be scared. l'll help you.
Didn't Mrs Malhotra
give you this, dear?
No.
- Then who did?
l didn't ask her name.
- Was she a friend of mine?
How would l know?
You have so many friends.
Have you seen her earlier?
- You talk so much, don't you?
l've got to teach Monu cycling.
You're late, dear. Where were you?
- l was showing Junmun my doll.
lt's such a cute doll.
It even talks..
l see. Whose is it?
- Mine. Auntie gave it to me.
Which auntie?
- The one who gave me the bunny.
Does she even come to the school?
- Yes. Evey day.
How are you, Mrs Kishore?
Neha says a woman comes
to meet her at school.
You mean Nandita Roy, don't you?
Isn't she your relative?
Nandita Roy? l don't even
know of such a person!
But Neha appears to like her.
- Neha is a kid!
How can you allow her to
meet any stranger?
Let's go, mom. l've got to change
and leave for my dance-classes!
Please don't let Neha meet
anyone without my permission.
Look, dear. You mustn't ever
accept toys from a stranger.
But l know her!
- Do you?
How's she to look at?
- Vey nice.
How does she arrive?
- In a car. She has a big white car.
Does she bring toys for eveyone?
Or is it only for you?
She's my aunt! Why must she
bring toys for the other kids?
What does she talk about?
- Evemhing.
She talks about my friends,
about what my papa does,...
about who helps me with my homework
and Ram Dulare's antics, too.
Want a chocolate, little doll?
What are you cying for?
Stop cying, dear.
- l didn't do any mischief, papa...
and yet, Mom scolded me
and broke my doll.
Mom is terrible! l'm not
going to talk to her!
You're a big girl now...
and you cy! What a shame!
Give your mom the telephone.
l'll scold her, too.
Make sure it's a nice scolding!
Ask her to take me to
my dance classes.
Of course l'll take you, dear.
Go and get ready.
What happened, love?
She sounded vey upset.
Do you know of any Nandita Roy?
l surely must.
If she's young and beautiful.
Do you know her?
Who is she?
- l don't know.
But she keeps meeting Neha,
and buys her expensive toys.
The principal took her for a friend
of mine and allowed them to meet.
Remember the lady who gave Neha
a toy when you were away in Calcutta?
l thought it was Mrs Malhotra.
But it was this woman!
Who could it be?
And why is she aRer my child?
Nothing to wory about, dear.
You're simply over-reacting.
Maybe it's an old friend
who's tying to surprise us.
We'll soon know.
Don't wory.
When are you returning?
- The day aRer.
Deciding on the site
is taking up my time.
What's up?
- My book is out in the market.
l must get the sales started.
- So go ahead.
How can l start the sales
till you buy the first book?
All right. l'll come over tomorrow.
- The book store is nearby.
We can return in 15 minutes.
- But how about Neha?
We'll return before
her class is over.
All right. Ask the watchman
to look aRer Neha.
You write vey well.
This is for you.
We're getting late, Somu.
You can get back for this.
l can't understand
why women chase poets.
You're wrong! My experience
has been quite the opposite!
l've always chased a woman...
but l couldn't get hold of her.
Why don't you find a nice girl
and mary her?
Really? You should have
told me that earlier.
Will you mary me?
- What?!
l'd be grateful to you...
please mary me!
Are you mad?
- No. l'm a poet.
l've even had a book published!
C'mon. Or Neha will be all alone.
l told you we'd be late.
Neha must be so worried.
Where are the kids?
- They've leR.
How about Neha?
- She has leR too.
Her aunt was here to collect her.
ldiot! l told you not to
Iet her go with anyone!
Have you seen a little girl pass by?
- No. We haven't.
He's in Room 405.
Call him out ofthe
conference room!
Relax, Kavita! Have you gone mad?
Here... talk to Anand.
lt's my mistake, Anand...
l've lost Neha!
l'll call the DCP right away.
Yes, immediately!
When's the next flight to Delhi?
- At l in the morning.
Please have a ticket
booked for me.
Alert the airport, the railway
stations and other exits.
There's this 5-year old kid, Neha,
and a woman...
Where could she have taken Neha?
- Nowhere, Neha. Just relax!
l'd die if something
happened to Neha!
We want Neha's pictures
for television.
We'll send copies
at evey station.
Please come with me, Mr Somdutt.
Let's meet Neha's principal.
She can describe the woman.
My child!
Let me go, mom...
My horse'll escape!
Where had you been, dear?
- Nowhere.
Then how did you get home?
- There was this lady in the car.
That nice aunt dropped me!
Where is she?
- She went away.
l tried to stop her and offered
her a cup oftea. She refused.
She said she didn't like tea.
l said that was no problem!
l'll take it.
Are you okay, dear?
One moment, sir.
l'll call your wife.
She has returned.
- Where did you find her?
She was here at home.
That woman dropped her.
l can't understand why she's
doing all this!
Strange... is Neha okay?
- Yes.
Give her the phone.
- Talk to your papa.
How's my little girl?
- l'm absolutely all right!
You mustn't accept giRs or go
away with strangers, my dear.
But l went nowhere! It was mom
who went out with Uncle Somu!
Aunt brought me home aRer
my classes were over.
You should've waited for mom.
- l did.
Even aRer all the kids had leR!
Now listen; you will not go with
Nandita auntie again, okay?
What if she comes with me?
- Well... give your mom the phone.
Neha seems to be all right.
Could l stay here for another day?
l could deal with all my work.
What does this woman want?
Why's she ruining our lives?
How can you say such things, darling?
She can't do a thing, you know.
We have set the cops aRer her.
She'll be exposed soon.
You and Neha mean the world to me.
You mean the world to me, too.
No one can ever break our love.
Not that car, Kavita!
The brakes aren't working!
Listen...!
l'm sory, Mr Anand Kishore.
We couldn't save the baby.
Have you had a nightmare, mom?
- Yes, dear!
Go to sleep, dear.
l can't understand why she brought
Neha home, if she had kidnapped her.
Don't wory.
The principal and Ram Dulare
have given us a description.
We have alerted all the
police stations.
We could even have a guard on duty
to keep a watch on Neha.
Let me go to school, mom!
l'm bored stiff!
Play here today, my dear.
- Whom will l play with?
All my friends have gone to school!
- Don't be stubborn, dear.
Why're you so scared?
Let her go to school.
l'm waiting for Anand to return.
Go on, dear. Playwith Ram Dulare.
Looks like you have no faith
in the police force.
That's not true. It's just
that Anand is not around and...
l understand.
Please don't wory.
Nothing will happen to Neha.
lt's you she went to.
She must be in her room.
But she isn't in her room.
- What are you talking about?!
Stop the Commissioner!
Wait, Mr Commissioner!
My child!
l'm here!
Who are you? Why do you
keep meeting my daughter?
Why do you give her the toys?
Why do you go to her school?
You have made our lives miserable!
Do you want to kidnap her?
Nandita Rai...
isn't that your name?
Who the hell are you?
l'm her mother.
Neha is my daughter.
Your daughter...?!
- Yes.
l have borne the child
you are mother to.
Give it another thought, Kavita.
l don't really need a child.
l can live with your support.
l know. l've drawn strength from
your love to take this decision.
When will she start walking?
She's just a week old.
- My friend's in a hury.
You'd better give the baby the
car-keys. She'll drive us home!
l haven't come to take Neha back.
She belongs to you. And always will.
lt's just that l came to
take a look at her.
l'm sory. l've caused you
a lot of inconvenience.
How am l to believe that you
are indeed Neha's mother?
l have no evidence to prove it.
But... Iook into my eyes!
Don't believe me,
if my eyes seem to be lying.
Why've you been meeting her secretly?
Why didn't you come out in the open?
l was scared that you
might misunderstand me.
l had planned on going back
aRer having met her once.
l don't know what stopped me.
Perhaps it was my feeling of
motherhood, perhaps selfishness.
Or the sense of belonging.
Do not wory. l will go away
as suddenly as l came.
When Neha grows up,...
she might not even remember
having met someone like me.
You mustn't tell her either.
l know, l have caused you a
Iot of harassment.
And believe me, l'd never have
come to your house.
But l'm returning tomorrow.
And l wanted to see Neha
one last time.
l've been so rude to you.
l liked whatever you said.
Neha's lucky to have found
a mother like you.
But she loves her papa more.
He must be better than you then.
- l think so too.
Let's take auntie home.
l'll show her all my toys!
You invite her, dear.
- Some other day, okay?
No! Come with us right now!
We live close-by.
Do come. You leR without even
a cup oftea the other day.
Commissioner! Wait...
Ramu?
- The kid has disappeared!
Where's Neha?
- We've found her.
lt's okay. She was playing
in the park nearby.
There! She was here and l was
Iooking for her all over!
l spilt all the milk running aRer
the commissioner!
l'll fetch some more.
- Get some tea and biscuits too.
How did it all happen?
- You won't believe it.
This is Kittu. A dim doll.
She soils all her clothes!
Papa got this for me.
Her name is Barbara.
How could you believe her?
You don't know these gangsters!
She can never deceive my eyes.
Look at them.
This is a nice doll!
- Like your Papa, eh?
That isn't Papa. Papa's away making
a huge building in Bangalore.
So who's that?
- Somu Uncle!
Now here's your milk... have it.
l'll play donkey for you.
No thank you! l hate milk!
Do you like chocolate then?
- Vey much!
So my little darling will
have chocolate today!
Don't you have a daughter?
- l do. She's just like you.
And where is she?
- Here. In my lap.
But my name is Neha!
- My daughter's name is Neha too.
Really? But why are you cying?
Caught you! My mom cries sometimes
when she's hugging me too.
You're a sweet girl.
- l like you too.
Tea is served, madam.
Anything else?
l'll see you in the evening tomorrow.
It's my day off, you know.
What will you have?
- Black coffee.
l forgot to introduce you to Somu.
- l already know him.
Do you really know me?
- Yes. Neha told me evemhing.
But there's something
l didn't tell you.
l just can't understand
his poety!
Where are you put up, Nandita?
- At the Radisson.
Offer me some!
- Help yourself, dear!
l have a request, Kavita.
- Yes?
My train leaves tomorrow morning.
lf it isn't a problem,
could Neha and l spend...
l won't send her to the hotel.
But you can stay here tonight.
Anand's arriving tomorrow.
You can meet him too.
l'll sleep with you tonight!
You must tell me a stoy!
Why don't you call the hotel.
Somu'll pick up your luggage. And
you can go straight to the station.
Let's play a computer game, auntie!
- Sure.
lsn't it strange?
Neha hardly knows Nandita...
but she's so comfortable
She's her mother, Somu.
The two ofyou have
gone crazy!
She couldn't have known who
has adopted her daughter!
We have vey strict
adoption laws!
l wouldn't know about all that.
Ask her whatever you want to.
l'll be back soon.
- Where are you going?
To the Raddisson.
To pick up Nandita's luggage.
ls she here then?
- Yes. They're waiting for you.
What was Somu talking about?
Why did you allow her to stay here?
Why don't you meet her, Anand?
- Why must l?
How do you know what she wants?
l think she's an impostor!
Where is she?
And where is Neha?
Wash your hands, dim girl!
Hury up!
Help!
Leave her alone!
Rip him apart!
Let me make your plaits!
- No!
Sit down! Or l'll have
your hair cut short!
No way! Auntie says
l have vey nice hair.
Here l am.
Your check-out is over.
Could l now have 20 rupees and
All right. l'll forget the 20 Rupees
for your beautiful smile.
But give me 15 paise!
Watch it, Somu. You need a
chance to start flirting.
Drop Neha at school, will you?
- No! l'll go with Papa!
You must come along too, Auntie!
- She's going to the station, Neha.
When will you come again?
- Some time again.
Good! We'll visit the zoo then!
Papa will now say
''l've forgotten the keys...''
He'll go and give mom a kiss
and return with the keys.
You've forgotten the keys, right?
No, dear.
Neha's a lucky girl.
Anand is a nice person.
What's up, papa?
You're forgetting evemhing!
Know what, Papa? Auntie has
a Neha just like me!
Really? Who else does she have?
- l didn't ask.
Do you like auntie?
- Vey much!
The first edition is sold out.
The second one is now in print.
That's just how lucky l am.
You haven't worked any wonders.
Know what the title
of my new book is?
What is it?
- ''Mother''.
The project papers
have arrived, sir.
Cancel my meeting for this morning.
l'll be late in reaching the office.
Could you find out ifthe train
to Banaras is on time, Anand?
lf it's late, l'm afraid Somu will
drive Nandita crazy with his poety!
Do you have an allergy to poety?
Not at all.
ls the train to Banaras on time?
lt's late by mo hours.
l will recite my new poems then.
- Let her finish her breakfast!
What's up?
- Nothing at all.
Don't lie. You get caught.
You haven't even looked at me
since you've arrived.
Were you taken aback
to see Nandita here?
Strange ironies of life.
l wonder how she feels.
Has she given you her address?
- She doesn't want to.
She said she's happy to see Neha
here and won't come back again.
You're attending the meeting
with Mr Bansal, aren't you, sir?
l told you l'd be late.
Ask them to leave,
ifthey can't wait!
What's wrong?
You're okay, aren't you?
Tired?
You didn't like my allowing
her to stay here, did you?
She's leaving, Anand.
And l wanted you to meet her once.
All right. l'll dress up
and come downstairs.
l could drop her at the station
on my way to the office.
Okay. But don't ask her
awkward questions.
l don't know what she's
is going through.
You stay away for so many days...
don't you ever miss me?
Liar!
That's the number.
Make an enquiy again.
Once the train is delayed, there's
no saying when it'll leave.
ln that case, you'll have to
drop her at the station, Somu.
lt leR at 1 1 .05 a.m.
- Wasn't it late by 2 hours?
No, ma'am. It was right on time.
And it has leR.
lt's delayed by mo more hours.
And perhaps...
- It might even be cancelled!
l suggest you cancel your trip today.
Somu's right. Why don't you
stay back today?
Don't be formal!
You're not leaving today.
l'll show you the city and we'll have
a pam at my place this evening.
That's enough, prince. Won't you
ask Nandita what she wants?
l know the city. But l might as
well buy some books, since l'm here.
Vey well. l'll take you
to the Popular book house.
You'll find my book there!
l'm leaving for the office.
Aren't you forgetting something?
What a coincidence! l gave Kavita
the first copy ofthis edition...
and l'm giRing to you
the last copy!
We have another copy, sir.
For you.
When is your next book arriving?
- Soon.
Have you read ''Dil Kya Kare'' ?
- Sure. Your love-poems are great.
You?
Sory... did l startle you?
- No. l expected to meet you here.
Please sit down.
Without sugar.
- The same for me.
l don't know...
where to begin from.
Forgive me for lying
about the train.
l had so many questions to ask,
when l saw you again.
l wanted to talk to you too.
This kid... Neha...?
- You're right. She's our child.
But you never did...
Didn't you...
No. l didn't get married.
Anand! What are you doing here?
l thought l'd buy your book
and encourage you.
l happened to meet her here.
- Don't fib! You? And books?
lf l didn't know you so well,
l'd have suspected something fishy!
l think something is fishy
Excuse me... will someone ask me
if something is indeed fishy?
Look, sir.
- Show me the original plan.
You have just 4 elevators in such
a huge building. l had planned 6.
The beam width is narrow and you have
altered the site's elevation too.
This won't do.
l had warned you.
Tomorrow's flight is confirmed, sir.
- Flight? Where to?
To Calcutta. You have a meeting
with the Bansal's, sir.
Cancel the meeting.
- But you said it was important.
Fix it up for next week instead.
- Vey well, sir.
ldiot! Why must you call
and not speak?
Could you take the call, please?
l'm waiting for you
at the old fort.
Why have you stopped?
- l'm scared.
But why?
- l don't know.
Are they all here?
- Yes, sir.
''Only fools and asses
work on Sundays''
C'mon, asses. To the boardroom.
At least spare us on Sundays!
Sure l would. Ifyou worked
the rest ofthe days.
l've just been married. At this
rate, my wife will divorce me.
l'll have you married again.
Give Kunal the report.
l've got to complete
the summay.
Complete it now.
l must ship it this evening.
l'm at the market... who else
is coming to Somu's place?
The lab. area ought to be here.
Their fax says it must be over here.
l'm listening.
l'm cooking some veg. fare.
Do you want some non-veg. too?
Let's have something attractive
in such a beautiful building!
Know what? Ask Somu.
And you guys think something
for the wings.
Think ofwhat?
- Who's that?
Ram Dulare here, sir! l'm shopping
for the pam at Mr Somu's!
Do we use a concrete slab here?
- The chickens here are not good.
Let's use stones instead.
- But how will l fy the stones?
This will take all day!
My wife's gonna leave me!
A call from your house, sir.
What dress must l wear
this evening, papa?
This marble at the reception
doesn't go well, Anand.
Wear that pink dress, dear.
Limestone would be a good choice.
- l have 4 pink dresses...
which one do l wear?
Tell me, papa!
Well? Marble or limestone?
- Mutton or chicken, sir?
Tell me what dress
l must wear, papa!
We're wasting so much oftime...
my divorce is a certainty.
Taka ofJapan is waiting for
my report in Bangalore...
and here l am!
Busywith chicken and mutton!
No! l'm not going to eat!
You're right. You're happy as long
as you're single and independent.
Sour grapes, mister. You'll know
when you get married.
May l ask you something if
it's not too personal?
Why didn't you get married?
Well... it was my circumstances
and destiny, l guess.
lt isn't easy for a woman
to live like this.
Didn't you ever ty?
- l did.
But someone's memories always
stopped me from going ahead.
l think you're hiding something.
She must have her constraints.
That's the problem. Constraints
are only for women.
As ifthe man would consider
what Nandita has gone through.
Didn't you ever meet that chap?
- l did.
What did he have to say?
- l didn't ask.
Why not?
He has a beautiful world of his own.
And he's happy too.
And there's no place for you
in that world, right?
lt's the same old stoy.
- Men! They are irresponsible!
The man must perhaps
have blundered...
and never got the opportunity
to make up for it.
He wouldn't, even if he
had the opportunity!
What would you do if a woman
turns up with a 5-year old kid...
and says it's the offspring
ofyour relations?
Will you throw out your wife
and kid, and invite her in?
Maintaining relations is difficult.
Forging them isn't.
But l have nothing against him.
lt all happened in
the spur ofthe moment.
You can't have a baby in the
spur ofthe moment, Nandita.
You're magnanimous. But l could
never forgive such a man.
Okay, don't forgive him.
But what ice-cream will you have?
l'll have dad's share!
- Sure.
You haven't shown Nandita your
collection of paintings, Somu.
l would, ifyou allowed me to.
This is a 200-hundred
year old painting.
Look at the texture...
the smile, the eyes...
The pain l see in her eyes,
l see in your eyes, too.
Do l look 200 years old to you?
l mean... an_ay, what do
you think of my poems?
They're vey good.
Anand is a lucky man.
Let's go out, papa.
l want to see the stars.
Which stars do you want to see?
- Those red, green...
What happened?
- Well, she saw my paintings...
And?
- And read my poety.
And what else?
- And? Well...
l understand!
You can't do anything!
No matter how much l help,
you'll remain an idiot, Somu!
You're being funny!
What do you want me to do?
Grab her hand and
pop the question?
Such a nice girl is
not foryou, Somu.
l've set a record in
missing out on nice girls.
l haven't been joking!
Look how happy Neha is.
Mary Nandita.
You'll be a happy man.
C'mon in, dear!
You'll catch a cold.
Hury up... C'mon!
l'm thinking of returning by
tomorrow morning's train.
Can't you stay for
a few more days?
The more l stay, the more difficult
it will be to go away.
Will going away make
things easier?
You went away without
a word last time.
Do not make haste now.
Have you seen these
new drawings, Anand?
Why? What's wrong?
You must study the
American building.
You're looking at the VCD plant
which is half complete.
My mind was elsewhere.
- l can see that.
An_ay, go through the designs.
The Ambani's are expected at four.
Can't we cancel the meeting?
- Why? What's wrong?
Nothing much...
Send Nandita in...
- Nandita?
No, Neha... not me!
l'll tell you a stoy!
l can hear you, Neha!
But l wasn't even playing with you.
- But you've been caught!
You folks are still playing here!
Aren't we going to the pam?
What pam?
- Have you forgotten?
lt's the annual bash at
the Jodhpur palace.
Which dress do l wear, uncle?
You can't go there, dear.
It's only for grown-ups.
Such spoil-sports! Why don't
they call kids too?
Go ahead, all ofyou.
l'll stay back with Neha.
Yes! We'll play carrom-board!
- All right. l won't go either.
Why not?
- It's a party for couples.
Go ahead with Kavita.
l'll stay back for a game of carrom.
Take Kavita with you...
l have a headache.
So why didn't you tell me?
Oh God! No one will go
to the pam now!
Don't do that, please...
All right. l'm game. Let's see
what parties you have here.
Welcome... you're late!
This won't do!
Join them all!
Well? You were certainly
in the mood to dance today!
Remember when you first
danced like that?
ln Bangkok. When we were
on our honeymoon.
Nandita dances well.
l was only accompanying her.
She can't be better than me.
- Really?
What are you up to? l have
my karate classes in the morning!
Tired?
That's what comes out of
dancing with mo girls.
Nandita is a nice girl.
Somu's interested in her...
what do you think?
l could talk to her.
lt's vey cold, isn't it?
Why do you keep
running away from me?
l haven't forgiven myself
for what happened that night.
l must've been out of my senses
l felt so guilty. l had
protected you. And yet...
Please don't say such things.
l'm equally responsible
for what happened.
Whenever l have passed the
station of Mogulsarai...
l've looked for you in the
crowds on the platForm.
Why did you go away without
saying anything?
Had l known this is what
would have happened...
l'd never have leR
without talking to you.
l felt that night as if
l had lived many lives.
l'm still not sure whether
that was a dream... or for real.
l felt like waking you up
and talking to you.
But l was afraid, it would
shatter my dream.
l got offthe train at the station
with your memories in my heart.
l was going back home
aRer a year.
My father was vey happy. l had
stood first in the University.
We had a flourishing business
in Banarasi zari.
My daughter is one in a million!
l've been both father
and mother to her.
Fortunate will be the one
who marries her.
There's no hitch in the horoscopes.
- Rahul is returning from London.
So let's fix a date
for the wedding.
The Panchami is an auspicious date.
l felt the ground
slip under my feet.
l felt like leaving evemhing
and go looking for you.
But l couldn't muster
the courage.
But l was also afraid
ofwhat l'd say to you...
what ifyou had not
believed me?
How have l lacked in bringing
you up that you are punishing me?
Tell me! Who is responsible
for this sin?
l'll fall at his feet and
ask him to mary you! So tell me!
l don't know. l really don't!
l can't face anyone anymore.
When you don't even know him,
why give birth to the baby?
You have a long life ahead.
So let bygones be bygones!
Think ofyour future.
l can't give you the permission
for an abortion.
Nobody would take the risk
aRer all the tests we've done.
l can't give birth to
this baby, doctor...
Only God can prevent its birth.
l can do nothing.
We have only one way now.
lt was a strange predicament.
With Neha in my womb...
l kept thinking ofyou.
Evey moment.
Where were you? Why weren't
l don't know why,
but l always thought...
that you'd suddenly turn up
Now, dear... be brave.
lt's a baby-girl.
- Let me see...
How's she to look at?
- No!
She had promised not to
Iook at the baby!
The car is waiting for you.
Come straight to Banaras from Delhi.
l couldn't even see
the baby l had borne.
My father tried to get me
married again.
My alliance was even fixed with
a father ofmo in America.
But l couldn't bring myself
about to agree to it.
l joined a University in Australia
and spent 5 years there.
l returned when l suddenly
got word of my father's death.
My aunt gave me the address of
the orphanage she had leR Neha in.
l had a tough time winning over
the clerk at the orphanage...
and it was she who gave me
your address.
You bore it all alone...?
l was never alone.
You have always been with me.
And look at the games
God plays.
l was separated from Neha...
but she found you.
You have gone through a lot.
l have given you nothing.
What can l even ask for?
l can return peacefully now.
l want to tell Kavita evemhing.
- Please don't do that.
No one can understand
our relationship.
No woman can ever share
her husband.
l don't want to hurt Kavita.
She's a good mother and a wife.
But l... l've been able to
do nothing for you.
But this can't continue...
you must get your due.
What the hell is going on here?
l'll explain evemhing...
- Explain what?!
What were you doing
with that woman?!
Hear me out, Kavita... please.
You can't even imagine what
sorrows Nandita has faced.
So you were wiping her tears
with her in your arms, eh?
l was doing nothing ofthe sort.
Why don't you...
l was a fool not to have
noticed it all these days!
''She's a great dancer indeed''
And there you were with her,
before the world...!
l'll deal with you later!
l'll first throw that woman out!
Nandita will certainly leave...
but not like this.
How else then?
With due respect.
- Only because she's Neha's mother?
And also because...
l'm Neha's real father.
You've been having an affair
with this woman for six years!
Believe me, Kavita...
we never even met.
l've had enough!
l can't take this anymore!
How dare you come
into my bedroom?
l've had a nightmare, mom...
May l sleep with you?
Please let me, mom...
l'm terribly scared!
l've had a nightmare, mom...
May l sleep with you?
Not anymore! She won't go away...
So l'm walking out!
What are you doing, Kavita?
Please ty to understand!
lt was a mistake l made!
Please listen to me...
Anand? What's up?
Let's go, Somu...
- What's all this about?!
Wait, Kavita...
At least listen to me!
What happened?
What a betrayal!
l was a fool to believe
him all these years!
What haven't l done for him?
And what did l get?
Get a hold on yourself...
- Why, oh why?!
Was it only because l
couldn't give him a child?!
What a conspiracy
they hatched, Somu!
They had a rollicking time
for six years...
had a baby and sent it away
to the orphanage!
And l, like an idiot,
had faith in him!
l gave up evemhing for him!
And he snatched evemhing
away from me!
l've loved Neha more than a
mother would. He snatched her too!
He was romancing with that woman,
right under my nose!
And l... it's all my mistake!
But l won't make this mistake again!
l'll leave that man!
l'll never return to that house!
Let him live with that bitch!
Anand? Right now she is...
Give her the phone. Please.
At least talk to him.
- My lawyer will talk to him!
What more can l do for you?!
- l'm your culprit...
l've made a mistake.
Punish me as you will...
Cut out the dramatics.
You've fooled me enough!
You're vey angy.
But think of Neha.
She can't live without you.
So you want me to play
the maid in that house?!
What are you talking about?
- l don't want to talk to you!
Do you want to leave?
Staying here hasn't
helped matters.
Don't take offense
at what Kavita said.
ln her shoes, perhaps
l'd also have...
Call her back soon.
What are you talking about?
Are you sure he's the same man?
How can l ever forget him?
And how about Neha?
How's she to look at?
She's vey sweet.
l remember. She had eyes
just like yours.
Evemhing else
is like Anand's.
l've found happiness of a lifetime
in these few days, auntie.
When l wanted to leave
this morning... my feet froze.
l didn't have
the courage to awaken her.
l longed to embrace her
and kiss her one last time.
But what could l have told her?
So l just had an eye-full
and leR.
Didn't Anand ty to stop you?
Had he nothing to say?
What would he say?
l can't bear to see his grief.
How about your own sorrows?
- What sorrows?
l've found evemhing.
A sweet little daughter...
an angel-like man...
They are vey happy.
Whom are you tying to fool?
What did you get in the end?
Now that you are there...
don't give up evemhing.
You won't get this
opportunity again.
Neither will you get your
daughter... nor your man.
How can you say such things, aunt?
l've caused strife in
their happy family.
What ifthat woman doesn't return?
And what if she doesn't
Iove Neha anymore?
Our child will be orphaned.
How will Anand manage on his own?
l'm returning by this
evening's train.
lt's all my mistake.
Hadn't l given in to your father...
Neha would have been
with you today.
l have sinned!
Do not curse yourself, aunt...
perhaps it's all in my destiny.
l wish l could see Neha once.
Get Mummy!
Do you want anything, sir?
- Nothing.
l'll help Neha dress up today.
- And who'll help you?
l'll dress up on my own.
l see... but do you even know
where your socks are?
l know evemhing.
What is this?
- Your uniform.
What day is it today?
- Tuesday.
lt's a day for my
physical training!
Want any help, sir?
Help the kid dress up...
l'll prepare the breakfast.
l like my milk cold, Papa!
Don'tjust stand around there!
Help me out!
Problem, sir... you've worn
mo different socks.
Take my advise. Call Mummy!
You don't know a thing!
Yes, call madam back.
Whistle with me!
Mom fought with you, didn't she?
- Not at all.
Don't lie, Papa!
You always get caught!
Okay... she was vey angy.
Didn't you say ''sory'' ?
She went away before
l could say that, dear.
But why was she angy?
- You won't understand, dear.
Of course l will, Papa.
Ty explaining.
Mummy got to know that
Nandita auntie is your mummy.
Auntie? My mummy?
Isn't mummy my mummy then?
Mummy's your second mummy.
- And auntie's my first mummy?
So why has auntie leR?
- l don't know, dear.
She will come back,
won't she?
Call for you, madam.
l have nothing to
discuss with you!
Listen...
Chhotu! Hury up and
get me a cup oftea!
We have sunshine aRer ages today.
So let's go out somewhere.
l just came over to
your place like this.
l don't want to be a burden or
inconvenience you in any way...
Have you had your say?
Or is there anything else?
l want a promise from you, lady.
You will have faith in me and
ty to be vey happy, okay?
l have always been waiting
for you to need me...
so l could make you happy.
l want another promise.
You will not cy anymore.
Come to think of it, those tears
in your eyes do make them beautiful.
All that pain...
There goes the poet
in me again!
But l can't help it.
That's how you are.
l'm going to my press for a while.
We'll go out aRer that. Okay?
This is Ram Dulare Sinha!
There's no one here!
How are you, Ram Dulare?
Madam! l have a problem!
And a confusion!
Boss has taken over evemhing
since you've leR.
He doesn't let me help at all!
- What does that mean?
He dresses up Neha on his own.
He prepares the breakfast...
and makes me stand
outside the kitchen!
Why? Doesn't Nandita help?
She has leR!
- LeR?
With bag and baggage!
l brought her the cab!
Don't tell you boss l had called.
Could l tell Neha at least?
- l'll talk to her myself.
Rubbish! How could anyone
have mo mummies?
My father never lies!
He said my first mummy
is actually my second...
and my second mother
is actually my first!
Because he didn't find my
first mummy first...
he met my second mummy.
So she's my first mummy!
Understand?
- No.
Stupid!
l haven't even got the drawings.
How'll l prepare the estimates?
C'mon, Balsara.
You have all the details here.
l'm leaving.
l hope you're returning. We must
send the estimates this evening.
l'm on duty with my daughter
aRer 4 p.m.
Hury up, Somu... it's time
for Neha's school break.
l can't say ifAnand
will remember.
Neha might wait at the school.
So let's hury.
My train is late by 3 hours.
l thought l'd bid Neha good-bye.
l leR when she was
asleep this morning.
You did a good thing by coming.
- l hope you don't mind?
Don't say such things.
She's your daughter.
You may meet her any time you wish.
- And you?
ls she your second mummy?
- God! She's my first mummy!
My second mummy's away
at Uncle Somu's!
Have you told Neha evemhing?
l hide a truth...
and my wife leR me!
l don't want to hide another truth
and lose my daughter, too.
Where were you, auntie mummy?
- l was around, dear...
So let's go home!
- It's time for her train, dear.
But you had promised
that we'd visit the zoo!
Actually, l...
l'll take you there.
Where's she going away,
Ieaving me behind?
You mustn't be obstinate, Neha.
- You mustn't break a promise.
Stay back, ifyou can.
You may leave tomorrow.
What Anand is doing isn't right.
l'll have a word with him.
That isn't necessay.
l'm only tying to help...
- l've told you.
l don't want any pity.
Sory. l was held up.
- Yes. You're busy nowadays.
Well? What is it?
How's Kavita?
l can't even talk to her...
she doesn't take my calls!
Maybe she doesn't want to
talk to you at all.
Please make her see reason.
Neha's missing her vey much.
Why don't you send Neha to her?
- And how will l live?
Why not? You have...
- What do you mean?
How many pies will you
have your fingers in?
Now don't you talk like
this about Nandita...
The whole world is talking
about the two ofyou.
She's young and beautiful.
She has borne you a daughter.
Okay. l'll talk to Kavita.
But l don't think that will help.
l'm sory. Kavita must be
waiting for me.
You take ages to pick up
the phone, mom!
Sory, dear.
l was in the garden.
Why aren't you coming home?
- It's just that...
Are you still angy with Papa?
Hasn't he said sory to you?
Didn't you go to school today?
- l did.
But Papa made me wear
the wrong dress again.
Who brought you back from school?
- Ramu did.
Know what, mummy?
We had been to the zoo.
We had a nice time!
We had rides and ice-creams.
Papa says Nandita auntie
is my first mummy.
But l'm your daughter...
isn't that right?
Yes. You're my daughter.
So why don't you come to me?
- l will, dear. l sure will.
l'll come over with Ramu,
ifyou don't.
Don't do that... l'll come over.
We'll go to zoo again
and have lots of fun.
Sure.
Come soon, mom...
- Of course, dear.
Don't wory, Mr Somdutt.
l'm a divorce-specialist.
This is my hundredth case.
l've had ninety nine couples
split already.
This is how you must
appear in court.
One look at you and the judge
will issue a decree in your favour.
Court? l don't understand.
- This is a lawyer. Mr Meghani.
He has all the documents ready.
- What papers?
We have pressed charges of mental
torture, infidelity and...
illicit relations with a woman.
You'll get a divorce immediately.
A divorce?
- Of course!
l'll make life miserable
for Mr Anand!
He has filed a claim for
Neha's custody on your behalf.
She'll now live with you.
- Now wait a moment...
What's going on, Somu?
How can l decide like this?
Well! We seem to be
keener than she is!
You saw it all yesterday, Kavita!
You spoke of leaving Anand!
- l did.
But l need some time
to think it over.
What will you think about?
Do you expect Anand to call
you back as his wife again?
Where is your self-respect?
How much more will you bear?!
Leave the papers here,
Mr Meghani.
Did Mummy say sory to you?
- No.
Did you call her?
Or talk to her?
How will l talk to her, dear?
She doesn't take my calls.
l'll make her talk to you!
This is Miss Neha Kishore here!
Why don't you come home?
- Ask your papa that question.
Will you return if Papa
says sory to you?
He won't say that, dear.
- Of course, he will.
Talk to her, dad.
Don't refuse him, mummy!
Speak up, papa!
l have nothing to talk
to you about.
Did she hang up?
She's getting to be terrible!
- No. l'm the one who's terrible.
l'll personally go and
apologise to her.
ls madam Kavita in?
- Yes. One moment.
What is this?
- Just what you see.
Who gave Kavita the idea?
Kavita is no kid, Anand.
She can think for herself.
And she's right too.
How much will she tolerate you?
So it was your advise. l wish
l knew what a friend you are.
You should've been tending
to her wounds...
and you were instead
rubbing salt on them.
l couldn't imagine
you'd fall so much!
Who are you calling a fallen man?
You're the one who has stooped!
No matter what happens bemeen
Kavita and me. You will..
My wife... remember that!
- What wife?!
Have you leR me worthy
of being called that?
l've made a mistake, all right!
So what do l do?
Kill myself? Hang to death?!
ls this the punishment
you will give me?
Will putting your signature
on this give you any peace?
You have found peace in what
you have done, haven't you?
You have a lover, a wife,
a kid... evemhing!
What are you talking about?!
- Skip the drama, Anand Kishore!
ARer what you've done to Kavita,
what did you expect?
A bouquet from her?
With a thank-you note?
lt's all your doing.
You have instigated her!
You could never stomach the fact
that she had leR you for me.
And now that you have
the opportunity...
But remember... Kavita is my wife.
And l'll never give her a divorce!
l'll see what you're going to do.
- Somu will do nothing.
lt's l who will do it!
She wants a divorce... as if
marriage were a child's play!
We have taken the
sacred vows together...
and what is more,
we have loved each other.
Does one mistake render
evemhing to dust?
We have built this relationship
bit by evey bit!
We have lived for each other
Will all that be overjust...
How can she think or even
talk of living without me?!
l will never leave her... She
hasn't sacrificed any less for me.
She gave up her dreams,
her aspirations and her father too!
Will all these sacrifices be
finished forjust one mistake?
You won't understand, Nandita.
When you have someone
to love you...
it changes the meaning
ofyour life.
One always looks for ways
to keep the other happy.
l'd find myself all alone
without Kavita.
My life would be meaningless.
Whom would l live for?
And she too...
it can't happen!
C'mon, Kavita.
You're late. It's time
for the hearing.
C'mon.
Just a minute, Kavita.
What are you up to, Kavita?
Please don't do this!
Let go of my hand, Anand.
- Please hear me out!
Say evemhing to the judge.
C'mon, Kavita.
Please don't disturb my client.
Or else...
l want your signatures
on this.
What is it?
l am your layer Please sign it.
Do you want a divorce
Your lawyer claims that Mr Anand
Kishore has betrayed you...
he has tortured you and has
inflicted atrocities on you.
He had illicit relations
with another woman.
That he brought one
Mrs Nandita Rai home...
and threw you out in
the middle ofthe night.
That's a lie, Your Honour.
Let's not...
One moment, Mr Anand.
l'll record your statement later.
Please ask her to talk to me,
Your Honour.
lf not for me, she must at least
think of our daughter!
Daughter? In whose custody is she?
She's in Mr Anand's custody.
He has forcibly taken possession
We have filed a claim
for her custody.
That's a lie, Your Honour.
Mrs Kavita herselfwalked out
on her daughter...
l beg ofyou, sir...
Please stop it!
The next hearing will be
on the 15th of October.
Come to my chamber, Mr Somdutt.
l'll have the affidavit ready.
Did you see all the dim
linen being washed in public..
when we take family matters
to the courts?
We still have time.
Have faith in me. Let's go home.
We have a world of our own...
with you, me and Neha.
There can be no one else!
Are you sure there won't
be anyone else?
No one.
- So why is she here?
Why are you here Miss Nandita Rai?
Or shall l say Mrs Nandita Kishore?
l know l have hurt you, Kavita.
But believe me. Before l came
to your house...
l didn't know it was
Anand's house too.
You bore his child! And you didn't
even know where he stayed!
l'm speaking the truth.
l didn't even know his name.
Don't you know what
we call women...
who don't even their children's
father's name?
Please don't say that! Neha is
as much your child as she is mine.
Please trust me...
- Trust?! What trust?
Do you even know
what that means?
lt was out oftrust that
l gave you place in my house.
lt was out oftrust that l
shared Neha's love with you.
But you have always
betrayed my trust!
l am homeless because ofyou.
l've lost my husband and my child!
And l must trust you?!
Believe me, l did
nothing deliberately.
Maybe l have lost your trust.
But l come in the hope that...
since you are a woman and a
mother, you will forgive me.
l will not lie.
l was over-whelmed to
see Neha in your house.
l was happy that she had
found a better mother than me.
l wanted to go away.
But l couldn't control myself
when l found Anand there.
l didn't ever want to
break your home.
But when you walked out,
...l started getting hopes.
l thought this was perhaps
God's way ofjustice...
You've had your share ofjoy.
And it was my turn now.
But nothing ever belonged to me.
Anand could have done anything to me,
aRer you had leR.
Anything!
And l'd have happily consented.
But no... he respected me for
being the mother of his child.
That is all.
You might call our physical
relationship a sin...
but you can't imagine what
an ordeal we had gone through.
Swinging bemeen life and death...
we did stagger that moment.
Anand loves only you, Kavita.
There's nothing lacking in his love.
He loves only you.
More than anything else in the world.
More than himself.
That's the truth.
And nobody knows it better than me.
When you know so much,
why are you staying in my house?
Why don't you go away?
- l will.
l came here to go away.
But there's something
l must ask for.
Give it to me in charity.
- Now what do you want?
What?!
Give me Neha.
l'll live on her support!
Have you gone mad?!
- What are you saying, Nandita?
We can't even think of parting
with our daughter...
Please, Anand! You have Kavita
and evemhing else in life!
But in Neha, l will find
a daughter and you too!
l'll have found a reason to live!
Believe me, l will love her
more than my life!
l will always hold her
close to my heart...!
Please give Neha to me...
l promise never to
show you my face again!
Why don't you answer her, Anand!
Kavita is mine!
l'll never part with her!
Don't say that, Kavita.
You have Anand.
You can have all the
happiness in your life!
But l have nothing...
l'm all alone!
l'm vey lonely...!
No, Anand! You can't do this!
l beg ofyou!
My love... l'm here for you.
- l want Neha too.
Do you trust me?
- l can't live without Neha.
And l can't live with you.
You mean the world to me...
We are, because you are.
No! l've lost her once...
l won't lose my child again!
How can l give my daughter away?
How will l live without her?
We will live with
each other's support.
Let her take Neha away.
- No, Anand!
No, Nandita! Please!
Don't let her take Neha away!
Go on, Nandita. Take her away.
- No!
No! You have no right
to give Neha away!
Go away! For God's sake!
No! Leave me alone...
l can't give my Neha away!
Anand, l...
- Stop her, Anand! Please!
Mr Anand had called.
You can take Neha away.
l can't live without Neha...
No... how will l live
in this house without her?
Do you know, mom?
Today's my real birthday!
What?
- Auntie mummy told me!
Let's go in.
Where is your auntie mummy, dear?
- It was time for her train.
She has leR. But she has leR
word for you in this tape.
Have you seen my
birthday cake, papa?
''Anand once complained that
l had leR without a word''
''So l want to have my say
this time, before l leave''
''l seek forgiveness from you,
to begin with''
''l have hurt you vey much.
Please forgive me''
''lt's a welcome co-incidence.
It's Neha's real birthday...''
''and l'm leaving behind my
father's and my estate for her''
''Evemhing belongs to her.
She must have it all''
''l understand the anguish of a mother
whose child is snatched from her''
''And no mother can cause
this agony to another mother''
''l must have borne her.
But she is your daughter''
''She asked for you,
the moment l met her''
''Anand had returned
my child to me''
''And l am returning
your Neha to you''
''l was blinded by selfishness.
l wanted my daughter back''
''l forgot, l had decreed
the orphanage for her''
''lt's you and Anand who have
given her a real life''
''l must apologise to Anand
before l leave, too''
''Rarely do you find a father,
a husband, a human-being like him''
''The one unexpected moment of love
l got from him, is enough for me''
''l now have yours and
Neha's memories linked with them''
''So l'm not alone anymore''
''l'm going away forever...''
''but you will forever
remain with me''
ls that the Banaras express?
lts about to leave
