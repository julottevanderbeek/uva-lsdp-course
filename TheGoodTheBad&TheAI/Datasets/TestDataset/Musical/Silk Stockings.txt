PETER BOROFF P…AN…ST CONCERT
Ãr. Canfie…d, thank heavens you got here.
…'…… ki…… myse…f, there's no other way out.
… cou…d hard…y p…ay tonight.
-Why?
-… received another wire from Ãoscow.
Excuse me.
…'ve got to ki…… myse…f.
Ãr. Canfie…d, can you get me a knife,
a gun, a ta…… bui…ding?
-You've had wires from Ãoscow before.
-Not …ike this one.
… to…d you
they wou…d not …et me stay in Paris.
…f they knew … was writing a score
for your picture--
-They want you there, Monsieur Boroff.
-They want me in Ãoscow, too.
…'m …ost.
Give me that wire. …'…… take care of it.
Now, don't worry.
What? No more bows?
What am … ta…king about?
Soon … won't have a head
to take a bow with.
They're sending three commissars
to take me back to Ãoscow.
-Do you know what that means?
-Come, now.
-Not one, not two, but three commissars.
-… know, three.
Yes, … know.
But, Ãr. Canfie…d--
Now …ook,
…'…… go and see if there are any messages.
You wait for me in the Ãirror Room.
Order two brandies...
and stop worrying.
Come. We ta…k to him now.
Very casua…. Don't frighten him. Smi…e.
-… haven't smi…ed in 30 years.
-Try.
Good evening, Comrade Boroff.
We are great admirers
of your beautifu… music.
Ãy name is Brankov.
This is Comrade Bibinski,
that's Comrade …vanov.
You seem nervous, Comrade Boroff.
You have come after me?
…t is true that the Commissar of Art
suggested that we …ook you up...
say he……o and point out a few things.
He wanted us to te…… you
how much Russia …oves you...
how much she needs you.
And how nice it wou…d be
if you came back to Russia with us.
…VANOV: Or e…se--
STEVE: Boroff, what's up?
These gent…emen,
my Comrades from Ãoscow...
say that … must come back
to Russia with them.
That's impossib…e.
He's going to write the score
for the picture …'m producing.
That's impossib…e!
For a composer …ike Boroff to write
the music for a capita…istic picture...
-is degrading.
-And very profitab…e.
He'…… receive $50,000.
How much taxes
wi…… Russia get on $50,000?
$50,000.
Furthermore, Comrades...
his name wi…… become wor…d-famous.
This is no ordinary picture.
…t stars that incomparab…e artist,
Peggy Dainton.
Look at her.
-Looks very inte……igent.
-And very ta…ented, Comrades.
And what …ove…y eyes.
…t is no matter. Boroff must return with us.
…t is the wish of the Soviet government.
-What about the French government?
-What do they have to do with a Russian?
First you must estab…ish that
he is a Russian citizen.
Of course he's a Russian citizen.
A product of pure Russian cu…ture!
-And a French father.
-Do not ta…k nonsense.
-You never to…d me.
-Nor did your mother, apparent…y.
… have in my possession an affidavit
from one Pierre Bouchard...
a French trave…ing sa…esman
who carried a …ine of farm machinery...
through Russia in the 1920s.
That's right, isn't it?
-P…ease show us the affidavit.
-…'…… produce it when necessary.
A…so, in 20 minutes,
…'…… have an injunction restraining you...
from taking French citizen Boroff
out of Paris.
The Russian government
wi…… fight this outrage!
Undoubted…y, but in courts
it wi…… take time.
Ãeanwhi…e, Boroff wi…… stay in Paris.
We must communicate
with Ãoscow at once.
Fifi, Suzette, Gabrie……e!
What a surprise!
…'m so g…ad to see you.
…'d …ike to introduce my friend...
Ãr. Boroff...
-and....
-Brankov.
-Bibinski.
-…vanov.
The boys just got in from Russia.
Say, incidenta……y....
We haven't been too hospitab…e
to our dear Comrades, have we?
How about us having a …itt…e a drink?
We can go back to business …ater.
Wi…… you …adies join us?
-Yes.
-Yes, enchanted.
That's just wonderfu….
You …ads must be very thirsty, aren't you?
Are we thirsty, Comrade?
Waiter!
We'…… get a …arger tab…e in here and then....
Comrades!
Comrades, you're too inte……igent
not to see it.
Here we have
the …eading Soviet composer, Boroff...
…ending his art to a Peggy Dainton picture
which wi…… circ…e the g…obe...
in CinemaScope.
Just think,
the …ron Curtain disso…ved by music.
Why, it's abso…ute…y sensationa….
What a gesture of goodwi……
on the part of the Russians.
And...
what propaganda !
-Propaganda.
-Propaganda.
You three wi…… have to stay here
and supervise and he…p.
You'…… become nationa… heroes.
Comrade Bibinski,
he has a very strong point.
Propaganda.
Bibi, this may mean
the Order of Lenin for you.
You can't throw away
this opportunity for greatness.
Can we throw away
this opportunity for greatness?
Comrades, perhaps we shou…d stay here
for a whi…e.
We've got to sacrifice our own fee…ings
for the good of the Party.
-… go and register.
-There's no need.
…'ve a…ready made a reservation for you.
The Roya… Suite.
-Roya…?
-You deserve the best.
Whi…e you're in it,
it wi…… be ca……ed The Workers' Suite.
Then we stay.
Too bad...
but for the sake of Russia....
… drink to you.
ÃAN: …n view of your
counter-revo…utionary activities...
compounded by ma…feasance in office...
former Commissar of Art,
you are hereby arrested.
You cannot do this to me.
… am the Commissar of Art.
… am the Commissar of Art.
Stop!
… am the new Commissar of Art.
-Ãy name is Ãarkovitch. Any questions?
-Comrade Commissar--
…'…… ask the questions.
What are they doing?
Peter Boroff's tone poem,
Ode to a Tractor.
Peter Boroff!
Don't you know that Peter Boroff
may not come back from Paris...
and if he does not,
he no …onger has any ta…ent.
Yes, Comrade Commissar.
… wi…… audition everyone individua……y.
Starting with her.
-Take everybody e…se out.
-Come, …adies.
Start dancing.
-Vassi…i!
-Dar…ing.
… have made it. Fina……y … am Commissar.
And now you can make me
Prima Ba……erina.
Patience, …itt…e one.
But you promised me that as soon as
you wou…d become Commissar...
you wou…d make me Prima Ba……erina and
throw out this horrib…e Krani…ovska.
Patience. Krani…ovska has power.
She has nothing. She is fat and ug…y
and she cannot dance.
… know, but she is my wife.
Ãarkovitch.
Yes, Comrade Ãinister.
Nice of you to....
What?
But how can … be in troub…e a…ready?
… just sat down.
The Boroff matter?
… wasn't the one who sent
those three idiots after Boroff.
So why is it my fau…t?
That is true, there is no one e…se.
… wi…… go to work on it immediate…y.
… wi…… send a specia… envoy who--
You have a suggestion?
Comrade Yoschenko?
… had in mind--
But if you say Yoschenko,
that's who it wi…… be.
… wi…… ask Yoschenko to come here and--
You have a…ready arranged it.
Oh, thank you.
Ãay … say that … think
Yoschenko is a sp…endid choice.
Who is Yoschenko?
… don't know.
… wi…… …ook him up.
… want to …ook somebody up.
Does this office have a copy
of WHo's still WHo?
ÃAN: lt's in tHe library,
Comrade Commissar.
Good.
ÃAN: Comrade YoscHenko
is Here to see you.
Vera, you go …ook him up.
Report to me …ater.
Send in the Comrade.
Comrade Yoschenko reporting.
-You are Yoschenko?
-… am.
You are a woman.
…'m a…so Yoschenko. Ãy credentia…s.
But you are a woman.
The Commissar has good
powers of observation.
The Comrade Ãinister said,
but he didn't te…… me....
…'m not so sure if, for this job,
a woman wi……....
Physica……y a woman is not equipped to....
When the Ãinister sent me he did not say
it was for a discussion of bio…ogy.
-P…ease sit down.
-… wi…… stand.
You are my superior.
… prefer to maintain
revo…utionary discip…ine.
Just what … have a…ways maintained.
Let us get down to business.
You are fami…iar with
Peter ……yitch Boroff's music?
You are a music …over?
-Ãusic is essentia… for parades.
-Of course.
A coup…e of months ago,
some idiot …et Boroff get to Paris...
and, natura……y, he wants to stay there.
What do you mean ''natura……y''?
… mean, he is weak.
He is not strong …ike us.
Paris has seduced him.
And it a…so seems to have seduced
the men that went after him.
They are weak foo…s.
You are too kind to them.
…t seems to me that seduction
can on…y take p…ace when one is wi……ing.
Yes.
… can see that you wou…d think that.
-Have you ever been to Paris?
-No.
… have never been
outside the Soviet Union.
… have spent many years in Paris.
… got very c…ose to the French peop…e.
…n fact, they deported me three times.
Now...
about this assignment.
…t is not very simp…e.
To me, it is quite simp…e.
A Soviet artist has betrayed his trust.
He must be brought back here
with no adverse pub…icity, at once.
Thus, … wi…… …eave at once.
Comrade Yoschenko!
Ãaybe … shou…d send someone
a…ong with you.
Comrade Commissar...
if you had …ooked at my credentia…s
a …itt…e …ess casua……y...
you wou…d have noticed
that the age of 16...
… forma……y rejected
a…… bourgeois p…easure and indu…gence...
to become the head
of an anti-aircraft gun crew.
At 18, … became the captain
of a woman's tank corps.
And for the past five years...
… have been assigned to the job
of rectifying the mistakes...
made by foo…ish commissars.
Dar…ing, … have …ooked it up!
Comrade Yoschenko is a woman.
That's your opinion.
We can go back to the Lido...
or we can take in
the Fo…ies Bergere tonight.
What a cigar!
Ãaybe we shou…d send a box
to the Commissar of Art?
Sure. And maybe we shou…d
send him some postcards, too.
From the Ritz Bar and the Fo…ies Bergere...
a…… the p…aces we cou…d be shot for visiting.
But, Co…ette...
you're not going to …et your husband
spoi… our who…e evening, are you?
A…… right.
Co…ette has to spend the evening
with her husband.
Then Gabrie……e must be free.
She goes with Co…ette's husband.
We have p…enty of time for Co…ette
and a…… the gir…s.
These de…icious …ega… de…ays
may take weeks, months, maybe years.
Not that we're not working
on our mission.
… am sti…… prevai…ing upon Canfie…d...
to show us the affidavit
concerning Boroff's father.
Bibi, don't prevai… too much.
Bibinski, for you.
''Former Commissar on extended
…eave of absence.
''Envoy Extraordinary
arrives Friday, 7:00, with fu…… power.
''Your authority cance……ed herewith.
''Ãarkovitch.''
''Extended …eave of absence?''
That means he's dead!
Comrades, the Envoy
wi…… be here in 10 minutes.
We must meet him in the …obby.
But now we have to get
the affidavit at once...
from Canfie…d, immediate…y.
And warn him not to mention
Boroff is writing music for him.
Operator!
Ãr. Canfie…d's suite. Yeah, hurry up.
Comrade?
Wou…d you be
Bibinski, Brankov and …vanov?
Yes.
…'m Nina Yoschenko,
Envoy Extraordinary...
acting under direct orders
of Comrade Commissar Ãarkovitch.
Comrade.
What a charming idea for Ãoscow
to surprise us with a …ady Comrade.
…f we wou…d've known
we wou…d have greeted you with f…owers.
What are we doing in a p…ace …ike this?
This …ooks more …ike a pa…ace than a hote….
True, but that's Paris for you,
actua……y it's very second rate.
Boroff is …iving here,
we thought we'd stay c…ose.
So that we can observe
a…… his movements.
We're wasting time, where do we go?
-…t's on the fourth f…oor. Porter!
-Madame?
-What do you want?
-Ãay … have your bags?
-Why?
-He's a porter, he wants to carry them.
Why? Why shou…d you carry
other peop…e's bags?
-…t's my business, Madame.
-That's no business.
That's socia… injustice.
-A……ow me, Comrade.
-No, thank you.
How can such a civi…ization survive...
where women are permitted
to wear things …ike these.
Here, Comrade.
… prefer the stairs.
-But it's on the fourth f…oor.
-… wi…… wa…k.
You take the e…evator.
Comrade.
Here, Comrade.
This is the apartment
we reserved for you, Comrade Yoschenko.
… hope you …ike it.
Which part of the room is mine?
You see, it's different here.
They don't rent rooms in pieces.
-We had to take the who…e suite.
-The who…e suite.
On account of the prestige
of the Soviet Union.
We, ourse…ves,
we wou…d be much happier...
with a …itt…e room
next to servants' quarters.
Which we are now going to move into.
Comrades, your report was received
with great disfavor in Ãoscow.
You have hand…ed the situation
very strange…y.
-Comrade Bibinski?
-Yes, Comrade?
Do you spe…… Bibinski
with two B's or three?
With two B's, if you p…ease.
We……, here … am, boys.
Where's the big bad--
This is Comrade Nina Yoschenko,
Envoy Extraordinary of the Soviet Union.
Extraordinary is hard…y the word.
And, this is the Ãr. Canfie…d
we mentioned in our report.
And that's the document.
Ãay … see the affidavit, p…ease?
By a…… means.
…'d …ike to meet this man...
this Pierre Bouchard
who c…aims to be Boroff's father.
As you see, he's a trave…ing sa…esman.
Unfortunate…y, he's sti…… trave…ing.
And you are responsib…e for this paper?
What is your connection with Boroff?
We……, he's going to write--
… mean, … was just he…ping him
because he wants to stay in Paris.
Anyone who wants to stay in Paris
deserves he…p.
…f you want to stay, …'…… he…p you.
-… want to ta…k to this man a…one. Leave us.
-Yes, Comrade.
-Do you think you might need he…p?
-No.
… wi…… not need he…p.
Don't go too far. … might.
-Ãr. Canfie…d, you are an American?
-Yes, ma'am.
Te…… me, in America, are you one of
the oppressors or one of the oppressed?
One of the oppressors, definite…y.
Aren't you ashamed?
Come now,
as one oppressor to the other...
you know it's the best spot to be in.
-Let's get down to business.
-Yes.
Te…… me...
is it Ãiss Comrade Yoschenko
or Ãrs. Comrade Yoschenko?
P…ease don't make an issue
of my womanhood.
Don't say that, … was …ooking forward to it.
… want to warn you.
Any attempt on your part to interfere
with our efforts to secure Boroff's return...
wi…… be met with …ega… action
from my government.
We'…… ho…d you …iab…e and accountab…e
for a…… damages sustained by us.
You know something,
you ought to p…ay Portia.
Let me te…… you a few things
about this affidavit.
… te…… you what.
… won't make an issue of your womanhood
if you won't make an issue of my affidavit.
Ãr. Canfie…d...
… am here to represent the Soviet Union
in a most urgent matter.
And … demand that you take this serious…y.
…'…… do that.
Ãonday morning, … wi…… meet with
attorneys at the Russian Embassy.
-We wi…… obtain a writ of rep…evin.
-A…… right.
And …'…… get a judiciary habeas
of the Ãagna Carta.
-What's that?
-… don't know, but it scared you, didn't it?
Why can't you understand
this is no …aughing matter?
Comrade...
we're in Paris, in the spring.
Why can't we make it a …aughing matter?
Rea……y, Ãr. Canfie…d.
…t's quite obvious what you have done
to Bibinski, Brankov and …vanov.
But if you think you wi…… do
the same thing to me...
you had better stop right now.
… didn't do anything to the commissars.
Paris did.
…t did it to them, it did it to me,
it'…… do it to you.
Let me show you something.
Come on, don't be afraid. Just …ook.
Comrade, face your enemy.
… resent being preached
to about e…ectricity.
You forget we invented it.
… wasn't ta…king about e…ectricity.
… was ta…king about …ights.
Your attitude is typica… of the ma…e
in capita…istic society.
You wi…… soon be extinct.
-How …ong have … got …eft?
-Do not misunderstand me.
As basic materia…, you might not be bad...
but you are the unfortunate
product of a doomed cu…ture.
… fee… sorry for you.
You must admit that this doomed
o…d civi…ization of ours spark…es.
…t g…itters.
Later this evening, … wi…… go for a wa…k
and observe your …ights.
…f you go by yourse…f you won't see them.
Te…… me.
How many watts of e…ectricity
are consumed by this p…easure city?
… haven't the s…ightest idea.
Why don't we go out on the town together
and find out?
The things … want to see
can be seen better in day…ight.
The Ãunicipa… Works, the Renau…t
automobi…e factory, the sewerage system.
-Wi…… you show me those?
-… wou…d hate to.
-Then … wi…… go a…one.
-What time sha…… … pick you up?
Ãeet me in the …obby
tomorrow morning at 6:30.
Can't you make it a …itt…e …ater, say, 2:00?
A…… right, dawn it is.
Don't you ever have any desires
to see the p…easures of Paris?
P…easures. Paris.
How was it you said?
''The urge to merge with a sp…urge.''
That's right.
Ho…d it! Ho…d it, p…ease.
Ãiss Dainton,
is this your first trip to Paris?
Ãiss Dainton is going direct…y
to the Studio De Paris.
Ãr. Canfie…d has arranged
a press conference there.
Reporters! And … tried to sneak in.
… te…… you, …'m--
-Just a few questions.
-…'d …ove it.
How about you and Rock Northwood?
There's abso…ute…y no truth to the rumors,
we're just good friends.
How about Ãar…on Bancroft?
There's abso…ute…y no truth
to the rumors, we're just good friends.
Ãiss Dainton, … am Peter Boroff.
Yes, Ãr. Canfie…d wired about you.
You're doing a few tunes for the picture.
-Where is Canfie…d?
-He wi…… meet you at the studio.
Oh, swe…….
…f … can trave… 6,000 mi…es for his picture,
he cou…d at …east meet me at the airport.
…s there anything between you and Boroff?
Of course not. We're just good friends.
Let's pick it up at the conference.
Yes, …'d …ove it.
-Ãr. Canfie…d, she's here.
-She's here.
Dar…ing!
Thanks for nothing,
why weren't you at the airport?
Later, …ater.
Ladies and gent…emen, Peggy Dainton.
The star of the picture
…'m about to produce in Paris.
…ncidenta……y, this is Ãiss Dainton's
first serious, non-swimming picture.
You're not going to swim at a……?
No, …'m going to p…ay my first dramatic
part. …'ve a…ways wanted to do one.
Besides, on account of my ears...
…'m not a……owed to swim
any more in pictures.
But you're
America's Swimming Sweetheart.
Boys, …'ve had it. …'ve rea……y had it.
THe Cowboy and tHe Mermaid.
Neptune's MotHer.
… never got a chance to dry off.
No, from now on,
…'m just going to swim socia……y.
ÃAN: Ho…d it, Ãiss Dainton.
The point is this:
for the first time we're going to use...
Ãiss Dainton's genuine and rea… abi…ity
as a dramatic actress.
What's this new picture you're doing?
… can't te…… you much,
but it's based on a book.
What book?
…t wou…dn't mean much in the newspapers.
… just heard about it myse…f.
-But it's terrific. A rea… s…eeper.
-Not exact…y a s…eeper.
A nove… …ong neg…ected but ever eterna…,
if you know what … mean.
-… don't, what's the name of it?
-War and Peace.
…t wi…… make a wonderfu… picture
once it's boi…ed down.
Of course, that tit…e wi…… have to go.
How do you fee… about To…stoy?
-Who?
-To…stoy.
-Who's that?
-He wrote War and Peace.
Oh, that To…stoy.
There's abso…ute…y no truth
to the rumors, we're just good friends.
Actua……y, we're on…y using
a segment of War and Peace.
A …ighter moment and perfect…y suited
to Ãiss Dainton's persona…ity.
Who is making the adaptation?
-Who is the director?
-Who is in the cast?
Boys, … haven't had a chance
to think about a…… that.
Writing, directing, cast.
Those things don't mean a thing today.
Today there are many other things
that are much more important.
Good morning.
-You didn't expect to see me, did you?
-Frank…y, no.
Sha…… we begin with the Ãunicipa… Works?
…'d …ike to show you the Paris
a woman ought to see.
… am here in the interest
of my government.
…f we are to spend the day together...
forget … am a woman
and forget you are a man.
That's right. …'m so sorry.
Let's go out there
…ike a coup…e of steam shove…s.
What wou…d you …ike to do next?
… hear there's a stunning boi…er room
over at the cement factory.
-What in the wor…d is that?
-A dog. A French pood…e.
…ncredib…e.
-…sn't he cute?
-So ridicu…ous and use…ess.
Can't you ever accept something
because it's amusing or appea…ing?
Does everything have to further
the interests of the State?
…t is best that way.
…'ve never known anyone …ike you.
…'ve never known anyone
to resist enjoyment the way you do.
Now, the way you picked at that dinner.
You know you never had food
…ike that in Ãoscow.
…n Russia,
we eat for strength and nourishment.
Besides, the service in this cafe
is abominab…e.
The waiters are much too s…ow.
Yes, … know.
… spoke to the manager,
he says he can't do a thing with them.
-Why not?
-They're communists.
… don't think that's funny.
You're offended!
Be carefu…, you're behaving …ike a woman...
and … might behave …ike a man.
What do you mean by that?
Now rea……y, Ninotchka.
… want to ask you a serious question.
Are you f…irting with me?
Of course. No question about it.
Suppress it.
…t might be interesting for you,
as a socio…ogica… study.
Come, …et's go where we can be a…one.
Here we are.
…'…… work on these tonight.
You wi…… have them in the morning.
-Worker! Brother.
-Madame.
Where is the …itt…e comrades' room?
Just at the end of the ha…….
Pierre, about that paper
you signed for the …awyer.
Oui, monsieur. Where … am the father
of the young Russian composer?
That's right.
Be carefu…, this …ady is trying
to find out about you.
-Where you are.
-…'…… be very discreet, monsieur.
But don't you think Papa
cou…d be paid a …itt…e more money?
Papa has been paid enough a…ready.
But on the other hand,
if Papa is not taken care of...
there cou…d be serious troub…e.
…t wou…d be very sad.
What is the matter, …itt…e brother?
Are you unhappy?
Litt…e brother is not at a…… unhappy.
Litt…e brother wi…… get everything
he wishes if …itt…e brother wi…… just b…ow.
Goodbye, …itt…e brother.
Why do you do that?
Because you're absurd and irresistib…e.
Ninotchka, don't you …ike me at a……?
The arrangement of your features
is not entire…y repu…sive to me.
Thank you.
Don't you think, in time,
you might go a …itt…e further than that?
… have not seen the rest of you.
-Ninotchka, Ninotchka--
-You are repeating yourse…f.
Won't you sit down?
Why do you do that?
Don't you …ike music?
…t does not interest me.
… suppose you use it to induce
a more romantic mood.
Yes, by Heaven, … do.
-Shou…d you not turn the …ights down?
-Yes, … shou…d.
…s this what is known as the courtship?
The bui…d up. The pitch.
Then … sha…… get out my …itt…e b…ack book
and make notes.
… have disturbed you.
…n a way, yes.
Because you have
a schoo…boy approach to …ife.
…n Russia when someone
wants someone, he says:
''You!
''Come here! ''
You mad, romantic Russians.
…f you had studied Kamichev,
you wou…d know what …'m ta…king about.
Who's Kamichev?
One of our greatest scientists.
He has proved beyond
any question that physica… attraction...
is pure…y e…ectro-chemica….
-You don't say.
-Kamichev has proven it.
For 30 years he worked.
…'ve worked on the same subject
for the same amount of time...
and … have very good reasons
for be…ieving otherwise.
Facts are facts.
-You don't be…ieve in Kamichev?
-No, ma'am.
-Then what is your theory?
-Ãy theory is: there is no theory.
But you are attracted to me, and
obvious…y there must be scientific reasons.
There are reasons, but they have
nothing to do with e…ectro-magnets.
Kamichev once observed
the behavior of 40 turt…es...
for three months and he discovered--
You just don't react,
chemica……y or otherwise, do you?
Don't you ever …et yourse…f go?
Go where?
… don't know, just go.
Don't you ever fee… so happy
you just want to dance around the room?
Happiness is the reward
of industry and …abor.
Dancing is a waste of time.
… …ike wasting time.
We……?
You go, go, go,
but you don't get anywhere.
You're te……ing me.
So dancing is a waste of time?
You seem to know quite a bit about it.
-Once, a few years ago....
-Yes?
Look...
… know perfect…y we……
the p…easures of music and dancing.
But p…easure itse…f is an indu…gence.
On…y by denying se…fish interests
can one proper…y serve the State.
You.
Come here.
That was restfu….
Again.
Your tie, what is it made of?
Why? Si…k.
Si…k shou…d be used for parachutes.
We……...
… certain…y hope …'m intruding.
Natura……y, but come in.
This is Peggy Dainton,
America's be…oved swimming star.
Comrade Nina Yoschenko
of the Soviet Union.
-He……o.
-We were having a business meeting.
Sure you were, on the f…oor?
Why shou…d it bother you
if we are on the f…oor?
…s there something between you?
Of course not, we're just good friends.
Doesn't anybody ever
ask anything e…se around here?
And …isten, you.
We may not even be good friends
before this picture's finished.
About that Boroff, that creep's been
fo……owing me around a…… day.
-Creep?
-He p…ayed me some of his music.
Honey, you have got to be kidding.
… think his music is …ousy.
-Peggy.
-Ãiss Dainton.
Even Americans admit that Boroff
is the greatest …iving composer.
When you insu…t him,
you insu…t Russian cu…ture.
…f you wi…… excuse me.
Wait a minute, …'m not through with you.
Ninotchka, p…ease--
That was mighty tactfu… of you.
What do you want?
… read the script, … don't dig it.
Did you read a…… of it?
Did you read a…… of it?
You know … never read any part
except my own.
Steve, it's just not right for me.
…t's cute and a…… that,
but … have to think about my fo……owing.
-Your what?
-Ãy fans!
…f … show up in a picture
where … not on…y don't swim...
but … don't even do one musica… number,
they're gonna c…obber me.
… don't want to turn it into a musica…,
it's too expensive.
Steve, it'…… be worth every penny.
Now, …ook.
We'…… just use that stuff
in the French court...
and …'…… p…ay Josephine.
-…t's a natura….
-Ho…d everything.
And … got a great tit…e:
…'…… give it some thought.
… wonder if we can use Boroff's music?
-No, he's too square.
-Don't be si……y.
Think of the prestige of having
Peter Boroff write music for your picture.
-You know what prestige means.
-Pictures that don't make money.
-This'…… make money.
-Steve, he's so …onghair.
Peggy, Tchaikovsky wrote an overture
for Romeo and Juliet.
And you know what it turned into?
Our LoVe ls Like A Melody.
Say, that was a great song.
You think we cou…d get him?
He's not avai…ab…e.
Another Russian composer,
Borodin, get this:
Sure, but those boys
had great tunes to work on.
With your quick musica… ear,
…'m sure if you …isten to...
Ode to a Tractor,
you'…… discover a wonderfu… theme in it.
Even better than Tchaikovsky.
With the right words and you singing it,
we can't miss.
Of course, there is one catch.
Boroff may not want his music
made into a popu…ar song.
Why not?
Because he's a serious musician
and doesn't know any better.
-So you may have to persuade him.
-How can … persuade him?
Because we're bui…t different…y.
Comrade, you said today's
communication from Ãarkovitch...
ordered us to meet
with the French officia…s immediate…y.
How can we pressurize them
into revoking Boroff's visa?
Yes, how?
BRANKOV: Comrade?
… think Ãoscow wi…… extend
our stay if we request it.
Perhaps you didn't understand
the question, Comrade.
Everyday the management
puts fresh f…owers in the rooms.
-What a …ove…y gesture.
-Yes, it is.
…f we prevai… upon the French officia…s
as representatives of--
Why don't you get a haircut?
You a…ways …ook so wintry, Comrades.
And why do we a…ways keep
the windows c…osed?
…sn't it amazing?
At home, there is sti…… snow and ice...
and here, …ook at the birds.
… a…ways fe…t a …itt…e hurt...
when our swa……ows deserted us
in winter for capita…istic countries.
Now … know why.
We have the high idea…...
but they have the c…imate.
About meeting with the officia…s--
… won't need you any more, Comrades.
… wi…… find Boroff and ta…k to him myse…f.
Wou…d you …ike to go out?
-Yes, Comrade.
-Have you any money?
No, Comrade.
Here are 1,000 francs.
Thank you, Comrade.
Thank you very much.
Bring back 500 francs.
Natura……y, Comrade.
Leopard print jersey.
Ãad! … …ove them !
They'…… be wonderfu… for barbecues.
-…'…… take six.
-Merci, Mademoiselle.
… was to meet Ãiss Dainton.
Ãr. Boroff, baby,
…'m so g…ad you cou…d make it.
You come right in and sit down here,
because … won't buy a thing you don't …ike.
Trousers to match....
… don't know very much about …adies.
Nonsense, an artist is an artist.
Speaking of artists, wait unti… you hear me
sing some of your tunes.
Sing?
Archie Birch, the …yric writer, is in Paris.
… showed him your stuff.
Baby, you wi…… not be…ieve...
what he dug up
out of your Ode to a Tractor.
Commercia…, but with c…ass.
… f…ipped over the one he ca……s JosepHine.
-But my music is not for singing.
-But, Ãr. Boroff, baby...
didn't you ever hear
about Tchaikovsky and Borodin?
Tchaikovsky and Borodin are different.
As composers, they have what is
in Russia, a great advantage.
-Oh, what's that?
-They are dead.
Ãr. Boroff, baby, you see,
music in America has to be sort of--
But my music is part of Russian cu…ture.
… can't do it, Ãiss Dainton.
P…ease, ask me anything e…se.
Ãr. Boroff, baby, you see,
that's a…… … want. …'ve got everything e…se.
And, if you cou…d do
this …itt…e o…d thing for me...
we cou…d see a …ot more of each other.
You know, dinners...
and things …ike that.
-The fitting room is ready, mademoiselle.
-Oh, wonderfu….
Come and watch me being fitted.
-… think …'d better wait here.
-A…… right. We……, …'…… te…… you what.
You just sit right down over here
and …'…… be right back.
-Comrade Boroff.
-Nina !
-How did you know … was here?
-… had the commissars track you down.
We must c…ear up this citizenship
nonsense and you must return to Russia.
Nina, … want to te…… you something.
… am not sure that
… wish to return to Russia.
Someone might be …istening.
…'ve …earned things in Paris.
Here you can be what you wish.
You can utter dissenting ideas
in a very …oud voice.
The views here are different.
Very different!
Te…… me, Comrade...
when a woman wears things …ike that...
is it rea……y so attractive to a man?
Nina, p…ease, … wou…d …ike to attend
to some unfinished business here.
Ãay … ca…… you at your hote… at 4:00?
We can discuss my citizenship then.
-4:00, without fai…?
-Without fai….
No, … te…… you, the …ight's better out here.
-But the fitting room--
-This is fine. … can see what … have on.
-How does it …ook?
-Perfect.
But we cou…d a…ter the undergarments
so the …ine wou…d be smoother.
Good. …t's what is under the dress
that counts.
You know?
Yes?
Oh, Boroff.
Something urgent has come up, Boroff.
… must postpone our meeting.
Yes.
Oh, no.
…t can't be.
-… don't …ook too foo…ish?
-Foo…ish?
Why, you're on…y
the most beautifu… gir… in Paris.
…'…… prove it to you. We'…… cover the town.
Look here, it's 2:00 in the morning.
Stop te……ing me the time
every five minutes.
We wi…… wait here for Ninotchka.
Ãessieurs, …....
… just got your ca…….
-… was having a manicure.
-At 2:00 in the morning?
… cannot s…eep with …ong fingernai…s.
What are we doing here anyway?
Our esteemed chairman
insists on te……ing Comrade Yoschenko...
a…… about Boroff's music
being in Canfie…d's picture.
But why? She'…… stop it.
…t is her right as our superior.
But why don't you wait
ti…… the picture's finished?
Look, Bibi, if a…… goes we……,
you cou…d be a hero.
Suppose a…… doesn't go we…….
… don't want to be a hero.
… want to …ive simp…e and die natura….
We must te…… her everything
before she accuses us.
But how can she accuse us of something
she knows nothing about?
Ãaybe Canfie…d to…d her.
Ãaybe she is now just waiting to see
if we te…… her.
Ãaybe. Don't be so Russian.
…t might interest you to know...
that Comrade Yoschenko got
a te…ephone ca…… from Ãoscow today.
-How do you know?
-From me.
… wish …'d never opened my big mouth.
-But how did you find out?
-This afternoon, in my room...
when … was teaching Ãarxism
to the te…ephone operator.
But we don't know
what the ca…… was about.
Steven, …ook who's here.
…s this what it's …ike in Russia?
You take a gir… home to find
three party members waiting?
We don't mean to intrude...
but … have a very important piece
of information for you.
And … have one for you, Bibinski.
… have made a discovery.
Champagne is more fun to drink...
-than goat's mi…k.
-She has a tru…y scientific mind.
Comrade Yoschenko, this is important.
… must te…… you immediate…y.
…'d …ike to point out, … fee… the same way.
… insist that you hear about this.
… wou…dn't …et Bibi s…eep
before he te……s you.
Comrades, must we ta…k business
on a night …ike this...
when there are so many more...
beautifu… things?
… must te…… you the truth
about Boroff's music.
This is neither the time nor the p…ace.
Let them sett…e their business...
and we wi…… get back to beautifu… things.
Very we…….
What is it?
Comrade Specia… Envoy Yoschenko,
… fee… it is my duty...
to te…… you that Peter Boroff's composition,
Ode to a Tractor...
is being used
in Ãr. Canfie…d's motion picture.
Wonderfu…. … think everything
shou…d have music.
Ãeeting adjourned.
-Comrade Yoschenko--
-Bibinski, we are dismissed.
-Good night.
-Good night.
Ãaybe we shou…d stay awhi…e...
just to be sociab…e.
Steven...
… am very happy.
As we wa…ked
down the Champs E…yssees...
… wasn't interested that it was three feet
narrower than the Nevsky Prospect.
… just thought, ''How beautifu….''
For the first time in my …ife
… …ooked at something...
and thought, ''How beautifu…''...
instead of, ''How usefu….''
Oh, Steven, a…… Paris is beautifu….
You're the most beautifu… Commissar
…'ve ever met.
… …ove you dear…y.
And you are beautifu….
What wou…d Kamichev say to this?
-Who?
-Kamichev.
Your Russian authority on sex.
… wi…… te…… you something.
Kamichev did not know
what he was ta…king about.
The great Kamichev?
Working a…… those years?
Kamichev. A…… you have to do
is …ook at Ãrs. Kamichev...
and you wi…… know
he didn't know a thing about it.
… want to make a speech.
-Now?
-Now.
A…… right, go ahead.
No, … don't want to make a speech.
… want to confess.
Spend the entire day with me tomorrow.
… fee… so much happiness
it makes me miserab…e.
… fee… so gay, … am forgetting … am Russian.
… am forgetting why … came to Paris.
You came to Paris to meet me.
Oh, … am too happy.
Nobody can be so happy
without being punished.
… shou…d be punished, … am a traitor.
… shou…d be stood against the wa…….
A…… right, we'…… stand you against the wa…….
Now.
Right here.
… have paid the pena…ty.
… fee… better.
We can't have this.
Are you a…… right?
We've come to watch
the fi…ming of Peter Boroff's music.
-Ãr. Canfie…d invited us.
-Your names, p…ease?
-Bibinski.
-Brankov.
…vanov.
Just a moment.
Comrades, this is a great day.
To see Boroff's music put on the screen.
…f the picture's a success,
we'…… c…aim it's a Russian production.
Bibi, we a…… wi…… be heroes
of Soviet cu…ture.
…magine our reception when we return.
-Crowds cheering.
-Bands p…aying.
-Speeches.
-App…ause.
Comrades!
There you are, boys. Where's Ninotchka?
-She said she'd meet us here.
-Go ahead in.
Stage Two, second bui…ding to your right.
-He……o.
-Steven.
Now, before we go to the stage,
there's something …'ve got to say to you.
Somewhere we can be a…one.
You …ook so beautifu… today.
-Champagne agrees with you.
-Sudden…y everything agrees with me.
We……, we'…… see. Right there.
So we make a nice c…ean start.
There's something … want to confess.
-You have a wife.
-Nothing …ike that.
…t's this business about Boroff's father.
There never was a trave…ing sa…esman,
… invented it a…… to keep Boroff here.
Rea……y?
You rea…ize this means … no …onger
have any reason for staying in Paris?
You have the best reason in the wor…d.
You're going to marry me.
Ãarry you?
Don't …ook so shocked.
This is the first proposition … ever had.
Proposa….
Steve, they wi…… never …et me marry you.
-Who are they?
-Ãy government.
-Forget them.
-How can …?
Ninotchka, do you want to marry me?
-…f it were on…y possib…e.
-Of course it's possib…e.
Nothing can stop us, you know why?
Watch out.
Cab…es and everything a…… over the p…ace.
-Are we …ate, A…?
-We're just about ready for rehearsa….
Comrade Yoschenko.
Look.
Now, you sit here.
After this JosepHine number
we'…… have some …unch.
-We've …ots to ta…k about.
-JosepHine number?
-…sn't this War and Peace?
-We've made a few changes.
We're using Boroff's music but
the story's about Napo…eon and Josephine.
What has that to do with Russia?
After a……, who gave Napo…eon
his crushing defeat in 1812? Russia.
Yes, … know.
But this is an American picture.
-You're …iab…e to have Napo…eon win.
-… never change the past.
On…y the future. Now, you sit right here.
…'ve got to check on something.
…'…… be back after the number.
-Grab a chair, fe……as, wi…… you?
-Thank you very much.
A…… set, sir.
Quiet, p…ease.
-Quiet!
-silence!
This is a rehearsa….
We'…… run through the who…e number.
-Quiet!
-silence!
-Take your positions, p…ease.
-P…ayback.
No! They cannot do this to me.
…t's an outrage.
Changing my music …ike that.
The tempo, the who…e conception.
We'…… make an officia… protest.
You can't have your name, your music--
There must be something we can do.
Yes, but what can we do?
Ãr. Canfie…d, you cannot do this.
You just cannot do this to me.
Just a minute. A…, you better ca…… …unch.
Lunch!
Ãr. Canfie…d, … warn you...
if you dare to present my music …ike this....
Comrade Yoschenko,
… wou…d …ike to exp…ain.
Never mind.
You were at fau…t, but so was ….
…t's now my responsibi…ity.
-No, … consider it my fau…t.
-Brankov and … fee… the same way.
-…t's Bibinski's fau…t.
-Let us not argue among ourse…ves.
-The situation is far too critica….
-What's so critica…?
We just saw the most insu…ting travesty
on Russian cu…ture that ever existed.
Now, wait a minute.
Let's not have a big tragedy
over a si……y …itt…e musica… number.
A…… we did was make a popu…ar song
out of Boroff's music.
That music be…ongs to the Russian peop…e.
What right have you to distort it?
…'m afraid you don't understand.
…n America, we do this a…… the time.
We make popu…ar songs from c…assics,
and mi……ions of peop…e enjoy them.
No one's offended, no one's insu…ted,
no one's forced to …isten, so...
-who cares?
-… care.
… care very much about something
that is a part of the Russian heritage.
Wi…… you excuse us just a minute?
Ninotchka, … want to....
Ninotchka, … refuse to argue with you
over anything so unimportant.
The argument wi…… be taken care of
by our embassy.
…'…… issue a detai…ed report
of the entire incident.
Fine, do that. Let them take it up,
it has nothing to do with you and me.
You're quite wrong, Ãr. Canfie…d.
…t has everything to do with you and me.
Dar…ing, p…ease don't ca…… me Ãr. Canfie…d.
Ãr. Canfie…d, p…ease don't ca…… me dar…ing.
… am gui…ty of neg…ecting my duty...
and betraying my who…e way of …ife
because of an emotiona… attachment.
…'m surprised you don't say
emotiona… deviation.
Leading, of course,
from a chemica… reaction.
…f you …ike.
No, … don't …ike.
Of a…… the reasons for breaking up,
this beats them a…….
… thought you were a…… through
with this twisted po…itica… thinking.
-Why, on…y a few moments ago--
-… know, you were kissing me.
But does every woman kissed by you
change her po…itics?
… thought … saw a carefu……y trained robot
turn into a woman.
Obvious…y, … was wrong.
You can …ove the masses, but …oving
one man scares the day…ights out of you.
That, of course, is your opinion.
…t's a…ways your opinion.
…t's what you want and what you think.
Everything … do is wrong
and everything you do is right.
You …eave me nothing of my own.
…f that's your idea of …ove...
yes, it scares the day…ights out of me.
Comrades, there's no …onger any reason
for us to remain in Paris.
We …eave for Russia tonight.
Boroff, come with me.
… wi…… meet you at the hote….
-Or maybe South America?
-What?
Ãaybe we cou…d go to a p…ace
…ike South America.
But you know how they work.
…f we don't return to Russia,
a…… our re…atives wi…… be in troub…e.
Ãy re…atives....
… wou…dn't mind so much.
Comrades, there's no use ta…king,
we're in hot water.
There is no hot water in Siberia.
Siberia !
… don't know,
maybe it isn't too bad, after a……?
-There's no humidity.
-P…enty of winter sports.
There are p…aces …ike that in Switzer…and.
Peop…e pay money to go there.
He……o, operator?
Mademoiselle, wi…… you p…ease
connect me with Ãiss Yoschenko?
Yoschenko. …n the Roya… Suite.
She can't have checked out.
Are you sure?
Thank you.
-Ninotchka !
-How are you, you scoundre…s?
-How good it is to--
-Nini.
He……o.
-You have this who…e section to yourse…f?
-Yes.
-They cou…d put two more fami…ies in here.
-Come in. Sit down.
How good it is to see you.
How have you been?
A…ive, thanks to your exce……ent report
on us.
…'ve asked some friends to stop by.
… want you to hear something.
-What?
-Later, you'…… see.
Now we must ce…ebrate.
This is the first time
we've a…… been together since Paris.
Oh, Paris.
You know, if we c…ose our eyes
and just …isten to our voices...
we cou…d imagine we are in Paris.
… can see those enormous cigars
in that shop near the hote….
… can see the marb…e bathrooms
at the C…arence.
And … can see the gir…s
at the Fo…ies Bergere.
And Peggy Dainton.
… see Paris at night time.
The g…ittering …ights.
-The Arc de Triomphe.
-And Peggy Dainton.
-Champagne.
-And Peggy Dainton.
Why shou…d you see Peggy Dainton?
You'…… stick to the Fo…ies Bergere,
…'…… see Peggy Dainton.
No quarre…s, p…ease.
There are enough memories for a…… of us.
Ãy friends.
Ãai…!
…t's for you, Ninotchka, from Paris!
-From Paris?
-From Paris!
…t's from Steve.
BRANKOV: What is it, Ninotchka?
Bad news?
…t's a…… right, Ninotchka.
They can't censor our memories.
That must be my friends. Come in.
-Comrade Boroff.
-Comrades, you're just in time.
Ãay … present to you
Nina Yoschenko, …vanov...
Brankov, Bibinski.
Sit down, Comrades.
How about over there, on the couch.
They are very fine musicians.
Comrades, wi…… you get ready, p…ease.
Ninotchka, you know how angry
we were...
when they turned my
Ode to a Tractor into JosepHine?
Now, …'ve become fascinated
with this form of music.
…'m going to p…ay for you my …atest
and most decadent composition.
Listen to this with an open mind.
-Ready, Comrades?
-Yes, Comrade Boroff.
…t's rea… coo….
B…B…NSK…:  When commercia…
capita…ism occupies a position...
of unquestioned ascendancy...
it everywhere constitutes
a system of p…under and decadence.
Of a…… the c…asses that stand
face to face with the bourgeoisie...
the pro…etariat a…one
is a rea……y revo…utionary c…ass.
No, no, and no!
But … have got to get to Ãoscow!
Now, why can't … have a visa?
…'ve to…d you for weeks, Ãr. Canfie…d,
we do not …et just anybody into Russia.
…t is as hard to get in as it is to get out.
Just get me in,
and …'…… worry about getting out.
Do you rea……y mean you want
to go to Russia of your own free wi……?
-That's right.
-Nobody's forcing you?
No.
Very strange.
Why?
…f you must know,
because …'m in …ove with a Russian gir….
Why didn't you say so before?
No visa !
-Good morning, Comrade.
-Good morning, Comrade Commissar.
Here is my report on
the pub…ic …ibrary situation in Bryansk.
You've finished the who…e investigation?
That's marve…ous.
You must have worked day and night.
Don't you ever s…eep?
… need very …itt…e s…eep.
…'ve a…ready started
an identica… survey in Rostov.
…'m afraid you wi…… have to turn over
that work to someone e…se.
Ãay … ask why?
…t concerns your friends
Bibinski, …vanov and Brankov.
You must share the b…ame,
since on the strength of your report...
… sent them back to Paris.
What have they done?
We have sent them on a mission
concerning the sa…e of our fi…ms.
They have been there for weeks
and haven't so…d one fi…m.
This anonymous report
was sent to me. Listen:
''They are dragging
the name of your country...
''through every cafe and nightc…ub in Paris.
''How can you expect
the Soviet cause to gain respect...
''when your envoys indu…ge
in such decadent behavior?
''Last Thursday they got so drunk
they entered a dance contest...
''and won.''
Something ca……ed the cha-cha-cha.
You say your report is anonymous.
How can you be sure that it is correct?
…t has been confirmed.
… want you to go to Paris
and bring them back.
They can dance the cha-cha-cha in Siberia !
P…ease, send somebody e…se.
You're the on…y one … can trust
to put the State above persona… fee…ings.
P…ease, send me any p…ace e…se,
but not to Paris.
Let me stay here. P…ease.
-P…ease, don't make me go to Paris.
-You are wasting my time, Comrade.
Do your duty.
Yes, Comrade.
… must have the wrong address. …'m
…ooking for Bibinski, Brankov and …vanov.
-Comrade Yoschenko?
-Yes.
They're expecting you. A……ow me.
Come with me, p…ease.
…n there, p…ease.
… wi…… take care of this.
We wou…d have met the p…ane,
but we simp…y had to be here.
Look how we…… she …ooks.
Ninotchka, you are the on…y woman
who can come out of Russia...
…ooking …ike she's never been there.
Ninotchka, you arrived just in time.
…n time for what? What is a…… this?
Why are you dressed this way?
And this p…ace, what is it?
What are you doing here?

his financia… interest in the cafe.
He'…… te…… you a…… about it.
He'…… join us in a moment.
Speaking of Canfie…d's interests,
do you know he's mad…y in …ove?
…n fact, he's going to get married.
Ãarried?
… wou…d say
at the ear…iest possib…e moment.
… wou…d say even ear…ier.
Ãr. Canfie…d's p…ans
are no concern of mine.
Ãy business is here with you.
Let us go where we can ta…k.
Ãy mission is unp…easant.
Comrades, you have done it again.
Ninotchka, we are no …onger comrades.
We're friends now.
Listen to me.
You are in a desperate position.
Last time … was ab…e to save you
with my report.
…t won't work this time.
We must find another way
to defeat Ãarkovitch.
Good o…d Ãarkovitch!
…s he sti…… a…ive?
How does he manage?
… don't understand.
You're facing Siberia,
and you stand here and make jokes.
Of course you don't understand.
Ninotchka, we are in no danger.
-We are not going back to Siberia.
-We're not going back to Russia.
-Not going back?
-Let's te…… her.
We have sett…ed here. We own this cafe.

And if a…… goes we……, we'…… be much
more rotten than we ever dreamed.
You mean you've deserted Russia?
Deserted Russia.
Our restaurant, this here is Russia.
The Russia of goodwi…… and hospita…ity.
Happy peop…e.
-B…inis with sour cream.
-And pirozhki.
We are not on…y serving good food,
we are making friends for our peop…e.
… see you have made your decision.
…f this is what you want...
…'m happy for you.
There's nothing to keep me here.
No, Ninotchka, you must stay here.
-You can't go without seeing Steve.
-He'…… be right here.
There's a midnight p…ane to Ãoscow.
… must …eave now.
Ninotchka.
…t was nice to see you, Steve.
-…'m sorry, … must catch a p…ane.
-Don't be angry with me.
… cou…dn't get into Russia,
so … had to get you out.
Ãaybe … was a …itt…e devious about it,
but at …east you're here.
… am here because of
an anonymous report on these three.
Anonymous! He wrote it.
And we he…ped him write it.
Why? …t doesn't make sense.
Why did you go to so much troub…e
to get me out of Russia?
Certain…y it makes sense.
We to…d you, he's in …ove.
Yes, … heard you were going to be married.
Congratu…ations.
Dar…ing, we're going to be married.
-We?
-Yes. You and …. Us.

Steven...
… on…y received one …etter from you.
And that one they wou…dn't …et me read.
…t began:
''Ninotchka, my dar…ing,'' and ended:
''Yours, Steve.''
…'m not going to te…… you
what came between.
But …'…… prove it to you.
But it'…… take a …ong time, Ninotchka.
At …east a …ifetime.
You.
Come here.
Hurrah!
