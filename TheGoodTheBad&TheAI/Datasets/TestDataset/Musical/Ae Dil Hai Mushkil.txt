What's wrong with this city?
Somewhere there are ashes
and somewhere smoke.
Why doesn't someone say something?
Why do we endure smoke quietly?
Now it's the limit of endurance.
Let's bring this reckless act to an end.
Smoking at public places is prohibited.
Violation will lead to penalty.
Don't smoke. Or let others smoke.
You will have to pay
a heavy price for smoking.
Who doesn't want to be happy?
But at what price?
You will have to pay
a heavy price for smoking.
Smoking is injurious for you.
And for your dear ones
You will have to pay
a heavy price for smoking.

No, no, no...
My love isn't unfulfilled...

I'd only heard of the
power of one-sided love...
NOW  understand M
Does this love have a name?
What kind of hug was that?!
- Means?
- 'Mmmmm'!
I wasn't aware that
hugs had standards.
Listen... Save these sentimental
hugs for your family...

chosen by my father...
Won't take too long to flop.

Did you feel bad?!
Why so touchy, baby?
Just... Fought with my girlfriend.
I fought with my boyfriend, too!
Just two lost souls
swimming in a fish bowl!
Filmy!
Totally! Why'd you guys fight?
If I tell you, you'll judge me...
Oh, I've already judged
you with that 'kiss'.
- Just tell me!
So... we were late for this party...
...so when I saw Lisa, I asked her why
she hadn't worn her clothes, yet...
And she said...
"I'm already dressed!"
No way!
Short or skimpy?
Both! She showed up
in a bikini, I swear!
Marv n: up m hen

You're so judgmental!
Happily judgmental!

You must be close to your dad, right?

- Sorry...
I sing really well! Lots of people
think I sing like Mohammed Rafi...
Shall I sing for you?
What did I ever do to you?
And doesn't Mohammed Rafi

And not of laughing, either!
I take the road less taken...
Life.

He was as absorbed in his music...

I thought we were in love...
he never bothered to correct rne.
But, in truth,
he was the love of my life...
...and I was just his habit.
So, ma: happened?
What could happen?
He found another habit...
Decided that was love.
She was this goddamned
beautiful airhostess...
She showed him where
her emergency exits were...
Wand that was that.
And me and my broken
heart found our Way m London
But you still love him?
That question makes me feel weak...
So thank God for Dr. Faisal...
At least he's nice to look at...

Hindi's beautiful, too...
Only when Mr. Baohohan speaks

She loves that show...
Yeah, I love it!
He totally nails hindi!
He used this word once...
'Vaatavaram
And I was like, "Oh my God!
I love that word!
What does it mean?
Ayan said it means...
"Vibe"!
So me and the girls

I just love the
"vaatavaran" of this club...
I just love the
"vaatavaran" of this bar...
I just love the word.

What is this?
It's for you!
To hell with Lisa!
'
I came to apologise.
VVith this?
What' you Wm flowers?
Yew
hate flowers
What did flowers ever do to you?
Flowers are so overrated!
Yeah, they look pretty...
smell nice...
...but colours fade
and scent disappears...
...and what you're left with
is lifeless, wilted and diseased.
Thorns, on the other hand...
They're not so fragile...
Thorns are fearless...
I don't want to be just a flower...
I want to be a thorn.
I want to smack you!
Though she be little,
but she is fierce!
Please sir, share your gruel...
God, take it already...
May a thousand
Gods shine upon you...
You have to admit...
songs of the 80's were amazing...
Cheap, vulgar and extra tacky!
My playlist is 'Cheap Thrills'!
No way... mine is
'Jolly Good Bollywood"!
Most famous song of the 80's?
- Film?
- Himmatwala!
Cheapest song?
Film'?
Maqsad, 1984!
You're not my long
lost brother, are you?
No but maybe the Doctor is!
Hopefully he'll
just be long lost!
So... what are you

I'm very busy...
Meetings, appointments...
Shut up! You're free!
Okay x arm
- What's the problem?
- Problem?
I saw you busting
your moves at home...
...what's with the
dainty flailing now?
It's embarrassing.
Embarrassing?
Embarrassment is just a fancy
word for self-importance.
You're nobody here!
So you're not shaming
Daddy Dearest...
Nor are you embarrassing yourself!
Just dance, man!
I can't dance in groups... only sing.
Oh, really?
And that's amazing...
...but this isn't choir
practice - it's a dance class!
It's just not my scene...
Shh! Just dance!
Forget your inner Lois Lane...
...you were born to be Wonder Woman!
In the name of JLo's sex appeal...

Because, Celine Dion...
Your self-praise is
driving me up the wall!
You're not taking me seriously...
My voice is a gift from God!
Then sing for Him!
No!
Don't be so attention seeking, man!
What if you fall in love with me?
Well, Mr. Casablanca...
I'll take my chances!
Come on... Sing.

Not singing?
This is your last chance...
Nov
Okay... then get lost!
How was that?
Abhorrent!
Ab-wh at?
That sounded like
an ad for constipation!
Yum
Following a tune isn't singing...
It had no pain... no emotion...
- And you're an expert, so...
- I'm the audience!
There was no feeling.
Because this...
has never been broken.
You'll only really sing
when it does break.
then' you can do your MBA,
make some money
...and leave music alone.
See you later... Bye!

Twice I thought he'd come...
Both times I waited for him...
And both times, he didn't come.
Mademoiselle, we are Private Jet

My best friend...

I don't know...
You know, I wasn't popular in school...
They thought I was a weirdo,
freak, introverted...
And honestly, it made no difference...
You know Wm
Because I knew I was
holding on to my personality...
I was waiting to find that one person...
...who got my weirdness.

Don't feel weird...
I don't love you or anything.
No, no... I know that.
You know,

lust just kills friendship...
Love is passion...
...but friendship is peace.
And I never, ever want
to lose the peace between us.
Girlfriend, boyfriend, husband, wife...

the people just leave.
And I never want to leave you, Ayan...

You're spinning like a top!
You're seriously like Mohd. Rafi!
I was wrong about you, man!
You really can sing!

Pain?
Love?

Did I sing with love today?
Who was it for?
Who was it for...
Should I tell you?
No
But you must know
I love you, Alizeh.
I love you...
I'm madly in love with you.
And now, it's too late...
Now, I want that DJ Ali
to die in the wedding procession...
And from that shock,
I want you to die, too.

But I don't want to be alone.

Nice to meet you, Ms. Wright.
I'm Ayan.
I write poetry.
My name is Saba.
Oh!
Too good
We'll chat on the flight...
Wan 'm you hear
some of my stones
What's up?
Chatter is a fool's pursuit.
Your eyes can't hide
what your words conceal.
Why we your tears?
Don't imprison them...

- That's me
- That's me
Listen, it was really
amazing meeting you...
Thanks for listening...
And sorry... I think...
I fell asleep, talking.
Well, you were even
talking in your sleep...
Shit! What did I say?
Relax.
Ayan
I know words can't always
heal soars that run so deep...
But words are all I have...
So here, this is for you!
I hope it helps a little...
And if words aren't your thing...
Maybe the number Wm new
Have a nice flight.
Thank you! Same to you!
People always say
heart over mind...
But when
Shouldn't you follow your mind?
?
- Chatter is a fool's
pursuit... or so I've heard...
- But old habits die hard...
I've been rather
impatient for this call...
?
Sorry, my cheeks are turning pink...
You make me blush...
It's true, though...
You've told me
everything about you...
...and you know nothing about me...
Why do you mm rm here?
Where?
Vienna...
What are you doing here?
Crossed the boundary
to cross some boundaries...
That's tough
- I can handle tough...
Get to work, then...
See you tonight at 8?
- I'll send you the address...
Okay... Of your house, right?
You wish...
Good morning...
Morning...
Slept well?
Hmm
I made breakfast for myself,
I hope you don't mind...
have made you some
But I didn't know
what you'd like.
You know nothing about me.
I got to know quite
a bit last night...
Passion isn't familiarity...
I'm blushing again...
Change of topic!
X read some of your poetry
It's beautiful.
Glad you liked them...
I don't get much
appreciation for my poetry...
were: so much angst
m your poems
Angst will always find angst...
Can I steal it for my music?
Careful...
I have an excellent lawyer...
He didn't even spare
my ex-husband!
Divorced!
Why so pleased?
Of course!
You're single...
Happily divorced...
and x have no regrets
raw and x are
very good fnervds
Every poetess should
marry at least once...
A happy marriage means
a good life...
an unhappy one means
good poem
By the way, I was kidding...
If you need my poetry...
Go ahead.
Thanks
...but what I need is you.
I don't want to be needed...
I want to be desired.
You're relentless...
Like a walking-talking Ghalib...
ma: am x supposed m Say'?
Your silence said
more than enough...
Don't worry...
I have no room for
a relationship in my life...
Not anymore
There's more than
one kind of relationship...
...but only if you're up for it.
What are the rules like?
Easily broken...
So you gel my poetry

Like the colour of your walls...

Ayan
Fantastic work, sir!
Sir? Really... Sir?!
Are you trying to
make me sound old?
By the way, he doesn't
call you ma'am does he?
- You think?!
- I don't know!
So you're the one...
who's keeping her up at night...
Why waste time on sleep?
Sleep is critical...
for he!'
Oh, now I definitely
won't let her sleep.
I can't see this...
Change of topic!
Besides, you've fulfilled
your dreams...
Your new work is very interesting.
Actually, fantastic!
Without a lover in his arms,
what else is a man to do...
- Do you guys rehearse these lines?
- No, totally natural!
Ah, natural...
People often shroud
their fear with words...
Our relationship
may have changed...
...but the fear remains.
Why mu  change
x may ask?
Maybe you should
be asking the person...
...whose nights are now yours...
People often falter...
...on the slippery slopes
of relationships...
Yeah
You could have shown
me a better way...
Let the one who is lost,
find his own way...
x hate you
A We no, a bl
Such hatred... so soon?
Give me a chance...
Hating you is
completely justified...
Because I still love Saba...
I gave your love a chance...
It's time for you to
give my friendship a chance.
Isn't that hard'?
- What?
To love someone...
who doesn't love you in return?
It's the most beautiful
feeling in the world...
- Doesn't it make you feel weak?
- Not at all.
There's nothing like
the power of unrequited love...
Unlike other bonds,
it isn't shared...
It's mine...
and mine alone.
For a love like this,
I don't need Saba to love her...
There's no better love than that...
"if you gamble in
the name of love..."
"Stake what you like...
what's to fear?"
"How wonderful if you win..."
"Even if you lose...
all is not lost."
Don't hang up!
?
?
Shit!
- Hello?
- Ayan!
Where the hell are you?!
I've been trying to call you forever!
- You blocked my number!
What did you think I'd do?
Walk you down the aisle?
M you marry mm
Yeah... I did.
Congratulations!
Now you're Mrs. DJ Ali!
Must be stuck on
him like headphones...
Ayan, stop your crap
before I hang up.
Hello!
You don't scare me!
Control yourself!
I have a girlfriend now.
She: really mu

Are you jealous?
- I think you're jealous.
No, dude...
I'm just really glad you called.
Pm so nappy'
I have to go back
to my dinner date now...
- Candlelit... Romantic!
Ayan, listen...
I really missed you.
X hate you
Okay...
But I missed you...
Bye
'This is Saba... My girlfriend.'
'WOW '
'What's she doing with you?!'
'She's gorgeous!'
'Yeah Way better than you'
- 'Like it's a competition!'
- 'Of course it is!'
'ls DJ Ali still handsome
or did my curses work?'
'My prayers WOrkedV
'Are you happy?'
'Yeah Pm happy'
'Feels like I'm finally
a part of Ali's life...'
'Our lives are wrapped in luggage...'
'And hotel rooms are home...'
'But it's nice.'
'There's the occasional
dark cloud...'
'But other than that,
the sun is always shining.'
'Fm really, really happy'
w hate you '
'I'm coming to Vienna!'
'What mans?'
Wm very busy '
'Meetings, appointments...'
'Shuddap! You're free!'
'Okay,  arm'
'Saba and I would
love to host you...'
'...but leave that DJ Ali behind.'
'He has a concert,
anyway... I'll be there!'
"Hi!
"Hi!
You're dying to wait
by the window...
Check if she called...
Walk around restlessly...
You're not fooling
anyone with this pose...
What? Me? Why?
I'm totally chill...
I'm cool!
Someone's at the door...
Go She? here
I-li!
Hi... Cold outside?
What are you doing?
Didn't bring any wine?
Flowers? Thorns? Nothing?
Should I have?
Saba
AhZeh
Welcome home...
- So Alizeh...
- So nice to meet you...
Heard so much about you...
All good things, I hope!
What 7
No... just... trying to
ease the tension!
Get a hold on yourself...
The 'tension' will disappear?
Come...
- You know how girls can be!
- Sexist remark...
- Not appreciated!
- Not at all!
Give our intelligence its due!
Wine?
Maybe later...
Ah, okay
But, Saba
Beauty like yours often
overshadows intelligence...
Ask those of us who
live off our personality...
Beauty fades, Alizeh...
But Death, himself,
can't kill personality...
Wow... So the poetry
really was yours!
I thought Ayan was just
copying it off the internet!
If it weren't for poetry...
...I'd have died a thousand
living deaths already...
Cheese?
Will I sound phony
if I praise you some more?
Not at all...
Please go ahead...
No judgments!
Pictures do you no justice...
You're even more
beautiful in person.
Oh, so those pictures
were to show you...
To make her jealous...
...but why waste
envy on the resentful?
Wow, Ayan
Saba, looks like you've
had an influence...
A We DH of M
A little to go...
Well, it's not envy...
But you can't sing
to a mute person...
...and expect them
not to feel inferior!
Speaking of singing...
This is my favourite song...
"O lover, don't ask me
to love like I did before..."
"O lover, don't ask me..."
To love like I did before.
Dinner?
Bream
Why didn't you bring Ali?
He had a concert 50
DJ Ali's super busy, you see...
Why do you keep calling him that?
Like it's an insult...
Not at all!
Who doesn't dream of making
people dance orl their fingertips?
Alizeh, may I ask
you something personal?
If you don't mind...
Sure
How did you not fall in love
with someone so charming?
Charming for you, maybe...
He was a mg baby
when x met mm
He cried orl the streets,
cried in my arms...
Really?!
Ayan... Is this a compliment
or a slight?
You've never cried in my arms...
How could I cry in your arms...
...when I'm so distracted by
my other feelings...
You got lucky, Ayan!
Saba's wonderful.
Anyway
- Thank you for dinner.
- Go to hell!
'Thank you for dinner'?!
You're soulless!
Don't you have any feelings?!
Not jealousy, not guilt...
- Nothing?!
- I feel everything, Ayan!
But you'd never
understand if I told you...
You'd just misconstrue it all!
You're a goddamn child!
You've got everything!
Goals, passion,
a relationship...
Why are you still so stubborn?!
Because  arm
I'm stubborn
because it's my heart!
What are you going
to do about it?!
Why can': you we me?
I do love you, Ayan...
Just not the Way
you Wm me m
Why?
I can't... Please...
- I don't want to be selfish, Ayan-
- Get lost.
N: over, Ayan
It's over.
Wed
Fm m you
...then to myself.
I lied that I don't
have place for love...
I'm falling in love
with you, Ayan...
And today, I finally understood
that you can never love me...
...the way you love Alizeh...
And SUN
I love you...
What do  do?
Saba, you've always known...
I can't do this, Ayan...
I've been down this road...
It's broken me once before...
Saba
Please don't try to
change my mind...
I'll give in...
If I give in...
I'll fall apart again...
We can't choose who
to fall in love with...
But We can choose
when m  away
Go, Ayan
Go...
Let me go...
Please
Please... let rne go...
I can't go on like this...
So x have m go' okay?
Okay?!
I have to go...
If I can't do it...
then you have to be
the stronger one
Okay?
» Okay?
» Okay
Thanks
Good Job on the mm
Thanks
Hey, Ayan!
Hey, Am
What's up' mam
- Avoiding me?
- Avoid... no...
Congratulations...
You sang really well...
Thanks
Looks like you're doing well...
Well, I couldn't be
Mohammad Rafi...
...but I've found some
love on the internet...
- All good, otherwise?
- Yeah, all good... Superb...
I'm finding this
formality really funny...
The truth is that I'd been
hoping to run into you...
So I could beat you up...
You have no idea how much
I wanted to beat you up, DJ Ali!
Nice...
Why'd you feel that way?
Because of how you rem
Your love was so strong that
mine couldn't live up to it.
What else have
I ever done...
Sang some songs...
and fell in love.
'
Not everyone can love
so faithfully...
How's Alizeh doing?
You're serious?
You don't know?
I don't know... what?
Congratulations, man...
She left me.
Maybe I couldn't love
her the way she wanted me to...
I haven't seen her in two years...
Even her parents
haven't heard from her.
Last I heard, she was in London,
but I don't have the details...
Why didn't she call you?
Everyone knows love is crooked...
But to find peace
in that crooked love...
...is a gift only few have.
- This?!'
'This is my happy place!'
And when there's nothing left...
they find SheKer
H'! that crookedness
'I come here when the
world gets too much...'
Crooked love.
'When I want to spend
time with myself...'
'Because this is the only
place on earth that knows...'
'...that love is crooked...'
'Crooked '
Ayan?!
L-li!
Where have you been?!
Where the hell were you?!
Where the hell were you?!
No one m a due
Where you are
Who are you?
Malaysian Airlines?
You think it'll make a
difference if you disappear?!
I've been lying here for
I'm frozen through!
This is the cone and
this is the ice cream!
Haven't eaten, haven't slept...
Not used the loo for any business!
What if you'd showed up?!
- Where the hell were you?!
- Slap you!
Why'd you shave your head?!
Why are you new
I'm dying, you idiot!
Means?
At least give me a hug!
Dying means what?
What do you mean dying?!
Love is like cancer.
Comes without warning...
...and destroys you in its wake.
This can't be happening, Alizeh...
Well. .. It's happened.
I thought I was so cool...
Love turned me
into such a loser.
Ali was making me act insane...
From checking his phone,
to following him around...
- I'd stopped being his wife
to act like a parole officer.
I can't even really complain...
I was even willing
to overlook the cheating...
Thankfully...
I finally gathered the
last shreds of my dignity...
Wand left him.
- I decided that my husband does
not control my self-worth.
All that anger, hatred,
balled up in my throat...
I dismissed it as an
effect of the circumstance...
The doctors called it cancer.
- Straight to 4th stage!
I never even scored
that high in school, man!
But look at you!
You've gone from just
Ayan Sanger to Mr. Ayan Singer!
If you even think of dying...
I'll kill you.
Now that you're here...
I don't ever want to die.
So, ma: Wm you have?
Hi... Just some muesli
with strawberries, please.
- Muesli with strawberries...
And how about you?
Same!
» Okay
Oh, nothing...
Just donated my hair online...
BMW 00m?
May this bald head shower
you with blessings...
Cool.
Seriously?
You call that a reaction?
So low-key?
Alizeh, I just donated my hair...
And you're giving me an lrfan Khan stare?
A little over-the-top won't hurt!
Ayan, have you gone nuts?
Take a look at yourself!
You look hot, man!
Hon
You'll be fighting girls off...
We'll have to call security!
Seriously?!
- Really?!
- Yeah!
- Should I come there to try my luck?
- Come on over!
You're mad!
Goodbye, hairbrush!
Now, listen...
I have no real religion...
But I only believe in one religion.
R.D. Burmarrs music!
If we both look like Captain Pioard anyway...
let the Starship Enterprise fly!
Were young, were free
and were ready
...to let the freak flag fly...
...with Jolly Good Bollywood!
Your tea, madam!
Careful, it's hot!
bum you?
A me
"Hi!
Ayan
Actually, sorry but I'm not sorry.
What do you Wm from me?
What do  do?
You think I'm dying
to sleep with you...
I'm dying for you to love me...
I've tried everything...
Staying away, staying close,
another relationship...
But I can't...
I can't get you out of my head!
What does DJ Ali have that I don't?
If I get some tattoos
and start spouting poetry...
Will you love me then?
Will I finally be worthy of your love?
Because W do M
can do M
I'm talking to you.
Yeah, run away
Not like you have anything to say...
AhZeh
- I can break things, too!
- That's a pressure cooker!
Let M burst them
What do you want me to do?!
- Lie to you?
- Yes, lie to me!
- I can't lie!
- Why not?! You're dying, anyway!
Live or die, I will not lie to you!
This is the only honest thing
in my life, Ayan!
Can't you love me
instead of DJ Ali?
This IS love, Ayan...
- This isn't love.
- This IS love for me, Ayan!
Ayan, this is bigger than love...
This is the greatest love of my life.
I don't want this kind of love.
You're my friend...
My
My everything!
You're just not my lover.
Why not?
I can be your lover, too!
That kind of love has only destroyed me...
Do you want to be destroyed?!
Yes, I do.
I want to be destroyed.
This thing we have between us...
Our friendship...
n: my greatest strength
Love is my weakness...
Why don't you understand that?
Because a man and a woman
cannot be just friends!
Go...
Gel out of here
Go.
I can't explain this to you anymore...
If you can't understand, just leave...
Take your stuff and get out!
Get out!
Get out, Ayan!
AhZeh
It's a strange story...
of Love and Friendship.
Love, the hero...
and Friendship, the heroine.
The awful thing is that
Love never understood Friendship.
'I do love you, Ayan...
Just not the way you want me to.'
- 'Love is passion...'
- '...but friendship is peace.'
One night, tired and weary,
Love threw a tantrum...
Like a spoilt child... Stupid!
And what did Friendship do?
AhZeh
Friendship threw a tantrum, too,
and left in a huff.
And where else do heroines go?
The airport.
- 'Ayah... I'm going back home...'
And Love freaked out
- 'I hope one clay you'll
understand my love...'
When Love realised that Friendship
is leaving him forever... He ran.
And how he ram
H'! tam
Heathrow Airport!
H'! trans
He ram
He didn't stop to breathe...
Because Love knew...
Friendship was about to breathe her last...
And he wanted to be with
her 'til her last moments.
That was Love's right.
I need to get to BA 109!
I'm sorry, the gate closed
Has the flight taken off'?
N: about  gm

You can't die...
Mdam, keep that oxygen mask on
Alizeh, listen to him...
Put it back.
Ayan
I'm acting, I'm not really dying...
Don't react... We'll get caught.
How else do you runaway
from a runway?
Cancers got m have some perks
You came to the airport, Ayan...
You fulfilled my dream!
Alizeh, I'm sorry for last night...
Friendship doesn't know
sorry/'s and thank you's...
I swear I'll never trouble
you about this again...
Because, Ayan
It's a lot like love!
I friend you.
I friend you, too.
I friend you for life...
I friend you, too,
for whatever life is left.
Come, now, sing something...
Anything you like... I'm sick!
Interview done?
Hey... can I sing something?
Done
