Team DrC
Do you know where this person is
at present? - Don't ask that, only
He will give an unexpected visit
That is his way of doing
Can't say when he will come
To contact is there any way?
No phone to call no address
to write letter, nothing is there
lf he comes here,
he will visit David's home
Only after touching there
he will go to any other place
Saying there are angels
on the attic of the church
During childhood
you had gone in search of it
My Rachael, it's not like that
These are some of the
astonishing sketches
Then the room l stay, that thief and
that person, are the characters in tale
Don't keep searching and

Your brother is calling

Otherwise will anyone in
the world do such a thing?
What is this?
What fellow? Are you
making people a fool?
Doctor, you don't get perplexed
Look, you don't talk, more
Hey Panikkar doctor he celebrated
his birthday in his own way!
You don't talk!
You can't be corrected!
Now, what is your problem?
Hasn't he died?
Or gave an ad that he
is dead, which is the issue?
Yes man, is my
wish to see him dead?
Don't make a scene
Sir, what is this? lf the elder
people start doing like this?
Come on sit
Leave me
Won't allow to booze

Simply creating issues
Pal!
Pal, have a drink
Yeah!
Pal, people coming to
know the death of mine -
- to feel and see that
curiosity l have put that ad
'A game with death'
its a real feeling!
l got so much thrilled, it was a
feeling as if l'm on a 'giant wheel'
lf we become a 'dead body' on
taking a census, will know who will come
But there some 'exclusive people'
which we may not know
'Certain unexpected people'
Kathrenamma, had
come from 'Venni Mala'
She was really sick
but she is a beautiful child
A small child, she is aged 83
She had come along
with younger son
Then there was 'Das' he is blind
The vision is inside, he
is a singer in the train
'The train Das'
Then came Chandran
All whacked me nicely
Look there is no place left on
this body without a whack!
lt is out of love, pal like
you all loves me a lot
Now you tell, upon dying can
we experience any of these?
For making you upset, what
should l give? Come on tell
Do you want to beat me again?
Go on beat
''My wife's home
is on a hill of moon''
''On visiting there, will serve
with coffee, black coffee''
Lot of people had come
All the people who came were
served with liquor and food -
- which he made, till morning it
was full of singing and enjoyment
Why, did you get scared?
So, you are staying in the place
where he stayed, aren't you?
Can't say from where and all
people come searching for him
Some people from
Belgium, some from Bangalore
Some people from some orphanage
On the previous day
few people had come to beat him
But forthe first time, a
girl comes searching for him
Okay then
Look, does he know that such an
insane person is searching on him?
Don't know
Team DrC

This is me
But its not me!

We came searching for him
Sorry!

That was on the previous
'Ambu' festival at night

''A Zion traveler who

''On high tides, one who is capable
of controlling the sea and the wind''
Hey Pathrose!

You pig!

What is it that you want?

You pig, leave me l want to go
To where?
You stupid, l want to shit!
Should tell that no?
Pathrose! You may shit

My knife
Why knife? To shit!
Water will do, no? Go fast

''Don't waste a single grain of rice
the proverb is twenty famine may befall''
''On the old proverbs
there is no false saying -''
''- better not to speak against it''
Once more
''Don't waste a single grain of rice
the proverb is twenty famine may befall''
Now mother, you sing
''Don't waste a single grain of rice''
Now our Annamma will sing
Come on sing
''Don't waste a single grain of rice''
Now l'm going to show a magic
What is this? - Dice

We will together go to church
Did you hear, Annamma?
Pathrose come
Are you going?
We'll go and come fast,
daughter you may sleep
Sir, stop the vehicle
Come on, stop
Sir, you take this
Thinking of daughter only came
to show the mermaid at night
And sir, don't show this kind of
filthy act to me, okay
Sir, if you want to do
that take a room in any lodge
Pathrose what's your problem? ls
it that child, sitting inside the car?.
Pathrose, that is our own child
Pathrose, you may also see
her as your own child
Sir, that is not possible,
sir you take this
Pathrose your daughter who is sick,
when she says she wants to see stars
What will Pathrose, do?
Won't you show the entire
stars spread on the sky?
This is also just like that
When this child told, she wants to
go to mid sea and wants to see mermaid
We should fulfil that wish no?
A small wish - My sir l have been
going to this sea for 16 years
So far l have not seen the mermaid
What if, if you see one today?
My sir, all this is just a feeling
Pathrose, everything is a feeling
What if, if you and me
are the feelings of someone?
Look here, a mermaid
who has come to the shore
What looks she has got
Come
This is Pathrose
This is Queen Mary
Stop kidding sir
My name is Mariyam
Only this sir calls me Queen Marry
My name is Mathai
Sir, check the salt
Why salt? My dear salt, when
we are in the middle of salt
By the way, why one wish that
you want to see the sea at night?
That is all simply created by this sir
One dialogue to me, if
someone had shown herthe sea
Can l stay still hearing that?
That is why took her at night
Pathrose, pour one
she is very shy person
Team DrC
My goodness, look sir!
Mermaid!
That is the shape of the deity
who come to watch the sea
Christ!
That will roam in the sea
Christ is telling to the sea, to protect
the people in the sea and in the shore
Then will also tell to
the fish, to enter inside the net
Only if the Christ says,
only then will the sea listen
Sir, who is this lady? - She
is 'Mariyam' of 'Madalena'
So, sir are you the Christ?
Pathrose, what is the time?
As per the calculation it
must be 12 O'clock - Exactly
Exactly
Are you sure? - Sure
Then take the knife
Come, come fast
Queen Marry, Mary Kutty
Get up
Pathrose, take that knife
Hold this knife
Hold the knife
'Dear one, live like a
tide which is tireless'
'Have the longevity like the sea'
Now, you cut the cake

Shahina, why don't we wind up?
Take the wide of that and close
Why did you go to Kani's house?
lts not a spy work, lot of media
people had visited that home
That is because..To get
the balance of that story
One story and a person
who is never met at all
What is there in it?
To excite you
On that there are only
things which excite me
''Beautiful girl..''
''Beautiful girl..''
Team DrC
''Hey girl, did you see?''
''Searching for a person''
''Beautiful girl..''
''Beautiful girl..''
Stop the vehicle
''The heart is withering''

''Without winking the eyes,

Team DrC
Kani chechi  one person
has come to meet you, honestly
We quit, one person
has come to meet you
You may go and play, okay
Come on girl
We'll go there and play
l couldn't recognise you
l had gone home
Are you from the media?
An incident had happened without
the knowledge of media people, no?
ln Kani's life?
On the previous new year day
ln this story it is not mentioned
what happened next on that night
Kani, that Zaban and 3
other people had scolded Usman
Regarding the Thanya's matter
To call and say all this matter to
him, he is in search of some Ruby
He comes and leaves as
he wishes, let him come here
Anyway don't leave
Thanya to play outside
Who is this one?
Okay yeah recognised
Friend is it?
l knew it
l'm Kunjappan, so for
two days won't you be here?
Should be here, that is the rule here
Playing and all is good, but
kids don't go outside, okay
We won't go
Good, kids should be like that
ln search of this balance of
this story, coming this far?
Not the story, l came in search
of the person who wrote this story
What is this? Today also its
the same wheat gruel
Today its the wheat gruel,
tomorrow its the milk gruel
Today also same old wheat gruel
How is wheat gruel?
Since abandoned by children
that is why staying here, is it?
Then what is wrong if you
could prepare some tasty food?
My Sudhakara, tomorrow you'll
be fed with beef, is that okay?
Then what?
On seeing one plate of beef,
his heart will stop working
By the way, daughter do you cook?
Nope - What a pity? When
will you learn all this?
Should prepare some good
food and serve to groom -
- only then the things
will become strong
That is the psychology of that matter
l'm not married
Really?
Same pitch, l'm also not married
While saying not married, you must
have selected the groom, is it?
Where is he? ls he in army?
Kunjappo!
While serving us with wheat gruel,
you are having soup overthere, no?
Go man, go!
This is my own child - lf he
had married at the right time
He could have got an own
child like this, haven't he?
For that l was in army, wasn't l?
Didn't get the time to marry
Then what? Were you
'firing' daily over there?
Just don't con man
Go man
Daughter, this Kunjappan chettan
was in love with a Mariamma
Stupid! lf you change the
name and say l'll shoot you
lts not Mariamma, it is Thresia
Chakupurakal Thresia
Okay if it is Thresia, fine
with Thresia
Look, my house was
near the river shore
So, the Thresia's house
was on the other shore
Okay carry on, come on tell
On a rainy day Kunjappan
chettan was drenched in love!
Hey fellow Chakko, while telling to
say a thing, is it how you tell that?
Child, the thing is
this rain is love, isn't it?
And the rain is love isn't it?
This rained in cats and dogs!
Now, someone may tell the rest
Now, what is there to say? Afterthe
rain when he swimmed to other shore
There is no trace of Thresia at all!
lt was completely drenched in water
lt was a severe rain which was
not in accordance with the time
Thinking that when it gets over
will go and reveal the love
On reaching the other shore,
Thresia's home was washed off by water
They left the native by picking
up the rags which was left behind
No one knew to
where they had gone
At that time, l was
only aged 16 or 1 7
l searched a lot, then came
the commitments of life
Had joined the army, it
went on and on like that!
Reached so far
To say 'l love you to Thresia'
still now remaining unmarried
Yeah, fellow l'll remain
unmarried, l'll remain!
lf there is yet another birth, at
that time also l'll stand like that
That is the kick of love!
Haven't you seen so far? -While
coming for each and every leave
Will search here and there
Where to get?
Then l'll return
Hey fellow, love is a opium
which entices humans
That is what is told
by one and only Karl Marx
No one over here
will understand all that
But you have understood it, isn't it?
See, there is a pain in waiting
That is a pleasure
lsn't it?
My goodness!
Come have the gruel
Hello
Hello
Yeah, l can hear
Come on tell
Girl, l can't hear what you are saying
Right from morning l was calling
Your mother and Georji
had come to meet me
And then?
Hello
Hello, they had asked
me where you are
Hello
Hello
Over here the range
of the phone is less
Team DrC
Tessa, tomorrow morning
we have to go to a place
l'll come now
Team DrC
Let me check
There is no problem at all
Hey fellow don't play on
the bike go, l say
How long have you
started to ride the bike?
Used to go to college on this
This was Pappaji's vehicle
On that night, where did
you go with the bike?
Kunjappan chettan used to say,
he enters into each person's life
Unexpectedly
Stop the vehicle
Hello
Stop, stop the vehicle
Stop
Hey stop the vehicle
Stop the vehicle
What a speeding is this?
Since he mocked at you, do
you want to speed up like this?
Had a booze that is why,
anyway brothers you may go
Look, l came to say a sorry
l know it is not right to stop a person
from dying without his permission -
- to stop from dying
Because of that, l'm sorry
Now you may go
When you kick with love,
only then it will get started
Look this hanging and jumping in
the sea, that is all old fashioned
Why don't we try something new?
Pal, what a kick it was?
The kidney went up to the brain
now should massage it down!
Look
Have you heard one who was -
- struck by thunder
bolt was bitten by snake?
Most probably that's
going to happen now
Why don't we slowly
push off in 'reverse gear?'
l don't know to fight with these five
men and walk in slow motion
Come, don't stand here
Come
Look we went wrong with the route
how to go to Kanjiramattom?
That you go straight and turn left
Okay then
Okay
Great
Are you going?
Don't leave a matured
male alone and go like that
Go straight from here
and drop me at the other side
Foot rest?
lt is very near
lts only about 150 kilometres!
Vattavada!
Okay then
My god!
Have you seen the hunter?.
The Orion
Anyway you are going to
die, aren't you? Just watch that
lt is nice
Come on simply watch
Team DrC
Have you seen
snow falling on the hills?
Have you seen magic mushroom?
Without seeing any of these what to
do when you urgently go there?
On reaching there, he'll ask have
you come here, seeing all that?
'HE' has made all
this for us to watch
Simply see all that and
you may go happily
l don't know who you are, what
you are and what is your past
Why you tried to
suicide, l don't know all that
Go man, go
Look, new year is over no?
Don't just roam around, go home
Then shall we push off?.
Hello!
Sir, this is ourfirst new year
Okay go, go
Come on pop in
A person who has decided to die

Come!
Okay go, go

confusion who will ride the bike
Yeah, come on pop in,

- won't be good when riding the
bike through the high range
Get on it!

Good
Bye
Over here no one has
asked about my past
l had a relationship
That person has been
studying with me
One day he came and told he has
got FRCS and wants to go to London
Told to end this relationship
We shouldn't dishearten
a person who is careerist
By saying all the best and
all, had send him happily
But l was totally depressed
On that day, it was an independent
operation doing for first time in my life
The mind got swayed
A child who was only
That was a big news
on TV and newspaper
During that time,
l was 2 months pregnant
ln that depression, that one also..!
No matter how much we plan,
the fate of life is beyond that
On that day, that person
returned to me not only a new life
''My wife's home is
on the hill of moon''
''My wife's home is
on the hill of moon''
''On visiting there, will serve
with coffee, black coffee''
''My wife's home is
on the hill of moon''
So are you going
by packing everything?
So, has Kunjappan started
to set terms?
Comes and goes as he pleases,
that is your kind of terms, no?
Don't make me talk more
Tighten it well, otherwise all the
nibbles will be spilled inside the bag
Team DrC
Madam coffee
lts a coffee made ofjaggery, have it
You'll be fine
How is the sleep and all?
Aren't you happy? lt is some
dried fish and smashed meat
l have got some
lts forthem
Then l'm taking leave, will just
roam around 'Kambam and Theni'
Will straight away head
to 'Ambasamudram'
By the way, what is doctor's plan?
When you wish to leave, put the
vehicle in neutral and descend the hill
My goodness, are you leaving?
Can't you stay for one or two days?
Then what? Find some other person
to eat Tapioca in a high range
With some old guys
Buddy, l'm different buddy
Good, if you want to go-
- again if you come here
saying wants to eat Tapioca
Look, man Kunjappa, don't mess up!
l'll find that Thresia and
marry you off
Her husband and kids and
grandchildren will come climbing the hill
Then there won't be
Kunjappan to put the wreath
That is your..!
Go man!
That is bad words, since doctor is
standing here he is muting it and saying
He is playing with me
Okay then
One minute
From here to the nearest government
hospital, it'll take minimum 3 hours
lf you can, doctor stay
here forfew days
Try to experience this space
Sometimes this trick called life,
may get some new dimensions
Come on don't stand
like this, take a deep breath
Look, like this
Come on take it, you don't
have to invest money for that
Simply take it
Team DrC
After going on that
day when did he return?
One night he had come and
dropped Thanya and left
Then one ortwo phone calls
But over here, everyone
misses him a lot
Tessa came all this way to here, on
searching him, who is not met once
Team DrC
What is seen is here is only there
l'm a bachelor
Then one of my naughty friend is
there we both had set up this place
A shelterfor those
people who has got no one
Will go?
Why are you going all of a sudden?
lts a climate better
than Ooty, just tell all that
Can leave after two days
Must go!
There is a function at
home next week
Mummy you may go
down, we'll come now
This place is his, isn't it?
As per your character -

you came searching for him
On coming 27th it is my wedding
Perhaps in our family you
are the last one to know this
Hey girl, is it a big fault that l wish
for my wedding you should be present?
Yeah, Paulosachaya, what is said?
lf there is any discomfort
we'll shift to another hospital
Grandma is hospitalised
What happened?
On the previous day there was a
quarrel between Mummy and grandma

small variation on the BP
Who is there at the hospital?
Hello Mummy
Haven't you started?

You are telling you'll make
them run and you are running now
Hey angel who resides
on the hill top
Are you fine?
This is Kani, it is
not restricted 'Kani'
lt is an original 'Kani'. Can
shake hand with her without fear
Please come
Going to pray by placing the hand
on all 'Satan's' head, over here
All these years had lived without
any church or clergy people
My dear Kujapoo, speak low, they
will hear - Telling, so that they can hear
He comes in, once in a while and
he thinks he can do any nonsense
Why has he come with everyone?
ls it to do the 'last rituals' for me?
My Kunjapa, they have
come to pray - To pray..!
l haven't delegated
anyone, to pray for me
Then why is he..?
''Hey Saviour, You are the kindness''
''Pardon the sins,
You are the divine grace''
''On the deserted desert, you
became the water of life''
''These people who are thirsty
always be with them''
Mr. Kunjapps!
Are you sitting here?
Kunjappa!
Kunjappa!
When a person comes to meet,
are you sitting with face turned away?
This is sister Theraiz Mary
Forthe last 30 years
settled at Seashells
The house was at Kavalam
The name called at home is Thresia
Chakuparakal Thresia
Team DrC
Maruthu, is the tea ready to serve
them? What is there for nibble?
Good Tapioca is there
That's great
Chakocha, come
What is it son?
Come, come fast
Come
What is it? -Come fast
Tell the matter
Come, come
Do you know who is standing there?
Which one?
Who is it?
That old love of Kunjappan is there
no? That was washed off in the flood
That is the one
My goodness!
The one and only
Chakupurakal Thresia
Chakupurakal Thresia!
My heavens!
My Christ how difficult was it
to bring the sisters to this place?
These sisters come for
two weeks visit after 5 or 6 years
When the main father told,
can't take them like that
l just fell on those feet
Take that Tapioca, while traveling
through Kudamaloor, Kurishumala
On deviating there is a place
where lot of old people live
Just come and pray for them, l
begged and told in the lying posture
Otherwise, can l
say among these sisters?
Can l say there is an old Thresia
present who is loved by our Kujappan?
lmmediately if they hearthat won't
they hook me on the cross?
Sister Gulothi, you
have got diabetics
l hail from Manimala
On eating Tapioca, if it is to die
means let the death take place
Sister, if death comes, take it cool
Along with cross in the cemetery,
l'll place a few Tapioca also
Then what?
Team DrC
''On the 'Golgotha hills'
on the unending paths''
''With the foot steps engulfed
in grief, climbs the hill''
''Someone walks on the waves''
''Won't you render the
blessing, divine one?''
''You are the love''
But how did you manage to get her?
For few days l was after this,
anyway it was great, wasn't it? -Yeah
lf anyone is waiting for
someone, come on just tell
Kunjappa!
You naughty lover!
Closed the door and are you sitting
shyly? Come out, Kunjapoo!
Kunjapa, come out
Kunjap..!
Can l sit alone for some time?
Team DrC
Sir, you just tell what you want
Shall l built a 'tree house'
on that big tree?
Sir, just tell what to do
All that can be done after l come
Sir, when you go
when will you come back?
That is..Come on
Maruthu, have coffee
Kunjappan chettan, has not opened
the door so far, will it be a problem?
No problem at all, he'll be completely
in a romantic mood, over there
Let him sit there and
let him simply enjoy it
Maruthu, hold this one
What if, if the life ended without
seeing the person who is waited?
For that only, people like
us are living on this earth
So, if we wait for a person sincerely -
- some day that person
will come, won't he?
Then what?
Where else to go
Then why are you hiding like this?
People who hide away from one's
own matters, they chatter like this
By the way doctor, what is this? As
if prescription of some English medicine
Can't make out anything
Are you scared?
Why not? There is a fear whether
cow may come and poke!
There is a fear whether
coconut may fall on the head
Are you scared to love?
When a person says loves
you, how will you react to it?
Where to say?
Who is there to say?
Suppose if a person says like that
That is like..
Hey doctor
When we crash into others life
and when we give some surprises
That, glow in their
eyes is there, isn't it?
l just continue to live
on that fun and thrill
lf some one expects more from
me, that may end up in a problem
But it doesn't mean that l may end
up doctor in a problem, l'm sure
Forgot to give the medicine
to Kunjappan chettan - Kani!
You didn't say the matter
which you were about to say
Do you know Tessa?
Had come here
When?
Was here for two days
Didn't know you will come
today, left today morning only
Why is this, cat and mouse play?
Why do you want to
fool that girl, like this?
No
l'm not fooling anyone
Don't take that in a
simple manner like this
l know
Yeah, l know Tessa
Everything, searching for
me, staying in that room
From the stories that
is heard about me
l don't know what is the
image she has got about me
lf it were a negative image, that
girl won't come to this place -
- searching for you
My mother, l'm not there
to argue with doctor
My life is not disciplined and
systematically arranged
There is no plan in
particular, simply like this..
Team DrC
Still there is a possibility for all that
During the time of
fever, l have thought
lf l had a girl as a company
Can inflict the fever
to one more person
l'm not saying for an argument
The only concern is,
what you have shown on me
That is what l have towards Tessa
Go and sing that song
to your stupid father, fellows
Go
Kunjappo!
l should have send some coffee
powder and tea leaf to them
To whom?
They are going back tomorrow, no?
Shucks! On seeing, l was
perplexed, l couldn't say anything
Whatever she told,
l didn't hearthat also
By the way son -
- perhaps if my Thresia had known
such a person is searching for her
Maybe if some one had told that
We might have met long back
lsn't it?
lsn't it?
lsn't it?
Team DrC
Going!
When l say bye, then there
will be cries and sentiments
That will be a big messy
lf you don't mind, can
you drop me till that bus stop?
Tomorrow it is our 'Thrissur
Pooram'
Doctor, have you participated
in any of the 'Poorams?'
No
Should just see it what a beauty
This time there is no 'Pampadi
Rajan' other guy will be there
'Adiyattu Ayyappa' when stationed
in dark, can't see, so dark in colour
From there will
head to 'Kunnamkulam'
Should take the bullet
of lttikora Pappan
With that bike, heads to 'Katmandu'
through 'Goa, Gokarnam'
Some of my friends homes
are lost, should help them also
From there will travel to North East
Forjust 3 months - so, not
planning to meet that girl, no?
Here comes again! l thought after
a sleep you'll forget everything
For you everything is a
child's play, no? Orjust a fun
Never at all
Doctor my father has demanded
only one thing during all these years
That was to meet that girl - Then
why can't you fulfil father's wish?
Not that, how can l
simply meet that girl?
While seeing a girl, who has
searched me so long
There should be some variety, no?
Only while meeting
like that, it will turn colourful
There is a person!
Okay right!
Take care of our Kunjappan, my
fear is will he join any Seminary?
At this age
Look, let me tell one matter
which is serious, not playful
Tell Tessa, to come if she has not
seen 'Pooram'
l'll be there in the mist of crowd
Let her find me, if she can
l know, it is not an easy
task to find a person from there
But there is no other way
''Beautiful girl..''
''Beautiful girl..''
''Hey girl, did you see?''
''Searching for a person''
''The heart is withering''
''Setting fire on the nerves''
''Without winking the eyes,
who is this girl searching for?''
''Beautiful girl..''
By risking the own life,
by knotting the hands and legs
lnside this box
Pay attention
From this box, a person who
has knotted his hands and legs
Within seconds he'll come out
This is my last item
Come fast
Team DrC
Wasn't it colourful?
Coming forfirst time to 'Pooram', no?
Hey Thiru, ready, come
packing everything
He is my tutor
The great magician
Not seen her before
l'm also seeing forfirst time
This is Tessa
Daughter, your
government stopped arrack
Stopped the bar
Do you have anything with you?
Okay, l'll pack everything and come
Okay go and come
Why don't we have
a hot, cold lime juice?
Team DrC
l'm Sruthi
Sruthi Raman
Where you expecting anyone else?
When will the festival begin?
What?
When will the festival begin?
Will start now
Where is Tessa's house?
That you said
l don't know where your Tessa's
house is, my house is at Pondi
Pondicherry
Who is this Tessa?
Did she dump you?
And ran?
That is a 'Genie' which is not seen
With an image which was in my
mind, just made a blind attempt
l thought you are that girl
When l ask you a serious
question, would you lie?
Actually, you are the Tessa, no?
Come fast, the festival
is about to begin
Yeah, coming
Now what is the next plan?
Alone?
Will we meet again?
lf at all seen, will we remember?
Who knows
So, why don't we
take a great photo?
Team DrC
Sruthi!
The festival!
Tessa!
Charlie!
