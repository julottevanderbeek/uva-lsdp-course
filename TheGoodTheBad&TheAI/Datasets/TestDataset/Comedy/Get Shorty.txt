It's fuckin' cold outside.
The guy on the radio said
it's gonna get down to 34.
It's 34.
That's freezing, for Christ sakes.
Yo, Chili!
What, you spacing?
They're closing down the Granville.
You know, that theater on Biscayne?
That guy owes Momo a couple G's.
I know. I was thinkin'
maybe Momo should buy it.
I could run it for him,
show some old Cagney movies.
What's Momo gonna want
with some broken-down theater
that shows movies
nobody wants to see anymore?
Outside of maybe turning it
Into some kind of porno house,
he's not gonna give much of a fuck.
- I'm gonna go talk to this Chili.
- Besides, you already got a job.
Yeah... yeah.
- Hey, Ray! How you doing?
- Yeah, good. You?
Okay. Can you
believe this weather?
Miami Beach, for Christ sakes.
Chili Palmer.
It's chilly outside,
and it's Chili inside.
It's a regular fuckin' Chili-fest!
How you doing, Ray?
Obviously much better
than you, Chili.
That was a good one.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, when you're done
staring out the window,
I'll meet you back at the office.
Hey! Where's my coat?
It's not one of these?
Do you see a black
leather jacket, fingertip length,
like the one
Pacino wore in Serpico?
- 'Cause if you don't, you owe me $379.
- Maybe you didn't see the sign.
I seen the sign,
but I didn't come to sunny Florida
to freeze my ass off, you got that?
So you either find my coat,
or you give me the $379
that my ex-wife paid for it
at Alexander's.
Wait a minute.
Ray Bones took my coat?
No, no, he didn't take it.
He borrowed it, 'cause, see,
somebody took his coat.
So Mr. Barboni try this other coat,
and it fit him pretty good.
That was my coat.
He was wearing it to go home,
but he's not gonna keep it.
My car keys are in that coat.
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.
You know,
he works for Jimmy Capp.
I know who he works for.
Where's your phone?
This way.
Are you sure it was Ray Bones
that took the coat?
That's what the man said.
Tomorrow I see on the TV weather
it's gonna be nice and warm.
- You don't need the coat.
- This is it.
Get the coat.
Just don't piss the guy off, okay?
Then we're gonna have to call Momo
and straighten the whole thing out,
and Momo's gonna be pissed off
for wasting his time.
We don't need that.
Don't worry. I'm not gonna say
any more than I have to, if that.
It's freezing.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just a minute.
What are you, fuckin' nuts?
My nose! My nose!
Holy shit!
Somebody call 9-fuckin'-111!
Somebody call 9-fuckin'-111!
What do you want me to do, Ray,
go to war over a fucking coat?
You're lucky the guy didn't kill you.
The coat was a Christmas present,
for Christ sakes.
Now, listen to me, Jimmy.
You gotta do something
about this guy. He's running amok.
And he's got no fuckin' respect
for none of us.
He's got no respect for you.
And I don't gotta do shit!
Chili Palmer don't work for me.
He works for Momo up in Brooklyn,
so as long as Momo's around,
nothing happens to Chili Palmer.
Do you understand?
Over here.
We're here, Momo.
I hope you guys
checked this place out good,
'cause I'm goin' in there alone,
and I don't want no fuckin' surprises.
Oh, yeah. I checked
everything, Momo.
Yeah, who is it?
- It's Momo.
- Get in here.
Surprise!
What are you tryin' to say...
you're never gonna sleep again?
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed.
There's a difference.
This article says that most people
die in their beds.
I figure as long as
I stay out of bed, I'm safe.
What? That's the dumbest thing
I ever heard of.
Where you gonna sleep?
In my recliner.
You know, the tan one
in the TV room.
Or I'll go to the coffee shop,
slide into a booth, pull my hat down.
Hey, how many people you know
died in a coffee shop?
Cut straight hair in here
or just fags?
Hey, Bones. That's quite a scar
you got on your head.
Why don't you have
these guys fit you for a rug,
cover it up for you?
You two geezers
take your game to the park.
This man is the man.
You understand what I'm sayin',
motherfucker?
He's Mr. Bones, and you speak
to Mr. Bones from now on.
Come on. You can do better
than him, can't you?
Not these days.
Not unless you speak Spanish.
You got a miss.
Leo Devoe... he's six weeks over.
He's dead.
How do you know he's dead?
Did he tell you?
Yeah, he told me
that he was dead.
Personally?
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me
that he got killed
in that Getaway jet crash
that happened a month ago.
Maybe he took out
some flight insurance.
Go check with his wife.
You check it out.
It's your book now.
He owns some dry cleaning store
over on Federal Highway.
Let me explain
something to you.
Momo is dead, which means
that everything he had
now belongs to Jimmy Capp,
including you,
which also means that when I speak,
I speak for Jimmy...
e.g., from now on,
you start showing me
the proper fucking respect.
"E.g." means "for example."
What I think you want to say is "i.e."
Bullshit, it's short for ergo.
Ask your man.
To the best of my knowledge,
"e.g." means "for example."
E.g., i.e., fuck you.
The point is this...
when I say, "Jump,"
you say, "Okay," okay?
Yeah, Ray. Okay.
Now, you owe me
the dry cleaner's 15 G's,
plus the juice,
which is another...
You either get it from his wife
or outta your own pocket.
I don't give a fuck,
but you never hand me
a book with a miss.
We'll see you, Ray.
Go see the dry cleaner's wife.
You got three days.
I told you not to piss him off
that time. You remember...
Don't say another fuckin' word,
all right?
I hate the dry cleaning business.
I hate being inside all day
around all those machines.
Must be hot.
You have no idea
how hot it is.
You know, Fay, I was...
I was wondering...
did Leo have life insurance?
I don't know of any.
I trust you, Chili.
I think you're a decent type of man,
even if you are a crook.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, Fay.
I wish he really was dead.
He's a son of a bitch.
Yeah, that's him, all right.
Called himself Larry DeMille.
Hit on every showgirl in town.
He told me he was
the Martinizing king of Miami.
What a moron.
Anyway, you want this guy,
he's in L.A.
We put him on a plane after he
spanked one of my cocktail girls.
- Leo spanked a cocktail girl?
- Apparently, the way it went...
...he invites her to Santa Anita
to play the ponies with him.
She tells him
what he can do with that.
He gives her one on the tush.
My guess... he's by his lonesome
at the track right now.
Hey, Chill, if you decide
to go to L.A.,
this guy owes us 150 grand.
Some movie producer.
Movie producer? Really?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Why not?
Appreciate that, man.
You're gonna love this guy.
Another fuckin' moron.
Harry Zimm.
All right. Thanks a bunch.
- Where is it?
- It's right there.
Well, what is that?
- It's an Oldsmobile Silhouette.
- I ordered a Cadillac.
Oh, well, yeah,
that's the Cadillac of minivans.
Are you kidding me?
Hey, you want, La Tijera
Car Rental is right over there,
but I think all they got
Is Rabbit convertibles.
Guess I'll take
the Cadillac of minivans.
Harry!
Harry, goddamn it, wake up!
Wake up.
Somebody's downstairs.
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's downstairs.
Be quiet. Listen!
- I don't hear anything.
- Right there.
It's the television.
When I came upstairs, you stayed
downstairs to finish your drink.
I told you to turn off
the television when you were through.
I also told you
you could sleep in the maid's room.
Yeah, well, I did that.
I turned the television off
with the remote thing,
then I laid it on the floor.
You know what could've happened?
The dog came in, stepped on it
and turned the television back on.
I don't have a dog, Harry.
You don't?
What happened to Muffy?
Harry, are you gonna go down there
or do you want me to do it?
No, I'm going.
Hurry!
Anybody skimmin' the pool?
It needs it.
I'm goin', I'm goin'.
I've gotta go to the bathroom.
All right, I'm going.
I'm going.
Jesus.
Do you have
one of those satellite dishes?
Now, where I live... how many channels
do you get of television?
Are you on
the information superhighway?
Where I live... and I get all of
the premium services on my cable...
2,800 channels?
No kidding.
- If I wanted, I could...
- Harry Zimm.
Jesus Christ!
How you doing?
I'm Chili Palmer.
Jesus! If I have a heart attack,
I hope you know what to do.
Where you been, Harry?
Have we met? I don't recall.
We just did.
I told you,
my name's Chili Palmer.
You're in pictures, right?
Did you ever stop to think what would
happen if I had a heart attack?
- Look at me, Harry.
- I'm looking at you.
I want you to keep
looking at me, right here.
Well, that's what I'm doin'.
You know Dick Allen?
Mesa's Casino?
That's what this is.
You're a collector
for the fucking casino.
You come in here
in the middle of the night.
I thought you were an actor
auditioning, for Christ sakes.
We'll see about this.
Operator, let me have
Las Vegas information.
Harry, let me give you some advice.
You don't want to act
like a hard-on,
you're standing there
in your undies.
What you want to do
is sit down and talk to me.
- Harry, a marker is like a check.
- I know what a marker is.
They don't want to deposit yours
and have it bounce.
That annoys them.
And your dear friend
Dick Allen's been calling you,
leaving messages on your machine,
and you haven't gotten back to him,
so he asked me, as a favor,
to look you up.
I follow you here, and I see you
in a window with a woman,
looks a lot like Karen Flores,
the actress from Grotesque.
You're not looking at me, Harry.
Why do I have to keep
looking at you?
Because I want you to.
So now you're gonna get rough, huh?
I make good by tomorrow,
or you're gonna break my legs?
Come on, Harry. Mesa's?
Tell Dick Allen I'll cover those markers
in the next 60 days at the most.
If he doesn't like it, then that's
his problem, the fucking prick.
So, you want me to call you a cab?
So you make movies, huh?
I produce feature motion pictures.
No TV.
That happens to be Grotesque, Part II
that Karen Flores was in.
She also starred in three of my
Slime Creatures releases.
You may have seen them.
I got an idea for a movie.
Yeah, what
did this guy look like?
You can't imagine
what a pathetic little guy!
Is he one of these with
the Bermuda shorts and the black socks?
No, no. Wait for this. Okay.
Leo, right? He would wear,
like, plaid wool hats
in Miami
in the middle of the summer.
He doesn't want anyone
to think that he's bald, right,
so he'd be wearing a fuckin' cap!
Say hello to Chili Palmer.
Chili, this is Karen Flores.
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Karen.
How'd you get in the house?
He's just telling me
an idea for a movie.
It's not bad so far.
Sit down, have a drink.
Tell Karen.
See what she thinks.
- Maybe you didn't hear me.
- I came in the back door.
You broke in?
Well, it was open.
Wasn't locked.
Well, what if it were?
You want to hear this idea?
It's about this dry cleaner
that scams the airline
out of 300 grand. Tell her.
It's simple. It's basically about a guy
who owes a shylock $15,000,
and he's about three weeks
over on the vig.
- That's the interest you have to pay.
- I know what vig is.
Anyway, this dry cleaner...
let's call him Leo, all right?
He's scared.
He doesn't know any better.
He leaves town.
So Leo gets on the plane, but the plane
sits there... it doesn't move.
They announce over the PA system
there's some kind of mechanical problem.
"But keep your seats
in case they get it fixed sooner."
So the guy's nervous
and in no shape just to sit there,
sweat it out,
so he gets off the plane,
he goes into the cocktail lounge,
and he starts throwing them down,
one after another.
As a matter of fact,
he's still in the lounge
When the guy finds out
it was his flight, he can't believe it.
If he had stayed on the plane,
he'd be dead.
Right now, he knows
his luck has changed.
If everybody thinks he's dead,
he won't have to pay back the 15
or what he owes on the vig.
Keep going. Come on.
Since Leo's name
was on the passengers list,
they bring his wife out to the airport,
where they're going through
personal effects,
whatever wasn't burned up.
so the wife tells them what to look for...
things only she would know about.
Oh, my Leo! My Leo!
and the people from the airline
come out to see his wife.
They tell her how sorry they are
and all that their plane exploded,
the amount based on
what he would've earned
operating the dry cleaners
the rest of his life.
So how much is the wife offered?
You know, money in the hand, babe.
So he gets his wife
to cash the check,
and he takes off
for Vegas with the dough.
He gets there
and he's supposed to call her...
you know,
let her know when to come out.
She never hears from him again,
but he's hot.
He runs the 300 grand
up to half a million.
Then he comes back to L. A...
But it's driving the guy nuts
because he's winning
and he can't tell anybody
who he is.
So we show in a back story
his motivation, his desire to be famous.
He's got the dough to buy his way in...
mix with the celebs...
and he can't resist,
so then he comes to L.A.
I don't know about
the mixing with celebrities.
I mean, that's something new
that was just added.
But yeah, he comes to L.A.,
and I don't know
what happens after that.
What? That's it?
That's your movie?
I said I had an idea for a movie.
That's half a movie with holes in it...
maybe 40 minutes of screen time.
You don't have a girl...
a female lead...
and on top of that, you don't have
anybody to sympathize with.
- You don't have a good guy.
- The shylock is the good guy.
The shylock is barely mentioned.
It's not believable that the wife
would get a settlement that fast.
Harry doesn't realize
it's a true story.
That Miami flight that went down was
on the news every day for about a week.
Harry must have been busy.
- That's where you got the idea?
- Part of it, yeah.
You're not the guy, are you...
the dry cleaner?
Leo.
You wouldn't be
talking to me if you were.
No, I'm not the guy, Harry.
But you do work for the casino?
Oh, for God's sakes, Harry!
He's the shylock.
That right?
That's what you do for a living?
That's what I did for a living
until recently.
But after I'm done here,
I don't know what I'm gonna do next.
Well, I got an early call.
No problemo, babe.
Go on up to bed.
What I'm saying, Harry,
is that I would like you
and your new buddy
to get out of my house.
Oh, yeah, well, sure.
It was absolutely
a pleasure to meet you, Karen.
I guess in your line of work,
there's times you have
to get kinda rough, huh?
You know, in case
one of your customers don't pay?
- They always pay.
- Yeah? You pack a gun?
Not really.
You ever been arrested?
Well, I've been picked up
for loan sharking and racketeering,
but never convicted, no.
I'm clean, Harry.
Racketeering.
That covers a lot of ground
doesn't it?
Get to the point, Harry.
You want me to do
something for you.
That's us.
Good girl.
Don't say nothing to me.
Just sit down
and act like you're waiting for
somebody that's supposed to meet you.
What the fuck you talkin' about?
Don't nobody know me here.
- Give me the fuckin' money.
- Sit down.
Now, be looking.
The man over to your right
in the blue wool shirt, hanging out...
The other way.
Derecho.
That's a federal officer...
most likely D.E.A.
He moves his leg,
you look for the bulge.
You savvy bulge?
Good.
That's his backup piece.
Hey, try it without looking
right at him if you can.
- What's your name?
- Yayo Portillo.
All right, Yayo, you know he's there.
Just forget about him.
I'm gonna get up. Soon as I'm gone,
you sit down in this same seat I'm in.
You'll feel something under your ass.
That's a key to a locker
where your half million is,
along with some product
we're returning.
Powder's been stepped on
so many times, it's baby food.
You're supposed to give me
the money yourself.
Try to be cool, Yahoo.
I told you where it is.
You do it just how I told you,
and you have a safe trip home.
What'd you have for breakfast, baby?
What'd you have for breakfast?
How come you weigh so much?
You have a burrito?
Give it to the nice lady.
There you go.
Sorry.
Getting chocolate all over you.
Say thank you. Bye-bye.
Hi.
Like fucking clockwork,
huh, Bear?
Hi, Bo.
Hey, Farrah. You ready to go
for a ride, sweetie?
Yeah.
Told you to watch your mouth
around my daughter.
The white zone is for
loading and unloading only.
These guys, my investors,
they run a limo service.
They came to me originally,
put some money
in a few of my pictures.
Did okay. They're happy.
This was back a few months ago
when I was planning
what would be my next picture,
about this band of killer circus freaks
that travel around the country
leaving bodies in their wake.
There's a 700-pound fat lady
has a way of seducing guys...
gets them in her trailer.
Harry, look at me.
You're trying to tell me
that you fucked up
without sounding stupid,
and that's hard to do.
Let's talk about where you're at, okay?
You blew 200 grand
of these limo guys' money
on a football game in Vegas,
and you didn't tell them. Now, why?
They don't seem like the type of guys
that would take it with
any understanding or restraint.
First thing they'd do
is break my legs.
You got that on the brain,
but if you were so scared, why did you
take it to Vegas to begin with?
I needed a half million dollars
to buy a script.
- A movie script?
- Blockbuster, but quality.
No mutants or maniacs.
This is gonna be my
Driving Miss Daisy.
Murray Saffrin, the guy that wrote it...
did all my Grotesque pictures...
had it in his drawer for 20 years.
He shows it to me one day,
and he says he's got a major star
interested, would I produce it?
Which star?
Two-time Academy-award
nominee Martin Weir.
That's Martin Weir.
He's the one that played
the mob guy turned snitch
in Cyclone.
One of his best parts.
His best part was
when he played the crippled gay guy
that climbed Mount Whitney.
Ride the Clouds.
Good picture.
That woman...
she looks familiar.
She's a rock star.
Every day, same time, they come
down here and have breakfast.
He faces west
so he can see his billboard.
She faces east
as an excuse to wear her shades.
Unbelievable.
Anyway, Murray has a shrink
who happens to be Martin's
personal trainer's shrink.
Murray gives the shrink the script.
The shrink gives it
to Martin's trainer,
who reads it to Martin
as they work out.
- Martin loves it. He flips.
- So, what's the problem?
The problem is Murray.
Heart attack.
Doris, Murray's widow,
she finds out about
this Martin Weir thing,
and because Murray and I
never had a written contract,
she wants half a million bucks
for the script.
You want me to put you
next to my dry cleaner
so he can invest in your movie.
That, or I was thinking,
what if some tragic accident
were to befall the widow Saffrin?
No, Harry,
I'm not gonna pop her, okay?
It was just a thought.
I tell you what I can do.
I can meet with these limo guys,
tell them to leave you alone for a while,
make the point in a way
they can understand.
You don't know these guys.
Believe me, I know them
a whole lot better than you do.
I once asked this literary agent
what kind of writing paid the best.
He said ransom notes.
Ransom notes.
"Lovejoy sits behind the wheel,
watching a bar across the street,
getting his video camera..."
What, is he following someone?
Read it. It's a grabber.
Harry, I think your investors are here.
- Oh, Jesus.
- All right, this is the plan.
I want the limo guys to sit
in these chairs, not on the couch.
You got that?
Yeah.
No. Keep the blinds open.
I want the light in their eyes.
I'm gonna sit at the desk.
I don't want you to introduce me.
Just start talking.
I want you to stand here behind them
as they sit down, you understand?
They'll be looking at you,
but they don't know who you are.
They'll be saying,
"Who is this guy?"
But you don't say anything.
Do not tell them who I am, okay?
- I gotta say something to them.
- No, you don't.
Don't say any more
than you have to,
unless you want
to say something like,
"Glad you assholes stopped by.
Now I can straighten you out."
You're kidding, right?
Just say the movie's
been postponed a year,
but don't tell them why.
Whatever you do, don't say anything
about Mr. Lovejoy, you got that?
All right. Let's go.
- Hey, Ronnie.
- Hey, Harry. Hi.
Wow!
What year is it, man?
We enter a time warp?
I feel like I'm in
Hollywood of yesteryear.
- Have a seat right there.
- Cool.
This is my associate
Chili Palmer.
He's gonna be working with me.
Just so there's no misunderstanding,
despite the rumors
you might have heard,
your investment in Freaks
is just as solid
as the day you signed
your participation agreement.
I can hear you, man,
but where the fuck are you?
Right here.
What I've been wondering is,
where's he been?
Yeah. Where you been, Harry?
We haven't heard from you lately.
New York. I was interviewing actors,
scouting locations.
is gonna be put off
for a couple of months.
- A couple of months?
- Yeah.
Just a couple of months.
We need more... prep.
Hey, Harry, bullshit, man.
We have an agreement with you.
No, no, we're gonna do this picture.
We are going to do this picture.
I just have another project to do first,
one I've promised this guy for years.
I want to see your books, Harry.
Just show me where it is...
a two with five zeros
after it in black and white.
I want to see your books, I want to
see your fuckin' bank statements...
Hey, Ronnie, look at me.
You have a piece of a movie,
that's all. Not a piece of Harry.
If he wants to do another movie
this year, that's how it's gonna be.
Excuse me, bro,
but who the fuck are you?
I'm the one telling you how it is.
Catlett.
What is this other movie
you're doing first, Harry?
- Let me show...
- Harry, let me answer this one.
First of all, who am I talking to...
am I talking to him
or am I talking to you?
You can talk to me.
That's what I thought.
Let me put it this way.
Outside of Freaks, it's none
of your fuckin' business what we do.
Oh! Here it is right here.
This is the project...
Mr. Lovejoy.
I don't want you guys to think that
I'm trying to put something over on you.
Mr. Loveboy...
what is it, Harry... a porno flick?
It's fluff.
You wouldn't be interested in it.
You think we go to see your movies?
I've seen better film on teeth.
It makes no difference to me
which one our money's in,
so how about you just take
our 20 points out of Freaks
and put 'em in this other one,
this Mr. Loverboy.
No. I can't do that.
You're positive about that?
Yeah. It's a different kind of deal.
It's... structured.
Okay.
Then be good enough
to hand us our money back,
or you think about us coming in
on this new deal.
You let us know.
By Friday, man, or you're fuckin'
dead as disco. You hear me?
Take your time, Harry.
We're not animals,
are we, Ronnie?
What?
What?
Maybe I wasn't clear,
but I thought I told you
to keep your mouth shut.
I had to tell them something.
Harry, never say anything
unless you have to.
You asked me to
get these guys off your back,
and the next thing I know, you're saying,
"Have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy."
I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
I told them that I would think about it.
In this town,
what does that mean? Nothing.
Well, that's the difference
between you and me, Harry.
I say what I mean.
If I want something from someone,
I ask them straight out.
If I want Martin Weir,
I go get Martin Weir.
I don't fuck around
with his trainer's shrink.
Shrink's trainer.
Take me back to my car.
- Yeah?
- Tommo, Chili.
Hey, where you been?
I been calling all over for you.
Ray Bones is looking for you.
Where the hell are you?
- I'm in L.A. Now.
- What are you doing out there?
I'm going into
the movie business.
What the fuck do you know
about making movies?
I don't think the producer
has to know much.
I think you're full of shit
or a chump.
I gotta go.
Call me when you know
more about Ray Bones.
Karen, how you doing?
What are you doing here?
Listen, I wanted to come by
and apologize for breaking in
the way I did last night.
Let me get this straight.
You broke in again to apologize
for breaking in before?
No, no.
Your patio door was open.
You shouldn't do that.
You got a lot of nice things in this house.
Well, make sure you lock it
on the way out.
You had a bad day, huh?
I spent all day
crawling out of a grave.
The director said I was incapable
of reaching the emotional core
of the character.
What?
Obviously, he didn't see you in
Bride of the Mutant.
You saw that one?
When you turn to the camera
and you say to the alien mother
that her time on Earth is finished,
Joan Crawford on her best day
wished that she had
had in her day,
the emotion, the intensity
that you had in that scene.
Well, that was a good scene...
I mean, for a horror movie.
No, for any movie.
I know I'm better than what
I've been doing all these years,
walking around in fuck-me pumps
and a tank top,
waiting till it was time to scream.
- Yeah, but what a scream.
- Yeah, it's a real gift.
Look, all I'm sayin' is, it would be
nice to get the chance
to say one great line,
like in that great Bette Davis movie
Cabin in the Cotton,
where she walks up to
the guy on the porch,
gives him a flirty look, and says,
"I'd kiss you, but I just washed my hair."
Great line. How come you don't
do movies with Harry anymore?
'Cause I married
the great Martin Weir.
He was a full-time job.
Have you read
Harry's new script?
No.
He says it's the best thing
he's ever read.
He must mean after
Slime Creatures III.
Was that why Harry
came over last night...
to ask you to help him
put Martin in a movie?
Harry's dreaming
of a $40 million production
he'll never get off the ground
with a star he'll never sign
with or without my help.
- He said Martin flipped over it.
- Martin's known for his flipping.
He flips over a script,
then when it comes time
to make a deal, he flips out.
Why don't I go over to Harry's office
and pick you up a copy of the script,
and you can read it yourself,
see what you think?
- Don't go out of your way.
- No, no. It's nothing.
I better go have a talk with Leo,
my runaway dry cleaner.
Right. See how your story ends.
You know, that movie Touch of Evil
is playing near my hotel.
We could go check it out
if you want,
go watch Charlton Heston
be a Mexican.
That's all right.
Another time.
See ya around.
See ya.
Hi. My name is Ray.
I'm a friend of Chili Palmer's.
Have you spoken with Mr. Palmer
since your husband blew up?
Oh, uh... once or twice.
And what was it you talked about?
- Nothing really. This and that.
- This and that?
I want us to be friends,
I really do,
and we all know that friends
don't hit each other...
unless they have to.
So what do you say
we start all over again,
and you tell me exactly
what the fuck is goin' on.
Huh? Okay?
Good evening, sir.
And a very good evening
to you, too, sir.
Thank you.
Leo, look at me.
I'd have never thought
you'd be so dumb,
leaving over 300 grand
in the closet under an extra blanket,
but I guess you are.
I didn't know
where else to keep it.
Where would you?
- How about a bank?
- No. They'd report it to the IRS.
You don't open an account.
You put it in a safe deposit box,
you dip in it whenever you want.
- How did you know that I was here?
- I'll give you another tip.
Next time you write to your wife,
don't use hotel stationery.
It was Fay, wasn't it,
told you about the money?
What, she tell you my whole
life history, for Christ sake?
Leo, I'm here
to save your ass.
How? By taking my money?
No. You get to keep the money that
you won today. That's yours.
It's all mine.
Leo, sit down.
I don't know how you got this far,
you're so fuckin' dumb,
but you're through,
and I'm gonna explain why.
I hope you're not so dumb
that you won't understand.
Ray Bones is the man
that you're dealin' with now,
and when Bones finds out what you did,
he's gonna take everything,
including the sporty little hat
you got on your head,
and then most likely he'll shoot you
so you won't tell on him.
Now, I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Now, you've got $310,000
in the bag here.
I'm gonna take the 300
you scammed from the airlines,
and the ten that's left over,
I'm gonna borrow from you
and pay back at another time.
Wait. You take all my money,
but you're borrowing part of it?
At 18%.
Now, don't ask another
fuckin' question. I'm leaving now.
But you won't know where I am.
I mean, I don't even know where I'll be.
I'll find you, Leo.
You leave a trail
like a fuckin' caterpillar.
Hey.
Hey, wait a minute.
What's this 18% a year shit?
You want to borrow 10,
the vig is three bills a week.
That's 15 for the vig plus the 10.
That's 25 big ones,
you go the whole year, buddy.
Hey, you hear me?
It needs a better ending, but, yes,
I can see why Harry wants to do it.
You understand,
I knew Harry was lying,
saying this wasn't any good
but holding on to it like, man,
you'd have to break his fingers
to get it away from him.
That's funny,
because I was thinking,
What am I gonna have to break
of yours to get it away from you?
Now, I'm explaining to you
what I'm doing here,
in case you thought
I came to rob the place
or rip off any of this
dusty old shit that the man has.
I wouldn't make you out to be
a burglar. Not in that outfit.
Harry called you his associate.
What does that mean?
I never heard your name
or read it in
The Hollywood Reporter
Just what he said.
I'm his associate.
You must bring
something heavy to the deal.
I do. Me.
It says here you're getting
Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy?
- That's right. We're getting Martin.
- Come on.
How you gonna do that?
I'm gonna take a gun,
I'm gonna put it to his head,
and I'm gonna say,
"Sign the fuckin' papers, Martin,
or you're dead." That's it.
I wonder... would that work?
You know who I see
for the part of Al Roxy?
Harvey Keitel.
Man could play it in his sleep.
He was pretty good
in that movie Fingers.
Missed that one.
You know who else?
Morgan Freeman.
You know Morgan's work?
Morgan Freeman.
He's a colored guy, though.
So what?
Where does it say in the script
the man's got to be white?
Color's what the part needs, man.
You need somebody to do it
with some style.
What do you think of the script?
The first thing
that's gotta go is the title.
This writer's name, Murray Saffrin,
would be better than Lovejoy.
I'm with you on that one.
You know what I'm thinking?
Why don't you and I, we sit down,
we write the script over
where it needs it.
You could write one of these?
There's nothing to it.
All you do, you get an idea,
you set down
what you want to say on paper,
then hire somebody else to fill in
the commas and shit where they belong
if you're not positive yourself.
Maybe fix up the spelling
where you have some tricky words...
although I've seen some scripts,
I know the words
weren't spelled right,
there was hardly
any commas in it at all!
So I don't think
that's too important.
All right, you get to the end.
You write in "fade out."
You're done.
- That's it.
- That's all there is to it?
Then what the fuck
do I need you for?
Because I'm offering
my services on this one, man.
I'll tell you what.
If I need a ride sometime,
I'll let you know.
How could you arrest me here?
This is my country.
That wasn't no misfire.
That was just to turn you around.
I don't wanna shoot you
in the back.
Unless you'd rather...
try to run for it.
Schwartz, is she there?
Did you bring my wife?
She's in the car.
They've got it all on tape.
- You sure you got enough?
- Go play it back. You'll see.
- How many did you frame?
- You better give me that gun.
"That's the second bullet
I stopped for you."
You're goin' down, Orson.
Isn't somebody going to come
and take him away?
Yeah, in just a few minutes.
You really liked him, didn't you?
"The cop did."
- The one who killed him.
- "He loved him."
Hank was a great detective,
all right.
"But a lousy cop."
What does it matter
what you say about people?
Wow, huh?
You been here the whole time?
No. I just caught the end.
You know, Welles
didn't even want to do this movie.
He had some studio contract
he couldn't get out of,
but sometimes
you do your best work
when you got a gun
to your head.
Yeah.
I brought you a copy of the script.
I already read it.
Harry left a copy at the house.
- How did you like it?
- It's not horrible.
I don't like the title and I don't like
some of the characters in it.
- So you read it.
- I haven't read it, but I will.
- You and Harry'll make a great team.
- Is that right?
Listen, I'm gonna
make a deal with him.
Oh, good, you found a character
you like for yourself?
No. I don't want to act in it,
I want to produce it,
especially if I
help him get Martin.
Hey, that's fair, huh?
Yeah. So, what do you
get out of it?
Is that why you come down here,
to ask me that?
I want to know.
Why would anyone
want to be in the movies?
Yesterday you were
a loan shark.
Yeah, but I was
never that into it,
especially this bullshit
about having respect.
Forget about it.
It's bad enough treating these guys
like they're your heroes,
smiling at stupid comments
they think are so funny.
You think the movie business
is any different?
Yeah, but I like movies,
and I figure if I help Harry
make a movie, I'll find out what to do
outside of raising money
and having an idea.
That doesn't sound so hard.
I mean, I was
in on the money business,
and I have a lot of ideas
floatin' around in my head.
Listen, I'm gonna talk
to Martin tomorrow morning.
I told Harry that I'd meet you and him
at the Abiquiu restaurant afterwards.
This just might work out.
- You never know.
- Just might.
Adios.
I spent eight hours at the airport
looking at people's bulges.
I don't like that.
This is not the way
we do business.
You two do not know
who you are messing with.
Listen to me.
I don't want no fucking key, okay?
I want the money.
You gonna smoke, you get
the hell off my $70-a-yard carpet.
Now, I told you where the money is.
All you got to do is go and get it.
No. I tell you something.
I go to that airport, and I open
that locker and they bust me,
I tell them I come
to get something for you.
- That's all I know.
- That's all you know, huh?
- That's all I know.
- Wait here. I'll be back directly.
Keep an eye
on Yahoo for me.
That's the way
you get things done.
What the fuck you gonna
do with that?
I'm taking you out, Yahoo.
You see that... the way the man
just went right over?
Maybe we could get
Chili Palmer up here.
You could fix
my railing to give way
like they do in the movies.
I invite the man up here
to have a look at my view,
get him to lean over the railing...
That's the dumbest idea
I ever heard.
Here's the thing, Bear.
I want to produce movies.
What's the point of living in L.A.
Unless you're in the movie business?
And I mean high up in it.
That's the reason why Harry's gonna
produce this Mr. Lovejoy with me,
not Chili Palmer.
I can't believe this map is accurate.
I bought it for ten bucks from a kid
sitting on a lawn chair on Sunset.
You were supposed to meet me
at the restaurant.
I know, but look at this...
it says, "Martin Weir's house,
across the street
from George Hamilton."
That must be George...
Nicole?
Jesus, it is you! It's Nicki now.
I don't believe this!
- I know her.
- Hi, Nicki.
Karen, shit, I didn't
see you there. How are you?
Come in, baby. You got to come in.
You gotta meet Martin.
Where have you been?
What have you been doing?
Chili was the only one at Momo's
didn't try to hit on me.
Oh, what a gentleman.
- Do you like my hair? Black?
- Oh, nice. Especially under the arms.
Martin won't let me shave.
Guess I fill some need... takes him
back to the '60s or something.
Speak of the devil.
- Karen, look at you.
- Hi, Martin.
You smell so good.
She always smells so good.
- Neat. Martin, this is Chili Palmer.
- Chili, is it?
Nice to meet you, Martin.
Chili's a gangster...
ran a club I used to play at
for another gangster back in Miami.
How is Momo these days anyway?
- Dead.
- Bummer.
I'll let you get to your movie talk.
Chili, do not leave
without saying good-bye to me.
So?
You know how beautiful you are?
You really are beautiful.
I'm sitting here. I'm...
...looking at you and having
flashbacks of memories of us.
Really?
Yeah, and I'm wondering...
how did it go wrong?
How did it all slip away?
It didn't slip away, Martin.
You did when you went off
to fuck Nicki at my birthday party.
Yeah. That was a good party.
Marty, you were so good
in that movie The Cyclone.
Martin.
Yeah. It was a beautiful role.
All I had to do was find
the character's center...
the stem I used to wind him up...
and he'd play, man.
He'd just play.
You had that down cold.
If I didn't know better,
I'd have thought
you was a made guy.
- Thank you.
- I mean, no acting there, right?
And the fink part.
Oh, man. Jesus Christ.
I never met a fink,
and I hope to God I never do,
but the way you played a fink,
that's how it's gotta be, right?
Yeah, yeah.
Two weeks before we started shooting,
I went back to Bensonhurst
just to hear you guys talk.
See, I'm Italian,
but I grew up in Tarzana,
so I wanted to get the rhythms
of your speech, you know.
Oh, we speak differently?
Well, it's more like your attitude,
your tone.
Your speech patterns demonstrate
a certain confidence in yourselves,
in your opinions,
your indifference to conventional views.
You know, it's like...
- Like we don't give a shit.
- Yeah, kind of. Yeah.
Anyway, once I get the authentic
sounds of speech,
the rhythms, the patois, you know,
I can actually get into their heads.
I can actually think the way
those guys do. Get inside.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I'm one of those guys.
What am I thinking?
Well, don't get me wrong.
An actual metamorphosis
doesn't take place.
That wouldn't be acting.
So you don't know
what I'm thinking?
No, I don't,
but I have to say I'm curious.
So you want to know
what I'm thinking?
- Yeah, if you want to tell me.
- I'm thinking about a movie.
One of mine?
No, one that we're producing.
With what,
wise-guy money? Hmm?
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
No. Look, Martin,
I'm not connected to that anymore...
not since I left that loan-sharking
operation in Miami.
What's the matter...
pressure got too much for you?
Pressure? I'm the one
who applied the pressure.
Oh, yeah?
Now, Martin,
can I ask you a question?
You're an actor.
Actors like to pretend, right?
We've been known to make believe.
Pretend this.
You're a shylock.
A guy owes you 15 grand.
He skips town. He takes off.
What do you do?
Oh, Martin, for Christ sake.
Just... you know...
I'm doing Shylock
instead of a shylock.
Right.
All right, what's my motivation?
The acquisition of money.
To collect.
To inflict pain if I have to.
Guy splits with 15 large
of my money, I go after him!
What the hell you think I'd do?
- Martin, look at me.
- I am looking at you.
No, look at me the way
I'm looking at you.
Put it in your eyes.
"You're mine, asshole,"
without saying it.
Okay. How about this?
What are you telling me,
that you're sleepy?
That you want to go to bed?
All right. Wait, wait.
Okay.
Now you're squinting
like you need glasses.
Well, what do you...
what do you...
- Look at me.
- What?
What I'm thinking is,
"You're mine. I fuckin' own you."
But what I'm not doing is feeling
one way or another about it.
You see,
you're not a person to me.
You're an entry in my book, that's all.
You're just a guy who owes me money.
All right. How about this?
Ooh. Wow.
Not bad, not bad.
- No wonder you're Martin Weir.
- Oh, yeah.
That's what I think of you, asshole.
Nothin'.
I believe it. I believe it.
So I turn this on
when I confront the guy?
You haven't found him yet,
because he split for Las Vegas.
- How do I know that?
- Because his wife told you.
Oh, his wife told me. Okay.
- Harry, how you doing?
- Bo, hi. Great.
I'm expecting some people.
You must be doing some big deals,
doing lunch in a place like this.
Yeah, I'm working on a few things.
I hear you bagged Martin Weir
for Mr. Lovejoy.
This town. Boy,
word gets around, doesn't it?
Chili Palmer told me...
last night, when he called me
over to your office to talk about it.
Chili Palmer
showed you my script?
Yeah. I was wondering why
he would do that.
So the wife sues the airline.
This is some gutsy babe.
Good-looking, too...
like Karen.
So when do I meet up with
the husband and give him the look?
That's not so simple.
There's a mob guy. Real hard-on.
You owe him money.
And he's after you,
wants to take you out
because you broke
his nose and shot him.
Right, right. Go ahead.
Keep going.
Well, at this point,
basically that's gotta be it.
You mean that's all you're gonna tell me?
Actually, Martin, the reason we came by
was to talk about Mr. Lovejoy.
We understand that you read the script,
that you loved it, you flipped.
Refresh my memory.
Listen, Harry, how'd you like
to get your hands on $500,000?
You pay me back at your convenience
with no interest.
Are you serious?
All I want in return is to work
on this movie with you.
In fact, I've already got
some strong ideas on how to fix it up.
Gentlemen, can I get you
anything else?
Let's get another one
for Mr. Zimm. Double.
You're just gonna give me
this 500 grand?
We'll talk about that, Harry,
but first I gotta know...
how'd you hook up
with this Chili Palmer?
Yeah, Mr. Lovejoy, it was good.
I'll call Buddy and set up a meeting.
- All right. Who's Buddy?
- Lufkin, his agent.
Karen knows him.
- But you are interested?
- Yeah, I'm intrigued.
It might help you if you take
another look at The Cyclone...
the way a visual fabric
is maintained
while the metaphor plays
on different levels.
Hey, Chili, is this your ride?
Yeah. I like to sit up high,
check everything out.
I mean, it is
the Cadillac of minivans.
Yeah. Check this out.
Wow. You mind
if I take it for a spin?
He was watching Letterman, huh?
Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.
So, did he ever find that dry cleaner,
the one with all that money on him?
Leo? I don't know.
I bet he did, but he ain't
giving you one penny of it
to help you out...
not the way I am.
Assuming I go along with this,
when could I have the 500 grand?
Whenever you want.
The money's in one of those jock bags
in $100 bills out at the airport,
just waiting in a locker to be picked up.
At the airport, huh?
It was waiting out there on a deal
that didn't go through, Harry,
one that you don't want to know about.
I don't know. L...
All right,
it's not the kind of thing you do.
So I'm thinking, why not send
your boy Chili Palmer?
If he gets busted, hit on the head,
you aren't out a thing, Harry.
C-18.
Magic number.
I don't think so.
I'm positive.
It was Susan Hayward.
No, no. It was
Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford...
Excuse me, Harry.
Wait here.
I'd like you to meet
my associate Bear... movie stuntman,
champion weight lifter,
as you might have noticed.
Throws things out I don't want.
I think you oughtta
turn around and go back to Miami.
- You're a stuntman?
- Yeah.
You any good?
Am I any good?
That's not bad for a guy his size.
I'll make you a deal.
If you can get outta here
before I take my coat off,
I won't clean up the floor with you
and mess up your pretty little costume.
You don't know me.
You only think you do.
That guy is a stuntman.
Rough business, this movie business.
I may have to go back
to loan-sharking just to take a rest.
Harry, what are you still doing
with those guys?
He happens to be loaning me
$500,000... no strings.
I can write
any kind of agreement I want.
Cash or check?
Cash, and it happens to be sitting
at the airport in a locker at this moment.
A locker at the airport?
Harry, Jesus Christ, tell me
you're not really that stupid.
You're being set up, Harry.
You pulled him out of that Freaks deal.
Now he's paying you back.
Is that right?
He's setting me up?
Why is it that Catlett said I should
send you to the airport to pick it up,
since you haven't done
a fucking thing for me
since you got involved in this
except show Bo Catlett my script?
You're right, Harry,
you're not the one being set up.
At least Bo has invested
in three of my movies.
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
- We?
- Chili and me.
Really?
He asked us to call Buddy,
set up a meeting.
A meeting...
you and Karen?
Guy's been in town two days,
and already he thinks
he's David O. Fuckin' Selznick.
Okay, Mr. O. Selznick,
should I make my deal with Bo,
or are you
finally gonna help me out
and have a talk with
your dry cleaner if you find him?
I found him, but forget about
Leo's money, Harry.
Do you have it?
If I gave you Leo's money,
you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass,
and that's
a whole new kind of trouble.
Who?
Ray Barboni... he lives in Miami.
He owns Leo now that Momo's dead.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus Christ!
Where do you get these names?
I'll tell you what I'll do for you, Harry.
I'll go out to the airport
tomorrow morning when it's crowded.
I'll check it out. If there's no problem,
I'll get you your money.
But I wouldn't get
my hopes up, Harry.
Maybe I should call
this Ray Barboni character
and see if he wants
to invest in my movie.
Don't waste your time, Harry.
He's not a movie fan.
Now, come on,
give me the key.
Oh, Harry.
You tell him he's gotta be
outta there by five in the morning.
Because the actor will only work
one night, that's why.
I gotta go. Yeah.
Coming.
- Who is it?
- Me.
- Oh, fuck!
- I heard that.
Hello, Doris.
Harry Zimm,
you look like a wet kiss.
Well, aren't you gonna offer me
whatever it is you taste like?
Come in, Doris.
My favorite color... putty.
Yeah, I like it.
What do you want, Doris?
- I miss Murray, Harry.
- Yeah, I miss him, too.
A hell of a good writer,
you know.
I should know.
I discovered him.
Made him what he was.
What he was was a hack.
He couldn't get a job
writing for anybody but you.
I'm being honest.
He was a lousy writer,
but he was a good husband.
I just didn't know
until it was too late.
Yeah, well, 20/20 hindsight and all that.
You know what they say.
I hate being alone.
The house is so quiet,
so lonely.
It needs... a man's touch.
Nice necklace, Doris.
I don't know
how I feel about this.
You seem to feel fine about it.
I mean morally.
You know, Murray was a friend.
Murray's dead.
Does this mean that
you're gonna reconsider
our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
No, but now that you mention it,
I did talk to a gorgeous young executive
over at Paramount the other day
who just happened
to get his hands on the script.
What did he say?
He said if Martin's interested,
I can get half a million for it, easy.
Oh, don't worry, Harry.
- I'm still gonna give you till Friday.
- How honorable of you.
You want me to go?
Just say so.
What the hell.
Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
- What?
- Ray Barboni?
Who is this?
Is this the guy
they call Ray Bones?
- It depends. Who is this?
- Who is this?
This is the one
telling you the way it is.
Okay, asshole?
Now, you want
your 300 grand or don't you?
What 300 grand
are you talking about?
The 300 grand
a guy named Leo Devoe
scammed off an airline.
The 300 grand that Chili Palmer
now has in his possession.
Hello? Are you there?
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.
I just don't like this anonymous crap.
It means you're either
a big chickenshit, or you're not for real.
Trust me, I am very for real.
Okay, then, so who are you?
I happen to work
for Harry Zimm, all right?
Who?
Harry Zimm. The man happens
to be a major Hollywood player.
I never heard of him.
Maybe that's because you've never
been out of fuckin' Miami, dipshit.
Maybe you oughtta get on a plane,
come out to L.A.,
take a meeting with Mr. Zimm.
Okay, so this Zimm guy... what is he
asking for, a finder's fee or something?
Hey, Zimm don't ask for dick.
Zimm tells you the way it is...
or else.
Or else what?
Excuse me. I was wondering
if you could help me out.
I got a gift in here for my wife.
It's a surprise.
I was wondering if you could put this
in locker C-17 for me.
Ten bucks.
Take you two minutes.
Yeah, okay.
You'll need some of this.
You gotta make it quick, though.
She's in the john.
C-17.
Good man.
Excuse me!
Let's go, boys.
Excuse me, sir.
Agent Curtis, Drug Enforcement.
These are
Agents Dunbar and Morgan.
- Would you come with us, please?
- Jesus Christ, what's going on?
Let's just follow him and behave
ourselves, what do you say?
Mr. Barbone?
Welcome to LA.
I'm Bobby, your driver.
Did you have a good flight?
I hope you drive better than
you fuckin' spell, jack-off.
The name is Barboni,
not Barbone, okay?
You want to go to the hotel first,
Mr. Escobar?
I want to get my fuckin' money.
- You live in Miami?
- That's right.
- What are you doing in Los Angeles?
- I'm in the movie business.
- You're an investor, is that it?
- No, I'm a producer.
- You have a card in this?
- Not yet. I just got started.
I'd appreciate you telling me
what this is about.
I got a John Doe warrant
says I can strip-search you.
Pat him down.
Put your hands on the wall.
Spread your legs.
What are you doing at the airport?
I was supposed to pick up my wife here,
but she wasn't on the plane.
Why, if you live in Miami,
is your wife coming in from Newark?
We had a fight, and she left me,
went back to Brooklyn,
so I called her and I said,
"Why don't you come out west?
Maybe a change of scenery
will get us back together again."
She said okay, but evidently,
she changed her mind.
- Your wife a Lakers fan?
- I am.
I'm a fan of everything
that's L.A.
I love it out here.
He's clean.
You can go.
What are you guys
looking for, anyway?
A bomb or something?
What is it?
Something that shouldn't be there.
Is that right?
Why don't you get an attendant
to open up the lockers and look in?
Maybe you'll find it.
That's an idea.
I'll think about it.
Yeah, I'd do that.
Then I'd get the right guy next time.
Mr. Barbone,
you ever want to go to the beach,
here's the freeway you take
that we're on.
Of course, on the weekend,
there's no traffic.
I'm from Miami fuckin' Beach,
and you want to show me the ocean?
And what about the sun?
Does that ever shine in this town,
or is this smog around all the time?
They say the smog's the reason
we have such beautiful sunsets.
That's what they say, huh?
What a bunch of fuckin' bullshit.
I don't know how I could have
missed you in that shirt.
It's the same as the other one,
except a different-colored hibiscus,
is that right?
- You didn't have the key on you?
- You think I'd be standing here?
If you're gonna set someone up
and you want it to work,
it's gotta be a surprise.
Can you remember that?
Spotted 'em, huh?
Did you see it work in some movie
that you got beat up in?
Got to ask you for that key back.
Hey, wait a minute.
The setup didn't work,
and you want the key back?
Bo said if you didn't open the locker,
the deal's off.
You're serious?
This is how you guys do business?
I'm surprised you're not dead.
There's no fuckin' way
you're gonna get that key, okay,
unless you put a gun to my head,
and then maybe we'll talk.
Now, move away
from the fuckin' car.
I don't need a gun for you.
All right, all right.
Slow down.
Breathe through your mouth.
Slow. Breathe.
Bear, look at me.
You tell your boss I don't want
to see him again.
He made a deal with Harry,
and a deal's a deal.
You got that?
Okay, get up.
What are you hanging around
a guy like that for, anyway?
You were in the movies.
You were a stuntman, right?
What's he ever done that
he can talk about?
- You okay?
- Not too bad.
How about when you fell
down the stairs?
Pulled my quadriceps.
So how many movies
you been in?
About 60.
- No shit?
- No shit.
What were some of them?
You didn't see none of 'em.
- What were some of 'em?
- You wouldn't know any names.
Who is it?
I'm the dipshit
who's never been out of Miami.
Well, Mr. Barboni,
what a nice surprise.
Good to see you.
Have a seat.
Right here, right here.
Ray... Ray Bones.
Barbone. Sorry.
Oh, yes. Uh...
They say the fuckin' smog
is the fuckin' reason
you have such beautiful
fuckin' sunsets.
Yeah.
What do you mean,
he faked them out?
He knew it was a setup
and he was ready for it.
- So where's the money?
- I guess it's still in the locker.
You guess.
You mean you don't know?
I mean I don't care, Bo.
I really don't care.
Bear, I'm gonna call you later.
Mr. Escobar, what a surprise.
Welcome to L.A.
Where's my nephew?
Your who?
Yayo! Where is he?
I haven't seen Yayo.
He's my sister's kid...
no father, not too bright.
Personally, I think he's a retard.
I only gave him the job as
a favor to my sister, you understand.
Oh, sure. Family.
I know how that goes.
He comes up here
with our product.
He's supposed to come back home
with the $500,000.
He never shows up.
Meanwhile, my sister's
going crazy.
She's calling me all the time.
She's worried.
Me, I just want to know what happened
to my fucking money.
I don't know.
I gave the man his money.
I sent him on his way.
You gave him the money?
I gave him the key to a locker
that had the money in it.
Why would you do that...
put the money in a locker?
Because there were
a zillion DEA guys
hanging around the terminal.
A zillion? That's a lot, huh?
Mr. Escobar, maybe your nephew
panicked and took off.
Why are you talking to me
this bullshit?
I think maybe I have Ramon and Cesar
staple your tongue to your chin!
What do you think?
I think you speak
very good English, Mr. Escobar.
We're gonna spend the weekend
at the Universal Sheraton.
Take the tour. See the shark.
Check out that
Miami Vice Action Spectacular.
Oh, nice. Yeah.
After, we're gonna come back here,
get my money.
Oh, yeah.
And Yayo, too.
His fuckin' nephew?
When you get to town,
you go straight to the bank,
Hey, bro, I'm in town. It don't matter.
We got dick in the bank.
We dumped it all
into Harry's movie.
I'm talking about you,
Ray Barboni,
owning a piece
of a major motion picture.
How much of a piece
is entirely up to you.
What I'm saying is,
you could invest
part of the 300 grand that
Palmer owes you, or all of it.
It's entirely up to you.
Where's Chili Palmer?
Where's Leo Devoe?
Where's my fuckin' money?
Ray... look at me.
What?
Look at me, Ray.
Did you just say look at you?
- Look at me, Ray.
- I'll tell you what, Harry.
Why don't you take
a fuckin' look at this?
And have a peek at this.
You know, Harry, this...
is the exact fuckin' thing
I needed...
a little fuckin' exercise...
after that long fuckin'...
...plane ride.
You got a big problem, Harry.
Well, come on, Harry,
don't pass out on me.
Look at me, Harry.
Where's my money?
Harry, I'm gonna ask you
one more time,
then I gotta shoot you,
you don't tell me
what I want to know.
- Where's my money?
- Your money?
Who the fuck are you?
I'm Ray Barboni from Miami.
What, like that's supposed
to mean something to me?
The man you're standing on there
happens to belong to me and my partner.
- This piece of shit owes me money.
- Get in line.
But I don't like waiting in lines.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami.
You want something,
you gotta talk to me.
No, no, no, no. Fuck you, fuck ball.
I mean, L.A. Is an open city,
and I don't think I have to
get permission from nobody for nothing.
Oh, really?
Well, uh, I just closed it.
You must be what they call
one of those quick-draw artists,
because of the way you've got your gun
stuck way down in your belt like that.
What do you got there, huh?
A wop 9?
Fuckin' Fiat of guns.
Always jamming on you
at the wrong time.
Don't you puke
on my shoes, Harry.
Hey, Harry,
I want you to do me a favor.
I want you to take this gun
and put a pill in the bro over there.
Now, I know what you're thinking.
"Why the fuck would I shoot him?
The guy's already dead."
But you see, Harry,
the police, they have these tests,
tell you whether or not
a guy fired a gun.
And I was never here.
Do you understand that, Harry?
I was never here.
And if you say I was,
I'm gonna come back
and I'm gonna throw you
right out of that fuckin' window.
All right, knock it off, Harry.
We haven't got a lot of time here.
That's it. That's it.
Not a worry in the world.
Your pool needs skimming.
Yeah. That was Martin.
He wants to have lunch tomorrow,
if you can make it.
- Depends on who's paying.
- Definitely not Martin.
Movie stars, they never
pick up the check.
They have no idea
what things cost.
Of course, most of 'em
don't know their phone number
and a lot don't even know
their zip code.
I don't know.
I just can't get used to the idea
that the two of you were together.
- You don't like Martin much, do you?
- No, I do. I do.
I think he's... I think he's short.
But, uh...
I know he's a good actor
and everything,
but what was it exactly
that you saw in him?
Martin was different then.
He wasn't a movie star.
Anyway, what about your story?
You thought of a title yet?
How about Chili's
Hollywood Adventure?
I don't know.
That's a different story.
I'm still working on that one.
I'm still getting
the visual fabric together.
But I have added to it.
- Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
- Really?
She looks a lot like you.
I think you could be an actor.
I know you're acting sometimes,
but you don't show it.
You thought I was fakin'?
No, not then.
I mean in general.
You don't mean
a movie star, though, right?
You're talking more like
a character actor.
Well, whichever.
I could see myself in the parts
that Robert DeNiro plays.
Maybe even an Al Pacino movie,
you know, playin' a real hard-on.
But I couldn't see myself
in them movies
where, like, the three guys
get left with a baby
and they don't know
how to take care of it,
so they act like
grown-up assholes.
- Chili, look at me.
- I couldn't...
Doll, you might want to come by
Cedars tonight and visit Harry.
Let's go.
What can I tell ya?
I stopped by his office
to see if he wanted to take me
to Le Dome for dinner
when I see Harry
and some other man lying on the floor.
Good night, Todd.
'Night, Lewis.
- Oh, man. Jesus.
- Harry, my God.
He can't talk...
he's full of Demerol.
What happened?
According to Todd...
Sergeant Randall...
a man named Ronnie
came by Harry's office
to collect on a debt.
- He got rough and Harry shot him.
- You shot Ronnie?
Hello, hello.
Okay. Here we go.
Looks like Mr. Zimm here
has a broken jaw
and some neck trauma
to go with these fractured hands.
Excuse us, folks.
Harry, Martin wanted to meet us
for lunch tomorrow at the Ivy,
and I'd cancel, but he's going
to Cannes next week.
So I really think that
maybe Chili and I should still go.
Okay, who wants to take a crack
at wiring Mr. Zimm's jaw?
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch!
Hi, Bo.
Hey, Farrah.
Little honey bunny.
You wipe your feet
before you come in here?
- Yeah.
- That's my girl.
Keep Uncle Bo's carpet
nice and white.
I been calling you.
Where you been?
See the paper?
Yeah, I seen it.
I don't believe it.
Says Harry shot Ronnie
five times...
four through the chest
and one through his foot.
His foot. Jesus.
Poor Ronnie.
Tonight, later on,
I got one for you,
doesn't involve any heavy work.
I want you to go take a look
around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
No, I can't. I can't.
I gotta take Farrah to her mother's
in Costa Mesa, and...
...and that don't matter,
'cause I quit!
I don't work for you no more.
I just came down here to tell you
right to your face
so we got no misunderstanding.
Bear, the Colombians are in L.A.,
all upset about their money.
Now if that ain't enough,
it turns out as a bonus
that Yo-yo was Escobar's nephew.
That's your problem.
You're the one that shot the guy.
Hey, honey bunny.
Come here, Farrah.
Come here, honey bunny.
Come and see Uncle Bo.
Come on. Yeah!
You know how Uncle Bo
hates being alone.
In fact, he hates it so much,
he takes a fall,
he's not gonna fall by himself.
He's gonna plea-deal his way out...
give up his ace stuntman,
now one of the West Coast
dope kings...
if they go easy on the Cat.
I hear in federal joints,
they let you spend an extra
five minutes with your daddy
on Father's Day.
Just let her go, Bo.
After this one, I'm out.
You understand?
This is the last time we talk
to each other.
You remember Harry's story
about the dry cleaner
Palmer was after...
the one that stole that $300,000
from the airline?
Yeah, what about him?
Tonight, you go have a look
around Palmer's hotel room
while I check out Karen Flores' place.
See if he hasn't
stashed it somewhere,
and you meet me back here
at midnight.
So what kind of food they got
at this Ivy place?
It's Continental,
but it doesn't matter.
Martin won't order
from the menu anyway.
Why not?
Because movie stars can never
order straight from the menu.
They have to think of something
they have to have that isn't on the menu.
Harry, what are you doin' here?
You're supposed to be in the hospital.
Hey, Harry, you look like you oughtta be
in one of your own horror movies.
- My project.
- What'd he say?
"My project."
Mr. Zimm!
Hey, Harry!
Attaboy, killer.
Right this way.
You're a celebrity, Harry.
You should have shot someone
a long time ago.
Hi.
Excuse me.
How you doing?
Hello. Hi.
How you doing?
Whoa. Hey, Chili.
- Good to see you.
- Great to see you.
Oh, Harry.
Oh, my goodness.
- Hi, Martin.
- Sweet face.
You look great.
You smell good, too.
Thanks.
So, Harry, I hear you had
quite an experience.
Well, anyway,
I'm glad you're okay.
You know what else?
I'm really glad that
you rejected me 10 years ago
when I auditioned for the part
of Eddie Solomon,
the pedophile clown
in Birthday Boy.
If I'd gotten that part,
I might have been typecast.
Have you guys ordered? Because I
really have something after this.
Can we order?
Excuse me. Could you...
- Hi. What's your name?
- Stephanie.
Hi, Stephanie.
I feel like an omelet.
Can you make
an egg-white omelet
with shallots only slightly browned,
very little olive oil, and no salt?
Bring one for the table.
We'll pick on it.
No.
I know. How about having
those strawberry frappes...
you know, the little drinks
with the little strawberries in them?
And bring two straws for Harry.
Anyway, I think the romance angle
In your story is critically important.
This shouldn't be just
a hop in the sack for either of them.
These two should fall
deeply in love.
Which two?
Later, when their lives are in danger
and the mob guy's chasing them,
it not only heightens the tension,
but it adds a wistful element
to their romance.
Mob guy?
I have to consider, as the mob guy,
it's another man's wife
I'm sleeping with, so...
- And after all, you have such morals.
- Mob guy?
Look, I have to run,
but what I would like to see is that...
they begin to have misgivings
about wanting the money.
This becomes a moral dilemma
for the two of them.
They rationalize taking it,
but in the end, they can't.
What money?
The 300 large.
What other money is there?
I know I shouldn't be talking about this
until I've read the script,
but I have such
a good feeling about this.
I am that shylock.
Look at me, Harry!
Not bad.
You're really getting it down.
It scares me
how well I know this guy.
I mean, I could do this tomorrow,
no further preparation.
Doll face...
you really should think about
getting back into acting.
We could do something together.
- I'll give it some heavy thought.
- Okay.
Take care of yourself, Harry.
Enjoy.
Here, let me help you out.
Go ahead.
Suck harder.
Chili, wake up.
Somebody's downstairs.
- It's Harry.
- How you know?
He's doin' the same thing
you did to him...
playin' Letterman on TV.
That's not Dave,
that's a movie.
- You gonna go down?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
- I know, I'm goin', I'm goin'.
- Karen, you got a gun?
- No.
Any kind of gun will do.
- No.
- No?
Guess I'll take that drink now,
Charlie.
You want that gun?
Pick it up.
- I need the money.
- What money?
The 300 grand that you got
from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
Let me get this straight.
You break into
Karen Flores' house
and you ask for 300 grand
that doesn't belong to you?
Just give me the money,
I'll be on my way.
I can't believe how you guys
do business out here.
I can't believe how fucked up
your organization is.
I'll tell you what...
how about I count to three
and I'll organize your fuckin' brain
all over the wall back there?
- How about that? One...
- You're gonna shoot me now, huh, Bo?
- Just a second. Two...
- I can't believe this.
She can't talk right now.
That's a really nice scream.
They oughtta give you more work.
All right, I'll get you
the money, but it's not here.
I gotta go get it.
Okay, fine. In the meantime,
I'll just hold onto her for safekeeping.
- Now, you know Laurel Canyon?
- I'll find it.
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue,
right off of Laurel.
I'll be there, Karen.
You get the money?
No. What is this?
Plan "B."
You make yourself comfortable.
- Karen Flores is plan "B"?
- Don't ask questions, Bear.
- She's a movie star!
- I don't care what she is.
- Oh, for Christ sake.
- Gonna make a little trade.
- Trade for what?
- The money, Bear.
You get life for kidnapping!
Just calm down, Bear.
You're talkin' about life in prison,
you want me to calm down?!
- Do not fade on me now, Bear.
- You're gonna shoot me now?
Go ahead, then! Put me
outta my misery. Go ahead!
I said calm the hell down,
unless you want to spend
the rest of your life
holding Farrah on your lap
in a room full of goddamn felons!
So... this is one of them houses
you see hangin' off the side of the cliff.
Where's Karen?
In my bathroom.
Where's the money?
- Let me see her.
- Go ahead.
You okay?
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet,
for Christ sake.
She's great.
Give me the money.
First, I'm gonna settle something
between you and me.
I've been shot at before...
once by accident,
twice on purpose... and I'm still here.
Once by accident,
twice on purpose... and I'm still here.
And I'm gonna be here
as long as I want,
which means that
you gotta be somewhere else...
and nowhere near me,
Karen, or Harry.
Now, here's your money.
Take it, and leave the movie business
to the rest of us
who know what we're doing.
Come on, Karen.
You broke in my house,
and I have a witness to it.
What?
Only this time it ain't no
John Wayne or Dean Martin
shooting bad guys
in El Dorado.
Robert Mitchum played the drunk
in El Dorado.
Dean Martin played the drunk
in Rio Bravo.
Basically, it was the same part.
John Wayne did the same in both...
he played John Wayne.
I can't wait for you to be dead.
Are you gonna let him talk to me...
That's for the stairs,
and that's for the airport!
Get him off my carpet
before he starts to bleed.
You want to take this guy out?
Come out on the deck,
make it look like he came at us.
You shoot him. Self-defense.
Get up.
Shouldn't he have a weapon,
a knife or something?
Get it later.
All right, Bear.
That's enough! Enough, Bear!
You keep hitting him like that, he's not
gonna look like he broke in anymore.
He's gonna look like somebody
beat him up and then shot him.
No, he ain't.
Hold on, man.
We're gonna get the fuck outta here.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Karen, what the fuck are you doing?
- Oh, shit!
- She's shootin' at us! Come on.
Oh, I'm sorry! Sorry!
Wow.
How do you think that happened?
Beats the shit outta me.
- Were you scared up there?
- You bet.
- You don't act like it.
- I was scared then, not now.
How long you want me
to be scared?
I'll be right back.
How'd you get in here?
It was easy.
I told them I was you.
I acted real stupid,
and they believed me.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Please, don't insult me.
Just turn around.
Turn around.
Do you know that you're the dumbest
fuck I ever met in my whole life?
Let me take a look
in these pockets.
You should have told me
about Leo Devoe
as soon as you
found out about him.
Why would I do
something like that?
Because the guy is a customer
of mine, that's why, dummy.
He belongs to me.
Well, well, well, well, well.
What have we here?
"C-18."
Now, I wonder what this could be?
A locker key?
But where's the locker?
I checked the bag at the airport.
Which terminal?
Which terminal?
Sovereign.
You found Leo, huh?
You found him, you took
the poor bastard's money,
you put it in a locker
all ready to go.
Why haven't you left?
I like it out here.
You know, Chili,
I been thinking...
there's really no reason
why you and I shouldn't get along.
Forget about all of that stuff
that happened before.
I don't even remember
how this mess started.
You took a swing at me
for some fuckin' thing.
I say fuck it.
I say you owe me money.
I say fuck that.
I say you owe me
the juice out of the money.
I say fuck that, too.
I say live and let die, but this...
this is strictly
between you and I.
You say nothing to nobody
about this. Understood?
- Whatever you say, Ray.
- I think it's only fair, don't you?
Well, then, it's all settled.
I'll see you around.
Dumb fuck.
Come on.
The fuckin' airport.
Bingo, boys. Let's go.
Hey, Bones. Look at me.
Fuck you, fuckball.
- Damn.
- Cut! Cut!
I am pushing the right button.
You're not pushing the right button,
or else that thing
wouldn't fall on the floor.
But it's all right.
Bear-man, show him
how to do it, okay?
- I don't know, maybe it's...
- What do you want to do, Harry?
We'll get it fixed.
Wrap. It's a wrap.
Come back tomorrow.
Fuck!
Harry, what are you doing?
You should have
gone into overtime to get that shot.
This is only the second day.
We're already two weeks behind.
And do me a favor,
all right, Harry?
Here's what I don't understand.
Martin already told me
that he loves it.
Buddy, I just don't think that
Martin is right, okay?
Why the hell not?
Because he's too short. Come on.
Why does he keep pushing
Martin Weir?
Packaging.
You can't make a Martin Weir
into a Mel Gibson.
Do you want to go to Morton's
or Dan Tana's?
I don't know.
