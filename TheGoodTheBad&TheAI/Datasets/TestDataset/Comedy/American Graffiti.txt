Hey, what do
you say, Curt?
Last night in town,
you guys gonna
have a little bash
before you leave?
The Moose have been
looking for you all day.
They got worried.
Thought you were trying
to avoid them
or something.
What is it?
What've you got?
Oh, great.
That's $2,000, man.
$2,000!
Mr. Jennings gave it
to me to give to you.
He says he's sorry
it's so late,
but it's
the first scholarship
the Moose Lodge
has given out.
And he says they're
all very proud of you
back at the Lodge.
Cute. Why don't you
hold it for me
for a while?
Hey, I don't want it.
Take it. It's yours.
I'll take it.
STEVE: Listen,
if your sister calls...
I'll talk to you later, okay?
CURT: Wait a second.
Wait a second.
She can wait.
Make it short and sweet,
though, huh?
Listen,
I don't think I'm gonna
be going tomorrow.
Come on, what are you
talking about?
Well, I was thinking
I could wait a year,
you know.
Go to City for a while.
You chicken fink.
Wait a minute.
After all we went through
to get accepted?
We're finally getting
out of this turkey town,
and now you want
to crawl back into
your cell, right?
You want to end up
like John?
You just can't
stay 17 forever.
CURT: It's just...
You've got to get that
through your head!
I just need some time.
I've got to
go talk to Laurie.
Now take it. Take it!
Now, we're leaving in
the morning, all right?
We're leaving
in the morning.
WOLFMAN ON RADIO:
We're gonna rock and roll
ourselves to death, baby.
You got
The Wolfman Jack show!
Don't...
Don't with the thing!
Will you stop it with
the Big Bopper stuff?
GIRL: Hi, John.
Hi, John.
JOHN: Not too good, huh?
Why is it every girl
that comes around here
is ugly,
or has a boyfriend?
Where is
the dazzling beauty
I've been searching for
all my life?
Yeah, I know
what you mean.
The pickings are
really getting slim.
The whole strip
is shrinking.
I remember about
five years ago,
take you
a couple of hours and
a tank full of gas
just to make one circuit.
It was really something.
Hey, John.
Someone new in town.
You gonna go after him?
Hey, listen, Professor.
If he can't find me,
then he ain't even
worth racing, right?
Big shot.
Well?
Where was I?
How you thought
high school romances
were goofy
and we started
going together
just because
you thought I was
kind of cute and funny,
but then
you suddenly realized
you were in love with me,
it was serious, and...
Oh. You were leading up
to something kind of big.
You make it sound like
I'm giving dictation.
Well, seriously,
what I meant was
that since we do care
for each other so much,
and since we should
really consider ourselves
as adults now,
I...
Could I have a couple
of those fries?
TERRY: Come on, Budda.
Come on.
STEVE: Where was I?
LAURIE: "Consider
ourselves adults."
Right. Right.
I thought maybe,
before I leave,
we could agree
that seeing other
people while I'm away
can't possibly hurt,
you know?
You mean
dating other people?
I think
it would strengthen
our relationship.
Then we'd know for sure
that we're really in love.
Not that
there's any doubt.
I think you're right.
I mean,
we're not kids anymore,
and it's silly to think
that when we're
we shouldn't be able
to see other people
and go out.
Laurie, listen,
I didn't ask
for that back.
I know. I just sort of
think it's juvenile now.
I'll keep it at home.
It's less conspicuous there.
You don't want
to wear it?
I didn't say that.
I understand,
and I'm not upset.
I mean,
I can't expect you
to be a monk
or something
while you're away.
And I got a really neat
record collection.
I even got
Pledging My Love
by Johnny Ace.
Look, how can
you love Nelson
when he's going out
with Marilyn Gator?
Since he dumped
on you, I was...
He didn't dump on me,
you little dip!
Oh, hi, Steve.
Hey.
Hey, Sis.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
What is it?
Nothing!
And I've decided
that I'm gonna let you
take care of my car
for me while I'm away.
At least until Christmas.
See, I'm coming back
for a couple of weeks
at Christmas.
Now, I've got some
very simple instructions
for you.
Here's the keys.
First of all,
only 30-weight Castrol R.
Now, I've written
the tire pressure
and stuff
on a pad
in the glove...
Are you listening?
Hey, what's wrong?
Are you crying?
I can't believe it.
I don't know
what to say.
I'll love
and protect this car
until death do us part.
This is
a super fine machine.
This might even be better
than Darryl Starbird's
Superfleck Moon...
It is! It's better
than Darryl Starbird's
Superfleck Moonbird.
Budda?
Yeah?
How would you like to go
to the drive-in movies
with me?
You've got
to be kidding.
No! Would I kid you
about a thing like that?
I have a new car. Hey!
Hey, hey,
did she do that to you?
Hey, Curt,
you want to bomb around?
I want to try out
my new wheels.
Well, I'd like to, Toad,
but I'm gonna go
with Steve and Laurie
to the hop.
And besides,
I'd spoil your luck,
anyway.
Yeah. Right.
Tonight, things are
gonna be different.
Hey, hey,
wait a minute,
wait a minute.
You're going to the hop?
The freshman hop?
CURT: Yeah.
Oh, come on, man.
That place is for kids.
You two just got
your ass out of there.
Don't go back there.
CURT: You ain't got
no emotions?
We are going to remember
all of the good times,
is what we're gonna do.
Yeah, well, go.
Why won't you
come with us?
Bullshit, man!
Come on.
For old times' sake.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, listen. You go.
Go ahead, Curtsy baby.
You go on over there
and you remember
all the good times
you won't be having.
I ain't going off
to some goddamned
fancy college!
I'm staying right here!
Having fun, as usual.
Jesus, Milner! You're
really in a great mood
tonight, you know that?
What's the matter,
John?
Did I do something wrong?
I'm sorry.
Ah, man, it's nothing.
Well, then we'll
see you later, okay?
Right.
We'll all do
something together,
you know,
before Steve leaves.
Yeah.
Oh, wait a minute.
Now you're not going?
I don't know.
Oh.
Jesus.
Hey, Zudo.
Hey, Milner!
Hey, man,
what happened
to your flathead?
Huh?
What happened
to your flathead?
Your mother!
What?
Your mother!
Hey, we been
talking about you.
Yeah?
Yeah. There's a very
wicked '55 Chevy
looking for you.
Yeah, I know.
Watch out for the cop
that's in Jerry's Cherry.
Yeah. All right, thanks.
BOZO: Hey, Toad!
Is that you in
that beautiful car?
Jeez, what a waste
of machinery.
Hey, kid!
WOLFMAN ON RADIO:
All right, baby.
Here we go
with another call
out of the station.
Can you dig it?
Answer the phone, dummy!
MAN: Pinkie's Pizza.
WOLFMAN: Yeah, listen,
you got any more
of those secret
agent spy scopes?
Hit parade
on the stethoscope?
No, no.
The secret agent
spy scope, man,
that pulls in the moon,
the stars, the planets,
and the satellites,
and the little
bitty space men.
You must have
the wrong number,
partner.
Bye!
What?
What did you say?
Wait. What did you say?
What did you say?
Quick. Quick.
Hang a right.
STEVE: What? Why?
Steven,
cut over to G Street.
I just saw a vision.
I saw a goddess.
Come on.
You gotta catch up to her.
I didn't see anything.
Come on, Curt.
We can't be
spending half the night
chasing girls down
for you.
Laurie, I'm telling you,
this was the most perfect,
dazzling creature
I've ever seen!
She's gone.
Forget it.
She spoke to me.
She spoke to me,
right through the window!
I think she said,
"I love you."
That means nothing
to you people?
You have no romance,
no soul?
Someone wants me.
Someone roaming
the streets wants me.
Will you turn the corner?
LAURIE: Oh, Curt.
JOHN: Oh, oh.
Later.
Alligator.
JOHN: Hey,
you're new around here.
Where you from?
GIRL: Turlock.
Turlock?
You know a guy
named Frank Bartlett?
No. Does he go
to Turlock High?
Well, he used to.
He goes to JC now.
Do you go to JC?
Yeah, sure.
Oh, wow!
Do you know Guy Phillips?
Yeah, sure.
I got him in a class.
Oh, he's so boss.
How would you like
to ride around with me
for a while?
I'm sorry, I can't.
I'm going steady.
Oh, come on!
I just can't.
You're just riding around
with a bunch of girls.
Hey, how about
somebody else in there?
Anybody else want
to go for a ride?
Look, you got
nothing to fear.
I'm as harmless
as a baby kitten.
CAROL: I'll go, I'll go.
Judy's sister'll go
with you.
Is that all right?
Yeah. Sure.
Judy, her sister,
her mother, anybody.
I'll take them all.
Listen. We'll go up
and stop at that light.
It'll turn red by
the time we get there.
All right?
You ever get tired
of going steady
with somebody
that ain't around,
I'm up for grabs.
So, you're Judy's
little... Oh, shit.
How old are you?
Old enough.
How old are you?
I'm too old for you.
You can't be that old.
Listen, listen.
I think you better go back
and sit with your sister.
Hey, where are
they anyway?
Are they coming
back or something?
This is a joke, right?
This better be a joke,
'cause I'm not
driving you around.
But you asked me.
What's the matter?
Am I too ugly?
Judy doesn't
want me with her,
and now you don't
want me with you.
Nobody wants me.
Even my mother
and father hate me.
Everybody hates me.
No, they don't hate you.
You throw me out,
I'll scream.
Oh, no, no, no,
stay cool.
Everything's all right.
We'll find your sister.
Can't be too hard
to find.
GIRL: John, you gonna
be there tonight?
Oh, shit.
Hey, get down.
Hey! Cool.
Hey, is this what they
call "copping a feel"?
What? No. Get up.
No. Jesus.
What's your name?
My name?
Mud, if anybody sees you.
WOLFMAN ON RADIO: Here come
old Buster Brown, man!
What've you got
in there, kid?
More than
you can handle.
Say, excuse me,
but I think we've
had an accident.
Well, God damn it,
I won't report you
this time, but next time,
just watch it,
will you?
Well, good evening.
Good evening.
How are you?
Yeah, hi.
This is really
a beautiful car,
you know that?
Of course
you know it.
You know what I'd
like to give you
for this car?
I'd like to
give you $1,000.
I can't give you that,
but I'm not gonna
give you a whole line.
I'm gonna tell you
what I can give you.
Come over here.
I'm not...
How would you like,
for $525, to be owner
of this
practically new 'vette?
Now, I'll tell you
what I'm going to do.
I'm gonna knock 10%
right off the top.
How about that?
Now that's $98 down,
understand. $98 down.
I'm sorry, no.
$98 a month.
Now, you ask me,
"How can I do this?"
I'll tell you
how I can do it.
My boss, he wants
to get rid of
the sporty cars.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
He wants to get rid
of the sporty cars.
I don't think
it's a good idea.
Listen. I want you
to listen to me.
No, I'm busy.
I've got some things
I've gotta do.
I'm gonna give you a deal
you can't say no to.
Leave me alone,
for God's sake!
SINGER: One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Let's go!
Well, why are you
so depressed?
You'll forget him
in a week.
After you're
elected senior queen,
you'll have
so many boys
after your bod.
Peggy,
the whole point is
I do not want
to go out with
any other guys.
Laurie,
I know it's a drag,
but you can't just...
Look,
remember what happened
to Evelyn Chelnick?
When Mike went
into the Marines,
she had
a nervous breakdown,
and was acting so wacky,
she got run over by a bus.
I just wish I could go
with him or something.
Oh, Laurie, jeez!
Come on.
Hey, zit makeup!
Hey, come on...
Hey, everybody...
Just cool it,
huh, Steve?
Let me see some
of that stuff.
You leaving tomorrow?
Uh-huh.
You and Laurie
engaged yet?
No, but we got it
all worked out.
We're still gonna
be going together,
but we can date
other people.
And screw around.
I know.
Hey, I hear
college girls
really put out.
MAN: Cherry bomb!
Come on.
"Come on" what?
Let's dance.
No, thanks.
Laurie, I said
I wanna dance.
Well, Steven,
who's stopping you?
I thought since this is
our last night together
for three months,
you might wanna
dance with me.
How sentimental of you.
You'll be back
at Christmas.
I want to dance now,
not at Christmas.
Come on.
Get your cooties
off me.
Don't make a scene.
Go ahead. Slug me.
Scar my face!
I wouldn't dance with you
if you were the last guy
left in this gym.
This is getting good.
Come on, Eddie,
I'll dance with you.
You don't mind,
do you, Peggy?
Joe College
strikes out.
MR. WOLFE: Curtis!
Curtis, come here.
Help me, will you?
I'm surrounded.
Come here.
You won't dance?
Come on.
No, really,
I'd like to,
but I can't.
If old Mr. Simpson
came in here
and saw me dancing with
one of you sexy little...
Excuse me.
One of you young ladies,
he'd have my rear end.
Okay? Thank you.
MR. WOLFE: Hey, Warren.
Come on, gentlemen,
back inside.
Put it out.
Let's go.
Kids.
Want a cigarette?
All right.
I thought you'd left.
No, not yet.
I have no matches.
That's all right.
Brother,
how do I get stuck
with dance supervision?
Will you tell me that?
You going back east?
I remember
the day I went off.
Got drunk as hell
the night before. Just...
Blotto.
Blotto. Exactly.
Barfed on the train
all the next day, too.
Cute. Very cute.
Where'd you go again?
Middlebury, Vermont.
Right.
Yeah. Got a scholarship.
Only stayed a semester?
One semester,
after all that.
Came back here.
Yeah.
Why'd you come back?
Decided I wasn't
the competitive type.
I don't know.
Maybe I was scared.
Well,
I think I may
find that I'm not
the competitive
type myself.
What do you mean?
Well, I'm not
really sure
that I'm going.
Hey, now,
don't be stupid.
Experience life.
Have some fun, Curtis...
JANE: Bill?
Mr. Wolfe?
Can I speak
with you a minute?
Hi, Curt.
Jane.
Good luck, Curtis.
Yeah. I'll see you.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
WOLFMAN ON RADIO:
A Wolfman Jack exclusive!
The Beach Boys, baby!
A brand-new group!
I predict they
gonna go a long way.
This is called
Surfin' Safari.
CAROL: So, the next night
we found out where
they were parked
and went out
with ammunition.
Don't you have
some homework
or something to do?
No sweat.
My mother does it.
Anyway,
he thought he was had.
He started the car
and couldn't see
through the windshield,
and zoomed straight
into the canal.
I still got some,
so don't try anything.
Hey, watch it,
will you?
Jesus Christ!
Thanks a lot.
Hey, driving is
a serious business.
I ain't having
no accidents
just because of you.
Come on.
Don't give me any grief.
I'm warning you.
Spare me, killer.
Oh, shit!
Why did you do that?
I don't like
that surfing shit.
Rock and roll's
been going downhill
ever since
Buddy Holly died.
Don't you think
the Beach Boys are boss?
You would,
you grungy little twerp.
Grungy!
You big weenie.
If I had a boyfriend,
he'd pound you.
Yeah, sure.
Ah, shit! Holstein!
Good. A cop.
I'm gonna tell him
you tried to rape me.
Oh, no, no, no.
It's past curfew,
I'm gonna tell him
how old I am,
my parents
don't know I'm out and
you tried to rape me.
Yeah, with shaving cream.
Boy, are you up a creek.
Come on.
Really, Carol,
don't say anything.
If you say,
"I was a dirty bird.
"Carol's not grungy.
She's bitching."
Oh.
Say it. I'll tell him.
I was a dirty bird.
Carol's not grungy.
She's bitching.
I'll think about it.
Where you going,
Milner?
Oh, I'm going home, sir.
Uh-huh.
Where've you been?
We were
at the movies, sir.
Milner,
you didn't happen
to be around
the corner of
about 8:30 tonight,
did you?
No. No, sir.
We were at the movies,
like I said.
Uh-huh.
Milner, the reason
I stopped you was
because the light on
your license plate's out.
I'm gonna have to
cite you for that.
And, Milner,
the front end
of this thing
you're driving
looks a little low.
Oh, no, sir.
It's 12 and a half inches,
regulation size.
Now, it's been
checked several times.
You can check it
if you like, sir.
Look, Milner.
Listen.
You can't fool
with the law.
Yes, sir.
We know that
was you tonight.
We have an excellent
description of this car.
I could run you in
right now,
and I could
make it stick.
But I'm not gonna
do that, Milner.
You know why?
I want to catch you
in the act,
and when I do,
I'm gonna nail you
but good.
Happy birthday, Milner.
Thank you,
asshole.
You're a regular J. D.
File that under C.S.
Over there.
C. S?
What's that stand for?
JOHN: Chicken shit.
That's what it is.
CAROL: Hah.
Ain't he neat?
Hey, you know
a guy around here
with a piss
yellow deuce coupe?
Supposed to
be hot stuff?
TERRY: What,
you mean John Milner?
Hey, nobody can
beat him, man.
He's got the fastest...
I ain't nobody, dork.
Right?
Right.
You see this Milner,
you tell him I'm looking
for him, huh?
Tell him I aim
to blow his ass
right off the road.
Ain't he neat?
What a babe.
What a bitching babe.
Hello.
Look, you sure
you don't need
a lift somewhere, huh?
Hey, you know
John Milner?
John Milner's
a good friend of mine.
Hey, did anybody
ever tell you
that you look just
like Connie Stevens?
You do.
I really mean it.
For real?
Yeah. I met her once
at a Dick Clark road show.
Yeah? You really
think I look like her?
Yeah, no shit.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mean that I'm not
just feeding you a line.
I really think you do.
You look like Connie Stevens.
What's your name?
Debbie.
You know, I always thought
I look like Sandra Dee.
Oh. Yeah, well,
you look a lot
like her, too.
Yeah, is this your car?
Yeah. I'm Terry the...
Well, they usually
call me Terry the Tiger.
Yeah? It's really
tough-looking.
What school you go to?
Dewey.
Can it lay rubber?
Yeah,
I got a 327 Chevy in it.
It's got six Strombergs.
That's bitching
tuck 'n' roll.
You know,
I really love the feel of
tuck 'n' roll upholstery.
You do? Well...
Yeah.
You know, come in.
I'll let you feel it.
I mean,
you can touch it
if you want.
I'll let you
feel the upholstery.
Okay.
Peel out.
What?
Peel out.
I just love it
when guys peel out.
And they came
all the way
from Stockton.
Let's hear it.
I don't care if you
leave this second.
And we wanna
thank Darby Langdon,
who did all these
neat decorations.
Now the next dance is
gonna be a snowball,
and leading it off
is last year's
class president,
Steve Bolander,
and this year's
head cheerleader,
Laurie Henderson.
Come on.
"Come on" what?
Oh, Steven, please.
Smile or something.
Quit pinching.
You think I care
if you go off?
You think I'm gonna
crack up or something?
Boy, are you conceited!
I don't know why
I ever asked you out
in the first place.
You didn't.
I asked you out.
What do you mean,
you asked me out?
Backwards Day.
Remember?
If I had waited
for you to ask me...
Oh, brother!
Even after that,
you didn't call me
for two weeks.
Well, I was busy.
You were scared.
Dave Ogler told me.
Then when you did
ask me out,
you didn't kiss me
for three dates.
Well, I was...
Scared.
Jim Kiler told me.
I even asked my father
why you hadn't kissed me.
Your father. Great.
You know what he said?
He said he thought
you were bright enough,
and that you'd probably
get around to it
after a while.
You didn't, of course.
I had to.
Remember the picnic?
Out at the canyon?
Oh, boy! You don't
remember anything,
do you?
The first one,
up at the lake.
That was the first time
you kissed me.
I had to practically
throw myself at you.
I remember.
What's wrong?
Go to hell.
What are you doing,
stealing hubcaps?
Well, hey, Wendy.
How've you been?
Fine.
Great.
How you been?
Wait a sec.
Wait a minute!
Bobbie Tucker.
She's got her car.
Heard you're
going away to school.
Maybe, maybe.
What?
Same old Curt.
All the time
we were going together,
you never knew
what you were doing.
GIRL: Hey, guys,
wait for me!
Well, I gotta go.
Well, where you going?
Nowhere.
Well, you mind
if I come along?
Okay.
All right, Bolander,
break that up.
You know the rules.
You and your girlfriend
wanna do that,
go someplace else, huh?
Hey, Kroot.
Why don't you
go kiss a duck?
What did you say?
I said go kiss a duck,
marble-head.
All right, Bolander,
you are suspended!
Don't you even
come in Monday.
You're out! You're out!
Kroot, Kroot...
I graduated last semester.
Remember?
Why don't we go
out to the canal?
What for?
Listen, I can get
tough with you, too,
you know.
Hard guy.
A double Chubby Chuck,
a Mexicali Chili-Barb,
two orders of
French fries and...
Cherry Coke.
And two Cherry Cokes.
Now wait a minute.
What? Huh?
Yeah, right. Cool.
Hey, Deb.
How's my soft baby?
Come on. Beat it, Vic.
I'm not your baby.
Oh, come on, honey.
Look, so I never
called you back.
I've been,
you know, busy.
Yeah, three weeks?
Besides, it only took me
one night to realize
if brains were dynamite,
you couldn't blow your nose.
Look who's talking.
Hey, who's the wimp
you're hanging out
with now? Einstein?
Tiger happens to
be very intelligent,
unlike you.
I know everything
your dirty little mind
is thinking. It shows.
Hey, now, buddy, look.
The lady obviously
doesn't wanna have to...
Look, creep. You want
a knuckle sandwich?
No, thanks.
I'm waiting for
a double Chubby Chuck.
Then keep your
smart-ass mouth shut.
Hey, I'll call you
sometime, Deb.
Some night
when I'm hard up.
I won't be home.
Get out of here.
Get out of here.
You seem to know
a lot of weird guys.
That creep's not
a friend of mine.
He's just horny.
That's why I like you.
You're different.
I am? I mean,
you really think
I'm intelligent?
Yeah. And I bet
you're smart enough
to get us some brew.
Yeah.
Brew?
Yeah.
Liquor.
Yeah.
Yeah, right, liquor.
Yeah, this place is
too crowded anyway.
What about your
double Chubby Chuck,
your Mexicali
Chili-Barb
and your two
Cherry Cokes, sir?
CURT: Will you speed up,
please?
BOBBIE: Quit shoving me.
You're gonna lose her.
Cut around him.
Just hang a right
at the corner.
Oh, lost her again.
Who is she?
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.
I know who she is.
Well, come on, Bob.
Come on, who is she?
Come on!
You know Mr. Beeman?
He owns Hepcat Jewelers.
Yeah.
That's his wife.
Get out of here.
That's ridiculous.
That girl is young
and beautiful.
And married.
And she was
cruising 10th Street.
You got to be thinking
of someone else.
Hey, did you know
that my ex is
going to become
a presidential aide?
Yeah, and it's a secret,
so don't tell anybody.
But his greatest ambition
is to shake hands
with President Kennedy.
How do you suppose
you're gonna do that,
wishy-washy, at JC?
Well, maybe I've grown up.
Maybe I changed my mind.
I doubt it.
I doubt it.
Maybe you don't
think you can do it.
Maybe you ought
to shut up.
Maybe I ought to.
But I won't.
Maybe you ought
to come into
the aft chamber.
Where we can
discuss this in private.
Thanks a lot.
Come on, Wendy.
Move over.
I'm not sitting
on your lap.
To the opera, James.
Drop dead.
Unless you want to
go to Gallo Dam
and have a little orgy.
You wish.
Oh, I could pick up
some oleomargarine,
roll around in it
for a while.
GIRL: Hey, you guys,
keep your mind
on the road.
I've been silly.
Oh, yeah?
I'm really glad
you're gonna stay.
We might even have
a class together.
Maybe.
BOBBIE: Look.
There's Kip Pullman.
He's so neat.
Look. Say something
to him when we go by.
What do you
want me to say?
Anything.
I just want to meet him.
CURT: Hey, Kip, buddy.
What's up?
Hey, Henderson.
Long time no see.
What you been doing?
Nothing, nothing.
I just wanted to tell you
that Bobbie here's
madly in love with you
and trembles at the sight
of your rippling biceps.
Out of my car, you...
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
I hate you!
Get out of my car!
Temper, temper!
Bye, Curt.
WOLFMAN ON RADIO:
Yes, found Barbara Ann.
Hey, this one is
for all you out there
watching the Submarine Races.
Here it is.
One 10-cent Coke with ice.
And don't take
all day drinking it.
Please.
Oh, rats. I thought
some of my friends
might be here.
Probably a couple of weeks
past their bedtime now.
Oh, wait.
There's Dee Dee.
I hope she sees me.
Shit. Dee Dee.
Hiya, John.
Oh.
JOHN: What do
you say, Al?
Not much.
Say, do you think
if I brought my Mopar
by the shop on Monday,
you could spot weld
the bumper bracket?
Sure. Anything.
Just come by before noon.
All right?
Sure.
Hey, you met Linda?
Fine.
No, no. Hi, Linda.
This is my cousin, Carol.
Carol, Linda. Al.
I'm babysitting tonight.
Babysitting?
JOHN: Yeah, Jesus!
Watch it, will you?
Been hitting me all night.
Kids will be kids, you know.
Hold on, God damn it.
Why don't you grow up,
for Christ's sake?
We don't
get along too well.
You know how it is.
It's been like this...
You spastic creep!
Hi, cousin.
How's your bod?
WOLFMAN ON RADIO:
Wolfman Top 40 is
Box 1300, Chula Vista.
Wolfman sweatshirts
is Wolf Enterprises,
Bakersfield.
Hi.
Excuse me, sir.
Yes, son?
I was wondering,
could you give me
the time?
Oh, sure.
It's 11:45.
Yeah. 11:45. Good.
Thanks a lot.
Okay.
Oh, excuse me, sir.
I got a problem.
See, I lost my I. D.
In a flood
and I was wondering,
since you're going
in there anyway,
could you pick me
some Old Harper?
Hard stuff?
Would you
buy me a bottle?
Why, certainly.
I lost my wife, too.
Her name wasn't Idy, though,
and it wasn't in a flood.
But I know what you...
Yeah, good.
Here's...
Here's some money.
Old Harper.
Great.
Hi.
Hi.
Right-o.
Yeah.
Good night.
Good night.
Hey, no.
Not wine. Hey.
Hi.
Hi.
Say, was there
an old man in here
a minute ago?
Yeah. Just went
out the back.
Want something?
Yeah.
Let me have...
Okay, yeah.
Let me have
a 3 Musketeers
and a ball-point pen,
one of those combs there,
a pint of Old Harper,
a couple of
flashlight batteries
and some beef jerky.
Okay. You got an I. D.
For the liquor?
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh, nuts.
I left it in the car.
Sorry. You'll have
to get it before...
Well, I...
I also...
I forgot the car.
Hey, did you get it?
You get it, you get it,
you get it?
You got it.
You got it.
You didn't get it.
Why didn't you get it?
Well, I...
I needed some things
and I thought,
as long as I was
in there...
Look, Debbie,
can you loan me a dollar?
Are you for real? Come on.
Girls don't pay. Guys pay.
Yeah. Well, see,
I've only got $50 and
he doesn't have change.
Wow. I can't
believe this.
I really
cannot believe this.
Here.
Hi, excuse me.
I'm wondering,
could you...
Buy you a bottle
of booze?
Yeah, I know.
You lost your I. D.
What kind do you want?
Gee, that's terrific.
Just some Old Harper.
Great.
That one over there,
that's Freddy Benson's
'vette.
Got his
in a head-on collision
with a drunk.
Boom!
Didn't have a chance.
He was a good driver, too.
It's pretty grim
when a guy gets it,
and it's not
even his own fault.
Needs a paint job,
that's for sure.
See that over there?
That '41?
That used to be,
believe it or not,
the fastest car
in the valley.
I never got a chance
to race Earl, though.
He got his in 1955 in
about the hairiest crash
we ever had here.
Jesus, you should
have seen it.
Eight kids killed
and both drivers.
The Board of Education
was real impressed,
see, so they come up,
film the whole thing.
Now they show it
in drivers'
education classes.
You'll probably see it
if you get lucky.
Course, it's pretty tough
when they take somebody
with them.
You never had
an accident, though.
You told me.
Yeah. Well,
I come mighty close.
I almost rolled it
a couple of times.
But I've been
just quick enough
to stay out
of this graveyard.
Bet you're the fastest.
I've never been beat.
A lot of guys tried.
Seems to me
there's more guys lately
than there's ever been.
WOLFMAN ON RADIO:
Sneaking around
with the Wolfman, baby.
Oh, this gonna
strike a raw nerve, Mama.
Here's The Platters.
What're you doing,
creep?
Who, me?
No. I'm talking
to the other
You know
Gil Gonzales?
Gil Gonzales?
No. No, I don't.
You don't know Gil?
Well, you ought to.
He's a friend of ours,
and that's his car
you've got your
butt parked on.
Hey, where are
you going?
Nowhere.
Well, you must be
going someplace.
I mean,
you left here,
didn't you?
Ants, bring him over here.
I want to show him something.
Here.
Bend down here.
Look across here.
You see?
Right across here.
You see?
Yeah?
Yeah, I guess so.
You scratched it, man.
Now, where do you get off
sitting on Gil's car?
Huh, man?
I'm sorry. It's really
not much of a scratch.
I don't think
you'd see it...
It ain't the size
that's in question here.
It's the principle.
The principle. Right.
Oh, jeez,
this is gonna be tough.
What should we
do with you?
Tie him to the car
and drag him.
You know Toby Juarez?
Toby Juarez,
he's a Pharaoh,
isn't he?
Toby Juarez?
Yeah, we know Toby.
We killed him
last night.
Tied him to the car
and...
Dragged him.
Right.
This is gonna
take some thinking.
You better come
with us, maybe.
Take a ride with
the Pharaohs. Huh?
No. Listen.
I'd really like to,
but I... I've got to...
I'd rather...
I'd rather...
I know
just how you feel.
CARLOS: Shotgun.
ANTS: No, I called it.
When?
Before we picked you up.
Man, you can't call it
for the whole night.
I got it now.
Get in the back, punk.
Will you get in there?
Jesus!
MAN ON RADIO:
Rock and roll
will stand, man.
WOLFMAN: Who is this on
the Wolfman telephone?
FEMALE OPERATOR ON RADIO:
Hello, it's collect.
WOLFMAN: Pardon me.
Your name is Collett?
OPERATOR: Yes.
Collect call for Wolf...
Your name
is Collett Call?
Sir, this is
the operator.
Are you French,
operator?
This is a collect call
for Wolfman Jack.
I... I love you,
operator.
Is this Wolfman Jack?
Is Floyd there?
It's for Wolfman Jack.
I just love
listening to Wolfman.
My mom won't
let me at home.
Because he's a negro.
I think he's terrific.
Do you know that
he just broadcasts
from a plane that
flies around in circles
all the time?
Do you believe
that's true?
WOLFMAN: Floyd,
I love you, Floyd.
Floyd,
is this you, Floyd?
Floyd,
I cannot look on thee,
love took my hand
and smiling did reply,
who made the eyes but I?
Floyd, reach out,
touch my soul, Floyd.
OPERATOR: Your
party's ready, sir.
Hello, Floyd!
WOMAN: Matilda?
Bye!
You tell her, Wolfman.
He's my man.
When I graduate,
I'm gonna be a Wolfman.
Hey, you know,
he broadcasts out
of Mexico someplace?
No, he don't.
I've seen the station
right outside of town.
CARLOS: That's just
a clearing station, man,
so he can fool the cops.
He blasts that thing
all the way around
the world.
It's against
the law, man.
Oh, man, they'll never
catch Wolfman.
CARLOS: No way.
Hey, man,
who cut the cheese?
JOE: He who smelt it,
dealt it.
There's that
badass Chevy again.
Oh, look at that snatch
he's got with him.
Man, he looks
like a wimp.
Probably is.
Wimps get all the snatch.
Milner ain't
gonna beat that.
His time has come.
He's getting old.
He ain't as fast
as he used to be.
You got just two seconds
to get your ass over
in your corner.
Don't worry,
I won't rape you.
GIRL: Hey.
You got a bitching car.
Yeah, I know.
In fact,
your car's so neat,
we're gonna give
you our special prize.
You want me
to give it to you?
Sweetheart,
if the prize is you,
I'm a ready teddy.
Well, get bent, turkey.
Very funny.
What a chop.
Quit laughing.
Let's catch them
at the light,
then you jump out
and flatten their tires.
Wait a minute.
Just do what I say.
All right, boss.
Wow, it's a really
beautiful night tonight.
It's a perfect night
for horseback riding.
I was going with a guy
who had horses once.
Oh, yeah?
I had a couple
of horses myself.
Really?
Mmm.
I used them for hunting.
I do a lot of hunting,
you know.
Yeah. Deer, mostly.
Got a couple of
bear last year.
Yeah, those were
good ponies.
Had to train
them special myself.
Took a lot of time.
Yeah?
Do you still have them?
We can go for a ride.
No. No.
I had to sell them
to get these wheels.
And a Jeep.
I got a Jeep pickup
with four-wheel drive.
It's got a gun rack on it,
and I use that
for hunting mostly.
Why do you kill
little animals?
I think that's terrible.
Oh, well, yeah,
I figure with bears,
though, it's me or them.
You know, I think
you're really neat.
Wait a second.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.
I don't know, I guess,
maybe it's the booze
or something.
I don't know.
DEBBIE: Ouch!
You pinched me!
I'm sorry.
Let me get
my head over here.
Okay, you get up.
Okay.
TERRY: This is...
Ow! My leg, my leg.
Ow! Watch it!
DEBBIE: Mmm. I just love
tuck 'n' roll upholstery.
Jeez. It's like
Grand Central Station
around here.
Why don't we go
someplace else?
No, come on.
They won't come back.
Wait a minute.
I got a blanket
in the back.
Why don't we go over
into the field?
All right.
Okay. Okay.
Oh.
WOLFMAN ON RADIO: Hello.
GIRL: Yeah.
How old are you?
I'm 13,
how old are you?
I'm only 14.
Oh, boy,
I love you, Wolfman.
Now we gonna
do the weather
for all the valleys
and the mountain tops.
Gonna be hot.
About 200 degrees in Merced,
and I know
we're gonna have
about 500 degrees
up around the valley
there somewhere.
You got
The Wolfman Jack Show.
Hey, now, this is terrific.
See, I love miniature golf.
Is that right?
I hate it.
Well, I don't play
it too often anyway.
What are we doing here?
We're out of gas, man.
CURT: They don't...
They don't sell gas here.
I know.
But we're out
of money, too.
Ha!
Hey! Hey. What are
you punks doing?
What's going on here?
Why, just...
Hey, hi, Mr. Gordon.
What's up?
Henderson?
Curt Henderson,
are you with
these punks?
These are just
some friends of mine.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. We're just,
you know...
Oh.
Well, you had me
nervous there
for a second, huh?
Yeah?
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, you didn't
leave yet, huh?
Oh, no, I'm not...
I'm not scheduled
to leave until
tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow? Oh.
Hey, Hank Anderson's inside.
Come on in and say goodbye.
Huh?
You know,
he brought your name up
at the Moose Hall.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
You got the check,
didn't you?
Uh-huh.
Hey, Hank,
look who's here.
Well, well.
Well, well, well.
Well, well,
how are you, Curt?
What a pleasant surprise.
Congratulations, my boy.
We're all proud of you.
All of us.
You know,
the Moose Scholarship
went to the right boy. You.
And we're all
proud of you.
Hey.
We're all done out here.
All done?
What's he mean?
He means
we're all done having
loads of fun out here.
Oh, well...
Wonderful.
Yes.
You can have all
the fun you want.
This place is for fun.
Yes, it is.
Thank you.
Thank you both.
Good luck now.
Curt,
before I say goodbye,
I hope you'll be
taking along with you
a little piece
of this place.
I think I have.
Good.
Don't forget us.
No, I won't forget you
and you won't forget me.
Okay. Bye-bye.
Okay.
Goodbye
and good luck.
Bye now.
Bye.
Bye.
It was nice
to meet you.
Right. What he said
goes for me, too.
Yeah, you just
might make it as
a Pharaoh yet, boy.
Someday he'll
make a fine Moose.
DEBBIE:
What's the matter?
TERRY: The radio's gone.
Yeah?
That means
the car is gone!
Come on.
Oh, God!
Not the car!
Oh, no! Anything!
Not the car!
You know,
it doesn't make sense
to leave home
to look for home.
To give up a life
to find a new life.
To say goodbye
to friends you love
just to find new friends.
Wait a minute.
Could you say
that again?
Something Curt said.
Mmm. Figures.
You must've talked
his ear off trying
to get him to stay.
Oh, no, Steven.
That's not true at all.
I didn't say anything.
Curt just said
at dinner tonight
that he didn't see
what the big hurry was.
He thought that he ought
to stick around and go
to JC for a while,
and try and figure out
what he wanted to
do with his life.
That sounds logical.
Do you think so?
Sure.
I think Curt's
probably right,
for Curt.
Not for me though.
Laurie, look at me.
Now, you know what
I want out of life,
and it's just not
in this town.
I'm not going with you
to the airport tomorrow.
No, Steven, don't.
Come on.
No.
It's our
last night together
for three months.
I know.
But we've been
through this before.
I'm gonna
miss you so much.
I need something
to remember you by.
You don't want me to
forget you, do you?
No.
Well, what's wrong?
You're just sitting there.
Well, you want to.
Go ahead.
Not like that.
If you're not
gonna remember me
for anything else,
why don't you
just go ahead?
Oh, come on,
you want it
and you know it.
Don't be so damn
self-righteous with me,
after all that
stuff you told me about
watching your brother.
You're disgusting.
Get out of my car.
Get out!
Laurie.
I told you never
to mention that.
So, anyhows,
the Goat Killer...
Can't we talk
about something else?
No.
Whenever he strikes,
he leaves
a bloody goat's head
next to the victim.
Isn't that creepy?
They thought he
went up to Stockton,
but two nights ago
they found the bodies
of Carlie Johnson
and Don White
right here at this canal,
all hacked to pieces.
Who do you think
will take the regionals
this year?
Not only were there
bloody goats' heads
all around,
but he had, like,
switched parts
of their bodies.
She had on his arms
and he had
on her legs and...
Wait a second!
Wait a second!
Did you hear that?
Do you think it's
the Goat Killer?
No!
I mean, no.
Listen,
I'll go for help
and you stay here.
No, let's get
in this field.
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on!
Maybe if it's
the Goat Killer,
he'll get somebody
and we'll see
the whole thing.
I don't want to
see the whole thing!
I gotta see what
he's doing though.
Darn it,
I wish I could see.
I can't see anything.
I don't wanna
see anything.
Just keep him
away from me.
That's all I want.
How do I get
into these things?
We're all right up...
Debbie?
Debbie?
Oh, no!
Please! Please!
STEVE: Terry.
Steve!
What are you
doing up here?
Steve.
Oh, God, Steve.
DEBBIE: Hey,
is it safe to come out?
Where did you go,
anyway?
Over there.
Don't do that. Come on.
Let's get out of here.
STEVE: Where's my rod?
TERRY: Your rod?
STEVE: Yeah.
TERRY: Oh.
Did I introduce you?
This is Debbie.
Debbie, this is Steve.
DEBBIE: Hello.
STEVE: Hi.
DEBBIE: Hi.
STEVE: Well?
It's in the garage.
I put it in the garage
for safekeeping.
I mean...
I mean,
I don't want to take
any chances with it.
Yeah.
Oh, great.
Yeah.
It's a good thing, too,
because somebody
stole our car.
STEVE: Really?
That's terrible.
DEBBIE: Yeah.
What kind was it?
TERRY: Gee,
where's Laurie anyway?
STEVE: I guess
we broke up.
TERRY: You broke up? Bull.
Doesn't look like
a gearshift knob.
What is it?
Come on, will you?
Give it back to me.
What's wrong?
You're a tough guy.
Go ahead and cream me.
Break my arm.
See if I care.
I was just gonna keep it
for a little while.
You're an ogre,
just like my father.
He won't let me
stay out late or
play records or anything.
Your father won't
let you stay out late?
No, he's terrible.
Once I was at a party and
it didn't end until late.
He called the cops.
Can you imagine?
He had the whole
police force there.
By the way, where is it
that you live, Carol?
Over on Ramona. Why?
Oh, no!
Uh-uh.
You thought I'd
tell you where I live?
Not me. Not old Carol.
The night is young,
and I'm not hitting the rack
till I get a little action.
What do you
keep looking at?
Who's that?
You know him?
He's following
awful close.
Grab on to something.
Hey, man, I'm sorry
if I scared you.
You'd have to do
a hell of a lot more
than that to scare me.
Hey, I've been looking
all over for you, man.
Didn't nobody tell you
I was looking for you?
Hey, I can't keep track
of all you punks
running around here
backwards.
Hey, you're supposed to
be the fastest thing
in the valley, man.
But that can't be your car.
It must be your mama's car.
I'm sort of embarrassed
to be this close to you.
Well, I'm not surprised,
driving a field car.
Field car?
What's a field car?
A field car runs
through the fields,
drops cow shit
all over the place
to make the lettuce grow.
That's pretty good.
Hey, I like the color
of your car there, man.
What's that supposed to be?
Sort of a cross
between piss yellow
and puke green, ain't it?
You call that a paint job,
but it's pretty ugly.
I'll bet you got to
sneak up on the pumps
just to get
a little air
in your tires.
At least I don't have
to pull over to the side
just to let
a funeral go by, man.
Oh! Funny.
You know what?
Your car's uglier
than I am!
That didn't
come out right.
Come on, boy.
Let's go. Prove it.
Why don't you go out
and try to win yourself
a few races?
Then you come on back
and I'll show you
a few things.
Oh, race him.
You can beat him.
Hey,
that's a tough-looking girl
you got with you, man.
What are you doing?
Trying to pick up
a few extra bucks
babysitting?
Hey, doll,
why don't you come on
and ride with me,
in about 10 years?
Now, leave her
out of this.
This is just
between you and me.
Wow. He's really fast,
isn't he?
Yeah, but he's stupid.
Any of you guys
know a blonde
in a white T-Bird?
I know her.
What about it?
I'm trying to find out,
you know, who she is.
She's out of
your price range, man.
My brother's
been out with her.
He clued me in...
Price range?
Are you trying
to tell me
that she's a prost...
That's right,
she's a $30 Sheri.
Jesus. Can you imagine that?
Thirty bucks for that broad.
We got to
be thinking about
two different broads.
Hey, watch it.
Fuzz ahead.
Where?
At Jerry's Cherry.
You can just
barely see the fender.
JOE: Yeah.
We ought to
do something.
I got an idea.
I got a good idea.
I think I'm gonna go
over to Burger City.
Yeah. Yeah, Laurie's
probably over there.
You really think
she's got me worried
about where she is,
don't you?
Well,
let me tell you something.
I couldn't care less.
Want to come along?
Yeah, I do.
I do. I do.
No.
Well, make up
your minds.
No, thanks. We got to
report the car missing.
All right.
I'll see you.
Yeah. See you.
Shut up!
They'll hear us.
Listen, Carl...
Curt.
Curt.
Curt.
Despite you scratching
Gil's car, I like you.
And I know what
you'd like more
than anything right now.
Like every guy
in this town,
you got the same
secret dream, right?
You wanna be
a Pharaoh, huh.
Go ahead.
You can admit it.
But you didn't think
it was possible,
did you? Huh?
Well, tonight,
I'm gonna give
you your chance.
Get down.
Okay.
Now, you got it?
I'm staying here.
You're on your own.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Joe.
Wait a minute.
What if he hears me?
Listen, listen!
Look at it this way.
Now, you got
three choices.
One, you chicken out.
In that case,
I let Ants tie you
to the car
and drag you
around a bit.
And you don't
want that, right?
No.
Two, you foul up
and Holstein
hears you, and, well,
you don't
want that, right?
No, I don't.
Three, you are successful
and you join the Pharaohs
with a car coat and
a blood initiation
and all that, huh.
What? Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What blood initiation?
Hey, why don't we
go get your Jeep?
What? What are
you talking about?
You know, your Jeep.
The one you sold
the hunting ponies for,
the one with
the four-wheel drive.
JOE: Hey, you sure
you got enough slack?
CURT: Yeah, yeah, no sweat.
Let's get out of here.
Come on, Terry.
Terry?
Stand by for justice!
WOLFMAN ON RADIO:
I can't believe it.
Feeling so good
'cause you're 16.
Why are we
stopping here?
Carol.
What?
I...
I don't think that
I can control myself
any longer tonight.
You can't?
No.
I've got to have you.
Me?
Yeah.
All night you've
been sitting there,
and you've been so sexy,
and it's been
so hot out here,
and I can't
wait any longer.
You've been so...
Well, a lot of that
was an act, you know.
Like my crying.
It was just an act.
Yeah? It's been
building up inside of me
like a volcano all night.
And if you told me
where you lived,
well, then I could
take you home,
but you won't tell me
where you live,
so here we are.
I mean,
I've got to have you.
It's too late.
It's not too late!
It's never too late!
Two-three-one.
Two-three-one.
I'll show you.
It's easy to find.
Hi, Steve.
Mind if I sit down?
Oh, hi. No.
Have a seat.
Just got five minutes off
and I saw you here
all alone, for once.
Where's Laurie?
I don't know.
I thought you guys
would be together,
I mean,
this being
your last night
and everything...
We broke up.
What?
It's no big deal.
It's no big deal at all.
Why? What happened?
MAN: Budda,
you got an hour left.
Let's get on it.
All right, all right,
you old fart! Relax!
Hey, listen,
I'm gonna get off
in an hour,
and I thought
you'd maybe like
to come over.
I don't know.
Well, why not?
...this time,
it'd just be for fun.
Okay?
Well...
Okay. I'll see
you later, then.
Budda. Budda, wait.
Yeah?
Listen, I...
I gotta get up early
in the morning
and I just don't
think it'd work out.
What a glorious night, huh?
That was the bitching-est
thing I ever seen
in my whole life.
Whoo!
Boy, I'll tell
you something,
that thing jumped about
five feet in the air...
Listen, I still got
some things to do.
I got to find
that blonde.
Yeah, anyway,
catch you tomorrow night.
I guess so.
I don't know.
What do you mean,
you guess so?
Listen, we don't
admit a lot of guys
to the Pharaohs.
Right.
I mean,
you understand?
We got to
steal you a car coat
and things like that.
You got to
make up your mind.
Rome wasn't
burned in a night.
Well, let's go!
I'll see you, boys.
Yeah.
WOLFMAN ON RADIO:
My, my, my.
You only got about
five minutes left
if you want to
talk to the Wolfman.
Gonna make all your dreams
come true, baby. Hello!
MAN ON RADIO: Wolfman.
WOLFMAN: Yeah.
Would you
dedicate a record
to keep me and
my girlfriend together?
Are you separated?
Well, see, we're
having a little problem.
I'll bring you
right together.
Hold on a minute, man.
Everything's gonna
be all right now, man.
You understand?
I chased
the evil spirits away.
Now let me play
the record for you.
Hey, hey, hey, baby.
What do you say?
Don't say anything
and we'll get along
just fine.
Well, this is the first time
you've been quiet all night.
I had fun. Goodbye.
Bye.
Do you like me?
Yeah, I like you.
You're all right.
But I mean,
do you like me?
Yeah...
I like you.
Okay?
Couldn't I have something
to remember you by?
Bye, kid.
Gee, thanks!
It's just like
a ring or something.
Yeah.
It's like we
were going steady.
Wait till I tell Marcia.
Wait a minute, now.
Wait till
I tell everybody!
Don't go overboard
with this thing.
Well, I'll see you around.
WOLFMAN ON RADIO:
I've been crying so much.
And the tears
and everything, man.
I leaned down
towards the microphone,
I almost shorted myself out.
Hold that up.
You're right
about that.
But why should
I leave home
to find a home?
You know, why should
I leave friends
that I love to
find new friends?
Wait a minute,
wait a minute,
wait a minute,
wait a minute.
I've heard this already.
Aren't you the one
that told me
for eight weeks
that you have to
leave the nest sometime?
I realize that.
I realize that.
No. No realizing.
You've been
telling me all summer
that it's time to
stick your head
out of the sand
and take a look at
the big, beautiful world
out there somewhere.
But...
Give me this thing.
I don't know, I...
I feel like a midwife.
I may have been wrong, Curt.
I may have been wrong.
Wrong, nothing.
You've been telling me
for eight weeks.
God damn it.
Yeah, I know.
You're just mentally
playing with yourself.
Just relax and
we'll talk about it
at the airport.
Where are you going?
It's awfully early
in the morning.
I have
a dental appointment.
Come on, Curt.
Just relax, will you?
I'll see you
at the airport.
He mustn't have
been used to drinking.
No. He likes to drink.
He told me so.
I knew a man once
who got that sick.
Billy Weber.
That was 10 years ago.
WOMAN: Being on his hands
and knees like that,
he looks like a dog,
doesn't he?
He looks
like Old Ginger.
Sicker than a dog,
that's for sure.
DEBBIE:
Are you all right?
Oh, rats.
Oh, I feel terrible.
The car!
Debbie, look!
DEBBIE: What?
Debbie,
that's the car!
Hey, look,
it's sitting right here.
Are you sure
this is it?
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
This is it. This is it.
They must've taken
the keys with them.
Well, maybe we better
go call the police.
No. No. Wait a minute.
I got a better idea.
We'll just steal it
right back, all right?
Now, you get some wire.
We need about a foot.
We can hotwire it.
Okay?
Took the
header plugs off, eh?
Expecting some action?
Yeah, I think so.
There's some punk
looking for me.
Why in the hell
do they bother?
You've been number one
as long as I can remember.
Yeah.
Been a long time,
ain't it?
I'll see you. Thanks.
WOLFMAN ON RADIO:
Who is this on
the Wolfman telephone?
Hi, this is my car.
What I mean is,
somebody stole my...
No, I mean,
I lost my car, see?
And I want to
thank you two guys
for finding it.
I mean, listen.
Now, listen, guys.
I've been sick recently,
and this kind of activity
can really be
hard on a guy.
Now, easy, would you?
Easy. Easy.
Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!
Help! Help! Police!
Stop! Stop it,
you creeps!
TERRY: Come on. No.
JOHN: Stop! Hey!
Stop it!
TERRY: Go, John!
DEBBIE: Get him!
Come on, get up!
Come on!
What the hell's
going on here, Toad?
Hey, man,
are you all right?
Yeah, I'll die soon and
it'll all be over, John.
Wow, you're just
like The Lone Ranger!
Yeah, yeah.
Listen,
are you with him?
Yeah.
You're talking to
the woman I love.
What happened, man?
Hi, Steve.
Hi, Judy. Hi, Karen.
Where's Laurie?
Well, we know
where she is.
So what?
So nothing.
Just that she was
with a really cute guy
in a really boss car,
and we thought
you just might
know who it was.
I'm sorry,
but I wouldn't know.
We know.
His name's Bob Falfa.
MAN ON INTERCOM: Yes?
Help. No...
Bring two Cherry Cokes
with lots of ice.
No, never mind. Forget...
Just bring the ice.
Pronto.
Out. Out.
Get out of the car.
Hey!
Steve,
what are you doing?
Get out.
Just get out
and shut up.
You, too.
Get out. Get out!
TERRY: What's going on?
I don't know,
but I'm about
to find out.
I can't believe it.
You practically
get killed trying
to get your car back
and then you
let him have it.
It's not my car.
What?
It is not my car.
Well, then,
where is your car?
I don't have a car.
Well, what about
your Jeep?
Well, how am I
gonna get home?
Where's your car?
I have to hang them
on a car.
I need a ride.
Hey, Toad,
what happened
to you, man?
Did you lose
your car again?
No, Steve took it.
I want to go to sleep.
WOLFMAN ON RADIO: You got to
take it easy when you drive
that car of yours.
You've got to
cruise easy, baby.
Don't be
doing any accidents
or anything on me now.
You know, Terry?
I had a pretty
good time tonight.
Oh, come on.
You're just...
No, no.
Really, really.
I really
had a good time.
I mean, you picked me up
and we got some hard stuff,
and saw a holdup,
and then we went
to the canal.
You got
your car stolen.
And then, I got to
watch you getting sick.
And then,
you got in this
really bitching fight.
I really
had a good time.
Yeah, well, I guess
I have a pretty good time
just about every night.
Well, if I'm not
doing anything tomorrow,
why don't you
give me a call, okay?
Yeah, all right.
I got a little Vespa
that I just kind of
play around with.
Maybe, you know, we...
Really? Well,
that's almost a motorcycle,
and I just love motorcycles.
You do?
Why didn't you say
something earlier?
We wouldn't have had to
go through all the fun.
I gotta go.
Ow.
Good night.
See you.
Hey, what do you want?
Push the red switch down.
I'm looking
for this girl.
Yeah. Aren't we all?
She's not here.
Come on in the back.
You just go
around the back.
Thank you.
This way.
Hey.
Have a popsicle.
The icebox just broke down
and they're melting
all over the place.
You want one?
No, no. No thanks.
Listen...
Have a popsicle.
Are you the Wolfman?
No, man.
I'm not the Wolfman.
Wait a minute.
WOLFMAN ON TAPE:
Who is this on
the Wolfman's telephone?
GIRL ON TAPE: Diane.
How're you doing,
Diane?
That's the Wolfman.
Do you love me?
He's on tape.
The man
is on tape. Well...
Where is he now?
I mean,
where does he work?
The Wolfman
is everywhere.
Well, I gotta give
him this note. Shit!
GIRL: Can I wizz
on you, Wolfman?
Here, let me
see the note.
Hell, that's just
a dedication, man.
What I can do
is I relay it.
It'll be on
tomorrow or Tuesday.
No, no. See,
this is very important.
You see, I may be
leaving town tomorrow
and it's very
important that I...
Damn it. That I reach
this girl right now.
You don't know
whether you're gonna
leave town or not?
Well, I'm supposed
to go to college
back east tomorrow,
and I don't know
if I'm gonna go.
I don't know.
Wait a minute.
Have a popsicle.
Have a...
Huh?
No. No, thanks.
Sit down a minute.
It's early
in the morning.
Damn.
I can't talk
for the Wolfman,
but I can tell you
one thing.
If the Wolfman
was here, he'd say,
"Get your ass in gear."
The Wolfman comes
in here occasionally
bringing tapes, you know,
to check up on me
and whatnot.
And the places
he talks about
that he's been,
the things he's seen.
It's a great, big,
beautiful world out there.
And here I sit,
sucking on popsicles.
Why don't you leave?
I'm not
a young man anymore.
And the Wolfman
gave me my start
in the business,
and I like it.
I tell you what.
If I can possibly
do it tonight,
I'll try to relay
this dedication in
and get it on the air
for you later on.
That would be terrific.
Really. Thanks.
Just a minute.
Hey, it's been
a pleasure, really.
Thanks a lot.
I appreciate it.
Sticky little mothers,
ain't they?
They really...
Six or seven
of them, right?
I know. I got a whole
refrigerator full.
Thanks a lot.
Appreciate it.
See you later.
Rock on, baby.
We gonna do it
right here.
Rock and roll
yourself to death.
Oh, mercy!
Give me some more!
My, my.
Hey, John,
let me go with you.
Come on.
No, man,
I can't take you when
I'm racing somebody.
Oh, come on.
Just let me go.
I just want to watch.
Or I'll flag you, okay?
All right. Go ahead.
Paradise Road.
All right, now where's
this Paradise Road?
Just follow this street
straight out of town.
Listen, if you're
gonna race John Milner,
you can let me out
right when we get there.
Why don't you
shut up, baby?
You ain't said
one word all night long.
You're a weird broad.
But you're gonna
appreciate me soon.
You're gonna be
hanging on for mercy
when I get this
sucker rolling.
Heading out
to Paradise Road?
Paradise Road?
Some guy named Falfa's
going up against Milner.
He's racing Falfa?
Yeah.
Figured something's up.
Saw them head out of
town real cautious-like
and then...
WOLFMAN ON RADIO: That's
Heart and Soul, baby.
Hey, I got a dedication here
that's for a friend
of the old Wolfman,
and he wants me to
play the next song
for a blonde young lady
in a Thunderbird,
a white T-Bird,
you understand.
Now, my friend's name
is Curt,
and he wants to talk
to you out there, baby.
So you meet him
at Burger City,
or you can phone
Diamond 3132.
Now, he's a friend
of mine, you hear,
and little girl,
you better call him
or the Wolfman
gonna get you.
Hey, Laurie,
what in the hell are
you doing in there?
Is she gonna ride
with you?
Mind your
own business, John.
Yeah, she's going
with me.
You take care
of yourself, man.
You guys ready?
STEVE: Milner,
you son of a bitch!
Laurie. Laurie.
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
Laurie. Laurie.
JOHN: Come on,
she's gonna blow.
No, no, no.
Please, don't come
near me. No, please.
I'm gonna be sick.
Steven.
Oh, Steven!
Steven, please,
don't leave me.
Don't leave me,
Steven.
I won't.
I couldn't bear it.
Please.
I won't.
I'm not
gonna leave you.
I promise.
Do you?
I'm not
gonna leave you.
TERRY: Oh, that was
beautiful, John.
Just beautiful. Huh?
I was losing, man.
What?
He had me, man.
He was pulling away
from me
just before
he crashed.
You're crazy.
You saw it.
No, you creamed him
from right off the line.
The guy never
had a chance.
Shit, Toad!
The man had me!
He was beating me!
John, I don't know
what you're
talking about.
It was the most
beautiful thing
I ever seen.
That guy,
he might as well...
He can get a wheelchair
and roll himself home.
Man, you got
the bitching-est car
in the valley.
You'll always be
number one, John.
You're the greatest.
Yeah.
Huh?
Look at
your glasses, man.
Okay, Toad.
We'll take them all.
Right.
We'll take them.
Let's get out of here.
Jesus, what a night!
Hello? Hello? Hello?
GIRL ON PHONE: Curt?
Yes! Yes.
This is Curt.
Who are you?
Who were you expecting?
Do you drive
a white T-Bird?
A white '56.
I saw you
on Third Street.
Whoo!
Curt?
Who are you?
Do you know me?
Of course!
How do you know me?
It's not important.
It's important!
It's important to me!
You're the most
beautiful, exciting thing
I've ever seen in my life,
and I don't know
anything about you.
Listen, listen, listen,
could we meet
someplace?
I cruise Third Street.
Maybe I'll see
you tonight.
No, I don't think so.
Curt.
Tell me your name.
At least tell me
your name.
Goodbye, Curt.
Wait a minute!
Wait a second!
Little kiss on your ear.
Good night, sweetheart.
I'll see you later.
The Spaniels.
Goodbye, Son.
Call us when
you get there.
I'll miss you.
Mmm.
Good luck.
Yeah, same to you.
Am I gonna see
you there next year?
Oh, yeah,
I'll be there.
Yeah?
Bye-bye, Curt.
Well, stay cool, man.
And don't do anything
I wouldn't do.
I'll see you, buddy.
I know, you probably
think you're a big shot,
going off like this.
But you're still a punk.
Okay, John.
So long. So long.
See you.
We'll see you.
LAURIE: Bye, Curt.
See you later.
JOHN: Right.
TERRY: Have a good trip.
Curt!
Bye, Curt.
Bye.
