Man's voice:
-
-
-
-
-  - THE REPAIRED AX
SITS UNDISTURBED IN YOUR HOUSE
- UNTIL THE NEXT SPRING WHEN
ONE RAINY MORNING... -
-
-
THAT'S THE AX THAT SLAYED ME.
Man's voice:
Man's voice:
-
WHAT, DID YOU
DOZE OFF THERE?
HEY, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE ARNIE, RIGHT?
ARNIE BLONDESTONE.
SORRY I'M LATE.
YOU DON'T LOOK ASIAN,
MR. WONG.
I'M NOT.
I WAS BORN RIGHT HERE.
HAD MY LAST NAME CHANGED THOUGH.
THOUGHT IT'D MAKE ME HARDER TO FIND.
YOU KNOW THAT WONG IS THE MOST
COMMON SURNAME IN THE WORLD?
MMM. IS YOUR FAMILY
STILL AROUND?
NO, I WAS ADOPTED.
I NEVER KNEW MY REAL DAD.
YOU COULD BE MY DAD
FOR ALL I KNOW.
ARE YOU MY DAD?
UH...
I DON'T THINK SO, NO.
ANYWAY, MY ADOPTED FAMILY
MOVED AWAY.
I WON'T TELL YOU
WHERE THEY WENT, BUT...
GET OUT YOUR PEN,
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA WANNA WRITE THIS DOWN.
MUST'VE BEEN HARD.
SHE WAS A STRUNG-OUT,
CRANK-ADDICTED CANNIBAL,
BLEW HER WELFARE CHECK
EVERY MONTH ON BLACK CANDLES.
REALLY? AND I THOUGHT
MY MOM WAS BAD
BECAUSE SHE WOULDN'T
LET ME WATCH "SPACE GHOST."
- YOU PULLING MY LEG?
- NO, THIS IS JUST WHAT I DO WHEN I GET NERVOUS.
UM, SHE WAS BIPOLAR,
THAT'S ALL.
- I THINK YOU SHOULD USE THAT.
- I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO GET THE TRUTH OUT,
YOUR SIDE OF IT.
IF NOT, WHAT ARE WE EVEN
DOING HERE, MR. WONG?
YOU'RE RIGHT. SORRY.
SO YOU GUYS ARE--
YOU'RE WHAT?
YOU'RE SOME KIND
OF SPIRITUALISTS?
EXORCISTS?
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
Dave's voice:
-
Man on TV:

-
Man:
Man #2:
- HELLO?
-
David's voice:
JOHN, IT'S 3:00
IN THE MORNING, MAN.
John:
- JOHN.
-
David's voice:
- FOR "STOP AND PICK ME UP SOME
BEER ON THE WAY." -
-
DAVE. COME IN.
DAVE, THIS IS SHELLY.
SHE NEEDS OUR HELP.
SO, SHELLY,
TELL US YOUR STORY.
IT'S MY BOYFRIEND.
HE WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE.
HE'S BEEN HARASSING ME
FOR THE PAST WEEK.
I'M TERRIFIED TO GO HOME.
- MISS...
- MORRIS.
MISS MORRIS,
I'D STRONGLY RECOMMEND
A WOMEN'S SHELTER.
-
HAS BEEN DEAD
FOR TWO MONTHS.
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO GO.
I HEARD THROUGH A FRIEND
THAT YOU GUYS HANDLE...
UNUSUAL PROBLEMS.
SHELLY, WHEN HE COMES,
YOU CAN SEE HIM?
YES, AND I CAN HEAR HIM.
- HE HITS YOU?
- MAN, WHAT A DICK!
SHELLY, IN OUR EXPERIENCE,
SPIRITUAL BEINGS THAT
CAN MANIPULATE OBJECTS
IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD
ARE RARE.
UH, LOOK, MISS MORRIS,
I REALLY DON'T THINK--
I TOLD HER THAT WE'D
LOOK INTO THIS TONIGHT.
I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE
YOU AND I COULD GO OVER THERE
AND SHOW THIS BASTARD
WHAT'S WHAT.
John: SO WHERE DO YOU SEE HIM MOSTLY?
IN THE BASEMENT.
AND ONCE IN THE BATHROOM
WHEN I WAS ON THE TOILET,
- HE STUCK HIS HAND THROUGH THE SEAT ONCE.
- OKAY, JUST--
JUST SHOW US
THE BASEMENT DOOR.
IT'S THAT WAY.
-
- HE'S NOT HERE.
- BIG SURPRISE.
SHE SEEMS LIKE
A NICE GIRL, DOESN'T SHE?
WHEN SHE CAME TO MY DOOR TONIGHT I
ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS HER FOR A SECOND.
OH, BY THE WAY, DAVE,
I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR COMING ALONG.
I'M NOT SAYING I'M GONNA TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF HER DISTRESS OR ANYTHING, BUT...
-
- David: AW, JEEZ.
OOH.
GUY MUST'VE BEEN
A HUNTER.
WAIT. JOHN.
DID I HEAR YOU SAY THAT YOU THOUGHT
THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE AMBER?
- YEAH.
- JOHN, AMBER'S ALMOST AS TALL AS ME.
LIKE, JUST UNDER SIX FEET,
BLONDE HAIR, KINDA TOP-HEAVY.
YEAH, I KNOW.
SHE'S CUTE AS HELL, RIGHT?
YEAH, AND YOU THINK
THAT SHELLY LOOKS LIKE HER?
- THE GIRL SITTING UPSTAIRS?
- YEAH.
JOHN, SHELLY'S SHORT.
SHORT WITH DARK HAIR,
BLUE EYES.
GOD DAMN IT.
I KNEW SHE WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.
UH, SHELLY.
JOHN AND I ARE HAVING
A BIT OF A PROBLEM HERE.
WE'RE BOTH SEEING COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF YOU.
NOW JOHN HERE
HAS EYESIGHT PROBLEMS
'CAUSE OF HIS CONSTANT MASTURBATION,
BUT I DON'T THINK--
-
-
OH! GOD!
AH! OH!
AH! AH! OH.
- THAT DOOR CANNOT BE OPENED!
- NO.
THEY LOVE TO PLAY GAMES,
DON'T THEY?
- IT'S ALL THEY HAVE TIME FOR.
-
YOU DISAPPOINT ME.
ALL THESE YEARS WE'VE DUELED.
YOU WILL NEVER
DEFEAT ME, MARCONI.
WAIT, DR. ALBERT MARCONI?
THE GUY WHO HOSTS
THE MAGICAL MYSTERY SHOW
ON THE CULTURE CHANNEL?
DUMBASS. MARCONI?
MARCONI'S LIKE
THEY GUY'S GOT WHITE HAIR.
WE'RE NOT YOUR NEMESIS.
OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT-- IF WE CAN
GET YOU IN TOUCH WITH MARCONI
SO YOU TWO CAN WORK OUT YOUR LITTLE
DIFFERENCES, WILL YOU RELEASE US?
- YOU LIE!
- NO NO NO, WE'RE IN THE SAME BUSINESS.
- WE GOT A DIRECT LINE. HERE.
-
-
- YES?
-
Man on TV:
-
-
- HELLO, DOCTOR.
-
UH, YEAH, JOHN IS FEELING BETTER.
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.
I'M AFRAID WE HAVE
A SITUATION 53 HERE.
MM-HMM.
YEAH, WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SPEAK
DIRECTLY TO THE MANIFESTATION?
OKAY, YEAH, I WILL.
WE HAVE A DEAL?
SO WE MEET AGAIN, MARCONI.
YOU THOUGHT--
DAMN. HE'S GOOD.
- MARCONI. MARCONI.
Arnie:
YOU GUYS ALREADY HAVE A BIT OF
A FOLLOWING THOUGH, DON'T YA?
DEVOTED TO YOU
AND YOUR FRIEND
AND YOUR... HOBBY,
I GUESS.
David's voice:
YOU HAVE 83Â¢
IN YOUR FRONT POCKET, ARNIE--
THE PENNIES ARE DATED
-
-
WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED.
THAT'S A NEAT TRICK,
MR. WONG.
IF YOU FLIP THE NICKEL 10 TIMES,
YOU'LL GET HEADS,
HEADS, TAILS, HEADS, TAILS,
TAILS, TAILS, HEADS, TAILS, TAILS.
I DON'T THINK I WANNA
TAKE THE TIME TO DO THAT.
LAST NIGHT YOU HAD
A DREAM, ARNIE.
David's voice:
YOU'VE GOT MY ATTENTION,
MR. WONG.
David:
A LOT BETTER.
David's voice: BULLSHIT.
WHAT IT GETS IS WORSE.
IT STARTED JUST
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
WE WERE JUST A YEAR
OR TWO OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL,
- JUST KIDS.
-
I ONCE KNEW A MAN--
ACTUALLY, I MADE THAT UP.
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR!
MY MELON SOUL
CAMEL HOLOCAUST
CRUSHED BY
YOUR GALLAGHER OF APATHY
CAMEL HOLOCAUST
THERE'S A WOLF BEHIND YOU!
CAMEL HOLOCAUST
NO WAIT,
IT'S JUST A DOG
CAMEL HOLOCAUST
HAIR! HAIR!
HAIR!
HAIR!
MY HAT SMELLS
LIKE LUBRICANT
David: TELLING THE STORY NOW,
I'M TEMPTED TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE,
HAIR! HAIR!
HAIR!
HAIR!
HAIR! HAIR!
- HEY, FRED.
- HEY.
HERE'S TO ALL OF THE KISSES I'VE SNATCHED
AND VICE-VERSA.
- AMEN.
-
-
GIRL, WHAT YOU THINKING?
- JUSTIN, PLEASE!
- GET YOUR HAND OFF ME.
PLEASE GIVE IT
BACK TO ME, JUSTIN.
-
- PLEASE?
PLEASE GIVE IT BACK TO ME, JUSTIN.
- Justin:
COULD I HAVE
THAT BACK, PLEASE?
UMM, HEY, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE AMY, RIGHT?
UM...
DO YOU WANT A BEER?
NO, MY DOG JUST...
BIT SOME JAMAICAN GUY.
I'VE GOT TO GO FIND HIM.
MAN, MY UNCLE LOST A FOOT
IN HIS RIDING MOWER.
SAYS YOU CAN STILL FEEL IT.
WHAT'S THAT-- WHAT'S THAT CALLED?
FANTASY LEG SITUATION
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
IT'S CALLED
PHANTOM LIMB SYNDROME,
AND ALL AMPUTEES GET IT
AND IT GOES AWAY.
ASSHOLE.
GOOD ONE, FRED.
- AND THAT'S REAL MAGIC, MAN.
- WHAT'S UP?
IS THERE SOME GUY EXPOSING
HIMSELF OVER THERE?
OH MY GOD,
THAT GUY JUST LEVITATED...
- RIGHT OFF THE GROUND.
- HOW HIGH?
- WOW.
- OOH.
YOU GOTTA LOVE
THE SKEPTIC, MAN.
LEMME GUESS--
ABOUT SIX INCHES
ABOVE THE GRASS, RIGHT?
BALDUCCI LEVITATION?
LET'S SEE. WHAT CAN I DO TO IMPRESS MR.
SKEPTIC MAN HERE?
AH, LOOK AT THERE.
YOU FORGOT TO WASH BEHIND YOUR EARS THERE,
DIDN'T YA?
IT'S A QUARTER, RIGHT?
-
-
WELL, THE BUG'S A NICE TOUCH.
-
- OH.
DO YOU DREAM, MAN?
I INTERPRET DREAMS...
FOR A BEER.
WELL, I DON'T HAVE ANY BEER,
SO I GUESS I'M OUT OF LUCK.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO,
MR. SKEPTIC MAN.
I'LL DO IT LIKE DANIEL
IN THE OLD TESTAMENT.
I'LL TELL YOU
THE LAST DREAM THAT YOU HAD
AND THEN I'LL BREAK DOWN
IT'S MEANING FOR YA.
AND IF I'M RIGHT,
YOU OWE ME A BEER. OKAY, MAN?
SURE.
I MEAN, YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN
BLESSED WITH SUPERNATURAL GIFTS.
WHAT BETTER WAY TO USE THEM THAN
TO FISH FOR FREE BEER AT PARTIES?
YOU HAD THIS ONE
THIS MORNING
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE THUNDERSTORM.
AND IN THE DREAM,
YOU WERE BACK
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND
TINA.
David's voice:
AND YOU COME HOME
AND SHE'S THERE
WITH THIS BIG
HONKING PILE OF DYNAMITE
AND ONE OF THEM
CARTOON PLUNGER DETONATORS,
READY TO BLOW.
AND YOU SAY,
"WHAT YOU DOING?"
AND SHE SAYS, "THIS,"
AND BOOM.
YOUR EYES SNAP OPEN
AND THE EXPLOSION
AT THE END OF THE DREAM
BECOME THE CLAP OF THUNDER
OUTSIDE OF YOUR WINDOW.
SO TELL ME, MAN--
AM I CLOSE?
David's voice:
OKAY.
YOU MADE A LUCKY GUESS.
YOU SEE?
YOU GOTTA ASK YOURSELF, MAN--
YOU GOTTA BE REALLY BRAVE TO ASK
YOURSELF THE SCARY QUESTIONS.
HOW DID
YOUR MIND KNOW, DAVID,
- THAT THE THUNDER WAS COMING?
- HOW'D YOU KNOW MY--
THE THUNDER CAME RIGHT AS SHE HIT THE
DETONATOR AT THE END OF YOUR DREAM.
YOUR MIND STARTED THE DREAM
NOW HOW DID THE MIND KNOW
THAT THE THUNDER WAS COMING?
BECAUSE...
TIME IS AN OCEAN...
NOT A GARDEN HOSE.
SPACE IS A PUFF OF SMOKE,
A WISP OF CLOUD.
YOUR MIND IS
A FLYING CORN SNAKE,
HOVERING THROUGH
ALL THE POSSIBILITIES.
WHATEVER.
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE
YOUR PAPA REALLY WAS
WHEN YOU WERE IN HOSPITAL
WITH BROKE LEG?
DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU
THE NAME OF YOUR SOULMATE?
OR HOW SHE'LL DIE?
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHEN THE FIRST
NUCLEAR BOMB WILL HIT AMERICAN SOIL?
OR IN WHICH CITY?
HEY, MAN!
YOU OWE ME A BEER, MAN!
THREE ARM SALLY!
THREE ARM SALLY!
-
- OH. WHERE'D YOU COME FROM?
- GOOD DOG.
-
-
- OH.
HELP YOURSELF.
-
-
OKAY, BARK LEE,
YOU AND ME'LL GO VISIT AMY,
-
- JOHN, WHAT'S GOING ON?
- WHAT?
-
- WHAT?
-
- YEAH, I'LL BE THERE IN 12 MINUTES.
-
-
- OH!
JOHN?
JOHN?
JOHN. JOHN, I'M GONNA
CALL THE POLICE.
-
- OH!
IT ALMOST KILLED YOU!
YOU'RE A FUCKING IDIOT. YOU KNOW THAT?
-
- NOW WE'RE BOTH GONNA DIE!
- YOU READY? GO!
- YEAH. AHH.
AHH! AHH.
JOHN?
-  DO NOT MOVE.
- WHAT?
I KNOW YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
BUT WHEN YOU TURN AROUND, YOU WILL.
DON'T SCREAM.
IF YOU SCREAM,
YOU'RE DEAD.
THERE! IT MOVED!
JOHN, YOU CAN EITHER COME
WITH ME TO THE HOSPITAL
OR I'M GONNA CALL
AN AMBULANCE, ALL RIGHT?
BUT I'M NOT GONNA JUST
STAND AROUND
- IN YOUR APARTMENT WHILE YOU--
-
JOHN, GO!
-
GET IN THE CAR.
- WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT THIS IS?
- YOU DON'T WANT TO TOUCH THAT.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
COME HERE.
- YOU CALLED ME. YOU BEGGED ME.
- WHAT? I DID?
-
THEY'RE GONNA ASK ME,
SO JUST TELL ME BEFORE YOU FALL ASLEEP.
ALL RIGHT, I REMEMBER NOW.
I WAS-- I REMEMBER CALLING YOU.
IT'S HARD, OKAY,
'CAUSE EVERYTHING'S RUNNING TOGETHER.
I KEPT CALLING YOU.
I KEPT CALLING AND CALLING AND CALLING.
I BET I CALLED YOU LIKE 20 TIMES.
YOU KEPT GETTING
ALL WEIRD ON ME.
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
YOU'RE GONNA BE GETTING PHONE CALLS FROM ME
FOR THE NEXT EIGHT OR NINE
YEARS-- ALL FROM TONIGHT.
I COULDN'T HELP IT.
I COULDN'T GET ORIENTED.
IT WAS LIKE I KEPT
SLIPPING OUT OF TIME.
-
- EMERGENCY ROOM, JOHN.
- WHAT? NO. NO. NO.
YEAH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO, ALL RIGHT?
I'M NOT GONNA PLAY THIS GAME WITH YOU.
HEY, LET'S GO TO YOUR PLACE OR SOMETHING.
ANY PLACE BUT HERE.
SOMEPLACE SAFE.
David:
ROBERT CALLED IT "THE SOY SAUCE,"
BUT NOW I'M THINKING
THAT WAS JUST THE NICKNAME.
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY SOY SAUCE.
- WAIT-- ROBERT?
- THE GUY WITH--
OH, RIGHT YEAH,
THE FAKE MAGICAL JAMAICAN.
-
AH. OF COURSE.
ROBERT MARLEY.
WE WERE IN THE ONE BALL
PARKING LOT, RIGHT?
JUST PASSING AROUND
A JOINT.
THAT JAMAICAN GUY...
HE PULLS OUT THIS SAUCE
AND GOES,
"IT BE OPENING
DOORS TO OTHER WORLDS, MAN."
-
-
DID ANYONE ELSE TAKE IT?
THAT STUFF, DAVE,
I'M REMEMBERING THINGS
THAT HAVEN'T HAPPENED YET.
- I MEAN THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
- JOHN, ANSWER MY QUESTION.
- DID ANYONE ELSE TAKE THE SAUCE?
-
I DON'T KNOW!
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY!
WE WENT TO ROBERT'S TRAILER--
ANDY AND THOSE GUYS,
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO COME.
I THINK THEY GOT FREAKED OUT
WHEN THEY SAW A NEEDLE COME OUT.
AND YOU STILL
ACTUALLY TRIED THAT SHIT?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
HOW COULD I NOT?
-
ANSWER YOUR PHONE
OR JUST TURN IT OFF.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
- YEAH?
- John:
- IS THIS A RECORDING?
-
-
I CAN HEAR YOU AND I CAN SEE YOU.
YOU'RE SITTING
RIGHT HERE NEXT TO ME.
- WHAT?
-
-
WAS THAT ME?
IT WAS ME, WASN'T IT?
I'M SORRY, DAVE.
NO, I REALLY AM.
I'M SORRY FOR MESSING UP
YOUR SLEEP CYCLE.
- COME ON, GET IN THE CAR. - I'M SORRY
FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
ALL THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE GONNA...
EXPLODE.
David:
JOHN. JOHN, WAKE UP.
HE'S STILL BREATHING.
FUCK IT.
-
-
Man:
UH, HI.
I NEED A PRIEST.
WELL, THIS IS FATHER SHELNUT.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
DO YOU...
HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE
WITH, LIKE...
DEMONISM?
NO NO NO. NO NO.
I'M NOT CRAZY.
- OTHER PEOPLE HAVE--
-
WHY DON'T YOU
COME TALK TO ME?
AND THEN EVEN IF YOU NEED
TO SEE A PROFESSIONAL,
I'VE GOT A BROTHER-IN-LAW
WHO'S REAL GOOD.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S LIKE, FATHER?
-
WELL, THEY NEVER KNOW
THEY'RE ILL, DO THEY?
JUST LIKE YOU CAN'T SEE
YOUR OWN EYEBALL.
AND THE REST OF THE WORLD
SEEMS TO GO CRAZY AROUND YOU.
BUT LET'S JUST SUPPOSE
THAT I ACTUALLY--
I MEAN, IN REALITY,
RAN INTO SOMETHING FROM BEYOND THE--
-
AH!
AH.
David's voice:
-
-
UH, HELLO?
ARE YOU STILL THERE?
David's voice:
LOOK, I APPRECIATE
YOUR TIME, BUT...
I'M STARTING TO THINK THERE'S
NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO HELP ME.
SON, I'M GOING
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
EXCUSE ME?
YOUR MOM WRITES ON THE WALLS
WITH HER OWN SHIT.
WAVES OF MAGGOTS
OVER OCEANS OF ROT.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
-
-
-
-
-
-
Man:
BE CALM.
-
- DRIVE.
-
-
-
- AH.
- DRIVE.
JUST DRIVE.
WANNA-- AHH!
JOHN, WAKE UP!
-
- WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?
-
CONGRATULATIONS.
NOW WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU
AND WHAT'S THIS FUCKING THING
YOU'VE GOT ON MY CHEST?!
MY INTEREST IS ONLY IN YOU.
IT IS SAID OUT OF GENUINE
CONCERN FOR YOUR SAFETY.
A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE
YOU MUST PLAY.
KORROK IS
A POWERFUL ADVERSARY.
THINGS ARE IN MOTION,
MR. WONG.
- FASCINATING.
- WHAT?
THEY HARVEST INSECTS HERE,
DO THEY NOT? FOR THEIR HONEY?
DO THE BEES KNOW THAT
THEY MAKE THE HONEY FOR YOU
OR DO THEIR WORK TIRELESSLY BECAUSE
THEY THINK IT IS THEIR OWN CHOICE?
-
-
WHEN YOU HEAR A WORD FOR THE
VERY FIRST TIME IN YOUR LIFE,
YOU WILL HEAR THAT WORD
AGAIN WITHIN 24 HOURS?
DO YOU EVER WONDER
WHY SOMETIMES YOU'LL SEE
A SINGLE SHOE
LYING ALONGSIDE THE ROAD?
-
-
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU
FOR SOME TIME,
BUT THERE ARE GREAT GAPS
IN MY KNOWLEDGE.
DO YOU KNOW I OBSERVED A MAN
WHO MASTURBATED UNTIL HE BLED?
DID HE WANT TO DO THAT?
AND YOU,
WHEN YOU'RE ALONE--
-
-
-
-
-
OKAY. OKAY.
THIS THING I GOT POINTED AT
YOU-- YOU KNOW WHAT IT DOES?
I BELIEVE
I HAVE AN IDEA, YES.
AND ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THE OLD HUMAN SAYING
"I WANT TO SHOOT YOU SO BAD,
MY DICK'S HARD"?
I DON'T BELIEVE I DO.
MAYBE YOU'LL HEAR IT AGAIN
IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS
IF YOU DON'T TRY
TO FUCK WITH ME.
NOW SHUT UP
AND DON'T MOVE.
THINGS ARE
IN MOTION, HUH?
-
Man:
- YEAH.
- DETECTIVE LAWRENCE APPLETON.
WOULD YOU PLEASE STEP OUT OF THE CAR?
YOU AND YOUR FRIEND?
HE'S... RESTING.
GET THE FUCK OUT
OF THE CAR.
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR COMING DOWN, MR. WONG.
I BET IT'S BEEN QUITE
A NIGHT FOR YOU, HUH?
WHERE'S JOHN?
OH, HE'S FINE.
HE'S TALKING TO ANOTHER OFFICER
-
SINCE YOU'RE BOTH GONNA TELL
ME THE UNVARNISHED TRUTH,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT YOUR STORIES MATCHING.
WELL, I WENT
TO A PARTY BY THE LAKE.
I LEFT AROUND MIDNIGHT.
I WAS ASLEEP BY 2:00.
OOH, YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
YOU KNOW, ON GRAND AVENUE?
GRAB A NIGHTCAP?
YOUR BUDDIES
WERE ALL THERE.
NO, I HAD WORK IN THE MORNING.
I WENT STRAIGHT HOME.
David's voice: AS I SPOKE,
A STRANGE JITTERY ENERGY
-
NATHAN CURRY?
A GUY ABOUT YOUR AGE.
- NO.
- David's voice:
HOW ABOUT SHELBY WINDER?
-
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- David's voice:
-
-
AT LEAST NINE PEOPLE
AT THE ONE BALL INN
AT CLOSING TIME
THREE ARE MISSING.
YOUR FRIEND IS HERE.
THE REST ARE DEAD.
AND NOW DON'T TAKE
OFFENSE AT THIS--
BUT HE'S NOT LOOKING
TOO HEALTHY RIGHT ABOUT NOW.
DID HE SAY ANYTHING
THIS MORNING?
JOHN CALLED ME LAST NIGHT,
TALKING CRAZY--
PARANOIA, HALLUCINATIONS,
THE WHOLE MONSTERS-IN- HIS-APARTMENT BIT.
SAID HE COULDN'T REMEMBER HOW
HE GOT WHERE HE WAS LIKE THAT.
DID HE SAY WHAT HE WAS ON?
NO.
YOU KNOW WE'LL
FIND OUT ANYWAY, RIGHT?
TO SOMEBODY LIKE ME,
DEAD BODIES ARE WHAT MATTERS.
NOW IF SOMEBODY IS OUT THERE
SELLING POISON--
I WOULD TELL YOU IF I KNEW.
SO WHAT, THAT'S HOW
EVERYONE DIED?
OVERDOSE?
WHAT ABOUT THAT GUY?
YOU KNOW HIM?
WHATEVER JOHN HAD,
HE GOT IT FROM THIS GUY.
THAT'S BRUCE MATTHEWS.
HE RUNS AN AMATEUR
UNLICENSED
PHARMACEUTICAL OPERATION
ON THE CORNER
OF 30th AND LEXINGTON.
AND THOSE?
BEFORE.
AFTER.
WHAT COULD EVEN
DO THAT TO A PERSON?
LIKE A BOMB
OR SOME KIND OF--
NOTHING YOU'D KNOW HOW TO DO.
I'M SURE OF THAT.
MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING NOT WITHIN
THE BOUNDS OF OUR FAMILIARITY.
WHAT I--
SIR,
WE NEED YOU IN THE OTHER ROOM NOW.
HEY, WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?
GOD DAMN IT.
YOUR FRIEND...
- HE'S DEAD.
-
SORRY. HOLD ON.
SO, UH...
BLACK STUFF--
THIS SOY SAUCE.
THAT'S A DRUG, RIGHT?
- OH, I'LL GET TO THAT.
- IT MAKES YOU SMARTER WHEN YOU TAKE IT.
IT LETS YOU READ MINDS
AND ALL THAT.
IT HEIGHTENS YOUR SENSES,
I THINK.
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S LIKE-- WHEN YOU'RE ON IT,
IT'S LIKE OVERLOAD.
TO ONE OF THOSE INTERPLANETARY
S.E.T.I. ANTENNAS,
YOU JUST GET SHIT
FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE.
YOU CAN SEE THINGS
YOU SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO.
AND YOU'VE STILL GOT
SOME OF THIS STUFF?
- I'M GETTING TO THAT.
- YOU'RE ON IT RIGHT NOW.
YOU'RE ON IT RIGHT NOW
WITH THE COINS AND THE DREAMS
AND ALL THAT EARLIER.
YEAH, I TOOK SOME TODAY.
- IT'S FADING THOUGH.
- THE EFFECTS DON'T LAST THAT LONG?
THE SIDE EFFECTS
DON'T LAST THAT LONG.
THE EFFECTS WILL LAST
THE REST OF MY LIFE, I THINK.
David's voice:
WOW. OKAY, SO--
SO WAIT A MINUTE.
THE KIDS THAT DIED--
THAT WAS THAT
RAVE OVERDOSE, WASN'T IT?
I THOUGHT THEY GOT AHOLD OF SOME
TAINTED ECSTASY OR SOMETHING.
- YOU'RE THE GUY--
- SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
OKAY, SO IF
I CONTACT THIS...
DETECTIVE APPLETON,
HE'LL REMEMBER TALKING TO YOU?
GOOD LUCK FINDING HIM.
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
HUH, WELL...
I THINK YOU'VE GOT
A BOOK HERE,
PROBABLY, IF YOU FLESH IT OUT A LITTLE BIT.
A BOOK?
MEANING A WORK OF FICTION?
MEANING IT'S ALL BULLSHIT?
HEY, A STORY'S A STORY.
I'M JUST
A FEATURE REPORTER,
SO THE FACT THAT YOU THINK
IT HAPPENED IS MY STORY.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T REMEMBER LEAVING
THE HOUSE WITH ANY COINS IN MY POCKET.
I THINK YOU COULD'VE
SLIPPED THEM TO ME.
WITHOUT YOU FEELING IT?
AND THE THING WITH THE DREAM?
COME ON, ARNIE.
I THINK YOU'RE TRYING
TO BE ONE OF THOSE--
ONE OF THOSE MENTALISTS,
LIKE THAT DR. MARCONI ON TV.
DR.
MARCONI MAY BE THEATRICAL,
BUT BELIEVE ME,
HE'S NOT AN ACT.
WELL, I CAUGHT
MARCONI'S ACT IN VEGAS,
AND YOUR STORY SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF
THE SAME KIND OF HOCUS-POCUS TO ME.
COME WITH ME.
I WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?
- JUST OUT TO MY TRUCK.
-
-
NO. OR, YOU KNOW,
IT'S AN EMPTY CAGE.
TURN YOUR HEAD
SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME.
YUP.
NOW YOU SHOULD SEE THE BOX JUST
OUT OF THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE.
LET'S GO BACK INSIDE.
YOUR STORY WAS MORE INTERESTING.
YOU'RE GONNA DIE, ARNIE.
SOMEDAY YOU WILL FACE THAT MOMENT.
AND AT THAT MOMENT YOU WILL FACE
EITHER COMPLETE NONEXISTENCE
OR YOU WILL FACE
SOMETHING EVEN STRANGER.
ON AN ACTUAL DAY
IN THE FUTURE, ARNIE,
YOU WILL BE
IN THE UNIMAGINABLE.
IT IS PHYSICALLY
IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID IT.
THINK ABOUT THAT.
NOW,
WITHOUT TURNING
YOUR HEAD,
LOOK AT THE BOX.
AH! SHIT!
OH SHIT SHIT!
SHIT!
WHAT THE SHIT IS THAT?
WAIT A MINUTE.
HOW THE FUCK
DID YOU DO THAT?
WHAT THE FUCK
IS THAT THING?
WHAT THE FUCK, MAN?
THERE'S NO NAME
FOR IT IN THIS WORLD.
IT'S PRETTY FREAKY
THOUGH, RIGHT?
WAIT. NO NO NO NO. YOU--
YOU MADE ME SEE SOMETHING.
YOU MADE ME SEE SOMETHING
OUT OF MY OWN HEAD.
YOU FREAKED ME OUT SO THAT
I WOULD SEE SOMETHING.
I'M SURPRISED YOU SAW IT
SO EASILY THOUGH.
YOU MUST HAVE
AN OPEN MIND.
MOST PEOPLE ONLY SEE IT THAT
FAST IF THEY'RE STONED OR DRUNK.
I WANT TO TELL THE REST
OF MY STORY, ARNIE.
I NEED TO.
I NEED TO GET IT OUT.
BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT
FOR WHAT IT IS--
- THE TRUTH.
- OKAY.
UNTIL I FIGURE
IT OUT FOR REAL.
OKAY.
EH, THAT'LL HAVE TO DO.
COME ON.
ANYWAY,
SO THE COP COMES IN,
TELLS ME
THAT JOHN IS DEAD.
YOUR FRIEND...
HE'S DEAD.
WHAT? HOW?
-
- CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN.
HE WENT INTO CONVULSIONS OR SOMETHING.
HIS PULSE STOPPED.
WE'VE GOT AMBULANCES.
ONE WILL BE HERE IN 30 SECONDS.
WE'VE GOT VINNIE
DOING C.P.R. ON HIM.
VINNIE IS A LIFEGUARD
IN HIS OFF HOURS.
NOW YOU LISTEN
TO ME, BOY.
HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO.
I'LL BE BACK IN FIVE MINUTES
AND THEN YOU ARE GONNA
TELL ME THE TRUTH.
AND IF YOU OBSTRUCT ME
IN ANY WAY,
YOU'RE GONNA LIVE THE REST OF
YOUR DAYS WISHING YOU HAD NOT.
-
YEAH?
WHAT? DID YOU GET OUT?
YEAH, WE WERE--
WE WERE BOTH--
UMM, YEAH. I, UH--
EVERYONE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM.
THEY SAID YOU HAD--
- WHAT?!
-
NO, I'M STILL STANDING
IN THE ROOM. I CAN'T LEAVE.
THERE'S STILL A GUY IN HERE WITH ME.
ANOTHER COP.
I DON'T GET IT.
SO, UH...
HE CAN'T HURT ME, RIGHT?
-
- AH! AH! AH!
John:
I'M ON THE SIDEWALK OUTSIDE
THE COP SHOP, WALKING.
WHERE ARE YOU?
HEAVEN?
WHAT?
- WH-- WHAT, JOHN?
-
-
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS PHONE STILL WORKS.
- OKAY.
-
ONE.
OKAY, I HAVE
THE BRATWURST.
GONNA HAVE
TO ASK YOU WHY, JOHN.
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, I GET IT.
YEAH, I CAN HEAR YOU THROUGH
SOME KIND OF PSYCHIC VIBRATION
OR WHATEVER AND NOT THE PHONE.
OKAY, I GET IT. OKAY?
- COULD'VE JUST TOLD ME THAT.
-
But it's not very much and it's
WHAT IS THAT STUFF, JOHN?
THE SAUCE--
IT WAS ALIVE.
- I SWEAR.
-
-
I HAD $5.
I JUST SPENT THREE OF IT ON THE BRATWURST.
THERE'S NO MONEY
IN THE BRATWURST.
IT'S JUST A PIECE
OF LETTUCE.
- JOHN.
-
- YEAH.
-
NO, I'M AT THE TRAILER PARK.
WHICH ONE'S ROBERT'S?
-
OH, WAIT WAIT WAIT, JOHN.
JOHN, I DIDN'T GET THE--
HELLO?
THIS LOOKS LIKE
THE PLACE.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
OH SHIT.
David's voice:
HEY, MAN!
YOU OWE ME A BEER, MAN!
-
- UGH.
UH, EXCUSE ME.
SO... I...
SUPPOSE YOU'RE WONDERING
WHY I'M HERE.
SAME AS EVERYBODY.
YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT IN THE NAME
OF ELVIS IS GOING ON.
ME-- I DON'T EVEN WANNA
KNOW ANYMORE.
I SUPPOSE
YOU'RE WONDERING
WHAT I'M DOING
WITH THIS CAN OF GASOLINE?
OH, THANKS.
I FELL...
ON A DRILL.
-
- OH!
YOU LEAVING ALREADY?
HERE, HELP ME.
I'LL BE GLAD TO,
BUT FIRST
I WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY FRIEND JOHN.
WELL, HE'S GONE,
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
MEANING?
HE'S JUST
YOU KNOW A KID NAMED
JUSTIN WHITE, MR. WONG?
-
I REMEMBER NOW. HE'S THAT KID--
KINDA TALKS LIKE A JUNIOR GANGSTER.
WELL, HE'S THE GUY
WHO CALLED IN THE--
THE WHATEVER HAPPENED HERE--
ABOUT 4:00 IN THE MORNING.
Girl: GET IN!
GO GO GO GO GO GO!
-
-
Boy #2: OH!
Appleton: I THOUGHT HE WAS
STABBED IN THE GUT OR SOMETHING.
-
STAY BACK, STEVE.
I GOT THIS.
YO, WHAT UP, 5-0?
SO YOU'RE STILL GONNA BURN
THIS PLACE DOWN?
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND YOU'RE NOT
GONNA LET ME GO.
SO YOU UNDERSTAND MY MOOD,
UNDERSTAND WHY I'M OUT HERE
COMMITTING FELONIES TODAY,
THERE ARE SOME
VERY DARK THINGS HAPPENING
AND I'VE GOT
THIS LONELY FEELING
LIKE I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS,
EVERYBODY'S GOT
A GHOST STORY,
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
I THINK STUFF IS BOTH
REAL AND NOT REAL
AT THE SAME TIME.
I'M AN OLD SCHOOL CATHOLIC.
I BELIEVE IN HELL.
I BELIEVE IN DEMONS
AND WORMS--
VILE SHIT IN THE GREASE TRAP
OF THE UNIVERSE.
AND THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT,
THE MORE I THINK
THAT IT'S NOT JUST
SOMEPLACE DOWN THERE.
OH NO, THAT IT'S
RIGHT HERE WITH US.
WE JUST CAN'T PERCEIVE IT.
IT'S KINDA LIKE THE COUNTRY
MUSIC RADIO STATION.
IT'S OUT THERE
IN THE AIR
EVEN IF YOU DON'T
TUNE INTO IT.
THAT JAMAICAN
SON OF A BITCH,
HE TUNED IN TO IT,
THROUGH THAT,
HE OPENED A DOOR.
HE BECAME THE DOOR.
AND ME?
I INTEND TO CLOSE IT.
UH, EXCUSE ME.
-
-
-
-
- MOVE.
-
UH... HELLO.
-
YOUR SECOND QUESTION
ANSWERS YOUR FIRST.
John:
WAIT. YOU'RE WITH AMY?
AND WHO'S GOT YOU?
UH, THAT'S FOUR STILL ALIVE,
INCLUDING JUSTIN.
OKAY, I GOT ANOTHER QUESTION.
EVERYONE WHO TOOK THE SOY SAUCE
IS EITHER DEAD OR COMATOSE
EXCEPT FOR ME.
JUSTIN?
YO,
YOU NEED TO COME ROLL WITH ME, DUDE.
WHERE, UH--
WHERE WE GOING, JUSTIN?
WHY YOU FRONTING, BRO?
STOP CALLING ME JUSTIN
LIKE NOTHING'S CHANGED, YO.
WHAT SHOULD
I CALL YOU, HOMEY?
JUST CALL ME SHITLOAD,
BECAUSE THERE'S A SHITLOAD
OF US IN HERE, YO.
DUDE, I KNOW
YOU STRAPPED,
-
YOU BETTER LISTEN
TO WHAT I'S GOTS TO SAY.
AS I WAS SAYING, YO...
GONNA LISTEN TO ME, DUDE?
I'VE-- I'M LISTENING,
SHITLOAD.
WE TAKING A RIDE.
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
-
- OH MY GOD, MY BALLS.
HEY HEY.
WE HEARD THE GUNFIRE.
- ARE YOU THE ONE THAT SHOT HIM?
-
- I SAW HIS HEAD.
- I WAS AIMING FOR HIS HEART
- BUT YEAH, I DID GET HIM.
- Amy:
AMY?
DO YOU THINK
HE CAN BE KILLED?
David:
Amy:
THE MALL OF THE DEAD.
WHY THERE?
David:
HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN LIKE THIS?
DOES HE EVER SAY ANYTHING?
HE MUMBLES.
BEEN LIKE THAT EVER SINCE THEY BROUGHT HIM IN.
WAKE UP!
COME ON,
WAKE UP, ASSHOLE.
HEY.
UH, I FOUND YOUR DOG.
I KNOW. THANKS.
LISTEN,
I'M GONNA GET US
OUT OF THIS.
DON'T WORRY.
JOHN'S GOT A PLAN.
-
-  OOH.
MAN! WHERE ARE WE?
WE'RE IN SOME LIQUOR TRUCK
AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY
TO THE ABANDONED MALL
ON HIGHWAY 59.
DID YOU SAY WE'RE GOING TO THE
MALL OR COMING BACK FROM IT?
- GOING!
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,
- 'CAUSE FRED'S STILL ALIVE.
- WHAT?!
NOTHING NOTHING.
I GOT A HEADACHE.
YOU SEE THAT DOOR?
I SEE IT.
YO, SHE'LL BE ABLE TO WALK UP
OUTTA HERE IF Y'ALL COOPERATE.
I NEED HER TO OPEN
THE GHOST DOOR, YO.
BUT IF YOU GIVE ME STATIC OR TRY
TO PLAY THE MOTHERFUCKING FOOL,
AS SOON AS SHE DONE WHAT
I NEED, I'M GONNA MAKE YOU--
- HEY!
-
YO, WHAT'S OUT THERE?
A WEAPON?
YOU TRYING
TO GANK ME, FOOL?
I GUESS THERE'S
NO GETTING RID OF YOU.
ANY MORE OF THEM?
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
THEN COME ON--
ALL OF YOU.
LET'S GET TO MY CAR.
OKAY, SO THOSE WHITE THINGS
THAT YOU SAW TAKE OVER JUSTIN--
THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR HOSTS, OKAY?
NOW, UH, THERE WAS
A DRUG THAT THE GUY,
THE ONE WHO EXPLODED,
HE HAD IT IN HIS TRAILER--
THAT STUFF
IS BLACK, RIGHT?
OH. YOU'RE, UH--
YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH IT?
SOUNDS LIKE YOU AND I BOTH
GOT LONG STORIES TO TELL.
I'VE BEEN UP
- AND THIS CASE AIN'T GETTING NO CLEARER.
-
IT'S THE ADRENALINE--
IT KEEPS ME GOING.
YEAH.
THAT AND THOSE...
PIERCING VOICES
IN MY HEAD.
WAIT.
WHAT KIND OF VOICES?
UH...
-
-
-
- OH FUCK!
- John: AH, COME ON!
- OH! OH!
-
John: DAVE, LET'S GO,
COME ON. GET OUTTA THERE!
-
-
TAKE MY HAND!
COME ON!
SHIT!
-
-
COME ON, LET'S GO.
-
- GUYS, I'M ALL RIGHT. I'M OKAY!
- WHOA!
-  THAT'S NOT FRED.
NOT ANYMORE.
-  - GUYS, LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK YOU SAW BACK THERE.
ANY ONE OF US COULD
BE INFECTED OR WHATEVER,
BUT WE GOTTA
STICK TOGETHER.
WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS HERE.
RIGHT?
FRED, WHY DON'T YOU GO DOWN TO
THE HIGHWAY AND FLAG DOWN A CAR?
YES.
- OH.
-
HELP ME GET HIM
TO THE WRECK!
- COME ON! DRAG HIM!
- Amy: OH GOD, I CAN'T.
-
- YOU CAN DO IT! COME ON!
-
- GET HIM OVER HERE.
- GET BACK! OKAY.
-
JOHN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
MY WEAPONS.
I'M NOT GONNA STAND BY
INVADES OUR WORLD AND INFECTS
EVERY LAST MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD.
WE'RE GONNA GO THROUGH THAT
GHOST DOOR AND CLEAN HOUSE.
WHAT?
I WENT
WITH THE OLD TESTAMENT.
OKAY.
WHY?
'CAUSE WE'RE
THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN.
'CAUSE WE WERE CHOSEN...
BY THE SOY SAUCE.
- ARE YOU IN?
-
YEAH, I GUESS.
IS THAT A PAINTBALL GUN?
John:
GHOST DOOR-- YOU SEE IT?
YEAH.
- ALL I SEE IS A WALL.
-
OH, COOL.
SHIT.
IT'S A GHOST KNOB.
- David:
'CAUSE JUSTIN-- OR SHITLOAD
OR WHATEVER HIS NAME WAS--
HE SAID HE NEEDED AMY
TO OPEN IT.
-
-
HEY! AMY!
OH, I HAVE
SO MANY QUESTIONS TO ASK
- BUT NO TIME TO ASK THEM.
- THAT'S HIM, THAT'S THE GUY--
THE ONE IN MY TRUCK
WITH THE SLUG LAST NIGHT.
OKAY, SLUG MAN,
CAN YOU TELL US JUST WHAT
THE FUCK THIS PLACE IS?
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THERE?
YOU'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT
MY FIST AND THEN DAVE'S DICK
IF YOU DON'T FUCKING
TELL US WHAT THIS IS!
THE OTHERS HAVE DEVOTED MORE TIME
AND RESOURCES THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE
TO DEVELOPING AN ABILITY
TO PASS FROM ONE SIDE
TO THE NEXT
WITH NO SUCCESS.
BUT NOW WE REALIZE
THAT YOU,
-
OH, I HAVE ENLISTED
AN ALLY FROM YOUR WORLD.
THIS GUY?
YOU TRUSTED THIS GUY?
HE'S JUST
AN INFOMERCIAL DUDE.
HEY, DON'T BE
SO HASTY, DAVE.
DR. MARCONI BRINGS
A LOT TO THE TABLE.
THANK YOU, JOHN.
YOU'RE A GENTLEMAN.
ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THIS PORTAL.
THE ENTITY'S NAME
IS KORROK.
AND WHAT DOES THIS
KORROK LOOK LIKE, EXACTLY?
YOU WILL KNOW HIM WHEN YOU SEE HIM.
BELIEVE ME.
-  - HE CANNOT BE
DESTROYED BY CONVENTIONAL MEANS,
BUT I HAVE A PLAN.
LADIES.
IT IS CALLED
THE TRIPPER.
AND IT CAME
FROM WHERE, EXACTLY?
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL
COLD WAR WEAPON
DESIGNED TO TAKE DOWN
A CITY THE SIZE OF MOSCOW.
CONTAINED WITHIN THIS DETONATOR
IS A BLOCK OF C-4 EXPLOSIVE,
SURROUNDED BY A HIGHLY-POTENT
MILITARY-GRADE HALLUCINOGEN.
IF YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY,
- YOU MAY DETONATE IT LIKE THIS.
-
NOW THE TRIPPER
MAY NOT  KORROK,
BUT IT WILL SURE
FUCK HIS SHIT UP.
SEVERELY.
WELL, I LIKE
THE CONCEPT, DOCTOR.
AH! MMM. MMM.
FINE.
HOW DO WE GET IN?
JUST DECIDE THAT YOU WANT TO AND YOU WILL.
-
-
AH.
WE MUST BE IN AN ALTERNATE
UNIVERSE OF SOME KIND.
APPARENTLY IT'S
"EYES WIDE SHUT" WORLD.
GENTLEMEN, WELCOME!
AS YOU CAN SEE,
A SELECT FEW
INTERESTED PARTIES
SO WE THOUGHT
REMOVING THE GARMENTS
YES. A VERY NICE TOUCH.
GOOD! COME.
GENTLEMEN, WELCOME!
I THINK THEY WERE
EXPECTING US.
I LIKE THE LITTLE
TOUCHES THOUGH.
-
- I SUPPOSE YOU ARE WONDERING WHERE YOU ARE.
I'M GONNA GUESS WE'RE IN AN
ALTERNATE UNIVERSE OF SOME KIND.
WELL, THAT IS CORRECT.
TELL ME-- WHAT WAS IT LIKE PASSING THROUGH?
I WASN'T REALLY
PAYING ATTENTION.
YEAH, IT REALLY WASN'T
THAT GREAT.
WE HAVE BEEN AWAITING
YOUR COMING.
WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD
FOR MANY YEARS,
YOUR WORLD, YOU SEE,
IS A TWIN TO OUR OWN,
DUAL OFFSPRING
BORN OF THE SAME LITTER.
WATCH!
UP UNTIL THIS POINT,
THERE WAS A MAN NAMED
CYRUS ROONEY FROM TENNESSEE.
GORED TO DEATH WHILE TRYING TO
CROSSBREED A BULL WITH A CLYDESDALE.
HE CONTINUED TO EXPERIMENT
IN WHAT HE CALLED BEASTIOLOGY.
YES. PEOPLE FROM OUR SOUTH
ARE INTO THAT AS WELL.
-
- YOU SEE, BY 1881
HIS GROUP HAD
INSECTILE FLYING MACHINES.
IN 1902 HE CREATED THE FIRST
PRIMITIVE THINKING MACHINE
OUT OF THE BRAIN
OF A PIG.
YOU SEE,
BY YOUR YEAR 1922
IN 1926
MR. ROONEY PASSED AWAY.
AND THEN SOMETHING
MIRACULOUS HAPPENED
TO THE GREATEST
OF HIS CREATIONS.
AND EXPRESSED
DESIRES AND EMOTIONS.
AND FROM THAT DAY FORWARD, THIS ASTONISHING
CREATURE CARRIED ON ROONEY'S WORK
AND CONFORMED
ALL LIVING NATURE
TO URGE ON THE ADVANCEMENT
OF MANKIND.
FOR SOME,
THIS PROCESS WAS EASY.
OTHERS REQUIRED
RE-EDUCATION.
WATCH!
MAMA.
-
- OW! OW!
NO! PLEASE!
NO! OH! OH!
OH MY GOD!
-
-
TO PROCESS THE MAGNANIMITY
THAT IS KORROK
FOR YOUR SIMPLER MINDS,
WE HAVE TRANSLATED
THE FOLLOWING IMAGES
INTO A FORMAT
THAT WE THINK
THAT YOU WILL FIND
MORE FAMILIAR.
I BELIEVE IN YOUR WORLD
THEY'RE CALLED CARTOONS.
-
MAMA!
MAMA!
MAMA!
Largeman: THERE ARE ALWAYS
THOSE WHO RESIST PROGRESS.
IN OUR WORLD
IT IS CONSIDERED A CRIME.
ON OUR WORLD IT'S CONSIDERED A GREATER CRIME
TO UNLEASH KILLER SPIDERS
ON AN UNARMED CROWD.
WE CALL THAT ARACHNICIDE.
BUT WHAT IF YOU HAD
A THINKING MACHINE?
AN ENTITY SO POWERFUL
THAT IT COULD FORESEE
THE OUTCOME OF ANY ACTION?
FOLLOW ME.
WE ARE ALL
VERY EXCITED
THAT YOU COULD
JOIN US.
ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?
THAT IF FRANZ KAFKA
WAS HERE,
- HIS HEAD WOULD EXPLODE?
- ACTUALLY, YEAH.
GENTLEMEN, YOU ARE
ABOUT TO SEE SOMETHING
VERY FEW OTHERS
HAVE SEEN BEFORE YOU--
THE ULTIMATE MANIFESTATION
DAVE, JOHN,
MEET KORROK.
-
WELCOME.
- Both: WHAT?
- WITH A TINY CHANGE IN YOUR BRAIN CHEMISTRY,
-
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- Korrok:
GET THE FUCK
OUT OF MY HEAD!
DAVID WONG,
SON OF AN INSANE PROSTITUTE
-
THEY WILL SOON BE
IN YOUR WORLD TOO.
HE SHOWED US THE WAY
TO YOUR WORLD.
BUT WE HAVE TRIED.
OH, WE HAVE TRIED.
DAVE, JOHN,
YOUR ARRIVAL HERE
IS A NEW DAWN.
YOU CAN SHOW US THE WAY TO GO
FROM OUR WORLD TO YOUR OWN.
YOU SEE, IN OUR WORLD,
WHEN SOMEONE IS BORN
WITH SPECIAL WISDOM,
HE SHARES IT WITH KORROK
SO THAT KORROK
COULD BE GREATER.
WATCH.
AH! AH!
-
- Korrok:
WE UNDERSTAND.
WE ONLY HAVE THE BEST INTENTIONS.
SO THAT YOU TOO CAN KNOW THE
BENEFICENCE THAT IS KORROK.
BUT FIRST
WE HAVE TO SHARE YOUR
KNOWLEDGE WITH KORROK.
-
-
-
- DAVE!
-
-
- JOHN!
-
-
-
NO!
-
-
-
- DOOR!
AW, MAN.
YOU FUCKED UP
- THE DETONATION SEQUENCE!
- Largeman:
ALL OF THE HUMAN MINDS
WHO HAVE EVER LIVED IN HISTORY,
ALL OF YOUR
THINKERS AND WRITERS
AND TEACHERS
AND PHILOSOPHERS
COULD NOT EQUAL
EVEN ONE NODE
OUR LEGIONS ARE READY
FOR THE CALL.
-
- HMM?
-
- HMM?
-
DID BARK LEE JUST
SACRIFICE HIS LIFE?
- DAMN. THAT DOG JUST SAVED THE UNIVERSE.
- AMY'S GONNA KILL ME.
WE MUST HURRY.
MOVE. NOW!
WAIT. IF YOU COULD
CROSS OVER HERE SO EASILY,
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST DELIVER
THE FREAKING BOMB? WHY US?
WE NEEDED TO SEND SOMEONE THEY
WOULD CONSIDER TOTALLY INNOCUOUS--
COMPLETELY UNABLE TO POSE
A SERIOUS THREAT.
BESIDES, THE DOG
NEEDED AN ESCORT.
YES. GOOD THINKING.
Arnie:
- KORROK STILL EXISTS?
- FROM OUR WORLD,
IT'S HARD TO REALLY
KNOW FOR SURE.
BUT IT'S NO SECRET
THAT THERE'S
STILL STRANGE STUFF
GOING DOWN IN THIS TOWN.
WHAT ABOUT THE GIRL, AMY?
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?
AMY WASN'T TOO HAPPY
ABOUT HER DOG.
THE SOY SAUCE THAT THE
DOG INGESTED WHEN HE BIT
THE JAMAICAN GUY ALLOWED BARK
LEE TO PSYCHICALLY CONNECT
SO THE DOG KNEW
WHAT HAD TO BE DONE
AS TO AMY...
SHE'S UPSTATE AT COLLEGE.
GOT A 3.7 G.P.A.
GOOD FOR HER.
AND JOHN?
WHAT, UH-- WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
HE SURVIVED TOO?
WE SHOOT HOOPS A LOT--
WHENEVER WE'RE NOT
TOO BUSY WITH, UH, WORK.
WHAT THE HELL, MR. WONG.
I SAY WE JUST
GO PUBLIC WITH IT,
WITH YOUR STORY.
BUT JUST TELLING OUR STORY,
THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO SHIT.
THE TESTIMONY
OF TWO NUTJOBS--
THAT'S JUST GOING TO GET US LUMPED
IN WITH ALL THE ROSWELL LOSERS.
AH, I SEE. OKAY.
SO WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?
WE SHOW THEM THIS--
A PHYSICAL PIECE
OF EVIDENCE.
I'M THINKING IF YOU CAN GET
THIS IN THE HANDS OF SOMEONE,
YEAH. YEAH.
SOMEONE WITH
AN ELECTRON MICROSCOPE.
RIGHT?
'CAUSE I'M THINKING
WHOEVER TAKES THE FIRST
CLOSE LOOK AT YOUR SOY SAUCE
IS GONNA HAVE
A BROWN STAIN DOWN
THE BOTTOM OF HIS LAB COAT
A LATER.
YES!
MAKE THAT THE STORY.
HELL, LET 'EM SEE
THE EFFECTS THEMSELVES.
JUST FEED THAT SHIT TO A LAB
RAT AND WATCH THE FUN BEGIN--
WATCH THAT THING START
LEVITATING AND SPEAKING FRENCH!
AND YOU'RE-- YOU'RE WILLING TO RISK
EVERYTHING? YOUR LIFE, YOUR FAMILY?
BECAUSE, I MEAN,
BEST CASE SCENARIO,
YOUR CAREER AS A JOURNALIST
IS GONNA BE OVER
BECAUSE THIS IS ALL ANYONE'S
EVER GONNA REMEMBER YOU FOR.
AND DON'T FORGET THAT THERE
MAY BE PEOPLE OUT THERE--
REAL PEOPLE--
WHO DON'T WANT THIS OUT.
OH SHIT.
COME ON, WONG.
I'VE BEEN AROUND.
WONG, I'VE BEEN AROUND.
MY FIRST YEAR OUT
OF JOURNALISM SCHOOL,
I GOT KNOCKED COLD COVERING DEVIL'S
NIGHT FOR THE "DETROIT TRIBUNE."
I WOKE UP WITH MY CAMERA
BUSTED ON THE PAVEMENT,
BLOOD RUNNING
DOWN MY SHIRT,
A BIG FAT COP
STANDING OVER ME
AND HE SAYS,
"STAY DOWN, NIGGER."
SO I THINK I KNEW THEN
WHAT I WAS DOING THIS JOB FOR,
AND IN THE YEARS SINCE--
WHAT, WONG?
THEY, UH--
THEY CALLED YOU
THE N-WORD?
WHY ON EARTH
WOULD THEY DO THAT?
WHAT? IS THAT
SOME KIND OF JOKE?
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?
- OH MY GOD.
- HEY! HEY!
HEY, ASSHOLE,
ANSWER ME!
- OW.
- WHAT?!
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
DESCRIBE YOURSELF TO ME,
ARNIE-- PHYSICALLY.
- TELL ME WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.
- OH, NO NO NO NO NO NO NO.
YOU'RE FUCKING WITH ME.
'CAUSE TO ME
YOU'RE NOT BLACK, ARNIE.
TO ME YOU'RE A SLOPPY
WHITE GUY
IN A RUMPLED CORDUROY JACKET
WITH A TAPE RECORDER.
-
-
YOU THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING IN THERE, ARNIE?
COME ON, ARNIE.
OPEN IT. THE SOONER YOU DO,
THE SOONER WE CAN MOVE ON.
I'M SORRY, ARNIE.
I REALLY AM.
YOU DID THIS TO ME.
YOU DID THIS TO ME.
YOU KILLED ME,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
- LOOK AT YOUR BODY, ARNIE.
-
THE ONE IN THE TRUNK,
I MEAN.
YOU'VE BEEN DEAD FOR DAYS.
I THINK SOMEONE GOT WIND
THAT YOU HAD CONTACTED ME
AND THEY TOOK YOU OUT.
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THAT.
I'M NOT A FUCKING GHOST.
THIS IS BULLSHIT.
THIS IS BULLSHIT.
-
THIS IS MY FAULT, ARNIE.
THIS HALF-LIFE YA GOT.
I DID THIS.
I PROJECTED YOU.
I'M THINKING YOU GOT KILLED RIGHT
AFTER WE TALKED ON THE PHONE.
YOU SORT OF IMAGINE WHAT THEY
LOOK LIKE BASED ON THEIR VOICE?
WELL, WHEN YOU GOT KILLED,
YOU IMMEDIATELY ASSUMED
THE SHAPE OF WHAT I--
THIS CAN'T BE.
I CAN'T.
I DON'T ACCEPT IT.
I GOT KIDS.
I GOT A VACATION
COMING UP IN JUNE.
I'M GOING
TO ATLANTIC CITY.
I GOT TICKETS.
YOU'RE IN
THE DENIAL STAGE RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS ALL NORMAL.
SHUT THE FUCK UP,
WONG! NOW!
I REFUSE TO BELIEVE
THAT I AM ONLY HERE BECAUSE I
POPPED OUTTA YOUR IMAGINA...
I'M SORRY, ARNIE.
I REALLY AM.
HA! RING IT UP!
- 274 TO 137!
-
- AH. - IF YOU WEREN'T COUNTING
EVERY BASKET AS 137 POINTS,
THEN YOU'D BE UP
TWO TO ONE.
WAS THAT THERE BEFORE?
John:
- Dave:
IT'S A HOLE
TO ANOTHER DIMENSION, I BET.
- John:
MMM. AFTER THIS POINT.
-
-
YOU JUST TOSSED OUR BALL
INTO ANOTHER UNIVERSE.
Dave: YEAH. MY BAD.
SO DO I HAVE TO GO GET IT?
John:
- WHOA!
-
- Dave:
John:
WHERE YOU BEEN, MAN?
I'VE BEEN WALKING AROUND
FOR LIKE TWO HOURS.
TIME MUST MOVE
DIFFERENT HERE.
I CAME RIGHT AFTER YOU.
AT LEAST
IT'S COOLER HERE.
UNSTAINED!
HOW?!
I AM SERGEANT VANCE McELROY
OF THE HUMAN LIBERATION ARMY.
PROPHECY HAS FORETOLD THE COMING
OF STRANGERS FROM ANOTHER WORLD.
BUT I CAN TELL
BY LOOKING AT YOU
THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN INFECTED
WITH THE GREAT DISEASE.
IF YOU CANNOT DEFEAT HIM,
THEN ALL HOPE FOR MANKIND WILL BE LOST.
A BRIGHT DAWN IS ABOUT TO MARK
THIS LOST AND BROKEN WORLD.
- TYRANNY WILL FOREVER BE OVERCOME WITH--
- John:
THAT'S VERY INTERESTING,
BUT TO PERFORM THIS TASK
WE'LL NEED A NUMBER
OF ITEMS FROM OUR WORLD.
SO YOU MUST
LET US RETURN THERE
AND COME BACK
TO BEGIN OUR QUEST.
IT IS GOOD THEN.
WE SHALL AWAIT YOUR RETURN.
BUT AS YOU DEPART, KNOW THAT
WE OF THE H.L.A. RESISTANCE
WILL ALWAYS AND FOREVER BE IN YOUR DEBT,
