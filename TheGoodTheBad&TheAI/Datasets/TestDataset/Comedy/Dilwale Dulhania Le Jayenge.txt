London. The greatest city
in the world.
For 22 years, I've lived here
Every morning I take a walk
down this street
Every morning, the street asks me
my name...
Chaudhary Baldev Singh? Who are you?
Where are you from? Why are you here?
Do I have a reply? After half
a lifetime spent here...
this land still remains alien
to me; and I to it
No one here knows me. None except
these doves. Because they're like me
Neither do they belong to a country.
Just drop down where you find food
Have your fill, then fly on
When shall I fly? I don't know.
Of necessity, my wings are clipped
I'm shackled to my bread.
But someday I'll surely go...
to my land. To my Punjab
"When the koels sing in spring,
it's time again for memories"
"It's time again for swinging
under the boughs"
"Come home o'wanderer,
your heart beckons"
"The mute soil doesn't
read your letters"
"Come, kiss your soil, bring back
the earth to life"
"Yes, you have your dreams;
but we are yours too, your kin"
"You are so forgetful,
but we miss you so..."
"Come home o'wanderer,
your land beckons"
Glory to The Goddess
Yes Lajjo, I'm here safe and sound.
- Good
Why is my little one giggling away?
- Mom! Every day for 20 years...
Dad has been walking down
the very same street...
to his very same destination.
Yet every day, you call him up...
just to ask him, "Have you reached?"
- You won't understand
Just assume it's a habit.
- Habit left unchanged...
tends to become necessity-like.
- Philosophy, again? You're twelve
Talk like a 12-year old!
Why all this big talk?
There's no childhood, no adulthood.
One is as grown-up as one feels
All right! I lose! Now go to school,
chew yourteacher's brains, okay?
Why d'you forget
the almonds everyday?
What to do?
Just assume it's habit
Will you get out?
"This is the first time
it's happening in 18 years"
"Some stranger I have never seen,
comes to my mind"
That's my diary!
- So what...?
Only I can read it.
- That was so funny
Let me read some more.
- No way! This is a private diary.
Why hide anything from me?
When a girl is grown up...
her mother becomes her friend.
Show that to me
You won't tell anyone, will you?
- Never
All right. I'll read. You listen.
- Very well
"This is the first time
it's happening in 18 years"
"Some stranger I have never seen,
comes to my mind..."
"shadow-like before my eyes"
"Someone raps on my heart"
"Deep eyes want me to give myself up"
"When I look at my hands,
there I see a face etched"
"A silken breath brushes my cheeks"
"My hair still smells
of the odour on his hands"
"Yes, it's happening for
the first time in 18 years"
"I've never seen this stranger
who comes to my mind"
Simi, you've begun
writing quite well...
and the boy seems lively.
Who's he?
Ma, I've yet to set my eyes on him
So there's no one? I was wondering.
One doesn't find such boys nowadays
And you dream of someone
you haven't even seen! Quite mad
No Ma. This is no dream
I may not have met him, seen him.
But he's there. Out there, somewhere
"The one who comes in my dreams..."
"the one who teases me..."
"just ask him to face me, once"
"What's he like? Who is he?
Who knows where is the one..."
"my lips will say yes to?"
"Is he someone I know?
Is he a stranger?"
"Is he for real,
or just a legend?"
"He stares at me,
from far, far away"
"Tell him not to rob me
of my sleep"
"The one who comes in my dreams..."
"the one who teases me..."
"just ask him to face me, once"
"Some kind of spell is overcoming me"
"Oh what do I do?
My heart yearns so"
"My heart tells me it's mad for you.
Then why do you keep hiding from me?"
"He makes me blossom,
it's all his fault"
"Tell him, I'm asking for the Moon"
"The one who comes in my dreams..."
"the one who teases me..."
"just ask him to face me, once"
Raj! This partying all night!
Party all night and you don't sleep
And how do you get up in the morning?
Late for graduation! Hurry!
Is it a holiday...?
What Raj...?
Late for your graduation?
What to do? Last night...
What's wrong with him?
Has he had one too many beers?
I hear someone has failed.
The Dean has decided...
to announce his name in public
You've made Dharamveer Malhotra stand
an inch and a half taller in his shoes!
I don't think you heard it right.
- I knew, someday you'd make me proud!
And not only me, the whole dynasty is
proud of you! Look, they smile at you
My great grandfather Diwan Brijnath
never went to school
His son, my grandfather
Diwan Dwarkanath failed...
his fourth standard examinations.
My father, your grandfather...
Diwan Pushkarnath, failed
his eighth standard examinations
And I, your father,
failed to matriculate
Not having an education, failing,
are family traditions. I'm happy...
that you have kept tradition alive,
and indeed you're two steps ahead
We failed back home in India.
You came to London and failed!
Are you really happy?
- Glad
Education is all useless.
Filling your head with books...
won't fill your pockets
Look at me. Runaway peasant-boy from
Bhatinda-turned millionaire in London
So, whatever happens is for the good.
Join my offices from tomorrow
Offices? From tomorrow?
- Today, if you wish
I can't attend office now.
- Why not?
Pops, you're a man of experience
You know what amount of hard work
it takes to fail. And I'm tired, Pops
I want a little rest, you know,
like a long European holiday
Long European holiday? How long?
- Month or month and a half
Will you hold this for me?
And turn around
Moron! Did I bring you up
to see this day?
No, don't drop that
Are you all right, Pops?
Pops, you're right. I ought
to take care of your business
You've become so old.
- You tell your fatherthat?
Pops, I've decided against Europe.
I'm joining the offices from tomorrow
In this house, only your father
decides. You're going to Europe
No. I've had enough of a good time.
My years of youth are over for me
Never say your youth is over.
All my life I've slogged to give
you whatever I couldn't do
When youth came and went,
I never got to know
But I wasn't sad, because I knew
that my son will have my years
If you think you've had enough
of a good time...
if you think the years of youth
are over for you, well no problem
Just go and live my years for me
Ajit's letter?
Lajjo! Look, what's here
Letter! From my friend
From Ajit
Just smell it, lady!
The fragrance of Punjab!
The flavour of mustard curry
on leavened maize bread
Those long tailed shirts,
the short knickers
"My dear friend Baldev,
We're fine here"
"We hope to God that you, your wife
and the children are well too"
"You will be pleased to hearthat
my son has graduated in arts"
"He has joined my business.
By God's grace, it's time now...
for us to let our childhood
friendship mature into a relationship
Let's make good the promise we made
to each other 20 years ago. I hope...
you will come here at the soonest
for Simran's wedding to Kuljit
Read on
She's shy! See Lajjo?
That's our etiquette, our culture
My daughter is still so shamefaced.
I'm not a failure
In the heart of London,
I've kept India alive!
Still staring? Lajjo, your daughter's
wedding! Celebrate it with sweets
Chutki! I'm so happy today
Can I say one thing?
- Say fourthings
lt'd be betterto ask Simran once.
- What are you saying?
Ever since she was a baby, she has
known that she is engaged to Kuljit
That she knows. But 20 years...
- Don't you worry!
Simran is going to be so happy...
you'll pray that she never
gets the evil eye!
I'll write to Ajit right away.
God! At last, comes the day
Simran, what are you doing?
I had forgotten, Ma. I haven't
even the right to dream
No my child, of course
you may dream
But don't expect them
to come true
And who know, Kuljit might be
the man of your dreams
I don't care.
I've bought yourtickets.
You're coming to Europe with me
- I can't
Babuji won't let me go to college
alone. Will he let me go away...
touring Europe for a month?
I have lots of work here.
- You've known me for years
Can't you make up an excuse?
An excuse, I can find. But I don't
feel like lying to Babuji
You must come. Dolly and Payal
are coming too
Let me talk to Ma tonight
Europe?
- Yes
With friends?
- Yes
For a month?
- Yes
Chutki, call the doctor. Tell him
that our Simran has gone stark mad
Will you at least take a look?
- Check out your brains first
You talk of travelling by Eurail?
If he hears, he'll bring the roof down
A lone girl mustn't travel like this.
- Mom, I'm not going to be alone
My friends are going to be with me.
- No good arguing with me
I'm not going to object. But you
will need his permission
Ask him when he's home
God, please keep Babuji
in a nice mood
It's just beer. It's over there.
- I told you. The store is shut
Get out
Got the beer?
- Didn't find any
Can't even do such a simple job?
- That was an angry man
I'll get it.
- You won't
Can I have an Aspirin?
- The store is shut
My head is about to crack up!
It's sinusitis
If I can't find an Aspirin,
I'll faint.
All the other stores are shut
Please let me have one Aspirin. One
Hindustani ought to help another
Glory to The Goddess.
- Here you are
I'm feeling bad about forcing you to
open your store for a small medicine
I'd like to buy some otherthings
from you
I'll pick up some beer.
Not for myself.
My friends out there, they drink
Put it down.
- Why sir?
Are you trying to con me? You aren't
getting anything. Put it down
You're getting worked up
over nothing. This is for your profit
Will you put it down?
- Not that umbrella
Here you are. A pound extra?
No two. Keep it, okay?
Shameless!
You call yourself a Hindustani?
You give India a bad name
You're a liar and insolent!
Get out of here
I'm off. I'll keep this
Rev up!
Babuji
What is the matter? You're late.
- Bloody shameless scoundrel
They call themselves Hindustani! Blot
on India! Ought to drown themselves
Rascals! No shame, no decency.
How to respect their elders...
they don't even know.
- Have you had a fight?
Scum! He came for beer. I told him
the store is shut. He took it perforce
He even broke the statue of
The Goddess! Bloody half-caste!
I say Lajjo, thank God that
you and your daughters...
haven't been marred
by this Britishness!
Else, you would've been nowhere!
Damn these scoundrels!
Set sail in stormy waters, and
you're in danger of sinking
You were so little when we brought
you here. And now...
They said that a grown-up daughter
is a burden on a man
But a daughter like you, makes
a father's chest swell with pride!
You're my good girl
Will you give something if I ask you?
- Whatever you wish
I want to take a look at Europe
Eurail is offering a month's tour.
All my friends are going
Please don't be cross. I have
never disobeyed you, Babuji
I'll be going away to a land
I have never seen
The man I'm going to marry
is a complete stranger. But...
I have no complaints. You must've
considered it in my best interests
But I won't get a chance
like this ever again.
I don't even know whether
I'll ever come back...
whether I will have
these friends later on
Besides, it's only for a month. In
a month, I will have lived a lifetime
For the sake of my happiness, won't
you let me have a month of my life?
Please Babuji, give me one month
Go. Live it up
My baby
Where's Simran?
Where might she be?
- Has she slipped in the loo?
I told you to wake up Raj
Did you?
No
Open sesame
Do you have the keys to this?
Anybody home?
No one at home
Haven't I seen you somewhere?
At Robbie's party, no?
I don't go to parties.
- Great! Nor do I, ever
Your eyes...
What's wrong with my eyes?
Reminds me of someone.
- Of whom?
My grandmother. Like you, her eyes
too had hues of yellows and blues
Keep reading. I only wanted to find
out how you read upside-down
This is the limit!
Simran, you're here?
I heard you've missed the train.
- No, I took it
I was afraid...
- By the way, what's your name?
Sheena
Here I am. Shall we...?
- Take it easy
Pump it up
- It's pumped. Look
It's nothing.
- Raj, where have you been?
As usual. Caught up with a girl
Girl...?
- I help her onto the train
And she falls for me.
- What...?
He bored me. He had me all alone,
and he began flirting
Same old hat...
haven't I seen you before?
She sidled up to me.
- What?
I was scared! Only so much space,
and there she was with me
Then?
- Then what? She was lost in my eyes
He was after my eyes. Wouldn't
shut up. Boys these days...
These girls! I just managed
to come out unscathed
What's that?
- Invitation to a party
I told you. It'll be a bore.
- You prophesied a train crash
And then we'd all be charred alive
after supper in a dinner-hall fire
Look, boys.
- Where...?
He's the one
Where have we landed?
Was this your idea?
Us? or the waiters?
- For me.
Rocky shut yourtrap
Why did you have to call him?
You know Sheena, haven't
I seen you before?
Me? Really? Where?
- At Robbie's party?
You might've.
I go to so many parties
You know Sheena...
- What?
Your eyes remind me of someone.
- My eyes? Really? Whom?
My grandmother
Is she singing or crying?
And I can play better piano
You know how to play the piano?
I was born on a piano. Been playing
the piano ever since I was a baby
You know, I've magic in my fingers.
No soonerthan I touch the piano...
it starts playing
Isn't that voice familiar?
Was this necessary?
Doesn't the magic in your fingers
make pianos start playing?
"Stop, my wild lover"
"I've got to ask you something"
"What are you, girl or magic?"
"What are you, fragrance or poison?"
"Come, let me touch you"
"Wait, my wild love"
"I've got to ask you something"
"Look at me, smiling, unknowing"
"I'm waiting for you,
holding my heart"
"She looks subdued"
"But she has lots to say"
"If you say yes,
I have something to say"
"Wait, my wild love"
"I've got to ask you something"
"What are you, girl or magic?"
"What are you, fragrance or poison?"
"You aren't the only
pretty woman around"
"Why are you the only one
who's cross?"
"The one I've fallen for,
is someone else"
"If she says yes,
I'll take her in my arms"
"Wait, my wild love"
"I've got to ask you something"
"What are you, girl or magic?"
"What are you, fragrance or poison?"
"Come, let me touch you"
About last night, I'm ashamed
I misbehaved with you
I wanted to tell you something else
What...?
- This
Run
First come, first served
Hurry! The train is about to leave.
- Where did I keep my money?
One minute, I don't know how to count
this currency... lots of small change
Can you tell me one,
two's, eighths...?
Stop
Train's gone?
The train is gone!
Don't cry, Senorita
But you just stopped crying
It's raining! Don't cry, please!
I'm with you, I'm here! Look
Okay, I'm gone... gone!
Here's your bell
The next train is very late.
To catch up with the train...
at Zurich tomorrow morning, we can
eithertake a bus or hire a car
What would be your pleasure?
Bus or car? Where's she?
Ever since you met me,
you've been harassing me
What are you saying?
- All along the trip...
you've been chewing my brains.
- I...?
Something's always the problem
with you. Today, I've missed...
the train, thanks to you.
- To me...?
I wish to make it to Zurich on time.
So you go your way, I'll go mine
Strange! We're fellow-travellers,
on the same destination, same train
Why split up? Besides, a man like me
ought to stay with a girl like you
Wrong! A girl like me doesn't need
a guy like you. Stop pursuing me
I'll sew it up. I have a thread and
needle. I'll buy you a new dress
What have you got yourself into?
I told you not to pursue me!
Who do you think you are?
What do you think of yourself?
I wasn't pursuing you
And I don't fancy touching you. Thank
your stars I came in the nick of time
Else, you would've been in jail.
I help her, and she says this
Hey, take her away
What did you say?
I got carried away
Never mind Senorita, never mind. In
big places, such small things happen
What's about this Senorita?
- My first girl friend was from Spain
Why did you dump her?
- She hated Indians
You like Indians, don't you?
- When do we reach Zurich?
What's in Zurich?
This is the real Europe
So beautiful, so pretty. Sometimes,
I fear, it might become dirty
Here for the first time?
- Yes
Will you drive faster?
- What's the hurry Senorita?
Train leaves Zurich at 11:30 tomorrow.
We have a whole night and half a day
We'll be there on time.
- Still, if we could...
What had to happen, has happened.
Now you're with me
Nothing can go wrong
Europe is best done on foot
Just the four of us.
Chutki is way ahead of her years
And Ma's more a friend than a mother.
So I never felt the need for a friend
You can't live the rest of your life
with friends. Sometime or the other...
you will need someone who will
walk by you all your life
Can't walk anymore. I'm tired.
- Do I pick you up in my arms?
I can't afford a hotel. Let's try
that house. We might find lodgings
Come. Arrangements for the night
is done
Which is your room?
Situation is somewhat like this.
There's only one room
And we spend the night in the same
room? You presume somewhat like that?
How compelling!
- Not quite so compelling
I'm not staying here one minute.
- You take the bed. I'll take the sofa
No problems.
- No way. I'm leaving
I'm not joking. I'm going away.
- And I'll have the bed all to myself?
So nice... so romantic!
And these curtains... so nice!
And the view!
No horses?
It's so warm in here
There! You have a fire going
Granted. You have a great sense
of choice
You couldn't find a better place
to spend the night, right?
We were getting a nice room
But you'd rather spend the night
with me in the stables. Not in the room
Eat
- I'm not hungry
All right. Don't eat.
How am I bothered?
Eat it
I told you. I'm not hungry.
Come on now. Eat
What did you say?
I got carried away
Never mind. In big places,
such small things happen
You were right, Senorita.
The spirit of adventure in this barn...
you could never enjoy in that room.
- But how do we get to Zurich?
No, not Zurich. Tomorrow evening, we
entrain at Berne. Tomorrow morning...
we take the first bus at eight.
I've found out everything
Now, nothing can go wrong
What's that?
- Life
Aren't you ashamed to drink
in the presence of a lady?
Betterthan dying before the lady!
If you wish to live on...
you too should have a bit, Senorita.
- Don't you dare come near me
All right, don't
I'll see you tomorrow morning if
you're still alive.
Until then, goodnight
"May I have a jig?
- Oh no!"
"May I try a pirouette?
- Oh no!"
"How about a kiss?
- Goodness! No!"
"Let me fly with the wind"
"God! Help me"
"The chill in the breeze
sets my body afire"
"I feel like..."
"making love to you"
"This never happened before"
"I've taken my first step"
"Let me fly with the wind"
"God! Help me"
"May I have a jig?
- Oh no!"
"May I try a pirouette?"
- Oh no!"
"Give me a kiss?
- Goodness! No!"
"Where do you think you're going,
my darling, my love...?"
"You're a pretty girl.
I'm a handsome young man"
"Come into my embrace"
"Let me hold you in my eyes"
"Oh, I'm drunk"
"God! Help me"
"May I have a jig?
- Oh no!"
"May I try a pirouette?"
- Oh no!"
"Give me a kiss?
- Goodness! No!"
"Oh, I'm ecstatic"
"God! Help me"
Up in the mornings,
you look even prettier
How did I get here?
With me. Last night
I don't think you've ever
had a drink before
And you had one too many
Have this
What happened last night?
What happened last night,
was bound to happen
But I didn't imagine
it'd happen this way
Tell me the truth, Raj!
What happened last night?
How do I answer
this question, Simran?
Look, look into my eyes.
Aren't my eyes telling the truth?
No! This could never have happened
This could never have happened.
- That's exactly what happened, Simran
Who can stop what is to happen?
You're lying!
You're lying, aren't you?
No Simran.
- Please tell me you're lying
Granted! I'm lying,
my eyes are lying.
But are these love-bites lying?
Speak
Tell me Simran! Are these yours?
Or someone else's?
Don't cry! I was just joking
Those aren't real! Look!
I used your lipstick
You only had one too many,
and you were dripping wet
I had no options. I had to bring
you here. I swear, I'm just joking
You were all alone on the bed. I slept
out there. I'm just joking! I swear
Don't cry, don't
I know what you think of me.
You think I'm a wastrel
I'm not scum, Simran.
I'm Hindustani
And I know what honour means
for the Hindustani woman
Not even in my dreams can I imagine
doing that to you. Trust me, Simran
I'm saying the truth. Last night,
nothing happened. Just a joke
Please, never joke about that.
You don't know what I would've done
Please, no jokes like that
I promise neverto crack
a joke like that
Get changed. Fast.
We got to catch the bus
May I have my shirt back?
Fifteen minutes before the bus
leaves. You want to eat something?
No, I'm not hungry
Come on, let's take a look inside.
- Churches aren't worth a look
I'm not going
Go on. Take a look
What?
- Hurry up. We'll miss the bus
Shall we?
- Why not leave aftertea?
What did you ask for?
- You aren't supposed to speak of it
Then you must be sure about
being given what you've asked for
Whatever one seeks with a pure heart,
one is surely given
Go on. I'll be back in a minute.
- What happened?
Go on. I'll join you
I'm Raj
I'm sorry, I don't know how to pray.
But I want nothing for myself
But that girl Simran, she's nice.
Very good at heart
Give her whatever she asked for
Where have you been?
In the church?
Half a teaspoon of sugar, one spoon
of milk, bit of cream. Your coffee
You want a postcard to send home?
- Postcard? For home?
If that postcard reaches home,
my Pop will give me up for dead
When were you last serious?
- Till now, never
If ever, it'll happen only once.
- When?
When I'm in love
A boy like you was never in love?
- I've had many affairs
But I was never in love, Senorita.
Never found one
What kind of girl are
you looking for?
Want me to tell you?
The moment I look at her...
all my heart's desires, all my
dreams will come alive
Has never happened. But now I hear
a voice, behind the clouds, calling
She's a stranger, a face I've never
seen before. When will the clouds part?
Has it never happened with you?
- No
No stranger ever invaded your dreams?
No place for strangers in my dreams
I am engaged to marry
Engaged to marry?
- Yes
Where's the fiance? In London?
- No, in India
Looks...?
Don't know. Never seen him
You've never seen the man
you're going to marry?
Not necessary. My father has
seen him. His friend's son
You'll spend your life with someone
you've never met?
A complete stranger?
That's how it happens with us.
- And you're happy with this decision?
The train is here
Lovely photographs. Send me a set of
copies. And your wedding photos too
Won't you be there at my wedding?
- Who's going to travel so far?
Sheena, you must!
- Just joking. Of course, I'll come
I got to take a look at your groom.
Who knows what idiot she's marrying?
You dropped this
What happened? Why are you
staring like that?
I have something to tell you Simran
Go on
I'm in love with you
Just look at your face
You thought I was saying the truth?
Strange Simran!
You've known me for so long...
and you still can't make me out?
Remember? I've never been serious
All this love etc. is beyond me.
Still haven't been able to make out...
how some men spend a lifetime with one
girl! It's a world full of pretty women
Someone has beautiful eyes, someone has
good lips, someone has nice hair...
You boys are all the same.
- But you're one up on all of us
You're about to spend a lifetime
with someone you haven't even seen
That must be true love
Forget it. Think for a moment,
what if you're in love with someone?
I mean, imagine you're in love with
someone you've met on this trip...
why someone? Say you're in love
with me, and I'm in love with you too
Then what will you do? Will you
go back to marry that stranger?
Or, will you have the courage
to have an affair with me?
What will you do?
I don't want to miss the train again.
- I want to miss it again and again
What...?
- Nothing
If she's in love with me,
she's going to turn around
Turn
Turn
Back in London. How a month
passed by, I didn't even notice
Raj, you haven't given me your address.
I'll send you my wedding invitation
You'll come, won't you?
No, I won't come
"What's come over..."
"my heart?"
"Have I lost it?"
"What's come over my heart?"
"Where have I lost it?"
"You're in love, my love"
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"
"You're in love, my love"
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"
"Darling, this is love"
"You're in love, my love"
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"
"Darling, this is love"
"You didn't care to turn around..."
"but I was still waiting"
"By the time I wanted
to stop you..."
"you were too far away"
"What happened?
- I don't even know"
"Why is my heart...
- In love...?"
"You're in love, my love"
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"
"You're in love, my love"
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"
"Darling, this is love"
"Oh time! Stop, tarry..."
"go backwards"
"I've left myself behind..."
"at the crossroads of life"
"Where am I...?
- Where are you?"
"What is this...?
- Magic"
"You're in love, my love"
"Try refusing a million times,
"You're in love, my love"
"Try refusing a million times,
but you're in love"
"Darling, this is love"
"What's come over..."
"my heart?"
"My heart was with me always"
"Have I lost it?"
"I've lost it"
Ma, you remember the dream
I wrote about in my diary?
That face I imagined
holding in my hands?
The one, I wanted to face
I've found him
What...?
What are you saying, Simi?
- Yes Ma. When I was leaving...
I was clear about what
I was getting out of life
For a month, I wanted to be as happy
as I could. Then I'd come back...
and go away to my country to spend
a lifetime with a stranger
I had come to a compromise with my
destiny, Ma. But little did I know...
this was in store for me.
Like a storm he came...
and he swept me off
like a fallen leaf
Love's like this, like that,
I had read, I had heard
But I never understood. When, for the
first time, he offered me his hand...
I still didn't understand.
I was with him for so long...
still I didn't understand anything.
But today, when we were parting...
for the first time I felt
that afterthis moment...
I'm not going to see him ever again.
I kept looking back. He was going away
I wanted to stop him, I wanted to say
something, I wanted to hear something
But he didn't stop. I understood.
This is what love is like
And to him, I've given all my dreams.
I don't even know whether he loves me
All I know is that for me, he's life.
I can never be anyone else's, Ma
You're up? Simi and I
have been talking
She's back after so long.
I even lost track of time
I told you, not to betray my trust
I took a promise from you.
And you've deceived me?
No Babuji...
- Listen, first ask her
I don't want to listen to anything!
Pack. Tomorrow morning,
we leave for India
For good
Let her cry
She has writ it on her own destiny
She will have to learn for herself
how to get over it. Let her cry
What's her name?
- Simran
What girl, Pops?
The one whose face you see
in the moon.
I'm not one of them...
who will go crazy about a girl.
- Yes, I forgot!
Some have good lips, some have
beautiful eyes...
Lives where?
- Who, Pops?
This... Simran
Don't know
- How is she?
Very lovable
Then what's the problem?
Problem is, she's about to marry.
- How about stopping the wedding?
In yourtimes, it was different.
Times have changed
Love is still called "love". That has
never changed, nor will it ever change
She's going to be someone else's.
- The bride goes to the man...
who brings her home. I didn't sire
you to play that fiddle. We aren't...
those who stare at the moon. You
reach out to the moon...
you bring her home. Go
And come home only
with your bride. Get it?
Gone. The daughter is
getting married.
They've sold out and moved to Punjab
I'm coming, Simran
I'm coming
"When the girls go to the riverbank,
you'll hear their anklets chime"
"When the ripe mustard sways
in the farms..."
"you'll know a year
has come to pass"
"Come today, come with a smile,
bring me a song, I've been waiting..."
"for the whistle
of the chugging train"
"Come home o'wanderer,
your mate beckons"
"Come home o'wanderer"
"Your land beckons"
Bless me, Ma-ji
No Ma-ji
Son, 20 years I've held back
these tears
Today, they won't stop, son.
Not today
Simran, my child
My baby doll
How have you been?
- I haven't changed a bit!
You're the bride's aunt now!
Time to find a good groom for yourself
Lajjo, I've been ready all these years!
But in this village...
there isn't one who's a match for me.
So what do I do? For me, I think...
it'll have to be a foreigner!
- You haven't changed a bit
Not a bit!
You did keep us waiting.
Anyway, better late than never
Wife, will you excuse us a moment?
- Get lost
Come on. Baldev, who's this?
Go on...
You don't know?
My daughter Preeti
Kuljit's sister.
- May you live long
Wonderful, isn't it? In 20 years,
the whole generation has come of age
She's beautiful.
- Father's daughter, right?
Get lost
Where's Kuljit?
- Yes, where's Kuljit?
Bhaiyya  is out for a hunt.
He should be back soon
My respects.
- May you live long, son
My respects.
- May you live long, son
That's a strong lad from Punjab.
- Whose son is he anyway?
Get lost
Come, breakfast is ready.
- Yes hurry. I'm famished
Come on kids
For you, for you and for you
You must take me out
tomorrow morning.
Sure Didi
Kids, Grannie wants
everyone downstairs
You know Simi, when I was a kid,
my father would tell me...
there's no difference between
man and woman. All have equal rights
All my childhood, I lived believing
it's true. But as I grew up...
I realised what a lie that is
I wasn't given an education,
because it was more important...
that my brothers be educated.
That was my first sacrifice
Then, at every step, sometimes
as daughter, sometimes as sister...
sometimes as wife... I went on
sacrificing my own happiness
But once you were born...
when I held you in my hands
for the first time...
I made a promise, never to let happen
to my daughter, what happened to me
No more sacrifices at every step
as daughter, as sister, as wife
So what if she's a girl?
She'd live her life as she wishes
She'd have her share of happiness.
But I was wrong, Simran
I had even forgotten that a woman
hasn't even the right to make promises
She is born to be sacrificed for
their men. For their women...
men will never make sacrifices,
nor will they ever make sacrifices
Therefore I, your mother, come to
take from you, your own happiness
Forget him, my child. Forget. Because
your father won't care for your tears
