Good morning,
my little chicks and cocks.
Malcolm, monitoring... All the usual.
How did your team do at the weekend?
- All right, yeah, we won.
-  Wanker.
Sam, morning. How are you?
Well, pop-pickers,
what disc shall we start with today?
Wonky Ron
or how about Simon Foster?
On the Eddie Mair
PM programme on the BBC.
MAlR:
Well, I'm joined by Simon Foster,
the Minister
for lnternational Development.
You've been in the job for 18 months.
Do you think you're making headway?
S I MON FOSTE R :
Yes, I do.
You'd expect me to say that, I suppose.
WOMAN :
Mark.
You're co-ordinating
the Millennium Goals press release?
Co-ordinate it better, please.
Is that the minister?
OK.
Have we heard anything from Malcolm
about last night's interview?
No, not yet.
- Perhaps he didn't hear it.
- Or maybe he's dead.
He might be dead!
He might have finally had that
massive stroke he's been heading for.
It's been in the fucking post.
Preventable sickness in many of the
poorest countries around the world.
And of course,
the big one is diarrhoea...
Ah, diarrhoea. This is the M inister
for I nternational Development.
He should be talking about
food parcels,
not fucking arse-spraying mayhem.
So if we can tackle the easy things
like diarrhoea, then we can...
Oh, say it again. Yes, very good.
What is this, the shitting forecast?
..hopefully that will strike another blow
in the war against
preventable diseases.
MAl R: You mentioned the word "war".
- Steady, Eddie.
FOSTE R :
Against preventable diseases.
MAl R :
All the evidence now points to
a US military intervention
in the Middle East.
Is that your view?
FOSTE R : Well, personally,
I think that war is unforeseeable.
Sam. Sam!
MAl R : Unforeseeable?
FOSTE R : Yes.
No, you do not think that!
Sam, I'm going to have to go
to lnternational Development
to pull Simon Foster's fucking hair.
He did not say "unforeseeable".
You may have heard him say that,
but he did not say that.
And that is a fact.
Now, he's gonna want you to row back
on that "unforeseeable" thing
on Question Time tonight.
On Question Time, you know the funny
question they always have at the end?
Yes.
I think we should prep that now.
Cos I'd like to shine on
the funny question.
I'm a funny guy, with a light touch.
There's this guy, he's a property
tycoon. He bought a South Sea island.
It might be something like that.
If you had to spend the rest of your life
on a desert island with someone,
who would it be with?
Well...I can't say my wife
cos I haven't got one.
I can't say my girlfriend, because
I haven't got one of those either.
- And don't say Mandela. That's...
- No, no, boring. And a bloke.
Or Keira Knightley.
That's a good idea.
Pervert. Sex. Minister.
People don't want to know.
I don't think so.
Did you take
the washing out of the machine?
- No.
- What do you mean "no"?
No, I didn't take
the washing out of the machine.
- It's gonna go really stale...
- lt'll be fine.
- It's not fine.
- It's fine. I'll wear stale pants.
I don't want to go out
with someone in stale pants.
Well, there we go.
I could go commando.
But I don't think
that's accepted in government.
Have you got everything
you need for your first day?
Oh, yes, all in here.
My massive intellect
and an apple for Simon Foster.
Simon "Fluster", don't you mean?
Don't call him that. I'm rebranding him.
He was absolutely crap
on the radio last night.
He sounded like a chicken
with a wasp up its arse.
You give me a week,
I'll have him sounding
Iike a chicken
without a wasp up its arse.
Good luck at the Foreign Office.
Try not to annoy Russia.
- See you later.
- See you later.
I'll give you a call later.
Keep your phone on.
- Be careful. Cars.
- Oh, really? Thanks for that.
Helpful...
OK, OK, go ahead
and print "unforeseeable".
Listen, assume I tell your wife
about you and Angela Heaney
at the Blackpool conference,
what would be best,
an e-mail, a phone call or what?
I could write it on a cake!
With those little silver balls.
"Your hack husband
betrayed you on October 4th...
and congratulations on the new baby."
Yeah,
maybe it's better to spike it, yeah.
OK, fuckity bye.
WOMAN:
Did you put away the lasagne?
Yes, of course, it's in the fridge.
It's got Clingfilm on it and everything.
Why did you put Clingfilm on it?
Because that keeps it fresh.
That's the point of Clingfilm.
No, I don't want to hold.
It might dry out.
That's an amateur mistake.
I'm not holding any longer. What's
he waiting for, a fucking sex change?
It's not carcinogenic.
What, Simon Foster?
Clingfilm doesn't give you cancer.
Diarrhoea Of A Nobody. I like that.
- Aluminium foil...
- Apropos of that...
..gives you AlDS, or, you know,
lasagne gives you syphilis.
- It's not a thing.
- No, you relax!
God, who's that?
MALCOLM:
Get me fucking Brian!
Ifyou don't get me fucking Brian,
I'm gonna come over there.
I'm gonna lock you in
a fucking flotation tank
and pump it full of sewage
until you fucking drown.
- Paris Hilton.
- Are you serious?
- Lily Allen.
- No, no women.
- Yeah?
- The Olsen twins.
- Thank you.
- Who's that?
- Malcolm. He's coming to see you.
- Oh, shit, he's still alive.
- When's he due?
MALCOLM: Now!
And don't say you weren't prepared,
because I rang ahead.
Give us a minute,
could you, please, love?
In the words
of the late, great Nat King fucking Cole,
unforeseeable, that's what you are.
WOMAN:
Who's that geezer?
Oh, I know who he is.
You're Dan, right?
- Daniel? The new adviser?
- Toby.
Toby. Oh. Sorry about the "Dan" thing.
You guys are often called "Dan"
so it's worth a punt.
I'm Judy, by the way. Judy Molloy.
Director of Communications
for lnternational Development.
Is this a normal morning?
The minister was rubbish
on last night's interview...
- He was rubbish?
- Yes. Rubbish.
Come on, Malcolm, he asked me for...
for a personal opinion.
Why didn't you say? He asked you.
Fuck, of course, that explains it.
If he'd asked you to fucking black up,
or to give him your PlN number
or to shit yourself,
would you have done that?
Blacked up, yes.
It was radio, nobody would've known.
Very good.
War is basically unforeseeable, isn't it?
That is not our line.
Walk the fucking line.
We've got Karen Clark
over from Washington today.
We've got enough
fucking Pentagon goons here
to stage a fucking coup d'état.
- Minister.
MALCOLM: Not the time, love.
- I'm busy. Fuck off.
- This is Toby.
Toby, hi. I'm glad you could make it.
It's a bit of an odd morning here.
Welcome to the madhouse.
I apologise for Malcolm.
Don't apologise for me.
Apologise for yourself.
Did I not just tell you to fuck off
and yet you're still here?
It's true, I am, yes, still here.
Hi, foetus boy,
Iesson one, I tell you to fuck off,
what do you do?
Eff off?
You'll go far.
- Now, fuck off.
- Right.
Judy and I were thinking that I could
row back on Question Time tonight.
You're not on Question Time.
You've been disinvited.
- We've been prepping Question Time.
- Why wasn't I told about this?
Why the fuck would I tell you about it?
I told you to fuck off twice.
It's a scheduled media appearance by
this department's secretary of state
so it falls well within my purview.
- Within your purview?
- Yes.
Where do you think you are, some
fucking Regency costume drama?
This is a government department,
not a fucking Jane fucking Austen novel.
SlMON: Malcolm...
- Allow me to pop a jaunty little bonnet
on your purview and ram it up
the shitter with a lubricated horse cock.
Your swearing does not impress me.
My husband works for Tower Hamlets
and believe me,
those kids make you sound like...
Angela Lansbury.
She's married? Poor bastard.
Malcolm, Judy's lubricated horse cock
aside for a second,
are you saying I'm now no longer
allowed to make media appearances?
Correct. Not until we can trust you
to keep the line.
I was going to keep to the line.
I was going to say,
I don't think war is unforeseeable...
- What is it, then?
- I dunno. Foreseeable? No.
No! Not foreseeable.
That's fucking declaring war.
Do you want to fucking declare war?
I'm a Cabinet minister.
I didn't get here by screwing up
every media appearance I ever had.
Write this down. It's neither
foreseeable nor unforeseeable.
Right, so not inevitable, but not...
You'd better walk on this fucking line.
..evitable.
You, hey, put the snifter out there
that if the BBC ambushes a minister
with another surprise question about
the war, I'll drop a bomb on them.
I can't do that, can l? That's political.
Does that not fit within your purview,
Marie Antoinette?
Why don't you just scuttle off back
to fucking Cranford
and play around with your tea and your
cakes and your fucking horse cocks.
Let them eat cock! Hey, you!
Ron Weasley, you do it.
No, no, you needn't worry about
the Canadians,
they're just happy to be there.
Yes, well, they always look surprised
when they're invited.
Shall I just give Toby a call
about this Simon Foster thing?
Yes, good idea.
No, I'm not talking to you.
Get me the Angolan chargé d'affaires.
Yes, well stop him playing football.
Hello.
So, how's it going? Found the bogs?
It's a bit...manic.
Never like this at Agriculture. People
tend not to get so sweary about wheat.
Sorry, Michael, do you mind
just turning it down a bit?
- Just a little bit...grating. Bloody music.
Listen,
I've got a bit of leg-up for you, actually.
Yeah. I think we can get Simon Foster
into the three o'clock with Karen Clark.
TOBY:
Karen Clark?
Was she the woman who went round
Britain in a coracle for leukaemia?
No, Toby. Karen Clark,
US Assistant Secretary of State.
Oh, right, Karen Clark. Wow, great.
- Michael wants to say something.
- Meat.
Meat?
His man is only going to be meat in
the room. No talking. He's just padding.
The Americans don't feel like
they're getting a proper meeting
unless there's 30 people on each side,
so he's basically like bulk in the room.
He's not exactly going to be relevant,
but he 'll be present.
I won't tell him that, to be honest.
- OK, I've got to go, darling. I love you.
- OK, yes, likewise.
Affirmative on that one.
All right, darling, take care, bye.
Can I turn it back up now?
You're on sexual health, aren't you?
That's ironic.
Right, Toby, quick tour.
- I should probably just go and...
- This is Mike.
Just leave it to Mike,
cos he knows what he's doing.
- Don't you, Mike?
- What?
Exactly. He's an idiot.
Listen, I understand your hostility
at new wood being brought in.
Sorry, that's the end of the tour,
I'm afraid.
There is really a lot of very important
people that you ought to know about,
but I have to...
- Toby, hi.
- All right, boss.
I'm sorry about earlier. Malcolm.
- He's a bit of an alpha male, isn't he?
- Yes.
Listen,
I was just um...
- Don't sit on Anna's desk.
- Sorry.
I have managed to get you into the big
Foreign Office meeting this afternoon.
The Karen Clark meeting?
Really? Shit.
How did you do that?
I did it through sheer bloody hard work.
- Judy?
- Yeah?
Tobes here has got me into the big
Karen Clark meeting this afternoon.
JUDY:
Oh!
The big "meat".
Impressive, eh?
How are you spelling that, by the way?
Two "E"s.
Oh, right.
TOBY:
Just one thing.
Talkingwise, you might find once
we get in there, that the bulk of it...
- Can we just wait for Judy?
- Of course.
Simon.
Michael, hi.
Hello. Welcome.
- Michael?
- Yes.
I'm Chad. We'd like a dual horseshoe
formation for the meeting set-up.
An enclave for Ms Clark. An enclave
for the Pentagon delegation.
And, politely, we request the presence
of both carbonated
and non-carbonated waters.
Right.
- Is that all?
- Yeah, that's it. Thank you so much.
Not at all. Wow, who was that?
Young Lankenstein?
He's probably running
something relatively major.
They're all kids in Washington.
It's like Bugsy Malone,
but with real guns.
Thank you all for coming today
to the lnterim Anglo-American
Resources Forum.
I'd particularly like to welcome...
What's your view like?
- Well, it's pretty basic.
- OK, can we swap?
I don't want a consensus
forming around the premise
that military action is necessarily
the primary option at this point.
This paper which was authored
by one of my aides, Liza Weld...
Liza, I hope you don't mind
if I foreground this paper.
It's not strictly mypaper.
In the sense that you were the one
who put in the requests...
Miss Weld is very, very modest,
but this is her paper.
And she's highlighted several reasons
why we cannot envision a theatre
deployment for at least 1 2 months.
Should I say something? She invited
me. I should say something.
If you don't say something
in the first ten minutes,
then you might as well
not say anything at all.
I really think
you shouldn't say anything.
- No, I should say something.
- No, Simon, don't, just don't...
Don't pull my hand down.
The committee feels
a quicker deployment is possible.
Ah, which committee?
It was discussed
in a number of committees.
- If I mentioned one committee...
- You did.
..then it was a slip of the tongue.
What, because you've accidentally
alluded to a secret committee,
a war committee?
If I may intercept. I understand
we are rather pressed for time.
Liza, do you know if Linton
has set up a secret war committee?
- No. I have no idea.
- Get me on it.
I think it's worth noting
that ministers in the UK government,
such as our colleague here,
Simon Foster,
have made it very clear that they feel
currently war is unforeseeable.
Isn't that right, Simon?
Er...well, yes.
That's... That's what I said.
And I stick to what I said.
That doesn't mean that what I said
won't change...in the future.
Um...it's not immutable
or mutable.
It's... It's... It's...
It's a developing...
MlCHAEL: I think there are
areas of mutual discussion
that we could come onto now, and then
maybe if there's time left at the end...
Judy, can you just pass that on?
Is that fine?
Yes, that's all fine, thank you.
Right, come here. We need to talk.
What do you mean, "Stop being a tit?"
In what way was I being a tit?
Why am I even over here?
You were just meat in the room, Simon.
- Yeah...
- Meat in the room?
Yeah.
For fuck's sake, Judy, I've taken
an hour out to come over here
and be room meat.
Yes, but... but a prime cut,
you know, not offal.
Oh, great. I'm not liver.
What was l, tit meat?
Well, no, I just...
SlMON:
Come on. Let's get back.
- Hey, Liza.
- Hey.
I just want to say congratulations.
Your paper got a major citation.
You must be psyched
that Karen brought it up.
Yeah, well, that was,
you know, her call. Not mine.
You couldn't write a paper
that clashes more violently with
the current climate if you were trying.
It seems like you almost were trying.
- I wasn't trying! Believe me.
- You're like the woman in The Omen.
You've given birth to a demon
and now it's gonna kill you.
You probably identify
with the kid from The Omen.
See, you're an only child, aren't you?
I don't understand how my parents'
Iimited reproductive ability
reflects badly on me.
I'm the sperm that made it, so...
- Liza.
- I'm being called by our boss.
- OK, retreat. See you later.
- Yeah, have fun with yourself.
Have fun with your career kryptonite.
What's going on down there?
That looks important.
My teeth are killing me.
Are they chipped?
I think that one
has always been there, right?
It was a chip on the veneer.
- Don't look at my teeth for a long time.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It just surprised me.
TOBY: Liza!
Toby.
Toby! Hi.
- Hi.
- Give me a call!
- Yeah.
- OK.
Liza Weld. She did the
Kennedy Scholarship at my college.
- I had a little thing for her at the time.
- I can imagine, yeah.
Don't think she remembered me,
to be honest.
That is one
of the side-effects of Rohypnol.
Linton has set up
a secret war committee. I just know it.
I mean, Linton is an absolute lunatic,
Liza.
- He is dangerous.
- It's not good.
The voices in his head
now sing barbershop together.
I really, really hope there isn't a war,
it's going to be a nightmare.
It's bad enough having to cope
with the fucking Olympics.
- Minister?
- Just a quick word, sir?
This is your chance to nail the line.
Do you want to nail the line?
No, I'll freestyle it.
Hello, there. Hi.
So is war unforeseeable, Minister?
Look, all sorts of things,
that are actually very likely
are also unforeseeable.
For the plane in the fog,
the mountain is un... unforeseeable,
but then it is suddenly
very real and inevitable.
Is this your opinion or is this
the government position?
The mountain in the metaphor is
a completely hypothetical mountain
that could represent anything.
So, who is the plane,
and who is the mountain?
- Is the government lost in the fog?
- What I'm saying is...
that to walk the road of peace...
sometimes we need to be ready
to climb...the mountain of conflict.
Thank you so much.
Thank you. That's it,
ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
why didn't we nail the line?
Simon, I did try to warn you.
Yes, you tried to warn me, but
you didn't actually stop me, did you?
I can't tackle you to the ground.
That's like shouting "Train!"
at somebody as they get hit by a train.
You should go "Train!
There's a fucking train!"
- Bollocks!
- Fuck, it's Malcolm.
- It's Malcolm for me, too.
How does he do that?
Simon, I don't like finding out about
people employed by this government
via the news, unless they've just died.
Be here, now.
The British Government
must be prepared
to climb the mountain of conflict.
It's unclear if his view
is shared by the Prime Minister.
TOBY:
Maybe we should get it out there.
Float the idea that the war
is a resigning issue for you.
You can't say it's a resigning issue,
because then you have to resign.
You're having a really great first day,
you know that?
You are supposed to be
a Cabinet minister!
You are supposed to be Officer Class!
Don't do this,
don't make fucking waves.
SlMON: We can do without
the ritual humiliation.
You know I'm against
talking up the war.
You're against talking up the war?
Is that why you said
"climb the mountain of conflict"?
Do you know what you sounded like?
A fucking Nazi Julie Andrews.
I'm just saying I might be forced
to the verge of making a stand.
A stand?
Right, The White Stripes, outside.
Uh-uh.
There's only two people
in The White Stripes.
I um...
I admire you.
I really do, I admire you.
Making a stand.
So, I take it, I can tell the PM that you...
you don't want to go to Washington?
- To where?
- To Washington.
See, the PM, he wants you...
Well, he wanted you
to go on a fact-finder, you know.
Problems we might have to face if it
all goes boombastic in the Middle East.
Oh, right.
But, you know, that's you,
you're on the verge, aren't you?
You're on the verge of your stand, so...
Well, Malcolm, come on,
I don't know what words I used
in the heat of the moment.
Maybe in a sense, yeah, I am on the
verge, but that's the important thing.
I'm on the verge.
I'm not in any way decided.
Christ on a bendy-bus.
Don't be such a fucking faff arse.
No, I'm standing my ground,
on the verge.
Right, OK,
well, when you go to America,
talk to Karen Clark
at the State Department, yeah?
- Right, OK. I'll give it a whirl.
- Keep away from Linton Barwick.
He's pushing the war
for Caulderwood's lot.
I'll deal with him. He uses a live hand
grenade as a fucking paper weight.
That's a true story.
Wow, I won't talk to him.
Talk to as few people as possible,
that would be best for you.
OK, Liza, the priorities are shower,
get me on Linton's war committee
and get me to a dentist,
not necessarily in that order.
Shower later.
What has Linton been up to
while we've been gone?
Have we declared war
on California yet?
Ah, Karen.
- How was London? Good meetings?
- Very good meetings.
You know we had some
great discussions there, I think our...
Thank you very much, and I will read
your words when they come through.
Thank you so much, Karen, hm. Bob.
You won't read the words, Linton.
Is Chad coming? Chad?
No, he's probably doing
his desperate chorus girl thing,
hanging around Linton's office,
trying to catch an eye, you know.
That's why he's wearing his
push-up bra today. Have you noticed?
- Assistant Secretary of State, hi.
- Brad, how are you?
- Chad.
- Yep, yep, yep, exactly.
- Can l...?
- Yep, you betcha, OK.
Hey, listen, the war committee.
What you have to do
is you've got to look for
the ten dullest-named committees
happening out of the executive branch.
Because Linton is not going to call it
the "Big Horrible War Committee".
He's gonna hide it
behind a name like "Diverse Strategy".
Something so dull
you're just gonna want to self-harm.
Get me General Miller
at the Pentagon, please.
My teeth hurt.
My teeth hurt like hell.
I'm sick of hearing about
the teeth, frankly.
Hi, yeah.
I'm checking the status on a paper
that was circulated by a staffer here.
It's called...
"Post War Planning. Parameters,
lmplications and Possibilities".
This is the one by...
this is the one by Liza Weld, right?
"PWlP PlP"?
Oh, God, it already has an acronym.
You know another acronym? DOA...
Your career.
My golly, I can't see why anyone would
choose to work in a glass office, huh?
Glass offices,
in my opinion, are for perverts.
I could request the glass be frosted.
Frosting is on cakes, huh?
Now, what else happened in London?
Ah, generally positive, two glitches...
Really, what?
Karen flagged a report
by one of her staffers.
She's obviously trying to use it as some
kind of roadblock. It's called PWlP PlP.
- PWlP what?
- PWlP PlP.
What is it, a report on bird calls?
What does it even stand for?
I can't recall. It's factish.
Intel for and against intervention.
We have all the facts on this we need.
We don't need any more facts.
In the land of truth, my friend...
..the man with one fact is the king.
You said there was something else,
what is that?
In the meeting with the Foreign Office,
the committee was accidentally
and briefly alluded to.
Which committee?
The... The war committee, sir.
All right,
Karen is not to know about this, huh?
She is an excitable, yapping she-dog.
Get a hold of those minutes.
I have to correct the record.
- We can do that?
- Yes, we can.
Those minutes are an aide-mémoire
for us.
They should not be a reductive record
of what happened to have been said,
but they should be more a full record of
what was intended to have been said.
I think that's the more accurate version,
don't you?
- Sir.
- Right.
I don't like this section, let's cut that.
Aye aye, sir.
Let's reverse this.
That was something Karen said, sir.
Well, it's not right, so let's change it.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- And... And I like...I like this.
Ah, thank you, sir.
Yeah, let's say
everyone agreed with that, huh?
So... So the car
will pick you up from the airport.
It's supposed to be
quite a good one, I believe.
The Americans are doing that.
I've just got the contact numbers.
What's she so fucking happy about?
She's probably just on a personal call.
Why has she got control of the blinds?
I think it's...
I'm a government minister and
I don't have control of my own blinds.
I could order you some blinds. I could
order you some nice, heavy curtains,
with swags and a pelmet maybe.
Yes, do that.
OK.
Will you come with me?
So, listen...my team for the US,
Team Simon...
I'm thinking of taking you
and leaving Judy.
I could work with that, definitely.
Plus, she can be a bit, you know...
"Everything's a bit shit, isn't it?"
Like that.
Yeah, it's true. No, she can be,
"Oh, so you're the President and
I'm supposed to be impressed by that?"
"My husband works in Tower Hamlets.
Meh, meh, meh."
"Which is much harder
than being President."
Yeah, OK. Well, that's settled. Fuck it,
she's staying here. Go and tell her.
What?
KAREN: Well, that moves us on
to any other business.
I think I've flagged everything
that I need to discuss, as I usually do.
Everything you're preparedto discuss.
What is that? What are you doing?
I understand you've started a new
committee, Linton. What is that called?
What makes you think that?
It was mentioned
at our meeting in London.
Well, you must have misheard me.
No. I misheard the word "committee"?
Maybe it was another word.
Like, say, Khomeini.
- You're sitting on a new Khomeini?
- Possibly. There are a lot of words.
Kansas City. Kitty.
- ltty.
- "ltty?"
"ltty" is not a word, Bob.
- Commissary.
- Thank you, James...
Why don't you just recap for me,
at the moment,
all the committees
that you're currently sitting on?
I'm sorry, Karen, but you... you appear
to be bleeding from the teeth.
Let me see that. Holy Mother of...
Well, don't try to change the subject.
I'm sorry, everyone. I'm sorry.
Just ignore the blood.
- We haven't finished the meeting.
- I can't ignore...I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be rude,
but this is a tad repulsive.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Liza, come with me, I need you.
Chad, stay here.
Go, Buffy, you belong
to the vampire queen now.
- Liza.
- I'm coming.
Oh, my God. Shit! He's in there alone.
I cannot stand to see
a woman bleed from the mouth.
It reminds me of country and western
music, which I cannot abide. Huh?
That stuff is just choking the airwaves.
- Look, sorry, we just need...
- Oh, my God!
- It's really bad. It's really bad.
- I can't touch anything...
- Nobody was joking.
- It's... I need to catch it.
How far are you with the committees?
I've got it down to two, actually.
One is the "Aims and
Policy Alignment Committee".
The other is the
"Future Planning Committee".
It's not the first one,
because I set that up.
Does it really sound dull to you?
I thought it was a good name.
Right, no...it is a good name.
Well, find out if it really is the...
"Future Planning Committee".
Find out if it really is that.
Um...OK, well, I might go and do that.
You're not going to shout at me
if I go and do that, are you?
I'm not a monster, Liza. OK?
Will you stop implying
that I'm some kind of monster?
Bob!
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.
I wanted to tell you
we're having this stupid
"hunk of the month of the office"
kind of contest.
And I just didn't want, you know,
you to feel objectified in any way,
- or anything like that.
- No, not at all.
And Karen knows about
the Future Planning Committee.
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
- No?
- No.
Excuse me.
Future Planning Committee,
that's what it is.
TOBY:
Wow!
This is fucking cool.
Don't be callow, Toby,
we're on official business.
- This way, gentlemen.
- Oh, thanks.
That was a little bit fucking cool.
Yep.
- Did you book a car?
- Me? No.
Well, Judy will have booked a car.
Judy?
- Hi.
- For fuck's sake!
I was wondering
what the car situation is?
It's Robbie's job to book it
and your job to check it.
There's obviously...
some snarl-up at her end, I think.
- "Simon Forester."
- Oh.
Thank you very much.
"England Government,
Simon Forester."
My name's Simon Foster,
it's British Government.
Hey, Gav, I'm in a fucking motorcade.
Yeah.
I feel like we should have hookers,
do you know what I mean?
I mean in here...now.
- Do you want girls?
- No, no, no, no, no, no. Absolutely not.
No, sorry.
No hookers, it was just a joke.
I hate hookers. Not in
an aggressive way, but, no, thank you.
Strange hotel.
TOBY: It's like a hangar
for businessmen, isn't it?
- That's better, isn't it?
- It's big, yeah.
Just bring them here, that's fine.
Tobes, have you got any m...
Well, I haven't been to an ATM,
so I've not... I've only got English.
I mean,
I don't suppose English money is...
This and this, sorry that's...
TOBY:
It's usually a dollar a bag.
Ooh, well, there's the Capitol,
you can see there through
that window and that tree.
Technically,
you've got a Capitol Hill view.
Hi.
Excuse me.
Hello. How are you doing?
Was it something I said?
I haven't seen you in a month.
I haven't felt that in years. Thank you.
You're beautiful.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sure you say that to all the girls.
Yes, I do...
and some of the soldiers, too.
That's why you shouldn't
run for office, bimbo eruptions.
Come on, don't believe that shit.
I'm not gonna run for office.
I'm just trying to do something different.
It's one of the reasons I like you.
I know your passion
about education and housing and...
- Lingerie. Bestiality.
- There you go.
I'd forgotten about that.
Are you still allergic to the dog?
Yes, yes, I wake up and my eyes
are closed and my head is swollen
and I look like a giant ball sac.
Oh, my God. You know,
they do have modern medication
for that sort of thing.
- Beautiful ball sac, though.
- Thank you very much.
- How's the Pentagon?
- It's kicked up a little.
They're talking invasion
reasonably seriously.
Is there somewhere
we can talk about this?
- I don't know.
- There must be.
- I don't live here.
- Follow me.
- Go that way.
- Don't let people know we're leaving.
This is good. Her daughter's not home,
I talked to her.
- In here?
- Yeah.
Although, I don't know what we'll say
if somebody comes in right now.
No, I can't think
of a good possible excuse, no.
No, me neither, me neither.
- What?
- Come here.
Just be careful, don't mess stuff up.
- Oh, come on, it's toys.
- Let's sit down.
- So...
- Yeah.
Not enough troops.
Total minimum
European Theatre requirement.
The Far East, Asia.
- OK. That's how many we have?
- Total there, yes.
And then we have the contingency
already deployed.
OK, I don't... You've lost me.
Hold on a minute...
Oh, fuck this.
What?
TOY:
* La la la, la la la la, la la la.
Good.
Your military hardware
is impressive, General.
Yeah, well, not any more, it isn't.
- So, you add these together.
So this is the number of combat troops
available for an invasion,
according to these figures.
TOY:
Thousand?
No, 1 2. 1 2 troops.
Oh, come on, you're shitting me?
I am shitting you.
but that's not enough...
that's the amount that are going to die.
And at the end of a war
you need some soldiers left, really,
or else it looks like you've lost.
TOY:
Bye, for now.
You know what? I've got some Brits
I have to meet tomorrow.
A guy named Simon Foster.
Who's Simon Foster?
He's this guy that said publicly
that war was unforeseeable.
And I think he could be very useful
on the war committee.
He can internationalise the dissent,
start to.
You're going to use him
as a little meat puppet?
Tobes...hi.
Hi.
What are we gonna...do tonight?
Gonna do tonight?
Yes, what are we up to, my...
my chief aide...?
Well...yeah, I mean,
I sort of thought tonight
we'd probably be just a bit tired, really.
No, I am tired.
But I'm also a career politician, Toby,
in the political powerhouse of the world
for 48 hours,
and I thought it might be nice to go out
rather than just sitting in my room
trying to spank one out
over a shark documentary,
because I'm scared if I watch a porno
it'll end up in
the register of members' interests. So...
What have you got...for us to do?
Right, what have I got?
Well, so far we've got...
Well, there's a leaflet through the door
for happy hour at the bar
which might be interesting.
Also I do have the number of a guy
I was at uni with
who works for CNN out here.
- No.
- No?
- Where are you?
- I'm waving at you.
I don't see you, be more visible.
I'm, like, practically on top of you, I'm
coming to you, is what I'm going to do.
You can stop talking
on your cellphone now.
Of course I can.
Look, I have to leave.
Phone Simon Foster's guy.
Tell them, come to the war committee.
I'll give them some face time
tomorrow around ten o'clock.
It'll be coffee and Danish.
Tea. They'll want tea.
Tea and sympathy,
tea and a hand job, whatever.
..great deal that is unknown
about hammerhead sharks,
such as their mating habits.
You can definitely spot
the female ones.
Hello.
Hi, Toby, what are you doing tonight?
Well, no, it's unbelievably hectic.
Actually we're...
Their courtship is a violent affair.
The male will bite the female
until she acquiesces.
The war committee, that's a big thing,
Liza.
Yeah, well,
I have been on committees before,
the Challenges For The Cheese
Market, that was one of the big ones.
Yeah, God, yeah. Love a drink.
Bye-bye. Bye. Bye. Bye, bye.
- Matty, how's CNN?
- Great.
I can't, mate, no.
Liza Weld has got us onto the Future
Planning Committee in the morning.
The "war committee"
to the likes of you and me.
What are you talking about?
The Future Planning Committee
is Linton's war committee.
Do you not work for CN N
or is it the Cartoon News Network?
Come in.
I just wasn't expecting to see you here.
Physically here.
Obviously you're always in my heart.
I'm here, I'm there, I'm fucking
everywhere, I'm the egg man.
Have you come to insult me
in a different time zone?
Yeah. No, sorry, I'm just off out
for a drink with her just now.
No. You're barking up
the wrong cock there, my friend.
Little Toby is staying very much
in his hammock this evening.
- Simon, I've got us on the...
- Hiya.
Jesus Christ, fucking hell, Malcolm.
You're supposed to shit yourself
in there, not out here.
I've got us on Linton's Future Planning
Committee for tomorrow morning.
Brilliant. What is that?
It's the war committee.
What? The actual war...
the actual war committee?
- Who's going to be there?
- Karen Clark, Liza Weld,
me and Simon...
Simon and me.
How about the rest of the committee,
who are they going to be?
Jimmy Osmond, Gwyneth Paltrow?
It's a diversion.
The real committee,
that's happening at the White House.
I'll text you the details,
because I'm going to go out
for a drink with
some State Department bods just now.
Don't mention this to the press, OK?
Don't mention it to anyone.
If the press get a whiff
that there's a war committee
even a cardboard one,
every fucker in this town
is gonna turn up and try and get on it.
So no matter what gay bar
you end up in, keep it shtoom.
SlMON:
I was watching that.
Yeah, well,
I have to have a word with you.
You might want
to slip into your negligee.
- You see this mosh pit?
- Yeah.
Well, they're mostly house staffers,
senators' interns.
Tonight they rage hard,
but tomorrow they go back to the Hill
and argue noise-reduction legislation.
- Is this yours or mine?
- I don't know, I've got three.
So one of these has got to be yours.
Those are like fluids that I've never...
would you call wax a fluid?
No, it's not a fluid, it's more of a...
- It's very intimate.
- It's an ooze...it's an ooze.
Ooo...eugh!
Karen will want you to say
"War is unforeseeable."
And Linton will want you to talk up the
"climbing the mountain of conflict" line.
You say nothing, OK?
You stay detached, otherwise
that's what I will do to your retinas.
Right. Can I go to bed now, please?
No, no, no, no.
We're going to stay here
and you are going to rehearse
saying nothing.
Am I being tortured?
TOBY:
You look worried.
It's the paper that I wrote for Karen.
It's called PWlP PlP, it's about war.
The pros and cons,
and I came up with too many cons.
I'm, like, fucking worried because...
this is, like, my career on the line.
I thought you were worried,
because you were looking worried.
But you know, don't...
I mean, don't... don't worry.
- Thank you.
- OK.
- Sure.
- Thank you.
LlZA:
God damn it!
TOBY: Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm just taking off my shoes.
Why is that? Is it a mosque?
It's just, like...
Is it... Is it a bouncy castle?
Can I just say,
what happens in Washington,
stays in Washington, yeah?
Well, I live in Washington, so that
doesn't, like, really work for me.
TOBY:
Yeah?
A number for a cab company
in Washington DC, please.
Just straight through, straight through.
Hi, I need a cab.
Well, I don't know.
I'm outside number 1 427, moving on...
I don't know,
it's a nice street, it's quite leafy,
federal houses.
Marcel's is nice.
I like their wraps.
And you should go to La Taverna,
the Greek place, that's fantastic.
They do that thing
where they set fire to the cheese.
What's that called? It's a lot of fun.
Yes, it sounds fun.
And, well, there's the Aerospace
Museum and the National Gallery.
Do they set fire to the pictures?
Yeah.
Hi, sorry I'm so late for the meeting.
One or two issues getting here, but...
- I'm Karen.
- Hi. Toby.
Pull an all-nighter?
- Well, l... I was led astray.
- Oh. By who?
I... I just ran into some people
from the MoD and...
Not Penny Grayling?
No.
Another...gang.
Wow, I didn't realise we had
so many delegations in town.
No, well..."The British are coming!"
So...
Yeah, you know what? I have a lot
of things to check on just now.
So this would probably be
a good place to break things up.
No problem.
Brilliant.
Bye.
I've brought your bag for you.
Cheers, man.
Tobes, I don't want to have to
read you the riot act here,
but I am going to have to read you
some extracts from the riot act.
Like section one, paragraph one: don't
leave your boss twisting in the wind,
and then burst in late
smelling like a pissed seaside donkey.
: "The British are coming."
All right, I was late for the meeting.
I am sorry,
but it's not like I threw up in there, is it?
No, you're right, I'm being unfair.
I should be thanking you
for not throwing up.
Well done, you're a star.
You didn't wet yourself, did you?
You're in the right city.
You didn't say anything overtly racist.
You didn't pull your dick out
and start plucking it
and shouting, "Willy banjo."
No, I'm being really unfair.
You'd got so much right
without actually being there
for the beginning of one of the
most important moments of my career.
Thanks, you're a legend.
That was just the beginning, do you
think? Are we going back in there?
I don't know, we barely said hello.
I've had muggings
that lasted longer.
All we talked about
was flammable cheese.
TOBY: What if our meeting has
finished? What if Karen comes back,
and then we're still sitting here?
It's going to be embarrassing, isn't it?
We're going to look like groupies.
What if the meeting hasn't finished?
And she comes back
and we've disappeared?
Maybe I could call Judy? She could...
Please can we try
and just do one thing without Judy?
Fine.
I think we've drawn long enough
from that...teat.
Surprisingly enough, a lot of the marble
in the building is not imported.
- Really?
- It's really interesting...
- If you study the stonework...
- Not at the moment.
So, you made it in OK, right?
Yeah, hunky-dory, thanks.
Can I get a coffee?
Sure, sure.
If we just get started, my assistant
should be bringing in coffee shortly.
Your assistant?
Yeah. So, item.
We need to have a conversation about
the mood of the British Parliament,
the bumps in the road ahead
and what not.
I'm sorry, I don't...
This situation here is... is this it?
No offence, son,
but you look like you should still be
at school with your head down
a fucking toilet.
Your first point there, the offence?
I'm afraid I'm going to have to take it.
Your second point, I'm 22, but item,
it's my birthday in nine days, so...
if it will make you feel more
comfortable, we could wait.
Don't get sarcastic with me, son.
We burned this tight-arsed city
to the ground in 1 81 4.
And I'm all for doing it again,
starting with you, you frat fuck.
You get sarcastic with me again
and I will stuff so much cotton wool
down your fucking throat
it'll come out your arse
like the tail on a Playboy bunny.
I was led to believe
I was attending the war committee.
Yes, Assistant Secretary of State
Linton Barwick asked me to brief you
on the work of
the Future Planning Committee.
I'm away.
And here we are.
The fucking Vice President
has also graced us with his presence.
Give him a bottle of milk.
You didn't wake me up.
The thought crossed my mind,
but you just looked so sweet there.
You know, with the jet lag and all.
I don't know, I thought
you knew what you were doing.
Well, no. Obviously I didn't know
what I was doing, I was asleep.
That's how people walk through
windows, that's how that happens.
Hey, Liza? I've got another call
for you about the committee
from Senator Crudden's office.
Crudden? What is going on?
I mean, how did CNN
know about the committee?
Did Linton post, like,
an invite on Facebook or something?
Liza? Everyone is so hot for this paper,
I just wanted to let you know.
I'm about to run off another ten copies.
- Just stop.
- It's like a Harry Potter book,
if Harry Potter
made people really, really angry.
You're in hot water,
you're lobsterising.
Do you smell lobster?
Because I smell lobster.
Strong...bisque wafting this way.
How far would you go with Linton?
You freaky little stalker.
Downtown?
Or all the way up Brokeback Mountain?
Smells like bisque. Smells like bisque.
Where's the war committee?
I thought I was going.
Simon's going. I thought
you were doing your one-to-one?
Where the fuck is it happening?
It's in the State Department
on the seventh floor.
- Malcolm?
- What?
Do you like how I'm telling you
what's going on where you are?
Let me tell you what's going on
where you are, sweetheart.
A certain vinegar-faced,
manipulative cowbag is about
to discover that she's out of a fucking...
job. Fucking hung up, haven't you?
You fucking hoity-toity fucking...
Hey, buddy?
Enough with the curse words, all right?
Kiss my sweaty balls, you fat fuck.
- There's the grenade.
- I know, I'm looking at it.
He's got "Climb the mountain
of conflict" on his picture.
TOBY:
He's picked up on that?
I'm a bumper sticker.
Shit, there's Karen Clark.
Have a meeting, have a meeting.
What about the dialectic, as it spreads
across the different territories?
- lnteresting dialectic...
- Oh, hi.
Hi. I'll see you at the committee.
We're just sorting out a bit of prep...
Very good, that's great.
- Liza. They're still here.
- I know. I told them where it was.
OK, let's go, let's go. Come on.
Quick, we've got to keep up
with them, now. Let's roll.
No, you can't say "let's roll",
they don't like it here.
That's just who asked to be in
on the committee, it's crazy.
- Yeah.
- Hello.
Are you joining us
or shall we see you there?
Oh, I'm so sorry. No, see you there.
I don't need to do any of the things
that you need to go in there to do,
so I'll just see you there.
- Toby, do you need to use the...?
- No, no, no.
- I don't need the restroom.
- All right, OK.
Yeah, they're insane.
Where is it?
I don't know. We can wait here.
Wait round here. When they come out,
we'll follow them again.
Plenty of room down the back.
We seem to be
overrun with insurgents, Bob, huh?
BOB: There must have been a leak.
- Really, no kidding?
- Unbelievable!
- Is this the wrestling? Is that the ring?
There's General Miller.
I think it's best that we move,
reconvene to a bigger, a larger venue.
- If you follow my lead...
- Take an agenda.
Please take an agenda,
we want to stick to that.
KAREN: This is a cluster fuck.
How did CNN know about this?
- Hold onto that one!
- Could you get Miller to sign it?
If we could do this
with a certain amount of energy.
Just this way, folks.
Moo!
Find a chair,
wherever you're comfortable.
More this way.
Excellent. I'm room meat again.
This is a massive abattoir
of room meat.
Just so you know,
Karen and I did not appreciate
having to skulk around
like Mulder and Scully
to find out about the committee.
Well, you're both here now, huh,
John and Yoko?
We need to talk.
How about my office,
OK, off you go.
- What do you mean?
- I've got this covered.
Go and find the next thing. Talk to that
Chad boy, the boy from The Shining.
He knows things.
- Don't make me pump Chad.
- No, I'm making you pump Chad.
Go on, it'll be easy-peasey
lemon-squeezy.
No, it won't. It'll be difficult, difficult,
lemon difficult, that is what it'll be.
Have a lovely afternoon.
Stop a war for me.
So, welcome
to the somewhat engorged
session of
the Future Planning Committee.
KAREN:
Yes, Assistant Secretary, on point six,
it feels like there's already been
an assumption that we're invading
and don't you think that we should
discuss the practical implications?
I mean, this is,
after all, the war committee.
This is the Future Planning Committee.
Well, unofficially,
it is called the war committee.
Well, Karen, unofficially,
we can call anything whatever we want.
I mean, unofficially, this is a shoe, but
it's not, Karen, it is a glass of water.
And this is
the Future Planning Committee.
Well, unofficially,
this appears to be bullshit.
Hey.
- What's all this?
- "Climb the mountain of conflict!"
We're just choosing a font
for what looks appropriate.
What about that font the SS used?
Have you thought about
using that one?
Er...well,
that obviously has bad connotations.
Heavy metal?
- No, the SS.
- Oh, right.
Has a decision already been made,
in principle, to advocate invasion?
I would refer you
to the recent comments
of our colleague from the UK,
Mr Simon Foster, in that regard.
Yes, I think that Mr Foster
would have something to say to that.
I'm... I'm certainly hearing both sides.
In England we have a saying
for a situation such as this,
