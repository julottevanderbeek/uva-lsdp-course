Ah!
Ah!
Have you ever experienced
that instant headache...
when you eat ice too quickIy?
No.
Wash your hands.
Excuse me.
I'm reaIIy sorry.
It happens aII the time.
I wouId Iike
to propose a toast...
to the Baroness
and Baron Von Troken.
May you aIways be Baron.
Ahh, the famous Genovian
pear and cheese dessert.
What eIse?
Ooh.
WOMAN:
...to our country.
You are nothing
but an overdressed, drunken--
I'm outta here!
Oof! Aah!
WOMAN/ Oh! l am sopping!
Was that my fauIt?
Ha ha ha ha!
ShaII we adjourn
to the grand haII for coffee?
Sorry I Iet you down, Dad.
Good night, Louie.
CLARlSSE/ This place was such
a mess when l first arrived.
l've been spending
every spare moment in it l can.
Pick up one of these.
Make yourseIf usefuI.
Spray everything.
You're not mad at me
for what happened?
ActuaIIy,
I found it rather funny.
Reminds me of
my first royaI dinner party.
I accidentaIIy knocked
over a suit of armor...
and the spear went right
through the suckIing pig.
AmeIia, why don't we canceI
Iessons for today...
and just have some fun?
MlA/ Fun?
You're not too busy
for something Iike that?
Your Majesty,
Lady Jerome has arrived...
and l have the French
Consulate's assistant on hold.
He wants to confirm
tonight's dinner.
Send my apoIogies.
CanceI everything for today.
l'm being shown
San Francisco...
by a true San Franciscan.
Tell Joseph l'll need the car.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, wait!
I want to show you my baby.
lt's a she thing
and it's all in me
l can be anything
that l want to be
Don't consider me a minority
Ladies, help me out...
CLARlSSE/ l haven't sat
in the front seat of a car...
in the longest time.
MlA/ By the way...
thanks for the money
for my car, Grandma.
CLARlSSE/
So, where are you taking me?
MlA/
Well, do you have any change?
CLARlSSE/ lt's not appropriate
for royalty to jingle.
MlA/ OK.
l'll get the change.
This one's my favorite!
You put the quarter in
and grab his hand.
CLARlSSE/ l touch that?
Yes, you touch that.
And then
you press the button...
and, uh...
And then you just go.
CLARlSSE/
Looks like Rupert's cousin...
from Liechtenstein.
How do I know when it's ready?
Oh, it'II just go.
There you go!
-Go, go, go!
-Ow!
CLARlSSE/
You enjoy this humiliation?
MlA/ Well,
it's hard the first time...
but you can do it again.
HoId this.
MlA/ Oh, come on!
You can do it, Grandma!
I'm ready for you this time!
Ready?
Go! It's going!
It's going!
Go, go, go, go, go!
You're doing it!
You're doing it!
Go! Oh, yes!
Hah! Ho!
Got it! Give me five!
-Five?
-Five.
Oh!
Oh!
I want one of these!
Just not this one.
So...did my father aIways
want to be a prince?
Oh, yes.
Except once,
about 15 years ago...
he seriousIy considered
renouncing his titIe...
because he met
a lovely artist...
who showed him
wonderful things...
about how life could be...
how he couId be.
But?
But he had
a decision to make...
and nobody
couId make it for him.
Not l--though many
people thought l did--
or anybody else.
PhiIIipe knew
that my firstborn...
his brother Pierre,
wanted to abdicate...
which he did, eventuaIIy,
to join the church.
Your father reaIized...
that the Iove he couId
have for one person--
or even two--
couId not make him
forget the Iove...
he feIt for his country
and its peopIe.
It was the hardest thing
he ever had to do.
Um...oh...
Do you want a bite of this?
Why not?
WeII, here goes.
Why, it's deIicious!
-ReaIIy?
-Mm-hmm.
Oh, OK!
Let's get another one!
MlA/ lt's the fastest way
back to the Consulate...
but l hate this hill!
I do beIieve I'm beginning
to feeI that corn dog.
Uhh! Eh! Ah!
Maybe you can just
sneak gentIy through?
-OK, I'II try.
-Good.
CLARlSSE/ Right.
Now, blaze on up.
MlA/ l--l got it!
-You've got it.
-l got it!
You've got it!
Uhh!
MlA/ Oh!
l haven't got it!
CLARlSSE/
Uh-oh! Mia! Brake!
Brake! Look out!
Down here!
MlA/ Aah!
-Oh!
-Oh!
an accident.
CONDUCTOR/
You didn't hear the bell?!
They put me on hoId.
Oh, for the Iove of God!
CONDUCTOR/ Put down
destruction of public property.
I wiII, I wiII.
And Iast, but not Ieast...
driving without a Iicense.
Accompanied by an adult
whose license expired...
I've been trying
to teII you, Officer.
Licenses don't expire
in Genovia.
Not for the queen.
Don't I have
dipIomatic immunity?
You do, but her
we have to take downtown.
What?
OFFlCER/ l'm sorry, miss.
It's aII right, Officer.
I understand.
I...
I understand perfectIy.
You do?
Mia, no town, no city,
no country...
can function peacefuIIy...
if its officers and
its transportation engineers...
don't foIIow
the Ietter of the Iaw.
Why, l would be proud...
to have two such
fine, honorabIe gentIemen...
serving in Genovia.
OFFlCER/
Aw, shucks, ma'am.
Ma'am, we're not aII that.
Oh, but you most certainIy are.
As a matter of fact...
I wouId Iike
to bestow upon you...
the honor of the...
Genovian Order of the...
uh...Genovian
Order of the Rose.
Oh--oh! Ooh!
-Ooh!
-Ooh!
Oh.
WouId you pIease kneeI?
Um...does anybody
have a sabre?
Oh! I've got an umbreIIa!
I have an emergency brake.
This wiII do fine,
thank you.
With the power vested in me...
by the royaI crown of Genovia...
I dub thee--
Artie Washington,
San Francisco, ma'am.
CLARlSSE/
Arthur Washington.
And l dub thee--
Bruce Macintosh
of San Leandro.
Bruce Macintosh...
masters of
the Order of the Rose.
And aII of you bear witness...
to this auspicious moment
in history.
PIease rise.
OFFlCER/ Wait till l go home
and tell Bernice.
Now, Mia, I know
you don't want to go...
aII the way downtown, but--
That reaIIy won't be necessary.
No one got hurt, did they?
-We're insured.
-OK.
ChivaIry ain't dead,
you know, so--
NobIe Arthur,
how very kind.
OFFlCER/
Do you need a lift home?
Oh, that wouId be
very heIpfuI, thank you.
Come aIong, Mia.
CLARlSSE/
Good-bye, trolley people!
MlA/ Please take the car
to Doctor Motors?
-Good-bye!
-So Iong!
Good-bye!
Good-bye.
You were awesome!
You are the cooIest queen ever!
AII in a day's work.
Wave good-bye!
That's a queen!
WouId you Iike to
sIide in first?
I never sIide.
Good-bye.
Thank you.
TOURlSTS/ Good-bye!
MAN/ Hey, Bruce!
How about gettin' on
your royal carriage...
and gettin' us out of here?
TOUR DRlVER/ Here she is.
This is the possible new
Princess of Genovia here.
That's right.
Anyone know where Genovia is?
Anyone?
TOUR KlD/ lt's a country
between France and Spain.
That was a question
on ''Jeopardy. ''
TOUR DRlVER/ This is the girl
that won the genetic lottery.
TOUR KlD/ Look!
Here's the princess!
HARBULA/
OK, back up. Let's go.
The princess
is late for school.
TOUR KlD/
Could you sign my backpack?
TOUR KlD/ Hi, Princess.
May l have
your autograph, please?
Hi. What's your name?
LiIIy.
LiIIy? That's
my best friend's name.
WouId you consider you and
the princess best friends?
I wouId definiteIy say that.
We do everything together.
We shop together,
get our hair done together.
We even finish
each other's sentences.
It's very cooI.
MlA/
And what's your name?
CharIotte.
CharIotte?
You two must be twins, huh?
CHARLO TTE/ Yes.
MlA/ l don't have
any sisters...
but l do have a cat--
Fat Louie.
CHARLO TTE/
That's a funny name!
Will you take a picture
with me, Princess?
HARBULA/ The princess
is late for algebra.
MlA/ Thank you so much.
The pack is back.
Are you ready?
Do they see you
when they look at me?
Do they see
my many personalities?
Oh, no
Can you help me?
Does anybody hear me?
Can they even see me?
This is not reality
Oh
Mia.
Why can't I just
reach up and simpIy...
Hi...hi.
Step into my office.
Why can't l flap my arms
and fly and fly and fly?
Tell me why...
Hey.
Hi.
So, um...
I hope what Lana said on TV...
didn't freak you out
too much.
-No.
-OK, good.
Because I broke up with her
because of it...
and I hate
phony pubIicity seekers.
Anyway...
Saturday night's
the big beach party.
Uh-huh.
I think it'd be cooI
if we went together.
See you on the waves?
OK. OK.
Bye.
P.A./ Attention.
Remember to watch Grove
High School's TV cable show...
Saturday nights with
your host Lilly Moscovitz.
MlA/ Michael.
Princess.
You wiII never guess what
Josh Bryant just asked me.
''Can I borrow a comb?''
No. He asked me...
to go to the Baker
Beach Party with him.
That's this Saturday, right?
Yeah. So I was thinking...
I couId come by
the garage next week...
and Iisten to your band
pIay then. AII right?
Oh, yeah. That's--Yeah.
-Are you OK?
-Yeah, I'm fine.
AII right.

Bye!
Bye.
Too many feelings
Emotions running away with me
There's a feeling inside me
HELEN/ ls Joseph driving you?
MlA/ No.
Joseph was nice enough...
to take the night off.
I'II take the schooI bus
with the other kids.
I Iook Iike an asparagus.
But a very, very cute asparagus.
No, it's OK.
I'II just wear my bIue suit.
Are you nervous
about the beach party?
No. ActuaIIy,
I'm kind of excited.
I think I might get
my first reaI kiss.
-Oh! Who from?
-Josh Bryant.
That Backstreet Boy cIone
you've had a crush on forever?
He is not
a Backstreet Boy cIone.
He's a saiIor.
I thought
he was never nice to you.
Oh. WeII...
I don't know.
He is now.
I just hope that
if he kisses me...
um...my foot pops.
Pops?
Yeah. You know,
in oId fiIms...
whenever a girI
gets seriousIy kissed...
her foot wouId
just kind of...pop.
Ha ha ha! Pop!
Ha ha ha!
I'm gonna go change now.
I hope you get your first
reaI foot-poppin' kiss.
We are Mark and Brian...
and weIcome to
the Baker Beach Bash.
MARK/ Now, with one week
left of school...
you're gonna be
out for the summer...
and we know
what's on your mind.
How are you gonna
find that summer love?
And if you do,
how do you know if it's true?
Here to tell us all about it,
please welcome...
Lana and the Lanettes!
MARK AND BRlAN/
Lana, Anna, and Fontana!
Stupid cupid,
you're a real mean guy
l'd like to clip your wings
so you can't fly
l'm in love
and it's a crying shame
And l know that
you're the one to blame
ANNA AND FONTANA/
Stupid cupid
Hey, hey, set me free
Stupid cupid,

You mix ed me up but good
Right from the very start
Hey, go play Robin Hood
With somebody else's heart
You got me jumping
like a crazy clown...
JOSH: Uhh!
MIA: That was so--
-Awesome, huh?
-Amazing!
Ha ha!
I'm gIad you had fun.
I thought you'd get scared,
honestIy...
'cause most of the girIs
I take on the boat...
they freak out.
Oh, no. I wasn't scared.
Stupid cupid,
stop picking on me
Stupid cupid
And now it's time for
your favorite taIk show host...

''Shut Up and Listen. ''
Later on in my show...

her positive opinion...
of the ''Save the Sea Otter''
movement.
UntiI she arrives...

Reach me

How did they find me here?

How did they find me here?!
PHO TOGRAPHER/
Hey, wave, everybody!
You're on TV!
Wait, Princess, don't be shy!
Come back!
BRlAN/ Hey, chopper boy,
look over here!
Royal deejays!
Josh!
Oh, no!
I am so sorry about aII this.
No, it's fine.
They can't get us in here.
We were having
such a good time...
and then
they came and ruined it.
I know, I know.
Look, they can't see us...
we can't see them.
We're aII aIone
in this IittIe shack.
ActuaIIy, you know what?
It's kind of cozy in here...
and there's no one I'd rather
be here with than you.
ReaIIy?
Yeah.
-Josh?
-Mm-hmm?
This isn't romantic.
Um...it just...
No. It's my foot.
It's caught
in a voIIeybaII net.
Yeah. Here.
Ooh!
GlRL/ Hey! My dad
thinks l'm a princess!
GlRL/
l'm a friend of Mia's!
I teII you what.
WhiIe we're waiting...
how about a foot massage?
That wouId be so wonderfuI.
Thank you.
No. ActuaIIy,
I mean you give me one.
Oh, yeah.
And indeed,
it is the queen of hearts!
LlLL Y/ Thank you, Jeremiah...
for your potpourri
of prestidigitations...
for the past hour.
ObviousIy, Princess Mia
has a probIem...
appearing here tonight...
and I'm sure
she has a good excuse.
l'm Lilly Moscovitz
for ''Shut Up and Listen. ''
Thank you and good night.
Mia...
the coast is cIear.
ReaIIy?
They're gone. Yeah.
Oh, good.
So, what do you say
we go find...
a more romantic spot?
OK.
PHO TOGRAPHER/ Quiet! Quiet!
JOSH: No! Stay!
Give her a smooch!
REPORTER/ Come on!
Give her a big, sloppy wet one!
PHO TOGRAPHER/ Hold it!
Uhh!
Hit him again!
MlA/ Go away! No, no, no!
Go away, all of you!
The princess
has Ieft the buiIding.
REPORTER/ Who have we got?
What's your name?
NELSON/
Where do you go to school?
Josh Bryant.
I go to Grove High SchooI.
What are we,
friends with Mia now?
Yes. We hate Josh.
Sorry. It's hard to keep up
with who we're not taIking to.
Here she comes!
ALL: Mia!
I'm reaIIy sorry.
I can't taIk.
I have to go
get my cIothes.
WeII, here.
We've got your cIothes.
You'II be a Iot warmer.
You guys want to heIp me?
Yeah. Josh is such an idiot.
We'II make sure
no one bothers you.
Thank you. Um...
That's reaIIy nice of you.
This is so great of you.
Thank you so much.
Everything's fine.
MlA/ ls anybody coming?
-No!
-No!
MlA/ Guys,
l really appreciate this.
Thank you.
She's got her bathing suit off.
OK, now!
Princess, hi!
Aah!
REPORTER/ That was
the scream of Princess Mia.
Go away, aII of you, pIease!
HARBULA/
OK. Come here, Mia.
Piranhas, aII of you!
Back off!
HELEN/ My mom always told me
l couldn't cry...
and toId me to be a big girI...
but you've been hurt,
so you just cry.
It was reaIIy bad.
My foot didn't even pop.
SUKl/
lt was just last night...
that San Francisco's
own IittIe princess...
partied at the beach...
but what started out
as innocent fun...
soon turned into
allegedly too much fun.
This is Suki Sanchez
for KPFW.
PIease say something.
CLARlSSE/
Well, there's not much to say.
A picture's
worth a thousand words...
and you have two pictures.
I embarrassed the famiIy,
didn't I?
Not to put too fine
a point on it, yes, you did.
I think you're making
a wise decision...
to abstain from the job.
I suppose
I won't come to the baII.
CLARlSSE/
Of course you should come.
You're stiII famiIy.
Just because you don't
want to be our princess...
doesn't mean
we're sending you into exile.
Your mother's planning to come.
All your guests are invited.
Ex cept for your beach friends.
Now, if you'll ex cuse me...
I'm meeting with the press
to do some damage controI.
You can come in now.
If I may say so...
that did not go very weII.
Is this the way
a princess shouId act?
My information teIIs me
that boy was using her.
The kiss
was mereIy a device...
so that he couId get
his 15 minutes of fame.
And her friends
didn't heIp, either.
Anna, FaIana, Banana,
Bandana, Montana...
I have no idea
what you're taIking about.
Why didn't she have
enough common sense...
to deaI with this?
She's onIy 15...
but today,
she acted beyond her years.
She showed great respect...
and gracefuIIy accepted
your criticism.
You're saying that as a queen,
I was too harsh on her.
I was criticaI of the person...
who couId become
the next ruIer of my country.
No. I'm saying,
as a grandmother...
you might have been too harsh
on your granddaughter.
Do you think she can do it?
Oh, I have no doubts, ma'am.
I thought so, too.
What makes you different
Makes you beautiful
What's there inside you
Shines through to me
ln your eyes l see
All the love l'll ever need
BOY:
Hey, it's Mia ThermopoIips.
Can you autograph your picture?
Josh did.
Hey, there's Princess Pucker-up.
What makes you different
makes you beautiful
What's there inside you
Shines through to me
ln your eyes l see
All the love l'll ever need
LiIIy?
Hey, can I taIk to you
for a minute, pIease?
LiIIy, can I just
taIk to you for a minute?
-Is that cooI?
-Sure. Let's taIk.
But about what, hmm?
How you broke
my brother's heart...
or how you stuck me
with Jeremiah...
during my cabIe show doing...
''Pick a card, pick a card.''
Mwah mwah mwah!
I'm sorry, OK?
I forgot to caII you
and teII you...
that I couIdn't make it.
So I was stuck with
the Happy Houdini...
whiIe you make out
with the Yachting Yahoo.
Those are reaIIy
good aIIiterations.
No! I don't want to taIk
about aIIiterations!
LiIIy, I came up here
to teII you that I'm sorry!
I'm sorry I missed
your cabIe show...
and I'm just reaIIy sorry.
LILL Y: I can't beIieve
that you hung me up...
after aII I did for you.
I kept your royaI secret.
And do you know
how hard it is...
to have a cabIe show
and keep a secret?
You didn't keep it
a secret from me...
how jerky you thought
my being a princess was.
WeII, congratuIations.
You got your wish.
I'm not gonna be a princess.
You're not?
No.
But I want you to be.
What?
I didn't mean it.
The green monster
of jeaIousy came out...
because you were Miss PopuIar...
and l thought l was
losing my best friend...
so I got angry and upset
and hurt and...
I toId you!
I need an attitude adjustment.
But the truth is...
you being a princess
is kind of a miracIe.
Whoa! No!
What miracIe?
It's a nightmare!
No! Think about it!
I just found out
that my cabIe show...
onIy reaches 12 peopIe.
Wanting to rock the world,
but having zip power like me--
now, that's a nightmare.
But you--Wow!
I mean...
MIA: What is so ''Wow''?
Wow is having the power
to affect change...
make peopIe Iisten.
How many teenagers
have that power?
What more of a miracIe
do you want?
WeII...
we'II just have to find
a different miracIe.
Not more, just different.
Listen...
tomorrow night...
is the Genovian
Independence Day baII...
and to make up for
my missing your cabIe show...
I'm inviting you.
I hope you'II forgive me...
and I hope you come.
LILL Y: But what wiII I wear?
MIA:
Mmm! Yay!
I don't know, but it
doesn't reaIIy matter.
I'm just happy
that you're gonna come!
LILL Y: Thanks.
And you can be a princess.
-No, I can't.
-Yes, you can.
-Yes, you can.
-No, l can't.
Let's move it in.
Move in! Let's go!
HARBULA/ Bobby Bad,
hang up the phone!
Yes, Mom. I'II go to
the dentist after schooI.
I hate it when
they move in Iike that.
Mia, it's not
a championship game.
It's not even a big game.
It's just gym cIass.
Just hit the baII.
I don't want to fIunk you
in gym cIass.
Come on. You can do it.
Keep your eye on the ball.
CHEERLEADERS/
That's all right! That's OK!
You're gonna hit it anyway!
Go, Lions!
Come on, girIs.
It's a baII, not a snake.
Back in formation!
I'm sorry.
FouI baII.
It's aII right.
You got a piece of it.
It's OK.
Just focus.
Ha ha ha!
HARBULA/ Focus.
Focus.
That's aII right! That's OK!
Come on, Mia.
Remember, it's onIy a game!
HARBULA/
Keep your eye on the ball.
Go, Lions!
CHEERLEADERS/ Grr-eat!
Let's go! Let's go!
BOBBY BAD/ Would you
rather hit a beach ball?
Order me a pizza, huh?
Pepperoni.
Uhh!
Oh! Oh!
-Run, Mia!
-AII right! Go! Go!
I gotta go. Get up!
What are you doing?
Get up!
HARBULA/ All the way, Mia!
Hi, Josh.
Come on, girI!
HARBULA/
All the way, Mia! Come on!
Safe! And you passed.
Whoo! Mia!
HARBULA/ Nice job, Mia.
Way to go!
Oh! Uh...it's open.
Come on in.
MichaeI! Hi.
How are you?
-What?
-LittIe guy on your--
Oh! Um...
Did LiIIy teII you
that I caIIed...
because I...caIIed.
I brought your car.
Oh, thank you.
Seven times I caIIed.
Doc said that he fixed
what he couId...
and if you had any probIems,
give him a caII.
Oh, OK.
Do you want the check now?
I have the Iast payment.
Yeah. Thank you.
MlA/
Are you hungry or thirsty?
MlCHAEL/ No.
Oh! Here it is.
Um...Iook.
Thank you so much
for doing this for me.
It's reaIIy, reaIIy great
of you.
I didn't do it for you.
Doc Iets the band practice.
Right. Of course.
I heIp with the cars.
Oh, here.
Oh, thanks.
I know you're stiII mad at me
for bIowing you off...
and I'm reaIIy sorry I did.
But I am going to try
to make it up to you.
How?
MIA:
WeII, I'm stiII going...
to the Genovian
Independence Day baII...
and I'm inviting you.
lt could be fun, you know.
I'm wearing this great dress
that I can't breathe in...
and LiIIy's got a date.
Josh Iooks better in a tux.
Oh. Um...
But, see, it's...
I reaIIy want you to be
the one I share it with.
You don't have to wear a tux.
You can wear sweatpants
for aII I care.
Don't worry about me.
I just consider myseIf
royaIIy fIushed.
Ow!
LlLL Y/
Stop the bovine massacre!
Sign up now and save a cow!
Vegetarians have right
to eat special.
Make Grove School
more tofu-friendly.
MIA: HeIIo.
LILL Y: Hi. Go sit by Jeremiah.
Be there in a minute.
LANA/ She's wearing
that dorky hat again.
Hey, you want
to see a trick?
No. Not right now.
What are you doing?
Writing a story?
Oh, weII...
my portfoIio's increased...
by 30%since the Iast quarter.
Look what we have.
The perfect nerd coupIe.
Jeremiah and Mia.
Oh! Miah and Mia!
Listen, Jere.
My friends and I were wondering.
The sweater you're wearing--
was it designed for you...
or did the knitting machine
just bIow up?
Sunglasses, girls.
It's Jeremiah hair gIare.
ls one of your magic tricks
your hair?
Ha ha!
-Hey, Lana?
-Huh?
That is such
a cute cheerIeading outfit.
lt's so clean-cut.
I bet it goes with anything.
Of course it does!
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Mia, you're such a freak!
MlA/
Yeah, l am, but you know what?
Someday
I might grow out of that...
but you wiII never
stop being a jerk.
Lana got coned!
Lana got coned!
-Mia!
-ToodIes.
Lana got coned!
Mrs. Gupta,
did you see what she did to me?
Oh, no, honey, I'm sorry.
I was in
a very important meeting.
Send it out for dry cIeaning.
KlDS/ Lana got coned!
CLARlSSE/ lt's a present
for your sixteenth birthday...
from your father.
It was found
among his possessions.
My birthday's not for two weeks.
CLARlSSE/ l know...
but I wanted you to have it
before we Ieave.
I return to Genovia
the day after tomorrow.
Thank you.
It's Iocked.
If you open the Iocket
I gave you...
it becomes the key.
Thank you
for bringing it down here.
CLARlSSE/ l also
came to apologize...
for the way l spoke to you
about the beach incident.
It was judgementaI of me.
I didn't pause
to verify the facts.
That's aII right, Grandma.
I've been thinking about it
a great deaI...
and the truth is...
I think you'd make
a very fine princess.
You know, people think...
princesses are supposed
to wear tiaras...
marry the prince,
always look pretty...
and live happily ever after...
but it's so much more
than that.
It's a reaI job.
You are an extraordinary person,
Grandma...
but I don't think
I'm meant to do this.
I wouId be so afraid...
that I wouId disappoint
the peopIe of Genovia...
and I couIdn't bear...
to disappoint you again.
WeII, as I said...
I have faith in you.
-I'm a writer.
-Ah!
I write soaps--
soap opera.
Mm-hmm.
Did you ever see
''MiddIe House Road''?
No. No, no.
It's a big hit.
I wrote a character
just Iike you once.
He was a spy.
I'm not a spy.
That's what
the character said.
MlA/
l'll see you tonight, then.
CLARlSSE/ Mm-hmm.
Hahh!
CLARISSE:
I do have one favor to ask.
I need you to formaIIy
renounce your titIe...
for the press
at the baII, you know?
-Make a speech?
-Mm-hmm.
Do you think that maybe...
considering
my history with the press...
it wouId be better
if you did it?
AmeIia, you wouIdn't
stop driving your Mustang...
just because a coupIe of insects
hit the windshieId?
Besides,
Iook how far you've come...
and l'll be
right there with you.
l'll have Joseph
pick you up at 7 /00.
No. Um...
I promised
I'd Iet my mom drive me.
She wants to drive me
to my first baII...
or something.
AII right.
I'II see you there, then.
Mm-hmm.
Grandma?
I am sorry.
Oh, my dear.
You are first and foremost
my granddaughter.
Ah!
CLARlSSE/
Please don't be late.
Hold on,
but don't hold too tight
Let go and soon
it'll be all right
Don't run away
from what your heart is sayin'
No
Be strong and face
what you're afraid of
Come on, show 'em
what you're made of
l know it's hard
when your hope is gone
But you gotta
keep holdin' on
Hold on
You're gonna make it
You gotta be strong now
Thank you, Dad,
but I can't be a princess.
I don't make speeches...
and I'm not
CIarisse RenaIdi and...
and l just...
l can't do it, OK?
l'm scared.
CHARLO TTE/ Joseph.
CharIotte, Miss Kawa.
Nice to meet you.
Pardon me.
I have to get the band ready.
Of course.
ShouId you be going
to get Princess Mia?
Mia toId CIarisse her mother
wouId be bringing her.
HeIen just arrived and said
Mia was waiting for you.
She's going to run.
MlA/ Come on, Fat Louie.
Time to pack.
Let's get your things.
Louie, what have you
got there?
Come on, Louie.
We're going on a trip.
We're going to CoIorado...
where we can cIimb
some reaI rocks.
We are so out of here, Louie.
''My dearest daughter...
''today is
your sixteenth birthday.
''Congratulations.
''l present you
with this diary...
''to fill the pages with
your special thoughts--
''special thoughts
of your wonderful life. ''
PHlLLlPE'S VOlCE/
''lt is a custom in my family...
''to pass on a piece of wisdom
when one reaches this age.
''l pass it on to you as
my father passed it on to me.
''Amelia, courage is not
the absence of fear...
''but rather the judgement...
''that something else
is more important than fear.
''The brave
may not live forever...
''but the cautious
do not live at all.
''From now on,
you'll be traveling the road...
''between
who you think you are...
''and who you can be.
''The key is to allow yourself
to make the journey.
''l also want you to know...
''l loved your mother
very much...
''and still think of her often.
''Happy birthday, my Mia.
''All my love, your father. ''
NELSON/ And there's
Countess Puck of Austria...
as the glamorous
continue to arrive...
at the Genovian
lndependence Ball.
Despite the threat of rain...
the big turnout includes
the mayor of San Francisco...
and a Genovian pear juggler.
The future of Genovia...
is in the hands of
young Mia Thermopolis.
Her decision tonight will
affect the queen, the court...
and all the people of
this small but proud country.
Do you think
it's gonna rain on us?
It never comes down
on WiIIie Brown.
Ha ha! Thank you.
UmbreIIas up!
CHARLO TTE/ And that's enough
pear juggling.
The trip is off, Louie.
Oh! Perfect.
Unh!
Oh, come on.
Come on, baby.
LORD JEROME/
Genovians, you know...
are famous for
their impeccable taste in art.
AIso for their cheese.
Maybe it's string cheese.
Don't do this, baby.
Unh!
Gotcha!
Oh!
MlA/ Sorry, Mr. Robutusen!
Here you go.
It's aIready paid for.
I didn't order a pizza.
I'm sorry about that.
No, you must've.
UnIess there's another
MichaeI Moscovitz Iiving here.
We get a caII, we deIiver.
That's our motto.
You don't make the pizza?
No, no. I just deIiver 'em.
Press passes.
Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, hi.
Where are you from?
''Teen Scene'' magazine.
Oh, good, good.
MAN/
The queen has entered.
Do we have any news on
the Von Troken matter?
It'II be decided tonight, ma'am.
I'm afraid so.
Where is she?!
She went somewhere!
I know nothing!
Nothing? Come here.
Oh, what? What?
TaIk to me.
She went that way,
then that way.
Two minutes ago.
Thank you very much.
Do we have any probIems?
No. Everything's perfect.
Perfect. It's wonderfuI.
You're not very good
at Iying, CharIotte.
No, I'm not, Your Majesty.
But the garden Iooks beautifuI.
Thank you.
Come on, baby.
You can make it.
Yes, come on! Yes!
No. Come on, baby.
Baby, pIease, come on.
CHARLO TTE/ There's no answer
at Princess Mia's house...
and I couIdn't get Joseph
on the ceII phone.
There's too much static
from the storm.
The press is starting
to compIain...
about making their deadIines.
If she's not here in 10 minutes,
I'II make the announcement.
CHARLO TTE/ Yes, ma'am.
It's OK. She'II be fine.
She's gonna get here.
Is this punishment
for driving without...
a Iicensed driver
in the front seat?!
I am invisibIe and I am wet.
The press was wondering
if it wouId be possibIe--
No. No interviews untiI
Iater in the evening.
Yes, ma'am.
SUKl/ And we're meeting
Baroness and Baron Von Troken.
Is it true if the teenager
refuses the princess-ship...
your famiIy wiII take over
the country of Genovia?
Yes. They must have
a Iegitimate...
RenaIdi bIood reIative
or we ruIe.
No, ma'am.
Then it's time.
Catch a falling star
And put it in your pocket
Never let it fade away
You wouIdn't happen to be
running away, wouId you?
What? Dressed Iike this?
No. I'm going to a baII.
Good. Get in.
MO TAZ/
Her Majesty, the Queen.
CLARlSSE/ My fellow Genovians
and honored guests...
good evening.
l apologize for the delay
and--oh, hello--
And may l say...
welcome to our grand Genovian
lndependence Day ball.
CHARLO TTE/
There's no time to change.
You look fine.
JOE: Pretty and fine.
Just fine.
-Oh!
-No running.
-PIease, no running. Good.
-It's nice.
...a very special moment.
Thank you so much
for your patience.
I have an announcement
to make.
-My granddaughter--
-Ahem.
-She's here!
-I see.
I wouId Iike to announce that
my granddaughter has arrived.
With a fascinating expIanation
as to her wardrobe, I'm sure.
She's styIing a wet,
sort of grunge-Iook hairdo...
and is wearing a sweatshirt,
jeans, and Docs.
Mia, wouId you care
to say a few words?
Um, yes.
Why didn't we dress Iike her?
We Iook Iike idiots.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Do you think they're trying
to save money on the gown?
Hi--er, uh, heIIo.
I'm Mia. Um...
It stopped raining.
Get your tiara ready.
I'm reaIIy no good
at speechmaking.
NormaIIy I get so nervous
that I faint...
or run away or sometimes
I even get sick.
But you reaIIy
didn't need to know that.
But I'm not so afraid
anymore.
My father heIped me.
EarIier this evening,
I had every intention...
of giving up my cIaim
to the throne...
and my mother heIped me
by teIIing me that it was OK...
and by supporting me Iike
she has for my entire Iife.
But...
then I wondered how I'd feeI...
after abdicating my roIe
as Princess of Genovia.
WouId I feeI reIieved
or wouId I feeI sad?
And then I reaIized...
how many stupid times a day
I use the word ''I.''
ln fact,
probably all l ever do...
is think about myseIf.
And how Iame is that...
when there are 7 biIIion
other peopIe on the pIanet--
Ahem.
Ooh. Sorry.
I'm going too fast.
But then l thought...
if I cared about
the other 7 biIIion out there...
instead of just me...
that's probabIy
a much better use of my time.
See, if l were
Princess of Genovia...
then my thoughts...
and the thoughts of peopIe
smarter than me...
would be much better heard
and just maybe...
those thoughts couId be
turned into actions.
So this morning
when I woke up...
I was Mia ThermopoIis.
But now...
I choose to be forevermore...
AmeIia Mignonette
ThermopoIis RenaIdi...
Princess of Genovia.
I hope you didn't order
your stationery yet.
This was my very first tiara.
I was rather fond of it.
I'm hoping you wiII be, too.
Oh. Grandma,
but you had it aIready.
How did you know
I'd even be here?
Because I recognize
the same spirit in you...
as someone eIse I know.
Who?
Me.
Ah, you made it.
You bet your Iife,
you big, taII string bean.
Here. PaoIo here
to save the day.
Genovia
The land l call my home
Genovia, Genovia
Forever will your banner wave
Her Majesty,
Queen Clarisse...
and Her RoyaI Highness,
AmeIia, Princess of Genovia.
I think perhaps we'd better
get you dried off now.
Thank you.
No Ionger does Mia stand for
''Missing In Action.''
Genovia has a new princess.
They had the same idea I had...
but now the garden
is ''occupado.''
Why me?
Because you saw me
when I was invisibIe.
And just because I'm royaI...
doesn't mean
I'm any different.
Come on,
I'm reaIIy the same person.
Yes, I wiII have
to Iive in Genovia...
but I'II stiII go
to schooI and...
You showed me faith
is not gone
l don't need wind
to help me fly
Miracles happen
once in a while
When you believe
You showed me dreams
come to life
That taking a chance
on us was right
All things will come
with a little time
When you believe
MlA/ Dear diary...
today is my first official day
as Princess of Genovia.
We'll land in a few hours...
and l'll meet the parliament
and the people...
before beginning
my royal duties.
Mom is, of course,
moving to Genovia with me...
and will continue painting--
without the balloons.
Lilly and Michael are spending
their summer vacation...
at our--
can you believe it--palace.
They're even having
my Mustang brought over...
which l can legally drive
in two weeks.
Grandma's so glad
to be going home.
And Joseph? Well,
he's watching nearby as usual.
Everybody's got
pre-coronation jitters...
including me.
Everybody, that is,
ex cept Fat Louie.
He's totally adapted
to being a royal.
l guess he was one all along.
JOSEPH/ Princess,
look out the window...
and welcome to Genovia.
Miracles happen
once in a while
When you believe
You showed me
dreams come to life
That taking a chance
on us was right
All things will come
with a little time
When you believe
l know sometimes you feel
Like you don't fit in
And this world doesn't know
What you have within
When l look at you
l see something rare
A rose
that can go anywhere
And there's no one l know
that can compare
What makes you different
Makes you beautiful
What's there inside you
Shines through to me
ln your eyes l see
All the love l'll ever need
All l need of love
What makes you different
Makes you beautiful to me
So beautiful
What makes you
What makes you different
Makes you beautiful
To me
Everything you do
is beautiful
Love is shining
right through me
Everything in you
is beautiful
Beautiful
To me
To me
Ooh
Mm-mmm
Mm-hmm
l know that
you're searching for answers
Afraid that
you'll be left behind
But you can't rush time
You got to wait in line
ln time,
the answers you'll find
You'll get your wings
at the right time
Each of us
must learn how to fly
Gotta move on from
what's breaking your heart
Don't let your life
pass you by
