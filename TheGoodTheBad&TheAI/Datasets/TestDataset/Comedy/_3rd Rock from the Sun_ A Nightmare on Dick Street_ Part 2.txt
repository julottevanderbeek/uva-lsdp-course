Tommy:
Dick was upset when Mary
decided to go to Borneo for a year.
What's so great
about Borneo?
He later had a horrible nightmare about
telling Mary the truth that he's an alien.
And, having never
dreamt before,
losing his mind.  Mary!
To calm him down, a doctor
prescribed tranquilizers.
Dick quickly became addicted
and lost touch with reality.
Not knowing
what to do,
we tried to contact the big
, giant head for permission
to return to the home planet
for maintenance.
Sally also dreamt
for the first time
and became convinced
that she had killed Don.
- Don? Don? Where's Don?
- Sally.
Oh, Don!
I didn't kill you?
I didn't kill you!
No, you just
emasculated me.
- I've got to see something.
- Sally!
No feathers.
Oh-- oh, my god.
Sally, uh, you're gonna
have to calm down.
Oh, don't you see, Don? You're
alive, which means it's my brain,
my sick, twisted brain.
I could be capable of
anything. Anything at all!
There's only one hope, Don.
I've got to get on the pill.
Um, this isn't how
I expected this to happen,
but hey.
Dick's on the pill, and it
seems to be working for him.
Okay, you lost me
again.
Uh, I'll call you when
I'm not myself anymore.
Okay, so she's crazy,
but she's got legs
up to her face!
- I love Tv.
- Mmm, me too.
What do you say
we turn it on?
It's even better on.
Oh, man.
The high commander and the
lieutenant are incapacitated.
You know what that means?
The information officer
takes over, and that's me.
Permission to speak,
high commander.
- Permission granted.
- Well, we might as well
just take this mission,
roll it up and stick it--
incoming message
from the big,
giant head.
"Your request to return home for
emergency maintenance has been authorized."
- Yes!
- "The time-space portal will open tomorrow evening
between 8:51
and 8:53 P.M.
Earth time.
On your journey home,
we will be showing
starring Kevin Costner
and Rene Russo."
Well, that settles it.
We're going.
"The big, giant head looks forward
to reading your comprehensive report
on the history
of human civilization."
Oh, no.
- Tommy.
- Miss frost.
- You missed class today.
- I-- yeah, I did.
That's so unlike you. You're usually
the first to come and the last to leave.
Yeah.
Miss frost,
I'm gonna be transferring
to another, uh,
district soon,
but, um, before I do,
I was just wondering
if you wanted
to take me up on my offer.
You mean, your offer to let me be
the one to usher you into manhood?
- The offer still stands.
- Thank you, no.
I'm wearin' her down.
Tommy, how's
the report coming?
I'm just putting the
finishing touches on it now.
Man, am I gonna be glad to
get this thing off my shoes.
Sally's voice, echoing:
- Dicks's voice: help!
- Sally's voice: help me, Tommy!
How can I help you?
I'm supposed to be studying.
Sally:
Sally's voice:
-
- Harry's voice: help us!
Dick, Sally together:
- Dick: you can do it!
-
Dick's voice:
Sally's voice:
Dick's voice:
Dick:
Help us, Tommy!
Bali hai
-  may call you
- Dick: oh, not good.
-
- Sally:
-
- Dick: come on, now!
-  In your heart
- Dick:
Stop it!
-  Will tell you
- Come on!
come away
Bali hai
will whisper
- Tommy!
-  Here am I
your special island
come to me
come to me
- don't do it, Tommy!
-  Bali hai
Bali hai
Bali hai.
- Harry:
Oh, Dick, Sally!
It's happening to me too!
I'm falling apart at the seams!
Oh, this chair feels all soft on my bottom.
Will you listen to me?
This is serious!
You know what's good for
serious things? One of those.
Oh, no, no, no, Tommy.
Don't do it.
Look, Tommy.
Look how pretty they are.
And they have a line down the
middle where you can break them in half.
- So you can take half?
- No, so you can take one and a half.
No, Tommy,
you got to be strong.
You're right. As acting high
commander, I order you to turn over the pills.
Oh, he thinks
he's high commander.
That's so cute.
Let's give him a salute.
Harry,
get rid of 'em!
No, not that way!
Tommy, Harry,
I want to thank you for
getting us off that pill.
- Oh, you feel better?
- Oh, I feel horrible.
But at least I feel.
Well, we just have to keep it
together for a few more hours.
- What do you mean?
- While we were "out,"
Tommy got a hold
of the big, giant head.
- We leave tonight at 8:53.
- Last chance for ice cream.
- When are we coming back?
- I don't know, I didn't ask.
Who knows? The service
department's always backed up.
Yep. They'll probably
have to send out for parts.
Could be a week, could be
a year, could be 200 years.
- What about Mary?
- Oh, she'll be dead.
I can't leave her
without saying good-bye.
- Wait! Dick, there isn't time.
- Sure, there is.
No, listen, I know you,
Dick. You're gonna go there,
you're gonna get all ooey-gooey
, and you'll miss the transport.
That is such
a lie!
Well, remember one thing:
Harry is the transmitter,
and he's coming
with us, okay?
So without him, you'd
be stranded here forever.
Don't worry. I'm gonna steel myself up,
march in there, and just do the headlines--
"love ya, miss ya,
good-Bye."
And maybe a little second-
base action, but that's it.
Hello, Mary.
I came by to say
I will miss you
terribly.
Really? Is there anything else I should know?
Yes. I care about you deeply and I love you.
Of course.
Do you mind if I pack?
- What?
- Nothing.
I bit my fist.
In conclusion, I'll always
carry a locket of your Dna,
and you'll be glad to know
that the vision of your naked body
will be with me
for all time.
Well, I guess there's
nothing else to say but good bye.
- Good bye, Dick.
- Good bye, Mary.
I'm walking away now.
No.
No, this is not
how it ends.
This has been a long and difficult
journey, and it will not end this way.
There will be no tepid farewells for us.
I need you, Mary--
your eyes, your face,
your every nook and cranny--
especially your cranny.
You are Mary world,
and I love Mary world.
It's the happiest
place on earth.
Oh, come on, Mary! Let's
take a spin on those teacups!
- I don't want to go!
- I don't want to go either!
- Where are you going?
- Uh, nowhere.
Maybe I am
losing my mind,
but while there's a little
left, I want to marry you.
- Marry me?
- Sure, I'll marry you. We'll be so happy.
This is so great!
I know!
- He's late.
- We're gonna have to leave him behind.
Nobody gets left behind.
Not on my watch.
- Then what do you suggest?
- Well, 20 feet of rope and a blunt object.
There's rope in the basement. Let's
go get it. Harry, you keep packing,
and don't fall asleep
on the job.
"I'm miss bossy.
I get to tell everybody
what to do."
Life has been
good to me
I've got very few
complaints so far
life has been
good to me
hope you're as happy
wherever you are
I got the blue sky
every mornin'
a big, yellow moon
at night
I always do
whatever I want to
and everything I do
it always
turns out right
hey, hey
hey, hey
hey, hey
hey, hey
hey, hey
hey, hey
hey, hey
hey, hey
life has been
good to me
man, I would not
change a thing
Female chorus:
life has
been good to me
life has been
good to me
can't wait to see
what tomorrow will bring
in every life
a little rain
must surely fall
I'm here to say
that there's a rainbow
just around every corner
life has been
good to me
well, I admit
I've had a ball
Female chorus:
-
life has been
good to me
I never worry 'bout
Nothin' at all
I got some good friends
they adore me
and know how
to treat me right
I got a good gal
waitin' for me
I've won every fight
I've been in
and it always turns out
that I was right
ah.
Hey, hey
hey, hey
hey, hey
life has been
good to me
Female chorus:
life has been
good to me
Thanks, Mrs. Dubcek. I
wouldn't ask you to let me in
if I didn't think
Sally really needed help.
You know, I used to date
a police officer.
Maybe you know him--
teddy rubino.
He's the guy whose wife put a
slug in him for fooling around.
Dear god!
Stand back.
- I'm afraid he's dead.
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure. I'm a cop.
- Hi, Don.
Damn it, I got to learn
how to take a pulse.
- Don.
- Sally, where have you been? I've been looking for you.
Hold that thought.
Listen, Harry, get a hammer.
- Tommy, get the sack. I'll get the string cheese.
- "String cheese"?
Oh, god, I'm starving!
I'd like to propose
a toast.
To Dick and Mary. May you
both be as happy as I am.
Uh...
Dick, could I speak to you
for a minute?
Sally, uh, sure.
Excuse me. Uh, don't get married without me.
Oh, I'm glad you came.
I was-- I was gonna call.
Oh, cut the crap, Dick. Listen,
you're a mess. You're coming with us.
- We're going home.
- This is my home.
- What?
- Mary and I are getting married.
What you talkin' about,
Willis?
I've made my decision.
I'd rather die here with Mary
than risk losing her forever.
Oh, okay, all right.
You're the high commander,
and we respect
your decision.
- Get him!
- What the hell?
- Oh, uh, hello, Mary.
Don't worry. The "besacking" of the
groom is a time-honored tradition.
What kind of tradition?
I'm gonna go
with "Jewish."
Okay. Dick, we have to go. We have guests.
- All right.
- Dick, are you sure,
absolutely sure you want
to go back to the party?
Absolutely.
Well, this is
good bye, then.
It's just cake and champagne.
He'll be home in half an hour.
Oh, yeah. True.
- So I'll see you in a half an hour.
- Sounds good.
Pick up some milk
on the way home, hmm?
I will.
I promise.
- I'll be at the mall if you need me.
- Don't stay long.
It's a school night,
and I worry.
Come to the store,
Dick.
Our coupons are
in your car.
They've always been
in your car!
For crying out loud,
he's just getting married.
Oh, yeah.
Well, we got to go.
The store closes at 8:53.
Good bye!
Will they be
living with us?
I never dreamed I'd see the
day Dr. Albright settled down.
Mary hasn't
settled down.
She's just settled.
I know this sounds
strange,
but I had a dream you asked me to marry you.
- You had a what?
- A dream.
I was drowning
in a swimming pool,
and my father was
the lifeguard,
and he was saving me,
and I looked up
and it wasn't him,
it was you.
And you were wearing
flippers
and black socks,
and you offered me
a ring.
Mary, it's contagious!
You're as crazy as I am!
I know it's crazy. It woke
me up out of a sound sleep.
Yes! That's when it
strikes-- When you're asleep!
Well, yeah, Dick. That's
when most people dream.
"Most people dream"?
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.
Nothing's the matter
with me.
And there's nothing the matter
with Tommy and Sally.
Oh, my god! There's nothing
the matter with any of us!
- Where are you going?
- Home! Before it's too late!
Hello? Sally?
Harry? Tommy?
"Dear Dick, of all the
people we've worked for,
you were the best,
you stupid, stupid man."
And they're gone.
I miss them.
"P.S.: We got you a
wedding gift. Hope you like it."
A toaster.
The toaster
from the kitchen.
-
-
You left the party so
suddenly. Is everything all right?
Oh, Mary.
I chose to stay with you
until death do us part,
which, as it turns out, is a
hell of a lot longer than I thought.
- What?
- Which is fine. It's just fine.
- Where is your family?
- They took off.
And it's all
my fault.
But I'm gonna find them.
No matter how long it takes,
no matter what I have to do,
I'm going to find them
and get them back--
this I vow!
Where'd they go?
Pizza.
