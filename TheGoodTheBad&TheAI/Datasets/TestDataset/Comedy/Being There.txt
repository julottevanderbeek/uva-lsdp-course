CARTOON VOlCE: I dare you to stop me
in my Super Cop Clobberer.
CARTOON VOlCE : Anybody who'd try it
has to be totally stupid.
CARTOON VOlCE 2: Stupid?
Hey, Mumbly, come back.
CARTOON VOlCE 2: And make it snappy.
NEWSCASTER:...snow over the weekend,
and the blizzard is one of the worst...
...as you can see,
one of the worst in that city's history.
They have not been lucky in the Midwest,
as soon as they dig out...
...another storm hits and there's one
out west that might be in soon.
We've been very lucky, though.
Every time it snows--
CHARACTER: Your friend's out here.
BlG BlRD: Friends? I have no friends.
CHARACTER: Big Bird, we came
to see you drive.
BlG BlRD: It's too late now, isn't it?
Good morning, Louise.
He's dead, Chance.
LOUlSE: The old man's dead.
I see.
LOUlSE: He wasn't breathing...
...and he's cold as a fish.
I touched him, just to see.
Chance?
Then l...
...covered him up.
Pulled a sheet over his head.
Oh, Lord!
What a morning.
Yes, Louise.
It looks like it's going to snow.
Have you seen the garden?
CHANCE: It feels like it's going to snow--
LOUlSE: Damn it, boy.
Is that all you've got to say?
That old man is lying up there
dead as hell...
...and it just don't make
any difference to you.
BlG BlRD: I'm not sure I understand.
Lord, Chance....
LOUlSE: I'm sorry for yelling like I did.
No, sir. I just don't know
what I was expecting.
I suppose I better gather you up
some breakfast.
Yes, please. I'm very hungry, Louise.
I'll make you some eggs.
CAPTAlN KANGAROO: There are lots
of animals in the barnyard.
Want to go see them?
WOMAN:
"Sealy Posturepedic morning"
ANNOUNCER: Feeling so good it shows.
Because Posturepedic is designed...
...in cooperation with leading orthopedic
surgeons for no morning backache...
...from sleeping on a too-soft mattress.
WOMAN:  "It's a
Sealy Posturepedic morning"
WOMAN: Keep in the shade, Alvin.
ALVlN: Yes, ma 'am.
WOMAN: I won't have the horses
standing in the sun. You hear me?
WOMAN: Stay in your seat.
ALVlN: Yes, ma 'am.
WOMAN: Keep your hat and gloves on.
ALVlN: Yes, ma 'am.
WOMAN: And your coat buttoned.
ALVlN: Yes, ma 'am.
Yes, ma 'am.
CHANCE: Yes, ma'am.
Ain't you the gentleman this morning.
I'm going to go now, Chance.
CHANCE: Yes.
You're going to need somebody.
LOUlSE: You ought to find yourself a lady,
Chance.
Guess it ought to be an old lady.
You ain't going to do
a young one any good.
Not with that little thing of yours.
LOUlSE: You're always going to be a little
boy, ain't you?
Goodbye, Chance.
Goodbye, Louise.
HAYES: Will you give me a tour?
FRANKLlN: Gladly.
The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom.
That'll be stop number one.
He and my father used to ride together,
back in the '30s.
Before I was born.
You hear that?
MC: It's a new car.
NEWSCASTER: This morning,
the President met with...
...foreign dignitaries and cultural exchange
students from the Republic of China.
He presented them with a statue
of the American eagle...
...our symbol of peace and freedom
throughout the world.
The President warmly encouraged
future trade relations--
FRANKLlN: Why, hello.
We thought we heard something.
I'm Thomas Franklin.
Hello, Thomas. I'm Chance, the gardener.
-The gardener?
-Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.
Yes.
Yes.
We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts.
The law firm handling the estate.
Yes, Thomas, I understand.
Are you waiting for someone?
An appointment?
Yes. Louise will bring me my lunch.
All kidding aside, Mr. Chance,
may I ask just what you're doing here?
I live here.
There is no mention of a gardener.
According to our inventories, there hasn't
been a man employed here since 1933.
Except for a Mr. Joe Saracini...
...a brick mason,
who did some repairs to a wall.
He was here for two and a half days
in 1952.
Yes. I remember Joe.
He was very fat, had short hair...
...and showed me pictures
from a funny little book.
-Some pictures?
-Yes.
Of men and women.
Just how long have you been living here,
Mr. Chance?
Ever since I can remember.
Ever since I was a child
I've worked in this garden.
HAYES: Then you really are a gardener?
My roses.
We will need some proof
of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
You have me, I'm here.
That's where Joe fixed the wall.
Are you related to the deceased?
I don't think so.
That's a nice car.
Do you drive it, Mr. Chance?
I've never been in an automobile.
You've never been in a car?
No.
I've never been allowed
outside of the house.
TV VOlCE: You can call me Ray,
or you can call me Jay....
I used to listen to the radio.
Then the old man started giving me
television sets.
This one has a remote control.
TV VOlCE: Maybe there's another
gum machine someplace.
You see? This is my bed.
This is my bathroom.
This is my sink.
This is my toilet.
This is my bathtub.
Here is my closet.
You have a very handsome wardrobe.
Yes.
I'm allowed to go to the attic
and wear any of the old man's clothes.
-They fit me very well, don't they?
-Yes.
It's amazing how those clothes
have come back into style.
Why is the bed like this?
I like to sleep with my head
facing the north.
I sleep better that way.
Yes, I've heard about that. Could you
show us something with your address?
But this is facing west.
-What is facing west?
-The bed.
I see.
Mr. Chance, I'd like to know
what sort of claim...
...you're planning to make
against the deceased's estate.
The garden is a healthy one, Thomas.
I have no claim.
I see. Would you be willing
to sign a paper to that effect?
I don't know how to sign, Thomas.
Very well, Mr. Chance,
I have no alternative but to inform you...
...that this house is now closed.
If, indeed, you have resided here,
you have no legal right to remain.
You'll have to move out by,
let's say, noon tomorrow.
I don't understand "move out."
Call me, or have your attorney call me...
...if you change your mind about signing.
Come on, Sally, let's grab a bite.
What about medical records?
Could you give us the name
of your doctor or your dentist?
I have no doctor or dentist.
I see.
Good day, Mr. Chance.
Good day, Sally. Good day, Thomas.
ANNOUNCER: You're doing new things,
and you need the Washington Post to help.
MAN: Pardon me for intruding at a time like
this, but were you very close to Max?
MAX: Are you kidding?
We were inseparable.
HOST: Jogger's knee and swimmer's....
We have tennis elbow, jogger's knee,
and simmer's....
And swimmer's what?
CONTESTANT: I'm sorry.
All I can think of is trunks.
NARRATOR: Jim 's back was broken in three
places, his skull was fractured...
...and his chest crushed. He's a paraplegic.
But after a year in the hospital,
he went back to school...
...got his master's degree
and now looks to the future.
MALE VOlCE: I get depressed, you know,
this kind of thing...
...and it's momentary,
it usually hits at night.
Excuse me.
I'm very hungry.
Could you give me some lunch?
It's an all-girl show, sir.
It's an all-girl show.
Come right in. It's an all-girl show.
CHANCE: Excuse me.
Could you please tell me
where I could find a garden to work in?
A garden? What are you growing, man?
CHANCE: There is much to be done
during the winter.
I should start the seeds for the spring
and work the soil.
ABBAZ: Bullshit!
Who sent you here, boy?
Did that chicken-shit asshole Raphael
send you, boy?
No.
Mr. Thomas Franklin told me
I must leave the old man's house.
CHANCE: He's dead, you know.
ABBAZ: Dead, my ass.
You tell that asshole,
if he got something to tell me...
...to get his ass down here himself.
Got that, boy?
BOY 1 : TV changer, man.
BOY 2: What you got?
Now move, honky,
before I cut your white ass.
If I see Raphael,
I will give him your message.
-Do that.
-Good day.
Excuse me. That tree is very sick.
It needs care.
Yes, sir. I'll report it right away.
Thank you.
-Good day, sir.
-Good day.
W-4.
DAVlD: I'm very sorry, sir, I didn't see you.
CHANCE: Can't move. My leg.
JEFFERY: This is terrible, sir.
I hope you're not badly injured.
CHANCE: No. I'm not badly injured.
But my leg is very sore.
JEFFERY: It's not broken, is it?
CHANCE: I hope not.
DAVlD: Perhaps I should call an ambulance.
JEFFERY: Let's have a look. Do you mind?
CHANCE: No. I'd like to look.
EVE: What's happened?
My goodness, your leg!
Yes.
It should be examined.
We could take you to a hospital.
CHANCE: There's no need for the hospital.
EVE: A doctor should look at that.
I insist. We'll take him to a hospital.
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Rand.
I never saw the man.
EVE: It's really no one's fault, David.
DAVlD: Thank you, ma'am.
I've never ridden in an automobile before.
JEFFERY: I assure you, sir,
David is a very careful driver.
-I understand.
-Very good.
These situations can be so trying.
Everyone seems to make such a to-do
out of a simple little accident.
Is your leg feeling any better?
No, it isn't.
I see.
This is just like television,
only you can see much further.
Why don't you come to our house
and we could take care of you there?
Your house?
My husband's been very ill. The doctor
and the nurses are staying with us.
Hospitals can be so impersonal.
CHANCE: I agree.
EVE: Fine.
That'll save a lot of unnecessary fuss and
it'll be that much more pleasant for you.
We'll go right on home.
And, Jeffery, please call
and tell them we're on our way.
JEFFERY: Yes, ma'am.
EVE: Would you care for a drink?
Yes, please. I'm very thirsty.
Thank you. May I watch television, please?
Why, yes. Certainly.
BOWSER: And now,
the piece of resistance....
May I ask your name?
Chance.
Chance?
Chance, the gardener.
Chauncey Gardiner?
Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
Are you related to Basil
and Perdita Gardiner?
No, I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
They are such a wonderful couple.
My husband and l
are very good friends of theirs.
We often visit their island.
Thank you.
Did you lose something?
Yes, I lost my remote control.
I use it to change the channels.
I'm sorry.
You wouldn't think of driving
without your rear-view mirror...
...and yet some people still drive
without a fuzz buster.
When they unwrapped the chopsticks
to be used by the Chinese guests...
...the packages were clearly stamped
"Made in Taiwan. "
I know it's important to stay informed
of all the latest events, but...
...I find there's so much to assimilate
it can become quite muddling.
NEWSCASTER: They placed the chopsticks
at the table. If the Chinese were upset--
MAlD: Good evening, ma'am.
Wilson, will you take Mr. Gardiner
to the third-floor guest suite?
Yes, ma'am.
I'll see you after Dr. Allenby
has a look at your leg.
Thank you. Yes.
I've never been in one of these before.
It's one of Mr. Rand's. Since he's been ill.
I see.
Does it have a television?
No. But Mr. Rand does have one
with an electric motor.
That way, he can get around by himself.
How long do we stay in here?
How long?
I don't know.
We'll see what the doctor says.
I've seen it done before,
in a film on television.
This won't hurt at all.
It did hurt.
There's no apparent damage to the bone.
But to be sure, we'll do an x-ray.
X-ray?
By the way, Mr. Gardiner,
I'd like to ask you something straight out.
-Straight out?
-Yes, sir.
Are you planning on making
any sort of claim against the Rands?
Claim.
That's what Thomas asked me.
Thomas?
You can pull your trousers up now.
Who's Thomas?
Thomas Franklin. He's an attorney.
-An attorney?
-Yes.
Then you wish to handle this matter
through your attorneys?
There's no need for a claim.
I don't even know what they look like.
ALLENBY: Well, then.
You caught me off guard there,
I must admit.
Thank you.
ALLENBY: Now, the only thing we have
to look out for is minor hemorrhaging...
...which isn't serious,
but could cause trouble later on.
Tell me, Mr. Gardiner...
...would it be possible for you
to stay here for a day or two...
...so we could keep an eye on it?
Yes, I could stay here.
-Does this house have a garden?
-Why, yes. Many.
Good.
Keep your weight off that leg,
Mr. Gardiner.
Mr. Wilson, wheel Mr. Gardiner in
for x-rays after you've finished unpacking.
WlLSON: Yes, Doctor.
ALLENBY: Thank you.
Ever watch a game on TV and see
the players chugging down this stuff?
Ever wonder why?
I miss you so when I'm out.
How're you feeling?
EVE: No headaches?
No, it's been a fairly good day.
RAND: Better than yours, so I've been told.
EVE: You heard about it?
I may be a shut-in, but....
I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
It was nothing, really.
It just sounded worse than it was.
EVE: And Mr. Gardiner
is a very reasonable man.
Reasonable....
I'd like to meet a reasonable man
for a change.
Why don't you ask this Robinson
for dinner?
Gardiner. Gardiner. Chauncey.
Chauncey Gardiner.
RAND: Gardiner.
You think you're well enough
for dinner, Ben?
Constance, I want fresh blood for dinner.
Yes, sir.
I'll have them set another place.
My God, Eve, you'll freeze.
EVE: No. I just....
I just wanted to get some fresh air.
How's Mr. Gardiner?
Doesn't seem to be too serious.
But it's a rather large contusion
and I'd like to keep an eye on him...
...so I suggested that he stay here
for a couple of days.
EVE: Here?
Mr. Gardiner stay here? Why?
Is that necessary?
Not necessary, but helpful.
ALLENBY: Don't worry,
he might be a breath of fresh air.
He is different, isn't he?
You know, he's very...
...intense.
Perhaps.
Actually, I found him to have
quite a sense of humor.
That's a very small room.
Yes, sir, I guess that's true.
Smallest room in the house.
CHANCE: Yes, I guess that's true.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital.
CHANCE: Thank you.
BlLLlNGS: Can I help you to the table?
CHANCE: Thank you.
CHANCE: I feel very good in here.
RAND: That's the oxygen.
When I first got sick...
...I had this entire room glassed in...
...so they could pump in
some extra oxygen.
Keeps my spirits up.
You must be very ill.
Aplastic anemia.
The bone marrow doesn't supply
enough red blood cells.
Not a damn thing they can do about it.
They can keep me comfortable.
Prolong my life with steroid therapy...
...and these transfusions.
But what makes my blood boil...
...that is, what there is of it...
...is that this is usually...
...a young person's disease.
Here I am getting along in years...
...and I'm about to die
of a young person's disease.
CHANCE: I've never seen anything like this
on television.
Please, lie still, Mr. Gardiner.
RAND: You'll join us for dinner, of course.
Yes, please. Thank you.
I'm very hungry.
Yes, so am l, my boy.
So am l.
Do you know Raphael?
No, sir. I don't believe I do.
Because I have a message for him.
Yes, sir?
A small black man
gave me a message for Raphael.
I still don't believe I know the man,
Mr. Gardiner. Now, please...
...Iie still.
EVE: Is there anyone we could notify
for you?
CHANCE: No.
CHANCE: The old man died and Louise left.
EVE: I'm very sorry.
EVE: I do hope your injury won't prevent
you from attending to business.
Do you need a secretary?
No, thank you.
My house was shut down.
You mean your business was shut down?
Yes.
Shut down and closed by the attorneys.
What did I tell you?
That's exactly what I mean.
The businessman today is at the mercy
of kid lawyers from the SEC.
ALLENBY: It's happening to everyone,
I'm afraid.
The way things are going, they'll probably
legislate the medical profession...
...right out of existence.
Yes. Right out of existence.
Yeah, it's a damn shame.
What are your plans now, Mr. Gardiner?
Or may I call you Chauncey?
Chauncey's fine.
So then, what are your plans, Chauncey?
I would like to work in your garden.
I know exactly what he means.
Isn't it wonderful...
...to be with the trees
and the flowers like that?
I never had much feel for it, myself.
I'm a very good gardener.
It's such a pleasant way
to forget one's troubles.
Isn't that what any businessman is?
A gardener.
He...
...works on...
...flinty soil...
...to make it productive...
...with the labor of his own hands.
He waters it...
...with the sweat of his own brow.
He makes a thing of value for his family...
...and for the community.
Yes, indeed, Chauncey,
a productive businessman...
...is a laborer in the vineyard.
I know exactly what you mean.
The garden that I left was such a place.
I don't have that anymore. All I have left...
...is the room upstairs.
Come on, now, wait a minute, Chauncey.
You've got your health.
For God's sake, man, you can't let those
bastards get you down. You've got to fight.
I don't want to hear anymore from you
about that room upstairs.
That's where I'm going, too damn soon.
CHANCE: It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
I'm sure it is.
That's what they say, anyway.
You know...
...there are thousands of businessmen,
large and small...
...in your situation.
I've...
...given the matter a good deal
of consideration for some time.
They've been harassed long enough by...
...inflation, increased taxation...
...all sorts of indecencies.
After all, they're our strongest defense
against the pollutants...
...of our basic freedoms...
...as well as the well-being
of our middle class.
I've been thinking about starting
a financial assistance fund.
Tell me, would you have any ideas
on that subject?
CHANCE: No, Ben.
Reluctant to speak, eh?
I can understand that.
After a man's lost everything...
...anger tends to block out rationality,
for a while.
But, you work on the idea.
Water it.
Fertilize it.
I will, Ben. Yes.
I'm sure you'll sprout some thoughts
in a few days.
CHANCE: I will, Ben. Yes.
Sorry, sir.
I thought you were going to come out with
another jest about the elevator.
Excuse me.
CHANCE: Elevator.
WlLSON: Yes, sir.
Elevator.
EVE: I just wanted you to know
how delighted I am...
...that you're staying with us
and how dreadful I feel about your leg.
Thank you, Eve.
EVE: You lifted Ben's spirits tonight
to such an extent, do you know that?
EVE: He liked you so much. He really did.
CHANCE: Ben is very ill, Eve.
I've seen that before.
EVE: I know.
CHANCE: He reminds me of the old man.
EVE: Does he?
CHANCE: Are you going to leave and close
this house when Ben dies?
EVE: Why, I don't think so.
CHANCE: Goodnight, Eve.
EVE: Goodnight, Chauncey.
-'Morning, Mr. Perkins.
-'Morning, Mr. Riff.
-Nice to see you.
-Thanks.
We have an additional guest with us today,
Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
I see. Shall we set up the communications
in the usual place?
-Of course.
-Okay, let's go to work.
LEWlS: Would you like a car, sir?
Yes, I would like a car.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Send up number seven, please.
Chauncey, there you are.
What are you doing on that leg?
It's fine today, Robert.
Shame on you.
Let me be the judge of that.
Please, sit in the chair.
I swear, between you and Benjamin,
I've got my hands full.
Say, that is coming along.
The swelling's gone down considerably.
Your limousine, sir.
Fine. Thank you.
Are you going somewhere?
No.
Anyway, the President's volunteered
to sit in for Ben at the convention.
Quite a nice gesture.
They're due here soon, I believe.
I know about the President coming.
-You do, do you?
-Yes.
Ben would like me to meet the President.
-He would, would he?
-Yes.
How will I know when it's 10:00?
It's 9:10, now.
And if you don't see a clock...
...I'm sure someone will have the time.
I understand.
I'm going to walk.
Walk? Well, yes, hell yes. Walk.
-You're meeting the President, aren't you?
-Yes.
CHANCE: I've watched him on television.
It's very precise, sir.
It's 10:00.
Thank you, Jim.
Mrs. Aubrey, the President is arriving.
-Up and around this morning, are you?
-I like to walk, Ben.
RAND: That's good news, my boy.
CHANCE: You look much better today.
It's all make-up.
I asked Nurse Teresa to fix me up a bit.
I didn't want the President to think
I would die while he was talking to me.
I see.
Nobody likes a dying man.
Because nobody knows what death is.
You seem to be an exception.
That's one of the things I admire
about you, your admirable balance.
You seem to be a truly peaceful man.
Thank you, Ben. Thank you.
Nurse Teresa did a very good job there.
Mr. Rand, the President is arriving.
Just show the President into the library.
We'll be along in a few minutes.
An old habit that goes along with power:
Keep them waiting.
Not now, Arthur.
But, sir....
I'm going to meet the President...
...on my own two feet.
Shall we go?
That's a very good idea.
RAND: When I was younger,
I had thoughts of public office.
But I found that...
...I was able to contribute more
as a private citizen.
Of course, my...
...wealth provided me
with considerable influence.
But I've tried, believe me, I've tried...
...not to misuse that power.
It's extremely important
that we don't allow ourselves...
...to become blinded to the needs
of our government...
...no matter how strong the temptation.
I've been labeled a kingmaker...
...but I've tried...
...to keep myself open
to the voice of the people.
RAND: And I've remained honest to myself.
RAND: That's the main thing.
SECURlTY: Good morning, Mr. Rand.
RAND: Good morning.
Where the hell is he?
RAND: Mr. President.
Ben.
PRESlDENT: It's good to see you.
You look terrific.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Your visit has helped to raise my spirits.
I've missed you, my friend.
Come, sit down. Take a load off your feet.
Hello, Mr. President.
Hello.
I want you to meet my very dear friend,
Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
On television, Mr. President,
you look much smaller.
I must warn you,
Chauncey's not a man to bandy words.
Oh? Really?
PRESlDENT: Well, Mr. Gardiner, I'm a man
who appreciates a frank discussion.
PRESlDENT: Would you be seated?
CHANCE: Yes, I will.
-Ben, I was wondering if you had a chance--
-Yes?
-Did you happen to have a chance to go--
-Yes?
Ben, did you read my speech?
Overall, pretty good.
But I think, Mr. President,
that it is very dangerous...
...to play around with temporary measures
at a time like this.
Ben, I mean....
RAND: I sympathize with you...
...and I know how difficult it is
to be straightforward.
RAND: But I'll tell you right now, Bobby....
ALLENBY: Hi.
RlFF: Hi. I'm Riff. Secret Service.
Good. Of course.
What you're saying, Ben, is that...
-...you don't think I should take the chance.
-Absolutely not.
Do you agree with Ben, or do you think
we can stimulate growth through...
...temporary incentives?
As long as the roots are not severed...
...all is well.
And all will be well...
...in the garden.
-ln the garden?
-Yes.
In a garden, growth has its season.
First comes spring and summer...
...but then we have...
...fall and winter.
And then we get spring and summer again.
-Spring and summer?
-Yes.
-And fall and winter?
-Yes.
I think what our insightful
young friend is saying...
...is that we welcome the inevitable...
...seasons of nature...
...but we're upset by the seasons
of our economy.
Yes.
There will be growth in the spring.
I must admit, that is one of the most
refreshing and optimistic statements...
...I've heard in a very long time.
I admire your good, solid sense.
That's precisely what we lack
on Capitol Hill.
I must be going.
-This visit has been most enlightening.
-Yes, it has.
PRESlDENT: And Ben, thank you
for your time and thought.
Oh, nonsense.
Thank you for taking time out
with a dying man.
PRESlDENT: No, I won't have any of that.
Why don't you listen
to your friend Chauncey?
This is a time to think of life.
That's right, Mr. President.
PRESlDENT: Now, you take care, Ben.
RAND: And you take care, too, Bobby.
Chauncey.
Bobby.
He's a decent fellow, isn't he,
the President?
Yes. I'm glad he came.
Kaufman, I'll need some information
on Chauncey Gardiner's background.
-Gardiner, yes, sir.
-And I'd like it sometime today.
No problem, chief.
