Ralphie!
Randy!
Down here in two minutes!
And I mean two minutes!
Come on, Ralphie. I got here first!
Cut it out.
They traded Bullfrog. I don't believe it.
What's that?
Well, for Christ's sake,
the Sox traded Bullfrog...
the only player they've got,
for Shottenhoffer.
' Shottenhoffer,
a utility infielder.
Got a whole goddamned team
of utility infielders.
That's nice.
Ralphie, on the double!
Did you hear about this guy
who swallowed a yo-yo?
- Swallowed a yo-yo?
- On a bet.
Some clodhopper down in Griffith, Indiana.
They write the silliest things
in the newspapers.
What do you mean, silly?
I mean that's real news.
That's not like that politics slop.
What is the name
of the Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?
Victor. His name is Victor.
- How the hell did you know that?
- Everybody knows that.
That's another one of your silly puzzles?
Yeah, it's another one of our silly puzzles.
Could be worth $50,000.
What kind is it this time?
Name the great characters
in American literature.
Victor?
The Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?
Flick says he saw some grizzly bears
near Pulaski's candy store.
Hey, Dad!
I'll bet you'll never guess
what I got you for Christmas.
A new furnace.
That's a good one, Dad.
Hurry up,
you're going to be late for school.
Yeah. I'm running late already.
Ralphie, what would you like
for Christmas?
I want an official Red Ryder carbine action
No. Shoot your eye out.
I was just kidding.
Even though Flick is getting one.
I'd just like some Tinkertoys.
BB guns are dangerous.
I don't want anyone shooting his eye out.
Randy, will you eat?
There are starving people in China.
Save us, Ralphie!
I just knew those bad guys...
would be coming for us in the end!
Don't worry, Dad.
As long as I got OI' Blue
What've we got here, folks?
Well, we figure it's Black Bart, Ralph.
Well, just me and my trusty old...
Red Ryder carbine-action
Lucky I've got a compass in the stock.
Well, I think I better have a look here.
Oh, no!
It's OI' Blue!
Oh, no!
Cheese it, boys!
There's another one!
He's a dead-eye, ain't he?
Okay, Ralphie!
You win this time, but we'll be back!
, Bart.
But if you do come back,
you'll be pushing up daisies!
And don't you forget it!
Oldsmobile!
A pile of junk!
That goddamned Olds is froze up again!
That son of a bitch would freeze up
in the middle of summer on the Equator!
- Little pitchers
- Hold it!
It's a clinker!
That blasted, stupid furnace.
Dadgummit!
Damn skates!
For Christ's sake,
open up the damper, will you?
Who the hell turned it
all the way down again?
Blasted!
- Come on, Mom, we're going to be late!
- Just wait, Ralph!
What?
What is it?
What is it?
- What is it?
- I can't put my arms down!
Well, put your arms down
when you get to school.
Hey, Flick! Wait up.
Wait up!
So what are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
Picking goobers?
Hey, listen, smart ass.
I asked my old man about sticking...
your tongue to metal light poles
in winter...
and he says it will freeze right to the pole
just like I told you.
Baloney.
What would your old man know
about anything?
He knows because he once saw a guy
stick his tongue...
to a railroad track on a bet
and the fire department had to come...
to get the guy's tongue off the track
because he couldn't get it off.
Come on, guys, wait up!
Come on, guys!
Come on, guys, wait up!
I can't get up!
I can't get up!
Help!
I can't get out! Help me!
Come on, Flick, wait up for me.
I can't get up!
Come on.
Get up. Sit up. Come on.
You're okay. Come on, let's go.
Come on, you're all right!
Miss Shields!
All right, everyone...
take your seats, please.
Good morning, class.
Good morning, Miss Shields.
Open your books to Page 32.
And as you'll remember, Silas Marner
You're full of beans and so's your old man.
- Says who?
- Says me.
Well, I double-dare you.
Are you kidding?
Stick my tongue to that stupid pole?
That's dumb.
That's 'cause you know it will stick!
You're full of it.
Well, I double dog-dare you!
I triple dog-dare you!
All right, all right.
- Go on, smart ass, and do it!
- I'm going!
This is nothing.
Stuck? Stuck!
Stuck! Stuck!
Jeez!
It really works!
Look at him!
Ralphie, come back!
- Come back! Don't leave me! Come back!
- But the bell rang!
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know! The bell rang!
Where's Flick?
Has anyone seen Flick?
He was at recess, wasn't he?
Ralphie, do you know where Flick is?
I said has anyone seen Flick?
Yes, Esther Jane?
Oh, my God!
Holy cow, it's the fire department!
Wow, it's the cops!
Now, I know that some of you
put Flick up to this.
But, he has refused to say who.
But those who did it know their blame.
And I'm sure the guilt you feel...
is far worse than any punishment
you might receive.
Now, don't you feel terrible?
Don't you feel remorse
for what you have done?
That's all I'm going to say
about poor Flick.
Now, boys and girls,
I'm going to give you an assignment.
I want you to write...
a theme.
'
And I want it handed in
tomorrow morning
Boy, did you see how it stuck?
- Did it hurt, Flick?
- No. I never felt a thing.
It just caught me off-guard.
- You sure were bawling.
- I never bawled!
Baloney.
Scut Farkus!
- Say '
- Uncle!
Louder!
All right.
Who's next?
'
'What I want is a Red Ryder BB gun
with a compass in the stock...
'
Wow, that's great.
'I think that everybody should have
a Red Ryder BB gun.
'They're very good for Christmas.
'I don't think that a football's
a very good Christmas present.'
I've won! I've won!
I won!
I won!
- What?
- A major prize!
I won!
Hey, look at that. Look at that.
A Western Union telegram.
What does this mean here?
It means it's coming tonight!
I called Ernie McClosky
at the freight depot.
He said the telegram was late,
the prize was already there...
he was going to send it on tonight.
Come on. Have a chew, fellas, on me.
It's my gift.
You know, maybe it'll be one of those
Spanish adobe houses down in Coral
Serves you right, you smelly buggers.
Or it could be a bowling alley.
A guy down in Terre Haute
won a bowling alley.
How are they going to deliver
a bowling alley here tonight?
They could send the deed,
for cripesake. I mean...
I didn't expect they were going
to send the whole damn bowling alley.
Yeah, well. How about eating?
I'm starving to death.
Getting rich is hard work, kid. Come on.
Oh, Randy, don't play
with your food, eat it!
Starving people would be happy
to have that.
Can I have some more red cabbage?
Stop playing with your food,
or I'll give you something to cry about.
You better stop fooling around with it
and eat it or you'll be sorry.
Can I please have some more?
Meatloaf, double beetloaf.
I hate meatloaf.
All right. I'll get that kid to eat.
Where's my screwdriver
and plumber's helper?
I'll open up his mouth and I'll shove it in.
How do the little piggies go?
That's right. Oink, oink.
Now, show me how the piggies eat.
This is your trough.
Show me how the piggies eat.
Be a good boy.
Show Mommy how the piggies eat.
Oh, my.
Mommy's little piggy.
It's here.
Are you Parker?
- All right, sign here.
- Yeah. Well, what is it?
I don't know.
What's in it?
Here. Bring it in.
Okay, boys. Haul that on in here.
Move your tails.
Bring it right on in. Right here.
Bring it ahead. Straight ahead.
That's right.
Right.
Here, bring it right in, fellas.
That's it. Here we go.
A little more. Little more.
That's it.
Watch the lady.
Thanks a lot, guys.
Merry Christmas.
Get the crowbar and a hammer, Ralphie.
Go on.
'
- That must be Italian.
- I think that says '
Oh, yeah.
Here we go.
They did a job on this, you know?
No, here, Ralph, hold this.
There could be anything in there!
Jesus!
Maybe they forgot.
It's in there. It's gotta be in there.
- Would you look at that?
- What?
Would you look at that?
What is it?
It's a leg!
But what is it?
Well, it's a leg.
You know, like in a statue.
- Statue?
- Yeah, statue!
Yeah, statue!
Ralphie!
Holy smoke, would you
Do you know what this is?
This is a lamp.
Isn't that great? What a great lamp!
I don't know.
Here, hold it. Hold it. Here, go on.
I know just the place for it.
Right in the middle
of our front room window!
Jesus, God.
- Honey?
- No. It's all right.
Let's see
This goes to the radio
and this goes to the
Well, it's just one too many.
Well, let's see.
Look at that! Will you look at that?
Isn't that glorious?
It's indescribably beautiful.
It reminds me of the Fourth of July!
Turn off all the lights.
I wanna see what it looks like
from the street.
- I'll go get the dining room.
- Couldn't we talk this over?
Move it a little bit to the right.
A little that way.
Just a little More to the right.
Yeah. More. That's it. No, stop!
Right there. That's wonderful.
Parker, what is that?
Don't bother me now.
Can't you see I'm busy?
- Yeah, but what is that?
- It's a major award.
A major award?
Shucks, I wouldn't have known that.
It looks like a lamp.
It is a lamp, you nincompoop.
But it's a major award.
I won it.
- Damn, hell, you say you won it?
- Yeah.
Mind power, Sweed, mind power.
You should see what it looks like
from out here!
Yeah, he won that. It's a major award.
Isn't it about time
for somebody's favorite radio program?

Sheer poetry.

Oh, Ralphie, you've made me proud.

Is there something you want, Ralph?
I'm just turning in my theme.
Well, you can take your seat now.
Take your seat.
Come on, you guys.
Get in the car. Get in the car.
If we don't hurry
we're going to miss all the good trees!
Don't want to waste electricity.
'
Come on, Ralphie. Get in the car.
You folks looking for a tree?
We got 300 trees.
This is the Christmas tree emporium
of the entire Midwest.
Now, you ain't gonna find no better tree
than this here tree.
This here tree is built to last.
Ain't no needles coming off this here tree.
Okay. Now here's a tree.
This here is a tree.
- That's a little skimpy in the front.
- Well, you just put it in the corner.
- Haven't you got a big tree?
- Hell, this ain't no tree.
Now here's a tree. This here is a tree.
- Wait'll the dogs see that one.
- Don't you think it's a little large?
Listen, Christmas only comes
once a year. Why not?
- How much?
- I'll knock off $2...
because I can see you're a man
who knows his trees.
This isn't one of those trees
that all the needles falls off, is it?
No, that's them balsams.
You know, Dew Lock just bought
one of those brand new...
green plastic trees.
Darn thing looks like it was made out of...
green pipe cleaners.
This is a very nice tree.
I'll throw in some rope
and tie it to your car for you.
You got a deal.
Deal.
Damn it. Blow out!
Not again.
Four minutes!
Time me.
Ralphie, why don't you
go help your father?
- Really? Can I?
- Yes.
- Watch the traffic, there.
- Okay.
- What are you doing here?
- Mom says I should help.
Okay, sit down here. Squat down.
Yeah, that's it.
Here. Hold this.
No, not that way.
Come on, rat trap, hold it like this.
- How?
- Like this.
I want to put the nuts in it. There we are.
There's four of them. And we got it!
There it is.
That son of a gun.
I'm gonna get that dirty
There we go.
Oh, fudge!
What did you say?
That's what I thought you said.
Get in the car.
Go on.
Everything go all right?
Eight minutes.
- Do you know what your son just said?
- No. What?
I'll tell you what he said. Randy!
Ralphie!
You ready to tell me?
All right. Where did you hear that word?
Schwartz!
I see.
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz? Yes, I'm fine.
Mrs. Schwartz,
do you know what Ralph just said?
No.
He said
Yes, that.
- Do you know where he heard it?
No! He heard it from your son!
Rinse out and go to bed.
Am I glad you finished your homework!
Get right into bed,
and I don't want to see any lights on.
You are being punished,
so no comic book reading!
I'll come in, and if any lights are on
Don't you give me that look!
You're gonna get it!
Why, it's Ralph!
Well, come on in, Ralph.
Where've you been?
Why, he's carrying a cane!
What is it, Ralph? What happened?
Why, he's blind!
Blind? Oh, my God!
Ralph, is it something we did?
What brought you to this lonely state?
Ralph, please tell us no matter
how it hurts. What did we do?
Look, I can't.
Please, Ralph. I must know what we did.
What brought you to this?
Soap poisoning.
Oh, how could we do it?
I'll manage to get along, somehow.
- I'll never forgive myself.
- Thanks, Mom.
I told you not to use Lifebuoy.
I feel awful!
Thank you, Heather.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Thank you, Flick.
Merry Christmas, Miss Shields.
I just thought that you'd be getting tired
of the same old stuff.
Well, thank you very much, Ralph.
Merry Christmas.
Happy New Year.
You can take your seat now, Ralph.

A crummy commercial?
Son of a bitch!
Red cabbage?
No, that's for tomorrow night.
You love red cabbage, Ralphie.
You filthy system!
I hate it!
Schmucker! Smelly watt-buster!
What was that? What happened?
What happened?
What broke?
I don't know what happened.
I was watering my plant and...
I broke your lamp.
Don't you touch that!
You were always jealous of this lamp.
Jealous of a plastic leg?
Jealous!
Jealous because I won.
That's ridiculous! Jealous?
Jealous of what?
That is...
the ugliest lamp
I have ever seen in my entire life!

We're out of glue.
You used up all the glue on purpose!

People come to smell it, it squirts them.

- No, your Aunt Tilly.
- Yeah, you. Get over here!

I have your Christmas themes for you.
I'm pleased.
In general, you did very well.
However, I was disappointed
in the margins.

C+!

Would you answer in unison, please?

How'd you like your snowball sandwich?
Maybe you'd like another one!
Listen, jerk.
When I tell you to come, you better come!
What? Are you going to cry now?
Come on, cry baby, cry for me. Come on.
Cry!
I'm telling my dad!
Hey, Ralphie!
Beat him up! Beat him up!
Did you hear what he said?
Ralphie!
We're going home. Come on.
Calm down. Come on in here, Ralph.
Put your head down in here.
Come on, get down in here.
Settle down.
I want you to go in there
and lie down in your room for a while.
Ralphie, just settle down.
Here, dry off.
All right, calm down.
All right. Now go lie down.
What's the matter? What you crying for?
Daddy's going to kill Ralphie.
No, he's not.
Yes, he is, too.
No, he's not.
I promise you
Daddy is not going to kill Ralphie.
Why don't you come on out of there?
Would you like some milk?
You would?
Here you go.
All right?
I'll see you later? Okay. Bye.

Go on home, you mangy mutts.
Get out of here, you rotten, filthy
Hey, Bumpus!
Get over here and get your stinking dogs!
Hey, come on, what's for dinner?
I'm starving to death.
Well, what happened today?
Where's your glasses?
Did you lose your glasses again?
Ralphie.
Remember, you left these
on the radio again.
Now try not to do that anymore.
So what else happened today?
Nothing much.
Ralphie had a fight.
A fight?
What kind of a fight?
You know how boys are.
I gave him a talking to.
I see that the Bears
are playing Green Bay on Sunday.
Oh, yeah.
Zudock's got tickets. I wish I had.
He'll freeze his keister off out there.
The Chicago Bears.
The terror of the midway.
More like the Chicago Chipmunks, maybe.
But Bears, never.
Santa!
Yeah, I'll ask Santa.
Mickey!
The store's going to close soon
and Santa will be gone.
Ralphie, Santa's not going anyplace.
Just be still!
Mom, this is just
the same old dumb parade as last year.
- Ralphie, will you please calm down.
- Mom...
- Hush!
- Shut up, Ralphie!
There he is!
Santa!
Have you been a good boy? Have you?
- Can we go now? Can we go?
- Yes, we can go now.
Come on, Ralphie.
Merry Christmas!
Come on, Randy, hurry up.
Ralphie, look over there.
See, the line's not so long. Get in it.
Take Randy's hand and hold on to him.
We'll see you later, okay?
Stay together, you hear?
And don't get lost.
Come on.
Let's go.
Young man.
Hey, kid.
- Just where do you think you're going?
- We're going up to see Santa.
The line ends here. It begins there.
Merry Christmas!
Come on, come up, boys and girls.
Hurry up.
Come on.
I like Santa.
The chocolate snowman eats little boys.
My pretty
What a tasty little boy.
Don't bother me. I'm thinking.
I like
I like the Tin Man.
If Higbee thinks I'm working one minute
past 9:00, he can kiss my foot.
Come on up on Santa's lap.
There's a wet one.
And what's your name, little boy?
Billy.
Come on, Randy.
And what do you want for Christmas,
Billy? A toy truck?
Get him off my lap.
Quick, get me a towel.
I hate the smell of tapioca.
Santa can't wait all night.
Come on up on Santa's lap.
Get moving, kid.
Quit dragging your feet.
Get him out of here.
Come on, kid.
Come on up.
And what's your name, little boy?
Hey, kid, hurry up, the store's closing!
Listen, little boy, we got
a lot of people waiting here, so get going!
What do you want for Christmas,
little boy?
How about a nice football?
Football.
Okay, get him out of here.
I want an official Red Ryder
carbine-action 200-shot...
range model air rifle.
You'll shoot your eye out, kid.
Merry Christmas.
I'll see you in Oz, folks.
Well, did you see Santa Claus?
Did you tell him
what you wanted for Christmas?
Did he ask you if you'd been
a good boy all year?
No.
Don't worry, he knows.
He always knows.
Merry Christmas.
Okay, down you go.
Bye, Chris.
That's fine.
Now wait a minute. All right. Plug her in!
Well, the green string is out.
No, the green is on. It's the blue that's out.
Oh, don't tell me what color it is.
I'm not color blind.
I'm not color blind, either.
There, see, I told you it was green.
Hold it! Don't anybody move!
Hold it right there!
A fuse is out.
Oh, Ralph.
My, isn't that pretty?
That son of a gun.
Yeah. No.
That star is crooked.
That star is perfectly straight.
- Oh, you've got to be careful.
- I am.
It's just Let me get it fixed.
That's all right.
Perfect.
Oh, goodness, look at the time.
I hope Santa hasn't had to pass up
this house...
just because some boys
weren't in bed when he came by.
I thought I heard Santa's sleigh bells...
a little while ago,
going up the other side of the street.
All right, you two, upstairs.
Go on the double, on the double.
Okay, let's get them.
Randy, come on! Get up, Randy!
Wow! A truck! That's mine!
Wow, look over here! That's mine!
What's in here?
It's hard.
Fire truck. Oh boy, that's mine!
Does this raise?
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, you two.
Randy, no.
Wait for Christmas to start, honey.
- I want to play Santa!
- Well, wait a minute, Randy.
He played Santa last year, didn't he?
Ralphie, you play Santa this time.
- Come on, Ralphie.
- Who should I start with?
Well, give Randy a present.
And, I think I see Aunt Clara's gift to you
right over there.
She always sends you
such wonderful presents.
Give me mine, Ralphie! Come on.
Didn't I get a tie this year?
- A zeppelin!
- A can of Simonize.
Ralphie, what did Aunt Clara give you?
Show everybody.
I don't want to.
Ralphie, show everybody
what Aunt Clara gave you.
She just always gives you
the nicest things, Ralphie.
Oh, isn't that sweet?
- Ralph, go upstairs and try it on you...
- I don't want to!
Go upstairs right now
and try on that present!
She went to all that trouble to make it!
Now go on.
While Ralphie is changing,
I'm going to play Santa Claus.
Now, let me see what can I find.
I see something! Randy.
This is for you, honey.
And this is for Daddy.
Here.
From me to you.
Thanks a lot.
I wonder what it could be?
Only one way to find out, isn't there?
Well, it's a blue ball!
It's a bowling ball.
Thank you, darling.
- Do you like it?
- Yes, very much. Very much.
Ralphie.
We're waiting.
Oh, come on, Mom.
Right now!
Come down here so I can see you better.
Isn't that cute?
That is the most precious thing
I've ever seen in my life.
Shut up, Randy.
He looks like a deranged Easter bunny.
- He does not!
- He does, too.
He looks like a pink nightmare.
Are you happy wearing that?
Do you want to take it off?
You tell the kid to take it off.
You'll only wear it when Aunt Clara visits.
Go on and take it off.
Take it off!
My God, will you look at that mess?
- Who's going to clean the papers up?
- Not me.
- Randy did it last year.
- Well, he can do it again.
You know, this wine is not bad.
It's not good either, but
- You want a sip?
- No, you don't.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
Yeah, pretty nice.
Did you get everything you wanted?
- Well, almost.
- Almost?
Well, that's life.
Well, there's always next Christmas.
That's funny.
What's that over there behind the desk?
Where?
Behind the desk,
against the wall over there.
Why don't you go check it out?
What did we put over there, honey?
Santa Claus probably put it.
Do you know how to load it?
That's right.
Be careful.
Don't. They run all over.
Close her up. Close it up.
Can I try it out, Ma? Can I?
- Sure.
- Okay.
But outside.
I still say those things are dangerous.
Put on your galoshes and your coat.
It's cold out.
I had one when I was eight years old.
What if he hurts himself?
Ralphie, your coat!
- Don't shoot any animals or birds!
- Except the Bumpuses' dogs!
Be careful, Ralphie!
Okay, Black Bart, now you get yours.
Ralphie, you be careful out there.
Don't shoot your eye out!
Stop!
Oh, no!
What's the matter, honey?
What happened?
What happened? Let me see that.
There was this icicle
and it fell off the garage and it hit me.
- What is it?
- No, it's okay. Just read your funnies.
