Ah, look at you,
Cleveland!
Put your hands together for this one.
What say?
LEX:
From the top!
Yeah!
LEX:
Thank you.
We love you, Cleveland! Whoo!
- Dudes! Yeah!
- Yeah!
FISH: Do you have any idea how
rare that is? That kind of energy...
...coming off the crowd
and feeding us?
And us feeding it right back to them?
That is what it's all about, my brothers.
We are gonna be huge!
- More importantly, how were my moves?
- Those moves.
I got the best seat in the house
between the guitar and bass...
...and you rocked. Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Oh, now, that was classic Vesuvius.
- Billy.
Nice show. Whoo!
- Hey, what did the label say?
- Let's start with some beers first.
Those are on me,
and those are imported.
- Imported. Sounds like good news, right?
BILLY: Or bad.
FISH: Be right back.
- More like awesome news.
Matchbook Records just offered us
an awesome contract...
...and it is awesome.
- We're gonna be rich!
- I'm gonna get a Fiero.
I'm so happy. I'm so happy.
There's just one hitch.
They want you to replace Fish.
President of the label
wants his nephew in the band.
Fish is the heart and soul of this band.
We've been together since high school.
- He came up with the name Vesuvius.
- Yeah, he's great.
Guys, they're gonna put money
behind you. That means videos, touring...
No. Forget it, Billy.
We're not gonna sell him out
because some rich kid...
...wants to play rock star. Forget it.
- All right.
I'm calling the head of the label now.
Tell him where he can stick his nephew.
Oh, there was talk of you guys
opening for Whitesnake...
...but sometimes opportunity
knocks twice, right?
- Whitesnake, man.
- Dude, I love that band.
I mean, think about it.
Fish will land on his feet, right?
Like I said, he's a great drummer.
KERR:
Right. He's gonna be fine.
Billy, hang up that phone.
You traitors!
Start the van, man. He's coming!
We lost him.
- I don't think that went too well.
- What a baby.
- We did it, guys. All right.
- We totally did it.
- That was kind of awesome!
- It's gonna be all right.
I think we lost him.
That's definitely gonna be in a book
about us.
KERR:
He didn't fit.
After all we've been through?
And you sell me out just like that?
Oh, my God.
He was like a jet plane.
- So fast.
- Fast runner.
- Definitely a fast runner.
- I didn't know how fast he was!
I was going 60.
- He ran like a gazelle, right?
- I was gonna say that.
- Like, his stride was really big.
- Yeah, really big.
Like he'd lived with animals
or something, in the woods.
And he, like, mimicked their... Aah!
LEX:
Jesus, man, keep going!
Oh, my...
We gotta shake him loose, man!
I will drag you down to hell with me.
I will eat your souls.
Hit the brakes, man!
Oh, my God, Kerr. You killed him.
You killed him.
He deserved it, man.
He's dead.
He can't be killed.
Dude, he can't be killed.
He can't be killed.
Back it up, back it up.
He's a zombie!
FISH:
I don't need you!
I'm gonna be 10 times bigger
than you! No!
A billion times bigger than you! No!
Eleventy billion, trillion...
AZIZ: Jeez, this would be a great album
if I could ever listen to it.
New Vesuvius, fellas.
Waited in line two hours last night
to get it. Supposed to be amazing.
Everybody thought they peaked
when their sixth album went platinum...
...but then they came back...
...and blew the doors off
with
rocks.
AZIZ: Look at those faces.
It's the etchings of time, man.
These guys have really lived, you know?
Yeah, I know.
Oh, you a fan?
I mean, how could you not be, right?
I don't really listen
to heavy-metal music.
- Oh, dude, you gotta hear this.
- No, I don't.
- No, seriously, if you've never heard...
- Seriously, I'm not interested.
Trust me. One track,
you're gonna be hooked for life.
- Zammit's Metal Racking.
- Hello, Zammit's Metal Racking. What?
You wanna hear the new Vesuvius?
Yeah. It's sweet, huh?
I'll burn you a copy.
Can you hold, please?
WOMAN:
Well, as it happens, by coincidence,
it was the new album...
...by Vesuvius.
- Damn it, Rob.
- Which is terrible, by the way.
- Totally overproduced.
- Really? Okay, look. Rob.
I know that we've been through this
a whole bunch...
...and I know you think
you're getting past it...
...but this is not getting past it.
It has been 20 years. Let it go.
I have let it go...
...and the universe keeps shoving
Vesuvius back in my face.
Look, guppy, I don't think
I can do this anymore.
This just isn't working for me.
I'm sorry. I think it's time...
- I break up with you.
- What?
- I break up with you. l...
- No.
- No!
- Yes.
- What?
- What were you gonna say?
- I interrupted you.
- You just said what I was gonna say.
I am breaking up with you,
so quiet.
I am fantastic.
You don't break up with me.
I'm gonna have to ask you
to pack your things and leave.
This is my apartment.
FISH:
A fresh start, you know,
get my life back on track.
LISA: That's the attitude, Robert.
- Thanks, sis.
So you'll be on your feet...
...and out of this house
in what, about a week?
- Lisa, come on. Give the guy a break.
- Thank you, Stan.
Talk about your missed opportunity.
Imagine if he was still in Vesuvius.
My brother-in-law in Vesuvius.
Know what our lives would be like?
I'd be wearing silk underwear
right now.
It's like winning the lottery...
...and having the lottery ticket
ripped up in front of your face.
Thank you, Stan.
Thought we weren't supposed to use
the V-word in front of Uncle Rob.
He can take it.
So have you heard? Matt got into MIT.
- Oh.
STAN: That's my boy.
That makes sense. Last time I saw you,
you were building a robot.
How'd that ever work out?
That was eight years ago,
when I was 10.
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Ha!
Maybe you want to take a can
of shut up.
Matt is also in a band,
playing the prom.
- The only way he'd ever get to go.
STAN: Hey.
I swear if you don't stop annoying me,
I'm gonna shave your head in your sleep.
I'd still be the pretty child.
STAN: Matt.
- Violet, Matt, stop it.
A band, huh?
So, what do you call yourselves?
MATT:
A.D.D.
Add? Huh.
- Well, it's short.
- What?
Easy to remember.
No. It's A.D.D.,
as in attention deficit disorder.
Oh, good, you changed it,
because "Add" really blew.
Robby, you know I love you...
...but letting you stay here
isn't gonna solve your problems.
Of course.
Just ditch me, like everyone else has.
It's called tough love, kid.
But what about the sweet love,
where you say, " Hey...
...stay as long as you want, and here's
some cash so you can fix your car."
- In your dreams, pal.
- Sis, come on.
I'm feeling really good about
the future, you know?
Like all of this is... Ah!
Robert?
Where is Jeremy? I swear,
I am gonna kill him when he shows up.
Here he comes, with his mom.
Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jeremy's Mom.
Hey, guys. So I kind of got suspended
from school today...
...and I can't play prom.
- Wait. What?
- Tell them what you did, Jeremy.
I kind of brought hash brownies
to the Spanish Club luncheon.
- Not
MOTHER: And?
And Señorita Horowitz
kind of got really stoned...
...and passed out
in the locker room.
MOTHER:
And?
And somebody kind of drew a, uh...
A penis.
A penis on a grown woman's face.
And now he can't walk
during graduation.
Every mother's dream.
Let's go, Jeremy.
See you guys. Rock hard.
MOTHER:
A penis.
- Prom is in two days.
- Not for us, it's not.
You know what?
Blessing in disguise.
Who wants to play
some crappy school dance anyway?
I do. And so do you.
- Whatever.
- I could ask my uncle.
- I don't think we're that desperate.
- He was an original member of Vesuvius.
- I bet he can still play.
- Yeah, but he's ancient.
Let's start looking for a new drummer.
Yeah, so am I in?
- Hey, wh...
- Sorry, Uncle Rob. Were we too loud?
"Too loud" is not in my vocabulary.
How dare you?
- Excuse me?
- How dare you call yourself a musician?
Loads of bands use drum loops.
Loads of elevators play Celine Dion.
That don't make it right.
Now get your devil box out of here.
Move it, Moby Dick.
Go.
My work here is done.
- That's your uncle.
- That's my uncle.
We've kind of exhausted
all our other options, so...
- I don't have any better ideas.
- Okay, fine. Go talk to him.
Hey, Uncle Rob, can I talk to you?
I will not buy beer for you
and your friends...
...nor rent you my password
to porn sites.
Rent...? No, no. I was...
I was actually just wondering
if you'd play with us at our prom gig.
What did you just say?
I was wondering if you'd play the drums
with us, just for one night.
Absolutely not.
I haven't played the drums in 20 years.
Drumming is pain...
...and I've had more than enough pain
for one lifetime.
Look.
Come... Just meet me up here.
We need a drummer, okay?
And you play the drums.
You've been a pretty terrible uncle
over the years.
Yeah, you only come by when you
need something from my mom.
You never remember my birthday.
You called me Max until I was 11.
Okay, what's your point, Matt?
This is...
This is really, really important to me.
I'm not what you would call
a social butterfly.
You know?
Playing this gig...
...is probably the closest I'm ever
gonna get to...
...breaking the ice with, you know,
the ladies.
You're looking to score.
I can respect that.
Anyway, if you really are my uncle...
...my family...
...you will do this one thing for me.
- Matt, where is he?
- He said he would be here.
He doesn't know the songs,
and I thought he'd be here early.
He said he didn't need to,
he could play with us in his sleep.
He said he feeds on God juice
and miracles spring forth.
Never fear,  Got our laminates.
All access. Drives the chicks wild.
Hey, are you ready?
We're on in five minutes.
Five minutes? What? We're headlining.
We shouldn't go on till 11.
It's the prom. It's over at 11.
Wait. So we're on in five minutes?
Seriously, five minutes?
Okay.
Wow. That's... Five minutes.
Eye of the tiger.
Bang a gong, get it on. Bang a gong.
Get it on, all night long, bang a gong,
get it on. Rock me, Amadeus.
AMELIA:
Oh!
- I'm gonna be so sick.
- A little pre-show ritual.
- Did you just...?
- Lucky charm.
Some people carry a rabbit's foot,
I rock a pocket of puke.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, A.D.D.
Follow my lead.
One, two, three.
PRINCIPAL:
A.D. D, ladies and gentlemen. A.D.D.
Now it's time for your prom king
and queen's first dance.
Stop. Stop.
Woo-hoo! Rock and roll.
Thank you, Cleveland!
Yeah! What a show! Come on.
Mattie, chest bump.
Here we go.
How awesomely sweet was that?
Oh, yeah, if by awesomely sweet,
you mean a horrific train wreck...
...we will never live down, then, yeah,
it was super awesomely sweet.
It was like that scene in
You know, the one where they all die.
What? We rocked
the balls off that place!
- You are delusional.
- You got that right, sourpuss.
You know what else? A.D.D. just landed
itself a new bricklaying drummer...
...and his name is Fish.
Dude. Wake up.
You just ruined that show and you're
never playing with this band again.
Thanks.
FISH: Hello.
KIM: Hello.
FISH: Is Curtis at home?
- Who is asking?
Robert. Fishman.
- My friends call me Fish.
- Fish.
I'm the drummer in the band
from the...
From the prom.
Oh.
Oh, you're serious. Oh, wow.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Curtis said that the drummer was older.
I just... I figured college.
- So and you're his older sister?
- That's very flattering. No, I'm his mom.
No, you're not. Seriously, you're not.
What is your name?
Well, usually, Curtis's little friends
call me Ms. Powell.
- Ms. Powell?
- Mm-hm.
There's the cutest little jazz club...
You know, I'm sorry.
I just don't date my son's friends.
You know? It's just icky.
- Right. Yeah.
- Kids are in the back.
Uh, Curtis? Honey?
Your play date's here.
So sweetie, what time is your mom
picking you up?
You're hysterical.
You have no idea. I'll see you guys.
If it isn't the one-man band.
Okay.
Look.
I haven't played in front
of an audience in 20 years...
...and so maybe, possibly...
...I got a little carried away
and out of control, and I'm sorry.
But I can make it up to you.
What if I told you...
...I could get us a gig?
- I'd say you're full of shit.
Oh, whoa. Curtis, 1991 called.
They want their teenage angst back.
Oh, my God, they just called again.
They want that joke back.
Hang on. A gig?
Like when U2 plays and everybody's like:
"Yeah, U2! I love you."
Yes. These songs need
to be heard, man. Seriously!
Who writes these songs, anyway?
- I do.
- Abandonment issues.
Daddy bailed when he was 4, so...
Well, there's a crazy mojo working
with Mr. Dark and Broody there...
...and me likey.
So what do you say
we lay down tracks...
...with Uncle Fish at the kit,
and let me run with it?
- All right, band meeting.
- Okay. Huddle up.
No, just us three. The band.
Yeah. I'll be in my office.
Okay, perhaps last night
he was a bit ostentatious...
...with his performance style, but you
can't deny the fact that he's got chops.
- No way, man. I told him he's out.
MATT: You can't deny it.
All right, you guys.
Let's just think about it like this.
It might be kind of cool...
...you know, if he were in the band.
We'd have it all:
The magnetic
but tormented lead singer...
...the awkward, neurotic, super-nerd...
- That's me. That's me.
...the kind of ironic, postmodern
you know, punk girl...
...and the ancient
crazy-faces-making rocker.
You can't tell me
you've seen anything like that.
- For good reason. This isn't a joke to me.
- You think it is to us?
What have we got to lose?
All right. If he delivers a gig,
I'll give him a chance.
Woo-hoo! Yes.
Hello, Concrete Jungle?
Galardy's Bar & Grill.
Oh, hi. Is this the Hi-Fi Club?
I played there in 1985 with Vesuvius.
I am with the band A.D.D.
I have a demo.
I have a new band.
It's called A... Hello?
We have not yet rocked Akron.
Yes, do you have auditions?
Thank you.
Thank you. You're closed?
Okay. I'll try back.
Oh, what are you doing here?
I'm working on a song.
Oh, uh-oh. Look out, everybody.
Genius at work.
Lennon and McCartney
rolled into one.
- I'd like to get back to work.
- How many songs in that book?
Probably 211.
Wow.
That's like 500 albums.
I was never so much of a songwriter.
More of a name-the-band kind of guy.
Different skill set. Still important.
Can I look at what you are writing?
Dude, we are a band, okay?
Bands share everything.
- Deodorant. Buses. Chicks.
- I'd just rather not.
- We're like a family.
- No.
I'll be gentle.
Okay.
- These are some great lyrics.
- Thank you.
"Tomorrow never comes."
So true. I don't understand it,
but that's heavy, man.
- Thanks.
- That's good stuff.
Thank you.
So your dad took off
when you were just a little kid?
Mm. That must have been tough.
You miss what you never knew.
- What are you doing?
- That's good.
- "You miss what you never knew."
- It is? You like it?
- Yeah.
- And you can have it, gratis.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Are you gonna finish that?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- So any luck getting us a gig?
- Yeah.
It's just about finding
the right showcase.
It's just focusing
on the perfect showcase.
No one likes the demo.
I mean, it's stupid to think anybody
but me would be into it.
What? This music is great,
and I can prove it.
- How?
- Let's ride.
This, my friend,
is called the drive test.
If we can drive around
with no place to go...
...blast the music, and feel like we're
on top of the world...
...then we know
we're onto something.
Sing it.
Like you mean it!
Come on.
FISH:
Right?
How do you come up with
those rhymes? "Busted, trusted."
I don't know how you come up with it.
I like this part.
Isn't it something, Cleveland?
A.D. D!
- This guy!
- And this guy!
- Mosh pit!
- Mosh?
Slam dance!
It does make you feel invincible, huh?
Like everything is possible now!
And you know what?
If we can bring that to an audience,
even for four and a half minutes...
...then we've got something.
Give me your phone.
Make it turn into a camera.
- That? Okay.
- Yeah.
Give me a rebel yell on three.
Three, two, one!
That is the moment we knew
we were gonna be huge.
Whoo!
Hello?
Yeah, hold on a sec. Robert!
ROBERT: Ow!
- Robert!
ROBERT:
I'm busy.
- Phone!
ROBERT: Jeez.
Now.
I think it's about a job.
How could it not be about a job?
One of those ones I've been
looking so hard for.
Hello, this is Fish. What?
What? Yeah! No, hold on.
Hold on.
Yeah.
- Gone... That's what I did.
- Yeah, but you sing the harmony.
FISH:
Oh, jeez.
That needs to be fixed.
AMELIA: God.
FISH: I have news...
...but you know what?
Before I reveal said news...
...we need to work on some things,
including stage presence.
Why? Because A.D.D. has a gig.
- What?
- A gig?
FISH:
A gig! Yes!
- Whoo!
- Yes!
We are playing the Tiger Room
in Fort Wayne, Indiana...
...Saturday night. We are hitting
the "muh-huh-fuh-ing" road.
Oh, Indiana.
My mom's not gonna let me
go to Indiana.
- No, my mom's not gonna let me go.
FISH: Listen up, kiddies.
You don't ask your parents
for permission to rock.
You think The Beatles went to
their mums and dads:
"Hello, Mum. Hello, Dad.
May I have permission to go
with my mates...
...to a little pub
called Shea Stadium...
...and rock the world
for the rest of eternity?" No!
They were adults! You're an ad...
They were adults.
- What about the church-retreat excuse?
- What's that?
It's like, " Mom, Dad, I really wanna go
on this church retreat...
...that I heard about so that I can learn
about the Bible...
...you know, and meet other teenagers
who share my interest in the Bible."
- Ha. This works?
AMELIA: Yeah.
You just print up a fake flyer
on Photoshop...
...show it to your parents,
and you're at a show.
Give it up
right now, daughter of Beelzebub.
Hit me.
Nothing. Nothing.
You're a tough cookie...
...but I'm gonna get a smile
out of you yet.
Smiling is for the weak.
MATT : I can't believe
we're stealing my mom's car.
FISH :
It's not stealing when you're family.
But still, don't tell your mom.
Hop in.
I'm so nervous.
- Did you just sneeze on my face?
- No, that wasn't me.
FISH:
What you working on?
You going to ask to hear something
every time you see me writing?
Pretty much, yep.
- It's called "Bitter."
- Butter?
"Bitter."
It's a song?
- Yeah, it's a song.
- Let's hear some.
It goes:
And it goes on like that.
Well, the cyanide and razor blades
are in the glove box. Help yourself.
- Come on. Hey. Hey. Hey.
- What?
It's really good stuff. It's like poetry.
I just wanna say, I am so excited
we're on the road.
We are doing it.
We're living our dream.
This is it. This is what it's about,
living our dream.
You know, we don't stop.
We don't stop for anything. We just...
I'd better stop.
LISA:
Come on, Robert. Let's go.
I can't believe you called
the cops on me.
- You stole my car, Robert.
- I topped off your fluids.
Oh, get a job!
I had a job, an awesome gig
that was gonna pay $ 100...
...until you reported your car missing.
- Oh, take responsibility!
You!
- So long, Mattie.
- So long...
Don't talk!
You are not allowed to speak!
You are not allowed to drive...
In fact, to do anything
for the rest of the summer.
You can take away the wheels
and his right to free speech...
...but you cannot take away
the dream.
Damn right.
Shut up, Stan.
Get out of my house, Robert.
Hey, Fish, Fish, Fish. Listen.
I'm really sorry she made me drop
a dime on you.
It's okay, buddy.
Hey, give me the heavy-metal
devil horns.
Now lock them with me.
My brother.
FISH: Oh, man, thanks for letting me
stay here, Mr. Lee.
I really appreciate it.
Yeah, those rice bags look comfortable.
Fish, no one has eaten
more takeout than you.
You put my kids through college.
You stay until you get
back on your feet, huh?
Thanks, Mr. Lee.
Wow. That heat is tremendous.
Take this.
- What's this for?
- For the rats.
Rats?
MATT:
Uncle Rob?
Hey. Hey, I thought
you were grounded.
Technically, I'm at the library
for the next 10 minutes.
But I'm not, really. I'm here.
Phew.
It's uncomfortably hot down here.
So, what brings you
to the House of Lee?
I have a way...
...we can still practice.
Mike check. Check. Can you hear me?
- Oh!
MATT:
FISH:
FISH:
- Oh, God. Okay.
FISH:
No. Yeah. I know, I keep trying to
download the homework...
...but my annoying brother
is hogging all the bandwidth.
Some stupid practice in our garage.
Hang on. I'll call you back.
Hello, YouTube.
Oh, dude, this is that thing
they were talking about on Stern.
Holy shit. I think that's Robert.
FISH:
BARNEY: Oh, that's a lot of Robert.
Leon, come here, come here.
That's... This guy's hilarious.
That's my brother-in-law.
- The song's pretty g...
STAN: Just had dinner with him.
LEON: Get out of here.
Ahem. You want to share this
with the rest of the class, huh?
Oh. What is that?
FISH:
-
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, God. Okay.
BOY: I'm telling you,
that's the naked drummer.
Are you sure, man? It's kind of
hard to tell with his clothes on.
It is the naked drummer.
Hey, fam.
I got here as fast as I could.
There he is. I don't recognize you
with clothes on.
David Marshall, head of A and R
for Matchbook Records.
Matchbook Records?
By the way, I'm Stan.
I'm kind of with the band.
Great, great.
He's come all the way from Los Angeles
to meet you, Robert.
We're on the Internet. On the Internet.
DAVID:
Over a million hits and counting.
- You know what that sound is? Anybody?
- No.
DAVID:
What about you, Norm from
That's the sound of the money truck
backing up to your door.
But my team at Matchbook,
we see more than money.
We see beyond the gimmick
of the naked drummer.
It's a fun video.
We're laughing at it, laughing...
...but then we're humming the songs.
It's the rope-a-dope.
Know what I mean? The rope-a-dope.
We're laughing, laughing, then boom!
Out of nowhere, we're singing
and humming the tunes. Why?
Why would we do that? I'll tell you why.
Because the songs kick F-ing ass.
Wow! All these years,
wearing a suit to the office.
- I should have been a naked drummer!
- Absolutely. Here's the dealio.
If A.D.D. has more tunes like that,
then Matchbook is very interested.
I'm sure you guys got a lot of heat.
Lot of people coming after you.
Yeah, I didn't pay taxes in the '90s.
The phone's been ringing
off the hook with offers.
Good. Good to know. Okay.
We're in the pressure cooker.
We are through
the looking glass, amigos.
I'm gonna call my people, I'm gonna
come back and holler at you.
Excuse me a sec.
We're gonna be signed.
We're gonna be signed.
- Well...
- I'm gonna go call Amelia and Curtis.
WOMAN: I love your new tat.
MAN: I just got it done.
WOMAN:
I'll validate you on your way out.
MAN:
All right, thanks.
Hello. I'm here for A.D.D.
Name?
Robert Fishman.
Studio 3.
Wait. My name is on the list?
- Yeah.
- So my name is on that list.
Yeah.
Can I have it?
- No.
- Okay. Sure.
AMELIA: This does not suck.
CURTIS: You're the man.
They have free food.
Whoa.
The mixing board...
...with its thousands
of mysterious buttons.
The big chair...
...that swooshes me
around the studio.
That allows me to slide
wherever I care to go.
The soundproof glass window.
The giant headphones.
FISH: It's not very good.
It's very, very depressing.
It makes me wanna kill myself.
Seriously, we need to stop this
right now.
Why don't we turn this frown
upside down?
Let's just push the tempo.
Say, "I'm not bitter."
- Okay.
- Okay? Follow my lead.
- What's he doing?
FISH: From the bridge. Let's do it.
One, two, three, four!
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Sing!
- You recording?
- Yep.
- Yeah!
- Ow!
- Yes. That's what I'm talking about!
CURTIS: That rocks.
Instead of a canoe paddling in a pond,
we were a tank flying down a mountain.
- I like that. It feels really good.
- What do you guys think?
Lennon's rolling over in his grave
to hide the boner you just gave him.
We're gonna bounce that down.
- Yeah! Bouncing it down!
- Whoo! What does that mean?
I have no idea. Let's take five.
Someday one of these bad boys
will have your name on it, C-note.
I guarantee.
There's a lot of biz buzz on you
back in Hollyweird, my man.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You got an opportunity to capitalize
on this YouTube thing.
We're talking an album, a tour...
You're gonna have more ladies
than Jay-Z got Mercedes.
You're gonna need two dicks.
- Thanks.
- Yeah, yeah. No problem.
- What are you guys doing?
- Just telling Big C here the game plan.
We're gonna hang out in the studio
a couple weeks, do more recording...
...then strap in, young'uns.
We're hitting the road.
- What?
- You heard me, Curly Sue.
Midwest tour.
Huh? That's right!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
DAVID: All right. Easy.
- Yeah.
FISH: And in conclusion,
ladies and gentlemen...
...I promise you that on the road,
these kids will have an experience...
...unlike any they have
ever experienced!
KIM:
Um...
I think, well,
what he's trying to say in a...
Just a really incomprehensible way...
...is that this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity for them.
And they have worked so hard,
and want this so badly.
And I'm not thrilled with letting Curtis go
without me being there...
...but I don't want him to spend the rest
of his life thinking, "What if...?"
You know? So you got my vote.
I'm sorry.
I lived my life saying, "What if...?"
Twenty years of "What if...?"
You feel me, Jack?
You'll be safe, right?
Of course.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Lisa?
Okay. All right.
MOM: Just please be careful.
AMELIA: Okay.
Hey. Thank you.
You're welcome.
But if one hair on his head is harmed,
I will kill you.
- Cool.
- All right.
- Mattie? I trust you.
MATT: Yeah?
But I don't trust your uncle.
So I don't want you to listen
to a word he says, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Whoa.
FISH:
First tour bus.
Nice ride.
MATT: I'll call you guys.
- Please do.
- Will you be okay?
- Yes. I'm gonna be fine.
- I love you. I'm so proud of you.
- Love you too.
Mr. Gator here.
All you bear bait headed north...
...on big slab l-5 round yardstick 40...
- Citizens band, huh?
Pretty cool.
- Ever heard of cell phones?
- Ever heard of brain cancer?
There's two things in this world
I do not trust when they're wireless...
...and that is phones and marionettes.
FISH:
Woo-hoo! Beaded curtains.
Fridge with beer. Beer I didn't pay for.
Yes. Time to party hearty. Hello.
I thought you were
gonna be the responsible adult.
Oh, I'm gonna be
responsible, all right...
...for partying till my nuts catch fire.
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with me? All my life,
people kept saying, " Grow up.
Give up your dreams. Get a haircut, Fish.
You'll never rock anymore."
Well, you know what?
Look at me now, day job!
Woo-hoo!
On your left,
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
Whoo!
Save some room
for my drums, baby...
...because Fish's Age of Rage
has begu...
I got a bug.
- Woo-hoo! First venue.
CURTIS: All right.
First marquee.
Check, check, check. Check, one, two.
Check, one, two. Check. Check.
- First sound check.
- Yeah.
Check, check. Test hit.
Testes, one, two, testes,
check, check.
HOST: Let's give a warm
Dayton welcome to A.D.
Yeah.
Hi.
Hello.
Hey, hey. Let's rock.
One, two, three.
First technical difficulty.
