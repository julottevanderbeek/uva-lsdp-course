I was speechless at 5 years old.
I was taken there.
Did you get cured?
Do you wanna hear me talk?
But it's in India.
So what..
Its not in the US.
It is easier to go to the US..
Yes we were one nation

I've decided.
I'll take Shahida to Delhi

handed from the God's beloved .

Why has the train stopped?
-Slight delay due to construction madam.
It will be fixed soon.
Don't you worry.
I'll go to sleep then..
Shahida.
What happened?
-I can't find my daughter!
Indians are saying they
couldn't find your daughter
They'll search in the morning.
Sir..
Please listen to me.
Let me go and find
her myself.
But its across the border,
..in a foreign land
So what.
I've to bring back my daughter.
But to go there
you'll need a visa.
Be patient, you'll get your daughter.
-How is that possible?
Don't you understand..
My daughter is mute..
She is alone in a foreign land.
You people are hopeless..
I'll find Shahida by myself.
Trust in the Lord.
Stop crying my child..
Hope she'll be found
by a good person.
..Someone who will take
good care of her.

I'm Pawan..
Pawan Kumar Chatravedi
alias Bajarangi.
You call me brother...
How old are you?
six..
When you start talking..
..you call me uncle..
My father was a postmaster
in Pratapgarh
He was a master in Holy books.
I was just the opposite.
no 25.. no 26
no 27..28...30
For him health was as
important as education.
Good.. lets start.
I even failed in wrestling.
No laughing..
he won't reform
Nothing can be done..
wrestling tickles me..
Wrestling always tickled me..
I was helpless.
The honor he had was not enough for him
he also became a leader..
Studies, wrestling, leadership...
I wasn't interested in any of it
He gave me a special nickname..
What?
Zero.
What?
-I failed.
I took 20 years to complete schooling.
..from school to graduation,
I failed 10 times.
My father had given up on me.
What?
-I failed.
My friends advised me to cheat in exams.
But I am Bajarangbali's disciple..
I said I will fail but never cheat.
So I approached him the 11th time.
Please come.
You must have broken
your own record in failing.
when you completed your schooling...
Why did you have to honor
me anymore by failing 11 times.
I've accepted that
you're foolish.
you're zero..
-But listen to me..
What should I listen? Tell me..
you've failed 10 times.
..and failed me 20 times..
But listen to me..
What is left there to
listen, you tell me...
If you want to do
something for me..
Go away from here..
Delhi.
I heard that there is scarcity of fools.
I've an old friend there
"Dayanand"
He'll get you a job..
I passed the exams.
What did your father tell you?
He might have got shocked.
I knew he'll be in shock,
but didn't know its intensity.
What happened?
Father I'm going to Delhi.
I went to Delhi to fulfill his last wish.
to Dayanad sir.
I don't have change.
Give 5/- from it, to that madam.
Madam he will pay you your 5/-
Greetings.

so that I can give you 10/-
I don't.
Now what?
-Its alright, you keep the money
How can I do that?
Then give it to me.
-How can I?
Look sir, you can keep the money.

Then give it to me.
It also belongs to me!
Sister.

Your money.
I don't want money.
Please take it..
So give me..
You took everything!
Half belongs to me.
Ok..You see that vendor?
Go and get change from him.
Do you have change for 10?
-Yes
You?..
You..

Don't you understand..
You know him?

This stalker followed me home..
No I'm not.
I didn't follow you..
I am from Pratapgarh to meet Dayanand sir.
Who are you..
-I'm Pawan  son Chataravedi.

Is someone cooking meat?
Neighbour next door.

But in my house..
I have strictly decided..
not having tenants of other religions.
What do you do for living?
I'm here to find job.

You too..

Are you also still studying in school?
I don't study.

Go tomorrow with Rasika..
You'll get some job.
Hail Bajaranbali.
Lots of monkeys here..

Take this..
Place it under your bed
before sleep.

One sec.
Give me your hand..
-Excuse me!

Then one day Trivedi
and his son came.
Please come..
Be seated.
How are you  Proshotum?

What will you ask him?
Do you know
what I will ask?
Give me your hand.
Don't you trust me?
Where's Rasika?
She'll come.
I think she is too shy to come..
You always used to say..
..that you see your dad in your bridegroom.
i can't see it in anyone else but Pawan.
Rasika!
Forgive me..
We can't be relatives..
Its my daughter's decision.
You should have told us before..
..instead of insulting us.
Let's go.
Who wants to stay here!
Sir..
You can't be engaged with Rasika.
until you become
capable, for her.
To be capable, my
first condition is house.
which you'll buy
with your earned money
you got only 6 months,
or I'll find someone..
..who is able.
I have not asked you this yet..
What's your age?
Wow Bajarangi bro.
.wow!
Congratulations...
In 2 or 3 months
I'll get new house..
Absolutely..
Bombay......Agra?
How do you know
she's a Brahmin..
..when she can't speak?
she's fair..
..must be Brahmin.
When will she leave?
When we find her parents.
When will that be?
when Bajrangbali wills..
Have you ever
traveled by air?
I did once.
Do you know what
they say in plane?
First wear your oxygen mask,
and then help others.
When will you stop
your social work?
Think about your life also.
Work hard..
Build a house..
If you can't..
..admit it now.
So that you don't waste your time..
..neither Rasika's.
This will fit a 6 year old?
We couldn't find Munni's parents?
Will she live with us

What if not?
Who doesn't have parents?
Orphans.
Who is your favorite player?
Dhoni?
Virat Koli?
Yuvi?
Shekar Dhavan?
Sewag?
Told you all the names!

We found it..
Munni's home.

Why?
Did she loose her tongue?
Let me see.

That was a narrow escape.
Hello.

from Chawla.
That Indian spy
is in the bus.
Which bus?
In this bus..
..he's right in front of me
Hurry up sir.
What bus is it idiot?
Its on Alipur road.
Ticket?
Do you know this place?
Is that a joke?
Where do you
want to go?
She's from Pakistan.
Don't know how
she reached India.
..all alone..
..her parents might
have lost her.
She can't speak.
..but recognizes this place.
I believe she is from
somewhere here.
Are you from India?
Yes.
How?
You know that border..
..that fence.. crawled under it.
..but with permission.
You came a long way from India..
..just to look for her parents?!
Yes.. Why?
That's amazing..
If only we had more like you in
both our countries..
..would have been great.
Show me the picture.
Sir that..
Stop stammering..
They ran away..
What!
Anybody recognize this place?
Have a good look..
Brother..
No.
There!
That should be it.. Hurry.
Over there..
What is it sir?
A man..
..they boarded this
bus with a little girl.
No sir..
there was none like that.
Has anyone of you..
seen a man
and a little girl.
No sir, we haven't seen them.
Sir that Chand Nawab told
me that its this bus.
Sir..
.she was doing this gesture..
showing that her home..
was in one of those pictures.
Where's that photo?
Its with them.
Check all the buses on highway.
Quick!
Either you are
very brave..
..or a big fool.
You entered Pakistan just like that..
no fear?
I was left with no choice.
Ok.. but how will you
find her parents?
Bajarangbali will help..
In Pakistan?
Tonight you'll be safer here.
..but..
..leave early in the morning.
What is this place?
Mosque.
Forgive me Bajarangbali.
What happened fellow?
Are you alright?
You look troubled.
What happened to me.
I'm perfectly alright.
Why stand here?
lets get inside.
Hey..listen..
Why were you absent?
Sorry sir..
Go.. I'll be there soon.
I can't go inside.
Why?
I'm not Mohammedan.
So what brother...
This place is open
for everyone.
..this is why we never
lock our mosque..
Come on..
So that's your problem.
I've never been to these places..
..but yes..
..we have some students who..
.may be from there.
Let me ask them.
Dear students..
Yes sir..
Have a good look
at this picture.
..and tell me where it is.
..and correct answer..
..will win you a price.
..a big one.
Stop!  Stop!
Take it back..
take it back.
He was with Chand Nawab.
You come here.
Sir this is Switzerland.
If you don't know then let others answer.
I'm telling you the truth.
This is Switzerland.
Here its written in English.
Switzerland.
Munni?!
Are you from Switzerland.?
Stop!
You can find such
locations in Kashmir.
Kashmir?
Go back to India?
No Sir..
..we also have a small part.
What?
Kashmir.
Stop there sir.
Please put your guns away.
Have you seen any strangers
Maulana Sahab?
There are no strangers
in God's house.
This stranger is dangerous...
An Indian spy.
Did you think that
he'll come here..
..to steal some
atom bomb formula?
Kindly inform us if you
see any strangers around.
-OK.
Its difficult to escape.
Is there a way?
There's a way.
What else will you make
me do Bajarangbali?
slept in Mosque, wore burqa..
and before
my circumcision..
..I beg you to find
her parents.
What!
He's in Pakistan!
You said..
..he'll leave her at Atari..
How can he go to Pakistan?
Who gave him passport, visa?
He went without that.
He went there without
Passport and Visa?!
You'll ruin your health...
..calm down.
You have no idea what
they will do to him.
One is hard enough..
..but Maulana Sahab has
two of them.
There will be police on road...
..you go through
those fields..
..you'll reach Khanewal.
Thank you.
You doing a
noble task.
I'll pray to Allah that
you find her parents.
How is it that you say?
Jai Sri Ram?
Jai Sri Ram.
-Yes Jai Sri Ram.
Jai Sri Ram.
Let's keep moving.
You are responsible for this.
..neither you had to send
Munni away..
nor Pawan had
to go.
..you are the reason
he's in trouble.
Do something.
What can I do?
If you don't do
anything..
..i'll also go to Pakistan.
What!
O Lord!
Without any visa.
Can't do this anymore.
I can't breath nor walk.
One of us have to
dress like a wife.
Police are looking for
two men and a child.
You do it.
Really.
If someone asks your name..
you'll say..
"My name's Pawan Chatravedi.."
"..I'm from Delhi,
I worship Bajarangbali.."
"..I got permission to crawl
under the border fences."
Am I right Munni?
There are people..
..put down your veil.
..walk like a woman.
Munni..
Do me a favor..
She'll get caught!
This is wrong.
Dishonesty is never rewarded.
Mark my words.
You spoke again woman!
Now shut it.
O this vehicle..
Sir, can I give you a hand?
Sure.
Kindly be seated..
Start it when I tell you.
-OK.
Did you find the fault?
It takes time to
find the illness.
Are you a mechanic
or a doctor?
Try it now.
What did you do?
Try it again.
That's what I did.
Wow you fixed it in a minute.
Its my duty to help travelers.
Thanks a lot.
Shall I drop you someplace?
What's your name dear?
She has been speechless
since birth.
Wonder how her mother feels!
What do doctors say
madam?
She is also speechless.
..same condition.
..its hereditary.
Its all fate.
True.
Are you going to Khanewal?
No.
But don't you worry..
..I'll leave you home..
You don't really have to
do that sir..
Just drop us at highway.
I will ask one of my..
..officers to drive you..
..to your home.
Officers!
what do you mean?
I'm the Superintend
of that area.
I was on leave today..
..going back to work because
of an emergency.
Emergency?
There's an Indian spy
around here..
He won't escape.
Where is Chand Nawab?
I don't know.
You don't!
-Please don't beat anymore
..I swear that I saw him last time..
..entering into bus.
I tried ... calling him.
..phone's switched off.
Now..
..try calling him before me.
..hurry up!
Switched off.
Come with me..
..this is my stop.
..my men will leave you home.
Please come.
Hey Hassan.
-Yes sir.
Come here..
..they are my special guest.
..an amazing mechanic too.
Leave them at their doorstep
at Khanewal.
-Yes sir
Please come.
Thank you sir.
Thank you..
..you did me a big favor.
You may have breakfast here.
No thank you..
..we'll leave.
Let's go.
Please sit.
Careful.
See you.
Call him every hour.
He'll answer sometime.
Where's your house?
A little further.
Are you lost?
I haven't been here for
a long time..
..I eloped with her,
so her father is angry.
This is it.
Here?
-Yes.
Thank God we found your house.
You almost forgot your home..
It happens sometimes.
That's alright.
Get me Waqar.
Yes sir.
Any info about that spy?
His name is Pawan
alias Bajarangi.
He's with a local journalist..
Chand Nawab.
Let me leave you inside.
-Won't be necessary sir.
..thanks a lot for leaving us here.
Bye
-Take care.
Father-in-law..
How are you?
Who are you?
Forgive us..
..there's you daughter
and grand child.
Come here dear.
Who is she?
What's she doing?
I don't have any daughter.
What's the use of getting
angry here..
..lets go inside.
Getting me involved
without any reason.
I know you are angry with me..
But!
-Hit me.
But I...
Sir.. Sir..
Let him go sir..
Sir...sir.
Let's go inside.
Take it easy..
Good bye sir.
-Good bye.
..They also have
a little girl.
Girl?
How old?
Around 5 or 6 years old.
And she can't speak.
Speechless?
Yes sir.
Then why are you still
standing there?!
..Radio the message to Hassan
immediately.
Sir.
Who is that?
Open the door.
Are you gonna
break my door?
Huh!
You!
Where are they?
Who?
Your daughter and
son-in-law.
I've said this many times..
.have no daughter
or son-in-law.
Then where are they who claimed
to be your daughter and son-in-law?
How will I know?
They vanished as soon
as you left.
I was thinking of surrendering
to police.
..then the police will ..
..somehow find..
Munni's parents.
Don't even think about it.
You'll rot in jail and nobody
will know your whereabouts.
And do you think the police
will have your kind of passion?
..They might try for 2 or 3 days
..and then..
..Munni will be sent
to orphanage.
I will never allow this..
I've promised Bajarangbali..
..that I'll find her home.
..I am determined.
There might be a way..
Television.
TV?
Story has no punch.
It has sir..
An Indian..
..the way he helps a speechless
Pakistani child..
..its an awesome story sir.
Your spy's story...
had more punch..
..what happened to that..
..but he's not a spy.
..then there's nothing left.
Bye.
Hello!
Sir but...
What good is that
story to us?
Sir..
..a child will get her parents..
Get her parents!
Bro..
We sell news..alright..
..We are not
Hazrat Amin Shah Dargah.
..who unites separated people.
Bye.
Hate is easy to sell.
..but love..
What is
Hazrat Amin Shah Dargah.?
Its a famous shrine.
It is said that
wishes can come true.
Why didn't we go there yet?
Really..
..you get sick of
mosques and shrines..
Remember that mosque..
..you were running away
as if seen a ghost..
I can go to any shrine
for Munni's sake.
Lets travel tonight.
Its ringing!
Kamil!
I was worried.. thank God..
Where are you?
Is someone near you?
Nobody is around me.
Are you with the spy?
He's not a spy.
He's a noble man.
What do you mean?
He's here to unite the lost girl.
Where are you now?
We are leaving for
Hazrat Amin Shah Dargah.
Its said that it unites
separated people.
Take care of yourself.
I'll see you later..
Where are you going?
I'm Chand Nawab..
Today I am going to tell you about
a man who came here without any visa..
..but entered our land at night by crawling
under the border fences.
..His name is Bajarangi.
Just like the police, I too believed..
that he's a spy..
..but now I know..
..that he's no spy..
..then what is he?
Why is he in our land?
What does he want?
He's a common man just
like you and me..
And he's here because of love.
Compassion for a 6 year old speechless girl.
..who lost her parents in India.
When all the door
were closed...
..he had to take this route
to find her parents.
All the TV channels refused
to air this story..
..calling is bogus and
waste of time.
..and that nobody
will be interested.
So I plead you to help Bajarangi
..find her parents..
..and also for his
safe journey back home.
Ring him.
He's here with the police...
They are near.
He's not answering.
Answer the phone.
What!
Answer the phone.
-Why?
There's a plan.
Hello brother
Chand Nawab!
Is everything alright?
Everything is fine.
Did you go to the shrine?
Yes we went there last night.
Where are you now?
Now?
We are going to Gojra.
You are going to Gojra.
OK..
OK I'll call you later.
Take care.
Wow bro..
You finally lied..
When did I lie?
You made me lie!
So what..
Haven't you watched Mahabharata on TV?
Is it a movie?
Action movie?

child or know anything..

Sir!
Check out this video.
Chand Nawab uploaded
this yesterday.
Its outside the shrine.
They were never at Gojra.
..we've searched everywhere.
..no sign of them.
Listen..
Send pictures to all
the police stations...
..and check every trucks, buses and
other vehicles immediately.
Did you see your village?
Bro!
Listen to me
very carefully.
Come forward.
Show me your face.
Take it off.
He's the one..
I'm Chand Nawab..
Today I am going to tell you about

With cameraman Shah Nawab
this is Chand Nawab.
Kashmir.
I don't care what the media thinks..
For us, he is an
Indian spy.
But sir..
..we've confirmed from her parents..
..that she was lost in India.
Pakistani people has
sympathy for him.
Then..
..tell the media..
..the he has confessed ..
..he's a spy.
..then there won't be..
..any sympathy.
Ask your men to get
information from India.
Yes she couldn't speak.
I remember it well.
He brought her here.
..said she was lost.
Stop it!
Hello.
Sir we have verified
his story from..
..Kurukshetra police station
and Delhi High Commission.
He has taken
that child there..
He is no spy.
Mr. Hamid Khan..
You cannot decide
who's what...
..that's my job.
..your job is to make
him confess..
..that he's a spy.
But sir..
And yes..
..if you can't follow orders..
..then I can send someone
more able..
..and then you'll be
on long leave.
He wants his confession
at any cost.
I've worked all my life
protecting and honoring this country
..but..
..if..
..this man..
..spends all his life behind
bars in Pakistan..
..it will be against our
country's honor.
I'll not let that happen.
Hello.
Who is this?
Hamid sir!
Yes sir?
Yes
Thank you.
That's good sir.
Thanks a lot.
Get the camera..
Sir there's a new video
on the Bajarangi story.
It will go in the bulletin.
Rasika sister!
Look Bajrangi is on TV.
Tody Pakistani reporter
Chand Nawab has..
..posted a new video today
..on Bajarangi Bhaijan.
..who is locked
in Pakistani jail.
Pawan Chatravedi.
aka Bajrangi Bhaijan..
is an Indian who risked his life to
find a Pakistani girl's parents.
Run this story
immediately.
..why did he do this?
...for money?
for fame?
..for riches?
..No.
He did this out of good heart.
..he did this for a Pakistani girl
in the name of love.
..unfortunately..
..he got trapped because of
countries hatred towards each other.
..this hatred has caused Bajangi
to hide in Pakistan.
..Please end this hatred.
..and we have to do this..
..the millions of both the nations.
..who wants to raise their
children in love and not hate.
So lets us all end this
hatred together.
Let us all go to
Narowar check post..
What nonsense!
Seal Narowar check post.
Let billions of people from
both countries make sure..
..nobody stops our Bajarangi Bhaijan from
crossing the border..
..or going back home.
..with cameraman Kamil Yousif
this is Chand Nawab.
Brother Chand.
Munni?
I have fulfilled my promise.
Munni is..
Shahida..
Shahida is with her parents.
Shahida!
Yes.
Hurry up Pawan.
Come back soon.
..not under the fence..
..but with a visa.
I promise.
Please stop.
Open the gate.
Sir we are given
orders to arrest you.
If this man risks his life..
..to find your lost daughter..
..would you still not open the gate?
You know that..
I can't open this gate..
Can you hear them!
..voice of the common people
of Pakistan.
If they can tell the difference
between right and wrong...
..then why can't you?
You're a soldier!
You should know better.
Just following orders
sir.
..to stop him from
crossing our borders.
..but..
..we are few in number..
...and thousands of people present.
Did you get it?
Shahida!
Shahida!
Pawan!
Brother Pawan!
Pawan!
Uncle!
Uncle!
Jai Sri Ram Uncle!
