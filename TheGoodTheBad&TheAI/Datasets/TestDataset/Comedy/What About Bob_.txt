Doctor, It's your wife on the phone
Thank you Claire.
Fay, Are you sitting down ?
My Publisher thinks it's gonna happen
Ya, he thinks Good Morning America is coming to lake
Pinasetoki next week to interview me.
It's a tremendous shock in the arm for my book.
Ye.. No! It's very unsual..
Well I think they did visit doctor Rooth once but, other than that ...
Hold on a second honey.
Yes.
Excuse me doctor, but there is doctor Godswell on the phone.
Thank You.
Fay, I have to go, just another collegue on the phone.
Wow, it's rude to come out to the real work when you're famous
Good bye there.
Godswell !
Leo ! Long time no see huh !
You've got a big book out !
Things are really clikin' huh ?
That's the way I planned it !
Listen Leo, I'm quitting my practice for a while, I'm leaving town.
And I have one patient I'd like to refer to you.
Exactly what kind of case is it Godswell ? He's not psycothic is he ?
No ! No ...nothing like that !
Listen, his name is Bob Willey
He pays early, he comes on time.
He just  needs someone brilliant.
I know you don't like flatery but,
If there's anyone I know who could win a Nobel Prize, it's you.
Well...I suppose I could find an hour for him sometime after labour day
Okay ! I'll work him in for an interview
Hey Godswell , huh , how come you're leaving town ?
We're a dying breed Leo, Good Luck !
Free !
Claire, If a Bob Willey calls, schedule him for a short interview
right after I get back from my vacation
He's already called Dr Marvin, twice, he's your next apointment.
Hmm , That's persistence.
I feel good, I feel great I feel wonderful
I feel good, I feel great I feel wonderful
I feel good, I feel great I feel wonderful
I feel good.
Can I Help you Sir ?
Yes, Dr Marvin, Dr Leo Marvin
Second Elevator, 44th Floor.
Thank You.
Elevator ?
Bob..Willey...
Hum, Why don't you sit down, it will be a few minutes.
Dr Marvin, Bob Willey.
Thank You.
Thank you for working me Doctor.
Should I call you Dr Marvin or Leo ?
Which ever you like.
Call me Bob.
Is that your family ?
Yes.
Oh wait, let me guess, I'm very good at this!
Err, That's Harriet...
And then Ronny
Gretchen
And Rita.
Eh wait, wait a second,
Cecilia,
Dorothy
And this is Kennet
And Bamby.
This is my son Sigmund
And my wife Fay
And my daughter Anna
And that's my sister Lily
Lily ? I was close.
It's a beautiful family.
Thank You.
Have a seat.
Why don't I start ?
The simplest way to put it,
I have problems.
I worry about diseases,so,
I have trouble touching things,
In public places it's almost impossible.
I have a real big problem moving.
Talk about moving.
As long as I'm in my apartment, I'm ok.
But when I go out, I get WEIRED !
Talk about weired.
Talk about weired.
Well, I get desease spams, ellosia,
Cold sweats,
Hot Sweats,
fiber blestures,
difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing,
Bird Vision,involntary tremble
Dead ends, nom lips,
Finger nails sensitivity,
Pelvis discomfort,
So the real question is, what is the crisis ?
What is that you're trully affraid of ..
What if my heart stops beating ?
What if ... I'm looking for a bathroom , I can't find it...
and my bladder exploses...
Do you ever heard of thread syndrom ?
Involontary shouting profanity..
It's exceptionnaly rare ...
SHUT IT SON OF A BITCH !
BASTARD !
Why exactly are you doing this ?
If I fake it, then I don't have it !
You know it's the same with the cardiac arrest.
Are you married ?
I'm divorced.
Would you like to talk about that ?
There are two types of people in this world.
Those who like Neil Daemon
and those who don't.
My ex-wife loves him.
I see,
So, what you're saying is
that even you are an almost paralyzed,
multi-phobic personality that he's in a constant state of panic,
your wife did not leave you, you left her,
because she liked Neil Daemon
No, you're saying that maybe,
maybe I didn't leave her because she likes Neil Daemon,
but maybe, she left me ?
Yes.
Oh Oh Oh Oh ....
Dr Marvin,
You can help me, for the first time in my life,
I feel like there's hope !
I feel like I can be somebody.
Bob, there's an old saying,
that's the best psychiatric in the world,
is the one right inside of you.
Yeah...
I can help you, yes.
Thank you.
Bob, there is a ground-breaking new book, that has just come out,
Now, I have writed this book, of course it applies to you, but,
I'm sure that you can see
when you see the title,
exactly how it could help.
Baby Steps ?
It means setting small reasonnable goals for yourself
one day at a time.
On tiny step at a time
Baby steps
For Instance, hum...
When you leave this office,
don't think about everything you have to do
in order to get out of the building,
just think to what you must do to
get out of this room,
and when you get to the hall,
deal with that hall,
and so ...
You see ?
Baby steps !
Baby steps.
Oh boy !
Baby steps, baby steps,
baby steps through the office,
baby steps out the door,
it works !
it works !
All I have to do ..
just take one little step at a time,
and I can do anything !
Baby step throughout the office, Baby step throughout the office.
That should give you a lot to digest while I'm on vacation..
v..vacation ?
Oh, certainly my secretary told you,
as this afternoon I'm taking my family on vacation
until labour day.
That's a month !
What if I need you ? What if I need to talk ?
Well my associate, Dr Armand, will be happy to talk...
and Bob, I'll be back !
Just read baby steps.
Baby steps, out of the office.
Very good.
Baby steps to the hall.
Very good Bob, keep going.
That's it !
Bye.
I'll see you in a month !
Baby steps to the elevator,

I'm sorry Mr Willey, But Dr Marvin's out...
It's Bob and you are ?
Betty
Betty, Hi !
Bob, Dr Marvin's out of town, and Dr Armand is taking his cause,
I know that Betty,
It's just the expense of confusion,
I was supposed to call Dr Marvin,
but I've lost his phone number.
Bob, I can't give out that number.
I know that Betty,
But you could call him on the other line,
and tell him that I'm on hold on the other line, could you please ?
Thanks Betty please ...
Phone Daddy..
Thank you Anna.
Thank you sweet heart.
Yes.
Dr Marvin, this is Betty at your exchange,
I'm sorry to disturb you but,
I have a Bob Willey on the line
who says you wants to talk to him
Betty you know better than that ...
Dr Armand is covering for me
I told him that Doctor,
but he lost your number and then it was urgent.
All right, put him through
Go ahead bob.
This is Dr Marvin, what's the problem Bob ?
Dr Marvin, how's the wheater up there ?
What ?
How's your brewd ?
You're gonna get the chance to relax ?
Bob ...
I thought I made it clearly,
I'm on vacation,
Well I know,
but I'm just worst as usual this time, really bad.
Bob, if this is really an emergency,
go to the ER.
And if it isn't call Dr Armand,
I'm sure he can help you.

Put her through
Go ahead.
It's not you, it's me.
Lily ? What's wrong ?
Dr Marvin, please don't be hangry, this is Bob.
I know that I shouldn't be calling..
Bob, the doctor patient relationship is based
on trust, and when you call me pretenting to be my sister,
I can't trust you anymore.
Go to the ER, please, do not call me here again!
No no no no...
That was not smart !

Siggy, I have the whole house to fix,
all the art to hang,
I have no idea whenever I will be on the TV show,

On a boat on the lake.
Very far away from the dock.
Into the wind, with the sky and everything.

- Daddy, I am just...
- I can't hear you !
- Where are you Anna ?
- I'm just having fun with my friends !
- And Bob Willey.
- Yes and Bob Willey !
- Bob Willey is your father's patient
- Bob Willey is a very sensitive person !
- Your father's sensitive ?
- Bob listens to people !
- You father listens to people !
- Except when he's up here on lake Winnipesaukee.
He is FUN !
You father is ... kinda fun.
I'm Fay Marvin.
Doctor Marvin's wife.
And I'm very happy to be on your program.
And these are our childrens, Anna and Siggy.
I'm a failure.
What ?
Going on national television tomorrow as an expert on human behaviour,
and in the space of the last hour, both of my childrens
told me that they hate me.
Come on, you know they don't mean it.
Anna accused me of being insensitive.
No, what she actually said was,
I was insensitive,
and I didn't listen,
and I wasn't any fun,
and that Bob Willey was...
Give me...
Some time...
To blow the man down...
You see something different about me ?
- No.
- Do you sail ?
- No.
Well I just picked that up
What am I going to pick up next ?
- Try diving !
- All right ! Diving !
I know a great teacher.
My dad, he just dropped me into the water, without warning me first.
I mean, I nearly drunked.
My whole life flashed before my eyes.
Well you're lucky you're only 12!
That still grim.
I mean what is it with him and diving ?
What's the big deal ?
Well .. he ...
Wow...
He probably just want you to beat it, that's all.
You know he probably just want you to dive, because you're affraid of diving.
Didn't I tell you I sailed on my first try ?
I just let the boat do the work,  that was my secret.
But, with diving, what's the thing ?
- What's the trick ?
- I don't know
It's supposed to be easy.
Can you give me a handle on it ?
Thanks.
- Careful, oh careful !
- Let's go to the edge.
Go to the Edge!
Come on toes off, close to the edge.
Don't worry.
- Come on!
- Let's call this the edge, right here, this is the edge.
Ok, step out this edge.
Now walk up to our edge.
Okay
Got you.
Bend your knees.
Bend your knees.
Very good.
Bend your knees.
- Stick to the board.
- I am sticked to the board.
Just a second, no rush.
Just a second, it's my first dive.
Well I can't see what you're doing,
why don't you get first ?
Hey careful, hold it hold it!
- Come up, come up
- Hold it , hold it!
- Hold my shirt, I'll show you.
- I got it.
- Okay, bend my knees.
Bend your knees.
Hands forward.
Stick to the board.
Honey,

You don't want them to discover a sevirely disturbed patient sleeping on one of my coaches !
There's an extra bed in Siggy's room.
- Fay !!
- Leo, you were very upset over Anna and Siggy...
It's your chance to show what kind of guy
Leo Marvin really is...
Come on sweetie.
Come on.
Bob, We would love for you to spend the night.
That's a great idea !
Do you have a pillow ?
Sure, sure ! Anna would you get a pillow and some sheets for Bob ?

Siggy, would you get one of you father's ropes for Bob ?
Yeah !
Are you sure I'm not imposing ?
Oh no ! Not at all !

Do you care which bed ?
Well I prefer facing south-east.
This one.
Did you find a tooth brush ?
Yes.
Fay, you know where my new tooth brush is ?
In the bathroom.
I know it should be in the bathroom but it is not in the bathroom !
Leo, honey, juste because you're going on television tomorrow
this isn't giving you any right being so snippy !
It is not that that is making me snippy!
- It's him !
- Him who ?
Bob ?
Yes Bob !
Who else am I talking about ?
- Quiet, he would hear you !
- So what if he hears me ! It's my house ins't it ?
Don't you get it ? He faked suicide !
Wasn't that a cry for help ?
What is the matter with all of you ?
Don't you understand ?
This man is crazy !
I mean, for all we know, he could be a...
Mass Murderer !
Oh Come on Leo !
He's a sweet guy !
He's perfectly harmless !
Maybe a little nevrotic, but
not crazy.
Don't you realize, that everything he's done,
violates the doctor/patient relationship ?
And now he's in there,
with our son !
Bob ?
Yeah ?
Are you affraid of death ?
Yeah ...
Me too...
Ther's no way out of it ...
You're going in to die..

Much sooner you get it...
Do you know how fast does time goes ?

Hi ! I'm Mary Grady.
That's an honor to get you in Good Morning America.
I watch your stuff all the time !
- Aren't we jumping out too early ?
- No ! Not at All !
- I'm Derek Catrell the director.
And this is our producer Larry Binds.
- Nice to meet you.
- Well, may we come in ?
- Ya ! Oh sure !
This is our home,
I was thinking of something by the fire ?
It's frieplace shot fellows !
This is even nicer than the pictures.
Thank You.
Is this your family ?
Yes, yes it is.
Oh ! Excuse me, I'm sorry,

And my son ... hmm
- Siggy ?

Oh ! Hi ! I'm Mary.
Hello Mary, I'm Bob.
Yes, that was Bob,
He's a patient he lives down the road.
Dr Marvin, what a great idea !
A Baby Step real action !
- What ?
- Oh, Dr Marvin's gonna get a patient with him.
Fine, Lenny listen up how we should shot this fire place.
Let's set up over here and shoot.
Oh ! Wait a minute !
No problem Dr Marvin ! We can still use the fire place.
You on one side and bob on the other.
I don't think it's such a good idea to have a patient on with me.
- It is !
- It is ?
Yeah ! It's a great idea !
The the better way to show the effectiveness of your book,
is to have a patient on with you!
I think it's a fireplace shot.
Can I speak to you outside for just one second ?
Thank you so much.
I worked very hard to be where I am, you understand me ?
- Screwing alone, yes.
- I don't want you on the show with me, do you understand ?
- I think I do.
- I'll make up some excuse.
Dr Marvin, Bob can we have you for a minute in please ?
- I can't Dr Marvin doesn't want ...
- Eh eh eh ! No ! Get in there !
They're waiting for us !
Right this way.
In ...

One
We're back and we're now going to our live style reporter
Mary Grady and the Lake Winnipesaukee New Hampshire
And Mary what is so special about Lake Winnipesaukee ?
Well Jone, among other things,
it's the summer home of Dr Leo Marvin.
Author of the newest sensational therapy in Baby Steps.
And with Dr Marvin is Bob Willey
who is a patient and obviously a
big fan of Baby Steps Therapy.
Good Morning Dr Marvin, Bob.
- Good Morning
- Good Morning
Now clearly, to come on national television live
with a patient, shows a remarquable amount of confidence
in your methods.
False Alarm.
Sorry.
Okay ?
Good.
Now, Dr Marvin.
Exactly how does Baby Steps work on someone like Bob ?
Well Jone, I'm very proud of Baby Steps, enormously gratified by its success,
I think the greatest challenge aside for the writing,
is finding ways to make the ideas accessible to everyone.
Hum, Bob, Tell us your impressions of Baby Steps.
I couldn't be happier about Baby Steps
I was a total disaster
and now, because of this man
this morning I'm on TV in front of
millions and millions of people
I don't even think Dr Marvin know what is going on,
he can't believe what's going on.
I'm very excited !
You know it sounds like a very intriguing process.
How long have you been a patient of Dr Marvin ?
Book is not really ment to work that quickly !
It only worked that quickly with Boub.
Boub ?
Bob.
You can call me Boub.
No, I don't want to call you Boub.
Even if you did as an accident.
No ! I really don't want to call him Boub,
the book isn't make to work that quick.
But it did work that way !
That's the miracle !
The Miracle of Baby Steps.
It's not just this book.
It's this man.
It's the compation.
It's the dignity, the wisdom.
It's the horse sense,
of the guy.
That gets you !
He actually had me stay here last night in his jammies.
Using his tooth brush.
In his house.
And, I spent the day swmming,
sailing with his family.
Fay, Anna and Siggy, come here !
Here is the fam' !
The Marvins.
This is Fay, Anna and Siggy.
I want diving with testerday.
Doctor Marvin pushed me in,
You have a very nice family,
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.
Mary, you are wise,
what do I say to someone who has turned my whole life
forever and who is giving some much of time and vacation
to make me better.
What I'd really like to do is put the greatness of this man in perspective.
I think there's really only 3 names
Dr Albert Schweitzer,
Mother Trice of Calcuta probably,
and Leo Marvin.
The book is Baby Steps, the author is Dr Leo Marvin,
and we've been talking with Bob Willey
Pretty impressive stuff Bob !
Dr Marvin.
Back to you June.
Way to go Bobby !
That was wonderful Bob !
Thank you very much Mary.
We can come out after a few month and talk about your problems ?
Hum, as long as it is ok with my doctor ?
What ?
Oh !
Absolutely !
That's a very good idea !
Ok Great !
Come on dad ! We're taking a picture !
- Come on !
- Come on Dr Marvin !
- Come on !
- No...
You got that ...
All right.
- How long do you stay ?
- Just till labour day and then we go back to New York City.
Ok.. Big smiles everybody !
Cheeeeeeeeeeese !
Ok, bye bye.
Good Bye Mary.
Bye bye.
That was nice talking to you !
They're so nice !
You wer great Bob !
You really were !
You were incredible !
I mean dad shocked, you saved him !
Here is the one who made me happy !
- Oh Sweetie !
- Dr Leo Marvin !
Get Out...
No we won't get out ! You deserve it !
I mean , GET OUT !
GET OUT !!
Is it something I said ?
You ruined my life !
You ruined my career !
You ruined my book !
You put a perfectly peaceful house into an insame asylum !
Get out !!
- Daddy !
- What's got into you ?
It was a disaster Fay !
No it wasn't you were wonderful sweetie !
You were fine dad !
Why do you need to keep Bob out of the house ?
You think he's gone ?
He's not gone !
That's the all point !
He's never gone !!
Is this some radical new therapy ?
YOU SEE ??
We can't be expected to understant,
he's so far above us !
We're like ropes on a goodyear blim.
Are you all right ?
I want to apologies to you for that terrible outverse,
I'm trully sorry.
call it the show-business nerves.
Oh, we can all certainly understand that !
A lot of people freeze on TV dad !
Thank you.
Bob...
how do you feel about you and me having a little talk ?
Just me and you ?
I think I'dle like to spend a little time with you,
pay you back, for all the time you spent with me.
What do you say ?
Do you feel like for a little ride ?
Do I ??
- This is so sweet !
- It's really nice dad !
Look how happy he is !
Try to be home by 7.
Where we're going ?
Intensive psychotherapy.
Waow !
Okay !
Some free association from my infancy...
A beach ball
A dog
A frog
A lock
A puddle
A nuddle
A duddle
Dr Marvin to see Dr Tobski.
Dr Leo Marvin.
Err Main building Doctor, they're expecting you.
Hey, you're Bob Willey aren't you ?
- Yeah !
- I saw you on TV, you were great !
Ah !
Hello Leo ! Long time no see !
Sorry, I missed your show this morning.
Well this is the friend you called about !
Bob Willey ! I would like you to meet your new pal, Dr Tobski.
Hello Bob.
New Pal ?
What's wrong with my old pal ?
Would you show Mr Willey to his room please ?
Oh no, wait a second doctor, doctor !
You come with me don't you ?
I have compulsions, my bladder is feeling funny !
Really appreciating you're helping me on this Catherine.
I can only hold him for 24 hours Leo, without staff corraboration.
Not to worry about that !
I'm sure your entire staff will corroborate !
Thank you, Thank you very much Catherine.
- You're welcome !
- Thank you.
Ahh, you see Bob,
I will not be defeated !
I won't negociate and I won't compromise the defeat !
Cigarret Bob ?
Oh ! Sorry !
I didn't realize you wear administrate jacket !
Honey,
Catherine Tobski's on the phone.
Allo ?
What ?
No !
No !!
- Son of a bitch !
- Where's Bob ?
- Son of a bitch !!
- Where's Bob ??
Honey ! Where's Bob ?
What about Bob ?
What about Bob ?
WHAT ABOUT BOB ?
It's a female !
Do you think I'm wearing something ?
But, it reminds me my favorite poem,
which is ..
Well this is a red,
fouled as a blue,
I'm a skit as franck
and so am I.
So the psychiatrist says...
It's not the joke yet !
Wait a second ...
He draws a picture of a tree, what do you think of that one ?
He answered sex, ok, he draws the picture of a car, sex, sex
Then the doctor says, you're obssesed with sex !
And the patient says, oh ! you're the one drawing dirty pictures !
I'm giving you back your admitting form Leo,
to save you an embarassment.
- EMBARASSMENT ?
- Yeah !
Catherine ! You have been dubted, by a brilliant sociopath !
Brilliant enough to dubt my entire staff ?
I doubt that !
Look, it's perfectly natural for a patient to bind with his analyst !
If you want to be rid of him, just tell him you won't treat him anymore !
Catherine, that's easy for you to say !
The man is human crazy-glue !
You should have never let him sleep in your pijamas Leo !
I can't believe I'm hearing this !
Relax Leo !
I'm relaxed !!
Take a vacation !
I'm on vacation !!
Maybe you should check in here for a few days...
We can handle on things.
It was an interesting morning, fruitful,
but it lacks the intensity that you and I generate together.
the sparks that we get one on one
we should discut out a way to work around your schedule,
do we work afternoons ?
Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday ?
You think we'd rather work on mornings ?
Get Out !!
It's a combustible relationship isn't it ?
Is it just you and me ?
or it it you and everybody ?
Hoy !
Excuse me Officer ?
Can you please make sure he's home by 7 ?
Hey ! Didn't I see that guy on TV ?
Oh Damn !
Son of a Bitch !
I'm Home !
Fay !
We're all here sweetie !
SURPRISE !
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU !
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU !
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR MARVIN !
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU !
Dad, what happend ?
Dad ?
Honey, you're a mess !
Are you all right ?
Oh yeah yeah !
Just a little car trouble !
Ohhh on your birthday ...
Happy birthday Leo !
HAPPY BIRTHDAY LEO !
Sweetie, we have a great big surprise for you !
You sister Lily is here from Chicago !
Happy birthday Leo !
Lily !!
We are all here for you Dr M. !
This is your night !
DON'T TOUCH MY SISTER !
I've never seen him like this Phil...
He's been under a lot of stress Fay,
Bob, his interview which didn't go so well...
- And his birthday...
- Exactly...
Phil, do you think Leo was surprised ?
Oh I think so !
- How is he ?
- I'm leaving a prescription for PROZAC.
Excuse me Phil, but with these particular symptoms, is PROZAC the right choice ?
You think PROZAC is a mistake ?
For this kind of episode, I would says LIBERRINE is a more effective management tool.
You could be right, I'll rewrite the prescription.
Bob, why do you think Leo act to you like that ?
I don't know ! He's been tensed today,
But don't worry, no matter how long it takes, I'm gonna stay on and help the family to be the daddy !
You are such a good friend !
Leo is lucky to have you !
Thank you sweetie !
Oh, no problem !
It's been a real pleasure !
Keep me posted !
Okay !
- Bye Lily !
- Good Bye
Bye Lily !
This is so hard Bob, but...
We're not defending Leo's behaviour in anyway so...
please don't take this personnaly !
Oh no...
That how irrational the reasons, Leo is so upset at you,
We just think it would be best if you're not here when he wakes up.
Please, that's not the way I want it !
Me either.
Or me.
You want me to go ?
I'm sorry.
Really ?
Good Bye.
Later !
- Good bye Bob !
- Bye Anna !
- Take care of yourself !
- Okay , and you take care of Leo !
Just temporarly disconnected, that's all !
You know, I've got to tell you !
I've got the greatest vacation with you all !
No ! Too messy !
No ! Not painfull enough !
Yes !
He's not at the dock !
He's not downstairs !
Let's get the car ! Come on !

But Dr Godswell didn't think I was ready...
And Dr Rosingay and Tcheski.
I was certainly not ready for Malestine or Miller.
But with you ! Finnally , I'm ready !
What do you think is the difference between the others guys and me Bob ?
Is that now I'm gonna kill you !
But if you shoot me, our therapy will be over !
I'm not gonna shoot you Bob !
I don't think I can shoot anybody !
I'm gonna blow you up !
This is called black powder Bob !
Here you go !
How much is this ?
You understand don't you ?
That there is no other solution !
You won't go away !
- I will !
- No you won't !
You're just saying you will,
But after, if I don't kill you, you show up again.
And you make everyone in my life think you are wonderful
and I'm a schmock
I'm not a schmock Bob !
And I won't let you take my family away, just beacause you're crazy engouh to be fun !
You'll take care of Gil for me ?
Yeah don't worry ! I'll feed him until is big jelly is fat !
