DJ:
Get up, get up, you sleepyheads.
Get up, get out of bed.
Good morning
Angel Beach. lt's April 12th.
This is Gene Morrison
coming from WACN, Angel Beach...
nestled by the shore
in South Florida.
lt's a bright,
beautiful spring day...
PEE WEE: Get it up.
DJ: ...and steady on the helm.
The stars are secure
in the firmament...
and the rent's
paid for the month...
so all's right with the world.
So get up, get up,
you sleepyheads.
Get up, get out of bed.
Let's get out there
and get America moving forward.
lt's 64 degrees,
expected to reach a high of 76.
No rain in sight.
Good news for the beach bunnies,
but bad news for farm boys.
Now, to help you start
the day...
the singing rage,
Miss Patti Page.
PATTl PAGE:
Tra la la...
Tweedle dee dee dee...
lt gives me a thrill...
MOTHER: Edward.
You'll be late for school.
Edward! Up! Right now!
l got things to do, you hear?
Hit the floor right now!
Edward Morris!
PEE WEE: Aah! Ooh.
You be at the breakfast table
in five minutes...
or you don't play ball
this week.
MOTHER: What's wrong?
PEE WEE: Nothing. l pulled
a little muscle in my groin.
MOTHER: Be careful.
Your father wants you
to drop him off at work.
Car won't start.
And pick up those clothes
at the tailor's.
PEE WEE: Ahh! lnstant eunuch.
Shit!
Ohh, it is.
lt's getting shorter!
Shit!
BlLLY:
Did you get the colored guy?
TOMMY: Does a fat dog fart?
BlLLY: What's he look like?
TOMMY:
Like an African Zulu man!
Six-foot-four,
two huge gold teeth.
BlLLY: Great!
BlLLY: Where'd you find him?
TOMMY: Works for my old man's
construction company.
Doesn't know
what l'm talking about...
but he's willing,
and he'll do it for $10.
BlLLY: 10 bucks. Not bad.
TOMMY: The broad's all set?
BlLLY:
No problem there. She's--
BlLLY:
Jarvis, you stupid redneck!
You better duck, you suckers,
when Jarvis is at the wheel!
MlCKEY:
Billy boy, y'all get the nigger?
BlLLY: Come on, you mean
the colored guy, the negro.
TOMMY: Poor white trash.
MlCKEY: Fuck you
and the horse you rode in on.
TOMMY: ''Fuck you and the horse
you rode in on''?
That's colorful redneck humor.
MlCKEY:
Right. Kiss my rebel ass!
TOMMY: That's another one.
BlLLY:
We should write these down.
MlCKEY: lmmigrants. Go back
to Oklahoma and Michigan...
and kiss ass
with all the negroes you want.
This is Dixie, baby,
where we do things right.
TOMMY: Why don't you
have four first names...
like most hillbillies?
Like Billy Joe Jim Bob
or Flora Mae Sally Sue?
MlCKEY: l had a cousin
named Billy Joe Jim Bob...
and he was killed in the war,
so watch what you're saying.
TOMMY: l didn't know, Mickey.
l'm sorry.
MlCKEY:
Anyway, did you get the negro?
TOMMY: We got one.
BlLLY:
Guy's 6'4'', has gold teeth.
He's the meanest-looking
mother you ever saw.
MlCKEY: They'll croak
when this guy jumps out!
WENDY:
Hey, Tommy! Wait a minute.
Did you get it?
TOMMY: l found a place
with one. l'll go tomorrow.
WENDY: Don't let me down.
l'm gonna get that creep.
MlCKEY: Who's she gonna get?
TOMMY: Pee Wee.
Didn't you hear
about the other night?
MlCKEY: No.
-You didn't?
-No.
TOMMY: We figured we gotta
get Pee Wee laid...
so l fix him up with Wendy.
MlCKEY: Pee Wee and Wendy?
l thought she had better taste.
BlLLY: All he had to do
was knock it off.
They're making out.
You know Wendy.
She reaches down,
unzips his fly...
and she grabs his cock.
And guess what.
MlCKEY: What?
BlLLY:
Bastard already had a rubber on.
MlCKEY: Oh, bullshit!
BlLLY: l swear. Wendy told me.
Why would she lie?
He wore a rubber to his date.
TOMMY: She got so pissed off,
she wouldn't let him touch her.
MlNDY: Hi. My name is Mindy.
Can l ask you something?
MEAT: Yeah.
Why do they call you ''Meat''?
MEAT: Uh, l don't know.
Wendy Williams
told me l should ask you.
-She did, huh?
-Uh-huh.
MlNDY:
Why do they call you ''Meat''?
'Cause you're so big?
MEAT: Uh, yeah, sorta.
MlNDY: Not sorta. Why?
MEAT: You really want to know?
MlNDY: Yes!
MEAT:
OK. Come on. l'll show you.
BOY: Meat, wait.
She's a only freshman.
MEAT: But after this,
she'll be an instant senior.
BOY: Listen,
if you get suspended again...
you'll never get that
scholarship to Princeton.
Think about that.
MEAT:
l'm sorry, babe. Can't do it.
He won't tell me.
Ah, shoot.
PEE WEE: Wait up!
MlCKEY: Speaking of
horny mothers, it's Ready Eddie!
PEE WEE: Be serious.

TOMMY: l don't know. Even
nymphomaniacs have standards.
MlCKEY:
She lives with a big black stud.
lf he catches you,
he'll cut your pecker off.
BlLLY: He's bringing
a pair of tweezers.
PEE WEE:
She likes to screw, right?
TOMMY: She loves it.
Especially young guys.
The more the merrier.
PEE WEE: What's she look like?
ls she good looking?
BlLLY: She's not bad.
She's got a great body,
moves like an eel.
PEE WEE: That's the way
l like 'em, Tommy!
MlCKEY: You like 'em
as long as they're not dead.
PEE WEE: As long as
they're not too cold.
Wait! Come here!
Let's not invite too many guys.
That way we can get her twice.
MlCKEY: Midget's not invited,
and he's making the guest list.
PEE WEE: You bastards,

You're not cutting me

BlLLY:

TlM: What eggs?
PEE WEE: Those eggs!
TlM: Oh, these eggs.
They're for you.
PEE WEE: For me?
TlM: We thought you might

PEE WEE: Timmy!
Funny.
You gotta let me

TlM: l don't think

PEE WEE:
There's gotta be somebody!
BlLLY: l think we've done

PEE WEE: Let me do Meat.
You gotta let me.
Come on, Timmy.
TlM: OK.
TlM: Now, listen,

That's the one you drop.
The one in your right

That's the one you hit him with.
PEE WEE: Left hand, raw.
Right hand, smacko!
TlM: Get him, Tiger.
PEE WEE: Hi, Meat.
MEAT: Hi. What's going on?
PEE WEE: Oh, nothing.

PEE WEE: These eggs?
MEAT: ls there an echo here?
PEE WEE: They're for you.
MEAT:

PEE WEE: We thought

MEAT: Morris, you're dead.
PEE WEE: l know.
TlM: Watch it, it's Kong!
TOMMY: Good morning,
Miss Balbricker.

PEE WEE: Miss Walker!
BRlAN: Nice pass.
TlM: Too bad, Jew boy.
TOMMY: What's your problem?
ROY: Would l like

FRED: Ah, yes. Lassie.
Lassie?
Patience, my boy.
Why do you call her Lassie?
-Why do you think?
-l don't know.
Owwwoooo!
Are you kidding?
You call her a dog?
Fred, that's angel food cake.
You touch her...
the food and drug administration

What can l tell you?
You can tell me

Get her in the equipment room.
You'll find out.
What are you talking about?
FRED: But beware of King Kong.
Wait a minute.
Come here, Fred.
PEE WEE: Hi, Miss Walker.
WALKER: Hi, Pee Wee.
Tommy, Miss Walker's hot.
She just said ''Hi'' to you.
But did you see the way
she said ''Hi'' to me?
Right, Pee Wee.
TOMMY: Boy, Miss Balbricker...
you put a lot of weight
behind that one.
Coach, would you kindly...
keep your balls off
my tumbling mat?
Beg your pardon?
The basketballs.
Would you kindly keep them
in your court?
l have little enough room
for my girls as it is.
l'll take care of that.
Thank you.
PEE WEE: Girls' tumbling team

PEE WEE:

You aren't even allowed...
to look at her
with her clothes on!
Little dip.
Hey, Tim, l think maybe
we oughta invite Brian tonight.
TlM:
Why do we gotta invite a Jew?
All we need now
is a communist and a spic...
and we'd have the whole thing.
BlLLY:
You're really the tolerant type.
l notice
you still include yourself.
TlM: Broads are broads.
l just don't see
why we gotta invite a kite.
BlLLY: Brian's a good guy.
He's only been here
a couple months.
Why don't you
give him a chance?
TlM: He's a jerk,
and a Jew jerk at that.
BlLLY:
All right! We won't ask him.
You're a case, Cavanaugh.
PEE WEE: They just went in!

So how do l get her up there?
Put a rope around her neck?
Put handcuffs on her?
Guile, charm, persuasion...
And if that doesn't work,
just ask her.
Ask her.
BlLLY: So what happened?
Two day's suspension?
TOMMY:
Two games and 2,000 laps.
You're kidding?

MEAT: What the hell is this?
MlCKEY: Sheriff's office.
MEAT: Sheriff of Wallacetown?
Where the hell's Wallacetown?

TlM: Well, fuck you!
MlCKEY:

Angel Beach pussies.
A little smelly.

Shit!
TED: Where were you headed?
MlCKEY: Back to Porky's.
TED:

MlCKEY:

BALBRlCKER: The girls

ROY: All right, shake hands.
ROY: Go on.
BlLLY: How did you learn
to fight like that?
BRlAN: When you're Jewish...
you either learn to fight,
or you take a lot of shit.
l don't like to take shit...
so l studied boxing and jujitsu.
TOMMY:
That Japanese stuff, right?
BlLLY:
How often have you used it?
BRlAN: This was the first time.
TOMMY: Were you sure
you'd remember how?
BRlAN: Well, l was hoping.
BlLLY:
Look, Brian, Tim's our buddy...
but you got to understand
he's got problems.
BRlAN: Yeah, l noticed.
BlLLY: lt's easy for him
to take it out on you...
'cause he thinks
you're putting him down.
He's not a bad guy.
BRlAN: He's a prick.
TOMMY:
You're right. He's a prick.
BlLLY: He's a smuck.
-What?
-A smuck.
BlLLY:
That's Jewish for prick, right?
BRlAN: Yeah, sort of.
TOMMY: Yeah, well, anyway,
even though he's a schmuck...
and we don't like
everything he does...
but he's still our buddy,
you know?
BlLLY: Yeah.
BRlAN: l understand.
Well, listen, l got to go.
See you guys later.
BlLLY: Take it easy, Brian.
TOMMY: So long, Brian.
PEE WEE: l'm gonna get her.

WAlTRESS: Wendy,

WENDY: You got it.
Deadbeats.
PEE WEE: Uh, hello. Hi.

And l mean that literally.
BOYS: Ooh!
PEE WEE: lt worked. it worked.
TOMMY: Way to go, kiddo!
PEE WEE: Michael Hunt!
BRlAN:
Billy, what's wrong with Meat?
l thought he didn't drink.
BlLLY: Well, he doesn't.
But he just found out today

MEAT: Princeton sucks!
lt sucks!
BRlAN: l thought he had offers

BlLLY: He does, but he had
his heart set on Princeton.
MEAT:
This chili tastes like shit!
MEAT: Ohhh.
BlLLY: Oh, shit.
Pee Wee, get me some sugar
from the end of the counter?
OFFlCER:
That boy been drinking?
BlLLY: No, sir, officer.
Our friend is a diabetic.
TOMMY: Thank you, Edward,
for bringing the sugar.
How many cubes of sugar
does your cousin require...
when he's had too much insulin?
Two...cubes of sugar...
usually is enough
to bring Anthony around.
BlLLY:
Oh, feel better now, huh?
OFFlCER: Gee, uh...
l've never seen anybody
drown in chili before.
SECOND OFFlCER: Me, neither.
l wouldn't even know how
to fill out the forms on that.
OFFlCER: Yeah, you're right.
lt'd be a lot of hassle.
We better save him.
Yeah, l guess we'd better.
SECOND OFFlCER:
You know, l'm not a doctor...
but l could swear
this youngster's inebriated.
BOYS: Oh, no. No, sir.
OFFlCER: Well, if you guys say
he's a diabetic, OK.
But if we find out he's drunk...
we gonna book the lot of you
as accessories.
-He's smashed.
-Bombed.
PEE WEE: Son of a bitch
does it all the time!
PEE WEE: Ahem !
BRlAN: Officer, excuse me...
but l couldn't help but notice
what's been happening.
OFFlCER: Who are you?
BRlAN: Just a bystander.
Brian Schwartz is my name.
Don't know
if this is important...
l overheard
this poor fellow saying...
that the reason
he'd gotten drunk tonight...
was that his girlfriend
had just broken up with him.
Wouldn't you toss down a few...
if the woman you loved
turned her back on you?
SECOND OFFlCER: lf my wife
left, l'd get drunk for joy.
OFFlCER: All right.
Get him out of here,
and get him home...now.
BRlAN: Thank you, officer.
BlLLY: Will do. Thank you.
TOMMY: You're
one smooth mother, Schwartz.
BRlAN: You do what you can.
WENDY: lt's Mickey.
TOMMY: Porky's.
PEE WEE: Shit.
TOMMY: Here we go again.
PEE WEE: Holy shit!
Oh, shit.
BlLLY: Did you whip him?
MlCKEY: Hell, yes!
l used my face to break
the son of a bitch's hand.
BlLLY: Pee Wee,
you better go call Ted.
MlCKEY: l don't feel so good.
BlLLY: l hate to do this...
but we better get him
to a hospital.
TOMMY: l'll get my car.
MlCKEY: Hospital?
TOMMY: Mickey, where you going?
MlCKEY: l'm going home,
you son of a bitch.
Don't worry, ol' buddy.
l learned my lesson.
BlLLY: We're gonna have
to baby-sit with him.
TOMMY: That won't stop him.
PEE WEE: You see Timmy's face?
TOMMY: Yeah, we saw it.
TlM: Shorts, shirt...
MEAT: You really worked him
over, didn't you, Schwartz?
BRlAN: Hey, l didn't do that.
Hardly touched his face,
just a few little jabs.
BlLLY: No. You didn't do it.
BRlAN: What happened?
TOMMY: His old man.
BRlAN: His father? Why?
BlLLY: 'Cause he got into
a fight with a Jew and lost.
MEAT: lt's not your fault.
BRlAN: Uh, Coach, can l talk
to you about Cavanaugh?
ROY: Oh, come on.
LYNN:
You know l don't go all the way.
ROY: Who said anything
about going all the way?
We're just gonna go up
and have a cup of coffee...
in the equipment room.
LYNN: No! No, no, no, no.
ROY:
l'll tell you a little secret.
LYNN: l already know that.
BALBRlCKER:
Miss Honeywell, do you mind?
LYNN: Do l mind what?
BALBRlCKER: lt's disgusting!
The two of you...
squirming about...
like a pair of eels in heat!
You're a disgrace.
LYNN: Yeah? lt beats stomping
and waddling around...
like a frigid hippopotamus,
Beulah.
BALBRlCKER:
What did you call me?
LYNN:
Beulah. Beulah Balbreaker.
BALBRlCKER: Who do you think
you're talking to?!
LYNN: Well, if l heard
a hurdy-gurdy playing...
l'd think l was talking
to the fat lady in the circus!
But l guess l'm talking
to a ton of bad news...
named Beulah! Beulah! Beulah!
-Look, ladies--
-You butt out!
BALBRlCKER: Moral turpitude!
-What?
-Moral turpitude!
BALBRlCKER: Read your contract,
Miss Honeywell.
l'll have you fired
for moral turpitude!
LYNN: You can take
your moral turpitude...
and you can stick it up
the old gazoo, Beulah!
ROY:
Gee, Lynn, l don't know.
Moral turpitude.
LYNN: Oh, come on!
FRED: All right, Brian.
ROY: Wh-wh-whoa!
FRED:
l'll talk to Coach Goodenough.
BRlAN: l appreciate it.
FRED:
But don't expect too much.
Come on.
We're late for practice.
LYNN: Oohhh...
Oh, smell.
Oh, smell that air.
Mmmm ! Oh, boy!

ROY: Who cares?
LYNN: Oh! Oh! Oh!

BALBRlCKER: Now, Mr. Carter...
l know this
is completely unorthodox...
but l think
this is the only way...
to find that boy.
Now, that penis
had a mole on it.
l'd recognize
that penis anywhere.
ln spite of the juvenile
snickers of some...
this is a serious matter.
That...
That seducer...
and despoiler must be stopped.
He's extremely dangerous.
And, Mr. Carter...
l'm certain that everyone
in this room...
knows who that is.
He's a contemptible
little pervert who's--
MR. CARTER: Miss Balbricker!
BALBRlCKER: Well, l'm sorry,
but l've got him now...
and l'm not going to let him
slip through my fingers again.
Now, all l'm asking
is that you give me...
five boys for a few minutes.
The coaches can be present.
Tommy Turner...
and any four boys
you see fit to choose.
And we...
And we...
can put a stop to this menace.
And it is a menace.
Well?
What are you gonna do about it?
MR. CARTER:
Five young boys in the nude?
A police lineup...
so that you can identify...
his tallywacker?
Please, please.
Can we call it a tallywacker?
Penis is so person--uh...
Penis is so personal.
BALBRlCKER: We can put hoods
over their heads...
MR. CARTER: Hoods?
BALBRlCKER:
to avoid embarrassment.
Now, listen.
We have got to do it...
as distasteful as it is.
l know it's him.
That...
tallywacker...
had a mole on it.
And that mole is the key to it!
MR. CARTER: Miss Balbricker...
do you realize the difficulty
of your request?
Now, l would be very happy...
to apprehend
the young man myself.
But can you imagine...
what the board
of education would say...
if you were granted a lineup...
in order to examine
their private paaa--paa--paa--
their--uh...ahem.
their--the, uh, their--
hmmm--hmmm--hmmm--
their private parts...
for an incriminating mole?
BALBRlCKER: But Mr. Carter...
ROY: Mr. Carter.
l think l have
a way out of this.
We, uh, call the police...
and we have them send over
one of their sketch artists--
and Miss Balbricker
can give a description.
We can put up wanted posters
all over school.
''Have you seen this prick?''
''Report immediately
to Beulah Balbricker.''
''Do not attempt
to apprehend this prick...
''as it is armed and dangerous.''
''lt was last seen hanging out...
''in the girls' locker room
at Angel Beach high school.''
FRED:
There you are. Now let's do it.
TlM: All right.
BlLLY: Hey, Timmy, coach
gonna let you play tonight?
TlM:
Yeah, l've been re-instated.
TOMMY: That's great.
FRED: OK, guys, hit the floor!
PEE WEE: Us little guys
need our enforcer.
FRED: All right, Cavanaugh,
get with it!
RECORD PLAYER: Any time...
You're feelin' lonely...
Any time...
You're feeling blue....
Any time...
You feel downhearted...
WENDY: Beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep!
BlLLY: What's that, Wendy?
WENDY: lt's a shit detector.
Beep! Beep! Beep!
Beep! Beep! Beep!
Beep! Beep!
Beep! Beep!
BlLLY: That is the oldest joke
in the world.
TOMMY: l know.
l liked it.
Where's Mickey?
BlLLY: Meat's with him.
TOMMY: l don't think so.
Hey, Meat!
-Yo!
-Where's Mickey?
MEAT: l don't know, man.
He gave me the slip.
TOMMY: Should we go after?
BlLLY: lt's too late now.
TOMMY: OK.
CAVANAUGH: Come on, Jew boy!
BRlAN: Hey, watch it, buddy!
CAVANAUGH:
Louie, Hymie, Abie, Sam.
We're the boys who eat no ham.
BRlAN: Really get a kick
out of this, don't you?
Oh, you got a big Jew mouth,
just like your big Jew nose.
You're a big man...
when you're kicking
the ass outta kids...
with that sneaky Jap stuff, huh?
Why don't you try
some of that shit on me?
Come on...Jew boy!
TlM: Dad, get out of here.
CAVANAUGH: What?
TlM: You heard what l said.
Well, who you talking to, boy?
Trash, pure trash.
Now, son, that's no way
to talk to your pa.
TlM: l really wish
you wouldn't have said that...
'cause you don't know
how humiliating it is...
to have anybody know
you're my pa.
-Let me go!
-You stay out of this!
TlM: Just make sure
you're finished...
'cause this is the last time...
you ever lay a hand on me
again, you son of a bitch!
MAN: All right!
What's going on here?
CAVANAUGH: Now, you got
any more smart talk?
TED:
All right, Mr. Cavanaugh.
l think we can get you one
to three for felonious assault.
Meanwhile, l'll be glad
to finish this off the record.
TlM: No! Just let him be.
l'm not afraid of him.
l'm not afraid of you!
lf you ever come
near me again...
l swear to God, l'll kill you.
Looks like l'm gonna make
a man outta you yet, boy.
TlM: A man?
lf being a man means
being what you are...
l'd rather be queer.
ROY: l'm having you put
under a peace bond.
Come near this boy again,
l'll have you arrested.
l'll see you again.
TED: l'll be lookin' forward
to that, slime.
ROY: OK, it's over.
Let's get on back to the dance.
BlLLY: You OK?
TlM:
Yeah, l think l'll be all right.
You know you're welcome
to stay with Tommy or l...
as long as you like.
TlM: All right. Thanks.
BlLLY: Why don't you...
ROY: OK, girls, if you're
gonna kiss each other...
let's get it over with.
Otherwise, let's get on back
to the dance, right?
TlM: Right.
PEE WEE: lt's a good thing
Ted stepped in...
or l'd have torn
that sucker a new one.
MEAT: l wonder if he realizes
just how lucky he was?
TOMMY: Now, wait a minute.
Just wait one minute.
Something's wrong here.
l know what it is.
lf we could just...
Yeah.
That satisfies
my sense of proportion.
PEE WEE: Man is not known
by inches alone.
MEAT: Yeah, l got something...
to satisfy your sense
of proportion.
-l'm sure you do.
-Yeah.
BlLLY: What the hell is this
tonight--Looney Tunes?
-Aah!
-Aah!
TOMMY: Oh, Mickey!
MlCKEY: You should see him.
l messed him up good.
l got the pig's tooth.
ROY:
Come on. Step aside! Look out.
ROY: l think he's got
some broken ribs...
maybe a collapsed lung.
Billy, get an ambulance.
No! Don't move him.
Don't move him.
Take off his sweater,
put it behind his head.
Real slow.
TED: l'll see you guys.
TOMMY: Hey, we're going, too.
TED: No, you're not.
lt's bad enough l was going
out of jurisdiction...
without adding a charge...
of contributing
to the delinquency of a minor.
-But--
-No buts, Pee Wee!
TED: l don't wanna see
any of you guys get hurt.
BRlAN: Nobody has to get hurt.
TED:
What are you talking about?
Nobody has to get hurt...
and your career
doesn't have to be in jeopardy.
TED: Well, l'm all for that.
What do you got in mind?
BRlAN: Look, it doesn't have
to happen tonight, right?
TED: No, it doesn't have
to be done tonight.
BRlAN: Good.
Look, let me talk to you
alone for a second, OK?
TED: OK.
ROY: Count me in.
TOMMY: You could get fired.
ROY: Are you kidding?
l gotta be the worst coach
that ever lived.
l'm long gone after
this semester, anyway.
And don't call me coach anymore.
Call me Roy.
Only 23, for Christ sake.
TOMMY: You look much older.
ROY: Why don't you go
and sit on a snake?
You see that right there?
Porky gave me that
about 6 years ago.
l've always wanted
a shot at that mother.
l'd like to feed him
his nuts for lunch.
TED:
OK. Brian's got something.
We're gonna get together
at his place 4:00 Sunday.
BlLLY: What are we gonna do?
TED: Just sit tight.
We're gonna give Porky
a night to remember.
BlLLY: Hey, Brian,
where are you going?
BRlAN: Do some reconnaissance.
TlM: Hey, Brian!
Wait a minute.
Look, when we go to Porky's...
do me a favor, OK?
Don't tell him
your name is Schwartz.
Those guys
are prejudiced out there.
All right. Um...
What about
Paddy Aloysius O'Brien?
Nah, too Jewish.
Let's not take any chances.
All right. What about
Sean Mulcahy Reilly?
PEE WEE: Wait a minute.
Go ahead.
BlLLY: OK. We're just waiting
for the guys under the bridge.
PEE WEE: Ooh! Ow! Oh, shit!
MEAT: Shh!
PEE WEE: Ow! What the--
Son of a bitch.
MEAT: Go on! Will you go?
PEE WEE: Come on.
PEE WEE: Billy! Billy!
Tommy!
BlLLY:
OK. l gotta go relieve coach.
ROY:
Everything go all right?
BlLLY: Like a precision
drill team. Thanks.
ROY: Well, good luck, kiddo.
l'll have everything ready.
BlLLY:
Get ready for Jarvis' revenge!
MEAT: Hey, you know, man,
this better work.
BlLLY: Don't worry.
BRlAN: There it is.
Whoooahhh!
BlLLY: They're ready.
PEE WEE: What do we do now?
BlLLY: Wait.
BRlAN:
All we gotta do now is wait.
PEE WEE: Billy. Billy!
BlLLY: Whoooooo!
Whoooooo!
TlM:
Billy loves those bird calls.
BRlAN: Whoooahhh!
Whoooahhh!
BlLLY: All right.
Now, listen, you guys.
lf there's any sign
of guns or anything...
don't bother hookin' us up.
We're getting the hell out, OK?
PEE WEE:
Listen, Billy, be careful.
WOMAN: Never could get one
to fit me, honey.
BlLLY: Suey!
Sue...su-su-suey!
MAN: What the hell is that?
BlLLY: l want to see Porky.
MAN: Who wants to see Porky?
BlLLY: Tell him the boys
from Angel Beach are here.
Tell him
to bring the best he's got...
and meet us
in the parking lot...now.
MAN: Jesus Christ.
MAN ON RlGHT:
Do you believe that?
Oh, Porky!
The boys from
Angel Beach are here.
BlLLY: Remember, any sign
of guns and we're gone.
PEE WEE: Yo, Billy.
PORKY: Where are
these 5 little virgins...
that think
they've reached manhood?
You want to tangle
your ass with me?
Come up here,
you sawed-off punk!
l'll educate you.
l'll wrap this right around
your damn neck.
BlLLY: Boy, Porky.
We're really scared.
l guess we better go now.
l hope shit floats.
PORKY: You'll float if
l catch you around here again.
MEAT: Come on, Billy!
PEE WEE: Look!
SHERlFF WALLACE: All right!

TED:
Which one's been comin' in?
PORKY: This one and

SHERlFF WALLACE: They've been
comin' in before...

PORKY:
We may have made a mistake.
These obviously aren't
the youngsters.
SHERlFF WALLACE:

Are you crazy? Now, look!
Those boys just destroyed
my station house...

PORKY: Promise him !
For Christ's sake,

SHERlFF WALLACE: l promise

SHERlFF WALLACE:

What's that?
l can't hear you, Sheriff.
l promise, you mother--
l promise.
TED: Now get this car
out of Seward County.
PORKY:
You've blown away our engine.
We got one flat tire. How?
TED: Just put
a little weight behind it.
l'm sure you boys
can manage that.
PORKY: OK, get your shoulders
behind this thing.
BlLLY: Hey, listen up!

TlM: What's with him?
TOMMY: Take care of that.
What's wrong with you, Pee Wee?
PEE WEE: For God's sake,

That was my last chance.
Now l'm never gonna get laid.
TOMMY: Oh, no--Wendy!
Wendy! Come here.
WENDY:
Don't, Tommy. Don't make me!
TOMMY:
You said if we pulled it off...
you'd break Pee Wee's cherry.
-Turner.
-Turner.
TOMMY: A bet's a bet.
Now you gotta pay up.
WENDY: l should have gotten
better odds.
PEE WEE: What do you mean,
''break Pee Wee's cherry''?
TOMMY: Look, Pee Wee,
you want to get laid or not?
lf you're not cherry,
you don't get Wendy.
PEE WEE: l'm cherry!
l'm as cherry
as George Washington's tree.
You could put me on top

MlCKEY:
He's as cherry as they come!
TOMMY: Well?
WENDY: Well...
MlCKEY: Come on, baby!
