#This very little premature morning
#I went out of the common
people with the little herd,
#And as then dawn was coming
#I was receiving it
#Singing like a little bird
#This very little premature morning
#For the lanes of the brushwood,
#I am the hormiguita of the spoils
#And as he has very good eyes
#He spindles sometimes of the bunches.
#Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch,
#What work commands the Lord  to us!
TO RETURN
