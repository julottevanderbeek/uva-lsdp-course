Season 5, episode 2
#56 - Unlike A Virgin
Turtle:
are we seriously not
going out tonight?
- we seriously are not.
- come on, Vin.
- we need to go
find some girls.
- I got reading to do.
You've been reading all day.
Look at your fingertips.
They're all sunburned from
holding scripts over your face.
Give me a break, Turtle.
There's still plenty to go.
Sorry.
Drama!
You want to go
find some ass?
- hi, jaq.
- hey, Turtle.
- bye, Turtle.
- bye, jaq.
He's touchy.
Sorry again.
get to one good one.
- yeah?
- it's strong.
- put it on the pile.
- nice.  I like the new
work ethic, Vince.
I don't.
Oh, I do love those tits.
You want to roll
to the villa tonight, e?
Who, just me and you?
Yeah, you're right.
I'll just catch a beat.
What?
Not out here.
Drama:
we're heading into
Ari's office right now.
We'll be here for about 15
minutes then we'll go to lunch,
Probably urth caffe,
and then the gym.
Sportsclub, not gold's,
cause I did my lats yesterday.
I'll do a steam,
maybe a protein shake
And then I'll race home
just in time to tuck you in.
Don't you worry, babe.
Oh, I miss you.
Okay.
Tweet.
Bye.
What, do you tell her every
detail of your day, Drama?
Yup.  Jaqueline's
the real jealous type.
So I got to make sure all
my time is accounted for,
Otherwise
it's nag nag nag.
Sounds like
a good relationship.
You've had
a relationship, Turtle?
Ari:
look at this.
Like the good old days, huh?
Not quite.
I've read scripts.
- Eric: a lot of scripts.
- you boys are maturing
so nicely.
- Lloyd.
- thank you, Lloyd.
So, Vinnie, I need to
formally apologize
Face to face for this
"danger beach" thing.
- Ari, don't.
- I thought it was real.
- we both did.
- I don't care about that.
I'm here to move forward.
I'll do any one of
these scripts.
So he doesn't even have
to talk anymore?
- no, I'm gonna mime.
-
Look at this.
What have we got?
"jarvik," about the guy who
invented the artificial heart.
I sent it to you
when you were in colombia.
- never heard back from you.
- we were working.
So were they on
getting a lead actor.
And they got one,
toby maguire.
Leo's doing "the merchant
of venice beach."
Wahlberg's doing "milk bar."
"nine brave souls"--
Maser and baird.
I don't know what this is.
- I've never
heard of these guys.
- I found that one.
Did you jerk it out
of Turtle's cock?
Come on, Ari, it's cool.
Take a look.
"dear Vincent Chase's
manager.
After three years
of turmoil we have completed
What we think you'll find
to be a complex and riveting
tale of men
On a journey to save
themselves from a literalo "
Jesus Christ.
Have we learned nothing
from our past mistakes?
We need a go
film here, boys.
A studio film.
It's a great character piece.
It's about nine firefighters
On the night before the biggest
fire they ever fought.
No indies, e!
Think of it like
the holocaust.
Never again, all right?
That is what got us here
in the first place.
Vinnie, for the love of god,
this is not for us.
All right,
well what is for us?
- right now there is nothing.
- nothing?
Nothing.
You're in movie jail.
How do I get out?
What do I have to do?
You just do what
you've been doing.
- you just sit tight.
You wait.
- wait for what?
- for the stench from
"medellin" to disappear.
- how long's that gonna take?
How long did it take
for the air to clear
from fucking chernobyl?
What do you want us to do?
You want us to sit around
and do nothing?
I thought you
weren't gonna talk.
But since you are, yes.
You should sit around
and do nothing.
Or maybe go
to Vinnie's supersecret
hideaway in Mexico
And come back
when you're tan or tall,
whichever comes first.
- Ari.
- Vinnie, listen to me.
Listen.
We need to rebuild you.
All right?  We've got to
start over from scratch.
I will decide when
the moment is right.
And then we will pounce
on a greenlit studio picture
With an a-list director,
'cause that is what we need.
Listen, this is what I do.
Let me be heard this time.
I swear to god you will
come back stronger than ever.
Like lance armstrong,
But with two balls.
Hard to believe this
is where I'm at, huh?
Hard to believe
we're gonna sit around on
our asses and do nothing.
There are other things
an actor can do besides
waiting around for his agent.
Like what, Drama?
Somebody's got to hire
him to act.
Nobody hired Drama when he
was doing those scenes on
the 3rd street promenade.
I didn't do scenes
on the promenade, jerkoff.
The santa monica pier once,
and I got paid for that.
So what do you think
I can do, Johnny?
Well, you can work on
your body for one.
My body?
What's wrong
with my body?
Don't get sensitive, bro.
Let's face it,
you'd have a tough time
landing the lead in "300."
What do you think
of this, Turtle?
- I liked "300."
- you don't like
my body either?
Vin, your body is just fine.
But I have often thought
if we put your face on
russell crowe's body
We'd have the terminator
of acting.
You've thought about Vince's
face on russell crowe's body?
That's disturbing.
I'm actually feeling
insecure now.
- I wanted to talk to
you about that script.
- you heard Ari.
We need a studio movie.
We're gonna listen
to him this time.
I'm talking about the writers.
I'm thinking maybe I should
sign them.
Yeah, give you three out-
of-work clients to work with.
Sorry, Vin.
I'm really just making fun
of his other clients.
I actually think
it's a good idea.
Worst case,
- we'll have a nice management
business to feed us.
- exactly.
Don't look now,
but it's justine chapin.
Oh, maybe we can
get her to feed us.
- justine!
- Vince.
Hi!
How have you been?
How's life?
Life's amazing.
You?
sorry.
God, you look incredible.
You too.
What are you doing in town?
Shooting a video
for my new album.
New album.
That's awesome.
- can't wait to hear it.
- don't make fun.
I know my music
isn't really your thing.
But this is way different.
- it's very sophisticated.
- I'm sure.
I've grown up.
I'm doing duets
with tony bennett.
- I love tony bennett.
- he's amazing.
We're finishing the video
today and having a wrap party.
- you guys should come.
- I got a girlfriend.
You should come, Vince.
Well, I'm off today,
so why not?
Okay, I'll text you
the address.
- great.
- see you.
- yeah, bye.
- see you.
Fuck the gym.
My body's fine.
- aw, fuck!  What the--
- that's all right.
What's the matter
with you today, buddy?
Focus is off.
What's the problem?
You got marital woes?
No, client trouble.
You need me to hunt down
some commissions for you?
It's Vinnie Chase.
There are no commissions.
Oh, man.
Screened "medellin" last night.
Fell asleep halfway through.
Don't worry about Vinnie, Ari.
It's all good.
I'm making so much money
you're gonna be all right,
buddy.
Jesus, come on.
That's a nice shot.
I'm going again.
Hit until you're happy.
It's your club.
You know what?
I love this kid
the way I love you.
He comes into my office today,
he's got four scripts
That he wants to do,
none of which he can get.
I don't know what
to say to him.
You were always good
at lying off the cuff.
What are you talking about?
I never lied to you.
What about when
you told me you liked
"the truth about charlie"?
- what is "the truth
about charlie"?
- exactly.
- hit e ball, please.
- look where we are now, baby.
What about Vinnie?
Think he's gonna be all right?
Fucking rusty cunt bucket!
- fuck!
- I wasn't laughing.
- fuck!
-
-
-
Bullets and bitches,
l.B. Here.
I'm looking for
nick or lawrence.
L.B. Stands for
lawrence, hot dog.
Is there a problem?
No, my name is Eric murphy.
I'm a talent manager
from los angeles.
You guys sent me your script.
I'd love to talk to you
about it.
Please don't tell me this
is one of them prank shows.
We got guns here.
No prank, l.B.
I loved your script.
Holy fuck!
I'm freakin'!
I'm fuh-fuckin' freakin'.
Are you serious?
Oh, damn.
Vincent Chase wants
to do our movie.
No, actually I wanted
to talk to you guys about
representation.
I'd better get nick.
Look, how about I come out
there and see you guys?
All right.
Yeah, I guess.
I guess
that'd be all right.
How do you know she's not
a virgin anymore, Turtle?
It's been all over the papers.
Why do you think her last
few albums haven't sold?
I should not
be here right now.
You know I had a thing
for this girl back
in the day.
- but you never closed.
- I wasn't gonna be her first.
I know your motto,
never be the first,
never be the last.
Could you guys
just take me home?
- no.
- shut up.
- maybe I'll call a cab.
- what is the problem?
The problem is when I gave
jaq my itinerary
I didn't account on time
being spent with non-virgins.
It's almost 10:00 in France.
I'm supposed to be home
So I can tuck her in
on the computer.
If not, she's gonna freak.
Johnny, why do you want
to be in a relationship
with someone this crazy?
Obsession is a huge
turn on to me, bro.
You are so gonna
bang this girl.
She can be real trouble
for me, I'm telling you.
If you and Drama both
have girlfriends, I'm gonna
shoot myself.
I hope I have a girlfriend
after tonight.
I'm gonna go call her.
- hello.
- hey, babe.
Hello, Johnny.
Are you ready to video?
No, my stupid
internet's down.
Modern technology sucks.
Did you try
resetting the modem?
Yeah, like three times.
No go.
I'm sorry if I let you
down tonight.
You didn't let me down.
But I do like to see you.
I like to see
you too, baby.
Are you listening
to tony bennett?
Uh, yeah.
I was just playing some cds.
I love tony bennett.
Oh yeah?
So do I.
I didn't know you
loved tony bennett.
I guess we still have
some things left to uncover
about each other, huh?
Yeah, I guess so.
So let me try to
understand something.
You represent Vincent Chase,
you want to represent us,
We want Vincent Chase but you
can't get us Vincent Chase.
- well, Vince is looking to do
a studio movie right now.
- oh, he is?
- so what can you get us?
- I think I can get you
a job writing.
Why do we need a job when
we spent three years of our
lives writing the script?
Well, maybe if it's
a real writing job--
Yeah, l.B., wait.
Hold on for a second.
L.B. Gets a little excited
by the appearance
Of a fancy car
and nice clothes.
No offense.
This script has our life's
blood dripped into it.
As your manager, nick--
As the manager
of Vincent Chase
Who can't get us
Vincent Chase,
Who do you manage
that you can get for us?
You got shia labeouf?
Listen, managers don't
necessarily get you stars
for your movies, nick.
What I can do,
what I will do,
Is passionately sell you
guys to the town
So that people will
pay you lots of money
To do what you did
so well on this script.
I mean, let me do that.
Come on, guys.
What do I have to do to
prove to you that I'm the one
that can change your lives?
Sell the script--
"nine brave souls."
That's what you can do.
-
-
- just calm down.
- I can't calm down, Turtle.
I never should have
lied to her.
Jaq knows me too well.
It's like the tone of my voice
is her own truth serum.
Drama, you're not
doing anything wrong
so stop worrying about it.
I appreciate the advice,
Turtle, but you don't
understand crazy broads
'cause nobody's ever
been attracted enough
to you to act psycho.
I'm gonna call her back
and try and gauge her
temperature.
Good luck with that.
You guys have
an amazing chemistry.
Wow, this is like a mutual
admiration society.
- loved "aquaman."
- thank you.
I haven't got a chance
to see the suel yet.
Don't worry, I'm not in it.
Jake gyllenhaal is.
Well, I guess
you had your reasons.
Anyway, it was a pleasure
meeting you.
- thank you very much.
- thank you.
And, sweetheart,
I'll see you in a bit.
Okay.
- isn't he awesome?
- yeah, he is.
- I have someone else
I would like you to meet.
- oh yeah?
Yes.  See the pink
dress over there with
the incredible legs?
- yeah.
- she's so in love with you
and she's amazing.
- yeah?
- yeah.
I'm gonna go get her.
Be right back.
What's going on?
I'm t sure,
but I think I'm being
pawned off.
- get out of here.
- something very off
about today.
She's not answering.
I'm freaking out.
She must be pissed.
She must be sleeping.
I just talked to her
Baby jaq don't
fall asleep that fast.
Maybe she's on the can
taking a shit.
Yeah, let's hope so.
I'll call her back in 10.
Vince, michella.
Michella, Vince.
- y.
- hi.
So, justine, you have
any other spare friends
lying around for me?
E's on the phone.
Why?
I don't know,
but he sounds enthusiastic.
- what?
- jesus, be less friendly.
If you have business
to discuss, start talking, e.
I want to talk to you about
that script I found.
What did I tell you
this morning?
Relax, Ari.
I'm not calling about Vince.
- I want to sign the writers.
- why would I care?
Because I want to sell
their script.  I need an agent
to help me do that.
Try the yellow pages.
Come on, Ari.
I'm calling you as a friend,
all right?
I need your help.
It's a really good script.
Can you help me?
Yes I can, e.
Lloyd.
Get the number
for ucla extension
So Eric can take
a course to finally learn
how the movie business works.
- you won't help me, Ari?
- we share one client, e.
We're never gonna
share two.
Here you go.
So how long have you
been a dancer?
Since I was three.
So like 19 years.
I thought you said
you were 27.
So?
Still no answer.
I don't know what to do.
- keep trying.
- who's not answering?
My girlfriend.
She's pissed at me.
- why, what did you do?
- I lied to her.
I said I was home
when I was at a party.
But she has no way
of knowing that he lied.
But it's night in paris
and she's not answering
Her phone
so he's freaking out.
This is unreal.
And it's her fault.
Because if she wasn't
so fucking possessive
I wouldn't have to lie to her.
- maybe she's sleeping.
- that's what I said.
Well, you're both wrong
'cause the ring would have
woke her up.
So either she's pissed
and not answering
Or she's being held captive.
There's a third choice.
- what's that?
- she's out.
- out where?
- maybe a party.
You are.
You think my girl
would lie to me?
I told my boyfriend I was
at an audition today.
He gets really upset
when I'm out.
I'm calling her back.
So with all that dancing,
Can you do any crazy shit
like put your legs behind
you head?
I told you
I have a boyfriend.
You did.
But you also said
you lie to him.
So maybe you could tell him
that we didn't fuck today.
Baby, it's me again.
I'd like to think
you're sleeping,
But nobody could
sleep through this.
where the fuck are you?!
Pick up the fucking phone!
Didn't his mother ever tell
him not to speak like that?
I remember the first time
you and justine went out.
- I was still living in ohio
and I was so jealous.
- oh yeah?
I've had a crush on you
since you did that
mentos commercial.
Oh, wow, that was
a long time ago, huh?
I should get
some extra credit
For liking you even before
you were a giant movie star.
Yes, you should.
Uh, listen, michelle,
Would you excuse me
for a second?
I just have to make
a quick phone call.
- yeah, sure.
But, Vince.
- yeah?
- it's michella.
- oh.
But you can call me michelle
if you like that better.
I'll be right back.
Hey, Lloyd, is Ari there?
I need to talk to him.
Ari's in a screening right now.
Is everything okay?
Actually, no it's not.
Can you get him out?
Tell him I'll be
there in 10 minutes.
I really need to talk.
Vince is gonna be here
in 10 minutes.
Jesus!
What do you want to do?
I can't walk out of here
'cause the director is
sitting right behind me.
So what should I do?
Pull the plug
on the projector.
- are you serious?
- yeah, go.
What the hell?
Can we fix this fucking
projector already?
I'm sorry, man.
I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna hit
the bathroom real quick.
Could someone fix
the fucking projector?
- so what did he say
the problem is?
- he didn't.
But if I had to guess
I'd say you didn't make
him very happy this morning.
Like it's my fault.
- you calling to apologize?
- I'm calling to tell you
That I blame you
for every bad thing that's
ever happened to Vince,
And every bad thing
that ever could happen to him
for the rest of his life.
You're the unfucking
lucky charm.  You hear me?
You should never utter
the words "I've found
a good script"
'cause you have no idea
what a good fucking script
looks like.
Live with that.
Mr. Murphy,
miss daniels will see you now.
Thank you.
Well, this is a surprise.
How could you
do this to me?
Six months I've been
nothing but faithful.
Do you have any idea
how much pussy is thrown
at me day and night?
And I pass on all of it.
For what?
So you could run around
fucking every french faggot
That pays you a compliment?
- Johnny?
- baby?
Where the fuck
have you been?
I was at the hospital.
My friend had a car accident.
- what friend?
- lily.
Hi, Johnny.
Oh, hey, lily.
- how are you doing?
- I've been better.  You?
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Jaq, are you okay?
No, Johnny,
I'm not okay.
I knew you were a little
crazy when you said
We needed to get on
the computer every night,
But I had to call the police
on my last boyfriend.
- look, baby--
- I don't want to have
to call the police on you.
- goodbye, Johnny.
- wait wait wait wait!
Wait, jaq!
Jaq!
Baby.
So why aren't you keeping
this for Vince?
Ari only wants Vince
to do a go studio movie.
- do you agree?
- yeah.
I mean, if he can get one.
What do you think?
I think we don't work
together anymore, Eric.
But if this script is
as good as you say it is
Seems like Vince
could use it.
On the other hand,
you are one more bad choice
away from ruining his career.
Thanks.
So did Ari read it?
Nope.
So what makes you
think I will?
You have a better work ethic.
Look at that.
See?  You almost smiled.
Now look,
it's really good.
I promise you I wouldn't waste
your time if it wasn't.
Just read 10 pages
of it and you'll be
hooked, guaranteed.
- please.
- leave it, I'll read five.
He's here.  He's here.
Vince is here.
What, are you speedballing
fairy dust?
Go out there
and greet him like a man.
Vinnie.  There he is.
How you doing, baby?
To be honest, Ari,
not great.
I haven't said that
very many times in my life.
- what's wrong?
- I don't know.
I came back from Mexico
motivated, ready to work
And correct me if I'm wrong,
you basically said that I can't.
- no no no, what I said was--
- I know what you said.
I just want to know
what it means.
Do you really have
a plan, Ari?  Really?
You always said you were
going to be the guy to give
it to me straight, so come on.
Give it to me straight.
Am I gonna be okay?
I don't know.
I mean, one bad movie
and this is what happens?
I mean, was I really
that awful?
Straight up, Vinnie,
the movie was awful.
And yes,
you were awful in it.
But you know what?
One bad movie can be overcome.
Look at colin farrell.
He's overcome dozens of them
Because the perception of him
is he's a movie star.
- and what's
the perception of me?
- that you don't give a fuck.
You refuse to play the game.
You refuse to be a part
of the process.
Look, the great ones,
even if they don't care,
They pretend they do.
Do you think
I'm a good actor, Ari?
I did not sign you
in the first place 'cause
I thought you could act.
I signed you because I thought
you were a movie star.
And you haven't acted
like one in a long time.
I'm ready to play
the game, Ari.
Whatever you say.
- that's a good start.
- but I'm not willing to wait.
I want you to send me
in to every person
In this town who's
willing to meet me.
I don't care
if it wastes my time,
I will charm the fuck
out of every last one of them.
Filmmakers,
studio execs
All of them,
I will change the perception.
I like the fire.
You don't believe
I'm a good actor?
It remains to be seen.
But, Vin, I'm starting
to believe
That you're
a movie star again.
And you know what?
This town loves a comeback.
And since britney
fucked hers up,
It's all you!
Photographer:
hey, Vinnie, over here.
- yo, Vin, we're leaving.
- give me two minutes.
I'll be right back.
Where did you go?
I've been waiting.
I'm sorri'll be right b.
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you
for a second?
- where are you going?
- Vince, what?
Why did you invite me here
if you were just going to
pawn me off on your friend?
- I thought you'd like her.
- I like you.
Vince, if I fuck you
Then I'll want to be
your girlfriend.
And I don't want to be in
a relationship right now.
So last time I saw you,
you were too innocent.
Now you're too slutty?
- now I'm having fun.
- so we'll have fun.
Keep it casual.
Get serious in the future.
And if we fuck up any chance
of having a future?
I'll risk it if you will.
How long are we just gonna
sit here for?
Till Vince comes out.
Well, I'm getting
really bored
And it's giving me
time to think.
It's not a good thing
for you.
I understand.
And try not to take
this as an insult,
But as gorgeous as you are,
I'd never ditch Vince for you.
Well, I like your loyalty.
Yeah?
How much?
Jesus Christ, Drama.
Where the hell have you been?
I've been drinking.
You okay?
Do I look okay?
- there's Vince.
- well, look at this.
Let's roll.
- hey, Johnny.
- hey.
You guys really kind of
like each other, huh?
Uh, maybe.
That's great.
That's just fucking great.
