Mama, it's so cold.
It's very, very cold, Will.
Put another log on the fire, lad.
There isn't any more firewood, Mama.
Don't worry, Ma.
Jake'll be back soon.
He'll have money for a doctor.
- Did you sell the cow?
- You'll never believe it.
- How much did you get?
- I met a stranger on the road.
Beans?
Magic beans.
- Oh, Jacob.
- Beans?!
He said that they'd make Lotte better
and we'd live happily ever after.
And you believed it? You believed it?!
You idiot! You idiot, Jake!
- She's gonna die because of you!
- Boys, think of your poor sister!
Where do you come from, mein Herr?
Kassel, near Frankfurt.
Monsieur, we're looking
for food and lodging.
A little something, sir?
Help an old soldier. Help an old soldier, sir.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, sir.
God bless you, sir.
God bless you.
Ah!
Oh, God bless you.
- Groom your horses for half a franc.
- Do you know the mayor of this town?
Only groom for the best, sir.
Then give him this.
The Brothers Grimm?
Every second counts.
The witch comes in the dead
of night, when the moon is well-hid.
She comes out of
the darkest, coldest blackness.
Her cry would freeze
the very blood in your veins.
You were right to send for us.
- How many here have seen her?
- Everyone who lives by the mill stream.
It was a hundred years ago. The miller's
wife was burned at the stake for witchcraft,
and they tossed her charred bones
into the river.
Her remains should have been
sealed in a mirror-lined box.
Well, for nights thereafter children saw her
walk the riverbank, beckoning them to her.
- Many did. The mill witch of Karlstadt.
- Yes. We know the legend.
- Then you believe us?
- I'd believe anything you choose to tell me.
Come to my mill.
Such ungodly horrors!
Such banshees screeching.
And if you dare set eyes upon...
Shut up!
Give him his medicine.
Brothers Grimm, we're at our wit's end.
What can you do for us?
It's difficult. Jake?
When you burn a witch,
her soul burns eternally,
so the exorcism of witches
requires a very special method.
- And expensive.
- Only an arrow of innocent tears,
that is child's tears, shot directly
through the heart can put out that fire.
That's the theory.
This is no ordinary witch.
But we've got no one else to turn to.
Can't you help us?
How much?
- You're doing the right thing.
- I hope so.
Whatever happens,
stay behind that shield.
The armor was forged by Prince Richard
the Charming, who awoke Brier-Rose.
- Thank you.
- It reflects the powers of evil.
- Most of the time.
- Right.
- Surprise is critical.
- She mustn't detect us until we're...
...ready for her.
- Hold that.
- Positions.
- Will?
- Ready.
Three, two, one.
Huh?
She's trying to bring the whole place down.
Run!
Take a shot, Jake!
She's here!
She's here! She's here!
- I can't see the heart, Will.
- Lucifer!
Get ahold of yourself, man.
The Brothers Grimm do not fear you.
Reload, Jake.
Don't look her in the eyes.
- Shoot, Jake.
- Something's wrong.
Hit her in the heart.
- It won't release!
- Don't look in her eyes.
- What?
- Not the eyes.
She's got control over it, Will.
- Fight her, Jacob.
- I can't, Will!
We're brothers, dammit.
Be a Grimm and fight.
We've killed worse than you!
Argh!
Down! Down!
Down! Down! Down!
Stay back.
Back. She's trying to escape.
All souls take corporeal forms,
and when they fail they find places to hide.
Seal these in a mirror-lined box
and bury them far from any river,
and your witch will be gone for good.
You're a brave man.
Take the bag.
Bless you, brothers.
Bless you.
Whoa. We had
a legally binding agreement.
Oh, yes. Yes.
Of course.
Thank you. Thank you.
She... She is dead?
- Yeah, very.
- Course she is.
She's dead.
I must tell the whole town.
She's dead.
Our witch is dead!
That one was a bit of a nightmare.
Don't give me that look.
- I was a scholar once, Will.
- Yeah, now you're famous.
All the girls know your name.
What do you want? An apology?
Blithering idiot!
Your mother was a toothless cow!
Get me down.
Get me down!
Sorry, Hidlick. Slipped.
Fat Christ! What are you doing?
Trying to kill us?
Weren't we supposed to?
God-awful smoke!
You know, just once...
Just once, I'd like to sell it
on the strength of my performance.
Bunst.
Watch out for the...
snap boards.
We do all the flying, the burning, the
scaring, what do we have to show for it?
Talk to Will.
- One tenth. Just like God.
- Exactly, one tenth.
And for the rest, all you have to do
is ride into town and smile.
Yes, well, talk to Napoleon.
Organize your labor, start a guild.
There are two of us. Hm?
Two times ten. Hm?
- We want a twentieth.
- A twentieth?
Each.
Done.
Shrewd thespians.
Now, here's the plan.
Have a couple of days' rest
then meet us in Hamburg.
- Jake knows a legend of a bridge troll.
- Bridge troll. Yes!
How comes he does the monsters,
I play the girlie ghosts?
Because you, my friend, have talent.
You've got range.
What do I have, Will?
You, my handsome friend, have heart.
You, bro, have enough bullshit
to fill the palace of Versailles.
Right. You want the truth of it, boys?
It's a short, brutish struggle, then you die.
Life's little subterfuges
make it all worthwhile.
Well...
Your half, Professor.
Oh.
Would you prefer this in magic beans?
I'll take the beans, thanks, Will.
Stupid!
Who's there?
Hey!
Can you hear me?
Where are you?
Yes, we stood together.
Honestly.
And you were very, very brave,
weren't you?
Who's a brave miller?
You are.
Drink up, dear boy.
Will Grimm. Shall we?
Nothing comes between us brothers.
Not wicked witches.
No. And not vicious beasts in disguise.
And not murderous queens.
No.
Not even Godfather Death.
Because only the truest of truthful love
could ever beat the Grim Reaper.
- Isn't that right, Will?
- Absolutely!
The Grim Reaper!
Oh, I've got a story, I've got a story.
Shush. Shush.
Once upon a time there was an imp
whose name we had to guess.
We had to go right down to
the flaming belly of hell to find out.
But we did it. We did it!
I can tell you what. This business is quite
a lucrative one. Know what I mean?
There is definitely money
to be made in witches.
Jake!
- He can't hold his ale.
- I can't hold my ale!
German pigs!
Bloody French.
Oh, kiss a froggie
and he'll turn into a prince.
Stop it, Jake.
Stop it. You're drunk.
Shut up.
Hello.
Something full-blooded.
Perhaps a gorgeous
Châteauneuf-du-Pape.
Come on. 1792.
A very good year.
On the house.
Oh, no. Don't be too hasty, my friend.
Better to let something like that breathe.
That's the weak piss
Hans brews in the basement.
Nice one. Nice one. So... Ow!
Well, the music seems
to have turned horribly French.
Shall we continue
our little philosophical discussion upstairs?
What do you say, Jake?
A little chit, a little chat.
A little huff, a little puff,
thank you very much, Will.
There he goes.
Mythical damsels and princesses
are all he's really concerned with.
Very well, then. Magic awaits.
I know, we can play my favorite game.
It's called Who's the Fairest of Them All?
Beans, Jake. Beans.
Beans!
Ah, you're an idiot!
Wait for me, now, ladies.
I'm coming. I'm coming.
Beans.
Will, they're magic beans.
No, they're magic beans, Will.
And the giants will crush you
and rip out your heart.
Shh!
Grimm!
Ik, ik, ak, ek, ek.
- What's going on?
- How can you speak in this language?
Every word is like an execution.
Your horses are ready.
You've got a rope
tied around your foot.
- Run!
- Will! Will, wait!
- Never fear, Jake.
- Will!
Will!
I shall return for you.
Nice try.
Hey, hey! Heagh!
Signore, with bounteous pleasure,
I, Mercurio Cavaldi, present to you
the renowned, the legendary,
the General Vavarin Delatombe,
the military commander of the kingdom
of Westphalia, formerly known as...
- No, no, no.
... Hesse.
Exactly what am I enduring here?
Can someone please tell me
who gave birth to this?
It's Bavarian blood sausage,
with sauerkraut.
I gutted the pig myself.
- I bet you did.
- Grimmy,
you are to have to stand trial
for subterfuge, theft,
and buggery.
I'm sorry?
For which the minimum sentence is...
- Death.
- Oh, no, no. Hang on.
- That's absolutely unnecessary.
- There's been a mistake here.
These country people, they believe things.
We do this just to test them for science.
- Stop. Stop it.
- Ow.
No, no, no.
Are those... snails?
- Snails.
- Your friends have told us everything.
Everything except one thing.
Where are the children of Marbaden?
- What children?
- Nine cute little  gone! Vanished.
- We've never been to Marbaden.
- No.
Open up the cauldron.
- No, no. Wait, no!
- Wait, wait!
- I haven't done anything. Please.
- Please!
- By my honor I swear. I swear!
- We didn't do it!
Of course you didn't.
We have been observing you
for some time.
Cavaldi, stop.
Huh?
Please.
No, he said stop it!
However, someone in Marbaden
is working as you.
Same talents, same tricks.
It is a thorn in my toe.
You pull it out,
I might be persuaded to offer you amnesty.
So you mean, if we work for you...
- That's right, Jacob.
... French?
Go to Marbaden.
Unmask these villains.
Find the missing children.
Hans, we have to stay
where we can still see the village.
Not if we're going to find the missing girls.
We're going too far.
Greta, nothing has ever happened
to anyone in daytime.
And in the very middle of the wood
was the witch's gingerbread house.
Hans!
Hey! Come back!
Got ya!
Greta! Greta!
Lieutenant, keep your eyes open.
Sergeant, they are mine.
You go and sell
your oil of snake, Grimmy.
Good people of M... Agh!
It was a long trip.
People of Marbaden.
Hello. Anyone there?
Anybody there?
Say, brother.
Why don't you have a look round? Make
sure there's no French soldiers anywhere.
We wouldn't want to run into any French...
Oh. Hey, morning. Hello.
Will, there's a...
Ah. Morning.
- What..?
- Hello.
Who are you?
- Allow me.
- Uh...
Grimm is the name. Two s.
We are the Brothers Grimm.
- They don't know who we are.
- Stand aside, Gregor.
I'll deal with this.
What's your business?
We're here to save your land
from evil enchantments.
Too late.
The old ways have returned.
You handle it, Jake.
Uh...
Well, we're from Kassel, near Frankfurt.
- We've heard about your missing children.
- Food for trolls.
Hold your tongue, you old witch,
or you'll get another ducking.
Papa, Papa!
They can help us.
Stay back.
It's all right. They're the Brothers Grimm.
People talk about them in Malsburg.
Right you are, son.
The famous Brothers Grimm.
Look at this strapping young lad.
"He" is my daughter.
And a fine wife he'll make some lucky man.
- They kill trolls and giants, Papa.
- That's right. Of course we do, darling.
Jake, me...
the team.
Team Grimm at your service.
We were trying to find
and rescue the others.
Greta was afraid. She thought there really
was a witch in the gingerbread house.
Then birds stole our trail of crumbs.
It was a trap.
The forest made it.
Yes. Yes, it took my daughter too.
- Mine too.
- And mine.
- Ten girls are missing.
- Trees themselves set upon her.
Up and snatched her away.
Just left her little riding cape.
Like a wolf.
And when my daughter ran, it took flight.
Do you understand?
It flew!
Flying beast.
Rope pulley. Snap boards.
Fishing line. Wolf pelt. It's expensive.
Our people always knew
that the forest was enchanted.
But it's never turned against us.
- Until now.
- Until the French occupation.
And it's all
the fault of the French!
Good citizens,
you have nothing further to fear.
The Brothers Grimm are with you now.
Your salvation is at hand.
Now, we need a guide.
Someone who knows the forest.
- There is one.
- Who?
- Who?
- Who?
- The trapper.
- The cursed one.
Perfect.
Excuse me, Herr Krauss?
Um...
Hello, there. We've come
to help find the missing children.
We'll only need a few hours of your time.
Oh.
Sorry. Is your father here?
Husband?
Is there a man of any..?
Cursed.
Miss Krauss, perhaps you don't realize
who we are. We're the Brothers Grimm.
We vanquished the mill witch of Karlstadt,
the frog boy of Glutenhof,
and the cannibal chef of the Schwarzwald
in the gingerbread house of terror.
Miss, we need a guide, someone
who knows the paths through the forest.
We'll pay you money.
Well, beads and... pretty shiny things
from the big city.
Oh...
Miss, we believe your village
may be under some kind of curse.
Think I care about the village?
But he was trying to run away.
Are you aware that ten girls in this village
have gone missing?
Two of those girls were my sisters.
If your sisters are lucky sisters,
they are dead sisters.
Who's your friend?
- Um...
- I?
Who am I?
I am Mercurio Cavaldi,
of the great Cavaldis of Parma,
the master of the torturing arts.
Steady, Cavaldi.
We need her warm and breathing.
Good people of Marbaden,
your daughters will be returned.
And you shall regain
your courage and your joy.
To the forest!
Hah! Hah!
Cursed!
I don't know if I mentioned it,
but my name's Will.
That's my brother Jake.
I don't know if I mentioned it,
but my name's Will.
- That's my brother...
- Angelika.
Lovely.
Whatever trickster we're hunting -
and by "trickster" of course I mean
"demon" - he's got to have a hideout.
He's got to have a base of operations.
For example, these caves here.
Nothing there.
Just animal bones and old drawings.
Nine times out of ten,
there's a human perpetrator.
Apparently we're on foot from here.
Why?
Why we go this way?
Why?
Because even the animals
would never come this way.
- No weapons?
- Weapons, uh...
We keep the weapons.
We work with other tools, Angelika.
Don't be afraid.
I know this sophisticated technology
must look very strange to you.
- What exactly is it meant to do?
- Shh!
Right.
I feel it's safe to proceed.
You understand,
this really is exciting for us.
Our folk tales
sprang from places just like this.
I mean, it's funny, everywhere you look
you can feel the forest's ancient power.
I mean... Ough!
I mean, to our ancestors
this place was sacred.
Till the Christians invaded.
Now it's just territory.
Territory?
Oh. Oh!
Heavens above!
Will. Will, look at this.
- So the Christian king built all this?
- In the middle of the forest?
They cut it down.
It grew back.
I thought you said
the animals don't come here.
The animals don't drink from the spring.
I mean...
Urgh!
Are you feeling it, Will? I sense, so far,
dread. It's almost like a smell.
Of death.
Excuse me. Sorry.
You're not afraid, are you?
Not like the villagers.
Ah, so, um...
What happened here?
The Christian king
destroyed the forest people.
Burnt them to death in the caves.
What an awful story.
They were the lucky ones.
A year later the plague came.
Jake, we really should search the tower.
There's no way in.
Never was.
Angelika.
Look. You see that window?
Way, way up high.
Many centuries ago,
that's where the queen lived.
.
.
.
When she first fell sick and
her gorgeous flesh began to rot away,
they say you could hear her screams
across the oceans.
My princess isn't afraid, is she?
It's just an old story.
Papa's here to protect you.
Oh, yeah. Now, that's good. Uh-huh.
. By Ja...
Hm.
by Jac...
Mm-hm. Hm.
By Jacob Grimm.
Will.
Will. Will!
Argh! Ha!
Oh!
I'll kill you and take your eggs
and smash them all in and...
Spooky, spooky, spooky.
I'm afraid my instruments
aren't detecting much.
Let's call it a day before it gets,
you know, too dark.
- We should leave.
- Angelika.
Excuse me, uh...
- We came from that direction.
- That's not the way.
We walked right past those birds' trees.
- It's this way.
- That's the way we are walking out.
Don't trust the trees.
Hello, Grandmother Toad.
- Show us the path.
- Oh, God.
Show us the way and I'll give you a kiss.
Oh, my, that's just not right.
Sh, sh, sh.
That way.
You're sure, Grandmother?
As I thought.
- Yeah, right.
- You don't believe me?
Well...
Taste for yourself.
- We did not come this way.
- What's her game?
I don't think she's putting it on, Will.
There was some kind of
presence back there.
Oh, shut up, Jacob!
Did you fall for this spooky dance number?
You mooncalf.
Mooncalf?
She is up to something. I don't trust her.
I'd slip her the goldfish but I...
And here we are.
Nicely done, Angelika.
Knew you'd find it.
Hey, hey.
Here, boy. Whoa.
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.
Calm down.
Oh.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Whoa.
Fruitful expedition. Many things
learned. Many things learned indeed.
Won't be long now.
Sasha.
Shall we regroup at dawn tomorrow?
Give you boys enough time
for your beauty sleep.
- You're on your own tomorrow.
- Sorry. What?
I said, you're on your own tomorrow.
- What's she say?
- She said we're on our own.
You forced me to show you the forest.
I showed you the forest.
It's all right.
I'll handle this one.
Would you hitch my horse, Will?
Are you all right?
Can I come in?
These drawings are very good, you know.
I do a bit of drawing myself.
I'm not bad.
Angelika,
there was power in that place,
wasn't there? The tower.
Father used to take us there.
And where is he now?
- He died.
- Oh.
Last winter.
They say the wolves took him.
The wolves?
Look, if you won't guide us,
would you at least give us a map?
- A map wouldn't do you any good.
- A lot more good than it would do you.
At least we can read.
Come on, Jake.
You people think you know everything.
I've been to the city.
My father saved every penny he earned
to buy me a proper education.
Ah, money down the drain, if you ask me.
You're right.
After he died, my sisters were left alone.
They were the first to be taken.
That's why they call you cursed.
Yeah.
So tell me again, famous Brother Grimm,
how exactly do you intend to save us?
I think I'll do my own searching.
I thought that went rather well.
Gift. For surprise.
For you. Tasty.
Argh!
Such German hospitality.
The Brothers Grimm will thank you
for your kindness.
Oh!
I'm starving.
No, no, no, no, no.
Not for you, my little Cinderellas.
Help me.
There, there.
It's all right.
What a pretty horse you are.
Such big eyes you have.
And big ears you have.
And such a pretty, pretty mouth.
Ugh!
Sorry.
Huh? Where'd that come from?
Ho, hey!
Easy, easy.
Steady, easy.
- Elsie!
- Help!
They could mechanize the horse,
put it on tracks.
- There were no tracks.
- Get out of the way.
Angelika.
- What about mirrors?
- Elsie!
You use a real animal
and a warped mirror.
That as my horse.
That was Pepper.
What is happening?
- I should catch that horse.
- Grimmy?
- You're wearing a bonnet.
- So are you.
Heagh! Heagh!
Heagh!
Faster! Faster, Will.
Dax, Letorc,
don't lose sight of the Grimmy.
Go on. Kick him, kick him, Will!
Ugh!
Tripwires!
There's someone in the woods.
Watch out!
- Will, are you seeing what I'm seeing?
- I most definitely am not.
They've put the woods on wheels.
- Those trees on tracks.
- Will...
Pulley system. Expensive.
Control your horses.
Don't lose sight of the Grimmy.
Go, go.
I've been looking for you.
Stralda, what's happening?
Gie, gie, gie!
You can see they're on tracks.
- Show yourselves!
- There, there, there!
Can you hear me?
What is this, Grimms?
What is happening?
These people are
much better funded than we are.
Get down! Get down.
Wait!
Stop, Will.
Help me!
Help!
Run! Run!
His eyes.
His eyes.
My hair.
Letorc?
Dax?
Can you hear my voice?
I command you, fall in.
How many times do I have to tell you?
There you go. Can't breathe.
This is so incredible.
This changes everything.
Gotta write this down. That was real.
Beans, Jake. Magic beans. There is
a rational explanation for all of this.
What do you mean?
Rational explanation? The bugs were...
And the forest was sweeping down on us.
Stop it, Jake!
- It was like everything was under a spell.
- Or curse.
- What?
- My whole family's cursed.
My father...
Father...
- What about your father?
- I have to go back.
Angelika...
On the ground.
On the ground,
Go down, now!
On the ground.
Now, who killed my men, huh?
You tell me, Grimmy.
Who? Or she will die.
It was the forest.
German peasant.
And if you stay it will destroy you too.
.
The emperor honors me with a visit
from you, his most trusted advisors.
I salute you.
Your shining examples illuminate
this dark German forest of ignorance and...
Ah!
Finally, finally!
General... Ah!
General, your soldiers...
They are dead.
I'm lucky survived. See?
Here, just this little wound.
Just a little, little itchy scratch.
We begin with lobster bisque.
Ah!
You embarrass me.
You ridicule me!
You insult me in front of my guests.
These people are Parisians.
No, no! Argh!
They tried to blind Cavaldi
with their fairy tales
and devouring trees and flying wolves.
But I use my logical brain, Generale.
I can make this as clear as crystal.
I am in no way responsible.
It is them.
They are the ones.
The Grimmy!
The plan is very simple.
They use the little girls as bait,
they lure your soldiers
into the forest, and, uh...
- Bingo.
- Bingo?
Yes. Shh.
It's bingo.
General, we are outmaneuvered,
outflanked, outnumbered
by some German force
which threatens your superiorit...
Grimms.
What precisely happened in the forest?
General, I believe we witnessed
a case of authenticated enchantment.
We're not saying that.
That is not our official position.
But it's true.
Kill them.
I will deal with you later.
No, monsieur.
Don't kill.
I can make them speak.
Huh?
Wait! No! Stop!
No, no, no, no, no!
This is nothing to do with me.
He forced...
- She's innocent. Let her go.
- Stop!
General, you keep working with Cavaldi,
this country won't be yours much longer.
- He panics.
- The great Cavaldi never panics.
Uh...
Hm.
- Stop!
- General!
Cavaldi was right.
Cavaldi was right.
We saw them. We did.
There was three in the trees,
two in the caves.
Huge men. With weapons.
My masterpiece is working.
Truth comes out.
These are backward people. They cling to
folklore because it gives them strength.
Stop. You're giving them what they want.
The longer this goes on,
the more Germans will talk like her.
- Then arm themselves, organize...
- Then the problem won't be just a forest.
- It shall be a nation!
- Yes!
- Let us do it our way.
- Yes!
- Send us back into the forest.
- Ye... What?
We'll lie in wait
with our men, our equipment.
- No, no...
- General, trust me.
Let us rig a surprise for them.
Cavaldi, stop.
- Huh?
- Stop!
Very well, Grimms.
You shall return to the forest.
But I warn you,
attempt to escape
and I shall raze every tree,
demolish every building,
slaughter every innocent in search of you.
You understand?
Mind his head.
Pack the horses with as much gear
as they can carry, all right?
I'm a little unclear
as to who exactly we're up against.
Just stay close to your horse.
Jake. Jake.
- Listen.
- What?
Go and get back on your horse.
- We're gonna make a run for it.
- I remember the rest of the story.
What are you talking about?
- It's an ancient folklore, passed down...
- Jake!
The tower, the queen, her story, it's...
- Before the plague...
- Jacob.
...the queen killed all the villagers'
ancestors to get her hands on their spells.
- And one was a spell for eternal life.
- Give me that stupid book!
- She's still in the tower. She's there now.
- Jake.
