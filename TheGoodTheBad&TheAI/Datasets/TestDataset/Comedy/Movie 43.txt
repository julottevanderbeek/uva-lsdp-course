- Good. Are you on?
- Yeah, we're ready.
What you're about to witness
is the most badass,
Oh, yeah.
Don't try this at home.
You're good? You ready, buddy?
All right. Right, ready?
Did we? No! No way, we got it!
No fucking way, dude!
We got it! We got it! We got...
- Oh, shit!
Look at that! Look at that!
Dude. Bull's eye, bro!
We're putting it on You Tube!
Let's go! Yeah!
Yeah, buddy, that was us
when we uploaded it.
Well, then upload it again
so we can have two views.
- Hit "refresh," dude.
- Oh, yeah.
- No way.
- That can't be right.
- Do me a favour.
- I just refreshed it.
No way. Twenty-five thousand
views, man!
- One million? Yes!
- You're too money!
- I told you we're going to be famous.
- We're going to be famous and...
I took the liberty of cloning You Tube
and hyper-inflating your Views.
Did you just try to hit me
through your computer screen?
Why don't you come in here so
I can hit you like a real man, pussy!
Working on my science project.
Enjoy your page Views.
- We need revenge.
- We do.
- We need to April fools prank him.
- Yeah!
- Hit him where it hurts.
- Square in his balls.
No! We got to do
something better.
We steal his computer
and load it full of viruses.
- Wait, where do we get viruses?
- Uh, duh! Porn sites.
Hy do you think my computer's
so slow? Lt's full of 'em.
Oh, okay, but how-how do we get
his laptop if it's in his room?
We can't just-just kick
in the door and steal it.
How do you lure a dragon
out of a lion's den?
- You present him with a challenge.
- Challenge?
- Baxter! Baxter, my man!
- What?
Uh, me and J.J., we have
this computer problem.
There's this movie on
the Internet and we can't find it.
You're trying to get back
at me for that prank, right?
No! Truce! Truce.
Seriously, we just, uh...
we need to find it, uh,
before the FBI takes it down.
- Fucking FBI, the CIA...
- The CSI, NCIS...
it has been banned
by every country in the world.
Where you could slap a cop
in the face with your penis,
- Amsterdam's not a country?
- Since when?
Yeah. Think about it. They... it’s-
It's like it's the-the-the fucking...
It's the most dangerous
film in the world.
- It is.
- What's it called?
Actually, you know what,
Baxter? You're right.
go on with your life and never
think about this again. Please.
- What's so bad about it?
- You don't want to know.
Hey, slim!
What's so bad about it?
- It can kill you.
- How?
Lt can make you shit out
your intestines.
It can make you bleed
out of your eyes.
and he ran into a church, and
he just started humping the nuns.
That was a huge story
a few years back.
It can make you pull off
your own dick.
Okay, why would you
want to watch it...
if it can make you pull off
your own dick?
if you can watch it all the way
through from the beginning to end,
you're rewarded beyond
your wildest dreams.
With money. And sex.
And women.
It's like that movie The Ring,
but with a good ending.
- Yeah. And boobs.
- Lots of boobs.
- Forty-three.
- Movie forty-three.
Yeah, of course it's not
on Zwoogle. It's banned!
Okay. Then I guess
we'll need to dig deeper.
Visit some dark corners
of the Internet.
Mm, yeah, the dark
corners, dude.
Yeah, get in there.
We got to find this thing.
I found a cloaked server
that houses banned videos.
Start out with the forty-third one
on the list. Sound good?
Yes! Yeah, you guys keep
working on this.
I'm going to go guard the door
for the uh, FBI,
Hope you're almost ready.
He's going to be here any second.
I don't know why I'm doing this,
Pam. I don't trust Julie.
- I mean, what if this guy's a loser?
- He's not a loser.
He made senior partner at his law
firm by the time he was,
So all he cares about is
his career and money.
Mm, not according to Julie. He's a
volunteer with the Special Olympics,
he's on the board of
the New York Philharmonic...
He's opening a new restaurant
with Derek Jeter!
But he's probably got one of those
awkward character faces...
that sort of really has
to grow on you, right?
Mr. "Character Face" is on
the cover of Gotham Magazine.
- That's him?
- That's him.
- Do I look okay?
- Gorgeous.
- You sure?
- Have fun!
- I mean, you got to be kidding.
- Several of them.
I'm telling you, don't knock
shopping on TV until you've tried it.
Beth, I think-I think you're
the first person I've ever met...
who actually buys
stuff off television.
- No! Come on!
- No, it's true.
Oh, well where do you think
I got this scarf?
And you know what?
I bet it's softer than yours.
Okay. See, that's where
I draw the line.
Here. Feel this. One-hundred
percent pashmina.
Well, at least that's what
the guy on the street told me.
Come on, then. Wow, that is soft.
Well, you know, l...
- L'll take those.
- Thank you.
- Please.
- Our table's ready.
So, um, Carrie tells me you design
clothes for kids. No?
So, if I see some kids looking weird
this summer, it may be your fault, huh?
Eh... Yeah, you good with that? Or would
you prefer a glass of wine or?
So, here's to a, Here's to
a wonderful evening. Cheers.
Oh, it's great. This pl...
Oh, you got to check out the ceiling.
of this old Quaker meetinghouse
out in rural Pennsylvania.
I mean, look. It's all oak. Isn't
that something? Lt's gorgeous, huh?
Well, Mr. H, this is a vichyssoise
courtesy of Chef Billy.
Now, he heard that you guys
were coming in tonight,
so he's put together a special
four-course meal for you.
That's okay with me
if it's okay with you,
un-unless you want to
check out the menu.
Beth? Unless you want to
check out the menu, or?
- No, that's sounds lovely.
- Right.
Please thank the chef.
Thank you.
Something on my neck? Leave it to me
to embarrass myself on a first date.
A little bit... bit more on-on
the left b-ball... One.
Uh, left side. Of...
Dribbly bit. O
Thanks. I mean, no biggie. Trust me,
I've been through worse. I mean, as...
As a kid, I used to get made
fun of all the time.
My stutter. I-I used to have
a really bad stutter.
Actually took probably nine years of
speech therapy to get rid of it.
So, was there anything else they...
may have made fun of?
- I don't know.
- Anything at all?
Oh, yeah, some kids used to talk
a little smack about my neck.
- You know.
- Oh, thank God!
- What's up?
- I thought I was going crazy. L...
I mean... not a big deal...
at all.
Well, when I was six, I fell off my bike
and I landed on a sprinkler head...
and they had to stitch me up
at the hospital.
I mean, kids could be mean.
They used to call me Frankenstein.
They're like,
"He's alive. He's alive!"
Well, I don't care, you know.
Kids make fun of everything, right?
Ls it just me or did it suddenly
get a little chilly in here?
- Here we are.
- Man! Look at the size of those things.
Oh, Jake, buddy, would you mind
turning up the heat just a tad?
I think that, that vent's blowing
right on... Not a problem.
- Sure.
- Get this out of your way here.
Hey, how the hell are you guys?
You're good?
Hi, I'm Angie and this is
my husband Ray.
- Hi.
- This is my new friend, Beth.
She's slowly restoring
my faith in blind dates.
for getting this old workaholic
out of his office for once.
Nice work!
You caught the big one!
- Look how big little Evan's getting!
- Yeah. Little?
- No.
- Who's a big boy?
Wow, Ray, he's a monster. You got
yourself a little linebacker here.
A little linebacker that needs
to go to bed!
Okay. You're off to bed.
There you go.
- Fumble.
- Another pacifier down.
You guys look so cute.
I got to take a picture.
- Angie, please.
- Hey, let-let the man eat, honey.
Come on, Ray. We have a picture
of our first date.
Come on, get your fanny over there
behind her and don't be shy.
- All right. Okay, okay. All right.
- Okay.
- I'm sorry about this.
- Get in close.
Beth, I'm going to need
you to hold still.
Get down! Get your face down
next to hers! Come on!
Take it. Take it. Take it, take it,
take it, take it.
- So good!
- How's that?
Now why don't you give
each other a little kiss?
Oh, come on.
Angie, we just met.
Come on, let 'em eat!
Let the man eat!
- Come on! Just a little kiss.
- All right, all right.
We'll do one, one kiss
on the forehead.
- One peck on the forehead.
- We don't need to.
- Ready? Okay.
- We really don't.
It's uh, roast Sumatra.
I grind the beans myself.
Hey, thanks again for dinner.
You really didn't have to do this.
if we didn't have you over
for a welcome dinner?
Sean, Samantha was just saying
that they home school their son.
Well, we just think it's
the only way to make sure...
that he gets the best
education possible.
You should really consider
it for your kids.
Hey, you know, Kevin's upstairs
doing his homework right now.
I'm sure he'd love to talk
to you guys about it.
Wait. He... So you home school your son
but he still gets homework?
Lt's very important to us
that Kevin has...
a normal and complete
high school experience.
Written assignments are to be done in
black ink. Not green or blue or pink.
When are you going to get that through
your thick skull, Mr. Morris?
Move, move, move, move, move!
Pick it up! Pick it up!
Come on, girlfriend,
pick your knees up!
But don't you feel like maybe he's,
I don't know, missing out?
Yeah, high school is about more
than just classes and homework.
Absolutely. There's
the alienation, the loneliness.
It should be the unhappiest
time in a boy's life.
that Kevin doesn't miss out
on any of those essential...
emotionally scarring experiences
that he'd get at a regular school.
Hey, guys! Come check out
this kid's weird pubes!
Still, it must be an awful lot
of work for you guys, though.
Oh, sure, there is.
But we love it.
I think we've put together
a pretty comprehensive plan...
that provides Kevin with every
important adolescent experience.
You know, socializing
with other kids...
the girl you asked out before.
It's going to be awkward.
Sorry. No. Sorry, sorry.
No. Sorry. Okay, okay.
Mom. Mom, please no, wait.
Mom, just... lf l...
- Dicks.
- Louder!
- I suck dicks! I suck dicks!
- Like you mean it!
I suck dicks, I suck dicks,
I suck 'em all the time!
Lf you were a superhero,
what would your superpower be?
My superpower would be
sucking dicks!
Dude. You have so much
poop on you right now.
that should be the most awkward
moment in any boy's life.
Emily and Kara said
we should go all the way.
Don't tell Jeff or any
of those guys, but...
you'd totally be the kind
of guy that I'd like.
I don't think l'll ever forget
the first time Kevin told us that...
- He was only twelve.
- Precocious kid.
You know, studies show
that the average child...
doesn't express that kind of
self-loathing till they're fifteen.
Hey, honey.
Meet the neighbours.
Kevin, this is Sean and Clare. They
moved into the house three doors down.
Uh, pleased to meet you.
Welcome to the neighbourhood.
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Thank you. That's so polite. That's...
I'm heading out. A bunch of us are
going to meet up at The Green.
And, uh, yes,
I finished my homework.
Oh, and Jen and I are going to
catch a movie afterwards,
Oh, that's fine. Just make
sure you say hello from us.
Hello, Mrs. Miller.
I'm the pretty girl.
- You guys have fun tonight. -
All right.
- There.
- Oh, wow.
Would you care for
a chocolate-covered strawberry?
Oh my gosh, sweetie.
Talk about romantic.
Julie, we've been together
for over a year...
And in that time, I've come to realize
that you mean everything to me.
And there's something
I want to ask you.
There's something
I'd like to ask you.
- No, you go first.
- No, you first.
How about we say it
at the same time?
- One, two...
- One, two.
- What?
- Will you poop on me?
Wait, what did-
what did you say?
L... I trust you. I feel like
you're my soul mate.
I want to give you this gift.
I want you to be my first.
Are you not attracted
to me anymore?
Of course I'm attracted
to you, honey.
Ah, man. You just hit
the fucking lottery, man.
You don't think it's a little weird
for wanting him to shit on her?
Slow down, man. Have some
respect for this guy, okay?
Shitting is something
you do on a whore.
- Right.
- Right?
Pooping is a gift you give
to your soul mate.
- 'Course.
- I never looked at it like that.
So tell me, man, what's on the menu?
Before you do the big deed.
I don't... I don't know.
Does it fucking matter?
- Is she a vegetarian?
- No.
Boom! Big beef burrito, with
extra beans on that bad boy.
Put some salsa,
some guacamole for colour.
When it come out of you, it's a
festival. You know what I'm saying?
You went the extra yard
for your lady. You hear me?
No, I'm doing something
classy, okay?
I'm doing seared ahi tuna steaks,
a salad, and red wine.
- No. No, no, no! Fucking' no!
- Nice.
It's not about how fancy it goes in.
It's about how fancy it comes out.
Well... And believe me, Mexican
food makes a fucking' mess.
You know what salad does?
Lt locks down your bowels.
You don't want your bowels
all locked down, do you? No.
Drinks are cool.
Have a few fucking' drinks.
- Makes you last longer.
- Last longer?
You don't want to be Mr. Two Squeeze,
Thank-You Please, right?
- You really don't want to be that.
- Billy, goddamn, Billy.
Why don't you go over there while
grown people are talking over here.
Go over there and play with your
GI Joes or some shit, man.
Look it. Take my advice
on this one.
You go out tonight and you
shit on a few skanks. Okay?
Fucking' tomorrow, you are
a one-poop man.
Viagra, brother.
Poop Viagra. Yeah.
- Just carry that on you?
- Yeah, I carry that shit around on me.
- At barbecues?
- You goddamn right.
All your fucking' meat,
I got to clean that shit out.
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay? Fine, then.
- I'm ready, sweetie.
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, oh! You look nice.
- Thank you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Honey.
What are you doing?
What am I doing? I'm...
You know what I'm doing.
Oh, okay. Well,
I kinda-I kinda got to, uh...
No, no, no, no. Come here.
Come here and kiss me,
and then you can give me
your special present.
- Tell me how much you love me.
- Oh, I love you so much.
- How much?
- I love you so much I'd kill a man.
- I bought this special lavender lotion.
- Okay.
- Why don't you get my neck ready.
- You want it on your neck?
Okay, okay. There we go.
Let's get it and...
- No. No. Not yet.
- What?
- No. Come here.
- What?
- You're so excited.
- I know. I can't stand it.
Gosh. Remember the day
that we met?
Did you ever think that someday
you'd be able to...
- you know?
- Honestly, no. No, I didn't.
Do you remember what
I was wearing that day?
- Do you remember what I was wearing?
- A yellow sun dress!
Come on! Roll over and let me
shit on you, please!
I'm sorry. Poop on you.
I meant poop on you.
Oh, baby, please! I love you!
I want you to marry you!
- Doug! Doug! Call a fucking ambulance!
- I'm on it!
Hold on. Hold on, baby, okay?
Hold on. You're going to make it.
Oh, yeah? Lt's so beautiful. It's the
most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

I'm just carrying it.
Let's not have another
"chicken or the egg" debate, Neil.
- Chicken.
- Egg.

It's an over-the-chinos rub and tug
during your first AA meeting.
I would climb Dick Mountain
mouth first just to get her back!
Are we going to let
that foxy little thing...
run willy-nilly out
of this boy's life?
take that sweet ass
to pound town?
- When's your shift up?
- Five a.m.
- L'll take it till three.
- I got three to five!
Lt's not as exciting
as you might think. It's-it’s...
For me, I like to say it's more about,
just like, helping people, you know.
- It's not about punishing criminals...
- Right, yeah, I totally understand.
- It's just, it makes you feel good...
- Robin!
- Oh, no.
- Robin!
Hey, Robin. Where ya been?
Hi, how ya doing.
You missed your meeting
with your parole officer.
- What? Parole officer?
- No. He's kidding.
Yeah, yeah, this guy got in some
trouble a while back for...
whipping out his little
Dick Grayson on a playground.
But, it's all good. I mean,
your wife forgave you, right?
- What?
- You're married?
- Married pervert. Yeah.
- No, I'm not!
Stacey, I'm-I'm not married!
He's kidding!
The hell are you doing here, Batman!
You're going to ruin this!
Calm down!
Hey, look, I read on Twitter...
that a super-villain's going to bomb
this loser meet and greet.
So I'm here to save the day,
like I do, all the time.
- I'm the Batman!
- Yeah, baloney!
You're here to ruin my chances with
women like you do all the time.
No way, brother! No way!
No, I'm-I'm in support of this.
Get one more speed date, okay,
then we got to find that bomb.
Uh, little tip. Uh, less boy,
more wonder, right?
- Dazzle them!
- Yeah, okay. Thanks.
- Oh, hi.
- Lois. Lois Lane.
It's... it’s me, Robin.
We-We've met several times.
- Robin what?
- Ro-Robin. That's it.
You were like, "l'll never forget
this as long as I live."
- I thought you were dating Superman.
- No, no.
- We broke up about six months ago.
- I didn't-I didn't know that.
- He's been stalking me ever since.
- Really?
Last night, I look out
my bedroom window,
just stroking that nasty little
curl, and masturbating!
- He broke the window!
- The, the... From the...
You know that shiny stuff
in his hair? Lt's not hair gel.
- Lois! Oh, my God!
- Oh, no!
- Nice to see you!
- Nice to be seen! Oh, my goodness!
- Do you know each other?
- Yeah, we work together.
- You do?
- Hey, how's Superman?
I'm going to give him a call right now,
actually. I need...
- No, no! Don't do that!
- Oh, no, I'm going to do it.
- Batman, don't. Please. Please.
- It's already ringing.
Hey, Soups! What's up, brother!
Lt's the Dark Knight.
Hey, man, I was just thinking
about you here...
and she's on a date
with my boy, Robin.
- No!
- Oh, he hung up. I lost him.
Stay away from Lois
or l'll use my heat vision...
to fuse your balls into
one big ridiculous uniball.
Superman, you don't
understand.
I'm not here to hit on your
girlfriend. That's crazy!
Batman and I are undercover
and we're looking for a bomb.
Bomb? I don't give two
super-shits about a bomb.
As long as I'm balls-deep
in Lois, I'm solid gold.
Goddammit!
That's his thing!
"I mean, we're going to
be fighting crime, buddy, so..."
"Uh, you know, you should
put on some pants."
But he liked the costume
the way it is, so,
you know, what are
you going to do. Kids.
- Well... Thursday?
- Thursday it is!
- See ya then.
- All right, now.
You make me wear this.
He makes me wear this outfit!
She's a hoot! All right,
that was your date. Let's go.
- Bullcrap! That doesn't count!
- What do you mean that doesn't count?
Now, let's boogie.
We got to go find that bomb.
Please, just let me do one more.
That doesn't count. Please.
Oh, my God, you're such a baby.
Go! Sit down. Fine.
- Yes!
- Fine. Go ahead.
Have fun. But you're not
going to do it on your own.
- Pop that in your ear.
- What's that?
What I'm going to do is I'm going to
get underneath the table,
hide down there and feed you lines
to help bag this next gal.
Oh, right,
like Cyrano de Bergerac.
I don't know what that is.
It's more like Roxanne.
Okay, but look, I-I'd really
rather do this on my own.
Okay, and I hear you, and I appreciate
what you're saying,
- but I, you know, I'm going to do it.
- Please don't.
- I'm going to do it.
- Batman, don't. Please, please, don't...
Hi. Sorry, sorry I'm late.
There's a line in the bathroom.
- My name...
- I'm Robin.
- So, where you from?
- L... Um, Krypton.
Krypton, eh. Where...
That's, that's, uh...
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit!
- Dude, I can see her snatch.
- Dude, I can sn...
Oh, my God! I can't believe
the size of this thing.
It's like a giant fucking cornfield.
It's enormous down here.
It's crazy. Look at that.
I-I-I feel like at any moment,
Shoeless Joe Jackson could walk out
of it and I could play catch with him.
Krypton. I-I hear it's really nice.
I-I have never been...
You didn't hear that the Sun supernova
and destroyed our entire race?
It's a huge, bushy
catastrophe down here.
Feel like Sean Penn should do
a benefit for this thing. It's...
What? Oh, no.
You can hear him, can't you?
I can also see Batman
underneath the table.
Cause of the x-ray vision.
Of course.
No, I can just see him. It's a cafe
table. I mean, it's really obvious.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Ah, dude. I'm so sorry about
your family dying and...
Oh, man! That took me back
to the seventies, huh?
Hold on. There's our culprit.
It's the Penguin.
Excuse me. I'm going to go
do some Batman-ing.
Oh, it's hard to pick up with gloves.
There ya go.
Excuse me, sweetie. How ya doing.
You mind fucking off for a little bit?
Thank you. I appreciate it.
Thanks.
- See you later, citizen.
- How dare you!
You son of a bitch! Where's
the bomb, you fat fucker?
- Hey! Asshole!
- Oh, shit.
What do you think you are?
Some big man?
Take it easy! That's the Penguin.
That's what I do.
You said that you
we’re going to call me.
Wait a minute. Did I not? I know I
dialled a number... Did I not hit "send"?
You said that you were going to stick
by me no matter what happened.
And then your little Bat-condom
breaks, and then you just disappear!
Do you know what it's like going
to Planned Parenthood by yourself,
Roe v. Wade here
at a speed dating situation.
Uh, look, I was fighting crime!
Ask Robin. Robin, vouch for me.
- He cries after sex. Do you know that?
- Why would I know that?
Like a baby.
After sex, what do you say?
"Oh, my soul's so dark."
Because you saw some bats...
when you were little?
You pussy!
How the fuck did he
get over there?
Lt was all a clever ruse.
I'm not speed dating.
Some of you should remember
I'm happily married.
- That's right!
- You were all there at the wedding.
- Okay, bomb strapped to my chest.
- Oh, yes. In any case,
you all have to give me some
unimaginable sum of money...
or else I'm going to blow up
Super girl with this bomb.
Dat dat dat dat! The detonator
is in this umbrella.
- Cool it.
- No, you cool it.
My non-monocled eye!
Where are you?
- Are you okay?
- I think so.
Open her mouth
and touch tongues.
and that'll coax her tongue
to go into your mouth!
- Doesn't that look nice?
- It looks so nice.
Oh, yeah. Hold on!
Not so fast!
- Riddler!
- Riddler!
In a diabolical scheme to get Robin and
me to this speed date to stop a bomb,
only to lure Robin away
to some seedy warehouse...
where you're going to hang him above
a vat filled with thumbtacks...
That was amazing.
How did you do that?
I mean, how'd you know
that she was a fake?
Bush that size is only good
for one thing,
and that one thang is hiding' the Wang!
You know what I'm saying?
Wait. Let me get this straight.
So you knew all the way back then?
- You knew that she was a dude?
- Whole time.
I guess I woke up this morning with
a little case of the fuck-arounds.
You know I'm just having fun.
My buddy! Woo!
Working without thanks
to make your life better.
Can't you see
they're doing their best?
They're not trying to take
over your world.
They're just trying to find
a little place in your hearts.
Remember, machines,
they're full of kids.
- Who the fuck are you?
- I am the Minotaur.
Do you know where
we can find Movie 43?
Are you prepared to have your brains
butchered into tiny pieces?
Are you prepared to have a starving
rat nibble out your eyeballs,
and then have the holes fucked
by angry, thick-decked wolves?
Dude, calm down. I think you're-
I think you're just confused.
We're-we're talking about Movie 43.
You've never heard of that.
It is the one movie that can bring
down society as we know it.
No, dude. That's something
different. I guarantee it.
I have taken a Vow to keep
anybody from Viewing this film.
This guy's for real. He's protected
by firewalls I've never even seen.
Tyler De Soto. Fifteen.
Port St. Lucie, Florida.
I'm still not seeing what
the problem is, though.
The iBabe has an advanced
We left an opening for a vent and
then we placed a highly-efficient,
super powerful micro-fan
in the opening.
- And?
- The vent is in her,
- Vagina.
- Vagi-port.
A certain percentage
of our younger demographic...
are sticking their
you-know-what in the vent.
Kids are sticking
their penises in the vent.
The fan then mangles
their penises.
Yes, it also looks and feels
exactly like a naked woman.
Teenage boys are physically
attracted to naked women.
Our research doesn't
support that, sir.
Look, at the very least, we need to
put a warning sticker on the box.
Other MP3 players don't have a
warning not to have sex with it. Right?
A bag of potato chips
doesn't have a warning,
"Please don't fuck
these potato chips."
None of us could have
seen this one coming.
R and D team. You did
extensive testing here.
Did you anticipate anybody breaching
the cooling system? Any red flags?
Also, we've broken down
our problem into three steps.
Step 3: Kid mangles dick
and sues iBabe.
Our goal is to eliminate
step two and step three.
Why don't we just move the fan?
Why don't we just put it in her ear?
Uh, my team spent two years
doing the impossible,
and you're pretty much just telling us
to go back and start from scratch.
Okay, look. The iBabe weighs over
a hundred pounds, okay?
Lt's basically illegal
to take it out in public.
Women's organizations are calling
for the boycott of our entire company.
Our stock is plummeting and kids'
dicks are getting horribly mangled!
Sir, may I introduce you
to the iBabe Special Edition.
Faster processing,
double storage capacity,
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.
Finally we can give our customers
a choice of colour.
Oh, my God. Just when I thought
it couldn't get more offensive.
What do you want?
Money? Women?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
The movie that allows you
to see into the future.
He will unleash
the dead up in protocol!
Did Stevie Schraeder
tell you any of this?
- Who is this Stevie Schraeder?
- I don't know Stevie Schraeder!
- You lie!
- What the fuck?
Who is Stevie Schraeder? You tell
me where Stevie Schraeder is!
He's a kid in my fucking
Driver's Ed class!
You will find us Movie 43,
J.J. And Baxter.
- I'm looking!
- Don't look!
I'm, uh, RSVP-ing
to Sammy's Bar Mitzvah.
My mom always makes me
go to both. Sucks.
What? Mom told me to watch
you guys. I'm just doing my job.
- You have a bathroom?
- Totally. It's right back there.
- Yuck!
- Nathan?
My brother spilled fruit punch on the
couch. There's a big red stain.
But you're not getting picked up
for another half hour.
Want to sit and watch
some more TV?
Yeah. L'll-l'll just... l'll just
watch it from back here.
Whoa! Mikey spilled fruit
punch on the wall, too!
- My mom is going to be so pissed!
- Nathan, I really need to go!
Holy shit, you are covered
in blood! Oh, my God!
- What?
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! You must've s-sat
on a nail or something!
- You idiot! She's having her period!
- Oh, my God!
You don't know what to do?
You've never had your period before?
- No, I haven't.
- Oh, my God,
Mikey, she's already
lost a lot of blood!
Mom's got to have some tampons
around here somewhere, right?
Oh, my God!
This is not happening!
There-There's no way
they're going to fit you!
No, no, no, no! You can't walk
home in your condition, silly!
There's just plastic bags! I don't
know what the fuck you want me to do!
- What?
- Wipe yourself!
Hey, hey, hey!
Guys, I'm home early.
Oh, we're just going to have to plug
it up. I found this and this.
Nathan's date is on her period
for the first time,
- Oh, disgusting.
- What?
I mean, congratulations,
young lady.
"Congratulations"?
She's bleeding to death!
Oh, my God!
My stomach hurts!
N-Nine-one-one? Yeah, my friend
is bleeding out of her vagina!
Lt's just... it’s...
The-The lining of Amanda's...
internal organs just
spilling out of her.
the man has to insert his
erect phallus into her vagina.
- A what?
- You know what? I got a perfect thing.
- What the hell's going on here?
- Dad!
What the hell kind of sick family
squashes a large tomato...
Whoa. Watch what you're
implying about my family.
Oh, I don't got to watch
anything, Jack!
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
- You touching me?
- Yeah, yeah, bitch, yeah!
- You touching me?
- You're not to touch me!
- Let's go, bitch!
- Let's go!
Sucker punch him! Sucker punch
him in the throat!
Look, I'm just a regular seventh-grade
girl getting my period,
and it really sucks that it had
to be in front of all you idiots.
Dad, call Mom and tell her
to meet us at home.
You don't have a camping tarp
I could borrow, do you?
I've been trying to push that puppy out
since this morning's conference call.
Woo! I got to take a massive dump,
and then we're watching the game.
- Yeah.
- Yes!
- Stevie Schraeder?
- I freaking told you.
Wh... What the fuck!
How'd he get there?
What's Movie 43?
They keep asking me that.
- Cut off Stevie Schraeder's finger
- What!
No, don't cut off
Stevie Schraeder's finger!
Don't cut off Stevie Schraeder's
finger! Please!
It's just something Calvin
and I made up to prank you!
and we need to find it
or else your stupid friend dies!
- Unless...
- Unless what? Unless what?
I can fashion
a ninety-one-F-Theta Box.
No. Not the Theta Box. Please!
Do not do that!
Go! Make a Theta Box, dude.
Whatever that is.
Movie 43. Wh-Where is it?
Where is it?
Brian, we're best friends, man.
You can't move out.
- What?
- But I want to make it up to you.
when she found out
I slept with your girlfriend...
Best birthday present ever.
You are going to love this.
- Is this really necessary?
- Trust me.
I know, right, buddy?
Happy birthday.
Moron. There's no such
thing as leprechauns.
Tell my friend you're going
to give us a big pot of gold.
I'm going to cut off your balls
and feed them to you!
He's just joking. He's got to give us
the gold. That's the rules. Right?
The last thing you'll ever see is
my cock, skull-fucking you!
when I fuck you with
a pair of rusty scissors?
What are you doing?
You're going to kill him!
Watch out! Relax! L'll handle this,
okay? L'll handle this.
so what I'm going to do...
is untie you and let you go.
Lick my crusty lrish taint,
ya yeast-breeding cunt hole!
Lf he's dead, he can't tell us
where the gold is!
Fucking giants.
Motherfucking full-growns!
When all this is over, I'm going
to crawl up your mother's cunt...
Hey! No! Shut up!
You can't do anything...
because you're tiny and tied to a
chair, and nobody knows where you are.
So this is what a dead
man sounds like.
- It's another leprechaun.
- Fuck!
prepare to have your dickhole
stretched over a fucking fire hydrant!
- What's wrong with your fucking mouth?
- Gag him.
I got a leprechaun and I want some
gold or we're going to kill him.
How do you feel about
having your balls cut off?
I'm serious. You better
make with the gold...
or your little green man will be
pushing up four-leaf clovers!
That was so good.
You sounded so tough.
No way. How did he get
here so fast?
- Gold coins!
- Gold!
- Happy Birthday, dude!
- Holy crap!
So, we get the gold and
we keep this little fucker?
Did you hear that? Looks like
you’re lucky charms just ran out.
Who's magically
delicious now, bitch?
I couldn't hear you over my giant
pot of leprechaun gold!
- He shot me in the eye!
- He shot me in my nipples!
That's right, brother!
Fuck him up good!
This is what happens when
you take a leprechaun's gold!
Stab him with your leprechaun
knife! Cut off his balls!
- Walk to the rainbow.
- What?
- Cut off his balls!
- Help! Pete! Help!
Shoot him! Shoot
the fucking leprechaun!
You moron! Not that
leprechaun! This leprechaun!
Tell St. Patty you like it
up the ass!
Hey, Pete, I just want
to say thank you.
- Yeah, it is a lot of gold.
- Nah, it's more than gold.
Catching that leprechaun
must have been hard work.
Something that only a true
friend would do for me.
Yeah, well, I should have never
slept with your girlfriend.
Whatever. We can buy
new girlfriends.
Dude, I totally forgot
the second part of your gift!
- Who is she?
- She's a fairy. Storybook fairy.
What the hell am I supposed
to do with a fairy?
- What can I do?
- I need metal. Right now! Go!
- Trophies! Spoons!
- Stop yelling at me! L'll do it!
- Right.
- I'm go. Initiate sequence.
- And for you?
- Whynatte and rum, please.
Do you mind me asking a question?
Lt may seem personal.
I'm quite surprised that a lady
with your face needs to resort to...
- Match dot com?
- Right.
Truth is, I have completely
exhausted all of my options.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Oh, dear. That's a shame.
And are you from the area?
I've been on so many blind dates
in the past year,
"Where are you from?
What does your sister do?
What does your father..."
Blah, blah, blah.
Do you really care if my father
is a garbage man?
- Is your father a garbage man?
- No, he's not! That's the point.
- Who cares?
- Not important.
So let's not do that. Let's
have this date be different.
- Let's talk about real things, okay?
- Great.
- Real, straight conversations.
- I'm all about that.
So what does your father
do for a living?
- Okay.
- Have you played Truth or Dare?
I haven't played it,
but I'm aware of it.
Well, you start first.
You ask me, "Truth or Dare."
- Truth or Dare?
- Truth.
Is there any possibility
in this noble cosmos...
or any alternative parallel
cosmos where you might...
- And that's good?
- I like tall.
I knew you'd say that. I am going to
push the limits just a little bit.
- Are you circumcised?
- Am I circumcised?
Circumcision has never really taken
off, to be honest, where I'm from.
I tend to associate it
with Jewish people...
and we don't have many Jewish
people in Europe anymore...
But if you would need me to get
circumcised, I'm sure I could.
- Truth or Dare?
- Truth.
When was the last time
you kissed a man?
Twenty-six days ago in an alley behind
a Pilates studio. Truth or Dare?
Dare. I'm going
to go with a Dare.
Here we go. Now we're
cooking. Okay.
See that man with the black
jacket? The husky guy?
I dare you to go
and pinch his ass.
- Do what now?
- Just cup it.
- No.
- Yeah.
You said Dare, not me.
That's what Dare is.
- Have a look at him. He's quite...
- I see him.
- He might have a knife.
- I don't even have to be here.
I can go home and watch Family Guy
if you don't want to play.
L'll get the check.
Excuse me!
- Can I have the check?
- She doesn't need the check.
- Then go cup his ass.
- Okay, I will.
I call him, and he never answers
the phone. I'm sick of it.
- Go pay him a visit.
- You call him.
- What the fuck?
- I did. Sorry.
You touching my fucking ass!
What's the matter with you!
- What do you mean, you? Fuck you!
- Sorry. Sorry.
- You touch the wrong ass, asshole!
- It's all good.
- What's the matter with you?
- Sorry. Apologies. Sorry.
No. You can't dare me to do the
same thing I just dared you to do.
- Truth or Dare.
- Come up with your own dare.
See that blind kid over there?
Blow out his candles before he can.
Lt's Truth or Dare.
That's the rule.
I could take off if you want.
I could go home.
L'll probably get home in time
to put Benny Hill DVDs on.
- You're doing that?
- It's up to you.
L'll go over there and
blow out the candles,
I wish it was my birthday
So I could party, too
Happy, happy birthday
May all your dreams come true
Happy, happy birthday
From all of us to you
Excuse me. I got $200.
Can you give me the whole thing?
I dare you to make guacamole
with your right breast.
"...elucidate several most important,
however...
intricate passages and scenes
hereafter to be painted."
"Stub’s whale had been killed
some distance from the ship."
When the swelling goes down,
you're going to look great, Emily.
- That was fun, huh?
- Yes. I had a really great time.
- It was definitely interesting.
- Yeah. We did a lot.
- We did it up.
- Yes.
It was enchanting.
You're really a...
- Well, thank you.
- Yeah.
This is that slightly
awkward moment.
You're sweet, really, and
I really did have a good time...
but I'm just not that attracted
to Asian men.
We don't want these puppies
to go to waste.
- I need one more!
- I'm freaking out, man!
- What the fuck did you do?
- Movie 43.
I used to be great
cameraman in Russia.
- We don't have much time.
- You little shit!
It has been 1 41 days
since The Darkness.
J.J., Calvin and Baxter,
this is Movie 43!
You see, when you idiots made
me search for Movie 43...
we triggered the Terrapin Protocol,
the top-secret Cold War initiative...
to control the mind
of every American citizen.
So that in the event
of a Soviet attack...
every man, woman and child would
be converted into fighting machines.
Only there were no more
Soviets to fight.
So everyone turned on each other
and now the country is in ruins.
Amsterdam? Still not
a goddamn country! Gone!
That is why I'm sending
this message back in time.
Baxter, listen to me.
You need to hack into...
Son of a bitch, J. J! I'm trying
to rewrite the fucking past!
Yeah? Some Infected were trying
to rewrite your fucking existence!
Oh, man, this is sick!
Where am I?
I'm sorry, Mommy!
I'm sorry, Mom!
You fucking feed him!
I need to be out slaughtering.
You must stay here where it's safe,
where I can protect you.
- I'm sorry!
- Come here, Mama.
- Sorry, Mommy.
- Back to business.
Security breach! Security breach!
Commence evasive manoeuvres.
- Defensive manoeuvres!
- Dammit, they jumped the wire!
VrankoVich!
On me, you dumb Ruskie!
Baxter! You can prevent
this from happening!
Hack into the Department
of Defence security mainframe...
using a Mark-7 Spartan from
the Bundesnachrichtendienst...
- No way!
- Oh, shit!
- That was awesome!
- No way!
Dude! No way! I'm never
making fun of you again. Period.
We were trying to prank you!
You turned that around...
Oh, my God. You're
expecting me to believe...
that somehow in the next
six months the whole world ends...
- and I'm a drooling cripple?
- I didn't do it!
What's with the lights?
That was weird.
I'm going to the supermarket.
Does anyone need anything?
- I'm sorry, Mommy! I'm sorry!
- What are you sorry about?
- What's happening?
- Shit!
That computer's fried. Go get
my laptop out of my room!
All right, I got it! I got it.
Don't worry.
- Don't let him pull his own dick off.
- Why would he pull his own dick off?
In 1959, Kenny Jackson coached
the Ellison High Journeymen...
to become the first Negro
high school team...
Come on, y'all. Why y'all still sitting
here? The game's all about to start.
There's 10,000 white people out there
that think that we ain't good enough.
You know what?
Maybe we ain't.
the black man has been
spit on, kicked...
But I've got two things
I can tell you.
It's just that plain
and fucking simple.
But them white boys
from Hickory Tech...
- What game are we playing?
- Basketball, Coach.
- White.
- Exactly!
Come on, people.
You guys are 25 and 0.
Yeah, Coach, but that was
against all-black teams.
That's the point! Y'all are going
to kill those Caucasians!
But, Coach, look at
their fundamentals.
The fundamentals!
Lt doesn't matter!
Lt's all the same when you're some
cement-foot troglodyte white boy...
getting dunked on with a big pair
of black fucking nuts...
Speaking of nuts...
Luscious.
Tell them.
How long is your dick?
All right, let's kick some butt.
You scared?
You Negroes going
to play basketball, or what?
Yeah, you Negroes.
What's the matter?
Did you realize you didn't belong
in a white man's game, you Negroes?
That's right. This isn't
a game for Negroes.
It's a game for good, honest
white people, not for Negroes.
- White Knights!
- White Knights!
"They looked tough"?
I'm so scared!
One of them might dribble
with his left hand...
all the way down the lane and then
go up for a left-handed layup...
and you know what's going
to happen then?
Your black ass is going
to swat that shit...
jump over his cracker ass, and
dunk in his goddamn face!
How many fucking times
do I have to tell you?
You're black, they're white,
this ain't hockey!
Guys, I think what Coach is trying to
say is that the key word is "teamwork."
No, the key word is
"you're black, they're white"!
So, Coach, what you're saying is,
if we just walk with the Lord...
The Lord? Nigger, the Lord
done did his part already!
He made you black.
He made them white.
He gave you a foot-and-a-half dick!
Dribble with that motherfucker!
As long as y'all are out
there on the floor...
you're going to score more
points than them.
Cut that goddamn
slow clap shit out!
- Let's go!
- Come on!
when Luscious Williams dribbled
the entire length of the court...
the referees had no choice
but to call a technical foul...
sending young Bobby Lee Mayflower
to the line...
for the most dramatic
moment of the contest.
- Baxter, turn that shit off, man.
- Okay.
I'm going to go to
the bathroom, all right?
- I don't know, but I been told
- I don't know, but I been told
Some guys shoot the shit, and some
people get shot with shit. Right?
- Am I right?
- I don't know what he's talking about.
You know what the fuck
I'm talking about.
- Sorry. Fuck.
- Not a problem.
No, I can just see him
underneath the table.
And he's had his fingers in
my pussy for the last five minutes.
It's monstrous. It looks like she's
sitting on Art Garfunkel's shoulders.
No one leaves this room
till we figure this out.
- Mangled dicks.
- Mangled dicks. Mangled...
- Dicks.
- Dicks.
No, Mikey, there's steel
wool on one side.
Okay, Amanda, you're going to want
to keep the yellow side up.
Otherwise, there's going
to be lots more blood.
So what you're saying is, if we go
out there and give 1 10 percent...
A hundred and ten percent!
Fifty percent! Three percent!
I think what Coach is trying to say is
that the key word here is "teamwork."
Luscious, will you whip out your dick
and smack this motherfucker with it?
- What?
- I love you even more.
- Oh, Anson.
- I do.
- Me, too.
- You do?
He's America's favourite cat...
Beezel
I'm embarrassed to even
say this, but...
Amy, ever since you moved
in here, l...
- What?
- I love you even more.
- Oh, Anson.
- I do.
- Me, too.
- You do?
Hey, Anson, do you ever feel like
your relationship with Beezel...
Please don't tell me
you're one of those girls...
No, no. I just don't think
he likes me very much.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- What happened?
- Beezel...
It's something male cats do sometimes.
It means he likes you.
- He likes me?
- Yeah.
Or it could mean that he's sick.
Buddy, are you sick?
- I caught him masturbating.
- He was probably just cleaning himself.
It was to pictures of you
in a swimsuit!
Cats can't even process
images in that way.
He just put a fucking
thermometer in his mouth!
I do, but as long as that
little fucker is around...
If it'll make you happy,
l'll find another home for Beezel.
- You'd get rid of him?
- I will.
- I love you.
- I love you.
Come out, come out,
you little rat-fucker.
Shit, I told my mother we'd
have him there in an hour.
She was nice enough
to take him off our hands.
- Do you mind checking outside for him?
- Absolutely.
