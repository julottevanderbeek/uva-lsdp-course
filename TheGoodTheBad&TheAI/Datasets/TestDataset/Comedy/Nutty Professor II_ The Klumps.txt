I'd like to come over there

right in front ofJesus.
Sweet Lord, give me strength.
Don't make me have to whup
nobody's head in church.
Ignore him, Lord.
Ignore all his prayers.
He ain't nothing,

Now I'm gonna cr.
Yeah, all right.
Dynamite.
You may be seated.
Oh, thank God.
Oh, thank God.
lalways knewhe'dfind
the rightgirl. Always knew.
You see the Indian
in her cheekbones ? Ooh !
Sherman, Sherman. Sherman.
Sherman, Sherman, Sherman.
Sherman ! Oh, Lord.
Shh, my baby's so stupid.
Dearly beloved,
we have gathered here today...
tojoin these two people
in holy matrimony.
- Praise the Lord.
- The eminentscientist,
ProfessorSherman Klump...
- Mm-hmm.
- andhis longtimesweetheart,
Denise Gaines.
Oh, Sherman.
lfanyone hasany reason
why these two shouldnot be wed,
let him speaknow...
or forever hold his penis.
-
- Oh, Sherman.
-
That's it, son.
Show 'em what the Klumps
are made of !
- Sherman, put that away.
- Sherman, calm down, baby.
Save it forthe honeymoon.
- Surprise !
-
-
- Hey, Sherman, calm down, boy.
What's wrong with you ?
- This is some scar shit.
- Yeah, like The OuterLimits.
No, don't hurtyourself, baby.
You are coming with Buddy.
- No ! No !
- See you later, chunky butt !
No !
And then I wake up
in a cold sweat.
How often do you have
this dream ?
More andmore lately.
You seem to be ver fond
ofthis girl, Denise.
My God, she is so special to me.
But how's she gonna love me when
I got Buddy Love inside me ?
I wanna be perfect for her.
Perfect ?
No one is perfect, Sherman.
You need to understand
that Buddy Love
is a representation...
ofthe uninhibited,
hedonistic id.
- He is not a real person.
- Buddy Love is real !
Well, he was real,
and he does take control
of me sometimes.
You willneverlearn
to controlhim...
Sherman !
untilyou accept the fact
that he is apart ofyou.
Yeah, and the best part too !
And I'll tell you
something else, punk !
All these diplomas on this wall
don't make up for the fact...
that you got
a little Vienna sausage
in your drawers.
- Is that why
they call you a shrink ?
- Shut up, fat a--
-
- Sorr.
Yeah, yes.
Session got a little outta--
outta control.
You see, we all have
a little Buddy Love inside us.
Yeah.
But we can't let him
rule our lives.
You're in charge, Sherman.
Can you say that for me ?
I'm in charge.
Can't hearyou.
- I'm in charge.
- Can't hearyou !
I'm in charge !
Sorr about that.
Yeah.
Klump in charge !
I'm in charge !
He's right. I am in charge.
Klump in charge. Yes, indeed.
Good afternoon, ladies.
Yeah.
Hey, Professor Klump.
How's it going ?
Fantastic. How about yourself?
Yeah.
Klump in charge.
Afternoon.
Good day.
Hi.
How you doing ?
Wonderful day.
- Beautiful day,
isn't it, Professor ?
- Bite me, old hag. Oh !
- What ?
- Uh, uh, I said, he likes me.
Look at him wag.
Hey, little fella.
See that little tail wagging ?
Have a good day.
I'm in charge.
My goodness.
Kinda hot today,
huh, Professor ?
You have no idea how hot it is.
- Hot ! Nice and hot !
- Oh, Professor ! I loved
your lecture the other day.
Oh, thankyou.
Thankyou so much.
You're the man.
You're the man.
I'm in control.
Yeah, keep tellin'
yourselfthat, bubble butt !
-
-
It is theoretically possible
to isolate the elements...
ofan individual's
genetic makeup
and separate them.
Nowsomeday, we may be able to
locate an unhealthy risk factor
in ourDNA andremove it.
Excuse me. Beg your pardon.
l'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Whether this is advisable
is another question entirely.
Oh, my eye !
Oh, Professor Klump.
Oh ! Professor Gaines,
how are you ?
I was hoping I might be able
to sit in on your lecture.
I'm sure we can accommodate you
since you were so quiet coming in.
Well, it's ver hard
to be quiet...
when you're lecturing
on genomic extractions.
I think it's ver exciting.
Oh, lagree completely.
Something about the way
the nucleotides cohere
with the target sequence.
Yeah. I always say,
ifyou can't be with
the nucleotide that you love,
cohere with
the one you're with.
-
-
- Yeah.
- Uh, anyway as I was--
Uh, l want those
lab reports on my desk.
No excuses.
I'll see you next time.
Professor Gaines.
Oh, Professor Klump.
Yeah.
Um, yes, I was, um--
I was wondering ifyou had a--
- Dean Richmond, we were--
-Just having... a little chat.
Don't be bashful,
ProfessorGaines.
Pound for pound,
this big lug's the greatest
scientist on the planet.
Andlet's be honest,
poundforpound, he is aplanet.
That's said with love.
- Did you get those
goo-goo clusters I sent you ?
- Yes, I did, thankyou,
but I'm on a diet right now,
so I can't eat 'em.
Andit's working beautifully.
No, l'm tellingyou.
When I came in, with this light
and in that outfiit, you could
really think for a second that--
Anyway, you said you had
something to show me.
I am so excited
about this, Dean.
You will be too.
You got that ?
Come on. Jason,
where's our patient ?
Right here, Professor.
Come on, boy.
Now this is Buster.
Buster suffers from acute
arthritis and diminished vision,
which are both signs
ofadvanced aging.
We're gonna see ifwe can fiix
all of Buster's problems
right now, aren't we, Buster ?
Yes, we are.
This little experiment...
makes use
ofProfessorGaines's brilliant
research ongene targeting.
Now, if I've composed
this formula properly,
this should be most impressive.
All right, Buster.
Jiminy freaking Cricket !
Sherman, this is amazing.
You'vejust discovered--
The fountain ofyouth.
This is huge.
Doyou have any idea
whatyou've done ? This is
unbelievable. We're rich.
We're gonna have every
pharmaceuticalcompany
in the world...
lining up
to throw money at us.
Ofcourse, it all has to be
properly tested fii rst.
Exactly, yes.
He makes an interesting point.
Here's another. Shut up !
Besides,
look at the little fella.
He can lick his own winky again.
There's not a guy in the world
who wouldn't wanna do that.
Klump !
Dean Richmond !
The effect is only temporary.
l'm sorry, sir.
You're sorr ?
Oh, my goodness.
I'm just tring not to think
where that tongue has been !
You all right ?
Klump, party ofsix, please.
Yes, and we're hungr.
Mama, you know,
you really look good.
Have you been losing weight ?
Oh, thankyou, baby, no,
but I'm getting ready
to start a new diet.
Have some ofthis ambrosia.
I don't even like ambrosia.
Don't tell me you don't like
ambrosia. You had some before,
and you liked it.
Have some adventure !
Oh, now I'm a child--
I don't know what I like.
...for the all-girls
soccer team.
Let me get that foryou.
Oh, my baby's so gallant.
Sherman, come here.
And it's called
''All the porkyou can eat'' diet.
You can have all the pork
you want. You can have ham,
bacon, sausage.
I got the wrong thing.
Take that.
Thankyou.
Now I got a full portion.
Whateveryou wanna eat,
just as long as you have
three glasses of grapefruit
juice afterwards...
because the grapefruitjuice
breaks down all the unwanted--
Get away from there !
Stop that ! Baby !
Honey, get the baby.
He's a boy, andboys
don't be doing stufflike that.
- Hey ! Get your ass--
- What ?
Please teach that boy manners.
He ain't gonna be acting
like no hooligan with me.
That was a spoon or fork ?
That was a spoon. All right.
Boys willbe boys.
- Boys will be boys.
-
Oh, this looks fabulous.
Yeah, it looks really good.
How about getting another bottle
of red over here ?
Getsome more wine.
Hey, Ernie, maybe
you wanna pace yourself
and take it easy, huh ?
Pace myself?
Hey, this is a celebration
for Daddy retiring.
We owe it to Daddy
togetshit-faced,
andl'm gonnagetshit-faced.
By the way,
congratulations, Mr. Klump.
She's so polite.
Look here, Denise, you have to
stop that ''Mr. Klump'' stuff...
'cause I've been hearing that

You know what they say ?
You're as young as you feel.
- Well, I must be 1 97.
- Klump, funny

has proven to be promising.
Ooh, Baby,

Hey, can we get some toothpick ?
Some toothpick !
If I wanna put a trumpet

All I'm hearing is

I don't wanna hear that.
Hey !

Now you see what you did,
Joe College ? You done

Jason, I just know
I'm not the one saying
all those awful things.
It was him.
You may be right, Professor.
Take a lookat this reading.
Right there. Recombining
with the gene that governs
testosterone production.
Buddy Love.
I told you.
That's Buddy Love.
Don'tpanic. Allright.
We should be able
to get rid of him.
According to Denise's theories,
we should be able to isolate
that gene and extract it.
No, no way.
Professor,
whatyou're talking about
is extremely dangerous.
Those traces ofBuddy
must've been inyoursystem
this whole time.
You've been able
to keep them under control.
Not anymore. He's back now.
He's coming back 'cause
he knows I'm happy and he
wanna ruin everthing.
Yeah, but he is not a he.
He is a gene.
He'sjust part ofyou.
Oh, no, he's not.
Am I interrupting ?
Oh, uh, not at all.
We werejust doing some
last-minute tests on Buster.
Yeah.
Uh, Sherman, can I talk to you
in private forjust a second ?
Sherman, I got a call today,
and, well, I've been offered
a full professorship
at the University of Maine.
University of Maine ?
But, Denise, that's in Maine.
Yeah.
Oh.
Well, uh, that's
a fii ne department
over there in Maine.
It is gonna be a...
tremendous loss
to Wellman, though.
Well, I haven't decided
to leavejust yet.
You haven't ?
Well, no, I mean--
There's something
ver important to me here,
and I'm not so sure
I can just leave it behind.
Well, Denise, you can fii nish
the research we started
on your own.
Sherman, I'm not talking
about research.
Really ?
Sherman,
you're ver special to me.
Oh, well, uh,
I didn't...
thinkyou and I
would ever-- ever--
because of--
How can I put it ?
Because I'm--
Big.
Yeah. I was gonna say fat,
but, yeah.
Big is better, yep.
Sherman,
that doesn't matter to me.
What matters to me is that...
you're kind and decent.
You are...
the most brilliant man
I've ever known.
Uh, speaking ofwhich,
I shouldn't keep you
from your research,
so, um,
I'll talk to you later.
Okay, I'll see you soon.
My goodness.
Professor?
You okay ?
Yeah. I just don't wanna
hurt her,Jason.
Then you won't.
Hey, you can controlBuddy.
You know, it's funny
how you get used to certain
things in life, you know ?
You get used
to being overweight.
I know I did.
You even get used to people
making fun ofyou.
Somewhere along the line,
I got used to being alone.
And I just don't wanna
be alone anymore.
Denise! Denise!
Oh, Sherman,

But what are you
doing down there ?
Please, come inside.

Hey, what you playing that for ?
I thought it'd be soothing.
It'd be soothing ifyou turned

Oh, Clesius,

I know what you look like.
We married for 44 years. I look
at you ever day, all day long.
- I knowjust

- Clesius, please, look at me !
Damn.
Now here we go.
You got a show tonight ?
What you got that on for ?
Well, ifyou don't know
after 44 years of marriage,
I don't know what to say to you.
You should say good night and
take that damn rag off that lamp
before we burn something down.
- Hell.
-
There !
What about Viagra ?
Viagra don't work for me.
I've been taking 'em like M&M's.
Look, Clesius,

Um, lmean, retired.
You know, sometimes

Lose self-esteem ?
I ain't lost no self-esteem.

You're like a broken record.
Ever time I turn around,
''Clesius, how you feeling now ?''
''You got the groove now ?''
Ever time I walk in the room,
I don't even wanna hear it.

Go to sleep, please.
Let it happen naturally.
Never mind, Clesius !
Never mind !
I mean, I'm sorr to yell

You want tenderness ?
Ease up on the pressure.
Too muchpressure forme.
Slowit down, lsaac.

Hey, Professor!
Wake up.
Oh. Oh,Jason.
My God, what happened ?
Buddy.
I had to get rid of Buddy.
What ?
He had to go.
You could've killed yourself.
I mean, who knows ?
This could affect
your coordination,
your neurological system.
It could even affect
your intelligence. We don't
even know ifthis is gonna work.
Only one way to fii nd out.
Okay, Sherman,
what is this about ?
Denise.
l'm sogladyou came.
You know, I almost didn't come.
Well, l'm awfulglad
you did.
Listen to me, Denise.
Listen.
You know, fii reflies,
when they're searching
for a mate,
the way they findone another
is they emit apheromone,
and I've synthesized it
into a spray form.
Wait a minute.
You brought me out here
for an experiment ?
Denise, wait, please !
Just hear me out !
Please, don't leave.
Sherman, why did you act
that way the other night ?
Well, Denise,
when I found out that you might
be leaving, itjust got me
all messed up inside.
I said some things
I really didn't mean at all.
lt was-- lt waslike
there wasanotherperson
inside me...
who didn't appreciate
how wonderful you are to me
and how special you are to me.
And-And--
But thatside ofme

You look fantastic.
lfyou two can stop

perhaps I can give you something
to really celebrate.
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes, Dean, what's that ?
Oh, nothing much.
A letter from
Phleer Pharmaceuticals, largest
drug company in the world.
I told them about your
little discover, and they
made a preemptive offer.
Not too shabby, eh ?
A hundred and fiifty
million dollars !
Oh, my God, Sherman !
A hundred and fiifty
million dollars !
Oh, my goodness.
lsn 't that wonderful?
Now, remember, that money
belongs to Wellman.
All you have to do is prove
to Phleer the formula works at
the press conference I set up.
Yeah ! Of-Ofcourse.
$1 50 million-- my mind's
all scribble-scrabble.
Oh, Mama, lcan't wait
to see whatshe looks like
in my old wedding dress.
I can't wait to see, Mama.
She gonna--
Oh !
Oh, seeingyou in that dress
take me right back to the time
lgot married.
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, you look wonderful.
Show Mama what you look like.
Mama, look at this.
Oh, you look so lovely.
Oh, be careful now.
She looks fabulous in it,
don't she, Mama ? Look at her.
Denise, you still remember
what I told you
about marital relations ?
Oh, Mama. Denise, look.
Tr this pie.
I made it with Snickers.
Now, don't be shy.
Come on over here.
Oh, that's pretty.
Okay, ifyou get bored
with your man,
it'sperfectly okay topicture
someone else's headon his body.
Right.
Ooh, you got
a little waist, girl.
That's right. That gentleman,
Stone Phillips, on NBC.
You know, Granny,
I really don't think
I need to do that.
Isaac, you don't need
to hear this.
It's private. It's private !
We gonna talk
girl talk now, baby.
From time to time,
lhave fantasies about
Stone Phillipsfrom NBC.
- Mama. Mama, quiet.
- It's true. It's the same
dream all the time.
I'm in a tobacco barn.
Stone Phillips is my coworker,
andhe don't neverhave on
no shirt in the dream, andl
don't neverhave on nopants.
It's the nougat
that makes it chewy.
And I stand on this ladder,
Stone Phillipsget a
littlepeek ofheaven
lgot up myskirt.
I invite him up the ladder,
he come up the ladder
and throw me on the tobacco.
And we startgoing at it
like two mice.
Stone, Stone, Stone.
Mm !
Oh, I think that's
a wonderful fiit.
I do too.
Oh, you're so sweet.
Sherman and Denise !
Sherman and Denise !
Marriage, marriage,

Theygonnaget married, Mama.
Ooh, l'm so happy.
Welcome back.
Marriage, marriage,
marriage, marriage.
~~~Nutty, nutty, nutty

~~~ Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa~~~~~~
Well, well, well,
we've seen quite a bit
ofeach othertoday.
Now strip down
to your shorts.
Right.
lsupposeyou thought l was
gonna object to a strip search,
didn 'tyou, Chief?
Keepyourclothes on, please.
Don't nobody wanna see that!
Here's my wallet. Why don't you
check foryourself?
Yeah, hold that stomach in,
Robert !
What's his problem ?
I don't know,
but enough is enough.
Excuse me, sir.
Young man, willyouplease
keep it downjust a little bit
'cause we're trying to watch--
Just when you thought
it was safe to go back
to the theaters.
Hello, fat ass !
Maybe we should get going.
I don't feel too good
all ofa sudden. Let's go.
Come on,
let's go somewhere else.
Sherman, who was that ?
- I don't know. I didn't really
get a good look at him.
- Sherman ! Sherman Klump !
You still been
hitting them Happy Meals.
You haven't changed an inch.
You remember me-- Buddy Love.
We used to both chase that girl,
Carla, at the same time.
- You ever hit that ?
- Miss Purty and I
werejust friends.
''Just friends''--
I guess that means
you didn't hit it, huh ?
Who's your new friend ?
She sure is fii ne. Yes, fii ne.
What's your name ?
Sherman, suddenly
I don't feel so well.
Can we leave, please ?
Yes, let's go, please.
Can I talk to Sherman for one
second ? Then you can have him.
Onesecond, please.
lgotta talk toyou.
We gonna have a little boy talk.
Excuse us. Sherman,
how you doing, baby ?
What do you want here ?
A little respect.
You left me all by myself
in that test tube...
without a card or a letter,
and now I want a divorce.
And this is
a community property state,
so I want my share.
Want your share ofwhat ?
The youth formula
we invented !
You mean, the youth formula
that I invented.
Oh, no way, Buddy, no way.
- Who you grounding, fat boy ?
You grounding me ?
- lhaven't grounded--
- I was hoping we could do this
like gentlemen.
- Come on, Sherman.
You're gonna make me do
something nasty to you, Sherman.
I'll do something nasty.
Sherman !
Seeyousoon, Sherman !
Sherman !
Sherman !
What the hell
are you looking at ?
Oh, thankyou, Sherman.
What else did I get
from Sherman ?
What does this say ?
''Phleer Pharmaceuticals.''
$1 50 mill-- $1 50 million.
I think Buddy's going shopping.
Professor,
I got here as fast as I could.
I've got to hide this formula
before Buddy gets to it.
Goodidea.
I found something
I thinkyou should look at.
When I left here last night,
everthing was fii ne.
I mean, this was not here.
Good Lord. Buddy must've
recombined from the genomic
sequence I extracted.
This doesn't make any sense.
He'sjust a fragment
of genetic information.
He's nothing without
a strand of DNA
to graft himselfonto.
Where-Where
did he get it ?
Mm.
Just a second here.
Buster !
Thankyou so much.
Leanne Guilford.
President ofAcquisitions.
Buddy Love, president
of Love Industries.
Allergies ?
No. Do you have a dog ?
Yes, I do-- a Yorkie.
Oh.
She's driving me crazy
right now.
- Bitch.
- Excuse me.
It's a female dog that you have,
and she's in heat, right ?
Yes. How did you know that ?
Let'sjust say I have
a sixth sense about
those things. Is this her ?
Yeah, little Courtney.
Ooh, nasty.
Mr. Love, maybe we'd better
do this another time.
No, this is the perfect time.
Let's do this right now.
This is the perfect time
to talk about my youth formula.
We are already committed
to purchasing
Professor Klump's formula.
Oh, Professor Klump's formula ?
That's if it works.
Let'sjust that although
he's a brilliant scientist,
at times, he can be unstable.
Yes.
Huh.
Interesting.
Yes, now, my formula works...
and can be yours for the price
of $1 49 million, ifyou act now,
pretty lady.
Forgive me for being blunt,
but you don't expect me tojust
take your word for it, do you ?
Oh, no, not at all.
Just say when, and I'll
make it available to you.
All right.
If Klump can't deliver and you
can prove your formula's better,
Yes ?
Phleer would have to
seriously consider it.
Is that right ?
I've got to go to a meeting.
Can we reschedule for later ?
We certainly can.
Good. How about
Wednesday, 7:00 ?
Perfect. Wednesday at 7:00.
- Bring the formula.
- Yes.
Excuse me.
Where's your restroom ?
Down the hall, to the left.
Thankyou.
You fii nished with this ?
Sure.
Whoo, whoo !
What the hell
you looking at ?
Huh ? Oh !
GoodGod!
What ''good God'' ?
I went on the paper !
Genetic anomalies can occur...
in any living organism
through-- through--
Come on now, people.
Spontaneous mutation.
Now what is it
that ourgenetic codes
can determine about us ?
Miss Tate ?
Uh, they can determine...
whetheryou have blue eyes
or pouty lips or a cute butt.
Stufflike that.
Right, right, precisely.
Ver good.
But what about random nucleotide
polymorphisms, Professor ?
Excellent question.
Random nucleotide
polymorphisms--
Random nucleotide
polymorphisms--
Random nucleotide--
I ain't got a clue.
Who knows ? This couldaffect
yourcoordination,
yourneurologicalsystem.
- lmean, it could even affect
yourintelligence.
- What was I talking about ?
- Genetic anomalies.
- Yes, genetic anomalies.
As I was saying--
Thinkyou're
prettysmart, huh, Molly ?
Notgonna beat me again.
Oh.
That makes fiive times
in a row now.
Hey.
- Can I talk to you
for a second ?
-Jason, yes, please, come in.
Look, lknowyou think
you're feeling fine, but lran
some more tests anyway.
- Really ?
- Yeah.
Whenyou extractedBuddy,
somehow it altered the gene
that regulates neurotransmitter
activity to the cerebral cortex.
Uh,Jason, all these big words
are really perplexing to me.
Can you talk in plain English ?
You're losing
your intelligence, sir.
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I know.
I can feel it.
I can't even beat Molly,
and she's the dumbest hamster
we got.
Jason, mypresentation's
in two days.
Now what am I gonna do ?
Oh, mygoodness.
Buddy.
Oh, thank God.
Hey, how's it going there,
Sherman ?
Yeah, Daddy, you startled me.
- What's that
you got there, son ?
- The youth juice.
Um, um, my formula.
I was wondering if I could
keep it here for safekeeping.
Oh, yeah, leave it
in the refrigerator.
Ain't nobody gonna bother it.
You allright ?
You looka little strained.
What'sgoing on ?
Well, Daddy, you know,
I kinda got a lot on my mind.
Really, I do. I guess
I've been a little worried
about my presentation and all.
Worriedabout
yourpresentation ? You ain 't
got nothing to be worriedabout.
We gonna be watching you on TV,
supporting you, and you should
be proud. We proud.
I know I'm proud.
I tell you that. You ain't got
nothing to worried--
You're gonna be doing
just great.
Ah !
I didn't hit you that hard.
Don't act like a little bitch.
By the way, Sherman,
how many people can say
that they raised a genius ?
lcan.
Worried about
his presentation ?
That's a good one there.
- Ooh, is this supposedto be
that hard ?
- Yeah, let it set a while.
Don't worr if it
burns a little bit.
That's natural.
All right,
you the expert, Chantal.
Workyour magic, girl,
'cause Denise's motheris coming
to this bacheloretteparty,
andifshe's
asstunning asDenise,
lgot to besparkling.
Honey, you gonna blind
their asses.
When you walk in that door,
they gonna think
you're Tyra Banks.
Oh, didltellyou the news ?
Leon got
one ofthem penis pumps.
Penis pumps ?
What'd he do with it ?
Mm-hmm.
- Supposed to pump it up
or something.
- Does it work ?
Just on the tip.
Now that thing look
like a portabello mushroom.
-
- Isaac all natural.
Soon as I walk in the room,
ten-hut.
You know,
l'm thinking about having
a little work done myself.
The other day,
I got out the shower,
and I bent down
to reach for a towel,
and I felt a sharp pain
in my chest.
Shot through my chest
and up around my back,
down my spine.
I thought, ''Oh, Lord.''
I thought I was dying.
I bent over and looked,
and I was standing
on my own titty.
You ain't have to get
no breast reduction.
Just be more careful.
- Both feet too.
Both feet on it.
-
All right, what the hell
you old hens cackling about ?
You ready to go ?
No, not quite.
I'll be ready in a minute.
She still got to set up
a few more minutes.
Have some more wine, girl.
Ooh, girl,
I don't know if I should.
I already had two glasses.
Oh, go on, live a little.
Make your hair look better.
-
-
- Have mercy.
- Yeah,just like lfigured.
You sit up here all day,
getting sloshed and talking
about us men.
- Clesius, have you ever heard
the expression, ''mercy hump'' ?
- Say what ?
'Cause that's whatyou been
getting all theseyears--
mercy humps.
- Stop it.
- You out your goddamn mind.
Let me tell you something.
He ain't got nothing
but a limp doodle.
Oops.
Sorr.
-
- Gotta get ya.
Clesius !
Oh, look whatyou've done! Oh.
- Ah--
- You girls are crazy.
I'm leaving.
Oh, Clesius, Clesius, wait !
Clesius ! Oh, Clesius !
I don't believe it.
Clesius, I only told her 'cause
she got so much experience
in sexual matters.
I ain't nothing but a big
damn joke to you, ain't I ?
Tell the whole world !
Her husband ain't nothing
but a big ol' pile
ofworthless crap !
Clesius !
Clesius !
Oh.
~~~~~~
I'm just glad they're
back in town so you can
fii nally meet them.
I'm extremely nervous
because I really want to
make a good impression.
Sherman, there's no reason
foryou to be nervous.
My parents are ver
down-to-earth people,
and they're gonna love you.
I guess it's not like
they're rocket scientists.
Well, actually, they are.
- Daddy!
- Sweetheart !
Great to see you.
You must be Sherman, the genius
who's marring my daughter.
I guess that's me.
They think I'm old.
They think I'm worn-out, huh ?
I'm gonna show all of'em.
Screw the golden years.
And here's to youth !
That's some nasty mess.
I don't feel no--
Damn, that was
some nasty stuff !
Oh, I feel as strange as hell.
Oh ! Hey, get your ass--
Who the hell are you ?
Who you put--
It worked.
It worked !
~~~Papa'sgot a brand-newbag~~~
~~~~~~
~~~~~~
Yeah !
Oh, what a beautiful bird.
Oh, Crackers has been
in our family
more than 50 years.
Hmm ? Fifty years.
He's older than I am.
- Sherman, your fly. Your fly.
- Yeah, he can fly all over.
- No, no, no, zip your pants.
-
Oh, my goodness.
Excuse me. I felt--
I felt a little breeze.
So, uh, genomic extractions.
Fascinating.
But the whole concept
ofremoving faultygenes must
haveyou in an ethicalquandary.
.
E-Excuse me. Ethical ?
Oh, yes, ldon't knowmuch
about "Ethicals", to be
perfectly honest withyou.
But the ''Quandar''--
I don't like theJapanese cars.
ldon't like
the EthicalQuandary.
I'm a Volvo man myself.
Well, yeah.
- Oh !
-
-
Sherman is known
as the leading expert
in genomic extractions.
Give us a littlepreviewof
thespeechyou're going to make
at thepress conference.
- Say what now ?
- lknow we wouldnever
be able to keep up,
but is there some way
thatyou could explain it
in layman terms ?
Oh, you'd like me
to explain to you ?
Yes.
Well, I would love to.
I would be honored.
It's really quite simple.
This corn, for instance--
This piece ofcorn here
can represent a strand of DNA.
Andthese little--
the individual--
the bumpy things that go--
The Green Giant
calls them ''niblets.''
Uh, niblets.
These niblets represent
eachgene, andthey determine
everything aboutyou.
For instance, Mrs. Gaines,
let's say ifa person was
to have big titties, like you.
-
Sherman !
- l'm sorry. Big titties.
No, breasts. Scratch it.
Get offyou. On me.
- Now, I have a big ass.
Never mind that.
-
What we're attempting
to do here is to extract
the, uh, the bad, badgenes.
Extract that titty out.
Andass comes out.
Andjust leave
thegoodgenes,
which is ver simple
ifyou think about it.
Just ignore that.
Please ignore those.
Those are the badgenes.
What I'm really tring to do
is go deep, deep down
into the gene structure,
which oftentimes
is much more difficult.
Crackers !
Oh, goodness !
I'm-- I'm so--
so sorr about that.
My pants got caught in the thing
and they pulled it on out.
His wings is
twitching a little bit,
so he's allright.
Buddy Love.
Mr. Love. Leanne Guilford.
Yes, Miss Guilford.
How are you ?
You forgotten we have
an appointment right now ?
I had a hard time getting a cab.
- I'm on my way.
- I'll wait for a few more
minutes and then I'm leaving.
Ver good.
I'll see you soon.
All right.
Yes !
Whoo !
This isgreat!
Sir, uh,
please don't do that.
It's kind ofdangerous.
You work her ! Work her !
Dynamite !
Yeah ! Whoo !
Hey, let me have
a seven and seven.
Coming up.
You about the fii nest-looking
thing I seen in a long time.
Well, thankyou ver much.
You pretty damn foxy
yourself, baby.
A lot ofyoung men
are intimidated
by an older woman.
Is that right ?
Well, let me tell
you something.
You look pretty damn young
to me. In fact, let me
tell you something, baby.
You just about the--
You--
Yeah, you look good.
Pretty fii ne.
Foxy fii ne and young.
Excuse me one second.
Yes, yes, yes.
- Get away from my woman.
- Mind your own business,
Willie.
- What ?
- It's over between us.
Hejust won't accept it.
Willie, she said it's over
between y'all. Besides,
you getting the wrong idea.
Outside. Outside.
I'm tired ofthis shit.
Say what ? Who you pushing?
Not again, Willie.
Willie, what's wrong with you ?
All right,
enough is enough !
This is going too damn far !
You gonna make me have
to put my foot in your ass.
I'm gonna tell you straight up.
I don't wanna have
to hurt you, Pops !
Pops ? I'll ''pop'' your ass.
Would you please put
your clothes back on ?
You'll hurt yourself.
You look like a roast chicken.
That was a lucky shot.
- Okay, that's it.
- Come on, fool.
Get your ass up. Come on.
You're crazy.
What the hell is this ?
Am I supposed to believe
that you know ''bujitsu'' ?
Sayonara, sucker.
All right.
Meter reads 3.90.
Here's 4.00. Keep the dime.
Jerk.
Ah, the lovely Miss Guilford.
Where you on your way to ?
- Home.
- Home ? What do you mean ?
We got business to talk.
All you seem to be is talk.
I'm starting to think
you don't even have a formula.
Oh--
We're gonna stick
with Klump.
Stick with Klump ? I just got
off the phone with my research
people in Langley, Virginia.
They're working out
all the minorkinks. We gonna
have a formula any moment now.
Hey ! Klump's formula sucks !
All right, little man.
I've been
real patient.
- I told you I'd mess you up.
-
Oh, you scared now, huh ?
Bring your little butt
back here.
I'm tired ofyour--
Damn.
He done loosen
my tooth too.
So that's where
Sherman's been hiding it.
Klumpville.
Chunkytown.
Big-ass City.
Clesius. Clesius.
Lord have mercy.
What have you been all evening ?
I've been so worried.
Wait. Don't turn
on the light.
- Leave the light out.
- Oh, Clesius, I'm so sorr
about what happened tonight.
Yeah, well-- Anna,
you remember
when we first met ?
Ofcourse I remember.
Back at the state fair. Why ?
Yeah, the state fair.
You was working
the cotton candy.
Standing looking like an angel.
Had that pink sugar
swirling all around you.
I turned to my brother,
and I said three words,
''Might-y fii ne.''
You must've ate
that night, Clesius.
Yeah, well,
I was interested.
I was interested.
I was damn interested.
Closeyoureyes, Anna.
lgot a little surprise
foryou.
Oh, Clesius.
Oh !
Here lam. l'm ready,
andl'm waiting.
- Oh, that some nasty stuff.
- Okay, what you got for me ?
It wouldn't be
a surprise if I told you.
Oh, you always been
such a sexy devil.
Oh, Clesius,
l'm on fire.
Oh, Clesius !
Hurr, Clesius.
Hurr, Clesius !
Hurr, Clesius.
Hurr. Hurr, Clesius.
Yeah, yeah.
l've been waiting
so long.
Clesius, l'm on fire.
I know
you've been waiting, baby.
- Oh, Clesius,
this is so romantic.
- Yeah, Clesius here now.
I'm on fii re.
Anna Pearl,
Anna Pearl.
Yeah,
I'm gonna put your fii re out.
-
- It's okay, baby.
It's okay.
Anna, it's me.
It's me. It's Clesius.
I'm just young again.
Oh, Lord, Clesius,
what have you done
to yourself?
I took some
ofSherman's youth juice,
and it's incredible.
I got enough
for both of us too.
Damn. Don't worr about it.
I got some more in the garage.
I'm not taking that mess.
I don't want
no magic formula.
- What's wrong with you, woman ?
Don't you wanna be young ?
- No, I don't wanna be young.
Clesius, we're supposed
to be who we are, andl'm
just fine with who lam.
But, obviously,
what you're tring to say
is that you'rejust tired...
ofthe fat, old woman
that you got married to.
Oh, no, Anna.
That's not what I'm saying.
That ain't what I'm saying
at all.
Downstairs. I thinkyou
better sleep downstairs.
Anna, please, no, baby.
- But I wasjust--
- Downstairs, Clesius.
I don't wanna hear it.
Oh, Clesius, I'm so
disappointed in you.
I just feel so
god-awful terrible about
what happened to Crackers.
Imagine what your parents
must think about me.
Sherman, you were acting
really strange tonight.
Yeah, I know, 'cause,
um, I drank that wine,
and I had cold medicine
early on.
And mixing cold medicine
and wine-- that don't mix.
Well, cold medicine
or not,
I'm really worried
about you.
And I really thinkyou
should get a checkup.
All right. I will.
Yeah, I will.
Okay.
Go home
and get some rest,
and fii rst thing in the morning,
I'll make an appointment
to get a checkup.
Good.
See you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
- Sorr about Crackers.
I'm sorr. Okay ?
- Okay. Okay.
Mm.
Pervert.
''Beef in your taco.''
- I'm a pony ! I'm a pony !
- Mommy, I'm scared.
Nowback
to the midnight movie.
A huge asteroid, approximately
is still on
a collision course with Earth.
Wellman College Professor
Sherman Klump...
is attempting to plant
a nuclear explosive device
deep within the asteroid core,
which, ifeffective,
will destroy it.
Houston, come in.
This is Professor Klump
on the asteroid's surface.
We readyou, Professor.
What'syourstatus ?
We've done dug the hole
and planted the nukes.
Good. Then get back
in your shuttle and get
the hell out ofthere...
so you can blow
that rock to bits.
Sherman, you've got 30 seconds
before that asteroid hits.
Better hurr.
The world's counting on it.
Fifteen seconds.
Sherman, start
the detonation sequence now.
Hello, Houston.
We got a big-assproblem.
Sherman, you've
got to blow up the asteroid.
Press that button !
I... can't... reach it.
Sherman.
Sherman, I am your father.
Search your feelings, Sherman.
There's a force
deep down inside you. Use it.
Use your force, Sherman.
Ofcourse.
Ah, yes.
The force is strong
with you, my son.
-
Goddamn.
- What the hell was that noise ?
Whew ! I think something
crawled up your force
and died, Sherman.
-~~~~~~
-
Ten seconds to impact.
My God !
He didn 'tplant those charges
on the asteroid.
Then where didheplant them ?
Okay.
Good-bye, Mr. Asteroid.
This isgonna begood. Yeah.
Wait a minute.
Didllandon the wrong--
Oh, shit.
Oh, no. I done blowed up
the wrong one.
Good-bye, Sherman.
Denise, please don't--
It was an accident.
Denise--
l'm sure it'lljust make
a little splash in the ocean.
That's all.
See,just a little, tiny--
Oh, that ain 't tiny
at all, is it ?
I am an idiot.
Oh, thankyou,
Granny, so much.
You are too sweet.
Yeah, that's
a little specialpresent
foryour wedding night.
Oh, fabulous.
Romantic and fabulous.
Oh, Mama !
Ooh !
Thankyou, Granny.
Maybesomething l wouldn 't have
chosen formyself. Thankyou.
Well, I didn't choose it
foryou, baby.
I got it for Sherman.
He'sgonna be the one
that'sgonna appreciate
the hell out ofit, trust me.
Girls, lgottago check on
the rest ofmysurprise.
Y'all excuse me fora moment.
Girls, lsawthe most
fabulousgame the otherday.
lt's calledBachelorette Bingo.
Let'splay.
Oh, this is so fabulous !
This is Miss Ida MaeJensen.
I'm calling to confii rm
a male stripper fantasy,
the Muy Caliente
Vida Loca special.
Goddamn.
Yeah, that's right.
Well, where they at ?
We all ready here. Now--
Oh, never mind.
lsee him
overhere now. Okay.
Yes, we will enjoy.
Thankyou.
Now, that's what lcall

ElNegro special.
Mmm-mmm !
- Hey.
-
Well, hello there,
stripper man.
Now, you know, lordered
thespecial, andyousupposed
to be dressedasa fireman.
Stripperman ?
Oh, stripper--
Oh, yes, stripperman.
Well, I, um--
I decided not to do
my fii reman dance tonight,
because last time I did it,
things got so heated up,
kind ofscorched my suit.
So I decided to do
my cat burglar dance. And
I slip through the back door...
and I'm kind of poking around,
'cause I'm a method stripper...
and I want to get

like Ken Norton in Mandingo.
Oh, really ?
Oh, Ken Norton-- Oh, Mandingo.

Well, thankyou so much.
Thankyou. Thankyou.

You wanna slow down ?
Stop, stop, stop !
I'm gonna need

You want a private dance.
Okay, I can do that.
But fii rst, um, I'm so thirsty.
I got a craving for some--
for some red fruit punch.
Red fruit punch ?
I ain't seen none

Oh, there may be
some in the garage ?
Well, after I quench my thirst,
I'm gonna come

Ow !

You like that, don't you ?
Yeah, that's like Soul Train.
That's la vida loca.
Make this face here
like I'm tearing it up.
Oh, good Lord.
Oh, my precious Lord.
You like that ?
Don't move now.
I ain't going nowhere. I'll be
right here for the Soul Train.

- For the Soul Train !
I'll be right back.
Oh, my goodness,

Yes, ma'am,
I'm afraid there is.

Chunky Butt made this
a nice, easy task forme.
Yes, yes, yes.
Perfect. Now I gotta fii nd
something to cut this with.
Maybe a little
fertilizer or something.
Oh, this is gonna
be perfect, Chunky Butt.

I just came down foryour
big presentation. You're
not nervous, are you ?
No, I ain't nervous.
''No, I ain't.''
''No, I ain't.''
That's interesting.
Starting to sound
kind of ignorant.
But don't worr.
Ifthis professor thing
don't work out,
there's always room
for another brother
down at the car wash.
They could put a big
beach towel on your ass,
and you can stand
in the doorway
as the cars come out...
and dr 'em
a side at a time.
That's your future.
Buddy, I notice
since the split-up...
that, uh, I ain't really--
I haven't really felt
like myself.
I was wondering ifyou've been
experiencing any changes.
Not at all.
I feel great. Never
felt better in my life.
Business is really starting

andPetey is four.
Petey is our candidate for
genetic ''transmografiication.''
Petey here--
Petey is ourcandidate
forgenetic "transmofilectesy. "
Genetic ''transgromanation.''
The "youthification--"
That ain 't a word.
Howcome Uncle Sherman's

- He's starting
to sound like you, Dad.
- He don't sound right, do he ?
What do you mean,
''sound like me'' ? What's that ?
Sherman up in a ivor tower...
just 'cause
he went to college.
I could've gone to college
if I took that damn...
elastic ''appitude'' test.
Hey, shut up.
What the hell's
wrong with Sherman ?
You be breaking me down
in front of my seed
on the regular.
The reason we, uh-- he--
We gonna make him young.
So I say, um,
let's get it on !
I'm gonna just give

my babyseeing that.
- That man ain't never
gonna be right again.
- Oh !
- Somebody need to take
Isaac's pressure.
- Oh, what's wrong with this ?
- Something like that
will ruin a man.
- Coverthe baby's eyes.
That's too much
excitement for my baby.
Turn the channel.
- I can't even turn.
- That's nasty.
- That's what that is.
Turn the baby's eyes.
Andhe don't needto know
what it is, Mama.
Now, was that
supposed to happen ?
lt's the lovely Miss Guilford.
Mr. Love.
What a wonderful day
we're having, huh ?
Why am I not surprised
to see you here ?
Well, I fii gured since it
turns out that Professor Klump
ain't your man after all,
you might wanna talk
a deal.
All right.
Have your formula ready
for presentation on Friday.
Friday it is.
See you Friday.
Lovely dress.
Mm-hmm.
I'll wear
something sharp.
Oh, Dean. I'm just
tring to fii gure out
what went wrong here.
I just don't understand.
It must've been some sort
ofcontaminant or something.
The deal with Phleer is off.
I just spoke to
Leanne Guilford.
But that
doesn 't botherme.
After all,
what's $1 50 million ?
Oh !
Dean Richmond,
I am so sorr.
I'm really tring to get
to the bottom ofthis, because
this was not supposed to happen.
No, that's not
what bothers me.
Deals will come
and deals will go.
Wellman...
will always be Wellman.
But I'll tell you
what does bother me.
On the way over here,
a cute little boy
pointed at me and said,
''Oh, look, Mommy, there
goes the hamster's bitch !''
Uh--
Dean, whatever it's worth,
Petey is back to normal
and feelingjust fii ne.
Oh, yeah ?
- Do you think he'll call ?
-
Dean, I just want to tell you,
I'm-- I'm sorr.
Stop... speaking !
I just want to go
on record as saying that--
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh.
I've been looking forward
to saying something to you
for 1 2 years.
And here it is.
You're fat !
- And dumb.
-
And fii red.
Sherman.
It's not your fault.
I ain't never--
I'm never gonna be
the same again, am I ?
I'm afraid not.
Sinceyou've separated
brain cells have been damaged.
yourspeech andmemory--
lknow.
l'llbe a totalidiot.
Don't you think it's
time you told Denise ?
Oh, no,Jason.
I can't do that.
How can I tell her
I'm losing the ver thing...
that made her fall in love
with me in the fii rst place ?
Mm-mmm.
Hi.
Sherman,
what areyou doing here ?
How you doing ?
Your mama told me I might
be able to fii nd you here.
I've been looking all over
the place foryou. I've been
leaving messages everwhere.
I went by your place.
Yeah, well, I had
a lot on my mind.
You know, I walk around,
going around,
getting time to think.
I wonder if I can talk
to you about something.
Look, I know you're upset
about what happened.
But we can get right back
to work with the youth formula,
and I think
the problem--
No, not science.
Denise, I'm not--
This isn't about science.
We can start completely over.
We can fii nd another university.
After the wedding,
we can even--
That's what I'm talking
about-- the wedding.
Denise, I don't think
there's going to be a wedding.
Well, not--
not right away anyway.
I mean, my head'sjust kind
of messed up right now,
and I don't think
it'd be fair to you.
What ?
I made a mistake.
And I have to work
that mistake out.
I have to live with that.
Me, not you.
See, you're so pretty,
and you're so smart.
You just got
your whole life
ahead ofyou.
I just don't want
to mess things up
foryou. I'm--
I'm sorr, Denise.
I think
I'd better get going.
You allright ?
Oh, ljust don't
understand, Clesius.
And he won't tell me why.
Anna, listen.
Sometimes a man do some
crazy things, you know ?
Oh !
Not that he's tring to hurt
nobody. He's not tring to
tell you he don't love you.
It'sjust--
Sometimes you get
kind ofconfused,
you know ?
You hear
what I'm saying ?
Yes, Clesius,
I hear what you're saying.
I'll talk to the boy.
Everthing
was so fabulous.
You cut out
that cring now.
It's all right.
Stop all that cring.
Go clean your nose up.
Go wash your hands.
Snot all over the place
looking nasty as hell.
What's this on me ? Goddamn,
look what you put on me, Anna.
What's this on me for ?
Yeah, you know
something, Sherman ?
The ver fii rst building
I ever worked on was
on this site right here.
Yep.
Isn't that something ?
It was a baker.
Yeah.
Tore it down
two years ago.
Thirty-fiive years later,
I wind up working on
the thing,
building it up
all over again;
ain't that something ?
I expected the building
I worked on was permanent.
But I was wrong,
'cause it ain't.
That's not permanent.
You know what's
permanent, Sherman ?
You know
what's permanent ?
I'm gonna tell you.
What me
and your mama got.
That's permanent.
That ain't
going no place.
You know what I mean ?
Ifyou get you
a woman that really,
really loves you,
you've got to hold on
to that, Sherman.
Yeah, that's true, Daddy.
Yeah, I knows I sure
do love Denise.
Well, then y'all gotta
get back together then.
Get back together ?
Daddy, that's it.
Yeah.
Get back together.
Ifwe get back together,
that'll make everthing okay.
Dynamite. Go call the girl.
Say what ?
Not Denise. Buddy.
Me and Buddy get back together,
that'll make everthing fii ne
between me and Denise.
Hey, you just took
the wrong off-ramp.
I can use the youth formula.
I'll feed it to Buddy.
It'll make him so young.
I'll turn him back into Goop.
And I ingest-- I eat it !
I eat it !
Huh ?
That's it.
Daddy, that'll work.
I wouldn't have even
thought about that.
This is fantastic !
What are you gonna eat ?
Sherman ! Damn !
Hello, Sherman.
lheardyou were here.
Give me a minute, Dean,
and I'll be on my way.
Trespass allyou like.
- It goes so well in court
with grand theft.
- I beg your pardon.
You're tring to sell
the youth formula
under a different identity.
Who do you thinkyou are ?
Dean, you just don't
understand, really.
That's always possible.
Then help me out if
you don't mind. Explain it.
Why is Buddy Love
meeting with Phleer ?
Oh, my goodness.
I gotta hurr up.
Not so fast, pal.
I'm not letting you
out of my sight until both
our names are on that contract.
I'm going to be stuck on you
like a giant hamster on my a--
Where you go, I go.
I have no time to stand
here and argue with you.
Ifyou wanna come along,
I'll explain it to you
on the way.
Ladies andgentlemen
anddistinguishedguests,
it is showtime.
Now I'd like to present
to you exhibit ''A.''
His name is Zeke,
and it is ver clear...
that Zeke has been getting
his ass whipped by Father Time
for many, many years.
Oh, my God, Sherman.
Sherman ! Sherman !
Sherman !
- Hey, hey, hey, Denise.
- Thank God.
What the hell's
going on ?
Papa Klump,
have you seen Sherman ?
He's in trouble.
Oh, tell me about it.
First the boy acting crazy and
called off the wedding. Then he
talking about eating some guy.
I don't know
if it's something I need
to talk to the boy about.
Wait. Eating somebody ?
Yeah, he said he's
gonna eat some man.
Ofcourse. Buddy.
Yeah, that's the guy.
What's going on between
the three ofy'all ?
- What's this, a kind
of menage a trois ?
- I know where Sherman is.
Ladies and gentlemen,
ifZeke dropped dead right now,
who would care ?
- I would.
- My point exactly.
Exactly. That no person,
no matter who they are,
no matter how hopelessly
disgusting their case may be,
should be left
without a second chance.
Andthat is why l wouldlike
to introduce... New You,
a fully copyrighted product
being offered to you...
by thegoodpeople
ofLove Enterprises.
Now, ifyou'd be so kind,
Zeke, would you drink
this up, please ?
It's kind
of like Mogen David,
but fruitier.
Wait !
l'm sorry to interrupt,
ladies andgentlemen !
But I cannot go on living
unless I have this man
inside me right now.
- Steady, sailor.
- What the hell
is going on here ?
Well, if it isn't Professor
Sherman Klump, the inventor
ofJumbo the Horny Hamster.
- Please !
- Buddy, I am sick
and I am tired...
ofyour s-h--
"l. "
Thankyou. T-E.
My shite ? Oh, really ?
Well, what you gonna
do about it, Shamu ?
- Tell you what I'm gonna do.
- I don't have no time to play
no games with your ass.
- You got time to play
a little catch, don't you ?
- Oh, you bastard.
Buddy.
- Aw !
-
Buddy, Buddy. Buddy.
Get it, Buddy. Buddy !
Na, na, na, na.
Hey, Buddy. Fetch.
Aach !
What the hell is that ?
Who's dumb now ?
Oh, Sherman.
Oh, you sneaky
son ofa bitch.
Oh, Sherman !
Oh, no !
Oh, shit !
Uh-- ah-- ah--
Everbody calm down.
This is a part
ofthe demonstration.
Just calm-- Relax.
Everything's undercontrol.
What the hellareyou
looking at ?
This is an impressive
package for a toddler.
All right, Mr. Toddler.
Nothing to see here, folks.
This mutant is about
to dissolve into liquid,
and then the fat man is going
to suck him through a straw.
Sorry, Buddy.
ljust want my life back.
You don't owe him
any explan-- What ?
Come here.
Oh, you rotten
son ofa-- Oh !

- Forget it, fat ass.
I ain't going back
inside ofyou.
Mmm. Got milk ?
Thankyou, baby.
He's getting away.
Dean, I want that formula.
Bring me the man who made it.
I'm ready to make a deal.
Hmm ? Right.
I'm naked ! I'm naked !
I'm naked ! I'm naked !
I'm naked !
- There he is.
- What the hell is happening ?
-
-
What the hell
was that ?
Buddy.
All right, that's it.
Slow the car down !
Slow down !
We can't help Sherman
wrapped around no light pole.
We've got to get to him.
He and Buddy have to be
combined immediately.
Where's the little snot now ?
-  What the hell
are you looking at ?
-  Come on.
What ? What ?
Don't feel right.
Starting to feel
a little light-headed.
Ifyou quit now, you're
gonna be empty-headed.
Come on, Klump. Let's get him.
Get ahold ofthis, chubby.
Whoo !
You got a big ass !
- What ?
- Follow that ass.
Aw, hell.
Now, what's all ofthis ?
- Move out the way, damn it !
- Wait a minute.
I think I see him.
Goddamn.
Oh, no.
Don't even thinkabout it.
Don'tyou do it.
Oh, you're doing it.
- Ow !

All right, tubby.
Let's see how long

What ? What ?
That's it ?
He's gone ?
Ah, I-I-- da-da--
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
Oh, that's marvelous.
The deal is dead,
you know that ?
I've been calling you

Now you're fii nally--

Sherman.
You okay ?
Gone-- he's all gone.
Buddy ?
He evaporated ?
Gone. And me no smart.
Never. No more.
Sherman, that's okay.
I mean, we'll fii gure
something out.
There has to be something
that we can do.
I want to say
I'm-- I'm sorr.
I never--
I didn't want to hurt you.
You understand ?
I thought that ifyou knew
that Buddy was a part of me,
I thought that you
wouldn't have me then.
Sherman.
Now, hear me.
Hear me out now.
I should've had
more faith in you.
Should've had
more faith in myself.
But I--
Sherman.
Sherman,
what's wrong ?
Sherman ?
- Can't you hear, son ?
- Sherman, look at me.
Who am I ?
Pretty lady.
Oh, honey.
