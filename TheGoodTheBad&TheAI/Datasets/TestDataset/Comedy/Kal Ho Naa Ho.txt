New York... one of the biggest cities
in the world
Business capital of the world.
Every breath of the city... every
heartbeat is filled with speed
People are always in a hurry here...
in a hurry to leave home... in a hurry
to reach the office...
always in a hurry to be a
step or two ahead of life
There is no place for anyone
who can't cope here
Miles away from India, this city
is infested with Indians
In fact they say every fourth face
in New York is an Indian
One more thing...
Oh... by the way that's mel
This city taught me
to be independent...
it taught me to fulfill
my responsibilities...
taught me to face life...
...but it couldn't teach me to love...
where was the time?
Whenever I watched the
city from far...
I felt Papa was closer
Whenever I missed him,
I came here
I am Naina Catherine Kapur
and this is my story
I understand Mr. Shah,
but try and understand my problem
I must have the loan extension, please.
I know the restaurant
is centrally situated.
But there's competition
around, Mr. Shah...
My mother, Jennifer.
After Papa passed away...
the entire responsibility
of the family fell on her
But she never allowed us to ever
feel the burden of her sorrows
Thank you... l.
- I'm home.
Where were you?
Central Park
Central Park? Why?
To meet someone.
- Who?
To meet my boyfriend...
Bill... bills... bills
Private & confidential.
That's mine.
What is this?
It's Sweetu's mail again
When will the mailman understand
that we are Kapur with a 'U'...
and they are Kapoor with an 'O'?
He always...
Were you crying?
No... you were crying...
No mom.
My mother and I...
We lied to each other everyday
Kunwari kudi
Kunwari kudi marriage bureau,
what's this?
Why don't you ask your grandmother?
It must some new plan
to find you a groom
But I don't want to get married...
Why doesn't Dadi leave me alone?
Why doesn't she just leave?
Mom! Where's she?
It's going to be eight...
Hi Guys, 10 seconds to go.
My grandmother Lajjo...
She had three dreams
One that New York
becomes a part of Punjab
Two, that I marry a Sardar
and three... that my mother dies
Saraswatiji, Lata, Asha and Usha have
served you with their music for years
But from today Kammo,
Vimmo and I, Lajjo...
Hello! Will serve you.
So without delay further we are
going to present you a song
The words are 'Pritam come hither... '
The song is specially requested by
our neighbour, Chaddaji from Queens...
That's very kind of you
Kammo... Vimmo...
Go Lajjo...
"Pritam, come hither..."
"Pritam, come hither..."
"My sad heart calls out to you..."
"Pritam, come hither...
Come hither... Come hither..."
Dadi! Stop it.
Oh God! Interrupted our prayers?
Insulted the goddess?
Don't you have any shame?
Singing 'Come hither'
'Come hither' to Chaddaji?
Who's singing it to Chaddaji?
We are singing 'Pritam, come hither'
What is his first name?
- Pritam...
And what is this?
What? - This.
Wow! Pictures from Kunwari Kudi!
All three of them are so goodlooking
Three? They look
like the same guy
No, no my child...
they are different
Now what is that Kunwari kudi ad?
"Hey girl, Hey Girl, hey Girl...
choose your groom and be free"
"Choose one, two or three"
Dadi, I am not interested in marrying
anyone... one two or three
If you don't marry, my child,
how will you have children?
I can have my children.
There's no need to marry
My brother Shiv, a handicap.
He couldn't play basketball
like the other boys...
but he could be quite irritating
like the other boys
Shiv, put off the T.V.
Whenever I see,
it's always basketball!
Just because I can't play
doesn't mean I can't see...
Don't get cute with me.
All right. Hurry up.
Gia, help your brother.
Didi, did you see my new dolls?
- Gia!
This is Mama, this is you...
this is bhaiyya, this is me and...
Oh, so you are awake...!
Looking so good...
like Hari Putter...
Harry Potter, dadi...
Ya ya... whatever... Hari, Harry...
Good morning, dadi.
- Ya Ya...
What's your schedule today?
Dadi's love for Shiv was only
matched by her hatred for Gia
Gia was adopted and probably that's why
Dadi did not consider her, our own
And Gia... She always kept the
Dadi doll away from her perfect family
Distance was not just
between the two in the family...
Guru Nanak and Jesus had
their own battle in the house
It's so cold! Is the heater on?
You are always on, aren't you?
What? - Nothing!
Will it? - Shut up.
Bet? - Don't irritate me.
Chicken is just 1 dollar.
What's for breakfast?
- Fruit and cereal
What? - Cereal...
Has it started? The serial
Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki...?
Not the TV serial...
the cereal we eat
So what's new?
That we eat everyday
Poor daughter-in-law... she doesn't
know how to make Indian food
Our dear daughter-in-law, Jenny
Do you know, Naina?
I saw a lovely dream last night
In the dream, I was eating
hot aloo parathas...
with lots of white butter
Oh... how I missed Chandigarh!
If you miss Chandigarh so much
then you must go away there
What do you think Naina?
I'm going nowhere. If I leave,
what will happen to these children?
I'm very concerned about them
And I'm concerned only about them
Yes of course... why would
you be concerned about me?
Who am I to you?
If only my son was alive today...
Only if he was alive...
Stop it. Just stop it.
Here's your dollar. You won.
As usual, are you happy now?
And both of you... just forget it.
My morning began
this same way everyday
Mama and Dadi's fight,
followed by my angry walkout...
and then listening to my stupid
neighbour, Sweetu's stupid chatter
Oh Hi! - One minute.
Okay, make that 2 glaced doughnuts,
And what will you have?
Sweetu. Full name, Jasprit Kapoor...
Kapoor with two 'o's.
My neighbour...
& unfortunately best friend.
She has two problems.
The weight that she never loses...
and the fact that she
never feels sad about it
Tell, Na...
- One double expresso please.
Here's your letter.
It came again to our house
Your name had to be J. Kapoor...
Oh wow Naina! Blind date application.
- What application?
It's a very cool service...
it's very popular in New York
Just fill in a form describing
the guy of your choice...
write something about yourself...
they match the details and bingo,
you get the guy...!
Wow! And what have you written
about yourself?
See Naina, I have written
what's the truth... what is... is
What did you write?
That from far,
I look like Aishwarya Rai...
And up close,
like Aishwarya Rai's house
Oh my god!
- Just look at me...
Oh my god! Just look at him
Look at me. I'm out of control.
- He's so cute.
Sweetu, look at me...
- I see you everyday...
He's so cute...
- Shut up... shut up.
Boys, boys boys...
That's all you are interested in
What will happen?
You will get the boy you want...
you will get married, you will
have his children and then...
he will leave all of you and go away
What will you do then?
What will you do?
I will marry again... What else?
Forget it. Just...
Naina, what Didi says is right...
Babes! You need help.
You & your Didi!
Bloody... Eating all our business!
Jazz... Full name Jaswinder Kapoor
Sweetu's elder sister
and unfortunately...
Mama's best friend and
restaurant partner
She had problems too
Youth, that she is desperately
holding on to...
and age that she refuses to accept
Oh customers!
- Coming up.
Thanks... mummy.
Look, I said I'm sorry Jenny.
It's okay.
- It's not okay.
With great difficulty,
we have four or five customers coming in
Thanks to you, if they run away,
what are we going to do?
Listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.
You know very well that if we don't
return the loan from the bank...
on time we will have
to leave this place
Then, what are we going to do.
I mean what...
Oh god! This rain.
I hate this rain.
Opps! Sorry. That's my friend.
I forgot to mention about him
Meet Rohit Patel.
Son of Karsanbhai & Sarlabhen Patel.
Karsanbhai was one of the
richest Gujaratis in America
His food chain was quite popular
in the whole country
Name: Dial a Dhokla
Rohit lived alone in New York
As for work, in the last three years
he had made no progress
Hi guys. Have fun.
Yes, Thank you. - Good.
Okay. So, if I can get this file
with this...
Ah Julia!
Dinner at 8?
Dinner at 8... 8... Dinner
Dinner at 8 - Yeah.
All right. I'm going to
pick you up at 7.30.
Poor Rohit... he wasn't as cool
as he thought he was
But...
He never stopped trying.
Hey Gorgeous!
- Are you talking to me?
Who else? You think I was talking
to this rhino here?
My name is Rohit
Don't bother. I'm married
- So what?
So what if you are married...
...to him
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
- Put him down.
I don't even like her.
- Put him down.
Bye, take care.
So that's Rohit Patel.
How do I know him?
For the last one year...
I have been studying with him
in the evening MBA classes
Sorry, I'm late. - Walk.
What happened? - Nothing
I was coming down in the lift and...
I understood...
What's the girl's name?
I don't know.
- Husband hit you or boyfriend?
Husband... - What was his name?
Hari Prasad Chaurasia...
How do I know? Husband's name...
Oh Rohit... I'm feeling so bad...
- It's ok...
...that he didn't hit you more...
- Thanks.
How was your weekend?
Fantastic! I went to London
and Paris...
It shows. Anyway my
weekend was rocking
Laila and I. In the same room...
on the same bed... all weekend
You know what I mean.
- Oh please.
Oh... Ah Laila, stop it. Not there.
Stop it. No. Stop it.
Listen. Will you
Laila, no...
Thank God you are not like the
other girls in New York
You are neither sexy, nor beautiful
and you always have time for me
I like you. - Thanks Rohit.
Thanks Rohit... if it wasn't
for you, I would have died
Jerk!
Gita Patekar, New entry.
Today is her first day. Divorcee,
for God's sake leave her alone
Hi! - Hi!
Please sit - where?
I'd say in my heart... but for now...
right here behind me.
Sick!
DINNER AT 9.
Please don't, okay.
I wonder what Rohit wrote
in his black diary...
I never asked him about it...
He is mad
When I met him the first time,
I didn't like him at all
But today, he's my friend...
a very close friend
Basically, he's a nice guy and
this I can vouch for... you know why?
Because that night
he did not cancel his date
To you.
Rohit Patel, I forget about all
my household problems when I meet him.
Are you all right, my son?
Hope you are not hurt... - Sorry, dadi.
What sorry? Can't you see?
What if my Shiv had got hurt?
What are you doing?
She's just a child...
Child? You have spoilt her
It's her duty to
take care of her brother
And yours, to forgive...
not to raise your hand
I haven't been able to forgive you...
so who's she?
Forgive me? What have I done?
- Forget it...
No no... please say...
what wrong have I done?
Listen... Just keep quiet...
The same comment everyday!
Please blurt it out today
Don't make me open my mouth
Why are you scared? Please say...
It's because of you that my son...
Dadi... Enough!
The fact that was known all these years
but never spoken about...
was mentioned today
Papa's death was not incidental
He had taken his own life...
he commited suicide
The truth is always bitter.
No one knows the truth.
Not even you
Stop it Gia... stop it...
Don't cry now...
She hates me.
- No darling, she doesn't hates you.
She hates you.
Don't say that...
she's angry now...
everything will be alright
When will everything be alright, Mama?
Do you know, when I was young...
I used to cry over little things.
My mother used to tell me...
that Jesus sends his angel
to all of us to wipe our tears
Angel? - Angel darling, Angel!
Our angel will come...
he will wipe our tears
He will give us lots of happiness...
and will leave our sorrow
somewhere far away
When will our angel come?
Let's do one thing
Today, in our prayers let's ask
Jesus for our angel... OK?
Dear god, if you're listening.
Please bring some light into
these dark times... A little light...
And suddenly the season changed...
no one knows how, but moving
aside the gloomy clouds...
the sun smiled on all of us
Come on, he's open... He's open.
Come on.
What are you doing guys?
Want to come & teach me, you shit.
If I could play,
I'd surely have played
Hello boy, Hello girl, Hello doll.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
No, I'm sorry.
I'm Aman... Hello.
Mama has said not to talk to...
str... str... stranglers...
Not stranglers, silly... Strangers
But I'm not a stranger.
I live in that opposite house
Wrong. That stupid Chadda uncle
lives there
I know... That's my uncle
You made a Boo boo.
Yes, he made a boo boo. It's okay.
I know he's a little stupid...
and I have also heard that he has
something on with a silly old hag here
That's our grandmother
Oops! I made a - Boo Boo
I'm sorry.
By the way, what's
your grandmother's name?
Grandmother! - What a nice name!
Listen to us poor... and God will
hear your prayers
Oh wow! What's this?
Beggars in New York?
Those are not beggars...
That's our grandmother!
Oh! I'm sorry for you.
I'll do something about it
Best of luck.
"Listen to us poor... and God will
hear your prayers"
"You give us a dollar and
He will give you ten lakhs"
Grandma! Grandma!
Oh Lajjoji...
He has heard our prayers!
Who? - He...
Grandma! Oh Grandma...
Jennifer Lopez!
Spice Girls... here... here...
What's the matter? We were
praying to Goddess Saraswati!
You were not praying to Saraswati...
you were torturing her!
Now... Saraswati can't come here
herself so on her behalf I beg you...
Please don't sing!
What?
What do you mean 'what'?
Just look at them... these young
children who are playing here...
it will have such a bad effect on them
They will lose faith in music!
And who are you to say
all these things to us?
I'm sorry I forgot
to introduce myself...
I'm Aman Mathur,
your new neighbour...
and Chaddaji's nephew
Chadda's nephew?
Lajjoji... Don't mind.
My nephew is a bit mischevious!
Hmmm... Chadda and
Lajjo's love story...
doesn't care about age
and blooms in glory...
She's quite sexy!
Chadda! - Lajjo.
Lajjoji... don't shout
so much at this age
If you do, it's straight...
If you guys are so fond of singing,
I will come and teach you
Tell me... When do I play you guys...?
Chadda! He doesn't even know
how to speak
What's happening here? What's this
noise so early in the morning!
Specsy!
He comes to our locality
and stops us from singing?
We were singing so well and he says
we don't know how to sing...
He must be that Chadda's relative...
- Let's speak to him...
"I saw someone moments ago..."
"who is that girl?"
"The more I look at her..."
"the more I wonder..."
"what may I say to her?"
Hit it.
"I saw someone moments ago..."
"who is that girl?"
"Is she a bud...? Is she a ray...?"
"Or is she part of a legend?"
"The more I look at her,
the more I wonder..."
"what may I say to her?"
"Pretty Woman..."
"Look... Pretty Woman"
"Say with me... Pretty Woman"
"Ya Pretty Woman!"
"Listen up, girl...
you're feeling this way"
"Don't you see the sunshine
coming up today?"
"You got to feel it right,
just like day after night"
"Don't let the sunshine
out of your sight"
"I can feel you..."
"I'm crazy about you.
Pretty Woman"
"The colour of gold..."
"the colour of crystal..."
"the sight leaves me breathless...
I'm amazed"
"What trait is this...?"
"Why're there so much of pride...?"
"What secret is it...?
How will I say it"
"Happy in a moment and angry too..."
"she changes colours every moment"
"But when I look at her,
I find her oh so beautiful"
"The more I look at her..."
"the more I wonder..."
"what may I say to her?"
"Pretty Woman..."
"Go for it!"
"Her eyes hold an intoxication..."
"Her tresses are ike the clouds..."
"such trait, O lovely one,
I had never seen"
"I see this fairy..."
"it brings my heart alive..."
"isn't this a spell being a cast?"
"I know not her name,
nor where she lives..."
"but this much I surely know"
"The one she casts a look at
will surely go crazy"
"The more I look at her
the more I wonder..."
"what may I say to her?"
"Pretty Woman..."
"Look... Pretty Woman"
"Say with me... Pretty Woman"
Gia!
Sorry... sorry.
Hello! Hi, I'm Aman.
I know. Everyone heard it this morning
I never knew that
Chaddasaab had a nephew!
Even I didn't know that my uncle's
neighbours are so beautiful! - What?
I was talking about your mother!
Jennifer right!
Jennifer you're very very very beautiful.
- Thank you.
Let me say this.
This is shiv, Basket ball champ.
And this is my sweet heart Gia.
And you're...
- Not interested.
That shows on your face
Anyway, It's very to nice meet
the rest of you.
Nice to meet you too.
- Thank you.
Do you know Aman?
I saw so much colour together in
our street for the first time today?
I know. It's a boring sort of a street.
But don't worry. Now that I am here...
Just see what happens in future!
You must have come here
on important business
No, not at all.
Just to get married! - Really!
Jennifer, I want to marry your daughter!
- What?
Do you mind?
I'm talking to Gia.
Gia, my sweet heart
will you marry me?
Yeah... please... - No... no.
Doesn't matter...
Just one thing... is she in
a bad mood or was she born this way?
She has always been like this
- Don't say like that.
Please don't mind her.
- No... no, not at all.
This is a childhood problem.
Anyway, lovely to meet you all.
I will see you guys at about 7 or 8...
At your place...
I'm your new neighbour
Obviously you will invite us to
show your hospitality... won't you?
Okay.
Okay... okay... okay.
Actually not 7... at 8...
I'm a bit busy...
and after I go she will be
angry with you.
...for inviting me to dinner
But don't worry...
it's a childhood problem
She won't say any such thing
Where was the need
to invite him for dinner?
Yes... What was the need?
One minute weren't you there?
I did not invite him...
he invited himself
I tell you Lajjoji...
Our Mrs. Sharma was telling me...
Who? - From Kunwari Kudi...
She was saying that
these young goodlooking
boys come from India...
and take our girls for a ride...
Ride? For what?
For a card... - Ya... ration card
Oh Shut up. For a Green card...
what else?
Lord! Did you hear that?
Lord, please protect us
Oh forget it aunty.
It's just one guy...
I can handle an entire army
I'm inviting Sweetu
and Rohit for dinner
Rohit? A boy! - Is he single?
He's a boy... he's single
and he is Gujarati
Gujarati! - They are vegetarians
Relax dadi.
He's a close friend.
Just like Sweetu. - Sweetu?
What? I was getting ready
for my blind date!
Blind date? - Oh! A date with a blind boy
No wonder she has
blindfolded herself!
Blind date means a date with
a boy who has never seen me
And when he sees, he will
be blinded with shock
How rude is that?
Anyway Naina, I can't come
tonight bye all.
Bye ball make your call.
I'm coming... Wait for me.
Hey Naina. - Hey Rohit.
What's up?

You took so much time
Go and ask supermarket.

Let me help, close the door darling.
Not so much... it's too much...
I said I'd do it, Jenny...
Thank you. - What's the need...?
What have I done? I'm just
impressing my mother-in-law
What do you say?
You're very sweet.
- You're also very sweet.
I know her
I forgot to tell you...
Rohit had called
He said he would be

Mr. Mathur - Yeah darling.
Don't call me darling.
Then call me Aman.

Even you have the same problem
Why are you following me?
Don't you have anything to do?
The restaurant accounts

How's it so bad?
How dare you, it's
my private affair.
Let me look.
I'm sorry my son is

Indian Food! I'm sure Jenny hasn't made it

Congratulations on getting
a new servant!
Congratulations on getting
a new son-in-law!
Keep the change.
Your father must be a waiter!
Waiter, where's the party?
Excuse me, I'm looking
for No.29 - 27.
Oh my darling son...
you must eat all the Indian food
that's cooked today...

Dadi... - I said I'll get it
O hello. - Hello!

His name is...
Guru Guru Guru...
C'mon, get started
Who is Guru? - You 'Guru'...
Forget it... Tell me where

I live in Jackson heights
First I had my den in Mumbai...
I left Mumbai and took an
entry into US... What say?
Absolutely fit bhai! Wanna have
chicken? Naina's made it.
Who's Naina? - That one...
Specsy
Who else lives in your
house? - Where? - Home?
At home... there's mummy,
I and Master...
You mean your father...?
- Master is a dog!
Never say such things
about your father!
Long nose.
What do you do?
Video Pirate! - Pilot?
Piracy... Long live video piracy
You mean crime... theft
E... Specsy... Don't call me a thief...
Who did you call a thief?
Don't you get scared, my son?
What's to get scared? Big brothers...
they handle everything
Brothers? How many
brothers do you have?
Brothers... Four but one
has been sent up there
Up there? You mean even
he's a pilot?
Up there meaning... - Oh! I'm so sorry...
How sad! - It is okay.
What happened?
Mummy, Papa... live in Connecticut

You speak too much
Just look into my eyes...
what do you see?
Bathroom.
The bathroom is over there. - Where?
There! - It is okay.
It's okay... Everything will
be alright...
The mother's slightly mad but
everything will be alright
Why are you guys shouting?
E... Mummy...
You old hag! I'm running out of here...
This doesn't work for me.
And this specsy...
She's like cactus... thorny...
What Sweetu is she man?
You are Sweetu?

You must come to my shop...
You'll come, won't you? - Yes!
Please don't go... Please...
Let me go... For God's sake,

You! - Are you alright?
Are you alright... I'm fine
Those guys are lunatics!
I will call you later.
- I will also call you later.
Run... run...
We don't want to go there.
You are laughing?
I don't believe this.
Normal people find
such situations funny
Are you trying to say
I'm not normal?
If you are normal...
then I'm Sridevi
Well. According to me.
You are not normal
Since morning, you have been behaving
like you have known us for years
Not years, darling...
For eons
In fact, I feel our bond is
from several past lifetimes
Listen... You are our neighbor
so please behave like one
Open the door... May I please
borrow half a cup of milk?
What are you doing?
Didn't you just say that I should
behave like a neighbour?
So may I have half a cup of milk?
So funny.
See... please take this
happy-go-lucky nature...
and knock on someone else's door
And we're genuinely
not interested.
What happened?
- What's your problem?
Problem? - Yes... why do you feel...
that the entire weight of the world
is on your delicate shoulders?
Who are you?
Don't...
What's the point of
praying to God...
when you don't know how to value
the life he has given?
What do you know
about my life anyway?
Not much, but enough to say...
that in your eyes perhaps
you don't have much
But look at your life
through someone else's eyes...
and you'll know you have a lot!
- Now I have to hear a lecture
Listen... Live... be happy...
Smile... Who knows?
Tomorrow may not be...
What a thought.
Tomorrow may not be...
Oh, It is too good.
Anyway, I will teach you to smile
It is a simple 3 parts process.
Try...
Try... - Don't touch me.
God... the poor thing has
forgotten how to smile
Just keep practicing
and it will come back
Your problem is that you think...
I know! I am very sexy.
But you are not my type
For now, just practise
Forget it. I am sorry.
I kept thinking the whole night...
was that idiotic Aman right?
Had I really forgotten to smile?
Of course she smile
The last time she smiled when... Uh
Now she will smile
only during her wedding!
Uh... uh...
Whenever she was with her
father, she smiled...
Uh... uh...
When the big brother threatens her...
that's when she will smile
What a beautiful smile!
Whose? - Priya... Who else?
The photograph was taken
at the wedding...
where did you find it?
It was lying in this file
I spoke to Priya this morning
She said you are meeting her today?
I was just leaving to go there...
Should I come with you?
- What will you do there?
In any case, I want to speak
to Priya in private...
Aren't you scared? - I'm not scared
You keep worrying unnecessarily.
There's nothing to worry
Everything will be alright...
everything will be alright...
Nothing will be alright...
till you lose weight
you are going to get no boy
But I'm trying Naina...
- I can see that
Wow! He is so cute, Naina.
He looks cute to you?
- You don't find any guy cute!
That is not true.
- I can't hear anything...
You were listening
to our conversation?
I wasn't listening...
I was trying to listen
If you speak so softly
how do you expect me to listen?
Excuse me, move... move...
We didn't meet that day...
I'm Ms. Square's new neighbour
...Aman
I'm Ms. Square's old
neighbour, Sweetu
Shut up. We were talking.
- Now we are talking
Look Sweetu... Any guy who looks
at your figure and loves you...
...will be blind!
...will be wrong. Ignore her.
He should look into your
heart deeply... - You're right.
I am always right.
Tell me something... ls there a guy
here whom you like?
That one.
His name is Ramdayal?
You know him?
No... but he looks the Ramdayal type
Yeah. Calling me?
- I am talking to you, Ramdayal.
Name's Frankie
Frankie Ramdayal
This girlfriend of mine
wants to leave me for you...
she says you are cool, sexy...
she says your hairstyle is wow!
What do I do Sweetu,
If I've not seen 'Dil Chahta Hai'?
So what if I don't know
much about hairstyles?
Are you going to leave me for this...
this shriveled mango?
What? - Sorry, Ramdayal.
How would you feel if I left you
for this... specsy?
You are a lucky dog, Ramdayal.
Go Sweetu... Go live your life...
be happy... be prosperous...
be happy with Ramu...
Is he coming?
Come on... come on...
Hi! Franky here.
- Hi! I'm Jaspreet.
Jas... what?
Sweetu. - Sweetu, sweet name.
I DJ at Club Nirvana.
Tonight's the retro night
Why don't you guys come along?
And get your mummy along
You take care, man.
Everything will be alright
How did you like my performance?
You are jealous because
now Sweetu has a boyfriend...
and you don't, Mummy!
- I do... I have a boyfriend!
You do?
- You do? Who's he?
Rohit!
But you said Rohit
was just a friend
I said that because I don't talk
about my personal life to everyone
But you should have told me
Oh! Sweetu, don't mind.
We'll go to the disco... and there
you won't have Ms. Square, Mummy!
Of course Rohit and I will come!
Of course we won't go!
But why? - I said no!
Rohit!
Gita is coming home for dinner
You can do all this but you
can't come for dinner with me?
Naina, try to understand.
Gita says she likes me...
- Why won't she say that?
After all she's found
a father for her kids...
Liar! - So she's a liar...
and you?
I spoke lies because that
stupid Aman irritates me a lot
He just met you yesterday...
How can he irritate you so much?
Do you know what he was saying? - What?
You won't believe it.
That I don't laugh...
I don't know how to smile...
that I don't have a life...
That I don't know how to live...
Naina... all that is true
I know, But why should
I hear it from him?
I want to show him that even
I can have a boyfriend...
who's cool, handsome and sexy...
- What did you say?
How much? - 3 dollars.
Before that... - Before what?
Before how much? - Just a second lady.
- Oh that...
That you are handsome,
cool and sexy...
You mean that? Do you really
think I'm sexy?
You are right! Just for that
stupid Aman we don't have to...
No... No... Let's do it.
- Let's do what?
Me boy friend.
You girl friend.
What about Gita?
- Who's Gita?
So we'll meet this evening at Nirvana
Yeah! What do you guys say?
- Having fun.
Sweetu! - I'm going to the DJ cabin.
You want to come here?
Yeah sure.
Aman, he called me Babe.
I love you Aman.
Now, go & love him.
By the way, where did you two meet?
In the park... - Park?
In the park?
But I thought you two studied
together in the MBA classes?
So what? Can't we meet in the park?
Of course you can meet... but what
were you doing in the park?
Very good question.
I had taken my doggy for a walk...
and she had taken her doggy for a walk...
That's strange.
But Naina doesn't have a doggy
Yes. - No.
I had taken my neighbour's doggy
for a walk
That's stranger.
I'm your neighbour.
And I don't have a doggy
Naina, you silly silly girl
you're forgetting.
...you took my doggy for a walk that day...
Rohit, you silly silly boy.
If she took your doggy for a walk
Then whose doggy did you
take for a walk?
I have two doggies
In fact, I have a lot
of doggies in my house
In fact, at times even
I look like a doggie
And then we met
at a friend's house
What's your friend's name?
Gita! - Gita?
That same Gita with
two filthy children
Hello Gita, hi.
Rohit... what are you doing here?
Didn't you say that you were
going out with your family? - Yes, yes.
Meet my mummy and papa.
He's a funny man.
Gita, my child!
I just got to know that their
love story was born in your house
- My house?
Oh, I'm sorry. Aren't you the same Gita
who has two filthy children?
Filthy children?
How dare you?
- Are you mad? Little Angel.
Stop...
You didn't even tell me
you had a girl friend.
I didn't know it myself...
She's not my girl friend.
Rohit, I'm confused...
what's going on?
Ask her!
Naina... What's going on?
I'm very confused ya.
You just shut up.
You knew all along that
Rohit and I are not boyfriend-girlfriend
Then why did you act? - Was I acting
or were you? - It's you.
It's all because of you...
Didn't you say 'laugh, sing, smile...?
I didn't say he he he...
I said EEEEEEEEEEE
Oh, please just keep quiet.
What do you think?
Coming here, dancing, singing
and drinking... means living life?
Well... anyone can do it
But I don't want to do it...
That's because you can't do it.
You're a bloody bore.
You're a cute boy.
Tell me about Gita, she's very hot ah?
- She's very hot man.
She has two children.
- Hey, you mad...
Nice, come on.
Yeah, come on, go ahead.
Come on...
Hey you nude... get down...
Hey babie, I'm talking to you.
Come on get down...
Get down you scum...
Hey, stop this music.
She's taking her clothes off, man...
That doesn't matter.
Everyone here is nude anyway
Come on, Naina...
"Mine is a crazy heart..."
"what has it to fear...?"
"When I sway to the beat..."
"what have I to feel
shy or hesitate about?"
"Let's dance, let's sing..."
"let's say together..."
"it's the time to disco"
"There's no saying
whom you might find"
"Mine is a crazy heart..."

shy or hesitate about?"
"Let's dance, let's sing..."

"Whom might you come up against...?"
"Bodies gyrate to the pulsating beat..."
"hearts being carried away
in the storm..."
"that's our state...
we're drowned in merriment"
"Lose yourself,
make merry..."
"say to the one
who provokes you..."
"it's the time to disco"
"Say it to everyone you meet..."
"it's the time to disco"
"This colourful evening,
dancing to the spirits..."
"there's intoxication in the air"
"What has sobriety to do...?"
"It's all about young hearts"
"This is the way to be..."
"and say it openly..."
"it's the time to disco"
"Try and get the word..."
"it's the time to disco"
"Mine is a crazy heart..."
"what has it to fear...?"
"When I sway to the beat..."
"what have I to feel shy or hesitate about?"
"Let's dance, let's sing..."
"and let's say together..."
"it's the time to disco"
"Whom might you come up against...?"
"It's the time to disco"
Listen, I'm telling you.

Naina fell down.
Rohit. He too.
Okay, then.

Shut up. I'm going
Now, listen.
- No... leave me... leave me...
Hey, listen... - Leave me...
- Shut up.
If you scream, I'll slap you
across your face!
Why are you shouting?
- I'm not shouting
Excuse me. - Shut up.

Idiot. Not each others.
Hold my hand... Now come on
