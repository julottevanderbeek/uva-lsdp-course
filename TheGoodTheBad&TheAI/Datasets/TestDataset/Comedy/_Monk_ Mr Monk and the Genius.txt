Payable to Natalie.
Teeger.
My four favorite words.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Um...
Excuse me.
Where's the rest of it?
I worked Tuesday night.
Remember? That was overtime.
Oh?
I thought you were
just hanging out.
No. Mr. Monk,
I wasn't just hanging out.
I spent seven hours
reorganizing the
utensil drawer.
That was work.
But you said it was fun.
I distinctly remember that.
I said, "Isn't this fun?"
And you said, "Uh-huh."
So...
You mean unless I'm
complaining, you're
not going to pay me?
Is that the new rule?
Even if I wanted to.
I've already torn it
out of the checkbook.
Yeah. So, you
just void it out.
Void. Write "void."
And then, you just
write another one.
Natalie.
I can't do that.
I wish I could.
If it were up to me...
Of course it's up to you.
I need you to use
your inside voice.
What?
Oh, my God!
All right.
God!
I'm a little short of
cash right now. Okay?
But I'm good for it.
You know I'm good for it.
Just keep track.
Yeah. I have been
keeping track.
It's over $1,800, Mr. Monk.
I'm sorry.
The door was open.
I thought I heard screaming.
Oh, no. That was just me.
I scream every payday.
Can I help you?
My name is Linda Kloster.
My husband is Patrick Kloster.
Patrick. The chess player.
I was just reading about him.
He's some sort
of super genius.
Like, off the charts.
Yes. Patrick has
an I.Q. of 180.
Four points higher
than Albert Einstein's.
What can I do for you?
Well, it's my husband.
He's going to kill someone.
How do you know?
He told me. He talks
about it all the time.
He says he has a perfect plan.
He says it's foolproof,
and that he'll
never get caught.
Did he say who
he's going to kill?
Yes.
It's me.
He's going to kill me.
Disorder and
confusion everywhere
Poison in the very
air we breathe
You know what's in the
water that you drink?
'cause I worry
all the time
If you paid attention,
you'd be worried, too
Or this world
we love so much
'Cause there's a
Can I get you
something to drink?
We have some wine.
Oh, no. Thank you.
I'm three years sober.
Well, three years
and two months.
Congratulations.
Mrs. Kloster,
isn't it possible that you
misunderstood your husband?
Patrick is not
an ambiguous man.
He said he's going
to kill me. In fact,
he tells me every day.
As I'm going to
bed, he'll say,
"Goodnight, sweetheart.
It won't be long, now."
Why don't you
go to the police?
I can't prove anything,
and he knows it.
It will be his word
against mine.
Well, can't you leave?
Go someplace?
You mean hide?
From Patrick?
Impossible. He'd find
me in two minutes.
He's a chess grand master.
The best in the world.
He can anticipate
my every move.
Murdering me is going
to make him a fortune.
He's taken out
a 10-million-dollar
insurance policy on my life.
Did he say when he'd...
No. But it will be soon.
And when he left this morning,
the way he kissed me...
It was different.
You know, the way he smiled.
It's definitely coming.
Where is he now?
He's playing a tournament
in Vancouver.
I've been following it.
That's right. He's in
Canada until Tuesday.
Well, at least you're
safe until then.
Am I?
Mrs. Kloster, I have
friends at the department.
Oh, I really appreciate
that, Mr. Monk.
But the police
can't protect me.
Patrick is smarter than
all of them put together.
My husband is going
to murder me.
I'm already dead.
And there's nothing you
or anyone can do about it.
Here's a check for $5,000.
I'm a little confused.
If you don't think
he can be stopped...
I'm hiring you, to catch him.
You mean after...
That's right.
After he's killed me.
Mr. Monk, you are the only man
smart enough in this world
to make him pay
for what he did.
Or rather, what
he's going to do.
I can't...
I don't know what to say.
Say yes, Mr. Monk.
Promise me.
Promise me you won't
let him get away with it.
I promise.
MAN ON TV: Once again,
Kloster is on the attack.
His dynamic style of play
has certainly been
on display today.
Your sister called again.
She's worried about you.
Frankly, so am I.
Looks like
he's winning again.
I'm sure he is.
Is the house alarm on?
Yes. I set it myself.
You'll check it again
before you leave?
I always do.
Don't open the
door for anyone.
Make sure Michael knows.
Let me make you some lunch.
You know, I think I'm
just going to take a bath
and maybe lie down.
I'm going to make
you a sandwich
I'll be right back.
How does she look?
Scared to death.
Of what? The son of
a bitch is in Canada.
I don't blame her.
What she needs is a good
therapist. They both do.
I'm happy I'm not a genius.
It screws with your head.
You want to do her a favor?
Put a little scotch in there.
MAN ON TV: And it's another
victory for Patrick Kloster.
We didn't have
any green tea.
But I found some Earl Grey.
Kevin, it's a
restraining order.
You issue 30 of them a day.
No, he hasn't hit her, I...
Yes, she's still in the house.
Because Adrian Monk told me.
That's how I know.
Fine. Good. You do that.
You sleep on it. Good.
How did that go?
Forget about him. Look,
just get a cruiser
out there. Park it out
front until further notice.
You got it.
You can't arrest
him for anything?
Well, apparently, there's
no law against giving
your wife the willies.
Captain, we just got a call.
Okay.
You'd better put down
the cup.
Just tell me who
called, Randy.
Just put the cup down
or finish it or
drink half of it.
Why?
Because you're
probably going to drop it
and I'm going to
have to clean it up and...
Just have a sip.
How about a sip?
Linda Kloster's dead.
Her housekeeper
just found her.
What happened?
I don't know. I...
Let's go.
Wait. Mr. Monk!
Let's go! We've got
to get over there.
Let's go, Randy.
Hey. The cavalry is here.
Could I have the room, please?
You heard the man.
He wants the room. Let's go.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Monk.
Not now.
Not now.
You can't blame yourself.
Yes, I can.
What did the paramedics say?
Probable heart attack.
He killed her.
He said he would kill her.
And he did it.
Okay.
Okay. There was no alarm.
There was no one in the house.
Just the housekeeper
and the cook.
No signs of trauma
or suffocation.
Poison.
No. Housekeepers said
she hadn't eaten all day.
Breakfast, lunch.
So, how did he do it?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Is he here?
The plane just landed.
What have you got?
You're not going to like it.
The ME said
natural causes.
Severe cardiac arrest.
What?
He's already
released the body.
What...
What about a complete
toxicology work-up?
He won't do it, Monk.
Not without probable cause.
But she, she was
What about the water?
The tap water in the bathroom.
Checked.
Well, how about her lipstick?
We checked that, too.
I mean, the toothpaste.
Even her eye drops.
Everything in the house.
It's all, it's all clean.
He killed her.
He poisoned her.
But how?
There he is.
You can ask him yourself.
Mr. Kloster?
How do you feel?
How do I feel?
I'm still in shock.
Linda was my
reason for living.
"Thou detestable maw,
thou womb of death,
"Gorg'd with the dearest
morsel of the earth."
Where is that from?
Look it up.
Dr. Kloster.
I'm Leland Stottlemeyer.
SFPD.
This is Lieutenant Disher.
Are you surprised
to see us, sir?
Yes. I am.
I mean, I'm surprised to
see you here. I expected
you in Vancouver.
Yeah, well, we
couldn't afford it.
Look. We're sorry
for your loss, sir.
This is Adrian Monk.
And Natalie Teeger.
Of course.
The legendary Mr. Monk.
I was hoping to see you here.
Hello.
Sir, we were wondering
if you would come downtown
and give us a statement.
I'm afraid my schedule
is rather tight.
But I did take the
opportunity of phoning
ahead and reserving a room.
Here. At the airport
security offices.
It's nothing extravagant,
but there is a table.
And five chairs.
How did you know
there would be five of us?
Please, Miss Teeger.
Don't insult me.
According to the Vancouver
police, they interrupted
the match at 1:21 p.m.
to inform you that
your wife had died.
That's right.
And they said you
kept playing.
That you finished the match.
Of course I did.
That's what Linda
would have wanted.
It's funny. I would have
been too upset to concentrate.
I was upset, Captain.
That's why it took
me 44 moves to win.
Your wife came to see
me this morning, Mr. Kloster.
Did she?
She told me that you'd
been planning to kill her.
My wife was
an unstable woman.
She didn't seem
unstable to me.
I'm sure she didn't.
What did the medical
examiner say?
Heart attack.
Yeah, she didn't
look sick to me.
And what medical school
did you attend, Miss Teeger?
My wife suffered from
high blood pressure.
And for most of her life,
she was an alcoholic
and a heavy smoker.
She was also quite depressed.
And there was
a 10-million-dollar
life insurance policy.
The policy was Linda's idea.
I'm insured for
the same amount.
What do you know about
poison, Mr. Kloster?
Not much. More than you,
I'm sure. But not much.
Although I am an expert
on the Poison Pawn.
Poison...
That is a chess move,
Lieutenant Disher.
I'd be glad to teach it
to you, if you'd like.
Well, as you can imagine,
I have a number of
arrangements to make.
Do you play chess,
Mr. Monk?
A little.
We should play
a game sometime.
We already are.
Okay. I found somebody.
He's a grand master
national champion.
And he beat Patrick Kloster?
Almost. They played
last year. It was a tie.
Well, where is he?
He's over there.
His name is Eric Tavela.
I can't believe you're
working on a Saturday.
Well, he's not paying me,
so, it's not really work.
Mr. Tavela,
do you have a minute?
A little busy at the moment.
You're, you're Tavela?
I wanted to ask you
a couple of questions
about Patrick Kloster.
You know, I'm working here.
You want to talk
you've got to play me.
It's 20 bucks.
Yeah. I don't. I don't...
I don't think I have
I don't have 20
dollars. I don't...
Do you, do you have any...
I don't think I have twenties.
I have eight dollars.
And an I.O.U.
for $1,800 from my boss.
Who's next?
I can play.
Five dollars, right?
I'm under 18.
You play chess?
I was in the chess club
for two semesters.
Two semesters.
Ooh! That's gonna impress
the Vassar Dean of Admissions.
It's your move.
The Bird Opening.
I've only seen
that five times today.
I understand that you
almost beat Patrick Kloster.
I'll get him next time.
What kind of player
is he, would you say?
Kloster's a behaviorist.
He studies you. Not the game.
He crawls inside your head.
It's kind of spooky.
Yeah.
What is a Poison Pawn?
Well, the Poison Pawn
is a trap.
He dangles a pawn
in the middle of the board.
You know, most
people can't resist it.
And then he swoops in.
And crushes you.
They can't resist it.
That's checkmate.
Thank you, Vassar.
That was fun.
A trap. A trap she
couldn't resist.
What, what, what, what?
I know that look.
You did it, didn't you?
You figured it out.
Who's the real
genius now, huh?
Who just outsmarted
the smartest guy in the
whole world? Tell me who.
I did.
This is a funeral
home, Mr. Monk.
My wife has just passed.
I find that grin on your
face rather inappropriate.
I know how you did it.
You still think I
murdered my wife?
You set a trap.
Like the Poison Pawn.
Oh, you've been chatting
with some chess masters.
Good for you.
When I was in your
bedroom on Wednesday,
I noticed a few things.
I just didn't put it
all together until today.
A glass that had
recently been washed.
Some breath mints.
Some eye drops.
And what did they tell you?
That your wife had
started drinking again.
NATALIE: Married to you,
I don't blame her.
MONK: She kept it
secret, of course.
At least, she tried to.
How long did it take you
to find her secret stash?
A day? A week?
On Wednesday morning,
before you left for Canada,
you poisoned her bottle.
Then put it back
where you found it.
Later that day,
Linda took a drink.
MONK: Then, she put
the bottle back.
As you knew she would.
It really was brilliant.
You didn't have to hide
the poison. She would drink
it, then hide it herself.
Natalie, call the Captain.
Yes, sir.
And did you find this bottle?
This hidden stash?
With the poison?
No. Of course not.
It's long gone.
You've had four days
to get rid of it.
But there are still
traces of it in here.
In her body.
We're going to run every
toxicology test in the book,
and we're going to find it.
I'm afraid you can't
touch that. I'm sorry.
She was our niece.
Well, I'm a former
police officer,
and I'm afraid we have to
borrow your niece,
her remains, for
a couple of days.
Borrow her?
Yes, we have to run some
toxicology tests on the body.
Oh, my goodness.
No, no, no.
We do it all the time.
We're going to cut her open
just, just a little bit
and
slice off a teeny-tiny...
Tiny piece of her liver.
And her stomach. And maybe...
Take a little... Tiny,
nearly imperceptible bit
of fluid from her eyeball.
Like on TV.
Who likes TV?
But why?
The fact is, we think
she may have been poisoned.
But how did the poison
get in the cable car?
What cable car?
The cable car that hit her.
That's how
Marjorie was killed.
Mr. Monk?
That's not my wife.
My wife is right here.
I had her cremated
two hours ago.
As you can see,
I have anticipated
your every move.
Cremated.
Yes. I don't think your
toxicology tests are
going to do much good.
But you are welcome to try.
Oh, I know that look.
I've seen it quite often.
It's how my opponents
look when they know
they've been beaten.
Your move, Mr. Monk.
"In chess, as in life,
creative strategies executed
with daring and precision
"will allow you to
overwhelm your opponent and
achieve your goal." The end.
And may I say, "Thank God."
Keep reading.
Here's the next one.
Oh, Mr. Monk, come on.
We've been reading
his books all day.
What good are they doing?
I'm getting into his head.
He's in my head.
I have to be in his head.
So, we're in each
other's heads.
by Patrick Kloster.
Well, this will be
the opposite of fun.
"For my queen, Tatiana."
You don't have to
read the dedication.
Fine, sorry. What's this?
Linda Kloster's check.
You didn't deposit this?
I'll never deposit it.
But Mr. Monk, she
wanted you to cash it.
Mr. Monk, if you
deposit this check, then
you can pay your staff.
And when I say
staff, I mean me.
She came to me.
I didn't protect her.
Mr. Monk, you did
everything you could.
What about the promise
I made that he wouldn't
get away with it?
You made a
promise to me, too...
There he is.
What?
My God.
Oh, my God. He's coming.
What do we do? We should kiss.
No! I didn't say that.
I wasn't thinking.
I never said that.
Good morning.
I thought you
might be thirsty.
Well, this is for
you, Natalie.
It's lemonade.
And, Mr. Monk, I believe
this is your brand.
Wow. My books.
I could autograph
one for you.
No, thank you. No.
Very well.
I'll leave you two alone.
Enjoy your little stake-out.
Well, you have to admit.
He's pretty good.
What? He was right.
I was thirsty.
What?
How do you feel?
I feel fine.
What?
It just occurred to me.
If there's poison in
that lemonade, we
could go to the DA
and we'd have all
the evidence we need.
It just occurred to you?
And you didn't say anything?
My God, Mr. Monk,
I have never
seen you like this!
How're you feeling now?
You know, I hate
to disappoint you,
but I feel fine.
Try the water.
Oh, my God. That's it.
We are going home.
Wait. Stop the car.
What. What.
What are you doing?
Just stop, stop, stop the car.
No!
Wait! What are you doing?
Where are you going?
His garden.
His garden?
Oleander.
It's from his garden.
It's poisonous.
Very poisonous.
You dry the sap,
you grind it into a powder.
A quarter of a gram is
enough to kill an adult.
It would look like
she had a heart attack.
It did look like she
had a heart attack.
This is how he did it.
So, you were in his garden?
On his property?
You said you wanted evidence.
Hard evidence. Here it is.
Monk, a million people
have this flower in their
garden. I used to have some.
Let's let the DA decide.
Monk, I am not going
to the DA waving a shrub.
Look. You don't
seem to understand.
This Patrick Kloster
thing is a big, bad headline
just waiting to happen.
Now, I know that you're upset.
I know that this case is
very important to you.
But we need real,
hard evidence.
Maybe if you found some
powder already ground up
in a little bottle
inside his house.
Maybe then.
In a bottle?
Right. We wouldn't
even need his fingerprints.
We could just say
he wore gloves.
What did you say?
Oh, nothing. Nothing.
Can I talk to you
for a minute?
Come here. I want to
show you something.
What is it?
Down the hall, there's a sign.
I think it's a little crooked.
I want your opinion.
Crooked? I'll be right back.
Come on.
How crooked is it?
Oh, it's very crooked.
You're not going
to believe it.
Why do you need me?
Because I'm not sure
if it is crooked.
You just said
it's very crooked.
Look. I don't know,
Monk. It's...
Is anybody else in there?
Mmm-mmm.
It's in here.
There's nothing
crooked in here.
I hope not.
Don't do it.
Don't do what?
Break my heart.
You're thinking about planting
evidence in Kloster's house.
Monk, I've been a cop
for 30 years. I've had this
conversation nine times.
I never thought that
I'd be having it with you.
There's a line.
You step across it,
and you're gone for good.
And there's no going back.
You don't understand.
I do understand.
I've been there.
I've had cases like this,
cases you couldn't shake.
Sometimes,
you have to let it go.
Let it go?
We have to move on.
There's a city.
A city full of people,
other people, that need
our help right now.
When Trudy was dying,
I got there late.
Almost too late.
I was there.
She was slipping away.
She couldn't speak.
All she could
do was reach out.
She...
She grabbed me
with both hands.
Just like this.
Eleven years later
I still feel it.
When I promised Linda Kloster,
when I gave her my solemn word
that her husband would pay,
she grabbed my hand
the exact same way.
I'm not letting this one go.
I'm not moving on.
That's an illegal
move, Mr. Monk.
Something I'd expect
from a much weaker player.
The truth is,
I have been waiting
for you all night.
I had almost given up.
You were waiting for me?
Hmm.
Ever since I noticed a
branch missing from an
oleander bush in my garden.
You don't really think that
window was left unlocked by
accident, do you, Mr. Monk?
Breaking and entering.
I believe that is a felony.
Don't worry,
I'm not a litigious man.
I prefer to settle my
problems out of court.
As you well know.
I am replaying a match
of mine from 1995.
Boris Spassky was
playing white.
Where would we be
without our little
games? Eh, Mr. Monk?
Sixty-four perfect
little squares.
An island of order
in a chaotic world.
This is where I beat him.
Right...
...there.
MONK: This is a wedding gift.
You dedicated one
of your books to
"My queen, Tatiana."
You were married before.
Very good, Mr. Monk.
Divorced?
My wife died.
She must have
been quite young.
Yes, she was.
Let me guess.
Heart attack.
JUDGE BARR: Mr. Kloster?
The District Attorney's office
and Captain Stottlemeyer
would like to exhume the
body of your first wife.
I've read their application.
They've listed a number
of similarities
between the two cases.
Your first wife, Tatiana Bay
Kloster, was in her thirties,
apparently healthy,
and died from a sudden
and severe cardiac event.
She, too, was heavily insured.
Captain Stottlemeyer
and Mr. Monk
have been to Pacifica.
They've spoken to some
of your old neighbors,
and a few of them remember
you had oleander plants in
your garden 15 years ago.
I'm convinced.
There's a clear and unique
pattern of behavior.
I am going to
grant this petition.
Your first wife's
body will be exhumed
first thing tomorrow.
And let me warn you.
If, in fact, there are traces
of this poison in her body
you can expect the
District Attorney's office to
bring two counts of murder.
CAPTAIN: Thank you, Judge.
Section 2-61.
Should be up there.
Here. Here it is.
Hey, hey! Over here!
You are making
a big mistake.
You made the mistake, Kloster.
You should have had
your first wife cremated, too.
Sorry for the delay.
We know how
important this is,
so we wanted to make sure.
There was no
poison in the body.
We didn't find a thing.
Impossible.
The woman died
of natural causes.
We're sure of it.
Thank you, Mr. Monk.
What for?
Our little game.
To be honest with you,
I'm sorry it's over.
M. C: Excuse us. There you go.
Gonna need you, young
man. Let's do this.
Hello, everybody.
Thank you so much for
your generous support.
We're going to begin
the exhibition in
just a few minutes.
International grand
master Patrick Kloster
will be playing
simultaneous matches
against four of
the highest-ranked
players in California.
It should prove to
be very exciting.
Oh, there's that kid from
the park. What a geep.
What's a "geep?"
I don't know.
It's a geek who's
a little creepy.
NATALIE: All right, Mr. Monk.
I have to be honest, I'm still
not quite sure why we're here.
He won't talk to you.
He won't return
your phone calls.
What can we do?
I don't know.
But I can't just quit.
To me, quitting would
be like giving up.
If I was playing
against him,
he'd have to
talk to me. Right?
Okay. Wait here.
What's she doing?
She's... She's flirting.
She's good at it.
Shut up.
She's definitely
done this before.
Okay.
Yeah. She's got it down.
Thank you.
Mom? You remember
my friend, Eric.
I told him about the case.
And about how you think
Mr. Kloster killed his wife.
I believe it, too.
Congratulations.
You're player number one.
You mean I can
play in the tournament?
You're my proxy. It's in
the bylaws. I can designate
someone to take my place.
Thank you.
Don't bring out your
queen too early.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome
international grand master,
Patrick Kloster.
Well, well, well.
The tenacious Mr. Monk.
Your threshold for pain
must be extraordinary.
It's your move.
Yes. I know.
Linda must have truly
despised me, to have
brought you into my life.
Mr. Monk.
That's my piece, Mr. Monk.
I'm just centering it.
You'll thank me later.
Mr. Monk?
Mom.
Okay.
Mr. Monk.
Please.
I pass.
You can't pass.
For the love of God,
why don't you just resign?
How about this?
If I win this game,
you have to tell me how
you poisoned your wives.
What are you talking about?
I am not agreeing to that.
How about this?
If we play to a draw,
you come with me to
police headquarters.
Mr. Monk, I'm not
negotiating with you.
When are you going to
realize that it is over?
You're castling?
Yes, the rook and the
king switch places.
They switch places.
Yes. It's the best
way I know to get
oneself out of trouble.
This is it.
You came here that
night before we exhumed
your wife's body,
and switched headstones.
That's why we didn't
find any poison.
We dug up the wrong body.
Very good, Mr. Monk.
You play
a brilliant endgame.
All right.
Can I tell you something?
I am sick and tired
of you talking like this.
All these chess metaphors.
Two women are dead.
They're not chess
pieces, Patrick.
They're human beings.
I think they deserve better.
Although, if you insist...
Checkmate.
What?
Nothing.
I was just thinking about the
case and how you solved it.
You really are amazing.
Well...
Thank you.
No, you really are my hero.
Okay.
Now, I thought,
I know it sounds crazy,
Mr. Monk, but...
Could I have your autograph?
Oh, please.
Please! Just to have it.
For myself.
Like a keepsake. Come on.
It will just take a second.
All right. If it really
means something to you.
Okay.
Thank you.
That's Linda Kloster's check.
Which you just endorsed.
I'll be right back.
I'm going to the bank.
You can't deposit that.
Why not?
You solved the case.
You kept your promise.
Besides, I need the money.
Natalie, let, let go.
Just give it back.
I think those books
are out of order.
Where?
Nat...
Oh, my God.
They really are out of order.
