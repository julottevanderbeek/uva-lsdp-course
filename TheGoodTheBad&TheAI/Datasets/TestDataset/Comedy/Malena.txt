This afternoon at 5:00...
Il Duce will speak
to the nation!
You are ordered
to turn your radios on!
All of you who have radio sets
and radio gramophones...
are ordered to turn them on.
Mussolini will speak
to all Italians!
You are authorized by order
of the Fascist government...
to interrupt your work.
This afternoon at 5:00...
Il Duce will speak
to the nation.
I was twelve and a half
when I saw her for the first time.
Even though I'm older now...
and my mind plays tricks on me,
I remember it well.
That day, Mussolini declared war
on France and Great Britain...
and I got my first bicycle.
The frame is British...
the gears are French...
and the brakes are from...
I forget.
But the chain is Sicilian...
always keep it greasy.
- Are you sure it's safe?
- I have new bikes too.
Mimi, we're at war.
Who can afford a new bicycle?
Fighting men...
on land, on sea
and in the air...
Black shirts of the revolution...
men and women of Italy...
and the Kingdom of Albania...
hear this. '
The hour...
of decisions from which
there is no return.
Pino, think this ant knows
he's dead meat?
Who knows?
If he's like you,
he doesn't know shit.
I'm free from misery.
Mary's son is my Lord.
Hey, guys!
Lucky bastard,
he's got a new bicycle!
Man, she's beautiful!
It's almost brand-new.
Custom-made,
just like the racers.
- Now you're a man, like us.
- So I can join the gang?
- "Don Agostino"?
- Okay by me.
- "Don Nicola"?
- I'd let him in.
- "Don Tonino"?
- Sure.
And you, "Don Sasa"?
I don't want some kid
poking into our business.
- Why? What are you doing?
- Can you keep your mouth shut?
She's coming!
What's going on?
If you wanna be one of us,
just shut up and watch.
Who is she?
The deaf guy's daughter,
our new Latin teacher.
- What's her name?
- What a wonderful ass!
What I wouldn't give
for an hour with her!
- Too bad she's married.
- If she weren't... What's her name?
Malena, the most beautiful ass
in Castelcuto.
The sun is bigger
than the moon.
Can I screw your daughter,
you deaf old fart? Yes, but hurry.
I love honesty
more than wealth.
- Seven thumbs long!
-Seven and a half thumbs!
- Mine's a bazooka! - I got eight!
- Eight is nothing!
That's just tickling a woman!
One, two... three and two is five,
two is seven and two is nine. Torpedo!
My submarine
will rip Malena in half!
Once I skipped school
and went by Malena's house.
She was at the window,
and she called out to me.
I thought she wanted me
to get her some cigarettes.
I went up for the money,
and her robe fell open.
And there she was naked as the day
she was born. Holy shit!
She did it on purpose
to excite me.
I was an idiot.
I should have jumped at the chance.
If it happens again,
I'll bang her brains out.
She'd quit smoking first.
She knows you've got no balls.
You little runt,
you've been here for two hours,
and you still haven't
measured yourself.
Measure it!
One, two...
three, four, five...
only six!
You know what they say
about a kid in short pants?
Short pants: short dick!
Fuck off. My thumbs are twice
as big as yours!
Bullshit!
Who's got the biggest dick
now, runt?
You do!
No, I am Il Duce!
Nobody's bigger than me!
- Ooh. Renato's skipping school.
- Shh!
You, come here!
I need some cigarettes.
What cigarettes do you want?
Macedonia Extra.
I remember this suit very well.
It's your father's.
I sewed it 20 years ago,
and it still looks brand-new.
He only wore it to his wedding.
He wants to keep it for his funeral.
If he's buried in this suit,
he'll go straight to heaven!
If he's buried in this suit,
he'll go straight to heaven!
- I didn't ask for your opinion, sir.
- Does he know about this?
- Of course he does!
You little scoundrel,
what the hell is this?
Come here, mister.
So you want to skip school?
Fine. Who didn't at your age?
Leave him alone!
I know what I'm doing.
And you let your friends
beat you up.
Even though when I was your age,
I'd beat my friends up!
But stealing trousers
from your father...
and getting them altered
for yourself is just plain wrong!
But, Papa,
you don't understand!
Understand?
Who said you could speak?
I'm ashamed
to wear short pants!
What about knickers?
They're almost long pants!
Enough! He's still a child!
I'll tell our party secretary...
you won't
Let me go to the fascist exercises.
Let's make a deal:
The day someone cracks the skull
of "Our Great Leader"...
then you'll get long pants.
Swear it.
chi...
A beautiful young woman
all alone here. It's a crime.
- Who's he talking about?
- Malena Scordia, Nino's sexy new wife.
She must have somebody on the side...
it's inevitable!
- Number fifteen!
- Me.
Right. Nino brings her from her village
with her ailing father.
And then a month later...
boom... Nino's called to the war.
Who here wants to bet
she's sleeping all alone? Not me!
Why don't you let me sit with the others?
You're too young to sit in the adult chair.
- But, son, if you don't know the title, how can
I help you? - It's that pretty, romantic one...
"Ma L'Amore No."
Why didn't you say so?
Ten lire. Pay at the cashier's.
- Don't you test it?
- What for? - It might be defective.
- It's brand-new!
Miss Malena,
this heart of mine, on fire...
has written so many letters...
and if I didn't have the courage
to send them to you
it was only because I didn't want
to do you harm.
So forgive me if I dare
to send you this one.
I want you to know
that this town has many gossips...
who say bad things about you...
that you have a secret lover.
I know it's not true.
You don't have anyone.
After your husband,
the only man in your life is me.
What an ass!
I have to go. I'll see you
at school tomorrow.
So long!
Don't get lost!
little boy, let me get by.
Hey, baby, give a soldier a break!
Mind your own fucking business!
Mr. lawyer!
Your newspaper's upside down!
Good morning, Signora Malena,
are you well?
How is your father?
May I?
The show's over!
She's gone now!
I forgot the key!
So it's true what people say! I
What's the matter with you? You look so strange.
You've poisoned me with your lies.
What lies?
I've never spoken to you.
I knew it from the start...
you're a loose woman.
But I've never
done anything wrong.
Liar! I've been following you on my bicycle!
I know where you went. I know everything!
- The lawyer, the dentist!
- No, Renato, I love only you! - Liar!
- Amoroso. - Here! - Cali. - Here!
- Costanza. - Here!
Professor, can I put my dick
between Malena's tits?
Can I put mine in her mouth?
Can I put mine between her legs?
Okay, but one at a time!
You must oil the bike regularly
Don't give me edible oil.
Bullshit, it's oil for machine.
The butter is better.
Why didn't she marry someone from her
own village? I'm sure no one wanted her.
- They say she's a seamstress.
- But she's so vulgar.
My son says she looks fake. My husband
says he wouldn't touch her with a ten-foot pole.
The Baron Bonta's mistress is much nicer.
At least Gina does everything in the open.
The baron screws her once a week
and then goes back to Palermo.
Malena acts so superior. Like we don't know
what she's up to. Wait and see. She'll get hers.
The headquarters
of the armed forces communicates. '
- It's OK now. - Thank you.
"Our brave and invincible fighting men
have delivered a powerful
blow to the faceless war machine
unleashed by the Allies.
In order to ensure the continued
strength and vitality of our forces at the front
all payment of civic pensions
will again be postponed..."
Renato, you've got the biggest gun in the West!
You're going to go bind!
Malena
Right rank!
Eyes front! Arms out, arms high,
in quick succession!
Have you heard? Malena's husband was killed.
My father told me. He read the telegram.
Malena is available!
Comrades of Castelcuto
we are gathered here today
to share in the tragic but honorable mourning
which has struck our town.
To express our deepest condolences
for the loss of Lt. Nino Scordia...
heroically killed in action
in Northern Africa...
and to his bride Maddalena who, stricken
with grief, unfortunately isn't here with us.
But she is with us in spirit
because Sicilian women...
with their hardships,
with their sacrifices...
march shoulder to shoulder
with fighting men.
The martyrdom of our fellow citizen in defense
of his country was not a useless sacrifice.
- It. Cadei is so handsome.
- A lucky girl will catch him!
...that will carry us to the
final victory of the Fascist Empire!
Long live Il Duce!
From now on I'll be at your side.
Forever. I promise.
Just give me time to grow up.
Now she'll take a lover for sure!
She knows that. She's 27 years old.
She knows her way
around the block!
Cusimano, the dentist, has gone crazy for her.
One day he was distracted as she walked by...
and pulled a healthy tooth
instead of the rotten one!
Dentist or not, why haven't we seen her lately?
Guess she's too busy!
They say she's fooling around with a shopkeeper
in Catania with subversive tendencies.
Some say Cusimano,
the dentist.
- A family man. It's disgraceful!
- When you're a born whore...
I hear the priest
has received anonymous letters...
saying her lover is this man, that man.
The voice of the people is the voice of God!
I can't talk to anyone
about my persona problems.
They're too intimate.
But you seem nice.
I'd like to confide in you.
Every day, I'll light a candle for you.
I'll even come to Mass on Sunday.
But you must protect Malena Scordia from the town.
Yes, the widow... at least for a few years.
Then I'll take over.
- Do you really want me? -OK, go.
- May I see you today? -I really don't want leave!
- Be quiet! -Just leave!
What will we to be? leave her! It will be Ok.
It's a kind of pain. Forgive me.
- Don't you like this movie?
Dam it
I am always at your service.
Renewed condolences, Malena.
What a piece of ass!
Son of a bitch!
You little runt!
Come back here!
Look at me
Where are you going?
Get up, it's late
Renato, get up. It's late.
Monster! You're a fetishist
a sadomasochist, or even worse, a pervert!
- What is that?
- It's just a French hat, Ma!
Shame on you!
- How pretty. Can I keep them?
- You shameless girl!
What are you looking at?
Get out of here!
Come here, you little pig!
- Goddamn pervert!
- What did I do?
You're not permitted to sit
at the table with us, understand?
- Answer me!
- Okay!
You no longer have the right
to speak to your sisters, understand?
Lock me up! I'll show you!
You're not to leave this room
until further notice!
Son, at least have some soup.
It will do you good.
Pietro, he hasn't eaten for three days.
In the Soviet Union, they never eat.
What is this shit? The Fascists gave it to us.
At least it looks like coffee.
Sure, and I look
like Vittorio De Sica.
Everything they give us is terrible!
Look at these pockets.
They're always ripping open!
This cheap thread doesn't hold the stitches!
The thread isn't the problem!
While our son recites poetry,
his hands go to work in his pockets!
What does that mean?
Do you get it now?
Just as well! Don't fix them.
Sew the pockets closed!
But he'll have no pockets?
He'll work it out.
It will be good for his health!
Lights out!
"...that the weary spirit may ne'er
repose in more restful harbor..."
- Has he gone crazy?
- I think he's gone bind.
"While upon women's work
you sat intent...
content with the vague future
you held in mind...
was the scented May,
and thus you used to spend your days."
- This child needs air.
- Air? Air.
Dentist
Good morning, Professor.
This letter is for you. It says "urgent."
"You're dishonored.
Your daughter Malena
is sleeping with the whole town."
It was an anonymous letter,
but I read it!
It says Malena is a whore with everyone in town!
So there's hope for us too!
Take it back!
I'll bust your ass, Mr. Short Pants!
Tonight was wonderful.
For me too.
I know it's been only ten months since.
But maybe I can see you again.
All right. You win. Tomorrow.
Okay, as long as I'm not on duty.
- Thanks for the flowers.
- You're welcome.
Take care of yourself.
So see you tomorrow?
- Until then.
- Good night, Leone.
What time?
- Good evening, sir. - Good evening, my ass!
How dare you pester my fiancee!
There must be a misunderstanding.
I was invited. You're a liar and a bastard!
Because I'm in uniform,
I cannot retaliate, sir.
- But you will answer to me.
- Anytime. Anywhere.
Coward, scoundrel!
Get up. Come here! I'll tear you apart,
you coward!
I'll break you in two!
Let me go! Or I'll have
to get tough with you!
Here's the adulterer!
My wife! - Officer, look! He's cheating on me!
- With a man?
With a traitor! You said you wouldn't
touch her with a ten-foot pole!
It's the dentist! I've been spying on you
a long time, you bastard!
And as for you go steal husbands
from your own village, you whore!
Go to the police station
We'll record all in files.
We knew she had one lover,
but two?
But where does the dentist fit in?
He fits in between her legs!
Her father was forced
to quit the school in disgrace.
He never wants
to see his daughter Malena again.
And the dentist's wife
kicked him out of his house.
That dragon of a wife
will drag him into court!
What's the dentist got to do with it, poor guy?
Malena's the whore! She should be taken to court!
That It. Cadei seemed like such a gentleman.
How could he get mixed up in this?
Everyone knows she's a home wrecker.
The lieutenant was asking for it!
will they go to court?
The dentist's wife
accuse her husband's lover.
The dentist needed three stitches in his head.
But the dentist swore at the soldier first.
That's insulting an officer.
They are all bastards.
While we were watching her caboose
the lieutenant and the dentist were riding the train!
Good morning!
Nice to meet you again!
Malena.
Good morning, madam
At your service anytime.
Greeting to you, Malena
She's either going
to the lawyer's or the notary's.
Sure, but what will she do
with two old men like them?
- Excuse me.
- Come in.
May I speak to lawyer Centorbi?
Please have a seat.
Sir, it's the widow Scordia!
Can it be true? Beautiful Madonna!
Have her come in.
Please sit down.
Charmed.
We now continue with the testimony
of Maddalena Bonsignore...
the widow Scordia called Malena.
She could get two years in prison.
Everything will be fine, trust me.
Please
You're accused of involving
Dr. Gaspare Cusimano...
in a secret and amorous relationship
aimed at the breaking up of his family.
Do you know Dr. Cusimano?
Yes.
Are you or have you ever been
his fiancee?
Absolutely not.
How could I be engaged to a married man?
Why was Cusimano,
at that unusual hour...
on his way to your house?
I don't know.
Had he been in your company
on previous evenings?
Yes, once.
Where?
At my house.
Jumped right in, the dentist did.
He looks stupid, but...
How long did he stay?
Not long.
What did you do?
He brought me some medicine for my father.
If it was for your father, why did he bring it to you?
I don't know.
What did you do after
he gave you the medicine?
He said good-bye and left.
Then why has Cusimano,
a reputable professional...
who, five years ago had the honor
of extracting one of Il Duce's teeth...
publicly declare that he is your fiancee?
He made that up. I had nothing to do with it.
Your husband's crazy. What kind
of relationship did you have with It. Cadei?
I'm a widow.
My business and that of Lt. Cadei
are no concern of the law.
All right.
Did you know that, as a result of these affairs
Lt. Cadei was transferred to Albania?
