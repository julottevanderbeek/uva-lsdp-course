We all start offin life
with a dream, don't we?
For a tennis player,
it's being in the final
ofthe Grand Slam--
center court, a high lob,
a smash.
Game, set and match--
you're a champion.
-
- You're number one.
But for most tennis players,
that's all it ever is-- a dream.
The reality is another story--
my story.
You see that good-looking fella?
No, not the kid in white.
The other, tired, good-looking fella.
Yeah. Him.
Well, that's me.
British Davis Cup a long time ago.
Two singles titles even longer ago.
presently ranked 1 1 9th in the world.
Sport is cruel.
Now, i know it doesn 't
sound too bad.
Four million tennis players in the world,
and i'm 1 1 9th.
But what that really means is this--
stronger, better andyounger.
and it gets you thinking.
You'll be 32 in--
The prime ofmy life.
How long can peter Colt
keep playing this game?
Time to retire gracefully.
Stop it. Stop it. J ust serve.
These young guys-- where do they
get the energy, the focus?
No fear. You see,
the one thingyou can't have is fear.
and for the first time in my life,
i'm afraid.
Not oflosing.
i'm not even afraid ofthe kid.
i'm afraid ofwhat happens
ifthat ball keeps going by me.
What happens then?
I hope you don't m i nd, but I took
the I i berty of havi ng it engraved.
@@
- Wow.
-  Exactly.
Frankly, my biggest problem
is parking.
Right.
Mm, not foryou, of course.
No. Your own space.
Nameplate again.
Oh, good.
Hello, Ian. Is this theyoung man
you were telling us about?
Mm-hmm. Peter Colt,
the one and only.
Once ranked
Uh, 1 1 th, actually,
forthe better part of'96.
Yes. Peter's got himself
a wild card at Wimbledon.
- Then we're hoping he'll be
hanging his racket here at the club.
- Well, we'll see.
Weshalllook forwardto givingyou
apeek at ourgroundstrokes.
Won't we, ladies?
- Oh, do shut up, Sylvia. Good luck
at the championships, young man.
- Thankyou very much.
Yes. Carry on.
Uh, Peter. Peter.
Watch the ladies.
Occupational hazard.
Of course.
Oh, look at this.
Look at this.
Completely new hybrid.
Yes, developed by the Yanks.
Firm but springy.
Look, peter.
I can't wait forever.
There's no one else I'd rather--
Ian.
Look no further.
You have your tennis director.
Oh, that is splendid.
So splendid.
Oh, look. That's Peter Colt,
the new pro.
Once ranked 1 7th
in the world.
Eleventh!
I was ranked 1 1 th in the world.
What makes one tennis player
different from another?
it isn't a killerforehand orserve.
Lots ofpeople have those.
But the great ones
have something else.
Some say it's a supportive family.
Others say it's being hungry,
really hungry.
But as you can see,
i've never been hungry.
Hel lo.
and as far as
a supportive family goes--
Mum? Dad?
anybody home?
Hel lo, Carl.
Life still giving
you trouble, is it?
Deep Throat. Di rector's cut.
absol ute classic.
-
- Hey.
They've been at it like that--
like cats and dogs-- for weeks.
You al I ri ght, Dad?
Yes, yes, yes.
You got our Wi m bledon tickets
sorted yet?
'Cause, you know,
I don't wanna miss
your grand finale.
Interesting bit oftrivia actually.
I've neverwon a match at Wimbledon
with my family in attendance.
We're not invited?
No.
- She's not gonna like that.
- What won't I like?
Hello, darling.
You're looking rather gaunt.
Thankyou.
Why is Dad so upset?
Oh. Ridiculous man.
For some reason, he believes
I'm having an affairwith Eliot Larkin.
Mother. He sawyou snogging
in the club car park.
Well, thatwould do it.
Not in the kitchen.
I wanted yourfatherto see us.
Thatwas the point.
Shake him out ofhis stupor,
compel him to act.
I hearyou're planning to retire
to babysit a bunch of old ladies.
Notwhatyourfather and I
had in mind all thoseyears ago
cheering you on.
and doyou knowwhy?
Because I believeyou to be
a truly great tennis player.
Oh, God.
You've just always been afraid
to admit it toyourself.
I'm not afraid.
I'm old.
Oh, don't be absurd.
Thirty-one is not old.
It is in tennis years.
I might as well beyour age.
Thankyou, dear.
and I'm tired ofhotels,
and I'm tired ofairports...
and long-distance love affairs
that never go anywhere and--
- Losing?
- Yeah, losing. Thanks, Carl.
Now tell her about the tickets.
Tickets?
Oh, God. You really are
a wanker, aren'tyou?
Harsh but fair.
Whydoesn't he have the tickets?
i mean, doyou know why?
What does he think?
Does he think
we're going to sit here
watching it on television?
-
- Dad, what are you doi ng up there?
I should've moved up here
years ago.
Right. Well, i'm off
up to Wimbledon then.
Righto.
Peter.
Yeah.
Remember I always told you
that tennis was a gentleman's game?
Yeah.
Total bollocks.
Everything i evertoldyou--
total bollocks.
Right then.
- Welcome to the Dorchester, Mr. Colt.
- Thankyou.
You have a suite, top floor.
Wonderful view.
Really, I think
you might have made a--
- Thankyou.
-
Wow.
Well, theyweren't wrong
about the view.
You need something?
Yeah, i--
I'm so sorry.
I was given the key to Room 1 221.
This is Room 1 221 --
my 1 221.
Oh, right. Your 1 221.
Well, that makes perfect sense.
- What makes perfect sense?
- You see, I'd reserved a more modest room.
Now I'll go down
to the front desk and...
thank them for this dreadful error.
Good-bye then.
Yes, good-bye. and may
I say good body-- Luck!
Shit. I meant--
Shit.
Oh. Lovely kitchen.
This way.
See now? That's much cozier.
Yeah. I get a lot of questions
about my personal life.
- I usually don't answer them.
-  That's why
it's calleda personal life.
Right. I mean, I just want
to focus on my game, you know?
Unfortunately-- I have to agree
with my dad on this one--
all that other stuff
just gets in the way.
But, Lizzie, you have had problems
with chair umpires this year.
Some ofthe players think
you go out ofyourway
to disrupt a match.
i really don't.
i mean,you know,
maybe I go a little
over the top sometimes,
but, you know, maybe that's what
I need to do to play my best.
and that's why I came to London--
to win Wimbledon.
We'll be watching.
Good luck.
Gonna knock 'em dead this year, Peter?
That's the idea, Danny.
I've got a strong feeling.
Thanks, Danny.
Gonna knock 'em dead
this year, Ivan?
I'll do my best foryou.
I've got a strong feeling.
- Seeyou later.
- Hey, Dieter. You wanna go for dinner?
afraid not. There's a chance
I may get lucky tonight.
Oh, really?
Intriguing Irish girl.
Her father owns much of Dublin.
Excellent.
She have a sister?
Only child.
Tragic.
ishouldstay
and work on myserve anyway.
This is my last hurrah.
I wanna go out in style.
Well, that's the spirit, old man.
Bugger.
Oops.
Sorry. Wrong court.
Forgotten me already?
God, no. You're the lady
with the lovely... kitchen.
Uh-huh.
Lizzie Bradbury, right?
and you're?
Peter. Peter Colt.
Nice to meetyou,
Peter Peter Colt.
- Five quid says you can't do it again.
- Mm-hmm.
Ten bucks says
you can't hit two in a row.
You're on.
Lovely form.
Thankyou.
Hmm. You're exceeding
my expectations.
Mine too.
Do it with a slice serve,
I'll treatyou to fish-and-chips.
Ooh. The pressure's on.
Lovely toss.
- Fish-and-chips it is then.
- Lizzie, sweetheart,
what the heck areyou doing?
- Oh,just one more serve, Daddy.
- You gotta be back in the hotel
in 20 minutes for an interview.
Two seconds, okay?
It's funny. You don't seem
the "Daddy" type.
Hit this one,
and I'll sleep with you.
-
- I'm so sorry!
Too bad. You could've
used the workout.
Hello, and welcome to day one
ofthe championships,
where the players meeting
on center court today...
include andy Roddick,
Serena Williams...
and Britain's best hope for a title,
Tom Cavendish.
Other Brits i n action i ncl ude
journeyman veteran Peter Colt.
and today marks
the Wimbledon debut
of american Lizzie Bradbury.
We'll see if she can live up
to her lively reputation.
What areyou talking about?
The chalk flew up.
There's a mark right there.
- The ball was out.
- Get on with it!
You know what,
i'lllet it go.
'Causeyou obviously can't see it,
and I feel sorry foryou.
Quiet, please.
Yes!
How are you doing?
What time's your match?
You ever heard of him?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's sitting over there.
Look.
Oh, my God.
Shouldn't he be off
discovering masturbation orsomething?
Played him at Bogota.
He's like all young men--
out to destroy us,
to kill the father.
and like allyoung men,
he must first be taught
the lesson ofhumility.
Exactly. and you taught him
that lesson in Bogota?
Sadly, no. He killed the father--
straight sets.
Watch out for his backhand.
Twenty pound to win--
ajay Bhatt.
Hold on. Hold on.
Isn't he playing your brother?
You should be ashamed ofyourself.
Yeah, but, curiously, I'm not.
So this is it.
This is the end.
This is what it looks like.
Six million balls.
and it all ends here,
at 2:00 in the afternoon
on Court 1 7...
while they're over on center court
screaming for the latest
Russian teenage beauty.
Well, let's see ifl can at least
make it last a little while.
ajay! Come on, ajay!
- Good luck, Mr. Colt.
- Thankyou.
Bhatt to serve.
First set.
Right then.
play.
-
- Love-1 5.
Okay, nice. Not embarrassing.
another 71 like it,
and you've got it in the bag.
Oi! Bloodyrabbit!Shoo!
We have ourfirst match point.
Yes! Come on.
i must say he's playing with
newfound confidence today.
Yes.
So here we are--
match point.
Yes! Come on! Get it!
Yes! Good shot!
Well done! Come on!
Come on! Yes!
That's it!
He 's done it!
He 's done it!
He's through round one!
Not i nterested.
What?
Not interested.
Oh, suit yourself.
So you think that kid
has a future.
Yes, I do.
I expect, one day, to be
the answer to the trivia question:
Who beat ajay Bhatt
in his first ever Grand Slam?
What Wimbledon is this
foryou, Peter?
It's my 1 3th actually.
and since this maywell be my last
Wimbledon press conference,
um, I'd like to take the opportunity
to announce my retirement from--
Jake!
Please. Come on, man.
tennis.
That's my retirement from tennis--
effective the moment
this tournament ends.
Lizzie!
Tomorrow morning, I wantyou
at the rear entrance, 9:00 sharp.
We can avoid all ofthis,
all right?
Yeah, you're probably right.
Excuse me, ladies, ifyou please.
Come on, sweetheart.
Hey, Lizzie! Lizzie!
-  Jake.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.
How's your injury?
You have one new message.
Congratulations.
You still owe me fish-and-chips.
uh, say, 7:00?
Room 122 1.
That's my 122 1.
Oh, bollocks!
it's open.
...kuiperbelt appears tonight
in the northern sky.
Once mistaken for a shooting star,
the comet gained its name...
from two U.S. servicemen
on patrol in the South Pacific.
I t's the first time in 67 years
it's appeared...
and will be visible
to the naked eye
for the next two weeks.
-
- Hi.
- Hi.
Uh, two fish-and-chips,
as promised.
Um--
What?
Let me just--
Oh, geez.
How embarrassing.
get this.
areyou hungry?
Um, not quite.
I've got a question foryou.
all right.
Where doyou come down on
the whole "fooling around
before a match" issue?
Well, that's a very intriguing question.
'Cause I think a little fooling around
can be really good foryour game.
You know, helpyou relax.
Um, I'm not sure
I've done enough research
to have a definitive opinion.
That's very sad.
Yes, it is, isn't it?
It is... very sad.
Don't get me wrong. I'm--
very interested in doing
the necessary research.
areyou?
I'm interested.
Peter?
No one
can know about this, okay?
Really? I had been planning
a brief press statement.
Seriously. Especially my dad.
He's convinced, ifthere's a guy around,
my first serve gets mushy.
Well, you can't win Wimbledon
with a mushy serve.
No. So... we'll keep it light.
Okay?
absolutely fine with me.
We'll just keep it, you know,
fun and... relaxed.
Relaxed.
Good.
peter?
Excellent.
More research.
and that's anotherpoint lost.
The truth is that Dragomir...
seems to have completely
seized control on this court,
known as
"the graveyard of cham pions."
For some reason,
peter CoIt's game
this afternoon...
has been less than inspired.
Oh, God! Oh, God, I 'm tired.
I 'm so tired.
Ofcourse you are.
Stay up all night doing research,
you're bound to be.
Game-- Dragomir.
What a pity.
Dragomir leads five games to four
in the fourth set and by two sets to one.
Come on, Peter.
Hello! Do you mind?
Bugger. He was doing so well.
I wouldn't write him off
just yet, Pauline.
Someyoung men, I find,
have a stamina that's...
really quite deceptive.
The second round.
That's not so bad.
He did win the French Open.
at leastyou got three games offhim.
Three games?
Three lousy games?
Last match ofyour career,
and you got three games?
Time.
It's pathetic.
Come on, peter!
Well, at least there's no one here
to seeyou lose.
Come on, peter!
Oh, great.
Come on, pete!
Love- 15.
Who would have thought, 40 minutes ago,
that we'd be in a fifth set?
But here, peter Colt--
who hasn't beaten a top- 1 0 player
in the past two years, remember--
is at 5-4, three points
from winning the match.
- You were with me last match.
- Yes, sir. Brilliant play, sir.
- Do you think I could trouble you--
- Sorry.
-
- 40-love.
and we have ourfirst match point.
- Out!
-
Game, set, match-- Colt.
incredibly,
the English wild card, peter Colt,
has defeated the French Open champion
to advance to the third round.
-  Three sets to two:
-
-
-
-
I thought I'd done
my last one of these.
So did we.
So did we. Yeah.
peter, didyou know
that Dragomir is the first seededplayer
you've defeated in three years?
Yes. Uh, two months and 1 4 days.
But who's really counting?
What, uh-- What do you think
ofyour next opponent?
Truthfully, in all the excitement,
I haven't even checked
to see who it is.
it'syourpractice partner.
Dieterprohl.
So two friends must now
face each other as enemies.
an intriguing existential dilemma.
Room 1 22 1, please.
Right.
Is your elbow playing up?
Well, if I admit to that,
you may use it toyour advantage.
Wow. That's terrible.
Is that what our friendship's come to?
Dodgy shoulder maybe?
The truth is, most everything aches.
What doesn't, I can't feel at all.
Tell me about it. Hello?
Hello? Mm!
We should still
practice together.
We must stick
to the routine.
The hotel offered me a better room.
I told them I'm on a roll at the moment
and I'm not changing rooms.
at such moments,
our superstitions are all we have.
Exactly.
Even when I'm taking a shit,
I must do it exactly the same.
I'd never thought ofthat.
That's genius.
You think of everything important--
you do it the same.
Oh, wait a minute.
Yeah. Oh, that's okay.
Put me through.
Lizzie, listen, don't say a word.
I was thinking a repeat
ofthe other night...
Iike fish-and-chips,
early to bed.
Sh-- Mr. Bradbury, hello.
Mr. Bradbury?
Damn.
Yeah?
Yeah.
- peter.
- Billi.
Come stai?
You are the Dragomir slayer.
How are you?
You look a million... Iira.
Oh, thankyou, thankyou.
I try.
Doyou know my partner, Sophia?
No. Hi.
Nice to meetyou.
So?
I'm looking
for Lizzie Bradbury.
Haveyou seen her?
No. Maybeyou should ask
Jake Hammond.
Oh, really? Why?
Why doyou think?
Oh, right.
ah.
Well, I'd better
get a move on. Ciao.
Good luck tomorrow.
Thankyou.
Looking forsomeone?
- Yeah. Ye-Yes.
- Wouldn't happen
to be my daughter?
Yes, it would.
It's Colt, right?
Yes, but please call me Peter.
Lizzie's on a roll right now,
and I don't want her
to have any distractions.
Right. Of course.
S-Sorry.Just to clarify.
Doyou see me as a distraction?
That's exactly how I seeyou.
So stop looking for her.
Stop calling her.
Stop coming around.
Stop every damn thing
that involves my daughter.
Is that clear?
isuppose,
in a few thousandyears,
the English will evolve webbed feet.
Yes. J ust about the same time
the first German evolves
a sense of humor.
No, no, no. That's unfair.
Many times, I make you laugh.
No. I'm laughing atyou,
not with you.
Ha ha.
Somebodywantsyou.
Oh, you know what?
I think I'll--
I thinkyou will too.
See? Now that was quite funny.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, get some rest tonight.
I don't wanna win too easily,
what with you and that,
what is it, bad knee?
I have a little confession
to make.
Oh, God.
When you, uh, walked
into my room the other day,
I knew exactly
who you were.
You did?
Mm-hmm.
I sawyou playTommy Haas
at the Lipton lastyear.
Oh, shit.
Yeah.
You were ahead,
but then you totally
fell apart, remember?
Yes. I recall the ball girl couldn't
get out ofthe way of my serve.
You gallantly carried her
offthe court.
I thoughtyou were such a...
asshole.
To lose like that when you
were playing so beautifully?
I couldn't get it out of my head.
I kept hoping I'd run intoyou.
Until finallyyou walked
into my hotel room.
Like a knight in shining armor
perhaps?
No.
Trouble is, I'm the one
that needs saving.
Yesterday, I was losing,
and then I sawyou watching.
What?
Perhaps my first serve's
getting a little mushy.
Mm-hmm.

Hardly anything, is it?
Barely moving.
We have to wish on it.
Did you wish
on your next match?
It wouldn't work
ifl told you.
Who doyou play?
Good friend of mine actually.
Dieter Prohl.
a friend? Then you should know
how to beat him.
What are his weaknesses?
Um, sausages, Wagner,
men in leather shorts.
In his game. That's why I gave up
having girlfriends in tennis.
You have to dig extra deep
to kill your friends.
Now I have to kill him?
Without thinking twice.
and I don't envyyou.
Why's that?
Youpractice together,
you travel together,
you practicallylive together.
Do you really have what it takes
to close out a friend
in the third round of Wimbledon?
Because that is killing him.
it's a bullet to the heart.
That's what's tough
about this game.
There 's a winner,
and there 's a loser.
and tomorrow, one ofyou
is going to be a loser.
Bloody pedals!
al I ri ght. Vi j.
Wh-Where the hell
are the men's matches?
Man, Roddick lost to Jake Hammond
in four sets, mate.
Shit. What about Peter
and Prohl?
Didn't hear?
No.
Straight sets, man.
Pete decimated him.
Tore him to pieces, man.
Shit!
Oh, what, you bet
against him again?
You know, that bastard
usually comes through for me.
He's been on such
a good losing streak.
Here. areyou, uh,
Peter CoIt's brother?
Possibly.
I've seen you in here
watchin' the matches.
Yeah.
- You could say tennis is my life.
- My passion's chat rooms.
Really? Hmm.

Of course.
You may have humiliated the kraut,
but you're not done with him.
You change your routine
not one iota.

Thanks, mate.

Something's happened toyou.
Something else, something--

That's--
That's where the fire comes from.

Dieter, listen.
Doyou think that,
in the middle ofa championship...
and forthe first time in years
I'm actuallywinning,
I'd be dumb enough
to get involved with a woman?
absolutely.
You have eight new messages.

What are you doi ng here, Ron?
You're not still my agent, are you?
What are you talkin' about?
What am I talking about?
Okay, well, I called you
about a year ago,
and I'm still waiting
foryou to return my call.
Yeah, I'm into e-mails now.
I don't do the, uh,
phone thing anymore.
Ron? That's a lie.
Yeah, it's a lie.
You want me to be
completely honest with you?
agents are not miracle workers.
We can't sell a product
that doesn't exist.
But hereyou are existing again,
so I'm back selling again.
You know what, Ron?
I genuinely despiseyou.
and you know what, Peter?
I really don't take it personally.
Because this could all
be over by Monday.
Cavendish is a serve-and-volley guy,
and you've always played shit
against them,
so I'd like to capitalize now
ifthat's not a problem with you.
I don't wantyou
to go down in history...
as that English guywho beat
his best friend, the German guy,
only to get beat
by the other English guy.
I'd like to put some money
in your pocket.
You got a problem with that?
You'd have to cutyour commission.
Okay, look, unfortunately
that's a no-go area.
Everybody pays 1 0%.
Say five percent,
or the next offer's four.
You know, success
has really changed you.
and I'm loving it.
Screw it. You got a deal.
Besides, I have a funny feeling
that Cavendish is going down.
Tea?
Yes. I'd love some.
Now let's get down to business.

grandpa, ranked, like, 1 20?
I thought all those things
they said aboutyou were just rumors,
butyou really are a cheap little--
-  Oh!
-
Jesus! That really hurts.
Butyou did it sowell.
areyouallright, sir?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Good night,Jake.
Hey, yes, don't get up.
Leave me alone!
i'm fine!
That's the first time I've ever
hit anybody in mywhole life.
Lizzie?
Lizzie!
Other side. Other--
I've never had anyone
fight for my honor before.
I kinda like it.
Jesus Christ! You're not safe to be with.
Wait till you see me drive.
So, these are
the wild streets of myyouth.
The drugs, the sex, the milk shakes.
My parents live here,
and I still keep a flat.
Oh, so we can
stay there tonight.
Yeah. But what aboutyour dad?
aw, let him find his own place.
Parents are such a responsibility.
I know.
They're worse than children.
Oh, definitely.
My parents got divorced
when I was 1 3.
My mom was always on the road
trying to be a singer.
What went wrong?
She couldn't sing.
So mainly my dad brought me up.
Mine are still together.
Which proves that
love's not just blind,
it's bloody stupid.
It's sad.
Everything they used to love in each other
now seems to drive them crazy.
I can't imagine
everwanting to get married.
No. No.
I mean, that's why
we love the tour, isn't it?
There's always another country,
another airport.
another girl.
That's right, Leslie.
Lizzie. I meant Lizzie.
Ow, ow. I meant--
You said "Leslie."
Who's Leslie?
as you can see, we've, uh,
we've had to fire the builders
due to creative differences.
and truthfully, peter's had
a little bit ofa liquidityproblem.
Oh, my nan liked to drink.
Sherry.
Right.
Piccy?
J ust a bitty.
- Carl, what are you doing?
- Uh, Pete. Hi.
Um, wasn't expecting to see you.
and-- Shit! That's Lizzie Bradbury.
Can i take a picture?
No, you bloody can't.
- It's digital.
- Lookwhat I found.
Oh, hello.
Give me that.
Who are you?
Oh, I only got four pizzas.
Oh, for God's sake!
Right. That's it. Get out.
Come on.
You too, sunshine.
Bugger!
I had it on "Landscape."
Stop it. It's not funny.
I'm sorry.
Move it!
Change ofvenue, girls.
Children out!
Come on.
- Big fan.
- Come on.
Leave.
I am so sorry.
Might wanna
change the sheets.

- Hi, Daddy. It's me.
I know you're probably going nuts
and wanna kill me.
But everything's cool.
Really.
Um, it's hard to explain,
but I really needed to do this.
and-- I gotta go.
I'll--I'll seeyou at practice
in the morning.
- Everything all right?
- Everything's great.
aren't we gonna have a workout?
I thought we just had one.

Huh.
Look at it now.
it's a shame.
Yeah.

Come on. Make a little effort.
ace!
What's the matterwithyou?
areyou scared ofa girl?
- There's something
I haven't told you.
- What?
This is my last tournament,
no matterwhat happens.
But you're doing so great.
- Hey, you just have to--
- Keep winning.
Right. So keep winning.
Oh, finally.
Colt returns with a somewhat demure
crosscourt forehand.
ah! Colt makes a smashing return.
With unladyl i ke effort,
Bradbury strai ns
to get to the ball.
Oh! it's an extremely high lob.
Will he maintain
his gentlemanly composure,
or will he-- dare i say--
win the point?
Hold on.
What's happened to the ball?
Look.
Gotta go. Good-bye.
H undred quid on Cavendish
in the quarters.
Hold your horses.
So, still bettin'
against your brother, are ya?
It's tactical. Ifhe loses, I get rich.
and ifhe wins, I get laid.
Where the heck did you get
a hundred quid anyway?
Photojournalism.
I trustyou slept well
afteryour night of debauchery
with young master.
I declare, I surely did.
Good. So did I.
God.
No wonder the English
neverwin Wimbledon.

I'd love to see an English guy
in the finals, but give me a break.
peterColt is the luckiest man
in tennis.
Oh. Wanker.
God, it's incredible how much
that actually looks like your dad.
Oh, shit.
Incredible how much
that building--
Shit!
Shit!
Quick! Hide!
Oh, Carl! You bastard!
Oh, hello. Mr. Bradbury.
Where's my daughter?
She-- Gone, sadly.
Sadly, gone.
She had to go and work
on that first serve.
I expect she meant to meet you
at the practice courts.
are you bullshitting me?
absolutely not.
I'd never bullshit you.
I wouldn't dream ofit.
So, how was your trip down?
The traffic can be murder
getting out of London.
We left early.
Well, the early bird
does catch the worm.
Uh, wou-would you like
a cup of, uh, tea?
Maybe something stronger.
a shot ofwhiskey.
a shot at me.
It's Peter, right?
Yeah.
Look, Peter, I got nothing
againstyou personally.
- You seem like a nice guy, and, uh--
- Oh, good.
I'm not an idiot.
I know that Lizzie likes to...
have her fun.
and it keeps her relaxed.
Um, ifyou were just
another easy--
You know.
Well, that would be one thing.
Butyou're not, areyou?
as a matter offact,
I was incredibly easy.
No, no.
This time, it's different.
She's... falling foryou.
- Oh, I see.
- Which is a total disaster.
But why?
She's hardly lost a set. I--
Look, her footwork is off.
Her serve is a mess.
She's gotta get her head
back in the game.
She's gotta remember
what it is that she wants.
and what do you think that is?
What we've been working towards
all theseyears,
what she's always wanted
more than anything.
- I still want it.
- Oh. Hi.
I want to win Wimbledon.
I'm sorry.
That's all right, sweetheart.
Well, we'd better get going.
We got a lot ofwork to do.
- You're gonna go?
- Yeah. He's right.
I'm sorry.
Wait a second.
-
-  Lizzie?
Lizzie!
Lizzie, this is ridiculous.
You're a grown woman, and you should
be making your own decisions.
This is my decision.
We can be together
after the tournament.
after the tournament?
What does that mean?
You can'tjustswitch me on andoff
like a bloodylightbulb.
I'll call you at the hotel.
She won't be at the hotel.
What?
i'm sorry, kid, but--
Ifyou're together,
she can't play.
-
-
-  Tom! Tom! Tom!
-
Well, this may be an all-British affair,
but Tom Cavendish is clearly in control
ofthe crowd and the match today.
He 's up a break in the first set,
and peter Colt-- with the expectations
ofan entire nation upon him--
seems to be withering
under the pressure.
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet please.
-
-
So that's set point
for Tom Cavendish.
Li nda, to the patio door.
Well, talk to Sergei.
She hits short,
you come in.
Daddy, stop bugging me.
She'll never pass you.
I'm focused.
I know the game plan.
Yeah, right.
He's out of my head now.
It's over.
Stop freaking out on me.
Oh,yeah.
it was definitelyhis ankle.
You can see how he landed right on it.
This is ugly.
-
-
Cavendish! Cavendish! Cavendish!
peter Colt may have just
got himselfa free pass to the semis.
- Thi nk you can go on?
-
Not so fast, Chrissy.
Listen to the crowd.
They worship the kid here.
The question is, will Colt be able
to take advantage ofTom Cavendish?
He's never shown
much ofa killer instinct.
Quiet, please.
-  40-love.
-
There 's your answer,John.
Look at that smile.
Watch out, Tom Cavendish.
@@
Can we take another route?
Her match is at 3:00.
I doubt it. It's a chocker.
What's the score, sweetheart?
It's match point.
Game point.
He's done it!
peter Colt has done it again!
another upset.
another seeded player goes down,
and Colt will now take on
fifth seed pierre Maroux
in the semifinals on Friday.
Congratulations, my friend.
Thank you, but I think
my countrymen hate me.
What?
I've just destroyed their best hopes
ofwinning a championship.
Oh, ridiculous.
Everyone loves a winner.
Everybody but the British.
Thankyou.
See, I was right.
Everything's good.
Everybody loves you.
almost everybody.
What doyou think
makes herso extraordinary?
No embarrassment, no fear.
She makes a decision,
she goes for it, all pistons firing.
it's a turn-on forthe rest ofus
'cause most ofthe time, let's face it,
we're allscaredshitless.
Even you, Ron?
Me? I hate making a decision.
Like right now,
I'm very, very afraid.
Ifyou don't see that girl again,
it's going to mess with your head,
screw upyour confidence.
On the other hand, I'm terrified--
I'm petrified that ifl tell you
where that girl is camped out,
her father's gonna fire my ass.
Where's the girl camped out, Ron?
First-floor apartment.
I made a decision.
Game-- Miss Bradbury.
Miss Bradburywins finalset.
Me too.
Oh, shh. Shh.
No. No. Hi.
Shh.
- Now, listen. It's not
what you think, so don't start--
-
I'll jump. I'll jump.
I will. You want that
on you conscience?

- Thankyou.
Lizzie? Lizzie?
Lizzie, it's me.
Shit!
Hey! Shut up!
Noisy little shit.
Oh--
That hurt.
-
- Bugger!
- Peter.
- Yeah.
- What areyou doing here?
- That's an excellent question.
That sad fact ofthe matter is,
I can't seem to get through
I missed you,
Peter Peter Colt.
You have?
But I need you to go.
No, you need me to stay.
Peter.
Lizzie.
Peter.
Lizzie.
People have fallen in love
before, you know.
Oh. Is that what
we're doing here?
Good thing you didn't
get the wrong room.
I did, butyour dad's
a very quick shag.

Goodmorning!
BBCLondon 94.9.
The lark's on the wing
andeverything's forthe best...
in this best ofall possible worlds,
'cause it's semifinals day.
Which means it can only get better
as peter Colt stares down the racket
ofpierre Maroux.
Game point.
Whoa! peter Colt must have had
his Wheaties this morning.
He's offto a roaring start.
But remember, Chrissy,
the last time these two met...
was in '97 u.S. Open semis,
a day i'm certain peter Colt
wants to wipe from the memory banks.
No kiddin '. it was the greatest
opportunity ofCoIt's career.
He was up two sets,
and then he completely choked.
and I don't thi nk he's ever
ful ly recovered from it.
You know,John, choking can be
instigated by the smallest thing.
absolutely.
You wake up in the morning,
and somethingjust isn't right.
Or maybe a little superstition
you have goes wrong.
and a seed ofself-doubt is planted.
Lizzie! i love you!
Then everywhere you look,
that feeling ofdoubt seems to be
looking right back atyou.
Once that happens,
all it takes is one point.
One decisive point that
can make or break your confidence...
and completely determine
the outcome ofa match.
- Game-- Miss Rupesi ndhe.
- advantage-- Colt.
Well, there's no trophy here today
on number two court.
Peter Colt
is firmly in control.
Thankyou.
and incredibly,just two points away...
from the Wimbledon final on Sunday
against america's Jake Hammond.
Come on, pete!
Quiet please.
-  That was an almost
impossible passing shot. Match point.
- Yes!
and he seems to be
having trouble getting up
from that awkward tumble just now.
peter CoIt's clearlyin pain.
- Shit.
-  It's hard to tell.
This could spell disaster for the man
who's captured the hearts--
Come on, Son. Come on. Come on.
Pickyourself up. You can do it.
Mr. Colt, areyou okay?
It's my back.
Can you get up?
I'm not entirely sure.
One more point. Come on.
He can't actually hearyou.
- Oh, yes, he can.
- This is an eerie echo
ofthe Tom Cavendish match.
- Well, he's back on his feet.
- Oh, yes, he can.
- Well, only he knows
how much it's hurting him.
- Oh, my God! The stress.
How does he deal with it?
How does who deal with it?
-
-
Oh, my back!
My back is killing me.
But rememberyou're one point
away from the finals.
i'dlove to see an English guy
in the finals, but give me a break.
Do you remember australia?
Your shoulder was killing you,
and what did you do then?
all right. all right. all right!
peter Colt is the luckiest man in tennis.
This is gonna hurt.
Game, set, match-- Colt.
Colt wins three sets to love:
Yes!
I knew he could do it.
Who would have bet, two weeks ago,
that the man time had forgotten,
Rabbit. Caught it
messing with your lettuce.
Good man.
Congratulations, Peter.
Can we just do a quickie?
No, not right now.
How'd she do?
it'sjust one ofthose days
where i couldn't do anything wrong,
and Lizzie just couldn't
do anything right.
That would include accepting defeat,
which Ms. Bradbury found very difficult today.
Bugger.
It's not as if
she can blameyou, is it?
I told you I needed to focus,
to be away from you
forjust a few days.
But, no, instead you sneak into my room,
you don't even have the decency
to spend the night--
- I had the earliest start,
and I thought you'd want the extra sleep.
- I was some chickyou picked up.
- Well, this chick is going back home
to work on her serve.
-
Lizzie, I am sorry aboutyour match.
I really am. But please don't go.
Becauseyou need
to screw me before the finals.
That's whyyou think I'm here?
It's not. Really, Peter?
Not even just a little bit?
aha! Yousee?
i knowyou want me to think...
that we're falling in love
or some bullshit,
but the only thing you
fell in love with this weekwas winning.
- That is absolutely not true.
- Oh, yes, it is.
and you know what? I love winning too.
More than anything. More than anyone.
- Don't say that. You don't mean it.
- I do.
Love means nothing in tennis.
Zero. It only means you lose.

some common ground at long last.
- Oh, really. What's that?
- You, Peter.
You're, uh, probably aware
that things have been a bit
sticky for the last few,
well, years actually.
The fact is that, uh,
in the end, the only thing we shared
was the downstairs toilet,
and she wasn't really keen on that.
I thinkwhat I'm trying to say is that...
we'd forgotten just what
an inspiration you are to both of us.
That's meant to be
the otherway around actually, I know.
But how very proud we are ofyou.
It's been a long time since
we've done this.
Too bloody long.
Dad?
Hmm?

Oh, God.
Well, it's been quite
a fortnight, hasn't it?
Not just for Peter,
but for all of us.
I, for one, will admit--
and that's not a word I like very much.
But we could all do better...
to love and support
each other unconditionally.
Without judgment, without--
- For God's sake, Carl, stop biting
your fingernails. You're not a bloody infant!

- You were saying, darling?
- Yes, I'm sorry.
I just wanted to propose a toast.
To the family. Our family.
It's a trick.

Oh, bloody marvelous.
No, darling. We're bad luck.
Ifwe came and you lost,

Listen, win or lose,
and I can't see how
I'm possibly going to win,

it's the big finals.

Now, i'm starting to think--

and it's here. it is Wimbledon finals day.

and I don't even like tennis.
Ready, sir?
Yeah, I think I am.
peterColt, seen here in his teens,
has already declared this to be
his last competitive match.
and what an exit.
Only a matter of days ago,
Colt had become no more
than a fading blip on the radar
oftennis history.
Now he's become the man who--
Not to add the pressure, Peter,
butyou know the entire United Kingdom
is cheering you on today.
Yes. Well, let's hope
I don't disappoint them.
Did you have any realistic hope
two weeks ago thatyou would
be here today preparing to walk onto--
Lizzie, I loveyou more than life itself,
but I can't turn off every goddamned
television set in the United Kingdom.
I'm going for a walk.
Flight board's in halfan hour.
What doyou attribute this
remarkable run to?
You were supposed
to make a very early exit.
Well, I had a bit of luck against
Tom Cavendish in the quarters,
and I played a more focused game--
passionate game, uh--
I suppose the real answer
toyour question is, uh,
well, love really.
Love ofthe game?
Yeah, love ofthe game. Um--
But, listen, you may have read about
Lizzie Bradbury and myself...
being involved, so to speak.
But, um, i'dlike to take this opportunity
to set the recordstraight.
i read the papers this morning,
and, uh, they seem to imply...
that Lizzie had let me down
i n some way.
That'sjust not the case.
The truth is i let her down.
I let her down, and for that...
I 'll always be truly sorry.
Listen, i'm not in the habit...
of pouring my heart out
on television.
I'm not really in the habit
of pouring my heart out at all.
Lizzie, sweetheart, something
I thinkyou ought to see.
I'm seeing it.
So ifthis comes outwrong,
forgive me.
Lizzie Bradbury.
Lizzie is the reason that I'm here today.
That's all I really came here
to say except thankyou.
Thankyou, peter.
I, uh, have a new theory
of our life oftennis.
Tell me.
Oh, it's simple really.
You hit the ball
back over the net...
as hard and as deep...
and as often
as possible.
Sorry to disturbyou, Peter.
The members have invited you to use
the number one dressing room.
Oh, no. Thankyou, Danny.
I think I'd rather stay here.
Right. That's what
I told 'em you'd say.
Good luck, my friend.
in a fewminutes, Colt and Hammond
will be making the walk...
through the tunnel
onto center court.
a little stroll, Chrissy, that i'm sure you'd
agree is about the number one highlight
ofa tennis player's career.
Except for the butterflies
i always felt, absolutely.
No, he can 'tjust wear the hat.
No, we don't 'cause we don't
have an endorsement deal.
That's why.
Well, then he knows the number.
peter.
I tried to warn you about her.
By the way,
how's the weak back?
It's fine. Thanks.
How's the weak mind?
Gentlemen.
Fuck a duck.
Jake Hammond has been
on an absolute tear.
He's lost only one set
this entire tournament.
and look who he's had to beat.
Hewitt, Federer.
Well, with the exception
of Dragomir and Tom Cavendish,
CoIt's road to this final
has been a relative pushover.
Right. But he's played
some great tennis.
But myguess here is that he's more
than a little overmatched today.
First set. Hammond to serve.
I gotta go.
Peter! Peter! Peter!
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet please.
Ready.
Play.
Yes, thanks.
i'll be needing that.
He said, "Thanks.
I'll be needing that."
- Quiet please.
-  Go,Jake! Come on,Jake.
Oh, thatpoorkid!
He was on the receiving end
ofone ofthe fastest-recorded
serves in professional tennis.
Well, we certainly
hope he 's all right.
and that reminds me
how lucky i was, Chrissy.
i ball-boy'd in the old days
when they used wood rackets.
and things were a lot slower.
Oh, you bastard.
I t's one thi ng to hum i I iate me,
but you didn't have to mess
with the boy.
Now you're going down,
you bastard.
- Ormaybe not.
- Colt to serve.
Love-1 5.
Love-40.
Game-- Hammond.
Game and this set--
Hammond.
Game-- Hammond.
New balls, please.
Love-1 5.
Hammond leads five games to two.
Game-- Hammond.
Love-30.
peterColt finds himself
once again at break point.
He really can't afford to go down
another break this early in the third set.
He seems completely lost
out there,John.
Lost and confused.
We may be witnessing...
the near total collapse
ofa player's game.
at a moment like this, Chrissy,
you have to wonder...
what the hell is going through
peter CoIt's mind.
Please, God.
Please make it end.
Game-- Hammond. playsuspended.
What are you doing, lad?
Get in here.
I t ain't over
till the handshake, lad.
Danny, I'm not really in the mood
for a pep talk right now.
Well, you better
get ready for one.
Hi.
I thoughtyou'd gone.
Yeah. Me too.
Having a tough day?
Well, you know, disastrous.
Except for the fact thatyou didn't
go gooeywhen the ball boy got hit.
Yeah. Sorry.
Why areyou British
apologizing all the time?
Don't apologize to me.
I loveyou.
apologize to the people
who are rooting foryou out there.
What'd you say?
I said that the whole country
has been waiting--
No. No. The other bit.
I said I loveyou.
See, that's very good news.
I thought I was alone
in the love department.
Well, turns out
you've got company.
I am so sorry.
Ifyou say sorry one more time,
you're going to be sorry.
I meant about the other night.
Shh! Stop it.
Forget about that.
This is aboutyou.
Go out there and decide
whoyou are.
and who might that be?
That might be a winner.
Please be patient, Mr. Hammond.
Please sit down.
The question is, where's peter Colt?
Did he flee the building
with the rain?
I think he's in the lavatory.
Isn't that a comfort break?
Is it?
Yes. They are allowed one.
Ifhe's got a jumpy tummy.
So, ifhe doesn't come back--
He's gonna lose.
Of course I want to win. I do.
But he's just better than me.
No. He's not.
I'm two sets down.
My back's killing me.
You're going to play through the pain.
I'm too tired.
My legs are like lead.
Find a second wind.
It's whatwinners do.
His serve is unstoppable.
No, it's not.
It's a bundle oftells.
- What?
- His serve.
It's like a book. You just
have to know how to read it.
You know i reallydon't care who wins.
i mean, i represent both players.
It's like asking me
which one of my kids I love more.
Which one of my kids
do I love more?
My daughter.
I'll talk to you later.
Well, peter Colt is back.
Let's hope he's better.
So farthis match
has been a blowout.
Yeah, Pete! Peter!
Ladies and gentlemen,
as play resumes, Hammond leads...
two sets to love
and one game to love.
Hammond to serve. play.
Go, pete!
ifhe bounces the ball once
instead oftwice,
he's going for the body.
ifhe shifts back on his left heel
and shows you his toe,
it means he's hitting deep.
Colt sure seemed
to have Hammond's
number on that one, Chrissy.
Which is a good sign ifhe 's
gonna climb out ofthe giant hole
he 's dug himself.
Ouch. You al I ri ght?
Yeah.
Welcome back.
Same to you, sir.
Station ident ready to roll.
Eight, top ofyourshot.
We got a visitor.
John, did you see who just came in?
That'll give an immediate
adrenaline burst.
- Yes!
- He did it, Chrissy.
He pulled out the set.
Oh!
Yes!
after a great comeback in the third set,
CoIt's game has leveled.
and he andJake Hammond
are even at 5-all in this tie-break.
So,John, this next point
is crucial...
ifColt wants to keep
this comeback alive.
Come on, Peter!
Okay. 5-5 in the breaker.
Here we go.
Jake Hammond is up 6-5
in the tie-breaker,
and he 's finally gotten himself
a championship point.
This could be the final point
ofpeter CoIt's pro career.
Ri ght here, ri ght now.
- Ladies and gentlemen, quiet please.
- This could be it, Chrissy.
I-If his heel moves left,
he's going right.
Or is it the toss? Yes.
I-I-Ifhe tosses high, i-it--
Oh, sod it!
- 6-all.
- incredible point.
i'm doin'a complete 180
on peter Colt.
This is amazing persistence
from thejourneyman player.
i was already thinking
about gettin' to the airport.
We may be going to a fifth set,
and ifi was Jake Hammond,
i'd want to close
this thing out right now.
The last thing he wants is another set
with the momentum going
in the other direction.
Okay. First one to win by two.
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet please.
Wow. a double fault.
Now it looks like Hammond's
the one who 's getting tight.
Peter Colt now has set poi nt
to force a fifth and decidi ng set.
- aw, give us a goddamn break!
-
please, shut off
all mobile phones. Thankyou.
Yeah.
unbelievable!
We're gonna play five!

Rising star Peter Colt
has battled back.
Game-- Colt.
Peter Colt-san.
Game point.
Colt leads five games to four.
Final set.
Well, Colt has brokenJake Hammond.
and after this changeover,
he's gonna be serving
for the Wimbledon title.
Listen, an hour ago,
i didn 't think he 'd find anybody
to give him a ride home.
No question,John.
and now it's all up to him.
i mean, he 's finally got a chance
to serve out the match.
Time.
Break you ri ght back, asshole.
Didyou see that?
That is some definite gamesmanship
from Jake Hammond.
Come on, Peter.
Come on!
peter Colt is now three points away
from winning Wimbledon.
One poi nt at a ti me, Peter.
One point at a time.
It's just another point.
It's just another point.
Like hell it is. You could be
the champion ofWimbledon,
which means you wouldn't have to
take the projob for starters.
You could buy a new place, redecorate.
Lizzie could help with that.
Oh, God knows
what taste she has.
Oh, shut up, you silly ponce.
Make that two points away, Chrissy.
-  Come on, peter!
- Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet please.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Come on, Pete.
Chrissy, we talked about
CoIt's reputation in the past...
as a choker when
it comes to big points.
Well, this is primo choke time.
i wouldn't be surprised
ifColt got real tight now.
Thank you.
I t's my fault.
peter! peter! peter!
Don't choke. Don't choke.
Don't choke. Don't choke.
Please don't choke.
Please don't choke. Don't choke.
I'm not gonna choke, damn it.
peter!
Doyou believe it? peter Colt
is serving a championship point.
Quiet please.
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet please.
Championship point.
Right then.
- Out.
- 40-30.
-  i don't believe it.
That was a terrible call for Colt.
- No!
- What the hell?
- What?
-
- Look at the chalk fly.
The ball was definitely in.
- It was on the line.
- It was on the line!
I'd be torching
the stadium about now.
Excuse me!
The ball was good.
Oh, come on. The ball was good.
Chalk flew up.
The whole stadium saw it.
I don't know ifyou've noticed,
but it's quite an important point.
That's too close for me to overrule.
Please resume play.
absolutely not. I'm not playing.
This is complete bollocks.
- absolutely bollocks.
-  Code violation.
Unsportsmanlike conduct.
Warning, Mr. Colt.
-  in! in! in!
- Oh, my--
Okay, here we go.
peter Colt has his second chance now
to win the championship.
The question is, can he do it?
after a call like that...
a lot ofplayers,
includingyours truly,
would have a hard time
getting back in the mind-set.
Ladies and gentlemen,
quiet please.
-
-  That serve wasn't even close.
it wasn't fast either.
i believe you
to be a truly great tennis player.
-  ultimately disappointing.
-
Total collapse ofa player's--
Stop it. You have to stop it.
Now.
Yes!
He's done it! He has done it!
Thejourneyman has won!
a wild card entry.
Ranked 1 1 9th in the world.
Now champion ofWimbledon!
Cal I Letterman. Cal I Leno.
Cal I Oprah. Cal I Ki m mel.

i've never seen anything
like this in my life.
The Brits finally have a winner.
What's wrong with you?
You bet on J ake?
I bet it al I on you, bro!
Can I retire now, Mum!
Certainly not!
augusta!
Well done, Son. We love you.
He seems to be lookin'
forsomebody else.
i think the whole world
knows who he's lookin'for.
There's so much
I want to say to you.
I 'm not going anywhere.
Oh, yes, you are.
You're going a long, long way.
Nothing couldpossibly
match that moment.
it's everythingyou wait
a lifetime for.
That dream finally come true.
What else could ever come close?
Except this, maybe.
i did take a job at a club.
But teachingyoung kids
like my own, not old ladies.
Yeah!
and i love it.
i beatyou. i beatyou.
Rubbish. The bal I was in.
I t was definite-- Ow!
Well, most ofthe time.
You see, a part ofme was always
afraid that my life would be over
ifi wasn't playing tennis.
But the truth is, it was
reallyjust beginning.
Oh, and by the way,
Lizzie did win the u.S. Open.
and Wimbledon.
Twice.
