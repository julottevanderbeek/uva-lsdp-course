Love Me If You Dare
I like this game very much.
Housing game, when the the banker lost.
I like bead game, I win;
Jumping game is for fools.
Unless girls.
I don't play guessing game; the
house-jumping is quite good for two persons.
Hide-and-seek is
quite good too.
But you can't play one game.
I say, never.
Even your best friend suggests.
It's a game that bury yourself
into a heap of concrete.
This game started
with a beautiful house.
A bus without driver.
A beautiful box.
A beautiful friend.
In fact, I made a mistake.
This game started long long ago.
It started with a sick word.
Like: Transfer.
Why not mammouth?
This made mother crys.
In all, doctor, thay
don't like anything.
Your situation is very
urgent...They all talk nonsense.
Their trousers are too bad.
Look! Imagine that what
they know about mothers.
Also some unlovely word, Like Kowalsky.
Don't search anymore. I
don't want to refer it.
Kowalsky.
Polish! And.
Don't forget the disgusting faces.
All this is the same thing.
That is "I don't feel well".
"No one feels so bad like
me on the Earth and Mars."
You love her. Wei?
Me too. I think she is
very pretty. Give it to me.
This is really cowry, right?
Oh! I have never seen a beautiful
rounded playground like this.
Never, never.
No. I have seen it, but not on Earth.
Me too.
Where? Is it real? Does it really exit?
Yes. My angel, here.
And here.
And here.
Julien, you go by bus tomorrow morning.
I will stay with mother for some time.
Let's go.
Go, go, My Juju, go.
Mother! You forget your cowry. Keep it.
My only cowry is you.
Oh...
Ok.
Oh! Dirty Polish.
Oh! Dirty Polish.
Sophie? No. I am a dirty Polish.
Oh! dirty Polish.
There isn't any precious
things that day with Sophie.
So I will share with her.
Will you pay me back?
If you really want it,
please prove it. Dare you?
This is the start.
All the things begin.
My bus! Oh, no.
Dare.
What did you do? Please answer me.
Nothing.
I don't want to be hurt! Stop.
Stop! Shut up!
Julien! I don't want to be hurt.
He will not. He dare not..
Don't beat him.
You don't have the right to beat him.
Shut up! Think twice.
Father doesn't like Sophie.
He doesn't like her from the beginning.
The game started successfully.
If the box is in her hand,
she asks me to prove it.
I do it to win the box back.
So I give Sophie a guaranty.
It is absurd, isn't it?
Foolish game? Perhaps.
But this is our game.
Please show me some common
nouns begin with "A".
One.
One.
"Animals".
Any else? Sylvie?
Abricot.Very good.
Abricot.Very good.
The common nouns begin with "B", Sophie?

Go to the headmaster's office.
I'll see weather you laugh or not.
Julien, what are you
doing? Go with Sophie.
Go to the headmaster's office.
"Bander".
What? Bander begins with "B".
Discipline.
Discipline is the basic of respect.
Without respect, it's
the end of civilization.
Most residents.
Came down.
Corrupt politics! Whose
contribution is it?
Miss Kowalsky and Mr. Janvier!
Dare. Say it again, Mr. Janvier.
Let me share it.
What do your poor brain think of?
Dare you interrupt me?
Imagine it, sir.
It's really a great
game, but no one laughs.
Detach them.
Detach them, miss.
We are detached.
They never dare to do so.
Mr. Janvier, please
meet with miss Kowalsky.
Great spirits meets.
Do you know what the
word "punish" means?
You have comsidered.
Is it the future prepared for her? Ok.
I am not her mother.
Vulgarity is not in the lessons.
Miss Kowalsky!
I will meet your parents.
They don't speak
French. "Bite" in Polish.
Called hammer. Anything else?
Please wait, there must be your profits.
Don't go out or watch TV.
Don't eat sweets.
DOn't use light in the aisle.
Go to get your coat.
No. It's enough. Cool.
Did you do the same thing like me?
Go to your room! Don't disturb mother.
Julien!
Julien...Mother!
We have a good meal!
You are in bed that time.
You are lucky.
You know, My Julien...A
doctor came to see me.
I made five mistakes. Do you know?
Juju...I made ten
mistakes in the elocnte.
Do you want to lister?
I also did a very silly thing.
Friends are like glasses.

Close your ears, close your ears hardly.
Can you hear how I love you?
It's most important.

Sophie writes with teeth.
It is important, isn't it?
Now one can attract you like Sophie.
Alice can not, your mother can not.
Ok. Use teeth.
How does she deal with ears?
Can you? Climb alone rops
with your eyes shut out?
Cup on head.
I don't believe you.
Do you think you are the
first playing "Dare or not"?
Ok. Good night.

Right! On the morning,

Oh. blamed, blamed.
What's the time?

No, this morning.
This morning, Sophie will wear her bra.
Game starts again.
Miss Kowalsky.
Kowalsky, Sophie.Kowalsky.
The game's rule is silly.
Someone fooled before
changed opposite now.
Do you know what is changing opposite?
Only something about taste.
I am Julien. I am "Go away."
Make my life significative.
Just like play Beethoven on
the blackboard by fingers.
Miss Kowalsky.
Function vectorielle...
V1xV2 gets the same result as 2 modules.
multiple by the cosine of
the angle which forms them
You seem good at Function vectorielle.
Tell me weather I make a mistake or not.
Miss Kowalsky.
Tell me whether I was wrong.
Your vector begins with a point,
And defined by a fixed amount,
Which is more attractive than others.
Do you think you can do some
research on this theory with me?
This will be an index number.
Do you usually review
by yourself?    En¡­
This makes me deaf.

To leave here.
f has two different roots.
If m is between -1 and 1/3
I'll go, this is my
sister. What a pity man.
Be louder, I can't hear.
It works, isn't it? I did it;
don't keep such a straight face.
What can you do except seduce women?
The chief examiner
didn't have a good name.
She thought you are Kawasaky
It's the result to chew up
No result, you get no mark!
I have faced those
executioners for 20 minutes.
See how comfortable you are!
I never know her that bitch.
And she knows nothing about math.
Aurelie Miller, a taint.
To her there's only two things: She
had had sex with the teacher of PE,
And she had awful earrings.
Do you envy her?
Me? Yes.
Go to get a whore, as you like.
So¡­ you are envying.  Forgive me!
If you want to know my opinion of
Aurelie, OK, I wish you success.
You two seems like a pair to death.
Stop. To give her up would be a fault.
Bring me her earrings.
Miss Miller! Aurelie£®Miller
Do you have boyfriend?  Yes.
Now, you have two.
And you? Is that really your sister?
It's she who asked
me to come.   Get out!
If I scream, the school will be here.
No¡­ Oh!
What are you doing?
You are so coquettish, just like my car.
That why I like you.
Miller Aurelie
Is she still not here?
When will we meet again?
The third semester, partly.
Give me your earrings.
Reflect your golden hair on it.
Let your frozen stiff slave
wallow in your earrings.
You are crazy.
You are crazy. Ok, let me go, Ok?
Forget about those
vectors and functions, OK?
-Do you believe love at first sight?
-En, yes.
Na?ve.
Aurelie£®Miller¡­ You failed the exam.
Did my wage make you ill?
How is it?   I don't like blond woman.
You did it! You this son of a bitch!
Tyrant
That's enough! She has nothing at all!
You have forget that PE teacher;
the one with a strong biceps.
I've had sex with him.
His leg? It's just like your QI.
-You like him, this snowman?
-As the second choice, yes.
What do you mean by ¡°as the second
choice¡±? What's the first one?
It's your turn! Hurry up!
Go away!   Be calm!
Do you know the Easter bet?
it seems he doesn't know it.
You are all crazy! No!Igor
Let's talk something else.
Kick his ass.
Say you regret!
That's funny.
Say it!
You should not go.
Look at me carefully, jerk! I dare
do anything; beg me for forgiveness!
You would get nothing.
Bitch, give me the box.
Kiss me, can you?
I can.
I said: kiss me.
Anything wrong with
you? You are all crazy!
Get off my car, and I'll tell you.
Do you hear me? Get off and I tell you.
Do you hear me?!
Get off!!
You are both louts! Idiots!
Hold me
Love me
I can.
Is this a game to you?
No, I bet. You started it.
If I started it, you
would not hold it at once.
Poor taint! You are
going to miss the bus.
He must be older.
As a child, we think
it's a slow process.
But it beats you like a branch.
When someone comes to you,
or your father tells you that:
It's all over! You have unified exam!
Do you remember? Exam,
don't make yourself a loser.
Or I'll announce your
comfortable life an end.
Come on, Dad. It's not
so serious, be gentle.
Be gentle?
You little lout, don't you
feel that I'm now gentle enough?
I'll tell you that
Your game killed my wife
And your mother.
You are so contemptible!   Yes, I am.
I'm a contemptible
person, not a gentleman.
I'm so contemptible that
bring you up alone! Shit!
You are rubbish!   Yes, I am.
I can tear your face.
I can't believe that
Sophie poisoned you.
Poisoned you that you
don't say a word to me.
Unless when your friends
take me as the wager.
You choose it.
She or me, how is it?
Dare¡­
Or dare not?
Sophie!
Hallo, do you want to see
Sophie? She is not here.
What are you doing here?
I told you don't come.
You satisfied? You see
it? Is it interesting?
You promised me
I don't care.   I care!
I see nothing in my eyes,
sorry, I don't know.
Sorry, everything has been changed!
Come on, let's go.   Go where?
Your teenager's room? I
don't need your compassion.
You go by yourself.
Sophie, forgive me!
Go!
Dare or dare not?
You go!
Forgive me, I give a most
difficult bet to Sophie.
But Sophie never like easy.
This takes her a long
time, maybe it's too long.
During that time, my
father persuaded me.
Hallo, sir.
Is Julien here?
Excuse me, Mr. Janvier.
I come here to see Julien.
He is here.
Julien£¬do you hear me?
Keep silent, let me say something.
Do you miss me?
Because I miss you, you this tyrant.
Give you a straight face
is a difficult thing,
But I still feel that
it's not your illusion.
I want to forget the game when
we are talking. Just one time.
Do you like my skirt? I'm hesitating.
I took it from my sister.
There was once a red one.
Red like a nuclear bomb.
I know this is what I need to wear.
I must be sitting in front
of the mirror for 3 hours.
But I did it. See, I'm so beautiful.
I hope you like it,
otherwise I'll beat you.
Wait
What did I say just now?
The problem is
Even you say ¡°I like
it¡±, I'll not trust you.
I don't know when you are in game,
And when you are not.
I've lost myself.
Wait¡­ I'm not finish.
Say you love me.
I can never say this out first.
I'm afraid you think it's a game.
Help me, please.
Thank you.
Hallo.
Hallo.
Julien
Are you reviewing you courses?
It seems you are not.
Not now.
When? Tomorrow?
One year later. I'm sorry.
Don't say sorry to me.
¡° City plan¡±, do you really like this?
You are talking to a
expert, HLM, my speciality.
We had never talked about future.
Us two.
Our two futures.
¡°Our two futures¡±
Spontaneously, I'd say our future.
You need to believe that
present situation satisfied me.
I dream to see us keeping going
like we've been in these years.
You are a idiot.
OK, pass the exam, dare or dare not?
I'm sorry.
¡°I'm sorry, Sophie¡±. Good!
In fact, wa have talked
about future, just once.
Did I make a mistake,
in some place else?
You want to be a tyrant, to me , a flan
Stop! No, I don't want to delay you.
Go ahead with your job, I have exam
too, I investigate human beings.
You learn Sociology. What I
refer to is not human beinngs.
But man.
Male, man, and I have
difficult in review.
Use this, you are in the library.
There is no better place for
review than here, isn't there?
Yes.
Stop, you are doing something stupid.
Stop. Why?
It's just a bet. Come
on, let me work over it.
See you one year later.
What happened?
Hmm
You know what I am saying clearly.
Mo, I don't konw, tell me.
It is not easy to say that.
Can't you wait for one year.
There, in your study.
Be careful.
You want to hurt me, don't
kidding me, you won't.
Wait for me?
This is guaranty?
No.
Then you just go and see.
Sophie!Sophie, I love you.
I love you, I love you, come down.
What a fool.
Look at the fool sitting on the chair.
He makes a strange face
because of his lung.
This is only an excuse.
Isn't it easyer to
hold her in your arms?
Tell her I love her?
You feel your heart beating
when you think of this.
Hey! I am talking to
you! Do you hear that?
Of course you have heard
that, what a snaky fool.
What is worse, your mess is not end.
Do you want something?
Do you have skirt for banquet?
I don't have any banquet.
I will give you two pieces.
I have something to ask you.
What do you like to drink?
A cup of coffee.
A cup of coffee, just this.
Can I have a talk with you. No.
Sorry, but we have something that
we don't agree with each other.
Stupid things... For
example, your shoes.
My shoes? Yes, it is funny.
Your shoes fit your
trousers well, I swear.
It attracts my eyes that I
couldn't hear what you said.
Please.
I won't take it off.
That is you, you want to talk.
Monday, I will be off at
OK. But, in fact,
I have a singing lesson after that.
You sing?
Yes, this is not my
life, it is only a job.
Isn't it the way you make
the hero save you, is it?
I am sorry, but this is the truth.
I don't mean anything else.
I am glad that you
take the singing lesson.
You want to be a singer? The
first thing is to earn money.
You pay 100 pounds
to become Terrisa's mother?
Damn it, I said I wouldn't talk to you.
Your shoes, and your trousers, make
me distracted! Let me do my work.
How do you do. How do you do.
How are you? Fine, and you?
Very well.
Can I invite you now?
No.
Where are you going? Don't
ask so many questions.
Monday, you will be off at 7PM.
Today is Tuesday.
Today is Tuesday.
Wait for me.
I want to invite you for dinner.
Go away! You too?
A serious traffic jam, a truck wants to
Drive back... Have
you got a lover? What?
Have you got a lover?
Why you ask me so? Nothing.
It's about the inside
contradition oratory
Contradition oratory! That
is conversation, isn't it?
So, do you have a lover?
You don't have to answer,
it is only a question.
I don't have someone else
in bed, if you want to know.
He is a soccer player,
Sergei Nimov Nimovitch
Forget it, I've give
him up this morning.
How cant you go out
with such arrant person?
I am tired of staying out for night.
Is there nobody else since this morning?
Except for Sergei? Greg, his
friend, Jerome and his father.
A French, two and three Kevin's
Prince Cendrillon
They are not serious, just for fun.
Very beautiful restaurant!
Champagne, please.
You did a good job. I
think you are tempting me.
Is this so impossible in your eyes?
Have you seen the girl downstairs?
Her skirt
is the same with the
one I dressed before.
How long ago? Four years?
I have seen it.
That doesn't fit her.
What a dress up person.
Did I look so stupid before?
Don't say that, you don't know her.
You didn't either.
Does it matter?
Hey, have you got the certificate?
My certificate is nothing remarkable.
Cheers.
Cheers for this moment, and
the things I have done for you.
I have waited for
years to tell you this.
Tell me what?
Tell you myself.
But you have been talking about youself.
Then say something.
My heart,
Sophie, I have got a lover.
You have got a lover...
Just this? No, not like this.
For years, keep silent for years.
I want to marry,
Do you agree?
You are asking me ?
You remember.
Did I say I want to marry you?
Yes you did. What did you say?
You... you really want to marry?
Because I need you.
Of course, marriage, is not
only one person's matter.
You keep them for the day you marry.
Listen, this.
Do you agree?
You agree?
You agreed.
She agree! She agree.
You will be my chief
witness at wedding ceremony
Thank you, Sophie, I will introduce you.

You can never fuck her.
You pray for your life,not control it.
No,dad.
Stop!  Okay,i stop
I stop everything.
Look at me,Julien,look at me.
It's the last time  you look at me.
You've looked my face
enough,now it's over.
The game is over.
You don't exist anymore!
You are deleted in my life.
A girl's lies...
Don't do this,it's a game.  Let go of me
What a magnific bad woman.
This kind of friend,things
can only be in this way.
Isn't she great? Be ready all the time.
Be scrunched by a
train.That's just a joke.
A kid's bet
Julien!
What's marriage?
Beautiful suits,champagne
Some cream dessert. That's enough
Okay,you can do it next week.
Julien!
You love yourself,this is
the important thing,isn't it?
Julien,do you hear me?
I can be a real chief
witness at your wedding.
I'll be serious,I swear.
I won't spit.
What's this?
Julien!
Julien,can I move?
Julien,don't joke.
Go to hell.
Okay,you go with me.
We haven't seen each other for 10 years.
Coming!
Sophie!
Don't say anything,Sergei
Hey?
Nothing.
Where is it?The proposition
from the Club of D1?
I don't know,i've not called them.
Okay,we don't need to
see each other again.
If you want to cast me away for weeks
Make a reservation. I've done
enough with small savings.
I don't live with a "football player"
Do you think you can hold
me by your poor salary?
I will make some money.
I want big money.
The big bingo,the super
cagnotte on Friday,13th.
I'm good for that,right?
Yes.
And here,it's the worst.
Nothing,it's nothing in 10 years
After 3652 days and 3653
nights,I got nothing.
The game is over,game!The
thrill of my existance.
I'm wandering in my life,
just like wandering in
the tragedies of Racine.
Hermione verion man
Where am I? What have I
done? What should I do?
What kind of passion has catched me?
What kind of sorrow licks me up?
"Can't I know whether I love or I hate?"
Sophie murdered me,
butchered me, killed me.
Raped me.
There are also many crazy feet.
And, I feel it incomplete at last.
Bring me to the happy that never
experience since I was born.
Love, family, work, paraboloid attenna.
Racine, I said.
The final one.
Julien! The dustbin.
Julien, rubbish.

He doesn't need you.
Are you okay,Madame Janvier?
Speaking the truth,this time,
I'm really angry at her.
I want her to have a rough
time, then, I would forgive her.
We are smiling at the end.
After all, it's a game.

For example?
Eat ants.
Abuse the unemployed men of ANPE.
Love you like a bedlamite.
Look! We win it like this.
Together, happy.
Finally at the bottom of the concrete,
we share our dream in childhood.
A love dream with no final.
