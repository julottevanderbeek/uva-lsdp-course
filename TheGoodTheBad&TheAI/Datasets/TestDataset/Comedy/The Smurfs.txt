NARRATOR: There is a place.
A place that knows no sadness.
Where even feeling blue
is a happy thing.
A place inhabited
by little blue beings
three apples high.
It lies deep
in an enchanted forest,
hidden away beyond
a medieval village.
Most people believe
this place is made up,
only to be found in books
or in children's imaginations.
well,
we beg to differ.
Whoo! Yeah!
Come on, Farmer!
Yee-haw!
I'm going in!
Whoo!
All right, Greedy,
I'm gonna race you!
Whoa! Yes!
whoa, golly!
Whoo! Farm boys
love to fly!
Oh, yeah! So excited!
Now you see us,
now you don't!
Three, two, one.
Oh, yeah!
FARMER: Whoo-hoo!
Oh, yeah!
I love smurfberries!
Hey, hey!
The blue ones are mine!
ALL!  La la la la la la
la la la la la
La la la la la la
la la la la la
Oh, no!
I'm late for rehearsal!
I am so late!
NARRATOR: In Smurf village,
each and every Smurf
plays their own special part.
Whoa, Nellie!
Sorry, Handy!
No problem, Clumsy.
You keep me employed!
Which gives the Smurfs
a sense of harmony.
Hey, Baker! Nice pies!
No worries, Clumsy.
And tranquility.
Great sign, guys!
Whether it's Handy Smurf,
the builder.
I can't stay.
Rehearsal time!
Baker Smurf. Whoa!
Hey, Narrator Smurf!
Oh, hello, Clumsy!
Just rehearsing the intro
for the Blue Moon Festival!
Mmm. Pizza!
Pardon me! Pardon me!
Hey, Chef Smurf!
Clumsy! Help!
I just invented
frozen pizzas! Genius!
Whoa! Smurf on the loose!
Hey, Clumsy.
Hey, guys!
Hi, Jokey!
Hi, Clumsy.
Whoo! Who's clumsy now, huh?
Hey, what do you get
when you cross
a Smurf with a cow?
Blue cheese!
I got you a present.
Oh, no, thanks, Jokey.
I'm late for rehearsal!
But, wait! I...
ALL:  La la la la la la...
Hey, Grouchy.
Hey, Gutsy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow your roll, sailor.
Hey, wait, wait.
Isn't that the rehearsal
for the Blue Moon Festival?
What can I say, Clumsy?
You're not on the list.
Grouchy, it's right there.
Right. Under
"Do not let in Clumsy."
Clearly you two
lack the verbal
skills required
to explain this
predicament succinctly.
Hey!
Here we go.
You see, Clumsy,
the other Smurfs don't
want to dance with you
for fear of what
are politely called
"fractures."
How could
anybody think that?
That's gonna leave
a big blue bruise.
Wonderful! Beautiful!
Oh! Marvelous.
MALE SMURF: Watch it, there!
Oh! Cut! Cut! Cut!
It's a dance,
not dominoes.
Ahhh! A worry line!
MALE SMURF: All right, don't
get your petals in a twist.
As happy and as perfect as
life in Smurf village is,
even sunshine and butterflies
must have their dark clouds.
And for all Smurfs,
that dark cloud has one name.
Gargamel, the evil wizard.
GARGAMEL:
La la la la la la
Sing a happy song
La la la la la la
This is so wrong
"I'm Papa Smurf.
"I'm the head of a small
group of blue people
"and live in the forest
with 99 sons and one daughter.
"Nothing weird
about that, no, no.
"Totally normal."
"Oh, and I'm Smurfette.
And I think I'm so pretty.
"And I betrayed Gargamel,
and I don't even care.
"And everything is just
sunshine and rainbows."
But all of that
is about to change.
I said, "All of that
is about to change."
Azrael, that's your cue!
That's your cue to pounce
on the miserable beasts
in some kind of
a rage-induced
feline frenzy.
Yes, good.
Yeah. More rage.
Hey, but don't go crazy.
These are the only
puppets I have.
I am not obsessed
with Smurfs, thank you.
I simply can't stop thinking
about the miserable beasts
every single minute
of every single day.
'Cause I need them!
It is only by capturing
the little wretches
and extracting
their happy blue essence
that my magic will
finally become...
Not infallible.
Invincible!
Yes. Thank you.
I shall become
the most powerful wizard
in all of the world.
Yeah, but you're milking it.
Don't milk it.
"O great one?"
Yes, lying, deceptive,
horrible little Smurfette?
"After all your years of
Smurf-less searching,
"how ever do you
expect to find us?"
I'm very glad
you asked, my dear.
For, you see,
I have a magical map
that shows me exactly where
the smurfroot grows!
I shall now use
my formidable powers
to magically
transport us here!
Come, my little
fish-breathed friend!
Alakazoop!
Great.
Ye gods, Azrael.
You're a boy?
We really need
that Smurf essence.
Alakazamp!
MALE SMURF:
Now tie it off right there!
PAPA:
Ah! That blue moon
time of year again.
Time to smurf some magic.
Summon a vision and
see what our future holds.
I must get the visioning
potion just right.
The magic is always strongest
during the blue moon.
Ah!
So far, so good.
Lots of smiles
and smurfberries.
Clumsy's sitting still.
That's always good.
A dragon wand.
I got it! I got it!
Clumsy.
Help! Save us!
Papa!
Papa!
Oh, Clumsy,
what have you done?
Hey, Papa.
Clumsy?
Are you okay?
Yes. Fine.
Why aren't you rehearsing for
the Blue Moon celebration?
Oh! You know.
A couple guys got
smacked in the face,
so I thought I'd make
some smurfroot mud packs
to take down
everyone's swelling.
Oh.
Aw, Papa, you're smurf
out of smurfroot.
I'll go pick some.
No! Those fields are too
close to Gargamel's castle.
I'll get the smurfroot.
You stay in the village
and out of trouble.
Do you understand?
Okay. If you say so.
A vision's never been wrong.
I can't let this
happen to my Smurfs.
"Just stay in the village,
Clumsy."
Ha! Look at
all this smurfroot.
They are gonna be
so proud of me.
Let's see,
just a few more...
Boo.
Gargamel!
Help!
Good kitty.
Good kitty.
Look! Look!
A ball of yarn!
A nice, juicy bird! Ahhh!
So, that's it!
Oh! It's invisible.
Oh! Those sneaky...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
We don't know if it's safe.
Azrael?
Are you dead?
So, what did you see
in your vision, Papa?
Nothing
apocalyptic, really.
Everything's going
to be just fine.
Perfect. Another year
we don't have
to worry about
that mean, old...
Gargamel!
I know who she meant,
Clumsy.
No, no! Gargamel!
I mighta, kinda, sorta
accidentally led him to
the village.
Gargamel!
Smurf for your lives!
Everybody skedaddle!
Into the forest, Smurfs!
SMURFETTE:
Come on, Clumsy!
Sound the alarm, Crazy.
This is really bad!
Smurfs, that way!
Hey, cat! Azrael,
over here! Come on!
There you go,
you nasty cat.
MALE SMURF 1: This way!
MALE SMURF 2: This is no joke!
MALE SMURF 3: Look out!
Papa!
Let go! Cursed nature!
Here comes papa, Papa!
Papa, your primitive
little defenses,
they're useless
against me, sir!
I laugh at them.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
How's that
for primitive, Gargamel?
Maybe this will
all blow over.
I can fix this.
I just gotta think.
Yes!
Follow me, everyone!
Save yourselves!
Clumsy! You're
going the wrong way!
He's headed for
the Forbidden Falls!
With the blue moon coming?
Quickly, Smurfs! Stop him!
Unbelievable!
The one time
we want him to trip and
he's running perfectly!
Clumsy!
Oh, this is a predicament.
"Agony ahead"!
Anybody reading these signs?
This is a predicament!
This guy's killing me!
Looks like we're down
to 99 Smurfs!
This is not good at all.
Whoa!
SMURFETTE: Clumsy!
Help!
Well, we tried. Let's go.
Hold on, lad!
We'll form a Smurf
bridge to get you.
BRAINY:
Not the Smurf bridge!
GUTSY: There we go.
BRAINY: Yeah, pardon me.
This is not a Smurf bridge,
it's clearly a chain...
ALL: Smurf it, Brainy!
The blue moon!
Oh, dear.
What's happening, Papa?
GUTSY: What the blinking
flip is that?
Oh, no!
The vision!
SMURFETTE: Come on, guys!
Pull him up!
Hurry!
Don't let go!
Help!
Help!
GROUCHY:
Look out for the hole!
No, it's more of a vortex.
Or a portal.
Smurf up! it's a hole. Ahhh!
Hold on!
Oh, no!
Looks like you got
the short end
of the stick, eh, Papa?
Now you belong to me!
Not this time, Gargamel!
What's wrong with you?
That was great!
Let's have another go.
Are you smurfed?
We almost died in there!
SMURFETTE:
We're not even wet.
What part of the enchanted
forest is this?
My calculations indicate...
That's slimy.
I don't think we're in
Smurf village anymore.
PAPA: Oh, my.
Uh...
Smurfs? You may want to
take a look at this.
What is it?
Why are we listening to him?
He just got us sucked
through a giant hole.
It's not a hole,
it's a vortex.
And can't we just
go around the rock?
BRAINY: Whoa!
Oh, my smurf.
Where the smurf are we?
Up the smurfing creek
without a paddle,
that's where.
Well, at least they're
not coming after us.
GROUCHY: Oh, yeah. Really?
PAPA: Oh, dear.
Azrael!
Run!
GROUCHY: Not again!
Azrael? Are you dead?
Must have Smurfs!
We'll circle back
when it's safe!
GROUCHY: Run!
Guys, come on!
GUTSY: Go!
BRAINY: Coming through!
GROUCHY: I'm getting hungry!
PATRICK: Hey, how are you?
Yeah, nice to see you.
Enjoy the party.
Oh, hey, can we get
the photographer over there?
There's big
arrivals happening.
Thanks. Welcome.
Hey, ladies, looking good.
A couple quick, quick tips.
If you could not stand
directly in
front of the display,
but over to the sides,
it'd be a bit more visible.
Hey, look, product.
Also, don't forget to smile.
Remember, you're working
for a cosmetics company.
That's it.
Smile, relax, everyone
will have a good time.
GROUCHY: Let's go!
Thanks. Thank you so much.
PAPA: Hurry!
Hello, Henri.
On top of everything
with the campaign, Patrick?
Well, as much as l can be.
We certainly did our homework.
We tested the results.
ODILE: Patrick!
She's pointing at me.
That can't be good.
FEMALE REPORTER:
Odile, it looks fantastic
for Thursday's launch.
ODILE: It's gonna
be quite the gala.
Oh, there he is.
My new vice president
of marketing.
So, wait, you fired Ralph?
His campaign was rubbish.
He gave me what I asked for,
not what I want.
Can you give me
what I want?
Is that what
you're asking for?
How would I know
what I'm asking for
when I don't even
know what I want?
Well said, Odile. Well said.
That's why you need me.
Exacto! I need you to create
a new campaign for Jouvenel.
All digital, of course,
so it can be ready
on time for the launch.
Odile, that's two days.
Si, mi corazÃ³n,
and it mustn't be delayed.
Is that going
to be a problem?
No. No, I mean for
a whole new campaign,
it's kind of tight.
But... No,
two days is perfect.
God only needed six days
for the whole world, right?
Fail me, and maybe you can
go and work for him. Hmm?
Where are we, Azrael?
What manner of
freakish realm is this?
Okay, one more
box of research.
Hey, would you get
a cab for me, please?
WOMAN:
Yes, yes, of course.
GROUCHY: This day just keeps
getting better and better.
CLUMSY: So we're just
gonna jump in the portal,
get back to our village
and everybody's happy,
right?
SMURFETTE: Yeah, guys.
Let's stay smurftimistic.
You know what?
I choose to
be pessismurfstic.
We're all gonna die.
Papa Smurf, how do we get home
with the portal closed?
I'm sure when
the blue moon rises tonight,
the portal will open again.
Now, let's take
shelter till dark.
All right,
let's get smurfing.
Okay, but I'm not happy.
Azrael!
Run, Smurfs!
Take that!
SMURFETTE: Guys, come on!
Quick, to the tree!
Let's go!
Smurfette!
My hair! Get back, cat!
Way to go, Smurfette!
Oh, no!
GROUCHY: Take one for
the team, Clumsy!
Help!
PAPA: Clumsy, look out!
Smurf!
SMURFETTE: Clumsy!
BRAINY: Oh, no!
Hey.
Clumsy!
What a numptie.
PAPA: Quickly, to
the mechanical wagon.
GUTSY: Up the tree, Smurfs.
Why don't we just go
around the tree?
There you are.
By all means,
relax here in the fresh
air and the sunshine
while my missing Smurfs
could be anywhere.
What? Where?
GUTSY: Come on!
Try and stay
with me, Smurfs.
PAPA: I'm getting
too old for this.
Slow down! Whoa!
Be careful, Brainy.
Hey. Hey!
Seventh Street,
from First and A, please.
Come on, Smurfs!
BRAINY: I don't
like these heights.
Don't look down.
Come back here,
wretched Smurfs!
SMURFETTE: Hurry!
GROUCHY: We're way up here!
BRAINY:
A jump from this height will
knock the blue out of us!
Ow! My hip.
Papa!
Gargamel!
Oh, dear.
Stop that carriage!
Let's go! Let's go!
Wait, wait.
I forgot my phone.
Come back! Stop there!
Stop that carriage!
Never mind. Here it is.
Knock yourself out,
Gargamel!
GUTSY: You've had that
coming for about 30 years!
Smurfs!
BRAINY: Oh, wow.
SMURFETTE: Whoa!
GUTSY: Whoa!
BRAINY: Castles and palaces
everywhere!
GUTSY: Oh! And green goblins!
SMURFETTE: And red trolls.
GUTSY: And look at
the giant princess!
SMURFETTE: Whoa!
This village is
amazing, Papa.
Yes, and likely
very dangerous.
Until we rescue Clumsy
and get back home,
I need you all to stay close
and do exactly as I say.
Smurf's honor.
If you say so.
You can count on us, Papa.
BRAINY: They can see us!
Camouflage.
Blend in.
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear
PAPA: Well, I guess this
is our stop. Let's go.
SMURFETTE: Yay! we get
to climb another tree.
GUTSY: Watch out, watch out.
Hang on, everybody.
Hang on!
Brainy.
That's it.
PATRICK: Thanks a lot.
Have a good night.
SMURFETTE: I hope Clumsy
can breathe in that box.
How are we supposed to
find Clumsy in there?
I could attempt to smurf
the probability...
SMURFETTE: Brainy!
We'll look through
every window.
I don't do windows.
Now, let's get smurfing.
You heard him. Come on.
GROUCHY: Every window?
Piece of cake.
Grace?
Hello?
Guess what? Guess what,
guess what?
Okay. They invented
a zero-calorie pizza.
No, but that's a good idea.
Yes. They found...
Oh!
Baby kicked.
Aw. Hi.
Hi.
Please say hello.
Please.
Hello, little Sea-Monkey.
This is the sound
of my voice.
Hello, son
or daughter. Hello.
Hello.
That is not
the sound of your voice.
That is the voice of a robot.
Our child is gonna be
attached to the toaster.
Or the new VP of marketing.
No. No!
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my gosh!
It's...
It's provisional.
If I wow Cruella de Odile,
then I'll keep the job.
If not, then my head'll be on
a pike next to the last guy.
Well, wow you will!
You wowed me.
But I have two days.
Oh. Yikes.
I know.
What if I don't get them
done in time?
Oh, no, you can't come
to the ultrasound.
Uh...
Unless.,.
Wait, the backup ads we have
did fine in focus groups.
I could retool those.
I'd have to work
around the clock.
Oh, Azrael,
we've come so far,
yet ever am I haunted by
the same familiar riddle.
How to find the Smurfs?
If only I...
I'm sorry, is my
thinking interrupting
your vile hacking?
If only I had
something of theirs.
A drop of spittle.
A fingernail.
Some hair, even.
Then I could make
some Smurf magic.
Very nice.
Are you done now?
I don't want
to look at it.
What?  What?
Is that... No.
No, it can't be.
It is.
The tawny locks
of Smurfette,
Oh, sweet follicular ambrosia!
oh, silky strands of joy.
Mixed with a fair
amount of cat vomit.
Yes. Yes, I am a genius!
With my skills,
even this small trifle
of smurfiness
will yield me just enough
power to catch them all!
Oh, I must find a laboratory
with which to tease the magic
from these precious
little strands.
Oh.
Yes. It's a bit small,
but this should do nicely!
Oh, it's even got
its own cauldron.
What died in here?
Ahhh!
Open. Open. Open.
Open. Open!
Somebody's been working a dark
and terrible magic in there.
Oh!
What is that?
Oh, baby.
Daddy is home.
GUTSY: Come on.
Papa, I'm familiar with
and that moon is
not one of them.
SMURFETTE: Papa?
Stay calm, everyone.
If the portal opened once,
it can open again.
How are we gonna open
a magical portal when
we can't even find Clumsy?
Hey, I think I see
something up there.
Whoa!
Oh.
Whew!
Oh, no.
Oh! Uh... Oh!
Clumsy? Is that you?
Hello.
Help! Help!
Oh, smurf.
Hey.
"Berry Boom."
Mmm.
Ah!
Oh!
Patrick!
Elway. Elway.
I'm sure this is the box.
When I get my hands on him...
Someone's coming!
Shh. Smurfs!
What is it?
No, no!
No, no, no, no. Come on,
come on, come on.
Please, please.
Elway.
Elway. Did you do that?
Come on, put a little
smurf into it.
Hang on, Clumsy.
I got this side.
All together now.
Crikey.
Oh, dear.
Now what, lads?
What happened to Clumsy?
I bet they ate him.
Let's go home.
Hide.
GO! Pull the lid!
Ew!
Gross.
This is so...
That's Clumsy!
Charge, Smurfs! Charge!
Out of the way, big guy.
Clumsy, we're coming!
PAPA: Excuse me. Pardon me.
This is for Clumsy!
BRAINY: Wait for me!
Oh, God!
CLUMSY: Please don't hurt me!
Please, I just
want to go home!
Are you...
Did you just talk?
I'm not saying
till you put down
the giant spiky thing.
SMURFETTE: Clumsy!
GUTSY: Clumsy, where are you?
Make yourself known!
Smurf us a sign!
Come out, Clumsy!
Smurf out, smurf out,
wherever you are.
Are you there?
Come to my voice, laddie!
Where are you?
Can you hear us?
Get out of here!
PAPA: Look out!
Too much aggression!
Go back to the sewers!
Kiss my smurf!
You all find Clumsy!
The giant is mine!
Over here!
SMURFETTE: Get him!
Have you had enough?
Tap out?
Okay, so you're like...
You're blue, and...
Oh! Oh!
Oh, gosh, are you okay?
PAPA: Quickly!
This way!
This way!
Follow me, Smurfs!
Clumsy! Where are you?
Look out!
Other way! Other way!
Run, Smurfs!
Come on!
Run!
Elway!
Smurf for your lives!
GROUCHY: Clumsy,
where the smurf are you?
Spread out!
GUTSY: Stinky breath.
Grace! Run!
Stop bleating like a sheep
and let me hog-tie you,
you wriggly numptie.
Grace, we're being attacked!
Do not be fooled
by their cuteness!
It's okay, it's okay.
They're friendly.
You're lucky
your lassie stepped in.
I was about to make haggis
with your innards.
This is it.
This is it, Azrael!
Smurfette's hair goes in here,
flows through
the Smurf essence extractor,
and finally,
I have my Smurfilator!
Ha! It's the
pièce de résistance.
The crème de la-..
Would you care for
a mint when you're done?
Yes, yes, yes!
With this precious elixir,
my sorcerous spell shall
be powerful beyond
all measurable measurement.
Ah!
This one tiny drop
will give me the power
to capture them all.
Whoa! This is great!
SMURFS:  La Ia Ia Ia Ia Ia
Smurf the whole day long
Next time
you're feeling blue
Just let a smile begin
Happy things
will come to you
So smurf yourself a grin
It's so obvious that what
you're doing is wrong.
Oh, really? After you.
How crazy is this?
There are little blue people
singing in our kitchen!
Oh!
So you're sticking with
your "this is actually
happening" theory?
Sorry.
Okay. It says
here Smurfs are mythical
creatures from Belgium,
also known as Schtroumpfs...
PAPA: Yeah. Mmm-hmm.
Documented by Peyo.
Also says
that they bring good luck.
Like leprechauns to the Irish.
It says
they're mythical, Grace.
I'm so sorry, Master Winslow.
That was great.
GRACE: Well, they look
pretty real to me.
Come on.
GRACE: Aw!
Excuse me.
Okay, to review.
You guys come
from a magic forest where you
live in oversized mushrooms.
Yes.
You're being chased
by an evil wizard.
Yeah.
And you're trapped
in New York
until there's a blue moon...
Very good.
And you like to use
the extremely
imprecise term "smurf"
for just about everything.
Smurfxactly.
And you're all named
after your personalities?
Do you get your names
when you're born,
or after you've exhibited
certain traits?
Yeah.
Yep.
Yeah, whatever.
Master Winslow, there must be
something about the blue moon
on your magic window machine.
Whoa! Just what is this
magic searching device?
Right now,
I'm using Google.
ALL: Ooh!
ALL: Google.
Okay. "Blue moon.
A full moon that occurs
twice in one month.
"A figurative construct..."
Much like yourselves.
Hey!
"But the moon itself
doesn't appear to be blue."
What?
Not blue?
Perfect!
Now we'll never get home!
No cause for alarm,
my little Smurfs.
If we're to open
the portal home,
I'll just have to
smurf us a potion
to invoke the blue moon.
You hear that, honey?
They're only staying till
an actual blue moon rises.
Which could happen if
the little blue Santa man
makes a magic potion,
which, at this point,
seems completely plausible.
Want a bite?
No, thank you.
Of course, the stars will
need to be perfectly aligned.
And when that might be
is hard to determine
without the proper instrument.
Mmm. Master Winslow,
might I borrow
your stargazer?
My what-whatzer?
Uh-oh. He doesn't have
a stargazer. Do you?
This is all my fault.
We're all gonna die.
We're all gonna die!
Smurf out of it,
scaredy-brains!
One Panicky Smurf is enough!
Hey!
Besides, Papa had a vision,
and everything
turns out smurfy.
Right, Papa?
Yes, yes.
It all turns out just fine.
We must find this Smurf thief.
Stop your complaining.
If I were a Smurf,
where would I go?
You there, you there.
Fancy pants.
Have you seen any
little blue men?
Absolutely. What price
are we talking about?
You're selling them?
Have you looked
in the drawer, sweetie?
Wait, what drawer?
In the kitchen, Lilly.
Who is this Lilly?
Are you kidding?
She's the hottest girl
in my department.
Please, please.
Please, young woodsman.
What does the temperature
of this Lilly have to do
with the finding of Smurfs?
Take your meds, man.
What?
Is everyone in this realm
completely insane?
Thank the gods,
a local wizard.
Excellent.
Pardon me, wise sir?
By any chance, have you seen
any little blue men?
They're everywhere!
I knew it. I knew it!
I told you
we were close, AzraeI.
I know.
Now, just take one, everybody.
We have to make sure
our smurfberries last.
Great. We're gonna
be here how long?
Not long. First,
we have to get a stargazer.
Next, find a book of spells
and then smurf a portal
and we're home.
Very simple,
my little Smurfs.
Bye, Elway.
Someone looks smurfalish!
Why you wearing a leash?
It's a tie.
Does it keep your neck warm?
No.
Clearly, it functions
as an aid in his craft,
like a blacksmith's apron.
I wear it because it's what
everyone wears at work.
What are you,
you pasty giant?
I try to get people
to buy things by analyzing
market trend predictions.
Predictions! A-ha!
He's a fortune teller.
Look, I would love
to explain but I am
super late. I gotta go.
I really don't have
time for this.
What?
You had one outfit on,
and now
you're wearing something
completely different.
Yeah. It...
Now, Smurfette,
she probably got
the other one dirty.
Let's not embarrass her.
Sorry.
Thanks for letting us stay
in your mushroom, Miss Grace.
It's really nice.
Aw! Well, thank you.
I'm glad you like it.
I like our little
mushroom, too.
But you know, somebody
wants a bigger mushroom.
But, then you'd be
further apart.
You said it, sister.
Okay, I've gotta go.
I've got an appointment.
I've got a baby
on the way, so...
Wait, wait. We can't just
leave them here alone,
without an adult.
I'm 546 years old.
Of course you are.
They'll be fine.
They'll be fine.
All right.
Love you.
Okay.
Bye. Bye.
SMURFETTE:
Bye, Grace! Goodbye.
By the way, I wouldn't go
anywhere if I were you.
Why not?
Our world doesn't do well
with visitors from other
places.
I mean, look what
happened to E.T.
It's a movie.
A moving picture.
Book. Just stay, okay?
Great. He's gone
and we still don't
have a stargazer.
Wait a smurf.
If he's a fortune teller,
he reads stars all the time.
Ergo, it's at his
place of business.
Excellent work, Brainy.
What are we waiting for?
Let's ride.
CLUMSY: Yeah, come on, guys.
Hey, stop it.
Come on, Smurfs!
Let's go get that stargazer.
Whoo-hoo!
GUTSY: Surprise, surprise.
GROUCHY: Oh, no.
Clumsy, I think
it might be best
if you stay here.
You know?
Smurf an eye
on the mushroom.
Oh.
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.
This way, Smurfs!
Let's follow Mr. Winslow.
Well, I can smurf an eye
on the mushroom.
Smurf away!
Whoo! Let's smurf this joint.
BRAINY: Is he down there?
Taxi!
Can you see him?
GUTSY: Look, he's getting
into the mechanical wagon.
Oh, no.
Clearly that distance
is too great...
Off you go!
No! Gutsy!
Come on, Smurfs!
Smurfabunga!
Goodbye, blue world.
Use your hat, you ninny!
GROUCHY: Couldn't we just
have taken the stairs?
There we go.
Not funny, Gutsy.
Oh!
It was a little funny.
PAPA: Shh! Smurfs.
PAPA: We're stopping.
Hold on tight.
SMURFETTE: Not to me, Grouchy.
Oh, did I do that? Sorry.
Keep the change.
Thanks, man.
Master Winslow,
we really need your help.
Yoo-hoo! Hey.
Right here.
What are you doing here?
What part of "we need
a stargazer" don't you
understand, you numptie?
You can't be out in public.
Who are you talking to?
If we could just have
a quick look around
in your predicting parlor...
We really wanna go home.
DRIVER: Come on, man,
I gotta go.
Fine. Just come here,
come here.
SMURFETTE: Please, please.
All of you. Trust me.
GUTSY: Careful. Hey,
watch the smurfberries.
I'm not going... Hey!
Be quiet.
BRAINY: It's dark in here.
GROUCHY: All right,
who smurfed?
GUTSY: Hey! Get your hand
out of my kilt.
BRAINY: Um,
that's not my hand.
PATRICK: Hey, ticklish.
Morning. Morning.
RECEPTIONIST: Good morning,
Mr. Winslow.
Congratulations on
your promotion.
Thank you.
I hope you guys
like desk drawers,
because that's where...
You're late.
Odile!
You were in my office.
It's my building,
and we have much work to do.
The launch for Jouvenel
is tomorrow night.
Is your concept ready?
Close. I had
a crazy morning.
What are you doing?
Nothing. I'm excited.
I'm excited about
all the concept ideas.
And hungry. Sorry.
Hungry for its success.
Nervous energy.
Nervous energy's what's
going on up in here.
I like it.
Yep.
The fear of failure is
a fabulous motivator.
True that.
SMURFETTE: Hey! Stop it.
Henri.
Make it work.
You have no idea.
SMURFETTE: What is this?
GUTSY: Why did I
get the armpit?
Stop pushing me.
GROUCHY: Go easy on
the cologne tomorrow.
Are you crazy?
You're gonna get me fired.
My hair!
GUTSY: I couldn't even
breathe in there.
It smelled like the business
end of a sheep.
BRAINY:
I don't see a stargazer.
How you doing?
PAPA: I'm sorry,
Master Winslow, but we badly
need to borrow your stargazer.
I don't have
a stargazer, okay?
It's not something people
of this century just have,
especially here.
Not happy.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to work.
Well, perhaps we could sing
to help things along.
And then
we'll get the stargazer.
Come along, Smurfs.
SMURFS:  La la la la la Ia
Sing a happy song
La Ia Ia la la Ia
Smurf the whole day long
Stop.
La la la la la la
Stop!
GROUCHY:
Sing a happy song
Come on. None of you
find that song just
the tiniest bit annoying?
I find it annoying.
Well, what do you
sing at work?
I don't sing at work.
What?
And you have
to wear a leash.
Harsh.
I know.
How about if we hum?
Please stop humming.
I need to hone
my message here.
I've got a message.
"Always chew
with your mouth closed."
Papa taught us that.
That's good.
You should use that.
Or, "Dance and be happy."
How about, "Grab life
by the grapes"?
BRAINY: "Turn that
frown upside down."
GUTSY: "Always bet on blue."
"Have a smurfy day."
"l kissed a Smurf
and I liked it"?
PAPA: It's an embarrassment
of riches.
They're giving you gold here.
Thank you.
Master Winslow,
you'll know
it's the right message
if it comes from the heart.
Right, Smurfs?
Yeah.
You said it.
Absolutely.
SMURFETTE: Of course.
Welcome to my world.
I love emerging dramatically
through the smoke.
It makes... It makes me feel
so deliciously mysterious.
Also, it gives the skin
a wonderful glow.
What?
Where? Where?
What?
Oh, curses! So close.
What?
Oh.
Oh. Oh, theirs is upside-down.
Idiots, They painted it wrong.
Come, Azrael.
Hi.
Hello.
What are you doing?
Just greening
things up a bit.
That's so sweet.
That's very sweet but,
you know, I'm not
so sure this stuff's
gonna grow out here.
We'll see. Smurfs have
a very blue thumb.
So where is everybody else?
They went to get a stargazer
so Papa can smurf a blue moon
to get us home.
And they went without you?
Yeah. I mean,
who knows why?
Whoa! Whoa!
MAN: Hey!
Sorry!
Why don't we come inside?
Smurfs, where are you?
ODILE: Make sure
to demonstrate that
this new anti-aging
cream can make
any woman look beautiful,
young, vibrant.
it's almost magical.
HENRI: Astonishing, many.
I see no transformation.
Your potion has no power.
Excuse me?
Well, she's still
an eye-offending
dogfish, if you ask me.
Sir!
This is my mother
who you're speaking of.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't realize.
How sad for you
in 30 years.
Henri, escort
this lunatic out.
"Lunatic"?
Security!
I am the great and
powerful Gargamel!
"Lunatic." Could
a lunatic do this?
Alakazootiful!
How did you do that?
Yes, and seriously,
me next,
So sorry, but lunatics
and great wizards
never reveal their secrets.
Come, Azrael! Now,
where are my Smurfs?
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't go.
I need to know
what you just did.
Not telling.
Please, señor.
Can you do that again?
You may attempt
to persuade me.
What is it that you desire?
Riches?
Fame?
Fortune?
With my help,
the whole world
will know the name
that is Garbagesmell.
Gargamel.
Yes. With my help,
the whole world will know
the genius
that is Gargamel.
I'm...
I'm sorry. Did you
just say "genius"?
So, even though
I'm what you might
call accident-prone,
on the bright side,
I did land us all here
in your little mushroom,
and we got to meet
you and Patrick.
You're so sweet.
And I know how you feel.
I'm so clumsy, too.
Well, I used to be.
Really?
Yeah.
So how long
did it take you to...
Oh! Gosh.
...un-fumble your feet?
Well, about as long
as it takes to realize that
nobody's just one thing.
You can be anything
you wanna be.
"Hero Smurf."
Yeah.
Probably not.
Hey, Brainy,
help me figure this out.
Let me show you.
First, you put your...
Oh! Ouch!
GROUCHY: Works every time.
La Ia Ia Ia Ia Ia
Sing a happy song
This is a fascinating
wind machine
you have here.
Oh.
Hi, Patrick.
Grace, help. Help!
They are everywhere
and they won't stop singing.
I cannot get a thing done.
Please come and get these
guys.
ODILE: Señor Gargamel,
I'll be frank.
Clinique, LancÃ´me, MAC.
They will kill to get what
you have in that ring.
Not if we kill them first.
Let's see, we're going to
need some knights,
preferably in shining armor,
some bowmen, poison arrows.
I like the way you think.
And some spikes
to mount their heads on.
Well, it is all about
the presentation.
And, of course,
all of our testing would
be animal cruelty-free?
What, they pay extra
for the animal cruelty?
Is that it?
Get out of here.
You have a wicked
sense of humor.
We like that, don't we?
Hey, out of here!
Henri?
I said, get out of here.
Señor Gargamel, now you
must assure me, darling,
that you can recreate
whatever it was
that you did to my mother,
but on a massive scale.
Do that, and the world
will worship you.
Did you hear that, Azrael?
Yeah.
"Worship" Oh, it rolls off
the tongue like flesh
from a... Not pilgrim...
Heretic. Yes, thank you.
Oh, thank the gods,
a chamber pot.
This swill that you call
Dom Pérignon has gone
straight to my nether regions.
Here, toss this out
the window, yeah?
Today, please.
Now, to the matter at hand.
So do we have a deal, señor?
Not quite, my sweet maiden.
You see, first I must
have my Smurfs.
GRACE: You guys just have
to understand that
Patrick's under a lot
of pressure right now.
So if you could just
lay low for a little bit...
You have my word
of honor, Miss Grace.
My Smurfs will not
move from this bag.
Okay, good.
Stargazer!
What?
Stargazer! Let's go!
GROUCHY: Everybody out!
Come on!
No,no,no!
Guys, let's go!
No,no,no,no,no!
Full smurf ahead.
GRACE: No, wait, wait!
Hit the deck!
Hey, I'm walking here!
I'm walking!
Save me!
Hey, look out, Brainy.
Can't everyone
just slow down
and enjoy life?
Get off me. Get off!
Wait for it.
GUTSY: I gotta get me
one of those.
Oh, my gosh!
DRIVER: Hey, lady! Hey!
Wait, wait. Hold on!
PAPA: When we get inside,
spread out and
find that stargazer.
GUTSY: Come on, Smurfs!
Mmm-hmm.
Hey.
Patrick, the Smurfs
have gone AWOL.
Grace, are you running?
No, no, I'm totally fine,
but they need your help!
Patrick, I'm afraid
they're gonna get
themselves killed!
Sweetie, they're fine.
They can send us
a tiny thank-you note
when they get back
to shroom town. Right
after they invent paper.
Patrick, they need you.
Honey,..
Patrick, I need you.
Oh, my gosh,
please hurry!
All right. Where are you?
The man is a lunatic.
It's not going to work.
I don't know,
he needs Smoops.
"Smurfs."
Smarps.
No, no, "Smurfs"
"Smurfs" with an...
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
GARGAMEL: You call that
groveling, you fool?
Every village has
an idiot. What?
You're right. That's him!
Stop! Stop! Smurf thief!
Smurf thief!
GIRL: Come on, guys,
the dolls are here!
Stargazer, stargazer,
stargazer.
Stargazer, stargazer,
stargazer, stargazer...
Ah, so that's where
all the unicorns went.
I'm not afraid to
go off on my own,
I thought you might
like the company.
Fine. Then hang on.
Whoa!
A Smurf cannon!
Ah, the only way to fly.
Perfect.
Time to catch some air!
Smurfabunga!
That'll put some
air up your skirt!
Gotta be a stargazer
up here somewhere.
Ahhh! Predator!
Ah, Smurf droppings.
These are disgustingly tasty.
Whoa! Hello.
SMURFETTE: Oh, creepy.
I hope they weren't looking
for a stargazer, too.
Stargazers, stargazers...
Dresses!
You mean l can have
more than one kind of dress?
What?
Papa, I'm telling you,
we're never gonna
find those...
Shh. Stargazers.
They're dangerously high.
You're right.
We're gonna need
something tall.
Don't you think
someone will notice us?
Just act natural.
I'm a bear.
Brainy!
I'm coming. I'm coming,
I'm coming, guys.
Hold still, stairs!
GIRL: Whoa! Look at
the stair-climbing toy!
Hey.
What is that?
Let me see it.
Whoa! Careful.
I want one, too, Mommy!
Let me see.
I'm just tired of
the whole dating game.
Just say who you are
and be who you say, right?
SALESMAN: I can't
seem to get it to scan.
WOMAN:
My son wants one of those
blue animatronic things.
Can you help me out here?
Do they come in pink?
My daughter wants pink.
I'm sorry.
What aisle did
you find this on?
I'll take the floor model.
I was here first.
There's a line.
Can I interest you in
a Coldy Holdy Ice Bat?
What? Ice Bat?
It comes in pink.
Smurf thief! Stop!
Hey, hey
He's getting closer, fool
Yo, hey, hey
We're doing what we do
We've got to
get them moving
Do I use my grouchiness
as a wall because
I'm afraid to be vulnerable?
You bet.
Smurf!
But I've got feelings.
No. No, I can't
be out already!
What was I thinking?
Wasting my only drop
of Smurf essence
on that old hag?
It's a big problem, sir.
We don't seem to
have it in stock.
Hey! Keep your smurfs
to yourselves!
Don't you people
have any boundaries?
MAN: Grab it!
I'm not a toy!
Where is she?
Where'd she go?
There she is!
There she is!
Hey, this dress is mine!
Smurfette!
Wait, I'm shopping.
Let's shop later.
GIRL: Go! Come on!
CLUMSY: Patrick!
Patrick, help!
Clumsy, come here!
A giant's after me!
She's huge!
Hey, that's mine!
Sorry, little girl,
this one's not for...
Mommy!
Really?
Don't ever forget that
one magical moment
our two worlds met.
And I wasn't grouchy,
I wasn't.
Can you just say one thing,
please? I'm dying here.
Hey!
That's one!
Technically,
when loading cargo
onto the head of a bear,
one should distribute
the weight...
Brainy, just pull.
Ahoy, mateys!
What are ya waiting for?
We're drawin' a crowd.
Show-off.
Oh, dear.
They think we're toys.
Hold onto your knickers, boys,
it's about to get grisly.
Don't let me fall!
Just hang onto that
stargazer, you two!
GUTSY: Hey! Come on, Smurfs!
They're getting away!
Let's go, go, go!
I'll have you at ramming
speed in no time.
Hold on!
I think we lost them.
Ow! Again with the head.
Oh, dear.
Out of the way
or I'll caber toss ya!
Where did you
learn how to drive?
You think you can do better?
Yes, I do believe
I can do better.
Ha!
Two more!
Brainy! Gutsy!
GARGAMEL: Papa!
SMURFETTE: Grace,
that's Gargamel!
Oh, you again!
Get your paws off me!
No, no, no, no.
Ha!
Bad kitty!
Oh, I hate that cat!
Gargamel.
Ah! Smurfette.
More lovely than ever.
Oh, Gargamel, I guess
you've outsmarted us again.
Or not!
Azrael. Azrael,
what are you doing?
Get out of my suckamajig!
Get out!
Let me help you with that.
Oh, thank you, kind...
You! You...
Ahhh!
Yahoo!
Patrick.
Hey.
Impressive.
Thanks.
I'll get the stargazer.
I'll get the Smurfs.
That's him!
He took it right off my back!
Leaf-blower thief!
Please stand up, sir.
You're going downtown.
Do not resist.
Do not resist!
Unhand me. Unhand me,
you heathens!
Or suffer the wrath
of the great and powerful...
Let me...
Let me see here...
Hmm.
GRACE: How can you be
the only girl
in the village?
Well, see, I wasn't brought
by a stork like the others.
I was created by Gargamel
to trap the other Smurfs.
Wow. And then what happened?
Papa saved me.
He cast a special spell
and then helped me become
the Smurf I was meant to be.
No. Play it safe.
"Odile, pending your approval,
"it's ready to go
to the billboard agency."
Well, here goes nothing.
Papa should be done by now.
Yeah. Enough
with the suspense.
I wanna go home.
Me, too.
Now that that wily
wizard's got our scent,
it's a whole new wager.
Without that blue moon,
our giblets are gravy.
PATRICK: Well, it's off.
Time to either celebrate
or file for unemployment.
Hey, what's wrong?
I'm sure we'll be fine.
Oh. It's okay.
That one's hypersmurfilating.
Yeah, tell me about it.
It's all this waitin'
that's killin' us.
Yeah.
I know the feeling.
Better yet...
I know the cure.
You just match the colors
with the buttons.
Seesaw swingin'
with the boys in the school
And your feet
flyin' up in the air
Singin',
"Hey, diddle, diddle"
With your kitty
in the middle of the swing
Like you just don't care
You try.
Hey! Go, Grouchy!
BRAINY: You're good!
Nice one!
GROUCHY:
Hey, look at me, guys!
I'm shredding!
Walk this way...
You sing.
Talk this way
Just give me a kiss
It's a rock face.
It's Gene Simmons. He's a...
Huh?
Never mind.
Like this
Like this
Smurfette sweetie
is a classy kind of sassy
Little skirts climbing
way up her knee
Not another single girl
in the whole smurfin' world
And I can't believe
she's lookin' at me
It's a complete
Surrender
To the power of her
Gender
So I close my eyes
and make a wish
I just want to
Savor
All her smurfberry
Flavor
So I smurfed her
just a little kiss
Like this
GUTSY: Check out Clumsy.
PATRICK: Whoa, Clumsy.
You found your niche.
Yeah!
GROUCHY: Clumsy,
holdin' it down.
Look at him go!
Come on, Gutsy!
Here we go!
Yay, Gutsy! Get down
with your bad smurf!
BRAINY: Go, Gutsy!
That's right.
Careful.
Get your smurf on!
Gutsy!
Nice!
Yeah!
GUTSY: Thank you.
That was rare.
La la la la la la
la la la la la
La la la la la Ia
la la Ia la la...
Oh.
Hey, guys. How do you
like my new dress?
Whoa! Is there
a draught in here?
Oh, okay, that's not
what l had in mind.
Oh.
Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?
Sorry, boys.
Ahhh!
Whoa!
Yeah, that cools
the giblets.
Nothin' like a cool breeze
through my Enchanted Forest.
A-ha!
It's approved.
GRACE: What?
She approved it.
She approved the ad!
She loved it?
Well, she said "approved,"
so coming from her,
that's love.
Oh, my goodness!
Patrick, yeah!
BRAINY: You owned it!
GRACE: Oh, my goodness!
Yay, Patrick!
BRAINY: Yeah.
PATRICK: No jumping,
no jumping, no jumping.
No jumping, no jumping. Okay.
PATRICK: Should I send it?
I'm not going to.
GRACE: Yes! Do it!
Do it this minute.
I will do it. All right.
Do it, do it.
Go, go, go!
Tomorrow this'll be
on every billboard
in New York City.
GUTSY: It's a go, laddie boy!
Well done, Master Winslow.
Oh! Hey, guys, Papa's back.
Papa, are your
calculations done?
Yeah!
I'm nearly out
of smurfberries.
It's proving more
difficult than I'd hoped.
But we are going
home, right?
Of course.
Just not tonight.
Now, off to bed.
BRAINY: I was hoping
I'd be sleeping
in my mushroom tonight.
SMURFETTE:
I miss the other Smurfs.
Me, too.
I've never spent
the night away
from home before.
Well, there was last night.
But who could sleep?
Hush. Hush now, Smurfs.
Everything's going
to be just fine.
Papa?
Do you really believe
we're ever gonna get
home to the other Smurfs?
Don't worry.
We'll be reunited
with the others
soon enough.
If only the stars
would align.
You know who I miss?
Chef Smurf. Hefty Smurf.
Hey, Jokey Smurf.
Greedy. Narrator.
Painter. Baker.
Harmony.
Oh, I miss
Complimentary Smurf.
He always has such
nice things to say.
I'll tell you
who I don't miss,
Passive-Aggressive Smurf.
Aye.
Yeah.
He's always so nice,
but when he leaves
you feel bad.
Ah, another wretched
Smurfless night.
Oh, hello, little moth.
Perhaps with your help
I'll find a way to get
them back.
Oh, you and I are
kindred spirits, little one.
Both of us meant to soar.
Go now, and bring back an army
of mighty eagles to free me.
Fly, tiny eagle. Fly and
bring back your brethren.
Fly! Fly!
Fly!
Okay. Let's see here.
Hey.
I'm guessing you have
a long night ahead of you.
You guys drink coffee?
Is a Smurf's butt blue?
So tell me, that weird guy
in the ratty bathrobe
at the toy store?
Gargamel?
He's not really
a wizard, is he?
Not the smartest of sorcerers,
but dangerous just the same.
Thank you.
Back home, I could
hold him at bay
with a spell or two.
But here, without
my books and potions...
Well, today we got lucky.
But next time, who knows?
Well, what are
you gonna do?
I'll do anything and
everything I can do
to get my Smurfs home.
I won't ever give up.
They're my family.
And you never
give up on family.
Doesn't it freak you
out sometimes
having all those little guys
depending on you?
I mean, what if
you screw up?
How'd you know
when you were ready?
Here. Come sit
on Papa's lap.
Hmm? Uh.,.
Yeah, right. Scratch that.
Probably not the best idea.
Yeah, yeah.
Let me ask you something.
Why did you come for us today
when your Grace called?
She needed me.
I could hear it
in her voice.
Uh-huh.
Well, that's what
being a papa is.
When it comes time,
you just do.
And knowing what to do
doesn't come from up here.
Mmm-mmm.
It comes from here,
where it matters most.
My spleen?
No, your heart.
I'm trying to have
a moment here,
you whippersnapper.
You're a good papa, Papa.
And you'll be
a good one, too.
INMATE:
Come on, what you doing, man?
Get that weight off there.
Come on, baby, stop playing.
GARGANIEL:
Come on, you silly moth.
Where are my eagles?
You know what happens to
people who sit on my bench?
Uh-uh-uh. Be gone
with you, behemoth,
for I have instructed
a moth to summon forth
a gaggle of noble eagles
to free me
from this confine.
Get up, Grandpa!
Hey.
Ha! Ha!
You see?
You see?
The dungeon isn't built
that can hold
the likes of Gargamel.
Behold my glorious
army of... Flies?
Flies? I said
"to fly." "Fly."
What is this?
Not "flies,"
you light-loving moron.
All right, up, up, up,
bother it all.
Up! Up, you inglorious devils!
So long, scallywags!
INMATES: Ooh!
Well, don't do it again.
Go around it, go around!
INMATE: Oh, that's nasty.
Go around it.
Stupid flies.
Wait, take me with you!
Wait! Wait! Ow!
Ow!
To my castle for more essence!
Shh! Here they come,
here they come.
PATRICK: Whoa!
Pretty smurfy,
if I do say so myself.
Yeah.
Come on, Elway,
right over here.
Good boy.
Thank you very much.
GRACE: Oh, my goodness.
Here we go.
There we are.
Clumsy.
Blue thumbs.
This is unbelievable.
I think there's
too much pink.
Just because your name
is Grouchy
doesn't mean
you always have to be grouchy.
Yeah, it does.
Smurfette.
Hi.
High five. High four.
High four.
Great news!
The stars have revealed
a perfect time to smurf
the blue moon.
We're going home! Yay!
GUTSY: I knew
you'd do it, Papa!
GROUCHY: All right!
Smurftastic!
I never doubted it
for a second.
It has to be done tonight,
between first star
and high moon.
That's our only chance.
But we'll need a magic spell
that works in this realm
to open the portal home.
Master Winslow,
a question, please.
Yeah, shoot.
Is there a place
that sells spells?
Mmm... No.
Is there a place
that proffers potions?
Yeah, no.
How about old books?
Wait, there's an antique book
shop right near where I work.
Yes. Dr. Wong's. Yeah.
Dr. Wong's something.
Perfect. That'll do.
Oh, hear that, boys?
We're almost home.
Yeah!
I love being almost home.
Hey! Smurf hug!
Oh, I love you guys!
Bring it in, big fella.
I wouldn't...
GUTSY: Come on,
we know you want to.
Yes.
SMURFETTE: Yeah,
come on, Patrick.
If I can do it,
you can do it.
Go on, big fella.
Here he comes!
Smurf hug!
GUTSY: We're goin' home!
Hey there.
Oh. Oh!
Hey, get up here.
That's it, laddie.
Nice one.
What's that?
Yeah. All of ya.
All of ya!
Oh, look!
We don't have to
make a blue moon.
We've already got one.
GROUCHY: Really?
GUTSY: What?
Look, guys,
right over there.
No, it isn't.
CLUMSY: It is.
Smurfette's right.
Look at the blue moon.
That's the wrong ad.
What happened
to my office?
We fixed it for the baby.
Another smurf hug!
No. No, no, no.
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.
Someone sent this to
the ad agency last night.
Who messed with
my computer?
I dunno.
None of my Smurfs would...
Wasn't me.
Uh-oh.
I mighta, sorta, tripped.
Yeah, well, you mighta,
sorta, just got me fired.
You sent the wrong file.
Patrick, it was
just an accident.
What am I supposed
to do, Grace?
You said that they would
bring good luck.
This is anything but good.
I never should've
let this happen.
I should've said no.
I never wanted a house
full of little people
running around!
Blue. Little blue...
Okay... Whoa!
Patrick.
What are you doing?
Going to try
to save my job.
We never intended
to be a burden,
Master Winslow.
I'm smurfilly sorry
about what I...
Stop saying "smurf"
for everything.
What does that
even mean? Smurf!
Smurfitty-smurf-smurf-Smurf!
There's no call
for that kind of
language, laddie.
See?
Okay, Patrick, wait
Hey, hey!
Will you...
Wait, Patrick.
Maybe I can try to fix it.
Just stop and listen to me
for a second, please.
What?
Look, I'm really sorry
about your job, okay?
And I hope that you can
straighten that out.
But you are so not seeing
the big picture here.
I mean, look around.
Look what's happening
right now.
Of all the people
on the planet,
those magical little
creatures came to us.
They chose us.
Don't you see
how absolutely
amazing that is?
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
thing, Patrick.
This is our blue moon.
And if you don't stop for
just a second to see that,
you're gonna miss it.
Hey, hey. Taxi!
Come on! Come on!
Blast. Blast you!
There's got to be some
essence in here somewhere!
Not now.
What? What?
Very, very well done,
my little friend.
And to think, I almost
ate you that time.
Come, Azrael.
We must find this Patrick,
the rouge merchant.
He will lead us to our
elusive little blue quarry.
Don't you just have
a switch or something
to shut them off?
Tomorrow?
Are you kidding me?
Ron, Ron. If I don't get
those ads down now,
I don't have a job tomorrow.
Smurf me.
PAPA: Which way to
the bookstore, Brainy?
BRAINY: According to
the searching device,
we take the F machine
two dots past
the red circle to Chinaland.
GUTSY: Look out, Brainy.
GROUCHY:
"Chinatown," birdbrain.
BRAINY: Smurftito, smurftato.
PAPA: Here it is.
GUTSY: Come on, everybody.
GROUCHY: Let's go, let's go.
GUTSY: Mind the gap.
Wait? Are we
sure about this?
What?
GUTSY: Jump!
SMURFETTE: Oh, my.
Not happy.
Psst! Come on, Brainy.
Let's poke around
this great steel carriage.
Is it safe?
Of course it is.
That was great.
Ouch!
GROUCHY: I hope
we find this place soon.
I can't see out of this... Ow!
Oh, for smurf's sake.
GUTSY: I thought that's why
we left Clumsy behind.
SMURFETTE: Oh, it smells
like butter in here.
BRAINY: Where do you suppose
this magic bookstore could be?
GUTSY: Wait a minute.
SMURFETTE:
There it is.
BRAINY: It's Closed.
GROUCHY: Figures.
PAPA: We have to find
a way in. Come on.
PAPA: I'm gettin'
too old for this.
Brainy.
Gutsy.
All right, everybody.
GROUCHY: Hey.
SMURFETTE: Wow.
BRAINY: This place
looks creepy to me.
It's not creepy,
it's different.
And I like it.
Let's just get the book
and get outta here.
PAPA: You're right.
This book of spells
is our ticket home,
I am but a simple wizard
with a simple desire,
limitless power
and world adulation.
Now why does it
have to be so hard?
MAN:  La la la la la la
la la la la la
La la la la la Ia
la Ia Ia la la
Pardon me. Please, wise sir.
Wise sir. Please, please.
Wherever did you hear
that ear-damning squall?
It's your little blue men.
I saw them going
into the bookstore
around the corner.
La la la la la Ia
la la...
You know, that song
is really annoying.
Cautiously excited.
La la la la la...
That's not it. That's not it.
Hey! Oh, no, that's not it.
Look at all these
amazing books.
It's gotta be
in here somewhere.
No, this isn't it.
You see anything,
Smurfette?
Nothin' up here, guys.
Look out below! Oh!
I've got somethin', lads.
Great job, Gutsy.
GUTSY: Oh. Nearly there.
BRAINY: Well done.
Just a minute.
That's it. There we go.
Ah, yes.
"L'Histoire des Schtroumpfs."
Hmm. Peyo.
That's us.
Yes, this is the one.
Whoa!
Look at that.
Wow.
Well, I'll be smurfed.
The secret runes are
hidden in the drawing.
You see all that in there?
Look here,
at the patterns
on this page.
Openous-lockicuss.
What?
You're right, Azrael.
This does have "me"
written all over it.
Oh, that's just
plain naughty.
All that remains now is
to return to the waterfall
and invoke
this spell, tonight.
And we can go home?
And we can go home.
Oh, you're going
home, all right.
No.
To a little place
I like to call
BellVeedaRay Castle,
where your essence
shall finally be mine.
The dragon wand.
No!
It's...
Oh, please,
please, allow me.
It's Gargamel!
Run, Smurfs!
GUTSY: Come on, Smurfs!
GROUCHY: Go, go, go!
Wait for me!
GROUCHY: To the door!
Smurfentine! Smurfentine!
BRAINY: Hurry!
Yes, yes, do resist,
little Smurfs.
After all,
what is the hunt
without the thrill!
BRAINY: No!
We gotta go! Move!
Run!
GUTSY: Get goin', Smurfs!
GROUCHY: Faster, faster.
GUTSY: Let's get outta here.
Brainy, take the spell,
brew the potion and
smurf the moon tonight.
It has to be tonight.
Me? Smurf the moon?
No, no, I'm not ready.
You have to be.
Go. And no matter
what happens...
Papa?
...do not come
back for me.
BRAINY: What?
Papa, no!
BRAINY: No!
GROUCHY: Papa!
What are you waiting for,
Gargamel?
Come to papa, Papa!
Just go!
Papa!
GROUCHY: Papa!
No!
Keep movin', lass.
Do as Papa said.
Papa!
Is that all that
you've got, Gargamel?
What's gonna happen to Papa?
Papa told us
to smurf the moon,
and that's exactly
what we're gonna do.
Come on. We don't
have much time.
"Come on"? Come on, where?
How are we gonna
get back to Clumsy?
We ride. Come on!
Be still, bird.
I don't think
they're friendly.
Well, neither am I.
But they carry disease.
And Smurfs. Let's ride.
Whoa, bird, whoa!
Come on!
But I'm not sure
l can do this.
SMURFETTE: You can do it,
Brainy. Hold on!
According
to my calculations,
this is dangerous!
It's getting dark.
Yeah. Yeah, I think
we'd better go look for them.
Yeah.
Hi.
Where are the others?
We think they're still
at the bookstore.
Listen, Grace, I'm...
Hey, Odile.
Patrick...
Listen, listen.
Before you fire me,
l know that the ads that ran
weren't the ads l sent.
But they're the ads
I should have sent.
The ads I almost did send.
But I didn't 'cause...
I second-guessed myself.
I gave you what
I thought you wanted,
instead of what
I thought was right.
But this is right.
It means something to me
and... I don't know,
I think it's gonna mean
something to others, too.
It's not just a moon,
Odile, it's a blue moon.
"Once in a blue moon."
That means that
there are only a few
moments in your life
when something
truly memorable,
truly magical,
happens to you.
And, if you hesitate,
if you're afraid,
you might just miss it.
That's what
that image means.
Don't let those
blue moon moments
pass you by.
I will call you back to
tell you if you're fired.
I so smurfin' love you.
GROUCHY: Left-left, right!
Right-right, bird!
BRAINY: Brace for impact!
The window's open,
ya ninny.
Whoa! We're outta control!
Whoa, bird!
Watch out for the... Ouch!
That'll do, pigeon.
Thank you, bird.
Look! We got the incantation.
Where's Papa?
Gargamel's got him.
What?
Oh, no.
He took him to some place
called BellVeedaRay Castle.
He's gonna...
Don't say it.
BellVeedaRay.
What is BellVeedaRay?
Belve... He's taken him
to Belvedere Castle
in Central Park.
To extract his essence.
What? Well, we have
to go get him.
Yeah.
No! Gargamel's more
powerful than ever.
Papa said no matter
what happens we're not
to go back for him.
He's trying to protect us.
No! We can't leave
Papa behind.
It was a Smurf promise.
No, no, no. We can't.
We promised Papa
we'd do exactly what he said.
That's right.
l didn't.
I never promised
him anything.
Neither did I.
And there is no way
I'm leaving here
without Papa.
Patrick, wait.
I'm coming with you.
I'm in.
Aye. Me, too.
No Smurf left behind!
Not Papa, and not you.
All for one and
one for Smurf!
SMURFS: All for one
and one for Smurf!
La la la la la la
I'll squeeze a few
And tweeze a few
And steal
their essence blue
Very impressive, my dear,
sweet little Papa!
Oh, look at this.
Just a tiny little bit of
your little tiny beard yields
me all of this essence.
Just imagine what
I'll be able to harvest
from your entire
family of Smurfs.
Alakazookas!
Behold my glorious
Smurf magic machine!
No. No! The cages! No! No!
GARGAMEL:
I'll steam the essence
from their sweat.
I'll tug it
from their tears!
I'll snip it
from their hair.
You're a fool, Gargamel.
My Smurfs are well
on their way home by now.
Back in black
I hit the sack
I've been too long
I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose
from the noose
That's kept me
hanging about
I keep looking at the sky
'cause it's gettin' me high
Forget the hearse
'cause I'll never die
Oh, yeah.
Let's light this candle.
Whoa! Whoa!
Good luck, Gutsy!
Into the breach!
I'll see you there!
We all remember
the plan, right?
Let's get our smurf on.
Brainy, what's happening?
I've added the ingredients.
It's more powerful
than anticipated.
I don't think I can do it.
Okay, Brainy, you can do this.
Just say the incantation.
Whoa!
I'll be smurfed!
I did it. I did it,
Papa! I did it!
I don't believe it!
Wow.
It's the Anjelou moon.
MAN 1: How did she do that?
MAN 2: It's beautiful.
MAN 3: Oh, Odile.
WOMAN 1: Oh, wow.
WOMAN 2: That's wonderful.
Now, I don't want you
to worry, Papa.
That which doesn't kill you
only makes me stronger.
GROUCHY: Yo!
Oh. Huh?
Gargamel!
Come out and play!
Oh, I think
our tiny little guests
have finally arrived.
No!
Ah, well.
Enjoy the ride, Papa!
And remember,
keep your hands and feet
inside the cart
at all times.
No. No! No!
Smurfs, run!
Smurfs.
You have our Papa.
Prepare to get smurfed!
Yeah, what he said.
GARGAMEL: Adorable.
Two little smurfs
come to save
their beloved Papa.
BRAINY: Hey, Gargamel.
Make that three little smurfs.
And I went home
and got a few friends.
My, my, my!
I think the whole village
must be here.
Whatever will I do
with all this essence?
On me, boys.
SMURF 1: Fire!
SMURF 2: Let's get
this hoedown started!
NARRATOR:
There comes a time when
every Smurf must stand up...
Watch it,
you little hoodlums!
...for what is good
and cute and blue
in the world.
And on this brisk
New York night,
that time is now.
Hey! Seriously?
Sorry, it's kind
of what I do.
JOKEY: Eat yolk, Gargamel!
Patrick, can you do it?
Go, go, go!
Hurry, they can't
hold out for long.
You know, one bad apple
can ruin your whole day.
Full smurf ahead!
Come on!
Hey, Gargamel,
here's a little souvenir
from the Big Apple.
Out of the frying pan...
And into the...
Fire.
Fire.
I'm too beautiful to die!
Oh, Papa.
No. No, Smurfette.
What did he do to you?
You shouldn't have
come back for me.
Papa, I'm getting you
out of here right now.
PAPA: Smurfette!
Hang on, Papa,
I'll be back.
Charge!
JOKEY: Get him!
BRAINY: Grab the wand!
FARMER: Goin' in!
HANDY: Go!
Huh?
Bombs away!
I'm going for a strike!
Alakazam!
Crikey.
FARMER: Look out, Gutsy!
Oh, ya blinkin' flip!
Hang on, Papa.
Onions!
Get back, cat.
Here, kitty, kitty...
Smurfette!
Looking for me?
Play time is over!
Behold the awesome
power of me!
Smurfette?
Had enough, huh?
You're mine, kitty.
I'm done smurfing around.
Hmm?
You smurfed with
the wrong girl.
I got you, Greedy.
Oh, my cupcake!
What's happening, Papa?
No!
Gargamel!
Not so fast,
goody blue-shoes.
Oh, Papa!
Now, it's time to break
their little blue wills.
No.
Are you watching
closely, Smurfs?
Papa!
Your beloved little Papa
is about to meet
his little blue end.
HANDY: No!
Upsy-daisy!
Oh, no. Papa!
SMURFETTE: Papa!
No! No!
You again!
Goodbye!
I'm really...
This ends here,
this ends now!
...really going
to enjoy this.
Gotcha!
Ahhh!
Freedom!
Son of a smurf!
Come back here!
Go, Gutsy! Yeah! Whoo!
Come back here
right now with my wand!
Oh, no. Crikey.
I... I got it.
Oh, dear.
Clumsy.
So this is how it ends.
Our goose is cooked.
Aw, this is not
gonna be good.
We're doomed.
I got it! l got it!
The vision's never been wrong.
I... I...
l got it!
My wand!
Give me back my wand!
Ahhh!
How dare you!
How dare you defy
the great and powerful...
Oh, my God.
Smurfs!
Are you dead?
GUTSY: Nice one, Clumsy!
FARMER: Are you kidding me?
GUTSY: Get up here, you!
CHEF: Yeah!
Bravo! Danke schön, Clumsy!
Patrick.
Hey.
SMURFS:  Clumsy!
Clumsy! Clumsy! Clumsy!
Clumsy, you're a hero.
I'm a hero?
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm a hero!
I'm so sorry, guys.
Definitely killed the moment.
Clumsy, you little mook, you.
Shh! It's Papa.
I owe you an apology, Clumsy.
I believed more in a vision
than I did in you.
I'm so proud of you, Clumsy.
Thanks, Papa.
I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.
And now to get rid of this!
To the portal, everyone!
There's no time to spare.
Smurf y'all later!
Bye.
I'm not one for long goodbyes,
but I did smurf together
a few words I'd like to say.
Bye.
PATRICK: Take care,
I hated this.
So much less
than I expected.
Bye, Grouchy.
Don't get me wrong,
I still hated it. Just less.
I'll not soon
forget this place.
Especially not with
these!  Tallyho!
VANITY: I shall be back,
Broadway. Tootles!
Hey, girlfriend.
Wow.
I've never had
a girlfriend before.
I'll never forget you.
Aw, Smurfette.
High four.
High four, Grace.
Hey, Smurfette.
And you.
Hi.
You, the little hero,
come here.
Hero? Oh, stop.
Well, actually,
you mind saying it
one more time?
It's kinda got
a nice ring to it.
Bye, Grace.
Well, Master Winslow,
thank you.
You saved me.
So long!
You saved my whole family.
Actually I think it was
the other way around.
Well, I should get going.
I've got a Smurf village
to rebuild.
Your village has
given me some ideas.
Come here.
Goodbye, Papa.
Goodbye, Papa.
Let's go home.
And so, the Smurfs left
the strange city of New York,
and I think they left it
a little sweeter,
a little wiser,
a little smurfier.
And as that portal began
to close for the last time.,.
Hey! Seriously, stop!
Bye, New York!
It's Odile. Hey, Odile.
Patrick, I just called
to say thank you.
Finally someone has
given me what I want.
I think I'm not fired.
Wow!
Wow. So that's a new job,
new baby...
Mmm-hmm.
...some unique new friends...
You know if you really
want a bigger place.
Bigger?
Are you crazy?
Then we'll be further apart.
Grace,
I smurf you.
Oh-oh-oh-a-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-a-oh-oh
You've got yourself things
You wanted
something for 'em
You'll either get it
or I guess you won't
What does it really mean
to get nothing from anyone?
There's a million ways
it could go
So tell me right now
You think
you're ready for it?
I wanna know
why you got me going
So let's go
We'll take it out of here
I think I'm ready to leave
I'm ready to live
I’m ready to go
Get me out of my mind
Get me out of my mind
I’m ready to go
Oh-oh-oh-a-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-a-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-a-oh-oh
I’m ready to go
Oh-oh-oh-a-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-a-oh-oh
You've got yourself things
That you've been
running from
You either love it
or I guess you don't
You're such a pretty thing
To be running from anyone
A vision with nowhere to go
So tell me right now
You think
you're ready for it?
I think I'm ready to leave
I'm ready to live
I’m ready to go
Oh-oh-oh-a-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-a-oh-oh
Smurfs. Smurfs!
I wish I could quit you.
Get out of here.
What are you looking at?
I’m ready to go
Get me out of my mind
Get me out of my mind
I’m ready to go
Oh-oh-oh-a-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-a-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-a-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-a-oh-oh
I’m ready to go
Get me out of my mind
Get me out of my mind
