Good job, guys.
I'm seeing improvement.
Hi. I was wondering
where Miss Hope
Rope-a-Dope was.
Sorry she's late.
Jimmy was moving according
to coffee-pot time,
which is usually ten minutes
fast, but it crapped out
in the middle of the night,
so we're all kinda on
microwave time today.
Gotcha.
Hey, what happened
to your dead tooth?
Oh, I got rid of it.
I thought it made me unique,
but then I saw
this hilarious episode of
and there was this girl
with a dead tooth.
Crazy, right?
And everyone was
always making
fun of her,
so before anyone made fun of me,
I figured I'd get it fixed.
Mmm.
The other kids not here yet?
Oh, no, Hope's
the only kid left.
Jessie and Phoebe moved on
to real school,
and Jenny's mother's trying the
whole stay-at-home-mom thing
now that they got her
medications sorted out.
What about the old people
you were watching?
Dead. Waiting on a new batch
to come in.
Hope's not afraid to get in
there and mix it up, though.
I'm telling you, Jimmy,
it's a great day care
and everything,
but she can't grow up
only around dogs.
How embarrassed are
you gonna be at
Sunday school when she starts
humping the minister's leg?
I appreciate your concern,
and I do wish Hope had some
other kids there,
but for now I'm sure she's fine.
Did your baby just bark?
No, maybe she burped.
Hiccup?
Okay, she barked.
What does this button do?
www.addic7ed.com
.:: Sync by Rezinha ::.
Is that another brochure
about joining the Air Force?
No, it's a brochure
for a private preschool
one of my client's kids
goes to-- Marcy.
Good kid, smart.
She reads the tabloids
to me while I'm cleaning.
We can't afford this place.
Go to the page
with the black kid.
Uh, yeah, it looks like they
have a great computer center.
No, not the picture
of the black kid
with glasses.
The one where he's high-fiving
the Mexican girl.
Ah, they have
scholarships, cool.
But these are for poor people.
What do you think we are?
I don't know.
Like, lower-lower-lower
middle class?
I'm gonna take these
to the bottle return place.
Huh, it's like a tunnel.
He does all that for $1.90,
and you think we're not poor?
Check out all those fancy
guys who went here.
Those are the presidents
of the United States.
I remember that guy.
So handsome.
Check it out.
There's one named Grover.
Grover.
All right, everybody,
these applications are due
in two weeks.
Unfortunately, we only have
enough grant money
to cover one poor student.
We are totally winning this.
There's no way these people
are poorer than us.
Okay, does anybody have
any questions?
I do. I was wondering,
I had seen on
the neighborhood watch Web site
that there was a sex offender
living not far from the school.
What's a neighborhood watch
Web site?
It's a Web site that tells you
where the people who've been
convicted of sexual-related
crimes live.
There's a blue dot over
their house.
Oh, we use the computer
at the library,
since we can't
afford our own.
No, we forced that person out.
Now the closest blue dot is way,
way, way over on
the other side of town
by the dangerous mall
in Lacey Park.
We live in Lacey Park.
By the dangerous mall.
We're so poor, we live
by the dangerous mall.
I'll kill him.
I'll strangle him
with his own perverted
sexual-offending hands!
How do you know
it's a him?
I bet it's that woman who lives
up the street
whose bushes look like wieners.
No one sees that
but you, Mom.
There it is, the blue dot.
They live really close to us.
On our block.
In our house!
Huh.
It's obviously a mistake.
It says here "lewd acts
with a 15-year-old."
It didn't happen!
It's lying!
Wait a minute.
This is ringing a bell.
Burt, you remember
Donna Passani's Sweet 16?
We were all doing it in cars
in the Knights of
Columbus parking lot,
and we got caught by a cop?
You got arrested!
Oh, yeah!
I was only 15, he was 17.
That's where
that blue dot's from.
So you sexually offended Mom?
It wasn't Burt's fault.
I developed early.
You're still that smoking hot,
nasty, sex-crazed ... to me.
You know, the school does
a background check, and we're
not gonna get in
if we have a dot on this house.
He's right.
We need to do something.
I want my granddaughter
to go to that school
and have a chance to do
great things.
Whoever heard of a rich
and successful dog?
I can think of eight
right off the bat.
Plus, Hope is gonna want
to have friends over one day,
and no one will come
because there's a stigmatism
attached to our house.
What am I supposed to do?
Make a time machine,
work the kinks out,
go back in time,
then remember
not to smush parts
with your mom?
Is that what you want?
'Cause then you
wouldn't even be born!
Just like
Am I the only one that watches
movies in this house?
Burt, this is serious business.
We'll need to hire a lawyer.
Then we'll have
to get dressed up
and go to an office park.
Come on, man!
I don't want to open this can
of worms now!
You have to!
We gotta make that dot
disappear!
There, it's gone.
When you have
legal trouble,
you don't just
need a lawyer,
you need a friend.
So call me, Wally Phipps.
I may charge
for legal services,
but the hugs
are free.
So I need you to sponge this
from my record.
Can you do that?
Well, I can get you a court date
in a week, but, uh...
Oh, Gilligan!
This is a problem.
Your registration
is in arrears.
Oh, hey, I don't know
what that cop wrote, but
we were doing it normal style.
Yeah, that is not my bag.
No, I meant you have to go
door-to-door
in your neighborhood
and identify yourself
as a sexual offender living
in the neighborhood.
Otherwise, you'll get in
even more trouble.
Hi. Are you looking for someone
to care for your lawn?
'Cause I'm not one of those
mow-and-blow guys.
I will weed, prune, plant.
I'm dependable, trustworthy.
Uh, here's my card.
Also, I'm a sex offender.
Good news,
I'm not a Jehovah's Witness.
Bad news, I'm a sex offender.
Hello, I'm your neighbor
Burt Chance.
I just wanted to let you know
there's a sexual predator
living in your neighborhood.
It's me.
About eight years ago,
I borrowed your staple gun.
Also, I'm a sexual predator.
Hey, I'm shaving ham here, man!
You're not being funny.
I'm not trying to be funny.
I, uh, finished proofing
Hope's preschool application.
You're a pretty big fan
of exclamation points, huh?
Yeah, I thought
it made it more exciting.
Is this more exciting?!
Or does it just seem
like I'm weird?!
Yeah, okay, well, that's why
I wrote it in pencil, see?
We're gonna need to jazz this
form up a bit.
You got to sell
yourself, like, um,
say you served in Iraq.
No, Afghanistan.
It's a better war.
Would you stop it?!
Stuff like this is why Barney
doesn't let you use the slicer.
I don't want to use the slicer.
Listen, seriously,
you're gonna have
to spice this up
a little.
I'm not gonna lie.
I don't want Hope's future
based on dishonesty.
Well, suit yourself,
Mr. Honesty.
But whatever you do...
take it easy on the exclams!
It's my birthday.
Maw Maw, release!
Why couldn't we leave
her home?
Because I broke a glass
in the kitchen,
and I wasn't in the mood
to clean it up.
Burt and I need to get
to the judge's chambers.
But after, I'd love
to tell you
how you could use
your broken glass
to make a lovely mosaic
for your patio.
Come on.
Oh, gotta hang back.
You can't be near
those kids, Burt.
You're a sex offender.
No, uh, I'm not a perv
or anything.
I just made love
with my teenage wife.
It's cool! I gave him
the green light!
They've been talking to
the judge a long time.
Oh, man.
I hope Dad didn't
get frustrated
and do his crank-up-his-
middle-finger thing.
Yeah, he's definitely in
a finger-cranking mood today.
I got one this morning
when I got the last Eggo.
Good news.
They overturned
my dot.
Take that, justice system.
Some old lady
took her shirt off.
Best field trip ever!
talk to the judge
and explain that your Maw Maw
is a teeny bit bonkadoo,
he'll get rid of the
dot as soon as she
does 12 hours
of community service.
She's only awake for
three hours at a time.
Well, some of those kids
were pretty shook up.
Yeah. First time you see 'em,
it can be pretty rough.
I still can't eat dried fruit
without heaving a little first.
Well, let's see
what has a need right now.
Bip, bip, bip, bip...
here we go.
Picking up trash on Highway 80.
She's going to have
to do that tomorrow,
because the application's
due the day after.
She can't even get her own
toilet paper in the toilet.
How is she going to get strange
trash in a strange trash can?
Well, she has to.
A while back,
I slipped on a wig and did
my wife's community service
when she got arrested
for spousal abuse.
Point is,
that any woman can sign in
and do the job.
I hate all of you.
Thank you for having me
on the show, Johnny.
Hey, thanks for
doing this.
I packed you a lunch
of all orange things
so you wouldn't have to worry
about staining your jumpsuit.
It's mostly cheese puffs
and jelly beans.
Dad, what are you doing?
Shh. He's sleep-eating.
He does it every night.
You know, I'm starting to think
we should have left Hope
in that dog pound
day care.
She could still
be successful.
Just strap her to a
blind person and call it a day.
How is he not, like, 500 pounds?
He sleep-exercises.
Okay.
Let's do this.
You sure you don't want
to brush your hair?
Oh, right.
'Cause if I'm going to be
picking up beer bottles
and old rubbers,
I really want to look my best.
Got to pee, got to pee,
got to pee, pee, pee.
Got to pee, got to pee,
got to pee. Whoo!
He won't give me the key
unless I buy something.
Give me some money.
They don't have anything
for 26 cents.
Don't you have any more money?
No, that's it.
Try the "take a penny,
leave a penny" jar.
Hey, Jimmy.
Hey. Hey, Dancing Dan.
Nobody left a penny.
Sign of the times.
Hey, what are you going
to do with that?
Hey.
What in the Lord?
I can't believe
you're arresting me.
Watch your head.
The real crime is what
those people are charging
for a pack of gum in there.
Mom, what's going on?
We just caught your mother
relieving herself
behind the gas station.
She's being arrested
for indecent exposure.
What am I supposed to do?
I need to find someone
to pick up litter
in like five minutes.
I got bigger problems, Jimmy.
My mug shot's going
to look terrible.
Excuse me, miss.
I'd like to pay you
to pretend to be my
great-grandmother
on the side of the road.
It'll be dirty, but...
That hooker was wearing a wire.
I heard the whole thing
on the walkie-talkie.
It's like watching
your kid drown
and not being able
to tell him to shut up.
I know I've said lying's bad,
but, I mean,
half the games we play are lies.
Like peekaboo?
I'm not really gone.
Still here.
What I'm saying is,
I think I have to use
our neighbor's address
on this form,
although I wish
I didn't have to.
You know, I wouldn't have
to do all this
if you weren't doing dog stuff
like barking or...
Chewing bones?
Who gave Hope a steak bone?
She fetched my slippers.
I keep my promises.
Oh, man.
I got to get you away
from these dogs.
Think I have to lie about more
than just our address.
Excuse me.
Everybody?
I would like to thank
you all for applying.
All of you had
such compelling stories.
The O'Donnells.
Both of you working three jobs
while living
in another family's basement,
somehow using a hot plate
to heat your bathwater.
Oh, and Mr. Melman.
Mr. Melman volunteers
every single day
in a downtown soup kitchen.
The Sanchezes had to float
to this country
on an inner tube
with nothing but a stick
to fight off the shark attacks.
Oh, and the Hassecks,
who are functionally mute.
But one story stood out.
Would you come up here,
Jim Chance?
Come on.
Don't be shy.
James Chance,
single father who gave up
a promising career in art
to fight for his country
in Afghanistan,
only to injure
his drawing hand
while carrying several
orphans to safety.
Then, when he
came back,
he was carjacked by a
man desperate for money
to pay for a
kidney transplant.
And who do you suppose
gave him the kidney?
ALL:
James Chance.
The scholarship goes
to Hope Chance.
Congratulations.
Yeah, I-I'm sorry
to have to do this,
but the unchosen will
have to leave now.
Thank you.
Just... mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Wait.
I lied on my application.
What?
I lied on my application.
I didn't even want to lie,
but it all started when...
when I had to fake my address
because we have blue dots.
We're... we're
sexual offenders.
Excuse me?
But it's all
a misunderstanding, right?
My parents hooked up
as teenagers,
my great-grandmother runs around
without her bra on,
and I tried to get a favor
from a hooker.
Okay, but it wasn't
a sexual favor.
I really wanted to get my
daughter into this school.
I'm sorry.
Uh... I'm really sorry.
That was very brave,
Mr. Chance.
Coming clean like that,
that took courage.
Really?
Cool.
Wait. Wait,
wait, wait.
I can be brave, too.
I don't really volunteer
at the soup kitchen.
I have OCD--
one, two, three, four, five--
and... and I think
that homeless people are filthy.
One, two, three, four, five.
Uh, we didn't really come here
on an inner tube.
Sure, our name is Sanchez,
but we're about as Latino
as the Three Amigos.
Uh, we can speak.
In fact, my wife here
will hardly ever shut up.
And she hits me.
Hey.
I also lied
about my kid's mother.
She was a serial killer.
I didn't even get into that.
Yeah, my penis is tiny.
Okay, uh-uh.
Wow, Jimmy.
Thanks for telling so many
people about my school.
This place is great.
It just needed
more kids.
Okay, everybody,
I think we're ready to
sing the welcome song.
