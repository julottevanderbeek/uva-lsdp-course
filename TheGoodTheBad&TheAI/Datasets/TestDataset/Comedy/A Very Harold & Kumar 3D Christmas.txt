Tonight. Christmas Eve.
At a party she's throwing
in Manhattan. Best part:
- You're coming with me.
- No can do, man.
I gotta stay here and smoke this weed,
otherwise I won't get high.
Why not ask your roommate?
Because you're the best.
I don't wanna go with him.
I already asked him. He said no.
He's spending Christmas...
...with his stupid girlfriend.
Mm. This is what happens.
They get a girlfriend...
...then they get married...
...then you never hear from them again.
Fuck it, I'm in.
Yes.
TODD: Wow, the Jewish neighbors
must hate this.
Well, Harry. Harry.
You have outdone yourself.
HAROLD:
If you knew Maria's dad...
...you'd pull out all the stops too.
Has not accepted you
as part cf the family?
No, not yet. But he's a huge fan cf
Christmas. I'm hoping when he sees...
...all the work, he appreciates it.
Oh, so smart.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Oh. Jinx.
You always do that.
You keep doing it. it's crazy.
Okay, I'll Skype you later or text you.

Somebody is also...

Um ...
Your dad is gonna be here any minute,
though. Honestly, that's--
- Baby. Then let's get to it.
- Oh!
Because when they get here...
...we are going to have no private time.
I don't know if we should.
Now, came on and fuck a baby into me.
Okay, I will.
Two-hander. Okay. Ha-ha-ha.
If it's a baby I gotta give you,
it's a baby you're gonna get.
BOTH:
Shit.
Ga. Ga.
Be cool.
Carlos, Merry Christmas.
Hello, Harold.
You made the drive in record time.
Didn't speed, did you?
Empanadas?
Where's Maria?
HAROLD:
She's upstairs...
...getting ready.
Can I get you a beer?
What the hell is that?
HAROLD:
She caught your eye, huh? Ha, ha.
This is cur Christmas tree.
Is it fake?
It's faux, actually.
You celebrating real Christmas...
...or a faux Christmas?
Real Christmas?
MARIA:

HAROLD:

It's just the weekend.
NARRATOR :

This stupid waffle's stuck.
MOM:
Oh, my God! Billy!
- Heh-heh-heh.

NARRATOR:

KUMAR:
I'm busy, Adrian! Go away!
VANESSA:
Kumar! it's Vanessa.
Hey. Locks like somebody missed me.
Come on in.
Since when do you have a beard?
I actually have not shaved since you left.
Pretty romantic.
Kind of like Ryan Gosling
in The Notebook.
VANESSA:
When's the last time you cleaned?
Like three months ago.
Less romantic?
Little bit, yeah.
I'm sorry, where are my manners?
Here. Here.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I shouldn't.
Of course you should.
Kumar, I really need to talk to you.
I'm pregnant.
You're pregnant?
We--
We practiced safe sex.
I mean, I pulled cut
and came on your back.
A couple squeaks get by...
...but is that all it takes?
- Yes.
That's all. No wonder
you flunked out of med school.
I didn't flunk cut cf med school.
I failed a drug test.
How do I even know...
...that the baby's mine?
I haven't slept with anyone
since we broke up.
Nice.
What do you want to do about it?
All right, um ...
This is the part
where the kid's tongue...
...gets stuck to a pale. Ha, ha.
Oh. Ha, ha. I'm sorry.
Um, are we having a conversation right now,
or are you watching A Christmas Story?
Bath. No.
- I mean--
- You know what? I knew you...
...couldn't handle this.
- I'm sorry.
I'm really high.
This is not about you being high.
This is about you being immature.
It's why I couldn't stay here any more.
You are perfectly fine
creating a mess...
...but when it comes
to cleaning one up...
...you're MIA.
Give me a half hour...
...to saber up.
Fuck.
Dad, you good?
You need a drink or--? No? Okay.
- Maria. I love you.
- Ha, ha.
Glad your family's here.
I'm just wondering...
...how we're gonna deal with the Christmas
party with all these extra guests.
We'll make it work.
We have plenty cf room.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
I left my wallet upstairs. Thank you.
Harold.
Hey, speaking cf guests...
...are you sure you don't
wanna invite Kumar?
Kumar? You kidding me?
I haven't seen that guy in years.
MARIA:
Kumar has been...
...your friend for a lang time.
- It is perfectly normal.
People lose half their friends
every seven years.
It's not like I don't have friends.
- Todd? Yeah, he's a Int cf fun.
- At least he doesn't...
...create a disaster everywhere he goes.
Ah, okay.
Rosetta Stone.
A lifesaver.
KUMAR:
Be right there!
Harold? He hasn't lived here in so long.
Maybe we can--
Are you sure we have to...
...throw it cut?
- This tree is a cancer.
We have to get rid cf it
before it kills Christmas.
Very intense wording.
MARIA:
Wow! Oh, my God.
I can't believe you brought the tree.
Ha-ha-ha.
Am I missing something?
Every Christmas we use a tree
that Dad grew.
- Oh.
MR. PEREZ: Twelve-fact Fraser fir.
Lock at the branch distribution.
Oh, I see.
Hey, hey!
She's very delicate.
I've been growing her for eight years.
Eight years, wow. I never knew
Christmas trees were such a big deal.
Oh, God.
Not a big deal?
Let me tell you a story, Harold.
Growing up in Medellin...
...my family was too poor
to celebrate Christmas properly.
Every year I would pray to God:
"Please, let me wake up and find a big,
beautiful Christmas tree."
And every Christmas...
...I was heartbroken.
When my mother finally
moved me to America...
...she promised me we would have...
...a Christmas tree every Christmas
from then on.
But one week before that first Christmas,
while walking home from work...
...she was violently attacked...
...by a gang cf Korean punks.
They stabbed her multiple times.
She bled to death.
So I guess...
...you could say, yes,
a Christmas tree is a big deal.
Oh, my God.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Pm sorry.
Pepe! Where are the ornaments?
I don't know.
My eyes are all fucked up.
You can't celebrate Christmas
with a naked tree! it's indecent!
Maria, forget about midnight Mass.
Tonight, we're decorating the tree.
Oh, Daddy, I wanted
to spend tonight in the city...
...with you guys.
Wait.
I get this.
I'll take care cf the tree.
You have a family night in Manhattan.
No. No, no, no.
We brought the tree all the way dawn.
It has to lack perfect
on Christmas morning.
Carlos, it will. Tell me exactly what
you want and I'll take care cf it.
When you came back,
the tree will be decorated.
This house, I promise you,
is gonna be perfect.
ADRIAN: Oh, B-T-dub, the girl tonight?
Her name is Mary.
As in the Virgin Mary.
How great is that?
What did Vanessa do to suck...
...the life cut cf you...
...this afternoon?
I don't have anyone else to confide in.
I might as well tell you. Uh ...
Vanessa's pregnan--
A queefer.
- What?
- I knew it.
I used to date this black chick,
she used to queef every time we had sex.
It was ridiculous.
I used to call her Queen Laqueefa.
When was the last time
you saw this guy?
- Two years ago.
- Sc...
...why are we dropping off this package?
You said this guy was a chode.
He is, all right? I just--
I don't want his shit in my place.
KUMAR:
Sure this is the right address?
Whoa. Locks like your ex-boyf's
moving up in the world. Heh.
I guess.
I'll be right back.
I'm just gonna drop this off.
Fuck!
Kumar?
Hello, Harold.

- How are you? Good to see you.

...or something?
Um ...

- Oh.
- Oh.
- Came in, came in. Come in. Come on.
- Sure.
Watch your step, it's icy there.
Eggnog? Empanadas?
Uh ... Sure. Yeah.
Hey, this place is, like, not shitty.
Oh. Thank you. Yeah.
Bay window is brand-new, actually.
We just put that in last week.
The sconces are new.
Sconces are actually brand-new.
Yeah, I was gonna say, it lacks like
you guys get some awesome sconces.
Thank you. That's very sweet cf you.
So, what's up with this package?
HAROLD:
My name and your address. That's weird.
I haven't lived there for so long.
I know. That's strange.
HAROLD:
Whoa.
Ooh.
HAROLD:
What the hell is this?
That's a gigantic joint.
What do you think?
HAROLD:
IS this a joke?
- No. I swear.
- Did you do this?
Had I known, I would have smoked it.
Is there a--?
No return address.
I don't even see any stamps on this.
What are you doing?
Getting not low.
No smoking in this house.
What? What douche came up
with that rule?
HAROLD:
This douche did.
That was good shit.
HAROLD:
I don't care, okay?
I don't smoke any more.
- What?
- I just felt...
...that a Int cf times when I get high...
...things would go really wrong. Sc...
But, Harold, weed is so good.
It gets you high.
I get nothing against weed, okay?
Had plenty of fun times with weed.
But I'm an adult now.
And frankly, I'm kind cf glad that
the craziness is behind me.
Dc you smell something burning?
BOTH:
Oh, Shit!
KUMAR: Oh, Shit.
- Shit.
Shit!
It's spreading. it's spreading!
Here.
Bah, bah, bah!
Not the throw pillows!
Seriously?
I did it anyway!
HAROLD:
What the fuck?!
Shit!
HAROLD:
Maria's dad will kill me!
Stop yelling!
We gotta get rid cf this tree!
Okay.
That's why you gotta buy those
faux trees. They last forever.
Calm dawn.
It's just a Christmas tree.
"Just a Christmas tree"?
Maria's dad grew that tree...
...and new it is dead.
Koreans have killed his mother,
and new this tree. Christmas is ruined.
Christmas isn't ruined.
Yes, it is. You have ruined Christmas.
They're gonna came home from Mass
and expect to see...
...a decorated tree,
but they are gonna see that.
Dude, you're overreacting.
There's plenty cf tree lots.
We'll drive around
till we find the right tree.
We're not gonna do anything.
You know what? Um, this is my fault.
I take full responsibility.
Please leave.
I will take care cf this. Thank you.
- I don't mind helping cut--
- I get it.
- We have a van--
- I get it.
Okay. You get it.
- You need anything, just give me--
- Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Harold.
What the fuck tack so long?
Nothing. Let's just go.
You never told me Harold was Asian.
I always pictured an old white guy.
TODD: Freeze! This is a robbery.
Give me all your friendship.
Oh, wow, lack at that.
You know, it's kind cf better
than a window.
It's like a stained-glass
window cf paper.
Any luck with the tree?
- Oh, you brought Ava.
- Uh, yeah, sorry. I have Ava.
Il's "3D."
Hmm?

Oh, here it goes. Here it goes.

Crawled up the water spout

Really? A tree farm?
"Best selection"...

It's Christmas Eve, okay?
What do you expect?
KUMAR:

These trees are ghetto.

He's just playing.
How you doing? I'm Latrell.
Hello. Kumar.
This is my partner in crime, Lamar.
- So you two own this tree lot?
LAMAR: What?

With a brand-new swag
Dude, do you feel kind cf weird?
Yeah, I do, actually.
My face is feeling kind cf numb.
Oh, fuck.
The kids put something in here.
Was it drugs? Was it semen?
It doesn't taste like semen.
MARY:
Uh! You fucking...
...loser!
- Give me another chance!
I'm begging you!

Sir. Hi. My name is Kumar, this is Harold.
It's very nice to meet you.
Um, I know this is gonna be hard
for you to believe...
...but your daughter, sir, was the one
who was trying to rape us.
She's the raper.
No! No, no, no! That is not true, Daddy.
These men came in here,
I didn't know who they were.
I think that they get me drunk.
No. Miss? Miss? That's incorrect.
You get my daughter drunk?
Sir, if I may. This is all a big ...
Let me pull my pants up.
It's all a big misunderstanding.
Your children threw the party.
We have nothing to do with all the drugs
and all the alcohol.
Okay, listen up!
Party's over!
My baby...
...is fucked on cocaine!
KATSOV: I've heard enough.
Gustav.
- What? Oh, shit!
- No! No!
Why does it always have to be "Gustav"?
- Why not "Yuri and Gustav, kill them"?
- He means both.
Why can't he say bath cf us?
Bath cf you...
...kill them. Kill them all!
- Aah!
KUMAR: Go!
Now!
TODD:
Unh, ah! Ava!
Come with me if you wanna live!
What? No, no!
No, no, no!
Aah. Where's my baby?
- Ava! Ava!
- Shh!
Where could my baby be?
Where's my baby?
Your cake baby has superpowers.
- That was close.
- I know, right?
HAROLD:
Were you starting to trip cut a little bit?
Because I think I was starting
to trip cut back there a little bit.
Yeah, definitely, man. I think there
was something in the eggnog.
It's pretty fucking sweet.
Don't worry.
I'm pretty sure it's wearing off.
Or maybe not?
Holy shit! Dude, you're Claymated!
Ha-ha-ha. Sc are you!
Sc is he.
What's up, bland?
Dude, everything's Claymated!
Fuck you!
KUMAR:
This is great!
No, it's not! How am I supposed
to get a tree now? I'm made of clay.
Ooh, hold on. I have an idea.
What the hell--?
Yah!
KUMAR: Clay cocks!
- Put your cock away.
Dude, relax. it's gonna wear off scan.
HAROLD:
Dude, are you seeing what I'm seeing?
What the fuck?
KUMAR: Don't worry, nothing had
ever happens in Claymation.
Whoa!
Shit!
Fuck!
Dude, lack cut!
KUMAR:
Come on, let's hide...
...in that tree.
Dude, came on!
HAROLD & KUMAR:
Aww.
Hey, little guy.
Just wanna take you home
and cuddle with you all night long.
You hungry?
Fuck me!
Mommy!
Hold me!
- Roldy!
- Kumar!
- What the hell's the matter?
ROSENBERG: What are you doing?
- Rosenberg.
- Goldstein?
We were doing last-minute shopping
with my boy here when we saw you...
...tearing that snowman a new tuchus.
ROSENBERG:
You are gonna catch your death...
...of cold out here.
Let's get you a nice meal.
Is there somewhere we can eat?
This is why I tell you not
to have people over.
Every single other person
get cut cf here except for us.
- I knew you'd bring that up.
- You grabbed me.
You said, "Came with me
if you want to live."
- Man, I don't think that's okay.
-It's fine.
It's not fine! My baby's on cocaine.
I'm on cocaine.
I'm addicted to cocaine.
Yo! Idiots!
I want you to find...
...the men who violated...
...my daughter...
...and I want you to fucking kill them!
- Still hits the spat.
HAROLD: I know, right?
Oh, I almost forgot. Harold,
my Uncle Yoav, he threw his back cut.
So me and him, we're not gonna...
...be able to make your party.
- I'm so sorry about that.
-It's okay.
There's not really a-- We should get going.
We get a Christmas tree emergency.
I don't understand what it is
with you people and your trees.
GOLDSTEIN:
For us Christians...
...the tree is a very important
part cf cur holiday.
Okay, don't start with this. All right?
Just because your wife made you convert
doesn't mean you're not a Jew!
His name is Seth Goldstein.
For Christ's sake!
First cf all, don't ever take the Lord's...
...name in vain. Secondly...
...I was baptized, bitch!
The second the priest...
...poured that holy water over me...
...all my Jewish neurosis and self-hatred
just washed right off.
KUMAR: Sounds like you're enjoying
your new religion.
Dude, it's the balls.
These dirty Jew bastards have...
...no idea what they're missing.
Fishing! Hunting!
I tie knots on a sailboat.
I made terrible investments...
...doesn't bother me a bit.
And guess what. Next week...
...I have an appointment
to get uncircumcised.
That's right, I'm gonna get my snozzle.
Guys, I'd love to stay and chat
but I gotta go get this tree.
Christmas tree! Christmas tree!
It's glorious. isn't it Christian?
Great to see you guys.
KUMAR: See you, guys.
GOLDSTEIN: No, wait.
Excuse me!
You still awe me 87 cents
for that jalapeno cheeseburger!
Ah! Guess that holy water didn't
wash everything off, new did it?
HAROLD:
God, that tree is perfect.
KUMAR:
Let's go check it cut.
Tickets, please.
I'm sorry, we don't have tickets.
They sold cut months ago.
- But--
- Step aside, please.
I said step aside.
Shit.
You know what? Fuck it,
it's almost midnight. I give up.
You can't give up yet.
Lack...
...I have an idea on haw we might
get that tree cut.
- What?
-It's not gonna be easy.
But this may be
the last chance we've got.
Here's what we do.
First, we need to steal some tickets.
Then I slip off to the side
and take out the archbishop.
I head down
to the nuns' shower room.
HAROLD: I didn't know the nuns
all showered in the same room.
How do you think they stay so clean?
While the nuns are lezzing it out,
I'm gonna snag the key to the back room.
HAROLD:
What back room?
The back room that the priests
are guarding. Am I going too fast?
- No.
- Okay, good.
You're in charge cf distracting them.
How the hell do I do that?
KUMAR: That's easy, you'll just use
our secret weapon.
Pillow fight in the altar boys' room.
Last one there's a rotten egg.
KUMAR: Once the coast is clear, we use
the key to get into the back room.
I guard while you kill the power.
While everyone's trying
to turn the power on...
...you and I will get the tree.
We take it to your place,
and when Maria's dad comes home...
...and sees this beautiful tree...
...in your living room,
he'll jizz all over it.
What do you think?
INEZ:
Uncle Harold.
I think I see Uncle Harold over there.
What do you mean,
you see Uncle Harold?
Baby?
Oh, sorry, sir.
MR. PEREZ:
it's okay, baby.
They all look alike to me too.
Ha-ha-ha.
HAROLD: Fuck! Midnight Mass.
Is it midnight already? Fucking midnight!
Running cut cf time.
Wait, wait, wait!
What the hell are we doing?
Hold on. What the hell's going on?
He almost spotted us!
I'm supposed to be at home with the tree.
But why are you making
such a big deal about this?
Because it is a big deal.
Who gives a shit what
your father-in-law thinks?
I give a shit what my father-in-law thinks.
You wouldn't understand.
No, dude, I don't understand.
You got a great job, you make good money,
you don't beat your wife.
What more could a Latino
father-in-law ask for?
- Well ...
- If I were you...
...I'd tell him to eat
a cockmeat sandwich.
You should not go through...
...all this just to make him happy.
You're right, I don't have to.
I want to.
I want him to be happy
because I want Maria to be happy.
Because what makes Maria happy
is what makes me happy.
Don't you get it?
I don't have to be doing this.
I wanna be doing this.
What the fuck?
Smoke break ended 10 minutes ago!
We need all bodies on-stage!

How has this affected your relationship
with your partner, David?
Well, maybe this'll answer
your question.
So hot, NPH.
Mm, mm. Ha-ha-ha.
Hey. How about that?
Thank you. I love you guys.
Ugh. What did I tell you

We saw you get shot.
You have to be more specific.
In that whorehouse.
In Texas.
You branded a prostitute.
Remember?
Oh, yeah!
Now I remember.
It hurt like hell...
...at first.
And then...
...everything faded away.
And I went to heaven.
It was exactly...
...like I imagined it.
Saint Peter was there...
...to meet me.
Whoa. No way!
- NPH?
- Yup.
ST. PETER:
Make room! Make room! VIP!
NEIL: The chicks were hot.
The music was sick.
There were lasers.
It was like being famous...

...interrupted by some dirty hippie.
Neil Patrick Harris. My man.
I'm sure you recognize me...
...but I'm Jesus. Sc...
Jesus...?
Jesus Christ. That's me.
I'm Jesus Christ, Neil.
Hey, ladies.

Sc, girls ...
Aw, came on.
How did that happen already?
Give me the phone to Dad.
GOD: This is God.
- Daddy?
We need to 86 NPH ASAP.
He's getting a handjob in my club.
Jesus, what a cockblock.
Doesn't explain the gay thing.
You're not gay, motherfucker.
At all.
That's a little something
we magicians call "misdirection."
Little trick I learned...
...from Clay Aiken.
HAROLD: What?
Clay Aiken's not gay?
Clay's the biggest coozehound I know.
That guy gets mad gash.
HAROLD:
Neil, listen.
I was wandering if--
I can get you one cf those
Christmas trees?
Sure, no problem.
How'd you know that?
I can read your mind.
KUMAR:
All right.
You might be able to--?
Hack you up with a free WaffleBot?
You know what? Take mine.
I hate that android fuck.
Don't call him that, dude.
What's up, WaffleBot?
Waffles are awesome.
Pancakes suck, right?
I hate pancakes.
I know, so do I.
Kumar.
Thanks, Neil.
- Thanks.
NEIL: No problem.
Hey, merry Christmas, guys.
We'll see you in the fourth one.
HAROLD: God, this is amazing. We're
actually gonna make it home before they do.
- We saved Christmas, man.
KUMAR: Mission accomplished.

- Unh!
HAROLD: All right.

All right. Oh, God.
Oh, my God. WaffleBot.
Dude, seriously...

Kumar and WaffleBot friends forever.
Ha, ha. No doubt, WaffleBot.
I love you...
...Kumar.
- Ha, ha.
I love you too, little guy.
HAROLD:
What the fuck?
That is the weirdest fucking toy.
You're happy.
See? You're laughing.
You're having fun. Admit it:
I'm more fun to hang cut with than Todd.
Todd and Ava.
I totally forgot about them.
I'm sure they're fine, right?
It's going to voicemail.
I think they're fine.
Todd's a big boy.
He's probably putting her
to bed or something.
Yeah. They're probably fine, right?
MADEA :
Look at me, look at me!
Why wasn't you at school today?
I went to the park.
She lying.
MADEA: What was you doing?
You supposed to be at school.
Little girl, I'm not gonna
ask you no more.
NIKKI: I'm not smart like the other kids.
I can't do that stuff.
MADEA:
Who told you that?
NIKKI:
My last foster mother.
She told me that the only thing I'm gonna
be smart enough to do is lay on my back.
MADEA: The best revenge you can have
on somebody that told you that...
...is to prove them wrong. l went to
that school and I got your homework.
TODD :
Are you fucking kidding me?
- Oh.
- Oh.
Maybe that's Todd.
Whoa, why is Vanessa calling you?
Oh, that's because Maria is--
- Hello?
VANESSA: Kumar?
- Is that you?
- Yeah.
Why are you calling Harold?
Can I just speak to him, please?
What? No.
I've been texting you.
I haven 't heard back.
What's going on?
Tell him I'm not gonna...
...make it to his party tomorrow.
Oh. Oh, you're not gonna make it--
She won't make it to your party.
Too bad.
What else have you been
doing behind my back?
Has she seen your dick?
Is it bigger than mine?
Kumar, you're acting ridiculous, okay?
Goodbye.
No, don't hang up the phone on me.
Hello?
Here's your phone.
What is that?
That's Vanessa, Todd,
Rosenberg, Uncle Yoav.
Does everybody know
about this party?
Listen, if you want you can come.
I don't wanna came to your
shitty-ass party, dude.
I can't believe you'd invite
Vanessa and not tell me.
Am I supposed to feel bad?
Maybe if you acted more like an adult,
you'd get invited to adult parties.
Maybe you should go back
to your fancy house...
...with your douchey friends
and gay-ass sconces.
I don't need to be part cf this.
I love those sconces.
You know, I was really happy
till you showed up today.
Okay. Well, then, fuck it, dude.
- I'm cut.
- Fine with me.
Fine.
- Cool.
- All right.
- Are we having lovers' quarrel?
-oh, shim.
Kumar, my friend.
Oh, lock.
A WaffleBot.
GUSTAV:
Mary would...
...love one cf these.
- Uh-huh.
GUSTAV:
Grab it.
Oh, crap.
GUSTAV:
Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up.
- Wake up.
- Oh.
Oh, sun.
Please, I don't know what we've done,
but please let us go.
After you made Eiffel Tower on Mary?
That was a misunderstanding.
I'm freezing!
Give us back cur clothes.
Yuri, warm them up.
WAFFLEBOT:
Kumar.
KUMAR:
Please don't do that.
Please, please, please.
There is a very serious gas crisis...
...in the world. Let's discuss.
- Came on, man!
As they say in my country:
No, don't say "do svidaniya."
Come on.
You didn't get the lighter.
You said gasoline, Orbits and coffee.
Nothing about lighter.
GUSTAV:
You stupid...
...fucking moron!
You're such a fuck-up!
Oh, sun.
Hey, guys, stop!
Stop! Guys, guys, stop it, stop it.
Now, look, I understand that you guys
have your issues, okay?
But wasn't there a time you actually
used to get along? You might be in...
...a different time and place,
but that doesn't change the fact that you...
...have along and probably
beautiful history together.
Yeah, maybe one cf you fucks up
every new and again.
Happens.
Maybe he fucks up all the time.
Doesn't mean the other should
forget about the good times.
Right.
Right.
Yeah, and maybe just
because the other one...
...is trying to act like an adult...
...and be responsible
doesn't necessarily mean...
...that he's being a fucking chode.
Maybe he's been a chode,
caring more about bay windows...
...and sconces
than a lifetime cf friendship.
What do you say, guys?
- Yeah, hug it cut.
- All right.
Hey, guys.
How about you cut us cut?
We'll go get ourselves
a Christmas beer.
- A beer sounds great.
HAROLD: Awesome.
GUSTAV:
But first...
...we have some killing to do.
Come on!
After we just had that breakthrough?
Sorry. Say your goodbyes.
It'll all be over quick.
- Is this haw we die?
- I think so, dude.
Bye, Kumar.
Bye, Harold.
WAFFLEBOT:
Kumar.
Your waffles...
...are ready.
- WaffleBot?
These guys think pancakes
are better than waffles.
I hate...
...pancakes.
They serve pancakes...
...in hell.
Och!
BOTH:
Holy shit!
You hurt my brother!
KUMAR:
Whoo!
- How do we get cut cf these rapes?
- WaffleBot.
Kumar.
Can you untie us?
Battery low.
Losing...
power.
WaffleBot, lack at me.
You can do this, man.
- Ha, ha.
- Oh, man. Thanks, WaffleBot.
You're welcome, Kumar.
Pancakes are fucking gay.
Holy Shit. That is the best
Christmas toy ever.
HAROLD:
I guess. it's extraordinarily...
...unsafe, but it did save our lives.
- Listen, man, I--
- Man, this--
- Aah!
- Oh, my God.
Holy shit!
This is like that...
...scene from A Christmas Story.
Is it like the scene from
A Christmas Story?
I just saw this scene.
- Oh, fuck!
- Okay, we need...
...same sort cf a warm liquid.
I'll spit on it.
Don't fucking spit on my dick!
Fine. Can you pee on it?
Give me a second.
-It's not working.
- Fine, I'll pee on it.
Don't pee on me!
Jesus! Well, then what the hell do--?
- Oh. Our clothes.
- Oh.
Cool about the clothes.
My dick's stuck to a pale!
Dude, you're in luck.
There's still coffee in here.
Get it over here. Hurry the fuck up!
Okay, lock, this is scalding hat coffee.
Sc I'm just gonna pour a little bit on.
Probably gonna sting for a second.
- Get it over with!
- All right.
Just let me just--
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck!
Oh, fuck! I'm sorry, dude!
Oh, God, I ruined your dick!
You asshole!
Just Walk it off.
Walk it off.
How lang are we supposed
to stay in here?
TODD :
Until that fucking Russian sociopathic...
...killing machine leaves.
They gave my daughter ecstasy.
I don't know Russian,
but he seems a little upset.
I'd say so. Shh, shh!
ADRIAN:
She's crashing hard.
We gotta give her more blow.
No, no! No more cocaine!
I need it!
- There's some.
- Dc not give her mare!
Give it to me!
TODD:
Ava, no! No, please!
Stop for Daddy. Shh, shh! Please!
ADRIAN:
Dude, lock.
Oh, this is not good!
Oh, this is not good.
Oh, this is not good!
Ava! Scooch to Daddy!
Hide behind Daddy!
ADRIAN:
New plan. Let's bash through the door.
You steal his gun.
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard!
TODD:
Yah!
Oh, fuck me. Fuck. I'm--
I'm so sorry. Wow.
I thought that would
knock you out, obviously.
Lack. We are...
...two reasonable guys...
...and...
These are dangerous,
but, aw, it's a great workout.
You can really feel it.
Bis, pecs, this one.
TODD:
Thank you, Adrian.
That was a really great team effort.
Who's my sidekick? You are.
Let's go.
Good girl! Let's go home!
Let's go see Santa.
Oh, mints!
Mm.
HAROLD:
Where the fuck are we?
Those guys weren't kidding.
We're in the middle cf nowhere.
Dc you have any bars?
- I get no bars.
- Shit. Nothing here.
Hello?
Anybody here?
Forget it. Just--
Forget it. it's past 2 a.m.
They're home, wandering where I am,
where the tree is.
I just--
it's such a disaster, this fucking night.
Yeah, you have no fucking idea, dude.
No. When Maria's dad...
...was a young boy in Medellin--
- Vanessa's pregnant.
What?
She told me earlier today.
My reaction was not awesome.
I thought weed stunted fertility.
That's why I quit.
Yeah. Tell that to Snoop's kids.
Wait a second,
that's why you quit weed?
Yeah, that's why I--
We've been trying for like a ...
For a year.
Oh, man.
Now I feel even worse about your dick.
I don't wanna--
How do we get cut?
I get an idea.
I saw this in a movie, man.
Just shoot this motherfucker,
people come.
We can find people.
No, it's fine. Aah!
Now what?
I don't know.
No fucking way.
Santa, can you hear me?
Oh, what the fuck?
Lie still. You've been in a terrible accident.
I'm gonna take a closer lock.
Oh, God!
This isn't good.
Mr. Claus, can you feel...
...any cf this?
SANTA:
Just let me die, please!
Let me die in peace!
No. Nobody's dying, Claus.
Not on my watch.
Listen to me. I need you to go
into Santa's gift bag...
...get as many medical supplies
as you can.
Oh, God!
Aah!
KUMAR:
Ah, there.
I think that'll do it.
How do you feel, Mr. Claus?
Uh, a little woozy.
The morphine. It'll wear off.
Nice. But I...
...think I'm okay.
Lack, Santa, we're so sorry.
Oh, I know it wasn't your fault.
You two have always been good boys.
Tell that to my father-in-law.
Hey, man, I can take the blame
for that, all right?
Listen, I'd love to stay and chat...
...but I'm running a little late
and I have all these...
...presents to deliver.
So you guys need a ride
or something?
Seriously?
KUMAR:
Ha, ha. Dude, this is awesome!
It's not not awesome!
On, Blitzen! Hyah!
Thanks for the ride.
I'm guessing...
...you don't have a 12-fact Fraser fir?
Sorry. I can't help you there.
Besides...
...I gave you your present.
- You did?
SANTA: Yes.
You get my package, right?
The joint?
- That was you?
SANTA: Yeah.
It was my little way cf bringing
you bays back together.
Dude...
...I'd really like it
if you came over tomorrow.
Won't be a party unless you're there.
It's about fucking time, Roldy.
I wouldn't miss it, man.
By the way, for what it's worth...
...you'd make a great dad.
SANTA:
Well, I guess...
...this is goodbye, Roldy.
Be a good bay...
...next year.
All right.
No more jerking off into a sack
filled with baby powder.
.L..
SANTA: Ha, ha. Don't worry.
I'm just teasing you.
I do it too.
On, Prancer! On, Comet!
On, Blitzen! Hyah!
Merry Christmas, Roldy!
MR. PEREZ:
Where's the tree?
It's, um ...
Okay, what happened is that, um ...
You said you were going to...
...take care cf it.
Now where's the tree?
What happened to the tree is, uh...
...I kind cf burned it dawn.
That tree was a Perez...
...family tradition.
You ruined Christmas!
Ha, ha. I ruined your--?
You ruined my Christmas, man!
Heh, heh. Dc you know what happened?
Uh, I inadvertently introduced
a baby to cocaine.
I was almost burned alive
by Ukrainian gangsters.
I was drugged by...
...asshole teenagers. Then I danced
in a Christmas extravaganza.
And I'm a terrible dancer.
I almost had my dick ripped off.
And then I shot...
...Santa Claus in the fucking face.
He's real, and I shot him in the face.
Why?
Because I wanted you...
...to have a perfect
fucking Christmas.
Now, here's a newsflash:
This is my house.
Maria is my wife.
And if you want to be in our family...
...you best show me some
fucking respect.
Is that too much?
I like it.
- Really?
- Lack.
I always knew you were a nice guy.
But that's not enough
to be with my Maria.
I didn't want her to be...
...with some wimpy pussy.
But you ...
You showed me you get cojones.
Testicles, right?
Rosetta Stone.
- You know what?
- What's that?
This coming Easter...
...you guys came to my house.
That would really be great.
Thank you, Carlos.
Mr. Perez.
Mr. Perez.
KUMAR:
Fuck!
Kumar!
Jesus!
I'm sorry. I was gonna use the doorbell
but I didn't want to wake your parents.
What--? What are you doing?
You can't just--
Hold on. There's something...
...I need to say to you, okay?
When you told me you were pregnant,
I admit I was scared as shit.
The more I think about it,
the more excited I am.
I mean, I love kids.
That's because you are a kid.
I know. But ... Lack, if you
give me another chance...
...I promise you I will go back to the
medical board, I'll get my job back.
I'll even quit weed if I have to.
You'd quit weed?
Of course. I would do anything for you.
When I saw what Harold did
for his family tonight...
...it made me realize
haw important you are to me.
I wish I would've realized that sooner.
You don't have to do this.
I know I don't have to.
I want to.
Dc me a favor.
Yeah, anything.
Don't quit weed.
What?
Just remember,
next time you take a drug test...
...use my pee.
I love you.
I love you too.
Let's have some sex
before you get all fat on me.
MARIA:
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Harold! Wake up! Baby.
-It's pink.
- Oh, my God.
-It's pink.
-It's a miracle.
It's a miracle.
MR. PEREZ:
it's a miracle!
It's a miracle!
Isn't this the most beautiful tree
you've ever seen?
I came downstairs this morning...
...and here she was.
God bless us, everyone!
Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas!
