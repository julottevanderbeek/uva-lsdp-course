Oh, I'm so full.
You were right,
I shouldn't have eaten all that bread.
Want to split a dessert?
You okay? You seem a little off.
Yeah, I'm just trying to think about
what I want.
CAL:
Yeah, me too.
Why don't we just say it at the same time?
One, two, three...
- I want a divorce.
- Crème brûlée.
- You can't get away.
- Aah!
It's okay, that's my fault.
Come on, let's get you to bed
before your parents get home.
No puppy eyes, you little maniac.
Go brush your teeth.
Aren't you gonna say anything?
Almost 25 years of marriage
and you have nothing to say?
Robbie.
Hey, Robbie, have you seen
Molly's homework?
ROBBIE: Get out.
- Oh, my God.
ROBBIE: Close the door.
JESSICA: Um...
Okay, Robbie, I'm really sorry,
and I didn't see anything.
Oh, my God.
You're not talking, and you know
that only makes me talk more.
But maybe that's good, you know?
Because maybe I'll just say it.
Maybe... Maybe I'll just tell you
I slept with someone.
David Lindhagen. From work.
- You met him at the Christmas party.
- Please stop.
The last person in the world
I'd wanna hurt is you.
If you keep talking, I'm gonna get out.
I think the fact that I did it,
it just shows how broken we are.
- Okay.
- How much we really... Cal.
Oh, my God! Cal!
Are you okay?
I'll leave tonight. I'll sign whatever you want.
Just please stop talking about it.
Okay.
ROBBIE :
I'm sorry you had to see that.
No, you know, I should have knocked.
Just for the record,
I think about you while I do it.
- Robbie.
- I have this picture of you...
...and I look at it the whole time.
- Stop it.
I love you, Jessica.
I am actually begging you to stop it.
And I know you're 17,
and I know I just turned 13...
...which is the same age
as your little brother.
But soon our age difference
won't even matter.
Which is good, because I'm pretty sure
you're my soul mate.
Okay, um...
- Listen, Robbie...
EMILY: We're home.
- Shit.
- Hey.
Hey, Mr. And Mrs. Weaver, how was...?
Oh, my God. Uh, what happened?
Mrs. Weaver said she wanted a divorce,
and I jumped out of the car.
- Cal. Honey...
CAL: Well...
- Kids good? Everybody good?
ROBBIE: Dad?
EMILY: Oh.
- Oh. Hey, I didn't see you standing there.
- You're getting a divorce?
CAL: Well, yes.
Uh, so, Jess,
did Molly get through dinner okay?
Yeah, yeah, she's...
- You jumped out of a moving car?
- I jumped out of a moving car.
EMILY: Did she fight you on broccoli?
- No, she didn't.
She always fights me.
- Sorry you had to find out this way.
- Sorry you jumped out of a car.
- I'm sorry if she fought you.
- It's okay.
I don't have any money.
Uh, sweetheart? Let's go to bed, okay?
Listen, why don't you grab your coat?
I'll drive you home. All right.
I don't care. I love him. I really do.
And, given the opportunity...
Yes, I would have his babies.
Seriously? Conan O'Brien?
You would do Conan O'Brien?
Oh, my God, yes.
Ew. Friend to friend, ew.
I don't know. Your life is so PG-13.
- My life is not PG-13.
- Oh, it so is.
- No, it's not.
LIZ: Yes, it is.
You've never left L.A. You pass the bar,
you're gonna be what, a patent lawyer?
Probably married to that human Valium,
Richard. I just...
Listen, I worry about you, is all.
So much potential...
...and you've resorted to fantasizing
about Conan "Ginger Junk" O'Brien.
- He's funny.
- He looks like a carrot, honey.
JACOB:
Who looks like a carrot?
Hi. Who looks like a carrot?
Conan O'Brien.
My friend Hannah here
thinks he's sexy.
That's weird, I think that your friend
Hannah is sexy.
Oh, my God. You did not just say that.
How old are you?
- What are you, a lawyer?
- Yeah. A little bit.
JACOB: Come on.
- I know.
- You are? Is she?
- Gonna be.
Don't you think you're a little old
to use cheesy pickup lines?
- Objection. Leading the witness.
- Ha, ha.
You're wearing that
like you're doing it a favor.
- Oh, God.
- That's a line.
Me sitting there for the past two hours not
being able to take my eyes off you is fact.
I mean, there's lots of beautiful women
in this bar. Your friend included. Hi.
I love you.
But I can't take my eyes off of you.
That's a fact, it's not a line.
I find you very attractive.
Do you find me attractive?
- She does.
- I don't.
- Tsk. You do. She does.
- Yes, she does.
- I don't.
- You do.
- You do.
- I don't.
- Hannah, can I buy you a drink?
- No.
- You say no a lot, don't you?
- No.
Oh, boy. Permission
to approach the bench?
HANNAH:
Seriously?
Just, come on, let me deliver
my closing argument.
Sure. Proceed.
- Hannah, we live in a physical world, right?
HANNAH: Uh-huh.
- And you're going to age, right?
- Mm-hm.
JACOB:
I guarantee you this:
You're never gonna regret going home
with that guy from the bar that one time...
...that was a total tomcat in the sack.
But I can't guarantee
that you won't not regret it.
- That was a double negative.
- You're a double negative.
Okay. Hannah, can I buy you a drink?
Okay. You know what?
It's time to go home.
JACOB: Really?
- Mm-hm.
JACOB:
That's forward of you, but okay. I'll do it.
HANNAH:
I TiVoed .
So should I get my car or yours?
Should I pull the car around?
You been drinking? I'll drive.
- Liz?
LIZ: Coming.
- I'll have to call Nanna.
- Huh?
Oh. Noth...
So Stanford, huh?
Good for you. That's great.
I know your dad's really proud.
Yeah. Yeah, he's...
- Are you sure you're okay?
- David Lindhagen, God.
Okay.
CAL:
I'm sorry. Sorry about that.
It's okay.
Um...
- Mr. Weaver?
- Hmm?
Um...
You're the nicest dad that I babysit...
Of all the, um...
You're really nice.
- That's very nice.
- And, um...
...I like Ms. Weaver,
I like her a lot. Okay?
But if she wants to divorce you...
...then I think she's batshit crazy.
Mm.
- Sorry.
- Okay. Okay.
I hope this doesn't make you
uncomfortable.
- I've developed, like, a little crush...
- Could you do me a favor?
Would you not mention to your parents
that Mrs. Weaver and I are, you know...
It's something we wanna tell them
on our own, okay?
Yeah.
Thank you, I appreciate that.
Have a good night.
BARTENDER:
Another vodka cranberry?
I'm sorry. What?
BARTENDER: Another vodka cranberry?
- Oh, yeah. Yes, thanks.
I've been by this place
a million times, never come in.
It's nice, lot of pretty girls.
- Hey, guess what.
- What?
My wife is having intercourse
with someone who is not me.
Um, I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh. Thank you. That is very nice
of you to say. Very, very nice.
She just told me.
I just found out, so I'm a little raw. It's...
Ah, okay. Well, you're not listening.
Okay.
You wouldn't ignore me
if I were David Lindhagen.
My wife doesn't ignore David Lindhagen.
She screws him.
Screws him.
They make this, like, gurgling sound,
it's like:
Gay.
- Hey, Cal.
CAL: Hey.
BOSS:
Hey.
Oh, I just, uh... I got the report
on the end-of-year financials.
- Good. Good, good. Really great.
- Oh, good.
You killed this quarter.
Okay.
BOSS: Cal, seriously.
- All right.
- Okay.
BOSS: Seriously.
Who told you
that Emily and I are getting divorced?
- You're getting a divorce?
- Yeah.
Amy heard you crying in the bathroom.
We all thought it was cancer.
- Oh.
- Thank God, man. Ha-ha-ha.
Yeah, just my relationship.
- Thank God.
- Oh...
Divorce.
- I'm so lucky.
- You are.
- I have to go pick out furniture now.
BOSS: Okay, okay. You go for it.
It could have been cancer, buddy.
Hey, everyone, it's just a divorce.
MAN:
All right, buddy.
Thanks. Feels good.
Cal? I just wanted to say...
Shit.
Can I back that thing
out of the driveway for you?
- Oh, no. I'll be fine.
- You have trouble in reverse, is all.
When I get settled, the kids can come
and take a look at my new place.
I think I'm having a midlife crisis,
maybe.
Can women have midlife crises?
In the movies it's always men having them
and buying ridiculous yellow Porsches...
...but, you know, I'm not a man.
Be sure to fertilize all this.
We got married so young, Cal.
And now I'm 44.
And it's so much older
than I thought I'd be.
There's a turnoff valve
for the sprinklers over there.
Last week, when I told you
that I had to work late...
...I went to see the new  movie
by myself.
I don't know why I did that.
And it was so bad, Cal.
It keeps raining, you might
wanna turn off the automatic setting.
And we haven't been us.
Not for a long time.
And I don't know when you and I
stopped being us.
I mean, do you?
Maybe it's when
you screwed David Lindhagen.
Hey.
Sorry I'm late,
I had to pick something up at Macy's.
CAL: Oh. Don't even worry about it.
- A chardonnay.
I'm just glad you're here.
Wow.
I don't know. I don't know what happened.
Tough couple of days.
You know
when you don't see something coming...
Claire said I can't be friends
with you anymore.
What?
She said we had to choose
between you and Emily.
I chose you.
But she said no.
It's cologne.
Bernie?
- Are you breaking up with me, Bernie?
- There's a gift receipt in there also.
CAL:
Bernie?
Bernie. Bernie.
CAL: You know a word
that is not used very often anymore?
"Cuckold."
I'm a cuckold.
David Lindhagen cuckolded me.
He made a cuckold out of me.
He slept with my wife.
And I didn't know about it.
And that is the definition of cuckoldom.
David Lindhagen took my wife
and slept with her.
Thought I did everything right.
Got married, had kids, the house.
What do I get for it? I get cuckolded.
David Lindhagen cuckolded me.
He made a cuckold out of me.
Can you give me five minutes?
Interesting.
Hey. Jacob Palmer.
- Cal Weaver.
- Let me buy you a drink, Cal.
- Thanks, I have a drink.
- Sit. I'd like to buy you a drink.
Okay.
Guess what.
- My wife is having an affair with...
- David Lindhagen.
David Lindhagen. I know.
- How do I know that?
- I don't know.
I'm a total stranger. How would I know
something so intimate?
- Lindhagen screwing with your wife too?
JACOB: No.
- Hmm.
JACOB: You wanna know why I know that?
Okay.
It's all that I've heard, Cal, for the past
two nights. It's all anybody's heard.
You're going around and you're badgering
people with this sad-sack loser sob story.
- I don't understand why.
- I don't need this crap.
- Cal, sit down.
- All right.
Look, I know that it sounds harsh,
but it's true.
And you need to hear the truth. Okay?
Okay.
Cal, would you take that straw
out of your mouth? Please.
That looks like
you're sucking on a tiny .
Is that what you want?
Is that the message you wanna send?
- No one's thinking that.
JACOB: Really?
- So permission to speak candidly, sir.
- Uh, think you've already gone there.
You're sitting there
with a Supercuts haircut...
...getting drunk on watered-down
vodka cranberries like a 14-year-old girl...
...and you're wearing a 44
when you should be wearing a 42 regular.
Honestly, I don't know if I should
help you or euthanize you.
Cal, you got a kind face.
You got a good head of hair.
You seem like a nice guy.
I wanna help you. I'm gonna help you
rediscover your manhood.
Do you have any idea,
like, where you lost it?
- A strong case could be made for 1984.
JACOB: Well.
We're gonna find it.
We are. I promise you.
And I promise you this too, Cal:
When we're done...
...this wife of yours...
...she's gonna rue the day
she ever decided to give up on you.
That's my offer.
You in or you out?
Why are you doing this?
Maybe you remind me of someone.
You in or you out?
I'm in.
Hey, fancy face, you wanna go?
Okay.
Century City Mall, food court,
After you, hon.
Good night, fancy face.
She will rue the day.
Set you guys up with some snacks
over here. TV's already on.
You okay?
Mm. Yeah. You?
Mm.
Can I tell you something?
Love sucks.
CAL:
Yeah.
You in love, buddy?
ROBBIE: Well, if you must know...
- Ding-dong.
- Oh, hey, Jess. Thanks for coming by.
- Hey. Yeah.
What is she doing here?
Guys, I have to step out for a couple
of minutes. Okay? All right? Okay.
Mom wants you to stay
while she's out hooking.
- What?
CAL: What?
Oh. Um, the place is nice, Mr. Weaver.
Thanks.
That's a very generous adjective.
- Honey.
ROBBIE: I don't need a babysitter.
She's only four years older.
You need to know that.
- She needs to know that.
- I know, I know, I know.
Man, are you growing up.
Look at him. It's unbelievable.
He's in love already.
Oh.
Molly. Say bye to Daddy.
- Wait, where are you going?
- I'm taking a class.
- That is great, Mr. Weaver.
- Thank you.
This is a difficult time for you, right?
And it's important to try new things.
Even things that you haven't
considered trying before.
Mm-hm. Yup. Molly, I'm going.
Okay. That's my princess. Bye. Thanks.
- But wait. Dad.
CAL: Bye, guys. See you in a bit.
Hey, Tiger.
- I love you so, so much.
- Jeez, Robbie.
I love you so much. Please?
What the hell am I doing?
What am I doing?
MAN:
Hey, uh, everybody.
Everybody. Uh, if I could...
Thank you. A little toast.
I would like to thank you all for coming
to Hannah Banana's goodbye party.
And to my...
- ... Hannah Banana.
ALL: Ha, ha.
You go into your cave
and you study your butt off.
Because if you do, I just know
that you are gonna kick that bar's butt...
...out of here. You know?
- Yeah.
It reminds me of an old story
my law professor told me...
Oh, dear God. Cheers, everyone.
ALL:
Cheers.
RICHARD:
Hey, Liz.
Listen, when my girl here passes...
...I'm gonna have another
little celebration right here...
...and I hope you can make it,
because it's gonna be a special night.
Okay.
- Did you hear that?
LIZ: Hear what?
- You heard that? "Special night"?
LIZ: Yeah. Yeah.
You think he's gonna propose?
At the El Torito Grill? God, I hope not.
Why, do you want him to?
I don't know, he's nice.
"He's ni..."? Hannah.
He's a sweetheart. Look at him.
- He bcc'd you?
- Right, yeah.
All right. Hannah, look at you.
Look at you.
If you end up with that,
what am I gonna end up with?
- Shut up. Come on.
- That shit's depressing.
All right. You know what?
I have to not big-sister you. It's fine if...
Jesus, really?
No. No. Not my life. Not my life.
I'm going. Okay?
So call me if you need anything. Bye.
You're awful. Bye.
Thank you for coming.
CAL:
Um...
- You're late.
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Sbarro's?
- No, thanks.
Let me ask a question.
How much you got for clothes?
Um...
- What happened to your feet?
- What do you mean?
- These are my 407 s.
- Oh, they're 407 s.
- Can I see them?
- Yeah.
- These offer a lot of support.
- Right.
CAL:
Whoa. Come on.
- What, are you in a fraternity?
- Are you insane?
You could have hit somebody.
What was that?
- I'm asking a question. You in a frat?
- No.
- Are you Steve Jobs?
- What?
Hold on a second. Are you the billionaire
owner of Apple Computers?
- No.
JACOB: Oh.
Okay. Well, in that case, you got no right
to wear New Balance sneakers ever.
- Come on.
- Mm... Oh...
Okay. All right.
JACOB: One of the best parts
about being a guy your age...
Frankly, there aren't many, so you
should really take full advantage of it.
Uh-huh.
- Is that you can rebuild your entire
wardrobe with like 16 items.
Credit card.
What?
You see, the problem
is that your head has like...
Like the proportions
of a Styrofoam peanut.
The skin under your eyes is starting
to look like Hugh Hefner's ball sac.
It does.
Where are your wallets?
- I'm set for jeans.
- You're not set for jeans.
- These are fine.
JACOB: They're not fine.
- You have a mom butt.
- Why don't we just go to the Gap?
You know what? They have a s... Okay.
What are you doing?
Cal, be better than the Gap.
Be better than the Gap.
Say it.
I'm better than the Gap.
- Come on.
- God.
- Stop slapping me. Really.
JACOB: Okay.
You're beautiful.
He likes to slap me in the face.
- What are you doing later?
- Ha, ha. I don't know.
- I do.
- Do you?
- I know exactly what you're doing.
- Oh, ha, ha.
CAL:
Seriously? Seriously?
- You ask her out like that?
- Yeah.
And that worked?
BOTH:
Yeah.
Feeling kind of stupid, but...
TIFFANY:
Wow.
Look at you.
Feel like I'm going skiing.
- Would you sleep with him?
- Jesus. God.
- Yeah, probably.
- Wha...?
You would?
That's... What?
What are you even saying?
You see what just happened, Cal?
Soon as you opened your mouth, Tiffany
started doubting whether she wanted to.
That's the meanest thing
anyone's ever said to me.
No. This is.
Your wife cheated on you because
you lost sight of who you are as a man...
...as a husband, and probably as a lover.
You're right, that's meaner.
Let's talk about how many women
you've been with.
- Sexually?
- Yeah, no. I mean break-dance fighting.
One.
No. Not at one time.
How many total?
Don't say it. Don't say it.
We met in high school, okay?
Oh, boy. You're kidding me.
One woman? That's great.
- Emily is beautiful.
- I guess.
She was gorgeous.
She was one of those women...
...that could be wildly sexy
and unbelievably cute all at the same time.
We had a little blip senior year...
I literally stopped listening at "Emily."
I think we should start approaching
women tonight.
Are you ready to go?
I miss my wife.
JACOB: Hi.
AMY: Hi.
JACOB: How are you?
- Good. How are you?
I'm great. I'm Jacob. What's your name?
- Oh. Amy Johnson.
- Amy Johnson.
- I'm Jacob Palmer. How you doing?
- Uh, great.
JACOB: Good.
- I'm Cal.
JACOB:
No. Not yet.
- Sorry. Amy, can I buy you a drink?
- Uh-huh.
Keep her company?
- I'd be happy to.
- If he gets handsy, let me know.
I wouldn't touch you
if my life depended on it.
- Uh, what was your name?
- Cal Weaver.
AMY: Cal Weaver.
- No relation to Dennis Weaver.
- Uh... Uh...
- .
was a show in the '70s
that...
You're not talking about
again, are you?
Here we go, huh?
To all of our fallen homeys.
Well, I'm the fourth of five sisters.
- No. That's boring.
- Oh.
Not for your sisters,
but for my purposes, it's not gonna work.
- Okay.
- I have this friend.
And he thinks that you're way too pretty
to be interesting and that's hogwash.
- All right. You wanna get out of here?
- Uh, sure.
Giddyup.
Am I boring you? I'm totally boring you.
I'm...
How are you doing this, like...
...wildly sexy but unbelievably cute
thing that you're doing?
JORDYN: Uh...
- It's weird.
- You wanna get out of here?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
JORDYN: Cool.
So Molly, who's 6 at the time,
can't find Mr. Bobo.
We're looking all over.
It's in the kitchen.
Mr. Bobo was in the kitchen the whole time.
Wanna get out of here?
Have a good night.
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.
- Let's get out of here.
WOMEN: Absolutely.
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.
Shit.
- You have a second?
- Hey, David. No. Because I'm swamped.
DAVID: You've been avoiding me.
- No. I haven't.
You ran in the other direction when you
saw me coming down the hall yesterday.
- You're very fast, by the way.
- I ran track in high school.
That must be it.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry
about you and Cal.
- No, you're not.
- No, I'm not.
I like you, Emily.
Do you have any idea
how much I like you?
Hey, David, you know,
I really have a lot to do.
I had no intention of falling
for a married woman...
...but all of a sudden we're having
lunch and I'm this accountant...
...who's waking up every morning
excited to go to work.
And that just does not happen
for accountants. Ever.
I checked with other accountants.
David, you know what?
You've been a great friend.
You noticed last month when I got
my hair trimmed and that was huge.
But look, trust me. You know...
I am saving you from disaster, because
you're asking to pre-board the .
Do you really want any part of this?
Do I really want any part of this?
- Emily? Your report's ready.
- Okay.
TEACHER:
Okay, people. Here it is.
by Nathaniel Hawthorne.
A romance set in Salem in the 1600s.
It is about sin.
TEACHER: Forced to wear the scarlet A
to punish her adulterous behavior.
Dimmesdale's A is inflicted upon himself
in the form of a...
Mr. Weaver.
Mr. Weaver.
Are we interrupting?
You wanna talk about
, Ms. Tafferty?
All right.
Well, the A they're both wearing...
...I think it stands for "asshole."
Wanna know why?
Because they fell in love...
...and love is for stupid assholes.
And this book is just about
a bunch of assholes...
...who fell in love, like assholes...
...then had to die, like assholes.
I'm sorry about all the "assholes."
You know what else might work?
A swear jar.
You know, a quarter per curse word.
EMILY:
Yeah, we'll definitely try that.
All right. Could help.
- Take care.
- Thanks.
- Seriously?
- Sorry.
Hey, I have to go back to the office.
You're gonna have to wait for me there.
ROBBIE:
Fine.
They're still making kids read
, huh?
Yep.
You'd think somebody would have
written something better by now.
I guess I should take that down, huh?
I guess.
So how is he? You know.
I mean, l...
Oh, no. I'm sorry. Forget it. Just ignore me.
- Forget I ever...
- He's out a lot.
- A lot?
- Yeah.
Like...
Like "a lot" a lot,
or just like a little?
A lot.
Well, that's good. That's really good.
- Wanna get takeout tonight, honey?
- I mean, he's sad.
I can tell that he's sad.
Even though he looks better...
...I can still tell that he's not happy,
you know?
Yeah. Well, you know. Yeah.
I guess I'm pretty sad too.
I know.
I heard you crying the other night.
Didn't know what to do.
Oh, Robbie, baby, you're 13,
you're not supposed to know what to do.
I tried Googling it.
- You did not.
- Yep. I did.
- Well, what did you Google?
- I searched "Mom crying in bed."
What did Google say?
Just a bunch of weird videos
of moms in bed.
Ugh. Oh, God. Okay.
All right, that's enough. No more.
Do those parental controls work at all?
They work for me.
Because you're a disgusting teenager,
that's why.
DAVID: Hey.
- Oh, hey.
- Bill wants to see you before you take off.
- Oh. Uh, David, this is my son, Robbie.
Robbie, this is David.
- Um, we work together.
- How you doing, buddy?
- You all right to wait a little bit?
- Yeah.
EMILY:
Okay. Thanks, David.
So, Robbie, I hear
you're quite the soccer player.
So, David, I hear
you broke up my parents' marriage.
- You are David Lindhagen, right?
- Lindhagen.
- Yeah. Here's the thing, Lindhagen.
- Hagen.
Whatever.
In the end, she winds up
back with my dad.
He's a better guy than you are
in every category.
And she still loves him.
He's not gonna give up on my mom...
...like I'm not gonna stop
sending Jessica messages...
...that make her feel uncomfortable.
Hey. You ready to go, honey?
- Can we order Chinese for dinner tonight?
EMILY: Yeah. Sure, honey.
Hi, David. Get your stuff.
- Bye, David.
DAVID: See you.
You're not gonna be able
to feel your arms.
I'll be fine.
Jesus Christ.
JACOB:
Look, let's face it, Cal, all right?
The war between the sexes is over,
and we won, okay?
We won the second women started doing
pole dancing for exercise.
But even though we won,
they still deserve our respect.
Make them feel beautiful, listen to
their problems, open the door for them.
Would you put on some clothes, please?
- I'm sorry, is this bothering you?
- No, it's not.
My  is in your face.
If it's not bothering you, we got a problem.
- Okay, it bothers me.
- I don't care.
You gotta take control
of your manhood, pal. You know?
You want something, you take it.
You don't like something, you say it.
I take what I want.
David Lindhagen certainly took
what he wanted, didn't he?
And I can guarantee you this:
He is opening the car door
for your wife right now.
What, you passing out?
Oh, boy.
- I think you're ready, pal.
- For what?
To talk to a pretty lady,
and take her home and show her your gift.
No. No, I'm not.
You're ready as you're ever gonna be.
You play your strengths, pal.
That's all any of us can do.
I'm mysterious.
I'm, you know, good in bed.
And you are a, uh...
...you know, stable and employed adult.
Jesus.
You see this lady over here at 9 o'clock?
CAL:
You want me to hit on her?
No, I wanna hit on her.
The one behind her.
CAL:
Oh.
JACOB: She's a fox, right?
CAL: Mm-hm.
You think she came to a crowded bar
to have a quiet drink alone? She's hunting.
She's just looking for an opportunity
to settle for a responsible and stable adult.
And I'd like her to settle for you.
Oh. Well, thank you for the ego boost,
but you know what?
Just because I've watched you
pick up women...
...doesn't mean I know how
to pick up women.
- Ever see
- What does that have to do with anything?
When he's teaching him to wax on and off
but really to fight?
You want me to fight someone?
What's the first thing I do
when I go up to a girl? I buy her a drink.
Yes, always. Without fail.
You buy her a drink.
Even if she doesn't want one,
you insist.
- And do I talk about myself?
- Never.
Never about yourself, always her.
- Because bar banter...?
- Is boring.
So you put the impetus on her.
She has to be the interesting one.
"Impress me.
Impress me with how interesting you are."
It's a big game. Game.
Creepy, creepy little game you play.
- That's judgmental, isn't it?
- Mm-hm.
At the end of the night
do I ask them to come home?
No, you tell them to come home.
They have no choice in the matter.
It is your choice and they are so overjoyed
to have had the opportunity...
...to make sweet, sweet love to you.
Oh, my God.
You did, you Miyagi'd me.
Honk.
Take your ring off. Let's go.
Just no talking about your kids, your job,
David Lindhagen, don't you dare.
Shut up, shut up. Just shut up.
- Hello.
JACOB: Hi.
Hi. Hi.
- Who are you?
- Hey. I'm Kate.
- Kate, you mind if I introduce you to my...?
- I'm Cal.
- I got this. Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.
And this is my friend Jacob.
He was just leaving.
- Oh.
- Oh.
So that's one way to treat people.
So can I buy you a drink, Kate?
- Oh. No, thank you.
- I'm gonna buy you a drink anyway.
Grey Goose, right?
Rocks. Two limes?
I'm five years sober.
- What can I get for you?
- Nothing. Nothing.
Go away, we're good.
Please don't come back ever.
- Ahem. So, what do you do, Cal?
- I don't know. What do you do, Kate?
- I asked you first.
- I asked you second.
Seriously, what do you do?
Seriously, what do you do?
Are you really not going to tell me
what you do?
Ah...
- Uh, okay, I'm a teacher.
- Boring.
Come on, you gotta keep it interesting.
Interest me.
Uh...
- I studied at Oxford for five years.
- Boring!
Wow. Teacher with an alcohol dependency
who studied at Oxford.
Blah, blah, blah. Bleh.
England. Yuck.
I think my friends just got here.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Okay, I'm in corporate insurance.
- Oh, God.
I have children, plural.
My wife was cheating on me
with Lindhagen...
...which I wasn't supposed to tell you.
Nice to meet you.
- What were you supposed to tell me?
- I don't know. I don't know.
I was supposed to say that you are the
perfect combination of sexy and cute...
...which is actually something
that I used to say to my wife.
But now it's become corrupted.
And I have 18 layers of clothes on.
I'm wearing a shirt and a tie
and a sweater and a suede jacket...
...that just seals in all the heat.
Seals in all the juices.
It's all sweat under here.
This is just sweat from here down.
This sweater, this is called slim cut,
but it feels like a scuba suit.
And I'm looking at your breasts.
What's that about?
You think I'm the perfect combination
of sexy and cute?
That's what you picked up
from what I just said?
Mm, mm.
- So this is my crappy apartment.
- Oh. Ooh.
Dumpy. That I had to move into
after my wife left me.
I love how you're being so honest.
- You like that?
- It's so different. It's so hot.
Okay. Okay.
KATE: Aah! Ha, ha.
- Wow! Wow!
- More.
- Okay.
CAL: Wanna hear something really hot?
- Mm-hm.
I've only had sex with one woman.
In my entire life.
- Honest or not honest?
- That's honest.
More! Tell me more.
I'm a little worried you have AIDS.
Just a little. Just a little bit.
It's okay, I'm not worried.
Oh, my God, this is so much fun.
What do you wanna do with me?
Oh...
I wanna show you off to my ex-wife
and make her really jealous.
CAL:
Whoa, man.
Phew. Ha, ha.
You gonna call me?
Okay.
Yeah.
Wow, that is a great dress.
Where'd you get that?
Thank you. A store in Beverly Hills.
CAL:
Really? Beautiful.
WOMAN:
It was a gift from my grandmother.
- Really?
WOMAN: It's a Krugerrand.
It's from South Africa.
I love it.
And I told him never to assume
anything.
And I've been to Maine, so that's a
sixth state. So I've been to six states.
- Oh, I love Maine.
SOPHIA: Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.
- Have you been to Waterville?
- I have, yeah.
Greece, Italy.
Greece, Italy?
Wanna get out of here?
- You're driving.
- I am.
I have never experienced that
in my life.
- Pretty great.
- Are most women like that these days?
- God bless technology.
- God bless it.
I went and met this girl the other night.
She was heckling me the whole time we...
I felt like I was doing it with the two
old guys from .
- Ha-ha-ha. Statler and Waldorf.
JACOB: I was into it.
And she was like, "Look at this frown
on your face. What is that?
You're so serious. What, it's serious
to kiss me? It's supposed to be fun.
Oh, my God, if it's gonna be hard work,
why don't you just stop?"
HANNAH :
Hey. Hot guy from the bar
who hit on you is here.
Tsk. Liz, I'm studying.
You should be studying the ceiling
of his bedroom.
In what world, honey?
Please, turn around. No.
Come on, take a break.
It'll be good for you to get out.
And by get out...
...I mean have hot guy from the bar knock
you into his headboard until you see God.
What is wrong with you?
You should be studying the curve
of his...
Okay, goodbye, Liz.
That too much? Hello?
BERNIE: Look, I gave him the cologne
like you told me to...
...and I don't think we should really
just dance on his grave.
WOMAN: I just thought you'd wanna know
what I heard about your old pal Cal.
What about Mr. Weaver, Mom?
Um, just, apparently, Mr. Weaver
has become a real ladies' man.
- What?
- Claire.
CLAIRE:
She should know. She babysits for him.
She's almost an adult. Lots of young
women in and out of his apartment.
BERNIE:
She's too young for this.
I don't like this S-E-X talk in front
of the K-l-D-S.
CLAIRE: First of all, they can spell.
Second of all, I'm just saying.
I think we were right in choosing Emily.
JESSICA: Oh, um...
- Why are you following me?
Madison, I just had a question for you.
Okay, Jessica, what's up?
It's kind of on the personal side.
Yep, my lips are:
Seals. My lips are seals.
Okay. Um...
My question, and I don't mean to be blunt
or insulting, but let's just call it what it is.
You're always sleeping
with older guys, right?
- Always.
JESSICA: Oh, um...
So my question for you, Madison,
is, um, how do you do that?
I mean, how do you get them to see you
as not just a kid in high school, you know?
But as someone that's mature,
and old, and that's...
Well, first off, I have a huge rack.
Uh, yes, you do.
You don't have a huge rack.
No.
- Wait, how old is he?
- Old.
MADISON:
Like really old?
- Like parent-old.
- Nasty, Jessica.
Yeah, because
that's what I was thinking, right?
MADISON: Rock on.
- Thank you.
MADISON: You are so dirty.
- Yes, I know.
Oh, okay. You gotta force his hand.
You know what I mean?
Go TMZ on his ass.
- Not following.
- A dirty picture.
- Oh. Oh.
- Make this face:
- Jeez, Madison. Stop.
MADISON: What?
You put that on his radar and he won't see
you as a little girl anymore, that's for sure.
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey. We don't know.
ROBBIE:
Behold.
Jessica Riley, you are my soul mate.
- The love of my life.
STUDENTS: Ha-ha-ha.
I have marked myself with a scarlet J
for you, Jessica.
Get down from there.
ROBBIE: Nathaniel Hawthorne... Are you mad?
- I am your babysitter. You get down.
Oh, my God.
- What are you thinking?
- Like the scaffold?
Took me like four weeks to make it.
It has wheels.
JESSICA:
This has got to stop, Robbie.
- You'll learn to love me, I promise.
- No, I won't.
- Because I'm four years younger?
- Because I love somebody else.
Who is he?
He's older.
And I didn't want my parents to find out.
You know I'll kill him if he hurts you.
Yeah, I know.
Okay, Robbie, this has to stop.
Okay? No more.
Grow up.
I'll see you around.
CAL:
Unh. Okay.
Okay.
So you're seeing Mom tomorrow
at my parent-teacher thing.
Yeah, no biggie.
What's with all the moping?
Uh, nothing. It's just...
There's a girl.
- A girl, huh?
- Uh-huh.
You like her?
I like Pringles.
I mean, this girl...
...she's incredible.
She's my soul mate, you know?
She doesn't even care.
But she's your soul mate, right?
Yeah.
Well, you just don't give up on her,
right?
Why not? You did.
I didn't give up.
Okay, it's more complicated than that.
I'm a different guy now.
You're not different.
You just have different clothes.
It's not that simple, kiddo.
- What kind of crap is that?
- Watch it.
You love her or you don't. I know you do.
I'm serious, Dad. I just need some
inspiration right now. All right?
Go get her back.
Wow, how old are you?
EMILY:
Wow.
You look great, Cal.
Oh. Ha, ha.
Well, it turns out I've been buying
the wrong size suit for like 20 years, so...
Oh, well, whatever.
You, um... You look great.
Thanks. You always look great.
Oh, thanks.
- So I spoke to Nanna yesterday.
- Yeah, me too. How'd she sound to you?
Um... Like Nanna. She worries about us.
What teacher is this?
Ms. Tafferty. She's the one he pulled
the  asshole routine on.
Mm-hm.
God, he's such a weird kid.
- I kind of like him, though.
- Mm-hm.
Yeah, me too.
Glad we switched babies at the hospital.
Me too. That other one's in jail, probably.
So how's it going with David?
Oh, you know, it, um...
It wasn't, um...
That didn't mean anything.
- I mean, you know, if...
- No. No, I know.
You seeing anybody?
Me?
Mm-mm.
Oh, you know. Well, you hear things,
you know, so...
No. No. Not real...
You know me.
Yeah, well...
No.
I miss you, Em.
I made an effort when we were younger,
didn't I?
I mean, miniature golf and dancing.
You were such a great dancer.
I had to be.
You were such a good miniature golfer.
I just... I don't know. I guess I got lazy.
I got...
I got boring, is what I got.
No.
And I'm so mad at you.
I'm really mad at you for what you did.
But I'm mad at myself too.
Because I should not have jumped
out of that car. I should've fought for you.
Because you fight for your soul mates.
Least, that's what my 13-year-old son
tells me.
He's a really strange kid.
He scares the shit out of me.
I miss you too.
Mr. And Mrs. Weaver?
No way in hell.
- Cal, what are you doing here?
- Oh, you two know each other?
Yes. Yeah, right. We've met before, yes.
- "We have met before"? Seriously?
CAL: Mm-hm.
So I'd like to introduce you
to my wife, Emily.
Hi, I'm Robbie's mom.
She's your wife again. How convenient.
So shall we enter?
- Okay.
- Why don't we?
CAL:
Yeah, let's do that.
I'm sorry. I'm playing catch-up.
How do you two know each other, exactly?
- Um...
- Um...
Maybe your husband should tell you.
We... I think we met at last year's
parent-teacher conference, wasn't it?
Did I miss it? Did I miss the parent-teacher
conference thing last year?
Yeah. I don't remember.
Why don't we just, uh, focus on Robbie?
KATE:
Yes.
Yes, let's do that. Let's...
Let's focus on Robbie.
As you know,
Robbie's shining moment...
...was when he set a school record for
cursing in an eighth-grade English class.
Asshole. Ha-ha-ha.
You're familiar with this word,
Mrs. Weaver.
Yes, I am. And I've spoken to Principal...
Asshole. As in someone who tells
a woman that he'll call and never does.
