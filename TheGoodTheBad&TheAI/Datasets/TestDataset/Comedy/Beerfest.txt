You've got spunk, Wolfhouse.
I'll give you that.
I don't got room in my
pocket for more of your money.
I got a little spunk for you.
You couldn't hit your own ball bag
with your own wrinkled cock.
Chance.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
You play rim rules?
Doesn't everybody?
Yeah, the shit-stabbers like you.
Hold on there, girlfriend.
You're gonna chance...
...you're gonna have to earn it.
Oh, no. No way.
Forget about it.
I'm out of here. Where's my...?
Hey. You said you wanted to chance,
now take a chance.
All right, all right.
Son of a bitch!
Up yours, Johnny Cash.
Okay. Grab him, boys.
You weren't trying to play me for
a fool, were you, Wolfhouse?
Beginner's luck.
You don't come into my place of business
and take my money like that.
Now, what I should do is
beat seven shades of shit out of you.
- But I'll teach you something somebody...
- Hey!
What's going on down here?
Todd, welcome home!
I'm just having some fun with your
younger, dumber brother.
Might not be the best time.
Everyone's waiting.
Oh, of course.
Padre?
I'll come back for the rest.
Great Gam Gam. I'm so sorry.
My friends...
...as we gather today to mourn
the passing of Johan Wolfhouse...
...what can I say that
Johan can't say for himself?
The Young and the Restless.
- He loved that show.
-
- Hey. It's Popo.
-
For hundreds of years,
it has been a Wolfhouse tradition...
...to spread the ashes of
our loved ones in Munich.
I am too old.
I want you boys to go to Germany...
...and carry out this tradition
for your grandfather.
Sure, it would be an honor for us,
Great Gam Gam. When?
Well, you must leave immediately.
The tradition is to spread the ashes...
...during the festival
on the Theresienwiese.
There you will meet
a Mr. Schniedelwichsen.
He will take you to
the family resting place.
The festival begins this week.
The festival of the what-what?
Oh, boys, you know this festival
as Oktoberfest.
We're in.
We really gotta find this Schniedelwichsen
and spread Grandpa's ashes.
He's supposed to meet us here.
So there's nothing we can do
but hang out and wait. Right, Grandpa?
Come on, guys.
Are you making fun of us, mate?
What? No.
We're singing the beloved
drinking songs of our country...
...and you sing us
that bloody jingo jango?
I reckon you're taking
the piss out of Oktoberfest.
We're just singing.
What do you think, mate?
I think we should fucking brain them.
Hey, we love Oktober...
Hot cheese soup!
Hot cheese so...!
Come on.
This is the
Just kiss each other,
Helmut, my God, are you okay?
Oh, strewth. They hit the little kid!
Let's get the bastards!
So this is Oktoberfest.
Wolfhouse?
Yeah.
I am Mr. Schniedelwichsen.
- Hi!
- Let's go.
Gam Gam said you'd meet us here.
There's some crazy...
- Gotcha.
- Hey!
- He's got me!
- He's gone crazy dingo.
Make fast! Make very fast!
Split! Split!
Where are we going,
Mr. Spiedelspackel?
Schniedelwichsen. Come.
Halt. See, we're here.
Johan?
The ashes.
We left them back at that tent.
We gotta go get our grandfather's ashes.
Come. Come now.
We in the right neighborhood?
Oh, hello, blondie.
You care for a dance?
Jan? Jan?
Leave my brother alone.
I miss you!
The password!
They're playing Quarters!
Hey, Beer Pong!
Upside-down Chugs!
Come! Come in here.
I'd bugger her
for a game of soldiers, huh?
Hello. Pim Scutney.
This here's me mate, Rog Gobshire.
Team England.
I am Jan Wolfhouse and
this is my brother, Todd Wolfhouse.
And what is this?
Beerfest, innit!
Is this part of Oktoberfest?
Oktoberfest is for tossers and
sheep-shaggers.
Beerfest is our lives.
The ultimate test of
a beer-gamer's mettle!
- Where's the American team?
- Yeah.
- That's worth a squirt, innit?
- What?
Excuse me, guys.
Please vomit in proper receptacles!
Wait a second.
Look at those urns over there.
They look just like Grandpa's.
That's why Schniedelwasher
brought us here.
We're supposed to put Grandpa's urn
up there with those.
We gotta go back and get it.
You go. I'm never leaving this place.
Hello, guvnor!
We got ourselves a tie.
You see them blokes in the knickers?
That's the German team, the champs.
Their family owns
the oldest brewery in Bavaria.
They're regular diamond geezers,
they are, right?
Why does the last guy
chug out of a shoe?
That's no shoe!
That's Das Boot!
And she's a cruel old mistress, she is.
Drink up, Hansel!
Wow, they're fast!
Das Boot!
Schniedelspanker!
Von Wolfhausen. Wolfhouse.
Your last name's von Wolfhausen?
Get the fuck out of here. So is ours!
Wolfhouse.
We're cousins?
Oh, this just gets better and better!
We must be related through
our grandfather, Johan von Wolfhausen.
Why are you taking him?
Where's he going?
We kind of need to stick close.
- He is of no concern to you.
- But he was just walking us through. He...
You do not speak of Beerfest
outside of Beerfest!
You do not bring outsiders to Beerfest.
But our grandfather
was Johan von Wolf...
Your grandfather
was no von Wolfhausen.
Your grandfather was a thieving
bastard stable boy.
- What did you say?
- Baron Ludwig von Wolfhausen...
...our great-grandfather, the most
legendary  in all Deutschland.
He perfected the von Wolfhausen
beer recipe.
It was the greatest beer in all the world.
When Ludwig died, your grandfather stole
the only copy of the recipe created.
Hold on a second.
Our grandfather didn't brew beer.
He had this little sausage house
in Colorado. He couldn't...
He could  he did.
He stole our recipe  fled Germany
with his mother...
...a common Bavarian...
What's the English word I'm looking for?
Whore.
Gam Gam a whore?
Obviously there's
a translation problem here.
Hooker. Prostitute. Slut for money.
- Now you're crossing the line.
- No, you are crossing the line! He stole it!
now, instead of having Deutschland's
greatest beer, we merely have fourth-best.
we are not your cousins.
You are the offspring of the bastard son
of some whore!
- Don't call Gam Gam a whore! She's not!
- Punch me! Do it!
you big tough guy.
Kill me, come on.
Do it now! Kill me.
What are you waiting for?
Typical Americans. This is why
we don't allow you in our Beerfest.
You get a few drinks in you
you become the Dirty Harry.
You should go back to your strip malls
and drink your Zimas and Smirnoff Ices.
then you can punch each other silly.
Okay. Okay.
Okay. Sounds like you guys
fancy yourselves drinkers, huh?
maybe a little.
I think we just beat the Irish, so...
- Oh, that's good. The champions. What?
- Well, I'll tell you what.
Why don't you pick your best two?
Because you just opened up a can of corn.
Corn.
We are laughing.
We are laughing at you.
- Our best two? You want our best two?
- The corn.
How about our worst two, right?
Hammacher! Schlemmer!
You take the big guy.
I'll get the little one.
You ready,
Everyone at once.
First team to finish wins. On my word.
- Let's do this.
-  do it.
Hey, boys, why don't you let us
put a nipple on that for you?
I remember my first beer.
Prosit.
Allow me to introduce our grandfather:
Wolfgang von Wolfhausen.
Take a good look...
...for this is a real von Wolfhausen.
Grandpapa.
Oh, shit.
So you are the progeny of Johan.
I am guessing that he is the one
who taught you how to drink beer.
Now...
...where is our recipe?
What fucking recipe?
Friends...
...this is all that remains
of a thieving stable boy...
...who ran away to America
with his whore mother!
I'm a sucker for family reunions.
Here are a couple of euros.
Go back and get a BJ
from your great-grandma, on me.
Now get out of here.
They called Grandpa a thief
and Gam Gam a whore!
We gotta go back.
We gotta go back and beat those guys.
- Oh, come on, man, that's crazy.
- Is it? We can do this.
We can do what?
Great Gam Gam.
Honey, what happened to your eye?
I accidentally walked into a wall.
Yeah, the Berlin Wall.
I'll tell Tippy to get
some cold pig stomach.
We put that on Janny's eye.
So tell me,
was the ceremony beautiful?
Yeah. Very beautiful. I mean, gorgeous.
Was it a peaceful resting place?
Have you ever been
to the family resting place?
No, but I've been told it is wonderful.
- Quiet, lovely.
- Yeah.
And how is Herr Schniedelwichsen?
- Oh, he's fine. Great guy.
- Yeah. Good.
He says hi.
Oh, you boys have done a great thing.
Now your grandpapa can rest in peace.
She couldn't be more not a whore.
We're gonna defend her honor.
We're gonna defend Grandpa's honor!
- We're gonna put together our own team!
- Yes.
We'll get the biggest drinkers, the best
beer-gamers, the fastest chuggers.
Then we're gonna go back
and kick the tar out of those Krauts!
That's my brother!
God, I missed you.
Beerfest it is.
They want a war?
We'll give them a war
they won't believe.
So how'd you find him?
Some dude, used to work
with him at the brewery.
Haven't seen him since
Hands Across America.
Oh, that's right.
I heard that when the brewery gave
him his pink slip, he killed a guy.
I heard that too.
There he is.
You got nothing, baby.
I got everything!
You got nothing! You got nothing!
We're gonna win this thing.
Can I have your autograph?
Oh, no autographs, kids.
No, no, no. Thanks anyway.
Get you next time.
Hey, guys. Good job out there, Naka.
Hey, Landfill! Hey, big guy!
Hey, look what the cat dragged in!
I haven't seen you guys since...
Hands Across America?
We were just saying that.
We almost made it.
Couple breaks in the chain, right?
What's going on?
You disappeared for a while.
We heard you got fired from the brewery.
Goddamn brewery!
They brew 10,000 bottles of beer a day.
I drink 45 off the assembly line,
and I'm the asshole.
Jim Tobleson said they called in
a hostage negotiator.
Jim Tobleson's a fucking Chatty Cathy.
I did my three years up at the county pen.
Made some friends, went Muslim.
Now I'm out, praise Allah.
I heard that someone died that day.
Yeah, somebody did die that day.
Me.
I had the greatest job in the world,
brewing cold, fresh joy for thousands.
Not to mention all the beer
you could drink, right?
They took it away from me.
Yep, I'd trade all this in if I could get
that feeling back again.
What?
There he is.
Nathan Cornwell has discovered...
...pneumono-ultra-microscopic-
silico-volcano-canaisis.
Big round of applause, people.
You want that geek?
What's he gonna do, check my urine?
I met Finkelstein back in college.
He was a real brainiac, that nerd.
Studied everything about everything.
Including beer.
So shut the fuck up.
What are you doing?
Put the frog on the table.
Clean out the floxinator
or something, all right?
People, listen up. Use your thumbs.
Locate the seminal vesicle here,
the ejaculatory ducts here.
Then stroke it.
Stroke it. Stroke it hard.
Cup the gonads.
If you don't cup the gonads...
Finky!
Jan? Todd?
What are you guys doing here?
- Hey, smart coat.
- Oh, thank you. It's rayon.
What are you doing?
We're extracting frog gamete
for cloning trials.
You're jerking him off.
- Who's the hippo?
- Phil Krundel.
The name's Landfill.
Listen, Fink.
We're putting together a drinking team.
There's a competition
and we want you to be part of it.
- Come on. I'm really busy.
- We're serious.
You don't understand. I'm a respected
member of the scientific community.
Sorry.
- We can't do it without you, Fink.
- No chance. I have a job.
I've got a house with a pool
and a two-car garage. I got three Ph.D.s.
Hey! Don't do that!
- I'm published in four journals.
- What?
We need you, Fink.
America needs you.
That sounds a little dramatic.
That's the part we haven't told you.
We're competing against the Germans.
Germans?
Yeah. Big, blond, asshole Germans.
You got 15 minutes to tell me more.
- Can you move over, please?
- I like to sit in the middle.
What am I supposed to do?
You have room. You're little.
- You wanna sit on this side?
- Fuck you.
Jan, who are we meeting out here?
- Jan, who are we meeting out here?
- Barry Badrinath.
- What? No.
- Who's Barry Badrinath?
- I'm putting a team together.
- Turn around.
- Who's Barry?
- Don't worry.
Who's Barry Badrinath?
Who's Barry Badrinath?
Will you shut the hell up? Shut up.
Barry Badrinath was the
best beer-gamer ever.
Best at Quarters, at Pong,
best at everything.
We should put him on our team.
Well, actually, Barry and Todd
had a falling-out.
- See, Barry doinked Todd's girlfriend.
- Yahtzee.
- Zip it, Fink.
- Sorry.
Just think about Gam Gam
for a minute, all right?
- Is this guy really that good?
- Yeah.
He's the best.
We should put him on our team, then.
- There he is.
- Where?
Right there.
Oh, my God.
What happened to him?
All right. It's a regular
hot-dog cart in here, huh?
All right, here's how it works.
One dollar to look at it.
Two dollars to touch it.
Three dollars to watch me touch it.
That's lots of nice-looking manhood.
Back the fuck up, Antonio!
My dick!
My apologies.
Five to touch it
while I touch my toes.
Six dollars to touch it
while I touch your toe...
Oh, hey, Jan. How are you?
Todd. And Fink.
- Hey, looking good, Finky.
- You too, Barry.
I wish I could give you a deal here,
but my pimp's a real ball ache, you know?
So it's $ 10 for a BJ,
$ 12 for an HJ, $ 15 for a ZJ.
What's a ZJ?
If you have to ask, big man,
you can't afford it.
I got $4.
Barry, we didn't come here for a BJ...
...or a ZJ or any kind of a J.
Move along, then.
I got a mouth to feed.
Barry, wait.
Jan, hold on.
That's not such a good idea.
Barry!
There's this big beer-games competition.
We're putting a team together.
- We want you.
- Twenty-five bucks.
No, no, no. You'd be training
with us over the next year.
- Thirty bucks?
- Jan, forget it.
No, just show us some of
the old coin tricks. Come on.
Oh, please, Jan, let's get out of here.
- No. Wait.
- No?
Clearly, you've fallen on hard times.
This would be a chance
to get back to the glory days.
It's a chance to show you still got it.
You still got it, right?
You bet your ass I do.
Show them.
Watch and learn, baby diapers.
Just like college.
It's nothing to worry about.
He's shaking the cobwebs off.
I got it. I got it.
All right, here we go.
- A little sticky on the:
- Yeah.
- This guy blows.
- Come on. You can do it.
Glasses, maybe. I...
What are you looking at?
Barry, what happened to you?
Get out of here! Get out of here!
- Get out of here!
- Barry, Barry...
- Get out of here!
- Help! Help!
So, what about
Dan "The Magic Man" Dunchkowski?
He'd down a beer ball
with every meal.
He's no good.
He had that Al Roker surgery.
He went black?
Don't be a moron.
He got his stomach stapled.
Most he can fit are two Triscuits
and a glass of water.
Really?
Oh, boy.
Wolfhouses, I want on the team.
Forget about it. You're done.
You don't have any more, Badrinath.
Oh, yeah?
He's got a gun!
Unbelievable!
That's incredible.
I'm better when I'm drunk.
- I'll say.
- Of course. So is everybody.
Hey. Looks like we got ourselves a team!
- Get them in there.
- All right!
Well, boys, if we're gonna train...
...we're gonna need a training facility!
It's perfect!
It's amazing!
Look at the size of this
graduated cylinder: 2000 milliliters!
A direct-draw beer dispenser.
Half-barrel capacity,
with an anti-foaming mechanism.
These are really the coins?
Hey. I think I found us
a creepy new mascot.
Yeah, fuck it.
Yeah, give it a rim job.
Don't. That belonged to our grandpa.
Sorry.
Listen up, fellas.
The next 11 months
are gonna be tough.
As tough as anything you've ever done.
We're gonna drink beer.
And a lot of it.
If anybody here isn't up to it...
...l'm gonna give you one last chance
to walk out that door.
- That's a good one, Todd.
- Good. That's what I wanted to hear.
Because in this silver slice of
heaven here are 1984 ounces of beer.
Golden, delicious beer.
And no one leaves here until we finish
every single last drop.
All right, let's have the keys.
- All you guys. You too, big boy.
- Don't lose these.
All right, Fink, hit me.
Sorry. I'm a mathlete, not an athlete.
Hey, Barry, how about
a little warm-up match?
Good one. But I'll leave
the practicing to the amateurs.
All right, guys, let's focus, huh?
Huddle up.
All right!
Guys, those Germans
are incredible drinkers.
Better than anything I've ever seen.
Now, Fink, they've got
this thing called The Boot.
There's a secret way to drink it.
I don't know what it is.
- You'll have to figure that out for us.
- You got it, Hot Toddy.
One more thing,
I cannot stress this enough, people.
This is a super-secret competition.
You cannot tell anybody about this.
Or else what?
The guy that brought us there,
they killed him.
But let's not worry about that now.
- Let's drink some beer!
- Yeah!
- All right!
- Yeah, cheers!
Ice cold.
- Anyone else's cold?
- Really cold.
Drinking and dancing at the same time.
That's what's making it tough.
Thought there might be a bug in there.
My teeth hurt, it's so cold.
That's what makes me have to stop a bit.
- How many beers in this thing?
- About 125 beers, yeah.
A hundred and twenty-five?
Might have a cavity here.
- You're dead, bitch.
- Oh, yeah?
Remember we made Fudgsicles out
of shit and Mark DeFanti ate one?
Eight points.
These big ones have
a different flight pattern.
Nobody said it was gonna be easy.
That shiner's sure starting to fade, huh?
Yeah, I kind of wish it wouldn't.
It's great motivation.
A reminder of the humiliation.
I wouldn't mind having it
while training.
Okay.
You are a good friend.
All right, here we go.
Oh, yeah.
I know you love it, Muscle Lips.
Let's go.
Lap it up, you hungry son of a bitch.
Sorry.
Get a handle on your Frisbee, college boy.
Don't go there. You do not sully a yarmulke,
you
I don't know why you're here.
You can't drink beer.
I'll show you how to drink
a beer, motherfucker.
Fucking man cow.
Hey, I think somebody's trying
to chug in my face!
Look out, Germans!
You got  Fuckelstein.
- That's great.
- Hey, Todd.
About the old girlfriend thing.
Can we bury the hatchet, buddy?
- I don't know.
- It was just a one-night stand, right?
Wasn't even that good-looking.
Real dead fish, right?
I mean, she just laid there, taking it
like a plastic fuck doll, am I right?
I happen to have married
that plastic fuck doll!
Todd, no!
Hey! Get off him!
Someone's chewing my leg!
I hate you, Badrinath!
Oh, my God. Phil. Phil, honey.
Oh, my God.
Hello? Yes.
We need an ambulance immediately
at 622 Francis Drive.
Come on, Phil.
Stay with me, honey.
Oh, my God, what is that?
Ham.
Phil?
Not again.
How'd we do?
Not good.
If we're gonna drink like the Germans,
I think we're gonna need a little help.
You don't have to yell.
Don't say anything to Great Gam Gam
about the competition.
Don't talk about her being a whore.
- She's a whore?
- No, she's not a whore.
- So what if she was a whore?
- She's not.
I'm just saying, some of
my best friends are whores.
Yeah, we know.
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Wolfhouse.
- Can I help you?
- Who are you?
My name's Cherry.
- Is everything okay?
- Everything is fine.
Great Gam Gam.
Cherry is here to help me
now that my Johan is gone.
darling great-grandboys...
their delicious-looking friends.
Come in.
And summer sausage.
Just came out of the refrigerator.
Here, try this. Oh, no, wait.
Here, let me warm it up for you.
No, that's fine. We're okay.
When we were at Oktoberfest, we noticed
that the Germans were excellent drinkers.
- Oh, yeah, that is true. That is a true thing.
- How do they get good?
Well, from the time
that they are little kids...
...Germans are raised
to be excellent beer drinkers.
- How?
- Well, for one thing...
...they train high up in the Alps.
Interesting. High-altitude training.
Similar to the Kenyan marathon runners.
They are also taught to relax
the muscles of the throat.
Germans can pretty much
stick anything down there.
I myself can probably fit in at least...
Oh, at least nine inches.
- Here, let me show you.
- No. You don't have to demonstrate.
What else do the Germans do?
They also practice by drinking
the urine of a ram.
- The what?
- They drink ram's piss.
- Because of the pH balance?
- No.
Because if you can drink ram's piss,
fuck, you can drink almost anything.
- She said "fuck."
- Gam, who's drinking piss, honey?
No, I was saying it was a tradition
back in the old country.
Damn, that's nasty. The old country
must have been fucked up.
Now, come on, baby,
it's time for your nap.
- Come on.
- Okay. Well...
See you boys later.
I always sleep better
when I have a little sausage in me.
Look, if you ask me...
...l'd have to say the whole whore thing
is a real possibility.
Bavarians have been warming
sausages like that for hundreds of years.
Would you say
it's their oldest profession?
Shut up, Landfill.
All right, but more importantly,
where are we gonna find a ram?
I'm gonna fucking puke.
That's the most
disgusting thing I've ever drank.
I doubt that, playboy.
Oh, God, is there anything better?
Not right now.
You know, fellas,
maybe training alone on a rooftop...
...drinking ram piss isn't the way to go.
Maybe we should get out there and
mix it up with some randoms, you know?
- Smart idea, college boy.
- Go test our mettle.
Yeah, challenge somebody.
Challenge ourselves.
Let's get bombed!
Yeah!
Hey. Who ordered
the  makeover?
We're the party brigade.
We're here to play
some drinking games.
Drink. You're rowing on the wrong side.
You've gotta drink.
I've got one.
I never made out with Tommy Mullarky.
My turn. I never fooled around
with Coach Gerber.
This one's called the Strikeout.
What you're gonna do is take a hit...
...chug your beer, do a shot,
then blow out the smoke.
Here goes nothing.
Careful, dude. It's gonna fuck you up.
That's not bad at all.
"Strikeout," right?
That's nothing.
Don't...
...really, however, see what...
...all the...
...fuss is about.
- Oh, yeah. Way to go Dr. Finklestein.
- Do I know you?
- Yeah. It's me, Jerry, your paperboy.
- Hey, Jerry.
While I have you here, you forgot
my Sunday supplement last week.
Wake up, Finky. Wake up.
Cops, cops, cops!
Dude, aren't you like 40?
I'm 33.
Hey, what the hell?
Help!
What a great morning.
Night, ladies.
- Night, Todd.
- Bye, Todd.
Say hi to the missus.
All right, guys, come on.
- One, two, three.
- Go.
My glasses!
Two, three, go.
Maybe we'll move to mugs tomorrow.
He's so strict.
Hey, Finky...
...how you doing with The Boot?
- Not there yet.
I have figured out the problem,
I just don't know the solution yet.
Check this out.
Hey, fellas, gather up.
Here's the thing.
When you drink, the shape of the boot
causes an air bubble to form in the toe.
The bubble.
This air bubble
shoots around the heel...
...and explodes towards your face
while drinking.
In your face, it explodes.
- It's impossible to handle.
- It's impossible to handle.
It's unavoidable.
The Germans know how.
I find the whole thing frustrating
because I can't figure it out.
It's frustrating.
It's frustrating.
It's frustrating.
It's frustrating. It's frustrat...
Can you get the puppet off of me?!
- Hey, it's Popo.
- Sorry.
You knocked his head off.
Wait, wait. There's something in there.
Hey, what is that?
- Looks like it's German.
- Aren't you guys German?
- Yeah, so?
- Give me that.
I used to work
on a German cruise ship.
Yeah, it's a beer recipe.
- Really?
- What recipe?
Must be the old German beer recipe.
Those Germans said our grandfather
stole their family recipe.
- lf he had it, why didn't he brew it?
- Hebrew?
- Maybe he didn't know it was in here.
- It supposed to be good?
If this is the recipe, this used to be
Germany's greatest beer.
