Nurse Evelyn! Nurse Evelyn!
I have a message for you. In English!
And here we go.
Now, look, here's the list of all the patients
we've had in the ward in the last month.
Thank you, Nurse.
- You're Alexandria?
- Yes.
Your note came in, and landed on my lap.
Couldn't even understand it.
It's written in gibberish or something.
You didn't understand it, didn't you,
didn't understand it, it's not for you.
My name's Roy.
- How'd you hurt your arm?
- I fell.
Me too.
I was picking oranges.
Is that so?
How do you go to the potty?
I don't. They let me go right here.
- In bed?
- Yeah, it's true.
I don't believe.
Hey, Alexandria.
Hey, do you know
you're named after Alexander the Great
who was the greatest warrior
who ever lived?
Yes. And my note is not in gibberish.
It's in English!
Hey, I can see you. Come on out here.
I can see you hiding.
Alexandria.
Hey, did you know
he was also looking for a message?
- Did he find the message?
- What?
Did she find the message?
Alexandria the Great.
All right, right, I'll tell you,
just come in here.
Now, come on, grab that chair right there.
All right, don't break your other arm.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- What's in your box?
- Things I like.
- Things you stole?
- No.
A photo.
Where'd you get the elephant?
My friend gave it to me at work.
He's from India.
Look, this is my horse
- and this is my father.
- Yeah?
He's got the same gap in his teeth,
must run in the family.
- Yeah, and here is my house.
- Oh, yeah?
- It was my house.
- What happened?
- They burn it.
- Who burned it?
Angry people.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I said, I'm sorry to hear that.
Angry people.
Yeah, I know,
I'm just sorry that your house got burned.
Why did Alexander
didn't go from that buildings on his horse?
- If him was lost...
- What?
Why did Alexander didn't go
from that middle of the buildings
from that buildings on his horse?
Well...
Look!
I believe your wisdom shall save us all. "
- Why?
- Why?
What?
Why?
Well, because there wasn't
enough water for all of them
and it was Alexander the Great's way
of showing his army
that they were all equal...
It's stupid.
What would you do better?
Was Alexander throw the water
instead to give every soldier a little bit.
Hey, why don't you come back tomorrow
and I'm going to tell you a different story.
An epic tale of love and revenge.
- You know what "epic" means?
- No.
I still got this tightness here.
It's like I can't even...
It means a really long story,
and it's set in India.
...the elephant sitting on my chest.
- You should be fully recovered.
- All right, go on.
- I want you to examine me.
- Will you come back tomorrow?
You personally. I'm not very well.
The swelling seems down.
I know how much it hurts.
A sense of humor.
In the next couple of weeks the pain
should abate, then one more operation.
Like the last one?
This is going to take some effort
on your part, too, you know that?
See?
Come on, then.
- Be back before lunch.
- Okay.
Alexandria, get away from that ice.
I see you licking that ice,
you're gonna get sick.
I want you to go play, go!
Next time, I'll glue your lips to this
and carry you away.
You're lucky it was just a horse
that got killed.
I mean, jumping off a train bridge
was suicide, too.
And if you were trying to impress her...
Sinclair already did a better job.
You know, the actor,
- the leading man.
- I know who he is.
Every cloud has a silver lining,
that's for sure.
Take another card.
- You know, before my accident...
- That is the Queen of Hearts.
...nothing was happening for me.
Now I've had my leg hacked off by savages,
mangled by chariots,
sawed off by lumberjacks.
Hell, I've even had a harpoon through it.
I'm working all the time.
That is the two of spades.
- The studio is just trying to do right by you.
- Excuse me, Mr. Sabatini.
Take the money.
Anyway, gags are not for you, Roy.
You're a college man.
Wasn't me.
One cripple to another...
I didn't throw orange at you.
...no woman is worth suicide.
Like the guy's a movie star, for chrissake.
Was your friend a pirate?
Was your friend a pirate?
Sometimes.
Is that how he hurt his leg?
No, he... He does tricks for pictures.
You know, flickers.
Moving pictures.
- I never seen one.
- You're not missing much.
Is that what you do, like your friend?
Just once.
Will you tell me the story now?
- What story?
- The epic.
All right.
All right, close your eyes.
What do you see?
Nothing.
Rub them.
Can you see the stars?
Tell me, Indian.
Is it true?
Luigi, is what true?
Governor Odious will execute
your twin brother tomorrow morning.
My poor brother.
What is that, Wallace?
I don't know why flamingos are pink.
Americana Exotica.
But I don't like pirate stories.
You're the one who asked for a pirate story.
- No.
- Yes, you did.
I just wanted to know
if your friend was a pirate.
- Why?
- Because he has just one leg.
Oh, right.
Well, yeah, it's not a pirate story.
It's a story about bandits.
I need to learn to swim.
Finally, very little was known about
the gap-toothed Masked Bandit.
We must conceive a plan!
I need to get off this island,
and rescue my twin brother.
What? What?
All elephants?
I say, we...
I have an idea.
Darwin! That was a great idea!
Come on, Otta Benga!
Goodbye, my beautiful friend!
Have a nice swim!
Darwin, you are a genius!
Much obliged!
Where do you get these ideas?
What is it, my friend?
How sad. The tortures of this world
have driven the poor man mad.
Not true.
He said he has been sent by his mystic cult
to help us against Governor Odious
and his Spanish henchmen.
This region was once a lush forest
alive with birds and sacred trees
but Odious had them all burned down.
He also says the birds are safe
inside his belly
but we must take care
for only the fittest shall survive.
Tell him we have no use of a mystic.
We are on a dangerous mission.
We need to hurry to the fort
to save my twin brother.
He will only slow us down.
Fish,
Stand aside, my friend.
Before you say kaboom,
I have this door open.
Forgive me, wise mystic, for my disrespect.
Undoubtedly, you have a flair
for war-mongering.
It would be my honor
if you consider joining us
on our quest.
We must save your brother!
First,
a little test.
You can't stop there.
I just wanna play a little game. I want you
to go outside and touch one of my toes.
No, tell me the story.
What happened with the Blue Bandit?
It won't take long.
- Just go outside and touch one of my toes.
- Okay.
- I'm touching your little toe.
- No!
Please don't tell me
which toe you're touching. I gotta guess.
That's the whole point of the game.
All right.
I'm touching one.
I'm touching one.
You're touching my big toe?
Are you telling the truth?
Look.
Really.
Oh, I got that?
What happened?
What happened with his brother?
Did he save him?
No, no, no, no. Were you telling a story?
No, no, no.
Were you telling the truth just now?
No. I was telling the truth.
No. You just said no,
you weren't telling the truth.
No, I tell you it.
- Were you telling the truth?
- Yeah.
When you just touched my toe?
- You little liar.
- No.
Alexandria, were you lying to me?
I touch your big toe.
We need to hurry!
Do you want me to finish the story?
All right, that's it! It's not a circus.
It's not a playground for all your...
Please! Are you listening to me?
Get out of here!
- You leave her alone.
- Come here, baby.
Get off! Goddamn!
No, no, no, sweetheart, come here,
come here. Come on.
Dad?
- Dad? Dad?
- I'm not feeling real well.
- What do you want?
- He's doing it again.
Will you stop that? Leave him alone!
- What's that?
- Food.
- Where'd you get it?
- The chapel.
I'm sorry I shouted at you.
I was angry.
No problem.
Are you trying to save my soul?
Are you trying to save my soul?
- Do you understand me?
- What?
- Did you understand what I meant?
- What you said?
I said, are you trying to save my soul?
- Giving me that.
- What mean that?
The Eucharist. It's a...
What?
The Eucharist.
The thing you gave me. It's a...
It saves your soul.
The thing I gave to you, what?
The little piece of bread
that you just gave me.
It saves your soul.
- What? What? What?
- Are you worried about me?
Saves your soul.
Do you know what "soul" means?
- No.
- It's like strength.
Why does the old man
keep his teeth in a glass at night?
It's where he keeps his strength, his spirit.
His spirit is in those teeth.
Yeah.
Oh, you're missing a little strength
right in the front of your mouth.
The chapel's in the main block, isn't it?
Yes. What happened with the Black Bandit?
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
They keep the medicine in the main block,
don't they?
Yes.
That which has been taken from me
can never be replaced.
My brother...
I think of all the joys we had.
I could've saved you, but I was weak.
My grief has gone blood-red with revenge.
I'm stronger now.
I will search the four corners of this Earth,
find Governor Odious and joyously kill him!
By the Blue Bandit's honor, I swear
I will annihilate him
and everything that he loves!
I will destroy him! I will destroy him!
Destroy him! I will destroy him!
And every Spanish thing.
Are you with me, bandits?
Darwin! Which way to Governor Odious?
I tell him not to put the map with the bugs.
Are we lost?
Sorry,
Hey! No!
Hey! You can't eat it, it's poisonous!
What's he saying?
He says we should follow him
to greener pastures!
- What?
- He say it's greener down there.
Green? Down where?
I don't know.
To greener pastures!
Slow down!
The birds in his belly
crave greener pastures!
Hey! It is greener down there.
Greener pastures.
Slow down!
Please don't run!
The poison works faster if you run!
Slow down.
It's poisonous.
What?
He's giving us directions.
Go!
Slaves!
Odious's flag.
We must free the slaves.
Tell me, Alexandria, do you read English?
You always stop at the same part
when it's very beautiful
and interesting.
I just wanted to know
if you can read English.
Can you?
- Can you read English?
- Yeah.
- What's this?
- Paper.
No. What's this? This.
M-o-r-p-h...
Three.
- What's that?
- Three.
That's good.
I'm having a hard time sleeping
and I can't remember that story.
I need some pills.
I need pills in a bottle
that has this written on them.
M-o-r-p-h-i-n-three?
Yes. And it's in the main block.
In that room in the main block.
You understand?
- Ask the head nurse.
- I'm asking you as a friend.
- But it's stealing.
- No, it's not. Not if you need it.
It's no different
than stealing bread from a church.
- I'll ask them for you.
- No.
It's a bandit secret.
I need the pills
to finish the story. Understand?
- I can't get it...
- I'll do it.
Thanks.
You look beautiful.
Why do you put red on your cheeks?
Because it makes you look pretty
and healthy, too.
- Remember, back before lunch.
- I know!
Alexandria, no licking the ice today?
No. Thank you! Bye!
One bite maybe. But a pit of snakes?
M-o-r-p-h-i-n-three. M-o-r-p-h-i-n...
M-o-r-p-h-i-n...
Maybe you got...
I know it's important that you listen to me.
You've gotta think of your other children.
I'm so sorry.
You have to warn your other children
about the sounds of rattlesnakes.
This isn't a good time.
There are snake pits all over this area.
Wake up! Wake up!
You better get up or they'll chop you.
You get up! You better get up
and show these people you are sleeping.
These men will chop you if you don't get up.
Get up!
Get up. This isn't funny.
Please, let's leave this place.
Come on. Come on!
I do that all the time.
All you have to do is change your clothes
and hide the wet ones until they're dry.
You know what I do
when something frightens me?
I say the magic words.
Googly, googly, googly, begone.
Let's practice together.
The magic words.
Googly, googly, googly. Go away.
- Did you get what I sent you for?
- Yes.
- This it is.
- Yeah?
There's only three in here.
- You asked me for three.
- No, I asked you for a full bottle.
- But, you wrote...
- Was this bottle full of pills?
- Were there more pills in here?
- Yeah.
What did you do with them?
I throw them in toilet.
But I throw them away because you wrote
m-o-r-p-h-i-n-three.
Will they help you sleep?
A nap perhaps.
Did they free the slaves?
Come out, Odious.
Just like a butterfly.
Boys, she's mine.
What's the matter with that poor fellow?
Ever since the Indian's misfortune
he took a vow
to never look at another squaw.
But a man cannot show what's in his heart
when he hides his face.
Who, may I ask, are you?
To most I am known as the Masked Bandit.
The Scourge of the Southeast?
That's the one.
But that's only when I wear the mask.
Who are you?
Nurse Evelyn.
Once I was Lady Evelyn Everest Everhardt,
and now I am simply called...
- Sister Evelyn.
- She is not a sister.
Bless you. No. What? Yes, she is.
She doesn't have brothers and sisters.
No, she's a nun, like these nuns out here.
And she turned from the Masked Bandit,
and she said...
- May I be frank with you?
- Of course.
Although I've dedicated my life
to God and goodness
I secretly love throwing oranges
at our priest.
Take two turns to the left
and go to the bathroom.
No, you read my note.
What are you talking about?
Go to the bathroom.
No.
How do you know
about the priest and the orange?
Everybody knows
you like throwing oranges at the priest.
Even the priest knows, but I didn't
find that out from your gibberish message.
It's not gibberish.
She wants to ask you
how much days I have to stay here.
Well, I want you to stay here
until you get better.
Her cast will come off in a few days
but I'd like her to stay here
until she's completely recovered.
She wants to say
that we are spend here too much times
and we have to leave the city.
No, well, you just tell her
that you shouldn't be working in the groves.
That at your age it's dangerous
and you'll spend
the rest of your days picking fruit.
And then she'll fall. She surely will fall.
Thank you.
- What did she say?
- She says okay.
- Really?
- Really.
Alexandria, she asked me something,
didn't she?
No, that how we speak.
