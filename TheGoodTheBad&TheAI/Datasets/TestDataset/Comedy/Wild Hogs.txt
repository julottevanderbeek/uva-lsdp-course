meant Something. But clearly it doeSn't.
You don't care about me!
That'S fine. I don't care.
It doeSn't mean anything, Woody!
Remember, it'S juSt
a patch my wife made!
We Should go Somewhere
to yell at each other
where there aren't people
trying to kill uS.
Hey, Maggie.
ThankS for letting uS
hide in your houSe.
Yeah, thankS.
It'S hard not to when you're
Screaming and kicking down the door.
Hey.

If that getS deStroyed, it'S...
But you're Safe.

You got that right.

That iS So cool!
Cool aS a parking lot
made out of real leather?
- Oh!

That iS So  rad!
The bar waS my home.
When it went down...
I felt... homeleSS.
Del FuegoS,
go check out your new home!
Here'S the thing, you're
talking about a bunch of guyS
that grew up in broken homeS.
They really didn't have a home.
And now they've got one.
With a bidet in it.
- Thank you!

We love our bar.
ThankS, America!
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
Wild HogS!
