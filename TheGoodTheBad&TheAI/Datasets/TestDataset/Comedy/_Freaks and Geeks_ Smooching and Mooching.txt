NUTRITIONALLY.
HEY, UH, SO...

SLEEPING ON PEOPLE'S
FLOORS...
LATELY, SO, YOU KNOW,
I THOUGHT I SHOULD
PROBABLY GET A GOOD BAG.
WHY ON ETH ARE YOU
SLEEPING ON PEOPLE'S
FLOORS?
MY DAD KICKED ME
OUT OF THE HOUSE.
HE DIDN'T
KICK YOU OUT.
HE SOLD MY DRUMS.
THAT DOESN'T REALLY
SEEM LIKE AN INVITATION
TO STAY.
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.
HE DIDN'T JUST SELL
YOUR DRUMS.
I MEAN, THE MAN
MUST HAVE HAD A REASON.
YEAH. HE HAD A REALLY
STUPID REASON.
HE SAID...
THAT MY DRUMS
WERE INTERFERING
WITH MY SCHOOLWORK.
I THINK MY SCHOOLWORK
WAS INTERFERING
WITH MY DRUMS.
TERRIBLE.
WHY DON'T YOU SPEND
THE NIGHT OVER HERE?
ON THE COUCH.
WHAT?
REALLY?
YOU MEAN IT?
YEAH.
OH, MY GOSH.

IT'S HARD TO TELL.
WELL, DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN FIND OUT
FOR ME?
OK.
AND TELL HIM
TO ASK ME
TO MONA'S PARTY.
THERE HE IS.
THANKS.
Teacher: EVERYONE

WE'VE GOT A BUSY CLASS

BILL! PSST! WHAT

CINDY WANTED ME

IF YOU LI--
GENTLEMEN, CAN WE SAVE
THE CHITCHAT
FOR THE CAFETERIA?
TODAY WE WILL BE HAVING
A POP QUIZ.
CINDY--
GENTLEMEN!
YES...MR. HAL?
ALL RIGHT, NICK.
THIS IS WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.
GET HER TO STAY UP WATCHING TV
WITH YOU, RIGHT, UNTIL HER
PARENTS GO TO SLEEP.
THEN YOU OFFER
TO GIVE A BACK RUB.
YOU DO IT RIGHT...
YOU'RE IN.
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT,
ALL RIGHT?
LINDSAY AND I ARE JUST
FRIENDS, OK?
AND, ANYWAYS, I THINK
IT'S REALLY COOL
OF HER PARENTS
TO LET ME
STAY AT THE HOUSE.
THAT'S IT, ALL RIGHT?
OK, MAN.
JUST FRIENDS.
I DIDN'T REALIZE.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
LOOK, I--
IF SHE CAME TO ME
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT...
AND WAS, LIKE,
YOU KNOW, "NICK,
I LOVE YOU..."
I WOULDN'T TURN HER
AWAY.
DID HE TRY TO GIVE YOU
A BACK RUB?
NO.
WELL, HE WILL.
HE IF TRIES
TO GIVE YOU A FOOT
MASSAGE...RUN.
KIM, WHAT AM I
GONNA DO?
IT'S JUST TOO WEIRD
HAVING HIM IN MY HOUSE!
YOU HAVE TO
KICK HIM OUT, LINDSAY!
NO. I CAN'T DO THAT.
WELL...
THEN YOU'RE IN
FOR A LONG NIGHT.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
IT'S TRUE.
IF THIS IS SOME
KIND OF A JOKE...
AND YOU'RE TRYING
TO SET ME UP,
I'LL STOP BEING
YOUR FRIEND.
I'M NOT KIDDING.
IT'S TRUE!
SAM, YOU GOTTA
ASK HER TO THAT PARTY!
I DON'T--I DON'T
EVEN KNOW MONA!
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
IT'S WHAT CINDY WANTS!
I THINK SHE WANTS
TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
OH, MAN.
Neal: WHAT'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU?
YOU WANTED THIS FOR YEARS!
BE A MAN! GO GET HER!
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT--
BUT WHAT?
I'M SCARED!
WELL, THEY'RE NOT.
I CAN HEAR WHAT
THEY'RE SAYING RIGHT NOW.
"UH, HEY, CINDY,
YOU WANT TO GO WITH ME
TO MONA'S PARTY?"
"WELL, I WAS KIND OF HOPING
"THAT SAM WAS GONNA
ASK ME,
"BUT SINCE HE DOESN'T
SEEM INTERESTED,
OK, THOR."
OK, OK, SHUT UP.
I'M GONNA ASK HER.
HEY, CINDY? UM...
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?
HEY, SAM.
YEAH, SURE.
HEY, I'LL SEE
YOU GUYS LATER.
OK, AFTER
FRENCH CLASS?
YEAH.
OK.
WHAT'S UP?
I WAS WONDERING...
DO YOU WANT TO COME
TO MONA'S PARTY WITH ME?
I'D LOVE TO.
REALLY?

IT'S HAPPENING.
THEY'RE SMILING.
GOING OUT WITHCINDY,
AND STOPS
HANGING OUT WITH US?
HE WON'T.
HE'LL GET US IN
WITH CINDY'S FRIENDS.
LIKE VICKY.
OH, MAN, I LOVE HER.
THOUGHT YOU SAID
THEY WERE POD PEOPLE?
A CULT, YOU SAID.
THEY ARE.
BUT THAT'S ONE CULT
I WOULDN'T MIND JOINING.
BRING ON THE PODS.
UH, WELL
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.
OK.
IT'S GONNA BE
A LOT OF FUN.
YEAH.
CALL ME?
OK.
SEE YA!
IT'S ON.
NICK.
IT'S QUIET HOUR.
AM I BEING TOO LOUD?
I'M SORRY.
SHOULDN'T YOU BE DOING
YOUR HOMEWORK?
ME?
UM, YEAH,
I MEAN, I WAS.
YOU WERE?
THEN MAYBE YOU OUGHT
TO FINISH IT.
YOU'RE STARTING TO SOUND
LIKE MY DAD, MR. WEIR.
OH, YEAH?
WELL, THEN, YOUR DAD
IS A SMART MAN.
I'M A DRUMMER,
YOU KNOW,
SO, I MEAN, THIS IS
MY HOMEWORK.
OH, COME ON, NICK.
THIS ISN'T HOMEWORK.
THIS IS SCREWING AROUND.
NOW, IF YOU'RE REALLY
A DRUMMER,
YOUR HOMEWORK WOULD BE
PRACTICING YOUR DRUMS.
WELL, I'D LIKE TO BE
PRACTICING MY DRUMS,
YOU KNOW? BUT MY DAD
GAVE THEM AWAY.
WELL, THEN YOU GO OUT
AND YOU FIND 2 STICKS
AND YOU POUND ON A ROCK.
THAT'S WHAT A GUY WHO REALLY
WANTED TO BE A DRUMMER
WANTED TO BE A DRUMMER
WOULD DO IF SOMEONE
TOOK HIS DRUMS FROM HIM.
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS
IN HIGH SCHOOL,
I WAS WORKING
IN A DEPARTMENT STORE,
AND LEARNING
ALL ABOUT RETAIL,
AND I STILL GOT
STRAIGHT As.
NOW DON'T TELL ME
YOU CAN'T FIND TIME
TO DO BOTH THINGS.
YOU CAN'T BE THAT EASY
ON YOURSELF, NICK.
PUSH YOURSELF.
YOU'RE A SMART KID.
THAT'S REALLY, UM...
THAT'S REALLY COOL
OF YOU TO SAY, MR. WEIR.
IT'S TRUE.
OH.
BY THE WAY, THAT DRUMMER
YOU'RE LISTENING TO?
YEAH.
HE'S TERRIBLE.
THAT'S NEIL PEART.
HE'S THE GREATEST
DRUMMER ALIVE.
WELL, NEIL PEART
COULDN'T DRUM HIS WAY
OUT OF A PAPER BAG.
YOU WANT TO HEAR
DRUMMING?
ALL RIGHT. COME ON.
I'LL PLAY YOU DRUMMING.
THAT GUY IS AMAZING.
HOW DID YOU HEAR
ABOUT HIM?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THESE GUYS?
I GREW UP WITH
GENE KRUPA AND BUDDY RICH.
OH, GOD.
HOW DO THEY DO THAT?
THEY MUST HOLD
THE STICKS LIKE THIS.
I CAN'T DO THAT.
I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO DO THAT.
YOU CAN GO FASTER
THAT WAY.
OH!
GOD, HOW DO YOU
LEARN TO DO THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THEY TOOK A LESSON?
OH, MY--THAT IS INSANE.
NOBODY CAN DO THAT.
MAYBE I SHOULD
TAKE A LESSON, HUH?
HEY, LINDSAY, CAN I
ASK YOU SOMETHING?
HMM?
YEAH.
CINDY AND I ARE GOING
TO THIS PARTY TOGETHER,
AND I THINK IT'S SORT OF
LIKE A DATE.
REALLY?
YES.
SHE KISSED ME
GOOD-BYE TODAY
IN SCHOOL,
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.
I JUST STOOD THERE.
SHE KISSED YOU?
YEAH.
WHAT IF SHE WANTS
TO KISS ME AT
THE PARTY FOR REAL?
YEAH?
WELL, WHAT IF
I DO IT WRONG?
YOU CAN'T KISS WRONG.
YOU'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO
WHEN IT HAPPENS.
IT'S JUST THAT...
I'VE NEVER HAD
A GIRLFRIEND BEFORE.
JUST BE YOURSELF, SAM.
THAT'S
BE A GENTLEMAN
AND DON'T BE WEIRD
AND DON'T SMOTHER HER.
NICK WAS SO INTO ME,
HE MADE ME WANT TO MOVE
TO A DIFFERENT COUNTRY.
OH, MY GOD.
I DON'T THINK NICK'S
IN LOVE WITH YOU.
I THINK HE'S IN LOVE
WITH MOM AND D.
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS THE BEST
FAMILY, EVER.
Who is it?
Hey, it's Nick.

A WHOLE NEW WORLD.
I SEE DOUBLE-DATING
AND TRIPLE-DATING
AND CHEERLEADERS
AT YOUR HOUSE
AND ME AT YOUR HOUSE.
CONGRATULATIONS,
SAM.
I HEARD ABOUT
YOUR GOOD FORTUNE.
THANKS.
SHE'S THE ONE THAT
SHOULD BE THANKFUL.
YOU'RE A CATCH.
SO, CAN YOU GET BILL
AND I INTO THIS PARTY?
I DON'T KNOW. I HAVEN'T
REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
WELL,
THINK ABOUT IT.
I DON'T--I DON'T
WANT TO GO.
WHY NOT?
EVERYONE WANTSO GO
TO A MAKE-OUT PARTY.
IT'S A MAKE-OUT PARTY?
UH-HUH.
NOBODY TOLD ME IT WAS
A MAKE-OUT PARTY.
WELL, YOU BETTER
GET READY TO MAKE OUT.
OTHERWISE SHE'S GONNA
THINK YOU DON'T
LIKE HER.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
FRENCH KISS CINDY,
ARE YOU, SAM?
FRENCH KISSINGI WOUL
IS GROSS.
DN'T FRENCH KISS
IN A MILLION YEARS.
AND WHY THE HELL NOT?
HELLO.
GERMS. SPIT. MUCUS.
OLD BITS OF FOOD.
THAT'S JUST
TO NAME A COUPLE.
THERE'S A LOT
OF THINGS IN THERE.
I MEAN, WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO USE YOUR
TONGUE, ANYWAY?
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO KISS WITH YOUR LIPS?
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
A REAL KISS
UNLESS YOU USE
YOUR TONGUE.
WHY?
WHAT'S THE POINT?
I MEAN, WHAT ARE YOU
SUPPOSED TO DO?
LICK THE INSIDE
OF HER MOUTH?
ARE
YOU SUPPOSED
TO LICK HER TEETH?
DO YOU MAKE YOUR
TONGUE HARD OR SOFT?
GOD, BILL. ENOUGH.
WHAT? I WANT
TO KNOW NOW,
SINCE EVERYONE
SEEMS TO THINK
THAT FRENCH KISSING
IS SO GREAT.
OK, BILL.
YOU PUT YOUR TONGUE
AGAINST HER TONGUE.
WHAT IF SHE PUTS
HER TONGUE
TOO FAR INTO
MY MOUTH? WH--
WHAT IF I
THROW UP?
WHAT IF I THROW UP
ALL OVER HER?
WHAT IF I THROW UP
IN HER MOUTH?
UGH, SHUT UP, BILL!
THAT'S DISGUSTING!
SORRY.
WELL, I'M JUST
TELLING YOU GUYS
I'M NOT DOING IT.
WELL, I AM,
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
CAN WE GO?
WELL, IF I TAKE YOU,
THEN I HAVE TO TAKE
GORDON AND HARRIS.
GUYS, I CAN'T MAKE IT.
I'M SAVING MY VIRGINITY
FOR THE FUTURE
MRS. CRISP.
NAH, I HAVE A DATE
WITH JUDITH.
EVERY NIGHT'S
A MAKE-OUT PARTY WITH US.
YES.
WHOOPIE.
ALL THESE MAKE-OUT PARTIES
START THE SAME WAY--
SPIN THE BOTTLE.
THAT'S WHY THIS BOTTLE
IS THE KEY TO OUR
MAKE-OUT FUTURE.
HE SPIN
WILL DETERMINE WHETHER
WE HAVE A GOOD NIGHT
OR A GREAT NIGHT.
YOU CAN'T CONTROL
A BOTTLE, NEAL.
OH, CAN'T I?
JUST WATCH.
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING
ALL WEEK.
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?
IT'S ALL FINGER CONTROL.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TRAIN YOURSELF
TO MAKE THE BOTTLE SPIN
THEN YOU ADD OR SUBTRACT
A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF TORQUE
BASED ON THE POSITION
OF YOUR TARGET.
THAT'S AMAZING!
ALL I CAN SAY IS...
HELLO, LADIES!
WHAT?
WHAT IF...THEY DON'T
WANNA KISS US?
THAT'S THE GENIUS
PART OF THE GAME.
THEY HAVE TO!
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST...I JUST
DON'T WANNA SEE
THE EXPRESSION
ON THEIR FACE
WHEN THEY SEE
THAT THE BOTTLE
LANDS ON ME.
BILL, WHO CARES
IF THEY LOOK DISAPPOINTED?
ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS IF THEY LOOK DISAPPOINTED
AFTER THE KISS.
BUT I KNOW THEY WON'T
WITH ME,
BECAUSE I PLAN ON
DELIVERING THE GOODS.
DO PEOPLE FREN THE BOTTLE?
SOME DO.
MOST DON'T.
I DO.
I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.
I T
HINK I'M GOIN'
TO KATMANDU
THAT'S REALLY,
REALLY WHERE I'M GOIN' TO
IF I EVER GET OUTTA HERE
THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO
K-K-K-KATMANDU
I THINK IT'S REALLY
WHERE I'M GOIN' TO
IF I EVER GET OUTTA HERE
I'M GOIN' TO KATMANDU
I GOT NO KICK
AGAINST THE WEST COAST
WARNER BROTHERS

I RAISE MY WHISKEY GLASS
AND GIVE 'EM A TOAST

DON'T RUSH ME.
ARE YOU OK?
YOU REMEMBER THAT SCENE
AT THE BEGINNING
OFANIMAL HOUSE
WHERE FLOUNDER WANTS TO
GET INTO THE FRATERNITY,
BUT THEY DON'T
THINK HE'S COOL,
SO THEY PUT HIM
IN THAT ROOM
WITH THE BLIND GUY
AND THE INDIAN GUY?
ABOUT TO BE SENT
IKE WE'REINTO THAT ROOM.
BLIND GUYS ARE COOL.
THEY HAVE SUPERSONIC
HEARING.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
LET'S MINGLE.
SO, DID YOU KIDS HAVE
A GOOD DAY TODAY?
UH...
I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS OK.

THAT'S...
WHAT'S THE DEAL?
WELL, I'M TRYING
TO HELP THE KID OUT.
WHAT, YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO?
NO, I'M JUST
WONDERING WHY,
WHEN NICK
HAS A PROBLEM,
YOU'RE NICE
AND LOGICAL.
WHEN I DO,
YOU JUST YELL AT ME.
THAT'S BECAUSE
I EXPECT MORE FROM YOU.
NICK'S FATHER
IS A HARD MAN.
MY OLD MAN
WAS THE SAME WAY.
YEAH, I KNOW
THE FEELING.
LINDSAY?
TRUST ME, YOU DON'T.
NOW, ANYTIME YOU WANNA
DANCE WITH ME TO GENE KRUPA,
I'LL BE AROUND.
OH, WHY DOES THE BOTTLE
KEEP LANDING ON ME?
HEY, HOW COME THE BOTTLE
NEVER LANDS ON ME?
Girl: OK. WHOSE SPIN?
THAT'S 3 TIMES.
NOW IT'S 7 MINUTES
IN HEAVEN.
