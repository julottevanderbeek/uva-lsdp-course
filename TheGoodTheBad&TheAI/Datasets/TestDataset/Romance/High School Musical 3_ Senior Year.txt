Let's go!
- I'm open, I'm open.
- I don't see it!
- Take your time!
- Run!
- Run!
- Go, go!
- Let's go!
-  Defense! Defense!
Come on,
man!
- Hustle, hustle!
- Control that ball!
- Bolton! I'm open!
- Set it up! Let's go!
All right, let's go!
Let's move! Let's move!
- Watch the run in.
- Watch the back door!
- Get it!
-
All right! No more X's and O's. OK?
Forget about the scoreboard because
here's a number that matters.
Sixteen. There's 16 minutes
left in this game, guys.
There's only 16 minutes
left in the season.
And for the seniors
on this squad... guys...
...you've only got 16 minutes
left in a Wildcat uniform.
So make them count.
Sixteen minutes to be a team.
Captains!
All right.
Hey, guys.
Now, you heard Coach.
We're all gonna remember
the next 16 minutes
for a long time
after we leave East High.
So it's now or never.
Chad.
- What team?
- Wildcats!
- What team?
- Wildcats!
- What team?
- Wildcats!
Huddle up! Let's go!
Ready?
Break!
-
- Defense!
-
-
Come on, boys!
-
-
-
- Time out!
- Hey! That's a foul!
- Oh, dear.
- You OK?
- Come on, Troy!
Let's go, buddy!
-
-
Foul!
- Yeah!
- All right!
- What?
- Yeah!
I'm tripled-teamed.
I can't get a shot off.
- What do you want to do?
- Let's put in Rocket Man.
Rocket Man?
- Troy, you're two points away from...
- I know.
- Just get me the ball.
- OK.
Rocket Man! Come on!
Come on, Rocket Man! You're in!
- Get in here!
- Go!
- Let's go!
- Move!
Go, go, go! Move!
Yeah! Oh, yeah!
Calm down, OK?
- All right, keep your eyes on me.
-
It's now or never #
Come on!
Shoot it!
Yes!
We won, dude! We won! You OK?
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about. Yeah!
I'm pushing.
- You better be.
- I'm pushing!
- Push harder!
- Chad, tree!
Home sweet home.
- I'm saving for a new fuel pump.
- Mm-hm. Save faster.
Hey, turn it up, Kels.
- How you doing, girl?
- I'm good!
- Great comeback!
- Thanks.
- Watch that tail. It's dangerous.
- You know it!
- Amazing! We won!
- I didn't think they'd come back.
Hey!
- Congratulations!
- Thanks. Can I fix you a plate?
- I want one of everything!
- Are we celebrating?
What's up, Hoops?
- Back-to-back champions!
- Yeah, thanks.
Coach, got a couple
of empty lockers at U of A?
Hopefully not for long.
Charlie Danforth
will suit up next season.
Front row seat will be fine.
That teamwork I saw tonight, that assist
where you gave up the final shot,
that's the kind of players
I'm looking for.
We're going to see you
in Redhawk uniforms?
- Done deal.
- Amen to that.
- Go have some fun.
- OK.
- Congratulations, Troy!
- Hey! Thanks.
- Yo!
- Hey, dude!
Sweet game!
Hey, Troy. Great house, bro.
Your room is way cool.
Thanks, man. You were in my room?
Well, yeah. I just took a picture. Look.
- I'm doing mine the same way.
- Great.
We should hang out tonight.
Get to know each other or something.
I just gotta grab the championship
trophy I left it in my truck.
- Don't sweat it! I'm on it!
- OK.
Hi!
So, another top-secret hiding place?
You're the second girl I've had up here.
The first was my mom.
She only climbed up here to get me down.
Well, I'm honored.
This place is so cool.
Me and my dad built it.
That the coach
from U of A down there?
- Yeah. He's at my house.
- Yeah.
Crazy.
I bet he's already got
your name on a locker.
It's always been my dad's dream. Now
I'm going to end up at his alma mater.
Did I just say that?
My mom and I have been talking about
Stanford pretty much since I was born.
And you're already in. That's so cool.
Except she won't stop talking
about it. It's embarrassing.
Come on. She's proud of you.
I'm proud of you.
The thing about Stanford
is it's a thousand and fifty...
...fifty-three miles from here.
I know.
It suddenly seems like the rest
of the school year is coming so fast.
Yeah. I wish it would all just stop.
At least just slow down.

# You and me #
Is this a pirate's wheel?
No.
Very cute.
I haven't played
with Robo-Rob since third grade.
- I'm Robo-Rob. I am...
- Don't break him. Don't break him.
- That's Chad's.
- Sure it is.
Now it's just like kindergarten.
Troy? You have guests.
Don't make me come up there
and get you again. Hi, Gabriella.
We'll be right down, Mom.
She really will come up here
if we don't go down.
Oh, OK.
Right there, right there. OK,
come on through. Come on. There you go.
Wow.
Hey, Troy.
So, when's the big game?
Uh, yesterday.
Oh, well. Good luck.
- Wow.
- She's so sweet.
What are you? I mean, who are you?
Good morning, Ms. Evans. I'm Tiara Gold.
I transferred
to East High from London
and I noticed on the board you're
in need of a personal assistant.
Yeah, with finals, prom, graduation,
I need someone tracking
my appointments and assignments.
Most important, I need someone
to run lines for the musical.
- That's a theater term for...
- Learning your role. I understand.
It's best to keep
science and math books together,
since those are
first lessons of the day.
How do you know my schedule?
I took the liberty of checking,
simply to make certain
I'd have your nonfat, no-foam,
soy latte ready for free period.
- One packet of sweetener?
- Organic.
I'll e-mail you my wardrobe choices each
morning so that our outfits won't clash.
If you own any orange, get rid of it.
By the way, like the accent.
It's... sweet.
Troy, my brother.
Can I have your gym locker?
- What?
- Like starting next week.
I'll be running the team next season
and it'll help me out with the guys.
- Yeah, why didn't I think of that?
- I don't know.
Tardy again. Later, bro!
Are you serious?
What about her... Hey.
All right, everyone. Settle down.
We are all excited about our Wildcats'
- top-to-bottom championships.
- That would be "back-to-back."
Whatever the case,
it was a grand slam. Well done!
And our student body president
and co-editor of the yearbook,
Taylor McKessie,
has important announcements.
Senior trip committee meets tomorrow
and reports Thursday to prom committee,
headed by Martha.
Pick up your tickets from her.
This year's theme is "The Last Waltz."
But don't be last to pick up tickets.
Graduation committee convenes Monday.
Picture deadline is Thursday
and finals study groups alternate
with all of the above. Questions?
What's the lunch special
in the cafeteria?
New York deli. Anyone else?
Moving on. Ms. Sharpay Evans, four-term
president of the drama club,
spring musicale report.
Well, with prom, finals,
everyone is so busy.
I was thinking
I'd select something modest.
Perhaps even a one-woman show.
A little light on the sign-ups, Kelsi?
No. We're actually doing pretty well.
Well, well, well.
Almost the entire homeroom.
How inspiring!
I will happily see all of you
at free period to discuss the show
and to make a very special announcement.
I'll be retaking my finals two or three
times. I'm moving into the library.
I'm working on my truck every day.
I've got five recipes
for Family Science final.
We've got a yearbook to edit, so no.
Sorry! Jeez. I thought since it was the
last show, everyone would want to do it.
- You're wrong.
- We just don't have time.
Hey. Hey, you guys, listen up.
Kelsi's right. We should do this.
This is our last chance
to do something together.
All of us. Something really fun.
Oh, yippee.
So, what do you say, Wildcats?
No, I still don't think
it's a good idea.
- Guys, come on! It's our senior year!
- Troy.
We're all in this together.
This is our senior year.
I'm in.
What?
- It will be fun.
- Yes!
- Oh, boy.
- How much time will it take?
Yeah. And what the heck
is the show about?
You, Mr. Danforth.
Me?
The spring musicale is all about you.
Hold up. If it's about me, then
can I have my ball back? Please?
- It's about all of you.
- Go!
And all of you will create it.
A show about your final days at
East High. We'll call it
Genius.
Uh-uh-uh! Playing a role is easy,
but being yourself,
now that's a challenge.
Miss Darbus, exactly...
Kelsi will compose,
Ryan will choreograph
- and I will direct.
- Thank you.
Now, I have
some very important news from...
...the Juilliard School
in New York City,
America's preeminent college
for the performing arts.
And for the first time
in East High history,
Juilliard is considering four of you
for one available scholarship.
- Miss Sharpay Evans.
- I'm already packed.
- Mr. Ryan Evans.
- Dance.
- Miss Kelsi Nielsen.
- What? They got my letter?
They certainly did.
And, lastly, Mr. Troy Bolton.
What?
Juilliard will be sending
representatives to observe our show.
So good luck to our four applicants.
Yeah, nice. Nice, guys.
That's pretty funny.
So... who's the big comedian?
- Is there something wrong?
- Yeah. Yeah, I didn't apply.
- I've never heard of Juilliard.
- Well, that may be, Mr. Bolton,
but evidently Juilliard
has heard of you.
And as you create this show,
you must dig deep
and think about your aspirations
and dreams for the future.
Line up, downstage, please.
Let's begin with Mr. Danforth.
Step forward, please.
Your future.
It's easy. It's U of A.
Hoops all the way.
- Yeah.
- Miss McKessie.
I'm going to be the President
of the United States.
Oh.
I'm going to finish
college first, of course.
Martha Cox, you're late.
I'm sorry, I just thought maybe
we could use a few more dancers.
I feel a show coming on already!
Mr. Bolton.
- Mr. Bolton.
- Hmm?
- Your future.
- Oh, yeah, uh...
You know... uh...
I've been thinking about...
Uh...
I think we should stage
the perfect prom.
Golly gee, how adorable.
What do I want?
Gosh, I wouldn't know
where to begin.
But I know where it ends.
Center stage.
A single spotlight.
A huge marquee that reads...
New York deli platter, please.
- How can you think about food?
- Maybe because it's lunch time?
No pickles.
Throw that Big Apple parfait in.
OK, this show is our last shot, Ryan.
Sharpay's meal, please.
Thanks. That's great.
Troy pretended
to know nothing about Juilliard.
- Give me a break.
- He seemed surprised to me.
The theater fairy magically
sent in Troy's application?
Performers can't fool me. They're
deceitful, ambitious and ruthless.
- Aren't we performers?
- Exactly.
- Hmm.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-

-
-
-
-
- I love you!
-
-
-
-
- Get out of the way!
-
- Madison Square Garden!
- They love you.
Thank you! Thank you all!
It's Oprah calling.
Again.
She wants you on the show.
They're going to get back to you.
- You know how fast you were going?
- Officer Chad!
Hey, it's Ms. Evans.
How you doing? Follow me.
-
-
-
-
-

# All #
It's ours, Ryan.
Wait a minute. Miss D said that
there's only one scholarship.
There's two of us.
We're twins. They're going
to have to take us both.
Listen, Kelsi always writes her
best songs for Troy and Gabriella.
So you make certain we get those songs.
How?
Polish her glasses, buy her some
ruby slippers, take her to prom.
I don't know.
Just do it.
- Hey, Tay.
- Morning, Sunshine.
- You going to rehearsals today?
- Uh, do I have a choice?
You got us into this. I don't
understand. You might not be here.
Told anyone you're up for
Stanford's Freshman Honors?
No.
You're gonna hear from them any day.
- Hello?
- Taylor, these things take time.
- Hey.
-
- What?
-
I have to go.
This has two weeks detention
written all over it.
Have fun.
I really need your help.
Which one do you think I should wear?
Because?
Because you're going to have
a pretty dress, so I want to look right.
I've never been asked to a prom, but
this almost sounds like an invitation.
This one.
I've never been to a dance,
much less a prom.
But I was hoping these
might be a good start.
Do you think we're going
to have to waltz?
Because I have no idea how to do that.
All I know is what my dad
taught me when I was a little girl.
I'd stand on his toes, and he'd
waltz me around the living room.
Come here. I'll show you.
- What?
- Come here.
- We're on the roof.
-
Come here. You'll love it.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
# Can I have this dance? #
- So is that a yes?
- In every language.
Yes.
-
-  Oh, come on!
Where's our clothes?
- Yo, Rocket Man.
- Oh, there they are.
- Thought you wanted our lockers.
- It's moving day.
Oh, sweet.
- Good job.
- Thanks, man.
Perfect timing, Bolton.
We weren't just given these lockers.
We had to earn them.
Right. Right. Thanks, man.
- Chad, what's the combo?
- What's the combo?
It's like he said.
You got to earn them.
What's that supposed to mean?
Hey, guys! Come back.
What are you talking about?
- Not cool, guys!
- Hey, Bolton! Danforth!
Hey, stop playing games!
This isn't funny, guys!
Chad, up top.
- I got it.
- Spike!
- Let's go! Out!
- Give me my clothes!
- This isn't funny, guys!
- Just give me my clothes, man!
Look out. Coming through.
Hey, those are new jeans!
I need those back!
Arms, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
You're really stressing me out.
I need to breathe.
And I don't know what Ryan is doing.
He's doing some kind of
yoga Fosse thing.
Two, three, four... What are you doing?
...six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, great,
five, six, seven...
Troy, just give me my clothes!
- Yearbook opportunity.
- Photo op.
Smile!
Wow.
- Hi.
- Bold choice, gentlemen.
We all must have the courage
to discover ourselves.
However, at East High,
we will discover ourselves
whilst clothed.
But welcome to our drama club
and our spring musicale.
Yeah, welcome.
The stage crew can use
your help during detention...
...painting sets.
Throw a sheet over them.
Ryan!
OK. All right, guys,
let's go back up to the top.
Jason, why don't you come
down here and help me out.
Fuel pump...
...work in progress.
If my truck falls apart
because I'm spending my time onstage,
it's your fault.
You think I'd be spending any time
at all up there if it wasn't for you?
You know what? I do.
- What?
- You're so good.
I watch you in rehearsals. You love it.
Why is that so hard for you to admit?
It isn't, to you.
But to my dad? To Chad?
Yeah, it's a little hard.
It shouldn't be.
They're happy as long as
we're all talking about U of A.
You chose Stanford. U of A
was sort of chosen for me.
I haven't talked
to anybody about this, but...
...I've had offers from other colleges.
- I'm really listening.
- I get it, Troy.
I still have decisions to make, too.
Like what?
I thought I heard you. I was just making
some snacks inside. Are you guys hungry?
- I interrupted something, didn't I?
- Just talking, Mom.
- Homework.
- OK.
Speaking about homework... come on.
I was joking.
Compliments of Zeke.
Be careful, they're still hot.
He doesn't know they're gone.
Eat the evidence.
Kissing up to the yearbook editors.
Very smart move.
Chad's hoping for two pages on himself.
Maybe even a third page,
just for his hair.
Hey, what's right is right.
Hoops, by the way, could you take me
after school to check out that tuxedo?
Tuxedo? For what?
For prom.
Honey, if that's
what you call an invitation,
you'll be dancing with yourself.
Ohh.
- Yo, yo, yo. It's lunchtime.
- Come on, people. Go!
- You ready?
- Yeah.
It's now or never, man.
The Garden Club is rooting for you.
Mmm.
- OK. I'm going in.
- Go get her.
- Troy, I really just...
- No, we're doing this now.
How long have you been up there?
- Hair's great.
- Don't...
I know. I heard that, too.
- Yes, good.
- Yes. OK.
- Your turn.
- So... Hey.
I was kind of wondering if you'd...
...maybe go with me.
Oh, hey, Chad. They have Tuna Surprise
on the menu. It's good. Really good.
Dude.
Taylor.
Hey, I'm asking you to prom.
I'm sorry, I can't hear you
because it's so loud.
- Did you hear something?
- No.
- Neither did I.
- Excuse me. Excuse me, everybody.
- What are you?
- Yo!
Oh.
My friend has something to say.
Taylor McKessie.
Will you please be
my date to the senior prom?
Aww...
- I'd be honored.
-
Dude, I need to go shoot
some hoops or something.
You nailed it!
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
Hey, you've been in there an hour.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
Guys, right here. Guys!
-
-
# Never never forget #
Bravo! Brava! Lights, please!
Kelsi, splendid music.
Ryan, your choreography
is quite inventive.
- Thank you.
- And, Jason,
we do not chew gum in theatre or prom.
See me at detention.
Lighting crew needs help.
Excellent work, everyone.
Costumes on the rack.
I will see you all tomorrow.
Kelsi's writing something amazing
for Troy and Gabriella.
A song, most likely.
- Just find out what it is.
- OK.
Hi, Boi! How was I? Thank you!
- Hey Troy, good job, man.
- Dude, stop doing that!
I'm sorry.
Look, there's Sharpay.
Now, you didn't hear this from me,
but she has a secret crush on you.
- A secret crush on me?
- Shhh!
Shhh.
- Should I talk to her?
- Yeah.
OK. All right.
Mr. Zara.
Yo! You can call me
"Rocket Man" if you want to.
How generous.
Mr. Zara, since you have become
such a dedicated presence,
I'm making you an understudy. Miss Gold!
- You as well.
- Nice.
I'm in!
I'm playing "The Understudy."
- Congrats.
- Right. What's up?
"Understudy" isn't a role, you moron.
You go on if one of the leads
can't make the performance.
Well, I hate to break it to you, sister,
but you're one, too.
The difference being I can carry a tune.
Listen, I wouldn't sing with you
if my hair was on fire
and you were the last bucket
of water on Earth.
I wouldn't sing with you
if I were starving
and you were
the last pickle at the picnic.
Want to go to lunch sometime?
Gentlemen, start your engines.
That's what I'm talking about, bro.
Yo, come check out these guitars.
What is this?
"Stanford's Honors Program cordially..."
-
- Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my goodness! "You and 29 students
are invited for early orientation."
Oh, my gosh, that's huge.
Your mom must be so proud.
Taylor, you're the only one that knows.
But you've already accepted, right?
I'm throwing a going-away party.
This is huge!
You can't get rid of me that easy.
We've got a yearbook to do.
- Back to work.
- OK.
- These are Sharpay's yearbook photos.
- Of course they are. Thank you.
This better be good.
