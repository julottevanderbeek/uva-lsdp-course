* Caroline laughs
and it's raining all day *
* She loves to be
one of the girls *
* She lives in the place
in the side of our lives *
* Where nothing
is ever put straight *
* She turns herself round
and she smiles and she says *
* "This is it,
that's the end of the joke" *
* And loses herself
in her dreaming and sleep *
* And her lovers walk through
in their cloaks *
* She's...
* Pretty in pink
Daddy, it's 7:30!
* Pretty in pink...
Daddy, it's 7:30!
Daddy, wake up!
Morning, Daddy.
Come on, wake up.
Wake up. Come on,
wake up.
Come on, wake up.
There's your coffee
right there.
Where am I?
Here. I want you
to drink this.
Then I want you
to take a shower.
Then I want you
to get dressed.
There are your
clothes right there.
And then I want you
to go see the woman
about the job, okay?
Today,
you promised.
I know.
What would I do
without you nagging me
all the time?
You really want me
to answer that?
God, I been getting in
kind of late lately.
We haven't had a chance
to talk, or anything.
Well, don't worry about it.
There hasn't been a lot to say.
Is everything all right
with you?
Yeah.
Is school good?
No, but it never is.
Have you been asked
to the prom?
No.
When was the last time
I told you
how beautiful you are?
About yesterday.
Hey, hey, turn around.
What?
You know what.
Come here,
let me see this outfit.
Is this your latest
creation?
Uh-huh.
This is it.
My God,
what did that cost you?
Oh, about $15 for the shoes,
secondhand and I made the rest.
Unbelievable.
I was thinking, maybe, that, um,
you could do something
with this.
Maybe put some ruffles up here.
Come on, get up!
Really, I mean it.
This means a lot to me.
Honey, I'm perfectly happy
with what I'm doing.
You're perfectly happy
with part-time work?
No.
That's why I'm getting up.
Okay.
I'll make some breakfast.
I'm up!

Hi, Blane.
Hi, Kate, how you doing?
Fine. How are you?
Good.
'Morning!
Welcome to another day
of higher education.
Hi, Duckie, how are you?
Mm, not all that bad,
considering I'm in this dump.
You know, this is a really
volcanic ensemble
you're wearing;
it's really marvelous.
Volcanic?
Well, you know,
hot, dangerous.
Are you going
to class today?
Well, I don't know
if I'm emotionally ready.
Oh, go for it-- it's
virtually painless.
Excuse me.
I gotta go, okay.
I'll see you at lunch.
Okay.
Well, listen, I'll call ahead
to the cafeteria and make
a couple of reservations.
You know, two
by the window.
Sure.
Ah, well, no,
you don't like
to sit in the sun.
Okay, something else.
Uh, listen, may
I admire you
again today?
Ah, ladies, ladies,
uh, listen,
I may be able to work out
a deal where either one,
or the both of you, could be
pregnant by the holidays.
What do you say?
Some argue that The New Deal
saved the capitalist system.
And as evidence
that the Roosevelt
administration was trying
to avoid excessive
governmental power.
Rather than
implant socialism,
in his first act as president,
Mr. Roosevelt enacted
The Emergency Banking Act,
and he refused to consider
nationalization.
Where'd you get
your clothes,
five and dime store?
KATE :
Attractive.
Is there a problem,
ladies?
No!
KATE:
No.
Andie, is there something going
on between you
and these ladies?
No, not that I'm aware of.
I'd like to apologize on behalf
of Miss Trombley
and Miss Hanson.
These two young ladies will be
thinking of you tonight
as they write a summary
of the chapters
that we've just covered.
Great.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Um, there's nothing wrong
with me, I mean, I fine.
Can you just forget
about the chapter?
Yes?
We'll take the chapter.
Fine. Let's go on.
The Emergency
Banking Act.
See you guys later.
Oh, Andie,
you look ravishing.
So, we graduate
in a month.
Now, I want to know
when it is you
and I are going to get together
and do something?
Try never.
Well, I'm talking
about more than sex here.
No, you're not.
You know, I've liked you
for four years
and you treat me
like shit, you know.
I don't,
I don't understand that.
What's your problem?
Can you get
off of my car?
You know, I've been out
with a lot of girls
at this school.
I don't see
what makes you so different.
I have some taste.
You're a bitch.
You know, I think
you ought to see a doctor,
'cause that condition of yours
can get a lot worse.
Applause, applause, applause.
This is beautiful.
It's so... modern.
I mean, is this fab, or what?
It's great.
I'm very,
very good at this.
I know.
Such a waste
that I run a lowly
little retail outlet.
No, not if you're good at it.
I'm good in bed.
Should I be a whore?
It's great.
Mmmm.
Did you say that you went
to your prom?
Yeah, sure.
Was it terrible?
It was the worst.
But it's supposed to be,
you know what I mean.
But you have to go, right?
Well, you don't have to.
I mean, it's not a requirement.
I have this girl friend
who didn't go to hers,
and every once in a while
she gets
this really terrible feeling,
you know,
like something is missing.
She checks her purse, you know,
she checks her keys,
she counts her kids,
she goes crazy,
and then she realizes that...
nothing is missing.
She decided it was side effects
from skipping the prom.
I don't know, I mean,
part of me says just go
and get it over with,
and this other part of me says
it's a stupid tradition
and what's the point?
Well, you know,...
you could say that life itself
is a... stupid tradition,
but don't analyze it;
just go.
Put that back!
You missed my eye by an inch!
Half an inch.
IONA: This ain't
the public library,
light fingers!
I'll get it.
IONA: Trax,
what do you want?
IONA: Tyrone,
you blow.
Yeah, I'm working.
Leave me alone!
That's thrilling!
I cook for you,
I do your laundry,
I sleep with you,
now you want a ride
to work?!
Please, grow up!
Take the bus!
Take a cab!
How you doing?
Fine.
Good.
Can I help you?
Yeah. Yeah.
Can I get your opinion
on something here?
Maybe.
Maybe.
This any good?
IONA: Sticks
and stones, Tyrone.
It's hot.
IONA:Sticks
and stones.
White-hot.
Good. I'll take it.
Okay, um, will that be cash
or charge?
American Express Platinum Card,
maybe?
IONA: Take a bus
to the zoo!
Cash.
IONA:
You know...
every time you go to the john,
you lose IQ points.
:
It's Walter Mondale.
And...
$7:50 is your change.
Thanks.
IONA:
Tyrone... no.
I don't need a bag.
No?
No.
IONA:
I can't do these
things for you.
Thanks.
Enjoy it.
Thanks.
IONA:
Bondage has no place
in my life.
Since when?
Since I spent the night tied up
in the backseat of your car!
* I stuck my head out
of an empty room *
* Expectin' nothin'
but the new room view *
* I swear
I saw the future below me *
* Spitting in the face of doom
* Yes, so I'm sayin'
* Tonight *
* Whoa, tonight
* Rudy, come on
and rule it tonight *
* Tonight *
* Yeah, tonight
* Rudy, come on
and rule it tonight *
* Tonight *
* Rudy...
* Tonight... *
Jena?
Yeah.
Well, would you ever consider
going out
with somebody that had money?
I don't think
it makes a difference.
I mean... it's material.
Simon?
Simon!
What would you do
if your father came
home a rich man?
Kiss his ass.
See?
See what?
What Simon
just said.
What S...
Andie, what are you getting at?
Are you... are you going out
with a rich guy or something?
I got to go.
Hey, wait, wait!
You didn't answer my question.
No!
Good.
Simon, it's been
stimulating.
How long
I been coming here?
I don't know,
a couple years.
Okay, so, you know,
we're buddies.
We're close, right?
Oh, yeah,
oh, yeah.
Very, pal.
Okay, so how many times
have you let me in?
I never let you in.
You know that.
You see, you see
what I'm saying?
I don't know.
What are you saying?
What I'm saying is,
my girlfriend is in there,
and I'm out here.
Well, she's a girl,
and she's my friend,
so she's a girl friend,
but she's in there,
and I'm out here!
I mean, you're a sensitive,
sexually potent
kind of guy.
You got to know how that hurts.
Well, let me ask you
a question seriously.
Why does she come here,
knowing I don't let you in?
Huh? Think
about it.
I don't know.
All right, my advice
to you is, uh...
dump her, lose her.
You don't need that.
You see what
I'm saying?
You see the point
I'm trying to make?
Love's a bitch, Duck.
Love's a bitch.
Ain't it the truth,
ain't it the truth.
Oh, it's
the truth.
High five.
All right.
Go for it.
Hey, want to try
a cigarette? Come on.
Oh, the babe,
the babe, the babe.
Hey, honey, honey, let me
ask you a personal question.
If you worship the Duck,
why don't you hang out somewhere
he could get in, I mean...
Dice, Dice Man, hey!
Say hello to the
wife and kids.
You know what
I'm saying?
Yeah.
You see, the Dice
Man is dyslexic.
He gets everything
backwards.
What he meant to say was,
like, if I worship...
It's okay, Duckie.
Okay, 'cause... you're sure,
because if he offended you,
I would gladly clean
up this parking lot
with his butt.
No, I'm fine.
Don't worry about it.
Okay, okay.
Were you here long?
Nah, nah, three,
four hours.
You have a good
time, at least?
Uh-huh.
Oh, good. That's
good. Now, what now?
Bed.
Yours, or mine?
Ours?
Nice try.
Okay. Can you at least
give me a ride home?
Yeah. Get in.
Aha. Can I, like,
put my head in your lap?
No, wait. Can I rest my head
on your shoulder
and let you steer?
Get in, Duckie.
Okay.
ANDIE:
These houses are
amazing, Duck.
DUCKIE:
Hey, the first million
I make, I buy you one.
I hate this song.
They're so
beautiful!
Hey, you want beauty,
look in the mirror.
This whole tape
is horrible.
I-I must be going through,
like, a hormone thing,
'cause every song
I listen to is making me sick.
I mean, why can't
I find a decent song here?
That one's my favorite.
Are you deaf?
The house!
Oh, yeah, yeah,
that's, that's...
That's a nice little,
little crib.
Wonder what it's like inside.
Well, what-what difference
does it make?
You know what the really
sad thing is, though?
I bet the people
that live there don't think
it's half as pretty as I do.
You know
what I mean?
You know, Andie, I'm just...
They just don't write love songs
like they used to.
It's... I-I... Oh.
I'm angry about this,
you know?
I... this...
My evening's shot. I...
Just drive me home now.
WOMAN:
That's...
That's right.
WOMAN:
All right.
DUCKIE:
Well, the reason I came over--
I mean, other than I've
been planning to come by
and just say hello--
I wanted... I wanted to
talk to you about Andie.
Yeah?
I mean, she's... she's an
incredible individual.
I mean, you
know that.
I mean, I'm
there for her!
Whenever, however,
I'm there.
You can rest assured
that she's covered.
I don't want
you to worry,
because my only future plans
are to make sure
that she's taken care of.
That's nice of you, Phil.
And I'd like to marry her.
Oh, well, not... you
know, not-not today,
but eventually,
I figure.
Well, does Andie know
how you feel about this?
Uh...
No confirmation
on that just yet.
I mean, I'm-I'm laying
the groundwork and everything.
You know, I'm thinking
in terms of housing,
you know, food,
basic needs type
of stuff, but
I'm picking my moment.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I mean, you
understand, right?
Oh, sure.
I felt the same way
about somebody myself.
Oh, a girl?
A girl.
Um, I loved her, and, uh,
I mar... married her.
And, uh, one day she just split.
Oh, wait. This was...
This was Andie's mom?
Yeah.
Oh.
So, uh, I haven't seen her
in, uh, three years, you know,
and, um, but I still love her
just as...
as much as I ever did, you know?
I mean, you can
love Andie,
but that doesn't mean
she's gonna love you back.
I mean, doesn't mean
that she won't, but, uh,
what I'm trying to say is,
you can't make it happen,
you know?
It either will, or it won't.
Uh, it's all in the heart.
Oh, y-yeah, sure.
I... Cardiovascular.
Yeah, I-I understand. I-I...
I've been
to school.
Yeah.
Well, uh, I got an appointment
with a vacuum cleaner.
Got to go.
Hey, you're on a
whole home improvement
jag here, aren't you?
Yup. Turn the old life around.
Yeah. Well, hey,
more power to you.
If Tina Turner can do it,
Jack Walsh can do it, too.
Well,
thanks for taking your time.
I really... You know,
I-I appreciate it.
My pleasure.
I'm off like a dirty shirt.
Tina Turner.
Hiya.
Hiya.
Um, oh, we just got
these glasses in.
They're really, um...
Yeah, I didn't like that album
I got the other day.
...dumb.
What?
What?
The record.
Oh, the record.
Uh, yeah, I thought
it was a little too, uh...
Too hip, maybe?
Yeah, a little too hip.
ANDIE:
Well, um...
BLANE:
Think you can recommend
something else
a little less political
or something?
Lionel Ritchie?
Nah.
No. Uh, well, hmm...
Tina Marie, Madonna?
Madonna?
Yeah, Madonna.
That's awfully deep.
Yeah, very deep.
But she's got
such great style.
Yeah.
Yeah, listen, um...
Um, that's the alarm.
Can you hold
on for a second?
Sure.
Just... I'll, I'll
be right back.
Okay.
Here, read this.
It's really good. Don't...
No, no, no, you can...
Hold on.
What is this?
:
Hi!
How's your day?!
Baby pumps out
about 300 decibels, huh?
Did you do this?
Well, I'm not sure.
I mean, I was just using
your powder room,
and I decided not
to disturb you,
so I was going
to go out the back door,
but I guess I must have
touched something.
How'd you
get in here?
Are you mad?
Yes, I'm mad!
There are public bathrooms
all over the place!
I'm not nine, Andie.
I know that.
It's just, it's the end
of the month.
They're out
of toilet seat covers.
DUCKIE:
You know what I stickler
I am about personal hygiene.
It's very
important to me.
ANDIE:
That's ridiculous.
We want you to
stop making...
Blane, what are you doing?
Hey, buddy,
what's up?
Nothing,
hanging out.
Well, what are you shopping
for, records or something?
I guess.
You find anything?
No, not really.
Not really.
Well, are we gonna shoot
some track, or what?
'Cause, I mean, if we're gonna
shoot, we got to shake it, man.
I don't have anyplace
to go.
I like coming here.
Excuse me very much.
It's okay. I'm sorry
for getting mad at you.
I got to get back
out in front, okay?
See you later.
This is a shitty
alarm system.
I opened and closed
the door five times
before it rang.
That's it,
I'm leaving.
I'm not going
to stay here.
No, no way!
Uh, hi, it's 6:05.
Duckie Dale. Give me a call.
Um, 6:15. Duckie Dale again.
Call me, okay?
:
Andie, where are you?
This is the Duck.
Give me a call, okay?
Uh, it's 6:28.
Please call,
please, please, please!
This is Duckie, are you really
home and just not picking up?
'Cause if so, I feel like
a giant asshole here.
It's 6:31, give me a call,
okay, please?
DUCKIE:
Andie, this is...
Duckie, I'll just talk to you
in the morning, okay?
Bye.
* Prospero il vento
* Prospero il vento...
What are you doing up?
I didn't wake you up yet.
Well, I'm fixing
breakfast.
One egg, over-medium,
and I fed the dog.
Oh, did Daddy
feed you, huh?
Your egg, madame.
Oh, I don't eat eggs,
Daddy.
Here, why don't you go in
and eat it.
I'll bring you your coffee
and juice, okay?
Okay.
Since when don't you like eggs?
Oh, since about birth.
Don't worry about it.
Hey, you never told me
why you were up.
Well, it's morning.
Oh, you mean,
why didn't you have to drag
my ass out of bed?
Okay.
Well, I gotta job.
No?!
Yeah.
Where?!
Um, well, I'll tell you
after I start.
When's that?
Soon.
I'm so proud of you!
You got the job.
No big deal.
Yes, it is a big deal.
It's a very big deal.
Listen, I gotta
go, okay?
I'm gonna be late
for school.
You tell me all
about it tonight.
I'm so proud
of you.
All right,
it'll be real good.
Hi, guys.
How you doing?
Fine.
And you?
Okay.
And you?
Well, I just said
I was fine.
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
So, is this your
first time out here?
Yeah.
I don't think
I'm very popular out here
either.
Oh, I don't know.
You're just fine inside.
I don't know.
I'm not really into
all their shit, you know.
Yeah.
:
Yeah.
Oh, um, I really liked
your computer trick.
Clever, huh?
Terribly clever, yeah, terribly.
Are you late for something?
Yeah, I am, as a matter of fact.
But I mean, it's no big deal.
Um...
Listen, do you want to...
you want to go out Friday?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Sure.
Yeah? Okay!
Sure.
Uh, 7:00, okay?
Yeah, that's fine.
Great. Great.
Well, where do you live?
I'll pick you up.
Where do you live?
Oh, I, I...
No, I'm sorry, um,
I'm gonna be working on Friday,
so you can just pick me up
at the mall.
Okay.
Okay?
Bye.
See ya.
Hey, Blane.
How you doing?
Hey, buddy,
what's up?
What are you up to?
Oh, not much.
Going to class.
I thought
I saw you outside.
So?
So, what are you doing?
What are you, my mother?
Come on, I gotta go.
I'll see you later.
Blane, what's going on?
Nothing.
Well, not nothing,
I mean, I saw you talking
to that chick--
what's her name?--
Eddie or something.
So, what do you care?
Listen, my best friend is
conversing with a mutant,
you know, I'm curious.
I don't think that's any reason
to get defensive.
I'm not defensive.
I just happen to like her,
all right?
Listen, all right,
it's you know,,
it's your life,
it's none of my business.
You really don't think
she's got something?
No.
I really don't,
I'm sorry.
You're gonna be late, buddy.
Okay, the Warsaw Pact's a treaty
that was signed
by the Soviet Union
and its seven East European
satellites, okay.
And what it did was...
it established a mutual
defense organization
as a counterweight
to NATO.
Duckie!
What?
What? What? What?
Well, what'd I put?
You wrote,
the Warsaw Pact is
the pact that's named
after Warsaw.
Uh-huh.
So, the teacher's just
gonna know
that you're just bullshitting.
Okay, okay,
what about the rest of it?
Well,
the Russian Revolution
did not take place
in Germany.
Ow.
Well, what was Karl Marx, then?
He was a German.
Well, there you go.
Yes, but his being German
doesn't have anything
to do with where
the Russian Revolution occurred.
Okay, okay.
Okay, Duckie, can I propose
something to you
without your getting upset,
or angry?
Well, that depends.
On what?
I don't know,
I just said that.
Go ahead.
Well, I propose
that you're deliberately
flunking your courses
so that you can stay
in high school.
Get out of here!
Why, why, why
would I do that?
I don't know,
you tell me.
Well, I'm not.
So, there's
nothing to tell.
Well, you know, you're not
always one to face things.
What, since when?
What, what am
I not facing?
The future.
Well, whether or not you
face the future, it happens,
right?
You run yourself down.
Why do you do that?
I am not running
myself...
You think I'm
running my...
I don't think I'm
running myself down.
Why b-b-because, because
of the way I dress?
'Cause, 'cause I can
laugh at myself?
That's called a
sense of humor.
You should get one;
they're nice.
What are we gonna do
next year?
Well, according to you, I'll
still be in high school.
No, I'm serious.
I mean, not a day
has passed,
in, what, eight years,
when I didn't see you
or talk to you
at least 20 times.
Well, that's devotion.
I know, and even though
I sometimes get angry,
you know that
I secretly love it.
You see, I knew that.
You know, I hope I'm not
the only one in the world
that knows what an incredible
person you are.
Well, at this point in time,
I'm afraid you are, honey.
Okay, I'm gonna get something
to drink
and then we work,
okay, you promise?
Oh, you bet.
Okay,
what do you want?
Oh, beer, scotch,
juice box, whatever.
Okay.
Oh, God.
I love this woman.
I love this woman
and I have to tell her.
And if she laughs, she laughs.
And if she doesn't love me,
she doesn't love me.
But if... if I don't find out...
Oh, I love her too much.
* Love is real...
Thank you, thank you.
* Real is love...
You're a wonderful crowd here,
you know that.
* Love is living
You're fabulous,
I do love you,
I do love you,
you're gorgeous.
I love your hair.
* Love is feeling
* Feeling love
* Love is wanting
Ah!
She's gonna laugh.
Would I blame her?
Here you go.
Oh, shit.
Honey, thanks, uh,
but I'm gonna split,
you know.
Why?
What about your paper?
Uh, that's, that's what
I'm gonna do, you see,
'cause, I mean,
if you help me, thanks a lot,
but it'll, it'll,
it won't be my work,
it'll be bogus.
And, you know, and I guess
I'll see you in the a.m..
Hey, drinking and
driving don't mix.
That's why I
ride a bike.
I got it.
JENA:
So, uh, what's the deal?
You going out
this weekend?
I don't know.
I'm not sure yet.
Mm?
Why? What are
you gonna do?
Stay home.
Yeah, you going
to study again?
Probably.
Would you put that out?
:
No.
Well, you study so much,
it makes me ill.
I just don't
see the point.
You don't?
Mm-mmm.
I don't want to work
in a record store my whole life.
Yeah? What do you
want to be a doctor?
Oh, God.
TEACHER:
Okay, let's go,
everybody.
Get in your lines, please,
thank you!
Fulmeister.
Here.
Besset!
Basono!
Goulong.
Oh, look, watch out.
Ooh.
Deeds!
Do we smell bad,
or something?
:
Hey, Benny.
Fox.
Penfield.
I hope they shrivel
up and fall off.
Okay.
What was that, Miss Hoeman?
Um.
I said, I hope they shrivel up
and fall off.
You hope what shrivels up
and falls off?
Her breasts, Miss Dietz.
Shut up!
I'm sorry.
You are out of here,
Hoeman.
Right.
Bye-bye.
Bye, girls.
So, uh,
do you share
your partner's attitude?
No, I don't.
:
Eat shit!
Excuse me, Miss Dietz.
You've only got a couple
of months left.
You're doing extremely well
in your courses.
And I think
your chances
of getting a scholarship
are excellent.
I know this, Mr. Donnelly.
Why are you in here now?
I don't know.
I guess I just got
a little fed up.
With what?
The way that we get treated.
Look, uh...
you're getting
a top-notch education here,
and I just don't want
to see you throw it away.
I'm getting a better education
than I deserve.
I'm lucky.
I'm fortunate
that the good people
of this community allow me
to attend this school.
Again,
you are misunderstanding me.
No, I understand everything,
Mr. Donnelly.
I don't need
to have it explained to me.
I live it.
It's just sometimes
I get a little upset
and I lose my temper.
I just don't like to see
my friends getting dumped on
and punished
for defending themselves.
Well, uh, we'll just forget
about this whole thing, okay?
Okay.
What about Jena?
She's off, too.
Thank you.
Andie...
if you put out signals that
you don't want to belong,
people are going to make
sure that you don't.
That's a beautiful theory.
Andie, Andie,
Andie, listen.
I heard what happened and,
and I came as fast as I could.
I cut out of home ec
and everything.
Was, was it really bad?
No, it was nothing.
Are you upset?
No, I'm not.
No-- yes,
yes, you are.
I can tell; your eyes get
all squinty and everything.
Listen, I know just what to
do to make you feel better.
I feel fine.
I want to take you
away this weekend.
Do you fish?
Okay, then we
can go right now.
I have class.
Tonight at 7:00 and I won't
take no for an answer.
Try, please.
This woman is suffering inside.
That's all there is to it.
Yo, man, next time
I'll kick your ass.
Dat'll be dat.
Dat'll-- I'm just kidding;
that's-- it's a joke.
How about
that stock market?
My broker is E.F. Hutton, and
E.F. Hutton says...
You see,
it never works.
It never works.
I've never seen that work...
DUCKIE: Oh, shit!
GIRL:
What's going on out there?
Aah...
So this is what
it looks like.
This is great.
Hey, wait a minute,
wai-w-w-w-wait.
You got doors on the
stalls, they're not stopped.
Wait a minute.
We don't have none of
this stuff in the boys'--
wait a minute, we
don't got none of this.
We don't got doors on the
stalls in the boys' room.
We don't have-- what
is this, what?
We don't have a candy
machine in the boys' room.
We don't got none of that.
GIRL: I'm gonna start screaming
in a minute if you
don't get out of here.
I'm sorry, no, I want
the principal here.
I want him here
this instant.
I want-- now,
this instant.
I'll wait.
Thank you.
Oh, shit!
Why can't I do this?
What have you done?
This-- you have
to subtotal first.
I tell you this
every time.
You never listen.
One more tune, then it's off to
enjoy a terrible relationship.
The furrier next door
loves this.
* Soft words
* They are spoke so gentle,
yeah *
* It makes it easier
* Easier to bear
* You won't regret it, no, no
* Them young girls,
they don't forget it *
* Love
* Is their whole happiness
* Yeah
* But it's all so easy
* All you got to do is
* Try, try a little...
* Tenderness
* Yeah, oh,
you got to do it, man *
* Hold her where you want her
* Squeeze her, don't tease her
* Never leave her
* Give to her
* Got, got to try
a little tenderness *

to love her, man *

* You got to love, squeeze,

* Love her long...
:
Evening, young ladies.
This is a very
good tune.
My mother used
to sing this.
This is Otis;
I love Otis.
We're closed.
You know what an older
woman does for me?
Changes your diapers?
Touche.
No, seriously though, you're
a very smoky alternative,
but this is the Duck
Man's love in life.
Shall we?
You ever had one
of these?
I don't think so.
Come on... let's plow.
:
Do I offend?
Andie, hon.
Listen, it's after 7:00.
Don't waste good lip gloss.
I know, Iona.
I mean, I don't mean
to be a bitch or anything,
but I don't think
Mr. Wonderful is going
to happen tonight.
I don't know
what I'm doing.
Wishful makeupping.
Come on.
Wait, wait.
You babes are, like,
talking a sign language
that the old Ducker here
just does not understand.
Now, would you mind
filling me in here?
I'm a little confused.
She got stood
up, twerp.
Stood up?
Wait, h-how so? Wait, I'm here.
I mean, is this like one of
those feminine mystique deals
or something?
He showed.
Um...
Andie.
I'll get that.
Duckie,
I'm really sorry.
What, is this,
um, you're gonna,
you're gonna go
out with this guy?
I mean, is this, you know,
like, a date, or something?
Yeah.
I mean,
you'll like him.
He's not like the other guys,
seriously.
No, n-no way, Andie!
You really piss me
off, you know, 'cause,
'cause you know they shit all
over everybody, including you.
I just-- I can't believe
you'd be this stupid.
Who's shitting on me?
I'm not gonna let anybody shit
on me.
He's just-- he's gonna use
your ass and throw you away.
God, I would have died for you.
So what am I supposed to do?
He asked me out and I like him.
If I hate him
because he's got mon--
just listen to me-- if I hate
him because he's got money,
that's the exact same thing as
them hating us because we don't.
Do you understand?
You can't do this
and, and respect yourself.
Y-You, you... you can't.
Well, I'll make that decision,
all right?
Sure, you c--
you can do what you want.
You know,
you're talking like that
just because I'm going out
with Blane.
Blane?
His, his name is Blane?
Oh... that's a major appliance,
that's not a name.
Just because I'm going out
with Blane doesn't mean
I can't be friends with you.
I mean, it doesn't change
the way I feel about you.
Oh, that's very nice.
I'm, I'm glad.
Here's... here's the point,
Andie.
I'm n--
I'm not particularly concerned
with whether or not you like me.
'Cause I live to like you
and, and,
and I can't like you anymore.
So, so when you get your heart
splattered all over hell
and, and you're feeling
really low and dirty,
don't, don't look to me
to help pump you back up,
'cause, 'cause, 'cause,
'cause maybe for the first time
in your life, I won't be there.
I can't believe
you're actually saying this.
Well, I guess
that's just tough shit.
Sorry.
Sorry.
That guy in the store.
Oh, he was
a friend of mine.
I've known him
since I was a kid.
He's a really nice guy.
Yeah?
Yeah, I like him a lot.
So you want to go
home and change?
I already did.
Sorry.
No, that's okay.
Oh, boy.
So, where are we going?
You up for a party?
Yeah? No? Maybe?
No, I don't think so.
Why?
"Why?"
Come on, they're my
friends, it's okay.
That's it;
they're your friends.
I wouldn't take you
if I didn't think
they'd accept you.
Can't we just go
somewhere else?
Hey, Andie,
I like you.
I think you like me.
I mean, we both know there's a
lot of bullshit that goes on,
but if you're above
it, I'm above it.
If we want to make anything
out of this whatever,
we got to deal
with it, right?
Yeah.
Come on, I got as
much to lose as you.
We can go out with your
friends if you want.
Go crawl under a rock.
Anything you want.
The choice is yours.
We can go hang gliding.
You like hang gliding?
I've never been
hang gliding.
Well, first
for everything.
If it's a bad time, we leave.
*
MAN :
It's time for more beer!
Hi, Blane.
Hey, Eddie.
Hey, see
you later.
Hey, what's up, bro?
Hey, aren't you the girl
in my art class?
Nice pearls.
This isn't a dinner party,
honey.
Watch it.
Hey, Blane,
how you doing?
Hey, Kev, what's up?
* So I keep believing
* That you and I
can change the world *
* I'm going 'round and 'round,
'round again *
* I say things
that I really shouldn't say *
* I'm going 'round,
'round again *
I can't believe I actually
associate with these people.
I can't believe
that I'm actually here.
Pretty bad, huh?
Yeah, it's pretty bad.
I'm sorry.
Hey, let's go upstairs,
huh?
Look, I didn't come here
to get you off, okay?
That was not my idea.
Andie.
Come on,
that is not what I meant.
I haven't even tried
to kiss you, have I?
Look, it's quieter
up there, okay?
Come on.
These hands will remain in
these pockets, I swear to God.
Look at me here.
Come on.
I'm utterly defenseless.
And utterly foolish.
Come on.
So what do you think
of these carpets, huh?
Utterly fab.
It's going to be good.
Oh, hey, Blane.
Steff.
How're you doing?
All right...
no, I'll get another room.
No, no, no, no, come on in.
I'm watching some tunes here.
So... who you got
with you here, Blane?
Uh, Andie, this is
Steff; Steff, Andie.
Oh, it's very nice
to meet you, Andie.
Ah, listen, uh, you want
to come in and s-sit down?
Or you want the bed,
is that it?
No, no.
We're fine.
At least come in
and have a drink.
Let's go.
Can I get you something?
I mean, this is my last
serious party of my
high school career.
I hope you guys are
gonna tough it out
until Sunday,
at least when
my folks get home.
I think this one may
just finally kill the old
son of a bitch, Blane.
Another giant step away
from virginity I went.
You are a slut,
aren't you, Benny?
:
Oh, my God.
Am I having a nightmare?
We've got guests.
BENNY:
I know you.
You're in my calculus class.
Gym.
Your name's Jim?
You are worthless,
aren't you?
You and your friends gave me
a lot of shit the other day.
Everybody gives you shit.
Take it easy, Benny, huh?
This is Steff's party, Blane.
Don't tell me what to do.
Steff.
I mean, you shouldn't be allowed
to invite just anybody.
Steff, she's going
to ruin my night.
Shut up, Benny!
You're a faggot, Blane.
All right, okay,
listen, Benny...
Why don't we just...
Where are you going?
Let's just leave them
with the room, okay?
Why?
And we will get you
something to eat, all right.
Oh, you've got what I want.
Some ribs, or something.
Listen, you guys, enjoy
yourselves, and, uh...
we'll see you later, maybe.
BENNY:
I doubt it.
STEFF:
You all right?
Fine. You're an asshole.
All right.
I don't want
to know what you are.
I'm gonna take her
to throw up somewhere.
Listen, enjoy yourself.
They're kind of jerks
when they drink, huh?
Bad idea.
Can you just get me
out of here now?
Yeah.
Look, I don't want
to take you home.
I mean, I'd like
to be with you.
If not here, somewhere else;
anywhere you want.
I'm sorry.
What can I say?
I made a mistake.
I overestimated my friends.
I'm sorry.
What, you want to hit me?
Yes, I do.
Be my guest.
* Grow up
* My good beliefs
say to me, stand up *
* Like a real man is
supposed to be, rave up *
* Rest of all
your fantasies, rave up *
* It's just a dream...
You want to know my thing?
If I really have it
solid for a girl,
I'll ride by her
house on my bike.
I'll do it like...
like a hundred times in a day.
It's really-- it's intense.
You ever park?
I'm kind of a drive-by
kind of guy.
* Rave up
* 'Cause being down
ain't being a rat's head up *
* So fool those rats
another time, rave up... *
You want a drink?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Coke.
Coke? Coke, okay.
Give me your address.
I'll, I'll put you on my route.
Okay, you're gonna have
to help me out here.
You know, you know, someday
that girl's going to realize
just what she missed.
Come on, don't stop,
give me more!
Yeah!
Hi!
IONA:
Hi!
Prince Charming whimp out?
No, no, he's
at the bar.
Duckie?
He's sulking.
He's not gonna ride his bike
past your house anymore.
Duckie, you're being
a real jerk.
How'd he get in here anyway?
I said he was my kid.
How come you're here?
I've been trying
to figure that all night.
* You lost a lot
when you lost me *
Sorry.
Mom make this for you?
Yeah. Gross, huh?
* You lost a lot
when you lost me *
* Six paperback books
and a dime tree *
* You lost a lot when you lost
me, six paperback books... *
Hi.
Hi.
Here you go.
Thanks. You met Iona,
didn't you?
Not formally.
Hi, Blane.
And, um, that's
Duckie Dale over there
behind the glasses.
Hi, Duckie.
Philip F. Dale to you, scum wad.
So where you guys been?
Oh, a friend of mine
was having a party.
Oh, how adorable.
Yeah, it was a little intense.
DUCKIE:
Oh, wait, wait,
you had an intense party?
No, it was a friend
of mine's, I said.
Duckie... shut up!
What's the problem?
This is a classic,
classic piece of work here.
Duckie, please...
Phil.
BLANE:
Hey, Phil, I think
you're making Andie
uncomfortable.
Why don't you just knock it off?
What's the problem?
I devoted my life to the girl,
and this guy, he comes
in one day and-and-and thinks
he knows her, that's funny.
You should give
David Letterman a ring sometime.
I'm sure he'd book you
in a minute.
Phil, would you
like us to leave?
You know,
that's very perceptive.
Come on.
:
And look at the manners
on this guy; this was a treat.
Really, thanks a million.
You're a great couple
of kids, really.
You know, I can't believe
I actually felt bad
for you tonight,
retarded, little dwarf.
See you.
Nice meeting you.
See you later.
Sorry.
No problem.
:
No problem.
You're an asshole.
Hey, blow me, butt wad.
Coming from you, I take
it as a compliment.
Andie! Yo!
You been replaced.
Gee, I'm...
I'm sorry.
Well, what now?
I gotta get up early.
Why don't we
just forget it.
What, home?
Hey, you want to go
to my house?
No, thanks.
You want to eat?
No.
What do you want to do?
Anything.
Um... why don't you just
drop me off at Trax.
You know,
I can, I can...
Trax?
It's real close
to where I live.
Well, it's late;
I'll just drop you home.
You want to go home,
I'll drop you home.
No, but I have something
I have to do there.
Now? Come on, it's late.
You want to go home,
I'll drop you home, it's fine.
I don't want you
to take me home.
Okay, let's go out.
No, I don't want...
We'll go out,
anywhere you want,
anything you
want to do.
I don't want to go out.
You don't want to go out,
you don't want to go home.
What do you want to do, Andie?
I don't want you
to take me home.
Wait, I'm missing something.
I'm not a jerk here.
I don't understand
what you're saying.
Wait a minute.
Let's go.
Don't walk away.
Wait a minute.
I'm talking to you.
No. Just please, I just
don't want you...
Why?
Don't you understand me?!
No, I don't... at all.
Will you listen to me?
I don't want you
to take me home.
Okay, why?
What is the problem?
Because I don't want you
to see where I live, okay?
What?
I'm sorry, forget it.
It's okay.
:
Jesus Christ.
I'm really sorry
for bumming out
the night for you.
You didn't bum out anything,
I had a great time.
You liar.
I was with you.
I had a great time.
If I was in a Turkish prison,
I'd have a great time with you.
I don't know, it's just...
It's too weird for me, you know?
Maybe this shouldn't happen.
What, you and me?
Well, you know, maybe it
doesn't happen all the time,
it doesn't mean it
isn't right. Right?
Doesn't mean you can't try.
Would you feel any better
if I asked you to the prom?
I mean, I know the
prom's kind of lame,
so if you don't want to go,
it's really no big deal.
Hey. What?
It happened!
He asked me.
And?
I accepted!
Well, congratulations.
No more moping around
the house waiting
for the telephone to ring?
So... you in love?
Yeah, I think I am.
Well, who is this guy?
His name is Blane.
And he's a senior,
he's so beautiful.
Um, he's a... richie.
A whatie?
A richie, it's kind of stupid.
It's just his family
has a lot of money.
Oh, well, is that a problem?
I don't know, it's just weird.
You know, his friends
have a lot of money,
and he has a lot of money.
He drives a BMW.
I don't know, I'm not really
sure if they're gonna accept me.
Well, what does that mean?
I mean, you like him,
he likes you.
What his friends think shouldn't
make any difference.
Yeah, but it's not just his
friends, it's my friends, too.
It's everybody. I'm just not
real... secure about it.
Well, so take the heat.
I mean, you like him,
he likes you; it's worth it.
Is it?
Well, isn't it?
You're right.
I'm just overreacting,
aren't I?
Oh, not necessarily.
I mean, a good kiss
can scramble
anybody's brain.
Look, just don't worry
about it, you know?
And wait and see
how you feel tomorrow.
Good night, hon.
Good night. Thanks.
That's my baby.
Uh, honey.
Uh, would you-- wait a minute.
Could-could I ask you something?
Yeah.
Uh... sometimes
I feel a little sorry
that, um, I'm the one you have
to talk to about these things.
I'm not.
She couldn't have said it
any better than you.
I mean it.
Good night.
Okay, make my day.
I want all the gory details.
The mingling breath,
the pounding heart,
the steamy windows.
I want the whole scoop.
Well, I hate to
disappoint you,
but nothing happened.
Nothing?
Well, not nothing,
I mean, I kissed him.
Anywhere interesting?
Oh, please.
So...
uh...
does he have strong lips?
How can you tell?
Do you feel it in your knees?
I felt it everywhere.
Strong lips.
Talk about lips.
I mean, I'm old enough
to be his mother,
but when the Duck laid
that kiss on me
last night,
I swear
to God, my thighs just went up
in flames.
He must practice on melons,
or something.
This your prom dress?
Believe it or not.
It's great.
It's silly.
It's great material.
You know, I'm going...
to prom.
Stop it!
:
Well, I am.
Last night he asked me.
And I don't know, I said yes.
It's really weird.
But it might be kind of fun.
IONA:
You were here
for 15 minutes
and you didn't
even tell me!
ANDIE:
Oh, but I really,
really wanted to go.
You lucky girl.
* Cherish is the word I use
to describe... *
Isn't that a dreamy dress?
* All the feeling
* That I have hiding here
for you inside *
* You don't know
how many times I've wished *
* That I had told you
* You don't know
how many times I've wished *
* That I could hold you...
Iona, I have to go.
Can you just hold
till this song is over?
But I have to leave.
Oh, why can't we start old
and get younger?
* Cherish is the word...
I envy you.
I really envy you!
Iona, you're gonna
O.D. on nostalgia.
I loved
"The Big Chill".
I love this dress.
It's a great dress.
Yeah.
My mother bought it
for me.
God, she was so happy.
It was the first
and last time
I ever looked normal.
I mean, you know,
relatively speaking.
It would have been
a fairy tale
if my date hadn't been
the only one at the prom
with a...
wife and two kids.
You want to try it on?
I bet it'd look great on you.
I mean, your butt is
I mean, I used to
have a great butt.
I did!
I loved my butt!
I wish I had photographs
of it.
You want to try
this on?
Mm, nah, not right now.
Oh, yeah,
you gotta go, I know.
I know.
I gotta get ready myself.
You're going out?
Yeah.
New guy.
Terrance,
he owns a pet shop.
We'll see
what happens.
Have fun.
Give Mr. Perfecto
a squeeze
for me.
Oh, I will.
Hey, listen, uh,
if you see your
little Duck Man...
be kind.
He's nursing some
fairly serious wounds.
Okay?
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Hey, you know, we're going
for, uh, sushi.
Do you think this is too much?
Bye.
* You don't know how many times
I've wished that I... *
Thought that was very
uncool of you
last night,
Blane.
What?
What?
You mean Andie?
Yeah, I mean Andie.
What's the big deal, I like her.
As a matter of fact,
I was pissed off at you guys
for being so nasty
to her.
It was way out of order
for you to foist her
on the party.
Steff, do you hear yourself?
You hear the same asshole shit
I hear?
What, do I have to spell it out
for you, Blane?
I guess so.
Nobody appreciates your sense
of humor, you know.
As a matter of fact, everybody
is just about to puke from it.
You know, if you've
got a hard-on
for trash, don't
take care of it
around us, pal,
all right?
Right, buddy.
Listen,
I don't need a lot
of shit on this one, Blane,
all right? I really don't.
Money all that matters to you?
Wh-Where in the hell does
that come from?
Well, look around you, would I
treat my parents house like this
if I, if money was any
kind of issue?
Well, wh-why are
you doing this?
You know, why don't
you just nail her
and get it
over with.
You know, why are
you getting involved?
Is there something wrong
with that?
I just think it's stupid.
You know, it's pointless.
you know, and
your parents,
I think they'll
be thrilled.
They have nothing to do with it.
Really?
Yeah.
I've seen your mother go to work
on you, Blane.
You know, it's vicious!
And when Bill and Joyce
get through with you,
you won't know
whether to shit
or go sailing.
Listen, I, I'm getting really
bored with this conversation.
All right, Blane.
You know, if you want your
little piece of low-grade ass,
fine, take it,
you know,
but if you do,
you're not gonna
have a friend.
Is that right?
Yeah, that's right.
I mean, if you want
to make the choice,
go ahead and make
it, all right?
I, I personally wouldn't trash
a friendship over it,
but... hey,
I'm old-fashioned.
So...
Why don't you take a shower;
you look like shit.
ANDIE:
Two weeks ago,
if somebody told me
that I'd be going out with you,
I never would have
believed them.
BLANE:
Why?
I'm not all that bad.
No, but...
What about me and you?
You know, it's so insane
that somebody
you've never met,
never talked to
can be your enemy.
Mm... yeah.
You shouldn't meet
my parents, then.
Okay.
Well, I mean,
they're not ogres, but...
I think they still believe
in arranged marriages.
Corporate families replaced
royal families.
I'm the crowned prince
of McDonnough Electric.
It's irrelevant.
No.
Yeah.
I could just tell them all
to go to hell.
Tell them to go to hell.
Everyone, friends,
parents.
All of them.
All of them.
What about you?
Hmm?
Somebody doesn't
believe in me, I...
I can't believe in them.
You don't lie, do you?
I don't have to lie.
This is gonna happen.
Okay, I really want this
to happen.
Yeah.
* So, please, please, please
* Let me, let me, let me
* Let me get what I want...
Can I help you?
I'm fine, thank you.
Something for the prom?
Just looking.
Yeah, well, if you
need anything, uh...
This is trash.
MOTHER:
It's very becoming.
Mother, it looks
like I should be standing on top
of a wedding cake.
Oh, darling,
don't I wish.
And I hate
this material
and by the way, I cannot
stand baby blue.
Well, do you know where he is?
WOMAN:
No, I'm sorry,
he didn't tell me
where he was going.
Okay, well, then if he calls
or comes home
can you just tell him
to call me?
Who is this, please?
Andie.
Who?
Andie!
Well, yes,
could I have your number?
Yeah, no, he has the number.
Well, fine,
I'll leave him a note, dear.
Okay, thanks. Bye.
Where in the hell is he?
Never fall in love, Ace,
you just won't like it.
It's very complicated.
Andie?
Andie!
Andie.
Come in.
Hi.
Hi, Daddy.
I brought you
something.
What is it?
Well, it's a little
something I picked up
for you.
* Ta-tah.
I know it's a
little busy,
but I know you can make
something out of it.
If you need to.
Wow.
Yeah.
Do you like it?
It's a beautiful color.
Yeah.
It's really pretty.
God, it reminds me so much
of your mom.
You know, she
always wore pink.
And she looked
so beautiful in it.
It's okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
Daddy.
What?
I just want you to know
I really appreciate this.
I think I can make
something out of it.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
What?
Where'd you get the money
to pay for this?
Well, why, it wasn't that much.
I had some money.
From your new job?
Ah, yeah, from my new job.
I came home before work
on Wednesday
and your car was
in the driveway.
Mm-hmm.
You know,
you didn't have to lie to me.
Yes, I did.
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
I had a line on something
and I missed the
appointment.
Oh, why'd you miss
the appointment?
It slipped my mind.
It didn't slip your mind.
You didn't want the job.
You just went to the counselor
because I forced you to.
Am I right?
Yeah, what's your point, Andie?!
My point is, you just didn't go!
You saying I deliberately missed
the appointment?
Yes.
Is this how you feel about me?
Yes.
Well, I didn't know this.
Well, now you do.
Oh, you know everything,
now, huh?
You're 18
and you got a
scholarship
and, uh,
you're, uh,
That's not fair!
all grown-up and free,
and I'm just an ignorant
son of a bitch who never
gave you anything.
Hey, I never asked
Oh, that's brilliant!
Why can't you just forget her?!
It's late; you got school.
No, don't walk out
on this!
Will you please just
listen to me?!
Please?!
I've already been
through this, Andie!
Sure, you go through
it every day!
You're still
going through it!
Why can't you just
realize that she's gone
and she's not
gonna come back?!
She's never
coming back!
Shut up!
Dad...
Goddamn it!
why can't you
accept it?!
She's just gone!
She...
Why can't you accept it?
Because... I love her.
That's why.
Well, I loved her,
too, you know.
She just didn't
love us back.
Okay, she tried.
I don't know.
She just couldn't handle it.
Yeah, but I...
I-I knew it.
I knew it all along.
I mean, when I was five,
I felt it.
Remember when she didn't
come home that time?
I knew it then,
I knew why.
I was 14, and I knew it.
You were 50,
and you didn't.
You know, you can't go on
living every day in the past.
She left us, Daddy.
We didn't leave her.
There was nothing
we could do about it.
It just happened.
Since when is the
daughter supposed
to know more
than her father?
I've just been
a blind fool.
And you're a blind fool
that needs a shave, too.
And I need a shave.
Well...
You'd better get to bed.
You got school.
And I got to hit
the hay, too,
'cause I got a few things
that I got to do tomorrow.
Okay?
Okay.
Uh, I would have
got you some shoes,
but I didn't know your size.
*
*
How you doing?
How you doing?
Why haven't
you called me?
Oh, I got nailed for
the stable thing.
I guess a groom saw us.
It's against club rules.
I called you three times,
and I left messages.
Yeah?
Well, I-I didn't
get them. My family,
they're very irresponsible
about that stuff, you know?
I waited for you
this morning.
Yeah? Where?
Parking lot.
I saw you, and I thought
that you saw me.
No.
What about prom, Blane?
Oh, Andie, I'm
having a bad day.
Can we talk later?
No. What about prom?
Come on.
Why don't we just
meet after school?
No! What about prom?!
Andie, come on.
Just say it.
What?
Just say it!
I want to hear you
say it.
BLANE:
Andie, please,
all right?
I want to hear you say it.
A month ago, I asked
somebody else,
and I forgot.
You're a liar!
You're a filthy,
fucking, no-good liar!
You don't have the guts
to tell me the truth!
Just say it!
I'm not lying.
Tell me!
What?
Tell me!
What do you
want to hear?!
Just tell me!
What?!
You're ashamed
to be seen with me!
No, I am not, I am not!
You're ashamed
to go out with me!
You're afraid.
No, I'm...
You're terrified
your Goddamn rich
friends won't approve!
Just say it!
Just tell me the truth!
You don't understand it.
It has nothing at all
to do with you.
Andie!
Andie?
Forget about it, man.
It's not worth getting upset
over it, you know?
BLANE:
Ah, why don't you just
take off, Steff, please?
Well, listen, any girl
that did that to me,
I would not be too jazzed
to hold on to, Blane.
It's not worth it, man.
I told you,
it wasn't gonna work, you know.
The girl was, is and
will always be nada.
You got a
problem, friend?
Come on.
All right, all right!
Nice, huh?
* She was a showgirl
* With yellow feathers
in her hair *
* And a dress cut down
to there *
* She would merengue
IONA:
* And do the cha-cha
IONA:
Cha-cha!
Andie?
* And while she tried
to be a star... *
Yeah?
You're Andie,
aren't you?
Yeah, I am.
Uh, how do you know me?
Well, Iona told me.
I'm Terrance. Terry.
* They were young
and they had each other... *
Oh, the pet shop, right?
Yeah, among other things.
She's in the bedroom
getting ready.
You might want to go
in there and tell her
to shake her tail
feather; we're late.
Okay.
* At the Copa, Copacabana
Iona?
* Music and passion
were always the fashion *
Nice to meet you.
* At the Copa
* They fell in love
* Copa *
IONA:
* Copa
* Cabana, a yellow feather
* She was a show girl
Iona?
IONA:
Hi, honey.
I'm in here.
Laugh, and I'll deck ya.
What happened?
Either it's all those drugs
I took in the '60s,
or I am really in love.
What do you think?
Honestly.
Honestly, I think
you look great.
Oh, I look like a mother.
No. Well,
yeah, a little,
but that's okay.
You look happy.
I am.
It's weird, but I...
Did you meet him?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's a yuppie,
but he's so nice.
He's employed,
he's heterosexual.
I swear to God,
I'm so far ahead of the game,
next time you see me,
I'll probably be
picking out
my china patterns.
Hey, are you all right?
No, you're not.
What...
What, I blow your mind? No?
No, that's not it.
It's boy trouble?
The worst?
Way beyond.
He backed out on me.
He said he asked somebody
else, and he forgot about it.
I can't believe it,
I can't believe it.
I'm so humiliated.
I could have killed
him! I swear!
You know, I just
walked right into it.
I know, I know.
Oh, love is awful,
isn't it? Oh.
It's okay.
You remember when I...
and when you said
that-that, um,
if I wanted your prom
dress, I could have it?
Mm-hmm.
Well, I need it.
I want it.
What for?
I just need it.
Okay.
It's yours.
*
*
*
*
Oh, God,
look at you.
Another first.
Your guy's going to fall through
the floor when he comes in.
No, he won't.
The hell he's not.
No, he really won't.
He's not coming.
What?
It's okay.
I'm gonna go.
Alone?
Yeah, I'm not sad about it.
I'm not hurt.
I mean, you know,
I am hurt a little bit,
but I know if I don't do it,
I'll just feel a lot worse.
I'm just gonna go in,
walk in, walk out,
and come home.
You sure?
I just want to let them know
that they didn't break me.
* If you leave,
don't leave now *
* Please don't take
my heart away *
* Promise me
just one more night *
* And we'll go
our separate ways *
* We've always had
time on our sides *
* Now it's fading fast
Open up.
* Every second, every moment
* We've got to,
gotta make it last *
* I touch you once,
I touch you twice *
* I won't let go at any price
STEFF:
Well, as soon as
anybody's ready to go
upstairs and get serious,
just let me know.
We've only been
here an hour.
Well, we can go up
and come back down
again, Benny, all right?
Did you look
at the suite?
STEFF:
It's 300 bucks
a night, Benny.
It's not gonna be
a palace, okay?
I think we should
stay for a while.
We're not gonna see these
people for much longer.
Come on, it's kind
of the end, okay?
STEFF:
I don't give a
shit what you do.
* I'll be running
the other way... *
Oh, damn.
My God.
You're here!
What happened?!
Well, uh, guess
you're looking at it.
Oh, wow, you look great.
Thanks, you, uh,
you look stunning.
Really, it's, it's,
it's breathtaking.
No, and listen,
I want you to know,
despite my appearance at
this function, I remain now,
and will always
be, a Duck Man.
May I admire you?
Oh, uh, if, if you wish.
Let's plow.
*
* Oh-oh-oh
* Oh-oh-oh
* Oh-oh-oh
* Oh-oh-oh
* Oh-oh-oh
* Oh-oh-oh
* Oh-oh-oh
* Oh-oh-oh
* I need you now
like I needed you then *
* You always said we'd still
be friends someday *
* If you leave, I won't cry
* I won't waste one single day
* But if you leave,
don't look back *
Should we dance?
It wouldn't be unheard of.
* Seven years
went under the bridge *
* Like time standing still...
A little, uh, lingering
doubt perhaps, pal?
You know, you gotta
give her credit, though.
I mean, after
you dumped her,
she certainly went out
and found herself what
I'd have to say is
probably the most
interesting date that
her generation...
Steff.
You buy everything, Steff.
You couldn't buy her, though.
That's what's killing
you, isn't it?
Steff.
I don't want to
listen to this.
That's it, Steff.
She thinks you're shit.
And deep down,
you know she's right.
Hi.
Hi.
You don't need me
to say I'm sorry.
It's done. It's over with.
I'm fine.
* You always said...
Oh, well, if that's true,
then I'm glad.
* ...we'd meet again
* Someday
It's not true.
It doesn't matter, does it?
You told me you couldn't believe
in somebody
who didn't believe in you;
I believed in you.
Always believed in you.
Just didn't believe in me.
I love you.
* I need you now
like I needed you then *
* You always said
we'd meet again *
Always.
Andie.
He came here alone.
Okay, you're right.
He's not like the others.
If you don't go to him now,
I'm never gonna take you
to another prom ever
again, you hear me?
I mean, this is
an incredibly romantic moment
and you're ruining it for me.
* I touch you twice,
I won't let go at any price *
Thanks, Duckie.
Go ahead.
* We'd meet again someday...
Blane?
* Oh-oh-oh
* Oh-oh-oh
* Oh-oh-oh
* Oh-oh-oh
* Oh-oh-oh
* Oh-oh-oh
* Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
* If you leave
* Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
* Oh-oh-oh
* Oh, if you leave
* Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
* Oh, if you leave...
