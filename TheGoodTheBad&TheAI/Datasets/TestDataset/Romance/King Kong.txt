No!
Look at me.
Let him go!
You got to run, Jimmy.
Do as I say.
Go with Jack.
Run!
No!
Shoot him!
No!
Here! Over here!
Hold on! Hold on!
Lumpy! Help me!
Bloody hell, Choy!
No!
Oh, my!
Wait!
Carl.
Jimmy. Jimmy.
Jimmy.
You all right?
No.
Get off! Get it off!
Get off!
Get it off!
Kill it!
Stop moving!
Get it off my face!
Stay still.
I am standing still.
Hold on.
Be careful!
Don't move!
Stay away from the walls!
Coming through!
Get out of there now! Climb!
It's beautiful.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
There.
Thank God.
Don't thank God.
Thank Mr. Baxter.
He insisted on
a rescue mission.
Me? I knew you'd be okay.
That's the thing
about cockroaches.
No matter how many times
you flush them
down the toilet...
they always crawl
back up the bowl.
Hey, buddy?
I'm out of the bowl.
I'm dryin' off my wings
and trekkin' across the lid.
Driscoll!
Don't be a fool!
Give it up. It's useless!
She's dead.
She's not dead.
Jack's gonna bring her back...
and the ape will be
hard on his heels.
We can still
come out of this thing okay.
More than okay.
Think about it.
You got a boat
full of chloroform
we could put to good use.
You wanna trap the ape?
I don't think so.
Isn't that what you do?
Live animal capture?
I heard you were the best.
Jack!
Look after yourself!
Keep the gate open, will you?
Sure thing, buddy.
Good luck!
I'm sorry.
Ann.
Jack!
Run!
Jack, Jack!
Jack.
Ann, it's okay.
Ann, let's go.
Let's go. Come on!
Let's go. Come on.
Come on!
Carl!
Please! Somebody help us!
They've gone.
Carl. Christ.
Carl!
Drop the bridge.
Do it now, for Christ's sake!
Not yet.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait!
Come on!
Now!
Throw them!
Throw!
No!
Hold him!
Are you out of your mind?
Stop!
Hold the line!
Keep him down!
Heave!
Please!
No! Stop!
Jack.
No.
Get her out of...
They'll kill him!
There's nothing we can do.
No!
Get her out of his sight!
It's too late.
Throw it!
Look out!
Let go of me.
We gotta go. Come on.
Come on.
Stop it.
Leave me alone!
Ann, please come on.
Kill it!
No. No!
It's over,
you goddamn lunatic!
All of you, run!
Come on. Come on!
Move it! Move it!
Come on, come on!
Stay there!
It's me he wants!
Please stop this!
Move! Hold onto her!
Ann, go.
Please, I can stop this!
No!
Ann, stay there!
Get it out!
Get the hell out of here!
Come on!
Jimmy, don't be crazy!
Come on.
Don't be crazy.
Let me go!
Cast off!
Come on, Carl!
Row!
Wait.
Row, God damn it!
Go back.
Jimmy, no!
No!
No! Don't! Leave him alone!
Hide out in the back!
Wait!
No!
No! No! Please don't!
The whole world
will pay to see this.
We're millionaires, boys!
I'll share it with all of you!
In a few months
his name will be up
in lights on Broadway!
Kong!
The Eighth Wonder
of the World!
What can I say?
What can I say?
Any comments, sir?
The Mayor, thank you.
Ready.
What am I?
Thank you very much.
Get used to it.
Listen, great to see you.
Ready?
I'm really
appreciating that...
Look at you!
I remember you.
You're a lucky guy, Denham.
Am I a lucky guy?
Maybe you're the lucky guy.
Carl!
Zelman!
I told you.
I know you did
and I appreciate it.
Let's get a shot of this.
Come on.
Big smile.
Yeah! That's great!
Look at yourself.
Look at what you've become.
No woman is worth this.
This woman is worth it.
I don't care what it takes,
I gotta win her back.
Oh, really?
She's not gonna buy this
for a second.
Shut up and hand me
the grapefruit!
You're writing a comedy?
Yes, I am.
Why would I write
a play for you?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I couldn't help but overhear.
So, he took me to this
fancy French restaurant...
and halfway through
the hors d'oeuvres,
he clutches my hand.
And that's when he told you
how he felt?
No. He never said it.
He never said it?
He probably thought
he didn't need to say it.
Well, then how does she know
that it's real?
He said it was
not about the words.
Oh, please!
If you feel it, you say it.
It's really very simple.
He said we'd talk
about it later.
Only there was no later.
It never happened.
That's how it ended.
He just let you walk away?
He didn't try to save it?
I honestly believed
things might actually
work out...
which was really very...
foolish.
Men.
Oh, they'll give you
the world...
but they let the one thing
that truly matters...
slip through their fingers.
Typical.
They're so busy being brave,
they forget to use
their brains.
Romance. Who needs it?
##
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I'm here to tell you
a very strange story.
The story of our adventure...
in which 17 of our party
suffered horrible deaths...
their lives lost...
in pursuit of
a savage beast...
a monstrous aberration
of nature.
But even the meanest brute
can be tamed.
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
as you will see...
the beast was no match...
for the charms of a girl.
A girl from New York...
Who melted his heart...
bringing to mind
that old Arabian proverb...
"And lo, the beast looked
upon the face of beauty...
"and beauty stayed his hand.
"And from that day forward,
he was as one dead."
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to show you...
the greatest thing
your eyes have ever beheld.
He was a king in the world
he knew, but he comes to you
now a captive.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I give you Kong,
The Eighth Wonder
of the World!
Don't be alarmed.
It's perfectly safe.
These chains are made
of chrome steel!
Observe, if you will...
I am touching the beast.
I am actually laying my hand
on the 25-foot gorilla.
Crank 'em up, fellas.
And now, we have
in the auditorium tonight...
a surprise guest.
The real-life hero
of this story.
The man who hunted down
the mighty Kong!
The man who risked all
to win the freedom
of a helpless female.
A big hand for
Mr. Bruce Baxter!
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
##
He was right.
About there still being some
mystery left in this world...
and we can all have
a piece of it...
for the price
of an admission ticket.
That's the thing you come
to learn about Carl.
His unfailing ability
to destroy the things
he loves.
Please remain calm,
ladies and gentlemen...
for we now come
to the climax of
this savage ritual.
The sacrifice
of a beautiful young girl.
Behold her terror as she is
offered up to the mighty Kong!
A big hand, folks,
for the bravest girl
I've ever met!
Miss Ann Darrow.
Save me from the beast!
Help me!
Where is she?
Where's Ann?
I have no idea.
I heard he offered her
all kinds of money
and she turned him down flat.
# Pack up all
my cares and woe #
# Where somebody
waits for me #
Here's your story, boys.
"Beauty and the man
who saved her from the beast."
No.
We have to get these people
out of here.
Everyone needs to leave, okay?
Come on.
Let him roar.
It makes a swell picture.
Head for the exits.
Get your own seat, buddy.
You're not having mine.
Excuse me, fellows.
Coming through.
Coming through, fellows.
Get me down! Help me, please!
Somebody! Somebody help me!
Go! Go! Get out!
Go! Go!
There they are.
Go!
Wait for me!
Go back!
This way!
Help!
No!
Taxi! Follow that ape.
Come on, pal,
we gotta draw him off.
It's all yours, buddy.
Hey, get out of here, lady!
Come on.
Buddy!
Come on. Come on.
Look out.
Jesus Christ.
Fire!
Stop!
No. No.
Beautiful.
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Hey! Hey!
Nobody past this point.
You can't go in there!
Hey!
Stop him!
Hey! Get back.
You're not allowed up there!
What's going on?
Go!
No!
No!
Please! No!
No!
Ann. Ann.
Move along.
Just one shot! One shot!
Come, come!
Boys, how about a photo?
Look at me.
Come on, watch the camera.
Come a little closer.
That's it, folks.
Show's over. Step back!
Clear the area. That's it.
Shove off, boys.
Why'd he do that?
Climb up there
and get himself cornered.
The ape must have known
what was coming.
He's just a dumb animal.
Didn't know nothing.
What does it matter?
Airplanes got him.
It wasn't the airplanes.
It was beauty
killed the beast.
