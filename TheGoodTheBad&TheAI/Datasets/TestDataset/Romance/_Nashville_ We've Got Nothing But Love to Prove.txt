- Previously on "Nashville"...
- I tried my best to...
to work around you just
showing up like this.
I think I'm done pretending.
I called Granddad. I'm gonna
stay with him for a while.
You've chosen a lifestyle
my fans have trouble with.
My wife does, too.
I just wanted to clarify a few things.
I made it very clear to
him "Deacon is my guy."
Might be time for y'all
to sign at Highway 65.
With one condition...
that you do it together.
Avery: I want full
custody of our daughter.
I have no idea where Juliette is.
No one's heard from her
in god knows how long!
Finally.
Yes, we just got approval from the city
for our street closures.
Thank goodness. Nothing like
doing it at the last minute.
Were we able to get more shuttles?
Yeah, let's just pray we need 'em.
You don't want Markus taking
the stage to a half-empty lawn.
That's not gonna
happen... right?
- Excuse me, Ms. Jaymes.
- Hey. Yeah.
The segment starts in 15,
and we really need to get
Markus wired for sound.
Oh, I sent him over
like five minutes ago.
I'm sorry. He never showed.
What?
See ya.
So, uh, have fun in Charleston.
- Cool.
- Mwah.
I'll see you when I see you.
That was romantic.
Well, I told you we
were casual.
- Doesn't have to be romantic.
-
Caleb's not picking you up?
Uh, no. Uh, doctor stuff.
He can't get away when
he wants to sometimes.
- Deacon: There she is!
- Yeah.
- Hi!
- Hey.
- Hey, Gunnar!
- Hey, Deac!
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
- Oh, I missed you.
- We missed you.
So glad I got back in time.
Are you kidding? I would've
postponed the whole damn thing.
I'm not gonna open the
Beverly without you.
Hey, you need a ride, Gunnar?
Oh, I'm good. Thanks, man.
Uh, Jesse's giving me a ride.
- All right.
- I'll see you.
Hey, uh, before you go,
I just want to say...
I had a really great time.
I mean, it worked.
We worked.
Of course we did. We're friends.
Yeah. Friends? We're more than friends.
We're partners.
- Partners, okay.
-
- I'll see you at the opening?
- Wouldn't miss it.
Okay, cool.
Follow me out to the sea
I'll chase you if you chase me
Ohhh
Come on, let's go
We'll make up for losing track
Of all the fun we can't get back
Ohhh
Come on, let's go
Hey
Let's go out and play
It's all fun and games
Till the stars come out again
So, what'd you think?
I think it's great. Good job.
You didn't like it.
No, I did.
It's just, you know, now
that we have our look,
maybe we should start
figuring out our sound.
What's wrong with our sound?
If we want to get on the radio,
maybe we should come up with something
that just sounds a little more adult.
But we're not adults.
You're right. Forget it.
Hurry up and eat or we're
gonna be late for school.
Will: Oh, you want to
see some bubbles, Cady?
Hey, Avery, I got to
leave in like 10 minutes.
-
- Avery: I'll be right down.
All right, it's about damn time!
Dang... dang time.
How you been, buddy? Welcome home.
Hey. There's my girl!
Hey, sweetie, remember
me? I'm your uncle Gunnar.
Oh, man, she's getting big!
And I've missed it. Aww!
I'm never touring
again... ever.
Hey, it's Juliette.
Reporter: As we've said before,
"shenandoah girl" has to be
the Cinderella story
for this Oscar season.
Hollywood was skeptical, but
Juliette Barnes was defiant.
Juliette: You know, in a way, I feel
like I've been acting my whole life.
-
- "Juliette Barnes" is kind of a character...
Well, Will look at
this? She knows her mama.
How would she know that?
You guys been showing
her pictures or something?
Okay, first, I just got here. Hi.
And second, babies know
their mother's voice
from in utero.
How would you even know that?
I read stuff.
I take
parenting very seriously.
Look, from now on, Juliette's
off-limits. You got it?
And no more TV.
She's too young.
Actually, he's right about that.
All the books say so.
- Anything?
- Rayna: Well, he left his phone.
I'm not sure if that's a
good thing or a bad thing.
What do we do?
Go see if they'll push the segment,
and then just grab anybody and everybody
- to search the grounds.
- Okay, I'm on it.
Thanks, man. No, I
owe you one, seriously.
Yeah, it's gonna be fun.
All right, bye-bye.
Dierks is gonna cover for Juliette.
Oh, good. That's one fire out.
Now, can I get you to sign off
I already narrowed it down to five.
Thought we agreed we're not gonna use
any of these shots with Colt.
We got plenty without him.
Being a father is part
of what makes you you.
That's why it needs to
be part of the brand.
This brand is why my
son is not talking to me.
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
pour more salt in that wound.
Hey, Luke, there are federal
agents here to see you.
Federal agents?
Um...
Send them in.
- You know anything about this?
- No.
Mr. Wheeler?
Yeah, hi. This is my
associate, Gabriella Manning.
Special Agent Simon.
This is Agent Madsen.
- We're from the I.R.S.
- I.R.S.?
Oh, uh, my business manager
might want to be in on this, then.
Well, actually, that's why we're here.
There's been an ongoing investigation
of Meyer Hoffman & associates,
and I'm afraid you're involved.
Involved how?
Well, Mr. Hoffman has apparently
been embezzling from you
and several other clients.
We've been told by the FBI
that he's fled the country.
Uh, I'm sorry. Where the hell is he?
That doesn't really concern the I.R.S.
Then why are you here?
Mr. Wheeler, you owe the government
$40 million in back taxes.
Hey. You're early. Come on in.
Want some breakfast?
No, thanks. I already ate.
You might have some company today.
Gunnar's back.
He's got about a month's
worth of laundry to do,
so he decided to hit the laundromat.
Okay. Uh...
You know, Cadence really missed
you yesterday. What happened?
Were you sick or something?
I was with Juliette.
And I don't want to lie to you about it.
She's back in town?
No, not yet, but I got a
text from her a few days ago.
Oh, what do you mean a few days ago?
I didn't know if I should tell you.
Of course you should tell me.
I mean, we're... we're friends.
I know, but Juliette's a
friend, too, and she's...
The one who pays your salary?
- Look...
-
...I was skeptical, too.
But it turns out she left
Luke's tour to go into rehab.
And now that she's clean,
she's checked herself
into a treatment center
for postpartum depression.
Avery, she knows she's sick.
And she's working with
this amazing doctor.
No, em, she's manipulating you.
She knows I won't talk to her,
so she's using you to get to me.
No, that's not what she's doing.
- I'm telling you...
- That is exactly what she's doing!
Juliette hates herself
for what she's done,
and... and she's afraid to face you.
You know what? I can't
deal with this right now.
You should leave.
Avery, I'm here to watch Cadence.
Not anymore.
Please go.
Frankie fought me on the pews, but
- man, I just had to have 'em, you know?
- Mm-hmm.
The Ryman, the Bluebird...
all them hallowed places, they got pews.
They treat the music like it's sacred.
- I love the whole thing.
-
Mama would be so proud of you.
Oh, I forgot. I got something
else I got to show you.
Hold on.
Wow, it's beautiful.
Rayna's gonna love it.
Markus?
Markus?!
What's going on?
Everybody's waiting for you.
I can't do this.
This is a... this is a big mistake.
This is a huge mistake. I can't do this.
I'm sorry, Rayna.
This is crazy. I'm not a country singer.
And you're... you're
gonna put me on a stage
in the heart of Nashville.
They're gonna see right through me.
Listen to me.
They're not gonna see through anything.
Markus, this is the best
music you've ever done,
and the country audience
is gonna love you for that.
I mean, hell, I've invested all
this time and money into this.
I believe in you. You
got to believe in you.
Trust me?
When are you gonna ask her?
Well, tomorrow night at the opening.
All our friends and family
are gonna be there...
your mama, too, in spirit.
Yeah.
Seemed like a good time.
Time to start moving forward.
Speaking of which, I
got to get you home.
- Let's go. Come on.
- Oh, there's no rush.
I could, like, stay and
help or hang or... whatever.
Look, I've been on
the road enough to know
that the last place I'd want
to be when I first got back
is anywhere but home.
Something you want to tell me?
Uh, just last time I was home,
things were a little
off between Caleb and I.
That's all.
Re-entry is always tough.
All I can tell you is
the longer you put it off,
the longer it's gonna take for
things to get back to normal.
So, Markus, are you enjoying your time
- here in Nashville?
- Oh, absolutely, Nick.
I mean, this... this is
an incredible music town.
You know, like, the talent
here is... is really insane.
My first week here,
I walk into this club
in printer's alley, you know,
it's midnight on a Tuesday,
and these cats are just
killing it, you know?
And... and the music never stops.
It's like that everywhere,
and I'm... I'm... I'm really in awe.
He would come into the
studio in the morning,
just going on and on
about whatever music he'd
heard the night before.
-
- It really is inspiring,
and I think you feel that
inspiration in the album.
Yeah.
Listen, I'm looking
forward to this record,
but some people are not
taking your little detour
into country music
particularly seriously.
I mean, what do you say,
Markus, to those critics
who think that all of
this... just a bit of a lark?
Well, can I jump in on that, please?
Because that... that makes me crazy
when I hear stuff like that.
These days, there's
not that much difference
between country music
and... and Boulevard.
The lines are really blurred.
Frankly, this is the best music
we've ever heard from Markus Keen.
It's the most authentic,
and all I can say
is everybody can
download the album tonight
and hear for themselves.
Rayna Jaymes, Markus Keen,
thank you very much for
being with us this morning.
And don't forget you
can download Markus'
brand-new album tonight,
starting 8:00 P.M. eastern time.
We can't find any
irregularities with the label
or any Wheelin' Dealin' investments.
But he embezzled from
your personal finances
and tried to cover it up
by filing false returns.
$40 million?
All right, so, how do we handle it?
Honestly?
- Bankruptcy.
-
At least then you could
protect some of your assets.
No, the most important
thing to protect right now
is the brand, and
"bankruptcy" is an ugly word
when it comes to business.
Agreed, but so are "back taxes."
We need to handle this as
quickly and quietly as possible.
Can you pay it, make it go away?
I don't care how rich you are,
nobody's got money like
that just sitting around.
So, what do we do?
Well, with bankruptcy off the table,
I suggest we start liquidating assets,
convert as many as we can into cash.
Do it.
Sell everything and anything
that won't draw attention.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Thought you were working?
I was, but I got Dr.
Kurihara to cover my patients
for the rest of the day.
'Cause I didn't want
to make the same mistake
that I made the last time.
That wasn't your fault. That was mine.
I surprised you, and then
I carried on about it.
Hey, hey, well, let's just forget
about the last time and start over.
I love you.
I love you.
Should I get a restraining order?
No, but you should calm down.
Okay.
If she reached out to Emily,
it's only a matter of time
till she shows up on my doorstep,
and I don't want her
anywhere near Cadence.
And that's your decision to make.
Juliette signed the papers
terminating her parental rights,
and she did so of her own volition.
What if she brings this doctor into it?
What if they try to say
that she was mentally
incompetent or something?
Avery, listen to me.
You have the power in this
situation... all of it.
Are you sure it's not booked?
My publisher was supposed to
call and make a reservation.
I'm really sorry, sir, but I'm
not seeing it in the system.
Could it be under another name?
If it's not under
Cole or Lexington, then...
Hey, Will. You ready to work?
No.
Looks like Casey forgot
to call, so we don't have a room.
Hang on, um...
Let me call my roommate.
I bet you we could use his music studio.
Forget it. Why don't
we go back to the house?
We can work there.
You sure your wife won't mind?
It's fine.
Okay, then. Let's go.
But tonight feels different
Yes, it does, yes, it does
Yes, it does, yes, it does
Yeah! Whoo!
Okay, that's enough rehearsing, guys.
Oh, my God. Y'all, it sounds so good.
Thank you so much. It's
gonna be great tonight.
I tell you what, people are gonna be
talking about this for a long time.
Yeah, but what are they gonna be saying?
Just look at this place.
It's gonna take thousands
of people to fill this space.
What if... what if Nick Watt's right?
What if nobody buys me as a... as a...
this whole country thing?
You're right, that could happen,
but we made a damn good album.
If people don't like it, screw 'em.
I wouldn't do anything different.
This has been one hell
of a ride, hasn't it?
Yeah, it has.
So, let's go down in a blaze of glory.
Let's do it.
- Hell, yeah.
- Hell, yeah.
All right, guys, great job!
You got your hands
in your pocket
-  Boyfriend in your locket
-
Cash. Hey, cash. How you doing?
Deacon!
I thought you were still
on the road with, uh,
Kacey Musgraves, right?
Wait, you opened for Kacey Musgraves?
No, just traveling with
her while we wrote together.
I'm sorry. This is
Maddie. This is Daphne.
Uh, this is cash. This
is Frankie's daughter.
That's probably the coolest
name I've ever heard.
Well, thank you. I was
supposed to be a boy.
Dad named me after Johnny Cash anyway.
Yes, he did.
Uh, well, do you want
to hang out with us?
We're going over to the V.I.P. section.
Yeah, come on.
Yeah, that'd be awesome. Thank you.
- Let's go.
- Yeah.
It's good to see you.
Well, I don't know
when paying $40 million in taxes
has ever been good news,
but... we'll be okay.
It's gonna take a couple of weeks,
but the I.R.S. agreed
to our payment schedule.
And they said they'd keep it quiet.
- Whew.
- Hey.
Come on. Let's go home.
Um, it may be a house, but...
it's no home, not anymore.
Luke, you've got to stop this.
You can't keep punishing yourself.
He won't even talk to me, Gabriella.
I can't just say, "oh, well,"
and move on. He's my son.
I know that, but Colt's
not living on the streets.
He's with family.
He's with my ex-wife's
family, and big surprise...
they don't like me too much.
God only knows what they're telling him.
You're right. I'm sorry.
No, hey...
I'm sorry.
Listen, I'm gonna stay
a little while longer.
How about I just see you tomorrow?
- Sure.
- Okay.
You ready for this?
Yeah.
And you thought nobody
was gonna show up.
Well, I kind of wish they hadn't now.
Oh, my gosh. You're never happy.
All right.
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it.
Thank you for coming out.
You know, one of my favorite
things about this city
is the fact that we know good
music when we hear it, don't we?
And tonight, we have one of the best...
a world-renowned artist who
chose to come here to Nashville.
So, please, would you give
a warm Nashville welcome
to Highway 65's newest artist,
the one, the only Markus Keen?!
Hello, Nashville!
Hold up, what is this feeling?
I can't believe
it's got me dreaming
Colors in my mind
Come on, the clouds are rolling
For us, blue skies are folding
Let's see how many we can find
last night, baby,
that was nothing
Take my hand, I'll
show you something
I can't keep these
feelings that I feel inside
I changed my mind
Oh, tonight, oh, tonight
I feel, I feel alive
You know, I got to admit,
I didn't think he could pull it off.
But he's good.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's good, all right.
Cast aside these broken hearts
Love songs were
never meant for us
But tonight feels different
Yes, it does, yes, it does
Yes, it does, yes, it does
Whoo!
He didn't make you
use the back entrance?
No.
Right through the front door,
just like a normal person,
and he said we could work
at the house from now on.
You know, I really think
I'm starting to change
his mind about things.
You know, if I can get
a guy like Wade Cole
to be more accepting... Who knows?
Maybe there is hope for a
gay artist in country music.
Well, hear, hear.
Hey, where's Emily?
I thought she was coming around today.
She's still not into you
if that's what you're after.
No.
But she's... she's family.
She should come hang with us.
I'll give her a call.
I-I wouldn't do that.
Why not?
Because I fired her.
- What?! Are you serious?!
- You can't fire Emily. She's Emily.
Look, I just found out
that she's been talking to
Juliette behind my back, okay?
And then she had the
nerve to come over here
and try to get me to feel sorry for it.
Emily is supposed to be on our side.
Listen, Avery, I know I've
missed some stuff here,
but don't you think you're
being a little harsh?
No. Look, you guys don't
know Juliette like I do.
that Juliette's using
her to get what she wants,
and that means I can't
trust Emily anymore,
and I don't want her
anywhere near Cadence, okay?
No. It's not okay.
Emily is a way better influence
on Cadence than any of us.
Including you.
Get her back, dude, all right?
Say you're sorry. Admit
you're a crazy person.
Just... just get her back.
So, I got some good news recently.
Hmm?
A job offer.
- Promotion, actually.
- Hmm.
I would be the head
of my own department.
That's incredible! Why
didn't you say anything?
Well, I didn't think I was gonna get it.
When they called, I was shocked.
I'm not. I knew you were amazing.
Well done.
There's a catch.
It's in Seattle.
We live in Nashville.
Um... plenty of country
stars live in other states.
I'm part of a duo, though,
so it's not just about me.
Uh, s-sorry, how would that even work?
Well, I know that I
blindsided you with this, so...
We obviously have some
things to figure out.
Yeah.
So, let's just, let's...
let's sleep on it.
We don't need to
decide anything tonight.
Yeah. Sorry, it's just kind of big.
Oh, no, don't wait up, babe.
I'll be at least another hour here.
I know. I can't wait to see
you when I get home, too.
I love you.
Bye.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Getting some numbers in...
- quarter of a million downloads so far.
- No!
At this rate, we're going platinum.
- Oh, my!
-
Bucky, I am so sorry,
but I got to borrow my
label head for one second.
Wait, what are we doing?
Five minutes... that's all I ask, okay?
- Come on.
- Come on.
What are we doing back up here?
Trust me.
Well, I wanted to take you
back to where it all began,
but I couldn't find a 737, so...
- Aww.
- ...this will have to do.
I want to propose a toast.
To Rayna Jaymes, an
incredible woman who...
saw more in me than
I ever saw in myself.
For that, I'm grateful, really.
Well, thank you.
The album is amazing.
Tonight was incredible!
- I'm gonna drink to that.
- Yeah.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Mmm.
Markus, what the hell?!
Come on, you know we
have chemistry, Rayna.
You cannot do that!
Why? W-what's the big deal?
We talked about this!
If we're gonna work together,
you've got to respect me,
respect my boundaries.
No.
Rayna.
I don't want to leave Nashville.
I know.
Which is why I'm gonna
turn down the job.
Really?
Look, I get it.
You live here. Your friends are here.
Your family's here.
You don't want to leave Nashville.
And I don't want to leave you.
So, I think this is a
pretty easy decision.
Forget I mentioned it.
Time to wake up.
What in the world?
Oh, yeah, somebody has earned
a little breakfast in bed today.
My goodness.
Mm, thank you. What's the occasion?
Are you kidding me? After
last night, uh, my dear,
you are officially Nashville's
hottest label head/producer/
love of my life.
- Oh, my goodness.
- I'm so proud of you.
Thank you.
Did it really happen?
I didn't just dream it?
It happened.
- Honey, it was such a great night.
- It was amazing.
I mean, what a victory
after all that hard work.
I got to say, uh... you were right.
That Markus isn't so bad after all.
Well, I wouldn't go that
far  but...
What does that mean?
Oh, nothing. It does not bear repeating.
Seriously, what?
Well, I mean, after that whole
conversation I had with him,
he still tries to kiss me at
the end of the night last night.
Could anybody be that stupid, you know?
- Where is he, Rayna?
- What do you mean?
What hotel is he at?
Where is he right now?
- Honey, no, no.
- God, Rayna...
- Don't do that.
-
That guy's ass should've
been kicked a long time ago.
Well, that's not gonna
do anybody any good.
- I've got it under control, okay?
-
It doesn't seem like you
have it under control, Rayna!
- What is that supposed to mean?!
- I'm just saying...
- Oh, my God.
- What are you doing?
- No!
- What?
Markus is canceling the
tour and moving to L.A.?
No!
What are you doing?!
Where are you going?!
I've got to talk to him, babe!
You going to talk to Markus
in the middle of a fight about Markus?!
This is not a fight.
He kissed me! I didn't kiss him!
There's nothing for us
to be fighting about.
However, if he cancels this
tour, this album is dead!
Everything, all the
hard work, is pointless,
so, yes, I'm going to go
talk to Markus right now!
Can I help you?
I'm Dr. Kitley, your wife's therapist.
I'd like a few minutes of your time.
I'm sorry you found out the way you did.
There's probably not
a good way to find out
Juliette's trying to worm
her way back into our lives.
You do know that she signed
away her parental rights.
I do.
- But I also know your wife...
- Ex.
...has been ill, and
she's trying to get better.
To have any chance at a full recovery,
she needs to bond with the
child she gave birth to.
That's not gonna happen.
Look, I'm not the enemy here.
I may be working with
Juliette, but believe me,
I'm advocating for your daughter.
Then I hope you feel
comfortable telling her
that when her mother tried to
repair their relationship...
It was her father who said no.
Rayna, hey.
Come on in.
So, this is how you're gonna play it?
Play what?
Why are you canceling the tour?
Oh, Bucky didn't tell you?
Yeah, um, bandmates called
me to congratulate me,
and we started talking, and
one thing led to another,
and now the band's back together.
Seriously? Boulevard just reunited
in the last 10 hours since I saw you?
Yeah, it's crazy, right?
Come on, Markus.
Whatever went down
between us, we can fix.
Don't throw away
everything we've worked for
just 'cause of... some stupid kiss.
Look, Rayna, I'm... I'm sorry, but...
- No.
- ...I got to go.
No, look, we started
this journey together
because you wanted to stand on your own.
You wanted to be heard, you know?
Don't go back from that.
I need this.
Please!
I'm begging you.
Just please.
The story's out. We
lost Ford and Walmart.
It's only a matter of time
before we lose the rest.
Wait, hold on a second.
I thought you said we
had it under control.
after your fight with Colt.
He found out about the taxes somehow.
The piece is gonna be a hatchet job!
No, I paid it all back.
- Did you tell them I paid it back?
- It doesn't matter!
The perception is that Luke
Wheeler is either too dumb
or too rich to notice that
$40 million is missing,
and neither is a good
option for business.
Everything I've done is
to protect this brand!
Hell, I even lost my
own son because of it...
because you keep insisting
that this brand come first!
I mean, you were the one who...
who told us we shouldn't
talk to the police!
You were the one who wanted Colt to lie!
You're telling me it
was all for nothing?!
Don't you dare stand there
It was my job to protect the brand.
And for the record,
your tax problems started
long before we met,
so if anybody has the right
to be angry here, it's me.
I'm the one who bet on the wrong horse.
So, if you'll excuse me, I'm
done cleaning up your messes.
Hey, Deac?
They're getting restless out here.
You still waiting on Rayna?
No. Not anymore.
Thank you very much.
I can't tell you how much it
means to see y'all here tonight.
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the Beverly.
And, yes, this will be one of
the best damn bars in Nashville,
but more than that...
This is gonna be a place for dreamers,
a place where they
can stand on this stage
and sing their songs and
not only find an audience,
but find a home.
That's enough of me talking.
Why don't we get this thing started
by bringing forward some real talent?
Ladies and gentlemen, my
niece Scarlett O'Connor!
- Give her a hand, everybody!
-
Scarlett!
The very first song here...
we'd like to dedicate this one
to, well, our favorite dreamer.
This is for Beverly.
You're carrying a heavy load
Blindfolded on a winding road
Ohhh
Don't know where to go
Let's face it,
we've all been there
Tangled up in our own despair
Too burned out to care
- I'm gonna go get a soda.
- Okay.
Let me give you
something to think about
Maddie! Hey! Hey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You guys playing tonight?
No, this isn't really our crowd.
Why not?
Well, being in a band with
your 12-year-old sister
kind of limits your audience.
Yeah, I guess that might
be a drag sometime, huh?
Yeah.
What kind of music would you like to do?
Your kind of music.
- My... real... Well...
-
...you and me should
write together sometimes.
- Seriously?!
- Yeah!
Yes, that would be awesome.
You've got a hand to hold
You've got a hand to hold
You've got a hand to hold
You do know I still have my key, right?
What do you want?
I heard you saw Dr. Kitley.
Yeah, so?
So, what did you think?
I think that she is a complete stranger
who doesn't realize that
Juliette is capable of
saying anything she has
to in any given situation
to get what she wants.
Come on, Avery. Listen to yourself.
Juliette isn't a monster. She's sick.
This is classic
Juliette... hit rock bottom,
ask for forgiveness,
reel everyone back in,
and then she just jumps
off the rails again,
taking everyone down with her!
Avery, it's different this time.
Look, the treatment
center's only an hour away.
- Go there yourself.
-
Talk to her. You'll see
that she's different.
Hell, she's about to get
nominated for an Oscar
because she's so damn
good at pretending!
You wanted her to admit
she has postpartum. She did.
You wanted her to get help. She has.
At this point, the only
thing holding her back
from getting better is you!
I am trying to protect my daughter.
No, you're protecting
you, and you know what?
That's fine.
Get a divorce, move to a desert island.
You never have to see her again.
But Juliette was, is, and
always will be Cadence's mother.
And there's not a legal
document in the world
that can change that!
Man: The Beverly
presents Tucker Beathard.
Girl, I really did mean it
when I wished you the best
-  Good to hear you're killin' it...
- Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, of course.
And findin' your own
way didn't take too long
Okay, so, this is kind of sudden.
Caleb has been offered a job in Seattle,
and I wanted to tell you
first because we're partners,
and I want to know what you think.
I don't know how you band work
from opposite sides of the country.
That doesn't work. That's crazy, right?
Well, it's, um...
it's not ideal.
But... if it makes you happy,
then, sure, we can make it work.
- How?
- I don't know.
Um... I'll go there sometimes,
or you'll come here, but...
We can do it, Scarlett,
if that's what you want.
Thank you.
Just like you said you would
But I gotta tell
you I can't stand
Sorry to keep you so late.
When my family's out of town,
I just lose all track of time.
That's not a problem.
I think we got some
good stuff out of it.
Oh, yeah, me too.
Hey, why don't I make
up for the long day
and put a couple steaks on the grill?
Maybe we can catch the
last half of that game.
I would love that, but, um,
a friend of mine's
opening up his bar tonight.
I-I got to go.
Yeah, of course.
Maybe next time.
Listen, Will...
I just wanted to tell you that, uh,
I really have enjoyed working with you,
and I know I might've come off a bit...
Judgmental early on, but,
uh, truth is, I admire you.
- A lot.
- Whoa! Whoa! What the...
What the hell are you doing?!
Don't look at me like that.
You got no right to judge.
No, I'm not judging.
I'm just... I'm... I'm...
I'm surprised.
I mean... You're gay?
I mean, how... how have you managed
to stay in the closet
after all these years?
I think I've managed just fine.
I'm one of the biggest-selling
artists of all time.
I got more money than
I could ever spend.
I got a great family.
And you could've had it all, too,
if you'd just figured
out how to play it right.
Yeah, maybe so.
But it turns out...
I'd rather be me than you.
So I'm gonna shoot
this last light out
Get a little lost
before I get found
I'm gonna burn
this last one down
And then turn it around
Before mama and Jesus
Babe...
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I wanted to be here. You know I did.
Do I? How would I know that?
What's that supposed to mean?
You know what it's supposed to mean.
It means you chose him again.
- I chose him?
- Yeah, you chose him,
just like you did every
single time since he got here,
and I thought maybe this big night
might be a little bit different,
but, no, he pitches
a fit, you go running.
Will you stop?
I didn't choose him.
I had to go, Deacon.
Markus left today. I
couldn't talk him out of it.
- Good.
- Good?
-  Yeah, that's good.
- That's...
- That's good for you?
- That's real good, yeah.
Okay, good, good...
'cause my label's dead.
You know how important
this label is to me.
Because you're jealous?
Can't be with you right now.
There you are.
I was wondering w...
Hey, what's the matter?
I feel so guilty.
I asked Gunnar if he thought
we could still do the band
if I moved to Seattle.
And what'd he say?
He said if it made me
happy, we could make it work.
It's
what I couldn't say to you.
Scarlett, we already settled this.
- I'm not taking the job.
- You have to.
You have to. You...
you're brilliant at what you do.
I can't allow you to throw
away everything you've dreamed,
everything you've worked for for me
when I cannot do the same thing for you.
You're breaking up with me?
You deserve someone who
will follow you anywhere.
Well, I should've known better.
The way this
whole thing started,
you needed a doctor to
lean on and not a boyfriend.
If it weren't for Deacon's cancer,
you wouldn't have given a
guy like me a second thought.
-
- I'm not one of you.
I'm too...  normal.
I'm sorry.
I'm very, very sorry.
You can pack your things
when I'm at work tomorrow.
You leave your key by the door.
Thanks for coming over.
To be honest, I wasn't sure you would.
Avery, nothing's changed between us.
I know you think it has, but
I'm still the same person.
I know, and I'm sorry.
It's just...
I'm furious with Juliette,
and I took it out on you.
I get it. You don't trust Juliette.
And given her track
record, I don't blame you.
Juliette has to prove herself,
but she needs Cadence
in order to do that.
Okay, so... How would this even work?
Y-you'd take Cadence over there,
the doctor would supervise the visit,
and then you'd... you'd
bring her right back?
If that's what you want, yes.
You can promise me
that Cadence would
never be alone with her,
that you'd be in the
room the whole time?
I promise.
Okay.
You can tell Dr. Kitley
that I agree to supervised visits,
but the termination of
parental rights stays in effect.
Absolutely.
You're doing the right thing.
Then why do I feel sick to my stomach?
Sarge. I'd like to speak to Colt.
Then you've wasted a trip.
Listen, I didn't... I didn't
come to argue with you.
I just need a minute.
It's okay, Grandpa.
Hey.
Look, I don't know how to say it, um...
but I was wrong, and I'm sorry.
And just... please come home.
No thanks. I'm happy here.
Don't do this. Don't
uproot your whole life
just to get back at me.
Nashville is your home,
not all the way out here.
You don't get it, do you?
What's wrong between us can't be fixed.
Yeah, it can.
'Cause the reasons we
were fighting, Colt,
they don't matter anymore.
Son, the brand is dead,
a-and I never should've gone
down that road to begin with,
and I sure as hell
shouldn't have made it
more important than
you, and I know that now.
So, can we please...
just start over, okay?
I promise you
that I won't make the
same mistakes this time.
Please.
Is the brand really dead?
Yeah, son, it is.
And what about Gabriella?
She's gone, too.
Wow.
I guess you lost it
all then, didn't you?
- Hey.
- Hey.
So, uh, when are you moving?
I'm not. We broke up.
Wow.
Are you okay?
Nope. But I will be.
Scarlett! Hey, welcome home!
Hey! It's so good to see you.
Good to see you, too.
And, you... I'm not letting
you get away this time.
Come here, buddy! Come here!
No! No! No!
Dude, are you drunk already?
No, but good idea.
Could I get three beers, please?
I'm gonna need one of you
guys to drive me home tonight.
Hey, guys.
Hey!
- Avery, what's up, man?
- Hi.
Oh, can we make that four beers?
How are you? I'm good. How are you?
- It's really nice to see you.
- Good to see you.
What are you doing here?
Where's... where's Cadence?
I got Emily to babysit.
- Finally!
- Emily's back!
And I agreed to let
Juliette see Cadence.
Please tell me I'm not
making a horrible mistake.
No, you know, no matter
how rough things get,
a girl never stops wanting
her mama, so that's good.
- To Cadence.
- Yeah.
You know, I'm not sure I'm comfortable
with you getting drunk
in honor of my daughter.
Okay, uh, how about to...
to us?
- That'll work.
- Yeah.
- Sure.
- Cheers.
Hey.
Hey.
I guess some things don't change.
I do support you, Ray.
I do... Your career, Highway
'cause I know how much it means to you.
I just got jealous, you know?
And not because you did anything wrong
or because I thought Markus
was gonna take you away from me.
It's just...
All that time in the studio,
that used to be us, baby.
That was me.
You know how it is when
two people are making music.
It's just so...
so damn intimate.
I know. I miss you, and I need you.
I'm right here, baby.
God.
Sometimes I just wish I could
do everything all over again.
What would you change?
Everything.
Nothing.
Except this.
Baby, I love you so much.
Will you marry me?
Yeah.
Yeah?
