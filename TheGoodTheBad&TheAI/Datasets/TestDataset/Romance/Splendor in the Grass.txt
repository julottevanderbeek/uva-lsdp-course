Deanie, please.
Bud, I'm afraid.
Oh, Bud.
Don't, Bud.
No.
We mustn't, Bud.
No. No.
Bud, don't be mad.
I'd better take you home.
We've had enough kissing for tonight.
Has Bud left?
Yes, Mom.
There's wonderful news tonight.
The Stamper Oil stocks, drink your milk,
went up 14 points today.
Think of it, honey.
That means if we sold those stocks,
we'd make $15,000.
Maybe we can even send you away
to college next year.
Well, we're not going to sell.
Your father says that everyone
at the Elks says...
...that the stocks are going up even higher.
Didn't Bud say anything about it tonight?
He doesn't know anything
about his father's business, Mom.
He doesn't care about that.
What were you and Bud doing all this time,
for heaven's sake?
We were studying together.
I'm going to bed, Mom. I'm awfully tired.
Now, Wilma Dean....
I want to talk to you.
Now, Wilma Dean, Bud Stamper could
get you into a whole lot of trouble.
And you know how I mean.
Boys don't respect a girl
they can go all the way with.
Boys want a nice girl for a wife.
Wilma Dean, you and Bud haven't gone
too far already, have you?
No, Mother.
Tell me the truth, Wilma Dean!
No, Mom, we haven't gone too far.
That's a relief.
Mom?
Is it so terrible to have those feelings
about a boy?
No nice girl does.
Doesn't she?
No. No nice girl.
But, Mom...
...didn't you ever....
Didn't you ever feel that way about Dad?
Your father never laid a hand on me
until we were married.
And then...
...I just gave in because a wife has to.
A woman doesn't enjoy those things
the way a man does.
She just lets her husband...
...come near her in order to have children.
Deanie, what's troubling you?
Oh, nothing, Mom.
I'm just tired.
I want to go to bed now.
Now, Deanie...
...you tell Bud Stamper to bring you home
earlier after this...
...especially on school nights.
"Good night, sleep tight,
don't let the bedbugs bite."
'Night.
"Our Father which art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name...."
Something wrong?
Wilma Dean and the Stamper boy
are in love.
They're in love, I tell you, Del!
Go back to sleep, Mama.
He'd be the catch of a lifetime, Del.
I hope we bring in a gusher
every day, Boss!
Hold it! Hold it!
Boss, Bud's here. Here's Bud!
Come on in here, my boy.
Your old man will get us in trouble
with our wives...
...'cause we'll go home smelling
like home brew and they'll wonder why.
They'll want some, too.
-Get something to eat, Son.
-I gotta go up to bed now.
Wait a minute, Son. I want to talk to you.
You go on entertaining yourselves.
I'll have a few words with my boy here.
Have more of this venison.
You don't get meat like that anymore.
They don't make home brew
like that anymore.
It's pretty late for a boy
keeping football training, isn't it?
Come here. I want to talk to you, Son.
You're the captain of the team, Son.
Those other boys look up to you.
You gotta run with the ball.
I wasn't much older than you, Bud,
when I fell off that crown block...
...and I hit that rig floor.
And my running days was long gone.
So, you're doing the running
for both of us now, boy.
Listen, I brought in a well today.
She's flowing over 100 barrels an hour,
and our stocks are going way up.
Those big Eastern companies are beginning
to take notice of us.
Them people really beginning
to take notice of us.
-That's great.
-You been out with the Loomis girl?
-Yes, sir.
-Are you watching yourself with her?
You're not doing anything
you'll be ashamed of, are you?
No, sir.
She's a nice kid, Son. She's a good looker.
I've known her folks ever since
old Del and I were boys together.
I got nothing against them
'cause they're poor.
I'm not a snob or anything like that.
The only difference between me and Del
is that I got ambition.
Hey, Dad, l--
But if anything was to happen,
you'd have to marry her.
You'd have to marry her, Son.
You realize that, don't you?
You get a girl in trouble
and you gotta take the consequences.
-Dad, I'm not--
-Sit down.
-I want to talk to you--
-Sit down.
-I want to talk to you about that.
-All right.
All right, lay it on me. Come on.
Lay it on me. That a boy.
There we go, lay it on me.
Lay it on now. Lick like a bear.
We got a future, boy.
You and me, we got a future.
First, we'll get you an education.
The best. Four years at Yale.
Did I tell you a secret?
-I'll tell you a secret.
-What?
Come here.
My company is gonna merge
with one of those big Eastern companies.
I'm gonna put you in there, boy.
I'm lining up a future for you, boy.
I've been thinking about--
There ain't nothing in this world
that I wouldn't do for you, boy.
I know.
There's nothing I wouldn't do
if you do right.
If you do right, Bud!
Now, don't disappoint me, Son.
Don't disappoint me, boy.
God knows I've had
one disappointment already.
-She asleep?
-Yes, finally.
-Is Sis back?
-Hello, Bud, darling.
Mother brought her home
from Chicago a little while ago.
Welcome home, Mom.
It was a miserable trip, just miserable.
How's Deanie?
I don't know.
I'm gonna go to bed, Dad.
I'm going to bed, too,
but I'm afraid I won't sleep a wink.
Yeah, you go to bed, Son.
You got a football game to win tomorrow.
I got all my hopes pinned on you now.
How're you men getting on in there?
Well, you certainly spoiled that girl.
First you send her off to finishing school.
She breaks all the rules
and they kick her out.
Then you send her off to university.
She goes hog wild
and flunks all her courses.
Then you had to learn your lesson
all over again, didn't you?
Let her go off to art school
in a wild place like Chicago.
She gets tied up with some cake-eater who
gets her into trouble so he can marry her.
Your lawyer got it annulled.
Damn right I got it annulled.
When I made it clear to "Mr. Cake-Eater"
that I'd cut off her allowance...
...he backed out in a hurry.
She's just a headstrong little flapper...
...but I'll keep her home
and teach her a little discipline.
Yes, sir.
I'm gonna keep that young lady home,
teach her a little discipline.
If you think I'll stay
in this God-forsaken town...
...and have people gossip about me,
you've got another think coming.
I'll really give them something
to gossip about.
Why, Sister, you're up so early!
I can't sleep in this house.
I'm going to California and live
with Aunt Blossom and study art.
Art who?
Welcome home, Miss Virginia.
Phoebe.
I hate it here. I'm a freak in this town.
Everybody stares at me
like I'm something out of a carnival.
'Cause you peroxide your hair
and paint your face like an Indian.
Good morning, everybody.
-Hey, how are you?
-Just great.
He's gonna make me stay home
a whole year just to punish me.
There aren't any more schools left
that'll have you.
There's nothing so distasteful--
This is the ugliest place
in the whole world.
Everywhere you look is an oil well,
even on the front lawn.
I'll bet you'd drill right here
in the dining room.
Damn right I would, if I thought
there was any oil in there.
I'll see you later.
How do you want your eggs, Bud darling?
Come back here
and eat a decent breakfast!
I'm late.
Come back! You can't play a football game
on a breakfast like that!
Neither of my children gets
any real nourishment.
Hey, you want a peach?
What?
Don't! Bud, don't!
Pardonnez-moi.
Wilma Dean, hereafter,
I shall count you tardy...
...if you are not in your seat
when the bell rings.
I'm sorry, Miss Metcalf.
Alan, please.
All right.
For the first few weeks,
we've been reading...
...the stories of King Arthur
and the Knights of the Round Table.
The literature of the age
was characterized by....
All right, Alan?
"By high ideals."
True. And by what else?
You going with us to the football game?
All right, Carolyn?
They were very religious.
Religion was an important part of the lives
of the Knights and their fair ladies.
What else?
I'm going with you, but I'm waiting
for Bud after the game.
We knew that, crazy.
The Knights of the Round Table....
-Just because his father's got money--
-That's not true.
Well, they were very brave
and things like that.
Bud Stamper isn't stuck on himself at all.
What in the world do you mean
by "things like that" exactly?
Well, I don't know exactly.
Let us learn to express ourselves
with as much precision as possible.
Juanita, you had your hand up?
The Knights of the Round Table
had a very high regard for women.
In what way, Juanita?
They looked on women as very pure.
They wouldn't look on her as very pure.
All right now, I want it quiet
in this classroom!
The next time there is talking
while this class is in session...
...I am going to send the culprit
to the principal's office.
Yes, Juanita, you're quite right.
The Knights did have a very high regard
for womanhood.
In fact, they put women on a pedestal.
Some people say that chivalry is not dead.
Well, how about it, girls?
Do any of you feel
that you're on a pedestal?
That's unnecessary roughness.
Fifteen yards.
Come on, you've been on me all day!
You're out! You're out of the game!
Who you taking out, Toots?
Never mind who.
Okay, okay, what's so funny about that?
She's the only girl who knows
what it's all about.
You can say that again.
I'll never look twice at those other girls.
They expect you to be satisfied
if they even kiss you good night.
Hi, Bud.
Hi, Juanita.
Did you see Toots in there?
Yeah, yeah. He should be right out.
You played a wonderful game.
Thank you.
He should be right out.
Hi, sweetheart.
I suppose you wish I were more
like Juanita Howard, don't you?
What?
I saw the way you were looking at her.
I think she's disgraceful.
The way she stands
waiting for one of the players--
Wait a minute.
There isn't any reason in the world
why I shouldn't speak to her.
You were more than speaking to her.
I'm supposed to not notice her?
Is that what you expect out of me?
I'm not even supposed to know
girls like that exist, huh?
Bud, I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry, Bud, honest.
-All right, you're sorry.
Mr. Loomis, a customer for meat.
Bud, please don't be mad.
I'm not mad, Deanie.
Hi, Bud. Deanie.
-Hi, Mr. Loomis.
-Hi, Dad.
I just can't stand it
when you're mad at me.
I don't know what's the matter
with me lately.
I'm always losing my temper.
You're the only girl in the world for me,
you know that?
I want to be.
If it weren't for you....
If it weren't for you, Deanie, I'd....
I don't know!
Bud, it's broad daylight.
-Who cares?
-Stop it. Stop it.
Come on now. Bud! People can see us.
I don't care.
Bud, stop it. Come on now.
Mom?
Mom?
She's not here.
-Mom?
-"Mom? "
Nobody's here.
Stop that.
Yes, Mrs. Harper, here's your change.
Stop it. I have to pull down
the shade to the store.
Bud, stop it.
You're nuts about me, aren't you?
You're nuts about me.
I've got your ten-pound sack
in the back of the store, Mrs. Thatcher.
At my feet, slave!
-Bud, don't.
-Tell me you love me.
-You're hurting me.
-Say you can't live without me.
-Say it!
-I do.
-Do what?
-I do love you.
And you can't live without me.
You'd be everything I ever ask you to be.
I'd do anything for you.
Deanie, I didn't mean to hurt you.
Deanie, I was just kidding.
I'm the one; I should go down
on my knees to you.
I was just kidding.
I thought you knew that.
I can't kid about these things...
...because I am nuts about you.
And I would go down on my knees
to worship you if you really wanted me to.
Bud, I can't get along without you.
And I would do anything you'd ask me to.
I would.
I would.
Anything.
-Let's speak of it at the next meeting.
-I certainly will, if you will.
I'm going in to fix supper now.
-Bye-bye, Nell.
-'Bye, Frieda.
Hi, Mom.
The coast is clear.
Are we going to the victory dance?
I can think of things I'd rather do.
I'll be ready.
I'll pick you up right after dinner then.
Did he tell you about his sister Ginny?
No.
Ginny Stamper is too low
for the dogs to bite.
Come here.
She met some man in Chicago,
put her in the family way.
Mrs. Stamper had to go out there
and get her, take her to a doctor.
Store's all locked up.
Good.
To have one of those
awful operations performed.
Mom, that's gossip.
Every word is true.
I was at the DAR and heard all about it.
Mrs. Whitcomb lives across the street
from the Stampers...
...and she knows everything
that goes on in their house.
That's what happens to girls
who go wild and boy-crazy.
Well, congratulations, Son!
The game, boy, the game.
Thank you.
I'll run along upstairs and....
Dad, I have to talk to you.
I've just about had all the nonsense
I intend to take out of you.
Get out of here, young lady.
I'm gonna have a talk with my boy.
All right, Son.
All right, go ahead.
Dad, I'm gonna marry Deanie.
Whoa now, Son.
You see, I don't really wanna go to Yale.
I'm not a very good student.
What do you mean
you're not a good student?
Boy, you can do anything
you set your mind to do.
I'd like to go to a good agricultural college
for a couple of years.
I'd really like to do that.
I could come right back here...
...and take over your ranch
just south of town.
Ranching's no life.
I could marry Deanie,
take her to college with me.
That's what I really want.
She'd be a big help to me, Dad.
I spent my life trying to create a place
of importance for you in this world...
...then you come home telling me
you want to marry some little girl!
It's what I want that counts.
Son, a boy your age doesn't even know
what he wants.
After you've had a college education,
you might change your mind.
A college education
will take me four years.
-Trust me.
-I do trust you, but--
-Trust me this time, Son.
-I trust you, Dad.
I do trust you, but four years--
Listen to me now.
But, Dad....
Son, all I'm asking you to do is
to finish Yale.
Then if you still want to marry her,
return and marry her with my blessing.
I'll send you both off to Europe
for a honeymoon.
Bud, please wait, Son.
I just don't know if I can, Dad.
I feel like I'm going nuts sometimes.
I understand, Son.
Your old man understands, Son.
What you need for the time being is...
...a different kind of girl.
When I was a boy, Son,
there was always two kinds of girls.
Us boys, we'd never even mention them
in the same breath...
...but every now and then one of us boys
would sneak off with a girl...
...and we'd get a little steam
out of our system.
No girl looks good to me except Deanie.
I know, Son.
I know.
I love her, Dad.
I know, Son, I know.
See, I don't want to do that.
Okay, I'll go to Yale.
But I want to tell you now,
I'll marry her as soon as I get out.
That's a promise.
-I want you to remember that.
-It's a promise.
It's a promise, Son. I'll send you both
off to Europe on a honeymoon.
-That's a promise.
-Okay.
Bud, I'll wait for you.
I'll wait for you forever.
I'll do anything you want, Bud.
Yes, it's a time of great prosperity
for us all, and we must give thanks.
But let us not forget Christ's warning
to the multitude.
"Lay not up treasures for yourselves
on earth...
"...where moth and rust doth corrupt...
"...and where thieves break through
and steal:
"But lay up for yourselves treasures
in heaven...
"...where neither moth nor rust
doth corrupt...
"...and where thieves do not
break through and steal:
"For where your treasure is,
there will your heart be also."
Fine sermon. Fine sermon.
Let us pray.
Take my advice, Del.
Hang onto those stocks of yours.
This comedian said,
"You ain't seen nothing yet."
We're hanging on.
Fine sermon, Reverend, fine sermon.
Wonderful passage.
Don't light a cigarette
in front of all these church people!
Do you want me to be a hypocrite?
Who would've thought that one day
our kids would be, well, engaged sort of?
I'm mighty proud
of my son's choice, Frieda.
I'm mighty proud of your boy, too.
Excuse us, honey.
I'll see you at dinner tonight. Don't forget.
Dad, I'm no spy.
All I'm asking you to do is keep an eye
on her while I'm in New York.
She likes you, Son. She won't do
anything crazy when you're around.
Virginia, I told you, your father has
the key to that cabinet...
...and he's on the train to New York.
That's him all over. He keeps it locked.
He doesn't think
anybody should drink but him.
You may be shocking Glenn.
Virginia, after all,
we do have prohibition, you know.
Maybe Glenn doesn't approve of drinking.
Quick, Henry, the flit.
Has your family lived long in town?
They just moved here from Oklahoma.
Oh, I see.
Is your father engaged
in some business in town?
His father is looking for work
and Glenn works at the filling station...
...on the corner of Sycamore and Main.
Anything else you'd like to know?
Ginny, I see no reason at all
for your bad nature.
Bud, you're not eating a thing.
I'm bored!
Come on, let's go.
There's a lovely dessert coming.
I don't want a lovely dessert.
Glenn and I are going for a ride.
Come on.
Deanie and I'll go with you and Glenn.
Wake up.
Hey, Buddy boy, you're a Boy Scout.
Run in and build us a nice, hot fire.
My hair's a mess.
Where?
Here.
Stop it. Stop it.
"Everybody's wild about Mabel
"She's the talk of the town
"Mabel's willing and able
"To show a guy around
"She's a tease, she's a flirt
"You better watch out or you'll get hurt"
Good, Buddy boy.
Now, how about a drink?
I forgot, Buddy boy's in training.
What about you, Deanie girl?
You want a drink?
Come on, Deanie.
Come on, have a little drink. Come on.
Or is Deanie girl in training, too?
Lay off, Ginny.
Why don't you relax?
You're just standing around
like a chaperone.
Is that what you came out here for,
just to chaperone Glenn and me?
Ain't he pretty, Deanie, huh?
My handsome filling-station attendant.
Fill me up, please, I'm empty.
Come on, honey, let's go for a walk.
All right.
Yeah, why don't you go
for a walk upstairs?
Why don't you quit trying to pretend
you're so pure and righteous?
If you weren't my sister--
If I weren't your sister,
you wouldn't do anything.
You never do anything
except what Dad tells you.
Isn't that right, Deanie?
You been finding that out, haven't you?
He just lets things torment him inside
and make him miserable...
...and he never does anything about them.
He never does anything.
'Bye.
All this is gonna be ours someday.
This is the most wonderful Christmas
I've ever had.
Isn't it beautiful? Oh, Dad,
it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
I wonder what Bud paid for it?
Why do you always think about the cost?
If you want to know,
I wish it was a lot less and was a ring.
-Don't, Mom, don't.
-Four years, you'll be....
All right, all right.
I just wish that Bud Stamper
had a little more gumption.
Always drink plenty of milk, Deanie.
Still.
Still.
One, two. There.
Thank you.
One more, please.
I don't know why I couldn't have had a car.
Why should I buy you a car?
You got your mother's coupe.
That coupe is a wreck.
-What have you done with your hair?
-I just put a henna rinse in it.
Still.
Still.
I'll get it.
One. Two. There.
Thank God that's over.
-Hi, Ginny.
-Oh, Brian.
My parents are in there.
-Perfume?
-Arpege.
It's my favorite.
I just have to slip on my dress.
Come meet the folks. Come on.
They're kind of dull,
but you can stand them for a few minutes.
Go on!
-Hello. I'm Ace Stamper.
-I'm Brian Stacey.
-What can I do for you?
-I'm waiting for Ginny.
She may take forever. Come on in.
This is my son, Bud.
Come here, Son.
The boy's captain of the football team.
You heard about him?
I don't get to many games.
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.
This is my wife, Mrs. Stamper.
Won't you come in?
Ginny, I want to talk to you.
Come on in.
Ginny, I know who that guy is.
That guy's a bootlegger.
Is he? Here, do me up.
He's married. Do you know that?
How do you know so much about him,
sweetie-pie?
-You're not going out with him.
-Is that so?
-Try to stop me.
-This is Christmas Day.
You'll stay home and you'll be decent
to your mother.
-You're not leaving!
-Get out of my way!
If you want to listen to Dad, go ahead.
One of these days you'll find out.
You'll find out and then God help you.
All right, calm down, everybody.
Come on now, just calm down!
All right, boys, give me a fanfare.
Give me a fanfare.
You people, shut up in there!
Let's crowd around here,
crowd around here.
We'll bring this New Year in right.
For Joe!
Happy New Year!
You look lovely, boy!
You're the prettiest baby here!
Shake that jelly.
Look, Daddy. Happy New Year!
Shake that jelly. Shake it! Shake it!
Daddy, look at us.
Daddy, look!
Come on, move aside.
Hey, let me through there.
Hey, Smokey boy,
let me ring your doorbell.
Happy New Year, Daddy.
You cut that out!
You behave yourself.
You behave yourself, you hear me?
Mr. Stamper, the perfume is coming in.
Yeah, perfume for all the ladies.
Line up, ladies.
Line up to get your perfume.
Come on, get your perfume,
all you ladies.
Happy New Year, Son.
Go on, get in line. There's some for you.
It will be a great year for both of us.
-Dance with me, Dick?
-No thanks, Ginny.
Boy, oh boy, she's really plastered.
Hello, Bill.
She's disgraceful.
It's all she can do to walk.
Why don't her folks
do something about her?
What did she do to her hair?
Charley, will you dance with me?
Not right now, Ginny.
I didn't know you were married.
Hey, look out!
What do you think you're doing?
Happy New Year, Joe!
Go get your sister, Son,
and take her on home.
-Hey, Sis.
-Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.
-What's happy about it?
You want to dance?
Where are you taking me?
-Where are you taking me?
-Sis, let me take you home.
No!
No, I'm not going home.
-Can I do your dress up?
-No.
You're all unsnapped here.
Get away. I'm not going home.
And you don't have to dance with me.
Ginny, I like to dance
with a good-looking girl once in a while.
If you weren't my brother
you wouldn't even come near me.
You're a nice boy! You're nice!
I know what you nice boys are like.
I know, you only talk to me in the dark!
In the dark!
You talk to me then, don't you?
You talk to me in the dark, in automobiles!
You talk to me!
You're very familiar then, aren't you?
Get away from me!
Joe, where have you been?
-Where's Joe?
-Here I am.
Come on, Joe. Let's go.
Where?
Anywhere!
Let's go, honey.
Happy New Year!
Hey, come on.
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.
I'm dizzy.
No!
Did you see where Arnold went?
-You get stood up, Kay?
-It looks like it.
Bud, would you be an angel, huh?
-I'll love you for the rest of my life.
-I'll go look for him.
Cut it out, it's his sister!
Now lay off, Bill!
Cut it out, I tell you, she's his sister.
He's gone mad.
Stop this fight! Stop this fight!
It wasn't his fault. No one's to blame.
Let's go.
Come on inside a minute. Okay?
-Do you wanna come inside?
-No.
We gotta stop all this kissing
and fooling around, Deanie.
Tell me what's happened.
I just don't think we'd better
see each other for a while.
I have to go. Goodbye.
We planned the whole play around you.
You're supposed to be there.
What's the matter?
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry, my foot!
-You keep training?
-Yes, sir.
-Hours? Diet?
-Yes, sir.
All right, let's try it again.
I said, let's try it again.
I want very much to say this:
I want to give most of you
a high compliment on your term paper.
They're the best set of papers
I've ever received.
Bud?
Just a minute.
There's something I've got to tell you.
Your term paper was not very good.
Well, I guess so.
Remember, you've got to do much better...
...if you're going to get into Yale in the fall.
Hi.
I miss you, Bud.
I just wanted to wish you good luck
on the game.
Thanks.
Dr. Smiley.
-Doc?
-Yes, Bud.
-What happened?
-You tell me.
What do you want? What is it?
What's wrong with him?
He just had a fall.
There's nothing to worry about at all.
There's a lot of pneumonia around.
-Pneumonia?
-My God!
Yes, I know.
I've signed my name to this check.
Pull my boy through
and I'm willing to give you a bonus.
You just fill out the amount,
$5,000, $10,000--
I'm doing everything that can be done.
You just fill out the amount.
I think the boy's going to be all right,
but if he isn't....
What do you mean, "if he isn't"?
Ace, I'm not a very religious man,
but I know what every doctor knows.
You can't reckon with the will of God.
Just say whatever is in your heart,
Wilma Dean.
All I can think of is, "Dear God,
make him well, make him well."
Then that's your prayer.
But aren't there some words I should say
out of the Bible?
I can't think of any that would be better
than your own.
Oh, please, God, make him well.
Make him well.
Well, Bud, in another week or so
you'll be feeling yourself again.
Then spring will be here.
You know what happens
to a young man's fancy in the springtime.
-You go with Del Loomis' girl, don't you?
-Yeah.
Mighty attractive girl.
She sure is.
-I'm pretty nuts about Deanie Loomis.
-I don't blame you.
I mean, I love her.
And she loves me.
But it's no fun to be in love. It hurts.
Every time that we're together...
...I have to...
...remember things.
You know what I mean?
Oh, yes.
I just can't go back to seeing her again.
Not like the way we were doing.
We'd go out every night and...
...I'd hold her and I'd kiss her and...
...I'd just go home.
I mean, a guy can go nuts that way.
I don't know how to advise you, Bud.
My dad said...
...that I should get another kind of a girl.
No.
But when you don't really want
another girl....
No.
I don't know.
Come in again Friday, Bud.
I'll give you another shot of iron...
...and another sun-lamp treatment.
Okay, Doc.
So long.
Hi, Deanie.
And that was the surest way to lose him.
What did you say?
-He's an animal.
-He is not.
-Yes, he is. I met him.
-You don't know him.
Who's an animal?
-You're out.
-I am not.
Yes, you are.
-I hurt my finger.
-I'll kiss it and make it better.
"What though the radiance
which was once so bright
"Is now for ever taken from my sight...
"Though nothing can bring back the hour
Of splendor in the grass...
"...of glory in the flower;
"We will grieve not, rather find
"Strength in what remains behind...."
What do you suppose the poet means
by these lines?
Deanie Loomis?
I'm sorry, Miss Metcalf.
I didn't hear the question.
I know it's spring but I must ask you
to pay more attention.
I'm sorry.
I quoted some lines from Wordsworth's
Ode on Intimations of Immortality.
Did you hear them?
I'm afraid not, Miss Metcalf.
Then I must ask you to turn your text
to Page 380.
Yes, l....
You read the lines to me.
Yes.
Stand please.
"Though nothing can bring back the hour
"Of splendor in the grass...
"...of glory in the flower;
"We will grieve not, rather find
"Strength in what remains behind...."
Perhaps you can tell me
exactly what the poet means...
...by such expressions as
"splendor in the grass"...
...and "glory in the flower."
I think it has some....
Yes?
Well, when we're young...
...we look at things very idealistically,
I guess.
And I think Wordsworth means...
...that when we grow up...
...that we have to forget
the ideals of youth...
...and find strength....
Miss Metcalf...
...may I please be....
Children!
I'll go see what's the matter.
-Hi, June.
-Hi.
I just gave her a sedative.
-I'm not sick.
-She'll be all right in a little while.
Now lie down.
I'm all right. I'm perfectly all right.
Stop that.
I'm all right.
I don't care if his father is making
my folks rich. I hate Bud Stamper.
-You'd take a date if he asked you.
-I would not.
-You know you would.
-I absolutely would not.
Here he comes.
Hi.
All right.
Why aren't you going out
for track this year?
Got all that work to make up
from when I was sick.
You going to Yale? You going to Yale?
Yeah, if my grades are good enough.
How come you're not dating Deanie
anymore?
I'm just not.
I guess I'll just go to cow college.
I'm only a farmer and I know it.
Hot dog! Now it's my chance.
Any objections?
I can't stop you.
