They probably seen a
lot of those shows.
Mentalists

you will be shocked to know
that sometimes
not often, but sometimes
its the real deal.
masquerding as an act
hidden behind
a few 50 dollar tricks
hiding in plain sight
Because if the magicians
doesnt do that,
the alternative is impossible
for others to live with
anyway Wednesday nights
the back page doesnt pay very well,
so I gamble.
But I don't play against other people,
only against the house.
so,no mega
Jack Pots,no wash outs
The idea is to go unnoticed.
that way I can keep coming back
I'm not a God.
I can't see everyone's future
only my own.
and only within
except for when I saw her
but we will come back to that
there is no pattern to this guy.
he is all over the map.
well he's not counting not enough.
Wait a minute.

Las Vegas. Whats his name?
Cadillac.
Yes, Frank Cadillac.

He cant trick the deck
I'm telling you. that little prick
knows whats coming
If he's really knocking a system
why's he not betting more
That will be my second question
look at him.
he is looking at us
Its like he can hear us.
- What table is that?
- 27.
Send security

every time you look at it,
It changes.
Because you look at it,
and that changes everything else.
Empty the drawer.

Where the hell is he?
Black shirt,straw hat

the casino two months ago
what he does has nothing to do with luck
its an ability. look at him!
he knows exactly what to do.
Can it explain to me that?
I cannot explain, Kelly.
nor do I have the time.
The Russian Federation has a 10 kiloton
nuclear munition unaccounted for
I understand that
I'm not sure you do.
We need every
agent available beating the street.
that bomb was stolen
We have just been informed of it now.

He stole a car from valet parking
Yes, yes I know Cadillac.
I thought he was cheating us at cards.

The man he tackled was one
of the two casino killers in reno.

Yes, of course yes.

we were saying that if he had
a system why wasnt he bidding more

anything else?
mumbles...
and right then.

he looked up. really
so he doesnt have to be there to do it
is that to work the system.
Thank you.
Were finished.

thats going to be difficult. considering
theres a hundred cameras at the casino

but thats not a life.
but you kind of forget that girl.
that you Keep seeing in your head.

Do you happen to see if its Canada?
Because...
Because its could be 10 years
Its gotta be soon.
I never see further ahead than two minutes
Except for her
And what do you think
the reason is for that?
I don't know.
Maybe she doesn't scare easy.
Maybe she is the one

on a practical note. we are
standing in front of a stolen vehicle.
and you are wanted for assault
involving a weapon at a casino
that was an accident. he had a gun
and he was going to shoot two people
yes?

The deed goes unpunished does it?
I can fix your legal problems..
but you gotta step up
Or else your next
magic show...
will be in the state prison.
its ironic but...
people like you who try to help
end up torturing me
in the full sense of the word
since I was 3 years old.
what do they call it...
observed play therapy.
A marathon 36 hours...
can you guess the next flash card game?
so, please...
leave me alone.
Let me live some semblence of a normal life.
I would love to indulge
your feelings. But Im dealing...
with a slightly larger picture right now
now you can exercise your responsibility
to help your fellow men...

responsibility for you.

both heading in the same direction.
I don't know if I can call
that amazing, but...
thats destiny.
Thats what it really is
your starting to get the psycho on.
Ah, no... you don't believe in destiny?
even if it does exist,
I just don't want to know
I mean if every move you make
is pre-ordained.
What is the point
life is supposed to a surprise
It would be nice.
hes came in twice a day for
a week at exactly 9 past 8?
Yes, he would stay a few minutes,
have a martini and then he'd go.
not today when he was with that lady.
Did you find anything strange about that?
not strange enough to call the police.
we got a regular who counts
the cornflakes in his bowel.
because it has to be an even number.
do you have any cameras?
Inside? No.
outside?
No.
do you know the kind of car
he was driving?
or maybe overhear
where they were going?
I don't know what car but they were leaving
for cascade.
thats what they said
Another regular. she's always on a diet.
brings in a scale with the salad dressing
Thank you.
You're welcome.
this guy knows we are after him.
he saw us coming here.
he doesnt know if its day or night,
its the time he's waiting for her.
There is a traffic camera
over there. At the bank.

and catch them at the wide
Remember roybal. the casino chief?

after getting a knee cap shot off.

Somebody wants information,
next time anything happens...
relevent to Johnson,
I want to know right away.
I dont care if its a paper clip.

The head of casino security.
What did you learn from him?
for a macho guy, he screams like a girl.
he was questioned by federal agents,
looking for Chris Jonhson.
Yes?
He said they
hadn't found him yet.
Do you believe this shit?
he see's things before they happen?
it makes no difference
what I believe.
look, we spent two
years setting this up.
And that man out there is worried
all this will be comprimised by Johnson
We are wasting our time with this.
for a magician.
we are being paid to secure
the operations room.
not to hunt down some
carnival party
really?
then why are the
same authorities that
are looking for us
so interested in him?
get rid of him.
do it now.
We have a super reservation.
I teach there once a week.
The conditions are pretty lousy.
Thats in the Great Canyon.
One of the eight wonders of the world.
Hello, Sam.
Hello, Liz.
A couple hundred years ago
this place was booming
plenty of food and thriving culture.
they should be better off.
I guess this is destiny then.
I would like to meet there shaman.
I read once, in the many
North American tribes.
That the shamans purpose
wasn't only healing.
And that they also claim
their power of the atmosphere.
To bring on and stop rain
even though future advance.
Do you think thats possible?
I believe any thing is possible.
Me too.

and I couldnt miss that.
Who is that man with you?
- Is he your boyfriend?
- No, no not my boyfriend.

Because he looks at you like
my brother looks at his girlfriend.

I found this rock out
in the Canyon.
I want you to hold this

back in Vegas.
Frank Cadillac show.
I thought your name was Chris.
It is.
Frank Cadillac is my stage name.

I took two things I really like
and I put them together.
Frankenstein and Cadillac.
Your odd.
Charming.
But odd.
cease fire

Nice
It was close though?
ok.
you were right about the traffic camera
We got a positive ID
Chris?
its ok.
Did I snore?
snore?
- Yes.
- Ah, no.
As and that worsened
so much like this the climate?
Yes.
I like the rain.
I like rain too
do you know once...
I think was in Denmark,
it rained fish...
because the sun dehydrated the water.
took it out in the atmosphere.
rehydrated the fish eggs, and
it hatched and it..
and it rained fish.
That the truth?
Yes, in the clouds. true story.
happened 15 years ago.
felt like sharing that
with you.
The road's washed out ahead.
you can't cross until morning.
not even then its a sure shot
spin around and go back about two miles
take your second left
- there will be a hotel there called...
- The Cliff Hangar. Thank you.
Correct.
him right?
thats it
no front plate,
where is the other side?
I don't have it.
What was that at the front window?
go back
Back,back.
back, there!
Zoom in.
its a permit.
Track it and find it.
I will light a fire.
Chris, one little problem.
no, no, I will sleep in the car.
- Take it.
- Thank you.
sure.
you hear the joke about the zen master
who ordered a hot dog?
No.
He said that he would have
one with everything.
Good night.
Good night.
What have we got?
They went to sleep in a motel
outside cascade.
We found an Arizona foreman
who remembers the land cruiser.
How did they do that?
The road was blocked and he was about to
suggest a place to stay.
But Johnson already know, right?
Exactly.
Callie, it just got worse
all right people,
we got a nuclear alert. code red.
In the southern California region.
LA to San Diego,
nuclear emergency search teams are on
there way. but until they get here...
somebody please tell me wht my
agency, the FBI are doing about it?
sir, two main suspects
have been interrogated.
cars and transmits have been checked
perimeter was revised and...
we have opened up surveillance on 2 or 3
suspects but nothing actionable yet.
Then what the hell are we doing?
waiting for something actionable...
we got 8 million lives
that are precaurious at best
so I say we widen this net
to slightly suspicious
and get some decent Intel
before this nuke blows up Los Angeles.
alright, Callie.
What do you propose we do next?
I believe that the
urgency of the situation...
compels the use of any and all resources to
obtain Cris Johnson.
We know where he is.
let my team pick him up
The FBI are mobilizing.
Continue watching.
- Did you listen?
- Yes.
He says they are mobilising.
standard procedure
tell them to wrap it up
They will lead us straight to Johnson.
- Don't lose sight of them
- Certainly, ok.
you hungry? there is
a coffee shop down the road
I'd rather eat here,
if thats ok.
fine.
What?
there is an Italian painter
named Calion.
he...
he defined beauty...
he said it was a summation of the parts...
working together in such a way
in such a way...
that nothing needed to added
taken away or altered
like you
your beautiful.
wow!
It was incredible
What was?
This.
Its good here, the best place to
view hotel.
We should cover different places,
that road and that turn off.
A team with a parabolic step right here.
thats fine, but I also
want mobile surveillance...
for case something skirt of the
control. I want to be flexible
Ferris?
call the local police in flagstaff.
have them patrol the outside perimeter
I want that area locked down.
A body turned up at an apartment,
in line of sight of my office...
with a slit throat,
like roybal.
The body trying to follow us to
Johnson.
Chris?
Yes.
Maybe destiny exists.

Within two minutes,
he will start seeing whats going to happen
I hope so.

I only need a few minutes of your time
Yes,sure.
They are putting her in the car.
Back.

Everything that he told you...

He's a sociopath
My God.
Drugs.
Return to the hotel, have
a drink put one of these...
in his glass
It will take 5 minutes to put him to
sleep, then we will come in and get him
But this is important
you need to do it at least 2 minutes
after you get him out of the room.
that to enter in the room.
why do you need me?
why dont you just get him.
He seems to think that you work
for a pedagogic program...
for a reservation with bottoms
