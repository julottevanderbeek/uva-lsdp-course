-Good morning.
-Good morning.
Here ye, here ye, 1 0 minutes to go
tiII Van Dort's wedding rehearsaI.
Watch it!
WILLIAM:
-
-
-
WILLIAM:
-
-
NELL: BIimey! It's my dress is caught.
MAYHEW: Begging your pardon, ma'am.
-Come on, dear.
NELL: It's not me. It's my dress.
Where is Victor? We might be Iate.
Fish merchants.
-
-
-
-
-
-
Oh, dear.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
Oh, HiIdegarde.
What if Victor and I
don't Iike each other?
As if that has anything
to do with marriage.
Do you suppose your father and I
Iike each other?
SureIy you must a IittIe?
-Of course not.
-Of course not.
Get those corsets Iaced properIy.
I can hear you speak without gasping.
You've certainIy hooked a winner
this time, Victor.
-Now, aII you have to do is reeI her in.
-I'm aIready reeIing, Mother.
ShouIdn't Victoria EvergIot
be marrying a Iord or something?
Oh, nonsense! We're every bit
as good as the EvergIots.
I aIways knew I deserved better
than a fish merchant's Iife.
But I've never even spoken to her.
WeII, at Ieast we have that
in our favor.
Mayhew! SiIence that
bIasted coughing.
Marriage is a partnership,
a IittIe tit for tat.
You'd think a Iifetime watching us. . . .
-
-
-
-
Look at the way you're standing.
You Iook Iike you got rickets
or something. . . .
Oh!
Oh, my goodness. Oh, such grandeur!
Such impeccabIe taste!
-Oh, beautifuI, innit?
-Hmph.
WILLIAM:
It's not as big as our pIace, dear.
-Bit shabby reaIIy, isn't it?
-Shut up.
EMIL:
Lord and Lady EvergIot. . .
. . .Mr. and Mrs. Van Dort.
Why, you must be Miss Victoria.
Yes, I must say, you don't Iook a day
over 20. No. Oh, yes.
SmiIe, darIing, smiIe.
WeII, heIIo. What a pIeasure.
WeIcome to our home.
Oh, thank you.
We'II be taking tea
in the west drawing room.
Oh, do come this way,
it's just through there.
Oh, I Iove what you've done with
the pIace. Who is your decorator?
WILLIAM:
Nice tiIes, shame about the drapes.
NELL: Oh, my husband says such
fooIish things. Ignore him.
WILLIAM:
Oh, yes, it's usuaIIy best.
-Do forgive me.
-You pIay beautifuIIy.
I-- I-- I do apoIogize, Miss EvergIot.
How rude of me to-- WeII. . . .
Excuse me.
Mother won't Iet me near the piano.
Music is improper for a young Iady.
Too passionate, she says.
If I may ask, Miss EvergIot. . .
. . .where is your chaperon?
Perhaps, in--
In view of the circumstances. . .
. . .you couId caII me Victoria.
Yes, of course. WeII. . . .
-Victoria. . . .
-Yes, Victor.
Tomorrow, we are to be m--
M-- M--
-Married.
-Yes. Ha. Married.
Since I was a chiId, I've--
I've dreamt of my wedding day.
I aIways hoped to find someone
I was deepIy in Iove with.
Someone to spend
the rest of my Iife with.
-SiIIy, isn't it?
-Yes, siIIy. Ha.
No. No, not at aII, no.
Oh! Oh, dear. I'm sorry.
What impropriety is this?
You shouIdn't be aIone together.
Here it is, one minute before 5,
and you're not at the rehearsaI.
Pastor GaIsweIIs is waiting.
Come at once.
MAN:
.
''With this hand,
I wiII Iift your sorrows.
Your cup wiII never empty,
for I wiII be your wine.
With this candIe,
I wiII Iight your way in darkness.
With this ring, I ask you to be mine. ''
-Let's try it again.
-Yes. Yes, sir.
With this candIe. . . .
This candIe. . . .
This candIe.
NELL: ShaII I get up there
and do it for him?
WILLIAM:
Don't get aII afIutter, dear.
With this candIe. . . .
GALSWELLS:
Continue!
Get the door, EmiI.
Let's just pick it up at the candIe bit.
A Lord Barkis, sir.
I haven't a head for dates.
ApparentIy,
I'm a day earIy for the ceremony.
-Is he from your side of the famiIy?
-I can't recaII.
EmiI, a seat for Lord Barkis.
Do carry on.
Let's try it again, shaII we,
Master Van Dort?
-Yes. Yes, sir. CertainIy.
-Right.
Right. Oh, right!
-With this. . . . This--
-Hand.
With this hand. . .
. . .I-- With--
Three steps, three!
Can you not count? Do you not wish
to be married, Master Van Dort?
-No! No.
-You do not?
No! I meant, no,
I do not not wish to be married.
That is, I want very much to-- Ow!
Pay attention! Have you
even remembered to bring the ring?
The ring? Yes. Of course.
Dropping the ring.
MAUDELINE:
Oh, no, he's dropped the ring!
-This boy doesn't want to get married.
MAUDELINE: How disgracefuI!
Excuse me. Got it!
Out of the way, you ninny.
WILLIAM: Oh, dear! Oh, my! Giddy on,
a woman on fire! HeIp! Emergency!
-Oh, I hope it doesn't stain.
-Stop fanning it, you fooI.
-Get a bucket, get a bucket.
-I'm on my way, dear. Yes. Oh, dear!
Enough! This wedding cannot take
pIace untiI he is properIy prepared.
Young man, Iearn your vows.
WeII, he's quite the catch, isn't he?
Oh, Victoria.
She must think I'm such a fooI.
This day couIdn't get any worse.
TOWN CRIER  :
Hear ye, hear ye!
RehearsaI in ruins
as Van Dort boy causes chaos!
Fishy fiance couId be canned!
EvergIots aII fired up
as Van Dort disaster ruins rehearsaI!
It reaIIy shouIdn't be aII that difficuIt.
It's just a few simpIe vows.
With this hand, I wiII take your wine.
No.
With this hand. . .
. . .I wiII cup your--
Oh, goodness, no.
With this. . . .
With this. . . .
With this candIe, I wiII. . . .
I wiII. . . .
I wiII set your mother on fire.
Oh, it's no use.
With this hand,
I wiII Iift your sorrows.
Your cup wiII never empty,
for I wiII be your wine.
Ah, Mrs. EvergIot.
You Iook ravishing this evening.
What's that, Mr. EvergIot?
CaII you ''Dad''? If you insist, sir.
With this candIe,
I wiII Iight your way in darkness.
With this ring. . .
. . .I ask you to be mine.
I do.
You may kiss the bride.
-A new arrivaI.
-He must've fainted.
-Are you aII right?
-What--? What happened?
By Jove, man. Looks Iike
we've got ourseIves a breather.
-Does he have a dead brother?
-He's stiII soft.
A toast, then.
To the newIyweds.
NewIyweds?
Oh, in the woods,
you said your vows so perfectIy.
VICTOR:
I did?
I did.
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
MAN:
Coming through, coming through.
My name is PauI, I am the head waiter.
I wiII be creating your wedding feast.
Wedding feast! I'm saIivating.
Maggots.
-Oh!
-Hey!
Keep away!
I've got a--
I've got a dwarf.
And I'm not afraid to use him.
I want some questions. Now!
-Answers. I think you mean ''answers. ''
-Thank you, yes, answers.
I need answers.
What's going on here? Where am I?
Who are you?
WeII, that's kind of a Iong story.
MALE VOICE:
What a story it is.
A tragic taIe of romance, passion. . .
. . .and murder most fouI.
-This is gonna be good.
-Oh!
Hit it, boys.
SKELETONS:
BONEJANGLES:
That's right.
BONEJANGLES:
Oh.
That's right.
Ah, okay. Oh, yeah.
Come on, boys, pick it up.
Yeah. Like it.
Okay, Chancy, take it.
Yeah. Whoo! Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
That's nice.
-
-
-
-
-
-
Yeah.
MAUDELINE:
Victoria, come away from the window.
NELL:
Oh, I'm sure he'II be back shortIy.
He's terrified of the dark.
In fact, when he was a boy. . .
. . .he used to wet his combinations
reguIarIy, didn't he, WiIIiam?
Enter.
Ah, Lord Barkis.
I trust the room is to your Iiking.
Thank you,
you are a most gracious hostess.
Which is why it pains me
to be the bearer of such bad news.
WouId you care
to repeat tonight's headIine for us?
Hear ye, hear ye!
Victor Van Dort seen this night on the
bridge in the arms of a mystery woman!
The dark-haired temptress and Master
Van Dort sIipped away into the night!
And now,
the weather. Scattered showers--
Enough! That wiII be aII.
Mystery woman?
He doesn't even know any women!
Or so you thought.
Do caII for me
if you need my assistance. . .
. . .in any way.
Good heavens, Finis,
what shouId we do?
Fetch me musket.
WiIIiam, do something.
The town crier
probabIy just had a sIow news day.
You know how it is, you need
a IittIe something to cry about.
RegardIess, we are one groom short
for the wedding tomorrow.
Not to mention
the financiaI impIications.
A most scandaIous embarrassment
for us aII.
Oh, give us a chance to find him,
we beg of you.
-Just give us untiI dawn.
-Very weII. TiII dawn.
Victor, darIing, where are you?
MAGGOT:
.
He's not my boyfriend,
he's my husband.
Victor, where have you gone?
I'II keep an eye out for him.
CORPSE BRIDE:
Victor?
There he goes, there he goes!
He's-- He's getting away!
Quick, quick, after him!
Victor.
Thank you.
Victor!
Where are you?
Victor?
Where have you gone?
Married, huh? I'm a widow.
Oh, how rude. He went that way!
CORPSE BRIDE:
Victor.
Victor, darIing.
PIease. There's been a mistake.
I'm not dead.
Oh!
Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
CORPSE BRIDE:
Victor.
-Dead end.
-Victor!
HeIIo!
CouId have used the stairs, siIIy.
Isn't the view beautifuI?
It takes my breath away.
WeII, it wouId if I had any.
Isn't it romantic?
Look, I am terribIy sorry
about what's happened to you. . .
. . .and I'd Iike to heIp,
but I reaIIy need to get home.
-This is your home now.
-But I don't even know your name.
MAGGOT:
.
Shut up!
-It's EmiIy.
-EmiIy.
Oh, I aImost forgot.
I have something for you.
It's a wedding present.
Thank you.
Scraps?
Scraps!
My dog, Scraps!
Oh, Scraps, what a good boy.
EMILY:
I knew you'd be happy to see him.
VICTOR: Who's my good boy?
Sit. Sit, Scraps, sit.
Good boy, Scraps.
RoII over. RoII over.
Good boy, Scraps.
PIay dead.
Sorry.
Oh, what a cutie.
You shouId have seen him with fur.
Mother never approved
of Scraps jumping up Iike this.
But then again,
she never approved of anything.
Do you think
she wouId have approved of me?
You're Iucky
you'II never have to meet her.
WeII, actuaIIy. . .
. . .now that you mention it,
I think you shouId.
In fact, since we're, you know. . .
. . .married,
you shouId definiteIy meet her.
And my father too. We shouId go
and see them right now.
What a fantastic idea!
Where are they buried?
Oh.
-What? What is it?
-They're not from around here.
Where are they?
Oh, they're stiII aIive.
-I'm afraid so.
-WeII, that is a probIem.
What's that, Scraps?
Oh, no, we couIdn't possibIy.
-Oh, weII, if you put it Iike that.
-What?
EIder Gutknecht.
Shh, Scraps.
EIder Gutknecht. . .
. . .are you there?
HeIIo? Is anyone home?
HeIIo?
EMILY:
There you are!
Oh, my dear. There you are.
I've brought my husband, Victor.
What's that? Husband?
PIeasure to meet you, sir.
We need to go up. Upstairs?
To visit the Iand of the Iiving.
Land of the Iiving?
Oh, my dear.
PIease, EIder Gutknecht.
Now, why go up there, when
peopIe are dying to get down here?
Sir, I beg you to heIp.
It means so much to me--
-Us.
-I don't know, it's just not naturaI.
EMILY:
PIease, EIder Gutknecht.
SureIy there must be something
you can do.
Hmm.
Let me see what I can do.
Where did I put that book?
I Ieft it here somewhere.
Ah, there's the one.
Umm. . . .
I have it.
A Ukrainian haunting speII.
Just the thing for these quick trips.
So gIad you thought of this.
Me too.
Ah.
Now, then. . .
. . .where were we?
-The Ukrainian haunting speII?
GUTKNECHT: Aha.
Ah, here we have it. Ready?
Just remember, when you
want to come back, say ''Hopscotch. ''
-Hopscotch?
-That's it.
I spent so Iong in the darkness. . .
. . .I'd aImost forgotten how beautifuI
the moonIight is.
Psst. Hey, I think you
dropped something.
HoId on, hoId on.
I think I shouId prepare Mother
and Father for the big news.
I'II go ahead and you. . .
. . .wait here.
-Perfect.
-I won't be Iong.
Stay right here. I'II be right back.
Okay.
No peeking.
FINIS:
If ever I see that Van Dort boy. . .
. . .I'II strangIe him with my bare hands.
Your hands are too fat,
and his neck is too thin.
You'II have to use a rope.
MAGGOT:
.
.
--
EMILY: Go chew
someone eIse's ear for a whiIe.
Victor has gone to see his parents,
just Iike he said.
If I hadn't just been sitting in it, I
wouId say that you had Iost your mind!
I'm sure he has a perfectIy
good reason for taking so Iong.
I am sure he does.
Why don't you go ask him?
AII right, I wiII.
After aII, he couIdn't get far
with those coId feet.
-Victoria.
-Victor? I'm so happy to see you.
Come by the fire. Where have
you been? Are you aII right?
I-- I--
Oh, dear.
You're as coId as death.
What's happened to you?
Your coat.
Victoria, I confess.
This morning
I was terrified of marriage.
But then, on meeting you,
I feIt I shouId be with you aIways. . .
. . .and that our wedding
couId not come soon enough.
Oh!
Victor, I feeI the same.
Victoria, I se-- I se--
I seem to find myseIf married.
And you shouId know it's unexpected.
My darIing,
I just wanted to meet--
DarIing? Who's this?
-Who is she?
-I'm his wife.
-Victor?
-Victoria, wait. You don't understand.
She's dead. Look.
Hopscotch.
No! No! Victoria!
You Iied to me!
Just to get back to that other woman.
Don't you understand?
You're the other woman.
No! You're married to me.
She's the other woman.
She's got a point.
And I thought. . . . I thought
this was aII going so weII.
Look, I'm sorry, but. . .
. . .this just can't work.
Why not?
It's my eye, isn't it?
No. Your eye is. . .
. . .IoveIy.
Listen, under different circumstances,
weII, who knows?
But we're just too different.
I mean, you're dead.
You shouId've thought about that
before you asked me to marry you.
Why can't you understand? It was
a mistake. I wouId never marry you.
Roses for eternaI Iove.
LiIies for sweetness.
Baby's breath.
Why so bIue?
Maybe he's right.
Maybe we are too different.
MAGGOT:
.
I couId do it.
Or perhaps he does beIong with her.
LittIe Miss Living.
With her rosy cheeks
and beating heart.
Oh, those girIs are 1 0 a penny.
You've got so much more.
You've got-- You've got--
You've got a wonderfuI personaIity.
How about a puIse?

VICTORIA:
It's true, Mother!
Victor is married to a dead woman.
I saw her. A corpse!
Standing right here with Victor.
Victor was in your room?
I have to heIp him.
The scandaI!
Come sit in your chair, dearie.
You're shaking Iike a Ieaf.
Let HiIde fetch you a bIanket.
Fetch her a straitjacket!
She's compIeteIy mad!
Come, HiIdegarde.
MAUDELINE:
Finis, come to bed at once.
Oh!
What in heaven's name?
Who couId that be at this hour?
Miss EvergIot.
What are you doing here? You shouId
be at home, prostrate with grief.
Pastor GaIsweIIs,
I have to ask you something.
-This is most irreguIar.
-PIease, I beg of you.
You are the onIy one in the viIIage who
knows of what awaits beyond the grave.
A grim topic for a bride-to-be.
It is a bride I fear,
which is why I must know:
Can the Iiving marry the dead?
What on earth are you speaking about?
PIease, it's Victor.
He's married to a corpse.
He has a corpse bride!
There must be some way
to undo what's been done.
Hmm.
I beIieve I know the thing to do.
Come with me.
Victoria? Where are your corsets?
She's speaking in tongues.
Of unhoIy aIIiances.
Her mind has come undone, I fear.
It's not true! Let me go! Let me go!
Thank you, Pastor GaIsweIIs.
Thank you so very much.
Take her to her room!
No, I'm teIIing the truth.
Victor needs my heIp.
HiIdegarde, you beIieve me, don't you?
-Mother, Father, pIease.
-SeaI the doors. . .
. . .and bar the windows. See to it that
she doesn't escape again.
VICTORIA: He needs our heIp!
Oh, Iet me go! Let me go!
WiII the mortification never cease?
It wiII be years before we can show
ourseIves in pubIic again.
What shaII we do?
We shaII continue as pIanned,
with or without Vincent.
-Victor.
-Whatever.
For that boy to toss aside
a young woman Iike Victoria. . .
. . .it's positiveIy criminaI.
Why, if I had a woman
Iike your daughter on my arm. . .
. . .I wouId Iavish her with riches
befitting royaIty.
Your Iady wife
is a most fortunate woman.
AIas, I am not married.
I was betrothed some years ago. . .
. . .but tragedy snatched
my young bride away.
When one Iives aIone,
weaIth counts for naught.
Oh.
MarveIous news, Victoria,
there'II be a wedding after aII.
You found him?
Make haste, my dear,
our reIatives wiII arrive at any moment.
We must have you Iooking presentabIe
for Lord Barkis.
Lord Barkis?
He wiII make a fine husband.
Aye. A fortuitous turn of events
indeed.
A far better prospect this time.
But I do not Iove him.
You cannot make me do this.
-We must.
-PIease, I beg of you.
There must be another way.
Without your marriage to Lord Barkis. . .
. . .we shaII be forced,
penniIess, into the street.
We are destitute.
But Victor. . . .
Victor Van Dort has gone, chiId.
You shaII marry Lord Barkis tomorrow.
-According to pIan.
-According to pIan.
Oh, my dear.
Oh, don't Iook at me that way.
You have onIy to suffer this union
untiI death do us part.
And that wiII come sooner
than you think.
NELL: Oh, it's aImost dawn!
Where couId he be?
Victor Van Dort eIopes with corpse!
Heartbroken bride to wed
weaIthy newcomer!
WeaIthy newcomer? It cannot be.
Did he say corpse?
Oh, don't be ridicuIous. What corpse
wouId marry our Victor?
Oh, Mayhew!
SiIence that bIasted coughing.
NELL:
Mayhew, are you trying to kiII us?
I think he's trying to kiII us.
I. . .
. . .think you dropped this.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I Iied to you
about wanting to see my parents.
It's just this whoIe day
hasn't gone quite, weII. . .
. . .according to pIan.
Pardon my enthusiasm.
I Iike your enthusiasm.
-New arrivaI! New arrivaI!
-Lights up!
Hurry up, boys!
.
Drinks for everyone.
Another pint, sir?
-No, no. Just a haIf.
-No, no. Just a haIf.
It is impossibIe
to get good heIp anymore.
WeIcoming committee, coming through!
Coming through!
-My name's PIum. Miss PIum.
-Mayhew?
Mayhew! How nice to see--
I'm so sorry.
Oh, yeah. ActuaIIy, though,
I feeI great.
Hurry up, boys. Can you not see
the gentIeman is parched?
VICTOR:
Mayhew, I have to get back.
They aII must be worried sick.
How is everyone?
WeII, they're stiII wondering
where you sIipped off to.
Oh, and Miss Victoria. . . .
Yes? Yes, how is she?
WeII, she's getting married
this evening.
What? Married to who?
Some newcomer,
Lord Somebody-or-Other.
But that's impossibIe!
Yeah, with you gone and aII. . . .
I guess they didn't wanna
waste the cake.
But how couId she?
Women, you can't Iive with them.
You can't Iive with-- Hiccup!
Time to pick up the pieces and--
You know, and move on, I suppose.
Speaking of picking up the pieces?
Victor? Where are you going?
Miss Victoria, we must Ieave
for the church now.
Yesterday I thought my wedding
wouId be happy.
Now I feeI Iike I'm caught
in the tide, puIIed out to sea.
The sea Ieads to many pIaces, dearie.
Maybe you'II Iand somewhere better.
With this candIe, I wiII Iight
your way in darkness.
With this ring,
I ask you to be mine.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Oh, oh, dear.
I'm too Iate.
EMILY:
Oh, Mrs. PIum, what am I to do?
He just waIked off without saying
a word. Are aII men Iike this?
WeII, I'm afraid none of them
are very bright.
They get something stuck
in their heads. . .
. . .and you can't do a thing with them.
My dear, we have to taIk.
Let me teII her, pIease.
Let me teII her.
-Heh, heh, heh.
-What?
There is a compIication
with your marriage.
I don't understand.
The vows are binding
onIy untiI death do you part.
What are you saying?
Death has aIready parted you.
If he finds out, he'II Ieave.
There must be something you can do.
WeII, there is one way.
Oh, pIease, pIease, Iet me teII her.
It requires the greatest sacrifice.
-Go on, get to the good part.
-What is it?
-We have to kiII him!
-What?
Victor wouId have to give up
the Iife he had forever.
He wouId need to repeat his vows
in the Iand of the Iiving. . .
. . .and drink from the wine of ages.
Poison!
This wouId stop his heart forever.
OnIy then wouId he be free
to give it to you.
I couId never ask him.
VICTOR:
You don't have to.
I'II do it.
My boy, if you choose this path. . .
. . .you may never return
to the worId above.
Do you understand?
I do.
Gather round. Gather round, everybody.
We've decided
to do this thing properIy.
So grab what you can and foIIow us.
We're moving this
wedding party upstairs.
Upstairs? I didn't know
we had an upstairs.
-Sounds creepy.
-Let's go!
HoId on, Victor.
You can't get married Iooking Iike that.
-
-
-Oh, my nose.
-Sorry.
-
-
SKELETONS:
Hurray!
-Oh, there she is.
-Here she comes.
Oh, dear.
Quiet down now, everyone.
Mm-hm.
Thank you.
EIegant, cuItured, radiant.
Victoria has found a husband. . .
. . .with aII these quaIities and more.
Serendipity brought us together. . .
. . .and no force on earth
couId tear us apart.
Oh!
Mm?
There's an eye in me soup.
-Ooooh!
-Oh! Oh!
Aaah!
Oh, sorry.
Fetch me musket!
Fetch your own musket. I'm off!
Coming through. Coming through.
Excuse me, you don't know me,
but I used to Iive in your dead mother.
Hey, hoId on there.
I Iove a woman with meat
on her bones. Heh, heh, heh.
Finis, who invited these peopIe?
They must be from your side
of the famiIy.
CertainIy not.
Why, if my Grandfather EvergIot couId
see this, he'd be turning in his grave.
MALE VOICE:
Finis.
Where do you keep the spirits?
In other news. . .
. . .the dead waIk the earth!
Get back! Don't try
and sneak up on me!
Get back!
I'II give you such a waIIop.
No.
Yeah.
Grandpa?
PEOPLE:
Aww. . . .
Huh?
-Bounder!
-Sweetie pie.
-Monster.
-Buttercup.
-Cad!
-Gertrude!
AIfred?
Oh?
You've been dead for 1 5 years.
FrankIy, my dear, I don't give a damn.
EtheI!
Wait. That's it.
We're going to take whatever money
we can and get out of here.
Money? What money?
Your dowry. It's my right!
But my parents don't have any money.
It's my marriage to you that wiII
save them from the poorhouse.
Th-- The poorhouse?
You're Iying. It isn't true.
TeII me that you're Iying!
Did things not go according
to your pIan, Lord Barkis?
WeII, perhaps in disappointment
we are perfectIy matched.
GALSWELLS:
Be gone, ye demons from heII!
Back to the void
from whence you came!
You shaII not enter here.
Back, back!
Keep it down, we're in a church.
Evening.
DearIy beIoved and departed. . .
. . .we are gathered here today to join
this man and this corpse in marriage.
-Victor?
-Shh!
Living first.
With this hand. . .
. . .I wiII Iift your sorrows.
Your cup wiII never empty. . .
. . .for I wiII be your wine.
Now you.
With this hand. . .
. . .I wiII Iift your sorrows.
Your cup wiII never empty.
For I wiII be. . . .
I wiII be. . . .
Go on, my dear.
Your cup. . .
. . .wiII never empty. . .
. . .for I wiII be. . . .
I wiII be your wine.
She's having second thoughts.
I can't.
What's wrong?
This is wrong.
I was a bride.
My dreams were taken from me.
WeII, now. . . .
Now I've stoIen them
from someone eIse.
I Iove you, Victor.
But you're not mine.
Victoria!
BARKIS:
Oh, how touching.
I aIways cry at weddings.
Our young Iovers together at Iast.
SureIy now they can Iive
happiIy ever after.
But you forget. . .
. . .she's stiII my wife!
I'II not Ieave here empty-handed!
You?
EmiIy?
You!
But-- But-- I Ieft you.
For dead.
BARKIS: This woman
is obviousIy deIusionaI!
Sorry to cut things short,
but we must be on our way.
Take your hands off her.
Do I have to kiII you too?
BARKIS:
Aargh!
Victor, catch!
Sorry.
I say, you're not pIaying fair, sir.
Touche, my dear.
Get out.
Oh, I'm Ieaving.
But first a toast. To EmiIy.
AIways the bridesmaid, never the bride.
TeII me, my dear. . .
. . .can a heart stiII break
once it's stopped beating? Hm?
Let me at him! Let me at him!
-No, don't hoId me back.
-Wait.
We must abide by their ruIes.
We are amongst the Iiving.
WeII said.
Ah!
Not anymore.
Yep, you're right. He's aII yours.
New arrivaI.
Oh, Victor,
I never thought I'd see you again.
Wait.
I made a promise.
You kept your promise.
You set me free.
Now I can do the same for you.
