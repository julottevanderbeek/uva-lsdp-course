I AM LOVE
Madam, your son told me
he is bringing a guest.
- A guest?
- Yes. A girl...
So, we have Gratieni
and his wife here,
Betta and Gregorio...
probably... here.
- Between Edo and Delfina.
- Yes.
She should sit next to Edoardo.
She doesn't know anyone.
- Is Edo back?
- Not yet.
- Any news on the race?
- He came in second.
Second?
The snow, Grandpa's birthday,
Edo losing a race...
Three events in just one day!
Maybe this year we'll be spared
Edo's dish.
What do you say, Betta?
Your sister's in a bad mood today.
- What's for breakfast?
- Thanks, Ida.
He's never this late.
He must really like this girl!
Hi, Anita.
- Good morning, Ida.
- Good morning, Edoardo.
- Good morning, Liliana.
- Good morning, Mr. Edoardo.
Here you are, my love.
- Thanks for the soup, Mamma.
- I have to add some saffron.
- Who is she?
- Be nice to her, she's really shy.
Her name is Eva.
Ida is a little jealous.
Edo lost the race today.
He'll have more time
to concentrate on work.
Good morning, Madam.
Good morning, Sir.
- How are you, Ida?
- Very well, thank you. And you?
- You look well.
- Thank you.
Happy birthday.
- Good morning.
- How are you?
Very well, Madam.
And you?
We've been through happier times.
Look how they've grown.
Grandpa!
Elisabetta, how are you?
Fine.
- Nothing for me?
- Happy birthday, Grandpa.
They are here.
When did you get back?
I was a little late.
Who did you lose to today?
Gregorio?
No, to a guy I don't know.
I didn't lose, we tied.
Why didn't you challenge
the judge's ruling?
He deserved the victory.
I spoke to your brother this morning.
It's a pity you weren't there.
Your grandfather's
in an excellent mood today.
- Is this Eva from the Ugolini family?
- Yes, the poor side.
Gianluca, you're even more of a snob
than your father.
More than your grandmother!
Hello, Grandpa. Happy birthday.
It surprises me
that Tancredi gave it to Emma
as a wedding gift.
Tell me, how did you manage
to lose today's race?
It was fixed.
They wanted him out of the running.
I don't think so...
- I was up against someone stronger.
- Impossible!
- The Recchis are unbeatable.
- That's right.
The doctor said we shouldn't worry.
He is fighting with all his strength
and his heart is responding well.
He has decided.
I'm glad you lost the race.
From now on you won't have
any further distractions.
I want to go to London
to see Herzog and De Meuron.
- Who?
- They designed the new Tate Gallery.
The Tate Gallery?
I want to give them the scaffolding
covers for the next project.
- It'd guarantee years of work.
- Are you sure?
- Madam, you look beautiful.
- Thank you.
- How are we doing here?
- Well.
Is everything all right?
Betta, Eva works in Atellani's,
the bookshop on Corso Magenta.
The one below Grandpa's house?
I've never seen you there.
I've not been there long.
I'm in the art department.
- Where is Pierluigi?
- He's coming.
Thank you.
Not Edo's  dish again!
Enough!
No, it's fabulous!
"Ton sur ton".
You're right, Andrea.
"Ton sur ton"
is better than "con sur con"!
Eva, how did the race go?
You were there, right?
The guy who beat Edo is a chef.
- Do you know him?
- No.
But his restaurant is in a building
owned by my family.
- Beaten by a chef?
- It wasn't fair.
- Edo won.
- If you say so...
Shall we go?
- Can I see it?
- Together with the others.
Thanks.
Let's go.
May I have your attention?
I have all of my granddaughter's
drawings on a wall.
When she becomes a famous painter,
I'll have people pay to see them.
What is this?
I took it at the Hanbury Gardens.
You took me there.
I want to move into photography now.
I like it. It's beautiful.
Yes, I like it too.
I'm just thrown by novelties.
I don't think he likes it.
You still owe me a drawing.
Come here.
I like it. It's wonderful.
Really.
Thank you.
For you.
Thank you.
My dear friends,
I don't want to die
and I won't
as long as the business
carries on
in the same spirit
in which I created it.
Our family's fortune
is built on the factory.
Every brick, every man,
every piece of material
is living proof
of what we have been.
We engraved our name
in our country's history
when, both during the war
and after,
we were able to tend to its needs
with our factory's constant,
busy activity.
The company was born Recchi,
and Recchi it must remain forever.
The time has come
for me to retire
and name my successor.
My son has always lived up
to my expectations.
I knew he would from the moment
I first held him in my arms.
Thank you, Tancredi,
for having been
the son I always wanted
and for having created
such a marvelous family.
I see qualities in your children...
that will lead them
to live intense
and fruitful lives, as I have.
Of course, my grandson
had to choose this day
of all days to interrupt
our family's athletic tradition!
Therefore...
I have decided to leave
everything in your hands, Tancredi.
And in your son Edoardo's.
It will take two men
to replace me!
Here's to Tancredi and Edoardo!
To the Recchis!
Come here, you winner!
Go to the cellar.
Bring two bottles of '49.
Yes?
It's for Edoardo Recchi.
- Can I take it?
- I'd prefer to deliver it myself.
- Who are you?
- Antonio Biscaglia.
One moment.
This way.
Follow the path. It'll take you
to the entrance of the villa.
Ida, leave it.
What are you doing here?
That's the chef...
the one who beat Edo.
Come in!
I wanted to bring you a gift.
A gift?
For me? I get it. You're no longer
certain of your victory today.
- You put up a good fight.
- Come in.
It's a special night for my family.
I'd rather not, thanks.
As you wish.
I made you a cake.
I'm a chef.
Mamma!
I want to show you something.
- This is Antonio.
- Good evening.
Look what he made for me.
Isn't it a work of art? He made it.
He's the guy that beat me today.
That's why he doesn't want to stay.
- Please stay.
- It doesn't matter, thanks.
- Are you going to bed, Mamma?
- Yes, my love.
Ida!
I have to take this bottle
to Grandpa - don't let him leave!
- Should the cake go in the fridge?
- No.
Please, come in.
SOME MONTHS LATER
Good morning, Madam.
- How is your son, Edo?
- Fine, thank you.
- Just the blazer?
- Yes, only the blazer.
I've managed to get rid
of those nasty stains.
- It's fine.
- Yes.
This is for you.
Wait, Mrs. Recchi, I found this.
I saved it from the washing machine.
I made it just in time.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
They are the words of a song
that a friend made me listen to.
She's the one in the photo.
Her name is Angaharad.
Antonio!
Antonio?
- Hi, Tom!
- You finally made it!
You told me
there were spectacular views,
but I can't see anything!
You're right, it's lovely here.
- Isn't it a bit too remote?
- Two hours by car.
You're right.
I'm having a party at my house,
for Eva's birthday.
I want to ask her to marry me.
Don't you have anything to say?
- Congratulations.
- A little enthusiasm would be good!
Honestly, I'm happy.
Let's drink to it.
Best wishes!
Try this.
It's eggplant and elderflower,
I extracted the essence from here.
If I did this at the restaurant,
my father'd be mad.
He doesn't understand what I do.
He just thinks of the money.
Imagine a restaurant here.
People would have to climb up
to try my dishes.
The essence of flavors.
As simple as this place.
Do it.
- This is all his, he'd never let me.
- Have you asked him?
He thinks it's madness,
biting off more than I can chew.
He says nobody would come.
- I'll convince him.
- It's not that easy.
Come on, give me a hand.
You've become a real wimp.
Did you invite me here to work?
- Oh, how are you today?
- Doing well, thank you!
- Good morning! How are you?
- Fine, Rachele.
- I'm so glad you've stayed with us.
- Me too, Madam.
She is in a terrible mood,
despite having won the lottery.
Four straight numbers...
I should've listened to her!
- You too?
- I keep her company.
As if coming to my husband's funeral
wasn't enough for her.
She wrote that she shares my sorrow
over Edoardo's death.
Shares what?
My husband was mine alone,
and anything that happened
without me is of no importance!
- Emma!
- Andrea!
She's in a terrible rage!
I have to go.
- Conference call with your husband.
- Goodbye.
Thanks, Emma.
Tancredi called me
from London yesterday.
He is making important decisions.
It was like listening to his father.
He gets more like him every day.
Elisabetta?
She never calls. What is she up to?
She likes the school she has chosen.
She's very busy studying.
- She wanted to come back today...
- Do you like her?
Sorry?
Edo's girlfriend, the Ugolini girl.
Eva? She's very nice.
He seems happy with her.
I wouldn't be surprised
if they made
an important announcement soon.
The perfect wedding for her
and her family.
Marriage: Number 36 on the Lotto.
That should be lucky!
Let's carry on the family tradition.
Give it to her from me.
Thank you.
Ida, it's bustling!
We're almost done, Madam.
The chef's been cooking for two hours.
Mamma!
Why are you here?
Remember Antonio?
You met on Grandpa's birthday.
Yes.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Madam.
Excuse me.
Since I tried his cooking,
I fell in love with him.
Did you prepare all this
on your own?
No, Franco helped me.
Russian salad...
- Why don't you try?
- I don't know how...
- She's a great cook. Go on, Mamma!
- Give it a go. It's not difficult.
- It looks dangerous.
- It isn't.
Be brave.
I'll help you.
- Hi, Franco.
- Good evening.
- Perfect, isn't it?
- Perfect!
Mamma...
Mamma...
Were you sleeping?
Good idea.
You won't get any peace tonight.
Do you miss Russia?
Sometimes.
You know...
great things are happening there.
Sweetheart...
Bye.
- How is the party going?
- Very well, Madam.
Are you tired, Ida?
No, we've had tougher ones.
Anyway, Edo is so happy.
Please sit with me.
Tell me what's going on.
Edo has spent all evening with Eva.
He left her only to try and take
his chef friend away from the kitchen.
He thinks very highly of him.
Luckily, Mr. Tancredi is in London.
He doesn't really like evenings
like these.
- Shall I close the curtains?
- Yes, thanks.
Did you see the wonderful dish
your son's friend sent you?
The party cost more than we'd agreed.
It was a lovely evening.
Edo was so happy.
A shame you weren't there.
Do you think he wants to marry her?
Your mother is convinced.
Elisabetta thinks so too.
How is Betta?
I thought she looked well;
maybe a bit sad.
I think she wants to get back
with Gregorio.
She told me
you're picking her up tomorrow.
Yes, after lunch with Rori.
I have to admit I was wrong. Going to
London was the right thing for her.
She likes it there.
She seems more motivated.
I don't think she will go back
to Gregorio.
She doesn't love him.
Ida?
Here.
What does that mean?
What does Edo think of selling?
He is slowly coming to terms with it.
He can't remain anchored to the past.
Gianluca thinks that selling
is the only sensible option.
And what do you think
about his restaurant idea?
It's his money!
You know what I think
about my father's decision?
Edo isn't at all ready
to make decisions
about the company.
He still needs a lot of guidance.
Edoardo's mother has confirmed
three people for one o'clock.
Yes, I know.
- What's she like?
- Who?
Mrs. Recchi.
Is she a nice person?
She's nice.
Can I have the press?
Thanks.
What are you charging Edo
for the party?
It was my gift to him.
Leghorn-style cod.
This goes onto the menu.
We did it!
Excellent.
The first time my son mentioned Emma
was when we were at La Scala,
on St. Ambrose's feast day.
You were still in Russia.
Tancredi said, "Mamma, I'm marrying
a woman more beautiful than you."
Naturally, I didn't believe him.
To the Recchi wives!
Coming here today was a great idea.
Edo is right to believe
in his friend.
He's a real talent.
I'm worried they're pushing it a bit.
The idea of the restaurant
was rather rushed.
Too much enthusiasm
can cause one not to think straight.
Edoardo is an intelligent man.
He knows what he's doing.
Marinated egg yolk, pea cream
and zucchini flowers;
prawns with ratatouille
and sweet-and-sour sauce;
and mixed fish
with crunchy vegetables.
Enjoy your meal.
Where would you like to live?
I wouldn't mind London.
I know a law firm
where I could be an apprentice.
I love the city...
Welcome, ladies.
Antonio, this is Edo's grandmother.
You already know Emma.
- How do you do?
- An excellent meal.
I heard of your project
with my grandson.
I'd be happy to give my opinion
regarding the furnishing.
Thank you.
And thanks for coming.
They seemed happy.
I think so.
I made prawns for your mother.
I know my father
only listens to you,
but I'll try and tell him.
Rori, excuse me a moment.
Am I interrupting?
- I'd like to thank you. You are great.
- Thanks.
The risotto, the prawns,
the vegetables...
they were exquisite.
- I grow the vegetables myself.
- Really? Where?
Near Sanremo, in the countryside,
where your son and I plan
to set up our restaurant.
How will you manage not being here?
Hey, Franco, let me do that.
Good evening, Madam.
I'll go on Thursdays
when we are closed here,
and between shifts whenever I can.
- See you soon.
- With pleasure.
Here I am!
Mamma! Grandma!
How wonderful to see you.
- How was the trip?
- Fine.
- How are you?
- Very well.
Betta!
Why did you come?
What do you mean, why?
What have you done?
- Goodbye.
- What?
Shall we go?
I'm sorry I missed Eva's party.
Edo's crazy about Antonio, right?
They want to open a restaurant.
He wants me to stop off
on my way to Nice.
- For your exhibition?
- Yes.
- Can I tell you something?
- Of course.
I left Gregorio for her.
It's not a passing thing, I'm sure.
Do you like her?
She's beautiful.
Very beautiful.
I don't want to tell dad,
or Gianluca.
They wouldn't understand.
Here, she looks amazing.
Why don't you come to Nice with me?
- I might.
- We can be together.
Edo, darling...
I'm out of town.
I've decided
to go to see Betta in Nice.
But don't tell her.
I'll call you later.
- I'll be right with you, Madam.
- Thank you.
Mrs. Recchi!
How come you're here?
I'm going to visit Betta.
Oh, the exhibition in Nice.
Edo told me about it.
- How about you?
- The restaurant is closed today.
Right, it's Thursday...
the countryside... the vegetables.
If you aren't too busy,
why don't you come with me?
It's just a slight detour.
I'll show you where Edo and I
will open the restaurant.
He's already been there a few times.
Okay.
My truck's there.
- Were you born here?
- No, my father's from here.
The land is my grandfather's.
I started cooking here as a child.
I love cooking,
but I'm not as good as you.
Edo tells me the opposite.
He always talks about you.
And he talks to me about you.
He'll be happy you came.
