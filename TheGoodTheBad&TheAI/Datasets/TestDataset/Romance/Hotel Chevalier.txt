- Le concierge. Bonsoir, Monsieur Whitman.
Puis-je vous aider?
Bonsoir. S'il vous plait, je voudrais un verre
de lait au chocolat et une soupe d'oignon.
A, uh, sandwich avec-
- How do you say "grilled cheese"?
- Toasts au fromage.
Merci. Exactement.
Merci beaucoup.
- Hello.
-  Hi.
I'm on my way from the airport, and
the front desk won't give me your room number.
What's your room number?
- 403.
- See you in a half an hour.
- Wait a second.
- What?
- Where are you?
- I'm here.
I didn't say you could come here.
Can I come there?
- Okay.
- I'll see you in half an hour.
So who else is coming?
I'll call you later. Bye.
You talk like Marlene Dietrich
-  And you dance like Zizi Jeanmaire
- What's this music?
Your clothes are all made by Balmain
And there's diamonds and pearls
in your hair
Yes, there are
You live in a fancy apartment
Off the Boulevard Saint-Michel
Where you keep
your Rolling Stones records
-  And a friend of Sacha Distel
- How'd you find me?
Yes, you do
It wasn't actually that hard.
But where do you go to, my lovely
When you're alone in your bed
Tell me the thoughts that surround you
I want to look inside your head
Yes, I do
I've seen all your qualifications
You got from the Sorbonne
And the painting you stole from Picasso
Your loveliness goes on and on
Yes, it does
When you go on your summer vacation
You go to Juan-les-Pins
With your carefully designed
topless swimsuit
You get an even suntan
-  On your back and on your legs
-
And when the snow falls
you're found in Saint Moritz
Are you going to take a bath?
It's for you.
And you sip your Napoleon brandy
Who cut your hair?
The barber in the lobby.
But where do you go to, my lovely
When you're alone in your bed
Oh, won't you tell me
the thoughts that surround you
I want to look inside your head
Yes, I do
What the fuck is going on?
Your name, it is heard in high places
You know the Aga Khan
He sent you a racehorse for Christmas
How long have you had this hotel room?
-  Keep it just for fun, for a laugh
- I don't know.
-  Ha-ha-ha
- More than a week?
-  They say that when you get married
- More than a week.
- More than a month?
-  It'll be to a millionaire
- More than a month.
-  But they don't realize where you came from
How much does it cost?
And I wonder if they really care
I think around 750 million euros
or something.
-
-  Where do you go to, my lovely
How long are you going to stay?
-  When you're alone in your bed
- How long are you going to stay?
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.
I want to look inside your head
Yes, I do
I remember the backstreets of Naples
Two children begging in rags
Both touched with a burning ambition
Don't you think it's time
for you to go home?
- Probably.
-  So look into my face, Marie-Claire
Are you running away from me?
And remember just who you are
I thought I already did.
Then go and forget me forever
But I know you still bear the scar
Deep inside, yes, you do
-
-  I know where you go to, my lovely
When you're alone in your bed
- Bonsoir, Monsieur.
-  I know the thoughts that surround you
'Cause I can look inside your head
La, la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
Soupe à l'oignon, toasts au fromage
et chocolat.
-Je vous remercie.
- Thank you.
- Would you order me a Bloody Mary, please?
- Uh — Two Bloody Marys.
- Yes.
- Please.
Have you slept with anyone?
No. Have you?
No.
That was a long pause.
- I guess it doesn't really matter.
- No, it doesn't.
You've got bruises on your body.
Whatever happens, in the end,
I don't want to lose you as my friend.
I promise,
I will never be your friend...
no matter what, ever.
If we fuck,
I'm going to feel like shit tomorrow.
That's okay with me.
I love you.
I never hurt you on purpose.
I don't care.
Want to see my view of Paris?
Okay.
You talk like Marlene Dietrich

You go to Juan-les-Pins
With your carefully designed
topless swimsuit
You get an even suntan
On your back and on your legs
And when the snow falls
you're found in Saint Moritz
With the others of the jet-set
And you sip your Napoleon brandy
But you never get your lips wet
No, you don't
But where do you go to, my lovely
When you're alone in your bed
Oh, won't you tell me
the thoughts that surround you
I want to look inside your head
Yes, I do
Your name, it is heard in high places
You know the Aga Khan
He sent you a racehorse for Christmas
And you keep it just for fun
For a laugh, ha-ha-ha
