I did. I did.
I-I thought I was a cat. Ooh.
Well, kind of, kind of. I-I identified
with cats. Well, I kind of did then.
I wonder why that was.
They're never sure when you try
to stroke them, is that right?
So maybe I was a sad cat.
Was I a sad cat? Because I wonder.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I wonder about cats.
Truly, I did, I did, I did.
'Cause I was a fuddy-duddy.
Fuddy-duddy.
Uh, I kissed them all. Kissed them.
I will always kiss cats. Always did.
If a cat'd let me kiss it,
I'd kiss it.
You know, if I see a cat on the fence
I'll kiss it. Always, always. Didn't I?
Whoo-hoo. Life's a perpetual risk,
isn't it? That's right. I think it is.
Because the point is, I was different
in those days, wasn't I? I was. I was.
I've got to be different again.
Different again.
But can a leopard change its spots?
Who knows?
Whoo-hoo. It's a blood sport.
I think it's a blood sport.
It's true.
It seems to be true.
Or is it a blank?
Bit of a scrabble. Huh-huh-huh.
You've got to put all the pieces
together, see if you can make a word.
Ohh, that's funny.
That's funny. That's funny.
It's a mystery.
It's a mystery.
I hope you enjoyed your evening.
- Really.
- Bye! Take care.
-  Good seeing you.
-  Bye-bye.
We're closed!
-
-
- What's the problem, mate?
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, mate.
I'm the problem. I think
I'm the problem. Oh, such a problem.
And wet! Oh. But it's not an
ideal world. Is it an ideal world?
I mean, we just have to make the most
of it. This is the way we find it.
Yeah, yeah. But I mean, oh, it's more
ideal than it was because, I mean,
we're privileged, aren't we,
because not long ago
people would be burned by stake.
- Moby, yeah!
- No, it's Tony. Who are you?
Tony, Tony, Tony.
Not Moby. Tony.
Who am I, Tony? Who knows, Tony?
I don't know myself. Ha!
- I'm David. I'm David, Tony.
How does that sound?
- Hi, David.
- How can Sylvia help?
- Sylvia. Is it Sylvia?
Sylvia! Pleased to meet you.
Schubert, Schubert, Schubert,
wasn't it? He said,
"Who is Sylvia? What is she?"
- 'Course you do.
- What can we do for you, David?
Do for me? Do for me? What?
L-l... gotta... gotta stop talking.
- It's a problem, isn't it?
- No, it's all right.
You just tell Sylvia why you're here.
- Oh, well, it's a mystery.
It's a mystery.
- Are you lost?
Perhaps that's it. I'm lost, I'm lost,
I'm lost. How does that sound?
Oh, is that your piano, Sylvia?
Beautiful Sylvia.
Isn't Sylvia beautiful, Toby? Not Toby.
Tony, Tony. You're beautiful too, Tony.
Ohh! Perhaps I could play it.
Could I play it? Could I play it?
- You say. You say.
-  Oh, like hell, baby.
- Shut up, Sam.
- Hell, baby. Whoa, oh, the devil.
Diablerie. Sam.
- David.
- Get out of here. Go on!
Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia,
Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia.
- You just tell us who you are
and where you live.
- Could I play? Could I?
Live, live, live and let live, Sylvia.
That's very important.
But then again it's a lifelong struggle.
Sylvia, Tony, Tony, Sylvia.
To survive. To live.
To survive undamaged...
and not to destroy
any living, breathing creature.
If you do something wrong you can
be punished for the rest of your life.
- It's a lifelong struggle.
Is it a lifelong struggle?
- Yup.
Whatever you do,
it's a struggle, struggle
to keep your head above water...
- and not get it chopped off.
-
I'm not disappointing you,
am I, Sylvia, Tony?
- Sam. Yes, Sam. Oh, Sam!
- No! Get off!
Helfgott... what a name! Ha!
Sorry, Sylvia, I sound like a donkey.
Helfgott..."With the help of God."
That's what it means, Sylvia.
You see,
Daddy's daddy was very religious,
very strict and a bit of a meanie.
But he got exterminated, didn't he?
So God didn't help him. Ha-ha!
That's not very funny.
It's very sad, really. I'm callous.
Daddy says callous. And a bit
of a meanie. Sorry, Sylvia.
- I'm not damaging you, am I?
-  No.
- The point is, perhaps
I haven't got a soul.
- What makes you say that?
- Daddy says so. He says there's
no such thing as a soul.
- That's ridiculous.
Ridiculous? You're right. Ha-ha.
I'm ridiculous, Sylvia and Tony.
And callous. Daddy said callous.
Ridiculous and callous.
Because it was a tragedy. A tragedy.
A ridiculous tragedy.
I'm gonna win. I'm gonna win.
I'm gonna win.
- I'm gonna win.
-
David's going to play the piano for us.
Aren't you, David?
- Yes.
- What are you going to play?
David? David?
- What are you going to play?
- Excuse me.
Chopin. The Polonaise.
This is a disgrace.
The piano. The piano!
- It's a disgrace. The piano.
- This kid's good.
He's great!
He's my son.
My son.
Here they come.
Did he win or lose?
- Margaret?
- He lost.
Now we'll cop it.
- It's your turn.
- Huh?
It's your turn, Daddy.
Well, let me see.
Let me see.
Let me see.
Let me see.
You're losing. You're losing.
David, always win.
Always... win.
You know, when l... when I was
a boy your age, I bought a violin.
A beautiful violin.
And I saved for this violin.
You know what happened to it?
Yes. He smashed it.
Yeah. He smashed it.
David, you're
a very lucky boy.
My father never
let me have music.
I know.
A very lucky boy. Say it.
I'm a very lucky boy.
Very... lucky.
Now shall I play for you?
No. Pick up those pieces.
-  Bet I could have won.
- You'd have been too scared.
-
- Shh!
-
- David! Shh!
Listen. Have a listen.
Margaret! I told you,
tell your friends not to come.
- Good boy.
- Hello.
Daddy,
there's somebody here!
Hello. I hope
I'm not interrupting.
- Uh, Ben Rosen. I was one of the judges.
- Yes?
You left before all
the prizes were announced.
- You were very good
this afternoon, David.
- Thank you.
-  He can play better.
- Maybe he was too good.
Some people
don't like that.
We, uh... We gave him
a special prize for his courage.
- It's a difficult piece
you chose, David.
- Daddy chose it.
Well, even great pianists think
twice before tackling the Polonaise.
- A prize for losing.
- I wouldn't call him a loser.
They all...
They all play.
I'm quite sure...
David could win lots of competitions
with the right tuition.
- My card.
- I teach him.
- Yeah, you've obviously
done very well.
- Yeah. No one taught me.
No music teachers,
Mr Rosen.
No, of course.
It's just, uh...
It's just a few bad habits
can sometimes mean the difference...
between winning or losing.
Oh, perhaps you'd, uh...
you'd like to think about it.
Rachmaninoff.
It's beautiful.
Yeah. You taught yourself?
From the record.
Ah, yeah. It's...
It's very difficult.
It's very difficult.
It's the hardest piece
in the world, you know.
Will you teach me?
You know, one day
you will play it.
You will make me very proud.
Very proud.
Won't you, David?
Yes.
Hmm.
And, uh, next time,
what are we going to do?
- We're going to win?
- We're going to win, yes.
So... good night.
Good night, Daddy.
Come. Come, come, come, come.
Hey, don't touch it.
Don't touch it.
- Yes?
- Mr Rosen, I have decided.
I would like you
teach David.
This.
Rachmaninoff?
Don't be ridiculous.
But he can
play it already.
He's just a boy. How can he express
that sort of passion?
You are a passionate man,
Mr Rosen.
You will teach him, no?
No. I will teach him
what I think is best.
Rachmaninoff is best.
But... you're his teacher.
I'll let you decide.
Thank you.
We'll start with Mozart.
Mr Rosen, I can't
afford to pay.
- Come on, David. Sylvia's getting wet.
- Oh, sorry, Sylvia.
- Bye-bye, Tony, bye. Oh!
It's raining cats and dogs.
- See you later.
Dogs and pussycats!
Ho, ho, ho, ho! Oh, look out!
-
-
- You'll be all right then?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
Thank you. This is it.
- Home sweet home.
- Oh, you can play.
Oh, kind of, kind of, kind...
kind of play. Kind, sweet Sylvia.
Chopin, Sylvia. Chopinzee.
The Pole. Popolski.
Like Daddy and his family
before they were concentrated.
- How long have you been here?
- Golly, a few years,
I think. Eons, I suppose.
How does that sound? And Schubert.
Nothing wrong with Schubert.
Except syphilis.
Was it syphilis? I think it was.
Then he got typhoid on top of that,
so that was the end of him. We lost him.
That was a bit careless of us.
Ha! We lost him.
- So you're back?
- Oh, Jim, Jim,
I've been a naughty boy.
- Been a naughty boy.
- I was about to send out
a search party.
Oh, a party.
I won't be invited again.
He came into my restaurant
and seemed a bit lost, so...
He's very good at that.
Thanks for bringing him home.
- We'll have a party tomorrow.
Time for wine, a very fine time.
- Bye, David.
A mardi gras
and a nice long cigar.
-
-
The winner
and our youngest-ever state champion,
David Helfgott.
-
- Rosen! We won! We won!
Thanks to Mozart. Hmm?
- And now he can play Rachmaninoff.
-
And now to present David with the
prize money, our very special guest...
from America,
ladies and gentlemen,
currently on tour in Australia,
Mr Isaac Stern.
Isaac... Isaac Stern.
You have a very
special talent, David.
Oh, thank you, thank you,
Mr Stern. So do you.
-
- How much are you prepared
to give to your music, David?
Uh... how much?
- David! Everything! Everything!
- Shh.
Uh, everything.
But, uh, I do like tennis
and chemistry too.
-
- And do you play tennis
as well as you play Mozart?
Uh, uh, I just play
up against the wall at home.
I bounce the ball
against the wall mainly.
How would you like to go
to a special school in the States...
- where music bounces off the walls?
- America?
You know, uh, land
of the free, home of the brave?
Mickey Mouse?
Ladies and gentlemen, what an honour
for our young state champion.
- An invitation to study in America.
-
And now, all the way from America,
David Helfgott!
- Thank you. Thank you.
- He's not from America.
Well, he's going to America
and when he comes back,
he'll be coming from there.
Won't you, David?
- I suppose so.
- Margaret!
No, I have no money
to send David to America.
Well, uh, we'll raise it.
What?
Bar mitzvah. David hasn't
yet had his bar mitzvah.
Religion is nonsense.
It's also a gold mine
if you know where to dig.
Then one day I-I'll play
with an orchestra.
Wow! Can I come
when you do?
You can ride
in my Cadillac.
Where are you gonna live
in America?
Hmm. It's a nice
Jewish family, they said.
This is not a nice family?
Oh. Oh, yes, Daddy,
it's very nice.
You're very lucky
to have a family, David.
-
-
I've gotta go.
- It's one of the finest
music schools in the world.
- It is for his father to decide.
He would be well looked after,
I assure you.
Rachel, please. David could be one of
the truly great pianists.
He is just a boy, Mr Rosen.
He still wets his bed.
Take this one,
the brown one.
You see how fit I am,
how strong?
Show me where the lion scratched you
when you worked at the circus, Daddy.
Oh, yes. Come.
Look. Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.
Yeah. That's what happens when you
get too close to the bars, eh?
David? David. Come. Come.
- Hit me.
-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
As hard as you can.
- I wanna hit you, Daddy!
- You too, you too!
As hard as you can.
- You see, a man of steel.
-
No one can hurt me, because
in this world only the fit survive.
The weak get crushed like insects.
Like grasshoppers, Daddy.
Believe me, if you want
to survive in America,
you have to be fit and strong.
-  Like you, Daddy.
- Yeah!
Like me. Yes.
- Yeah. That's good.
-
See you next week, David.
Don't forget to study.
Thank you, Rabbi.
Mr Helfgott,
it is exciting, isn't it?
David, the Lord Mayor
is dying to meet you.
- Peter.
- Mr Rosen.
-  Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention?
- Thank you.
No, thank you.
I would like to thank
our wonderful Lord Mayor...
for establishing this fund
to send David to America.
And now, to play for us,
our very own David Helfgott!
I'm sure you'll find him very good.
...the night of the state finals.
These people are a disgrace.
They think they are so important.
What do they know with their furs
and their diamonds?
It makes me sick
to the stomach.
And Rosen, what kind
of man is he?
He's not married.
He has no children.
Don't ever talk to me about Rosen.
He only wants for David
the same as you have always wanted.
Don't ever compare me to him. What has
he suffered? Not a day in his life.
What does he know?
Does he know about families?
About how your sisters died?
And my mother and father?
Thank you. Thank you, David.
Thank you, Comrade Helfgott.
Your son
is a credit to you.
On behalf of the Soviet
Friendship Society,
we applaud you!
- How are you?
- Meet Katherine Prichard.
- You played beautifully.
- Uh, thank you.
My name's Sonia.
- Uh, I'm David.
- I know who you are.
You've got the most
wonderful hands.
So do you.
So, um, are you...
you're going to America?
That's right. Yeah.
Maybe one day you'll...
you'll go to Russia too.
- Why not?
-
David.
Uh, uh, I'm here.
There's someone important
who wants to meet you.
I better go.
I've never met anyone who plays
the piano as beautifully as you, David.
I've never met a writer
before, Mrs Prichard.
- You must be very proud of him.
- As proud as a father can be.
- I have a long-suffering
old piano at home.
- Ah, a suffering piano?
From neglect. Perhaps you'll come
and play it for me one day.
Well, yes.
A-Anything to help.
- I'd like that very much.
- Me too.
-
- Your attention, comrades.
- I wish to propose a toast...
- That's my cue.
- To our founder and very
special guest this evening,
- Excuse me.
- Katherine Suzannah Prichard.
-
You will learn much from this old woman.
She has been to Soviet Union.
Am... America!
"We've been informed
of your exceptional talent...
and can only say how privileged we feel
to have you come and stay with us.
-
- We're sure you'll feel
very much at home here...
and you'll be pleased to know we're
having the Bosendorfer tuned especially.
- We eagerly await
your 'innement' arrival..."
-  lmminent.
I wonder if they've got
a Cadillac.
"Lmminent arrival, and look forward
to hearing you play for us.
Kindest wishes.
Simon and Basha Mickleburg."
- Read it again! Read it again!
- Shush! You'll wake the baby.
"You'll enjoy the company
of our parakeet and
our poodle called Margaret."
-
- Pig! It is not!
-  It is too.
- Enough! Enough!
Turn it off!
Give me the letter.
-
- David is not going anywhere.
Daddy.
What are you looking at, you fools?
He is not going to America.
I won't let anyone
destroy this family!
Please, Daddy, don't.
I know, David, what is best
because I'm your father.
I'm your father,
and this is your family!
- David! David, come back!
-
-
- Come back!
I know what's best.
Believe me.
Close the door!
Mr Rosen!
Mr Rosen, please! It's David!
Mr Rosen!
Time to get out, David.
It's my turn for the bath.
Are you feeling better now?
Have you stopped shivering?
You know, a bath is always
the best, David. Always.
Disgusting animal.
To shit in the bath,
to do this to me.
You disgusting animal!
Peter.
I know you can hear me.
Don't do this to David.
You mustn't stop him going. Peter!
Whatever you do,
don't you dare inflict
bloody Rachmaninoff on him.
He's not ready!
David, my boy.
It's a terrible thing
to hate your father.
You know,
life is cruel, but...
but music...
music, it will always,
always be your friend.
Everything else
will let you down.
In the end, everything.
Believe me, everything.
Don't hate me.
Life is cruel,
but you have...
you have to...
you have to survive.
You have to survive.
Say it.
You have to survive, Daddy.
You have to survive.
No one... will love you like me.
You can't trust anyone.
But I will always...
be there.
David, come here.
I will always be with you,
forever and ever.
Forever and ever, Daddy.
Each time you play for me,
it expresses
so completely the...
inexpressible.
- Is that good?
- It's divine.
Inexpressibly divine.
Uh, quite.
-
- Tell me a story, Katherine.
What's the story today?
A new story.
Drops of water.
- Raindrops.
- Yes, raindrops.
Perfect.
I shall treasure this
'til the day I die.
"To you, all these wild
weeds and wind flowers of my life...
I bring, my lord,
and lay them at your feet.
They're not frankincense
or myrrh.
But you are Krishna,
Christ and Dionysus...
in your beauty,
tenderness and strength."
That was
our final contestant, David Helfgott,
with a very stirring
Rachmaninoff.
Well, what a close
contest we have...
with the national championship
almost certain to go to one
of the two pianists.
Bravo, David.
I dare say it's going to be difficult
for the judges to separate them,
either one
a worthy winner.
The judges
are now conferring.
- It's a tough game, isn't it, Roger?
- It's a blood sport.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm pleased to announce...
the winner of this year's
instrumental and vocal competition.
Our new
national champion is...
- Roger Woodward.
-
What was he like, Katherine?
Your father.
Oh.
He was forever busy
in his study.
"Go away, Kattie, I'm writing,"
he'd always say.
One day,
oh, I was very young,
I got so annoyed...
that I upset the ink pots
all over his desk...
and scrawled on his work,
pages of it.
When he saw it, he just stood there
seething with anger.
I could feel it.
"What are you doing?"
He shouted.
Well, there was this
terrible silence.
And I just stared at him and said,
"Go away, Daddy, I'm writing."
Well, he ran at me
and he picked me up...
and he cuddled me breathless!
My first literary effort,
he always called it.
David, what is it?
Royal College of Music.
A scholarship.
Oh, David,
that's marvellous.
Daddy won't cuddle me,
Katherine. Oh, no.
He can't stop you, David.
He's such an angry lion, Katherine.
Oh, nonsense. He's a pussycat.
I'll miss you.
These were for my son,
but you'd better have them.
It gets very, very cold
in London.
David?
Where have you been?
Uh, I missed the train.
That Prichard woman.
- What is this? The gloves.
-
Look at me.
Look at me!
And you think you can
just do as you please?
- Uh, I wa... I wanna go,
and y-you can't stop me.
- What?
- I'm your father...
-
Who has done everything
for you... everything!
You cruel,
callous boy!
- Mom! Margaret! Mom!
- Stupid! Stupid boy!
- Leave him! Leave him!
- Leave me alone.
Go, go, go, go. Let him go!
If you want to go, go!
- I'll call the police!
-
Stop it!
He's all right.
Are you all right, David?
Are you all right?
Yeah? Come on, David.
It's all right.
I'm old enough
to make up my own mind.
He thinks he's going
to London.
I've been accepted into
the Royal College of Music.
What do you think is going to happen
to you in London?
David.
If you go,
- you will never come back
into this house again.
-
You will never be
anybody's son.
The girls will lose
a brother.
Is that what you want?
You want...
You want to destroy
the family?
I'm so... I'm sorry.
David. David, if you love me,
you will stop this nonsense.
You will not step out
that... that door.
David.
If you go,
you will be punished...
for the rest of
your life, my David.
Don't go.
Sorry. I'm sorry.
David! Don't make me do it!
He has the most fantastic hands.
Not connected to anything
above his shoulders.
- Oh, he's a bit fragile, certainly.
- "Chopinzee."
I've seen enough to suggest that he can
make the finals in the concerto trials.
What have you seen, Cecil?
- Moments of genius.
- Genius?
Really.
Come on, David.
Boldness of attack.
-
- Ohh!
- Diablerie!
- Whoa.
- The devil, David.
- Mustn't break the piano, eh?
- Liszt broke plenty of strings.
- Right, right, right.
-
- Come on. Fill in for this
useless arm of mine.
The notes first.
The interpretation comes on top of them.
On top. Yes, yes, yes.
You agree, do you?
Oh, yes. I always
agree, Professor.
- Is that wise?
- I-I don't know. Is it?
Don't forget...
it's on the page!
Yes. Well, the notes are on the page,
but, uh, not the feeling.
The emotion.
That's what I feel.
You mustn't sacrifice everything to
emotion. It's all a question of balance.
Ah, yes. Is that
the question, Professor?
Precisely.
I thought so.
That's what I thought.
- Mr Helfgott? Your allowance cheque.
- Thank you, Mr Wright.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I'll just stand still if you like.
- Be careful, David.
- Ohh. By all means, Sarah.
- You look lovely today, Sarah.
- Thank you, David.
- You too, Muriel.
- Ease up, Helfgott, hmm? Sarah!
David, you missed
the bank. Pity.
You'll have to wait
until tomorrow.
- Can't bank on the bank.
- We know someone who can cash it.
- Do we, Robert?
- What are friends for?
Before this dance
Has reached the end
Ba-ba-ba-ba-bah
Ba-ba-ba-bah
To you across the floor
My love I'll send
Ba-ba-ba-ba-bah
Ba-ba-ba-bah
I just hope and pray
That I'll find
the way to say
Can I dance with you
Ba-ba-ba-ba-bah
Ba-ba-ba-bah
Gotta concentrate, Kath...
Gotta concentrate, Katherine.
Gotta practise, practise,
practise.
Because there's three important
things Professor Parkes says,
and that's work, work, work.
A-A-And, uh,
so that's what I have to do...
if I'm gonna, uh, m-make the finals
to the Concerto Medal...
because the winner of which gets
to play at the Royal Albert Hall,
which is
right outside the window.
So I bought a piano, Katherine.
A-A beautiful piano. It's,
it's a suffering piano, like yours.
I-I wrote to Daddy,
so, uh, that's, uh,
a positive.
It's, uh, a positive,
isn't it, because, well...
It seems to be because, uh, he didn't
write back, but...
Now, how on earth did we manage
to get in the finals, dear David?
- You're a conductor's nightmare.
- It's true, it's true.
And what are we gonna do?
We're gonna win, actually, Robert.
We're gonna win.
Rachmaninoff? Are you sure?
Uh, kind of. I'm-I'm never really sure
about anything, Mr Parkes.
The Rach 3.
It's monumental.
It's, uh, it's a mountain. It's the, uh,
hardest piece you could "Everest" play.
Well, no one's ever been
mad enough to attempt the Rach 3.
Um, am I mad enough,
Professor?
Am I?
Think of it as two separate melodies
jousting for supremacy.
The hands... giants.
Ten fingers each.
Performing's a risk, you know.
No safety net.
Make no mistake, David.
It's dangerous.
People get hurt.
-
- You have to learn to be able
to play it blindfolded.
The page, for God's sake!
The notes!
Sorry, I was, uh,
forgetting them, Professor.
Would it be asking too much
to learn them first?
- And then forget them.
- Precisely.
Just give me the fingering.
David. Come on, my boy.
We're going to rest our muscles
and fingers today.
Try to exercise
the imagination.
First movement. Cadenza.
Let's pick it up from, uh...
Your hands must form
the unbreakable habit...
of playing the notes so that
you can forget all about them.
Then let it come from here.
The heart.
That's where it comes from.
Don't you just love
those big, fat chords?
You have to tame the piano, David,
or it'll get away from you.
It's a monster. Tame it,
or it'll swallow you whole.
-
-
Coming along nicely, David.
Morning, Mrs Perkins.
Katherine.
I call this my little
mausoleum, David.
Ah. Liszt.
Warts and all.
- They made this after he was dead.
- Mmm.
Poor Franz.
Dead as a post, eh?
You can still get these on the
Left Bank, you know. Quite cheap.
I've got Rachmaninoff
in here somewhere.
Ah.
Magnificent fingers.
So virile.
You know, I played the Rach 3
for him once.
Really?
Yes.
He said he could hear
himself in my playing.
Said it seemed...
as if I'd touched his soul.
That wasn't so bad, was it?
No, not too bad at all, Professor.
Now it's your turn, David.
Remember,
once you've done it, nobody
can ever take it away from you.
And you must play...
as if there was
no tomorrow.
-
-
Come on, David.
Don't let me down.
How many moments
of genius today, Cecil?
-
-
Bravo!
Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo!
Bravo! Bravo!
-
-
-
-
Hello? Who is this?
- Hello!
- Daddy?
Daddy, I'm home.
Daddy?
Hello? Daddy?
Someone here
to see you, David.
It's me, David. Suzie.
Suzie? Suzie?
Do we know Suzie?
- Your sister, David.
- Oh, sister Suzie. Sister Suzie.
Thank you, sister.
Sister nurse. Sister Suzie.
David, I won't be able
to come and visit so often.
Not so often, sweet-sweet,
soft Suzie. Not so often.
- I'm going to live in Melbourne.
- Oh, that's a trick. Don't tell Daddy.
The milk... The milk mustn't
cry over spilt milk.
- Ah, well, what can you do,
Margaret? What can you do?
- Margaret's in Israel, remember?
I remember Margaret.
She called me dopey. Or was it a pig?
It was a poodle. It was a poodle.
It was a poodle.
It was all very complicated,
wasn't it? Complicado in Israel.
It was... It was a battle ground;
war zone. It was a war.
Such a bore. Such a bore.
It was a war. It was a war.
It just destroys everything,
really, doesn't it?
- David!
- That's right, nurse.
- I knew I'd find you here.
- I've been a naughty boy
again, haven't I?
- I-I misbehaved, haven't I,
nurse? I think I have.
- Come on, David.
I-I might get into trouble.
I might get punished for the rest
of my life 'cause I'm flawed.
- I'm fatally flawed.
That's right, isn't it?
- You silly sausage.
Because it's-it's forbidden fruit.
The doctor says it's forbidden fruit.
I'm not disappointing
you, am I? Am I disappointing you?
The thing is you-you...
He didn't approve, did he?
He was very disapproving.
Oh! Very disapproving. They'd all
scuttle away and leave me there.
Come on, Charlie.
Let's put it over here, shall we?
- Oh, so you can read music?
- Kind of. Kind of.
Perhaps I'm just turning over a new
leaf. But that's all right, isn't it?
My name is Beryl Alcott.
What's yours?
Alcott. That sounds a lot like my name:
Helfgott. That's my name. Helfgott?
That's right. Ridiculous. It means
"with the help of God". It's ridiculous.
- I like this tune.
- What's your first name, Mr Helfgott?
Oh, yes, first things first, Beryl.
David. I'm David. How does that sound?
-
- You're David Helfgott?
That's right, Beryl.
That's right.
But I used to watch you win
all those competitions.
Oh, win some, lose some. You can't
lose 'em all. It's not your fault.
I was quite a fan.
Do you still play?
Oh, I mustn't. Doctor said I mustn't.
All end in tears if I misbehave.
I mustn't "haranguevate" the doctor.
I mustn't. That's right. Is that right?
Because it might damage me.
The doctor said it might damage
me because of the long time...
once before, long, long,
long time ago.
That's the story. So what can you do?
See you play, Beryl. Come on, you play.
Boldness of attack.
Oh, that's good, Beryl.
That's good.
Oh, very good left hand.
Very good left hand.
Point is you've got to share and care
and care and share and behave.
That's right, yes.
This is going to be a stylish marriage.
A stylish marriage,
Beryl. It's a stylish marriage.
Oh, that's very good, Beryl.
Very good. Mm, that's very good.
-
- Oh, that's very good.
Press those pedals.
Oh, we're riding the bicycle.
Beryl. Pedal, Beryl, pedal.
- What goes on in his head?
- God only knows.
- He's pretty confusing
at the best of times.
- It's not serious, is it?
It's a complex disorder. He kind of
lives in his own little world.
- Poor lost soul.
- Mm, he's a sweetie.
He could leave tomorrow
if he had somewhere to go.
- Come along, David.
- Beryl, Beryl, Beryl.
- David, you know I can't abide smoke.
- Oh, sorry, Beryl. Sorry.
- What are you doing?
- Well, I'll walk.
- But you don't know the way.
- I'll follow you. How does that sound?
It's all right. Get in, David.
God bless you, David Helfgott.
How's this, Beryl?
Is this all right?
Whoa-oh!
- Is that you, nurse?
- It's all right, David. I'm here.
Here, here, never fear. But where's
the nurse? Where's the sister, Beryl?
- This is where you live now, David.
- Oh, that's right.
I'm fine. I'm fine. Aren't I,
Daisey? Daisey Beryl Daisey.
This is where David Helfgott
really gets back on the rails.
- Oh, that's the story. That's the story.
- No.
- Mmm.
- Nah.
-
-
Oh, don't you just love
those big fat chords, Beryl?
The Botanical Gardens is
just down the road. Nice walk.
You'll be able to come and go
as you please.
Mr Minogue's a lovely man.
A real Christian gentleman.
I know you're going to
like him, David.
And guess what?
You'll even have your own piano.
Very, very, very feathery.
Very feathery. Very light.
-
-  Shut up!
-
-  Good morning, David.
Wakey-wakey. Rise and shine.
It's breakfast time.
I think it's about time we gave
the piano another rest, eh, David?
Here, sign your cheque.
Ah, look at ya.
You should get out and exercise.
- Exercise, yes, that's right.
- Get some fresh air into
those lungs of yours, David.
Because the weak get crushed like
insects, don't they? Like grasshoppers.
Whoa-oh!
Whoa!
Well, thank you,
thank you, thank you.
I hope you enjoyed
the music.
- It was great. Bye.
-
- See you.
- Take care.
Bye-bye.
We're closed.
-
-
Sylvia, your stray dog's back.
- You want me to get rid
of him for you?
- No, I'll handle it.
Hey, baby,
what about a tune?
A tune, baby.
Sure, no worries. No worries.
Bravo. Bravo. Encore.
Oh, sock it to us, Liberace.
-
- That's enough. David?
-
- That was fantastic!
Bravo!
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
Two more when
you're ready, mate.
Yeah!
Maestro!
Fantastic!
Thank you. Thank you.
Ah, thanks, love.
Oh, a hot one. A live one.
- Hey, give us "Beethoven's Fifth."
- Sure, baby. No worries.
Symphony or Concerto?
I played quite well tonight, didn't I?
I played quite well.
- I deserve a bit of a snack.
A bit of a snack. You say...
-
Hello, David.
Hello, Daddy. Uh, hello.
Are you feeling well?
Well, well, well. The thing is-is...
I can't... I can't open it.
- There's something wrong with it.
- What could be wrong, David?
It's a mystery.
It's a mystery.
Close it.
Give it to me. I'll show you.
- Hmm. Here.
-
Hmm.
Mm. You see...
how easy it is?
Couldn't be... Couldn't be easier.
That's right. Couldn't be easier.
David?
Here. Here.
Come here.
Look at me.
You are a lucky boy, David.
That's true. That's true.
It seems to be true.
- People say that-that they think
that I'm that-that...
- David.
Get to the point.
Yeah, I'm a very lucky boy.
No one will love you like me.
No one... like me.
You see.
Do you realize what
an opportunity you have here?
- Opportunity for a lifetime,
that's right, Daddy.
- David.
When I was a boy...
l... I bought a violin.
Beautiful violin.
I saved...
for this violin.
Now, you know, what...
what happened to it...
You know what happened to it?
No, what happened to it, Daddy?
I don't... no idea what happened.
I've got no idea.
The thing... The thing is you've
got to be... you've got to be
fit to survive to stay alive.
That's right, isn't it?
Good night, Daddy.
- Where are the kids?
- Oh, around somewhere
amusing themselves.
I must warn you, I've got someone
staying on weekends.
- But not another Scorpio, is he?
- Very funny, Gills.
He's a child prodigy.
-
- David!
- Ah, thanks.
- It's a madhouse.
David!
-
-  Is that the water running?
David!
David. David?
Where in God's heaven is he?
- Mum!
- Mum! David's been on
for an hour straight.
-  He's so cool.
-
- David.
- Is that you, Doctor?
There's no more hot water.
- Where does it go?
- I want you to meet someone.
There's no more hot water.
It's all gone. All gone.
Where does it go? Who can say?
Where does hot water go?
- David, Gillian's
a very dear friend of mine.
- Oh, a friendly doctor.
- Pleased to meet you, David.
- I feel better already.
- She's not a doctor.
She's an astrologer.
- Not a doctor.
- Oh, a heart specialist.
- She's from Sydney.
- An open heart surgeon.
-  Don't be ridiculous.
- I'm ridiculous. Gillian, that's it.
- Gillian.
- If you're lucky, Gillian might
do your chart for you.
- Oh, would she?
- You will one day?
- Of course I will. Yes.
- What sort of charts?
- Astrological chart.
- Oh, the stars. Astronomical variations.
- And the planets.
Oh, the planets.
Mustn't forget the planets.
Mercury and Neptune and so forth.
- The music of the spheres.
If music be the food of love...
-
Very gastronomical, isn't it?
Oh, the food of love, it is. Ohh.
- What's he like when
he gets to know you better?
- Ohh. O-O-hhh.
- So what does he do?
- Oh, he's an investment advisor.
That's how I met him.
Oh, so far so good.
How serious is it?
- Ahh.
- Oh, come on, Gills.
On a scale of one to ten?
Mm.
I'll take that as a ten.
When's the happy day?
God, you know me.
I hate to rush into things.
I won't kiss you.
Oh, darling, oh.
Oh, Trish, Trish,
Trish, Trish.
Lovely, gorgeous hair. Blondes have
more fun, don't they? 'Course they do.
There you are, doctor.
Oh, that's sparkly.
That's sparkly.
Got to go to my room.
Got to go to my room.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thanks for everything.
Oh, good night, Lucy. Oh, Juicy Lucy.
- Mind if I come in?
- Oh, hello, Doctor. Entre. Entre.
Where will I put these?
Oh, sorry.
It's not your fault. It's amazing.
It just seems to be getting bigger.
It's amazing what you find when you're
not even looking. But there he is.
- Who?
- Roger. Roger.
- Oh, Roger Woodward.
- Oh, Roger. Roger. Yeah, he's a winner.
- He's a winner.
- You've got one going already.
He's a... He's a big hit.
He's a b-big hit.
- There.
- Oh, one's more than enough.
Yeah. I really loved
your playing.
- Did you? Did you? It was all right?
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you write music as well?
- Oh, no, one, two, three.
That's the Rach 3.
- It started out being a letter.
- L-think it was. I think so.
It seems to be true.
"Dear Professor Cecil,
Royal College."
- Of music. Royal College Of Music.
That's a mystery.
- What is?
- Well, he only had one arm.
It was a stroke.
- Poor thing.
Poor, poor pussycat.
Poor pussycat.
He's... His paw was damaged
beyond repair. He wasn't
able to do a thing with it.
He was a sad, sad pussycat. He was...
He was damaged. Just bad luck, really.
- I'm not damaging you, am I?
- Oh, no, not at all.
- What's the matter, David?
- Oh, the matter.
The matter... Well, it started out
being... But it's a blank. It's a blank.
It was all such a long,
long, long time ago.
That's the story. What can you do?
Inexpressible.
Inexplicably inexpressible.
To express the inexplicable.
Why don't you tell me
what you want to say?
Why not? What I don't want to say.
Oh, that's a hard one.
No, it's not hard at all.
Look. "D-E-A-R. Dear."
- That's it. That's it.
- Dear, Cecil? Cecil?
- Parkes. Cecil was Parkes. Mr Parkes.
- Dear, Mr Parkes.
He touched the soul of Sergei
Vasilievitch with the Rach 3 in D-Minor.
It's a hard piece.
Piece for elephants. Elephantine.
- Dear, Mr Parkes.
- It's all such a long time ago.
- It has been such a long time.
- Such a long time.
- And l...
- Oh. And l... And I hope... Hope,
Gillian. How does that sound?
- Sounds pretty good to me.
- And I hope you remember me
and the Rach 3.
I'm feeling much better again. I'm
feeling much better again, aren't I?
- And I've started playing again.
-
Bravo!
Well done, Roger! Ooh, yeah. Oh.
It was good?
-  Smile, David.
- Come on.
- I am, Sylvia.
- In the camera, here.
- Ooh. Hurray.
- Hurray.
- Time to go.
- Well, what can you do?
- David, look on the bright side.
You'll see Gillian again.
- The bright side.
- Yes, life goes on.
- It does. Is that what it does?
- Yes, of course it does.
- David, she has to go.
- Little "Rigleys" to look after.
- Well, hardly. My kids are all grown up.
- It's just little old me.
- It's just me too.
I never grew up. I grew down.
- I'm a bit of a handful. Aren't I?
- Shh, shh.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Shh.
Will you marry me?
Well, it wouldn't be
very practical, David.
Not practical, no, of course not.
Then neither am I.
- I'm not very practical at all.
-  You'll miss the plane!
It's sweet of you, David.
- I don't know what to say.
- The stars, Gillian. Ask the stars.
-  You'd better
let her breathe, David.
-  Hooray!
-
-
I won't kiss you.
I won't kiss you.
- Ohhh.
-
Funi, Funi, Funiculi
Funi, Funi, Funicula
Funiculi
Funicula
Sorry, darling.
Mmm. That's all right.
- You made a noise, honey. Ooo-oooh.
-
Oh, no. Poor Ravel.
- Oh, poor Maurice.
He's all unravelled.
- Nearly time to get ready.
- Can I swim some more, darling?
- All right. Ten minutes.
Do some Liszt. Not a concerto.
Swim "La Campanella".
That should do it.
- Oh, I've gone wrong, darling.
I've gone wrong.
- Keep trying.
- Keep trying. I'm very trying.
- Page 37's missing.
Oo-ooh, it's the coda. It's the end.
It's the beginning of the end.
- I'll soak my hands.
- David!
Gotcha.
- The first concert in years
and you wear odd shoes.
- I'm a sausage.
You certainly are.
Sit! No, up straight.
-  Sit up straight.
- We'll be in the car.
- Relax.
- Relax. I must learn to relax.
Must learn to relax.
-
-  Perfect.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Bravo!
Bravo!
- My darling.
- They want an encore.
- Do they, darling?
They want some more?
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to win.
- Not now, darling.
- I'll do some more. I'll do some more.
- Do some more.
What do you feel?
The thing is
I feel nothing.
Nothing at all?
Well, I'm shocked, stunned and
completely amazed. How does that sound?
Perhaps it's all my fault.
Perhaps it's me. Perhaps I don't know.
- You can't go on blaming yourself
for everything that's happened.
- You can't go blaming yourself.
That's true. And you can't go blaming
Daddy because he's not here any more.
- But you are.
- I am here. That's true.
- And life goes on, doesn't it?
Is that right?
- Yes.
- It does, forever and ever? Whoa-oh.
- No, not forever.
Never forever. Not quite. The point is
life's not all lamb loins chops, is it?
It goes on, and you just have to
keep going too. You can't give up.
Certainly not. Every time that blooming
Saturn comes along and gives us a jolt.
- Oh, it's the stars, Gillian.
- Everything has its season.
- It's a mystery.
- There's always a reason.
Oh, we just need to seize
the reason for the season.
