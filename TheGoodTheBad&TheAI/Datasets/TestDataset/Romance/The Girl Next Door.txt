- Hugo, hi.
- Look at you.
You look fantastic.
Just starting out

-  No, they don't.
- So how's Kelly treating you?
- Okay.
- Just okay?
Danielle, what do we know? Hmm?
- Uh--
- What do we know?
We know that you should be with me.
At the top where the air is crisp.
- Nice tan.
- Kelly, what do we say?
Fuck you.
Always with the big words.
Danielle, where the air is crisp.
- What does that mean?
- Nothing. He's just being Hugo.
Matty. What are you doing here?
Um, look, Kelly, no offense...
but I really don't think Danielle
wants to be here right now.
Matthew, please just go home, okay?
Hey, "D." "D."
I'm sorry, man. Come on.
Let's get out of here.
What's up?
- It's not cute anymore.
- What?
Stop filling her head with that--
Do not piss me off!.
Hey, I thought we were friends.
Friends don't fuck with
each other's business.
And that's what this is--
my fuckin' business.
What?
What are you gonna do?
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Stay the fuck away from her.

Hey, what about your thing tomorrow?
The scholarship dinner?
Sorry, I gotta do this.

What?
No. No, man. You're fine.

Hell, yeah, we'll use you.
Baby, I'll do things to you

Good luck tonight.
Thanks.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Will you go to prom with me?
What?
I would love to.
Now for the scientific
explanation. Anybody?
That your speech?
Yeah.
You ready for tonight?

- Get up.

Stay in school.
Look, I have the most important dinner
of my life tonight...
so wherever we're going,

Just so you know.
Here he comes.
- It's a cool ride, huh?
- Yeah, if you're a fag.
- Jesus!
- It's cool! It's cool!
Get in.
Where are we going?
I thought you were cool, man.
I tried to be your friend,
and what do you do? You fuck me.
- I didn't fuck you.
- She didn't show up on set
Now I'm out 30 grand.
Guess who's paying me back.
What? I don't have 30 grand.
- Get your folks to help you out.
- They don't have that kind of money.
Look, Kelly, I'm a problem
solver, all right?
This is what I do. Okay?
Let's just-- Let's just think
outside of the box here.
Look, she'll get a job,
I'll keep mowing lawns.
Over time, we'll pay it down.
You know? This can work.
We can do this.
It'll be like a payment plan.
You really care about her, huh?
- Yeah, I really do.
- I don't know.
If I'm gonna do
this payment plan thing...
I need a show of good faith, you know?
- Something concrete.
- Well, like what?
A blow job.
Nah, I told you.
She's not gonna do that anymore.
Who said anything about her?
Yeah. We're definitely
outside the box now, huh?
Now you gotta ask yourself...
how far are you willing to go, hmm?
How much do you really care about her?
I'm joking, man!
Relax.
- Damn! Do I look gay to you?
- No, but, geez--
You wanna be president...
Iet me tell you the first rule of politics:
Always know if the juice
is worth the squeeze.
You know what that means?
It means you don't steal my girl
unless you're ready to accept
All right. I'm sorry, okay?
That's gonna swell up
like a bitch. Here, take these.
I'm telling you,
it's gonna hurt like shit.
I'm sorry I got upset.
I just-- I felt taken advantage of.
Look, I'm not gonna be a dick.
I know she loves you.
I'm gonna leave
you guys alone.
But now you're doing
something for me.
Remember that ass-bag Hugo
from the convention?
We used to be partners
a long time ago.
One day, I had this killer idea...
to make films set in
real-life situations.
You know, real-world porn.
I tell the idea to Hugo.
He says he'll think about it.
And what does that motherfucker do?
Takes my best girls,
starts his own company with my idea...
and the guy makes millions.
It's not the money that pisses me off.
I mean, yeah, fuck...
it does piss me off, but that's not it.
It's the perception.
Everybody thinks Hugo's the genius.
It was my idea. It's like he's Simon
and I'm Garfunkel.
Look at me, man.
I'm fuckin' Garfunkel.
Look, seriously. I can't do this.
Don't be a pussy. Nobody's home.
- Why do you want this thing so bad?
- Because. It should've been mine.
- I'm just gonna grab it and leave.
- You don't understand.
I have to be at a dinner in an hour.
My whole life depends on it.
- You want me out of Danielle's life?
- Yes, I do.
- Then let's go.
- But wait. Seriously--
Sometimes in life,
if you want to do something good,
Yeah, but this is breaking and entering.
This is politics.
Hey, after this, we're cool, okay?
You're all right, man.
@@
Yes. I'd like to report a robbery.
Bang me!
Cradle the balls!

Help me!
Help! Ah, fuck!
Wait! Come on!
Okay, so what time
does the dinner start?
- 6:30.
- Oh, my God!
Don't worry.
We'll get there.Just try and--
Dude, what are you doing?
I don't know. I just--
I feel so good.
Oh, my God.
I-- I just feel so weird.
Shh. Don't worry.
Ecstasy is not that bad.
-  What?
- Kelly likes dosing people with "E."
Oh, my God. Am I gonna die?
No, no. It's okay, Matt.
You're gonna be fine, I promise.
You're such a good friend,
Klitzy. I love you.
I love you so much.
This is gonna be amazing!

- Wait a second.
- Oh, my God.

You don't understand.
It's really kicking in right now.
Just try not to talk so much, okay?
Talk so much?
I'm giving a speech.
- It's okay. Just go with it.
- Wait, wait, wait!
In a few minutes, we'll begin
the speeches, and we hope--
Thank you again for coming

Some serious shit.
But, Jesus, man, it's good to see you!
Will you excuse us, please?
Oh, my God. Am I blowing it?
Just try and control yourself.
Just breathe, okay?
All right.
I've learned a lot from my teachers...
but my best teacher has always been my mother...
a woman who worked three jobs
trying to support me...
ever since I was a little nina.
I will never forget the day she said to me...
"Si trabajas duro, todo es posible."
And that is why I have always
tried to answer the call
who urged us to ask not
what your country--

Let's see here.
I can't speak a foreign language,
so that's out.
And I certainly can't quote
J.F.K.. now, can I, Ryan?
You know, it's funny.
I have this whole speech prepared...
and I 've been practicing
for weeks, but you know what?
I'm just gonna go with it.
"Moral fiber." So what is moral fiber?
I mean, it's funny.
I used to think it was always telling
the truth, doing good deeds...
you know, basically being
a fucking Boy Scout.
-
- But lately I've been seeing it differently.
Now I think that moral fiber
is about finding that one thing
That one special thing
that means more to you than
And when you find her,
you fight for her.
You risk it all.
You put her in front of everything--
your future, your life-- all of it.
And maybe the stuff you do
to help her isn't so clean.
You know what? It doesn't matter.
Because in your heart, you know...
that the juice is worth the squeeze.
That's what moral fiber's all about.
First, I'd just like
to commend the candidates...
on their impressive remarks.
This year was a very tough decision.
And as much as we'd love to give
you all scholarships, we can't.
And so, I am proud to announce...
the winner of this year's
Sheridan Scholarship...
Ryan Winger.
Oh, God, what happened?
Yeah, I slipped.

using a real person.
No cucumbers or bananas in this video.
So for those of you naughty boys...
