O you side hero, what are you
doing? Rishi Kapoor is over there.
What do you do?
Are you the director?
If I were the director,
I would've thrown you out first.
O you hero!
Who?
Me?
Yes, you.
Is this your father's jacket that you've
put it on and trying to sneak out.
Why are you mentioning
my father, dress uncle?
Was your father Raj Kapoor?
That he could stop our shooting.
Chintuji gave me the jacket
so I put it on.
No one can become a hero
by just wearing a jacket.
There must be some looks.
Give me jacket.
You've made a mess
of this jacket.
Look at this dress uncle.
Don't mind him. He's just a drunk
can't see a future superstar.
Superstar!
Will I become a hero?
Why not?
You will surely become a hero.
My mom says that too.
Keshtu Mukherjee's mother
also says the same.
Really?
- Mother's all same.
But you'll become a hero.
Because I, Pappu Master, saying...
that you will become a hero.
You have everything,
style, hairstyle, race, face...
and extreme talent.
But there's just one thing coming
between you and your stardom.
What's that?
Your name.
My name?
- Om Prakash Makhija
your bill is due for two months.
When will you pay?
I will...
in this lifetime or the next?
Your cream roll also is not
from this lifetime.
You've been selling it
since the times of Alam Ara.
You'll see Pappu.
When I'll become a big star...
I'll get his canteen shut.
Remember my name.
Om Prakash Makhija.
Just "Om Prakash" can do the job.
But this "Makhija"...
you can't become star with this.
Really?
- No.
Look, who's coming.
Come here.
What's your name?
Govind Ahuja.
What kind of name this is?
You can't get a job
with this name.
Do one thing. Change your
name with, Rohan Kapoor,
Raj Kiran, something like that.
You'll see producers will
line up for you.
What if I use just "Govinda"?
Lets try.
- Thank you...
you're right Pappu.
My father had no
other name for me.
There're many big stars in the industry.
Rajinder, Jitender, and Dharminder.
And what he chose...
Om Prakash.
Here comes our favorite.
Rajesh Kapoor.
This the name of a hero.
Kapoor...
name has the weight.
Now do one thing. Remove this
"Makhija" from your name and
put Kumar, Kapoor, Khanna
or something.
Then you'll see. How shot of
your luck gets ok in first take.
Ok.
I could change my name today but...
you know...
what will Mom say?
No...
hey Lord,
what I'm hearing.
My lovely son,
my Om,
wants to change his name.
I ask, what's wrong
with this name?
We remember Lord
by saying "Om".
We remove darkness by
saying "Prakash".
And with "Makhija"...
we remove flies by
saying "Makhija".
I can live with "Om" and "Prakash",
but with "Makhija" as my name,
I can never become a hero.
Never...
you will my son.
You'll surely become a hero one day.
That's what my heart says.
A mother's heart says.
To hell with a mother's heart.
I can't become a hero in this
lifetime with this name.
I'll die doing job as a junior artist.
Like father.
O father of Om Prakash!
It's good that you're dead
before hearing all this.
Gods!
How much you're over-acting?
Now I get this, why you
couldn't become a heroine.
What's this?
Me and over-acting?
You know, K. Asif called me.
For screen test.
If you weren't in my womb
at that time.
Mughal-e-Azam's Anarkali wouldn't
have been Madhubala but Bela Makhija.
Your mother.
Madhu also handled it well.
But if I was Anarkali...
then it wouldn't be Mughal-e-Azam
but Flop-e-Azam.
Flop-e-Azam, Mom.
The truth is...
you're a junior artist.
Father was a junior artist too.
And maybe I'll remain a
junior artist as well.
Leave me alone.
Om, stop son.
I've made kheer.
Stupid, he's mad.
What's mummy?
Why are you standing like this?
Look, Pappu, your stupid friend
again fought and left.
He didn't even stop for kheer.
Not even for kheer?
Then he must have gone to
the bridge to see his girlfriend.
Girlfriend?
Shanti are you fine?
All's well?
You know why I always come to you.
Because you're my only strength.
You're my courage, my inspiration,
my dream.
You're my path and
you're my destination.
You...
I hope you're not
getting bored.
You know that.
How good an actor I am.
Mom and Pappu also say
that I'll become a big star.
But I want to become a star
only for you.
That I could stand with you.
And alongside you, I could say...
hey...
aren't you getting bored?
Thanks.
This is the best quality of yours.
That I keep on talking and...
you never get bored.
You keep on smiling.
I know that you're a dream girl
of millions of your fans.
But know one thing.
No one will love you more
then me in this whole world.
And yes.
Instead of Shanti Priya superstar,
If you were Shanti Priya super
junior artist,
I would still be loving you like this.
And you will see.
One day we will meet.
And that day is not far, my friend.
Pappu, mom, when did you come?
Why didn't you say anything?
Didn't feel the need.
Let me see my daughter-in-law.
She's a jewel.
Mom, you are too much.
Please forgive me today.
I spoke nonsense in anger.
No, my son.
You'll become a hero one day.
Your face will be put
on a poster like this.
That's what my heart says.
A mother's heart says...
that ran for 25 weeks.
Silver jubilees.
Shut up.
Mothers' hearts are all same.
Yes.
Here son, it's thread from
Sai Baba of Shirdi.
Baba will definitely fulfill
your desires.
You'll soon meet Shanti.
Really?
- Really.
And this can happen
just tonight.
Tonight?
What's tonight.
He touched me.
- That's great.
How do I look?
- We always look good in rented clothes.
When will you announce the
good news?
Good news is coming next week.
I am sure like the previous year,
I will get the best actor
award this year too.
She's asking about the
other good news.
What other good news?
Oh! Baby?
That will be soon.
Now here comes,
the star of the evening.
The dreamy girl herself.
Shanti Priya.
What are you doing?
He's a super star.
You done great my lion.
You've grabbed her scarf.
Will you keep on standing here?
Don't we have to see the movie?
But who will let us in?
Here's the tickets.
Trick worked today.
But these are...
I know that. I slipped them
while taking autograph.
Let's go.
Mr. Manoj Kumar...
please come.
Hail Mother India.
Ramesh Babu, you can't understand the
value of just a little bit of "Sindoor".
It's god's blessings, just a
little bit of Sindoor.
Pushpaa!
It's the pride of married
woman, a little bit of Sindoor.
It's the dream of every woman.
...a little bit of Sindoor.
O Pushpaa!
Don't do that.
Look ahead dude.
If real Manoj Kumar comes,
we will get a good beating.
No, Mr. Manoj Kumar is a nice
man, he won't say anything.
Madam, believe me,
I am Manoj Kumar.
Security, check him.
Here's my driving license.
You're lying...
Ramesh Babu, you can't understand the
value of just a little bit of "Sindoor".
It's god's blessings, just a
little bit of Sindoor.
Great!
It's the pride of married
woman, a little bit of Sindoor.
Great
It's the dream of every woman.
...a little bit of Sindoor.
Great...
clap for him.
That's wonderful.
This year's Filmfare award
will be given to your sister-in-law.
Yes, but if award jury was here,
they would have given you award.
Really?
- Yes.
Will I get award when
I'll become a star?
Of course.
When I'll become a star
I'll buy this bungalow.
You will.
Right now, it belongs
to that Rajesh Kapoor.
One day it will be mine.
Rajesh Kapoor lives like a poor man.
I will live in style.
Style.
There will be 15-16 imported cars.
- Style.
There will be 50-60 servants.
- Style.
And there will be bedroom with
round bed like Yash Chopra's set.
In style.
When I'll wake up in the morning,
before putting my foot on the
marble floor, one servant...
will put soft slippers in my foot.
Do you know what the
second servant will do?
He'll put the silk gown like
Raj Kumar's on me.
And the third one will
stand on side with juice for me.
What happened?
You've made me cry?
- Why? What happened?
You'll get the Filmfare award
later, but right now
press...
take photos.
I've also wrote a speech
for this award.
Should I say here?
Ladies and Gentlemen.
I have tried that hard
to have you.
That everything has conspired
to get me meet with you.
I couldn't understand anything.
Should I make it simple?
- A bit.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
It's being said, that if you sincerely
want someone to be yours...
all the universe starts turning
things to get you meet with them.
You all have made
me meet with my love.
Thanks.
Thanks very much.
I feel like the King
of the World.
I have believed today that...
like our movies, our lives
also get all right till the end.
Happy endings.
If it's not all right.
It's not "the end".
Film is still unfinished.
I love you,
I love you all.
Shut up.
What nonsense you're speaking?
I love you man.
Get away from here.
Look him, what's he saying?
Hey drunk! Don't you know him?
Who are you?
He's the superstar Om.
You didn't recognize him,
he's Manoj Kumar.
Then I'm Dara Singh.
Have you come son?
Yes.
- It's too late.
I was scared.
Oh my filmi mother!
What's to get scared?
No matter how late.
But I will come home.
To you.
Come on, get fresh,
I'll bring dinner for you.
No, I've had my dinner.
And drink too.
Forgive me today.
I'm sorry.
Like you always say that,
this moon...
who moon?
The moon on the sky.
Like you always say
that this moon isn't a moon,
it's a dream
that you have seen it for me.
Tonight I've touched that dream.
With these very hands.
Really?
Really.
My prince.
Now go to bed, don't you have
to go for shooting in the morning.
Makeup man fixed the mustache too
tight that I can't open my mouth.
How I'm going to say my dialogues?
But good thing is no
one will recognize you.
See that's why I've put
a mole on my face.
It's amazing, you are
absolutely unrecognizable.
Assistant Director.
Should I do everything?
Assistant Director, find out
what's the scene here.
And what are my dialogues.
Scenes is that, there will
be a fire in these fields.
Actions.
Your dialogue is "run".
And then?
Is that it?
"Run".
Just "run".
It's a lame dialogue.
Lame?
I wrote it.
Great, what a dialogue?
I think the hall will be blown.
But there should be some
powerful heroic dialogues.
Heroic dialogues will be
spoken by the hero.
Which is not you. There's
the hero "Vicky Sandhu".
Call the producer.
- That director has gone mad again.
Vicky Sandu...
bastard...
see the problems with the heroine.
Shot's ready and she says she'll
work only after the producer comes.
She's asking me,
the biggest director.
She's telling me she'll work
only after seeing the producer.
Call Mr. Mukesh.
What's going on?
It's the same. Heroine isn't
coming out of the tent.
She might not have been
paid in last shoot.
No, it's Mukesh Mehra's film.
He's a big producer.
Be it big or small producer.
Those stars have been treating
producers like dogs.
What did you say?
- Controls.
Our Shanti is not like that.
Yes, even Mukesh Mehra
gave her first break.
"Bali umar ko salaam"
Shanti was just 16 years
old back then.
Mr. Mukesh has come.
Now see, the shooting
will start in 10 minutes.
Mr. Mukesh is handsome.
What a personality.
He's dashing.
Why doesn't he becomes
a hero, he's tall.
Smarty pants.
We never become bandits for
any producers,
It's just because of
Mr. Mukesh.
You're having too much cough.
Shanti will be ready in 10
minutes, get your shot ready.
Very good problem solved.
It's bad for my creativity.
Don't cry for every little thing.
It's Bombay, it's like this here.
This whole scene should
be done today.
Of course, I've put three
cameras.
One Satyajit Ray angle.
One Bimal Roy angle,
and one Guru Dutt angle.
Put one Manmohan Desai
angle, that will work.
Understood?
You took too long.
By the way what are you
doing after pack-up?
Suicide.
I'm also ready to die.
Sir, you are in the field.
Sirju.
Run
run
run
Sirju, it's your shot.
Jump into the fire.
Fire is too hot, let it
cool down, I will jump.
What the hell is happening?
Someone save me.
Sir, cut the scene,
Sirju is not jumping in the fire.
No, I won't cut until
the shot is cleared.
Producer has asked
me to finish the scene today.
Someone help me.
In the shooting of Mother India,
Sunil Dutt saved Nargis like this.
They both got married later on.
But I'm already married,
what's my gain in this.
Help me.
Shanti is alone there,
please go and save her.
If you care about her then
you go ahead and save her.
Someone say "cut".
Someone jump in the fire.
Doctor can't you reduce your
fee? You came for half shift.
Is it painful?
- Yes.
Look here I'm talking to you.
If something happened to you,
what could I tell your mom?
Look here I'm talking to you.
But Shanti was in fire...
- to hell with Shanti...
there were many to save her.
Who was coming to save you?
Look here I'm talking to you.
Then why are you moving
here and there?
Shut up.
Thank god that you were
burned only on the back.
If your face was burned, then
not only you couldn't
become a superstar,
but you would have to
work in horror films.
I would have.
What could have happened?
I would have burned, died.
I didn't think anything at
that moment.
I just saw a wall of fire
and behind that trapped Shanti.
You know, if required,
I'll jump not just once,
not ten times, not hundred
times but thousand times
in the fires where Shanti is trapped.
In front of Shanti's life,
my dreams are nothing.
Nothing matters.
Now look here.
Look here.
What are you doing like this?
I've met many people.
But none of them did
anything like this.
That you did for me
being just a stranger.
I'm a stranger to you.
But for me you're a part
of myself
without that I'm incomplete.
What's your name?
My name is the one who
always with Shanti.
Om
before Shanti and
after Shanti.
Look, I know you're not mute.
If you won't tell me your name,
how I will thank you.
Om
Shanti
- Om
I think I've seen you before.
Yes, maybe on that premiere
that night.
On posters.
You must have seen
his film's posters.
Madras Raja

Omoswami Shanti Nathan.
Who Omoswami?
You, who else.
He's too down to earth.
Who would believe his
first film was a golden jubilee.
Really?
- Really?
Really.
You'll see, Shanti Ji.
Very soon our Om will dominate
all of the Bombay industry.
Really?
- Really.
Of course.
By the way, you have
earned your first fan today.
Not fan, a friend Shanti Ji.
Not Shanti Ji, just Shanti.
Can I go?
Okay

No sorry, no thank you.

Not yet.

I am sorry for not believing in you.
No, I am sorry for you not

If you can't do this then how
can I see the dreams?
But I have seen to be a biggest
man of this industry.
But now that dream
comes bigger like this.
Will break your trust.
But not this dream.
You are hurting me Mukesh.
No, you are hurting me.
Do you think this.
No, always not.
Why you do all this?
Everything was going perfect.
We have Mithal's money also.
You were going to be the
biggest heroine of India.
And I would be the biggest producer.
No, because its just you.

I can't marry you and nor
I can return Mithal's money.
But here is only one way.
Just because of you

That man which

We can't save him.
Oh, my god.
What happens now, Nasir.
Don't worry, Sir.
It was an accident.
Doctor says that he
was almost dead.
But Nasir, what about his family?
I am your secretary
Sir, I can handle it all.
Today is birthday of Om Kapoor,
son of Rajesh Kapoor.
And his all fans are here to wish him
Happy Birthday.
I would have wonderful bedroom,
like in Yash Chopra's set
with rounded bed,
and when I'll wakeup in the morning,
than before my feet touch to the floor,
one servant will bring velvet sleepers
into my feet
when I'll go outside, wearing
Raj Kumar's silk gown
the other servant will
give me a glass of juice,
superstar Om Kapoor, whose nick is ok,
has come to his balcony,
hi Dad!
Happy Birthday
here comes superstar, Om Kapoor.
He's just four hours late,
Sir, autograph,
he's quite short in his real life,
Dad, it's 4 o'clock,
when will hero arrive?
Looks like I'll have an attack,
ready Sir,
are you director?
Yes Sir,
tell me the scene!
come on tell me the scene!
As you see it's a climax scene Sir,
and in this our actress
Natasha is going to...
marry our villain, Ranbheer
that's so rocks babe,
rocks?
Nokia, bluetooth,
you keep talking and I'll keep talking,
Sir, Raj means your heart is breaking!
He wants to say to actress, but he can't
why?
Am I mute?
Correct Sir,
you remember your mother's death scene!
So there's also a mother
in this scene!
Yes in mother's death scene you shouted
this much,
that your voice is gone forever.
At this point, for the last time,
you want to see Natasha,
but you can't see her,
why? Why?
Because you are blind too,
so I'm a blind too,
I see.
No Sir, you don't
I don't?
Background music begins, and
your walk away from marriage spot starts,
and Natasha turn around and sees you,
Natasha sees me,
but Natasha was blind...
no Sir, blind is you,
no, but I was mute.
Sir, you are mute,
and also blind, and when Natasha says you...
please stop Raj,
but you won't stop,
because you are deaf too.
In background Natasha's marriage,
and in foreground you and your heart voice.
Ok, I'm angry now,
voice, one second...
let me hear dialogues,
Natasha, I want to say, that I want
to take you away from the spot,
but I'm cursed, I can not
stand up from the wheel chair,
and my both hands are cut off.
Wow, my both hands are cut off.
What the hell is this.
In this film, is there any body part of
hero is in working order or not?
Of course, as you see, his painful heart.
Won't pain in heart but will definitely
pain in head, watching to this movie,
this film will get critical acclaim,
and also awards,
but tell you what,
this film is a flop!
This film is gone,
you are dead old man.
You are dead!
Unless,
unless, I think of something as usual!
In this situation, there must be an item
song to express the pain.
There must be something painful Qawali,
but I have done it...
painful rock... no, no...
I think it should be like painful...
disco!
Disco!
But Sir the one have no hand, eyes and ear,
how can he do disco.
Idiot! Dream sequence,
ok can do anything!
come on girls,
and listen, the actress is quite bad!
Is she your girlfriend?
No Sir, she's of him,
papa! You must change her!
Bring up 4 or 5 item girls, besides her,
I'm telling you, your film
will be a hit because of this song.
come on!
Cheer up!
And pack up!
Cut the scene!
Who brought up the fire!
Don't you know he is afraid of fire,
afraid of fire, I didn't know!
Take me home.

I feel something looking at her!
She's is mad,
She thinks that you
are her son!
Dude, I'm a star, and all woman
in India thinks of me as their son
that's good, but this is not!
Make sure it won't happen again!
You could get hurt!
Move it, damn!
Pappu, he left me again,
please stop him.
Why you trouble yourself?
That's not our Om!
He's Om Kapoor!
Only his face resembles to our Om!
No Pappu, he's my Om.
My son Om!
Hello, this is my son Om!

Ladies and Gentlemen!
This is for my dear friend
and my favorite actor,
Om Kapoor!
Ok!
We love you!
Om, meet my friend Mukesh Mehra!
Top producer of our time,
he's been in Hollywood
for last 25 years
he just came back, and he want to make
a big film with you!
Its' great Mukesh!
Call me Mike!
Everyone in Hollywood does!
Om shake hand come on!
Its' fantastic!
Fantastic!
come on let's celebrate!
Om!
You arrived!
Yes, Mom!
You've taken much time!
I was afraid!
Very filmy!
What's to worry about
that's doesn't matter how long
it takes,
I must come home!
Alright!
Than why you left me alone!
Please just forgive me today!
I couldn't recognize you!
But you recognized me,
really, only mom can have such heart!
My son, my hero!
My Omii!
Omi!
You've become old,
yeah
you still the same,
and also became a star!
I remember you said, the put Kapoor
after your name!
You seen Pappu!
I told you, that my son
will become star one day!
Tell me you won't leave me again!
No, I won't leave you!
I won't go anywhere,
and this time, everything
will going to be fine,
really!
Really!
No one agrees to this story!
Sometimes, truth is different from stories!
We can't prove anything to anyone!
That scoundrel will be saved once again,
we didn't find Shanti's corpse there Om!
We couldn't find about you too!
If you want anything with all your heart,
the whole world begins effort
to make you meet to that,
that's what we used to say!
That Mukesh Mehra is thinking that...
he is totally saved,
there's no witness, nor evidence, but...
that's the game of nature,
that god brought him
once again to me,
my visit to that studio,
my recognition of myself,
my meeting with Mom,
meeting to you, it's not a coincidence,
it's not coincidence,
no... no!
Someone else is writing this story!
And this time, ending of this story,
is in our hands,
I can not forget, Shanti's screams,
I couldn't save her at that time,
because I was bound,
I was nothing,
but this time the tables have turned!
And Mukesh Mehra must be punished!
This time, it'll be justice with Shanti!
She'll have justice,
and this time, everything will be fine,
because, the picture is still remaining!
Still remaining, my friend!
You want to remake the film
"Om Shanti Om"
that's ridiculous,
I'm serious Mukesh!
You know Mukesh,
I have been offered four to
five scripts daily, I reject them all,
but Om Shanti Om, that's cool,
it has emotion, drama, action, romance,
I'm sure it's going to be a
block buster Mukesh!
Rebirth, who believe
in this shit nowadays?
That doesn't matter,
if anyone believes or not,
you just have to believe
as a maker,
you have to in the script Mukesh!
Call me Mike,
everyone in Hollywood does,
Mukesh became Mike,
that's funny, Mike!
And that film's
climax was not written, Om!
That project was a bloody jinx!
Bloody curse!
What curse!
Cursing was just for
that insurance company
who has given you four times
value of studio when it got burned!
And you got married to...
Harsh Mithal's daughter,
you went to Hollywood,
millions of dollars you have,
you haven't taken one shot,
and Om Shanti Om became
the biggest movie of your career,
where is the bloody curse Mike?
You know much about me, Om!
No!
Call me O.K.!
Everyone in Bollywood does,
got you! Yeah!
And I also know that,
there was an incident at your set,
to your actress, what's her name?
Sha...
Shanti!
Shanti what?
Shanti Priya
Shanti Priya!
What happened?
What become of Shanti Priya!
She...
she disappeared!
I tried much to find her,
but gone!
Gone
they say, you can
find God if you search
It looks like you didn't
intent to find her, Mike!
It's a joke, chill dude!
Hey, get away!
Are you ok?
I'm not ok!
No, I'm not ok!
I'm scared of fire!
Really!
I'm scared of fire, Mike!
Seriously speaking, if you want
to do any work with me,
It must be Om Shanti Om, otherwise
I'm not interested Mike!
You know, you are very stubborn!
I know that!
I like that!
I'm going to America for a month,
as I come back and you...
and you'll find your actress,
we'll shoot!
You got it!
You got it! Mike!
And...
don't worry about
the climax, Mikey!
I'll write this story's climax myself,
this time!
Cheers! To a new beginning!
No, no... to a new end!
Mike!

years later.
Ok Omi, this was last batch.
Yeah, but none was like Shanti
we will find one definitely.
We don't have enough time Pappu.
Mukesh Mehra will return in few days,
when, how she will be found?
Excuse me.
Is Om Kapoor there?
No, he is not here.
Its pack up, come tomorrow for audition
tomorrow?
But watchman said he is in.
I have come from Bangalore for this,
please give me one chance.
I am big fan of O.K.
Audition is just an excuse to meet him.
I just!
Pappu please turn on the lights.
Papa... hero is here!

Suhagan's crown... one "chutki sindur"
Suhagan's crown... one "chutki sindur"
why you are laughing? Is this joke,
Pappu she can't be our Shanti.
She is not like Shanti.
But you can try,
everyone is trying here.
You made her cry!
Om. We all are trying, but she doesn't
even know what this is, and our plan.
What plan? This is only going to happen
if Mukesh takes her as Shanti.
She only looks like Shanti, Mukesh
will find out about her then. And the plan fail.
Om. Then we must tell her everything,
what is this and why this so important.
Before acting, she has to understand
Shanti,
Om Shanti Om is my life story,
and I should have told you earlier.
Because you can't be Shanti if you
don't feel the pain of Om.
But if I would tell it,
no one would believe in this story.
Not even you.
Me? You jump from the 50th floor and
stand and I believe you.
You save a heroine from 100 villains,
I believe you.
You fly, walk on water, I believe everything,
then why you think I won't believe this story?
There is still time,
this time I will truly try.
Mommy?
I am glad, fool.
In such a short time you got
sad script and heroine.
My people have already arranged
the opening ceremony
this ceremony, prays... is this
all necessary?
I don't believe in this too, that's why
we have arrange something different
from all the places you find this
place?
You know... yeah, this is the place where
fire burned the whole set.
I know everything,
that's why I have chosen this place.
Start unfinished story from the same
place where it left
Sir, why you started Om Shanti Om,
if we won't start then how it will finish?
And that's the director of this film.
You should have ask me once.
There are many things ahead which
you were never asked.
You can call him Mukesh Mehra.
Heroine of this movie, what's her name?
Dolly.
You will like her she is very
sexy.
No... no... she is Dolly's mom.
What's her name?
Kamani Jee.
Baby was so excited even not sleeping, I
mention her dark circles then she dozed off.
I never compromise with my
beauty sleep.
Yeah, I can see that.
Baby?
Baby, respectfully greet him.
Pappu, we are coming at the set
is Mom ready?
Yeah Mommy is ready, but she is
over acting...
that's our family problem.
Hey Mommy, let's move.
What move, you don't understand,
let me come in my character.
Move, move everything is ready there.
Forget my line.
Don't go inside.
I need ponytail like Mike
in my next movie.
What happened, Mikey?
Why you put set here?
I told you about that circle of life...
I know...
Don't go inside...
Don't go inside...
She is waiting for you.
She won't spare you.
Who?
Who won't spare him?
Shanti...
Don't cry baby, you care about your
eye liner, she is a mad mommy.
Is any one inside?
Nice set, Mikey?
He is villain of our movie like you.
Coconut breaking time.
Take it for Shanti,
Om Shanti, Shanti Om.
It will break in first try, or its not
a good sign.
It didn't break... no problem,
try again.
Bad luck let me do it.
No... I will do it.
No problem Mikey, who breaks coconut
in Hollywood.
But here we break coconut before
every kind of work.
At this time tribute to the actress
whom this film was written.
I believe where ever she is,
she is looking at us.
Now, I request Dolly to light the
dia, and take blessings from her.
Come on Dolly, I will move there.
By pressing this button there will
be spark at the photo.
If that won't happen...
I will give you slap.
Its not working, what happened.
I think that's wire's problem.
Someone help with fire.
Don't go inside...
wow Mommy, nice acting,
here's iron coconut for you.
Here's fake eyebrow for me.
It was fun, right?
No... big fun is tomorrow.
You know the plan?
What if I made mistake,
no... no... you won't. Don't be nervous
Lets discuss the plan once again.
Everyone will be there at the
shooting tomorrow.
Baby don't SMS, practice for the
dialogues
Mukesh Mehra too.
Madam your short is ready,
let me refresh my makeup.
Not yours, Dolly, madam's.
I will SMS to Mukesh from Dolly's phone.
I will write "come to makeup room alone."
And I know him, he will go there.
Pappu he is coming, go take
Sandy to the room.
Where is Dolly's mom. Kamani Jee?
She went for the touchup.
Where?
You know...
where is she...
where is Auntie?
Kamani Jee.
Kamani Jee,
o.k. You.
Why he is following me?
You left this makeup compact, I have
come to return it.
Why you, you should send it
by any spot boy.
Kamani Jee, one minute come here.
What are you doing?
Compact was an excuse actually I wanted
to meet you in person.
Why?
Because I always like older women.
When I saw you first time, I have
known we will have something
but I never expected that sudden,
you should work for Hollywood.
I can take you there.
Mikey! Someone inside.
There is someone inside too...
Mikey, you look like you have
seen ghost.
I told baby do not remove the makeup.
What are you doing Kamani Jee,
Mikey come on nobody is here.
You saw somebody go out
or came inside,
By the way Mikey, what you were
doing in Dolly's room?
Yeah... what you were doing?
I was looking for bathroom,
I was lost.
Next time go to my green room for
bathroom, respect women.
What you say Kamani Jee?
And love too...
how you feeling, I mean you are not
coming at shoot, everybody miss you.
Producers have other work too, and
you are there to take care of shooting.
Yes, of course, I am there.
Shall we begin the scenes?
Projectionist put reel number 9.
You will be surprised.
I didn't know Ramesh, you love me that
much, and want to marry me, here?
Forgive me Ramesh, I didn't trust you.
You are going to land from there
in wedding dress like a fairy.
Have you seen her?
Who Dolly? No, the other girl.
Blessings of god one "chutki sindur"
Suhagan's crown... one "chutki sindur"
don't drink Mikey,
I think you are drunk.
Every women's dream one "chutki sindur"
turn off the projector, turn on the lights
no one is on the screen, it's Dolly.
Put this reel on once again.
Watch now, there is no one.
Blessings of god one "chutki sindur"
Suhagan's crown... one "chutki sindur"
every women's dream one "chutki sindur"
see everything is fine.
How this could happen?
What could happen?
I swear O.K. She was here. I
saw her.
Here, there, where is that girl you
are watching every where.
At sets, at make room and here too!
You know everyone is saying
you are insane.
If the press finds about this...
so what am I, mad. I am handling
everything alone. You don't even care.
And this madness, don't know what
happened to you.
I don't understand what's going on,
I think I should go back to America.
I will go back on tomorrow night's flight.
No. Mikey, you can not go back,
I mean in two days we are launching music.
You have to stay for that.
No. O.K. I can't stay, I must go back.
And you can handle music launch.
What's a big deal.
In the show press, media and
everyone will be there.
If producer won't there, how it will look.
And I am not your servant, I can not
handle everything for you.
One more thing, I can do 10 more
movies.
And the money you got from market
for Om Shanti Om, if it's stopped again,
you will be on the road, Mikey.
You won't do it.
I can do this, and I will do it.
If you want this thing done, come to
the music launch.
You gone mad Om, how we can
prepare everything in two days only.
This plan was after 3 weeks.
You were there Pappu, I had no choice,
he was going back to America.
I though music release would
stop him.
But how we are going to finish this
plan in two days?
There are a lot more work to do
at set, artist
even Sandy is also not ready.
I will try Om. But if made mistake
then?
No mistake, Sandy.
We have to make Mukesh believe
that Shanti has really come back.
You have to scare him till he
speaks the truth.
Truth! I have doubt on your plans.
Scare him like karz movie. Forget it Om
he will run tonight
if you really need something,
the whole world would come to help you
he will definitely come,
don't worry.
Go. Pappu prepare everything,
I know he will come.
Because the movie still not end.
Guests will come on flowers sheets
from here.
There will be 40/30 orchestra playing
only Shanti's songs
there will be a fountain falling champaign
rather than water.
And there will be wedding stage right
below this huge lamp.
Who are you and how you know
all this?
Yeah, you have discuss all this
with Shanti in person.
Yeah, but there was someone else too,
who saw your sin, too.
That was me, Mukesh.
No, how this could happen?
That's impossible but that's true.
I died with Shanti too,
I was junior artist in your big movies,
I couldn't save my Shanti.
But I will fight for her justice
you will be punished, Mukesh
Sandy, its your queue, you know what
you have to do?
Yeah, but I am afraid.
Its not time to be scared, its time to scare
him. Everything is up to you now.
So you going to hang me, by telling your
reincarnation story
ok let me confess myself, coz. Who is
going to ask me you or duplicate Shanti?
What were you thinking, you will plan
this whole thing and I will speak the truth?
You know ghost doesn't get hurt,
there blood don't fall out.
He knows everything, stop Shanti.
Pappu, door is jammed.
Court ask for evidence, and you don't
have it.
Because if I killed Shanti where is
her body?
Yet nobody find her body.
And without evidence, even God
can't harm me.
I will give the evidence, Mukesh.
Yeah, I was waiting for you, you don't
have to do stupid acting anymore.
Stop this rubbish or I...!
Or what you will kill me?
"Sandy, he knows everything"
how many times you will kill me?
"Sandy, he knows everything go away"
shut up both of you, I don't want to
listen your bullshit.
You have to listen Mukesh,
listen carefully,
when fire extinguished you came
back again Mukesh
yeah... so?
To bury my body.
This is nonsense.
I was alive Mukesh, I was breathing.
How you know all this?
And you bury me alive.
How you know all this?
Here under this lamp,
who are you?
Stop Sandy!
Court need evidence?
Evidence will be found.
Nothing will find here,
nothing is here.
Shanti's body will be found
under this lamp.
Shut up, nothing is under this lamp.
Which you buried that night.
Nothing is here...
No. Om you don't kill him.
No. His is going to die by my hand,
he will die but not with your hand.
Om... Omi...
Om...
and you bury me alive.
Shanti's body will be found
under this lamp.
Om... I am sorry...
movie still remain my friend!
