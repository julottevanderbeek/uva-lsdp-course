It was a nice
retirement party.
I guess.
Still, it's a shame
Professor Rothman was forced
to step down.
What choice did
the university have?
He snapped.
It happens to theoretical
physicists all the time.
I wonder how long
Sheldon's got.
These shrimp are
all the same size.
There's no the logical order
to eat them in.
Can't be very long.
Hey, look, there's Rothman's
empty office.
- Sad.
- Mm, indeed.
Yeah.
So sad.
Dibs.
What's up, fellas?
What are you doing
here, Kripke?
Ah, measuring my new office
for drapes.
This is not your office.
It hasn't been assigned yet.
Well, I called dibs
at the Christmas party
when Professor Rothman tried
to have intercourse
with the Toys for Tots
collection box.
Dibs?!
This is a university,
not a playground.
Offices are not assigned
because someone called dibs.
You just called dibs.
Shut it.
Offices are assigned
by seniority.
I arrived
at the university first.
I arrived at the office first.
I'm the proverbial early bird.
Gentlemen.
ALL:
Professor Rothman.
Good evening.
I'm glad
that men are wearing hats again.
They're so distinguished.
Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state
Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait!
The Earth began to cool
The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools
We built the Wall
Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery
That all started
with a big bang

I got you a little something.
A little something?
Oh, it...
Oh, this is huge.
What's huge is
what you've done for me.
Oh, no, Amy,
I haven't done anything.
No, no, before I met you,
I was a mousy wallflower.
But look at me now.
I'm like some kind of downtown
hipster party girl.
With a posse, a boyfriend
and a new lace bra that hooks
in the front, of all things.
Open it.
Open it.
Okay.
I wanted to get you something
you didn't have.
Wow!
I... I don't know what to...
Wow.
Do you like it?
Do I like it? Wow.
So, uh, where are you
gonna hang it?
Oh, my God.
Hang it. Wow.
Um, you know,
I'd have to go get a hook
and nails and a hammer and...
No problem.
Oh, look.
You got...
You just... you got it all
right there. Wow.
I found him.
He's in the bathroom.
President Siebert?
Can't this wait?
I'm sorry.
We just need a word.
Now? You realize I'm your boss,
and I am holding my penis?
Sheldon, give the
man some privacy.
I'm sorry. This guy's got
no respect for boundaries.
What do you want?
Will you tell
this lunatic
that Professor Rothman's
office is rightfully mine?
Can't you take this up
with your department chairman?
We tried. His assistant said
he was on sabbatical.
Although we distinctly heard
his office window open and shut.
Gentlemen, there's a task I'm
trying to accomplish here,
and I'm having
trouble doing it.
Oh, my. President Siebert,
I don't mean to be an alarmist,
but difficulty initiating a
urine stream could be a symptom
of benign prostatic hyperplasia.
If you're interested,
I can send you a link
to a YouTube video
that'll show you how
to perform your own rectal exam.
Uh, helpful hint--
trim your nails first.
Ignore him,
President Siebert.
I'm sure a young man such as
yourself has a perfectly...
healthy prostate.
Oh, he's just trying
to butter you up.
And for the record,
butter is an excellent lubricant
for your rectal exam.
Gentlemen, I'm going to allow
the two of you to work this out
you're both
brilliant scientists,
as far
as who gets
Rothman's office,
I couldn't give the furry crack
of a rat's behind.
Well, as long
as we're here,
I might as well
take a leak.
Kripke?
Yes?
You're in my spot.
That is big.
big.
And ugly.
So ugly.
What am I gonna do?
I don't know.
You can't take it down.
You'll break her heart.
Look at that face.
That enormous, unsettling,
crazy face.
Is there any chance
I'll learn to love it?
That depends.
Do you like pictures of yourself
where you look like a man?
All right, it's got to go.
What will you tell Amy?
How about I tell her
the painting makes
you feel jealous
because you're
not in it?
Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one?
I already have a picture
of me and Howard's mom
getting our hair cornrowed
in Venice Beach.
I've suffered enough.
Well, I guess I could
take it down and put it up
when she comes over,
but it's kind of heavy.
Oh, too bad you're not as strong
as the dude in the painting.
Would you look
at this?
I paid $25
to some kid on eBay
for a handcrafted
Harry Potter wand.
He sent me a stick.
He went into his backyard,
he picked up a stick.
It's numbered.
Ooh, limited edition.
Nice.
Oh, that'll be Kripke.
LEONARD:
What's he doing here?
We're going to work this office
situation out like gentlemen.
And if that doesn't work,
I'm going to poison his tea.
Cooper.
Kripke. Come in.
I'm making tea.
Would you like a cup?
Am I wearing a
summer frock?
No, I don't want tea.
Let's get down
to brass tacks.
Fine. In the interest
of preserving our friendship...
We're not friends.
Well, that's a little hard
to hear, but all right.
As you know, the essence
of diplomacy is compromise.
With that in mind,
I propose the following.
I will take Rothman's office,
and you will find a way
to be okay with that.
How about
I take Rothman's office,
and you go suck a lemon?
You sure I can't get you
that cup of tea?
How about
you decide this
with Rock-Paper-Scissors
Lizard-Spock?
What the frig is that?
Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock
was created
by Internet pioneer Sam Kass
as an improvement
on the classic game
Rock-Paper-Scissors.
All hail Sam Kass.
ALL:
Hail.
How does it work?
Oh, it's very simple.
Scissors cuts paper,
paper covers rock,
rock crushes lizard,
lizard poisons Spock,
Spock smashes scissors,
scissors decapitates lizard,
lizard eats paper,
paper disproves Spock,
Spock vaporizes rock,
and as it always has,
rock crushes scissors.
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?
Well, of course.
Scissors cuts paper, paper
covers rock, rock
crushes lizard,
lizard poisons Spock,
Spock smashes scissors,
scissors
decapitates lizard,
lizard eats paper, paper
disproves Spock,
Spock vaporizes rock,
and as it always has,
rock crushes scissors.
Almost got it.
One more time.
Surely. Scissors cuts paper,
paper covers rock, rock...
Sheldon, stop.
He's screwing with you.
Is he?
Well, then,
it seems
we have reached an impasse.
I see no other option than
to challenge you to a duel.
I'd smack you with a glove,
but just last week,
I packed away my winter things.
It's the 21st century.
You can't
have a duel.
H-Hang on, Howard.
Barry, how good
of a shot are you?
Not pistols. Minds.
A trivia contest,
and you may choose
the field of battle.
trivia,
trivia,
trivia,
or model trains.
You have a complete
advantage in trivia.
You have an eidetic memory.
Plus, I haven't watched
since I discovered
the strip club near my apartment
has a free buffet.
LEONARD:
It's gonna be hard
to find something
you're both equally good at.
Is there anything
you're both equally bad at?
BOTH: Sports.
All right,
this is one-on-one.
First person to five
wins the office. Any questions?
Yes, Sheldon.
Five what?
Balls in the basket.
Ew!
It's out, right?
Time.
Ran out of room.
You know all those
terrible things
bullies used
to do to us?
Yeah.
I get it.
Ooh, aah!
Hey!
He did that on purpose!
No, he didn't.
Nothing that's happening here
is being done on purpose.
Okay, uh, forget one-on-one.
Let's try
a free throw contest.
First person who makes a basket
wins the office.
Making it too easy there,
Hofstadter.
No. No, I'm not.
Use the force, Sheldon.
Use the force.
I'm gonna need more force.
All right, Cooper, prepare
to have your heart broken.
Do I get points for that?
Oh!
All right,
we gave it 45 minutes.
It's no longer funny.
Let's try something else.
What do you propose?
Uh, on the count of three,
both of you bounce the balls
as hard as you can.
The highest bounce
wins the office.
Oh, you are going down, Cooper.
I don't think so, Kripke.
I've bounced many a rubber ball
in my day.
All right,
that's enough trash talk.
LEONARD:
One,
two, three.
Sheldon
was higher.
Congratulations,
Sheldon. You win office.
Who's unsatisfactory
in P.E. now?
We go together
Like rama lama lama
ka dinga da dinga dong
Remembered forever...
Oh, what a great movie.
I cannot believe
you've never seen
My mother didn't allow me
to watch it.
She was afraid it might
encourage me to join a gang.
I've got to go.
I've got to get up early.
My company's testing
a new steroid
that supposedly
doesn't shrink testicles,
and the last one there
has to do e measuring.
I guess I should get going, too.
Good night, painting Penny.
Good night, real Penny.
Good night, real Amy.
You don't have to say
good night to painting Amy,
'cause she's never leaving.
Good night, real Penny.
Bye.
Good night, transvestite Penny.
Okay. Let us take you
off the wall.
Out of sight, out of mind.
I wish.
You know, can I
borrow that movie?
Those singing hooligans
really got my motor running.
Sure, sure. Enjoy.
I mean, get it back
to me when you can, or...
you know what, actually,
you keep it.
It's just going to be
my gift to you.
- Bye.
- Thank you.
Wait...
Where'd the painting go?
It's right over there.
Why?
I have no idea.
That is weird.
- You hate it.
- No.
No, no.
It's just, it's a little big.
- I feel like an idiot.
- No, come on, you're not an idiot.
Look, just help me
put it back up.
Why? So you can just
take it down when I leave?
I don't need your pity.
Oh, Amy, come on...
: I'm just glad I didn't
go for the sculpture.
Ah, the spoils.
I see why victors love them.
I'm happy for you, Sheldon.
But I have to admit I'm going to
miss sharing an office with you.
Oh, of course you are.
Feel free to drop
by any time.
Thank you.
Yeah. Call first.
Oh. Hello.
Professor Rothman.
This isn't your
office anymore.
You're retired.
I think the word you're
looking for is... "invisible."
I came to say I'm sorry.
Don't bother.
Oh, Amy, please.
I'm so humiliated.
I sat there the whole time
that we were watching "Grease,"
thinking you liked the painting.
I know.
I was a fool from "Summer
Lovin'" to the very last
"rama lama lama ke ding
a de dinga a dong."
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
I should have
been honest with you
and told you
the gift was too much.
Yes, too much.
Because our friendship
is fundamentally asymmetrical.
I clearly like you
more than you like me.
I don't think you can
put a number on
how much one person
likes another.
I bought you a painting
that's 12 square feet in area.
There's a number.
Amy, come on...
If you don't like feet,
you can try dollars.
The painting set me back
three grand.
Three gr... Oh, my God!
Look, look, Amy,
all you need to know is,
you are my friend
and I don't want to
lose you out of my life.
I'm sorry, I'm just having
trouble believing you right now.
Grab your hammer.
No. Damage is done.
Okay, look, I didn't want to say
this, but the real reason
I took the painting down was...
because it made
Bernadette very jealous.
Oh, my goodness,
how could I have not seen that?
The painting is
a constant reminder
that of the three of us,
she is the least cool.
Yeah, that's...
that's what it is, so...
You have such a good heart.
Yeah... I try.
Come on.
Whoa, whoa, where are we going?
We're going to go put
this painting back up
in your apartment.
Well, what about Bernadette?
Oh, screw her. She's just lucky
we let her hang out with us.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to raise
the temperature in here
before my nipples tear
through my shirt.
Why don't you just
turn up the thermostat?
Aha! Good question.
It turns out the thermostat
for my new office
isn't in my new office.
No. It's next door,
in Professor Davenport's office,
who is currently
enjoying the hot flashes
associated with menopause.
Why is there a hole here?
Why is there a hole
in my new office?
I've narrowed it down
to two possibilities:
"There was something in the wall
that someone outside
the wall wanted,"
or the more disturbing,
"there was something
in the wall that wanted out."
Well, at least you
finally got a window that opens.
That's nice.
Is it? Listen.
What, you don't like
wind chimes?
No, I hate them,
but it gets worse.
- There it is.
- The bird?
It's completely out of tune
with the wind chimes.
So?
You don't get it, do you?
That's a mockingbird.
Mockingbirds can
change their song,
which means he's
out of tune on purpose.
He's mocking me.
Oh dear. There it is again.
Do you feel it?
The growing realization that
you are one wacky bastard? Yep.
No. The vibration.
We are directly underneath
the geology lab,
and they're running their
confounded sieve shakers again.
Hey, gravel monkeys,
if you need to shake rocks,
try jiggling your heads around!
Sheldon, relax.
How can I relax?
My nervous system is
being stretched out
like the strings of a harp
and plucked by holes and birds
and wind and the
low-hanging scrotum
of the difficult-to-evict
Professor Rothman.
If you're not happy,
why don't you just let
Kripke have the office?
Wait, and let him win?
Do I look crazy to you?
We're trying to think down here,
you geode-loving
feldspar jockeys!
And you...
the notes are
C, D, E, G and A.
You pick one or I am
chopping down that tree!
How's that?
Little higher on the right.
- Now?
- Little more.
No. That's got it.
Yeah, okay.
That's, uh, that's good.
I'll let you in
on a little secret.
Mm.
Originally
we were painted nude.
But I had him add clothes,
'cause I thought
it was an unnecessary challenge
to our heterosexuality.
Yeah, good call.
But if you ever change
your mind, all it would take
is some warm, soapy water
and a couple of sponges.
You're talking about
the painting, right?
Sure.
SHELDON:
Help! Somebody help!
What happened?
I was trying to see what was
in here and my head got stuck.
Why would you do that?
It's called
scientific curiosity!
Now go get butter.
Hang in there.
I'll be right back.
