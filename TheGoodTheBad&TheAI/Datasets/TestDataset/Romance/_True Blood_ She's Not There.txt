Bill's been kidnapped.
Your Majesty, you've had
me abducted by werewolves?
These are not
ordinary werewolves.
Eric Northman sent me!
I'm here to look after you.
You brought this skank
just to make me jealous.
You're gonna make me a cop, and
you're gonna make me one, now.
I've been taking care of your mother.
I think you're the first visitor she's had.
Where's Sookie now?
Jackson, Mississippi.
Let me go!
It's really you.
What about no one telling me my
whole damn life I had a brother?
Those things you can't explain,
I don't care about 'em.
This baby's Rene's!
It's gonna be evil!
SAM:
Take it to him, Tommy!
SAM:
Will you be my
vampire bride?
I won't let you go!
Ahhh!
Get out!
Bill, is it true that Sookie's blood
lets you walk in the sunlight?
The blood works for
a few minutes.
So you turn into a panther.
That ain't so bad.
What are you?
A witch.
Russell took my family.
Now I take his.
No!
Where am I supposed to go?
Not my problem.
You ain't gonna
shoot shit.
Did we find the bag of V?
Kenya put it into evidence.
Mine is the true
face of vampires!
We will eat you.
No!
I'm a faerie?
Your grandfather used to know things.
Personal things he never
would have told anybody.
ERIC: be their only
chance
You traitor.
Say goodbye to my woman.
Somebody gotta take care
of everybody that's left.
I drink human blood.
Drink me.
What, are you gonna
shoot me now?
I wish I could just be
a completely new person.
You will regret this.
Ahhh!
ERIC:
You manipulated me into
falling in love with you!
No!
I have nothing left to lose.
Sookie, come with us.

MAN: Would you like to try
a lumiere? They're great!
Would you like
a lumiere?
Oh!
I feel nauseous.
CLAUDINE: It'll pass.
Well done.
As you were.
Wait. Are you like, the head
of the faeries or somethin'?
Oh, hardly.
No, I'm your...
I'm your godmother.
You know, it's a...
I have a Faerie Godmother?
Oh, it's not all fun and parties.
Some of us have to work.
Okay, if your job is to look after
me, can I just say you suck?
Do you know how many times I could
have used a Faerie Godmother?
Well, you're still
alive, aren't you?
You're not exactly
Miss Trouble-Free, you know.
Come on. Let's
enjoy the party.
Sookie?
Barry?
Yeah.
The bellboy?
Yeah.
How long have
you been here?
We just got here. Jesus,
can you believe this place?
Oh, this is my Faerie
Godmother, Lloyd.
Hi.
Look at everyone.
Do you realize this is like the one place
in the universe where we're not freaks?
Well, we're going
to get a drink.
Once you two are
finished chatting, mingle.
Would you like a lumiere?
A light-fruit.
Yeah.
WOMAN 1: Oh, my God!
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Barry, hold on a sec.
Mmm. Whoa.
This is like biting into pure happiness.
You gotta try this, Sookie.
Yeah, hold on.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Now, isn't that a beauty?
Just turned ripe.
Mmm.
Granddaddy?
Beg your pardon?
Granddaddy Earl.
I'm Sookie.
I just saw you last week.
It was your birthday.
Granddaddy that was
twenty years ago.
think you are
but before
done to
me but I know
Oh, my Lord. It's...
Your grandma, did she...
Did she pass gentle?
It was peaceful. She
lived a happy life.
Mama and Daddy, they were in
a flood, so I have no idea.
I try not to think about it.
It's just me and Jason now.
Twenty years! I can't
understand how...
I swear, I've only been
here a few hours.
You've been here
all this time?
I...
I must have lost
track of time.
It's just, everything
seems so...
lovely.
SERVANT: Would you
like a lumiere?
SOOKIE:
WOMAN: A trap?
The trap is the world
you've left behind.
Oh, no need to bow.
We're all friends here.
I'm sorry. I just have
no idea who you are.
You can call me Mab. I am
the one who sent for you.
Have you had a try of
the lumiere fruit yet?
No, I haven't had a chance.
It's really very good.
I'm not hungry.
Have a taste.
I don't want any
The future of our
kind is in peril.
A vampire breached our realm because
he'd had a taste of faerie blood.
Your blood.
In the old kingdom, vampires
nearly drank us to extinction.
They drove us
onto this plane.
Well, it won't happen again.
I'm staying away from vampires.
I can guaran-damn-tee
you that!
Oh, I know.
We can't have bearers of the fae
on the human plane any longer.
We've sown too many seeds with humans.
Now it is time to harvest!
Harvest?
You're harvesting people.
Fruit, please.
Get away from me!
Eat it.
Granddaddy, run!
Do not let the girl escape!
Get her!
SOOKIE: Can you keep up?
EARL: Trying!
SOOKIE: Try harder!
CLAUDE: Come with us!
We can help you!
Let me go!
Do not fear. We can
get you home.
Hold them off!
I've got the humans!
Hurry. This way! Hurry!
CLAUDE: This way!
Whoa.
CLAUDE: You
have to jump!
What? No. I don't even know
who the hell you are!
My sister was the one
who abducted you
because the Crown wishes to seal off
the human world from Faerie forever.
And you don't?
It was once our world, too. It
is our right to travel there.
Have you eaten
the light-fruit?
He has, but not me.
Only you can go then.
Hurry!
Humans! Do not listen to his
lies. Jump and you will die!
She's closing the portal! Do
you want to go home or not?
EARL: Sook, no! Sookie!
Granddaddy?
What's wrong?
It's, uh... I had
the light-fruit.
But I had to see you home.
Your... Your mama and daddy,
your granny,
are they here?
Yes. Come on.
I never meant to
leave you all.
We never believed
you abandoned us.
None of us ever
stopped loving you.
That's good.
Your gran's gonna give me what
for in heaven, I guarantee ya.
I'm dyin', Pumpkin.
Granddaddy, no.
I can feel it.
Give this to Jason.
Man ought to own
a good watch.
Now I'm happy. I'm
where I belong.
You be good,
Sookie. I love you.
MAN: Just use the one you
got up there right now.
SOOKIE: What the...
Sweetheart, where do you
think you're goin'?
It's my house.
Hey, you can't go in there!
SOOKIE: Oh my God.
SOOKIE: Um, excuse me?
Honey, if you don't come back
out, I'm callin' the police.
Do it! Call the cops, 'cause I
would love an explanation!
JASON: Hello!
Police!
Jason?
Sook, Sookie.
Oh my God. Oh my God!
Look, I can't
believe it's you.
Jason, why are you
dressed like a cop?
Jesus Christ, we thought you were dead!
We've been lookin' everywhere for you.
We, we figured a vampire
must have did it.
Bill or, or maybe
that crazy tall one.
Hold on, hold on.
Stop a second.
What is today's date?
Today is uh, October
twenty-first.
I've been gone two weeks?
Uh, Sook...
You've been gone twelve
and a half months.
SOOKIE: You sold my house?
Your stuff's all still here.
Now, I packed it, but I
didn't get a chance to...
Yeah, I saw.
Well, at least I
didn't throw it away.
Look, Sook, you have
been gone for a year,
and it killed me even thinkin' about all the
people who should still be livin' here,
and how they're all gone.
I just couldn't take
it no more.
Who bought the place?
Uh, a real estate company with
a bunch of initials.
AIK, I think.
Look, they had the cash, they was offerin'
more than I was askin', and I just...
just wanted to be
done with it.
I can't believe you
gave up on me.
What choice did I have?
Sook, you ain't the type to just
skip off without tellin' no one.
Plus, you'd been all mixed up with vampires.
Look, we put up fliers,
we called TV stations,
I did everything I
could think of.
We even made up a website!
But after you
were gone so long...
I swear it felt like ten,
fifteen minutes at the most!
The place where I went,
time just works differently.
I believe you.
I do, but Sook, if you start tellin'
people that you time-traveled
to a land full of faeries,
they're gonna put you away.
Where the hell did
you get that?
I saw Granddaddy.
He was there.
He wanted you to have it.
He swore he'd only been
there a few hours.
Jason, he looked just
like we remember him.
Time stands still there,
and no one knows it.
It's how I lost a year of my life,
and Granddaddy lost twenty.
But where, where is he?
Well, you didn't leave
him there, did you?
Jason, he's gone. I'm sorry.
Like, he wanted you to
have that watch so that
you'd always know that he
never meant to leave you.
Hmm.
What time you got?
Which means...
My God.
Sookie!
Forgive me. I know
I'm not welcome.
I have not felt your
presence for over a year.
Well, I'm fine.
You were with Claudine?
It's none of your business
where I go or what I do.
Sookie, for over twelve
months I was so empty.
It was as if...
I thought you had died.
Well, I knew you
weren't dead.
Eric, not now.
I never lost hope.
Don't you have an
obligation at Fangtasia?
I don't think so.
I believe you do.
Pam can handle it.
They specifically want you.
Well, I appreciate your concern,
but we're fine, thank you.
Eric, go!
Apparently, I have to go.
But understand this. Everyone
who claims to love you,
your friends, your brother,
even Bill Compton,
they all gave up on you.
I
never
did.
Nice paint.
You have gotta be
shittin' me!
Happy to see you, too, Andy.
Geez. Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm safe, sound.
We all thought, uh...
They all thought that
I had killed you.
Well, when you're up to it,
come on down to the station.
We'll get your statement, track
down whoever it was that took ya.
Nobody took me.
What?
I wasn't kidnapped.
Don't tell me you skipped
town without tellin' no one.
You know how many man hours
I put into lookin' for you?
Hey, take it easy, Andy.
We dragged the fuckin' lake for you!
Where the hell'd you go?
Hey!
She was working for me.
Vampire business.
What? Are you kiddin' me? What
kind of vampire business?
For a whole year, you swore up and
down you had no idea where she was!
I deeply apologize for
misleading you, Sheriff.
Too many human lives would be at
risk if I did not keep it a secret.
Now, as you can see, Miss
Stackhouse is unharmed.
I'm back. I'm fine.
I will come down to the office
tomorrow, and I will explain it all.
And I will repay the costs
of the search effort,
as soon as you issue a
statement clearing my name.
Obviously, I did not kill her.
For thirteen straight months, I've
had that open case on my books.
If it weren't for you, this year's Louisiana
Safe Streets plaque would be on my wall,
and not fuckin'
Webster Parish!
All right, that's enough!
Andy, this ain't nothin' we
can't get into tomorrow.
You owe me a plaque!
Get in the car, you!
Get in the car.
I know I've lost an
entire year,
and I know you must have
been worried for me,
but in my mind,
it was only an hour ago that you broke
my heart into a million pieces.
I understand.
You're safe.
That's all that matters.
I'll leave you be.
Oh, no.
That's good.
I'm glad you're okay with...
I'm glad you're okay. Yeah.
Good night, Sookie.
You usin' again?
What? No!
I had maybe one drop this mornin',
but it's gone. I'm out.
You're out now.
LAFAYETTE: Five minutes.
The woman who
leads that group,
I've never seen anybody more hooked
in to the magic inside of her.
It'll be good for you.
Ten months.
Ten good motherfuckin' months I've
gone without a freak-ass vision,
and now you want me to go in there and
hang out with a bunch of witches.
In a coven.
It's not a coven.
First it was your fuckin'
meditation group.
Then it was...
It's different.
the Dallas Pagan Fair.
It's completely different, Lafayette.
Five minutes.
Ten if they got drinks.
Smell like where old air
fresheners go to die.
You'll get used to it.
Now, they're cool. Trust me.
They even got a
beaded curtain.
LAFAYETTE: Oh, hell no.
Hi.
KATIE: Look who's here.
So sorry we're late.
Oh, no. You haven't
missed anything.
Is this your, um...
Yeah, this is my partner.
Lafayette, this is Katie.
Hi.
Finally broke him down, huh?
I've been tryin' for ages.
We are so glad that
you joined us.
Oh, no. Wait. I'm not...
Did you tell 'em
I was joinin'?
That's uh, Marnie. We'll
introduce you to her later.
She look like she
could use a nap.
Oh, no. She's transported
herself to another plane.
That's how she can contact
the spirits of the dead.
Does she ever find anybody?
Well, it's like fishin'.
Cast your line into the dark, sometimes
you get a response, sometimes you don't.
On nights we don't, there's
always vodka. Mmm-hmm.
Greatest witch ever, huh?
Don't be an asshole.
Me?
But what she want me for?
Go on. It's okay.
Oh.
Uh, how y'all uh, doin'?
Uh...
Did you ever know
anyone named, uh, named Edith?
No.
Never. Um, I'm pretty sure.
Maybe in, uh, a
short form? Edie?
No.
But keep guessin'. You'll
get one right eventually.
Wait. Hold on.
Uh, Eddie?
Could be.
It's a common name.
Well, you lose someone
by that name recently?
We lost touch.
He's got something for you.
A rose.
Go on, take it.
Why would I want a rose?
They drained me, Lafayette.
But it's okay.
It was worth it
just to have a glass
of Merlot with you.
What the...
How did you fuckin' do that?
I, uh...
I didn't do anything. It
just came to me. I'm sorry.
You told 'em. He
fuckin' told you!
No, no, I swear I
didn't say anything.
I didn't say a thing.
Lafayette!
He was a spirit. I
can't live with him.
It's okay,
it's okay.
Oh!
Terry! Mama's home!
Hey, Mikey, baby.
Terry?
Terry? Get in here! Now!
What's up?
How in the hell
did this happen?
Coby and Lisa are at their Aunt Mona's.
I figure why not let him play with 'em.
You let him pull
their heads off.
Huh. No, he wasn't doin' that.
I just left him here for a
sec while I hit the head.
Well, how long were
you in there?
I don't know. Two
or three minutes.
Decapitating Barbie dolls.
What the hell
kind of baby does that?
Just boys. Regular,
ordinary, curious boys.
When I was a kid, I used to put
squirrel heads on lizard bodies
and invent new animals and...
He's a good boy, baby.
If he's got any of you
in him, he's good.
It ain't my half I'm
worried about.
Mikey,
Mama loves you so, so very much,
but you have got to understand.
Killing is wrong.
wastes no
time and
to go for
the female,
Hey, hon. How was work?
Just ten hours of layin' hot mix asphalt
next to a swamp full of mosquitoes.
How you think it was?
I'm starvin'.
Well, you got your pizza from
Monday still left, I think.
Uh, you remember I eat, right? Like food.
Be nice to have some in the house.
And you remember I
don't eat, don't ya?
Uh, you eat me.
I mean, a scrambled egg once in a while
doesn't seem like too much to ask.
Do you understand how gross
human food is to a vampire?
It's all dead.
Permanently forever dead.
Going to the Piggly Wiggly for me is
like going to the morgue for you.
You think bleeding out into your
mouth wasn't gross for me at first?
You get used to it.
I mean, honestly. How hard is
it? You crack one into a pan.
Fine. You want an egg?
How about a dozen
fucking eggs?
What the hell are
you doin'?
I'm cooking for ya.
Just like your mama.
Look, don't bring her into this.
That woman is dead to me!
Yeah, and if her aim
were any better,
I'd be a pile of goo and
she'd be making your eggs.
Your delicious fucking eggs!
You know what?
I'm not asking you for the moon, Jess!
You like 'em runny?
I don't give a crap.
I'm starvin'.
Good. Then God forbid
I overcook it!
Yep!
Mmm.
There. You happy?
Mmm.
How's it taste?
Mmm. Tastes great.
No, you know what? Tastes
just fuckin' scrumptious.
Quit it.
No, stop eating. You'll make
yourself... Damn, Hoyt.
There's nothin' funny...
about
your disgusting,
sorry-ass cookin'.
ANNOUNCER:
Well, TV sure hasn't gotten
any better in the past year.
Where's your uniform?
Shove over.
I'm not lettin' you
spend the night alone.
So you want with
marshmallow or without?
With.
Look, I know you must have been worried
for me, but you can't shadow me forever.
No, it ain't that, Sook.
Just...
having you back,
it's about the happiest
I've been in my entire life.
And I don't want it to end.
I love you, too.
I'm still mad you
sold the house.
Ugh.
You are not gonna let me
live that down, are you?
Tomorrow, I'm gonna call
Sid Matt and see if we can't
give those AIK people
their money back.
I'm keepin' the flat
screen, though.
Well, yeah. It's nice.
Yes, of course, Fangtasia
is for everyone.
Vampires, humans, men,
women, families, pets.
Everyone is welcome.
Come on down.
The blood is warm and
so is the service.
And do human families
have anything to fear
with vampire-owned
businesses in their community?
No.
Can you elaborate on that?
Human families have
nothin' to fear with
vampire-owned businesses
in their community.
Stop. Cut. That is
the man we want.
What? Pam not
so good?
She was fine, if you happen to
be blind and deaf and an idiot.
What's idiotic is that the AVL
believes the public to be so naive.
I have proof, scientific.
People are far dumber than they realize.
It's a post-Russell Edgington
world, everyone,
and we win back the human
public one smile at a time.
Now, can anyone here
play this game?
Action.
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen.
My name is Eric Northman.
I'm a tax-paying American and small business
owner in the great state of Louisiana.
I also happen to be a vampire.
You know, as the oldest
member of this community,
I would have been eligible to take
up residence here 110 years ago.
But it warms my heart to see the
most beloved folks of our town
taken care of in the
way that they deserve.
Now the past year, there's been a lot
of inflammatory talk from politicians
warning their constituents
not to trust vampires.
But think about
it for a second.
Who would you rather trust?
A vampire or a politician?
I must offer my gratitude for the
generosity and the open-mindedness
of the Bon Temps Chamber
of Commerce,
led by the redoubtable
Miss Portia Bellefleur.
The truth is, vampires are as different
from each other as humans are,
because we were humans,
and we ask only to
be treated as such.
I am also grateful
to be able to honor my wife,
Caroline,
who was a treasure of this
community for over 60 years.
And many of these trees on this
street were planted by her,
and all the other members
of the Arbor Society.
And it is my wish that this
center will grace our town
for as long as these trees
have stood around us.
And we welcome you into
our world as well.
We're always more than happy to
serve humans here at Fangtasia,
and I don't mean for dinner.
Now then.
We can't have a ribbon cuttin' without
the giant scissors. Mister Mayor.
Thank you, Mister Compton.
It's kinda nice not bein' the
oldest person here for a change.
Cut. There you go.
It's a disgusting habit.
It's my victory cigarette.
I totally let you win.
Hmm.
Hey.
Hmm.
Mmm.
Don't mind me. I don't want
to distract from the show.
Go on. Fuck off.
You take requests?
I'll give you ten if you eat each other out.
That's uh, five each.
I'm a seventh dan in Taekwondo,
so no, I don't take requests.
But I can crush your spine so bad
you'll be suckin' your own dick.
Naomi, it doesn't matter.
He won't remember any
of this tomorrow.
I will if I get me some of
that chocolate banana swirl.
How about twenty dollars?
Last time, pervert. We're
not fucking prostitutes.
Everyone's got a price.
NAOMI: That's it.
Fifty?
I'm sad for you, buddy.
Sad that you gotta hassle
women on the street.
Sad that you gotta make a asshole
of yourself for the attention,
and sad that you
gotta offer money,
'cause there ain't nothin' else
about you that's worth lovin'.
That's for me not reportin'
you for solicitation.
Come on, Toni.
SOOKIE: Oh, I'm so sorry
I missed your wedding.
ARLENE: No, it's okay.
Oh, we were all thinkin' the worst!
Okay, okay.
I can't breathe.
Well, especially Arlene.
You know where my mind went.
The man you loved turns
out to be a crazed killer...
He wasn't.
I know, but...
He wasn't.
Of course.
Still, we were gonna name
the baby after you.
But then it turned out to be a boy, and
there ain't no boy version of Sookie.
I can't wait to meet him.
Oh, well, you'll see.
He's uh, he's really, real kinda smart.
He is.
I'm gonna get my hug in
before my gumbo burn.
Next time, text a
motherfucker or somethin',
and save us all from
a world of worry.
I will. Uh, is Tara
working today?
No, she, she moved.
What?
Yeah.
Where to?
Honestly, Sook, I don't know.
She sent postcards.
A month in Houston,
next from Santa Fe.
But she seemed
to be doin' good.
I can't believe Tara
would just move away.
After what she'd
been through?
Yeah, okay. I guess I can.
Will you tell I asked for her?
Yeah. Yeah, next
time she writes.
Vampire business, huh?
I'm sorry. I can't
say anymore.
Must have been
pretty important
to keep everybody grieving
over you for a whole year.
I know what y'all must
have gone through.
No, no, you don't. 'Cause
you weren't here.
Hey, a lot's happened,
Sookie. A lot's changed.
Yeah.
You've gotten a
lot more prickly.
You start part-time.
Holly and Arlene got kids.
They need the shifts.
Are we still not talking?
You set me up.
What reason would I have to
purposely freak you out like that?
Tell me why you want me to be in
this crazy witch cult so bad.
You'd rather believe that I
would lure you into a cult,
than the possibility that
magic can really happen?
Mmm.
Marnie found Eddie on her own, man.
That's real. It's real magic. It's in her.
And it's in you, too.
I got by just fine my whole
life without no fuckin' magic.
When are you gonna stop denying
the fact that you've got a gift?
Ever since you realized it, you've
been fighting against yourself.
I care about you,
and I hate to see you run away from
the thing that makes you special.
That's why I want you
in my crazy witch cult.
I need a word with Mister Reynolds.
In private. Police matter.
Listen, we're uh, we're gonna
meet again tonight. You comin'?
I don't know.
Can I help you, Mister Po-Po?
Yes, uh, I uh, got a undercover
sort of thing on uh, narco.
Need me some uh, bait.
Why you tellin' me?
Don't talk to me
like I'm a idiot.
I'm the sheriff of this parish, with a
perfectly legal and legitimate need
for vampire blood.
Whoa. Whoa, now.
I gave my shit to those
extras over at Hot Shot,
and it damn near cost my
life gettin' out of there.
So you can check as many
orifices as you like.
I'm clean.
And I'm your Aunt Fanny.
JASON:
Don't, don't fuck with me.
I know you're slingin'!
Give it.
Andy, whoa, Andy!
Take it down.
This man is not a suspect,
he's not a person of interest,
he is not a witness,
and he is not a CI.
Right.
So we got no reason to
be questioning him.
Right.
Right.
Sorry.
Must have uh, got my
drag queens mixed up.
Hey, look.
I'm not sayin' anything happened just
now, but uh, if something did happen,
it didn't happen.
Okay?
MAXINE: Ow! Shitfire.
I have told you, Sam Merlotte,
people of all kinds need to eat.
Don't even have the decency to make
the front door handicap accessible.
Biscuits.
Yes, ma'am.
You gonna be comfy, hon?
You want a tushy cushion?
It's okay. I just want to be
treated like everybody else.
Extra gravy for ya.
And two teas.
Three sugars for me.
Splenda.
How's that leg today, Tommy?
Beats a sharp stick
in the eye.
Tommy, you wanna...
Oh.
Bless us, Lord, for these
gifts we're about to receive,
and for those gifts you've
bestowed upon us.
Amen.
Amen.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Super good today, Sam.
Thanks.
How's that physical
therapy I'm payin' for?
Well, could use a
couple more months.
How's that anger
management class?
Might need to go more often.
Mmm.
Whoa!
Mmm.
Shit.
Ugh, switch it off.
Babe, what's wrong?
It's uh...
from my dad.
My grandma passed.
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.
He texted that to you?
Yeah, they're not the
best communicators.
Do you need to go
home for the funeral?
You know what? I'll probably
just send flowers.
You sure? Toni, your family
would want you in Atlanta.
Nah.
I think I'm better off here.
Sid Matt, poor thing. He's been in and out
of the hospital nine, ten months now.
He tells me, "Portia,
the firm's all yours,"
but I think people still like to see
his name on the cards and signs.
Is the cappuccino okay?
It's in the ballpark.
I had to improvise.
No one's ever ordered a cappuccino here.
So I tracked down your buyer, AIK.
Turns out their address is
a PO box in the Caribbean.
Phone number is
an answering service.
I can keep on it,
but it may take some time.
You know my hourly rate.
I'm sure someone with your skill
can do it in half the time.
Honestly, they must
have put around
fifty thousand worth of
improvements into that house.
They'd at least want to
be compensated for that.
Can't we negotiate some kind
of settlement, a payment plan?
I'll get a hold of
someone at AIK.
Maybe we can appeal to
their sense of compassion.
Thank you.
There's a lifetime of memories
in that house for me.
of misery and
murder,
Bill okay?
I'm sorry, excuse me?
Can I send you a bill?
Oh yeah. Sure, of course.
Hey. Name's Matt.
Jessica.
Nice to meet you.
And I was thinkin' that you were way too
beautiful to be alone here tonight.
And I figure it
couldn't hurt to ask.
Actually, uh, I'm here
with my boyfriend.
Sorry.
It's my loss.
It's uh, O-neg with a
twist of B-five.
You dance with a
drink in your hand?
Sorry I lost my
temper with you.
I know.
I'm sorry, too.
HOYT: You glad we came?
I know it's been a while.
Yeah, I'm just, I'm just
gonna go touch myself up.
I'll be right back.
PAM: Toilets are for humans only.
Do I need to explain why?
Sorry, I just...
I needed a minute.
It's been ages.
Not a letter, a telegram, a smoke signal.
We've been worried sick about you.
Really?
Not really.
Well, I'm fine.
Me and Hoyt, we,
we moved in together.
That tree with the plaid
shirt, it has a name?
Well, he seems sweet and all, if
you're into that sort of thing,
but if you're making him bring you here,
I've got a hunch it's not enough.
Well, it was his idea. You
know, like a date night.
Mmm.
The way you're eye-fucking
fang-bangers from across the room,
that's especially romantic.
You had no reason to feel
guilty. You're a hunter.
You've never been on your own.
You live with a human. Monogamously.
Sorry. It's
just so ridiculous.
Don't you think if all I wanted
to do was kill and fuck,
that I'd be out there
doin' it right now?
Mmm.
Look, I don't even know what you
saw or what you think you saw,
but when I go home tonight, I'm
goin' home with the man I love,
and I'm just sorry
that you never had that.
But you know what
gets me the angriest?
SUZANNE: Hmm?
EMORY: What's that?
I thought I had it licked.
I finally cleaned out
Tommy's apartment.
Good for you.
Oh, well, that's great.
No. It brought it all back.
The...the sick feeling.
SUZANNE: Hmm.
And I knew it was wrong even
before I pulled the trigger.
It was like some other
person fired that gun,
and there was nothin' I
could do to stop him.
Oh, yeah. I've been there.
Mmm, me, too.
All of us.
Yeah, luckily, I didn't
have a gun at the time,
or I'd have been
a widow a long time ago.
It's primal, Sam.
We wouldn't be who we are
if we didn't get emotional.
You can even measure the
cortisol levels in your blood.
I bet we're all
just naturally higher.
You know what helps the
cortisol levels in my blood?
Mmm-hmm.
Gettin' drunk with y'all.
Well, hell. Let's crack
open another one then.
Let's crack one open.
Oh, I am near to
pickled as it is!
You in, Luna?
I gotta teach tomorrow.
Gotta teach?
It's public education. Who's
gonna know the difference?
Emory, no politics!
I will break out in hives.
All right, all right.
So are we ready to move on from wine then?
I am.
Yes.
Let's hit it.
Let's hit it.
SUZANNE: Whoo-hoo!
Can I get unzipped,
please?
Uh, that's it.
Thank you!
I have been looking
forward to this.
Please, please.
BOY: He's here! It's Jason!
Hey, y'all! Soup's on!
KIDS: Yay!
BOY: Y'all come on!
Hey, Timbo. Hey, Becky.
BOY: What do you have?
JASON: I did good
this time, guys.
GIRL: Can I have some?
Hot dogs, pork and
beans, and ice cream.
Ice cream!
You know what we do? We
save this for later, yeah.
Uh, Timbo, go put
that in the icebox.
BOY: Give me some.
Uh, oh, hey, hey!
Don't open it.
GIRL: Mister Jason, can I have some?
BOY: Let me have it.
How you doin'?
Come on over!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
At least let me
put it on the stove.
You gonna get sick if
you eat raw meat.
We ain't never got
sick before.
You want the rest
of my hangubber?
Ugh.
Yeah, we really need to get your
Aunt Crystal back here ASAP.
Y'all could use a mama,
and I could use a break.
Didn't you talk to
Aunt Crystal?
Not yet. But I could think
of one or two things
I'd like to tell her when
I do find her.
BOY: Let me have some of that!
Dude.
Hey, Mister Jason?
The, the ice box
ain't cold or nothin'.
Well, are you sure?
'Cause I just fixed it.
Come on.
Oh, shoot. You left it open?
Yeah, well, that's our
air conditionin'.
No wonder you busted it.
Now I'm gonna have to replace
the cooling element.
Oh!
JASON: Oh, fuck!
Wait! Timbo, what the...
Hey!
I'm gonna suffocate in here!
Come on.
Minerva was much more
than a pet to me.
She was my friend,
my companion,
my familiar.
I, I was wondering why
she stopped eating,
but now I realize it was
her way of telling me that
she had more work to do
in the spirit world.
I've uh, looked up a ritual
to ease her passage there.
Would you all join
me, for Minerva?
MARNIE: Guardians of life,
shadows of death,
we summon thee.
GROUP: Guardians of life,
shadows of death, we summon te.
Guide Minerva from our
realm to yours.
GROUP: Guide Minerva from
our realm to yours.
Guardians of life, shadows
of death, we summon thee.
GROUP: Guardians of life, shadows
of death, we summon thee.
Guide Minerva from
our realm to yours.
GROUP: Guide Minerva from
our realm to yours.
Restore within her
the spirit of life.
And return her to the
plane of the living.
Uh, Marnie?
Restore within her
the spirit of life.
And return her to the
plane of the living.
Marnie, we haven't
studied this.
You!
Join!
Um,
I'm sorry after all that trouble,
your bird's still dead.
It doesn't matter.
The king is expecting me.
Gate two. Miss Pelham is at
Garden One on foot toward you.
MAN: Copy that.
I have eyes on.
Your Majesty.
Good evening, Miss Pelham.
Please, sit anywhere.
What the hell!
Excuse me!
Mmm.
Such a strange sensation
when the reality matches
what you've pictured in
your mind so precisely.
Is this another dream?
It's been a year. How much of
your blood is left in me?
Oh, it's not a dream,
I assure you.
Then how are you here? I
rescinded your invitation.
You don't own the
house anymore.
I do.
Why would you do that? Why
would you buy my house?
Because I always
knew you were alive,
and if I owned the house,
then I would own you.
Sookie,
you
are
mine.
