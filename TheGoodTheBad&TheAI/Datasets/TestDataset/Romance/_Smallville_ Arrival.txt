Tell me what you've got
Jor-El: I've warned you that the elements
could not fall into the hands of a human.
The three must become one.
No!
In approximately 3 hours,
a meteor shower will hit Smallville.
I want you to have this.
I somehow know that it's meant for you.
Your curiousity always land you in
dangerous positions.
Lex: Where is it?
- You just want the stone, don't you?
I don't have the stone.
Lex: Who did this? You know more than
you're telling me, Chloe.
Who took the element?!
Lana, you're talking like we're never
going to see each other again.
I love you.
I love you too.
And now, the Season Premiere of
Smallville.
Jor-El: Kal-El, you have travelled far.
One journey has ended.
A new journey is about to begin.
Welcome home, my son.
Please don't hurt me.
Police: Lie down on the ground!
Police: Open fire!
Where's the girl?
She's irrelavent. We must find Kal-El.
Oh my god!
Jonathan: Martha!
Sweetheart!
Martha?
Mr. Kent? Are you OK?
Mrs. Kent? Clark?
Clark wasn't here. He's alright.
Martha?
Mrs. Kent?
Martha?
Here! She's here.
Oh god!
Sweetheart? I'm going to
get you out of here.
She's barely breathing.
She's going to be fine.
We're going to get you out of here.
Can you help me?
Come on.
Chloe?
Chloe?
Where did you go, Chloe?
Where'd you go, Chloe?
Everthing's under control here, officers.
I'm sure you're needed elsewhere.
He has the key.
Who are you?
Are you Kal-El?
Who wants to know?
This is not him.
Kal-El would not bleed.
Clark?
Clark!
I thought Krypton was destroyed.
Jor-El: It was. But here,
in your fortress of solitude,
the geography of our planet has been
replicated for your training.
I know there's a lot I can learn from you.
But I have to go home.
I'm needed there.
The meteor shower
is only the start.
A dark force from Krypton
has been awakened, Kal-El.
What do you want me to do?
That is the only way
to save this planet
Clark!
Chloe: Clark, can you hear me?
Help!
Clark!
Chloe!
You must continue your education.
You cannot stop.
She's my friend! She needs help!
Your destiny is far greater than
saving one human life.
No! I won't let her die!
you put the fate of
the entire planet at risk.
Please! I'm begging you!
You must return to me
before the sun sets.
I'll be back. I promise.
Do not fail, Kal-El!
Or the consequences will be grave.
You have my word.
Chloe: Hey.
I think it's time you switch into
Super-Clark mode now.
Super-Clark?
I know you run faster than
a speeding bullet, Clark.
Take me along for the ride.
Go Clark!
Lana! What happened?
They're still out there!
They'll kill us if they find us.
It's OK. You're safe now.
Lana, I'll call a doctor.
You don't understand.
We're not safe!
Don't touch me!
- Lana!
You're in shock. It's over!
The meteor shower stopped.
It's over.
There's a man and a woman.
They're right behind us!
They came out of a...
What did they come out of?
A space ship.
Where?
Lander's Field.
Lana, after what you've been through,
it's normal that your mind
is playing tricks on you.
No! Lex, you trust me.
I know what I saw.
We have to get as far away as possible.
Thank you.
I wonder who's more freaked out right now.
Me, knowing that I'm in a hospital where
they get their medicine by dog sled...
or you, finally finding out
that I know your secret.
How long have you known?
I guess I've always suspected. The quick
exits, the miraculous recoveries...
the lame excuses...
but when I saw you catch a car
like it was a beach ball...
that confirmed everything.
Why didn't you say anything?
I figured that you would,
when you were ready.
on your terms, not on mine.
You're a good friend, Chloe.
Obviously not good enough.
There were so many times
I wanted to tell you.
Clark, I don't blame you.
What about Lana? Does she know?
No.
Well, I want you to know that
I will never tell anyone.
I will keep your secret safe.
No matter what.
I appreciate that.
I still have a few questions, though.
Like, how did we get transported from
the cave to the North Pole?
And what was going on in that ice cave?
Chloe, there are a lot of things that
even I don't understand.
The meteor rocks...
they didn't make me who I am.
So you were born this way?
I wasn't born anywhere near Smallville.
In fact, I wasn't born in this galaxy.
Okay...
So that would make you like an...
Yeah.
Uh, but you look so...
human?
I'm still the same person.
Clark, I...
I think you're so amazing.
You save people's lives and
take no credit for it.
To me, you're more than just a hero.
You're a Super hero.
Chloe...
I'm serious, Clark. If more humans were
like you, the world would be a better place.
News: ... Smallville was hit by the
second meteor shower in 16 years...
They didn't get out.
My parents didn't get out.
Smallville needs you more than I do, Clark.
Go.
Go!
Whoa.
Mr. Luthor.
Are you okay?
They are desciples of Zard.
They must be stopped.
You're talking about the
people from the ship!
Their home is their only poison.
Their home is their only poison.
Where are they?
Oh, Martha Kent. If you're trying to scare
me, you're doing a very good job!
For a minute I thought I lost you.
I guess I've found my way back.
Has Clark come home?
Sweetheart, please. You need to rest.
Don't worry about Clark.
Our son can handle anything
that is thrown his way.
Mrs. Kent! I must say,
you look much better...
without a cabinet on your back!
Hi Lois. It's good to see you.
Lois was quite a hero out there.
You guys are very kind to me.
I'm glad I could help.
Where is Kal-El?
Who are you?
You know where he is.
I'm sorry, lady. I don't know
who you're talking about.
Hey! Everyone needs to calm down, OK?
So put the nice man down.
Look, super freak. You want to find Kal-El?
Then you better start working on
your communication skills.
I know where Kal-El is.
He's hiding at the Luthor mansion.
I can take you to him.
Mum!
Dad?
Clark!
Thank god you're okay.
- Where's my mum and dad?
At the hospital. Your mum has a head
injury and a broken leg, but she'll be okay.
She's out of danger now.
What about Lana?
Lana's safe.
It's Chloe I'm worried about.
Why?
Clark, she was down in the cave with me
when the meteors hit.
I was knocked out. But
when I woke up she was gone.
She must have escaped while
you were unconcious.
Or someone helped her.
What? You think I did?
Lex, how could I...
Before I fainted, there was a light
brighter than anything I've ever seen.
I swear, I saw you standing right there,
in the middle of the light.
I was not at the caves.
If you weren't with your parents when the
meteors hit, where have you been?
They insisted that I must get out of
Smallville. I got a ride on a military van.
Then why do I feel that you are not
being honest with me?
I have no idea.
I'm beginning to think that
you have a habit of lying, Clark.
I don't have to listen to this.
Then tell me the truth.
If you're my friend, just tell me the truth.
Were you in the cave when the meteors hit?
No.
I understand that the police have their
hands full, but Mr. and Mrs. "Universe"...
they're killing people!
Lois!
Clark! You're okay?
Yeah, you?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Have you seen my parents?
They're going to be fine.
Where are they?
Actually, umm...
we have another problem...
kind of a big problem, really.
A happy loving couple came in here with
Super powers and really bad attitude.
It got pretty ugly.
What did they want?
They were looking for some guy named Kal-El.
Have you heard of him?
Where did they go?
Kal-El is in there.
It's a trap!
Get the door! Seal it!
Lying is their way.
Not for long.
I heard you were looking for me.
I'm Kal-El.
At last!
Who are you?
The last survivors of Krypton.
What do you want?
We want you to join us, Kal-El.
And help us make this savage land
our utopia.
I saw what you did at the hospital.
It's not utopia... it's murder!
The few must be sacrificed for
the sake of the many.
Then sacrifice me.
Because I'm not going to
let you kill anyone else.
If that is your decision, so be it, Kal-El.
We cannot destroy you, Kal-El.
But we can lock you in a place where
you will never be able to stop us.
It is done.
Oh, Clark!
Are you okay?
Where are they?
They're gone.
Do you know who they were?
We need to get you to a hospital.
Ah!
Oh my god!
Our home!
It's just wood and plaster, Martha.
Our family is still standing.
We might be a little bruised...
but I think we're stronger because of it.
You're right. A house can always be rebuilt.
It doesn't hurt to have a one-man
construction team as a son.
Hi!
Hi.
Don't worry, Clark. Things are going to
get back to normal soon enough.
Actually, things will be a lot more
normal around here than you think.
My powers are gone.
How?
Jor-El took them.
But I think it's not a bad thing.
All I ever wanted was to be normal.
And now, finally...
I am.
I don't think that this adjustment
is going to be easy, Clark.
That's why I'm lucky to
have parents like you.
Everytime I discovered a new ability,
you were always there to help me adjust.
This time is not different.
It is different!
You can get hurt now.
You're vulnerable!
Isn't that what it means to be human?
No. I can't imagine Jor-El
giving up on you that easily.
I took care of the danger
he warned me about.
I think the consequence of that is
losing my abilities.
Look, it's all in the past now.
I'm ready to take a step to the future.
Let's start by rebuilding this house.
One board at a time.
Clark?
Now, how could Clark possibly be here?
We're in the middle of the Yukon.
I don't know...
I must have been dreaming.
What's going on, Lex?
I came to take you home.
Clark!
Really, you shouldn't have.
Actually, I didn't.
You're too sweet for words.
What happened to your voice?
That's what happened when you get a neck
massage from Barbie the barbarian.
The doctor said I shouldn't talk too much.
Gee, that's too bad.
Don't be too happy, Clark.
It's not permanent.
I have to get to the airport.
My dad will kill me if I'm late.
I wanted to say thank you.
You were there for my parents.
It means a lot to me.
I'm sure it does.
But...
not enough to give me these flowers.
She's in room 258.
I hope irises are still your
favourite flowers.
Some things stay number 1 forever.
Thank you.
Lana, before the meteor shower,
when you came by the barn...
you said some things...
and 3 words sort of stood out.
Clark, this guy was just about
to fall down on us...
I never knew if I'd
ever to see you again.
Right...
We were in the middle of a crisis.
Sometimes people say things they don't mean.
Clark...
I meant every word.
The question is...
did you?
No more secrets.
No more lies.
Clark, I want to ask you something...
Do you believe in life on other planets?
Actually, I do.
I saw something in that crator.
It was a space ship, Clark!
It was unbelievable.
