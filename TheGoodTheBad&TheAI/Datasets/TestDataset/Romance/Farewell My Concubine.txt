Who are you?
We're with
the opera troupe.
Oh, I didn't recognize you!
I'm a great fan of you both.
Is that so? Thank you.
It's been over twenty years since
you performed together, hasn't it?
Twenty-one.
Twenty-two.
Yes, twenty-two years.
And it's been ten years
since we last saw each other.
Eleven. Eleven years.
that's right, eleven years. Yes.
It's due to the Gang of Four
and the Cultural Revolution.
Right!
Yeah, that's right.
Things are better now.
that's for sure.
Everything's fine now.
Please, wait here a moment.
I'll go turn on the lights.
Sorry to trouble you.
BEIJI NG - THE WARLORD ERA
Yanhong, is that you?
I've really missed you.
Whore!
Ladies and gentlemen,
enjoy the show!
You, cunning asshole!
Laizi is trying to run away again.
Brat! See how far you get!
Quick, go catch him!
I'm sorry.
Gentlemen, please be patient.
Trash ! how dare you
show yourselves around here?
Fuck you all !
Just as sure as my name
is Shitou. . .
I'll give you something
to look at.
What are you screaming for?
I haven't even said hello yet!
You're a disgrace to
the opera troupe.
You couldn't even
play a monkey right.
Thought you'd get away
with that brick act, didn't you?
It's garbage.
Sharpen your knives!
Sharpen your knives!
This child isn't fated
to be an actor.
Not with that extra finger.
He have a good face,
but he can't.
Sharpen your knives!
I can afford to raise him. . .
but he's getting too big
to keep at the brothel.
If only you take him,
you can do anything you like.
Don't look down on us.
don't be foolish.
Prostitutes and actors
are equally despised
by society.
Just go away.
Ma, my hands are freezing.
They feel like ice.
Ma!
Get away from us,
you son of a whore!
It's from the whore house!
Drop it on the foor!
Are you bullying him?
Come over here.
Sleep with me!
You're really something !
Laizi, go snuggle up
with the Little Monk.
Catch !
It's so cold outside. . .
the piss froze
on the tip of my dick.
I nearly turned
a somersault!
If you belong to the human
race, you go to the opera.
Pigs and dogs
don't listen to opera.
If you don't go to the opera,
you're not a human being.
And where there's opera,
there's work for us actors!
Stop squealing !
Straighten that back!
If you think
you're above everyone else. . .
you'll learn the hard way.
This is just the beginning.
Don't worry, Douzi.
We're already half way
through.
Shitou, are you helping
someone cheat?
Master, I was looking up.
I didn't notice what was on the floor.
Bullshit! Get me my sword.
And hurry up!
Get up!
Don't you have something to say?
Yes. Forming cliques is
prohibited and wi'll be punished.
He's not fucking scared
of anything.
From the time opera began. . .
It's never enjoyed such
popularity as it does today!
You're lucky to be part of it!
We are!
Heavens will...
not a lack of material skill. . .
I've been practicing
kung fu
to keep myself warm.
It's cool out side, quite cool.
But I've become a man of fire.
Get away from me.
I am so strong,
I can uproot the Mountains. .
My courage is renowned
I've fallen on bad times
Yet even my horse
Won't run away to save itself.
These are our rules.
We must learn them well.
From ancient times,
man has needed a skill.
If you devote yourself to this,
you'll get paid off.
Now go off and practice!
Let's hear Fleeing by Night.
I look back at the Celestial Court
and hurry on wards in fight. . .
Heedless of. . . heedless of. . .
Heedless of what?
Heedless of loyalty
and filial piety.
I am so strong,
I can uproot the mountains.
Yet even my horse
Won't run away to save itself.
And my beloved concubine,
what shall I do about her?
Excellent, not a word out of place.
Give me your hand.
This is so you'll remember
to do as well the next time.
I am a nun. .
At sixteen I am a nun.
My hair is shorn at youth's prime.
Go on.
I am by nature a boy...
I am by nature a boy...
You are by nature a girl !
I'll punish you, Laizi !
You still can't get it right, can you?
Don't hit me!
I won't do it again !
I am. . . I am by nature. . .
Spit it out!
I am by nature a boy. . .
Is a nun a male or a female?
A. . .
A boy. . .
You really are in character.
You can't even tell male from female.
I-l-l am by nature a boy. . .
You've forgotten everything
the master has taught you!
Do it again, and I'll beat you
within an inch of your life.
You'd better remember this.
If by chance
I'm beaten to death tomorrow. . .
The three copper coins
hidden under my mattress.
Careful !
Don't water your hand !
Douzi, in a few days, you'll be
initiated into the troupe.
Just pretend you're a girl,
and don't mess up the lyrics again.
Laizi, have you ever eaten
sweet pea cakes?
Whats the big deal
about sweet peacakes?
How about millet rolls?
Basin cakes?
The're about as fucking
special as dog farts.
So what do you like?
There's nothing yummier
than a stick of candied crab apples.
If I make it big, I'll eat candied
crab apples every day for dinner.
Candied crab apples for sale!
Candied crab apples for sale!
Don't look at us like that.
We're not sticks of apple.
Laizi,
you're drooling !
Laizi,
What the hell are you doing?
Wow, so many big kites!
Douzi, we got only 2 days
to go.
Run for it!
Come back!
Douzi !
we got 2days. .
Don't forget the money
under my pillow.
You're worthless.
Get out of my sight!
Where'd you get that?
Forget Shitou.
I'm spending your money now.
Ten apples on each stick.
I'll give you two.
What's wrong with you?
I have to pee real bad.
Not in the middle
of the street.
It's Manager Wang !
The stars have arrived !
here, come this way.
My dear sir, this is like
a visit from heaven !
All you need to do is sneeze
and you get a standing ovation.
Thanks for coming here.
We'll be lucky if no one
is trampled to death in there!
I'll sit on your shoulders
for a while, then you sit on mine.
The king !
It's the King of Chu!
What does it take
to become a star?
How many beatings?
When I'll ever enjoy
such fame?
You're pissing all over me!
Are you nuts?
I knew you'd go back.
You couldn't live without Shitou!
We're going to get a taste of
the sword. But I'm not afraid.
For me, it's like having
an itch scratched.
I've eaten my candied crab apple.
I'm a fucking star already.
You little runts,
you've come back after all.
Good ! I deserve it!
Good ! I deserve it!
Why the hell did you
Let them go?
Die you runts!
Skipping class and running away
must be punished !
Master, I'll never do it again.
Please let me go!
You let them get away?
Assholes!
Master!
I wouldn't dare do it again,
master. I was wrong.
Beat me instead !
Didn't you think youd get yours?
I'll kill you!
Douzi,
speak! Say something !
Beg for mercy!
Say he's beaten you well !
Speak!
Let's just disband the troupe!
Youre killing Douzi !
I won't let you do this!
Master Guan !
Laizi, he-
This opera tells the story of war
between the Chu and han kings.
What sort of a man
was the King of Chu?
A peerless
and invincible hero. . .
a bold and resourceful general
capable of defeating vast armies.
But fate wasn't on his side.
At Gaixia he was outwitted. . .
by the Han king.
As they prepared for battle,
Han's troops sang victory songs. . .
because of Han's military tatics,
the Chu armies fed in a
great panic
had their country taken by Han.
Even the king was weeping.
No matter how resourceful
you are. . .
you can't fight fate.
The king had once been
all-powerful, but in the end. . .
all he had left was one woman
and one horse.
He tried to get his steed
to run away, but it wouldn't go.
he wanted his concubine to free,
but she wouldn't.
For the very last time, Concubine
poured wine for her king. . .
and danced for him
with a sword. . .
then cut her throat with it,
to keep her fidelity.
Theres a lesson in this story
for all of us. . .
that each person is responsible
for his or her own fate.
You better keep that
in your mind.
I am so strong,
I can uproot the Mountains
My courage is renowned
I've fallen on bad times
Yet even my horse won't
run away to save itself
Old Man Zhang has commissioned
you to hire an opera troupe.
I truly congratulate you.
With your patronage, the children
will have new clothes to wear.
Good opera, however,
is not so simple.
When he was a palace eunuch. . .
Old Man Zhang attended operas
with the Empress Dowager herself.
I could lose a lot of respect.
But that's nothing.
You realize that if the performance
doesn't make the grade...
This kids got something.
How long he's been in training?
Douzi, come here
and pay your respects.
he's got
a nice little figure too.
Can you sing any
old-style operas?
Yes, two.
Fleeing by Night is for male and
outside the Nunnery is for female...
Let's hear a bit of the last.
At sixteen I am a nun. . .
my hair shorn
at youths prime.
Yet I am by nature a boy,
not a girl...
Why-
Mr. Na, I am terribly sorry!
he's usually very good.
Master Guan,
I'll see you some other time.
Open your mouth. open it!
You've screwed it up
for all of us!
I'll teach you.
I am by nature a girl,
I am by nature a girl,
At sixteen I am a nun. . .
my hair shorn at youths prime.
Yet I am by nature a girl,
not a boy.
Why must I wear
these sexless robes?
I see the joyful couples pass. . .
in their splendid brocades.
Despite myself,
desire burns in my heart. . .
Year after year
All over the land
I've followed my king
on his military campaigns
enduring the wind
And frost and hard toil. .
Our people are fallen
into abyss of misery. .
This little boy. . .
Master Guan. . .
Mr. Zhang, may you live
as long as South Mountain.
The king is here.
Your highness
The people have suffered
untold hardship and pain
this is an old man Zhan's special
reward for two kids.
So take this.
Yes, sir!
The Chu king would
have won with this sword !
If I were emperor,
then you'd be queen of the palace.
Take that sword.
Careful, kidys!
That's a real blade!
No need to run !
What's wrong?
The sweat stings the scratchs
Have them go together.
No way.
It's an old rule around here.
Master Guan, I'm sorry
if you don't understand.
The concubine has to die
one way or the other.
Isn't it so?
Master?
Douzi !
What year is this?
This is. . . this is 1932.
Wrong !
This is still the Ching dynasty!
Come over here.
I. . . I want to find Shitou.
I need to pee.
Pee into this.
Don't waste it.
just pee into this.
Come to me!
Douzi !
What's happened to you?
Have you gone dumb?
Speak to me!
Douzi.
Fate has determined
each of our lots.
Leave him to his destiny.
All right, look at the camera!
Gentlemen, you have done
grandly for yourselves.
You look so dignified and stunning
in any style of clothing.
That's it!
Oppose Japans invasion
of North China!
Damn !
It's those students again.
ON THE EVE OF WAR WITH JAPAN
Down with Japanese imperialism!
Are'nt they the opera actors?
How can you put on make up
and sing opera at a time like this?
Have you no feeling
for your country?
We're Chinese too,
Chinese to the core!
Look at us,
goddamn it!
Chinese mustn't fight
among themselves!
we're all Chinese here!
And don ' t you forget it!
How dare they pretend
to be patriotic!
Why don't they go out
and fight the Japanese soldiers?
Cause you're penniless
for women and marriage. .
Do something !
You just want to find
a way out...
The one who was yelling the
loudest would make a good actor.
Remember the first time we
performed Farewell, My Concubine?
Only you remember
that kind of thing.
I know.
It was your lucky day
for you.
Back then it was...
I went there yesterday.
I know you've been looking
for the sword, but it's long gone.
Long life for Deyie!
Candied crab apples for sale!
Candied crab apples for sale!
We've got a sea of people.
They're craning their necks
to catch a glimpse of their idols.
Even master Yuan is here to see
you. It's a great honor for us.
Go away!
Go away!
Mr. Duan. . .
They're becoming impatient,
please hurry!
Trust me.
They won't feel like they are
wasting their money.
Year after year
all over the land
I've followed my king
on his military campaigns
You be the judge.
Has he not blurred
I hate only the lawless tyrant
Who plunged our people. . .of misery
the distinction between theater
and. . . male and female?
He is now at the level of. .
Your highness
Ive caused you
So much grief
So, Master Yuan has come
to see us tonight.
I know. I sang so loudly,
I drowned out the horns.
I'll show him how great
we are without his patronage. .
But Duan. .
Don't worry.
At key moments. . .
I squeezed my waist
with my hands. . .
so it hurts. .
here?
Master Yuan !
It's an honor.
You deserve this.
the Empress Dowager herself. . .
never bestowed such a gift
upon her favorite actors.
Master Yuan, how can our Dieyi
be worthy of your favor?
Farewell, My Concubine
has a long history.
It evolved from the old-style opera
Story of the Precious one.
Many famous actors
have fallen down in this role.
I've never seen an actor
as great as you are.
Impressive.
For a moment or two. . .
this Yuan fellow
was so entranced. . .
He believed Concubine Yu
had actually come back to life!
Master Duan. . .
When the king returns to camp
and meets Concubine Yu. . .
custom has it-
He takes seven steps.
You take but five.
If the King of Chu fails to bear
himself with majestic dignity. . .
He's little better than a gangster
putting on airs!
Master Yuan, you are a master
of the theater arts.
You are an expert in all the
varieties and facets of opera.
I may probably be
as you say.
Please give us the benefit
of your advice and criticism.
If it's not beneath you,
I'd like to invite you. . .
to my humble home for some wine.
There is still so much
to be said about this opera.
Im terribly sorry, Master Yuan.
I've another drinking
engagement... with a courtesan.
With a courtesan...
