Shit!
RUSSIAN DOLLS
They can't pay me for two months.
But they said...
And this will interest you.
Because I'm like you.
I said,
"That's scandalous! You can't do that.
"France has strict laws
protecting writers."
I was very, very angry.
What is of interest here?
Well, they said,
since they couldn't pay me
in a timely fashion,
when they do pay me,
they'll take a "late penalty"
into account.
Meaning? I don't understand.
Since they're late,
they'll pay me more.
How much more?
I think they said, "Much, much more."
We typically need writers like you
for personalities
who are writing their memoirs
and can't put two words together.
Can you do that?
Ghostwriting?
Yes... no... that's...
Sure, I can be a ghostwriter.
I think...
I preferred to work there.
I can ghostwrite for anyone.
I love fiction
when it's connected to reality...
There was a huge amount
of work there...
Know what I mean?
Plum has a roundness, a warmth,
a certain femininity, yet elegance...
Some guys like hot dog or freestyle.
So you need different gear.
Hardware's always been reliable.
OS X makes the difference.
- You mean the equipment?
- No, the ride.
It's chic, not la-di-da.
Hip, yet cool.
- For me, you gotta go freestyle.
- That's color!
Doesn't that kill the trees?
So...
Do you trim them several times a year?
- What do you think?
- Yes? No?
I don't know. I have no idea.
Do grapes grow in winter?
You've been busting my balls
for an hour.
I'm a Parisian,
I don't know this plant shit.
I'm like you,
I got a boring shit job.
I don't give a fuck.
If my questions are stupid,
don't answer and I'll take off!
A little on edge, are we?
Sorry. I haven't slept,
I'm having a shitty day.
Yeah, I'm on edge.
- You Parisians!
- Stop! Enough!
Laurent!
Stop! That side's fine.
The façade's clear!
- When's your shit due?
- In two weeks.
We're doing a special "love series"
by young writers this summer.
Oh, I'd love to.
We read your story with great interest.
It has enormous quality,
but a few scenes
did make us flinch.
More than flinch, even.
Scene 57.
Why doesn't John Edward kiss Odile
during the thunderstorm?
Yes, why? We want them to kiss.
I want them to kiss.
I don't know.
I didn't want to be too cliché.
We so expect it, it's more interesting
if they don't kiss.
But why deprive the audience
of that pleasure?
It airs over the holidays.
It's a marvelous gift to our viewers.
Don't be afraid of clichés.
I more than agree.
It's a sequel.
was a huge hit.
The audience is clamoring for
Go for it.
Everyone's dying to see how John Edward
and Odile finally fall in love.
John Edward's handsome,
Odile's beautiful,
they're in Venice,
the most beautiful city in the world!
Let yourself go, Xavier!
We all love postcards.
We all love sunsets.
Why deny us that?
Put them in gondolas!
I must sell Wooded Bliss.
But why, John Edward?
Why?
I'm getting a divorce.
Does your wife know?
Yes.
I've told her everything.
But that's marvelous.
Ridiculous!
- It's not ridiculous.
- Come on...
You hate love stories.
Lots of people love them.
It's not ridiculous to them.
So, you're doing the sequel?
Well, I hope it pays well.
It pays better than my articles.
So it's  to your book?
I can't do everything at once.
Did you like it, Lucas?
I liked it a lot.
But who can that be?
Are you expecting anyone?
L'Auberge Espagnole,
Yes.
Yes, who? Yes, what?
Can't you say who you are?
Everyone else does, why can't you?
What do you want me to say?
"It's your mommy?"
Everyone else does.
Why can't you?
Gimme a break!
You want me to be like everyone else.
It's grampa...
Hold on.
I was sure you'd forget.
Hi, it's Martine.
I'm on the other line.
Quick!
Okay, go ahead.
- About tonight...
- Oh, happy birthday.
You didn't forget?
You done?
Mom, hold on. It's Martine.
It's her birthday.
Wish her happy birthday for me.
My mother says, "Happy birthday."
- What time tonight?
- He expects you for dinner tonight.
I don't know, nine.
That works.
I gotta go.
Hold on. Not you, mom.
Give me...
The code.
Okay, I've really gotta go...
Mom, hold on!
- Hi, Mrs. Lopez.
- You have to pick up your mail.
It's been piling up for a week.
Can I borrow a DVD?
You done yet?
I caught you off guard the other day,
and now I'm a little off guard...
Coming, mom.
I'll stop back later.
All clear? Can I talk now?
I'll be there!
Hey...
You know what?
The Big Bang theory doesn't work.
They said on the radio this morning
it may not be true.
Well, no one knows for sure.
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.
- But who can it be?
- I don't know.
Oh, Barbara, what does this mean?
I thought I'd find you here.
So, she's the one.
You disappoint me.
I thought she'd at least be...
She'd be what?
Yeah, she'd be what?
Excuse me.
What's your girlfriend like?
It's not for my girlfriend.
I don't have a girlfriend.
What's this girl
who's not your girlfriend like?
She's a little shorter than you.
She has smaller... I mean...
I think she's size one or two.
It depends. Is she thinner than I am?
Is she like that girl?
No.
She's more like her.
But not as ugly.
Take the two.
Your girlfriend can always exchange it.
The register's over there.
I love your hair.
I prefer that you leave.
Really?
I'm sorry, I'm very modest.
Look, I've gotta run.
Okay, I'm going!
I wasn't chasing you out.
Don't sweat it. I'm outta here!
That was great. I had a blast.
Thanks a lot.
Why are you talking like that?
Because I'm a big jerk.
Bye.
Not to be too insistent...
this really isn't for my girlfriend.
It's no biggie. Who cares?
I don't have a girlfriend.
It's for my ex. For her birthday.
I'll give you my number.
For?
I don't know.
If the dress doesn't fit,
you can call me.
No, I don't know.
I've always dreamed of doing that
but I never dared.
With you, I thought I should dare.
Take it, 'cause I feel like a jerk.
I'll jot it down.
But you have to call tonight.
Or you never will.
There.
I don't know.
Yes, yes!
You've got nothing to lose.
If I were you, I'd call me.
I also wrote an article for snowb...
for a magazine about winter sports.
What about your novel?
Yeah.
I'm trying, but it's not easy.
At least these little jobs
help me pay the rent.
This is temporary.
Be careful.
Sometimes these temporary things
can last a long time.
Meaning?
Don't forget to write important things.
You're good at that. You always were.
Let's eat. I'm hungry.
I'll tell Aïcha.
So, little Xavier,
when do I get to meet your fiancée?
Uh, yeah...
Well, yeah, that's right...
I'm a size one. You know that!
You think I'm fat.
It's okay. I can exchange it.
I never wear dresses.
Why do you girls have
such a problem with dresses?
First, I'm not "girls."
I wear pants.
It's more practical on a bike.
Anyway, thank you very much.
It's...
No, it's pretty. Really.
Now you'll say I'm a pain.
You're a pain.
No, thanks.
Really?
By the way...
there's the Social Forum.
It's in Porto Alegre, in Brazil.
I can't miss that.
Could you maybe?
I can take care of Lucas.
Does he ever see his father?
I'd rather not discuss it.
It's that bad?
Yeah.
You with anyone?
No.
- You?
- No.
Hello, thirties!
Kassia?
Oh, yeah!
How are you?
I'm glad you called.
Sure I know who you are!
No, no bother at all.
What are you doing?
Good morning.
More coffee?
No, I really have to go.
I just wanted to say...
What?
It's stupid. I just wanted to say...
I never do that.
We'll talk later?
You in love?
Something's going on.
I really like black girls.
You like anything with a pussy!
Why'd you say that?
You cruise every chick on the street.
But me, I don't get the time of day!
- Stop!
- Stop what?
I'm really embarrassed to ask,
but I'm in deep shit.
Thomas got dumped by his girlfriend.
He's taking the apartment back.
Can I stay with you or?
No problem, Xavier.
- Oh, really?
- What?
He moves in
and you don't even ask me?
No! You piss me off.
All you do is give me shit!
It's my place
and I don't need your permission
to invite a friend over.
If it's not the moment...
Fine.
Carol!
I'm really mortified. I hope...
No, it's fine.
It's just fine.
Cool. When are you coming?
Xavier?
You're here already!
Cool! All moved in?
Yeah.
Great.
I won't bother you guys. I've got work.
No sweat. We broke up.
We're both bachelors now, buddy.
- Great!
- Cool, huh?
- Great!
- How about a beer?
Come on in.
I'm impressed.
You like it?
It's really nice!
There's Xavier.
- I think you met.
- Oh, right.
I remember.
Well, I'm...
I'll show you around.
It's really nice.
Well, it's not...
Did you decorate it?
Come, see the bedroom.
Right over here.
Make yourself at home.
Careful, it'll fall.
See them, Lucas?
That doesn't hurt the trees.
It makes them stronger.
Take my number.
I'll stop by and we can discuss it.
- That's so nice.
- Not at all.
Come on!
Thank you!
That's so nice.
I didn't know what to do.
You have to take care of flowers!
It's crazy!
People think nature just grows.
We humans have to nurture it.
And euphorbia...
People always over-water them.
Even once a week is too much.
I'll stop by.
Two seconds.
"Happy to have finally found her prince,
she agreed to marry him.
"The wedding went on for a week,
"and all the kingdom was invited.
"They had a beautiful castle
"and lived happily ever after."
Go to sleep now, Lucas.
Wanna go pee-pee?
Don't you wanna go pee-pee first?
Hasn't mommy found her prince yet?
Well, I don't really know.
- Has she mentioned it?
- No.
Then I guess
she hasn't found him. But...
she's beautiful, she's intelligent...
I've been with seven guys, uh...
seven princes.
I've lived in different castles.
Xavier was the fourth prince.
At the moment,
I've got a bunch of princes going.
I don't know... I hesitate.
Last week, I met one at a club.
Like a ball, a great ball.
I really like him.
He doesn't have a huge castle
but he's got a big motorcycle.
You'd like that.
It's complicated...
Even if things go well,
it's still a little too soon to...
to know if there'll be a wedding.
And then
some people
in the kingdom say,
if he's the one,
they won't come to the wedding.
Don't cry, mommy.
Mommy!
What's the matter?
- Don't you want your apple?
- No.
There's some left!
You don't want anymore.
Look who's here!
It's mommy!
My sweetie pie!
You okay?
Hi.
He was really sick.
He's gotta go to bed.
Really?
I'll put him to bed. I'm wiped out.
So, what happened?
The doctor came because I was sick.
Really?
So how was Porto Alegre?
It was great!
There were 216 countries there!
Every continent!
Chili, Mali, Montenegro...
Tibet!
It was so moving just to be there.
It really makes you feel
connected to the planet.
Did you all agree
to save a doomed world?
Hold on!
Give me shit if you want to, but...
globalization
isn't only generating progress.
We have to unite to fight against
disasters that could become inevitable.
You've got the schpeel down.
What's your problem?
While you're saving the world,
I take care of your kid,
I haven't slept in three nights
and I...
You what?
You've done zip with your life.
Me?
With those sappy stories of yours?
You lull silly schoolgirls
into dreamland.
"They kiss before the sunset..."
Bullshit.
But what do they dream about?
Pieces of shit.
You know what?
Your work is a load of crap.
It's been crap for two years.
And I know you're better than that.
Wait a minute, I...
You don't give a shit.
You get your lousy two bits,
you're nice and cozy with that.
So you make fun of people who move,
who fight against pollution,
against exclusion, against violence.
Against real things in the real world!
It's easy for you to laugh at that.
That's for sure!
I don't laugh.
You're a parasite.
- I'm a what?
- A parasite.
Happy as a clam,
telling insipid love stories.
That's how it should be!
Don't change a thing.
That seems to satisfy you.
Xavier...
I'm sorry. Really.
And thanks for Lucas.
What's wrong, John Edward?
Nothing.
Yes, there is.
I can see something's wrong.
I have a terrible secret.
What do you mean?
The company's bankrupt.
I haven't a cent.
The bank called, I'm drowning.
I have a terrible secret.
What do you mean?
I'm having an affair with Sarah.
My mother's ill,
your dad sold the company
and I've had a car accident.
That's awful!
I have a twin brother, John Sebastian.
- We look exactly alike.
- And?
I'm not me, Odile.
I'm the twin.
What does that mean?
I don't know.
- Wanna go?
- Maybe.
You okay?
How can I write a love story?
I know nothing about love.
I'm a self-centered egotist.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
Careful! Hold me tight.
I've got you. Wait!
Let's go. Be careful.
- You okay?
- Fine.
Watch it here. We have to stop.
We have to wait for the second light.
- Okay.
- Careful!
It's dangerous.
By the way,
when do I get to meet your fiancée?
- I forgot!
- What do you mean? It's important.
Yeah, I know.
Hello, Kassia?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Really?
When's she due back from Senegal?
Really?
No big deal. It's Xavier.
Thanks. Bye.
What is it?
Can you come here a sec?
Coming.
So, I...
You okay? Have a good day?
- Great.
- What's up?
I have a huge favor to ask.
Something you'll hate.
But you absolutely have to say yes.
What?
Somewhere in your closet,
do you have a dress?
A dress?
Never mind, it'll never work.
- It'll be a nightmare.
- I don't have a dress.
- What would I do with a dress?
- I'm sorry.
Stay calm. Don't freak out
and say, "I'm a dyke!"
Don't make it worse. I'm here!
Just a warning.
I'm already
a hair's breath from walking.
This is ridiculous.
Look at this thing.
Shall I go get them, darling?
No, we can go later...
Good evening!
After dinner.
But that's so very kind of you,
my dear.
Or we can blow off the whole thing.
It's so, so pretty here.
Don't talk like that.
- Quit fucking around!
- Isn't that what you want?
Stop! Concentrate.
Quit it!
I'm ringing the bell.
Go ahead.
What are you doing? I'm not ready!
Hello.
Hi, grampa.
Hello, sir.
I'm so happy to meet you. Come in!
Isabelle, grampa.
Delighted! Fuck!
- Careful!
- Sorry. Fuck.
Hello, my boy.
Follow me.
I'm so happy to meet you.
Me too. Really!
It's so, so, so pretty.
Isn't it?
Stop!
Want to know how old I am?
I'm 98. I've seen three wars.
That's incredible!
Extraordinary!
I was born in 1906.
But I won't bore you with all that.
Can you imagine
hearing my life story?
That'd take hours...
Let's talk about you, miss.
I'm so happy
my grandson has such a pretty fiancée!
Oh, no...
Oh, yes, I insist, very pretty.
Thank you, that's very kind of you.
So, tell me,
what do you do for a living?
Well...
So...
I work for a television station,
where I'm a financial journalist.
Well, what does that mean?
It means I work in the financial world.
I gather tidbits of information
on financial markets, stock options,
what's bought, what's sold.
Because traders
- people who work in the market -
need an enormous amount
of info... rmation
on an enormous number...
of things.
Who's interested in all that?
Lots and lots of people.
There are 450 assets management
firms in Paris alone.
It's a very competitive sector.
You gotta kick the other guy
in the balls.
Things move fast,
tons of money's at stake.
Once, I got a tip that
Asian markets were about to collapse.
I had to react like that!
For a trader,
that's an explosive situation.
You gotta be on the ball.
That info has gigantic repercussions
on the planet.
What?
I can't do this.
One hour. We're gonna eat. Please.
- Let's go.
- One little hour.
Now I see why you slipped away.
Dinner's ready.
Let's go to the table.
- Go ahead.
- No, you first.
Come on.
Water?
I feel dirty...
just pretending to be so clean.
Xavier,
the woman you want doesn't exist.
You've gotta grow up.
You want a princess or...
worse, a TV soap heroine!
Stop dreaming!
Princesses only exist in fairytales.
That was bullshit.
Why stop dreaming?
You wanna go out?
Yeah! Because now...
But this time I decide what we do.
I want her so, so pretty.
I'll think I'm king of the world.
No, thanks.
You're having fun!
Xavier's a cute little dish.
You're having fun!
You piggies!
- You okay?
- Yeah, great.
- She'll be beautiful!
- When'll my wife be ready?
Gimme a break.
That's better, isn't it?
Okay, I got it.
Shake your ass!
It suits him!
Have you met my wife?
Telephone.
Is this yours, cupcake?
Yeah, that's mine.
Hello? Xavier?
My pet...
No, that's Isabelle.
You okay?
Yeah. Why?
I don't know, you sound funny.
It's just...
Lucas' father just picked him up.
He's sleeping over tonight and...
That's a good thing.
My wife's always on the phone.
That may be her lover.
And I'm all alone.
Who's calling you at this hour?
Your son shouldn't just see women.
Yeah, it's great.
But...
It's just that...
Can I come over?
Yeah, come over.
No, come over.
No bother at all.
Hi.
- You're wearing makeup?
- Really?
Yes, you are. It looks nice.
I see you girls are having fun.
So what's the matter?
- Martine, you okay?
- Hi.
How are you?
Good to see you. Come in.
Come on in.
It's really funny.
I just got
I didn't have that one.
Anyway, it's not easy.
We must seem like
uptight straight people.
That may be true.
I think that's a bad idea.
Just for tonight.
It's really not a good idea.
You are uptight, after all.
I'm not uptight. I just don't want to.
It's a question of wanting to.
I adore you, but I don't wanna
sleep with you. And neither do you.
I am a pain in the ass.
No, you're not.
I'll never find a guy.
You're right, I'm annoying.
I broke up with Bruno.
Did I mention him?
Sorry, they change so fast,
I can't keep track.
I don't get it. Since you,
I just don't meet guys who...
I don't know.
You expect too much.
You're looking for an ideal guy
who doesn't exist.
You're a big girl now, Martine.
Stop dreaming of "Mr. Perfect."
Do something!
Come on.
Let's go to my room.
Why are you crying?
Okay, you are a pain,
but you're beautiful, intelligent...
Lots of guys are crazy about you.
I don't give a shit about that.
What if you were a ball-breaker,
ugly, stupid
and no one was hot for you?
You're far from that.
What guys are crazy about me?
I don't know...
Patrick. He said you drive him wild.
Really? Patrick said that?
- He said, "Martine drives me wild?"
- Yes!
You seem surprised. There's something
attractive about you, after all.
Okay! You say it like...
Can I sleep with you tonight?
Please.
If you want to.
Shit!
Morning!
Thank you. I'm happy I stayed with you.
Yeah, but you can't stay.
I'm expecting a girl... friend.
It's no big deal.
Just tell her the truth.
We're old friends and we didn't fuck.
Yeah, sure.
She's your girlfriend?
Yeah.
- You have a girlfriend?
- No, not really.
Is she your girlfriend or not?
I don't have a girlfriend,
I have girlfriends.
Do you have a girlfriend or not?
I don't have one, I have lots.
Is that clear?
Oh! I forgot how you were.
Flip out on your own time!
I'm outta here.
Well, yeah.
She's on her way. It'll be a mess.
I have a life. Last night,
you didn't give me a chance to explain
that I had to juggle things
this morning.
Bye.
I'm sorry.
I was afraid you'd run into her.
I understand.
Fuck!
- Who is she?
- No one.
I'm no one?
I'm no one?
You have your life, I have mine.
No problem!
But you'll always be someone to me.
Always.
In anyone's presence.
- Who is she?
- No...
My ex, Martine.
Not so "ex".
She is my ex. It's over. Come in.
One in, one out...
That doesn't bother you at all.
You don't understand.
You just line 'em up.
You don't give a fuck.
Exactly.
If you don't like it, take a hike.
What?
Yeah! You're all fucking,
stupid bitches!
You got that? Now get lost!
Asshole.
Yeah, I'm an asshole!
You can't talk to women like that.
Asshole!
Who is she? I'm a what?
Stop! Calm down. You...
I what?
She can't talk to me like that.
You parade your sluts through here...
Fuck, Xavier!
It's not easy for a woman my age
to find a good man.
A good man's hard to find.
Yeah, I know.
I want you to meet him.
But no comments!
Chill out, ma! You're not 15.
I know what it's like not to find
your soul mate right away.
Don't worry, I've been briefed.
Still, we humans are a funny race.
Did you know that
a hippopotamus chooses one mate
and they stay together for life?
Did you know that?
No.
Isn't that marvelous?
This is it?
- He lives here?
- Yeah.
- You, too?
- For three months now.
Okay, I get it.
- You get what?
- Why he's a good man.
- Stop!
- I see why you're with him.
No comments. You promised.
- Are you freaking out?
- No.
Yes, you are.
You'll make me freak out for real.
We used to cut the world in two.
Capitalists, Marxists; exploiters,
exploited; the Right, the Left.
That worked pretty well.
Those oppositions don't work anymore.
Today, one world strips women bare,
another veils them.
That's the real opposition today.
In our image of women.
Yeah, that's true.

Oh, really?
Sorry. We know how much you've
invested in
You're a victim of globalization.
Hold on, I speak English.
Meaning?
You think you can write in English?
Of course. I've even written
screenplays in English.
Can we submit them
to our co-producers?
Yes.
Well, that's a bit complicated...
I wrote them when I was in Barcelona...
I think the publisher's production arm
may have gone bankrupt.
Hello, Paris!
I'm a Parisian!
Gimme some escargot and red wine!
Do you speak French?
Wanna sleep with me?
Hi. I was talking about the lights.
I have to work a little longer.
Just a bit.
I need...
the light.
To work. Like that.
Like the sun.
On stage.
Thank you very much.
I'll just be a little while.
My name is Natasha.
Thank you, William.
Bye.
It was good?
Thank you.
You liked it?
In what way?
You liked the way I danced?
You liked it. Okay. Thanks.
Bye.
Natasha!
Do you remember me?
Yes, I remember.
A year ago, when you got on that bus,
you gave me this little piece of paper.
I decided to learn Russian
just so I could speak to you.
I've dreamed of this moment.
I'm staying at the Moskva Hotel.
This time,
I'll give you a little piece of paper.
I apologize if this is... weird.
Call me.
If you want to.
Okay.
We proposed your English screenwriter.
They know her well.
They agreed.
You can leave for London anytime.
All travel and expenses
will be reimbursed.
Great!
We certainly owe you that.
