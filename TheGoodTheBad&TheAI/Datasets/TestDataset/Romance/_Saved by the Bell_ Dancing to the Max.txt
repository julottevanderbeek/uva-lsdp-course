Hey everybody,
attention please!
No, no, no.
l just got a telegram.
All:
Ooh!
'''Dance Party'
has selected 'The Max'
for a televised dance contest
with all those great kids
from Bayside, next Saturday.''
And it's signed...
''Casey Kasem!''
- Let me see that.
- Cool, a dance contest!
How about you and l
enter in the contest?
We could win it all.
Win? With you?
Your feet need training wheels.
Winning, losing?
Dancing is supposed to be fun.
Well, it will be fun--
if Kelly dances with me.
Well, gee, guys, l'd love to be
partners with both of you.
Why don't you just go
with the best dancer?
Hit it.
Wow, Slater, that was hot.
Are you kidding?
l moved better last summer
when a bee flew in my shorts.
l'm waiting, ''Preppie.''
Let's see what you got.
Move back, give him room.
Hot feet coming through!
Slater, l could beat you now with
three toes tied behind my back.
You think
a better dancer than
Go practice first,
then we'll have a real dance-off.
Wow, a dancing duel.
How exciting!
Hey Lisa, my horoscope says
we're destined to dance together.
My horoscope says,
''Beware of dorks.''
Well, l'll protect you
from them!
Hey Jessie, you want to be
my partner for the dance contest?
Gee Danny, l'd love to.
Actually, no. l don't believe
in dance contests.
Then why don't we just
skip the contest and kiss all night?
Bye, Danny.
Hmm...
skip the date and start
with a goodnight kiss?
That Danny has good ideas.
Jessie:
This cannot be right.
Tell me something is wrong with
this scale before l hyperventilate.
The only thing wrong with that scale
is the flake who's on it.
l have grown an inch taller
since lunch. l feel like a giant.
You are not a giant.
You're a bright, sensitive,
popular girl.
Everyone ''looks up''
to you.
Thanks a lot.
l mean, what's going to happen to me
if l keep growing?
Stand tall. Be proud.
And practice your slam dunk.
Before l begin l have to make
a very sad announcement.
Beethoven's alive?
Very amusing, Mr. Morris.
No, unfortunately
l have to conduct
two music classes today,
simultaneously.
Poor Mrs. Wickham slipped
and got her head stuck in a tuba.
Well maybe they should get
''Fat Tommy'' to blow her out.
Good suggestion.
All right, people, today,
we're going to play a piece
by Johann Sebastian Bach.
A piece?
Why can't we play
the whole thing?
All right people, instruments up!
One bar for nothing.
One, and two, and three,
and...
Oh! Thrilling!
Bach always gives me chills.
Keep playing my little
l'll be right
l mean, back.
Beautiful, beautiful!
l'm getting chills.
Are you feeling
what l'm feeling?
Yes sir, it was
the fish sticks at lunch.
You are what you eat,
Powers.
All right, let me hear
the horns!
No chewing gum in class,
Mr. Morris.
All right, piano!
Elegantly played, Powers.
Let's hear strings and flute!
You're moving me,
you're moving me.
Slater:
All right, move it, Jessie!
Kelly:
Whoo! Shake it, girl!
Zack, why don't you show Kelly
what a great dancer you are?
Not now, Screech.
Go ahead, Zack,
l'm dying to see you dance.
Yeah, dazzle us,
Preppie.
Wonderful. This is why
l went into teaching.
Wonderful, wonderful.
Now a little faster tempo.
Yes.
There you are.
Lovely.
Huh? Wait a minute.
People, it's a little too...
Cut it back.
That's a little too bright, people.
- Where are you taking me?
-
Slow down, people!
lt's too fast!
People, please!
Surcease!
Jessie, l'm in big trouble.
What'd you do? Try to sell
your parents' house again?
l can't dance.
l've been faking it for years.
lf you can't dance,
why'd you challenge Slater?
lf Kelly and Slater enter
that contest, they're going to win.
That means their names
are going to be on the trophy.
Together... touching.
- So?
- So, l've got to stop them.
l can't allow them
to ''name-neck.''
Ugh.
Jessie, you're a terrific dancer.
Come on, you've got to help me.
Sure l'll help.
Let's see a few of your best moves.
Come on.
So, what do you think?
l think you should go
with Screech.
- Come in.
Mr. Belding?
My name's Casey Kasem.
l'm here to talk about
the dance party at The Max.
''Details coming up,
right after l return.''
Just kidding.
Casey Kasem!
Wow.
l heard
about the dance party.
ls there anything
l can do to help?
l'm the ''Big Bopper''
around here.
Well actually,
there is one thing.
Well, sit down
and lay it upon me, ''Big 'C.'''
At ''Dance Party'' we try to get
the support of the local schools.
Say no more. You want me
to help you host the event.
That hadn't occurred to me.
l know.
You heard about me winning
the 1963 ''Chubby Checker Twist-Off.''
Here's a little taste.
Let's twist again,
like we did last summer
Yeah, let's twist again,
like we did last year.
You want me to recreate
that moment, right?
Well actually, l was hoping
l could borrow a school banner.
A banner?
That's all?
That's all, ''Bopper.''
Well okay, l'll present it
to you on the show.
Gee, that'd be great.
But l can take it right now.
l don't have one right now.
l'll bring it to you.
Oh, Zack, when are you
going to have the dance-off?
l need to know
who my partner is.
Well, Slater will be humiliated
the day after tomorrow.
Are you really
that much better than him?
Every summer while the other kids
were playing baseball,
l was at dance camp.
Wow, l can't wait.
Why did l say that?
Zack:
Whatever you're doing, don't.
My darling, be my partner,
and this could be you.
So what do you say?
Pick you up, seven-ish?
Forget it, Screech.
She's already going with me.
Lisa, is that true?
Sorry Screech, he asked me
this morning. Come on.
lt's all your fault.
l told you to let me lead.
- Whoo! You're doing great.
- l am?
Hey, l am, aren't l?
Okay now, here's a new step
l just invented.
- Awesome.
- Come on. Do it with me.
Slater's going to freak out
when he sees this.
Whoo!
Let's take five.
Yeah, let's cool down.
You're new at this.
Thanks.
You're a terrific dancer.
Yeah, well, l went to dance camp
when l was a kid.
They actually have those?
l can't believe
you're not entering the contest.
No big deal.
You're not into some
strange religion, are you?
- No.
- Then what's the problem?
Zack, l don't want
to talk about it, okay?
- Would you like to dance with me?
- l can't. l'm bigger than you.
And l'm still growing
at this very moment.
Too bad. Maybe l should have asked
Hey Jessie, let's dance.
l'm too big for you.
l'm too big for everyone.
- Jessie, is that you up there?
- Yes, it's me.
You don't want
to dance with me, do you?
l can't.
Everybody will laugh at us.
Zack, l do have a problem--
l'm too tall.
Well, l haven't noticed
anyone measuring you lately.
That's because
they can't reach me.
Zack, you don't know
what it's like to be ''the freak''--
taller than all the boys--
the jokes, the looks, the whispers.
- Stop looking up at me!
- Look at the bright side.
At least you're the first one
to know when it rains.
Zack!
l'm sorry. Come on, there's
lots of guys taller than you.
Name one.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?
Come on, Screech, cheer up.
lt can't be that bad.
lt's no use trying
to look stud-like anymore.
l think this time it's really over
between me and Lisa.
Look, you can't give up.
l heard if Byron hadn't asked Lisa
first, she'd have gone with you.
l know.
l started that rumor.
Well then maybe you should
start looking for someone else.
l can't. l've been crazy about her
since kindergarten,
when l glued my face
to the back of her sweater.
So you've been ''stuck on her''
a long time, huh?
But what's the use?
The story never changes.
There's the beautiful princess,
the dashing frog,
and the wart he left behind.
Come on, Screech, l think
you're being too hard on yourself.
-
- Who is it?
- Can l come in?
- Zack?
This is the first time in 11 years
you've come through the door.
Well, there's a special reason.
Here.
These are for you.
Oh, they're beautiful.
We have the same kind
growing in our yard.
Not anymore.
Well, this is just to say thanks
for helping me.
We're not finished yet.
We still have one more lesson.
-
- Pretend l'm Kelly.
''Oh Zack. Help me choose
between you and Slater.''
Voilà!
Lisa, what happened
to you?
l kicked the TV
and sprained my ankle.
Why?
Watching the new Revlon commercial--
they discontinued my nail polish.
That was a dumb thing
to do.
Where were you ''Miss Pretty Pants,''
when l needed that advice?
Lisa, this is terrible.
l feel awful.
Don't worry about it, Byron.
l'll be okay.
Yeah, but can you dance
on that ankle?
Well, the doctor said
there's a chance.
''A chance''?
Well, l can't take that chance.
l really want to win this contest.
Byron, what are you saying?
l'm going to have to go
with my back-up, Didi Garrison.
How could you do that
to me?
Hey, let's ''pants'' him.
Better start running now, punk, or
there's going to be a ''full moon.''
Yeah, and don't show your face
around here again!
Hold me back, Slater! Hold me back!
No one hurts my woman!
He's a fool, Lisa.
You're hot no matter what.
You're strange,
but thanks, Screech.
lf you like strange,
l'm your man.
- Well guys, it's the big moment.
- What?
Zack, dance for me and help me
choose between you and Slater.
Kelly, do yourself a favor,
go with Slater.
- Zack, what are you saying?
- Yeah, what are you up to, Preppie?
Well, nothing.
l've decided to go with Jessie.
Jessie?
lf that's what you
really want, Zack.
Come on, Slater.
Let's go practice.
- Will you go with me?
- l'd love to be your partner.
Didn't your mother
ever tell you not to slouch?
You're much prettier
when you stand up straight.
- Thanks.
- Oh, and one other thing--
don't forget your high heels.
You might need them.
Can l have
your attention, please?
lt's now my pleasure to introduce
the star of ''Dance Party.''
Let's give him
a-- ''big hand.''
The golden voice
from the Golden State...
Casey Kasem!
Max, thank you.
And thank you for letting us
use this great hangout
for our dance contest this week.
- Now, is everybody ready?
-
You know, through the years,
l've been to a lot of schools.
l've met a lot of principals,
but l have never met a principal
who is so caring, so involved,
and so
as your own
''Big Bopper'' Belding.
Thank you, ''Caseman.''
- Now can l have the banner?
- Of course.
One minute, everybody.
Stand by and enjoy yourselves.
- l could twist  sing.
- Let go of the microphone.
And now,
the big moment--
the announcement
of our three finalists
who will all dance for you
one more time,
and then we'll pick the big winner
with your applause.
- Ready with the applause meter?
- Ready, Casey.
Our first finalists,
the exciting ''Spandex Twins''...
Kelly Kapowski
and AC Slater.
All right, very good.
Now for finalists number two,
the ''Powerhouse Preppies,''
welcome Zack Morris
and Jessie Spano.
All right,
now for our final couple,
with a new dance they've invented
called ''The Sprain,''
Screech Powers and Lisa Turtle.
Bring 'em on.
Hey, there is no doubt
about it.
We have a winner.
lt is Screech and Lisa!
All right.
Well, that's a ''good night'' from us
here at ''Dance Party,'' everybody.
Till next time,
this is Casey Kasem saying,
''Keep your feet on the ground
and keep reaching for the stars.''
Come on, everybody, let's do--
''The Sprain''!
Boy:
Work, Casey!
