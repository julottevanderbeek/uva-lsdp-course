Okay.
PHIL: Renee, come on.
Guys, come on. I love you both.
We got a plane to catch.
Your  longer.
I cut it since the last time I saw you.
Guess it grew out again.
I've cleared some shelves off
in the bathroom.
Right. One bathroom.
a pretty good work lamp.
The sales lady picked out the bed stuff.
You like purple, right?
cool.
Thanks.
Okay.
Heard you guys coming
all the way down the road.
Good to see you.
- Bella, you remember Billy Black.
- Yeah.
- Wow, you're looking good.
- Well,  still dancing.
glad you're finally here.
Charlie here  shut up about it
since you told him you were coming.
All right, keep exaggerating.
I'll roll you into the mud.
After I ram you in the ankles.
- CHARLIE: You want to go?
- Yeah.
Bring it.
- Hi,  Jacob.
- Hey.
We used to make mud pies
when we were little.
Right. No, I remember.
Are they always like this?
-  getting worse with old age.
- Good.
So, what do you think?
Of what?
- Your homecoming present.
- This?
- Just bought it off Billy here.
- Yep.
- I totally rebuilt the engine for you.
- Come on.
Oh, my gosh!
This is perfect. Are you joking me?
Sorry.
I told you  love it.
down with the kids.
Oh, yeah, dude. You're the bomb.
Okay.
Listen, you gotta double-pump
the clutch when you shift,
but besides that, you should be good.
-  this one?
- Yeah. Yeah, right there.
All right.
Do you want a ride to school or something?
I go to school on the reservation.
- Right, right.
- Yeah.
too bad.
It would've been nice to know one person.
- Nice ride.
- Thanks.
Good one.
You're Isabella Swan, the new girl.
Hi,  Eric, the eyes and ears of this place.
Anything you need, tour guide,
lunch date, shoulder to cry on?
really kind of the more
suffer-in-silence type.
Good headline for your feature.
on the paper,
and you're news, baby, front page.
No,  not.
You...
Please  have any sort of...
Chillax. No feature.
- Okay, thanks.
- Cool?
GIRL: All right. Okay. Yeah.
GIRL: Get it! Get it! Get it!
GIRL 1: To you!
Whoa!
sorry.
I told them not to let me play.
No way. No, no, no.
That's... That's... Don't...
You're Isabella, right?
Just Bella.
Yeah. Hey,  Mike Newton.
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, yeah.
-  got a great spike, huh?
-  Yeah, it's...
Jessica, by the way.
Hey, you're from Arizona, right?
Yeah.
people from Arizona
supposed to be, like, really tan?
Yeah.
Maybe  why they kicked me out.
You're good.
so funny.
- Back in, Jess.
- BOY: Down here.
ERIC: Like a masterpiece, you know,
we'll have, like,
this crazy pyramid fall from the sky,
- and then you guys can...
-  my pleasure, Madame.
- You guys can give each other high fives.
- Burrito, my friend?
- Hey, Mikey! You met my home girl, Bella?
- Hey.
Your home girl?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- That's...
- My girl.
Sorry I had to mess up your game, Mike!
Tyler.
TYLER: Yes!
Oh, my God.
like first grade all over again.
You're the shiny new toy.
Smile.
- Okay.
- Sorry.
I needed a candid for the feature.
The  dead, Angela.
bring it up again.
okay, I just...
I got your back, baby.
Guess we'll just run another editorial
on teen drinking.
You know,
you can always go for eating disorders.
Speedo padding on the swim team.
Actually,  a good one.
- Kirk. Right?  exactly what I thought.
-  Yeah.
ANGELA: We're talking Olympic-size.
JESSICA:  so skinny.
It  make sense.
- ANGELA: Totally.
- Yeah.
Who are they?
The Cullens.
They're Dr. And Mrs.  foster kids.
They moved down here from Alaska,
like, a few years ago.
They kind of keep to themselves.
Yeah, 'cause they're all together.
Like, together, together.
The blonde girl,  Rosalie,
and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett,
they're, like, a thing.
legal.
Jess, they're not actually related.
Yeah, but they live together.  weird.
And, okay, the little dark-haired  Alice.
really weird,
and  with Jasper, the blond one
who looks like  in pain.
Dr.  like this foster dadlmatchmaker.
Maybe he'll adopt me.
he?
Edward Cullen.
totally gorgeous, obviously,
but apparently nobody
good enough for him.
Like I care, you know?
So, yeah.
JESSICA: Seriously, like,
waste your time.
I  planning on it.
- Mr. Molina.
- Hey, Mike.
Oh, yes. Miss Swan.
Hi. Can I have the pass? Thank you.
Welcome to the class.
Here.  your stuff, okay?
And I got a seat for you right here,
so come over.
The last one.
Just follow along till you catch up.
All right, guys, today we are gonna be
observing the behavior of
aka flatworms.
So what we're gonna do...
...regenerate.
Zombie worms.
No cell phones. Guys,  get to it.
Gentle, gentle, certain areas.
Please just  cut here.
We  cut here.
You  believe this.
try to focus
while we check those out, huh, guys?
EDWARD: There must be something open.
- Physics? Biochem?
- WOMAN: No, every class is full.
Just a minute, dear.
afraid you'll have to stay in biology.
Fine. Just... I'll just have to endure it.
I just  get over how grown up you are.
And so gorgeous.
Hey, Bella.
You remember me?
I played Santa one year.
Yeah, Waylon, she  had
a Christmas here since she was four.
I bet I made an impression, though,  I?
- You always do.
- Butt-crack Santa?
Hey, kids love those little bottles, though.
All right,
let the girl eat her garden burger, Waylon.
As soon as you're done,
I will bring you your favorite.
Berry cobbler, remember?
Your dad still has it. Every Thursday.
Thank you.  be great.
CHARLIE: Here.
Thanks.
Mom,  your cell?
Okay,  laugh.
I  lose my power cord. It ran away.
Screaming. I literally repel technology now.
- I miss you.
- Oh, baby, I miss you, too.
But tell me more about your school.
Now, what are the kids like?
Well,
they're all very welcoming.
Tell me all about it.
It  even matter.
I have homework to do. I'll talk to you later.
Love you, too.
Bella!
- You all right?
- Yeah,  good.
Ice  really help the uncoordinated.
Yeah.  why I had
some new tires put on the truck.
Old ones were getting pretty bald.
Well, probably be late for dinner.
I gotta head down to Mason County.
Security guard at the Grisham Mill
got killed by some kind of animal.
An animal?
You're not in Phoenix anymore, Bells.
Anyway, I figured  lend a hand.
- Be careful.
- Always am.
- And thanks for the tires.
- Yeah.
ERIC: Prom Committee is a chick thing,
but I gotta cover it for the paper anyway,
and they need a guy
to help choose the music,
so I need your play list.
Hey, listen, I was wondering,
did you have a date to...
up, Arizona? Huh?
How you liking the rain, girl?
Better get used to it, girl.
Yeah, Mike, hey, you're real cute, man.
- Oh, I know...
- That was really awesome.
ERIC: Why you shooting down my game?
Let a playa play.
MIKE: Yeah, okay.
What you playing at, T-Ball?
Hello.
get a chance
to introduce myself last week.
Edward Cullen.
You're Bella?
Yes.
Onion root tip cells,
on your slides right now.
Okay? So, separate and label them
into the phases of mitosis,
and the first partners that get it right
are gonna win the Golden Onion.
BOY: All right, good.
Ladies first.
You were gone.
Yeah.
I was out of town for a couple of days.
Personal reasons.
Prophase.
Do you mind if I look?
prophase.
Like I said.
So are you enjoying the rain?
What?
You're asking me about the weather?
Yeah, I...
I guess I am.
Well, I  really like the rain.
Any cold, wet thing, I  really...
- What?
- Nothing.
anaphase.
- You mind if I check?
- Sure.
Anaphase.
Like I said.
If you hate the cold and the rain so much,
you move to the wettest place
in the continental US?
complicated.
sure I can keep up.
My mom remarried, and...
So you  like the guy, or...
No,  not...
really nice.
metaphase. You want to check it?
I believe you.
Why  you move
with your mother and Phil?
Well,  a minor league baseball player,
and he travels a lot,
and my mom stayed home with me,
but I knew it made her unhappy,
so I figured  stay with my dad for a while.
And now you're unhappy.
- No.
-  just...
just trying to figure you out.
You're very difficult for me to read.
Hey, did you get contacts?
No.
Your eyes were black
the last time I saw you,
and now they're, like, golden brown.
Yeah, I know,  the...
the fluorescents.
- ALL: Bella!
- Bella!
GIRL: Dial 911!
BOY: I already called.
They're gonna send somebody over soon.
Bella,  so sorry. I panicked.
Bella, I've got 911 on the phone now.
Bella. You okay?
You and I are gonna talk. You all right?
fine, Dad. Calm down.
sorry, Bella. I tried to stop.
I know.  okay.
No. It sure as hell is not okay.
Dad, it  his fault.
You could've been killed.
You understand that?
Yes. But I wasn't, so...
You can kiss your license goodbye.
- I heard the  daughter was here.
- CHARLIE: Dr. Cullen.
Charlie.
I've got this one, Jackie.
Isabella.
Bella.
Well, Bella, looks like you took quite a spill.
How do you feel?
Good.
Look here.
You might experience some
post-traumatic stress or disorientation,
but your vitals look good.
No signs of any head trauma.
I think you'll be just fine.
TYLER:  really...
You know,
it would've been a whole lot worse
if Edward  there.
He knocked me out of the way.
Edward? Your boy?
Yeah, it was amazing.
I mean, he got to me so fast.
He was nowhere near me.
Sounds like you were very lucky.
Charlie.
I gotta go sign some paperwork.
You should...
You should probably call your mom.
Did you tell her?
probably just
freaking out.
ROSALIE: Fifteen kids that saw
what happened.
EDWARD: What was I supposed to do, then?
Let her die?
This  about all of us.
CARLISLE: I think we should
take this in my office.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Rosalie.
What?
How did you get over to me so fast?
I was standing right next to you, Bella.
No. You were next to your car,
across the lot.
No, I wasn't.
Yes, you were.
Bella, you're... You hit your head.
I think you're confused.
I know what I saw.
And what exactly was that?
You...
You stopped the van.
You pushed it away with your hand.
Well,  gonna believe you, so...
I  gonna tell anybody.
I just need to know the truth.
you just thank me and get over it?
Thank you.
- You're not gonna let this go, are you?
- No.
Well, then I hope you enjoy disappointment.
I need  permission slips, okay?
- Sammy, please collect them.
- Yeah.
Guys,  go.
Come on, get in. In.  go!
Look at you, huh? You're alive.
- I know, yeah. False alarm, I guess.
- Yeah.
Now, I wanted to ask you,
you know, if, you know,
like a month away, but...
Do you wanna go to prom with me?
So, what do you think?
- About what?
- Do you want to go?
To prom?
With me?
I...
Prom.
Dancing.
Not such a good idea for me.
I have something that weekend anyway.
going to Jacksonville that weekend.
You  go another weekend?
Non-refundable ticket.
You should ask Jessica.
I know she wants to go with you.
All right. All right.
MOLINA: Yo, yo, yo. Hey, guys, come on.
We gotta go. We gotta go.
Green is what? Good.
go. Guys, come on.
Other bus, other bus.  go.
Compost is cool.
Now, stuff that in there, Eric.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Very good, very good.
Now, I am gonna make a steaming cup
of compost tea.
- Okay.
- Give me that.
Yeah. This is recycling
in its most basic form, guys.
for the plants.
in Jacksonville?
How did you know about that?
You  answer my question.
You  answer any of mine, so...
I mean, you  even say hi to me.
Hi.
Are you gonna tell me
how you stopped the van?
Yeah. I had an adrenaline rush.
very common. You can Google it.
Floridians.
in Jacksonville.
Can you at least watch where you walk?
Look,  being rude all the time.
I just think  the best way.
Bella! Guess who just asked me to prom.
Who?
Yeah, I actually totally thought
that Mike was gonna ask you.
-  not gonna be weird, though, right?
- No. Zero weirdness.
- You guys are great together.
- I know, right?
- Tyler...
- BOY: Gross.
Bella, look.  a worm.
a worm.
Bella, we  be friends.
You really should've figured
that out a little earlier.
I mean, why  you just
let the van crush me
and save yourself all this regret?
What, you think I regret saving you?
I can see that you do.
I just... I  know why.
You  know anything.
Hi.
Are you gonna be riding with us?
No, our bus is full.
Your mom called. Again.
Well,  your fault.
You  have told her
about the "almost" accident. You finished?
Yeah.
Yeah, I suppose you're right.
She always did know how to worry.
She seems different.
She seems happy.
Phil sounds like an all right guy.
Yeah, he is.
All right.
ERIC: No, you need the mitts.
You need them.
No, why do you keep arguing with me?
You just need them.
- ERIC: You're gonna get frostbite!
- I  even know.
ERIC: Yeah. Hey!
- La Push, baby. You in?
- Should I know what that means?
La Push Beach down at the Quileute Rez.
We're all going tomorrow.
- Yeah,  a big swell coming in.
- And I  just surf the Internet.
Eric, you stood up once,
and it was a foam board.
But  whale watching, too.
Come with us.
La Push, baby.  La Push.
Okay, I'll go if you stop saying that, okay?
Seriously, dude.  creepy, man.
- What?  called.
- So...
EDWARD: Edible art?
Bella.
Thanks.
You know, your mood swings
are kind of giving me whiplash.
I only said  be better
if we  friends,
not that I  wanna be.
What does that mean?
It means if you were smart,
stay away from me.
Okay, well,  sake
that  not smart.
- Would you tell me the truth?
- No, probably not.
rather hear your theories.
I have considered
radioactive spiders and Kryptonite.
all superhero stuff, right?
What if  not the hero?
What if  the bad guy?
You're not.
I can see what you're trying to put off,
but I can see that  just
to keep people away from you.
a mask.
Why  we just hang out?
going to the beach.
Come.
I mean, have fun.
- Which beach?
- La Push.
I  know.
I just...
Is there something wrong with that beach?
just a little crowded.
- Hey,  freezing.
-  paddling out, Coates.
- I  worth it anymore.
- We drove all the way out here.
- JESSICA:  at least paddling out.
- Yeah.
-  right.
- You guys are babies.
So, I keep thinking that
gonna ask me to the prom,
and then he just doesn't.
You should ask him.
Take control.
You're a strong, independent woman.
- I am?
- Yes.
- Hey, will you do me up?
- Yeah.
- Bella!
- Hi, Jacob.
- Guys, this is Jacob.
- Hey, guys. How you doing?
- Hi.
- Hi.
What are you, like, stalking me?
You're on my rez, remember?
Are you surfing?
- Definitely not.
- Thanks.
You guys should keep Bella company.
Her date bailed.
What date?
She invited Edward.
- To be polite,  it.
- I think  nice she invited him.
- Nobody ever does.
- Yeah, 'cause  a freak.
You got that right.
You guys know him?
The Cullens  come here.
What did your friends mean about,
you know, "The Cullens
You caught that, huh?
not really supposed
to say anything about it.
Hey, I can keep a secret.
Really,  just like an old scary story.
Well, I want to know.
Okay, did you know Quileutes
are supposedly descended from wolves?
What? Like, wolves?
- Yeah.
- Like, real wolves?
So  the story about the Cullens?
Well, they're supposedly descended
from this, like, enemy clan.
But they claimed to be something different,
If they promised to stay off Quileute lands,
then we  expose
what they really were to the palefaces.
I thought they just moved here.
Or just moved back.
Right.
ANGELA:  It touched my hand.
A snake! Stop!
Well, what are they really?
just a story, Bella.
Come on,  go.
A snake! A snake!
Hello?
Gerald?
Gerald?
Hello.
Nice jacket.
Who are you?
always the same inane questions.
James,  not play with our food.
JESSICA:  not here.
Whenever the  nice,
the Cullens disappear.
What, do they just ditch?
No, Dr. And Mrs. Cullen yank them out
for, like, hiking and camping and stuff.
I tried that out on my parents.
Not even close.
Guys,  going to the prom with Eric.
- I just asked him. I took control.
- I told you that would happen.
Are you sure you have to go out of town?
Oh, yeah,  a little family thing.
Okay, we should go shopping
in Port Angeles
before all the good dresses get cleaned out.
Port Angeles? You mind if I come?
Yeah, I need your opinion.
- I like this one.
- ANGELA:  cool.
But, like, I  know about
the one-shoulder thing.
- I like this one.
- JESSICA: Yeah, I like the beading,
- and you  need jewelry.
- Jess, what do you think? Lavender?
- Is that good? Is that my color?
- I like it.
I liked that dusty rose one, too.
Okay, I like this one.
It makes my boobs look good.
- Hey.
- JESSICA: Right?
Nice.
- ANGELA: Oh, God.
- That is uncomfortable.
disgusting.
Bella, what do you think?
Yes?
That looks great.
You said that about, like,
the last five dresses, though.
I thought they were all pretty good.
You're not really into this, are you?
I actually really just want
to go to this bookstore.
I'll meet you guys at the restaurant?
- JESSICA: Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah. I'll see you in a minute.
- Okay.
- Okay.
right, though. This looks awesome.
MAN: There you go.
- Have a good night.
- BELLA: Thank you.
- BOY: Saw you in the dress store.
- Hey, where you running to?
BOY: There she is.
-  up?
-  my girl.
- BOY 2: How you guys doing?
- Look who we just found.
up, girl? Hey... Where you going?
- BOY 3: Where are you going?
- Come get a drink with us.
- Yeah, you should hang out with us.
- Come on.
fun.
-  the problem?
- She  like that, man.
- You're pretty.
-  touch me.
- BOY: Cute.
- Really, no. Seriously, you should.
touch me.
Get in the car.
That was a very dangerous maneuver.
I should go back there
and rip those  heads off.
No, you shouldn't.
You  know the vile, repulsive things
they were thinking.
And you do?
not hard to guess.
Can you talk about something else?
Distract me so I  turn around.
You should put your seatbelt on.
You should put your seatbelt on.
- I thought the salad was pretty good.
- Hey, you guys,  sorry. I just...
Where were you? We left you messages.
Yeah, we waited, but we were, like,
starving, so we...
sorry I kept Bella from dinner.
We just sort of ran into each other
and got talking.
- Yeah.
- No.
No, we totally understand.
I mean, that happens, right?
Yeah, we were...
- We were, yeah, we were just leaving. So...
-  get this...
Bella, if you wanna...
I think I should make sure
Bella gets something to eat.
If  like.
I'll drive you home myself.
so thoughtful.
really thoughtful. Yeah.
Yeah. I should eat something.
Yeah.
- Okay, so we'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay, yeah.
- ANGELA: See ya.
- Okay.
All right, one mushroom ravioli.
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.
So are you sure there  anything
I can get for you?
No. No, thank you.
Let me know.
You're really not gonna eat?
No,  on a special diet.
You gotta give me some answers.
Yes, no.
To get to the other side.
I  want to know
what the square root of pi is.
You knew that?
How did you know where I was?
I didn't.
- All right.
- What?
leave. I...
Did you follow me?
I...
I feel very protective of you.
So you followed me.
I was trying to keep a distance
unless you needed my help,
and then I heard what those low-lifes
were thinking.
Wait.
You say you heard what they were thinking?
So what, you...
You read minds?
I can read every mind in this room.
Apart from yours.
money, sex,
money,
sex,
cat.
And then you, nothing.
very frustrating.
Is there something wrong with me?
See, I tell you I can read minds,
and you think
something wrong with you.
What is it?
I  have the strength
to stay away from you anymore.
Then don't.
Okay, I think  warm enough now.
Your hand is so cold.
BELLA: Whoa!
What is going on?
My  still here.
Can you pull in?
EDWARD:  car on the end.
What is he doing here?
EDWARD: Carlisle,  going on?
Waylon Forge was found in a boat
out near his place.
- I just examined the body.
- He died?
- How?
- Animal attack.
Was it the same one that
got that security guard down in Mason?
Most likely.
- Well,  getting closer to town, then.
- Bella, you should go inside.
Waylon was your  friend.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Dad,  really sorry.
I've known him going on 30 years.
worry, we're gonna find this thing.
Meantime,
I want you to carry this with you.
- I  know if you...
- It'll give your old man some peace of mind.
Okay.
go home.
Cold One.
You're impossibly fast and strong.
Your skin is pale white and ice-cold.
Your eyes change color.
And sometimes you speak
like you're from a different time.
You never eat or drink anything.
You  go out in the sunlight.
How old are you?
Seventeen.
How long have you been 17?
A while.
I know what you are.
Say it.
Out loud.
Say it.
Vampire.
Are you afraid?
No.
Then ask me the most basic question.
What do we eat?
You  hurt me.
Where are we going?
Up the mountain.
Out of the cloud bank.
You need to see what
I look like in the sunlight.
This is why we  show
ourselves in sunlight.
People would know we're different.
This is what I am.
like diamonds.
You're beautiful.
Beautiful?
This is the skin of a killer, Bella.
a killer.
I  believe that.
because you believe the lie.
camouflage.
most dangerous predator.
Everything about me invites you in,
my voice, my face, even my smell.
As if I would need any of that.
As if you could outrun me!
As if you could fight me off.
designed to kill.
I  care.
I've killed people before.
It does not matter.
I wanted to kill you.
I've never wanted a  blood
so much in my life.
I trust you.
Don't.
here. I trust you.
My family,
we're different from others of our kind.
We only hunt animals.
We've learned to control our thirst.
But  you, your scent,
like a drug to me.
You're like
my own personal brand of heroin.
Why did you hate me
so much when we met?
I did.
Only for making me want you so badly.
I still  know if I can control myself.
I know you can.
I  read your mind.
You have to tell me what you're thinking.
Now  afraid.
Good.
not afraid of you.
only afraid of losing you.
I feel like you're gonna disappear.
You  know how long
I've waited for you.
So the lion fell in love with the lamb.
What a stupid lamb.
What a sick, masochistic lion.
JESSICA: Monte Carlo?
our prom theme?
Gambling, tuxedos, and Bond, James Bond.
Oh, my God.
Wow.
You know,  staring.
Not that guy. No, he just looked.
breaking all the rules now anyway.
Since  going to hell.
So, does a person have to be dying
to become like you?
No,  just Carlisle.
never do this to someone
who had another choice.
So, how long have you been like this?
Since 1918.
But  he just have to bite?
Not exactly.
When we taste
human blood, a sort of frenzy begins,
and  almost impossible to stop.
So is Carlisle the real reason
that you  kill people?
No,  not the only reason.
I  want to be a monster.
My family,
we think of ourselves as vegetarians, right,
'cause we only survive
on the blood of animals.
But it's...
like a human only living on tofu.
It keeps you strong,
but you're never fully satisfied.
It  be like drinking your blood,
for instance.
Was it other vampires that killed Waylon?
Yeah.
There are others out there,
and we run into them from time to time.
Can the rest of your family
read  minds like you can?
No.  just me.
But Alice can see the future.
I bet she saw me coming.
visions are subjective.
I mean, the future can always change.
Could you act human?
I mean, I've got neighbors.
gonna take you to my place tomorrow.
Thanks.
- Wait, like, with your family?
- Yeah.
What if they  like me?
So, you're worried not because
you'll be in a house full of vampires,
but because you think
they  approve of you?
glad I amuse you.
What is it?
Complication.
I'll pick you up tomorrow.
Hey. Come to visit your truck?
Looks good. Got that dent out.
- Yeah.
- Actually, we came to visit your flat-screen.
First Mariners game of the season.
Plus Jacob here keeps bugging me about
seeing you again.
Great, Dad. Thanks.
Just keeping it real, son.
CHARLIE: Vitamin R.
Well done, Chief.
Harry  homemade fish fry.
Good man.
Any luck with that Waylon case?
Well, I  think it was an animal
that killed him.
Never thought it was.
So spread the word out at the rez, huh?
Keep the kids out of the woods.
Will do.
want no one else getting hurt, do we?
Whoa.
This is incredible.
so light and open, you know?
What did you expect,
coffins and dungeons and moats?
No, not the moats.
Not the moats.
This is the one place we  have to hide.
I told them not to do this.
- Is she even Italian?
- Her name is Bella.
sure she'll love it, no matter what.
ROSALIE:  Get a whiff of that.
Here comes the human.
Bella, we're making Italiano for you.
Bella, this is Esme.
My mother for all intents and purposes.
You've given us an excuse
to use the kitchen for the first time.
I hope you're hungry.
- Yeah, absolutely.
- She already ate.
Perfect.
Yeah,  just because
I know that you guys  eat...
Of course.  very considerate of you.
- Just ignore Rosalie. I do.
- ROSALIE: Yeah.
just keep pretending
like this  dangerous for all of us.
I would never tell anybody anything.
She knows that.
Yeah, well, the problem is,
you two have gone public now, so...
Emmett.
No, she should know.
The entire family
will be implicated if this ends badly.
Badly, as in...
I would become the meal.
Hi, Bella.
Alice.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You do smell good.
Alice, what are you...

Bella and I are gonna be great friends.
CARLISLE: Sorry,

All right,  gonna take you
on a tour of the rest of the house.
- Okay.
- Well, I'll see you soon.
Okay.
- Cute!
- I know.
I think that went well.
Clean this up. Now.
Was that as weird for you as it was for me?
I  know.
Graduation caps?
Yeah.  a private joke.
We matriculate a lot.
kind of miserable.
I mean, repeating high school
over and over.
True, but the younger we start out
in a new place,
the longer we can stay there.
Come on.
Yeah, this is my room.
No bed?
No, I don't...
I  sleep.
- Ever?
- No, not at all.
Okay.
Boy, you have so much music.
What are you listening to?
Debussy.
- I  know...
- Yeah.
is great.
- What?
- I  dance.
Well, I could always make you.
not scared of you.
Well, you really  have said that.
You better hold on tight, spider monkey.
Do you trust me?
In theory.
Then close your eyes.
What?
This  real.
This kind of stuff just  exist.
It does in my world.
MAN: Hold up.
human.
Arizona. Yo,  happening?
So you and Cullen, huh?
That's... I  like it.
I mean, I  know,
he just looks at you
like you're something to eat.
your veggie plate, Stephenie.
Hey, sorry  late. Biology project.
I ordered you the spinach salad.
I hope  okay.
You should order one for yourself next time.
Cut back on the steak.
Hey,  as healthy as a horse.
Say, Chief, boys want to know,
did you find anything
down by Queets River today?
Yeah, we found a bare human footprint,
but it looks like whoever that is,
is headed east,
so Kitsap County sheriff is gonna take
over from here.
- CORA: Okay.
- Okay?
I just hope they catch him fast.
Looks like your friends are flagging you.
okay if you wanna go join them.
just gonna turn in early anyway.
Me, too.
Bella,  Friday night. Go out.
Looks like the Newton
got a big smile for you.
Yeah,  a good buddy.
What about any of these
other yahoos in town?
Anybody interest you?
Dad, we gonna talk about boys?
Yeah, I guess not.
I just feel like I leave you alone too much.
You should be around people.
I  really mind being alone.
I guess  kind of like my dad in that way.
So,  all the baseball stuff going?
working so hard.
You know, spring training.
We're looking for a house to rent
in case things become more permanent.
Yeah?
really liking Forks.
What?
Forks is growing on me.
Could a guy have anything to do with that?
Well, yeah.
I knew it. Tell me everything.
What is he? Jock? Indie?
Mom, can I talk to you later?
Come on, we gotta talk boys.
Are you being safe?
How did you get in here?
The window.
Do you do that a lot?
Well, just the past couple of months.
I like watching you sleep.
kind of fascinating to me.
I always want to try one thing.
Just stay very still.
move.
Stop it!
sorry.
stronger than I thought.
Yeah. I wish I could say the same.
I  ever lose control with you.
Hey,  go.
- Hey, got you another one.
- Thanks.
I have a date with Edward Cullen.
he?
No.
a junior.
I thought you liked the Cullens.
I thought you  like
any of the boys in town.
Edward  live in town.
Technically.
right outside.
He is?
Yeah, he wanted to meet you, officially.
All right. Bring him in.
Could you be nice?
important.
Chief Swan.
I want to formally introduce myself.
Edward Cullen.
Hi, Edward.
Bella  be out too late tonight.
just gonna play baseball
with my family.
Baseball?
Yes, sir,  the plan.
gonna play baseball.
Well, good luck with that.
I'll take good care of her. I promise.
Hey.
Still got that pepper spray?
Yeah, Dad.
And since when do vampires like baseball?
Well,  the American pastime,
and  a thunderstorm coming.
the only time we can play.
You'll see why.
Hey.
Glad you're here. We need an umpire.
She thinks we cheat.
I know you cheat.
- Call them as you see them, Bella.
- Okay.
time.
Okay, now I see why you need the thunder.
gotta be a home run, right?
very fast.
Come home, Rosalie!
- You're out.
- Out!
Babe, come on.  just a game.
Nice kitty.
What are you doing?
My monkey man.
Stop!
They were leaving. Then they heard us.
-  go.
-  too late.
Get your hair down.
Like that'll help.
I can smell her from across the field.
I  have brought you here.
so sorry.
- What? What are you...
- Just be quiet and stand behind me.
I believe this belongs to you.
Thank you.
I am Laurent.
And this is Victoria
and James.
Carlisle. This is my family.
Hello.
afraid your hunting activities
have caused something of a mess for us.
Our apologies.
We  realize the territory
had been claimed.
Yes, well, we maintain
a permanent residence nearby.
Really?
Well, we  be a problem anymore.
We were just passing through.
The humans were tracking us,
but we led them east.
You should be safe.
Excellent.
So,
could you use three more players?
Come on. Just one game.
Sure. Why not?
A few of us were leaving.
You could take their place.
We'll bat first.
the one with the wicked curveball.
Well, I think we can handle that.
We shall see.
You brought a snack.
LAURENT: A human?
CARLISLE: The girl is with us.
I think it best if you leave.
I can see the game is over.
We'll go now.
James.
CARLISLE: Get Bella out of here.
Go.
Okay, I've got it! I've got it!  all right!
What, now  coming after me?
Listen to me. James is a tracker.
The hunt is his obsession.
I read his mind.
My reaction on the field set him off.
I just made this his most exciting game ever.
-  never gonna stop.
- What should we do?
We have to kill him.
Rip him apart and burn the pieces.
- Where we going?
- Away from Forks.
- We'll get a ferry to Vancouver.
- I have to go home. Now.
- You have to take me home.
- You  go home.
just gonna trace your scent there.
gonna look.
- But my dad is there. We...
- It  matter!
Yes, it does!
He could get killed because of us!
Just let me get you out of here first,
all right?
my dad! We have to go back!
We'll figure a way
to lead the tracker away somehow.
I  know. But we have to do something.
- Edward, I said leave me alone.
- Bella,  do this, please.
over! Get out!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Bella?  going on?
I just gotta get out of here.  leaving now.
Hey.
CHARLIE: Bella?
What am I gonna say to him?
I  hurt him.
- Bella,  going on?
- You just have to.
I'll be down at the truck.
Did he hurt you?
No.
Break up with you or something?
No, I broke up with him.
I thought you liked him.
Yeah,  why I have to leave.
I  want this. I have to go home.
Home? Your...
CHARLIE: Your  not even in Phoenix.
BELLA: She'll come home.
I'll call her from the road.
You're not gonna drive home right now.
You can sleep on it.
If you still feel like going in the morning,
- I'll take you to the airport.
- No. I want to drive.
It'll give me more time to think.
I mean, if I get really tired,
I'll pull into a motel. I promise.
Look, Bella, I know  not
that much fun to be around,
but I can change that.
We can do more stuff together.
Like what?
Like watch baseball on the flat-screen?
Eat at the diner every night?
Steak and cobbler?
Dad,  not me.
Bella, come on, I just...
I just got you back.
Yeah, and, you know, if I  get out now,
then  just gonna be stuck here like Mom.
Your  gonna forgive you.
Why  you let me drive?
He won't.
You should've seen his face.
I told him the same thing
that my mom told him
when she was leaving him.
let you go.
Just  worry about him now.
following us.
- Oh, God.
-  just Emmett.
Alice is in the car behind us.
CARLISLE: Wait.
He came to warn us about James.
This  my fight,
and I've grown tired of his games,
but  got unparalleled senses,
absolutely lethal.
I've never seen anything like him
in my 300 years.
And the woman, Victoria,
underestimate her.
I've had to fight our kind before.
- They're not easy to kill.
- EMMETT: But not impossible.
We'll tear them apart and burn the pieces.
I  relish the thought
of killing another creature,
even a sadistic one like James.
- What if he kills one of us first?
-  gonna run Bella south.
Can you lead the tracker away from here?
No, Edward.
James knows you would never leave Bella.
- He'll follow you.
- ALICE: I'll go with Bella.
Jasper and I will drive her south.
I'll keep her safe, Edward.
- Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?
- Yes.
Rosalie, Esme,
could you put these on
so the tracker will pick up  scent?
Why? What is she to me?
Rosalie, Bella is with Edward.
part of this family now,
and we protect our family.
Oh, God. If anything...
What if...
If anything happens, I swear to God...
gonna happen.
seven of us,
and  two of them,
and when  done,
gonna come back and get you.
Yeah.
Bella, you are my life now.
Hey, Mom.  me again.
You must have let your phone die
or something.
okay,
and I'll explain it later.
EDWARD: Rosalie, mark the tree.
good.
What is it? What do you see?
figured it out.
The tracker, he just changed course.
- Where will it take him, Alice?
- Mirrors.
A room full of mirrors.
Edward said the visions
always certain.
JASPER: She sees the course people
are on while they're on it.
If they change their minds,
the vision changes.
Okay, so the course that
the  on now
is gonna lead him to a ballet studio?
- You've been here?
- I took lessons as a kid.
The school I went to
had an arch just like that.
Was your school here in Phoenix?
Yeah.
- Edward, are you okay?
- We've lost the tracker.
The  still in the area.
Rosalie and Esme are going back
to Forks to protect your father.
coming to get you. Then you and I
are gonna go somewhere alone.
I'll do whatever it takes
to make you safe again.
Hey, Mom,  glad you got my message.
What are you doing home?
- Calm down,  fine.
I'll explain everything later.
Mom, are you there?
It was just too easy for Victoria
to find your previous address.
touch her! Don't...
- You can still save her.
- Where should I meet you?
How about your old ballet studio?
RENEE: Bella? Bella? Bella, where are you?
- Mom?
- Bella?
- Mom?
- There you are.
my favorite part.
You were a stubborn child,  you?
-  not even here.
- No.
JAMES: Sorry.
You know, but you really made it too easy.
So to make things more entertaining,
gonna make a little film
of our time together.
I borrowed this from your house.
I hope you  mind.
Good.
And
action.
That'll break  little heart.
You have...
Edward has nothing to do with this!
But he does.
His rage will make for more interesting sport
than his feeble attempt to protect you.
And  continue.
Beautiful. Very visually dynamic.
I chose my stage well.
have
the strength to turn you.
Instead, he kept you
this fragile little human.
cruel, really.
Tell Edward how much it hurts.
Tell him to avenge you. Tell him!
- No, Edward, don't!
- Tell him! Tell him!
You're alone
'cause you're faster than the others.
But not stronger.
strong enough to kill you.
sorry.
Bella, Bella,  okay.
Son. Enough.
Remember who you are.
ALICE: Bella, you're okay.
Bella needs you.
okay.
Oh, God.
Carlisle? Her blood.
- Your brothers will take care of him.
- I got him.
- ALICE: Carlisle!
- Start the fire.
EMMETT: Get the floorboards.
- JASPER: Alice!
- Alice, go.
Her femoral  been severed.
losing too much blood.
No, no, my head is burning!
the venom.
You have to make a choice.
You could let the change happen.
No.
No.
-  gonna happen, Edward. I've seen it.
- It  have to be that way.
still hemorrhaging.
Alice, make me a tourniquet. Your belt.
Carlisle,  my other option?
Tie it above my hands.
Carlisle!
Go.
- We could try to suck the venom out.
- You know I  be able to stop.
Then find the will to stop.
But choose.
She only has minutes left.
gonna make it go away, Bella.
gonna make it go away.
Edward, stop.
Her blood is clean. You're killing her.
Edward.
Stop.
Stop.
Find the will.
Bella?
Baby?
Bella.
- Mom?
- Hey.
Where is he?
Where's...
Edward?
asleep.
He never leaves.
And your dad,  down at the cafeteria.
What happened?
Well, when you fell, you broke your leg,
and you lost a lot of blood.
You  remember any of this, do you?
Edward came down with his dad
to try to convince you
to come back to Forks.
So you went over to their hotel,
then you tripped,
and you fell down two flights of stairs.
Went through a window.
Yeah, that sounds like me.
Oh, honey,  so sorry.
Phil.
so worried about you.
You're texting.
Finally, yeah.
I told him to stay down in Florida.
Honey, you are gonna love Jacksonville.
sunny every day,
and we found the cutest little house,
and you've got your own bathroom.
Mom, I still want to live in Forks.
What?
I want to live in Forks.
Well, okay, but we'll talk about it.
Do you mind getting Dad?
I have to talk to him. Apologize.
Okay, baby. I'll go get him.
- And I'll go get a nurse, okay?
- Okay.
So what happened?
James?
We took care of it.
And the woman, Victoria, she ran off.
alive because of you.
No, you're in here because of me.
The worst part of it was that
I thought I  gonna be able to stop.
You did stop.
Bella, you gotta go to Jacksonville
so I  hurt you anymore.
What?
Are you... No!
No!
I  even know what you're... How...
What are you talking about?
You want me to go away? I can't...
No, I can't... I  just leave you...
I know.
We  be apart.
You  leave me.
here.
Okay, just don't...
You just  say stuff like that to me. Ever.
Where else am I gonna go?
Alice lent me the dress.
The cast is...
You're perfect.
I'll take care of her, Chief Swan.
I've heard that before.
All right, Bells.
I put a new can of pepper spray in your bag.
Dad.
And...
Well, you look beautiful.
Thanks.
See you.
Hey. I'll be right back.
- Bella.
- Jacob.
Hey.
- Nice.
- You, too.
Are you crashing the prom or something?
Did you come with a date?
No.
My dad paid me to come talk to you.
Twenty bucks.
hear it.
Just  get mad, okay?
He wants you to break up
with your boyfriend.
just, he said, quote,
- Okay, well, tell him, "Thanks."
- Okay.
- And to pay up.
- Okay. Let me help you.
Jacob.
I'll take it from here.
Guess I'll see you around, Bella.
All right.
I leave you alone for two minutes,
and the wolves descend.
- I  believe you're making me do this.
- Just smile.
Wow. You are really trying to kill me.
The prom is an important rite of passage.
I  want you to miss anything.
Oh.
Bella, hey!
- Do you want to go?
- Yeah.
DJ: All right, slowing it down.
Shall we?
You're serious?
Why not.
See, you're dancing.
At prom.
Edward, why did you save me?
If you just let the venom spread,
I could be like you by now.
You  know what you're saying.
- You  want this.
- I want you.
Always.
not gonna end your life for you.
dying already.
Every second, I get closer.
Older.
supposed to be.
Alice said that she saw me like you.
- I heard her.
- Her visions change.
Yeah, based on what people decide.
I've decided.
So  what you dream about.
Becoming a monster.
I dream about being with you forever.
Forever?
And you're ready right now?
Yes.
Is it not enough
just to have a long and happy life with me?
Yeah.
For now.
