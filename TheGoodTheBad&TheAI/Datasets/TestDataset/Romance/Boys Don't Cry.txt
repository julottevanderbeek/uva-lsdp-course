I hate it, though.
I'm thinking of changing it.
Sometimes that helps.
I'm Brandon.
I'll pay if you get 'em.

#Is a new shade ofr blue ##
Check this out.
- My friend's sitting there.
- So?
I said get off.
Excuse me. Why don't you leave the lady

You've gotta be kidding me.
I didn't ask you

You frucker!
You motherfrucker!

Go, John, go!
Go, John. Go, John, go.

- I am?
- Yeah.
Oh, shit!
- You got a light, man?
- Oh, yeah, here.
Mmm.
- You have got the tiniest hands. Yeah.
- No.
They're big!
Joe Louis had tiny hands.
So? He didn't throw
wild punches without defrense.
If you're gonna get into fights
over girls like Candace,
you've gotta learn a few moves.
- Come on.
- Come on.
- Hey, pussy!
- Fuck you, man!
- Tom, this is Brandon.
- Hi.
John. We'll give you a ride home
as soon as we find the goddamn car!
Sorry. It's up here somewhere.
We're goir to a party. Wanna come?
Candace.
- It's 70 miles away.
- I don't care. The night is young.
And I am a mess, so...
-
- John.
Good.
Are we there yet?
Just up ahead, unless you wanna stop at
a roadhouse and get into another fight.
I don't know where
the fuck I am.
Falls City?
What are you doir down there?
That's not even on the map.
Oh, fuck.
Lonny, my life is a fuckir nightmare.
I got this big court date next week,
and I don't got anywhere to stay.
If I don't make it,
I'm fucked. Can I stay at your house?
- What about those doctors?
- I went.
That shit's insane! You gotta see
shrinks, shoot hormones up your butt.
It costs a fuckir fortune.
I'm gonna be an old man
by the time I get that kind of money.
Do something. You can't
just keep running because...
you're gonna end up in jail.
Forever.
- You really think I can do it?
- You're the butch.
Come straight to my house.
No stopping in bars,
no stealing and no more girls.
No more girls.
No more girls.
- Hey, handsome. Sleep all right?

Wow. Beautiful.
You still brooding

Wow.
Cool.
You suck.
Ah, hey, champ!

Tom only dates girls that got

You know what I mean?
That's how he picks 'em.
Tom likes 'em coyote ugly.
You know coyote ugly?
I'm all over some booty.
Thank you.
Looks like you're ridir home

Shut up, John!
He looks fine, right?
- Just like family.
-  Speaking ofr.

but she wandered off.
You got some time

Lfr these girls get their shit together,

Where you been?
Come on, Lana. Let's go on, already.
It was your idea.
Who are you?
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
# The lonesome Texas sun
was setting slow #
#And in the rearview mirror
I watched it go #
-
- Shut the fuck up!
- #In her golden hair #
-
# I close my eyes for a moment #
# I'm still there #
#The bluest eyes in Texas #
#Are haunting me tonight #
#Another town #
#Another hotel room #
#Another dream
that ended way too soon #
# Left me lonely #
#Praying fror the dawn #
# Searching for the strength
to carry on #
#The bluest eyes in Texas #
#Are haunting me tonight ##
-  Come on.
-  Whoo!
What the fuckir fuck? I thought
you were gonna be like five minutes!
We got stuck...
- in time warp.
- Get in the car already.
Hey, Brandon.
- Come with us.
- He's a psycho-killer anyway.
Crash with me again.
Come on, buddy.
Whoo-hoo!
Like I was saying,
when I get to the house,
my sister was totally naked
and totally on fire, right?
Oh, yeah. Tom was like
"Where's my camera?" Right?
You saved everyone?
Oh, yeah. Tom's a big hero.
He rescued everybody. Right, dickwad?
Yeah, so when they brought me in,
they were like,
"This is the biggest fire we seen here
in 50 years. You're a hero, man."
I was like, "Yeah?"
They were like, "Yeah."
That's why they put me in
all of'em Lincoln newspapers.
- Probably seen 'em. That was me.
-  That's cool.
-  What the hell is that?
-  Bumper skiing.
Thank you.
Flippirburgers.
That's for squares, man. I mean, give me
real work like in the oil fields.
I was thinkir about becoming a
smoke jumper out in Mount Saint Helens.
Fightir fires,
makir lots of money.
- Then traveling all around.
Memphis, Graceland, Tennessee.
-  You dick.
- Graceland is in Memphis.
And Memphis is in Tennessee.
-
I know.
- Maybe you've had enough.
- I ain't had any.
No shit, man.
People like you don't need drugs.
You just hallucinate
- Oh, shit!
-
All right, Tom, you're up.
Not me, man.
I'm drinking.
All right, Brandon,
that means you. Come on.
- Yeah, stud. Let's go, cowboy.
- Come on, you can do it.
Come on. Come on.
This here's Brandon.
A mean prizefighter from Lincoln,
so be careful what you say to him.
Very tough.
Don't let 'em scare you.
You can do it.
- He is a freak.
-
- Come on!
-
You can do better than that!
- One more time. One more time.
- John, come on. Stop it, John.
- Oh, okay, okay.
- Stop it!
-
- Ow!
-  Take it easy.
-  No, I'm fne.
- Yeah, you're fne.
- I'm fne!
- Bring that truck back around!
- You're a crazy fucker.
What are we gonna do with you?
- Man, it's nothing.
- Yeah, it's nothing.
Wait, where are you going?
I'll drive!
You don't have a car.
# There's a diamond in her eye #
#It's a-shining up above #
#And the moon in the sky #
#Say you won't tell why #
# We're gamblers that tell you lies #
#Should take a tumble and never lose #

Oh, hey.
Ah, you sell...
Ruffles?
Ruffles.
Right over there.
Thank you.
Dream on, Lana.
- I can't be selling you no beer tonight.
- Fine, I'll browse.
The beer's in the back
if you want it.
Oh.
- Hey.
- Space cowboy.
I'm so wasted. I don't know
if I'm ever gonna come down.
- That's okay.
- I need beer.
Come here.
Shh. Come here.
It's okay. It's okay.
Stay right here.
It's okay.
Here, um... it's for me.
- Can I see some I.D.?
- Sure.
Oh, look how beautiful.
Jesus Christ! I feel like I'm on acid.
It's like an album cover.
You care to join me?
- Come on.
- Fuck off!
- Hey, hey.
- Don't talk to me like that,
you skanky little snake!
Kwik Stop.
Hey, Lana!
Lana, wait.
- I'll drive you. I got Candace's car.
- I'm walkir.
Here.
What are you still hanging
around here for anyway?
I thought someone ought to walk you home
before you get an M.I.P. Or somethir.
I don't need anybody
to walk me anywhere.
- Jeez, watch it.
- I don't need you
to stop me from trippir.
Lana, you are
one cranky girl.
You'd be cranky too, " Mr. I'm Going
To Memphis-Graceland-Tennessee,"
if you were stuck in a town
where there's nothing to do but
bumper skiing and chase bats...
every night of your evil fucking life.
I been bored my whole life.
Yeah? Is that why you letJohn tie you
up to the truck and drag you like a dog?
No. I just thought
that's what guys do around here.
Wait a minute.
What's your name again?
Brandon.
The disks took off from here.
That's all there is. Let's go back.
Lana?
Lana?
Just go on home, okay?
God, I hate my life.
Lana!
I hate your life too.
Don't look at my stupid house.
I'm not looking at your stupid house.
I'm looking at you.
What was I thinking?
Mom?
Come on.
- Come on.

- Uh-uh.
- Upsy. Oh.

Don't.
It's okay.
Hi. Here, drink this.
You'll feel better in the morning.
Come on.
Oh, here.
Yuck.

My dad taught it to me.
You're not gonna sing

No.
I can't sing to save my life.
- Me neither.
- What?
Sure you can.
You sing great.
That wasrt me.
It was karaoke.
So? You were still great.
I couldn't do it.
A lot ofr people I know couldn't.
You don't know any songs
about cows.
Sure, I do.

Wow.
Thank you.
My hand sucks.

This here's my real family,
even if it isn't my real home. You know?
I mean, uh...
Lana...
I don't know.
It's kinda hard to explain.
Well, I got 12 more
like this at home.
I keep it in a secret place.
She wrote to me
when I was in lockup.
Lana did?
Yep. She wrote to me. Even my own mom
didn't write to me, but she did.
Lana and her mom.
They took me in.
Fuck.
Fucker.

- I'm frrom Lincoln.
But my dad's out in...

And my mom's in Hollywood.

Brandon, while you're up, why don't you

- Fuck you.
- Just playir with you, bud.
Brandon, come here.
Over here.
Closer where I can see you. Let me

Come here. Let me.
I can believe you got a model

Hey, April?
- Want a beer?
- Hey!
What the fuck

Here you go, hon.
Have some of Dad's.
Come on. Come on.
Little bit.
Four years ago, you wouldn't

Shit, frour years ago you wouldn't
have been able to talk to him.
Prison. Mm-hmm.
And her mother!
Jesus Christ!
And this one, this one
kept that boy's spirit alive.
Would you just forget
about that?
The bastard pissed on me!
This never would've happened
ifr she had the proper training.
- Your mother's an asshole!
- John, she had an accident.
It's okay, sweetie.
It's not your frault.
Having fun?
Yeah.
What do you think of my mom?
She's pretty weird, huh?
No, I like her.
You know, I think she's funny.
Are you for real?
Excuse me.
Am I interrupting something?
Brandon, I want you to take
a picture of me and my daughter.
Lana's dad gave us that.
I don't feel like having
my picture taken now.
Come on, honey. Just one.
Come on, son.
Hey!
Well, refill time.
Bring it in
when you're ready, okay?
Okay.
Here, look.
It's not bad, huh?
- Oh!

- Why not? You're beautiful.
Come over here.
I had a dream
about you last night.
You did?
What happened?
-  No!
- Come on, tell me the dream.
Someone walked me home
last night.
I think it was you.
No frair!
Lana, time to go to work.
John, you're too fucked up.
Why don't you let Brandon drive?
Hey, here you go,
little buddy.
You all right?
Tom!
Nice car.
Why don't you turn down
your radio?
Yeah, totally!
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- Wall people.
- What the fuck did you say?
- I said, "Wall people."
- Bite me, you fuckir fudgepacker!
- Eat me.
Fuck you!
Go!
Come on, pussy!
Go faster, you cocksucker.
Go, go, go!
Bitches! Bitches!
Whoo!
It's the man!
Fuck!
-  It's the piggers.

He's catching up.
What the fruck?
- Fuck.
- Don't stop, don't stop. Go faster.
Brandon.
Go faster.
- Brandon, stop!
-
They ain't got
no fruckirballs!
When you hit the gravel,
drop to 40.
I can't see.
That's okay.
Neither can he. You're flyir.
Take it out.
Get off me, Dave.
I wasrt doing anything.
Going awful fast back there,
Mr. Brayman.
- Mind telling me what
you're doing in Falls City?
- Just visiting, officer, sir.
Where are you staying?
He's staying with me.
I can't run a check on this, son,
'cause our computers are down.
But I could run you all in right now.
You could let these guys
go, huh, man?
They ain't got anything to do with it.
I got carried away.
We don't got anything
like this in Lincoln.
Dustless highways?
Only one in Nebraska.
That's a 100 foot drop.
- I'm not gonna lock you up,
but you're gettir a ticket.
- Okay.
Those are residential streets
back there, so you slow down.
- Do you read me, Mr. Brayman?
- Absolutely, sir.
Let me see this I.D.
That's pretty slick. Charles Brayman.
I let you down.
I'm sorry.
Man, don't worry about it. We'll take
you down to the tunnel, chase some bats.
Yeah, it's like
the tunnel of love.
God, Candace,
would you get a grip?
- Is that your real birthday?
- No, November 10, '72.
Hey, that's next week.
Let's have a party.
Twenty-one!
You're gonna be a man!
Shit.
Don't you never pull
that shit again.
What?
You heard me. I said
don't never pull that shit again.
You got me stopped
by the fuckir cops.
Why, but you're the one
who told me to race after 'em.
I had you in the clear
and you frucked up.
John, it's over.
Don't get upset.
I'm not upset.
You almost got us killed.
I almost got us killed?
Whoo.
Brandon.
You're the one who led us
then shut your eyes when we were
about to go off some 400 froot ravine.
Fuck!
Get out of my goddamn car!
Get out of my motherfucking car!
Get out of my goddamn,
motherfucking, shit-eating car!
Get out ofr my goddamn,
motherfruckin; shit-eating car!
- Not you!
- Fuck you!
No, not you.
-
- Welcome to the psycho ward.
Come on, Kate.
He's taking us to work.
You know,
Tom set that fire hisself.
That's my car!
Doctors say he ain't got
no impulse control.
I'm the only one
who can control that fucker.
Come on.
We'll walk you home, Candace.
You ever try this?
Tom.
Did you set
your own framily's house on fre?
What about this?
You ever do this?
What the fuck, Tom?
Some people punch holes in walls.
This helps snap me back
into reality.
Gets a control ofr this thing
inside ofr me so I don't,
you know, lash out at someone.
Me and John used to do it to ourselves
all the time in lockup.
I could always
go deeper than him.
He's such a wuss.
Try it.
God, I guess I am a pussy
compared to you.
I'm just jokir
with you, man.
Fuck.
Fuck!
Brandon. Hey.
Lana.
I'm so sorry.
I just had to see someone nice.
I just got off work
and I'm having a nervous breakdown.
Just a minute.
I have to pee, okay?
God, I was scared to death
that Candace was gonna catch me.
You know she's obsessed
with fnding a husband.
I'm positive
you're her fravorite candidate.
I can't believe you worked last night.
You must be exhausted.
Me, neither. I do it all the time. You
don't have to be sober to weigh spinach.
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Yeah.
I'm crashing really hard, though.
I, um, have to go back to Lincoln
to take care of some stuff.
- You're really leaving?
- Yeah.
Are you gonna see your sister?
The model.
Yeah.
Oh. Nicole. She's pretty.
Is she gonna be there?
Yeah.
Now that she's married,
we're gonna be taking off any second.
So,
where are you going
on your big trip out of here?
Oh, I don't know.
I guess it's not
all worked out yet.
That's okay.
Um,
thanks for giving
your address to the cops.
It was nothing.
I might hitchhike.
Really?
I've never done that.
Me, neither.
Well...
This might sound really stupid,
but do you think there's anywhere
I could make money doing karaoke?
Why not? People make money
doing all sorts of things.
Did you really write letters
to him in prison?
Give me a break.
I was 13 years old.
Who told you that?
My mom?
He did.
You better go.
Yeah, yeah.

Down here.
Brandon.
- Where'd you get that?
- Nice hat.
I gotta go.
My break's almost over.
It looks so different
from the outside.
You're so pretty.
I feel like
I'm in a trance.
Am I goir too fast?
I cannot wear these.
They make me look fat.
Quit changing the subject.
I saved your ass at work.
Tell us what's goir on?
Yeah, I bet Brandon
doesn't think you're frat.
Nobody looks fat
when they're laying down.
I knew it!
I fucking knew it!
We just drove around
taking pictures.
Yeah, right.
Ooh!
I cannot talk about it.
It's too intense.
Come on, Lana.
I can't take it.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

- I mean...
I don't know.
You're so handsome.
And then we took off our clothes
and went swimmir.
Don't be scared, Brandon.

Whoo!
