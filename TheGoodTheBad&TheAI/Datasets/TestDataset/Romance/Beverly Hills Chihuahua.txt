Okay, you can tell me.
That is why the police.

And now here we are,

Well, we better move.
We have to get out of here.
Well ..
Come on. Do not talk.
Thin.
What happened to you?
Why can not smell anything?
Well ...
My partner and I ...
We were on a raid.
I was ahead.
Before I knew,

It was all very fast.
While she was unconscious,
my companion was wounded.
Never came into being
the same after that.
Neither I nor.
Debi have meaning come.
I lifted the following day
and could not smell anything.
Are you injured?
Not ..
They say it's all in my head.
In my head.

Do not be afraid.
Have them!
Chloe runs!
Run and hide!

Aca no!
Say hello to my little friends.
Good time you guys came.

ancestors come from here.
Some took to the civilization ..

Small dogs saved.
Very small dogs.
Tonight we will celebrate his arrival.
Thanks Moctezuma.

But I'm just a puppy.
¿Dog?
No.
Do not insult you.
Do not insult the Chihuahua race.

Fools and handbags use.
