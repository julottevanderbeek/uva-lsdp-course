He'd be wearing
an orange prison suit.
You see anything like that?
Mmm, nope.
Tie up our line
and we'll towyou in.
Finn:
Andthat wasthe endofit.
Perhapsyou've had
an experience like that...
in childhood
and told no one.
Perhapsyou've had that brush
with a world so large...
thatyou seldom or never
saw it again.
J oe: J esus.
It's the land time forgot.
It's Nora Driggers Dinsmoor.
You wait here.
I'm gonna go find out...
whattheywant us to do.
Is it all right
if I take a look around?
No. You stay put
till I come back.
I mean it.
God knowswhat's

Finn:
Nora Driggers Dinsmoor...
the richest ladyin the gulf...
who had lost her mind
when herfiancé left her
standing at the altar.
Girl:
What's your name?
Finn.
Hey, Finn?
Hey!
Come on.
Ha-ha-ha!
Hey, man,

She slipped me $500
underthe door.
Gas money, she called it.
Weirdestthing.
What?
Nothin'.
Can I ridewith you?
Sure.Just don't
sittoo close.
You smell likefertilizer.
Really? I do?
Ha-ha-ha!
Joe: Mag?
Maybeyou've got

You're not gonna believe

Yes, well, he just--
Did he do something bad?
I'll be glad to.
That sounds really--
You got it.
OK. 3:00.
This Saturday?
And thankyou

Babe,you are not gonna believe
where we were today.
Joe, thatwas
Nora Driggers Dinsmoor.
See, I knew itwas
too good to be true.
She want her money back?
She wants him. Finn.
The richest lady
in the whole goddamn state...
calls me on the phone
and wants my little brother...
to go playwith her niece.
Yeah? Why?
Why? She met him.
The old bat liked you.
He's a likable kid.
He's adorable.
Who knows? Who cares?
Joe, this is
a really good thing.
No, no, no. How--
Dinsmoor never even met Finn.
She wouldn't open the door.
She slipped this underneath.
What is it?
What is it,Joe? God!
You like living here?
You like living here
with all the dead people?
What'swrongwith the people
down here all of a sudden?
I'm tired ofworking
so many extra shifts...

Theytook awaythe nets.
I can't change that.
Fuckthe nets,Joe!

It's tragic.
You're already in love with her.
And even though I warn you,

This is a girl's.
Just keep it buttoned,
and no one will notice.
Where'd you getthis?
It's Maggie's.
It's one of
the onlythings she left.
What a bitch.

~Worried mornings

~ And into worried nights ~
~ But it's all right~
~When you're all in pain ~

I don't speak French.
Quel dommage.
~When you're all in pain ~
~ And you feel the rain
come down ~
~ Oh, it's all right~
Estella?
Excuse me.
Haveyou seen Estella?
Finn:
Dinsmoorwas weirderthan usual.
But I had to see Estella.
I never come here.
Never.
You knowwhy?
I trusted.
I saved myself.
I was a virgin.
It's funny, hmm?
Those were the times.
That's how I was raised.
What kind of creature
takes such a thing?
Such a gift? Atrust?
Who does this?
Takes advantage
of a 42-year-old woman?
What kind of creature...
Ieaves this woman
waiting like a fool?
A man. A man does this.
So men must pay.
Am I right?
Estella will make men weep.
Doyou knowwhere she is?
Oh,yes.
She'll breakthem.
I taught herwell.
When she returns...
she'll cutthrough them
like a hot knifethrough butter.
Chicka-boom.
Returns?
Oh, my dear boy...
didn'tyou know?
Estella's left
for school abroad.
Switzerland for 2 years,
then Paris.
She's gone.
Didn't she say good-bye?
Oh, I'm sure she meantto.
Seeyou nextweek, dear.
~~
~You know
you're gonna lie toyou ~
Finn:
Istoppedgoing
to Paradiso Perduto.
I stoppedpainting.
I put aside fantasy
and the wealthy...
and the heavenly girl
who did not want me.
None of it would happen
to me again.
I'd seen through it.
I elected to grow up.

Joe:

This isJerry Ragno.
Jerry-- Mr. Ragno
is a lawyer in Miami.
And NewYork.
We have offices in Manhattan.
So, Finn,
I'm empowered by my client...
to makeyour dreams
come true.
Ha-ha-ha!
Really?
Any particular dream or...
just all ofthem?
Ragno: Haveyou
ever shown yourwork?
Joe:Well, they had
Finn's painting up...
atWashington Federal Bank.
Come on!
Thatwas 7-- 8years ago.
I told you
I gave all that up.
I-- I don't understand what
this is all about, Mr. Ragno.
Howwould you like a show?
A one-man show.
Thrall Gallery.
In NewYork.
Yeah. My client
Erica Thrall...
wants to bringyou
to NewYork.
Why?
For a show in her gallery.
This is bullshit.
Haveyou ever sent slides
ofyourwork...
totheThrall Gallery?
Probably. I sent
slides everywhere...
when I was in high school.
Obviouslytheymade
quite an impression.
A planeticket
to NewYork plus $ 1,000...
for incidentals.
Sorry. They're all in hundreds.
Whoo.
Mmm.
Well...
the hundreds
aren'tthe problem.
I just-- I don't
paint anymore.
Whoa.
~Bésame~
~Bésame~
~Bésame~
Finn:
Whose business was it?
Whose business was it
what I did with mylife?
Who'd gotten
mylife in order? Me.
I was in control.
And everything I wanted,
I had.
~ Bésame ~
Ms. Dinsmoor?
Cocktails ready, Thomas?
Uh, no. It's-- It's me.
It's Finn.
I came--
Looking for Estella.
I know.
That hook is in deep,
isn't it, dear?
Actually, I came
to askyou a question.
I see.
After nearly 10years...
without a word,
without a visit.
Come to interrogate me.
How interesting.
I'm sorry.
Things happened.
I knowwhat happened.
The love ofyour life
leftyou.
Hurts, doesn't it?
Come closer.
I've gone red.
Yeah, I noticed.
It's nice.
And look atyou.
All grown up. A man.
Ms. Dinsmoor, a lawyer
named Ragno came to see me.
Spider.
You know him?
Ragno means "spider"
in Italian.
You must learn
other languages, Finn.
This lawyer Ragno
says he represents...
an art gallery owner
in NewYork...
and theywant
to show mywork.
You can draw.
You can't dance
worth a shit...
butyou can draw.
I wanted to ask. Did you
know anything aboutthis?
Estella's in NewYork.
I doubt our pathswill cross.
Soyou're going?
You think I should?
I rememberwatchingyou
from thatverywindow overthere.
A scared little mouse
scurrying across my garden...
and through myfront door.
Now... another door opens.
Whatwill our mouse do?
I expect an invitation.
I'm sorry?
Toyour opening. Your show.
Ahh.
P.A.: This is
yourfinal boarding call.
What kind of equipment

What?
They gotyou on
a widebody or767?
I have no idea. I just
hope it stays upthere.
Well,you better get on.
Yeah.
What happens if I get
up there and, uh...
I can't--
I can't do it?
Hey, Finn...
nothing harderthan
being given your chance.
At least
that's what I hear.
Sir? Sir?
You can't proceed
without a ticket.
Taxi!
Man:
You fucked a dead man!
You know how I know?
'Cause I'm gonna kill
the motherfucker!
Hold on! Shit! Hold on!
Hey,you got change
for a dollar?
What?
Fuckyou! Fuckyou!
Wait-- Fuckyou, man!
Fuckyou!
Finn:
Well, then, there I was.
Ms. Dinsmoor
as mysecret benefactor...
sent me to New York to draw...
to have the girl...
to have it all...
and I looked out
on the great city...
as so many before
which held it all...
and it was that close...
and it was mine.
Liebchen, gut Morgen.
Are you still
holding the Picasso...
the red and green one?
Good, because I think
I have somebody interested.
No, I can't say right now.
Justthe Picasso.
Fabelhaft. Danke.
Yourwork, darling?
Here's whereyou
show meyourwork.
Right. I told you.
There isn't any.
Then you better get busy.
Belly out.
Why am I here?
You saw some slides?
I gave Keith Haring a show...
after he drew a sketch
in the palm ofmy hand.
Thatworked out.
Butwhich ones?
Which paintings did you like?
The point is I saw
the beginning of something.
And hereyou are.
Annette at Sotheby's.
Whatyou do here
is really uptoyou, isn't it?
Stay and paint, or enjoy
the sights and go home.
Your choice.
Eitherway, I always enjoy
meeting a young painter.
Look, I mean,
I'll do it.
I said that I'll do it.
I'll dothe paintings.
Wonderful. Call Marcy
when you have somethingfor us.
Finn:
Andl couldstill draw.
Nothinghadlessenedit
as much as I hadabusedit...
much as I hadabandoned it.
It was a gift,
and it was still mine.
And everything else
was less real.
What could it mean,
that picture ofthe world?
But when it's true...
we recognize it...
in ourselves, in others.
We recognize it,
like love--
completely undeserved.
You're drooling.
So...
Finn Bell...
in New York.
That's right.
You know,
I thought I sawyou...
Iastwinter around Christmas.
I was driving down Fifth.
Itwas mobbed.
No, itwasn't me.
I just got here.
Well, actually,
nowthat I seeyou...
this guywas...
bigger.
Bigger?
Fatter.
Mm-hmm.
And he had this long hair--
Yeah? You thought
thatwas me?
Well,you know, I hadn't
seen you in years.
It has been a while.
And here we are.
I have to run.
Well, wait, wait,
maybe we could--
Listen, why not
meet me tomorrow...
atthe Borough Club
around 6:00?
I'm meeting some friends
for drinks.
Ifyou're free, that is.
I'm free.
I'm glad you're here.
Man: A long time ago,
there lived 2 brilliant artists--
Geniuses--
Both true geniuses.
And one day, one ofthem
was painting out in the forest--
as artists do--
and he came upon
this little dog...
who was crying and whining
and obviously lost.
Man:
A puppy.
Please. Yes, sure,
a puppy. Fine.
So, um, he couldn't
concentrate anyway...
so he scooped
the puppy up-- puppy--
and he took him
back into town...
to find its rightful owner...
who turned outto be...
the prince
ofthe entire kingdom...
who was eternally grateful...
and verywealthy.
And that artist's name
was...
Michelangelo.
True story.
The other artist's name was--
Nobody knows, because he was
never heard from again.
Woman: Never heard from again.
Right, right.
No, that's so true,Walter.
Is it all right
if I smoke?
Man:We've all heard
your de Kooning stories.
You want one?
Woman:
Oh, really, come on.
It'syour last one.
Oh. Uh--
It's all right.
Uh, so, you're--
Cigarette, please.
You're from Florida, too?
Yeah.
I'm surrounded.
Everybody's from Florida.
I'm notfrom Florida.
I hate Florida.
Too much sun.
- Man: Yeah.
- Really?
Actually,
Finn was my childhood--
Whatwereyou, exactly?
He was my, uh...
first love.
Man:
I thought I was.
Ifthat's whatyou say.
He painted a portrait ofme...
when I was 10years old
thatwas so beautiful.
Woman:
I satfor a portrait once.
Electric experience.
Man: Great. You slept
with de Kooning.
Can we get on
with our lives?
I did not.
I'd like to paintyou again.
Would you?
I wantto paint
your portrait.
What doyou think,
sweetheart?
Me?
Ha-ha.
Um--
Well, gee...
doyou charge bythe inch
or bythe hour?
What?
How doyou priceyour art?
By, like, its size--
like, squarefootage--
or bythe time
ittakes to make...
the art?
I--
I've actually never
sold a painting.
Sir! Excuse me, sir.
Please, sir.
Excuse me, sir.
That's a club jacket
you have on.
This isyourjacket.
Oh,yeah, right.
