I could spend hours and hours
looking up at the sky.
So many stars,
so many mysteries...
that makes me think
of one very special person.
One of the most mysterious secrets
of the universe.
You see, I come from
that very mysterious and unique place.
We are the only known solar system
with double gravity.
Two twin planets
whirling together around one sun
but each with its own
and opposite gravity.
Now, in our world
it's possible to fall up
But... my story,
it's about love.
Some people say
that true lovers are one soul
And those two halves will always yearn
to find their way back together.
you're gonna need to know the three
basic laws of double gravity.
is pulled by the gravity of the world that
it comes from, and not the other.
An object's weight can be offset using
matter from the opposite world:
After a few hours of contact,
matter in contact with inverse-matter
All these laws are as old
as the universe itself.
They're are unchangeable,
and there are no exceptions.
What if love
was stronger than gravity?
Now let's go back
to the dark times
when any contact between worlds
was extremely dangerous
Up top had grown rich
and prosperous
we stole inverse-metal from up top
to heat our homes and to survive
I think he's dead.
Hey! Police!
They only authorized contact
between worlds is through TransWorld,
created to take cheap oil
from down below
and to sell back to us
overpriced electricity
Because of TransWorld,
I grew up in an orphanage.
You see,
my parents died in the Big Blast,
a TransWorld oil refinery explosion
that destroyed much of the city.
Fortunately,
there were the weekends.
They let me visit
my great aunt Becky,
As well as Becky, there were
two things that I truly loved:
model airplanes
and Becky's flying pancakes.
Going to have to get me
some more pink pollen tomorrow.
Okay, sweetie?
Becky also initiated me
into an ancient knowledge
passed down over the generations
to the women of our family...
Now catch!
Becky, how do they do that?
It's all in this book.
It was passed down
to my mother from hers.
And, of course,
I would have given it to your mother.
One day, when you grow up, it'll be yours..
Becky would often sent me to gather
pink pollen from the Sage Mountains.
This was the only place,
and a forbidden place,
Bees that fed of flowers
from both worlds
and without whom this story could
never have happened.
But I have a little secret
of my own...
I used to go chase inverse-rain
from up top.
One day
I went much further than usual,
climbing higher and higher
above the cloud line.
Hey!
Hi!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, where have you been?
I've been waiting ages for you.
Our neighbors got robbed.
They're saying it was a thief
from down below.
There's hunters with guns
and border patrol trucks.
Are you serious?
Don't make that face!
I made it here, right?
Look, as long as you're okay...
Hey, look, I'll throw it up!
- Alright, ready?
- Alright right, Adam!
Are you tied on?
- I'm done!
- Yeah?
Okay, I pull you down!
Don't drop me!
You know,
these ones from up top are so good...
- They're the best.
- Yeah, they are. They're amazing.
Oh, wait.
I got something for you, too...
And this is from both worlds.
What is it?
I can't tell you.
You gotta close your eyes.
Close your eyes!
Come on,
like 'closed' closed!
- I closed!
- Alright.
- Are they closed?
- Uhmm.
Okay, open your mouth.
I can't reach!
Mmh...
How is that from both worlds?
I don't know, you should
probably ask the bees.
I don't know.
Imagine if we could
go anywhere we wanted to.
I mean, really...
I can imagine that...
- Hey, you know what?
- What?
Well, we can.
Come on, let's imagine we can,
let's go down!
Are you holding on?
- Ready!
- Three, two, one...
Go!
Alright, I go down.
- You're holding on?
- Yeah.
Don't you let my legs go!
I got it, I got it!
- Okay, let it spin! Whoa!
- Whooo!
I've got my eyes closed.
Look at the branch, whoa.
- We gonna go again?
- Uhum.
- It's the biggest one ever.
- Alright, I'm ready.
- You hold on?
- Yeah.
Coming down!
Alright.
- Are you okay?
- Uhum.
Okay, mind if we go
for another spin?
Yeah, let's get really high,
let's get even higher than that.
Okay, yeah. Ready?
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
- We should go.
-
MAN 1: He's there!
MAN 2: Let's get him!
Quick, Adam!
Eden!
Eden!
Oh no!
No! No, please!
- ADAM: Becky!
- BECKY: No!
- ADAM: Becky, I'm sorry!
- BECKY : No!
Becky!
No, no! No!
- ADAM: Becky!
- BECKY: Adam!
You did nothing wrong!
Nothing!
Becky!
No, Becky!
Please, no! No!
Becky!
Adam, come on, stop!
Come on, make us a plane!
Oh, I can't.
I can't.
I gotta go to work.
Come on!
I gotta go to work.
I'll do it later!
Hey, Mr. Jones!
-
- Hello, Albert.
- Mrs. Nathanson.
- What do you have for me?
- Inverse-matter to pay my debts.
Will this cover it?
My husband says it's stainless steel.
From the main pipeline.
Oh...
ADAM: Pablo, it's ready.
Okay, don't start it till it's
fully applied.
PABLO: Okay.
ADAM: Okay, here we go.
MS NATHANSON: Wow, that stuff is amazing!
Is it for sale?
ALBERT : Oh...
Not great yet.
Nah.
- ALBERT: We're all settled, darl.
- MS NEYTONSON: Thank you.
And, uh... can you keep me
posted on that beauty cream?
We'll do. You take care, no?
Do you hear that, Adam?
We have got to finish this cream.
Well, I would love to,
Albert, you know, but...
with this equipment, you know,
it'd take years.
MAN ON TV: ...TransWorld will fulfill
everyone's dream
and transform his life working
for TransWorld.
We're live down below with our
nine finalists feverishly
awaiting the results.
MAN ON TV CONTINUES: I'd like to welcome
Ms. Eden Moore of TransPublicity,
- EDEN: Hi.
Welcome!
Now, she'll tell us more
about what she does.
But more importantly, let's hear
about our winner's new job.
Well, our division handles all of
TransWorld's graphic designs.
Uh... that sounds fascinating
but our audiences are dying to know...
Well, today we're offering the winner
a job in our department.
Let's choose our lucky winner.
ADAM: It's her.
- ADAM: Pablo, it's Eden.
- PABLO: Are you sure?
I'm probably sure.
ADAM: She-- she's alive!
I can't believe it!
I couldn't find her,
and she works at TransWorld!
ECHOING VOICE OVER PA: Attention,
this is a final call.
PA: Stay in line, prepare jackets and
personal objects for weighing.
PA VOICE: Please, remove your jacket and
empty your pockets of personal belongings for weighing.
Place your jacket in the bin as well.
PA: Stay in line, prepare jackets and
personal objects for weighing.
- CONTROL GUARD: Don't move.
-
- New?
- Yeah.
- What floor?
- Floor zero.
- Name?
- Adam Kirk.
Thanks.
-
-
MAN: Need some help?
ADAM: Uh, yeah, yeah. I-- I'm looking for
a station 15, sector 8.
Third aisle down.
Thank you.
"WELCOME"
MAN: Welcome aboard, newbie!
- WOMAN #1: Cheers.
- WOMAN #2: Cheers.
- Goddammit!
-
I'm so-- so sorry.
I-- I-- I had no idea...
- I was gonna--
- BOB: Don't worry, my friend.
They do that to all the newbies.
Oh, great...
My name's Bob,
Bob Boruchowitz.
And you are?
I'm Adam,
Adam Kirk.
ASSISTANT: Mr. Kirk?
Please, follow me. The managing
director is waiting to see you.
Right, sure, uh.
Okay, thanks.
BOB: Psst! Hey, hey!
Your back...
Your back, check it out.
ADAM: Oh...
Right... that's, uh...
That's pretty funny.
Oh ho.
ASSISTANT: Mr. Kirk,
we don't have much time!
Come see me on your way out
for the list of materials
you require for your work.
I need you to complete
your security clearance form.
I'll also give you your various
access badges and meal vouchers.
LAGAVULLAN: Come in, Mr. Kirk.
Come in, come in.
This anti-aging cream idea of yours
seams to be quiet promising.
Your application has been approved.
But this is strictly on a trial basis,
you understand?
O-- Of course.
Have a seat, please.
Thanks.
Fasten your seat belt, Mr. Kirk.
I'm sorry?
Your seat belt.
Seat...
Oh, right.
-
-
Are there any questions, Mr. Kirk?
Yeah, I was just wondering what
all these people up my side do?
Mmh...
They're merely adapters.
They adapt our products
to your world.
-
-
You on the other hand have
a real opportunity here.
Company policy
doesn't normally allow
for someone from... 'down below'
to hold such an important position,
but were making an exception
in your case.
Sign here, please.
-
-
Now then, a word of warning...
We scrupulously observe a full
separation between worlds here.
That means there is to be no
unnecessary contact with those up top.
Just stick to your job
and all will be well.
One last thing...
The rules are quite strict here.
As you know, you'll be working
with upper world materials.
This means that you will be
thoroughly searched and weighed
every time
that you leave the premises.
If they find
any inverse-matter on you,
you'll be fired
and jailed on the spot.
But I have a feeling that
this won't happen in your case, ...
will it, Mr. Kirk?
No, sir.
Try not to prove me wrong.
Right then...
Dismissed!
TV VOICE: Another massive oil leak has developed,
following a metal robbery from the main pipeline
The three thieves from down below
arrested last week were hanged
this morning at dawn
raising interworld tensions.
Here's the senior TransWorld
executive with a statement...
LAGAVULLAN: They got what they deserved.
We don't go down to their world,
- Hey.
- PABLO: Nice boss you got there.
ALBERT: Adam,
you did not have to do this.
I could have gotten you
that patent.
TransWo-- TransWorld is the worst
thing that ever happened to us.
And what now, you're...
you're one of them?
ADAM: Come on, Albert...
Those people are vultures.
And you're gonna give them
your golden goose for peanuts?
We have nothing!
Yeah, we're from down below.
I mean, that's just the way it is.
I mean, we have nothing.
Don't you tell me I'm nothing!
This isn't nothing,
this is everything!
And I gave you everything,
treated you like you were
my own son!
And you know what
you're gonna do?
You gonna go out there and
you're gonna get yourself killed!
That's all you're gonna do --
get your self killed.
Shit...
What?
Al-- Albert, come on!
I didn't mean it like that.
ADAM: Albert, please, come on!
Alright...
Don't you dare to think
that I have forgotten
that TransWorld took away
my entire family!
Alright?
Look...
If I could use TransWorld...
and... and aunt Becky's
pink powder just to...
I-- I-- I don't know...
Just to give my life
some kind of hope.
That's how I'm gonna do it.
Come on, Albert, please!
Come on,
I need you your help.
Albert, please!
Come on!
Alright...
Alright, I'll help.
PSYCHOLOGIST: Okay...
Today we have someone joining us
for the first time.
Hello, Eden.
EDEN: Hi.
Hi.
Eden. Eden Moore.
Uhm...
I had an accident
when I was a teenager.
Uhm...
Everything before that is gone.
Sometimes things come
back to me in dreams.
But I'm never sure if they're real
or if I'm making them up.
It's frustrating.
You know, I--
I know that whatever is missing,
it's in there.
Uhm...
But it scares me.
Uhm...
Mostly it just feels like
something's missing.
Mr. Kirk?
Yes.
Here's the key to your
personal refrigeration system.
And here's your very first allocation...
of inverse-matter.
Okay, great.
Be careful. Without cooling
it gets hot very fast.
Err...
Thank you.
BOB: Hey...
Not exactly a charmer, is he?
-
- Oh!
- MAN #1: Lunch time.
- MAN #2: Lunch time!
I usually go to the smoking room
after lunchbreak.
Why don't you drop by,
and we have a little conversation?
Okay, sure.
- ADAM: Hey, Bob?
- BOB: Mmh?
Mind if I come in?
Come in, come in,
sit down, hey!
Want a cigar?
- Smoke?
- No, no, thanks. I don't smoke.
Okay, fine.
See? Empty.
"No one smokes
in TransWorld anymore..." pfft.. Well, I do so.
Hell, people have a funny way
of seeing things here.
Anything or anyone different is--
well, they say...
'frowned upon'.
Can I ask you a favor?
ADAM: Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Can you get me some stamps?
Some stamps?
Yeah... stamps.
I, uh...
I don't like to boast, but...
I got one of the largest known
stamp collections up top.
And if you can get
me some from your side...
Oh, boy...!
Right, yeah,
I mean, uh, ...
I mean... sure, I guess.
Great... Great!
So, you're saying...
anti-gravity...
Yeah, you know, I-- I've...
Well,
I've been working on this, uh...
- Well, it's an anti-aging cream.
- Uhum.
Oh... well,
I'm here if you need me,
expert in conductivity,
in computer programming,
anything you need, anything,
just ask.
Well, then, uh...
I-- I-- I guess there could be
something you could help me with...
uhm...
I was wondering if you might be able
to get me in touch with an employee...
...up top.
Up top?
Yeah.
Her name's, uh...
Eden Moore.
Sure...
Sure.
ALBERT: So, what's your plan?
ADAM: I don't know yet.
Working on it.
PABLO: I mean,
but you've seen her, alright?
No, I mean...
I-- I haven't actually seen her, but...
...but she's there, Pablo. I mean,
she's just like a-- fifth floors above.
Are you sure this is worth it?
I mean it's been like ten years
since you last saw her.
Yeah... it's worth it.
BOB: It's amazing!
The ma-- The man with no hair!
I can't believe it!
So what kind of shirt you want?
- You want like a sport shirt?
- ADAM: No, no...
T-shirt?
One of of the button-down collars?
- Yes, like a normal button-down shirt.
- BOB: You want a jacket?
Yeah, like... I don't know...
a suit jacket.
You may proceed, Mr. Kirk.
Thank you.
-
-
Now, this should be happening
any moment now.
SCIENTIST: You watch carefully.
Here it comes.
How long does the effect last?
Well, right now really
only like a few minutes...
...but I...
we've been working on--
SCIENTIST: It's been working
long enough.
Soon we'll begin clinical trials
on human subjects.
Obviously, we start with a sample
of women from down below.
I need quick results.
I'm counting on you.
EMPLOYEE #1: Is that beauty cream
for Halloween?
EMPLOYEE #2: No, they got different
standards of beauty down below.
The... uglier the better.
BOB: Hey, don't let those guys
get to you.
They're just jealous,
that's all.
Are you... staying late?
Yeah, you know, I though I stay and
finish up a few things, you know.
Ah, yeah. Well, I take the dog
back to the kennel.
BOB : Come on, girl.
BOB : Hey, here!
BOB : You realize they don't pay
overtime, right?
ADAM: Yeah, I know.
BOB: Okay, alright.
See you tomorrow!
Don't work too hard!
ADAM : I won't.
Hello?
Yes, it is.
No, I'm sorry,
she's got home for tonight.
Yeah, you can come by tomorrow.
Okay, what's your name again?
BO-RU-CHOWITZ.
Thank you.
Okay, see you tomorrow.
ALBERT: Believe me, Adam,
it's gonna burn.
And the pinch... just use a little
water to cool it down.
Please, remember, you won't last
an hour with these kind of things on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know...
Alright, Pablo, what?
What is it?
Alright,
what's your plan, huh?
You dress up in disguise, you show
up to meet her, and then what?
Then what? I...
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
No, I don't know.
Alright, let me
get this straight, okay?
She sees you, alright, ....
she throws herself in your arms,
says she loves you, and-- and...
she never forgot about you.
- Yeah, yeah, maybe.
- Okay...
Since you're starting
to burn up...
you tell her you love her too,
but you really have to go.
And if you don't get
caught or shot,
maybe you see her again
in ten years.
Besides, what-- y-- you...
You really think she, uh...
she just waited for you?
- Yeah, I do.
- You do?
Yeah, actually I do.
Adam, you're from down below,
okay? Don't you get that?
Besi-- you know what...
I bet she calls the cops
the second she sees you.
- She's not gonna call the cops...
- Adam, you're so delusional.
Hey, why are you so obsessed
with those people, anyway, huh?
You know,
my brother was the same way...
when he went up there and...
well, he never came back.
You wanna end up like him?
"Hey, Eden. It's Adam!"
"It's Adam."
GUARD: Who's there?
GUARD :
Possible breach.
Ah!
Eden.
Eden, it's-- it's-- it's me!
Oh, yes, Mr. Boruchowitz, right?
I'll be with you in a second.
Wait...
Come on, Eden.
Hi.
I'm Paula.
We spoke on the phone yesterday.
I didn't realize
you guys knew each other.
Yeah, yeah, yeah... no, we do.
I mean, I can't believe she would
just ignore me like that.
No...
No, she just forgets things.
What do you mean?
It's her amnesia.
W-- wait, she has amnesia?
Yes, since her accident.
- EDEN : Will you get these two?
- PAULA: Yeah.
You wanted to see me?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, no, I did, uh...
Look, look, you know,
I thought that we...
I-- uh,...
I-- I thought...
that, uh...
that, uh...
...that this product
that I've been working on...
I-- I thought it might be of...
...some interest to you...
- ...professionally speaking.
- Uhum.
Yeah, I-- I-- uh...
Oh, would you...
Can I, can I show you...?
Yeah, sure.
That's just a mock-up.
You know, it takes a...
second to work, so...
Okay.
You know, uh...
I've, uh...
I've been working
with this, this...
young man...
who's just recently started
here at TransWorld.
But, uh...
He had like a trouble childhood.
Yeah, he grew up in a, like a...
like an orphanage.
Oh, that's terrible.
Yeah, you know hi--...
his aunt Becky...?
who's like his only
real family?
Well, you should've brought him.
Yeah...
Well, uh...
Th-- the truth is...
that he couldn't come.
Oh, why not?
Well, 'cause...
...he's from down below.
Oh... sorry.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
I just don't know why
you tell me this.
- ADAM: Anyway, I thought that--
- EDEN: Oh...
ADAM: ...the product might
be of some interest.
- That's amazing!
- Yeah.
It's perfectly straight.
What is this stuff?
It's top secret, actually.
I like secrets.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- No, I'm good.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, oh, yeah. I'm good.
- Wait, you're sweating.
Oh, really?
God, look at that...
- Do you want Translenol?
- No, no, really, I-- I'm good.
I'm pretty good.
You know what,
can you just, uh...
excuse me for like...
just one second.
- Okay.
- ADAM: I'll be back.
I'll be right back.
So funny.
-
-  Ohh, ahh!
Ahh!
Uh!
Hey! Stop!
EDEN: He's not coming back?!
Can you believe it?
PAULA: No, I don't.
But he is cute though...
- I know.
- Uhum.
PABLO: You know I hate to say it,
but I told she wouldn't remember you.
ADAM: Pablo... please.
ALBERT: She got amnesia
...after all of that.
Boy, you sure know
how to pick 'em.
You burned yourself
pretty good there too.
Put some more of that on,
tonight when you go to bed.
Okay.
ASSISTANT: Everything alright, Mr. Kirk?
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah...
everything's fine, just uh...
you know,
cleaning up a few things.
Here's the list of candidates
for your clinical trial.
Oh! Oh, great!
Thank you.
I'll come by at the end of the day
for your selections.
Psst! Hey!
BOB: May I see?
Sure.
Uh-ohh... man, Geez,
models like that...
Your goose is cooked, man!
What are they trying to do,
get fired or what?
BOB: Show time!
- MAN: It's showtime, honey.
- ADAM: What's that?
BOB: Oh, you'll see...
BOB: You just started here,
you'll be on to a lot of fun.
LAGAVULLAN
: Your attention, please.
Before we begin
handing out the bonuses...
we have a list of individuals whose services
will no longer be required:
Believe me, my friend...
Your things works out.
- You got nothing to worry about.
- BOB: Nah, that's not me.
That's a mistake.
Uhm, excuse me...
I'm sorry,
did you said 'Bob Boruchowitz'?
Well, uh, I think that's
a mistake, yeah?
There is no mistake,
Mr. Boruchowitz.
You lied of your seniority,
you will be given...
...but your TransWorld contract
has been terminated.
BOB: Don't ever trust
anyone here, Adam.
All a bunch of snakes.
ADAM: That's it? I mean, you just
pack up your things and leave?
BOB: 31 years... They toss you out
like a bag of garbage.
Yep, that's the TransWorld way.
This is for your collection.
Some things in here
may come in handy.
You're ready?
Yeah.
Okay, and...
I got it... I got it.
Hey, Bob.
I'm really sorry.
Don't worry about me my friend.
It's their loss.
Right.
Take care of yourself, right?
Right...
Come on, old girl.
We're out of here,
you're comin' with me.
-
- BOB: All these jerks...
...wind me up in a tin can.
Come on, girl, come on.
ADAM: Hey, Bob...
Thank you.
-
-
ANSWERING MACHINE: Out of office,
leave your message.
Hi, Bob,
it's Eden Moore calling you.
I was just wondering
what happened the other day.
You just rushed outta here--
ADAM: Mmpf...
E--Eden, Eden!
- Hey.
- Hi.
What happened to you?
Listen, I'm-- I'm--
I'm so so sorry...
for disappearing
on you like that, uh...
You know what, uh...
an alarm went off...
and the security
had everything blocked, so...
I was...
I was stuck for there for hours.
- Uhum.
- No, no, really.
I mean, I've been desperate
to call you, I--
I've been meaning to call you.
Alright, well...
I'll let you make it up to me.
Take me to lunch.
What?
Yeah, you can come in with
a better story by then.
Y-- Y-- You wanna go to
the cafeteria?
No, I thought we could eat out.
Eat out?
Yeah.
You don't want to?
No, no, no...
I'd love to!
Okay, great.
Uh... how about
café 'Dos Mundos', you know?
Yes...
Of course, uh... wow!
Café Dos Mundos.
Is that a problem?
No, no problem at all.
Okay, great.
I'll see you tomorrow at noon.
Alright, see you then.
- Bye.
ALBERT: You know I gotta admit...
I've always wondered
what it would be like.
ADAM: Now, well, maybe now you'll know.
Alright then, Pablo...
I can get you one thing,
one thing from up top,
what would it be?
- PABLO: One thing?
- ADAM: Yeah.
- PABLO: A girl.
- ADAM : A girl?
PABLO: I don't know, bring me back
one of the menus from the restaurant.
ADAM: Yeah, okay, I can do that.
How about you, Albert?
ALBERT: Yeah, I want you back.
ADAM : Okay, I'll try to
make sure that happens.
ALBERT: Alright.
- ADAM: Hey.
- Hi.
ADAM: How are you?
EDEN: Good.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
Oh, don't worry about it,
I just got here.
Oh, you did? Oh, good.
So, how come I've never seen you
around TransWorld before?
Well, I mean it's a--
it's a pretty big company.
I don't know, maybe that's why.
Do you live nearby?
Me? No, no, uh...
I-- I have a really long commute.
You know, I'm sorry...
Y-- You really don't remember me?
I mean, if you-- if you look at me,
like... I mean, really...
really look at me...
You don't remember me at all?
Come on, Eden...
Eden, we know each other.
- What?
- No, no, wait...
We really know each other,
I mean...
Why are you doing this to me?
What?
No, Eden...
Eden, please...
Damn...
Eden, wait!
Wait, wait, wait...
Come on, sorry...
Please, please, don't...
It's just a misunderstanding.
I just meant that we met before.
You know, it was at the elevator...
at work...
You dropped your papers and
I helped you pick 'em up.
- You don't remember that?
- No, I don't.
Yeah, why...
why would you, I guess.
Look, I-- I'm sorry...
I'm confused, a little nervous,
that's all.
You know, I didn't mean
to come at you like that.
I'm really sorry.
Can you forgive me?
Look...
I should get back to work,
I think.
Come on,
just stay for one drink.
You can't stay for one drink?
We don't even have to eat.
You know, uh...
I'm not even hungry.
U-- Unless, of course, you're hungry...
in which case I'm-- I'm--
I'm starving.
Yeah, I mean, I'll eat
the whole menu... tw-- twice! ...
...if-- if-- if you sit down
and have one drink.
- I'm starving, actually.
- Yeah? Great.
Wanna sit down?
ADAM: Isn't this upside down?
EDEN: I will teach you how to
drink that stuff, really.
EDEN: So...
- ADAM: How am I supposed to do it?
- EDEN: You have to...
- ...and you hold it like this...
- ADAM: Okay.
EDEN: Tilt it down.
EDEN: What?
- ADAM: How could I know?
- EDEN: For a year?
- EDEN: For a year?
- ADAM: Exactly.
Let's do it again.
A year.
- ADAM: These are good.
- EDEN: Yeah.
- ADAM: They're good.
- EDEN: Yeah, take it easy.
ADAM: Alright. Strong...
EDEN: Hey, you know,
I wanna show you something.
ADAM: Sure.
EDEN: Uhm... it's a personal project
of mine, but...
I wanna do it at a much larger scale...
but I find your invention
could come in handy.
Wow, that's...
That's amazing, really.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
It's amazing, I mean...
I'd love to help.
Yeah.
That's the...
Sage Mountains, right?
Yeah.
I, uh...
I grew up there.
We still have our old house there.
Yeah, I know. We used to
go out there all the time.
You know, we still, uh...
come and pick the pomegranates.
Yeah, me too.
- They're the best!
- They're the best.
EDEN: You're okay?
Uh? Yeah.
No, I'm good.
- I'm fine, no, really.
- Mmh.
It's getting, a little warm
in here, don't you think?
Let's get outta here.
- You wanna go?
- Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
We get the check?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
-
-
EDEN: So there's this great orchestra
from down below.
Uh, ...they play here
Friday nights.
They're incredible,
you have to hear it.
Wow, that sounds great.
Okay, so see Friday maybe?
- Yeah, su-- sure.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Thanks for lunch.
- Alright, take care.
Thanks.

SCIENTIST: Our demonstrator will
apply the full product live.
We'll be selling five separate creams
...according to the concentration
of the active ingredient,
...to the condition of
various facial regions.
And as you see,
a range of strengths
...allows the consumer to apply
what's needed where needed.
For a general purpose product
I think the level two
...provide visible
all-round improvement
Number five, being strongest,
can work miracles.
...now we're also developing a product
for the breasts and the buttocks.
-
- AUDIENCE: Bravo! Bravo!
- Any questions before we continue?
- MAN: Yes.
Couldn't we market a cheaper
version for down below...
...with only one product?
SCIENTIST: Oh, yes,
we could...
...at the very
lightest concentration.
The product doesn't hold up well
at very high doses.
Uhm, let's see what happens
with excessive application.
She had a product applied
about ten minutes ago, so...
I have a question to the demonstrator.
Mr. Boruchowitz, right?
Uhm...
I'm sorry, you must have
me confused with somebody else.
My name's Adam.
Adam Kirk.
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Eden Moore.
Have you seen her?
Yeah, she just left.
No, no!
Damn it!
-
-
DOORMAN: Hey, stop!
Security please...
PA VOICE: TransWorld.
For a better, brighter tomorrow.
That's him!
PA AD-VOICE: Gravity.
A revolution about to begin.

YOUNG EDEN: Hey!
YOUNG ADAM: What are you doing here?
YOUNG EDEN: I'm looking for my dog.
YOUNG ADAM: What's your name?
YOUNG EDEN: I can't talk to you.
Why not?
You're from down below.
I'm Adam.
-
-
You son of a gun!
I knew you're
up to something.
Bob, can I come in?
'Course, that's what I'm here for.
Come on, come on.
You see...
Man...
We're like real estate agents.
You know, we buy and sell...
...keep our options open.
Women... well...
They're more like contractors.
You know, they build to last.
BOB: You see the difference?
ADAM: Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.
BOB: Oh, you will,
you will, my friend.
Right, right, well, ...
I made it maximum weight
...to the exterior layer
to cover the heating problem.
Now, my friend,
try this for size.
If it fits, you are through
with overheating.
ADAM: This is nice...
Whoa, wow,
this is nice.
BOB: Oh, boy, oh, boy.
TransWorld are gonna curse the day
they fired me.
You got it?
That's a pretty good fit.
Good, good, right.
Well, I will get back
to the outer layer...
The icing on the cake!
BOB: I don't get it.
It's impossible to change
gravity status.
Are you sure?
ADAM: Yeah, absolutely.
Look, all we have to do...
...is carefully...
...mix the two opposing solutions...
...and wait a second to stabilize gravity...
...and then...
Voilà!
No...
God!
That is better than
a good idea, my friend.
That is...
...revolutionary!
But don't they have the formula now?
No.
No, I gave 'em everything
but the main ingredient.
Ah, hooo!
I would give good money...
...just to see the look on
Lagavullan's face right now!
So, are you telling me
we don't have the formula?
We...
SCIENTIST: Well, we tried to
recreate it several times.
But the thing is,
we're missing an ingredient, uh...
Pink powder.
We found traces in his office.
Without it there is no cream.
That's unacceptable!
You can't figure out without him?
No.
-
-
You remember?
I'm starting to.
Everybody up against the wall!
OFFICER: Now, this way, please.
Damn it!
Listen, I gotta go.
No!
- I'll find you!
Hey, you!
Hey, stop!
Stop!
Border Police have launched a
massive manhunt for a fugitive
All national law enforcement
agencies have been alerted
...and we'll keep you updated
as the story develops.
ADAM: Come on, let's go.
Wait, wait, wait...
What?
I-- I-- I just thought
I heard something.
- ADAM: Are you okay?
- EDEN: Yeah.
Go, go, go, go!
Eden, come on!
Come on, come on, come on!
Go, go, go!
Eden, the waist!
- ADAM: Take on my waist!
- EDEN: Okay!
ADAM: Come on!
Eden, take this arm!
EDEN: Hold on!
Hold on, hold on!
Eden, hold on!
ADAM: Hold on!
EDEN: Hold on!
I'm holding you!
Don't let go!
Hold on, hold on!
- Let go off me, please.
- EDEN: No!
No!
I'm so sorry.
EDEN: No!
- I'm so sorry.
- EDEN: No!
POLICE OFFICER: The guy fell.
MS. NEYTONSON: Hello.
Nice to have you back.
ADAM: Thanks.
No, no, wait!
Don't do this to me! Ugh!
No, no!
- ADAM: Oh, please, no!
- AGENT: Get in the car!
ADAM : Ahh, no!
Don't do this to me!
You give us the complete
anti-aging cream formula
...and if you attempt to
contact Ms. Moore
...charges against her
will be reinstated.
Do I make myself clear,
Mr. Kirk?
-
They took aunt Becky
and they took Eden from me.
Oh, it's hard to accept that I will
never see Eden again.
I was naive to think that
I can change the world.
So I guess I just
go back to my life...
Gently does it...
Victory!
BOY #1: So, is it true
everyone's rich up top?
BOY #2: Don't you know,
it's total paradise up there!
ADAM: Paradise?
Well, guys, I--
I don't think so, you know.
Th-- they might be
rich, sure, but...
...it's definitely not paradise.
Hey let me look at that, huh?
What do you think, we should,
uh, think we should make this fly?
BOYS: Yeah.
Oh yeah, we'll give it
a boost?
Alright, hold on a bit.
Alright, now try.
Go on, throw it.
You haven't shown up
for four days.
Did you get those strange
flowers we sent over?
I hope you're alright.
Bye.
Bob?
Boruchowitz?
Yeah?
I'm Eden.
Moore.
I need your help.
BOB: Yeah! Fantastic!
Bob... Bob!
What?
You think you're the only one
who can go upside down?
You won't get rid of me!
Easy as that, old buddy!
How did you make this?
I mean, how--
how did you do it?
Hey, hey, hey...
Check this out!
Did you make a vest
or what?
I can't believe it!
Oh, oh!
Put me down, sweetie!
You're not even wearing a vest!
- No, no...
- Where's the weights?
No, no, no... We're 90%
water, right?
So I combine
upper and lower inversion...
with a hyper... infusion, yeah?
Now, you know this better than I do.
But, but the breakthrough, man, ...
the-- the breakthrough, ahh...
Ahh, man, I'm jabbering...
The pro--
The problem is, right, ...
The effect only lasts an hour,
right? I'll improve it.
Oh... you, you my friend...
Hey, you...
you have a rendezvous.
What's this?
"CAFE DOS MUNDOS"
You better not go dressed like that.
Hey, did you tell him?
Hey, another thing...!
The cream...
Well, thanks to your stamps
...I bought the patent
under the name 'Albert & Co.'
...before...
TransWorld.
Nice! Nice!
EDEN: Adam!
Eden!
I can't believe it!
How did you get down here?
EDEN: Bob found a way
to bring me down.
ADAM: I can't believe it.
I-- I-- I don't know
what happened to you?
Are you okay?
I'm pregnant.
We're having twins.
ADAM: I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!
How long can you
stay down here for?
Forever, maybe.
Bob said
it's because I'm pregnant.
He said you'd understand
...how this makes me different.
I love you.
I love you.
ADAM: We didn't realize yet the
repercussions of what we had done.
Our love would forever
alter the course of history.
