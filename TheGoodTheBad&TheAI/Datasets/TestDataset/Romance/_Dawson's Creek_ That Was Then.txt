Be real nice, I might put
that bag up there for you.
-What's going on here?
-Who is this guy, Vicki?
To collect the necessary--
You could only marry one of us.
If I didn't know how you really felt
about Del, I'd think you were jealous.
Eat your cak e.
-I'll go.
-Howdy. We'd lik e to see the judge.
He's just having his dinner.
That's all right, Caroline. Come on in.
-Well, what is it?
-We got fired today.
Ed Carter's gun guards
run us off the property.
-Why were you fired?
-There's been too many hold-ups.
We've all been too
friendly to Jericho Howard.
-That's what Ed Carter says.
-Up to him to say who works for him.
Bad timing?
You're on your way out.
No, it's cosmic timing.
l was on my way to see you.
-Really?
-Yeah. Yeah, l was....
l was hoping that we could stand
awkwardly in a doorway, which...
-...is working out perfectly for me.
-lt's not awkward, Pacey.
-How about l come in?
-Great idea.
Can l get you anything?
You want something to drink?
No, l'm okay.
-You-- You hungry?
-You know what'd be nice?
Pizza? That's funny.
l was thinking pizza myself.
lt would be nice if we
could stop being polite.
l'm really glad that you said that.
l've been meaning
to emotionally abuse you.
-l wanted to make sure you're up for it.
-Pacey.
Okay, l'll stop.
Do you regret it?
-Which part?
-Do you regret telling me?
l guess it really depends on
whether or not you regretted hearing it.
lt's hard to regret hearing something
that's been in the back of your mind.
But l think l regret reality as...
...just a general concept.
Really?
Do you remember reading those
Choose Your Own Adventure books?
You and l both know that l was pretty
much illiterate until the ninth grade.
Right. Okay, well, l did.
But l cheated on them.
When a chapter wasn't
going the way l wanted...
...l wouldn't even finish. l would
just go back to the beginning until...
-...l got a happy ending.
-Everybody does it.
But it's not the most
realistic way to live.
What makes you think that one false
move is gonna ruin our entire story?
-History.
-That was then. Joey...
...l'm serious. We're older now.
lt's not like l'm gonna run out
if l don't like your choice.
Okay. Well, so....
What are you afraid of?
That the whole possibility thing
is really just a mean trick.
l don't like this chapter.
lt's too negative.
Look....
Maybe l'm just trying to...
...play out the scenarios to be
sure you and l have grown enough...
...to be together without
having to replay our history.
Because l'd really like
to look into our future.
-You want a clean slate.
-Well....
Yes and no. l just don't want my
prior offences being held against me.
Well, l mean, we agree.
You and l have...
...you know, said things and--
And done things that...
...we regret, but...
...we've changed, haven't we?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So l'm gonna go
think about some things.
And you're gonna think about things.
And you should probably go now
before l lose my ability to think clearly.
Well, okay, but...
...Pace, l don't know.
l mean, don't you think that...
...this is a little too delicate
to handle without a plan?
A plan. Well....
You know, l-- l appreciate
that you're a slave to structure...
...but l'm not sure how to
schedule life-changing decisions.
Well, what l meant...
...is that, you know...
-...l could call or you could call and--
-Right.
Like you've ever needed an excuse.
-Go.
-Of course.
What about that pizza thing?
Well, that would be
an entirely different story.
Surely you know how
difficult it is to secure a date...
...with a member of
the Sociology Department.
l mean, those women
are slick and fancy and...
...look at me like l'm the latest
study in the failure of modern man.
l thought you'd given up
since the last disaster.
l had, especially after time with Harley,
realizing how evil the fairer sex is...
...from conception.
But, l mean, come on, let's face it.
lf l don't do this now, l'm gonna
die alone in that old house.
What do you say? You can study, and l
can try to find a shirt from this decade.
Fine. Okay?
But l don't feel good about this dating
thing. l think it's time you look inward.
You're so wise since
distance left you single.
l'm not feeling right about
unleashing Harley on you yet either.
She's been loopy these days.
l think she's into the drugs.
lt's called hormones.
l wouldn't worry about it.
l'm-- l'm very worried
about her. She-- She--
She's got pictures of boys on the
ceiling. l mean, why there, Potter?
What purpose do you suppose those
pictures would serve in that location?
Professor Hetson,
Harley is completely normal.
One might even worry she's a cliché.
l don't like the sound of a normal girl.
l corrupted a lot of those.
They will do anything
to not be normal.
l want her to be more like you.
You know, anxious, bookish, prone to
boyfriends who live far, far away.
-Thank you.
-So no boys at the house...
...calling the house or slowing down
while they walk by the house.
You better watch it, you know.
Sexual deviation might
not be on Harley's mind...
...but if you keep being strict,
she's gonna realise...
...there's something
she's missing out on.
l've just accepted that l am powerless
against the high school alpha male.
l can't fight them, so l'm gonna
build a moat around the house.
l mean, what about you? You had
a boyfriend in high school, right?
What was he like?
People change.
Three-thirty, Potter.
And leave your open mind at home.
Don't sully Harley with all that free will
and bringing out the best in people.
Dawson Leery, this is your life.
That's what l was just thinking.
How you doing, Mr. Gold?
The surreal nature
of things aside, just fine.
Thanks for coming in today, Dawson.
Class is pretty excited.
You've given them hope for escape.
So they haven't stopped to wonder
why l've come back.
l think they assume
they're just a pit stop.
-That would be nice.
-Slow going?
Well...
...l was trying to figure out a way
to tell these kids how to...
...make a success of themselves, so
l decided to watch all my old movies.
l wonder why
l didn't go to law school.
Sounds to me like you're ready to
take over my class. Let's go.
No, Marty, thank you, believe me.
Okay, l'll talk to you soon.
l'm gonna put you through.
Right. Bye.
Mr. Witter?
-What you got for me?
-There's a call for you on line one.
-I think it's--
-Okay, thank you.
Hello, what can l do--?
Hey, how you doing?
Okay, what hospital you guys at?
Okay. l'll be there soon, Mom.
Doug, Doug, hey.
Where is he?
They just took him down for tests, but
he's up, Pace. He's walking, at least.
l sent everyone else home. Mom was
exhausted, and l don't blame her.
-ls this his room here?
-Yeah, they'll be right back.
Dougie, what's with the old guy? ls that
the waiting room for the morgue?
-Just have a seat.
-Didn't you get him a private room?
We tried. They were full.
There wasn't time to argue over this.
There's time now, isn't there?
-What kind of tests is he having?
-Just routine tests.
-Was it a heart attack?
-No, not exactly. lt's what they call...
...an exaggerated arrhythmia.
l don't understand much
about the whole medical science--
Who can l find around here who
does know what they're talking about?
You know what? l'd love
to sit and walk you through this.
That's what l intended,
but you don't blow in here...
...and accuse me of not knowing,
since l've been here all day.
l'd have been here sooner
if you called sooner.
l'm sorry, but we were kind of busy.
l was trying to keep Mom
from having a breakdown...
...while our father
was being rushed off.
l'm sorry if things aren't
up to snuff here...
...but we were concentrating
on important things.
Like the fact Dad survived.
So any questions?
Todd Carr's the guy
who directed the film, right?
Yeah. Yeah, he directed...
...everything. Except
for the ending, which is...
-...pretty drastically di--
-Todd Carr is known for directing...
...gratuitous, fleshy music videos
and the occasional blood-fest.
But you're more of a
sentimental realist, right?
-ls that the word on the street?
-l showed some copies of your work.
You know, for a
little compare and contrast.
So when faced
with a different style...
...patching together someone's work,
is it a struggle not to put yourself in?
Fortunately, l had gotten
to know Todd so well...
...and we worked on it so long,
we ended up having a shared vision.
You think that's good,
given the film went straight to cable?
And you didn't go
to film school, right?
No, l didn't.
Woody Allen dropped out of NYU,
so it's all just how you wanna learn.
Do you have a minute or 1 8?
-Yeah. l'm sorry. What's your name?
-George.
l'd really like to show you my film.
Mr. Gold said it might be a good idea.
-Personal stuff.
-l'd love to.
Give me 1 0 minutes,
and then we'll watch it here.
lf that's all right with Mr. Gold.
Cool. Hey, thanks, Mr. Leery.
Please tell me he
didn't just call me mister.
My name is Ben, by the way.
He's quite a kid, George.
He thinks he knows a lot.
He must be a
handful in the classroom.
Dawson, waiting six years for you to
experience all this was well worth it.
Thanks again.
Please don't. l can hear myself
thinking when it's quiet. lt scares me.
l'd be scared too if l were writing
a paper your father wanted to read.
ln fact, the same thing
has scared me many a time.
-What page are you on?
-lt's all up here.
Right.
Harley, you gotta work with me here.
Your dad won't get any
easier if you keep aggravating him.
-Why do you care so much?
-Well....
When he loses control over you, he
wields his power over everyone else.
So you're a smart girl, l want
to see an intro in half an hour.
-How do you know?
-You're already bored with life.
Which is gonna get worse if
you spend your teen years locked up.
So get to it.
Subtle, Patrick. Real subtle.
l got a little excited in there
with all your girly things.
l have a ski parka in there, freak.
lt still smells like girl.
l do, however, have to--
This is Patrick.
He's my study partner.
And as you can see, you can do this.
I'll put it in my machine and....
Set it and forget it!
Eighteen minutes a pound for
a pork loin roast or for a leg of lamb...
-Coffee.
-... or for a roast beef. Okay?
Here's our pork loin roast. On the top.
Lift that up there. Look at this.
-Oh, look at that.
-We have our potatoes and our beans.
Now, it only uses 1 200 watts--
They moved him.
Yeah. l went ahead and
got him that private room.
Oh, good for you.
How'd you swing that, slip him a 20?
That's one way to solve it, l guess.
Doug, l'm sorry.
l got myself all worked up on the drive
thinking about the possibilities and...
...l appreciate the fact that you've been
here. l am sorry. l was just on edge.
Try having breakfast with Dad and
see him grab his chest and fall over.
l mean, have you ever seen him
off-guard one single day in your life?
No.
No. Not even close.
Which is probably what's so scary
about this whole thing. l mean...
...l spent so long pushing the
old man's buttons in high school...
...l forgot there were
real feelings left.
Okay, Patrick, if that's even your
real name. Let's see what you got.
You can help Harley out of her rut,
since you're her study pal and all.
-l'm actually not in that class.
-No!
-l'm shocked.
-Look, Joey, l get it.
Boy in room, bad.
lt's not like we were in
our skivvies, okay?
Yeah, l mean, a girl like you must've
broken the rules once or twice.
-Know what l mean?
-No, l don't know what you mean.
Look, Josephine,
l didn't mean to cause any trouble.
And l don't want to get in the middle
of whatever bond you and Harley got.
And l'm sure the three
of us can work together.
Not in the way you're
thinking, l'm afraid.
Harley, l've clearly
caused some stress here.
l respect the responsibility
this woman's taking in your life.
How old exactly do you think l am?
Well, it's not old so much
as wise, really.
You seem to be a timeless sort.
Pained by the world.
But more beautiful
because of it.
That's very deep.
Unfortunately, l know your kind,
and you're harmless.
So you are staying down here for the
rest of the night and studying for real.
This is Joey. Sorry I missed you.
Please leave a mess--
Hey, Pace, he's awake.
We can go in now.
You gotta lay off red meat, Mr. Witter.
Hey, boys.
This must be your
other son, Mr. Witter.
Yeah, this is-- This is Pacey, doc.
He's the one l was telling you about.
Yeah, the black sheep.
Pleased to meet you.
Your father was just going
on and on about how proud he is.
Yeah, who'd have thunk it, huh?
He turned out all right.
Gonna be taking care of
all of us one of these days.
Yeah. Anyway, how
you feeling? You doing okay?
Thanks for coming, Pace.
lt means a lot.
l know how busy you are.
l don't mean to break things up,
but you're still pretty weak, Mr. Witter.
One kid at a time, okay?
l can just wait outside
till you guys are ready.
No, Pace.
l want you to stay.
Come on, sit down.
Okay. That's okay.
You know, l've been
here all day, right? So....
Thanks, Dougie.
All right.
Did you drive down?
Yeah, yeah, l came
down as quick as l could.
-Not much traffic?
-No.
-Who's coming to Capeside?
-Yeah, well, you were.
Thanks. l appreciate it, Pace.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
-For what?
-Your silence speaks volumes.
You don't know me well enough
to know what my silence means.
With Mr. Gold, he's trying to formulate
the best possible way to eviscerate me.
What did he say?
Why won't you talk about my film?
All right, look. l'm....
l'm new at this, George. l mean...
...do you have any idea
how it is to come back...
...and try and say something
profound about life?
No offence, and other obligatories...
...but l'm as ill-suited to analyse your
doubt as you are to critique my film.
And my mother
serves dinner at 6, so--
l'm stalling, George, because
l don't know what to say, all right?
l mean, keep going.
You know, your film's good.
lt's very good.
Yeah, you got stuff to learn.
l mean, you know...
...trust yourself when you go for shots.
Work on continuity. Other than that...
...the important stuff,
the stuff you can't teach is--
-lt's there.
-So l'm a natural genius?
There's nothing left
for me here?
-You are like me when l was your age.
-Yeah?
-Mr. Gold said that too.
-Did he?
Well....
Remember this feeling.
Remember what it was like to make
a film about something that you loved.
Have the confidence to do it your way,
to control your vision, keep it your own.
l mean, that's....
-l miss that.
-Yeah.
You do have the stink
of a burnt-out talent on you.
lt's scary.
Yeah, l'm a poster child.
Get out of here before l rub off on you.
l thought it was good. Creek Daze.
Syrupy sweet with
lame music and all that.
But not many too people
have heart anymore.
You can't lose that, right?
Hope not.
All right. Stay in school, keep
your nose clean. Don't do sports.
Anyway, l blame your mother, Pacey.
She got herself this new cookbook,
Bacon Mak es the World Go Round.
Well, l guess that's not the
worst concept l've ever heard of.
Well, it is when the bacon is
going on top of the apple crisp.
l think she's trying to kill me.
Which is funny because you're the only
one in the family who's got any money.
This is serious.
lf you got heart problems...
-...you really gotta take care of that.
-Calm down.
This is nothing.
Just a little exaggerated arrhythmia.
Hell, you probably
got the same thing.
l don't know why your
brother's worked up.
Well, l think you gave him
a bit of a scare.
He said you went down pretty hard.
He's just looking for some drama.
He needs to get out more.
He needs to get a life like you.
Listen, it can't be good for you,
being away from the office this much.
l'm pretty sure they'll understand.
-What about your clients?
-You're my father.
You really would do anything for me.
Even after everything, you're still....
You grew up to be one
of the good guys, Pacey.
But l always knew you would.
l should've told you that more often.
Well, maybe l just
didn't always hear you.
Joey, l noticed you're
reading Don DeLillo.
-White Noise is one of my favourites.
-Really?
And when in your 1 5 years of life
did you manage to read this?
l'm 1 6, actually.
l look younger than l am.
l just got my license.
You wanna see?
Will you please shut up?
l'm trying to write.
Oh, l'm sorry. Joey and l can
go in the other room.
-No, we can't.
-Patrick, why don't you just leave.
-What's your problem?
-You really have to ask?
l asked you here to study.
-You and l both know--
-Okay, fine. Whatever.
l asked you over here to be with me.
Not salivate over my babysitter.
-You know how gross that is?
-l can't believe you need a babysitter.
When your parents go,
don't you stay with the Johnsons?
Yeah, that's just for safety.
So you don't choke
on your own spittle.
That's enough from the both of you.
-Can we just forget it and move on?
-Easy for you to say, Helen.
-Excuse me?
-The face that launched 1 000 ships.
Get people riled up and
then knit somewhere in solitude.
Okay. l think you're
mixing up your epics.
The point is, my boyfriend
is blatantly flirting with you.
-Would you really call it that?
-Am l your boyfriend?
l hate you so much right now.
l hate you with the burning
passion of a thousand STDs.
-We haven't had the talk.
-No, how could we?
Whenever l try to
be serious with you...
...you turn into some freak of nature
and you do stuff like this.
-Like what?
-Like staring at Joey all night.
Selling me out in
homeroom when we're late.
Not agreeing to go to the dance
with me until Lauren Riley said no.
Okay, the homeroom thing was because
l was trying to save your reputation.
And the Lauren thing
was purely defensive.
And, you know, l got scared.
l don't know. l-- l was just...
-...keeping my options open.
-Options?
Yeah, well, take me
off your list of options.
That should make things so much
easier for your tortured, ass-y soul.
Shouldn't have said that thing
about the options.
To begin with.
Hey, there you are. Dougie...
-...Dad's ready to see you now.
-Yeah, that's okay.
The nurse said they'll be shutting down
visiting hours, so let's get a move on.
Did he ask for me?
What, like did he send for you?
We're talking about our father, not the
king. He knows we're both here for him.
l love the knowledge you acquired on
Dad in the hour that you've been here.
Throwing around paternal references
like they're going out of style.
You've always been more up
on fashion than me.
Just don't even start, Pacey.
For once.
l know you're on your game since
Dad's given you the nod--
Okay, okay, hold on. What is it that
you actually want to talk to me about?
From my way of seeing things...
...we are just trying to take care
of our family.
No, Pacey, l'm the one who's been
taking care of the family for years.
Oh, now, Doug, don't
you dare get righteous on me.
You cannot lord your resentment
over me, because that was your choice.
Yeah, l do happen to make choices.
That's a foreign concept to
someone who plays musical careers.
How did we get here?
Am l stepping on your turf?
Are you the only member of the
family who's allowed to care?
What did you expect me to do?
Chomp on my cigar on the phone...
...and cut a check for the man's
funeral? l'm a member of this family.
Yeah, conveniently. l mean,
that's the way it is with you lately.
You swoop in with your gifts and you
pull the wool over the family's eyes.
And then you're out.
-And everybody forgets.
-Forgets what?
That l'm the family failure?
Am l never supposed to grow up?
Am l not allowed to want things?
Oh, no, we all want things, Pacey.
Believe me, we all want things.
-Nobody would deny you that.
-Then what?
l'm just not supposed to get them.
So ultimately,
this is not about our father.
Which is kind of pathetic, considering
the condition that that man is in.
This is about wanting to see my face
and know that you're still the good son.
That you're top dog.
Well, that's just sad.
l miss the daily beatings as much as
you do, but l had to leave sometime.
Pacey, don't make this
a celebration of your retreat.
l'm not. Man, listen to yourself
speak. l came here to see you.
To see him.
And you know what?
He knows it and he appreciates it.
Perhaps he's happy that the son he
ignored for the better part of his life...
...is not gonna hold a grudge
against him until the day he dies.
ln a strange way,
this might even be a good thing.
Yeah, you know what?
lt is a good thing, Pacey.
lt's all yours, little brother.
lt's all yours.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Harley, come on.
You're blowing this
way out of proportion.
Yeah, come on, Harley.
This probably isn't the
last time l'll incur your wrath.
l mean that in the best way possible.
-You ever had a girlfriend?
-Was it bad?
She likes it when we fight.
That's the only form of communication
you seem capable of.
l'm capable of other forms. l think.
Look, Joey. Harley's
way smarter than l am.
l tried the so-called normal thing
with her once, and it wasn't pretty.
l was complimenting her
and l felt all sweaty.
-l was a freaking mess.
-Despite what you think...
...the sweaty palms and such
is actually pretty endearing.
Harley!
Yeah, it's endearing for five seconds.
Then she'll look at Peter Garran and be
smitten with his unavailability...
...and l'll be history.
lf l keep up with the witty abuse...
-...at least l'll be the funny one.
-lt's true.
Oh, my God. lt is true.
You guys are all the same.
Joey, you've got--
You've got some anger.
You've been hurt.
Maybe you've lost someone.
So have you.
Harley.
l never could've held on
to a firecracker like her.
Maybe l need someone
who's more settled in her ways.
An older woman,
if you know what l mean.
You and me?
lt's not gonna happen.
And, look, Harley
is this great sassy girl...
...who if she's smart
will never speak to you again.
You slay me, Joey.
The only thing l want to do
to you is give you some advice.
Walk away right now.
Don't ever mention me again.
Go home and strum your guitar,
or whatever it is you do.
And then dream up some
fantastic gesture to get this girl back.
And never think that you have
to stop doing that sort of thing.
The worst thing a guy
can do is give up the chase.
And Patrick-- Patrick, Patrick.
Be realistic.
lf l wasn't such a nice girl, l would've
laughed and called you Junior.
Then why didn't you?
Because you remind me
of somebody l know.
Get out before l remember everything
that pissed me off about him.
-We might never speak again.
-l'm crying inside. Goodbye, Junior.
Harley. Come on,
it's just me. Please?
-Hey.
-Hey.
l just wanted to stop by before they
close up shop, see how you feel.
l feel like l could use a Scotch.
Other than that, l'm fine.
Maybe l could stop by in the
morning before l head back.
-Yeah.
-Dougie, l'll see you back at the house.
Yeah, maybe.
-Good night, guys.
-Pacey...
...thanks for getting me
this private room.
No, that wasn't me.
Doug took care of the room.
But good seeing you, Pop.
Feel better.
Harley!
Hope l didn't put a damper
on your evening.
Sounds like you two were
having a swell old time.
You and l are mildly
acquainted, correct?
Yeah, whatever.
l wouldn't go after your guy.
-lt's just not kosher.
-l know you wouldn't go for Patrick.
-You're a girl's girl and all that.
-And he wouldn't go after me.
He was just...
...doing what they do,
which is testing the limits.
l get that, Joey. l know that half
the time Patrick's just testing me.
What l don't get is, why would he test
something that's on shaky ground?
He started messing with me before
we figured out if we were together.
Was it this hard for
you in high school?
Of course.
l mean, but everything's
twenty-twenty in hindsight.
You know, now all of the problems
that Pacey and l had seem petty.
And all the obstacles that Dawson and
l went through just seem unnecessary.
Dude, how many
boyfriends did you have?
lt's not as racy as it sounds.
Okay, so how do
l skip the middle part?
Like, if you could tell yourself
something back then, what would it be?
l've been wondering lately...
...why things were different.
You know, why l could talk
to Eddie without being scared.
And, you know, when
you're 1 6 years old...
...so many of your choices
are motivated by fear.
You know, like, one wrong move
and the world's gonna end.
And maybe that's what it is.
Maybe it's just about....
l don't know, taking
a deep breath and...
...forgiving yourself
for yesterday's mistakes.
You're gonna walk in tomorrow,
and you're gonna wanna punch Patrick.
But he might just say something
that makes you change your mind.
Hear it, Harley.
So....
Don't be afraid to move forward.
lf all of this is about Eddie, why didn't
you follow him across the country?
Because it's not just about him.
lt's....
lt's about me and...
-...what l'm ready for.
-What are you ready for?
That, young lady,
is none of your business.
Your father's gonna be home soon...
...and l don't think l saw too much
essay writing happening down there.
Okay, okay. God, when is
this battleaxe thing ever gonna end?
l mean, you're becoming
highly unpleasant.
Never. l'm honing
my wench skills. Chop-chop!
Pacey?
Dawson.
What are you doing here?
Long story. At the moment, bringing
in firewood. What are you doing here?
l wanted to check on your mom,
see how the repairs are going.
-Wow, that's.... Thank you.
-Yeah.
You all right?
Yeah, l'm fine. But l checked
my dad into the hospital today.
-Oh, my God. ls he okay?
-Yeah, he'll be okay. lt was...
...a heart condition. But he's gonna get
out in the morning, so he'll be all right.
But, you know, no matter
how tough you think your dad is...
...it's a little disconcerting seeing
him laying there all vulnerable.
Yeah.
Can turn your world upside down.
Yeah.
Which is what made me think of you.
And probably a lot of
what brought me out here.
l just-- l wasn't ready
for that, you know?
lt's the first time l just--
l wanted to let somebody else
take care of it.
l know what you mean.
l don't know when this happened.
l'm the one who makes sure
the house is warm...
...and you became the one
who checks up on repairs.
l do not know, but sometimes
l feel like l've been...
...playing the part, wearing
the suit for so long...
...l may have forgotten how
l got there in the first place.
l know you deal with this more,
but some kid called me sir.
-What is that?
-l know. lt's strange.
Every time l hear '' Mr. Witter,''
l look over my shoulder.
-Who called you sir?
-This kid in my--
l almost said this kid in my class.
l went to Capeside High today.
-What, in your mind?
-Almost.
No. l went to go talk to
Mr. Gold's film class.
-Get out of here. Really?
-Yeah.
l guess that's what they
call coming full circle, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, l went there.
l was supposed to talk about...
...where l am now and the glamour
of the real world and all that, but....
lt was weird, Pace.
Watching this kid's film, all l thought
was, '' l don't know anything.''
Or maybe l did, and l just...
...lost it somewhere along the way.
Yeah, l know what you mean. l do.
Being here.
Being at the school, all these ghosts.
l wanna go back. l wanna start over.
Do things the right way.
Yeah.
Yeah, l'd like the time back.
But l wouldn't have it the way it was.
l just want to pinpoint that moment in
your life where everything goes wrong.
-l'm thinking it was probably puberty.
-Yeah, l could skip that too.
lf you didn't have loves, you wouldn't
have anything to make movies about.
Sure.
Except now that l actually...
...have enough distance and
l can actually say something about...
...the loves, l can't
afford to make movies.
Afford?
Those are the people l cater to.
-Come on. l'm a wizard of high finance.
-Right, right, right.
l'm the kind of person you prey on.
Sentimental loser
with 1 0-cent dreams.
-More like 1 0,000, but who's counting?
-l'm sorry, but...
...you're just freaking me out there.
We can talk about
that some other time, sir.
All right.
l just made some coffee. Do you wanna
come in and sit down for a while?
lt's been a long day.
Yeah. Yeah, l'd love that, man.
Hey, you've reached my cell phone.
Sorry I missed you, leave a message.
Hi, it's me.
So l thought that l would have an
answer when l picked up the phone...
...but l didn't.
And then l thought l would...
...think of something
as l was talking...
...but no such luck.
Pace...
...l think the problem is trying to figure
this out alone. l think that we should...
...do it together, you know?
And...
...you know how they say if you could
do it over, what would you change?
Well...
...l'd probably change a lot of things.
But l'm also really lucky
that l have the chance.
And...
...what l'm saying is l'm not gonna
think of everything that happened.
l'm gonna look at you and
think of everything that could.
Call me.
Bye.
