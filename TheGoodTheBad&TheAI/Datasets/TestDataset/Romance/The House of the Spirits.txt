my mother noticed that it was passionate for him.
wanted, we didn't get to talk.
Esteban, if it is that also the will of the Rose...
for us the important...
... it is not only that the Rose is happy,
but also... - I am decided...
to work arduously everyday.
are convinced...
that to work always arduously,
one day I will be sufficiently rich for...
no, Clara.
that one day will be sufficiently rich to take the Rose to the altar.
Clara, not!
two years later,
discovered the gold that would take him of turn Pink
The love made him to go down bottom in the mine,
but the arduous work and the wait turned his desire still larger.
finally, he had success and soon it would go back to marry the Rose.
vein people to celebrate the candidacy of my av
my grandparents tried to hide my mother's supernatural powers,
but all knew them.
secretly, the people came to advise with her.

Clara...
... the fault was not yours.
you don't provoke the events...

only foresee them a little before they happen.
It is soon the Rose had to die in my place.

The revenge doesn't do well to anybody.
The revenge...
... he/she won't bring us the Rose of turn.
because I wrapped up in politics in this country?
don't pass of murderers and thieves!
My mother thought the Rose he/she had died for fault of her.
that if he/she spoke again, he/she could cause new accidents.
tormented for the displeasure and fault, maintained the silence.
never again decided to pronounce word.
Is it even true, Clara?
could not have waited for me, Pink?
for why didn't wait for me you?
if he/she knew that you would live so a little,
would have stolen to marry with you.
would have done you happy.
after leaving of speaking,
the mother started to live in an own world,
wrapped up in their fantasies,
in a world that escaped logical ã and laws of the physics.
enclosed for spirits of the air, of the water and of the earth...
becoming unnecessary for her to speak for many years.
