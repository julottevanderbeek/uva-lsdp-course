Only you
Can make this world
seem right
Only you
Can make the darkness bright
Only you
And you alone
Can thrill me like you do
And fill my heart with love
For only you
Baby, only you
Can make this change in me
For it's true
You are my destiny
Stop pushing it You're supposed to
let it happen, not force it
- I'm not pushing it You are
- I am not
You're doing it again
You're pushing it Stop it
Mom! Larry's pushing it!
- Larry, don't push it!
- I'm not it's moving itself
Wait
I have to write this down
Grandma said everyone has a soul mate
This way I'll know his name
The one I'm supposed to wait for
The one that'll wait for me
But, Faith, what if this guy
lived a billion years ago?
- What it he's a dead caveman?
- Don't be stupid, Larry
Soul mates are our destiny
They live when we live
What it he lives here in Pittsburgh
and you just pass him on the street?
It couldn't happen I'd know
Like when bees know how to make honey
And you'll know too
'cause you have one
We all do
Look
"Damon Bradley"
My other half?
My soul mate
She wants to know
it she's going to marry Alex
I do not!
He doesn't even have a brain
He's got pretty eyes That means
your kids would have pretty eyes
He can get a brain later
What do you think, Faith?
The most important thing is true love
isn't that right, Kate?
Look out below!
Larry, I hate you!
- Bill is gonna be so mad
- I know
Next
So, what destiny do you wish
from Madame Divina?
Just basic destiny stuff
I guess
But I don't want to hear anything bad
if that's okay
Something's coming to me
I'm getting a name
A name that is very important
David?
No
Damon
His name...
is Damon Bradley
Oh, my God
Your destiny is $200
The truth is...
you make your own destiny
Understand?
Don't wait for it to come to you
"From the Latin root destinare...
meaning, to have destination...
to journey...
to take a trip where the events
are totally predetermined"
Imagine that
The motion
of like attracting like
The motion
of a divine preordination
Okay Look
One hand, two hands
Put them together...
and what do they make?
One
Right! So, Plato tells us
we began in circles
When we strived to be like the gods
we were punished by a thunderbolt...
that struck us and cut us
right down dead center...
in half
We scattered
to the ends of the earth...
searching and searching...
for our other half
Now, what Plato was saying...
is that if we just stop...
and go with the flow...
and follow our destiny...
it'll lead us back to each other
Okay, so following through
on this...
read from your green book
Remember, one Wordsworth
one Keats or one Shelley
Have a great holiday
Don't get up, Leslie
I got everything
- Kate, did you want me to help you?
- Oh, no You might strain yourself
- I would've helped
- What is all this? What's going on?
Wine, candles
What is it?
He proposed
Faith, that's great
Did he get down on his knees?
Well, no
He turned down his beeper
He's a doctor He's practical
He doesn't have to get on his knees
Did you guys set a date?
Well, no I don't think
we should rush into anything
Let me see the ring
Where is it?
You don't have it on?
- I'm blind Oh, my goodness
- It's so pretty
Where are my sunglasses?
It's gorgeous
- I hate you
- Oh, my God
I asked him to give me 24 hours
to think about it
I'm never going
to get divorced, so--
I'm telling you
what I told him--
that I need time to reflect...
and that I'm going to say "yes"
I told my parents
I'm engaged
Oh, well
then it's official
- Dwayne What a catch He's a doctor
- He's so intelligent, Faith
- He's a doctor What do you want?
- Good sense of humor too
- He's got a mild sense of humor
- He's a doctor it's a tradeoff
He can't have a sense of humor too
He saves lives
He's a foot doctor
He saves feet
Feet are important
Plus, he's tall
Your kids will be tall
Yeah He's a sweetheart
You don't have to sell me on him
He's as good as gold
What is it you're waiting for?
I'm not waiting
Hey, Faith, grab me a beer
Faith, don't wait
You wait, you'll wind up with nothing
Oh, yeah Hi, Larry
Yeah, she's here Hold on
- My brother for you
- Uh-oh
Stop it
Don't eat my crust, Les
You still there?
I thought you'd be heading home by now
- I'm not I'm here
- What are you doing there?
Hanging out with your sister and Leslie
What is it? You miss me?
Yeah, my heart is breaking for you
Did you forget what night it is?
The guys are coming over
for poker
Oh I didn't know
you wanted me to play
Very funny Get home, make some
sandwiches and pick up some beer
This is my one night out
The kids are at Gus's
- Give me a break
- Kate, I still got lots of work to do!
Well, I've been in class
all day
Class?
The guys are gonna be there
without anything to eat!
I'm a woman, not a menu
All of a sudden
you're Helen Reddy
Get home!
You're gonna embarrass me
Fend for yourself
because I'm not coming home
I gotta go
What?
It's Ezio Pinza
Ezio who?
He was in South Pacific
with Mary Martin
Why don't they write songs
like this anymore?
I've gotta get going
No, no, no
You gotta stay and watch this
When you feel her call you
Across a crowded room
Then fly to her side
Saw a psychiatrist on Donahue say
that love songs are just a cruel hoax...
that feed people's fantasies
Romance on a daily basis?
Nobody has that
Yeah, but, Katy
somebody wrote those songs
They came out of
somebody's experience
No, I think they came out of
someone's imagination
Once you have found him
Never let him go
Once you have found her
Never
Let her
Go
Oh, my gosh
Wow
- Oh, look how it sparkles
- She's a beauty
Must've cost a lot
Yeah, I researched a lot of diamonds
and gemstones for this Learned a lot
It's amazing how many variations
there are...
of pure carbon
crystallized into octahedrons
But here's my real gemstone
right here
Sweet
- I know you don't like that I'm sorry
- That's okay is it all off?
- Yeah, I got it all
- Great
You've got to show this
to Aunt Gloria and Aunt Lil
They came all the way
from Pottsville
- May I see it one more time?
- Oh, Leslie!
Oh, my God!
It's the perfect size!
Come on, sweetheart
I feel like crying
- I have a headache
- Again?
Yes, but not
one of those headaches
I have 50 bobby pins
holding my hair together
What is this?
It's down Put it up
It's not exploitation
Everybody wants money, right?
That's what makes
this country great, doll
- Don't call me doll, okay?
- You used to love it
Well, you said it differently then
Faith?
- Faith
- Oh Yes
I wore it
my daughter wore it...
and I want you
to have the same joy
And I must say I was thrilled
when Dwayne said you would wear it
Dwayne?
- Where are you going?
- She's got another of her headaches
It's a bobby-pin headache, Mom
Talk to you later, Les
- We're going Can I have the keys?
- I've got the keys Let's go
Well, good night, okay?
Call me early
Faith, I gotta go
Call you tomorrow
- It would mean a lot to her
- It means a lot to me too, Dwayne
- She's not a young woman anymore
- She's already been married twice
Surely we can do this one little thing
for her Will you think about it?
- The thing is, you didn't ask me
- Oh, my God
Here comes your crazy uncle Pat
He wants to take another picture
- Ask me next time
- Let me fix your hair
- It's supposed to be like that
- There Now you're perfect
One more Good one
- Sorry I'm late, Faith
- Don't look!
Oh, dear Okay
Guess what I'm tree
My mom and dad took the kids
to the lake for Labor Day...
so I was running around
getting that stutf together
- Dwayne's not coming over, is he?
- No
He had emergency surgery
You can look
Wow!
Faith, that's a dress
I've decided it's romantic...
wearing the gown of the woman
who bore your husband
I mean, my daughter
will wear it too...
someday...
maybe... not
Wait a second
Put the veil on
It'll be okay
- Sweet of her, wasn't it?
- Yes
It I had this dress
I'd give it to someone
- I look like a muffin
- No, you look fine
Did it come with the soundtrack?
I think it's built in here
somewhere
There's probably
plenty of things
It's the thickness
We'll fix it Don't worry
I'll pin it a little bit
We'll see what we can do
- Life's not like it is in the movies
- No, it's not
Although from day one
everyone conspires to tell you it is
Your mother, your father
Teachers, priests, everybody
Dreams come true The good guy wins
People live happily ever after
All that crap
Then one day you wake up
and realize that...
your life should be...
different
Katy, dreams aren't crap
Okay, what about
unforgettable moments?
You can't tell me
you don't have...
one memorable
unforgettable moment...
because I know
you've had thousands of them
We're having one right now
I'm in my wedding dress
Those are the things to notice
Kate, what's wrong?
I don't know
Faith, I gotta talk to you
about something
What?
Larry and I, we're just--
I'm sorry
I have to answer
Dwayne's having his calls forwarded
Don't move
- Dr Dwayne Johnson, please
- He's not in at the moment
He's doing an emergency matrixectomy
Can I take a message?
- Who's this?
- Faith, his fiancee Who's this?
Hi I'm a high school buddy of Dwayne's

If he calls you once, he'll call back
- Get me out of this
- Hold on There's a million buttons
Whoa! Spin! Spin! Spin!
Jesus
Where are you going?
To the airport
Call a cab
- You can't just go to the airport!

It's a coincidence!
It is not a coincidence
You don't understand it's fate

Come on, Faith!
This is insane!
- Stop!
- Be careful!
- Oh, God
- Watch it
Good luck!
Sorry!

The man I was supposed to marry
is on that plane
I'm telling you

There is no such thing
as a coincidence
Kate, if I don't get on that plane
I am going to regret it
No, not today, but tomorrow
and for the rest of my life
It's Labor Day weekend

Thank you!
Okay, my passport's

Oh, yeah I'm crazy
Sorry
You can't go alone
What it you make a mistake
you'll always regret?
Do I need to remind you

Katy, look, I know you think
this is irresponsible...
but think how much more irresponsible
it would be...
to marry the wrong person
- I packed jeans and a dress
- God, I wish I had a passport
Excuse me
I also packed that little red dress
you never have the guts to wear
I got the blow dryer
Just get an adapter betore
you plug it in it could blow up
Why are we doing this?
It's insane
What it Dwayne and I aren't meant to be?
It's not fair for me to waste his life
She's right
What if he's really her soul mate?
He's not her soul mate
She's never even met this man
She's waited her whole lite for somebody
with a name she got off a board game...
when she was 11
You forgot about
the fortune teller
Okay, hurry, hurry, hurry
- We only got five minutes
- Oh, God
Bye, you guys
Have a good time

Small city

and found out where he's staying
Let's go, girls
You'll miss the happy day
We'll see him tomorrow
and be back the next day?
Exactly He's registered

appreciate it Thank you Damon Bradley

- Let's go Rome
- Rome?
Rome? Tomorrow?
Tomorrow is sciopero generale
Everybody will be on strike
Good luck
Everybody's on strike?
No planes, buses, trains?
Nobody shows up for work?
What kind of country is this?
The point is, we've been
on the wrong road for an hour
No, no, no
The point is, we're looping
We looped back around to that freeway
or turnpike or whatever they call it
- Which way do we loop?
- Right
Left Right
Kate!
I told you a liter
was less than a gallon
We would've had enough gas
it you hadn't gotten us lost
Besides, a kilometer
is less than a mile
Right Less than a mile
So we should have been able
to cover more of them
This is great
I wonder what time it is
in Pittsburgh
Sorry I got us lost
I'm sorry I'm so edgy
I'm afraid we're losing him
I didn't tell him I was going
to the lake with the kids
I told him
I was leaving him
Leaving him?
I think he's having an affair
- How do you know? Did he say something?
- No
- Did you see him with her?
- No
- How do you know?
- I just know
Kate...
remember in junior high
when I had that Halloween party...
and we all played Twister?
You started to tall...
and instead of taking the spot...
Larry reached out to catch you
He let you win
He never let anybody win
That's when I knew
he was head over heels
That was a long time ago
You know what I thought then?
I thought...
I hope someday I have somebody
who loves me that much
I know he loves you
I know he would kill tigers
for you
Okay, Mr Cronenworth
Let's check out this big guy here
He looks pretty good
This is a very simple procedure
Won't take but about five minutes
I'm just gonna make
a plaster mold of your foot
Dwayne, I gotta talk to you

- It'll just take a second Excuse me
- Where's Faith?
- At a teacher's conference
- Get out!
- Did she mention Kate?
- She talks about Kate all the time
- I think they're together
What?
Kate left me
I got home and there was a note
saying "I'm leaving" That's it
- No explanation, no nothing
- Jesus What happened?
She's been acting kinda weird lately
I should've seen it coming
Babbling on and on about communication
like I don't know how to communicate
Do you believe this woman?
I'm sorry
Sorry, Mr Cronenworth

In the shoe biz, the foot is our naked
canvas I could tell you some things

Not much for cross-training
I hope it brings you to whatever it was

I'm very real
What am I trying to think ot?
There's this poem by Goethe
Yeah, Goethe
It's about two people
who come from different places...
but they hear
the same bird singing
"Perhaps the same bird
echoed through both of us yesterday...
separate, in the evening"
That's it Exactly
Wow
Yeah it was Rilke
Rilke Oh
Well, same country
Right?
How'd you know that?
I could tell you some things
Some enchanted evening
You may see a stranger
You may see a stranger
Across a crowded room
I love trees
I could do nothing for the rest
of my lite, just grow trees
The ancients believed that gods
dwelled in them Did you know that?
Maybe they're watching us now
