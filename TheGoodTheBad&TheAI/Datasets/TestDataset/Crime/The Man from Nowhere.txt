Youngchul, the boy from rice shop,

Kids kept asking if I like him...

Oh! Look at my teeth. One of them feels loose.
Ever pulled your teeth?
Does it hurt alot?
Eh?
Mister?...
I knew it.
Why do I need to pull my teeth at this age...
I hate it...
Why is it 1,000?
You didn't pay me back 500 last time.

The songs are all weird.
That's mean.
Hey?

Eh? Sausage...
I like sausage, too you know.

Voila!
Open a nail art shop of my own. I'm the best in class.
Want your nails done?
Men are doing it these days, you know.
Were you a gangster?
People say you did something badand hides here.
Mom tells me to be careful causeyou might be a sexual offender...

I just thought you look good behind bars.
Jung Somee, are you in there again?- It's mom!...
I am not here, OK?
Mister!

Mister? Is Somee with you?
She isn't here.

Mister, what the hell are you doing?
Jung Somee, I'm going to give you a good whooping. if you don't come out right now!
What the..
She's really not here?
I'm warning you.
Don't ever ask my daughterinto your place?
If you ever do anything to Somee...
I forgive bastards who fuck married women.
But I'll never forgive bastards that touch children.
I will rip his balls off.
Well! If you're lonely, you couldask me out for a date, you know.
You don't look too bad.
I might even make love with you...
Right?
Chicken!
Beautiful, isn't it?
Don't touch the things that are not yours.
Are you smiling?
Tell your bossthat I will kill him once caught.
Day and night... have a fucking ball.
Fucking up the job that I ask you to do.
Think I'll ask someone else to get it back? You motherfucker!
I have guys out looking for it.
If I find out who fucked with me...- That's why I can't trust you guys...
Christ... look at those two for fuck's sake..
Who brought in that thick headed bastard?
Fucking Viet Cong.
and 11 million are doing Heroin.
Isn't that an outright bonanza? UN says so!
Three days!
I can only hold off the Chinese guys for three days!
If you can't retrieve the sample heroin...
You and your fucking brother will bein the "Human Body Revealed" exhibition for display.
Since you're into organs harvesting, you do know what I mean?
Only way for this country to do well is to put guys like you into a concentration camp just like the Kwangju massacre.
Fucking bitch!
Are you crazy?
Where did you stash the stuff?
Speak up?
I took the risk...
I'm entitled to half. right?
Fucking whore...
Listen, slut...!
My ass!
Who can find me if I sell it off and disappear?
You must be set on going to hell... Do you realise who we've fucked?
Think wisely. Stupid bitch.
Like mother, like daughter. Fuck!
Go play outside.
Really! I'll go home, once mom's friends are gone.
Do you know what your nickname is?
Pawnshop ghost.
Guess what mine is?.
What is it?
I won't tell you.
Garbage can.
My aunt told me that when my mom conceived me,
she kicked a garbage can and had her toe broken.
Since then, I am a garbage can.
Funny, isn't it?
Sleep.
A pawnshop ghost and a garbage can...
Sounds like some ID names on the net, isn't it?
Wish I could play a computer game.
"It had to be a rough job because of improper materials, Hope you'd be tolerant enough to find it cute"
What a naughty devil this is!
What's your mom's mobile phone number?
Answer me!
Oh... please stop hitting her. You may really hurt her.
Can't you see my child is hurt?
I am a taxpayer but what are you guys doing?
Allow begging kids like these wander round freely!
What's with the dirty look?
Your mother teach you to look at people like that?
Come here...
Did you steal that bag?
I didn't steal the bag..
I just wanted to see the difference from mine.
You don't have a bag, you beggar!
I told you not to touch her. She's full of germ.
Look. We need one of your parents to settle this.
Where's your mom?
Your dad?
Hey! Mister!
Mister!- Excuse me!
Hey!
Isn't he your dad?
Hello...
Where are you?
Judging from your voice, I had quite a beating...
Your brother went through the shitholewhile you're having a feast...
what an exemplary family it is, uh?
Easy does it... easy.
Life is simple, you know.
I got a call from Tochi. Find the bitch who siphoned our stuff.
Who?
The dancer?!
Are you mad at me?
Told you... you shouldn't steal.
How much for the stuff she just took?
Never mind...
Stealing is part of growing up.
Giving birth doesn't make one a parent. The poor thing is always alone by herself.
Like other dads, take her out with you more often.
Free, alright?
Give me back my MP3 player.
Since I don't have any money, I'll give you my treasure card.
It's my most precious possession.
Goodnight, sir.
Mister...
Mister, you're embarrassedabout me, aren't you?
That's why you pretended not to know me...
It's alright... My classmates feel thesame and so do the teachers.
Mom told me if I ever get lost,
I should pretend not to know ouraddress nor phone numbers.
Everytime she's drunk, she keeps sayingwe should kill ourselves together.
You are worse than the fat bitch who calls me a beggar.
Still, I don't hate you.
If I come to hate you, there won'tbe a single person I'd like more in this world.
If I keep thinking about that, it really hurts here.
So, I'm not going to hate you.
Mom?
Mommy...
We're looking for something, you know...
It's better you came to help us.
Fuck! You think I'm a two bit robber?
Go.
Got it?
That's... we may have a situation here.
Who are you, mister?
Don't think of robbing this pawn shop...
I didn't call police so just get lost.
Fuck! Ain't you a fucking cool...
Alright! If I have what belongs to me, I'll leave.
Something was pawned yesterdayby a bitch named Park Hae jung.
A camera bag. Give it to us.
Pawn shop takes half a month interest even for a day.
The principle 80,000 Won plus interest 1,600 Won. The goods are returned upon payment in person.

He was so quick. I couldn'teven see his hand move.
Hey, wasn't he some...
Forget it... Fuck!
Alright! Fine. I needed someone to take the fall anyway.
He didn't flinch...

He didn't flinch when I shot the gun.
So what!

Yes.
Is she really your neighbour?
Nevermind. State your address andwe'll have a nearest precinct contact you.

Shall I translate that?
You don't want to live?
Son of a bitch... afraid I might've poisoned it. Want me to drink it first, fine?

Keep your promise.
What the hell is he talking about?
Did you receive it?
Man Suk?
Are you trying to fuck me?
Should I just sit and watchthe business go down your throat?
You think you'd get away with this?!
Mr. Oh... Born in '58, year of the dog, Oh Myung Kyu, motherfucker.
Let me tell you this.
No matter how well you lick the assholesof prosecutors and judges,
You have 20 rounds with your name on it. Get it? Motherfucker?
If you value your life, you better start running, you stinking mongrel, motherfucker!
Stinking mongrel!

Son of bitches. Not even a single respond.- Got it.
No talking!
Don't swap your piss!
You've all heard it clearly. Understood?!
No organs?- Yes!
Cornea, kidney, liver, heart, subcutaneous tissues...
whatever that can be sold at high priceshave been completely taken out and emptied.
Organ harvesting is not Oh Myung Jyu's style...
Who the hell is he?
He popped out from nowhere.
We're checking his identity but so far nolinks with Oh Myung Kyu.
This was hidden inside the boiler.
Too little.
Already gone.

Name: Cha Tae Shik, Address: 21 Dongja-dong, Yong San-ku, Seoul
No drug charges. And negative on dope test.
Right! And this guy has norecords between '98 and '06...

Citizen registration cancellation is nothing new.
Start from last known record. Find the connection with Oh Myung Kyu.
Remember, it's a homicide.
Pawn shop?
A splotch was found inside this woman's nose
Understand what that means?
Her eyeballs were extractedwhile her heart was still beating.
She was alive when her eyeballs were gorged out, god damn it!
Understand!
Drug charges is not an issue here...
If you keep insisting on taking the fifth, you will rot in prison for good. Understand?
Do you...?!
Detective...
Don't we get night snacks?
What? Night snack?
Don't you fucking get it?
Who's Cha Tae Shik?
What is it?
I couldn't access his record. It was locked.
Locked?
Hey! This is the phone records betweenOh Myung Kyu and his associates.
Pass it to the captain and tell him to see me after he reads it.
He's still at the site andprobably won't be back anytime soon.
Damn..
Alright! Let's continue after meals?
Look...
I'm left-handed.
Alright! Hunger finally got to you, eh?
Now you'll talk, thank god!
That's the attitude!
Let's finish this quickly after eating, Okay?
Hello?

All I did was ask for a meal...
Where's detective Park?
Put detective Park on!

Young man.

Mom's up there?
You don't come up, you don't see your mom.
Open up, please
Grandma, please let me out.
Open up please.
Jun Ho got all his whole teeth broken.
Detective Kwon's knee joint got busted.
This man seems to be very mysteriousand well versed in close combat.
This bastard is fucking complicated.
The blocked code of lock on Cha Tae Shik'sbackground record was 011.
Guess what?
Military Intelligence...
Unless it's a political figure. I've never seenany civilian having his record locked.
It's fucking curious...
There's a way to break the lock, you know.
Wanna try?
Remember the short track Ono case?
An elementary school kid sent an email tothe president of U. S. A. stating inside...
I Kill You!...
Alarmed, the FBI requested a police investigation.
Naturally, guys with skeletons in theircloset will start to get nervous.
We'll use exactly the same tactic andsend a email in name of Cha Tae Shik.
If they request for our investigation...
Well, National Intelligence Service wouldn'thave any option but to declassify the information.
Obama... Obama?
Is Obama your friend, idiot?
We are just sending it to the white house.
Alright now... Go?
Stop?
Whatever it takes.
Don't kill me.
Don't kill me please.
That bitch... The fucking whore talked me into it...
That's how it got started...
Korean bastards only act when they are confronted...
It took the Olympics to have them build bridges and stadiums.
How could it possibly not collapse?
Oh... I just wanted to have some fun with the bitch. Nobody is behind this...
Son of a bitch.
Then where the fuck does the pawnshop guy fit in?
He's with you, isn't he?
What pawnshop?
Count to three.

P... p... please forgive me...
Two.
Please, please don't kill me. Please forgive me. Let me live, please. No... No.
Three!
You just frightened the shit outta me, god damn it!
Why the fuck waste time?
Dinner's here. Eat!
Would you please drop me a hint when you act, for god sake!
I just can't figure out where the pawn shop guy fits in?
Think about it. Why would he listen to usand not talk to the police?
Drop it... It doesn't matter. It's now our turf.
What about Oh?- He was sent to Namnang.
Alone?
It's a fucking brand new Dolceand Gabbana, for god sake. Damn it!
Alone again?
Yes.- I said don't let him act alone
That pervert just likes to play alone.
Let me live, please? This once, please let me live.
I'll pay you more thanMan Suk and Jong Suk. Alright?
Alright? Please spare me this once.
If we refine the philophon melt inside this,
We'll live like kings for the rest of our lives. Alright?
I got it! I finally figure it out!
The daughter of the killed woman. She was running errands for Cha Tae Shik.
The girl was here often.
I don't think there's any relationship betweenthe Park Hae Jung and Cha Tae Shik
Having the kid as a drug runner. Don't you think it fits?
Doesn't it sounds right? I've got it right?
So he cut up the womanhe was having a relationship with...
and pulled her eyeballs out?
Think Cha Tae Shik did all that?
No?
That girl called Somee. Any leads on her whereabouts?
