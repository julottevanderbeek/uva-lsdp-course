Hip-hop hooray, ho
Нey, ho
MALCOLM: Ijust read
that money as we know it
iS dead.
Soon the world
is only gonna buy and sell
products using bitcoins.
lt`s like a complicated
math equation.
So, one day we`re
gonna buy things
with numbers from
a math equation?
Dope, right?
NARRATOR:
Malcolm Adekanbi is a geek.
MaIcoIm Iives with
his single mother
and has only one memory
of his father.
MaIcoIm Iives
in lngleWood, California,
in the
Darby-Dixon neighborhood
referred to as the Bottoms.
You dreW
a picture of my morning
but you couldn`t make my day
l`m rockin` and you`re yawnin`
but you never look my way
l`m lickin` down your darlin`
ln every single way
Your funny flow is foreign
And your green
card`s on the way
This ain`t got
to do with shampoo
But watch your
head and shouIder
Brother, older, bold enough
To fold ya, yo, l told ya
A raid, afraid of what I made
and played it plus a funky fit
So save your fIips
And tricks for that
music and the monkey bit
Give me your bike, nigga!
NARRATOR: Malcolm`s friends,
Jib and Diggy, are also geeks.
Yo.
Shit.
All l want to do is
a zoom, zoom, zoom
and the boom, boom.
MALCOLM AND DlGGY: Word.
NARRATOR:
Malcolm, Jib and Diggy
are all deeply obsessed
with `90s hip-hop culture,
submerging themselves
in the music,
watching old
Yo! MTV Raps episodes
for fashion tips,
and using the slang.
Huh?
Bro, that shit
was whack.
What?
They were biting Brand Nubian.
That`s not
even possible.
Ah, jackpot, niggas.
Gushy, gushy.
Mmm.
NARRATOR: Oh, did I mention
that Diggy was a lesbian?
Although from the way
she dresses,
you might not have
noticed she`s a girl.
WOMAN: Save her, Lord !
MAN: Yo, hallelujah !
Hallelujah !
Every Sunday, her grandmother
asks the church
to lay their hands on her
in order to pray away the gay.
MAN: Praise the Lord !
MALCOLM: So, did it work?
You know.
l was watching
Justin Bieber
the other night
and l got a little moist.
Yeah?
So maybe.
That`s just because
he`s a little ho, though.
DlGGY: That`s true.
He`s a very pretty nigga.
JlB: Yes, he is.
What`s up, boss?
NARRATOR: For most geeks,
a bad day might be
being the butt of jokes
in class,
the occasional food prank,
and the worst,
being beat up by a jock.
But when you live
in the Bottoms,
a bad day might be
accidentally getting killed.
Like Wytony Johnson,
who got shot buying
a pastrami cheeseburger
from Jimmy`s Burger
on CentineIa.
Hey! lt`s the Rollin 60s,
dumb-ass niggas!
NARRATOR: The reaI tragedy is,
that he was seconds away
from defeating Ganon.
He had a heII of
a comic book coIIection.
Jib has been trying to
talk Wytony`s mom into
giving them to him
for the past two weeks.
Malcolm, Jib and Diggy
don`t play sports
and they aren`t in a gang.
They`re always
getting ridiculed
by their peers
because they`re
into white shit,
like skateboards,
manga comics,
Donald Glover,
and for listening
to white shit
Iike TrashTalk,
TV On The Radio,
and for doing white shit
like getting good grades
and applying to college.
Malcolm, Jib and Diggy
used to be in
the school marching band,
but quit in protest
after refusing to play
the HarIem Shake.
They arranged to use
the music room during lunch
for their recently formed
punk band, Awreeoh.
One, two. One, two,
three, four!
Yeah
First day of school
Hey!
Good grades are cooI
Trying to find
a new way to rule
And land a new major boo
My, my, is that why
Bumping young jeezy inside
I march to the beat
of my own drum
And tomorrow don`t care
about the outcome
lt`s time to get live, live
l mean fucking live
AdrenaIine on overdrive
Come on!
Life at home is
hard to survive
Come on, Jib!
Your friends come over
to give you a ride
Hey!
So hot,
you could evaporate rain
So much anger
but you don`t feel the pain
Then you say,
`sup with this?
Storm out of
the door and scream
Fuck this shit!
I won`t act Iike
a gangsta would
But no, you can`t
fuck with my hood
lt seems that lately
Your homeboy`s
tried to play me
Stay acting shady
My ego might just make me
Go ahead
Make some noise
Go ahead
Make some noise
Make some noise
Hey, hey! You know
the program, niggas.
Shoe program.
Turn around.
Let me see what the fuck
you working with.
Oh, shit, man.
All these motherfucker
s got small feet
around this bitch.
God damn !
Nigga, l don`t know
why you was looking.
Hey-hey!
My nigga, my G.
Oh, man.
Where the fuck
you goin`, man?
God damn !
What`s up with you?
Hey, them last shoes
you gave me, man,
l was feeling them.
Classics. The Force 2s?
Yeah, l was liking those.
What`s these you got on?
Bro, these are straight
from the flea market.
Shut the fuck up,
nigga.
These the J3s,
with the red mark
on `em.
Oh, yes.
Come up out
those right now.
Right now, nigga!
You speak English?
Do l gotta beat the shit
out of you again
and take them?
Damn.
This nigga`s speaking
African or some shit,
like he don`t
speak what we speak.
This nigga always. . .
Hey!
Go, Dig ! Come on !
Dig ! Go!
Come on, Dig !
Oh, shit!
Hey, hey.
Hold up, hold up.
Get your fuckin`
hands off me, man !
Don`t think l won`t
beat your ass, Marquis!
l came up with your daddy.
You better ask him
about Stacey.
And see what`s what
around this motherfucker!
Let`s go, man.
l`m gonna get
the other one, you little,
bitch-ass nigga.
Go, man.
Malcolm, when l see stuff
like this personal essay,
l think you`re not taking
the process seriously.
l`m. . . l`m taking it
seriously, Mr. Bailey.
l promise.
l`m talking about
something that l love.
l mean, it`s well-reasoned,
supported with
historical data,
it shows creativity,
critical thinking.
lf Neil deGrasse Tyson
was writing about lce Cube,
this is what
it would look like.
l suggest you go
in a different direction.
Write something
personal about you.
Your family, your life.
l mean, l. . . l could
write about the typical,
``l`m from a poor,
crime-filled neighborhood,
``raised by a single mother,
don`t know my dad. . .``
blah-blah.
lt`s cliché.
This here, this, this is. . .
This is creative.
This shows
that l`m different.
This is the kind of essay
that Harvard wants
from their students.
Malcolm, l`m gonna be
honest with you.
You`re pretty damn arrogant.
You think you`re gonna
get into Harvard?
Who do you think
you are, hmm?
You go to high school
in lnglewood.
To the admissions committee,
your straight A`s,
they don`t mean shit.
lf you`re really serious
about this exercise
and you`re not
just wasting my time,
or yours,
then it`s gonna be about
your personal statement,
your SAT scores,
your recommendations.
And most importantly,
your alumni
interview tomorrow.
Are you ready?
l`m ready.
You`d better be.
l just found out
you`re interviewing
with Austin Jacoby.
He`s from lnglewood too,
so he`ll be able to relate
to your circumstances.
Jacoby Check Cashing?
Harvard? Really?
l`m sorry. They don`t all
go on to be president.
NARRATOR: On this day,
their usuaI route home
is blocked by
a Blood gathering.
They were shooting a video
for their YouTube channeI.
Well, where do
you want to go?
Some nigga really
needs to invent an app
like Waze to avoid
all these hood traps.
NARRATOR: The onIy Way
to get home
is down 1 04th street.
But that`s where
the dope dealers are,
who, for sport,
routinely try to
steaI their bikes.
Go!
Hey, little nigga.
Such is the Iife of
a geek in the Bottoms.
Come here.
A daily navigation between
bad and worse choices.
Hey! Come here,
little nigga.
Yo, man.
l be seein` you
and your little friends
with y`all flattops
and MC Hammer pants,
riding around
in this shit,
looking like y`all came out
of a DeLorean or some shit.
Fuck is up with
that shit anyway?
You know, the `90s was like
the golden age of hip-hop.
Everything from
It Takes A Nation Оf MiIIions
to The Blueprint
was killing it.
l guess me
and my friends just wish
we grew up back then.
It Takes a Nation
came out in `88.
BIueprint came out 2001 .
What the fuck are you
talkin` `bout right now?
Technically, um. . .
But, you know,
the spirit of the music
was definitely still `90s.
l mean, It Takes a Nation,
Straight Оutta Compton,
Paid in FuII
was ahead of their time.
And then you got Snoop,
Biggie, Wu-Tang.
They took the game
to the next level.
BIueprint was kind of like
the punctuation mark.
Let`s not forget,
the `90s also gave us
Vanilla lce, MC Hammer.
And we can`t forget
about the Fresh Prince.
Everything in the `90s
wasn`t great, but. . .
Oh, shit.
But you gotta admit
Summertime was a classic.
What`s your name,
little nigga?
Uh, it`s Malcolm.
Look here, Malcolm.
l want you to do
a favor for me.
You see that green
apartment there in the
middle of the block?
There`s a nice
little piece over there.
l want you to go up to her
and tell her that
Dom wants to talk to her.
Uh, that`s. . . That`s it?
Yeah, nigga.
Can you handle that?
Uh. . .
Yeah.
Get to pedalin`, nigga.
Drop that up here.
Yeah.
You gonna say something
or just stare at me?
Um. . .
Dom says that he would
like you to come over
and talk to him.
Well, why don`t
you tell Dom that
if he wants to talk to me,
he can come over here
and be a fucking man,
and not send
a little kid
to talk for him.
Tell him just like that.
She said that shit?
And that Dominique
was way cooler
before he became Dom.
And, um, that if you
think that she cares
about your dope money,
she. . . She doesn`t.
Listen, tell her
that l`m throwing
a birthday party
at Verse tonight,
and l would really
enjoy the pleasure
of her company.
Go ahead, nigga.
You should, uh. . .
You should work
inside out.
Do the stuff
in the brackets first
and then square the sum.
Yep.
Okay. Thanks.
Oh ! Um. . .
Dom says he`s throwing
a birthday party
tonight at Verse.
Mmm-hmm.
He said he`d really love
the pleasure
of your company.
That nigga did not
say that.
He did. l. . .
l swear. He. . .
Lord.
Well, l`ll go if you go.
l`ll save you a dance.
JlB: You are going.
We are going.
She metaphorically showed
you her pussy and said,
``Come and fuck me.``
Jib, um. . .
JlB: Mmm-hmm.
. . .this is Dom
we`re talking about.
We`re not going
to a drug dealer`s
birthday party.
That`s. . . You`re trippin`.
We`re in our senior year,
bitches. Okay?
lt is time we started
expanding our horizons.
No.
Call your mom
and tell her you`re. . .
You`re studying late
at my place.
Come on. Dig? Huh?
Look, it`s better than
what you normally do
at night, so. . .
Mmm-hmm.
MAN:
Don`t stop, pop that pussy
Oh, hey, ladies.
Hey, ladies.
Oh, looking beautiful.
One, two and tres.
Been working on my spa. . .
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What you doing?
You let them in
without checking the list.
What`s up?
Okay, uh, let me
educate you real quick.
l am the gatekeeper,
l`m the grandmaster,
the authority
in keeping a proper
nigga-to-ho ratio.
You understand
what l`m saying?
So unless you little niggas
got some pussies,
l`m gonna need
y`all to get the fuck. . .
l have one.
l know y`all some bitches,
but you ain`t gotta
say you got pussies.
No, no, no, no.
She. . . She`s a girl.
What?
This little nigga`s a bitch !
Like. . . Like Boys Don`t Cry
like a motherfucker.
Remember when we
was seein` that shit?
Yeah, l remember that.
Nigga, what the fuck.
Let us in.
Oh, well, yeah, yeah.
You know, it`s 21 and older.
l`m gonna need some lD,
some verification.
Uh. Uh.
Aw, wait.
Y`all don`t have no lDs?
Sorry!
l`m gon` need y`all
to get the fuck off.
Come on.
Get the fuck off.
There`s a Baskin-Robbins
down the street.
Enjoy yourselves.
Hey, man,
don`t this dude look like
the dude that danced
in Santa Monica?
Breakdance?
Don`t he look like. . .
What the fuck.
You`re coming in, right?
BOUNCER: Get the fuck
outta here, man !
Get the fuck
outta here, man.
Old Coolio-looking
motherfucker.
Hey, baby.
You`re looking good.
WOMAN: Oh, thank you.
Digs. Digs. Digs. Jib. Jib.
Come on, come on.
Hey. Hey, Wait. . . Hey!
DOM: Yo, yo, yo. lt`s cool.
lt`s cool. Let `em in.
Look, l. . .
l can`t let you do that.
These kids are underage
and l cannot lose
my license tonight.
Not tonight.
l don`t mind having
this discussion with you.
l actually enjoy
the thoughtful
exchange of ideas.
And you do bring
up a valid point.
Know what l`m sayin`?
But see, you put me in
a bit of a spot, nigga.
`Cause l can`t have
you back-talkin` me
in front of my niggas
without at least
fuckin` your ass up.
You feel me?
Oh, look, you don`t
have to do that.
l kind of do though.
l mean, l don`t want to.
lt`s my birthday and shit.
But there`s principles
to this shit,
and l`m a principled man.
Hey, look, they in, Dom.
lt`s all good.
l know they got in.
That`s my point.
But l got this nigga
telling me what he
can`t let me do and shit.
Like l give a fuck!
Man, if l let this shit slide,
we got what they call
a slippery slope.
You know what
a slippery slope is, nigga?
No. l don`t. . . l don`t
know what a slippery. . .
Anyone?
ALL: Mmm-mmm !
Do it got anything
to do with skiing?
Nigga, sit your
ass down, man.
l know using your brain
is a challenge and shit.
You said slope,
you ski on a slope. . .
You might fuck around,
give yourself a concussion.
lt`s a small event that leads
to a chain reaction of events
with unintended consequences
that were unforeseen
at the time
of the inciting event.
See, this is
a smart little nigga
right in here, bro.
You probably got one of them
``photogetic`` brains
or some shit, huh?
You mean
photographic memory?
Nigga, what l just say?
l mean, yeah, you said it.
l`m reiterating that. . .
l`m still a little
shaky on the concept.
Basically, if l let
this nigga slide, man,
then l`m going to have
the next nigga coming along,
thinking they can
pop off and shit,
you know what l`m sayin`?
And so on and so forth.
MAN: Damn !
Oh, shit.
Hey, little nigga,
you coming in?
Yo, it`s cool.
You coming in, Malcolm?
Nigga, come on.
Yeah.
Nigga, school`s out.
What the fuck you
doing with a bag on?
Hey, throw this
behind the bar
for my little homey.
Yo, let me get
a round of shots.
Cheers.

DE`ANDRE: Boom !
Damn, nigga, that was ill.
This nigga doesn`t
know what hit him.
Check this nigga out.
He`s walking his
jihad dog and shit,
scratching his nuts.
Yahtzee, nigga.
Oh, this shit crazy.
Yo, man, straight up,
l really used to think
Obama was a bitch, man.
Drones, though, nigga?
That`s some gangsta shit.
l need one of
them motherfuckers.
That shit ain`t funny.
lt`s fucked up if you
really think about it.
How, nigga?
He killing all them
al-Qaidas and shit.
Nigga, that ain`t
all that gets killed.
And that nigga`s saying
he can
drone-strike Americans too.
They killed an American
working with them niggas
in Yemen.
Man, he was
a terrorist, dawg.
So it`s like set trippin`.
You can`t
decide to be a Blood,
and then get mad
if the Crips try to
kill you and shit.
Man, all l`m saying is,
this shit started
somewhere like Pakistan
or some shit.
And before you know it,
they`ll start saying
that we`re the terrorists.
They`re gonna have planes
riding all around lnglewood,
droppin` bombs on
Crenshaw and shit, man.
Ah ! Slippery slope.
DOM: Exact, nigga.
Shit, l wish a nigga
would try to fly
drones in my hood.
Fuck that.
Hell yeah.
MAN: l wish l would see
one of them motherfuckers
in lnglewood, man.
For real. Don`t let them
niggas come to my hood.
DOM: What you got there?
Breakfast club, nigga.
Molly Ringwald.
So, this the latest
and greatest shit, huh?
Yes, sir.
Pure as a nun`s pussy.
Know what l`m sayin`?
This ain`t like
that ghetto shit
y`all niggas been
fucking with either, man.
This is that A-1 shit.
Yeah, A.J. say
you ready to move out
the D-League
and move up to the NBA.
People want my power
And they want my station
Stormed my winter paIace
But they couldn`t take it
SWAT OFFlCER:
LAPD! Drop your weapons!
Oh, shit.
Whoo! Jesus!
Get the fuck out of here!
Let`s move. Go!
Tryin` to pull a full-on
Your gas won`t go
MALCOLM: Nakia! Nakia.
Lookin` for your ticket
Now let`s all go
Are you all right?
Yeah, l`m fine.
Malcolm !
Shit.
Come on. l drove.
Thanks for helping me.
Most of those niggas
just saw me and
stepped over me.
Luckily for you, l`m not
one of those niggas.
Oh, really?
What are you, then?
l don`t know.
l`m just. . .
l`m black as fuck, right?
l guess l`m just
used to hearing that
niggas don`t listen to this,
niggas don`t do that,
niggas don`t go to college
unless they play ball
or whatever.
lt`s just time to accept it.
l`m just not
one of those niggas.
Well, me neither, then.
`Cause l`m going to college.
Just gotta get my GED first.
That`s what
you were studying for.
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
lf l pass, l`ll go to
El Camino or Santa Monica
or something.
Transfer to Dominguez
or Northridge.
Well, you shouldn`t
sell yourself short.
You could do better.
You hardly know me.
So how can you say that?
l can just tell.
You shouldn`t settle
for what`s expected.
Like Dom, right?
l. . .
l didn`t say that.
Don`t try and be slick.
You`re trying to
block him.
So, you two. . .
You guys. . .
lt`s complicated.
But trust me,
he`s got nothing on you.
You probably got
all the girls lined up
asking you to prom and shit.
You making fun of me?
No, no.
l`m sorry.
Hey, l didn`t go
to my prom.
You didn`t go
to your prom?
Seriously.
l had one guy ask me.
Anthony Davis.
And he fucking stood me up.
l didn`t even care
about missing prom.
l was more mad about
not going to Six Flags
the next day.
All my friends had dates.
l didn`t want to go alone.
Would you want to
go to prom with me?
l mean, l. . .
l know that l`m not
complicated or. . . But. . .
lt`s just with
studying and all,
l don`t think
l`ll have time.
But thank you.
What if l helped you study?
And what if
you passed the GED?
Would you go with me then?
l`ll think about it.
Okay.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
JlB: Three Words.
Did you fuck?
Oh, man,
you`re a pussy, nigga.
Come on, man.
She let me feel her titties
and finger-bang her.
Bullshit.
No, l`m dead-ass serious.
Smell my fingers.
l don`t smell shit.
Yeah !
Just cream.
You never
smelled pussy before.
Wait. l have.
l don`t smell shit.
See, she don`t
smell shit either.
`Cause you only
know your pussy.
Exactly!
Wait, wait, wait. Hold it.
Whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.
You two go back through,
one at a time.
One at a time.
What`s getting into you?
Come on.
Hey, hey. Calm down.
Go. Everybody else wait.
Turn around, go back.
We gotta do pat-downs.
The machine is broke.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit! Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Yo, yo, yo.
Oh, shit!
What`s wrong? What?
Oh, shit.
Fuck!
ls that real?
Boy, how`d you
get this shit?
l have no fucking clue, Jib.
No fucking clue.
What do you mean
you don`t have
a fucking clue?
l have no fucking clue
where that gun came from.
Or the drugs.
SWAT OFFlCER:
Drop your weapons!
Oh, shit.
Get the fuck outta here.
Let`s move. Go!
Last night at
the fucking party.
At the party.
Dom put that shit
in my bag. Had to be.
JlB: Well, we gotta
get rid of it, then.
You know? Dump it, or. . .
Yeah.
Or take it to the police.
Yeah. Let`s take it
to the police.
Are you joking?
You want three niggas
to take a bag full of dope
and a gun to
the fucking police station?
Like, ``Here you go``?
l. . .
And you don`t expect Dom
to find out who snitched?
Well, what do you
wanna do with it?
Yo, that`s a lot of weight.
lt`s like 20, 30 keys.
l don`t know.
lt`s a lot of shit, right?
l don`t know, Dig.
l don`t know
anything about this shit.
All l know is
Jeezy paid LeBron
and Jay paid Dwyane Wade.
What?
He was talking
about dope?
Shit.
l answered it.
MALCOLM: You did what?
l don`t want that shit.
DlGGY: Oh !
Shit.
Hello?
THE VOlCE:
Who the fuck is this?
Um, who is this?
This the nigga
that`s gonna fuck you up,
you keep asking questions.
Now, who the fuck is this?
l prefer not to say.
Оkay, I see how we
gonna do this, then.
If this ain`t
a nigga named Malcolm
at Yukon and 1 04th street,
then l`m gonna kill your ass.
How do you know

Otherwise, click-click-boom.
Damn right. Damn right,

You`re right.
Your lunch. lt`s right here.

CooIio.
Now, after school,

a red EI Camino parked,
and this
handsome-ass nigga inside.
That ain`t Lance Gross, nigga.
That`s yours truly.

You have a nice,
happy, productive life
with a heII of
a story to tell.
You got it?
Yeah. Yeah, l got it.

It`s almost over,
little nigga. You did good.

Yo, he`s over there.
MALCOLM: Where?
DlG: To the right.
MALCOLM: Oh, l see him.

Yeah. Yeah, let`s go.
You good? All right.
Yeah.
He asked for you alone,

You`re just dropping it off.
You`re good.
He`s good. He`s good.

Who`s this?
This is Dom, man.
Look, do you have
what l left in the backpack?
Yeah. Yeah.
You in the red El Camino?
What the fuck

Somebody called me earlier
saying l need to
bring him the sandwich.
Nigga, why the fuck
are you talking about
sandwiches right now?
The. . . The backpack.
He. . . The guy, he said
that l needed to bring
it to him after school.
He`d be in
a red El Camino.
Yo, McFly,
l want you to listen
to what l`m about to
tell you right now.
Somebody snitched.
l`m in county right now.
I don`t know

There`s two possibilities.
Either the motherfucker
in the El Camino is po-po.
As soon as you
give him the package,
he gon` arrest you.
Оr that
motherfucker`s the snitch.
In that case,
he`ll take the package,
kill you,
then I`m headed to Chino
with a price on my head.
Look, l`m gonna
need you to trust me
right about now,
you understand?
Do not take that
backpack to the nigga
in the whip,
eIse we both fucked.
Hear me?

Tell him it`s about
the boys club.

JALEEL: l fuck around
with it, you know.
l do my little thing.
My style is, l`m like
a Dilla meets a No l. D.
with a little bit of
splash of Rick Rubin.
Right.
Know what l mean?
l actually got
something that l did
the other day.
Check this out.
Yeah,
ridin` in my whip
Left on lmperial
Hos trying to milk a nigga
Just Iike bereaI...
Wait. ``Bereal``?
Yeah, what the
fuck is ``Bereal``?
Oh, shit. Look.
l meant ``Cereal.``
But that`s how much l
hate crab-ass niggas.
You know what l mean?
`Cause my mind,
it thinks these C-words,
but my mouth won`t
let me say them.
Okay, so, you replace words
that start with C`s with B`s?
Like Crip dyslexia.
Criplexia.
But only soft C`s,
`cause you said
``Crab`` no problem.
That`s true.
Why won`t your mind
tell your mouth
to say ``Brab``
instead of ``Crab``?
l don`t know.
lt`s a case-by-case thing.
Not
``Base-by-base``?
See, you would think
this hard ``C``
would be the issue,
but no.
That`s interesting.
Fuck y`all. l`m just tryin`
to rep my set. That`s it.
Ladera
doesn`t have a set.
What the fuck you mean?
Huh? Does that make me
any less of a nigga
than y`all?
ALL: No.
Because my dad was
from the Bottoms.
Yeah.
My uncle, everybody
on my side reppin`
the lnglewood family.
`Cause that`s
where my heart is.
MALCOLM: Yeah.
Even though my. . .
My body`s right here.
MALCOLM: Mmm-hmm.
lt`s cool.
lt`s ``Bool.``
Fuck all y`all.
`Cause l was in a good mood
and shit, all right.
Can`t
bring me down
Оh-ay-oh
What was that?
A song that we. . .
You just reminded us
of something we was writing.
``Was``? Let`s. . .
Let`s get to it.
What you mean?
Let`s record.
Let`s record what?
The song.
Quit fucking around.
Come on.
I`m eating good
Оh-ay-oh

Ooh ! Can she cook

Chili-cheese fries. Yeah.

Right?
Where you get `em at?
Jimmy`s Burgers

Yes, um, cuatro órdenes

Niggas, let`s roll.
You coming, Malcolm?
No, l think

I`m your drug, baby
Come and take a dose of me
So, you`re a boy
from the hood?
Good thing you found
the boys club
and have such
an amazing mentor
as my father.
l`m bored as fuck.
Will you play with me,
my little boy from the hood?
Yeah.
Yeah, we. . .
l can. . .
Well, what do you
want to play?
How about we play
Mother May l?
You remember
that game, right?
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Ask me a question.
Um. . .
What`s your name?
Lily.
No, you`re supposed to
ask me something like,
``Mother, may l
take two steps?``
lf l say yes, you take
two steps toward me.
Or l may say,
``No, you have to take
three steps back.``
Now it`s my turn to
ask the questions.
Okay.
Got it?
Yeah.
May l take off
my clothes?
Yeah.
May l walk over to you?
Yeah.
May l touch you?
Yes.
Are you a virgin?
No.
Don`t.
Don`t do that.
There are too many liars

you`re not like that.
Not like him.
Don`t start now, okay?
Okay.
Yes, l`m a virgin.

RECEPTlONlST:
Mr. Jacoby`s just wrapping up
a staff meeting.
He`ll be a few minutes.
MALCOLM: Dom?
ls that. . . ls that Dom?
Oh, shit.
Austin Jacoby.
Nice to meet you,
Malcolm.
Take a seat.
Come on, relax.
So, uh,
Malcolm Adekanbi.
Did l pronounce that right?
Yeah? Great.
You`re Nigerian.
My dad, um. . .
He. . . He went
back to Nigeria
before l was born.
Sorry to hear that.
l know what it`s like
to grow up without a father.
That`s why l spend
a lot of time
and a lot of money
with the boys club.
Those, uh, those kids. . .
Are they your kids?
Yes, they are.
Not too much older
than you.
So you know Dominique?
Excuse me?
You. . . You probably
know him as Dom.
No. Sorry.
Why do you ask?
Dom gave me something
to deliver to someone.
As crazy as it seems,
l think that someone is you.
This Dom person,
what did he say that
l should have to do
with this delivery?
l don`t know.
l just know that he told me
to deliver it to A.J. , so. . .
And why did you do it?
l didn`t have a choice.
Oh, come on, Malcolm. Come on.
You always have a choice.
You could have done
a lot of things
with that package.
You`re a smart kid.
l`m sure you thought
about all of them.
But you chose to
make the delivery
for this Dom person. . .
Because you thought it was,
what, in your best interest?
So, you should
take responsibility
for the choice
that you`ve made.
Now, you know l`m not
the person or persons
for whom this delivery
was intended.
Something happened
along the way.
lt`s like, uh, Amazon.
lf you order a Rick Ross
or Macklemore CD. . .
l would not order
a Macklemore CD.
That wouldn`t happen.
All right. Who, then?
Casey Veggies.
Casey Veggies?
That`s. . . That`s an artist?
Yeah.
Yeah, okay. All right.
So, you order
a Casey Veggies CD
from Amazon, right?
No, you don`t order
a Casey Veggies CD.
You just go online
and you download it.
Yeah, okay. All right.
But you are aware
that Amazon does
ship discs, right?
And if you
order that disk
and it does not come
in a timely fashion,
you`re gonna call them
and you`re gonna say,
``Where`s my stuff?``
And Amazon has to
assume responsibility.
But it`s just one CD.
But what if it`s 1 00 orders
and 1 00 CDs don`t show up?
Or a thousand? Or 1 0,000?
lt`s a slippery slope.
Slippery slope.
So, Amazon has got to assume
the full cost of the loss.
But most importantly,
they have to deal
with the loss of
their reputation.
A reputation that has taken
a long time to build.
You understand
what l`m saying?
So let`s do this.
Let`s reschedule
this interview
for a few weeks from now.
Give it a little time.
Go out there.
Make the delivery
for which you have
claimed responsibility
to the appropriate
consumers,
so that the suppliers
of this product can be whole.
Metaphorically speaking,
of course.
lf you`re able to do this,
it shows me more about you
than any interview ever could.
And l would then
make it my business
to make you a man of Harvard.
AUSTlN: I Want you to
get out of the Bottoms
just like l did.
l know from growing up there,
it`s very, very dangerous.
And that your family
or your friends
could get killed
at any moment
just by being in
the wrong place
at the wrong time.
l`d hate for that
to happen to you. . .
Оr any of your famiIy members.
Getting on?
Looks like you and l had
the same kind of day.
How`d the interview go?
Okay.
Well, sit down.
My shift`s almost over.
l`ll take you home.
MALCOLM: Thanks, Mom.
A junkie
walking through the twilight
l`m on my way home
l left three days ago
But no one seems
to know l`ve gone
Home is where the hatred is
Home is filled with pain
And it might not be
such a bad idea
If I never
Never went home again
Tried to heaI
my broken heart
And it might not be
such a bad idea
If I never
lf l never went home again
Home again, home again
Home again
Kick it, quit it
Kick it, quit it
Kick it, quit it, kick it
Can`t go home again
Home again, home again
WOMAN: The incident
took place today at
Seven Bucks coffee,
apparently the side effects
of the popular club drug
MDMA, or ``Molly.``
TannehiII James was a witness
to this bizarre scene.
So, I`m here at
the Seven Bucks,
drinking my
vanilla chai latte,
and eating me
some pound cake.
`Cause you know niggas
don`t eat scones, right?
When all of a sudden,
this crazy little
naked ho comes up,
and she squatted down
right in front of me
and she pissed right there.
I swear to God.
Pissed right there
for a long time.
So, now, you teII me
how am l supposed
to eat my pound cake
after witnessing
something like that?
WOMAN: Reporting live,
Karen Myetta, ChanneI 1 0 news.
MALE ANCHOR: Up next,
a fight over lunch turns
deadly in lnglewood.
Did he actually say,
``l`ll kill you
``and your friends
if you don`t sell
these drugs``?
Or just you? What?
Don`t act like
you weren`t curious, too.
Not directly.
He was talking about Amazon
and Rick Ross CDs
not getting to
their customers.
Niggas don`t even
buy CDs anymore, dawg.
Jib, that`s not
the fucking point!
Are you gonna go
and sell on the corner?
`Cause we`re
a bunch of bitches, man.
Speak for yourself, Jib.
Yes.
l am a bitch-ass nigga.
l don`t give a fuck.
l own that shit.
Who are you trying
to impress, Diggy?
We`re talking
about Molly, Jib,
not fucking heroin.
All we gotta do is
find the white people.
Go to Coachella,
Lollapalooza.
Yeah, yeah.
We can backpack
and hitchhike
and sing
Mumford & Sons songs
and all that
folk fucking shit.
Fuck you. Okay?
l`m just saying
it could work.
JlB: Yeah, yeah.
Why stop there, you know?
Why not hit Bonnaroo also?
MALCOLM: Bitcoins.
That`s how we do it.
DlGGY: Do what?
Oh, shit.
There`s these sites
where you can. . .
You can sell everything
from fake credit cards
to illegal guns and drugs.
And they use bitcoins
so they can`t be traced.
We don`t have to
stand on any corner.
Dark web. Could work.
Way better than Coachella.
Guys, the FBl can track us.
The police. . .
No, they can`t.
Uh-uh.
Not if you use
a Tor browser.
What the fuck is that?
Onion routing.
Layered encryptions.
lt`s like a game
of Whac-a-Mole
with thousands
of computers.
What the fuck
is a Whac-a-Mole?
Look, these dark web sites
run off these
secret lP addresses.
Like LulzSec-level shady.
We need to find one somehow.
We be to rap
What key be to lock
NARRATOR: William
Ian Sherwood III.
Musician, scholar,
rake, entrepreneur,
conspiracy theorist.
But
I`m cooI Iike dat
I`m cooI Iike dat
I`m cooI Iike dat
I`m cooI Iike dat
I`m cooI Iike dat
I`m cooI
NARRATOR: MaIcoIm,
Jib and Diggy
met WiIIiam at Band Camp
three years ago.
Yo, if you niggas
need some weed,
l got you. Good shit.
Fair prices.
NARRATOR: William assured
them that he the used
the word ``Nigga``
only as
a term of endearment,
as expIained by Q-Tip
in the classic song,
Sucka Nigga.
That`s your room
right there.
NARRATOR: After that,
they all hit it off.
Though he never used that word
in front of them again.
The mission at Band Camp
was to give kids from
different backgrounds
a chance to exchange
music and experiences
unique to their cultures.
Wait. Okay, so you`re saying
white girls will suck dick,
yet still claim
they`re virgins?
Yeah, man.
l`m serious.
Really?
Dude, check it.
l`ve been getting head
since l was,
like, 1 2, all right?
l`ve been
hitting hos in the ass
since l was, like, 1 4.
lt`s true, man.
These chicks will
let you fill any hole,
except the pussy,
with a dick, no problem.
So, technically,
you`re still a virgin too.
Yeah.
Right.
But here`s something to
wrap your brain around, man.
l`ve never
had intercourse
with a pussy.
JlB: Mmm-hmm.
Only asshole
and oral. Okay?
JlB: Mmm-hmm.
So the question isn`t,
``Am l technically a virgin?``
What the question
could be is,
``Am l technically gay?``
Oh. That`s deep, nigga.
Yeah. l don`t know.
NARRATOR:
WiIIiam went to
prep schooI,
where he smoked
a pound of weed a week,
skipped classes,
and had a 1 .9 GPA,
yet got a perfect
score on his SAT.
He was accepted to
his father`s aIma mater
under academic probation,
which meant he had to maintain
a 3.0 grade point average.
So, William hacked
into the  database,
erasing all grades
from the entire
freshman cIass.
We out
Small-batch, craft-brewed,
It ain`t
nothin` Iike that
NARRATOR: That same year,
he achieved his dream
of having sex
with a black girl.
You ever fucked
on Molly before?
No.
Hey, nah,
it`s good, man.
lt`s like. . .
lt`s like being
fucked by God.
I`m nojoke
when I stroke for a cIient
You know,
everybody is going to
Black Market Reloaded
and a bunch of
smaller sites.
But, dude,
that shit is getting
mad sketchy now.
lf you nigga. . .
lf you guys want drugs,
l can get you good shit
way less expensive
than online.
Nigga, we don`t
need to buy anything.
We need to set up
a store to sell.
What? Nah, really, dude.
What can l get you, man?
l`m dead-ass
serious, nigga.
Dead-ass serious.
Okay.
Okay.
All right. Wait.
`Cause this is
ridiculous, man.
Why the fuck,
after all these years,
you can call me N-word
and l can`t say it?
Yo, look, we already
went over this.
l`ll have to slap
the shit out of you again.
l don`t want to do that.
See, that`s not even right.
l mean, like, really.
You know l`m not
the one, all right?
This is all love here.
Look, let`s. . .
Let`s get back.
Hey, you asked me to
do something for you.
l`m like, ``What?`` l`m down.
l don`t give a fuck.
Because you`re my people,
all right? You`re my n. . .
And this is where
l would insert that word.
lt`s nothing personal.
You`re still my nigga.
But l gotta slap
the shit out of you
based on principle.
Let`s get back to
what`s goin` on.
No, no, no. Wait. Principle?
Okay, you want
to talk principle.
What about Jib here, man?
This dude isn`t
African-American.
He`s like fucking Latino
or Moroccan or some shit.
MALCOLM: Where`s this
conversation going?
Technically, he shouldn`t
be able to say the word.
Why can he use it?
Okay. Because
l`m 1 4% African.
Four. . . 1 4?
That doesn`t. . .
Shit, l`m probably 1 4%.
l am 1 4% African.
Ancestry.com.
Look, we don`t give a fuck.
For real?
Just say the
damn word, okay?
lt doesn`t matter.
lt`s cool, right?
l don`t give a shit.
DlGGY: l give a fuck.
Don`t say that shit.
l will slap the shit
out of you.
No, no, no. No, you won`t
because you have been
outvoted by your peers.
l`m George W. Bush.
l don`t give a fuck
what the vote says.
Dig.
What the fuck?
Let him say it.
All right, you can say it.
Thank you.
And l appreciate that.
l really do.
Now, like a nigga
was saying. . .
What the fuck!
WlLL: What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Yo, it was a reflex.
Reflex?
A fuckin` reflex?
Dig !
lt won`t happen again.
l`m sorry.
Look. Will,
we need your help
to sell this shit.
That`s why we`re here.
Whoa. How did
you guys get this?
lt`s a long story, man.
We need to know
if you`re gonna
help us.
Why? l mean, you guys
could set that type
of shit up easily.
Nah, nigga, not like you.
Okay?
l need to go ghost.
None of this shit
can point back to me.
The type of protection
l need for this shit
requires a hacker.
Anon shit.
You broke into
the fucking USC database.
Hey, hey. No,
no, no. Okay?
Samo did that.
l don`t know shit,
all right?
Whatever, nigga.
Look, we don`t know
shit about selling dope.
Nothing.
Nothing about the units,
the terminology,
the pricing.
None of that shit.
l don`t even know how much
this fucking bag is worth.
You do.
Okay.
But if this is
a Samo-type job,
man, l can`t just
do this as a favor.
What do you want?
A percentage
of the profits?
Fuck that.
Pay me in Molly.
SIam!
Cut up the shit.
You`re gonna want
to measure it out. . .
So you can
bag it up in grams,
sell it that way.
But, you know,
what a lot of the kids
are liking nowadays
is the pill form.
Da-duh-duh
Let the boys be boys
Slam, da-duh-duh
Da-duh-duh
So, where we
setting up shop?
Here.
Here?
Yeah. Here.
Are you fuckin`
retarded?
No. lt`s actually
genius, bro.
MALCOLM: We have
a science Iab.
We want to enter the
Google Science Fair.
All we need you to do
is open up the science labs,
and we can do
everything else.
WlLL: Don`t lose
that shit, okay?
MALCOLM: We have
a computer lab which
nobody ever uses.
I`m eating good
Can`t bring me down
MALCOLM: And all the supplies
laying around the band room
would be perfect
for shipping.
Can`t bring me doWn
And the best part,
watch.
Can`t
bring me down
Oh-ee-oh
But not them probably
bIack on the outside
White in the middIe
I want to feeI Iove
l want to just giggle
Nobody`s going to
suspect a thing.
We`re just geeks
doing what geeks do.
l`m eating good
Right? That`s what
l`m saying, bro.
You`re into it, bro.
Can`t bring me down
What`s up?
Yo.
What`s up?
Hey, congratulations
on getting the store set up.
Now, uh, we gotta
get you guys some
customers, right?
Yeah.
Check it out.
My house is having a party.
We couId use a cooI band.
Who thejiggy nigga
with the gold links?
Okay. Say we`re, like. . .
What about
if you`re quoting,
like, rap lyrics?
Say we`re all listening
to The Chronic, DoggystyIe.
We`re all rapping along.
Like, what are we
supposed to say?
`Cause
l never hesitate to put
an N-word on his back
l`m sorry.
That`s bullshit, dude.
Yes.
What about
the artist`s intent?
Dude, that is exactly
what l`m talking about, man.
Dude, l saw your bitch,
Lily, on YouTube.
Okay. Well, Lily is not
my bitch anymore, so. . .
Hey, then can l
get at her, dude?
`Cause l gotta find out
what she was on.
Nigga, l don`t give
a fuck. All right?
Go for it, dude.
Hey, but for real,
she was using this.
MALCOLM: Um...
Mike check.
One, tWo. One, tWo.
Um, hi.
I`m MaIcoIm Ad-rock
on guitar.
We`ve got Diggity Diggy Dawson
on the drums,

SteeI-faced BobbIehead Jibby

MAN: Play something,
Fresh Prince!
All right.
We are Awreeoh.
We`re about to
turn it up, okay?
One, tWo.
One, two, three, four.
MALCOLM:
You keep jumpin` around
in my face, you know
Yet you hang around
you see every show
But you just make me weak
l`m about to explode
What the fuck?
Fight one little
monkey critical
Put you out with the rest
of the shit to go
Yeah
You tried my patience
`Cause I`m so nice
You think it`s safe, yeah
My adrenaline is racing
You may not
see it in my face
But don`t mess with me
I`m not in the mood, dude
Don`t mention me
I`m not in the mood, dude
Ain`t got an attitude, dude
l`m just not in the mood, dude
I ain`t do nothin`
to you, dude
I don`t deserve it
Don`t need it
Don`t get deleted
Bitch, don`t get deleted
Yeah, don`t get deleted
Bitch, don`t get deleted
Diggy, Diggy, Diggy!
Don`t get deleted
Don`t mess with me
I`m not in the mood, dude
Yo, fuck Molly, dawg!
lt`s all about that Lily, son!
How am l supposed to eat m...
Pound cake?
Eat my pound cake.
My pound cake!
Is this ChanneI 1 0?
You`re all out here, huh?
Hey, homey,
videotape this.
I want to tweet
this later, man.
Yeah, don`t get deleted
Son of a bitch.
We got an order.
``Lily?``
Don`t get deleted
l can`t believe
we`re really doing
this right now.
Shit.
SmiIe on my face
but distrust beIow
Don`t let it fool ya
Far as dressing go
Okay. Let me. . .
No.
CongratuIations
You`re about to go, yeah
This shit

Bitch, don`t get deleted
Yeah, don`t get deleted
Oh, shit.
Put it on eBay
Fuck this up
Lily, dude, that
was unbeIievabIe.
Principal Harris
tells me that
there are
three young men. . .
who actually joined
the Google Science Fair.
Please.
Proof
that the public school system
is still a ladder to success.
MALCOLM: Half an ounce
for Joe Patterson.
We have an ounce
for John Smith.
We have an eighth
for Ashley Down.
Susan Thompson.
JlB: Steve Burke.
MAN: Yeah, this popped up
about a few weeks ago.
Look at what
they`re moving.
lt`s major volume, too.
l don`t know why they`re
calling it ``Lily.``
Maybe, uh, 2 Chainz
called it that on a mixtape.
He`s a rapper.
Yeah, you know,
the Birthday Song.
``Big booty ho.``
Okay, never mind.
Forget it.
Hi.
Um, is that offer
still on the table?
Help.
lf you`re busy,
l can come back
tomorrow or later.
No, um, no. They`re. . .
They`re about to leave.
DlGGY: Yeah.
Yeah, we were
stepping.
Okay, cool. Thanks.
Bye. Bye, guys.
Have fun.
WOMAN:  They say
one door open
When another door cIose
l`m prayin`
That`s the way
that it goes
`Cause right
when I`m about to
Turn the doorknob
Thanks for helping me.
No problem.
You`re a fast learner.
Aw.
Thanks.
Shit`s been real crazy
since Dom got locked up.
A few of his boys got
smoked on the corner
the other day.
l don`t want
to go back there.
Sorry. l just don`t
have people
l can talk to
about this stuff,
that understand,
you know?
l know.
Thanks.
Dom called from jail
the other day.
He asked about you.
That`s why you showed up
all of a sudden.
What`s that
supposed to mean?
lt means that
Dom sent you here
as his messenger.
All this crying on
my shoulder? Bullshit.
You`re supposed to put
your feminine wiles on me,
and find out about
the fucking dope.
Right?
Wait. l. . .
And here l was,
stupid enough to think
that you were different
than these other niggas.
Nakia, Nakia, Nakia.
Fuck you !
``Feminine wiles``?
PROCTOR: Good morning.
Today you`re going to
take the SAT.
The SAT is your chance
to show how prepared
you are for college.
You will have 25 minutes
to work on section one.
Yo, what the fuck was that?
What do you mean,
you don`t know?
Drug search, dawg.
They do it randomly,
like, every month or so.
lt`s all for show.
l mean, it`s not
like somebody
is stupid enough
to put some shit
in their locker.
Can l go to the bathroom?
Yes, but you will
not be given more time.
MAN:
Without a pause,
l`m lowering my level
The hard rhymer
where you never been l`m in
You want styling
You know it`s time again
``D`` the enemy
Telling you to hear it
They praised the music
This time they play the lyrics
Some say no
to the album, the show
MAN 2:
Hey, yo, Chuck
They think we takin` shorts
Show `em
This is cold medina,
man come on, kick it
MAN:
Terminator X
Terminator X
Man.
Come on, man.
What in the hell
are you doing?
Um, SAT`s.
SAT`s?
l, uh, had to use
the restroom,
and l`m kind of late
getting back.
You know?
Thank you.
Good luck, little man.
MAN:
Bring that beat back!
One, two, three, four!
Hit it!
The set ain`t over!
Come on, y`aII
Let`s get busy
Come on. Say ``Yeah!``
Say ``HeII yeah!``
Ain`t it funky?
JIB: l`m not doing
this shit no more.
Bro, l can
fix this shit.
l can
fix this shit.
The bag is almost done.
The shit is almost gone.
l mean, l can`t sell
this shit no more.
We almost just got
fucking caught.
Look, l don`t want
to go to jail.
l want to go to
fucking college.
l want to get a good job.
l want to help my mom !
Dig?
That`s cool.
lt`s my fault,
my weight to carry.
Yo, that`s bullshit.
We all wanted to
go to Dom`s party.
Especially you, Jib.
lt`s our weight
to carry too.
We`ve got your back
to the end, right?
Right?
Fuck.
There it is.
Gracias.
All right, so, when we get
the bitcoins, then what?
l need cash.
Well, you would have to do
a currency exchange
to get the US dollar
equivalent,
but, l mean. . .
That kind of
defeats the purpose
of a non-fiat currency,
right?
Okay, see, l don`t give
a fuck about all that
Aaron Swartz
Occupy Wall Street shit.
Okay, well,
you`d have to link
your Bitcoin account
to a bank account,
and then there`s this
infinitesimally small chance
that it could be traced.
l mean, the Feds
would have to know
exactly what they`re
looking for, you know.
lt`s not something
they could just
stumble upon randomly.
Basically, l would
just have to make
a stupid-ass mistake
for them to trace it.
And do l look like
the type of nigga
that makes
stupid-ass mistakes?
Um. . .
So, uh, you want me to
set up that exchange?
l`m. . . l`m good.
l`ll do it.
Um. . .
What if l want
zero chances of trace?
Well. . .
lf you want zero trace,
you gotta go
black market, homey.
WlLL: Yeah, you got to put
the bitcoins on a drive.
And make
a hand-to-hand exchange.
You get cash minus
the transaction fee.
lf you really want
to go that route,
and l really
don`t suggest it,
I know a dude in
the garment district.
Ask for FideI.
lf you pass his test,
he`ll help you.
lf you don`t...
Well, just pass his test.
One of these Alligator bags
was made here.
One is from the store.
Which one is which?
The right one,
l mean, `cause it`s. . .
Poofier.
They both
look the same.
The reality is,
l sell 90% of my stuff
to white hos.
Most aren`t rich enough
to afford retail.
Why do you think that is?
l don`t know.
They know.
They know the only difference
between these two bags
is the person rocking them.
So, when they rock `em,
people are gonna
assume it`s real.
And the flip of that is,
it doesn`t matter if
you had the receipt
from Barneys
sewn into the bag.
People gonna assume it`s fake.
Only you know the truth.
So, what are you, man?
Are you a real?
Are you a fake?
That`s what l need
to find out.
l`m just Malcolm.
``Just Malcolm``?
Who the fuck is Malcolm?
Show me.
l want you to hit me
as hard as you can.
Hey! Don`t look at them.
This is between you and me.
l`m-a give you
five seconds.
You can either man up
or run out like the
little bitch you is.
One!
Malcolm, let`s just go.
Listen to your
friends, boy. Two!
You can`t be serious.
l`m more than serious,
motherfucker.
Three!
l need that money.
You ain`t gettin` shit.
Four!
Yeah, you see your
pussy friends leaving?
They`re running like
some little bitches.
Run, pussy.
Five! Five! Five!
Hit me, man !
Five, motherfuck. . .
Oh, man. You. . .
Drive.
Where?
Give me the drive!
Shit.
Come here, man.
Now l know who you are.
A man that does not
give a fuck.
Hey, Blood !
Don`t you owe me
another shoe, nigga?
Shit!
Get on the ground,
bitch-ass nigga.
Get the fuck off me!
JlB: Malcolm !
Get off us! Malcolm !
BUG:
Stay the fuck down, nigga.
JlB: Malcolm !
BUG: Bitch, nigga. Yeah.
MAN: Yeah !
DlGGY: Jib,
get the fucking bag.
MAN: Come on !
Oh, shit.
Hold on, hold on.
Hey, hold on.
Give me the bag.
Please,
just give me the bag.
l don`t even want
that shit, Blood.
Let`s go, nigga.
All right. Come on.
MAN: We out, we out, we out.
lt`s okay.
Come on.
Let`s go.
That`s 1 0%.
Consider it a proffer.
The rest is in
a Bitcoin account.
Bitcoin?
lt`s an untraceable
internet currency.
There are web sites
that sell a lot of things
that people would get
in trouble for selling.
They use bitcoins.
Kind of like Amazon.
So you sold on the lnternet?
No.
No. You did.
Excuse me?
You set up a store on
Black Market Reloaded.
Very successful.
l mean, you moved
your entire inventory.
See, the market`s
been pretty volatile,
but as of right now,
you have $97,267
and 31 cents
in your Bitcoin
exchange account.
$1 0,000 in cash.
Now, as long as your bitcoins
stay in the exchange account,
they`re safe, untraceable.
Now, if you were to exchange
the bitcoins into dollars
and transfer that money
into your Jacoby Check
Cashing corporate account,
there would be a really,
really small chance of it
getting traced
by the DEA or FBl.
l mean, that would
only happen if you were
idiotically sloppy
while setting up the
Bitcoin exchange account.
So, uh, you want me to
set up that exchange?
l`m good. l`ll do it.
l mean, that. . .
l mean, it would
almost have to be. . .
lntentional.
And why should l believe
any of this, Malcolm?
ls your Jacoby APS
shipping account number
CaIifornia regionaI
bank number 267856783?
Federal tax id 95. . .
Hey, you really should
just upgrade your firewall,
you know?
l actually know a guy.
He`s kind of familiar
with your system already.
You`re all out of
toilet paper, hon.
Courtside, okay?
Courtside.
Gotta have it.
No, come on.
Now, what if l report
to the authorities
that my securities
have been breached
and my identity
has been stolen?
As l`ve just learned,
it doesn`t matter if
this bag is real or fake.
Because of where
l come from,
everybody`s going
to assume it`s fake.
So, since you and l come
from the same place,
what is the DEA going
to assume about you?
And because you and l
are from the same place,
Malcolm,
you should know
what a person like me
can do to a person
like you.
Yeah.
But that`s not what
a Harvard man would do.
Nah, see, a man of Harvard
is smart enough to see
that would set off
a chain of events
that would
inevitably come back
and destroy him.
And everything he`s built.
That wouId be a shame.
So, l think you should
take this opportunity
before you very seriously.
Do everything in your power
to ensure that l become
a man of Harvard,
and make sure
nothing happens to a hair
on my gorgeous head.
Can you dig it?
I`m eating good
Can`t bring me down
Can`t bring me down
Can`t bring me down
Malcolm, you forgot your bag.
lt`s fake.
MR. BAlLEY: MaIcoIm.
You`re pretty damn arrogant.
You think you`re gonna
get into Harvard?
Who do you think you are?
Let me tell you
about two students.
MALCOLM: Student "A``
is a straight-A student
who Iives in the suburbs
of Los Angeles.
He plays in a punk band
with his best friends.
He Ioves to skateboard
and ride on his BMX bike.
His favorite TV show
is Game of Thrones
and his favorite band
is The ThermaIs.
He`s a `90s hip-hop geek.
Student ``B`` goes to
an underfunded school,
where teachers who wouId
rather not be there
teach kids
who really don`t care.
He Iives with
a single mother,
doesn`t know his father
and has sold dope.
Now close your eyes.
Picture each of these kids
and tell me what you see.
Be honest. No one`s
going to judge you.
Now open your eyes.
So, am l student
``A`` or student ``B``?
Am l a geek or a menace?
For most of my life,
l`ve been caught in
between who l really am
and how l`m perceived,
in between categories
and definition.
l don`t fit in.
And l used to think that
that was a curse,
but now l`m slowly
starting to see
maybe it`s a blessing.
See, when you don`t fit in,
you`re forced to see the world
from many different angles
and points of view.
You gain knowledge,
life lessons
from disparate people
and places.
And those lessons,
for better or worse,
have shaped me.
So, who am l?
Allow me to
reintroduce myself.
My name is
Malcolm Adekanbi.
l`m a straight-A student
with nearly perfect
SAT scores.
l taught myself
how to play guitar
and read music.
l have stellar
recommendations
and diverse
extra-curricular activities.
l am a Google
Science Fair participant,
and in three weeks,
l helped make
over $1 00,000 for
an online business.
So, why do l want
to attend Harvard?
lf l was white,
would you even have to
ask me that question?
WOMAN:
lt`s my turn now
lt`s my turn now
This might burn now
lt`s my world now
lt`s my turn now
lt`s my turn now
This might burn now

MAN:
How come you don`t
hear me, ma?
TeII me where

How are you just

Waiting for some inspiration

Nice haircut.

l`m. . . l`m sorry
for all the stuff
that l said.
There was a lot
going on at the time.
And that wasn`t me.
Yeah, it was.
You might have
all these other folks
fooled, but not me.
You`re. . .
Complicated.
Anyway, l just came by
to say thank you.
Thank you?
You. . . You passed?
Mmm-hmm.
You passed.
You were supposed to go
to prom with me.
No.
l told you l wasn`t mad
about missing prom.
Hey.
l was mad about
missing Six Flags.
l`ll pick you up
in the morning.
WOMAN:

Yes, sir
Maybe `cause it`s all l know
Come on
Life don`t

Yes, sir
Оne continuous note
Come on
The ink in my pen is light
Yes, sir
No erasers, duh
Come on
Some peopIe

Yes, sir
Maybe that`s why they go
Come on
Seek the being subIime
Yes, sir

Come on
Even though l`m
one of their kind
Yes, sir
And this encounter is cIose
Come on

down on the Iine
Yes, sir
Till l`m eternally a ghost
Come on
The opportunity is to dine
Yes, sir
So right now It just
tastes Iike toast
Come on
`Cause I`m eating good
Can`t bring me down

Can`t bring me down
Maybe l`m not doing fine
Yes, sir
And maybe l`m
not breaking gold
Come on
But you ain`t gonna

Yes, sir
And you gonna see
a nigga hit his goal
You gonna see

Watch how a nigga destroy
Come on
Life is surrounded by signs
Yes, sir

Yes, sir
Some say they

Come on
Nothin` in their Iife

Yes, sir
And then they wonder

Come on
They would rather
grow like vines

Six seconds, then they go
Come on
But I wouId
rather be a bonsai
Yes, sir
And then never
grow with the flow
and teII them
Come on

Can`t bring me down

Can`t bring me down
Awreeoh

Sure to blow,
but not them probably
Black on the outside,
white in the middIe
I want to feeI Iove
l want to just giggle
About this worId
The buIIshit in front of it
Make a nigga just
want to get steamrolled
SteamroIIed
Everybody say ``SteamroIIed``
SteamroIIed
Oh, man, I`m rollin`,
rollin`, rollin`, rollin`
I`m rollin`,
rollin`, rollin`, rollin`
l`m grindin`,
I`m bitin` down
l`m grindin`
to light and sound
And l`m grindin`
lt`s tightenin` now
And l`m signin`
Because l`m bright and loud
l`m feelin` good
Can`t bring me down
l`m in a good mood
Can`t bring me down
