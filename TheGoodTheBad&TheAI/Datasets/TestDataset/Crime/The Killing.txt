Lucky Arrow breaking on top.
Purple Shadow is second.
At exactly 3.45 on that Saturday
afternoon in the last week of September,
Marvin Unger was perhaps the only one
of the 100,000 people at the track
who felt no thrill at
the running of the fifth race.
He was disinterested in horse racing and
held a lifelong contempt for gambling.
Nevertheless, he had a five-dollar win bet
on every horse in the fifth race.
He knew this unique system of betting
would more than likely result in a loss.
But he didn't care. After all, he thought,
what would the loss of 30 dollars mean
in comparison to the vast sum
of money ultimately at stake?
- Bottle of ginger ale, please.
- Yes, sir. Comin' right up.
Favourite broke bad.
Could be anybody's race.
Could be.
He's in the five-dollar win,
next to the five-dollar place.
- Quite a crowd you got.
- Yeah.
Passing the quarter pole, it is
Lucky Arrow and Purple Shadow
with Stopwatch on the outside, third.
At the head of the stretch, it is
Purple Shadow leading by a length.
Lucky Arrow is second by three quarters.
Stopwatch, coming up on the outside,
is third by a length and a quarter.
Then Southern Star, Vain Effort, Stanley
Gabe, Third Row and Lover's Dilemma.
It is Lucky Arrow... he's lost it by
a head. Purple Shadow by a head,
and Stopwatch moving
fast on the outside.
It's Lucky Arrow, Purple Shadow
and Stopwatch neck and neck.
It's Lucky Arrow, Purple
Shadow and Stopwatch...
Purple Shadow second by a head,
Lucky Arrow third by a length
and Southern Star finished fourth.
Waiting for the race
to become official, he began to feel
he had as much effect on
the outcome of the operation
as a piece of a jumbled jigsaw puzzle
has to its predetermined final design.
Adding the missing
fragments of the puzzle
would reveal whether the picture
was as he guessed it would be.
The result of the fifth
race is now declared official.
An hour earlier that same
afternoon, in another part of the city,
Patrolman First Class Randy Kennan had
some personal business to attend to.
Hiya, Tiny. What's the good word?
Same as always. Havin' a ball.
I'll see you later.
Good evening, Randy.
How've things been?
What's the use of kicking, Leo?
You wouldn't believe it anyway.
I supposed they were very well.
After all, a man drives a new car,
- lives in a fine apartment...
- So I like to live good. Any objections?
None at all.
If you don't overlook your obligation to
me. I trust it was purely an oversight.
I'm sure a man in your position wouldn't
deliberately antagonise his creditors.
I ain't got it, Leo. I know I should have it,
and I'm as anxious to pay you off as
you are to have me, but I just ain't got it.
Well, we all get a little
cramped now and then.
Suppose we make it a thousand. I'll
rewrite the balance as a new loan.
- Give you a fiscal breather. Fresh start.
- Leo, I'm broke. Get me? Flat broke.
Right now I don't have a thousand cents.
If you can wait a coupla weeks...
Might be arranged.
With the proper collateral, of course.
You mean "Where is the dough
comin' from?" I can't tell you.
But it's a plenty sweet deal and I'll
be able to pay out like a slot machine.
- Two weeks, you said. No longer?
- Maybe even less than that.
You know I wouldn't pull a thing
like this on you. I couldn't afford to.
I'm glad you said that. I was going to point
out as much, but since you relieve me
- of the unpleasant necessity...
- It's a deal, then?
I pay you the 2600 within two weeks?
Plus $400, a total of 3,000.
The extra interest, of course.
I trust that'll be satisfactory.
- I couldn't say no.
- Thank you, Randy.
I was sure you'd see it my way.
Take good care of yourself.
I'll take care of myself, mister.
That's my specialty.
At 7pm that same day, Johnny Clay,
perhaps the most important thread in the
unfinished fabric, furthered its design.
None of these men are criminals in
the usual sense. They've all got jobs,
they all live seemingly normal, decent
lives, but they got their problems
and they've all got a little larceny in 'em.
Take my pal unger, for instance,
the guy who owns this apartment.
He's putting up the money to operate with
and he's letting me stay here.
He's a book-keeper. Been with
the same company for ten years.
You know, Fay, the mistake I made
before was shooting for peanuts.
Five years have taught me
one thing, if nothing else.
If you take a chance,
be sure the reward's worth the risk.
They can put you away just as fast
for a ten-dollar heist as for a million.
You don't have to sell it to me. You know
I'll go along with anything you say.
I always have, you know,
ever since we were kids.
I've always believed you,
everything you've ever told me.
Those five years you been away, I know
they must have been terrible for you.
I mean... being locked up
must be a terrible thing.
You know something?
This may sound funny, but...
waiting for you all those years
and staying by myself,
it was like... not that you were locked in,
but I was locked out.
Look at me. First time we're together
in five years and I'm making speeches.
Now, now. Everything's gonna
be all right, I promise you.
Make sure you're right about it, Johnny.
I'm no good for anybody else.
I'm not pretty and I'm not very smart, so
please don't leave me alone any more.
Nothing is gonna happen. Not this time.
Well, I... I guess I'd better leave you be
now. I know you got a lot of work to do.
- When will I see you again?
- Saturday night.
We'll be on the plane together. Look, Fay,
until it's all over, I want
you to stay out of the way.
- If there's anything I can do to help...
- No. Just make the plane reservations.
And tell 'em at the office that you're
leaving. Tell 'em you're getting married.
I don't wanna say goodbye.
- Oh.
- Hello, Marv. We were talking about you.
- Hi, Johnny. Hi, Miss Fay.
- Hello.
- I hope it was something nice.
- Oh, yes.
Johnny was telling me what
a wonderful friend you were.
- Fay was just leaving, weren't you?
- Don't rush off on my account.
- She's late for an appointment.
- That's right.
- You'll be sure to call me, won't you?
- Yeah. I'll do just what I told you.
It was nice to see you again, Mr unger.
Take care of Johnny.
- There's nothing I wouldn't do for Johnny.
- I'll see you.
Half an hour earlier,
at approximately 6.30,
Mike O'Reilly, the track
bartender, came home.
Ruthie? I'm home.
At 7.15 that night,
George Peatty, the track cashier,
arrived at his apartment.
Hello.
Hello.
- Feelin' OK?
- Fine.
I been kinda sick. I keep
gettin' pains in my stomach.
Maybe you got a hole in it.
Do you suppose you have?
- How would I get a hole in my stomach?
- How would you get one in your head?
Fix me a drink, George. I think
I'm developing some pains myself.
Sherry, can't I say anything at all
without you joking about it?
Hurry up with that drink, George.
The pains are gettin' worse.
I saw somethin' nice comin' home on
the train tonight. Somethin' kinda sweet.
- A candy bar, George?
- No, not a candy bar, doughnut.
It was people.
This couple sittin' in front of me.
They weren't young, exactly. I guess
the woman was about your age.
A little senile, you mean? With
one foot and a big toe in the grave?
You wanna hear this or not, Sherry?
I can't wait. Go ahead
and thrill me, George.
Well, they were in front of me and I could
hear what they said. Well, part of it.
- They weren't young, exactly...
- She was about my age, you said.
Not any more. Maybe she was when
you started this story, but not now.
Anyway, she called him poppa
and he called her momma.
And the climax to this ex citing story?
The moral? The punch line, George?
Forget it, Sherry. Just thought I'd tell
you about it, but I might have known.
I know. You want to bet I know,
I'll give you seven to five.
Cut it out, will you, Sherry?
- I'm tired. I don't feel so good.
- You want me to call you poppa.
- Isn't that it? And you'd call me momma.
- You know all the answers.
Go ahead. It may be your last word,
but I'll try to kill you painlessly.
I gotta go out. I don't suppose
there's anything for dinner?
Of course there is.
There are all sorts of things.
- Well, steak and asparagus and potatoes.
- I don't smell nothin'.
- That figures. You're too far away from it.
- Too far away?
Certainly. You don't think I had it cooked,
do you? It's down the shopping centre.
Tell me something, would you,
Sherry? Just tell me one thing.
Why did you ever marry me anyway?
Oh, George, when a man has to ask his
wife that... He just hadn't better, that's all.
Why talk about it?
Maybe it's all to the good.
If people didn't have headaches, what
would happen to the aspirin industry?
You used to love me.
You said you did, anyway.
You made a memorable statement too.
Something about hitting it rich,
having an apartment on Park Avenue and
a different car for every day of the week.
Not that I care, as long as I have a big
handsome intelligent brute like you.
It would make a difference,
wouldn't it? If I had money, I mean.
How do you define money? If you mean
your collection of Roosevelt dimes...
I mean big money. Hundreds
of thousands of dollars.
You really aren't well. You sure
that pain's in your stomach?
I'm gonna have it. Hundreds of thousands.
- Maybe a half a million.
- Course you are, darling.
You put the right address on the envelope
when you sent it to the north pole?
Go ahead and laugh. Wait and see. You
won't be laughing so hard in a few days.
You're serious. You really think
you're gonna have a lot of money.
- I don't think nothin'. I know it.
- You've never been a liar, George.
You don't have enough imagination to lie.
What makes you think you'll have
several hundred thousand dollars?
Cos I do. I just can't talk about it.
- Not even to me?
- I shouldn't have even mentioned it.
It's not that I mind, I know I can
trust you. But these other guys...
- These other guys?
- I can't talk about it, Sherry. I just can't.
These guys, is that why you're
going out? To meet them?
They got nothing to do with that.
I just gotta go uptown for a while.
I see. Well, go ahead. If you wanna act
that way, I certainly won't try to stop you.
Sherry, no. Sherry, honey,
don't be sore at me.
Well, when a woman's
been married five years
and her husband doesn't trust her...
You think more of them than of me.
What right have you got to say a thing
like that? You know I'm crazy about you.
I'd do anything for you. You're the one
I'm doing it for. If I didn't love you so...
I don't want you to do anything.
I don't even wanna talk to you.
- Go see your fella, whatever you want.
- Sherry.
Don't be surprised if I'm not here when
you get home. Don't at all be surprised.
You better be here, you hear me?
You will be, won't you?
You wouldn't do anything
foolish, would you?
I wouldn't want to, but as long as you
don't trust me or have a bit of faith in me...
If I ever found you with another man...
Why? You have no use for me. You say
you do, but when it comes to a showdown
or proving it, you say one thing
then you do the opposite.
Well, I could tell you a little bit
about it, I guess. Well, most of it.
- But you have to promise to keep quiet.
- Why, of course, darling.
Just a second.
- Well.
- Hello.
- How'd you get away from George?
- He had to go somewhere.
That's a break. I'm glad you called.
- Something wrong, baby?
- No, nothing's wrong.
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, I don't think so.
Come on, now. That's not my baby.
- Val, I called you last night.
- Oh, yeah?
- There was no answer.
- Guess I stepped out.
- I called you four times.
- Honey, I guess I was out somewhere.
Oh? What'd you do?
I dunno, I guess I was
goofing off at the movies.
- Val, why are you doing this to me?
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do.
- Oh, look, Mrs Peatty.
What I do is my own business.
I never tried to pin you down, did I?
I never asked how you got
your kicks before you met me.
You didn't use to talk to me like that.
I'm sorry, baby, but don't bug me.
I gotta live my life a certain way.
- I can't stand it when the walls close in.
- But you know how crazy I am about you.
And I'm crazy about you too, sweetheart.
I've given you sufficient proof of that.
- Well, I know, but lately every time I call...
- So I step out once in a while.
You got a husband who'll
spend every last nickel on you,
won't ask questions if you come home
from an afternoon movie at nine at night.
- Don't be greedy.
- I'm not, I'm in love with you.
If that's being greedy,
I'm the biggest glutton on Earth.
Don't make it so ominous.
It's not like you'll eat me alive.
I may just do that.
Darling, what are the two things
in life you're most interested in?
- What?
- Money and women?
- That's a nice way to put me down.
- Sums it up, doesn't it?
We'll let it stand, but I imagine what you
meant to say was "money and woman".
We'll have money. More money than you
ever dreamed of. Maybe even millions.
- Oh, yeah? How?
- George, that's how.
- He's stumbled onto something big.
- That meatball?
A meatball with gravy, Val.
You know he works at the track.
Well, somehow, don't ask me how,
he's got connected with a mob.
They're gonna rob the track
offices for the day's receipts.
He seriously told you that he and some
mob are gonna knock over the racetrack?
You can believe him. George
may be a fool but he's not a liar.
- He's crazy. It's never been done before.
- I know, I told him that.
But he says the job's all set up
and it's gonna be done.
And if I just sit tight, I'd be up to
my curls in cash, just like that.
Well, let's suppose this is
all true. How do I fit in?
Well, you know I'm gonna leave
George. I guess you know why, too.
You've been saying that
for a long, long time, Sherry.
Everything's changed.
I was gonna tell him tonight.
George may be very rich very soon.
- That's all he needs, isn't it?
- He'll still be George.
So you think, uh, let's say George and his
boys pull this job and George gets his cut.
- Maybe I could take it away from him.
- I think you could.
And the others? Any idea who they are?
Only this. I went through
his clothes while he was showering.
I'm quite sure George went there tonight.
Kiddo, I think we got somethin' here.
You know, if this is true, this
is a lot bigger than you think.
You're interested in takin' George's cut?
It's gonna be peanuts
compared to this whole thing.
We gotta find out more about the overall
plan. You think he'd tell you any more?
Not a chance. He was scared stiff
cos he talked as much as he did.
I don't get it, Johnny,
about these two other guys.
You mean they're gonna be in on the deal,
and we ain't gonna know who they are?
That's right. And they don't know who you
are. That makes sense to you, doesn't it?
- Yes, I guess so, but...
- It makes sense to me all right.
- How come we need 'em, though?
- One of them's for the job with the rifle.
None of you could do it, even if you were
willing. The other starts a fight in the bar.
What are they cutting in for? Not that
I mind, anything you do is OK, but...
They're not in on the scheme. They get
paid to do certain duties at a certain time.
And they're not cutting in on the take.
They get a flat price for a straight job.
If they don't know about the basic plan,
the job, why are they doin' it?
They're straight hoods, paid in advance.
Five grand for the one with the rifle,
- 2500 for the other.
- Where's this money comin' from?
That's where Marvin comes in. He gets
us the 7500 and gets it back off the top.
Wish I could do more. It's almost not right
for me to get as much as everybody else.
- After all, all I do is...
- Your money counts for plenty, Marv.
- You don't hear them complaining.
- Sure. You're OK in our book, Marv.
But if these hoods get paid in advance,
how do you know they'll do their jobs?
I'll vouch for 'em. They're pros.
They can't afford to weasel out on a deal.
If they did, they'd be washed up.
OK? Any other questions?
Well, let's take a look at this, then.
This is a rough drawing of
the track as I remember it.
Randy, you'll have to get me an
A1 street map of the whole district.
George, Mike, I want you to go over
this thing with me inch by inch.
Bring it up to date, add or
subtract the slightest change,
even something as small as
the placing of a hot-dog stand.
Now, give or take a few thousand,
I figure the loot on this deal at two million.
There should be that much in the offices.
That includes profits on
pari-mutuel betting, breakage money,
taxes from the mutuel machines, receipts
from concessions and the ticket sales.
None of this money is allowed to
accumulate at any point on the track.
Ex cept for change and the mutuel clerk's
payoff money, it all goes into the office.
Out of the entire take, only a few thousand
dollars is put in the safe for emergencies.
The rest is out in the open,
held for pick-up by armoured car.
That car arrives about five o'clock and
parks directly in front of the clubhouse.
Two men stay in it. One at the wheel,
one at a machine gun in the turret.
Two others collect the dough.
They're armed, of course.
So are the track detectives who
cover them from the car to the office.
- Once the car arrives, a stick-up is...
-
Is out of the question.
Say, what in the name of Pete
would a babe be doing outside that door?
What do you think? You guys,
any of you ever see this woman before?
- It's Sherry, my wife.
- You been talking. You spilled to her.
I didn't. What, do you think
I'm crazy? I wouldn't...
You jerk! You clown! Come on, clown,
sing us a chorus from Pagliacci.
You better talk, George,
or we'll get it out of her.
Please, you wouldn't do
anything to hurt her? Please.
- If you won't say what you told her...
- I didn't tell her nothin', honest I didn't.
- Why would I do a thing like that?
- Sure you wouldn't.
She's a building inspector. Just stopped
there to measure the keyhole. Why, you...
Let's have it. We'll get it out of
one of you. If you didn't tell her,
why was she around here snoopin'?
She must have found the address
in my pocket. Sure, that's it.
Thought I was two-timing her,
runnin' around with another...
Of course. She's just
checkin' up on me, John.
I ain't done nothin', honest I didn't.
You'll let her go, won't you?
You won't hurt her, John?
Randy? Mike? Take him to his apartment
and stick with him until I phone.
- No, I'm not leaving Sherry!
- You're leavin' all right.
- How are you goin'? Slidin' or walkin'?
- Come on, George, let's go.
What are you gonna do now, Johnny?
Ah, I don't think I'll have to kill her. Just
slap that pretty face into hamburger meat.
Marv, take yourself
a walk for an hour or so.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll be
back in a couple of hours.
All right, sister, that's a pretty
head you got on your shoulders.
You wanna keep it there or
carry it around in your hands?
We could compromise and put it on
your shoulder. I think that'd be nice.
- What were you doing outside that door?
- Doing? I was listening, naturally.
- Trying to, I should say.
- You admit you were out there snooping?
Yes. Wasn't that naughty of me?
But I'm afraid I was.
I found an address in George's pocket.
I thought he was playing around, so I...
And you'd care if he was playin'
another dame? That would bother you?
You don't understand me, Johnny.
You don't know me very well.
I know you like a book. You're
a no-good nosey little tramp.
You'd sell out your mother for
a piece of fudge, but you're smart.
You know when to sell, when to sit tight.
You know to sit tight now.
- I do?
- You heard me. You like money.
You got a big dollar sign where
most women have a heart.
So play it smart and you'll have money.
George'll have it and he'll blow it on you.
- Probably buy himself a five-cent cigar.
- You don't know me very well, Johnny.
I wouldn't think of letting George
throw his money away on cigars.
- Isn't there a big "if" in there somewhere?
- Yeah, there's a couple of 'em.
If you're smart, keep your trap shut and
don't nose around, you'll have money.
You'll be loaded. If you don't, we'll forget
the whole thing. You won't have a penny.
I wouldn't like that and, frail as I am,
I'd much prefer to be loaded.
I think we understand
each other. Now beat it.
Those guys.
Fine friends they turned out to be.
Slappin' me around,
callin' me dirty names.
I thought that rotten Randy
would cave my head in.
Poor George.
You're all right now, aren't you?
Doggone it, you shouldn't have come over
there. It's a wonder we didn't get killed.
There wasn't much danger of that. If they
killed you there couldn't be a robbery.
They did anything to harm me,
it would offend you...
They have offended me.
Offended me plenty.
- George, don't be such an old bear.
- They have, and I won't forget in a hurry.
What else could they have done?
I thought they acted quite reasonably.
Well, anyway...
What... What did Johnny do to you?
Do? I already told you.
Just asked me some questions
and made sure it was
all right for me to leave.
- Sherry, did Johnny try anything?
- George, what a terrible thing to ask.
- I was sure you wouldn't.
- You'd better not say any more.
Why did you come over there?
It wasn't for the reason you said.
It was for the reason you said.
You said it yourself.
I was making an alibi for you.
I was afraid those guys'd kill you.
You know I wouldn't look at another
woman. No women would chase after me.
Oh, let's drop it. You put words in my
mouth, then you say they're not true.
I told you exactly what happened.
Oh, dear. Everything's all right
with you and your pals now.
- You're gonna have lots of money and...
- I been thinkin' it over.
I can hardly wait. How soon
will it be, George? What day?
It ain't going to be, Sherry.
I'm droppin' out.
You're dropping...? Oh, you
don't mean it. You can't mean it.
I'm afraid, Sherry. This business
tonight, it kinda opened my eyes.
It made me realise the kind of
guys I was gettin' mixed up with.
- Before, all I thought of was the money.
- You just keep on thinking about that.
Think how disappointed I'd be
if you didn't get that money.
I'd feel like you didn't really love me.
I don't see how I could feel any other way.
Why? Why should I have to do a thing
like that to prove to you that I love you?
George, what are you gonna do?
I wanna know right now.
All you ever do is talk about loving me.
That's all I've had for the last five years.
Now you have a chance to do something
and to... all those things you promised,
buy me things... Well,
what are you gonna do?
You know there ain't a thing
in the world I wouldn't do for you.
Then you'll do this for me, won't you?
- I guess so.
- lt'll be perfect.
You have no idea how perfect.
I won't have long to wait, will I? It will
be within the next few days, won't it?
- When will it be, George?
- You got your own way, Sherry.
You want me to go ahead with the deal,
so I am. Now leave me alone, will you?
I'm sorry, darling. Of course. We won't
even talk about it if you don't want to.
- You really love me, Sherry?
- Of course.
- You'll always love me?
- Always and always.
Three days later, at 10.15 on a Tuesday,
Johnny Clay began the final preparations.
- You want somebody to play with?
- No, thanks. I'm lookin' for a friend.
Oh, you pizda. You missed a move.
Knight to knight five, pawn takes knight,
rook takes rook, queen
to rook four, check...
Go bother someone else! He couldn't do
that. You don't know what you're talking.
Shut up, pizda. Make a move.
- He's right. I could have won your rook.
- Move, pizda.
Look, stop talking or I'll call Fisher.
I can't think with this noise!
Good game, Maurice?
- Johnny, my old friend. How are you?
- Good to see you. Been a long time, eh?
- How long have you been out?
- Not long.
- It was difficult, no?
- Yeah.
- Very difficult.
- You have my sympathies, Johnny.
You have not yet learned that
you have to be like everyone else.
The perfect mediocrity.
No better, no worse.
Individuality is a monster, and
it must be strangled in its cradle
to make our friends feel comfortable.
You know, I often thought
that the gangster and the artist
are the same in the eyes of the masses.
They're admired and hero-worshipped,
but there is always present
underlying wish to see them
destroyed at the peak of their glory.
Yeah. Like the... Like the man said,
"Life is like a glass of tea."
Oh, Johnny, my friend,
you never were very bright.
But I love you anyway.
How's life been treating you, Maurice?
About the same as always. When I need
some money, I go out and wrestle.
But mostly I'm up here,
wasting my time playing chess.
But I wouldn't know what to do with
myself if I didn't have this place to go to.
Maurice, could you use 2500 dollars?
It does have a nice ring to the ear.
Quite musical. What is it for?
For taking care of half a dozen
private dicks. Racetrack cops.
Start a fight with the bartender.
The track cops will break it up.
You keep 'em busy, make 'em drag you
out. No gunplay, strictly a muscle job.
Would it be out of order for me to ask
why you would pay such a price
to see me demonstrate my talents?
I would imagine... it is for more than
just your personal entertainment.
$2500 is a lot of dough, Maurice.
Part of it's for not asking questions.
That sounds not unreasonable.
Still, I will probably go to jail,
and jails I have found unpleasant.
Food is very bad, company
is poor, beds are too small...
It'll only be a disorderly conduct
charge. Maybe 60 days, no worse.
And if a man has a little money to
spread around, he'll be comfortable.
I do not quite understand, Johnny.
For what you want me to do, you could
get any hoodlum for a hundred dollars.
I don't want any hoodlum. I want a guy
like you, someone who's dependable,
who knows he's paid to take a risk
and won't squawk if it gets rough.
I was thinking if perhaps we can
work out some other arrangement.
But suppose I were
willing to forgo part of it
and take a share in your...
enterprise instead. No?
No. It's not mine to share up.
Very well, Johnny. I sense there
will be certain details to work out.
Yeah. I'll buy you a cup of coffee, huh?
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Yeah, exactly what I wanted.
You could take care of a roomful of
people with that. Maybe not kill 'em all,
- but they wouldn't do much afterwards.
- I knew you'd take care of it, Nicky.
- How long you had this place?
- Almost a year.
Picturesque, but there
can't be much profit in it.
There isn't. But there isn't much trouble
neither. What are you thinkin' about?
A job. Your kind of a job. A job with a rifle.
- What kind of money, pops?
- 5,000.
- Who do I have to kill?
- A horse.
- A horse?
- A four-legged horse.
- And for that I get 5,000?
- Well, for that and...
- I figured there'd be a gimmick.
- It's not as tough as you may think.
You shoot the horse and if anything
goes wrong, you don't squawk.
- All I gotta do is bump off a horse?
- It's a special kind of a horse, Nick.
For certain reasons,
including your protection,
I won't give you the whole story,
just your part of it.
Next Saturday is the $100,000 handicap.
In the seventh race, the big race,
a certain horse is running. The best
three-year-old to come along in years.
He's a winner and won't pay even money
cos half the people will be down on him.
There's a parking lot 300 feet from
the northwest corner of the track.
From a car parked in the corner of
that lot, you get a view of the horses
as they come around
and start into the stretch.
A man in a car parked there using a
high-powered rifle with a telescopic sight
could bring down
any horse with a single shot.
A man with your eye
would hardly need a sight.
That horse is worth quarter of a million,
and the crowd would go nuts.
Let 'em. You can do it, and you'd have
no trouble getting away in the confusion.
Red Lightning will be leading
in the stretch. So he goes down,
a couple of other horses pile up on top
of him. There'll be plenty of confusion.
One more thing. Suppose by accident you
do get picked up. What have you done?
You shot a horse. It isn't murder,
in fact I don't know what it is,
but the best thing they could get
you on would be inciting a riot,
- or shooting horses out of season.
- You make it sound real simple, pops.
- OK, pops, how do I get it?
- 2500 today, 2500 the day after the race.
OK. Crazy. Now, tell me,
what's your angle, John?
They'll probably call the race off,
and not pay off any of the bets?
Maybe, but what my
angle is is my business.
paying it. So nobody knows my business.
All right, John. You ain't gonna get
no trouble with me. I'm with you.
- I'm lookin' for Joe Piano.
- Who's lookin'?
- Patsy sent me.
- Patsy who?
- Patsy Gennelli.
- Where did you see Patsy?
Alcatraz. We roomed together. My name...
Don't tell me who you are.
What can I do for you?
I want a place to stay for a week. I won't
be in it much, I don't want it cleaned
- and I want anybody in it ex cept myself.
- I think I can accommodate you.
- So how's the boy?
- He's fine. He's doing it on his ear.
- He's the best pitcher they got.
- I know.
- He said not to worry about him.
- He's doing the book. I worry plenty.
- He's tough, maybe he'll get a break.
- Yeah, I know. Let's hope.
There. I got another one. Don't worry
about leaving anything here.
It'll be safe. I'm always over here.
There'll be no maid service.
- You wanna leave anything?
- This, and another bag next week.
- Don't worry. Nobody will disturb them.
- What'll it be?
- Oh, no, no. No charge. Patsy sent you.
- Sure he sent me, but he's a friend.
I'd feel better if I paid. A business
arrangement. I can afford it.
- OK, then. It'll be ten dollars a week.
- All right.
I'll send the money in the bus to the boy.
Thank you very much. Have a nice time.
Four days later, at 7.30am,
Sherry Peatty was wide awake.
- Gosh, honey, did I wake you? I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
- I couldn't sleep.
- Can I get you anything? More coffee?
No, I guess not.
Nice of you to offer, though.
I don't know, I'm just restless. I'll be
all right. Go on back to bed, will you?
I won't. Even if I don't get up
to get my husband's breakfast,
the least I can do is sit with him
while he has his coffee.
Sherry, are you sure you feel all right?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that
the way it sounded.
I deserved it.
I know I've been irritable and moody
lately and I haven't acted like I should.
It's just I can't stand living like this. This
crummy apartment, hamburger for dinner.
- You haven't been so bad, baby.
- Yes, I have.
Things are gonna be different. When we
get all that money and have nice things,
I'll stop thinking about myself so much.
Your problems will be my problems.
Whenever you're worried, like now. Is it
the robbery that you're worried about?
Yeah, I guess. Just a little. Oh, I have no
reason to. I know it's gonna be all right.
It's natural you'd be
upset at a time like this.
It's today, isn't it?
What makes you think that? Just because
I couldn't sleep, it doesn't mean...
I know my Georgie. He can't fool me.
I'm right, aren't l, darling?
- Today is the day we get all that money?
- No, you ain't. It isn't today.
If you don't stop pestering me, trying to
find out, there ain't gonna be no money.
- But George, how can you...?
- I mean it, Sherry. I'm gettin' fed up.
You heard what Johnny told you. Stop
butting in, or he'll call the whole thing off.
He told me something else,
which I neglected to tell you.
That if I did butt in, as you and he
choose to call it, he'd break my neck.
Maybe he had reason to. He wanted to
make you understand he means business.
All I've got to say is,
you've changed your tune
since he and his friends
slapped you around.
I was sore about that,
but what could they do?
You said they acted reasonable.
We had no reason to hold a grudge.
I'm not gonna argue with you.
If you let people beat you up,
- then take their side against your wife...
- But you did! I wanted to quit.
You wouldn't let me.
You said I had no reason to.
Anyway, Johnny didn't lay a hand on me.
None of the guys did but Randy.
I was gonna tell you
something about Johnny,
but since you feel about him like
you do, take his word against mine...
What about him?
What were you gonna tell me?
- Let's stop the conversation right there.
- What were you gonna tell me, Sherry?
I don't think I can tell you when
you feel like you do about him.
Not havin' any faith in me,
and keepin' secrets.
We won't have any secrets.
What happened?
Well, I tried to tell you about
this the other night, but...
you were so upset, and every time
I tried to say anything you cut me off.
Sherry, what are you trying to tell me?
I tried to stop him.
I pleaded and I struggled.
It doesn't matter, does it? The only thing
that matters is how I feel about you now.
It is today, isn't it?
Earlier that morning, at 5am, Red
Lightning was fed a half portion of feed
in preparation for the seventh race that
day, the $100,000 Lansdowne Stakes.
At seven that morning Johnny Clay began
what might be the last day of his life.
Yeah, all right, all right.
- What time is it?
- It's early yet. Only seven.
You better go back to sleep after
I leave. I just wanted to say goodbye.
Till tonight, that is. Everything's all set.
Should go perfectly, but if it doesn't,
don't talk about it. You're in the clear for
everything but being short on your books.
Oh, I'm not worried about that.
In fact, I'm not worried about anything.
I just wish there was more I could do.
You've done your part.
I only hope we can do ours as well.
We... we'll probably never see each other
again after we split the money tonight,
but... in my book you'll
always be a stand-up guy.
Johnny, I... I don't know how to say this,
and I don't even know
if I have the right, but...
I've always thought maybe
you're like my own kid.
- Ah, you can say anything you want.
- You've had a lot of rough breaks.
Maybe you've made a few mistakes,
but after today, the good Lord willing,
you'll be a new man. A rich man.
And that can make a lot of difference.
You got a lot of life ahead of you,
a lot of people to meet.
- People of quality and substance.
- What are you gettin' at?
Wouldn't it be great if we
could go away, the two of us,
and let the old world
take a couple of turns
and have a chance
to take stock of things?
It can be pretty serious and terrible,
particularly if it's not the right person.
Getting married, I mean.
You better go back to sleep.
The seventh race starts about 4.30
if you want to catch it on the radio.
I'll be back here about seven o'clock.
Keep away from the track. Go to
a movie or something. See you later.
It was exactly 7 am
when he got to the airport.
The weight is OK, Mr Preston.
Is that all the baggage?
I'll have one more tonight. I can
keep that in the cabin, can't I?
Yes, sir, but be sure and check in before
flight time. Flight 465 leaves at 9pm.
- Thank you.
- Thank you for flying American, sir.
Stopping first at a florist, he arrived at
the motel at 8.15. He was on schedule.
- Good morning, my friend.
- Morning, Joe. Now, look.
This afternoon a friend of mine will
leave a bundle for me. He's a cop.
- A cop?
- Yeah, yeah. He drives a prowl car.
- Funny kind of a friend to have.
- He's a funny kind of a cop.
Let him in. He'll leave this bundle
for me about 6.30. I'll pick it up.
- That's the last you'll see of me.
- Come in for a drink.
I got a lot to do today.
Everything would be fouled up.
I understand. I'll see you tonight.
So long. Take care of yourself.
He reached the bus station at 8.45.
At 9.20 he arrived at Mike's apartment.
Everything had gone according to plan.
Mike O'Reilly was ready at 11.15.
What goes on here?
This is no way to get your strength back.
It's very good, Mike, but
I guess I'm just not hungry.
- Really, I couldn't eat another bite.
- Another? You haven't eaten anything.
I'll take something after a while. After I've
had my medicine I'll have more appetite.
- That's a promise? No tricks now?
- It's a promise.
- Go along now. You'll be late for work.
- Yeah, I guess I will.
Ruthie, things are gonna
get much better for us.
I know. I know, dear.
I know I've made a lot of promises in
the past, but this time it's not just talk.
We'll be rich, and soon. We'll have a fine
house, and doctors to make you well.
Of course, dear, but you'd
better go along or you'll be late.
Yeah.
- Mike?
- Yes?
On your way home, would you
bring me some magazines?
Of course. But, uh, Ruthie,
I'm gonna be a little late.
Probably about ten. Some fellas and
me are having a little get-together.
I understand. Don't you
drink too much beer, mind.
- Remember how it leaves you next day.
- Don't worry about that.
I won't be doing any drinking tonight.
I called Mother. She'll be
over later to fix your dinner.
Thank you, dear.
- Goodbye.
- Don't forget to eat your breakfast.
He reached the bus station at 11.29.
At 12.10, as it was his custom,
he arrived at the track.
- Who's the girlfriend, Mike?
- That's how you spend your money?
You blow your money on dames? An
old man like you ought to know better.
I ain't like you guys.
These posies are for my wife.
Besides, where do you guys
get off calling me an old man?
Buy flowers after work, Mike,
or they'll wilt before you get home.
It can't be helped.
After work the shops will all be closed.
Put 'em in water.
The clubhouse steward would
put 'em in the refrigerator for you.
Well, perhaps I should, but, well,
it's getting kinda late now, and...
- I'm all dressed. Why don't I do it for you?
- No.
What's the matter? I'm doin' you a favour.
These flowers are going in my locker,
then I'll know where they are.
- OK, Mike. Suit yourself.
- Sorry, Bill. I appreciate your offer.
After work, you know how it is. Everybody
will be in a hurry to get away, and...
...is third, and Comfort King.
It is My Baby leading by a length.
Concentrator is second by three quarters
of a length. Second Ending, moving up,
is third, and Comfort King.
It is My Baby, Concentrator
and Second Ending.
It is Second Ending,
Concentrator and Comfort King.
Second Ending in front. Down to the wire,
it's Second Ending the winner by a length,
Concentrator second by two,
Comfort King third and My Baby.
The result of the first race now
appears on the totalizator board.
Be sure to hold all tickets until the
result of the race is declared official.
After the first race,
Mike was very busy.
Gimme a double bourbon, please.
Don't you think you've had enough, pal?
Your attention please. The horses
are now on the track for the second race.
At exactly 3.32
that same afternoon,
Officer Randy Kennan set in
motion his phase of the operation.
Hello, Fred. This is Randy. Listen,
check with the dispatcher's office,
see if they're getting me loud and
clear. I think my set's on the blink.
Sure.
Huh? What? He says it's OK?
That's funny, it keeps going dead.
I don't think it's the tubes.
I'll keep fooling around with it.
Give my regards to your missus. By the
way, when's the big day supposed to be?
Well, don't worry about it.
The sixth one is always the hardest.
Officer!
Officer!
Thank heaven. Hurry! Come quick, they're
killing each other! I always knew they...
He had timed the trip to
the track half a dozen times
and knew at just what point
he should be at precisely what time.
He knew the success of the plan
depended on his accuracy
in arriving at the track
at the correct moment.
A minute or two early was allowable,
but ten seconds late would be fatal.
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.
The horses are now on
the track for the seventh race,
the $100,000-added
Lansdowne Stakes, at one mile.
They're off and running. At the start
it is Red Lightning breaking on top.
Early Streak is second. I'm Hoping
is third. White Fire is fourth.
Earlier that afternoon at 2.30,
Maurice was at the chess club.
He was to be at the track at four o'clock,
just before the start of the seventh race.
Fisher? I am supposed to be
back here tonight about 6.30.
If I'm not, I'd like you
to do something for me.
Sure, Maurice. What is it?
Call this number and ask for Mr Stillman.
Tell him Maurice requires his services.
Sounds pretty mysterious.
What's it all about?
There are some things, my dear Fisher,
which do not bear looking into.
You know of the Siberian goat herder who
tried to discover the nature of the sun?
He stared up at the heavenly
body until it made him blind.
There are many things like this, including
love, death and my business for today.
Please remember to make
that call if I'm not back at 6.30.
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.
The horses are now on
the track for the seventh race,
the $100,000-added
Lansdowne Stakes, at one mile.
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen.
The horses are now on
the track for the seventh race,
the $100,000-added
Lansdowne Stakes, at one mile.
- Bottle of beer.
- Yes, sir.
The horses are approaching
the starting gate for the seventh race.
The horses are approaching
the starting gate for the seventh race.
The horses are at the gate.
The horses are at the gate.
Hey! How about some service,
you stupid-looking Irish pig?
What's the matter with...
C'mon, break it up. Look out.
It was exactly 4.23
when they dragged Maurice out.
At 11.40 that morning,
Nicky left his farm.
He arrived at the track at 12.30.
- Hi there.
- use the other lot. This ain't open yet.
- I don't like to trouble you...
- You're not.
I said there's no parking
here and that's that.
Look, mac, I'm a paraplegic. I want to get
in this lot to watch the race from my car.
That ain't my problem, mister. My leg's
bum too but nobody feels sorry for me.
I know what you mean, buddy.
- Get that in the war?
- Battle of the Bulge.
Say, look, I know this is a lot of
extra trouble for you. I want you to...
- No, no. Skip it, skip it.
- I want you to take it.
Go on, keep it.
It's all right.
- Thanks a lot, mister. I'm sorry...
- That's OK. Forget it.
Will you take down that fence? I'd like
to get settled before the first race starts.
- OK?
- Sure, mister.
Your attention, please. The horses
are on the track for the second race.
I had this layin' around, mister.
I thought you might like it.
- Thanks. That's very kind of you.
- No trouble at all.
- If you need anything else, just call.
- I doubt I'll need anything,
I'm getting along just fine,
but thanks anyway.
Who you bettin' on?
Anything look good to you?
- Red Lightning.
- Huh?
- Red Lightning in the seventh.
- You're bettin' on him, huh?
Yeah, I got a little bet down on him.
Well, I guess I better
be getting back to work.
- Thanks for bringin' me the programme.
- No trouble at all.
- There's nothing else I can do for you?
- No, nothing at all.
If I think of anything, I'll give you a yell.
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen.
The horses are now on
the track for the seventh race,
the $100,000-added
Lansdowne Stakes, at one mile.
The horses are approaching
the starting gate for the seventh race.
- Sure is a nice day, ain't it?
- Yeah.
I didn't think it would be when I got up
this morning but it turned out real fine.
Kinda funny if you look at it. Weather's
like it always is this time of year, but...
I sure appreciate the way
you treated me, mister.
It's not the money.
Of course, I appreciate that too, but...
- Forget it.
- No, sir. I don't reckon I'll ever forget it.
I brought you some luck. You bet
in this race, you might need it.
Keep your junk and
leave me alone, will you?
Something wrong?
You're wrong, nigger.
Be a nice guy and go on
about your business.
Sure, boss. Sorry to have bothered you
My mistake.
And they're off and running! At the
start it is Red Lightning breaking on top.
Early Streak is second. I'm Hoping
is third. White Fire is fourth.
Little Arnie is next, Seymour's
Darling, and Best Seller.
Down the back stretch, it's Red
Lightning by a length and a quarter.
I'm Hoping is second by
three quarters of a length.
Little Arnie is third by a length
and a quarter, and Seymour's Darling.
At the half-mile post, it is Red
Lightning by a length and a quarter.
I'm Hoping is second by a half a length.
Seymour's Darling is third and Little
Arnie moving past on the outside.
Into the far turn, it is Red Lightning
in front by a length and a quarter.
Little Arnie is second by half a length.
I'm Hoping is third.
And a horse is down! It is Red Lightning.
At the head of the stretch, it is I'm Hoping
taking the lead by half a length...
Wait, stop! Stop, or I'll shoot!
Nicky was dead at 4.24.
At 2.15 that afternoon
Johnny Clay was still in the city.
He knew how long it would take
to drive to the track,
park his car and walk to the grandstand.
He planned to arrive just before
the start of the seventh race.
Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.
The horses are now on
the track for the seventh race,
the $100,000-added
Lansdowne Stakes, at one mile.
The horses are approaching
the starting gate for the seventh race.
Hey! How about some service,
you stupid-looking Irish pig?
Money room. Carter.
Yes, sir, right away.
There's a riot downstairs. C'mon.
They're off and running.
At the start it is Red Lightning breaking
on top. Early Streak is second.
I'm Hoping is third. White Fire is fourth.

Down to the wire it is Little Arnie
going steadily, holding it...
and winning it by three
quarters of a length.
I'm Hoping second by three quarters of a
length, Seymour's Darling third by a head
and White Fire finished fourth.
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen.
Be sure to hold all tickets.
The stewards are conducting
an inquiry into the seventh race
and will view the motion picture.
Get your hands up, all of you! One move
from any of you and I'm gonna start firing.
You. Fill that bag up just
as fast as you know how.
You. Take that gun out of the holster.
Be awful, awful careful how you do it.
Now drop it. Kick it over here.
All right, turn around and face the wall.
All right, now the money in the safe.
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen.
We have received no exact information
concerning the spill of Red
Lightning in the seventh race.
However, jockey Danny
Freed appears to be unhurt.
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen...
Fill it up!
...concerning the spill of Red
Lightning in the seventh race.
However, jockey Danny
Freed appears to be unhurt.
All right, all right, that's enough. Now put
the bag here in the middle of the floor.
Get back over there.
Now, I'm gonna open this door. I want you
to go through it and into the locker room.
And close the door. I'll start firin' through
that door 15 seconds after you close it.
Let's go.
Now close it!
- Just a minute.
- What are you doing?
We interrupt this
broadcast for a news bulletin.
In one of the most daring hold-ups in
history, a bandit wearing a rubber mask
today took an estimated $2,000,000
stuffed into a duffel bag from the offices
of the Lansdowne racetrack. The robbery
occurred during the seventh race
and was timed to coincide with
the shooting of Red Lightning,
just as the horse, valued at $250,000,
was leading the pack at the far turn.
The jockey escaped with minor injuries.
A man identified as Nicky Arano,
who allegedly shot the thoroughbred,
was fatally wounded by track police
as he attempted to shoot
his way out of the parking lot.
At this time the mystery that
still plagues the authorities
is how the bandit got away from the track
with the bulky bag containing the money.
A search of the track is being conducted
in case the money is still hidden there.
And now we take you back to our
regularly-scheduled programme.
No one saw the duffel bag
come out of the window.
Ah, that part of it worked OK.
Landed right at my feet.
I reported my radio out of order
before I went out to the track.
But the Captain's convinced
I was holed up somewhere, drunk.
And if the Captain's convinced, there
ain't nobody that can unconvince him.
Besides, no one's gonna think anything
of seein' a cop at the racetrack.
I mean, they won't get any funny ideas
about it, tie it in with the robbery.
Anyway, if they do it won't cut any ice.
Captain knows I was drunk. And
he ain't a man you can argue with.
So I guess I'll just have to... break down,
admit it, and take my punishment.
Yeah. That'd be terrible, wouldn't it,
Randy? A 30-day suspension.
It's 7.15.
Don't worry. He'll get here. He had to get
the dough at the motel where I dropped it.
There was a funny little guy, name of Joe
Piano there. He runs the place, I guess.
- Sure hope Johnny can pick his friends.
- I need another drink.
Why ain't he here? Everything runs on
a timetable till it comes to payin' us.
Then the timetable breaks down.
He's supposed to be here at seven.
- I think I hear the elevator.
- That'll be Johnny.
- Everybody up.
- What's this?
It'll be a massacre if you don't keep
those mitts up. Now, where's Johnny?
I been in that car since four
o'clock listenin' to that radio.
I heard some pretty interesting things.
Grandpa, what time's Johnny get here?
Somebody gave you a bum steer, buddy.
Look around. Can't believe
you were tipped, huh?
Well, if I had a certain little lady here...
Where's the jerk? Where's George?
The jerk's right here.
Johnny reached the motel.
Due to heavy traffic around the track,
he was 15 minutes behind schedule.
Yeah? Who is it?
Oh, it's, uh... it's just a mistake. I'm sorry.
Johnny arrived at the meeting
place at 7.29, still 15 minutes late.
It had been prearranged that in the
event of an emergency before the split,
the money was to be saved
by whoever had it at that time
with no consideration of the fate of the
others, the money to be divided later.
After what he had seen, not knowing the
cause or the circumstances of the others,
Johnny had no choice but to
save himself and the money.
Ten minutes later he bought
the largest suitcase he could find.
I'm back here, Val, darling.
How'd it go, dear?
-  Watch it, there! Watch out!
- What happened?
Sherry... why? Why did you do it?
Do what, dearest? I was just getting
some clothes ready to go to the cleaners.
You had to be stupid. You couldn't even
play it smart with a gun pointed at you.
Well, you better get smart fast and
get outta here while you can still walk.
But your friend... Val, is that his name?
Yes, and you'd better get out
of here before he gets here.
I'm sick, Sherry. I...
Call an ambulance.
The door's behind you. Take a cab.
I love you, Sherry.
George, you better go on
and go. You look terrible.
It isn't fair.
I never had anybody but you.
Not a real husband.
Not even a man.
Just a... bad joke without a punch line.

Sebastian and I are so ex cited. We haven't
seen Daddy sweetums for a long time.
Will the nice man let us wait outside
so we can look at the airplanes?
Certainly. You can stand outside. We'll be
announcing your husband's flight shortly.
He's a sweetums man. Let's hurry up real
fast and see Daddy come off the airplane.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Mr and Mrs Raymond Preston.
Nine o'clock flight for Boston.
We'll be announcing the on-time
departure of this flight very shortly, sir.
- Any other baggage?
- No, it was checked in this morning.
Oh, say, I wanna carry that bag
with me on the plane, please.
I'm sorry, sir, it's too large. It'll have
to go checked through as baggage.
Oh, now, let's be a little reasonable, huh?
You can't tell me
that the two of us are not entitled to
one piece of luggage between us.
Sir, we have no objection
to one small bag. Even two.
- We have nothing else. It was checked in.
- I see.
It's close to flight time, but we can
locate the rest of your luggage.
- You could transfer the contents...
- No. I'm sorry, that won't work at all.
Let me talk to your supervisor.
All right. I'll be very happy
to call him. Mr Grimes?
Mr Grimes? Could you
come down this way, please?
- Good evening. What can we do for you?
- My wife and I are going to Boston.
Our luggage has been checked through
and I want this in the cabin.
I'm afraid it ex ceeds the maximum size.
Yes, it does look a bit too large
for the passenger compartment.
Sir, those are our regulations,
designed for your comfort and safety.
- I can't make the trip without it.
- You really can't?
- Absolutely not.
- Well, in that case, I think we can, uh...
How about it? It's past cancellation time,
but I think we might stretch a point.
- We'll give you a full rebate, sir.
- Wait a minute. I don't want a rebate!
Sir, I don't know what to suggest. It's near
flight time. There are passengers waiting.
Is the gentleman worried about the
contents? We'd be happy to insure it.
More than happy. If you give me
its value and tell me what's in it.
No, there's nothing in it. I mean, uh,
just personal items, things like that.
All right. All right. Check it through.
Thank you, sir. I'm sure you'll find
the service to your satisfaction.
...the New Englander DC-7
service to Boston at gate eight.
No, no, Sebastian. You mustn't
frighten pretty airplanes.
We go for trip on nice airplane some day.
Sebastian, come back here!
Mr Preston, we'll be
announcing boarding...
Grimes speaking. What?
Oh, you're not serious?
Right out on the runway?
Yes, sir, right away.
Will passenger Preston please report
to the American Airlines ticket counter?

the American Airlines ticket counter?
Taxi!
Johnny, look.
Johnny, you've got to run.
Yeah... What's the difference?
