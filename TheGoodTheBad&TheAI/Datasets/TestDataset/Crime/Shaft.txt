# John Shaft##
Hey, what's up?
Looks like the kid
got clocked with that.
He gonna make it?
Got his head
stove in pretty good.
- Witnesses?
- Nope.
- He come from in there?
- He's dressed like it.
You let anybody leave?
- I know the job.
- Hey, I'm just doing mine.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Was there anything
peculiar? Any commotions?
You just call her and say
what I told you to say.
Hang up the phone.
You don't worry about my father.
You worry about me.
I'm not gonna argue...
- What?
- How did you get that blood?
Blood. What blood?
I'm gonna ask you again.
You give me attitude, I'm gonna
drag you out of here by your hair.
How did you get
that blood on yourself?
It was like...
He started it...
and I finished it.
Mm-hmm.
Look, I was razzin' the guy.
He couldn't take a joke.
So you cracked
his head open. I can dig it.
He left all pissed off.
I followed him out to apologize.
Next thing I know,
he's coming at me with a silver bat.
I was defending myself.
Anybody see you?
No, officer. It was
just me and him out there.
- Do you know who my father is?
- No. Do you?
- Take him out.
-  Let’s go.
What's your name?
- Diane Palmieri.
- What'd you see, Diane?
- Nothing.
- Why you point that guy out to me?
I didn't.
What's that?
What?
Oh...
What did you see,
Diane?
Nothing, I swear.
I...
It's a zoo in here, and if
I'm working, how can I see anything?
Detective. We have
a potential  witness you should see.
I'll be back in a minute.
Keep her company, okay?
He did it.
That racist bastard.
- That's the one that did it.
- How do you know? Did you see it?
No. He was sitting
over there...
and he was hassling Trey from
the minute we walked in the door.
Right this way.
This table over here.
Yo!
Excuse me, sir.
Yo!
- What's up, man?
- They don't serve no malt liquor.
No malt liquor, all right?
No..."Aiight"?
-
- Okay.
- What the hell's your problem?
- Let's go. I wanna go.
No. We're fine.
We're fine, okay?
Don't even worry
about it.
All right.
Have a seat over here.
- What did your friend Trey do?
- Nothing.
He tried to ignore the guy, but
the bastard just wouldn't let up.
No 40's, no Chronic...
and no, uh...
no Indo, "aiight"?
Hey. Hey, dawg,
is you deaf?
- Holler back!
-  What? What an asshole.
You got that, Tupac?
- And then what happened?
- Trey turned the tables on the guy.
- What are you doing?
- He took napkins and a knife...
and he poked holes in it.
- Then he walked over to the guy.
- I think you dropped this.
And he dropped it on his head.
Bull's-eye.
- Dis!
- And everybody laughed.
Take that, chump!
I guess that little prick
was pissed.
He was embarrassed that
all his friends laughed at him.
Thank you.
You can check on your friend now.
- Getting a low pulse.
- We gotta move.
We're losing him.
Let’s get rollin'.
Tell me he is not
the primary on this.
- It's his catch, Lou.
-
Walter Wade, Jr.
You big Walter Wade's son?
- Yes, I am. Correct.
- The real estate developer?
- Daddy's a big man, huh?
- Big man.
Big man.
The waitress.
She saw it, huh?
So what you do, motherfucker,
threaten her?
Oh, uh, she had
to go to the john.
What?
- Where'd she go?
- She left.
Shit!
When we get him on board,
I'm gonna intubate.
Let's get that defib
ready, guys.
He's starting
to seize.
-
- He's having a seizure.
- Homeboy's got rhythm, huh?
- What?
Damn it.
Was it something
I said?
I think
my nose is broke.
I'll clear his airway.
- He broke my nose.
- He's going fast.
There's no air exchange.
Let's get this thing open.
I can't even get a pulse right now.
Damn,
we're losing him!
-  Son of a bitch!
-  Trey!
I've been waiting
for this all year.
You are gone
from this precinct.
Gone? For what?
For that?
His roots in the community couldn't
go deeper. He has no record.
Your Honor,
the charge is homicide.
Not having done it before
is not an excuse.
Bail is set
at $200, 000.
-  That don't mean shit!
-
You're a killer, man!
Fuck you!
Can I get a statement
from you?
- Shaft.
- It's Walter Wade.
Thanks for breaking
my nose that night.
My lawyer says
that's why I got bail...
and that's precisely why
I'm skiing in Switzerland right now.
See you when
I see you, slick.
Oh, oh.
Aw, come on, man. You suck.
Shh.
##
- John Shaft.
- Carmen Vasquez.
Welcome to Narcotics.
- Jimmy Groves.
- Jack Roselli.
You transfer in
from the 3-5?
Yeah.
You John Shaft, huh?
- Heard you quit.
- Not yet.
Luger, hurry
the fuck up, man.
Come on,
you bitch bastard.
Come on, you Billy Bob motherfucker.
Open the god damn door.
Let’s go.
Open the door.
- ##
- That's three Happy Meals or four?
-  That's four. And hurry up.
- All right.
Freeze, motherfuckers!
Don't move!
Move your fucking ass
out of the way!
Freeze, goddamn it!
Police! Everybody
on the fucking ground!
Everybody freeze! Grab that
motherfucker! On the floor! Now!
Somebody turn
that fucking music off!
- ##
-  Put your hands behind your back.
Oh, no habla Ingles. Now you can't
speak no fucking English.
I bet you can say
"kilo," can't you?
Hey!
Hey, goddamn it! Hey!
Don't make me chase you!
You're gonna piss me off!
Stop, goddamn it!
Stop!
I told you to stop,
man!
Aah!
Ayudame!
Ayudame!
Ayudame!
Throw something else!
Throw something else!
Disperse, motherfuckers!
Disperse now!
Come on! Come on!
Watch your backs,
ladies!
Abran la puerta!
Abran la puerta!
Abranme! Abranme!
I'm gonna fuck you up
for making me run!
You caught me.
You got me, Papa.
Peace,
motherfucker.
! Suerte!
April fool,
motherfucker.
I told you not
to make me run, didn't I?
This shit's
too tight, yo!
Just sit and think about
this ass-whupping you're gonna get.
It's gonna be
a long ride to the precinct.
Paraphernalia.
Nothing.
- Let me call my wife.
- Shut up, corn bread.
- Let me call my girlfriend.
- I said shut the fuck up.
Easy with the braids, man. What
you got against black men anyway?
Supposed to be
like a factory up there.
They must've
gotten a heads-up from someone.
My kid's got more
indictable shit under his bed.
These scales'll get revolved
before we clock out tonight.
- Look at him.
- Who's that?
Peoples Hernandez.
He's the neighborhood alligator.
It's all his play up here. He’s got
about half a dozen apartments.
Keeps changing his shit on us
like it's a shell game.
You enjoying the show?
Yo, let me see the ball.
John, don't do it. Come on.
John, come on. No!
Good shot.
Peoples Hernandez,
come on down!
Motherfuck.
Yes!
Uh-oh, Shaft.
You pissed him off now.
- Here come the troops.
-
This is Egyptian cotton,
motherfuck.
Two-twenty thread. This is like half
your shitty-assed paycheck, okay?
Step off, Peoples.
You wouldn't know Egyptian cotton
if Pharaoh himself sent it to you,
you knock-off wearing
motherfucker.
You best sleep
in that vest.
Oh, there you go, papi. You're under
arrest for assaulting an officer.
- Stay, Lucifer.
-
-
-
This is the only way
you can touch me.
You're one pathetic
Kentucky Fried nigga.
- I got some chicken wing for you.
- Uh-uh-uh.
What have we got here?
Concealed weapon.
- The Iceman Goethe.
- Goethe for a long time.
Come on.
Step up.
-
-  On the hop. Let’s go.
- Peoples. Peoples.
- Can I get my shoes shined?
Yeah, you sure can.
Home sweet home, huh?
- Stay still, please.
- Yo, Shaft.
I'm gonna put so many
lawyers on your ass...
you're gonna think they opened
a branch office up there.
Lawyers? Lawyers
are for punetas.
- I thought you were gonna smoke me.
- I smoke Camels.
It's not my size.
Yo, when the van comes
for these assholes,
this one gets
the busted seat belt.
What the hell's he doing here?
Tell me it's something good.
Tell me it ain't one
of your dick-arounds.
No. Honest to God, Lou.
I was in fear for my life.
- Yeah, yeah. I know the routine.
- Shut the fuck up, corn bread.
Yo, Luger, what's up
with the corn bread?
Your problem is what?
Nazis with badges.
That's my problem.
Nazis?
Oh, you gotta lighten up, Shaft.
I talk like this
all the time.
I see your point.
Maybe I should take an ethnic
sensitivity workshop, huh?
- Fuck you.
- I should workshop my foot up your ass.
- How about that?
- You pick a color, black or blue?
- Hey, fuck you, Luger.
- How about I make you both, Luger?
- Anytime, anywhere.
- Nothing between us but air...
- Anytime, anywhere, Shaft.
- Come on, motherfucker. - Go, go!
- I like the way you handled that.
- Shut the fuck up!
Yo, Shaft, you got a call.
Guy says it's urgent.
I think it's the clinic.
Your test results may have come.
Today we find out if I'm
your daddy or the German shepherd.
Ooh, pretty good.
Well, how good is good?
You're kidding me.
Red, if this is
another one of your...
Solid info?
One hundred percent solid?
No shit.
Where?
Mm-hmm.
All right. I got it.
All right. Thanks.
I gotcha.
- What's up?
- Old business.
- You need backup?
- No, I got it.
- Rasaan.
- What?
- I'm calling in a favor, son.
- Favor, my ass, motherfucker.
You ain't got no favors
left with me, dawg.
Them shits is through.
You done ran all your shits out.
Look, nigga, don't argue.
Just do it.
All right, dawg.
What, Rasaan?
What happened?
I gotta do a favor real quick.
How you doing?
Let's get going.
How you doing,
Richie Rich?
Remember me?
Refresh my memory.
Put 'em on.
Yeah, what's the dilli?
Where we off to?
- Fifteenth precinct.
- Okay, dawg.
Hey, yo, that's my dawg Shaft
back there. I mean, that's my man.
Word up.
You all right?
Cold, chilly?
You want a jacket or something?
I bet you thought
I was sneaking back in.
Crown Heights! Bed-Stuy!
Yeah! Bed-Stuy!
I'm innocent.
You look depressed, Shaft.
You depressed?
Back away from the car.
Back away from the car.
Fuck with the bull...
You get the horns!
Yeah, Shaft!
Go on, baby! Yeah!
You the man, Shaft!
You the man!
You the man, Shaft!
You know, bro,
I'll be out in an hour.
I don't think so,
running man.
The van to central processing
left about five minutes ago...
and there won't
be another one for hours and hours.
By the time you get downtown, we're
talking overnight in the tombs,
and they definitely won't
arraign your ass before morning.
It's a shame we didn't
get here a little sooner.
You look depressed, Walter.
You depressed?
Yo, Peeps, you still here?
The seat belt on the van
was busted.
- Aw, damn.
- It's called habeas corpus...
That mean "due process,"
for the illiterate.
It's called, "you wanted
to play games with me," Peoples.
I know
a shitload of games.
You boys play nice.
Teflon Don, nigga!
Teflon!
Bitch.
Hey, blanqui,
what he get you for?
Income tax evasion?
- Fuck you.
-
Damn!
- What's happening, player?
- What's up, big boy?
Same old same old.
Congratulations, man. You was on TV.
- Let me get your autograph.
- Uh-huh.
You a star.
Mr. P., how you be?
Ah, fi ne, fi ne.
- Who's winning?
-  Who do you think?
- Hey.
- Congratulations, baby.
Lucky man.
Alice, Alice,
ease up on my nephew.
Or that boy's gonna poke
a hole in something.
Uncle J!
Mr. Big-time private eye.
Hey, I earned my pay today.
Well, you did bring him in.
There's no denying that.
But what?
But what?
Come on, come on. Spit it out.
Nothing, nothing. So when you gonna
come on board with me, my man?
- Soon.
- Soon?
You're always saying that.
Got a fuckin' nigga locked up!
Fuck, nigga!
What's wrong with you?
You better
watch your back!
- We shouldn't fuckin' be here, man!
- We got busted, man!
- The same bust!
- You makin' too much money!
Give me your shoes.
They wouldn't fit you.
Oh, shit!
I only ask once.
You want my shoes?
For two years now,
I've been meaning to ask you.
When you dress like this, where
exactly do you strap your piece?
You mean
you forgot already?
Well, you know it was
way back in the day.
Oh, yeah.
Maybe you should ask Lamont.
Why I gotta ask Lamont?
I'm standing right here.
Damn, nigga! Why you
always up on my woman?
This is the type offshoot
that get a motherfucker killed.
I was asking
a legitimate-ass question.
Why is it every time you see me
talking to her, you roll up on me?
- You feeling insecure?
- Lamont, he’s just kidding.
I ain't studying this bullshit.
We can settle this shit right now!
- Back off the motherfuckin' Armani.
- Fuck you and your Armani!
Surprise!
We got you, baby.
We got you. Surprise, baby.
Do you want a smoke?
Don't smoke. Thanks.
My name is Peoples.
You know why
they call me that?
'Cause "ch-you" always takes care
of "ch-your" peoples?
Yeah, actually,
more or less.
You play golf?
- Not for a while.
- Golf is phat.
Tiger Wood.
Tiger Wood.
I like him.
- You got a boat?
- I had one.
What kind of boat you had?
A Boston Whaler.
Boston Whaler.
You been around
the world, right?
- Yeah.
- You know something?
I got money
longer than train smoke.
I never been on an airplane
in my whole goddamn life.
Let me ask you something.
The, uh...
Cinco familia.
Five family, five borough,
one love.
Okay.
You an interesting
motherfuck.
You got like a...
business card or something?
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Don't kiss me,
motherfucker.
- Good night.
- Later, dawg.
...back in custody tonight after
a two-year flight from justice.
Wade, seen here after
his arraignment in 1998,
was rearrested
by Detective John Shaft...
as he few into Westchester
County Airport tonight.
I don't get it.
Why the fuck did he come back?
If it was me,
I'd never come back.
Yeah, see, if there ever
was a "but what?" that'd be it.
Comes to justice, that kid's
old man's got enough juice...
to slip his thumb on the scale
and nobody'll say nothing.
Mmm. Ain't no fucking way
he walks from this.
- No way.
- Really?
Let's roll.
-  Goodnight.
- Night, all.
Such a cynical motherfucker.
You wanna come home
with me tonight?
- It's been a while.
- So what is it this time?
You just wanna be held,
or you want the L.D.?
What you think it is?
I want the L.D., baby.
And then I wanna be held.
- That's all right with you?
- You know me.
It's my duty
to please that booty.
Finish up. Let's go.
Kearney,
how's retirement?
- Catfish are jumpin'.
- Heard you bought a big house.
- Four-bedroom Colonial on the water.
- Let me ask you something.
How does a pencil-pushing,
apple-stealing, dickhead like you...
afford a four-bedroom Colonial
in Nassau motherfucking County?
How much did they
pay you, Kearney?
After working a job
uptown for 28 years,
you know what I like best
about where I live?
How do I say this?
It's a restricted community.
Your Honor, my client did not
fly home 5,000 miles to jump bail.
You mean jump bail again.
No doubt.
He was in the wind
for two years, Judge.
If he decides to take off again, the
mood of the people in this city...
Talk about the people!
We can't risk the possibility...
of waiting another two years,
two months, two days, two hours.
The District Attorney’s office
is ardently opposed to bail.
- How about no bail?
- Remove that man.
- Get him out of here.
- Hey, back up, son! Back up, son!
Hey, son. Hey, yo,
you gonna get your ass twisted.
You better get off me!
Your point is well taken,
Mr. Torres.
Defendant is ordered to surrender
his passport to this court.
However, I believe
that young Mr. Wade...
is sincere in his desire to deal
with whatever form of judgment...
this room deems necessary
to deliver.
- Bail is set at one million dollars.
- What?
- No!
- My client is prepared to post bail.
Oh, no!
What the fuck is wrong with you?
- I'm out. I'm done.
- What are you, nuts?
- Come on, John. This is whack.
- Fuck the job!
- I'll get him my own goddamn way.
- Ah! Insane!
- Hey, hey!
- All right, I'm cool.
I quit.
I remember when I took that job
thinking I could fight from inside,
and you telling me
about all the problems.
That color thing... Too black for the
uniform, too blue for the brothers.
About how justice gets tangled up in
red tape or bought off by the green.
You were right.
Fuck that job. Fuck the badge.
I'll get that silver-spoon
motherfucker my own way.
- No lawyers, politics, no rules.
- No pension.
- What?
- You're too hot, step off a bit.
- Let me put my people on him.
- No. Hell no.
- His ass is mine.
- Hey, what's the difference?
Got is got.
His ass... is mine.
-  We're in pretty good shape.
- What about the waitress?
Paul, talk to him.
Thank you.
The truth is, Walter,
we can't find her.
This guy is great.
Do you know why we can't finder?
'Cause she doesn't want
to be found.
Do you want to go back to
Switzerland while we track her down?
It could take a year,
two, ten, maybe never.
Meanwhile, everything
and everyone else is in place.
I don't believe this.
Even if she does surface,
she is seriously damaged goods.
It’s just a roll
of the dice, kid.
I'll roll
my own damn dice.
Now, Walter...
Walter...
- Oh, hello. How are you?
- Hello, my darling.
-  How was your day?
- Is that my mother's choker?
- Oh, well, uh...
- You gave her my mother’s jewelry?
Well, let me... Walter.
Walter.
Walter.
- Walter!
-
Hi, Miss Palmieri.
Remember me?
Look, I really need
to talk to Diane.
She don't live here.
She lives in the Bronx.
Yeah, I checked
the last address I had.
Well, right now
she's in Europe.
- Europe? Where in Europe?
- Spain.
- I love Spain.
- Maybe Italy.
I never know till I get
the postcard. What can I tell you?
Hey, okay.
Thanks.
I'll probably get fired for this,
but I thought you might need help.
Terry.
From Metronome, right?
- Remember me?
- Yeah.
How did you find me?
I'm free on Monday nights, Tuesday
nights and every other Wednesday.
Read my mind.
Why am I here?
- You're looking for Diane?
- Got it.
- What's in it for me?
- What you need?
-  Fuck that bitch!
- Look down the corner.
See that little nigga,
the one with the red hat?
That's Malik, okay?
Now, my son Tony,
he's a real good boy.
A good student.
But he's 12, and I caught him twice
last week running errands for Malik.
I need for that to stop.
Can you handle that?
Everybody on fucking drugs!
Nothin' but money!
That's Monday, Tuesday
and every other Wednesday.
- Right?
- You got it, baby.
Mmm.
Fucking haves and
the should not haves, motherfucker.
Who is the fuck
is to say I shouldn't have shit?
Anybody looking to maintain
their employment with the N.Y.P.D.,
it might be in their
best interest to leave now.
Yo!
Down! Down!
Down! Down!
Man, leave him alone.
- What's my name?
- What?
- What's my name?
- I don't know.
- John Shaft!
- What?
- John Shaft! Say it!
- John Shaft.
There's a kid lives up the block
about 12 named Tony. Know him?
- Yeah.
- Wrong answer!
There's a kid lives down the block
about 12 named Tony. Know him?
- Nah, I don't know that kid.
- Stay!
- Quit pointing the gun!
- This kid you don't know.
You see him coming, you run
for your motherfuckin' life.
- Do you ever wanna see me again?
- No.
- Do you ever wanna see me again?
- No!
- What's my name?
- I forgot.
- What's my name?
- John Shaft. John Shaft.
John Shaft, yo.
You ever wanna see me...
Oh, you answered that, huh?
My bad.
What? What?
Fuck all that!
Fuck all of you!
- Give that back to me, man.
- It worked out great.
Yeah. Okay.
Hey, hey, hey, guys.
Break it up.
- You're fighting over rubber?
- He started it.
No, you always start it.
Here. Jump for it, okay?
And behave.
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way.
Get the fuck out of the road!
What are you fucking doing,
you crackhead?
##
Leon, the minute she shows up,
you call me, right?
Yeah. All right.
How you gonna get me into the police
academy with you chuckin' your job?
- Who lost your rap sheet for you?
- You.
- Who got you that Jets tryout?
- You.
- Who got you that gig at the club?
- You.
- Who delivers ten times out often?
- All right, dawg. You.
So shut the fuck up
and call me when she shows.
Why the hell you wanna
be a cop any...
Forget I asked.
Got milk?
I got some milk. You want some milk?
I got a whole bunch of milk.
Mira, I am telling you,
Jeter hit one home run,
two doubles
and he walk once.
He walk once.
-
-
Y- Y- You dressing down
to blend in or something?
You look like
a fucking duck hunter.
I need someone located.
Located?
What you mean, found?
Located
and then what?
That's gonna cost you.
What am I, a pawnbroker?
I had it all appraised.
It'll cash out to about 40,000.
- Stole?
- Inherited.
Inherited?
- Forty thousand?
- Uh-huh.
Yo, Peoples,
it's him.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Th-Th-That's you.
Cono, man.
He's fucking famous.
Hundreds of people
were outside the courthouse...
protesting the judge’s decision
to grant bail.
The case continues to arouse
fierce passions in this city.
The trial is scheduled
to begin in two weeks.
We are, of course, following
this case very closely...
to bring you
the latest developments.
Flaco, Flaco, Flaco, we got
Hollywood right here in the house.
Whoo-hoo.
I gotta tell you
something.
In this neighborhood,
I am the motherfucking king snake.
I do like this... on 181,
three people die on Riverside.
But the thing of it is,
you know,
I go downtown to take
a girl out, show her the sights.
I walk into a restaurant,
my stomach's in a knot,
my teeth is clenched,
my hands is in fists.
I don't fit in down there.
People look at me, size me up.
So ten minutes into it,
I can’t wait to come back home.
- I'm like a prisoner, you know?
- Okay.
But you...
See, I would kill
to be you.
Go where you go.
Do what you do.
So this is
what I propose.
Okay, the jewelry and shit... go hock
the flash, bring me the cash.
I'm not
gonna not take it.
But what I really want...
I want you to start
taking me downtown with you.
I want you to start
taking me wherever you go.
You mean like, uh,
hang out together?
"Hang out." That's good.
Take you to Lutece, the Harvard Club?
What are you talking about?
No, no, no, no, no.
When I say "me,"
"me" is this.
Oh. Hi.
I want you to front for me,
be my face.
Get me
some upscale customers.
I would like that
very much.
You get me into your world,
I do that bitch for you.
Word is bond.
Man, you're doing a little bit
too much of your own product.
- What?
- Look, it's 40, 000.
I thought it was gonna be more,
but that's what it is.
If it's really
important to you,
you can tell everybody you got
a rich white boy on a rope.
I really don't care.
But entrenous?
No fuckin' way.
Oye. What's up, Peoples?
Let me keep this.
You know,
you took a big risk...
coming here
all by yourself.
Did I?
- Yo, Peoples, can I keep this?
- No.
- Forty thousand?
- That's what I said.
But this other thing,
you can't do for me?
Not on your life.
Not on my life?
- Let me live. Let me keep that ice.
- No.
The man gonna need it
to raise some money.
You drive a hard bargain,
blanquito.
Where the fuck did he go?
Hey!
What is wrong with you, sneakin'
around behind me? You wanna die?
- Hey. Come on. Con calma, cono.
- Get in the car.
He had this, uh, chabo...
money belt...
stuffed with rocks.
Peoples tell him to cash it in
and, vaya que bien, done deal.
You talkin' about Walter Wade,
the white boy, right?
Si, si, anglo blanquito
from the television.
They're gonna kill
that white girl.
Cono, man.
- What's up? - Gettin' to know
the lay of the land. How you doin'?
Yeah, I'm havin'
a conversation here.
- The courthouse was rough shit.
- Right, right.
- You sure you're all right?
- Yeah, I'm cool.
? Cono, man!
Me voy, huh?
Hey, Shaft,
I heard you quit la policia.
So I don't think it's right
I gotta do this shit anymore.
Okay, okay.
Okay, Shaft, okay.
Mariconaso.
This guy
comes in here,
he's got his drawers stuffed
with jewelry and he asks me,
"Can you locate somebody?"
And I say yeah, because he's
kinda like a celebrity, you know.
You don't want to say no. His coming
to me, it's all fattering and shit.
The truth of it is, finding people,
that's not really my forte.
So this is what I propose.
You detectives and shit,
right?
You detect.
So why don't I
subcontract to you?
The guy says the shit'll cash out to
With you I split it
down the middle... 50-50.
Easiest money
you'll ever make.
You take half,
I take half.
Ten large?
Ten thousand.
All you gotta do
is tell me where she's at.
Then what happens?
Easiest money
you'll ever make.
You wanna tell him about Tattoo?
Uh, can I talk to you
for a moment?
What?
- Wonder what the market did today.
- How the fuck should I know?
-  All the white boys.
-  Get the fuck outta here!
Solo lo blanquito.
Sabes, sonso, como es...
Diablo.
I heard
you need a job.
But this?
You know when guys like you
go down for good?
When they get aspirations.
When they try and rise
above their station.
Now, this contract killin' thing
you got with Walter Jr...
Do yourself a favor.
You're a two-bit, three-block
dope dealer. Stick to what you know.
Calmate.
Stick to what I know?
Fuck you, motherfucker.
I'm a star.
Yo soy elmeyeme.
You ain't shit. You ain't
even a fuckin' pig no more.
Do you think that makes me
less dangerous or more dangerous?
Now, I see you somewhere
I think you don't belong,
I will kill you.
Calmate.
Calmate.
Mira, mira, mira, mira.
Look.
I respect you.
I like you.
That why you always
wanna fuck me?
Tenga un buen dia.
Puta, why you finch?
Ms. Palmieri.
Wait here.
Motherfuckers!
She didn't see nothin',
and she ain't gonna testify.
- Stay the fuck away from my sister!
- No guns! Take it easy!
Well, if your sister didn't see
anything, why's she runnin' so hard?
- Just leave her be.
- Wade threaten her again?
- Don't move.
- This is fuckin' bullshit!
- Look, I can take care of that.
- Leave her be.
Frankie.
Mikey.
Ma, go back in the house.
We just wanna talk to her.
Yeah, sure, with those guns.
Get lost.
What do you think?
- They shot a blank.
- Nothin', right?
-
-
Nada.
Come on, Shaft.
Lead us to that waitress.
I think we're being tailed.
Roselli and Groves.
They're following us?
They saw me with Tattoo
last night.
Now Peoples is probably
payin' 'em to find Diane.
So, yeah,
they're following us.
First Walter, Peoples.
Now these two.
They like to
fuck with people, huh?
I'm gonna have to show 'em what
fuckin' with people's all about.
- What you starin' at, bitch?
- Punk-ass!
Hey, you better
keep steppin', motherfucker.

"No tengo dinero, boss."
Do I look like

That's like... that's like an act
of God. You know, obra de Dios.

Dangerous times are here now.
You got to watch your back too.

Yo, yo, give me Peoples, man.

Motherfucker,

Mr. Big-time Shaft.
I tell you, before we get
up in here I'm gon' warn y'all.
I gave the cleaning lady
a few years off.
You know, let her
get her shit together.
Once I pick some of this shit up,
lightsome candles and incense,
everything'll
be just cool.
Goddamn, Rasaan, this is
like a biohazard in here.
You're welcome.
Why don't you sit down, relax.
You first.
That's nasty.
What?
Sit down.
Go ahead. Sit down.
Man, this is
some repugnant shit.
Hermanito.
- Fuck!
- Aaaah!
Aah! Wait!
What the fuck is g... Whoa!
You come, next thing I know
Shaft put my brother in a box.

Huh? Huh?
No! Aaah! Aaah!
I come back later,
put this in your ass.
Aaah!
You fuckin'...
Hey, Carmen,
I got John Shaft on the line.
Yeah, Peoples.
Prospect Place and Park Place.
We'll sit tight
in case he makes a move.
Let's go!
Let's go!
What about the blow?
Yo, Ras.
Hey, yo, big man.
What are you doin' over there?
Come on.
Let's get going over there.
Yeah, real funny.
- I wanna check on my brother.
- All right, paisan.
Go check
on your fratello.
Look, it’s just
the two of us here.
You saw it, didn't you?
And it's like a big, fat stone
layin' on your chest.
You gotta let go of it,
Diane.
Trust me on this.
Just let it go.
I was on my break.
I went out front
to have a cigarette.
I was out there
about ten minutes.
I see the black kid, Trey,
comin 'out, and he was pissed.
Talkin 'to himself,
like, pacin' and cursin'.
He didn't see me.
Then, like...
a minute later
the Wade guy comes out.
He doesn't
even break stride.
He snatches up this silver,
I don’t know, pole.
And the Trey kid turns to him,
and he saw him.
He saw it comin'.
Just bashes him.
The spray, you know.
Blood.
Oh!
Then he sees me.
Wade.
I wanted to run.
My legs wouldn't move.
And he comes over
and pushes me.
- Aah!
- Give me your wallet.
I didn't understand.
Diane Palmieri.
You see that? Huh?
You want a taste of that?
You want a taste?
You're gonna go back inside,
you're gonna
finish your shift.
Then you're gonna go home.
Somebody will call you
later tonight.
Do you understand me?
I don’t even remember
going back inside.
I remember talkin' to you,
I remember duckin' out
the back and goin' home,
and I got a call
like he said I would.
Some guy.
Very smooth, very...
And the next day
I just started runnin'.
I been kinda runnin'
ever since.
Okay.
Now here's the good news.
You are about
to stop running.
- This trial is gonna...
- You don't get it, do you?
I took money.
Uh...
The man who called me offered me
$100,000 to get lost...
half right then, and half after
the disposition of the case.
And I said yes.
Itook$50, 000,
and disappeared.
See, I told myself,
I pointed him out to you.
I fingered that son of a bitch,
and I got him arrested.
And I told myself
that was enough.
But obviously it wasn't.
I mean, obviously.
I'm so sorry.
These last two years,
they must've been hell
on you.
What?
I could be home
trading stocks on the Internet.
- I could be watching the Knicks.
- Yeah.
Oh, shit!
- Could she know about us?
- How the fuck do I know?
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- She's coming this way.
Play it easy.
Stay with me.
Yeah.
- How you doin'?
- Hey. Hey.
- What are you guys doin' here?
- Watching your back.
I just got here.
My back?
Your back, Shaft's back.
You know.
Well, he never said
where he was gonna be.
The drums.
You hear things.
Drums?
He picked a pretty tough
neighborhood to lay low in.
- You wearin' your vest?
- Nah.
Jesus Christ!
Hey!
- Shit.
-  Police business.
- Police business.
- What the fuck you shootin' at now?
Shootin' at your ass
