An article, which I believe
appeared in a newspaper,
asked why, since you are,
or it would seem that you are in effect,
the mayor of Chicago,
you've not simply been
appointed to that position.
Well, I'll tell you, you know, it's touching.
Like a lot of things in life,
we laugh because it's funny,
and we laugh because it's true.
Some people say, "Put that man in jail.
What does he think he is doing?"
What I hope I'm doing...
here's where your English paper's got a point...
is I'm responding to the will of the people.
People will drink.
We all know that.
And all I do is act on that.
All this talk of bootlegging...
What is bootlegging?
On the boat, it's bootlegging.
On Lake Shore Drive, it's hospitality.
I'm a businessman.
And what of your reputation
that you control your business through violence,
that those that don't purchase your products
are dealt with violently?
It's all right.
I grew up in a tough neighborhood.
We used to say, you can get further
with a kind word and a gun
than with just a kind word.
In that neighborhood, it might have been true.
Sometimes a reputation follows you.
There is violence in Chicago, of course,
but not by me and not by anybody I employ
because it's not good business.
Leave us alone down here.
We're getting along fine.
We have everything we need.
The green beer you're peddling ain't any good.
It ain't supposed to be good.
It's supposed to be bought.
I'm not buying any.
Don't worry about it, Pops.
We won't come back.
And how's everyone
at your house today?
They're fine.
Your mama well?
She has a little cold.
Oh, she does, huh?
I'm sorry to hear that.
But she'll be all right.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Oh, that's all right, sweetie.
You be careful crossing the street.
Mister!
Mister!
Hey, mister!
Wait!
Mister, wait!
You forgot your brief...
Yes. I heard it on the radio.
I know.
Now it's time to go to work.
Go make a good first impression.
I love you, Eliot.
Now, shoo.
Eliot Ness...
special agent of the Treasury Department.
Mr. Ness.
Thank you, Chief.
At the request of the city of Chicago,
the federal government,
specifically the Department of the Treasury,
has inaugurated a program
to deal with the flow of illegal liquor
and the violence it creates.
Of what does this program consist?
I and other Treasury agents
will work with the Chicago police and other...
Isn't this just another showpiece program?
What do you think about prohibition, Mr. Ness?
Do you drink, Mr. Ness?
Answer the questions.
It's not a showpiece.
And I'll tell you
exactly how I feel about prohibition.
It's the law of the land.
Do you consider yourself a crusader?
What qualifications do you have?
Do you have any political ambitions?
All right, boys.
That's enough.
Excuse me.
Mr. Ness. What are your real plans?
You'll have to read about it in the paper.
Listen, let me ride along with you.
No. Can't help you.
Mr. Ness. Lieutenant Olveson, the flying squad.
Are you ready to meet the men?
Well...
Yes, I am.
I have one more thing to say.
I know that many of you take a drink.
What you've done before today is not my concern.
But now we must be pure,
and I want you to stop.
It's not a question
of whether or not it's a harmless drink.
It's against the law, gentlemen.
As we are going to enforce the law,
we must do first by example.
Are there any questions?
Good.
The Department of the Treasury
has had a man undercover here for some time.
We've received word from this informant
of a large shipment of
Canadian whiskey to Chicago.
I hope you've signed on for some action.
You're going to get it.
Remember, the liquor cases are marked
with a red maple leaf.
Yes, sir.
The Treasury agent is in a gray suit.
He is not to be arrested.
A gray suit.
I think that's about it.
Are your men ready?
Yes, sir. They are.
Good.
At ease.
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.
How are we doing?
O.K.
Want part of a sandwich?
No, thank you, sir.
You nervous?
No, sir.
Been with the unit long?
A short while.
I suppose we all want to do well.
Yes, sir.
A message from my wife.
You married?
Yes, sir, I am.
Nice to be married, huh?
What is it?
Just follow me.
Federal officer.
Hands in the air.
Get them up.
Drop it.
I can't...
Mr. Ness.
Look, I was just...
Jeez, I'm sorry.
Listen, listen.
I can do a lot for you.
I get the big scoop.
You make a big splash.
Get yourself some support.
What do you say?
Let me help you.
O.K. Just shut up.
All right, now!
Let's do some good!
Let's get 'em.
Come on, guys.
Hold it right there!
Federal officer.
You're under arrest
for violations of the Volstead Act.
Preseuski.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
No one's allowed in here.
Mr. Ness!
It's all right.
Let... Let him through here.
You want to take your picture?
Take it now.
You ready?
Ready.
Liquor, huh?
Get him out of here.
Tear the place apart.
I mean now!
Get him out!
Yes, sir.
That means you, too.
Now, what do you think you're doing? Hmm?
You want to throw your garbage?
Throw it in the damn trash basket.
Don't you have more important things to do?
Yeah.
But I'm not doing them right now.
We understand each other?
O.K., pal, why the mahoska?
Why are you packing the gun?
I'm a Treasury officer.
All right.
Just remember what we talked about, now.
Hey. Wait a minute.
What kind of police you have in this damn city?
You turned your back on an armed man.
You're a Treasury officer.
How do you know?
I just told you that.
Who would claim to be that who was not?
What's your name and unit?
It's right here.
You got a beef?
What is it?
How did you know I had a gun?
What, you want a free lesson in police work?
No.
Are you O.K., pal?
I had a rough day on the job.
Ah.
Are you going home now?
I was about to.
Well, then you just fulfilled
the first rule of law enforcement.
Make sure when your shift is over,
you go home alive.
Here endeth the lesson.
We got $100,000 there for 40 barrels.
Make sure there are no empties.
I'll give you the ledger.
Everything is in the book.
It's Eddie.
Come in, Eddie.
So he gets into the snowplow, and he says,
"Let's do some good."
And then we bust through...
Mr. Ness?
Yes?
I came here to thank you.
It was...
my little girl that got killed with that bomb.
I'm... I'm sorry.
Please.
I'm... I'm so sorry.
You see, it's...
because I know that you have children, too...
and that this is real for you
that these men caused this tragedy.
And I know you will put a stop to them.
I know you'll do that now.
What do you want?
I'd like to talk to you.
Come in.
I need a small group of men, starting with you...
Ness, I am just a poor beat cop.
Now, how can *I* help *you*?
Just work with me.
But why should I, though?
Because you're a good cop.
How do you know that?
You told me.
Oh. I'm such a good cop.
How come I'm walking
the beat then, at my age?
You want to tell me?
Maybe I'm that whore with a heart of gold
or the one good cop in the bad town.
Is that what you want to hear?
You want to stay on the beat, you do that.
If you'd like to come with me, I need your help.
I'm asking you for help.
Well, it's the thing you fear, isn't it?
Mr. Ness, I wish I'd met you
but I just think it got more important to me
to stay alive.
And that's why I'm walking the beat.
Thank you, no.
That's good, Andy.
Let's start her up and take a little ride.
I want to hear that Stutz-Bearcat engine.
Let me open the door.
Upsy-Daisy.
Pick up the door there, Andy.
Throw it in the backseat.
Let me get the thing started.
Yeah, start up.
Holy mackerel, Andy.
Listen to that Bearcat motor.
Yeah. Sound like the bear's
chasing that cat all around.
Andy, she's boiling over.
Mr. Ness?
Yes.
Oscar Wallace.
Uh-huh.
I've been assigned here by the Washington bureau.
Really?
Yes.
Well, I'm glad to have you here, Mr. Wallace.
Uh, excuse me.
We're a little in the dark here,
but any ideas you may have...
Actually, yes, sir, I do.
The one I want to try first is this.
He has not filed a return since 1926.
A return.
An income tax return.
Income tax.
Yes, sir.
What do you do at the bureau, Mr. Wallace?
Oh, I'm an accountant.
Accountant?
Yes, sir. And the bureau has sent me here...
Would you excuse me?
Please.
O.K., let's go.
Where are we going?
These walls have ears.
You said you wanted to know
how to get Capone.
Do you really want to get him?
You see what I'm saying?
What are you prepared to do?
Everything within the law.
And then what are you prepared to do?
If you open the ball on these people,
you must be prepared to go all the way.
They won't stop fighting
until one of you is dead.
I want to get Capone.
You want Capone?
Here's how.
He pulls a knife, you pull a gun.
He sends one of yours to the hospital,
you send one of his to the morgue.
That's how you get Capone.
Now, do you want to do that?
Are you ready to do that?
I'm making you a deal.
Do you want this deal?
I have sworn to put this man away
with any and all legal means at my disposal,
and I will do so.
Well, the Lord hates a coward.
Do you know what a blood oath is, Mr. Ness?
Yes.
Good. Because you just took one.
How did Capone know about
your raid the other night?
Some cop told him.
Right.
Welcome to Chicago.
This town stinks like a whorehouse at low tide.
Now, the first thing is, who can you trust?
Nobody.
The cops -- nobody.
Because nobody wants you here.
Then why are you helping me?
Because I swore to uphold the law.
And if you believe that, I'll tell you another.
Now, who can you trust?
You trust nobody.
That's the solid truth.
Then where are we going to get help?
If you're afraid of getting a rotten apple,
don't go to the barrel.
Get it off the tree.
Get it off the tree.
Finger on the trigger guard!
Eject those cartridges!
Clear it all around!
Stand back!
About face!
Barry, I want you to meet Mr. Eliot Ness.
Treasury Department.
How are you?
We need a recruit for extended duty.
He's to be seconded to the Treasury Department.
We have the cooperation of...
Who is consistently this class' best shot?
Williamson and Stone.
Please call them out...
But one at a time.
Is either man married?
No.
Good.
Williamson!
You're married.
I don't want any married men.
All right.
Stand easy, son.
I want to ask you something.
Why do you want to join the force?
To protect and s-s...
and s... To protect and serve.
To protect...
Please don't search for the yearbook answer.
Say what you think.
Well, what I think?
Yeah.
I could help...
with the force.
You can help?
The force.
With crime.
Thank you.
There goes the next chief of police.
At ease!
Stone.
Out here.
This kid's a prodigy.
Why do you want to join the force?
To protect the property and the citizenry...
Don't waste my time with that bullshit.
Where are you from, Stone?
From the South Side.
Stone.
George Stone.
That's your name?
What's your real name?
That is my real name.
Nah. What was it before you changed it?
Giuseppe Petri.
Jeez, I knew it.
All you need is one thieving wop on the team.
What's that you say?
I said that you're a lying member
of a no-good race.
It's much better than you,
you stinking Irish pig.
Oh, I like him.
Yeah, I like him, too.
You just joined the Treasury Department, son.
Yeah, O.K.
Eliot Ness.
With reports from stakeouts and surveillances...
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Thank you.
What do you think?
I think there's nothing like vaudeville.
That's what I think.
Now, are you ready to go to work?
Where are we going?
On a liquor raid.
We need another man.
Hey, Ness, it's very interesting.
I've found a financial disbursement pattern here
which shows some irregu...
You carry a badge?
Yes.
Carry a gun.
Jimmy?
What?
What the hell are you dressed for, Halloween?
Shut up.
I'm working.
Where?
The circus.
Look.
They've got guns.
Well, here we are.
What are we doing here?
Liquor raid.
Here?
Mr. Ness, everybody knows where the booze is.
The problem isn't finding it.
It's who wants to cross Capone.
Let's go.
You'd better be damn sure, Malone.
If you walk through this door,
you're walking into a world of trouble.
No turning back, you understand?
Yes, I do.
Good.
Give me that ax.
Federal officers!
Get your hands up!
Nobody moves!
This is a raid!
What are you doing here?
All this stuff is impounded.
You're all under arrest.
Hey, this isn't right.
Hey, this is no good.
You got a warrant?
Sure. Here's my warrant.
How do you think he feels now,
better or worse?
What is that?
What is that?
Yes. What is it?
God, I'm with the heathen.
That is my call box key,
and that is St.Jude.
Santo Judaea.
He's the patron saint of lost causes.
And policemen.
Patron saint of policemen.
Mmm. Everybody needs a friend.
Lost causes, policemen.
Which do you want to be?
I want to be a cop.
You do?
Yeah.
Why?
To protect the property and citizenry...
Who... It's all... It's all right.
What?
Congratulations.
O.K. If I get a picture of you and your men?
Yeah. But not for publication, just for us.
Anything you say, Mr. Ness.
Closer in.
Arms straight.
O.K., ready? Hold it.
Life goes on.
A man becomes preeminent,
he's expected to have enthusiasms.
Enthusiasms.
Enthusiasms.
What are mine?
What draws my admiration?
What is that which gives me joy?
- Dames.
- Music.
Baseball.
A man...
A man stands alone at a plate.
This is the time for what?
For individual achievement.
There he stands alone.
But in the field, what?
Part of a team.
Teamwork.
Teamwork.
Looks, throws, catches, hustles...
Part of one big team.
Bats himself the livelong day.
Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and so on.
If his team don't field, what is he?
You follow me?
No one.
Sunny day, the stands are full of fans.
What does he have to say?
I'm going out there for myself.
But...
I get nowhere unless the team wins.
Team.
- Yeah, team.
- Team.
Jesus Christ!
Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
Amen.
God bless.
God bless Mommy. God bless Daddy.
God bless Dolly.
Amen.
Amen.
Good night.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night, little girl.
Can I have an Eskimo?
And butterfly.
Where are you going?
What?
Where are you going?
I thought I'd go downstairs.
Do some work for tomorrow.
You had a full day today, didn't you?
Yes, I certainly did.
You still got some energy left?
Oh, lot of work.
Well, why don't you come up and brush my hair,
you detective?
How are we doing?
Capone's organization is incredibly diverse.
Look at this.
It owns Canadian Holding Company Associations,
which owns in turn Green Light Laundry,
Midwest Cab, Jollytime Playthings...
Jollytime Playthings?
Yes, Jollytime Playthings.
Remind me to get a present for my daughter.
Bahamas Ship-to-Shore...
The list is endless.
All the business is legitimate.
Capone owns none of it.
We can get him on income tax evasion
if we can show that he's getting money
from the organization's business.
See, legally he receives no income.
He doesn't receive anything?
Mr. Ness, you have a visitor.
Mr. Ness, could we talk?
John O'Shea, alderman.
I know who you are.
Would you excuse us?
We have several large operations in the works.
What can I do for you?
I came up to congratulate you
on a job well done,
share your good fortune on such a lovely day.
What's that?
What is that?
Mr. Ness, you're an educated man.
Let me pay you the compliment of being blunt.
There is a large,
a large and popular business
which you are causing dismay.
Why don't you just cross the street
and let things take their course?
Would you come in here please?
In Roman times,
when a fella was convicted
of trying to bribe a public official,
they'd sew him in a bag with a wild animal
and throw that bag in the river.
You tell your master
that we must agree to disagree.
You're making a mistake.
I've made them before.
I'm beginning to enjoy them.
You're untouchable, is that it?
No one can get to you?
And you tell Capone...
Everyone can be gotten to.
I'll see him in hell.
Hey, nice house.
I said nice house.
You live there?
Little girl's having a birthday, huh?
Yes.
Nice to have a family.
Yes, it is.
A man should take care,
see that nothing happens to them.
Katherine!
Katherine!
Where's the baby?
She's upstairs. Eliot...
Ohh...
Daddy.
Ohh, yes.
What were you doing up?
I had to finish my ironing.
You did?
You're going to come with Daddy now, O.K.?
Eliot.
O.K., it's all right.
O.K., let's go.
Stay there!
Keep your eye on the street.
Where's Malone?
He's on the stakeout.
He'll be right here.
Who's he?
One of the men on his list. He's O.K.
All right, then.
Drive them to the station.
She'll tell you where to go when you're there.
Take off your hat.
Anything happens, you shoot first,
you understand me?
Yes, Mr. Ness.
Kiss.
Eskimo and butterfly, Dad.
O.K.
Now, go.
Malone.
Are you O.K.?
They're fine.
Are you sure the cop's O.K.?
He better be.
He's my cousin.
I want to hurt the man.
I want to start taking the battle to him.
Then merry Christmas because
we've got great news.
Tell him.
There's a huge international shipment
coming through.
We got the time, the place, the whole shebang.
Well, what are we doing standing here then?
How do you get this information?
That's the second rule of police work.
If you want to keep a secret,
don't tell the boss.
You know he's making over $3 million a year?
But he's paid no taxes.
Nothing's in his name.
If we can establish any payments to him,
we can prosecute him for income tax evasion.
What?
I said we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion.
Try a murderer for not paying his taxes?
Well, it's better than nothing.
All right. How do we link him to the money?
I don't know.
Go to sleep, Oscar.
A convoy of 5 to 10 trucks
filled with Canadian whiskey
will be met by someone from
the Capone organization.
He'll bring with him
full payment for the shipment in cash.
The meet is to occur just over the border,
on the American side.
Our aim is to confiscate the liquor and the cash.
Captain.
We will await their signal.
When they are on the road
and have given the signal,
we'll engage from the
Canadian side of the bridge,
thus surprising from the rear,
and surprise, Mr. Ness, is half the battle.
Yes, surprise is half the battle.
Many things are half the battle.
Let's think about what is all the battle.
Let's take the fight to them, gentlemen!
Thank you, Captain.
All right.
Move out.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
It'll all happen in time, hmm?
This is the job.
Don't wait for it to happen.
Don't even want it to happen.
Just watch what does happen.
Are you my tutor?
Yes, sir,
that I am.
Did you check it already?
Yes, I did.
Then leave it alone.
You're a good cop, Giuseppe.
You're doing good.
You're going to do just fine.
Now, Wallace, are you cold?
Mm.
Yes, I am a little.
Then stamp your feet.
It'll keep you warm.
You learn something 20 years walking a beat.
Snitches and...
standing in the rain.
Listen, Mr. Ness.
Mm-hmm?
I had an idea.
Shh. Shh.
You all have your spare shells, huh?
If you have to fire,
hold low and squeeze
and put your man down.
'Cause he'd do the same to you.
Shoot to kill.
You hear what I said?
Yes, I did.
Shoot to kill.
Let's go.
Easy.
The Canadians won't show
until I flash the badge.
It's imperative we cross
from here to the bridge quickly.
George, the count's right.
That doesn't concern me.
The size of these barrels concerns me.
Malone, we'll...
Stop.
Move it!
Move it, Georgie!
Nieden!
Charge!
What the hell. You've got to die of something.
Look!
It's the Mounties!
Let's get out of here!
The booze!
Let's go!
Behind you.
Cover us.
I can't believe it.
Here. The book.
Give me.
To the car.
Don't let those cars off the bridge!
Ha ha!
Whoo!
Stone, take the first car.
Tough guy.
Stone!
Go!
Stone!
I'm O.K.
You bas...
You all right?
Yeah.
There he is.
Go get him!
All right.
Enough of this running.
Well, Georgie boy.
Well, what have we got here?
Hello.
Huh?
Yaa!
Yaa!
Yaa!
Yaa!
Ah.
All right!
Drop the gun!
Put your hands in the air.
You're under arrest.
I said drop it!
Ah...
God, didn't you hear what I said?
What are you, deaf?
What is this, a game?
Hey.
Sit down.
Well, Stone's going to be all right.
I got the fella with the satchel.
I had to kill him.
Oh, yeah. He's as dead as Julius Caesar.
Would you rather it was you?
No, I would not.
Then you've done your duty.
Go home and sleep well tonight.
The things you see when
you're out without your gun.
You're a long way from the South Side, George.
I'm talking to you.
Did you come here to open a shooting gallery?
Write down the names of your
superiors and your contacts.
Why don't you kiss my ass?
Hey!
Eliot.
You've fired on federal officers.
Eliot.
You can be tough in Leavenworth for 30 years.
You're going inside for all day then.
Eliot.
What?
Look at this.
Look at this.
What is this?
What is this?
You got a lot of money
changing hands in this book.
What is this, ward?
Uh-huh.
Police precincts?
What? You got a heading here, "circuit court"?
You got a heading here, "circuit court"?
What is this?
Nothing.
It's nothing?
What is this?
If we establish that any of these entries
indicate payment to Capone,
we'll put Capone away.
Which entry is Capone's?
A-Costa. Is that Capone's code name?
You'll do it in the joint, unless you help us.
Translate this ledger.
In hell.
In hell? You're mucking with a G.
You'll hang higher than
Haman unless you cooperate.
This man can finger Capone.
He'll put Capone behind bars.
Fuck off.
I'm not fucking with you, Mr. Hardcase.
We'll get that information one way or another.
Not that way.
You'll beg to talk 'cause
somebody's going to talk.
That dirty son of a bitch!
Enough out of you.
Hey, come on, you, on your feet.
I need you to help translate this book.
I'm not going to ask you a second time.
I'm going to count to 3.
Oh, what's the matter?
Can't you talk with a gun in your mouth?
Aah!
I'm going to talk.
No! I'll tell you whatever you want.
What do you want to know?
And don't let him clean himself
till after he talks.
Now, ask him what you want to know.
All right, uh...
O.K. I want to know the name of the bookkeeper.
I want a complete translation of the code.
Mr. Ness!
I do not approve of your methods.
Yeah?
Well, you're not from Chicago.
What?
They got the shipment.
What?
They got the whole shipment.
I want him dead.
I don't care how.
We're trying...
Am I alone here?
Did I ask what you're trying to do?
I want you to get this fuck where he breathes.
I want find him.
I want him dead.
I want his family dead!
I want his house burnt to the ground!
I want to piss on his ashes!
Look at this guy.
This guy... he's so serious.
Well, he's got a lot on his mind.
He does?
Yes.
Like what?
Like what his name is.
Well... John.
I thought that was all settled.
It's John.
I suppose his middle name will be Law.
No.
It'll be Edgar.
It'll be J. Edgar.
I don't think so.
God, you're beautiful.
You should have seen us last night.
I know.
I should have been here.
I wanted to be.
I understand. I do.
Just tell me, are you being careful?
Careful as mice.
Are you making progress?
Progress?
Yes.
Mrs. Ness, I think your husband
just became the man who got Al Capone.
Gentlemen, a subpoena was issued
for Alphonse Capone by my office this morning
for the crime of evading
and conspiring to evade federal income tax.
What's the maximum Capone could get?
If convicted on all counts,
Mr. Capone could have up to 28 years.
Excuse me.
That's all.
Thank you.
O.K., here we go.
The car's in the alley.
You don't answer the phone.
We'll let it ring...
Twice.
From...
The corner.
Anybody knocks...
Come out shooting.
I got it.
You enjoy the tactical
aspects of law enforcement?
Yeah. It's much more diverting than accounting.
I been good to you.
You got to be good to me.
We made a deal.
We'll stick to it, O.K.?
Oh, yes. Much more diverting than accounting.
O.K. We see youse tonight.
Yeah. O.K.
All right.
All the way down. No stops.
When he sees error...
when he sees crime...
he can say I will speak up.
Before you go, I got one more question.
I must commend the excellent work
of Eliot Ness and his squad of untouchables.
What was it, boy or girl?
Boy.
Congratulations.
What's his name?
John.
John?
Yeah.
John James.
So she's O.K.?
Yeah, she's O.K.
She said she wants to repaint the whole house.
Then it will be too small.
You'll have to move.
Exactly.
Oh, goodness.
It's nice to be married.
If you can stand the pain.
Mr. Burns, where's Mr. Wallace?
Didn't you see them?
They just went down the service elevator.
Very good.
Keep an eye out, you hear?
I'm telling you they're going to send someone.
Did he say the service elevator?
Yes.
Wallace?
Wallace!
Let's take the stairs.
Oh.
No.
No.
Easy.
Easy!
Oscar.
Lord Jesus.
You going to be all right?
Mr. Ness.
Ah.
It's always a crime
when a young guy goes down on the lines.
I'd hate to see it happen to someone I know.
Sometimes it's better not to get involved.
Jimmy.
Take a day off.
Leave the city for a while.
You know what I mean?
Al Capone.
We have no Mr. ...
Get him.
We have no...
I said, goddamn it,
I said...
Something you want here?
My friend was killed today.
I don't care.
You don't care.
Now he does.
Come on, Capone.
You want to fight?
You and me, right here.
That's it. Come on!
What's the matter, you afraid
to stand up for yourself?
You want it now?
Let's go.
You son of a bitch.
What?
You talk to me like that
in front of my son? Fuck you!
Eliot! It's me.
It's me.
Not this way.
Not this way.
You fuck. You got nothing.
A lot of talk and a badge.
You hear?
You got nothing.
Nothing in court, no bookkeeper.
You got nothing!
Nothing!
If you were a man, you'd have done it.
You punk!
No, I...
No, I understand.
Believe me... I understand.
Well, what's happened?
He says he can't be unprotected.
What is it that the guy says?
He says he won't make a fool out of himself.
He won't go into court without a witness.
Tomorrow the D.A.'s going to announce
that he's dropping the case.
He's going to give up?
I didn't say that.
He's got no witness.
We have Wallace's files...
There's a time when you have to cut your losses.
Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
No, he... he didn't have a family.
How is everything there?
N-no, y-no, you do it however you want.
I... I promise I will.
You give her my love.
I love you, too.
Mr. Ness,
we got a ledger here
listing payments to Chicago city officials.
There's Al Capone, Frank Nitti...
I think that's enough for today.
I know, but...
That will do.
Thank you.
I'd like to request to stick around.
We got to bust these guys.
I know.
Is that it?
I'm sorry?
You heard me.
My question is,
are we done?
Yes, I think we're done.
You're saying we sat in at a game
that was above our heads.
It appears so.
Mr. Wallace would agree.
He's dead!
And the D.A.'s dropping the case.
He won't go into court without a witness
nor without Capone's bookkeeper Walter Payne.
What will you do now?
What would you have me do?
I've taken this as far as it can go.
What did your wife want?
She wanted to know if I was...
My wife?
Yeah.
Uh, she wanted to know if I was all right.
It's nice being married, eh?
Yes.
She's sitting in some room
surrounded by people she doesn't know
going over...
kitchen color charts or something.
Some part of the world...
still cares what color the kitchen is.
Eliot.
Do one more thing for me.
Get back to the D.A.
And stall him.
Wait a minute.
Stall him with what?
Just do as I say.
I think I know how to find this guy.
Walter.
Al says we're leaving town
until he can fix this subpoena thing.
We're leaving tonight.
Mike, you got a minute?
Well, I do now, don't I?
What are you doing in the club for cops?
This is a place for cops.
Can we step outside?
All right. All right.
But I got nothing to say to you.
Where the hell are we going, for a swim?
Get out of the rain, fool.
What?
What?
I just need one more piece of information.
One more?
I need...
Jimmy, I just risked my life for you.
I need to find that bookkeeper.
Are you crazy?
You're crazy.
I warned you to leave town.
If they knew it was me, I'm dead.
I need to find that bookkeeper.
You're fucking out of your mind.
You're out of it!
And I tried to save your life.
Get your hands off.
You owe me, Jimmy.
I don't owe you nothing.
My people are being killed.
We're your people!
You're my people?
You run with the dagos.
He's ruined this town.
For 10 years I can't eat my food
with the shit that's going on.
Now say I'm a cop.
Oh, bullshit!
Fucking bullshit!
Look at yourself.
Look at yourself.
Ah, go on and live the charade...
with your soft clothes and federal stooges.
What the hell do you think he's going to do?
Clean up this town?
Where is this guy?
I need to know now,
or I'll rat you out for all
the shit that you've done.
I'm going to turn you over.
This is a dead man talking to me.
Is it?
You're dead.
Who do you think you are?
You'll hang from the flagpole.
Let's cut the wolfing.
Tell me, or you're going
to the hospital or the morgue.
You fight this thing,
and we'll have a case.
Yes, but on what basis?
I'm not going to make a fool...
Don't tell me about being foolish.
I have men risking something more than that.
We're following a lead
at risk to more than our standing.
So don't dare stop now.
Yeah, Stone.
Ness.
He's at the D.A.'s.
Tell him I know where Payne is
and to meet me at my place.
Al!
Hey, Al!
Al!
Say, what about that court date?
I'm going to tell you something.
Somebody messes with me,
I'm going to mess with him.
Somebody steals from me,
I'm going to say you stole,
not talk to him for spitting on the sidewalk.
not talk to him for spitting on the sidewalk.
You understand?
Now, I have done nothing to hurt these people,
but they're angered at me,
so what do they do?
Doctor up some income tax,
for which they got no case, to annoy me.
To speak to me like men? No.
To harass a peaceful man.
I pray to God that if I had a grievance,
I would have a little more self-respect.
Mr. Capone, just one more question.
One more thing...
You wait till a prize fight is over.
One guy's left standing.
That's how you know who won.
Huh.
Isn't that just like a wop?
Brings a knife to a gunfight.
Get out of here, you dago bastard!
Go on!
Get your ass out of here!
Shots.
All right.
Stay back.
Everybody stay back.
Take the back.
Malone!
Malone.
Goddamn! Stone!
- Stone!
- Ah!
Call!
Oh, God.
Call an ambulance!
Stone, Treasury Department.
I need an ambulance.
What?
What, this?
You want this?
You want this?
You want this?
The bookkeeper.
The what?
Book...
The bookkeeper?
Bookkeeper.
Bookkeeper?
What?
The bookkeeper, he's on this train?
Yes.
He's on this train?
What... What are you prepared to do?
Don't... Don't die.
Stay.
Stay.
Stay.
Aw, no.
No, no!
Not this man.
Not this man.
The train's leaving for Miami 12:05, Mr. Ness.
We'll be there.
The bookkeeper's no good to us dead.
Stone?
Yes, sir.
Cover the south entrance.
We're almost home.
We're almost home.
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh.
Your attention, please.
Miami, Florida, departing 12:05, track33.
All aboard.
Shh.
Stay right there, O.K.?
Just stay right there.
Shh. Stay right there.
Stay right there, honey.
Shh.
Aw, Angel.
Your attention, please.
Miami, Florida, leaving at 12:05,
now boarding on track33.
All aboard.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Shh.
I know.
We're almost home.
May I have your attention, please?
Miami, Florida, leaving at 12:05,
is now boarding on track33.
All aboard.
Oh, one more.
Here we go.
Mama's going to pull.
You ready?
I'm right here, honey.
Here we go.
There.
Your attention, please.
May I have your attention, please?
This is the final call for Miami, Florida,
leaving at 12:05 from track33.
All aboard.
Here we go.
Here. Let me help.
Thank you so much.
Get your bags.
Thank you, sir.
Are you all right?
Thank you.
You're such a gentleman.
It's kind of you to help me.
I really wasn't sure if we'd make it or not.
Is there some problem I can help you with?
No.
No.
I really can't thank you enough.
Isn't this fun?
Oh, you're being such a good boy, sweetheart.
Thank you again.
This is so wonderful.
Oh, thank you, sir.
I'll take him from here.
You've been a great help.
Thank you so much.
Almost there.
I'll take it from here.
Thank you very much for your help.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, don't cry, sweetheart.
We're almost home.
Is something wrong?
Sir?
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
What are you doing?
Shut up!
I said shut up!
- What are you doing?
- Shut the fuck up!
Hold it!
Hold it.
My baby!
Stay there.
He's O.K.
Shut up!
I said hold it!
What the...
See, I'm walking out with the bookkeeper.
And the bookkeeper and me are driving away.
Or else he dies.
He dies.
And you ain't got nothing.
You got five seconds to make up your mind.
I'll tell you what you want to know.
Shut up!
I'm not kidding, Ness!
I'll tell you what you want to know!
You got him?
Yeah, I got him.
Will you stop it?
Take him.
The two coded entries in this ledger
represent cash disbursement
to all levels of city officials,
members of the police,
and to Alphonse Capone.
That's correct.
Excuse me?
I said that is correct.
And you will decipher these coded entries for us.
I will.
Sorry, Mr. Payne.
I can't hear you.
I said I will.
You were in charge of disbursements
for Mr. Capone?
Yes, I was.
And you personally distributed monies...
vast, undeclared monies...
to Mr. Capone?
Yes, I did.
Would you tell us the amounts?
In a three-year period,
I personally disbursed monies to Mr. Capone
in excess of $1.3 million.
Would you repeat that amount, please?
$1.3 million.
Thank you very much.
I don't understand it.
What does Capone have?
We're nailing the lid
on his coffin, and he's smiling.
He's wearing a gun in court.
Get me the bailiff.
It'll be a fast trial.
The man in the front row wearing the white suit
is carrying a gun.
I don't want this to turn into something.
When you get him up, I'll lead you out.
Could we speak to you a minute, please?
Get up against it.
Who the hell are you?
You heard him.
Up against it.
What's this?
Empty all your pockets.
On the table. All of it.
I got a permit for that.
Fine. Let's see it.
You know, I'm not the one under indictment.
Everything on the table.
Give him his gun back.
"To whom it may concern...
"Please extend to the bearer, Mr. Frank Nitti,
"all possible courtesy and consideration.
William Thompson, mayor of the city of Chicago."
I'm sorry, Mr. Ness.
You'll have to give it back.
Fine.
But that man does not go
back into that courtroom.
Do you understand me?
Yes, sir.
You know, I used to have
a friend who lived there.
Don't.
Let him go.
No!
Here. Take it.
Aah!
Here I am, Treasury man.
Come on.
Arrest me.
What are you waiting for?
Don't just stand there.
Arrest me.
Don't push me.
They're going to burn you.
Yeah?
I'll come see you burn, you son of a bitch,
'cause you killed my friend.
He died like a pig.
What did you say?
I said your friend died screaming
like a stuck Irish pig.
You think about that when I beat the rap.
Hey.
Aah!
Aah!
Did he sound anything like that?
One picture.
Come on. One picture.
Mr. Ness, take a look at this.
Mr. Ness.
Mr. Ness, you doing O.K.?
I think you better see this.
What is it?
What is it? That's a jury list, Mr. Ness.
They've been bribed.
Got it out of Nitti's coat.
Where is Nitti?
He's in the car.
This constitutes no evidence.
It has no providence.
Your Honor, the truth of the case
is that Capone is a killer and will go free.
The only way to deal with such men
is hunt them down.
I have forsworn myself.
I have broken every law I swore to defend.
I'm content I've done right.
That man must be stopped, and you must...
I'll be the judge
of what I must do, Mr. Ness.
Would you excuse us?
Bailiff.
Yes, sir?
Bailiff, go next door to Judge Hoffman's court.
They've just begun hearing a divorce action.
I want you to bring that jury in here
and take this jury to his court.
Bailiff, are those instructions clear?
Yes, sir.
They're clear.
Bailiff, I want you to switch the juries.
Your Honor, I object.
Overruled.
What did you tell him?
I told him his name was in the ledger, too.
His name wasn't in the ledger.
Wait. What is this?
Is this the law?
You're out of order.
I think that we...
I don't care what you think.
What do I look like?
Do something.
Order!
Your Honor,
we'd like to withdraw our plea of not guilty
and enter a plea of guilty.
Guilty?
Order in the court!
Order!
Guilty?
I'll give you guilty.
Bailiff!
Bailiff, clear the courtroom!
Your Honor. Your Honor, is that justice?
Why did he switch the jury?
Are you going to continue
going after the organization?
Excuse me.
I'm asking Your Honor, is this justice?
What about justice?
Is this justice?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Never stop. Never stop fighting
till the fight is done.
What did you say?
Never stop fighting till the fight is done.
What?
You heard me, Capone.
You're nothing but talk and a badge.
Here endeth the lesson.
You're nothing but a lot of talk and a badge!
You're nothing but a lot of talk and a badge!
So much violence.
Cleaning up a little.
I guess it's goodbye.
Goodbye, George.
I want to, uh, thank you for this.
No. Thank you.
Mr. Ness...
I think he wanted you to have that.
He'd have wanted a cop to have it.
I'm going home.
Mr. Ness, any comment for the record?
The man who put Al Capone on the spot.
I happened to be there when the wheel went round.
They say they're going to repeal prohibition.
What will you do then?
I think I'll have a drink.
