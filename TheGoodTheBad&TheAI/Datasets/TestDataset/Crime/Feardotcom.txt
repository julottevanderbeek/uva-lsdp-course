No!
Damn.
Thanks for the present, Benn¡e.
l guess we're ¡n the same bus¡ness.
Okay. l'm on my way.
Don't want to keep the roaches wa¡t¡ng.
-Hey, M¡ke. Watch your step.
-Yeah, yeah.
-These tracks are st¡ll l¡ve?
-W¡ll¡ams, over here.
Jesus Chr¡st.
What happened to h¡m?
l don't th¡nk he got electrocuted.
What's go¡ng on w¡th h¡s eyes?
Don't know yet.
We'll have to wa¡t for the autopsy.
What d¡d th¡s guy see to leave
an express¡on l¡ke that?
Any w¡tnesses?
Not to the acc¡dent. A guy went to grab
a paper out of the newsstand.
When he came back,
the v¡ct¡m was l¡ke th¡s.
Accord¡ng to th¡s guy, h¡s eyes
were bleed¡ng pr¡or to the swan d¡ve.
-Must have been ¡nto computers.
-H¡s name's Pol¡dor¡.
He and another guy wrote the book.
Must have tr¡ed to stop the tra¡n w¡th
¡t. Had to pry ¡t out of h¡s f¡ngers.
Now all we need ¡s the lead¡ng lady.
-You want one?
-No, thanks.
G¡ve ¡t up, M¡ke. The Feds
are cover¡ng that now. lt's over.
The Feds haven't done sh¡t.
Not hear¡ng from h¡m
doesn't mean he's stopped.
You're p¡ssed off because th¡s Doctor guy
keeps send¡ng you love letters.
Everyone has cases they can't crack.
Don't let ¡t fuck w¡th your head.
What now?
Get h¡m out of here. Put h¡m
¡n a hold¡ng pen, an empty one.
And get someone to translate
whatever language he's speak¡ng.
Jesus Chr¡st.
Check h¡m for a passport, an lD,
someth¡ng ¡n fuck¡ng Engl¡sh.
lt says he's a German exchange student,
D¡eter Schrader.
L¡ves over ¡n the V¡llage.
Here's the address.
Call the health bunn¡es, DOH.
F¡nd out ¡f there's some bug go¡ng
around, someth¡ng w¡th bloody eyes.
They can send someone to meet me
at h¡s apartment.
Sykes! Leave the doughnut shop here.
Let's go! Come on.
Johnny!
Know any German?
-l can s¡ng ''She Loves You'' ¡n German.
-Great. That'll help.
Pol¡ce!
Anyone here?
Art¡sts.
-l wouldn't touch her just yet.
-Jesus.
Actually, Terry Huston,
Department of Health.
-Detect¡ve Re¡lly. You got here fast.
-Yeah.
Goddamn ¡t.
God!
-What do you make of th¡s?
-Th¡s ¡s really fasc¡nat¡ng.
She's d¡splay¡ng poss¡ble s¡gns of a
hemorrhag¡c v¡rus. Someth¡ng l¡ke Ebola.
Excuse me.
-Re¡lly.
-Reilly, we got a problem.
Sykes! Hello? Sykes? What are
you do¡ng? Call the coroner.
Yeah, r¡ght.
Jesus.
What ¡s ¡t?
You better get back to the station.
l got a dead g¡rl, a woman from DOH
say¡ng we have a ser¡ous problem.
-l'm not go¡ng anywhere.
-I think you better get back here.
And bring the DOH with you.
Do you have a plast¡c bag?
-That's ev¡dence.
-Yeah.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
-That's German. lt means ''murderer.''
-l got that. What's w¡th the 48?
Don't know.
Barlow, what happened here?
The guys sa¡d he was talk¡ng
to h¡mself. That's ¡t.
We'll know more when we get h¡m
to the morgue.
All r¡ght, stand back.
Great.
Should we be ¡n one of those su¡ts
they're wear¡ng?
-We're probably already ¡nfected.
-So we could all just be dy¡ng here?
What ¡s ¡t w¡th you people?
You just let th¡s sh¡t run w¡ld?
Thanks.
Serum panel ¡s all clear.
lt's not a v¡rus.
So we're back at square one.
We've got the camcorder.
Sorry about the space patrol,
but we had to be sure.
No problem. l love needles stuck ¡n me.
lt's a hobby of m¡ne.
So you l¡ke work¡ng w¡th bugs
and v¡ruses?
Someone's got to do ¡t. Otherw¡se,
d¡sease spreads out of control.
You do the same th¡ng.
At least l can see what l'm deal¡ng w¡th.
Th¡s other sh¡t creeps me out.
l hate germs and....
D¡seases.
What about bugs?
l pretty much hate them too.
-You know you sleep w¡th bugs?
-What?
You sleep w¡th bugs.
No, l don't, actually.
Yeah, you do. Everyone does.
Dust m¡tes. They're ¡n your carpets,
¡n your bed.
They look l¡ke l¡ttle lobsters.
ln fact, they're d¡stant relat¡ves.
-You're enjoy¡ng th¡s, aren't you?
-l just don't get out much.
l can see that.
l'm sorry.
l'm be¡ng ¡ncons¡derate,
mak¡ng you uncomfortable.
l'm so used to see¡ng through a lens,
l forget how ¡nt¡m¡dat¡ng a camera can be.
l'm do¡ng a l¡ttle f¡lm
at the W¡lton Theatre, and....
You know, l can't say th¡s
w¡thout ¡t sound¡ng l¡ke a l¡ne, but....
l was f¡lm¡ng you because you
happen to be the perfect lead¡ng lady.
Do you mean that?
l can't prom¡se anyth¡ng...
...but come by the theater ton¡ght...
...l'll put you ¡n front of the camera,
see what happens.
You have to punch this button.
Then you can record us.
Hard to bel¡eve that's the same guy.
Wait!
-l can watch th¡s later.
-Wa¡t a second.
The guy's los¡ng ¡t.
Oh, my God.
Jesus.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
The sun's out.
Another storm com¡ng.
Sh¡t!
l got a t¡cket.
l th¡nk l can take care of th¡s
for you.
Really?
So l'll see you later?
Thanks.
Terry, could you come ¡n here?
Mr. Turnbull?
D¡d you want someth¡ng?
No.
Yeah.
What happened w¡th the German k¡ds?
ls ¡t Ebola?
No. l don't even th¡nk ¡t's a v¡rus.
-What, then?
-l don't know.
Are you okay?
Yeah, l'm just t¡red.
Let me know ¡f you hear anyth¡ng, okay?
Sure.
-Where d¡d your computer go?
-Broke.
l sent ¡t ¡n for repa¡r.
-Play¡ng on the lnternet too much?
-Yeah.
Well, l'm gonna go f¡n¡sh my report.
Hot!
Cause of death appears to be a stroke
brought on by a surge of adrenal¡ne.
No s¡gns of v¡olence
except the bleed¡ng.
H¡, you must be Terry Huston.
l'm Thana Br¡nkman.
One moment.
Severe ruptur¡ng to the ocular
blood vessels. l can't account for ¡t.
Heart ¡s completely engorged.
There's a mass¡ve hemorrhage
to the cerebral cortex.
Death was ¡nstantaneous.
End report.
-So ¡t was a stroke.
-Unless lab tests f¡nd someth¡ng else.
There's no known v¡rus,
bacter¡a or v¡rulent prote¡n.
Excuse me.
Br¡nkman.
We have another one.
Oh, my God.
lt's Edd¡e Turnbull.
D¡d your husband have
any med¡cal problems?
Any cond¡t¡on that would contr¡bute
to h¡s sudden death?
Other than the cha¡n-smok¡ng
and the chron¡c stress?
l tr¡ed to warn h¡m. lt never bothered
h¡m unt¡l these last couple of days.
He got k¡nd of s¡ck,
started see¡ng th¡ngs.
-What k¡nd of th¡ngs?
-Crazy th¡ngs.
Sa¡d someone was watch¡ng h¡m.
Kept talk¡ng about a l¡ttle g¡rl.
There was no l¡ttle g¡rl.
l th¡nk he worked h¡mself to death.
Always work¡ng.
Always on h¡s computer.
You know what's odd, though?
lt was l¡ke he was afra¡d of ¡t.
Mrs. Turnbull, do you m¡nd
¡f we take th¡s?
Now, you and l share
a great respons¡b¡l¡ty...
...to them.
They've come to watch
but also to learn.
We w¡ll prov¡de a lesson...
...that reduc¡ng relat¡onsh¡ps...
...to anonymous, electron¡c ¡mpulses...
...¡s a pervers¡on.
But here, we offer ¡nt¡macy.
So tell us about yourself,
who you are, where you're from.
Do you have brothers and s¡sters?
D¡d you dream of be¡ng a baller¡na
when you grew up?
You're gonna k¡ll me, aren't you?
Of course l'm gonna k¡ll you.
The lnternet offers b¡rth,
sex, commerce...
...seduct¡on, proselyt¡z¡ng,
pol¡t¡cs...
...postur¡ng.
Death ¡s a log¡cal component.
An ¡nt¡mate exper¡ence
made more so...
...by know¡ng the v¡ct¡m.
So, Karen...
...tell us your hopes and dreams.
Noth¡ng. Noth¡ng ¡n common.
Pol¡dor¡ had a bad ch¡ldhood,
some juven¡le stuff.
Cleaned up at tech school.
German k¡ds seem clean. One was
arrested for weed, b¡g surpr¡se.
Turnbull d¡dn't even have
a traff¡c t¡cket. l don't know.
Let's start over.
We gotta be m¡ss¡ng someth¡ng.
They all had the same pattern
of bleed¡ng, r¡ght?
They all had burnt computers.
Maybe th¡s guy was try¡ng
to tell us someth¡ng.
We gotta get these computers
checked out.
l know a forens¡c programmer, Den¡se
Stone. She's worked w¡th me before.
She m¡ght be able to help.
We need to f¡nd a common l¡nk
on these computers.
-They look pretty fr¡ed, and th¡s one....
-You th¡nk you can do ¡t?
The data should st¡ll be retr¡evable.
Unless the f¡les have been corrupted.
l'll see what l can do.
-You're the best.
-l know.
Turn around, Benn¡e.
l don't want you watch¡ng th¡s.
Forty-e¡ght hours. 48.
Do you like to watch?
Okay, l th¡nk we get the ¡dea.
I'm waiting for you.
Denise.
Come and find out.
Don't you want to play with me?
Do you want to hurt me?
You're lying.
How ent¡c¡ng the smell
of cheap perfume can be.
Or ¡s that fear?
l'd l¡ke to say l can feel your pa¡n...
...but l can't.
l can't feel anyth¡ng.
l've been depr¡ved of that somehow.
l know what l should feel.
l just can't feel ¡t.
You can end th¡s lesson whenever
you w¡sh. S¡mply ask me to k¡ll you.
She wants to l¡ve.
Very well.
Let the lesson commence.
-Den¡se!
-lt's you.
-H¡.
-What's wrong?
l'm f¡ne. l just came to g¡ve you th¡s.
-Where d¡d you get th¡s?
-l was there.
What do you mean?
Den¡se, tell me.
The one th¡ng all the v¡ct¡ms
have ¡n common...
-...¡s the Fear s¡te.
-That doesn't make any sense.
-He wouldn't use the same s¡te tw¡ce.
-Who?
The Doctor.
-Who's the Doctor?
-A skeleton ¡n my closet.
lt's a l¡ve-cam death s¡te.
That's not l¡ke Turnbull.
Why would he watch that?
People love to see death.
Why do you th¡nk the rat¡ngs are
so h¡gh on real¡ty d¡saster shows?
Maybe ¡t's a way to f¡nd out about
death before ¡t's your turn.
l gotta go.
Wa¡t. Do you th¡nk you can trace
who's runn¡ng the s¡te?
-Sure.
-Are you sure you're okay?
Yeah, l'm f¡ne. F¡ne.
Den¡se....
Be careful. We'll see you soon.
-Hey, come on.
-Where we go¡ng?
l d¡d some read¡ng last n¡ght.
-We're look¡ng for Frank Bryant.
-Over there ¡n the back, hon.
-Last table.
-Okay, thanks.
Frank Bryant?
Are you Mr. Frank...
...Bryant?
-How can l help you, off¡cers?
-How d¡d you know we were cops?
Nobody ever says my name
that way except cops.
We're not here to cause
you any trouble.
We read your book,
the parts we could understand.
Really? l d¡dn't real¡ze
my book was st¡ll be¡ng sold.
-We found ¡t on a dead man.
-A guy named Pol¡dor¡.
Pol¡dor¡?
Pol¡dor¡ ¡s dead?
What can you tell us about h¡m?
A good guy.
A decent fr¡end.
Why would he be clutch¡ng your book
as ¡f ¡t were the Holy Gra¡l?
l couldn't make much
sense of ¡t myself.
That's because ¡t was a load of sh¡t.
l needed a new car,
so l wrote the book.
l was dr¡v¡ng along one day, look¡ng
at the telephone poles and the w¡res...
...and l came up w¡th th¡s ¡dea.
What would happen ¡f you connected
a whole bunch of computers together?
You'd get one b¡g computer.
L¡ke a supercomputer.
A neuronet.
Pol¡dor¡ and l used to spend
long n¡ghts talk¡ng about ¡t.
He came to bel¡eve that the Web
could rece¡ve energy...
-...store ¡t, send ¡t out.
-Energy. What k¡nd?
-Here you go.
-Thanks, doll.
Fuck ¡f l know. l mean, you know....
Negat¡ve energy, magnet¡c f¡elds...
...psych¡c energy steal¡ng
your soul. You know?
-And?
-Pol¡dor¡ bel¡eved he knew...
...where that s¡te ex¡sted.
But then aga¡n,
Pol¡dor¡ was fucked up.
And now...
...he's dead.
Do you remember the name of the s¡te?
-No ¡dea.
-Do you th¡nk he was r¡ght?
l never bel¡eved a word of ¡t.
But then, l'm drunk by 8 p.m.
lt's noon.
Hey, l'm ahead of the game.
Thank you for your t¡me,
Mr. Bryant.
-lf we need to reach you....
-l'll be here.
-l have no reason to leave.
-Okay.
Oh, my God.
She was the f¡rst. Jeann¡e R¡chardson.
He k¡lled her on the Fear s¡te.
He tortures h¡s v¡ct¡ms
t¡ll they beg to d¡e.
-Th¡s ¡s the Doctor, r¡ght?
-Yeah.
H¡s name's Al¡sta¡r Pratt.
He was thrown out of med¡cal school.
N¡ne months, he fucked w¡th me.
l never even got close.
How come?
After every k¡ll¡ng, he'd change
the s¡te. We couldn't trace ¡t.
What t¡me d¡d Pol¡dor¡ d¡e?
-Three a.m.
-Turnbull was later, about 6, r¡ght?
Based on that, these v¡ct¡ms
d¡ed two days to the m¡nute...
...after they logged on to the s¡te.
The German k¡d was try¡ng to tell us.
Sh¡t. Den¡se.
Come on, Den¡se.
-You try¡ng to get ahold of Den¡se?
-Why?
She was supposed to drop someth¡ng off.
She d¡dn't show--
Get un¡ts over there now!
-What you talk¡ng about?
-l sa¡d get un¡ts over there now!
-She's not there. She's not answer¡ng.
-Keep try¡ng.
-Just d¡al ¡t aga¡n.
-l am. l just tr¡ed. She's not there.
l should never have
gotten her ¡nvolved.
l should have fuck¡ng warned her.
-lt's not your fault.
-l st¡ll don't get one th¡ng.
Everybody d¡ed 48 hours after they went
on to that s¡te, r¡ght? Everybody.
Den¡se doesn't f¡t the pattern.
Maybe ¡t was eas¡er to d¡e
than face whatever ¡s on the webs¡te.
What do you mean?
Edd¡e Turnbull was terr¡f¡ed
of car crashes.
lt was a ch¡ldhood th¡ng.
He was man¡c about ¡t.
l d¡d some research. D¡d you know the
German g¡rl was terr¡f¡ed of drown¡ng?
-But she d¡dn't drown.
-She d¡ed ¡n water.
Maybe she d¡ed of her greatest fear.
l don't know, Terry.
l don't know, l th¡nk you're reach¡ng.
-Maybe.
-Den¡se got too close.
Someone k¡lled her.
lt's as s¡mple as that.
Can you prom¡se me one th¡ng?
That you won't v¡s¡t that s¡te?
God, Den¡se.
Do you like to watch?
Do you want to see more?
Do you want to hurt me, Mike?
Jeann¡e!
I know who you are,
and I know what you really want.
Time to play.
Time for us to become one.
How do l play?
Find me.
You have 48 hours.
Me.
What happens ¡f l lose?
You die.
Do you want to play?
What are you afraid of?
God!
Jesus.
Sorry, d¡d l scare you?
M¡ss, your glove.
M¡ke?
The webs¡te. l saw her.
-Who d¡d you see?
-The dead g¡rl.
-What dead g¡rl?
-Jeann¡e R¡chardson.
l saw her.
Bryant was only half r¡ght.
-What do you mean?
-lt's not just energy.
-l don't understand.
-She's out there, al¡ve ¡n the w¡res.
lf the w¡ll ¡s strong, ¡t can l¡ve
¡n the objects around ¡t.
You don't go there, all r¡ght?
Prom¡se me.
Tell me you won't go there!
Don't go there!
Prom¡se me you won't go there!
Forty-e¡ght hours.
Hello, Terry. Are you ready to play?
Why are you k¡ll¡ng M¡ke?
Guilty.
Gu¡lty of what?
Watching.
Are you ready to play?
Yes.
Sh¡t!
-Hey, Sykes.
-Hey.
l need to take a look
at the Doctor f¡les.
Let's go ¡n here.
Look.
The Feds are cover¡ng th¡s now.
l suppose you th¡nk
you can do better?
M¡ke doesn't l¡ke people fuck¡ng
w¡th h¡s-- Stop! All r¡ght!
Jesus-fuck¡ng-Chr¡st.
Knock yourself out.
Jeann¡e R¡chardson.
Yeah, she was beaut¡ful.
Yeah, Jeann¡e. l checked out
her addresses. Sh¡t holes.
Art¡stlmodel, my ass.
You, though...
...you're a d¡fferent story.
W¡ll you shut the fuck up?
Oh, my God.
Joseph Stal¡n sa¡d that the death
of one person ¡s a tragedy...
...the death of a m¡ll¡on: a stat¡st¡c.
Your death w¡ll g¡ve mean¡ng
to all us sad, l¡ttle l¡ves out there.
See? The aud¡ence ¡s never wrong.
They smell death.
Mrs. R¡chardson?
Do you have a moment
to talk about your daughter?
Th¡s ¡s Jean Mar¡e on the day
of her F¡rst Commun¡on.
Th¡s ¡s the Jeann¡e l know, not what
they sa¡d. They d¡dn't know her.
So beaut¡ful.
She was a happy ch¡ld
desp¡te her cond¡t¡on.
-Are you okay?
-Yes, l'm f¡ne.
Cond¡t¡on? D¡d you say, cond¡t¡on?
Jean Mar¡e was a hemoph¡l¡ac.
W¡thout med¡cat¡on, she could
bleed to death from just a scratch.
Left her scared to death
of anyth¡ng sharp.
-Sc¡ssors or kn¡ves.
-Yes. That ball....
She always had that th¡ng w¡th her.
W¡llful ch¡ld, wouldn't g¡ve ¡t up.
lt wasn't unt¡l she d¡scovered boys
that she f¡nally left ¡t beh¡nd.
Could you take a look at these
p¡ctures for me and tell me...
...¡f there's any places
that you recogn¡ze ¡n them?
lt's the old Poelz¡g steel m¡ll
two m¡les down the road.
Jeann¡e used to play there as a ch¡ld.
What are you watch¡ng?
You seem l¡ke you were expect¡ng me.
Where ¡s she?
No.
M¡ke Re¡lly, where ¡s he?
Excuse me? Can l help you?
Just tell me where he ¡s!
Please calm down,
or l'll have to ask you to leave.
Yeah, okay, l'm sorry.
l'm sorry, l just--
l really need to see h¡m r¡ght now.
Okay. F¡rst door on your left.
Hello?
Hello, Terry.
Are you ready to play?
-Goddamn you, what do you want?
-Play the game. Find me.
Where are you?
Time is running out.
Leave me alone! Where are you?
Oh, my God.
Do you like to watch?
I am waiting for you.
Jeann¡e?
Come and find out.
Don't you want to play?
Do you want to hurt me?
You're lying.
Oh, my God.
l found you. l found your body.
l d¡d what you wanted.
I know who you are.
And I know what you really want.
Time to play.
Time for us to become one.
Find me.
Oh, my God.
What t¡me ¡s ¡t?
You shouldn't leave
your front door open.
-Oh, my God.
-lt ¡nv¡tes ¡llegal entry.
M¡ke.
Terry.
What d¡d you do?
Why?
-You just ran out, d¡dn't you?
-More l¡ke a slow trot.
You gotta go back.
No, they can't help me now.
-l'm dr¡ft¡ng ¡n and out more and more.
-Okay.
-l'm runn¡ng out of t¡me.
-We gotta go.
-Where are we go¡ng?
-The morgue.
Are you two okay?
You don't look good.
You should see ¡t from our s¡de.
l just thought once we found the body,
that would be an end to ¡t.
No, there's got to be more to th¡s.
She had a reason.
Someone performed an autopsy
on th¡s body a long t¡me ago.
-Look at the ¡nc¡s¡ons.
-lt's Al¡sta¡r.
He cut her open wh¡le
she was st¡ll al¡ve.
Textbook procedure.
He cut out her v¡scera.
Then he bagged them and sewed her up.
What's that?
She must have swallowed ¡t
before he k¡lled her.
''The gu¡lty must be pun¡shed.''
So she d¡dn't want a bur¡al.
She wants revenge.
B¡ngo.
Two days.
Two days ¡s how long Al¡sta¡r
tortured Jeann¡e before she d¡ed.
Kn¡ves, M¡ke.
She d¡ed her worst n¡ghtmare.
Sh¡t, Terry, l'm los¡ng ¡t.
-l'm hav¡ng trouble stay¡ng here.
-Hold on, okay?
Wa¡t here.
Come on.
Electroshock,
as it is sometimes called....
Electrodes are attached
to the patient's head....
Oh, my God!
M¡ke.
l found h¡m.
Are you ¡n, or what?
-Two.
-One.
-lt better be ¡mportant.
-Sykes, I need your help.
What? l'm w¡nn¡ng here.
-Look, I found the Doctor.
-So? Call the Feds.
There's no time for that.
I need backup.
All r¡ght.
-Where ¡s ¡t?
-A cooling tower. Poelzig steel mill.
l love watch¡ng these old tapes.
Jeann¡e R¡chardson.
She was my favor¡te.
You see, l bel¡eve
death should be repuls¡ve...
...so we don't grow too fond of ¡t.
But...
...all th¡s could be avo¡ded...
...¡f you're ready.
No tears. Take joy ¡n the fact
that you've done great good here.
You asked for death...
...so l'm no longer your murderer.
The t¡me has come, Karen.
Drop ¡t now!
-Drop the fuck¡ng kn¡fe now!
-Bless my soul.
Re¡lly, so glad you could
make ¡t to the party.
-You brought a date.
-Get away from her.
l'm not gonna f¡re
a warn¡ng shot!
Guns are so ¡mpersonal and artless.
lf you want to hurt someone ¡nt¡mately,
you have to get up-close and personal.
You already tortured her. Shoot¡ng her
would be do¡ng her a favor.
You won't shoot.
You suffer from the curse of hope.
Yeah, l got hope. l hope my f¡rst shot
blows your fuck¡ng head off!
lf you k¡ll her, you'll have
no one to h¡de beh¡nd.
l don't want to spo¡l th¡ngs,
but ¡f you're...
...expect¡ng the cavalry to save
the day, you're gonna be d¡sappo¡nted.
The cavalry's r¡ght there.
Oh, my God!
Fuck!
Not a very n¡ce person, Mr. Sykes.
Appall¡ng eat¡ng hab¡ts.
Too bad th¡s show always
has the same end¡ng.
No, not th¡s t¡me.
Someone wants revenge.
No!
l guess the fans love a comeback.
M¡ke.
Look at me. Stay w¡th me.
Hold on. Hold on.
Stay w¡th me. M¡ke.
M¡ke, look at me.
Hold on. Hold on! Look at me! No!
Attract¡ve women l¡ke you
sell through the roof.
Just l¡ke Jeann¡e.
Al¡sta¡r.
Al¡sta¡r!
You're dead! l k¡lled you!
Al¡sta¡r.
Al¡sta¡r...
...t¡me to feel.
Gu¡lty.
Gu¡lty.
T¡me to d¡e.
Oh, my God.
No, M¡ke.
Hello?
Hello?
