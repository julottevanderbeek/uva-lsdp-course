He's learned his lesson.
He claims he's done with hacking.
He said he can lead us to Fr13nds and Russian cyber mafia
He wants to talk only to you.
And you are...whoami?
There's a reason why you're here.
A reason I'm here for.
So?
Paradise Pizza : the end of the rainbow
Dead.
I'm not a psychologist.
I don't care about your dreams.
What do you know about CLAY?
About your alliance with the Fr13nds?
Everything you want to know.
I got the idea from my biggest idol.
MRX had 3 rules:
In other words, don't limit your fun, don't enjoy things only in the virtual world
Hey! Just resting hasn't helped anyone so far.
Hope is the rainbow over the waterfall of our life.
Do you still want to pass the exam?
Try with learning!
Or do you hope someone will steal the exam questions for you?
I called Superman but he had no time.
Retard!
What kind of weirdo bird are you?
Paradise Pizza
The end of the rain-...
-bow.
That'll be 34.28
I said without anchovy
I'm not paying for this!
Don't be an ass, Oscar!
The rest is for you.
What? Are you crazy?
Mr. Anchovy gives you a hundred more if you get the exam questions.
Bachelor of Laws
The world doesn't need a savior
but everyday I hear people crying for one.
What?
That's Superman
It's okay.
Thanks.
You're such a jerk!
The bachelor exam questions were stored on
the central server of the university
What are you doing there?
No entries, no previous conviction
Do something with your life!
It's up to you!
And? why are you here?
Can't you speak or what?
Then no.
Let me guess...
you're one of those guys who thinks life's unfair for them
who feels like only passing by
invisible
just as the rest of society
In school you weren't even beaten up
because nobody gave a damn about you
That's all really really sad.
Do you know what I think?
it's all just a scam.
Computer stuff.
And you?
This and that
What kind of things? huh?
DDoS attacks?
Botnets?
Phishing?
Or are you just a script kiddie?
I hacked the University's server.
How did you manage to gain access?
Using a 0Day Exploit.
You know how to read machine language?
Simply as that?
Mhm
I am Max.
Benjamin.
Any plans for today?
The later the evening gets, the more drunk the guests become
How do you like my modest temple?
I don't even know half of these people.
All shit suckers!
Self-confident, charismatic
A winner
Close the door!
Let me introduce you
This is Benjamin.
Stefan
Benjamin
Benjamin Engel.
craziness
and so on
No last name.
Don't worry! His smile muscles were removed at birth.
Max said that you can read machine language
Machine language?
Anyone can say that!
It's not something that's easy to prove!
Prove it!
Or you won't leave alive.
Angel
Paul
Benjamin
Just Benjamin
The fun begins now!
Don't worry!
We're not the swindlers
What? Did you think that I live here?
Come on!
Come on! Go!
Make way!
You're the pizza bird!
Do you know each other?
It's his party!
What the fuck?
No last name.
I always stopped at warnings
never asked myself again after that
I can't anymore
I can't go any further
See ya after!
Now I remember you!
Benjamin! Benjamin Engel!
Our teacher forgot about you
and then you had to take the train back home!
It was interesting...
..the evening
Bye!
Bye.
We all knew that this day will come.
Your grandma needs professional help.
You must let go!
She's on really good hands.
Tickets, please!
I thought the cops have caught you!
It wasn't a good idea in the very first week to close the exit.
What's wrong?
You'll feel better.
Come on! I show you something!
Come on!
There are people out there, they think they're safe
They have no idea what's going on.
Security. Everyone wants security.
Security doesn't exist!
Once you understand this, you know
it's like you have the world served on a plate.
You only have to get it!
First: Don't enjoy your actions only in the virtual world
Second: aim for the impossible
MRX!
Never hide behind your computer.
MRX already knows this.
The main vulnerability isn't in applications or servers
Man is the main security flaw.
You hack people?
Exactly.
The most effective of all hacking methods, the great art of deceiving:
Social engineering
Man is by default trusting and confiding
Social engineering uses these two components
so that you can get anything you want:
Passwords, secret information, login data
Hungry?
Hold this!
How many chocodonuts do I get for this?
It's a new sales pitch? huh?
Pay for 10, get 8!
For those with chocolate it wasn't available.
What would I stand here for?
Who required this?
That blonde from there!
Come on! I'm hungry and got things to do!
There you go!
Have a good evening!
All good!
You must be bold enough!
Then the world is at your feet
Oh! Already late!
Are you ready?
Come on let's go.
But...
Where are we going?
Come on!
Go!
Why did you bring him?
You don't know if we can trust him!
You already saw what he can.
You can drive.
Don't make a big deal out of this! We'll bring it back!
Looking like this, you'll never get in!
Why does he come?
I thought I come with you!
What are you up to?
Not "you", "we" !
Come on! Get dressed!
Chop-chop!
This wasn't part of the plan!
Let's go!
Good luck!
Don't you come with us?
I'd rather not!
Let's go, my young boy!
Identity card?
Without despatch!
Fellow of the Danish Federation.
Without
Without despatch.
One of the guest speakers!
Danish people's front!
What has this to do with hacking?
The presentation's laptop
it must be connected to another wifi network
This is your job!
Don't forget! Aim for the impossible!
Shit! Shit!
Which?
What other network?
I don't trust the small one!
You don't trust anyone not even yourself!
Listen! They're sick of this!
The Federal Intelligence Service has people everywhere!
They're between us! OK?
They have this kid that never said a lie.
I'm invisible!
I'm invisible!
I'm invisible!
You assholes!
Time for a bit of blasphemy!
Dear fellows,
we're presenting you now our new wallspot!
A small flame that will burn in german's hearts!
Quiet!
Cut! Cut!
The lamers are coming!
Stefan! the keys!
I don't have them!
How do I know that what you're telling me, is for real?
What did you say?
Your insurance number.
Born in Friedrich
studies in Germany
Graduated as the best of the year
Investigator at the European Cybercrime Center in Hague
Two bank accounts: one at Densk Bank
other at Holland Direct Bank
During the study period, you had a problem
Since then you couldn't have kids anymore.
Because of an uterus disease
Your colleagues consider you cold
I consider you lonely.
This reminds me of the old times.
Having a computer crib or something.
We need a name!
We must become a brand! We must become famous!
All what attention generates is counterproductive.
We're staying off the radar.
Fuck the radar!
Brand is awesome!
Like Anonymous or Lizardsec!
Like MRX!
Are you all completely nuts?
I no longer do this shit with you!
Take the surprise from chocolate!
Take it!
Sure! No problem!
I follow the polls!
Who is "for" ?
We still need a name.
How about "CLAY" ?
as in "Clowns laughing at you"
because it's all about fun and because of the mask
Nominated with 4 votes.
For CLAY
We had taken a liking to this.
Our next target was a big pharma company.
Hi!
What are you doing?
Me? Nope.
You?
I'm looking for the man of the rainbow.
We must stop meeting in secret!
and also leave our covers!
You're such a fiasco!
You...for you it's easy!
You're...you're different! people are listening to you!
You're cool!
Maybe you're right!
When life gives you lemons, ask for salt and tequila.
We are fucking losers!
Fr13nds is part of the Russian cyber mafia
They hacked as in the past years many international targets.
The group has 4 nicknames to locate
The last one is still unknown.
The data they got was sold on the so-called "darknet"
and consumed by the Russian cyber mafia.
According to our newest investigations, at least one of the Fr13nds
members seems to operate from Berlin.
Our commission joins the Europol investigations.
Nobody knows the Fr13nds and their past actions better than Hanne Lindberg
Is it true that you're tracking the Fr13nds for 3 years
without success?
Yes!
OK. Any other questions?
Good.
Hanne!
I just wanted to say...
Glad to see you!
I hope you don't have any problems with this
No!
No. I'm glad to work with you!
Good.
One more thing...
The fact that we were together, no one must know it.
People are talking. Must lose the information!
While she was hunting the Fr13nds,
Max tried to get rid of the frustration caused by MRX.
Wanna take a ride?
Hello!
My name is Benjamin Engel.
The correct answer is B: Ottmar Hitzfeld.
Are you crazy?
What has this to do with CLAY?
What kind of fucking message is behind stealing a Porsche?
It's not like that!
It's not like a shitty Renault!
Superheros need a superhero car!
Exactly!
Moreover it's not stolen, it's won!
Forget it!
Here!
Excuse me, girls!
We were a bit late!
These guys are like Windows: it takes a while till they boot up.
Cheers!
You can be whoever you want!
Check this out!
Be open minded!
You achieved everything when you completed your ultimate challenge
So can Benjamin, for example, he has a huge potential, but he doesn't use it!
He hides behind the others. He doesn't open his mouth!
If someone must always pull you
then you'll never go far!
Most of the people can only follow rules!
It wasn't enough!
I passed the exam!
What are you up to now?
Do you know how I made it?
Nope.
I've intentionally answered wrong the questions.
Why?
There are so many possibilities outside.
I had the feeling that is not carved in stone that I pass the exam.
Like all the doors shut forever.
But now I've decided on a door.
Why are you driving a Porsche?
I'm the employee of the month.
Or maybe I'm also a superhero
and this is my superhero car
Yeah...maybe
I'd better go out
It fits to Porsche
Oh look who's here!
The pizza bird!
Get your hands off Marie!
Everything's alright?
Don't ask.
MRX sent a message!
until this moment.
In front of us we had the confidential cybercrime investigation
document they sent to Europol
We'll finish the fucker!
Let's do an attack that tops all!
We could hack a big bank!
Yes! the money of a famous company!
Bullshit!
We need an attack on something real huge!
Something able to reach the Olympus!
The Federal Intelligence Service.
What?
BND!
The king class.
The German Secret Service.
Bullshit! It's unhackable!
No system is safe.
And aim for the impossible!
Here you go, you pussy!
Accepted by password or address?
Idiots!
Ready?
Where's Benjamin?
No idea
Where have you been?
Leave me alone!
Let us in!
Don't act like a kid!
And you like an asshole!
You're nothing without us!
A nobody!
Nobody.
Nobody
First he has manipulated the printers over
the communication protocol
then he bypassed the security firewall
and stole data.
Our unhackable system
has been hacked in 2 minutes 23
You're saying this like you were excited about it.
Whoever did this is a genius.
We should have had recordings
They deleted all the video files and left something.
That was found about his body.
He was found in the woods.
Moritz Lauer, better known as Krypton.
Morning!
Get out!
Get lost!
What the fuck? you need us!
What?
I need you?
Or maybe you need me!
Do you know what?
You're nothing! you're nothing more than a shitty impostor!
All you can do is using people and manipulate them!
Stop! Stop!
Be quiet!
Quiet!
This morning was found the dead body of the hacker
which has the pseudonym "Krypton"
confront the BND with something that might be
the biggest scandal of its history.
At this time, the hackers group CLAY
seems responsible for the BND breaking.
You were the only one in the server room!
What have you done there?
We said that we don't touch anything,
take anything and turn on only the printers!
Did you leave any data?
I've found a hidden partition on the BND server
I have...I've cracked the password
and then downloaded some kind of employees list
I don't know...
I sent it to MRX.
Are you crazy?
I wanted to prove him!
I wanted to prove you!
You thought I'm a nobody!
MRX belongs to the Fr13nds
When he found out that Krypton worked for the BND, he eliminated him!
Now everyone thinks that we did it!
It's only his fault!
Austrian product.
Krypton has been admitted to the government agency and was eliminated.
What has this to do with CLAY?
I don't know.
We could fail.
I received a call from Hague.
They wanted me to make an evaluation
of you.
Your work
I didn't know that your chair isn't stable
Why didn't you tell me?
Where are you going?
To find some fun. This isn't fun anymore!
Krypton is dead, Max, dead!
And we'll get fucking blamed for all this scandal!
Benjamin could hand himself over to the police
and tell them how he built alone his shit CLAY!
Do you want sacrifice one of us?
You always wanted to run away!
I don't fuckin' care what you're doing, I'm out!
Stefan! Wait!
This is all my fault!
I must find MRX!
And then what?
It's not about us! it's about MRX
the Fr13nds
they are the target!
Benjamin is right. Running away doesn't solve this
There are so many tracks left there
It's just a matter of time till they catch us!
We deliver them MRX and the Fr13nds and we'll become invisible again.
Exactly.
When I said "we" I didn't mean "you" too!
Oh my god! what happened to you?
I'm fine.
What do you want?
...last night you suddenly disappeared and...
and I thought that...
You came here for Max.
Max? No!
It's better that you go now.
Are you building there a bomb or what?
Anything else?
What's wrong with you?
You're completely weird
Exactly
That's all you can see, right?
the freak weirdo
Do you know what?
I wish I had never met you!
Oh! here are you!
Come on fast!
He tried to contact MRX
His IP address is spoofed
he uses 100 different servers in Europe
He's changing his location at every 3 seconds!
I think I got something!
The server he uses more often points to this IP address
In Berlin!
Get as much information as you can, Katja
What are you waiting for?
We're running out of time!
I almost have it.
They're here!
Did you get it?
Let's get outta here!
Now.
We'll meet downstairs!
Nothing! as if the earth had swallowed him up!
I am suspended.
They're looking for someone else from Hague!
I'm sorry
What did MRX ask for?
He wanted us to send a Trojan to the Europol system
If someone has access to Europol, can track investigations
and tamper
What was your plan?
We wanted to know who is MRX
His identity in exchange for our freedom
We wanted to prove that he's behind Krypton's death
We wanted to disappear from the 1st position of the wanted list
We only wanted to be...invisible again
Stefan called the application
"the pregnant horse"
I want to apologise...
for the blue-eyed
like Marie.
You knew all the time what she means to me
and you didn't give a fuck
What can I say? I'm an asshole.
The statement is true.
I'm an impostor! I could never do what you can
I'm just a fucking script kiddie
I can't do more than copy/paste!
I don't even know how to program!
I didn't know that
Do you like this?
Love birdies!
It's the only entrance.
What are you doing there?
A fucking nail!
Take it out!
What are you looking at?
I want to be Benjamin again
I want to be invisible again
This is Anne! Call me as soon as you wake up!
You must come here immediately!
Finally no one else
You came...
Yeah, I came.
Oscar said that someone hacked the University's server some months ago
and stole the questions for the Bachelor exam
and got caught
You once said that
you must find out who you are
..and that there are a lot of opportunities outside
but you can be whoever you want
you can be anything
Do you understand?
I can be the federation!
You're a weirdo!
Do you come with me?
I already said that you're crazy!
Where?
Wherever you want.
Copenhagen?
You can go anywhere and want to go to Copenhagen?
Why not?
Yeah...
Why not.
What else do you know about me?
Do you know that I'm suspended?
You want to be invisible again!
But the Fr13nds know who you are!
You want a new identity
you want in the witness protection program! that's all you always wanted!
For this I give you MRX, the Fr13nds
It's not that easy!
The Federal Criminal Police Office will be successful
politics and media, pleased
You are rehabilitated.
Let's say I agree.
How will you get MRX?
Using a magic trick
There are holes in his story as big as the Death Star!
He's nothing
A no one!
He played with fire and got burned
but he can lead us to MRX!
If we have him we will also get the Fr13nds!
You're suspended!
The promise of the witness protection program must end.
I need you for this!
How should work this magic trick?
We will attack MRX's weakest point
his pride!
We got him!
What's his real name?
from New York
You should be the last one too
so that you're not alone
That's from Superman!
In a few hours you're a freeman!
New name, new city
There are holes in his story as big as the Death Star!
I'd like to ask you some questions.
Do you know this person?
No.
He said you were in the same class.
The freak!
Have you seen Benjamin lately?
No.
Excuse me.
What's this all about?
Benjamin is under the BKA's attention.
He declared that in the last months you met often
We did what?
He's completely crazy!
I'd never like to meet such a guy!
Thank you for having time for me!
It's about Engel
Or better said "your angel"
You know him?
Since he was young.
I have curated his mother.
What can you tell me about him?
He's uncommunicative
outsider
No wonders in his story.
His mother took her own life
Benjamin has grown up in unclear circumstances
His mother had an identity problem
Schizophrenia?
Multiple personality disorder
She had multiple personalities thinking they're all herself
The medication kept her at bay.
In the end she couldn't endure anymore.
Is it inheritable?
Possible.
What is it caused by?
It can be caused by a predisposition to other substances
Some medicines can make the symptoms even stronger
There are several triggers.
Ritalin?
Ritalin is one of them.
But what it's all about?
Is everything alright with Benjamin?
The laboratory results are here!
Let me guess! The bullets are from the 2nd World War!
Yes.
How did you get this wound?
what did hurt you?
Why were the car keys at you?
It is supposed that Stefan has driven the car!
What did you tell me about Paul? about his mother?
She died when he was young
That's you!
They're all you!
No. They're dead!
There are no dead bodies! No evidence!
In any damn hotel in Hague!
What you saw in the hotel room
doesn't exist!
You made them up in your imagination!
CLAY - that's you alone!
You are Max
What? Did you think that I live here?
You are Stefan!
You are Paul!
Every action, it was you!
Alone!
I don't even know one half of the people!
All shit suckers!
We need a name!
We must become a brand! We must become famous!
All what attention generates is counterproductive
We're staying off the radar!
Nothing off the radar! Brand is awesome!
Like Anonymous or Lizardsec!
Like MRX!
fucking nail!
I'm not like my mom!
I know who I am
That means that our agreement
disqualifies you for the witness protection program
No! You said we have a deal
a caution!
I get the witness protection program, that's what you said!
I'm sorry!
They killed Krypton
I betrayed MRX. They'll find me!
Do you understand?
We had a deal! I get the witness protection program!
That's what you promised me!
I'm sorry.
You're sick!
I'm not like my mom!
I'm sorry!
The Fr13nds will kill me like they killed Krypton!
I want witness protection program!
You promised me!
Congrats!
The collaboration between the Europol and BKA
has been from the start a composite of efficiency, professionality and certain
Responsible for this is Hanne Lindberg
an exceptional fighter against the cyber mafia
The Internet is not a legal black hole
its doors aren't invisible!
Anyone can be traced.
I asked them to bring you to the court.
I'm sorry for hacking you!
It wasn't fair
The witness protection program is literally a program
You have 5 minutes
Promise me that you're done with hacking
I promise!
No magic tricks anymore
Wait!
Just one more thing
How do you make this trick?
If you know how's working, it's less deceiving
Everyone sees what they wanna see
Take care!
She swallowed it hook, line and sinker.
The all time greatest social engineering trick
Not even the Europol knows now who you are.
What name did you pick?
No name
Where have you been?
They have my computer!
They know who am I, we all gotta get outta here!
What happened?
I was at Europol
How did you get in there?
I pretended to be one of the students from a group
it doesn't fuckin' matter!
The task.. was a failure!
They got.. they have all my personal details!
Everything! Do you understand?
We gotta get outta here! Immediately!
Come on! What are you waiting for?
You're one of us!
We don't forsake you!
Now what?
No system is unhackable.
Excluded from the witness protection program
are persons having psychic diseases
Once again
Give her very detailed information
this works only if you trust yourself
And if she doesn't feel mainpulated!
You can do it!
Only this is left
Ready?
We're all invisible!
What if she checked?
Don't worry!
She has checked.
But she has what she wants
No more magic tricks.
