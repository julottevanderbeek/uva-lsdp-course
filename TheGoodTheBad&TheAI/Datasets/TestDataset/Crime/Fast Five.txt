JUDGE: Dominic Toretto.
You are hereby sentenced
to serve 25 years to life
at the Lompoc Maximum Security
Prison system
without the possibility
of early parole.
Here's what we know so far.
This is all the aftermath of
a daring, daylight breakout.
There were 26 high-risk
inmates being transferred...
A daring midday breakout where everyone
on board has been accounted for,
except for one,
Dominic Toretto.
Police have
just released the identity
of the man they believe to have
orchestrated the shocking escape
that amazingly resulted in no
fatalities this afternoon.
He is former federal agent,
Brian O'Conner.
A fierce manhunt is underway
for three fugitives tonight.
Multiple federal and local
agencies have joined forces
in the search
for Dominic Toretto
and his accomplices Brian
O'Conner and Mia Toretto.
But despite every eye in the
country looking for them
where Toretto and O'Conner
are now is anyone's guess.
It's got to be it, right?
Let's get out of here.
VINCE: Whoa, whoa!
Easy, friends.
She's with me.
Mia.
Vince.
Buster.
Come on.
Dom here yet?
No.
When was the last time
you heard from him?
A couple of weeks ago.
Up in Ecuador somewhere.
VINCE: How does it feel?
What's that?
To be on the other side
of a wanted poster?
He'll show up.
Yeah.
Dom's?
Yeah.
Time for bed little one.
Can I bring him?
Of course.
MIA: Aw.
Good night.
Excuse me, sorry.
Why Rio, Vince?
You mean after you
screwed everything up in LA?
Ended up free-falling through
South America, you know,
hitting every hellhole
on the way down.
Would have kept
on going if not for Rosa.
Does he know?
So, listen.
There is a job coming up.
I was hoping Dom
was going to be here by now
but this one is clean enough
we can do it without him.
It's a good gig.
Couple of high-end cars, easy targets.
Guy I know is putting together
a team to swipe them.
Just need a few more
willing bodies.
I don't know.
Look, the way the car
scene is down here
we can unload them quick
and get top dollar.
It's easy money.
And from where I'm sitting,
it looks like you both
could use the payday.
What are you reading?
Travel guide.
Yeah?
Tokyo.
Moscow.
Goa.
You want to know what all of
these places have in common?
Huh?
No extradition.
Here we go.
Excuse me, buddy.
Okay.
Hey, we've found them.
Yeah, second-to-the-last
freighter.
What is it?
DEA tags. These cars
have been seized.
Look who showed up.
God, I'm so happy you're okay.
I thought I told you
to lay low.
Been running on fumes.
Had to make a call.
Hey! Quit talking.
We only got the two-minute window.
Let's go, Vince.
I'm taking the GT40.
Ladies first.
Hey!
MIA: Hey!
This car suits me better.
See you, baby.
It's okay...
we're all going to the same place.
We'll get the car there.
Change of plans.
Wait for my call.
Let's go!
Where is she going?
Where is she going?
Hey!
Hey!
We're being robbed!
Whatever happens, don't stop the train!
Go after the girl!
Hurry up!
Access card!
Get the access card!
Shit.
Bridge! There is a bridge!
Luggage car is clear.
Freeze!
Oh, Shit!
You had to make a call, huh?
Shitty call, O'Conner.
Shitty call.
You two stirred up
quite a bit of trouble today.
Three of my men dead.
Three DEA agents
along with them.
Of course,
this is business
and sometimes
things go astray.
All I care about is the car.
Tell me where it is,
and I'll let you go.
BRIAN: This roofing plastic says
you're full of shit.
I don't know how you guys do
business in your part of the world,
but here in Rio,
I like it when all parties
know what they're up against.
DOM: That's funny.
Because it goes both ways.
You know,
I hear your sister
is very beautiful.
Wherever she hides
I Will find her.
The American fugitives killed three
DEA agents during a train robbery...
...Police warn they are armed
and extremely dangerous.
Anyone with information should contact
law enforcement immediately...
BRIAN: Mia?
Hey.
You okay?
Yeah, you all right?
Hey.
Hey, yeah.
Just like a Toretto.
Where's Vince?
That's a good question.
He'll be here.
Guys, we're all over
the news.
They're blaming us for the Killing
of those DEA agents on the train.
Which means we just jumped
to the top of the wanted list.
The feds have got to show everyone
their agents are off limits
and they're going to send their best guys.
We got to get out of here.
One thing we know for sure
is that they wanted this car.
Because something is in it.
If we find out what it is, we'll
know what we're up against.
HOBBS: All right, listen up!
The men we're after are professional runners.
They like speed and are guaranteed
to go down the hardest possible way
so make sure you got
your funderwear on.
We find them, we take them as a
team, and we bring them back.
And above all else, we don't ever,
ever let them get into cars.
Crime scene is 10 hours old and counting, men.
Let's go hunting.
Agente Hobbs!
Chief of Police, João Alemeida.
Luke.
Sorry to hear about
the loss of your men.
Is all this really necessary
to apprehend two men?
Let me tell you something
about these two men.
One is a former federal officer,
been in deep cover for five years.
He knows every way you're
going to come for him.
The other one is a professional
criminal, escaped prison twice,
spent half his life on the
run avoiding folks like you.
Well, if there's anything
we can do to help the DSS...
Two things.
One, I need a translator.
We have plenty in the public
relations department.
Elena Neves.
A patrol officer?
You heard me.
But why? We have many
more experienced people.
I like her smile.
What's the second thing?
Stay the fuck out of my way.
Brian.
Hm?
I have something
I have to tell you.
VINCE: God damn.
What a mess!
Where you been, man?
You better check that tone.
And you just better answer
the goddamn question.
Stop it!
Both of you.
Where were you, Vince?
Guys all over the favelas
asking about you.
Couldn't get out of there without
leading them straight to you.
Had to wait them out.
That is such horseshit
That was your job,
and those were your guys! Hey!
Hey! Enough, O'Conner!
If he said he didn't do it,
he didn't do it.
Go walk it off.
REYES: Look, I would love to expand
my operations into your countries
but, quite frankly, your business
methods are too violent.
Let me tell you a true story.
Five hundred years ago, the
Portuguese and the Spanish came here,
each trying to get the country
from their natives.
The Spaniards arrived, guns blazing,
determined to prove who was boss.
The natives killed
every single Spaniard.
Personally, I prefer
the methods of the Portuguese.
They came bearing gifts.
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.
Things that the natives
couldn't get on their own,
but to continue receiving them, they
had to work for the Portuguese.
And that's why all Brazilians
speak Portuguese today.
Now, if you dominate
the people with violence,
they will eventually fight back
because they have nothing to lose.
And that's the key.
I go into the favelas and
give them something to lose.
Electricity, running water,
school rooms for their kids.
And for that taste
of a better life,
I own them.
Gentlemen.
I apologize for
the interruption.
Senior Reyes,
may I speak with you?
We've found them.
Pardon me, gentlemen.
DOM: Almost wish
I didn't see that.
Almost.
Wait, Dom.
Mia was on that train.
My sister!
I didn't know.
I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.
You set up the deal!
I thought the job
was for the cars.
I didn't know.
All they want is the chip.
Damn!
You should've come clean.
What's going on out here?
Nothing.
Please, Dom, just let me have the chip.
I can take this to them.
They'll give it to Reyes
and set things right.
Get out.
What?
Get out!
You never listen to me.
Not when I told you
he was a cop, and not now.
You never trust me
and look where it's gotten us.
Look at our family now.
I can't go home!
Your sister is stuck in this life!
Where's Letty, Dom?
Where's Letty?
Plasma cutter.
Wilkes, I want a list
of every place within 50 miles
that distributes
compressed gas tanks.
Pass me that manifest.
Officer Neves.
Been waiting for you.
You asked for me?
I did.
May I ask why?
My smile
is not that great.
Your husband was an officer who
was gunned down in the favela.
Six months later, you upped
and joined the force.
You're motivated.
Plus, I figure you're the only
one in Rio who can’t be bought.
Am I right?
Yes.
Of course I am.
Good news, bad news.
You know I like
my dessert first.
Back-checked
the rail line like you asked.
Found a couple of spots
where they unloaded the cars.
One set of tracks
headed west
until it hit the main highway,
then disappeared.
But another set
of tracks headed east.
A 107-inch wheelbase,
eight-and-a-half-inch tread.
The GT40 that was missing
from the manifest.
Followed the trail
a couple of miles.
Pretty easy in this scrub.
Can't move without
leaving a sign.
Give me the damn veggies.
The ground rolls into a hardpack
and we lost that track, too.
Not necessarily.
That road heads up through
the hills into the favelas.
Couple of years ago,
it was washed out by a storm.
It's all dirt a mile
from where you were.
If they headed that way, we'll
pick up their tracks there.
You come prepared.
I'm motivated.
HOBBS: All right, then.
Let's find ourselves a car.
What do you think?
Well, it's definitely
a custom chip.
Look at all these side menus
here for data entry.
Let's check this one.
Look at that.
Same building,
same order every week.
It's a delivery schedule.
What's this?
Drugs?
No. That's a dealer pack.
See, most major players,
they weigh their money
so they don't have
to constantly count it.
Right there,
that's 49 kilos.
in twenties.
You're saying each one of these
shipments is worth 10 million dollars?
Yeah.
I thought so.
So what is that?
A 100-million plus
in cash houses?
That's how he keeps it
off the grid.
I think it's safe to say that
Reyes is smart to want this back.
It's his whole network right
there, just laid out on a chip.
Wilkes, Fusco,
up the middle.
Mac, Chato,
flank north.
What about me?
Stay here.
Go that way!
The other two
went over the wall!
Come on, go! Go!
Get on the ground.
I got Toretto.
Four blocks north of your...
They already know
who you are.
Let's go.
All clear?
Clear.
You okay here?
Yeah. I'm good.
Thank you.
They're going to be looking for
the three of us together now.
We need to split up.
You and Mia head south,
I'll lead them away.
No.
Dom is right.
Look how lucky we just got.
What happens next time?
We have no choice
but to split up.
I'm pregnant.
I already lost
my family once.
I'm not going through
that again.
Are you kidding me?
No.
I'm not going
anywhere. Okay?
Dom?
Promise me
we stick together.
I promise.
Our family
just got bigger.
Something
doesn't add up.
Toretto and O'Conner.
They stay when they're supposed to run,
they steal gas then give it away?
Now they're killing
federal agents?
It doesn't make any sense.
Here's what makes sense.
All these guys are
is names on a list.
They come up,
we take them down.
Not a phone call more,
not a bullet less.
Wilkes, we get anything?
Standard forensics.
Shoe prints.
Hair and fiber.
Prints are all over the car.
Anything else?
Yeah, we tracked the owner
off the vehicle ID.
There are a couple of shell
companies in between,
but we finally traced it
back to a corporation
owned by an investor down
here named Hernan Reyes.
Investor?
If there’s anything illegal happening
in Rio, Reyes is involved.
Okay, then so are we.
If he could get us any closer to our
guys, I want everything on him.
Chato, you're
on the roof.
I want you on overwatch in case
somebody comes back for something.
Mac, give me a cross-check
on Reyes, full specs.
If he goes to the john, I want to
know how many times he shakes it.
You got it, boss.
Wilkes, Fusco!
Let's put all this
mess back together.
That's going to take a while.
Then you better get started.
They were taking
this car apart for a reason.
Let's put it back together
and find out what's missing.
Hey, Dom, what do you
remember about your father?
My father.
He used to...
He used to have a barbecue
every Sunday after church.
For anybody
in the neighborhood.
If you didn't go to church,
you didn't get any barbecue.
Every single day he was in the
shop, and every single night,
he was at the kitchen table with Mia,
helping her with her homework.
Even after she went to sleep,
he'd stay up
for a few more hours
so he could learn the next chapter
and help her the next day.
I remember everything
about my father.
Everything.
That's just it.
I don't remember shit
about my dad.
I don't remember
him yelling.
I don't remember
him smiling.
To be honest with you, I don't even
remember what the hell he looked like.
I don't remember.
He just...
He was just never there.
You ain't going
to be like that, Brian.
We can't keep
running, Dom.
We got to get out.
We got to get out now.
You're right.
Here's how we're
going to do it.
We're going to use this.
We're going do one last job.
We're going to take
all of Reyes' money.
Every dime of it,
and disappear.
Forever.
New passports.
New lives with no more
looking over our shoulder.
And we're just going
to buy our freedom.
That's right.
You realize we're talking
about going up against
the most powerful guy
in all of Rio?
Yes, we are.
Then we're going
to need a team.
Let's run through the bases real quick.
Who do we got?
First we're going
to need a chameleon.
Someone who can
blend in anywhere.
What else?
A fast talker.
Someone who can bullshit
their way out of anything.
I got that.
This guy is going to have
a lot of surveillance.
We're going to need someone
who’s good with circuits.
DOM: And with those circuits,
Reyes is going to have wells.
We're going to need guys
to punch through those walls.
MIA: What else?
Utilities and weapons.
Someone who ain't
afraid to throw down.
Someone to back up
every position.
BRIAN: Yeah, what else
do we need?
DOM: Most importantly,
we're going to need
two precision drivers.
Guys that don't crack
under pressure.
Guys that never lose.
You know we got that.
Aw, hell, no!
I see they really scraped
the bottom of the barrel, huh?
I guess they did,
since your ass is here.
When are you going to give
Martin Luther King his car back?
As soon as you give
Rick James his jacket back.
What's up, man?
What's up?
Hmm.
Sexy legs,
baby girl.
What time do they open?
They open the same time
as I pull this trigger.
Want me to open them?
I told you the skinny
chick had balls.
Looks like she started
the party without us.
Hey, anybody can talk shit
in Spanish, homie.
What's this guy saying?
Ugly is still ugly in
Spanish or in English.
Who are these clowns, man?
Circus clowns.
I thought cockfights
were illegal in Brazil.
I see you all have met.
You know when you called me
to come to Rio
I assumed it would be for something
more exciting than this.
Look at this guy.
Long time.
I missed you, man.
Good to see you.
Brother.
What's up?
Yo, check this out.
This is Tej.
Best circuit man
on the East Coast.
And this is my boy,
Roman Pearce.
We go way back,
I met this guy in juvie.
I pulled that job
with him in Miami.
I've heard about you.
Nice digs.
Yeah, well,
the Ritz was sold out.
So what's this
all about, Dom?
Yeah, man, why did you drag
us halfway around the world?
Because we got a job.
All right, so our target's
name is Hernan Reyes.
And he runs
the drug scene down here.
He's never been busted because
he doesn't leave a paper trail.
No paper trail
means no banks.
And no banks means
cash houses.
That's right.
Ten of them, to be exact.
Spread throughout the city.
And we're going
to hit them all.
All of them?
All of them.
That sounds crazy.
You bring us
to a whole other country
so we can rob
the dude who runs it?
I thought this was business.
Sounds personal to me.
Is that what this is?
I got love for y'all, but
personal ain't good business.
I can't do this, homie.
So what we're talking
about is $100 million.
You say what?
Hundred... See, sometimes
I be over thinking, man,
and I know we just met, but
you just, kind of, got to...
That's right, $100 million,
and everything we take,
we split even.
TEJ: That's a little over
$11 million apiece.
I am down.
I'm in.
Eleven million.
Sounds like a whole lot of
vaginal activity to me.
You can't pull off 10 heists
on the same mark.
You just can't.
As soon as we hit
the first one,
they're going to do everything
they can to protect the rest.
Exactly.
Nobody move!
That's all of it.
You a dead man.
You're all dead men!
You don't have
a place to hide.
Who's hiding?
THUG: Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Do you know whose house this is?
Whose money are you stealing?
We ain't stealing it.
You tell your boss
exactly who did this.
Tell him there's more coming.
Voilà.
Turn it over.
She's running on all eight.
Checks out fine.
Keep looking.
Boss, if something
was missing, we'd know.
It's a goddamn shame putting
bullshit like that on a classic.
You may as well slap
neon lights on it.
They took the chip.
We got a hit on the police scanner.
Armed robbery at a house in Leblon.
Address cross-checks
against property
owned by one
of Hernan Reyes' corporations.
All right,
if that's our guys
then whatever was on that chip
led them directly to that house.
It's them, for sure.
How do you know that?
Because no one else in Rio
is stupid enough to rob Reyes.
Explain.
They invaded
the Leblon house.
Who invaded?
The men from the train.
How much did they take?
They didn't
take anything.
They burned it!
They burned my money?
Yes. And said
there's more coming.
Okay...
Then this...
...is what
we're going to do.
Clean the houses.
I want that money
under lock and key...
...within an hour.
Understand?
Understood.
Number One
is on the move, man.
ROME: Two is on the move.
I got mine.
I got eyes on Five.
I know y'all said they were
consolidating the money somewhere, but,
y'all ain't going
to believe this.
Well, this job just got
a lot harder.
If he's moving it
into a police station
he's got some serious
brass in his pocket.
Looks like this is going to be a
shorter trip than I thought...
Hell, yeah,
we can't do this.
"Can't"'? You mean,
"shouldn't."
I think this doesn't
change a thing.
I say we stick to the plan.
You say what?
This just went
from Mission: Impossible
to Mission:
In-freaking-sanity.
Whatever, man.
I ain't scared, I'm just letting you all
know, going in that building is crazy.
BRIAN: I got this.
What time
was the robbery?
Around 11:00.
Here we go.
Enhance it.
Their faces are covered.
Run it through FRS.
Well, hello,
you son of a bitch.
Wilkes! Run the photos of known
associates of Toretto and O'Conner
against customs entries into
Brazil in the last two weeks.
Check planes, trains, boats, everything
short of the goddamn space shuttle.
They can change their names but
they can't change their faces.
Something big
is going down.
That's a 1970 Charger.
Fusco! Upload these specs
into the database.
Have the computer cross-check
it with overhead satellites
every 15 minutes,
the van behind it, too.
If these vehicles move in the streets
of Rio, I want to know about it.
Everything okay?
Everything is okay.
Who is this Hobbs?
This Federal Agent running around town?
Some American cowboy.
He's handled.
He killed sixteen
of our men.
Handle him better.
Look... He requested a rookie
patrol officer as his assistant.
They won't be a problem.
It's all here?
Yes.
What about Toretto and O'Conner?
Where are they?
Nothing yet.
But I have all our
officers searching.
Not good enough.
Put a price
on their heads.
High enough...
...to get every pair of eyes in
the city searching for them.
The beauty of public offices?
Public records.
This is where he's keeping the money.
The vault in the evidence room.
Um. Uh, yeah. Can I get everyone's
attention, right here, for a second?
We're talking about breaking
into a police station.
Is anyone listening
to those words?
Anybody? Popo?
Five-O. One-time. Pigs.
People we don't like.
You know, police stations are
designed to keep people in, not out.
That's why it's
a stealth mission.
We'll be in and out before
they even know we were there.
Well, we'll need
to get eyes in there.
At least to find out the make
and model of that vault.
So the vault
and then, so...
it's crazy.
Who's supposed
to do all this?
What do you mean?
Why me?
Because you got
the biggest mouth.
That's for damn sure.
Ooh.
Hello, beautiful.
Look at those dimples.
Sexy, sexy.
Love those glasses.
Where did you get them from?
Are those like Gucci frames
or something?
No English?
No, no, no. Damn.
How are you, sir?
Special Agent O'Conner.
US Federal Bureau of Investigation.
It says Caucasian.
That's a tan.
You know, a tan?
Look, I'm working this case and I
got some evidence here to be held.
But I need to get in and check
your storage facility first.
Nope.
Look, I know you're a true professional,
and I respect you, I promise.
You know, it looks like you
work out a little bit, too.
What do you bench,
about 350?
Ah, Shit.
Look, I'm just trying
to do my job, man.
My boss sent me here to just make
sure that everything was safe.
It will be safe.
Let me just come in
and take a quick peek.
Nope.
Come on, man.
Hook a brother up, please?
Nope. And you're
not my brother.
Brother from
another mother?
Look! No one enters the facility
but authorized evidence personnel.
Now stop wasting my time.
I'm going to call
the embassy.
No, no, no!
No, we're good.
We don't need to call them.
For what? We're good.
Here, I got the box.
We're all good.
I promise you.
Thank you so much for your time.
Swear to God, if you were on
the other side of that glass
I'd bust your damn face in.
Now translate that.
It's done. See, I think I make a better
special agent than you ever did.
Well, that depends
on how you define "special."
TEJ: Come on, now.
Let's see what we got.
Not funny.
All right, come on.
Dawg,
you still can't drive.
Now, I see why you're always
getting into accidents.
You can't even drive
a damn remote control car.
I'm going to need you
to shut up right now.
I'm not going to shut up.
Shut up.
Strap him in his
safety belt, man.
Give me the remote,
dawg. Go left.
It looks like something right over
there to the left. What is that?
BRIAN: What is that?
Bingo.
What is that,
six-by-six?
Eight-by-twelve.
Seven-by-twelve.
Fitted with 18-inch-thick
steel reinforced walls
with a insulated copper core to
protect against thermal lance.
A Class-3 electronic lock with
a surefire Griffin retumbler
and a biometric palm scanner.
Ten tons of
top-of-the-line security.
Do I want to know
how you know all that?
I had a life before
you knew me, O'Conner.
Let's just leave it
at that, all right?
She is a beauty,
though, man.
A "beauty"
as in "good"?
"Beauty" as in, she's going to
start off playing hard to get.
Then, no matter how much I caress
her, no matter how much I love her,
in the end, she still ain't
going to give up that ass.
This is one of the toughest vaults
to crack in the business.
We ain't gonna get anywhere with it
unless we got the duplicate to practice with.
About that...
Assuming you'll reach the safe
how do we get in?
Yeah, I've been thinking
about the way in.
The wall in the evidence room,
not so harmed.
So that's not happening.
Then we got this one here,
but there's a guard shack outside.
So that's no good.
But this one, this one shares a wall
with the basement bathroom.
So, what about the money?
That's gonna be some
heavy shit to move.
You're talking about
five-ton cash weight.
Yeah, but that's the thing
about the bathroom.
It's got a vent that leads
to the parking garage.
All we got to do
is pop that vent
and then pass the money through
to some waiting cars.
Leo Santo...
you're up.
Two to one says
you blow the wrong pipe.
Yo, why you got to be
so negative all the time, man?
I ain't negative.
I'm just positive
you're going to mess it up.
I'm telling you, man,
you got issues.
Next time if there's no
elevator, I'm not coming.
You need to learn
to relax, loco.
You better hurry up,
we got less than a minute.
Why do you always set
the timer so short?
Let's go.
I hope you know
where you're going.
I got this. Relax, man.
Relax.
...a police station.
Relax.
You used too much
explosive! Again.
Too much, too little...
it's all the same.
That's some Buddha shit you learned from
a book in the prison library, isn't it?
And what you're doing
there on the wall...
You got that from
the same book, huh?
You're so negative, bro.
Can I have some light?
MIA: Got it. We got it!
BRIAN: Yeah, we're looking
at four cameras.
Yo, that's some
high-end shit, too.
Marker optics.
Hundred-degree
field-of-view.
Ten seconds oscillation.
Yeah, that's
a narrow window, man.
Can't we just tap in
and replace the image?
No, it's hooked
into a digital sync.
They would know we were
in the system.
The best we can do is peek.
We're going to need some real
fast cars to get through this.
Not just fast.
You got a hard right
and a hairpin.
We're going to need
something agile.
You guys mock up a track.
O'Conner.
Let's go get some cars.
Nice.
Home sweet home.
BRIAN: Or that.
How about that?
All motor, no tuning issues.
I always wanted one of those.
Held the record on the
Avenida three years running.
Damn, bro...
You got a lot of balls to bring
your problems here, Toretto.
Not to mention a cop.
Yeah, we can keep
that on the low.
Word on the street is a lot of
people are looking for you two.
What?
You didn't think
we'd recognize you?
No, we're kind
of counting on it.
That little coupe may run
the streets around here,
but that monster has never
seen a set of tail lights.
Ever.
Well, she's about to.
Dominic Toretto's
ride in my garage.
Now that...
will be a nice trophy.
Let's go, legend.
Car for car.
Car for car?
DIOGO: You want it,
come and get it.
Let's see what they got.
Really?
Where did you get
that from? Papa Smurf?
Okay, O'Conner,
give it your best shot.
How was that one?
Camera caught you.
What?
Yeah, it still caught you.
Man, I was milking the hell
out of that thing, too.
We're going to need
a faster car.
I want my money.
Come on, man.
Yeah!
Let's get it! Watch this.
That's exactly why your ass
ain't been driving.
Terrible!
I think I'm in love.
That was real solid work.
I think Camera 3
still caught you, though.
Let's do it again.
TEGO: That's the piggy bank
you ordered.
You're kidding me.
Yep.
Where in the hell
did y'all get one of these?
Well, we had a life
before you met us.
All right, I'll get to work
on the electronic tumbler
but there's still
another problem.
Palm scanner.
And without Reyes' handprint,
Houdini himself
couldn't open this bitch.
How do you know
it's Reyes' handprint?
You got $100 million
in a safe.
You going to put somebody
else's handprint on it?
There you go with
that negativity, man.
That shit is eating
you alive.
You check that.
Yo, check that.
Shut up!
How are we supposed to get
Reyes' handprint?
DOM: Han.
You're up.
Sure. Nothing like
the easy stuff.
Let's go. I'll drive.
I make six bodyguards.
Seven.
You think that guy with a
fanny pack is a tourist?
So, how long were
you in the army?
That gun you pulled the other
day was a Jericho 941.
Thumb-racking the slide?
That was
straight-up Mossad.
I got out of the military
probably the same time
you quit smoking.
The amount
of chips you eat,
the way you always have to keep
your hands and mouth busy,
you were a two-pack-a-day
man for sure.
Unfiltered.
Well, this is a bust.
We're not going to be able to
get his fingerprints out here.
We need to do some more recon,
call in a couple of extra guys.
Or...
you don't send a man
to do a woman's job.
We're going to figure
this out, I promise you.
What's up?
I thought you were
more of a thong man.
We got the print.
Where?
Okay, that's crazy.
So, did he just slap that ass or
did he grab and hold on to it?
Ehhhhh.
Hahahahaha!
Hey, this will work.
TEJ: I'm impressed.
Got it?
TEJ: Got it.
But you still didn't
answer the question.
Oh, no. Guys, guys!
Guys, we have a problem.
The whole team just got burnt.
Now we're all wanted.
GISELE: How did this happen?
US Diplomatic Security Service
issued the warrants.
Agent L. Hobbs.
Hold on one second.
Hey, Dom.
Is that the guy you saw
in the favela?
Yeah.
Hobbs is the leader of the
elite task force for the DSS.
So he's good.
When the FBI wants to find
somebody, that's who they call.
Because he never
misses his mark.
This guy is Old Testament.
Blood, bullets, wrath of God.
That's his style.
And right now
he's hunting us?
Hm huh.
Dom, we got to move up
our timeline.
ROME Yeah, but how?
This thing's already been difficult
without Wyatt Earp on our asses.
If anything, we need
more room to breathe.
Roman's right.
Think we need to get
some fresh air.
We've got a hit.
'70s Charger.
Let's get a move on!
Eastbound on
Avenida Atlantica.
Move, move, move, move!
It stopped about
a block ahead.
Park it.
We're going on foot.
Hey, Toretto.
You're under arrest.
Arrest?
I don't feel like
I'm under arrest.
How about you,
Brian?
No, not a bit.
Not even a little bit.
Just give it a minute.
it'll sink in.
BRIAN: We didn't kill
those feds. That was Reyes.
HOBBS: I don't give a shit.
I'm just here to bring in two
assholes whose names hit my desk.
Yeah, that sounds
like a real hero.
That's funny.
From a guy who took the oath of a cop,
then went against everything it stood for.
Or some wannabe
tough guy prick
who beat a man half to death
with a socket wrench.
Yeah, real tough.
You turn around and put your
hands behind your back.
I don't think so.
Your mistake is thinking you
got a goddamn choice, boy.
And your mistake?
Thinking you're in America.
You're a long way from home.
