You have a way with words, Gaga.
My friends...

Please sit.
REZO:
Gentlemen...
...we have before us a rare opportunity.
When our syndicate

...their interest was in the one thing
we all had in common...
...money.
How do we ensure the highest profit
at the lowest risk?
l know you all worked hard to get here.
lt is not easy to do what we do.
And even those with a lot of power...
...had to pull many different strings...
...to get our fighters released
and brought to this one spot here on earth.
But, here we are.
Enjoy.
KUSS: Some of you here

Why don't you shut the fuck up already?
Oh, l'm sorry,
l didn't hear what you said...
...because, my hearing,
sometimes it comes and goes.
What was that?
Fucking Americans, all talk too much.
Now l'm gonna come over this rock,
kick your ass, right here, right now.
Hey. Stop right now.
You fight in the ring, nowhere else.
Fuck you. This ain't , bitch.
You fix your fucking mouth

You need to shut your fucking mouth.
Want some?

GUARD 1 : Stop, stop, go.
GUARD 2: Hey.
lnside.
TURBO:
You're a tough guy now, huh?
Yo, Russia.
Russia, you out there?
l can't fucking breathe
in this fucking box.
You know that was some bitch shit
you pulled. You know that, right?
Sneak a nigga when he ain't looking.
That's some bitch shit.
That shit might be cool where you from.
Where l'm from, bitches do that.
You hear me?
Bitches.
l'm fucking talking to you, dude.
Where l come from...
...people don't talk
unless they have something to say.
Yeah, well....
Just saying
if that's how you gotta win...
...maybe you shouldn't be here.
You hear that?
Maybe your fucking ass
shouldn't be here.
Yo, Russia.
Russia?
l need to take a shit.
Say, man, l need to take a shit,
and l can't find no place to do it.
-Yo!
-What?
Fucking need to take a shit,
and l can't find no place to do it, man.
What do you think l should do?
l think you should fucking hang yourself.
Fuck you.
l can't find no place to squat myself.
What the fuck was that?
Russia?
Russia, they've got fucking things
moving in my cell, man.
-Russia?
-What?
What's your name, man?
Seriously.
Just be quiet.
You can't fucking tell me
your name, man.
You can't fucking tell me
your fucking name?
Fuck you.
l'll fucking talk to myself.
Have a better fucking conversation
anyway, you fake-ass caveman.
Motherfucker.
Fuck.
Somebody let me out this motherfucker!
Fuck.
GAGA:
No, no, no.
We're not gonna wait.
We're gonna see our clients now.
Gaga, please.
See what you could do.
Brings back memories.
lt was a good fight the other day.
How are you?
How am l?
Yes, how are you?
Did you set me up?
What's going on?
What sort of fucking tournament is this?
Boyka, cut to the chase.
What's going on?
We're being forced to do hard labor.
Hard labor?
What the fuck are you talking about?
l'm talking about l'm breaking rocks
with a hammer.
Some fucking chain-gang shit.
Son of a bitch.
Yeah. You gonna do something about it?
Consider it done.
Lying cocksuckers.
l swear to Christ, l'm gonna fucking
clip somebody before this day is over.
KUSS: Gentlemen.
-You cocksucker.
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Of course you know Mr. Rezo.
My friends.
You seem agitated.
Agitated?
Why is my fighter doing hard labor?
Because you want him to lose,
of course.
What did you expect?
Did you really think...
...that l would not arrange
for things to go my way?
You motherfucker, you know how much
cash l dropped to get my fighter here?
Of course l do.
l will fucking destroy you.
Okay, perhaps.
Or maybe
there is another way we can go.
Remember what l said at the dinner?
How do we ensure the greatest profit
at the lowest risk?
So my suggestion is this:
Go under your mattresses,
find all the money you can...
...liquefy everything
and put it all on the Colombian.
Do this and you will leave here
richer men than ever you could've dreamed.
-What about our fighters?
-Fuck your fighters.
Fuck our fighters?
They're the weak horses.
We put them down with the rest.
Can you guarantee
that my fighter doesn't win?
This l absolutely guarantee.
Hey. Would you stop pulling?
l'm not pulling.
Yes, you are.
You see me move, you move with me.
l ain't Ginger Rogers,
and your ass ain't Fred Astaire.
Give me a warning,
and l'll move with you.
-Okay.
-Okay.
l'm going to move now.
That's funny, huh?
Wanna do this again?
End up in the motherfucking hole?
ls that what you want?
Sure, it is.
So l'll tell you what.
l want nothing more
but to get into your ass.
But we're gonna do it in a ring
where it matters. Got it?
-Fine.
-Fine.
Uh-- On three.
One, two, three.
You know what?
Where is that Colombian
motherfucker anyway?
Thanks.
So, what did they clip you for?
What? More bread.
TURBO: What'd they pop you for?
What's your sentence?
l speak English.
Do you?
l was just asking what are you actually
in this motherfucker for?
Committed crime.
You don't wanna talk?
Fine, we ain't gotta talk.
-Talking's bullshit anyway.
-lt's not my strength.
No shit.
You know what's going on, right?
What?
This shit's fixed.
BOYKA:
What shit?
TURBO:
This shit. This fucking tournament.
And what's worse is we was fixed
in this fixed motherfucker.
That why the fucking Colombian's
in a cell sipping on pi?a coladas...
...while we're busting our asses.
Of course.
What do you mean of course?
This is surprise to you?
l came here to win.
So did l.
So this don't piss you off at all?
Winning takes many things.
Who can be the best fighter,
yes, of course.
But most important...
...who can survive.
Survive what?
ln here, the people you fight...
...they are not just in the ring.
Hey, come here.
GUARD:
The key.
BOYKA:
We can train?
One hour.
Are you fucking crazy?
Fuck that.
l can barely fucking walk. Working out--
ls that all you got?
l'll give you a little test.
GAGA:
Luka, listen to me.
l need you to liquefy the fund.
Yes, all of it.
No, no, no. By tomorrow.
l-- l don't give a flying fuck how.
Send a pigeon if you have to, okay?
l know, Vito.
l know you vouched for me, Vito.
But look, l need another million
like yesterday.
Vito, this is a sure thing. lt's a lock.
MAN:
Yeah.
TURBO:
Well, well, well.
Look who's here.
What the fuck is he doing here?
Breakfast is over.
This is some fucking bullshit.
lt's a fucking joke.
l'm suppose to fight like this.
They starving me out--
-You curse too much.
-Fuck you.
Then quit.
Go back where you fucking came from.
Maybe we can turn this around.
-What the fuck does that mean?
-We can turn it to our advantage.
lmprovise.
Adapt.
Overcome.
-What?
-Nothing, nothing.
How?
We can say this is work.
Or we can say this is training.
TURBO:

Three.
Six, seven, eight...

Squeeze that in your hand.
Take the oil and rub it on your knee.
Do it.
How do you know this?
lmprovise, adapt, overcome.

l know a whole lot of shit. Now let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
Three, two....
Children?
You have children?
Yeah.
Boy and a girl.
You?
No.
Ever wanted any?
Never?
No.
-Never wanted a son--
-You ask too many questions.
This is why you want to win?
Children?
l've been locked up for a long time.
l mean, l ain't seen my youngest,
my sweet girl, for....
Since she was four weeks old.
Water?
What about you?
l have to win.
You have to win.
You would not understand.
Try me.
God has given me a gift.
Only one.
l am the most complete fighter...
...in the world.
My whole life, l've trained.
For what?
l must prove l am worthy of something.
Damn.
l'm gonna feel bad
when l'm whipping that ass.
lt's about time.
l'd like to place a new bet.
Absolutely, Mr. Gaga.

The winner is Boyka from Russia.
REZO:
l'm worried, Kuss.
That Russian Boyka looks very strong.
Too strong.
l can only imagine
that the American will look the same.
Perhaps your methods...
...are inadequate.
l will step up my efforts.
Look, you motherfuckers wanna tell me
what this shit's about?
l want to talk to you about
your training partner.
-My who?
-The Russian.
Well, you gonna have to talk to the Russian
about the Russian.
l understand
you two have become sexual.
What you say? Because sometimes
my hearing comes and goes.
-They say you two are lovers.
-They say?
You should know we don't allow
such perversions in this institution.
l'm gonna fucking kill you.
Take him to his cell.
TURBO:
Hey, hey.
Hey.

You take care of business.
You and me,

Right?
You know, when l was in the hole...
...l remember hearing great stories
about Yuri Boyka.
King of prison fighters.
l thought he must be....
But then he lose.
He lose to an American boxer.
They say Boyka's a wounded horse now.
He's a champion of the toilets.
lf l'm champion of the toilets...
...what does that make you

lt's okay,
Make sure you spend some quality time
with your American boyfriend.
lt will be his last.
Get them to work.
How well do you know the forest?
-What?
-Look, it's no time to bullshit me.
You were military, yes?
Listen to me.
You will not survive the fight tomorrow,
they will make sure of it.

You must give a fuck.
TURBO:
Shit.
These motherfuckers will not break me.
l'm gonna finish this shit.
BOYKA: This is not the time.
You must leave here.
TURBO: Where the fuck
am l supposed to go, huh?
This will give you a chance.
TURBO:
A chance for what?
Security out here
is not as heavy as it should be.
No one expects one of us to escape.
We're here to fight.
l'm going to break your chain.
Make run to the forest.
You know how to survive.
-So, what, you my guardian angel now?
-l'm no angel.
No. l'm gonna fight this fucking guy.
-Not in your condition, it is not a true test.

There's no honor in dying for money.
Well, l ain't gonna die, okay? Fuck that.

Fuck.
Okay, all right,

BOYKA: Right.
-Okay.
Hey.

Hit it again.
Damn it, hit it. Hit it.
Hit it, damn it, hit it.
TURBO:

...you were the last on the list.
-Where is the American?
KUSS: He'll be found and dealt with.
l want to speak to Gaga.
He has requests now.
Do you think Gaga
or anyone else can help you?
-You think Gaga gives a shit about you?
-He gives a shit about his money.
And that's what l am.
l would not be so sure about that.
What does that mean?
GAGA:
lt means there's been a change of plans.
l made a new wager, Boyka.
Sorry, my friend.
You just can't beat the Colombian,
not with your knee.
You are with these animals?
l'm with the money.
l'm always with the money.
We have been forced to improvise.
You will now fight the Colombian
in the final.
What will ye give me?
And l will deliver him unto you.
Excuse me.
You fucking Judas!
Okay. Okay, l'm a fucking Judas.
Now, that makes you what?

Die.
You did well, Mr. Boyka.
l don't want your fucking prize.
Just show me the front door.
Yes, well, about that....
About what?
l'm afraid we have a problem.
You see, the agreement
of this tournament...
...was that one man
would receive his freedom.
You're talking about agreements now?
Unfortunately,
we have not recovered the American.
And since you're responsible
for his escape...
...l'm afraid you have forfeited your chance
to leave here a free man.
Anyway,
you're not walking free out of this facility.
lndeed, you're going right back
to the toilet you came from.
l did what l had to do.
Where l go now...
...l don't care.
Good, then you'll not annoy me
with any resistance.
A bus is waiting outside.
l will give you this, you're quite a fighter.
Quite a fighter.
Too bad you're such damaged goods.
l have already arranged
to have you picked up.
Pity about your freedom.
This is my freedom.
You fucked with the wrong nigga.
Let's go.
BOYKA:
Why did you do this?
TURBO:
Stop asking so many fucking questions.
BOYKA:
