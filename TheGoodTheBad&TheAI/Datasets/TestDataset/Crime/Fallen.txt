HOBBES: I want to tell you
about the time I almost died.
I never thought it
would happen to me.
How did I get into this fix?
How did it all begin?
No, no, no. If I go back to the beginning
that'll take forever.
I thought the governor didn't approve
of this.
STANTON: The more they don't approve,
the more they want to watch.
So, what is this,
six notches on your belt?
Eight.
- Congratulations.
- Fuck you.
Ask me more nicely, huh?
GUARD:
John Hobbes.
You're wanted in the dance hall.
REESE: Hey.
- Edgar Reese.
REESE:
Well, well, well. Look who's here.
It's the brilliant detective
who sealed my brutish fate.
That's right.
So, what is this?
They making you famous now?
Oh, big time. They're gonna put me
in the movies. Documentary.
All courtesy of the ACLU.
They shoot me getting smoked.
Who knows?
Maybe it'll be a big video rental.
All these society ladies showing it
to their dinner guests.
"Ooh, you see that there?
That's a urine stain, ladies." Ha, ha.
"Oh, my, it's not urine." Ha, ha.
- It's good to see you, Hobbes.
- It's good to be seen by you, Reese.
Sure.
You're, uh...
...my best pal.
Ah.
You're still a good fella.
Open the gate.
You know,
you remind me of somebody, Hobbes.
Oh, indeed you do. Indeed you do.
- Do you like riddles?
- No, I don't.
Here's a beaut.
Why is there a space
between Lyons and Spakowsky?
- What?
- Come on. You should know this one, pal.
You should know this one.
Open your eyes. Look around sometime.
Open the gate.
Remember this, Hobbes.
A day, a week, a month.
What are you, a Nazi now?
It's Dutch.
What goes around...
...really goes around.
You have a safe trip, hear?
REESE:
I'll be looking for you.
What goes around really goes around.
REESE:
Hey! Howdy, folks.
Ladies, gents, cocksuckers, pederasts.
I hope you all enjoy the show. Yes, I do.
Hey, I'll give you a blowjob
if you get me out of this, baby.
Yee-haw!
Time is on my side
Now, you always say
That you wanna be free
Baby, come on, go ahead...
...light up my life!
HOBBES:
Something is always happening.
But when it happens,
people don't always see it...
...or  it...
HOBBES : The criminals
don't accept consequences, huh?
They kill somebody,
somehow it's not their fault.
JONESY: Hey, look who made it.
LOU: Mr. Consequence.
JONESY: How'd it go?
- He died.
- Told you.
LOU:
Gracie, he got one more.
GRACIE: Hey, detective, nice to see you.
- How you doing, Gracie?
- Don't tempt me with that.
JONESY: Oh, man. Sorry.
What's your poison?
We're working on some Beck's.
We got some Guinness.
We got some Bass.
- Budweiser's good for me.
LOU: Budweiser?
HOBBES: Yeah.
- Good.
- We're going imported here.
GRACIE: Please.
- You can't afford it, I'll buy.
- I can afford it. Budweiser.
- Okay.
- Well, at least have a Bud Ice...
...or a Bud Dry or something.
Lou, it is just a Bud, okay?
- You guys want anything?
JONESY: No.
MAN:
Here's your Bud.
He was one of the most notorious inmates
in this prison.
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sweetheart.
You're an unusual cop, Hobbes.
- Really?
- Mm-hm.
I've been in this precinct about what, uh,
five, six months?
And everybody says,
"Hobbes don't take no cream.
Hobbes don't take no cream."
Now is that true, or what?
No, I don't like cream, Lou.
LOU: That means "no"?
- Yeah, it means "no."
Now, is that "no" as in "never,"
"no" as in "sometimes"...
...or "no" as in
"I do, but I don't like to talk about it"?
"No" as in "never."
This is a big city, Hobbesy.
We got a tradition to uphold.
Something wrong with your ears?
Man says something, he says it.
It's a hypothetical. You know,
a cop who's trying to make ends meet...
...wants a little something on the side.
I don't like cream. And I don't judge.
You don't judge?
He's a fucking saint, huh?
So you're telling me
that under no circumstances...
...would a holy man like you
ever, you know...
...break the law or do something...
Look, Lou...
...I could jump across the table,
snatch your heart right out of your chest...
...squeeze the blood out,
stick it in your front pocket. I could do that.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. If I lost control.
But if I did...
...I would be no different
than the people we bust.
Now, as to your general question...
...you take any cop out on the force,
cream or no...
...99 percent of the time,
they're doing their job, aren't they?
- Ninety-nine five.
- Point five.
So he or she, cream or no...
...is doing more good out there
on the street every day...
...than any, uh, lawyer or stockbroker...
...or, uh, president of the United States
can ever do in their lifetime.
Ah. Cops are the chosen people.
Amen.
Guess I'm switching to Bud.
Gracie, come here and get this foreign shit
off my table...
...and bring me three Buds.
She's been waiting all her life
- For a man of
COP: Over there.
Can you believe that? Ha, ha.
MAN:
Yo, give me a burger?
Damn it, Charles, what took you so long?
There's a room up on 13 that--
You know what you'd look like
with this sandwich up your ass?
Pardon me?
Like a fat, stupid fuck
with a sandwich up his ass.
- Charles, I hate to do this but--
- Yeah.
Put the job where the sandwich goes.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello?
ART:
Here we go. Juice, pretzels, apple.
Peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Uncle John, will you please
make my lunch tomorrow?
Here's Toby.
- Hey, Mr. Hobbes.
ART: Hi, Toby.
I can't be having the same thing every day.
What do you want, uh,
peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
- No.
- Heh.
HOBBES: What? Jelly and peanut butter?
- No.
HOBBES:
All right.
- I love you, Dad.
- Wait, wait.
Don't forget your Uncle Johnny.
- I can feel the love in this room, man.
- Bye, Uncle Johnny.
SAM: Bye.
HOBBES: Be good, hear.
- Have a good day at school.
- Okay. Bye.
You're doing a good job, Art.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Why don't you sit down with me, huh?
Let's talk a bit.
- You're not in a hurry or something?
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
I can relax today.
Besides, what are they gonna do?
Fire me?
- How are you doing?
- Okay.
- You're all right?
- Yeah.
I love you, Johnny.
You ever--?
You ever think it would be easier,
your life would be easier...
...or something if maybe me and Sam
were not living with--?
No, no, no, no, no.
- Maybe Marcy wouldn't have left.
- Later for Marcy.
If she loved me,
she would have never left.
Besides, family's always first.
You're my brother, right? Huh?
Yeah.
I love you too, Art.
But don't make the boy any more
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
- No more peanut butter and jelly, heh.
- Okay.
HOBBES:
cop knows.
Often you don't remember till later on.
But then you look back and you realize...
MIKE: Hey, good morning, detective.
- Mikey, Mike.
- How you doing, lieutenant?
STANTON: Hey, Hobbes.
Look who's feeling good today.
Hey, what can I say?
Hey, you're looking better than me.
DENISE: Got a call on 4, Hobbes.
- Thank you, Denise.
- Jonesy.
- Hey.
How's everything today? Good?
Detective Hobbes.
MAN :
Hey, pal, you got a
STANTON: Blanche?
MAN: 4541...
- Who's there?
MAN:  Magoo.
Clue, Magoo.
Couldn't sleep last night, Jones.
Who can?
Remember I used to get calls, 2 or 3:00
in the morning from Reese?
He loved you, Hobbes. He truly did.
Somebody called me last night.
Imagine that.
- Denise?
DENISE: Yeah?
Send a car over to 4541 South Stender,
Apartment 2.
Make sure we gain entry, huh?
DENISE: Got a body?
- It's probably just some knucklehead...
...who saw me on TV
trying to impress his girl.
- How'd I look last night?
DENISE: Fabulous.
- You saw that? On four different channels.
DENISE: You're a god. You're a god.
Name's Muskavich. Russian expatriate.
Super says no family, no friends,
no nothing.
Why is he dead then?
What you got, Jonesy?
I got puncture wounds.
Look for a syringe or something.
Eighteen.
- What is that, his 18th victim?
HOBBES: Could be.
Could be.
Very tidy.
The DOA's been dead awhile,
so what the hell is this, huh?
Killer slept over and then, uh,
had a nice, neat breakfast.
Looks like it.
Check this out.
Shit.
- What?
HOBBES: It's a riddle.
Reese, in his cell before he died,
he asked me:
"Why is there a space
between Lyons and Spakowsky?"
JONESY:
Yeah?
An accomplice?
Reese had an accomplice?
Unless it's a copycat.
You know, maybe the, uh...
...prison guards or the people
that made the documentary.
- You got a minute?
- I'll be there in a second.
Fifty people must have seen
that documentary by now.
Well, me and Jonesy will run them down.
Yeah, go ahead.
Fingerprint. Perp wore no gloves.
He left prints on the spoon and
the cereal bowl like he was advertising.
Maybe his prints aren't in the system.
- I hate to be stupid--
- Enjoy it, Lou.
--But is, uh, motive still something
we think about...
...or are we thinking these crimes are done
out of sickness?
Eh. Number 2, Lou.
Everything is motive. Sickness is motive.
Look sharp, Bud.
The coroner's prelim on the Russki.
Isn't that that wacko poison that, uh,
Reese used on them Arab kids?
HOBBES: Tiff?
- Yeah?
You like, uh, riddles? You know, uh,
puzzles and shit? Brainteasers?
Sure, as long as I'm doing the teasing.
Why is there a space
between Lyons and Spakowsky?
What does that even mean, man?
Come on.
We had a Spakowsky in my rookie year.
South Precinct.
- Come again?
- Not your Spakowsky. This guy's a cop.
Keep talking, Lou.
The guy's a fucking asshole.
He's the King Kong of assholes.
He's a fucking legend.
His name's up on the wall.
What?
LOU: Some chief in the '30s
thought it would boost morale.
They kept it up till like '81 or '82 and
it got to be like some fucking booby prize.
Remember it was downtown in the lobby,
till they did the remodeling?
- Must have passed it a thousand times.
- I just need to open my eyes...
...and look around sometime, huh?
LOU: Yeah.
Lyons, I don't remember him,
but Spakowsky, he was around.
This guy was so fucking mean...
...his wife shot him in the foot
and he couldn't get disability.
HOBBES: Lou, who was '65, huh?
Who was in that space right there?
LOU:
You got me, bud. I don't know.
So you're saying they took a name oh'?
Why did they do that?
I don't know. I called Records.
They say they don't know who it was...
...and they don't know why it's not there.
Well, we better find out, huh?
Ah, lieutenant,
just the man I wanted to see.
Booya.
-"Robert Milano."
- That's right.
Cop of the Year, 1965.
Eight months later, goes up to a cabin
in the middle of nowhere...
...dies cleaning his gun.
So it's either two things:
He was dirty or it was a woman.
What?
I met him once, Milano.
He had a poker up his ass
but otherwise he was a good cop.
- What I wanna know is--
- I know what you want.
I can't help you.
You can't help me?
Look...
...do all of us a favor, okay?
Whatever you find out,
keep it to yourself.
Hey, I got something for you.
Documentary on Reese.
Yeah, thank you. You're a real white man.
- Jonesy.
- Yo.
- Tape on Reese. You wanna view it?
- Give me a sec.
- What do you got on Muskavich? Anything?
JONESY: Fingerprints were a bust.
The crime scene says
the killer probably had dark hair.
- He probably was left-handed.
- Yeah, like Reese.
Uh, he had bad teeth.
Found a piece in the corn flakes.
WOMAN :
Directory Assistance.
HOBBES: Yeah.
Can you give me a number on a Milano?
- Sylvia M-I-L-A-N-O.
WOMAN: Hold, please.
HOBBES:
Hey, lieutenant.
LOU: Excuse me, boss.
STANTON: Yeah, yeah.
If somebody dies
because you kept your mouth shut...
...you're the one holding the bag, not me.
- When it's a perfect world, let me know.
In the meantime,
it's not me keeping his mouth shut.
- That clear enough for you?
HOBBES: Yeah, yeah.
WOMAN:
I'm sorry, there's no listing.
Yeah, okay, okay, thanks. Now listen, listen.
You still there? Hello?
Yeah. Check and see if there's a G. Milano,
a Gretta Milano. Can you do that for me?
WOMAN: Hold, please.
- All right.
Syringe had the same prints.
- So now what? Video time?
- Yeah. Yup.
Uh, you know, I was thinking...
- Hey, don't hurt yourself.
- Eat me, Lou.
WOMAN:
Hold for the number, please.
Whoever did Muskavich,
knew the poison that Reese used.
He quotes Reese. He could be a cop.
Yeah, he could be, huh?
- Huh, Lou, could be a cop, huh?
- What?
GRETTA :
Leave a message. Thank you.
Are you watching, Johnny boy?
I hope you're paying close attention.
- Wait a second.
- What?
Check something out.
The, um, language he was speaking,
later?
That's Dutch?
HOBBES:
That's what he said.
What's he speaking now? Is that Dutch?
This now?
This is, uh, mumbo-jumbo, gibberish.
Oh? You sure on that?
GRETTA:
Who is it?
HOBBES: It's Detective John Hobbes.
I'm looking for Miss Gretta Milano.
GRETTA: Oh, yes. You left a message.
- Yes.
I wanted to talk to you about your father.
How you doing?
May I come in?
Sure.
You're, uh, surrounded by angels.
I teach theology at the university.
Ah, I see, I see. Very beautiful.
GRETTA:
Thank you.
Why do you wanna know
about my father, detective?
Well, um, it's, uh, 30 years later...
...and the files are sealed...
...and my boss was told to, uh,
let it alone...
...so here I am.
Okay. Well, I can tell you
what my mother told me before she died.
Why do you wanna know?
I mean, are you just curious or...?
No, ma'am, no. See, I'm the detective
who, uh, caught Edgar Reese.
I'm not sure if you're familiar with him.
He was just executed.
- Yeah, I read about him.
- Right, right.
And this, uh, Reese fella, he, um...
...in a roundabout way,
he gave me your father's name.
Did Reese like to sing?
Yeah, he did, actually.
And at the execution,
did he try and touch you or grab you?
Yeah, he did. He shook my hand.
Yeah.
- You want some coffee?
- Sure.
One condition.
You and I never spoke.
You say nothing to your boss or partner.
Nothing goes in the files.
My name and everything I say
is just between us. Is that agreeable?
Will I get a cup of coffee if I say yes?
Detective, my dad was a good cop.
"Pride of the force" and all that.
And then he shot himself.
A reporter found out
my father had been under investigation.
He'd caught a killer,
but copycat crimes started.
Evidence mounted up against him:
fingerprints, witnesses.
The press never got real proof,
but my father's medal was rescinded.
I see.
So you're saying that, uh, when he died,
someone made this evidence go away?
The mayor and the governor,
chief of police, they all needed a hero.
And some of these people
are still important today.
- I see.
- No. Not yet, you don't.
My father saw the evidence, told my mother
he didn't stand a chance to beat it.
So he went to this cabin
in the mountains.
It's a place that's been
in my mother's family for generations.
He went there and...
The thing is, detective...
...I know my father was innocent
of those murders.
How do you know?
How do you know he was innocent?
It's 30 years ago.
It's not important any more.
Uh, well, it's important to me,
Miss Milano.
Don't you want the truth to come out,
the killer to be punished?
- Of course I do.
- But?
Are you afraid if you tell me
your life may be in danger...
...or something like that?
- Yeah.
- And that's it?
Yes.
Okay.
Okay. Thank you very much.
- Uh, for the coffee as well.
- Okay.
Oh, listen, uh, if I have any more questions,
can I call you?
I'd rather you didn't.
Detective.
Do you believe in God?
Yeah. I mean, you know,
I go to church every now and then.
What I see in my line of work,
faith's a little hard to sustain.
Good luck.
HOBBES: Sometimes I think the basic job
that human beings have...
...is just to figure out
what the hell is going on.
Now, what was she hiding?
What was she so scared of?
And then her question about God
What the hell is that all about?
You never know.
Down to the smallest thing.
The man who passes you on the street,
catches your eye. Does he know you?
Is he a homicidal maniac
who hates you on sight?
WOMAN :
I'm coming apart a little at a time.
Art?
- Art.
- Huh?
Wake up.
Sam?
Come on, go to bed. Sam, Sam.
All right. I know. I know.
Here we go. UP- UP-
SAM:
I'm going. I'm going, Uncle John.
HOBBES:
Up.
Hello?
Hello?
HOBBES:
Let's go, Sam.
SAM: Good night.
HOBBES: Good night, son.
ART: Johnny?
- Yeah?
You ever get scared?
Yeah, sometimes.
Oh.
Me too.
Good night, Art.
MOOHR : Hello?
- Mrs. Moohr? Uh, this is Charles.
Apparently, I must have gotten drunk
or something...
...because the last few days...
Am I working tonight?
MOOHR: You  Charles.
- I quit?
MOOHR: Yes. You insulted Harry
and he hired someone else.
Oh, but-- I mean, how--?
Look, I'm really sorry, I...
Could you apologize, please,
to your husband for whatever I--?
MOOHR
We always liked you, Charles. Goodbye.
Yeah. I--
REESE :
--47, 48, 49, 50.
HOBBES:
Hello?
REESE:
I played Reese's tape on the phone
to a linguist guy. He's coming down.
- Yeah? What's the prelim?
- Said it sounded Mideastern.
- Anything on Muskavich?
JONESY: Only the pizza.
Now we're hitting
your area of expertise, huh?
Pizza is the staff of life.
Without pizza and other fine Italian foods,
there would be no happiness, okay?
There was one slice left:
Garlic, linguiga and pineapple.
Plus, there was nothing
in Muskavich's stomach.
- So it was the killer's eats.
LOU: Hell of a clue.
- You better write that one up for the journal.
- I will, Lou. And I will laud you copiously.
Thank you.
Detectives? Your guy's in Video.
Oh, hey, the linguist guy's here.
Yeah. I'll, uh, be right there.
HOBBES:
Any luck?
John Hobbes,
Professor Richard Louders.
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.
This is completely exhilarating.
Who is this convict? Can I speak to him?
Not now. Have a seat.
Professor says it's a language.
He's just never heard it spoken aloud.
- Meaning?
JONESY: Some kind of antique.
Well, I believe this is a Biblical tongue,
Syrian Aramaic.
Only a few nomadic tribes still use it.
- So you don't know what he's saying?
- I haven't the faintest.
He's not too pleasant, is he?
If you could spare me a copy,
I'd be more than happy to work it.
Hey, appreciate it.
Uh, listen, if you could wait out front
for 15 minutes...
LOUDERS: Of course.
-...we'll dupe one for you.
LOUDERS:
I'll be waiting.
JONESY: See you in a minute.
LOUDERS: Bye, detective.
- Syrian Aramaic.
- Imagine that.
I got something else too.
I'm looking up this, uh, clipping...
...of Reese, high-school baseball team.
He bats right.
He throws right.
JONESY:
What are you saying, Hobbes?
Reese pulled off some of the sickest shit
on record.
He's speaking a language
...and you're worried
because he's ambidextrous?
I'm worried about everything.
- Hobbes, call on Line 1.
- Thank you, Bill.
Detective Hobbes.
MAN :
Hey, pal, need another clue?
Jonesy, that pizza place
with the Number 17?
JONESY: Yeah.
- That close to Grove?
I think so.
They're in the same place, exactly.
Yeah?
- It's like he's laughing at us.
- He is.
LOU: Cash, not a check?
WOMAN: That's right.
- Jonesy?
JONESY: Yeah.
HOBBES:
Take a look at this.
What the hell is this, huh?
You know what's scary?
Going home last night, this guy's walking
past me, he's going the other way.
He looks me right in the eye.
The kind of look like he knows you.
You know what I mean?
It's the same guy that's in the bathtub.
The stiff.
- You're shitting me.
- I shit you not. Same guy.
Oh, man.
I ain't smart enough to figure
what's going down.
HOBBES:
Me neither.
DETECTIVE:
From under the sink.
- Same poison?
- Same poison.
- Better get that down to the lab.
- Sure.
HOBBES: What else you got?
JONESY: Okay, the number on his chest.
Last Thursday it's 18, now it's 2?
Everything's under a Charles Olom,
but it looks like that's an alias.
So, uh, we're running his prints.
JONESY: To quote Yogi Berra,
"It's like déjé vu all over again."
STANTON: You mean Reese?
JONESY: Yeah.
STANTON: And whoever is doing it
has a thing for Hobbes.
JONESY:
Seems like.
STANTON: How is he?
JONESY: Who, Hobbes?
How is he ever? He's fine. He's great.
STANTON: Well, if it starts to work at him,
let me know, okay?
When it starts to work on me,
I'll let you know that too.
Thought that was you.
What are you doing, more, uh,
historical research?
Mm.
Nice talking to you. See you Monday.
All right, Lou.
BOY 1:
Come on, Jimmy.
BOY 2:
Over here, shoot it!
HOBBES:
Shoot it, shoot it, shoot it!
ART:
Come on, come on, Sam. Okay.
Aw. Okay. That's okay, that's okay.
The score is tied.
HOBBES: No, no, no, 19-17.
ART: Okay, 19-17.
BOY 3: You can take him.
- Come on, Toby, pass the ball. I'm open.
HOBBES:
Come on. Take the ball back.
BOY 4:
Mr. Hobbes.
ART: Johnny's gonna make the point.
He's got the ball.
- Hi, Art.
- Hey, how you doing?
HOBBES:
Shoot on three, two, one.
Oh!
That's it for me. I've gotta go.
No, I gotta go. I have a long drive.
Art, you wanna get in here?
- Uncle John, but he's a spaz.
- Hey, hey.
Don't disrespect your father, okay?
You understand me?
- Yeah.
- Cherish what you got.
ART: Sammy, come on.
- Okay? Get on in there.
- Want some of this?
JONESY: I didn't bring my shoes.
HOBBES: What's up?
- Tiffany didn't get you?
- No, what's up?
- You know how weird this case is?
- Hey.
- We got a positive ID on Charles Olom.
Real name's Mickey Noons.
Born in Canada, illegal alien.
Blah, blah, blah. Small time shithead.
- That ain't bad.
- That ain't it.
Noons is the guy that killed the Russki.
It's his prints
all over Muskavich's apartment.
What?
Let's see, Noons poisons Muskavich...
...dumps him in the tub,
sets out the corn flakes.
Three days later somebody does
the same to him.
- Exact.
- Yeah.
Exact because Noons and Muskavich
were killed by the same person.
- What? Some kind of ringmaster?
- I think so.
- Hey, Art. You and Sam don't forget lunch.
ART: Okay.
I don't know.
I can't seem to get my mind around it.
- I got a bad feeling about this.
- Yeah, me too.
Somebody's playing with my dick
and it ain't me.
- Yeah. See you.
- Bye.
- Ten minutes, Art.
ART: Okay.
HOBBES:
There are moments which mark your life.
Moments when you realize
nothing will ever be the same...
Sometimes you can feel
such a moment coming.
...strong people keep moving forward
anyway...
- Miss Milano.
- Oh, hello.
I went to your family's place
up in the mountains.
GRETTA: Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.
Let me get that for you.
The trees and the water.
Absolutely beautiful.
What does "Azazel" mean?
Your father, he wrote it in the basement
on the wall, then he painted over it.
My dictionary, uh, says that it's the, uh:
"evil spirit of the wilderness."
Whatever that means, huh?
One of the books your father had up there
talks about demons...
...and how they move by touch.
What is that?
Walk away, Mr. Hobbes.
- Say again?
- If you enjoy your life...
...if there's even one human being
you care about, don't take this case.
Uh...
It's out of my hands, Miss Milano.
I mean, it's my job.
Bye, Mr. Hobbes.
- That's it?
- Yeah, I'm afraid so.
- Jonesy? Fax.
- Uh, thanks.
Hey, phone company sent
MUDs and LUDs...
...for Noons' and Muskavich's apartments.
- Yeah?
See those calls there?
They were made right around the time
they were killed, give or take.
The killer called my house
from the scene of the crimes?
Sure looks like it.
- Reese used to call all hours of the night.
- Reese is dead.
Yeah, but whoever's doing this
is in league with Reese...
...or he was imitating Reese.
I know he's still calling my house.
How many times I gotta change
my phone number?
The more you change it, more it looks
like someone on the inside.
Yeah. Like a cop?
Yeah.
Hey, it's nothing to me...
...but the egos upstairs...
- You hear me?
- Both ears.
Good.
I'm gonna lose my sense of humor.
What do you got?
Translation from the Aramaic:
"I can't enter you by touch.
But even when I can get inside you,
after I'm spirit, I won't.
I'll fuck you up and down, left and right."
That's in the Bible.
"If that doesn't work, I have other ways."
We need a translation of the translation.
Yeah.
- Anything else?
- Uh, no, I'm okay. Thanks.
BARTENDER:
O'Rourke's.
HOBBES:
I like the night.
Sometimes you come
face to face with yourself.
SAM:
Now put that card back in.
- Anywhere.
ART: All right.
- Okay. Tell me when to stop, okay?
- Okay.
HOBBES: Yeah. Can you pronounce it
for me one more time?
Okay, professor,
I think I got it. All right. Bye.
REESE'S VOICE :
I can get inside you. After I'm spirit, I won '2'.
Fuck you, up, down, left, right,
coming, going.
MIKE:
Right. Fifteen minutes.
Mm-hm.
Hi. Can I help you?
Yeah.
- You're releasing a Richard Suckle.
- Okay.
- He called a cab.
MIKE: I'll have him brought right down.
- Hey, Tiff, looking good today.
- Thanks.
- Rap sheet on Bobby Stiggers.
- Thank you.
- So Hobbesy, tell me something.
- Shoot.
The other day you were
in the basement, uh, reading an old file.
Yeah. What about it?
It looked like there was some kind of map
in there. You go somewhere?
- I went up to the country.
- Yeah? It's great to get out of town.
- Lovely. Fresh air, you know?
- Yeah.
I used to do that. Go up to a house
in the mountains and sit by the water.
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.
So I'm curious, uh, where'd you go?
Why do you ask, Lou?
Come here.
Come here.
Come on, come here.
Time is on my side
LAWRENCE :
ls on my side
- Lou?
- What?
You're always saying
That you wanna be free
Mike.
Mike.
Mike?
Yo, Mike.
Yeah, detective.
Why were you singing that song, huh?
- Song?
- Why were you singing that song?
- I was singing?
- Why were you singing that song?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You don't?
MIKE:
No, I don't.
HOBBES:
You don't know what I'm talking about?
MIKE:
Uh-uh.
Hey. Hey!
Hey, you.
Syrian Aramaic?
How clever.
- Jesus.
- Honey, is there some--?
It's true what I said though.
I do know who you are.
Azazel.
Where'd you get that?
From Milano's place?
You found something up there.
Well, some things, pal,
you shouldn't know.
Like what?
Like what?
If you know, you should never, ever tell.
Beware of my wrath.
H93'-
Well?
What were you doing just back then?
- What are you talking about?
- With the singing.
You were singing.
- I wasn't singing.
- You were.
Lawrence was singing
and Mike was singing some '60s thing.
There you go.
I wasn't singing.
I hated the fucking '60s.
I wasn't singing.
HOBBES: I appreciate your situation, okay?
I really do.
Your father, mother, they're dead.
Their lives were ruined. Your life is ruined.
I'm very sorry about that.
But I gotta know what's going on, okay?
If this thing is what it seems to be...
...if this thing is what the book says
that it is, then...
- Is this for real? Do you believe this stuff?
- I believe more is hidden than is seen.
Well, I believe what I see.
And I'm still trying to get my mind around
what I just saw, okay?
Something threatened me.
And this Reese,
he threatened me in Aramaic.
Wait, what else did Reese say?
Hey, I'm asking the questions here.
You answer the quest--
You answer the questions I ask, okay?
If I don't know what's going on--
We're not supposed to know.
We're not supposed to see.
It's like the Mafia. They don't even exist.
Okay, okay.
That's good. That's a start.
They don't even exist.
So where are they from?
Who the hell are they?
Mr. Hobbes,
there are certain phenomena...
...which can only be explained
if there is a God...
...and if there are angels.
And there are. They exist.
Some of these angels were cast down.
And a few of the fallen were punished
by being deprived of form.
They can only survive in the bodies
of others. It's inside of us.
Inside of human beings,
their vengeance is played out.
That's it?
Come on, get out of here.
I mean, come on. What--?
I mean...
Miss Milano, I'm just a cop, okay?
I'm a detective.
My work is based upon evidence, facts.
Mine too. Mine too.
And aren't your facts here
rather resistant to normal interpretation?
So you're saying
that Edgar Reese is actually--
At the time you knew him,
he was not himself.
- He was Azazel?
- Yes, Azazel.
Sadistic, left-handed, likes to sing.
Reese? Why does he focus in on me?
You got his attention
so he tried to get inside you.
He shook your hand.
That didn't work, so now he's gonna try
and find some other way.
Like he did with your father?
Okay.
How do we fight him?
Is it even possible?
I believe it is. And I'm not alone.
There's a network. I don't even know
who they are. I just have numbers.
Okay, these people know the--
We believe that God limited demons
and made them mortal...
...and he put a few of us here
to fight them.
Us? Us who? Who us?
You saying me? I'm one of these people?
Ha. I don't know. Maybe, maybe not.
You're just doing your job.
Okay. Touché.
So these demons are mortal.
They can be killed.
- By the right person.
- Who?
This is religion, Mr. Hobbes. These are...
These are matters of fate and divine order.
The right man--
- Or woman.
- Yes.
- It could be you, me, anybody?
- Yes.
The right person of the right character
with the right knowledge...
So this is what you've been doing.
This is what-- You've been preparing
for this, haven't you?
Can I ask you something personal?
Everything's personal if you're a person.
Is this why you live alone?
Well, there's a difference between
risking for yourself and someone else.
That's true.
I mean, if I had someone...
...I'd wanna share my life and my thoughts
and my work with them.
But if I shared this, I'd put them at risk
and I don't have a right to do that.
Well, you can talk to me.
You don't have to. I'm not saying that...
I'm not, you know...
Do whatever you wanna do. I'm just saying
you can, if you want to, you can talk to me.
Thanks.
That's a very nice thing to say.
I've got to go. I hope I've been helpful.
- Thanks for listening.
- Okay. Thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just about to tap you on the shoulder.
You're a friend of John Hobbes,
aren't you? Huh?
I'm Jay Reynolds.
Uh-uh. You know.
Ooh. How lovely.
Hmm. You're not just Hobbes' chippy.
Have we met? You seem vaguely familiar.
Mm. Come on, tell me.
I'm about to find out anyway.
Foreplay. Ha, ha.
MAN: Coming through. Watch out.
JAY: Hey. No, you don't.
GRETTA:
Please, help me!
Go! GO!
-0
Go!
CABBIE:
Jesus, man, you all right?
You all right?
GRETTA:
Thanks for coming.
I ran.
He came after me and I ran.
- Maybe you weren't ready yet.
- That's the point. You have to be ready.
You know what it is?
I never believed this day would come.
I thought God would make it up to me.
I'd be a good girl...
...and God would show me
an angel instead.
Do they know who you are?
We shouldn't be seen together.
Not any more.
Wipe your tears.
- You wanted to see me, lieutenant?
- Yeah.
- How you doing?
- Fine.
The murders not getting you wound up?
You can bag the chocolates.
You ain't gotta talk to me sideways.
What's up?
Where were you
when Muskavich and Noons were killed?
Where was I? What? Am I a suspect?
Sit down.
Not to me, you're not, but...
Look, lieutenant, you know, hey,
what is it, the phone records again?
What do they think? I committed
the murders, called my own house...
...then I ran home
and answered my own phone?
No, it's something else.
Your prints.
MY prints? On what?
On that fucking little coin of yours.
- Where?
- Noons' place.
Oh, shit.
This is a frame-up.
- Is it?
- Yeah. Anybody could have got those coins.
They could have got them, uh,
when I'm at the store or something.
- They could have taken them off my desk.
- We always said it could be a cop.
Yeah. We did always say that.
I'm not stupid, you know.
I know you know more than you're saying.
So tell me.
You don't really wanna know, lieutenant.
You'd have to be there.
I was there and I don't even wanna know.
Try me.
You remember Robert Milano?
No, wait, listen to me.
This is exactly what happened to him.
He was framed.
I'll give you some advice, okay?
Let go of it for a couple hours.
Go home, see your family.
Take a load off.
HOBBES: The hell with Stanton.
The hell with all of them.
Nobody likes to get
the shit kicked out of them.
But evil just keeps on coming.
You know what I mean?
You saw it before, but now it's in your face,
laughing at you.
SAM: Hi, unc.
HOBBES: Hey, Sam.
- How you doing, Toby?
- Hi, Mr. Hobbes.
- You're home early today.
HOBBES: Yeah.
For a change.
Hey, Art, you move my address book?
What? No. Um...
What?
Art?
What's wrong with your eye?
Who hit you in the eye?
I fell.
You fell?
I fell, or something.
Art, people don't fall down
and get a black eye.
- No?
- No.
Oh. Um...
All right, all right, all right.
It's okay, it's okay. Just, look...
What happened?
Sammy hit me.
What?
It was an accident though.
He didn't mean to though.
It was an accident. It was an accident.
Uncle John. Uncle John.
Sam?
Where's Toby?
Outside, I guess.
Okay, go back in the house.
- Toby?
- Hey, Hobbes.
HOBBES:
You leave my family alone, you hear me?
- Uncle John.
- Go back in the house.
- What's going on?
- Go back in the house!
- You leave my family alone.
- Why?
You come after me.
Now I come after you and yours.
HOBBES:
Hey.
- Toby, you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.
HOBBES:
Go right home. Go.
TOBY: Okay, I will.
HOBBES: Run.
What's the matter, pal?
Are you afraid to fight me?
Come on, Hobbes. Come on out.
Come on, Hobbes. Come on.
HOBBES:
Put the gun down.
I knew you'd come out.
Put the gun on the ground!
I know you, Hobbes.
Set the gun down, sir.
Put the gun down!
Yes, it is
Hey, pal.
Wake up, Hobbes.
I'm not that easy to kill.
When my host dies and I move as spirit,
no man can resist me.
What are you gonna do, arrest me?
What are you gonna tell Stanton?
I'd love to hear that one.
It's me you want, isn't it?
Why don't you just kill me, huh?
But I'm still having fun.
Aren't you still having fun'?
MAN 1: He was standing in the street,
yelling at him...
...shooting at him.
Finally, when the officer...
MAN 2:
I guess that's it.
NEWSMAN 1:
We're back at...
...the scene here of this...
There's no question
that the dead man shot first?
MAN 1: No question at all.
My wife saw it too, if you wanna ask her.
- Lieutenant.
- A schoolteacher, huh?
What am I gonna say?
What am I gonna do?
We know that he fired first.
Witnesses corroborate.
But his gun was filled with blanks.
And he got the gun out of a stolen car.
- It was a setup.
- A setup?
That's right. A setup.
- He set it up for you to kill him?
- Art.
- Committed suicide by-- Ugh.
HOBBES: Excuse me one second.
Art.
What the hell
are you doing out here, huh?
You take Sam home, lock every door,
every window in the apartment.
You don't let anybody in. Nobody.
Can you do that?
- Can you remember that? All right, do it.
- Yeah.
- Johnny?
- Yeah?
Are you mad at me or something?
No, Art. Never.
Just do what I told you.
Hate to see the mighty fall,
you know what I mean?
Now it's letters. Fuck you, Lou.
Lieutenant, I told you, it's a cult.
Some weird, psycho,
Aramaic-Satanist reincarnation cult.
HOBBES:
He's got A-P-O written on his chest.
He's trying to send
some kind of message.
The killer's sending a message.
Hobbes...
...this time, you are the killer.
- Yeah, sort of.
- No fucking "sort of."
No breaks. No benefit of the doubt.
We're going back to the precinct. Now.
NEWSMAN 2: Tonight, another
very shocking murder in the city.
A well-respected schoolteacher
apparently opened fire...
...on an off-duty police officer tonight.
Police say the officer...
...John Hobbes, was forced to return fire.
NEWSMAN 3: We're on the scene
of a most unusual homicide tonight.
STANTON:
Close the door.
Detective John Hobbes shot and killed
a high-school math teacher.
The police have not yet identified
this man.
STANTON:
Okay.
I talked to the schoolteacher's wife.
He got married four months ago.
She's pregnant. He just got a raise.
So much for suicide by cop.
The shooting team will need your gun.
I'll get the hearing as soon as I can.
People want the world to make sense.
If the only way I can get the world
to make sense for me is to arrest you...
...then I'll have to do it.
Get the fuck out of here.
- It was a clean shoot.
- Yeah, I know.
It doesn't help, but I know.
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.
JONESY:
You wanna talk?
From where I sit, we're dealing with shit
that ain't in the manual.
Where do they buy coffee with dirt in it?
Can you tell me that?
What's the point of life, huh, Jonesy?
- The point?
- Yeah.
- Of life?
- Yeah.
- The point of life. You want a cigarette?
- No, thanks.
The point of life is we catch bad guys.
Yeah. That's what I used to think.
It's not good enough, Jonesy.
You can shoot me for talking like this but--
Hey, it's 2:00 in the morning.
You can talk any way you want.
What are we doing here?
You know what I'm saying?
Why do we even exist? Us?
Maybe it's God, Hobbes.
Yeah, it could be.
I have a hard time believing...
...that we're part of some huge
moral experiment, you know...
...conducted by a greater being than us.
I mean, if there's a greater being
than we are...
...why does he give a shit about us?
There's five billion of us. We're like ants.
I mean, do we care what ants do...
...you know, from a moral standpoint?
- Ants? No.
- Right. 80--
- I'm following you...
...but at the same time I'm losing you.
- I know.
- I mean, are you heading someplace here?
- That's my point.
Are we headed someplace?
If we don't figure it out...
Maybe if you figure it out...
...you die.
Heart attack, stroke.
You figure out what's what...
...you don't get to hang around any more.
You get promoted.
Meanwhile, Delores...
...she says we're put here to do one thing.
One thing?
- What's that?
- It's different.
It's, uh, different for everybody.
Hers is lasagna.
Lasagna?
And just one thing, not two or three or--?
Maybe two, I don't know.
It's just her opinion, Hobbes.
But it's like...
...when a moment comes...
...we either do the right thing...
...or wrong.
And when do you know
when your moment comes?
- So, like, this could be it for me?
- That's the beauty. You never know.
- Hello?
- John? Is that you?
- Yeah.
- Hi.
- I just wanted to see if you were okay.
HOBBES: Yeah.
Let me, uh... I'll call you back.
I'll call you later.
Okay.
That was the killer.
We're gonna arrange things later.
I'm going home.
Yeah, fuck it.
HOBBES: I killed someone.
He got me to kill an innocent man.
GRETTA :
HOBBES:
What do they want, Gretta?
- Just tell me what they want.
GRETTA: The demons?
They want the fall of civilization.
The fall of Babylon, " as they put it
HOBBES: The whole thing?
GRETTA: Yeah.
HOBBES:
Hell, they're doing a good job, aren't they?
You know, after I shot the teacher,
Azazel moved to someone else.
GRETTA:
Are you sure? After death?
HOBBES:
I'm positive. After death. Yeah, I saw it.
I was looking through
one of your father's books...
says, uh, "outside--"
I guess that means outside the body.
"Outside, they can survive
for one breath only. "
GRETTA: There's a Hebrew text says
the breath can carry them for 500 cubits.
HOBBES: A cubit, that's a distance
or something, right?
GRETTA:
Yeah. From your elbow to your fingertips.
So 500 cubits would be what?
About a sixth of a mile?
HOBBES:
Yeah, well, you're right then. They, uh...
I guess they are limited in certain ways.
What are you thinking?
I don't know.
I don't know. You okay?
Yeah.
HOBBES:
All right. Well, then, uh...
...maybe I'll check up on you tomorrow.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good morning, Sam.
- Good morning, Sam.
- Oh, hi, Uncle John.
Oh, hi.
SAM: Thanks for tucking me in last night.
- You're welcome.
NEWSWOMAN :
We sent Michael Aaron out to the scene...
...where he'll be ready
with a live report shortly.
HOBBES:
Sam?
Sam? You were asleep last night
when I tucked you in, weren't you?
I don't know. All I remember
was somebody tickling me.
Tickling my chest.
Why'd you write that?
- Where's your father?
- In the bedroom.
He's a sleepyhead.
NEWSWOMAN : If you watched
the national news just last week...
you might have seen
a similar case in Boston...
Art?
Art?
Art?
Art?
- Hello.
- Hey, have you seen the news?
The cop was shooting first.
And he kept on shooting.
- Yeah.
- Our friend Lou's coming to get you.
He's gonna bring you down
for more conversation.
- Lou?
- No.
- They get him yet?
- No. Not yet.
- Yeah, I gotta go.
- Okay.
Sam, here. Put these clothes on.
Get dressed right away.
- Why?
- Just do what I tell you, please!
- Sam, you ready?
SAM: Yeah, almost. What's going on here?
HOBBES:
We're just gonna play...
...a little trick on somebody.
- Cool.
No, we're, uh, going out the window.
What about my dad?
He's, uh, sleeping. He's still asleep.
Excuse me, Sister. How you doing?
- Good.
- Good.
Uh, does "apocalypse," uh--
That mean anything to you?
NUN:
Sure it does.
"Apocalypse" was the Greek word
for "revelation."
Revelation.
- You mean like the book of the Bible?
- Yes.
- Revelation. All right. Thanks.
- Mm-hm.
- Give me a, uh, pack of cigarettes.
- Sure.
- Any special kind?
- No, any kind.
VENDOR:
Okay, out of 5.
Detective Hobbes?
VENDOR:
Sir, you forgot your change.
Detective Hobbes.
Detective, hold up. I wanna talk to you.
MAN:
Hey.
- Go, Sam. Run.
SAM: Okay, okay.
Down the stairs, down the stairs.
Go, go.
All units in the area--
Why don't you close that coat up?
SAM:
Cigarettes?
I thought you quit.
I thought they were bad for you.
I did quit and they are bad for you.
You know what's going on, son?
The police think that, uh,
I did some bad things.
- You are the police.
- Not any more.
- Well, why do they think you did that?
- Well, because...
Because somebody, uh...
...made it look like I did.
I once saw that on a show.
I wanna talk to you
about something else too.
About your dad.
He's not asleep, is he?
No, son. He's not asleep.
Did it hurt?
I don't think so.
- Do you think he's gonna go to heaven?
- Yes.
Yes, I do.
Anybody deserves to go to heaven,
it's your dad.
I think so too.
We got no place else to go.
This is my nephew, Sam.
Okay. Hi, Sam.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Gretta.
- Hi.
You're in your pajamas.
I wasn't expecting company,
but I'm glad you're here.
Why don't you, uh, go over there
by the fireplace and get warm, huh?
Azazel wrote on his chest.
Unless I do something, he's gonna--
- I'll get you a coffee.
- Thank you.
I think I got my mind
around this thing now, but let me...
...let me run this by you, okay?
After the host body dies...
...the demon can survive
for one breath or 500 cubits, right?
- Right.
- At the same time...
...Azazel says to me,
when he moves as spirit, no man can resist.
Somebody he can't get into by touch,
he can still get into by spirit.
Because, if when he's in spirit form...
...he's fighting for his life,
he's gonna be that much more powerful.
Please tell me what you're gonna do.
HOBBES:
Whatever  do...
...I have to make sure
that you and Sam are safe.
Will you take him somewhere
nobody knows about?
Sam, wake up.
Listen, uh...
I gotta go.
You're gonna stay with Gretta
for a little while.
Maybe for a long while.
Now, I want you to remember this:
Whatever people say about me...
...or whatever I do...
...I just want you to remember
that I'm doing it for you.
Because I love you.
You understand?
I'm gonna go back to sleep...
...and when I wake up,
everything is gonna be just the way it was.
Thank you.
You know what this means, right?
I'm ready.
HOBBES: Hey, Jonesy, how you doing?
JONESY: Look, I'm worried,
What you gonna do?
Where are you gonna go?
I'm going nowhere. I'm, uh...
I'm taking a long drive...
...where nobody will find me...
JONESY:
Hobbes, I gotta ask you something.
Yeah, shoot.
JONESY:
We've been partners a long time.
HOBBES:
Twelve plus, Jonesy. Twelve plus.
JONESY: So, uh,
was there anything you gotta tell me?
HOBBES: Yeah, remember what
we were talking about the other night?
When the moment comes, you know it.
JONESY:
Be careful, okay?
see you, partner.
HOBBES: Yeah, you too
Be good.
HOBBES: You're probably wondering
What am I doing?
Well, this is where things get
a little tricky.
I thought I had him.
But he thought he had me too.
HOBBES:
Come on out. I know you're here.
I knew you'd come.
Haven't you done enough, huh?
You made me kill an innocent man.
You murdered my brother.
Come on out, you son of a bitch!
How much more fun can you have, huh?
STANTON:
Jesus, Hobbes.
What are you talking about?
I didn't do any of that.
Me, I'm the poor schmo
they sent up here to bring you in.
So it's you now, huh?
It's me. Who'd you expect it to be?
Now drop your gun, Hobbes.
I know you got one.
Or what? You'll shoot me?
Where is the fun in that, huh?
Fuck you, huh?
You're making me do this.
Now, drop the goddamn gun.
JONESY:
Do what he says, Hobbes.
Jonesy.
So who else is out here, huh?
Lou? Tiff? Come on out!
No, it's just the two of us.
The gun, Hobbes.
Jonesy, you know I didn't do this.
You know I didn't do any of it.
I know that, Hobbes.
We both wanna believe you, Hobbes,
but we gotta bring you in.
Stan.
I don't know if I can do this.
What the fuck you talking?
Say Hobbes disappears into the woods,
we drive his car into the lake.
End of story. What's wrong with that?
We bring the son of a bitch in.
That's why we're up here.
He did it, fine.
He didn't do it, even better.
But it's not our job to decide.
Now drop the goddamn gun.
Jonesy?
Put the goddamn gun down.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
- I'm sorry, Stan.
- Oh, yeah.
Been on the force so many years, you think
you've seen it all, but you haven't.
- Life always gives you one more surprise.
- One more.
Sometimes it's a big one.
- Azazel.
- Hey, I'm your partner, man.
Go on, you're free. Run.
Keep thinking, Hobbes.
How about that, huh?
Jonesy's fucked. He just killed his boss.
Jonesy's fucked. You're fucked.
One at a time, huh?
That's how we do it. One by one.
Olly olly oxen free.
Time is on my side
You like the Stones, Hobbes?
I bet you didn't,
you big Monkee-fan pussy.
Time's up.
See the deal?
If I kill you
...it's just the final pathetic chapter...
...in the life of a disgraced hero.
Just one more piece-of-shit human scum.
But turn it around.
If I die...
...I enter you...
...put 20 more murders on your tab...
...before you go down.
Maybe your nephew
or that chippy you were talking to.
How you wanna do this, huh?
I die, you die?
What's maximum fun, huh?
Can you guess...
...what maximum fun is?
Sure you can.
Now that I've played you
from the outside...
...maximum fun is...
...I become you.
Oh, you got me, Hobbes.
You got me good.
But I gotta ask you something.
You wouldn't let me kill myself.
Why is that?
Because I need more time.
Time for what, asshole?
Five hundred cubits.
That's a long way, Azazel.
If Jonesy dies too fast,
as powerful as you are...
...I might never get away from you.
Oh, he's catching on.
What? You think you're gonna win
this thing?
God willing.
You never know.
Let me ask you something.
Why do you think...
...Milano came all the way out here...
...in the middle of nowhere?
To die, the little chickenshit.
I don't think so.
I think that he wanted to do
what I'm gonna do.
- Only he couldn't pull it off.
- Pull what off?
Oh, come on, Azazel.
Open your eyes, huh?
Look around sometime.
Here we are in this beautiful place...
...not another human being
around for miles.
It's just you and me.
What is this? You don't smoke any more.
That's right. I don't.
You know why?
Because cigarettes kill.
Especially cigarettes laced with poison.
Bullshit.
Same poison that you used
to kill my brother.
Fuck you.
It's beautiful, isn't it'?
Isn't it so sweet?
We die together, just you and me.
Time is on my side
Fuck you, motherfucker!
I'm sorry, Jonesy.
I'm sorry.
HOBBES:
So like I said at the start...
Can you imagine what it feels like
to be alive for thousands of years...
...and realize
you're actually going to die...
because some self-righteous cop decided
he was going to save the fucking world?
...and Hobbes figured out
how to beat me at my own game.
At the beginning I said
I was going to tell you...
