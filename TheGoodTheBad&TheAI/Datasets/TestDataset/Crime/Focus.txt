This year the team McEwen
is the only thing that gets me.
That's why I need you.
This requires discretion,
be safe, without errors.
I'll go through a disgruntled engineer
appearance.
Sell Offering EXR McEwen.
What we give you is a fake,
actually does nothing.
Only
will give a false reading their instruments.
Enough to fool the pilot
will have a slight increase.
One third of a second
few laps, imperceptible.
Just because
technicians say it works, what makes you think
you can convince them that you are absolutely real?
That you're completely authentic.
You can not be fooling around here, boy.
No need to worry about me.
I am extremely well prepared.
Proceed as planned,
tearing at the party tonight.
Good.
'll Be seen drinking and screaming and discontent.
I will approach him in full view of McEwen.
'll Start to argue, you
throw my drink. I shove...
- If it's okay for you.
- Okay.
Would be very surprised that
McEwen has not approached me there,
but if it does I
I will contact him.
Good.
Whatever
willing to pay me, I will stay at 100%.
- With a limit of one million you.
- Do we have a deal?
- Yes, Mr. Garriga. No deal.
- That's cool.
- I appreciate your time.
- Thank You.
I'll see you tonight.
- Do not say I did not warn you.
- Drama.
I'm excited.
I'm here for work.
- Do you speak English?
- Yes, of course.
- Yes, but speaks good Spanish.
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes...
- Thanks.
Okay.
Look, I'm here this
night on business.
I am a recovering alcoholic.
So when you ask for a Vodka Martini
ice...
If you can bring me water
olives, that would be fantastic.
Great choice, sir.
- Sabia.
- Thank You.
The point is that I do not even drink.
That man has me drinking again.
Okay.
- Vodka Martini with ice.
- On the rocks.
I wonder if Garriga in Spanish means thief.
My God, why

Who put a sofa
full of women among the party?
Hey, where are people of color is
?
There, there...
This man is a thief
I guess you can do what you want
when you're rich, idiot
You should drink less.
No, honey.
I have the right to speak, this is a free country.
- Buenos Aires is a free country, right?
- Buenos Aires is a city.
Okay, sorry.

Are you drunk?
Mr. Garriga

Me neither.
What part of your plan included
Appletinis be drinking?
Are you in a fraternity?
As I review the plan again a little.
Damn Prima donna, I do not think that garbage
delicate science.
Not supposed to complicate,
friend. This is not science.
Just do what you paid

Hey, Garriga!
Do not worry.
It's just a drunk engineer.
I think you have something to say.
Shit.
- Why did you hit?
- Robbed Me! Nobody steals from me!
- I'm an engineer discontent.

- What was that?
- Business complicated, honey.

- Of course I do.
The city is full of them.
Can we return to the

A little flat above

What is small for each

Is that my fault?
Please do not.

Hello.
Do you still asleep?
I thought you had a meeting with McEwen.
The'll,

There is some softness and laziness in your generation
,
makes me feel uncomfortable.
I like to be more active.
I will rest when you have cancer.
O when having sex.
Both are part of my
story, in case you are wondering you.
Actually no, do not ask me, but thanks for sharing
.
Sarcasm, another
evil of your generation.
If you want to tell someone to go to hell
, you would say.
Do not tell: Heaven, you have a
great jacket! Is weak.
- This is a messy bed.
- Yeah, I do not sleep well.
- Does anyone here, son?
- Who you calling "son"?
- You know why you do not sleep well? .
- No, tell me
For your iphone, your phone
intelligent, laptops and computers.
All
only produce a huge amount of useless information.
Cursed Twiter.
As if anyone really cared
they are eating
One sandwish turkey.
Sorry.
"Sandwich."
- Sarcasm?
- Satire.
- Cursed sandwich!
- Watch...
Are we done?
You maybe. Who did you go to the airport to pick
?
- Garriga commanded you follow me?
- I have my sources
- A computer expert.
- Why? Problem
Now that you're here,

Okay.
Look, there's no reason anyone

And start

I promise to make you look tall and most handsome

With friends like you, who needs luck

On a winter day in the rain
# White bird in a gilded cage
only
# The leaves blow across the long, black
way
# A heaven
dark, in his fury
# But only
white bird sits in its cage, unknown
# The white bird must fly

I really you think as amateur as
not have someone with McEwen?
Someone to watch over you?
be very cautious.
He's my secret weapon.
Now, imagine my surprise when Gordon
showed me what you sold
McEwen.
Not a fake software such as
agreed, but my plan, my design.
True
EXR stolen from my servers! That you stole!
Why?
I bought McEwen three million euros...
But these bags there are 27 million!
What it means is that you sold
everyone!
This is my reputation!
It's my reputation!
Made me look like a beginner.
That's what you get when you hire a scammer
.
- Piece of living crap.
- How did you get the information?
- And what she had to do with it?
- Nothing. Okay, listen.
- Tell me!
- Hey!
Tell me!
Leave her alone! I'll tell you!
I am a man.
Cracking your encryption.
He found a back door and entered your server.
It was very simple.
I think you should fire your computer.
No, no.
Put my user name and password.
The program generates all possible combinations.
Lie!
This generates a new password every 15 minutes.
And never lose sight.
- How do you get it?
- Who cares? It is done.
Okay.
Tell me.
- I want to know how!
- Leave her alone!
- How, how, how?
- Leave her alone!
- How?
- It was her. Was she right?
Was it.
Was it.
But I did not.
I knew nothing.
Good.
Your security was good.
It was better than I expected.
thought you could break the encryption but I could .
Then I saw Jess at your party.
Once
knew they were together, I knew it was my entry.
So I used it.
And I've been using.
There is a science to
people trust you.
With women
all about emotion, connection
That feel the emotion as strong as them
Dream of that nonsense
since they are girls.
With it, I used our history
A friendly face, cleared of
balance and stopped assaulting
I started
you emotionally closer to it
already disarmed, was now open
know you have someone when
begins to imitate unconsciously.
Nodding,
the hand gestures
means that are in sync
Sociologists call it.
"The reaction de Gauche. "
And then comes the knockout
Les
say how much you have changed...
I am different, Jess.
How to change your worldview.
Then shut with a talisman, a gift that says
.
has always been in my thoughts
The necklace had a
detector wireless keyboard.
All I needed was
to come into your room .
That issue was not important.
And when did that,
I had what I needed.
I'm not interested, really
.
Steal
enter your password and to your computer as if it were you.
Y unload all respect to the EXR.
Sorry.
But it was not his fault.
She had no idea.
It was deceived.
Why do not you let it go?
You and I can do everything
how fucked you need to do.
- This guy lost his mind.
- What is grace?
- All garbage.
- What's so funny?
More lies.
- What the fuck is so funny?
- What's so funny?
Garriga not my boyfriend.
- What?
- I barely know.
- It's just a whore career.
- What is a whore career?
- But I saw you...
- No, you saw what I wanted you to see.
You taught me that, remember?
's Been going crazy.
Hang out, flirt, flirts.
But at the moment
I want to upload it to my room...
I have a headache.
Cramps.
Ando in my days.
Look crime scene.
But I have scrabble.
Headache.
Your menstruation, right?
Long Menstruation over the world!

- Do Not!
- He was the one who did it.
- She was stealing.
I discovered making charges to the credit card Garriga
- and gave me a fright.
- That's fucking awesome.
You did all that for me jealous?
No, that was a part of
revenge for New Orleans, but...
- Yes, to make you jealous.
- I can not believe you lied to me.
- Can not believe that lie?
- I can not believe it.
- Can not believe it?
- I do not think so.
- Because you that's classic, classic.
- Is that what you mean me?
- Yes! Everything is working, everything.
- Are you sure?
- For trying to save your life.
- Lying!
Because they always lie, Nicky!
Do not know when you tell the truth!
Now we're dead!
Shit!
You're right.

This is the issue with
lies. This is the problem...
You fuck options.
- It puts you in a corner.
- What the fuck you talking about? Are you crazy?
And you're forced to do something really stupid
.
You want to die?
If I die, I will

If I lie wanna do like normal people lie.
If my wife asks me, "Hey
darling, do I look fat in these jeans
I mean?" No,
love, beautiful lights "
" You should wear them. ".
This is how
want to lie.
But this...
If dead...
'll tell the truth.
Well, Mr. Garriga,
I will tell the truth.
And you would not like at all.
A year ago I picked up the phone...
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Nicky!
I could not stand another fucking word.
- You're next, sweetheart.
- No, are you crazy?
- Nicky.
- What the hell thought?

You died with lies,

- I do not like you to call me mellow.
- Are you his father?
Is absurd at all possible terms.
By the way, I'm Bucky.
I like you, baby you're rude.
There. I tell you something, steals a car while I am
money.
Can not steal a car.
I was working for that kind for three years.
He was a man with
McEwen and did not tell me.
What the fuck happened to trust?
Did we get?
Risked my ass for that crap EXR.
And then came the girl.
- Do not be so stupid.
- So you talk to your father?
You're not my father abandoned me
.
I took you off the streets.
I taught my business and my passion.
Three generations of experience.
And despite all my efforts
, and my hard work,
you become a good
person. Well, I just... you know.
And I left you in the street
a damn good reason.
Because it was soft.
That just shows what
know, you son of a bitch.
We had a very good thing.
And then one day...
Seven years later in a poker game
Boston,
one guy pulled a gun.
A damn gun, a Glock.
It was the first time I saw one.
I just froze me.
And all I could think about was
that child.
I left and never looked back.
Love can kill you in this business.
There is no place for that here.
There is no happiness in that.
Have you heard that saying: "There
honor among thieves."
Well you're not a thief, mellow.
Took your decision.
So I'll take the money.
All.
- Well, that explains a lot.
- Yes, that's dad.
- No!
- Yup!
- No!
- Yup!
Shit.
See you at Christmas.
One, Two, Three...
Well, okay.
Well, almost there.
What shall we do now?
'll Be fine.
How?
Trust me.
Okay.
