Captain?
What?
I congratulate you, Major!
It was a real threat to the world,
but you took care of it.
Soon they will restore it
or will invent something else.
Of course... of course...
However, for this reason we exist.
At least this time they made sure that not
everything that man creates is good for them.
It seems that today we were able to convince
the Americans to take the right decision.
Yes.
I'd like to... believe in it.
