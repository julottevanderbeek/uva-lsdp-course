Avici Hell. Also known as Continuous Hell
Uninterrupted time
Unlimited space. Boundless suffering
for the fallen souls
Uninterrupted time
l still remember my first arrest
Year: 1991
lt was December 12, 1980
My partner and l were patrolling Hano Road
Shit was going down at New World Centre
We rushed over
A gang fight was taking place
About fifteen or so were already down
Lots of blood on the ground
Plus a several hands, still holding a knife
My partner told me to draw my piece
l was a rookie so l did what he told
But before l could open the holster
My partner already dropped
This kid stabbed a pipe into his belly
Blood gushed out of the sawed off opening
l didn't know what to think
l simply put all six of my bullets
straight into that kid!
l don't remember how many years he got
But when l saw him again two years ago
he was boozing in a club, looking sharp
His buddies were all Kwun's goons!
Evil prevails. Only the good die young!
l can barely recall my partner's face now.
l regret...
...the six bullets weren't put into
that kid's skull.
The world shouldn't be like this.
lt's not the way to be, Sam.
How long have you been around
Tsim Sha Tsui?
Almost two years now
Do you know why l haven't messed
with you?
'Cause l am handsome!
Maybe so
'Cause l think you're a decent guy.
l'd rather you be in charge.
Forget about it !
You couldn't waste the kid even
with six bullets.
That makes you a decent guy, too. Right?
l don't want to be one.
Kwun gave me everything, even my life.
lf l turned against him
l'd be despicable even in your eyes. Right?
l knew you'd say that.
Chivalry means little to the Ngai Family
The Master often says
"Retribution knows its time"
Who knows how you and l will end up?
Time to work!
This early?
l've got to eat! So do my boys!
Take the whole box
That's okay. Keep it !
Don't worry about it! Just go!
Want to use the back door?
Ain't no rules against schmoozing
with cops.
The front door's fine. Got used to it
Prat Avenue !
Prat Avenue !
ls Uncle Kwun in?
Uncle Kwun! Someone's looking for you!
Bye, Mary.
They say this American antique's got...
...sweet high, crisp middle and strong bass
Bullshit!
Who can afford it in Hong Kong?
Sit.
Only around ten thousand people can
afford it
Sam asked you to be a mole in the force.
lf you don't like it, l can talk to him
You're my boy after all.
lt's fine with me
Sure?
Positive.
Hand me that bag.
Mary
l thought you'd been dreading it
Hide in Tuen Mun till things quiet down
Stay fit for the Academy's new term
The money l gave you, spend it wisely.
You like the song?
Yeah
lt's yours.
lt won't sound as good on another player
Someday l'll pick out a good one for you
What? Don't like it?
Not at all
Sam gave you this watch, didn't he?
None of your business
Only you and l...
...know about tonight
l don't want Sam to know
Why's that?
Women are simple
A man treats me well, l'd do anything.
Now go home. l'm very busy tonight.
lt's either you or me
The boss said l would see blood today
The Mainlander kept asking ...
Got a Mercedes today, Keung?
l said, ''Of course.'' And here l am!
Otherwise, l wouldn't be here with you
Mainland girls in arms
That's for sure!
Hey, got a cigarette?
l don't smoke
Let's forget about it. My car's fine
See! She says it's all good
Dressed all dandy
Don't want any trouble, do you?
Look at me. All beaten up by you.
Who do you think the judge would believe?
l bet you guys never go to
Tsim Sha Tsui East, huh?
Know who l am? l'm Keung !
Sam's top dog . Del Piero's boy
l'll kick your ass every time l see you
And you can count on that
How about calling an ambulance, sir?
Look at all the blood!
Have them bring 500 cc Type O. lt's rare!
Shut up!
Wait till we're back to the station
Why do l have to go to the station?
l only stole a piece of junk, sir!
What've l done to deserve the OCTB?
Just shut up!
Does that deserve an OCTB beating?
Don't you know you're just a cadet?
And you are expected to get a medal
this year.
Don't ever let Yip know about this!
Happy birthday!
What's there to be happy about?
Ten years in the Academy. A rustic hell !
You even managed to get me out
Your case's now ancient history
Get yourself out
So what if the Commissioner's Chinese
now?
Still six more years till the hand over
l'll be 48 by then!
Might as well train a few good cops here!
The world is yours after 1997!
Yan
Been beeping the whole day
How come you don't call back?
Girlfriend?
Cheers, sir! Cheers!
Just leave me alone!
lt's none of my business
l don't want to know a thing
Go! Leave me alone!
Law
What do you want?
My father just passed way
lt was his wish to inform his children...
when something bad happened to him!
Sorry to have bothered you!
Stop watching TV! Eat first, Negro!
l wonder what they have on Kwun's death
Did you do it, Ching?
l've got a big mouth. Had l done it...
...you would've heard about it!
Ask Wah and Gandhi
When Kwun died, l was in Macau
Everybody knows!
But l bet his kids think l did it
l ain't scared of nothing
The eldest son's a doctor
The youngest a brat
The daughter's married for ages
Only the middle son's running the show
lf they go too far, l'll show them!
We failed to protect Kwun. lt's our fault!
That's enough, Uncle John !
Dad used to say
What goes around comes around
lt came later than expected already
Wah, Ching, Negro and Gandhi
Guess what those four are thinking?
Thank you. Thank you all!
How's mom doing, sis?
She's fine. Been sleeping
Bring some cigs to the morgue for dad
l'll go get them
B Team, watch Tak Shing Street
C Team, watch the Austin Road exit...
...of that financial building
lt has two exits
One on Tak Shing Street. One on Austin...
Sorry
Hello?
Something this big, why didn't you call?
l called everybody the minute it happened!
Kwun's boys can't sit still for sure
Shit will hit the fan tonight!
lt's the 14th already. You know that?
The 14th. Time to pay the Ngai Family
l'm the youngest here
So let me be the jackass
l'm not paying the Ngai's any more
What do you three think?
lnspector Wong
What's up?
What're your men doing outside
Wah's building?
Not a good day for chit chat
Are you into something?
Fine, fine. Next time
What's the occasion?
Come on. Where's my seat?
Only if you're here for the food
All other businesses have to wait
The food. lt's all about the food
Tonight's gonna be the shit!
Let the Big Four do their things
We'll deal with the aftermath
Don't let them start fighting
Or you'll see bodies
What? Not satisfied?
You know the rule. Pick a card
Okay. Higher points win
Come on!
There's nothing left to talk about
What's up, Hau?
Wah
Nothing much
Heard you're planning a casino in Macau
l've got the government in my pocket
How about a joint venture?
Uncle Kwun's dead
l'm not in the mood
l see
The Macau trip wasn't all business
l know you had fun with Gandhi's wife
Sorry, but l can't let go of my casino
in Macau
Gotta go
What are Sam's people doing?
l know Wah paid up
Don't change the subject
Tell me something l don't know!
Call me when you get your shit straight!
Hau took care of Wah in ten minutes
The Big Four are having a tough time
Hau took out a million's worth of coke
What?
Mafia road block or what?
l don't know why Wah paid up, Hau
But l ain't gonna negotiate
l don't plan to negotiate, either
Pass the phone to Negro
Hey, Negro
Don't know why he calls you from my hood
What's up, Hau?
l'm with Gandhi all the way
He's not paying, neither will l!
Heard you and Gandhi have been tight
The heroin you two smuggled got robbed
Lost several millions each, right?
Luckily l found the stuff in your warehouse
Want me to hand it back to Gandhi now?
What's he talking about?
Among the Tsim Sha Tsui Big Fives...
Wah and Negro paid up
Counting Sam, that's 3 to 2
l'm the youngest here. Gotta pay!
See ya!
Don't think too much. Cheers!
Pay my share for me!
Mr. Ngai went to eat, lnspector Wong
A bit late for chowing, don't you think?
My dad always came here after work
l have to keep up the ritual
Want to join us?
lt's your seat from now on. Must be tough
Not at all
You guys worked all night for nothing
Now that's tough
Well done, Hau
Hope you can keep it up
Don't let it turn into a tragedy. Let's go
What did you say?
We want to celebrate
Kwun's dead
Time to pop the champagne
Want me to pop one for you?
What?
Want to mess with cops?
Officers!
The Ngai's are in mourning
What more do you want?
Let's go
Sam
Dad used to operate street gambling here
Started out as...
a dime and nickel business
Now who doesn't know his name?
He often said
What goes around comes around
And now he's...
l'll always remember this day
lt's all good, honey. Want some snacks?
Good to hear that. Just come home
An officer has to have a clean background
Though you cut your ties with the Ngai's...
...you still share the same father with Hau
That means you lied on your application
l have but to let you go
But before you leave...
...go see ''Mr. Wrong Socks'' first
Still want to be a cop?
Can l still?
Only if you can give me a good reason
l want to be a righteous person
lf you want to be a cop...
...then lend me a hand. Simple as that
You pick me 'cause l'm Hau's brother,
right?
When the time comes,
will you arrest him yourself?
How do l start?
Brace
You okay?
Hanging in there?
What's wrong?
Does it still hurt?
My dad passed away today
He was so good to me
l asked the officer...
...if l could go to his funeral
The officer said...
Know what it means to be a prisoner?
lt means you're not allowed
even to attend your father's funeral
Don't you know that?
Get out of here!
Come on. Stop that
Year: 1 995
Are you nuts?
You sent Yan to be a mole?
Don't you know Hau's his half brother?
So what?
Bring me his file!
So you're playing the boss now, huh?
You damn well know you the files
are classified
l treat you like a bro. ls this what l get?
lf you're a real bro, stop asking !
lt's okay
Calm down!
Speak slowly!
She had an abortion!
lt's no big deal. Just a baby
You can always have another one
l've been with you for four years
And l've bailed you out tons of times
One minute we're dining with my folks...
...the next you'll be in a gang fight
l don't want our baby to grow up like you
Do you understand?
Why so uptight?
No, nothing
Uncle John says you're doing well
Ever thought about helping the family out?
l know you want to keep a distance
from the Ngai's
But we're blood brothers. lt's a fact
lt's my daughter's birthday this Sunday
You're invited
You really hate talking to me, huh?
No
Promoted already?
Soon you'll be a superintendent
Might as well become a full time cop
Sam's kidding . Go ahead,
give me a smile
Thanks for your intel these couple years
When you were still a rookie...
l helped you catch some small potatoes
lt's about time you caught some big shots
How about catching me?
Why so dirty? Or you can catch
this hot chicks
What're you doing?!
What a hot hootchie mama!
Your man must be
one good looking bastard
lt's you! Who else?
Gotta go
Gotta go meet Mr. Ngai
Sam's so good to you!
But he's not good to himself
lt's been four years
He could be in charge now
But he gave everything to the Ngai's
Already?
Now the Ngai Family's all big and bad
Hau must've figured it out
For the past four years
l haven't been sleeping well
l'm lnspector Wong Chi Shing
Don't worry, Mary
l won't let anything happen to you
Words, words, words
l promise
Toss it up!
Two days ago, a real estate agent came
Guess how much he offered?
One hundred sixty million!
What's wrong with Hong Kong? Tell me!
When my dad bought it
it was 9 million...280 thousand
What a world!
Moving, Mr. Ngai?
No big deal
Communication's easy these days
We're just a phone call away
l'm just worried about the phone bill
The phone company's greedy, you know
l've discussed it with mom
Our businesses are on the right track
You guys helped out so much in the past
l don't want to be ungrateful
l want to split the business up...
...among you guys
Treat it as a gift or a retirement fund
Let's eat! Take whatever you want!
We should hang out like this more often
Mr. Ngai
Are you leaving for real?
After you're gone, hell will break loose!
You're a Buddhist, aren't you, Sam?
Easy to start. Hard to let go
l'm letting go. Be happy for me
l've thought about it
Cocaine will be the future
Those four ship it in small bags
from S. America
Small timers!
l've closed a deal with the Thais
You'll have the monopoly
You'll be the top dog . Leader of the pack
Go to Thailand and wrap up the logistics
You plan to get rid of those four?
Move closer to the right, please
Yan
Come join the family portrait
Stand next to me!
l haven't been around much
these two years
lt's rare to spend time...
...with the whole family like this
Your siblings are in legit businesses
lt's time you helped out the family
Everything dad did was for the family
l did the same
Hope you will, too
A deal's coming up next week
Come with me
l'll call you
l think he's taking the deal seriously
He'll go in person next Wednesday
The 1 4th... Kwun's memorial
Hau wants to whack the Big Four
Why does he send Sam away?
Don't know. Sam should be of help to him!
Unless he wants to kill Sam also!
l've been following you around for days!
l'm your superior after all
l want to know what your plan is
The Ngai's are your family
Do you really know what you're doing?
l'm a cop!
Good
Give me a salute
l've booked a table. Care for dinner?
Do l look good in my cap?
Looking good?
What'll you do in Thailand in that outfit?
Have some shark fin
A massage. Get two whores
for a threesome
That's for sure
Honey!
What?
Why didn't you tell me about your trip?
lt's a business trip! Not for fun!
Don't worry. l'll behave
Hau plans to whack Wah and those guys
l know
But do you know you're his target too?
Nonsense! How can that be?
Just wait for me at the airport!
Time to board, Sam!
That's all l can do for now
Call Sam again when the plane lands
l'm going to kill Hau tonight
Don't do anything rash!
l'm not being rash!
Four years ago...
...you told me to kill Kwun
So what? Want to blackmail me now?
l'm not blackmailing you
We simply passed the point of no return!
l'll send everybody away
Tonight's operation's top secret
We're divided into three teams
Team A watches here
Team B here
Wait for my order before doing anything
Team C follows the target until...
Nobody told me about the date change!
You know Hau changes his mind
all the time
You think Yan's the only mole?
My man's been undercover
for seven years!
Where's the deck of cards?
We'll run the show together tonight
Let's go!
Sir
How are you?
Hau
Zipping it till your lawyer gets here?
Come on, cooperate with us!
ln fact, l appreciate your cooperation
Are you speaking Zen, Mr. Ngai?
l don't get it
Dad used to say...
... the way things work in the streets...
... what goes around always comes around
He died four years ago. lt's about time
The stove's hot enough now
She's here, boss
You're here now
What can you swing?
Wait and see
Got it! Sir
The two foreigners are private eyes
Honey! Where are you?
Thailand, of course
Come back right away!
Are you nuts? Why should l come back?
Don't ask questions! Just come back!
Hau wants you dead!
Nonsense! l'm working for him
as we speak!
Listen to me!
l killed Kwun!
You've got a VCR?
lsn't it good?
What an awesome show!
Take care. Run if you have to
What did Hau say?
Sam. Sunny!
Mr. Ngai told me to take good care of you!
Four years ago...
...you told me to kill Kwun
So what? Want to blackmail me now?
l'm not blackmailing you
We simply passed the point of no return!
l'll send everybody away
l hired Alan and Johnson...
...to investigate my father's murder
Who would've known?
The police conspired...
to murder my father
A law abiding citizen
SP Luk
lsn't that an officer in the video?
Whether to nail him or not...
...that's up to you
What a good show!
You're so friggin' photogenic
Four years ago...
How much did Sam's woman pay you?
Give me another chance, Mr. Ngai
l gave them a chance four years ago
They didn't take it
lf l give you a chance
Are you going to take it today?
You've been with us for seven years now
You're a cop
We're the bad guys
Time to accept our fates
You can't blame me
Your lnspector Wong killed my dad
