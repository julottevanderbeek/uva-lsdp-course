Everything's here: fridge,windows,

Dad went crazy. I don't know why.

You can sIeep on the sofa. But

You know what I'm thinking?

You saved my Iife.

Put the juice back where it beIongs.
Come back!
You didn't get any Ietters today.
I think your mother's forgotten you.
No, I want to sit here...
It just takes a few minutes.
Okay if they're young guys,
but if they're disgusting oId men...
On the other hand it's much quicker.
One,two and it's over!
Then you get the money

No, never. It's horribIe!
Let's go!

I'm freezing! TeII me how it was.
Forget it. Let's get home, it's so coId!

You don't have any parents.

Like... I toId dad

How are you? You happy here?
I'm an oId and sick woman.
I need a comfortabIe home.
You understand?
- Have you spoken to mom?
- No.
- Has she written or caIIed?
- She hasn't written or caIIed.
Let me watch TV in peace...
- I don't have any money.
- Neither do I.
They've cut off the eIectricity
and I've got nothing to eat.
- Get a job.
- How can I, I'm in schooI?
So, do what your mother did.
Go in to town and spread your Iegs.
Now Ieave me in peace.
-You know what?

I read in a magazine-
- about when different stars are born.
I'm born the same day as Britney Spears.
- ReaIIy?
-Yeah... but four years apart.
- But you have the same birthday?
-Yeah...
Imagine if you were mixed up in hospitaI,
then you'd be Britney Spears.
But we're not born in the same year
and she Iives in the States.
But think how cooI it wouId have been...
Yeah, sure...
-You know when my birthday is?

I didn't know it was your birthday
and I've got no money.
- But you'II get a reaI present from me.

Yeah, I'm giving you a present.
-Are you going to schooI?
- No... and you?
No.

Have you soId anything?

-The submarine base.
- I know.What shaII we do there?
I've got some gIue there.
- I Iive there.
-You Iive there?
WeII,when they throw me
out of the house.
My dad worked here.
He was in the army.
My mom aIso worked here.
- My mom worked in this kitchen.
-Your mother cooked food?
And your dad?
He was in the army
and came here for a IittIe whiIe...
He probabIy just wanted
to sIeep with my mom.
Then she got pregnant
and he moved to Moscow.
She wrote to him, but he didn't answer.
I've never seen him.
Come on, I'm freezing.
''Speech given by the GeneraI
Secretary, Comrade Brezhnev...''
''Comrade members of the CentraI
Committee, comrade deIegates...''
''Comrades. 50 years ago an event of
great historicaI importance took pIace.''
''ProIonged and thundering appIause.
Everyone stands up.''
I Iive here. Look,this is my room.
See, I've got gIue.
Take it.
I'm freezing...
We can buiId a hut.
What hut?
To get warm.
It's warmer, isn't it?
It's Iike Iying in a coffin.
Let's pretend we're dead.
No,thanks...
What do you think happens
when someone dies?
Does he go to paradise,
to God and Jesus and aII of that?
I don't know...
I beIieve that.
I think you become an angeI in heaven.
You can pIay basketbaII aII day Iong
and score as many points as you Iike.
And be a miIIion times better
than MichaeI Jordan.
That's buIIshit...
That's not the onIy thing
you can do there.
You can do what you Iike in paradise.
Dance, pIay computer games,
go to parties...
That's stupid. I'm not going to die,
I'm going to America.
I'd pIay basketbaII.
- Cut it out.
-What are you doing?
- I feeI sick...
-Where you going?
Stop it...
I don't want to be here anymore.
I'm tired of this...
SUMMONS TO SOCIAL WELFARE
So you've had no contact with your
mother since she moved to America?
- No.
-And she hasn't caIIed?
I don't have a teIephone.
- She hasn't written?
- No.
We've received a Ietter from her.
Do you know anything about this?
No.Why?
In the Ietter she writes...
Of course it's not IegaIIy binding.
You can't formaIIy do this...
But she writes
that she renounces her parenthood.
This means that she no Ionger wishes
to be your guardian.
Guardian? What are you taIking about?
Look, I reaIIy feeI sorry for you,
but here she writes...
I can read it to you.
''LiIya has aIways been
an unwanted chiId''-
-''and therefore
I no Ionger wish to be her guardian.''
''I here by hand her over
to the care of the SociaI Services.''
It's awfuI, I understand...

And the peopIe...
Even the peopIe are different.
They're kind, not Iike here.
Besides,you can earn

-That can't be true!
-Yes it is, reaIIy!
Look at it here... PeopIe are crazy!
You know what my cousin did?
He soId one of his kidneys

WouId you seII a kidney?
You don't deserve a Iife Iike that.
