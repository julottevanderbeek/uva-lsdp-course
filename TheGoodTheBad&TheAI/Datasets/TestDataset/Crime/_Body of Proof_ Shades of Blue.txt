Oh, my God!
Are you crazy? I could've killed you.
Get the hell outta here!
What the...
Brought you some coffee.
I figured I wasn't the only one
who could use it.
Well, thank you, partner.
Well, at least we didn't dress alike.
Well, I thought about that,
but plum doesn't really work for me.
Mm-hmm.
Where's Bud?
Oh, he's running behind.
Jeannie's having a bad case
of morning sickness.
Just tell him to stay home.
It's just one dealer doing another.
And you know that why?
I'm guessing because we've
worked this area
a lot longer than you.
Ah. Actually, he's right.
No one comes down here
except for dealers and addicts.
Well, he certainly wasn't dumped here.
Any I.D.?
Uh, yeah. Driver's license.
Johnny Vasquez,
age 37, from Camden.
Did you see that sawdust on his boots?
Yeah, we're, uh, canvassing the area
for construction sites now.
Muzzle imprint, stellate laceration,
powder burns around the entry wound.
And we have a...
white gold charm
with the number 3 on it...
and a New York phone number.
Hard contact,
penetrating gunshot wound...
this was an execution.
The bullet fragmented upon impact.
That helps explain
the raccooning of the eyes.
Ballistics is gonna have
a field day with this one.
I have a small laceration
in the mid-knuckle...
of the right hand.
Looks inflamed.
Maybe he put up a fight.
Not last night.
That's a couple of days old.
Detective, no food or drink.
You know that.
How's Jeannie? Feeling better?
If by better you mean exhausted
and peeing all the time,
she's great.
Is she drinking a lot of fluids?
Orange juice, 2 gallons a day.
Weight gain?
You trying to get me killed?
Can we stick to the business at hand?
He has receding gums,
which suggests
- chronic drug abuse.
- Help me roll him.
He is a drug dealer.
That much we know.
Spent some time in prison.
Currently on parole.
There's some kind of white powder
on his posterior neck.
Looks like some hairs.
Hmm.
Three of 'em.
Well, since he's so...
follicularly challenged,
I would assume that the hairs
are from the killer, right?
Now let me guess.
You want me to run that to the lab,
put it through Codis, right?
Thank you.
I told you, detective.
How do you women do it?
How do we do what?
Survive pregnancy.
There are days that Jeannie would...
trade places with this guy.
Well, hopefully, she has a good partner.
So crime lab said that
the sawdust found on Vasquez's boots
is not natural.
It's compressed.
And that is interesting how?
You obviously don't
spend time in dive bars.
They use sawdust to clean up spilled beer.
I know at least two near the crime scene.
Excuse me. You know Johnny Vasquez?
Yeah, he's the bar manager.
He should be in around noon.
Afraid he won't be.
Johnny was murdered last night.
Oh, my God.
Look at me.
Your eyes are glassy,
your pupils are dilated.
You're high, aren't you?
No.
Was Johnny your dealer?
Jo... Johnny's really dead?
It hurts, I know.
Now you're gonna
have to find another one.
Johnny looked after me.
He was gonna introduce me to this guy
that he knew in the music business
to start my career.
Um, I sing, you know?
Sublimely, I'm sure.
Now who else was he supplying?
I... I don't know anything about that.
Yep, all right.
No, no, I tell you what,
why don't you give us the names
of everyone you know that
had dealings with Johnny,
and we won't arrest you?
Prison records show
that the wrist fracture
was from a fight nine months ago,
just before he got out.
Autopsy was unremarkable.
This guy was no drug addict.
Which is weird,
because prelim tox results
were positive for cannabis,
cocaine metabolites, and methadone.
Methadone to kick
a heroin habit he didn't have?
Check out this white powder on his neck.
It's a mixture
of magnesium oxide and cornstarch.
It's used in latex gloves
to prevent stickiness.
Gentlemen, we have a puzzle...
a drug dealer with drugs in his system
who didn't abuse drugs.
Look, I've been trying to get
ahold of his parole officer.
Maybe that'll shed some light.
Yeah.
Charlie.
The boy wonder.
How long has it been, huh?
It's been too long.
Look at you in your cushy office.
Yeah, well, you know...
You don't miss, uh,
mold and peeling paint?
Well, I don't miss being shot either.
Shoulda ducked, partner.
I told you that banger was our man.
So, uh...
you like it here?
You're stalling.
Did you call the parole office
about a Johnny Vasquez?
Megan, I don't believe
you know my old partner
from the police force.
This is Charlie Meeks.
Nice to meet you.
I wish I could say the same.
Charlie may know the victim.
We already have an I.D.
His name is Johnny Vasquez.
Johnny Vasquez was his cover name.
His real name is Eddie Castillo.
He was my partner.
He's a cop.
Body of Proof 2x12 - Shades of Blue

Okay, listen up.
Eddie Castillo was my partner.
No one's going home,
no texting your mother,
until we find whoever killed Eddie.
Medical Examiner's Office informs us
we're looking for somebody
with dark brown hair,
probably near the docklands.
Anything you need to nail
this guy, you got it.
Captain says so.
So come on.
Let's go. We're bringing this guy down!
Come on!
Your troops seem
a little hopped up out there.
Eddie was a good man, a good cop.
I think what she's trying to
say is, emotions are high.
You may want to remind your men
to follow procedure.
We know how to do our job.
How can I help you do yours?
Answer some questions.
I assume, as part of his cover,
that detective Castillo
had to take drugs?
Because we found several in his system.
He would do anything
to maintain his cover.
He even did a stint in prison
to build up his street cred.
What was Eddie investigating?
Someone was extorting the docklands.
They're using low-level drug dealers
to shake down bars, restaurants,
even high-level dealers.
Eddie set himself up as a mark.
Apparently, a little too well.
Ballistics is still working on the bullet.
It goes without saying,
this is our top priority.
Anything new on our end,
and you'll be the first to know.
Thank you.
So you get anywhere with that number?
It's just an answering machine,
but it does belong to a Ray Jones,
music producer.
Mm. So our poor torch singer
did have a fan.
Maybe.
Ah.
Lopez, that better not be my O.J.!
You got 4 gallons in there.
It is for the wife. Put it away.
Put it away.
- Jeez Louise. Greedy.
- Thank you.
A unit responded to a call
from The Wonderland Bar.
Seems like our torch singer
just tried to rob the place.
You're the ones who forced me
to dime out Johnny's contacts.
You think I'm gonna stick around?
But first a quick stop
to rob your employer.
See,
this is what we call a telling act.
You need money, you steal.
You need drugs...
You think I killed Johnny?
Well, I can't say it would shock us.
J... Johnny said he had
a friend in the music business
who would listen to my demo.
I didn't go in there to steal.
I just...
When I saw the money,
I... I thought it would help me
get outta here.
Start fresh, you know?
I... I couldn't help myself.
Mm.
I always knew this day would come.
It must have been very difficult,
living with the constant stress.
It was just the opposite.
It was the most liberating relationship
I've ever been in.
Nothing got swept under the rug.
We both knew that every day
together could be our last.
Did he ever talk about his work?
The undercover stuff? No.
Police gossip? I got an earful,
especially about Meeks.
With all his womanizing and drinking,
I always thought he'd be the one
to walk into a bullet.
Mrs. Castillo,
we're trying to sort out
which of our findings
are part of Eddie's cover
and which weren't.
Uh, we have some prison records
that say that he broke his wrist
in a prison fight.
Is that true?
No.
He broke it on our first trip together,
snowboarding in the Poconos.
The doctors put him in a cast,
and he was back out on the slopes...
to be with me.
We also found a white gold charm
in one of Eddie's pockets
with a number 3 on it.
My anniversary present.
We were supposed to have dinner,
but he never showed.
I think a part of me knew at that moment.
Can I have my anniversary present?
They're sending me to a hotel
for my protection.
I don't know how long
I'm gonna be there for.
And I... I... I'd really like to have it.
I'm very sorry.
It's still in police evidence.
But we'll get it to you
as soon as we can.
Okay.
Okay. Check this out.
There's an irregular fragment
of foreign material
in the knuckle laceration,
and it's not biological.
You know how your case ends, right?
Yeah, we catch a cop killer.
Mnh-mnh.
Unemployment.
For me?
For all of us.
A cop killer case?
This is a lose-lose situation.
One tiny thing goes wrong,
and whose heads are gon' roll?
Don't let anything go wrong.
Hmm. What about the hairs on the body?
You got anything yet?
Yeah, Codis matched it to
a Quentin Whitsett,
Okay.
Here's a thought,
next time you ID a cop killer,
lead with that.
Quentin Whitsett. That son of a bitch.
- I take it you know the man.
- Yeah.
What kind of history
you got with this guy?
I busted him for possession
six months ago.
He filed harassment charges.
That's why I don't want you
anywhere near him.
Captain...
he executed my partner.
There is no way I'm not going.
Okay, as backup.
S.W.A.T. has tactical command.
You take whoever you need,
but you bring him in.
I thought we'd already ID'd Whitsett.
We did, but hair is
a nutritional timeline
that shows relative health,
sickness, and drug use.
So?
Curtis, you still have those records up?
According to his parole records,
Whitsett wasn't doing drugs.
As of the last one three weeks ago,
he tested negative 25 times.
So how come his hair sample
tested positive
for chronic drug use?
Here's another question for you...
does it strike anyone else
as odd that all three hairs
are 1.5 inches in length?
That's the sample size
the crime lab uses.
I knew this case was trouble. I told you.
Wait a second. So you're saying that...
I'm saying that they're Whitsett's hairs,
but they had to have come
from police evidence
in a prior case.
And the last time
that Whitsett was busted was...
six months ago, arresting officer...
Charlie Meeks.
No way. You seriously think that
Charlie is framing Whitsett
for his partner's murder?
I think someone is,
and the police are about
to bust down Whitsett's door.
If one of them's behind this,
what do you think
the chances are
that Whitsett's gonna survive?
All right. Let's go.
Baker.
Have you got Whitsett yet?
They're about to take him down now.
- Call it off.
- What?
He's being framed. Call it off.
What's going on?
Peter says call of the bust.
We can't call it off.
They're about to take the door right now.
Whitsett's being framed by a cop.
Meeks.
Where is Meeks?
You're a dead man.
Put the gun down!
Put the gun down right now!
He killed my partner!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Shut up!
- Come on! Come on, Meeks!
- I didn't do anything!
- Shut up!
Come on, Meeks. Put it down, Meeks.
You're not walking away from this.
- Somebody get this guy off of me!
- Stand down!
No! This piece of trash killed Eddie.
We don't want to lose
another cop over this!
- Put the gun down!
- Don't shoot. Please.
Got a gun. Same caliber.
That's not my gun!
- Shut up!
- Please don't shoot. Please.
Detective Meeks, we  take you out.
I appreciate that you're upset.
Upset?
We're lucky no one got shot.
And where the hell do you get off
interrupting a tactical operation?
Hi. My idea.
Our evidence was compelling,
and as I understand it,
your tactical operation went to hell
when Meeks decided to play cowboy.
I put Meeks on leave.
But as for your compelling evidence...
every hair 1.5 inches
automatically came from our lab?
I don't think so.
The hair tested positive for cocaine.
And yet your own parole reports
have Whitsett clean as of three weeks ago.
He could've gotten
a haircut six months ago,
and the night of the murder,
put on the same hat or jacket.
Whatever.
Nothing you have said
exonerates this jerk.
Fresh sample might.
Mr. Whitsett, I would
not want to be you right now.
The police think you killed
an undercover cop.
Someone's setting me up.
I didn't kill anybody.
Your hair was found on the body,
and it tested positive for cocaine.
That can't be. I... I haven't
done drugs since I got busted.
Meeks... that son of a bitch.
He feels the same way about you.
He... he's trying to frame me.
I didn't kill no cop.
Then give me a hair sample.
Lady, you can take as many as you want.
Thank you. That'll do it.
So, Bud...
when am I gonna meet the wife?
I'm sorry?
Jeannie.
Bring her by the office tomorrow.
Why? What's wrong?
Is there something wrong?
Nothing's wrong. I just want to meet her.
What do you got?
Hey, you remember that
black foreign material
we found in the knuckle laceration?
It's gold.
What is gold doing in a knuckle wound?
Could be gold used
in restorative dentistry.
Wait, he hit a dentist?
No, fool. He hit somebody in
the mouth with a loose filling.
If there's native tooth in that sample,
we can get D.N.A.
Ed didn't fight off his attacker.
Well, then who'd he fight?
His partner.
You really think this is the right place
to get your head on straight?
I'm on leave.
No weapon, no danger to anyone.
Well, until you start swinging, like...
like Eddie swung at you recently.
Ahh.
How the hell'd you know about that?
Do you remember that filling
that I knocked out of your fat head
the first month working together?
We found a fragment of gold filling
embedded in Eddie's knuckle.
If they get any D.N.A. back
that matches you,
congratulations,
you're our prime suspect.
I wondered what happened to it.
Any chance I can get it back?
I will knock you out myself
if you don't start talking.
Exactly,
'cause that's what partners do.
Oh, come on.
They knock sense into
each other when they need it.
That's what I was trying to do.
Or is that what Eddie was doing,
knocking some sense into you?
I mean, you've always been
a hard charger, Charlie.
Are you into something
over your head or what?
You really think I had
something to do with this?
Eddie was supposed to check in with me
every couple of weeks.
He started blowing off meetings,
and I was scared for him.
I mean, he was really
burning the candle at both ends.
Thought he was taking too many risks
getting in with these people,
but he swore he was on to something.
And he wouldn't tell you what.
Yeah, well...
we were supposed to meet, but...
he got shot in the head.
Wait a second. Y... you were
in the area last night?
I was waiting in my car
about 5 miles away.
With no alibi for the shooting?
Well, how about my word?
Or does that not count with you anymore?
Ethan tied the gold filling
fragment to Meeks.
But since you already know that,
I'm just wondering why I
didn't hear about it from you.
I wanted to talk to my partner first.
I'm your partner.
He's your ex-partner.
And his partner is lying
in a refrigerated drawer.
- Charlie didn't kill him.
- Why?
Because he says so?
I spent six years
putting my life in his hands
on a daily basis,
so, yeah, because he says so.
- I know he didn't do it, Megan.
- No, you don't.
Get your emotions out of this.
If you go after Meeks, I can't
be with you on this one.
Okay? I'm sorry.
It's not about divided loyalties.
You work for me.
Not on this one.
I've noticed you have a knack
for rubbing people the wrong way.
And I've noticed that you
have got something wrong
with your department.
The gun is a match. I will give you that.
But don't you think it's odd
that the only evidence
that wasn't planted on Eddie's body
was the gold filling from his knuckle,
and that belongs to Meeks?
So now Meeks planted the gun too?
You said it yourself,
someone's extorting the docklands,
somebody that you can't
ID or get close to.
And you think it's Meeks?
Well, I've know the man for 15 years.
And he's many things,
but a dirty cop isn't one of 'em.
Okay, fine. Let me prove his story.
Let me examine the murder weapon.
Well, you were copied
on the crime lab report,
weren't you?
Oh.
I am asking you to take
the tiniest leap of imagination,
and all you want to do
is pin it on Whitsett.
Hmm. I'm beginning to wonder why.
Well, I'm beginning to wonder
what that guy said
when you were running
your fingers through his hair
that's making you want to
stick your neck out for him.
I didn't say he was a good guy.
I just said that you do not have enough.
Well, I don't agree,
and neither does the D.A.
Whitsett's being arraigned as we speak.
Fine.
Then I am recommending
mandatory drug tests
for the entire department.
What drug test?
This is a drug-related case.
An undercover officer posing
as a drug dealer was murdered.
Police evidence from a prior drug bust
was planted to frame a suspect.
So everyone of your people
agrees to be tested
or Internal Affairs will make them.
Hmm.
Please tell me you did not just threaten
an entire homicide squad
with mandatory drug testing.
They wouldn't let me see
the murder weapon.
You just alienated
the only people
who could make that happen.
Come on.
You don't think Internal Affairs
will take our side?
We don't have a side.
If you have to have the gun,
you send Peter.
I'm sure his standing over there
is a lot better than yours at the moment.
Peter and I are not...
quite seeing eye-to-eye on this one.
Peter.
Do I understand correctly,
you're refusing to work this case?
Would you do an autopsy on a friend?
I'd prefer not to.
Well, that's what you're
asking me to do to Meeks.
And if there were evidence
proving that he was innocent,
would you go after it?
Of course.
Good. Then go get the murder weapon
from the police so we can test it.
Test it to prove what...
that Meeks planted it?
Peter, I'm not asking.
You're either on our team or you're not.
And frankly, I'm okay with
whichever choice you make,
but you're gonna make it, now.
Dr. Megan Hunt,
this is my wife... Jeannie Morris.
I have heard so much about you.
Oh, really?
Don't worry. I've known
Buddy long enough to know
who he likes and who he doesn't,
even though he complains about both.
- I'm standing right here.
- Well, it is very nice to  meet you.
Please. Sit.
There's more?
Oh, relax.
We'll talk about you another time, Bud.
Jeannie, if it's all right with you,
I would like to give you a spot test
for your blood sugar level.
Uh, sure. Why?
Well, Bud has mentioned
some of the difficulties
that you've been having,
and I'm sure you're being monitored
by your own doctor.
But...
have you been tested
for gestational diabetes yet?
Um, it's scheduled for my next visit.
Put pressure on that.
Well, I didn't want to alarm Bud
or you unnecessarily...
but your level is high.
So... you need to make
that next visit tomorrow.
Review this later.
Peter Dunlop.
A fool's errand is beneath you.
And not cooperating is beneath you, sir.
Yeah. You know what I think?
I think you shouldn't have left the force.
You ever think about coming back,
I can make that happen.
No, thanks.
She must be something special,
this Dr. Hunt.
What do you mean?
Well, you can't be there for the work.
Staring at dead bodies all day isn't you.
Staring at her on the other hand...
now that I can understand.
What is it that you really want
to ask me, captain?
You want his gun?
Tell me about Megan Hunt.
As requested.
Thank you.
And you didn't have to send Kate.
I didn't.
But now that I know,
I... wish you'd changed your mind yourself.
You want to know who Charlie is?
Sure.
We were investigating a gang murder.
We went to interview the suspect's wife,
and the kids are out the front crying,
and I say to her,
"when was the last time
you saw your husband?"
And then from the garage comes this guy
with a 9-millimeter Glock.
And I take one in the shoulder,
but Charlie, he just...
he stands there, toe-to-toe,
and he takes this guy out.
I have not changed my mind
about anything.
Fire in the hole!
Ow!
Ow!
Dr. Hunt, are you okay?
What happened?
The gun bit me.
It's called Beretta bite.
If you're not familiar
with how to handle it,
the slide can give you a nasty cut.
That's good. Maybe it bit
our killer, too.
The crime lab went over
this gun and found nothing.
I didn't see anything in that report
about an ultrasonic alcohol bath.
Hey, and then maybe we could
get our neutron phase analyzers
to create a 3-d hologram
of the actual event. I mean...
Forgive him. Three double espressos.
Caffeine calms me.
It's not working.
The ultrasound would lift any residual
biological material from
the weapon, including yours.
Good evening, doctors.
Sorry for the interruption,
but here's a little gift
from the boys in blue.
In the spirit of cooperation,
we pooled our urine samples.
Oh, my God.
Congratulations...
pissing off an entire
law enforcement agency.
We'll let you get back to work now.
Think I'll let you handle this one.
Departments at war?
Somebody's going down.
How's Ethan doing?
Well, he won't be welcome
back to the lab for a while.
That bottle had a whole witch's brew
of caffeine, mood elevators,
and antidepressants,
but no illegal drugs.
There's nothing from
the alcohol bath either,
except for my own blood and epithelials.
I was thinking about that.
The lab report says the gun
was boxed at the scene.
And ballistics would return
the gun to the same box
to maintain chain of custody.
So the box is...
Is also evidence.
Uh, relax, superwoman.
I already beat you to it.
Please tell me you found
something in that box.
A minute piece of latex.
Uh, it must have gotten caught
in the slide of the gun.
We're running it now for biologicals.
This is pretty damn good, Curtis.
Who's your daddy?
I... I don't get it.
Did somebody bail me out?
Unexpectedly, the charges were dropped.
So I'm free to go.
Yeah.
But there's something you should
know before you leave.
Johnny wasn't who you thought he was.
His real name was Eddie Castillo.
He was an undercover cop.
A cop?
I don't believe it.
He was lying to me the whole time.
Not about everything.
This is the number you were looking for.
Eddie had it on him when he died.
The name is Ray Jones.
He heard your demo tape. He liked it.
He's expecting your phone call
you can get clean.
These people might be able to help.
Oh, my God. Seriously?
Johnny...
he should be here for this.
I'll never get to tell him thank you.
Actually...
you can if you want to.
First a cop killer, now a dirty cop?
It's making me nervous.
Nervous?
You know, trying walking a urine sample
the size of a big gulp
down to the toxicology lab,
then we'll talk nervous.
Anything on the piece of latex
from the gun?
We found D.N.A.,
but it was heavily degraded,
and only a partial profile,
so we can't match it exactly to Meeks.
I thought that we find data
and then draw conclusions.
What he meant was,
there is no way to exclude Meeks
unless he does something
I'm not asking him to do.
What is that?
Give us a blood sample
so we could run a full,
fresh D.N.A. profile.
Please.
I don't understand how this helps.
Detective Meeks,
if you unraveled the double helix ladder,
it would stretch from here
to the moon and back
over 300 times.
However, the D.N.A.
that we found in the gun box
has just a few rungs.
We need the whole ladder to find a match.
Well, are those few rungs of D.N.A.
you found in the box
unique enough to match only one person?
That is a very astute question.
And the short answer is, yes.
Peter.
Trust me.
Okay.
Come on. Let's do it.
So let me get this straight.
You trust him, but you don't trust me?
When that test comes back negative,
what are you gonna say?
That I followed the evidence
where it led me,
with no apology.
Where's that gotten you? Nowhere.
All we're doing is ruling people out.
At least I'm still trying.
Oh, okay, Megan, maybe I deserve that,
but it's a big city,
and whoever this guy is,
we're not gonna get him through
a process of elimination.
Bud.
Thank you so much
for the collective urine sample
from the precinct.
Yours was particularly potent.
I had nothing to do with that.
I thought it was a sick joke
and I told 'em so.
Right.
I just came by to thank you
for talking to Jeannie.
The doctor says she does
have gestational diabetes,
and that it's manageable with diet.
Oh, she'll be fine.
She just needs a little T.L.C.
Yeah, well...
I owe you.
There is something you can do for me.
You're not gonna like it.
You wanted to see me?
Close the door.
I just want to know where your head is.
I brought you the gun like you asked.
And?
Sometimes I want to strangle Megan.
I know the feeling. Believe me.
But I have never once doubted
her commitment to this job.
And I hope I never doubt yours again.
Whitsett... I don't care
what the damn M.E. says,
you gotta...
Yeah.
Hey, speaking of.
What's going on?
Did the test come back?
I'm cleared, right?
Charlie Meeks, you're under arrest
for the murder of Eddie Castillo.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will
be used against you...
- You set me up.
- ...in a court of law.
- What the hell are you doing?
- You have the right to an attorney.
Lopez, back up. He had no choice.
This is crazy. I didn't kill Eddie!
He was my partner.
Do you understand these rights
as I've presented it to you?
I didn't do it!
I don't need to tell you the seriousness
of the charges that Meeks is facing
or the trouble it's gonna be
for this department.
What I need from each of you
is a statement
describing Meeks' involvement
in this case.
If you have no knowledge
of his involvement,
I need you to write that down
and sign your name.
If you were at the crime scene,
if you were at the raid
at Quentin Whitsett's house,
or you engaged detective Meeks
in a conversation about this case,
then you need to write that down
and sign your name.
We'll do this one at a time
in the interrogation room.
What the hell are you doing?
You couldn't at least give me a heads-up?
It was your idea.
My idea? What, to arrest
Charlie for murder?
- Peter.
- What?
Trust me.
Check out the monitor.
They're signing statements. So what?
Process of elimination.
We bust Meeks to sell the idea
we need everyone's statements,
then bring 'em in, make 'em sign
before the camera.
Well, what are you looking for?
Beretta bite.
And you were right about Charlie.
His D.N.A. did not match the fragment
from the gun.
But it's gotta belong to somebody.
I was just hoping it wasn't
gonna be from one of us.
Uh, not so fast, detective.
What? It's all there, captain.
You left out the part
about killing Eddie Castillo.
It's you, you son of a bitch.
You're the dirty cop.
You are a disgrace.
Captain, come on. This is crazy.
You thought you were being so careful
by wearing rubber gloves,
but when you planted Whitsett's
hairs on Eddie's neck,
you left a trace of cornstarch.
And you failed to familiarize
yourself with the gun
before you shot him in the head.
That's how you got the mark on your hand.
I pinched it in a door.
I don't think so.
We have a D.N.A. fragment on the gun box.
A fragment?
You can always give us
a full sample if you like.
I don't think so.
You know what really bugs me?
Guys who don't clean up after
themselves in the break room,
leaving unwashed glasses
with their D.N.A. on it
still lying around.
I'll bet you you're sorry you
stole my wife's O.J. now, right?
Get him outta here.
Lopez, man, what's going on?
Hey, Jeannie.
So this is dinner?
Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't... don't...
don't cry.
No, I... I...
I love beans.
I just love 'em.
Don't worry about it.
First the genetic counselors
scare you to death
with all the things that
could go wrong with the baby,
and now there's something wrong with me.
I am stressed out.
I'm practically useless at work.
And now I get to spend
the next four months praying to God
I don't deliver prematurely.
This is supposed to be, like,
this fresh start for us,
and instead, it's...
it's nine horrifying months
of dodging bullets,
and I don't want to put this on you, but...
But you're going to, so...
Every day you walk out of that door...
I am waiting
for the same phone call
that Eddie Castillo's wife got.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Sometimes, you know, I wondered,
how well I knew the real Eddie when...
he was so good at pretending
to be someone else.
But then I'd catch a look,
see him smile, watch him sleep, and...
and I'd feel his essence, but...
I don't feel anything now.
He really is dead.
There is a poet named...
Thomas Campbell
who said...
"To live in hearts we leave behind"
"is not to die."
Here's your anniversary present.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
In my mind, I'm leaving this town
Headed out to find me something
Sooner or later
gonna get my wish
Thank you for believing in me.
Always.
From love for nothing
Be seeing you around.
Yeah.
Oh, how could it be wrong?
to let yourself get
so afraid of this?
You and Meeks were pretty tight.
Well, that's what happens
when you're in the trenches together.
Are we...
in the trenches together?
Well, it, uh...
sure as hell feels like it, huh?
So are we partners again?
We were never not partners, Megan.
I think we just needed to...
go a round or two.
Yeah.
Exactly.
The higher ground
Oh, uh, by the way,
I think the captain has a thing for you.
Well, how else do you think
that I got the gun?
What did you say to him?
I... I just told him that
you are totally available.
Oh!
You're a rat fink!
I'm not willing
oh, silence
is a sign
that you've got pieces
that you hide away
and even if it's right
it doesn't mean it's safe
take it head-on
even if you lose
head-on
oh, you gotta follow through
and tell me what it's worth
tell me what it's all worth to you
