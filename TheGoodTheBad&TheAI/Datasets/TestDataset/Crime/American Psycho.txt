Our pasta this evening is
squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth...
...with goat cheese profiteroles.
And I also have an arugula Caesar salad.
For entrees, I have swordfish meatloaf
with onion marmalade.
Rare roasted partridge breast
in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale.
And grilled free range rabbit
with herb french fries.
Our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli
in a lemon grass broth....
God, I hate this place.
It's a chick's restaurant.
Why not Dorsia?
Because Bateman won't give
the maître d' head.
Is that Reed Robinson?
-You freebasing? That's not Robinson.
-Who is it then?
-That's Paul Allen.
-That's not Paul Allen.
-Paul Allen's on the other side of the room.
-Who's he with?
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.
Can't do coke in this bathroom.
-Are you sure that's Paul Allen?
-Yes, McDufus.
He handles the Fisher account.
-Lucky bastard.
-Lucky Jew bastard.
What does that have to do with anything?
I've seen that bastard in his office
on the phone with CEO's...
-...spinning a fucking menorah.
-Not a menorah. You spin a dreidel.
Oh, my God, do you want me to fry you up
some fucking potato pancakes?
-Some latkes?
-No. Just...
...cool it with the anti-Semitic remarks.
I forgot. Bateman's dating someone
from the ACLU.
The voice of reason. The boy next door.
Speaking of reasonable...
...only $570.
Not bad.
Two Stoli on the rocks.
These aren't good any more.
It's a cash bar.
That will be $25.
You're a fucking ugly bitch.
I want to stab you to death
and play around with your blood.
I live in the American Gardens Building
on West 81st Street...
...on the 11th floor.
My name is Patrick Bateman.
I'm 27 years old.
I believe in taking care of myself...
...in a balanced diet
and a rigorous exercise routine.
In the morning, if my face is a little puffy...
...I'll put on an ice pack
while doing my stomach crunches.
I can do 1,000 now.
After I remove the ice pack,
I use a deep pore cleanser lotion.
In the shower,
I use a water-activated gel cleanser...
...then, a honey-almond body scrub...
...and on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub.
Then, I apply a herb mint facial mask...
...which I leave on for 10 minutes,
while I prepare the rest of my routine.
I always use an aftershave lotion
with little or no alcohol...
...because alcohol dries your face out
and makes you look older...
...then, moisturizer...
...then, an anti-ageing eye balm...
...followed by
a final moisturizing protective lotion.
There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman...
...some kind of abstraction,
but there is no real me...
...only an entity, something illusory.
And though I can hide my cold gaze...
...and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh gripping yours...
...and maybe you can even sense
our lifestyles are probably comparable...
...I simply am not there.
Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.
-Late?
-Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
Ricky Harrison cancelled. He didn't say
what he was canceling or why.
I occasionally box with Ricky
at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
Spencer wants to meet for drinks
at Fluties Pier 17.
-When?
-After 6:00.
Negative. Cancel it.
-And what should I say?
-Just say no.
Just say no?
Okay, Jean.
I need reservations for three at Camols...
...at 12:30 and if not, try Crayons.
-All right?
-Yes sir.
Wait. And I need reservations for two...
...at Arcadia at 8:00 on Thursday.
Something romantic?
No.
Silly.
-Forget it. I'll make them.
-No, I'll do it.
No. Be a doll and just get me
a mineral water, okay?
-You look nice today.
-Don't wear that outfit again.
What? I didn't hear you.
I said, "Do not wear that outfit again."
Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
-You don't like this, I take it?
-Come on...
...you're prettier than that.
Thanks, Patrick.
I'm not here. And high heels.
I like high heels.
Hundreds, thousands of roses.
And lots of chocolate truffles. Godiva.
And oysters on the half shell.
I'm listening
to the new Robert Palmer tape...
...but Evelyn, my supposed fiancée,
keeps buzzing in my ear.
Photographers.
Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz.
And we'll have to get someone
to videotape it.
Patrick, we should do it.
Do what?
-Get married.
-No. I can't take the time off work.
Your father owns the company.
You can do anything, silly.
-I don't want to talk about it.
-You hate that job anyway.
I don't see why you just don't quit.
Because I want to fit in.
Williams' party.
I'm on the verge of tears
by the time we arrive at Espace...
...since I'm positive
we won't have a decent table.
But we do.
And relief washes over me
in an awesome wave.
This is my cousin,
Vanden, and her boyfriend, Stash.
-They're both artists.
-The menu is in braille.
I'm fairly certain that Timothy Bryce
and Evelyn are having an affair.
Timothy is the only interesting person
I know.
I'm almost completely indifferent
as to whether Evelyn knows...
...I'm having an affair
with Courtney Rawlinson...
...her closest friend.
Courtney is almost perfect looking.
She usually operates
on one or more psychiatric drugs.
Tonight, I believe it's Xanax.
More disturbing than her drug use,
though...
...is the fact that she's engaged
to Luis Carruthers.
-The biggest dufus in the business.
-Tell me, Stash...
...do you think Soho is becoming
too commercial?
Yes, I read that.
Who gives a rat's ass?
That affects us.
What about the massacres
in Sri Lanka, honey?
Doesn't that affect us too?
Do you know anything about Sri Lanka?
The Sikhs are killing tons of Israelis.
Come on, Bryce. There are a lot more
important problems than Sri Lanka...
-...to worry about.
-Like what?
We have to end apartheid for one.
And slow down the nuclear arms race.
Stop terrorism and world hunger.
We have to provide food and shelter
for the homeless.
And oppose racial discrimination
and promote civil rights...
...while also promoting equal rights
for women.
We have to encourage a return...
...to traditional, moral values.
Most importantly, we have to promote
general social concern.
And less materialism in young people.
Patrick...
...how thought provoking.
Hello.
Hello.
Bleaching? Are you trying
to say bleaching? Oh, my God.
Two things. One. You can't bleach
a Cerruti. Out of the question.
Two. I can only get these sheets
in Santa Fe.
These are very expensive sheets
and I need them clean.
If you don't shut your fucking mouth,
I will kill you.
I'm having lunch at Hubert's
in 20 minutes with Ronald Harrison.
I need those sheets cleaned this afternoon.
Listen, I cannot understand you!
This is crazy. You're a fool.
I can't cope with this.
Stupid bleaching! Understand!
Patrick?
-Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
-Hello.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way
up here, but they're the best.
Then why can't they get the stains out?
I mean, can you talk to these people
or something? I'm not getting anywhere.
What are those?
It's cranberry juice. Cranapple.
Really?
If you could talk to them,
I'd really appreciate it. I'm really late.
-I have to be at Hubert's in 15 minutes.
-Hubert's? That moved uptown, right?
Well, boy, I've got to go.
Thank you, Victoria.
Maybe we could do lunch next week?
-I'm downtown at--
-I don't know.
-I'm at work all the time.
-What about a Saturday?
-Next Saturday?
-Sure.
Can't, I've matinee of Les Mis.
-I've really got to go. Christ! I'll call you.
-Okay.
Do.
You're dating Luis. He's in Arizona.
You're fucking me.
We haven't made plans.
What could you be up to tonight?
-Stop it. I'm....
-On a lot of lithium?
Waiting for Luis to call me.
He said he'd call tonight.
Pumpkin?
You're dating an asshole.
Pumpkin, you're dating
the biggest dickweed in New York.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling,
tumbling dickweed.
Patrick, stop calling me Pumpkin, okay?
I have to go.
Courtney? Dinner?
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Dorsia's nice.
Wear something fabulous.
-Dorsia.
-Yes.
I know it's late, but is it possible to reserve
a table for two at 8:00 or 8:30 perhaps?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden,
which was really relaxing...
...and then to the Pottery Barn...
...where I got this little silver muffin dish.
-Is that Donald Trump's car?
-Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
You should take more lithium
or have a Diet Coke.
Some caffeine might get you
out of this slump.
I just want a child.
Just two perfect...
...children.
-Are we here?
-Yeah.
This is Dorsia?
Yes, dear.
You're gonna have the peanut butter soup
with smoked duck and mashed squash.
New York Matinée called it,
"a playful but mysterious little dish."
You'll love it.
And then the red snapper
with violets and pine nuts.
I think that'll follow nicely.
Thanks, Patrick.
Patrick, thanks so much
for looking after Courtney.
Dorsia, how impressive!
How on earth did you get a reservation?
Lucky, I guess.
That's a wonderful suit.
Don't tell me, let me guess.
Valentino Couture?
It looks so soft.
Your compliment was sufficient, Luis.
Hello, Halberstram. Nice tie.
How the hell are you?
Allen has mistaken me for this dickhead,
Marcus Halberstram.
It seems logical because
Marcus also works at P & P...
...and does the same exact thing I do.
He also has a penchant for Valentino suits
and Oliver People's glasses.
We even go to the same barber,
although I have a slightly better haircut.
So how's the Ransom account going?
-It's all right.
-Really? That's interesting. It's not...
-...great?
-Well, you know.
-So how's Cecelia? She's a great girl.
-Yeah.
-I'm very lucky.
-Hey, Allen!
-Congratulations on the Fisher account.
-Thank you, Baxter.
Paul. Squash?
Call me.
-How about Friday?
-No can do.
I got an 8:30 res at Dorsia.
Great sea urchin ceviche.
Dorsia on a Friday night?
How'd he swing that?
I think he's lying.
Is that a gram?
New card. What do you think?
Very nice.
Look at that.
Picked them up yesterday.
-Good coloring.
-That's bone.
And the lettering is something
called Silian Rail.
It's very cool, Bateman. But that's nothing.
-Look at this.
-That is really nice.
Eggshell with Romalian type.
What do you think?
Nice.
Jesus. That is really super.
How'd a nitwit like you get so tasteful?
I can't believe that Bryce prefers
Van Patten's card to mine.
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Raised lettering, Pale Nimbus.
White.
Impressive. Very nice.
Let's see Paul Allen's card.
Look at that subtle off-white coloring.
The tasteful thickness of it.
Oh, my God, it even has a watermark.
Is something wrong?
Patrick? You're sweating.
Hello. Pat Bateman.
You want some money?
Some food?
-Is this what you need?
-I'm hungry.
Yeah, it's cold out too, isn't it?
Why don't you get a job?
-lf you're so hungry, why not get a job?
-I lost my job.
Why? You're drinking?
Is that why you lost it?
Insider trading?
Just joking.
What's your name?
-Al.
-Speak up! Come on.
-Al.
-Get a goddamn job, Al.
You've got a negative attitude.
That's what's stopping you.
You've got to get your act together.
I'll help you.
You are so kind, mister. You're kind.
-You're a kind man.
-It's okay.
Please, you got to tell me what to do.
You got to help me. I'm so cold.
I'm hungry.
Do you know how bad you smell?
You reek of shit. Do you know that?
I'm sorry.
It's just that....
I don't know.
I don't have anything in common with you.
Thank you, mister. Thank you.
I'm cold out here.
Do you know what a fucking loser you are?
What beautiful skin you have,
Mr. Bateman.
So fine. So smooth.
I have all the characteristics
of a human being:
Flesh, blood, skin, hair.
But not a single clear,
identifiable emotion...
...except for greed and disgust.
Something horrible is happening
inside of me.
And I don't know why.
My nightly bloodlust has overflowed
into my days.
I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy.
I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.
Hey, McCloy, what do you say?
Hamilton, have a holly jolly Christmas.
Is Allen still handling the Fisher account?
-Of course, who else?
-Mistletoe alert!
Merry Xmas, Patrick! Merry Xmas, Harry!
-Merry Christmas.
-You're late, honey.
-No.
-Yes, you are.
I've been here the entire time.
You just didn't see me.
Say hello to Snowball. Snowball says,
"Merry Christmas, Patrick."
-What is it?
-It's a little baby piggy-wiggy, isn't it?
It's a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig.
They make darling pets. Don't you?
Stop scowling, Patrick.
You're such a Grinch.
What's Mr. Grinch want for Christmas?
And don't say breast implants again.
-Allen!
-Marcus!
Merry Christmas! How have you been?
Workaholic, I suppose.
Haven't seen you in a while.
Hamilton, we're going to Nell's.
Limo's out front.
-We should have dinner.
-Maybe you could bring....
-Cecelia?
-Yes, Cecelia.
Cecelia would adore it.
Well then, let's do it, Marcus.
-Great party.
-Thanks.
Patrick, why is he calling you Marcus?
Mistletoe alert!
Marcus Halberstram for two at 7:00.
No, I want to know....
Okay, I came here
for the cilantro fish gumbo, all right?
It's the only excuse one could have
for being here, which is...
...by the way, almost completely empty.
-I'm very sorry, sir.
-J & B straight and a Corona.
-Would you like to--
-Double Absolut martini!
Yes, sir.
-Would you like to hear the specials?
-Not if you want to keep your spleen.
This is a real beehive of activity,
Halberstram.
This place is hot, very hot.
The mud soup and the charcoal arugula
are outrageous here.
Yeah, well, you're late.
I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break.
I see they've omitted the pork loin
with lime Jell-O.
We should've gone to Dorsia.
-I could've gotten us a table.
-Nobody goes there anymore.
Is that lvana Trump?
Jeez, Patrick. I mean Marcus.
What are you thinking?
Why would lvana be at Texarkana?
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling
the Fisher account?
How'd you get it?
I could tell you that, Halberstram...
...but then I'd have to kill you.
I like to dissect girls.
Did you know I'm utterly insane?
Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive.
-Where do you tan?
-Salon.
I've got a tanning bed at home.
You should look into it.
And Cecelia? How is she?
-Where is she tonight?
-Well, you know Cecelia....
I think she's having dinner
with Evelyn Williams.
Evelyn?
Great ass. Goes out with that loser,
Patrick Bateman. What a dork!
Another martini, Paul?
You like Huey Lewis & the News?
They're okay.
Their early work was
a little too New Wave for my taste.
But when Sports came out in '83...
...I think they really came into their own,
commercially and artistically.
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound...
...and a new sheen
of consummate professionalism...
...that really gives the songs a big boost.
He's been compared to Elvis Costello.
But I think Huey has a far more bitter,
cynical sense of humor.
-Hey, Halberstram?
-Yes, Allen?
Why are there copies of the Style section
all over the place?
Do you have a dog?
A little chow or something?
No, Allen.
-Is that a raincoat?
-Yes, it is.
In 1987, Huey released this,
Four, their most accomplished album.
I think their undisputed masterpiece is
Hip To Be Square.
A song so catchy that most people
probably don't listen to the lyrics.
But they should because it's not just
about the pleasures of conformity...
...and the importance of trends. It's also
a personal statement about the band itself.
Hey, Paul!
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now,
you fucking stupid bastard!
Patrick? Patrick?
-Is that you?
-No, Luis. It's not me.
You're mistaken.
This is my very good friend,
Patrick Bateman.
Where are you going?
We're going to Nell's.
Gwendolyn's father is buying it.
Where did you get that overnight bag?
Jean Paul Gaultier.
When I get to Paul Allen's place,
I use the keys I took from his pocket...
...before disposing of the body.
There is a moment of sheer panic...
...when I realize that Paul's apartment
overlooks the park.
And is obviously more expensive
than mine.
I calm myself,
and move into the bedroom...
...where I find his suitcase and
start to pack.
It's time for Paul to take a little trip.
Where to send the bastard?
Dallas?
Paris? Singapore? London?
I'll send the asshole to London.
Hi, this is Paul.
I've been called to London for a few days.
Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.
Hasta la vista, baby.
What is it?
Patrick, it's just....
Yes, Jean?
-Mr. Donald Kimball is here to see you.
-Who?
Detective Donald Kimball?
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Patrick, it's only 10:30.
I think he knows you're here.
Send him in, I guess.
Now John, you've got to wear clothes
in proportion to your physique.
There are definite do's and don'ts,
good buddy, of wearing a bold stripe shirt.
A bold striped shirt calls for solid colored
or discreetly patterned suits and ties.
Yes, always tip the stylist 15%.
Listen John, I've got to go.
T. Bone Pickens just walked in.
Just joking.
No, don't tip the owner of the salon.
Okay John, right, got it.
Sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
I should've made an appointment.
Was that anything important?
That? Just mulling
over business problems.
Examining opportunities.
Exchanging rumors.
Spreading gossip.
Hi. I'm Donald Kimball.
-Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
-Sorry to barge in on you like this.
I know how busy you guys can get.
So, what's the...
-...topic of discussion?
-I've been hired by Meredith Powell...
...to investigate the disappearance
of Paul Allen.
I see, Paul's disappearance, yeah.
It's nothing that official.
I just have some basic questions
about Paul and yourself.
-Coffee?
-No, I'm okay.
-Apollinaris?
-No, I'm okay.
-Can you bring Mr....
-Kimball.
-A bottle of--
-No, really, I'm okay.
It's no problem.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
Disappearance of Paul Allen.
Right. Well, l....
I haven't heard anything
about the disappearance or anything.
Not on page six, at least.
-His family wants this kept quiet.
-Understandable.
-Lime?
-No, really. I'm okay.
Sure? I can get you a lime.
Just some preliminary questions
that I need for my own files, okay?
Shoot.
-How old are you?
-27.
-Where did you go to school?
-Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Your address?
American Gardens Building,
West 81st Street.
Nice. Very nice.
Thanks.
-What can you tell me about Paul Allen?
-I'm at a loss.
-He was part of that whole Yale thing.
-Yale thing?
Yeah. Yale thing.
What do you mean?
Well, I think for one that
he was probably a closet homosexual...
...who did a lot of cocaine. That Yale thing.
What kind of a man was he? Besides
the information you've just given me?
-I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
-Do you feel like that?
No. Not really.
Where did Paul hang out?
-Hang out?
-Yeah. You know, hang out.
Let me think.
The Newport. Harry's. Fluties.
Indochine. Nell's. The Cornell Club.
-The New York Yacht Club.
-He had a yacht?
-No, he just hung out there.
-And where did he go to school?
-Don't you know this?
-I just wanted to know if you know.
Before Yale?
If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's.
Listen, I just want to help.
I understand.
Any witnesses or fingerprints?
There's a message on his answering
machine that says he went to London.
-Maybe he did.
-His girlfriend doesn't think so.
-Has anyone seen him in London?
-Actually, yes.
But I've had difficulty getting
an actual verification.
A Stephen Hughes said he saw him
at a restaurant there.
But I checked it out and what happened is,
he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth for Paul.
-Had his apartment been burglarized?
-No, actually it hadn't.
Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone.
So was some luggage. That's it.
Anyone dealing with the homicide squad?
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure.
Basically, no one's seen or heard anything.
-So typical, isn't it?
-It's just strange.
One day someone's walking around,
going to work...
-...alive, and then....
-Nothing.
People just disappear.
The earth just opens up
and swallows them.
Eerie. Really eerie.
You'll have to excuse me.
I have a meeting with Cliff Huxtable...
...at the Four Seasons in 20 minutes.
The Four Seasons?
Isn't that a little far uptown?
Aren't you going to be late?
No. There's one down here.
-Really? I didn't know that.
-Yes, it's very good.
Listen, if anything occurs to you,
any information--
Absolutely, I'm 1 00% with you.
Great. And thanks for your time,
Mr. Bateman.
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.
-I haven't seen you around here.
-You just haven't been looking.
Would you like to see my apartment?
I'm not supposed to.
Do you want to come
to my apartment or not?
I'm not supposed to,
but I can make an exception.
Do you take a credit card?
I'm joking. Come on, get in.
I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde,
who does couples.
Couples. I really can't stress
blonde enough.
Blonde.
I'm Paul. My name is Paul Allen.
You got that?
You're Christie.
You are to respond only to Christie.
Is that clear?
It's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking.
I want you to clean your vagina.
No, from behind.
Get on your knees.
You have a very nice body.
Thank you. Send her up.
Christie, get out and dry off, choose a robe.
Not the Bijan.
Then, come and meet me and our guest
in the living room for drinks.
You've arrived! How lovely.
Let me take your coat. I'm Paul.
How good of you to come.
Not quite blonde, are you?
More dirty blonde.
I'm going to call you Sabrina.
I'm Paul Allen.
So...
...don't you want to know what I do?
No.
No, not really.
Well, I work on Wall Street.
At Pierce & Pierce.
Have you heard of it?
You have a really nice place here, Paul.
How much did you pay for it?
Well actually, that's none of your business.
But I can assure you,
it certainly wasn't cheap.
No. No smoking. Not in here.
Varda Truffle?
I don't want you to get drunk, but...
...that's a very fine Chardonnay
you're not drinking.
Do you like Phil Collins?
I've been a big Genesis fan ever since
the release of their 1980 album...
...Duke.
Before that I really didn't understand
any of their work.
It's too artsy, too intellectual.
It was on Duke, where Phil Collins'
presence became more apparent.
I think Invisible Touch is
the group's undisputed masterpiece.
It's an epic meditation on intangibility.
At the same time,
it deepens and enriches...
...the meaning
of the preceding three albums.
Christie, take off the robe.
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing
of Banks, Collins, and Rutherford.
You can practically hear every nuance
of every instrument.
Sabrina, remove your dress.
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship
and sheer song writing...
...this album hits a new peak
of professionalism.
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?
Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion...
...in this song, Phil Collins addresses
the problems of abusive political authority.
In Too Deep is the most moving pop song
of the 1980s...
...about monogamy and commitment.
The song is extremely uplifting.
Their lyrics are
as positive and affirmative...
...as anything I've heard in rock.
Christie, get down on your knees,
so Sabrina can see your asshole.
Phil Collins' solo career...
...seems to be more commercial...
...and therefore,
more satisfying in a narrower way...
...especially songs like In the Air Tonight
and Against All Odds.
Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it.
I also think that Phil Collins works best
within the confines of the group...
...than as a solo artist.
And I stress the word "artist."
This is Sussudio, a great, great song.
A personal favorite.
Don't touch the watch.
Can we go now?
We're not through yet.
If they have a good personality
and aren't great looking, then who cares?
Let's say hypothetically, okay?
What if they have a good personality?
I know, I know.
"There are no girls
with good personalities."
A good personality consists
of a chick with a hard body...
...who'll satisfy all sexual demands
without being too slutty...
...and who'll keep her dumb,
fucking mouth shut.
The only girls with good personalities,
smart...
...funny, halfway intelligent, or talented...
...though God knows what the fuck
that means, are ugly chicks.
This is because they have to make up
for how fucking ugly they are.
-You know what Ed Gein said?
-Ed Gein? Maître d' at Canal Bar?
-No. Serial killer, Wisconsin in the '50s.
-And what did Ed say?
"When I see a pretty girl,
I think of two things...
"...one part of me wants to take her out...
"...talk to her, be real nice and sweet
and treat her right."
What did the other part of him think?
What her head would look like on a stick.
Hi, guys. I want to get your opinion
on something.
It's my business card.
I decided to get a new one, too.
Very nice, Luis.
Thank you.
What about dinner?
Is that all you ever have to contribute?
What about fucking dinner?
Cheer up there. What's the matter?
No shiatsu today?
Touch me again
and you'll draw back a stump.
-Hold on there, little buddy.
-Excuse me.
Patrick, why here?
I've seen you looking at me.
I've noticed your...
...hot body.
Don't be shy.
You can't imagine how long I've wanted
this, ever since that party at Arizona 206.
You know, the one you were wearing that
red striped paisley Armani tie.
I want you.
I want you, too.
-Patrick!
-What is it?
Where are you going?
I've got to return some video tapes.
I'll call you.
I've been wanting to talk with you!
Come in to my office.
Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?
Do you remember where you were
the night of Paul's disappearance?
Which was on December 20?
God, I guess
I was probably returning videotapes.
-I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
-That's not what I've got.
-What?
-That's not the information I've received.
Well, wait.
What information have you received?
Let me see.
-That you were with--
-Well, I could be wrong.
When was the last time you were
with Paul Allen?
We'd gone to a new musical called...
...Oh Africa, Brave Africa.
It was a laugh riot. That was about it.
I think we had dinner at Orso's.
No, Petaluma. No, Orso's.
I hope I've been informative, long day.
I'm a bit scattered.
I'm a little spent now too.
How about lunch in a week or so,
when I've sorted out all this information?
Great, yes, I'd like that.
If you could try and pin down
where you were...
...the night of Allen's disappearance,
it would make my job a lot easier.
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
Huey Lewis & the News.
Great stuff. I just bought it
on my way here. You heard it?
Never. I mean, I don't really like singers.
Not a big music fan?
No, I like music.
Just, they're....
