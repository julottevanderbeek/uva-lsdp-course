Nice car.
Sweet!
Nice.
You little maggot!
-You get back here!
-What are you doing?
This your kid?
Take a look at his hand.
You'll find the valve caps to my '59 Caddy.
Is that true, Jesse?
How many times have I told you
to stop stealing parts off people's cars!
Go on inside. Go!
I'm really sorry about this.
You know how kids can be.
That's all right. No harm done.
Where are you from?
I've never seen you before.
Just sort of passing through.
I remember saying that very same thing.
That was about four years ago.
You from L.A.?
No, ma'am. Jersey City, mostly.
What's with this "ma'am" stuff?
Am I looking that old already?
No, ma'am.
-There you go again.
-I'm just playing around.
I'm Cybil Waingrow.
Very nice name.
That's Cybil with a "C,"
not Sybil with an "S."
Really?
It's a pleasure to meet you, Cybil,
with or without a "C."
It's nice to meet you. You drink coffee?
That's a start.
You got any money?
Wow! Jersey's, like,
Mom, can I have a Coke or something?
Can't you see I'm talking?
Mom, why can't....
Sweetie, I didn't bring my purse with me.
Hey, hang on a second.
Here.
Go get yourself whatever you want.
Wow, $5. Thanks, mister.
-Hey, Dorth.
-Yeah, Jesse?
You like kids?
I'm not much the fathering type,
to tell you the truth.
Austin, my ex, named him after
Jesse James, the bank robber.
-Hell of a role model.
-That's what I said.
I have $5.
Where is Daddy now?
I don't know.
It's hard to keep track when you
write them and they don't write you back.
Who cares, anyhow?
Not me.
Wow! You must think
I'm some cheap date.
No, sir. I don't know how
you city folks work.
But here, it takes a lot more than
a cup of coffee and a plate of chow...
...to get a sophisticated woman like me
into the sack.
That's for damn sure.
You do make that cigarette look good.
-You make that dress look good.
-You're so sweet.
Do I owe you anything? You know, like....
I didn't mean to offend, I just....
I haven't been with a woman
in a really long time, okay?
-Right.
-I'm serious.
Like five-and-a-half-year serious,
you know what I mean?
Oh, my God!
You just got out!
I'm sorry.
Well, I guess we're even.
Wait a minute.
Michael, you don't offer a woman money
if it's been nice.
You give her flowers or chocolate
or something.
You know what I mean?
Hey, Murph!
This must be our singer.
Yeah, because we know you can't sing.
Yeah, but I play a mean guitar.
Mike.
Hey, man. You're looking....
-Yeah!
-You look good.
-You feel good?
-Yeah.
-Enjoying your freedom?
-Ain't free yet.
Come on, it's a whole lot better
than that cage we shared.
Big sky, lots of space.
Not enough water.
"Not enough water."
It'll always be something with you, Mike.
Well, you know me.
Who's the kid?
I don't know.
Looks like he knows you.
Just because that kid is packing heat,
doesn't make him my partner.
That's right.
I'm your partner.
Ready to play?
Always ready to play, Murph.
What's up, Michael?
These your new girlfriends?
What's happening, man?
Franklin.
Get in the back.
-Move over, Gus.
-I got window.
Great, so I get bitch. That's nice.
What's up?
-Hey, kid.
-Yeah.
You ever shoot anybody with them things?
Didn't think so.
Hey, Murphy.
What's the smartest thing
ever come out of a bitch's mouth?
-What?
-Einstein's cock!
That's a good one.
What are you so quiet about?
I told you, I hate the desert.
Yeah, I know, for the second time now.
Check it out!
Deathmatch 3000.
In the red corner, Frank Sinatra.
And in the blue corner, Elvis Presley.
I'm not talking about no cartoon shit.
The real deal!
Real cats scrapping it out!
Who's going down?
The Chairman of the Board and
the King are looking mighty mean tonight.
I'll tell you, the King lands one
right in the Chairman's nuts!
-Hot tamale!
-There it is, baby.
But the King slips!
He goes down and Ol' Blue Eyes goes in
for the Italian Necktie!
The King is down!
The King is down! No!
Fuck, man! Let me know
when you're going to do that.
Who said "the King is down"?
-Let it go.
-Did I say something to you?
Then shut the fuck up.
Who said "the King is down"?
-We were just having a little fun.
-I know.
So, who said it?
I said it, Murphy.
Don't say it any fucking more.
-It was just a joke.
-Well, it wasn't fucking funny.
Sinatra.
Fuck Sinatra. Nobody fucks with the King
and nobody ever says he's down.
Hey, Murphy, we all love the King.
That's right.
Elvis would beat Sinatra's ass!
That's fucking right.
What's the best thing
about dating homeless girls?
You can drop them off anywhere.
Let me out!
Damn, my ass is all sweaty.
Murph.
Good to see you, Jack.
Really good to see you.
-Michael.
-Jack, how are you doing?
How does it feel to be out?
-You know how it feels.
-Yes, I do.
-You got them?
-Inside.
Hey, Franklin.
Stop. You're killing me, man.
You're killing me.
Pretty loose group you got there.
-Don't shoot me!
-Dance, motherfucker!
-They dialed in?
-They're good on stage.
It's going to be some show!
The snakeskin is mine.
-I got that one.
-That's mine.
Hey, Michael.
It's good to see you.
-You want to come in?
-No, I can't.
Really, I just wanted to ask you....
Well, maybe for a second or two.
You haven't seen my wallet,
by any chance?
Your wallet?
I had it yesterday when I paid the check
at the coffee shop.
I was just backtracking my steps.
Well, I haven't seen it.
Jesse, get back here!
Did you take this man's wallet?
Don't shut that door on me!
Don't lock it.
He does this all the time. Sorry.
Would you hand me that little stepladder
over there, please?
Thank you.
He's like a ferret. Takes anything
he can get his hands on and hides it all...
...up...
...here.
Sorry about this.
There was....
Money?
$460, yeah.
Is this it?
Just about.
Sorry for all the trouble.
He really isn't a bad kid.
I'm sure he's an angel.
Wait a minute.
-I can get your money back.
-It's okay. It's just...
...$20.
How about...
...l'll pay it back to you
with another cup of coffee?
Time to go to work, baby.
Let's do it.
Here we are
at the Riviera Hoteland Casino...
...andit's lnternational Elvis Week.
I don't know what the big deal is.
That porker has been dead
for 20 years now.
He was a god.
And second, he ain't dead.
We've gone from Rat Pack to Fat Pack.
Murphy.
Long time no see.
Back off.
Watch yourself, son.
That's no way to treat your friends.
I never met you in my life.
Be smart and take a fucking walk.
Hey, man, now come on, don't be cruel.
Would you?
Thank you.
Honey, doesn't he look marvelous?
We think you look just marvelous!
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you very much.
Sorry.
What's the problem?
Emergency stop on nine.
Probably some couple screwing again.
Do we have visual?
No. Sir, the camera in car eight is down.
Switch to override. Bring it down for
a security check. Have security waiting.
All right, everybody stay cool.
Back up.
White is light, red is dead.
I'm only going to say this once.
Who is listening?
I am.
In the corner, now.
Get on your knees, put your heads
on the ground. What's your problem?
What's your problem?
He's deaf!
Well, you're not.
Put his head on the fucking ground.
$50s and $100s, no cellophane.
Holy shit!
Main booth, scramble security.
Call Vegas P.D. We need backup.
-Shut up.
-Shut up!
Let's go. Come on, Gus.
Come on, Gus!
Let's go, Gus.
That's enough!
They're coming out. Do not engage
on floor, direct them to B-41 .
Intercept there. B-4-1.
They're at Registration.
Vegas P.D. en route.
Right at VIP.
Let me know if they follow, Hanson.
Station 3, where are you?
They're coming.
Nothing'll happen here.
Left at dollar slots.
Relax, Gus.
They're moving us.
Anyone gets between us and Michael,
it's on.
They're in B-41 .
Freeze! Hold it right there.
Everyone we got, now, scramble!
Go!
Give me the fucking camera !
Missed me, bitch!
Come on!
Let's go! Franklin, let's go!
Come on!
Knock them down, Michael!
Let's go!
Freeze! Vegas P.D.!
Get the gun!
Take us up, Mike!
Franklin is hit!
Franklin, come on! You'll make it!
Fifteen, one to go!
Clear!
Where the hell is he?
Christ, Murph, what's the deal?
Fuck!
He'll be here.
"Just slip out the back, Jack
"Make a new plan, Stan
"You don't need to be coy, Roy
"Just listen to me
"Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
"Just drop off the key, Lee
And set yourself free"
Helicopter!
Let's go!
Ladies and gentlemen,
Elvis has left the building!
Hang in there!
-You're going to make it!
-You're going to be okay, Franklin!
I'm dying!
-Put pressure on it!
-I'm dying, man!
I won't make it!
Hang on!
Help me!
Is he gonna make it?
Fuck him.
How you doing?
Where is the pisser?
-Nice place you got here.
-A real shit hole.
Gus, give me a hand.
Oh, yeah.
That's a lot of money.
$3.2 million.
$3.2 million?
That's a beautiful thing.
Less Jack's 10 percent.
Right.
Damn.
That's a lot of money
just to fly a helicopter.
Would you rather we used
a hot air balloon?
No.
Or maybe hang gliders?
Would you rather we used hang gliders?
I don't know what a hang glider is.
I doubt you know how to fly
a fucking helicopter, either.
If you ask me, $320,000 is well worth it.
Besides, Jack has
taken care of a lot of shit...
...you don't know anything about.
All right. Back to business.
Where is Franklin's pile?
What are you talking about?
Franklin. Anybody remember him?
I was there. Franklin is dead.
Right. So, where is Franklin's pile?
Well, Murph, we don't make him a pile.
We split up four ways.
Wrong. Franklin's pile
does not get split up.
Sure, I'm good with that.
Bullshit!
Who gets the remaining 15 percent, then?
-Let me guess.
-It was my deal, Hanson.
No, I want that 15 percent
split up four ways.
-You want?
-Yeah, I want.
Well, I could give a flying fuck
what you want.
A deal is a deal.
Let me put it this way.
That fucking deal died with Franklin.
Now, it's time to make a new deal.
That's a commitment, Hanson.
I'll give you that.
Fuck it. We shot everybody in the casino,
let's start shooting each other.
Come on, you guys, let's just settle down,
all right? We don't need this.
Gus is right. Let's just keep this simple.
I'll take my 15 percent, plus 25 percent
of Franklin's end, and I'll take it now.
-I'm not letting that happen.
-Why the hell not?
Because that would change the plan,
and when plans change...
...things get fucked up!
-You'll have to learn to be more flexible.
-The plan stays!
We have an arrangement in Twin Falls...
...where we'll get 70 cents on the dollar.
We'll keep that arrangement.
All of us.
After that, I'm over the border into Canada
and you can all get on Michael's boat...
...for all I care.
No. Nobody gets on my boat but me.
Right.
Whatever.
If anyone goes before then,
there's a chance you'll spend the money.
You spend the money, you'll get popped.
And the chances are you'll talk.
Either way, I'm not taking that chance.
Murph, I've been doing this a long time
and I've never dropped dime on anybody.
Want to keep blowing smoke in my face,
or you want me to blow your head off?
You go do whatever it is you got to do
in Twin Falls or wherever.
That's your criminal right.
Me, I'm staying right here.
You both have hot sheets.
Instead of traveling with you...
...l should be putting as much distance
from you as humanly possible.
Traveling with you fucks
is the weakest part of the plan.
But since we don't trust each other,
we'll travel north together as a group.
So, try to think of us as the Osmonds,
only we don't fucking get along.
Gentlemen, as far as I'm concerned,
this job is done.
I'm cashing out.
Just give me my fucking money.
Is that an order?
No, come on, that wasn't an order.
I mean, technically it wasn't.
-What about you, Gus?
-What?
You think this is your fucking money?
No, no. This is my money.
That's your money.
Michael.
I just want to get on the move, Murph.
Makes you the only fucking pig
in the room, Hanson.
You make me laugh, you know?
I can't imagine what goes through
that sick mind of yours.
Sometimes I actually think you believe
you're the King himself.
What is it with those side burns?
I glued mine on for the job.
For you, it's an actual lifestyle choice.
-Shut up.
-I'm serious!
Shut up.
It's fucking sad, man.
Nevertheless, I do know the golden rule.
And what's that, sweetheart?
Fuck the gold.
He who has the nickel plating...
...makes the rules.
You shot him !
That's right, Gus.
Now, I'm going to kill him.
Sweetheart.
Wrap him up.
Wrap him up.
Wrap him up!
Fuck!
-Anybody?
-No.
We need some towels!
He's bleeding all over the place.
Hey, Murph.
How are we going to
split up the money now?
Hey, this boy is heavy.
I think he had one too many peanut butter
and fried banana sandwiches.
God!
Need a ride, fella?
Thanks.
Fuck!
A raidas wild and as daring as
anything seen on the American landscape.
The Riviera Hoteland Casino
exploded today in a shower of gunfire...
...during the international Elvis Convention.
Where's Jesse?
Come here, you little shit!
What the hell....
Where is it? Where is that damn money?
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I'm calling the cops right now.
and location of the emergency.
Yes, hello.
Hello?
This is the 911 operator.
Hello, ma 'am?
Ma 'am?
I thought you might change your mind.
Where did you get that?
You're the one. The casino in Vegas.
It's all over the news.
That's you.
-Get over there and sit down.
-Go.
That's $100,000 in there.
Just for you to keep your mouth shut.
You don't have to pay me off,
I won't tell anybody.
No, you're not.
All I need is a couple of days.
After that, you can do
whatever the hell you want.
Everything is understood?
I got it.
Well.
Hey, Elvis.
Is there any chance that
I might be able to see you again?
Sorry, Cybil.
Are you 100 percent sure of that?
Yeah, 100,000 percent.
-I need your car.
-What?
Yeah, the old Valiant out there.
Where are the keys?
I'm not giving that to you.
Yeah, you are.
Because I just gave you $100,000 for it.
I don't care how much you just gave me.
Anyway, it's not my car.
It's my grandmother's.
-You either give me the keys right now--
-Or what?
You're going to kill us?
You know, there is a simple solution here.
Yeah, there is.
You can take us with you.
What?
Why not? Where are you going?
I haven't got time for this.
You got three seconds to get me
those keys...
...or I'll splatter cherry pie
on that wall behind you and...
...l'm dead serious about that. One, two....
Stop pointing that gun at my mom.
Who's there?
It's the police.
Can you open the door, please?
Mom, money!
Sit down.
Sit down!
Mom, get the door.
Can I help you?
Evening. We received
an emergency 91 1 call from this room.
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.
The call was disconnected.
We were in the neighborhood.
Everything okay?
Yeah, it's fine.
We were just fixing to leave.
Can we come in, ma'am?
Of course you can.
...Elvis impersonators made it up the
elevator and to the roof where they were...
...taken by helicopter,
we don't know where.
Are you the man of the house?
We just got engaged.
-Congratulations.
-Thank you. We're really excited about it.
We're about to go on a trip
to the Grand Canyon.
-Jesse, why don't you go get your stuff?
-Okay.
Well, I'll be right back.
So, which of you is
the one who dialed 91 1?
I'm sorry.
I was trying to dial 41 1 for information
and I dialed 9 by mistake.
Well, I guess we're all set here.
-We'll be on our way.
-So are we.
Come on.
Ma'am, can I give you a hand
with your bag?
If you wouldn't mind. It's really heavy.
We got a lot of schoolbooks.
It would be my pleasure.
We'll be right there.
Come on.
Bye-bye!
You guys are federal marshals?
If we're not,
we'd better give these fuckers back.
Good morning.
Not for them it isn't.
'Morning. Vegas Homicide.
What do you got, Vegas?
No IDs.
Looks like this one was digging,
trying to bury the one in the sheet.
Someone drilled them from the front.
Double taps to the heart.
Three spent .45 casings,
probably more in the sand.
And this is interesting.
.45 slug, slightly deformed.
Vest.
Tell me something, Cybil.
How did that money get up there
in that ceiling?
What do you mean? Jesse put it up there.
It's a little heavy for him
to get up there all by himself.
You're so paranoid.
Yeah, I'm paranoid, because I think
you tried to steal my money.
You don't deserve the money, anyway.
You're just an amateur.
If you're such a pro, you know stealing it
wouldn't have done you any good.
The money is marked,
Miss l-Got-lt-All-Figured-Out.
-You're lying.
-Am l?
The news said the money was untraceable.
-The news?
-And the news doesn't lie.
I'm sure they said that.
That way, when the idiots who stole it
try to spend it, they get caught.
You want to know why, Cybil with a "C"?
Because they were dumb shits
and they listened to the news.
-I never thought about it that way.
-I guess not.
All right, here we go. I'm pulling off here.
I can't drive anymore. I got to sleep.
Can I help you?
Can you pump gas?
Good, because nobody does anymore.
Fill it up.
You all be cool now.
Man, what happened to your nose?
What happened to your hair?
We just came from another interrogation.
Which reminds me.
Quig, why do they call it a head-butt?
It's not like I knocked that prick out
by slamming my forehead into his ass.
Yeah, that's true.
I would have come forward sooner...
...but I was busy getting my beak mended.
I heard about the robbery after the surgery.
I put two and two together and here I am,
in the flesh.
-I'll tell you what I told them other guys.
-Which is what?
I knew one of them.
You're certain of that?
He's a real crazy motherfucker, too.
He was...
...sinister, you know?
Some creepy, freaky, level9 type shit.
Dark.
Kind that's liable to shove a little snake
up the coochies of women.
Yeah, you better watch out for that one.
Wherever he go, trouble bound to follow.
Oh, my God! Is he dead?
Jumper cables might help.
Did it hurt?
That's a funny question.
Well, did it?
I think maybe the first one did.
I could call the cops, you know.
You could try.
Allow me.
Need some spot welding done?
This guy you seem to know so well:
-He's a real Elvis impersonator?
-No.
-What does that mean?
-Remember when the King died in '77?
Jesus, was it '77?
He had a clause in his will
which stated that Lisa Marie...
...along with any illegitimate child
he may have fathered...
...be entitled to his entire estate.
-Naturally.
-That's when I first met him.
Did "him" have a name?
Yeah! Murphy.
Thomas Murphy.
Where are you headed?
Can I come?
Can l?
Go get your bubble gum.
-Smoke?
-No.
But I do everything else.
It's a nasty habit.
Our music, rock'n 'rollmusic
is basically gospel or rhythm blues.
I did not try to steal your money!
