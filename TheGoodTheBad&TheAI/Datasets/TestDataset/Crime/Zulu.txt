Nope.

I hope you're telling me the truth.
You don't know how to control your men?
Lets chat.
This new Tik, "Cam", I said:
only the kids in the townships get it.
This son of a bitch Stan
thought he could overtake me.
Welcome to you.
Hi Rasta.
Stan , you can not
spend your life being afraid.
You see my friend here?
Repeat it all.
Everything you told me.
Everything!
The cops on the beach
what did they want?
What? I can't hear you.
They were looking for me.
Because of the Cam?
The girl.
What girl?
White girl. The daughter of the rugby coach.
The botanical gardens girl?
You knew her?
I had sold her Cam.
We slept together.
And you killed her, asshole?
- That night, she blew her lid.
- You'd taken Tik?
Both of us...
She had too much.
She wanted to get high.
And we started to kiss,
but then it started to kick in.
She scratched me.
And went real crazy!
She crushed my balls.
I freaked out.
Who was that?
The guy who pays you.
Don't worry about it.
We must clean the house from the beach.
And this son of a bitch now?
Keep it cool.
He can still serve us.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Shut up!
He got where it hurts!
You'll never be a man,
small Zulu!
Let's hear you!
There you are.
Yes, good job. Thank you very much.
Good morning.
The kid that went in there...
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.
- Did you tell the police?
- What?
That the kids disappeared.
We must tell them!
Excuse me, but the police couldn't
care less about those street kids.
Oh, that's my son, that's my...
Not to search any township.
- Have a good trip?
- Miserable.
Five hours late. The airport
in Zurich was under the snow.
But it was worth it.
They are very interested.
- How?
- 40.
To health.
Once the trunks
are in Zurich...
We must act quickly.
One of the cops found the house.
You had everything cleaned?
Ya.
In 2 or 3 days, everything will be finished.
In the meantime, we will throw the cops
a bone.
Don't leave it to chance.
You can not...
Shut up!
I read what Stan
did to your friend.
Don't tell me you know how to read.
I have daughters
who taught me.
We leave tonight.
I need you clean everything.
And don't forget
about the pigs.
Do not worry,
I am a true Zulu.
I know.
Where?
Do not forget that I, too,
I am Zulu.
As much as you !
I know.
I know.
Hello. What are you doing here,
old woman?
Have you seen?
And you?
You are not a nigga that will scare me.
