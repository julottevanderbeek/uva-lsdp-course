KELLY: Come on, Doc.
REPORTER:
Now, as I indicated,
she was found shortly before midnight.
We know that she made apparently
a 911 call to police...
Rich, remember Cara?
RICHARD: Nice to see you.
CARA: Nice to see you.
RICHARD: Straighten that arm
or you're gonna slice.
PAUL: Golf pro teach you that?
RICHARD: My wife.
CHARLES: Before I forget...
...thanks for the loaner.
Keys are downstairs.
RICHARD: Any gas in it?
CHARLES: Yes. Enough.
Alec, Richard Kimble.
RICHARD: How are you?
ALEC: Dr. Kimble!
RICHARD: Knock it off!
There's nothing to see here.
And you, come with me.
Thank you.
I was just down to my last joke.
RICHARD:
Thanks, honey.
I know you hate these things,
but God, I love looking at you in a tux.
I feel I look like a waiter or something.
-
- Yes, it is.
Call him back and tell him
I'll be right there.
Thank you. Good night.
I'll wait up for you.

RICHARD: Give me a clamp.
RICHARD:
ROSETTl:
Co-workers, hospital staff, anyone?
No.
KELLY:
...phone calls, people hanging up?
Maybe people coming to the door?
Tradespeople?
Not that I know of.
Back to this fight
with this guy with one arm.
Did it happen upstairs or downstairs?
Upstairs.
And he had which? A right or a left arm?
With a gimmick on it?
Right arm.
Is it one of those with the hooks, or...
No, he had a cosmetic hand.
The security system in your house,
it's a pretty good one.
KELLY:
Our maid.
She knows the code and has a key.
Those scratches on your neck...
...did the one-armed guy do that?
Helen scratched me
when I was trying to move her.
Before or after you had the fight
with the one-armed man?
I told you.
You own a gun, Doc?
Do you own a gun?
Yes, we have a gun in the house.
Is it registered in your name?
RICHARD:
ROSETTl:
ROSETTl:
RICHARD:
RICHARD:
ROSETTl:
His fingerprints are all over the lamp...
...the gun and the bullets...
...and the good doctor's skin
is under her fingernails.
KELLY:
Helen comes from a wealthy family, yes.
Is she insured?
Yes, she is.
ROSETTl:
I am.
The sole beneficiary?
Yes.
KELLY:
I mean, she was worth
quite a bit of money.
Are you suggesting that I killed my wife?
You're saying that I crushed
her skull and shot her.
RICHARD:
When I came home,
there was a man in my house.
I fought with this man.
KELLY:
RICHARD: He had a mechanical arm.
ROSETTl: Plastic? Rubber?
RICHARD: You find this man!
You find this man!
ROSETTl:
He took everything from me.
Oh, Jesus.
ROSETTl:
RICHARD: Oh, God!
ROSETTl:
ROSETTl:
ROSETTl:
Book him.
PROSECUTOR:
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
...you will hear iron-clad proof
of Richard Kimble's guilt.
PROSECUTOR:
...Richard Kimble did in fact viciously...
...attack...
...and brutally murder his wife.
But you'll hear more than that.
You will hear a voice from the grave.
The voice of Helen Kimble
identifying her killer...
...tell us what you observed at the home
of the victim on the night of the murder.
No forcible entry was found.
KELLY:
Honey, I'm home.
RICHARD:
His prints were on the gun and bullets.
FORENSIC EXPERT:
Mrs. Kimble's skull fracture caused
a massive hemorrhage to the brain.
It took less than 5 minutes for her to die.
Your Honor, we would ask to play
Helen Kimble's 911 emergency call...

Let's go, gentlemen.

GUARD 2: He's foaming at the mouth.
GUARD 1:
He's choking!
Wait!
Oh, shit!
Kimble!
Kimble, get over here.
You're a doctor, do something!
Unlock me!
Unlock me!
You'll be okay.
What the hell is that?
GUARD 1:
Help me!
The hell with you.
Help me with this man!
COPELAND:
Now you listen.
Just don't follow me. You got that?
Yeah.
Be good.
My, my, my.
What a mess.
It's a circus.
COSMO:
SAM:
The first engine uncoupled,
and the train jumped the track.
About 100 yards?
You must get new boots.
COSMO: I told you not to wear the heels.
Wear two coats.
POOLE: Next train wreck.
Why do we always mother her?
COSMO: Because she loves us.
BIGGS:
SAM:
TROOPER: Hold it, sir.
Hi. Who's in charge?
Sheriff Rollins.
Just follow the TV lights.
SAM: Sheriff Rogers.
ALL: Rollins!
Look down there and take Newman.
BIGGS: Come on, Noah.
Time to go to work.
GUARD 1:
Somehow I grabbed him
and pushed him out of the bus.
You're brave, you could've been killed.
GUARD 1: I know.
He's my partner.
He would have done the same for me.
Excuse me, I'm Deputy U.S. Marshal
Samuel Gerard, I'd like to...
I'll be with you in just a minute.
ROLLINS:
...these three are dead.
And this one?
Everything happened so fast.
I don't think he made it.
You came a long way for nothing.
With all due respect, Sheriff Rollins...
...I'd like to recommend
checkpoints on a 15-mile radius...
...at l-57, l-24 and over here on Route 13...
Wait. The prisoners are all dead.
Checkpoints will get a lot of people frantic
and they'll flood my office with calls.
Well, shit, I'd hate to see that happen...
...so I'll take over your investigation.
On what authority?
The governor...
...the U.S. Marshal's Office...
...5th District, Northern Illinois.
All right, you want jurisdiction
over this mess. You got it.
Okay, boys, gather around and listen up.
We're shutting it down.
Wyatt Earp is here to mop up...
That's very funny, Wyatt Earp.
BIGGS:
Look here!
We're always fascinated when
we find leg irons with no legs in them.
Who held the key, sir?
Me.
Where're those keys at?
I don't know.
Care to revise your statement, sir?
What?
Do you want to change
your bullshit story, sir?
GUARD 1: He might've got out.
SAM: He might've got out.
You said he was part of the wreckage!
SAM: Set up operations by the fire truck.
Listen, everyone!
A fugitive has been on the run
for 90 minutes.
Average foot speed over uneven ground,
barring injury, is four miles an hour.
That gives us a radius of six miles.
What I want out of each and everyone
of you is a hard target search of every...
...residence, warehouse, farmhouse,
hen house, outhouse...
Checkpoints go up at 15 miles.
Your fugitive's name is Dr. Richard Kimble.
Go get him.
COSMO:
Stevens, it's Cosmo.
COSMO: I'll have a satellite
telephone hookup in two seconds.
Chester Police just found a blood trail...
...two miles southwest.
Match that blood against the prisoners'.
BIGGS: Right.
Renfro, get a fax I.D. On Kimble
to every local hospital.
And follow that with troopers.
Newman?
- Yeah?
- What are you doing?
I'm thinking.
Think me up some coffee
and a doughnut with sprinkles on top...
...while you're thinking.
RESCUE WORKER:
SAM:
RESCUE WORKER: Come on. Hang in
there, brother. We'll get you out of here.
RESCUE WORKER 2:
Is this what you want?
That's it.
I'm going to make some copies.
Good morning, Mr. Johnson.
I have your breakfast for you.
We're thirsty today, aren't we?
NURSE:
It really does get dry in here, doesn't it?
NURSE:
NURSE:
You need your strength.
Doc, we're looking for a prisoner
from that wreck. He might be hurt.
What does he look like?
Six-one, 180, brown hair,
brown eyes, beard.
OFFICER:
Every time I look in the mirror, pal.
Except for the beard, of course.
OFFICER:
Yeah?
Thanks.
RICHARD: I'll give you a hand.
TECHNICIAN:
It's...
How is he doing?
Tell those attending he's got a puncture
in the upper gastric area.
How could he tell that
by looking at his face?
Background just came in from Chicago.
SAM: About time. What've we got?
"Richard Davis Kimble, vascular surgeon."
What the hell is that?
POOLE: Somebody that makes
more money than you.
"Convicted of first-degree murder
of his wife.
"Pleaded innocent."
Says a one-armed man did it.
POOLE: Lots of friends.
Doctors, hospital staff.
We'll start there. I want phone taps.
First, his lawyer.
You'll never going to get that.
Call Judge Rubin.
Tell him I want phone taps.
Why'd you yell at me?
I'll tell him who if I'm in a good mood.
COSMO: Why not yell at her sometimes?
We got a call from the hospital.
The wounded guard swears
he saw Kimble there.
That's hot.
And an ambulance is missing.
Where the hell is he going
in an ambulance?
Ambulance just spotted...
...two miles west of Doverville,
heading north, State Highway 53.
COSMO: Running out of map!
Get your maps out, Renfro.
Check, sound check. Get your maps out.
I want to know all routes
in and out of that town.
We're headed north on Route13,
toward the Barkley Dam.
Son of a bitch!
Don't lose that ambulance.
Visual location of an ambulance headed
north on Route 13 toward Barkley Dam.
We'll pass through a viaduct.
Get on the horn. Bring Biggs and Newman
in from the south side of the viaduct.
He's hauling ass.
Is there a tunnel between here and there?
We have Biggs and Newman?
Look on your map
to know how to get there.
We got him!
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!
MAN: What's going on?
SAM: Get back in your car, sir!
BIGGS:
Put a light in there!
SAM: Put a light in there!
SAM:
BIGGS: I got nothing.
SAM: What do you got?
BIGGS: You gotta be kidding me!
BIGGS: You gotta be kidding me!
SAM: Ah, shit!
COSMO:
We got a gopher.
COSMO: Shit! I just bought these shoes.
SAM:
BIGGS: Which way, Sam?
I didn't kill my wife!
I don't care!
Put that gun down!
SAM:
SAM:
Hands up!
Over your head!
SAM:
Richard, do you want to get shot?
Pay attention!
Get down on your knees!
COSMO: Sam!
No!
What happened? Where'd he go?
He did a Peter Pan right here off this dam!
SAM: Right here!
Down! Boom!
Holy shit!
Can we go home now?
No.
Holy shit!
SAM: There's no way out of here!
BIGGS:
BIGGS: Go up the stairs! Up, up!
SAM: Have that water turned off.
Come over here.
Put two patrol cars on that bridge
down there, four patrolmen.
SAM: Have them glass this river
upstream and down.
I want a helicopter 100 feet off this river.
Make him aware of these wires.
Are you out of your mind? He's dead!
That'll make him easy to catch.
I want hounds on both banks
of this river for two miles...
...upstream and downstream.
You've got a search-and-rescue team?
Get them down here and drag
the bottom of this spillway.
Why isn't the water turned off?
POOLE:
Somebody from County's working on it.
COSMO:
SAM: We're out of here!
TROOPER:
I don't think there's anything to find.
SAM: Find it anyway. You've got lights
and generators coming tonight.
TROOPER: I won't tell you
how to do your job...
SAM: Put the helicopter on the bridge!
...but only one person in a million could
survive that fall. The guy is fish food!
Get a cane pole.
Go catch the fish that ate him.
SAM:
RICHARD:
We can't find the guy.
GUTHRIE:
RICHARD:
RICHARD:
COSMO:
They'll continue the search into the night.
Good. Call Kentucky
and thank them for the dogs.
Remember, opera ain't over
until the Big Dog howls.
Need a ride?
BIGGS:
All right, we got him. He shacked up
with some babe over in Whiting.
POOLE: She left work tonight
and took him home.
NEWMAN: About two hours ago,
her boss said.
BIGGS: They spotted her car
outside her house.
Does she run with anyone?
No one we could find. No family either.
Tell the police not to move till we get
there. We'll go first thing in the morning.
Your cousin still got his truck?
Call him. Tell him we need it.
SAM: Be drunk, Newman.
BIGGS:
HENRY:
SAM: Newman, I don't want you
getting lost. You stick with me.
U.S. Marshals! Everybody down!
Hold it right there! Show me those hands!
Keep them up!
COPELAND: Get your ass in there.
COPELAND:
WOMAN:
COPELAND:
I got your man!
COPELAND:
Do you hear me?
I want out of here!
COPELAND:
NEWMAN: Yes, we can.
COPELAND: Shut up! Shut up!
NEWMAN: I'm listening.
COPELAND:
I just want a car out front.
Don't shoot.
SAM:
Shut up!
I can't hear anything. My ear is...
I can't believe you did that.
You think I should've bargained
with that guy.
Yeah.
I do.
You could have missed.
You could have killed me.
How bad is that ear?
Terrible. I'll have permanent damage.
Let me see it.
Come here.
Can you hear what I'm saying now?
Yeah.
I don't...
...bargain.
You hear that?
Yeah.
Good.
Walter, this is Richard.
I wasn't worried about appearances,
Walter.
I won't surrender. I need help, money.
You're asking me to harbor and aid a
convicted felon. I can't help you that way.
St. Louis.
Mr. Copeland was a bad man.
He was going to kill one of my kids.
Well, sir, you can blame me.
I'm the one that shot him.
WALTER ON TAPE:
RICHARD ON TAPE:
So he's not dead.
Let that be a lesson to you.
Don't ever argue with the Big Dog.
Big Dog is always right.
POOLE: Yeah, you been right before.
RICHARD ON TAPE:
WALTER ON TAPE:
RICHARD ON TAPE:
WALTER ON TAPE:
RICHARD ON TAPE:
I might be crazy,
but that train sounds like an EI.
St. Louis doesn't have one.
How do you know it's an elevated train?
I lived under an El for 20 years.
Explain the difference between the sound
of an El and a train on the ground.
You must have ears like an eagle.
Play that back.
I want to hear the sound of an EI.
What cities have Els?
New York has got an EI.
POOLE: Philly.
BIGGS: We do.
Milwaukee has got an EI.
Hold it! Where the lawyer says he's guilty.
There's a bell in the background.
There's a guy on a P.A.
Can you drop everything but him?
I'll try. Hold on.
Right there.
What's he saying?
Sounds like, "Next stop." Do that again!
"Next stop..."
"Merchandise Mart."
Son of a bitch! Our boy came home.
That bell is on the Wells Street bridge,
six blocks away.
I knew it was an EI.
Yeah, Big Dog. You're never wrong.
BIGGS: I'll call the C.P.D.
POOLE: This is his Chicago file.
Sammy, when I die,
I want to come back just like you.
Happy and handsome?
STEVENS: I'll notify the press.
SAM:
STEVENS: Right, no press.
CHARLES: Hi, Billy.
BILLY: How's it going, sir?
CHARLES: Good, and you?
BILLY: All right.
CHARLES: Here you go, Billy.
BILLY: Have a good one, sir.
Spare change? Dollar, mister?
No, thank you very much. I don't want it.
Oh, my God. Richard!
How are you, Charlie?
CHARLES:
I need some money.
Sure, sure. Get in.
No, I can't. Just whatever you got on you.
You're hot, pal. If not now, you will be.
Have you got a place to stay?
I mean, how can I help you?
COP: You've got a green light. Move on!
I'll call you.
SAM:
He did it for the money.
For the money? He's a doctor.
He's already rich.
She was more rich.
Is this the entire
Chicago Police Department file?
KELLY: That's everything.
SAM: I want to do all the interviews again.
The list of hospital staff is it in the file?
Sure is.
Thank you.
You don't want to use the media?
We want him to relax. Make himself
comfortable. Try to re-enter his life.
Here's the apartment.
You can see here is heater.
You will have warm.
Here is kitchen. Sink.
Is nice bed.
Plenty space.
You can look at.
LANDLADY:
It's okay with you?
It's perfect.
KELLY:
You all know in what high regard
we hold this scumbag.
So I'm personally donating
a bottle of 12-year-old Scotch...
...to whoever puts the collar on this quack.
Dick Rosetti is passing out bulletins.
NURSE: Help you?
RICHARD:
SAM: You went
to medical school together?
Yes, we did.
SAM:
You know Morton Feinberg?
CHARLES: I do.
SAM:
When did you see him last?
CHARLES:
I saw Richard this morning.
COSMO: You saw him this morning?
CHARLES:
Where was this?
Outside my tennis club.
Did he ask for help?
I volunteered. He wouldn't accept that.
How much did you give him?
Couple of bucks. Just what I had on me.
COSMO: He won't get far on that.
SAM: Why'd he come back to Chicago?
He didn't tell me that, sir.
I'm sure he's trying to protect you
from having to lie for him, but...
Dr. Nichols...
You really want to be
his friend and help him?
Help us bring him in unharmed.
Why?
So he can go back to prison?
If you want help, gentlemen,
you've come to the wrong man.
Richard is innocent.
You'll never find him. He's too smart.
BIGGS: We're some smart guys.
What about us? We're smart. We are.
How smart could he be, really?
Is he as smart as you are?
Smarter.
SURGEON:
SURGEON:
SAM: How long have you known Kimble?
SURGEON: 10 years. Since I've been here.
What kind of medicine did he practice
here at the hospital?
I want you to know that
I believe Kimble to be innocent.
Would he come to you for help?
If he came to me, I would help.
But he wouldn't come to me.
That's not his style.
COSMO:
COSMO: If I fell down these stairs,
I'd be a goner. I'd be dead.
COSMO: What a waste!

About 10:30 in the morning.
KELLY: And he was alone?
KID:
ROSETTl: You got a good look at him?
KID:
You better be straight with me.
This is the guy staying

That's what I'm telling you.
NURSE: Just breathe. Stay calm.
I need a doctor over here!
ATTENDANT:
