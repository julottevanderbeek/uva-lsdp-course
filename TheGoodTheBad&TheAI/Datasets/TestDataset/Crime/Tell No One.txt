TELL NO ONE
You guys free next weekend?
I told you we'd wake her.
Let me hold her!
You want a cuddle with Alex?
Give her the pacifier.
Non-peacefully, even?
The country, what a drag...
I think he's ready!
After 9 years of med school,
a kid's the last thing he needs!
Why not?
They annoying you?
You feed her exhaust fumes
all day long!
No worries, I know what she likes.
Wrap the blanket round her.
François! François!
Daddy! Daddy!
Let's go.
Stop that!
Looks good.
- Did you call your sister back?
- No.
Why are you being like this with her?
Like what?
I don't know.
Last night, you totally ignored her.
- Because she won't sell the farm?
- It's crazy!
It costs us a fortune.
She doesn't even want to live there.
You think your dad
would've wanted to sell?
That's irrelevant.
She's a rider not a manager.
Who'll run the stables?
I don't have time.
- Don't get mad.
- I'm not.
You always take her side.
You're right. I'll butt out.
Margot, it's not that.
Look, I'm sorry.
I'll let the dog out.
I'm sorry!
Margot?
Alex!
Okay...
I think I've seen enough
to contradict your family doctor.
We'll take her off cortisone.
It won't cure her eczema.
What will help her...
is if you let your child
enjoy her life.
Get off me!
You know what I would suggest
when she doesn't have school?
Cartoons in bed,
fries for lunch.
Friends to visit
all afternoon, and Barbie,
chocolate and the whole shebang!
Call him, I said!
And lots of TV, of course.
Excuse me.
Let go of me!
Let go of me or I'll pop you!
- Call him!
- Calm down...
Get lost!
Who the hell are you?
Get lost, I said!
- Calm down.
- He hit me!
Bruno, what's wrong?
He fell off the couch!
I told them to call you!
I called ER first!
- He's your patient?
- For 3 years. Hemophiliac.
Bruno, give them your son.
- No, why isn't it you?
- It's not my unit.
Fuck that! I want you.
Nobody touches my boy!
Nobody touches my boy!
Okay, Bruno.
Your son probably
has internal bleeding.
Give him to me.
I'll take him in if you want.
Stand back!
What you staring at?
Shit, that's good!
Julie, show Mr. Rossignon to table 9.
- I love lunch with you.
- Sorry.
Summer's usually quiet
but we're overrun by tourists.
I'll have the sole
and turn the air-con up, it's sweltering.
You got plans tomorrow?
I promised Margot's mom I'd stop by.
Alex, don't you think it's...
It's been 8 years!
I'm not saying turn the page,
but I don't see why you always
celebrate this morbid anniversary.
Celebrate?
Whatever...
You've nothing to say to them.
You see them once a year
to commemorate her death.
I'm sorry...
It's just I thought
we'd spend the evening together.
I'll come by after.
If you shut me out,
you'll shut everyone out.
Talk to me, okay?
How you doing?
Going nuts,
sitting doing nothing.
I can imagine.
Unfortunately, it's the only option.
They'll call you
when the operation's over.
Now, you're here,
I'll take a walk.
Call me if there's news.
Sure.
Thanks.
What? Take it back.
You'd prefer a DVD player?
Plasma TV? A sweet plasma?
I don't want anything.
Take it back.
I'll call you.
A problem?
Not at all. Show her in.
Rambouillet police called.
Sergeant Lavelle.
He said it was urgent.
What are you staring at?
I love watching you ride.
- Come more often then.
- Yeah, I should.
I'll be right there.
Excuse me.
Can you tell me when you went
to Lake Charmaine last?
I was down there last year.
Doctor?
Like I told your brother on the phone,
workmen laying pipes
dug up 2 bodies near the lake.
She heard it on the radio.
Yes, the press caught us
with our guard down.
- You've identified them?
- No, we're running tests.
All we have is
shot dead over 5 years ago.
You said the bodies weren't on our land.
So why speak to us?
I'm getting to that.
We may have to excavate farther,
so I'd need permission to...
You have it.
- Anne?
- Of course.
- You need a signature?
- Yes.
Both your signatures.
Sorry to drag this back up.
I know your wife's killer was tried...
Cut the crap!
You thought I killed her!
You were her husband.
Family members are often...
If not for that,
you might have found her alive!
My colleagues
had to examine every possibility.
Thank you.
I'll need one last thing.
What?
A blood sample for a DNA test.
When your wife was abducted,
you said they hit you...
Yes.
Well, we found a baseball bat
with the bodies,
with traces of blood on it.
B positive.
Just like you.
You are type B positive?
Of course, they could be victims
of Frank Serton,
except serial killers
rarely change their M.O.
Neither body shows signs of torture.
They'd been buried.
There were no animal corpses.
And Serton's victims were all women.
So?
So, it's all a bit fuzzy, Doctor.
Let's talk again when it's not.
That's precisely
why I need your cooperation.
I'll give the sample,
but I told you all I knew back then.
Yes, I read your statement.
Your wife screams...
You get hit, fall in the water.
Wake up in the hospital.
And the rest is still a blank.
We bought that version.
But if it is your blood,
the discovery of these 2 bodies
means we'll reopen the investigation.
I'll get it.
We'll try to get some answers
to all those questions,
like why were you found
unconscious on the dock?
Who made the anonymous 911 call?
And above all...
How did you get out of the water
when unconscious?
Ms. Vigne is a nurse.
She'll take your blood sample.
I thought you'd prefer...
to do it right here.
Céline, I'm not taking calls.
Are you seeing anyone?
I'm sorry, Alex.
You don't have to tell me,
it's none of my business.
There's no one.
I mean, nothing serious.
Alexandre...
We all miss her so much.
But you have a life to live.
Don't feel guilty
about seeing other people.
I don't.
I mean, it's not that.
I'll check the lamb.
How are you?
Good. And you?
Retirement!
I wake up every morning
and make like...
Drink?
Jacques?
I have an important question for you.
I want to know...
Margot...
What did she look like when you found her?
What?
I keep thinking about it.
Maybe it's the anniversary...
I need to know.
I never asked you for details.
Was she beaten?
Why are you doing this?
I really need to know.
There were bruises, yes.
Where?
On her face?
Yes.
- Her body, too?
- I didn't see her body.
I was there as her dad not a cop,
to ID her.
Did you identify her easily?
Easily?
You said her face was bruised.
Screw you and your questions!
If you could please identify the body?
Her jaw was dislocated,
tendons ripped out...
I'd like you to leave.
Already?
- They kick you out?
- Yeah.
To conclude this tribute,
I'd like you to applaud
the President of the Children's Trust
organizer of tonight's show
in memory of his son,
he's going to lead the riders out.
Please give a warm welcome
to state senator...
Gilbert Neuville!
Four short strides. It's tight.
So at 8:15 tomorrow,
you get another message, right?
Right.
Where's that?
Don't know.
Not in France, it's still light.
How can you think it's her?
You can't see shit.
Don't go there, Alex.
It'll drive you insane.
I know.
How did it go?
I placed second!
- Bed for me. I'm wiped out.
- I was just leaving.
You want some food, sweets?
It's nothing. We had a fight.
She thinks I'm banging
one of the waitresses.
Lose that and get back to the emails.
You knew the 2 guys at the lake?
Show me the other.
Same sender?
Anonymous. Who knows?
I do. It's the same person.
You tried the passwords?
The account doesn't exist.
The sender will set it up at 8:15.
I'm hooked up to both his computers.
As soon as he's online, we'll know.
I think I know enough already.
Dr. Beck?
Detective Meynard,
Versailles police.
Can you follow me?
What's going on?
Excuse me a second.
- Where'd you go?
- Wash my hands.
Captain Eric Levkowich,
Versailles PD.
What's all this about?
It'll be easier to talk at the office.
Mr. Beck...
Who is Juliette Langlois?
Will you stop that?
Does the name Juliette Langlois
mean anything to you?
Juliette is my wife's middle name.
And your middle name?
Arnaud.
So let's imagine that I ask you
if the name...
Arnaud Ripper
means something to you.
You'd say,
"Actually, Arnaud's my middle name"?
My wife grew up on Rue Langlois.
That's why I said
it was her middle name.
It reminded me of her.
Did your wife ever use that name?
In what way?
"Hello, I'm Juliette Langlois,
I booked a room..."
Or to get an ID with that name, see?
No, it was a game we played
when we were kids.
Did you ever beat up your wife?
Let me repeat the question.
Did you ever beat up your wife?
What's wrong with you?
Slapping your wife's no crime.
Pretty natural even, huh?
No, it's not natural!
I never beat up my wife.
Are you listening to me?
You think I did that?
I promised your friend Hélène
I'd help you, but I need you
to tell me all you can, clear?
The car accident story...
Is it true?
Of course, it's true.
Were you with her?
I was doing my internship in Bordeaux.
- I'm warning you. They'll check.
- Let them.
I know what I'm saying.
Maybe she took the photos
for the insurance. Seems logical.
No idea. I never saw them before.
Are you forgetting anything?
No.
What happens now?
for a wife-beating charge. This stinks.
Okay, go for it.
Love it!
Now, let's get a little wild.
This is really good.
Hold the duck in front of you,
like it's your thingy.
Your tongue out
like you're gonna lick it.
That's great!
Fred!
And again! More tongue!
Love it!
Hold on...
I don't get it.
You came to ask me that?
That's all you have to say?
I'm sorry.
I don't give a shit about sorry!
That's not the problem.
I was grieving too, you know.
I needed you there.
You never called.
You never took my calls.
I couldn't.
I swear...
I couldn't face calling you.
I thought I'd pull through alone.
But I just went under.
Tell me what happened.
I don't know.
Weren't you with her?
One evening, she came by
covered in bruises all over.
She said she'd had a car accident.
If anybody asked, I was to say
we'd been together in my car.
If anybody asked?
I think she meant you.
She wouldn't tell me anything else.
Nothing, honestly.
- You took photos?
- Of?
Her. Her injuries.
Why would I do that?
No reason.
What's wrong?
I've no idea.
She was my best friend.
Look at me, please.
I swear she never lied to you.
It was the only time.
You gotta believe me.
May I to speak to Mr. Ferrault, please?
We found no trace of an accident...
in either the insurance
or police records.
Alex never hit Margot.
He couldn't have.
Can you leave us alone?
Captain...
If your son-in-law
decided to kill your daughter...
He loved her, why'd he wanna do that?
For 200,000 euros.
Her life insurance policy.
That's absurd!
With all the holes in the official story,
compare it to this...
Beck drives her to an isolated locale
where there'll be no witnesses.
There,
the two guys we found last week
kidnap and kill her.
Serton's on the loose.
It's in all the papers.
They make it look like
she's one of Serton's victims.
With dead cats and dogs all round.
Easy as that. He takes the rap.
Serton confessed to 7 murders,
not your daughter's.
This is ridiculous.
Alex was assaulted.
He was in a coma for 3 days.
He had to get hurt.
How'd he explain a couple scratches?
He was on the shore.
How'd he get out of the water?
All the doctors who saw his file
say it's impossible.
Didn't that ever intrigue you?
Who gave you those?
In some way,
I'd say it was your daughter.
We found a key
on one of the 2 corpses.
To your daughter's safety-deposit box.
Box 174.
Registered to one
Juliette Langlois.
Her middle name
and this street name.
The photos were inside.
Your son-in-law said he never saw them.
Why would she hide them from him?
You talked to Alex?
- What else did he say?
- Nothing.
He left with a lawyer.
Not just any lawyer.
Elisabeth Feldman.
That sound like an innocent man?
Stop it now, that's enough.
It's impossible.
It's the cops,
trying to manipulate you.
They can do anything with computers.
She looked older.
Age progression software.
They use it for missing kids.
Mommy!
If they think I killed her,
why send me emails
as if she's still alive?
Think about it.
To get me to confess, it sucks.
If I killed her,
I know it's a trap.
- Alex, not now!
- It doesn't make sense.
If they wanna trap me, send me
emails from a guy who saw me kill her.
You see?
If daddy says yes,
we'll go this weekend.
C'mon, sweetheart,
it's time to sleep now
and don't give her a hard time.
Sleep well, princess.
Where's Margot?
I asked you a question.
Nina!
Go away! Basket!
Cut it out!
Fuck it!
Hold on, let me try.
I've been trying for half an hour!
It doesn't work.
Nothing works!
Fucking thing!
What's that up there?
What is it?
It means you're connected
to another computer.
And?
And I only have one computer here.
Someone's connected to my computer.
They're watching me.
Fuck it!
Okay...
The Basque.
The chick's bailed and Beck's out
walking his dog.
He'll keep in touch.
She told us all she knows.
Let's go.
Hit the lights.
You asshole!
C'mon, Nina!
You can't bring a dog in.
You were first.
Number 15.
was brought here.
She was one of Serton's victims.
Frank Serton...
Yes?
Did you do the autopsy?
Yes.
Do you photograph the corpses?
Yes, we do.
So you photographed my wife's autopsy?
- Most likely.
- I'd like to see them.
I don't have them here.
The case is closed.
But I can see the report?
Sure, but not today.
You have to request to see it.
There are forms, a procedure.
Okay, I'm making the request.
Capt. Barthas, Crime Squad.
My partner's here with the witnesses.
In the kitchen.
He was the last person you saw?
Yes.
- What time was it?
- I don't know. Around 2 p.m.
She introduce you?
She tell you his name?
Alexandre Beck.
- We found this.
- Where?
A trash can downstairs.
He's going down.
It was a pleasure working with you.
Not now. No can do.
Barthas for Levkowich.
The beltway!
Round the other side!
Four, that way!
Vincent, go with them!
Hello, Bruno?
Not at all.
In fact, he got in early today.
Did he seem at all nervous?
Nobody mention anything?
