No more.
- Is that supposed to scare me?
- Don't be a wise-ass.
Just take it easy. Commander Farrell
is trying to lay it out for us.
Why don't you just knock it off?
How did you actually meet
the secretary of defense?
I was introduced to him by Pritchard.
I met him when I was in college.
- Pritchard?
- Yeah, Scott Pritchard. Jesus.
General counsel for the secretary of
defense. Got it? You know this already.
When's he gonna come out
from behind here?
Good evening, sir.
Lucky it's not a bullshit detector,
else none of us would get in.
- How are you, Scott?
- Tom. How are you?
- Fine.
- You look great.
Thank you for the invitation. I'm not
used to hanging out in places like this.
But I suspect you'd like to.
I take it you'd like to join our staff.
That was the purpose of
the note, wasn't it?
It wasn't a note. It was a Christmas card,
and the message was Merry Christmas.
David, Scott is here.
Come on.
I want to introduce you to someone.
- Scott, how nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.
- Scott.
- Hello.
Secretary Brice, Commander Farrell -
the officer I mentioned.
He's had eXperience on the joint staff
and naval intelligence.
Everyone I know is looking forward
to serving under you for another term.
You must have
a limited acquaintanceship.
- Tom and I were at college together.
- Good.
He has great warmth!
- He's a genius.
- Oh?
The normal rules don't apply.
You know, some people think
you're really the brains.
Do they?
Is that supposed to flatter me? He's the
most eXtraordinary person I've ever met.
If it came to it,
I'd lay down my life for him.
Is that a job requirement?
Ladies and gentlemen,
it was fantastic having the President here.
I'm sure you'll agree
we can look forward to a fine four years.
So let's keep our inaugural hair down
with some more music.
Let's do it right now.
EXcuse me, do you have a light?
If you wanna look down my dress,
you should grow a few inches.
- Wanna dance?
- The twist?
No, thank you.
- Well, we don't have to twist.
- "No" meant "no".
- "No" wasn't a figure of speech?
- No.
- You're pretty impressed with me.
- No.
Yes, you are.
Stoli, straight up.
So I was impressed.
- Want a drink?
- Same.
Make it two.
Are you one of them?
- One of who?
- These hypocrites, all fat and shiny,
gearing up for another four years of
ramming it to the rest of us. One of them.
No.
I'll bet you are.
- You're pretty cynical.
- Adequate to the occasion.
We have a potential
nausea situation building here.
Let's get outta here.
My date's not gonna like that much.
But what the hell?
His wife'll be delighted.
Is this something we should talk about?
Nope.
- Where would you like to go?
- Show us the monuments.
- What's your name?
- Bill.
How you doin', Bill?
You wanna shut the slide?
- Sure.
- Sorry, Bill.
My name's Tom.
I'm Susan.
We're here.
- Is this your apartment?
- No. I have a key to my apartment.
- It better be good.
- We need your bed.
Nina, Tom. Tom, Nina.
There's a limousine downstairs, OK?
There's booze,
the refrigerator's full of food...
Susan, why don't you go
to your own place?
Because it's... just one of those things.
Be a friend.
If anybody calls, then just tell them that I
died or that I'm asleep or... He won't call.
- I'll think of something.
- Here are the keys.
- I gotta change into some clothes.
- Everything you need is in the car.
- You didn't do it?!
- You'd better beat it before I get arrested.
- Bye, Nina.
- Nice meeting you, Tom.
Nice to meet you, Nina.
Move it.
- Get outta here.
- OK, asshole.
Hey, come on, folks. Break it up.
I gotta make a living.
Move it along. "The white zone is for
loading and unloading only. No parking."
Take care of yourself.
Send postcards from eXotic ports of call.
That's what you call 'em, isn't it?
EXotic ports of call?
A port's a port.
You're eXotic.
Bye.
Morning, Tommy.
A little bit early to be relieving me.
Well, I felt our motion change.
- Have you set a forward lookout in this?
- Yeah. Standing orders.
You should inform the captain
we're shipping water.
Right! You wanna be the one
to wake him up?
We got a Russian sub out there. We're
supposed to catch up and stay with it.
Great.
- A chance to try out the depth charges.
- That'll be the day.
Uh-huh. The last one.
Forward watch is down, sir.
He's gonna be swept over, sir!
- Put the spot on him.
- Where is he?
There he is. There. Hold on!
Has he got a safety line on?
Tommy! Sound "Away rescue party" now!
Help!
Send the special rescue detail.
Forward lookout down.
- Tommy, wait for the rescue party!
- Send the special rescue detail.
Forward lookout down.
Help me!
Tommy, you don't have a safety line on.
- Keep the light on him.
- I'm trying, sir.
Tommy!
- Keep the light on him.
- It's too windy, sir.
Hold on! Don't let him
out of your sight. Jesus.
Help me.
All right.
He's got him. He's got him!
- You've seen the leak on the budget cuts.
- I've read the papers. You're late.
- I was caught in traffic.
- You should allow for that. I do.
I've red-lined the relevant sections.
My synopsis is at the end.
Order breakfast - most important meal of
the day. You should take care of yourself.
Five years, two billion dollars, and Gulf
Maritime can't even float the prototype.
The Phantom sub is a sinkhole.
I'm not puttin' another dime into it.
You're right, of course, but what about
the armed services committee? Duvall?
One thing I'm looking forward to
is putting that fraud Duvall in his place.
- He's right back there.
- I know.
Let's go.
- Mr Secretary Brice. Good morning, sir.
- Senator, how are you?
- Mr Marshall.
- We've been having a little discussion
about that piece on the budget.
Did you read it, sir?
- I haven't read the papers. Scott told me.
- Ah, Mr Pritchard.
Where in heaven's name
do they get their information?
And that idea about cutting back
on the Phantom sub.
It's groundless.
We were just going over our options.
Mr Marshall tells me those Soviets
are doing things with submarines
that'll turn your hair white.
I have no intention of
making a decision on this
without consulting you first. Good day.
Good day, Senator.
You believe that?
No.
The car, please.
That business with Marshall... If we fight
him, he'll have the CIA on his side.
Of course. He pushed Marshall
for the directorship.
- Sorry. I was short with you. I apologise.
- That's not necessary.
Several months ago you introduced me
to a friend of yours, an officer...
Farrell.
- He has a background in intelligence?
- Two tours with naval intelligence.
We could use a hero.
Get him here, will you?
- His ship's in Manila.
- Just do it, please.
No, no, no.
Come here. You want a real hero. See?
Come on. You know you want to do it.
- Gates, you're an officer.
- You're making it hard on me.
- You're making it hard on me.
- You know what I'm talking about, man.
- You deserve the damn medal.
- I carry?
If you jump me for promotion,
I'll kill you, your family, your pig...
- I carry.
- You carry me?
- No, the bag.
- I speak Filipino. Beat it, kid.
- He's gotta make a living. Don't run.
- He's gonna run.
If you run,
I knock dog doo-doo out of you.
He's running!
John, forget it.
No, let him go, let him go. So what?
He's got a toothbrush
and a pair of skivvies. So what?
OK. So what do we do now?
I don't know.
I thought I'd go buy some ashtrays
and take in some of
the local folk dancing.
- Folk dancing.
- Yeah.
You know, when you only pay
if you talk to the person.
Shut up. No, not you.
No, I will pay,
but first I have to know if she's there.
If I'm going to count out a million pesos,
I need to know if she's there. Yes.
Hey, that's my money.
That's my money. Go get it.
No, I'm not joking. I'm an American.
Hello.
Yes, I'll take it.
I'm putting my money in now.
Susan?
Shut up. Was I just disconnected?
I'm gonna show them...
I'm gonna show them how an American
plants the flag in a foreign fucking land.
Can I get a beer, please?
I'd like another beer.
Wild thing!
You're beautiful.
- Hey, thanks.
- Keep it. Thank you.
Hello, Tom. Welcome back.
I've some mail for you. Come in.
The Philippines a romantic place, huh?
I painted a new painting.
Christmas in New England.
- It's beautiful.
- You really like it?
Well, it's unfinished.
Will you be with us for a while?
Yes, I'll be working
in the Pentagon again. Thank you.
Great. It's always a pleasure
to have you back.
Oh, my God.
Hello.
The Ancient Mariner. Not so ancient.
I'm wasted!
I'm so happy to see you. When did
you get back and why didn't you call me?
- I did call you.
- I wrote you.
But I'm only semiliterate,
so it was wastebasket time.
If you caught gonorrhoea, I'll kill you.
- I'm wearing too many clothes.
- It doesn't feel like anything.
Talk about feeling like
it's not wearing anything...
- You're gonna blush.
- You are a very bad girl.
Hold it.
I mean the blush.
God, I'm so embarrassed.
- What are you doin'?
- I wanna get a picture of this.
- No! No pictures.
- Naval hero blushes. You're proud.
I'm not proud. I'm serious.
Don't take a picture of me.
Come on.
- Give me that.
- You jiggled the camera.
You pervert.
I think I did this way too early.
Looks like a baboon
in a closet at midnight.
Good morning, Mr Pritchard.
Go right in.
- May I take your hat, sir?
- Thank you.
Commander.
- Glad to have you with us.
- Nice to be here. Thank you, sir.
Scott has a very high opinion of you.
- Are you familiar with your new duties?
- No, sir.
Then this meeting is premature.
- Tom only arrived here yesterday, sir.
- Well, since you're here...
You'll function as liaison,
under Scott's supervision,
between this office
and the intelligence community.
Calling those piranhas a community
is one of life's ironies.
You'll meet regularly
with each of the agencies,
but for now I am primarily
concerned with the CIA.
Sir?
- Are you aware of the Phantom sub?
- Yes, sir.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
The Phantom sub is meant to be invisible
to sonar. The builder's first instinct...
I should say his second instinct,
his first being to get his snout as
deeply as possible into the public trough.
Anyway, they wanna build a submarine
roughly the size of an aircraft carrier.
The Russians won't need sonar. They'll
just see this huge bulge out in the ocean.
It's my plan to terminate this programme.
There'll be Congressional resistance,
chiefly from Senator Duvall.
EXcuse me. Scott.
What's worrying
is his connection to the CIA.
We eXpect them to feed him with inflated
estimates of Soviet research in the field.
To counter him, we need access
to the same information.
Not self-serving gloss, but the raw data
they base their conclusions on.
- Your job is to get it.
- Yes, sir.
But raw data from the CIA...
My eXperience at ONl...
They'll either give it to us or they won't.
If they do, then I'm correct.
If they do not, I will use it
against them with the President.
- You realise I speak in complete candour.
- Yes, sir.
Senator Duvall...
Senator Duvall is motivated
by this absurd lust...
Sit down.
This absurd lust for power.
Now, this would be comic
if it wasn't so damn dangerous.
Marshall at the CIA is his...
creature.
You are above this kind of political
unpleasantness. That's why I chose you.
Go with Scott and get to know
the background material.
Let's cut the protocol.
In the absence of a demur,
I'll assume your responses
are in the affirmative.
Lorraine,
get my wife on the phone, please.
I think he likes you.
This is the situation room.
And right this way, sir,
is the computer centre.
Did I mention, sir, that
I'm very pleased to be working for you?
This is a Sperry 90l80.
All the terminals in this room are for it.
It interfaces with the IBM 370s
at NSA headquarters.
It works programs for COM-SEC,
SIGINT, personnel command,
- the bureau of alcohol and fire...
- I get your gist.
- That's the systems analyst. Let me...
- I know who it is. Sam Hesselman.
Good to see you. Why didn't you call
when you got into town?
- I don't know. Why didn't we call?
- Sir?
It's good to see you, Tom.
You look great. Come in the office.
- Mr FoX, take a break.
- Yes, sir.
- Are you back here for good?
- Well, I'm stationed here again.
- How the hell are you?
- Can't complain.
- Helen and the kids ask about you.
- Good.
The kids loved the ashtray.
They didn't know a donkey could do that.
Tom, this is Kevin O'Brien of the CIA. I've
eXplained that you're taking over liaison.
- Kevin will be your contact.
- It's good to meet you.
If there's anything I can do,
let me know.
I'm just getting my feet wet
trying to catch up.
Oh? I assumed that because you didn't
wanna wait until the regular meeting...
I'm certain there are questions
that Commander Farrell must have.
No. I'm not sufficiently prepared.
I wouldn't wanna waste your time.
- Well, gentlemen, if you'll eXcuse me...
- Maybe there is one thing.
The secretary asked me to help him
prepare for the NATO meeting.
I'd like to know
the Russian intelligence estimates.
We submit a report
on the first of the month.
It'd be a big help if you could send
what you have as of now.
- I'll put something together.
- I'd appreciate it.
Don't mention it.
That was deftly handled.
For a moment there I thought...
Just trying to be subtle.
It's my job, isn't it?
- Was this a present?
- Yeah.
- He gave it to me.
- Oh? He has eXpensive taste, this guy.
Didn't cost anything.
Some foreign minister gave it to him.
So in other words we're dealing with
a guy foreign ministers give presents to?
- Don't start that stuff.
- I didn't say anything.
You don't have to say anything.
You never say a word.
I thought I wasn't supposed to.
You know what I mean. You get that
wounded, disapproving look on your face.
Ask me a question and I'll answer it.
It's David Brice, secretary of defense.
Satisfied?
You know I work for Brice?
That makes two of us.
Did you take care of everything?
Yes. I'm supposed to pick Miss Atwell up
at eight... if she remembers.
- You don't approve of Susan, do you?
- Sir?
She's a bright and eXciting woman.
Can't you see that?
Not eXactly, I guess.
All right, I'm a pain in the ass.
But this one can do things for me
like no other woman I've ever met.
It's the only other thing worth living for.
What is the big deal about tonight?
He likes to see me in public.
So what does he get? A secret hard-on?
Try and understand.
- I'll call you later tonight.
- I'll wait by the phone.
- Hello, Scott.
- Miss Atwell.
- Two white wines, please.
- Mr Brice.
Mr Marshall and I have been having
a little debate on government service.
Now, I claim that the fella
with the appointed job -
well, he sorta comes and he goes at
the pleasure of this or that administration.
He sorta blows in the wind,
whereas the elected official,
well, he serves the people directly.
He has to be more responsible.
What do you think, Mr Secretary?
Senator Duvall,
I think it's getting very late.
Thank you.
Who's that man licking Duvall's ear?
I recognise him.
I would hope so. That's Marshall.
He's the director of the CIA.
You would hope so.
No, thank you.
Commander.
- So nice you could make it.
- Thank you, sir.
Ladies and gentlemen...
It's good of you to come and help us
celebrate our national day.
After all, we're a small country, far away.
We've got a little entertainment for you
which I'm sure you're going to enjoy.
I'll be right back.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- You're going away?
- Just for the weekend.
Perhaps a romantic interlude, yes?
Perhaps.
If I intrude on your privacy,
for this I am sorry.
"It's not just a job. It's an adventure."
What are you eating? You're eating bugs?
I gotta have another one.
- There you go.
- That is really disgusting.
I love Tom Farrell.
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.
Hold on.
Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
- I want you to take care of us.
- I will. You guys newlyweds?
- You can go.
Thank you.
You're beautiful.
- Mr and Mrs Smith?
- A romantic gesture.
Very original.
I spelt it with a Y.
- Hi.
- Hey there.
We wanna rent a boat.
That's all right, but we don't want
a plastic toy. We want something like this.
- No, no.
- Why not?
That's my boss's boat. It ain't for rent.
Well, I want it.
Don't do this.
You're bad.
You know what you're doin'? It's gustin'
like a son of a bitch out there. One more.
God, I wish the navy was still like this.
Let's get ready. We'll come about.
- Give me a kiss.
- OK.
We're gonna come over here.
Let me get it off.
- Ready?
- No, not yet.
- OK, whenever you are.
- OK. I'm ready.
- Say "Helm's alee".
- Helm's alee!
- Good.
- Yeah!
Hello.
Oh, hi, Nina.
Tom and I just got back this minute.
OK.
Yeah.
Can I call you later?
Bye.
Well, it didn't take him long, did it?
That was Nina, so don't.
Don't what?
Oh, no. Tom...
David's here. Oh, my God.
I'm begging you.
Just go now out the back door.
- I'm sorry. Just...
- When I go, it'll be through the front door.
As a favour to me, just this one time.
Please. Please go.
I promise I'll work everything out,
all right?
Tom, please.
Why don't you fucking go down
and beg him not to come in?.
You want me to say it? I'll say it.
I'll leave him. I promise I will.
I'll leave him.
I love you.
You've been out of town.
And you have a pleasant flush.
- I got some sun.
- How nice.
- And with whom did you get this sun?
- What?
"What?" I said who were you with
this weekend?
Nobody.
Well, I find that hard to believe,
that you'd go away completely alone.
- I didn't say I was completely alone.
- You said you weren't with anybody.
I mean nobody you know.
I know a great many people. How can you
be certain it's somebody I don't know?
You want a drink?
He's a man I know.
It's of no importance.
I'm sure it's of no importance to you
whom you sleep with,
but it's of considerable
importance to me.
Why worry? There's plenty left.
Get out of here, you bastard. Get out!
I'm calling the police. Get out!
I wanna know who it was.
Listen to me, goddamn it. I pay the rent.
Get out of here.
All right. Wait a minute.
I'm sorry I slapped you, all right?
Get out of here.
No! Dammit...
- Listen, you tell me who...
- No.
- Tell me who it is!
- He's not a pig like you!
Susan!
David. What's the matter?
I think I killed Susan.
- What happened?
- I killed her.
I just needed to talk
before I go to the police.
Sit down. Sit down.
It was an accident. I didn't mean to...
She was with some man
and I just must have gone crazy.
The man was there? He saw you?
He saw me go in, yeah.
Who is he?
It was dark.
Then maybe he didn't see you.
I parked my car. I stood under the light.
He saw me.
I can't come to the phone,
but when you hear the beep,
tell me everything.
Did she ever photograph you?
No.
This is a negative side of a Polaroid.
I found it under the bed.
- Are you absolutely certain?
- I'm certain. I'm not that big a fool.
Then we have to find
the man who saw you.
What if... the search for this man
was of vital national security?
A secret operation that we could control.
- It won't hold up to scrutiny.
- We'll invent an eXcuse for the search.
The important thing is to abort
an investigation of Susan's death
- before it ever gets to you.
- No.
- It's a house of cards. There is no Yuri.
- It doesn't matter.
All the intelligence agencies believe that
there's a mole in the defense department.
You know the theory.
That Yuri was sent here by the KGB
while he was still in his teens,
and for all intents and purposes
he can pass as an American.
They've been talking about that
for four years. It's the CIA's wet dream.
- There's never been a shred of evidence.
- But now there is.
He was the man
who spent the weekend with Susan.
He was the man who killed her.
Lorraine, would you ask CID
to get all the material on Yuri
and then bring it into the secretary
as soon as possible? Thank you.
I don't think we can bring this off.
You can.
Good morning, Major.
- Morning.
- Thank you.
If military intelligence can catch this
KGB agent without outside assistance,
it will immeasurably
strengthen us against the CIA.
This has to move like lightning, before
anyone gets on to what we're doing.
Assume control of the investigation.
Responsibility is consonant
with your office.
I have implicit trust in you
to keep this under wraps.
You're to report to me
or to Secretary Brice only.
- I plan to remain here around the clock.
- What do the police know?
They haven't been informed.
CID has taken the body to Fort Meade.
If we go looking for a Russian spy without
the FBI or the CIA, it's gonna raise hell.
That's my problem.
Well, what do we have
on the dead woman?
It's through Yuri's association with
this woman that we'll be able to find him.
Here's everything we know about her
for the moment.
It looks like
he spent the weekend with her.
He brought her home
and killed her around midnight.
I'm counting on it not being too hard
to find out where they'd been.
Yeah... Yes.
- I'm certain the investigation will...
- Will you eXcuse me?
- Commander Farrell, are we boring you?
- No, sir. May l...?
- We can't even convince our own people.
- It's all right.
Get Donovan in here.
Commander, if you please.
Major Donovan
of the criminal investigation division.
His men will conduct the investigation
subject to your orders.
We're set up
down in the situation room, Commander.
We have to have a front man.
- They're autopsying the body.
- I wanna see her apartment.
- I don't think that'll be necessary.
- Maybe not, but I want to.
- They're autopsying the body now.
- Good.
- Scott, I wanna see her apartment.
- Mr Pritchard...
CID will do a better job.
It's important that you remain here.
I've got men checking for physical
evidence. The print people are just back.
- What did they find?
- All fragments or smudged. It was clean.
- What's going on?
- A matter of the utmost importance.
- What is this?
- We're checking calls made this week
- to see if her number comes up.
- There's gotta be millions.
We interface with the phone company,
monitoring every call in a 50-mile radius.
We're checking gas station
and hotel credit card receipts.
- Who is this bimbo anyway?
- She's dead.
One billfold... A bracelet.
- This is the evidence from her house?
- Yes, sir.
One boX of candy mints.
Got one brown hairbrush.
Commander Farrell is on his way in. We'll
have a report on the house-to-house soon.
- What's this?
- Polaroid negatives.
- I can't make anything out.
- If there's silver left on the emulsion,
we may be able
to bring out the picture. EXcuse me.
Sergeant,
get this right over to the photo lab.
Sir... Commander. Mr O'Brien
is waiting for you in your office.
We made an appointment
to go over the CIA report.
- Just cancel it.
- If we do, he'll go away suspicious.
That's true.
I'll be in Commander Farrell's office.
Could you call me in five minutes?
Sorry it took so long.
- This is the official estimate.
- An advance copy. Isn't it what you want?
Pritchard here.
Yes, of course.
Sorry. I'm wanted in the secretary's office.
I suggest that we reschedule this meeting.
- Commander Farrell and I can continue.
- The Commander...
- That would be satisfactory.
- We're both requested at the meeting.
I'm afraid we really must stop.
Kevin, I was wondering if you might
help me in the counterespionage...
Tom, we'd better get to that meeting.
Commander, when you get more time,
you give me a call.
I can be reached 24 hours a day.
Good.
What was that supposed to be?
Thought I might get something on Yuri.
What we have will be quite sufficient.
- I want all outgoing calls monitored.
- All calls?
- Brice's lines are safe.
- I'll see to it.
Now.
- What's that?
- Autopsy. She died of a broken neck.
Here's a list of her stomach contents.
What the hell for?
There are chemical pollutants in food.
We might pin down
where she ate her last day.
Stay close to the centre of things, but
do nothing until you're instructed by me.
- Who are they?
- They're associated with Special Forces.
I don't understand. What's that mean?
EXactly what I said. They were formerly in
Special Forces. Now they are associated.
- Honduras? EI Salvador?
- Somewhere down there.
You were with the death squads?
Were they with the death squads?
- It's possible.
- They're assassins.
You needn't concern yourself.
They work for me now. Leave us, please.
You haven't told me everything.
The Atwell woman knew Brice.
She was his mistress.
Naturally, Brice had no idea of her
connection with a Soviet agent.
We only found out last night
after the murder.
Brice is in an impossible situation.
We should call in the FBl.
Don't be an idiot.
Do you realise
the magnitude of the scandal?
The secretary of defense
and a Soviet agent
sharing the favours of a murdered whore?
- David might even be a suspect.
- I think that's something to consider.
Well, it isn't speculation, Tom. Brice
was with me at the time of the murder.
- He couldn't have done it.
- Fine. Then call in the FBI
- and let Brice take his chances.
- That decision is not yours.
What we will do is catch this Yuri
before anyone knows what's happened.
- Then we'll handle the rest.
- You mean the men in the neXt room.
The man is a spy and a murderer. Would
anyone deny that justice had been done?
- Yeah, I would.
- We shall have that discussion later,
but for now I eXpect you to follow orders
and demonstrate the loyalty to which
both the secretary and I have every right.
- You eXpect a lot.
- I depend on you. We're friends.
And, Tom, if it were your intention to do
anything to bring down David Brice,
then I'd have no choice but to make sure
that you didn't get away with it.
- Thank you for the warning.
- I'm certain it's unnecessary.
When you calm down, you'll see
we're following the only possible course.
I gave them the estimates.
They couldn't have cared less.
Get me Senator Duvall.
What's all this top-secret business
I've been hearing about?
Here's what we do have.
CID is running a phone check.
They're looking for all calls
placed to a Susan Atwell.
- Who's she?
- She's in the morgue at Fort Meade.
- She was murdered last night.
- Do we know anything about it?
Get ready for this.
We think she's either David Brice's
or Scott Pritchard's mistress.
She was seen with both of them.
It didn't seem high priority,
so my people have been
a little laX in following it up.
Well, spilt milk... And you can forget
about Pritchard. He's homoseXual.
I'll be damned.
So will he, if you believe
the Old Testament. Who killed her?
We don't know. They got CID believing
that they're searching for Yuri.
Don't tell me anybody swallowed that.
That poor son of a bitch Brice.
You know, I almost feel sorry for him.
- Who's running things at the Pentagon?
- The new boy. Farrell.
So he can take the fall
in case anything goes wrong.
He looked like a man
who'd like a heart-to-heart.
Senator Duvall.
Yeah, listen, Billy. I've been hearing some
disturbing news about the Phantom sub.
I tried to talk to the President about NATO.
All he wanted to talk about
was the Phantom sub.
Why the crunch on that
has to come now is beyond me.
- We'll just have to handle it.
- You've got me handling a hell of a lot.
Yeah. Hold.
Commander. Line two, the other phone.
I'll call you back.
I'll be right down.
- They want me in the computer centre.
- I'll go with you.
Oh, yeah. By all means, go with him.
- What is it, Sam?
- There's no more image
they can get out of this Polaroid.
Damn. Too much to hope for.
We'll just have to forget it.
Maybe not.
There's something I wanna show you.
Now, this is as bad
as your Polaroid, right?
Now watch. This is a training tape.
I'm speeding it up.
The picture is broken down into piXels,
the smallest element on the emulsion,
sort of an atom of the picture.
Then, and this is the good part,
the computer just asks itself
what would be where
if we adjust the piXels.
- That's all there is to it?
- We have to keep on top of the computer.
Computers don't think.
If we had programmed this
to come out a car instead of a monkey,
you'd be looking at a hairy Buick.
- All right. Just get started on it.
- It takes billions of calculations.
The whole process may take 12 hours
or it may take a week.
Well, that's too long.
Perhaps you can get what you need
from the work in progress.
- We'll watch it on this screen.
- We've got our first number.
It's listed to a Nina Beka. She called
last night about the time of the murder.
- I'd better see her.
- I was just about to send my men.
Are you Miss Nina Beka?
- Yes.
- I'm Commander Farrell.
This is Mr Pritchard, general counsel
to the secretary of defense.
May we come in?
Please, do come in.
I'm afraid that we have
some bad news for you.
A woman named Susan Atwell is dead.
She was a friend of yours?
Yes, she is.
In what way were you acquainted?
You see, I work at Shalini's boutique
in the Pavilion.
She used to come in there sometimes.
We'd like you to tell us
as much about her as possible.
We think she was killed
by a man she'd been seeing.
- Why?
- You needn't concern yourself with why.
We just need the names
of the men she... consorted with.
- "Consorted with"?
- Yes.
- I don't know about Susan's personal life.
- I'll ask you again.
Who were the men she saw?
You can ask me a thousand times and the
answer will be the same. I don't know it.
You're South African.
- That's right.
- I don't see a US visa.
You're an illegal alien.
Do you know who I am?
I can pick up that phone and I can have
you on the first plane to Johannesburg.
I'm assuming that you have a reason
for not wanting to be there.
You guessed right.
I know who you are.
I know who Brice is.
David Brice.
Is that the name you're looking for?
We're not interested in him.
There's another man we want.
Well, in that case,
why don't we make a deal?
We'll talk about it.
Who was the other man?
Who was the other man?!
It was someone at the Pentagon.
- Does he have a name?
- I suppose so, but I don't know it.
Listen...
All I know is that Susan used to see him
and he reappeared.
- How recently? Three months?
- I don't know!
A month, three weeks.
Who cares? I don't know it.
She never discussed
these things with me.
That'll do for now. We'll close the part
of the investigation that concerns you.
Thank you, Miss Beka.
You've been very helpful.
Sam. I want the names
of all civilian and military personnel
assigned to the Pentagon during
the past two months. Can you do it?
It's all in the computer.
I'll set up a program to find it.
Mr Pritchard.
Tom, I've got a suggestion.
We're doing this credit card search,
but nothing charged over the weekend
would be turned in so soon.
- We're wasting valuable computer time.
- I know. I want you to keep on with it.
- What's this all about?
- We'll talk later.
- What is this?
- I have to see Secretary Brice.
Just get started
on that list of new employees.
Yeah. We isolated three pollutants
in the dead girl's stomach contents.
They're the red, green
and blue lines on the graph.
If we can get the overlays to match,
we might pinpoint where she was.
So far, it looks like
somewhere near Upper Chesapeake Bay.
Come in.
EXcuse me, sir.
Have you seen Major Donovan?
- No.
- It's important that I get this to him.
- What do you have here?
- Well, we missed it the first time round.
It must have fallen
under the seat of her car.
I'll take care of this.
Very well, sir.
- Was this a present?
- Yeah.
- He gave it to me.
- He has expensive taste.
Didn't cost anything.
Some foreign minister gave it to him.
I pride myself on being
a man of forbearance and conciliation.
But if you fuck me on this, I'll crucify you!
I am not your rubber stamp.
You have run roughshod over this office
for 20 years. That's over.
Sir, you may disparage
your predecessors all you like,
but I don't recall in the past
any secret investigation
that required the entire department of
defense, circumvented CIA and the FBI
- and the Washington police!
- We're not locked into any position
- on the Phantom sub.
- What are you saying?
I'm just trying to allay Senator Duvall's
fears that we might act peremptorily.
We will act the way I decide
on this matter.
Gentlemen, I don't see any point
in squabbling like children.
Mr Pritchard,
I am encouraged by your attitude.
I'm sure your investigation,
whatever it is, is perfectly proper.
I must apologise
for my unseemly outburst.
- It's just that I've been sorely troubled.
- It's perfectly understandable, Senator.
I'm certain that we can reach
an accommodation.
Gentlemen, I'm deeply gratified.
Deeply gratified, and I hope you'll forgive
my imposition on such a busy day.
- He's got us.
- This is insane. It's out of control.
- Your cover story's not gonna hold water.
- Yes, it will,
but you have to have
more moral courage.
Have you ever heard of a woman
named Nina Beka?
No.
Well, she's heard of you.
Instruct the CIA
to contact you at your home.
Remain there
and wait for the information.
You're not to call me.
I'll check in with you periodically.
- As quickly as possible.
- OK.
Hey. You two!
- Where are they going?
- What's the matter?
- Laurel and Hardy.
- Who's that, Tom?
- You know who I mean. The bookends.
- I sent them on an errand.
- I need a car.
- I'm sorry. CID's got everything.
- This one. Bring this one down.
- You can't take that. The lift just busted.
- Watch your toes.
- Come on. Get out of there right now!
Shit.
- Shit.
- Hi.
Goddamn it, get him! Come on, hurry up.
What you doin'? You crazy?
You OK?
Look out.
I'm gonna get you, motherfucker.
Nina, come with me.
We can't talk. Is there a back way out?
- What happened to Susan?
- We cannot talk here. You're in danger.
- What's going on?
- It doesn't...
- Can I go to my place?
- No. They'll kill you.
You have to get lost, and I mean
really lost. Thank you for before.
- Go.
- There he is.
Look out. He's got a gun.
I think we should go back
to the Pentagon, sir.
That was a stupid, stupid thing you did.
- I think you're crazy.
- I'm going to save Brice, no matter what.
- I told you that.
- I don't believe there is a Yuri.
- He's real enough.
- He has nothing to do with the murder.
- We'll find out when we catch him.
- Not if those two get to him first.
Dammit! I am tired of weakness.
I am faced with a grave problem and
I intend to resolve it quickly and cleanly.
- You are crazy. Fucking cuckoo.
- I won't be insulted by you.
And you're not to interfere
with this investigation again.
Do I make myself clear?
- I quit.
- Your resignation is not accepted.
Tom, be reasonable.
I'm shielding you from full knowledge.
Just follow your orders and
everything'll be all right. Let him go.
Will you eXcuse me, please?
Hope you're not calling your girlfriend.
Remember, Big Brother's listening.
I don't give a shit.
- Hello.
- FoX.
Hello, sir. The writing on the box is
Arabic, but it's in the... Maghrebi dialect.
What they speak in Morocco.
What it says is kinda flowery,
but it boils down to:
"A gift to a true friend."
Good boy. You can come back now.
Tea.
The Polaroid just came on line.
Not much to look at, is it?
No, it's not.
Don't gifts from governments have to be
registered with the office of protocol?
- So they tell us.
- Are their files computerised?
Yes. They would be
in the department of state's computer.
Can we access those files?
They're closed. You'll have to
get in touch with them tomorrow.
I can't get in touch with them.
- We can interface.
- Can you do it now?
There'll be hell to pay.
Tom...
Does it matter to you that much?
OK.
Thanks. I'll be back in five minutes.
Come in.
What is it now?
I've been thinking it over
and maybe you're right.
Yes?
Let's just get this whole business
over with. And I'm sorry I blew up at you.
We're all very tired.
When this is out of the way,
we can do great things here.
Well... first things first, huh?
How are we doin'?
I'm into the state department computer.
It was easy.
- Can you print that out for me?
- You got it.
A lot of paper. Oh, and you were right
about the credit card receipts.
We found one from a gas station
in Annapolis.
Great.
- These the new people at the Pentagon?
- Yeah. There are 4700 possibles so far.
But we've had a real break. The CID
has pinned down your man's blood type.
- How'd they get that?
- Autopsy specimen.
There was a residue of semen
in the body. Blood type is A positive.
That's pretty common,
but it'll narrow the list.
You're a genius, Sam.
I am, I am.
You should get some sleep.
You must be eXhausted.
I know if I'm eXhausted or not.
As you say.
You look like
you just stepped out of a bandboX.
- You're actually enjoying this.
- I'm just trying to do my job.
It would be a lot easier
if you'd stop attacking me.
I'm sorry. I'm just tired.
I've got a lot on my mind.
If it doesn't keep moving towards
a coherent image, we adjust the program.
You mean you could stop it
and make it go in another direction?
We've been doing that all along.
It looks like it's doing fine now.
I'm not so sure.
I think it's time we had a talk.
I'm the one in the picture, Sam.
You?
Susan Atwell
was the woman I've been seeing.
I had nothing to do with her death.
I was in love with her.
Jesus. You must feel terrible.
You're the only one I can tell
that this spy-hunt is phoney.
- Yuri has nothing to do with the murder?
- Nothing.
This is a cover-up. That's all I can tell you.
- Come on!
- Goddamn it, Sam.
This is for your own protection, all right?
These people have already
tried to kill one person who knew.
- What do you want me to do?
- Slow up the resolution on that picture.
I need more time, Sam. I need more time
to get this straightened out.
That's what I need.
I'm not satisfied with the way this
is coming up. The eigenvalue is off.
Looks all right to me.
We're pulling away from our reference
information. Program a Fourier transform.
- That seems like a waste of time.
- Just do what I want, OK?
Take it easy. We're all working
the same amount of time.
I'm sorry, David. Just do it, please.
What are you looking for?
Fuck off.
Where are you going?
I'd rather do this myself.
You can listen if you want to.
Just wear that badge.
- This goes here?
- Yeah.
- Where are we goin'?
- Major Donovan's office.
You can give a description
of this guy to him.
- Who the hell's Donovan?
- Our commanding officer.
Hello. You know who this is?
I have to talk to you,
but I can't leave here now.
I'm on the damn payphone now!
It's probably not even safe.
All right. I'll come there
as soon as I can get away.
I'll be damned. That's him!
The one who rented the boat.
- Where?
- He just went around that corner!
Can you see him?
He's gone.
I'll get back to you.
Where have you been? Yuri's here.
- Buzz the secretary.
- They had a witness and...
- I know. Can I go in?
- Go right in.
Well, what are my orders... sir?
Close all the eXits. Hold your witness
while we decide what to do.
Yes, sir.
- Is Yuri here?
- So it would seem.
- This is splendid work, Tom.
- I've had all the eXits closed.
Well, why don't we empty the building
and have everybody file past this man?
The place would be swarming
with TV cameramen.
We'll take the witness round
room by room.
- It's the largest building in the world.
- But the only way we'll get any privacy.
I'll see to it.
- Major Donovan.
- Sir.
I suggest that all officers carry side arms.
The man we're after
has killed one person already.
Don't worry, Tom.
I don't eXpect you to carry one.
Tall or short? Thin or fat? Light or dark?
- That's right.
- You think this is some kind of joke?
What I'm trying to tell you,
the son of a bitch is average.
All right. Let's go find
this average son of a bitch.
Oh, yeah. I'm positive I remember this
guy. I always remember the good tippers.
CID has brought in another witness.
A bellboy from a hotel in Annapolis.
Now you can have two search parties.
That's great news.
We can move twice as fast.
I'll see to it.
You see, David? It's all coming together.
Dear God, I hope you're right.
All right. Down this corridor.
Make it quick.
Let's go.
It ain't him. I just rented the guy a boat.
Gimme a break. I'm sick of this shit.
- How much longer?
- We can't search all the building.
- It would take all night.
- We have shifts finishing at five and siX.
- What do we do then?
- Let them out through the mall entrance.
- We'll have both witnesses there.
- What do you think?
Television.
We haven't been allowed in, but we're told
there's a bottleneck ofhundreds,
perhaps thousands of people,
waiting to go home.
Those who have been allowed to leave
were cleared by members of the CID,
the criminal investigation
division of army intelligence.
Apparently, there's a search on
for a person who may be a spy,
trapped right now
inside the Pentagon itself.
We're going to follow events, and we'll get
back to you as the story continues.
Melissa Donaldson, WCDM,
at the Pentagon.
- He must have gotten out past us.
- No way. He's somewhere in the building.
We'll have to go back
to the room-to-room.
We'll go down to the basement, search
the situation room, computer compleX.
We'll start at the bottom
and work our way up. Let's do it.
- You're to initial this.
- What?
- You're to initial this.
- What is it?
Authorisation to release
the Atwell woman's body for burial.
- We're down to 50 with A positive blood.
- How many are men?
Come on. Nobody told me I had to sort
'em out by seX. I gotta take a break, man.
Sam, I need to talk to you.
- I need your help.
- I slowed it up as much as I could.
- But they'll recognise it soon.
- What more I can do?
- They mean to kill me.
- You haven't slept for two days.
I'm telling you,
I don't stand a chance in hell.
For God's sakes, why? lf you had nothing
to do with the murder, why...?
- Brice killed her.
- Brice?
- She was his mistress.
- I thought she was your...
This...
Antique gold boX...
A present to Brice from the Moroccan
government. He gave it to Susan.
It's the only way I can prove he knew her.
He'll call off the search. I know he will.
- I see.
- Do you believe me?
Well, then, can you insert that
into the state department's computer?
- I could do that.
- I know you can, Sam, but...
will you?
- I'll do whatever I have to do to help you.
- Then let's do it.
There's nothing there.
- If you want a piece of paper, type it.
- Can't we just print?
The computer is searching for
where to insert it and then it'll print out!
- All right. How long?
- Soon.
First two on the right, second two
on the left, last man in the doorway.
- Nobody in or out.
- What's going on here?
- We're gonna search in here.
- Who told you to come here?
Nobody. This is the only area
that hasn't been covered.
All right, we'll be conducting a search
in here, and I ask you all, please...
- Sir, wait...
- Oh, Jesus.
I have to change.
- OK. Let's get going.
- Don't let anyone pass.
Sam Hesselman.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you,
but this is over my head.
It's about Commander Farrell.
I'm not sure...
I'm not sure he knows what he's doing.
All right, I'll meet you. Please
don't mention this to anybody else.
The reason I called you
was because I know you're his friend.
You did the right thing.
- This door is locked.
- Anybody have a master key?
- Isn't this Commander Farrell's office?
- We'd better have a look anyway.
There we go. Maybe this one's better.
Nobody here. Let's get on up the hall
and see what else we can come up with.
Hi.
What's this all about, Dr Hesselman?
Promise me that what I tell you
won't go any further.
I feel disloyal enough as it is.
Of course.
You understand that Tom
is under great strain.
Yes.
He knew the girl who was murdered.
They were very close.
And he thinks
that Secretary Brice killed her.
Look, I know him. He's much more
high-strung than he appears.
And this girl...
I guess he was in love with her.
Now he thinks that
somebody wants to kill him.
He asked me to reprogram
the computers and I did it.
But now...
I don't know. I just don't know.
I see. Where is Commander Farrell now?
I suppose he's in his office
or in the computer room.
Thank you.
Son of a bitch.
Hold it right there! Hold it!
I am your superior officer. I'm giving you
an order to arrest this man!
- I have my orders from Mr Pritchard.
- Do it!
- I have my orders...
- Shut up.
- If he resists, shoot him!
- Where are you going?
You can't go in there.
I said you can't go in there!
- What right do you have to come in?
- Call off the search.
You're not hunting a spy, but somebody
who knows Susan was your mistress.
What?
You gave her a gold boX
that a foreign minister gave you.
- Nonsense.
- You declared it to the office of protocol.
- I never declared anything.
- You tell it to the state's computer.
What?
You tell it to the state department. Pick up
the phone and call off the search now!
Do it, or I swear to God
I'll nail you to the wall.
Calm down. I'll get Scott in... Come in!
I'm sorry.
I had to make sure you were all right.
Yuri must be close.
There's been a murder.
He shot Dr Hesselman.
- Goddamn it.
- What's happened, Major?
I think Yuri's cornered. He's somewhere
between here and the gymnasium.
Very good, Major.
Just continue the search.
You had those apes kill him, didn't you?
No.
You lying sack of shit.
Tom is the man who saw you at Susan's.
He's known about you all along.
Isn't that right?
You know what that means, David.
If Commander Farrell
was with Miss Atwell,
then Commander Farrell
is the man who killed Miss Atwell.
And we know that the man who killed
Miss Atwell is Yuri,
therefore Commander Farrell is Yuri.
Quod erat demonstrandum.
You murdered Sam, didn't you?
You're a fucking asshole.
You have no idea
what men of power can do.
Wait a second.
Scott has been a loyal
and valuable friend.
I let that friendship cloud my judgement.
My actions have been ineXcusable.
Scott.
Give me the gun.
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do,
but I swear I'll do everything I can
to help you out. Everything.
I'll get you the best lawyers.
David, he doesn't have a shred of proof.
Wait.
He was fiercely jealous of Susan.
A man like that... Do you understand?
Suppose we had planned on
working late Sunday night.
I didn't arrive.
He assumed I was with Susan.
Don't touch me. He went there
looking for me. They argued...
- You can assume the rest.
- Save your breath.
Help me out on this. Help me out.
Listen, I'll give you anything you want.
I swear, I'll give you anything you want.
Listen to me. Help me out.
I will give you anything you want.
You can have anything you want.
If you go against me on this, it'll be
your word against mine, and I'll win.
David.
What's going on in there?
Stand back.
Oh, my God. How horrible!
Felson.
Your search is over, Major.
- Is this...?
- He shot himself.
Anderson.
Commander, do I have your answer?
Commander, sir. Are you all right, sir?
Give me your pen, Ensign.
You got a pen? Well, give it to me!
I want you to deliver this. And I want you
to wake him up if you have to.
Aye aye, sir.
Go.
Charlie, come look at this.
Somebody get Donovan down here.
It's Commander Farrell.
A lot of people are looking for you.
Then aren't you the clever ones?
- When's he comin' out?
- When you've made certain things clear.
- Then let's just get to the point.
- Why did we only just hear about this?
You would've known before!
I told you that I could not
get out of the Pentagon!
All right. But your relationship
with the woman was poorly handled!
You wanted me to be her lover.
I was her lover.
- I don't see any point in going on.
- Yeah, well, neither do l!
Yevgeny AleXeyevich...
Wouldn't you love to hear Russian again?
lmagine Pushkin, Lermontov, Tolstoy.
Solzhenitsyn, Aksenov.
Even them. Always the sense of humour.
In the Philippines when you passed a bag
of underwear Moscow wasn't amused.
I should have acted then.
In any case, it's not possible
for you to remain United States.
This bizarre incident
has given them their Yuri.
Yevgeny, think.
- Think! You're a hero of the Soviet Union.
- I'm not a hero.
- Be that as it may, you must return.
- I came here. I thought I owed you that.
But you can't make me go back.
No.
Let him go.
He will return.
Where else does he have to go?
