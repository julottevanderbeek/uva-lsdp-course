Those are the four Jatubaht warriors
that protect the King's elephant.
why do they have to protect it?
the elephant is so big! Who can hurt it?
because the King is riding on the elephant
that is why we have to be careful at the bottom.
careful of what Dad?
you see,
if we lose our sword we need to use Muay:
throw, sit, cut, grab, break
careful of what Dad?
i can't tell you now
but im going to be Jatubaht
so i must know!
not now Kham,
but one day you'll know.

Dad! Por Yai  is bullying me again!

Por Yai don't bully him!

Dad! Dad! Where is Por Yai going?
let him be Kham
pull it tight
pull it tight

like that
if, one day, Dad has the chance to offer Por Yai to the King
it would be the greatest thing ever to happen to me
at least it wont be a waste, to be born into a Jatubaht warrior family
Khon! Look at this! Is it pretty?
this year Songkran  should be fun
Mr Sutem is hosting everything

its actually good, returning
favors to the villagers
Koi! Hey there is going
to be an elephant examination

tommorow after the examination we may never see him again.
it is your chance, dont worry about us.

you're welcome
your face looks like you've been holding in a shit all day!
shit, Tui! You stupid twat!
what the hell are you doing?
sergeant, how'd you know it was me?
you have such a long face
who wouldn't recognise you
drop the gun!
don't come any closer
or i'll shoot you sergeant!
hey... I don't care if you shoot me
but... your Mum
if your Mum comes, you're going to be dead
she comes, you're dead
don't try to trick me
my Mum's not here!
not here? Really! Look behind you
go, go, go! damn you!
go, go, go!
shit, when was it cut?
fuck it, why didn't you tell me...
from the front door to the room
we have people on guard every ten metres
Uncle, I have already prepared everything
I hired the best cook in this town,
especially to make Pao Hue soup
for our other important guests to eat also
I hope that everyone will enjoy it, especially you Uncle
eat up, so you will have good health
when you are in good health
you will continue to manage the business
of our family for a long time to come
you sure this is Pao Hue?
not salty, doesn't smell good,
not sweet, tastes like a worm!
you all know worms?
crawling creature that has
both sexes in a single body
you who could do anything?! what has happened to you, Rose?
you can't even take care of the taste of the food
how are you going to protect me?
my personal safety is now the concern of Cheun
ever since her Father died,
Cheun has taken care of this anyway
her actions are considered as not respectful to others
all the people that we will be talking to
are representatives from the government
if we are on the same side with them
our business has a massive potential for growth
and for you, you can take care of a small restaurant
for you, even this should be enough, Rose
that stupid old man! He embarasses me in front of everyone!
he's not crazy
and there is no need to rush
when you already have this thing, haven't you
i think my fate is greater than that old man's fate
what you doing round here?
what? You're Thai?
well , I'm speaking Thai!
where do you think I'm from?!
are you an illegal immigrant in Sydney?
no, I'm looking for Por Yai and my brother
looking for your relatives?
yes!
what do they look like?
chang
chang? hmm... that name sounds familiar
let's just go talk down at the station
sawadee ka
how's it going Goong?
getting alot of customers?
not at all!
it's because you never come and support my restaurant
I'm very busy at work
hey, look we have a new promotion for lunch
i'll make sure I come when I'm free
the name of the restaurant is Thai
Tom yum goong soup is even thai food
I wonder why they let a Vietnamese like Johnny be the manager?
Johnny! Johnny!
see you later
ok, back to work
me too
hey, don't cause problems
follow him! Hurry!
quiet, quiet
they're the ones who kidnapped Por Yai and Korn
you don't have any evidence
you can't accuse someone just like that
I have a picture but it's in the taxi
don't be so sure, we'll talk at the station
Johnny! Where the hell are my elephants?
give me back my elephants!
Johnny! Give me back my elephants!
hey, I want to warn you since were both Thai
dont mess with them, they're big trouble
damn! Your face gets scarier every day
the King is riding the elephant
that is why we have to be careful at the bottom
enemies will attack there
the four Jatubaht warriors will protect the elephants legs.
what's the crucial technique dad?
one day... you'll know Kham.
Tui?
what the fuck are you doing?
sergeant... they forced me... I...
