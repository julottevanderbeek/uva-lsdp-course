You're makin' me nervous.
First thing.
Right off the bat.
l'd like to apologize.
All right ?
l'm gonna apologize.
l've had to go to the bathroom
for hours. l've been backed up.
Totally backed up.
Anyway, l swear to God,
l didn't mean to scare you.
l'm sorry if l pulled your hair,
all right ?
You okay, huh ?
Good.
All right. Now don't talk,
all right ? Please.
l need to ask you
a favor.
l haven't seen my parents
in a long time, right ?
'Cause l just got out
of jail.
l was innocent.
Okay. Before l went away,
l made up a few lies.
l said l was married. l also told them
l worked for the government...
and that l would be away
for a long time.
Now, what l need you to do,
is l need you to come...
to my parent's house
with me, all right ?
And pretend
to be my wife.
Acting, all right ?
Today's your big debut. Your big break.
This is acting, all right ?
You're my wife.
So, that means you adore me,
you love me, you cherish me.
Jesus Christ,
you can't live without me.
Now, the story will go
like this.
We met in high school,
and, uh,
we were sweethearts,
whatever.
You loved me. You've been
in love with me your whole life.
Your new name would be
Wendy Balsam.
All right ?
Don't worry about the details.
l'll take over.
Just be nice.
When you get there,
be a decent girl. Be nice.
Um, what's your name ?
What's your real name ?
- Layla.
- Layla. No. That's no good.
We'll stick with Wendy Balsam,
okay ? You're Wendy Balsam.
So, basically,
what l'm asking you to do,
is l'm asking you
to come there...
and make me look good,
all right ?
lf you make
a fool outta me,
l swear to God,
l'll kill you right there.
Boom. Right in front
of Mommy and Daddy.
l'll tell you something else.
lf you make me look bad,
l will never, ever,
talk to you again.
Ever.
But if you do a good job,
well, then you could be my best friend.
My best friend
that l've ever had.
Hear me ?
All right.
Let's keep driving.
All right ? We're gonna go.
Keep driving.
What's your name ?
My name is Billy.
Billy Brown.
Just remember
why you're there.
You're there to make me look good.
You hear me ?
You can eat all the food you want,
but just make me look good.
- Okay ? Why are you there ?
- To make you look good.
That's right.
To make me look good.

Honey, you don't want

When l eat chocolate,
my face blows up.
Honey, what happened

You better put some ice on that.
When l ate chocolate as a kid,
you had to take me to the emergency

Honey, l don't know what

You always ate chocolate.

His new, little,
sweet, young daughter.
Sit down, honey.

Oh, honey.
You look like a baby.

My son used to be

He was so beautiful.
Look at him now.
Oh, no.

Um, he ran away.

Didn't l tell you if it peed
in the house again, what l'd do ?
- No, Daddy, please, no !

That's enough with the pictures.

Jan, would you
hurry it up, please ?
Oh, who's this handsome guy
in this picture ?
Oh.
That's me. l was a singer.
That's me in a downtown nightclub
with this band.
You know,
Sinatra sang in that club.
He sang
in that actual club.
Wow, you're a singer ?
Well, l was a singer.
Yeah.
Did you ever make
any records ?
- l mean, do you have any tapes ?
- No, no, no.
Well, a few tapes, yeah.

All right. As soon as we eat,
l'll play you a tape.
Honey, it's gonna be 20 minutes
before l'm done with dinner.
Why don't you play her
the tapes now ?
- You really want to hear this ?
- Yes.
Okay. Follow me.
Wood's kick is up,
and, of course, it's good.
Now, these are some arrangements
Nelson Riddle made...
for Frank, you know,
without Frank's voice, of course,
so he could listen to them, see what
he liked, what he didn't like.
l like to sing to them.
So, let me find
the hole here.
- l hope l can still get up there.
- !!
Hut, hut.

never fall in love !
! So how are they
to know !
! When we met !
! l felt
my life begin !

So, we have Buffalo take the fall...
after being stuck by a 58-yard
touchdown pass from Hassle to Navarro.
!!
! l felt
my life begin !
! So, open up your heart
and let !
! This fool rush in !!
Well, that's enough
of that shit.
Your voice
is so beautiful.
Yeah, well.
Let's go and eat.
- Can l hear one more ?
- No, l'm hungry.
l'm shaking without dinner.
Let's go.
- Please, just one more song.
- No more ! Okay ?
l'm sorry, honey.
Jesus Christ.
Hey, listen,

You take it home,
play it anytime you want, okay ?
- Okay.
- 'Cause Daddy loves you,
you know that.
l love you.
Let's go.
They have four linebackers,
and the rest are defensive backs.
lt'll make Buffalo think about
keeping the ball in the air.
lt's a challenge.
They're trying to say,
if you're going to go anywhere,
you're gonna have
to throw it in the air.
Billy, you're right.
Your father does have
the most beautiful voice.
Careful, everybody. lt's very hot.
Hope you like tripe.
Oh, actually,
l don't know what that is.
Well, the ltalians
call it trippa.
lt's the intestines of the cow,
and it's very good for you.
lt's terrific. lsn't that what
you said was your favorite food ?
- Go ahead, honey.
- Go ahead.
- Tell me what you think.
- Go ahead, Wendy. Take a big bite.
Go ahead. Take a big,
bigger bite. Mmm.
- That a girl.
- There you go. Bring more, Ma.
She's going to eat a lot.
l sense it.
Well, everybody
gets the same.
Turn that knife away from me, please.
Why are you pointing that knife at me ?
That why you came,
to stab me with
that knife, huh ?
Will you turn it away
from me, please ?
- Honey, calm down.
- Turn it away, please !
What, what ?
The knife is not pointed at you !
- lt's pointed at me !
- Honey !
- Don't tell me you didn't point
the knife at me.
- l did not.
Don't point a knife at a person
unless you wanna use it !
l didn't point the knife at you !
lt was here !
- On the table, like that !
- lt was not here !
- Point it over here. Over here.
- Fine. Fine.
Honey, calm down,
all right ?
- l am calm.
- All right. She's talking, all right ?
- Did you see what your son did ?
- l didn't do nothin'.
- He pointed a knife at his father.
- Yeah, yeah.
- l pointed it at you.
lt's always at you, Dad.
- Honey, honey.
- You want some more tripe, honey ?
- No, l don't want tripe.
You want to get me tripe ?
Get me tripe.
No, listen, let him fill up
on the bread. Enough tripe.
- Let me eat bread.
That's what he wants me to eat.
- That's your son.
Bread all the time,
right ?
God forbid l should
have a piece of meat, right, Dad ?
So, um, Wendy, honey.
You were saying ?
l was just, um,
l was gonna say how Billy's the--
the nicest husband
in the whole world.
Oh, yeah, sure.
l'm sure he's terrific.
No, really.
l'm the luckiest girl...
to have found
such a wonderful husband.
l fell in love with him
the first time l met him.
Long-lasting Energizer
batteries keep going--
Honey, can you pass me
the remote control, there ?
lt's right behind you.
Still going. Long-lasting Energizer--
Did Billy ever tell you
how we met ?
Oh, um, no, honey.
How did you two meet ?
Billy, you didn't
tell your mom how we met ?
You tell her.
Well. l was working
as a typist for the C.l.A.,
which is a special part
of the government.
And Billy is a top agent
with the C.l.A.
l'm sure you know that.
You're probably so proud of him.
Anyway, he has hundreds
of people working for him.
All the girls in the office
were always telling me...
how much they were
in love with their boss.
l had never seen him,
because l worked way down...
on the other side
of the building.
But one day, he comes
into the office, and l see him,
and l fell in love--
madly in love-- with him.
But, you know, l couldn't talk to him,
because l was just a typist, and--
He's the kindest, smartest,
most handsome guy there.
l mean, even the guys loved him.
They idolized him.
So, l just,
l just couldn't.
l didn't think he'd ever like me.
l was just a typist girl.
And, you know,
he was like, the king.
l mean, even the president
is so proud of him.
So, one day...
l walk into my office,
and there's this giant
bouquet of roses.
l was just like, my God,
what are those flowers on my desk ?
l thought maybe they had gotten
the wrong desk or something.
So, l go over
and l open the card.
There was
a little note attached.
And it said:
''Dear Wendy, l have been in love...
''with you for a year,
but l'm very shy.
''l didn't know how
to tell you before this.
''But l want you to know
that l really love you,
and l'd love to take you out
to dinner sometime.''
- And guess who it was signed by ?
- Who ?
- Honey, honey, hold on.
Watch this play, all right ?
- Billy.
lt was signed by Billy.
lt said, ''Love, Billy.''
Uh-huh. Watch this play,
all right ? Just watch this.
Linder will snap.
Wood tries
to kick his longest ever on grass.
No good !
Aah, goddamn it.
Goddamn it !
Thirty years,
l haven't missed a game.
They haven't won
the championship since 1966.
l missed that game,
'cause that's the day l had Billy.
Oh, l wish
l never had him.
l wouldn't have
missed that game.
Wow.
Did you like
Buffalo too ?
Um, it's Billy Brown calling.
l'd like to bet
on the Super Bowl.
On Buffalo.
To win.
Right.
Um.
l'd like to put
- Oh, $10,000 !
- Hold on one second.
That's too much, Billy !
You're gonna get in trouble !
Shut up.
l'm talking on the phone !
Come on, Scott.
Come on, Scott.
Wood tries
to kick his longest ever on grass.

$10,000 bet on Buffalo
to win the Super Bowl.
That's to win, okay ?
Now, l know what
you're thinking.
The story's hard
to believe, right ?
l mean, what kind
of an idiot would bet...
on Buffalo to win
a big game like that ?
lt's true,
l swear to God it happened.
l mean, this guy
was so out of touch...
he didn't even have the ten large
to cover his bet.
Hey, tell somebody
to turn up the heat.
So, Billy.
What happened was this bookie
got so sick...
of hearing everybody's excuses.
l mean, they're all the same,
you know ?
Everybody's got an excuse.
Anyway, this bookie got so sick
that he just had to throw up.
The only way he could make himself feel
better was to-- to do bad things.
To do very,
very bad things to the excuse maker.
And very, very bad things to the
excuse maker's mother and father.
So, what do you say ?
Why don't we give this story
a happy ending ?
l got an acquaintance,
a friend,
a very good friend of ours,
and he just got arrested.
Of course, he's innocent.
His arrest is
a goddamn injustice, a tragedy.
So, you, the asshole,
will confess to the crime
of which he is accused,
so as to free
the innocent man.
Now, if you fail...
to convince the court,
or if you refuse
to try to,
then very evil and very bad things
are gonna happen.
Very evil
and very bad things.
Oh, and, Billy.
lf Buffalo ever makes it back
to the Super Bowl,
bet against them.
Now, get the fuck
out of my sight.
All rise.
Mr. Brown,
based on your confession,
you are found guilty
as charged.
Therefore, it is the judgment
of this court...
that you are sentenced
to the maximum term.
Five years. No parole.

This one is going to go in June.
See how l've
been doing it ?

You know something, Goon ?
You know what you are ?
You know your problem ?
Your problem is your mother.

-l need you for one second.
- Get a phone book.
- Don't be sore at me like that, Billy.
l just need you
to get a phone book !
Every time your mother says
something, that's how you--
That's why people

Do you know why
they call you Goon ?
Because you're retarded.
And you're ugly. You're an ugly retard.
And they call you Goon because
you're ugly and retarded.
And you'll always

Because l used to see you

Because every time l looked out
my window, l would see you walkin' by.
This is Don, and--
What's your name again ?
- Billy Brown.
- Billy Brown. Yeah, yeah, that's it.
Billy, this is Don Shanks,
my fiance.
How you doin', Billy ?

- Sure. Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Well, it was nice meetin' ya... again.
Yeah.
You know, that girl

- We're going.
- Thank you anyway though.
- What do you mean ?
- Sure.
You wanna stay ?
You stay. l'm goin'.
Billy, look at that girl.
Look at her.
She's so creepy.
She's so creepy,
and you are so nice.
- What's that supposed to mean ?
- l just think--
l mean, you're much
too good for her and--
Don't give me no fuckin'
bullshit, all right ?
l don't need your pity,
''she's too good for me'' crap.
So what, we're gonna leave
because you ran into someone...
that you had a crush on
in middle school ?
l'm gonna kill Scott Wood.
l'm just gonna kill him.
- What are you saying ?
- l'm gonna kill that motherfucker.
- l'm just gonna kill him.
- Billy ? What are you saying ?
-
- l'm goin', okay ?
Let me tell you something.
l don't care about you or
your fuckin' hot chocolate.
l don't need anybody.
Did you hear what l said ?
Did you hear
what l said this time ?
Want to know the truth ? l could have
had any girl l wanted in school.
Any girl l wanted. You know why
l didn't have a girlfriend ?
Huh ? Because there was
nobody that l liked.
Nobody that l liked.
That's the truth.
l could have
had anybody.
There was nobody that l liked,
because girls stink.
They stink.
They're evil.
And they're all bad,
all of them.
They're backstabbers
like you.
- So, let's go, all right ?
- l'm not going.
- You want to stay ?
- Yes !
- You stay, all right ? Fuck you.
- Fuck you too !
Yeah, fuck you.
- Could l use the bathroom ?
- Someone stole the key.
Use the one at Denny's.
Please help me.
What's wrong ?
Please, God.
l can't--
Oh, fuck.
l don't wanna live.
No, l don't wanna live.
Don't wanna live.
Hey. Hey. Hey.
l'm sorry.
Can we just go out of here ?
What about
the hot chocolate ?
l really want you
to come with me.
l wanna get away from
that witch over there.
Okay.
- Okay ?
- Okay.
Here.
So you wanna
go get a room now ?
You can take a bath.
You'll feel better.
Okay. We got time.
Need a room for one night.
- How many nights ?
- One night.
Here. Fill this out.
Rooms are 29.99 plus tax.

l'll need a license
and cash or credit card.
What really happened
with you and Wendy Balsam ?
You've been so quiet
all night.
- l don't wanna talk about it.
- Well, l'm not jealous.
l just, you know, wondered.
l told you l don't
wanna talk about it.
Checkout time is at 11:00 a.m.
No smoking in the room.
Don't sit on this bedspread.
lt's disgusting.
Let's take this off.
These are dirty.
l'm cold.
You never even went out
with Wendy Balsam, did you ?
l told you l did.
l knew her since
l was in kindergarten.
She was in my class.
l remember--
Oh, l hated school so much.
l just--
l didn't like
to wake up. l--
First day
l went to school...
l just remember
l was crying and screaming.
And my mother--
She had to drag me there.
And then when
l got into class...
that's when l saw her.
And l remember just...
staring at her.
And l started
thinking things.
l was very young, but l was
imagining kissing her...
and marrying her.
And l just thought
about her every day,
all the time.
And then schooltime
would go by fast.
And sometimes l would
see her in church.
And l hated church too.
And if l saw her in church,
it was good,
because then time
went by really fast.
Did she know
that you liked her ?
No.
She would just--
She would just tell me
to stop staring at her all the time,
mocking me out.
''Take a picture.
Why don't ya ?''
Did you ever have
any other girlfriends ?
No.
Just her.
l'm gonna fill up the whole tub.
My father used to make us fill up the
tub just, like, an inch of hot water.
That's all we were
allowed to use.
He was so cheap.
- Billy, are you in the tub yet ?
- Why ?
Can l come and
sit in there with you ?
l don't wanna be
out here alone. l'm cold.
l'm in the tub, all right ?
l don't want anybody coming in here.
l just want to sit
in the bathroom with you.
l don't wanna be out here.
l'm cold and--
l don't wanna be here.
Well, no, you can't, all right ?
l'm in the tub.
l won't look. Please, just
let me come in and talk to you.
Oh, man.
-
- Hold on.
All right, you can come in,
but don't look at me.
lf you look at me one time,
l'm gonna throw you out of the room.
All right, l promise
l won't look.

uh, in five minutes.
Get ya a hot chocolate.

and the most handsome.
And l love you.
Hey, Goon, it's me.
l just called to tell ya that
l was sorry for yelling at ya before.
Yeah ? Well, you're
always yellin' at me, Billy.
Just wanted to tell ya
that l was sorry...
and to say thank you
for sendin' me raisins.
l sent you raisins, Billy.
l found a little box for them,
and l sent them to you.
And you're not
very nice to me,
and l don't know if l wanna be friends
with you, if you're gonna yell at me.
l understand, Goon. l--
Please, l asked you already.
Don't call me Goon.
l asked you not to call me Goon.
My name is Rocky.
l meant to say Rocky.
l was gonna
call you Rocky, okay ?
l called because l want
to give you the combination...
to my locker
at the bowling alley.
You're gonna give me
a combination ? Why ?
You know my good luck pen
in there ?
l want you to have
my good luck pen.
l left it in there for ya.
You can have
my bowling ball.
You can have all my things,
if you want.
What ? l don't want your things.
l don't want your things.
Those are your things.
Why are you giving away your stuff ?
l want you to--
You're my best friend, and...
l'm really sorry that
l always yell at you and stuff.
'Cause you--
You've been
a good friend to me.
You sent me those raisins.
Billy, are you
gonna do bad things ?
ls that why you're givin' me
all your stuff ?
No. l was kidding
about Scott Wood.
l don't really care
about that anymore.
l got a big job,
and l really have to...
work for a long time.
l'll be away, so--
l'm gonna give you
the combination, okay ?
lt's 32, 17, 21.
- You're my best friend, okay ?

!!
Run ! Run ! Run !
Tackle 'im !
Tackle 'im !
Tackle 'im !
Oh, no ! No !
- Jan ? Jan !
- God ! No !
- Jan, it's 2:00, you know ?
- No-- Huh ?
lt's 2:00. l'm gettin'
the shakes out here, and l'm starving.
- Can we get something to eat, please ?
- Goddamn.
- All right, honey.
- You hungry ?
- Yeah.
- So am l.
Hey, forget it.
Did you hear what l said ?
Forget it.
You cannot have anything in my locker.
l take it all back.
l took everything back.
You heard me now.
l said it. l'm takin' it back,
so stay away from my locker.
lf l find out you go near
my locker, l swear to God,
l'll give you a karate chop
right in the head.
All right ?
Guess what.
Guess what happened today.
l got a girl.
All right ? l got a girl.
There's a girl who loves me,
and she's very pretty,
and she's very nice,
and she loves me.
So what do you think of that ?
So stay away from my locker.
l take all my things back,
all right ?
l saw Wood today.
l'm at the strip joint, yeah.
This place is crazy.
Um, he seems like
a nice guy too.
He really is just like...
a normal guy.
You know, l think--
Remember, we used to like Wood.
He kicked good that season.
He was good
that whole season.
He kicked good all year.
He missed one measly field goal,
and everybody's against him.
l mean, the guy--
Who told me to bet on Buffalo ?
Buffalo stunk all year.
They gave the Giants that game.
Matter of fact, if it wasn't for
Wood, they would have lost three
or four other games that year.
What ?
l'm telling you the truth.
l'm here. No.
Anyway, listen,
l'll give you a call tomorrow.
l gotta go, okay ?
My girlfriend's waitin' for me.
- Oof ! Hey !
-  Yeah ?
- How ya doin' ?
- Okay.
Uh, you have
hot chocolate, right ?
- Sure do.
- ls it hot ?
- lt's hot.
- All right, give me
a hot chocolate to go.
- A large one, large one.
- Okay.
- Hot chocolate to go, large.
- Make it good.
- Make it good, good one.
- lt'll be good.
Hey, let me have one of these, uh--
Let me have a heart cookie too.
That's nice.
- How much are the heart cookies ?
- Heart cookies ?
- They're 95 cents.
- Ninety-five ?
- Right.
- Okay. You got a girlfriend ?
- Yeah.
- Yeah ? All right.
l'm gonna buy one for him.
- Okay.
- lt's for your girlfriend, all right ?
Don't chomp on it yourself.
Save it for her.
- Okay, he's got a heart cookie comin'.
- Who made those ?
- We make 'em right here.
- That's very nice, a heart cookie.
- Who thought of the heart ?
- l don't know.
Somebody who was romantic.
- What do l owe you ?
- Okay, let's see.
- Go easy. Easy, easy, easy.
- Okay, okay.
- Easy !
-
- Four bucks on the nose.
- Four bucks.
- Four bucks, right.
