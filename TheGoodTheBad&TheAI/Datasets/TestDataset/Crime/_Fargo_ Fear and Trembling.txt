Reporter:
president Truman
told reporters today
the proud fighting men
of the United States marines
would be successful in pushing
back north Korean troops
surging south
across the 38th parallel.
In consultation
with top officials
of the state
and defense department,
Truman offered unlimited
military aid to south Korea
without seeking an official
declaration of war
Man:
is now experiencing strange
astronomical phenomena.
Reports have come in
from all over the globe
of inexplicable objects
being sighted in the sky.
Got to check you, Otto.
Man 2:
a scientist like yourself
believes such nonsense?
Dodd.
Like the heads of easter island.
What?
Not a sound.
Cheech says
we're going to the moon.
You and cheech?
No, you moron...
America.
I told him,
"don't be stupid."
We got too many gooks to kill.
That mao zedung thinks
he's gonna run the whole show,
be king of the world.
Is that what you want?
Be king like your dad?
Sit on throne?
The way I see it,
you're on throne.
Hey, kill the king, be the king.
That's the world.
If you're feeling sour about it,
write a letter to Napoleon.
Or maybe you've come
to get your revenge.
Me? Nah.
I just want a seat at the table.
Ain't no table.
There's me.
Everybody else sits
on the floor.
So, what are you waiting for?
Sit, avert your eyes.
Woman:
I love this part.
Stupid to bring your kid.
The boy's got to learn
how men are.
Yeah.
But it's the last lesson
he'll ever...
Dodd.
Dodd.
Dodd!
Thought hanzee goes with you
on jobs?
Half-breed's in luverne,
looking for your uncle.
You're what, 15 now?
Small for your age.
And, what, your dad wants you
to be some kind of...
Professional?
You know, a lawyer probably.
Yeah. Suppose we could use
a lawyer.
That what you want, though?
Punch a clock?
Always thought I could do
what you do.
Ha ha! Bust heads?
How's that work with one arm?
I can shoot a gun.
Yeah, but... What happens
when you need to reload?
I'll show you.
Pull over.
Pull over.
Okay, "wild bill."
How's this work?
Ready?
Mm-hmm.
Look at you.
So? What do you need me
to do?
Get in the car, tough guy.
Aah-hoo-hoo!
Think I got your dial tone
Think I got
Billy Baxter's phone
Son of a bitch.
Think I got a bubble-sac
I think I got
a big Mac attack
Hold the pickles,
hold the lettuce
Special orders,
don't upset us
All we ask is that you let us
serve it your way...
Ho. There he is.
There's too much paranoia
There's too much paranoia
Joe bulo says to say hi.
...my mama's afraid to tell me
the things she's afraid of
Well, what you gonna do,
big boy?
Give us a kiss.
You want a kiss?
I'll give you a kiss.
Ow!
My wrist!
Aah! Aah!
Kiss the man, son.
Hurry, before he gets
that sticker.
He's still standing.
Hit him again.
Hit him again!
Gimme a chocolate glaze and...
And a...
An ole fashion.
An ole... an ole fa...
an ole fashion.
Come on.
Get some zip in ya.
God damn it!
It's on them.
Dr. emilious:
Well, it's a war.
Nixon declared it.
The war on cancer.
As long as it's not a war on me.
No, no,
it's not a war against you.
It's a war against your body.
Well, that doesn't sound, um... our...
our doctor said that...
that's, uh, uh, uh,
Dr. gerber?
Mm-hmm. Right, Dr. gerber
said few weeks of chemo.
He said they caught it early.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, and he thought
a few weeks of chemo and...
well, he thought
she'd be out of the woods.
Your blood work
and your x-rays,
these are not,
as they say, good.
I'm getting worse.
Well, if by worse you mean the
cancer's spreading, then... Yes.
But there is a trial,
clinical trial,
that, uh, might be beneficial.
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
Mm-hmm.
We'll try anything.
It's a new drug.
Let's call it "xanadu."
Is that its name?
No, that... that's just
what they're calling it
for the trial.
This drug, xanadu, it...
it has shown promise.
And I'll be getting that drug...
As part of the trial?
Yes.
That or a placebo.
A placebo? Um...
Uh, yeah, I don't understand.
You see, in order to ascertain
the effectiveness of a drug,
it has to be judged
in a controlled setting
against an equal number
of patients
that are not getting the drug.
And those patients, the ones not
getting the drug, they get...
Well, it's like a smartie.
You know smarties.
Well, hold on.
I'm confused.
You said Betsy would be
part of the trial, so...
am I getting the real drug
or the fake drug?
That I can't say.
Shall I sign you up?
Ed:
Oh, okay, I'm close.
Geez.
It's happening.
That one stuck for sure.
Peggy: Ed.
Yeah?
I got to pee.
Oh. Sure.
Oh.
Pbht!
Pbht!
Might just have ourselves
a fall baby if we're...
I mean, can you imagine,
you, me, and a baby?
And I'll buy the shop and...
And we'll live
like three pigs in a blanket.
Ed: Probably need
more space, though.
What's that, hon?
Bigger house.
Not right away, of course,
but, I mean, if we have two,
let's say a boy and a girl,
then they'll need their own...
you know,
a yard if we get a dog.
Anyway, might have to wait
on that seminar.
What?
Yeah, I thought about it,
and, uh...
We just can't afford it
right now, not with the...
buying the butcher shop.
It's $500.
I mean, unless we find
a cheaper one.
A cheaper course?
Yeah.
Well, what,
so I can be a less-good me?
What? N-no.
I...
I-I-I'm saying...
On... on the list
of priorities...
You know, th-this is our future,
the shop,
and, you know,
all that other stuff...
the knittin' class or...
it's not a knittin' class.
It's gonna help me reach
my full potential.
Of course, and I know that.
But, hon, you're so great now,
I'm not sure if I could handle
it if you got any better.
Well...
Better get dressed, yeah.
Now that we got
all that mess cleaned up,
today's the first day
of the rest of our lives.
Help ya?
Got some cars for sale
around back.
This one's a repair.
'65 corvair... "light-handed,
light-footed, lighthearted."
I'm not sure what that means.
Oh, uh, no.
Can't have ya looking inside.
See, I'm entrusted
with the safety of
the customer's effects, so...
It's part of the,
uh, code, so...
Excuse me. All right?
That's, uh... like I said,
what's for sale's outside.
He known to you?
Oh, ed? Yeah.
Yeah, he's the butcher.
I mean, uh... No.
Uh, no, no.
Never seen him before.
Butcher where?
All right, see, that's...
now you got me thinking you're
up to some shady doings, mister.
And, uh... all right.
Look,
I-i was in 'nam, yeah?
Out there, they called me
"mad dog,"
so you just...
you watch your, uh...
Do you miss it?
What?
Well,
the... the country...
you know, the wet, the heat,
the bugs?
Do you miss that?
God, no.
It's this quiet
I can't get used to,
this...
Frozen winter.
Yeah, well...
Can't argue with ya.
Did you work the tunnels?
The...
"send the Indian," they'd say.
"Who cares about booby traps?
Give hanzee a flashlight
and a knife
and send him down
into the black echo."
Moving through the earth
like a rat,
killing off Charlie,
taking his ears...
Ears?
You got to push their faces down
into the dirt
so they don't scream
and wake the others.
Karl: Whoo!
Where on god's green earth
do you keep the plunger?
Is there a problem here, Sonny?
I don't know.
'Course you don't.
Friend, is there a problem?
He's got a knife, Karl.
Yeah, Sonny, I got eyes.
I said, do we got a problem?
He seemed real angry.
Yeah, I got that part.
Any other Einstein insights
you can share with me?
An Indian...
I think.
Get the phone, kid.
We'd better alert
the local constable.
The...?
The sheriff, you idiot.
Yeah. Okay.
Surprised me there at the end...
your finger.
You like that?
Didn't say I liked it.
Said you surprised me.
You got that bump, then?
I'm worried your family's
gonna go the wrong way
on this thing.
Floyd's smart.
She'll take the money.
And what about your dad?
Him?
You probably got to kill him.
And you're okay with that?
You know what depresses me?
I missed the '60s...
free love, drop acid, Woodstock.
Wake up one day,
decide you want to call yourself
flower rainblossom,
you just call yourself
flower rainblossom.
Yeah, but the '70s
were always coming,
like a...
what do you...
A hangover.
And you know what happened
to flower rainblossom?
She's on methadone in bismark,
turning tricks
for breakfast meat.
I know.
But at least I would've
had fun, be free...
Like how you get to dream
before you wake up.
I saw the Indian
left town yesterday.
Hanzee?
Dad sent him to find rye.
He shot a judge, I heard.
So he's either hiding out now
or dead.
Either way,
could be gone for good.
You're boring me.
I thought
we were gonna have some fun.
We had fun, darling.
How I know is I can still feel
your finger in my ass.
That was my thumb.
So,
the sit-down today,
you think Floyd says yes...
Takes the deal?
What I hear,
she's got a compromise.
Give some, keep some.
Is that Otto's idea?
Grandpa? No.
He's a legume.
They're taking him
to the doctor later,
see if they can stop
the droolin'.
Is that right?
Mm.
Which doctor?
Thought I'd take Molly
ice fishing this weekend.
Mm.
Bring something more
than just jerky this time.
That's what my dad brought.
Yeah, but she's 6,
and she's a girl.
Gonna have to learn this stuff.
Hey, so...
Should I be, uh...
i don't know...
uh, treating you any different?
Please don't.
Well, you let me know.
Mm-hmm.
Better get inside
and take my sugar pills.
Dispatch:
State car 18, come back. Over.
Uh... That's me.
Yeah, I know.
Go.
I'll be fine.
Indian buck...
had like a rat face.
Didn't much like
the look of him.
Scared me...
a little.
Sorry.
Took Betsy to a specialist.
And?
Uh, well, uh, there's a trial...
um, clinical.
New drug, so, uh,
we signed up for that.
Okay.
What'd I miss here?
Uh, well, uh...
This... this Indian fella
put a scare to Sonny.
Luckily, Karl was nearby,
stressin' the plumbing.
Scared the Indian off.
What was he doing exactly,
this, uh, Indian?
Well, I found him
out here in the bay,
looking over Ed's car...
seemed real interested.
Ed renner?
No, ed blumquist...
you know,
works bud's butcher shop.
Yeah. Wife's car, technically.
Got some front-end damage
you can see.
As in...
Front-end damage
like the kind you get
running down a gunman
who just shot up three people
at the waffle hut?
The what now?
Uh, no, no, this was,
uh, from an accident yesterday.
Bluth took the report.
Said the blumquists hit a tree
off ice patch junction,
tree branch went through
the window...
lucky the wife wasn't killed.
Hit it coming and going?
Yeah, yeah, I saw that.
Sonny: Peggy said
garage door bit her in the back.
But I, uh, found bits of wood in the
bumper, so...
Not saying she's lying,
but, you know, uh...
Ed: Hey. Burning it
at both ends, huh?
Uh, yeah.
You gonna get that?
Yeah.
Thank you for sitting with me
here today
and for giving us time
to consider your offer.
I've asked the bank
to arbitrate as neutral party.
Whatever makes you comfortable.
This is your town.
Where's Mr. milligan?
Another matter,
back in Kansas City.
So, we've given you 48 hours
to consider.
Do we have a deal?
No.
But I have a counteroffer,
a respectful one.
Instead of a straight sale,
us to you,
we pay you $1 million cash money
plus 20% of our territory
in Minnesota.
We also discount
transportation fees
on all Kansas City merchandise,
In exchange,
we retain full control
of our remaining operations...
the gerhardt family
still runs north Dakota
but with Kansas City.
Partnership, not a sale...
that's our offer to you.
And we believe
it's more than fair.
I see.
Now...
I don't know.
Maybe, when you look at me,
you see an old woman,
and I am 61.
I've borne six children,
had three miscarriages.
Two of my sons are here today.
Two were stillborn.
My firstborn, elron,
killed in Korea...
gook sniper
took off half his head.
The point is...
Don't assume, just because
I'm an old woman,
that my back is weak
and my stomach's not strong.
I make this counter because a
deal is always better than war.
But no mistake...
we'll fight to keep what's ours
to the last man.
You're a good woman.
I wish I'd known your husband.
No.
My husband would've killed you
where you stood
the first time you met.
So be glad
you're talking to his wife.
And that's what I'm glad for.
And if it were up to me,
I would take your counter...
Partner up...
Except I got to admit,
I-i just wonder,
if we make this deal,
split the territory,
we move in,
can you guarantee
your boys will abide?
My sons listen to their mother.
Good.
Okay.
Except here are two of my men
assaulted just this morning in
the appropriation of doughnuts
by your oldest...
attacked in peacetime,
during a period of deliberation,
without provocation.
Oh, I was provoked.
Hush.
My sons will abide.
Ah, s-s-see,
that... that...
that's the problem
with a family business.
Now, if one of my men defies me,
puts a deal in jeopardy,
I take his arm.
If he talks out of turn,
I take his tongue.
But you... your children,
your grandchildren...
what are you willing to do
to show us you're committed?
I'll deal with my son.
This partnership will hold.
Oh, come on, you're gonna
let this guy come here
and disrespect us, disrespect pop?
Floyd: Quiet!
Bunch of fruits in ties and pocket
protectors. Take him out now!
I'll pick my teeth with you.
Take him out!
I'll pick my freakin' teeth
with you!
Get off me!
I apologize.
He's a proud man.
His father built an empire,
and he just wants what's his.
He'll fall into line.
No.
I don't think he will.
Hold up.
Who's the dumb-ass?
Go around to the passenger seat.
Slide across.
Hurry up.
Yeah, yeah.
Ollie:
Well, what's the holdup?
Think maybe I flooded it.
Take him inside! Go!
Joe bulo says hi.
Your counter has been rejected,
and now we're lowering our price
by $2 million.
But because I respect you
and your family,
I'm gonna give you the night
to think it over.
Anything other than
unconditional surrender,
and we'll wipe
every last gerhardt
off the face of the earth.
Hiya, bud.
Bud: Where the heck
did go yesterday?
Yeah.  I, uh...
I'm real sorry about that.
Peg had a kind of...
Emergency, and, you know? Yeah.
Well... You know that check
you gave me
for the down payment?
Yeah.
Yeah, it bounced.
No, that's not...
I-I checked the account
myself.
Bud, I got the funds.
Well, I don't know about that.
It's just the check you gave me
didn't clear.
So, you know, there's this
other buyer up in sleepy eye,
wants to be closer
to his sick mother.
Yeah, he offered
more than you and...
I'm moving to Florida so...
b-bud, no.
I got the funds.
Yeah, just let me call
over there,
straighten this thing out.
Yeah, so, it's Tuesday.
Figure we'd agree Friday.
If you don't got the money,
I'll go ahead and sell to him,
the other buyer.
Like I said,
he's up in sleepy eye.
Take a look at that grinder,
will you?
It's making a funny noise.
Geez, hon.
Where's your coat?
Hon, did... did you...
We talked about this.
Yeah, we... didn't w...
didn't we talk about this?
What happened?
Something with the car?
Did they find blood?
The car... no, no.
This is about the shop, yeah?
And... and we...
we shook on it, bud and me.
I-I wrote a check
for the down payment,
and... and now I-i-I'm hearing...
Hon.
That... he said
the check bounced...
insufficient funds.
So I call over there, and...
W-we agreed, right?
W-well, we never...
i thought...
You told me, but I never...
Well, now there...
there's another buyer
up in sleepy eye,
and he's gonna get the shop.
Well, he can't do that.
You shook on it.
Yeah, but the check bounced...
insufficient funds.
We talked about this.
Well, if you mean
y-you talked
and then I also talked,
then, yeah, I guess.
But not really sure you heard
anything I said. Yeah, I...
Hon, I'm sorry.
I am.
But, you know, this course,
the one I've been
telling you about, lifespring,
it's real important.
Yeah, more important
than the shop?
Maybe?
I mean, to
Well...
Y-you got to get the money back
right away.
I mean, just call them
and tell them you're sorry,
but... but you need the money
for...
Ed, it's...
'cause on Friday he sells
to the fella up in sleepy eye,
and then we're...
we're s...
Screwed.
Constance:
Everything okay?
I need the money back
for the course.
Sent that on already.
I need it back!
Ed says we could lose the shop.
Oh, ed says?
Well, then, stop the presses.
Come here.
Sit down.
I...
Look in that mirror, hon.
Tell me what you see.
I don't know. A girl?
You get your period?
Then what girl?
That's a woman... a strong,
beautiful, vibrant woman.
And no man should be able
to tell you what to do,
not with your body
or your money.
How much I been paying you here?
$600 a month.
And you've been saving.
Ed and I put away
one-third every week,
minus the occasional...
so $200, and you gave me $500
for the course,
so that's 2h months' savings,
your money,
for you to spend as please.
But I get it.
It's what we do.
We surrender our needs
to the needs of men
to our great detriment.
But no more.
Say it with me.
No more.
No more.
That's right.
You're gonna go to sioux falls,
and you're gonna take
this course,
and you're gonna be the best
Peggy blumquist you can be,
and no one's ever gonna tell ya
how to live your life again.
What the heck?
Ooh.
You need to invite me in.
I could make some coffee.
Uh, none for me, thanks.
I saw your car at the shop.
Yeah, I slipped on some ice
on the way to work.
My fault, really.
I was going on about something.
Ran right off the road
into a... Tree.
Lucky Peggy wasn't killed,
you know.
Hmm.
Something wrong?
No, I-i just...
I'm sorry.
Uh, come in, sit down, please.
I want to be clear
about something.
I can help, but you
got to be straight with me.
Well, what, uh...
If I check the car,
the interior,
I'm not gonna find blood?
Oh.
Well, ed hurt his neck...
That's why I got the...
But no blood.
You didn't fight, did you, ed...
in the war?
No, sir.
I got the one kidney.
So...
There's a look a boy gets
when he's been shot
or a... or a land mine
takes off his legs,
and he's laying there
in the mud, trying to get up,
'cause he doesn't feel it yet.
I, uh, don't... his... his brain
hasn't caught up with the reality,
which is...
He's already dead.
Ed.
He's scaring me.
But we see it, the rest of us.
And we lie.
We say, "lay still.
You're gonna be fine."
If you'd been to war,
you'd know the look.
See, you and Peggy,
you got the look.
You still think it's Tuesday.
You have no idea what's coming.
Lou, I'm...
Really trying to be straight
with you here.
We hit some ice.
And...
That's all. I mean,
it could've happened to anyone.
Ed wasn't even speeding.
That man you hit,
his name was rye gerhardt.
Hit a tree...
we told ya.
I-I mean, we were arguing,
and ed turned his head.
It happened in a flash.
Rye gerhardt.
And his family hurts people
for money.
And they're coming.
May be here already.
And my point is
'cause I'm tired of talking...
if you did something, you made
a mistake, you panicked,
maybe covered it up, now is
the time to say... right now.
'Cause we can still fix this.
But if I'm right,
that window's closing,
and you may already be dead.
Look...
this is...
you're out of line.
I mean, we...
We want you to leave.
And no offense,
but we're asking you to leave.
Is that true, ed?
Ed? Is that true?
You asking me to leave?
You know, Lou, that's probably
for the best, yeah.
It was an accident, that's all.
That's all it was.
Okay.
Do yourself a favor...
lock the door.
Bear: Ma.
Everyone's together.
We need to know.
What do you want to do?
It's war.
Hon?
Yeah, it's me.
You should go back to bed, huh?
You expecting someone?
Not really.
Couldn't sleep.
I think you got the real pill.
Yeah?
You hope or you think?
We're just out of balance.
You and me?
Whole world.
Used to know right from wrong...
A moral center.
Now...
You should go in to bed.
I'm gonna sit out here
for a while,
make sure we're...
i don't know... safe.
Down in the Willow garden
Where me and my true love
did meet
It was there
we went a-courting
My love fell off to sleep
I had a bottle
of burgundy wine
My true love,
she did not know
It was there I murdered
that dear little girl
Down on the banks below
