You're never scared.
Except when you're scared.
Then I guess you're really scared.
I guess I'm really scared.
WOMAN: So why don't you just
get the hell out of here?
We'll both feel better.
CAPTAIN: Yeah, right.
Look, I can take this trip alone.
No!
No.

No! It's gotta be a mistake!

For that they give me

Escape is impossible.
That's nada. Short-term, man.
You're only taking a nap.
I never nap.
VVhaFd they get you for?
My wife was carrying
her second child.
One wasn't enough'?
He died at birth.

Lucky? What did they give you'?
You're smiling!
How the fuck can you be smiling'?
She got away.

ZED'. Laser perimeter intrusion.
Step back, please.
Smart fish. Very smart.
You know, the two of you
gotta pay the rent.
I do my own time.
There's all kinds of time.
Think about it.
You don't pay the rent,
me and Maddox come and get it.
That you?
No. Maddox is hard to miss.
He's got a 187
tattooed on his forehead.
Do you know what 187 means, fish?
Bet it's not your IQ.
GOMEZ: 187. Murder statute.
He's doin' the big bitch.
So maybe you wanna
pay the rent after all.
Brennick. John.

Anywhere you like, man.
Hey, pretty-boy. If your culo's

Huh? Oh, he's a ghost.
Got himself...mind-wiped. Go ahead.
He tried to escape. Big mistake.
The mistake is when
you don't make it.
Nobody makes it out of

Don't believe

I can't...
I can't stand here anymore.
I can't. I gotta get
out of here, man.
Hey, then fry, you little fuck!
Come on, man. You can do it.
ZED'. Are you ready
to identify the perpetrator?
Aaaarrhhh!
I gotta get out of here, man!
Think about being strong!
I am.
You tell 'em, you're dead!
Shut your mouth!
I'm gum in!
ZED'. 915764, are you ready
to identify the perpetrator?
No.
No.
"I...
"I...
It was...
BRENNICK: I did it!
ZED'. Prisoner Brennick, report
to Director Poe immediately.
Sit down, 95763.
My name is Brennick.
Of course it is.
Make yourself comfortable.
I am comfortable.
I believe you're acquainted
with Abraham.
He is the very best of our trustees.
I have written some excellent
parole recommendations,
but in all honesty,
I don't know what I would do
if Abraham were to leave us.
John Brennick.
The most decorated captain
in the history of the Black Berets.
Yet you quit in disgrace.
Didn't you?
Lost an entire platoon, I believe.
No business of yours!
So touchy.
I suppose that's understandable.
But still...
...you would not want to lose
this particular former soldier,
would you?
We caught her before she reached
the far side of the bridge.
The law is clear.
One child per woman.
We live on a very small
and fragile planet.
We must maintain
the population balance.
Abortion is illegal, and that
leaves only one alternative.

Intestinate Karen Brennick.
KAREN: Atnﬂiiul
BRENNICK: You bastard!
POE: Zed.
Aaaarrhhh! Aaaarrhhh...
I don't think you realise
your predicament, Brennick.
POE: You have nothing.
You have nowhere to hide.
You are nothing.
I fucked up.
I couldn't handle it, man.
I know.
BRENNICK: You better watch yourself.
HeY--'
...where's the women's section?
Don't even think about it.
Why? Gonna give your boss a report?
He's got his little sisters.

Where's the women's section?

You die right here

Ain't that a bitch'?

and you're just like
everybody else in here.
You didn't answer my question.
Fuck you.
Levels A...
...and B.
KAREN: What is it?
The baby's kicking.
I can feel her kicking.
That's fine. It's natural.
I just wanna. . . hold my baby
for a little while.
I know I can't keep her.
But just to see her open her eyes.
I know.
I'm not gonna let them...
take my baby.
Oh, no...
Aaaarrhhh!
MAN: Stop her!
Into the operating room.
Come on, take it easy.

Your sentimentality is touching.
But quite foolish, Brennick.
Let 'em go! Now!
You fucking asshole!

POE: Hold your fire, Zed.
Intestinate John Brennick.
Aaaaarrhhhh!
Random intestination.
Come on! Karen, come on!
ZED'. Take John Brennick
to Isolation to await punishment.
I owe you an apology.

Come on, move out!
Oh, shit, man! Look at...
Oh, man!

This is Brennick's bed now.
Oh, yeah? Since when?
Since your friend
got blasted by the splatter gun!
Dickhead!
You look awful.
That bad?
KAREN: Worse.
I was clumsy.
I ran into a brick wall.
Only the wall was moving.
Yoda.
Poe says I should
tell you to cooperate.
You just told me.
He says it's gonna be
very bad if you don't.
Midi!-
He says if I care about you at all,
I would beg you to listen.
What do you say?
I want my husband.
You got him.
John, no matter what you do,
I'll never not love you.
You're real lousy at goodbyes,
you know that?
I always have been.
ZED: Commence procedure.
Nooooooooo!
John, help me!
Please!
Noooooooooooo!
He's been in there for three days.
And no-one has ever lasted four.
KAREN: There's a first time
for everything.
It is in your power
to stop his pain.
But there's a price.
I want you to...
...live here.
To share my quarters
for the remainder of your stay.
Why me?
Why does this music
give me pleasure?
I don't know.
I skipped music appreciation.
L'In...
...looking for a companion.
I'm not real friendly
to anyone who tortures my husband!
Stop it!
Stop it!
You...
What?
Yes, you bastard! Just let him go!
Release John Brennick
from Mind VVipe.
Return him to his cell.
Mother of God!
What have they done to him?
D-DAY: He's a ghost, man.
He's gone.
Bullshit, man! He's breathing!
ABRAHAM: The mind is dead.
The body just don't know it yet.
Welcome home, baby.
Just a moment longer, Zed.
This is a fascinating dream.
Quite instructive,
regarding the...
prisoner psychology.
ZED: The presence
of the Brennick
is causing you to act
in a non-professional manner.
POE: She's none of your business.
POE: I make my own decisions, Zed.
POE: This is an unauthorised
thought process.
It's a very advanced model, isn't it?
Yes, you were a...computer
technician in the army.
I never got near
anything as powerful as Zed.
Of course not. No-one has.
Don't touch her!
If I ever see you so much as
lay a finger on her keyboard
or utter a single voice command,
you and your child will feel a pain
unknown in human history.
Don't touch him, asshole!
You motherfucker!
What the fuck does he care?
He did it to his own fucking self!
No! They did it!
And what are you gonna do about it?
Yeah, right.
What are you?
I am enhanced.
You're not human. You're...
POE: A monster?
A freak?
The Men-Tel Corporation
has transformed me into a more...
...efficient human being.
Once a month, I absorb amino acids,
wasting neither food nor fuel.
When my kind are in the majority,
there will be no more world hunger.
Maw-
You don't sleep, you don't eat...
You can't make love, can you?
But I can love.
Are there others like you?
Not many as advanced, but...yes.
I was one of Men-TeFs first babies.
It was very special.
Oh, my God! You're what they do
with our babies!
Of course.
I saw your wife, Cap.
I saw Karen.
She's getting larger.
You can tell she's pregnant now.
She felt the baby move.
No, no. You know I cannot.
Oh...
...I know.
But have you ever tried'?
This is. . .very special.
I wonder why
I've never tried this before.
How do you feel?
Very happy!
John.
Johnny.
Come here, Johnny. Come here...
Come here, Johnny.
You don't have to be afraid.
Karen?
That's it.
John.
I'm right here, John.
POE: Karen!
Karen, where are you?
Right here.
I must...be more...moderate...
...in the future.
ZED'. Good morning,
Cell Block Orange, Level F.
30 minutes before
reporting for work.
Somebody...
...get Brennick up.
BRENNICK: I'm awake.
Holy fuck! You're alive!
Shh! Shhh.
How long was I out?
Four months.
D-DAY: No, it's true, man.
You were long gone.
Alright...
When.
I'm OK. I'm OK.
Wait a minute.
I've been in here that long?
Karen's getting near term.
Don't worry about that.
She's alright.
Did you see her?
Are you strong enough
for the truth'?
Karen moved into Poe's quarters.
That's why he didn't kill you.
No!
She saved herself.
She's closer to the way out.
You'll never get in there.
You do.
That's my job.
I thought I made it clear to you,
I got a parole to worry about.
I'm not gonna jeopardise that
so you can play
some great escape bullshit!
I'm not playing-.
We need to talk.
Talk's dangerous.
That's right. It is.
I've been talking to your husband.
I'm John's cellmate.
All this time you
could of told me...
All this time
he has been like a zombie.
Just staring into space
like nothing was there.
Until today.
It worked?
It worked!
Oh, thank God!
I don't know what you did...
...but now he's planning an escape.
Nobody has ever gotten out of here.
He's a good man.
I don't want to see him die.
He won't die. Not if I help him.
I don't know how,
but this is gonna get Karen out.
Let me see that, Cap'n.
Look, I know about these things.
Let me see it.
I'm gonna have to
take it apart, but...
Can you put it back together?
Oh, man. Machines love me, man!
I can take it apart, put it back,
make it tick, yeah!
It's what I did in the world, man!
Mechanic?
No, no. Explosives.
First Intercontinental Bank building.
I blew that safe like
it was fucking butter, man!
Only problem was my partners
didn't appreciate my work.
Turned my ass in.
VVell, shit, man,
I blew up the money.
Don't fuck it up.
POE: New pods will be completed
next month.
POE: VVeK/e had some problems
with the bedrock.
ZED'. Five new levels must be ready
by the end of the year.
POE: Yes, yes, yes,
I am aware of that.
Reset your clock, Zed.
All work hours are now 93 minutes.
What are you doing awake?
Oh...l couldn't sleep.
For the sake of our baby
you must get your rest.
D-DAY: Wow!
Oh, man... Oh, man...
Shit... Shit!
What?
This thing is amazing, Cap'n.
She's beautiful!
This thing is a work of genius, man.
Look at this. Look right here.
This is a series of micros.
That's your pain mode, alright?
And this thing right here
is a macro.
That kills you.
And look at this
little itty-bitty thing on top.
That's your nerve clip, man.
I need you to put it back together.
I'm... I'm working on it, man.
And get it out of me.
Look, Captain,
I may be able to set off
a series of charges in this thing,
cause you to throw it up,
but the major drawback on that
is that this bitch is highly sensitive.
We're talking TNT on PMS.
You mean it could kill me?
Definite possibility.
Find another way.
Maybe there is no other way.
VVrong answer. Try again.
If I get it...
When you get it.
When I get it,
I'm going with you, man.
Look, I'm having fun, man.
I'm enjoying myself.
You know how long it's been
since I had any fun?
Going out won't be fun.
No, but...man, it's gonna be a trip.
All you've got to do
is take it to him.
All? All? Fuck the dumb shit.
That is a pretty big all.
Look, I know it's dangerous,
but I'm asking you anyway.
Let's say I don't get mind-wiped?
VVhaFs gonna happen to my parole?
Truth is you're not gonna
get a parole, and you know it.
You hold on to the hope
because you're a man,
because you keep something inside
of you none of them can touch.
But this is your chance
to fight back.
Fight for who? You? Your husband?
I've never begged before in my life.
Please, Abraham. Please.
If you won't do this for me,
do this for my baby.
I gotta get this back
before he finds out.
GOMEZ: What is it?
it's a map.
Haven't you guys ever seen
a holographic lens before?
Only problem is we need a laser
to make this thing work.
We got a laser.
You gonna stick your hand in there?
Now that's entertainment.
We need something to hold it.
Hey, wait a minute. Take that.
We got something.
I'll be goddamned!
Whoa!
Look.
This could be a way out.
D-DAY:
Hold it steady!
I'm any, um.
This thing is just heating up.
Sorry.
We go in through
the construction area here.
Through this heating pipe. See?
It feeds into this utility shaft,
which goes all the way up...
D-DAY: Shit! Wait a second.
Ow! No!
Shit!
Q'-
We don't get that fuckin' lens,
we're all dead.
Fuck the lens.
I need my glasses, man.
Move over.
Did you get it, man?
BRENNICK: Aaarrrrgghh!
ZED'. Laser perimeter intrusion.
Step back, please.
Shit, man, don't you hurt?
Yeah!
How's the lens?
It's fine. The motherfucker's fine.
Whoa!
You should see what you fools
look like through this thing, man!
WOW!
POE: I want you...
...to divorce your husband.
That's not part of our bargain.
He will never leave this place.
You will never see him again.
He's become a cog
in the Fortress's grand design.
Let me show you.
Your husband is but one of many
whose only reason for being
is the expansion of our facility.
Hon.
Have you touched this?
No.
I noticed there was dust on the lens
so I thought it'd be best
if I clean it.
You fool, you smudged it!
Do you know what it will cost
to repair this map?
I beg your indulgence.
This will have a bearing
on your parole!
I'm sorry.
Divorce your husband.
Marry me.
And I will request permission
from the Men-Tel Corporation
to raise the child as my own.
I'm telling you...
...I will not enhance your child.
Does this mean nothing'?
And John?
I will set him free.
Karen has to tell the man
yes or no by tomorrow night.
Good. We go tomorrow morning.
Hey! Time's up.
I think I got it, man.
Check this out.
Right there. Now look.
Here's something, yeah?
It's a magnetic detonator!
So'?
Didn't you go to grade school?
You get two magnets,
put a piece of paper in between,
You can pull it out of us!
Well, yeah... In theory.
I haven't tried it yet.
I may just set it off,
give this cell a coat of red paint.
I don't know.
Let's find out.
What, you mean like right now'?
You got a better time?
No, man!
You turn into a burrito
and what happens to the rest of us'?
STIGGS: Try me.
I'm going with you.
GOMEZ: No way!
Look, you gonna do it...
...or what?
OK.
Er...
This might hurt a little bit, OK?
Where are you, man?
I Q I.
Quit...fucking around, you asshole!
God! Shit!
Oh...God...
Oh, God. Get it out of me.
Asshole!
Hey, hey, hey, no hurry, no worry.
Stop fooling around!
Get the damn thing out of him!
Yeah? VVhds fooling around?
I can't get this thing. it's stuck.
Come here.
I can't...
Come here.
What are you...?
Fuck. Fuck. Oh.
It's OK.
OK.
My turn.
Alright, man.
Somebody take notes, man.
After I finish with you, I won't
be able to do this on myself.
I'll do it to you.
After you do it to me.
What about your parole?
Parole? Bullshit.
It's time I woke up.
I'm going with you.
No. it's too much of a risk.
Afraid?
Afraid you'll lose us'?
Like you lost your platoon?
I don't ever want to be responsible
for another man's life again.
Hey, man...
...I'll speak for myself.
But it's better to die trying
than to die in here.
Right on, man.
Fuckin' A.
I haven't dreamt in 4O years.
