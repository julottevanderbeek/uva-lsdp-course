HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING

EVERY DAY.  IF YOU DON'T FEED
THE ANIMALS, WHAT HAPPENS ?
THEY DIE.
THEY DIE,
RIGHT ?
THIS IS CALLED
PASTA PUTTANESCA.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS ?
THAT MEANS
BAD GIRL'S PASTA,

AS TO WHERE YOU GO.
YOU HAVE EACH BEEN GIVEN
AN EXTRA BATTERY.
SO THERE SHOULD BE
ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE...
WHEN YOU GET
A PAGE...
THAT YOU WILL
ANSWER IT IMMEDIATELY.
YES.
YES, SIR.
YOU WILL NOT CARRY
ANY OTHER PAGERS WITH YOU.
YOU WILL NOT,
FOR THAT MATTER,
CARRY ANYTHING...
OTHER THAN WHAT
I HAVE JUST GIVEN YOU.
- KEYS ?
- WHAT ?
WHAT ABOUT MY HOUSE KEYS ?
THAT WAY I CAN GET BACK IN.
I COULD LEAVE 'EM WITH YOU.
WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO.
YOU'RE CALLIN' THE SHOTS.
YOU CAN CARRY YOUR KEYS.
YOU WILL NOT MENTION
MY NAME...
OR IMPLY THAT YOU
ARE IN MY EMPLOY.
YOU WILL NOT
SPEAK TO ANYONE
WHEN YOU ARE WORKING.
WHEN YOU ARE NOT WORKING,
YOU ARE CONSIDERED
TO BE ON CALL...
AND AVAILABLE
THAT MEANS THAT YOU
DO NOT GET DRUNK...
OR DO ANYTHING
THAT WILL PREVENT YOU...
FROM OPERATING
IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER.
THERE IS A NUMBER
IN YOUR PAGER'S MEMORY.
IT IS A CAR SERVICE.
IF THEY CALL YOU UP AND THEY
ASK YOU THE ACCOUNT,
YOU SAY "CARDIFF GIANT."
THEY WILL COME
AND THEY WILL
PICK YOU UP...
AND TAKE YOU
WHEREVER YOU
WANT TO GO.
THAT MEANS THAT
THERE IS NO DESTINATION
THAT YOU CANNOT REACH...
WITHIN 15 MINUTES.
FIFTEEN MINUTES.
IS THERE A PATTERN
FORMING HERE ?
ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH.
WHAT IS IT ?
- YOU WANT US TO BE
WHEREVER YOU WANT--
- LET HIM TELL ME.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I GOT IT.
TELL ME.  WHAT IS IT ?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU'RE PICKING ON ME, MAX.
BECAUSE YOU LOST
MY FUCKIN'
CARPET-CLEANING VAN,
AND I DON'T LIKE YOU,
YOU COCKSUCKER !
I PARKED THE VAN AND
LEFT IT FOR FIVE MINUTES,
YOU WANT US TO BE...
WHEREVER YOU WANT US TO BE
A.S.A.P.
I LOCKED IT,
PUT THE CLUB ON IT--
YES.  GOOD-BYE.
WHAT AM I DROPPING OFF
ON THE TRIP ?
WHAT'S THE--
WHAT ARE WE--
GOOD-BYE !
HERE WE ARE.
3D AND G.
I THINK YOU GOT IT WRONG, BOB.
THAT'S MINE.  I'M IN 3D.
YOU'RE RIGHT HERE, 3G.
THEY'RE BOTH AISLES.
WHAT'S THE--
I WAS ASSIGNED THAT SEAT.
I LIKE TO FOLLOW THE RULES.
OKAY.
YOU'RE IN 3G,
AND I'M IN 3D.
ALL RIGHT.  OKAY.
OH, MAN.  SEE,
WHEN YOU'RE IN WITH MAXIE,
HE TAKES CARE OF YOUR SHIT.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ?
STRETCH IT OUT, KEEP IT NICE.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT ELSE.
BEATS THE HELL OUT OF
CLEANING CARPETS.
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.
COMFORTABLE, COMFORTABLE,
COMFORTABLE.
I WONDER WHAT THE MOVIE IS.
I'LL ASK THE LADY
WHAT THE MOVIE IS.
DON'T BUG HER.
THEY LIKE TO HELP.
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE HERE FOR.
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.
DON'T CARRY GUILT WITH IT.
CHAMPAGNE OR ORANGE JUICE ?
OH, PERFECT.
WHAT A WONDERFUL KICKOFF
TO THE TRIP.  CHEERS.
OKAY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
UH, OOH.  OKAY.
MY BUTTON DOWN HERE.
I LOVE
THIS SHIT, MY MAN.
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING
I'M TALKING ABOUT.
YOU WITH ME ?
GIVE ME IT.
RIGHT HERE.
YES ?
YEAH, I WAS
JUST WONDERING...
EXCUSE ME.
SORRY.
WHAT THE MOVIE WAS TONIGHT.
IT'S IN YOUR COPY
OFAMBASSADOR.
I BELIEVE IT'S
MICKEY BLUE EYES.
UGH.
I CAN BRING YOU
A LIST OF VIDEOS.
I JUST WANT TO OFFER THE OTHER
PASSENGERS A DRINK FIRST.
THAT'S GREAT.
WHAT'S THE OVERHEAD
ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT ?
WHAT'S THE ACTION
THAT'S GONNA COME MY WAY ?
WHAT'S THE ACTION THAT'S
GONNA COME YOUR WAY ?
YEAH.
WHAT'S IT GONNA COST ME
FOR THE VIDEOS ?
OH, NO.
YOU'RE UP FRONT.
EVERYTHING'S FREE UP HERE.
OH !  WONDERFUL,
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL.
SEE THAT SHIT ?
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT--  SEE, NOW--
THEY SET YOU UP.
THEY DROP THIS ON YOU.
I BET THERE'S A HIDDEN TAX.
EXCUSE ME, SWEETIE.
YES.
EXCUSE ME.
WHERE THE DRINKS
ARE CONCERNED,
IS THAT A HIDDEN TAX ?
DOES THAT FALL UNDER
THE COMPLIMENTARY SERVICE, OR IS
THAT SOMETHING YOU PAY FOR ?
NO, NO.  THEY'RE COMPLIMENTARY.
WOULD YOU CARE FOR ANOTHER ONE ?
THEY'RE COMPLIMENTARY.
YOU BET YOUR ASS I WOULD.
YES.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I APPRECIATE IT.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
CAN I GET A CUTTY
ON THE ROCKS TOO ?
IS THAT COMPLIMENTARY ?
YES, YES.
CHEERS, MAN.
YOU HEAR THAT SHIT ?
EVERYTHING UP HERE
IS FREE.
OKAY.
YOU CAN DRINK AS MUCH
AS YOU WANT UP FRONT,
HAVE A NICE FLING,
WE GET OUR VIDEOS GOING.
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE ON CALL,
WE COULD DRINK AS MUCH AS WE
WANT, BUT WE REALLY SHOULDN'T.
OH, YEAH, BECAUSE THEY'RE
PROBABLY GONNA PAGE US...
AND ASK US TO WHACK OUT
THE PILOT UP FRONT.
UNLESS WE HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO
IN THE NEXT FIVE HOURS,
WE COULD SIT HERE,
HAVE DRINKS, RELAX LIKE
GENTLEMEN AND ENJOY OURSELVES...
AND ACTUALLY HAVE FUN
WITH THE TRIP,
TRUE.
VERSUS COMPLAINING ABOUT THE
TRIP AND EVERY TIME I SIT DOWN,
IT'S YOUR SEAT, MY SEAT.
AS LONG AS WE DON'T
SHOW UP HAMMERED--
AS LONG AS WE DON'T TALK
TO SOMEONE LIKE A SCHOOLTEACHER,
WE HAVE FUN.
WE HAVE TO REPRESENT MAX.
THAT'S ALL WE HAVE TO DO.
I'M REPRESENTING FUCKING MAX.
COULD YOU STOP
WITH THE--
YES.  EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

WHERE YOU'RE LOCATED.
WHERE'S YOUR HOME ?

POOL PARTY THING ?

IF YOU'RE THE SULTAN OF BRUNEI.
NO MAN TALKS TO ME

NOW, YOU CAN EITHER
LEARN SOME MANNERS,
OR I CAN MAKE A FORMAL COMPLAINT
TO THE AIRPORT AUTHORITIES...
AND WE CAN SORT THIS OUT
WHILE YOU'RE WAITING STANDBY
FOR THE NEXT FLIGHT TO KENNEDY.
OKAY.  YEAH.

SO THEY DON'T KNOW
SHE'S INTO MY SHIT ?
LET'S SORT IT OUT NOW.

SO WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US ?
WHAT DO YOU NEED US TO DO ?

NOW, HERE'S THE PLAN.
YEAH.
TAKE THE MONEY
TO THE WELSHMAN.
HE'S GONNA CHECK IT.
HE'S GONNA HAND YOU HIS MARKER,
AND YOU'RE DONE.  THAT'S IT.
AS LONG AS YOU

YOU'RE TIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
WHEN IS THE DROP ?
NOW, YOU THREE,
Y'ALL GONNA SET UP
DINNER WITH HIM ?
THERE YOU GONNA FIND OUT
IF AND WHERE.

FOR THIS THING ?
OUTFIT ?  WHAT THE FUCK
IS HE TALKING ABOUT ?
I REALIZE YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO HAVE ME STRAPPED IN CASE
THERE'S A SITUATION.
STRAPPED ?  THE LAST PERSON
I WANT WITH A GUN IS YOU.
PLEASE DON'T GIVE THIS
MOTHERFUCKER NO GUN.
THIS IS AS ROUTINE AS IT GETS.
I COULD'VE TURNED IT OFFSHORE,
BUT MAXIE LIKES TO DO IT
HIS WAY-- SAFE.
I COULD'VE
DROPPED THE BAG MYSELF.
IT'S ONLY 200 GS.
BUT HE SENT YOU TWO.
SO I CAN EITHER
CALL MAXIE AND TELL HIM
HOW YOU FUCKED UP,
SEND YOUR ASSES HOME,
OR WE CAN FLUSH IT DOWN
THE TOILET ONE MORE TIME,
SEE IF IT GOES DOWN.
LOOK, MAN,  ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS MEET THE WELSH GUY.
MAKE HIM FEEL COMFORTABLE.
DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.
DRINK SOME TEA.  WHATEVER
THE FUCK THEY DO IN SCOTLAND
OR WHEREVER HE'S FROM.
MAKE HIM FEEL COMFORTABLE
TILL HE BRINGS UP THE DROP
ON HIS OWN.
YOU MAKE THE DROP, WE'RE ON
A PLANE BACK TO CALIFORNIA,
FUCKIN' HOS OFF MELROSE.
WHEN'S
THIS MEETING ?
PARK AVENUE.
WE NEED GUNS.
I'M TELLING YOU.
WE DON'T NEED GUNS.
I'M PRETTY SURE
WE NEED GUNS.
THEY SPECIFICALLY SAID
WE DO NOT NEED GUNS.
THAT'S ALL THE MORE REASON...
WHY YOU DO NEED A GUN.
YOU COULDN'T EVEN
GET A GUN.
YOU WANNA BET ME ?
YOU COULDN'T EVEN
GET A HAND JOB FROM
THE BRIDGE-AND-TUNNEL POSSE.
THAT FUCKIN' GIRL
HAD PERSONAL ISSUES
WITH THE BATHTUB.
NOW FLOAT ME 100 BUCKS.
WHY ?
WANNA SEE HOW FAST
I CAN GET A GUN ?
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR MONEY ?
I HAVE SOME STUFF LEFT.

CAN WE CALM DOWN, PLEASE,
AND TRY TO
TALK ABOUT IT CIVILIZED
AND HAVE A DISCUSSION ?
ALL I'M SAYING
IS I VOUCHED FOR YOU,
RICKY, AND YOU FUCKED ME.
THIS IS PEANUTS COMPARED
TO WHAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE
DOWN THE ROAD.
I DON'T WANNA
MAKE MONEY DOWN THE ROAD.
THIS IS IT FOR ME.
I WANNA TAKE THIS MONEY
SO JESS DOESN'T HAVE TO
GRIND HER ASS...
INTO MEN'S ERECTIONS
TO PUT HER KID
THROUGH PRIVATE SCHOOL.
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.
YOU STUCK UP FOR ME
TO BE ON THIS TRIP.
I RESPECT THAT.  I'M SORRY
IF I'VE CAUSED YOU PROBLEMS.
I SEE THINGS
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE SEEING.
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU,
OKAY ?
OKAY.
IT JUST COULD'VE BEEN EASY
IF WE HANDLED IT DIFFERENTLY.
LET'S GET SOME SLEEP.
WE'RE GONNA FEEL BETTER.
WE CAN'T SLEEP.
WE GOT THREE HOURS.
THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD
SPEND THIS TIME GETTING GUNS.
SEE ?  YOU'RE CRAZY.
WE DON'T WANT A GUN.
THAT'S GONNA GET US KILLED.
YOU KNOCKED THE JEW'S TOOTH OUT.
THAT'S GONNA COST MAX
EIGHT GRAND, MAYBE MORE.
YOU PROBABLY LOST HIM
HIS WHOLE LINE OF CLIENTELE TOO.
YOU'VE FUCKED UP JESS'S DANCING.
I THINK HE KNOWS
I SOLD THE FUCKIN' CARPET VAN.
HE'S BEEN GIVING ME LOOKS.
HE CAN'T KILL US IN LOS ANGELES
'CAUSE THERE'S QUESTIONS,

YOU KNOW,
YOU BOYS DID GOOD.
I NEVER INTENDED TO TEST YOU

BUT YOU COME THROUGH.
I COULD'VE USED A CALL.
RUIZ SAID NOT TO CALL.
I'LL TAKE THAT UP WITH RUIZ.
YOU GOT THE MONEY,
THOUGH ?
THE MONEY COME THROUGH.
I COULD'VE USED A CALL.
AS FOR YOU, RICKY,
YOUR DRAW,
THAT'S GONNA GO
TO A NEW CARPET-CLEANING VAN.
I WALKED INTO A ROOM
FULL OF FUCKIN' WESTIES
FOR THAT.
IF THEY WERE WESTIES,
YOU'D BE DEAD.
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
WE'RE SQUARE.
AS FOR YOU, BOBBY,
YOUR DAYS OF FIGHTING
FOR CRUMBS ARE OVER.
TAKE A WEEK, COME BACK,
WE'LL TALK ABOUT
THE NEXT THING.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
GONNA BE A NEXT THING, MAX.
TAKE A FEW DAYS.
I DON'T NEED A FEW DAYS.
I'M THROUGH, AND JESS
IS THROUGH DANCING FOR YOU.

I HATE TO, UH--
I HATE TO BREAK UP
YOUR, UH,
FANTASY DREAM,
OR WHATEVER THE FUCK IT IS,
BUT I'VE BEEN
PAYING JESSICA'S RENT
FOR EIGHT MONTHS.
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.
WE'RE GONNA BE LEAVING NOW.

A LOT GOING ON.
BUT THERE ALWAYS IS,
ISN'T THERE--
A LOT GOING ON ?
MMM.
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I AM SURE GLAD THAT
THAT FUCKIN' VAN
IS OUT OF THE WAY.
IT WAS HANGING OVER MY HEAD
FOR TOO LONG.
BOBBY CAN BE
A LITTLE HASTY SOMETIMES.
YOU SAID WHAT TO HIM ?
"WAIT A FEW DAYS."
SMART.  LET'S LET HIM
WAIT A FEW DAYS.
I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND HOLD ONTO THIS FOR HIM.
KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF THE MONEY.
MAYBE HE'LL DECIDE--
OKAY.  OKAY.
DON'T TOUCH THE MONEY !
LEAVE THE MONEY RIGHT THERE.
MY POINT BEING--
GET THE FUCK OUT.
UNDERSTOOD, BUT IF HE CHANGES
HIS MIND, CAN HE COME BACK--
GET THE FUCK OUT.
OKAY.  OKAY.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
ASSHOLE.
I'LL CHECK ON THE GIRLS.

IN CASE YOU WANNA LEAVE.

WHAT YOU GOTTA DO,
BUT THAT LITTLE GIRL OUT THERE
IS SUCH A SPECIAL PERSON--

HEY, CHLOE.

DON'T SPEND $10,000
