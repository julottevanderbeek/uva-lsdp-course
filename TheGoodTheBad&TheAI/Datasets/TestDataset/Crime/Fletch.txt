My name is Erwin Fletcher.
I'm an investigative reporter
for a Los Angeles paper.
You've probably read my stuff
under the byline of Jane Doe.
Iùs better than Erwin.
Recently I've been
loitering around the beach...
trying to pass for
a minor league junkie.
I don't nod out or drool;
thaùs too obvious.
Act like you don't care
and you fit right in.
Business has really picked up.
I'm still closed.
Is it a Colombian national holiday?
What do you figure, Sam?
No idea.
- No idea at all?
- Some idea.
Like when?
When it comes, it comes.
I got some reds.
You don't mean communists,
do you?
Is everything a joke
to you, Fletch?
Everything, Sam.
- Hey, Gummy!
- Hey, Fletch. Hey, Sam.
How's the eye?
Iùs OK.
The cops did it.
They always
beating up on me.
- He doesn't know.
- Son of a bitch!
Thaùs what he said.
He doesn't know?
How come he doesn't know?
I don't know.
He just doesn't know.
Son of a bitch!
I wonder how he
gets the stuff.
I have no idea.
Sam never leaves the beach.
He sits in that chair.
He's out of shit.
Suddenly he gets up,
he's got shit.
Where's it coming from?
The sand?
Thaùs highly unlikely, Grease.
I oughta get some sleep.
Grease, how old are you?
Nineteen.
You're not taking
very good care of yourself.
If you haven't guessed, there's been
a lot of drug traffic on the beach.
I'm not talking about No-Doze.
I talkin' about the hard stuff.
A lot of it.
I've been trying to find out
who's behind it.
It hasn't been easy.
I don't shower much.
Excuse me. I have something
I'd like to discuss with you.
- Whaùs that?
- We can't talk about it here.
- Why not?
- Because we can't.
You on a scavenger hunt, or did I
forget to pay my dinner check?
Come to my house
to talk.
Wrong gal, fella.
I'll give you
$1,000 cash.
What?
Come to my house
and listen to the proposition.
If you reject the proposition,
you keep the thousand...
and your mouth shut.
Does this entail
my dressing up as Little Bo Peep?
- Iùs nothing of a sexual nature.
- Yeah.
One thousand just to listen?
How can you pass that up,
Mister...
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Alan Stanwyk.
Alan, charmed.
For an extra grand, I'll let you
take me out to dinner.
What a coincidence.
What?
I almost bought
this place.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy
killed himself here. Blew it for me.
- Who?
- Hopalong Cassidy.
Bow and arrow.
Very weird.
Are you doped up?
Don't talk to me like that.
I don't work for you.
- Buenos dÌas.
- Buenos dÌas.
Pup 'N' Taco.
Oh, you've remodeled
the garage.
Must have
cost you hundreds.
Good idea.
I oughta frame mine.
Will the Pope
be in later?
Here's my proposition.
I'm all ears.
I want you
to murder me.
Here...
on Thursday.
I'd like you
to shoot me dead.
The reason
I ask for this service...
is because I'm already facing
a very long...
painful and most certain death.
You see, I have bone cancer.
I don't know if you
know about bone cancer.
Iùs the worst kind you can get.
It just eats you up
bit by bit.
You don't look sick.
I don't feel sick. Not yet.
Iùll get bad
in a month.
After that, I'd rather
not be around for it.
Why not try suicide?
I've thought about it.
My company's taken out
a large life insurance policy on me.
Suicide would nullify it,
but murder does not.
- Why me?
- You're a drifter.
A, uh... pardon the expression...
a junkie.
Nobody would notice
if you disappeared.
I've been watching you
for a couple of weeks.
Maybe I'm
just on vacation.
Not with the scum
you hang out with.
No, I've watched...
and I've thought.
Iùs an elegant plan.
I've even figured out
your escape.
Swell.
Has it ever occurred to you
I might not want to murder you?
I've got $50,000
says you will.
And a guarantee you
won't get caught.
I'm still here.
I want it done Thursday
around 8:00 p.m.
My wife will be out,
and iùs the staff's night off.
- These will be open.
- Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Sometimes. The staff
usually forgets.
I have the same trouble
with my help.
I'll be here
waiting for you.
The safe will be open.
There will be
$50,000 in it.
You'll be wearing rubber gloves.
Do you own rubber gloves?
I rent 'em. I have
a lease with an option to buy.
Now in this drawer...
Ah!
A.357 Magnum.
My.357. You use it.
No one can trace it to you.
The room will be
in disarray.
Like a burglary attempt?
You come in and catch me
stealing your ties and money?
We scuffle. The gun
gets loose and I shoot you.
Precisely.
- Are you a good shot?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
Get me on the first shot,
if you can.
- Do you have a passport?
- Can dig one up.
Good. Now, after you kill me,
take the Jaguar.
The keys will be
in the glove compartment.
- Take it where?
- L.A.X.
Pan Am will have a ticket for you.
- Where am I going?
- Rio.
It departs at 11 p.m.
They serve dinner onboard?
And a movie and drinks.
Stay down there
for a year.
So?
So...
You certainly
thought this out.
I don't leave
a great deal to chance.
Those will be open?
Take care of the gloves,
the passport and the aim.
I'll handle
everything else.
The gun, the money,
the tickets...
and the dying.
Thaùs right.
Looks like you
get the hard part.
What do you say?
You'll be doing me
a great service.
Will you kill me?
Sure.
Hey! Good to see you.
Slouch,
how are you?
Can I steal you?
If you promise
not to return me.
- Magic today?
- Yeah, Kareem's in the wash.
I need a favor.
- Fletch!
- Did you hear something?
See what we have on Alan Stanwyk
in Beverly Hills.
I need this right away.
- I take it the story's done.
- W-Y-K.
Tell me I'm right.
You're right,
but you're very peaked.
Want to vomit?
Come on in.
- The story's done, right?
- Uh... almost.
Almost is not an answer.
Yes is an answer.
And a damn fine answer.
Professional journalism time now.
Go back and finish
the story!
Frank, I will.
I swear it.
Something came up.
You've got
a deadline tomorrow.
Did you see Sunday's ad?
I don't read the paper.
Whaùs the spread on tonighùs game?
- Lakers by six.
- Take a look.
Shame of the City.
Thaùs very nice.
Try to follow this.
You can't run the ad
and then not run the story.
You can't? Why not?
Shit. Really?
I'm putting you on. You'll get
the story. You'll be proud of it.
You broke it?
You know the source?
Practically.
Is it Fat Sam?
You said you had pictures of him.
- I do have pictures of him dealing.
- Leùs go. We'll run them.
You can't do that.
Fat Sam isn't the story.
There's a source behind him.
Who?
Thaùs a gray area.
How gray?
Charcoal.
May I help you with that?
OK. A little lighter.
Can you go higher?
Over to the right.
Higher. Perfect.
Nice and hard.
Thaùs good. Thank you.
- That it?
- Perfect.
Everything's recent.
Let me see that. Alan Stanwyk,
commercial airline pilot...
from Provo, Utah."
Formerly a test pilot,
member of the Jaycees.
- Move on?
- Yeah.
Married Boyd Aviation.
He's no dummy.
Thaùs big bucks.
His parents are Marvin and Velma,
were unable to attend the wedding.
Those are three names I enjoy:
Marvin, Velma and Provo.
Hold it there.
Cancer.
Cancer Society Benefit.
Internist Dr. Joseph Dolan.
I wonder if
thaùs his doctor.
One way to find out.
There is.
Where do you
know Alan from?
We play tennis
at the club.
California Racquet Club?
- Right.
- Thaùs my club too.
I don't remember
seeing you there.
I haven't been playing
because of these kidney pains.
Right. How long have you
had these pains, Mr. Barber?
No, thaùs Babar.
Two B's?
One B.
B-A-B-A-R.
- Thaùs two.
- Yeah, but not together.
I thought
thaùs what you meant.
Arnold Babar.
Aren't there
children's books...
about an elephant
named Babar?
- I don't know. I don't have any.
- No children?
No, elephant books.
Open wide.
Say, Ah.
Aah.
Iùs an odd name.
I haven't seen it
on the club registry.
I don't formally belong.
I'm a guest of my aunùs.
Your aunt?
- Right. Mrs. Smith.
- Joan or Margaret?
Uh-huh.
Which one?
Margaret.
Funny old bird.
I could tell you
some stories.
I bet.
You know,
iùs a shame about Ed.
It was.
That was really a shame.
To go so suddenly.
He was dying
for years.
But the end
was very sudden.
He was in intensive care
for eight weeks.
But the very end,
when he actually died...
was extremely sudden.
Alan and I were recently
speaking of dying.
He told me Boyd Aviation took out
a large insurance policy on him.
You've got to be
in perfect shape...
to get that sort
of a policy, I bet.
Drop your shorts
and bend over, Mr. Babar.
No, really.
We don't need to.
We don't want
to do that.
My kidneys feel better
in this position.
Maybe iùs that I'm not doing
any calisthenics.
If I did sit-ups
or bent over like this...
I'd feel 100% bet...
# Moon River ##
Whew! Thank you, Doc.
You ever serve time?
- Breathe easy.
- Breathe easy.
I was surprised Alan
got that policy.
There's a history of cancer
in the family.
- There is?
- Yeah.
As a matter of fact... Aah!
You using the whole fist?
Just relax.
I saw Alan the other day.
He was looking peaked.
Are you sure
he's all right?
I can't discuss another patient.
You know that.
Well, I don't find
anything wrong with you.
I'm sure iùs not
for a lack of looking.
I was anxious
to return to my drug story.
But since Dr. Jellyfinger
wasn't talking...
I had to find out
about Stanwyk's health.
May I help you, Dr., uh...
Dr. Rosenpenis. I'm here
to check Stanwyk's file.
Doctor who?
Dr. Rosenrosen.
Your name again.
Iùs Dr. Rosenhite.
Doctor who?
Dr. Rosen.
Where's the records room?
- Next to Pathology.
- Would you take care of these things?
I'd like to check
Alan Stanwyk's file.
Where the hell's
the records room?
Next to Pathology, B1.
Collate these for me.
Where did you say that was?
- B1.
- Thank you very much.
- Take the elevator.
- Thank you.
Give me a hand, Doctor.
Me?
Come on!
Yeah.
Have you ever seen a spleen
that large?
No, not since breakfast.
Here. Hold this.
I haven't sterilized
my hands.
You won't make him
any sicker.
I'll get it.
Ah, oh!
You never get used
to the smell, do ya?
Oh, Doctor.
Are you all right?
Where am I?
- The records room.
- The records room?
- I'm fine.
- Can I get you something?
Do you have
The Beatles' White Album?
Never mind. Get me
a glass of hot fat.
And bring me the head
of Alfredo Garcia.
Dr. Holmes was
surprised you fainted.
He was surprised?
I thought that body
was my dead brother.
Oh!
That spleen was
the spitting image.
No, I'm fine.
Nurse, I'm hyperventilating.
Would you get me
a paper bag?
- Yes, right away.
- Thank you.
Here you are, Doctor.
Oh, thank you.
Can I help you?
No. Uh, yes, there is,
actually.
One of my associates
was doing a biopsy on this man.
They said he had a melanoma,
carcinoma... some kind of noma.
There's no record
of it here.
If he had one,
it would be in here.
Wait. Here it is.
Surgical removal
of two moles.
Tissue was benign."
Benign? There's no mention
of cancer? Thaùs it?
Thaùs it.
This is one month ago.
According to this hospital,
Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
I guess not.
He'll be so relieved.
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.
Have a nice day.
I'm not finished.
- Sorry, Mr. Underhill.
- Do I look finished?
I guess not.
- Now I'm finished.
- Whatever you say.
You're expecting
a nice gratuity, right?
Maybe next time.
Gail Stanwyk?
Yeah.
I haven't seen you
since the wedding. You look great.
I do?
Thaùs sweet of you.
I musùve been plowed
at your wedding.
I don't know you.
Not my wedding,
your wedding.
Oh, my wedding.
Thank God.
Doesn't really help me.
Are you a friend of Alan's?
Yes, we flew together.
I'm John.
Oh, John.
Oh, yes.
No. John who?
John Cocktoasttoy.
Beautiful name.
Iùs Scotch-Rumanian.
- An odd combination.
- So were my parents.
Do you mind if I
practice some more?
Go ahead.
You're a member
of the club, seÒor?
No. I'm with the Underhills.
They left, seÒor.
He'll be back
after his urinalysis.
Would you like some drinks?
I'll put it on
the Underhills' bill.
Yes. I'll have
a Bloody Mary...
a steak sandwich,
and a steak sandwich.
So how's Alan?
He's been so busy lately,
I hardly see him.
- He's been preoccupied.
- With what?
I don't know.
Personal stuff.
Whoa!
I hit one.
Lobs are important
in tennis.
Sorry, sir.
I'll show you
a couple things.
Stand here.
When the ball comes,
face it like this.
Yeah.
And then
pivot your body,
step in
with your left foot.
Just like this.
OK?
Go ahead. Try one.
All right.
Go ahead.
Get in position.
The ball's going to come.
Ready?
How many are
in the machine?
- A lot, I thought.
- Iùs finished.
Good.
Much better.
I must be having an off day.
I'm usually a fabulous player.
I affect women this way.
I bet you do.
I bumped into Alan
this morning.
You know what
I can't figure out?
Alan's in Utah.
I can't figure out what I was doing
in Utah this morning.
I'm very flattered,
but I'm also very married.
You're hitting
on me, aren't you?
How did you guess?
I'm such a heel.
Don't know what came over me.
If I had a nickel
for every one of Alan's flyboy
buddies who tried to pick me up...
I'd be rich.
You are rich.
See what I mean?
The vice president knew
I was opening the door...
but the Secret Service...
Whack!
And blood...
Washington.
Sugar, Mr. Poon?
No, never, never.
Thank you.
Well, now,
let me reiterate...
that this is not
a formal investigation.
If Alan Stanwyk isn't involved
in improprieties...
Alan Stanwyk is not involved
in any improprieties.
How can the S.E.C.
make such an accusation?
You know that,
and I know that...
but somebody's bucking
for a promotion.
Iùs probably that
pederast Hanrahan.
If I don't go back
with something...
you and your son-in-law
will be the scapegoats.
Unbelievable.
This is unbelievable.
They want to know
why he's in Utah.
Jesus H. Christ
on a Popsicle stick.
First of all...
Alan Stanwyk does not own
one single share of stock.
The $3 million
for the ranch in Provo...
was entirely provided
by my daughter...
who converted her personal,
non-corporate holdings.
So, if any
of your D.C. boys...
want to challenge that,
bring them on.
Otherwise, tell them
to get out of my face.
God, I admire you.
Well...
consider
this case closed.
It stopped bleeding.
Isn't that something?
My pleasure.
Thank you and good day.
By the way...
what kind
of a name is Poon?
Comanche Indian.
Good-bye.
Madeline, Frieda lost the number
for Alan's realtor in Provo, Utah.
Could you get me that?
- Jim Swarthout?
- Yeah.
- Who are you again?
- I'm Frieda's boss.
- Who's Frieda?
- My secretary.
I knew my junkie pals were awaiting
my good cheer on the beach...
but I needed a second wind,
a beer and a wardrobe change.
As I pulled up to
my imitation apartment building...
I observed the Oldsmobuick
of Mr. Arnold T. Pants, Esquire...
attorney for the former
Mrs. Erwin Fletcher.
Time to use
the service entrance.
Refusal to pay alimony
is a jailable offense, Fletch.
What about trespassing
and loitering?
I am neither loitering
nor trespassing.
I've simply chosen
an advisable location...
to await my clienùs
delinquent husband.
I prefer to discuss
business inside.
Leave your rubbers outside.
A little one-on-one?
He draws the foul.
You owe Wendy $918.
She doesn't need it. She's been
living with somebody for months.
I don't
what you're referring to.
Wendy maintains
her own residence.
This stinks.
I empathize, Fletch.
However, you threw her out.
She slept with everybody.
Prove that in court.
My lawyer was a bum.
I agree.
They slept together.
You may be right.
Are you serious?
Thaùs history, Fletch.
You owe us $918.
Hey!
I think our problems may just
be solved. Ed McMahon.
I think I
just won $1 million.
Erwin M. Fletcher,
you choose.
Whoo-ee! I lost. Sorry.
Iùs no joke, Fletch.
If some kind of payment isn't made,
I'll have to garnish your wages.
I can't have
my wages garnish-ied.
Tell you what.
Cash? I'm impressed.
I saw my pimp today.
Open your raincoat.
Come on. Just once.
Iùs worth it.
Thaùs $1,000.
Apply some towards next month.
- Now scram.
- Till then.
Keep 10 and get yourself
a nice piece of ass.
Our guest is
the most valuable player...
of the National
Basketball Association...
from the Los Angeles Lakers...
the all-time scoring champion
of the N.B.A., Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
He's coming off a game that was
second to none in his brilliant career.
You must be proud.
Definitely, Chick.
It was a great effort.
But I had a lot of help,
and we're just glad to be here.
How about Fletch?
What can I say about Fletch?
He's been fantastic.
He boxes out for us,
gets the tough rebounds...
and does what
we need to win.
Iùs great working with him. I don't
know where we'd be without him.
Leùs look at the play.
He's 6'5. With the Afro, 6'9.
Good dribbler. Comes in deep.
His club is behind by one point.
Fletch puts the ball through the legs.
What a great play!
He puts it in!
The Lakers have the lead!
Was that some play! This kid
from Harlem really creates excitement.
$4 million a year,
but he earns every nickel.
Look how he shakes off
four or five defenders with ease.
Fletch... he truly defines
grace under pressure.
See if you've got anything on Stanwyk
from when he lived in Utah.
Yeah. And check out a realtor
in Provo named Swarthout.
Shit!
Whaùs going on?
Take off, Fletch!
What are you doing?
They're after
Gummy again.
Slow down.
This is dumb.
Come on, man!
He's defenseless.
Don't...
Get up!
What are you doing?
Fletch!
Let me out!
Beat it, cop!
Hey, you're really nuts.
You OK?
Yeah. I feel like $100.
- They didn't do anything.
- What are you talking about?
I busted their window.
You're lucky.
Iùs not luck.
They didn't want me.
They wanted Gummy.
The cops and Gummy...
Relax, Frank.
I need more time.
I could be onto something.
What?
I don't want to spoil your surprise.
Read about it tomorrow.
What do you want?
Don't point. Speak!
- I need Fletch.
- She needs me.
Nothing on Utah
or Jim Swarthout.
I know. Put this
on the back burner.
Right here. Thaùs good.
You wanna give me
just a little hint?
All right, Frank.
- There may be cops involved.
- Did you say cops?
- Yeah.
- Thaùs one thing I found.
- Iùs from last month.
- Whaùs this?
More cops. Frank,
I need to go to Utah.
Utah?
Yeah, Utah. Iùs wedged in
between Wyoming and Nevada.
- What about finding the source?
- I have some ideas.
Say yes, Frank. I'll buy you
some new deodorant.
Go to Transportation.
Get a ticket.
- My hero.
- Nothing to it.
You're not recording this,
are you?
No. Never. Never.
Question.
Question.
Why does a man
ask me to kill him...
and lie about dying
when he isn't dying?
Gail Stanwyk converts
$3 million of her stocks...
to buy the ranch.
Why pay in cash?
Mr. Jim Swarthout?
I'm lgor Stravinsky. I'm calling about
some ranch property I'd like to buy.
What did you have in mind?
Mm-hmm.
Are you a friend of Alan's?
No, not exactly.
I overheard some people
talking at the club.
$3 million sounded
like a good price.
Oh, is that right?
In that case,
I have been very misinformed.
Excuse you? Yes.
I'd like to come out and
see you anyway. Is that all right?
Whaùs good for you?
Well, I'm about
to close up shop.
How about tomorrow morning?
First thing in the morning.
Tomorrow. Bye.
Hello!
Anybody home?
Hey, fella, whaùs your name?
Fluff? Fifi?
All right.
Bad dog.
Sit.
Stay.
I hate dogs.
Come on. Smile.
Say, Fletch.
Look, defenseless babies.
Fell for the oldest trick
in the book.
# Strangers in the night #
# Exchanging clothing #
# Strangers in my pants... ##
Surprise!
- What the hell's...
- Police. Spread 'em!
- Got a gun?
- Shamu's got one. Borrow his.
- What have we here?
- Thaùs my dick.
Oh, funny boy.
What have we here?
Looks like heroin, Gene.
You just planted that.
- Whaùd you say?
- Wanna read me my rights?
You have the right
to remain silent.
You have the right
to have your face kicked in.
Nice.
You have the right to have
your balls stomped by him.
I'll waive my rights.
Whaùs the booking, gentlemen?
Possession of narcotics.
The chief wants to talk to him.
You'll like Chief Karlin.
He's a nice man.
I hear he's mellowed
since he came out of the closet.
Take his picture
while he still has a face.
That hurts.
You've been hurting.
Give him a buzz.
Come in.
Here he is, Chief.
Easy, fellas. I'll be
with you in a moment.
Did Mrs. Chief of Police
help you decorate?
So... whaùs your name?
Fletch.
- Full name.
- Fletch. F. Fletch.
I see. What do you do
for a living, Mr. Fletch?
I'm a shepherd.
Officers, could you excuse us
for a few moments?
Go to the gym
and pump each other.
Why are you doing this?
I like men.
I like to be manhandled.
I like you.
For someone caught holding
a bag of heroin...
- That was planted.
- We're looking at maybe 10 years.
Is that what you want, Jane Doe?
Your editor phoned me...
to respond to allegations
you're about to print...
concerning police involvement
in narcotics dealings.
Uh-uh. I'm about to bust
that beach wide open.
I don't need some penny-ante
Woodward and Bernstein...
to get in the way
of my men.
Your men may be involved in this.
I would think that might interest you.
Idiot!
All right.
Strictly off the record, OK?
Yeah, OK.
I got that beach crawling
with undercover cops.
But if you go nosing around,
you'll make the bad guys more cautious.
Makes my job harder.
And listen, if you print
your story this week...
it might get
some of my men killed.
I can't have that,
Mr. Fletch.
You understand?
Yeah.
I understand.
I got a deadline.
The name's Karlin
with a K?
You dipshit!
Go back to that beach,
you won't live to regret it!
All right?
Hey, you and
Tommy Lasorda.
- Yeah.
- I hate Tommy Lasorda.
Hey!
I'll take care of it now.
# Swing low,
sweet chariot #
I'll handle it from here.
# Comin' for
to carry me home ##
Can't keep me here.
Maybe I won't keep you.
Maybe I'll blow
your brains out.
I do believe thaùs
a violation of my rights.
After I shoot you,
I stick myself with this knife...
and place it
in your dead hand.
Self-defense.
We don't do it anymore,
but back in the old days...
You're serious.
Ask anybody.
Can I ask anybody now?
Can I call my mom,
tell her I love her.
Uh... guess not.
I'm a newspaper reporter. You don't
blow away newspaper reporters.
Kinda stupid, isn't it?
What will it be, Fletch?
Hey, I hate the beach anyway.
Iùs not even my story.
I've got a deadline
on the off-track betting...
in the Himalayas.
Smaller story, but I know
you've been following it.
You have things
under control down there.
Your beach.
Come on out.
Come on.
May I? Thank you.
How could you call him?
Fletch, I'm sorry.
You know how close
to death I came?
Yeah, iùs awful.
He had a gun at my head
and a knife in his hand!
He threatened
to kill me.
Hey, thaùs a shame.
He woulÔve shot me.
Unbelievable.
You don't believe me.
Nope.
- He thinks I'm lying.
- Unbelievable.
I need an article
by tomorrow.
- You believe me.
- Yes, I do.
I don't want unsubstantiated charges
about dope-dealing cops...
or paranoid fantasies
about homicidal police chiefs.
Give me something
I can print!
Print this.
Me, too.
Hey, watch it.
You're on thin ice, Larry.
It was time to hang out
at Boyd Aviation...
to find out what Stanwyk
was doing with that plane.
I splurged.
I invested 49 cents
on some novelty teeth.
Hey!
- You the guy from Ajax?
- Yeah, you bet.
All right.
- Thought you were bringing the eight?
- They're coming.
I'm the supervisor.
I don't carry the stuff.
Freddie's bringing them?
Yeah. Freddie.
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago.
Traffic was murder.
A manure spreader
jackknifed on the Santa Ana.
God-awful mess.
You should see my shoes.
Whew!
Stanwyk's baby, huh?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Looks well-used.
Travels to Utah every weekend.
Is that right?
Is he a Mormon?
I don't think he's doing
a lot of singing...
with the Tabernacle Choir.
These executives live high.
Know what I mean?
I sure do.
Thaùs a terrific wing.
I love this shape.
Do us a favor, pal.
Name's Liddy.
Gordon Liddy.
Take a look
at the seventh Fetzer valve.
Iùs been sticking.
Probably the humidity.
Thaùs funny.
I think iùs
the by-pass line.
It could be the by-pass line.
I should look at it.
Uh, Gordo?
Back here?
Don't tell me
my business, boy!
Just checking the luggage.
Somebody should clean these windows.
There's gook all over 'em.
Look at that.
You use a lot of fuel
to go to Utah?
I ask that, too.
Burns enough to go
to South America and back.
South America and back.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
I always kid him.
I say:
You doing some stunt flying
up there or something?
Whaùs he say?
Nothing.
He just gives me that look.
You know,
he's got that look.
Yeah, he just gives him
that look.
Sure.
He's the boss.
Let me look
at this Fetzer.
Uh, Gord.
I know. I'm getting
a birÔs-eye view.
Oh, ho ho.
Iùs the by-pass line, right?
I think so. Yeah.
Told ya.
I'll need some pliers...
and a set of 30-weight
ball bearings.
- What?
- Yeah.
Tell ya what.
I gotta go to my truck.
If Fred gets here before I'm back,
tell him to start without me.
Why do you need
ball bearings?
Come on, guys.
Maybe you need
a refresher course.
Hey, iùs all
ball bearings nowadays.
Prepare that valve
with 3-in-1 oil...
and gauze pads.
And I'll need 10 quarts
of antifreeze...
preferably Prestone.
No, make that
Quaker State.
And wash those windows.
They got muck on 'em.
Buenos dÌas, seÒor.
Hi. Where's
Mrs. Stanwyk?
In her cabana.
I'm supposed to meet her.
Cabana six?
Cabana one. You would like
something to eat or drink?
Actually, I would.
Charge it
to the Underhills?
Right.
Do you have any caviar?
SÌ, seÒor. Beluga.
But it is $80 a portion.
I better just take
two portions.
How's the Lobster Thermidor?
- I recommend it.
- Good. Thaùll be fine.
Bring two bottles
of Dom Perignon.
Very good, seÒor.
- Put down $30 for yourself.
- Muchas gracias, seÒor.
Who is it?
Iùs John.
John who?
Iùs John.
John Levin... I don't remember.
John Cocktoastin?
Hi.
Hi.
I was hoping
you'd say that.
I just got out of the shower.
Yeah.
Can I borrow your towel?
My car hit
a water buffalo.
Nice place.
I'm surprised to see you.
What are you doing here?
I ordered some lunch.
For here?
I knew this is where
my mouth would be.
I really should change.
No, you should stay
the wonderful person you are today.
I mean put clothes on.
Make yourself comfortable.
Are you always
this forward?
Only with
wet married women.
Get the door!
Ah. Very good, gentlemen.
Come right in.
Right in this way.
Right in here.
Thaùs good.
Thaùs very nice.
Want I set up?
No, I'll take care of it.
Give each other $20.
- Put it on Underhill.
- Muchas gracias.
Sierra del fuego.
Oh, this is beautiful.
There we have it.
This goes
on the Underhills' bill?
I saved his life
during the war.
- You were in the war?
- No, he was. I got him out.
Oh.
I can't believe
I'm doing this.
This is great.
Leùs eat.
- Your bill, seÒor.
- Oh, thank you.
- $400 for lunch?
- Your guest, seÒor.
We didn't have
any guests today.
Two bottles of Dom Perignon?
$100 a pop!
- Jesus H. Christ! Where is he?
- With Ms. Stanwyk.
- Where's she?
- Cabana one.
Can I ask you a question?
- Depends on the question.
- More champagne?
- Yes.
- Are you still in love with Alan?
No. I mean, no, you can't
ask me that question.
- Ask me another one.
- Why'd you let me in?
Um, because I'm bored.
If you're bored, why didn't you
go to Utah with Alan?
Utah's not exactly
a cure for boredom.
Good point.
I've never been there.
I shouldn't say that.
What about his parents?
He hasn't seen them for years.
I've never met them.
They don't get along?
- Mrs. Stanwyk.
- Yes?
I'm sorry to disturb you.
Iùs Ted Underhill.
Thanks for a great time.
l... Whew! ...gotta go.
Wait a minute.
What is this?
Someone of
your acquaintance...
has charged a $400 lunch
to my account.
You don't know
the Underhills?
I'd like to discuss this matter
with you.
I'm just out of the shower.
- Wait a minute.
- I have to wee-wee.
Yes, of course.
- Why did you do it?
- You shouldn't have to pay the bill.
A $400 lunch tab?
Iùs outrageous.
Iùs way over the line.
I'll cover it. You can't
go out looking like that.
He might spot you.
Hold on.
You look like you're the same size
as Alan. Put this on.
- Nice suit.
- Just return it.
Any other surprises?
Yeah.
My name is not
John Cocktoastin.
- I wasn't at your wedding.
- Who are you?
I'm Erwin Fletcher.
I write a newspaper column
under the name of Jane Doe.
So?
So...
your husband
hired me to kill him.
-
- Mrs. Stanwyk.
- Mrs. Stanwyk!
- In a minute!
Enough surprises.
What are you talking about?
Sit down.
Your husband told me he was dying
of cancer. Is that true?
Iùs not true.
That property you thought
you were buying in Utah? Not true.
He's a bad guy.
He's involved in something
very big and very bad.
Do you know Jim Swarthout?
Yeah. He's the man
who sold us the ranch.
Wrong. He sold you
$3,000 worth of scrub brush.
I saw the deed.
You saw a forgery.
This is the real deed.
There's Swarthouùs name.
If this were legible,
you'd see what I meant.
This dog tried to bite me.
The motel, my car.
The Mormon Tabernacle.
Stop it. Stop.
He's told me a lot of things.
So far, not one has been true.
I'm sorry to have to
tell you these things.
- Mrs. Stanwyk!
- Just wait a minute!
- I'll call my father. He'll know.
- No, you can't.
I know you don't know me,
but you've gotta trust me.
Give me 24 hours.
Mrs. Stanwyk!
You a Laker fan?
No.
- Just a minute!
- I'll take you to a game.
Mrs. Stanwyk!
Sorry. Thanks. Bye.
- What are you talking about?
- I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
- If you need me, call the paper.
- What do I do for 24 hours?
- Act natural.
- I was afraid you'd say that.
Oh, Jesus. Whaùs he
doing with the chief?
Seeing Bone Cancer
and Chief Karlin together...
might lead
to a page one item.
but without real evidence,
Frank wouldn't print it.
I had to keep digging...
without a shovel.
Smog Patrol.
Had your emissions checked?
- No, sir.
- Fluorocarbons? Ozone?
- No, sir.
- Well, leùs check it out.
What do you say?
Smells pretty good.
Thaùs him.
Unit 12, in pursuit.
Catch some shuteye.
Lay back and enjoy.
- Try to breathe through your nose.
- Aaah!
I use chewing gum on these rides.
It filters out the pollutants.
Aw, shit!
You've got good grillwork.
Keep out the ozone.
I gotta get this thing up to 95,
check out the fluorocarbon output.
Don't worry about the speed limit.
Thaùs why we've got the police escort.
- You a cop?
- As far as you know.
You gonna take me to jail
for car theft?
- Why, did you steal the car?
- I sure did!
I'm not even sure
thaùs a crime anymore.
Pull over!
Hey, look out
for that truck!
Just a game I play with my buddies.
Hide-and-seek kind of thing.
They love it.
What a day!
Must be a stage two.
Do a little slip-streaming.
Whoa! There's Fred!
Won't he be surprised!
Don't you hear me?
I said pull over...
Uh-oh.
Got a license?
Not on me.
You have one?
- No.
- Pull over, buddy!
- Hey, Freddie, how's the herpes?
- Pull over!
- I did before. I'll pull over later.
- Pull over!
Thaùs it.
Turn your bike in!
- You're a disgrace to the force!
-  Aaah!
Get the door!
Congratulations.
You passed the test.
Raise your left hand.
My men will be right with you.
Thelma Noble, Ellis Lee Hereford...
Lee Weaver...
and Harold Arthur.
I would like for you to meet
our friends on the dais.
- Hold your applause until I'm finished.
- More coffee?
- Kitty Domaine, Selby Desner.
- There you go.
Barbara Wattell,
Walter Smith...
Martha Sterling
and Paul Fleming.
And to my right,
Michael Kenyon...
Olivia D. Williams...
Otto Bailey...
Bea Dorfman.
And now...
the Father of
Internal Bushings...
our very own
and beloved leader...
A man who needs
no introduction!
Thank you very much, Sammy.
I couldn't wait.
That was a very nice introduction,
and I am...
very thrilled
and proud to be here.
Iùs been a wonderful ceremony
here on behalf of our own Fred...
The Dorf Dorfman!
- Who is he?
- Fred was darn near death recently.
He wasn't ashamed to admit to me
that he had syphilis.
Thank God he stopped it
in its tracks.
It takes a lot for a man...
to admit where he got it from
and how he got it.
Look at him today.
Fred, you look just wonderful.
The nose looks normal again.
The face has come back into shape.
Iùs not drooling anymore.
And hats off to Marge, his wife,
because that whole experience...
the three weeks that she stayed
at Trembling Hills has paid off.
No more alcohol
or sedatives in her life.
There are many other things
I wanna tell you about Fred...
things that maybe many of you
already know.
Sammy, you're not going
to sing for us, are you?
Did you know that Fred
spent much of his life...
honoring a profession that has gone
largely unsung around here?
Some of them are here tonight.
The profession is law enforcement.
I know Fred feels that too often
our feelings are locked in...
and we feel restrained
and perhaps even embarrassed...
to reach out and touch
an officer of the law.
After all, they are people,
aren't they?
Stand up. Pat them on the back.
Reach out.
Shake hands with any one
of these men in blue.
Hug a cop!
Yeah, go ahead. I said it.
Yeah!
Thaùs a wonderful feeling!
I'm so proud tonight!
# Oh, say can you see #
# By the dawn's
early light #
# What so proudly we hail #
# At the twilighùs
last gleaming ##
Hip, hip, hooray!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Mr. Stanwyk,
you are confirmed on Flight 441...
to Rio de Janeiro tomorrow evening,
Thaùs terrific.
Thank you.
- You reconfirmed this morning.
- You bet I did.
I'm a bear for detail.
I hope there's nobody
sitting next to me.
I always travel first class,
and I take both seats up.
I'm in bridge work.
Bridge construction.
These fold-outs
take a lot of space.
There is someone
next to you.
Oh, for God don don!
Who is it? Mr. Singleton?
- No. The name is Cavanaugh.
- Cavanaugh?
Ah! Morris or Pierre?
Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Sally Ann?
Well, terrific.
In fact, you purchased
the ticket for Miss Cavanaugh.
Doesn't mean I want her
sitting next to me.
The flighùs full.
She's connecting out of Provo.
Oh. All right, fine.
Provo, Spain?
Utah.
Utah.
Frank, don't give me crap
about the beach story.
- I'm at the airport.
-  The airport?
There are two dozen cops
after my ass.
I can't go home or to the office.
I'm a man without a country.
If cops are really after you,
come in here. You'll be OK.
I couldn't
get through the front door.
I'm going to Utah.
You go to Utah,
you stay in Utah.
I'm turning the story over
to a professional reporter.
The story is Utah.
Trust me.
You're going to Utah?
Fine.
If you're story is not on my desk
by 11:30, you're fired.
Cujo?
Who the hell are you?
Get up!
I'm up.
- Door was unlocked.
- Lock's busted.
There you have it.
I work for the landlord.
He told me to watch out
for the place.
- I commend him on his choice.
- What?
I commend him
on his choice.
I was supposed to meet
Mrs. Cavanaugh here.
Who are you?
I'm Don Corleone,
Mrs. Cavanaugh's cousin.
You know where she is?
Moved out.
Moved out?
Isn't that something.
I talked to her last week.
She didn't say a thing about it.
- She moved out.
- You're saying she moved out.
- This morning.
- This morning?
God! Uh. We had
so much to talk about.
Mo Green is out
of the Tropicana.
My sons, Mike and Fredo,
are taking over.
What did you
want under the bed?
I have to pull rank on you.
I didn't want to have to do this.
I'm with the mattress police.
There are no tags on these mattresses.
I'm taking you downtown.
Give me the weapon.
I'm calling the cops.
- This is for the cops.
- Come on, man. I'm her cousin.
Tell the cops.
OK. You wanna call the cops,
call the cops.
Better tie
your shoelaces first.
Thanks a lot!
Stretch, whaùs happening?
- Got an unbelievable story here.
- Yeah? Great.
- What can I do?
- Write this down. Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Check every hotel in L.A.
Start near the airport.
He's supposed to leave the country
with her tomorrow night.
Got that, honey?
I love your body, Larry.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
They should
recall these things.
Hit one bump
and the window explodes.
You're Marvin Stanwyk?
- Yeah.
- Hi there.
Harry S. Truman,
Casewell Insurance underwriters.
Harry S. Truman?
My parents were fans
of the former president.
Isn't that nice.
He was a good man.
- He sure was.
- He showed the Japs a thing or two.
- Dropped the big one, huh?
- He dropped two big ones on them.
- He was a real fighter.
- Yeah.
You're in insurance, Harry?
Thaùs right.
- Well, I'm fully covered.
- I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk.
Actually, my company
sub-insures a policy...
held by Alan Stanwyk,
who I believe is your son.
Yeah, he is.
Mr. Truman,
meet my wife Velma.
- My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.
Sit down and have
a glass of lemonade.
- Thank you.
- Velma makes the most unusual lemonade.
Iùs hard to keep it cold
on a day like this.
Where you from, Harry?
I'm from California.
San Berdoo.
Yeah. Utah is
part of my route.
You folks don't mind if I ask you
a couple of questions, do you?
- Shoot.
- Thank you very much.
We'll start with
some routine things.
You and your wife
are currently alive, I take it?
- Harry, if there's...
- Iùs just regulations.
Now, you, Marvin,
and your wife named Velma...
are the parents of one Alan Stanwyk
of Beverly Hills...
Executive Vice President
of Boyd Aviation.
-  Check.
- Check.
And when did you last see Alan?
Oh... uh...
about 10 days ago.
He comes and visits
about every three weeks.
Isn't that nice.
How long has he done that?
Since he moved to L.A.
Pardon me if I seem a bit personal here.
I don't know how to put it.
We understand that there's
a young lady friend in Provo...
that Alan's been seeing.
Whaùs this got to do
with insurance?
This is a comprehensive policy.
Forget about
that lady friend business.
Alan is
a loving husband.
He dotes on his bride.
Who?
His wife.
You've met her?
Of course we have.
He brings her with him.
Has Alan ever mentioned
the name Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Has he?
Boy, what in the hell's
the matter with you?
- He has.
- Of course he has.
Thaùs his wife.
Of course.
His wife's name
is Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Cute as a button.
You wouldn't have
a picture of them, would you?
We've got lots of pictures.
- Let me get you some.
- Great.
Still married are they,
Alan and Sally Ann?
Yes, they are.
How long have
they been married?
It was before
he moved to L.A.
Eight years April.
This gets heavier
each year.
There we are.
Here it is.
- Thaùs the one.
- Oh, my goodness.
She is a button,
isn't she?
Isn't she cute?
Could I borrow this picture?
I promise to send it back.
- Iùs routine. The actuarial people...
- Thaùs all right. We have more.
- Want to see the reception?
- No, thank you. I'm trying to quit.
How about Marvin's
- How about that, Marvin?
- They got a picture of me in here.
This is Alan?
I can't believe this!
Iùs really Alan,
and iùs really bigamy.
- How long have they been married?
- About eight years.
Who is this woman?
I think iùs Alan's
high school sweetheart.
Sally Ann something or other.
Alan's been keeping
many secrets lately.
I'm calling the police.
No, Gail, don't.
- I'm calling my father.
- Give me one more day.
Why? Do you have any idea
how humiliating this is?
Yes, I do.
I really do.
Remember what I told you?
Tomorrow night you have a club meeting.
Stay away from the house.
I'll take care of him.
- Don't worry.
- She looks like a hooker.
Look at her. Could you love
someone who looked like that?
What are you talking about?
Of course not.
maybe.
Iùs funny.
I know. Listen.
Why don't we relax and lie down
and I'll fill you in.
This is a good time
to make a pass at me.
- Gum?
- Who? Go somewhere else.
Gum, iùs me.
- Fletch. Really, is that you?
- Shut up. Don't say my name.
Shut up. Don't look at me.
I gotta talk to you.
All right. About what?
There are cops all around here.
They're after me.
- You mean those surfers over there?
- Lay back down.
- Don't point. Just lay back.
- OK.
- Why they after you?
- I'm a newspaper reporter.
I'm nailing Chief Karlin as
the major drug source on this beach.
Sit back.
Fat Sam's turning
State's evidence.
Whaùs that?
He wrote me
a nice deposition.
Said he received the drugs
and you did the selling.
He said what?
Fletch, he's lying.
I didn't sell nothing.
You gotta believe me.
I just carried the drugs
from the chief to Sam.
- Sure you did, Gum.
- Honest, man. Thaùs all I did.
Unless you want to play ball.
You don't leave me
much choice.
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
These robes...
I got another question.
Where does the chief
get his drugs?
I don't know.
Have fun.
Don't bend over for the soap.
Fletch.
Fletch, OK.
Iùs somewhere
in South America.
Mind if I sit here?
Fletch?
Man...
- You don't know me, Sam.
- My pleasure, brother.
I'm a reporter, Sam.
I'm breaking the story
on the drug traffic around here.
Gummy's turning
State's evidence.
I got good proof
iùs the chief.
You gonna bust the chief?
Gonna bust the chief.
I could use your help.
I'm a slave to that
son of a bitch.
He busted me,
third offense.
Said push for him or do 15 long.
All I get from this is free junk.
- You don't have a piece of the action?
- No. Free junk, thaùs it.
Hey, how you doing?
Albert Einstein's forehead.
You like it? Won it in a raffle.
Fellas, stay with me.
Fletch?
Whaùs up?
- I'm quitting at midnight.
- Who are they?
This is Fat Sam and Gummy.
Come with me.
Their statements
name Chief Karlin...
as the number one drug pusher
from here to Oxnard.
I want them to have Federal protection
sponsored by the paper. OK?
- This is wonderful.
- I'm out, Frank.
- You lost faith in me.
- Fletch, I got nervous.
Forget it.
I'm writing the story.
Hold the last two paragraphs
till 10:00.
You want an apology?
- You were going to can me, right?
- No, not really.
- Not really?
- I was upset. You know.
OK. Jesus,
I'm sick of this place.
Ow.
I'll try out for the Lakers.
They need a power forward.
This is a hell of a story.
Thanks.
- About these guys...
- They're fine.
You don't have valuables
in there, do you?
Good evening.
I like your outfit.
Did you bring the 50 grand
and the tickets?
Of course.
Oh, oh, oh. You forgot
your rubber gloves.
You're planning
on killing me, aren't you?
You catch on real quick,
Mr. Nugent.
Thaùs a hostile thing to do.
You were gonna kill me.
I look at this as self-defense.
Now, if you would be so kind
as to put your passport on my desk.
You're wearing my suit.
Where did you get that?
Where did you get my suit,
Mr. Nugent?
The name's Fletcher.
I'm a newspaper reporter.
I write a column
under the name Jane Doe.
- What is this?
- Read this.
- I don't have time...
- Cut the crap.
Come read this.
I'm not going anywhere.
Unless my people hear differently,
that letter goes out at midnight.
Dear Mr. Boyd:
Alan Stanwyk
murdered me tonight.
Charred remains found in the Jaguar
are mine, not his.
Mr. Stanwyk,
using my name and passport...
boarded Pan Am Flight 306.
- On arrival, he intends..."
- Pretty hefty.
Keep reading.
...with his legal wife...
the former
Sally Ann Cavanaugh..."
Don't stop, Alan.
- Uh-oh. The missus.
- What are you doing here?
I know most of it. I want
to hear the rest from you.
He doesn't read my stuff very well.
Let me take a crack at it.
Sally Ann and Alan
were married eight years ago...
never divorced, making Stanwyk
a bigamist, even in Utah.
Stanwyk is traveling
with $3 million in cash...
the result of Gail Stanwyk's
conversion of Boyd Aviation stock."
Iùs true, isn't it?
Sally Ann
can confirm this...
when the police pick her up
at the Airport Marriott."
Isn't that where she is?
By the way,
Alan is a big drug smuggler.
But you can read about that
in tomorrow's paper.
Sincerely, I.M. Fletcher.
P.S. Have a nice day."
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
Bravo.
What tipped me was something your wife
said while we were in bed together.
Oh?
And what was that?
She said we had roughly
the same build.
From the waist up,
I imagine.
Then I figured it.
You bump me off,
plop me in the car...
and burn me up.
What the heck,
same bone structure.
You son of a bitch.
But I'm not a stupid
son of a bitch.
I was prepared to commit
one murder, assface.
What makes you think
I won't commit two?
- Whoops.
- What do you mean, Whoops?
By the time your story's published,
I'll be on the beach.
I understand extradition
from South America's complicated.
For two murders,
iùs even more so.
That thing loaded?
If you shoot me...
you're liable to lose
those humanitarian awards.
Tough shit, Hopalong.
Greetings, everyone.
Thank God, the police.
What are you doing here?
Put the gun down.
I can take care of them.
Thought you had this figured out.
Nice going, Erwin.
Don't ever
call me Erwin.
Fat Sam and Gummy
left the beach today.
It occurred to me that maybe there are
things happening I should be aware of.
I'll take care of this.
It doesn't involve you. Go home.
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- What? Long distance?
Overheard you say something
about South American extradition.
Are you taking that $800,000
I staked you with on the next load?
You two have a lot
to talk over.
We'll just catch the last
ten minutes of Dynasty.
Jerry,
you're gonna have to trust me!
I got a way to get rid of this asshole,
and you're jeopardizing everything!
Your way is gonna land my butt
on the front page...
while you're basking
in the sun!
With your money.
The second one's
going to be more fun.
Go ahead, make my day.
Thanks.
No, this is getting absurd.

- Iùs business. I hate tennis.
- Whaùs novelty teeth?
Frank, iùs all business.
A nun's habit.
Six tubes of Crazy Glue.
Thaùs personal.
- Take it out of my raise.
- You're not getting a raise. Come on.
I would think the D.A. would need
these tickets for evidence.
Not necessarily.
- Not necessarily?
- Larry!
In the court ruling
U.S. vs. Fishbein...
a man subjected to
potential incineration...
while wearing
another man's suit...
is entitled to $10,000 worth
of airline tickets.
Iùs an obscure ruling
but very important one to me.
Why don't you say that you want
to take me to Rio with you?
There's a different slant.
The thing is, we haven't
really dated formally.
I take first dates
to Laker games.
I don't want to go
to a Laker game.
I don't like basketball.
Maybe thaùs because
you don't understand basketball.
You haven't learned the fundamentals.
The pick and roll.
Sounds like a fast-food chain.
- Reverse stuff.
- That I've done.
I'll bet you have,
you little vixen.
The coroner

I decided
to accompany Gail to Rio...
and personally assist her
in her grief therapy.
On the beach, I explained basketball
to her, but she didn't grasp it.
- Fletch?
- Call me Erwin.
Why do they bounce
the ball the whole time?
Doesn't it seem
a little childish?
Well, it may seem that,
but thaùs called dribbling.
- Dribbling?
- If they stop bouncing the ball...
they get called for traveling.
Traveling. Aha.
Thaùs what they call it
when you don't bounce the ball.
When it came to basketball,
Gail was a loss.
But we had our own version
of one-on-one...
and she thought I was the bravest man
in the world, which I am.
By the way, I charged the vacation to
Mr. Underhill's American Express card.
