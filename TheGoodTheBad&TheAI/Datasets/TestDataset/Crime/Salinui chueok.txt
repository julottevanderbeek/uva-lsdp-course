Junk car!
Get out of here, kid.
I told you to get out of here.
Go home, kid.
Go home, kid.
Little brat.
Little brat.
What the hell are they doing?
What the hell are they doing?
Hey you!
Hey you!
Put that back!
Put that back!
Hey, leave it there. Go away.
Hey you!
Hey you!
That's important, don't touch!
That's important, don't touch!
Those kids.
Those kids.
MEMORIES OF MURDER
What?
You dated the dead girl, and
she dumped you last August?
Is that right?
That's correct.
That's correct? Take off
your hat, you damn punk.
Do women like guys like you?
After watching Body Heat...
Body Heat?
That an action movie?
A, c, t...
Damn punk...
...since it's a rape
and murder case and all...
well...
...if she was sexy,
or pretty, that sort of thing.
Your impressions?
Well,
she didn't seem
like a country girl...
Don't blink.
You blinked, didn't you?
Hey, look at me.
Don't look at the ceiling,
look at me!
Was he born that way?
One, two...
Didn't you want to go
to the Military Academy?
Did you take the exam?
You need to study hard
to get in there.
- Receipt!
- You didn't ask for one.
What? I told you to bring one.
- I told you.
- No you didn't.
That's what you said last time...
Here's one, here.
You answered the phone,
you lying bastard...
I need a receipt from the restaurant.
Not from a bicycle shop.
Directed by BONG Joon-Ho
Why didn't you rope
the place off?
At least get some sticks
to drive them in, morons.
Inspector Park, over here!
- What is this?
- It's a footprint.
- When did you find it?
- This morning, sir!
Go help those jerks over there.
You called the forensics team?
Yes, they're on their way.
But, where's the
person who reported this?
No forensics team,
this is total chaos!
Jesus, look at him!
Hey!
Get out of here!
Who received the call on this?
Did you find out
who reported it?
The phone... The crime
site is getting ruined.
Damn forensics team's
not here, this is a mess.
What are you talking about?
Take pictures when I tell you!
Why'd you bring
so many reporters?
They were all here when I arrived.
Reporter Park's not here.
Must be on vacation.
I don't see him.
Feels great with
that shithead gone.
Why does this have
to happen to me?
How can I investigate like this?
Hey, tractor!
Tractor!
Tractor, stay away! Detour!
If someone waves,
shouldn't you look?
Shit, is he deaf?
Shit! Look at this.
Now those bastards show up.
What the hell took you so long?
The crime scene's ruined!
Jesus, look at these sliding fools!
What's going on?
How can you look at
those photos while eating?
If I keep staring at them,
one moment it'll hit me.
Instinctively.
Are you a fortune teller?
Open up a shop then.
Chief, I may know nothing else,
but my eyes can read people.
It's how I survive as a detective.
There's a reason people
say I have shaman's eyes.
OK, then.
You see those two guys there?
One of them's a rapist, and the
other is the victim's brother.
He caught the guy doing this to
his sister, and dragged him in.
So tell me,
which one's the rapist?
- Hey.
- What?
I think it fell out.
Really?
Let's do this properly.
I'll give this to you
especially today.
I'm so grateful.
It's just a flu shot.
Know how much this costs?
- Kwak Sul-young?
- Yeah?
You must be earning more
now than at the hospital.
I hear everyone in
town comes to you.
Shh. I got something to tell you.
I heard this from the
old woman at the mill.
You know the Baek family
meat restaurant?
The Baek family?
You know what people call them?
What?
The Baek Lady Killers.
- Ladies?
- Yeah.
But the son's a little
bit retarded. Kwang-ho.
Kwang-ho used to follow
Hyang-sook around all the time.
Hyang-sook?
The one who was killed?
Yeah.
She was found with
a girdle over her head?
Right.
Even more important,
the night she was killed...
that old woman saw
Kwang-ho following her.
- Really?
- That's what I'm saying.
I heard that old hag
went senile last year.
No, she's fine.
That kid... Wait.
Kwang-ho? What's he look like?
This side of his face is a bit...
you know.
Tell me in detail.
Anyways, he's a poor little kid.
Kwang-ho.
Let's talk man to man.
You see a pretty girl,
you want to do her.
When I was your age, I'd go
out with friends, I understand.
You never intended to kill
Hyang-sook at first, huh?
"How about just
touching her breast..."
I couldn't touch it.
So you killed her?
Kill her, then you can touch it.
No, I didn't.
That guy coming down now,
he's had a hard life, like you.
He's nice.
He's really sweet.
He never beats anyone.
But sometimes,
you know,
if he gets worked up
about something...
God, what an ugly face.
Just looking at this face
makes me angry.
Shit.
Pretty?
This is so it won't
leave scratches, you punk.
Hey, hey...
What's with the army boots?
Doing this to the kid...
Kwang-ho, get up.
Are you really innocent? Huh?
Look in my eyes.
Where the hell's he looking?
Look in my eyes!
Excuse me, miss...
Hello?
Oh, miss?
Are you all right?
Why are you following me?
to ask directions.
Let me help you.
Let go!
What's wrong?
Rolling in the fields, huh?
Is this town rapist's paradise?
You shithead.
What the hell?
Who are you?
Get over here.
Hey miss, the victim
needs to file a report!
Miss!
Where is she going?
Are you a detective?
You should have told me.
My mistake.
How can a detective
be such a bad fighter?
How can a detective have
such a bad eye for criminals?
What's that smell?
Oh, sneakers.
They smell bad?
But these here are
evidence item 28.
Develop these quickly, huh?
- Uh, chief.
- What?
This guy here... from Seoul.
Nice to meet you!
I got the call...
But...
your face...
Did anything happen?
- No, nothing.
- A desk, you need...
Oh, I prepared a desk
over there with lots of sunlight.
I think... I like that corner.
Okay, okay! As you wish.
Inspector Jo, say hello.
From Seoul,
Suh Tae-... yoon, senior officer.
Jo Yong-gu. Nice to meet you.
He volunteered to assist
with this investigation.
Quite an uncommon thing.
Well, go arrange your desk.
Yes, sit down.
Inspector Chief
The song is great.
The opening song.
I always watch
lnspector Chief with Dad.
What was my phone number?
Just eat.
Right, I need to call Dad!
I should call. Oh, it's Dad!
Hey, Kwang-ho.
Listen.
This footprint was found at the
site of Hyang-sook's murder.
Look.
And these are sneakers
we found at your house.
You wear these? Right?
Now, look closely.
The footprint in this photo,
and the sole of your shoe.
The same, right?
This pattern?
The circle, this indentation?
Exactly the same.
Am I right?
This part was smudged,
don't worry about that.
You killed all
those women, right?
Okay.
You didn't kill them all, right?
So you didn't not kill only
Hyang-sook, correct?
I didn't kill anyone.
We've got the
evidence here!
- Where's our shovel?
- Shovel?
Look at you...
Hey, bastard. Give me that.
Can't you even shovel right?
Watch me.
Loosen the dirt first.
Then push with your foot.
- Kwang-ho!
- Yes?
You punk.
Did you come here to play?
You know where this is?
We came here to bury you.
What? Why?
Why?
Because you won't
listen, you bastard.
- I'm a good boy.
- Then tell me!
Out here in the fresh air.
With that face.
Hey, come here.
Women hate this
face, don't they?
They grimace and all
fucking run away.
It's true.
I'll kill them all.
Everyone who
grimaces at my face.
I'll kill them all.
Those women who grimace,
they're all in my head.
- Hyang-sook too?
- Hyang-sook?
Hyang-sook. You always
followed her around.
- Hyang-sook is pretty.
- Oh yeah, she's pretty.
But Hyang-sook
grimaced too, huh?
She said, "Fuck, get away!"
didn't she?
Because you liked her.
So you killed her, huh?
By the train tracks.
In that rice paddy.
The train tracks? Right.
Her throat. Hyang-sook's throat...
..strangled it tightly.
- With what?
- Her brassiere.
With her white brassiere,
strangled her tightly.
- And then?
- Her stocking.
- Her stocking?
- Pulled off her leg.
Then it was the stocking.
This guy's smart, huh?
And then?
What?
What was it?
Something with a strap?
A handbag strap?
Right, a bag strap.
Strangling Hyang-sook's
throat with it tightly.
And?
Then, Hyang-sook's
body shook a bit.
She looked completely dead.
And then?
Her head was covered up.
With what?
Her panties. Covered her
head with her panties.
Do you mean a girdle?
That women wear?
Right, girdle!
Looked like it covered
her head right up.
And then?
Um... had to dress her again.
And why was that?
I don't know.
Put the clothes back on.
Why was that?
How would I know?
You were doing well!
Bastard! What did you do next?
- Then... running!
- Where?
- It was raining!
- Where did you run?
- Kept running.
- Oh, you little shit!
The lightning struck!
Where the hell were you
running, you bastard!
Yong-gu, start digging.
Huh? Digging?
Lightning!
Citizens, this is a
civil defence drill.
The air raid siren
has begun to sound.
This is only a drill.
The entire country is now
under a civil defence drill.
A blackout is called for
in all buildings and houses.
Follow the instructions
you hear in this broadcast.
Please move all flammable
materials to a safe place.
Unplug all cords, then hurry
to an underground area...
Shut off the lights!
Hey, you!
Come here.
Put this on.
Everyone ready?
Get in the car.
Turn around.
"Lee Hyang-sook"
Take off your pants.
What'll the headline be?
"Crime-Fighting Trio" or
"Smiles of the Unstoppable."
Inspector Park, in the back.
Make a straight line now.
Miss Kwon, big party tonight!
Reserve a room.
Smile!
This time, hold up your fist.
Tight!
- Come take a picture!
- That's okay.
Come on!
Wait a second.
With these webbed fingers,
you can't even hold
chopsticks, right?
They've always been this way?
Go on.
Kwang-ho, this is the spot, right?
I don't know.
What's he talking about?
It was here.
For the re-enactment,
you have to act well.
There are a lot of reporters here.
How's this?
A bit lower.
- What do we start with?
- Wait.
It's best to write down
the correct order.
Then why didn't you do it?
I'm fucking busy.
Chief.
The re-enactment
isn't going to work anyway.
becomes an embarrassment.
Hey, I told you to stay away.
Why'd you come back here?
Just give them some excuse.
The suspect is sick, or...
Inspector Suh!
You're dumping shit
on cooked rice here!
I told you before,
Kwang-ho isn't guilty.
Just shut up!
Chief...
The cords around their necks
were tied with three tight knots.
Look at Kwang-ho's hands.
Could he do that?
- Get out!
- Even a child can see that.
Get the hell out!
Grab the brassiere strap...
Hey, concentrate!
Dad!
Kwang-ho! It's me!
Dad!
Hey, you're innocent!
I know! I didn't do it!
Mr. Baek Kwang-ho!
Are you denying a crime?
He didn't kill anyone!
My son's innocent!
You were tortured, weren't you?
My team never tortures suspects.
It's all gone to hell.
Don't bring it up.
Hey, did you see the look on
prosecutor Choi's face back there?
Fuck, how can he
revoke the warrant?
We even had evidence.
Evidence? That footprint?
How can they set him free?
What can we do?
All we had was a confession.
It was no ordinary confession.
You heard the tape.
All the details of the crime
came pouring out his mouth.
Things he'd never know
if he weren't the killer.
Like how she was strangled.
You heard it too.
Be honest, didn't you
rehearse that in advance?
What?
Quiet. Eat something.
Jesus...
What? I said to separate
the noodles and bean sauce.
What the fuck!
Investigative Team Reshuffled
Murder Case Shrouded
In Mystery Once Again
The location of
the first homicide,
and the second homicide.
Now, a distance of...
approximately 1000 meters.
A length of not more
than... one kilometer.
The victim, on the
both days at twelve o'clock...
Ah, December 16th.
On December 16th,
at twelve o'clock,
Location:Yangji Teahouse,
Han Sung-geun
a 32-year old office worker.
An arranged date, maybe?
Anyway, at the crime site
...were found a footprint,
two drops of blood,
...and a drop of semen.
Semen? They found semen?
What? Yes.
The two dead women...
Did they have
anything in common?
In common...
Well, first...
Both of them were single.
They were both
extremely beautiful.
And?
The murders all
took place in the rain.
Rain?
He murdered them
on rainy nights.
Really?
And red clothes.
They all wore red clothes.
Both of them?
No, all three of them.
Three of them?
What are you talking about?
Three were murdered.
We just haven't found the third body.
This is a missing person form.
The name is quite unusual.
Dokko Hyun-soon, age 27.
It was two months ago, October 18.
Oh, her? Dokko Hyun-soon?
I know that girl.
Everyone in this town knows her.
A pretty girl,
that Hyun-soon.
Even a Miss Korea
is no match for her.
Did you process the missing
person form, Yong-gu?
Oh, shut up.
This is no ordinary incident, Chief.
If you look in detail.
Documents never lie.
It says she was
wearing a red shirt.
It's right here in writing.
What's that?
Marked here is the weather
on the day she vanished.
It rained on that day too.
Rain, red clothes...
She was murdered.
By the same person.
You don't know this town,
that's why you talk nonsense.
She always said she'd
go to Seoul one day...
I have an idea where the body is.
Look at the map.
Right here...
I marked where the victim went,
and where the body might be.
Give me two squadrons of
cops. I'll find her in two days.
You sure of this?
You know...
...university students,
when they go on orientation...
people say they
guys all get laid,
a big group, guys and girls,
in one room going at it...
Is that true?
I don't know. Hurry up.
You went to a 2-year
school, didn't you?
Student trips, orientation...
Did you go on those?
Go ask Suh, he went
to a 4-year university.
Whether he had group sex...
Shit, four years.
I spent 4 years in high school.
Shit, put that away.
You know, I miss
Dokko Hyun-soon.
You too?
She was just
too good for this town.
I'm telling you, she
went to Seoul.
What is it?
Lot of snakes down there.
Each part of a corpse
decays at a different speed.
Look. It's old,
but the inner thigh is still firm.
There's evidence of rape?
A bit of semen was found.
But it's so old, we can't
determine the blood type.
Oh, Hyun-soon...
This time too he used
items belonging to her.
Right, that's her stocking
around the throat?
Yes.
The victim's panties
on her face,
as with Hyang-sook.
Her hands were bound
the same way too.
His methods of killing
are quite professional.
He's thorough.
And polished.
So there hasn't been
a single witness yet.
Would you like
a bit more tenderloin?
That's okay. We're fine.
Where did Kwang-ho go?
I don't see him.
Is anything...?
I bought your son something,
give it to him later.
What's this?
Oh, last time, taking a
look at his sneakers,
they smelled so awful,
I felt bad for him.
I thought, I'll have to buy
him new shoes.
So I picked up some Nikes.
You didn't have to...
That punk, he's always sleeping
in the strangest places!
Kwang-ho!
This here...
your shoe size is 250mm, right?
Here, Nike. Try them on.
Give me that sneaker.
These are "Nice", not Nike.
N, l, C, E.
Nice or Nike. Who cares?
If you buy him sneakers,
you should get the real thing.
Cool, huh?
Have a drink.
I beat you because
I care for you.
So if you see me on the
street, don't run away.
Yong-gu feels bad about--
Punk.
Hey, where are you going again?
You see, Chief.
That boy is the exact opposite
of the type we're looking for.
Dragging in suspects like that
is a waste of time, so...
Inspector Suh!
Have some meat
before you speak.
I don't eat burnt meat.
& When the Spring flower blooms &
& You said you'd come back to me &
& Like the singing swallows &
& On the hills, singing birds and blooming flowers &
... & Alone on the hill &
Sir?
Hey, Seoul city bumpkin.
What?
Why did you come here?
Out to the boondocks?
To catch the killer.
Is Seoul that big?
Huh? Is it big?
Bigger than America?
Give me a banana.
Let me tell you about America.
They've got the F.B.I.!
If you watch how they
investigate... You know how?
Their heads are
spinning like a top.
Analyzing things...
You know why?
It's 'cause they got so
much fucking land!
If you don't use your brain,
it's too much ground to cover.
So they have no choice,
those F.B.I. bastards.
But our Republic of Korea...
using just your two legs,
you can run all over it.
You know why?
'Cause our land's
the size of my dick.
So it's said, Korean detectives
investigate with their feet.
That's folk wisdom,
you bastard.
So brainy geeks like you
can go the hell to America.
- Go there and...
- Shut your fucking mouth!
You bastard!
- Let go of me!
- What? You f...
Give him this.
Take it away! Take it!
Everything's clearer now.
That's much better.
I've got it now.
About the killer.
That bastard,
he'll do it again.
The next night it rains.
So we need to keep
one step ahead of him.
Pre-emptive!
Okay?
And if you two ever start
fighting in front of me again,
I'll kill you both! Understood?
Ladies and gentlemen!
In just a moment,
our President will be
driving past. Wait a minute...
It's raining nice.
You ready?
Ooh, Gui-ok's looking nice!
Shut up.
What if he grabs her for real?
Inspector Suh should be
following close behind her.
Shit, do we have to do
this every time when it rains?
But thanks to this,
Gui-ok puts on that red skirt.
With makeup, she looks
like a different person.
- So what?
- Was she always that pretty?
You getting hard?
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Let's check.
- We're on duty now...
- Oh, Yong-gu!
Hey.
So do you really
keep watch here?
These days, nobody
ever goes outside.
Someone's coming.
Hey, kids!
Over here.
That's cold.
You're so wet!
Hey, stay here
until the rain stops.
That umbrella's useless.
And we just picked it up
in front of the school.
Someone threw it away.
Miss, are you going
that way too?
Hey, she's a detective.
No way!
She's in the
Violent Crimes Division.
- Really?
- Sure.
Wait a minute.
We'll give you a ride.
Wow, in a police car!
Hey, you two. What are
you doing out so late?
We always stay together,
so it's okay.
You'll be fine
even if you go alone.
Nam-ju, tell them about
what you heard at school.
What?
You know, during cleaning
time, about the murderer.
Right! You know why they
can't catch the murderer?
This is the truth. We go to
Ansong Girls Middle School.
Behind our school,
there's an outhouse.
They say a crazy man lives
under there, the murderer!
He stays there all day,
and when night comes,
he sneaks out and kills women.
So when he comes out at night,
you must be able to smell
the shit from miles away.
That's not the story.
Yoo-jin said a crazy woman
fell in there and died.
Then I'll meet you in front of
the factory with an umbrella.
It's okay.
Okay.
I'll see you soon.
& Stand by me,
don't leave me. &
& I still love you.
Walking by myself... &
Hello?
Everyone stay where you are!
Don't touch anything near you.
Don't move one step!
Hey, you!
I'm talking to you!
Wait for the forensics team.
Look!
These are genuine footprints.
You see the
Remicon factory there?
He caught her near the factory,
and quietly pulled her
over 400 meters to here.
The footprints look
like a bride and groom's.
But you didn't find anything,
aside from the footprints?
I hoped to find fingerprints on
the umbrella, but no luck.
Not only that, due to the rain,
the footprints are all smudged.
Even after such a thorough
investigation, nothing.
Therefore, Chief, I think
this could be a hint. Hint!
What?
The fact that we found
nothing at the scene.
Always in rape cases,
at the crime scene,
there's one or two of
those hairs left behind.
So?
I'm saying the criminal must not
have any hair down there.
You mean hairless?
That's right, hairless.
A total baldie.
He can't leave hair behind,
because he doesn't have any?
For example,
a Buddhist monk who
shaved the hair down there.
It's a perfect crime.
Well, then.
Yongdeok Temple
is just next door.
Should we start there?
Hey Gui-ok, you've got
the radio on over there.
How would you like your coffee?
Lots of sugar for me.
- lnspector Suh!
- Yes, sir?
Do you have any more ideas?
I don't know.
As you saw today,
this criminal is flawless.
- So?
- Therefore,
our standard procedures
aren't going to help.
So what are we going to do?
Excuse me, but I've
got something to show you.
What will she show us today?
What's this?
These are documents
from an FM radio station.
Looks like a
broadcast schedule.
Yes, it's an evening music
program I listen to.
There's someone who keeps
requesting the song, "Sad Letter".
If you look, it lists the dates
this song was broadcast.
Actually, this isn't a very
popular song. It's quite rare.
A song? What letter?
"Sad Letter"
The singer is Yu Jae-ha.
Jo Young-pil's band.
- Sure, I heard it.
- So?
The song was broadcast on the
same days of the murders here.
Look.
October 20.
That's Park Bo-hee's murder.
December 19
was Lee Hyang-sook.
So...
...on last night's murder too,
this song was broadcast?
Yes. I listened to it myself.
containing the request.
"Sent by a lonely man
from Terung District."
"Please broadcast it
on a rainy day."
Miss Kwon, nice! Good idea!
You read too many mystery
novels as a student?
That was a nice story.
Chief, this can't
be a coincidence.
Look at this.
Documents never lie.
Christ, here we go again.
It seems he's a real psycho.
As soon as he hears the song,
he goes crazy.
Oh Chief, now you're doing
it too. This makes no sense!
It does make sense, sir!
It's quite simple.
Assemblies start with the
National Anthem. It's the same.
Did you get the postcard?
I requested it,
but the radio station's
a bit disorganized.
Find it quickly.
Check the postmark,
fingerprints and handwriting.
Yes, sir!
Officer Kwon, call the station
and follow up on this.
Baldies!
- What about that?
- Huh?
What we mentioned before...
Hairless, sir!
How do you investigate?
Pull the pants off passing men?
The postcard from yesterday.
I asked you to keep it!
What postcard?
You read it on the air yesterday!
Look how many we get here!
Hey, mister!
Nothing. Get dressed.
Inspector.
They've already
carted off yesterday's trash.
It's no use.
You're not going to shower?
Enough showers, for god's sake.
My skin feels like it'll burst.
You couldn't find
any hairless men?
Like looking for dog's horns.
Just paid sauna fees.
Shit, can't even get reimbursed.
At least your face is clean.
How many times in a day...
dressing, undressing, dressing...
I'll lose my hair there too.
I asked the workers
at the sauna there,
to call me if they saw anyone,
Bastards just smirked at me.
Don't do it all yourself,
have someone else do it.
What's that guy from Seoul
doing these days?
- Researching pop songs.
- What?
Shit, it's nothing
you've heard of.
Is he still talking nonsense?
Driving me crazy.
If you feel that way,
go see a shaman.
A shaman?
Sure, one that
tells fortunes well.
Ask her where the
murderer is hiding.
A problem at the main gate
of the police station.
It should be moved about
A face just passed by me.
I think he's the one.
Is his face among
these pictures here?
Take those dirty photos away.
- Hey, just look...
- Put them away!
It's bad fortune.
- Take this, and do what I say.
- Don't try to sell that charm.
Wait, wait a minute.
You have to mix in dirt
from the crime scene.
Stir.
She said that
was most important.
Now pour it.
Stop.
Good.
Once this dries,
this stain will form the
shape of the murderer's face.
That's ridiculous.
Quiet, you'll break the charm.
Know how much this costs?
So shut up!
Who's that?
Don't you know?
Criminals always return
to the crime scene.
Wait a sec.
What's he doing here?
Why'd he come?
What the fuck...
We need science here!
What the hell's that?
Still, he's got style.
