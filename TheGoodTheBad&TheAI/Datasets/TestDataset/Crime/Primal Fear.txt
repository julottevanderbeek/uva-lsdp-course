MARTIN:
First day of law school...
my professor says two things--
first, from this day forward...
when your mother says she
loves you, get a second opinion.
JACK: Ha ha. And...
MARTIN: If you want justice,
go to a whorehouse.
If you wanna get fucked,
go to court.
Naomi!
JACK: Let's say
you know a client's guilty.
MARTIN:
Don't even start with that.
Our justice system doesn't care,
and neither do I.
Every defendant,
regardless of what he's done...
has the right
to the best defense possible.
JACK:
Where were you with the truth?
MARTIN: Truth?
How do you mean? Naomi!
JACK: How many ways
are there to mean it?
MARTIN:
You think there's only one?
NAOMl: You're late.
MARTIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Actually, you're right.
There's only one that matters--
my version of it...
the one I create
in the minds of the jury.
You can call it something else--
the illusion of truth...
if you want.
NAOMl: OK.
MARTIN: Jack, is that it?
You need more?
-Yeah.
-Tomorrow afternoon?
I'll have my secretary
set it up.
OK.
-This is a cover story, right?
-Yeah.
Yeah. OK, bye.
CHOIR:  Alleluia.
Alleluia.
Alleluia.
MC: Saint Michael's boys choir.
Thank you.
You're a talented group.
Right now, we're going to have
a brief photo session...
while we have the boys
with his excellency.
I'll be back soon.
Bear with us, enjoy dessert,
and thank you.
RUSHMAN: Ah, yes.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Here we go.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Thank you.
RUSHMAN: Thank you.
Mangia, mangia.
JOHN: Thanks.
Marty.
What an unexpected surprise.
MARTIN: I'm getting
our prosecutor off the hook.
JOHN: What'll it cost?
A lot less than the alternative.
Tomorrow, my office, 9:30.
Is this on?
Ooh, yes.
We have come to the heart
of the matter...
the reason we've all gathered.
This is the fifth straight year
it's been my privilege...
to serve as your master
of ceremonies...
for the Chicago Bar Association
and Catholic Charities Ball.
MAN: You have to put that out.
JANET:
It's a bar, for Christ's sake.
MC: Tonight,
due to your generous efforts...
we've broken last year's record
in terms of attendees...
MARTIN: I thought you quit.
JANET: I cut down.
MARTIN: You look beautiful.
Cut your hair?
JANET: Yeah. A few months ago.
MC: As it has been
my pleasure...
MARTIN: Want to dance?
MC: I'm pleased to introduce...
JANET: There isn't any music.
MARTIN: Sure, there is.
MC: ...state's attorney,
God love him...
Mr. John Shaughnessy.
To her shoulder...
Time...
JOHN: Thank you very much.
MARTIN: All you have to do
is turn around.
JANET:
You like it better like this.
That way you don't have
to look at the person.
MARTIN: Oh, mean.
JOHN: Considering the hour...
MARTIN: Look at me.
JOHN: I want to thank you
for supporting the archbishop.
Let's find a bar
you can smoke in.
Thanks for the invite...
but I don't like
one-night stands much.
We saw each other for months.
It was a one-night stand, Marty.
It just lasted six months.
RUSHMAN: Thanks, John.
Ahem. I must say...
I haven't seen this many
lawyers and politicians...
gathered in one place
since confession this morning.
YANCY: The people
are not going to tolerate...
a monetary award to a cockroach
who deserves 20 to life.
He may be your client...
but Joey Pinero
is a hard-case felon.
Dealing, racketeering, money
laundering, attempted murder.
Dealing, racketeering, money
laundering, attempted murder.
MARTIN:
Did you say alleged, Yancy?
Did you hear him say alleged?
Mr. Pinero has never been
convicted of anything.
Cops jumped him,
left him bleeding in the snow.
It's a miracle he survived.
Having said that,
I'm not opposed to a settlement.
Million-five,
and Pinero leaves the state.
You can't limit his citizen's
right to live wherever he wants.
Legally, that's unenforceable.
JOHN: Whether it's enforceable
or a gentlemen's agreement...
Mr. Pinero will know
what we want.
Get the answer
you're looking for.
Don't sit around and chat.
It's been a pleasure.
You're worse than the thugs
you represent.
JOHN: That's enough, Bud.
It's over.
MARTIN:
I got to run this by him.
JOHN: You're on 40% commission.
I'm assured your recommendation
will prevail.
Thank you, John.
RUSHMAN: My hand!
Oh, shit.
-Hey.
-Mr. Vail.
-Hey.
-Mr. Vail.
MARTIN: How you doing?
JOEY: Buena.
Nice tune.
Dame dos tequilas para aqui.
WOMAN: OK, mi hijito.
JOEY: What'd they say?
MARTIN: Take it or leave it
for a million-five.
From Shaughnessy himself.
What do you think?
We should take it...
unless you wanna spend two years
in appellate court.
Fuck that.
-Close it.
-Done.
JOEY: Gracias.
OK.
MARTIN: Gracias.
Salud.
MARTIN: Salud.
-Mia?
-Your shot.
MARTIN:
There's one more little thing.
They want you
to, uh, leave the state.
They want you to disappear.
Disappear?
That's good.
Same bullshit, right?
What are you talking about?
Ah.
I keep getting these offers
from these guys, Marty.
MARTIN: What offers?
A couple of months ago,
a cop walks in.
He says, "You testify against
Alderman Martinez...
"and we'll owe you, Joey."
Say he did you favors,
say he's on your payroll...
shit like that, right?
I tell him to fuck himself.
Why?
Because Martinez is a good man.
He's the only one holding out...
while the others
try to turn South River...
into high-rent condos.
MARTIN:
Why didn't you tell me before?
Why?
Because this happens every day.
I didn't think
it had anything to do with this.
MARTIN: Oh, you don't?
I've spent a lot of money here.
They've spent a lot more.
These people depend on me.
I don't give a shit.
Send them checks
from California.
Chucho, hazme favor.
Saca mi cd.
JOEY: I respect your advice,
but I can't take it.
I'll take the money,
but I ain't going anywhere.
MARTIN: I don't like it.
JOEY: Chucho, dame.
What are they gonna do,
kill me?
MARTIN: They tried once.
How are they going to kill a man
who never sleeps?
-Get the money.
-You're too much.
JOEY: Hey.
That song you like--fourth cut.
MARTIN: Very nice, thank you.
JOEY: Yeah.
STENNER:
We got enough fucking cops here?
Police will have
their hands full.
WOMAN: Captain Stenner,
can you tell us anything?
STENNER: I don't know anything.
I just got here.
MAN: What's going on?
STENNER:
I haven't seen anything yet.
I'll go inside,
come out and tell you.
HARVEY:
You should be home in bed, Abel.
It's going around.
STENNER:
I'll consider that, Harvey.
STENNER: Christ.
HARVEY: What a mess, huh?
WEIL:
Sam, you got all you need?
Gently roll him over.
OFFICER: Police! Stop!
WEIL: Right thumb
and forefinger severed.
The symbol "B32.156"
is carved into the chest.
WEIL:
Body temperature still warm.
DETECTIVE:
We got one on the run.
TV: A passing train
has separated the suspect...
MARTIN:
You want to know what I hate?
I hate when they go on
about what big whores...
the defense attorneys are.
We're the bad guys.
Because we're sitting
next to some creep...
we start to look creepy.
Plus, they assume
they're guilty...
and we know or something.
You don't know.
You don't ask, you don't care.
You do the goddamn job.
It's not like
they're your friends.
Some are your friends, but...
JACK: Why'd you leave
the state's attorney's office?
MARTIN: Dead-end job.
You either run for office,
or you end up a judge.
Why become an umpire
when you can play ball?
TV: ...into the area
around Saint Michael's...
and the archbishop's mansion.
Over here!
He's over here!
TV: We will stay
with this shocking story...
as it continues to unfold
throughout the day.
What we do know...
is that at approximately
When did you know you had them?
What? Sorry.
During the Pinero trial, when
did you say, "l've got them"?
The day I took the case.
Excuse me.
TV: The shocking murder
this morning...
of one of Chicago's
most beloved figures...
Archbishop Richard Rushman...
has left the city numb.
We have Andy live.
ANDY: Chicago police have
arrested a 19-year-old man...
tentatively identified
as Aaron Stampler.
According
to Captain Abel Stenner...
We have to reschedule.
Call my office. I'm sorry.
Law offices of Martin Vail.
MARTIN: You got the news on?
We're watching it.
Call Sullivan
in Judge Trotter's office.
Find out where they took him
and call me at the Alibi.
A lot of guys will want
this one.
The police have taken
the first steps...
acting with speed
and determination.
MAN: Are you taking
the Stampler case?
MARTIN: I'm sorry.
I can't talk about anything now.
Thank you very much.
WOMAN: When will you talk?
MARTIN:
State's attorney left yet?
MAN: Yeah. Yancy, no less.
-P.D.?
-Come and gone.
MAN: Lockup!
MARTIN:
Give my best to your brother.
MAN: Yeah, sure.
I'd like to see him alone.
All right.
I'll have to lock you in.
Understood.
You know who I am?
Well...no.
No, sir. No, I don't.
My name is Martin Vail.
I'm what you call
a, um, big-shot attorney.
Oh, I don't--
I don't have no money.
I didn't think you did.
I'm willing to take
your case pro bono...
which means you get my expertise
and hard work for free.
Or you could get
the $40,000-a-year...
court-appointed public defender
who will almost certainly...
escort you personally
to death row. Your choice.
No. N-no, sir.
I would be gr-grateful
for anything you could do.
You're welcome. Ahem.
Now, your full name is?
AARON:
What? Oh. Aaron Luke Stamp--
St-Stampler.
Stampler.
You from Kentucky, Aaron?
AARON:
Yes, sir. I'm from Creekside.
Does it say that there?
MARTIN: How long you been here
in Chicago?
Well,
two years next month, I think.
MARTIN: You ever been arrested?
No. No, sir.
MARTIN:
How do you know the archbishop?
Well, um...
I was begging on the street
up on Wacker Drive.
Bishop Rushman came by
in his Cadillac.
He s-saw me, and he stopped.
He took me into Savior House.
I work as an altar boy.
I--I sing in his choir.
How long were you there--
Savior House?
AARON: Year, year and a half.
You're supposed to leave
when you're 18, but...
but Bishop Rushman
let--Iet me stay on...
way past my 19th birthday.
That was nice of him.
Yes. Yes, it was.
Aaron, did you have any reason
to dislike the archbishop?
Aaron, did you have any reason
to dislike the archbishop?
Dislike him? No. No, sir.
He was...
He was like a father to me.
Yeah, but you...
How do I say this?
Were you in the room
when he was murdered?
How can you explain that?
There was someone else
in that room, Mr. Vail.
-A third person?
-Yes, sir.
MARTIN:
Did you tell the police?
Yes, I did,
but they didn't believe me.
You tell me now.
I was--I was returning a book
to Bishop Rushman's library.
I heard noise,
so I went back into his--
in his bedroom.
Bishop--Bishop Rushman
was laying on the floor.
There--there was blood
all over everything.
Then I seen a shadow.
I seen a person...
Ieaning over Bishop Rushman.
It looked up, then came at me,
and that's when...
when I lost the time.
What does that mean,
"lost time"?
I--I bla-bla--I blacked out.
It just--
It happens to me sometimes.
I just--I have...
Spells. Sp--I have spells.
I lose time. I can't...
I can't remember nothing.
Why did you run from the police
if you did nothing wrong?
Well, when...
When I woke up, I was--
I was covered in blood.
I didn't know what to do.
I got scared.
I heard sirens, so I ran.
I know how it looks,
but I swear--
I don't need you to convince me.
Just answer my questions.
But I didn't do this.
You gotta believe me.
MARTIN: I don't have
to believe you. I don't care.
I'm your attorney,
which means I am your mother...
father, best friend, and priest.
In other words,
talk only to me from now on.
Not the cops, press,
other guys in the cells...
nobody without my permission,
understand?
Yeah?
Yes, I do.
MARTIN: All right.
Now the important stuff.
What's your suit size?
My--my what?
Suit size. About a 38?
Uh...
How would I know?
I don't know.
About a 38-long.
TV: Stampler was flushed
by the police...
from his hiding place
behind the cathedral.
The police chased him
through the train yard...
almost losing him
as he scrambled over tracks...
before an oncoming train,
separating him from the police.
Prominent local criminal
defense attorney Martin Vail...
is believed to have
visited Stampler--
After a brief chase
across the rail yard...
behind Saint Michael's
Cathedral...
Stampler was apprehended
in a hole beneath train tracks.
REPORTER:
Are you defending this man?
MARTIN: I'm sorry. I can't--
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
We've taken the first step
in the process.
I can now take your questions.
MAN: Can you tell us anything
about the altar boy group...
that Aaron Stampler was part of?
JOHN: Not much at this time.
WOMAN:
Do you suspect other altar boys?
JOHN:
We suspect no one but Stampler.
He had access
to the archbishop's quarters.
He was caught
fleeing Saint Michael's.
Aaron Stampler was chased
under McCormick place.
NAOMl:
Law office of Martin Vail.
He'll call as soon
as he gets in.
I talked to him. OK. Bye.
-Naomi!
-Yeah.
MARTIN: Sorry I'm late.
We have a new client.
NAOMl:
I was afraid you'd say that.
Who?
They're calling him
the butcher boy of Saint Mike's.
MARTIN: I like that.
NAOMl:
Good. You'll hear it a lot.
TOMMY: This kid who chopped up
the archbishop?
MARTIN: Tommy, you've got
to use the word "allegedly"...
especially if you
want to be a lawyer.
He admits he was in the room
when the killing occurred...
but he didn't actually
see it happen.
He was returning a book
to the archbishop.
He heard loud noises
in the bedroom.
He went in.
He sees a figure...
someone in the shadows
kneeling over the body.
He blacks out.
Next thing he knows...
sirens are screaming,
he's covered in blood.
The cops find him
in a train tunnel.
He's got the archbishop's ring
in his pocket.
TOMMY: He stole it?
I didn't say that.
It was in his pocket.
Is that it?
Yup.
That's, um...
That's bullshit.
That's the worst bullshit story
I've ever heard.
Now it's our bullshit story.
Let's get to work.
The name of the game
is motive...
as in, the prosecution
doesn't have one.
We need to prove...
someone else could have
committed the crime...
then we can establish
reasonable doubt.
I wanna know everything
I can about this guy.
We go to database,
Hall of Records, IRS files...
even his so-called charities.
So-called?
The guy was a priest.
Naomi, write this down--
B32.156.
That was carved
into the archbishop's chest.
-Allegedly.
-No.
That was a fact,
but I appreciate the effort.
Thanks.
I also need case histories
on murder by stabbing...
murder by mutilation,
murder by religion.
Also, I'm gonna need
a psychiatrist.
NAOMl: You're telling me.
MARTIN: Not the kind
that lives in a witness box.
I need a real one.
And someone who knows
about amnesia.
What does he look like
in person?
The butcher boy?
Like a boy scout.
A boy scout...
with a merit badge in carving.
YANCY: The archbishop was
a friend of Mr. Shaughnessy's.
He asked me who was my best man.
I said you.
JANET: Thank you.
I trust if I am
to prosecute this case...
I'll be given the authority
requisite to this assignment.
JOHN:
You're the one trying the case.
Let's establish
one thing at the outset.
I want the death penalty.
JANET:
I'd like to go over the case...
before we make a determination
about the death penalty.
JOHN:
I'm open to anything you say...
but in my mind,
there's no debate.
Did he say anything,
the boy they picked up?
Yeah--he didn't do it.
YANCY: It's a slam dunk, Janet.
JANET: Excuse me.
I appreciate your faith in me...
and I don't mean to be
argumentative--
YANCY:
That's what we pay you for.
If it's so open and shut,
you don't need me.
The P.D. will plead no contest
and seek the court's mercy.
There's not a public defender.
He's got a lawyer?
Already? Who?
I'm Martin Vail.
I'm defending Aaron Stampler.
I need to inspect
the murder site.
The butcher boy, huh?
Thank you. Yes.
I forgot his real name.
JANET: What's the matter,
Marty, lost your faith?
Looking for a little religion?
Which one of us
is the true headline chaser?
Unlike you,
I was assigned to this case.
Think you're up to it?
Sell the book rights yet,
or are you waiting?
Want to see some pictures?
Come on.
They're kind of cute.
You'll agree they clearly show
the heinous nature of the crime.
MARTIN:
A small piece of advice--
don't use the word
"heinous" in court.
Half the jury
won't understand it.
One small piece of advice--
I'm not sitting second chair
to you anymore.
In case you hadn't noticed,
I graduated.
I had no reason to leave.
You had every reason to leave.
How can you still work for them?
You really expect me
to trot out after you, Marty?
Quit just because you did?
I don't need a Mercedes.
I don't need to see my face
on the evening news.
You knew I was coming here,
didn't you?
You knew I would defend him.
You asked Shaughnessy for this.
Oh, please...
What's the matter, you nervous?
Been a while since you rubbed up
against a woman with a brain?
What's the matter? You tired,
haven't been sleeping well?
You're the one
with the score to settle.
I sleep great at night.
MARTIN: Thanks.
MARTIN: Hey. Where is he?
OFFICER: Over here.
MARTIN: We'll be sitting
at a table with my associates.
Once the charges are read,
the judge'll ask how you plead.
-Not--not guilty.
-No.
But I'm not guilty, Mr. Vail.
MARTIN: It doesn't matter.
Keep your mouth shut.
Don't say anything.
AARON: You're going to say
I'm not guilty?
I'll say whatever I say.
Don't worry.
But, Mr. Vail--
This can't go on in court,
so get used to it now.
I speak. You do not speak.
Your job is to sit there
and look innocent.
I am innocent.
That's it! That's exactly
how you should look.
That's exactly it.
Can you remember that?
That's the look.
AARON:
This is how I always look.
MARTIN: Then you're way ahead
of the game already.
Don't smile.
Don't...
WOMAN: Can we have a statement?
MARTIN: No. We're gonna
find out what happened.
MAN:
What about public pressure?
MARTIN: The only pressure
is to find the truth.
MAN: Was the archbishop's
blood on him?
MARTIN: You've been
talking to the police.
They usually
get everything wrong.
WOMAN: How do you explain
his blood-soaked clothing?
MARTIN: Currently,
I'm not explaining anything.
I've only recently
been retained.
Significant facts are in dispute
and continue to be in dispute.
MAN: You're a master at putting
the victim on trial.
That will be difficult
in this case.
MARTIN: A victim is my client.
We have two victims here,
no suspects. Thank you.
Thank you.
JOHN: I don't think there'll be
any question about the verdict.
All rise.
JUDGE: Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.
Bailiff?
BAILIFF:
State vs. Aaron Stampler.
Sit down. Is everyone here?
BAILIFF: Yes, Your Honor.
JUDGE: Madam prosecutor?
The state charges Aaron Stampler
with murder in the first degree.
How does your client plead,
counselor?
I need time to make a complete
psychiatric evaluation...
before any charges are brought.
JANET: We have more than enough
evidence for the allegations.
I agree. Motion denied.
Mr. Stampler...
do you understand the charges?
AARON: Yes.
I direct my client
not to answer...
because his response
may tend to incriminate him.
He's taking the fifth on whether
he understands the charges?
Yes, Your Honor.
Until a psychological
evaluation...
he'll be taking the fifth
on all questions posed.
The State vs. Appleby...
if you'll review our precedent.
Thank you.
Nah, I can't do that. Nah.
What do you want?
TOMMY: I'm looking for the room
Aaron Stampler stayed in.
You the police?
I'm his uncle.
Unh!
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
MARTIN: Thanks.
AARON: Well, hey.
This--this is Alex's.
Who's Alex?
He's one
of the other altar boys.
An altar boy?
An altar boy was wearing this?
Well, not--not at Mass.
MARTIN: This altar boy attacked
a colleague of mine.
He hurt him pretty bad.
What was he doing in your room?
-My room?
-Yeah.
I--I can't...
I can't--I don't know.
I mean, I don't.
Know where to find him?
AARON: Who? Alex?
Uh-huh.
AARON:
I don't know where he is.
Who's Linda?
Lin-Linda?
She your girlfriend?
Where is she?
I'd like to talk to her.
AARON:
I don't know where she is.
Why do I feel you're not
telling me something?
AARON: I'm telling the truth.
I don't think so.
Are you surprised that Alex
attacked my friend?
No.
No, I mean, he has a temper.
Yeah. I'd say so.
You think it could be Alex...
who was that figure you saw
at the archbishop's room?
I c--Alex?
I couldn't be sure.
But it could be him?
I don't--I don't know.
The state wants you dead.
Help me,
or that's what they'll get.
I--
I'm trying.
I can't--can't remember.
I don't understand.
Why would Alex do such a thing?
For his own reasons.
Maybe someone hired him.
H-hired by who?
I don't know.
Forget the whole thing.
Do you think he's capable
of doing it?
I--I don't know. He...
I don't know
who's capable of such a thing.
MARTIN: Oh, thanks.
ARRINGTON: Sure.
He claims someone else
was in the room...
and that he can't remember.
You want me to look into
this amnesia question...
and see what he actually knows?
Yeah.
What if he knows he did it?
The major causes
of amnesia are...
substance abuse, seizures,
head injuries, and malingering.
I think the kid's
telling the truth.
OK.
Then let's get
something straight.
I'm more than happy
to analyze him.
In fact,
I'm looking forward to it.
But I won't just validate
a story, understood?
You do your job, I do mine.
Yadda, yadda.
ARRINGTON: That's right.
If I think it's necessary...
I'd want to get an MRl, EEG,
and neuropsych testing, agreed?
MARTIN: Yes, Doctor.
Good night, Doctor.
ARRINGTON: I'll be recording
our meetings for Mr. Vail...
so what we talk about
isn't as confidential...
as if you were consulting
with a doctor for help.
He may call me as a witness...
so if you have questions,
ask while he's here.
N-no. No, ma'am.
I understand.
Good.
I think we'll be fine.
-See you later.
-OK.
Bye.
ARRINGTON:
Was there a period of time...
surrounding
the archbishop's death...
that you don't remember?
AARON: Yeah--yes.
I lo--Iost the time.
I mean--I mean,
I b-blacked out.
Have you had these
blackouts before?
AARON: Yes. Yes, I have.
When's the first time
you remember them happening?
Um...
They st-st-started
when I was about 12.
Were your parents aware
of what was happening?
N-no. No.
My--my...my mother was dead.
ARRINGTON: And your father?
Mm-mmm. No. No. No.
He was not--not a nice man.
Did you seek treatment?
Did I what?
Uh, did you see a doctor
for them?
Oh.
No. No.
You don't see a doctor
in Creekside...
You don't see a doctor
in Creekside...
unless your leg's broke.
MARTIN:
Hey. Can I talk to you?
JANET: Talk.
MARTIN: Excuse us.
I'll bring her right back.
JANET: How dare you.
Am I some chess piece
to move around?
I was having lunch.
When are we getting
all the discovery?
What do you want, Marty?
MARTIN: To know when
we're getting discovery.
I've got motions to file.
JANET: No, you don't.
You're looking to make a deal.
I have no authority to deal.
I haven't discussed this
with my client.
If we needed to deal,
I have all the authority I want.
Bullshit. Shaughnessy
wants the whole shot...
and he's using you to get it.
Anybody in your position
would deal this down...
to murder with no death penalty.
My position?
We have a fucking great case.
Great case?
Lack of prior record,
no eyewitness...
no confession, no motive.
Hard evidence.
I assume this means you're not
going with insanity...
which is a shame.
My shrinks
would have torn him apart.
By the way, pleading the fifth
on the charges was brilliant.
-It was good, wasn't it?
-Yeah.
I liked it.
You lose this case...
you take the fall,
not Shaughnessy.
Talk to me.
JANET: We're going to trial.
It only takes one...
just one juror
that doesn't believe he did it.
One juror looks into that face--
I got to admit,
that face is great.
Are you prepping him
to take the stand?
That stutter--
it's p-p-priceless.
Oh, Marty...
don't tell me you think
he didn't do it.
Has little Aaron Stampler
gotten to you?
We're not just talking jail.
It's about ending
someone's life.
If you're wrong
and do this for Shaughnessy...
can you live with it?
I'll live.
See you in court.
MARTIN: We stipulate
that murder was done here.
Therefore, these photographs
have no probative value.
JANET: This is a case
of mutilation and torture.
The only reason
the prosecution...
wants to show these pictures
is shock appeal.
JANET: That's not true.
They identify the heinous
nature of the crime...
and they connect the defendant
to the crime scene.
-Prejudicial.
-I beg to differ.
MARTIN: Beg all you want.
JUDGE: Counsel, please.
The photographs are in.
Would you two like a recess
to carry on in private?
Sorry, Your Honor,
but the next thing you know...
he'll be objecting if we bring
in the murder weapon.
Now that she brings it up...
MARTIN:
This is a public building.
Excuse me, Mr. Vail...
would you sign this for me?
ARRINGTON: Tell me about Linda,
your girlfriend.
Y-yes. Yes, she was.
How'd you meet?
Uh, we was both
at the Savior House.
I was an altar boy.
She--she was doing work
for Bishop Rushman.
What was the relationship like?
AARON: M-me and Linda?
Mm-hmm.
She was real cultural.
Real cultural and very smart.
We--we had a nice time together.
W-we might get married.
Were you sleeping together?
Well, that's private.
ARRINGTON: I know.
I have to ask the question.
Were you having
a sexual relationship?
Y-yes. Yes, we were.
ARRINGTON: Were you sleeping
with anyone else at the time?
No.
Was she?
Has she been to see you, Aaron?
Well--well, no, but--
ARRINGTON: And that upsets you?
AARON: No.
No, thing is,
she--she went away.
She went away for a while.
She left b-before this happened.
I don't even think...
don't even think
she knows about it.
-Yo, boss.
-Hey.
-Got something for me?
-Yeah.
NAOMl: There's nothing
catalogued at downtown branch...
under the numbers B32.156...
but I think the "B"
is actually an 8.
I think the knife slipped.
"Thomas Jefferson"?
I don't think he did it.
You won't be much
happier with this--
a list
of the archbishop's charities...
and his foundation's
investments.
Nothing startling here,
except for how many there are.
Wait a minute here.
What was he doing
with the South River deal?
Pull that up.
Who are the investors?
Shaughnessy?
That's Joey Pinero's
neighborhood.
JOEY: See this lot here?
This all used to be houses.
In fact, there was a house
over on the corner...
where I kissed
my first girlfriend.
Got her pregnant, too.
MARTIN: Hell of a kiss, Joey.
JOEY: Oh, yeah.
This whole neighborhood's
gonna end up high-rent condos...
if those guys get their way.
That's why I'm buying back
the lot with the settlement.
You heard about that, right?
The money?
ALDERMAN: Who hasn't?
JOEY: Marty's the best.
MARTIN: Just doing my job.
JOEY: Yeah. A million-five,
he's just doing his job.
MARTIN: Alderman, Joey tells me
a cop came around...
wanting him to set you up.
ALDERMAN: It's typical.
Can't buy me,
so they try and buy a brother.
Most people assume
this land we're walking on...
belongs to the railroad,
but it doesn't.
It belongs to the church.
-The church?
-Mm-hmm.
So that's
the Rushman Foundation?
ALDERMAN: Right, along with
a bunch of rich developers.
Including John Shaughnessy?
ALDERMAN: Oh, yeah.
Then they got greedy,
buying up all the land...
and old buildings around
the church property...
then tearing it down.
Our old neighborhood
was gonna to disappear.
So I asked the archbishop...
"What are you doing
to these people?
"They're poor.
"They're getting kicked
out of their homes...
"and they're Catholic."
JOEY: Fuckin'-A.
ALDERMAN: He listened.
I couldn't believe it.
He told them to stop developing
around the church property.
MARTIN: So the partners are
holding these empty buildings...
they can't knock down
and land they can't build on.
Shaughnessy loses millions.
ALDERMAN: Mm-hmm.
MARTIN: lf I need you to,
will you testify?
JOEY: Who, me? Oh, yeah.
Easy.
Just change out of this,
put on a Brooks Brothers...
with loafers and tassels,
you bet.
MARTIN: Not--not you.
ALDERMAN: Sure.
I'll testify.
SHAUGHNESSY:
You know what people think--
think this great city
runs itself.
It gets up, goes to work...
and climbs into bed
at night like we do.
They're unaware of what it takes
to see it doesn't break down--
crime, fires, riots...
the goddamn water pipes
bursting under the city.
What a fucking mess that was.
Who does
the water commissioner call...
the contractor who built it?
No. He calls me.
They all call me.
God damn, this is terrific.
They call me,
because I keep the peace.
That's my job.
This city doesn't burn
because I won't permit it.
I'm the great negotiator.
You think people get that?
Truth is, I don't care.
Dumb bastards don't even vote.
All they want to do is eat,
sleep, watch TV...
and occasionally
fuck their wives.
MARTIN: Guess we should all
thank you.
SHAUGHNESSY: Ha.
You're welcome.
John,
you need some new material.
I've heard this
great city speech 10 times.
Your boy Pinero's not honoring
his side of the deal.
Is that what this
dinner's about? Pinero?
In part.
MARTIN:
I told him what the deal is.
He's a grownup.
What's the other part?
I understand your assistant's
been digging around...
in the archbishop's
financial affairs.
Yeah. Well...
How much did you lose...
when he pulled the plug
from South River, John?
Let me tell you something.
It's a mistake to stick
your thumb...
in the eyes of the most
powerful people in the city.
MARTIN: It's not their eyes
I'm aiming for.
Do not fuck with me, Marty.
Pipes are bursting again, John.
ECKERT: ln the most anticipated
murder trial...
in recent Chicago history...
former State's Attorney
prosecutor Martin Vail...
will lead with
his opening statement...
on behalf
of Aaron Stampler...
JANET: Richard Rushman
was a man of God.
He spent his life giving
to the people of Chicago.
He was a beacon
of inspiration...
not only
as a spiritual leader...
YU: ...Deliver his opening
statement tomorrow...
MARTIN:
My name is Martin Vail.
The reason I'm here,
and you're here...
is to make sure
that the truth is known.
Now, we can begin
to learn the truth...
by talking about
what the prosecution...
does not want you to hear.
JANET: Do not be fooled...
by the defendant's innocent
appearance and demeanor.
Aaron Stampler...
sat in judgment
of Archbishop Rushman...
and determined that
not only should he die...
but he should die
the most brutal...
MARTIN: Aaron was arrested
within minutes...
of the Archbishop's death.
We all saw it on television.
But why?
Because he was convenient.
Because there was enormous
pressure to solve this crime.
JANET: The evidence will show
that Aaron Stampler...
stalked, ambushed, and savagely
murdered this great man.
MARTIN: The prosecution
doesn't want you to hear...
about the other
altar boys in the choir...
who have mysteriously
disappeared.
JANET: You will learn
that Aaron Stampler...
had everything he needed
for the perfect assassination.
Using this knife...
Aaron Stampler
repeatedly stabbed...
at the archbishop's chest...
his genitals, his eyes.
MARTIN:
They don't want you to hear...
that the archbishop
made investments...
on behalf of
the Roman Catholic church...
and that those investments
resulted in huge losses...
for some
very, very powerful people.
They don't want you
to hear about...
the 20 death threats
this year alone...
that the archbishop
received prior to death.
And they really
don't want you to hear...
about their theory of motive.
And why is that? Very simple.
They don't have one.
JANET: lnspector Woodside,
can you explain to the court...
where these sneakers
came from?
WOODSIDE: They were taken off
the defendant...
when he was apprehended.
JANET: And what was the result
of the bloodstain analysis?
WOODSIDE: The result
proved to be human blood...
matching the blood type
and DNA characteristics...
of Archbishop Rushman.
JANET: What do the footprints
surrounding the body say?
The killer left a pattern
of bloody footprints...
around the area
of the struggle...
as indicated by the spread
of blood through the room.
MARTIN: Yes or no, lnspector--
could there have been
a third person there?
WOODSIDE: There is no evidence
to suggest that.
But there's no evidence
to prove there wasn't.
No.
And after the struggle,
what happened then?
WOODSIDE: Analysis suggests
the killer was startled...
during the mutilation...
and ran downstairs
from the bedroom.
Is it possible, lnspector...
that the real killer--
a third person--
who maybe was smart enough...
not to tramp a freeway
of blood through the place...
couldn't this person have placed
the defendant's prints...
on the knife
while he was passed out?
Mr. Vail, anything is possible.
JANET: So, the victim suffered
a great number of stab wounds?
WEIL: Yes, he did--78.
He tried to defend himself.
That explains the cuts
to hands and forearms.
Doctor, isn't it a fact
that you can't be sure...
whether more than
one person inflicted...
these 78 stab
and incise wounds?
WEIL: It could've been more
than one, but I doubt it.
From your analysis of
the knife wounds, Dr. Weil...
do you have an opinion
whether the killer...
was left or right-handed?
WEIL: The throat wound
and chest wounds...
were made from an angle
that strongly suggests...
a left-handed person
was using the knife.
To your knowledge,
is the defendant left-handed?
Yes, he is.
It's possible
that a right-handed person...
could've deliberately
used his left hand...
to inflict these wounds.
Yes, that is possible.
Then it would be
reasonable to assume...
that there was a third person
at the crime scene?
Reasonable, no,
but it is possible.
ANCHOR: Then following
opening statements...
it was a day of strong
and detailed testimony...
from the prosecution's
first witnesses--
Cook County Forensics Chief
Harvey Woodside...
and Cook County
Medical Examiner Emil Weil.
There was also tough
cross-examination...
by Stampler defense attorney
Martin Vail.
By most accounts, though,
the prosecution...
JANET: Captain Stenner,
I'd like to thank you...
for all the time
you've given us today.
Finally, I would like
to turn your attention...
to the symbol carved in
the archbishop's chest.
Would you tell the jury
about that, Captain?
STENNER: Yes. The letter
and the numbers B32.156...
were carved into
the archbishop's chest.
JANET: Have you been able
to find an identical reference?
I believe so, yes.
The symbol--B32.156--
is actually
catalog code for a book...
discovered in
a private reading room...
Iocated
in the church basement.
The B32 part
refers to a book--
The Scarlet Letter
by Nathaniel Hawthorne.
When we opened the book
to page 156...
we discovered
an underlined passage.
JANET: Would you please read
this underlined passage...
to the court?
"No man,
for any considerable period...
"can wear one face to himself...
"and another to the multitude...
"without finally
getting bewildered...
"as to which may be the true."
Thank you.
What does that passage
mean to you, Captain?
MARTIN: Objection.
He's a policeman,
not an English professor.
His interpretation would be
speculative and irrelevant.
She didn't ask
for an expert opinion.
The witness can answer.
Well, to me, it's simple.
The killer thought
his victim was two-faced.
Dishonest at something.
JANET:
ln your experience, Captain...
do killers ever intentionally
leave clues to their motive?
CAPTAIN:
Not often, but it happens.
MARTIN: Thanks.
-Thanks.
-Yeah, sure.
Did you underline that book?
Did I what?
Did you underline that book?
-No, Mr. Vail.
-No?
I never even opened
The Scarlet Letter.
I don't--don't like Hawthorne.
I tried to read that one about
the house with seven somethings.
I couldn't get past page ten.
I weren't the only one using
Bishop Rushman's library.
Everybody borrowed books
from Bishop Rushman.
He encouraged it.
Altar boys and staff--
everyone was in there.
MARTIN: Guard?
Thanks.
MARTIN:
You don't give up, do you?
JACK: So, you didn't know
anything about Hawthorne?
-No.
-What about the impact--
MARTIN: Look, I can't talk now.
My office will call you.
-Thanks.
-I'll see you.
Bye.
Bye.
What the fuck
happened in there?
I guess that eight
was a "B" after all.
MARTIN: Think this is funny?
We're losing this case.
Tommy, how could you
have missed that?
TOMMY: There's 50 of them, plus
the entire police department.
How was I to know
he had a private reading room?
-It's your job.
-Want my job?
I want you to do
your fucking job!
I'm working on
a third man defense.
Have you figured that out yet?
I don't have a third man.
You know why?
'Cause you can't
fucking find him !
Is it that hard to find
one indigent kid?
NAOMl: Maybe we already got
the kid who did this.
We have to at least
consider the possibility.
All the hard evidence
points towards him...
and you keep refusing
to even look at it.
I'm not refusing
to look at anything!
I don't think he did it!
Look, you two...
we're up in two days,
and we got dick!
So do your goddamn jobs!
TOMMY: Fuck!
It must've been hard
for you to come here to Chicago.
Didn't know anybody.
No. Nobody.
Didn't have any money?
AARON: No. Nothing.
ARRINGTON: I want to talk more
about your girlfriend Linda now.
Can we, Aaron?
AARON: No.
Why not?
Aaron?
AARON: I'm sor-sor--I'm sorry.
Do--do you think
we could do this later?
No, let's stay with this.
I'm just feeling--
a litt-little tired.
Why does talking about
Linda Forbes upset you?
It, uh, doe--it doesn't.
I just don't--
don't want to talk
about it right now.
Why not?
Are you all right?
No. My head hurts.
OK, OK, I'm sorry.
Let me just fix this.
Hey, you know what I
can do with this thing?
Now, how the fuck
should I know?
Jesus Christ.
Aaron.
What?
Wh-what was you saying?
MAN: Come on.
ALEX: Stop him !
ALEX: What do you want?
I'll kill you!
TOMMY: I don't think so, Alex.
Drop it.
Drop it.
TOMMY: Remember me, huh?
My name is Martin Vail.
ALEX: I don't give a fuck!
You got no right doing this!
I have every fucking right!
I'm Aaron Stampler's attorney,
you little shit!
Now!
What do you know about
the archbishop's murder?
Nothing.
Where the fuck
you think you're going?
No more shit.
Don't fuck with us.
ALEX: I swear, I know nothing!
Then what were you doing
at Aaron's house?
What were you looking for?
A tape.
MARTIN: A tape? Videotape?
Yeah.
MARTIN: Of what?
Sex stuff.
MARTIN: Sex stuff?
What, do I have to draw
a picture for you?
MARTIN: Who?
Who?!
ALEX: Me, Linda.
And Aaron?
Yeah. He shot it, too--
for the archbishop.
MARTIN: Are you telling me
that Archbishop Rushman...
is involved with sex stuff?
ALEX: Yeah. He called it
"purging the devil."
He'd say a sermon
for ten minutes...
and then he'd tell us
what to do.
I don't give a fuck
what you believe!
MARTIN: Hey, hey, hey...
what were you going
to do with the tape?
ALEX: Trash it!
I was going to throw it away.
Just one? One tape?
ALEX: He'd use the same one,
keep recording over and over.
MARTIN: What made you think
Aaron had it?
ALEX: I thought he got it,
went back, and killed him.
He did kill him, right?
No, he didn't.
Where's this girl?
Where's Linda?
She freaked out!
She panicked. She split.
I'm not expecting
any postcards.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Get him the fuck
out of here, Tommy.
ALEX: What? Where to?
TOMMY: Warm bunk
and three meals a day.
ALEX: You can't arrest me.
You're not a cop!
TOMMY: I used to be.
That work for you?
Shit.
OFFICER: Hey, look who's here.
MARTIN: Don't get up.
That's a good article.
OFFICER: You know the rules.
Don't disturb anything.
Don't remove anything.
If you do, it's my ass.
MARTIN: Yeah, mine, too.
I won't touch anything.
Excuse me.
Then preach the gospel
to every--
MARTIN: Hello.
-What are you guys watching?
-Wait a minute.
RUSHMAN: Alex, go to her.
Good.
Now help her.
That's it, Aaron. Good.
Linda, help out.
Good.
Take off her blouse, Aaron.
That's it.
Now, help him, Linda.
Isn't that sweet, Linda?
Good. That's it.
Now take him in your mouth.
TOMMY: Heeere's motive.
RUSHMAN:
Aaron, take her from behind.
Aaron, take her from behind!
MARTIN: Jesus Christ.
Thanks.
MARTIN:
I need to talk to him alone.
ARRINGTON: There's something--
I need to be alone
with my client.
Do you trust me?
Do--Yes.
Yes. Of course I do.
Good, because I don't trust you.
I'll lay it all out for you.
I'm losing this case.
You know why
I'm losing this case?
'Cause my fucking client
is fucking lying to me.
I nev-nev-never--
That's bullshit! That's it.
No more bullshit.
No more games.
Everybody thinks you did this!
Everybody!
I'm the only one who believes
you, and I am that close!
So I want it all out--
all of it, right here.
Did you underline that book?
Hey, hey! Look at me.
Did you underline that book?
N-n-no, I didn't.
I don't believe you.
That is bullshit!
I told--
I don't fucking believe you!
I saw the tape!
I saw the tape.
I know what he did to you.
AARON: No, no, no!
MARTIN: Don't fucking do this.
Tell me the truth.
You fucking killed him,
didn't you?
You're so full of shit!
You did it, didn't you?
Don't lie to me.
You little fuck!
You killed him !
You son of a bitch!
You fucking killed him !
AARON: No! What the hell
you want from me now?
Quit your cryin'! I can't
understand a goddamn word!
You little sissy!
You make me sick!
Well, lookie here.
Who the fuck are you?
MARTIN: Who the fuck are you?
This is my cell, Jack!
Who the fuck are you?
I got you now.
You're the lawyer.
You his lawyer, ain't you?
Yeah, with your fancy suit.
I heard about you.
Well, my, my.
You sure fucked
this one up, counselor!
They're gonna shoot Aaron
so full of poison...
it's gonna come out
his eyes!
Where is Aaron?
Aaron's cryin' off
in some corner somewhere.
You scared him off.
You gotta deal with me now, boy.
I ought to give you
a beatin' on principle!
Look at me.
You come pullin' that tough-guy
shit on Aaron again...
I'll kick your fuckin' ass
to Sunday!
-You understand me?
-I understand you.
MARTIN: Aaron gets in trouble,
he calls you.
You're the man.
Aaron couldn't kick
his own ass.
I mean, you seen him,
with the "Duh-duh-duh."
Jesus Christ.
He can't handle anything.
Sure as shit couldn't handle
all that preacher's blood.
If he'd done like I told him,
we wouldn't be in this mess!
But he got scared and, "Duh."
Ran off and got hisself caught.
Stupid little shit.
MARTIN:
So Aaron did kill Rushman?
Hell, no!
Jesus Christ!
Where'd they find you?
Ain't you been listenin' to me?
Aaron don't have the guts
to do nothin'.
It was me, boy. It was me.
-It was you.
-Yes, it was.
He come cryin' to me
like always...
stutterin' and whinin'--
"l can-can't t-take it
no more, Roy.
"You got--got to help me.
"Please--please, Roy."
I said, "Shut your mouth,
you little girl!
"Grow up. Be a man.
Take care of yourself."
MARTIN: Be a man. Yeah.
So your name is Roy?
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry. Yeah.
What is it, Marty?
Yeah.
Listen, Marty,
I'm dyin' for a smoke.
Do you have a cigarette on you?
MARTIN: No. I quit.
Fuck that.
I can't live without them.
There's gotta be a butt
around somewhere.
Roy, tell me about--
about Linda.
-Linda?
-Yeah.
Who the fuck cares about Linda?
MARTIN: I care.
I'd like to know about Linda.
ROY: That little tramp.
Everybody had a piece of her.
She had Aaron
wrapped up so tight...
he actually thought
she was his girlfriend.
It was pathetic.
She broke his heart.
So that's why you
had to kill Rushman?
Because of the sex stuff?
You seen the tape.
Answer me, you son of a bitch!
Do you think
I'm playin' with you?
I will break your fuckin' neck!
I'll ask you again.
Have you seen that tape?
MARTIN:
Of course I saw the tape.
ROY: Goddamn it!
I told him, "Get the tape!
It's motive, you asshole!"
This is gonna
fuck everything up!
Don't show that
to a goddamn person!
-Do you understand me?
-Yes!
Aaron!
MARTIN: Damn it.
Mis--
Mr. Vail?
Yeah. I'm right here, Aaron.
MARTIN: He did it.
The little fuck did it.
How could I miss that?
Am I going to need stitches?
ARRINGTON: No.
He didn't do it.
Aaron has no idea
what just happened in there.
Kept seeing all the signs--
big ones.
The abusive background,
these repeated blackouts...
the ellipsis in thought,
he's ambidextrous.
I tried to tell you
when you came in.
MARTIN: You may be thrilled,
but I'm fucked.
I don't have a case.
It's textbook
multiple personality disorder.
Put me on the stand.
I'll testify.
He's insane.
I can't--
I can't change plea
in the middle of a trial.
The judge would never allow it.
Besides, insanity's
the hardest thing to prove.
OK.
My professional opinion?
This is not a criminal
we're dealing with.
It's a sick kid.
He's sitting in a cell,
and it's not where he belongs.
Got an aspirin?
Come on, Connerman. Ask it.
Ask what?
The question
you wanted to ask me before.
I--I don't understand,
Mr. Vail.
"How can you defend someone
if you know they did it?"
"How can you do that?"
"How can you fucking defend
these fucking scumbags?"
Isn't that what you
wanted to ask me?
All those coy questions,
all that bullshit.
Bottom line is,
"How can you do what you do?"
You think it's the money,
don't you?
The money's nice.
The money's very, very nice.
The first thing
I ask a new client is...
"You been saving up
for a rainy day?
"Guess what? It's raining."
You think it's because
I want to see my face...
on the cover of magazines?
Fifteen seconds on TV?
I love it.
I fucking love that shit.
I really do.
But guess what?
That's not it.
You go to Las Vegas?
JACK: Yeah.
I don't go to Vegas.
Why do you think I don't?
JACK: Marty, it's late.
I think we should both--
Why gamble with money...
when you can gamble
with people's lives?
That was a joke.
All right, I'll tell you.
I believe in the notion...
that people are innocent
until proven guilty.
I believe in that notion
because I choose to believe...
in the basic goodness
of people.
I choose to believe
that not all crimes...
are committed by bad people...
and I try to understand...
that some
very, very good people...
do some very bad things.
You know, when I was
working for Shaughnessy...
I did something very, very bad.
I mean, illegal.
I was a prosecutor then.
This thing that I did,
it was bad.
I was very upset by it.
Decided I had to leave,
so I left.
I became a defending attorney--
irony being that everyone
assumes I'm lying anyhow.
And I made myself
this little promise--
that, um...
I would reserve my lies
for other than my public life.
You print any of this,
I'll sue your fucking ass.
All right,
so I made a little mistake.
NAOMl: No shit.
MARTIN: You want a new suit?
I'll buy you a new suit.
TOMMY: Made a mistake? You
told us the third man did it.
Now you got your third man.
And a fourth and a fifth.
NAOMl:
What are you gonna do, Marty?
MARTIN: I don't know.
I really fucked up here.
You were right.
NAOMl: So how are you
gonna get him off?
I don't know.
What I know is...
Aaron did not commit
first-degree murder.
TOMMY: He stabbed him
a billion times.
MARTIN: Not Aaron. To convict
someone of a capital crime...
the state must prove intent.
Roy had intent, Aaron didn't.
NAOMl: The only way to prove
that is to change the plea...
which we can't do mid-trial
unless you want a career change.
MARTIN: I could have been
mistaken, but I wasn't wrong.
Aaron is innocent.
It's Roy who is guilty.
TOMMY: This kid needs
an exorcist, not a lawyer.
MARTIN: You're so full of shit.
You didn't see it!
He's one sick motherfucking boy
who's been fucked around...
his whole life by his father,
by his priest.
He does not deserve to die.
It's our job to make sure
a jury believes that.
OK.
How do we do it?
By somehow introducing
this whole abuse thing.
-The tape.
-What about the tape?
NAOMl: That's crazy.
That gives him motive.
MARTIN:
It looks like that, but it's...
No, actually, it turns
this whole thing around.
It gives concrete documentation
of what Rushman did to this kid.
But we can't put it in.
You know that.
But we're not going to.
Oh, fuck.
Ohhh...
OK.
-OK.
-Good.
ANCHOR: ...He also talks about
there were several times...
that things got stormy...
and he would be the one
that would call.
But they never recorded
anything on this...
and they have no record
of violence...
Yeah?
-What the hell are you doing?
-Who is this?
JANET: You know damn well who.
Barleycorn's now.
Janet?
Cute porno.
Part of your collection?
JUKEBOX: Now that I know you...
I've learned to love you...
MARTIN: Hey.
Where'd you get it?
Steal it from the crime scene?
I know nothing
about this tape.
You're such a liar.
If this tape has on it
what you say...
it gives you motive.
You had to. You couldn't
introduce it in court.
The jury would despise you
for dishonoring the bishop.
But if you get me to show it...
motive or no motive,
I'm the one who looks bad...
and you gain sympathy for
your poor little abused boy.
-You think so?
-I hate you.
Don't use it.
I have no intention
of using it.
-Usual, Stu.
-You got it.
You're up to even more
than that, aren't you?
I'm not up to anything.
JANET: You think I'm walking
through that door?
There's a tiger
on the other end.
You know who'd be upset?
Shaughnessy.
-Fuck him.
-Fuck him?
Fuck you.
Thanks a lot.
All right, if this isn't
your motive, what is?
I have motive.
Yeah? What is it?
I'm really going to tell you.
You'd better tell the jury soon.
Time's running out.
WAITRESS: Here you go.
You think you've got me.
You think because you know me
as well as you do...
you know how I think.
Well, I know how you think.
You know what I'm thinking?
What happened to your face?
I--I bumped it
on a medicine cabinet.
No, Marty.
That was a girl on her way out.
Maybe we should
come back here later.
JANET: Later?
They close in ten minutes.
MARTIN: No, after the trial.
When you've got nothing to lose.
How can your timing be
so good in a courtroom...
and so bad in real life?
I'll think about it later.
I hate you too much right now.
WOMAN: You've got a visitor.
YANCY: Well, here she comes.
-Talk to you later.
-OK.
YANCY: Janet.
SHAUGHNESSY: Morning.
So where's the tape?
There's some pretty
ugly stuff on that tape.
Yes, there is.
JANET: Who would have thought?
SHAUGHNESSY:
Where did it come from?
Landed on my front door
last night. No note.
Vail?
-Who else?
-Clever prick.
What do you think he's up to?
I honestly don't know.
SHAUGHNESSY: Cut the crap.
You know him pretty well.
You were balling him,
for Christ's sake.
Where is it?
At home.
I have some advice for you.
If you really have aspirations
beyond this particular office...
pick up that little handbag,
go home right now...
and destroy this tape
you should've destroyed...
Iike I did
the minute you received it.
You don't think Vail has a copy?
You don't think
there's an original?
It's Stampler that's on trial,
not the Catholic church...
and if you haven't found
another motive to hang him on...
then God help you.
BAILIFF: All rise.
Please sit down.
Madam prosecutor.
Ms. Venable.
The state calls Thomas Goodman.
Objection, Your Honor.
The prosecution
knows full well...
that Mr. Goodman
is my investigator in this case.
Under the work product rule, he
can't be compelled to testify.
Permission to approach
the bench, Your Honor?
Granted.
Important evidence has
come into my possession...
which I believe
he can authenticate.
It's Mr. Vail's privilege.
If he doesn't want
Mr. Goodman to testify...
Mr. Goodman doesn't testify.
Make a decision, Mr. Vail.
Mr. Goodman, have you
ever been to my apartment?
TOMMY: Nope.
I mean my apartment building.
Allegedly.
JANET:
I'm sorry. You're confused.
Either you have, or you haven't.
Allegedly doesn't figure.
I have...been there. Yes.
Why did you go there?
TOMMY:
I was delivering something.
For whom?
Martin Vail.
Mr. Vail sent you
to deliver something to me?
-Yes.
-What was it?
A videotape.
Could this have been the tape
you delivered for Mr. Vail?
I have a feeling it is, yes.
JANET: The People place this
in evidence, Your Honor.
So ordered.
Bailiff, please index.
JANET: Where did Mr. Vail
get this tape...
if it is indeed the same one?
TOMMY: He took it from
Archbishop Rushman's closet.
JANET: He stole it?
TOMMY: No, he borrowed it.
Once I transferred it
for him, I returned it.
JANET: Can you describe for me
what's on this tape?
There was a sermon
by Archbishop Rushman--
a rehearsal, I should say--
followed by, um...
a kind of home movie.
JANET: A home movie? Of what?
TOMMY: Some altar boys.
JANET: And?
TOMMY: A girl.
Doing what?
An altar boy lesson
of some kind?
Having sex.
Quiet.
A porno movie?
TOMMY: Mmm...yes.
Yes. Now how is it,
do you think...
that this tape,
this porno tape...
was in the archbishop's
closet...
in order for Mr. Vail
to find it there?
He was the, um--the...director.
Who was?
Archbishop Rushman.
JUDGE: Quiet in the court!
MARTIN:
Everything's going fine.
JANET: And was the defendant
one of the altar boys...
performing in
the archbishop's home movie?
Yes, he was.
JANET: Was his girlfriend?
I believe her name
is Linda Forbes.
Yes, she was.
And did it appear to you
the defendant was enjoying...
performing in this film
with his girlfriend?
No, he does not.
I will not ask if you think
we have uncovered motive.
We will decide that
for ourselves...
once we've
all seen the videotape.
No further questions.
JUDGE:
Does defense wish to cross?
No, Your Honor.
Court's in recess.
Bailiff, set up for the tape.
Mr. Goodman, you're excused.
JANET: Thanks for the advice.
ARRINGTON: Mr. Vail said
she was your girlfriend.
AARON: Y-yes, she was.
ARRINGTON: How'd you meet?
AARON:
We was both at the Savior House.
I was an altar boy...
and she was w-working
for Bishop Rushman.
ARRINGTON: Doing what?
ARRINGTON: Were you sleeping
with anyone else at the time?
No, no.
ARRINGTON: Was she?
AARON: N-n-no--no.
MARTIN: Yeah.
No, I'm still here.
What?
MARTIN: Thank you.
JUDGE: Mr. Vail...
are you prepared to proceed
with your first witness?
Yes, Your Honor.
The defense calls
John Shaughnessy.
Oh, shit.
The People object, Your Honor.
Mr. Shaughnessy's
never been identified--
Your Honor, may I approach?
-Yes, you may.
-Thank you.
MARTIN: My client's on trial
for his life here.
He's always maintained
there was someone else...
in that bedroom.
You think Mr. Shaughnessy
can confirm that?
The U.S. Constitution
takes precedence...
permitting the calling
of any witness...
to promulgate
evidence of innocence.
That's clearly stated
in the Sixth Amendment.
It's also profound
in Brady vs. Maryland.
MARTIN: Mr. Shaughnessy...
you serve on
the board of an organization...
known as
The Rushman Foundation?
I'm privileged to be
an honorary board member.
Explain the nature and purpose
of this foundation.
SHAUGHNESSY: It was founded
by the late archbishop.
Its purpose is to invest
in projects...
for the greater good
of the community.
Greater good
of the community. OK.
Would that be true in the case
of the now bankrupt...
South River
housing development?
Yes.
Tell the court
why the project was abandoned.
SHAUGHNESSY: There was
a difference of opinion...
as to the costs.
MARTIN: Wasn't there also
a difference of opinion...
between the investors and
the late archbishop himself?
-I don't recall.
-Don't recall?
Well...
what kind of money
we talking about here?
How much money,
Mr. Shaughnessy...
was invested in this failed
South River enterprise?
Sixty million dollars.
Sixty million dollars?
Wow, that's a lot of money.
You and the archbishop
have been friends...
for, what, 20 years?
You knew each other really well.
Were you surprised at
the content of that tape...
Ms. Venable submitted?
Of course.
You never heard
any allegations...
charges against him
during that time?
Not that I recall.
Especially since you
were State's Attorney...
for the last 15 years.
You've supervised
all the prosecutions...
in Cook County
during that time...
especially the prosecutions
of all prominent figures.
I also have a thousand
of the best prosecutors.
But as State's Attorney,
you ultimately decided...
who would be indicted
and who wouldn't.
Yes.
All right,
let me just take you back now.
Let's go back to June 1985.
You recall any allegations...
of sexual misconduct against
the archbishop at that time?
I don't recall that.
You recall a young man
named Michael O'Donnell...
who came to the felony
review unit at your office?
I have no idea what
you're talking about, counselor.
It's so confusing.
I have this document here...
from the Chicago
police department...
that says, uh, yes,
"Michael O'Donnell...
"spoke to the unit supervisor
over a period of two weeks...
"explaining to him
in graphic detail...
"sexual abuse he suffered
at the hands of Rushman."
JUDGE: Quiet.
MARTIN: lsn't it also true,
Mr. State's Attorney...
that you then decided your
friend Archbishop Rushman...
was not going to stand trial
for any of it?
He owed you big-time, John.
You must've been pissed off when
he pulled out of South River.
What happened? He just said,
"No! I can't take it"?
You and your investors--
sixty million reasons
to kill him.
You little cocksucker.
JUDGE: Witness dismissed.
Court's in recess.
Vail, in my chambers now.
That's for Joey Pinero,
you little shithead.
YANCY: Start looking for a job.
JUDGE: lf you think
you can use my courtroom...
to wage personal vendettas
and settle old scores...
you are sorely mistaken.
I'm striking Shaughnessy's
testimony from the record...
as irrelevant
and holding you in contempt...
to the tune of $10,000.
MARTIN: So you're telling me...
I can't get a fair trial
in your courtroom?
Be very, very careful.
You're on dangerous ground.
Shall I make that check
out to you?
Shall I take you off this case?
You're making a mockery
of my courtroom...
and I am not going to allow it.
I suggest you start
representing your client...
and stop representing yourself.
AARON: Do this later?
ARRINGTON: No,
let's stay with this a minute.
AARON: I just--
I'm feeling ver-very tired.
ARRINGTON: Yeah, I know.
Why does talking about
Linda Forbes upset you?
AARON:
It d--it doesn't. I just--
ARRINGTON: OK.
AARON: S-sorry, I'm sorry.
ARRINGTON: You know what
I can do with this thing?
How the fuck
should I know?
MARTIN: Dr. Arrington,
how much time have you spent...
with Aaron Stampler?
Around 60 hours.
MARTIN: What did you find
during your evaluation?
ARRINGTON:
I found Mr. Stampler suffers...
from an acute
disassociative condition--
specifically,
multiple personality disorder.
JANET: Objection, Your Honor.
Dr. Arrington's only stating
what she's observed.
JANET: Your Honor?
JUDGE: Counselors.
JANET: Now I know
what you're doing.
JUDGE: Will you
excuse us for a minute?
JANET: lf he wants to question
his client's sanity--
I'm trying to establish
a medical basis for amnesia.
JANET:
No. He's saying he's crazy.
JUDGE: Are you?
No, I am not.
I will allow you to proceed
if you're very, very careful.
Absolutely.
Yes.
JUDGE:
Write down that he said that.
MARTIN:
All right, where were we?
Now, could Aaron Stampler
have been present...
during the murder
of Archbishop Rushman...
and not remember it?
-Yes, he could.
-Could you explain that?
ARRINGTON: His state at that
time was such that his body...
could be present
at a homicide...
yet his mind
would be unable to recall it.
MARTIN:
And how is that possible?
The neurological mechanism
making this possible...
began with the early abuse
suffered from his father.
In defense,
Aaron's psyche splintered...
and helped him to create
two separate personalities.
-Your Honor.
-Mr. Vail.
I didn't say it.
JUDGE: You have been warned.
Do you want to pursue this?
I suggest you think long
and hard before answering.
Your Honor,
just one last question.
All right, Dr. Arrington...
in your opinion...
is Aaron Stampler
capable of murder?
No, he is not.
He's far too traumatized...
to express normal anger
and frustration.
He keeps his emotions
repressed.
Which is why he created Roy,
who is capable of such crimes.
Objection, Your Honor!
JUDGE:
That's enough, Mr. Vail.
The jury will disregard
that last statement...
as will the court.
Madam prosecutor,
do you wish to cross?
You bet I do.
Since you brought it up, against
the court's instructions...
I'm curious to know, is
multiple personality disorder...
your primary area of expertise?
It's not my primary field, no.
Is forensic psychiatry
your primary area of expertise?
No, I'm a neuropsychologist.
I see. So, you have
no forensic experience...
and you're more of,
oh, let's say, an academic.
Then you will forgive
this rather academic question.
I'm driving,
somebody cuts me off.
I think,
"l could just kill that guy."
But I don't, do I?
-I'd hope not.
-That's right.
Things happen to us.
People wrong us.
But we don't all go around
inventing psychopaths...
to do our dirty work
for us, do we?
I'm not suggesting you suffer
from multiple personality.
I'm saying Mr. Stampler does.
Yes, we heard.
You've also testified
that you have met this...
What was his name again?
-Roy.
-Roy what?
He didn't give a last name.
I see.
Did Roy tell you he had
murdered the archbishop?
Mr. Vail was alone
with him at the time.
I was watching
through the window.
But afterwards,
I was in the room...
and saw both Roy and his
transformation back into Aaron.
Did you happen to tape
this appearance of Aaron--
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I just cannot
get used to this name.
ARRINGTON: Roy.
Did you?
No, the tape was off.
Off?
So, you have no record
whatsoever of his appearance.
-No.
-No.
JANET: Does Aaron Stampler
know right from wrong?
Yes, he does.
If he butchered the archbishop,
would he know--
MARTIN: Objection.
If Aaron Stampler
murdered the archbishop...
would he know
he'd broken the law?
Yes, he would,
but Aaron didn't kill--
Oh, yes, I know, Doctor.
It was Roy.
That's all.
No further questions,
Your Honor.
JUDGE: Witness may step down.
If you'd like to reopen
the prosecution's case...
and call
the State's psychiatrist...
I'd certainly agree to it.
No, I don't think
that's necessary.
I think
we all get the picture here.
JUDGE: Mr. Vail,
are you ready to proceed?
Would you like a recess?
Roy?
Aaron.
Could you tell us
a little about...
your relationship
with Archbishop Rushman?
AARON:
He wa-was like a father to me.
I l-loved him very much.
MARTIN: Why did you love him?
-Why?
-Uh-huh.
Well, he s-saved my life...
and he was the only person
that e-ever treated me...
Iike I was worth anything.
Stop your whining, little girl.
Be a man.
MARTIN: We've all seen that
tape that you were in, Aaron.
How did that make you feel?
Did it change your feelings
about Archbishop Rushman?
AARON: N-no. Uh-uh.
He was a w-wonderful man.
MARTIN: You didn't feel anger
towards him...
about being forced to perform
in that tape?
AARON:
No. H-he did everything for me.
There wasn't nothing else
I could do for him...
and h-he needed it.
Do you know someone named Roy?
No. No, I don't.
MARTIN: You heard
Dr. Arrington's testimony...
about what she and I saw there
at the jail.
Some pretty strange things
going on there, you remember?
I heard what she said, but
I don't remember any of that.
-No recollection?
-No, sir.
Did you kill Archbishop Rushman?
AARON: N-no, sir. I did not.
MARTIN: Thank you.
Your witness.
JANET: Mr. Stampler,
would you like some water?
AARON: No. No. No, ma'am.
You sure?
Ye-yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.
Mr. Stampler, did you believe
that the archbishop wore masks?
I'm--I'm sorry.
What did you say?
JANET: Do you think he acted
one way in public...
and another way in private?
AARON: No, I didn't think that.
Wasn't that why you underlined
the Hawthorne passage?
JANET: Mr. Stampler?
No.
I did not underline that book.
JANET: You didn't underline it?
No, ma'am.
And you didn't carve numbers...
referring to that passage
into his chest?
AARON: No, ma'am, I did not.
I t-told you l--
You loved him.
JANET:
You loved him like a father.
Even though he made
you and your girlfriend...
perform demeaning sexual acts
for his own gratification?
No, you don't understand.
H-he--There was no other way...
for him to cast out
his own demons.
-He needed it.
-He needed to get off!
That's what he was doing.
That's what he needed you for--
to perform like a circus animal.
That was your function
in his life.
AARON: No. No.
JANET: Mr. Stampler,
I'm going to ask you straight...
because I am tired...
and I've had all I can take
of this sordidness.
I want to go home
and wash my hands...
and forget all about
you and Archbishop Rushman.
Did the archbishop force you...
and your girlfriend
and others...
to perform sexual acts
while he watched--yes or no?
-No--Yes, he did, but--
-Yes, he forced you.
He forced you...
by threatening expulsion
from Savior House...
and a life on the street with
no heat, no water, and no food.
He put you
in front of a camera...
he made you take off
your clothes...
and you don't think
that's another side...
another face of a man
we thought we knew?
AARON: No!
JANET:
lf someone did that to me...
I'd kill him.
I wouldn't hesitate.
I would stab him
I would chop off his fingers.
I would slash his throat open.
I would carve numbers
into his chest.
I'd gouge out his eyes,
I swear to God.
But that's me.
No further questions,
Your Honor.
-Where the hell are you going?
-Excuse me?
You look at me
when I'm talking to you, bitch!
JUDGE: Mr. Stampler!
ROY:
Fuck you, lady! Come here!
JUDGE: Bailiff! Order!
ROY: You want to play rough?
Let's play rough.
Come on. Back off! Back off!
MARTIN: Roy, take it easy!
ROY: Keep coming, asshole!
I'll break her fucking neck!
MARTIN: Roy, come here.
ROY: Fuck you. I'm walking
out of here real slow.
ROY: No! No!
No! Now, don't you--
No!
-You OK?
-Yeah. I'm OK.
JUDGE: Don't even think
of lighting that cigarette.
JUDGE: How's your neck?
I'll live.
-I could call a doctor.
-Mm-mmm.
JUDGE: Mr. Shaughnessy
just called to inform me...
there will be no mistrial.
As if that was his right.
MARTIN: Can't believe that
scumbag has the balls to call.
No. Thanks.
JUDGE: What matters to me
is what you have to say.
Obviously,
your case has been damaged.
In fairness to the prosecution,
I will declare a mistrial...
regardless of what
Shaughnessy and Vail think...
if that's what you want.
The prosecution doesn't want
to try this case again...
even if it could.
Which it can't,
at least not by me.
And I think
I can guarantee you...
no one
in the D.A.'s Office will, so...
it's up to you.
I'm dismissing the jury
in favor of a bench trial...
and a plea of not guilty
by reason of insanity. Yes?
MARTIN: Yeah.
JUDGE: The defendant
will be remanded to Elgin...
for an evaluation period
of 30 days.
Let them decide the term
of his commitment.
Any problem with that?
JANET: Your honor,
he'll be out in a month.
JUDGE: Take it up
with the legislature.
JUDGE: I'm going home.
MARTIN: Your Honor...
JUDGE: No, I'm not refunding
your contempt fine.
And the next time you want
a client off on insanity...
you plead that way,
or I'll have you disbarred.
You OK?
Am I OK? Do I seem OK?
I get attacked
by this sick twist.
I've lost the case.
I'm out of a job.
No, Marty,
I'm not particularly OK...
but, hey, you won.
Justice was done.
Who the hell cares, right?
Congratulations.
You knew, didn't you?
You knew if I went after him,
he'd wig out up there.
I knew he'd come out
if he was threatened.
And who better to do that
than me?
You used me.
Yeah, I did. I had no choice.
What did I use
that was so terrible?
I knew you'd do your job.
I knew you'd stand up
to Shaughnessy.
I knew you'd try to win
the case.
What's wrong with that?
I lost my fucking job.
You should have left years ago.
JANET: Why do you think
you know what's right for me?
Because I'm arrogant.
I'm very...
very arrogant.
-Want to dance?
-No.
-You sure?
-Yeah.
MARTIN: All you have to do
is turn around.
JANET: No.
JANET: No.
MARTIN:
I have to see my client.
MARTIN:
I'd like a minute alone.
GUARD: Are you sure?
Yeah. I'm sure.
MARTIN: You OK?
AARON: My--my head hurts.
You don't remember
what just happened?
No?
AARON:
No. I lo-lo-lost time again.
Well, I got some good news.
They've agreed to stop
the trial.
They're going
to send you to a hospital.
You can get the help you need.
And there's
a very good chance...
you can get out someday soon.
Yeah.
AARON:
I ca--I can't believe it.
I don--don't know
what to say, Mr. Vail.
MARTIN:
That's all right, Aaron.
I knew the minute
you came into my cell.
I knew everything
was going to be OK.
You sa--You saved my life.
MARTIN: Yeah.
I got to go.
Wh-when will I see you again?
That's up to the courts now.
I don't want you to worry.
I'm going to stay
on top of this, OK?
AARON: Thank you.
All right. You give me a call
if you need to, OK?
-I will.
-All right.
-Hey, Mr. Vail?
-Yeah.
Um, will you t-tell
Ms. Venable I'm sorry?
T-tell her I hope
her neck is--is OK.
MARTIN: Yeah.
MARTIN: What did you just say?
AARON: What?
You told me you don't remember,
that you black out.
So how do you know
about her neck?
AARON: Um...
Well, good for you, Marty.
I was going to let it go.
You was looking so happy
just now...
I was thinking, "Mmm."
But to tell you the truth,
I'm glad you figured it...
'cause I have been
dying to tell you.
I just didn't know
who you'd want to hear it from--
Aaron or Roy or Roy or Aaron.
I'll let you in
on a little secret.
A client/attorney
privilege secret.
MARTIN: Uh-huh.
It don't matter
who you hear it from.
It's the same story.
I--I j-just had to kill Linda,
Mr. Vail.
Th-that cunt
just got what she deserved.
But...
cutting up
that son of a bitch Rushman?
That was just
a fucking work of art.
You're good.
You are really good.
Yeah. I did get caught
though, didn't I?
Mmm.
So there never...
There never was a Roy?
Jesus Christ, Marty.
If that's what you think...
I am disappointed in you,
I don't mind telling you.
There never was...
an Aaron...
counselor.
Come on, Marty, I thought
you had it figured at the end.
Putting me on the stand
was fucking brilliant.
And that whole "Act like a man"?
Jesus, I knew exactly
what you wanted from me...
it was like
we were dancing, Marty.
-Guard.
-Don't be like that, Marty.
We did it, man.
We fucking did it.
We're a great team, you and me.
You think I could have
done this without you?
You're feeling
a little anger here...
because you started
to care about Aaron.
I can understand that, but...
Iove hurts, Marty.
What can I say?
I'm just kidding! I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings!
What else was I supposed to do?
Hey, you'll thank me
down the road...
'cause this is going
to toughen you up, Martin Vail!
You hear me?
That's a promise!
