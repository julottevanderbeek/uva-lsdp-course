Walter, honey.
Time to
wake up.
Just 10 more minutes.
Oh, I'm sorry, sport.
You can sleep in tomorrow.
That's what
Saturdays are for.
Up against the wall.
Come, come, come.
All right.
Got it. Got it.
Look, look!
All right, sit down.
Your breakfast
is getting cold.
It's cereal.
It's supposed to be cold.
Sweetheart, we're here.
Okay.
Here's your books.
Go ahead.
Yes, ma'am. If you hold just a moment,
I'll get a supervisor for you.
SANDY: Yes,
she's coming right now.
Just a second,
she'll be with you.
Just one second, please. You deal
with this one. I'm not going near it.
Hello, this is the supervisor.
How can I help you?
I can see you're
on a party line...
Unfortunately, some people do
listen in on party lines. We...
Well, what is he doing?
Oh, my...
Everything all right?
Yes, sir, it's fine. A lady was
having trouble with the connection.
Hey, sport.
- Hey, Mom.
How was school?
Okay.
- Yeah?
We learned
about dinosaurs.
And I got in a fight
with Billy Mankowski.
What happened?
He hit me.
Did you hit him back?
Good.
Rule number one,
remember?
Never start a fight,
always finish it.
Why'd he hit you?
Because I hit him.
You hit him first?
Why?
He said my dad ran off
because he didn't like me.
Honey, your father
never met you,
so how could he
not like you?
Then why did he leave?
Well, because the day
you were born,
something else
arrived in the mail.
And it was in a box a
little bit bigger than you.
You know what was in it?
Something called
responsibility.
And to some people,
responsibility is the
scariest thing in the world.
So, he ran away because he was
scared of what was in that box?
Uh-huh.
That's just dumb.
That is exactly
what I thought.
Did I miss
I'm afraid so, sport.
Come now, time for bed.
Are we still going
to the movies tomorrow?
CHRISTINE: Uh-huh. I hear there's
a new Charlie Chaplin picture
and a new serial called
WALTER: Who's that?
I don't know.
Nobody does.
That's what makes him
so mysterious.
Oh.
Am I too heavy
for you to carry?
Oh, no,
not for years.
Not for years.
Hello?
Hi, Margaret.
Fine.
Listen, Jean can't come in today
and now we're a little shorthanded.
When did she call in sick?
Well, what about Myrna?
I know she could use
the extra hours and...
No. No, no, no.
I just...
I promised Walter that I'd take
him to the movies, is all, and...
All right.
Just...
Just until 4:00.
I'll see you then.
There's a sandwich
and milk in the fridge,
and I've asked Mrs. Riley
and her daughter
to stop in
in a couple of hours.
I can take care of myself.
I know you can.
They're checking on the house, not you.
Tomorrow we will
go to the movies.
And then we'll ride Big Red to Santa
Monica and take a walk on the pier.
How does that sound?
Does that sound good?
I'll be home
before it gets dark.
I'm not afraid
of the dark.
I'm not afraid
of anything.
I know.
I know.
Be good.
I love you.
We've got lines jammed
from here to Ohio.
He says he needs to speak
to somebody in charge.
I need your signature here
for a supply requisition.
WOMAN 1: Number, please.
WOMAN 2: Number, please.
WOMAN 3: Go ahead, please.
All right, get me
the Omaha routing station.
See if we can put our calls
through their switchers.
Let's get this
console running, now.
Christine. Good, I was
hoping to catch you.
Look, I've been following
your work reports,
and I just want to let you
know that I am very impressed.
When I first suggested
hiring female supervisors,
my superiors weren't
big on the idea.
But you have held your own as well
as any of your male counterparts.
Thank you, Mr. Harris.
Oh, Ben, please.
Listen, I...
Listen, the point is,
we're looking to take on a manager
for our new Beverly Hills office.
And if you're interested in the
job, I could write a report, or...
That would be wonderful.
Thank you so much, sir.
Okay, good,
so maybe we could...
Could we speak about it Monday?
- Yeah, absolutely.
Would that be all right?
Thank you so much, sir. Thank you.
Please!
Please.
Walter.
Honey?
Walter.
Walter!
Honey?
Walter?
Honey!
Walter!
Walter, it's time
to come in, honey.
Suzie?
Have you seen Walter?
No, Mrs. Collins.
Sorry.
Walter?
Walter.
May I please have
the police station?
Hello, my name is
Christine Collins.
I live at 210
North Avenue, 23.
And I'm calling
to report a missing child.
Missing child.
It's my son.
I'm not sure.
I just got home from work.
It could be
since this morning
or it could be
just the last hour.
Yes, of course I did.
No. No, no.
He always stays around the
house when it gets dark.
Would you please send
someone down here?
What?
We don't have the resources to go chasing
every kid who runs off with his pals.
No, no, no.
No, that's not Walter.
He doesn't do that.
With all due respect, ma'am,
every parent who calls says the same thing.
Please, please.
Are you Mrs. Collins?
BRIEGLEB: Our thoughts go out
again today to Mrs. Christine Collins
the work of Police Chief James Davis
and his aptly named Gun Squad.
I understand.
Thank you.
I will call back
in a few weeks.
Thank you very much.
Las Vegas Missing
Persons Department?
Hello, this is
Christine Collins.
I'm calling to see if you've
found any missing or lost children
who meet the description
that matches Walter Collins.
Oh, all right. Well,
please do. Please do call.
And I'll call back
in a matter...
In a week, if that's all right.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
$2.
Hell, I think I left
my wallet at home.
Can I owe it to you?
No credit.
Pay up or I
call the cops.
I'm sick of bums like you
coming around here.
I'm not trying to
stiff you, chief.
I just left my wallet
at home, that's all.
I'll go back and get it.
Five, 10 minutes, tops.
Got collateral?
You can't ask for
better collateral
than a man's own flesh
and blood, right?
Now, you stay here, son.
I'll be right back.
But...
- Now, don't give me any trouble.
He's a good man to
trust us like this.
Now, you just stay here and
I'll go back and get my wallet.
Ten minutes,
then I call the cops.
COOK: Ah, hell.
COOK: Hello, Myrtle?
- Yeah, this is Harve, down at the diner.
Would you get me
Sheriff Larsen?
WOMAN 1: You have
a nice day, too.
Christine, I'm having trouble
with the connection here.
I can't seem
to get through.
I think so.
Yeah, I think that's better.
WOMAN 2: You have a person
to person call, Fairfax 2231.
WOMAN 3: Long distance.
Sorry, can you repeat?
I'll connect you
right away, ma'am.
Thanks.
Mrs. Collins?
Yes.
I'm Captain J.J. Jones,
Lincoln Park Juvenile Division.
My office supervises all
runaway and missing child cases,
including your son's,
and...
He's alive,
Mrs. Collins.
He was picked up two days ago by
local police in DeKalb, Illinois.
He's safe and unhurt.
He was in the company of some
drifter. We have an APB out for him,
but he's safe.
Thank you so much.
SANDY: Oh, Christine...
That is so great.
Thank you.
CHRISTINE: There's
so much press.
Yours is a story with a
happy ending, Mrs. Collins.
People love happy endings.
We better get a move on,
the train's pulling in.
Back, boys. Back.
Thanks.
Thanks, boys, thanks!
I'll have a statement
for you in a few minutes,
but the important
thing right now
is to reunite this
little lady with her son,
so if you'll excuse us.
GUARD: Stay right there.
Come on, don't rush.
Easy, easy.
Mrs. Collins, I'd like to
introduce you to James E. Davis,
Chief of Police.
Very nice to meet you.
We don't get a lot
of positive attention
from the boys in the
press these days,
so it's good to be here with a
positive story, don't you think?
Yes, sir.
I take it you've been treated
well by my boys in the department?
I couldn't file a
report for 24 hours,
and I thought that
maybe that was a...
Technicalities aside.
It was wonderful.
Well, good.
Then you won't have any trouble
telling that to the press,
and the fact that the LAPD...
Women.
Hold on a second.
Back, boys, back.
Keep them back.
Well, aren't you...
Aren't you gonna...
That's not my son.
What?
What are you saying?
It's not my son.
JONES: Well, I'm sure
you're mistaken.
I'm not mistaken.
Well, he's been through
five terrible long months.
He's lost weight,
he's changed.
I would know my own son.
All I'm saying is you're
in shock and he's changed.
What's your name?
Can you tell me your name?
Walter Collins.
It's a common name.
Where do you live, Walter?
You know your home address?
I live at 210 Avenue 23,
Los Angeles, California.
And that's my mommy!
Mrs. Collins, listen
to me. I understand.
You're feeling a little uncertain
right now, and that's to be expected.
A boy this age,
he changes so fast.
We've compensated for that
in our investigation.
And there's no question
that this is your son.
That is not Walter.
It's not Walter
as you remember him.
And that's why it's important for
you to take him home on a trial basis.
A trial basis?
Yes, yes.
Once he's around his
familiar surroundings,
and you've given yourself time to recover
from the shock of his changed condition,
you will see that
this is your Walter.
Now, I promise you, I swear
to you, I give you my word.
This is your son.
Now, if you have any problems, any problems
at all, you come and you talk to me.
I'll take care of it.
I give you my word.
Trust me.
Mrs. Collins, he has
nowhere else to go.
Please.
Maybe I'm not
thinking clearly.
And...
All right.
All right, you're not
thinking clearly, that's right.
MAN: Here we go!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Here, just turn
around here.
How does it feel to have
your son home, Mrs. Collins?
What'd you think when you
saw him for the first time?
It's hard to explain.
JONES: She was
shocked at first.
She didn't recognize the boy,
which is perfectly natural.
He's been through
quite an ordeal.
REPORTER:
How're you feeling, son?
Bet it feels great
to be home.
Yeah. It's great.
DAVIS: The Los Angeles
Police Department is thankful
for all the hard work done by the
DeKalb County Sheriff's Department
in making this joyful
reunion possible.
The LAPD is dedicated to
serving the public at all times.
Can we get a photo with
mother and son, Captain?
Absolutely! Here we are.
Like that.
Like that.
Squeeze together.
There you go, boys.
MAN 1: This way, Walter.
MAN 2: Big smile.
MAN 1: One more, please.
MAN 2: That's a good one.
One more.
The sandwich all right?
Would you like
some more milk?
No.
No, thank you.
No, thank you.
You're covered in soot from the
train. You should take a bath.
Pajamas are on the
edge of the bed.
You okay?
You all right?
I fell. Stupid tub!
That's all right.
You're circumcised.
Get out.
Move.
Last time
I measured Walter,
last time
I measured my son,
he was inches taller
than you are now.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Who are you?
Who are you?
He's not my son.
Mrs. Collins...
No, I don't know why
he's saying that he is,
but he's not Walter
and there's been a mistake.
I thought we agreed to
give him time to adjust.
He's three inches shorter.
I measured him
on the chart.
Well, maybe your
measurements are off.
Look, I'm sure there's a reasonable
explanation for all of this.
He's circumcised.
And Walter isn't.
Mrs. Collins.
Your son was missing
for five months.
For at least part of that time in the
company of an as yet unidentified drifter.
Who knows what such a disturbed
individual might have done?
He could have had him circumcised.
He could have...
Made him shorter?
Why aren't you
listening to me?
I am listening, damn it,
I am listening.
And I understand
your feelings.
He's changed, no
mistake, and that's...
You've both been through
a terrible experience,
and that's why he needs your
love and support to bounce back.
He's not my son!
Why are you doing this,
Mrs. Collins?
Why are you doing this?
You seem perfectly capable
of taking care of the boy.
Your job pays you enough to
attend to his personal needs,
so I don't understand
why you're running away
from your responsibilities
as a mother.
I am not running away
from anything!
Least of all
my responsibilities!
I am even taking care
of that boy right now,
because I am all he has!
What worries me is that you
have stopped looking for my son!
Why should we be looking for
someone we've already found?
Because you have
not found him.
His identity
has been confirmed
by the best minds in the
field of child identification,
people who know
what they're doing.
And I don't?
I'm sorry.
I appreciate everything that
this department has done
and I know
how hard you're working.
I really do, and I don't
want to cause any trouble.
I just...
There has been a terrible mistake,
and I need you to
help me correct it,
so I can find my son
before it's too late.
Please.
I won't take up any more of your time.
I'm sorry I got upset.
I'm sorry, very sorry.
Sara, get Dr. Tarr
on the phone.
Mrs. Collins?
- Yes?
Dr. Earl W. Tarr.
Captain Jones sent me.
I consult with him from time
to time on juvenile cases.
May I come in?
Yes, thank you for coming.
I was beginning to think
he didn't believe me.
Well, I'm here now,
and we'll put all that to rights.
Where's the boy?
Ah! There he is.
A handsome young man.
He has your eyes,
doesn't he?
And a little bit
of the nose.
Very fit, in spite
of all his travails.
A very resilient boy you've
got here, Mrs. Collins.
I thought you were
here to help me.
Well, I am.
Captain Jones said that the boy had
been through some severe physical changes
and asked me
to drop in on him
to reassure you in your
time of motherly concern.
My motherly concern is not for
him because he's not my son.
Now, statements like that will
hardly help the boy's self-esteem,
now will they?
Captain Jones said something
about a change in height?
Yes.
Come.
Against the wall.
CHRISTINE: He's
three inches shorter.
Ah, well...
Hardly a mystery, Mrs. Collins.
We've known for some time that trauma
can affect the growth of children.
Given the stress
of the past five months,
his spine may have
actually shrunk.
It's uncommon, but it's within
the realm of possibility.
And circumcision?
Very likely his abductor
thought it appropriate.
After all, circumcision
is hygienically sound.
Must have been quite
traumatic at the time.
No wonder
he's submerged the memory.
I...
You see, there's a perfectly sound
medical explanation for all of this.
But it's right for you
to raise the questions.
You need to be apprised of all
changes the lad went through
during his absence.
Wouldn't I know whether
or not he's my son?
I'm the mother.
Which means you're in no
position to be objective.
You are looking through the
prism of extreme emotion at a boy
who has changed
from what you remember.
He isn't the same boy
that left here.
Just as a boy that goes
off to war and then returns
is not the same anymore.
And a mother's heart, driven
by intuition and emotion,
sees these changes
and rebels,
insists that
this isn't your son.
Doesn't change the facts.
I'm willing to put my theory to the
test of objectivity, Mrs. Collins.
Are you?
Calm yourself, calm yourself
and just listen to me.
No, no, no.
No, you listen to me, please.
This so called doctor paraded
me around my own neighborhood,
like some kind of a derelict mother
who didn't even know her own son.
He found what he
expected to find,
what you obviously
told him he would find.
- But that's not...
That's nothing
to be embarrassed about.
That I was embarrassed
is not the issue.
The point is that
you are wasting time
when you should be
looking for my son.
But the report is final,
Mrs. Collins.
Well, then I want to receive
the report, so I can refute it,
before it goes
to anyone else.
Fine.
Yes. Good day.
I'm finished. Could I
go to my room now?
Yes.
Good night, Mommy.
Stop saying that!
Stop saying that!
I'm not your mother!
I want my son back.
You're not him.
You're not my son!
I want my son back.
I want my son back!
Damn you!
I want my son back!
I was wrong
to yell at you.
You're just a child
and I don't think you know
what you're doing,
and the hurt
you're causing.
But I need you to understand
that my son is my life.
He's all I have.
And no matter what the police think,
and no matter what the world thinks,
you and I,
we both know the truth,
don't we?
We both know that
you're not Walter.
You just have to tell them
that you're not my son,
so they can find my son.
Please.
We can talk tomorrow.
Hello?
Yes.
My name is Gustav Briegleb.
I'm the pastor over at
St. Paul's Presbyterian.
Oh, yes, I've heard
your broadcasts.
I'm...
Thank you.
No.
Well, maybe you should give it a gander
and then come over here to the parish
for breakfast, in, say, an hour.
I think we should meet.
Hello?
"Mysterious case of...
"Acting on the request of the
Los Angeles Police Department,
"Dr. Earl W. Tarr, child
specialist, examined Walter Collins
"to determine the cause
of his loss of weight,
"paleness, confusion,
and rundown condition
"noticed since the
return of the boy
"to his mother last Monday."
Lovely bit of phrasing,
isn't it?
Noticed since the return
of the boy to his mother.
Now, not only does that clearly
state you're the boy's mother,
but one could infer from it that you're
somehow responsible for these changes.
And that the police
department is concerned
for the boy's welfare
while he's in your charge.
You should try the eggs.
They're very nice.
"'I examined the boy quite
thoroughly,' Dr. Tarr said,
"'And it's clear that
he has something to tell.
"'I'm sure that in time..."'
...time he will give his boyish
story of the entire affair,
but not until he has
faith in his listener.
And that is what is lacking here,
faith in the poor lad's story.
Course of my examination, I found
nothing to dispute the findings
of the LAPD.
Why would they do this?
To avoid admitting
they made a mistake
when they brought
back the wrong boy.
Of course, anyone reading the
newspaper with half a brain
would see
through it instantly.
Sadly, that would exclude about half
the readership of the
Mrs. Collins, I have made it my mission
in life to bring to light all the things
the LAPD wish none
of us ever knew about.
A department ruled by violence, abuse,
murder, corruption and intimidation.
When Chief Davis took over the
force two years ago, he said...
We will hold court against gunmen
in the streets of Los Angeles.
I want them brought
in dead, not alive,
and I will reprimand any officer who
shows the least mercy to a criminal.
He picked 50 of the most
violent cops on the force,
gave them machine guns and permission
to shoot anyone who got in their way.
He called them
the Gun Squad.
No lawyers, no trials, no questions,
no suspensions, no investigations.
Just piles of bodies.
Bodies in the morgues, bodies in the
hospitals, bodies by the side of the road.
And not because the LAPD
wanted to wipe out crime. No.
The LAPD wanted to
wipe out the competition.
Mayor Cryer and half
the force are on the take.
Because once you give people the
freedom to do whatever they want,
as the Lord found in the Garden
of Eden, they will do exactly that.
This police department does not
tolerate dissent, or contradiction,
or even embarrassment.
And you are in a position to
embarrass them and they do not like it.
They will do anything in
their power to discredit you.
I've seen that happen too many
times to start going blind now.
That's why I wanted
to meet you,
to let you know what
you're getting yourself into
and to help you fight it,
if you choose to.
Reverend, I appreciate
everything that you're doing
and everything
that you said,
but I'm not on a mission.
I just want my son home.
Mrs. Collins, a lot
of mothers' sons
have been sacrificed
to expediency around here.
Your son, unfortunately,
would not be the first.
But if you do it right,
he may very well be the last.
He had two cavities
that needed filling.
He put up a fight,
but I took care of it.
And?
Your son's upper front teeth were
separated by a small tissue, a diastema.
It made them sit about
an eighth of an inch apart.
The boy in that room
has no such gap.
Can that change with age? Because
that's what they're gonna say.
In some cases,
yes, it's possible.
But the tissue between Walter's
teeth prevents that from happening.
See, they can never come together
without an operation to sever the tissue,
and I can tell you right now that
he has never had such an operation.
Would you be willing to put
that officially in writing?
Pardon my language,
but hell yes.
Sounds like the
anesthetic's wearing off.
On the other hand, maybe
I'll write that letter first.
Give the little fella
something to think about.
Well, if it is,
he's changed enormously.
Do you know who I am?
You're a teacher.
Yes, but even teachers
have names. What's mine?
I don't remember.
I know you, but I don't
remember your name.
Mrs. Fox.
Now, take your seat.
I didn't say take a seat. I said
take your seat, the one assigned you.
You must know where it is, you've
been sitting in it for over a year now.
Mrs. Collins, if that's your
son, I'll eat my yardstick.
Not only will I put it in writing, I
will testify to it in a court of law
or to the President Calvin
Coolidge himself if I have to.
Thank you.
I'll see you tonight
for the broadcast.
Good luck.
REPORTER 1:
Quick question, ma'am.
REPORTER 2:
Quick question!
REPORTER 3: Mrs. Collins.
Hello. My name is
Christine Collins.
Good morning.
MAN: Good morning.
On March 10th, my nine-year-old
son, Walter Collins, disappeared.
And a five-month investigation
led to a boy being brought to
Los Angeles from DeKalb, Illinois.
They told me and all of you
that this boy was my son.
He was not my son.
The LAPD made a mistake,
and that is the reason for
the supposed transformation.
I have letters from his
teachers and his doctors
all confirming that
he is not my son.
I'm having them reprinted now, and
I'll have them for you tomorrow.
I have given the LAPD every
opportunity to admit their mistake
and renew the
search for my son.
Since they have
refused to do so,
it has forced me
to bring my case public.
And I hope that this now will persuade
them to finish what they started
and bring my son home to me.
Thank you very much.
Morelli!
I want you to find the
Collins woman and get her here.
And, Bill, bring her
in the back way.
Yes, sir.
This way, miss.
Why are we going
in the back?
Captain's orders. Front's
jammed with reporters.
Please, sit down, miss. Captain
Jones'll be right with you.
Hey! Anyone want to take a call
from the Canadian Mounties? Ybarra?
What'd they do,
lose a moose?
They need a juvenile living here
illegally deported back to Canada.
He's living with his cousin on some
ranch near Riverside, in Wineville.
You want it?
- I'll take it.
Got nothing better to do.
You're a prince.
Mrs. Collins.
You can leave the boy.
She'll take care of him.
Sit.
Oh, you've caused us quite a
bit of trouble, Mrs. Collins.
This situation has become an embarrassment
for the entire police department.
It wasn't my intention
to embarrass anyone.
Oh, no, of course not.
You just told the papers we couldn't
tell one boy from another as a compliment
for the months we spent
working on your case.
You trying to make fools out of
us? Is that it? You enjoy this?
Of course not.
I want you to find my son.
You know what your
problem is, Mrs. Collins?
You're trying to shirk your
responsibilities as a mother.
What?
You enjoyed being a
free woman, didn't you?
You enjoyed not having to
worry about a young son.
You could go where you
wanted, do whatever you wanted,
see anyone you wanted.
But then we found your son,
and we brought him back.
And now he's an
inconvenience to you.
And that's why you
cooked up this scheme,
to throw him to the state and get
the state to raise him for you.
Isn't that true?
- That is not true!
No? Well, even the boy
says he's your son.
Why would he say that?
How would he know
to do that?
I don't know.
I just know he's lying.
Oh, maybe so.
Maybe he is a liar.
But that's how he's
been trained, isn't it?
Lying was born
in both of you.
You're a liar and a
troublemaker and, if you ask me,
you got no business walking
the streets of Los Angeles.
Now wait a minute.
Because either
you know you're lying,
or you're not capable of knowing if
you're lying or telling the truth.
So, which is it?
You a derelict mother?
Or just plain nuts?
'Cause from where I sit,
those are the only options.
I'm not gonna sit
here and take this.
You want experts? You want doctors?
I have a few of my own.
Matron.
Mrs. Collins, you still insist that
the boy out there is not your son?
Yes, I do.
Please, don't struggle.
- What?
No!
- You'll only hurt yourself.
What are you doing?
- Hold still.
You can't just do this.
No, you can't.
JONES: You are to
convey the prisoner
to the Los Angeles County General
Hospital Psychopathic Ward.
What?
You are to make
the following entry.
Defendant states she's been
deceived by police and others,
and that we have given
her a boy and tried
to make her think it is her
son when she says it is not.
Take her away.
- No. No, no.
CHRISTINE: Please. Please.
MATRON: Come on,
Mrs. Collins.
CHRISTINE: No. No.
MAN: This way.
JONES: Mrs. Collins has been known
to us since about March 10th, 1928
when she reported her
nine-year-old son, Walter, missing.
MAN: Okay.
She suffers from paranoia, delusions of
persecution and dislocation from reality.
We recommend that she be
conveyed to the psychopathic ward
Got another code 12.
Name?
Collins. Christine.
No, no, no, listen,
this is a mistake.
Certifying officer?
Captain J.J. Jones,
Lincoln Heights Division.
No, no, please!
Please! The police are trying to punish me...
If you keep it up, I'm gonna
have to put you in a straitjacket.
Do you want that?
No, ma'am.
Then behave yourself.
Code 12.
WOMAN: I'm not mad!
Please.
Oh, God.
NURSE: All right.
No!
Stop!
Spread your legs.
What?
Wider.
Oh.
FEMALE PATIENT:
I'm not sick!
Touch me! Touch me!
Inside. This is your room.
The doctor has left for the day.
He will see you in the morning.
Can I... I need to speak
to somebody in authority.
Sorry.
My room!
No. No, no, no, this is my room.
Can I make
a phone call?
Phone privileges are
earned by good behavior.
You're not allowed newspapers,
magazines, radio, books or sharp objects.
This is for your own good.
WOMAN: Help me!
Listen to me.
My room.
No,
this is my room.
WOMAN: Oh, God!
My room.
No, no,
this is my room.
My room.
My room! My room!
My room!
My room!
They said it was my room!
You have a problem?
Overheated, that's all.
She'll be fine in a bit.
Hey, listen, could
you give me a hand?
I'm trying to find a place called
the Northcott Ranch, up by Wineville.
Northcott Ranch, huh?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You're almost there.
You just... You just
follow this road west,
about two, no, three miles.
And then you take
that next right.
And you stay on that and it
will bring you right to it.
Is something going
on out there?
No.
Just looking into
a juvenile matter.
Thanks for your help.
Sure.
Hello?
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Come here!
Come here!
This is the police!
I have a warrant for a
minor named Sanford Clark.
Open the door
or stand aside.
YBARRA: Hey! Stop!
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it or I'll push
your face through this floor!
Stop it!
Fine!
Give me your hands.
Come on.
Sit down.
Jesus!
What the hell is
wrong with you, kid?
Huh?
Don't you know assaulting
a cop is against the law?
What difference
does it make?
We're just sending you
back to Canada, son.
It isn't the end
of the world.
What?
Well, you can't stay in the
U.S. as long as you want, pal.
No word from Mrs. Collins?
We haven't heard from her.
Get on down to her house,
make sure she's all right.
And if she's not there,
check with her neighbors.
Find out what they know.
Absolutely.
RADIO ANNOUNCER: And now KGF
welcomes the Reverend Gustav Briegleb
This is Pastor Gustav A. Briegleb
of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church,
bringing you the Lord's
word on Radio KGF.
Good evening.
I had hoped to have
a guest with us tonight,
but apparently
she has been delayed.
And since she cannot be here to tell you
what she told the press this afternoon,
and I'm going to keep on telling
you every night, right here,
ANNOUNCER: The Desert
Local, train number 45,
Hello. I'd like a
ticket to Canada.
Alberta or Vancouver,
whatever's leaving tonight.
I don't have anything
going that far tonight.
The best I can do is put
you on a train to Seattle.
From there you can transfer to a
local or drive across the border.
That would be fine.
Roundtrip?
One way.
That'll be $15.
Right.
There you go.
Thank you. There you go.
Enjoy your trip.
I will.
Breakfast is half an hour.
Please, miss, I need to
see a doctor in charge.
The dining room
is down the hall.
The doctor will call
for you when he's ready.
NURSE 1: Do you want
eggs or oatmeal?
Okay, that's everyone
that's here.
All right.
You can pull the oatmeal.
NURSE 2: Do you want
it for tomorrow?
NURSE 1: You know, just dump it.
NURSE 2: All right.
You should eat.
Eating is normal.
You gotta do everything
you can to look normal.
It's the only chance
you got.
WOMAN: I'm not hungry.
MAN: Barbara, you have to eat now.
- I'm not hungry.
My name's Carol Dexter.
What's yours?
Christine.
Christine Collins.
Now, finish it all. I know
it's hard, but you gotta try.
WOMAN: Oh, boy.
I heard them talking.
You're here on code 12?
Police action.
I mean, the doctors,
the staff, they figure
that if the police
brought you here,
there must be
a good reason for it.
There isn't a good
reason for it.
I'm perfectly sane and I
will explain that to them.
How?
The more you try to act sane,
the crazier you start to look.
If you smile too much, you're
delusional or you're stifling hysteria.
And if you don't smile,
you're depressed.
If you remain neutral, you're emotionally
withdrawn, potentially catatonic.
You've given this
a lot of thought.
Yeah, I have.
Don't you get it?
You're a code 12,
so am I.
We're here for the
exact same reasons.
We both pissed
off the cops.
Now, you see, you
see that lady there?
She was married to a cop
who kept beating her up.
When she tried to tell somebody
about it, he brought her here.
WOMAN: I want more juice.
And that one?
NURSE 3: Put your tray
back where it belongs.
The police beat the crap out of
her brother, broke both his arms.
When she tried to
tell the papers...
And you?
I work nights.
WOMAN: Sure.
I mean, I work nights.
Oh.
Yeah. In the clubs.
Downtown.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, this one client just
kept hitting me and he wouldn't stop,
so I filed a complaint.
And it turns out
he was a cop.
Next thing I know,
I'm here.
But they can't do that.
Are you kidding?
NURSE 3: All right, one
more and then that's it.
Everybody knows
women are fragile.
I mean, they're all emotions, no logic,
there's nothing going on upstairs.
PATIENT:
Somebody! Help me!
Every once in a while they say
something that's a little inconvenient,
they just go fucking nuts.
Pardon my French.
NURSE 1: You gotta get those dishes.
NURSE 2: You got it.
If we're insane, nobody
has to listen to us.
I mean, who are
you gonna believe,
some crazy woman trying to
destroy the integrity of the force,
or a police officer?
Then once they get us in here, we
either shut up and we learn to behave,
or we don't go home.
MAN: Are you all done?
Or we go home like that.
Stop. Stop it.
Stop it!
Stop it.
Please.
Clark.
Sanford Clark?
Here.
Paperwork's come through.
You'll be deported back to
Canada day after tomorrow.
Police there will decide
what to do with you next.
I hope your stay here has convinced
you not to try crossing the border
illegally in the future.
Wait!
I'd like to talk to the
officer who brought me in.
I'm sure he has far
more important things...
Please. It's important.
NURSE: Christine Collins.
Thank you. Mrs. Collins.
Dr. Jonathan Steele.
Please, have a seat.
I hope your stay with us
has been comfortable so far.
Yes.
Really?
I'd think it'd
be quite difficult at first.
Yes, it was.
Of course it was very difficult,
but comfortable enough.
I see that they have...
They've taken a blood test.
The Wassermman Test.
They said it was to check for
syphilis, 'cause it affects the mind.
The idea that someone thinks you
need to be checked for syphilis,
does that upset you?
No, they said it was standard
procedure, so it did not.
Yes, exactly.
Standard procedure.
We have to cover
all our bases.
I can imagine
that for some people that
would be uncomfortable,
but I understood.
According to your file you
believe that the police substituted
a fake boy for your son.
No, I didn't say
he was a fake boy.
He's not my boy.
They brought home
the wrong boy.
My son is still missing.
Well, that's strange, because
I have here a newspaper article
with a photo of you at the train
station, welcoming home your son.
That is you in the
photo, isn't it?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
So, at first
he was your son,
and now he's not your son.
Has this
been going on for a long time?
People changing, becoming
something other than what they are?
People don't change.
You don't think
people change?
No, that's not...
The police, they're not
out to persecute you?
No, they're not.
No, they're not.
The police are here
to protect you.
Yes.
Really?
Yes.
Well, that's odd because
when you were admitted,
you told the head nurse that the police
were conspiring deliberately to punish you.
So, either the head nurse and the
interns are also conspiring to punish you
or you're changing
your story.
Do you often have trouble telling
reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins?
No.
I'm sorry to bring you out
in this weather, Detective,
but the boy has
been quite insistent.
It's all right.
I'll see what he has to say
so I can go home and get dry.
It's raining cats, dogs,
and Democrats out there,
so this had better
be worth it.
You again, huh?
We'll see.
Well?
This isn't easy, okay?
Yeah?
Driving my ass here in the
pouring rain wasn't easy either.
My cousin is
Gordon Northcott.
He owns the ranch
where you found me.
He said I could live there in exchange
I watch the place when he's gone,
doing chores
and stuff like that.
Said I could stay as
long as I wanted to.
I thought that meant I could
leave whenever I wanted.
Mmm.
You saying that he
held you prisoner?
Bull.
When I got there, you were
running around free as a jaybird.
Could've left any
time you wanted.
No.
So, what's this, huh?
Some kind of story to cover why
you're in the country illegally?
No, it's nothing like that.
'Cause I don't have
time for this, okay?
Listen to me!
He said...
What?
What did he say?
He said that if I tried
to leave, he'd kill me.
Look, you don't understand
what he's like,
what he... What we did,
what he made me do.
All right.
Let's start at
the beginning then.
What'd he make you do?
We killed some kids.
What?
Look, I didn't mean to, I swear.
He made me help him.
He said if I didn't,
he'd kill me, too.
Look, you gotta help me,
please. I'm so scared.
I don't want to go
to hell for killing kids.
Look.
What kids? What... What
are you talking about?
I don't know.
I never knew their names.
Names?
How many?
How many kids?
All together?
About 20, I guess.
No, you're lying.
No! It's true, I swear!
You're gonna tell me
you killed 20 kids?
Yeah! Thereabouts.
I stopped counting
after a while.
Gordon said maybe one
or two may have escaped.
But...
No.
Nobody can just up
and kill 20 kids, okay?
We did.
We did.
How?
Most times we'd just
have one or two.
Sometimes as many as three.
We'd always go a different
direction every time.
Never hit the same
part of town twice.
GORDON:
Well, there you are!
We've been looking
for you like mad.
You have?
Sure thing.
Listen, your folks,
they've been in an accident.
And they sent us to come find
you. Now, they're hurt real bad.
The police took them to the hospital, but
they didn't have time to come find you,
so we said that
we would do it.
Now, come on.
All right.
Get in here. Hurry.
Listen, we gotta get you to that
hospital so you can see your folks.
SANFORD: See, a lot of kids won't
get in a car alone with a stranger,
There's a good boy.
Scoot over.
Scoot over, San.
I want you to hold on tight.
We've got a long way to go.
And we are gonna fly.
I will be, too. "
Every time they got
in the truck,
I just wanted to die.
As soon as we got back to the
ranch, they went in the coop.
You boys hungry?
Huh?
Watch the door, Sanford!
Hey! Watch the door!
What's the matter?
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Are you worried that
I'm gonna hurt you?
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Huh? Come here.
BOY: No! No! No! No! Please!
- I would never hurt you.
SANFORD: Some days
he'd do them right off.
Other days he'd wait,
pick up a few more,
until he had about
four or five of them.
Yeah.
BOY: No! No! No!
GORDON: No what?
No what, huh?
Come on. Come on. Come on!
Sanford, keep your
eye on that door!
BOYS: No! Please, no! No! No!
No! No! No! No!
Please! No! No!
He'd... He'd
sometimes leave
just one or two of them
alive, barely, anyway.
He'd say,
"Finish them, San.
"Finish them or... Finish
them or I'll finish you."
And I did.
And I killed them.
And I did.
I killed them.
Oh, God, I killed them!
Oh, God! Oh!
Hey.
Hey.
What?
Look at me.
These kids.
You think if you saw them again, you
think you might be able to recognize them?
I don't know.
Maybe.
