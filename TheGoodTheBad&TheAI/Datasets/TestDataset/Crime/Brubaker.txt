What is it?
Got some rabbit in him.
Carry him on.
Those guys with the guns?
Convicts.
What the hell you talking about?
Wakefield prisoners, baby.
Same as us.
He's not going to make it.
Take these boys on back.
One of you cons trying for parole?
Come on. Up, up.
You guys hit bottom.
Here you go.
In there.
Follow me.
In there.
That's it for you.
OK, next man.
Take a little off
around the ears.
No haircut costs five, Zaranska.
Two only gets a crew cut.
I'll tell you when. You!
Fuck, I could use this on a bed.
It'll all come off then.
Maybe an ear with it.
What happened to that guy on the bus?
Don't talk to me
unless I tell you to.
You hear?
Yeah.
What's it be, my man?
Leave the ears.
I'm getting ready to come on in.
Fresh meat coming in.
Where in the hell's Lemar at?
He don't have the job no more?
I'm the man in here.
I'll show you
where you're sleeping.
Rest of you find
some room on the foor.
We talk about beds...
when somebody gets out or dies.
Come on.
Let's get down here.
Come on over here.
Every other one.
Come on down here.
Let's go.
What are you looking at?
Move on down there.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, move it down.
Move it on down.
Fucking shower.
Can't get a shower
to save my fucking life.
Let me go!
Aah!
You all right, buddy.
You all right.
?? Dom do do do do??
?? Mm mm mm mm mm??
?? Dom do do do do do??
?? De de do do??
?? De de de de do??
?? Dom do do do do??
?? Do do do do do??
?? Dom do do do do????
Come on, boy.
Are you playing hard to get?
No!
God!
Ah!
Oh! Oh!
Get your own soap!
Ha ha ha!
Mr. Caldwell.
Lord, you getting fat,
aren't you?
Stay out of my face,
motherfucker.
Hey, Huey.
Morning.
How about that game?
I'm getting ready
to be angry, Abraham.
I'm getting ready
to be real angry.
Oh, look at her go.!
She gets up
along the inside.
She's still behind her.
Look out.!
She throws a left hand.
Trying to knock
the bigger gal offher feet.
Belts her again.!
And she goes down.!
Some new people
came in today.
They need to go to school...
so show them what the picture is.
When this is over.
Now, Eddie.
Where's my boots?
Walter.
Coming in, Otis.
I ain't ridin' the hide, Otis.
Hey, I told you
I ain't have no match, man!
Bobby, they want you
down at the bars, boy.
Down at the bars,
Captain?
Move.
Bars, Captain?
Goddamn it!
I said move!
I ain't got all fuckin' night!
Where's the bars, Captain?
I didn't do nothing, Captain.
I didn't do nothing.
Aah!
Drop them pants
and get on that gate.
But I didn't do nothing.
I didn't do nothing.
Uh!
Uh!
Ah!
Is that one or two?
Three.
Three what?
Three, Captain!
Four, Captain!
Five, Captain!
Six, Captain!
Seven, Captain!
Eight, Captain!
Nine, Captain!
Aah!
Pick him up.
What the hell
you looking at?
Pick it up!
Pick it up! Pick it up!
Move it out!
Move out!
Let's see you swing them hoes!
All right, you boys,
swing them hoes!
I'm getting it clean.
You coming down to
the office, Captain Renfro?
I wrote them letters
like you wanted.
You want to look at them?
What about my brother?
I'll send 10 boys over...
to wash out
his milk machine on Tuesday.
Get yourself cleaned up, boy.
Hey, baby.
Coming to see me tonight?
I think he's blushing.
Why, you...
Beat him up.
Sucker, you in trouble,
you know that?
Beat him up,J.B.
What's going on there?
Boys!
Elwood!
Over here.
Come on.
You're fixing to get over
to Camp Five.
You're the dumbest asshole yet!
Put him down on the ground.
Now put the gun on him.
Hold him down.
I'm doing, Birdwell.
Ya'll look here now.
Aah! Aah!
Shut up!
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
All right. That's it.
We got a long night together...
and I don't want to hear
nothing but snoring.
You can't win 'em all.
No, I'll give you
another shot at it.
We'll see you later.
My hospital calls,
you ain't seen me.
Sure, Doc.
What about him?
I'll see him next week.
Want me to do anything to him?
I'll take care of you
in a minute.
No, sign says four today for blood.
Yeah? Don't believe
everything you read, Zaranska.
Give me a sandwich, man.
Man, I know what it is.
Give me a sandwich, buddy.
Sandwich.
Fresh out this morning.
Why don't you look around?
Are you finished
with that, Mr. Caldwell?
Two bits.
What?
Sold.
You just cost me 50 cents...
that was needed elsewhere.
Go ahead. It's protein.
No, don't! Stop it!
No! Come on! Wait!
No! Please!
Don't! Stop it!
Let me go!
No!
No!
Let me go! Stop it!
Hey, Rob!
Where are you going
with those boys?
I need this stuff
started today.
My insurance company
wants an inventory.
Mr. Woodward,
I gave you 20 people...
and I'm down on my count.
I don't care
other people's problems.
All right.
I got you a nice
sirloin tip there.
Warden Renfro's
going to hear direct...
you don't come through for me.
Don't you worry.
This one, up.
Let's go.
Hey, I'll take it.
Thanks, man.
Hey, I do that.
I do that.
Where's my meat?
It's coming in back there.
You told me two steers.
That ain't two steers.
I couldn't do it
this week, Pink.
Suppose I couldn't spare beer?
I'll make it up to you, all right?
Where's Carol at?
Back at the house.
Back to the truck.
I'll give you
the name of the stoolie.
Give me back my dough.
Who told you to ask me?
The pin boy
in the bowling alley.
Who said to ask him?
The fella at the auction shop.
Oh, shit!
Wash your mouth out.
Ha ha ha!
What time are you
coming up there tonight?
My brother's got me working.
No, he doesn't.
I just bought you the night off.
What the hell you doing?
Move them logs.
You move them, asshole.
You're asking for it, boy.
Floyd!
Yeah, Huey?
You got them taking a nap, Floyd?
Get back to work!
Huey, don't get excited.
Take it easy, now.
Floyd, shut up, man.
Peanuts just went up to six bits.
They want you up at the bars, Bullen.
Who wants the last
peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
Half a rock. Who wants it?
You got yourself a phone call.
Aw, fuck!
Look here, Eddie.
Eddie, why a phone call?
Let's go, Bullen.
Why a fucking phone call?
Hey.
What's with the phone call?
I'm getting ready to say
something important now.
I want to know
I'm being listened to.
I'm getting ready to
give out the detail.
Leonard, the kitchen.
Collins, slaughterhouse.
Sanitation detail.
You, too, Bullen.
This man is hurting...
You just deal with colored.
I'll handle the white folks.
Besides, I don't think
Bullen's got much more...
than refried shit
for brains this morning.
What about your boy, Boyd,
for clerical?
Come on, come on.
We ain't got all day.
Hey!
I got this honky here!
I'll rip this cat's head off.
You get me the man! Now!
I can hear his neck snapping.
I want some respect!
You hear me?
I want some respect!
We hear you, Walter.
Get me the man!
I hear his neck snapping.
Open this.
You want in?
Yeah.
Some fucking respect around here.
?? R-E-S-P-E-C-T??
?? Find out what it means to me??
?? What you want??
?? A little respect??
?? What you need??
?? A little respect??
?? All I'm asking??
?? For a little respect
when you come home??
?? Baby, when you
come home????
Hey!
Can we talk?
Who the fuck are you?
I want the man!
I am the man.
I'm the new warden here.
My name is Henry Brubaker.
Don't be fucking with my head.
New warden, my ass!
It's true.
You look like a scumbag.
I'm fooling those guys out there.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
When are you going
to paint this place?
What color?
Yellow, yellow.
Yellow.
I want a picture window
in my place.
This yours? This one?
And one of them
high-low pinto shag rugs...
and some liquor and a TV...
like them fucking
trusties all got.
And some fresh air.
Which wall?
Which wall, what?
The window.
The picture window.
Come on.
Show me exactly.
Maybe I want a skylight.
Yeah, I want...
I want a skylight.
Aah! Aah!
How you doing?
Open this. Open it up!
Get this man
some medical attention.
Get this place painted.
What color?
Any fucking color he wants.
Everybody crazy around here.
My office.
Mess with me now,
you'll regret it later.
We don't work this thing out...
you won't be around later.
I can make
that tower guard blow you out.
Or you can continue
walking with me...
like the smart escort
I figure you to be.
Hey!
Hold it!
I'm replacing you.
Coombes, give me a hand.
Call the governor.
Who is this asshole?
I don't know.
The name's Brubaker.
He thinks he's the new warden.
That's the way it is.
What is? What is, hmm?
You're Willets, Earl?
Burl.
Burl, right.
State employee, purchasing agent.
You've been here, uh...
uh... three years next May.
Five years in July.
Government service ranking
is seven.
You're due for
an in-grade raise in May?
Yes, sir.
That part's all true.
Captain, this is
a hell of a note.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll make sure
all your magazines get forwarded.
Don't worry.
Mr. Brubaker,
the smartest thing you ever done...
was come in here incognizant.
The dumbest was stepping forward.
You want it, you got it.
Bye.
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me?
The name is Henry Brubaker.
I'm what the governor
promised... a reform warden.
That sneaks in like
James fucking Bond.
All right. Yeah!
Purcell, give me that.
See this?
This thing is gone.
Any trusty who wants
to go back to raking rocks...
just get caught using this
on one of your charges.
If an inmate attempts an escape...
do we wave so long?
Shoot him.
What?
Shoot him.
Wound him if you can.
Nobody is getting paroled anymore...
for trying to kill
escaping inmates.
Let's get something straight.
I figure most of you guys
belong here.
You don't have any respect
for other people or yourselves.
You want more from me,
you'll have to earn it.
We'll make this run
like a 20th-century farm.
You'll stop selling blood
to buy decent food.
You'll go out
and plant vegetables.
Why you got your bubbles on?
Women can't come in here.
It's all right, Ruben.
I don't want 15-hour shifts.
The beef raised here on this farm...
will be eaten by everyone.
What the...
Son of a bitch.
He was an army lieutenant.
He ran a military stockade.
Uh, to enforce...
This is ridiculous.
He taught penology
at Price University...
How old are you?
To enforce state laws.
This is ridiculous.
It's "to enforce the laws..."
We've got angry...
...prison without taking
a loyalty oath.
To enforce state laws.
Enforce state laws.
To be respectful
to my superiors.
To be respectful
to my superiors.
And to faithfully perform
the duties of this office.
No publicity on this.
People are on your side.
It's strong stuff.
I mean it... no publicity.
I quite agree.
To be loyal to...
I can't be kept in the dark...
on something like this.
Chairman of the prison board
is expected to approve...
everything
pertaining to the prison.
I hope you won't scream
for free-world guards.
How long have you been on
the prison board?
Print it.
What do you think
of our new warden?
I wonder what his first order
of business will be.
Blow the place up.
Start from scratch.
You're making a joke, of course.
Of course.
Oh, yes.
Learn much?
Not enough.
I've never seen anything like this.
There isn't anything like this.
The problem isn't
just inside the prison.
That's why I have to move fast.
Carefully.
Same thing, Lillian.
Henry, this is very important.
No kidding.
You're one of the strangest
individuals I've ever seen.
I've got an 11:00.
What's the problem?
She said you're
the most punctual individual...
she's ever known.
I'll call you later.
I know you will.
Man, this is pathetic.
That's it, Purcell.
That's all I've got.
Well, you're out of luck.
I need a desk job, like you.
Anyway, you's overworked.
It ain't up to me.
Purcell, can I see you a minute?
Yeah.
I got this...
I love what you did
with Deach out there.
A lot of people
will like that.
Who was that lady,
by the way?
The day I came in...
trusties put a man on...
gunshot wound.
Uh-huh.
Is he OK?
What do you mean?
I mean, is he OK?
Is he back in the barracks?
I imagine he's at
the county hospital...
don't you?
Find out.
And could you get me...
a dozen pair of sunglasses, please?
All right.
You want them polarized or tinted?
You want the kind
with the little mirrors?
People can't see in.
Makes them nervous as hell.
Just the regular glasses.
You got 'em.
Look, Captain, uh...
Don't call me Captain.
Mr. Brubaker...
I know you're,
uh... probably getting ready...
to make some new
job assignments around here.
You'll probably even name...
your own warden's clerk.
I'd like to, uh...
make a case for myself.
Uh...
Ha ha.
I know I'm not
the smartest guy in the world...
but I do know this job.
And I know this damn place...
better than any man here,
and that's a fact.
I've been the warden's clerk
for eight years.
I know it.
What you got here, mainly...
are rural people...
you know what I mean?
They're not much at paperwork.
No sophistication.
They...
I'm not trying to
put anybody down.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm just telling you
the way it is.
What are you in for, Purcell?
Nothing, really. L...
Nothing?
I held up a card game.
Ha ha.
Pretty stupid, huh?
Undoubtedly they were cheating you?
Absolutely.
That's a fact.
Anyway, uh...
you need something,
I'm your man, OK?
Well, just the sunglasses for now.
You got 'em.
They all for you?
None for me.
Got you.
What are you going to do
about my parakeet?
Abraham, come on.
Tell your story walking.
Yeah, I know.
Your poor bird.
Roy, Roy.
Do I get the desk job?
I got a desk job for you.
Spell ophthalmology.
Say what?
Jesus.
Come on. Come on.
Let these men out daily,
not every six months.
All right, sir.
Purcell, I want to see
Bullen tonight.
Now let's look at look
at that boiler.
You say come in?
I don't like being here.
Looks like
I'm sucking up to the man.
You know what I mean?
You're a lifer.
Habitual criminal.
Big bitch.
Don't get on my bad side.
Word is that I'm dangerous.
How about setting
that weapon aside?
How about you
take off them glasses?
It says here they put you away
for breaking a toilet.
Says you quit school
in the third grade.
I ain't never quit nothin'.
Born in Louisiana...
twin brother run over
by a train at 15...
while trying to escape
a reformatory.
They shot Hollis
and laid him on the tracks...
so the train would squash him...
and make it look like an accident.
Kind of soured me, you know?
I got away...
got arrested for stealing...
a '65 Pontiac sedan.
I got two years for that...
and I done them.
I got arrested for stealing...
a '69 Pontiac convertible.
You big on Pontiacs?
Bone white...
leather oxblood upholstery...
big, huge chrome fender skirts.
How do they compare?
They fucked up
the engine in '69...
if you ask me.
I got three years for that.
Another felony.
Then come the toilet.
I got picked up
for vagrancy... misdemeanor.
The next morning,
the toilet's broken.
There's six men in the cell...
and they stick me with it.
Felony number three... habitual.
That judge gives you life
for a toilet.
Yeah, or give me
the toilet for life.
Now I'm shoveling shit
for dead men.
Instead, how would you
like to be a trusty...
and run my motor pool?
Ahem.
Mr. Brubaker,
I've been studying you...
since you first come in...
and it's come clear to me...
that you are one weird
fucking individual.
I ain't got you
figured out yet...
whether you're good or bad.
Does that mean you'll
run my motor pool?
Wear them khakis...
and get me a guitar...
be the warden's new boy?
No. You're smarter than that.
The whole world's
fucked up, Mr. Brubaker.
Yeah.
It ain't no use.
Tower number three.
Who am I looking at?
He's looking at me.
Up there, you got
Douglas Mizell.
Who's Doug Mizell?
He's a forger.
Three times grand theft.
I want a run-down on everybody...
that's got tower duty.
That's Purcell's job, sir.
l...
I want only murderers up there...
one-time impulse killers.
Aren't you taking
kind of a chance doing that?
It's the habituals
you can't trust.
Most murderers already have it
out of their system.
Guys like you, right?
Ha ha ha.
There's nobody
around here like me.
Oh.
On death row, why'd you let me go?
You tell me.
You're the man.
You're trying to cover
yourself both ways.
You're in for murder, aren't you?
I thought you asked me
to come here so you...
All this good land,
acreage, livestock...
and everybody is starving.
Except guys like you.
Did you eat?
I don't eat that shit
you eating.
Oh. Know a lot
about nutrition?
I know about hungry.
You like being a trusty?
Better than being a rank man.
I'll bet you've seen
a lot of reform wardens.
Every one was a reform warden.
Not Renfro.
Not Renfro?
Uh-uh.
Where did the rank men's
clothes come from?
Think we got a special
factory that makes rags?
Renfro got those brand-new...
just like the ones you're bringing in.
They'll be the same rags...
the next reform warden throws out.
Let me ask you about
being a trusty.
When you're
out in the fields...
holding your gun...
holding all the cards...
what keeps you from taking off?
Uh, Mr. Brubaker, sir...
I wouldn't be putting these ideas...
in nobody's head.
One day, we could
lay down our shovels...
and our guns...
and stop playing the man's game...
pick up and run off.
Hello. Brubaker.
Yeah.
Hang on.
Coombes?
Coombes?
Yeah?
For you.
Yeah?
What?
How many hurt?
What about security?
OK, I'll be right there.
What's... What's wrong?
The rank barracks roof
just caved in.
Get back to your bunks!
You're taking a chance
going in there...
you know that?
Somebody kill the current!
Aah!
Get it off of me!
Give me a hand!
Give me a hand, Coombes!
Come on!
Get them out!
Go back!
There you go.
Holy Christ,
they're digging through there.
Get these men out of here!
Are you going
to put them in your house?
What do you mean,
call the state hospital?
You're 20 miles closer.
It's raining
like hell outside!
I've got one station wagon.
I can't put them in open trucks.
What?
Listen. These are injured men.
Don't lay down.
Give me your hand.
Put pressure on it.
An hour?
Why?
Why?
I'm counting on that.
Two ambulances.
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks a lot.
We've got a bleeder!
Got to get this man to a hospital!
They all need a hospital.
I can't afford no more.
Shut up!
What did he say?
Nothing.
I can't afford no more!
Shut up!
What's going on here?
Nothing.
What's wrong with you?
You're charging for
medical attention?
Who?
You!
Why are you so excited?
We've been charging for years.
Get your hands off me!
You call yourself a doctor?
Get your... Crazy man!
You're a crazy man!
Crazy fool!
Zaranska, this is
your hospital now.
What? Hell, l...
Until we can get a real doctor.
I don't know shit
about hospitaling.
You know more than I do.
Work with me.
Looking good, Warden.
Willets...
you just took delivery...
on 300 cases
of chili last week.
Where are they now?
No. I just looked in the locker.
The boys gobble it up?
Not the rank men.
There's only 50 trusties.
That comes to 7,200 cans...
divided by 50 trusties.
That comes to 144 cans.
You correct me if I'm wrong.
You're going too fast for me.
Divided by seven days...
that comes to
per trusty per day.
Does that tell you anything?
Willets?
Are you alive, Willets?
No, sir.
The roof just fell in.
People are starving.
Where's all the food
going around here?
Purcell.
Sir?
Regulation outfits from now on...
or prison-issue pants,
boots, and shirts.
We don't have any boots.
Well, order them.
That's Willets' area...
acquisition.
No, you order them.
I need about 700 pairs...
and no more shaved heads!
Yeah. But sizes!
You know that.
Yes. I'll be ready.
God damn, look at you...
new blood.
That's what this place needs.
You're Brubaker, right?
Right.
You don't look like no warden.
Chocolate prune cake in there.
My missus baked it up
special for you.
I hate prunes.
They cloud my mind.
Did I say my name?
No. But I know you.
C.P. Woodward.
Call me Woody.
Can I help you?
Roof.
What?
I came about the roof.
Purcell said you'd declared...
a state of emergency or something.
I thought you just sell lumber.
I sell it, I grow it.
I got wood in my veins.
Just give me yourJohn Hancock.
We'll fix things up tight.
No. Hold it, now.
Shouldn't you see
the roof first?
Whatever we find, we'll fix.
You get one pinprick hole
in that tarpaper from the factory...
This isn't a question of pinpricks.
You built that thing wrong...
and I want you to rebuild it.
Of course you do.
I'll help with the cost.
I'll bill only my materials.
This won't cost me anything.
You guarantee your work?
Of course.
You get on top
of this shit pile...
and then the job's
not such a ballbuster.
You'll be happier then.
I'm not complaining.
Are you unhappy?
It sure sounds like it to me.
I'm not in this business for my health.
Or anybody else's.
I'm doing my inventory.
It's a pain in the ass.
Ain't been anybody from Wakefield
helping me lately.
We're not sending
convicts to you anymore.
That's slave labor.
It is not.
You got it all backwards...
because this is a community.
The people around here...
don't ostracize this prison.
We accept it.
We cooperate.
It's a two-way street.
You'll see a lot of nice things...
from people in
the farm supply business...
clothing business...
Lumber business.
Yeah. Take that cake.
The point ain't whether
you like prune.
It's the thought that counts.
Exactly.
Just accept the stuff,
keep your mouth shut...
and let things run...
like they've been
going for 100 years...
before we was born.
I'm talking about tradition.
Don't fuck with tradition.
Count your own woodpile, Woody.
I'll fix my own roof.
A lot of people will be
disappointed in you.
It won't be the first time.
I hope you're right.
Take this.
Get me all the contracts on that roof.
I want everything.
Whose team you on?
What can I say?
He's the coach.
Short season.
Oh, no, it's no secret.
They write it all down.
Prison lumber and labor...
is building people's swimming pools.
That's right.
My trusty is loading our food
into state police cars.
It runs that deep?
We're stepping on more toes
than I imagined.
What's that?
I'm just warning you...
because you're likely
to start hearing things.
I'll be ready to run
interference for you.
I'll talk to the governor.
Can I call you back?
Uh-huh.
Bye.
Give me some of that stuff.
Where, uh, where's Huey Rauch?
I don't see him around.
Smell this.
I'm a city boy.
Purcell?
That smells like kerosene.
This animal's been shot.
You know anything about it?
What about that truck out there?
Looked like a free worlder.
Now what are these?
I don't know.
Shacks.
Are they on our property?
Let me think.
Honestly...
Yeah!
I think.
Shit.
I don't know who's in there
or what you're up to...
but we got the new warden,
and we're probably coming in!
Right?
Probably nobody home.
I ain't hiding in the dark...
like no human insect.
Yeah? What?
Good morning.
Morning.
Get out here
and take care of this.
Excuse me, I have
a tight schedule.
... like some animal
with one thing on his mind.
Oh, Mother,
even kids can have sex.
Is that what
you do at parties?
How many out there?
Three, four.
I don't want you
getting a reputation.
Pull it up.
I already have one.
The wrong kind.
Marry a man
who respects you.
I want you to have
a good name.
You.! You want.!
Is that all
you can say?
Uh... you want a beer
or something?
Don't talk
like that again.!
