- Have you located suspect?
All right. All right, maintain surveillance.
Kowalski!
And the keys for a sawed-off weekend.
Well, you're both welcome.
- What have you got goin' for Frisco?
- You're not goin' back tonight?
Hey, you're gonna kill yourself
someday, you know that?
- Do you know?
- Yeah, yeah.
Look, why don't you
stay over till Monday, huh?
- So you can go home right now?
- Oh, yeah. Sure, sure. Just before midnight.
Hey, look. Ya know somethin'? When the
clock strikes 12, my car turns into a pumpkin.
- Hey, Sandy. You know you're a born actor?
- Yeah. Sure, sure.
That's what my wife'll say, when I tell her
I've been waitin' up for you all night.
Hey. Look, look, seriously.
Look, why don't you stay over?
- Nah.
- You can do with some sleep, can't ya?
Look, I gotta get started out

Which...?

Hey, K.
What's happenin'?
What's happenin'? What d'you need?
- Speed.
- Why not? Hold that. How you doin'?
- Fine. How are you doin'?
- Lookin' good. Say when.
- Oh, oh, oh. That's good.
- Mm-hm.
- Hey, man, hold it. I'll get you some water.
- That's OK. Forget it.
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm gonna split.
- Hang out for a while.
- Uh-uh. I gotta get moving.
"Gotta get movin',
gotta hit the road." Bullshit.
What about them two chicks
over there to slow you down, huh?
- Yeah, they're beautiful.
- So drop out and join the cause.
No offence, but I gotta
be in Frisco at three tomorrow.
- Ah, you're puttin' me on.
- Wish to God I was.
You're bullshittin' yourself.
You cannot make it.
- Wanna bet?
- This must be a souped-up somethin'?
- Yeah, it's hopped up to over 160.
- Whoo! But even so...
I'm gonna bet you the tab for the bennies.
I'm gonna be in Frisco,
and I'm gonna call you at three tomorrow.
Now, if I don't,
double the deal next time around.
- Bet?
- Bet.
Good luck, buddy!
and what will be seen in crossbreeding,
from the day's farm report.
- Ten seconds, Super.
-
You got it.
Ah! Good morning, folks!
This is yours truly, Super, Super Soul!
Direct and live with no net, early people.
Without a net!
Transmittin' from KOW, spelt K-O-W,
uh-huh, the noisiest, bounciest,
fanciest radio station in the Far West!
Now, let's cheer up the mornin' with some
wham, bam, zoom, boom, wake-up music,
with a little help from my friend!
Now take it away, amigo! Hey, hit it!

And now, crashing into the top ten, comes
the first really monstrous hit of the '70s,
a number that all by itself
jumped 29, 29 places in one week!
Uh-huh! There's absolutely
no doubt whatsoever, as they say,
that this will be next week's number one!
Numero uno, baby!
The itchybang entitled "Where Do You
Go From Here, Baby?" by Brian Obine!
Sock it to 'em, Brian, baby. All right, get to it!

- 123, what's your location?
-
- Ten-four. How far out are you?
-
- Can you give me a description on the car?
-
- Ten-four. Was anybody injured?
-
- Ten-four. Return to your station then.
-
We're on our way in, but you'd best
send a truck for that other motorcycle.
Supe. Pick up on this, man.
"Attention all Highway Patrol stations."
"Suspect vehicle,
Greetings, sir. Let's race.
You got any balls in that mother?
You bastard.
- Car 24 to headquarters.
-
Yeah, we lost him at the Nevada border.
Let Nevada handle it. This guy's nuts.
Yeah, I got it all right.
Initials OA-5599 Colorado plates.
Now, what's this roadrunner done, fellas?
Hey, Supe. I got  on the air now.
Yeah, quite a mother. But fellas, as you
know, we can't throw anything at him
except dangerous driving and failure to stop -
misdemeanours, both of 'em, over here.
-
-
-
-
-
-
May I help you, sir?
May I help you?
- Yeah. Fill her up, please.
- Thank you, sir.
You play ball with me, I'll let you go, huh?
Come on, tell me.
Where do you get the stuff?
Huh? Which house? Come on, come on.
Get out of here.
Get out of here. Go!
And there goes the Challenger, being chased
by the blue, blue meanies on wheels.
The vicious traffic squad cars
are after our lone driver,
the last American hero, the electric Shinta,
the demigod,
the super driver of the Golden West.
Two nasty Nazi cars are
close behind the beautiful lone driver,
the police numbers are gettin' closer, closer,
closer to our soul hero in his soul-mobile.
Yeah, baby. They're about to strike.
They're gonna get him, smash him,
rape the last beautiful,
free soul on this planet.
But, it is written:
"If the evil spirit arms the tiger with claws,
Brahman provided wings for the dove."
- Did you hear that?
- Yep.
Where the hell'd he get so much information?
Same place as you do, Charlie.
- You mean from our own frequency?
- That's right.
How long's he been at it?
Year and a half, maybe two.
Hell, that's against the law.
- So's carryin' a transistor on duty.
- Hey. C'mon, now, that's different.
But he never says anything
to incriminate himself.
Brains and lawyers, Charlie.
As far as the law's concerned,
he's clean as Kleenex.
It's true, true, true, true, my friends.
For, by the latest information,
our soul Challenger
has just broken the ring of evil
the deep blue meanies
have so righteously wrought.
Get through 'em, baby! Get through 'em!
Friggin' faggot.
Gimme that.
This is car 44
reading you loud and clear, over.
We're on 80,
some ten miles from Argenta, over.
Let's go.
C'mon, let's go.
- What do you think he's done?
- Don't know.
Well, what do you think?
I think he's gonna hijack that car to Cuba!
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Hell, Charlie, I don't know.
Maybe killed somebody.
Maybe stole that big dude of his.
Maybe both.
Hey. What's he doin'?
Jesus Christ. Watch it.
Watch it! Watch it!
Move over. Let me take it!
Let go. Let go!
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.
So help me, I'll get that son of a bitch.
Hello, Nevada? Hello, Nevada?
Nevada, this is
Colorado State Highway Patrol.
This is about a special query
raised by the Utah Highway Patrol.
That's correct. But later they asked
that the information be forwarded
to you guys, so get ready for some details.
Put on your tape recorders
and all that sort ofjazz, huh?
This speed maniac you've
been chasing all over your territory
is a former professional
road racer named Kowalski.
K-O-W-A-L-S-K-I.
Repeat, Kowalski. First name unknown,
other particulars also unknown.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
- He's... I lost him.
-
- Headin' for Tonopah.
-
-
- Are you crazy?
Correction. We're still after him,
we haven't lost him. Now come on!
Come on!
Let's go, let's go.
Gimme that.
- Car 44 to headquarters.
-
He's jumped the main road
and headed out into the desert.
I'll let him cook out there for a while.
He ain't goin' nowhere.
What's he tryin' to prove now?
- Any time now, Super.
- Yeah, yeah. Run a tape.
- I already ran a tape twice.
- Are you blind or somethin'?
Can't you see I'm thinkin'?
Crazy.
But my tape deck
is just as jammed with telegrams
as my head is jammed with phone calls
from people
who are wishing you well in your getaway,
no matter where it might lead you.
I wish I could help you, but I can't. I can't.
I don't think anybody can, except
for that crazy lucky streak of yours.
And now you're gonna need more luck.
All of it, perhaps, and badly.
Go to hell.
Wait!
I love this.
I love your scar.
You hate it, but I love it.
No, I don't hate it. I just hate what it means.
What does it mean?
Only if you make war on war
will you overcome it.
I love you. I love you.
- You're crazy, surfing in the middle of winter.
- I'm going out again.
Maybe I'll catch an eight-footer.
Oh! I'll ride it in your honour.
Sayonara. Remember me.
Here we are at point zero
where the Kowalski saga began.
To be interviewed by KLZ TV News is
the owner of the agency, Mr Holly Makas,
and one of the attendants, Sandy McKees.
Sandy, you knew this man best.
What do you think of Kowalski?
- He's a great driver.
- A what?
- What did you say?
- I said he's a great driver.
- We knew that.
- You won't find a driver like him anywhere...
But as a professional,
he never really made the grade.
Well, you know why?
He never really wanted to.
So far as I'm concerned, he was
number one then, and he is number one now.
Can't find a driver with his potential.
Why don't they let him alone?
Let the guy alone!
Look, he never done any harm.
This is Bob Palmer
of KLZ TV News in Denver.
Super Soul needs no introduction
as our number one disc jockey,
but he's on his way to becoming
a national celebrity in his own right,
- as the invisible guide of Kowalski.
- The blind leading the blind.
Kowalski was involved in a cross-country
chase starting in Denver, Colorado.
Stay right where you are, son.
Don't move, stranger. Don't move.
I'll get him for ya.
I'll get him. I'll get him.
Stick your pretty little head
right through there, baby.
That's it. Now we got him.
Now we'll get our basket over here.
Look at that. Live and wrigglin'.
Yeah, ain't that a beauty?
Oh!
Ain't that a fat one, though?
Now we'll get him in here.
Thank you, son. That's got him.
Thank you. How many do you have in there?
I've got six rattlers, two sidewinders, and now
we've got one very precious diamondback.
- What do you do with those things?
- Trade 'em.
Trade 'em for coffee, sugar,
chewin' tobacco, salt, flour and beans.
Lots of beans, son!
You live out here, huh?
Look, I'm lost and I need your help.
- That depends, son.
- What?
You said you needed my help,
so that depends on your helpin' me first.
Helpin' me to get to where it was that...
to get to where it was that I was headed for.
One of them is... is a-comin' on, now.
I can't see a damn thing out there.
I'll bet you can't even see my truck neither,
and that's... just over there.
- Let's get the hell outta here, huh?
- No, that ain't any way to do it. That's no...
That's no way to get the hell out.
No, the best way, to my knowledge,
to get away, is to root right in where you are.
Just root right in.
They just went over, yeah? But stay put.
Tracks. Let's get down and take a look.
They must've found my old truck.
He's circling out here.
It's a truck!
It's a derelict.
Probably been there since the Depression.
He's headin' north. OK.
- Where to now?
- Straight ahead!
Name, Kowalski.
K-O-W-A-L-S-K-I.
Christian name...
Christian name, my flat foot. What is it?
- What is that?
- Faith healers. Don't you come any closer.
- You wait in this automobile, you hear me?
- OK, partner.
Them healers don't like strangers much,
especially their deacon, Jessie Hovah.
He's a... he's a mean one.
- Yeah, don't forget about the gas.
- I ain't forgettin' the gas.
- You're late.
- Mr Hovah, my truck broke down.
- Who is that man over there?
- Just like I was tellin' ya, my truck...
She ain't gettin' any younger now, and...
- Who is that man?
- He's a friend.
A friend, eh? How do you know?
Ain't that a pretty one, though?
Ain't that real pretty?
Yeah.
But we don't need 'em any more.
Look. I told you these meetings are private.
- Why did you bring a stranger here?
- Mr Hovah, I didn't bring him.
He brought  over.
- Why?
- Well, he needs some gas.
Gas.
You just take your gas
and take him out of here.
But, Mr Hovah, ain't you gonna give me
my coffee and sugar and all the...
Yeah, you'll get it.
...all the stuff that you promised me?
- You'll get it.
We just don't need the snakes any more.
We got the music.
So, we are going to...
free the vipers!
I think she's pretty much filled up now.
Yeah.
- Well, you can leave now, son.
- How?
Well, just follow the larrea belt.
- The what belt?
- The larrea belt.
I mean, always keep your eye on the trail
of the sun, and never lose your shadow.
Well, then,
when you see very tall saguaro cactuses,
don't lose them neither,
cos that's the larrea belt.
The saguaro and a creosote tree'll take
you right back onto the trail of the earth.
Uh-huh. So that... that's the road?
That's the road, yeah.
You're beginnin' to get
the fundamentals of it, son.
Maybe. Well, thanks, pa.
Thanks for everything.
You're very welcome.
Hope I'll be seeing you again.
Enlisted in US Army 1960.
Service in Vietnam War.
Wounded, Mekong Delta.
Honourable discharge from army, 1964.
Medal of Honor for bravery in battle.
Entered San Diego police force, 1964.
- Ready now?
- Not yet. Not yet.
- Well, just tell me when.
- I'm ready, but he's not ready yet.
- What?
- Forget it. I'll tell you when I'm ready.
For heaven's sakes.
Oh, come on.
- Push it.
- I  pushin'.
There's a car coming.
Be back in a tick.
Oh! What a relief.
Yes, thank you. You're very kind.
You're welcome.
Pardon me. Could you please
tell us in which direction you're headed?
- I'm goin' to Frisco.
- Oh, well, that's perfect. Thank you.
Is something wrong?
- No, why? Should there be?
- Well, you're so silent and moody.
Maybe it's just part of my nature.
Why are you laughing?
- I'm not laughing.
- Yes, you are.
Way down deep inside yourself.
It's because you think we're queers, isn't it?
Hey...
This is a stick-up.
Stick-up?
Why are you laughing, Mary?
Well, tell me. Tell me!
No, no, no, please. It hurts.
Oh, my hair!
Oh. You bitch!
-
- Hi.
- Welcome back. How you feelin'?
- Tired.
Oh, I bet you're tired. I bet you're tired.
- Well, you wanna know what's happening?
- Yeah. What's happening?
Big Brother's not so much
watching as listening in,
as you well might
have gathered by now.
let us say, "gentlemen" on the road.
They was pretty badly battered up.
Yeah. They musta had
an accident or something like that.
Some smartass was puttin' pressure on them
to charge you with some ugly, nasty crime.
Let us say assault and battery.
But the two gents in question
refused to comply.
Or, as my alter ego might put it,
stickin' to their guns.
Now, listen to this. Some party or parties
are busily preparing a little welcome
committee in the Sunshine State.
The main doors, and even some side doors,
are heavily embellished
with goblins and fuzzy frills.
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, I know what you mean.
Hang on now, brother, hang on.
All right, everybody,
clear the streets and you won't get hurt.
Hey! Hey, nigger!
Hey, loudmouthed nigger!
I'm gonna shut your big black mouth!
Let's get him!
Kowalski! Hi!
Hey.
- Hey, you need any help?
- No, thanks.
- Sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- Far out, man.
- Hey! Wait a second.
- What?
- You got any ups?
- You mean speed?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I got some back at the place.
- How far is it?
- About a mile.
OK. You wanna go back? Far out.

Thanks.
- Do you want more water?
- No, it's OK.
- You keep these. I got a whole bunch of 'em.
- Oh, no, no. I can't use all of that.
Well, take what you need.
- Thanks.
- All right.
Oh, far out, man. That's just
a couple of minutes up the road.
You're gonna make it, Kowalski.
Hey, you, uh...
you familiar with this jock's voice?
Super Soul? Yeah. Why?
- I don't know.
- That's Super Soul.
- Maybe he's got a cold, but that's his voice.
-
- You really think so?
-
- Wait a minute.
-
- Hey! Come here!
-
-
- Come on!
- Listen to this.
-
- Yeah?
-
- Whose voice is that?
- Super Soul. Who else?
- You sure?
- Course I am.
- You absolutely sure?
- Well...
Hang on a minute.
Yeah, it sounds a little different.
He sounds kind of stiff, or square.
He sounds a little mechanical.
- You sense a trap, man?
- Yeah. Maybe.
- You wait here till I get back.
- Where you goin'?
Just wait here.
You gonna stay with us?
No. No, I don't think so.
Is there something I can do for you?
- Well, like what?
- Like anything you want.
No, I can't think of anything.
- You don't fancy me?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Very much.
- Then why don't we have some fun?
- Thanks. Thanks just the same.
That's OK.
- Isn't there something you'd like?
- Yeah.
Yeah, how about a smoke?
- Oh. OK, I'll roll you one.
- No, no, no, no.
No, a straight one.
Yeah.
All right.
Here. Keep the pack.
Thanks.
- You know, you haven't changed much.
- Hm?
- I said you haven't changed much.
- Haven't I?
Here.
That was a long time ago.
I know. I pasted it up when it first came out.
When I cut it out, I...
It's a lot like
shooting jack rabbits, ain't it?
Goddamn, it's hot, I know that.
You're right, man. He sold you out.
More cops than I ever seen, man!
You were sold out.
- What the hell's that for?
- That's your pig pass.
It's police! Clear the road! Clear the road!
Get those cars outta there!
Get those cars back!
That's him! That's him!
Get those cars outta here!
Get those cars outta here!
Get after him! Get after him!
Get those cars outta here! Move! Move!
- Damn!
- Hey, that's my car!
This is California. We don't call them
mothers or speed freaks around here.
But we're gonna do what you haven't been
able to do. We're gonna stop him for good.
Yes, we've been
previously informed of all that.
Thank you, Nevada.
Well, you don't need me any more.
You're in California.
You're almost home.
Can you make it on that?
You bet your ass, baby.
Take care, Kowalski.
Hey, K. I knew you wouldn't make it.
What's happening?
You happening, man.
You all over the front page.
Here's the headline. "Ex-Race Driver
Involved In Massive Police Chase."
Yeah, they even printed
poor Vera's story, plus her picture.
Hey, man. What you out there
drivin' like a wild man?
You know you're gonna lose your gig.
It's not your car anyway. What you trying
to prove, man? Are you high, or what?
Hey, K. You still there?
- You're gassed, man.
- No, listen, it's...
But it's double the bet next time around, huh?
Hey, man.
Don't do no silly shit out there, OK?
-
- OK. I'll see you, amigo.

Ten seconds, Super.

#
#
All righty!
Good morning to all you folks out there.
Sunday morning here,
with all men of goodwill,
and some of evil will
thrown in for good measure.
All peace-loving Christians
getting ready to go to church this morning,
and here I am, yours truly, yeah, Super Soul,
bantering the stream of unconsciousness
and peddling his labels
for the sake of good music
to all you listeners out there.
But I'm here on Sunday
for the first time in my life,
and for the very first time
this KOW radio station begins,
not only to DJ and to do my own thing,
but to tell you a little story.
#
#
#
- #
- #
#
And today, in a beautiful gesture
made by beautiful people,
in beautiful downtown Goldfield,
this radio station was named KOWalski,
in honour of the last American hero,
to whom speed means freedom of the soul.
The question is not when's he gonna stop,
but who is gonna stop him.
Hello, Kowalski. Kowalski.
Please listen, Kowalski.
Oh, it's useless.
Cut it off, man.
Stop!
