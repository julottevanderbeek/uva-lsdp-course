Those words had been dancing
around my head all night.
Just ask any of the old-time pit bosses,
they'll know.
It was a Chinese dealer at Binion's
who was first credited with the line.
He would shout it every time
he dealt blackjack.
That was over 40 years ago,
and the words still catch.
There were certain institutions and people
that frowned upon it,
I was counting cards
and I was up over $640,000.
All right!
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.
- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens again.
Well, that's all right.
I've been winning and losing for years.
And a hand running through
perfect flowing hair meant only one thing.
Stroke. Stroke. Stroke. Stroke.
Premed.
TA to Professors Wilkins and Sanders.
Both of whom are friends of mine,
and who wrote glowing recommendations.
And you're accepted early into school here
at Harvard Med,
pending graduation from MIT.
It's very impressive.
Thank you.
The Robinson Scholarship
is comprehensive, as you know.
It's a free ride.
And free rides don't come easy.
Absolutely.
We have 76 applicants this year,
only one of whom will get the scholarship
and most of whom have résumés
just as impressive as yours.
Right.
Professor Phillips?
Some kids grow up
wanting to play for the Red Sox.
You know, some grow up wanting to be,
I don't know, a fireman.
I grew up... Well, really,
I just wanted to come here to Harvard Med.
And now that I've gotten accepted,
it seems to only come down to the money.
Which I don't really have.
Did you rehearse that?
Unfortunately,
desire doesn't figure into this much.
The Robinson is going
to go to someone who
dazzles.
Somebody who just jumps off the page.
Oh, well, then, I'm also involved
in a science competition.
We're building a robotic wheel
that can navigate itself
using a proprietary GPS system.
Right.
Ben, last year,
the Robinson went to Hyum Jae Wook,
a Korean immigrant who has only one leg.
Well, have you considered
cutting one of them off?
That was a joke.
You need to really explain to us
what makes you special.
What life experience separates you
from all the rest.
Life experience.
that's going to dazzle me?
I'm so sorry I'm late.
- Where is your jacket?
- Oh, I got it. I got it. It's right here.
This is no way for the new
assistant manager to come to work.
Congratulations.
How does $8 an hour sound?
Eight dollars?
Wow! Wow. That's great, Warren.
Thank you. Thank you.
- Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
- Yes, you did.
I'll sleep with him, too,
and I'll get $8 an hour.
So Palmer finishes up his lecture, right?
And I say to him,
"Well, Professor Palmer, you're gonna need
at least 14 capacitance probes
"to get the kind of results
that you're looking for," okay?
So then he says to me, "Miles,
don't you think that's a little excessive?"
And I get up, I swear to God, Ben, I get up
in front of the entire class and I say,
"You can never have
enough capacitance probes."
Oh, my God.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I hope nothing. You just got promoted, man.
You should be happy.
I just gotta write this essay for the
Robinson Scholarship, and I have nothing.
And the reason that I have nothing
is'cause, well, I've done nothing.
- Oh, give me a break, Ben.
- What?
You have everything.
You blow me out of the water,
and I'm a cerebral stud. Is that nothing?
You know, ever since I was 16,
I crushed exams.
I took on extracurriculars.
I showed up early.
I even sat up at the front and I stayed late.
I don't think you gave up sex.
- Okay. Maybe not sex.
- Yeah, you didn't give up sex.
It just annoys me that the one thing
that is stopping me
from going to Harvard Med is money.
You know, tuition fees and living expenses
alone cost over $300,000.
It's outrageous. It's astronomically high.
I get that.
You know, I just thought
there was more to life than just money.
I just saved a bunch of money
on my car insurance.
Thank you.
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thanks, Mom.
Make a wish.
- Make a wish.
- Okay.
Bravo.
Did you know Miles did the frosting on that?
You see that?
It took me five minutes
to figure out it was a Fibonacci series...
Where the next number is 21.
Now you're slipping, Cam.
Oh, really? That's great.
Well, we're not doing it that way.
We're just dividing equally.
So let's say you pay.
I got it, all right?
No, no. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
It's your birthday.
You're as broke-ass as I am.
I just wish now
I had eaten some of those wings.
after 19 cups of coffee.
- Check it out.
- You are kidding. You're kidding!
Yeah, well, it better be'cause this is what
we've been working for since we got here.
This is called destiny.
There is the possibility that
we might not actually win this thing.
Oh, yeah?
Bite your tongue! Bite your damn tongue!
we don't date, we don't travel,
we don't have any money.
The only thing that we do have
is the 2.09 Competition.
We suck.
Yeah.
Do you remember anything about him?
Not really. Maybe when he shaved?
So, what are your plans
for the rest of the night?
I don't know. I'll probably just go back
and work on that essay.
Between the job and school and the 2.09,
you've had no time for just yourself.
You have to squeeze in
a little time for fun, Ben.
You only turn 21 once.
And it goes by very fast.
Okay. All right.
- Good night.
- All right, good night.
- Don't come home before 3:00.
- All right.
All right.
Now, who can explain Newton's method
and how you use it?
You can use it to solve nonlinear equations.
That's impressive. That's really good.
I mean, I'm very impressed by that,
especially since my class
is called Nonlinear Equations.
All right, now somebody tell me something
I don't already know.
Anyone?
Bueller. Anyone? Bueller.
Newton stole it.
- I'm sorry?
- Newton stole it.
Joseph Raphson published
this same method 50 years earlier.
And if the start value is too far removed
from true zero, then it fails.
- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Ben. Ben Campbell.
Ben.
So Ben Campbell suggests
that Joseph Raphson
was the original author of this method.
Well, if that's the case,
then why didn't he get any credit?
Well, for one thing,
Newton had a better publicist.
And for another, after 1700,
we know very little about Raphson
other than the fact that he discovered the
Kabbalah about 300 years before Madonna.
All right, now, let's give Ben a chance
for some extra credit, shall we?
We're gonna call this
the game show host problem, all right?
And you are given a chance to choose
from three different doors, all right?
Now, behind one of the doors is a new car.
Behind the other two, goats.
Door number one?
Door number one.
Ben chooses door number one.
who, by the way,
knows what's behind all the other doors,
decides to open another door.
Let's say he chooses door number three.
Behind which sits a goat. Now...
He says, "Ben, do you want to stay
with door number one
"or go with door number two?"
Now, is it in your interest
to switch your choice?
- Yeah.
- Well, wait.
so how do you know
he's not playing a trick on you?
Trying to use reverse psychology
to get you to pick a goat?
Well, I wouldn't really care.
I mean, my answer's based on statistics.
Based on variable change.
Variable change?
But he just asked you a simple question.
Enlighten us.
Well, when I was originally
asked to choose a door,
I had a 33.3º/º chance of choosing right.
But after he opens one of the doors
and then re-offers me the choice,
it's now 66.7º/º if I choose to switch.
So, yeah, I'll take door number two,
and thank you for that extra 33.3º/º.
Exactly.
if you don't know which door to open,
always account for variable change.
Now, see, most people
wouldn't take the switch
and let simple math get his ass
into a brand-new car!
Which is better than that goat
you've been driving around campus.
That's the end of the day.
Thank you very much.
Your graded papers are down here
at the end.
You can pick them up on your way out.
I am invincible.
Man. That's brutal.
You know,
you should just ask her out, man.
It's not like she's a rocket scientist
or anything.
Because I'm already dating someone.
It does the way I use it.
It does the way I use it.
Hey, you know what?
Maybe I don't even want to go out with her.
You know, you say
you want a life experience, right?
Well, I'd say getting down with that
would definitely qualify.
Cam!
Boy genius.
You have to follow me now.
- Excuse me?
- You have to follow me now.
Come on.
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.
Our honored guest.
- How you doing, Ben?
- I'm okay.
- You ever been in this room before?
- Yeah.
Organic Chemistry in my freshman year.
- How'd you do?
- Well, I got an A.
- Professor Rosa...
- Micky, please.
Is there a problem with my paper?
Well, you found a more efficient method
for finding true zero than Isaac Newton
and that, my friend, is not so much of
a problem as it is a major ass-kicking.
Although Newton has been dead for over
- Kianna.
- Fisher.
- Choi.
- Jill.
- You ever studied blackjack?
- No.
You play against the dealer.
You're given two cards.
Face cards are worth 10 points.
The closest to 21 wins.
If you go over, you lose.
If the dealer goes over, they lose.
It's the most popular card game
in the world.
It's a game with memory.
Cards drawn are the past,
ones to come are future.
Are you talking about counting cards?
- When?
- Weekends. And Christian holidays.
- Where?
- Vegas, baby.
Well, let's just say a spot opened up
on our roster.
How?
Jimmy got a job at Google.
- Jimmy got a job at Google?
- Yeah, it's catchy, I know.
Well, if you're making so much money
at this, then why did he take it?
Yeah... This is crazy.
- Come on, Ben. It'll be fun.
- Yeah, Ben, it'll be fun.
I just got a promotion at my job,
so it's kind of not a good time for me.
We pay better.
Why not? MIT's on cruise control for you,
you've already gotten into Harvard Med.
- How did you know that?
- I like to take an interest in my students.
Well, I'm also really involved
in the science competition.
Wait, no.
I'm building a car that drives by itself.
Yeah, well, it's something I've been doing
with my friends for over a year,
so it's kind of important.
Listen, you not only have a gifted mind,
but you're also composed.
You don't give in to your emotions.
You think logically.
You'll have more fun
than you've ever had in your entire life.
It's perfect.
Thank you. But I'm really not the right guy.
So I'm sorry.
Ben.
I hope this little conversation
we just had will remain private.
- No, of...
- No.
and I'd hate to lose you,
if you know what I mean.
- I'm just not sure it's me.
- Ýt's boring.
It's boxy. It's blue. How is that not you?
Oh, well, let's see, the belt's $49.95,
minus 15º/º.
The jacket's $589.99.
Unfortunately, the shirt's not on sale,
but I can knock off 5º/º from the $69.99.
The shoes were just marked down
from $155,
I'm pretty good with numbers.
- Yeah.
- I guess so.
Yeah, so let me know
when I can ring that up for you guys.
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thanks.
Hey.
Hey.
- Could you help me?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.
I'm looking for a tie.
Oh, well, we're having a 15º/º sale
on the ties.
And if you want,
I could probably get you an additional 10º/º
with my employee discount.
- This one's nice.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
This one has actually been treated with
our patented Nano-Tex fabric protection,
- Well, that's really functional.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty functional.
Face me. Stay still.
Despite being tempted
by the Nano-Tex repellant,
I came to see you.
You did?
Blackjack's a great game.
and there's really not as much strategy to it
as people think.
- You grew up on it?
- Yeah.
Every night after dinner,
my father and I would play.
I knew basic strategy
before I was, like, nine years old.
And what if he won?
He'd still take me out for ice cream.
of winning more money
than you can possibly imagine.
I think you should come to Vegas.
'Cause I'm guessing that you could
probably use a break from this place.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
Okay. If you change your mind,
you know where we meet.
Yeah.
You're welcome any time.
You know,
I think the best thing about Vegas
is you can become anyone you want.
- What's the count?
- Plus 9.
- No.
- Plus 11.
No.
- Dude, I lost count 20 cards ago.
- Don't call me "dude."
- Plus 9?
- You're just following Jill.
People, please. We had a total of 76 cards
that came out of the deck.
Twenty-three were high cards
with a value of minus one.
and the rest were low cards
with a value of plus one.
- How could you lose the count?
- Plus 13.
The count. It's plus 13.
Yes.
Pull up a chair.
Stop.
- What is it?
- Plus 12. Eggs.
- Now what?
- Plus 9.
Cat.
A high card, minus one.
A low card, plus one.
Plus 13. Plus 8. Plus 9. Plus 12.
But it wasn't physics, chemistry
and engineering. I was back to simple math,
And to go unnoticed,
we created a whole new language.
Words were numbers,
and numbers were words.
- Plus 17.
- Magazine.
- Plus 6.
- Gun.
- Plus 15.
- Paycheck.
Plus 12.
Is this chemistry review?
- Plus 14.
- Ring.
- Plus 16.
- Sweet.
Use it in a sentence.
Because I knew the count,
I knew which cards were left in the deck.
You're doing great.
Micky, I just want to let you know
that I'm only doing this for medical school,
I mean, if I can get anything close to that,
then I'm done.
Well, in the first place, Ben,
it's not "if," it's "when."
And second of all,
I get it. I completely understand.
- You do?
- Yeah. It's a means to an end.
Look, they've got this new computer
software that reads people's faces,
so who knows how long this gig's
gonna last for any of us?
What if we get caught?
Our system keeps us under the radar,
you'll see.
- So, there's no danger in it at all?
- No, Ben, it's safe. Very safe.
You think you can beat the system?
You wanna count cards,
you do it in Atlantic City.
- Get him up.
- Come on, kid.
Count to five.
- Count to five!
- What?
Count to five so I know you don't have
brain damage, you can go home.
Start with one.
Let's go.
You're crazy,
everybody knows to split eights.
Not against a 10. It's a sucker play.
against the highest up card
a dealer can have, right?
Yeah, Kianna, save it, all right?
Jill's right. All right?
Choi, why don't you explain to Ben
how we do?
So, our team is divided
into two kinds of players,
So if you think that this table
is the casino floor,
then salt and pepper shakers
are your spotters.
Spotters are just sitting
at the various blackjack tables
and they're betting the table minimum.
They never fluctuate their bet.
That's right. Spotters never raise the bet
or play any kind of progressive system.
That's how we stay under the radar,
and that's why we never get caught.
Exactly. Okay, they're just sitting
at the table, betting the table min,
and they're keeping the count
waiting for one of these decks to get hot.
Right. And then when one of the decks
gets hot,
the spotter at that table signals
in the big player.
This... Mustard.
Give me the mustard, honey. Please.
When I get the signal for the hot deck,
I stumble over like some drunk rich kid,
or some zoned out dot-com millionaire,
and I throw down big money.
So the big player bets big
and still keeps the count.
It's not as easy as it sounds.
because if Grey Poupon over here
ever loses the count,
it's up to his table's spotter
to give him the signal to get out.
- And you know the signals, right?
- Yeah.
Show us.
- The deck's hot.
- Right.
We need to talk.
The deck's cooling.
And get out. Get out now.
Good. I think he's gonna be ready
for our little trial run tomorrow.
There's a trial run?
- Where?
- You'll find out.
Hey.
- You Ben?
- Yeah.
Follow me.
This way.
No more bet. No more bet.
Whose side are you on?
Sixteen.
So, Henry, did I tell you I read
about this place in a magazine?
- You wanna put that money down?
- Yeah. $300.
$300.
$300.
Thanks.
Nice.
Thank you.
What the hell are you doing?
What are you doing?
I haven't done anything! Get off me!
Please. Please let go.
- What's the count?
- Please don't hurt me.
- I said, what's the count?
- Look, I haven't even done anything!
What's the count?
Plus 18.
Sorry, we had to make sure
you'd keep the count under pressure.
Welcome to the team.
We didn't mean it.
Fisher and Jimmy
have always been the big players.
I want you to take Jimmy's place.
I've never done this.
I know that and I understand.
But I don't trust the girls,
and Choi is, well, Choi.
Look, I've been teaching
for more than 14 years,
and I've never had a student
as impressive as you.
Your brain is like a goddamn Pentium chip.
You're gonna do great.
You know how I know that?
'Cause you remind me of myself
You in?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.
- Good. Good.
There's one more thing, Ben,
and this is important.
We're following a specific set of rules
and playing a system.
Right.
I've seen how crazy
it can get at those tables,
They give in to their emotions.
You will not.
You understand?
Yeah.
Get some rest.
- Some rest?
- Yeah, we're leaving tomorrow.
Tomorrow? I have a Quantitative Literacy
paper due Tuesday.
- No, you don't.
- I don't?
I told him you were helping me
with a special assignment,
You see, Ben, amazing things
can happen from the inside.
You'll get a call about details later.
Oh, yeah. They got a lot more bags
to check, you know?
Okay.
Well, wait for us by security
'cause Ben and I are gonna hit the head.
No, I really think you should go.
It's a long flight.
- No, I'm okay.
- We're going to the bathroom.
- I don't care what you have to do.
- Look, I really don't have to...
Please just shut up.
Why are you looking over there?
Look, I don't...
I don't care. Shut up. Get in here.
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.
- Pull down your pants.
- What?
Don't ask questions.
- Shove these in your underwear.
- Why?
You want me to do it?
'Cause, I swear to God, I will.
- Why can't we leave it in the bag?
- Because it shows up on the scanner.
And we're not about
to have them confiscate $250,000.
- No. Why do I have to do it?
- 'Cause you're the donkey boy.
You really suck at not asking questions.
What's a donkey boy?
- Step forward, sir.
- Thanks.
- In the basket, please.
- There's a table when you get to the line.
Remove your keys, any metal objects.
Laptops out, please.
Thank you.
If you have liquids in a Ziploc bag,
please show them to us now.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Your boarding pass.
Sir?
You forgot your bag.
Thanks.
Hey, Ben.
Basic strategy says you should hit that.
Mona, Miss Sommers,
your new identities are on the bar.
So glad you could make it.
Vladimir Stupnitsky?
Yeah. Your dad's a diplomat
with the Russian consulate.
Your hobbies are backgammon, chess
and long walks on the beach.
- I don't like my name.
- Why not?
"Sierra Sommers." Do I look like a Sierra?
Well, you have a lot of clever outfits.
You'll figure it out.
Just pretend you don't speak English.
Then you don't have to change your hair.
You know, I thought this was legal.
Why do we have to use fake names?
Well, it is. We not only use fake names,
we use disguises.
It's for the benefit of the dealers
to make sure you're old enough to gamble
and it allows everyone to be different people
in different casinos.
Hey! You steal the Bible, you go to hell.
That's the way it works.
Like I'm not going already.
Ben, this is for you.
All the casinos have cameras in the ceiling.
They're called "eyes in the sky."
For their benefit, order a tonic water
and lime and act a little drunk,
Let me say that one more time,
you do not know each other ever.
And what's our motto?
- Don't get caught counting.
- Don't get caught counting.
Thank you very much.
How come you don't play?
Oh, I did. I played for a long time
and I was the best. But I'm retired now.
Take my advice, Ben, it's always best
to go out when you're on top.
Welcome to Vegas.
No more bets.
All right, here we go.
Big money, now. Big money.
Let me tell you about blackjack, honey.
You ever hear of basic strategy?
Oh, see,
now that sounds really complicated.
- I'm Sierra Sommers from Charleston.
- Pleasure.
Here to double my family's inheritance.
I don't know.
Sweet. Too sweet.
Can I split those?
- Sir, please don't touch the cards.
- I'm sorry.
Monkey! Monkey!
- So what's a monkey?
- Face card.
All right, face card.
Come on, monkey. Okay, monkey.
Monkey!
Monkey! Come on, monkey,
monkey, monkey! Monkey.
Monkey! Monkey!
I need to quit.
Nice undies.
- What's this?
- It's last night's take.
We split it five ways.
- You were good.
- Really?
Yeah. Came in quick off the count.
You acted the part.
You weren't afraid to play big, and
you got out when you were supposed to.
And you made more money than Fisher.
You know, but after a while,
it felt kind of easy.
Not for everyone.
Good.
We can do some serious damage with you.
Here's the thing I told Micky.
You know, I'm only really doing this
just to pay for medical school.
That's what they all say.
No, really, I mean, I'm just doing this
to pay for Harvard.
It's just a means to an end for me.
I believe you.
Good.
- Hello?
- We have a team meeting in five minutes.
Team meeting.
Hello?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Where's everybody else?
I don't know. Fisher was right behind us.
- I did. With Ida.
- Ida?
She's a dancer. I pulled her out of Sapphire.
- And Ida's her dancer name?
- Yeah. After her grandmother.
Where's Kianna?
Slots.
- Choi, where the hell you been?
- Unattended maid cart, ninth floor.
I've been busy this morning.
This is not summer camp
and I'm not your counselor.
This is real, world-class
moneymaking business.
Choi?
You made five grand last night,
so would you stop stealing nine-cent pens
and everything you can get your hands on
from the maid's cart? It's embarrassing.
But, Fisher,
what the hell were you up to last night?
What?
Three separate occasions, the spotters
let you know that the deck was cooling,
but you kept on anyway.
You either lost the count
or you lost your head.
In either case,
I don't wanna see it happen again.
And Ben, good work. You came out
of that chute like a pro. Keep it up.
Beginner's luck.
Micky, I didn't play
into a cold deck three times.
You know what's worse than a loser?
Someone who won't admit
he played it wrong.
Take it up with Ida.
Who's Ida?
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.
- Who the hell is Ida?
- Shut up.
There goes that paycheck.
- Money plays.
- Money plays, up to the limit.
How's she doing?
The way I see it, yesterday's history,
tomorrow's a mystery.
Just lost another property.
- Who is it this time, Caesars or the Mirage?
- Caesars.
That was a 14-year account.
- They opted to go with the new software.
- I know, Terry, I know.
Hey, Cole. We got absolutely murdered in
pits four and five the last couple of nights.
I appreciate it.
Ben. Time for school.
I seem to keep waking up to you.
Don't get used to it.
I'm glad you came over this morning.
- I have something I wanna give you.
- Oh, yeah?
I want you to have this.
What's this?
That's a lot of money.
I've been saving for a long time.
It's for medical school.
I know it won't pay the whole way,
but it should help.
This is your money.
You worked hard for this.
For precisely this reason. I wanna help pay
for med school, Dr. Campbell.
'Cause I got the Robinson Scholarship.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Well, because I wanted it to be a surprise.
This is amazing. I am so proud of you.
- I knew the hard work would pay off.
- Yeah, I know.
So, listen, you keep this, all right?
It's yours.
What are you doing?
I'm just jumping up and down on my bed.
What? You never did that
when you were a kid?
- No. Not really, never.
- No.
Right.
All right.
So where were you this weekend?
I tried calling you, like, 15 times.
Oh, yeah? I ended up
having to go to New Hampshire
to help my cousin move.
You didn't bring your cell phone?
Your cell? Your phone?
You didn't bring that?
No, I forgot it. I ended up leaving it here.
So, you know.
Yeah, well, you missed
a hell of a dorm party on Saturday.
We almost had a girl there.
- Republik?
- Yes.
Let's do it!
She is an eight.
- No way. She's a 7.649.
- I was rounding up.
Hey, I thought we agreed
we weren't gonna round up anymore.
That's right.
Hey. Can I get you a beer?
- Sure.
- Yeah? Okay.
Excuse me. Can I get two Bud Lights?
Hey.
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Thank you.
Are those your friends over there?
No. No, I've never seen them before
in my life.
Could you just excuse me for one second?
Guys, I'm serious.
What are you doing? You're staring.
I think it's gonna freak her out a bit,
don't you think?
Yeah, I got a feeling we're a little
more freaked out than she is right now.
So how do you know her?
Did you, like, take some self-help seminar
or something?
What?
- Jedi mind trick, huh?
- Jedi mind trick. Like that Luke.
- You will drink beer.
- Right. Right, right.
There is a fortune on the table now,
and it's all up to my dad.
It's getting ridiculous.
He actually needs to stop the table play,
track down my uncle and take a loan.
- No, are you serious?
- Yeah.
The dealer turns over a 17.
It's soft. He needs to take another card.
No. Don't say a four. Is it a four?
- It's a four, yeah.
- It's a four. My God.
Not a great Christmas that year.
So, what does he think about what you do?
Does he know?
So, you know, when you came into the store
to ask me to join the team,
was that because...
What?
Well, you know,
was it because Micky asked you to?
You gave that presentation
on combinatorial algorithms
that nobody understood.
You're the smartest person in every single
one of those classes, Ben.
That is why you're on the team.
And that's why I came into the store.
- Oh, God. I'm so, so sorry.
- No. It's fine.
- It's not a problem.
- I don't know why I just did that.
- Don't apologize.
- Are you sure?
- You're getting off here?
- Yeah, I've gotta get off.
I don't know,
it's just'cause we've been drinking, and...
- I get it.
- Just don't feel bad about this.
Okay. Sure. Bye.
My world was flashing by
at a million miles a minute.
But there was still one thing
I couldn't get off my mind.
were replaced with counting,
shuffle tracking
knowing when to hit
and knowing when to color out.
than I would have in 5 years, 9 months,
