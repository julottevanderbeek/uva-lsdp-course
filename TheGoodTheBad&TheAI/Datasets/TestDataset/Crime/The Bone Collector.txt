Paulie, how's it look?
Snitch says the cop's body's...
about 300 yards down
in an abandoned tunnel.
Howie?
Right behind you, Captain.
Keep back till I process
the scene, okay?
So where the hell
is the car?
I don't know.
That's the last time I'm going
to take a goddamn red-eye.
Maybe we can take a cab.
He's always got
an excuse.
Yeah, okay.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I think you're going
the wrong way.
Excuse me.
Honey?
Honey, wake up.
We're lost, or he's
taking us for a ride.
We're in the middle
of nowhere.
Hey, where the hell
are you going?
I said Fifth Avenue.
Hey! We're not
tourists here, man!
Hey! Where are you going?
Stop this car, man!
Can't--
Ah! Shit!
Son of a bitch!
Stop the goddamn car!
Hey!
Please!
Stop the car!
-
- Stop the car, goddamn it!
Stop this car!
You're looking
a little dehydrated.
How about some juice?
How about two fingers
of vodka?
A little early for vodka,
don't you think?
Time, as you well know,
is a relative consideration,
Thelma.
- Juice.
- Vodka.
Juice.
Juice.
Coming!
Join me in a drink, Richard?
I'd love to, but a med-tech
with liquor on his breath?
I think not.
So how are you?
Well, I'm better than
your heart-pacing gear.
Every time I'm here,
it's skewed further out of spec.
I really need a new body.
I'm afraid I can't help you
with that, but I'll bring
your new unit by tomorrow.
- Okay.
- This one'll be stable
till then.
Thank you, Richard.
You take it easy.
I'll take it any way
I can get it.
Hey, would you
look at this?
A... peregrine falcon.
Am I right?
Yep. He likes cripples.
There was a piece about them...
in the  the other day
nesting all over the city.
Something to do with
the architecture of all
these old New York buildings.
I thought he liked
my company.
They're a little shy.
Uh, don't take it personally,
Barry.
- Can I get you a drink, Doc?
-
Bed mode.
Got vodka in there?
No.
And you ain't gettin' any,
either.
All right.
I'll let you guys talk.
you can imagine how much sleep
I've gotten the past few days,
considering your request.
That's funny. Since I made
my decision, I've been
sleeping like a baby.
After all, you have survived,
beat all the odds.
You know as well
as I do there's work
on nerve regeneration every day.
One... finger,
two shoulders and a brain.
That's all I have, Barry.
These dysreflexia seizures
are occurring more frequently.
We both know I'm
waiting for the...
seizure that's gonna
make me a vegetable.
I don't want
to be a vegetable, Barry.
I want to make the final
transition on my own terms.
I'll get it done
with or without you.
Oh, yeah? Yeah,
I suppose you would.
So?
Okay.
Okay, what?
Okay, I'll assist you...
in your final transition.
-
- My business is in order.
My bags are packed.
Besides, I've-- I've got
a medical conference to go to.
I've got a plane to catch.
You're lying.
When do you get back?
- Sunday.
- Okay. Sunday.
- I'll see you then.
- Get the hell out
before you change your mind.
Don't bother to get up.
I'll show myself out.
Yeah, I'll race you to the door.
You are...
Amelia?
Hey. Morning.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I just couldn't sleep.
What time is it?
It's early.
I'm gonna be late for work.
I gotta shower.
Come on. No, you don't.
Stay here.
I-- I gotta go.
Hey, I'll make breakfast?
No, thanks.
I'm gonna be late.
Another
slam-bam-thank-you-ma'am?
All right, look.
My therapist tells me...
I might not be
getting what I need
out of this relationship.
You know where I stand on this.
You know what I want.
Steve, we've been through this.
I care about you.
You know that.
I can't make a commitment.
Go to work, then.
So, Amelia, it's true
you're quitting the cops?
No, I'm transferring
to Youth Services.
You lucky fuck. You must have
one hell of a rabbi downtown.
We're gonna miss you
in this neighborhood.
Be advised
frightened child at Amtrak site.
I'm a block away. I'll take it.
Some kid found something
over at the tracks.
Finish eating.
I'll check it out.
See you, kid.
All right.
Nothing yet.
Wait there, okay?
- Are you outta your mind?
- Just shut off the engine,
all right?
There's been a homicide.
I can't let you through.
My name's Amelia.
What's your name?
Chris.
Chris, hey.
I got a job for you.
Here's some money.
I need you to buy me one of
those cheapo cardboard cameras.
The ones you can throw away?
Yeah.
Okay.
Fast as you can.
Send a bus. Get those
passengers out of here.
Detective Solomon.
First officer on the scene
is over there.
I collected it
before it was washed away.
I also took some pictures.
Thanks.
You're the one
that stopped the train?
Yes, sir. I thought
it might have disturbed
the physical evidence.
Why not shut down Grand Central
while you're at it, hmm?
Patrolman Donahue?
Is that right?
Donaghy.
A rookie, I take it.
No, sir.
Pretty dumb.
-
- Talk to me.
- Alan fucking Rubin.
-
You got company.
Cops.
They said it was urgent.
Tell them I'm out running.
She's too polite for that,
Linc.
I, uh-- I caught
a serious situation, Linc.
Yeah, well, that's
going around, Paulie.
Chief Murphy sent me.
Ah. Good chief.
-
- Have you heard about
that couple at the airport...
got in a taxi
yesterday morning?
Never made it home?
He don't watch
the news anymore.
You used to
read four papers a day,
tape all the news shows.
Now I just hit
the rewind button. A-3.
Yeah, well, that was Alan Rubin
and his wife in that taxi.
shoved on one of his fingers
which was skinned to the bone.
- She's still missing.
- Excuse me while you guys
catch up, okay?
Don't go too far, Thelma.
We'll be letting these nice
gentlemen out in 30 seconds.
Sounds like you got yourself
an open-and-shut there, Paulie.
- I don't think so.
- A man worth several
hundred million dollars...
found dead with
his wife's wedding band
on his mutilated hand.
What's that tell you?
He's probably contacting
the family right now,
making a ransom demand.
I'd have been paged
if he had.
It's definitely a ransom.
Excuse me.
Mr. Rhyme,
Kenneth Solomon.
I've read all your books.
at least a dozen times.
It's great to actually meet you.
Where do you find
these guys, Paulie?
They wanna work
with the best.
I guess now you're gonna
ask me to...
discuss the crime scene
with you, huh?
As a matter of fact, we've got
a bunch of physical evidence
that doesn't make sense.
Some seriously weird stuff.
It's all in the report.
- Linc, you okay?
-
Hey, Linc, you okay?
Out, now!
Anything we can do?
Asses out of here now!
-
- I said out!
Thelma?
You okay?
I would be okay if
your powers of resuscitation
were a little less adept.
Not on my shift,
all right?
If you have
a problem with that,
you can just fire my ass.
You know I provide generously
for you in my will.
Keep that in mind.
Rhyme, I am not interested
in having this conversation.
Okay?
Okay. Crime scene report
Sellitto left.
Would you take those photos,
load them into the viewer
for me?
View scan.
Okay. Let's look
at what we got here.
Where it says "location--"
What's that--
What's it say
about that newspaper?
"Newspaper found beneath
a coarse-thread hex-bolt with
'4:00 p.m.' circled on it."
"4:00 p.m." Zoom.
A torn book page
with 119 on it.
One-- One--
Eleven, nine.
What's today's date?
Today's November 9.
Phone mode.
Sellitto, Paulie. Call.
Now.
Here are some of the drugs
they'll most likely be offered.
Marijuana.
How'd you like
to get your hands
on that briefcase?
Cocaine.
Rock cocaine.
You wanna tell me
what this is about?
You know who Lincoln Rhyme is?
Textbook guy?
Yeah.
What does that
have to do with me?
We'll find out.
Hey. Come on in.
They're right in there.
Yeah, first one on the scene.
It started to rain.
Smart cop.
Meet Lincoln Rhyme.
Donaghy.
Took some terrific photographs,
Officer.
You know who I am?
I read your manual
at the academy.
What'd you think of it?
I'm not a book critic, sir.
Yeah, I guess so.
"Guess so."
Sure you did.
I mean, you stopped that train.
Photos you took.
I'd say you have a natural
instinct for forensics.
So what do we got, Paulie?
We have footprints, size ten,
thanks to Officer Donaghy...
A book page with 119
written on it.
Paulie, I'm convinced that
this crime scene was staged.
Perp's trying
to tell us something.
What the fuck are you saying?
Book page 119. 11, 9.
That's today's date.
Newspaper, 4:00 p.m.
What time you got?
She's alive, Paulie.
We have your interest yet,
Officer?
I want you
to work the case with us.
Uh, it's not my area.
Are you being modest
or are you...
a little uneasy about doing
some real police work?
Excuse me?
What department
you work in, Officer?
Youth Services Division.
I picked her up
at orientation.
Ah, I see.
Youth Services.
I've wait-listed over a year
to get that transfer,
and I am not gonna jeopardize--
Jeopardize what?
Cushy desk job?
Forensics is not my area.
I disagree with you.
You can't force me
to take this assignment.
- I can.
- And if I refuse?
I would say that you're
putting your career
at serious risk.
You think because of your
condition you have the right
to push people around?
I'm sorry.
That is truly pathetic.
Truly?
You're damn right, truly.
Well, forgive me,
if I insist on having
someone with your brains
and a fresh pair of eyes.
Paulie, we're gonna
need some key people
and some tech support.
Okay?
I know the guys.
Okay.
What the hell
are you smiling at?
Pull up a chair.
I want you to tell me
everything you know
about the crime scene.
Basically,
it's all in my report.
I read your report.
I want to know
want you felt,
what you feel...
in the deepest recesses
of your senses.
Why, you really are
in love with the sound
of your own voice, aren't you?
Now it's your voice I'm yearning
to hear. Pull up a chair.
I won't bite you.
The rifling on the .38 slug
they dug out of the victim...
is consistent with
a Webley, a very old
turn-of-the-century handgun.
Thank you, Kenny. On the
big board, please. Paulie,
what do you got on that bolt?
There's three initials
on the head-- N.S.G.
And the bolt's not steel.
It's iron.
Making it old, like the Webley.
Uh, it kills hard-working
Americans every day.
-  Very good.
You computer literate?
- A little.
Thelma! Thelma?
Where's my Thelma?
but she's got an A-plus nose
for evidence.
So I want you
to give her a crash course
in how to access D.E.P. files.
A.S.A.P.
Where the hell
is Eddie Ortiz?
Eddie?
How's the world's
crankiest criminalist doing?
- Playing beat the clock,
you know?
- Everybody's worst nightmare.
You get into a cab, and there's
a damn psycho from Jersey
behind the wheel.
We don't know
he's from Jersey.
Yeah, Bayonne. It's the toxins
in the water over there.
- What'd you do?
Bring the whole lab with you?
- Mama told me "be prepared."
- Where do you want this shit?
- Over here in the corner.
Oh, God. She's 76,
and she's schtupping
some guy named Morris.
- God bless her.
- But it's Morris the schtarker
I'm worried about.
He's 79 with a tricky ticker
and an active pecker.
Hey.
- Afternoon. Captain Cheney.
-
There's about
a dozen cleanups scattered
about the five boroughs.
Fine, thank you.
How's it going?
In the middle of the middle,
as you can see.
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, Linc, look what I found
on the threading of that bolt.
Huh. I was hoping
to grab a minute with you,
if you don't mind.
- Excuse me, Howard.
- Oh. Sorry, sorry.
We got Officer Donaghy here
to thank for photographing
the crucial evidence.
Crucial evidence?
We don't know that.
Listen, Linc, I just
stopped by to make sure you
had all the support you need.
As you know, I'm putting
the full resources of my
department at your... disposal.
And I appreciate it,
Howie. Thank you.
you see, I've formalized the
department's standard procedures
since you were in charge, so--
Eddie, could you put what you
got up on my screen, please?
- Absolutely.
- At all times.
At all-- Eddie, what the hell
is that we're looking at?
I'd say, uh,
Turn of the century,
it looks like.
Huh. The perp
likes old.
Look, I'll be in my office
if you need me.
Yeah, okay, Howard.
Good.
Old paper.
Old gun.
Sand.
Sand, sand. What--
Eddie, what do you got
on the sand?
Doesn't really
look like sand.
Can you individuate it?
Oh, if I had an E.D.X. here,
I could do anything.
We don't have a goddamn
"E" the fuck "X," Eddie!
Oh, look who forgot their
chill pill this morning.
Excuse me.
Okay, we're talking,
uh, pearly looking.
Some kind of a...
shellfish or something.
Oyster shells maybe?
Could be.
Definitely. If I had to bet
on it, I'd say it was. Sure.
In 1913 when the Woolworth
Building was being built,
workmen found the body
of this rich industrialist,
Talbot Soames.
And what they thought
was white sand turned out
to be oyster... shells.
Crushed oyster shells. That's
what they used as landfill
in lower Manhattan.
Somewhere downtown.
Hey, Paulie.
Call Emergency Services Unit.
Have them meet us
down by the Woolworth Building.
Tell them to start their search.
Maybe we'll get lucky.
Okay? Eddie.
Did you bring your van?
Yeah.
Uh, it's downstairs.
Throw your keys to Amelia.
Paulie, you and Solomon
go with her.
- Shouldn't I go with them?
-
- Shall we keep
Cheney in the loop?
- Fuck him.
Fuck him.
Follow those instincts
you were born with.
I'll be with you...
every step of the way.
Jesus, 25 minutes left.
How did Rhyme
get to be that way?
He was
born brilliant. It happens.
I mean
the physical part.
About four years ago,
he was working the body
of a transit cop...
been found shot
in a subway tunnel.
Beam came down, damn near
cut him in half.
Jesus. Family?
Married sister in Phoenix.
Technically, he's
still on active duty,
collecting full pay.
P.B.A. insurance picks up
round-the-clock care
and all the gadgets.
On weekends, always one or
two cops there lending a hand.
Tough deal
winding up like that.
You won't hear him complaining.
Nah, he gets too much pleasure
pushing other people's buttons.
In your case,
I'd be complimented.
You gotta learn to relax
around a compliment,
especially one from Rhyme.
- You can be a little grating.
- Me?
Kiddo, if you were any more
wound up, you'd be a Timex.
lecturing all over the world,
giving expert opinion in trials,
working half the crime scenes
in the city.
- You know what he'd do
in his downtime?
- I can't imagine.
He'd collect things--
dirt, metals, plastics,
hubcaps, plants,
musical strings,
- Obsessive.
- No, he'd have it all analyzed
and catalogued...
for his whatchacallit--
database.
Jesus Christ! I'd like
to get there in one piece,
if possible.
-
- Nicholas Steven Gerard.
- Elevator construction.
- Gotta be underground.
I got a subway builder.
Sounds--
Excuse me! N.S.G.
Niagra Steam Generation.
Bought by Eastern Gas
and Electric in 1928.
The six-inch iron bolt
was used mainly for
steam pipe assemblies.
No. No.
We just hit
the financial district.
There's a steam junction...
with big asbestos-coated pipes.
That's where
our victim's gonna be.
I'd bet my legs on it.
She's gonna be
at Wall and Nassau.
Has E.S.U. been notified?
E.S.U. says that steam is
released through that junction
every day at 4:00 p.m.
Shit, what's this asshole
up to?
All right, Linc, we're here.
We're going down there.
Yeah, I'm here.
It's their job to try and
save Mrs. Rubin's life. It's
your job to get ready and...
and you'll see an aluminum
suitcase and a radio headset.
See it?
There must be a way in.
Fuckin' valves freeze up easy.
Come on, guys.
Shut it off.
You there?
I'm inside the pipe.
Go!
I hear something!
I hear something!
Everyone, quiet now!
- Mrs. Rubin?
-
She's in there, Linc.
Come on, guys.
Let's go, let's go.
Let's hurry the fuck up.
- Get drill and a tap.
- Somebody cut this thing
halfway through.
Back! Back!
Paulie?
Paulie?
Linc, she's gone.
Let's go!
This way!
...is in some way--
E.S.U. are gonna blow a hole
in the subbasement wall.
- There's no other way in.
- It's my understanding...
I'm working with Chief Murphy's
authorization on this, right?
Yeah, that's right.
I don't want those Emergency
Services guys rushing in there,
trampling the evidence
before we get a chance
to run the scene.
When they blow the hole,
I want Donaghy to go in first.
Hey, come on, Linc. She's not
trained for this. We could
get our asses in a sling.
My ass has been in a sling
for four years.
Tell Hanson and his beasts
that's what I want. Period.
Okay, let's move!
You can't handle it in there,
I want you to get your ass out.
Amelia, you ready?
Yeah.
Listen to me.
I'm with you
every step of the way.
Go on.
Good luck.
Tell me what you see.
Oh, God.
What is it?
It's an awful smell.
That means you're close.
I can't believe
I'm doing this.
You're fine.
Just fine. You're doing great.
Now just remember the academy.
When you walk,
move in a straight line.
We don't want to disturb
any footprints he might've left.
Yeah, assuming he's gone.
Oh, God.
What?
Talk to me.
Talk to me, Amelia.
The steam pipe was opened,
Okay. There's nothing
you can do about that now.
You can't do anything for her
but help her by...
working the crime scene;
that's your job.
- I can't do this.
- You can do it.
Yes, you can. Yesterday
you stopped a train.
You can do anything you want
when you put your mind to it.
Don't work me, Rhyme.
Very slowly, walk the grid...
I want you
to look around you now.
Remember, crime scenes
are three dimensional.
-
- Yeah, I'm here.
There's something strange.
Things he left for us?
Yes.
All right, I'm gonna walk you
through collecting the evidence.
You do everything
exactly as I say.
Oh, Jesus.
Talk to me.
It's a bloody bone.
It's in my fucking hand.
Human?
I think so, yeah.
All right.
Photograph it. Bag it.
Okay, that's it.
I'm outta here.
One more thing.
We gotta process the body.
Just describe the restraints.
Okay.
They're strange-looking
handcuffs.
They look more like
old shackles or something.
Hands above her head?
Yeah.
It's right down to the bone.
It looks like it was
surgically removed.
This is
what I want you to do.
We're gonna need
those handcuffs, Amelia.
It's probably our
best chance for good prints.
The M.E. can remove them
when they get here.
M.E. is all thumbs.
They're--
They'll mess up the prints.
Look in the suitcase.
There's a small saw.
Okay.
I want you to saw her hands off
at the wrist line.
We gotta have those cuffs
for prints.
I can't.
Cut her hands off.
We need the handcuffs.
I can't. No.
Saw off her hands.
Take off the cuffs.
- I can't.
- Listen to me.
- Saw off her--
We need those cuffs.
- I can't!
- Amelia, we need--
- No! Fuck you!
Amelia. Amelia.
He wants the woman's hands
cut off, he can come
and do it himself.
Amelia? Amelia.
Amelia.
Hello?
Who is it?
Hello?
Jesus.
Hey, hey, take it easy!
- Are you okay?
- What the fuck are you doing?
Rhyme's been trying
to call you for hours.
Your phone's down.
He was concerned.
My phone's fine.
I don't need his concern.
He needs you over
to his place right away.
Well, I don't work
for Lincoln Rhyme.
Rhyme believes the evidence
you collected is telling him
there's another vic in play.
And he is laying that
at my feet?
Don't shoot the messenger.
You just move in?
Really?
You were a model.
- Yeah, when I was a kid.
- Kid model to street cop.
There's a leap.
For whatever it's worth,
I thought what you did today
was pretty damn terrific.
Hey, you guys,
I'm outta here.
I'm gonna grab a cab.
I've got a paper to finish.
I'm just gonna hang.
No problem.
I'll be there
in a minute.
I'm workin'
fast as I can.
Glad to see
you could join us.
I got Cheney on the line.
He wants you to brief him.
Tell him I'll
call him back.
Two things:
First, you did
a hell of a job
locating the evidence.
There's no question
the perp knows forensics.
you know,
the victim's hands,
well, maybe, um--
maybe it was
too much to handle,
so we'll just forget it.
Is that your version
of an apology?
An apology?
Is that why you
came over here?
You really are
a piece of work.
Well, aren't we a pair.
I think you're terrific.
You got a hell
of an arrest record too.
Why do you want
to throw it all away
to chase youth offenders?
I don't feel I have any need
to explain that to you.
Come on, Amelia,
cop to cop.
Cop to cop,
let's just leave it
at personal reasons.
Okay.
Doesn't have anything to do
with your father, does it?
Man, you just keep charging
at walls, don't you?
Stubbornness is
something we both share.
You know, they say,
genetically speaking,
that we come into this world
with a preordained destiny.
I don't believe it, though.
For example, my parents.
Neither of them had more than
an eighth grade education,
never read more than one book
between them, not one.
I've read thousands.
I've written a dozen.
What's your point?
My point... is that destiny
is what you make it.
Whatever happened
to your father doesn't mean
it's gonna happen to you.
It's a gift.
An NYU student was abducted
late last night.
His girlfriend saw him
struggling to get out
as the taxi driver...
No description
of the driver.
- Okay, everybody,
this could be our next victim.
- Yeah, Tony.
Did you get a deadline
off that evidence yet?
Not yet.
Something I was hoping
you'd help me with.
No! No!
No!
What?
The bone we found
at the Wall Street scene--
veal shank.
Braised and overly salted
to boot.
A cow bone?
Uh-huh.
And I also found a piece
of that old paper...
Take a look.
What's going on?
Just do what you need to do
as quickly as possible.
This came in from the F.B.I.
It's about the hair follicles.
He says they're not human.
A rodent, probably a rat.
Get this-- they were
shaved off.
Now we're looking
for a rat that shaves.
I really like that.
I've known a few in my time.
How about you, Amelia?
More than a few.
It's consistent
with underground,
that's for sure, huh?
What's he trying to say to us?
Definitely communicating
in our language.
Leaving clues.
Forensic clues, at that.
- Maybe it's a cop.
- Maybe.
If we don't figure out
the clues in time,
the blood's on our hands.
What do you got on that dirt
you scraped from the wood?
I don't have it 100 percent
individuated, but it does
appear nitrogen-rich.
All set.
Ready to rock and roll.
Thanks for rushing, man.
Thank you, Richard.
Nitrogen-rich.
Explosive carbons. Where
do you find those in New York?
Bomb sites.
Shooting ranges.
Maybe an old fort
or an armory.
- Let's not forget
the shit factor, guys.
- The what?
Manure becomes a nitrate
when it's aged.
That's true.
And you got
cow bones, huh?
Old cow bones, old manure.
Turn of the century.
Cows, farms,
pastures, rats.
Dead cows.
Where do you find--
In stockyards.
Slaughterhouses--
that's what we wanna look for.
Check the Internet.
Okay, I want tax records,
sanitation records...
and building code inspections,
last hundred years,
okay?
You're pushing it
too hard, Rhyme.
I understand, Thelma.
What do we got
on the stockyards over there?
Almost there.
You okay?
No, I'm not okay.
I can't figure out
this damn time line...
or these shards
of cardboard.
We got three
defunct stockyard sites.
There's one on the East Side.
Good.
Solomon, put the box down.
Mark it down on the viewer
as she calls them off.
Your blood pressure's
gonna blow a gasket
if you don't slow down.
My body has a mind of its own.
It doesn't listen to me,
all right?
What else, Amelia?
Yeah, there's another
on the Hudson up at 155th.
- Mark it down, Solomon.
- Look, your stats
are going down.
-
- What else?
- There's one underground
at Greenwich and Houston.
- Mark it down, Solomon.
- Why don't you
knock it off, Linc?
- I don't need to knock it off!
Wh-What was the first one
that you mentioned?
Lexington and
the Harlem River Viaduct.
- And when did it close?
- 1910.
When is that?
Uh, 1898.
And Hudson and 155th
was closed in 1906.
All right.
Let's-- 1898.
Houston and Greenwich.
Call Emergency Services, Paulie.
Tell 'em... meet us
at Houston and Greenwich, okay?
- You go with them.
-
Linc, you there?
Yeah. Ready.
Okay. Amelia?
Yeah.
All right. Same drill.
I want you in first.
Let's do it.
You watch yourself,
Amelia.
Man, I don't
like this.
I don't like this.
Linc, I got a bad feeling
about this, man.
Not yet, Paulie.
Just hold back.
Cement walls.
Always has.
Metal hooks...
and a pen.
It's a slaughterhouse.
You hold 'em off.
Don't want 'em
contaminating the scene.
-
-  Hold it.
Hold up, hold up!
You're not to go in.
Why?
Rhyme's orders.
Fuck him!
Get me Cheney on the line.
Fuck Rhyme.
Maybe this one's
still alive.
Perp didn't leave
a deadline.
It means we're probably
too late.
- You don't know that, Rhyme.
- Get off the line.
Just move on, Amelia.
You know, there's
five basic contaminants
to every crime scene.
I'll skip to the worst one--
other cops.
I think
I hear something.
-
-
I hate this shit.
We're goin' in.
No, you're not.
No, you're not!
-  Go, go!
-
Oh, God.
He cut him up pretty bad
and left him for the rats.
Goddamn son of a bitch.
You okay?
I'm fine.
You wanna step aside
so I can walk the grid?
Yeah. Yeah.
All right.
Let's back 'em up.
Let's give her some room.
Move it, guys.
Okay.
You know what to do.
Rhyme, I found it.
Will somebody get that
black suitcase and bring it
over here, please?
Sounds like you're starting
to enjoy this work.
Damn!
The press is here.
Right there,
right there.
Lincoln Rhyme is
no longer working this case.
I'm takin' over. Understood?
Do what you wanna do,
Captain, but maybe you ought
to check with Murphy first.
Fuck Murphy
and fuck Rhyme.
I, for one, am not taking
the heat for that.
You understand, hmm?
Call Ortiz.
Tell him and his crew
to vacate Rhyme's place now.
Excuse me,
but the victim was already
dead when we arrived.
And you, half-assed patrolman
working a crime scene,
those days are over.
I'll take that evidence bag
now, thank you.
You can take it with a chain
of custody voucher, sir.
Are you outta your mind?
- Hmm?
You're not
gonna find any prints.
The guy's too good for that.
Well, it looks like
we have a nice, clean
friction print here.
Unless, of course,
it's yours.
No. I was wearing gloves
when I collected it.
We'll know soon enough.
Put this through,
highest priority.
Thank you.
Hey, you know,
I got a feeling this perp's
been in business a long time.
Yeah, I hear you, but that's
Cheney's problem now.
Yeah, that's what scares me.
Do me a favor, will you?
Check and see if
there's been any homicides
in the last 12 months...
involving surgically removed
flesh exposing bone.
No problem.
I'll see you soon.
Hope so, Eddie.
Don't you let him run
no circles around you now.
Stay right, Eddie.
Oh, that print.
We just got a positive
I.D. on it.
The guy has three
extremely violent priors.
Oh, look at that.
Taxi license, no less.
We got him.
Let's go, boys!
Somebody call E.S.U.
Now slide out
nice and easy.
Hey!
Hey.
I was hoping
you'd show up.
He's been worried
about you.
Yeah, sure.
Scene of the Crime,
Hey.
Poor Cheney, huh?
Grabbed the ball
with both hands and scored
one for the other team.
I can't comment
at this time--
Yeah.
I tried to warn him
that the perp was too smart
to leave a print.
How you doin'
with that stuff?
Maybe this'll help.
Cheney will have
your badge for that.
You could bring it
back to him.
The man is a living monument
to ineptitude.
True.
Let's take a look.
There's something
really strange about it.
You gotta smell it.
Sure.
Are you--
Oh, shoot.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Take your time.
Okay.
You have to put it
closer to my nose.
What do you think it is?
Kerosene?
Possibly.
This just came in
from Eddie Ortiz.
Amelia, could you load these
into the viewer, please?
Shit!
Sorry about that,
Thelma.
E.C.U.
View scan.
"Dear Linc:
I'm enclosing photos of
four unsolved homicides...
"which took place
in the last 12 months.
"Flesh has been
surgically removed from each
of the victims' extremities.
I miss you.
Love, Eddie."
I'm gonna spare myself
the pleasure, if you don't mind.
Same mark.
Same messages.
The perp was trying
to make contact even then.
But Cheney never
put it together.
Thelma!
Dysreflexia seizure,
a bad one.
Come on.
Breathe with me.
Damn catheter's blocked.
Hang on. Hang on.
Just let me check it.
Come on.
Hang on, Rhyme.
Hang on.
Is he gonna
make it?
If he does,
he won't be happy.
What-- What are you
talking about?
He's already finalized
arrangements to self-terminate.
He's convinced
some doctor friend to help...
with his "final transition,"
as he calls it.
But suicide?
I mean--
It's the seizures.
Any one of 'em could put him
into a vegetative state.
Who is it?
Captain Cheney!
What can I help you with?
Police business.
Open up, please.
Mr. Rhyme is asleep.
Well, wake him up.
I need to see him now.
Let me deal with
this asshole Cheney.
You watch him.
Anything, just call me.
He's all right.
Look, lady.
Now, I hope you know
that obstructing justice
is a felony offense.
You got a smart mouth,
and it's gonna get you
in trouble one day.
Yeah, and it also may bite
your ass if you don't stop
trying to aggravate my patient.
I'm gonna leave now,
but I'll be back.
And when I come back,
it'll be with a warrant.
I looked everywhere,
and I thought the conductor
was gonna be so angry.
I kept on searching everywhere,
and finally it was
right on my lap.
Grandma can't wait
to see you.
What'd I do?
First off,
you're carrying a fare
and your meter's not on.
Number two, your license
is not displayed--
-
-
There's laws against
molesting the handicapped,
you know.
Yeah?
I wasn't a pretty sight,
was I?
Thelma told me
about your plans for
your "final transition."
Cop to cop, that subject's
not open to discussion.
Why, would you miss me?
Well, destiny's
what we make it, right?
Touché.
You seem to have
your reasons for checking out.
I just--
I would've expected more
from someone like you.
Well, I might surprise you
and... live forever.
Nothing you could do
would surprise me, Rhyme.
- Look who's still
in the land of the living.
- For the moment.
Promised to return
with a warrant.
Sorry I missed him.
If that's him,
tell him I'm, uh...
Say no more.
Hello? Oh, hey, Paulie.
Hang on.
Linc, I don't know
if this is anything more
than a coincidence,
but a taxi inspector
was killed today by a cabbie
who was off the meter.
Thing about this taxi,
a witness-- a male,
who wouldn't give his name--
saw the taxi speeding away
with an old man
and a little girl inside.
- Probably the doer that called.
- Jesus, he's got a kid.
And an old man.
We better take a closer look
at that third piece
of the puzzle.
Close.
Three murders.
Three evidence clusters.
Three pieces of paper.
View scan.
Come on, Thelma.
You're the queen of puzzles.
What do you see?
I'm looking.
I'm lookin'.
What if we lower
the little one, that one?
Twist that big one around.
Doesn't that kind of
look like a face?
Mouth, nose, eye.
Enhance.
That's a woman's face.
Yes, it is.
An old,
turn-of-the-century...
publisher's logo.
You know it?
I used to own
a few of the books.
Gothic stories.
Crime stories.
Can I help you?
I called before about
turn-of-the-century
crime books.
Around the corner.
Help yourself.
Thanks.
Aviation Two to Central.
We're taking a flyby
at the Brooklyn Bridge.
The report appears
unfounded at this time.
I need more small boats
over here to search
under the piers.
It's by the heliport.
Under the piers.
Lincoln, it was
the last murder in the book.
They've got to be
along the shore here.
Listen.
The lab says the odor
we smelled on the third
piece of the puzzle...
is probably diesel fuel.
There's an old boat
refueling station at
the Staten Island ferry pier.
Check the pilings
under the pier.
Found them!
Over here!
Here! Here!
Central, I can see someone
with a light signaling us...
Subject signaling is most likely
NYPD officer at the site.
Come on.
Over here! Here!
Watch the pilings!
Come over to the ladder.
Central, be advised
aideds are out of the water...
and E.S.U. is working
on them at this time.
Rhyme, you there?
Yeah.
Uh-uh, forget it.
He's dead.
The old man is gone.
Let's try it again.
I know she's still there.
Come on, kid.
Come on. Try it.
She's breathing.
I think she's gonna be okay.
Can you hear me?
Good. Good.
You gotta find the clues
that he left for us, Amelia.
See what you can find
around the fuel tanks.
All right.
Lincoln, I found it.
a "P" and a "B," or a--
P-D. It sounds
like a cop's badge.
You think
he's gonna kill a cop?
Could be.
Thelma.
Maps?
Tell me about the map.
Looks like
an old subway map.
When I was scanning
those asbestos sites,
I came across...
Okay, there it is,
the oldest station.
- It's right next to the pier.
You talking to Rhyme
on that thing?
Give me the radio!
Yeah, listen, Linc.
This is Cheney, man.
What the hell you doin'?
To my understanding,
there's no chain
of evidence voucher.
I'm going to place
your gofer here under arrest.
Lock her up!
Where'd she go?
Hello, Lincoln.
Hello?
Amelia? Hello?
The mobile unit you've called
is not responding,
or is outside
the coverage area.
Recall.
What is it?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
He's gonna kill Rhyme.
Coming.
Hey. What are you
doing here?
Thelma?
Bed mode.
Thelma?
Thelma, is that you?
No, it's me-- Richard.
Richard. What's up?
Thelma asked me to come by,
check the heart pacing machine.
Oh.
Out in the hall.
-
-
Phone mode.
I thought it was time we had
a little quiet moment together,
you and I,
Okay. What's on
your mind, Richard?
I think it's time to set
the record straight,
Mr. Rhyme.
Syracuse.
You remember Syracuse,
don't you?
You wrote
an expert opinion.
I've written thousands
of opinions, Richard.
Don't fucking tell me
you don't remember Syracuse.
Marcus Andrews.
Okay, yeah, that was
the cop that was...
suspected of tampering
with evidence in some
homicide cases, right?
- Nothing was tampered with.
- Six innocent people went
to jail; one hung himself.
No, no, no. They went
to jail because they were
guilty, they were scum.
No, nothing was doctored.
My work was impeccable.
Where we going with this...
Marcus?
Your report
destroyed my life.
You know my report
was not a legal finding.
- You never gave me the
opportunity to defend myself.
- I never even met you.
I was sent to prison
for six years.
I spent two more years
trying to get to you.
Do you know what happens
to a cop in jail?
Every day,
every single day,
over and over,
I was brutalized.
I became a human toilet,
because of your expert opinion.
Well, you will never point
the finger of blame
at anyone ever again.
You were never as good
as they said you were.
I played you.
You and your little helper
couldn't save those people.
Their blood is on your hands.
You failed.
You failed, you fuck.
Game of chess, Mr. Rhyme.
Some people win,
some people lose.
I win, Mr. Rhyme.
I win, you lose.
How about a zucchini?
- You want to be a zucchini?
- Thelma!
Shall we cut out
your tongue, Mr. Rhyme?
How about your eye?
Your eye.
I'll just pop it
right out of there.
No, let's leave that for now...
so you can watch me.
You can watch me
while I gut you open
right down the middle.
What?
What?
What?
Lincoln?
Lincoln.
Can you hear me?
Lincoln.
Oh, God.
I've always loved
this view.
I like it, too, Doc.
It's looking better
every day.
Hey, how you guys doin'?
Good.
Ho-ho, ho, ho, ho-ho!
Ho-ho, ho, ho-ho!
Hey, Linc!
You got an operating
license for that?
I got a learner's permit.
Lincoln.
How's your boyfriend
Morris?
He's in Florida.
He play golf.
Playing golf?
Yo, Paulie.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, everyone.
Linc, if you gonna be cruisin',
you might as well be amusin'.
There you go.
Thank you, Eddie.
It's nice.
Hey.
Come on in.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
You're looking
real good, Mr. Rhyme.
"Mr. Rhyme"?
It's Lincoln to you.
Loosen your shorts.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness!
Merry Christmas.
What are you doing here?
Merry Christmas,
Uncle Linc.
Oh, give me a kiss.
Merry Christmas, Kimmy.
How are you?
How you doin', Tony?
My goodness, I didn't know
you were gonna make this trip.
Wouldn't be a surprise
if you knew.
I'm sorry.
Amelia, this is my sister
Janine, her family.
Amelia.
Yeah, I know. Hi.
You know?
We've met.
On the phone.
How you doin'?
Merry Christmas, Lincoln.
Merry Christmas.
