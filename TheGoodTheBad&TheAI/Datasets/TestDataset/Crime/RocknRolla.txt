That was an unpleasant surprise because
Lenny never happens to that.
You can not get the planes.
It is everything we do.
You can not get both?
What jodieron.
What do you mean by that can not
get the damn planes?
They owe me.
I get the building and you lose
your part.
And yet I am being magnanimous.

to earn a living was very uncomfortable.
You have to find it.
What I do not know is that Lenny controls

And as does the building, wants
your permission.

place than you and you seem more violent.
In the same place that I? ¿Quieres

Excuse the rush, but I have a day
busy.
Sit down.
I can see that we are very similar.
We want things done.
How much is going to cost me?
First let me clarify exactly
how you can benefit
this business.
Without me, I would have to wait 5
to 10 years to get permission to work.
Second, the British Law
A minute.
How much?
I hope to have the assurance that I
awarded in 6 months and without bureaucracy.
Deal, it as fact.

Call the accountant and tell him to wipe
money.

Lenny, you have to do
with cash and for that
you need your personal accountant,
the very talented creative financial
Stella.
