fleet command. Come in. Over.

Danny:
our team executed a
mission to rescue the sailors
We were successful, but
not without losses.
Your brother, Javier, was
among the three brave sailors
This was not the first time
he put himself in harm's way
And I can honestly say that
I'm alive today because of him.
His last thoughts were of
you and his beloved nephews.
And he lives on in the
hearts of those of us
Sir, we've reached Macclesfield Bank,
- bearing 1-6-0.
- Very well.
Keep the islands to the north
and maneuvering options open.
Steer clear of any
bottlenecks if possible.
- Yes, sir. I will.
-
Captain on the bridge.
My "take it easy"
speeches never worked on you.
Now I get it.
And the others?
They're taking the time they need.
Kumonosu Island is 45
nautical miles in our rear view mirror.
We're heading
south-southeast at 25 knots.
Still operating at EMCON Alpha One.
They must've been hiding
on the northeast
side of Takehaya's Island.
We know what kind of ship?
Peng has four guided missile destroyers.
We need to let POTUS
know you're all alive
and back on the ship.
But first, we need to get far
enough away from the Chinese
so they don't track our broadcast
and blow us out of the water.
So we move as fast as possible.
And our new houseguest?
Doc Rios just pulled a
bullet out of his arm.
When he's ready, we'll talk.
Attention in the pilot house.
This is Captain Chandler.
Captain Slattery has the ship.
-  -
--  --
Good.
You're awake.
-
- And alive...
thanks to the people you tortured.
Your pirates arrived in
Vietnam on three ships.
Should I be expecting a rescue attempt?
How did you know to find my
people at that nightclub?
Who you working with?
Captain...
you are a prisoner on this ship...
You and your wife.
What else do you want?
It is over.
You poisoned my
country. You killed us all.
- You know who I am.
- I know what I know.
Then know this...
You captured and
tortured the very individuals
who would've helped
you and your country...
- the sailors who brought Asia the cure.
- That was no cure!
While aboard this ship,
you are protected by
the Geneva Convention
and by the humanity
of Captain Mike Slattery and this crew.
But make no mistake, when
we reach the States,
you will be charged with war crimes
and prosecuted to the
fullest extent of the law.
I will be dead by then.

Sailor.
Sailor.
How's she doing?
I have to be judicious
with the antimalarial treatment
because of her pregnancy.
- Did you test her blood?
- Yes, sir.
Both Kyoko and her husband
have the virus and the
cure in their bloodstream.
- The cure is just not working.
- Then you need to run more tests.
Sir, now that Dr. Scott's
lab is broken down,
I don't have the equipment
to do extensive blood work.
And even if I did...
I'm not Dr. Scott.
Just do what you can.
Yes, sir.
TAO, EW surface contact on passive.
Bearing approximately 0-2-0.
- How far?
- Based on signal strength, it's close.
Could be 10, 15 miles.
Bridge, CIC.
EW's detecting a
radar signal at 0-2-0.
- We should have a visual.
- Lookouts?
-
- Surface lookouts be advised.
Passive radar reports contact
bearing approximately 0-2-0.
Requesting reports.
We have an ID on our radar?
- Definitely military.
- That's one of Peng's.
We're picking up their
radar intermittently.
It's bleeding through the
surrounding islands.
As soon as they get a direct line,
they're gonna lock on
us with fire control.
Bridge? CIC.
Recommend adjusting course to
stay within this island chain.
- OOD, make course 1-4-0.
- OOD, aye. Helm, make course 1-4-0.
Lookout reports no
contacts down that bearing.
A signal that powerful,
why can't we see the
ship on the horizon?
Because it's not one ship.
Instead of one strong signal close by,
it's four normal signals further out.
Peng sent his entire fleet.
Go dark.
Darken
ship. Darken ship.
All non-essential equipment off.
Decks clear of non-essential personnel.
Darken ship. Darken ship.
Alisha: We are clear, I say again.
Bravo contact is no longer pinging us
on their navigational radar.
Gator: Charlie's still sweeping
us on our starboard.
We're at 23 seconds.
Charlie contact is
strong, bearing drift to port.
Alisha: I copy.
Chandler: Finding your
bearings, Miss Cooper?
Tom?
Give it a minute. Your eyes will adjust.
Stand here.
Slattery: First time on a darkened ship?
I thought you said she was Navy, Tom.
Sasha: Naval
intelligence doesn't spend much time
on small-boys. Captain Slattery?
Slattery:
Gator, where are they?
Gator: All four contacts
are north of our position, sir.
Alisha: Still nothing
from Alpha or Bravo.
Chandler: The four Chinese
ships are spreading out,
looking for us. So far,
we've done a good job
dodging in and out of their radar sweeps
using the island
chain to mask ourselves.
- They haven't IDed us yet.
- Gator: OOD, recommend course...
There you are. Now you can see me.
Gator: 30 seconds since last contact.
Sasha: So then what's the plan? We hide.
Right now, our best
offense is a good defense.
Hence the darkness.
Hence the darkness.
TAO, new surface
contact on passive radar.
This looks to be... yes,
this must be Delta.
I can't believe they don't see us.
They see us. They just don't know it.
Delta contact, bearing 0-0-2 confirmed.
This is another Luyang
III Class Destroyer.
Hard left rudder, steady
course 0-9-0. Speed 6 knots.
Alisha: Aye, sir. Helmsman,
come to course 0-9-0.
They're converging on us.
Three ships still hitting us.
If we can get around this island,
we'll be completely masked.
We're losing ground cover on the turn.
Increase to 12 knots.
Gator: Aye. Increasing
speed to 12 knots.
Delta fading.
Fading.
We're clear. No longer being
hit by any navigational radar.
Gator: We've got island cover.
Bring up the red lights.
reporting live from the
St. Louis courthouse.
- Hail them again.
- U.S.S. Nathan James,
this is fleet command hailing
you on Navy Red. Over.
President Jeffrey
Michener has vowed to dedicate
every available
resource to the swift rescue...
See, this is the same kind of
interference Val was getting.
Do you think that's
why they're not answering?
It comes and it goes and
it screws up our video feed,
but the audio channel, that stays clear.
the hell are they?
Sir, Shackelton and Haywa are a day away
from the James's last known coordinates.
- We've sent them the latest intel...
- Another day.
- Try 'em again.
- Yes, sir.
Dennis:
this is fleet command hailing
you on Navy Red. Over.
Please. Sit.
We tested your blood.
Yours and your wife's.
The cure that runs through
your veins is the very same
as the one that runs through mine,
except for some reason,
it's not working on you.
Until Doc Rios can
get his new lab running,
we won't know why.
So... here I am again.
I want details about what happened
after you received the cure.
You can keep fighting
us, thinking we're monsters,
or you can cooperate,
help us figure out what went
wrong and how to fix it.
I heard the call over the radio.
The Americans are coming with the cure.
We rushed to the port, thousands of us.
Survivors.
The ships arrived.
American ships.
And we lined up to
receive our injections.
They told us to spread out,
to pass the cure on to
the rest of our people.
Soon...
there was no way to tell
who had the cure and who did not....
because everyone died.
But other than the U.S. Navy,
who had custody of the
cargo once it landed?
Could someone have tampered
with the doses on the pier?
No. How can you be so sure?
We delivered to dozens of
countries on this ship.
We always worked with
the local partners...
I was a local partner, Captain.
My crew was there.
We'd made sure everyone received a dose.
I was in charge.
I was responsible.
That's why you wanted those
ships out of Okinawa.
That's why you
wanted to punish the people
that brought you the cure.
But why work with Peng?
I did not work with Peng. Oh, come on.
The coincidence is too great.
You kidnapped my men in Hai Phong
at precisely the same moment
Peng blows up my plane in Hong Kong?
I do not call that coincidence, Captain.
I call that luck.
I'd like to have a moment
alone with my client, please.
If you need anything, I'm
right outside the door.
- Mr. Curtis...
- You ain't my lawyer.
No, sir. I'm not. I'm a reporter.
For the murder of Dr. Rachel Scott,
you were given a military tribunal,
so the case was sealed.
Nobody's ever really
gotten a chance to hear
your end of the story.
What do you wanna know?
-
- About your time...
-
- with the Immune Army.
More specifically, your interactions
with now-President Jeffrey Michener.
Ain't you gonna call "action"?
Jacob: Did he tell you
he was the President?
- Did he even know?
- Curtis: No.
We didn't know he was President
when we met him.
- About what?
- About killing all those
He was Secretary of HUD.
He set up the quarantine.
And after that, that
virus tore through the state
walking around like a
zombie, ranting and raving.
Mr. President, these
documents clearly show
that you authorized to
have your son transported
from a known hot zone in
Michigan down to Florida.
It's public record.
The outbreak in Ann
Arbor started after Brian left.
Two days after. And the
travel ban was already in effect.
- You knew the risk you were taking.
- No, listen to me, Jacob.
The quarantine in the
stadium was porous.
Dozens of infected people could and did
get through the defenses.
That's true, sir,
but it appears that
isn't the way you saw it.
You believe that you
were responsible for the death
of tens of thousands of people.
And if that was your mental condition
when Captain Chandler found you,
then what was your condition when
you took the oath of office
a mere 11 days later?
I take no pleasure in this, sir.
No, you come into my
office and rehash this garbage?
But the American people need to know
if their Commander
in Chief is capable...
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Get out!
Shaw: Jeffrey, please. Jacob.
- Now.
- This time, we're on the record.
- So if I should know something else...
- Out!
Now, Jacob. Now, Jacob.
-
- Is this true?
Maybe we just
delivered a bad batch to Japan.
- It spoiled in transit or...
- Unlikely.
I've been delivering the
cure all over the world.
This has never happened before.
Well, there's no reason to
take the word of a pirate
who captured,
tortured, and killed your men.
We have his blood, Sasha.
The cure clearly didn't work on him.
Something happened in Japan.
Well, then maybe it
was a mutation after all.
Okay, I know Dr. Scott said
that the virus cannot mutate.
You've been very clear about that.
But with no other explanation,
isn't it possible that
in this one instance
Dr. Scott was wrong?
All hands, man your battle
stations.
-
- What do you got?
We're surrounded, sir.
Two ships on either side
painting us with navigational radar.
Damn it. They used our time in
the islands to set a perimeter.
- Sasha: So we go dark again?
- Negative.
They see a speck of
light on the horizon,
we can't suddenly
disappear. They can both see us.
They've gotta have
us triangulated by now.
CIC, Bridge.
Be ready to fire
down known bearing lines.
Ready all fire stations. All
stations manned and ready.
Standing by for batteries release.
Two ships. Where are the other two?
Prepare to break EMCOM,
find targeting solutions.
- Aye, sir.
- They're hailing us, sir.
Which ship?
The transmission's not in English.
It's an ID.
Hull number 172...
holding at 15 knots.
- That's the one to our east.
- CIC, Bridge. We have a location.
Get me fire targeting
options, but do not go active.
They still haven't painted
us with their fire control, sir.
What are they waiting for?
They're asking for us to report in.
Wait, hold on. This
is a different voice.
Hull number 87...
Second ship? Currently at 12 knots.
Also asking for a report.
From who?
- From us.
-
Chinese 172 thinks we're Chinese 87,
and 87 thinks we're 172. Not
for long. They're closing in.
Soon they'll be in range of each other
- and they'll know who we are.
- We gotta disappear. Fast.
There's a pass up
ahead. We can use it as a mask.
We head to the pass and
come to full stop.
When they get to the other
side, we won't be there.
You heard the man.
Garnett: How long
until they see each other?
They maintain current
course and speed...
Then they both shoot to kill.
Gator: 30 seconds till
we make it to the pass.
You're the only one here who
speaks Chinese. Answer 'em.
Both of them can hear us. Which
ship am I supposed to be?
Just gotta buy some
time to get in the pass.
- I'll do it.
- Gator: 20 seconds!
-
-
-
- 172 to 87...
your last was garbled.
Say again. Over.
- 87 to 172, please say again.
This won't hold them
off for long. Gator!
- 9...
Come on.
We made it to the pass.
All stop! All stop!
repeat bearing and speed.
Do you copy?
- They're not giving up.
And they're not going away.
Michener:
How the hell did this happen?
Brian:

Girl:
-
My fellow Americans,
by now, many of you heard
about the reports from Florida
and my time spent there.
I wanted to take a moment
to tell you the truth directly from me.
was the carrier of
the red flu at the time.
from an area that I knew
could be infected.
But as a public servant,
I was derelict in my duties.
Since the release of that
statement an hour ago,
St. Louis White House
remains on virtual lockdown,
with no comments from his
aides and no further information
I will continue to pursue
this story wherever it leads.

- Doc? Doc.
Oh, no. What... what's happening?
Her heart rate's elevated. Her
blood pressure's dumping.
This baby's in distress. We
need to deliver it right away.
Logan, I need to
start an epidural right now!
- Yes, sir.
- Ma'am, we need help.
I need you to find anyone with any kind
of surgical experience
on this ship now. Go!
Okay.
Is Doc aware just how unqualified I am?
- I mean, I can pack a wound.
- He needs more hands.
Outside of medical,
you're the closest
thing to a surgeon we've got.
Let's go.
_
_
- Rios: Clamp.
-
I-I need clamps.
Yeah.
Put it in my hand.
Good.
Dissect the tissue.
Go ahead. Both hands.
- _
- That's good. Just like that.
- Oh, shit.
- What?
It's okay, it's okay. The
fetal membrane's already ruptured.
We need to move quickly.
- Irrigate. Suction.
- Logan: Yes, sir.
That's better.
- Is that good?
- Very good.
Okay, we're clear. Thank you.
Okay. I visualize the fetal head.
I see the fetal head.
Apply pressure to the
abdomen. Prepare to deliver.
As soon as the baby's delivered,
he'll be exposed to your wife's virus.
You need to decide if you want
us to give him the cure.
I can't force you to trust me.
But as a father,
I'm telling you,
it's the right thing to do.
Extracting the fetal head now.
- Okay.
-
Good, good, good,
good. Just like that. Okay.
- Support the head and neck.
- Yeah.
It's a boy.
It's not responsive. Okay,
set it down. Agitate its feet.
Just pinch it. Tickle
it. Logan, suction. Now.
Okay.
-
- Danny:  Come on.
Okay.
- I'm gonna cut the umbilical cord, okay?
-
I got you. I got you. I got you.
Here we go.
- Hi.
-
Give him the cure.
Please.
- Kyoko...
-

Kaito.
The Chinese are likely employing
a standard line abreast search pattern
with spacing at 80%
of their radar range.
That's right.
My guess is they'll
circle back from open water
and close in on us hiding in the pass.
And it won't be
long before they find us.
Soon as the sun rises, we'll
be completely exposed.
So then what are our options?
Only one.
Take on all four ships.
Wait till their search pattern
brings them back in range,
then break EMCOM and go active.
Target, fire, get the
hell out of the way.
We'll hit them, but there's no
way they won't hit us back.
Well, if it comes to a
fight, we'll sink 'em all.
Cameron: At the first
hit on passive radar,
the helo and RHIB will
launch simultaneously,
each one heading 180
degrees from our course,
blasting surface
radar to confuse the enemy.
DC Central will be
posted at all zebra boundaries.
First order of business...
report and repair any
damage due to missile attack.
Immediately seal all compartments
whose condition threatens the
integrity of this vessel.
On my mark, we will break
EMCOM and energize spy radar.
We will have no more than
each enemy ship.
- Are we ready?
- All: Yes, ma'am.
Then let's do it how they trained us.
Captain, if I'm not mistaken,
your ship is currently positioned
in the Jinhshan Pass.
You have evaded the
Chinese for the moment,
but soon, they will have you surrounded.
You intend to fight them all at once?
I have a better plan,
but we must hurry.
CNO on the Bridge. Captain
on the Bridge.
This is the safest way out
of this island group.
You're certain?
OOD, come to course
Aye, sir. Helm, make
course 1-2-5, all ahead flank.
Aye, sir.
TAO, Surface, reporting two...
correction, we have three,
say again, three contacts on passive.
Bridge, CIC, we're surrounded again.
Slick 32 has three
vessels on passive radar.
Sir, I recommend we head due south
to the Zhulong Atoll for protection.
This was part of the plan, I take it?
Maintain course and speed.
Keep her so.
Gator: Sir, we are
heading directly into open water.
Once they have a clear path,
they can triangulate and
fire on us almost immediately.
I strongly recommend we set course 0-5-5.
Considered.
CIC detects the fourth
ship on passive, sir.
- They engage fire control?
- Negative, sir.
Prepare countermeasures.
Stop. Stop engines!
All stop.
Engage Kingfisher.
You put us in a minefield.
They're everywhere.
All four targets are converging
on us, sir. We cannot turn back.
This is my minefield.
I designed it.
I know how those mines operate.
I can steer us to safety.
There is no other option.
Surrender the helm.
Man: Aye, sir.
Okay.
Oh, that was close.
Sir, Chinese vessels are converging.
Gator: They can have us
targeted in 30 seconds, sir.
Man fire stations.
Set condition ZEBRA about the ship.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, easy.
Okay, there... there's
two on your port side.
Okay.
Alisha: 15 seconds to triangulation.
Now this one's tethered.
Oh, God. Jesus.
We're clear!
Surrender the helm.
Alisha: Five seconds. Five
seconds to triangulation.
Hard right rudder! All ahead flank!
Gator: Hard right rudder.
All ahead flank, aye.
-
- Fire control radar detected.
They're behind us! Prepare
to deploy countermeasures.
CIC, break EMCOM. Energize SPY,
Aegis doctrine on. Prepare to intercept.
SPY is energized. High power.
Aegis doctrine on. Ready VLS.
Switching to SONAR. CSC,
set salvo size at 2.
CIC, I wanna know when they fire.
Woman: Ready, all fire stations?
Man: All stations manned and ready.
Standing by for batteries release.
Sir, CIC reports detonations.
At least one ship has
been struck in the minefield.
Enemy fire control radars are off.
Three remaining ships are diverting.
Very well. Reset to
condition EMCOM ALPHA ONE.
Thank you, sir.
Kara?
How's little Frankie?
He's...
he's doing very well, sir.
Thank you for asking.
Good. That's, uh, that's good.
Enjoy every minute with him.
Your boy shows no sign of a virus.
Cure works.
Though we still can't
explain the outbreak in Japan.
Doc Rios is rebuilding our lab.
Hopefully, he'll make
progress on that front.
I don't know how to thank you
or how to make things right
after all I have done to you.
You can start by
explaining your connection to Peng.
- He hire you directly?
- It was not Peng.
Captain...
The MSS who showed up on your island
went after my men and yours.
Peng set you up,
tried to wipe us both out.
I was told how to find
you in Vietnam by a smuggler.
And what was his cut of a
bunch of American sailors?
Just a promise
that I would not pirate certain ships.
Ones marked...
like this.
What's so special about those ships?
I did not care to ask.
At the time,
all I wanted was revenge.
This smuggler have a name?
Wu Ming.
Ring a bell?
He has my watch.
I know where to find him...
a place called Shanzhai.
We clear to broadcast?
EMCON Alpha has been lifted.
You have St. Louis.
Stand by for CNO.
This is CNO.
We got him.
- I need to see the President.
- Sorry, ma'am, no visitors tonight.
He's not answering his phone.
I have word from Nathan James.
Those are our orders. I'm sorry.
Agent Costas, I am the
Deputy Chief of Staff
and I am issuing you a direct order.
Open this door.

- Mr. President?
