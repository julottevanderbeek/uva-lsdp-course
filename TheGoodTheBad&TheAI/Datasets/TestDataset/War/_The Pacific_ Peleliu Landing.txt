After four months of fierce
jungle combat,
Were withdrawn from
cape gloucester.
Veteran #1: We were absolutely certain
we were going to go back
But no, we ended up on
an island called pavuvu.
Hanks: Pavuvu, part of the
Solomon island chain,
Once a thriving coconut
plantation,
It was abandoned when the
war broke out.
The guy that picked that out,
he sure didn't know what he was doing.
It was the nastiest,
dirtiest looking place under the sun.
All kinds of things
just grew in profusion,
Especially the rat population.
The land crabs would
come out at night
And you could hear them
clackity-clacking and clicking around.
And they would get
into your shoes.
Veteran #5: A lot of
training started.
And it seemed to get
heavier and heavier,
So you knew we were gonna go
somewhere into combat.
The 1st division shipped
out again
Headed for a small coral island beten
Guam and the Philippines...
Only six miles long and
two miles wide,
That was close to the
philippine islands.
Was critical to retaking
the Philippines
As a stepping stone
to the invasion
The Navy bombarded peleliu
for three days
The men were told that the fighting
would last only a few days.
As any island invasion
of world war ii.
Veteran #4: I don't think you could
train for anything like that.
And it didn't cease.
It was... it was a nightmare.
Puller: For you are about to be
awarded the medal of honor.
Selling U.S. War bonds
is just as important
As what you did on guadalcanal.
Now pack your seabag. You're going home.
Home?
I'm enlisting tomorrow.
I'd do it tonight
if they were open.
Eugene... - I don't need
your permission, father.
"dear vera, we haven't seen a
jap for two weeks now.
They got smart and got the hell out
of this godforsaken spot.
Now our enemy is the
jungle itself.
All you need is a week or two.
That should do the trick.
They got a hospital
over on banika.
I'm gonna pull some paper and you'll
be on your way in an hour.
Why am I in with guys who need to
have their razor blades taken away?
Most of the guys that come
through here are simply...
Tired.
My guess is you fall
into that category.
Hey, you're a dead man,
you know it!
-
- go get Dr. Grant!
This isn't the right place for me.
I'm rested, I'm fit.
I want to return to my
unit and my friends.
I hope it's quick and
easy for you, leckie.
No worries about
ending up like me.
-
- man: Big smile, miss Grey!
- How's that, fellas?
- You look beautiful, Virginia.
When do we say, "back the attack"?
Every chance you get!
Now the kiss on the cheek
and we gotta go!
Hold that!
This is a shortcut.
That's Virginia Grey.
Hey, excuse me.
I don't believe this.
You're John Basilone.
I'm gonna be in the marine corps.
It's a fine branch
of our armed forces.
I re... report next Tuesday.
Boot camp's a breeze.
You get to sleep in on mondays.
What else?
You coming?
Uh, keep your head
down and keep moving.
Look down, keep moving.
Listen to your n.C.O.S.
Thanks. What's an "n. C.O."?
- You handle it well.
- Handle what well?
Membership in the
famous people's club.
Just don't be surprised if
it's not quite what you expect.
Go on stage,
Say "back the attack" a
couple hundred times,
Get my picture took-
there's not much to it.
You have no idea
what's coming at you.
Better keep your head down.
Basilone: What kind of
message is that?
- Whoo.
- Wow.
My kid brother comes to visit me.
Am I allowed to even speak
to you without saluting,
- Sergeant Basilone?
- Shut up, you jerk.
You know I work for a living.
Early morning, sergeant Basilone.
'Morning, Al. Hey,
how did they let this palooka
Into a classy joint
like the biltmore?
This is my brother George, al.
Can I get you some coffee,
sir? - Please.
Hey, how about some breakfast?
I got a train to catch at 0717.
No no, al can swing it. Right, al?
Breakfast? Absolutely.
One of us has to go
back to the marines.
Pendleton agreeing with you?
Paradise by the sea.
Virginia Grey agreeing with you?
Hey, don't you be thinkin' about her.
She's in good hands.
Yeah, but is she in
the best of hands?
Sit down!
Here we are, gentlemen.
- Thanks, al.
- You're welcome.
Giovanni, you're everywhere.
Yeah, they keep me running.
Listen to this: 0900 I got a
meeting with the governor,
Then a rally at a
plant in glendale.
Tonight some big deal at
the Hollywood canteen.
I had a six-hour pass.
I go to the movies
And who shows up in the newsreel?
You, mom, pa, and most of new
Jersey at John Basilone day.
That was crazy.
Don't slug me,
but can I ask you a question?
Take your chances.
How scary was it... guadalcanal?
I hope I don't freeze up
or make a mistake, is all.
- I hope I can be as...
- George.
Don't feel like you
need to prove nothin'.
You know what I mean?
- No, I...
- do you know what I mean?
Yeah.
Looks like Hawaii.
No, it doesn't.
Hey, sledge, leyden,
what are you doing?
Looking at land, oswalt.
Man over p.A.: Attention, all hands,
make way to debark station.
Make all preparations to offload
personnel and cargo.
Man: Here we go.
Get your gear squared away.
Lookin' for how company.
- This how company?
- Two in.
No.
-
- damn.
Man: I could have told you.
I fuckin' warned you, you fuck.
What? Huh? Yeah.
Take that, you fuckin' jap!
And recover.
Hello.
We're supposed to be in 60 mortars,
second squad.
Jesus, these guys are
supposed to be 60 mortars.
This is second squad.
- Robert oswalt.
- Eugene sledge.
You mortars too?
Riflemen, third platoon.
Bill leyden.
- Then we'll ignore you.
-
- That's snafu.
-
That man's de l'eau and I'm
corporal burgin.
Find yourself a bunk.
Taken.
Taken.
Come on, I'll show you around,
Find you another tent.
Let's go.
This is where they dry-dock us
when we're not killing japs.
- Over there is chow...
- Man: Move it!
...Heads,
King company skipper,
Captain haldane.
- What's your name?
- De l'eau.
D-e...
L'e-a-u, de l'eau.
Jay de l'eau.
Were you in guadalcanal?
Gloucester. G-l...
Grab a rack in that
second tent over there.
Thanks.
Oh, you know where I
could find how company?
Somewhere over there.
- Wanna get some chow?
- Been waiting for it.
- Ho ho ho.
- Runner: We know this guy?
Mug's ugly enough
to ring a few bells.
Gloucester,
maybe? Was it gloucester?
- Chuckler: Was it gloucester?
- Was he on gloucester?
- He may have been on gloucester.
- He looks familiar.
Maybe he was on gloucester.
- I don't know. He's ugly.
- Fuck you all.
Looks like a land crab that
once crawled up my pee hole.
Hey, welcome home, cobber.
You have a good vacation?
Anything to get away
from you bastards.
We're not so lucky.
Oh, jeez!
- Ho, there you go.
-
What's in this?
When it tastes this bad,
it's hard to tell.
What you got?
Pens. Tell Santa whether
you been naughty or nice.
Naughty. The naughtiest.
- It's June.
- It's the South pacific.
Christmas comes in June.
For hoosier...
'cause he's always saying his prayers,
making his bed.
- Aw!
- All: Awww!
- Look at that.
- That's beautiful.
- Chuckler?
- Yes?
- Thank you.
- Heavier reading.
- With pictures.
- Here you go.
Oh, I read this already.
I don't believe it.
Oh!
Something's wrong.
Something's very wrong if you
made it through boot camp.
Give me a break, you old greaser!
Haldane: Get up off my deck.
- Captain haldane.
- Sir.
What's this about, marine?
Some rite of greeting new to the corps?
Yes, sir. Um, I mean, no, sir.
- Who are you?
- Private Eugene sledge, sir.
You fellas know each other or is this
some kind of conflict resolution?
Old friends, sir.
Mobile, Alabama, sir.
- Mobile?
- Yes, sir.
- Old friends, huh?
- That explains it.
As you were.
But try not to dislocate a
shoulder or break an arm.
We need both you men healthy.
- Sir.
- Sir.
Carry on.
Get me in hot water
on the first day.
Yeah, well, you deserve it!
Welcome to paradise.
Sledge: How do you get used to
the smell around here?
Think this shitheap stinks now,
You should have seen it
when we first got here.
It was wall-to-wall rats,
crabs and rotten coconuts.
Thank God I'm rotating home.
I can't believe I finally
get here and you go home.
When you leavin'?
When the marine corps tells me.
- What's your unit?
- K-3-5.
- A mortarman, just like you.
-
Whoo-hoo!
Hallelujah.
The health of the corps
Is only as strong
As the health of the
individual marine.
Marines will make every effort
to keep themselves clean.
- Hey!
- Ahh!
Hey, don't you quit on me, fucker!
- You gotta be kidding!
- Not till I've rinsed.
Phillips: They get hot chow
to you when they can.
You know, it might
only be crud like this,
But when you been on
the line taking fire,
Hot chow is a miracle.
- Oh, for heaven's sake.
- What is that, baby food?
You know, you laugh... you laugh,
But that might be worth its
weight in gold someday.
You get hungry enough,
somebody'll want to trade for it.
You do not trade this... Ever.
.45 will stop a jap better
than a clip of your carbine.
You hit one of the suckers
in the hand with that,
Heh, take his arm right off.
You can write your father a
nice thank-you note for that.
Working party... three of
you boots go with snafu.
Hurry up!
You heard the sergeant... Now!
You don't mind, do you, leyden?
You assholes are gonna miss cleaning
out oil barrels pretty soon.
You're gonna be humping
up some fucking hill...
Or across a beach,
Japs pouring shit for fire,
Pissing your pants,
crying "boo hoo,"
And wishing you were back
here with nothing asked of you
But to scrub oil out of drums.
Why don't you grab a brush
And give us a hand?
Fuck that shit.
I scrub drums for no man.
Can we take a break?
Do whatever you want.
This ain't my detail.
I was supposed to dump you all off here,
then report back to the c.P.
Then why are you still here?
I like to watch the
new guys sweat.
Ahh! Are those the
most butt-ugly creatures
You ever saw before in your life?
Jesus, sid.
When you start pulling them out
of your hooch in the morning,
You won't feel so tenderhearted.
Lost mine in the polk.
Or somebody took it. Maybe one of
the swabbies wanted a souvenir.
Yeah?
Some of the guys think
they're good luck.
I don't know.
You can have this one.
I got a couple.
Here.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
Sid?
What's it like?
I slept with a woman in Melbourne.
I'm not bragging.
But that's at one end, right?
And then way down there
as far as you can go...
And that's what it's like.
And that...
That you could never imagine.
Okay.
I'm gonna miss you, sid.
You'll be all right.
Woman in movie: Are you
angry about mething?
I won't cry.
Dear Christ in heaven,
would you look at her?
I don't know how to kiss
or I would kiss you.
Where do the noses go?
-
- man: There we go!
What are you waiting for?
Fuck her.
Think she's blonde down there?
Cease fire on the firing line!
You stupid, goddamn
shavetail son of a bitch!
You keep your fucking
weapon pointed downrange
Or I will shove that fuckin'
piece up your sorry fucking ass.
Don't look at me, lieutenant.
The gunny's right.
You seen Phillips?
I believe the angels
are shipping out.
You might catch them
back down at the docks.
Leckie: Sid was my best customer.
When you've finished,
please return it
To the pacific
library of congress.
Kipling. Always good.
Most of these jokers can't read.
Have you heard the latest
about the other war?
There's another war?
We invaded Europe.
Landed last month in France.
Hell, unless you got a brother over there,
most guys don't give a shit.
My brother landed in Italy,
Well, I guess you
get to give a shit.
Just coffee, thanks.
That explains it.
You're a believer.
Yes.
Okay, question:
God created everything, right?
The heavens, the seven seas,
the marine corps...
Even him.
...Land crabs, rats, mosquitoes.
The mosquitoes are a little tough
to understand, I guess, but...
God created japs too, right...
Yellow slants who have tried
to kill me on many occasions?
Japs come from the
garden of eden too?
Well, what we do is up to us.
Free will. Right.
Except he's God, of course, so he knows
what we're gonna do before we do it.
Predestination.
So the whole game is fixed by
the will of gramps on his throne
While we're down here for what?
His entertainment? That makes
us chumps and God's a sadist.
And either way I
got no use for him.
So what do you believe in?
I believe in ammunition.
Since I'm not on speaking
terms with him anymore,
Next time you're having a
chat with the old geezer,
Can you ask him to sink
a few jap transports
And have them all
fall on their bayonets
So I can get the fuck
out of here and go home?
I sure would appreciate it.
You go ahead and keep it.
I don't know why I have
it in the first place.
No, thanks.
I've got my own.
Follow the man in front of you
And get off that beach.
And when you get to the tree line,
remember to clear your weapons of sand.
- Aye, sir.
- Mortarmen...
- Here you go, marine.
- Thank you, sir.
Haldane:...Make sure you have four h.
E. Rounds set for fire.
Good luck. God bless.
Man: You heard the skipper!
Get your gear on. Move!
Let's get it done, Eugene.
Man: Get inside! Easy easy!
Get inside.
- Good luck, sledge.
- Thank you, sir.
Sergeant.
I don't smoke.
Yeah?
Here we go, boys!
Stay the fuck down!
...My trespasses...
Haldane: Fire! Open fire!
Load and lock, gentlemen!
Haldane: Here we go! Let's go,
let's go!
Move move move! Go go go!
Move out!
Let's move out!
Let's go! Move out!
-
- Ahh!
Keep moving! Keep it moving!
- Go go go!
-
Haldane: Sledge, get on the beach!
Let's make a move!
I'm bleeding out!
I'm bleeding out!
Let's go! Open fire!
-
- get up, get up, get up!
Ahh!
Man: Corpsman!
Marine! Let's go this way!
Ahh!
Man: Hold the mortars down!
Hold the mortars!
Easy on the water.
Easy on the water
Where the hell is love company?
- Is this 3/7?
- No, 3/5!
Well, where the hell
is the 7th marines?
You're on orange beach 3!
Goddamn cocksucking
son of a bitch.
Ahh!
Sledge! Sledge, you gotta...
They got us bracketed.
We gotta move!
Let's go! Get your
ass out of this hole!
We gotta move!
Move! Get up there!
Sledge, God damn it, you gotta get
your ass out of that hole right now!
Move it! Move forward.
Join your squad!
Move!
Aw, fuck!
We gotta get off the beach!
I know!
- Leckie, you gotta move!
- Leave me the fuck alone!
Keep 'em here, gunny.
I gotta find second platoon.
- Aye aye, sir.
- Hillbilly!
You're with me.
Bring a runner. Let's go!
You, let's go!
- "k" company?
- Part of it.
You're supposed to hook up
with the rest of the battalion
In the Southern edge of the airfield,
in the brushline.
Got it.
You guys got any water?
No, we ain't got
any fucking water.
Southern edge of the airfield.
Everybody take another salt pill.
Gunny, bring them up here.
Do it later! We gotta move!
Let's go!
- Keep moving!
- Ahh!
- Ahh!
- Oh, fuck!
Oh, bill. Bill.
Dropped my fucking weapon.
Corpsman! Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Hey, everything's
gonna be fine. Bill!
It ain't shit.
Everything's gonna be fine.
It ain't shit.
Damn it! Corpsman!
There you are, God damn it!
Pressure! Pressure!
- Sorry.
- What?
Bill? - Corpsman:
Help me carry him back.
Bill?
Bill?
Bill?
Son of a bitch.
Those are jap tanks.
Mortars! Get me some h.E.
On those sons of bitches!
- Now! Let's go, let's go.
- You heard the lieutenant.
Let's go! Move out!
Hold here, hold here!
Burgin: 250... three rounds, h.E.!
Hot load!
- Hanging!
- Snafu: Fire!
- Hanging!
- Fire!
Drop 2-5.
- Hanging!
- Fire!
- Ahh!
- Hot load!
- Hanging!
- Fire!
- Hanging!
- Fire!
Round's complete.
Fall back 50 and dig in!
- Let's go!
- Oh, shit.
- Shit!
- Fall back!
Fuck!
-
- man: Spread out! Spread out!
Chuckler. Chuckler.
You see chuckler or runner?
Who?
Juergins or conley? H-2-1?
Never heard of them.
Man: Lieutenant wants us up front.
Let's go!
Leckie! Leckie!
Runner!
- Are you okay?
- Thirsty.
Hoosier got hit.
You going asiatic?
Feet are soaking wet.
What you gonna do in
your stockin' feet
When the fucking japs
bust through the line?
-
- Get back! Take cover!
You men got enough ammo?
Perimeter's 30yds
out from your hole.
L.P.'s out beyond that.
One man awake at all times.
Lilliputian?
Hard for the japs to say.
Hard for me to say.
Trade you.
Shit, I forgot about that guy.
We're rich, boys.
Jap's got a shitload
of gold in his teeth.
Take the first watch.
Wake me up in four hours.
Anything moves, kill it.
Look at that.
You ever been to the grand canyon?
No.
My dad went when he was a boy.
He was always going on
about it when I was little.
I'd ask him about it.
He said I had to see it to understand.
We got there late at night
to these cabins.
Couldn't see a thing on
account of the dark.
Went outside...
the fucking grand canyon.
A mile down, colors I'd
never seen before.
My dad was right:
Pictures don't show it.
You have to be there
Looking down into it.
Shut the fuck up, you idiot.
We have to go out there tomorrow.
