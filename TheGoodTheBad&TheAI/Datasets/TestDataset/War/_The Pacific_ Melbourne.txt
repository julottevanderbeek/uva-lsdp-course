Woman:
Heroes! Heroes!
Man:
Welcome to Australia, mates.
What the hell is this?
Well done.
Well done.
Yay for the Yankees.
- Yay!
- Welcome down under.
Woman:
G'day, handsome.
We love you.
Man:
G'day there, mate.
Do you believe this?
Woman:
We love you!
We love you!
How many Japs
you kill, Yank?
You kill many Japs?
Killed any Japs?
Let's go.
Disembark the truck.
Find your company areas.
Where are we?
Man:
Keep moving.
Make sure you got
all your gear.
Find your area.
Keep moving
all the way through.
Let's go.
Find your areas.
Make sure to store
those M1 rifles now!
Andrews, you're on mess.
Move it.
It ain't no Wrigley Field.
Man on P. A:
Attention in the area.
Attention in the area.
All arriving personnel,
this is your billeting area.
You will be directed
by your company.
Officer: First squad, let's go.
Grab those packs.
Oh, the hell with this.
I'm gonna sleep for a few days.
Better take
a look at this.
The MPs
are just giving up.
Phillips:
Can they do that?
Everyone's going AWOL.
Nobody's stopping them.
Oh, I've got to be
a part of this.
- Marine: Whoo, freedom!
- All right.
Marine:
Melbourne here we come.
Let's hit the streets.
Hey, buddy, rest up.
All right?
Mmm.
Have something.
It's like St. Mark's
on Woodward.
All Saints
on North Hermitage.
It's as pure as every
church bell that ever rang.
Straight ahead.
Give it a try.
- It's wonderful.
- Sorry, excuse me.
The beers?
Here, here and here.
Whiskey,
rum,
vodka,
rye,
brandy,
Bourbon
and vermouth.
And you call that?
A Blockbuster.
You're sure gonna be
trouble tonight, cobber.
- Here you go, Manny.
- To Manny.
Never thought you'd
down that, mate.
Right now we could
down anything.
Aren't you supposed to be
in Africa fighting Rommel?
Somebody has to keep
the peace at home,
let you Yanks
get your proper R&R.
Quite a lot of you here now.
Just arrived today?
- Must be thousands.
- Tens of thousands.
How many, mates?
- Enough for a cricket team.
-
Enough to make our beer
run dry and our girls run loose.
Have to fuck the king himself to find a taxi
you warriors haven't commandeered.
I'd say it's a bit more
like a gang of roaches.
Every step we take, and bloody hell,
there's another Yank under our boot.
I'm guessing this is one Yank we don't
have to worry about anymore.
Hey, if it weren't for us
you'd be guzzling sake
with a pair of chopsticks up
your ass, you stupid fuck.
Okay okay, that's it.
Yeah right, you're all
Tommy Mix who saved the day.
It's okay.
Why don't you get out of here?
This one hits the turps,
first thing out he's having a blue.
Another dumb drunk
who thinks he can fight.
Let us buy you the next
round of drinks.
Otherwise what kind
of hosts would we be?
Alan, another round of drinks
for the cowboy Yanks.
Whoo!
Oh, Yank here.
Looking to see the town.
Oh, hello.
Hello, beautiful.
Visitor down under;
speak the same language.
Hey!
Hey, beautiful.
Oh, what the hell's
he doing?
Where's that tram go?
That's the Preston line.
He'll end up in Perth.
- Oh hey, Leckie, come on!
- Hey, Leckie, what the hell?
Excuse me, sir.
Ma'am.
I apologize.
Pardon me.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Leckie!
Whoa! Attaboy, Leck.
Are you proposing
already, Yank?
I'm proposing that you
take a walk with me.
You never know what
the future may bring.
You know what
take a walk means?
Oh, ma'am.
Ma'am, miss...
miss, I'm a foreigner
on your shores.
Forgive my ignorance
of your customs, but...
my invitation
remains an offer.
Ha.
You're a bold one sotted.
Let's see you
in the light of day.
Collect me at home.
Being sober
would be a plus.
-
-
I'm Stella, in case you were
wondering what to call me.
Ah.
Stella is it?
Well, you've got
guts, Leckie.
Thank you very much.
That made my night.
- You'd better laminate that piece of paper.
- That made my night.
-
-
- Gonna be good?
- I'll say.
Shh, be quiet.
- Hit it.
-
Company dismissed.
Puller:
Let me tell you something, Sergeant,
stumbling around camp
like the town stiff
is not acceptable behavior.
Not anymore.
Can't help but notice
I'm not alone in this, sir.
Well, you are
in one respect.
You are about to be awarded
the Medal of Honor.
President Roosevelt
found you worthy.
Congratulations, old man.
You're about to go where very
few Marines have ever been.
Oh, hey hey!
Here here.
Oh, shit.
This is...
I'm sorry.
Yeah, all right.
Listen,
get yourself a big breakfast
and a pot of coffee
and you come back here
when you're respectable.
It's not gonna do to have you heave
all over your own citation.
This is the highest honor that our
country can award a serviceman.
But from now on,
you try and act
like it's yours.
Yes, sir.
Well, go.
Aw, Jeez.
? You're just an angel
in disguise ?
? Who wandered down
from up above ?
? You're just a heavenly
surprise ?
? Who came to Earth
for me to love ?
? 'Cause introduction
to an angel ?
? Is more than thrilling ?
? It leaves me high... ?
The Articles of War?
That's what I'm calling 'em.
He's been going on about this
since long before
you came along.
See, Gwenie's dad, my son,
he's over there in Burma
showing the Japs
what side is up.
I'm in charge
of Gwenie's honor.
A manual of arms.
My grandfather would want
the same understanding.
Let's get this understood.
Hit him with it, girl.
Article l:
General provisions.
Hands off the merchandise.
You've memorized this?
See, I'm the merchandise.
Hand off, aye aye, sir.
Article Il:
Hands off the merchandise.
Meaning there'll be
none of that.
There's no problem there.
I'm not much of a dancer, sir.
Um, Article lll:
Punishments for violating
one and two.
It'll be swift
and unflinching.
Don't for a moment think
otherwise, son.
Yes, sir.
Make a hole.
Come on.
Drink it out of the glass
without spilling.
That's right.
Take your time.
Move closer.
A little closer.
- Closer.
- Come on.
Closer.
Closer.
- A little closer.
-
It's hard.
Come on.
MPs just pulled up.
You've got to get out of here.
Every Marine in this place is AWOL.
I'd say that's why
they're here.
Listen up.
Every Marine
in this establishment
will produce a Liberty Pass
or will return immediately to his billet.
- Oh, come on!
-
What's this then?
There's no problem.
I've got a pass.
But still, why don't I escort
Gwen out the back, sir?
- M. P: You're going back to your billet.
- Good night, Gramps.
- Don't wait up.
- M. P: Show me your pass.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, Mo.
Saddle up, pardner.
Stealing an MP's jeep?
Are you kidding me?
-
- Come on, Mo. Hop in.
You can't do this shit, John.
Not now.
Remember what
Chesty told you.
Don't screw this up.
Left.
March.
Line halt.
Detail halt.
Sir, detail is formed.
For extraordinary heroism
and conspicuous gallantry,
Sergeant John Basilone,
while at great risk
to his own life,
fought valiantly
to check a savage
and determined
Japanese assault
while serving the 1st Battalion,
in Guadalcanal on October
Sergeant John Basilone
is hereby awarded
the Medal of Honor.
Left as we go.
Right face.
Company right hut.
Face right.
So what's your name then?
Bob.
Sobered up,
are you, Bob?
I'm no fool.
These are for you.
I hope you're hungry.
Man on radio:
...created by the announcement
that President Roosevelt
and Winston Churchill
have met at Casablanca
and completed...
- Stella: This is Bob.
- Leckie.
Bob Leckie.
Shake hands
with my father Baba.
What a grip.
An American grip, eh?
This is my mama.
This is a Yank.
Skin and bones.
Like a skeleton. Like a rail.
He stole some roses
from Mrs. Bano's yard.
Let her scream.
Stella, his jacket. Ella.
I thought we were going
for a stroll.
Good news, Bob.
You're staying for dinner.
I am?
One word of an American coming
to call and that was that.
Leckie:
This is like a Thanksgiving.
Oh, what is that?
It's a holiday Roosevelt made
of the fourth Thursday of November.
Everyone sits at the table,
eats turkey and argues.
-
- Roosevelt is a great man.
You eat as much
as you like, eh? Ella.
The beans are from the garden.
You didn't touch the feta.
We save it
for tomorrow, huh?
Nay, Mama,
I'll start cleaning up.
You see?
Good girl, my Stella.
Good Greek girl.
Okay, but don't break the good dishes.
I won't.
You're on your own now.
I think I can
handle this one.
So, Mama,
what's a Greek girl like
you doing in Melbourne?
Oh, you don't care
about that.
No no no, don't go officer on me.
You're not Australian.
No no, I come from
the old country.
Smyrna.
That was sacked
by the Turks, wasn't it?
You know about that?
Um, I read a lot.
The Turks invaded in 1922
and burned it down.
All gone.
If you survived, you fled
like my mama and me.
But we made it down
to the docks.
We swam to a ship.
The captain took us onboard
and sailed us to Piraeus.
He saved our lives.
But our home was gone.
So where do we go?
We come here.
We live, we work,
we find love.
So now you must tell
about your home.
- Yeah, about America.
- No no no.
Not America.
America we see in the movies.
Your family.
Well, seems like we both
escaped disaster.
I fled the Leckie household.
Mama:
How many in the household?
Mama had five girls,
three boys.
Oh, octo babies.
Your lucky mama.
I don't know if she'd agree. She was
almost 40 by the time I came along.
Baba! Just like you and me, you hear?
She was worn out by then.
I think they all were.
But it's a blessing,
so many children.
Well, Marion and Foddy Leckie,
they didn't want eight kids.
Oh no?
They should stop?
They didn't want
the beautiful baby son?
I was last.
Last is least.
Oh, Bob.
You know nothing.
By the time I met Nicola
it was almost too late
to make babies.
Not that we didn't try, eh?
Eh, relax.
That girl in the kitchen,
my only blessing.
I prayed for more,
but God said no.
Nothing you can do
when God say no.
So where do you stay
with the Marines, huh?
They put us in the stadium
where you play cricket.
What? You will stay
here tonight.
Stella, get the bed
ready in the spare room.
- Okay.
- I can't do that.
- I could never repay you.
-
You can help clear
the vines from the roof.
Yes, you will do that.
You will make this
your home.
Twist a guy's arm.
Slanche.
Oh, dear God.
- Oh, God.
-
No no no,
you stay right there.
I think we should give it
another go.
Okay, sure.
Sure, me too.
But even Americans
need, uh...
Oh, a wait
before they reload.
It's okay.
I'm going nowhere.
Why did you have to flee
your family?
Oh...
my family.
Not a happy bunch,
my family.
Why not?
Something in our bones.
Did your brothers go into
the service to get away too?
One of my brothers
was too old.
The other died
when I was a kid.
That's terrible.
My father's been crippled
in the head ever since.
We're not exactly
the Judge Hardy family.
I swear, I'm just waiting
for the clock to hit midnight
and my sanity bell
goes ringing.
I had a brother
who died too.
You did?
No one talks about him.
He was a baby, just a few days old
and didn't live.
Mama got sick and wasn't
able to have any more.
Puller:
We start by restoring their bodies.
They rest.
They play.
Then we work
on their pride.
We remind them
they're Marines.
Then we replenish
our supplies.
See, all of that
takes money.
I understand.
It's a hell of a lot
easier to raise money
when there's a face
behind it
and a heroic story
attached to it,
like yours.
I don't feel
like a hero, sir.
You're not getting it.
All right.
Think of us out there
on that line.
You know what we need...
new weapons, new gear,
better motor transport.
Yes, sir.
Selling US war bonds
is just as important,
just as life saving,
as what you did
on Guadalcanal.
Now pack your seabag.
You're going home
Home?
How many US war bonds
you gonna sell
stomping around
the Solomons with us?
Go on.
Get it done, Sergeant.
Oh.
I liked that.
Shame on me.
I got you something.
Stockings?
Real silk?
I'll wear them
only for you.
Wait wait wait wait.
There's more.
This...
is for everyone.
Oh no.
- Leg of lamb.
- No.
How?
How did you get it?
- I'm not gonna tell you.
- Why not?
- I think you should kiss me first.
- How?
- How?
- I can't remember.
I can't get a leg of lamb.
But you do?
American ingenuity
and a few packs of Lucky Strikes.
"Nicholas Genkos...
wounded."
Is that
Theodora Genkos' nephew?
I don't know.
Baba checks the casualty
reports for Greek names.
"Alexi Stavrapolous."
Mama:
What's happened to Alexi?
"Killed in action."
I grew up with Alexi.
He lived two streets over.
Change your shirt, Nicola.
We'll take them
the spanikopita.
I'd like to go.
Pay my respects,
if they're friends of yours.
- This is my friend Bob.
- My condolences.
Mama:
Stella and Alexi,
they were friends every since
they were children.
He was her friend.
It's no good, Bob.
Mama is still up.
The Greek boys are gone.
More and more every day...
all of Stella's friends
from when she grew up.
I prayed for them,
and for their families.
Do you go to church, Bob?
- St. Mary's.
- Mmm.
What kind of church?
Catholic.
I like the early
morning mass.
Less people.
Mama:
Hmm, we need prayers.
How are we going to make it
through these years
if we don't pray?
We are so lucky to have
you with us, Bob,
to have a young man
in the house.
I like you.
Stella, she likes you.
Baba, he always wanted
a son like you.
I am going to pray
that you come back to us.
That's a good thing
to pray for.
Officer:
Let's get your squads going!
Pack up that gear
and let's go!
What? You thought Uncle Sam was gonna
pay for your great debauch forever?
- Officer: Move out!
- Semper fi.
Better gear up, brother.
Time to get
back in shape.
Chuckler: The M1 is better.
There's no contest.
- Runner: Okay, so show us.
- Okay, ready ready.
-
- Oh!
Chuckler:
Eight rounds over five.
Runner:
No, I will still keep my Springfield.
Chuckler: Jesus Christ, it's like
talking to an old lady.
Fine. You know what?
Keep your cane.
- I will keep my cane.
- I'll will take the M1
because it beats the hell
out of the Springfield.
No no no no.
The 03's are still more accurate.
- Exactly exactly.
- No no, they're slower.
- Target in sight.
- Watch him miss.
- Do it!
- Come on, Gibson.
- Come on, Gibson.
-
-
- Bull's-eye!
Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?
You just shot some
poor farmer's cow!
It was gonna
be steak anyway.
Not if it's a dairy cow,
you idiot.
-
- Good shot, Gibson.
What kind of morons
have you become?
Did you see that?
I've never seen that.
You will be given
one sack of raisins.
You will be given one sack
of uncooked rice.
A Japanese soldier
can live on that for three weeks.
You will march
the 100 miles
back to Melbourne
and be in the arms of your
Aussie girlfriends
in three days.
Fall in, column of two.
Standby to move out.
Let's go.
Fall in.
Move out!
Marine: H-2-1, drop your cocks
and grab your socks.
Formation in 20 minutes.
Come on, let's move.
On your feet, let's go.
Come on, shake it out.
Let's do it.
On your feet.
Let's move.
Fuck!
God!
You first.
Mmm!
Oh, sweet Jesus,
that feels good.
- Couple of doors down.
- Just right up?
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank you.
- Take this with you.
- No...
You have to go away, Bob.
Please don't come
here anymore.
I told Mama
and Baba already
that you got your orders and you left.
You couldn't say goodbye.
You lied?
I'm fairly crazy
about you, Robert.
I think you know that.
I thought so, yeah.
But...
I don't want to have
a baby with you.
Uh...
Are you pregnant?
- No. No.
- You're not?
Bob, you and I aren't going
to have a family.
And we're not going
to get married.
And you are never coming
back to Melbourne.
You're dumping me because you think
I'm gonna get killed?
Bob...
if you don't
come back to us,
I don't just lose you,
Mama does too.
I can't do that to her
and I won't let you.
She's lost so much
already, Bob.
She's praying for you
to come back to us.
She can save her breath.
Leckie.
Leckie, God love you.
- Come here.
- Fuck off.
No, seriously.
I've got to piss like terrible.
You've got to cover
for me, okay?
I can't.
Drunk as a skunk.
One minute, that's all I need.
Come on.
Come on.
Thank you.
Leckie, what are you doing?
Manning this fucking post,
Lieutenant.
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm the fucking guard on guard duty.
You pull a fucking sidearm
on an officer?
Lieutenant, I went for a quick piss.
Leckie was just covering.
- You fucking prick!
- Stand at attention.
- Fuck you!
- I said stand at attention!
And I said fuck you!
Chuckler:
? Don't sit under the apple tree ?
? With anyone else but me ?
? With anyone
else but me ?
? With anyone else but me ?
? No no no, don't sit under
the apple tree ?
? With anyone else but me ?
? With anyone
else but me ?
? Till I come
marching home. ?
-
- Yay, Ma.
- Run, Ma!
- Good hit, Ma.
Yes, Auntie,
that's a six.
So I guess it's sort of
like baseball, huh?
What happens in baseball?
Well, in baseball,
you hit a ball
and you run to a base.
Then you run to the next
base if you can.
You keep going
to the next base.
If you get to enough bases
you score a run.
Gwen: Sounds like rounders.
We play that in school.
Looks like someone is
hunting for you, cobber.
Hey, it's my turn.
Shit.
- Your unit?
- How Company, 1st Marines.
Report to your CO
no later than 2400.
I trust you Marines got
your heads back together.
I'm on orders from
Lieutenant Lebec has got
the platoon now,
and I want him to inherit
a solid outfit
so I volunteered you
for reassignment
to the Battalion
Intelligence section
You're booting us?
Not you...
Leckie.
Fuck.
So, a little light.
Yeah.
How about if an engine
catches fire
and you dump
in the Pacific?
Swim around for days, weeks,
get strafed by Jap Zeroes.
Finally the navy
picks you up.
Think about how many
war bonds you'd sell then.
Probably give you
another medal.
You're gonna look up
Katie, right?
First chance I get.
I've been sending my poker
winnings home to her.
Hey, 700 of that is mine.
-
- That's the good thing about leaving...
I won't lose anymore
money to you.
Wish you were coming with me.
I think that's you.
