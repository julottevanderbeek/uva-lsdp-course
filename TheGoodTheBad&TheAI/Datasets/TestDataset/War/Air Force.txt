ANYTIME YOU WANT.
YOU'LL BE GIVEN THE
WEATHER FORECASTS SOON.
WENDELL?
THAT ANSWERED IT,
SIR.
BOMBARDIERS.
MAJOR ROBERTS,
WHAT ABOUT AMMUNITION?
NO AMMUNITION.
ARE WE TAKING
BOMBSIGHTS, SIR?
WE'RE FERRYING THEM
FULLY EQUIPPED
EXCEPT FOR
AMMUNITION.
PILOTS, CHECK WITH
MAINTENANCE ON THAT.
HARPER,
YOU'LL CHECK OURS.
THAT'S IT.
THE CREWS DON'T KNOW
THE DESTINATION,
SO KEEP IT QUIET.
HOW ABOUT PHONING
OUR WIVES?
YOUR COPILOT
JUST GOT PERMISSION
TO RADIOGRAPH
LIEUTENANT McMARTIN'S SISTER
IN HONOLULU.
I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT
INTEREST YOU, McMARTIN.
YES, SIR.
WE'LL MEET HERE
TAKEOFF TIME
FOR FINAL INSTRUCTIONS.
HOW'S EVERYTHING,
SERGEANT?
FINE, SIR.
PUT A NEW MAGNETO
ON NUMBER TWO.
THEY DIDN'T TELL ME
WHERE WE'RE GOING.
THEY DIDN'T, HUH?
CAN YOU KEEP
A SECRET?
YES, SIR.
THAT'S GOOD!
CAPTAIN QUINCANNON,
PRIVATE CHESTER
REPORTING, SIR--
SECOND RADIO.
SERGEANT WHITE,
YOUR CREW CHIEF.
HI.
GLAD YOU'RE
WITH US, CHESTER.
I'VE WANTED
TO GET ON A FLYING FORTRESS
EVER SINCE
RADIO SCHOOL.
WHEN WAS THAT?
THREE MONTHS
AGO, SIR.
TURN HIM OVER
TO PETERSON, SERGEANT.
HE CAN LOOK OVER
THE RADIO SET.
YES, SIR.
PETERSON'S
INSIDE, SON.
MUST BE A BIG FLIGHT--
NINE FORTRESSES.
SO THEY SAY.
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHERE WE'RE GOING?
CAN YOU
KEEP A SECRET?
YES, SIR.
THAT'S GOOD.
HELLO.
ARE YOU THE NEW GUNNER?
NO, SECOND RADIO.
I'M WEINBERG,
SECOND ENGINEER.
I'M CHESTER.
GLAD TO KNOW YOU.
IS THAT WHAT SHE'S
CALLED, MARY-ANN?
YES. BEST SHIP
IN THE OUTFIT.
PETERSON, HERE'S
YOUR NEW RADIO.
HOW ARE YOU?
I'LL SHOW YOU AROUND.
ARE YOU THE CREW CHIEF?
YEAH,
MY NAME'S WHITE.
ARE YOU THE NEW GUNNER?
YEAH.
JOE WINOCKI.
PUT YOUR STUFF INSIDE.
YOU'RE LUCKY.
OUR GUNNER'S
ON FURLOUGH.
I WOULDN'T SAY
I'M LUCKY.
LOOKS LIKE
EVERYTHING'S O.K.
HOW ABOUT THE COFFEE
AND SANDWICHES?
GOT THEM.
I WISH WE HAD
EXTRA OXYGEN.
ALREADY INSIDE
THE PLANE.
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?
SIX BOTTLES.
GOT AN EXTRA ENGINE?
ALMOST ENOUGH PARTS
FOR ONE.
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT MY WIFE.
SHE SHOULD
BE HERE.
WINOCKI?
HE'S OUR NEW GUNNER.
CAPTAIN QUINCANNON.
DON'T I KNOW YOU,
SERGEANT?
I THINK SO, SIR.
YOU WERE AT
RANDOLPH FIELD?
WHILE I WAS
INSTRUCTING THERE?
OH, I REMEMBER--
I THINK
YOU REMEMBER.
ANYTHING ELSE, SIR?
NOT NOW, NO.
I GUESS THAT
NEW RADIO MAN
IS A GOOD KID.
YEAH.
WE'RE GETTING THEM
RIGHT OFF
THE BOTTLE NOW.
HOW OLD
IS YOUR KID?
WHERE'S HE
STATIONED?
CLARK FIELD, MANILA.
JUST GOT A BOOST.
IF HE GETS
ANOTHER BAR,
YOU'LL NEED
A BIGGER HAT.
IMAGINE ME SALUTING
MY OWN KID.
YOU'D PIN HIS EARS DOWN
IF HE DIDN'T TAKE IT.
EXCUSE ME, SIR,
MY MOTHER WOULD LIKE
TO MEET YOU.
SURE.
MOTHER, THIS IS
CAPTAIN QUINCANNON.
HOW DO YOU DO?
MIGHTY NICE OF YOU
TO SEE US OFF.
I WANTED TO MEET YOU
BECAUSE I WONDERED
WHAT KIND--
TAKE CARE OF HIM.
HE'LL BE
LOOKING AFTER ME.
THAT'S HOW
A BOMBER CREW FUNCTIONS.
DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT
CHESTER.
IT'S A ROUTINE FLIGHT.
THANKS.
GOOD-BYE.
GOOD-BYE.
I'LL WRITE
TO YOU, MOM,
SO YOU'LL KNOW
WHERE I AM.
DID YOU BRING THIS
FOR ME?
OH.
TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, MOM.
DON'T WORRY,
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
GOOD-BYE, SON.
GOOD-BYE, MOM.
SEEN MRS. QUINCANNON?
NO.
I GUESS
I'VE BEEN DITCHED.
GET ABOARD,
CHESTER.
IRISH!
IRISH!
ABOUT TIME,
MRS. QUINCANNON.
WHAT HAPPENED?
FLAT TIRE.
I WAS SCARED TO DEATH
I WOULDN'T MAKE IT.
I COULDN'T
BRING MICHAEL.
HE SENT YOU THIS--
AND THIS.
THANK YOU.
COULDN'T I
STOW AWAY?
I'D GET
COURT-MARTIALED.
I'LL BE BACK SOON.
WE'LL TAKE
THAT HONEYMOON.
I REMEMBER
EVERY HONEYMOON WE DIDN'T HAVE,
EVEN THE FIRST ONE.
YOU HAVEN'T
GOT MUCH CHANCE
TO BE BORED WITH ME.
I NEVER GET BORED
WITH YOU, IRISH.
IT'S BEEN FUN.
I GUESS I'M LUCKY.
ME, TOO.
IRISH,
YOU'LL REMEMBER
TO WEAR YOUR RUBBERS
IN THE RAIN?
SURE I WILL.
I'LL BE WAITING.
SO LONG, KID.
BETTER STOW THIS
OVER THERE, SERGEANT.
YES, SIR.
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
GET THAT LADDER ABOARD,
WILL YOU, WEINBERG?
O.K.
WHAT'S THAT FOR?
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHERE YOUR LUCK IS.
THAT'S FROM MICHAEL
QUINCANNON, JR.
EVERYBODY IN?
YES, SIR.
DOORS CLOSED?
YES.
CONTROLS?

ROBERTS TO FLIGHT,
CHECK'S O.K.
TWO READY.
THREE O.K.

FIVE O.K.
EIGHT READY.
O.K., START ENGINES.
ALL SET.
WE NEED
ONE SHOT, SIR.
O.K. NUMBER ONE.
NUMBER TWO.
TAKEOFF INSTRUCTIONS
FOR FLIGHT OF 9 B-17s.
SIR, IS THIS
A LOCAL FLIGHT?
NO.
O.K. TO TAXI UP
TO NORTH END OF RAMP.
USE RUNWAY 28.
WIND WEST, 15.
GO AHEAD.
ROGER.
ROBERTS TO FLIGHT.
ALL PLANES FOLLOW ME.
USE RUNWAY 28.
WIND WEST, 15 MILES.
TAKE OFF AT
LET'S GO.
LOOKS LIKE THEY'LL
RUN ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU, SIR.
CHECK THE
TAIL WHEEL, ROBBIE.
YES, SIR.
I'M GOING
UPSTAIRS.
O.K.
DON'T
GET US LOST.
WANT ANY HELP
RUNNING THIS THING?
HI, TOMMY.
HOW'S MONK?
KNEE-DEEP IN MAPS.
LOOKS LIKE
YOU GOT YOUR DATE.
WATCH OUT, TOMMY.
HE'LL BE
YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW.
SUSAN WON'T MARRY
BENEATH HERSELF.
YOU CAN'T
MAKE ME MAD.
TAKE A LAST LOOK.
GOOD-BYE,
SAN FRANCISCO.
HELLO, HONOLULU.
THERE'S THE GOLDEN GATE.
SAN FRANCISCO'S
A BIG TOWN.
STRICTLY
A ONE-WHISTLE STOP.
THERE'S ONLY
ONE CITY IN THE USA--
AND THAT'S NEW YORK.
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH CALIFORNIA?
CALIFORNIA?
THE SUN SHINES AND
NOTHING EVER HAPPENS.
NEW YORK'S
NO DIFFERENT.
MY SISTER'S TRIED
TO LEAVE BROOKLYN
FOR 40 YEARS.
BROOKLYN
AIN'T NEW YORK.
ONCE YOU CROSS
BROOKLYN BRIDGE,
YOU'VE LEFT
THIS WORLD.
I KNEW SOMEONE WHO
CROSSED IT IN 1929.
AIN'T HEARD
FROM HIM SINCE.
I'LL TAKE
MINNEAPOLIS.
MINNEAPOLIS! THAT AIN'T
YOUR HOME TOWN.
THE HAYSEED'S
STILL IN YOUR HAIR.
YEAH. BUT I CAN STILL
MILK A COW.
I'LL GET MINE
OUT OF A BOTTLE.
THAT'S THE CLOSEST
I'LL GET TO A COW.
YOU'RE HANDY
WITH THE BULL.
WE'RE SURE LUCKY.
WHY?
THIS WHOLE TRIP.
WHAT ABOUT IT?
A MILLION FELLOWS
WOULD GIVE ANYTHING
TO BE HERE.
WHY?
NOT JUST THIS FLIGHT,
BUT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.
HOW FAR DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL GET
AS AN ENLISTED MAN?
LOOK AT THE TRAINING
YOU GET.
IF YOU DON'T GO THROUGH
FLYING SCHOOL,
YOU DON'T RATE.
WHAT ARE YOU
IN IT FOR?
I'M GETTING OUT
NEXT MONTH.
YOU'RE GETTING OUT?
YEP.
WELL, I'M NOT.
STICK TO WHAT
YOU BELIEVE IN.
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.
WHAT'LL YOU BE
IN 20 YEARS, SERGEANT,
A BRIGADIER?
NO, BUT MY BOY IS.
WE LIKE THE AIR CORPS.
STAY IN THE BOX, SON,
AND KEEP ON PITCHING.
YEAH.
COMING UP
FORWARD, KID?
YEAH.
KEEP RIGHT ON PITCHING.
EVERYBODY ALL RIGHT?
FINE.
COFFEE, CAPTAIN?
PLEASE.
THANKS, SERGEANT.
YES, SIR.
YOU WANT
SOME COFFEE, WINOCKI?
NO, THANKS.
HOW'S IT GOING?
ALL RIGHT, SIR.
I WANT TO TALK
WITH YOU.
CAN I TALK, TOO?
SURE.
I WANT TO GET THINGS
STRAIGHT WITH YOU.
I'M STRAIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.
I KNOW WHAT'S
BOTHERING YOU.
YOU WANTED TO FLY,
DIDN'T YOU?
WHO DOESN'T?
YOU BLEW YOUR CHANCE.
THAT'S WHAT
YOU THINK.
NO, YOU COULDN'T
MAKE IT.
WHEN THE GOING
GOT TOUGH--
YOU THREW ME UP
FOR GRABS.
RUNNING INTO
DRISCOLL'S PLANE WAS AN ACCIDENT--
FOR WHICH YOU WASHED ME
OUT OF THE SCHOOL.
THE BOARD
WASHED YOU OUT.
ON YOUR RECOMMENDATION.
YOU LACKED FLYING ABILITY,
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN
ELIMINATED SOONER.
NOBODY HOLDS YOU
RESPONSIBLE
FOR DRISCOLL'S DEATH.
EXCEPT YOU.
NOT ME EITHER.
TWO OTHER MEN ON THIS SHIP
WASHED OUT AS PILOTS--
McMARTIN'S A BOMBARDIER,
HAUSER'S A NAVIGATOR.
THEY'RE BOTH GOOD.
YOU'RE A GOOD GUNNER.
WE NEED YOU, JUST LIKE
WE NEED THE WHOLE GANG.
IT TAKES ALL OF US
TO MAKE THIS SHIP FUNCTION.
WE"" ALL
"" BELONG TO THIS AIRPLANE.
EVERY MAN RELIES
ON EVERY OTHER MAN TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
YOU'VE PLAYED
FOOTBALL, WINOCKI.
YOU'LL PLAY BALL
WITH US,
OR I'LL HAVE TO
GET RID OF YOU.
NICE SPEECH,
BUT MY ENLISTMENT RUNS OUT SOON.
YOU'RE QUITTING, HUH?
YES, SIR.
THAT'S YOUR PRIVILEGE,
BUT UNTIL THEN,
YOU'RE STILL IN THE ARMY.
YES, SIR.
I'M SORRY FOR YOU,
WINOCKI.
ANYTHING ELSE?
THAT'S ALL.
PETERSON, IF YOU
WANT ENTERTAINMENT,
TUNE IN ON THE BROADCAST
FREQUENCIES.
I'LL STAY ON
THE COMMAND CENTER.
YES, SIR.
THANK YOU.
SAN FRANCISCO.

WEATHER REPORT
FROM HICKAM FIELD,SIR.
GET A GOOD SLEEP,
CHESTER?
NOT MUCH, SIR.
I DIDN'T WANT
TO MISS ANYTHING.
HOW'S THE KID,
SERGEANT?
FINE, SIR.
HE LIKES THE SHIP.
MARY-ANN LIKES HIM.
HOW ABOUT WINOCKI?
CAN'T MAKE HIM OUT.
NO, SIR.
THANKS, CHESTER.
SIR, ISN'T THAT
A PICTURE
OF CAPTAIN MONK HAUSER?
YEAH.
WHY, THAT'S--
MY FATHER.
I'M DUMB.
I SHOULD'VE REALIZED.
THERE'S NOT MUCH
RESEMBLANCE, I GUESS.
SURE THERE IS.
I'VE SEEN HIM
IN A BOOK I GOT.
YEAH.
GEE, HE COULD
SURE FLY.
YEAH.
WISH I COULD
FLY LIKE HIM.
IT WON'T BE LONG
BEFORE YOU SEE
DIAMOND HEAD
STICKING OUT
OF THAT OCEAN.
SEE WHAT YOU WANT.
I USED TO DREAM ABOUT
GOING SOMEPLACE
WHERE A GUY WOULD HAVE
SOME ELBOWROOM.
THIS IS OVERDOING IT.
NO SIGN OF FISH.
IT'S LIKE BEING
ON THE PRAIRIES.
I THOUGHT
THERE'S NOTHING WEST OF MANHATTAN
EXCEPT JERSEY.
I COULD USE
SOME COFFEE.
YOU KNOW WHO
THE NAVIGATOR'S FATHER WAS?
SURE. MONK HAUSER.
WHO'S THAT?
HOW OLD WERE YOU
IN THE WAR?
OLDER THAN YOU.
YOU NEVER
HEARD OF HIM?
NO.
WAS THAT LIEUTENANT
HAUSER'S FATHER?
THAT'S HIM.
I KNEW HIM.
HE WAS PLENTY GOOD.
YEAH. WHY AIN'T
HIS KID A PILOT?
TRIED TOO HARD.
LIKE MANY OTHERS.
THAT'S FUNNY.
HICKAM RADIO WENT OFF
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF A WEATHER REPORT.
MAYBE IT FADED OUT.
IT DIDN'T
SOUND LIKE IT.
WHAT IS IT?
WAIT.
WHO HAVE YOU TUNED IN,
ORSON WELLES?
SHUT UP.
BETTER TELL THE CAPTAIN.
RADIO OPERATOR TO PILOT.
RADIO OPERATOR TO PILOT.
GO AHEAD.
SIR, HICKAM'S
OFF THE AIR.
WHAT'S THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
CHINESE?
NO, JAPS.
NUMBER FOUR

STAND BY, IRISH,
I HEAR IT.
KEEP OFF THE AIR.
HICKAM RADIO.
HICKAM RADIO.
HICKAM RADIO,
ANSWER.
HICKAM RADIO,
ANSWER, PLEASE.
FLIGHT OF B-17s TO HICKAM
WANT LANDING INSTRUCTIONS.
HICKAM RADIO,
ANSWER, PLEASE.
GIVE ME LANDING INSTRUCTIONS
FOR A FLIGHT OF B-17s.
HICKAM RADIO,
CALL, PLEASE.
SILENCE YOUR RADIO!
WE'RE BEING ATTACKED
BY ENEMY AIRCRAFT.
WE'RE BEING ATTACKED.
LAND ELSEWHERE!
LAND ELSEWHERE!
ROBERTS TO FLIGHT.
WE'RE GOING INTO
EMERGENCY FIELDS.
I'LL TAKE THE ONE
FURTHEST NORTH.
NUMBER NINE,
FURTHEST SOUTH,
THE REST OF YOU,
IN BETWEEN.
GET ON THE GROUND
AND STAY THERE.
PETERSON, SEND
THE CREW CHIEF
UP HERE RIGHT AWAY.
GET THE RUBBER BOATS READY.
PASS OUT .45s
AND AMMUNITION.
WHERE TO, MONK?
TURN TO 120 DEGREES.
O.K.,
WISH WE WERE THERE.
IF WE ONLY HAD
MACHINE GUN LOADS.
I'LL HEAVE A WRENCH
AT THOSE MONKEYS.
GET THE RUBBER
BOATS READY.
PASS OUT SIDEARMS.
YES, SIR.
TELL EVERYBODY TO
KEEP THEIR EYES OPEN.
PUT YOUR LIFE VESTS ON.
KEEP A WATCH
UPSTAIRS, KID.
PUT YOUR LIFE VESTS ON.
IS THIS ON THE LEVEL?
YOU GUESS.
WINOCKI,
PUT YOUR VEST ON.
RELAX, THIS
IS A DRILL.
PERSONALLY,
I WOULDN'T CARE
IF YOU LEFT IT OFF.
THANKS, BRIGADIER.
NAVIGATOR TO PILOT.
CHANGE COURSE TO 135.
WE'LL LAND IN 22 MINUTES.
RIGHT. 135.
THIS ONE
REALLY IS SMALLER
THAN A POSTAGE STAMP.
THAT'S ABOUT IT.
LOOKS LIKE IT HERE.
HOLD IT THERE.
WILL IT WORK?
IT'LL HOLD, SIR.
MY MESSY LANDING
CAUSED THIS.
THIS FIELD WASN'T
BUILT FOR MARY ANN
CAPTAIN, SOMETHING'S MOVING
OVER IN THE BRUSH.
WHY, IT'S
THE LIEUTENANTS.
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'VE HAD A TRIP.
WE DID.
HERE'S
THE WATER.
FIND THE
OTHER FIELD?
YEAH. NO AMMUNITION
THERE EITHER.
TWO OF OUR FLIGHT
ARE THERE.
BOTH ARE O.K.
THAT ACCOUNTS FOR
EVERYONE THEN.
TWO LA
AT MOLOKAI.
ROBERTS AND THE REST
MADE HICKAM.
NOBODY WAS HURT.
HEARD ANYTHING ELSE?
NOTHING.
SOUND BAD AT HICKAM?
DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.
WE HAD TROUBLE
OURSELVES.
WHAT?
SOME MEN
IN THE CANE FIELD
STARTED SHOOTING AT US.
LOCAL JAPS--
FRIENDLY FELLOWS.
I THINK
WE LOST THEM.
I HOPE SO.
BACK TO
YOUR BOMBSIGHT.
YEAH.
STEP ON IT!
DOUSE THAT LIGHT!
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!
WINOCKI, CUT IT OUT!
KNOCK THESE LOGS AWAY.
ALL RIGHT, SHOVE!
EVERYBODY IN THE SHIP!
I HOPE
WE GET OUT.
WE GOT IN.
HEY, THEY
AIN'T KIDDING.
DID YOU SEE
THAT BUMBLEBEE?
LOCK THEM.
LOCKED.
CHECK THE TANKS
AND SEE
IF THEY'VE BEEN HIT.
YES, SIR.
ALL RIGHT.
LET ME ALONE.
ALL RIGHT.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
I OWE YOU ONE.
HOW FAR WOULD YOU
HAVE GOTTEN?
THEY'D HAVE
CUT YOU DOWN OUT THERE.
INSTEAD, YOU DID.
A FEW SHOTS
IN THE RIGHT PLACE
COULD HAVE
SET THIS SHIP AFIRE.
WINOCKI, STOP TRYING
TO PROVE SOMETHING.
MY JOB IS TAILGUNNER.
WHAT'S YOURS? LECTURING?
NO, MY JOB IS TO KEEP
THIS THING FLYING.
O5564 TO HICKAM FIELD.
SHUT OFF YOUR RADIO!
STAY WHERE YOU ARE!
JUST CLEARED FIELD--
HAVE TO COME NOW.
O.K. CALL JUST BEFORE
YOU ARRIVE.
ROGER.
PILOT TO CREW,
LOOK AT PEARL HARBOR.
IT'S SOMETHING YOU'LL
WANT TO REMEMBER.
DAMN THEM.
DAMN THEM!
NOW AIN'T YOU GLAD YOU'RE
GETTING OUT OF THE ARMY?
APPROACHING FIELD
FROM THE SOUTH FOR LANDING.
CAN'T GIVE YOU LIGHTS.
ROGER.
TAKE THE WEST SIDE.
WATCH FOR BOMB CRATERS.
GOOD LUCK.
ROGER.
PILOT TO CREW,
FASTEN YOUR
SAFETY BELTS--
MIGHT BE
A ROUGH LANDING.
ALL SET.
ALL CHECKED
FOR LANDING.
GIVE ME FULL FLAPS.
FLAPS COMING DOWN.
LANDING LIGHTS.
LIGHTS.
AIR SPEED, 110.
CAPTAIN QUINCANNON,
SIR.
HOW ARE YOU,
CAPTAIN?
YOU WERE TOLD
TO STAY PUT.
WE WERE BEING
SHOT AT BY SNIPERS.
WE DIDN'T WANT TO
LOSE THE AIRPLANE.
YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.
WE'VE GOT OUR
TROUBLES HERE, TOO.
YES, SIR.
THEY CERTAINLY
DID A COMPLETE JOB.
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THOSE P-40s?
THREE VEGETABLE TRUCKS
ARRIVED FROM HONOLULU.
WHEN THE FIRST JAP
PLANES SHOWED,
THE TRUCKS SMASHED
THE TAILS OFF EVERY SHIP ON LINE.
WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS McMARTIN?
ME, SIR.
YOU'RE WANTED
AT THE HOSPITAL.
MY SISTER?
SHE ASKED FOR WILLIAMS
AND QUINCANNON, TOO.
WE WANT YOUR SHIP
SERVICED IMMEDIATELY.
ANY REPAIRS NEEDED?
THERE'S A WHEEL
TO BE CHECKED.
THESE MEN WILL HELP.
SERGEANT, YOU HEARD
THE COLONEL.
ANYTHING ELSE, SIR?
WHO'S YOUR NAVIGATOR?
LIEUTENANT HAUSER.
I HAVE
A JOB FOR YOU.
BEG YOUR PARDON,
SIR.
HELLO, SERGEANT.
DID THEY ATTACK
CLARK FIELD, MANILA?
MY BOY'S THERE.
YES, THEY HIT IT.
HIT EVERYTHING
IN THE PACIFIC--
GUAM, WAKE, MIDWAY.
I REMEMBER YOUR BOY.
HE'S A
FIRST LIEUTENANT,
FLIGHT COMMANDER.
HE'S A GOOD PILOT THEN.
DON'T WORRY.
THANK YOU, SIR.
FELLOWS,
WE GOT WORK TO DO.
MISS McMARTIN?
RIGHT DOWN
THAT WAY.
I CAN'T SEE.
IT'S GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT.
BUT I CAN'T SEE.
I CAN'T SEE.
LIEUTENANT McMARTIN,
YOU CAN ONLY STAY
A FEW MINUTES.
SURE.
SUE.
HELLO, KID.
WHY, IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU BOYS.
I WAS KIND OF SCARED,
ACTED LIKE A NINNY.
WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHETHER YOU HAD A FLAT TIRE
OR COULDN'T FIND THE PLACE.
OH, TOMMY, BILL,
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
GOD, IT HURTS WHEN I CRY.
DON'T, SUE.
I WANTED TO
TELL YOU ABOUT...
I GUESS
I'M KIND OF TIRED.
HE'LL TELL YOU.
WHO?
TEX. TEX RAIDER.
DON'T GET MAD ANYMORE.
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.
HE TRIED GETTING ME
OUT OF THE CAR, BUT...
I GUESS HE'D
BETTER TELL YOU.
SURE.
WILL YOU COME
IN THE MORNING?
YOU BET.
GOOD NIGHT.
SERGEANT, WHERE CAN WE
FIND LIEUTENANT RAIDER?
THIS WAY.
RAIDER.
RAIDER.
OH, HELLO,
TOMMY.
HOW ARE YOU,
BILL?
I GUESS
I WENT TO SLEEP.
WE JUST CAME
FROM THE HOSPITAL.
SUPPOSE YOU DO
A LITTLE EXPLAINING.
WHAT IS THIS,
THE THIRD DEGREE?
SHE SAID IT
WASN'T HIS FAULT.
IT WAS MY FAULT.
I SHOULD HAVE
GOTTEN HER OUT OF THE CAR.
I BOUGHT IT
FOR THE PARTY.
WE WERE
STARTING OUT
WHEN THE FIRST
PLANES CAME OVER.
UP EARLY, WEREN'T YOU?
RAIDER, GO AHEAD.
WE SPOTTED
THE PLANES AND HEARD THE BOMBS.
I TOLD SUSAN
TO HOP OUT AND GET UNDER COVER.
GO ON.
A TRUCK BLOCKED
THE ROAD AHEAD OF US.
IT WAS A DELIVERY TRUCK
FROM HONOLULU.
I THOUGHT
THE DRIVER HAD BEEN HIT.
THEN THERE WAS
AN EXPLOSION IN FRONT OF ME.
THERE WAS A JAP
BEHIND THE WHEEL WITH A SHOTGUN.
I HIT HIM
AND MOVED THE TRUCK.
WAS SUSAN
ALL RIGHT THEN?
YEAH, BUT THAT'S
WHEN I SHOULD HAVE MADE HER GET OUT.
SHE TOOK THE WHEEL
AND DROVE
ACROSS THE FIELD TOWARD THE HANGAR.
HOW DID SHE
GET HURT THEN?
MACHINE GUN.
A SOLDIER WAS KILLED
SAVING HER.
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?
YOU'RE NOT HURT ANY.
NOW LISTEN,
WAIT A MINUTE!
IF I STAY HERE, I'LL...
YOU GUYS
DON'T THINK--
SEE YOU.
YOU WANTED TO
SEE ME, COLONEL?
HOW IS YOUR SISTER,
McMARTIN?
PRETTY WEAK, SIR.
THE SURGEON SAYS
IT'S HARD TO TELL YET.
I'M GOING OVER
IN THE MORNING.
I'M AFRAID NOT.
THIS PLANE LEAVES
BEFORE DAYLIGHT FOR MANILA.
WE'RE SAFE HERE,
BUT THE PHILIPPINES ARE IN BAD SHAPE.
WE'RE SENDING
AS MANY B-17s AS POSSIBLE.
WHERE DO WE REFUEL?
WAKE ISLAND.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'LL FIND THERE.
YOU GOT
THE CHARTS THERE?
YES, SIR.
HOW DID THE ENGINES
REV UP, SERGEANT?
NUMBER-THREE ENGINE'S
A LITTLE ROUGH.
WE'LL OVERHAUL IT
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.
WE'RE TAKING OFF
IN TWO HOURS.
YOU'LL SEE THAT SON
OF YOURS SOON.
MANILA? WE'LL HAVE
THAT ENGINE RUNNING  IN 90 MINUTES.
WE'LL MAKE IT
ALL RIGHT, SIR.
TAKE OFF WHENEVER
YOU'RE READY.
TELL YOUR PASSENGER
I'LL HAVE PAPERS FOR HIM.
WHAT PASSENGER?
MANILA
NEEDS A PILOT.
YOU'RE TAKING ONE
ALONG--
HE'S ONE
OF THREE FIGHTERS
THAT GOT
OFF THE GROUND THIS MORNING.
KNOCKED OFF
FOUR JAPS BEFORE THEY SHOT HIM DOWN.
GOOD LUCK AGAIN.
THANK YOU, SIR.
LOOKS LIKE YOU TWO FELLOWS
TALKED OUT OF TURN.
GO AND RUSTLE UP SOME GRUB
FOR THE CREW.
YES, SIR.
JAVA, LIEUTENANT?
NO. YOU MUST HAVE
A PLANTATION IN BRAZIL.
MAYBE YOU'LL
WANT SOME LATER.
IS THIS HERE
WAKE ISLAND?
YEAH.
HOW FAR IS IT?
IT'S ABOUT 2,300 MILES
FROM HONOLULU.
WE'RE LANDING
ON THAT DOT?
YEAH.
I WISH THERE WAS
SOME TRAFFIC SIGNS AROUND,
LIKE NUMBERS
AND STREETS.
THEY CALL THEM
LATITUDES AND LONGITUDES.
THEY'RE JUST
LIKE SIGNS?
YEAH, IF THE WIND
DOESN'T CHANGE THEM.
LIEUTENANT,
HOW ARE WE DOING?
YOU'RE THE FIFTH GUY
TO ASK THAT.
WE'LL HIT WAKE
ALL RIGHT.
YES, SIR.
I WAS JUST ASKING.
TIME TO RELIEVE THE KID,
MINNESOTA.
O.K.
WANT ANYTHING,
LIEUTENANT?
I'D LIKE TO GET OUT
OF THIS BOXCAR.
MARY-ANN
AIN'T NO BOXCAR.
MARY-ANN?
THERE AIN'T A BETTER
AIRPLANE AROUND.
MAYBE, IF YOU
MEAN BOMBERS.
ANY AIRPLANE.
I'LL TAKE A
PURSUIT SHIP FOR MINE.
YOU CAN TAKE PURSUIT--
YES, SIR.
THAT'S MY LAST APPLE.
DON'T LEAVE IT
LAYING AROUND.
THERE'S A PURSUIT PILOT
BACK THERE.
HOW ARE WE DOING?
EVERY 15 MINUTES
SOMEBODY COMES DOWN HERE
TO FIND OUT IF I'LL
GET THIS AIRPLANE LOST!
I'M GETTING SICK OF--
I'M SORRY, SERGEANT.
I'M A LITTLE ON EDGE.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S HOW YOUR
OLD MAN WOULD HAVE TOLD ME OFF.
YEAH, I GUESS SO.
HOW ARE
WE DOING?
WE'LL HIT WAKE
RIGHT ON THE NOSE.
SURE WE WILL, SIR.
WHAT IF THE JAPS
TAKE WAKE ISLAND
BEFORE WE GET THERE?
I WISH YOU'D CONTROL
THAT IMAGINATION OF YOURS.
WE'RE NOT AT WAR.
WE'RE NOT?
IT HASN'T
BEEN DECLARED.
THEM JAPS, THEY SMEAR
PEARL HARBOR, SMACK MANILA,
RAID WAKE, GUAM,
AND MIDWAY,
AND STILL
THERE AIN'T NO WAR.
THEY SEND SOME GENTS
TO WASHINGTON
WITH AN OLIVE WREATH
FOR THE PRESIDENT.
YOU JUST WAIT
UNTIL UNCLE SAM GETS MAD.
I THINK I'LL GET
SLIGHTLY ANNOYED IN THE MEANTIME.
I DIDN'T
EXPECT IT OF YOU.
MESSAGE COMING THROUGH, SIR,
AND GOOD NEWS.
THANKS, PETERSON.
HEY, YOU GUYS,
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
THAT'S WONDERFUL.
SHE MUST BE O.K., HUH?
SURE, SHE IS.
I FEEL A LOT BETTER.
ME, TOO.
BETTER SHOW IT
TO OUR PASSENGER.
THE POOR GUY
MUST BE WORRYING.
LET HIM WORRY.
AREN'T YOU BEING
A LITTLE TOUGH?
I HAVEN'T
KICKED HIM YET.
ARE YOU JEALOUS?
WELL, MAYBE I AM.
PETERSON, ASK
LIEUTENANT RAIDER TO COME UP FRONT.
LOOK, STAY OUT
OF ARGUMENTS.
WE DIDN'T START THEM.
THE GUY HAS BEEN
SHOOTING OFF HIS FACE AGAINST BIG AIRPLANES.
HE DOESN'T
KNOW ANY BETTER.
JUST QUIT ARGUING.
YOU'LL BE BETTER OFF.
O.K., CAPTAIN.
SOMEBODY
WANTED TO SEE ME?
YEAH, WE GOT
GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.
BOY, THAT IS
GOOD NEWS.
OH, SHE'S
A SWELL KID.
TEX, WE WERE ALL
PRETTY UPSET LAST NIGHT.
IF WE SAID ANYTHING
OUT OF LINE...
OH, FORGET IT.
WE'VE HAD OUR ARGUMENTS
ABOUT THESE BIG BOMBERS
AND YOUR PEASHOOTERS.
FORGET IT. IT'S JUST
A MATTER OF OPINION.
WHAT WAS IT LIKE
YESTERDAY AT HICKAM?
AN AWFUL MESS.
WE WEREN'T READY.
HOW GOOD
ARE THOSE JAPS?
THEY'RE GOOD
WHEN THEY GOT THE EDGE.
THEY DON'T LIKE
AN EVEN FIGHT.
WE HEARD YOU DID
A SWELL JOB.
HOW COME ALL THEIR
CARRIERS GOT AWAY?
WE DIDN'T EVEN
GET A BOMBER OFF.
IT'S NOT
THE BOMBER'S FAULT!
YOU'RE AWFUL TOUCHY
ABOUT THESE CRATES.
HOLD IT!
GO AHEAD, MONK.
THE WIND'S SHIFTED.
YOU BETTER MAKE IT 244.
O.K., 244.
THAT'S A NEW
FLIGHT CONTROL?
YEAH,
IT'S BETTER THAN THE OLD TYPE.
WHY DON'T YOU
FLY HER?
NO, LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S FLYING HERSELF.
SHE IS NOW,
YEAH.
SHE'S NOT FLYING FAST.
SHE'LL OUTFLY YOUR
PURSUIT SHIPS UP HIGH.
WHAT WILL A
P-40 DO AT 30,000?
WE'D RUN AWAY
AND HIDE ON YOU.
IF YOU GIVE ME A CHANCE,
I'LL PROVE SOMETHING, O.K.?
GO AHEAD.
JUST THREE MINUTES
AND NO INTERRUPTIONS.
THE NAVIGATOR
GAVE YOU A COURSE.
YOU TURN A KNOB,
YOU'RE ON IT.
THAT GADGET'S ALMOST
AS GOOD AS YOUR BOMBSIGHT.
YOU CALL THE SIGHT
"THE BRAIN."
THIS IS A
MECHANICAL BRAIN, TOO.
IT'S DOING
THE THINKING NOW.
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT IT?
THEY'LL GIVE COMMISSIONS
TO THESE MECHANICAL BRAINS
IN THE BOMBERS.
THEY'LL TURN OUT
BOMBER PILOTS
ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE.
WE PURSUIT PILOTS
WILL SEE THESE MECHANIZED
FREIGHT TRAINS COMING.
YOU TELL THAT THING,
"DROP A LOAD ON THE ENEMY."
"YES, SIR, I'LL TELL
CAPTAIN BOMBSIGHT NOW."
"WHERE'S YOUR PILOTS?"
"ON THE GROUND.
WE DON'T NEED THEM."
VERY FUNNY.
SERIOUSLY, THESE
BIG CRATES ARE ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T WANT
TO FIGHT IN ANY AIRPLANE
THAT MORE THAN ONE MAN
CAN RIDE IN.
I DON'T WANT TO DEPEND
ON OTHER GUYS.
IN A PURSUIT SHIP,
YOU DON'T WAIT FOR ORDERS
FROM A GUY WHO CAN'T FLY
THEY CALL A BOMBARDIER.
"WHERE TO?"
SAYS THE IRISHMAN.
YOU SAY, "GO A FEW BLOCKS,
THROW AN EGG
OUT THE WINDOW, AND RUN."
I WOULDN'T FLY THIS
IF THEY MADE ME A BRIGADIER.
RADIO TO PILOT.
THE PRESIDENT'S
ON THE SHORT WAVE, SIR.
GET BELOW AND GRAB
SOME HEADPHONES.
TAKE THAT
PURSUIT PILOT WITH YOU.
DO I HAVE TO?
DROP HIM OUT
IF YOU GET A CHANCE.
THE ATTACK YESTERDAY
ON THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS
HAS CAUSED SEVERE DAMAGE
TO AMERICAN NAVAL
AND MILITARY FORCES.
I REGRET TO TELL YOU
THAT MANY AMERICAN LIVES
HAVE BEEN LOST.
BUT ALWAYS
WILL OUR WHOLE NATION
REMEMBER THE CHARACTER
OF THE ONSLAUGHT AGAINST US.
I HOPE HE SAYS
SOMETHING
ABOUT
THE PHILIPPINES.
MY BOY'S
AT CLARK FIELD.
NO MATTER HOW LONG
IT MAY TAKE US
TO OVERCOME THIS
PREMEDITATED INVASION,
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
IN THEIR RIGHTEOUS MIGHT,
WILL WIN THROUGH
TO ABSOLUTE VICTORY.
WE WILL NOT ONLY
DEFEND OURSELVES
TO THE UTTERMOST,
BUT WILL MAKE IT
VERY CERTAIN
THAT THIS
FORM OF TREACHERY
SHALL NEVER AGAIN
ENDANGER US.
WITH CONFIDENCE
IN OUR ARMED FORCES,
WITH THE UNBOUNDING
DETERMINATION OF OUR PEOPLE,
WE WILL GAIN
THE INEVITABLE TRIUMPH,
SO HELP US GOD.
I ASK THAT
THE CONGRESS DECLARE
A STATE OF WAR.
PICK UP ANYTHING
FROM WAKE ISLAND?
PILOT
TO NAVIGATOR.
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, MONK?
GO ANOTHER 10 MINUTES
AND THEN TURN EAST.
O.K.
THERE SHE IS,
DEAD AHEAD.
GOOD GUESSING,
MONK.
AW, SHUT UP.
MAGELLAN!
PILOT TO CREW,
WAKE ISLAND AHEAD.
HEY, WAKE ISLAND
IN SIGHT!
BOY, WHAT A NAVIGATOR!
THERE'S NOTHING HERE
BUT MARINES.
WHERE DID YOU
GUYS COME FROM?
HICKAM FIELD.
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING?
MANILA.
GANGWAY, MEN, COMING IN.
I'M MAJOR DANIELS,
COMMANDING.
QUINCANNON.
MEET LIEUTENANTS WILLIAMS,
McMARTIN, AND RAIDER.
THIS IS LIEUTENANT HAUSER,
OUR NAVIGATOR.
GOT TO PUT HIM
IN A GLASS CASE IN A MUSEUM.
GOOD JOB,
HAUSER.
THE ISLAND
LOOKED GOOD TO ME.
ME, TOO!
IT LOOKS BETTER
THAN ANY TIME SINCE MONDAY.
YOU MEAN
SUNDAY, SIR.
YOU'VE CROSSED  THE DATE LINE.
HE'S A PURSUIT PILOT.
THEY DON'T
GET AROUND VERY MUCH.
COULD WE BUNK DOWN
FOR ABOUT 6 HOURS?
IN 6 HOURS, YOU'LL
BE 5 1/2 HOURS OUT OF HERE.
WITH OUR BEACONS,
THE JAPS DON'T HAVE TO WAIT!
MY ORDERS
ARE TO GET YOU OUT IN 20 MINUTES.
THAT'S RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
SERGEANT?
WE'RE HALFWAY
TO MANILA NOW.
WE'LL MAKE IT
THE REST OF THE WAY.
I COULD USE
SOME HELP.
TAKE ALL THE MEN
YOU NEED.
YOU FIVE MEN
COME WITH ME,
I WANT THE COWLING
OFF THE ENGINE.
OUR AIR FORCE COMMANDER,
MAJOR BAGLEY,
WANTS TO SEE YOU.
YES, SIR.
THEY GOT
THE ARIZONA?
YES, HICKAM FIELD
WAS HIT AS BAD AS PEARL HARBOR.
WE GOT PRACTICALLY
NOTHING OFF THE GROUND.
I'VE STUDIED ALL THE WARS
OF HISTORY, GENTLEMEN.
I'VE NEVER COME ACROSS
ANY DIRTY TREACHERY LIKE THAT.
HOW MANY AIRPLANES
HAVE YOU GOT?
A WEEK AGO,
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY.
A FEW DAYS AGO,
THEY FLEW IN 12 FIGHTERS.
EIGHT WERE DESTROYED
ON THE GROUND
FOLLOWING PATROL.
ONLY FOUR LEFT?
ONLY TWO.
ONE OF THOSE CAN'T FLY.
THOSE FOUR GRUMMANS
TOOK ON 60 NIPS TODAY.
SHOT DOWN PLENTY.
HOGAN AND INGERSOLL
GOT THEIRS.
I THINK YOU KNEW THEM.
YEAH. YEAH.
YEAH.
I SUPPOSE THE JAPS
WILL BE BACK.
WHAT WILL YOU DO?
WE GOT A LAD
WHO WILL TAKE THEM ALL ON
SINGLE-HANDED!
LIEUTENANT ROSE.
BUDDY ROSE?
YOU GUYS
REMEMBER ROSE.
EVERYBODY KIDDED HIM
ABOUT HIS SIZE,
A LITTLE BITTY SQUIRT
ABOUT THAT HIGH.
WE KNEW HIM.
I'D LIKE TO SALUTE HIM.
COULD WE TALK TO HIM?
HE NEEDS REST.
WE MAY HAVE TO
ROUST HIM OUT ANY MINUTE.
AND HE HASN'T HAD
MUCH OF A CHANCE TO SLEEP.
SHIP'S READY, SIR.
ALL RIGHT, SERGEANT.
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
GO OUT AND BLAST THE JAPS.
TEACH THEM
THAT TREACHERY CAN'T WIN,
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
OF A HEAD START IT HAS.
YOU YOUNG FELLOWS
WILL DO THAT.
WE'RE ONLY FIGHTING
A DELAYING ACTION HERE.
YOU CAN'T HOLD OUT?
MY 400 MARINES
ARE FIGHTING MAD.
SOME JAP TAIL FEATHERS
WILL BE FLYING.
MAJOR BAGLEY,
CAN'T WE FLY YOU OUT?
YOU AND THE REST
OF THE WOUNDED?
NO, I'M NOT WORTH
MY WEIGHT IN GASOLINE.
ME OR ANYBODY ELSE.
THEY NEED YOUR SHIP
IN MANILA.
GET IT THERE.
YES, SIR.
IF YOU SEE
GENERAL MacARTHUR,
TELL HIM NO MATTER WHAT
THE NEWS IS...
WE'LL BE PITCHING
TILL THEY STRIKE US OUT.
YES, SIR, WE WILL.
I'LL SEE YOU ALL.
SEE YOU, MAJOR.
GOOD LUCK.
SHOULD WE
TAKE HIM WITH US?
HE WOULDN'T LEAVE
THIS ISLAND OF PARADISE,
NO MATTER WHAT.
HERE'S ONE
FOR THE WIFE.
AND ONE
FOR THE KID.
DON'T LOSE THEM,
SOLDIER.
DON'T WORRY.
I WANTED TO LEAVE
A LETTER FOR  THE CLIPPER.
SHE GOT AWAY
YESTERDAY.
THE CREW WANTED
TO STAY HERE AND FIGHT.
TAKE CARE
OF THIS ONE.
O.K.
WE DON'T WANT
TRIPOLI TO GET HURT.
HE AIN'T NO PEDIGREE,
BUT HE CAN FIGHT.
HE'D TACKLE A JAP
THREE TIMES HIS SIZE.
I WISH I COULD,
BUT I CAN'T.
JUST GIVE HIM TO
THE MARINES IN MANILA.
BUT...
COME ON.
YOU GOT TO GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
IT'S AGAINST
REGULATIONS, PAL.
I CAN'T TAKE
THAT DOG ALONG.
YOU COULD
GET ME BUSTED.
HE'S TRAINED, TOO.
DO YOU LIKE MR. MOTO?
AIN'T THAT CUTE,
WINOCKI?
HE'S SMART,
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
GEE, I'D LIKE TO,
HONEST, BUT...
AW, GEE, HERE GOES
MY PROMOTION.
THAT'S A GOOD FELLA.
DUCK.
HERE THEY COME.
GOOD-BYE, SIR.
ANYTHING WE CAN
DO FOR YOU IN MANILA?
YOU MIGHT SEND US
MORE JAPS.
GOOD LUCK, MEN.
CAN'T YOU SLEEP?
NO, I KEEP THINKING
OF THOSE MARINES ON WAKE.
THEY HAVEN'T
GOT A PRAYER, IRISH.
I KNOW THEY HAVEN'T.
THEY'LL HAVE FUN
BEFORE ANYBODY GETS ON THAT ISLAND.
YEAH.
SHH!  SHH!
HOW ARE THINGS,
SERGEANT?
OH, I'M KIND OF...
WHAT THE...
WHY, IT'S A DOG!
WHO BELONGS TO THIS?
IS THAT YOUR DOG?
NO, IT AIN'T.
WHAT KIND OF CREW CHIEF
DO YOU THINK I AM?
WHO PUT HIM ON BOARD?
MAYBE HE JUST
WALKED ON.
AND TIED HIMSELF
IN A SACK?
WHO DID IT?
YOU, WEINBERG?
MAYBE THE MARINES
DONE IT.
THEY HAD
A DOG NAMED TRIPOLI.
TALK FAST!
HE HAD A CUTE TRICK.
LET'S SEE
IF THIS IS HIM.
TRIPOLI, WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF MR. MOTO?
MOTO!
IT'S
THE SAME DOG!
I KNOW YOU BROUGHT HIM
ON BOARD.
ME?
YOU'LL GET
BUSTED FOR THIS.
ASK ME, SERGEANT.
HUH?
I DID IT.
YOU?
YEAH, ME.
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW
BETTER, WINOCKI.
WHY?
IT'S
AGAINST REGULATIONS.
YOU KNOW WHY
THIS DOG IS HERE.
HE HAD
THE SAME CHANCE
AS THOSE
MARINES ON WAKE.
GO AHEAD,
REPORT ME.
I'VE BEEN
BUSTED BEFORE.
I DID IT!
SHUT UP!
I'M GETTING SORE.
WE'RE GETTING KICKED
ALL OVER THE PLACE
AND YOU'RE YAPPING
ABOUT REGULATIONS!
YOU'RE CHANGING
YOUR TUNE.
I'D LIKE TO DO
SOME CHASING MYSELF.
GO ON,
TELL THEM!
I'VE HALF A MIND--
COME HERE.
WHY DID YOU
DO THAT?
PIPE DOWN.
HEY, LOOK WHAT'S HERE.
WHAT IS THIS,
SERGEANT, NOAH'S ARK?
WHO BROUGHT HIM
ON THIS AIRPLANE?
HE COULD HAVE
JUMPED ON.
YEAH, BUT HE DIDN'T.
YOU KNOW IT'S
AGAINST REGULATIONS.
YOU DON'T
KNOW WHO DID IT.
NO, SIR.
WE CAN'T VERY WELL
THROW HIM OUT NOW.
WE COULD TAKE
CARE OF HIM.
WE CAN?
WHO LIKES DOGS?
WINOCKI AND WEINBERG
LIKE DOGS, SIR.
THEY COULD TAKE
CARE OF HIM.
SERGEANT,
YOU TELL THEM.
YES, SIR.
IT'S GOING TO
BE TOUGH ON YOU.
WE CAN FIX THAT.
HE'S CUTE.
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
I THINK THEY
CALL HIM TRIPOLI.
AND HE DON'T
LIKE JAPS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MOTO?
SO YOU DON'T
LIKE MOTO.
WHAT IS THIS,
A FLYING DOGHOUSE?
HE DOESN'T LIKE
PURSUIT PILOTS.
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
MOTO.
HIYA, MOTO.
HEY, MOTO,
BE NICE, MOTO.
HE DOESN'T LIKE ME.
TRIPOLI, YOU'LL BE
USEFUL AROUND HERE.
TAKE GOOD
CARE OF HIM.
YES, SIR.
DID YOU TELL THEM
HOW TRIPOLI GOT ABOARD?
NO.
YOU DIDN'T?
I'M TELLING YOU TO
TAKE CARE OF HIM.
PILOT TO CREW,
WE'RE GOING TO 20,000.
BETTER CHECK
YOUR OXYGEN.
THERE YOU ARE, TRIPOLI.
HE SEEMS TO
LIKE IT ALL RIGHT.
HE AIN'T
PUTTING UP NO KICK.
JUST LIKE A BABY
ON A BOTTLE.
CLARK FIELD TO 05564.
WHAT'S YOUR POSITION?
WE'RE ABOUT
WHAT ARE
YOUR LANDING INSTRUCTIONS?
THE RUNWAY'S
PRETTY ROUGH.
THE JAPS JUST
HAD A PICNIC.
SOMEDAY,
WE'LL FIND A FLAT FIELD.
THOSE TRACTORS
ARE ON THE RUNWAY.
KEEP YOUR ALTITUDE.
DO NOT LAND.
SORRY, HAVE TO COME IN,
RUNNING OUT OF FUEL.
GET THOSE TRACTORS
OFF THAT RUNWAY!
COME IN LOW
OVER THE FENCE.
YOU HAVEN'T
MUCH ROOM.
WE'VE GOT THE FENCE.
TAKE A LOOK,
ROBBIE.
YES, SIR.
HI, MAJOR!
SAY, WHEN WE WERE
AT KELLEY FIELD,
DIDN'T I TEACH YOU HOW TO
GET OVER A FENCE?
I CUT IT TOO FINE.
NOT BAD AFTER 7,000
CONSECUTIVE MILES.
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
ALL OF YOU!
HI, RAIDER.
HI, SIR.
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'VE JOINED THE BOMBERS?
NO, SIR.
HE DOESN'T APPRECIATE
A GOOD AIRPLANE.
I DON'T LIKE
THEM SO BIG.
TAIL'S CLEAR, SIR.
NO DAMAGE.
TAKE HER DOWN
TO THE END,
GET HER A FULL LOAD OF GAS,
AND GET READY
FOR ACTION, IRISH.
YOU'RE GOING TO BE READY
TO TAKE OFF AT ANY TIME.
YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF,
YOU'RE WIDE OPEN
ON THE GROUND.
COLONEL BLAKE
WANTS TO SEE YOU.
I'LL PICK YOU UP SOON.
ALL RIGHT, SIR.
HOLD IT!
YOU GOT ANY
SECTIONAL MAPS?
NOT ENOUGH.
GO GRAB SOME.
TOMMY, HELP LOAD
THE BOMBS.
THANKS FOR
THE BUGGY RIDE.
O.K.
WEINBERG,
OPEN THE BOMB BAY.
PETERSON,
CHECK YOUR RADIO.
YOU TWO, HELP
WITH THE LOADING.
WINOCKI, SEE IF
THE LINE CHIEF WILL TRANSFER YOU.
WE'LL GET SOMEBODY
TO REPLACE YOU.
GET GOING.
I...
WINOCKI, YOU WANT TO
GET OUT OF THIS CREW?
ISN'T THAT WHAT
YOU WANT, SIR?
NOT NECESSARILY.
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.
I'M BEGINNING
TO REALIZE THAT--
TURN THAT DOG OVER
TO THE NEAREST MARINE.
GET BACK HERE
AND CHECK THOSE GUNS.
YES, SIR.
GET READY AS QUICK
AS YOU CAN, SERGEANT.
CAPTAIN, EXCUSE ME, SIR.
COULD YOU FIND OUT
SOMETHING ABOUT MY BOY?
SURE, I WILL,
SERGEANT.
HEY, BUDDY,
ARE YOU A MARINE?
WHAT'S IT TO YOU?
I GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU.
HIS NAME IS TRIPOLI.
FEED HIM GOOD.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
CALLAHAN. THANKS!
YOU ALL READY
UP THERE?
ALL READY.
LET HER GO!
WATCH IT.
STEADY.
KEEP HER LEVEL.
NOW TURN HER,
FELLOWS.
TURN HER.
MAKE IT SNAPPY.
THAT'S ABOUT IT.
TAKE STRAIN ON.
TAKE IT AWAY.
THAT'S THE SITUATION,
AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW.
THE FACT IS, WE'VE
TAKEN AN AWFUL LICKING
BECAUSE WE WERE
CAUGHT ON THE GROUND.
THEY'VE OUTNUMBERED US
TEN TO ONE.
YET, EVERY TIME WE'VE BEEN
UP AGAINST THEM,
THEY'VE LOST FIVE
TO OUR ONE.
IF WE WERE NEAR EQUAL,
WE COULD LICK THEM.
WE'LL KEEP FIGHTING
WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT.
TILL WE CAN GET
ENOUGH AIRPLANES
TO BLAST THEM
OFF THE EARTH.
HOW LONG SINCE
YOU'VE SLEPT, CAPTAIN?
WE HAVEN'T HAD
MUCH TIME FOR THAT.
THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS
CONTINUOUS FLYING.
YOU'VE DONE
A GOOD JOB.
I'VE GOT
A GOOD CREW.
I BELIEVE IT.
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
WHAT DID YOU
FIND, MORAN?
IT LOOKS LIKE
AN INVASION FLEET.
WHAT'S IN IT?
THEY'VE GOT
SOME DESTROYERS WITH THEM.
WHERE?
THEY'RE
ABOUT 40 MILES OFF LINGAYEN.
I DIDN'T HAVE
MUCH TIME TO WAIT.
THE SKY SUDDENLY
GOT FULL OF ZEROS.
SO I HEADED
FOR HOME.
HERE'S THE POSITION
AND COURSE.
A FLIGHT OF B-17s
COULD WORK, SIR.
WE HAVEN'T GOT
A FLIGHT OF B-17s.
WE'VE GOT ONE B-17
LOADING UP NOW.
YES, SIR.
WANT TO TACKLE IT?
STUDY THIS FIRST,
DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES.
MORAN WILL GIVE YOU
ALL THE DOPE.
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
ONE THING MORE.
I TOLD OUR CREW CHIEF
I'D FIND OUT ABOUT HIS SON,
DANNY WHITE.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME?
HE WAS KILLED
THE FIRST DAY.
THAT'S A SHAME.
GIVE THESE TO ROBBIE.
I'VE KNOWN HIM
FOR A LONG TIME.
HOW DID IT
HAPPEN, SIR?
CAPTAIN ANDERSON CAN
TELL YOU MORE THAN I CAN.
HE SAW THE WHOLE THING.
YES, SIR.
FIND OUT
ANYTHING, SIR?
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?
HE WAS TRYING
TO TAKE OFF.
BEFORE HE COULD GET
HIS WHEELS OFF THE GROUND,
THEY HIT THE RUNWAY
IN FRONT OF HIM WITH A BIG ONE.
DIDN'T EVEN
GET INTO THE AIR.
IT'S NOT MUCH
TO SHOW FOR 20 YEARS,
IS IT, SIR?
GET THAT AIRPLANE UP!
ALL RIGHT, SERGEANT,
LET'S GO.
YES, SIR.
CLOSE THE BOMB BAY.
HOW MANY LOADED?
THREE, SIR.
ALL BIG ONES.
YES.
THOUSAND POUNDERS?
GOOD.
LET'S GET THIS THING
OUT OF HERE!
TAKE IT AWAY.
DOORS ARE CLOSED.
EVERYTHING ALL SET, SIR.
WHEELS UP.
WHEELS UP.
MONK, WHAT DO
YOU MAKE IT?
O.K., 331.
BETTER PUT ON
YOUR CHUTE, ROBBIE.
YES, SIR.
NAVIGATOR TO PILOT.
WE'RE ABOUT 30 MILES
OFF THE COAST.
BETTER GET OFF,
WE'LL TAKE A LOOK.
O.K., GOING DOWN.
FIGHTERS!
PILOT TO CREW,
THERE'S A FLOCK
OF ZEROS AHEAD AT 2:00.
ABOUT 3,000 FEET
ABOVE US.
THERE'S ANOTHER
BUNCH AT 10:00!
TAKE YOUR TIME.
SING OUT IF THEY
GET ON HER TAIL.
MAKE IT COUNT.
WE'VE GOT A LOT TO GET EVEN FOR.
HERE THEY COME!
COMING OVER!
THEY BREAK UP
IN PIECES!
WINOCKI,
ONE AT 9:00 COMING DOWN.
COMING OVER!
GREAT!
TAKE IT LEFT!
RIGHT!
HEY, JOE,
FRIED JAP GOING DOWN!
GAS LINE ON TWO.
GAS LINE ON TWO.
OIL LINE'S BURNING.
WE'LL HAVE TO BAIL OUT.
PILOT TO CREW--
YOU HURT, IRISH?
YEAH.
PILOT TO CREW, ABANDON SHIP.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
TOMMY, GET RID
OF YOUR SITE.
YOU AND MONK
GO OUT THE BOMB BAY.
I'LL USE
THE ESCAPE HATCH.
THEY'LL HAVE TO DRAG
THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN
TO GET THIS.
OPEN THE ESCAPE HATCH,
I'LL THROW IT OUT.
IRISH.
GET OUT!
YOU'RE 20 MILES
NORTHWEST OF THE FIELD.
GET OUT!
GO AHEAD,
PETERSON.
WEINBERG.
I DON'T LIKE THIS.
GO ON.
ALL RIGHT, KID.
WINOCKI.
GO AHEAD.
I'M COMING.
O.K.
EMERGENCY LANDING.
THERE, SIR!
ONE ENGINE'S BURNING!
GET YOUR WHEELS DOWN!
CAN'T DO IT,
GEAR'S JAMMED.
IT WON'T COME DOWN!
WELL.
I JUST LOOKED
AT THAT B-17.
COUNTED OVER
TWO MOTORS HIT,
PROPS ARE BENT,
CONTROLS IN A MESS,
WHEELS DAMAGED,
FUEL TANKS
ARE PUNCTURED,
ONE WING TIP GONE.
I DON'T SEE HOW
SHE WAS BROUGHT DOWN IN ONE PIECE.
IF WE HAD 10 DAYS
AND PLENTY
OF SPARE PARTS,
WE MIGHT MAKE HER
FLY AGAIN.
I DON'T KNOW THAT
WE'LL HAVE 24 HOURS.
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL
WRITE HER OFF.
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL DESTROY HER.
NO FIRES TONIGHT,
THEY'LL HIT US AGAIN.
JOE, SEND OUT
A DEMOLITION SQUAD
IN THE MORNING.
SO LONG.
WHAT ABOUT THE CREW?
THE CREW GOT BACK
ALL RIGHT, SIR.
THEY'RE OVER
AT THE HOSPITAL.
QUINCANNON ASKED
TO SEE THEM.
HOW'S HE?
THAT'S TOO BAD.
YEAH.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT RIFLE, TEX?
I PICKED UP TOO MANY SLUGS.
I'M A FOOT SOLDIER NOW.
THEY FINALLY
GOT HIM WHERE HE BELONGS.
THEY WERE AFRAID
HE WOULDN'T
LEAVE ANY JAPS TO SURRENDER.
WINOCKI.
THEY SAID
YOU BROUGHT HER IN.
HE DID, SIR.
SHE CAME IN
HERSELF.
I JUST
SAT THERE.
IT WAS A GOOD JOB.
SHE'S ALL RIGHT,
HUH?
SHE'S...
SHE'S ALL RIGHT,
ISN'T SHE?
ROBBIE.
YES, SIR?
SHE'LL FLY AGAIN?
SURE.
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HER, ROBBIE?
OH, UH...PROPS,
GEAR, WING TIP.
JUST A TIP?
WHAT'S A WING TIP?
A FEW DAYS.
TWO DAYS?
YES, SIR.
BUT SHE
WILL FLY AGAIN.
YEAH.
THAT'S FINE.
GET AS MANY MEN
AS YOU NEED.
THE COLONEL WILL
GIVE THEM TO YOU.
I'LL GET CLEARANCE,
WE'LL LEAVE RIGHT AWAY.
WE'VE GOT TO HURRY.
NURSE!
EASY.
EASY, IRISH.
GET THE DOCTOR.
NO, THE DOCTOR CAN'T GO.
REGULATIONS.
BESIDES, WE ALREADY GOT
ONE PASSENGER.
IS HE HERE,
THAT PURSUIT PILOT?
HERE, SIR.
O.K., START THEM, BILL.
SURE, IRISH.
EVERYBODY IN, CHIEF?
ALL IN, SIR.
DOORS CLOSED?
YES, SIR.
HERE WE GO.
LOCK THEM.
LOCKED.
WHEELS UP.
COMING UP.
SOUND LIKE THEY'RE RUNNING
ALL RIGHT, ROBBIE?
YES, SIR.
PILOT TO NAVIGATOR.
GO AHEAD.
MONK...
MONK, WHAT'S OUR COURSE?
DUE EAST, SKIPPER.
THAT'S...
THAT'S RIGHT
INTO THE SUNRISE.
RIGHT INTO THE...
THE SUNRISE.
OVER HERE, MAJOR.
THAT'S ALL, BOYS.
WELL, LET'S
GET GOING, FELLOWS.
WE GOT A LOT TO DO.
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
CORPORAL?
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.
ME AND THE SQUAD THINKERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.
WHAT?
WE WAS DETAILED TO BURN
THEM BUSTED AIRPLANES.
DID YOU BURN THEM?
THEM JAPS ARE STEALING
THEM, SIR.
DON'T TALK NONSENSE.
THOSE ARE SNIPERS.
THEY'RE NOT STEALING
AIRPLANES.
NOW WAIT A MINUTE.
LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT.
YOU HAD TO DEMOLISH
FIVE B-17s.
YES, SIR.
WHAT IS IT?
THEY'RE MISSING.
PARTS OF THEM?
YES, SIR.
THERE'S A WRECKED B-17.
THE ONE THEY CALL
THE MARY-ANN.
HAVE YOU BURNED IT?
NO, SIR.
WHY NOT?
I WANTED TO
MAKE A REPORT.
WELL, NOW,
GO BURN IT.
YES, SIR.
WHAT WAS HE
TALKING ABOUT?
I DON'T KNOW.
I BETTER LOOK.
I'LL GO WITH YOU.
THERE'S WHAT
WE'RE MISSING.
HOW'S IT COMING,
CHIEF?
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, WEINBERG, LOWER AWAY.
HEY, SARGE,
ARE THE GUNS LOADED?
SURE THEY ARE.
ANY BOMBS IN?
NO.
GET DOWN.
GET AWAY
FROM ME.
WE'RE GOING TO
BURN THIS.
YOU GUYS
GET THE LIVE AMMUNITION OUT.
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE!
YOU'RE BURNING
THIS PLANE?
THE COLONEL SAID
TO BURN IT.
GET YOUR STUFF
OUT.
BOYS, BRING IN
THE GAS.
GET THIS GASOLINE AWAY.
HEY, BUTCH!
WEINBERG!
I THOUGHT YOU
WAS IN JERSEY.
I WISHED I WAS.
DON'T BURN IT.
I GOT ORDERS.
WEINBERG...
GET HIM AWAY
BEFORE HE GETS HURT.
ORDERS IS ORDERS.
FROM WHO?
THE C.O.
TELL THE C.O. TO...
LOOK AT THIS AIRPLANE.
I'M LOOKING AT IT.
THERE'S NO REASON
TO BURN THIS AIRPLANE.
SHE'LL BE
AS GOOD AS NEW.
BETTER, SIR.
WE'VE BEEN WORKING
ON HER ALL NIGHT.
WE'LL HAVE HER
FLYING IN 24 HOURS.
OUR JOB IS TO
DESTROY EVERYTHING
THAT WILL BE USEFUL
TO THOSE JAPS.
WE CAN'T
MOVE ANY GAS.
GET SOME DRUMS.
YOU CAN'T
GET THAT READY IN TIME.
BOMBSIGHT STILL
IN THIS AIRPLANE?
YES, SIR.
THE ONE WE BORROWED.
WE WON'T LET THEM
TAKE IT.
GIVE US
A CHANCE.
I'VE BEEN IN
THE ARMY OVER 20 YEARS.
THIS IS
MY FIRST FAVOR.
WE'LL BURN HER
OURSELVES IF WE CAN'T MAKE IT.
YOU'RE CRAZY.
YOU KNOW WHAT'LL HAPPEN
IF THE JAPS COME?
YES, SIR.
YOU'LL BURN IT?
YES, SIR.
YES, SIR.
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S YOUR FUNERAL.
FORGET IT, CORPORAL.
THANK YOU, SIR.
THAT OBSERVATION
PLANE IS READY TO GO.
WE'LL NEED
A GUNNER.
I'LL NEED A GUNNER
FOR A FEW HOURS.
I CAN GO.
WAIT A MINUTE.
I'D RATHER GO, SIR.
GO AHEAD.
YES, SIR.
THAT KID'S
AWFULLY GREEN.
GIVE US A HAND!
O.K.
LEAVING THE
MARY-ANN IS BAD LUCK.
SWING IT
AROUND WIDE.
PUT SOME MUSCLE.
WHERE'D YOU FIND
THAT LITTLE BEAST?
BEAST?
HE'S A MARINE CORPS DOG.
I KNOW.
HIYA, MOTO.
MOTO, CUT IT OUT!
GET HIM AWAY,
SERGEANT!
I'D RATHER NOT
GET HYDROPHOBIA.
HIS NAME AIN'T MOTO.
HIS NAME IS TRIPOLI.
WHAT!
MAYBE HE DON'T LIKE
BEING CALLED MOTO.
THAT'S IT.
CUTE TRICK, AIN'T IT?
YEAH, VERY CUTE.
HOW'S IT GOING,
RAIDER?
THEY'RE WITHDRAWING
TO BATAAN.
I THOUGHT IF I CAME
BACK HERE,
I COULD GET
AN AIRPLANE.
FAT CHANCE.
WE'VE GOT
ONE 0-47 LEFT.
THEY'VE GOT AIRPLANES
AT BATAVIA OR PORT DARWIN.
HOW ABOUT THAT B-17
I CAME IN ON?
THAT CRAZY OUTFIT?
THEY'RE
WORKING ON IT
FROM OTHER WRECKS.
IT WILL NEVER FLY.
CAN I HELP, SIR?
DON'T YOU KNOW
WHAT'S IMPOSSIBLE?
THANK YOU, SIR.
HEY!
CAN I HELP TOO,
SIR?
GO TO--
HELP, SIR?
THANK YOU, SIR.
HELLO, WEINBERG.
THOUGHT YOU WAS
IN THE INFANTRY.
HARD ON
THE FEET.
THINGS GET
TOO TOUGH?
I CAME TO HELP.
HOW YOU DOING
WITH MOTO?
FINE,
WITH  TRIPOLI.
I KNEW IT ALL ALONG.
SURE.
SURE.
LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE
YOURSELVES A JOB.
HOW ABOUT USING ME
AND THE MARINE?
YOU ASKING TO
JOIN THIS CREW?
I'D RATHER FLY
THAN WALK.
CHANGED
YOUR MIND?
NO,
BUT I'LL WORK.
STOP GRINNING
AND TELL ME WHAT TO DO.
YOU'RE SERIOUS?
SURE.
WE NEED GAS.
YES, SIR.
TAKE THE MARINE CORPS
WITH YOU.
O.K., CALLAHAN.
WATCH IT.
PICK UP THE END.
THAT'S GOT HER.
WHERE'S WEINBERG?
HE WENT FOR OIL.
HEY, THOSE ARE
JAP PLANES!
GET GOING, MEN.
GET ON THE GUNS!
BRING SOME MORE
AMMUNITION.
GOOD WORK, ROBBIE!
DON'T TALK. SHOOT.
ANOTHER!
YOU DOG!
MONK, THEY'RE
AFTER THE KID.
THEY'LL GET HIM
ON THE WAY DOWN.
LOOK OUT, KID!
WAIT HERE,
WEINBERG.
DIRTY...
WE'D BETTER
GET HIM BACK NOW.
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
GET ON THIS LEG.
ALL TOGETHER, HEAVE!
THERE SHE IS,
SIR.
IS THERE ROOM
FOR A GUN?
I'LL SHOW YOU.
HAND ME THE GUN.
WHEN I GET IN.
IT'LL WORK
ALL RIGHT.
THE JAPS WILL
BE SURPRISED AT THIS B-17.
WHAT ABOUT
THE TAIL WHEEL?
I CAN
GET THROUGH.
GOT A FULL
BOMB LOAD, TOMMY?
FULL TO THE GILLS.
LIEUTENANT, HAND ME
THAT AMMUNITION, WILL YOU?
COMING UP.
GIVE US A HAND.
COME ON.
HERE WE GO.
GET A COUPLE
OF PLANKS.
THEY'RE GETTING
CLOSER, SIR.
WE'LL HAVE TO GO
BY DAYLIGHT.
WE WILL!
IT'S ALMOST
WEINBERG FINISHED
NUMBER THREE.
IF RAIDER DOESN'T
GET BACK SOON--
HEY!
WHO IS IT?
PETERSON, CALLAHAN!
WE GOT YOUR GAS.
A WHOLE TRUCKLOAD.
HOW CAN WE GET IT
FROM THOSE DRUMS?
LIEUTENANT RAIDER'S
BRINGING SOLDIERS.
WHERE DO YOU
WANT IT, BILL?
RIGHT WHERE
IT IS.
LET'S GET
THESE DRUMS OUT.
SNAP INTO IT, FELLOWS.
SOME OF YOU GO BEHIND.
GOOD WORK, BOYS,
KEEP THEM GOING.
STEP ON IT.
DON'T SLOP IT.
HANDLE THOSE
CANS CAREFUL.
DON'T SLOP IT
AROUND THE PLANE.
KEEP THEM LEVEL.
COME ON,
UP HERE.
O.K., SARGE,
NUMBER FOUR WILL RUN.
RAIDER,
GET THE COWLING ON.
GOING ON.
LIEUTENANT,
ENGINES ARE READY.
GOOD WORK.
TEX--
TOO CLOSE.
HURRY IT UP.
DON'T SPILL IT.
FASTER WITH
THOSE BUCKETS.
LIEUTENANT!
THEY'RE COMING
IN THROUGH THERE.
GET EVERYTHING CLEAR
TO TAKE OFF.
HOLD THAT GAS.
GIVE US A HAND
MOVING THIS SHIP.
GET THIS STUFF
OUT OF HERE.
GET INSIDE,
START HER UP.
WINOCKI,
GET ON THE GUN.
JOHNNY,
ON THE BOMB SIGHT.
IF IT WON'T START,
WE'LL BURN HER.
COME ON, LET'S GO!
GET ON THIS TAIL.
COME ON, NOW,
SHOVE HER.
HEY!
HOLD IT!
ALL RIGHT,
GO AHEAD.
ALL RIGHT,
KEEP GOING.
O.K.
WEINBERG,
HELP RAIDER.
O.K., TURN HER AROUND.
THAT'S ENOUGH.
HOLD IT.
TAKE HER AROUND.
ALL RIGHT
NOW, PUSH.
TAKE HER AROUND.
GOOD, THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S FAR ENOUGH.
GET GOING,
SOLDIERS.
KEEP CLEAR OF THE PROPS.
START IT, LIEUTENANT.
O.K., STAY CLEAR.
GET EVERYBODY
OUT OF THAT SHIP!
BRING OVER
THAT GASOLINE!
COME ON,
COME ON!
HIT IT.
NO.
HOLD IT!
GET OUT
OF THERE!
KEEP CLEAR.
GET AWAY.
ALL RIGHT, TEX.
GIVE IT
TO HER.
WHEELS UP.
COMING UP.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, SIR.
IT'S THIS ONE,
ROBBIE.
THAT'S EASY.
HOW ARE
WE DOING?
FINE, FOR A PLANE
THEY SAID WOULDN'T FLY.
HOW'S OUR
FUEL CONSUMPTION?
O.K. WE'LL MAKE
AUSTRALIA.
PETERSON HEARD
ON THE RADIO
THERE'S A JAP INVASION FLEET
HEADED FOR AUSTRALIA.
OUR PACIFIC FLEET
IS HUNTING FOR THEM.
I WISH THEM LUCK.
TEX, YOU'RE
A FUNNY-LOOKING THING
TO BE FLYING A B-17.
I HOPE THEY GOT
P-40s IN DARWIN.
HE PROBABLY SHOT ME
TO GET THAT SEAT.
I'D ONLY SHOOT YOU
TO GET OUT OF IT.
WHY DON'T
YOU SLEEP?
WE GOT OUT
OF THE HABIT.
JOE, WILL THAT
TAIL GUN WORK?
WAIT AND SEE.
SARGE, WILL WE STOP
AT MINDANAO?
WE'VE ALREADY
PASSED THERE.
YEAH?
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU CAN WORK THAT GUN.
THINK A MARINE
USES A BOW AND ARROW?
WOULDN'T PUT IT
PAST THEM.
NAVIGATOR TO PILOT.
LOOK DOWN BELOW,
ON THE LEFT.
HOLY SMOKE!
LOOK AT THAT.
JACKPOT!
HERE WE GO AGAIN.
WHAT DO WE DO?
PULL UP.
HEY, WHERE ARE
WE GOING?
HOLD YOUR HORSES.
THIS IS A WAR, NOT A FIGHT.
PILOT TO RADIO.
HEAR THAT, PETERSON?
WRITE IT DOWN--
CONTACT ALL
AREA AIR BASES.
TELL THEM WE'VE SIGHTED
A JAP TASK FORCE HEADED SOUTH.
GIVE THEM
THAT POSITION.
TELL THEM WE'RE HIDING
IN THE CLOUDS.
RADIO TO PILOT.
GO AHEAD,
PETERSON.
ARMY AND NAVY PLANES
REACHED THE POSITION.
THEIR FORMATION LEADER
IS CALLING YOU.

DID YOU
GET HIT?
SURE,
I GOT HIT.
WATCH OUT!
DID YOU SEE THAT?
WANT A CIGAR?
COMING IN
ON OUR TAIL.
OUR TAIL
HAS A STINGER.
WHICH ONE,

TAKE THAT CARRIER
STRAIGHT AHEAD.
O.K.
LIKE THE BOMBER NOW?

HALF OUR GAS.
ATTENTION!

AND OUT.
WILLIAMS, LEAD
THE FIRST SECTION.
RAIDER, THE SECOND.
HAUSER, NAVIGATE
FOR THE ENTIRE SQUADRON.
McMARTIN WILL TALK
TO YOUR BOMBARDIERS.
ANY QUESTIONS?
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S ALL.
GOOD LUCK,
AND GIVE 'EM HELL.
WE SHALL CARRY THE ATTACK  AGAINST THE ENEMY.
WE SHALL HIT HIM
AND HIT HIM AGAIN,
WHEREVER AND WHENEVER
WE CAN REACH HIM,
FOR WE INTEND TO BRING
THIS BATTLE TO HIM
ON HIS OWN HOME GROUNDS.
