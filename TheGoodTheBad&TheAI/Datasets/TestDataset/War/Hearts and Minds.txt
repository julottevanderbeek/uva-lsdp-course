When the Second World War was over,
we were the one great power
in the world.
The Soviets had
a substantial military machine,
but they could not touch us in power.
We had this enormous force
that had been built up.
We had the greatest fleet
in the world.
We'd come through the war
economically sound.
And I think that, in addition
to feeling a sense of responsibility,
we also began to feel...
the-the sense of a world power,
that possibly we could control
the future of the world.
Dressed up to win
We're dressed up to win
Dressed up for victory
We are just beginning
and we won't stop winning
Till the world is free
This time we will all make certain
That this time is the last time
This time we will not say curtains
Till we bring it down
in their own hometown
For this time we are out to finish
The job we started then
Clean it up for all times
this time
So we won't have to do it again
Our vision of progress
is not limited to our own country.
We extend it
to all the peoples of the world.
I do not expect that there is going
to be a communist victory in Indochina.
I affirm that Secretary Dulles...
offered me two atomic bombs.
Two, uh...
Neither one, neither three.
Two.
If Indochina goes,
several things happen right away.
The Accra Peninsula, the little bit
of end hanging on down there...
would be scarcely defensible.
The tin and the tungsten...
that we so greatly value from that area
would cease coming.
We don't see the end of the tunnel,
but, uh, I must say...
I don't think it's darker
than it was a year ago,
in some ways lighter. Yes?
So we must be ready
to fight in Vietnam,
but the ultimate victory
will depend upon the hearts...
and the minds of the people
who actually live out there.
Throughout the war in Vietnam,
the United States has exercised
a degree of restraint...
unprecedented
in the annals of war.
one small word that enabled
myself and my buddies...
to stay alive those many years.
That one thing was faith.
Faith in my family,
my God and my country.
I remembered high school.
I remembered playing sports there.
And I can remember
my coach saying--
''When the going gets tough,
the tough get going,
At that time, communism was once again
trying to muscle its way...
into a free country.
that would assert that there's
a majority of people in that country...
that want to be communist.
Because they were subjected to, uh,
military attack from outside.
Uh, the, uh--
Are you really asking me
this goddamn silly question?
You really want me to go into this?
-
I mean--I mean, you know,
we really got to go back to--
You just want me to go back
to the origins of this thing then.
All right, I'll do it, but this is
pretty pedestrian stuff, I must say,
at this late stage of the game.
Honestly it is.
I'll do it. All right.
-
- No, there's not.
No, there's not.
There's no doubt.
All right, I'll answer your question,
you can throw away that tape.
I didn't expect to have to go back
to this kind of sophomoric stuff,
but I'll do it.
The problem, uh, began, uh,
in its present phase,
after the Sputnik,
the launch of the Sputnik
in 1957, October.
This opened a phase
of not well-coordinated,
but universally optimistic
and hopeful communist enterprise...
in many parts of the world.
Renewed hostile actions...
against United States ships on
the high seas in the Gulf of Tonkin...
have today required me to order
military forces of the United States...
to take action in reply.
We always hesitate in public to use
the word ''lie,'' but a lie is a lie.
I mean,
it's a misrepresentation of fact.
And it's supposed to be a criminal act
if its done under oath.
Mr.Johnson didn't say it under oath,
he just said it.
We don't usually have
the president under oath.
There are those who ask
why this responsibility should be ours.
The answer, I think, is simple.
There is no one else
who can do the job.
If necessary,
I am ready to go back.
We all must be ready.
You must have the political, economic
and philosophical courage to send me...
or do whatever you think
is necessary.
it is only because
Linden did well in bringing me up...
and making me into a man.
If I served the military well,
it is only because the military
trained me to be a good officer.
If I am a good American,
it is only because America
brought me up to be a good American.
---
-
It was a sight to touch
the heart of the most callous.
Lieutenant George Coker was back in
Linden, New Jersey, the hero of the day.
and streets were blocked
as the young former prisoner of war...
walked on a red carpet
to the steps of city hall.
--
I'm from Duncan, Oklahoma,
which is about 90 miles south of here.
And, uh, and I lived
around several places--
uh, Missouri, Chicago,
Detroit, uh, Germany,
Uh...
by the time I got out of high school,
I was very conservative.
We have, in Duncan high school--
we bought--
the high school had bought a, uh...
Excuse me--
a John Birch package on communism.
So we studied communism
via the John Birch Society,
the big red map with the flowing out
of the disease and so forth,
and-and learned how Karl Marx
was a very cruel man...
and used to, uh,
make his family suffer and so forth.
Uh, so when I got out of high school,
I thought basically that, um,
Teddy Roosevelt's
what this country needed,
and F.D.R. had kind of
sold us down the drain to the commies.
The communist conspiracy is a deliberate
and predictable plan of action...
to subvert the world.
It's an international,
criminal conspiracy.
Before we know it, we're gonna
turn our backs around someday,
the whole United States, we're gonna
turn around and see nothing but V.C.--
or not V.C., but communism--we're gonna
turn around and say, ''What happened?''
People just walking in
with riots, drugs, you name it.
They're tearing us down
from the inside out.
In 1917, when the communists
overthrew the Russian government,
there was 1 communist
for every 2,277 persons...
in Russia.
In the United States today,
there is one communist...
for every 1 ,81 4 persons
in this country.
If we lose Indochina, Mr.Jenkins,
we will lose the Pacific,
and we'll be an island
in a communist sea.
- Go ahead, how does it go?
- Oh, mother.
I swear that I am not now...
or ever have been a member
of the communist party.
Feel better?
Of course, when it gets down
to communism, uh,
I've been fighting communism
since 1 951 , actually.
I was looked at, you know,
the American fighting man,
as being, uh, you know,
like a warrior of sorts,
you know, due to my background,
the way my mother
brought me up.
She always spoke of
the warrior societies of our tribe...
and of the different tribes around us
and how that these men...
always had to work to gain the respect
of the people around them...
and how they had to live, uh,
more or less a life dictated to them...
by the society that they belonged to,
and it was extremely hard.
I-I looked around and from listening
to my uncles and a lot of my relations--
they had been in the Marine Corps--
and they always told me that...
the Marine Corps was the hardest service
to cope with physically and mentally.
And I naturally wanted to be
the best at that time,
and I looked at the Marine Corps
as being the elite of the elite,
the warrior society
in the United States.
Now it might sound cliché-ish
to say that,
''My country,
may it always be right,
but right or wrong,
my country.''
But that's how
I felt back in '67.
And during my senior year,
I said I've got
an obligation to serve.
I've got to fulfill it.
There's no reason physically
why I would be exempted,
and therefore,
I'm gonna enlist.
- What you got there?
- Picture.
Picture?
How much picture?
- Three thousand?
- I go beaucoup hungry. I sell 3,000.
- You go here, too much money.
- I buy watch for 1 ,500.
No, you sell to me?
You lie. You lie, you die.
-You give massage? What else you give?
- Yes.
-
- Huh?
- I buy you one beer, okay?
- You-You buy me one beer?
No, no. No money.
Go home,
- Please, go home,
-
- No. Go home,
-
No. Go home,
Okay? No. Go home,
- You will like.
- No. No.
- Huh?
-
- How much?
- One thousand.
You? Ah, it's too much.
Beaucoup.
Yeah, for sure. No, no good.
-
-
- No. No.
-
- No. Go home,
We thought of ourselves, I think,
as trying to defeat communists.
Defeat--Accepting a view of, uh--
the Walt Rostow kind of view--
of covert aggression
of some kind.
The kind of view that enabled you
to think of the conflict...
It had an idealistic flavor to it,
but it was the underpinning of
an imperial policy, basically.
I shared the assumption,
very easily,
and felt it as an idealistic one really.
We were doing something for them.
I recall that I was in the New York area
at the time,
and I stopped by
to see General MacArthur,
who I had known for several years.
Uh, when he greeted me, he made, uh,
quite a prophetic statement.
He said, ''Westmoreland,
I-I see you have a new job.''
He said, ''I hope you appreciate
that this new assignment...
is filled with opportunities,
but fraught with hazards.''
And indeed, uh,
this was a prophetic statement.
It can be described much like, uh...
a-a-a singer doing an aria...
that's totally into what he's doing,
you know, totally feeling it.
He knows the aria,
and he's experiencing the aria.
And he knows his limits, and he knows
whether he's doing it and doing it well.
Flying an aircraft
can be a great deal like that.
What's a race driver feel like?
Why does a guy want to drive
in the Indianapolis 500?
I guess, perhaps, the risk of dying,
being killed is part of it
that makes it thrilling.
I would follow a pathway on something
like a TV screen in front of me...
that would direct me
right, left or center--
follow the steering,
keep the steering symbol, uh, centered.
I'd see a little attack light
when we'd stepped into attack.
I could pull the ''commit'' switch
on my stick,
and the computer took over.
A computer figured out the ballistics,
the airspeed, the slant range...
So it was very much of
a technical expertise thing.
I was a good pilot, you know.
I had, uh, uh,
I had a lot of pride
in my ability to fly.
You're up there
doing something that, uh,
mankind has only dreamed of; the flying,
especially at night, in an aircraft.
The A-6 is one of the few
that can really do it the way we did it.
Um, a World War II aviator would not
even dream of doing the things we did.
It's definitely
the ultimate in aviation.
Almost everybody
has blown off firecrackers.
You put something in the can
and watch the can blow up in the air.
You get there, have a real good mission,
hit your target,
find out later your target
was totally destroyed,
that it wasn't one of these misses
or almost, you got it.
And come back and make a night carrier
landing recovery. Uh, that's fantastic.
To say it's thrilling,
yes, it's deeply satisfying.
-
-
-
Mm.
If you wanted to later, you might.
But it was all business.
It's, um,just strictly professionalism.
We had a job to do
and we did it.
Never could see the people.
You never could see--
Occasionally you saw the houses when
you were bombing around a village...
or bombing in a village.
Uh, you never
heard the explosion.
You never saw any blood or any screams.
It was very clean.
-
-
This war is a war against
the American imperialists.
This is our war for independence.
-
-
What we are trying to put across this
afternoon is to get you to realize...
that these weren't mythical,
hazy people from the past.
These were very real people.
When they rose up against
the most powerful army in the world,
they were actually putting
everything on the line that they had:
their homes, their wealth,
their past and their future.
And when you judge the Revolution
and the problems and the success we had,
it was a two-way street.
A good many citizens
at the time of the Revolution...
actually stayed
and fought with the British.
It was close to being a civil war
in many areas.
You actually split
many-many families.
Thomas Jefferson said,
''The tree of revolution is--''
or ''The tree of liberty is...
watered by the blood of revolution
every generation.''
And I think that's a little exaggerated,
but there's some truth to that.
Men are getting killed, men are killing.
That's the parallel.
As far as politics, are you kidding?
Oriental politics?
Don't put me on, man.
-
- No, sir.
-
-
Of course,
the name for a conflict...
in which you're opposing a revolution
is counter-revolution.
And this is something
We never admitted to ourselves at all.
It's-It's what we were really doing.
--
The-The-The pathos, almost,
the sadness--
Here's a man who felt
and believed the United States...
would be sympathetic to his purpose
of gaining his independence...
from a colonial power.
And then to find we--
You know, this is what he'd read.
He'd been here, read our Constitution
and Declaration of Independence.
He thought surely the United States
would be interested.
We had testimony in the committee
that his one worry...
was that
it was so insignificant--
Vietnam was so far away, insignificant--
we would never bother about it.
It's too small to ever attract
the attention of the United States.
The Ho Chi Minh of'56,
I don't think could have got elected
dogcatcher in South Vietnam.
Ho Chi Minh, uh, dead--
could beat any candidate
we've ever put up in Vietnam.
And he was  a soldier at heart.
Uh, but he realized,
I'm sure, there's no question,
he realized he was part of a big job
that had to be done,
and he was gonna do it
the way he did everything--full out.
--
--
to this area just south of Da Nang
along the railroad line.
And they encountered heavy, sustained,
uh, automatic weapons fire.
And the helicopter ahead of him,
I believe,
was, uh, uh, destr--
was shot down.
And then he went in
and his helicopter was, uh, uh--
He was actually killed in flight.
That's what they--
And the airplane crashed,
and he and his co--He was killed.
His copilot was very badly injured.
And I think there were 1 2
out of 1 5 or 1 6 of the people aboard...
were either killed or badly hurt.
- Come on.
-
- You look nice.
- How do you feel?
What'd you do?
Uh, shaved.
I liked it better long.
So what you been doing?
I'll be going back to the military.
Why?
- --
After what they've done to you?
--
it's a choice between that...
or, uh, Canada, again.
Or, uh, staying underground.
Which is, uh, as you know,
impossible--
-
- No.
No. But I've got a lot of support.
Yeah?
It's really been building up
over the past couple of months.
- --
- Am I going to be able to be there?
Of course you're going to be there.
I'm gonna try to get Ronnie there, too.
These people holding their heads high
because they lost a son...
in Vietnam or something.
I don't think
that's much to be proud of.
They've lost more than they'll ever gain
for the rest of their lives.
And I remember
I was sitting at the base of the hill,
and I was on one of the tanks.
And I had an M-1 6,
and I had stacks of magazines.
And there were two guys, you know,
that were going through,
like, some grass and bam!
I dinged in on one of'em,
and I nailed him, you know.
And the Aussie with me confirmed,
you know, that I dinged him.
And I felt good.
And I wanted more.
And it wasn't that I wanted more
for politics or anything like that.
No. I couldn't of cared
if they were whatever.
I just wanted them because
they were the opposition, the enemy.
Stinking little savages.
Wipe 'em out, I say.
Wipe 'em out.
Wipe 'em off the face of the earth!
Will we ever understand
these Eastern races?
Hit me, Poon Soon.
You hideous yellow monster!
I wanted to go out
and kill some gooks, you know?
I-I really--I-I don't know. I guess
I had been totally brainwashed,
because I could remember when
people used to call me ''blanket ass''...
or ''chief'
and they still did, you know?
I think my name was, uh,
Ira Hayes in boot camp.
Either Ira Hayes or squaw, depending on
what mood the drill instructor was in.
But there I was, you know,
saying I wanted to go kill some gooks.
They were instructed
to remove the eyes of the individual...
and place them in a hole
in the middle of the back,
and that would say to the Vietnamese,
you have to understand,
uh, that whoever did that
was ubiquitous.
In other words,
the eye being the symbol of ubiquity,
uh, or of all-present, all-powerfulness
on the part of the Saigon government.
Which is an easy message
for the local villagers to get.
In fact, the American advisors didn't
have that much of a stomach for it.
So they used to use CBS logos.
You know, the eye of CBS?
And they would kill the individual
and then they would leave him...
with kind of a calling card on him.
''If you don't tell us
what we want to know,
we're gonna throw you
out of the helicopter.''
And, uh, he couldn't respond.
He didn't understand.
They were using, uh, pigeon Vietnamese,
which he didn't understand.
It was more English
than Vietnamese.
They'd run him up to the helicopter--
two hefty E.M. were along--
they'd take him by each elbow and run
him up to the door of the helicopter.
They'd do this three or four times.
He was reduced to whimpering and crying.
And they finally, um,
uh, told him that this was the last run.
He still responded the same way, and
they winged him out of the helicopter.
The second fellow
immediately started to babble.
Anything he could tell them.
Any kind of information
he could give them for one goal.
And that was to reach the ground
alive again.
I just can't see in my mind somebody
throwing somebody out of a helicopter.
I don't believe this kind of stuff
happened. Maybe it did. I don't know.
I never saw it, put it that way.
I've seen G.I.'s get mad and, uh, uh,
rather than shoot one of these dinks,
uh,just punch him right out, yeah,
with his hands.
I don't know where they are.
That's the worst thing.
Right around and run into the sewers
and the gutters, anywhere.
They can be anywhere.Just hopin'
you can stay alive from day to day.
I just want to go back home
and go to school. That's about it.
-
- Quite a few.
We lost one the other day.
The whole thing stinks.
And, like, here come the jets.
Everybody's, ''Yay, jets! Do it to 'em.
Get these motherfuckers off our ass.''
You know.
'Cause they were diggin'
in our behind real good.
And, like, the jet came in
and ''Yay, jet, get 'em.''
And you see 'em swoopin' all around.
''Yay, jet, get 'em.''
And he came over that way
and let it go, and you say, ''Uh-oh.''
And you could see it's napalm cannister,
because you can tell 'em.
They spin asshole over head, backwards
as they're tumbling through the air.
And the thing is just tumbling down.
You know it's coming right at you.
You know. And, like, wow.
The napalm hit, I grabbed this dude,
just put him up over my head
in the hole like that.
Fuckin' napalm went down the whole line.
Just creamed everybody in the line.
Thirty-five dudes, man,just burnt.
Post-toasty to the bitter, you dig?
And that napalm was just drippin' on
both sides of this dude.
He's dead, you know. I'm just
holdin' him up, using him as a shield.
I just chunked this dude off of me
and just sprung out of the hole.
I didn't know which way I was going
outside of back, you dig?
And just ran through.
Burned my pants off.
Spent the rest of the battle running
with no drawers. My stuff hanging out.
You ever try to fight a battle
without any drawers on, man?
Awful sick of it.
I'll be so glad to go home.
I don't know. It's the worst area we've
been in since I've been in Vietnam.
You think it's worth it?
Yeah. I don't know. They say we're
fighting for something. I don't know.
I was at a very kind of
sobering thing last night.
Memorial service for four men
in the second squadron...
who were killed the other day.
One of them being a medic.
And, uh, the place was just packed.
And we sang three hymns
and had a nice prayer.
I turned around, looked at their faces,
and they were--
I was just proud.
My-My, uh, feeling for America...
just soared because of their--
The way they looked.
They looked determined...
and-and-and reverent
at the same time.
But still they're
a bloody good bunch of killers.
in any way,
to worship football.
Nor are we here,
as I'm sure many people believe,
to pray for a victory.
We believe in victory.
We believe it will come to the team
that's best prepared.
There are going to be men made tonight.
And that's religious,
and God cares about that.
We're concerned about the big game.
But we're also concerned
about the bigger game,
the biggest game of all
that surrounds us: the game of life.
May you be winners.
Winners in the big game.
But even more importantly,
winners in the biggest game of all,
which we all play.
Let us pray.
-
-
-
-
- We're number one!
-
-
-
-
- ''Toy hoy''
- Toy hoy?
- Yeah.
Like,  means,
like, wow, you know?
- Look at the hickeys I gave this chick.
-
- Yeah.
-
- Uh, one on each side.
-
-
-
- See, this one? I gave her this one.
-
And this one,
this is the first one right there.
- It came out kind of nasty, you know.
-
- And-- No can do, I know.
- Maybe he's dead.
- He's not dead. Wake him up.
-
Why?
-
- Huh? Why he's no hard?
-
- 'Cause you no wake him up.
This one's, uh, kind of sour on me,
you know? Uh--
-
- Huh?
-
- I'm trying to.
You know what it is about
these chicks down here,
like, they're, uh--
Well, what would you want to do...
except for, you know,
have a ball with them.
- And, uh--Right?
- Right.
You're number one.
Take it off for her.
-
- Here, you don't want this.
-
- I know. I know what you want.
- Hey. Hey, Charles. Charles.
-
Yeah?
It's about time.
It took you long enough,
you know that?
-
-
Check it out later? Mm!
You know, if my chick at home
could see this now, man, she'd flip.
One more.
Yeah, this man here.
Some people enjoy it,
some don't.
Some just go out and do it as a job.
It's a daily grind.
-
- I enjoy it.
Now I know that he will have a very
important message for each one of us,
so I want you all
to listen very attentively...
to what he has to say to you.
-
- If you ever have to go to a war,
and unfortunately, someday
you probably will have to fight a war,
you'll find out
that life becomes very simple.
Because the only thing you're
concerned about is living and dying.
Everything else is unimportant,
because suddenly
your life is at stake.
And that's what it's like to be
when you become a prisoner,
particularly,
a prisoner of war.
How did you feel when
the Vietnam war was over?
How did I feel
when the war was over?
I felt real good.
Real good.
It was a long war
and a very difficult war to understand.
But the reason we went there
was to win this war.
I volunteered to go.
I'd go again if I had to.
And we wanted to win.
That was our number one ambition.
That's what we really wanted,
was to win this war.
And it took us a long time.
So when we knew that we had won,
we felt great;
we really felt great.
- What did Vietnam look like?
-
And they just make a mess
out of everything.
How did you--
How did you, um--
What do you feel about
the people that, um,
went and burned their draft cards
and went into Canada?
We don't agree with them.
I think these people were legally wrong.
I think sometimes they were cowards.
If they wanted to leave
and go to Canada, that's okay.
They're saying that
to you and me.
''I don't like you, so I'm leaving.''
Well, fine, that's okay. There's
no reason to hate a guy for that.
'Cause that's also his right,
but he can't come back.
Instead of helping and aiding
the Vietnamese people,
I saw that we were party to their
deliberate and systematic destruction.
The Vietnamese were considered,
less than humans, inferiors.
We called them ''gooks,'' ''slopes.''
Their lives weren't worth anything to us
because we'd been taught to believe...
that they were all fanatical
and that they were all V.C...
Many of us, however,
began to understand...
through our personal
experiences in Vietnam...
the depth of the lies and deceptions
practiced upon us,
and the American people,
by our country's leaders.
It was they who trained us
to kill without question...
and to hate our enemy--
the Vietnamese.
They concocted such phrases
as ''kill ratios,'' ''search and destroy,''
''free fire zones,''
''secure areas,'' and so on...
to mask the reality
of their combat policy in Vietnam.
But underground life
has become intolerable to me.
So I'm here today to draw attention
to the true facts concerning my case...
and the cases of tens of thousands
just like me.
We are not criminals
to be hunted and imprisoned.
Over a half million of us
have deserted the military since 1 965.
Most of us have already returned
to the military...
to be punished with jail
and bad discharges...
that will be carried around
for the rest of our lives.
And it is a supreme irony
to be prosecuted by the very same men...
who planned and executed
a genocidal war in Indochina.
Now, inside this hearing room,
Eddie Sowders has surrendered himself.
Urged on, he says, by a hand-to-mouth
underground existence...
that still nags at many
of his fellow deserters...
who continue to look
over their shoulders.
Paul Udell,
NBC News, Washington.
- How was your sound?
-
-
You know, Vietnam, uh,
reminded me of a--of a child,
the developing of a child.
The laws of nature control
the development of this child.
A child has to sit up
before it crawls.
It has to crawl
before it walks.
It has to walk before it runs.
I know very little about it
over there, I'll tell ya.
And the less I know,
the better off I'll be.
It has not affected me a whole lot.
I mean, the American--
The way of life is still here.
And if you work for it,
it's there for you.
We're taught that we're
to obey our government,
and I would have to go
if I was instructed to.
Once in a while,
I think about it,
but I like to think about the things
that are happening right now to me.
I don't it's affected mine at all.
I don't even know who we're fighting for
over there, to be real honest with you.
I think we're fighting
for the North Vietnamese, ain't we?
-
-
-
-
I'm a Johnny-come-lately as far
as war profiteering is concerned.
Uh, the reason why I...
uh, organized this group of companies
is because when I was in Paris,
I saw that peace was coming,
whether we liked it or not.
Therefore, I got home
in order to prepare for peace.
All these companies have been organized
in order to prepare for peace...
and prepare for the economic takeoff
that will come with peace.
We have the infrastructure of hotels,
of travel agencies and things like that.
But, of course, there are no tourists
in Vietnam now. But there will be.
And, uh, we are getting
ready for that sort of thing.
-
-
- Stand up.
-
-
-
--
We were walking on a patrol
and, uh, we ran into an ambush.
About six, seven guys
really got hurt.
Ran into a battalion ambush,
they said it was.
And it was supposed to be one
of the biggest ambushes of Tet season.
And we called in two or three medivacs,
and they got hit.
So, finally, the last one
came in and got us out.
From that, I never saw any of the others
I was with, except for one or two.
And that was about it.
Most of the guys I keep in touch with
are guys in the hospital.
They usually have a reunion
once a year.
That's about it. There's really
not that much to talk about.
Here we are for one thing that we said,
and I don't give a shit now.
I don't care
about the football game now.
I don't care about anything now.
The one thing that we wanna show
these bastards with Masillon pride...
is that we come down
and show 'em a great Masillon effort.
And what the piss you doing?
What are ya doing?
Get going!
Goddamn it, Tony!
Don't let 'em beat us!
Don't let 'em beat us!
Let's go!
Show 'em Masillon pride.
Come on! Go!
-  Go!
- Go, go, go, go!
-
Defense, defense
Defense, defense, defense
Make no mistake about it.
I don't want a man in here...
to go back home
thinking otherwise.
We are going to win.
Go, motherfucker! Go!
that after the enemy exposed himself,
we would defeat him.
He would be weakened,
and we could follow that up.
Through the use of, uh,
the maximum military force
that we could bring to bear on him,
through the bombing,
through the mining of the harbors,
through the cutting
of his lines of communication,
by moving in
and cleaning out his sanctuaries,
the enemy would have no choice...
but to come
to some accommodation.
And I started in and asked
the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
None of them knew.
''Uh, do you think that
the 206,000 men will be enough?''
Nobody knew.
''Uh, might we have to send more men?''
''Well, possibly.''
''Well, in six months?''
''We don't know.''
''Ayear? Eighteen months?''
I couldn't get answers
to these questions.
By the end of that
four-day interrogation,
I was getting down--by the end of it--
into very serious questions,
''Do any of you men,
as you look at it objectively,
do you find any diminution
in the will of the enemy to fight?''
Well, they said,
''No, we guess we don't.''
''Are they sending the same number of men
down through the Ho Chi Minh trail?''
''Well, yes, and even
they might be a little more.''
''And how about our bombing? We've placed
great reliance on our bombing.
Is our bombing stopping them?''
''No.''
''Well, what is the amount of attrition
that our bombing's causing?''
''Well, maybe 10 to 15 percent.''
So I remember
asking one question.
''If a North Vietnamese field commander
in South Vietnam needed 1,000 men--''
They said, ''Yes.''
''If he asked for, say, 1,200 men,
''Well, that's right.''
''Then he'd have the thousand he needed.''
''Well, yes. That's so.''
Well, this type of interrogation--
Finally, by the end
of four or five days,
I must say that my thinking...
had undergone
a very substantial revolution.
All we are saying
Is give peace a chance
All we are saying
Is give peace a chance
All we are saying
Is give peace a chance
Power to the people
Stop the war
Power to the people
Stop the war
The enemy was on the ropes
after the Tet offensive was over.
And it's like two boxers
in the ring.
One boxer has the other one
on the ropes,
but the man
who is about to be the victor...
has his second
throw the towel in.
Accordingly,
I shall not seek...
and I will not accept...
the nomination of my party
for another term as your president.
I don't think we helped 'em one bit.
All I think we've done is
destroyed their country, laid it waste.
No. I don't think we helped 'em.
As fellow human beings, I don't think
they should be there doing that.
Certainly a mature person
can say they made a mistake.
Why can't a government?
You let us all go off to war and said,
''Yea, team. Fight in Vietnam,''
and all this kinda shit
in 1 965 through 1 968.
Now 1 968 comes along and ''Boo, team.
Come on home,'' and all this shit.
''And don't say nothin' about it,
'cause we don't want to hear about it...
'cause it's upsetting
around dinnertime.''
Well, Goddamn. It upset me
for a whole goddamn year.
It upset a lot of people to the point
where they're fuckin' dead, you know?
All this shit. You don't wanna
hear about it? I'll tell you every day.
Make you sit out
and puke on your dinner, you dig?
Because you got me over there,
and now you done brought me back here...
and you wanna forget it so somebody else
can go do it somewhere else.
Hell no. Uh-uh.
You gonna hear it all.
Every day as long as you live, because
it's gonna be with me as long as I live.
When I get up in the morning,
when John gets up,
when a lot of dudes sitting here get up,
man, their gut hurts
because they got shot there.
I gotta put on an arm and a leg,
'cause it ain't there no more, you dig?
Now, my man's got a hole in his stomach.
He can't work right, you know?
You do something about that.
Make that all disappear, you dig?
Make it all go away with the 6:00 news.
Turn it off or switch it
to another channel.
Uh-Uh. To hell with that, you dig?
It's here and it's for real.
And it's gonna happen again
unless these folks get off their ass...
and realize it  happened.
The people have judged, I think,
that it's unwise and immoral...
and not in the national interest
of this country...
and that, therefore,
it must be brought to an end.
For 20 years, first the French,
and then the United States...
had been predicting victory in Vietnam.
In 1961 and in 1962,
as well as 1966 and 1967,
we have been told
that the tide is turning,
there is a light
at the end of the tunnel,
we can soon bring our troops home,
victory is near, the enemy is tiring.
Once, in 1962,
I participated
in such a prediction myself.
But for 20 years,
we have been wrong.
The history of conflict
among nations...
does not record another such lengthy
and consistent chronicle of error...
as we have shown in Vietnam.
I had just given the policy line,
stayed up all night with
Adam Walinsky and Peter Edelman,
helping on a speech
for Robert Kennedy...
which proved to be his last speech
given in San Francisco here...
to a businessman's luncheon on Vietnam.
Uh, I went up with some corrections
last thing in the morning...
and shook hands with him
in his bathrobe as he stood there.
And then he came down from
the Ambassador Hotel and got into a car.
We were struck with how easy
it was to get onto that floor...
and approach him at that point.
At the conference
on lessons on Vietnam,
of course, in the morning I learned
that Robert Kennedy had died.
Well--
So--
So, uh--
Well, that was a way
for a lot of people to feel powerless.
So, um,
it began to look as if there was no way
to change this country.
As far as I'm concerned today,
I have no hesitancy
whatsoever...
in saying I could not
have been more wrong...
in my attitude toward Vietnam.
...ground combat,
Vietnamese cross of gallantry
with a silver star,
gallantry in ground combat,
four air medals,
an ''I was there'' ribbon.
I got a colonel that's flying upstairs,
and he's gettin' down on me...
and he's saying, ''Take the hill,
take the hill, take the hill.''
So I got together
with the tank commander...
and I said,
''Look, let's take three tanks...
and we'll walk the A.R.V.N.
up the hill, you know?
And we'll lay down a base of fire
as we're going.''
He says, ''Okay.'' I got with the A.R.V.N.
and says, ''Let's fly.''
So I popped up
behind the lead tank...
and, uh, started to go up the hill.
And everything was cool,
until we started taking fire.
And, uh, the A.R.V.N. started to split.
And that's when I got it.
I said, ''Oh, my God. I'm hit.''
I couldn't believe it, you know?
''I can't believe it. I'm really hit.''
And my first, first thought...
was Kay, my girl, you know?
It's gonna sound stupid,
but I'm--but my thought was
''She'll kill me.''
You know, here I was dying and I was
worried that she was gonna kill me.
--
On this shitty piece of ground,
I'm dying...
and I can't fuckin' believe it.''
Bobby was a surfer,
he was a wrestler,
he was a long-distance runner.
We danced. He was active.
Active, active.
--
--
Right, wrong or indifferent,
that's how I feel.
When I was in the Marine Corps,
I remember I was in the Marine Corps
barracks in Washington--
They call it
''A,'' ''F,'' and ''I.''
And they had
the Marine Corps drill team there.
And I was standing at attention
in my uniform...
and they were playing
the ''Marine Corps Hymn''.
And then they played
the ''Star-Spangled Banner.''
And I actually started to cry.
I cried because I was so proud
to be an American, you know?
And I was so proud
to be a marine...
and in uniform,
standing there at attention.
That-That represented
so much to me...
in the way of life and--
That's gone, you know?
And that hurt.
That
That's what I'm bitter about.
Ha! Didn't think we were here,
did you, you dirty rotten rats!
We're still here!
We'll always be here!
Truman lied from 1 950 on...
on the nature and purposes
of the French involvement,
the colonial reconquest of Vietnam...
that we were financing
and encouraging.
Eisenhower lied
about the reasons for...
and the nature
of our involvement with Diem,
and the fact that he was in power,
essentially,
because of American support,
American money, and for no other reason.
Kennedy lied about the type
of involvement we were doing there,
our own combat involvement,
and about the recommendations that were
made to him for greater involvement.
President Kennedy lied about...
the degree of our participation
in the overthrow of Diem.
The, um,--Johnson, of course,
lied and lied and lied...
about our provocations
against the North Vietnamese...
prior to and after
the Tonkin Gulf incidents,
about the plans
for bombing North Vietnam,
and the nature of the buildup...
of American troops in Vietnam.
Nixon, as we now know,
misled and lied
to the American public...
for the first months of his office
in terms of our bombing of Cambodia...
and of Laos,
ground operations in Laos,
the reasons for our invasion
of Cambodia and of Laos,
and the prospects for the mining
at Haiphong that came about in 1 972,
but was envisioned
as early as 1969.
The American public
was lied to month by month...
by each of these
five administrations.
As I say, it's a tribute
to the American public,
that their leaders perceived
that they had to be lied to.
It's no tribute to us
that it was so easy to fool the public.
We have adopted a plan...
which we have worked out in cooperation
with the South Vietnamese...
for the complete withdrawal
of all U.S. combat ground forces...
and their replacement
by South Vietnamese forces...
on an orderly,
scheduled timetable.
This withdrawal will be made
from strength and not from weakness.
As South Vietnamese forces
become stronger,
the rate of American withdrawal
can become greater.
-
-
Oh, my friend.
- How you doing? Good to see you again.
- You just get back?
- Yeah. How you doing, men?
- Very good to see you.
How you doing?
Trung, good seeing you.
-
- How you doing? Fine.
Just came in this afternoon, sir.
Been very quiet?
- Except last time, when the, uh--
- When the rockets went off?
-
- Yeah.
Very nice.
I read about it in
That's one of our success stories here,
this battalion is.
We had a real, uh--
a lot of trouble with it.
We just gave, uh,
four bronze stars...
and five Ar-Comms
with V-device this week...
to a battalion commander and
three of his officers and five soldiers.
And we have six N-pac awards...
pending for
last Saturday night's action...
where we killed six V.C.
and captured nine weapons.
Good grief.
And then they moved him over here.
In a ten-day period or two-week period,
he completely reversed it.
They had the battalion here
under a very poor major.
They had it to the point
where the company commanders...
were throwing down their weapons
and crying--or at least one of them did.
Ten days later they had
a big contact with the V.C...
and in 3 days killed 42,
lost none of their own.
Although some of his people,
like that young major there, Major Yuk--
tremendous guy.
He just heard his name over there.
Hey.
is that the Vietnamese
communist leadership...
find enough people
to live in the tunnels,
fight for nothing
wearing ragged shorts,
year after year
under the American bombs.
were the foreigners we financed
in the first part of the war...
and the foreigners we
in the second half of the war.
Basically,
we didn't want to acknowledge...
the scale of our involvement there.
We didn't want to realize
that it was our war,
The question used to be ''Might it
be possible we were on the wrong side...
in the Vietnamese War?''
We weren't on the wrong side.
We  the wrong side.
You have exemplified,
in your corner of the world,
patriotism of the highest order.
--
Every morning, ''Yes, sir.''
On the Vietnamese side,
I would say the most
encouraging factor...
is the promise offered
by General Khanh's government.
-
-
- General Taylor.
- Uh, this is General Khanh speaking.
How are you?
Glad to hear you.
Uh, uh, may I speak in French?
Mr. President
and ladies and gentlemen,
as our joint communique indicates,
President Thieu and I have
had very constructive talks...
with regard to how we shall
work together in the years ahead,
working for the program of peace,
Just because you want us
to have freedom?
What kind of freedom
could you give us?
We know that we only have freedom
if we fight for it.
But here we fight for what?
We fight for prisons?
I was at home
when the security police came.
In a country where the people
don't hold national sovereignty,
in a country where
the government has proven itself...
to be the enemy of the people,
the prisoners are the patriots.
And no matter
how badly treated we are,
still we are proud,
because at least we are free,
instead of enslaved as so many
of the so-called government officials.
In this case, it's the house.
And you start to learn
to respect authority.
And so, finally, lo and behold,
at 20, 22 years old,
you find yourself in service
and maybe take that last and final step,
where you become
quite regimented...
in a military form of discipline.
That stuff isn't worth the paper it's
written on, if the basis isn't there.
You need that cornerstone that goes back
to childhood, and who's teaching you,
it's gonna be pretty darn miserable.
No doubt about it.
You're scared. You're really petrified.
But at the other side,
you have a bunch of women back there...
telling you, ''You better do something,''
you know?
That's the wrath of God. You don't
want 1 00 women climbing down your back,
-
- So you figure the gooks aren't so bad.
then you should be
proud of yourselves,
because I was
what you made me to be.
As for my own view,
uh, I thought through
as best I could...
the meaning of Southeast Asia
to the United States in the 1 950s,
looking backward
and looking forward...
in terms of what I know about
the dynamics of societies and so on.
And on balance--
It is an on-balance judgment--
I came to the judgment that it's
a vital interest to the United States.
I've never had any reason
to change that judgment.
And, uh, therefore, I, uh,
I do believe that what we have done
is generally right,
although I would have preferred
to have seen a different,
more decisive military strategy.
Certainly, to me,
the day you can say that a sacrifice
such as that is not worthwhile...
is the day that you've destroyed
all your real values...
of what is worthwhile
and what isn't.
And there's no question in my mind...
that he and everybody else
that did what he did--
there's no sacrifice that is in vain.
Absolutely none. Down the line,
that's the price you pay for freedom...
and that's the price that you pay
for the kind of stature that we have...
and it's the kind of risk you take...
to preserve the ideals that we have.
He had just a tremendous
sense of humor...
and just an amazing, instinctive sense
of what was important and what wasn't.
I remember when I was getting ready
for our oldest daughter's wedding,
and I was upset because
something or other wasn't going well,
and he called up from Pensacola
and he said, ''How are thing's going?''
And I said, ''Fine, Bing,
but such-and-such has happened.''
He said, ''Oh, Mom,
don't sweat the small stuff.''
You know,
it just made all the difference.
I thought, ''Gee. That really
is small stuff, you know?''
And it was. Yeah.
And it made the whole thing
much easier.
--
In World War II, there was no question
everybody was part of it.
There was not the kind
of dissension and so forth...
that there has been surrounding
the Vietnam thing.
are too busy
to get involved deeply...
and I think it's a terrific system,
is that you do rely on somebody
like President Nixon for leadership.
I think his team of people with him
are outstanding...
and, to me,
the leadership that he has shown...
and decisions
that he has made,
uh, really have--
They're the kind of decisions...
I would expect from
the president of this country.
And the action he has taken
is the action I'd expect...
from the president of this country.
I think the whole executive,
legislative and judicial system
that we have is superb.
It has worked many, many-- far better
than any other system I'm aware of...
and brought us
to our state of power...
and, uh, really,
of international stature...
that we have a responsibility
to stay with and to uphold.
He actually had just got a job
with
when he went
into the, uh, O.C.S.
And he'd worked for newspapers
in the summer...
while he was at college.
You don't remember pain too well...
afterwards.
It is always the custom
at a dinner at the White House...
to have a toast
to the honored guest.
The difficulty tonight is that
there are so many honored guests...
that we would be drinking
all night and into the day.
Somebody just said,
''What's wrong with that?''
was on December the 1 8th of last year.
-
- There--
and after having talked to them,
I think that all of us...
would like to join
in a round of applause...
for the brave men that
took those B-52s in and did the job.
Here they died.
-
-
Well, the Oriental...
doesn't put the same high price on life
as does a Westerner.
Life is plentiful,
life is cheap in the Orient.
And, uh, as the, uh,
philosophy of the, uh,
of the Orient, uh,
uh, expresses it, uh,
uh, life is, uh,
is not important.
the result of what I was doing...
the result of this-this game,
this, uh, exercise
of my technical expertise...
never really dawned on me.
That reality of the screams
or the people being blown away...
or their homeland being destroyed,
uh,just was not a part
of what I thought about.
-
-
Uh, we, as Americans,
have never experienced that.
We've never experienced
any kind of devastation.
I didn't drop napalm,
but I dropped other things just as bad.
I dropped C.B.U.s,
which can't destroy anything.
It's meant for people.
It's an antipersonnel weapon.
We used to drop canister upon canister
of these things...
with 200 tumbling little balls in there
about this big around...
with something like
that would blow out
as soon as it hit the ground,
uh, and shred people to pieces.
They couldn't be gotten out
in many cases.
People would suffer. They would live,
but they would suffer, you know?
Then often they would die afterwards.
This would cause people
to have to take care of them, you know?
But I look at my children now...
and, uh,
I don't know
what would happen if, uh--
uh, what I would think about
if someone napalmed them.
I think we're trying not to.
I think I'm trying not to sometimes.
I can't even cry easily.
From my, uh,
my manhood image.
I think Americans have tried--
We've all tried very hard...
to escape
what we've learned in Vietnam,
to not come to the logical conclusions
of what's happened there.
You know, the military
does the same thing.
They don't realize that, um,
people fighting
for their own freedom...
uh, are not gonna be stopped...
by just changing your tactics,
adding a little bit more
sophisticated technology over here,
improving the tactics
we used last time,
not making
quite the same mistakes.
Uh, you know, I think history operates
a little different than that.
And I think that those kind of forces
are not gonna be stopped.
I think Americans
have worked extremely hard...
not to see, uh, the criminality,
uh, that their officials
and their policy makers,
uh, have exhibited.

Vets need jobs, not parades

Vets need jobs, not parades
It's your country, not a toilet,
you bastards!
They oughta go to Cuba.
That's where they belong. Or Russia.
U.S.A. all the way
Vets need jobs not parades
- Boo!
-
Man, let me talk to somebody.
I was in Vietnam.
I was a platoon leader over there.
What is this?
What the hell is this?
were the ones that got shot.
You guys were over there too
with your damn cameras.
Come on, smile a little bit!
Come on! Smile! Smile!
Be happy! Smile!
Everything isn't bad!
Smile, people! Smile!
