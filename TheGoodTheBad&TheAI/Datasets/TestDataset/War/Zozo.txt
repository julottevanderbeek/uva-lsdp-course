Mom?
Mom? Look what I made.
- That's nice.
- Look, please.
Not now. Wait a minute.
Mom,
when are we going to Sweden?
What's wrong with you?
"Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!"
Cut it out, we're watching the news.
- What's the matter?
- Look what I made.
- It's very nice. Did you carve it?
- Yes.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- Tell me, Zozo.
- It's nothing.
- Do you ever dream, Mom?
- Yes. Have you been dreaming?
Did you dream a lot
when you were a child?
Tell me
what you've been dreaming?
You're not going to leave me,
are you?
Darling, what makes you think that?
How can you think I'd leave you?
I'd leave the whole world
before I left you, sweetie.
Don't ever think like that again.
- Have you finished your homework?
- No, not yet.
Come here! Give me a kiss.
I'll tell you something.
Look at this ruler.
If it's one mm shorter than 15cm,
you'll never see the money.
- Well?
- Wait, I'm thinking of a beautiful girl.
- Imagine Amil's sister.
- What?!
I'm kidding.
But... your sister is amazing.
As amazing as your head.
Shut up, will you!
My God! My granddad doesn't even
have a thing like that!
- It must be fake.
- Hurry up if you want to measure it.
Amil! Riad! I've been
looking for you everywhere.
- Where's my money?
- Shut up. Never mind him.
Come on, let's go!
- His sister is pretty, isn't she?
- Yeah, but don't exaggerate.
I'm not. It's not like
I'm gonna do something to her.
Forget her. Just forget her!
Guys... Who wants bread?
But it's not my turn.
- I went last time.
- No, I did, then him and now you.
On one condition...
I get to meet your sister.
- Stop talking about my sister!
- I just want to say hello to her.
- OK, but that's the last time.
- Think about the bread instead.
Shit, he's really horny.
- Three breads, please.
- Certainly.
OK. One, two, go!
- My money!
- Hold the bread.
You brats, you bastards!
Where did he go? Did you see him?
- Son, I have no idea.
- Bastards!
Charbel, my son. Warde, my daughter-
in-law. I hope you're all well.
And most importantly, Zozo?
Zozo, my love. You're well, I hope.
Hurry up with the paperwork
so you can come to Sweden soon.
We're waiting, grandma and I.
I'll teach you some Swedish-
- so you're prepared
when you arrive. I'll start now.
"What's your name"
is "what's your name".
"How you are" means "how are you".
"Where comes from school" means
"when did you come from school".
"Table dining" means "dining table".
"Curtanny" means "curtains".
"Flowers" means "flower".
They like flowers a lot over here.
"Go play soccer, Zozo"
means "Go and play soccer, Zozo".
I know you love soccer, Zozo.
Please hurry and come over
so that we can meet soon.
Take care now, my dear Zozo.
"Bye" means "bye".
"Bye."
- How's the paperwork going?
- The passports are ready...
...and the tickets
are coming any day now.
- Flowers...
- What's that?
- Grandpa just said it.
- It means "flower".
"Flower"? Does that mean
that my name is Flowers in Swedish?
Lmagine me introducing you: "I'm
Charbel and this is my wife Flowers."
No thanks, I'm not hungry.
- Have a bite.
- No, I'm going downstairs.
- Where to? Eat first.
- I'm studying with a girlfriend.
You're too thin.
Eat first and study later.
You're the one
who's always telling me to study.
- Okay. Give my love to her Mom.
- I will.
Take care now, my son.
"Give my love to her Mom"? You did
anything to catch a glimpse of me.
I did? You were always
showing off behind the curtains.
- We didn't have any curtains.
- I meant "curtanny", like Grandpa said.
Okay, but we did have a rug
that I used to beat on the balcony.
They won't even let you eat in peace...
Dani, get downstairs!
Hurry, hurry! Give me the passports.
Hurry up!
Wait for me downstairs by the door.
There are so many
destroyed buildings in Lebanon.
It's not like that in Sweden.
They've only got nice houses there.
- How do you know?
- My grandmother sends me pictures.
- The sea, trees... It's like paradise.
- What are the girls like there?
- Tall and blonde. You'd like them.
- Send me one then, will you?
- Stop talking about girls.
- I'm not talking to you.
You're wet behind the ears
and you want to talk about girls!
- It's not your business.
- Who wants to date you?
Just a thought: We're going to Sweden
soon. Will you come with us?
- Where's Sweden? Never heard of it.
- It's a nice country far away.
- There's no war there.
- Are there countries without war?
- There's no war there.
- How'd you know?
I know because grandma's
sent me pictures.
- Here, have a look.
- Let me see. It looks nice.
Yeah, it's really nice. If we go there
we can have fun all the time.
- What?
- We'll have fun.
But how can I go with you?
I don't have a passport.
- I'll hide you, but my dad musn't see.
- What if your dad sees me?
Don't worry, I'll arrange something.
- Who are you talking to?
- No one.
- Yes, you're talking to someone.
- No, I'm not.
Are you talking to a chicken?
Have you lost your mind?
No, I'm bringing him to Sweden.
Sure, just get him a passport,
a visa and a ticket too.
- No, seriously.
- Seriously, come up and eat instead.
- Guess where we're going today.
- To Sweden? Is it true?!
- I'm going to Sweden today!
- You're so lucky.
I'm going to miss you!
- I'll miss you too.
- Say hello to Riad, I won't have time.
- Tell him to leave your sis alone.
- He messes with her, I'll kick his ass.
- Before you go: Don't forget to write.
- I'll do my best.
- Just send anything.
- I will. Bye.
- Maybe I'll come after you.
- Please try.
- Where's your passport?
- I gave it to you.
- I can't find it.
- What do you mean you can't find it?
- Mom, where's my pink skirt?
- Forget about it.
- But I want to bring it with me.
- Bring something else. Just hurry up.
- You put it in the kitchen?
- In the kitchen?
Are you going to make soup of it?
Darling, I can't find your passport.
What do you mean?
I put it here with yours...
Here it is.
- Yes, Dad?
- Hurry home now. Hurry!
- I have to talk to my girlfriend.
- Forget about her. We're leaving!
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
Go and buy some water. Hurry!
- You said I was going with you.
- Yes, but on the next flight.
Why?
I thought we were going together.
- The plane was full.
- Why didn't you tell me?
I just found out.
I'll send you a ticket tomorrow.
- How will you send it?
- I'll arrange it.
- Have you been lying?
- No I'm not lying.
You said we'd get married
and have children.
- Yes, and we will.
- Why've you been lying!
You are my sweetheart,
I'd never lie to you.
- Mom!
- Don't look at them.
- Look at me!
- Mom!
- What are you doing?
- Climb inside. Hurry!
- Take these.
- Dani, come with me!
Listen! I can't, but don't be afraid.
I promise I'll come back for you.
The soldiers will be here
any second. Keep quiet!
- Get up now.
- Is that you, Mom?
Come here, Zozo.
- Where am I?
- You're with me.
- Where are you?
- Here.
- What is this?
- Don't be afraid.
Zozo? Come on, wake up now.
I don't think your brother will return.
I know it's hard,
but you must be strong.
Maybe he'll show up at the airport?
Come on, let's go to Sweden.
- Hello.
- Hello, what would you like?
One bread, please.
- Here. That'll be five lira.
- But I have no money.
No money? Do you think this
is charity? Give it back and go away!
- What's this supposed to mean?
- Why not give it to him, you bastard?
- Can't you see he's hungry?
- Aren't you the landlord's daughter?
- How are you? How's your dad?
- Fine. Why didn't you give it to him?
- I tried to, but he refused it.
- Don't lie. I heard you.
- Here you are. Enjoy.
- Here's some money to keep you happy.
- Would you like something else?
- It's on me.
- No, don't bother.
- Get off my back then.
We might as well close
if everyone gets to eat for free.
You look like you're starving.
Thanks for this.
Is that your chicken? It's cute.
What's its name?
- I don't know.
- Why are you so sad?
- Do you know the way to the airport?
- Why do you want to go there?
- I'm going to Sweden.
- To Sweden? By yourself?
- Yes.
- Where are your parents?
They're dead.
If you want to get to the airport
it's near my house. I'll take you.
- What's your name?
- Zozo.
My name is Rita.
- Is the airport far away?
- No, we're pretty close.
But it's getting dark. I don't think
any planes fly this late.
- Are we by the airport?
- I want to show you something first.
- What's that?
- Cartridges.
- It's beautiful here, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.
Dad takes me here when they go bird
hunting. I'll show you how they do it.
They hide behind a tree,
load their guns and take aim...
And then, if they see a bird...
Come here, quickly!
I'll count to three,
and then we start shooting birds.
One, two... come on!
Quiet...
Hurry up. In here!
Just hurry up and be careful.
Stay there and be as quiet as you can.
Where have you been?
You stupid little girl?
Don't you know what time it is?
Go straight to bed now!
Next time you're home this late
I'll kill you, you little brat!
You can come out now.
Can I sit down?
- Did he hit you?
- No.
- But you're all red.
- He's always that angry.
It's okay. I'll get a mattress for you.
Don't worry about it.
I can sleep on the floor.
- Zozo, are you asleep?
- No.
Can I hold your hand?
One, two... come on!
Come on, shoot.
How are you feeling?
- Fine, but I feel something strange.
- Me too. What is it?
I don't know.
Do you?
- What are you doing?
- Going with you to Sweden.
- Really?
- Hurry up so we don't miss the plane.
Hurry!
- Wait.
- What is it?
I have to talk to my sister.
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to miss you very much.
I'm going to the airport
with my boyfriend.
- Where?
- The airport.
To the airport? With him?
Kids today... Get upstairs now.
No, we'll miss the plane.
Don't tell dad.
- What? Get upstairs now.
- Don't tell him.
Get in here or he's going to kill you!
- I can't. Bye.
- Rita, come back!
- Hurry up, we'll miss the plane!
- Wait, I'll be right there.
- Are you sure you don't want to come?
- Yes, don't worry.
Why should I go there? It's too cold.
At least it's warm here.
I'm a chicken, I need warmth.
- I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you too.
- But that's life. What can you do?
- What will you do? Where will you go?
I'll be alright.
I'll just hang out with my buddies.
We'll have fun, chill, catch some rays,
drink some beer. I'll be alright.
Alright, you take care.
Turn the engine off and open
the window. Where are you going?
- To the airport.
- You too? Where are you going?
- To Sweden.
- Bullshit. Both of you, out of the car!
To Sweden? You serious?
Do you have the necessary papers?
Get them. Little kids
going to Sweden... What a joke!
Let me have them
and wait here with her.
- But I don't have a passport.
- Maybe my sister's will do?
What if they find out?
- Come, quick.
- What is it?
- What is it?
- It's my dad.
How did he get here?
What do we do now?
Have you seen a little girl?
She's about this tall.
- Yes, we just stopped a girl and a boy.
- Where are they now?
Wait, I'll have a look.
- Guys! Where are the kids?
- They were just here.
- So where are they?
Zozo, I like you so much.
But... I have to go now.
What!
Come here, you little brat!
Where have you been? I'll teach you
not to run away like that!
What have you been doing? Tell me!
- Leave her alone!
- You little bastard! Who are you?
Do you think
you can take my little girl?!
Let go of me! I'm going to kill him!
Rita, come with me. Rita!
- What's your name?
- Zozo.
What was going on out there, Zozo?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean "I don't know"?
And the man who was shouting?
- I don't know.
- Are you here all alone?
Yes.
All these identification documents
and tickets... who do they belong to?
- My family.
- Where is your family?
Dead.
- Are all of them dead?
- Yes.
- Can you help me get to Sweden?
- Who do you know in Sweden?
My grandfather and grandmother.
Okay, I'll see what I can do.
Hello, this is Tony.
Can I ask you a favour?
Grandpa! Grandma!
Sweetheart! Welcome.
I'm so glad you're safe!
I've missed you, Zozo!
It's so good to hug you. You're
the most precious thing in our lives.
- What shall we do with Zozo?
- What do you mean, my love?
- Should we talk about his family?
- Does it matter if we talk or not?
What's happened has happened.
He's a child. Why remind ourselves?
Let him live like other kids,
in peace and quiet.
You're right.
I won't dress in black then.
No, it's best you don't.
It was God's will. What can we do?
- Talk quieter so he won't hear us.
- Okay.
Go back to sleep now, my darling.
Let's go to the lake.
It's a very nice lake.
Come on now, Zozo!
Well done. Well done, my boy!
Well done! Attaboy, Zozo!
You're granddad's little hero!
- Let's break it so it's easier to chew.
- Can I share it with you?
Add a little bit of salt
and we'll have a really tasty apple.
- You can remove your teeth?
- It helps me taste better.
I can remove them
and put them wherever I want.
- Doesn't it hurt?
- No, nothing hurts your granddad.
- I'm as tough as nails.
- Where are your real teeth?
Do you want to hear that story?
It's a long and winding one.
- Which tooth do I begin with?
- They each have a story?
- Yes, they all have a story. Pick one.
- That one.
Did you have to pick that one?
Your granddad got into some rough
fights when he was young.
I'd smash people to pieces. I would
crush anything that got in my way.
This tooth... Your grandmother and I
were going to the cinema -
- when some bastard came and bumped
her on the shoulder. Right here.
I have a brain, by God, but that
bastard made me shut it down.
- So you attacked?
- Yes, I did. Bravo, Zozo!
I closed in on him:
"You son of a whore! You fuck!"
I used my left fist
and went... bam! Right in the face.
Then my left fist... bam!
Crushing his nose...
- Shall I take that one?
- Yes, just go ahead and take it.
- Shit, you're heavier than me now!
- What the hell are you doing?!
- He scared me.
- What a monster.
- I have a few in my pocket.
- What a cheap bastard. Bloody idiot!
Take it easy.
Look how he's eating! The shame! It
looks like he hasn't eaten in a month.
For God's sake, leave me alone.
I've eaten like this for 30 years
and now it's a problem?
Leave me alone. Go find someone else
if I'm not good enough anymore.
That man Lambare,
he likes talking to me.
My darling. Lambare, I don't care
about Lambare or his father Ambare.
At least he doesn't have a gut
and even has hair on his head.
This is true.
No gut and hair on his head.
But one leg is wooden, the other one
plastic. You can have him.
What are you waiting for? Tell her
how the girls hound us on the street.
- How they keep fondling us.
- Congratulations.
I hope you live a thousand years.
Believe me, you are my everything.
I hope God doesn't
take you away from me.
- You know I'm kidding too.
- We have to lighten things up for Zozo.
He's the apple of his grandfather's
eye. We just want to make you laugh.
Really? Well,
I think we have something here...
- Yes, a shoe.
- Shoes? Shoes...
Can I haggle over the price?
- Haggle? Like sheep's guts?
- Haggle. Shoes.
- Your Swedish is coming along so well.
- I'm learning.
Bravo.
Tell me what words you've learnt.
Shoes, haggle, orange, apple, car...
You speak better Swedish than your
granny. You're smart, like grandpa.
You speak better Swedish than me?
I speak better Swedish than the
Swedes. What are you talking about?
- Go ahead, then.
- I'll go ahead alright.
Where are ayou from?
I can aspeak a lot of Sweden.
I can adance, I can asing,
I can aplay the sexyphone.
I... can speak... a little Swedish.
I can speak a little Swedish.
Orange...
Orange, apple...
...car, haggle, shoes...
...bear... I'm leaving.
You're leaving.
I am dumb.
Hi, my name is Zozo
and I'm eleven years old.
I can speak a little Swedish
and Arabic.
I live with my grandmother
and grandfather.
I'm from Lebanon
and I like to play soccer.
And I also like apples with salt.
- Salt?
- Yes, it's nice.
It's a little...
- Sour?
- Sour.
- I like pears with salt. Don't you?
- Yeah. I need to try bananas with salt.
- How about bananas with pepper?
- Be quiet.
Zozo? You can sit over there.
- Hey.
- Hi.
My name's Kalle.
Don't call me Karl, it's a stupid name.
- Hi, Karl.
- No, Kalle.
- Your name is Karl.
- No, it's Kalle. One more thing.
- I hate girls too.
- No, you don't.
- You asked Jenny to go steady.
- No, she asked me.
- Be quiet!
- It's them. They're teasing me.
They're saying I go steady
with Jenny, but I hate her.
Remember you have sports
after the break.
Give me the ball.
Give it here. Give me the ball, dammit.
Hi.
- What a big book.
- I've read bigger.
How can you read everything...
so much?
It's not that hard.
I can't do it.
I read too. I read Bamse.
With Bamse and Little Skutt.
That's not a book, that's a comic.
I know. I read it. It's good.
- Do you want to play soccer?
- I don't know. I'm not very good.
We can play anyway.
- I've got to go.
- Okay. I'll see you.
- Hey there. Who are you?
- My name is Zozo.
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Lebanon.
Lebanon? Where's that?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
- Do you play soccer?
- Yes, I'm good at soccer.
Sorry.
- That was good?
- Not especially.
- Why did he leave?
- It doesn't matter.
- Why does it matter if he leaves?
- I don't understand.
What do you mean? We're the ones
who make the rules here.
- Why?
- You have problem with that?
- What?
- Stop it!
Cut it out. Are you stupid?!
Stop!
Stop it, dammit!
- Hello, sunshine.
- Hello, gorgeous.
What a beauty.
Is that your face or is it the sun?
God give me strength.
Are you sewing my shirt?
Zozo fell off his bike
so I'm sewing the button that fell off.
- Zozo!
- Yes, grandpa.
- What happened to your face?
- Nothing, I fell off my bike.
No, you've been in a fight.
- No, it's true.
- Come on, we're friends. What is it?
- It's the truth.
- Zozo?
- I was in a fight.
- With who?
- These three guys.
- What? Three boys hit you?
- Yes, they were older than me.
- Who are these fags?!
Damn hooligans.
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, I can't drink any more.
Coffee is...
Do you understand? Good.
Hello, Jocke. Have a seat right there.
Is that the boy that hit you?
- Why did you hit my grandson?
- I didn't hit him.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I didn't hit anyone.
Hold on!
- Don't you understand?
- Yes, but I didn't hit him.
- You want to wrestle with Zozo?
- Please, this is no way to resolve this.
Sit down and be quiet!
Don't you understand?
You can't be three boys against one.
Get up. - Come up here
and beat the shit out of him.
One, two, three!
- Stop this.
- Get out of here!
- You want to wrestle with me? Wait.
- I don't want anyone to fight.
We need to be calm and reasonable.
I don't want to fight!
Hold on. Take it easy.
Bloody stupid headmaster.
He's ruined my day.
What kind of headmaster is he?
How do the students stand him?
Zozo, listen to me. Promise me
never to be afraid of anyone.
Anyone comes up to you, just hit him.
Rearrange his face.
Don't be afraid, no matter who it is.
Understand?
Okay?
Hey, hold on!
Let me make myself clear, if you ever
rat on me again you're dead!
- I don't understand.
- What don't you understand?
- I won't squeal.
- And don't squeal to your grandpa.
Come to me instead. Be a man.
What's this? Math?
He studies math. Don't study math,
study Swedish, fucking foreigner!
Hello.
What is your name?
My name is Zozo.
Do you speak Arabic?
Who are you?
What do you want from me?
Are you God?
Can you bring my family back to life?
Can you bring my Mom back to life?
This is my Mom.
Can you bring her back to life?
Why won't you answer me?
Answer me!
Come on, answer me.
- What's with you? What're you doing?
- Nothing.
What do you mean "nothing"?
Why do you look so sad?
- Been fighting again?
- No.
Yes, you have. Look at me.
Who hit you?
No one.
What did I tell you?
You don't take crap from anyone.
If anyone messes with you
you just swing at him right away.
Grandpa, I can't.
- Why not?
- I just can't.
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm not like you.
You should be better and stronger
than me. Don't say that again!
- Then I'll just have to be a coward.
- No, you won't. Come back!
- Leave me alone.
- Don't be so hard on him.
Should he get beat up every day?
- Calm down.
- I won't be calm! Come back here.
"Hi, Rita. How are you?"
"I'm writing to you from Sweden to
tell you everything is great here."
"The other day I dreamt we were in
a house, playing and having fun."
"I hope the dream comes true."
"I've missed you so much.
Can't you come to Sweden?"
- Nice eraser.
- Thanks.
- Where did you get it?
- From the store.
- Do you want it?
- You're giving it to me? Thanks.
- Look what Zozo gave me.
- Cool. Can I have one too?
I don't have any more.
You can have this. It smells good.
Thanks.
- Can I have a pen too?
- Sure you can.
- Then can I have an eraser too?
- An eraser and a pen? Sure.
Thanks.
- I want these.
- That'll be six crowns.
- And his head goes flying off...
- Hi.
- I got you an eraser and a pen.
- That's so nice of you. Thanks.
- Were there any other colours?
- Yes... No... What...?
- Were there other colours?
- Where did you get that pen?
- Would you like one? I can get it.
- Can I have one too?
Can I have an eraser?
- My sister needs an eraser.
- My mom needs one too.
"Hi, Zozo. Grandpa and I are at
the hospital, but don't worry."
"Hopefully, we'll be home tonight.
There's food in the fridge."
"Take care."
- What's wrong with you, grandpa?
- Why are you here? School's over?
- Yes. What's wrong with you?
- Nothing. I fell off my bicycle.
I broke both my legs.
Don't worry about it.
- You broke your legs?
- Yes, they got a bit broken.
- Why is gran crying?
- That's just how she is.
Could you leave so that
I can speak to Zozo alone?
I want to tell you something.
- Have you ever seen me cry?
- No.
Have you seen anything
that shows me as being weak?
It is true... my son has died.
I've grieved, but it was his fate.
Everyone has to walk that path.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Okay, so my legs are broken.
But if all of me is broken I'll still
make it, with God's help.
I fear nothing. I have a heart of iron
and a will of steel.
I want you to be like me.
Grandpa, I've tried to be like you,
but I can't.
Maybe next week, next month, it'll
happen. Never fear. Stay strong.
Okay. Give me a kiss.
May God give you a long life.
Excuse me for being late.
What is this?
I don't know.
