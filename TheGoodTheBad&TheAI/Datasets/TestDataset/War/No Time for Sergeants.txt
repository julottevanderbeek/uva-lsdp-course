Will?
WILL:
What is it, Pa?
Come out here.
Listen. Your ears are better than mine.
Somebody's coming.
I don't hear nothing.
Turn off that whatchama-call-it.
- The radio.
- I know what you call it. Turn it off.
First, I heard one of them cars.
Then it stopped.
And now
somebody's coming down the hill.
You hear?
MAN: Y'all stay right here.
If I call, come a-running.
Pa, that ain't no way to welcome folks.
Maybe it's kin.
Kin don't come in no cars.
See if you can wake up
that old hound dog.
Hey, Blue?
Come on, Blue.
I got a big old catfish head for you.
Come on, Blue.
Never seen such a crickety dang pit
in my whole life.
Stuck up all over here and everything.
- Are you Will Stockdale?
- Howdy.
Three dang times this month,
I've been out here...
Don't you point your finger
in my boy's face.
Are you threatening me with a firearm?
I'm a government representative
on business.
Busting up here
without saying howdy or nothing.
- What government?
- U.S. government. The draft board.
This boy's been called for the draft.
He never reported.
He's a draft dodger.
Fold in that finger, sir.
I'm warning you, fold in that finger.
He could go to jail for that.
He's in today's group.
And this is your last chance.
If you don't leave with that group
at 12 a. m...
...you're gonna be in more trouble
than you ever did see.
You already got one offense against you.
- Not answering my letters.
- I never got no letters.
Don't tell me you can't read. You could've
got somebody to read them to you.
- So that ain't no excuse.
- You mean to stand there...
...and tell me to my face
my boy can't read?
- Now, look...
- You think my boy...
...who has gone to school...
...and who has read more times
than you could shake a stick at...
...couldn't read a puny little old letter,
if he wanted to?
By dog, sir.
I never got no letters.
I don't think I can stand
to listen to any more of this.
Get that book.
No, sir, what you think
don't mean nothing to me...
...but we are gonna settle this here question
right here and now...
...and not have
no more foolishness about it.
Read at him.
"Once there was a boy named Tony...
...who wanted a pony.
So he went to his mama and said:
'May I have a pony? '
And his Mama says:
'No, Tony, you may not have a pony."'
Go on.
"So he went to his papa and said:
'Papa, may I have a pony? '
And his papa says:
'No, Tony, you may not have...
...a pony."'
End of the book,
he gets the pony anyhow.
Now that we have settled
if or not my boy can read...
- Pa.
- you best be getting off my property...
...and back in that car of yours
and out of range...
- Pa, be Christian to him.
- Christian?
You know
what the Lord would've done...
...if a man come all hot
and stomping onto his property...
...without saying howdy or nothing?
Scaring his chickens
and saying folks can't read?
Sir, would it be all right
if me and Pa speak private-like?
- Okay, but make it short.
- Thank you, sir.
Come on, Pa.
And don't try any funny business.
Because I ain't alone here.
Set yourself, Pa.
Now, listen, Pa.
I don't think
this here draft's such a bad idea.
I mean, I'd kind of like to go.
There's a whole lot of fellas there
and they all march along right, snappy like.
You listen to me, boy.
Going in the draft
don't mean just going into town.
It means Macon and Atlanta
and still further.
I've been to Atlanta, you know that.
When I was no older than you.
I told you how them folks laughed at me
and called me smart names.
You don't want that, boy.
- Pa, now ain't the same as it was then.
- Dogged if it ain't.
But they want me. They even sent a fella
to come and fetch me, didn't they?
And that ain't all.
Last spring, I seen a sign on the sidewalk
down there in town.
This great big old picture of Uncle Sam.
"And Uncle Sam wants you,"
he's a-saying.
Just like this fellow here, Pa,
pointing his finger right straight in my face.
Don't you think a soldier fella
come up to me right then and there...
...inviting me to come along
with all the other fellas?
I told him how you was ailing then...
...and would he kindly wait a while.
You've been tearing up them letters,
ain't you, Pa?
And you ain't ailing no more.
- Hey, are you coming or do I have to...
- I'm just fixing to get me my shoes.
You've got to know this:
He's a good boy.
It's my blame
he didn't come when he should've.
I don't care who or why, mister.
We got him now.
Remember, Pa?
I got these here for Aunt Tuzie's funeral.
Ain't it nice I'm finally getting a chance
to wear them again?
Appears they liked to have shrunk a little.
They'll put shoes on you in Army.
And ain't gonna wait
for you to put them on.
Listen, draft man, you tell them folks
to be nice to my boy, you hear?
- lf they ain't, I'll...
- I'm ready.
Say goodbye to Blue for me
when he wakes up, will you?
I will.
- Write to me regular, you hear?
- Sure, Pa.
Print big.
I will.
Remember, draft man, what I said.
- lf they ain't good to my boy...
- Yeah, I'll remember.
Come on, boy, we gotta go.
- Bye, Pa.
- Bye, Will.

Hey, you.
This the group going to the Air Force?
That's where I'm driving the bus to.
You want a reserved seat?
All right.
Save the jokes for the plowboys.
Fill it out. Last name, first name,
middle name last.
- I know, I know, I know.
- Fill it out.
Hey, look,
they're bringing a fella in bracelets.
Finally latched onto him, Mr. McKinney?
- Did he give you any trouble?
- Trouble?
Ain't no draft dodger
gonna give me any trouble.
Had to borrow the sheriff's handcuffs.
That'll hold you
till I get you on that bus.
- But, Mr. McKinney, I ain't dodging nothing.
- Shut up.
Let me have it.
Fill it out. Last name first, first name,
middle name last. Lean on the pump.
- Last name first...
- First name, middle name last.
Huh.
- All right, any you boys had any ROTC?
- I did. Close to a year.
- What's your name?
- Blanchard, Irving S.
Irving? Okay, Irving.
I'm setting you in charge
of this here group.
When you
get to your classification center...
...give these forms
to the sergeant of your barracks.
- What about him?
- Keep them cuffs on him. Here are the keys.
It took me three months
to flush him out of them hills...
...so see that he don't get away.
Come on in my office, Dave,
I'll give you your money.
Whew.
You hear what he said, Plowboy?
I don't want any trouble, you understand?
- Me, neither, Irving.
- My name's Blanchard to you.
It's a real pleasure.
You getting smart with me, Plowboy?
I don't wanna hear one peep out of you.
Not one peep.
All right, I ain't had my morning coffee,
so I ain't gonna wait around to see you off.
Now, Irving here's in charge.
Callville is proud of her sons in uniform...
...so show them
what kind of men we raise here.
And be good.
And if you can't be good, be careful.
Rosabelle!
Pa.
Get on home!
Yes, Pa.
I told you to stay home this time!
Dang it.
All right, all right,
into the bus when I call your name.
- Deroy, Richard S.
- Here.
- Farnum, Robert E.
- Here.
- Hooper, Junior C.
- Here.
- Lemon, Henry P.
- Here.
- Stockdale, Will.
- Uh... Here.
I'll get around to you.
- Swineburn, Armand A.
- Here.
Whitledge, Benjamin B.
Whitledge, Benjamin B.
Here, here. Whitledge, here.
- Benjamin B. Is Mr. McKinney here?
- Who?
Mr. McKin... Mr. McKinney, the man
on the draft board. I got a letter for him.
Take it easy, sonny. You just missed him.
- Oh, I gotta find him. I got a letter for him.
- He left me in charge.
Hey, give me that. That's a private letter.
It's official business for Mr. McKinney.
Don't you understand English?
I'm in charge.
And here, fill out that form.
- That's a private letter, you big...
- Hey.
Don't get sore at Irving, feller.
He's had ROTC.
That doesn't give him the right
to push me around.
Hey, you put your last name first,
and then your first name.
Like this.
Stockdale, Will. Will Stockdale.
Stockdale. Stockdale?
All you need is one of each.
Is that all?
Wise guy. Oh.
Much obliged.
What's the matter with you?
Oh, they think I'm a draft dodger,
but I ain't.
Here, give me.
You can't write good with handcuffs.
Thanks. Can't write much good
without them. Heh.
- "Ever had measles?"
- No.
- "The mumps?"
- No.
- "Chickenpox?"
- No.
- "Any other communicable diseases?"
- I reckon not.
You figure
they gonna make me go back home?
- "Ever break any bones?"
- Broke a leg bone once.
- "Which leg?"
- The r... No, it was the left.
Yeah, left. Left.
"Any member of your family
belong to groups...
...planning to overthrow the government
by unconstitutional means?"
No, we're pretty satisfied.
- He still limps a mite.
- Who does?
That fellow whose leg bone I broke.
He hit me first.
You ever have ROTC?
No.
Hey, Irving had it. Close to a year.
He's so jumpy and all,
I figure he's still got a touch of it in him.
- Listen, Stockdale, ROTC...
- Will's my name.
- Will, listen, ROTC ain't...
- What was yours again?
- Ben. Ben Whitledge. ROTC...
- Howdy.
Hi.
Look, Will, ROTC ain't a disease.
It's training.
Reserve Officer Training, uh, Corporation.
- Heh. Is that the truth?
- Oh, sure. There's different kinds.
There's cavalry ROTC,
artillery ROTC, infantry ROTC.
- Infantry's the best.
- Yeah, that's what I always thought.
- Ben, Irving ain't sick?
- No.
And he don't rank no higher
than we do.
Because ROTC don't mean nothing
unless you finish the course.
IRVING:
Hey, get this.
"So I beg of you, Mr. McKinney.
Please get my enclosed letter
to the commanding officer in the Air Force."
Hey, you can't read that.
"So that my son Ben
will be put in the infantry...
...the same as his six brothers
before him."
Give me that, you big... Let go.
Let... Let go of me!
"All his life, little Ben has been dreaming
of being a real infantry soldier...
...like all the men in our family."
Little Ben
wanna be a great big soldier?
Irving?
That letter belongs to Ben.
Now, you give it to him.
I told you
to keep your mouth shut, Plowboy.
"lt'll break his poor heart if he's put
in the Air Force instead of the infantry...
...so his brothers will be proud of him."
Irving, you ain't sick like I thought,
so you give Ben his letter.
Listen, Plowboy.
Yeah, sure.
I imagine it's time for us
to get going, ain't it?
So I'd thank you
if you'd take these off, Irving.
- They're beginning to chafe me a mite.
- Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
All right, let's stop kidding around here.
Climb aboard there. Snappy now.
Why, sure, Irving.
All right, move along. Move along.
So long, boys.
Don't take any wooden nickels.
I appreciate if you write me how much
it cost to get it fixed, Mr. McKinney.
Bye.
WILL:
MAN 1: Hey.
MAN 2: Why, there's the sergeant.
Please, let's keep it quiet.
On behalf
of the president of the United States...
...Secretary of the Air Force, commanders
of this base and this squadron...
...I wanna welcome you, gentlemen,
to the United States Air Force.
This is a classification center where you will
undergo tests, both physical and mental...
...designed to determine your abilities
so that you may be trained...
...for the position
from which both you and the Air Force...
...will derive the greatest benefit.
Tests are for you own good,
so do your best in every test.
My name is King.
K-l-N-G, Sergeant King.
I'm in charge of the barracks
where you will be billeted for two weeks.
During that period,
the barracks will be kept spotlessly clean.
This may be a stopping off place for you,
but for me, it is home.
Before turning in tonight, every one of you
will write a letter to his nearest of kin...
...informing them that you have
arrived safely and are in the best of health.
If any problem should arise,
feel free to consult me about its solution.
I am here to help you...
...during these first difficult days
of military service.
These are my quarters.
Knock before entering.
- That understood?
MEN: Yes, sir.
Roger.
Wilco.
Seemed like a right friendly fella.
Be right back.
Come in.
Private Blanchard...
...delivering forms on 12 inductees
from Callville as ordered.
You keep standing like that,
you're gonna pull a muscle.
Just put them down.
Not on the bed, please.
Anything else?
Sergeant, I feel it's my duty to tell you
about one of the Callville inductees.
Fella named Stockdale. A draft dodger.
He gave me a lot of trouble.
Not on the bed, please.
I was put in charge
and he gave me a lot of trouble.
They brought him to the bus in these.
I'll make a note of it.
I think he'll need some disciplinary action.
He already hit one of the fellas
with a gasoline pump.
- In the barracks here?
- No, back at the bus station.
I'll make a note of it.
I thought he ought to be reported
to the squadron commander.
- Oh, no.
- Well, I mean, I think it's my duty to...
Any reporting done around here, I do it.
Sure you do. And this fella Stockdale's
a real troublemaker.
Look, sonny,
how long have you been in the service?
About six hours, I guess.
I had ROTC though.
I suppose they told you
it was all efficiency...
...standing at attention, running around.
Well, I've been in for 18 years
and it ain't like you think it is at all.
It's a quiet, peaceful life,
if you mind your own business.
It's like there was a big lake,
nice and calm.
I'm in a canoe, you're in another,
the captain's in a canoe and the colonel.
You know what you do if you report
somebody or complain about somebody...
...or request something?
You make waves.
Well, I thought the captain would wanna
know if he's got a troublemaker.
I hate to pull rank on you,
but for your information...
...you got the smallest canoe
in the whole lake. Good night, private.
ANNOUNCER :
Hey, Ben,
do you put a big "S" on "sergeant"?
When you print it,
it don't make no difference, Will.
Oh. Boy, Pa'll sure be happy...
...about how Sergeant King
said it was really a home.
- No, come on, Ben, you take the bottom.
- No, Will.
- But, honest, I like sleeping high.
- No, sir. You sat on the bottom bunk first.
I didn't mean nothing by it.
Honest, I didn't.
First come, first serve.
That's the military way.
- No, now come on, Ben.
- I won't, I tell you!
- Now, come on.
- Let that man alone, Stockdale.
I'm beginning to think I never should've
taken the cuffs off of you.
Well, Irving, I wasn't doing nothing.
I was just...
Look, if you want some fighting,
you go after somebody your own size.
- Not some little mouse.
- Watch your mouth!
Why don't you mind your own business?
We're just stopping him
from wrestling you around.
That's between him and me,
nobody asked you.
Now, Ben, don't...
- Only trying to do you a favor, junior.
- Who you calling Junior?
Who asked you anything, anyhow?
All right,
if that's the way you feel about it.
You wanna be buddies with draft dodger,
be buddies with the draft dodger. Go ahead.
- That's the way I feel about it.
- All right, before there's trouble...
...you hit the sack.
Get to bed, both of you.
I was just going to, Irving.
BRONCO: Give him time, Irving,
beds is strange to Plowboy.
He's used to sleeping with the hogs.
- What's the matter with you, anyhow?
- Me?
Taking their insults
and heehawing like a dang donkey.
They don't mean nothing by it, Ben.
Besides, I thought that one about sleeping
with the hogs is kind of funny.
- Aww...
- Heh-heh.
Well, see,
I figure if we just laugh with them...
...why, pretty soon they'll get tired
of carrying on, there won't be no ruckus.
You think
a-laughing is gonna stop these guys?
A-licking is all they understand.
- You think so?
- I know so.
And you behaving like a dang donkey.
MAN 1:
Oh, what's he holding?
MAN 2: You know...?
MAN 3: Oh, yeah.
I'm through.
- Yeah, I've had enough.
- Me too.
Yeah.
Lonesome for the hogs, Plowboy?
Ain't used to living indoors,
are you, Plowboy?
Look, Plowboy,
you want us to tuck you in bed?
I bet your pa always tucked you in
nice and comfy.
Wonder what kind of hog his pa is.
Chester White or Poland China?
I ain't gonna trouble you fellas none...
...because I know you was all
just put up to it.
Excuse me.
Irving, stand up
and take off them glasses.
- Why?
- I aim to bust you up some.
Look, Stockdale, I'm not alone now.
There's five of us here.
MAN 1: Hit him!
MAN 2: Hey, do not, Plowboy.
MAN 3:
Come on.
MAN 4: Time out.
MAN 5: Come on, Plowboy, hit him.
MAN 6:
That's the end of it.
MAN 7: Come on, man.
MAN 8: Come on.
Knock it off. Knock it off.
Knock it off!
Aren't you gentlemen starting in a bit early
to tip over my canoe?
Sergeant, let me try to explain.
Shut up.
No, I am not in the mood
for explanations.
I am quite tired.
You understand?
And I want no more noise.
You understand, gentlemen?
I will be more than willing
to listen to explanations in the morning.
And as morning likes to come
a little early in the service...
...we'll help it along.
We won't wait for taps.
Get to your bunks.
On the double! Ooh!
He seems a mite upset.
Oh, Will.
We better put Irving in his bed.
He won't wanna disobey the sergeant.
You get his feet.
Let him alone, please, Will.
He'll wake up
and cause some more trouble.
Yeah, I reckon he might.
- Pretty good fight, though, wasn't it?
- Dog it, Will, this'll mess up everything.
- What will, Ben?
- Fighting in the barracks.
But you said
licking was all they'd understand.
Not in the barracks.
One of them's bound to snitch tomorrow
that we started a fight.
Dog it, I'll never get in the infantry now.
If we kept our mouths shut and didn't
do nothing, we might get transferred.
Both of us?
But now,
they're sure to tell about the fight.
No, they won't.
If one of them says anything, I'll take him
out in the back and whomp him good.
Now, there you go, Will.
You think
the infantry wants men like that?
No, they want men who can take it
and keep their mouths shut...
...the way a man ought to do.
Transfer?
We'll be lucky
if they don't transfer us into the Navy.
Walking around
in them little old white uniforms.
Do you really want both of us
to transfer, Ben?
Don't you understand, Will?
It's the infantry does the real fighting.
All the rest is just helpers.
Look at the War Between the States.
How about that?
Yeah. How about that?
See what I mean?
Every man
in my family's been in the infantry...
...clear back to my great grandpa.
You know what he done?
Fought with Stonewall Jackson
at Chancellorsville.
Licked him good too, I bet.
By dog.
First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna get
sergeant's permission to see the captain.
I'll give him Ma's letter and I'll...
And I'll...
Oh, what's the use?
What's the use?
Hey. Hey, Ben,
maybe you'll get to like the Air Force.
Zooming all over the sky and shouting
"roger" and "wilco" and everything.
Maybe it won't be so bad.
Bad?
You know what they call men
in the Air Force?
Airmen.
Like something out of a dang funny book.
Airman.
How you gonna like it
when somebody calls you "airman"?
By dog, I just don't think I'll stand for it.
MAN 1: Hey, long as we gotta lie in the
dark, give us a chance to get some sleep.
- Knock it off.
MAN 2: Yeah, hit the...
Airman.
Somebody brung their trumpet.
Hey, Ben.
Hey. Hey, Ben.
All right, I'm up, I'm up.
All right, I'm up. All right, I'm up.
All right, I'm up.
Howdy, I'm Will Stockdale.
I didn't hear the whistle.
Tell the men to line up.
If the captain comes around,
tell him I'm checking on who overslept.
I'll be out there just as quick as I can...
It's 12:00 at night.
It is?
Oh...
That's a prettiest watch.
You woke me.
Well, you said to knock before entering.
Why did you wake me?
This ain't nothing personal
against you, sergeant...
...no, that we don't like your barracks
no, nothing like that.
What it is, is Ben's got these six brothers
that's all infantry.
That's my new buddy Ben,
that's asleep out there?
So naturally,
he don't wanna be in no Air Force. Heh-heh.
I mean, with the infantry doing the real
fighting and the Air Force being the helpers.
Well, you know,
like in the War Between the States?
So he wants to transfer and he wants me
to go along with him.
I figured you could do it for us. Heh-heh.
I heard what you said out there...
...about how you was here to help us
during first difficult days of military service.
Why do they send all the bums
and the idiots to my barracks?
- They do?
- Yes.
Yes, they do.
Sure must be a mess.
- Whatever your name is, get out...
- Stockdale.
Stockdale, I want you to get out of this...
Stockdale?
Don't you come near me.
Get out of this room and get back
in your bunk and go to sleep. That's all.
Yes, sir.
Ben did say
the captain was the one to see...
- Stockdale, where you going?
- To the captain.
Oh, no.
But Ben, he knows all
about doing things military and...
Oh, no. You can't, you can't. You just:
Oh, you can't do it.
Captain would just as soon
rip off your stripes as look at you.
- Well, I ain't got no stripes.
- Wait a minute.
Now, you'll never get transfers
by waking up the captain.
He won't understand.
Believe me, he won't.
- Well, I'll go over it real slow.
- Wait a minute.
Now, if you want the captain
to do you a favor...
...you've gotta do a favor
for the captain.
Yeah, that's it.
Now, how would you like to do
a big favor for the captain?
- Me?
- Come on. That's it.
Come on. You do one for him,
he'll do one for me and I'll do one for you.
That's the way it works out in the service.
Now you just go right on in here.
Now do you know what this is?
It's a kind of a big outhouse, ain't it?
- We call it the latrine.
- La... Latrine.
- Uh-huh.
- Heh. How about that?
You might say it's the captain's hobby,
he inspects it every chance he gets.
And when it sparkles,
why he sparkles too.
Now, you get it all cleaned up.
You are the officer in charge.
In charge?
Every last one of them, all yours.
Golly.
Now, you just stay right here
and don't go no place.
- You bet. Good night.
- Good night.
Hey, thank you.
Well, it just goes to show you...
...how good things happen to you
when you're least expecting them.
Well, get started.
WILL:
Beautiful.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
- Beautiful.
- Shucks, it ain't hard.
Wait'll the captain sees this.
He inspects this
like it was an operating room...
...where somebody
was gonna cut out his heart.
Never in your life you've seen such a guy
for sticking his head right down into things.
- You figure he'll like what I done?
- He'll be a new man.
Will, how would you like
to be permanent latrine orderly?
- Permanent latrine orderly?
- PLO.
Golly.
The captain makes inspection
every Saturday.
Now, if you could keep everything
as clean as it is right now...
...the captain'll get off my back.
Gee, I'd sure like to, sergeant...
...but I was kind of set on helping Ben
get them transfers.
You know, he's my buddy.
Ain't I your buddy?
You are.
You help me out, I'll help Ben.
Just don't say anything about this
outside of this room.
I'm going to the record section and fix it up
with a couple of friends of mine.
Okay.
Sergeant, don't I have to take them tests
you was talking about yesterday...
...and get myself classified?
No, Will, you've been classified.
If we hurry, we can catch that picture
at the base theater.
Not me, Ben.
- You said you ain't never seen a picture.
- I know, but I got my duty to do.
- You're going back to that latrine again?
- You bet.
It's against the rules for you
to be permanent in the latrine like that.
All week you've been there.
Sergeant King knows the rules, don't he?
Besides, like I told you,
he's doing me and you a favor.
- What favor, will you tell me that?
- I aim to surprise you, Ben.
You don't go to lectures or study,
how you gonna get classified?
Sergeant King says I'm already that way.
- Are you crazy? Don't you...?
- Now, don't take on so, Ben.
Just wait and see what the captain says
after he makes his inspection tomorrow.
Why you take them faucets, for instance.
I polished them so hard,
they don't say hot and cold no more.
What?
At ease.
I think you'll be very pleased here, sir.
Attention.
Latrine ready for inspection, sir.
This is incredible.
This is absolutely incredible.
I am pleased.
No.
- No, I am happy.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.
- You the one on latrine duty today, private?
- Yes, sir. All week, sir.
- Ahem, ahem.
- You are to be congratulated.
Just look at...
What did you say?
Me? Nothing, sir.
- Something about all week.
- Uh...
Well, I done my best in one day,
but just to be fair with you...
...it took me a week
of scrubbing to get it like this.
Is this man being punished
for some infraction?
- Oh, no, sir. No, sir.
- Oh, heck no, sir. I'm PLO.
- You're what?
- Permanent latrine orderly.
Stockdale.
Oh, but don't credit me none though, sir.
It's all Sergeant King's doings.
He even got it fixed up
so I don't even have to get classified.
- Sir, I...
- What? That's impossible.
Oh, no, sir.
He fixed it with some friends of his.
Yes, sir.
It was him got me to work so hard...
...telling me how latrines
is your hobby...
...and sticking your head
down into things and all.
- Sir, I can explain every...
- Now, don't you be bashful, sergeant.
Sir, I been wanting to tell you
about what a good sergeant he is.
Oh, he solves our problems for us...
...and helps us out on our difficult days
in military service.
And I guess that he's
about the best dang sergeant there is...
...in the whole danged Air Force.
Sir, you really ought to get up
off of his back.
How long have you been a sergeant?
- Well, sir, I... Ahem.
- Speak up.
Sixteen years, sir.
And how long do you expect
to remain a sergeant?
Twelve years.
You will remain a sergeant
exactly one week. One week.
Unless this man completes
the entire classification process...
...and is shipped out with the group
he came in with. Understand?
Unless this man is out of here
by the end of the week...
...you will not be in charge of this barracks,
you will not be a sergeant...
...you will in all probability
be a permanent latrine orderly.
PLO.
This is not your fault, private.
You've done a fine job.
I have never seen such a clean latrine
in my entire career.
Thank you, sir.
It was my aim to get it just as clean
as that operating room...
...where they're fixing
to cut out your heart!
You forgot to ask him
about the transfers.
What happened? What did you do it for?
Heck, I couldn't see no sense
in me getting all the credit.
We've gotta get you classified right away.
We gotta get you out of here.
You don't want me around no more?
I thought we was buddies.
It ain't what I want,
it's what the captain wants.
Now, we gotta get you classified
in a hurry.
You're gonna have to take tests and you're
going to have to talk to a lot of people.
And you're going to have to work
real hard.
Will it help Ben and me
get them transfers?
Well, I guarantee you, wherever you go,
they'll bust a gut to get you transferred.
Well, I'll work hard all right,
but I don't know.
The last test I took
was close on to five years ago...
...and that was one of them tests...
...where you try this fella's toothpaste
for 10 days...
...and see if your teeth don't get brighter.
And I failed.
You been admiring this watch of mine,
haven't you?
I sure have, sergeant.
That there's the prettiest watch I ever seen.
You get shipped out of here
by Saturday morning like the captain said...
...and it's yours.
- Mine?
- Yours.
Golly.
- Now you'll work real hard, right?
- Right.
- And not waste any time?
- No, sir.
Good boy.
Now first thing Monday morning,
we start classification.
You stay right here around the barracks
and get a lot of rest...
...and relax your head.
I'm going down to the testing area
and see if I can borrow some of the tests.
Okay.
Tell them I'll give them back
just like I did the toothpaste.
WILL:
Time's up, pal.
It was right friendly of you
to wait for me.
Thank you.
- How'd you think you did, Will?
- Well, them printed tests they give us...
...they was exactly like the ones
that you borrowed...
Only what?
Only you spent so much time
drumming the answers into me...
...we ought to have spent a little more
on the questions they joint up with.
Now, you just sit right down here
and wait.
Come on, Will, the corporal's waiting.
Here he is, corporal.
Awfully sorry to keep you waiting.
What we do here, private,
is to evaluate your manual dexterity...
...on a time scale
in relation to digital visual coordination.
Two irregular steel links
which can be interconnected thusly.
I separate them, I join them.
It will be your task,
when I give the signal...
...to place the two links
in an interconnected relationship...
...I have just demonstrated.
Uh...
I put them together?
That's right, you put them together.
I'll time you
and three minutes is passing.
Now, whatever you do,
don't get nervous.
Ready. Go.
There you go.
Attaboy.
- Put them together.
- Sergeant, please.
Nobody ever does this
in less than two minutes.
You're not even supposed to be in here.
This is a special case. He has to go out
with the group he came in with.
- It's is a very difficult test.
- I couldn't do it myself.
- What are you talking about?
- I want you to get out of here.
- I'd just like to see you try to do it.
- This is my department.
- He's my department.
- That's my door. Get out.
- Get out right this minute.
- Throw me out.
You're not supposed to be here.
This is my watch...
- All right, then watch your watch...
- I'm done.
Stop the watch.
- Look. Look at that.
- He put them together, didn't he?
Sergeant! Sergeant!
What's the fuss about? You said,
"Put them together," he put them together.
Look what he did, for Pete's sake.
How am I gonna mark him on that?
You're supposed to be grading him on this.
Can't you do that?
I'm supposed to mark it down
whether they put it back together or not...
...and there ain't supposed to be
but one way of doing it and he didn't do it.
How you gonna mark him
on a thing like that?
Who do you think's gonna pay for these?
Sixteen dollars, they cost.
- lf you think I'm gonna pay $ 16...
- Corporal!
Sixteen lousy dollars!
Corporal, I'll be glad to pay
the 16 lousy dollars.
- You will?
- lf he passed the test.
He did it wrong.
He was supposed to do it a certain way.
Will, will you step outside
for a minute, have a smoke.
Now, corporal,
let's look at this thing logically.
You need money
and I need him to pass the test.
But he did do it completely wrong.
- Ben?
- Will.
I ain't seen you all day.
You been in there classifying?
- Yeah.
- Me too. Find out where you're going?
Sergeant King says
maybe gunnery school.
That's where I'm going too
if I pass the eye test.
- How about that?
- Yeah, how about that?
Oh, Ben, you ain't still sad
about not being in the infantry?
The captain didn't even read my letter.
And that plan of yours
sure didn't work so good.
I tried to ask the psychiatrist
if he could fix me up.
- Yeah, what'd he say?
- He didn't say nothing.
I don't think he understands so good.
I'm just stuck in the Air Force, that's all.
Hey, Ben, maybe it's the Air Force
that's the real fighters...
...and the infantry's just the helpers.
Never.
Well, Ben, all you can do
is look at it that way.
No. Wait'll my brothers find out. Airman.
Private.
What kind of rowdydow is this?
Pick up that cap.
Yes, sir.
- Is that a way to treat government property?
- No, sir, ma'am.
We're excited because we're
maybe going to the same school.
That's no excuse for...
What's the matter with this one?
- Have you been drinking?
- No, no, sir.
Get at attention, Will.
We're sending this to school?
Yes, sir, ma'am. If he passes the eye test,
he'll be going to gunnery school.
As what? A target?
No, sir, ma'am.
Let's have no more rowdydow, understand?
No more.
Yes, sir. Ma'am.
What's the matter with you, anyhow?
Don't you know enough
to come to attention and salute an officer?
- She was a woman.
- Sure she was.
Ain't you ever heard
of the Women's Air Force?
You mean they got one too?
Sure.
- Against ours?
- No, Will. They're with us.
They're with us 100 percent.
- We got to salute them?
- The officers, we do.
Didn't you hear that lecture
about military courtesy?
I'll be dogged.
I never heard of saluting no woman before.
She ain't a woman, she's a captain.
I seen a captain there
so I come to attention and saluted.
A captain, that's all.
- A woman captain.
- A "captain" captain.
By dog,
don't you understand nothing, Will?
When you're in uniform,
you ain't supposed to notice...
...whether a person is a man or a woman
or what.
A captain's a captain, a major's a major
and a general's a general.
Ben, you mean to tell me that you
didn't notice that she was a woman?
A captain, that's all I seen.
Well, dog it, Ben,
I knew she was a woman right off.
Honest, Will, sometimes I wonder
how come they took you in the draft at all.
Come on, Will.
You too, Whitledge.
Well, Will, it looks like you're just liable
to get classified after all.
Just shows you
what the Air Force has come down to.
- This the fella you want? Whitledge?
- Yeah.
Psychiatrist says
he has a secondary anxiety...
...with inferiority
and systematized delusions of persecution.
I ain't surprised.
Recommends he be considered
to be transferred to the infantry.
The infantry?
Don't get excited.
He didn't say you have to.
Well, yeah, but that's what
Ben's always been wanting, corporal.
- Just you tell me what I have to do.
- Well, here. Fill this out.
When he's finished, buck it through
to the colonel for approval.
If he's crazy enough to want it.
How about that, Ben? You made it.
Just wait'll my brothers hear about this.
- Stockdale?
- Yeah.
Okay, psychiatrist.
Oh, Lord, psychiatrist.
Now, Will, listen carefully.
The psychiatrist test is one
where I couldn't get copies of questions...
...because there ain't any.
The doctor asks you
whatever happens to pop into his head.
- So keep your wits about you.
- I'll try.
Hey. Hey.
Hey, maybe he'll give me
a transfer too, huh, Ben?
He'll ask you things like
what do you dream?
Okay.
Hey, maybe he'll give me a transfer too,
huh, Ben?
Sure, Will.
- The psychiatrist is waiting, Stockdale.
- Coming.
Wait a minute.
The safest thing I guess is
just say that you never dream at all.
- Okay. See you later, Ben.
- No dreams.
Sergeant?
Do you think he can?
Can what?
Get transferred too.
Maybe you could talk to the doctor.
Now, don't you complicate things.
I never have no dreams at all.
- Where are you from, Stockdale?
- Georgia.
That's not much of a state, is it?
Well, I don't live all over the state.
I just live in this one little place in it.
That's where Tobacco Road is. Georgia.
Not around my section.
Maybe you're from a different part
than me.
I've never been there. What's more,
I don't think I would ever wanna go there.
What's your reaction to that?
Well, I don't know...
I would rather live in the rottenest pigsty
in Tennessee or Alabama...
...than the fanciest mansion
in all of Georgia.
How about that?
Well, sir, I think
where you wanna live is your business.
You don't mind if someone says
something bad about Georgia?
I ain't heard nobody
say nothing bad about Georgia.
Well, what do you think
I've been saying?
Well, to tell you the truth, sir...
