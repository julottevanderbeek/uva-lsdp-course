Pull!
Hurry Up!
To your posts!
All right! Make your way forward!
The man who brings me
their General's head will get a reward!
See you later!
Wait a minute!
It's Bazuso!
The one who killed 30 men?!
And a bear?!
How about it?
If you want your head smashed in,
step right up!
What are you doing?
Defeat him and you'll be famous!
Go on!
You go!
He's too tough for me.
Goddamn bunch of mercenaries!
Listen to that coward!
His balls have shrunk up inside of him!
Men! Have no mercy!
Gouge out their eyes!
Pull out their innards!
We'll feed them to the pigs!
Who's that?
He's still a kid!
Who's he with?
What a sword!
Look at him act tough.
He'll get his head split open!
He is fighting the Bazuso!
Give me ten.
What?!
The price for this scrap of iron here.
We mercenaries, aren't knights.
I can't feed myself with glory.
Bet against Bazuso?!
Brave words!
Fine! Bring him down and I'll
give you seven pieces of silver.
Cheap bastard.
Oh, well...
You'll be sorry, boy.
You're going to lose your head...
for seven pieces of silver!
H-He's fast!
Hey! Bazuso's getting pushed back!
What's going on? No one's done
that to Bazuso before!
Who is he?!
Damn it!
I'm going to put
a stop to you now!
W-Wait!
You are definitely the better man!
I, Bazuso am...!
Bazuso's been...!
Now! They've lost their confidence!
Charge!
That guy's really something.
I wonder who he's with.
Don't get carried away.
We just got here too late.
Blame it on that stupid general.
It's not our fault.
Hey, Griffith! I wonder
who's stronger, you or him?
Don't ask stupid questions.
Of course, it's Griffith.
All right! Next!
Two months' salary...
and your reward for this battle.
Are you sure you won't reconsider?
It's triple the salary, and maybe
you'll even be a squire one day.
That's an impossible dream for
most mercenaries, you know.
Dream? You can't eat dreams.
W-Wait!
It's guaranteed money and status.
What's your problem with that?
I hate being restrained.
Next!
Bandits, huh?
All right! Go!
Shit!
Just you wait!
He's killing us.
Now what?
Corkus is shitting himself.
The guy's really tough.
Him taking down Bazuso was no fluke.
What do we do?
Told you so.
Casca...
Go help him.
Why? It was Corkus's idea!
Yeah, Okay.
Go get him!
Why? You started this!
You get him!
Oh, no!
No!
Oh, shit!
Pull back!
Thanks!
What's with that length?
A sin?
You bastard!
He's even pushing Casca back.
That's impossible.
Griffith!
Careful! He's strong!
Griffith?
That's it for you!
Get him, Griffith!
Could you sheathe your sword?
No?
He's fast!
Amazing! In just one blow!
Griffith...
Hey!
What's going on?
Where am I? Why are you here?
Griffith should've just killed you
and left you!
Why, you...
That's for my horse!
Shit...
That bitch!
All right, this one!
Be grateful to Casca.
She lay with you for two days
to keep you warm after you lost all that blood.
What?!
On Griffith's orders.
He says it's a woman's job to keep men warm.
Damn it, Judeau!
Sorry!
So you're awake.
Griffith! Good morning.
I'm Griffith. What's your name?
Guts.
This is an amazing sword.
I could never wield it.
Will you come with me?
Hi, Griffith!
Griffith!
Hey!
You're really popular.
Hey...
So good!
So that bastard's up and around?
Griffith?
I'm getting a strange feeling...
Where am I?
You're with the Band of the Hawk.
Heard of us?
The last mercenaries you want
to face on the battlefield.
They gave us a lot of trouble
in the last battle.
So it was these guys?
Yes. We're the Band of the Hawk.
Such a nice view!
Why?
Why did you deliberately miss my heart?
You could have done it easily.
It's because I want you, Guts.
What, you swing that way?
I saw your duel with Bazuso.
It was very admirable.
But it was a close call.
If his battle axe wasn't cracked...
he would have split your head open.
Probably.
You're honest.
You fight like you're trying to see
how much you can get away with.
To me, it looked like you were
intentionally exposing yourself to danger...
but at the same time,
you're also struggling to survive.
That's just how it felt.
I like you.
I want you, Guts.
And if I say no?
You don't want to?
Yeah, I refuse!
Talking like you know everything...
stabbing someone...
and then acting like you're their friend...
I'll settle it with this.
If I win, I get to stab you...
in the chest just like you did to me.
And if I win?
You can make me your soldier or
your piece of ass... do whatever you want.
All right.
I don't mind doing things by force.
Griffith!
Stay back, Casca.
But...
I always get what I want.
That's what I don't like about you.
You don't have any respect!
Shit!
Hey, look!
The guy just won't quit!
Griffith  stay out of it.
We can do this another day.
You're still weak.
Fuck you!
- Griffith!
- That's not fair!
You'll do anything to win.
I'm liking you more and more.
But you can't move your sword now.
What do you want to do?
You can quit now if you like.
You sure like to run your mouth.
But in a real fight,
you have to use your mouth...
like this!
Griffith!
How does your own blood taste?
I bet no one has ever hit that
pretty face of yours before.
I hate to show you up in front of your men,
but this ends now!
- Yes! He did it!
- Amazing!
That was effective...
But it's over now.
You give up...
or I'll dislocate your shoulder.
It's your choice.
You piece of shit!
Oh man! He kicked his ass!
And now you're mine.
Griffith has never said
that to anyone before!
So now I'm in the Band of the Hawk.
Guts, I'm going to have you fight...
For something dear to my heart.
I will get my own kingdom.
Guts, I'll be the one to decide
the place where you'll die.
Hold your ranks!
Show those Chuder dogs
what Midlanders are made of!
Don't let them escape!
Kill anything that moves!
Their Black Ram Iron Lance Heavy Cavalry
is inflicting heavy damage!
At this rate even our headquarters
here may be in danger!
Isn't there anyone...
who can stop those black devils of Chuder?
Forward!
The Black Ram Iron Lance Heavy Cavalry
will take the head of the King of Midland!
Fool!
One man against all of us?
Fine then!
I'll ride right over him!
- He killed General Gien!
- With one blow, by himself!
He's alone! Surround him!
But...
What's that?!
From behind!
That's...
the Band of the Hawk!
The grim reapers of the battlefield!
Why are they fighting for Midland?!
Chuder is retreating.
Impossible!
One band of mercenaries can't possibly
turn the tide of the whole battle!
Is this "Band of the Hawk" strong?
Yes. They were well worth the price.
Do not put too much stock
into one surprise attack.
But they defeated the Black Rams,
when we could not.
And the brilliance of their attack,
and how they anticipated the enemy...
Who leads them?
He is called Griffith, Sire.
"Griffith"?
Guts!
That was amazing!
A bit too cool, maybe, riding out there alone.
Sorry. I shouldn't have charged them alone.
As if he ever felt sorry!
Yeah! That's not like the Captain.
Anyway, we won. Let's celebrate.
Yes! Let's have a toast!
Then follow me!
Why Corkus?
It was Guts who did a great deed!
Guts!
I need to talk to you.
Will you give me a minute?
"Captain Guts, Sir"?
What was that about?
What?
Don't play dumb!
You were supposed to be a diversion.
Instead you charged them head-on by yourself.
It worked out well this time,
but you could have put
the entire Band of the Hawk in danger.
Remember your place.
Sorry. I'll keep that in mind.
It's always the same!
Just talk.
You haven't changed in three years.
You're satisfied just waving
a sword around on the battlefield.
You're a mad dog who never thinks
about your comrades one bit!
You're wrong. I'm not like I was!
I think about my comrades...
That's enough.
Griffith!
I'll speak to Guts.
You're too easy on him, Griffith.
You two really don't get along, do you?
It's not me.
She's always on my case.
It's been like this for three years.
Give it a rest.
Three years...
Yes, since you and I fought.
I enjoyed that.
I like that kind of fight.
Let's go. You're the man of the hour tonight.
Griffith...
I'm sorry... about today's battle.
Guts, fight for my sake.
Since you're mine.
Have you heard about Lord Griffith?
Yes, it is most disturbing.
It is true we have not been defeated
since the Band of the Hawk joined us, but...
They are mercenaries,
led by a man who can be bought.
Without war, they are nothing but bandits.
To elevate riff-raff like that...
Yes. The low-born are low-born.
Nothing good can come about from
treating them  something more.
But without them, Chuder might
have destroyed us by now.
I can understand why His Majesty
would have gone to all this trouble...
But Still...
Yes, but still.
Raising a commoner to nobility...
It is an eccentric choice by His Majesty.
They say the Band of the Hawk led
our armies in the last battle.
Then what of Count Julius and
his White Dragon Knights?
He's being relieved.
The ransom was quite high
when Chuder took him prisoner...
The enemy Count is dead.
Gut's Raiders are still inside
mopping up the resistance.
That's unusual for it to be taking so long.
I didn't think this castle
would be this hard to take.
Why didn't you report sooner?!
Someone said there was
treasure deep inside the castle.
And then we started hearing screams...
No one came out.
Enough! I'll go look.
Let go, Gaston!
We should go ask General Griffith
for reinforcements.
Do that and I'll kill you!
Captain!
Don't follow me!
What happened to these corpses?
What...
is that?!
Nosferatu Zodd?
Yeah, it looks like he's on
the enemy's side in this battle.
Zodd, you mean
the legendary swordsman?
They say you could fill a whole country
with the heads he's taken.
He's not feared just
because he's powerful.
The tales of his achievements
in battle go back 200 years.
That's why they call him
Nosferatu Zodd.
You have done well, boy,
to stand against me for this long.
So the swords alone are
evenly matched, huh?
I see..
You were aiming for my sword.
You're the first man to drive
their sword this deeply into me!
I am pleased.
To stand against an enemy like you...
is probably why I have survived
for these 300 years!
Impossible!
A monster like this exists?!
Fight me!
Do not disappoint me!
Is that all you've got?
No, I should say you have
done well for a human.
That's Zodd?!
Stay focused! Second volley!
Fire!
I won't have this!
No one shall defile this fight,
no matter who you are!
It's no use! Get out of here!
Casca, have everyone withdraw!
Griffith! Where is...?
Guts!
Idiot! What are you doing here?!
Save it for when we get away
from that monster.
Fight me!
Until you are shredded into pieces!
Oh, shit!
Griffith!
Can you move?
If I don't, we're dead.
Take the left.
Let's go!
Guts! We'll make a run for it!
Griffith!
To think I would meet two men
on the same day who can wound me...
and then have to lose them both.
No!
He is my...
my...
Farewell, human!
This is...?!
The Egg of the King?!
What is the Crimson Behelit doing here?
I see! So it's that kind of trick!
Boy, I will give you a warning.
No, a prophecy.
If you are a true friend to this man...
take heed.
When his ambition dies within him...
death will come to you!
A death you cannot escape!
What was that?!
A demon?
What was that?
Besides that...
A "true friend"?
I'm going to die?
I don't get it.
Just what's going on?
Griffith! Speak to me!
Are you all right'?!
Keep away!
It's your fault this happened to Griffith!
It's your fault!
Shit!
What the hell is she talking about?!
That bitch!
Don't be so upset.
You're hurt worse than I am.
You're tough.
Nosferatu Zodd?
A monster like that in this world?
That's serious.
If you look at it another way,
it might prove...
the existence of something
that we can't know.
Like God.
Wouldn't it be more like the Devil?
Isn't that the same thing?
While we're at it,
that thing around your neck...
When that monster saw it,
he took off.
What is it?
A Behelit. An old fortune teller
gave it to me once.
She said it's the destiny of one
who holds it to acquire the world
in exchange for
his ﬂesh and blood.
The world, huh?
That thing gives me the creeps!
Don't scare me like that.
It's neat, huh?
That part of you never changes, does it?
I'll never change.
So why?
I'm just a soldier, a subordinate at the very least.
Why did you save me?
No reason at all.
Do I need a reason every time
I put myself in harm's way for you?
It's just...
Have your wounds healed?
Sire!
Hey, Guts!
You are in the king's presence!
You're being disrespectful.
Never mind. Raise your heads.
Count Griffith, your Band of
the Hawk is doing magnificent work.
Thank you.
Sire, should you speak thusly
to one so new with us?
And why not?
Yes, there are some who do not think well
of these men of common birth.
But dignity and status do not win battles.
I have great hopes for you,
unfettered by tradition as you all are.
I am grateful for your kind words.
Who is that lady?
My daughter Charlotte.
She says she does not like warriors,
and rarely comes outside.
Charlotte...
She is my only child.
Perhaps I've spoilt her.
You must forgive me Count Griffith.
Come along, Charlotte.
Are you all right?
Excuse me.
Please be careful.
Um...
How dare you touch the princess!
Why, you old...
I apologize, Your Lordship General Julius.
As long as you understand, it's all right.
Princess, your father awaits.
Coming, Uncle!
Why are we wasting time with
these nobles and their sports?
It's stupid.
It's all part of the job.
And it beats being on a battlefield.
No arrows, no heads split open...
Using this thing suits me better.
There he goes...
bloodthirsty madman.
Not again, Corkus!
Shut up!
Standing guard at the hunt has
always been reserved for knights.
It's an honor!
This is what we've all fought for
in the mud of the battlefield!
And you're calling it stupid?!
Corkus!
If you want to wave around your sword,
go do it alone, you madman!
To each his own, I guess.
Well then, please excuse me.
You don't like to hunt?
Why do gentlemen enjoy bloodshed?
In war, and in hunting...
Oh, my!
Your Highness, like this...
General...
We'll wait for our chance.
It went that way!
After it!
Please! Stop!
It's all right now.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Are you hurt?
What's wrong?
I was so afraid!
My heart's pounding!
I've never...
You seem to be calming down.
Let's get back.
Everyone will be worried.
Griffith!
Griffith!
Guts...
Griffith!
Shit!
Griffith!
Princess!
What happened?
Where did the arrow come from?!
Ouch!
Griffith! Griffith!
Don't cry, Casca.
- Griffith!
- Griffith!
The arrow. Are you all right?
Don't touch it.
It's probably poisoned.
All the more reason...
No.
This shielded me.
The Egg of the King...
What?!
Incredible!
That's devil's luck!
I can't believe it!
That's not "luck."
It's a miracle!
I'll go search those bushes with some men.
Take off your armor.
We have to make sure you're not hurt.
This poison...
will cost someone...
You're kidding!
What?!
Look at you!
How can you hope to lead my White Dragon Knights
fighting like that?!
I've had enough!
F-Father! I can continue.
Let's see to that wound, Master Adonis.
Your father, in his youth, was the product
of very severe training.
Do not hold this against him.
Kill? Who?
The second in line to the throne.
The General of the White Dragons, Count Julius.
The poison on the arrow meant for me,
is one this royal house  used
for generations, for assassinations.
This will be dirty work.
One cannot fail.
Or be seen.
That is why I am asking you.
Will you do it?
This isn't like you.
Just give me an order like you always do.
Begging your pardon, Highness,
perhaps you are being a little
too rough on the young master?
Enough, Hassan!
Adonis cannot stay a child forever.
When he succeeds me, he must be ready.
But...
Enough! Withdraw!
Not only did I fail, but he's now
a hero for saving the Princess!
The wind?
Hey, Hassan!
An intruder?!
I know...you!
You're... Griffith's...!
Hey!
I heard something.
Someone's there!
An intruder!
Look!
Master Adonis!
To arms!
Intruder!
He should still be close!
Be careful!
Master Adonis, too! How brutal!
Find him! Don't let him escape alive!
There he is! He's on the west wall!
Cut him off there!
Fire!
I bet Griffith is eating better stuff
than this at the Princess's banquet.
Yeah, but with that bunch
he won't be able to relax.
So what?
He'll get to eat fine food,
and get lucky with some perfumed noble lady.
What's a little stress?
Get lucky with a noble lady at
Princess Charlotte's banquet?
I doubt that.
Where's Guts?
I haven't seen him all day.
He's probably off practicing again.
That bloodthirsty madman.
Another, Pippin...
He was supposed to train with
my unit today.
But he didn't show up.
Without a word.
There he is!
Guts!
Where have you been all day?
Where's Griffith?
Princess Charlotte invited him...
to her banquet.
He should be at Promrose Hall...
see.
Hey! I'm not done talking to you!
Guts!
An arrow wound?
What a nice breeze!
I've never grown accustomed to
events like this.
I'm a bit tired.
Please, Princess Charlotte...
Oh, my!
Thank you.
Wait.
You're going in like that?
Don't embarrass Griffith.
Wait until they're finished talking.
Give me this.
Hey...
I remember you asked me why men are so fond...
of bloodshed.
Yes.
It's true it might simply be
a barbaric side to their nature.
But that allows men to preserve
something that is dear to their hearts.
It's a sword that cuts both ways.
"Dear to their hearts"?
Like a lover?
I meant...something like honor?
Both are important.
A true knight fights and dies
for both love and honor.
But a man should encounter
one more thing
that is dear to him.
One more thing?
A dream he must realize for
himself and himself alone.
A dream?
No matter who you are,
it's a dream that sets you on fire.
It's a dream that sustains you,
oppresses you, keeps you alive...
and then kills you.
Even after the dream abandons you,
it still smoulders in your heart.
At least once,
a man should have a vision of that life...
as a martyr to the god named Dream.
To simply live a life because
one was born into it...
I can't accept that.
I'm sorry. This must be such
a boring topic for a lady.
Not at all!
You're...
a very mysterious gentleman.
You're nobler than any nobleman.
But when you showed me how
to play the leaf whistle,
you were like a child playing in the fields.
And now you're like a philosopher.
I'm sure...
this charm is what attracted
your friends to you.
They are precious comrades who
have faced death with me many times.
But they are not friends.
A friend is someone who does not
cling to another's dream.
He decides his own,
and he will stand against anyone
who dares to trample
on it with his body and soul.
Even if that person is me.
A friend to me, is an equal.
Lord Griffith, so what is this dream of yours?
Princess!
What is it?
I-It's terrible!
Your Uncle Count Julius, has died!
What did you say?
It was an assassination!
Someone crept into his home
and murdered him!
His son Master Adonis, too!
The castle's in an uproar!
The banquet has been cancelled.
His Majesty orders you to return home at once!
Your escort is coming.
Please prepare to depart!
Come on. There'll be war if
this is Chuder's handiwork.
Guts?
There's no time to think.
How to fight, how to kill...
That's all there is.
I wanted to be his sword!
It's just a castle that's a little bit bigger.
So what?
Just do what Griffith says,
and it will be ours.
Risk your life!
That's the only way you'll survive!
If we survive, we win!
I just wanted to see what Griffith
and the Band of the Hawk were up to.
Who they brought with them
and what else they were after.
