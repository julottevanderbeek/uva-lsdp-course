The Holy Land 1177
War raged between Christian and Muslim
over the city that was sacred to them all:
Jerusalem.
Attacks and robberies made it dangerous
to travel in the inhospitable country.
In order to protect travellers and pilgrims
the Christian church sent its most
feared warriors: the Knights Templar.
For some, these knights were
God's blessed soldiers;
for others, they were
the Devil's evil demons.
That's him.
The devil with the red cross: Al Ghouti.
Why is he helping us?
Al Ghouti.
Arn.
Arn.
Many years earlier,
in the frozen north
the boy Arn Magnusson grew up.
His fate was to be significant
to many people's life and death.
Arn, where are you?
This isn't fun anymore.
Arn, come out now.
You are dead.
What are you doing out here alone?
This is no place for youngsters.
Arn was born on the farm Arnäs
in Västra Götaland,
a small divided kingdom in which three
powerful clans fought over the crown.
Arn's parents, who belonged
to the Folkunga clan,
had long managed to keep the peace
with their neighbours.
Have you seen the boys?
- No, Madame Sigrid.
Fetch Master Magnus. His brother is here.
I found these two north of the stream.
- Have you taken leave of your senses?
What were you thinking of?
How many times must I tell you?
Never alone in the forest - never!
- No.
So, inside with you both now.
Birger!
- Magnus!
What brings you here, brother?
- The King is on his way.
King Erik Jedvardsson rode round his land
in order to strengthen his power
against his most dangerous enemy,
the Sverker clan.
Near Arnäs, he had built a church
that was now to be consecrated in his name.
I'm talking about consolidating our long
friendship and the church's holy realm.
Do I have your support, Folkunga people?
Or must I leave this house your enemy?
Knut! Take that cursed bird
of ill fortune outside!
Choosing the right side could be crucial.
The king's son, Knut, knew from his father
that those who fought for the crown
could win a great deal, but just as easily lose everything.
Are you also going to be king
when you grow up?
Father says so. He says
that God has decreed it.
He says that my son will be king.
And my grandson,
and my great grandson...
- ...and your great great great
great great grandson.
Can I hold him?
Sorry.
It's doesn't matter.
He always comes back.
The Folkunga clan decided to
support King Erik Jedvardsson
in his consecration of the church.
A house of God, but
built on Sverker land.
Sverkers - in the forest.
How dare you - before God's house?
No.
Listen to me, Folkungar.
Right now there is only one rightful king
in Västra Götaland.
And I am he: Karl Sverkersson.
Who is he?
Is that his son?
No, he is with me.
Knut is not safe here. I will take him
to friends in Norway.
The sword had been unsheathed
and the people of Västra Götaland turned,
trembling, to prayer to God,
for only he could know
what the future would bring
and who would be friend or foe.
At Arnäs, they prepared for uncertain times,
and Arn would soon find out what
God had in store for him and his family.
Will there be war now?
- No, you don't have to worry
We have a new king, that's all.
That's the way it is.
Where is Knut?
He is in Norway.
But isn't Knut going to be king?
With God's help, they'll retake the throne.
So we have to be patient.
No, Ingmar. They go to the forge.
Arn! Come!
Look!
- It's Knut's bird.
No, Arn! You're not allowed up there.
You are not allowed!
Arn!
Mother. Mother!
Mother, come!
Arn, can you hear me?
What happened?
- I said that he shouldn't go up there.
We must not give up hope, Magnus.
Come.
Dear God,
give Arn back his life.
If you let him live,
we promise to repay it.
We promise that we shall give him
to your holy work.
We give you our promise, God.
He will be your servant on earth.
God,
we give you our promise.
God, we give you our promise.
We give you our promise.
Magnus.
Our prayers have been heard.
Listen here. I have made up my mind.
- No, you can't mean it.
He's just a child.
We promised, Magnus
No, Sigrid. I will not send
my boy to a monastery.
Do you think I want this?.
- You can't mean it.
I have put it off, doubted.
I can't close my eyes to my sin anymore.
- He's just a child.
We promised, Magnus.
We promised God that, if he let Arn live,
we would give him to His holy work.
God has a purpose for Arn.
For something so great, we
should not stand in the way.
It is God's punishment, Magnus. We have failed him.
This is how He reminds us.
We must keep our promise.
I will take him to Varnhems monastery.
Pater Henri.
Pater...
I need your help.
- What is it, my daughter?
We have an extra blanket
for him if he gets cold, do we?
Where is mother?
We'll do all we can for her.
The boy.
Brother Lucien has examined the mother.
The sores on her face are quite consistent
with swine fever. That we can cure.
Her arm... it's blood poisoning.
There's only one cure for that.
- It has to be... removed?
The mother refuses.
She says it is the will of God.
She and her husband promised the child
to God. The promise is a sacred trust.
We cannot oppose the will of God.
But I am reluctant to raise
a child to become a monk.
To become one of us must be a free choice.
Father Henri has promised that
you can stay here.
It is God's will, Arn.
Do you understand that?
Will you stay here too, mother?
Be obedient, and do as you are told.
There you have it.
Do you promise me that?
Do you want to try?
Want to try? Hmmm?
OK?
Here...
Hold it tight.
And now, aim...
and now try to hit the target.
Very good!
Good. Again.
Good. Again.
Very good! Hup!
Hey look!
I told you, always in my eyes.
Vocat.
- Vocat.
Vocamus.
- Vocamus.
Scribo.
- Scribo.
Scribis.
- Scribis.
Arn.
Arn, wake up.
Come.
'Thou hast ravaged my heart, my sister, my spouse;
Thou hast ravaged my heart
with one of thine eyes,
with one chain of thy neck.
The Song of Solomon is the most beautiful
text about love ever written.
You'll understand that one day.
But how can you win someone's heart?
It is figuratively meant, Arn.
'Alloy est omnis
scientiae fundamentum '.
Write it.
'To read is the foundation of all knowledge'.
What?
In which hand does it feel most comfortable?
Both.
Again.
You seem to be training him to be a warrior.
Is that entirely wise?
I am merely strengthening the skills
that God has already given him.
You have a new friend. Look.
What a beautiful horse!
What kind of horse is that?
Well, he belongs to the noblest, the fastest,
the most resilient breed there is.
They are war horses.
- Where is he from?
The Holy Land.
Can you speak to him?
- I can speak to desert horses.
I think he likes you.
Tell him that I like him too.
What's his name?
Chamsiin.
- Chamsiin.
It means "Desert Wind".
D'you want to ride him?
Good. Can you feel the strength of the horse?
Good!
Help me. I don't want to!
- Where is she?
There, Gunnar - look.
- I pray you, help me.
Come, Gunnar, come!
- I do not want him.
Sinner!
- There she is!
Bride abduction!
No, no! Let go of me!
You thought you could take my bride?
- Leave him be!
He's just as innocent as you,
running away from the wedding.
Do what you must, brother.
God, bear in mind...
it's only a boy monk.
Take it, boy.
Take it.
Take it up.
Take it, then.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
I have committed the gravest of sins.
I've killed two men.
That is the end of your confession,
my son?
All thy sins I thee forgive.
Ego te absolvo.
In the name of the Father, and of
the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
I do not understand.
- Sit.
You killed those men in self-defence.
They were sinners trying to
force that poor girl to marry against her will.
It may not have been a miracle,
as that simple-minded priest said,
but who, if not God, was it
that put them in your way?
Arn, it was your mother's will,
and God's, that you be raised here in this monastery;
well, now you are grown up, and
you must do the Lord's calling.
Broder Guilbert and I have discussed this,
and we have reached a decision.
The time has come for you to go home, Arn.
You must go back to your family.
'In hoc signo vinces.'
'In this sign thou shalt conquer'.
Before I came here,
to this peaceful monastery,
I served another order:
God's Holy Army, the Knights Templar.
For 12 years, I fought with this sword
in the Holy Land.
With this sword no-one has ever defeated me.
You may never draw it in anger
or use it for your own gain.
It has to serve God's good cause.
Cecilia.
You let your animals graze my land?
Don't you know where the boundaries are?
Yes, I know where they go.
- It's not your land.
Have you no honour in your body?
You stand there and lie to my face?
That land has always belonged to the Folkunga clan.
Yeah, there are more than just me that can confirm it.
- Then we shall see what the council has to say.
See you, liar.
And who are you?
Eskil.
Father.
Arn.
Well I'll be...
I didn't recognise you.
I thought I had lost you
to the monks.
It's good to have you back.
"Then fetch the steer instead," she said.
- To him?
Arn, my boy. Stand up.
You are Folkunga now.
Bear it it with pride.
Who was the man that was here?
Emund Ulvbane.
- You know the snake...
that shot King Erik with an arrow?
Now, he claims that we have
taken land that belongs to him.
We'll sort it all out at the council.
Axevalla Council.
There is much that is new to you now.
Magnus.
- Brose.
Arn. I am happy that you
have returned to Arnäs.
You haven't changed, Brose.
- You've had a few years in the monks' cells.
Have you learned to read?
Hmmmm, so you can read now.
Is Knut here, too?
-No, no. He is still in Norway. It's best that way.
He knows that time is on his side.
When it comes to the dispute with Ulvbane,
then we shall have to give him silver.
Although we have truth on our side,
we have to buy time.
I thought to propose a settlement.
What worries me is that Ulvbane
is so close to the Sverker clan.
A troubled king is an erratic king.
We are gathered here in Axevalla,
to hold Council.
We come in peace, and we go in peace.
Those who violate the peace of Council,
shall be seen as a villain.
This council is now open.
The next issue is the land dispute between
Magnus Folkesson and Emund Ulvbane.
As I have understood it,
Magnus Folkesson is prepared to settle.
That is correct.
I am prepared to buy out Emund Ulvbane
for thirty pieces of silver.
That is more than any man can demand,
for peace between  neighbours
is worth more than silver.
This settlement is satisfactory?
As the Council has judged,
so must I accept.
But it is troublesome that silver
takes precedence over honour and justice.
It troubles me to have to settle
with a man without honour.
You, Magnus Folkesson,
you are no man.
And your sons are no better.
Two sons of a bitch, one a nun
and the other a beer barrel.
Sverkersson has planned this, and words of conflict
have been whispered in Ulvbanes ear more than once.
He knew exactly what to say, word for word.
Sverkersson wants to weaken us.
He knows that Knut might come back from Norway
and fears that he will take the crown with our help.
I wish there were a loophole,
but given the insults between you,
the law demands a duel.
Is there no other way?
Surely there must be another way.
- I shall meet him tomorrow.
May God help me.
Don't despair,
I am not buried yet.
Let the combatants come forward.
It's too late.
He has accepted the challenge.
Shall I fight a nun?
I didn't think your father was such a weakling.
Kill the Sverker.
- Chop him up him, Arn.
Finish him.
Kill! Kill!
Welcome, Magnus.
News of Axevalla precedes you.
Thank you for letting us rest here tonight.
I see we have a new face here.
- Yes, it is Arn.
Arn! The last time I saw you, you were a toddler.
Now it's you everyone is talking about.
You must be a proud father, Magnus.
You think I'm ugly?
- No.
Give my regards to mother.
- Don't be sad, Katarina.
Soon, it will be my turn again.
Welcome home, Cecilia.
- Thank you.
How was Katarina?
She was so sad when she left for the abbey.
That's the way it always is
when it is her turn to be there.
I promised that we would visit her.
- That can be arranged.
Cecilia.
- Yes, mother.
Arn. Algot Pålsson is here.
He has his daughter with him.
It isn't Katarina.
It's Cecilia.
Welcome, Algot.
What brings you here?
We were in these parts, so...
I just wanted to see what it was like.
It's been a long time since I was here.
Father does not like when I ride alone,
that's why we have the groom for company.
You have met my sister?
- What?
Katarina. You've met her, haven't you?
Katarina, yes.
So what did you think of her?
- You are not very alike. I mean...
You are quite different.
- You think so?
What a beautiful horse you have.
Come.
Catch me if you can.
We nealry lost him.
- Miss Cecilia?
Meet me here at dusk.
Cecilia?
Come now.
Cecilia!
Arn...
Stop!
"Thou hast ra...
What did you say?
What did you say?
"Thou hast ravanged my heart,
my sister, my bride.
Thou hast ravanged my heart
with one of thine eyes."
I think you have ravaged my...
Arn Magnusson.
Don't you greet people?
Do we know each other?
It was my jackdaw's fault
that you ended up in the monastery.
