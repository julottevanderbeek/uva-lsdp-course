Cologne 1925
It's cold.
Lotte, Lotte, Lotte.
The Twins
Catch it, Anna.
~ Dear little sister, dance with me
~ Take both your little hands
~ One time back, one time forth
~ Turn around and then it's done
~ Now give me your right hand
~ And we dance very gallantly
~ One, two, three, quick on your feet
~ Cheerfully we dance around each other
It's time.
You have no right. I am
a cousin. You have absolutely no right.
I'm family too, aren't I?
They're better off with us.
-
- I'm not trying to be difficult, but...
So many nice things.
Music, a big house...
Aren't we good enough?
Not posh enough? Are you any better?
They will have
every opportunity with us.
Be honest. I'm not saying that
we're any better than you, but really...
... in Thee find eternal happiness.
Lord, grant the deceased eternal peace.
Let perpetual light shine on him.
Lord, grant him eternal rest. Amen.
You can have the sick one.
Just the sick one. Final offer.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust, in sure and certain hope
of the Resurrection.
It's a disgrace.
Twins belong together.
Be quiet, Ferdinand. We'll go along with it.
Everyone will get something.
Let me go!
Anna!
Lotte!
Anna!
- Anna!
- Lotte!
- Bonjour, Madame.
- Bonjour.
Not bad, eh, Jet?
It turns with the sun.
No Swiss sanatorium could match it.
For you.
For you.
We're going to get Lotte well again.
Lotte is going to be well cared for
in her new country.
Go on.
Come.
- When is Lotte coming?
- When you've finished.
Start at the front.
Not all in one go.
Lotte won't be coming.
She has consumption. So that's that.
Look, this is my mummy.
She's not alive anymore.
Just like your mummy.
And now I'm your new mummy.
Give me that handkerchief.
You know these words, don't you?
Handkerchief? Mummy?
Say "mummy".
They are Dutch words. Say it.
Dear Lotte, when are you coming?
- What are you writing?
- A letter.
- To whom?
- Lotte.
- And where will you send it to?
- Holland.
Do you know the address?
- She thinks we know the address.
-
No, no, no.
We don't have the address either.
They don't want us to know it.
Afraid we'll drop by.
Stuck-up lot.
Maybe Lotte will write to you.
If she's still alive.
Dear Anna.
Tomorrow I will get on the train
and come to you.
Tomorrow I will be with you again.
You'll never guess
what delicious things I have.
That's good.
Write a nice letter to your sister.
Later. After your meal.
Dinand? We have to decide now.
Do we send it?
And then?
She'll want to go there
when she's better.
And then they'll keep her.
- I can't bear to see it.
- They're barbarians, Jetje.
Stupid farmers.
Stupid, Catholic farmers.
Do you want her to grow up there?
No.
She has to forget Anna.
Believe me, Jetje.
For her own good.
She simply has to forget Anna.
Why is there no letter?
- Harder.
- No.
- Because there won't be a letter.
- Why not?
- I'll tell you some day. Go on.
- No.
Lotte doesn't want anything to do with you.
She thinks you're stupid and dirty.
And besides, she's dead.
Ach!
Anna! Anna!
- Anna!
- Sweetie...
Did something make you
call out for Anna?
Shall I tell you about Anna?
You understand me perfectly,
don't you? Clever little girl.
Anna is living with the barbarians.
They are really stupid people
who have no stationery.
And that's why there is never a letter.
But not to worry.
Anna is very happy with the barbarians.
She likes it there.
With all the animals.
And she wants Lotte to be happy, too.
Anna doesn't want Lotte to cry.
You have to go to sleep now.
Sleep well.
Sleep well.
- Is she getting milk?
- The milk is to sell.
And why don't I see her in school?
Really?
She doesn't seem that way to me.
In fact, she seems rather clever.
Anna.
What is it?
"The grace of help
is a supernatural assistance
through which God lightens
our understanding and moves us
to shun evil and do good."
- I want to go to school.
- You're coming with me.
-  Why are you here?
- My hands, you see.
I don't play the piano anymore.
- Both hands?
- Only the right. Arm and hand.
I have everything low in the kitchen.
But other than that...
Bonjour, Madame.
We just have to make the best of it.
I'll see you tomorrow.
What's wrong with you?
- Arthritis?
- Yes.
Me, too. I have that, too.
- It runs in our family.
- Oh, well. Not in mine.
Yes, it does.
It does.
It certainly does.
Lotte.
Anna?
Yes.
Why are you looking
in the mirror?
Your father had consumption.
So did your sister.
And your mother had cancer.
But I'm still alive.
~ He, the most splendid of all
~ So gentle and so kind
~ Beautiful lips
Our Lot has been on the radio
twice already.
With a choir.
~ Purposeful and determined
~ Like there in the blue depths
~ Bright and shiny, that star
~ So he is in my heaven
- It's not about you, you know.
- Sing, sing.
Here comes Schumann.
Third year, conservatory.
I'm a rotten player. Go on.
-  The farmer who marries you...
- Does not exist.
- Oh no?
- No.
I won't marry a farmer.
I won't be a farmer's wife.
You have a beautiful voice.
Are you coming to the conservatory?
No, I'm going to study German.
Pity. Why? Why German?
I think German is a beautiful language.
Are you the milkman's?
You don't look like your sisters at all.
Yet they're sisters all the same.
Imagine.
You're much more beautiful.
Please.
- The axle of our hay cart. Is it ready?
- Not yet.
What are you doing?
- He looks like he wants to fight.
- He does.
Fight for us. For all of us.
Against unemployment
and against poverty.
That man has big plans for us.
It's incredible
that this Hitler, this mudslinger,
is so successful.
Germany, Germany...
It's in the papers every day.
I'm sick of it.
Our Bram has just returned
from Germany.
- Oh really?
- Yes.
A born raconteur, my brother.
They said that you had to go to Germany
for proper training in violin making.
And?
He was back after fourteen days,
devastated.
Why?
Oh, I don't know...
I can listen to him for hours.
- Tell us, go on.
- It's just not easy to get a position there.
For Jews, he means. He was given
the cold shoulder everywhere he went.
We're no longer welcome there.
Oh, you shouldn't take those Nazis
too seriously, you know.
We belong to the first class.
Did you know that?
Farmers belong to the first class.
If he succeeds, everything will be better.
Then you can take on a workman
and I can go to school.
- Who gave you this paper?
- Bernd Möller. He told me all this.
Bernd Möller is an idiot.
We are Catholics.
Adolf Hitler is fighting for us.
It says so there.
You'll get a workman, I'll go to school.
- Never let me catch you near that boy.
- Why? I only want to go to school.
Never let me catch you
near that bastard, you hear me?
So that's how they do it.
Enlisting young people.
Idiots. Bunch of sheep!
And you're falling for this as well!
Never again, do you hear?
If I ever catch you near that stupid ass...
Let them talk, ignorant farmers.
Your uncle is an ignorant farmer.
Obedient Catholics.
They don't know any better.
Like animals who have lived too long in a
cage. Open the door and they stay inside.
What has the Church ever done for us?
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life in filth?
We'll do it differently.
If there were more women like you,
we'd have the new Germany in no time.
You sit here.
-  Well, what do you think?
- Nice.
I've joined, Anna.
A new order, and I'm part of it.
- You should join as well.
- Yes.
Do you want to make me happy?
- And Germany? And our Fuhrer?
- I want to go to grammar school.
I'll build you a house.
With a gable roof. And shutters.
A Bavarian veranda.
And a solid oak door.
I have to go home. They don't know
where I am. And there's a storm coming.
Heinrich, come here!
Anna kissed him.
Would you have dared
if your father were still alive?
Would you?
Would you have dared if your father
were still alive? Come here, you!
Come here!
What's wrong?
Anna.
Separating twins - what an idea.
It's just criminal.
I've written so many letters.
Sitting up in my bed.
"Anna, where are you? Anna, write back.
Anna, Anna, Anna."
But she never replied.
I talked to her in my head.
They thought I was a quiet child,
but I was talking all day.
- Like this I can see both of you.
- Don't.
But which one is Anna?
Why don't you visit her?
She never gave me a sign
she was alive.
Shall I go with you? I'll go with you.
David, you cannot talk about this.
- We never talk about it at home.
- Why not?
I told you. Now you must forget it again.
Anna.
That does it.
I'm taking you away from here.
~ Dear little sister, dance with me
~ Take both your little hands
~ One time back, one time forth
That cupboard
on Monday morning, I told you.
The outside only.
- And the floor?
- I wanted to do that later.
Come here, girl.
I check everything myself, like this.
There can be no dust,
no dirt anywhere.
No rest until all the dirt is gone.
It's a struggle.
Dust plagues our lives.
Don't forget the portrait of our Fuhrer.
~ Now give me your right hand
~ And we dance very gallantly
~ One, two, three, quick on your feet
~ Cheerfully we dance around each other
- I can't find it. Schumann.
- Higher, I think.
Oh, Schumann! Schumann!
Schu-Schu-Schu-Schu-Schumann!
That's not very gentlemanly.
No, it's not.
What is that?
It's cruel.
All those letters.
My sister.
How could you?
Something so terrible.
You don't know
what you're talking about.
Where are her letters?
Or did you throw them away?
- No, darling. No.
- Give me those letters then.
No letter ever came.
Why not?
Did she know where I lived?
All that time she was waiting
for a letter from me?
Who would do such a thing?
Why? Explain it to me!
We saved you
from a bunch of illiterate barbarians.
Why didn't you save her then?
You were sick. And if you had visited Anna,
they would have kept you there.
- Your life wouldn't have been as nice!
- I would have still had my sister!
You would now both be marching
behind Mr. Hitler, waving flags!
Does she still live there?
With the barbarians?
Why?
Because I'm going to her.
Good day, madam.
Hereditary Health Department.
Could we have a word?
According to our information,
you have a servant called Anna Bamberg.
May we come in?
What about Anna Bamberg?
As you know,
Anna Bamberg is mentally retarded.
- She looks quite normal, I thought.
- Yes, yes. That's not unusual.
But these papers leave no doubts.
What do you want from her?
You know the government is looking
to solve the problem of retarded people?
I don't understand.
It has been decided
that Anna Bamberg is to be sterilized.
Sterilized?
Such things are hereditary, madam.
Surely you know that.
Anna Bamberg, retarded?
It's right here
in the guardianship deed.
"Anna Bamberg, foster daughter
of Heinrich and Martha, is retarded
and too delicate of health
to be educated."
"She is so weak..."
That they had to keep her home
from school. And so on.
Read for yourself.
He was paid?
She's right in front of you,
Anna Bamberg.
I'm that delicate, retarded girl.
I could read and write
when I was six years old.
My uncle kept me home
to work for him for free.
He allowed his wife to terrorize me,
he beat me up. And no one...
No one ever came to check
whether what he'd written was true.
And now you're going to sterilize me?
I've had quite enough of this. Out.
- Excuse us.
- Get out!
Don't you worry.
I won't break any more of your vases.
You know what your problem is?
You have ideas above your station.
- Good luck.
- You're a servant and you always will be.
Anna!
My dear sister.
This is my first letter to you,
but also my hundredth.
I'm writing this with thumping heart,
because I think, dear Anna,
that we will see each other again soon.
I have found you.
So you're still alive. Lotte...
What a surprise. I've asked myself
so often why you didn't write.
We were both lied to.
Your letter took five weeks to get here.
Dear Anna, do you know
where you're going yet?
I'm tutoring in German. I have nearly
enough for the trip. Will you write to me?
Dear Lotte. Your fetter
came yesterday, after eight weeks.
It was opened at Customs.
I have a new position,
near Cologne, with a countess.
We live in a villa with a swimming pool.
Can you imagine?
The countess is beautiful. And she smells
so nice, of powder and cigarettes.
Are you coming soon?
I've gone ahead and bought one.
Lotte!
Anna.
Do you remember me?
Everything-
Your eyebrows... Everything.
Your eyes.
Daddy's eyes.
This car belongs to the countess.
Everyone else's cars
are commandeered.
- Nice car.
- Mm-hm.
You can only stay one night.
I couldn't reach you.
Everything has changed again.
We're heading east.
The countess is afraid.
Afraid that the English
will start bombing us.
Thank you, Gunther.
There she is. Charlotte von Garlitz
Dublow, Countess of Falkenau.
They have an old castle on the Oder.
That's where we're going.
Beautiful, isn't she?
- Is this all right?
- Yes.
Yes.
When do you have to leave?
Tomorrow morning.
The countess can't do without me.
- Tomorrow?
- Yes. Pity. The war...
I have to go downstairs.
What about me?
Can I come? I'll help you.
Why not? You'll find out
what a proper maid's life is like.
You're like a board.
As straight as an arrow.
- Thanks.
- Not too tight?
- Why are they here?
- They're on leave. Guests of the count.
Come on.
I don't know what it's like there
or how long we'll stay.
It's mad. We're taking everything with us.
The whole family is dining here.
Plus spouses and children.
The officers, the guests...
Let me think. Who is sewing?
- We used to have the same glasses.
- Hannele and I. And Lotte.
Hermann will pour the wine.
Did we have crystal?
No, in Holland.
At my mother and father's house.
Anna, the silverware. We can't find it.
Has it been packed?
Madam, this is my sister.
Not now, darling.
Silverware. Come, rescue me.
What's it like, university?
Oh, nice.
But I don't study enough.
I much prefer singing.
I've got an accompanist
at the moment.
I can play, but he's much better.
Do you still play the piano?
A... very nice boy.
Do you want to know a secret?
We're going to get engaged.
Anna, dear Anna.
What would I do without you?
Engaged? Really? Tell me about it.
When are you finished?
Is it the champagne,
or are there more maids here?
~ Jews live shamelessly
in our German fatherland
~ Soldiers, comrades,
put the Jews against the wall
~ When the soldier goes into battle
he is in high spirits
~ With the Jew's blood dripping
from his knife, things look even better
~ For we are going into battle
~ For we are going into battle
~ Against England, England
Our side has suffered the first casualty!
This is the hardest I've ever worked.
Do you want to stay here?
Why?
You can come with me to Holland.
There is no war there.
And I'm sure my... mother
would be pleased.
Go with you to Holland?
I don't have anything for you.
That many?
You don't have to read them now.
Silly children's letters.
If I had received all those letters...
Remember this?
Mum's.
Now you can have it for a while.
- She couldn't embroider.
-
What are they doing?
- Why are they doing that?
- They've gone mad.
Anna, you have to leave.
You can't stay here.
Come with me.
Come with me to Holland.
Please.
Why not?
I can't abandon the countess right now.
She was so kind to me.
Two weeks. Three, at the most.
Until we settle in there. Then I'll come.
Two weeks...
I don't understand.
I couldn't stick it here for another day.
Until we've settled in.
Then I'll come.
Why can't you decide for yourself?
Forty-five rooms.
She doesn't know what to do.
It's not up to that woman.
It's your life.
Three weeks.
Then I'll come. I promise.
I want to meet everybody.
Your sisters. Your fiancé.
Want to see him?
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing. He's handsome.
- What was it?
- For a moment I thought he was a Jew.
Madam?
If you want me to take you to the station,
you'd better come now.
Safe journey.
See you soon.
Bye.
Bye, Lotte.
Bye, Lotte.
Bye.
Anna.
Everyone is waiting for you.
Lotte.
Lotte?
Lotte!
Lotte!
Lotte!
Lotte!
Lotte.
Lotte, come.
Please, Lotte. Come.
This endless running... I'm old.
Then don't.
I didn't ask you to run after me.
- I'm your sister. I'm alive, I exist.
- I didn't ask you for anything.
- I've looked for you, I've telephoned.
- Telephoned?
Yes, telephoned. I asked for you.
And then she doesn't know who I am.
- Who?
- Your daughter.
- Did you call Hester?
- Yes.
I said: Anna. Nothing. Anna Grosalie.
Nothing. Anna Bamberg. Nothing.
- She must have thought I was crazy.
- Bother my daughter? How dare you?
All this time you pretended
that I didn't exist.
But I'm alive,
and I want to talk to you.
Why are you bothering me?
You were gone. Why didn't you stay away?
Why didn't you tell anyone about me?
What should I have told my children?
Were you ashamed of me?
- I'll walk with you and we will talk.
- I don't want to talk.
Then I'll talk.
I can't hear anything.
My God, what a pigsty.
Forty-five rooms.
You have to help me.
The emperor Wilhelm slept here.
You can still smell him.
Stuffy and sour.
I'd like to go to Holland in two weeks,
to visit my sister. Is that all right?
Of course not.
The rooms, I don't know where
everything is. The linen and suchlike.
But after that
I want to go to visit my sister.
Darling, that's impossible. Then we have to
get the cellars ready for the Poles.
- Which Poles?
- Forced labor.
Coming to replace our workers,
who have to fight in Poland. Funny, isn't it?
She's an anti-Semite.
Don't be silly. Just because
she thought I was a Jew?
Yes.
You want to know something? I am a Jew.
I look like three Jews put together.
So bring your sister over.
I won't have anything to do
with that whole German thing.
And I'm giving up my studies, too.
Considering the circumstances,
I think it's better if you don't come here.
Your country is at war. Better not.
Anna! Anna.
We're going. Are you coming?
Something wrong with your sister?
I have no sister.
Do you want to dance?
Are you all right?
- Come, drink.
- No, no.
How about you?
I'm so hot, so terribly hot.
Are my cheeks really red?
Will you be staying long?
Yes.
Come.
Why does she say that? "Better not."
Better for whom?
- Who said that?
- Lotte.
- First I had to come, and now I can't.
- Lotte. Is that the fat woman?
- My sister in Holland. The letter.
- Oh, your sister.
- Why not, all of a sudden?
- Why not what?
What have I done wrong?
I only want to go to her.
To Holland?
- We're twin sisters.
- Yes, twins.
We had one of those in Czechoslovakia.
A non-commissioned artillery officer.
I won't write back. "Better not."
I've done without her all my life.
Seriously?
You were in Czechoslovakia?
Do you look alike?
My sister knows all about music.
She's a wonderful singer. Songs by...
I don't know who.
With a pianist, that's her fiancé.
Can you sing?
Me neither.
She studies at a university.
German. My sister.
She teaches, too. Speaks really good
German, better than me. So clever...
With such a nose.
And her eyes...
- The way she sometimes looks...
- What way is that?
Exactly like our father.
Then she doesn't need to say anything.
Neither of us says anything.
I could see her thinking. And looking.
Why would she do that?
It's clean.
She's German herself.
What a nice handkerchief.
It's good that you've got
a handkerchief like that with you.
- Maybe she thinks I'm stupid.
- Stupid? You?
Impossible. Out of the question.
I'm on to you, you Ostmarker.
Or should I say Austrian?
Since you're with us now.
Now it's dirty.
Why don't you lie down for a while?
Austrians. They're those
operetta soldiers, aren't they?
With roses in their rifles.
I'm a conscript.
If I had a choice,
I'd be at home in Vienna.
With a rose in my rifle.
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Good?
- Yes.
Anna.
What's this I hear?
What have you done?
Did you lend the beet press
to the Poles?
Otherwise they have to do it by hand.
Silly goose. You don't think
they'd do the same for us, do you?
- They hate us.
- But we don't hate them.
They are subhuman.
We are the master race.
Shouldn't we lend them the beet press,
if we are the master race?
Go ahead, then. You do
what you want anyway. Bolshevik.
Anna. Anna.
- Come.
- What is it?
Listen carefully.
I wanted to see you.
I'm not allowed to leave the barracks,
so I climbed over the wall.
- It's a secret. We're marching off.
- Where to?
I don't have time. I have to go back.
If they find out...
I just wanted to see you.
Where to?
I have to go back.
All leave has been canceled.
We're off, Anna. Oh, my dearest.
I'll write.
Will you wait for me?
When are you coming back?
Why has all leave
suddenly been canceled?
My people.
Despite having maintained strict
neutrality during the past months,
our country was attacked last night,
suddenly and without warning,
by the German Wehrmacht,
despite their solemn promise
that our neutrality would be respected
as long as we maintained it ourselves.
Who do they think they are?
Bloody Huns.
Let's go.
- To do what?
- Sailing.
Today? It's war.
- People are advised not to go out.
- We're going anyway.
Lotte, hold on. Stop.
We said we would wait.
- First we get married. That's the deal.
- I don't want to wait any longer.
Stop. Why don't you want to wait?
David!
- You're mad.
- No, I'm very serious.
- We could be dead tomorrow.
- Seriously.
I don't know. Forget it.
Forget everything.
Forget me. What does it matter?
- What's wrong with you?
- And we're not getting married either.
Don't be stupid.
Here.
I'm breaking it off. Take it.
OK?
Then don't. All the same to me.
- Can we go back?
- No.
Come on, I want to go now.
- Go on, then.
- Come.
Don't forget the peak halyard.
David, come on.
No.
- I'm going.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
What's the matter, silly rabbit?
- Why don't you break it off?
- Why should I?
Because I'm German, of course.
I'm German.
You know how it is. All those refugees...
The way Germans think about Jews...
- And now they're here.
-
It's war.
I'm German, and you'll hate me.
To me you're Lotte.
The girl I love so much.
The girl who sings so beautifully.
My bunny rabbit.
- Who is German.
- And who thinks she can sail.
We're Lotte and David,
and politics have nothing to do with it.
-
- Lotte, don't.
I've come for Martin Grosalie.
His training is done. He has leave today.
Leave has been canceled.
What?
- They're being punished.
- What for?
They were almost done.
All they had to do was shout "Sieg Heil".
Brand-new SS officers.
Shouldn't be a problem.
The commanding officer didn't think
it sounded enthusiastic enough.
Do you understand?
Poland, Russia. Fighting, fighting...
He's been trying to get leave
for two years. He must have it now.
It was the only reason
he wanted to do this stupid training.
Do you think he really wanted
to be an officer?
He doesn't give a damn
about the whole war.
- Sieg...
-  Heil!
- Sieg...
- Heil!
- Sieg...
- Heil!
- Sieg...
- Heil!
At least you can't throw that one
in the water.
David, I want to become a Jew.
- Yeah, right.
- I'm serious.
- I want to convert.
- You'd be mad.
Why? Because of the situation?
No, because of all the fuss.
My silly rabbit.
My bag. I forgot my bag.
- Where?
- In the cafe. The train tickets, everything.
- You'll never make it. Seven minutes.
- Easily.
David!
- I'm your silly rabbit.
- And don't you forget it.
I'm sorry.
Buchenwald?
Buchenwald, Buchenwald.
- What is there, Buchenwald?
- A sort of work camp, for young men.
"I'm doing fine.
We're working hard. David."
In German.
What is the charge? Is there a charge?
No, no. We think the Germans
wanted to set an example.
After the strike in Amsterdam.
"Watch out, don't make trouble."
He's not so badly off there.
He's healthy. He's always practiced sports.
It could easily
last a few months, though.
Strange how things go, isn't it?
If you hadn't forgotten your bag...
Shall I make tea?
Please forgive me, Anna,
for not contacting you for so long.
We're all confused here.
But I think about you a lot,
and I need you.
I'm scared, Anna. Help me.
David has been taken to Buchenwald.
It's my own fault.
Do you know what's in Buchenwald?
Tell me.
We're getting married, if I want to.
And I want to.
Anna. Sweet, dear Anna.
- He wants me in Vienna. He has leave.
- How can he have leave now?
"Got tired. Russia too big.
Eight days too late for Stalingrad."
"Official leave. Come to Vienna.
Get married, if you want. Martin."
I don't understand, but I want to.
I want to.
Good luck.
Goodbye.
Anna. Goodbye, Anna.
Anna, wait!
Anna, wait! From Holland!
From your sister.
Just for a few months,
of course.
But of course.
I think it will be a lot of fun.
Don't you, Dinand?
We'll pay all the expenses.
Have I made that clear?
Yes, yes.
Plenty of space now that the girls have
left home. Such lovely little rooms.
- Until we find a definite solution.
- Jet's room...
Dad.
- Is it all right?
- Oh, did I not make that clear?
Of course it is.
It's our humane duty.
Welcome.
From David.
"If I don't get my sailboat soon,
it will be too late. David."
- He's asking for help.
- Auschwitz. Now it's Auschwitz.
My darling, my sweet.
I want to go to him.
-
-
Mother.
Just for once, let me be alone...
in this stupid house.
Welcome home,
Mr. and Mrs. Grosalie.
Did it hurt?
It hurt terribly.
Did you cry?
I'm a man.
Oh, my hero.
Don't worry. I'm with the signals unit.
They're not in any danger.
Goodbye!
What's this supposed to be?
What is this?
Mash?
Looks more and more like water.
Is that it? Do I not get any more?
Hmm?
Never mind, then.
I'm so nervous. I hope I recognize him.
- As long as he recognizes you.
- I'm sure he will.
- The girls.
-
Martin. Martin!
- They say it's almost over.
- The Russians are at West Prussia.
Maybe you won't have to go back.
Then we'll go back to Vienna.
Don't look.
Now.
It's a bit premature, but I don't have
much to do at your parents'.
That's what I want. A baby.
As long as I have a lot. A big family.
On Sundays we'll go for walks.
Will you come?
Actually, I'd like a girl first.
I don't know why.
Now I know what I really want.
Twins. Two girls.
And they'll always stay together.
-  Gas?
- Yes, gas.
What kind of sick idea is that?
It was in the paper. I'm not making it up.
What was in the paper?
Something about shower rooms,
where the enemy prisoners, it said,
were driven in naked and gassed.
- Naked?
- And that the capacity of the chambers
has been raised...
from 200 to 1,000 people per day.
- Of course that isn't true.
- Are you calling me a liar?
There's mail?
There hasn't been a letter
for a long time.
There is mail.
"Dear Frau Grosalie."
"it is my duty as company commander
to inform you
of your husband's heroic death."
In the Eiffel. Shellfire.
"Certain of our victory,
and our rightful cause, I remain..."
"Your husband's heroic death."
They swept him together
and buried him in that village.
At least you had a grave.
There was no cemetery in Auschwitz.
Father?
Do you know where Lotte is?
Lotte!
Lotte, are you coming?
Everyone's going. Are you coming?
I want to see the Canadians.
We don't want to be late.
Do you think David will still want me?
I don't think David is coming back.
And I think...
that you think that, too.
Are you awake?
My little girl.
Lotte?
An official notice about David.
Do you want to read it?
Well, what it boils down to...
It's what we already suspected.
In Auschwitz.
What we suspected.
Lotte.
My little bunny rabbit.
Can I help you?
Yes. Could you tell me where...
Damn, a bloody Hun.
Piss off, won't you?
Lotte.
You have a baby.
I didn't know that.
Never again.
Start a fight, curse her,
hit her, I don't know,
- but do something. This is terrible.
-
You have to talk to her.
Get over it. She can't help it.
And you don't know anything about her.
They're not all Nazis.
Talk to her. You'll find out.
She's family, Lotte.
Your twin sister, for God's sake.
Lotte, please.
Lotte.
Come.
All glued together.
For the sound.
I came for her.
She's the only one I have left.
Get out!
Get out of my house, Nazi!
Nazi. You killed him.
You and that man.
Do you want an SS whore
in your home?
Get out!
Get out of my life.
I never want to see you again.
You're not my sister anymore.
So that's what it was.
Your twin sister,
the wife of an SS officer.
And now you speak Dutch.
Good, eh? I thought:
I won't let that happen to me twice.
We should get back. It's getting late.
I hardly knew
what was happening in Holland.
And about what happened to the Jews
we didn't find out until much later.
"We didn't know." Hmm?
Yes.
- We didn't know.
- We have to get back.
If I'd had TB instead of you,
our roles would have been reversed.
But would I have made the same choices?
Of course. You wouldn't have known
any better, just like me.
I would never have married an SS officer.
I didn't fall in love with an SS officer,
but with Martin,
the best man in the whole world.
I would never have fallen in love
with a murderer.
Martin was no murderer.
Where are we, for God's sake?
We've both been victims of circumstance.
Sorry, but I'm not going
to compare my life to yours.
Why not? Is my sorrow
worth any less than yours?
Damn it, Lotte. If you and I can't
understand each other, then who can?
- What will happen to the world?
- Shut up. I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to understand.
By forgiving you I'd betray David.
You don't have to forgive me.
I'm not asking for forgiveness.
I haven't done anything wrong.
I've always tried to do the right thing
and you're treating me like a monster.
- I didn't kill David!
- Oh, stop it, Anna.
You and I live in two different worlds.
They can never, ever meet.
I'm going this way. You go back.
I'll find another route.
-
- Hold on.
- We'll climb down slowly.
- Yes.
"The spirit is willing,
but the flesh is weak."
Well, there we are.
Dinner can be served here,
as far as I'm concerned.
Lotte, I didn't kill David.
I know that.
But you feel I'm responsible.
I'm not really sure that I do.
- The very last one.
- Mm-hm.
Mmm.
Lovely.
A feast.
- Do you have any children?
- No.
I couldn't have any,
thanks to Uncle Heinrich's beatings.
I later got a job
with the Child Welfare Council.
That's where I worked
for the rest of my life.
And I really enjoyed it.
Little Anna.
I'm so cold, so cold.
I understand.
She knew that she...
She wanted me...
for me to...
before she...
- That's what it was.
- Madam.
I understand.
Who is this woman?
Anna. My sister.
My twin sister.
