A big boat for his grandkids
our forefather decided to build.
He had been building it all his
life.
But that forefather of ours had
no time to finish it,
leaving it to our grandfather.
We had been waiting for that
boat in vain...
Victory!
A big boat for his grandkids
our father decided to finish.
He had been building it all his
life.
We had been dreaming, my friend,
of circling the world
in that boat.
But our dreams had been shattered,
dreams shattered...
And we started to build a tall ship.
Victory!
Equality!
Brotherhood!
Peace! Peace!
Victory!
There will come the day, my son,
when you wake up at dawn
on a ship,
and stand firmly on the deck,
facing the ocean of life.
And embodied in you will be
all our dreams, our dreams...
The grandfather's boat has grown
into a ship.
There it is sailing free,
our pride,
not fearful of any storm.
Be worthy, my son,
of accepting our banner
in fond memory
and with a reliable hand.
And take along on yourjourney
my faith,
your fortune and the future world!
It will come!
It will be here for all mankind!

...Sixty three, sixty four,
sixty five, sixty six,
sixty seven...
Sixty seven.
You're really nervous.
What are you all doing here?
Is there nothing else to do?
I get tired just thinking of
all the work there's to do.
Our work is just peanuts.
Zabelin's got the real work.
Like what?
Just keep away from his saber.
Let him learn.
Enough of saber-rattling.
I think we may need swords yet.
It would make it much easier if we
could see the enemy's face.
But when it's like that, it's hard,
guys.
For renting the grain warehouse,
we made a deposit of 50 rubles.
Besides, we've got a bill
for the purchase of forage.
Here, the oats for a total of
and the hay comes to
And then there's also a bill
from the insurance fund.
We have paid 700 rubles
and 14 rubles 20 kopecks penalty
for being tardy.
Sorry, I meant 18 kopecks.
I feel like I'm being buried
in this pile of accounts!
That's some job
for a cavalry officer!
Why are you looking at me
like that, old man?
Debit-credit, balance-galance!
I can't stand it any more!
- Mylnikov, Ishlanov wants you.
- Coming.
- Good morning.
- Hi!
To all Regional Party Committees!
Thousands of our citizens are
dying and require our help.
The League of Nations has refused
assistance to the starving Russia...
Food will only be delivered
against payment in gold.
I therefore direct that
all confiscated gold and valuables
be sent immediately
to Moscow.
Dzerzhinsky,
Chairman of the Cheka.
What can you expect? The League
of Nations...
- How much did we confiscate?
- In gold, 526 thousand.
We have to ship it to Moscow,
but how?
What can I do? We've got one
armored car, two machine guns.
And fifty men. Not enough?
But it's all we've got.
We know. Brylov's band
has been reported in the area.
Thanks, Tamara.
- We'll send Grunko, Dmitriev...
- Lemekh.
And Yegor Shilov. They'll be
held personally responsible.
Send me along. You've got
to let me go.
Grunko, Dmitriev,
Lemekh and Yegor Shilov.
They'll be the only ones to be
told that they're carrying gold.
Yegor can handle this right.
This past spring, the band of
Ataman Soloveyko was wiped out.
During the operation, a Cossack
officer, Fyodor Shilov, was killed.
As we discovered later, he was
the brother of Yegor Shilov.
Well, so what?
We'll be shipping a treasure.
We can't take any chances.
So I'm against Shilov.
Explain the joke to me,
will you, Lipyagin?
Shilov fought for three years
in my battalion alongside of me!
Yegor has nothing in common
with his brother.
A war record
can'tjustify everything.
I don't know.
Maybe, I'm wrong.
What do you think,
Comrade Kungurov?
Well, what do you want me to say?
We all have to decide.
Many relatives fought against each
other. Sons, fathers, brothers...
That's how a revolution is.
As for Yegor Shilov, he is...
He's one of us and I will vouch
for him.
I suggest we vote on all
the candidates together.
In favor? Opposed? Abstentions?
The day after tomorrow, on the 17th,
there's a train to Moscow.
We're going to attach the armored
car to it.
- No!
- No what?
I'm giving up cigarettes.
I can feel my heart pounding.
So, Kolia's become quite
abstemious.
Take my place, and I'll see
what you're going to become.
Suppose we switch? You take over
the accounts, I'll fight the Whites.
Your cartridge belt.
You'll escort the gold to Moscow
on the seventeenth, at 6:30 p.m.
I suggest you get lots of sleep
before that.
And try not to leave your home.
You'll be personally responsible
for the gold and valuables.
- Any questions?
- No.
You've got a difficult assignment,
Yegor. You'll be in charge.
- What's funny?
- Everything will be fine, Nikolai.
Farewell dear heart, adieu my joy.
You go away and leave me behind...
Listen, I didn't vote for you.
Getting old, I guess.
Nerves aren't holding out.
I'll stay alone till you return.
Farewell, I'll never see you again.
I swear no other girl will ever
tempt me.
You're the only joy of my life,
and yet I must say farewell to you.
- He'll be here any minute.
- Good.
There's everything you need.
Keep him asleep till I tell you.
- And the needle?
- I said everything you need.
But I don't see the reason for
doing that.
After the operation he could
leave the Cheka for good.
Just do yourjob, Fannyackov.
Stop it. My name is Vanyukin.
Fannyackov.
I'll do everything just right,
I assure you.
- Mitka, Shilov's been killed!
- I know. I'm coming!
I'm through here. His whole body
is covered with traces of torture.
His face was disfigured
beyond recognition.
He was killed by two bullets
in the neck.
Take him away. You can go.
Sasha!
All right, Vassily Antonovich,
I'm going.
Well?
I don't know, I can't...
Is the gold in the safe?
Have you checked it? Then do it!
Stepan, go to the Cheka. Send for
Grunko, Dmitriev, Lemekh.
- Did you hear what I said?
- I heard you.
You're going in Shilov's place.
What's wrong with you? It's not
the first death you've seen.
I can't go on doing this work.
Send me to the army or to industry.
To let a man like you go into
a factory? Just forget that!
I won't let you, I...
The gold will be shipped out today,
and without any army escort.
The armored car will stay in
the station. In view of everyone.
Let those who murdered Shilov
think we've postponed the shipment.
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- I do.
Go to the station now and see
that it's arranged.
This is how it should have been
done from the start.
No noise, no escort.
Yegor might still be alive.
My heart is trying to tell me
something.
- I'm nervous and worried.
- It's all those cigarettes.
I'm going to quit.
- Are the boys asleep?
- Yes.
- The compartments all locked?
- All locked.
And there're no profiteers on
the roof either.
We're traveling first class.
- Lebedev, do you use lipstick?
- Sure I do. Take it easy.
Each to his own taste.
Gentlemen, the train!
- Everything ready? The semaphore?
- Yes.
- Don't move from the switch.
- Got it.
The operation must take 4 minutes,
or we'll all go off the bridge.
The signal is the white tower.
And make sure of one thing...
I haven't finished yet, Captain.
There's no need to explain
anything, Staff-captain.
It stinks of cologne in there
like in a soldiers' whorehouse.
- Well, now?
- The train's slowing down here.
Let's go!
- What're you waiting for?
- Here I go.
A red signal! There's never
been a stop here!
Grab the bag! Move!
Jump!
- The bag!
- I've got it!
It all went well. Just right.
Thank you.
I gave him three ampules.
He's been out all the time.
Let him go? I got it, I got it...
Yes, I see...
Thank you. Thank you.
If you want me to let him go,
go he will.
Bandits! Jesus!
What shall we do?
Everyone out of the car! Move!
Or I'll shoot!
What are you doing?
Get away!
Don't touch it!
Lemke!
He locked us in.
My name is Guivi, darling.
- This is no time for games, dear.
- That's it, friend.
That's that.
Where is it?
Good God! Gone!
I want to join you.
- Who are you?
- Captain Lemke.
Where were you going?
I've been wandering since Chita.
I want to fight the Reds.
It isn't worthwhile,
fighting the Reds.
Especially with today's booty,
wouldn't you say?
Today's loot isn't much, you know.
Just some junk.
Hey, move along, move along!
- I would like to...
- All right, hop on, help yourself.
Klava! They killed Stepan!
It happened between Kedrovka
and Berezovaya, we think.
Brylov has disappeared.
We don't know what happened
to Lipyagin and his comrades.
- Andrei Timofeyevich!
- Lay off, or you're a dead man!
You must sign those bills!
I've been waiting five days!
What are you waiting for?
Come here!
We must send an expeditionary
force, or Brylov'll escape again.
What are you doing?
Half a million stolen!
Yegor and Lipyagin have been
murdered, and you stand around?
Alyokhin, start her up!
Cool down, Andrei.
Calm down.
There must be something behind
this. I mean Shilov and his brother.
Yes, something's wrong here,
Vassily Antonovich.
Shilov is dead!
Loosen the girths before
the horse starts eating.
It's just me, don't get scared.
You know, I don't trust you.
Don't trust you at all.
- Why not?
- I don't really know.
Listen, Brylov!
Suppose plenty of money fell into
your hands? Say, 500,000 in gold.
What would you do?
Don't take your eyes off him for
a second. Or I'll tear your ears off.
I don't understand how it is
possible
not to remember anything at all.
- Had you been drinking?
- I didn't drink.
- Then how did you end up there?
- Andrei, stay out of this!
Let's see, Yegor...
Where are your documents?
Your party card?
I don't know.
I can't remember anything.
Not a thing!
- Where the hell was he...
- Andrei! Calm down!
All right, let's start again
from the very beginning.
- You had come back home...
- Yes, I had come back.
- Where was your revolver?
- Under my pillow, as usual.
Here, take mine. Put it
under the pillow and sit down.
We'll try to reconstruct it.
No, guys, I can't remember
anything. Even if you kill me.
You've already been killed once,
and they put somebody else's body!
And then Lipyagin was murdered,
and Dmitriev, Lemekh and Grunko!
Because of you! The gold's
been stolen because of you, too!
You're all crazy
to listen to his lies!
The Whites knew when the train was
leaving and that the gold was on it.
How did they find out?
And you... you think that I...
But you don't remember anything.
You could babble while being drunk.
I didn't have a drop to drink!
- Then where were you three days?
- Listen to me, for God's sake!
Nikolai, get him out of here.
What are you doing to me, guys?
Itjust isn't right, isn't right.
Come on, we need
to find out the truth.
What? The truth?
What about me?
You think I don't want the truth?
Only you? You...
Stop! Stop the car!
- He's taking the cattle to the station?
- Yes, sending it to the starving.
Ho ho ho! Move along!
I have to get out a minute.
- To do what?
- I have to go.
- Why didn't you do it before?
- I didn't need to then.
You can't. Hold it back.
All right, keep moving!
- Look at those authorities!
- Forget it, come on.
- Look, I can't hold it any more.
- What d'you want me to do?
Sergei, stop, please!
Come on, don't humiliate me.
I can't hold back any longer.
- Alyoshin, come with me.
- Alright, but you'll have to hurry.
I'll hurry.
- Where're you going?
- I can't do it in the street...
Hey, stop!
I'm sorry, Alyoshin,
but there's no other way.
They're going to shoot me today,
and I have to find out the truth.
I won't believe it!
It can't be true!
No, it isn't true.
I'm back.
- Hello.
- And hello to you.
Well? Shall we talk?
Yes, sir.
Who is it?
Who are you?
Why are you staring like that?
- Who are you?
- Shilov, Yegor Petrovich.
- You in the Cheka?
- Yes, I'm in the Cheka.
It's not fair, Shourik.
It's a pretty mean thing to do.
Let's take a ride.
I don't like what you did.
I collected the gold, it was mine,
and you took it all for yourself.
That isn't right to cheat your
elders.
Five hundred thousand
that you took on the train.
It was you who robbed the train,
wasn't it?
I did all the work,
and you don't want to share.
It isn't right, Shourik. Itjust
isn't right!
Ah, Lemke, Lemke...
You know, if you're lying,
you'll regret it. Let's go!
Let's get back!
So that's your game? The gold
is in the band, and you keep mum?
You wanted to have it all for
yourself, didn't you?
You bastard, what the hell
are you doing here?
That's for the "bastard"!
- Where is the gold?
- Somewhere around here.
- You've got a spy in the Cheka?
- Yes.
- What's his name?
- To hell with you, you Red dog!
That's for the "Red dog"!
Idiot...
What's his name?
Say "please".
I'll kill you, bastard.
No, you won't. You are going
to take good care of me,
because only I know
who is our man in the Cheka.
Well, that's some company
we've got.
Now listen!
That's all your own business.
As for the gold,
not a word about it, get it?
If my boys get wind of it,
there might be trouble.
We don't want it,
don't you agree?
Calm down, Vanyukin.
Tell us all about it in good order.
All right. But I don't know who
the chief is. I never saw him.
Only the officers saw him, not me.
Then how did you get your orders?
On the telephone.
Yes, that's how it was...
Or sometimes through the officers.
But they're all dead.
Or maybe the bandits
captured them?
In that case, someone might
still get in touch with you?
What narcotic
was it that you gave Shilov?
I don't know about drugs. They
brought some ampules and a needle.
What kind of narcotic was it?
They gave me the needle and
the doses.
Vanyukin, do you realize that
you've got no choice?
I came here voluntarily. Comrade
Shilov told me to, and I did.
In the morning you'll wait at the
station for the officers to show up.
Then you'll report to us.
And make no mistake.
You can count on me.
- Everything understood?
- Very well understood.
Take him away!
Yes, I'll be going now.
Excuse me...
Well, Andrei, I think that now
we need your talent.
- Uncle Andrei, take me along!
- No, you can't go.
Alexei, have the squadron stand by!
Squadron, fall in!
- Katya!
- Andrei!
Fare thee well, dear girl of mine,
You'll stay behind till I come back...
- Why your saber on the right side?
- You know I'm left-handed.
We must follow the regulations.
- Why are you so stern?
- I've lost my cigarette holder.
- It's time to get going.
- All right.
Father...
Vanya, come here!
You can see better from here!
Good morning. How are you,
Comrades?
Squadron! Attention!
Good luck!
Warriors!
Heroic soldiers of the revolution!
Undefeated remnants of the enemy
still lurk in dark corners!
The serpents of treason await the
moment to get at our throats!
Our revolutionary fatherland is
in danger!
The fiendish enemy is still hoping
to turn back the clock!
But our forces are vigilant!
We will defeat the traitors,
though it costs our lives,
because the peasants and workers
are always victorious!
Squadron!
At the trot! Forward march!
What's the matter?
What is it?
Vanyukin was found murdered
in his cell.
I've questioned the guards.
No one came in but our own people.
Who?
Who of our people?
I was there.
Had tea with the chief guard.
- Kolia! What's wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong with me.
When the murderer came in,
Vanyukin probably woke and got up.
The murderer stunned him with
a blow.
There's a hematoma
on the right cheek.
- Then he was stabbed.
- You may go.
Thank you, Grigory
Christoforovich.
Damn this whole rotten business!
The right cheek...
Catch!
- What's that?
- Nothing.
I found this in Vanyukin's cell.
That's Zabelin's.
The devil!
- Is this yours?
- Mine.
And the gold? Where's it?
You show me. Hurry!
I have pity the horse. Bey no good.
- Your father is a Bey?
- What? He ain't Bey!
Kaioum want get married.
No money pay dowry for girl!
My father old.
My mother she old.
House so old.
All rain coming in house.
Kaioum so poor, not have coat.
Every jackal has great coat.
Kaioum have no coat whole year.
Horse! Horse was sick!
I not run far away!
I sorry for horse!
That's enough!
Where's the gold?
Here is gold. Take, jackal!
Put it back for now.
You fool!
Swim toward the shore!
Let the current push you!
- Grab me!
- Don't want!
Hold on, dammit!
Let go! I don't want!
Who gave you this skinhead?
There's nothing to get hold of.
No! Let me drown!
What if I hadn't been able to swim?
You'd have drowned, you dimwit!
Why not let me drown?
Then all gold only for you.
For you, for you! Is that all
you know how to say?
The Bey you say is bad, and all
you want is to be one someday.
Then you'd beat your tenants
like your Bey did. You would.
You see, brother, it's Marxism,
that's what teaches us how to act.
How you know I take gold? Ah?
That chain was from the bag.
Did you know you're starting
to grow horns, on top of your head?
All those who steal from
their brothers, the poor,
will end up with horns on top
of their heads!
You understand?
It's rotten, friend,
to steal from your brothers.
You save my life.
Now you my brother.
- Give me back my blanket.
- I didn't take it.
Did you find the gold?
You drink too much!
They're fifteen miles from here,
Excellency. Maybe less...
In any case,
we must be very cautious...
Near the village of Rossokhi.
A squadron of about 300 men.
They have machine-guns
mounted on wagons.
I can't really vouch for it,
there're no guarantees.
If they press us down to the river,
we won't stand a chance.
Not a chance!
If they catch us backed up at
the stream, not a chance.
Go get the horses ready, you hear?
What the hell is there to joke
about? You want us all exterminated?
You know, Lemke, I think it's time
to cut the commissars' guts out.
And then it's your turn.
Semyon, when are you going
to give me a haircut?
- Have you seen the captain?
- No.
Where's he gotten to?
Captain! Captain Lemke!
I have a cold. I can't breathe
as long as you keep my mouth shut.
And I tell you once more,
I think you're really dumb.
You may kill me, but still I won't
give you the name of our agent.
Not unless we share the gold.
Be reasonable, Shilov, come on!
Split the gold. One half for each,
more money than we've ever seen.
Have you ever even had
as much as five rubles in your hand?
You haven't. And now, 250,000.
Can't you get it through your head?
Devil! Jackal!
It wasn't my fault!
- What's wrong?
- Kill him!
He know about gold.
He tell Brylov.
Excellency take it... Run away...
Leave band...
It wasn't my fault!
He beat me!
- Where did he go?
- Toward the bridge.
- When?
- At sunset.
Then he has a five hours' start.
Down the river!
We need raft, Commander!
We need a tree!
Quick we catch him, Commander!
Oh, how he fooled you...
Hurray for Brylov!
He said he would take me along...
He beat me... It's not my fault!
We'll trap them at the ford and cut
them down with the machine-guns.
- What time is it?
- It's still too early.
No, it's time!
And here we go!
Squadron! Fall in!
Watch out! Hold her steady!
Hang on tight!
There's Brylov saying hello to you.
We got him, Kaioum!
Push ashore now!
The devil... All right...
Kaioum, go ahead with the gun.
Cover me.
- Sun in eyes. I cannot see.
- Here, I'll take the gun.
Leave me alone, it's all your show.
I'll stay neutral.
You fight and I'll wait.
You won't have long to wait,
Captain. It'll be ended soon.
You circle around to the right, I'll
draw their attention to the cliff.
I hope you kill each other,
the sooner the better.
- Stay here!
- You idiot!
Shilov!
- I can no help you, Shilov.
- I'm stuck.
I can no more... I try...
Ah, that's the end.
That's the end!
- Well, that's the end?
- Where are you going? Get back!
What are you doing? Get back,
I said!
- What?
- Get back.
You dog!
Untie my hands, quick!
Damn you!
I risked my life for that gold
a hundred times.
And you want to take it?
Bastard! You son of a bitch!
Throw that toy away, idiot!
Or I'll kick your teeth in!
Kill him, Shilov!
You got him! My dear man!
- You going to carry me on your back?
- I'll carry you.
Too bad Brylov didn't kill me.
That would've spoiled your show.
Listen, Shilov, show me the gold.
I've been after it for so long.
Tell me, what are you going to do
with it? I'd like to know that.
Give it back to your side,
and what's next?
They'll shoot you all the same.
Do you understand that?
The border is close, it's right
there!
Cross it, don't be an idiot!
The gold won't last a minute if it's
for everybody, you get it?
You get this chance only once.
Never again!
Can't you understand? Once
in a lifetime!
Holy Father...
Lord, why do you help this idiot,
and not me?
Because you're too greedy.
And even God teaches us to share.
Now pipe down,
I need a rest.
I'll have to carry you
on my back yet.
Catch!
- You did it with your left hand.
- So what? I'm left-handed.
That gold was stolen by some
members of your underground group.
You kidnapped Shilov and
substituted a railroad man's body.
That's a good one!
You're kidding?
All right, I'll play along with you.
You have nothing better to do?
What clowns you are!
But Shilov forced your liaison man
to give himself up.
Then you killed Vanyukin and put
Zabelin's cigarette holder in his cell.
Here, Andrei, you lost this!
We would've swallowed your bait,
if it hadn't been for your left hand.
- You're left-handed, aren't you?
- Yes, I'm left-handed...
First you hit Vanyukin with your
left hand, then you stabbed him.
- Didn't you?
- Sure, I killed everybody.
I stabbed everybody.
But hasn't this gone far enough?
Even for a joke?
Everybody knows me, Nikodimov.
The real Nikodimov was killed
on his way here from Omsk.
His wife can testify to that.
That's bullshit.
Nikodimov has no wife.
So you thought. Your men
were supposed to kill her.
But, luckily, she survived.
That's something you didn't know.
What a bunch of clowns you are!
Farewell dear heart, adieu my joy,
You go away and leave me behind.
I'll stay alone till you return...
What's wrong?
They didn't believe me.
They think I'm a traitor.
You lousy Rothschild!
Lemke! Lemke!
Captain!
Why are you standing? Go away!
Let me die.
I ask you as a man and a soldier.
- What about the prisoners?
- Escort them to HQ.
- Go on, I'll catch up with you.
- All right.
Squadron! Fall in!
Shilov's gone! Brylov's gone!
And the gold's gone!
It's my fault, Dmitry Petrovich.
I initiated the shipping of gold.
And I will have
to answer for my actions
before whatever superior
authorities the Party decides.
And Yegor...
There must be a village...
or a place to get water...
Hey... Brothers...
The End
