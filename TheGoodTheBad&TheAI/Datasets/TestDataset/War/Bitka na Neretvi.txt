On Neretva in occupied Europe,
we have fought one of the most famous
and most human battles -
battle for saving the wounded.
The fate of the revolution was
at stake here,
and here the brotherhood and unity of
our nations won.
In the beginning of 1943 in
the free partisan republic.
Long live our shock workers!
Long live comrade Tito!
That's right, closer, closer.
Put you hands on the sister, that's right.
Hey, photographer!
-What is it?
Shall I bow down so you don't
cut off my head? - Stand straight!
Smile!
Brothers!
Nations of Yugoslavia.
Serbs, Macedonians, Croats,
Slovenians, Montenegrins
and Muslims.
Let's unite to defend our republic.
Long live our allies, the Soviet
Union, England and USA.
Long live AVNOJ
.
Mr. general, 3. squad is ready.
Is everybody here? - Yes, Mr. general,
only general Morelli hasn't arrived yet.
Make sure no one will be bothering
us!
When the Italians come, let them
wait a bit.
Maybe they will be more punctual
next time.
I understand, Mr. general.
Gentlemen, general.
Attention!
Mr. general,
the division commanders are waiting
to be given duties.
-Good morning, gentlemen.
Gentlemen!
You all know the "Weiss" plan
very well.
The Fuhrer's headquarters have
given orders to start the military
operations.
We only have 24 hours.
We will attack tomorrow morning.
So gentlemen, here in the middle
is the partisan area.
Let's start on the east.
You, colonel Reichtal,
attack with the division in the middle.
The Anacker platoon and the 717. division
will be with you.
Colonel Mülleneisen, your division
will attack from the west.
The objective of the attack is
here and here.
The Italian divisions and 18.000 Chetniks
will come from the south.
You, colonel Kränzer, will strike with the
division and the Ustashas from the north
directly into the middle of
Tito's state.
I understand,
Mr. general.
Are your squads ready?
-Not yet, Mr. general.
We will take the positions
till 20.30.
That is all. Do you want
to smoke a cigarette?
Tito will have to defend himself on
four front lines,
if he will want to save several
thousand wounded.
That's why he will try to
retain his position.
Which is good for us.
Now we have the final opportunity
to get rid of all the partisans.
You mean an invasion?
-That's right.
You all know about the British and American
plans for the invasion on the Balkan.
When we get rid of the partisans
all of the Balkan will be in German hands
and the allies will have to
think twice.
Thank you very much.
Yes, my dear gentlemen!
This war is not about soldier
against soldier.
This is...
How do you call it,
Kränzer?
War into the back.
-That's right, war into the back.
War against
children and civilians.
Fuehrer's order is there should be no
indulgence and no captives!
Mr general, the Italians...
-Yes, let the Italians come.
Another thing, gentlemen.
Don't forget that each partisan's life
that you spare,
can avenge against you next time with a
hand grenade
or a shot from a gun.
That is all. I wish you luck
gentlemen!
Kränzer, it will be the toughest for you.
Do what you can.
Oh, general!
How are you, fine?
If you want I can repeat the
operation plan for you.
Good day,
friends!
Machine guns on the mules!
Quick!
Faster, boys!
Commander!
Excuse me, commander. Where are
they taking us? This doesn't look good.
Good?
The worst is yet to come.
We will be the first attacking the
partisans on their own territory.
Excuse me, but why?
That's how it will be.
It won't be easy.
This war means more to them then life
and we are strangers here.
There is the colonel!
Captain Riva!
Come here please.
Commander!
Hurry up, we're late.
We must be in Prozor before night falls.
General Morelli
is already there.
I understand, sir!
Why are you resting?
Who is the commander?
Over here, Mr. colonel!
What are these people doing?
The trucks are waiting.
There is no time to rest now.
Get back to work, immediately!
Horst, report our positions!
Anton one, Anton one,
come in!
Lion two speaking. We have reached
position 4.
May God be with you, Chetniks!
Brother Chetniks,
listen to me!
The time has come for us to
draw the swords.
Yes, the moment of decision is
before us.
My soul is groaning and shivering
when i think about the victims,
but it is a honorable thing to
fight to the last drop of
blood for the king and the homeland.
With the help of the German forces we
will deal a lethal blow to them.
To these jackals and fake patriots!
Tanks, divisions of a mighty army
are with us.
With God's help,
brother Chetniks,
let us get ready to ram a hawthorn pole
into their savage hearts.
Soon Tito's head will fall down
to my feet.
Slaughter!
- Attack!
Fight, fight!
The congress of partisan doctors
has ended!
Two more brigades founded in Slovenia!
General fight against typhus!
Doctor Marija,
take a picture with us!
Don't move!
Now children, read aloud!
AVNOJ
Run!
They will kill us all!
Comrades, open up!
-Help!
Run for your lives!
Follow me, typhus people!
Flee from the city!
Follow my voice.
Over here!
Here!
Lie down!
Hide yourself!
Stretchers, over here!
Fire!
Forward!
Forward!
Horst, infantry into assault!
Horst. -They're not responding.
-Call them again!
Berta, come in.
Berta, come in.
Tell the 2nd regiment to
reinforce the left wing.
Tanks forward!
The 2nd regiment should reinforce
the left wing.
The left wing, at once!
Martin, shorten the effective range!
The tanks approaching.
Fire with the artillery without a break.
I understand!
There is no retreat!
We musn't withdraw, not even for
a single meter.
On enemy tanks and
infantry...
Fire!
Put me through to the general in
person.
Yes, colonel Kränzer speaking.
Not yet, general.
The resistance is very strong.
We can't break the resistance today
but we will break through tomorrow.
Thank you.
Over.
Fire!
For homeland, forward!
Fire!
Load!
Vuko, Vuko!
Call my brother,
Novak.
Fire!
Ivan!
Headquarters.
Brigade commander Ivan speaking.
I understand!
I understand!
The headquarters are giving an order
to retreat towards Bihac.
Which means that the Germans have
broken through the front line.
Somewhere in the other sector.
-Yes.
Hello!
Call Martin!
Martin!
The headquarters are ordering a retreat
do you understand?
That we should retreat!
-I will not retreat, don't you understand!
I don't want to! Go into counterattack.
Attack!
What counterattack?
-In counterattack!
Martin!
Hello, Martin!
I am going to the Slovenian
because he doesn't want to fulfil the order.
You should prepare the brigade retreat!
- And you should stay with the artillery!
Have patience!
-Don't tell sister Dana.
Don't tell her! - Vuko.
-Don't tell, Damir...
Vuko, brother.
I'm sorry Novak.
I must get to Martin as soon as possible.
We can't fight head-on,
because our forces would quickly evaporate.
The enemy has technical, numerical superiority
and is superior in general.
The headquarters have reached a decision,
comrades,
that we leave the free territory together
with the wounded and the people.
We will do what the enemy least
expects;
we will move into counterattack,
continue towards the Neretva river
and forward to the east.
In other words - we will move
into a several hundred kilometer run.
One who has 4.000 wounded along
doesn't run, comrade Vuka.
Doesn't run,
but ties his own hands.
What will happen to the partisan mobility
if we burden ourselves with
the typhus people,
women and children?
But Vuka, we must act primarily
as humans.
Who of us, has the right to
to jeopardize the fate of our fight
because of the wounded?
I only ask you that.
-The human inside us has that right.
You must understand, the path to freedom
must be pure.
I'm not in favor of mercy
that leads the revolution to suicide.
Ask the wounded that question,
revolution or them?
They will all say that the revolution
is more important.
That's the reason why they're going
with us and we will defend them till the
very end.
There is no dilemma for me here.
Stole will explain to you the basic
plan of the operation.
Comrades.
By order of the headquarters
and comrade Tito
my division and your self-dependent brigade Ivan,
with the assistance of the striking divisions,
that are covering our flanks,
we will move towards the city of Prozor.
Stevo, you will stay in the north
and defend the central hospital
and the population.
-I understand!
Vlado, Vlado.
Wake up!
This concerns your
engineers.
You must mine all the roads that
lead to Bihac as soon as possible.
You must stop the Germans.
-Ok, agreed.
The artillery should also immediately
head towards Neretva.
Comrades. We are starting with the counterattack
far across Neretva.
Get to work!
Dr. Marija.
Will this medical bulk ever get off?
These are seriously wounded people, not a brigade.
We can't do it faster.
Call the head surgeon!
Why is the hospital late?
-We are doing our job. We cant work faster.
The city must be emptied till the evening, hurry up.
-I understand.
Comrade commander!
Order them to untie me!
I'm not crazy.
Comrade commander,
tell dr. Marija to
remove the bullet from my head.
I want to be in command.
Stop!
The attack is getting started!
Bosko. Calm down. We will take
the bullet out later.
Everything will be fine. You will
be riding a white horse.
I want that.
I like riding a white horse very much.
You're heavy as lead. - If I had legs
I would be even heavier.
Take the Sumadin man over here.
Over here, on the carriage!
Thank you.
Now I will play till
Sumadija, Nada.
I will.
Everything ready, boys?
-Ready. -To shelter!
Comrade Nazor,
I have come for you.
I am ready Stole,
I am ready for a long journey.
I only have this suitcase and
these books.
I have ordered fighter Zika to take
care of you.
We have even provided you a cow so you
will have milk.
During the battle you will be in the
column where the head hospital will also be.
Thank you, Stole.
Where are you from Zika? - From the village of
Koracica in Sumadija.
Take your suitcase and the books.
They will come with us.
Who ever saw so many books being
lugged along during battle!
Listen, Zika. These books are written
in my language and in yours.
In our language.
In mine and your language.
They were written by great men.
There are some of mine among them.
I can't separate from the books.
I have nothing against books and poems.
But I didn't join the partisans to drag along
a cow, books and...
Enough of the foolish talk! You're responsible
for the books and comrade Nazor.
I understand.
-I'll tell you something else, Zika.
A nation without poets and a language,
cannot win freedom by fighting.
-I understand comrade commander.
Farewell, poet!
-Thank you for your hospitality!
Goodbye.
-Good luck.
Let's go daughter-in-law,
don't cry!
We will return one day.
Fire!
Stop, stop!
Cattle! You're stopping in the middle
of the slope! What is it?
Can we come in?
I have been dragging them along for 15 days,
they're hardly standing any more.
There is no more room. It's full,
don't you see? Get lost!
I won't because of them.
Even the headquarters ordered,
that we shouldn't leave even old women
behind.
Out of the way! -Jordan, Jordan.
We should at least take the child to Prozor.
How are we going to do that
if there is no room, Nada.
There is, that machine gunner
died a while ago.
What machine gunner?
- That only son, the schoolboy...
The red haired?
Don't come near! You won't do it,
I'm not moving from here.
Don't shout, put the child into the car.
And you give us a help.
Get him, Nada.
That's right.
May his soul rest.
-Stop crossing yourself, help out!
I'm going.
Come on, children!
Sit on the back seat!
Division,
prepare for battle!
Set the horses!
Put through the headquarters!
It's ruined.
Battery commanders,
come to me!
You help the wounded.
My commander was killed.
You command.
-I understand.
Put the dead on the carriages.
Put the wounded on the gun-carriages.
Tonight we will breaking through to Prozor.
It's starting to snow
so we must hurry up.
Hurry up.
-I understand!
Where is the commander, boys?
-Somewhere over here.
Hello, Stole.
-Hello, Ivan.
Were the air crafts pursuing you too?
-No, they just flew over me.
Immediately assemble all the commanders to the
meeting. -Ok.
Battalion commanders,
to the meeting.
Ivan.
Ivan.
How are you, Ivan?
-Good.
Novak.
Get up you lazy bum,
if the sister is coming!
I managed to get ours photos
from Bihac. They were still wet.
For you, for me... I'll give this
one to Vuk.
Such brothers!
Give me Vuk's photo.
I'll probably see him before you.
They have transferred him to
security.
Would you like to eat?
-Come on!
My questions is seemingly simple,
but it isn't.
Should we attack tonight Prozor
without the artillery with which
we can't establish
contact?
If we have set out to do this
we must attack immediately.
If we surprise the Italians tonight,
we still have a chance,
to break through up to Neretva.
-I agree with you.
We must reach Neretva as
soon as possible.
We all know that a surprise is better
then any artillery.
Good, I agree.
-To conclude;
we will attack the city from
all sides.
Mark the exact positions of your
forces on the map.
Stipe, bring me the map when
they finish. - I will.
Marking or no marking,
there will some fuss in any case..
Well comrade commanders,
show me this map.
Everyone get up!
-Prepare for departure!
Brigade, depart.
-Faster, faster.
Stipe.
When does the attack start?
-When the shooting stats.
Those who have to may stay.
Ivan, come.
Let's sit down.
Let's stay here a bit as though as
nobody is here.
It will be wonderful when we will be
together forever once.
But look, soon we will be dying
for Prozor.
Come!
Who is the brigade commander?
Call him!
Let's go, Danica!
Hurry!
Don't, there are only two or three days
till we reach it.
Just wait three days.
Three days, do you understand?
I personally set up the
defense.
We can hold out on these positions
till the end of the war and longer.
You, Mr. general,
you must try harder.
You must put more pressure on them on the north,
and we will wait for them here.
Where are your tanks now?
No, Morelli, please understand me.
We're closing the hoop.
You general,
must only wait.
Good bye, general,
farewell.
Major, prepare yourself!
The partisans will attack.
We'll show these scum! -I understand!
General Morelli's headquarters
here.
On the alert!
-Excellent, captain.
Slowly, carefully!
-I know, I'm being careful!
Carefully camouflage.
Good luck, good luck!
Heroic blood was shed tonight,
uncle Nazor.
You will have a lot to chant.
-My dear Zika. When will the time come
when i won't have to write about
human slaughterhouses?
Everything will be fine. As long as
we cross Neretva.
That's the most important thing!
Let's go, forward comrades,
to Prozor!
Stop, hold still!
Where are you going? Where is the
head surgeon? Hurry up, doctor.
Where? We all know where.
To Prozor.
What Prozor,
if we didn't conquer it.
Hasn't it fallen?
They were not able...
.... to attack, those whores.
What will the headquarters
do will all this misery,
when the German is putting pressure on us from behind ,
and the Italian doesn't allow us to move ahead?
Where? Go back!
-Back where, tell us?
I don't know. I do know that you can't
go through Prozor. -Back where?
Doctor,
take over the new wounded.
Comrade fighters, hand over the wounded
to the hospital, quickly .
We had such hopes last night,
and today this...
What will we do now,
Martin?
I don't' know. Ivan and Stole shouldn't
attack without the canons.
Division, to the barracks.
You have fought greatly.
Well done, boys!
Attention!
You were excellent. You have fought
bravely and firmly.
You have dealt the resistance a big blow.
-Vacation, Mr. general!
Who said that?
-I did.
We will speak about that soon, too.
I promise you that we will talk about
that on Easter.
We have prevented the enemy of crossing
Neretva.
No we must completely destroy all
the partisans together with the Germans.
The sooner we destroy them,
the sooner we will have vacation.
I give you my word for that.
-Long live the general!
You don't feel well?
-Get lost!
Don't follow me like some loyal dog.
I don't want you to serve me or
pity me. Get lost!
Or I will transfer you.
Now go.
I don't need anyone, do you understand?
Not even you.
Nobody can help me.
Leave me alone.
I understand,
Mr. captain.
Hello, comrades!
-Hello!
We shouldn't have attacked without
the artillery.
You got beaten on your heads, now they're
bombing the wounded.
There must be a way out. I think..
-We will not think now,
we will act.
-Stole, this is an order.
I'm going to the position of the neighbouring
division, bye.
Let all the fighters see the order!
PROZOR MUST FALL TONIGHT.
TITO
It's cold!
A real wolfish country!
Fire!
Fire!
Aim your fire to the crossings!
Move the tanks to the city center!
Fire!
Fire!
First squad to the bunkers!
-Second squad to the left wing!
Follow me!
Forward to the city center!
Follow me!
Forward!
Follow me!
Here you are!
What is it, why are you shivering?
Are you afraid, you wuss?
Fire, fight!
Fight.
I'm commanding!
Why are you changing his nappy?
Let him die if he wants to!
I'm commanding!
Fire, Mate,
fire, Jure!
Forward!
To the bunkers,
forward!
Faster, faster!
Hello! I must speak with general Lohring
immediately.
Lohring, immediately!
Where is he?
Sleeping? Wake him up!
The enemy is entering the city.
Hurry up!
Fire!
Wait!
Look at Bosko.
Don't shoot, Ana.
Bosko!
-Bosko!
Bosko is diving!
Over here, you cowards,
here!
That's how you fight!
-Bosko, over here!
Who gave you the weapon? -Bosko
seized it, Bosko took it
Ana, we must bind him up.
To the hospital, immediately!
You won't tie me.
-Get away!
I'll kill you!
Vuka, what is it?
What, this fool will kill us.
Take aim at him!
Bosko!
Where are you, my commander!
Where are you, my hero!
I am here. I killed everyone.
Comrade commander,
I killed everyone for freedom.
My best commander!
Give me your hand!
Let's shake hands.
I told you not to touch the weapons.
Tie him!
Hold him.
What will we do now,
Mr. captain?
Don't be afraid, let's go!
-Where to?
I have made a decision.
I'll return to Prozor.
Mr. captain! I would like to stay
with the Italians because I want to go home.
With the partisans we will be far
from home.
I don't care about the rest.
Please Mr. captain,
don't leave me!
I'm not leaving you, Mario.
You don't want to go with me. Good luck!
Comrade fighters.
We have opened the path for the wounded.
Danica, Dana.
Are you looking for Novak?
He's alive, alive.
Vuko was a far better
comrade and fighter.
I feel bad about him.
Don't make that up,
you're lying Bosko.
I never lie. They found
him dead at a canon.
Don't make that up, you're lying.
He was looking for me, and the comrades
were nowhere, nowhere.
Don't make it up,
you're lying, lying!
And where are you?
Up there they all think you
fell in action.
Don't cock,
just sit down and eat.
Come on Novo, get up! I heard we
are immediately leaving for Neretva!
Let's go, get up!
Prozor has fallen.
You have to make a toast. Drink, brother!
You know, I was really worried
about you.
Take, people!
Brigade, attention!
-Novak.
Get lost!
Stipe, go.
-I understand, comrade commander.
I understand!
-Come on, let's go.
Squeeze girl,
I feel cold!
I haven't seen you for a long time uncle!
-Where do we know each other from?
From the faculty, uncle.
Welcome, comrades!
Long live Churchill,
Stalin and Roosevelt!
And you too, aunty.
-Help yourself, please.
Thank you, aunty
-And stay alive.
Why didn't you tell me
about Vuk?
Dana, what would Vuko say,
if he saw you?
You promised not to cry, if...
Let's join the round dance,
come on.
Come on, Stipe!
-I don't want to.
Come on, Stipe.
Come, commander.
-Just go.
What's wrong with him?
Nikola.
You have typhus.
Go to the hospital, immediately!
I can still dance.
Nikola!
You have to go to the hospital. -Ok,
if you give me my pigeons.
You'll get your pigeons.
Listen, take him to Marija.
Tell her to give him an injection .
I understand!
Hello!
Hey Italian, should I shorten
your head?
Comrade commander.
I have brought these two.
An officer and this fascist.
I'm not a fascist.
I'm a simple poor man.
You fascist and you officer,
how many partisans killed?
Mr.  commander, explain to them
that you think like they do,
otherwise they will kill us
without any reason.
Did you shoot at us?
-Yes, I did.
But I came to you
voluntarily. They didn't capture me.
You shot, therefor you are a fascist
like the rest of them.
Why didn't you come yesterday instead
of today, when Prozor fell?
Why?
And you say you can distinguish
a friend from an enemy?
I came, because I want to fight for
Italy without fascism.
If you accept me as one of yours, I will
loyally fight for your side.
I can't act anymore against my beliefs
and from now on I also won't.
Let's take him. We'll see...
Let's test him.
I don't want him in my unit.
You take him!
Do you speak French?
-Yes.
What's your name?
-Michele Riva.
What kind of weapon do you have?
What kind of cannons do you know?
Mostly light
artillery.
I'll take him into my division.
I need him.
Go ahead and take him.
Return the coat and the shoes to the captain!
-Comrade Martin.
But I have already been without shoes for
three months. -Take them off!
I am giving you the opportunity to
prove yourself in battle.
Thank you!
Venice? Florence?
Rome?
No, Parma.
And your occupation?
-I'm an engineer. And you?
Me, theater,
drama, Dalmatia...
Lovely.
Very pretty. - You Italians are
all Don Juans.
No, we're comrades.
And I also have a wife... married.
I'm married too.
Me... one child... four years.
General Lohring,
General Lohring!
General, strong partisan units are
advancing towards Jablanica.
They have cut me off from the back
part of my units.
I demand that our army attacks
from Konjic.
Immediately!
-On no account, Morelli!
There is no reason to panic,
calm down!
Their objective is not Jablanica.
They are coming after me, to Konjic.
Here they will set up a bridge
and get the wounded over the river.
I must tell you something
else.
Morelli, the "Weiss"
plan is not feasible anymore.
You must defend Jablanica by yourself.
I can't help.
And above all stay calm!
Over.
General Lohring,
general Lohring!
Comrade commander!
This fighter says that on the other side
of the fortress
there is an Italian ammunition warehouse.
We moved a cannon over there.
Excellent!
Let's go. -Follow me.
Ivan, Ivan,
here is the commander!
Novak, Danica.
Tell the fighters,
to withdraw from the fortress.
Quickly! -Ok, let's go!
Captain, fire on the ammunition
warehouse. Fire.
I can't.
I can fire on the Germans, I can't on
the Italians. They are my compatriots.
Fire, quickly!
Immediately!
Fire!
Get lost!
Get lost!
Get lost!
You're carrying your wounded, I don't
fire upon my soldiers.
Our morale is the same. Kill me,
if you want to, but I think like you do.
Get out of my sight!
What is it, Ivan?
There is no way I can hit the
window on the fortress.
The ammunition is there.
Give me a grenade!
Ivan, a grenade.
Comrade commander, this is...
He has golden trimmings.
Colonel, why didn't your surrender
immediately?
Danica, tell him that he is personally
responsible for the death of these soldiers.
I'm a general, not a colonel.
If the warehouse didn't explode,
you wouldn't have captured us.
I know what I can expect.
You think, we will shoot you?
Mr. general,
like all prisoners of war
you will also be carrying the wounded,
do you understand!
I'm a general,
not a beast of burden.
I would have your officer shot.
I don't expect anything else for myself.
Shoot me!
Novak, take him and keep an
eye on him!
And this handsome shall carry the
typhus people.
I understand, commander!
General...
Drago, maybe we can exchange
them for medicaments. -I understand!
Here.
Coat!
Take off your coat.
Faster!
For the partisans.
