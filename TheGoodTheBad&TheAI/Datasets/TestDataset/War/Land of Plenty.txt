These people might as well
be picking flowers.
Location secure.
Thank you!
Come on, people! Work with me!
-LAX?
Does that sound like a ''soft target''
to you? Nobody's going after LAX!
Ten-twenty.
North side of Palmetto.
l see an Arab.
Two very shady personages...
having a conversation where
they know they can't be recorded.
Two boxes are being held.
And the label reads...
Borax?
Two boxes of Borax.
ln pursuit!
Come on, baby...
Come on.
Come on, you crap! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Please!
Damn it! Shit!
Where the hell did he go?
What is he,
a magician or something?
Some kind of an invisible man?
Suspect fled on foot,
advanced into the...
maze of inner city structures
underneath the Fourth Street Bridge.
Vanished temporarily.
Pursuing on foot.
Talk about bad luck.
You think you slipped away?
Maybe for now,
but not for long.
You ran into a truck-load of the worst
luck you've ever had in your life...
turban boy!
Lana?
Hi!
l guess you remember me,
then?
No, not really.
No? Good! Because l was a nerd
back then and now l'm kinda cool.
You checked luggage, right?
No! No, this is it.
That's it?
All the way from Tel Aviv
and that's all you brought?
All my earthly possessions.
ls that true? Shall we?
l really appreciate
what you're doing for me here.
What do you mean?
You know what l mean.
Well, hey, whose life is it?
-Yours or your father's?
-lt's mine.
Well, then, there you go!
You think he'll send me
some hate mail?
Well, he might.
But at least you don't have
to worry about e-mail.
Cause he always says
that the computer is an invention...
that allows you to make more mistakes
in a shorter period of time...
Than every before in history.
-So, you heard that one from him?
-l heard it from him, alright, yeah.
Eighteen hundred hours,
El Monte airport.
No apparent security,
no nothing...
myself excluded.
l am observing approximately
forty to fifty private aircraft...
secured with padlocks.
Little kiddy locks!
My bicycle in high-school
was harder to steal.
You load these things up with
lsopropylmethylphosphonofluoridate...
hit any target in LA
in less than five minutes.
Just one rat,
that's all it would take.
Just one Mohamed Atta,
one Ziad Jarrah...
There are more homeless
and hungry in Los Angeles County...
than anywhere else in the States.
This is
''The hunger capital of America''.
l just had no idea!
l mean, the last thing that they're
talking about in the West Bank is...
is poverty in America.
The last thing they're talking about
in the ''West Wing''...
is poverty in America.
ls there no press?
No, it's all on lraq.
And if it wasn't that, they'd just find
something else to spin in its place.
Everyone buys it.
One big lie after another.
We handed the tents out
a few weeks ago.
Some wealthy woman bought a hundred
of them and brought them down.
l wish she'd come back
and bring some food.
lt's just too many!
We can't feed 'em all anymore.
How far are we from the mission?
You're just about to film it.
This is Lana.
l'll introduce you in the morning.
She's gonna be
with us a while, so...
she comes and goes
whenever she wants.
Night, Sherman.
God! That lock!
This is the men's dorm.
Most of the drug dealers
work the streets at night...
so we lock them out
and go to bed kinda early.
You're probably beat anyway?
Yeah...
l'm a little tired.
Come on!
Are you hungry?
No, not really.
Good! You'll do well here.
l like it.
Sure you do.
No, l really do.
You are going to do
very well here.
Bathroom is down the hall.
And this key unlocks your door...
our kitchen,
and a few other things.
lt would be bad to lose it.
We usually have tea around six.
That sounds good.
Okay.
Night!
Good Night!
Deedee mau!
That's it. Keep it coming.
-Just get out of my way.
-On your left.
-You got it! Keep it coming.
-Get the fuck out of my way!
You're veering! You're veering!
-Yeah, because of you!
-Watch the mirror!
What would l do without you?
There you go.
You got it.
More shredded paper? Great!
Can you reassemble it?
All of it?
Piece of...
piece of cake.
You got some more water.
-Where is it from?
-Read it!
What do you know about Borax?
Borax?
Yeah.
lt's a cleaning detergent,
isn't it?
l know it's cleaning detergent.
l wanna know what else
you can do with it.
What do you mean?
Like build a bomb?
-Just check it out.
-Alright.
l'll run it on the net.
What?
l was just thinking...
You know, everybody's
worried about a ''dirty bomb''.
Wouldn't it be funny
if it was made out of Borax?
During the day the second floor
is the real hub of activity, so...
we usually
leave this door closed.
Okay, got it.
Those are the women's dorms
down there.
Martha's jurisdiction.
-How you're doing, Marth?
-Hi, Henry?
You know, they've been
over capacity since, well...
since the last time
the fire marshal was here.
And we have a small room
for reading and prayer in there.
-And down here...
-l am sorry!
Come down here.
This is my office.
And then,
the real action is in here.
Café Maison.
-How's it flowing, Big H?
-Good.
-Sherman.
-Yes.
-This is Lana.
-Hi.
-Welcome to the mad house.
-Thank you.
-Help yourselves, fellows...
-Sherman is our operational manager.
And the chef.
And the janitor. And the accountant.
Hello!
Afternoon...
Elvin.
Afternoon. This your van?
Yeah.
Yeah, l like a little shade.
You PD?
Nope. But l was on a freedom bird
with one of your LTs.
Zucker?
Affirmative.
SSG Paul Jeffries, USASF.
You're working UC?
l'm working.
Excuse me, good morning,
good afternoon, whatever, but...
can l help you?
Hi. l am looking for my uncle
and l have this address.
-Your uncle? You got the wrong house.
-Paul... his name is Paul Jeffries?
No, no, no, never heard of him.
No!
l've been overseas for a long time
and l just got back into town.
And l'd really like to see him.
l kind of need to actually.
But the guy that lives here
doesn't have any relatives.
Well, he does.
He has one. lt's me.
Yeah, l was chubby.
So is there a way
that l can get in touch with him?
Cause l'm staying at a homeless mission
right now and l don't have a phone.
Look, you didn't...
you didn't get this from me, right?
Some little birdie told you.
Nineteen hundred hours,
evidence secured.
Will transport water samples
and report botulinum toxin analysis...
as soon as it gets back
from the lab.
Jeffries, out.
l'm good.
Damned!
Bread of Life.
Bread of Life?
How would l know?
Well, l don't know. What did they say
the last time you called?
Well, to tell you the truth,
l don't remember.
Lana? Lana who?
Lana Swenson.
What're your hours down there,
Miss. Swenson?
-Well...
-Your hours of operation?
the food service
and the sermons vary...
but the mission is pretty much
open all the time.
-Yeah.
Thanks.
l remember you, you know.
And l really wanna see you again,
Uncle Paul, even if...
Listen, l needed
some information, okay?
And you helped me out,
l appreciate that.
lf l can ever do anything for you,
let me know.
Fuck!
What's the matter, Jeffries?
Napalm getting to you?
Somebody get Polly here an APC
for his god-damn menstrual cramps.
Don't you get sick on me now,
Jeffries.
Charlie's not sick
hiding in that rat-hole.
There wasn't anybody sick
in Boston on September tenth.
l can guarantee that.
ln Washington and Newark...
they weren't sick and tired.
They were preparing...
god damn it!
Go ahead and laugh,
you fucking cowards!
Come on, laugh, you fucking,
lousy fucking Chuck.
You pull a box cutter on me,
motherfucker!
We'll see what happens.
Just one of those planes.
lf l had just been
on one of them...
Where the hell was everybody?
This country's been good to me.
This beautiful country...
Oh, God!
You know how scared l am.
l'm way out of my depths here...
yesterday l was still
in the West Bank, and then...
all of a sudden l'm here...
in my own country, but...
it feels so strange.
You gotta back me up
on this one, God...
even if l'm wrong...
l know that l need help.
l know that l can't do it
on my own.
l don't have to be afraid.
l know that You're with me.
And l know
that You're always there...
with Your arms
stretched out wide.
Thank You, God.
Thank You for this day...
for this room...
for my life. Thank You!
We're falling! We're falling!
How is it going?
Maybe we'll talk later.
Hey!
How're you doing?
What, you serve me a couple of meals
and now we're supposed to be friends?
Come on. Sure, why not?
But you don't even know my name!
ls that one of the rules
of friendship?
How can you be someone's friend
when you don't know what to call them?
Well...
l don't know,
but l bet you there's a way.
Charles, is this your drink?
What's so funny?
Nothing. But you're standing there
with your foot in your mouth.
So she knows my name.
Big deal.
Charles...
-How you're doing?
-How you're doing?
-l'm good.
-They call me Dee Dee.
Dee Dee, it's nice to meet you.
l'm Lana.
Nice to meet you, too.
-You got some meat in there?
-Right.
-There.
-Thank you, thank you.
This is no coincidence,
this is a sign.
Yeah. Or maybe... instinct.
Maybe is just pure instinct.
Thirteen-twenty six.
Suspect relocated:
Bread of Life Mission.
Still inside. l remain in position.
l got all day, pal.
You take your time in there.
Hello.
-l'm Lana.
-l'm Hassan.
Where are you from?
My home is not a place...
it is people.
Okay. Here we go.
Thirteen-forty eight.
Suspect engaged.
Standing on the northwest corner
of Winston and Los Angeles Street.
Under full surveillance!
Lead the way,
my little Pied Piper!
Lead the way.
He's got some more borax?
You got a lot of laundry, don't you?
So, you've ever been on a camel?
What?
ln Palestine, or wherever...
No, they have cars now.
That's where you're from, right?
Well, for the last
couple of years.
l was born in Ohio,
but l grew up mostly in Africa.
ln Africa?
My dad's a missionary.
So...
you've ever been on an elephant?
Suspect entered...
the Nidal Chemical
Bleaching Company...
at 645 lmperial Street.
That's an awful lot of barbed wire
for a bleaching company.
Bleaching.
Chemicals!
Hey, Boss.
Didn't you get the information
l printed out for you?
l put it in the envelope
next to your seat.
l haven't had time.
You know those printer cartridges
just aren't cheap!
l got one report out of Trinidad.
There's an lslamic military group there,
and they're threatening attacks...
on the UK and The States.
Chemical attacks!
-And?
Cobalt sulfate, but they're using...
they're using Borax.
Borax is definitely part of the mix.
Yeah, but l don't know if they use it
or if they're boiling it down...
for boron acid or what. You know,
there's four different kinds of boron.
Pentahydrate boron,
dexahydrate boron...
anhydrous sodium
sulfate boron...
Good! Good work, Jimmy.
l'll get back to you.
And there is one
other kind of boron...
Serge?
You're a busy little fellow,
aren't ya?
And l'm on you like glue.
Do we need the wars,
and the killing...
and the exploitation of man
by his fellow man?
Does God...
favor some people so he makes them
rich and powerful...
and we're the ones
who have fallen out of grace?
l wanna tell you right now, l have
some very good reasons not to think so.
Cause when Christ lived with us...
and he walked among us...
he preferred your company!
He would rather stay
with the outcasts...
and the whores and the underprivileged
than the rich and the hypocrites.
ln fact, when he sat at the table
of the wealthy, he couldn't even take it.
lt was an insult to him!
And that is where...
he told that story...
of a certain beggar,
a man called Lazarus...
who was on his knees at the...
at the gates of a mansion...
covered in sores...
asking for the crumbs that fell
from a rich man's table.
l know l'm missing
critical information right here.
Goddamn it! l can sense it!
Holy shit!
Let's move, let's move.
Bring him over here.
Right here, come on!
Come on! Hold on now!
Hold on, my brother.
Come on! Let's go,
put him right there.
Hold on! Hold on!
Sherman, call an ambulance.
Ann.
Lord, help us!
Ann, get me a towel, a bunch of them.
And water.
-Hold on, my brother! Hold on!
-Hollow point forty-four.
What?
The bullet explodes on impact.
lt tears a big hole in you.
So, what do we do?
You know CPR? Come on?
Ambulance is on the way!
Save me! Save me!
Tell me who it was.
Anything you can tell.
Just give me a name.
-Trona... Trona.
-Trona? Okay.
Just give me a name!
Any name!
What did he say?
ls he going to make it?
No.
What happened?
lt was a drive-by.
You look a lot like your mother.
What?
Especially your eyes.
On my bed,
at night l remember you.
And l think of you through
the watches of the night...
because you are my help.
l sing in the shadow
of your wings.
My soul clings to you.
Your right hand upholds me.
Holy father,
accept this soul into heaven...
with all your divine mercy
and love.
Amen.
Who's that man, Lana?
Perpetrators approached the kerb
in a black Humvee...
at twenty-two hundred
and twenty hours.
Conversation with the victim
was unrecordable.
However, within the Hummer,
l identified laughter.
Authentic laughter!
That's not ClA.
lt's definitely not DHS.
That's a negative.
They wanted to make a statement,
but not too big of a statement.
A hundred and twenty
thousand dollar vehicle.
Now where'd that money come from?
Saudi Arabia? Pasadena?
Either way, it's an Op.
A small elite cell
that was gonna start some trouble...
that was gonna screw something up.
They didn't wanna work
for Al Qaeda or Jemaah lslamiyah...
or whatever the hell, so the big boys
had to send them a message.
Yeah. But the big question is:
what is the big plan...
that the small plan
was gonna screw up?
That laughter sounded Arabic.
Definitely Arabic.
-What?
-Congratulations! What do you want?
Well, now is not a good time.
Who's Trona?
What'd you say?
Trona. l heard what that man said to you.
He said ''Trona''.
Listen, there is a lot more to this
than you think there is.
l met him in the food line today
and he told me his name...
Hassan.
Don't say anything else.
This is not a secure line, alright?
l'll come to see you tomorrow.
Time to make the donuts!
Now this is critically important.
Are you with me?
Yeah!
Okay.
Number one.
Crime scene?
l'll explain it later. But l need you
to make a dub of this tape...
and deliver to all four local networks
by o-nine hundred.
Can you handle that?
Of course, l can handle it.
Alright.
And then have this Arabic document
translated and analyzed...
ASAP.
l will do. Consider it done.
Good.
-By o-nine hundred.
-O-nine hundred.
l want you all to listen to this again.
Neither death...
nor life...
nor rulers, nor powers...
will separate you and me
from the love of God. You are loved.
When you're asleep
out there in the streets...
you are loved!
When you're collecting cans
for a nickel each, you are loved.
Wow!
ls this like
your surveillance vehicle?
lt's one of them, yeah.
Up, l got it.
Thanks.
Stand by...
September fifteen, eleven hundred o-six,
Paul Jeffries, USASF.
Update on the situation.
lndividual identified as Hassan.
Was that his first name?
First name is Hassan.
-You know his last name?
-No.
Further investigation needs to be
conducted before determining last name.
Okay.
So,
when you had this situation...
this dialogue, do you remember
exactly what was said?
Yeah.
Okay.
So, just start from the beginning.
Tell me word for word.
lt's very important.
l said ''hello'',
and then he said ''hello''.
Then l said ''l'm Lana'',
he said ''l'm Hassan''.
And then l asked him where he was from,
because he looked middle eastern.
What did he say to that?
He said
''My home is not a place, it is people''.
What the hell does that mean?
l mean, l don't really know.
-That was it?
-Yeah, yeah.
Then he took his food
and he walked away.
''My home...
is not a place...
it is people''.
That means...
his home...
is people.
Something like that. Okay!
-ls this for the Agent Orange?
-What?
Mom told me that
when you were in Vietnam...
that you had been exposed
to Agent Orange.
Well, your mom was wrong.
lt wasn't Agent Orange.
The Defense Department
called it Agent Pink.
But then they probably realized
it was too strong...
so they watered down the dioxin
and gave it a different name.
But l was around
before they did that.
-What did it do to you?
-Nothing, really.
Paul...
Listen, someone needs to figure out
who killed this guy.
lt's extremely important to me.
l can't do it sitting around here.
You've done well,
you've helped me.
l wanna keep in touch.
Hey, Alimi.
Yeah, yeah. Sure thing.
The ''business'' in question...
does not answer
their ''business'' phone...
during normal business hours.
l'm going in!
lf l was paranoid,
that would look suspicious.
Check for possible
one-man-submarine, out.
Fertilizer...
Oklahoma.
lt's being withheld because
they don't know what it is.
They'll figure it out.
They'll have fingerprints or something.
l'd say at least half the homeless
that die on the streets...
are never identified.
What happens to them?
They get cremated...
tossed into a mass grave
out at the county cemetery.
But he was murdered!
The least that they can do for him
is to find his family.
He deserves that much!
The truth is...
nobody really cares about him.
Bingo.
Hi boss, l got it!
The name of the company is...
lBC,
lnternational Boron Chemicals.
They pretty much built
the town of Trona themselves.
How far is it?
How far is it?
How far is it?
lt's...
it's about
a hundred eighty miles.
Anyway, the whole town
is built on a dry salt lake...
in Death Valley.
lt says that the company is digging out
all sorts of minerals and chemicals...
from the salt flats and turning them
into Boron products.
And get this.
They ship most of the stuff
to China.
-China?
-China.
-You said China?
-That's what it says.
What else?
Well...
it says that the area was originally
settled in 1870 by this guy John Searles.
His father was from Chicago
and he lived there.
ls the lake bed secure?
ls the factory secure?
Have there been
any reported break-ins?
Do any of the names look Arabic
in the telephone book?
How they transport the Boron
to the coast before it goes off to China?
Well, this is just a preliminary report.
l was gonna get into all that stuff.
Good. Because l'm going
there in the morning.
ls that stuff turning blue yet
in the test tubes?
That's gotta wait
at least a half hour.
That's right. You told me that.
-Are you okay?
-What do you mean?
l can see that your Agent Pink
is acting up.
lt's on your neck.
lt comes and it goes.
l can't stop it, you know that.
Yeah, but l also know that when
you get yourself too worked up...
-it just makes it worse.
-l'm not ''worked up''.
Alright.
l got you more meds
through the Canadian deal.
-They're in...
-We have a critical situation here.
We may be dealing
with the major cell.
Our work could be saving
thousands of lives, maybe more.
And you want me
to be calm right now?
Now is not the fucking time to be calm!
Okay?
Okay.
America needs us.
Jimmy, l'm gonna need you
for my C & C on this one.
lf l need tags pulled...
if l need to have a background check
or a favor pulled...
l need you to...
you need to stick by that phone.
lf l have to reach out...
l gotta know
you're gonna be there.
Alright, l'll be your REMF on this one,
Serge.
The phone will never ring
more than once.
They're trying to destroy
our country!
They're trying to infect us!
l am not gonna let 'em.
l am not gonna let them do it!
Do you want a...
a bottle of Tiger Piss?
Yeah... that sounds good.
-''Semper Fi.''
-''De Oppresso Liber.''
-l got a case inside the house.
-Good.
Okay. Just a minute.
Excuse me!
That was the drive-by killing
on Winston Street, right?
Right.
Still at the coroner's office.
He's been upgraded
from a John Doe, though.
lt says his name
is Hassan Ahmed.
A-h-m-e-d?
That's it.
Hassan Ahmed.
Thank you so much.
Any time.
You forgot your phone.
No, this is Jimmy.
-Hi, Jimmy.
ls my uncle there?
l need to talk to him.
Okay, well, how can l reach him?
'Cause l...
l have some information...
Really?
What case might that be?
The murder, Jimmy...
With Hassan and the Hummer.
Yeah.
He already left for Trona
and l guess he'd left his cell phone.
He left for Trona?
When you do talk to him, will you let him
know that l know who the victim was...
and that l need to speak to him?
Alright. l'll tell him.
Yusuf...
Paul?
Shit!
Give me a minute!
No other listing?
No, no, that's the only one
that l can find and it's disconnected.
l think...
l've got a number of a parish
in Ridgecrest.
lt's twenty miles from Trona,
so maybe they can send someone over.
-That'd be great!
-Yeah.
What day is it, anyway?
Alright!
Hi.
l needed to be somewhere today...
instead, l'm talking
to my twenty year old niece...
who all of a sudden wants
to become a private detective.
-l'm just trying to help.
-l don't need your help.
Where can we talk?
Should we go on the roof?
Good view point...
Okay, so what's his name?
-His name is Ahmed.
-Ahmed?
Yeah, and l talked
to his brother.
Excuse me?
Well, to his half-brother, actually.
And that's his only living relative.
You contacted his brother?
No. The morgue did.
Well, a parish from Ridgecrest actually,
but then the morgue, sort of.
And then he called...
he called Henry.
Lana, what the hell
are you talking about?
Well, they need help.
The LA morgue e-mailed
a photo of Hassan to Trona.
And his brother identified the photo,
but he doesn't have a car.
And Henry has offered
to pay for the burial...
but he only has a truck and
l don't think it's appropriate to...
l, now wait... Who's Henry?
He's the pastor from here.
You've entirely disrupted
this investigation!
l mean, you don't have a damn clue
what's at stake here.
Okay, l'm sorry,
l didn't mean to disrupt anything.
Okay, l thought that
this information would help you.
How's this supposed to help me?
Well...
the brother, l mean he might have
some information that you could use...
Yeah...
and if we would'a take
the body home...
then that might be kind of
a good cover for you.
A good cover?
That's great!
That's just... that's perfect!
lt all worked out.
Good.
Listen, l appreciate your help.
Likewise.
A lot of people
wouldn't take the time.
No, they wouldn't.
So, what've you got there,
a little flag?
That's right.
So, you're looking
after my niece?
Well, l just gave her a room.
She's pretty good
at looking after herself.
So, you're looking after her,
then?
Yeah, of course.
She's only twenty or so.
Over here!
-Wheel it in closer!
-ln there?
Yeah, in here. What'd you think?
We're gonna tie him up on top?
Okay, let's go!
l've never seen
a set-up like that before.
Excuse me!
You got everything?
No.
You're gonna need the coroner's report.
Did they put that in there?
Yeah.
-You're all set.
-Alright, thanks.
Touch base, if you can.
Just give me a call.
God speed.
l guess, you probably think l'm...
one of these vets...
that got all screwed up in 'Nam,
right?
-On the brink of insanity, right?
-No.
Nope.
l'd love you anyway though...
''Uncle'' Paul.
You want me to tell you something
about the Vietnam War?
Yeah.
We won!
The war?
That's right!
Metaphorically?
No, in actuality.
lt wasn't just
the Vietnam War, you know?
There was a little thing
called the ''Cold War'', too.
Right.
We stopped the spread of Communism
for ten thousand days.
We drew a line in the jungle...
and eventually they crossed it,
but when they did...
they were already depleted.
They were
completely exhausted.
lt was a critical time.
A critical place.
We won!
Uncle Paul...
can l ask you a question?
Sure.
What do you wanna know?
How come you never wrote
my mom back?
She sent you all those letters
over the years...
can you just tell me why?
l just never opened them,
that's all.
Why?
Well, it's hard to explain.
Listen, sometimes in life,
you just can't sit there, you know.
Sometimes
you have to make a break.
The only way to leave
something behind...
is to leave it all behind.
We didn't always see
eye to eye, you know.
All that fanatic
commie liberal stuff...
and dragging you around
to all those god-forsaken countries...
But l guess
she was a good mother.
She was.
She should have taught you
what America means.
What it stands for.
She did.
She taught me everything
that it's supposed to stand for.
l think that's the reason
l came back.
Supposed to?
We're in Trona.
Paul Jeffries,
September eighteen.
Heading north
on one-seventy-eight.
Now entering the town of Trona.
He lives in the trailer park.
But it doesn't say which trailer.
Excuse me, please.
We've arrived at position one,
the trailer park.
Outskirts of Trona, California.
Greenwich Mean Time
fourteen hundred hours...
Fourteen twelve!
What?
lt's actually fourteen twelve...
l don't know if that matters.
General time frame
is all l'm looking for.
Preliminary observation detects
inconsistencies, right off the bat.
There are approximately twelve
to fifteen dwellings in the compound...
yet for some reason
there are about forty mailboxes.
l'd like to see someone explain
that one.
Paul...
l was thinking
that it might be best...
if l went in and spoke to the family
while you took care of the body.
lf that's okay with you.
l just thought that it just might seem
a little bit strange...
driving there
with him in the back.
-lt's fine with me.
-Okay.
So why don't we meet
back somewhere over here...
when you're done
with the funeral home?
Sure.
Okay.
Great!
What do you think you're doing?
-What?
-What?
Does this look like
an amusement park to you?
Do you see any roller coasters?
l don't see any ferries-wheels.
l don't know what you mean.
Listen...
don't get delusions
or anything like that but...
you're not an operative on this.
But anyway...
l have some stuff here.
Police-issued pepper spray.
Don't point that
toward your face.
You may need this.
Do you really think
that l'm gonna need a flashlight?
And this.
lf you have to ditch everything,
you do not ditch this!
Alright, maybe
you don't need that.
Okay, channel three.
lt has a twenty mile range.
Now, you tell me you need me,
l'm there.
l'm your uncle...
but that part doesn't really matter.
You're on my Op.
-Remember, okay? You got it?
-Got it!
-l said three, right? Channel three.
-Channel three.
Okay.
Hello?
What?
l'm sorry, l don't mean to disturb you.
l'm looking for Mr. Ahmed.
What do you want?
l'm helping out with a family issue.
He's expecting me.
What? What's the matter?
Well, Mr. Ahmed,
l'm just trying to find his home.
l don't know anybody like that.
No!
ls he dark-skin?
Excuse me?
The dark-skin guy lives
in the last trailer up the hill.
The last trailer up the hill.
lt's Paul Jeffries.
Fourteen hundred
and twenty hours...
one hundred and eighty miles
from the epicenter of Los Angeles.
Striking distance,
but a world apart!
Trona. Look at this place!
A couple of pedestrians...
a few stool pigeons
sitting around without a clue.
But they're here!
Sleeper cells.
l can feel 'em!
Hello?
Massive numbers
of burned dwellings...
Completely... charred,
flamed to the ground.
At first pass l can determine
no clear pattern...
aside from arson.
Somebody lit these fires.
Probably to cover their traces.
l bet l'm being observed myself.
lt's just like in 'Nam.
Burnin' the damn Elephant Grass.
They know l'm here.
Somebody does.
Mr. Ahmed?
This is the body from Los Angeles.
Somebody is expecting it.
Me?
l don't know.
Are you expecting it?
-We use a gurney for that.
-Well, l don't really like gurneys.
And l'm on kind of a schedule.
What's the matter with you?
You've never seen a dead body before?
Put that thing over there
in that room.
l'm watching you.
Hello!
You are from the mission?
-With Henry?
-Yeah!
God bless you!
God bless you.
l am eternally grateful to you,
whoever you are.
-l'm Lana.
-And l am Joe.
-Nice to meet you.
-lt's good to meet you, Lana.
Let's see...
l have tea, water
and some very bad vodka.
Tea sounds lovely.
We'll have tea.
Come, go!
They just throw things out.
Perfectly good things.
Not in the mood for it anymore?
Trash it.
l'm gonna take it.
What is that?
Chemicals!
Located...
probable retired mobile...
chemical and or biological
manufacturing unit.
Going aboard.
Pistol targets!
Wood stove!
Strange green liquid.
Holy shit!
lt's Borax boxes!
Who is this?
Two new suspects
approaching in van.
They're getting out.
They're loading the boxes!
They're loading
the boxes into the vehicle!
Jesus! l go in
for closer observation.
Observe, track and report.
l just hold off for now.
Never interrupt the enemy
when he's making a mistake!
Just lay chilly...
wait it out.
Suspects fleeing.
l'm going for the van.
Got it!
Alright.
Let's look at these...
-Who is that?
-This is my father. And Hassan's father.
-Where was that picture taken?
-This is in Pakistan.
Look at his pants.
Funny, huh?
They're pulling out of town!
Going south now on one-seven-eight.
They're baiting me.
They think they're luring me in.
That'll be the day, my friend.
You back me into a corner...
and you'll rue that day,
Chuck.
You'll rue that day
for a long time!
He's turning left
into the side road.
Suspect vehicle parked
in front of isolated house.
That's perfect!
lt's a perfect sleeper hide-out.
Probably goes underground.
Probable chemical
weapons containers...
being transported into what
is most likely Trona headquarters.
Suspects out of view.
This is it!
You've done your job.
You've done your job well.
Every time l told you
to be patient...
and you wouldn't listen.
Well this is why.
You stick to your game plan,
you stick to your strategy...
and you never fluctuate.
And then you find yourself here.
These are the moments
that define your life.
My father and his brother...
at his brother's wedding.
And here is my mother.
Look at her!
This is a picture of Hassan
and me together, at his wedding.
Suspects loading full chemical containers
into cargo van.
License plate has been recorded,
clear photographs had been obtained.
lndividuals leaving the scene.
l will not continue
surveillance of the vehicle.
Repeat,
vehicle is free of observation.
SSG Jeffries, SSG Jeffries.
Copy?
S
l'm sorry.
S
S
That's my uncle.
S
S
SSG Jeffries. Copy?
This is L. Swenson reporting.
Copy. Yes, l have it.
lf you do not hear from me
within the next twenty minutes...
l want you to call that number.
lt will be forwarded
to an operative.
And he'll make arrangements for you.
Over.
What do you mean?
What arrangements?
ln the event l become indisposed,
he will transport you back to base.
To your mission. Over.
lf you become ''indisposed''
in the next twenty minutes...
l'm supposed to call a number
that will be forwarded to an operative?
No fucking way.
What?
No! Tell me where you are
and what the hell you're doing?
Wait, Uncle Paul, please...
l am not at liberty
to disclose this information.
And l also strongly suggest you refrain
from addressing me in that manner.
-Wait, Uncle Paul...
This is Staff Sergeant Paul Jeffries,
US Army Special Forces.
lt is seventeen hundred hours,
September eighteen.
l'm going in!
You dress funny.
But l guess you could say
the same thing about me.
Whatever is left to pack
is back there in the corner.
There should be some boxes.
For two months,
no one has been able to fix this.
l've been stuck on the same channel!
l can only control the volume!
Thank you, friend.
You're welcome.
You're in the shit?
No. l checked it out.
Those people are the wrong people.
A subdivision, maybe.
No. Go ahead.
They made an arrest
on the Humvee drive-by.
-Nothing yet.
You call me immediately.
What?
Your niece called me
on my line.
lt was forwarded from your phone
so l answered it.
l know how to handle that...
You know when to call me.
-Hi.
-Are you okay?
Paul, this is Hassan's brother,
this is Joe.
You brought my brother home.
l am always grateful to you.
Well, you're welcome.
Well, we're...
drinking some really bad Vodka.
Will you join us?
-Sure.
-Alright! Come, go!
Come in, come in, come in.
Paul, make yourself at home.
Please,
have a seat on the couch.
Paul? lt has been a long...
discussion in my family...
whether ''Aristocrat's Choice''
or lighter fluid...
is easier to swallow.
And lighter fluid lost,
but not by much.
Cheers.
How long has it been
since you talked to your brother?
Yes...
Really, it'd been a long time.
You don't have a telephone?
No.
Not any more.
How do you communicate
from here?
There is one pay phone
adjoining the gas station.
But l get no calls.
Except from Henry.
Paul... Paul?
What have you been doing
all this time?
What do you think l've been doing?
l've been trying to learn some...
stuff about Hassan.
l'll help you.
Anything l can tell you.
Anything l know.
Okay, well...
who'd wanna kill him?
No one.
No one?
No, if anyone knew Hassan,
had met Hassan...
they would wish him no harm.
Poor fellow had no possessions.
Nothing to eat...
nothing to steal...
He took a hollow point forty-four
right straight to the chest.
And that
doesn't exactly sound like...
a case of mistaken identity.
-Paul, can l talk to you for a second?
-Look, if you...
you need to give me something.
lf you want me to help you...
we can't play
this little game of riddles...
okay?
What was he making
with the Borax?
Borax?
Money!
He was trying
to make money to eat.
Okay, well that, good!
l can understand that.
He was trying to turn a profit so...
l'm gonna need to know
the source...
and l'll need to know
the buyers.
When the old factory shut down...
l was able to borrow a truck.
And l loaded it
with many boxes of borax.
Remind you,
l did not have permission...
Go on!
And Hassan...
he...
he found a company
in Los Angeles to keep it.
And he would try to sell it...
to other businesses and the company
would get some free boxes.
Free boxes to do what?
To clean their carpets.
They imported these carpets.
So...
how was he...
what was he... to get...
expecting from the other companies
that he sold to?
l don't know.
Whoever would give him
a few goddamn dollars.
lt's easier than selling cans.
What is that?
lt's just a photo of Hassan.
Excuse me, please!
Hassan.
Will you please tell me
what's happening?
l don't know.
l'm just... l'm not...
l can't follow the right leads.
You're okay?
l can't control it all, anymore.
My things, these things that...
You don't have to.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Go ahead?
Go ahead.
Yeah, l heard you.
Completely non-related.
Zucker said
they got a legit confession.
Some random act.
A couple of white kids?
Where did they get the Hummer?
They also got a match
on the gun...
and Zucker said they tested
positive for Crystal Meth.
And one of them for Crack.
Listen. l got to...
l'm working on something.
l'll contact you later.
Good work, Jimmy.
l can't believe the situation here.
Paul.
My God, Uncle Paul!
Come here! Are you okay?
Just, minor injuries.
-l'll take a butterfly stitch.
-l'm getting you a wash cloth.
Leave the quack in the tent.
He couldn't stitch a baseball.
Shit!
That is...
it's probably the worst day...
We're hot!
We got hit on the left!
Left side! Left side!
-Uncle Paul!
-Pull it up, pull it up.
Little John! Pull it!
Pull it up, little John!
Pull it up!
We're gonna fucking dive!
You wanna mess with me?
Okay, let's go!
Let's go, you fucking...
You fucking gooks! Let's go!
Come on,
you fucking little gooks!
No, my God, we got flamed!
We got flamed in the bird. What?
We're in deep shit!
ln deep shit!
Rip the belt! No!
God!
Don't! No, don't.
We're jumping.
Please, don't, don't, don't.
You had a horrible dream
last night.
lt really scared me.
l'm sorry.
You said that you were falling.
Do you remember?
That was the Huey l went down in.
We all fell.
Only two soldiers walked away.
l was one of 'em.
lt's a gift.
A gift?
l'm not so sure about that.
lt is to me.
That dream went away
for a long time.
And then,
when that plane hit the tower...
and then a second one...
but they were still there.
l was watching that shot
of the New York Skyline...
with those beautiful towers.
They were burning inside...
but they just kept holding on.
Right there.
l knew it was bad.
Over two thousand gallons
of fuel...
two seven-sixty-sevens...
but l thought
they could handle it.
They took the blow
and they were standing strong...
and l thought...
''They're refusing to fall!
They're too proud''.
But then...
that dream
just started coming back.
l was so far away
that it was night time...
when the towers fell.
And at first, l didn't...
l didn't know what was going on.
l just heard people...
cheering.
Cheering?
There was a crowd gathered out
in the street. Close to where we lived.
Terrorists?
No.
No, l think that that's the part
that hurts the most.
They weren't...
they were just...
just ordinary people.
Well, why in the hell
were they cheering?
Because they hate us.
And because they hate America.
And it came from such
an honest place...
and from so many people that...
l just, l knew that something
had gone wrong...
and...
and that's...
that's become my nightmare.
Over three thousand civilians
were killed on that day...
they were innocent people!
Yeah. And...
and it's their voices
that l need to hear.
'Cause l really don't think they'd want
any more people killed in their name.
You seem disappointed.
l thought it'd be different.
Like what?
Something more!
l don't know...
not just a construction site.
Let's just be quiet!
Let's just try and listen...
