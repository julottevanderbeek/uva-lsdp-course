LO N G LIVE DEATH!
After capturing and disarming
the Red Army today...
official troops reached
their final obje ctiv e.
The war is ov er.
Traitors will be
relentlessly hunted down.
If ne cessary,
we will kill half the country.
Long liv e Death!
Papa, I don't want them
to kill you!
You'll die, too?
- Yes.
- What'll I do?
You'll be grown up by then.
I don't understand.
We must all die.
- When we die, is it fore v er?
- Yes.
But what about heav en?
That'll come later.
- I'll bring you flowers.
- When?
When you die.
I'll bring you poppies.
- Don't think about that.
- Why not?
Be caus e...
All right.
Will we meet in heav en?
Yes.
That's good.
- Who inv ented it?
- What?
H eav en.
Nobody.
And the rest?
What "rest"?
Death.
Nobody.
Then when you die,
your belly'll be my drum.
Don't say that.
Is it a sin?
No.
My son, when you feel
the prickings of the flesh...
put on a hairshirt
and say an "Our Father."
A package came for you.
For me?
Pri-son.
Remember your papa.
U ncle, I need your advice.
My husband's
be come a renegade,
endangering his family's future
with his awful progressiv e ideas.
I think it's my duty to turn
him in to the authorities...
so he'll be
arrested right away.
...arrested right away...
arrested right away...
Fando,
that's my Dr. Plumb pipe.
Yes, Dr. Plumb.
It's the only pipe I smoke.
Can I s ee it?
You can.
It's hot!
There.
You're under arrest
for military re volt.
If he knew
who turned him in!
Smash the bastard's
brains out!
The prison dire ctor
informs you
your husband is under
"spe cial surv eillance."
For plotting against
the established order...
he's to be "punished"
and placed in solitary.
Who did the y take?
Where's Papa?
The window!
The neighbors'll s ee us!
Where's Papa?
Is he dead?
Is he aliv e?
H is political ideas
hav e ruined your future and his.
Forget your father.
H e was a Red...
and an atheist.
- Didn't atheists kill Jesus?
- Yes.
- Don't Reds burn churches?
- Yes.
- I'll be atheist when I'm big.
- No!
- I'll be a Red.
- No!
You're a good boy.
The y take away his red flag.
H e can't walk good 'caus e
my theater's made of wood.
The y put Papa in jail.
The y lock the door.
Papa asks to s ee me,
but the judges say
he doesn't des erv e to.
So Mama goes
to s ee him in prison.
She puts on her shawl.
She goes slow
'caus e she's afraid
of dogs and vultures.
She reaches the prison.
She s ees Papa.
She tells him to suffer
'caus e he's been such a coward.
The judges come
and take Papa out of jail...
but he's brav e
and keeps his pipe.
With a big knife
the y cut off his head.
Come on,
time to go to sleep.
Are you coming?
Let's go, son.
Why the muzzles?
To keep them
from eating the grapes.
Down with muzzles!
Down with muzzles!
Assassins! Assassins!
All towns hav e fallen,
the war's ov er.
Our greatest fas cist victory!
Last week...
our troops hit
the capital
from the right, left and center.
Fighting was desperate
and raged on...
till the heights at each end
of the front were occupied.
Enemy loss es...
were disastrous.
Constant bombing
threw the enemy in disorder...
cutting off all retreat.
A total Red defeat
was imminent.
Our heroic tanks and trucks...
rushed into the fallen capital
as the y did into all the Red cities.
The chief
of state de clared:
The bastard reign of liberal
and socialist whoring...
is dead, killed
by our v aliant army.
The Nation has slain
the anarchist dragon...
who now lies biting the dust.
Bless ed by the Holy Church,
the army has the reins
of power fore v er.
Air raids soon de cimated
the republican air corps.
H ere a Red pilot
parachutes from his plane...
the last one shot down
before the war's end.
Is the sky-man an angel?
Not so loud!
Don't you lov e me?
Oh, y es, you're
the most beautiful mama...
of all the world's
towns and provinces.
Prettier
than the church's Virgin.
Get up! After your bath
we're going to the cemetery.
Stop it!
I'm hot, I'm hot.
Be quiet!
Come on, Theresa.
Ready!
Let the exe cution of thes e Reds
be an example. Long liv e death!
Fire!
I'm sav ed! I'm not dead! Sav ed!
It's the poet.
The faggot.
A faggot.
Finish him off up the ass.
Left face!
Shoulder arms!
Forward march!
The y'v e killed
Frederico Garcia Lorca.
We must trust God
and respe ct H is wishes.
Yesterday you saw how H e punished
thos e who burn churches.
And the poem
for your mama?
Mama is
the prettiest flower.
Good. Then what?
...prettiest flower.
And I lov e her more each hour.
Does it rhyme?
It's too prosaic.
God s ees us and is always
watching ov er us.
E v en when we're
on the toilet?
Arms like a cross
and 2 dictionaries!
Get your cripple goin'!
Get him out there!
Go!
Look at him go,
he's a champion!
Mine'll piss in
your champion's e y e!
My turtle's got no cock
and no balls either!
If your grand'ma
heard ya!
Holy Mos es!
Let's go!
The y'll beat us up!
Go on! Kill 'im!
Knock his teeth out!
Bastard!
Red!
Son of a Red! Red!
Red! Red!
Son of a Red!
Come, Fando.
U s e the hall.
Don't be afraid of the dark.
Go on.
You said
a bad word today?
Who squealed?
I know what you said.
Giv e me your finger.
That'll teach you
not to say that.
This kid's
a little girl.
Wears his spigot
on the right, not left.
You can s ee
his pa wasn't a Christian.
My pa made me walk alone...
in the dark...
with a torch. Awful shadows
danced on the walls.
I wasn't afraid.
You're just a wet hen,
a coward.
H igh time you looked
after yours elf.
Afraid of the dark.
H is spigot on the right.
I'm not a chicken.
You'll s ee!
Fando, get down.
You'll kill yours elf.
Fando,
you'll kill yours elf!
Gran'pa is v ery sick.
You must be brav e.
Peace on this hous e
and family. Amen.
The Lord forgiv es you
all sins committed...
by s cent...
by the ears...
the heart...
and all adv ances.
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost, so be it.
Come, holy saints and angels...
Take his soul
and pres ent it to the Most H igh.
May Christ who called you
now re ceiv e you
and the angels lead you
to Abraham's bosom.
Take his soul
and pres ent it to the Most H igh.
Come kiss your gran'pa
who's just died.
By this holy agony
and in H is sweet mercy,
may the Lord pardon you all sins
committed with your e y es.
Pleas e, Lord, hav e mercy
on our departed grandfather.
Don't punish him
for his deeds...
for he meant
to do Your will.
As true faith bound him
to the Belie v ers here...
now may Your mercy place him
in the choir of angels on high.
Don't stand there, come in.
Ask for mercy.
Pray with me.
May God keep granpa's soul...
and not punish him
for his deeds.
We must make a sacrifice
so he can go to heav en today.
Beat me!
Faster!
Harder!
I'm sorry.
I didn't wanna hurt you.
You're my only friend.
You're not like Aunt Clara.
H it him once!
The other hand.
All right.
Harder.
That's enough.
It's not your turn.
Once.
- Once, but hurt him!
- Damn!
Your turn now.
H urry up!
Go on, a hard one.
Good! Not bad.
The little ol' priest...
oughta bless your whip.
Cut his nuts off!
Put 'em in his mouth, dirty priest.
Cut off his balls!
Cram 'em in his trap!
Oh, my balls!
How tasty the y are!
Thank You, Lord,
for this divine dish.
God, You gav e them to me
and took them away.
Bless ed be Your holy name.
Light trav els at 186,390 mps...
less than 1 s e cond
to go around the equator.
Most stars' light
takes y ears to reach us.
The North Star
takes about 40 y ears.
With a huge teles cope,
the y calculated the distance...
to a star millions
of miles away.
This star's light takes
We s ee it now as it was
Its light existed
before the pyramids.
For centuries
and centuries...
Into the clos et
with the rats!
The maquisards again!
It's the terrorists!
It's the Reds!
Why don't you e v er talk
to me about Papa?
Why should I
make you suffer?
Why talk about
your Papa?
Why tell you
he was a traitor?
Thrown into prison, that he e v en
tried to commit suicide?
I sacrificed my whole life for you
and this is the thanks I get.
You must belie v e me.
Your father is dead.
Where're you going?
Come here!
Fando!
Go on,
kill him!
What're you doing here?
Maybe my father's here.
H is name's Tosan.
Sure, sure,
I remember him.
So you're his son?
Where is he now?
Better ask the court.
H e tried to commit suicide.
We're inv estigating
your father.
When we learn something,
we'll notify your mother.
What's he got?
Lung trouble,
as if the air here stifles him.
My poor baby.
Madame,
your son has TB.
H e must be s ent
to the clinic boat.
Burn his theater.
It's contaminated.
I'm sick, maybe I'll die.
I'v e got to find Papa.
I got Pa's Dr. Plumb
and some shag.
I put some orange peel
in the pouch y esterday.
Today the tobacco
feels fresh.
Since the pipe's s easoned,
when it goes out...
it giv es off
a nice smell.
It's Papa's
Dr. Plumb pipe.
Maybe it was on his table
when he tried to commit suicide.
The treatment
began 6 months ago.
There's no
improv ement at all.
The cavity is wors e.
We'll hav e to operate.
Tomorrow you'll be
operated on at the hospital.
Did you turn him in?
Not so loud.
People can hear us.
You turned Papa in?
I only told the truth.
If he'd confess ed,
the y'd hav e gone easier on him.
Thanks to my testimony...
and my submissiv e attitude...
the y were more
indulgent with him...
but he insulted me
and said I'd betray ed him.
All my life he repaid
my goodness with e vil.
Colonel...
my husband's been corrupted
by progressiv e ideas.
H e's an enemy
of the nation.
As a soldier and a man
your duty is...
to pre v ent him
from further endangering...
his wife,
children and country.
Arrest him.
- Did you help him in prison?
- I couldn't.
I suffered
more than him.
Why do we always talk
about the past?
We can't do anything
to change it.
I wish
you'd stop worrying...
and forget
the unhappy past.
Why was he
in a mad cell?
How'd you know that?
H e didn't go mad in prison.
H e always was.
If not, how could he hav e
committed all thos e sins?
May God keep me from speaking
ill of my belov ed husband.
H e tried
to commit suicide.
I should'v e been the one.
I could'v e
gone crazy with pain...
but I had to stay sane
to look after you...
and get you
out of this mess.
I'v e failed.
A lifetime of sacrifice
for nothing!
I had to turn him in
for your good...
Your own good.
But now he's dead.
No, he's not dead.
I hav e proof for you.
The pipe your father
always smoked.
It was in his jacket
pocket the day...
he was exe cuted.
H ere's where
the bullet hit it.
It's proof
he's really dead.
That, Fando...
is my Dr. Plumb pipe.
Dr. Plumb?
Yes, Dr. Plumb.
It's the only pipe I smoke.
You'v e already
grown up, son.
Cut off
your father's balls.
Fando! Fando!
Your father's es caped
into the maquis.
Come on,
we'll look for him.
Traitors will be
relentlessly hunted down.
If ne cessary,
we will kill half the country.
Long liv e Death!
