The operation goes under
the name of Freshman.
sent into the mountains
in two gliders,
each pulled by a Halifax bomber. 21
men in one glider, 20 in the other.
Now, the Halifaxes take them
as far as the Norwegian coast,
then the gliders swoop down,
unnoticed, and land on high ground.
After that, our chaps
slip down to the factory
- and blow the damn thing to pieces.
- It's quite a big area.
Yes, we'll need people
who can establish depots,
do reconnaissance,
men who know the area and of
course speak the language.
A welcoming committee of
Norwegians sent out ahead.
- What do you want me to do?
- Find them. Create an operations unit.

Wilson's office.

- Meeting room.
- Ma'am.
- George.
- Yes, ma'am?
Um, my office.
Radio room, tea room, your office.
The Germans have apparently searched
both your office and your home.
It appears you didn't
leave a moment too soon.
Your wife and children are safe,
they're with the in-laws.
Maybe it would be a better solution
if my family came here.
- That's not an option.
- They won't be any trouble.
Do you see any children
here, Mr Tronstad?
They've been evacuated
so they don't get bombed.
Norway may have been invaded
but it's still a far safer
place than England.
You obviously don't have children.
So how long have you known about
the Germans' atomic programme?
Well, that depends on what
you mean by "known".
Since Poland there's been no
information on anything that
smells of Wissenschaft
which is strange
but I suppose that no information at
least leaves room for speculation.
DISTANT GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSION
So, these are all
Norwegian volunteers?
They keep coming. Hundreds of them.
They sign in there and we
put them straight to work.
- Who's that?
- Hm?
The redhead.
Skinnarland. Eenar.
Einar.
Einar.
He came in this morning. Hijacked
a boat with some other lads.
- I've seen him at the factory.
- You have indeed.
You must go!
- No!
- No! Jump!

It's so good to be here.
- I'm sorry I couldn't
make it to the conference.
- No-one did.
There wasn't a single scientist
worth mentioning in the room.
- I was expecting at least...
- Not because of you.
Everybody wanted to see you.
You know, let's go for a walk.
You are being bugged?
Oh, yeah. We discovered it a couple
of months ago. But it's all right.
- All right? It's awful.
- Well, you just have to
think before you talk.
Which, actually, isn't
such a bad idea.
- The Institute, as well?
- Yes, everywhere. But it's...
I mean, out here, it's OK.
What?
I don't know...
.. I don't know how much you know.
Times are changing, your regime.
Yes, I've noticed.
Don't you miss the old days working
at the Institute together?
Oh, yes, I certainly do.
Copenhagen is not so far from Berlin.
The thing is, I'm... I'm
not allowed to say anything.
I was even asked to find out about
your position with the Brits!
I don't care about those things.
Politicians come and
go, majorities change,
but science only moves forward.
One discovery leads to the next.
I'm not trying to sway
you in any one way.
But the project I'm working on
is just, everybody's winning.
With money. Resources.
It's not just a little department or
an institute, it's bigger than that.
I want this to happen.
Finally, it's under my control.
As long as we let the war serve
the science, there is no danger.
Imagine everything we can do.
- Pull out of it.
- Huh!
What?
Pull out of the whole damn thing.
- Is it the Brits?
- What?
Have you been briefed by the Brits?
No, no, no, no, no.
They have absolutely nothing
to do with this whatsoever.
I'm the one who's telling you.
You work for them.
I thought I came to see a friend.
Well, I'm still your friend.
- You don't understand what I'm talking about.
- I don't understand?
No.
Now, do you get it?
Yes.
I get it.
You've always asked me which
moral obligations we have.
Well, here's my answer.
Our obligations have
never been bigger.
- Yes, but as scientists...
- Cut the crap.
- Crap?
- Yes, crap. You know exactly
what I'm talking about!
You're working for the German army.
Come on, which planet are you
on?! They've hired you. Why?
To front German culture?
To see you make some interesting
calculations on a blackboard?
No, they've hired you because
they want something in return.
They want value for
their money. Results.
And ideally, something that explodes.
Listen.
We are working with creating energy.
Our moral obligations have never
been bigger than they are now.
And if you don't understand that...
.. then you are either
stupid, or very naive.
And right now, both of them
are equally dangerous.
Let me give you one
last piece of advice.
As your friend.
Don't ever tell anyone
that you asked me
to be a part of your programme.
Now, would you care
to join me for dinner?
My wife would be happy to see you
and she's longing to hear
you playing the piano.
I will sit there and I will eat
and, of course, I'll applaud.

They're ready.
Being enthusiastic is not

Wanting to do something is not the

And being hungover is
not being fit to fight.

I pity the husband.
Her husband went down with HMS
Prince of Wales last December.
Sunk with the Japanese.
He's still missing.
She works a lot.

- Absolutely.
- Sooner or later.
One hopes sooner.

You can't, Tronstad.
OK, they can go without him.
All right. It's your decision.
