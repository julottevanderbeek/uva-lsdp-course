Vast and deserted
are the lands of Central Asia.
Your master ready
to go to the market?
Master is sick.
The flag indicates...
...that praying for the health
of the yurta's owner are...
...a lama...
...a learned monk-healer...
...and a collector of taxes
for the monastery.
Very sick!
My son will go to the market...
The son.
Get ready to go to the market!
Saddle the horse!
Furs for sale.
A fine skin!
We'll get flour!..
We'll eat well
every day!..
Five hundred silver coins.
For healing the body...
...and the soul...
...a feasible reward.
Not enough!
Not enough!
The lama lost...
...a sacred amulet.
For the road.
Marketplace.
THOSE who buy for pennies...
...and gain millions.
THOSE who guard...
...the capital's interests.
A wonderful fox for sale
in the marketplace...
Furs are bought up here.
We'll eat
every day!
Next!
Give back my fox!
LET GO!
A WHITE MAN'S BLOOD
HAS BEEN SHED!
Go away!
Run!..
If in 24 hours...
...the criminal is not
delivered to the authorities...
...all population...
...will be exemplarily punished...
...and fined.
To the taiga.
In 1920...
...in the mountains...
...for the power of the Soviets...
...partisans were fighting.
They're closing in!
We got to go!
Must try to break through!
They're closing in!
The commander.
A miner
from the faraway Donbass.
Without any noise...
An accidental witness.
Thank you, comrade!
Watch out!
WATCH OUT!

We got to run!
No horse.
Get on!
Camp.
Maintain communication...

Listen to...
...Moscow.
Listen to...

To strengthen
ties with the population...
...the chief of occupation...
...and his wife...
...with the staff...
...are going to visit
a big monastery.
Diplomacy demands...
...special forms...
...and preparations.
Before leaving.
The chief ordered
to quickly collect
two hundred heads of cattle
from the nearest settlements.
Set out immediately!
It's a long way from the city
to the monastery...
The ties are planned.
The ties are worked out
by diplomacy.
The ties are strengthened
in practice.
Ride and tell them
that the soldiers are coming...
SACRED DANCES.
Before the sunset, gather here
all the driven-away cattle!..
...or...
By the animal trail.
Be prepared...
...to speak
on behalf of the Empire...
...with the great,
immortal lama...
...whose soul is forever passing
from a dead body to a new one...
BE PREPARED!..
...Himself...
...The great...
...IMMORTAL...
...WISE...
LAMA.
The lama's soul recently
moved to a new body...
Although the Great One doesn't speak,
he understands everything.
Diplomacy demands
mutual respect.
My government sincerely regrets
your recent passing away...
...and gladly welcomes
your new reincarnation.
The road is dangerous...
...the Reds showed up...
leave immediately...
The Empire is confident of the strong
friendship of the Mongolian people.
We will hope...
...for the reciprocal observance
of our common interests.
You have to hurry...
very dangerous...
In case of an encounter
with the friendly people.
Calm down!..
They're ours.
In view of a serious danger
we sent a convoy.
A Mongolian partisan
has been caught...
This is what we found on him.
Are you a partisan?
A Red one?
Moscow?
Shoot this beast.
Take him out of town and shoot him.
Interpreter.
This is either a code,
or is written in an ancient language
that I can't understand...
A missionary specializing
in the ancient Mongolian language.
This is...
...an absolutely
extraordinary document!
The deed indicates
that its owner...
...is a direct
heir to Genghis Khan!
Bring him back!
Bring him back!
Maybe he's alive!
There is no body!
Alive, alive!..
ALIVE!
Gentlemen!
We must do
everything possible...
...to be able to take advantage
of the lucky find.
We'll make him
the ruler of the country.
Through him
we'll strengthen our power.
Let's try!
We'll get support!
Ready!
Long live...
...Asia...
...under the powerful
patronage of the king!
The ruler is getting better.
We're training the soul
of the future ruler.
Explain to him
that he became famous.
Translate that the messengers
of sovereign princes are here.
My prince...
...sends his submissiveness...
...and two thousand horsemen.
It looks like we got it well in hand?
He's thirsty.
The ruler has recovered.
Let him take a walk.
Tell him that
tonight we'll demonstrate him.
From the depth of the country,
after a successful trade...
...at last...
To his cultured
compatriots.
The master isn't home.
Hey, anybody here?
The lieutenant is at the Assembly.
Change and come here.
Just a minute...
At the Assembly.
A daring hunter...
...FROM THE WILD STEPPES...
...With a skin of a killed animal...
We brought him.
I demand...
...that the honour of white people...
...be protected from the encroachments
of colored scoundrels.
By the power invested in me...
...I ORDER...
...you...
...TO LEAVE!
It's necessary to prepare...
...for the ceremonial meeting and...
...the announcement of the agreement.
Paragraph four.
The ruler of the country
binds himself to let us have...
...the best goods
at a minimal price...
The Empire binds itself...
...to bolster his power...
...to indefatigably care
for the people's welfare...
Add: piously
observing mutual interests...
THE ARRESTED MAN
IS IN THE BASEMENT.
But I gave an order...
Piously observing
mutual interests.
Me not shoot!..
NOT SHOOT!
NO.
SHOOT HIM!
He's biting!
DEVIL!
SHOOT.
SHOOT NOW!
SORRY, MADAME!..
Down with the robbers!
Down...
...WITH THE BANDITS!
DOWN...

To arms!
CATCH HIM!
DESTROY HIM!
DOWN...
...WITH THE WATCH...
...DOGS...
...OF IMPERIALISM!
