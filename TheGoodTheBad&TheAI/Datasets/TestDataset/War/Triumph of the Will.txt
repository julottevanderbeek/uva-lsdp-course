I open the Congress
of the Sixth Party Day...
in respectful public memory of...
General Field Marshal
and Reich President Von Hindenburg...
who has passed into Eternity.
The General Field Marshal is remembered
as the first soldier of the Great War.
And thoughts as well
to our fallen comrades.
I greet the high representatives
of foreign states...
who by their presence are participating
in this day for their political parties.
In sincere friendship the greeting
of the Movement is extended...
especially to the representatives
of the Armed Forces here,
now under the orders of the Führer!
My Leader:
Around you stand the flags and standards
of this National Socialism.
Only when they are threadbare...
will the people
be able to understand...
by hindsight,
the greatness of our time...
because ofwhat you, my Leader,
mean to Germany!
You are Germany!
When you act, the Nation acts.
When you judge, the People judge.
Our thanks is the vow
to stand with you...
in good days and bad...
come whatmay.!
Reich MinisterDr. PaulJosefGoebbels
Thanks to your leadership, Germany
will be attainable as the homeland.
Homeland for all Germans in the world.
To us you were the guarantor ofvictory.
To us you are the guarantor of peace!
Adolf Hitler: Hail Victory.!
Hail Victory.!Hail Victory.!

Adolf Wagner, GauleiterofMunich-Upper

&SA-Obergruppenführer
No revolution
that seems to be permanent...
can lead to anything other
than complete anarchy.
So the World will not live at war.
So also the people
do not live on revolution.
Nothing on this earth that has lasted
for thousands ofyears...
was assembled in mere decades.
The largest tree also has
the longest period of growth.
What braves the centuries...
will also be strong
through the centuries.
AlfredRosenberg, Reichsleiter
andlaterReich Minister
forannexedEastern Territories
It is our unshakeable belief
in ourselves...
that is our hope for the youth...
to carry on the work which has been put
before them in the stormyyears...
of the revolt of 1 91 8 in Munich...
and which is already part
of the entire German nation's history.
Dr. Otto Dietrich, Reichsleiter
andReich Press Chiefin Ministry
ofPeople EnlightenmentandPropaganda
Truth is the foundation...
on which the power of the press
stands in the world.
And that it reports the truth
about Germany...
is the only demand that we place
on the foreign press.
DrFritz Todt, Reich GeneralInspector
ofHighwaysandConstruction
andMinisterofArmamentsandMunitions
As I speak, work on the Reich Autobahn
has begun at 51 locations.
Although this work
is in its early stage...
today there are already
and another 1 00,000...
engaged in the work
of allied industries.
Fritz Reinhardt, State Secretary
in the Reich MinistryofFinance
andSA Obergruppenführer
Wherever we look,
all around there is building...
and new creations...
and activity and life...
which will continue into the future.
Richard-WaltherDarré,

Central Office ofRace andResettlement
Maintaining the health of our farmers
is the primary foundation...
for the prosperity of industry...
for German business
and for foreign exports.

A people that does not protect
the purity of its race, goes to seed!
Dr. Robert Ley, Reichsleiter
andHeadofthe German LaborFront
All our work must be dictated
by a single thought--
that the German worker...
be made an upright, proud
and equally entitled national comrade.
Dr. Hans Frank,
Reichs MinisterofJustice andlater
GovernorGeneralofoccupiedPoland
As the Leader
of the German legal service...
I can say that, clearly, the basis
of the National Socialist State...
is the Nationalist Socialist Law Code.
And forus ourhighestleader
isalso the highestjudge.!
We know how sacred the principles
of these laws are to our Führer.
These Reich laws can assure you,
National Comrades...
that your life and existence is safe
in this National Socialist State
of Order, Freedom and Law.
Dr.JosefGoebbels, Reich Minister
ofPeople EnlightenmentandPropaganda,
GauleiterofBerlin...
andlater
GeneralPlenipotentiaryfor Total War
May the bright flame of our enthusiasm
never be extinguished.
It alone gives light and warmth...
to the creative art
of modern political propaganda.
This comes
from the depths of the People...
and from these depths of the people...
it must always again
find its roots and its strength.
It may be good to possess power
based on strength...
but it is better to win
and hold the heart of a People.
Konstantin Hierl, Reichsarbeitsführer,
Headofthe German LaborService
Today, the German people
are spiritually and soulfully ready...
to undertake their obligation
in the general Labor Service.
We have the Führer's orders!

Germany.!
Today we work together...
in the swamp.
We work in the swamp.
And in the sand.
We dam the North Sea.
We plant trees.
We build roads...
from town to town,
and city to city.
We provide the farmer
with new soil...
forests and fields,
land and bread...
forGermany.
We didn't stand in the trenches.
Nor were we
under the shell fire of grenades...
and still we are soldiers.
Sharpen the hammers...
axes, pickaxes
andspades.!
We are the Reich 'syoungmanhood.!
As once at Langemarck...
at Tannenberg...
before Lüttich ...
before Verdun...
on the Somme...
on the Ähne...
in Flanders...
in the West...
in the East...
in the South...
on land, on water,
and in the clouds.
Comrades, who were shot
by the Red Front and Reactionaries...
You are not dead.!
You live in Germany.!
My Labor Service Men.
For the first time you are presented
for review in this forum...
before me
and before the German people.
You represent a great idea...
and we know that for millions
of our national comrades...
physical labor will not longer
be a divisive concept.
But it will instead bind us together
and, furthermore...
no longer will it be the case
in Germany...
that physical labor will be seen
as anything less...
than any other work.
The whole nation passes
through your school.
The time will come
when no German...
can be admitted
into the community of the people...
until he has first become a member
ofyour group.
And you know that today
you are not only being seen...
by the thousands in Nuremberg,
but by all of Germany...
which also sees you here
for the first time today.
And I know thatjust as you serve
this Germany proudly...
all of Germany today will see its sons
marching in you with proud joy!
ViktorLutze, S.A. ChiefofStaff
atSA Night Rally
Hail Victory!
Hail Victory! Hail Victory!
Comrades.
Many ofyou here tonight knew me...
as an SA man...
marching in the rank and file...
in the first years of the Movement.
And Party Comrades,
just as I was an SA man then...
so I am still an SA man today!
We SA workers will always be true
only to the Führer...
and fight for the Führer.

My Leader!
My Comrades!
We live again for this hour
which makes us proud and happy.
According to your command, my Leader,
a youth stands here...
a youth that knows
neither class nor caste.
The young generation of our people
follows afteryou.
Just as you demonstrate the highest
self-sacrifice in this Nation...
so does this youth wish to be selfless.
Because you embody
the concept of fidelity for us...
therefore we wish to be faithful.
Adolf Hitler,
the Leader of German Youth, attention!
My German youth.
After one year
I can greet you again here.
You standing here today
represent something...
that is happening all over Germany.
And we want that you,
German boys and girls...
will absorb everything
that we wish for Germany.
We want to be one people...
and through you,
to become this people.
We want a society with
neither castes nor ranks.
And you must not allow
these ideas to grow within you.
We want to see one Reich.!
And you must educate yourselves
for this.
We want this people to be obedient...
and you must practice obedience
in yourselves.
We want this people
to be peace-loving...
but at the same time to be courageous.
And you must, for that reason,
be both peace-loving...
You must be both peace-loving
and strong.
We want this people
not to become soft...
but to become hard and, therefore...
you must steel yourselves for this
in youryouth.
You must learn sacrifice...
and also never to collapse.
Whatever we create today...
whatever we do...
will all pass away...
but in you Germany will live on.
And when we can no longer hold...
the flag that we tore from nothing...
you must hold it firmly in your fists!
And I know
that it cannot be any other way...
as we bind ourselves together.
Foryou are flesh ofourflesh
andbloodfrom ourblood.!
The same spirit that governs us...
burns in youryoung minds.
And when the great columns
of the movement...
sweep through Germany today...
then I know that you will close ranks...
and we know that Germany
lies in front ofus...
Germanymarches within us...
andGermany followsbehindus.!

''Sea ofFlags''...
and ''CathedralofLights''
on Zeppelin Field.
Ayear ago...
we met for the first time
on this field;
the first general review
of political leaders...
of the National Socialist Party.
They are not here
at the summons of their hearts alone...
but also at the summons
of their loyalty.
It was the great calamity of our people
that drove us to the struggle...
brought us together...
and left us greater.
Those who do not understand...
have not experienced
the same calamities among their people.
These things appear
enigmatic and mysterious...
that hundreds of thousands
would be led to assemble...
amidst calamity and passion.
Others cannot understand...
that this is not
an order of the State.!
Theyare deceiving themselves.!
The State doesnot orderus.!
We orderthe State.!
The State didnot create us.!
Rather we createdourown State.!
No, the movement lives...
and it is grounded hard and fast.
And as long as one of us
can draw a breath...
he will give his strengths
to the movement...
just as it was in yesteryear.
Then drum will join drum...
flag will join flag...
group will join group,
Gau to Gau...
and after that,
this earlier divided people...
will follow these sacred columns
of the Nation.
It would be an outrage
ifwe were to lose...
what we have fought for...
with so much labor,
so much worry...
so much sacrifice,
and so many privations.
One cannot live faithfully
and give up...
what has given meaning and purpose
to one's entire life.
That would not be so...
if it were not a cardinal command.
And no earthly power
gave us that command.
Forthe God, ourGod, who created
ourpeople, gave us that command.!
So it is our vow this evening...
that each hour, on everyday...
to think onlyofGermany
ofthe People andReich...
andofourGerman nation.!
To the Germanpeople.!
Hail Victory.!Hail Victory.!

My Führer :
Just as we have always done our duty
to you in the past...
so too in the future,
we await your orders alone.
And we, Comrades, know only to obey...
the orders of our Führer...
and to prove that we have remained
true to the Führer.
Our Führer, Adolf Hitler:
Hail Victory.!Hail Victory.!
SA and SS men:
A few months ago...
a dark shadow cast itself
across our Movement.
The SA and other institutions
of the Party...
had nothing whatsoever to do
with this shadow.
They who would believe that a rift has
opened in the unity of the Movement...
deceive themselves.
Itstands fastas thisblockhere...
and nothing in Germany
will break it.
And when anyone does harm
to the spirit of my SA...
then the SA will not be harmed...
but those who do this harm...
will injure only themselves!
And only a fool
or a known liar...
could think...
that I would ever
disband an organization...
that took us so manyyears to build.
My Comrades...
we stand fast together
for our Germany...
and we must stand fast together
for this Germany.
And I hand to each ofyou
the new insignia...
placing them with confidence...
in the hands that I see as the most
trustworthy there are in Germany.
For in the past you have proven
your loyalty to me a thousand times.
In the time to come, it cannot
and willnot be any different.
And so I greet you as myold,
faithfulSA andSSmen.!
Hail Victory.!Hail.!
Hail.!Hail.!

Deputy FührerRudolfHess
at the Podium
The Führer speaks:
The Sixth Party Day of the Movement
has come to and end.
What appeared
like a show of political strength...
for millions of Germans
outside of our ranks.
For hundreds of thousands
of fighters...
it was ultimately more.
The great personal
and spiritual meeting...
of the old fighters
and comrades in struggle.
And, perhaps, a cross section ofyou...
despite the forced civility
of this review of our Party...
will return with courageous hearts
to the days in which it was difficult
to be a National Socialist.
When our Party consisted
of only seven members...
it already had two principles.
First, it would be a Party
with a true ideology.
And second, it would be,
uncompromisingly...
the one andonlypowerin Germany.
We had to remain in the minority,
because we mobilized...
the most valuable elements of struggle
and sacrifice in the Nation...
which have always been not in the
majority, but rather in the minority.
And because these are the racially best
of the German nation...
they can in the proudest self-esteem...
claim the leadership
of the Reich and the people.
The German people...
and subordinated itself to
this leadership in ever-growing numbers!
The German people is happy...
in the knowledge
that a constantly changing vision...
has been replaced by a fixedpole.!
Whoever feels that he is the carrier
of the best blood...
and knowingly uses it
to attain the leadership...
will never relinquish it!
Ludwig Müller, Reichsbischof
There is always a part of the people who
stand out as really active fighters...
and more is expected from them
than from the millions of national
comrades in the general population.
For them it is not simply enough
to make the pledge: ''Ibelieve.!''
Rather, the affirmation: ''Ifight.!''
For all time to come the Party will be
the source of political leadership
for the German people.
It will in its teaching...
and was ultimately in its organization
hard as steel...
malleable in its tactics
and adaptable in its entirety;
yet it will be a training school
like a holyorder for political leaders.
It must be shown, however,
that all upstanding Germans
become NationalistSocialists.
Only the best NationalistSocialists,
however, are Party Comrades.!
Once, our enemies worried us and
persecuted us and, from time to time...
removed the lesser elements
from the Movement for us.
Today we must examine ourselves
and remove from our midst
the elements that have become bad.
Andtherefore, do notbelong with us.!
It is our wish and will...
that this State and this Reich
last for thousand years.
We can be happy to know
that this future belongs entirely to us.!
When the olderonesamong us falter...
theyouth willstiffen
andremain until theirbodies decay.
Only then, ifwe in the Party
with our most obedient dedication...
become the highest embodiment of
National Socialist thought and being...
then the Party will materialize...
into an eternalandindestructible
pillar of the German people and Reich.
Then our glorious
and laudable Army...
the old, proud,
standard bearers of our people...
who are equally tradition minded...
will champion the Political Leadership
and the Party.
And then these two institutions
will equally educate the German man...
and, therefore, strengthen
and carry on their shoulders...
the German State, the German Reich.!
At this hour, tens of thousands
of our Party Comrades
are already leaving the City.
While many of them relive
the meeting in their memories...
still others are already planning
the next review.
And again the people come and go and
they will be engrossed anew and happy...
and inspired, for the idea and
the Movement live on in our people...
and with the Movement
are symbol of eternity!
Longlive
the NationalSocialist Movement.!
Longlive Germany.!
Deputy FührerRudolfHess
