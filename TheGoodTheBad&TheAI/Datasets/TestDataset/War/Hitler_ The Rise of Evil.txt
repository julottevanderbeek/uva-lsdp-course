Parsifal is the German ideal.
A combination of stength,
determination and purity.
Hello, gentlemen!
My son, Adolf.
That used to be my desk
before I retired,
which is why you need to apply
yourself at school.
Stupid old fool.
He's perfectly normal for a boy his age.
He's God's curse on me
for marrying my niece.
Uncle, don't be absurd.
You'll get what you want in the end.
You'll be a painter, an artist...
anything you want.
Oh, my little genius.
You little bastard.
You burned my beehives again!
Uncle. Do you know what I think?
I think, we should
take him out of school.
He's so talented an artist
and what does he need
with science and mathematics?
Uncle?
Uncle. What is it?
Oh. My God!
Adi. Adi, quickly.
Come help me with your father. Uncle?
- I' m going to Vienna, Mother.
- What?
I want to see opera. Great opera.
I want to study at the Fine Arts Academy.
It's too far. You'll get lost.
I' ve heard too many stories
of Jews and gypsies taking advantage.
I am not a boy, Mother!
She's very sick.
She won't live until Christmas.
She has cancer of the breast.
It's a lie.
I know it's hard.
She'll do anything to ruin my career.
You may begin.
At the end of 30 minutes, I will collect
the sketches. And this time tomorrow,
the names of those who have passed this part
of the exmination will be posted on the door.
Did you do well
in your drawing exam?
Were you accepted?
Someday I shall be a great artist, Mother.
I know you will.
Angela...
... I know he's only your half-brother...
... but I want you to take care of him
as if he were your own.
He's so sensitive.
I don't know how he'll survive
without me.
Yes.
Amen.
Adi, I know it's hard,
but you have to be brave.
Don't tell me how to feel.
You didn't love her.
She was only your stepmother.
You wouldn't know how to love anyone.
You're just a lump, a peasant.
God for nothing
but breeding more bitches like you.
I'm sorry, Herr Hitler.
You don't have a style.
Your people are like buildings.
There's no life to them.
Perhaps if you tried architecture
or theatrical design. I'm truly sorry.
I have a class to teach.
Best of luck...
I'm all right. I'm just waiting
for my inheritance, that's all.
It's the Jews' fault, you know.
They swarm into our country,
steal the bread from our tables.
Just ask our mayor.
Well said, Herr Doctor!
- They are wolves.
- Hear, hear!
Beasts of prey in human form!
Soup! Soup!
It's all their fault, you know.
They swarm into our country,
take the food from our mouths.
And here we are, German and hungry.
- It's not funny.
- I'm sorry, I thought...
I thought you were a Jew.
You look like one.
Come on. Wake up!
Out of your bed. Come on.
You've got ten minutes to get out of here!
"My dearest sister...
My studies are going very well here.
My art is getting a lot of attention.
I'll be famous before you know it.
I look forward to my upcoming birthday
when my inheritance is due.
I wonder could you bring it in person?
I'll wait for you in the railway station.
Under the big clock."
Adi? It's you.
Angela.
Godness, what happened?
I thought you said you were doing fine.
A bit of bad luck...
Do you have it?
I wish you would have said something.
You could have come home.
Say hello to your Uncle Dolf, Geli.
She's a shy girl,
but very affectionate.
Well, it's the Jews. It's the Jews. They run
the galleries and won't buy my paintings.
The Poles... they work... or next to nothing,
so I can't get a job.
That's terrible. You know,
there's plenty of work in Linz.
- Oh, you must be joking.
- No, I'm serious.
Here. Happy birthday.
Our father worked hard for this.
Linz - it's the last place I would go.
You can't stay here.
Of course not. The sooner I leave
this Babylon of races the better.
I'm off where the real Germans are.
War! War! Austrian Archduke's
assassination leads to war!
Come closer.
Let me speak!
England, France and Russia
are joining forces against our ally Austria.
We must stand with her,
united, ready to sacrifice.
Our lives are nothing.
Our country is everything.
We are now only Germans!
War! War! War! War!
I need one of you men
to deliver a message.
- Here, sergeant!
- Stay down. Stay down.
Take this to Lieutenant Guttman
at the command post. Wait for a reply.
Sit. Foxl, sit.
Sit!
Looks like your fiancee's got
a mind of her own, Adi.
Foxl, sit! Sit!
You make a fool out of me.
You try to humiliate me.
You must learn... to... sit... down!
That's enough.
Everyone was killed.
The entire coompany wiped out.
The entire company - except me, of course.
Even my dog, my little Foxl.
Just seconds before the bomb landed,
she led me outside as if she knew.
She's so loving, so affectionate...
and then in one brief moment... she's gone.
No, she's not.
I think... she's in the stew.
Pacifists. Marxists.
Socialists.
Jews.
They call themselves Communist now
and they're everywhere -
exept here at the front.
Who pissed in your brain?
Please.
Do you know any Jew soldiers? Hm?
Look around you. Do you see any?
I'm a Jew, Adi...
so shut up and eat.
This has to get through as soon as possible.
We don't have much time left. It's dangerous.
If either of you makes it,
you'll deserve an Iron Cross.
- Yes, sir.
- Go with God.
- Yes, Corporal?
- Nothing, sir.
I followed your orders, sir.
I deserve this medal.
I risked my life.
We all risk our lives - every day.
- You gave me your word, Lieutenant.
- Believe me, if it was up to me...
I did believe you.
Anyone else would have laughed.
- What do you mean by that?
- I've always stood up for your people.
When anyone said,
"Oh, you can't trust them"...
... I pointed to you, sir.
Take a deep breath, gents.
You can almost smell the French perfume.
- Wait till We get to Paris.
- Attention! Sir!
Good evening, gentlemen. I'm here to tell you
you'll all be packing out in the morning.
- We're being deployed to the eastern front.
- But, sir, we're only 50km from Paris.
They'll think..we're on the retreat.
Those are General Hindenburg's orders,
Corporal.
There's your prize.
Now go tell the men on the front lines.
Sir!
This is no way to win a war.
Mustard gas!
Masks on!
Mustard gas!
Masks on!
Mustard gas!
You're not blind, Corporal.
Gas wouldn't do that.
It irritates the eyes, swells the lids.
Once we have these bandages off,
you will see as well as ever.
I have to get back!
I have to get back... to the front.
- A message, Herr Doctor.
- To push!
Gentlemen...
may I have your attention?
Earlier today, the army high command
agreed to negotiate the terms of surrender.
The war is over.
No!
We must place ourselves now
at the mercy of the victors...
Shut up! Shut up!
... and pray they will be generous.
Shut up!
It isn't the end.
It's the beginning.
Down with the Kaiser!
Death to the Kaiser!
We're all together, comrades!
Death to the Kaiser!
The Free Corps Militia led by Captain
Ernst Röhm and others, took back the city today
after a tense two weeks of Communist rule.
What happens now that Germany's
best-kept secret is out -
that the demobilised soldiers of the war
are still active and armed in our countrysides?
- Herr Gerlich, you'll be late.
- Don't worry, Frau Schmidt.
These things never start on time.
With the collapse of the monarchy
and now the Communist regime,
what new form of government awaits us?
Deep feelings of nationalistic pride
are springing up against...
No, no... in defiance of the Communists,
the allies of anyone
who thinks Germany is finished.
All right, everybody. Come on now.
Let's get started. Let's get started.
What are you doing here?
Sorry. Sorry.
- Judge.
- Ah, Herr Gerlich.
Good day for the news, bad for a wedding.
Thank you for waiting.
I couldn't very well start without you.
Officially the Reds are gone but
the army needs to make sure they stay gone.
It's my job as head of Army lnformation
to prevent the sort of civil unrest
that happened last spring
from happening again.
I gather you're very outspoken
in your nationalist leanings.
- I believe in Germany, sir.
- Good.
There are nearly 50 political factions
in this  city at the moment
and I use informants to identify the more
aggressive ones. Does this interest you?
- Informing, sir?
One of these groups is the German Workers'
Party led by a man called Anton Drexler.
They gather in the
back room of a beer hall.
Just an excuse to have a drink I expect but...
pay them a visit and tell me what they're planning.
- I don't drink, sir.
- Just listen then.
But interest equals slavery.
The Berlin-centred economy,
which is currently collapsing...
... leaves us no other choice than to declare
Bavarian independence.
- Waiter, two more beers.
The state of Bavaria must separate from the rest
of Germany and form its own nation.
Insane.
Of course, we are a different society.
We are predominantly Catholic.
They are not.
We're all German.
Culturally, perhaps, there are similarities,
but even there...
What about Parsifal? Lohengrin?
Young man, I'm talking about
reality not fairy tales.
You're talking about the purity
of the German people... which is no fairy tale.
- As I was saying. Interest equals...
- Find out who he is.
- What's this?
- It's my report on the German Workers' Party, sir.
I only asked for a few words.
They've asked me if I'd like to join.
I haven't... accepted yet.
Should we be concerned about them?
That's all I need to know.
It's club life of the lowest form, sir.
But I like the underlying politics.
"The Nationalist agenda
must include elimination of the Jews."
What's this have to do with your report?
Just some thoughts of my own I added.
You disagree?
- It's just not feasible.
- Oh, it's very feasible, sir.
Just drive them out.
Deport them if necessary.
Can you imagine a world without them?
How pure.
How holy.
Do you think...
there are any Jews in Valhalla?
Do you have my papers, Mayr?
Yes, Captain Röhm.
I should like to introduce you
to Corporal Hitler, sir.
He's one of our informants.
If you'll excuse us, Corporal.
He's an odd one, isn't he?
It is my pleasure to introduce to you
our guest speaker for this evening.
Many of you may remember him
by his comments at our last meeting.
So please welcome Herr Adolf...
... Adolf Hitler.
When I was a boy, I heard the story...
Louder.
... I heard the story of the Holy Grail...
.. and how it could only be found
by one who was pure of heart.
Indeed, we have a history of purity
in this country.
But we have fallen on hard times.
Our military is in tatters.
Our economy collapsing.
But it's not poverty or weakness
that's our problem...
- Speak up.
-... it's indifference.
Is anyone listening?
That's the problem nowadays, isn't it?
No-one cares.
No wonder we face extinction.
Pride...
pride is a weapon.
A sword to be used against our enemies.
But don't be deceived. They are strong.
Stronger than we are.
And it's not the French or the English
I'm talking about.
Our enemies...
live among us.
Socialists.
Communists.
The foreign invaders who come to our country
to destroy us and take over our lives!
In the six months since the fall
of the Communist government.
the new German democracy has given birth
to dozens of political factions.
But none is growing more rapidly
than the German Workers' Party.
newly dubbed
the Party of the National Socialists,
whose fiery speaker...
... Adolf Hitler...
... preaches against the influence
of foreign invaders.
Who alone are responsible for the moral
decadence that now riddles our society?
- The Jews!
- The Jews! Yes!
Who call themselves German,
and who are now, and who have always been
unwelcome, unwanted,
and they are everywhere.
Invading our government, stripping us of our
savings, raping our families and our heritage.
I tell you friends, this is war -
a war that is soon to turn.
For the invaders will become the victims!
Hello?
Frieda.
Herr Hanfstaengl.
Oh, it's good to see you.
Look... at you.
- Who's this? Is this little Egon?
- Mm-hm.
He looks just like you did
when you were his age.
Frieda, this is my wife Helene.
She was raised in America, but don't worry,
she's bred from good German stock...
- Her family's from Bremen.
- Oh, how do you do, Frau Hanfstaengl.
I apologise for the mess.
I'll have it clean by morning.
Frieda, don't worry yourself. It's lovely.
- lt'll be just fine.
- Would you like to hold him?
Yes, I'd love it.
Ssh.
- He's so gorgeous.
- Come.
Do you like it?
It's extraordinary.
- It's everything that you promised.
- And this isn't the half of it.
There are such opportunities
here for us now.
Germany is starting to rebuild itself
and we... are going to make pots of money.
Darling, it's impolite to talk about money.
It'll be good for the country, too.
Wait till you hear my plans.
Don't bother me with your plans.
You just let me handle the dinner parties.
Hitler! Hitler! Hitler! Hitler!
Sit down.
Where have you been?
It's almost time to start.
Oh, and come in the front next time,
where people can see you.
My supporters would slow me down.
- It seems a little empty tonight.
- Nonsense.
The crowd is bigger than last time.
Unfortunately, there are
some Communists out there.
So, go easy on the rhetoric.
A riot would only get us in the papers.
Isn't that what we want?
Universal military service
shall be abolished in Germany.
Germany will pay war reparations for all damage
done to Allied civilians and their property.
Responsibility for the outbreak of the war...
... rests solely on German shoulders.
But a few of the demands
of the Treaty of Versailles.
Impossible, you say.
It will break us.
But don't you see, that's the point?
They want to break... us.
And who do I mean by "them"?
I mean the Reds.
These fools who spread a disease called
Communism to empty-headed dreamers.
- Look who's talking.
- Right! Rubbish!
The most effective medicine is a bullet.
That's the best way
to cure us of these idiots.
- ldiots are men like you with nothing to say!
- Shut up!
Marx was a Jew.
The Communist Party is run by Jews.
It's all a plot to destroy Germany.
To bastardise our blood.
Infiltrate our lives.
They want to wipe the Aryan race
from the face of the earth!
Fritz, you're writing.
No, I'm just thinking, that's all.
About?
About what's happening.
Munich. Bavaria. Germany.
- My three rivals.
- It's so exciting.
Sophie, Germany is at the
crossroads of history.
We grew up with the Kaiser telling us what to do
and we're finally thinking on our own.
We have the Communists on the left,
Social Democrats on the middle,
the Free Corps joining forces with the right.
It's one big political brawl.
- That doesn't worry you?
- Why should it?
Nothing good ever comes from brawls.
- When are you men going to learn that?
- When are you women going to learn
that extraordinary times
demand extraordinary measures?
Yes - war, assassination...
All right, all right.
I won't argue with you on that.
But I promise you that whatever comes
of this brawl will be extraordinary.
- Here. Go.
- We need more men like you in the party.
Oh, we hate the Communists -
wherever they go we'll go.
Whether or not we'll do anything
for the party is entirely up to you.
Here. Go!
You know, I've always been a great admirer
of yours - your reputation, your war medals.
Oh, my war medal is here.
I'm prouder of this
than of any Iron Cross.
Speak of me, Herr Hitler,
you speak of all my men.
We're all soldiers here.
These men, together with thousands and
thousands of others, served our country well.
Even after they were abandoned
by the army they continued to fight
- to put down a Communist revolution.
- Yes.
Now, all of a sudden, the rich that
backed us up are charming away
Why?
I don't understand.
But if my men can crush a revolution,
they can also create one.
Because they love this country
as much as you or I do.
Yes.
The only little problem is...
they're unemployed.
Yes.
Not so long ago,
we Germans thirsted after blood
We had half the world in trenches,
crawling through the mud
We were close to victory,
how come we lost the war?
Where were all those leaders
that we counted on before?
Oh, my God. Ernst, is that you?
Friedrich. Friedrich Hollander, my God.
What are you doing here?
I run this place. I direct this show,
I write these songs - I am this place.
Freddie and I went to school together.
We were... sparring partners.
- In the fencing club.
- That too.
- And this beautiful lady is?
- His current sparring partner.
Helene Hanfstaengl.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Friedrich Hollander.
That's my wife.
... poison gas
And now that we have seen
the face of war
We're not the same men
that we were before...
Everyone's depressed -
bad for the economy but excellent for cabaret.
German people don't need democracy,
for God's sake,
they need music, laughter,
someone to tell them what to do
- so they can get in line and follow.
- Don't tell me you've become a nationalist?
I'm a satirist, Ernst, the most
dangerous politician of the mob.
Who just fell and scraped your knee?
It's time for fun and games
again in Germany...
Speaking of humour, I'm going to hear Hitler
tomorrow - would you like to come?
Hitler? The anti-Semite?
The National Socialist anti-Semite.
Call them Nazis just to piss them off.
- I hear he's fascinating.
- Well, that's very open-minded of you.
- You mean for a jew?
- Yes.
I'm not supporting him, for God's sake.
I need new material.
... the face of war
We're not the same men
that we were before
And we can say without hypocrisy
Oh, the next one that we fight
will end in victory!
We will survive.
That's what they tell us.
What they mean is - they will survive.
We surrendered in November at a time
when we were perched on the edge of victory.
betrayed by the cowards
and the traitors within our ranks.
Communist pigs!
How do we fight them?
We unite. We must join
together for a greater Germany.
Clean him up a bit,
he might be worth something.
He's a cartoon.
We will sacrifice, we will struggle, yes,
but only then will we triumph.
And we will triumph!
With the hero Lohengrin
as our model
and the music of Wagner
as our inspiration,
we will hang the profiteers,
crush the Communists.
We will disinfect our country
of the Jewish vermin.
Funny... after 500 years
you'd think I'd be used to it.
Ernst.
Ernst?
We will triumph!
We will triumph!
We will triumph!
We will triumph!
We will triumph!
We will triumph!
Excuse me, Herr Hitler.
I heard you speak... last night.
You mentioned Wagner.
Ssh.
I was told I could find you here,
that you never leave.
Herr Hitler, I was wondering...
Ssh, just... just play.
I know some people
who would love to hear you speak...,
who are not likely to go to a beer hall.
The wealthy. I've met a few.
Armchair politicians who care more about
their money than they do their own country.
But as your party's propaganda leader
you must know that to defend their money,
they'll spend a good deal of it.
That is, if someone they trust
tells them it's a safe bet. That's where I come in.
Herr Hitler... I can make you very popular.
Far more popular than him.
But you have to admit
the colour catches the eye.
Why don't you have a poster?
And a flag?
Your picture should be everywhere.
With your name in large letters.
You might consider a more distinctive look..
For exmple. When you think of Lenin.
You think of bearded and bald.
Not that that's attractive but...
but it does stick with you.
Herr Hitler.
I'm Helene, Ernst's wife.
He's told me so much about you. Come.
With respect, the Kaiser's a coward.
Better off without him really.
No, we need someone with courage,
courage to drive out these foreign agitators.
A man who would smile in the face of
the machine gun and scare the rabble shitless.
Would that be you, sir?
No, Captain Göring, not me, sir.
I'm just a voice crying in the wilderness.
Above all, we must remove the Jews.
They run our banks, they lost us the war. They're
responsible for the economic disaster we're in.
Sir, my father was a Jew and a stronger patriot
could not be found at this table.
I am the man I am
today because of him.
Baron...
surely he wasn't talking
about your father.
He meant the Communist Jews,
didn't you, Herr Hitler.
You will excuse us,
Frau Hanfstaengl.
Darling.
Herr Hitler.
Please.
Please accept my apologies.
I'm sure he meant no disrespect.
My husband and I have several
Jewish friends in America.
What this man is doing, Madame, is heating up
the hatred in this country to boiling point.
And all for his own purposes,
I might add.
May God forgive you and
your husband for supporting him.
... I to know what it's like
to be mistaken in a friend.
If he has deceived you as to his heritage,
who knows what else is he capable of?
You 're a very gifted speaker, Herr Hitler.
I think... it is an honour
to be at this table with you.
I began life as a quite
gifted artist, Captain Göring.
And I brought something
I want you all to see.
Simple.
Aryan.
What does it mean?
It means the unconquerable.
Do you like it, Frau Hanfstaengl?
It's very... hypnotic.
Tell us, Herr Hitler,
have you considered publishing?
Well done.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The turning point in my life was when
the blindfold was ripped from my eyes!
And only then will we triumph.
And we will triumph!
The Jew in all his terrible shame!
We will hang the profiteers!
We recognise him.
We recognise him.
We will make them pay!
We will triumph!
We will triumph! We will triumph!
We will triumph!
What's going on?
Herr Hitler... we er...
Who is this?
My new friends.
What are you arguing about?
We have been approached
by the German Socialist Party to join forces.
Our principles are similar, we can negotiate
a new platform to eliminate our differences,
and together both parties will be even stronger.
Er... some of the others here disagree.
I see.
- Would you like to know what I think?.
- Yes, of course.
- I think you're a traitor.
- But Herr Hitler...
Compromise is not possible!
If their members wish to quit their party
and join ours that's another thing,
but our principles are our principles
and cannot be changed!
Once again, Drexler, you prove my point.
This is a tedious,
amateur organisation
and you are a jealous fool.
Which brings me to this.
Who wrote this?
Don't pretend you don't know what it is.
One of our own members
calls me a dangerous demagogue.
Are you out to destroy me?
I tell you, sir,
I don't need you or your Party.
I will form my own Party.
Herr Hitler, Herr Hitler!
Herr Hitler, please.
You're right, of course.
May I have your attention?
The leadership committee
has just made an important decision.
I no longer feel qualified
to lead our struggle
so it is my privilege to present you
with our new leader.
Our new Führer...
... Adolf Hitler.
Oh, my God.
No, no, a little higher.
That's good. That's very good.
Beautiful, marvellous.
No. No.
Yes.
Wonderful choice, my Führer,
but don't you think... this look is better?
Excuse me, Herr Hitler, a message
from Bavarian Prime Minister Von Kahr.
It seems I'm being asked
to cancel my speeches.
Not asked, ordered.
The Chancellor wants to pay war reparations
and honour the Treaty of Versailles.
As a consequence,
the people are ready to riot.
Kahr's ordered a state of emergency.
placed himself in charge.
He adds...
"If Hitler speaks, it may only stir things up."
Stir things up.
Stir things up?
Have you been to the marketplace?
Do you know how much it costs
for a loaf of bread these days?
The wheelbarrows aren't big enough
to carry the money in!
And he's afraid I'll stir things up?
You tell Commissar Kahr
this is not a time for silence,
this is a time for revolution.
Right, well, I suppose that leaves me.
I know you're upset.
Of course you are.
Commissar Von Kahr is acting rashly.
Herr Hitler, you mustn't take it personally.
We both want the same thing.
Right now Von Kahr
thinks that he doesn't need you.
You must be clever
and show him that he does.
That you have the support of the people.
Hm?
I want to show you something.
This is an article by an editor named Fritz
Gerlich that is, on the whole, complimentary.
Everyone who's anyone reads him and...
he also happens to Write
Commissar Von Kahr's speeches.
I think you shoould pay him a visit.
I baked these this morning.
I hope you like them.
You must have been very brave,
Herr Hitler.
The lron Cross is no small feat.
Thank you, dear.
I've heard you speak...,
Herr Hitler.
You're very persuasive.
You know, we share some beliefs - the need
for a political leader, strong voice to guide.
Yes, well, we need someone to take charge...
... throw out this Treaty of Versailles,
refuse to pay the war reparations.
War reparations. I agree with that.
What's that?.
- It helps me to keep notes during an interview.
- What?
- That way when I get back...
- This isn't an interview.
What made you think that?
Kahr's a fool.
I know he's your friend,
but he has to realise I am not the enemy.
If he wants to make a stand against Berlin.
Fine. I won't stop him.
In fact...
... I should be his partner.
But you have fundamental areas
of disagreement. You both wish to lead.
Lead?
I have no ambition to lead.
So long as Kahr keeps us a place
in his government, that's all we want.
A little... little piece of the cake, as it were.
You know...
you know we could use a man like you.
You could perhaps...
write... for us.
On behalf of the Nationalist Socialist Party.
Yes.
But I don't write propaganda.
Who said anything about propaganda?
I'm talking about the truth.
Look around you.
Immigrants, Jews.
Stealing everything we work for.
The German Jews? Any party that comes
to power will surely guarantee that...
We're talking about Jews here!
They're not citizens.
They have no rights.
You are supposed to be a Nationalist.
You should know better.
I will never compromise on the Jews.
Never.
He's insane.
A complete psychotic.
He may be a compelling
speaker on stage but...
... in person I could see into his eyes
and what I saw was...
... terrifying.
And I intend to shut him down.
With all due respect, Commissar Von Kahr...
you need to handle him with care.
Don't worry, I will.
I know how to deal with Adolf Hitler.
There were over 40 political
murders last weekend.
Reds killing SA. SA killing Reds.
General Von Lossow and Colonel Seisser here
are very concerned, as am l.
Well, if my party had a voice
in your government,
perhaps we might find less violent ways
of expressing ourselves.
Which is exactly what I'm
prepared to offer you.
In... a few weeks' time, General Von Lossow
and Colones Seisser intend to march on Berlin.
A putsch to bring the national
government under our control.
Would you like to be
part of that putsch?
Yes, of course.
Then you must be very quiet.
You can speak...
give the impression of business as usual.
But you must also promise me...
... if you wish to play any part in our government,
there will be no more violence.
Berlin mustn't believe we have
designs against them.
You have my full support.
Just keep your men quiet.
I can't do that.
Of course you can.
You're the leader, they listen to you.
I pay them to listen to you.
It's not a question about money,
it's the principle.
If there's a Red anywhere near,
there's going to be a fight.
Look... I don't care how you do this...
... just keep them quiet.
He won't listen. We have to find some other way,
some kind of figurehead.
Make it tighter.
So, how is your father, Hess?
Very well, General Ludendorff,
he sends his best.
Who is this?
May I present Herr Hitler,
to you, sir?
I believe you've met before
at one of Captain Göring's soirees.
Oh, yes. Er, what can I do for you?
No, no, that's too tight. Let it out.
Your Excellency is the...
our... heroic leader of the Nationalist Right,
while I'm but its spokesman.
No, more, more, I can't breathe.
I was wondering if I could perhaps
discuss a little plan I have,
we're confident of gaining
Your Excellency's support.
Support? For what?
We're planning a transference of power.
Bavarian Commissar Von Kahr
has seen the wisdom
of joining the National Socialists
for a march on Berlin.
Well... good for you.
Those idiots at the Reichstag
haven't learned their lesson, so... kick them out.
We need true Germans running this
country again, like we had with Bismarck...
I knew him, you know. Hm.
My God, what a man.
So... what's your plan?
And can you carry this off?
I won't be made a fool of, you know.
Your Excellency,
we are confident of our success.
By the way, I'm speaking
next week... at the Circus Krone.
I would be honoured
if you would be my guest.
For many years, my friends,
I was like a prisoner -
blindfolded, fending off
flaws from every directions.
What had I done
to deserve this treatment?
I did not even know
who my enemy was.
An innocent victim of greed
and of hatred and of cunning!
In recent years
we have all suffered like this.
Germany more than any of us.
Yet there is no need
to live in darkness.
The turning point in my life was when
the blindfold was ripped from my eyes.
And I could see my enemy.
Our enemy - the Jew!
We recognise him.
We recognise him.
Nobody leaves. No-one.
We see how his filth and his greed have
staggered the heart of this great country.
We must crush this vermin!
We must wipe this plague
from our nation!
What we say tonight
will soon be forgotten.
What we do will live on
for a thousand, thousand years!
What's the matter?
Lossow has said we have to wait
two more weeks before they take action.
Seisser was in Berlin.
Some important meeting.
Kahr wouldn't see me.
But in two days he intends to address
all the right-wing political factions
at one of their beer halls.
All of them, that is, except you.
He's outfoxed you, lad.
He clearly intends to form a coalition
with all of your competitors
and create a new government
without you.
He brought you into this
simply to keep you quiet.
We'll move without them, then.
We'll seize Munich.
We'll march on Berlin.
The people are with us.
Listen to them.
Gentlemen, our time has come.
I'll confront Kahr here.
Röhm and his men wait here.
We surround the barracks...
then attack...
Once the situation is secure,
I'll telepohone Röhm here at the beer hall.
Half of my men will cut the lines
at the telephone exchange.
The rest of us will secure
the military barracks.
No information in or out of Munich
unless I say so.
Gentlemen...
... I know this is often said and deeply felt...
... but none more deeply than tonight -
may God and the people
of Germany be with us.
We're brothers, you and l.
Together we will make history.
Your papers, please.
I couldn't sleep last night worrying
about this speech. His popularity's rising.
- If people don't hear the truth...
- Don't worry. They will.
Tonight we unify the other parties
and put an end to Adolf Hitler.
The circus rules
And I'm the lion tamer
An all-or-nothing savage autocrat
I crack my whip
The king of all the jungle
Just starts to purr
Like he's my pussycat
But smell the stench
You can't escape the jungle
And though at peace
The animals still roar
Those darling beasts
They long to slay each other
Only my whip
Keeps them froom going to war
They throw an attack...
Gentlemen, history has brought us
to the edge of chaos...
.. and now we have a choice.
Men act like beasts
Beasts act like men
They both need training now and then
Or we can, with courage
and faith, leap...
What's that drumming?
What's coming?
The national revolution has begun.
The building is surrounded.
No-one may leave.
Any trouble, you will be shot.
Inside.
Inside!
Stay calm.
Remain in your places.
We have the building surrounded.
Get me Ludendorff.
Sorry to surprise you like this,
but then you're no stranger
to intrigue, are you?
I am forming a provisional
Reich government.
I will be in charge of the police,
General Ludendorff will be in charge
of the army,
and I will have a post for each of you.
I need your support.
You seem to have planned this well.
And where is General Ludendorff?
If he supports you
as you say he does...
why is he not here?
Oh, so the little man
pulled it off, did he?
Give me a moment.
Keep your heads!
Stay calm!
- He's a little late.
- Gentlemen. please!
What's going on?
- You sure he's coming at all?.
- Shut up!
Stay calm!
Shut up!
- Take your seats. Remain calm!
- Ludendorff's here.
He's here.
Your leaders are with us.
Will you join them?
Will you stand behind us?
The German revolution begins tonight!
Yes?
Good.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Stop.
There's an armed group
heading towards the barracks.
Fall back!
Get out of my way!
What doo yoou mean they fell back?
I can't believe this is happening.
Nobody does anything right.
- Where's your conscience?
- Conscience.
A Jewish invention, sir.
Conscience.
Do you mind if we visit our wives, General?
They'll be worried.
Of course, of course,
mustn't worry, poor women.
Mobilise the army. Now.
What the hell's happening?
There are too many of them.
Somebody must have betrayed us.
What are you doing here?
Where's Kahr and the others?
Oh, I let them go. Their wives
were a concern. That's all right.
They gave me their word
they wouldn't notify the authorities.
Good God!
- Follow me.
- Let's go.
We'll take to the streets.
We'll take to the streets.
We'll go to the War Ministry. There were 8000
people at the Circus Krone the other night.
As soon as they know what's happened,
they will support us.
Fire!
Hurry up. Retreat!
Get him out of here!
Fall back... fall back!
Children!
Papa! Mama!
Go. Drive.
Hello.
Darling, it's me.
I've got to get out. It's all gone sour.
Don't let anyone in.
I want you to take the children
and go to your mother's.
Ernst, what happened?
I'll call you there.
Frieda!
Frieda!
I know a safe place.
Turn right up ahead.
- You're frightening the children.
- Go get the door.
Go, Frieda, now.
Frieda! Frieda, stop it!
Shut up! Shut up!
Now take the children outside.
Go on. Now.
Mummy!
Frau Hanfstaengl. Open the door!
We know he's in there!
Frau Hanfstaengl!
Open the door!
Up you come. C ome on.
Herr Hitler.
Of course, that's what...
that's exactly what they want...
He's on a hunger strike.
If he doesn't testify or worse, if he dies,
they'll come after everyone including us.
- You're out of your mind.
- Helene, someone has to answer for the putsch.
For God's sake, it was treason.
He won't listen to his men, but he likes you.
All you have to do is shore up his confidence.
- No.
- Helene!
Our lives, our future, depend on this.
I baked these myself.
You mustn't lose hope.
So many people believe in you.
Do you?
The first time I saw you...
... I knew that you were a great... man.
There he is.
Let us proceed.
General Ludendorff...
you have been accused of high treason.
How do you plead?
Not guilty.
Adolf Hitler...
... you have been accused of high treason.
How do you plead?
Guilty.
Herr Hitler, are you a German citizen?
Are you talking about a piece of paper
or the blood that runs through my veins?
Answer the question.
No.
In November of last year
you led a putsch against the Bavarian
state and German Reich.
You coerced and threatened Commissar Kahr,
General Lossow and Colonel Seisser.
You have been accused of high treason
and called an enemy of the state.
If a thief takes your money and you take it back...
does that make you also a thief?
In 1918 we were betrayed
by the November Criminals,
the ones who claimed
to be our leaders.
They ended the war,
signed the Treaty of Versailles.
And that... was high treason.
This is supposed to be an interrogation,
not a speech.
I was simply taking back...
that which was stolen from us five years before.
Namely the right...
the right to defend ourselves
against the wishes of an incapable parliament.
I used no force. I used no force.
I was supported by Commissar Kahr.
Why isn't he on trial?
If I'm guilty of anything...
then I am guilty of fighting to defend
the rights of the German people.
Fascinating, isn't he?
Fritz, please!
What is it?
- Please just...
- Sit down.
... open the door.
What's wrong?
Today I was absolutely convinced
that it would be over.
That he would be exposed
as cold-blooded and psychotic.
But they cheered him, Sophie.
Hitler stood up in a court of law
and claimed that all he wants
is to give the nation back to its people
and the people believed him.
Even the judge was impressed.
He's figured us out.
- Figured who out?
- People.
You've met him.
He's not human.
He's studied people
in order to appear human,
but all he's discovered
is our fear and our hatred.
And now we're all running toward
a monster we should be running from.
Extraordinary times
demand extraordinary measures.
You said that once, remember?
When all those drunks in the beer halls
were throwing mugs at each other?
I told you nothing good
would come of it.
That was then.
Coome inside now.
I'll fix you something to eat.
Fritz?
Thank you.
For what?
- Stop the presses!
- Stop the presses!
Stop the presses.
We've got a new front page.
Listen... everybody.
We have a new front page.
On the night of the putsch,
Commissar Von Kahr
was promising an initiative that would have
turned this country around had he been heard.
I know because I wrote it.
Tonight, we are the voice of sanity.
Listen.
"History has brought us to the edge of chaos
and we now have a choice.
Either we can jump into the abyss or,
with courage and faith, leap to the other side."
I demand freedom!
"The abyss is Hitler's party
of National Socialism -
a party of intolerance and hatred.
false imagery and false hope.
A pit of nonsense and outright lies."
They are the ones who deserve to be hung!
"He's an agitator who believes our fears
will drown out our reason.
And the worst we can do - the absolute worst
- is to do nothing."
All right. Let's get to work...
Traitor!
General Ludendorff...
the court finds you not guilty
and releases you from custody.
Herr Hitler...
... the court finds you guilty of treason.
Yes!
You are hereby sentenced
to a fine of 200 gold marks...
.. and five years in Landsberg prison.
You will...
you will be eligible for parole...
in nine months.
