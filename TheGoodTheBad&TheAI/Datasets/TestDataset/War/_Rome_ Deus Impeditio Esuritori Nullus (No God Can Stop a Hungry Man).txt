WAKE UP.
WAKE UP,
SLEEPY HEAD.
BE QUIET, WOMAN.
POSCA.
LUCIUS VORENUS.
YOUR MONTHLY raskalašenost
IS FINISHED ALREADY?
I SEE YOURS ISN'T.
THIS?
THIS IS NOTHING.
THIS IS FOR MY NERVES.
WHERE IS HE?
OH, WHERE IS HE?
OH, A DEEP QUESTION.
HIS MORTAL FLESH
IS IN THE THRONE ROOM
MEETING THE DELEGATION
FROM THE SENATE.
- THEY'RE HERE ALREADY?
- YES.
SENATOR BIBULUS AND SEVERAL
OTHER DISTINGUISHED MEN
WHOSE NAMES I FORGET
ARRIVED THIS MORNING.
AND WHY ARE YOU
NOT IN THERE?
I VALUE MY LIFE,
SUCH AS IT IS.
WHEN THE QUEEN
GROWLS AT ME,
HMM.
IT'S NOT COWARDICE.
WHO WOULD LOOK
AFTER MY WIFE?
Antony:
YOU SEE?
DEPENDING ON HOW FAST
HE'S GOING.
NOW HERE'S THE MOMENT
THE ANIMAL THINKS
ONLY OF HIS THIRST.
BUT HE CANNOT
RESIST THE WATER.
EASY, YOU SEE.
MY TURN.
ANTONY, IF WE MIGHT
DISCUSS THE MATTER AT HAND?
- SHH!
- SHH!
YOU'LL SCARE
OFF THE DEER.
- OH.
- HE MOVED.
- THE BEAST MOVED!
- AGAIN.
REGARDING
THE GRAIN SUPPLY...
IF YOU CAN GUARANTEE
DELIVERY BEFORE THE END
OF THE MONTH.
DOUBLE YOU SAY?
THAT'S NOT BAD.
- OH!
-
- TRIPLE.
- AGREED.
WE WILL PAY TRIPLE
THE CORRECT PRICE.
- AND CARTHAGE.
-
CARTHAGE WILL BE ANNEXED
TO ANTONY'S CONTROL.
THAT MAY BE POSSIBLE.
POOR OCTAVIAN, EH?
HE MUST BE
REALLY DESPERATE.
PEOPLE ARE STARVING,
DYING.
OCTAVIAN WILL DO
WHAT HE MUST TO PREVENT
FURTHER SUFFERING.
BECAUSE HE LOVES
THE PEOPLE SO.
- HE DOES.
- HE LOVES NOBODY
AND NOBODY LOVES HIM.
HE COULD FEED
THE PEOPLE LARKS
AND THEY WOULD STILL
LOVE ME MORE.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
VORENUS?
YES, SIR.
THERE WE ARE.
THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE.
THEY LOVE ME.
I HAVE NO DOUBT
YOU ARE RIGHT,
BUT WE DO HAVE
AN AGREEMENT, YES?
YES.
TRIPLE RATES...
AND CARTHAGE.
- AND SPAIN.
- SPAIN?
YOU CAN'T HAVE SPAIN.
OH?
OH, THAT'S A SHAME.
NO DEAL THEN.
- REALLY, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY--
- NO DEAL.
OH, BRAVA, MY LOVE!
VENISON FOR DINNER, THEN?
PLEASANT VOYAGE
HOME, BOYS.
GET HIM OUT
OF HERE.
I'LL SHOW YOU
TO YOUR QUARTERS.
- IS HE ALWAYS LIKE THAT?
- LIKE WHAT?
WELL, IF THAT DOESN'T MAKE
THE LITTLE SHIT DECLARE WAR,
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WILL.
HE'S A CAUTIOUS BEAST.
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
SIMPLY CUT THE CORD
AND DECLARE WAR
YOURSELF.
DECLARE WAR...
ON OCTAVIAN?
ON MY MOST TRUSTED
AND BELOVED COLLEAGUE?
ON ROME?
ON MY OWN PEOPLE?
NO NO NO.
NO, THAT WOULDN'T DO.
WHEN I RETURN HOME
IT WILL BE AS
A SAVIOR,
NOT AS A CONQUEROR.
I'M VERY TIRED.
HELIOS.
SELENE, OFF WITH YOU.
OFF WITH YOU.
CAN'T YOU SEE
YOUR FATHER NEEDS TO SLEEP?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
STAY.
YOU CAN HEAR THEM.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
BAKE 'EM A CAKE?
OH, DIS.
I FORGET SOMETIMES
WHAT A COLD-HEARTED
BITCH YOU REALLY ARE.
WOULD YOU HAVE ME
ANY OTHER WAY?
ARE YOU JOKING?
ANYONE OFFERS
ME A GOOD HORSE WITH
THE LEATHERS THROWN IN...
-
- ...YOU'RE GONE.
Man:
LET HIM THROUGH.
CLEAR THE WAY.
Man:
SILENCE.
- SILENCE!
-
THE DAY'S RATION
HAS BEEN GIVEN.
THERE'LL BE NO MORE
UNTIL TOMORROW
AT THE APPOINTED TIME.
All:
NO!
I KNOW YOU'RE HUNGRY.
BUT YOU'RE ALIVE.
YOU'LL BE WELL-FED TODAY
AND STARVING TOMORROW.
GO HOME.
GO HOME AND SUFFER WHAT
THE EARTH MOTHER HAS SENT US.
AND COME BACK TOMORROW.
RIGHT.
STILL IN ONE
PIECE THEN, EH?
THOUGHT THEY MIGHT
HAVE ATE YOU.
TOO MUCH GRISTLE
ON THE BONE.
LUCIUS, GIRLS,
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
TO WAIT INSIDE.
I'LL NOT COWER
WHEN THERE'S BLOOD
TO BE SPILLED.
WHERE'S THE HONOR
IN THAT?
WHEN YOU'VE GOT HAIR
ON YOUR CHIN YOU CAN
TALK OF BLOOD.
VORENA, I EXPECTED BETTER.
NEXT TIME DO AS YOU'RE TOLD.
THEY'RE JUST HUNGRY PEOPLE.
THEY'D NOT HURT US.
HUNGRY PEOPLE
DO STRANGE THINGS.
THEN BLESSED ORBONA
WILL PROTECT US.
WELL, RUN ALONG AND ASK HER
TO SEND A GRAIN SHIP.
ME AND MASCIUS
HAVE TO TALK.
YOU TOO, LUCIUS.
GO LEARN TO READ
OR SOMETHING.
HA!
WHAT'S THE TALLY?
RATION, GIVE OR TAKE.
GODS BELOW.
HARDLY WORTH
GIVING OUT.
JUST PROLONGING
THE MISERY.
MORNING.
THE BAKERS' GUILD MAN
WAS 'ROUND EARLIER.
I TOLD YOU NOT
TO SPEAK TO THEM.
NOR DID I.
HE SPOKE,
I SAID NOTHING.
THEY'RE OFFERING
600 A SACK.
YEAH, 600 AND A FEW
DEAD CHILDREN
FOR EVERY SACK THAT
DOESN'T GET TO THE PEOPLE
THAT NEED THEM.
WE'RE NOT IN
THIS FOR PROFIT.
STILL, IT'S 600.
I PISS ON
THE BAKERS' GUILD.
- YOUR CALL.
- YES, IT IS.
WHY ARE YOU WASTING
VALUABLE FOOD ON HIM STILL?
LET THE POOR BASTARD DIE.
MEMMIO?
NO.
HE REMINDS THE OTHER
MEN TO STAY HONEST.
WHAT'S TO BE DONE,
THEN?
FETCH MY BEST CLOTHES.
I'LL SEE IF HIS HONOR
HAS ANY IDEAS.
HEY!
QUIET, YOU.
- EH!
-
YOU FUCKING
HAIRY BASTARD.
SO FAR IT'S JUST THE OLD
AND THE SICK THAT ARE DYING.
BUT BY NEXT MOON,
OUR GRANARIES WILL BE EMPTY.
I UNDERSTAND THAT DOGS
MAKE GOOD EATING.
THEY DO.
TASTE LIKE PORK IF
YOU COOK 'EM RIGHT.
-
- AH, I WONDERED
WHY THE NIGHTS
WERE SO PEACEFUL.
-NO BARKING.
- THIS IS NO MOMENT FOR WIT.
I WISH THERE WERE
SOMETHING I COULD DO.
BUT THE STATE GRANARIES
ARE NEAR AS EMPTY AS YOURS.
I CAN ONLY GIVE TO YOU BY
TAKING FROM SOMEONE ELSE.
THE MILITARY SILOS
ARE UNTAPPED.
AND THE ARMY NEEDS TO EAT.
WELL THEN, SEND THREE
LEGIONS TO AFRICA.
LET LEPIDUS FEED THEM.
HAVE IT DONE.
IT'S ONLY A TEMPORARY
SOLUTION, BUT IT'S THE BEST
WE CAN OFFER.
- I'LL SEND YOU
WHAT WE CAN SPARE.
- THANK YOU.
PULLO.
TELL ME WHAT
THE PEOPLE ARE SAYING.
TELL ME WHO THEY BLAME
FOR THIS FAMINE.
YOU, THEY SAY.
NOT ANTONY?
THEY HEAR THE NEWS
READERS SAYING
THAT HE'S HOLDING BACK
THE SHIPMENTS AND ALL THAT.
BUT, WELL, IT'S ANTONY,
ISN'T IT?
THEY'VE ALWAYS LOVED HIM
AND HE'S ALWAYS LOVED
TO BE LOVED.
WHEREAS YOU...
WELL, YOU'RE YOU,
AREN'T YOU?
COLD AND HEARTLESS?
I'LL NOT SAY THAT.
BUT YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
THE AFFECTIONATE TYPE,
NOW HAVE YOU?
I'LL BE HEARING ABOUT
THE GRAIN THEN, WILL I?
AGRIPPA WILL
SEE TO IT.
- PERHAPS BIBULUS WILL SUCCEED?
- NO, HE WON'T.
ANTONY'S NOT
ENTIRELY IRRATIONAL.
GIVEN ENOUGH MONEY,
WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE?
ANTONY'S NOT
MOTIVATED BY MONEY.
HE HOPES THE PEOPLE
WILL RISE UP IN ANGER
AND DEPOSE ME.
EITHER THAT,
OR HE SIMPLY WISHES
TO PROVOKE ME
INTO DECLARING WAR ON HIM.
HAS HE REALLY BECOME
SO FOOLISH?
WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S BECOME
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS OUT THERE?
WHO KNOWS WHAT CLEOPATRA
WHISPERS TO HIM?
HE WAS ALWAYS A FOOL
FOR HIS WOMEN.
IF HE WANTS A WAR,
WHY NOT GIVE IT TO HIM?
HMM, YOU HEARD PULLO.
YOU MIGHT AS WELL DECLARE WAR
ON WINE AND SONG.
NO NO NO.
SEND FOR MY MOTHER
AND SISTER.
I SHALL HAVE DINNER
WITH THEM THIS EVENING.
Girl:
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
OH!
IT'S DANGEROUS.
ANTONIA,
WHERE ARE YOU?
SHE'S UP HERE WITH ME.
I'LL BRING HER DOWN.
YOU NAUGHTY GIRL.
WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU
ABOUT GOING ON THE ROOF?
I SWEAR ON DIANA, I SHALL
HAVE SOMEONE BEAT HER.
SHE DOESN'T LISTEN
TO A WORD I SAY.
OH, SHE'S A GOOD
GIRL, REALLY.  JUST LIKE
YOU WERE AT THAT AGE.
AND I TURNED OUT
SO WELL?
YOUR BROTHER, ON THE OTHER
HAND, WAS AS BIDDABLE
AS A SHEPHERD'S DOG.
NO TROUBLE AT ALL.
CASTOR, ARE THERE ANY
LETTERS FOR ME TODAY?
NO, DOMINA.
STRANGE.
I HAD THE STRONGEST FEELING
THAT TODAY WAS THE DAY.
MOTHER?
THERE WILL BE NO LETTER.
YOU'RE WRONG.
SORRY TO BE BLUNT,
BUT--
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S TIME TO FACE FACTS?
ANTONY PROMISED HE WOULD
SEND FOR ME AND HE WILL.
EVEN IF HE DID, DO YOU THINK
OCTAVIAN WOULD LET YOU GO?
I DON'T GIVE A FIG.
TRULY, IS HE WORTH TORTURING
YOURSELF LIKE THIS?
DOMINA?
OCTAVIAN CAESAR
SUMMONS YOU BOTH FOR
DINNER THIS EVENING.
WHAT DOES HE WANT NOW,
I WONDER.
NOTHING TO OUR BENEFIT.
FAMILY AND FRIENDS, EH?
NOTHING BETTER.
OCTAVIA, I HAVE A FAVOR
TO ASK OF YOU.
-
- YOU ARE AWARE OF THE GRAIN
SHORTAGE, I SUPPOSE?
YOU KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE
ARE DYING IN THE STREETS
FOR WANT OF BREAD?
AND YOU WANT ME
TO FEED THEM?
IN A MANNER
OF SPEAKING.
YOUR HUSBAND HAS PLENTY
OF GRAIN IN EGYPT.
BUT HE IS PLAYING POLITICS
WITH IT, HOLDING IT BACK.
IF YOU WERE TO
GO AND TALK TO HIM...
I?
GO TO EGYPT?
THE SOFT VOICE
OF A LOVING WIFE
MAY SUCCEED WHERE ALL
ELSE HAS FAILED.
YOU ARE JOKING!
I CANNOT REMEMBER THE LAST
TIME I MADE A JOKE.
LAST MARKET DAY.
YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT
FISHES WHICH MADE ME LAUGH
QUITE DISTINCTLY.
I WAS SPEAKING
FIGURATIVELY.
IF YOU ARE SERIOUS,
IT IS NOT I WHO SHOULD GO,
BUT MOTHER.
SHE'S HIS REAL WIFE.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
GO TOGETHER,
OH.
THAT'S ALL VERY WELL,
BUT...
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO TAKE
A LONG SEA VOYAGE.
DO YOU?
NO.
BESIDES, WE'RE NOT HUNGRY.
AND WE NEED NO GRAIN.
SO WHAT'S IN IT
FOR US?
HOW WILL YOU PAY US
FOR OUR TROUBLE?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
HMM.
POMPEII'S BECOME VULGAR.
I'D LIKE A VILLA IN CAPRI.
THAT'S FINE.
WHAT ABOUT YOU, OCTAVIA?
DO YOU WANT A VILLA?
UM, I DON'T KNOW.
SOME GLADIATORS
WOULD BE FUN AS WELL.
WHY NOT TAKE CASH
AND DECIDE LATER?
GOOD IDEA.
- CASH.
- AS YOU WISH.
MAECENAS,
HAVE THE NEWS READER
ANNOUNCE THEY ARE LEAVING
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
I LIKE BIRDS.
I DON'T LIKE EGGS.
THERE IS SOMETHING QUITE
SORDID ABOUT EGGS.
UNLESS YOU OBJECT,
OF COURSE.
WHY ARE YOU SENDING
ATIA AND OCTAVIA TO EGYPT?
YOU HEARD WHY.
WELL, YES, BUT THAT CAN'T
BE THE REAL REASON.
YOU KNOW ANTONY WILL
REFUSE WHAT THEY ASK.
IT'S VERY LIKELY.
OH.
WHAT?
YOU CALCULATE...
THAT IF ANTONY TURNS
OCTAVIA AWAY,
THE PEOPLE WILL FEEL THAT
HE HAS PUBLICLY HUMILIATED
HIS DARLING WIFE,
THAT QUEEN CLEOPATRA
HAS BEWITCHED HIM,
AND THEY WILL ALL
TURN AGAINST HIM.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,
IF ANTONY STILL LOVES ATIA
AND YIELDS TO HER PLEADING,
THEN SO MUCH THE BETTER.
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR GRAIN.
CLEVER BOY.
GOOD NIGHT, MY DEAR.
I WISH YOU'D
STOP THAT.
HAVE I CHANGED AT ALL,
DO YOU THINK,
NO.
YOU'RE JUST EXACTLY
AS YOU WERE.
DO YOU MEAN THAT?
NO.
YOU'VE BECOME
VERY MEAN, YOU KNOW.
MEAN AND BITTER.
YOU'VE BECOME GIRLISH
AND SENTIMENTAL.
- IT'S DISGUSTING, FRANKLY.
-
NO POINTS.
NO POINTS.
I WASN'T READY.
-
- HA!
WELL DONE, MAJESTY.
WELL DONE.
- READY?
- NO, WAIT!
I BEG THEE!
WAIT!
USELESS OLD WOMAN.
GO AWAY.
VORENUS,
PLAY WITH ME.
THROW IT PROPERLY.
COME ON, THEN.
GOOD CATCH.
TELL ME MORE
ABOUT MY FATHER.
YOU'VE TOLD ME ONLY WHAT
EVERY FOOL KNOWS.
HE WAS A GREAT
SOLDIER,
THE PEOPLE LOVED HIM,
BLAH BLAH BLAH.
TELL ME WHAT
HE WAS LIKE AS A MAN.
WELL, HE WAS--
HE WAS A GOOD MAN.
HE WAS A GOOD MAN
TO HAVE AS A FRIEND.
YOU WOULDN'T WANT HIM
AS AN ENEMY.
HE HAD A NASTY TEMPER
WHEN HE WAS ROUSED.
WHEN THE BATTLE WAS GOING HARD
AND MEN WERE FALTERING,
THAT'S WHEN YOU'D WANT TO SEE
YOUR FATHER AT YOUR SIDE.
BRAVEST MAN
I'VE EVER KNOWN.
MORE.
FINE HORSEMAN.
BAD GAMBLER,
THOUGH HE'D NEVER ADMIT IT.
HE LIKED THE WOMEN.
HE LIKED TO EAT.
REALLY?
I'VE ALWAYS HEARD
HE WAS VERY...
ABSTEMIOUSN HIS DIET.
YEAH, WELL,
THAT WOULD BE RIGHT.
THERE'S OTHERS KNEW HIM
FAR BETTER THAN I DID.
WHERE ARE THEY?
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
HERE?
THEIR SHIP DOCKED
ANOUR AGO.
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY
TO THE PALACE NOW.
AND THEY REQUEST AN IMMEDIATE
AUDIENCE WITH YOU!
HOW DELICIOUS.
WIFE AND LOVER COME
TOTHER TO SEE YOU.
HUSH, WOMAN.
- WHAT DO THEY WANT?
- I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT SHALL I TELL THEM?
THEY WILL BE HERE.
JUST, GIVE-- GIVE--
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE COME
OF THEIR OWN ACCORD.
OCTAVIAN MUST HAVE
SENT THEM HERE.
SENT THEM
TO DO WHAT?
OH, WHY ELSE
SEND MY WIFE
EXCEPT TO EFFECT
SOME KIND OF...
RECONCILIATION.
WELL, YOU MUST
REFUSE HER.
OBVIOUSLY, YES.
HMM, BUT THAT--
THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT HE WANTS.
BETWEEN HER AND--
AND YOU.
AND WHEN I TURN HER AWAY,
WHICH I WILL,
HE WILL HAVE
HIS PREMISE FOR WAR.
THEN WHY SO GLUM?
YOU HAVE WHAT YOU WANTED.
A WAR THAT HE WILL START,
A WAR THAT YOU
DID NOT SEEK.
STILL, I...
I DO NOT LIKE IT.
HA, HE IS--
HE IS STRIKING
AT MY SUPPORT
AMONGST THE PEOPLE.
HE-- HE WILL THINK
HE HAS OUTMANEUVERED ME.
WHAT MATTER?
AS LONG AS YOU
WIN THE WAR.
YES.
- I SUPPOSE SO.
- IN ANY CASE...
- WE MUST BE GRACIOUS
HOSTS, NAY?
- HM?
WE SHALL THROW A LOVELY
PARTY FOR THEM.
CHARMIAN, SEND FOR
THE KITCHEN CHAMBERLAIN.
NO NO NO.
NO!
NO?
WE MUST BE HOSPITABLE.
Antony:
YOU'D LOVE THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU?
HUH?
HUMILIATING ATIA.
HMM?
WATCHING HER SQUIRM
AS YOU PLAY THE QUEEN.
PLAY THE QUEEN?
I AM A QUEEN.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
NO.
NO, I DON'T.
YOU--
YOU JUST WANT TO
FLAUNT OUR LOVE
IN FRONT OF HER.
WHY NOT?
WE LOVE EACH OTHER,
DON'T WE?
AND YOU NO LONGER
LOVE HER.
WHY SHOULD SHE
NOT KNOW IT?
IT'S AN ACT OF KINDNESS.
STOP HER PINING
FOR YOU.
I'M NOT WRONG,
AM I?
YOU DO NO LONGER
LOVE HER.
OF COURSE
I NO LONGER LOVE HER.
YOU KNOW I NO LONGER
LOVE HER.
BUT NEITHER DO I THINK
SHE DESERVES PUBLIC
HUMILIATION.
THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT.
THAT IS WHY THEY'RE HERE,
TO BE HUMILIATED.
NO, I DON'T
THINK SHE KNOWS THAT.
ELSE SHE WOULD
NOT BE HERE.
I THINK
HER FUCKING SON
HAS MANIPULATED
HER INTO IT.
LET'S KILL THEM THEN.
WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
ATIA WILL NOT
BE HUMILIATED...
BECAUSE ATIA
WILL BE DEAD.
OCTAVIAN WILL KNOW THAT
YOU'RE NOT A MAN
TO BE OUTMANEUVERED.
IT'S PERFECT.
NO.  MY PEOPLE WILL
DESPISE ME AS A WIFE-KILLER.
WELL, THEIR SHIP SANK
ON THE WAY HOME.
- NO.
- IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
NO.  I MEAN IT.
NO!
I SEE.  WELL, I THINK
YOU ARE A COWARD!
HA!
OR YOU STILL
HAVE FEELINGS FOR HER.
-
- WHICH IS IT?
HM?
WHICH IS IT?
WHY DON'T YOU SHUT
YOUR FUCKING MOUTH?
GODS, WHAT
A GHASTLY PLACE.
BIG, THOUGH.
IT'S A SURE SIGN
OF VULGARITY.
PTOLEMIES WERE ORIGINALLY
GOAT-HERDS, YOU KNOW?
WHY ARE THE DOORS
NOT OPEN?
AH!
AH!  NO!
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.
THE RUDENESS.
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW--
VULGAR.
ROYALTY, INDEED.
THIS HEAT'S UNBEARABLE.
I THINK I'M GOING
TO FAINT.
YOU WOULD THINK THEY
WOULD BRING US WATER.
- CAN'T WE GO BACK TO THE SHIP?
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.
WE'RE STAYING HERE
UNTIL THESE WRETCHED PEOPLE...
OH, ABOUT BLOODY TIME.
HELLO.
JOCASTA.
IS IT YOU?
OF COURSE IT'S ME.
WHO ELSE WOULD I BE?
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU?
OH, THIS?
HER MAJESTY DOESN'T LIKE
THE ROMAN STYLE ON HER WOMEN.
QUITE IRRATIONAL ABOUT
THE SUBJECT IF YOU ASK ME.
BUT ANYTHING FOR
A QUIET LIFE, EH?
I RATHER LIKE IT NOW.
THAT'S WHAT I CALL IT ANYWAY.
I CAN'T GET MY MOUTH
AROUND THEIR LINGO.
SHE WILL SHRIEK.
BUT I JUST PRETEND
I'M A LITTLE MAD,
AND SHE LEAVES OFF.
WHY IS THE DOOR KEPT SHUT?
WHY IS THERE NO ONE HERE
TO GREET US?
OH, I'M SURE THERE'LL BE
SOMEONE ALONG IN A WHILE.
THINGS MOVE...
EVER SO SLOW AROUND HERE.
IT'S THE HEAT.
LISTEN, WHY DON'T YOU
GO INSIDE
AND TELL ANTONY THAT
WE'RE WAITING TO SEE HIM?
OBVIOUSLY, HE'S NOT BEEN
INFORMED THAT WE'RE HERE.
I COULDN'T DO THAT.
NO ONE'S ALLOWED TO
SPEAK TO ANTONY WITHOUT
SHE SAYS SO.
EXCEPT MY DEAR
LITTLE POSCA.
AND LUCIUS VORENUS,
OF COURSE.
I LOVE YOUR HAIR LIKE THAT.
IS THAT HOW PEOPLE ARE
WEARING IT NOW?
OH, THANK JUNO.
POSCA.
WHAT IN HEAVEN'S
NAME IS--
Posca:
- I WAS ONLY--
- QUIET, WOMAN!
SCA,
WHERE'S ANTONY?
YES, YES!
A GREAT PLEASURE.
INDEED, YES.
COME ALONG.
POSCA?
POSCA?
THANK YOU.
THEY'VE ALL GONE INSANE.
IT'S FOR THE BEST,
YOU KNOW.
THIS PALACE LIFE
IS NO GOOD FOR YOU.
YOU NEED ACTION.
YEAH.
YOU'LL BE MUCH MORE HAPPY
WHEN THE WAR BEGINS.
- VORENUS.
- SIR.
I HAVE A DELICATE
MISSION FOR YOU.
OH, I'M GLAD TO SEE
YOU HAVEN'T GONE NATIVE,
AT LEAST.
PERHAPS YOU CAN
TALK SOME SENSE.
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH THESE PEOPLE?
WHY HASN'T ANTONY BEEN
TOLD OF OUR ARRIVAL?
I'VE BEEN ORDERED BY
TRIUMVIR MARK ANTONY
TO ESCORT YOU BOTH BACK
TO YOUR SHIP,
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU
LEAVE ALEXANDRIA AS SOON
AS THE WIND ALLOWS.
WITHOUT SEEING HIM?
HE TURNS AWAY
THE MOTHER OF HIS CHILD?
THAT'S CORRECT.
IT WAS SHE WHO ORDERED YOU
TO DO THIS, WASN'T IT?
ANTONY WOULDN'T ACT
SOOW.
I TAKE ORDERS ONLY FROM
MARK ANTONY, MADAM.
NO, WE'RE NOT GOING.
- MOTHER, I--
- MADAM?
WE ARE NOT GOING.
I AM NOT MOVING
FROM THIS SPOT
UNLESS ANTONY COMES DOWN
HIMSELF AND TELLS ME TO GO.
IF YOU WILL NOT GO WILLINGLY,
I HAVE BEEN GIVEN ORDERS
YOU WOULD MANHANDLE
THE WOMEN OF THE JULII?
NO, BUT THESE MEN HERE...
THEY HAVE NO
SUCH SCRUPLES.
- ANTONY!
- MADAM.
COME DOWN, YOU BASTARD!
MADAM, PLEASE!
YOU TELL MY HUSBAND
THAT HE'S COWARDLY SCUM.
TELL HIM THAT.
YOU REALIZE, OF COURSE,
WE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE ALL
OUR MONEY BEHIND.
- I DON'T CARE!
- WE'RE PENNILESS.
I'M SCARED.
I WANT TO GO HOME.
PLEASE, HURRY.
- GOING SOMEWHERE?
- NO.
NO, WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK THAT?
PLEASE, VORENUS.
DON'T TELL.
PLEASE DON'T TELL.
HAVE MERCY
ON US.
THEY'LL KILL US.
THEY'LL THROW US
TO THE CROCODILES.
MY WIFE IS
OVERWROUGHT.
WE WERE MERELY GOING TO TAKE
A STROLL ALONG THE HARBOR
TO LOOK AT THE SHIPS.
THEN YOU MUST HURRY.
THE WIND IS CHANGING.
THE SHIPS LOOK BEST WHEN
THE SAILS ARE SET.
COME WITH US.
NO.
WAR IS SURE TO
COME NOW.
THIS IS NO PLACE
FOR DECENT ROMANS.
TRUE, BUT I HAVE
RESPONSIBILITIES HERE.
NOW IS THE TIME.
IF YOU HAPPEN TO SEE
TITUS PULLO,
ASK HIM TO KISS
MY CHILDREN FOR ME.
I WILL DO THAT.
THANK YOU.
HELLO, AGAIN.
Posca:
WOULD YOU MIND AWFULLY
IF WE HIDE HERE
UNTIL THIS BOAT
IS AT SEA?
I'VE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING
I REMEMBER.
THERE MUST BE
MORE THAN THAT.
LOOK TO YOURSELF.
YOU ARE WHAT
REMAINS OF HIM.
VORENUS.
WELL?
THEY'RE GONE.
GOOD.
GOOD.
AND HOW IS...
ATIA?
I SUPPOSE SHE TOOK IT
WITH HER USUAL POISE?
NO.
NO?
OH.
WELL.
HAD TO BE DONE.
WHERE'S POSCA?
I SENT FOR HIM
BUT HE DID NOT COME.
I DON'T KNOW, SIR.
DO YOU WISH ME TO GO
AND LOOK FOR HIM?
OH, NO NO.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M SURE HE'LL TURN UP.
SIR, YOUR WIFE INSTRUCTED ME
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
OH?
SHE INSTRUCTED ME
TO TELL YOU
THAT YOU
ARE COWARDLY SCUM.
SHE DID, DID SHE?
OH.  AND--
AND WHAT'S YOUR
OPINION OF THAT?
IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO HAVE
AN OPINION, SIR.
NAH.
TELL ME ANYWAY.
IS THAT AN ORDER?
YES.
THAT'S AN ORDER.
YOU'RE NO COWARD.
BUT YOU DO HAVE A STRONG
DISEASE IN YOUR SOUL.
A DISEASE THAT WILL
EAT AWAY AT YOU...
UNTIL YOU DIE.
REALLY?
HMM.
AND WHAT IS THIS DISEASE?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT A DOCTOR.
NO.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
SO HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE
OF YOUR DIAGNOSIS, THEN?
I RECOGNIZE
YOUR SYMPTOMS.
I HAVE THE SAME SICKNESS.
HMM.
LONG ONE.
HELLO, MOTHER.
AND POSCA.
WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE.
I GATHER ANTONY WAS NOT
AMENABLE TO PERSUASION.
NO, HE WAS NOT.
BUT YOU KNEW THAT,
DIDN'T YOU?
YOU WANTED A VILLA
IN CAPRI.
NOW YOU MAY HAVE ONE.
IS OCTAVIA WELL?
POSCA HAS SOMETHING HERE
THAT WILL HELP YOU
DESTROY ANTONY.
- MOTHER, I AM HOPING--
- CRUSH ANTONY AND HIS QUEEN.
AND YOU CAN KEEP
YOUR DAMN VILLA.
YOU HAVE SOMETHING
FOR ME, POSCA?
IT IS THE LAST
WILL AND TESTAMENT
OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA.
TO BE OPENED AND READ ONLY ON
THE OCCASION OTHEIR DEATH.
IT IS A DESPICABLE
DOCUMENT.
TAKEN TOGETHER WITH HIS
REPUDIATION OF YOUR SISTER,
THE ROMAN PEOPLE WOULD THINK
A WAR AGAINST ANTONY
NOT ONLY INEVITABLE
BUT EMINENTLY DESIRABLE.
- IS IT GENUINE?
- IT IS GENUINE.
YOU ARE A GOOD
AND LOYAL FRIEND, POSCA.
THIS ONE HAS COOKED
HIMSELF FOR DINNER.
HE ASKS TO BE BURIED
IN ALEXANDRIA.
HE DECLARES CLEOPATRA
HIS WIFE AND THAT THEY
ARE LIVING GODS.
- IT'S PERFECT.
-
HE LEAVES TO HIS
CHILDREN BY CLEOPATRA
ALL THE EASTERN PROVINCES.
AND HER SON BY CAESAR
IS TO BE GIVEN
ROME AND THE WEST.
HAVING REJECTED
HIS LOVING WIFE, OCTAVIA,
MARK ANTONY HAS COUPLED
HIMSELF TO THE SORCERESS
CLEOPATRA, PROMISING HER
DOMINION OF ALL ROME!
HE WORSHIPS DOGS
AND REPTILES.
HE BLACKENS HIS EYES
WITH SOOT
LIKE A PROSTITUTE.
HE DANCES AND PLAYS
THE CYMBALS
IN VILE NILOTIC RITES.
I KNOW HOW UNHAPPY YOU ARE
AND I CANNOT BLAME YOU.
FOR WHO WOULD NOT WEEP
WHEN HE HEARS THAT THE GREAT
MARK ANTONY
PAYS HOMAGE
TO FOREIGN GODS?
THAT HE HAS ABANDONED
HIS WIFE,
HIS CHILD
AND HIS COUNTRY?
I AM ASKED IF
HE IS GONE MAD,
IF HE IS BEWITCHED.
I HAVE NO EXPLANATION.
WE MAY WEEP FOR HIM,
BUT THEN WE MUST DO OUR DUTY,
FOR HE IS NO LONGER
A ROMAN, BUT AN EGYPTIAN.
AND WHAT IS LEFT FOR US
TO DO BUT FIGHT HIM?
FIGHT HIM
AND DESTROY HIM!
PULLO.
SIR.
COME, SIT DOWN.
POSCA TELLS ME
OUR FRIEND VORENUS
STANDS BY ANTONY
EVEN NOW.
LOYAL MAN, VORENUS.
HE SENDS YOU
HIS BEST REGARDS,
ASKED THAT YOUISS
HIS CHILDREN FOR HIM.
- HE'S ALL RIGHT, IS HE?
- YOU KNOW HIM.
-
- YOU AND HE ARE
STILL FRIENDS, THEN?
YES.
VERY SOON I WILL HAVE
TO GO EAST
TO END THIS
THING WITH ANTONY.
I WANT YOU
TO COME WITH ME.
- WHY?
- YOU ARE CLOSE TO VORENUS.
HE IS CLOSE TO ANTONY.
IT MAY BE YOU CAN ACT
AS A MEDIATOR.
NOT TO ARGUE WITH YOU,
BUT IT DOESN'T
SEEM LIKELY.
THERE ARE SOME WILL
HAVE TO DIE, OF COURSE.
ANTONY CANNOT BE SAVED.
- THE BOY CAESARIO
WILL HAVE TO GO, OBVIOUSLY.
- CAESARION?
THEY HAVE NAMED HIM PUTATIVE
KING OF ROME, PULLO.
HE WILL HAVE TO DIE.
BUT PERHAPS CLEOTRA
AND HER CHILDREN BY ANTONY
MAY BE SAVED.
-
- YES.
I SEE.
I DO NOT WANT
TO ORDER YOU TO COME, PULLO,
BUT I WILL IF I HAVE TO.
NO.
NO PROBLEM.
I'LL COME.
GOOD.
IT WILL BE LIKE
OLD TIMES.
AN ADVENTURE TOGETHER.
SO, ANTONY MORE OR LESS
FORCED OCTAVIAN INTO WAR.
ELSE THE EAST WOULD BE
LOST TO THE GYPOS.
WE WOULDN'T WANT THAT,
NOW WOULD WE?
WORSHIPPING A BUNCH
OF DOGS AND CATS
AND WHAT HAVE YOU.
ANYROAD,
THE THING IS,
OCTAVIAN'S ORDERED ME
TO GO ALONG WITH HIM.
SO THAT'S WHAT
I'LL BE DOING--
GOING ALONG WITH HIM.
- CAN I COME WITH YOU?
- NO.  SORRY.
YOU STAY HERE
WITH ME, HMM?
WE'LL BE FINE.
YOU'LL HARDLY NOTICE
I'M GONE.
AND THE GOOD NEWS IS,
I'M MORE THAN LIKELY
TO SEE YOUR FATHER.
HE SENT WORD THAT I SHOULD
GIVE YOU ALL A KISS FROM HIM.
IF I SEE HIM, CAN I GIVE HIM
A KISS FROM YOU IN RETURN?
NO.
HE KILLED OUR MOTHER.
IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?
YOU'RE A HARD ONE,
YOU.
MY FATHER MADE ME SO.
I HEAR YOU.
WHILE I'M AWAY,
THERE'LL BE NO TROUBLE
BETWEEN YOU.
NO SKIMMING FROM
THE GRAIN RATION,
NO STEALING OF WOMEN,
NOR ANY EXTORTION,
ROBBERY, OR ARSON--
UNLESS UNDER DIRECT
LICENSE BY MASCIUS.
ANYBODY STEPS OUT OF LINE,
THEY'LL BE SHARING THEIR
DINNER WITH MEMMIO.
DON'T FORGET
YOUR VINEGAR FLASK.
MM, RIGHT.
GIVE US A SMILE, EH?
WON'T BE GONE FOREVER.
IF YOU REALLY LOVED ME,
YOU'D TAKE ME WITH YOU.
IT'S A WAR,
NOT A SHOPPING TRIP.
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF.
I KNOW YOU CAN.
WHICH IS WHY I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT LEAVING YOU HERE.
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING NOW?
VINEGAR.
MEMMIO?
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
WHAT HAVE I DONE?
WHY ARE YOU
PUNISHING ME LIKE THIS?
OH, YOU SELFISH BASTARD.
IT'S ME WHO'S DYING,
NOT YOU WHO'S BEING
PUNISHED.
IT'S ME.
I'M GONNA DIE.
IT IS AS--
AS IT SHOULD BE.
WHAT HAVE YOU
EVER DONE?
YOU'RE A GOOD WOMAN.
OH, DON'T GET
SENTIMENTAL ON ME NOW.
ONE THING I'M NOT
IS A GOOD WOMAN.
YOU'VE BEEN
GOOD TO ME.
NO, I HAVEN'T.
EIRENE.
EIRENE WAS A GOOD WOMAN.
NOT A SHE-WOLF
LIKE ME.
SHE HAD HER MOMENTS.
SHE WAS GONNA
GIVE YOU A CHILD.
FATE HAD
A DIFFERENT PLAN.
WE'RE HAPPY ENOUGH,
YOU AND ME.
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T GO TO THE AFTERLIFE
WITH LIES IN MY HEART.
NEMESIS WON'T
LET ME REST.
WHAT LIES?
WHAT'S NEMESIS
WANT WITH YOU?
SEND THESE PEOPLE AWAY.
GET OUT.
REMEMBER WHEN I'M GONE,
WHAT I DID,
I DID OUT OF
LOVE FOR YOU.
DID WHAT?
IT WAS ME...
WHO KILLED EIRENE
AND YOUR CHILD.
I WANTED YOU
FOR MYSELF.
SO I POISONED HER.
GOODBYE, LOVE.
