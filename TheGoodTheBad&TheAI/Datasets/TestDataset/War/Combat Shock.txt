FRANKIE : I go back
there every night without fail.
The events will
happen all over again.
I know it isn't real,
but the terror is real.
It's part of me now,
and I can't escape it.
Everything is
exactly as I remember
It, the same jungle, the
same paths, the same victims.
We were sent to Da
Nang, on routine search
And seizure patrols.
We'd enter villages and
interrogate prisoners.
Me and Colby always scouted
ahead to warn if there
Was any guerrilla activity.
But something happened.
I can't remember what.
It all looks the same.
I can't tell one
place from another.
Somehow I've got to get back.
This place looks familiar.
I've been here before.
Colby!
Jackson!
FRANKIE :
I knew it wasn't them.
And now they know I'm onto it.
I don't know how long
he's been following me.
I don't know who he is.
I only know he wants to kill me.
I remember her face so
clearly... here eyes and mouth.
She's so beautiful.
And yet why is she
trying to destroy me?
She's leading them against me.
I keep telling myself,
she's just a girl.
The pressure!
No, she's the enemy.
I have to kill her.
I'm just a kid.
I can't take it anymore!
I'm a hero.
God help me.
He's hungry.
There's no more food.
.
I can't take much more of this.
Much more of what?
This.
Living like rats.
I'm starving.
The baby's starving.
So I'm hungry too.
Then do something about it.
What do you want me to do?
Get a job.
There are no jobs.
- Look for one.
- I am.
It's not just me.
It's the whole country.
Well, the country
manages to eat.
You roam the streets
like a zombie.
You're not looking for a job.
You're waiting for
the world to end.
Hey, that should
be any day now.
Go ahead, make jokes.
But it's true.
You don't care about us.
You're off on another
planet somewhere.
It's not fair.
It's just not fair.
Get him out of here!
We need a doctor for him.
It's not right the way
he's always crying.
He never stops.
Hey, I can't
afford to feed him.
How am I going to pay a doctor?
Listen to him.
He's your son.
Oh, don't hand me that.
Only you could
have created this.
Bullshit!
They said it was inconclusive.
Well, what did you
expect them to say?
You knew what it
was like out there.
You knew what you
were exposed to.
You didn't tell me.
Well, what was
I gonna tell you?
They didn't tell us nothing.
And they wouldn't
spray their own men.
Oh, listen to GI Joe.
MAN : Frankie!
Frankie!
Come back!
Do you live in a barn?
Hey, we got some milk left.
WOMAN : Occupant.
After repeated
correspondence, you
Have chosen to remain
delinquent concerning your rent.
This situation is
no longer tolerable,
And therefore your
lease has been voided.
Vacate the premises by 6:00 PM.
A failure to do so will
result in your arrest.
How long has he been
in captivity, doctor?
Two years.
He's lucky he's not a vegetable.
Not too much physical damage.
Can't remember anything, though.
Look at those marks on his arm.
FRANKIE : What
does she expect me to do?
It's not my fault
things are like this.
I mean, what happened?
This isn't supposed
to happen here.
Something fucked up.
You know, today is one of
those days when anything
That can go wrong does.
All right, Frankie.
Where you been, huh, fucker?
You've been avoiding me,
but now I want my money.
I'm gonna pay
you, Paco, I swear.
I just need a little more time.
You're god damn right,
you're going to pay me.
What do you want, a broken arm?
Yeah, let's break his arm.
No, Paco.
Come on, I swear.
Please, just till tomorrow.
I just need...
Just till tomorrow.
I swear, I'll pay you then.
Come on, let me
break his fucking arm.
And where you gonna
get that kind of money?
Come on, you're not going
to listen to this shit.
Let him break his arm.
Come here, shit stain.
You see the position I'm in?
If I let you get away
with shit like this,
I lose the respect
of my friends.
And with friends like that, I
can't afford to lose respect.
It's always the
same with you guys.
You know, you were happy
enough to take the money.
But now you've got
to pay your debts.
I just can't make the vig.
You should have thought
about that before.
This ain't no charity.
Now, you listen,
you get that money.
I don't care how, but
you better get it.
And anything that you don't pay
off your wife will work off.
You leave my wife out of this.
That little boy of yours
ought to bring a nice price
On the open market.
How old is he, a year old,
and he still can't sit up?
Yeah, he'd make a great
exhibit in a freak show.
They pay extra for retards.
No shit.
Sure.
It's a delicacy to
fuck retarded kids.
Top dollar, man.
You see, Frankie?
We're gonna get the
money one way or another.
Either you pay, or
your family does.
Come on.
Tomorrow, Frankie.
I want the cash tomorrow.
FRANKIE :
I could never
Get the money he wants by then.
And he knows that.
He makes it impossible to
pay so he can destroy me.
Well, we'll see, prick-o.
But
Don't move, or you're dead.
Frankie, I didn't
know it was you, man.
Mike, what the
fuck were you doing?
Oh, man.
You gotta help me.
I need money bad.
- I don't have anything.
- Anything, man.
You gotta have something.
Man, I got nothing.
My fucking wife's
home waiting for me.
She's starving.
I feel like I'm gonna explode.
I can't take it anymore.
All right, take it easy, Mike.
Come on, rest a little.
No, no.
I gotta move.
It hurts less when I'm moving.
That's right.
Cough it out.
You'll be all right.
I cough, man.
There's nothing in my system.
I haven't eaten in three days.
Mike, I thought you
kicked that shit.
Yeah, tell me about...
Tell me about it.
Yeah, I know, but what
do you want me to say.
I mean, look at you.
Hey, look at you.
Who the fuck are you to be
telling people how to live?
Hey, look, do what
the fuck you want.
You know, I personally
don't give a shit.
Wait.
I didn't mean that, man.
I'm sorry.
Let's walk.
Just do me a favor.
Don't pull any shit
with me around.
Have you seen Paco?
Yeah, I just saw him.
He's sure been looking for me.
He's looking for everybody.
He owns everybody.
At least his family does.
You know, he wouldn't be shit if
it wasn't for his brother, man.
That's the animal...
Animal to avoid.
I never met his brother.
Well, you're lucky.
fucking
time of day, man.
He's a real fuck, you know that?
One time... one time this guy
was yelling at his brother, man.
I don't know, he got into
an accident or something,
Ran over his fucking toe.
Hey, wait.
There's somebody.
Hey, you want a
piece of this, man?
I'll split it with you.
No, Mike.
I'll pass.
You sure?
Mike, it's not the
way to do things.
You're gonna wind up in jail.
What choices do I have?
I'll take my chances.
I need $100 a day to survive.
Where am I gonna
get money like that?
You think I like doing this?
I'm better off in jail.
Mike, if I get any
money, I'll give you some.
FRANKIE :
Sometimes I feel
Like I'm oozing out of my
body, like I don't belong here.
And my mind forces
me somewhere else.
I can't stop it because it's
so real that I believe it.
I hear it.
I smell it.
I can see it.
It's so fucking cold.
Oh, god.
Now I know why they
didn't kill me.
Dead?
What... but what
about other people?
OLDER MAN :
There are no other people.
There's only room
for one at the top.
You remember that.
YOUNGER FRANKIE
: I don't
Know if I agree with that.
OLDER MAN :
Well, you better
Agree with that, because
that's the way the world is.
YOUNGER FRANKIE :
But he's my friend.
OLDER MAN :
I don't care.
You're not to associate
with his kind anymore.
YOUNGER FRANKIE :
What's his kind?
OLDER MAN :
Cut it out.
You know what I'm talking about.
YOUNGER FRANKIE
: You can't
Judge everybody by their color.
OLDER MAN : Now,
don't tell me how to live.
You're not going to be seen
hanging around with niggers.
And you're being pig-headed.
You could be set for life.
YOUNGER FRANKIE : I
don't want to be set for life.
OLDER MAN :
That's the most
Ridiculous thing I ever heard.
YOUNGER FRANKIE
: Why?
I don't want to do it.
I don't enjoy it.
OLDER MAN : Whoever
said life was enjoyable?
YOUNGER FRANKIE
: I don't care.
I'm gonna marry her.
OLDER MAN :
You better care.
She's only after the money.
YOUNGER FRANKIE :
I don't have any money.
OLDER MAN :
She wants my money!
YOUNGER FRANKIE :
That's bullshit.
She loves me.
OLDER MAN : You're
a fool, and she's using you.
Don't you ever talk
to me like that!
YOUNGER FRANKIE
: Oh, fuck you.
You're not my father.
You never were a father to me.
You're a piece of shit.
OLDER MAN : Don't
you ever talk to me like that!
YOUNGER FRANKIE
: I'll kill you!
FRANKIE :
I can no longer
Tell where one torture
ends and the next begins.
OLDER MAN : I'll
cut you off from everything!
You'll starve!
The
What do you got for me, Mike?
Something.
I got something good.
That's nice.
It makes business
so much smoother.
Here it is.
Wait a minute.
Let me see what you're
trying to pawn on me.
It's worth at least 100.
Why not 1,000?
No, wait.
Let's make it 5,000.
What about a million?
It's worth at least that much.
Right, asshole?
Yeah, that's it.
It's worth a million.
It's a million.
Shut up.
What do you guys
provoke him for?
It only makes him worse.
This is costume jewelry, Mike.
It's paste.
It's shit.
It's worthless, you understand?
I'll give you $10 for it.
Give him a 60-bag.
No, come on, Paco.
I need the 100.
Come on, I'm good for it.
I swear.
Bullshit, you are.
I need the 100.
Come on, Paco.
I swear, I'll come back.
I'll get the money.
Come on.
You'll get the 100
when you get back.
Wait.
Here, take this.
Take this.
That's worth at least $40.
I can't accept that.
This is standard
police issue, man.
It can be traced anywhere.
What are you trying to do,
Mike, pin your crimes on me?
No, I swear.
Nothing.
No!
Down.
Look, from now on, with
you, it's cash on the line.
You know, Mike, with you,
there are always problems.
Everyone else is cool, but with
you, there's always a problem.
Do you have any
hardware I could use?
See what I mean?
Want us to inject
it for you too?
How about if I inject
it in your fucking face?
Mike, you don't understand.
You're a fucking imbecilic
pain in my fucking ass.
Now get the fuck
out of my sight.
Did you give him the shit?
Yeah, you bet.
Yo.
Got a line over here.
Get to the end of the
line, you smelly bum.
I've been waiting here all day.
Bullshit.
Yo, baby.
You want to take me to Bayonne?
Jerry?
Jerry, Jerry.
How you doing?
Good.
I'm here.
Do you have any hundred?
Why do you want it, man.
Look, I mean...
- You got some...
- No, no, no.
Listen...
Oh, you're full of shit, man.
I'm not full of shit.
Listen to me for a minute.
Listen, I just want to...
Did you get it off Paco,
because Paco owes me?
No, no, no, no, no.
It's not what you think.
It's not what you think.
Listen to me.
Look, look, look, look, look.
It's for somebody else.
Please, give me
some of it, man.
It's not for me!
Oh, please.
Look, no.
Look at me.
I know.
I'm looking.
I'll come back, all right.
You remember when I gave you?
Come on, Paco gives me too, man.
Paco owes me.
Shut the fuck up!
It's not for me!
Come on, man.
It's not for me.
Shut up.
Listen to me.
It's not for me, OK?
All right?
Listen, motherfucker.
You don't tell me to shut up.
You owe me, and I want
some of it, all right?
Would you just give
me the fucking shit?
Come on.
It's not for me.
I swear.
I swear, I'll come back.
Even if it's not for you, I
can have some of it, right?
- Why!
- Bullshit.
I don't fucking lie.
Now give me it, all right?
Sh.
Holy shit.
Please, for me.
I don't have...
I mean, you guys owe it to me.
I don't have anything.
It's not for me.
All right?
OK?
All right?
All right?
You OK?
Listen to me...
Fine, man.
Listen, I wouldn't
do this to you.
I wouldn't do this.
All right?
Stay here.
No!
I'll come back.
I'll come back.
Give me a little
bit before you leave.
Let me go!
I'll come back, I told you.
Now, stay here, all right?
Stay here.
See?
I'll come back.
I promise.
All right?
OK.
You better come back, Mike.
You better come back!
You want me to get on the end
of the line, huh, Mr. Security?
Look, pal, I don't get paid
enough to take shit off you.
You want in, you get to the end.
Back of the line!
All right, four more.
What do you mean four more?
All day it's been five.
Got no time for this!
Ain't got no check.
All right, five more.
Doesn't look any
better today, Frankie.
There's nothing here for you.
Some computer jobs.
An engineering apprenticeship.
I'll take it.
You can't.
They want experience.
You don't have the skill.
That's just the problem,
you don't have any skill.
Isn't there anything else?
Check again.
Life is hard, Frankie.
And because it is hard, I am
compelled to remove my jacket.
The waiting list for manual
labor is still two weeks long.
Why don't you go back to
school, learn a trade?
I got a family to support.
And all the Fed
programs have been cut.
What do they expect me to do?
I'm sorry.
I know.
Hey, Ray, did you
see my Veg-O-Matic?
No, I didn't touch it.
Jesus.
There's nothing I can do.
You can keep trying to come
here, or you can go to Welfare.
But I doubt they'll do anything,
because they're cutting back.
I don't know what
else to tell you.
Tell me some good news.
It's 1:30.
FRANKIE :
I can't tell how long
I've been here, days or years.
I'm not conscious long enough
to get my time oriented.
I forgot what it
feels like to be home.
All right, fuck-face.
You're gonna talk,
or you're gonna die.
I don't know anything.
I was lost.
I was running.
Bullshit.
What happened in the village?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
Yeah, well, try and remember.
I can't.
Try harder.
I can't, I tell you.
I don't remember.
I don't know anything.
Try and remember.
Just tell me what happened.
I don't know.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't kill anybody.
Oh, if you didn't kill
anybody, you wouldn't be here.
This isn't a golf course.
You're just making
it hard on yourself.
Hey, who's side are you on?
Oh, fuck.
Don't be a fool.
It wasn't enough to kill them.
You had to mutilate them.
No!
My wife was in that village!
No!
They were slaughtered
when we got there.
What do you mean?
Before I knew what happened,
the whole fucking squad
Went crazy.
Crazy?
Yeah, crazy.
How did they go crazy?
I don't know.
But you said they
were already dead.
How did they die
before you got there?
You've got to remember!
Who killed them?
Your friends?
You?
No!
Then who?
I don't know.
Yeah, they
slaughtered themselves.
I can't remember.
I don't know.
No!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Leave him alone.
Leave him alone!
Ow!
Mike!
Mike!
Mike!
Mike!
Mike!
FRANKIE : How
could I ever call him?
He was right about her.
He was right about everything.
And she expects him to
welcome us with open arms.
What?
He'll rub it in my face.
And I've taken enough
abuse for one day.
I could never call him.
He probably thinks I'm dead.
Hello?
FRANKIE : Hello.
Let me speak to Mr. Dunlan.
Who's calling, please.
FRANKIE : Tell
him it's a personal matter.
One second, please.
What does he mean
personal business?
I don't have any
personal business.
I don't know.
That's what he said.
Probably just another
collection agency.
Call me when you're through.
Hello?
FRANKIE : Hello, Dad.
Who is this?
This is Frankie.
MR. DUNLAN
: Frankie who?
Your son, Frankie.
Who is this?
Dad, it's me.
What is this, some
sort of a joke?
My son is dead.
He died in Saigon.
FRANKIE :
They thought I was dead.
I was only separated from
my squad and taken prisoner.
No, it can't be.
FRANKIE : It is, Dead.
After our release,
I was committed
To a hospital for three years.
What's that?
It's morphine.
It'll help relieve the pain.
But I'm not in any pain.
Well, then it's doing
its job, isn't it?
But I'm OK now.
I have a certificate
from the government.
But they never found my body.
I know you recognize my voice.
They say your body was
destroyed in a massacre.
It wouldn't be the first
time they were wrong.
Come on, Dad.
You know it's me.
Why?
After all these years,
you've come back to haunt me.
I'm not here to haunt you.
It's hard to explain.
I need help.
We can't make it out here.
I've been out of
work for four months.
We have no food, no anything.
We're being thrown
into the street.
MR. DUNLAN : We?
Are you still with Cathy?
Yeah.
Surprised?
MR. DUNLAN : No.
We have a baby.
A one-year-old boy.
And we're expecting
another in three months.
MR. DUNLAN :
Frankie, I'm sorry for what
Happened between us.
FRANKIE :
Forget it, Dad.
MR. DUNLAN :
We were both so stubborn.
FRANKIE : It
doesn't matter anymore.
What matters is that
I need some money.
MR. DUNLAN :
I can't help you.
FRANKIE :
I'll take anything.
No, you don't understand.
I've lost everything.
The business, my savings,
and now my health.
FRANKIE : What?
But how?
I'm waiting to die.
Everything around me is dead.
Your mother, you, soon me.
Dad, I need to talk
to you once in a while.
Frankie, there's... there's
nothing I can do for you.
I don't have any
money or position.
And I don't think I could
face the past anymore.
There's too much
time between us.
And too much pain.
I don't want to go back.
FRANKIE : I
go back every day, Dad.
Jaime.
Jaime.
Now, you cut it
out, you hear me?
I want the both of you to stay
here and none of this fighting.
You's be good.
Just cut it out.
CHILD: You are.
CHILD: You are.
CHILD: You are.
CHILD: Big fat liar!
CHILD: No, you are.
CHILD: You are.
- You are.
Shut up.
- You're a bitch.
- You're a bitch.
You are.
Big fat liar.
Shut up!
Girls, girls.
Calm down.
You shouldn't be screaming
like that in the streets.
Now, what's the matter?
Big fat baby.
I am not.
Are too.
Am not.
You are too.
You are, bitch!
Nah, nah, big fat liar.
Big fat liar.
Shut up!
You're a big fat baby.
Shut up!
Hey, come on, now,
that's not nice.
Nah, nah.
Big fat liar.
Big fat liar.
Big fat liar.
Big fat liar.
That's no way to behave.
So what?
Hey mister, you want a date?
Do I want a date?
Cut it out.
Come here, sit down.
Here, watch this.
How do you do that?
Oh, it takes years of practice,
about four years of college.
Does not.
Where's your parents?
I don't know.
Well, who do you live with?
A lot of people.
Where?
All over.
What do you mean all over?
Wherever Paco takes
me is where I live.
FRANKIE :
I should have
Known he was tied up in this.
Wherever the shit smells the
worst, he usually turns up.
She's so young.
She's just a kid.
What are you doing
with that girl?
What are you doing
with that girl?
Nothing.
Trying to take her for free?
Get your hands off of me.
Trying to take her for free?
I told you not to
leave them alone.
I ain't their mother.
I can't constantly watch
them and do my own clients.
Why don't you get a babysitter
or something for them.
You can't expect me to...
Shut up, bitch.
When I want a song and
dance, I'll get Gene Kelly.
Who's Gene Kelly?
You can go suck my ass.
Come back here, bitch.
- Can I suck your cock, honey?
- I said come back here.
Absolutely not.
Go after her.
Why not?
Now, if you want that little
girl, it'll cost you $50.
Do you have any idea what
you're doing to that kid?
Look, I do what I'm told to.
You know who to complain to.
How do you live with yourself?
Just tell me that.
Hey, get the fuck
out of here, man.
I catch you around here
again, I'll pop your head off.
WOMAN : Leave me alone.
MAN : I'm trying to find
out what's the matter with you
And find some way to help you.
WOMAN : The
only way you can
Help me is to leave me alone.
Can't you understand?
Isn't it plain enough?
I cannot bear to be handled.
MAN : By
anybody or just me?
WOMAN : I'm
through with men.
I didn't want to get married.
I kept waiting.
Anyway, I was doing all
right the way I was.
MARCIA : But
what about the baby?
JOHN : Oh, Marcia.
MARCIA : Oh, John.
JOHN : Oh, Marcia.
MARCIA : Oh, John.
JOHN : Oh, Marcia.
MARCIA : Oh, John.
JOHN : Marcia, Marcia.
MARCIA : John, John.
JOHN : Marcia, Marcia.
MARCIA : Oh,
John, John, John.
JOHN : Marcia.
MARCIA : John.
JOHN : Marcia.
MARCIA : John.
JOHN : Marcia.
Marcia.
MARCIA : John.
Oh, John.
JOHN : Oh, Marcia.
MARCIA : John.
John.
John.
John.
John.
John.
JOHN : Oh,
Marcia, Marcia.
MARCIA : Oh, John.
Oh, John.
JOHN : Oh, Marcia.
MARCIA : Oh, John.
Oh, John.
JOHN : Marcia.
MARCIA : John.
JOHN : Marcia.
MARCIA : John.
FRANKIE : Maggots.
And they're starting to hatch.
And as long as I'm bleeding, the
flies will be attracted to me
And lay their eggs.
They're hatching.
They're eating me alive!
I can't go home
empty-handed, not tonight.
Mike was right.
Sometimes you're
better off in jail.
Help!
Help!
Whoa.
Let's get him!
All right, that's enough.
Don't kill him yet.
Oh, yeah?
He didn't break your
fucking glasses.
I said that's enough!
Frankie.
Frankie, you shouldn't
resort to crime.
It's no way to solve
society's problems.
You know, since this
is stolen money,
I can't even put it
towards your debt.
That'll teach you to
be a fucking criminal.
Shit, man, what the
fuck was in that bag?
What are you talking about?
When it hit me, it felt
like a ton of bricks.
Well, there's
nothing in here now.
FRANKIE :
Right at that
Moment, I knew what
had to be done.
It was all coming back
to me, a revelation
That hit me like a bullet.
Bullets.
This shit was armed.
FRANKIE : I
felt a tremendous power
Surging through my veins.
Where's the gun?
FRANKIE :
I have now become God.
Holy shit.
It's not loaded, man.
It can't be.
We got the bullets.
Drop it or you're dead.
Frankie, look.
We'll make a deal, see?
I won't tell the cops
about the other guys, OK?
And you don't owe me any
money either, all right?
Here.
Here, take what I got, huh?
Come on.
Put it down.
Don't kill me.
No!
No!
Oh, god!
Goodbye, Paco.
FRANKIE : We
marched into the village
After three days of
intense fighting.
Our casualty rate was enormous.
We were expecting an
ambush, but everyone was
Dead in front of their huts.
They had killed themselves,
the women and children too.
Then we were ordered
to pump rounds of ammo
Into the dead bodies
to scare the VC.
And so we did.
M-16s, pistols, everything.
The whole fucking
squad just went crazy.
Bodies were butchered till
they looked like piles of meat.
My friends became animals.
They began to enjoy it.
I knew I had to get out,
or I'd become one of them.
So I started running.
They called me a deserter,
but what was I deserting?
I had never understood
what it was, what it meant.
But now it was so clear.
You see, they
wanted no part of us
And took their own
way out together.
Their wives wouldn't be
raped, nor the children
Tortured and mutilated.
They cheated us,
oh, yes, they did.
They were the survivors.
It was getting
clearer all the time.
The war is not over.
The battlefield
may have changed,
But the war is not over.
And you were right, Dad.
Your son died in Saigon.
But now I've got
to save my family.
WOMAN : Oh, my god!
Look at its face!
MAN : It's so ugly.
Hand me the cleaver!
WOMAN :
So now we're being thrown out.
What happened?
God, what were you, in a fight?
Did you get a job?
Did you call your father?
What did you do today?
And what's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Well, where have you been?
In the jungle.
You know, I think you're
really cracking up.
You are going crazy.
Where are we gonna live?
What are we gonna eat?
What are we gonna do?
My stomach hurts.
I can't take this anymore.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Damn you, shut up!
Why the hell don't
you do something?
All you do is sit by
and watch us suffer!
MAN :
What do you take me
for, Frankie, huh?
You think I'm one
of them out there.
You think you can tell me your
story, and I'll believe it.
Well, bullshit, motherfucker.
You're a fucking liar, Frankie.
The only massacre you saw
was the one you started.
You were the one who went
crazy, not your squad.
You flipped out and shot
everybody, even your own men.
MAN : He's firing!
I didn't give the
command to fire.
MAN : .
He's gone crazy.
He's just shot two men.
MAN : Dunlan!
Dunlan, cease fire!
MAN : Frankie!
MAN : Dunlan!
Drop it!
Dunlan, no!
MAN : Frankie!
Frankie, come back!
You're going the wrong way!
Cathy, I love you.
What?
Die!
Die, damn it!
It's not supposed
to be like this.
MAN: Open up in there.
This is the police.
I said open up in there.
This is the police.
There's something
blocking the door.
FRANKIE : I go back
there every night without fail.
