- Kolbein!
- Max!
Down! Down!
Speak Norwegian.
- We must get back.
- Cover me!
It happens often that I wake up
middle of the sounds from Finland.
I did so many times.
But not now.
They must lie still.
This time it's different.
They have suffered a decline.
They have a brain concussion.
The Russians were never longer
than 150 kilometer into Finland.
Norway, Germany had occupied
of two months.
I was embarrassed by atvære Norwegian.
- Gunnar.
- Hi.
- Kolbein, greet Gunnar.
- Sønsteby.
- Do we have contacted many?
- Yes, a few.
Small groups like ours
have emerged across the country.
People will not realize
the fight is over.
- Thank you for last.
- Hey, Tallak.
- Hi. Edvard Tallaksen.
- Max Manus. It is Kolbein Lauring.
- I celebrate anything?
- It's a wake.
- Max Manus.
- Gregers Gram.
- In Finland, was voluntary.
- I even went to Finland?
Was it exciting?
- No, it was useless.
- There is a cut defense.
- Then we even build an army.
- We are not enough and have no weapons.
- It's not what this is about.
- What then?
To send a message. Millions of
Norwegians think like us.
The war has only just begun.
We must show that the fight is not over.
We would like to fight.
We just waited at
that someone would engage in battle.
Someone has to go forward.
It is the brightest,
I have heard since 9 April.
Have you gone to university?
We just wanted to do something.
Somewhere.
Anything.
- What should we do with it?
- Fix a newspaper.
- Fix a newspaper?
- Yes. Propaganda.
The Germans had taken over all
newspapers and filled them with propaganda.
I walked out of fifth grade
and can barely write.
But we made a newspaper.
The first freedom in the country.
We fought for king and country.
We want ETLAND
Too NORWAY
We were careless.
I was imprudent.
Who are the Hovseter?
Greetings from Max Manus.
It is to Stein Forget Ming.
We were amateurs.
I thought not
of the consequences.
Swear to hell.
What is this some shit?
Perhaps the Minister may
send Whiskey from England.
I hear the king,
what he seems.
Close both eyes now, Tallak.
- There is nothing wrong with the sights.
- Scroll down mørklægningen.
Why do you want to travel,
when we have it so good here?
- That is where the resistance is organized.
- We organize it here.
Busting at the Colosseum Kino?
It is smart.
- Yes.
- It is not.
Imagine if taken fell on his head
of Quisling and Hilden Berg.
There are hundreds
country are traitors.
Are we lucky,
is head of the Gestapo there.
- Cash Gestapo commander?
- Yes.
Civilians would be shot as revenge.
You can not win the war by
making newspapers.
- We must do something active.
- It'll come.
- Django Reinhardt.
- Enjoy it while you can.
Do not know
Jazz has been banned?
Anything that is not ideologically correct.
Is Jens Book-Jenssen
as ideologically correct?
It is always wrong
to hear the tågehorn.
It is Saturday, guys. I would
have been out dancing with ...
... with a girl
I can not remember the name of.
- I could have been killed!
- Of a luftpistol?
- There is a courier who is waiting for me.
- I will miss you, Greg.
- Will you not be?
- Will you not?
I do not really now.
Have a good one.
He takes as a slut.
- Source him.
- No, no, no.
It is here.
Good catch.
Half a year into the war
everything was more organized.
We should obey orders.
One of those who had contact with
London was Jens Christian Hauge.
As children we played war
in Ljan forest.
Edvardsen.
- Detvar long ago now.
- What's your alias?
Tollef.
I thought you had to be lawyer
and counting money.
Are all come?
Edvard has spoken
with the government in London.
You decide. There will be no
actions without London's consent.
I have established a budrute to
Sweden and on to London.
Erling are the link in the network.
We are many, but most amateurs
so people need to England and train.
- I do not need training.
- Again, not me.
We are not
in a trench in Finland.
One should not
distribute leaflets openly.
Or download the arms of the people,
you do not know.
- Have you been in a fight?
- This is not about experience.
I know because,
how to keep a gun.
If the Gestapo get one
in your network, the flnder you.
If you proceed now,
you will be taken.
The government has asked me
assemble a ...
- See you tomorrow.
- It depends on the weather.
We want a country.
What kind of country, Max Manus?
I ...
I must to the toilet.
I have kept me all night.
Will I have, I will pee on the floor?
Can we be allowed to piss
in his own apartment?
I should have done
very different.
I would never have been
taken. Not now.
Not that way.
What kind of idiot who saves
explosives under the bed?
Conspiracy against the German State.
You will appear like to try
the newly introduced capital punishment.
Max, you should not!
Max, do not!
Max, drag you back!
Lig table.
To jump off was wise.
They are at Ullevål Hospital.
I have had a chance.
It will not I let go of me.
- How many?
- What do you think?
How many guards
there outside the door?
Five. They have weapons.
- What is your name?
- Liv.
- Where are you from?
- Eivindvik. In Sogn.
- There I've never been.
- It has only a few.
Are there many patriots there?
Can you smuggle a message out?
I think the doctor can. Maybe.
He is a danger to the kingdom
and be heard now.
If he moved, he dies.
It is absolutely excluded.
- He must at Victoria terasse now.
- No. He is the observation.
He has internal bleeding.
- This medicine has bought us some time.
- And Max?
Max by too much. Will he
led to Victoria terrace ...
He would rather that we should shoot him.
And Kolbein?
He released the death penalty.
It does not Max. He is worth it.
Bring a car.
KOLBEIN was successful
FOR GRINI. In NATKLOKKEN 4
Can you smoke it is outside?
Would you be comfortable?
Go now. I do myself.
No. Then he just left.
Hit me.
You have to beat me.
Otherwise they believe that I was with it.
So after he found you down, jumped
he is out the window and into a car?
- What about the girl?
- She was the accomplice.
Arrest her and the doctor, and send
a picture of him cowboys out.
He is probably in Sweden now,
if not he is in England.
Max Manus.
FOREST LODGE-training camps
SCOTLAND
Captain Linge?
- Who are you?
- Military officer Manus.
Manus? Was it you,
who jumped out the window?
Great spirit.
Bring a typewriter
that works.
Welcome to Scotland.
How was the trip?
- Long.
- Yes.
Volunteer in Finland.
Fought at Kongsvinger.
Service in London. And now you will enter
in Notwegian Independent Company?
Yes, if I may be allowed
to fight for my country.
If it can be done.
- What do you think?
- I flk done little late.
- There is no one has.
- They attack the Norwegian coast.
After the last attack
Germans shot 18 man.
They burned the city down and sent
Come.
Sit down. We have not won
a city, since we left of Narvik.
The Allies have been beaten back.
The Germans are ten kilometers
from Moscow. London is chopped bombed.
It is a matter of time
before we all have to learn German.
But us who are here,
we will fight no matter what.
Sit. The chance of survival
in my company is minimal.
All that is here is stupid
or not really clever.
If you are crazy or stupid
you're welcome.
So you're stupid?
Welcome. I look forward to
to work together with you, Manus.
Sign up with Corporal Gram.
He will show you around.
Without support from the people
we do not have a chance.
It is a big problem. If we do not
have people's confidence ...
One moment.
- Military officer.
- Corporal and instructor already?
Write 2000 words on the propaganda.
I heard on the drain. You were completely
by crawling down a window.
You do not help.
How hard can it be?
Give me a hand. Give me a hand.
- Have you heard from Kolbein?
- He sits in Grini.
He is the commander room.
He helped with a flight.
- If he does not even look like?
- He locked all the doors.
Since the last man was out,
locked again.
- Why?
- He flk bad conscience.
He felt his work was too
important that he could run away.
What a guy.
Come on! Come on!
You are not serious.
I will not be
to make newspapers.
Propaganda is more than just newspapers.
There is resistance in the population.
It creates national unity.
This causes us to burst
all German stock on Norwegian soil.
So. Now it sits there.
- Next time.
- And you are a teacher?
In propaganda, yes.
REJECTED
Should we not go?
- Why not?
- You must go.
- I will not.
- Crap.
- Have you spoken to Linge about this?
- I can not flnde him.
Is it too much to ask?
Yes?
- Colonel Sir? Military officer Manus.
- Yes. Window-source officer.
Close the door.
Sit down
and came straight to the point.
I hate excuses.
They lead to the requirement. Brandy?
- No thanks. I drink no more.
- Who does not drink during a war?
Thank you.
- Why was not our mission denied?
- I must go.
We expand the school. We would like
retain Corporal chart as a teacher.
But it is our mission.
We've planned it together,
me and Gregers.
- Captain Linge has ...
- Captain Linge was killed.
By Måløy.
Why would you be saboteur, Max?
My country was stolen from me.
And I want it back.
I admire your kampånd and Gram
will certainly annoy the Germans, --
- But he lacks experience
as a soldier.
I have more battle experience
than most of the company.
I look after him.
As members of the first Norwegian
The company has now trained --
- To carry out missions behind
enemy lines in your own country.
This is not infantry.
Forget everything I know about warfare.
The enemy is running together
with you in the bus.
It is the old lady who would have
the dusør, the Gestapo would udlove.
Keep concentration.
This requires more than just courage.
You are in close contact
with the Norwegian nature.
- What about containers?
- I found three of them.
- Four. Want a sip?
- Yes.
Thank you. Oslo harbor. 50 guards at night,
Why is there
Norwegian flag on?
- That we wait for.
- How long?
- TII we won the war.
- Are you ready?
Yes.
The three main objectives are Ortelsburg,
von Kniprode and Tuguela.
Sigurd our insider at Aker.
He puts limp on two other ships.
Tollef, I thought of
with retaliation.
The Germans do not
execute dockers.
That is why
we have English uniforms on.
- What if we were not being seen?
- We put some English effects.
- It should probably go.
- This is a limp mine.
It contains over one kg of plastic
explosives, and there are magnets on.
They must put on the side of ships.
It is our job.
You must keep us stable
into ships.
Using ac-delay and cortexlunter
mines will go eight hours later.
That is nine o'clock.
Questions?
This is the last chance.
If you want to drag you
so do it now.
Well.
OPERATION MARDONIUS
OSLO PORT 27 April 1943
Get the mongrel out of here.
It is night, beginning.
- We will be discovered.
- It's too late to turn back.
What the hell?
Have a nice day
Third-UBÅDS Company
- How are we going to Sweden?
- We paddle.
We are across the border
and take a train from Arvika.
Look!
Order directly
from Terboven.
He can no longer tolerate the
kind. He demands retaliation.
If it was British,
they have been helped by the port workers.
Detention five workers.
Get them to sing.
Are you new here?
My name is Siegfried.
- Solveig.
- What a pretty, Norwegian name.
Say, if I can help
with anything. I do not bite.
I would just do my work.
It makes you probably a good thing.
And remember. Ask for ...
- Sigfried.
- Right.
We must be in Sweden now.
Can you not feel that nature
has become more Swedish?
- Where are we going?
- When it is not. The orders Tlkken.
- Did not I tell you about her?
- Is it a new Swedish girl?
No, she is Norwegian.
She is just our boss.
All right. She is ugly.
No, she's not ugly. We have just
more of a brother-sister relationship.
- Should I try next?
- No.
- So you want her?
- No.
That, my friend, this is Sweden.
DETBRITISKE CONSULAR
I see if I can flnde Tlkken.
Sorry.
Good morning.
I need equipment.
- Who are you?
- Mr busy.
We need two diving suits,
- Write down now.
- Let me look at it here.
and 15 bottles of whiskey?
Can you get it or not?
I do not have time to discuss.
Do not stress out.
I have 20 refugees here.
I have 300 boxes of tobacco,
to be distributed among all.
Ask yourself in a queue like any other
and bring it there.
Now, do not wear yourself up.
- Greg. Hello.
- You see, as always good.
Can we borrow you for a moment;
Max and I?
Max Manus, who fled
from Ullevål? Is he here?
- Is it?
- Max, welcome Tlkken.
Is it Tlkken?
What is Tlkken for?
Ida Nikoline Lie
Lind break Bernades.
It was a long name.
It was cold and dark
and his paddle distracting me.
Suddenly he was just, and I
felt hot, German urine over me.
- It is not true.
- And he gave me a hug afterwards.
- It was certainly deserved.
- Apropos of urine.
Are you ready soon?
- With what?
- As to behave so?
You do not always go
after first appearance.
It usually is a good fit.
So you are therefore a self-goose?
Have I learned to know each other?
It's been a long day.
- Greg.
- Tlkken.
- We talk to you.
- What are you doing?
FOREST LODGE
SCOTLAND 7 June 1943
Corporal Gregers Gram.
Military officer Max Manus.
- I will never forget you.
- They are an inspiration to us all.
It is probably the opposite, military officer Manus.
Yesterday a difficult time in the meeting.
I do not doubt your courage.
I would just ask you not
underestimating the enemy --
- In the same way
he underestimated us.
I ask you to convey my thanks
from me --
- To all those
who could not be here.
The work you do for Norway,
is crucial and historically.
Just to see you here today fills
a king with an enormous pride.
God be with you all.
I was too far from him.
- So it stupidly like?
- No, no.
- He knew my name.
- The captain said the course.
- Have you heard anything?
- We travel about two days.
- And we get more equipment this time.
- Yes, now you know the king.
- Mr Fehmer.
- Sorry.
Mrs Jacobsen would like to speak with you.
Sid finally down.
What can I do for you?
Her son Sigurd Jacobsen
was arrested at the port.
Sigurd is a good boy.
He had nothing to do with it.
His uncle has been
member of the TS for many years.
I wonder also
entering the lot.
They do not join you in
to convince me.
He is the only one I have.
I will investigate.
Should I pull the order back?
Beware.
Add an.
Shoot!
How the hell
flk they get Sigurd?
- It was not your fault, Max.
- He died for the case.
For the case?
See there. They both, we lowered,
was minor compared to.
They carry prisoners, soldiers
and arms every day.
- How can we beat it?
- They make mistakes. We must not.
No, because we are
so professional, right?
It is not a game, this.
What if the flk get your name?
They did not.
That is why he is dead
and I live.
Solveig, I look like a Norwegian now?
- I will stop after this week.
- What is it for something, my dear?
- Why you lied to the lady?
- What do you think?
You must understand that it is not easy
to be in my position.
The desperate acts of terrorism
serves no purpose.
They bring civilian lives in danger,
if they are not stopped.
Sometimes, we must take
difficult choices to everyone's best interests.
What would you have done?
I would live in peace.
Will you?
I am here because I love Norway.
I would build a future here.
The resistance is over, when people
understand that we want their best.
Would you shoot me now?
Kolbein?
You are still just imprudent.
- When you slack off?
- Right now.
Three years of hell.
How did you like?
The Germans were well out of that I do not
had anything to do with you.
- Want a great cup of coffee?
- Yes.
Can we drink it outside?
I've had enough of small, dark room.
- What would you now?
- Avenge me.
You've been out in two seconds
and you will enter to sit again.
You can then enjoy the freedom a little.
You can not round a corner,
without any control.
Mr Bugge. Mr Brown.
Have a nice day.
Mr Blue.
- He said what he wanted?
- Only that we should meet here.
Jens Christian looks serious.
- What was with him?
- Have not heard it?
Quislings new labor service.
He will not get anywhere with it.
Only the unemployed arise.
- He introduces it as a service.
- That he can not.
It goes poorly østfronten, so he
will send Norwegian boys there.
- All between 18 and 20
- How many?
calls out tomorrow.
Anyone who does not turn up,
being arrested. Damn.
Who was it? Gestapo?
- Gunnar, who is it?
- My mother.
- Your mother?
- She believes I am in Sweden.
She gets a nervesammenbrud,
if she sees me.
They have all files with names
various locations in the city.
We take the registry of the Police
Kjelland and the Labor Service.
Go ahead. Have a nice day.
Out with you!
Come out with you!
Fast! Out!
Fast!
- What a time it took.
- Talk nicely.
- Who is it?
- It's Karl-Johan.
I have an important message
to major Kjelland.
- Are you alone here?
- Where is the archive?
There are a lot.
Sit here.
We make you nothing.
Should we blow it?
- No, we burn it in the fireplace.
- There is no time for.
Dick ring out
if there are any.
Listen here. People sleep around
in the apartment here.
It will take all night.
- Are you ready soon?
- How goes it with her?
She has not so good.
- Dick, how many?
- No clue. It is the police.
Germans are just around the corner.
Per the road. Lars-Emil, you
with me. In others, the road.
Run!
There.
Held!
Held! Get off!
Up with your hands!
Hands up.
Turn around.
Keep your hands up.
Higher.
Come closer. Slowly.
Lars-Emil!
Lars-Emil. Lars-Emil!
You were lucky.
It'll grow together.
- Who is here?
- Max and Kolbein.
- Where is Lars-Emil?
- He did it, unfortunately not.
- And Dick and Tlmo?
- I think they are doing.
We should have blown
it all into pieces.
- As with Per?
- No, unfortunately.
They had 50 men available.
We shot him in the neck.
We will flnde him.
Why should I work with
such incapable fools?
I had him surrounded,
and yet I let him go.
Now you too far.
It is completely unacceptable.
They keep you from my area.
- Is that clear?
- Yes. That is understood.
How beflnder Max Manus themselves?
Get him away.
We will continue this evening.
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.
I've packed your things.
We travel about an hour.
THREE TERRORISTS shot
Everything has two sides.
The winner determines
who is a terrorist or patriot.
Should we do the propaganda?
It is an enormous risk.
It is a necessary risk.
- I do not want, something happens.
- Is it wrong, then wept a little for me.
Then you must make sure that my statue
get a flattering place.
Go ahead. A little summer gift
from us two for you.
From Scotland.
Open now.
- What have you two been on?
- Wait and see.
It is
the English royal family's hunting cabin.
We thought it was
an ordinary house, we broke into i.
- So it was filled with rococo furniture.
- Have you no manners?
- Ask the Conservative politician.
- I keep you away from my son.
- Do you have a son?
- Yes. George. He is five years.
World flneste little boy.
Where is he now?
He is at boarding school outside the city.
It is safer there.
It looks harmless out
but it can trigger a disaster.
Maximo Manus.
He fled from us three years ago.
We have tried to inflltrere those
but they are very careful.
He is cautious but ambitious.
- He is lucky to have you.
- Yes.
Once he fell asleep in the tram
and then came the Gestapo.
He had his pocket full
of illegal leaflets.
But they nænnede not to awaken him.
He looked so peaceful out.
Poor thing.
Sometimes I almost yearn
back to Finland.
Why?
It could see the enemy in the eye.
It was us or them.
Now the enemy is behind you
and around you. Everywhere.
They torture and kill my friends
to get me.
- Some have to lead.
- Yes.
I led them into something
they can not get out of.
- You laugh?
- Sorry.
I open myself, and then you laugh.
I knew just did not,
you were so sentimental.
Is there something wrong with that?
It becomes us men when we drink.
Gregers said that you cried,
when you saw Gone with the wind.
- And I regard him as a brother.
- I thought it was for fun.
- What you thought when you heard that?
- It should not be ashamed.
- I am not. Are you?
- No. Should it be embarrassing to me?
That I do not know. To sit and drink
fill jars with two all night.
- What is your man for this?
- He is in England.
We are still married --
- But we are not
really married longer if you understand.
All right.
- What are you now?
- Remove the foot from spinach.
- You have a bad sense of humor.
- You laugh then.
Hitler, Goebbels
and Hitler entering a bar.
- Hitler and Hitler?
- Himmler.
- Quiet.
- What is it?
- It's sabotage.
- No.
What is it?
Quiet.
Space is guaranteed.
- Is this safe?
- Yes.
Who taught you to dance?
- A happy girl in Havana.
- Exactly.
I was 14 years old.
- Have you been to Havana?
- Yes.
Fut-fut.
My father sent me to Cuba
to become a man.
The mission has failed.
- Whiskey?
- Yes.
Moved you from your family,
when you were 14?
No.
It is a long history.
- Now we see if you can dance.
- No, no, no.
All right.
Come here.
I just need
to support me to you.
I have to go.
That you do not.
See you.
MRS ØYNEBRÅTENS OPPORTUNITY
FRICHSGADE 2 OSLO
Is there not a rooster?
It is hidden, so you can shoot
from your pocket without it stuck.
The front girl.
Can I see?
Is there a dusør?
- Olav must be involved.
- We do not need more people.
- What we have then.
- Hi. Olav.
I think so. Take care, Max.
Half the group was taken.
- Take your precautions.
- I stick to the boys here.
Will I need me, so please ask for a
Turkish among kringle baker Andersen.
What if we get a kringle?
- Turkish kringle flndes not.
- I have tasted one.
- No, it was the Turkish pastry.
- Forget the kringle.
Watch out, Max. You can not jump out
through the windows anymore.
- What happened?
- He lost the gun.
- Call an ambulance.
- He is wanted.
- My father is a doctor.
- To get him, however!
Sorry.
- Damn, Greg. Tallak.
- Be quiet.
My brothers ... our king.
He was also hit in the leg.
Two locations.
It went through my leg first.
- I can see the ball.
- Can you?
It's just a small splinter.
Where was I scared.
It makes damn evil.
There were some pieces I did not
could get out. Do the hospital.
- I can not.
- Then you must come to Sweden.
- There may be inflammation in it.
- I can not let boys.
What I also know about it?
I have only been a doctor in 30 years.
Does he have more dressings
or pills?
- I can not leave now.
- You do not benefit without your legs.
Want to contribute to Sweden?
One of us must stay here.
And be careful,
that gutterne not burst palace.
- It's a bad time.
- You will soon be back.
See here. So you do not forget
what we need.
What an idiot I am.
You know what?
You are absolutely right.
Stop!
Are you sure of this?
It is the Germans.
They must have realized
which way the war goes.
- You do not agree.
- Yes, I would like.
- Then came you.
- This is one of my friends.
Take a seat. I ordered coffee.
Replacement Coffee.
- Will you please sit there?
- Yes.
I am pleased
that you have contacted us.
It means a lot to us to get
information about the Gestapo.
But I have to make sure
you are really on our side.
It is ...
It is a dangerous ...
... game.
Quiet, quiet. Shoot no.
Gregers!
Stop!
He is still alive.
Such. Now you must take it
amble a few days.
Sorry.
Hello.
- Gunnar? They have not taken Kolbein?
- No.
Gregers?
It can not match.
That is not to hell.
- When flk you know?
- In the morning.
It can not match.
We can not, Tlkken.
How?
It was at Plasskafeen.
An ambush.
I knew
I should not be taken away.
- You can not take you ...
- Were there others?
- Tallak. He was arrested.
- When does the train to Arvika?
You can not leave.
So they caught you.
- You can not save everyone, Max.
- I can save him.
How can you travel now?
You can be comfortable here.
Here. You may not travel far.
How can you
asking me to be?
No. No.
I do not know who I think I am.
I am just a messenger.
I know nothing.
Do not make it difficult
for yourself now, Tallaksen.
Can you put any other music?
You can take it quite calmly.
We have a good time.
Torture is a symphony in several rates.
This is just the first.
You can die quickly and painlessly --
- When you have told us everything.

We will both die.
I can die with a smile,
I know we will win.
Gregers knew it. Tallak smiled,
when he knappede his shirt up.
He knew we would win
with or without him.
Just as we know that ...
I have to.

Hello?
Is here anyone?

How long have you been here?
Gunnar has not seen you for days.

- I celebrate.
There is simply no
to celebrate with.
I am not
your responsibility longer Tlkken.
That is not how it works.
See it there.
I thought it was God.
I asked him --
- Why he
Gregers trains instead of me.
Is that so much to ask?
There's nothing more pathetic than
a soldier who no longer need.
A drunkard ... with bad nerves.
Max, which is peace.
You do not save you more.
They are dead, Tlkken!
They are dead, everybody!
- And for what?
- They are not all dead.

education and no work!
I do not have you.
All my life was planned.
I am married to a diplomat.
Fine apartment in Stockholm.
Just as
my parents would --
- And now I sit here with you.

- You drink and feel sorry for yourself.
And yet ... I have never met
a man like you, Max.
