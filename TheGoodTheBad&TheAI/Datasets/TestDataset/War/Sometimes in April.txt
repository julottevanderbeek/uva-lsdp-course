WHEN DID IT ALL BEGIN?
IT IS SAID, "WHEN IMANA
CREATED THIS LAND,
HE GREW SO FOND OF IT, HE
RETURNED EVERY NIGHT TO REST.
WHEN DID PARADISE
BECOME HELL?
FROM THE START,
EVEN THE CONQUEST
WAS A REGRETTABLE
MISUNDERSTANDING.
EUROPE GAVE THE LAND
TO ITS CONQUEROR,
AND THE KING KNEW
NOTHING OF IT.
IT WAS NEVER ABOUT
CIVILIZATION,
NEVER ABOUT TRIBE
OR RACE.
IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT
GREED,
ARROGANCE AND POWER.
AND WHEN WE FINALLY
GRASPED THE HORROR,
IT WAS TOO LATE.
From Kibuye in the west
to Kibungo in the east,
people gathered
seeking refuge
in churches
by the thousands,
in hospitals and schools.
And when they were found,
the old and the sick,
women and children alike,
they were killed.
Killed because their identity
card said they were Tutsi.
Or because they had
a Tutsi parent.
Or because someone thought
they looked like a Tutsi.
Or slain like
thousands of Hutus
because they
protected Tutsis
or would not
countenance a policy
that sought
to wipe out people
who just the day before,
and for years before, had been
their friends and neighbors.
It is important
that the world know
that these killings were not
spontaneous or accidental.
It is not an
African phenomenon
and must never
be viewed as such.
We have seen it
in industrialized Europe.
We have seen it in Asia.
We must have
global vigilance
and never again
must we be shy
in the face
of the evidence.
OKAY, I'M SURE SOME OF YOU
HAVE QUESTIONS.
YES, VENANCIA?
MR. AUGUSTIN, WEREN'T YOU IN
THE ARMY BEFORE THE GENOCIDE?
COULD IT HAVE BEEN STOPPED,
ALL THE DYING?
THAT'S THE PAST. THOSE
BAD THINGS ARE IN THE PAST.
MAYBE IF SOME
OF US WERE MORE COURAGEOUS.
MAYBE IF THE WORLD
HAD PAID MORE ATTENTION.
I DON'T KNOW.
YES, ALBERT?
WHAT KIND OF SOLDIER
WERE YOU?
A VERY BAD ONE.
I'M SORRY, VENANCIA.
I DIDN'T ANSWER
YOUR QUESTION.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
WE COULD HAVE DONE.
OKAY.
YES, IT'S APRIL AGAIN.
EVERY YEAR IN APRIL
THE RAINY SEASON STARTS.
AND EVERY YEAR,
EVERY DAY IN APRIL,
A HAUNTING EMPTINESS
DESCENDS OVER OUR HEARTS.
EVERY YEAR IN APRIL
I REMEMBER HOW
QUICKLY LIFE ENDS.
EVERY YEAR
I REMEMBER HOW LUCKY
I SHOULD FEEL
TO BE ALIVE.
EVERY YEAR IN APRIL,
I REMEMBER.
"MY DEAR BROTHER,
THE RAINS ARE HERE.
IT IS APRIL AGAIN.
HOW MANY YEARS
SINCE WE HAVE SPOKEN?
FROM MY PRISON, I AM WRITING
YOU THIS LONG DUE LETTER.
I DON'T EXPECT
PITY OR LOVE.
I KNOW THAT DESPITE ALL
THE GRIEF IN YOUR LIFE,
YOU HAVE FOUND
SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR.
IT WAS NOT SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN THIS WAY...
THE WAR,
THE KILLINGS.
WHEN I FINALLY REALIZED THAT
I WAS AN ACTOR IN THIS TRAGEDY,
I CHOSE NOT
TO LIVE WITH THAT.
I THOUGHT MY DEATH
WOULD BRING ME PEACE.
I WAS WRONG.
ONLY THE TRUTH
CAN EASE MY GUILT.
DEAR AUGUSTIN,
I MUST TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED
TO JEANNE AND THE CHILDREN.
COME TO TANZANIA.
DON'T WRITE ME BACK.
JUST COME.
YOUR BROTHER,
HONORE."
AUGUSTIN,
YOU SHOULD GO.
NO.
IT'S OVER.
WHAT'S THE POINT?
- HE'S YOUR BROTHER.
- HE'S NOTHING TO ME.
I JUST WANT TO TAKE
CARE OF YOU.
- OH, REALLY?
- YES.
SO, WHERE IS MY
WEDDING RING?
OH!
SO THAT'S IT, HUH?
I SEE YOU
STILL HAVE YOURS.
YOU KNOW I CAN'T.
JEANNE IS...
WHAT?
STOP.
YOU STILL CAN'T
SAY IT, CAN YOU?
YOU MUST GO.
NOT JUST FOR HONORE,
BUT FOR YOU.
MR. BUTERA, YOU WERE ARRESTED
IN MAY, 1997 FOR THE CRIME
OF INCITING VIOLENCE
WITH YOUR RADIO PROGRAM.
AT THE TIME, YOU ENTERED
A NOT-GUILTY PLEA.
TODAY YOU WISH
TO CHANGE THAT PLEA?
YES.
I NOW RECOGNIZE
THAT THE RADIO PROGRAMS
I DID FOR RTLM
WERE CRIMINAL
AND THAT MANY PEOPLE
WERE KILLED FOR IT.
YOU WERE NOT AWARE OF WHAT
YOU WERE DOING IN APRIL, 1994?
NO, NOT AT THAT TIME.
COULD YOU
EXPLAIN TO THIS TRIBUNAL
THE REASON
FOR YOUR TURNABOUT?
I HAVE HAD A LOT OF TIME
TO THINK ABOUT MY GUILT
HERE IN PRISON
SURROUNDED
BY OTHER RWANDANS
ACCUSED
OF THE SAME CRIME.
I WAS UNDER
A LOT OF PRESSURE.
PRESSURE FROM YOUR
CO-DETAINEES?
YES. PRESSURE
TO KEEP SILENT.
COULD YOU IDENTIFY
THESE INDIVIDUALS FOR US?
I PREFER NOT TO.
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT ANYMORE.
WHAT I WANT TO SAY
IS THAT IT TOOK TIME
FOR ME TO REALIZE THAT WHAT
I HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF
MAY HAVE BEEN TRUE AND THAT
WHAT I HAVE PARTICIPATED IN
WAS GENOCIDE.
SO YOU CAME TO ACCEPT
THE FACT OF YOUR GUILT?
YES, I BECAME AWARE
I WAS GUILTY.
BUT IT TOOK YOU TWO YEARS
TO FINALLY ADMIT THIS GUILT.
- IS THIS CORRECT?
- YES,
THAT IS CORRECT.
WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE
SURE THAT...
WE WILL STOP NOW
AND RESUME AT 9:30 A.M.
ON MONDAY MORNING.
I REMIND THE DEFENDANT
THAT HE IS UNDER
A SOLEMN OATH OF SILENCE.
DO NOT DISCUSS YOUR
EVIDENCE WITH ANYONE.
- I WANT TO RETURN
BEFORE WE GO ON...
KIGALI, ARE YOU IN THE HOUSE?
COME ON,
LET ME HEAR IT!
AND NOW, OUR STAR
SPEAKER IS HERE.
COMING TO YOU LIVE
IS MR. HONORE BUTERA,
HERE TO GIVE US ANOTHER OF
HIS POPULAR HISTORICAL REVIEWS.
EXCLUSIVELY FOR
RADIO MILLE COLLINES.
BEFORE I PASS THE MIC
PEOPLE, REMEMBER,
- A COCKROACH CANNOT GIVE BIRTH...
- HEY.
TO A BUTTERFLY.
A COCKROACH WILL ALWAYS GIVE
BIRTH TO COCKROACHES 162Habyarimana
BE VIGILANT.
THEY'RE AMONG US,
THOSE INYENZI.
THE DEVILS.
OYE, OYE.
YEGO, YEGO, YEGO.
AS ALWAYS,
SPEAKING THE TRUTH.
OYE, OYE, OYE.
NOW, MY DEAR LISTENERS...
YESTERDAY, WE SPOKE
ABOUT HOW THE BAZUNGU,
THE GERMAN AND BELGIAN
COLONISTS,
CHOSE THE TUTSI INVADERS AS
PROXIES FOR THEIR DIRTY JOBS.
FORCED LABOR,
RAISING OF HEAVY TAXES
ON THOSE POOR PEASANTS
AND THE WHIPPING.
We Hutu, will we ever
forget the whipping?
Will we,
my dear listeners?
I think not, for these
scars will never heal.
But the days when
a Tutsi King Umwami
is imposed upon
Hutus is passed.
For we have sworn never to
let them rule over us again.
- Never.
Stay tuned,
my dear listeners
for some more music
from Radio Sympa,
Power 106FM,
RTLM, Kigali.
HEY, NOT LIKE THAT.
CIVIL FORCES
MY FOOT, EH?
IF THE R.P.F. COME
FROM THE HILLS,
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL
THESE GUYS. HEY!
I DON'T BELIEVE
WE ARE TRAINING
THESE INTERAHAMWE
TO FIGHT REBELS.
I HAVE HEARD RUMORS.
THERE ARE ASSASSINATIONS,
SMALL MASSACRES HERE
AND THERE IN THE PROVINCES.
THINGS ARE ACCELERATING.
THAT'S ALL THEY ARE...
RUMORS.
YOU THINK THIS IS A REHEARSAL?
THESE OFFICIALS ARE HERE
FOR THE DAMNED SHOW, MAN.
HEY, NOT WITH A MACHETE!
GIVE ME THIS.
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY,
CAPTAIN.
VALIANT MEMBERS
OF THE CIVIL DEFENSE FORCE,
GIVE ME YOUR WEAPONS.
SOLDIER!
CAPTAIN MUGANZA,
GIVE THESE
TO THE CHIEF FOR ME.
- WHICH CHIEF?
- COLONEL BAGOSORA.
- WHAT IS IT?
- LISTS.
THESE ARE EXECUTION LISTS.
IT'S NAMES AND ADDRESSES.
TRAITORS.
THAT'S WHAT HE CALLED THEM.
THERE ARE LISTS COMING
FROM ALL DISTRICTS.
IT'S TUTSIS.
BUT IT'S ALSO HUTUS.
THERE ARE DOCTORS
ON THAT LIST,
PROFESSORS
ON THAT LIST.
ANYBODY THAT MIGHT
NOT BOW DOWN
TO HUTU POWER
IS ON THAT LIST!
TEACHERS, TEACHERS
ARE REGISTERING
THEIR STUDENTS
BY ETHNICITY.
WHAT ARE YOU
TWO PLOTTING?
NOTHING. XAVIER
WAS JUST LEAVING.
COME ON, HAVE
A BEER WITH US.
- THE SOCCER MATCH IS ON.
- I CAN'T.
I HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT.
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.
BYE, JEANNE.
- PLEASE TELL FELICIE TO COME TO VISIT US. SIBYO?
- YEAH.
AUGUSTIN, WHAT'S
GOING ON?
MOM.
HELLO.
- MOM!
- HMM?
YVES-ANDRE WAS SAYING
BAD WORDS AGAIN.
IT'S NOT TRUE, MOM, I SWEAR.
I WAS JUST TELLING HIM A JOKE.
HE'S LYING.
HE SAID FUCK.
MARCUS, PLEASE.
I HEAR THAT ALL DAY.
IT'S HAPPENING,
ISN'T IT?
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T
HAVE LISTENED TO YOU.
WE SHOULD HAVE GONE A LONG
TIME AGO TO KENYA OR SENEGAL.
I DON'T KNOW, BUT...
I'M IN THE MILITARY.
THIS IS OUR HOME.
SURE, BUT TELL ME
HOW CAN I CALL
THIS HOME
WHEN I'M LIVING IN
CONSTANT FEAR, AUGUSTIN?
I LOST ALREADY MOST
OF MY FAMILY IN '92.
- IT'S ONLY US NOW.
- I CAN'T JUST GET UP AND RUN!
- ABANDON EVERYTHING, WHAT? - WE SHOULD
HAVE BROUGHT ANNE-MARIE BACK SOONER.
ANNE-MARIE IS SAFER IN
THE COUNTRYSIDE THAN HERE.
COME ON, WAKE UP!
NOBODY'S SAFE
IN THIS COUNTRY.
YOU HAVE SEEN THE BAHUTU
TEN COMMANDMENTS?
SOMEBODY PUT IT
ON MY DESK
TODAY AT THE HOSPITAL.
THEY EVEN UNDERLINED
NUMBER SEVEN.
"THE RWANDESE ARMED FORCES
SHOULD BE EXCLUSIVELY HUTU.
NO MEMBER OF MILITARY
SHALL MARRY A TUTSI."
JEANNE.
JEANNE.
NOW I'M TALKING ABOUT
OUR CHILDREN'S LIVES.
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS,
THEY WILL LET US ALL DIE.
OKAY, JEANNE.
JUST LET ME FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.
FOR NOW, WHY DON'T YOU CALL
ANNE-MARIE AND TELL HER TO GET READY?
- UNCLE!
- HEY, MARCUS!
THIS IS YOUR BROTHER. I'M SORRY.
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR IT TODAY.
AUGUSTIN, IT'S A SMALL
COUNTRY AND PEOPLE TALK.
SO NOW YOU THINK I
HAVE JOINED THE REBELS?
OF COURSE NOT. BUT YOU MUST
HAVE SAID OR DONE SOMETHING.
I AM DOING WHAT
I HAVE ALWAYS DONE.
THAT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH. YOU
NEED TO BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE.
AND WHAT SIDE IS THAT?!
HSST!
"HUTU POWER OVER ALL"?
YOUR PEOPLE WILL DRAG
THIS COUNTRY OVER THE EDGE.
SO YOU THINK THE ARUSHA AGREEMENTS
WILL SOLVE ALL OUR PROBLEMS.
- IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
- IF THE ARUSHA AGREEMENTS GO INTO EFFECT
I WILL PROBABLY LOSE MY JOB TO A
TUTSI. SO EITHER WAY I AM SCREWED.
THAT IS WHY WE ARE
AGAINST THE AGREEMENT.
SO THAT HARD-WORKING
HUTUS LIKE YOURSELF
DO NOT HAVE TO STAND
ASIDE FOR ANYBODY.
NO, FOR YOU IT'S ABOUT
POWER! GAINING POWER.
AUGUSTIN,
THE AGREEMENTS ARE DEAD.
THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE TOO MANY
CONCESSIONS UNDER FOREIGN PRESSURE.
IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO KNOW, MY DEAR BROTHER,
- THIS IS A FATAL MISTAKE.
- HONORE...
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT A COUP?
AUGUSTIN, THIS IS WAR.
LISTEN, LITTLE BROTHER.
EVEN WARS HAVE RULES.
WE CANNOT JUSTIFY THE
SLAUGHTERING OF INNOCENT PEOPLE.
YOUR EXTREMIST FRIENDS WILL
DRAG THIS COUNTRY INTO HELL.
THANKS TO THE SUPPORT
OF OUR FRENCH FRIENDS,
WE HAVE KALASHNIKOVS
FROM ALBANIA,
ISRAEL UZIS,
CZECH GRENADES,
M-16 RIFLES
FROM THE U.S.A.,
GUNS AND AMMO
FROM EGYPT.
CAPTAIN MUGANZA,
GIVE ME A HAND, PLEASE.
- MACHETES?
- MACHETES, CAPTAIN.
FROM CHINA.
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?
- IT'S NOT ON OUR MANIFEST.
- SO WHAT?
THEY'RE HERE AND WE HAVE
PLENTY OF FARMERS OUT THERE
WHO NEED TO GO TO WORK.
OUR PEOPLE NEED
TO GO TO WORK.
CAPTAIN...
MON COLONEL.
OUR PRESIDENT HAS BECOME SOFT
PLAYING THE GAME
OF THE INYENZI!
THE AGREEMENTS
WILL BE OUR DEATH!
THEY CALL US HUTU POWER,
EXTREMISTS
BECAUSE WE WON'T
ACCEPT THEIR DICTATES?
SO BE IT!
POWER!
Tension is mounting
in Rwanda despite the presence...
There are
signs that the ceasefire
between the existing Hutu
government of Rwanda
and the mostly
Tutsi rebel forces
of the Rwandan Patriotic Front,
or R.P.F., is about to fail.
Special envoy,
Assistant Secretary of State
Prudence Bushnell, traveled
to Rwanda two weeks ago
in a last effort to bring
President Habyarimana
to implement the agreements.
an agreement they say,
gives too much power
to the Tutsis and the R.P.F.
This may also well be
the last chance for peace.
AND SO...
BEDTIME.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON,
BOYS, LIGHTS OUT.
MOM?
WHY DO THEY CALL
US COCKROACHES?
'CAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW
ANY BETTER, SWEETHEART.
DAD, WHAT ARE WE?
- HUTU OR TUTSI?
- DON'T YOU KNOW ANYTHING?
PAPA'S A HUTU.
MOM'S A TUTSI.
IT'S OKAY, YVES-ANDRE.
HE CAN ASK.
I AM A HUTU,
SO YOU ARE A HUTU.
IN OUR TRADITION,
THE FATHER'S ORIGIN DECIDES.
SO WHEN I GROW UP,
MY I.D. CARD
WILL SAY HUTU?
YES, BUT ONE DAY,
I HOPE IT WILL JUST
SAY RWANDAN.
OKAY, BEDTIME.
- GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.
SWEET DREAMS.
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.
AUGUSTIN.
THEY'VE JUST ANNOUNCED THAT THE
PRESIDENT'S PLANE WAS SHOT DOWN.
PACK A FEW THINGS
FOR THE KIDS.
WE HAVE TO LEAVE
KIGALI TONIGHT.
We ask all
Rwandese people
not to sucmb to this
terrible tragedy.
We ask the armed forces
to stay vigilant
- and ensure
security for all.
AUGUSTIN,
I CAN'T GET ANNE-MARIE
ON THE PHONE.
KEEP TRYING.
- WHO'S THERE?
- IT'S ME, XAVIER.
AUGUSTIN,
IT'S TERRIBLE.
THEY'RE SHOOTING EVERYBODY.
THERE'S DEAD PEOPLE IN THE STREET.
- FELICIE AND I WERE
PICKING UP SOME FOOD
FROM LANDO'S RESTAURANT
WHEN WE HEARD THE EXPLOSION.
THEY ARE GOING HOUSE BY HOUSE
PULLING PEOPLE OUT.
- AUGUSTIN, LET'S GO.
- NO. THERE ARE ROADBLOCKS ALL OVER.
- WE LEAVE, WE WALK INTO THE MOUTH OF THE LION.
- WHERE DO YOU THINK WE ARE?
WE CAN'T GET TRAPPED
IN KIGALI!
AT LEAST THE U.N.
IS HERE. MAYBE...
- WE'RE SITTING IN THE MIDDLE.
- OKAY, GO! GO.
MR. VILBUR,
MY WIFE AND CHILDREN
WOULD FEEL SO MUCH SAFER
IN YOUR HOUSE.
I WOULD BE RISKING THE
LIVES OF MY OWN FAMILY.
- I MUST ASK YOU TO LEAVE.
- MR. VILBUR, PLEASE.
JUST ONE NIGHT.
NO.
AT LEAST...
AT LEAST TAKE THE WOMEN
AND THE CHILDREN.
JUST THE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN.
ONE NIGHT.
THIS IS ALL YOU HAVE?
HELLO?
YES, YOU MUST HELP ME.
IT'S THE FIFTH TIME
I'VE CALLED.
I MUST REACH ANNE-MARIE.
YES, I'M HER FATHER.
THEN CAN I SPEAK
TO THE HEAD PRIEST?
Sorry, I can't help you.
THEY HUNG UP.
Kurt Cobain's body was
found inside a garage apartment
adjacent to his
Seattle home,
dead of an apparently
self-inflicted shotgun wound.
...gave back to
back homeruns in the 6th inning
to turn a one-run deficit
into a one-run lead.
...Wednesday's sharp gains.
Dow Jones Industrial
average closed up...
- LIONEL, THANKS FOR COMING. I'M SORRY.
- SURE.
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING THROUGH YOUR
CHANNELS? OUR INTEL IS PRACTICALLY NIL.
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
EITHER. IT'S NIGHT OVER THERE,
SO NO ONE KNOWS WHAT'S
REALLY GOING ON.
ALL WE KNOW FOR SURE IS
THAT A PLANE WAS SHOT DOWN
AND THE PRESIDENT
OF RWANDA IS DEAD.
SO IS THE PRESIDENT OF BURUNDI
WHO WAS ALONG FOR THE RIDE.
WHAT'S YOUR BEST GUESS AS TO
WHO SHOT THE PLANE DOWN?
COULD BE ANYBODY, REALLY. REBELS,
HUTU EXTREMISTS, FRENCH MERCENARIES.
BUT THE PRESIDENTIAL GUARD WON'T
LET ANYBODY NEAR THE CRASH SITE.
WELL, THEY'RE PROBABLY
THE ONES WHO SHOT IT.
This is NBC Nightly News
reported by Brian Williams.
Good evening. Fighting
is going on tonight
in the small African
nation of Rwanda,
and there
is growing concern
about getting the Americans and
other foreigners there out...
Killings and looting
have been reported
following a suspicious
plane crash...
...government ministers opposed to
the late president have been kidnapped.
...that both the United Nations and
the press keep well away from their war.
Which leaves the U.N.
in an impossible position.
WE ARE TAKING OVER
THE PRIME MINISTER'S SECURITY.
- FIVE MEN DOWN!
- WE WILL ESCORT YOU BACK TO U.N. HEADQUARTERS.
OUT OF THE QUESTION. I NEED TO
TALK TO THE COMMANDING OFFICER.
I AM THE COMMANDING OFFICER! PUT
DOWN YOUR GUNS OR WE FINISH YOU.
WE'VE GOT FIVE MEN DOWN.
I REPEAT, FIVE MEN DOWN.
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE US.
WE NEED REINFORCEMENTS NOW!
AM I CLEAR ENOUGH?
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND?
WE'RE GONNA BE LYNCHED!
OVER!
WE KNOW THE PRIME MINISTER
IS HERE!
HERE I AM.
COME WITH US, MADAME.
TAKE ME TO YOUR
COMMANDING OFFICER.
BUT PLEASE, LEAVE MY
CHILDREN IN PEACE.
CUT THE BULLSHIT!
IT'S HERE, I'M TELLING YOU #82.
WHO IS IT?
- CAPTAIN MUGANZA?
- WHO WANTS TO KNOW?
GOOD MORNING, CAPTAIN. WE'RE
SECURING THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
- THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS SECURE.
- OF COURSE.
WOULD YOU OPEN THE GATE? IF YOU
WOULD JUST SHOW US YOUR I.D. CARD
AND THE CARDS OF EVERYONE IN
THE HOUSE, WE WILL BE ON OUR WAY.
I JUST HAVE MY
SERVICE PASS.
THIS WON'T DO, CAPTAIN.
WE NEED TO SEE YOUR
NATIONAL I.D. CARD.
- WELL, LET ME JUST GO IN THE HOUSE...
- WAIT.
SEARCH THE HOUSE.
LISTEN, MUGANZA.
YOU'RE FROM GITARAMA?
MY FATHER WAS
A BUSINESSMAN.
- A HUTU BUSINESSMAN.
- I KNOW.
I WENT TO SCHOOL
WITH YOUR COUSIN FRANCOIS.
AND I ALSO KNOW
YOU MARRIED
A TUTSI WOMAN.
YOU CAN KEEP PLAYING A DIRTY LITTLE
GAME FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.
BUT IF I COME BACK
AND YOU'RE STILL HERE,
I'LL HAVE NO CHOICE.
LET'S GO.
CHECK THE LIST AGAIN.
THIS WAY.
ANNE-MARIE?
ANNE-MARIE,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
YES, HOW ARE YOU, PAPA?
I AM FINE.
- AND MAMA?
- SHE'S, UM, AT THE NEIGHBORS
with your brothers.
I'M SCARED.
WE CAN HEAR THE GUNS.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU ARE SAFE THERE.
YOU ARE IN
A CATHOLIC SCHOOL.
Nobody can go in there.
PAPA, I HAVE TO GO.
- THE OTHER GIRLS ARE WAITING FOR THE PHONE.
- OKAY, OKAY.
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU TOO, PAPA.
- Bye.
- BYE BYE.
GIRLS.
YOU MUST CALM DOWN.
PLEASE, ALL OF YOU,
GO TO YOUR DORMITORY.
I NEED ALL OF YOU TO GO
TO YOUR DORMITORIES NOW.
PLEASE, QUICKLY.
- MARTINE...
- QUICKLY.
- I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU.
- I'M SORRY, FATHER.
WE HAVE A SCHOOL
FULL OF TERRIFIED GIRLS.
MARTINE.
THIS IS A VERY
DIFFICULT SITUATION,
BUT WE MUST DO OUR DUTY.
WE CANNOT HARBOR REBELS.
- WE'LL HAVE TO HAND THEM OVER.
- FATHER!
THESE ARE NOT REBELS.
THESE ARE GIRLS. GIRLS YOU HAVE
BROUGHT UP AS YOUR OWN DAUGHTERS.
- NOW YOU WOULD PUT THEM OUT?
- WHAT CAN I DO, MY CHILD?
WE CANNOT PROTECT
ALL OF THEM.
I DO NOT HAVE THE POWER
TO CHANGE THIS SITUATION.
WE MUST PRAY.
WE DO NOT WANT ANOTHER MOGADISHU.
WE DON'T WANT OUR BOYS
DRAGGED NAKED IN THE STREETS.
CONGRESS WON'T HAVE IT.
THE PENTAGON WON'T HAVE IT.
- THE PRESIDENT WON'T...
- SIR, WE'RE ONLY 48 HOURS INTO THIS
AND WE ALREADY HAVE REPORTS OF OVER
THEY'RE NOT JUST KILLING TUTSIS,
THEY'RE TARGETING MODERATE HUTUS.
PRUDENCE, WHAT IS OUR
VITAL INTEREST IN RWANDA?
IF THERE IS A CRISIS, IT COULD
DESTABILIZE THE ENTIRE REGION.
MAY I?
I APPRECIATE
THE HUMAN TRAGEDY.
HERE. IF THE KILLING
IN RWANDA STARTS
THE BEST-CASE SCENARIO
ESTIMATES 20,000 DEAD.
THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO
COULD EXCEED 500,000.
IT'S JANUARY 25th, 1994
C.I.A. REPORT.
THAT'S JUST NINE
WEEKS AGO, SIR.
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT
ANY C.I.A. REPORT AGAIN.
SINCE THE CRASH
OF THE PRESIDENT'S PLANE
THE SITUATION IN RWANDA HAS
VERY QUICKLY BECOME UNSTABLE.
I JUST SPOKE
WITH THE AMBASSADOR,
AND HE REPORTS
THAT THE FIGHTING
IS LARGELY BETWEEN
THE RWANDAN MILITARY FORCES
AND THE RWANDAN
PATRIOTIC FRONT.
HAVE ANY AMERICANS BEEN HURT
OR ARE THEY BEING TARGETED?
NO, AMERICANS ARE NOT
BEING TARGETED AT THIS TIME.
AND CLEARLY, WE ARE
VERY CONCERNED
WITH THE APPROXIMATELY 255
AMERICANS THAT ARE IN THE REGION.
WHAT ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY? THE BELGIANS, THE FRENCH?
- HOW MANY COULD YOU GET OUT?
- LET ME PUT THIS IN CONTEXT.
THERE IS FIGHTING
AND THERE IS CHAOS.
THERE IS NO DATE.
THERE'S NO TIME.
WE ARE LOOKING INTO ENSURING THE
SAFETY OF ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS.
ARE YOU SATISFIED
WITH THE PROTECTION
THE RWANDAN MILITARY IS GIVING
TO THE U.S. CITIZENS?
AGAIN, THE RWANDAN MILITARY FORCES
ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF FIREFIGHTS
WITH THE RWANDAN
PATRIOTIC FRONT OR THE R.P.F.
IT IS NOT HIGH ON THEIR
LIST OF PRIORITIES
TO TAKE CARE OF THE AMERICAN
CITIZENS AT THIS POINT.
THE REBEL FORCES,
ARE THEY "TUTU" OR "HUTSI"?
- HUTU AND TUTSI.
- WHICH ONES ARE THE GOOD GUYS?
HELLO, IT'S ME.
AUGUSTIN.
CHRIST, I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO CALL YOU.
THE LINES ARE JAMMED.
I CAN'T GET THROUGH.
LISTEN, I NEED YOUR HELP.
I AM STUCK HERE WITH XAVIER.
JEANNE AND THE KIDS ARE NEXT
DOOR WITH THE BELGIAN GUY.
I need to get them
out of the city.
YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT
YOURSELF, BROTHER.
DO YOU KNOW THAT I FOUND
YOUR NAME ON THE LIST
as a Tutsi
sympathizer?
I buried it,
but it won't stay
that way for long.
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY.
I'M SAVING YOUR NECK.
AND MY FAMILY?
I AM YOUR FAMILY.
Can't do no more.
I warned you.
I KNOW. I KNOW.
YOU WERE RIGHT.
DAMN RIGHT I WAS.
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- TAKE CARE OF YOUR OWN TUTSIS, MAN.
- HONORE...
LISTEN, I BEG YOU,
TAKE MY FAMILY...
JEANNE...
JEANNE AND THE BOYS
TO THE HOTEL MILLE COLLINES.
THEY WILL BE PROTECTED.
YOU CAN GET THROUGH THE
ROADBLOCKS. PEOPLE KNOW YOU.
I DON'T LIKE IT.
I DON'T TRUST HIM.
- WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE IF HE'S COMING.
- HE'S MY BROTHER.
IF I CAN GET YOU
AND THE BOYS
TO THE HOTEL MILLE COLLINES,
YOU WILL BE SAFE.
AND ANNE-MARIE, WELL SHE
WILL BE SAFE AT HER SCHOOL.
WE WILL ALL BE SAFE.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO.
- WHERE ARE THEY? WE NEED TO LEAVE NOW.
- BROTHER.
LISTEN, THE GUARDS ARE GETTING
SERIOUSLY DRUNK AT THE ROADBLOCKS.
- WHO IS THIS?
- FELICIE, XAVIER'S FIANCEE.
- YOU SAID WIFE AND CHILDREN.
- SHE IS FAMILY.
OH, I PRESUME
SHE'S A TUTSI, TOO.
COME ON, BOYS, GET IN THE CAR.
- I NEVER ASKED.
- WHAT?
HONORE WON'T TAKE FELICIE.
- IF I'M A PROBLEM...
- EVERYBODY GOES.
- LISTEN, AUGUSTIN...
- FELICIE, GET IN THIS CAR.
YOU TOO, AUGUSTIN.
LET'S GO.
HONEY, I'M STAYING.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- I'M GOING TO JOIN YOU LATER.
- WE HAVE TO GO.
- AUGUSTIN, GET IN THIS CAR.
I CAN'T.
AUGUSTIN, TELL HER.
JEANNE, LISTEN TO ME.
- I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE WITHOUT...
- LISTEN TO ME.
JEANNE, HIS NAME
WAS ON A LIST.
- OH MY GOD.
- JEANNE. JEANNE...
- JEANNE.
- NO.
- JEANNE, JEANNE, JEANNE, JEANNE.
- NO!
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
AUGUSTIN, THEY NEED
TO GO NOW.
- PLEASE, AUGUSTIN.
- NO, NO, NO, YOU NEED TO GET BACK IN THE CAR.
- IF SOMETHING HAPPENS...
- NO.
IT'S GOING TO BE FINE.
PAPA, WE DON'T WANT TO GO.
LOOK, GO BACK
IN THE CAR, EH?
COME ON, DO IT.
DO IT!
AUGUSTIN, WE NEED TO GO.
JEANNE.
YOU NEED TO GET
IN THE CAR.
COME ON, BOYS.
GET IN THE CAR.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
OKAY. GO.
OKAY.
PAPA WILL BE FINE, EH?
I'M A SOLDIER.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WE DON'T TEMPT THE DEVIL.
- I THOUGHT EVERYONE KNEW YOU.
- I AM NOT ALONE.
- SHIT.
- WHAT?
THAT WAS NOT THERE BEFORE.
HEY, STOP THE CAR.
YES.
I WORK FOR RADIO RTLM.
HEY!
YES?
OH, I'M SO SILLY.
WE'RE JUST GOING
TO THE SUPERMARKET
AND I LEFT THEM HOME.
WE WERE IN SUCH A HURRY WITH
THE CHILDREN AND THE NEW CURFEW.
LISTEN, BROTHER,
JUST GIVE US A BREAK?
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
EVERYBODY OUT.
LISTEN...
I AM A PARTY MEMBER.
I AM AUTHORIZED TO TAKE THIS
WOMAN TO RUN SOME ERRANDS.
LISTEN, I... LET ME
CALL COLONEL SENTORE.
HE CAN SORT THIS OUT, OKAY?
CLEAR THIS UP.
- THIS IS NOT GOOD.
- WHAT'S NOT GOOD, MOMMY?
NOTHING, I JUST WANT
YOUR UNCLE TO HURRY UP.
HEY, AMAKURU.
THIS IS HONORE BUTERA.
I'M HERE AT THE ROADBLOCK
ON RUE DE L'HOPITAL.
NO, SIR. THEY WON'T LET ME PASS.
YES, SIR.
YES, SIR.
THEY ARE MY FAMILY.
YES, SIR.
OF COURSE, SIR. YOU KNOW
I WORK FOR THE PARTY.
OF COURSE.
FOR THE CAUSE, ALWAYS.
HE WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU.
YES, SIR?
OKAY, SIR.
OKAY,
LOCK THE DOORS!
OH MY GOD.
STAY DOWN!
STOP IT.
- NAME?
- AUGUSTIN MUGANZA.
- NAME OF DETAINEE?
- BUTERA.
HE'LL BE RIGHT
WITH YOU.
- NO, I CAN'T.
- I'M SORRY?
I THOUGHT THAT...
- NO, I CAN'T.
- HE'S ON HIS WAY.
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL HIM YOURSELF?
THE VISIT WOULD
DO HIM GOOD.
NO.
PLEASE TELL HIM I HAD
TO LEAVE ON EMERGENCY.
I'M SORRY.
DAMN.
YOU GET THAT THING
TO WORK?
YEAH.
SO WHAT'S WRONG?
I SAW A MILITARY TRUCK
HEADING TO THE FRENCH SCHOOL.
THEY MUST BE
ROUNDING PEOPLE UP
FOR AN EVACUATION
LIKE IN '92.
I MEAN...
IF WE CAN GET THERE,
WE HAVE A CHANCE.
- THERE ARE TOO MANY ROADBLOCKS.
- NO, IT'S NOT THAT FAR.
IT'S A MILLION MILES,
AUGUSTIN.
I SAY WE JUST LAY LOW.
THIS...
THING CAN'T
LAST FOREVER.
SHE SAID YOUR NAME
ON THE RADIO.
YOU HEARD MY NAME
ON THE RADIO?
LOOK, WE CAN GET
THROUGH THE ROADBLOCKS.
THEY'RE NOT TRAINED
SOLDIERS.
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
THE ROADBLOCK
ON THE LEFT.
THEY SEEM DRUNKEST.
SHALL WE?
LET'S DO IT.
LET'S PUSH IT.
- SHOOT ME!
- BACK OFF. YOU CANNOT GO!
SHOOT ME! I DON'T WANT
TO DIE WITH THE MACHETE.
PLEASE, SHOOT ME
WITH U.N. BULLET!
PLEASE! PLEASE!
WHY? WHY CAN'T WE
GET IN THERE?
PLEASE TAKE THE CHILDREN WITH YOU.
WE HAVE...
WE HAVE ORDERS!
TAKE THE CHILDREN
WITH YOU!
PLEASE?!
XAVIER!
MOVE IT!
MOVE!
GET IN THE CAR!
- OUT OF THE CAR.
- WE'RE WITH THE CONVOY.
EVERYBY OUT!
EVERYBODY OUT!
- SHOW ME YOUR PAPERS.
- HEY, HEY, HEY...
WE ARE WITH THE CONVOY.
ASK THE OFFICER
AND HE WILL TELL YOU.
MOVE THESE OBSTACLES AWAY.
WE HAVE TO GO.
HEY LIEUTENANT!
S'IL VOUS PLAIT,
LIEUTENANT.
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE I AM WITH
YOU. WE ARE IN THE SAME CONVOY.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- IS HE WITH YOU?
- THE SAME CONVOY!
- SHUT UP...
AND LET
THE WHITE MAN TALK.
- ARE THESE PEOPLE WITH YOU?
- OUR CONVOY IS THE JEEPS AND THE TRUCKS.
I'M SORRY.
I'VE ORDERS...
ONLY EXPATRIATES.
GO! GO!
REMOVE THAT THING!
GO!
XAVIER MUYANGO?
WHO IS XAVIER MUYANGO?
I AM.
AREN'T YOU THE TRAITOR
XAVIER MUYANGO WE'VE HEARD
ABOUT ON THE RADIO?
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.
MOVE OVER WITH THAT GROUP.
EVERYBODY ELSE,
GET OFF. GET OFF!
GET OVER, GET OVER!
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU, EH?
- MOVE OVER! FORGET SOMETHING?
- I CAN SPEAK FOR THIS MAN!
HE IS LOYAL.
HE IS A GOOD SOLDIER.
THE ARMY IS FILLED
WITH TRAITORS.
THEN I WILL TAKE HIM
TO THE HEADQUARTERS MYSELF.
- I'LL TAKE...
- YOU WANT TO HELP?
YOU WANT TO HELP?
- GIVE HIM A MACHETE.
- NO.
WE DON'T WASTE BULLETS
ON COCKROACH TRAITORS.
AUGUSTIN,
XAVIER... XAVIER...
MUYANGO.
MUYANGO,
STAND UP!
COME ON,
LET'S GO.
LET'S GO.
IT'S NOT GONNA HELP.
- SH... HEY, HEY! HEY!
- LET'S GO, LET'S GO.
- HEY!
- IT'S NOT GONNA HELP. HE'S DEAD.
- OUl?
- Colonel Bagosora,
THIS IS ASSISTANT
SECRETARY BUSHNELL.
MRS. BUSHNELL,
WHAT A WONDERFUL SURPRISE.
I REGRET WE DIDN'T MEET DURING
YOUR LAST VISIT IN KIGALI.
SIR, I'M CALLING TO ADVISE YOU
THAT WE VIEW THE SITUATION
VERY SERIOUSLY.
PRESIDENT CLINTON
IS VERY CONCERNED.
HOW KIND OF THE PRESIDENT
TO BE THINKING OF ME.
WE HAVE RECEIVED REPORTS
THAT THERE HAS BEEN...
THE U.N. REPORTS ARE VERY EXAGGERATED.
THERE HAS BEEN SOME TROUBLE.
AND NATURALLY, WE HAVE
TO DEFEND OUR PEOPLE.
YOU MUST TAKE ACTION TO
CHANGE THE COURSE OF EVENTS.
BUT IT'S THE REBELS,
THEY ATTACKED US.
AND NOW THE PEOPLE HAVE
RISEN UP TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.
COLONEL, WE KNOW WHO'S
PERPETRATING THESE KILLINGS.
YOU CAN SEE ALL THE WAY
FROM WASHINGTON?
MRS. BUSHNELL,
IF THERE WAS A CSEFIRE WE
MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING,
but now the situation
is very difficult.
VERY DIFFICULT, MADAME.
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE.
NO, YOU DO NOT NEED
A CEASEFIRE
TO STOP THIS
HATE RADIO BROADCAST.
MONSIEUR BAGOSORA,
IF YOU DO NOT STOP THE KILLING,
THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES.
REALLY?
YOU WILL SEND
THE MARINES?
WE HAVE NO OIL HERE.
WE HAVE NO DIAMONDS.
WE HAVE NOTHING YOU NEED IN
RWANDA. WHY WOULD YOU COME?
IF YOU DO NOT
CEASE THE KILLINGS,
I PROMISE YOU,
YOU WILL BE HELD
PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE.
I WILL SEE
WHAT WE CAN DO.
MAMA, MAMA!
