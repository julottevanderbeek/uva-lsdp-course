Dedicated to those
who lived through these events
SAFE CONDUCT
She's coming. Hop to it!
Got the flowers?
I was taking them up.
Clear the whole floor.
Everybody out of sight! Move it!
Come back in 5 minutes!
Just one minute.
Like last Tuesday.
Carnations? Not for an actress!
I told you!
She'll murder me! Marcel, help me!
She's here, ladies!
To your rooms, please!
Him and his dame!
What a fuss he makes!
You don't know who this "dame" is!
Everyone knows. It's Suzanne Raymond.
I saw her movies...
Please, out of sight, all of you!
Shoo!
If you need cigs...
Maybe later. In you go.
Take care of that cough.
Out of sight! Thanks!
Shoo!
Not again!
Got the champagne?
Snap to it!
What a mess!
What did I do to deserve this?
See him? The Kraut in room 25.
Get in here.
He threatened me again.
Someday I'll sock him.
Aren't you gorgeous!
These things...
always happen to you.
Gorgeous, gorgeous...
You smell so sweet.
What a pretty little puppy nose,
nice and cold.
True, I'm freezing.
God, what a winter!
What a winter!
Think so?
See how I slipped in?
Nobody saw me.
But still,
I felt so sad.
So sad.
- I didn't get the part.
- What part? Why?
The Cayatte movie. The False Mistress.
Can I have some tea?
Steaming hot tea?
Better than tea...
Champagne!
Champagne's too cold.
But it's a cold that warms.
Tea.
Tea?
Then tea it is.
Darrieux will get it.
They said it's either her or me.
Nonsense! I shouldn't have bothered.
It was made for Darrieux.
Everything's made for her.
She's perfect from take one.
I'm never sure of myself.
Nothing comes easy.
I'm fed up. Fed up!
I'm such a goose!
How can you say that?
Would I write for a goose?
Hold on...
Your passionate lover
- It'll be little Francois Perier -
recites a letter about your frolics.
Your husband may have intercepted it.
You: "You really wrote all that?"
Him: "Yes, my love."
You: "Must you always go on
about things we did together?"
"What's the point? I was there!"
That's nice!
That's me all over.
I just love it.
I adore you!
Put this outside the door.
You knock, then scoot!
Come on, now!
The champagne.
Stay.
Go on, then.
But be careful. And the tea!
Ask for tea.
Do you have any tea?
Yes, tea.
Don't have any?
That's okay. Thanks.
They have none... Tea, coffee.
Why not real sugar?
Where do I put this?
Damn!
What's the matter?
I've made a mess!
The script for Roland Tual,
Love Letters.
He's expecting it tomorrow.
It soaks up like a blotter!
Look at that!
Hear that?
Rumbling.
It's thunder.
Come over here!
Not thunder, planes.
Lots of them.
Only the Germans have planes.
They wouldn't bomb Paris,
they're in it!
No, it's freezing out!
I have to see!
They're far away, over the suburbs...
What is it?
It's coming from above.
What a sight!
What's that light? It's beautiful.
It's an air raid, all right.
- Close it! It's freezing!
- They're bombing!
Close your window, Mr. Jean!
The Brits are bombing Renault!
Close it, Jean!
Down we go!
Never any privacy!
First the champagne,
then the phone, and now planes!
I refuse to be seen in a shelter!
We're calmly going to do
what I came for.
Calmly? We're being bombed!
And if we're being bombed,
I can't do a thing.
Let me handle this.
To the shelters!
Is there a doctor?
Shut off the mains!
No, Mr. Devaivre!
To the shelters!
I'm getting my son.
He's safe. Your wife's here.
It's you! Got a flashlight?
- I'll get one?
- C'mon!
Find something to cover them.
Sheets and blankets.
Simone!
You okay?
I'm okay.
Seen Dr. Pelletier?
The raid's over.
I'm not so sure.
The flares looked like fireworks
at first.
- What're you doing?
- Taking him.
It's 60¢´ here with the windows closed.
At home, it's 34¢´.
You sure?
Take the kid!
Please, can you help me?
Not the small ones, Roger!
The big ones, under your nose!
The Brits' bombs
work better than worms!
What're you doing?
Fishing! "The miracle of the fishes!"
We have to finish the scene tonight.
We'll be right in. The power's out.
We'll save you one.
We're already behind.
We'll be here till 6 a.m. again.
How is it outside?
Not a pretty sight. Bodies everywhere.
They were really popping!
And real close!
The phone's busy. George sent a cyclist
to the power station.
The bridges are out.
How do I get home?
My husband'll be worried sick.
Fish, you guys!
There's plenty for everyone!
Fish?
If the cables are damaged,
we're in for a long wait.
Check them. If it comes back on,
we don't wait.
It will be a while.
We'd do the same.
Renault makes trucks and motors...
They come and bomb, it's fair play.
Fair play, no!
There are the rules of war.
You don't bomb the wounded,
priests, or artists!
Boulogne's full of artists,
and movie studios.
Everyone knows it.
The civilized world, anyway.
As if the civilized world still existed.
I've got a theater gig next.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have to finish this long scene.
We have very little film left.
They're striking the set tomorrow.
So give it all you've got. Thanks!
Spare the candles!
They have to match.
Mr. Le Chanois is waiting upstairs.
I'm going up.
How's your baby? Not too scared...?
Don't waste your breath.
He never stops.
I call him Speedy.
I was about to leave.
Sandwich.
I also brought you carbon paper.
This is an epic!
Read it later.
What if my wife can't decipher it?
Here's the dialogue for Salou...
The power! I have to get back.
Hold on!
Comrades are getting nabbed.
There are informers everywhere.
- I know them.
- Not all of them!
Nicolas Hayer beat it
before the Fritz came knocking.
Mickey Bouladoux got pinched.
It stinks!
Mickey?
So?
Clouzot offered me a job.
Aurenche gave up adapting
a Nerval story.
Clouzot put me on it.
Tourneur needs an assistant.
You!
But Clouzot's Continental,
and Continental's German!
Exactly! When you're in
the lion's jaws, he can't bite.
Even the French police
can't snoop at Continental.
That's 50% less hassle.
And the other 50%?
I'll think it over.
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- I'll call you.
You can't. I moved.
Again?
Bretons are great travelers.
We dolly in on the table.
The table for two.
The 103 on the table for two!
Quiet on the set!
We're back to work and glad of it!
Places, everyone!
Off with your overcoats!
I'm cramped. I need to pull back.
Mr. Arrignon needs room.
Push back the sound booth.
- Buy some chocolate?
- We're rehearsing!
I'm interested.
What's that funny smell?
Fish. In the sound booth.
Not much left.
Move me back, please.
A little more.
- Mark it.
- Done, sir.
Tench is no better or worse than carp.
It tastes like whatever it's cooked in.
Cook it in sauce, it tastes good.
Cook it in muck, it tastes like muck.
Stop the hammers!
The hammers!
Silence!
Miss Gautier's shawl, please.
This wait had too many minutes.
Try to be not too dumb!
Camera!
Scene 82, take 1!
Action!
Punish the Vichy Torturers
The grips had a good catch.
Here's our share.
Good. Jacques's coming for dinner.
He just called.
I was at the nursery. It's quiet.
There's a card from your brother Louis.
From Germany.
Awful handwriting!
Is it the cold?
What kind of fish?
- Tench.
- Any good?
Better than barbel
and not as good as carp.
I brought you some carbon paper.
Almost new.
And a new tract to type in 7 copies?
It's not "traiter," it's "traitor."
"Someday soon Berlin and Tokyo
may burn under Allied bombs."
You believe that?
Cleaned, scaled and chopped,
we could make soup.
If we have gas to cook.
You know Nerval's The Magic Hand?
Jean-Paul backed me as assistant.
He's scripting it.
I can't decide.
You two get along well.
The producer's the hitch. Continental.
The Fritz?
Do what you think is best...
The elevator's off limits.
For those gentlemen only.
Mr. Tourneur's expecting us.
The glass door at the back: Greven.
The big cheese.
On the right, Bauermeister.
Watch your step with him.
Clouzot's there.
He runs the script department.
Greetings, Aurenche. No regrets?
For The Magic Hand? None.
But you'll do fine.
Updating Nerval stumped me.
But you'll find a way.
As I told Greven
Either you can or you can't.
Or, you will or you won't.
Did Herr Doktor understand you?
He acted like it.
He pesters the hell out of me!
I'm running late.
What's Clouzot like?
A tough nut, but he plays straight.
Here, here and here... our offices.
At the end, a minefield!
Mr. Tourneur... Jean Devaivre.
You have a fine reputation.
I know you finished
Mediterranean Alert.
How would you describe
an assistant director's job?
The director's in charge.
He bears full responsibility,
but only has 2 eyes.
An extra pair comes in handy.
Have you read
Le Chanois's script?
The treatment. It's not finished.
Bryau's always cold.
Von Schertel... SD.
SD?
Controls the SS.
- What's he doing at Continental?
- Renting space.
Understand German?
My wife gets by.
Me, not a word.
Many speak excellent French.
My rule is simple: make good films.
Artistic and script matters
see Mr. Clouzot.
For administrative issues
Mr. Bauermeister.
Like all directors, actors
and key technicians,
you'll be given a pass.
You must be ready for an August shoot.
You'll have 28 days.
Come, Tourneur, let's have lunch.
Spaak told me about A Shady Business.
Balzac. Fine.
I won't work for Continental. Period!
I can't keep turning Greven down.
You must help me.
When you won't, you won't.
Sure, sure. Stop kicking the mahogany.
It scratches, too.
Hold on...
Don't move.
There. Sure I'll help you.
But stop kicking the furniture.
It's distracting.
Helping a friend like you
will be easy. How?
Put me under contract.
Fabulous!
Avoid the rock and the soft spot.
I'll have a project next month.
I need a contract today. Predated.
I signed one 2 weeks ago.
With whom?
With you. In this office.
It's easy enough to understand.
I won't work for the Jerries,
or end up in Berlin or in prison.
I keep turning Greven down,
I need an excuse. You must save me.
First finish Three-Way Romance.
It's finished.
We need something else,
for 3, 6 months. 10 years!
Something else...
I have it.
Double Six. The play. Read it.
- A play? By whom?
- Achard.
- You mean Domino.
- I wanted The Lover from Borneo.
It's a dream title...
Borneo, Africa, tigers...
There are no tigers in Africa.
And Borneo's in Asia.
Movies are made of dreams,
and dreams can't be mapped out.
I have something else.
Roland Tual will produce
if you distribute.
- The title?
- Love Letters. Listen...
No, no, I'll take it!
I'm sobbing already. Love Letters.
It's worth its weight.
We'll fool Greven.
I have Gravey.
His contract is a plague!
- He asking a lot?
- Yes, and a pound of butter a week.
- What for?
- For bartering.
To work! I'm head over heels in work.
Find me pre-war subjects.
Passion, gaslamps, backstairs...
- Back-streets.
- Back-streets. With peepholes.
I can never keep up with you.
So my wife says.
She's a great bridge player.
She costs me.
She play for money?
But if she plays well, she wins?
All the time.
So why does she cost you?
It's beyond me.
Why are we talking about this?
Tell Greven
we have a 3-picture contract.
Strange man! Seen his office chest?
- The what?
- The chest.
Storage chest?
No, man's chest.
The head... like on statues!
Like buster.
He hangs his coat and hat on it.
So I saw. And?
Mussolini with a hat on his head!
You mean Hitler.
Logical for a German dignitary.
The thing has a forelock: Mussolini!
Mussolini's forelock!
The guy starts a sentence,
but you never know...
Did I sign a contract or not?
Why does he keep doing that?
He had a lobotomy.
But he must do it for a reason.
He thinks you're a Jew.
Tomorrow, I'll have lettuce.
What brings you here?
I was in the neighborhood.
For you.
Shall I get Olga?
Good timing. She's free at this hour.
A Comedie Francaise actor
mentioned you.
One who often plays priests.
Can I take those?
Oh, Jeannot!
My fingers are numb.
Goddamned suitcases!
The handles cut through your fingers.
I hate 'em!
A wheelbarrow's better.
Maybe not on a staircase...
They say it's very nice in French.
Very sad.
Not too heavy?
This place has become total chaos!
A new table?
A gift from Paul.
He deals in hot furniture.
Madame knows him
from his vice squad days.
He rents space upstairs
and pays in services.
It's just for a day or two.
Until I find...
There's no hurry.
Make yourself at home.
- You want a bath?
- Still have hot water?
Sure! For the Germans.
Put those in the closet.
They'll wrinkle in your suitcase.
This all the same story?
No. I wish it was.
- How do you keep track?
- I manage.
If not, I start over.
It's better sometimes.
Besides, clutter has a certain charm.
Honeysuckle vines are lot more fun
than matches in a box,
or a military parade.
I keep track very easily.
You don't look like it.
My life's a mess, not my papers.
It's my own fault. I always say yes.
- Because you're nice.
- Maybe so, but...
I say yes to producers,
hucksters, and women.
So I'm broke, I have 4 scripts
and 3 women on my hands.
No, 4 women and 3 scripts.
Come on. It's cold.
Those handbags in the closet...
You collect them?
That's for later.
When I open a shop.
I won't end up in a sailor's brothel.
I'll have my own business.
A leather goods shop.
Luxury stuff.
Handbags are so pretty.
Even empty, they're pretty.
It's fine, but...
The set's too big.
Too wide for Stage 4.
Two yards too long.
With a 35, we won't frame it all.
If I place it diagonally on A...
But on the A there's the gallery.
We have to cut it down.
Or take out this wall.
I noted the camera angles
on the floorplan.
I'll work it out.
Cut this, maybe.
Add arch. Gives volume.
And the paintings there?
They're for the painter's studio.
I painted two, small ones.
Good. Arches, cats...
Clouzot doesn't like
Le Chanois's dialogue.
He says it lacks "punch."
That's the word he used.
Here are both versions.
You decide.
I'll read them tonight, sir.
For the historical explanation
of the severed hand,
we have to simplify. Too long.
Or we ask for an extra day or two.
We said 28 days. 28!
If there is an extension,
it will be an extension of 600 miles.
We'll send you to Babelsberg
to study German production methods.
And if we sent you to Stalingrad,
to study crawling methods.
Here's your pass.
Mr. Greven just signed Palau.
Good. You won't be sorry.
And your contract? Bring it in signed.
He'll be great as the Devil. Palau...
He's got funny eyes, like a duck.
Palau... No?
Talk him into it. It's Dad's birthday.
Make an effort.
You realize the work load he has?
That's just it. He needs a break,
and it's Sunday. So come...
"People of Paris, the French must fight!
"Turn out in force and demonstrate!
"The gas is on only 4 hours a day!"
The union must be joking!
Go and fight...
With what? And why? For gas?
Jacques, please!
C'mon, this is a riot.
He has you type Communist tracts
but he was on the other side.
He fights a war, great!
But he works for the Germans.
Not for. Under the Germans.
So how's Clouzot's dialogue?
Your brother's getting...
You slave weekends, for them!
I work on films. For Tourneur,
Clouzot and myself.
To learn. And I'm always learning.
Then shoot. Direct your first film.
Not now.
Not until we've kicked them out.
And I haven't signed a contract.
I never will.
So how about Sunday?
Are you coming?
Can't we put it back a week?
We'll celebrate Christmas
on Bastille Day.
Mom found a duck and turnips.
We can set it back.
But the duck's plucked.
It's this Sunday or never.
I'll come with the baby.
Jean will drop by.
I took two tracts.
I'll come for lunch.
I love duck!
Devaivre?
This is Didot. Marc Valbel's friend.
Hold on.
Last year you had some apples.
Got any left?
I need two.
Remember where we met with Marc?
Sure, I do.
I'll meet you there.
- Now?
- Now.
I have to run. I won't be long.
- You know, I'm going...
- You said the less we know...
I'll put the baby to bed.
I'll do the ironing.
I'll wait up for you.
I have a pass.
You're getting thin.
Over there.
Let's see them.
Good.
Let's go.
- Where they from?
- I stole them the day of the Armistice.
I took them home.
You got a head start.
"A gray duck, a blue duck, a white duck
"The white duck walks behind
the blue duck walks ahead
"The white duck is fattest,
"I'll sell it for 20 francs...
Would you have fired?
You picked up some coal.
Very clever.
You don't talk much.
Usually, the guys I take along
run off at the mouth.
In three minutes, bang!
Any special reason
for going after the Fritz?
I just want them out, that's all.
Let's go.
And the van?
I don't know whose it is.
So long!
Polish it good!
Activate the work!
You really pulled it off.
The statue... A great idea!
It adds to the scene.
Every camera angle is a good one.
And the paintings, great!
It can all be dismantled.
The Krauts won't believe their eyes.
"In Babelsberg we do this, we do that."
But look what we can do
with the little they give us.
Nice work, Mr. Andrejew!
This one.
The latest tract. Make 8 copies.
For the art department.
"I hear the sound
of boots, boots, boots!"
"It's the first carabinier!"
Greetings!
- How are your trotters?
- We manage!
It's dumb losing your toes in Russia
when your name's Softi.
How many was it?
Frostbitten toes?
You bet, it was 40 below!
No time to go out for a pee.
I got some liquid butter. Want some?
No, thanks.
You can tell there's a war on.
Even in June it's freezing!
War shakes up the skies, too.
I got you darlings lung
from the butcher's.
They gave it to me in a shoebox
to avoid jealousy.
Then getting it by the concierge,
a fortune!
You're rich folks' cats!
But you know,
the poor are the same.
They go hungry to feed their pets.
Crumbs for birds, birds for cats!
If only they'd eat them!
You might say, if they're poor,
it's because they're not too bright.
I got us some calf liver!
- Taking down what she says?
- It's automatic.
Read me something you wrote?
It's been a bad day.
No, wait...
Here's something I like...
A scene between the count,
Douce's father,
- And the beautiful young woman.
- The teacher? Like your mom?
She was a governess.
The count says something funny.
She laughs. That makes him happy.
He: "I love to see you laugh.
You don't laugh enough."
She: "But, sir,
I've never been so happy."
He's very moved.
"Truly? How I wish
to see you carefree!"
I like that: "carefree."
I tried "happy" but it's too dull.
"Easy-going" didn't fit.
That's more like us girls.
"Easy women," like they say.
Carefree is better.
I love to see you laugh.
You don't laugh enough.
I fear this house is too gloomy,
too austere for you.
I've never been so happy.
Truly? How I wish to see you carefree.
You even write on death notices?
Whatever comes to hand.
- A relative?
- An uncle.
Was he rich?
He was old and blew every cent.
You come from a weird family! Books!
I'm getting nowhere!
And when you get nowhere,
you repeat yourself. You ramble.
So that's why you were sighing.
Luckily, Bost will fix it.
The man you work with?
Pierre Bost is gifted. He's a writer.
And you aren't?
I'm a juggler, a pied piper.
- A poet.
That's sweet
Known this Mr. Bost long?
We worked on a film 5 years ago,
but not at the same time.
We only just met.
He was released recently
for excessive thinness.
His release form read
"Displays a pathetic look."
Bost is terrific.
I want to dazzle him. It inspires me.
It forces me to...
Yes, I want to dazzle Bost.
If I didn't know you, I might wonder
Does he like women or men?
Women, naturally. Too much!
The girls' mail. Take it up.
Checkups are on Friday.
Do they mean
next Friday or every Friday?
At least the Germans write in French.
That one's fine.
Now the 112 on the statue.
Say, Thirard, for the street scene...
Walking my dog this morning,
I noticed long shadows.
It produced quite a terrific,
mysterious effect.
That's what I want: very long shadows!
You'll have them, sir.
I need a hand here.
I told you, no smoking.
What cig?
Stand in for Mr. Fresnay.
The camera will follow you.
- Your butts are gross!
- Not at all!
If you were as well groomed
as my cigs...
I steam 'em, dry 'em, comb 'em,
mix 'em with endive,
and I add corn silk.
A real treat!
"...so I think life is short,
and hell eternal."
- 48 secs. 79 feet.
- We have the film?
No, sir.
I'll cut the shot in two.
I need 55 feet.
With a short end of 65 feet
and a quick clap, it'll do.
Hear that, men?
The first take has to be right.
Our first takes
have been right for weeks!
They're coming!
They're coming!
Butts!
My extinguisher!
Just checking!
Arthur, watch the sound booth!
A swivel stool for Mr. Fresnay!
How long, Mr. Thirard?
Problems, Mr. Nee?
None, fella.
Get that tattle filter out of the way.
Mr. Bauermeister!
I'm glad to see you.
Shooting only with short ends
is a juggling act.
We need extra film stock.
Not a foot. You ate up too much film
for the early scenes.
The mountain inn set...
Too many angles, too many takes.
You went too far,
so you're punished: B1497short ends.
I know you'll do just fine.
Your hair's too long.
A matter of dignity.
They won't provide longer short ends,
so they shorten the hair.
Besides, long hair is filthy.
Gentlemen, to work!
- Hello, Mr. Manuel.
- Is Mr. Tourneur still here?
He's in his office.
I came to tell him
I won't be scoring his film.
You're quitting?
Look after yourself, sir.
The wind has to change someday.
Children, Paul needs the table.
Relax, he'll replace it.
Sorry. I sold this one.
That's business!
No hurry. My boys won't be here
for half an hour.
They'll have another one.
So, you're in the movies?
Quite a world! You're lucky.
I love artists!
She can tell you.
Especially famous artists.
I had Raimu over for dinner here.
I live upstairs.
Raimu!
A quart of olive oil got him here!
You know any stars? I'll invite them.
Name one, I'll see to it.
Not everyone likes olive oil.
Anything!
I can get anything. I have connections.
Give me some names.
- Off the top of my head?
- Let's hear it.
Alerme.
Debucourt.
Gravey.
Sorry, I don't know him...
Women, rather. Women are pretty.
I have perfume.
Stockings.
Moreno.
Marguerite Moreno.
That old bag? He pulling my leg?
He's a fan. He's seen your films.
He can talk about them.
It's just a lunch.
Anything more is your business.
What's this guy do?
He's in business. Like everyone.
Business, business! What kind?
Property, I think.
He deals in furniture.
He's an antique dealer?
Yes... I don't know. Maybe.
He may not know gothic
from Louis Seize,
but he trades furniture
on the black market.
We're his guests.
You'll get a gift of your choice.
Nothing to it!
Except it's in a shady place.
You'll like the Madame.
Will I like your doll?
Olga's like a little sister to me.
Okay, okay, I'll come.
I want oysters, foie gras...
And for the gift: coffee.
Coffee beans... Watch my makeup!
Real coffee.
But I warn you: no Germans.
Not at the table.
- It's so Chinese!
- It's oriental.
I asked Reine to accompany me.
My seamstress and friend.
Reine Sorignal.
Why, of course.
A friend, Marinette Burguiere.
Come this way...
I'm delighted to have you here, children.
They're just passing through!
We'll go upstairs.
Your Suzanne's a looker.
You're quite a couple!
Watch the steps.
It's waxed Prussian-style.
Nice!
Sorry, it's like a junk shop here.
There's no room.
The table, the statue...
I've seen this before... It's magnificent!
Oysters! I must be dreaming.
Never too old!
A promise is a promise.
Abyssinian. A good pound.
Thanks so much.
Nothing like pre-war coffee.
For you...
They're autographed.
Why do you always do period films?
For the gowns?
I don't write my roles. Fortunately.
People are scrambling for fabric.
True, fabric is hard to come by.
Designers don't have that problem.
They just have to pay.
Money buys everything.
A period film's a good medium
for putting ideas across.
Nowadays, any critical allusion to
the army, the church, the family...
The police.
The police... It's censored!
In suit and tie, you're a public threat.
But say it in a period costume...
Other times, other ways.
Cheers!
To us!
Mouton-Rothschild 1929.
It's not dishwater!
You make a lot?
Goodness, yes.
How much?
Excuse me?
Sorry. I'm nosey.
It's no secret.
In a play, I get 4,000 francs
per performance.
Really?
But in a movie, I make up for it.
I can earn 30,000.
That's more like it.
How about you?
It's pretty unpredictable with us.
There are ups and downs.
But it takes stamina.
Do you know Mr. Giraudoux?
Jean Giraudoux?
Sure, I know him. By name.
I mean in person.
No. But I think I might, some day.
Juliette, more chestnuts!
I know him.
Jean used to take me
to lunch with him at Louvre Hotel.
He's really got manners.
And education.
And goodness.
He's not paid what he's worth, either.
Some more pheasant, darling?
You look lovely.
Every man for himself and God for me!
Juliette will bring cigars and coffee.
You're having fun.
The kid's a gas!
She asked what I earn
on dresses per month. She totted it up
and said I'd earn more
with a leather goods shop.
You pushing me?
No, you're the one who's pushing.
You ask me: "Is Max Ernst is a Jew?"
I answer: "Who gives a damn!"
"A great artist?"
Absolutely.
"Can one be an artist and a Jew?"
Certainly.
"But I won't denounce any."
Then: "Is Celine a great writer?" "Yes!"
"You approve his anti-Semitic work?"
"I don't read the rags he writes for."
"So, you're a Jew-lover."
Mostly, I've been a Jewess-lover!
I may be drunk, but it won't stop me
from speaking my mind!
He's back again!
With his net!
- You sure?
- I saw him.
Take a look.
He's a bit thick!
Dirty creep!
Who?
What's this about?
It's just Camille.
A guy who catches cats.
Cats?
What's he do with all those cats?
He skins them or sells them
for food, who knows?
Maybe they served us cat.
No, it had feathers.
- Calm down.
- I'll punch him out!
I'd warned him.
Nothing's dumber than an anti-Semite!
Listen to yourself!
What are they doing?
They're hitting him!
Oh, my God!
Take him away!
Shit, split it again!
You're crazy! He's dangerous.
He's a cop for the Germans.
I've wrangled with cops before.
Please, Jean, calm down.
Do it for me.
He started, I'll finish.
He's good for the prison infirmary.
I fixed him good.
Beating up a tramp in his 60s...!
He gets this way.
He's overworked.
So when he drinks, he collapses.
Mr. Tourneur, could I add...?
- How much time?
- Three minutes.
Sure, they're real pearls.
Move the table closer.
There was an extra here.
Hear that, Jacques?
Hop to it!
This is take 59?
Don't touch what's on your plate.
- Not even the lettuce.
- The chicken looks yummy.
It's not chicken, it's rutabaga.
Like the rest.
Carved. And raw.
But we have to look like we're eating.
So look like it, without eating.
Character acting, right?
How low are you framing?
Just under her treasure chest.
- A lot of chest! Get a shawl.
- It's my endowment!
A shawl for the young lady!
You'll be on Ladies' Delight next.
- So what?
- I want a part.
A real role. No more extra work.
- What's a real role?
- You know.
Three scenes with three lines.
For a dozen eggs.
- Eggs aren't rare.
- A rabbit, then.
Okay, but with six eggs.
- 6 eggs and half a rabbit.
- The liver included.
For tomorrow. I have guests.
Mr. Fresnay, on the set!
Mr. Fresnay's right here!
Mr. Fresnay's on the set, always ready!
Lift your boom when the kid exits.
You bet! We'll lift it.
Ready, ladies and gents?
Care to see the set-up, sir?
What's with gramps?
We're going to shoot!
My wife's been incarcerated
by the police in Vittel.
She still has a US passport.
She's American. I'm worried.
I understand, sir.
My mind's not on this.
So if you'd fill in for me...
Count on me, sir.
Go to it, fella. We're behind you.
Okay. The camera goes here, with a 35.
At first, we don't see Mr. Larquey,
only his shadow.
His name is Angel.
I want a strange, eerie effect.
You'll have it, sir.
Rehearsal. Silence.
Don't wrinkle my tie!
It's a bad idea.
- It's like a wax museum.
- No, you'll see.
There's no mystery.
We have to imagine the hand.
If it doesn't work, we cut it.
This will go great guns, fellas!
We'll see!
Thanks for my script.
What about it?
For backing it against Clouzot's.
Thanks!
Yours was shorter.
I'm not a philanthropist.
So we'll make a little deal.
Today, one cent.
Tomorrow, two cents...
It gives you time to make a decision.
Doubling it to infinity.
You know what infinity's like?
I know. I've been there.
It's quite nice.
Cut!
Not only great guns, but howitzers!
I'll lead the way.
Don't buy it, mister, don't buy it!
Quiet! You sorcerer!
And the shadows, sir?
His name's Angel so he thinks
he's everyone's guardian.
It's very good.
I couldn't have done better.
Thank you.
- You believe in that?
- Why shouldn't I?
But it's impossible.
You have no valid reason to refuse.
I do! I'm under contract.
I'm tied up until Jan. '43.
Predated contracts
which arrived just in time!
That's all right. Eat! Drink!
I choose good subjects,
I don't make films in Germany.
I leave our propaganda to the French.
Vichy censorship can't touch us
and I pay the best.
- What more do you want?
- I don't know.
Isn't it a bit too salty?
Salt always hides something.
Ever since the Middle Ages.
Forget the Middle Ages, Aurenche.
It's salted just right.
Hire Prevert.
Hire Jeanson, Very, Laroche...
Jeanson was denounced by the French.
And the others tell me, "Hire Aurenche."
Spaak!
Hello, Dr. Greven.
Tell him to work for me, Spaak.
Tell him I'm no ogre.
Odette Joyeux is raving
about Love Letters.
Thanks. How about you?
I have my ups and downs.
He's not afraid to work for me.
He's finishing a film
and he's signed to do
a Simenon, a Maigret.
Give him my two films then.
He doesn't have that French light touch.
You have it. I want to make
lots of good films.
Better than the Americans.
So I need good scripts,
- Hence, good scriptwriters.
- Take your pick.
There's nothing to pick.
And you know why?
No more Jews. Not in Germany,
not here. The best writers
were Jews. Natanson, Andre Lang,
Pierre Wolff. All gone!
If you know any, send them over.
Mr. Greven,
even if I knew any, think I'd tell you?
Know what you risk
talking to me like that?
I could send you to Germany tomorrow.
Sure... If I were a laborer
or maitre d', I'd answer differently.
But we're 2 bourgeois. I'm poorer,
but still a bourgeois.
We're two of a kind.
I have a Jew at Continental.
And communist, too.
I know it. He doesn't know I know.
Just one film, Aurenche. A comedy.
You know how to write gags.
I'll have Fernandel in 3 months.
He'll direct.
It's called Adrien.
A Jean de Letraz hit.
But those kind of plays...
Just what I loathe.
As for Fernandel...
He's a gag factory, a walking gag.
Where would I fit in? I'd ruin it all.
Rene!
Rene Wheeler!
Selling shoelaces?
Not by choice. I have to eat.
I don't sell any so I don't eat.
I just turned down a film.
A piece of crap.
I can accept it for you.
You write and collect.
There are bad points.
Director and star: Fernandel.
For Continental, the Fritz.
Eat with the devil, at least you eat.
Is that cop here to monitor the gags?
I've had this idea
I wanted to do with you.
A story about river poachers.
A totally free narrative.
- Shot entirely on location.
- Which region?
The Rhone. Simple people.
Anarchists, extravagant as we like them.
Well, Aurenche!
I'm not fickle, but when I left...
You know what Napoleon said?
Rene Wheeler, a first-class writer.
Take him and we'll be a team.
What did our friend Napoleon say?
It'll come back to me.
Rene's free as of now...
He knows it's Fernandel in front
and behind the camera.
Fernandel's ideas, gags, the works.
He talks so I'll say yes
without thinking.
But still, I'm thinking.
And I say yes anyway.
Go up and see Marcel Bryau,
who's in charge of contracts.
Don't go. I'll see you in a minute.
"Patience and time
accomplish more than force and rage."
That's it.
Have a good day.
Come along.
So it's Fernandel.
Your timing of the Tourneur film
was perfect!
Only a 17-second difference
with the final cut.
Do the same on Ladies' Delight.
You'll work with Cayatte.
The Military Cross?
And the stars are citations?
You were an officer?
Cavalry lieutenant, transferred
to a reconnaissance group.
But what happened to you French?
This whole debacle!
In '14 you held firm.
I fought you, you had courage!
But now, why this beating? Why so fast?
Fine. I have one, too.
I was a fighter pilot.
Power shortage.
Take 2 extra nights.
Cayatte lacks experience. You have it.
Show him where the camera goes.
It's freezing!
The young lady there...
That's a projector, not a foot-warmer.
Put a scrim on that projector.
The two girls on the left...
The lady in the brown coat,
move to the left. The other lady, too.
My left.
Not your left.
You're holding me up.
I'm going to work.
- Ausweiss, please!
- What ausweiss?
Your pass.
You have my ID. My papers are in order.
Tell them!
It's curfew. You need ausweiss.
I'm an extra! Over there.
Ladies' Delight! Extra!
Me, movies, Continental, studio!
Continental is you! It's German!
- Tract!
- That's nothing...
I found it on the ground!
I'm gonna make a stink!
I know the director!
And I work for you!
Continental is German, it's you!
I'm cold and hungry!
I have fish bone paste.
They're coming!
- Butts!
- What a waste!
Quiet on the set!
Ready, everybody?
Ready, Michel?
Let's do it.
- A chair?
- No, thank you.
Do you need anything?
Ladies' Delight. Scene 248, take 1!
Action!
Take your money back.
Baudu doesn't accept charity.
You ruined me,
but you won't last. You've created
a mastrous monchine... Shit!
Cut!
"A monstrous machine"!
This was written by a mindless midget.
- Stay in your places.
- I'm in my place!
- It's okay, Michel.
- Bug off!
Silence!
Hammers!
Maybe there's no director!
Watch your manners!
- Water for Mr. Simon.
- Which take?
- Sixth.
- Bad times in Billancourt!
In 20 years, trade will be
one big battlefield,
on which quality,
probity and confidence
will be sacrificed. Beware, Mouret!
You're inaugurating a reign
of junk and razzle-dazzle.
There's a price that you, too...
that you too, one day...
What? "You, too, one day..." What!
I can't do it!
I can't go on playing
with watchdogs around.
Take a 3-minute break.
Reload!
Michel's a pain, but what balls!
Swiss balls! Safer than Gallic ones.
Neutral balls!
It's going to be hell!
Machine guns and anti-aircraft guns.
We'll go nuts!
- Go to my godmother.
- They won't shoot all day.
Where'd you get this?
The dairywoman.
I hired her daughter as an extra.
Can the baby eat it?
Sure, sure.
As for us... the crust is good.
Your brother gets my goat.
He only comes to pick up girls.
But tonight, absent for duty.
What do you mean?
He never showed up.
I found him work as an extra.
But him...
He'll get packed off to Germany,
like my brother.
Except that he got squealed on.
It's been a while.
It's every day now.
Air raids all the time!
Your Brits are a pain!
And always the same targets
Renault, Salmson, Sauter.
So long, Billancourt!
I'm moving to Rue St. Charles.
But that's right where Citroen is!
So? They'd never bomb Citroen.
Citroen is all Jews.
- Mr. Raoul!
- This isn't bad.
More of that gutless literature.
My hat's no trash can!
Rehearsal, gentlemen!
I dare you to repeat that.
What you call my tomahawk pin
is Petain's francisque. I'm proud of it!
But you still kiss Kraut ass!
I fought them but I respect
the victors.
- "And I inform."
- What nerve!
Hands off! I'll denounce you!
Mr. Aimable!
You're behind on the set construction.
Let me show you why.
Coffins?
The wood for our sets. Requisitioned.
It's in great demand
on the Russian front.
That's furniture for the Atlantic Wall.
The studio head sells to the Krauts.
No profit is too small.
To make household savings,
use everything.
Let nothing go to waste...
Mom, what're you doing here?
Simone got a summons.
- Summons?
- I came to watch the baby.
- Summoned by whom?
- How should I know?
You know Simone. She called,
showed me a paper when I got here,
- And said: "I'm going to Fresnes."
- The prison! I'm going.
You're crazy!
Try the police first.
It must be those shoe coupons.
They looked shady to me.
She got them from her father.
Those shoes were trash...
Wood and cardboard.
Let the time go by
Let the days go past
Let the wind blow high
but make sure love stands fast...
Strange place to meet.
There's safety in numbers.
You wanted to see me?
I'm worried.
Simone got a summons.
I asked the police. No news.
Who summoned her? Where?
I don't know. But she's at Fresnes.
I'll ask around.
Continental's no protection.
This proves it.
That's irrelevant.
She works at Sirius Distribution.
If we got her out...
Our job is intelligence, infiltration,
not playing commandos.
