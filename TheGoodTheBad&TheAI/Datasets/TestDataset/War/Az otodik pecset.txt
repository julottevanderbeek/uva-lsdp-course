Mr. Kiraly! Who would
believe it?
It cannot be true.
Impossible, these days!
So you don't believe it?
So you don't?
Here it is!
My God that's some meat!
Really nice.
It's beautiful!
I don't remember
when I saw such a thing.
Now you see!
I traded it for a
Romanische Baukunst,
and a collector's prize:
a wonderful Bosch
I am going to have a
big dinner tonight.
So what?
Won't you die then?
What?
I said
won't you die then?
If what?
If you have a
big dinner tonight.
Philosophical mood again?
Did you do a dirty job?
We all do the job we can.
Some will have veal-breast
some chicken meat tonight,
depending what you have.
But you can get
veal-breast
only in the crookedest way
these days!
Here you are
it's on the house!
No objections, Bela,
it's bloody cold outside.
You surely know
what kind of meat this was?
Veal-breast. A most
beautiful one!
How do you know,
it wasn't human breast?
Don't be disgusting,
Mr. Auricular!
Keep your perversity
to yourself!
You won't spoil my
appetite.
I ran my legs off for it!
I bet you don't even know,
who Bosch is...
Don't worry,
I will enjoy my meat!
Veal-breast...
it's good food!
I'm beginning to forget
how to prepare it!
I might just as well
tell you how.
My wife makes it so...
that...
she takes the meat,
I mean not too...
Is that veal breast yours
or Mr. Kiraly's?
Then, will you please
let Mr. Kiraly speak?
All right,
I didn't say a word.
Please don't embarrass me,
Mr. Auricular!
But I'd gladly tell you
how to make it,
since I happen to have
a special recipe...
This doesn't mean that
the wife of our friend,
whom I respect as a
good housewife,
couldn't prepare it
even better than I...
I believe, it's not the way
you do the stuffing,
but larding is
what really counts...
Everything depends on this.
While preparing to lard it,
you must be careful
to make the ham
really crispy...
Then you can lard the
veal-breast
with the tasty, saucy
crispy ham.
and you can add
if you want to,
some very thin slices
of cheese...
I'd like to see what
a veal-breast would be!
- So you'd like to see it!
- I do!
Have you seen a roast-meat
without garlic?
Of course,
there is garlic in it!
Say! Have you or
haven't you?
Without garlic?
There's no roast-meat
without garlic!
And I bet you
there'll never be!
If you want to know
how to make it good
I should tell you
how my wife makes it...
She takes the meat
not too big a piece,
She washes it clean,
some people
even wash it twice...
Hurry up a little bit,
mister
All we need is
an air-raid warden!
I would gladly hurry...
but I can't.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to hurt you.
What would you like to have?
I don't really know
what I can ask...
Have some hot-spiced wine!
It would do you good now!
I could do with some
hot spiced wine, now.
Don't listen to
what he's saying!
Just let his remarks pass!
I don't have any
hot spiced wine
and he knows it very well.
Could I have then
half a liter of wine?
Here's your wine!
You can sit here mister
if you want to.
Come over here!
Thank you so much.
Good evening, gentlemen!
I would join your table
if you don't mind...
Please, do!
There's always some room
to swing a cat here...
Thank you again.
Let me take my overcoat off,
it's quite warm here.
Yes, do take it off.
Give it to me,
let me help you.
It's quite alright...
A cigarette, Mr. Kovacs?
Please, help yourself...
What? "Darling"? You're
really well off!
You're full of complaints
with such treasures...
I got it from the captain
this afternoon.
This brand is becoming
quite popular.
It is said to be flavored
with honey.
I don't really see why those
classy people like it...
It's almost like
sipping on perfume...
Only because they like
to show off.
Don't think that
they enjoy it.
They always want
something different!
When I was young
I worked
in Balaz's restaurant.
It must have been
long ago...
There was a villa-house
near.
A council lived in it,
some real aristocrat...
He stepped out to his
terrace every day,
and did his gymnastics
completely nude...
Nude?
Completely nude.
He must have been
some maniac
A maniac! That's good!
If I may interrupt you...
When I once visited an
aristocratic family...
What's your profession,
mister, if I may ask.
I am a Photographer.
Actually, I am an
artistic photographer.
A what?
Artistic photographer,
my name is Keszei.
Karoly Keszei.
So you're a master
if I am correct.
No! I am an
artistic photographer...
Just like in my profession.
It makes quite a difference
the way you work...
Your customers would want
something nice.
Not just something good,
but nice, too.
And I think, that's
already art.
Is that right?
Perfectly so...
You can hardly imagine,
what a great pleasure it is
when your own
more mature tastes prevails
over another person.
Because I believe,
when we have achieved
a higher perfection,
then it is our duty
to encourage the ones
lagging behind to change
their opinions...
Did you say something?
I only said: Ah-huh!
And how do you mean it?
Nevermind me, mister!
Well then, cheers!
Let's drink to the idea
that we should continue
to like what we like
and not what others do!
That's the way
I prefer it, too.
Life can have a meaning
only if we've got the right
to do what we decide...
Tastes are seldom similar,
fortunately...
It would be intolerable
if we all had the same views.
If that councilor found it
enjoyable
to dance on his balcony
in the nude, let him do so!
As long as he leaves
my business alone.
The trouble begins if
this councilor is charged
with the distribution of
ration-books.
Imagine this fellow
going down to the street,
where he'll see
a lot of people.
But he will no longer see
women, men and children...
he'll only see rations.
Like, there go two rations.
there goes another one...
Or, there's an old ration
that can soon be canceled.
That poor wretched ration
can hardly walk...
Quite a sense of humor!
It's not that very funny,
Bela!
If you think about it,
it's not very funny.
Thank you Mr. Kovacs,
surely it's not funny.
Like, here's our friend...
What did you say
your name was?
Karoly Kaszei.
Did this happen to
your leg
at the front line?
Yes, but my case
wasn't the only one.
That's exactly what I mean.
Could anyone of us live
with a clean conscience
if he had sent this man
to the front line,
saying go ahead man,
it's your duty...
Or saying: I'll take care
of everything...
And then here is
what happened...
Could you live with a
clean conscience, Bela?
No, I couldn't.
But I wouldn't say
such things!
Some people do!
They're never bothered
by bad conscience.
Thousands of people are
crippled and killed
and they just keep
sending new ones.
Won't they die then?
If what?
If they just keep
sending new ones.
Do you think
they wouldn't die?
Mr. Auricular, you are just
like the grocer's parrot,
which keeps saying
good morning, good morning.
Very good.
It's a clever parrot.
Much cleverer than some
book peddler intellectual
I mean: intellectuwal...
Why are you picking on me?
Why do you think so?
I did hear you say
"intellectuwal"
Very educated people
often pronounce it this way!
If it's correct for them
it should be good for you!
You can say "allo" on
the telephone, too
You, book-peddler
intellectewal...
I protest, Mr. Auricular,
And let me ask you
a favor...
Help me! Help!
Stop! I told you to stop!
Didn't you hear
what I said?
Can you see something?
Not a thing!
Dear Mr. Kiraly
I'd rather you didn't
insist on this now...
I am sorry.
Let me give
your money back...
What Mr. Kiraly said
is probably right,
still how could a country
exist without leadership?
Especially in war-time
like now?
It depends on the leaders
that the country's interest
should be above
everything else...
You must be kidding!
I hope you don't really
mean that any interest
would make a war
worth-while.
I don't claim to be
an educated man,
but I know,
and I can tell you,
that there's no interest
of any kind
for which it would be
worth making war!
May I ask you something?
If anybody said
for example,
let me stress it's
only a theory
that you are wrong,
what would you do then?
I wouldn't bother
arguing with him.
But if somebody told you
that you must be a fool
saying such things?
Please don't get me wrong.
I'm not saying this,
just let us suppose!
So what would you do then?
Hell, I don't know
what I would do!
It would depend on
the person, too.
Still, what would
you do?
I'd tell him that
he is wrong
because I wasn't saying
anything stupid...
You are an honest,
decent fool, Bela!
Now I see what our friend
is driving at...
Go ahead and answer him
Bela!
Tell him what you'd do if
somebody called you a fool.
And if that person would
stick to his claim!
Why would anyone say this
without any reason?
The reason is that
he doesn't
agree with you!
It means he's convinced
that you're a fool,
and he'd go around
shouting that
you are a fool!
Then I'd be forced
to beat him up
for insulting me
without reason
That's the way
wars get started.
You'd also start a fight
for a trifle,
in which you can kill
or be killed.
Excuse me, Mr. Kiraly
But I wouldn't call it
a trifle...
There's a minor factor
you've failed to consider.
The fact is that
this other man also had
some definite ideas.
He thought that his ideas
were better than yours.
And what did he do?
He was only trying
to convince you
that you represented a
wrong idea. That's all.
By calling me a fool?
He probably said that
much later...
and was probably carried
away by his emotions.
But if he's convinced
that his idea is right,
then doesn't he deserve
respect
for trying to show you
the right way?
Such a man would only want
to share the good things
with all other people...
He'd even scarify himself
to help realize a world
that he imagined.
Let's stop here
for a moment, mister!
The real trouble is
there are abnormal people
who want everybody
to believe what they want.
If you say no,
they'll break your neck.
You only need a few
crazy fellows to have trouble.
They would never believe
that other may be right.
What do you think, Bela?
Quite so!
What are you laughing at?
You could at least let us
have a discussion in peace!
Just let him laugh!
He must be thinking of his
nude angels again...
Nevermind him.
And what about Jesus?
Do you think he was also
an abnormal fellow?
If Jesus hadn't believed
strongly in his ideas...
It couldn't have happened
without strongly believing
that he had indeed
found the truth.
So what? Has the world
changed at all?
How can you say the world
hasn't changed?
What can I say?
Has there ever been soap
made of human flesh?
Mr. Kiraly! Are you crazy?
Honestly, has it never
happened before?
Though Jesus's teachings
are well known today...
I know it's not nice to
hear it
but we all know well
what I'm speaking about.
I hope you won't
get me wrong
but we should stick
to the facts...
So, has it ever happened
before now? Never!
Only because there's
a self-conceited character
who claims to be
the cleverest of all,
and who wants to tell
all mankind
how to live from now on.
Did you say something,
Mr. Auricular?
Nevermind him, he's only
trying to be funny!
How can such a man
sleep in peace
when he causes the death
of many people everyday?
Don't worry,
he sleeps very well.
Oh, no!
Did you see that film
in which that king
strangled his nephews in
fear of losing his power?
Such a man cannot live
very securely.
But they are on top,
it must be worth anything.
And what do the others get?
Just like in the army,
if a private is told
to lick the floor
then shut up private
and lick the floor!
We are a big nil,
we must obey
the big shots.
But tell me then,
Isn't it more decent
the way we live?
At least we don't
hurt anybody.
Aren't you listening,
Mr. Kovacs?
I do.
I am not a rich man,
I'm not a big shot either,
I am working alone...
I live the way I manage,
but I'm not complaining.
Please don't laugh at me.
for what I am saying,
but I've always wanted
to have a phonograph.
Do you know what
it's like?
Not as big as this,
but a small one.
If you speak into it
you can listen to
your voice.
It's quite childish,
but it's still something
I wanted so badly.
for so many years.
though it really wasn't
a big thing.
It was just a trifle, really.
Just a few kilos of wine.
But I'm still saying,
that my life with troubles
and disappointment
is still worth more than
the life of those big shots
Don't you think so,
Mr. Auricular?
You should know...
I've got no wealth
not even a bloody
phonograph
but I've got
clear conscience!
Bela, my good ol' buddy
am I right!
That's right, buddy,
that's right.
Our names won't be printed
in history books,
but we never did anything
evil, either.
Though, some day
some people might say...
Oh no! Not this again!
Air-raid warning!
Bela, dear!
What is it honey?
I'll be with you
in a minute, dear!
Shall we go to the
air-raid shelter?
No. We've only got
an old cellar.
It doesn't matter.
I've been on the front,
I've learnt a thing or two.
Well-then...this way!
The switch is
right next to the door.
It seems they're not
coming this way.
Yes seems so...
Maybe to Komarom?
Or to Miskolc.
They bombed it yesterday.
You're going to have
a good dinner tonight?
I hope so.
You haven't finished
how you do the veal
breast.
Our friends always
interrupted me...
I didn't want to argue,
but my stuffing is
really something...
That I know, too
Bread, some spices,
things like that...
if you want to do it well
listen to me and
try it this way.
Put some salami in it
but cut it first into
tiny little pieces
You must be joking!
Just do it this way
and you won't be disappointed.
Only a few people
know about this trick,
but believe me, it will
make it wonderful.
How about the garlic,
my friend?
There is garlic in it,
more than you'd believe.
It's just about over.
It must have been a
false alarm.
Air-raid warning only
for Miskoic.
Did you say more garlic
than usual?
That's a bad mistake.
Right, Mr Kovacs?
Tell me, Bela. Do you put
salami into the stuffing?
Don't be kidding!
Well, I do!
And how about it?
That's great! Why not put
some horse meat in it?
Or some brawn, or
maggoty cheese?
Not those! But I do put
some salami in it!
Have you tasted it?
Air-raid warning over!
Sorry, I can't invite you
for tonight,
but next time
I'll insist...
Mr. Auricular!
For God's sake,
what's the matter with you?
I am thinking whether
I should be Tomoceuszkatatiki
or Gyugyu.
I see. That's clear
as daylight.
I would stay a bit
if you don't mind...
Just in time, mister.
Can you tell me what
you'd like better
a veal breast or a
globe artichoke?
Do you know what an
artichoke is?
It is some kind of
a berry, is it?
But how can you ask
such a question?
Who would be so foolish
as to choose an artichoke?
Am I right?
Mr. Kovacs!
If somebody told you that
you're going to die,
but before that you've got
the right to choose
who you want to be
born again as.
Would you choose Gyugyu or
Tomoceuszkatatiki?
I'll explain it to you.
This Tomoceuszkatatiki is
a monarch, you see.
He rules the island of
Lucs-Lucs.
Mr. Kovacs, let me warn you
before he takes you in
that such an island
doesn't exist at all!
You'll be surprised my
intectuallewal friend
that this island
does really exist.
You can take my word,
Mr Kovacs
it has existed from time
immemoriably
and from now on
you'll also know about it.
But what have I got
to do with it?
You've got a lot to do
with Gyugyu and not
Tomoceuszkatatiki...
who is Gyugyu?
He's a slave, Mr Kovcas.
He's a simple slave
just like in the books.
Let me tell you a few
stories about him.
so that you could see
what a real slave he is...
He broke into a smile once
in his master's presence
who asked him what he
was smiling at.
The slave candidly answered:
"Something came to my mind."
"Is that so,"
said the master.
"I'll see to that
it shouldn't happen again."
And he had the slave's
tongue cut out.
cause he thought he could cut
the slaves thoughts,
by cutting out his tongue.
When his daughter was taken
away, Gyugyu wept.
She was a pretty
teenager and
was given to the
master as "a present."
How can people...
She was killed
by his master's lechery
and finding this out
Gyugyu, became embittered...
Two years later his son
was also taken away
and was given to an old
voluptuous lord.
Gyugyu was thrown into even
more agony.
It's disgusting
even to listen to this!
Aren't your virgins enough?
You need young kids, too?
These are really terrible
things Mr. Auricular!
I'm only telling you
the facts.
But to make his bitterness
even more justified
the nose of his wife was
cut off for clumsiness
and then one if his eyes
was put out because
he stepped on the tail
of his master's pet monkey.
The bastards! The son's
of bitches!
Wretched, poor man!
How could he bear
so much misery?
He had a theory,
Mr. Kovacs.
He consoled himself
by repeating every evening
"I am a wretched slave
they can torment me,
they can humiliate me,
they can put out my eyes,
they can take my kids away,
they can kill my wife...
my life is still the best,
because I'm not committing
any such terrible crimes..."
He also said:
"I am one of those who are
deprived of everything,
but my conscience
is clear,
and that's what counts
most."
The slave consoled himself
with these thoughts,
and surprisingly
he really became consoled.
I guess I understand it,
Mr. Auricular
And what happened to
that brute?
Nothing.
He was perfectly sure
that he was the best
monarch in the world.
What? How could he have
a clean conscience,
after committing such
terrible crimes?
He did worse things too.
Thousands of worse things...
He never had a guilty
conscience,
since he followed
the morals of his age...
He was convinced of the
justice of his deeds.
You don't really mean it!
People must know about
crimes they commit!
Why are you so shocked,
Mr. Kovacs?
How about the millions of
hungry people today?
Or those who cannot buy
a bloody phonograph?
Let's not waste time,
Mr Kovacs!
You've got five minutes
to decide if you want
to be Gyugyu or
Tomoceuszkatatiki.
How come I've got
only five minutes?
In five minutes
you are going to die,
but immediately you'll be
reborn again
either as Gyugyu or as
Tomoceuszkatatiki...
I'm checking the time.
It's a tasteless game,
Mr. Auricular!
Don't you understand what
this is about?
I do. I very much do!
But what five minutes?
Why five minutes?
Will you please put
that watch away?
It's not a simple question.
And five minutes?
It's a matter much more
important, isn't it?
Say something, you, too!
The situation is that...
...that our friend
is looking for fun!
You think so?
I am sorry
but I don't think so.
Mr. Kovacs is quite right
this is a serious matter.
We are talking about
all kinds of things here
in one way or another...
and now Mr. Auricular is
asking us the question...
What do you mean he's
asking us?
Just how do you mean it?
Did he ask you anything,
Bela?
Not a thing!
- Well, not of me either.
And let me stress this
once for all!
May I ask you something?
Can you just sit at a table
with a clear conscience
without answering
such a question?
Certainly, you can!
Do you know what a
cool head is?
Let me explain it to you.
A cool head is watching
the flies on the ceiling...
Tell me the truth,
Mr. Kovacs,
has anything like this
ever occurred to you?
Why didn't we think of
such things?
We have our own views,
and we don't need Gyugyu
or Tomoctiki
to see what is going on
in the world.
Then you already know
which one you'd choose.
What do you mean I know?
You've just said you've got
your own views and
you don't need to mediate
about such things.
So you must already know
which one you'd choose.
Come on!
Leave me alone!
Am I right, Mr. Kovacs?
Yes, certainly...
But Mr. Kiraly's protest
is also justified,
because Mr. Auricular
asked it from me.
So it is my duty
to give an answer.
Tell me Mr. Auricular,
is this Tomoceuszkatatiki
really not at all
in doubts about...
Heil!  Heil Szaiasi!
Good evening.
"...Happiness is to be
in friendly company..."
Yes, please,
what can I get you?
Have you got any
hard liquor?
Not...really...
Don't worry, our friend
we won't look just drink.
Give him a good shot.
It is enough?
I'll try it.
Thank you.
Cheers.
How about you?
No thanks
I don't want anything...
Nice place.
Are you the owner? - Yes.
Very nice.
Quite fine.
Gee! What a liquor!
You must be a sharp fellow
to get such liquor.
I beg your pardon?
Excuse me,
How much?
How much is it?
Please..let me...
Oh no!
I'll take care of it!
Thank you.
Is 17/B the next house
to the left?
Yes. This is 17/A.
Thank you for the fine
liquor.
Good night.
Heil! Heil Szalasi!
Sons of bitches!
Do you want another drink?
No, thank you.
It'll be one forty.
Did I hear him well?
Did he say 17/B?
Yes.
Dirty murderers!
Well, we might just as
well go.
Yes, we'd better
call it a day.
Cheers!
Please, Mr Auricular!
We haven't finished what
we were talking about...
Oh, not again! Don't
start it again!
I think that I could
answer your question.
Could you?
about the world's affairs,
and so my answer is:
Yes.
How do you mean that?
I would choose
Gyugyu the slave.
Your overcoat, Mr. Kiraly.
Could you have really
chosen it?
Yes. Only him.
You're lying.
I beg your pardon.
You're lying.
So, off we go, Bela.
I'm sorry, why did you
say this to me?
Because you're not telling
the truth.
It's not a big thing,
it can happen to anyone.
Shall we go, gentlemen?
Never mind him,
it's his usual style.
Please take it back
what you just said.
Are you coming,
Mr. Kovacs?
Are you also doubting
my word?
You know it's difficult...
You can't make up your
mind so soon...
Maybe you only rushed
the answer.
I didn't say that!
And you, you  don't believe
either what I chose?
What does it matter if
I believe it or not?
Isn't your own choice
more important for you?
Do you believe it or not?
Answer me straight,
answer me decently!
Listen, mister! I didn't
offend you,
so you'd better not
offend me either.
If a man is right,
he doesn't shout!
Aggressive, nervous people
like you, now,
won't make a good Gyugyu.
It's no use arguing
about silly games,
you can take my word,
mister.
Forgive me!
Oh no!
You should forgive me!
And thank you
for the good wine, boss,
and I really hope
at least one of you
would have the courage
to make up his mind
and choose
what he indeed could become.
Good night.
Shut the door!
All I need now
is an air-raid warden!
You're a damn fool,
Mr. Auricular! No insult!
I agree!
I perfectly agree!
Do you know,
what the truth is?
The truth is in this bag!
Just don't forget
to put garlic in it!
You know how much
you understand about
making a veal-breast?
You know what you can do
with your being so right?
All right! All right!
Good night, everybody.
I'll bring your watch
tomorrow.
That will be fine.
See you tomorrow.
Stop for a minute.
Mr. Auricular
Is this Timoteusz
really not aware of the crimes
he is committing?
No. He's not.
He doesn't even know what
a guilty conscience is...
Then maybe...he is not
guilty at all?
This is something
you must decide.
And when I'm reborn,
when I'm born to be
one or the other,
shall I remember that
this was my own choice?
No.
-Are you sure?
Sure.
You won't remember a thing
Mr. Kovacs.
Well, then...good night.
Greetings to your wife.
Thank you.
You played this silly game
too tough,
the poor man won't sleep
all night.
I'd believe him if he
chose Gyugyu.
You would?
-Yes, I would.
But you wouldn't believe us?
Who?
Me or Bela, for example.
You must answer this
question yourself, alone.
If you deceive yourself
Mr. Kiraly,
it means grave trouble...
Well, good bye.
Sleep well.
Young girls are not enough!
He needs young boys as well!
He's a perverted pig.
A blood bath of virgins...
That's what he'd liken
the dragon of virtue.
And he's still got the guts
to ask questions!
She mustn't find the
tenderloin in my suitcase!
She'd snatch it and eat it
with her beloved husband.
Once I should really
drop in without any bags
and just say:
"Listen, honey,
No more eggs, no more bacon,
no more meat,
no nothing at all!
And your beloved husband
can drop dead...
Your lucky break is over!"
But the bitch has
fantastic lips...
if only she didn't notice
the tenderloin!
She can take the veal, I
don't care,
but not the tenderloin!
My wife's favorite is
tenderloin...
Where have you been,
for God's sake?
If I had told them that
I chose the tyrant
they would have believed me.
But I chose the good side,
so they called me a liar.
What will become of us,
my God?
Poor, miserable mankind!
Whatever deprived them of
goodness, beauty
and grandeur?
One thousand three hundred
and sixty-seven steps...
Pretty good average.
Good evening.
Have you had your dinner yet?
Yes, we have.
How are you feeling?
I feel fine.
Nothing the matter?
I'm just a bit dizzy...
sometimes.
Did anyone see you?
This is the moment when
I must be tough...
I must tell her immediately
the tenderloin is not hers.
An entry of 50 pengo
to that hoodlum
called Kalmar,
so he would bring us
some of that fine liquor
again
that our elegant customers
liked so much today.
Take one of these pills
twice a day.
It will soothe the little
pain and fatigue that
you'll regularly feel
for three to four days.
But put it away so others
won't find it.
Were you frightened?
You though you wouldn't
make it another day?
It's not the end.
Rather the beginning.
It means you're healthy
and growing up
Life has send you the word
why you were born.
Don't let this prey
on your mind.
You know, Mr Auricular is
a strange man.
He's a good man!
Since his wife died
four years ago,
he's been rearing those
three kids alone,
but I never hear him
complain about it.
He's a very decent man.
Of course, he is,
but he's also a little
peculiar.
He likes to tease you.
He invented this story
only to tease you.
My God! This is
really not it!
Unfortunately, this is
just not it.
This can't be true!
My dear, is it mine?
Oh, my sweet darling,
a real veal breast!
What's in that other bag?
I've seen another bag, too.
Lucy dear! Please don't!
Not that one!
Tenderloin!
You've got tenderloin?
I am lost.
A hundred pengo to the
local fascist commander?
Hell, no! What is he
doing for it?
That's it! I don't want
him to do anything!
That's what the money
is for.
People of our kind can
get along nowadays
only if we drawback
quietly.
We must kiss the hands
of our local commander,
let him believe he is
a big shot.
Is that clear, honey?
If the Russians come in
you'll be hanged.
And what if the Russians
don't come?
What if these guys
stay on top?
What if the wonder weapon
happens to work out?
Those who have suffered
a lot and have faced death
they know that nothing
can save you
from evil and sin
except suffering itself.
You shall not refrain
from suffering.
for that is the way
to achieve goodness...
This is the only way to be
among the chosen ones
on Last Judgment's Day.
To be present when
the angel of
the Book of Revelation
breaks the fifth seal...
Everything that is today
will pass.
Evil is alien to man.
Alien like a sickness
that can be cured.
Whatever is happening today
you'll forget it one day.
Life shall be victorious
it can't happen the other way.
Do not be afraid.
It's getting late,
time for you to go to bed.
How restless he is...
Is he like this all day?
Yes, always.
He's waiting for a meeting.
Always waiting for someone,
but he never tells anybody
for whom...
His cover is down again.
What about them?
I sleep them together
so I could free one bed.
You're a clever girl.
I'll try to get one more
bed,
though I don't know
where I could put it.
You're a clever little
mother. Sleep well.
Good night.
I've put the books
in your workroom.
Thank you.
Put the Teddy bear
on the cover, here.
Aren't you sleeping?
No, I'm not.
Still brooding on the
same situation?
Yes.
-Why?
On the question: why there
has to be
Tomoceuszkatatikis and Gyugyus
in this world...
Otherwise, who would ever
think of them after all?
Who makes life so evil?
Isn't everything created
by man himself?
I think, I could
make a choice...
Are you serious?
-Yes, I am.
I think I could make
a choice.
because I've gone through
so much misery that
it would have been more
than enough for three...
I know your family also
lived in hardship,
but the way we lived...
I still can't understand
how we could bear it all.
Still, we carried on.
I am used to this lot
in life,
and I don't think I could
ever choose another one.
Isn't this the way
you see it, too?
We'll open a new account
of 50 pengo for Mrs. Szabo.
No way, buddy, no way!
Who is Mrs. Szabo?
Is she a policewoman,
or some local commander?
She's a widow, my dear.
A widow?
Her husband was taken away.
He was carried away legally
and politely, tonight.
How do you know it?
I saw the hangman
with the rope.
This 50 pengo may be useful
for use one day only.
If the Russians come in
Mrs. Szabo will be alright.
And I will have helped
the family of the communists.
We must be prepared for
any situation.
I am not a fool to
become Gyugyu
I won't let Tikitakis
do anything with me!
In old times,
when you died for a belief
...for truth
you could face death
in front of the people,
bound to a stake,
surrounded by a crowd.
They kept their eyes on you
until the glorious
extinction of yourself
They could see the flames
reaching your body,
they could hear you cry out:
I am dying for you!
And today?
I still believe,
the duty of the devoted is
to accept all suffering.
Good evening.
Don't be afraid
nobody saw us.
I am uncle Miklos
what is your name?
Anni.
There's a beautiful Teddy-
bear waiting for you...
He's got a huge piece of
chocolate for you!
You'll be staying here
until your mummy and daddy
come back.
My mom and dad are never
going to come back.
Where did you get this
idea?
I saw them shot dead.
When I grow up. I'll be
shot too.
So, I'm ever glad I'm not
grown up, yet.
Here's your little handbag.
Good night.
Let's see the Teddy bear,
and your chocolate.
We must survive, honey!
We must stay alive,
the way we can...
It's a rotten, miserable
world.
We're forced to maneuverer
as if we committed some crime...
I must do this or I'm going
to die...
What else can I do? Break my
own neck?
No way!
I prefer to live.
I want to live!
I want to live with you!
Come over here!
Come, you naughty little
thing!
Come to your Tomotiki!
To hell, with Gyugyu!
We've got the brain
we need!
Why am I so Goddamn stupid?
Why do I magnify
everything?
Ever since I can remember
made centuries ago
without anybody bothering
to ask my opinion.
Is that right?
Lucy, where are you?
Oh, my God!
What is happiness?
To have the courage to
do what we want!
Anything we want.
This is what makes
you free...
Why must I endure
the torments of hell
because I love to be
with a woman?
And because I can't take
home
one kilo of meat?
My wife doesn't even know
that there's ever been
any meat...
Where have you been
for God's sake?
I haven't slept all night.
Look at yourself.
See how you look?
Oh, Timoteusztikis
undisturbed happiness!
Lucy, where are you?
Where are you, bitch?
You bitch?
How long do you want
me to wait?
Why did you keep me
waiting so long?
My nice little whore!
My dear whore, you!
My god! What's the matter
with you today?
Shall I cut your throat?
Or rip your belly open?
Do you want me to drink
your blood?
Yes, I do.
My dear little Gyugyu!
You were born to be killed.
My dear bloody bitch!
My disgusting, dear
wonderful bitch!
Ilonka!
I cannot bring myself
to do it.
To choose Gyugyu.
Is this why you woke me up?
I am not the man I thought
I was.
I've been preaching about
righteousness and honor...
and now I've come to realize
that if I have a choice
I don't want to be a slave.
Would you rather be
a blood thirsty brute?
But he's not guilty!
He doesn't feel guilty.
And he's living a good life,
not like a slave
Can you imagine
what a pleasant life
you would have with me?
The answer is obviously:
Timonkinkoish
My honorable watchmaker
friend,
you were perfectly aware
that we all know very well
what the honest answer is
to your sinister question.
Only we were wondering
how this miserable
cockeyed world would react...
My honorable friend,
the credible answer is
the one you had in mind
when you invented your
stupid little tale.
The truth is what you
had in mind.
Everything else is
hypocrisy
cheating or just a lie...
Just like this whore who is
nothing more...
They all want to be
Tomoketiscki's
including myself, too...
To hell with Gyugyu
Who would be so stupid...
Damn it!
For God's sake, where
have you been again?
Hello dear,
are you still awake?
God bless you, people!
What is this, Bela?
Saving your firewood?
Do you grudge us
with your firewood?
I'll take it back!
It's getting warmer...
Can your machine play
anything else?
Why do you ask?
I've never heard it play
anything else...
What the heck?
So the master has already
brought back the watch?
It's a nice watch!
He's a bunglar, but now
he did a good job.
Don't take it for granted!
Only because it's working
doesn't mean a thing.
He may have stolen the bits
that are worth something...
Have you ever met
an honest watchmaker?
Mr. Auricular!
Why do you tolerate this?
Why not?  Won't he die then?
At last! Here we go again!
He's starting it all again!
Let's make it clear:
Who will die and when?
You! The moment I've had
enough of you!
Say, mister!
Do you need to make a
nuisance of yourself?
I do.
Has there ever been anything
you didn't scorn?
Not really. But what can
I do about it?
He's in bad spirits again.
He must have had bad luck
last night.
He seems to have quarreled
with his bread and butter...
Could you sleep last night
Mr Kiraly?
Why couldn't I have
slept well?
Couldn't you sleep?
I was meditating about
Mr. Auricular question...
My God!
This good soul will ascent
straight to heaven!
He'll be carried by angels
to heaven!
And what was your
conclusion?
I didn't come much
to an conclusion.
But the question
Mr. Auricular asked
may not have been
a proper question.
To live the life of a slave
is not the only righteous
way of life to live.
You can lead a dishonest life
not only the way
that the only man did...
Wasn't this your
conclusion too?
Don't play jokes on me!
I asked it seriously.
It was a silly game!
What do you take me for?
Do you really think that
I have nothing better to do
than think about such
stupidity at night?
After a dinner of veal?
That's right
- How much was it?
I traded it for a Bosch and
a Romanische Baukunst
I mean how much did it
get in weight?
About a kilo and a half
That's a nice piece already
But say...did you really put
salami into it?
Listen, Bela,
Why don't you pick on
somebody else?
I did put salami in it!
I went right home,
and my wife was pleased
with the way I did it.
I didn't meditate about
such stupid things!
I didn't start to
contemplate my naval...
Some appetizing smell
from the kitchen, is what
I like.
You're right.
That's the best thing.
I don't understand you.
Weren't you bothered by
this question at all?
You should be exhibited
in a museum!
You know what I did?
I checked my account-book
and then went to bed.
I don't have time for
such games...
Well, I am surprised...
Why don't we drop this
subject?
How is Mrs. Sari and
her husband?
My God! What a good bitch
she was!
This story always makes me
sick!
And why does it make you
sick?
A decent marriage makes
you sick?
With church, a wedding and
a best man?
It's disgusting!
You're overshooting the
mark again!
The old man got himself
a pretty chick
and the lady will get
a fortune when he dies.
It's good business, both
parties get a good deal.
What else should the old
man do with his money?
Should he go to Monte
Carlo?
Or carry his money with
him into his grave?
These fellows are back
again!
Stay where you are!
I told you not to move!
I am sorry.
That's what I like,
quiet, solemn place
soft music...
Nice atmosphere.
Good evening!
May I...
-Shut up!
Father Christmas has
arrived!
We've got a deal for you,
which means that you're
going to leave this place
and come with us
for a little ride.
Understand?
What is this...?
You could at least
tell us...
I've told you to shut up!
Is it clear now?
Do you want another
explanation?
Get out! Go!
No overcoat!
Who did they say
they were?
It's a trifling story
petty people.
Yes, a bar-keeper,
a watchmaker...
The other two.
- A joiner and a peddler.
What peddler?
- A book peddler.
Have you started it?
-We're just about...
Go ahead with it!
Thank you.
Macak!
Bring here one of them!
Good evening.
Come here, boy!
I told you to come here!
Come on man.
Can't you speak, boy?
Please...
- What?
My name is Janos Kovacs
I am a joiner...
I've got a family.
I am quite certain...
it must be some
misunderstanding...
Would you please check
who should have been
brought here instead
of us?
Where?
Well...here.
What here?
I mean here. Please...
I asked you what here?
You see what a mistake
your ignorance can be?
We'll take care of it!
Let's take such a
misunderstanding first.
What did you say
you are, boy?
I am a joiner...
I am a joiner with
a proper trade license.
What an obsession!
If you are an honorable
master joiner,
than your wife should be
an honorable housewife
and not a dirty whore,
which is what she is.
You son of a bitch!
No reason to get jumpy!
You see you must pay
for knowledge.
You should know that
if a criminal like you
whose wife is a dirty
whore
who has worked all the
streets of the city...
so if such a bastard
like you
call people honorable
names such as murderers,
then these people will
obviously protest
and will let you know it
in a very direct way,
like we did now.
Not bad, not bad,
but not the best either.
Let me make a few comments,
may I?
This is not the last time
you'll hear me say this:
there's a mistake in
your approach.
You just said it was
a trifling matter.
Can you explain why you
believe it's a trifle?
Well, isn't it?
- You tell me why!
Two of our people were
shot dead yesterday.
Our party headquarters
was bombed two weeks ago.
Two youngsters were
captured with leaflets...
These are not trifles.
But when four people call
us murderers
while drinking in a bar
and then go home in peace
to sleep with their wife
they are people with
a big mouth
who never do a thing.
Such case is a trifle.
These fellows have never
seen a gun.
We won't need to tie them
up before execution.
You want to execute them?
- Certainly!
Then why beat them up?
What do you mean why?
What should I do with them?
How old are you?
Twenty-eight
An arts student?
Have you read Huizinga?
And Ortega?
The "Revolt of the Masses"?
Yes, of course.
Then why do you order
the beatings?
Why?
- Yes, why?
Have you thought about it?
By right of the power
we seized.
Through the passion of
my beliefs.
Is that all?
Isn't it enough?
Let me correct one of
your mistakes, first.
Leave us alone!
The attack against
the party headquarters
and the slogans of the
walls are trifles.
Our people are shot
it's a trifle, why?
Because we capture them!
We'll hang them or
shoot them in the head.
How many are they?
A small fraction of the
population.
A few thousand? They'll
all,
become nice corpses.
So they're trifles.
But the rest of them are not!
Those who don't throw
bomb, who never shoot,
must be taken very
seriously.
Those who are living here,
breathing here
must be our main target.
This is the age of the
disgusting masses.
The mobs never cherished
more illusions about
themselves and their roles
than today.
It is sickening and
nauseating,
what the masses thing of
themselves today!
Strikes and demonstrations!
What world is this?
That's why we are
not going
to execute these ones.
Then why were they
brought here?
Do you know, my
young professor
what these people think
of themselves and the world?
I don't know
- Let me tell you, then.
They say: "We are pretty
little nobodies
we have no say in
the matters of the world.
We can only watch the storm
of history blow over,
we are at the mercy of
these people,
they can do whatever they
want with us.
That is why they were
brought here.
So that you could
bring it home to them.
So that this Macak should
break their noses,
twist their arms,
beat them up and
kick them in the groin!
So that he should call
their wives whores.
They must learn that you
have right
to break their nose,
beat them up
or kick their kidney
into pieces.
That is why you order
the beatings.
They should learn: you have
all the rights.
That is why you will
send them home
and not kill them.
Let them spread the news of
what happened here.
And they need not know
what their crime was.
No need to tell them what
the photographer said.
Don't even mention it
at all.
Let them live in
uncertainty.
Let both the guilty and the
innocent live in fear!
Making dead bodies is an
easy job, professor!
But the dead which goes on
eating and drinking,
which keeps his mouth shut
like a clam,
is a lot more difficult job,
professor!
But that's our real job!
So you should beat them up
not out of some temper,
but directed by educational
motives.
It's clear what I've said?
Yes, it is.
I'm glad we agree.
So you're going to send
these four people home
in the morning when others
can also see them.
Until then, you can teach
them a lesson or two.
But call me before you
let them go home.
Why?
Are you sure you did
understand everything I said?
Yes!
Think about it again.
Follow the logic that
I explained to you.
Isn't there something
missing in it?
What are you hinting at?
Those fellows will go home
they'll be scared of us,
they'll hate us,
which is all very well.
But what will they think
of themselves?
Can you answer it?
I think they'll be glad
to go home from here.
Your imagination is
quite slow, my boy.
Don't you think they'll
have some self-respect
for raising a fist
when you called their
wives whores?
Aren't you concerned
about this?
Only people with some
self-respect
can start a protest or a
revolt.
Would you let people go
home knowing
that they'll hate us,
but keep their self-respect
too?
Would you really make such
a grave mistake?
As long as they have any
pride,
there's no use making them
scared by any beatings.
So what shall be your
duty, my professor?
You must make them hate
themselves!
Otherwise you haven't
accomplished a thing!
Nothing at all!
Here's what the principles
of your approach should be
First:
people desperately
hold onto their lives,
Two:
people are extremely
weak,
absolutely worthless,
cowardly creatures.
Isn't that coat too
uncomfortable for you?
Try to remember
Mr. Kovacs,
whether they told you
anything
that would give us a hint
why we were brought here.
They said
that my wife was a whore...
a no-good dirty whore...
My wife!
Mr. Auricular
It's impossible
to live in this world!
Murderers, sons of bitches!
Open the door!
Let me out of here!
How are you, Bela?
How is your head?
I'm stiff all over...
And you, you clumsy
watchmaker?
Do you fear for your
shitty life?
I've got only one...
Why don't you sit up,
it might help.
Forget it!
You better send the
peddler
away from the door.
Are you waiting for
the Saviour or the next tram?
Get away from there.
They might not let us out
at all.
We're all going to kick up
on our toes here, Laci!
Are you sure?
Just as sure as
there's no need for salami
in a roast-veal.
There may be one thing
you can try.
What?
Tell them you don't know
why you are here,
but you repent everything.
Promise to be a good guy!
They might let you out
then...
Are you kidding?
I am not good at jokes.
Take a chance!
It may work out...
though I'm not sure...
What do you think about it?
It's worth a try, maybe...
Maybe...I've got noting
to lose!
Nothing to lose!
Are you serious?
This is not the way you
imagined it, was it?
What?
The way you finish your
life...
This is not over yet.
Like hell, not.
A few days before your
wife died...
forgive me for telling you
this now
she came to our house and
asked my wife for some
recipe.
She stepped in with
her round figure
and I told her,
Piroska, I bet you'll
have a boy
She said I hope it will
be a boy,
What will it's name be
I asked her...
"Named after the father,"
I asked.
"Yes," she said.
But you already have a son
named Miklos.
She said:
"I'd like to name all my
children after him..."
and she blushed like
a child.
Let me ask you something,
you don't have to answer.
Are you listening?
Do you know why we were
brought here?
No, I don't
Are you sure?
Why should I know?
Forgive me for saying this
I always thought you
had something to hide.
I mean, something descent
to hide.
You're wrong.
I was thinking about these
bastards, and I figured
if they had any brain
they would let us out.
They have flattened us
out already.
I would hurry to the
counter to serve them!
I would crawl to them and
kiss his ass,
for anything in the bar.
If they butcher us,
they'll lose
a lot of investment.
Why beat the hell out
of us
if they want to kill us?
What kind of business
would that be?
Do you remember? If you're
told
to lick the floor, shut up
and do it...
Do you think if I try it
they might let me go?
You can take a chance...
Anything can happen...
It seems,
this fellow failed to
repent...
It is justified to do
anything for your life.
It would be a sin not to
do so.
To do anything for it!
How are you, boys?
Did you call each other
bastards?
Would it be possible
for me to...
Shut up!
What's up?
Don't mosey along!
How are you champion?
You seem much quieter.
You'll get a Christmas present
from Jesus himself!
Here's your Father
Christmas!
Are you still breathing,
my boy?
Look, what daddy has
brought you!
You can go ahead and
admire him!
Stand in a row facing him,
like nice kids are
suppose to...
Stand there, in front of
him!
Look up!
Why are you shouting?
They are reasonable people
who will need your words.
Good morning.
Good morning.
You've been staying out a
little later
than decent people do
so it's time to go home.
I can't establish beyond
a doubt
if you were brought here
with or without reason.
If it was unjustified,
consider it a mistake
and forget it!
I am aware that your
dignity
may have been hurt...
but what else could we do
in such a situation?
I must express my apologies
to you
provided that you are
indeed
citizens of perfect morals
and good intentions who
only wish to live in peace.
Is that right?
Yes, it is.
I admit that we didn't
quite agree about your fate.
My comrade thought
you should be executed here.
I managed to make him
change his mind arguing
that you all claim to be
the victims of some
misunderstanding.
I suggested that we should
give you a chance
to prove your loyalty
and alliance with the state.
So we've brought this
half-dead creature here,
who has a maximum few
hours left, as you see.
This miserable creature
was an iron-founder
who blew up one of our
ammunition depots.
He called us dirty
bastards and
the suppressors of liberty
the descendants of Nero...
He also called us traitors
and many other names.
We couldn't convince him
that he was wrong.
So, I suggested that
we shouldn't rush your
execution here but
we'd rather give you
a chance
to express your scorn at
this social misfit,
and then you can go home
in peace.
What I mean exactly is
that
you should step to this
disgusting creature
and slap him twice
in the face.
Unfortunately, your
hands
will be stained with blood,
but you can wash it
at home
with some warm water, so
there'll be no trace of
blood on your skin.
Whichever of you wants to
go first, go ahead!
Take your turn.
The devil, you!
The first tram is soon
due to start...
Oh, my God, help me!
What should happen
if they don't want to
prove their loyalty?
They will. It's obvious.
You won't be able to
execute them so easily!
Start it, one of you!
Jesus, my Jesus!
Go ahead!
Get over it!
Jesus, have mercy upon me!
God, help me!
Jesus, help me
Get him up and
take him away.
Oh, my God!
I don't want to...
Do you want to go home?
Go ahead, whose turn?
Leave me alone!
Let me go!
I can't, I don't
want to...
Well then, we
must go back
to the basement!
No!
You stay here,
Mr. Kiraly.
Let me go.
You stay here!
Damn butchers!
Watch out, Macak!
Damn, rotten murderers!
OK that's it. Kill them.
No need for education!
Wait!
I see, at least one of you
is a decent man.
Go ahead.
Don't be afraid, it'll
be over and the door is open!
Mr. Auricular!
Don't do it! Don't!
You mustn't do it!
Away with that idiot.
Congratulations.
That was one.
One more and the show
will be over.
Don't waste your time!
You're a fine man.
You deserve to be free.
Macak, open the door.
This way, my friend.
Always the shortest way!
Are you crazy?
Put your hands down.
Walk straight!
What?
Put your hands down.
Do you want to go back?
Then get out of here.
Yes.
