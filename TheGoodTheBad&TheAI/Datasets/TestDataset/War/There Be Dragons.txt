The army has recruited the Spanish
colonial army of Morocco.
This is an announcement
from your government.
-
-
One, two. One, two. One, two.
Surrender.
-  Ready.
- Surrender.
Aim. Firel

I was a war baby.
in any of the 165 wars
that have occurred in my lifetime.
everyone in Spain had
to take sides and take up arms.
but the consequences
lasted the rest of his life.
until I was asked to write a book
about a dead priest-
And that's how I went looking for a saint
and found my father instead.
Josemaría!
It's the Father. Quick!
Quick! Get the doctor!
In June of 1976...
the nun was at the point of death...
diagnosed with a multiple
calcific lipomatosis tumor, causing pain...
attaining a mass the size of an orange
on the left shoulder.
Cured in a sudden and lasting way...
after the Servant of God,
Josemaría Escrivá...
had been invoked.
-
-
You have reached Judge Manolo Torres.
- Leave a message.
-
and, you know, I-I want
to talk to you about him.
And why this interest in Escrivá?
The uproar in the press about his possible
canonization turned my publisher on.
You know, and curiously, he-
he came from the same town as my father.
Ah, yes, of course.
How is the judge, Roberto?
To be honest, l-
We haven't spoken in...
eight years.
So I moved to London permanently,
and since then-
Well, he's not very forgiving,
my father.
Eight years, huh?
- Children?
- No.
I don't quite see myself as a father.
Your father is a product of difficult times.
You should try to understand him.
Well, I do, Monsignor. I do.
God bless you in your quest.
- And give my regards to, uh-
- To Leila.
Leila.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
-  Are you sure?
- Yes.
That's Josemaría Escrivá in the middle.
And that's me on the right.
And on the left, your father.
Here's another one. At the seminary.
-
-
Hello.
Dad. I'm in Madrid.
Been a long time.
Listen. I'm close to the apartment,
and I wanted to come see you.
Why would you write a book about him?
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Leave it alone, Roberto.
Well, I found out that you were
in the seminary with him...
and you never told me
that you wanted to be a priest.
- Don't you think that's weird?
- Yes, I thought so too.
That's why I left after a year, Roberto.
Why? Was it because of the civil war?
-
-
Hello. London University.
Dr. Leila Azoulay, please.
Mathematical Physics.
Good timing.
I was just about to call you.
I love Spain.
I love Spain.
He doesn't want me to do
this Josemaría Escrivá thing.
At least you two spoke. That's progress, no?
He knows something about Josemaría, damn it.
I know he does. Why can't he just tell me?
I could wrangle the weekend away.
Want me to come out?
Gun.
No!
Damn it.
I was nine
when Josemaría's path crossed mine.
Roberto, you've often told me
that I was a terrible father.
What I've never told you
is that I agree with you.
- Manolo! Manolo!
- There's so much I haven't
told you that you need to know.
- So if you want to hear about the past...
- Manolo!
- I'll tell you.
- Manolo!
- But I warn you, there be dragons.
- Manolo! Manolo!
Are you okay? Manolo!
- Manolo!
-
You got me.
- I got you, Josemaría.
- I was a little terror like most boys.
- I'm gonna get you.
- Josemaría was no saint either.
Good driving, boy. Come on!
Feels like a Taurus, Manolo.
Faster!
Stop!
- Manolo, are you all right?
- Are you mad?
Josemaría, I'll speak to your father.
He should give you a beating.
I've half a mind to sell up
and go back to Madrid, I promise.
- Can I drive again, Papa?
- No, Manolo. Enough.
Here is the first one.
See?
There are many kinds of dragons
you will have to face.
She scares me.
Don't be scared, Manolo.
How many dragons are there, Abileyza?
Many, Josemaría.
But what matters is how you face them,
as you shall see.
Josemaría's nanny talked about dragons...
A quarter of a century passed
before I realized she was right.
Why?
No!
No!
My baby! Why?
Josemaría lost three sisters.
Mama?
Do you hate God now?
No, dearest.
I... love him very much.
Will you hate him when he takes me away?
Come here.
I'm sorry about your sister.
Josemaría's father owned a chocolate factory.
We know we like what's here.
We know that we want what's here.
But what is here exactly?
Just sit this on your tongue...
for five seconds.
Hmm? Now, chew...
three times.
Manolo, you taste what?
Almond.
Almond?
Cinnamon.
Cinnamon?
Don't scoff.
Yes. Cinnamon.
All right, off you go.
Josemaría, you stay here.
I scolded Manolo for mocking
what he can't experience...
not because he couldn't experience it.
Ah, now, look at this.
Ugly, isn't it?
Just a poor, ordinary little bean.
Yet, patience...
skill, hard work and love...
can unleash the divine flavors
hidden within.
There.
Do you understand the lesson?
But not everyone has a taste
for the divine, you know.
And why is that, I wonder?
Manolo!
Manolo! Wait for me!
Stop! Manolo!
My favorite trick in those days...
But then his dad went bankrupt
and lost the chocolate factory.
And I wasn't allowed to play
with Josemaría anymore.
- He said that Josemaría wasn't one of us.
-  One!
-
- Two!
- And my dad could be quite persuasive.
- Three!
Hmm. I'm sure he didn't see us.
Around that time, Josemaría changed.
Josemaría saw footprints
in the snow outside his house.
-  You are incorrigible.
-
Do you know what you're taking on, Son?
Yes, Papa.
No one to love.
Human love, I mean.
No family of your own.
- No sons.
- I know, papi.
And... is this the wisest time
to become a priest?
Probably not.
Is your father still selling
underpants, Josemaría?
Backstabber.
Hey, careerist.
-  Fight! Fight!
-  You vain little pig!
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
What lesson do you draw from this?
To control my temper.
Bravo.
Torres, what did you call Seminarian Escrivá?
A vain little... pig.
And you- what did you call Torres?
A backstabbing careerist.
Sorry, Monsignor. I can't stand his type.
A backstabbing careerist.
That sums him up, eh?
What, his father is rich, so he thinks
he can act like a pain in the ass?
That's not the summing up
I had in mind, Escrivá.
Yet, isn't someone else his Father?
And yours?
Remember, the withholding of forgiveness...
is the one thing, as our Lord made clear...
that will not be forgiven.
So...
do you think that two hotheads,
a hypocrite and a loser...
can be good priests?
Well, I think it's possible.
I really do.
Well, he was wrong about me.
No, no, no, no! Get away!
-
- Your job is to clear this scum away...
- and let my factory get back to work.
- What can we do?
That's your job! Scum!
- Go!
- But they're just trying
to feed their families, Papa.
- What?
- The workers.
Scum!
Scum!
Manolo, when push comes to shove...
a man has only one duty...
and that is to choose the winning side.
Eh?
- Come on.
-
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Good to see you.
- You too.
-
- Nice car.
Where did you get all this?
There's more at the hotel.
- He actually sent this stuff to you?
- Yeah.
What's the reason for the change?
I don't know.
I'm almost scared to find out.
God, such a different world.
Josemaría wrote to me
once a year until he died.
I never wrote back,
but he kept writing anyway.
In his letters he told me
the turns his life was taking.
Honorio.
Josemaría.
Oh, look at you.
Give me your hand.
How's my old employer?
Papa died four years ago, Honorio.
Ah.
I said my first Mass for him.
Do you- you remember...
The chocolate bean?
Of course.
It was a great lesson.
I'm sorry. That won't work.
Why not?
Because...
I'm Jewish.
You know, the love of my life is Jewish.
Once I thought of conversion...
but I couldn't dishonor my father.
Honoring our parents is the sweetest precept
of all, Honorio, and very dear to God.
- But Jesus Christ-
- Then he won't turn his back on me...
when I stand before him, will he?
What I know for sure is that...
he loves you very much.
Thank you.
I was afraid of dying here alone.
Please pray with me, Father.
-
- And you shall love the Lord your God...
with all your heart...
and with all your mind...
and with all your soul.
Our Father...
who art in heaven...
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on earth...
as it is in heaven.
Good night, Father.
-  Lord, open my eyes.
-
I am such a blind donkey.
For so long I have felt you
guiding me, but to what?
Do you have a purpose
for your donkey, Lord...
but I'm too blind to see it?
You were there tonight, Lord.
I felt you there.
Please be with me now.
Please show me.
Ah, now, look at this.
Yes.
Yes, I see.
Everyone and everything.
Everyone and everything.
Everyone and everything...
for your glory.
Your arms open to all.
One by one.
- Thank you, Lord.
-
So this group of red-blooded
young men are prepared...
to offer themselves completely to God...
in, uh, apostolic work, including celibacy?
Yes, Vicar.
That was the choice I gave them
and one they accepted.
- Really?
- Yes.
How many?
Uh...
three.
Three.
My worry
is that this calling may be delusional.
And this work is to include women?
Yes, Your Excellency.
They will live separately,
but our work will include them...
and will also be open to married people.
Living in the same institution?
It's not an institution or a movement.
It's just a family of individuals.
And no, married couples will live at home.
It all seems rather...
Protestant-
that God is to be found in the...
well, vanities of daily life.
Hmm?
Outside holy orders.
No vows. Hmm?
No... habits.
Well, Jesus spent most
of his life working in a shop...
in Nazareth.
God's world is so full of, uh-
God's world is so full of goodness.
If we do them for love,
each daily task can give him glory.
Small but regular acts of love
between husbands and wives...
between friends, between strangers...
each revealing the beauty of his creation.
And you want to open
a new residence in Valencia, huh?
Yes. And one day in New York, Paris...
London and-and... Tokyo.
It's a long way to Tokyo.
And, uh...
no money yet to speak of.
Well, I can't provide any.
No, I didn't come to ask for that.
I ask merely for your permission-
for me and for the work.
And you shall have them.
Father Escrivá...
I offer you a job as my secretary.
In time this will lead to a career...
that might grant you the influence
that you would need...
to realize this- this dream of yours.
So, what do you say?
I said no, thank you.
Santi.
Now, it won't be easy, I know.
But I'll always see that there's a roof
over your heads and food on the table.
No? Huh?
- Josemaría-
- Actually...
I have an idea.
Pecunia in arboribus non crescit.
- Pecunia.
- I can't do it, sir.
-
- Yes, you can. Shh, shh. Yes, you can.
You will learn, and I will learn to teach it.
Oh, no. Damn it!
Stay here.
-
-
I'm sorry, Father.
Sorry. But I can't-
The smell. I can't.
-
-
How's your Latin?
Go.
No.
Go on. Go.
- Go, go, go. Go.
-
-
-
-
-  Union scum.
Drive through them!
Don't. Thugs.
How can you do this?
You know my father's ill.
Then God is just.
-
-
Damn unions.
I've always said they're going to kill him.
It's a stroke. The doctor just left.
No. No.
Papa.
Papa.
He can't speak.
What? What did the doctor say?
That it's God's will.
Get out of here.
Manolo, please.
Get out of here.
Get out!
Get out!
Papa.
Papa?
Papa.
##
Thank you.
Good afternoon, brother.
Brother?
Uh, Josemaría.
I know who you are, Josemaría.
I heard your sad news, Manolo.
You have been in my prayers.
Thank you.
But I don't need your brand of sympathy-
however sincere.
Manolo,
whatever struggles you are experiencing-
- Struggles?
- Well, whatever doubts you may be having.
Doubts. Struggles.
Josemaría, I blundered into the seminary
in deference to my mother.
I left because I wasn't priest material.
As you know.
Well, maybe not, but it doesn't mean
you're not saint material.
You know...
my recurring nightmare
is that I was partly to blame for you leaving.
No, Josemaría.
Unlike you,
I chose to live in the real world.
But I appreciate your concern.
It's not concern, Manolo.
It's love.
Our Lord said love,
and love is what he meant.
And it's what we owe each other. No?
Josemaría, the truth is...
we are born alone and we die alone.
All we have in between
is a battle I intend to win.
The rest is, frankly, sentimental drivel.
- ##
- Well, I will leave you.
Call on me.
I'll come, I promise.
Josemaría. You don't give up, do you?
It may help you to find some meaning
for your suffering, Manolo.
Suffering has no meaning. It's meaningless.
If you can show me otherwise,
I'll kiss your ass.
I know what it is to be angry at life.
Please be careful
where that leads you, Manolo.
Sheep.
Around the time
that Josemaría got a call from God...
Ah, Torres.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
##
- Well?
- A spy?
Yes. You.
But I expected something more.
With the king gone,
Spain has lost its center of gravity.
Which we will now re-create,
by force if needs be.
And other means.
But our government's elected. It's popular.
Its time is over.
The government is a rotten biscuit.
- Tap it and see the maggots emerge.
- Maggots?
Socialists who want a socialist state.
Stalinists who want a Stalinist state.
Anarchists who want no state at all.
Manolo, we want to create a new Spain.
-  A united Spain.
- Cleansed with blood if necessary.
Resurrected, great and as it once was-
- ordered, vigorous.
-  And admired.
-
-
##
They called us fascists.
- We called them communists.
- ##
Really, the world was much
more complicated than that.
But many preferred to see it
in those simple terms.
Three years later,
half a million people were dead-
some people are more interested
in hats and shoes.
I thought you were going to buy new shoes.
Uh, yes, I was, but, uh,
something else came up.
- What was that?
- No. L- I met an old lady who-
- Who needed a hat.
-  And some breakfast?
-  Yes, and some lunch.
- Thank you.
Sit down, please, Pedro, Isidoro.
Well, uh-
- So?
-
This group that keeps you from your homes-
what is it called?
We don't have a name, Mama.
We just refer to it as God's work.
Latin would sound better.
Well, your donkey may lack funds...
but the work has found its name.
What's next?
A communist strike killed my father.
-
- Get out of the car!
- Come here, scum!
-
- Put the hood on him!
- Please! No!
Yeah, we'll show you how just God is.
- In the boss's car.
-
Let's go!
Where's your gun?
This is not a game.
He killed your father.
Ah, damn it.
The bastard's shitting his pants.
-
- Do it.
Do it, damn it.
Pedro.
-  You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.
You're crazy.
He'll hate the whole idea.
Well, let's ask him.
Ask me?
This. We're gonna put them up
all over Madrid.
Look.
Not me, Father. Not me.
- A crusade?
- Yes, Father.
Using the cross to incite hatred and anger-
that's Christian?
Well, maybe not.
But, Father, the government
is openly attacking the church.
No, it isn't.
It's trying to modernize Spain.
Come on, Pedro.
If we don't do something,
we are just cowards.
- Or worse- traitors.
- Traitors.
- Traitors?
- Yes, Paco. Traitors.
That's what people are saying.
Standing by while the church gets attacked-
how is that being a good Catholic?
Pedro, is it understandable
to want to protect the church?
Yes, Father, but-
Juan, is it understandable
to want social justice?
Yes, of course.
Good. So the question is,
how do we achieve both?
By feeding the hungry.
And lunch is ready, so sit down now.
So we just let the matter drop?
No.
Look, I'm not going
to tell you what to think.
God gave each of you a brain
and reason and a conscience.
Why? So that you can
come to conclusions on your own...
and take personal responsibility for them.
But before rushing to act-
before trying to change the world-
first think about changing yourselves.
We're building something vital here together.
Now- especially now-
we have to be sowers of peace and joy.
And lunch, Mama.
- Father!
-
They've started killing priests.
- What?
- It's in the newspaper.
Oh, my God.
- Where?
- Here in Madrid.
Let me see.
So, what do we do now, Father?
Exactly what I just said, Juan.
Please.
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts...
which we are about to receive...
from your bounty, through Christ our Lord.
- Amen.
-  Amen.
Oh, what have we here?
Found a cockroach.
Hey, watch where you're going.
How about we squash it, eh?
-
- Let's squash him.
Well, well, well.
- Priest.
- What have we got here?
- A little priest?
- Oh, yeah.
- Whoa!
- Look there.
- I'm sorry.
- What's he carrying?
So, what have we got there? Huh?
- Come on. Show us.
- No, no. Please. Please.
Give me the packet,
or I stick you with this.
Stab the parasite.
I'm not a parasite.
I have to work for a living,
just like all of you.
Work for a living?
You know what working for a living is?
That's enough!
- That's enough!
-
Please! Get on the next one.
- Relax.
-
- Relax, old man.
- Please.
See you later, priest.
- I'm on your side.
- Fascist.
-
- Come on.
- We'll get you next time.
- Yeah.
They've got a thing
against enemies of their class.
- Can't say I blame them.
- No. I know.
All part of creating
this new, more civilized Spain.
Exactly.
And how will uncivilized behavior
accomplish that?
Can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.
No. Life is not an omelet.
And people are not eggs.
Okay. Hey, if I was you...
I'd stop wandering about
in that costume of yours.
It won't protect you anymore.
I don't wear this for protection.
You got balls for a bourgeois ass.
One, two. One, two.
One, two. One, two.
One, two. One, two.
One, two. One, two.
Thank you, Father.
One, two. Halt.
From their palaces, the bishops said...
Ready!
Aim! Fire!
-
-
-  Hey!
-
-
-
Hello?
Juan? Paco?
Happy birthday!
It's not my birthday.
Please. Come on.
Josemaría...
as your brother, I have been chosen...
to ask you to celebrate
our second year together...
by removing your shoes.
-
- Yes, Father!
- Take them off.
- Take off your shoes.
- Shoes off. Come on, Father.
- No.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- The shoes.
- Take them off.
- Behold a simple shoe.
-
But is it what it seems?
- Yes.
- Yes.
No. It is, in fact, a hole.
A hole masquerading as a shoe.
Oh!
And a hole surrounded by leather.
Shh! Shh!
But also a testament
to 20 kilometers a day...
seven days a week...
rain and shine.
- Yes!
- Thank you.
And in pity for this innocent shoe...
we have also pooled together for-
- Ta-da!
-
-  What nice shoes.
- Try them on.
-
-  Get down! Get down!
Santiago, get down!
- Santi!
- God!
Get down!
This is an announcement
from your government.
The army has recruited
the Spanish colonial army of Morocco.
All able-bodied Spaniards
who love their country-
It's remarkably easy to join a war.
- ##
- So far, I was enjoying being a spy.
There's something inspiring
about the common purpose...
I can't describe that ecstasy
of belonging to a crowd-
Cat got your tongue, comrade?
##
So many young people-
what do you know of suffering and death?
They will ask again and again,
"Is it worth it?"
And what will fill your hearts
with the answer "Yes"? Yes!
- Hatred of oppression? Of tyranny?
-  Yes!
- Hatred of those who treat us like animals-
-
Denying our hopes and stifling our lives?
Yes!
But more.
It will be faith-
faith that a new world will be
born from the blood of the old.
And comradeship, my brothers and sisters.
And courage-
courage to burst from our cages...
and set ourselves free to live noble...
as the eagle hovering
above his mountain peak.
- Or die in the attempt!
-
- ##
- Thanks.
- Name and country.
- Régis. France.
- Name and country.
- Jan. South Africa.
- Name and country.
- Petofi, lldiko. Hungary, sir.
There are no "sirs" in the Iron Brigade,
lldiko.
Peasants, factory workers...
some like me- escaped convicts.
We are what we are, but we are all equal.
But still fighting to be free-
as we all wish to be!
Lldiko Petofi.
Yes, sir.
- Oriol.
- Yes, Oriol.
- Jealous?
- No.
What is your name?
Manolo.
Viva la República!
Vival
Go, go, go!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Take cover! Move!
Fire! Fire! Fire!
Lldi- Ildi- Ildiko!
Stop. Go back. Face them.
Thank the bastards for testing your bravery.
Go!
Go! Go. Go.
- Torres.
- Yeah.
Look after her.
Forward!
Oh, God. I'm such a coward.
Me too.
I don't feel right about this.
You read the newspapers.
They don't exactly like priests out there,
Father.
Then don't call me Father
when I am dressed like this.
Call me Mariano.
-
- That's Vargas.
Come on, Father. I mean, Mariano.
Come on. The car is here.
Father, they'll be safe. Don't worry.
