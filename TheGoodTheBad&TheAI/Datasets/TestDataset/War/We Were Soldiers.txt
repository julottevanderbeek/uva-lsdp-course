These are the true events of November
A place our country does not remember,
in a war it does not understand.
This story is a testament to the Americans
who died in the Valley of Death
and a tribute to the People's Army
of Vietnam who died by our hand there.
To tell this story,
I must start at the beginning.
But where does it begin?
Maybe in June of 1954,
when French Group Mobile 100
moved into the highlands of Vietnam
where we would go eleven years later.
A couvert!
Gardez votres positions!
A derriere!
Feu a volonte!
A derriere!
Maybe this story begins in America,
when the Army first realised a new kind
of war was coming its way.
The White House wants a victory -
over cavemen in black pyjamas.
They've already beaten the French Army.
The French Army? What's that?
The problem in Vietnam is terrain.
Jungle, rivers - manoeuvre is a nightmare.
That's why we want to use helicopters.
Leap in and out of battle.
- They want you to test the idea.
- It'll take a hell of a combat leader.
I know a young Lt Colonel
named Hal Moore.
He led a combat company in Korea,
then he tested experimental parachutes.
Experimental parachutes?
Sounds like just the guy.
#..The other side of the mountain
Was all that he could see
# Was all that he could see,
was all that he could see
# The other side of the mountain
# Was all that he could see
# The bear went over the mountain
# The bear went over the mountain,
the bear went... #
How about we go back to Bingo?
What do you say? Bingo!
# B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O
# B-I-N-G-O
And Bingo was his name-oh! #
Tom? How much do you know
about our new colonel?
He was in Korea. Has a Masters
in International Relations from Harvard.
Harvard? He's not
one of those academic pussies, is he?
Hal Moore?
Come on, Too Tall,
give me your best shot, baby!
Oh! Did you see that, sports fans?
Did you see that? I'm going to the moon!
- Get up there.
- And he's coming around!
No, he's not.
You're out, Snakeshit! You're out!
Horseshit!
No wonder you can't fly, you can't see!
I believe you're out.
- You're a pilot?
- Too Tall, sir.
- Yeah. I can see that.
- You call, we haul.
- Can I speak to you for a minute, Crandall?
- Sir.
- Out.
- Safe.
- Out.
- Safe.
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Sure.
So your men call you Snakeshit?
It's an affectionate appellation
of my comrades-in-arms, sir.
I fly lower than snake shit.
Well, I got a problem, Snakeshit,
and I think you're the solution.
I've never been called a solution.
You know what Air Cavalry really means?
You fly into hostile territory, outnumbered,
ten thousand miles from home.
The battleground's the size
of a football field,
and if the choppers stop coming,
we all get slaughtered.
I figure chopper pilots won't fly into hell
for strangers, so... I'm Hal Moore.
I know, sir. Why us?
Well, your guys look like shit,
but your equipment is immaculate.
Yesterday you didn't have to train,
but you did.
And you've got pilots like Too Tall.
He's way outside the limits of Army Regs.
They want to fly with you for some reason.
I guess they think you're the best.
It's because I only recruit the dumb ones, sir.
I suppose I have a choice in all this?
You sure don't.
I wouldn't miss it for the world. To the Air Cav.
- Good morning, Sergeant Major.
- How do you know what kind of day it is?
Group! Attention!
At ease, gentlemen.
Welcome to the new cavalry.
We will ride into battle.
And this will be our horse.
You don't have to catch it.
You don't have to feed it.
But I can assure you
that neither the new technology,
nor your status as officers...
will keep you above the danger.
Sergeant Major Plumley and I
come from the paratroopers,
where the officer is always
the first one out of the plane.
Because to follow your instincts
and to inspire your men by your example...
you have to be with them
where the metal meets the meat.
Sergeant Major Plumley made all four
combat jumps in the 82nd Airborne
during World War Two -
Sicily, Salerno, Normandy and Holland,
plus one more in Korea.
He answers to me and to me alone.
Now, I hope you gentlemen like training
because me and the Sergeant Major...
we love it.
Three strikes and you're not out!
There is always one more thing you can do.
- Come on, boys.
- Go! Get out!
- Two...
- Let's go!
Three.
- Pretty good, huh?
- Pretty good.
There's only one thing wrong.
Be sharp! We will be the best platoon
in this battalion!
Be ready in there! Let's go! Let's go!
All right! Your officer's dead!
What do you do? What do you do?
All right. He hesitated, he's dead.
What do you do?
- Get off the chopper.
- Get off the chopper!
All right. All officers.
Come on in.
Savage, you learn the job
of the man above you,
and you teach your job
to the man below you in rank.
- That goes for every man. Understood?
- Yes, sir!
We'll be landing under fire, gentlemen.
Men will die.
Have you said your prayers?
- No?
- No.
I'll say them with you.
Fall in.
All right. Ready, set?
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women
and blessed is the fruit of thy...
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us...
Cecile, I don't hear you praying, honey.
I don't want to be a Catholic.
I want to be a Methodist, like Mommy.
You do?
- Why is that, honey?
- So I can pray whatever I want.
- That's a sin!
- No, no, it's not a sin.
God just made you hard-headed.
It's not a sin.
Um, I'll tell you what. You want to pray
and thank God for our family?
- Yes, sir.
- That's good. Let's do it.
Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
I can hear you laughing even in here.
I'm not laughing, I'm marvelling.
Marvelling about what?
You find stubbornness in your children
and think it comes from anybody but you.
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm.
I'll give you something to marvel at.
Sshh! The children...
When I pray...whatever I want...
I thank God for you.
- Beautiful morning, Sergeant Major.
- You a fucking weatherman now?
Look what I found
for the new baseball player.
They've sent us
a bunch of officers.
Real green. Gotta train them up.
Must be thinking of starting a new unit.
They sent new rifles too - the M-16.
- It's supposed to be a good weapon.
- Lots of plastic.
Feels like a BB gun to me.
I think I'll stick with my pistol.
- You think we'll get close enough for that?
- What do you think, sir?
A leader must remain cool and calm.
He must learn to ignore explosions,
the heat and the dust,
the screams of the wounded.
This is normal on a battlefield. Normal.
Colonel, you need to get a company over
to reinforce the left flank.
- Where the hell's that coming from?
- It's our advisors in Vietnam.
The radio's picking up atmospheric bounce.
When Crazy Horse was a baby...
he nursed from the breast
of every woman in the tribe.
The Sioux raised their children that way.
Every warrior called every woman in the tribe
"Mother",
every older warrior they called "Grandfather".
The point here is they fought as a family.
Take care of your men.
Teach them to take care of each other...
'cause when this starts,
each other is all we're gonna have.
- Did you tune that in?
- Yes, sir.
That's fine. You're my radio operator.
- I...
- You'll be fine. You'll work it out.
Any of you sons-of-bitches
calls me Grandpa...
I'll kill you.
Godboldt, take your boots off.
Go on.
Everybody, take your boots off.
Everybody. Socks too.
I want you to draw fresh socks from supply
and keep your feet dusted with powder.
Everybody check each other's feet
like Godboldt and me.
- Now, that young man's a leader.
- Yes, sir.
But that other fella - that big strong one there.
He wants to win medals.
He's eager.
Ladies. I'm really glad you're here today.
I know that some of you are new to the Army
and all of us are new to this post,
so I thought we could pool our resources
and cover whatever questions we might have.
Why don't we start
with item number one - food?
If the commissary is out of something,
where's the best place to shop?
I tried Big Star and it's OK.
But I keep thinking my water's going to break
at the check-out aisle!
That takes care of food shopping.
So item number two - laundry.
The washing machines don't work.
They're full of sand.
- I'll take care of that.
- I've complained.
Well, we'll just go to the General.
The laundromat in town's OK, but they
won't let you wash coloured things.
- In a public laundromat?
- It doesn't make sense,
but they have a sign in the window saying
"Whites Only".
- What?
- Honey, they mean white people only.
That's awful. Your husband is wearing
the uniform of a country that allows a place
to say that his laundry's not good enough,
when he could die for...
- I'm sorry. I...
- That's all right, honey.
I know what my husband's fighting for
and that's why I can smile.
My husband will never ask for respect,
and he'll give respect to no man
who hasn't earned it.
The rest of his family's the same way.
They can keep their goddamn
washing machine
because my baby's clothes are clean
anyway.
Well, I guess that takes care
of item number two!
- Are you all right?
- I think my water just broke.
OK. OK. We're all calm.
We're all calm. A car!
- Colonel.
- At ease. At ease.
I heard my new Lieutenant's
become a father. Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.
- I didn't want to disturb you.
No, no, it's fine. It's all right. Please.
- How's your wife?
- She's OK. She's OK.
She's sleeping. So is my daughter.
I just wanted to be here for a while
before I held her.
- This her tag? What's this say?
- Oh, Camille. I'm sorry about this.
Don't you take that off. That's an order.
- Colonel, may I ask you a question?
- Sure.
What do you think
about being a soldier and a father?
I hope that being good at the one
makes me better at the other.
Why? What about you?
I don't know, sir.
Between college and here,
Barbara and I spent a year in Africa.
We helped build a school for orphans.
They were orphans because the warlord
across the border didn't like their tribe.
I know God has a plan for me.
I just hope it's to help protect orphans...
not make any.
Well, why don't we ask him?
Come on, let's go ask him.
Our Father in Heaven,
before we go into battle,
every soldier among us will approach you
each in his own way.
Our enemies too,
according to their own understanding,
will ask for protection and for victory.
And so we bow before your infinite wisdom.
We offer our prayers as best we can.
I pray you watch over the young men
like Jack Geoghegan
that I lead into battle.
You use me as your instrument
in this awful hell of war to watch over them.
Especially if they're men
like this one beside me,
deserving of a future in your blessing
and goodwill.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Oh! Yes, and one more thing, dear Lord.
About our enemies...
ignore their heathen prayers and help us
blow those bastards to hell.
Amen again.
There's the one about the kid
with the apple tree or the flying horse,
- the fairytales with the deer and stuff.
- Daddy?
- Yes?
- What is a war?
War is um... Well, it's...
It's something that shouldn't happen,
but it does.
And er...
And it's when some people
in another country - or in any country -
try to take the lives of other people.
And then soldiers like your daddy have to...
It's my job to go over there and stop them.
Are they gonna try to take your life away,
Daddy?
Well, yes, Cecile, they're gonna try,
but I'm not gonna let them.
Can't sleep?
No.
The men are so young and now
they've sent me a new crop even greener.
And when I look at them, I see our boys.
Then you're just the man to lead them.
I guess.
We intend to convince the Communist
that we cannot be defeated by force of arms.
I have asked the commanding general,
General Westmoreland...
what more he needs to meet
this mounting aggression.
He has told me. And we will meet his needs.
I have today ordered to Vietnam the Air
Mobile Division and certain other forces,
which will raise our fighting strength
from 75,000
to 125,000 men almost immediately.
Additional forces will be needed later
and they will be sent...
Get out your best dresses, ladies.
They're going to want to celebrate.
# Don't you ever be scared
# Lean on me... #
The President didn't say State of Emergency.
No, he didn't.
Without that our enlistments
won't be extended.
I'm sorry, Hal.
Forgive me, sir, but let me get this straight.
We form a division using techniques
that have not been attempted in battle,
against an enemy with 20 years
of combat experience on his ground,
twelve thousand miles away from our ground.
And right before the Army sends us into
the fight, they take away a third of my men.
- The most experienced third.
- I don't like it any better than you, Hal.
I don't know, sir.
You saw this coming, didn't you? Yes.
That's why you gave me
those new platoon leaders.
Korea didn't teach them anything.
- Politicians?
- Politicians...
# Hold me, hold me
# Never let me go
# Until you're told me, told me
# What I want to know
and then just hold me, hold me
# Make me tell you I'm in love with you
# Thrill me, thrill me... #
Thank you, sir.
By the way, Hal, since we're being deployed,
they're renumbering the units.
You're the commanding officer of the First
Battalion of the Seventh Cavalry.
The Seventh?
The same regiment as Custer?
Thank you, sir.
# Don't be fooled,
thinking this is the last you'll find
# But they never stood
in the dark with you, love
# When you take me in your arms
and drive me slowly out of my mind
# Kiss me, kiss me
# And when you do I know
that you will miss me
# Miss me
# If we ever say "Adieu",
so kiss me, kiss me
# Let me tell me I'm in love with you
# Kiss me, kiss me, when you do I know
that you will miss me... #
Look around you.
In the Seventh Cavalry, we've got a captain
from the Ukraine.
Another from Puerto Rico.
We've got Japanese, Chinese,
Blacks, Hispanics, Cherokee Indians.
Jews and Gentiles.
All American.
Now, here in the States,
some men in this unit
may experience discrimination
because of race or creed.
But for you and me now, all that is gone.
We're moving
into the Valley of the Shadow of Death...
where you will watch the back of the man
next to you, as he will watch yours.
And you won't care what colour he is
or by what name he calls God.
They say we're leaving home.
We're going to what home
was always supposed to be.
So let us understand the situation.
We are going into battle
against a tough and determined enemy.
I can't promise you
that I will bring you all home alive.
But this I swear...
before you and before almighty God
that when we go into battle,
I will be the first to set foot on the field...
and I will be the last to step off...
and I will leave no one behind.
Dead or alive...
we will all come home together.
So help me God.
I love you.
- Hal.
- Sir.
Last night, the enemy hit our camp
at Plaei Me.
- How many casualties?
- None.
The enemy withdrew towards
this mountain on the Cambodian border.
- How many men do you have battle ready?
- Sergeant Major?
What do you estimate the enemy strength?
We appraise their numbers as manageable.
- You have no idea.
- We have no idea.
Simple orders, Hal.
Find the enemy and kill him.
They attack us - no casualties -
then they run and hide in the mountains.
Naturally, we chase them, of course.
Does it smell like an ambush to you?
If they're close enough to kill us,
we'll be close enough to kill them.
Round trip a chopper, 30 minutes.
That means the first 60 men on the ground
will be there a half hour alone.
Son-of-a-bitch. I think maybe
you ought to get yourself an M-16.
When the time comes I need one, sir,
there'll be plenty of them lying on the ground.
Well, let's go do what we came here to do.
Yes, sir.
Carry on!

It was a Sunday. November 14th 1965.
Before that day, the soldiers
of North Vietnam and those of America
had never met each other in a maajor battle.
Two mi les out. Droppi ng to nap of the earth.
First Platoon, let's move.
It's a scout! Let's take him prisoner!
Lieutenant!
There he goes! Come on!
Come on!
Captain, keep in contact
with all the patrols.
Hey, hey... I got something here. I got a boy!
Hell, that ain't no boy.
- He say he deserter.
- Bullshit. He's a look-out.
Ask him where his friends are.
He say this is base camp for whole division.
Where?
That mountain.
The same army that destroyed French.
He say they want to kill Americans very badly.
Just not been able to find any yet.
Captain Metsker, tell the patrols
to hold their positions.
You, take the radio.
- Sir...
- We gotta get that guy.
Captain, call in all the patrols.
We have to engage the enemy
as far away from the LZ as possible.
Net call, this is Trojan Two.
Grab the wounded! Make contact!
Get to high ground! Cover fire!
Get to high ground!
Come on! Get up here!
Cover fire! Cover fire!
Everybody down! Get down!
Check your ammo! Everybody check ammo!
Come on, I'll get us out of here!
- Grab the wounded, we'll make a run...
- Sarge!
We gotta get out of here!
Stay down! Don't anybody move!
Bungum, stay down!
You're gonna be OK.
Stay down.
Form a perimeter!
Conserve your ammo and stay down!
What's happening with those patrols?
Hey! Hey!
Calm down! Understand the situation
and communicate clearly!
Pull the chain on all the firepower
you can get on that mountain!
Alert Crandall that we have a hot LZ.
Agent Serpent Six, this is Trojan Two.
You're coming into a hot LZ.
We're taking fire.
Repeat. We are taking fire.
No shit.
This is Too Tall. We hear you.
Roger that. Trojan Two out!
Herrick's platoon is cut off and under attack.
Bravo Company's holding.
They're gonna try and flank us.
Move!
- We gotta go.
- We're outta here.
Move!
Savage.
Savage.
All right. I got you.
- D-d-d...
- Sir?
Don't let them get the signals codes.
Roger that, sir.
I'm glad I could die for my country.
Doc...?
- Bungum?
- Sarge.
Tell my wife I love her.
This is Savage.
I need artillery at these co-ordinates.
Niner-three-three-zero-one...
Ernie! Ernie, help! We got more coming!
We are cut off. Copy? We are cut off.
Fire!
There's close to a hundred more, sir!
They're right on top of us, sir!
Bring it in close!
It's a hot LZ. We'll be jumping.
We will not touch down!
They're trying to break right through us.
I want you to reinforce Alpha Company there.
Yes, sir! Follow me!
Charlie Company up on the ridge!
Doc, the wounded
are over by that termite mound. Go!
If you don't find some cover, you'll go down.
If you go down, we all go down. Come on!
Cobain!
I want the M-60 right here!
Radio!
Sir, it's Captain Edwards on the ridge, sir!
- Bob.
- Colonel, these guys are regulars.
Heavily armed.
AK-47s and pouches of grenades!
Heavy machine-guns
and shoulder-fired rockets!
Captain Nadal. That creek bed is vital.
Vital! Now, they'll be coming right at you.
Do not let them flank.
I repeat, do not let them flank!
Secure the creek bed!
Tom, keep trying to raise
those Medevac boys.
Tom? Tom?
- I'm all right.
- Charlie, come here.
I want you to get me all the air support
you can get me on that mountain. Now!
Requesting immediate air support.
I need you to burn them out on hill top.
Alpha, shift to Alpha Bravo.
Co-ordinates - Golf 4-5-2...
- Give me something higher up!
- Shifting to hilltop, Bravo. Golf 4-5-7-2.
I'll say again. 4-5-7-2.
- Medevac Commander, are you inbound?
- Looks pretty hot down there.
Yeah. You can make it.
Watch our approach. Follow us in.
Copy that, Seventh Cav.
We will follow your approach.
Get over there. Reinforce Charlie Company.
The Medevac guys are bugging out
and leaving the wounded!
- Snake, get out of here!
- Bring in the wounded!
Get the wounded!
Come on! Come on!
Come here. They're still trying to flank us.
Stretch out along the line.
Radio!
Trojan Six, we're in heavy contact.
In danger of being overrun!
If they get the LZ, we've had it. Can you hold?
We're spread thin, sir, but we'll give 'em hell.
Crandall, this is Troajan Six. It's too hot
down here. I'm closing the LZ.
- You copy that, Too Tall?
- Copy that, Snake.
All Seventh Cavalry units,
LZ X-Ray is closed.
- I don't li ke it. A whole battalion massacred.
- You think this is a massacre?
Losing a lot of draftees is a bad week.
Losing a colonel is a massacre.
Moore is still fighting.
He's against more men than he can count.
A platoon is lost.
They're not lost.
They're cut off and surrounded.
Then they're lost.
- Sergeant Major!
- Sir!
We need to carve out an emergency LZ
right over there.
- Sir.
- Blow the trees down.
Fire in the hole!
Colonel, this is Snakeshit and Too Tall.
- We're coming in with two loads of ammo.
- We've blown a new LZ.
Come in from the east. Out.
It's Brigade Headquarters, they want you out.
- We can't get out, damnit!
- Not all of us, just you.
Saigon wants to debrief you.
That doesn't make any sense.
Say again. Will you repeat that order?
Too Tall, follow the Colonel to the new LZ.
I see him, Snake.
Let's go! Move!
Shit!
Come on, we'll give you a hand.
All right, get that ammo off
and get the wounded on!
Bring them on. Get them on, boys.
No, no! We're overloaded. Leave him.
No. I'll get out. It's Ray.
He's hurt worse than me.
You hang on. I'll see you back there, Ray.
You, me and Oulette are all we have
in reserve.
Yeah. We're slacking up a little.
No. We're just regrouping for another assault.
Distribute that ammo.
- Oulette!
- Sir.
Tell Crandall he's got time
for one more flight in here.
Agent Serpent, this is Trojan Six...
Doc, get this water to the wounded.
Everybody's out of water.
It must be terrible for them.
And those guys are cut off out there.
- Running low on ammo, Sarge!
- Pick your target. One shot, one kill. OK?
- Roger that, Sarge.
- How are we doing, Doc?
- Ernie, we're out of water.
- That's the last of it.
- My face is on fire!
- Phosphorus! Hold still! Hold still!
Don't touch your face. Hold still.
- Doc! Doc! It's phosphorus.
- OK.
Does anybody have any more bandages?!
Ernie!
- Ernie, you hit too? You hit?
- No. I'm OK.
Our guys are gonna come for us?
- Yeah.
- When?
Plug his wound.
That's the main LZ, but it's closed.
This is Too Tall. I'm clear.
Crandall's clear.
- Colonel.
- Geoghegan.
I want you to go and reinforce the company
on that ridge.
- Yes, sir!
- OK. Keep your head down.
To the top of the ridge! Move it!
Captain Nadal? We've got to break through
to that cut-off platoon.
We got an American platoon out there.
We've got an Air Cav platoon cut off
out there!
Air Cav! Air Cav! Going over!
I said, "I know. Your mom asked me
to give you $600!"
Good luck to you.
- You got enough room for one more?
- If you're crazy enough, get in.
Yes, sir.
Hey, what are those lights down there?
Enemy soldiers.
They use candles on the trail.
They're moving into position to attack.
Here we go!
Help them unload that shit!
OK, let's go! Let's go!
Your boys have done a helluva job
today, Snake.
That's the last flight for tonight, Colonel,
but you need us, you call us.
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a reporter, sir.
- Hell.
- Joe Galloway, UPI. How's it going, sir?
We've been flat to the boards.
We're greatly outnumbered.
We got more enemy coming, sir.
Saw a chain of lights coming in.
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.
- Well, I can't guarantee your safety.
- Yes, sir. I know.
- Where are you from, son?
- Rufugio, Texas, sir.
That's the first thing I heard all day
that makes any sense.
- Captain Dillon!
- Sir!
- Did you see those lights?
- We're on it now, sir.
- You fry those sons-of-bitches.
- This is Trojan Three.
Fire emissions. Tango Foxtrot 4-9-6-5-6-9.
Repeat, Tango Foxtrot...
All operations are suspended
for the evening.
Morning operations are scheduled
for 0530 hours.
- Where's Crandall?
- He's right there, sir.
- Crandall! You led my men into a hot LZ.
- Somebody had to fly out the wounded.
Don't you play hotshot with me!
You suckered us in there.
Do it again, I'll have you busted!
You got the balls to face me,
but not the enemy!
Whoa! Hey! Whoa!
If I ever see you again, I'll kill you.
That's right.
Hey.
What a day, huh?
Tomorrow will be worse.
If they make it to tomorrow.
Ernie, I can smell them.
- Dead bodies stink.
- It's not the dead ones.
I can smell them crawling up on us.
I'm telling you.
I need illumination. 6-5-0-1-5-0-1.
I need artillery on previously-established
targets! Alpha, Bravo and Charlie.
Fire for effect! Fire for effect!
Save your ammo! Cease fire!
Is anybody hit?
Captain, if you guys are coming,
you better let us know.
I don't want to shoot any of our guys. Copy?
Savage, we can't make it tonight.
Don't worry. You're gonna make it.
We'll come get you in the morning.
Yes, sir.
Out.
Hey, you're doing a fine job, son. Don't worry.
We gave them more than they gave us today.
Keep it up.
How you boys doing? Keep on doing
what you're doing and you'll be fine.
Your men have done a hell of a job today,
Lieutenant Geoghegan.
They won't get through, sir.
Count on it.
I know that, Jack. Keep it up, son.
It's Rear Headquarters.
- How is it, Colonel?
- We're surrounded, but we're holding on.
Sir, I need a confirmed count
of our dead and wounded.
- I've got to know where all my boys are.
- You'll get it, Hal.
- Here they come.
- Captain Edwards.
We need illumination on the perimeter.
Whisky-Five, this is Six-Alpha.
I need illumination now.
Cathy?
Cathy?
Cathy?
A telegram! A cab delivers a telegram.
"The Secretary of the Army re...regrets..."
Mrs Moore? Colonel Moore's wife?
Yes.
I need help finding an address.
- I'm looking for...
- You jackass!
Do you know what this is?!
Do you know what you just did to me?!
I don' t like this job, ma'am.
I'm just trying to do it.
Wait. Wait.
I'll take it to her.
Tell the cab company if there are any others,
just bring them to me.
Julie.
I just went by to see Catherine.
Everybody knows.
No chaplains or counsellors? Cab drivers?
The Army wasn't ready.
I'll go with you.
- Thanks.
- Who's it for?
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
No!
I thought she would hate me.
Your husband didn't start the war. They all
knew this could happen and so did we.
- I'll take care of this.
- I'll go with you.
We'll do one at a time, OK?
- We won't look. OK?
- OK.
Julie. Do you think they'll bring
more telegrams tomorrow?
If there are, come and get me.
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
Out of the depths I cry to thee, O Lord.
Lord, hear my voice.
Let thy voice be attentive
to the voice of my supplications.
Thou, O Lord, shall mark our iniquities.
Lord, who can abide them?
With thee there is mercy.
Grant them eternal rest, O Lord,
and may perpetual light shine among them.
Through the mercy of God,
may they rest in peace. Amen.
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.
- You got a death wish, Galloway?
- No, sir.
Well, why are you here?
I knew these dead boys would be here, sir.
Why aren't you a soldier?
You got the guts for it.
My daddy was a soldier. My grand-daddy.
Two of my great grand-daddies were soldiers.
Hell, that's how I came to be.
Each of them lost a leg in the Civil War.
My great grand-daddy Galloway lost his left
and my great grand-daddy Reid lost his right.
They met in a shoe store in Galveston.
Every year after that, the same date,
the same store,
they'd get together
and pick out a new pair of shoes.
- You are shitting me?
- No, sir. I swear to God.
Anyway, one had a daughter, one had a son -
my grandparents.
What the hell were the odds of them
having the same shoe size?
I don't know, Colonel.
It was meant to be, I guess.
Yeah. Meant to be.
Galloways have been in every war
this country has ever fought.
But when it came to this one,
I didn't think I could stop the war.
I just thought maybe I might try
and understand one.
Maybe help the folks back home understand.
I just figured I could do that better
shooting a camera than shooting a rifle.
Well...
I sure hope you make it through this one.
You too, Colonel.
Aagh!
Right 20!
Put it right on them! Right on them!
Colonel, sir.
- Captain Nadal.
- Sir.
- What is it, sir?
- Nothing's wrong, except nothing's wrong.
- Go back to the termite mound. You'll be fine.
- Roger that, sir.
All right. Pass the word on.
Every man fires three rounds on anything
that looks suspicious to them. On my signal.
They're gonna hit us like this
along the whole perimeter.
- We gotta get back to that mound.
- Stay here a minute, sir.
Shit!
We need a medic!
Sir! Sir! Captain Edwards.
Charlie Company on the ridge.
Bob?
They're inside the artillery. I need... Aagh!
Bob? Bob?
Godboldt, I need a grenade!
Go, Willie! Come on, let's go!
Godboldt's down!
I'll get him!
Willie!
Get those guys some help over there!
Captain Dillon, get Bravo Company
to send a platoon across the LZ.
Support Charlie Company.
Bravo Six, this is Trojan Three...
Tell Charlie Company to get real small in
their holes. I'm gonna drop artillery on them.
Charlie Company, get small.
We got A.T. coming right on top of you.
- We're being overrun!
- No, boys. We're gonna win this fight.
Sir, they've brought a main force
V.C. battalion against us.
Sir, I request that you dispatch
another company of reinforcements
as soon as it can be accomplished.
How bad is it, Hal?
It's getting pretty sporty down here, sir.
Get out of the way!
Aim. Aim!
Medic! Get a medic over here!
- Hey, what's your name, soldier?
- Jimmy Nakayama.
- I got a baby being born today.
- Congratulations!
Thanks.
Medic!
Medic!
Can't take no pictures down there.
Down. Right there.
- Sir, I'm a non-combatant, sir.
- Ain't no such thing today, boy.
Why aren't those mortars firing?
What's the problem here?
These tubes are red hot, sir. I'm afraid
we'll cook a round and blow us all up.
We can't cool them off
'cause we're out of water.
Come on, what are you waiting for?
Gentlemen! Prepare to defend yourselves!
Grenade!
Negative! My pilots do not see the enemy.
They cannot pick out our friendlies.
You gotta tell your Company Commander
to pop smoke now.
- They need to mark the lines right now.
- We have no lines!
We have enemies and friendlies
all over the place.
Sir, our perimeter's collapsing.
Alpha and Bravo Companies cannot hold.
Charlie Company's being overrun.
Net call! Net call...
Hastings!
Broken Arrow!
Broken Arrow! I'll say it again, Broken Arrow!
Broken Arrow!
- Confirm. Broken Arrow.
- Broken Arrow. Confirm.
- Broken Arrow?
- An American unit is being overrun.
It calls in every combat aircraft for support.
My God, there's no hiding it now.
Charlie Company, report!
Bravo Company, report!
Planes are on their way, Colonel!
Sir!
Roger that.
We have planes stacked up every thousand
feet from seven to 35,000. We'll get 'em, sir.
Advancing. Co-ords on our position at 1-5-0...
Lima 9-6-2-5-0-7.
We're getting closer in on 3-1-5 degrees.
That's 0-5-0-0 degrees! 0-5-0-0!
Goddamnit.
Company of enemy in the open
advancing north on our position.
Approximately 0-1-5 degrees at 1-5-0.
We're getting closer in at 3-1-5 degrees
at 0-5-0-0...
Charlie, call that son-of-a-bitch off!
Abort! Pull up!
Get down!
Charlie! Charlie, listen to me!
You're keeping us alive.
You forget about that one.
Keep them coming in. You're doing well, son.
Medic!
Medic!
Medic!
Oh, God! Jimmy.
You know this guy? You know him,
talk to him. Just talk to him.
Jimmy, do you hear me?
It's Joe Galloway.
We're gonna get you out of here.
We gotta get him to the landing zone.
Grab his leg.
You gotta get him out of here. I can't help you.
You gotta do it by yourself.
Get him on that chopper. OK?
Yes, sir.
Tell my wife I love her. And my baby.
You tell them.
- Get Nadal.
- Sir!
We put 'em back.
We got us a lull. I want you to attack.
I want you to go in there
and rescue that cut-off platoon.
Yes, sir! First squad, move out!
Add 50. Keep moving the artillery forward.
- Keep walking the artillery forward.
- Spread it out!
Move it! Keep moving forward!
Sergeant Savage! You guys still here?
We have 40 KIA. We have two MIA.
Those are the latest numbers.
That's a nice day, Sergeant Savage.
Right.
All right, boys. Let's get 'em up, get 'em out.
Let's get 'em outta here!
Get 'em on the chopper!
Since most of the wounded men
are from Charlie Company,
- I want you to take their place. Follow me.
- Yes, sir. Let's go.
Captain, dig in some firing steps. Then throw
dirt on those bodies - keep the smell down.
Roger, Sergeant Major.
Makes you wish you signed up
for submarines, don't it?
Colonel, Brigade Headquarters wants you
lifted out on the first chopper.
What idiot keeps ordering that
in the middle of a battle?
- General Westmoreland wants a briefing.
- Give me that.
I am in a fight and I object to this order
to return to Saigon.
Now, I will not leave my men.
Is that clear? Out.
There's two of my men unaccounted for
and I figure they'll be out there some place.
- Let's get 'em. What do you say?
- I'm with you, sir.
All right. Let's go.
Julie.
They...
brought another.
- Oh, God, Julie. It's yours.
- No.
He died keeping my promise.
Sir, they're ordering us all out. All of us.
They're going to march reinforcements in.
They don't understand a damn thing,
do they? We can't get out.
He's waiting in a cave
and that's what he wants.
The moment he sees live soldiers
on the helicopter, he'll be all over us.
Then he'll get his massacre.
Requesting permission to rejoin the lines, sir.
All right, son.
Carry on, sir.
I wonder what was in Custer's mind when
he realised he'd led his men into a slaughter.
Sir, Custer was a pussy.
You ain't.
Goddamn.
Hell...
Right now they're planning their final attack -
the one that's going to finish us off.
They'll nibble at us all night, then come dawn,
they'll hit us with everything they've got.
That's what I'd do if I was him.
Sergeant Major,
hand out the last of the ammunition.
Yes, sir.
Fix bayonets!

You were wondering how Custer felt, sir.
You oughta ask him.
Sergeant Savage!
Checking for documents, I found this
on the guy who tried to bayonet you.
Translated some of it, mostly personal.
Thought you might want to see it.
- Joe!
- Joe!
- What was that?
- American artillery.
- Friendly fire.
- How many casualties?
What the hell happened here, Joe?
Hey, Joe...
Colonel Moore? Colonel Moore!
Colonel! Colonel Moore!
- Colonel. What was the key to your victory?
- Tell us how you feel.
Will the United States take
the North Vietnamese seriously now?
How do you feel about the loss of your men?
Have you notified the families, sir?
I'm glad you made it, son.
Thank you, sir. You too.
I'll never forgive myself.
For what, sir?
That my men...
That my men died and I didn't.
Sir, I don't... I don't know how to tell this story.
Well, you got to, Joe.
You tell the American people
what these men did here.
You tell them how my troopers died.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
All of our men, living and dead,
are off the field, sir.
Well done, Sergeant Major.
In Saigon, Hal Moore's superiors
congratulated him
for killing over 1,800 enemy soldiers.
Then ordered him to lead his men
back into the Valley of Death.
He led them and fought beside them
for 235 more days.
- Kids, go to bed.
- Someone's at the door.
Go to bed!
Children! Your daddy's home!
Daddy! Daddy!
Some had families waiting...
for others, their only family would be the men
they had bled beside.
There were no bands, no flags,
no armed guards to welcome them home.
They went to war because their country
ordered them to,
but, in the end, they fought
not for their country or their flag.
They fought for each other.
"Dear Barbara,
"l have no words to express to you
my sadness at the loss of Jack.
"The world is a lesser place without him.
But I know he is with God and the angels,
"and even Heaven is improved
by his presence there.
"l know you too are sure of this,
"and yet this knowledge can 't diminish
his loss and your grief.
"With abiding respect and affection,
Hal Moore. "
We who have seen war
never stop seeing it.
In the silence of the night,
we will always hear the screams.
So this is our story.
For we were soldiers once...and young.
# To fallen soldiers let us sing
# Where no rockets fly nor bullets wing
# Our broken brothers let us bring
# To the Mansions of the Lord
# No more bleeding, no more fight
# No prayers pleading through the night
# Just divine embrace, eternal light
# In the Mansions of the Lord
# Where no mothers cry
and no children weep
# We shall stand and guard
though the angels sleep
# While through the ages safely keep
# The Mansions of the Lord #
# Lay me doon
# In the caul, caul groon
# Whaur afore
# Monie mair huv gaun
# Ains a year
# Say a prayer faur me
# Close yir een
