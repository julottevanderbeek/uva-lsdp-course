"From the Secretary
of the Navy
"to Fleet Admiral
William. F. Halsey, Jr.,
U.S. Navy.
"Subject, retirement."
Everything's
ready, sir.
Thank you.
Manuel.
Yes, sir.
What are your plans?
I'll go back to Luzon, sir.
My brother has a farm.
I'm invited to live there.
That sounds peaceful.
Yes, sir.
You may find it
too peaceful.
If I do, sir,
I have only to remember
the unpeaceful times
we have known.
It was enough excitement
for one lifetime.
Yeah, I guess so.
Manuel?
Yes, sir.
What do you remember
best?
Sir, I can remember
the Gilbert Islands,
the Marshall Islands,
the Tokyo raid, Kwajalein
and so many others,
their names I cannot remember.
But the one that will
always stay clear in
my mind is Guadalcanal.
What's our ETA
for Guadalcanal?
I've had it.
You can't read it
if you can't see it.
Enterprise.
How we doing, Andy?
We'll land before daylight,
if there's anything
to land on.
Tokyo Express
has been shelling
Guadalcanal all night.
They estimate 6,000 more
Japanese troops will land.
Six thousand.
Why couldn't the old man
have chosen someplace
else to inspect?
Yeah, someplace
where they got some nurses
or some pretty girls.
Probably on account
of you.
Casanova.
Old man asleep?
Thanks to Doc.
How'd you manage
that, Doc?
With a great
big pill.
You mean you got the
old man to take a pill?
Sure I did.
No, I don't
believe it.
He's out like a light.
It's the first time
he's closed his eyes
since we left Pearl Harbor.
Yeah.
Say, wouldn't this be
a good time to sneak in there
and give him his shots?
He needs the sleep more.
I thought you gave him
the shots last week?
No, no. We came close,
but he got away again.
I never seen a body so afraid
of a little old hypodermic
needle as the old man is.
Well, you got him
to take a pill, that's
a major victory in itself.
That's right.
Yeah.
Won't be long now.
Andy just sent
an ETA for 0600.
That's less than an hour.
We must've picked up
a tail wind.
Yeah.
Sit down,
sit down.
Sleep well,
Admiral?
Fine.
That pill really
did the trick, huh? Yeah.
Slept like a baby.
We've gone through
all the reports
on this area, sir.
What do you make
of them?
What can we make of them?
We're losing our shirt.
Granted. Our job is
to find out why.
Primarily, I think it's
a matter of logistics.
Logistics hell, it's morale.
Command. I say they ought to
send in a new pitcher.
Relieve Admiral Ghormley?
Yes, sir.
Until we've acquainted
ourselves with the situation,
I suggest
we reserve our opinions.
FRANK: Yes, sir.
For your information,
the old man thinks the world
of Admiral Ghormley.
They're old friends.
What's our position,
Andy?
We're three minutes
ahead of
flight plan, sir.
How long you been
on this course?
About an hour, sir.
What's the weather
at Guadalcanal?
Forecast is for clear.
Is anything wrong, sir,
with the flight plan?
How's it going, Chief?
Fine, Admiral.
Been receiving Noumea
loud and clear.
Anything new?
No, sir.
Except this
wasn't sent to us,
but I picked it up.
ANDY: Noumea's reporting
unusual Japanese radio traffic
between Truk and Guadalcanal.
Sit down.
I think we'll pass up
Guadalcanal.
Tell Andy to change course
to Noumea, direct.
Aye, aye, sir.
KING: Good, sir. I'm glad
you concur, Mr. President.
Yes. Thank you, sir. Goodbye.
Operator, do you still have
Pearl Harbor on the line?
Yes, Ernie?
He's in the air right now.
He doesn't have any decoding
equipment on the plane.
Pulaski of
Admiral Ghormley's staff.
Good trip, sir?
Uneventful, I'm glad to say.
You were to
receive this
at once, sir.
Oh, damn. That's what
I call a smart move.
Where's
Admiral Ghormley?
He's waiting for you
on the
sir.
All right, Andy.
Let's go.
Permission to
come aboard, sir?
Good to see you, Bill.
Good to see you, Ghorm.
You know my orders?
Yeah.
Hottest potato
they ever handed me.
I don't envy you.
I suppose you were
prepared for it?
No. Not a hint of it.
I still can't believe it.
Neither can I.
What made them do it?
I haven't got your brains
nor your ability.
And after what
you've been through...
They'll never know
what we've been through
down here.
Well, maybe they just
wanted you to have a rest.
Lord knows you've earned it.
Come in.
Excuse me, sir.
I've finally contacted all
the key commanders about
your conference this evening.
General Vandergrift
is doubtful,
but the others can get away.
What time will
suit the Admiral?
Up to you, Bill.
Whatever you decide.
Admiral Halsey
will advise you later.
Aye, sir.
Ghorm, why is the Navy
taking such a licking
at Guadalcanal?
That's easy. Our people
are worn out with day
and night operations.
Our search planes didn't
see them coming and we
were taken by surprise.
Yamamoto's commanders
are better trained
for night fighting.
They employed
their torpedoes better.
But we're learning fast,
I plan to...
Let's get this change of
command over with.
Ask Admiral Halsey's Chief
of Staff and my Chief
of Staff to come in here.
Aye, sir.
I saw George Baker at Pearl.
How is he?
Oh, fine.
He told me he ran into
Joe Masefield
about a year ago.
Good. Bill,
what did I do wrong?
You didn't do anything wrong.
You just got here first.
And I'm going to get a lot
of the credit for many of
the things that you started.
Thanks.
We have five days.
Six at the most, before
Yamamoto's next big push.
My immediate handicap
is ignorance of the area.
I've never been
on Guadalcanal.
You know the problem.
You know what needs
to be done.
Do it. I'll back you.
And throw away the book.
The guy who wrote it
was never in this situation.
And one more thing,
forget whether
you're the Army,
Navy, Marine,
Australian,
New Zealand or British.
We'll operate as though
we are all in one uniform,
if I have to stencil
South Pacific Fighting Force
on the seat
of every man's pants.
Those of you wearing neckties
may begin by taking them off
because if you're as busy
as you're going to be,
or as you should be,
you won't have time
to put them on.
My cabin door
will always be open.
Good luck.
Captain Black,
will you see me
in my cabin in about
five minutes?
Sit down, Captain.
I'll be with you in a minute.
What's the beef,
Mr. Black?
I think Admiral Ghormley
got a bad deal.
For which you blame me.
I didn't say that, Admiral.
You didn't have to.
Now, if it's any
consolation,
I think Admiral Ghormley
did as good a job,
if not better,
than anybody else
could've done under
existing conditions.
It takes quite some time
to learn about conditions
down here, sir.
Yes, I'm sure it does.
And you're going to
educate me.
You want me to stay on?
Of course.
May I ask why, sir?
I'd be a fool not to take
advantage of your experience.
How do I get a quick
and accurate picture
of our situation
on Guadalcanal?
Talk to the key commanders.
Vandergrift, Geiger, Patch,
Carlson, Harmon, Turner.
How soon can
you get them here?
Do it.
Aye, aye, sir.
Good evening, sir.
Miss Young, sir, came aboard
on behalf of the Red Cross
Entertainment Committee.
She's making a survey
to see what the men
would enjoy the most.
I'm sure Commander Lowe
will have some
excellent suggestions.
Would you believe it,
sir?
Miss Young and I
grew up in the same town,
but never laid eyes
on each other until
five minutes ago.
About five minutes.
It is a small world.
Carry on.
Yes, sir.
Make yourselves
comfortable.
Sit anywhere.
Any of you gentlemen
need medication?
I could stand a taste.
I'll have some
coffee, Doc.
Thank you.
Flying Fortresses
HALSEY: How about you,
Colonel?
CARLSON: Sir?
The good doctor
has authorized
a combat ration.
Not unless you're
having something, sir.
I'm not eligible
aboard ship.
Maybe when I visit
your raiders
on Guadalcanal.
You'll be eligible,
sir.
General Vandergrift
and General Geiger,
sir.
Hello, sir.
Roy.
Admiral.
You all know
General Vandergrift
and General Geiger.
Gentlemen.
How are you, sir?
Sorry we're late,
sir.
We ran into
a little excitement
around takeoff time.
Yeah. Washing
Machine Charlie.
Have a seat.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Archie, how bad is it?
Whatever they've told you,
it's worse.
Mud, malaria, mosquitoes,
dengue fever, dysentery...
We're living on captured rice,
driving our trucks
on captured gas.
What are we short of?
Kelly Turner can tell you.
Ammunition, food, medicine,
tools, spare parts, pilots,
aircraft, ground troops...
Everything except Japs.
It's been that way
ever since we landed.
If you think the Navy's
been letting you down, Archie,
let's you and me trade places
for about 24 hours.
Maybe then
you'll get some idea...
How the hell I'm gonna give
more naval support
when I don't have the ships,
cargo or combat?
I just don't have the ships.
So we let the Tokyo Express
keep cruising down the Slot
every night pouring shells
onto Henderson Field.
We're down to just one carrier
in the whole South Pacific,
until the
gets back from Pearl.
Roy?
Maintenance in that mud
is a nightmare.
We're lucky to get up
six aircraft against 30.
Admiral, this morning
I had to kick,
literally kick
a couple of pilots awake
to drive them back
into their cockpits.
They were that beat.
Admiral, unless
the Navy shows
the flag up there soon,
I can't answer
for the outcome.
TURNER: How can we protect
transports in those
restricted waters?
I'd have to commit
what's left of my task force
and risk losing
the whole works.
Which is exactly the risk
I'm running right now.
And me.
Sir, the fact of the matter
is, we all share
General Vandergrift's feeling.
Everybody's asking,
"Where's the Navy?"
Anyone else care to speak?
You painted
a black picture, gentlemen.
It's black, all right,
but it can get
a hell of a lot blacker.
Less than a year ago we were
clobbered at Pearl Harbor
and they've been
pushing us back ever since.
Now, Guadalcanal is
the keystone of our defense.
If we lose Guadalcanal,
there'll be nothing
to stop them going all
the way down to Australia.
They'll cut
our lines of communication,
they'll cut
our lines of supply,
the war could be
prolonged for years. Or worse.
Guadalcanal is our
last chance.
I promise you
everything I've got.
The Navy will be there.
I'll get you more
air support
and I'll step up
your supplies.
But, Admiral, even if I could
scrape up enough supply ships,
every time there's an
air alert they have to
quit unloading and pull out.
Then we'll step up
the unloading.
Yes, sir.
All right.
Let's get down to cases.
OFFICER1: Goodnight, Colonel.
OFFICER 2: Goodnight, sir.
Goodnight, Admiral.
Thank you very much.
Admiral,
good luck.
Goodnight, Admiral.
Come and visit us.
Well, you sure
made them feel better.
Admiral, where you gonna get
all that stuff you promised?
I don't know.
Now, where can
I lay my hands
on some ground troops
and get them
to Guadalcanal?
I'm afraid the bottom
of the barrel has already
been scraped bare, sir,
by Admiral Ghormley.
Are you sure?
What about this proposed
airstrip at in the Dai,
and the Army ground troops
we're sending in to build it?
They're committed.
They're on their way.
Why can't we divert them
to the island, tonight?
But, Admiral,
there's a specific
directive.
But we are faced
with one hell
of an emergency.
The airstrip
isn't that essential.
It's 205 miles
closer to Henderson
than any we've got, sir.
So we increase
our air search area
But that does not save
Admiral, by the time
we went through channels
to try to change...
There won't be time
for channels.
I tell you,
unless we move now,
there won't be any need
for that airstrip.
And, Harry, there's only
one thing to do,
intercept those ground troops
and send them where
they'll do the most good.
And ignore
the directive?
We can argue with them later.
But, Admiral,
we can't do that.
I think we'd be entirely wrong
to take such a decision
into our own hands.
Is that your best judgment?
It's my frank opinion, sir.
Are you prepared
for the consequences?
I am, sir.
I mean the consequences
of losing Guadalcanal?
Or are you concerned with
repercussions from topside?
It isn't just a matter of
repercussions, sir,
I think it would be fairer
to say, that I believe
that these things
have to be
properly coordinated.
I'm afraid you'll have to
leave that one to me, Harry.
Issue the necessary orders,
and advise Harmon,
Patch and Vandergrift.
Aye, aye, sir.
Harry?
Sir.
Ask Pulaski
to come in, please.
Yes, sir.
MALE VOICE: You know,
I missed that shot.
Lieutenant Pulaski,
the Admiral wants
to see you.
Thank you.
Come in.
Have a seat, Mike.
Quite a bunch out there
still waiting to see you,
sir.
I know.
The pieces beginning to
fit together?
Little by little.
Mike, just how good
is our Intelligence?
Well, the Polynesians resent
the Japs, so they help us.
Missionaries
and Australian coast-watchers
in hiding
along the Solomon's chain
tip us to Jap ships coming
down the slot and air raids.
I've got two men with radios,
here on Rendova.
One in the Shortland's,
and several, here,
in the Russell's.
That's right under
the Japs' noses.
How do they evade
capture?
Some don't.
I see.
Mike, they tell me you're
an expert on the Orient.
Not an expert.
Spent some
years in Japan.
Speak the language,
know most of their
leaders personally.
Tojo, Nomura,
Admiral Yamamoto...
What can you tell me
about Yamamoto?
He's the best they've got.
A fine tactician,
a brilliant strategist,
he commands the
fanatical loyalty of his men.
I understand that
when his fliers
are downed in the water,
they don't even
expect to be picked up.
That's right, sir.
They know he won't
spare planes for rescue.
Nice, very nice.
If you'd like
a personal note, sir,
I can tell you
he's quite a poker player.
You've played with him?
Many times.
When he was naval attache
in Washington.
And he was rough?
Very.
Consistently overplayed
his hand and got away with it.
I hear that he's hot
for naval aviation
and carriers.
That's right, sir.
I guess you know
the part he
played at Pearl?
Just that he was there.
He was there all right.
We recently learned that
it was Yamamoto
who planned and directed
the attack on Pearl Harbor.
Actually Yamamoto
was against war
with the United States.
He predicted that in the end
Japan would lose.
However once the higher-ups
overruled him,
he threw himself
wholeheartedly
into the effort.
Pearl Harbor was
his first assignment.
And it could've been
my last assignment.
If it hadn't been
for engine trouble at sea,
I'd of been caught in
the harbor with the rest
of those poor devils.
Well, thanks, Mike.
It'll be your job from
now on to read
Yamamoto's mind for me.
I'll do my best, sir.
I'm sure you will.
Are your whizz kids
making any headway
with the Japanese code?
Some.
Light a fire under them,
will you?
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, sir.
Goodnight.
And send Andy in, please.
Yes, sir.
You wanted to see me,
sir?
Who else is waiting
out there?
Well, now, let me see.
There's that freighter
captain you sent for.
Three newspaper
correspondents,
a psychological
warfare officer...
A psychological
warfare officer
just in from the States.
Am I keeping you up?
No, sir.
Who else is there?
Doc Key for one.
He says if you don't
see him next, he's gonna
bust in here anyway.
Call him.
Yes, sir.
Doc, come on in.
Good evening, Doc.
Good morning might be
closer to it, sir.
Does the Admiral
realize he's been
cooped up in this office
seeing person after
person for 16
consecutive hours?
Is that a record?
No, sir,
it isn't a record,
if you'll pardon
my saying so,
it isn't very smart.
As your chief flight
surgeon, I must insist
that you get more rest.
They tell me there are
men on Guadalcanal
who haven't slept in days.
Yes, sir. But they're
not 60 years old,
and they're not fresh
out of a hospital.
Just give me
one more hour.
No, sir.
As long as I'm here,
there's something else
I might as well attend to.
What's that for?
What're you gonna do?
Your shots, sir.
What do I need
those for?
There's no telling
what you'll run
into on Guadalcanal.
How did you know
I was going up there?
I have friends
in high places.
You tell him?
No, sir.
You know me
better than that.
All right, if you'll just
roll up your sleeve, sir.
Now, wait a minute.
You put that ice pick away
and we'll make a deal.
We're not leaving
until tomorrow afternoon,
you can give me
the shots just
before lunch.
Oh, no.
I won't see
anybody else tonight.
I'll have Andy
clear off the office
and I'll go right to bed.
All right, sir.
It's a deal.
Andy, will you explain the
situation to the people
outside and turn in.
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, Admiral.
Goodnight.
I thought we were taking off
to Guadalcanal at dawn.
We are.
Well, you just told Doc...
Oh, now, sir,
that's real sneaky.
Goodnight, Andy.
All this fuss over a couple
of little bitty old shots.
Goodnight, Andy.
Goodnight, sir.
ANDY: The Admiral
isn't seeing
anybody else tonight.
Come in.
HARRY: Captain Black, sir.
What is it, Harry?
About the airstrip
matter, sir.
What about it?
Well, in view of
the position I took,
if a change in my assignment
would be for the best I...
Because you
bucked me on it?
Oh, that's part
of your job.
If we both thought
exactly alike,
I wouldn't need you.
Thank you, sir.
The orders have gone out,
sir.
Now we both better
jump to one side.
I think so, sir.
Welcome to
Guadalcanal, sir.
Thanks.
Captain Bailey.
You remember Andy Lowe?
How do you do?
Anyone else with you?
No. I left them all
on the
I brought you
four sacks of mail
and nine drums of
aviation gasoline instead.
No reflection on your staff,
Admiral, but you couldn't
have made a better switch.
Sergeant, a load
of gas drums
for you and mail.
Yes, sir.
Okay, you guys,
you heard the man.
Well, Admiral,
where can we
take you first?
I don't want to
tie you up.
Just give me a jeep
and a driver
who knows
his way around.
I'll be glad to
go with you.
No thanks.
I prefer to have
a look around
on my own,
while Captain Bailey
gets together with
you and your G-3.
All right, sir.
Lieutenant Ludlum.
Take the Admiral
anyplace he wants to go.
Yes, sir.
That's the Padre,
sir.
Padre?
Father Gehring,
Navy chaplain.
Could we give him a lift?
Of course.
Hey, Padre.
Welcome aboard,
Padre.
PADRE: Thank you, Admiral.
This is Andy Lowe.
Pleased to
meet you.
How do you do?
How far up are you going?
Maybe a mile, maybe less.
Depends on how things are.
How are things, Father?
Lousy, Admiral.
ERIC: That's the
Tenaru River.
We're here,
they're there.
Got it?
Got it.
Okay. So all night long
we're calling
back and forth,
"Tojo's for the birds.
Babe Ruth stinks."
I thought they'd
never stop coming.
Well, supposing
they'd come
around your flank
instead of coming
at you head on?
We wouldn't be here,
Admiral.
You know what I mean?
I know what you mean.
Okay, you guys,
let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Admiral Halsey,
this is Doc White.
How do you do, Admiral?
I'm pleased to meet you,
Dr. White.
You get on with your work.
Don't let me stop you.
Okay, Admiral.
Could you have dinner
with us at Headquarters
tonight, Father?
Well, thank you,
Admiral.
But I've already
promised the
boys of Company F
I'd have chow
with them.
Goodbye, sir.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Bye, Father.
God bless you.
I think he
meant that, Admiral.
He wouldn't know
how not to mean it.
Which one of you
is Joe Foss?
That's me, sir.
I've been hearing a lot of
good things about you.
Likewise, Admiral.
Last night's raid
cost us two destroyed,
seven damaged,
but not beyond repair.
How do you feel
about the Zeros?
Well, they've got
a definite edge
in a dogfight.
More maneuverable
and they out-climb us.
Well, you'll be getting the
new Corsairs within two weeks,
and I'll get the P-38's to
the Army as quickly as I can.
That should change
the picture considerably.
We can use a change,
Admiral.
You're doing better than
well with what you have.
But the new stuff should help.
Good to see you.
Thank you, sir.
How's it going?
Great. Just great.
And you can
quote me directly on that.
No sleep at night.
Japs coming in,
dropping bombs.
Nothing but mud.
Whoever dreamed
this one up
ought to be hung
from the nearest
palm tree by his thumbs.
If you mean
General Tojo,
I agree.
Be seeing you.
Yeah.
What did you say
your name was?
I didn't say.
But it's Lamphier.
Tom Lamphier.
Thanks. Say,
who the hell was that?
They say his
name is Halsey.
Halsey?
There's nothing wrong
with this chow.
The problem is quantity,
not quality.
Archie, I have an idea...
That his calling card?
There's not much
to worry about,
unless some of his
friends drop by later.
I hope not.
I could use some sleep.
Air raid, Admiral.
What's the procedure?
The nearest shelter
until the "All Clear."
And leave here
for a hole in the ground?
I recommend it.
HALSEY: Well, no thanks.
Suit yourself, Admiral.
MARINE: Sorry.
No more room here.
HALSEY: Sorry to come
barging in like this.
MARINE: Glad for
the company.
HALSEY: You got
a cigarette?
How long do
these things
usually go on?
An hour.
Sometimes two.
You're new, huh?
Yeah. New.
It's good to see you,
Archie.
Good to see you, Bill.
And you can count
on all the support
we can give,
as long as I have
one ship.
I know that.
And don't forget
your souvenir.
What's this?
They heard that
you were here, sir.
If you'd just say
a few words, they
would appreciate it.
But, my voice
won't carry that far.
Excuse me,
Admiral.
We have
a microphone, sir.
Nail it to that tree.
Yes, sir.
PULASKI: A patrol plane
has spotted an enemy fleet
sailing south from Truk,
four carriers,
four battleships,
eighteen cruisers.
In addition, we have coast
watcher reports of Japanese
transports and auxiliaries,
plus cruiser escort,
moving down the Slot
from Rabul.
Looks like
the start.
Yes, sir.
I don't get it.
How can Yamamoto
launch an attack
while we still have
land based air
on Guadalcanal?
He's anticipating.
By the time his fleet
moves down to this point,
he assumes
he'll have Henderson Field.
That means Vandergrift
can look forward
to increased pressure.
And we can look forward
to the 25th or the 26th
at the outside,
being Zero day.
What's the matter, Frank?
I guess I didn't expect
them to try anything
like this so soon.
Neither did I.
We have lost the initiative
for the moment,
but I propose to get it back.
The
and
the
will throw
the first punch.
Two carriers against
his whole fleet?
Umm-hmm.
That's it, exactly.
Don't forget,
he doesn't know where
our carriers are.
And the trick will be
to keep him guessing.
It could work.
If Kincaid and Murray
made a wide sweep
east of
the Santa Cruz Islands,
beyond their search range,
and then cut back in time,
our carriers could
hit them coming in.
Meanwhile we give
Guadalcanal close support
with our cruiser task force.
What do you think,
Mike?
One thing's sure,
Admiral.
He'll never expect
you to come out
looking for him.
There's an old saying,
"No Captain can do very wrong
if he places his ship
alongside that of an enemy."
Well, that'll
hold you
for six months.
Let me have
the alcohol,
will you?
Well, Andy,
looks like
you're next.
I want to see you,
Andy.
Yes, sir.
Well, as long as you're here,
sir, if you'll just
roll up your sleeve...
No, better set up
an appointment, Doc.
Some day when
I have more time.
Ah, come in when
you're through
here, Andy.
Yes, sir.
Come in, Andy.
Captain Bailey's
been given command
of the
And now he's trying
to steal a member
of my staff
for one of his fighter
squadron commanders,
you know anything about it?
No, sir.
You been doing
a little politicking?
Sir?
He asked for you
by name.
Oh, oh,
is that a fact?
Yes, that's a fact.
Well, sir,
I'd certainly
hate to leave you,
but if Captain Bailey
really needs me,
why I'm willing to go.
I'll bet you are,
I hear the big "E's"
gonna see action
in three days.
And if you're not
there, you're gonna
be heart-broken.
Yes, sir.
Well, you'll get
your crack
at combat, Andy.
But right now,
I don't think much
of your timing.
But, sir, what...
What purpose
do I serve here?
Well, unfortunately
I'm used to you.
Well, sir, if...
If that's all, I...
Oh, all right,
all right, all right,
on second thought,
you've been a pretty
sorry excuse for an aide,
so Captain Bailey
can have you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.
Go on,
get out of here.
Yes, sir.
Good night, sir.
Oh... Sir, I...
I wondered if...
If I could ask
a special favor.
Yes, sure, Andy.
Well, sir, I realize
I haven't been the world's
best aide, in many ways
I've slipped up on my duty,
but, sir, my conscience
would be a mite clearer
if I could leave here knowing
that I had at least performed
one part of my assignment.
What's that?
Well, sir,
it was my duty to see
that you got your shots.
Is this in the nature
of one last request?
Well, it's a...
All right.
Get Doc Key.
Yes, sir. Aye, aye, sir.
I'm going after Doc Key.
The Admiral's gonna
take his shots.
If anybody wants me,
I've gone for Doc Key.
The Admiral's gonna
take his shots.
The Admiral's gonna
take his shots.
I never saw so much
commotion about
a couple of shots.
Not just a couple,
Admiral. Five.
Five?
Five, sir.
Watch out for
the hook, sir.
Very funny. Very funny.
Here comes number 1.
DR. KEY: Now,
here comes number 2.
This'll be number three.
Fresh PBY contact,
sir.
They report one
large carrier
and six other vessels
on the same bearing.
Issue these orders
to all task force
commanders immediately.
Is this all, sir?
That's all.
Yes, sir.
Hornet.
Hornet
We lost the
They damaged
the
We lost 283 men,

Aircraft,
they lost a minimum
of a hundred.
Against that,
our carrier plane losses,
from all causes, were 74.
That it?
That's it, sir.
Any discussion?
Harry?
What's there to say,
sir?
We got the
short end
of the stick.
Tactically, yes.
Strategically, no.
But we lost
the
sir.
What was our objective?
To hang on to Guadalcanal.
I'm calling your attention
to the fact that the Marines
are still doing just that.
Yes, sir,
but the Japanese fleet
is still in the area.
We're wide open.
Harry's right, sir.
If they follow up today,
we have nothing
to stop them with.
Sir...
Go on.
I think it's up to
the Staff to recommend
emergency measures
in the event we're forced
to evacuate Guadalcanal.
You feel that way?
It's true
that if the Japs
follow up today,
and their fleet keeps
coming down the slot,
we can't stop them.
But I don't think
they'll do that.
With a hundred planes
and pilots lost,
the air groups
aboard those Jap carriers
have been cut to pieces.
And why should they
come further south
to place themselves
under land-based air attack?
And a second thing,
in our favor,
the record.
Ever since Pearl Harbor,
the Japs have
consistently failed
to follow up an advance.
I'm gambling that
they won't break the habit.
We could still arrange
evacuation measures
for insurance.
No. No.
If they pick up the hint
that we're even
contemplating evacuation,
they'll be down here
like vultures.
In other words,
we lash down
the safety valves.
We lash them down.
I want all the senior
commanders
of the services
to pool their
mechanics in an
emergency repair force
and work around the clock
to restore ship damage,
particularly the
Well, as far as
I'm concerned, gentlemen,
the battle was a stand-off.
Just when we needed one.
"A PBY contact at 1400
"reports the enemy fleet
in a general retirement
toward Truk."
Enterprise,
Hornet.
Howdy.
You Andy Lowe?
That's right.
I was told
to double up with you.
Oh, well,
glad to have you.
Whose bunk was that?
A fellow by the name
of Cerella.
Dead?
He's missing.
Same difference.
Well, now I wouldn't
say that.
Well, I would.
I guess you've got
quite a few extra bunks
on the
tonight.
Yeah, quite a few.
Did he have a family.
Huh?
The man who used
to bunk up there,
did he have a family?
No, no.
Do you mind
if I use your typewriter?
Help yourself.
I... I didn't get
your name.
Roy Webb.
Oh, yeah.
Aren't you
Squadron Commander
of the F-11?
I won't be
when I finish this.
I lost half my
squadron today.
One half of an
entire squadron.
Nine planes. Nine men.
Making out
a strike report?
No.
From the look on your face,
I figure it's no love letter.
I'm asking to be
relieved of command.
Oh, well,
sooner or later we all
need a rest from flying.
Well, I don't need
a rest from flying.
I'll fly combat
again tomorrow.
I just do not want
to command.
I lost some guys today.
We all did.
It wasn't your fault.
Now how can you tell?
You know, my mother
said to me once,
she said, "Never make
an important decision
when I was tired."
I found that to be
a good piece of advice.
I know what I'm doing.
The Big "E."
Yes, sir,
she brought us home.
We've fixed most of
the leaks
in the oil tanks,
but the damage
to the forward
elevator's pretty bad.
Admiral.
Andy.
How are you?
Very good, sir.
Good evening, sir.
Evening.
Congratulations
on those two Zeros.
Thank you.
He splashed
three of them, sir.
If you'll excuse me,
Admiral.
Certainly.
Keep after them, Bill.
Well, I hear your relief
is showing up.
Maybe you can tell me
something about
a Commander Roy Webb?
Oh, yes sir.
He's...
He's Squadron Commander
on the
Would he fit in?
Well, he'd make
an okay pilot for you, sir.
He's...
He's experienced,
he's available.
We need Squadron
Commanders.
Why is he available?
Well, right at this time,
the pilots on the
have no ship, sir.
They'll be reassigned,
though.
Andy, I'd like
a straight answer.
Well, the fact is,
Admiral, Webb asked
to be detached.
Said he was unfit
for command.
Come in.
Lieutenant Commander Webb
to see you, sir.
Send him in.
Webb?
Sir.
I need an aide
who can double
as my pilot.
Your name has been
submitted. How do you
feel about the job?
I'd be honored, sir.
Frankly, I think
I belong in combat.
Well, according to this,
you asked to be relieved.
Only from command, sir.
Not from combat.
I've looked at your record,
it's a good one.
Navy Cross.
Every job they gave you,
you did well.
What happened?
Sir, I just can't give
any more orders.
Well, you've been
cutting it all right.
As a Squadron Commander,
yes, sir.
Now I'm Senior.
The Air Group Commander
is in the hospital.
If he doesn't get well,
I'll be next in line
for his job.
You don't want
the responsibility?
No, sir.
That's normal.
Sir, I don't think
you have the whole...
Sit down.
I can think of
some wonderful speeches
I could make right now.
Probably have
both of us in tears.
But I just don't
have the time for
such performances.
Webb...
Where do you think our
group commanders come from?
I don't know, sir.
All I do know is that
I'm not the man for the job.
You think the job requires
a great man?
Yes, sir.
Well, I have news for you.
There aren't any great men.
There are just
great challenges
that ordinary men
like you and me
are forced
by circumstances to meet.
Now, you've proved
you can get the job done.
You're hooked
by your own record.
In short,
you don't have any choice.
Sir, I lost
nine planes yesterday.
I lost those same
nine planes
and 17 others to boot,
plus one destroyer,
two submarines
with all hands,
two LST's, and God knows
how many ground troops.
Do you want me to go on?
No, sir.
I guess I... I just had
the feeling I was alone.
You were,
and you will be.
Good luck, Roy.
Thank you, sir.
You better
step on it, Frank.
The boat's waiting
and the old man's
raring to go.
What do you mean?
It's your turn today,
I swam a mile
with him Tuesday.
It's Murphy's turn.
Murphy's pulling OD.
So that makes it
your turn.
Look, I'm still
waterlogged
from Tuesday.
The Chaplain's
right down the way.
Doc, couldn't you
take him today?
Well,
for a consideration.
Like a...
Like a pint
of scotch?
Like a fifth?
It's a deal.
Nice work, Doc.
Nice work.
Where's the old man?
Well, he's half way
to Japan the last time
I saw him
and still going
strong.
I said to him,
"Admiral, I think
we've gone far enough.
"I think it's time
we turned around
and went back."
He said, "Is that
a medical opinion?"
I said, "No, sir.
"It's just the opinion
of a drowning man."
Doc, I'll make
a deal with you.
You give me back
my fifth of Scotch,
I'll give you
some artificial
respiration.
He's coming in now.
Look at him
kick and splash.
I wouldn't be
surprised if
he's part walrus.
I'll tell you
one thing,
I go with him again,
it's gonna be in
a row boat.
Quitting so soon,
sir?
HALSEY: No.
Just coming in
for a new partner.
Nothing like a...
Like a good swim
for what ails you.
Eh, Doc?
A man can't be
forced to testify
against himself, sir.
Where's Andy?
Beach combing.
What do you bet
they both come
from his home town?
A beautiful day.
Clear sky.
Not a ship
on the horizon.
Almost make you forget
there's a war on.
Yes, sir.
How soon do you
think Yamamoto
will be back, Mike?
Two weeks, sir.
That's, uh,
Well, pull up
some chairs
and let's get to it.
Well, sir,
according to all
available information,
the situation on
Zero Day,
should shape up
as follows.
Kelly Turner's transports
should be finished
unloading by nightfall.
That will free
his escort
to move here
South of Savo Island,
to reinforce
Scott and Callaghan
if a night action
should develop.
Callaghan's cruiser force
and Scott's cruiser force
will be here.
Kincaid's force
of battleships
and heavy cruisers
will have escorted
the
to within
flying range of the enemy,
about a hundred
or so miles
to the south,
depending on
when the
is ready to sail.
I just talked to Bailey,
sir.
Repairs on
the
definitely
will not be
completed on time.
Then she'll have to
sail as is.
Half a carrier
is better than none.
HARRY: Admiral,
Frank has been going
round and round
with me on this,
he feels very
strongly that...
Sir...
Is the plan still open
for discussion?
Certainly.
Sir, following
the last engagement,
you correctly estimated
that their fleet
would withdraw.
The rest of us were
a little wrong
about that one.
This time we know
they're coming all the way.
And if we lose this one,
Guadalcanal is going
to be another Bataan.
Impossible to reinforce,
impossible to relieve.
Vandergrift will wind up
another Wainwright.
If we lose.
Well, before we send
Callaghan and Scott
into those narrow waters,
Admiral,
let's see what we've got.
Three cruisers,
a handful of destroyers.
Now, let's take a look at
what they've got.
The latest estimate
shows that they'll
have four battleships,
five heavy cruisers,
two carriers,
and about
The least we can do
is detach Lee's battleships
from the
and
send them on ahead to help.
The battleships will have to
protect our one carrier
till she gets within range.
I may detach them later.
Well, sir, how long can three
cruisers and a few destroyers
delay a force
more than twice their size?
Dan Callaghan
and Norm Scott...
Come in.
Admiral Callaghan
and Admiral Scott
are here, sir.
Send them in.
Aye, aye, sir.
Good evening, sir.
Dan. Norm.
You know
Harry Black?
Frank Enright.
Gentlemen.
Mike Pulaski.
How are you,
gentlemen?
I won't
keep you long.
I just wanted to
wish you good luck
before you shoved off.
We'll probably need
a little luck, sir.
Looks like
a real brawl.
I wish I could
change places
with you two.
We know you do,
sir.
I don't look for
a carrier action this time.
I think it'll be
a surface battle.
Guns and torpedoes.
Like Norm said,
a brawl.
And you can count on a real
loud rooting section up there.
Archie Vandergrift
and his Gyrenes.
Sir, we can't promise
Archie the Jap fleet
won't get through.
But if it does,
Norm and I guarantee
there won't be much left
afloat behind it.
Is that what you
had in mind, sir?
All I know is,
the job is in the right hands.
Thank you, sir.
BLACK: Goodbye, sir.
ENRIGHT: Good luck.
Good luck.
Goodnight, gentlemen.
Captain Black, sir?
No word?
No word.
Sir, there's something
I better tell you.
We've been waiting
for word on a float plane
overdue on a hop to Efate.
Your son is one
of the passengers.
HARRY: I'm going to
set up a special search.
No, no.
You will conduct
a routine search.
Thorough, but routine.
HARRY: Very well, sir.
Come in.
Sorry to disturb you, sir,
but I've got one or two...
All right,
let's have it, Harry.
These are for signature,
and this batch I thought
I could take care of myself
with one or two
exceptions.
Oh, Pearl has asked
for another report.
Any word?
No, sir.
No contact?
None reported, sir.
There should've been
a contact at 2300
if they'd maintained
course and speed.
Well, that last sighting
report may have been
inaccurate, sir.
We had trouble
with communications.
We were guessing
at some of the figures.
Harry, will you tell me
what the hell they want with
all these damn statistics?
Your signature goes
right there, sir.
Who has the duty
in the Com office?
Murphy's the
duty officer, sir.
And his orders are to get
all the dope up to us pronto.
One more, sir.
Thanks.
Is there any
hot coffee out there?
I'll send Manuel
right in, sir.
Thank you, Manuel.
The Admiral like
some cake?
No cake.
Manuel, why do you bother
with all this stuff
when you know
that all I want
is some black coffee.
The Admiral might
change his mind.
All right.
Sit down a minute,
will you, Harry?
Oh, Harry, you said
something this afternoon
about a dispatch from Pearl.
On the problem of
unloading.
What was that?
Oh, yes sir.
Here it is.
"Delay in unloading ships
at Noumea is alarming.
"It is noted that some ships
have been at Noumea harbor
"waiting to be unloaded
for three months.
"We unload ships
at San Francisco
"in three days."
Now that's mighty damn
smart of them.
You send them a message.
Tell them if they'll give us
the unloading facilities
they have at San Francisco,
we'll unload a ship
in one day.
Shall I hold that
until morning, sir?
No, send it.
The Admiral might
change his mind.
That's the second time
somebody has said that
to me tonight.
Change my mind.
Yeah, you're right,
I might do just that.
You don't change your mind,
although I know some minds
that could stand changing.
And I won't
exclude my own.
You change the direction
in which you're going.
You don't change your mind.
As you go along
and get higher up
in this organization
or any organization,
each time you change
direction you take more...
More people with you.
More of your fellow men.
It'd be a whole lot easier
if you could go alone,
wouldn't it, Harry?
Yes, sir.
But I...
I don't suppose
anybody ever goes
completely alone,
do you?
Sir?
There aren't very many things
you can really count on,
not really.
I recall a fellow,
end of a long life,
who said he learned
only three things.
He said,
"I believe it's better
to tell the truth than to lie.
"I believe it's better to know
than to be ignorant.
"I believe it's better
to be free
"than to be a slave."
Covers quite a bit at that,
doesn't it, Harry?
Contact, sir.
I don't know, sir.
He hasn't been seeing
anybody this morning.
Yes?
HARRY: Captain Black, sir.
Come in.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
May I offer my
personal condolences, sir,
on the deaths
of Admiral Scott,
Admiral Callaghan?
I know how close
they were to you,
and how much their
friendship meant to you.
Thank you, Harry.
I have a dispatch here
from General Vandergrift.
Read it.
"To Scott, Callaghan
and their men
goes our greatest homage.
"With magnificent courage
against seemingly
hopeless odds,
"they drove back
the hostile stroke
and made success possible.
"To them
the men of Guadalcanal
"lift their battered helmets
in deepest admiration."
That was nice
of Archie, very nice.
Yes, sir.
There's another
dispatch, sir.
Read it.
It's personal, sir.
They found him.
Yes, sir.
Coast Watchers located
your son and his crew
early this morning.
They're all well?
All well, sir.
I was just about
to write Mrs. Halsey.
I understand, sir.
I'm a lucky man.
Yes, sir. And the day
is still very young, sir.
Just one more.
They're giving me
another star.
Sets of four stars
are in short supply,
hereabouts, sir.
I had a machinist mate
fix up a homemade pair.
A machinist mate?
Yes, sir.
Well that's...
That's very nice.
Have we anybody from the staff
going back to the States soon?
Yes, I believe
Lieutenant Lockwood
is leaving tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Yes, sir.
Will you ask him
to do me a favor?
What's that, sir?
Will you ask him
to deliver these
personally
to Dan Callaghan's
widow?
Yes, sir.
And these
to Norm Scott's widow,
with the message,
that their husbands
earned me my new stars.
Yes, sir.
May I add
my warmest
congratulations, Admiral?
Not only on the promotion,
but on the turn of events
at Guadalcanal.
Even Frank Enright thinks
we may have them licked.
Yamamoto doesn't seem
to know
that he's licked.
The rest of their force
is continuing down
the Slot on schedule.
Herding 20 transports
loaded with
invasion troops.
According to the book,
we don't send battleships
into waters
as narrow as those,
especially at night.
Forget the book?
Forget the book.
Detach Admiral Lee's
force from the
and send it ahead tonight.
Yes, sir.
HALSEY: The
planes can
follow up tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
May I see the Admiral?
What is it, Mike?
We've broken
the Jap code.
Yes, sir.
That was intercepted
from the Shortlands area.
Yamamoto's plane
is due to land
at the Jap air base in Kahili
at 11:35 on the 18th.
We've hit the Jackpot.
You think so?
Admiral, this was
made to order.
That's what bothers me.
HARRY: Admiral Lee
has been notified, sir.
A chance to
get Yamamoto.
Not only Yamamoto
but his whole Staff.
About 750 miles.
That's out of range
for anything we've got,
but the Army P-38's
could make it.
We break the Jap code
at just the right minute.
Then this message falls
into our lap
at just the right minute.
How do we know
this isn't a trap?
We don't, sir.
On the other hand,
if it is a trap,
wouldn't they go
about it a little
more subtly?
Washington leaves that
up to you, sir.
Advise
Archie Vandergrift
and Geiger
I'm leaving
for Guadalcanal now.
Yes, sir.
I see no point,
none at all in
speculating about a trap.
If Yamamoto
doesn't show,
the P-38's will refuse
combat and hightail it.
The question is,
what's the best
plan of attack?
Well, sir, I don't think
that we should try
to get him in the air.
There's too many variables,
the weather conditions,
he may be late,
he may be early,
we might miss him.
How would you do it,
Andy?
Well, hit him
when he's most vulnerable.
After he's landed
on Ballale island,
he's scheduled
to take a sub chaser
from there to Buin.
ANDY: I say strafe him
when he's on the water.
What do you say, Lamphier?
Oh. Well,
no pun intended, sir,
but I think
that approach is all wet.
Could you be a little bit
more explicit, Captain?
Sure.
Now Army pilot's
are gonna carry the ball
in this thing, correct?
Well, I hate to
embarrass anybody,
but the plain fact is
that Army pilots,
including yours,
truly, are not so hot
on Naval identification.
Based on past performance
I'd say there's
a strong possibility
that we might
pick out something else
instead of the sub chaser.
Oh, now looky here...
I'm not through.
If we do strafe
the right boat,
we could miss Yamamoto,
or maybe just wound him.
And if we sink the boat,
what's the guarantee
that he won't swim away?
Well, there's no guarantee
that you're gonna get him
in the air, either.
Your way might work,
Andy, but...
I think the fellow
who has to do the job
should call the play.
We'll go for him in the air.
I counted
only 14, sir.
Must've been
some mechanical trouble.
Four of those P-38's
didn't get off.
Signal from
Admiral Lee, sir.
Lee's lost two destroyers,
but he sank the
The Japs have
reversed course.
Sounds like our chance
for a field day.
And we're gonna
make the most of it.
Clear the decks at
daybreak and go after
those two transports.
Yes, sir.
I want your B-17Ts
in on this.
Yes, sir.
And notify
the
I want her boys
in on this, too.
Yes, sir.
They're landing
and taking off again
as fast as they can
rearm and refuel.
It's becoming
a shuttle run.
The Jap escorts
are abandoning
the troop ships.
Well, from here on end
it'll be like shooting
fish in a barrel.
Keep pouring it on.
Yes, sir.
Roy.
General Geiger.
Sir?
Any word on the
Yamamoto thing?
Not yet, sir.
If Yamamoto was
on schedule,
they should have
intercepted him at 9:50.
That was
They'll have
to get well
out of the area
before they can break
radio silence
and report, Admiral.
I think it's
still a little
early for that.
Another flight back
from the transports.
Andy?
How is it?
Oh, we're rolling up
a big score.
Any word from
that bunch that you
sent after Yamamoto?
Not yet.
Andy, how many runs have you
made over those transports?
This next one
will be my fourth.
They got him, sir!
They got him!
Tom Lamphier got Yamamoto.
A confirmed kill.
Rex Barber splashed
the other Betty
carrying Yamamoto's staff.
Both aircraft.
Good works, Admiral,
a complete success.
What were our losses?
Four aircraft, sir.
How do I look?
Unusual, sir.
Well, I guess I better
get it over with.
Yes, sir.
Goodbye, Manuel.
Goodbye, sir.
Request permission
to leave the ship.
Request granted.
Hand salute.
