On
You boys understand
what's gonna happen here?
Same family killed your
brothers killed my pap.
Sooner or later, we're
gonna get every damn one.
We are not infidels
like the Hatfields.
How old was little
Sarah Elizabeth?
Oh, she was just shy of a year.
Lined with blue velvet.
Yeah.
Yeah, she'd like that.
It'll do, Mr. Goodpasture.
I'll give you some time.
- She'll rest easy in that.
- Yeah.
Poor little girl.
You think me
and Sarah Elizabeth
will recognize each other
when I get to heaven?
Oh, I expect your brothers
will take care of her.
You'll recognize them.
They done murder.
They might not get there.
We need to go.
It's ransom.
You sent for me?
Saddle the horses.
I got me a tip about...
Three good Christian Hatfields
we gonna apprehend.
We go now
across the river quick...
They won't have time to hide.
I'll round up the men
posthaste.
You coming?
He will be.
Come on!
The blood of the lamb
Are you fully trust
In his grace
This hour
Are you washed
Brother.
That's Tom Chambers.
Get him.
There he is.
Him too.
You can't do this.
Who's the next one?
What is this?
This is the house of God!
Ma'am.
Let's get out of here, boys.
Are you washed
in the blood?
In the soul
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
What's all the ruckus?
Folks are celebrating
Mr. Phillips' success.
He hasn't caught
Devil Anse yet.
He's poorly.
He got pleurisy.
Jim.
Ain't you a sorry sight.
Want I should come back later?
Speak your mind.
Phillips' gang raided
services at the tug fork church,
seized Tom Chambers
and the Mahon brothers,
smacked preacher Garrett
for no apparent reason.
Anse, they are shoving it
in our face.
Yeah.
Any word from your man
John B. Floyd?
Governor Windy
ain't doing shit,
too busy letting
lawyers get in his ear
and getting his back up against
these New York muckrakers
calling us
a "Savage Mountain Tribe."
It's up to us, like always.
What do you propose?
Cut off the head of the snake.
Be awful treacherous
going after Frank Phillips.
He's got an army around him.
No, he's...
he's the fangs.
We ought to kill Randall McCoy.
I'm attorney Perry Cline,
esquire.
I'll represent you till
the court deems it necessary
to appoint a public defender.
You think we got
a better chance
if we keep you on
as our lawyer?
Well, it's up to you.
I do know the circumstances of
the case better than anyone.
Now, these stamped envelopes are
to contact your family members
to assure them
you're being well-treated
and to arrange payment
of my retainer.
That's $50 cash
receivable at my office.
You killed my sons.
Your murdering sons.
Not guilty
till proved innocent,
men like you
who deserved a fair trial.
I pray you hang.
I will supply the lumber
for the gallows,
and I will tie the knot
on your rope.
And when your neck snaps,
I will rejoice
as you are sent to boil
in eternal damnation's hellfire!
A Merry Christmas to you,
too, sir.
You all right, ma?
You hear that?
Hear what?
Shh.
They'll come from over there.
Who will?
Hatfields, they'll come
from over there.
Hatfields?
Ma, Hatfields are hiding out
from bad Frank.
They ain't gonna come across
this side of the river.
Let's go inside, huh?
No one's coming tonight.
It's not tonight I speak of.
We're hunted like animals
by hired trash.
Family and friends kidnapped
and murdered.
The law stood by.
The law has done nothing.
Even so, if there was anything...
anything I had that,
by giving it,
I could end
this bloody struggle,
I would give it gladly.
I'd give my life
if it would end this.
You would not.
What I will not give
is one more drop
of this family's blood.
So tonight,
this new year's Eve,
we end this forever.
I's with you, Mr. Hatfield.
You ain't coming, Billy.
You ain't ready.
Thank the stars
I ain't too late.
Lots of time, Johnse.
We all just waiting for your pa
to finish his coughing fit.
We can be there by dawn,
make our approach with the sun
at our backs.
The time of the morning,
the day it is,
they won't expect nothing.
We harm no one we don't have to.
Once Randall sees how it is,
he'll surrender himself
to protect the others from harm.
We take him alive.
Thought we was
getting rid of him.
Once Randall McCoy's
extradited,
as our prisoner of war, we...
we execute him here
in West Virginia,
the state where he committed
his crimes.
As is proper.
A mite dizzy.
Stepped on a stone
or something.
Yeah, I know.
We still got to get you
to the doc.
No, there's no time.
You're too sick, pa.
Well, we can do this.
Damn.
Anse.
Be a worthless trip
if you start coughing like that
and give us all away.
No one but Randall taken
and him not harmed.
Him not harmed,
or you answer to me.
All right, y'all.
Saddle up.
You're gonna beat it, Anse.
And we'll get Randall.
Randall, wake up.
They're here.
Shh.
What is it, poppy?
Get them children down.
Get down.
Go.
May hell be my heaven,
I will kill any man
who goes back on me
if powder will burn.
All right, as planned.
Go on now.
Go on.
You know, pa said just Randall.
We take him back over the tug
to West Virginia?
You think Randall McCoy's
gonna let himself
get took alive?
We got to try.
Randall McCoy!
Your final day has dawned.
Save your family.
Surrender yourself.
You hear me?
Your final day has dawned.
Uncle Jim!
Jim.
We got all sides covered now,
every door, window, and rathole.
Ain't nobody gonna get out
without us seeing them.
Who's got the back?
Cotton Top.
Johnse's with him.
I'll go check them out.
We got your whole farm
surrounded, McCoy.
Might as well come on out.
Do it now,
and we spare your family!
I seen that Jim Vance.
Cap Hatfield and the others
are out of sight taking cover.
How many?
Come on.
Come on.
Get behind and sit.
You too.
Don't shoot unless they do
or someone charges.
I can't get a good shot
no ways.
Shh.
Shh.
Sorry.
I got this tune
stuck in my head.
Where's Johnse?
He said to watch the back
is all I know.
Don't let no one out.
Watch the back.
Randall McCoy, come on out
and face the day,
or else I have to burn
your house down.
You want your little ones
consumed in fire?
We're all right.
Don't worry.
Their wee bodies a-hissing
and a-steaming?
Randall!
Go out the back,
and run for the woods.
I got to go out there.
If I can get a showdown
with Jim Vance,
maybe the others will
back down.
Randall, he'll shoot you down
like you was nothing.
I'm begging you, husband,
slip out the back while you can.
If they know you're gone,
they'll leave us be.
Cotton Top, what's that?
Hold your fire!
Get down!
Get down!
Hold on!
God damn it!
I didn't order yet!
Hold on!
I said, hold your fire!
What the hell?
Cotton started shooting.
Must have seen McCoy
stick his head out.
Go find out.
Hey, my pa's not here!
He stayed over in Pikeville
last night!
I said for him to come out!
He's not here!
Ain't nobody in here but me,
except women and childrens.
Randall!
We're all waiting for you.
He's not here!
Heavenly father,
spare my family,
and smite my enemy.
I beg of you, have mercy
in our hour of need.
Have mercy, lord Jesus.
He
cotton, we said,
"Let nobody out the back."
Nobody out the back!
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Discourtesy is what it is.
You son of a bitch!
We got to get the fires out.
We need more water.
Use the buttermilk.
You're burning women
and children, you coward!
What kind of devil are you,
Jim Vance?
Alifair!
Now, you listen to me.
You get ma and the kids out
the back, all right?
Mama, come on.
Let's go.
Go on.
Get them out.
Mind the babies, Alifair.
I'll be along.
Ma.
Go, go, go!
Don't stop.
Go on.
Go on, Fanny.
You got to go back inside.
- Keep going.
- Get back inside!
It ain't allowed.
I let them...
I let them out the back.
You got one.
That's good enough.
They ain't allowed.
I want Randall McCoy!
Well, you got his son!
Poppy.
Poppy.
Hey.
Fanny.
Where's your mother?
Alifair got hurt.
Hold your fire.
What the hell are you doing?
Crazy stupid bitch.
I was having a dream,
and Sally said, "They're here."
I heard Jim Vance yelling,
"Randall McCoy, come out
and face the day!"
And it was me they was after.
Can you lean your head back?
I need to look in your eye.
I told Sally,
"I got to go out there."
She said, "You do,
they'll kill you.
"Try and get out the back.
Me and the children,
we'll be safe when you're gone."
Safe.
It's gonna be all right.
- I want my Rosie.
- I know, sweetheart.
I lit out
and made for the woods.
Then I heard the shooting.
After a while, I seen the smoke.
Then I saw the children.
The children told me Alifair was
leading them away from the fire
when they shot her.
I took them deeper in the woods.
We knelt, and we prayed.
When I got back, they was gone.
Mr. Phillips.
You got to see this.
Sally was laying on
the ground next to Calvin.
I picked her up,
and I held her in my arms
for I don't know how long.
And when I next looked up,
you was here.
Your son Jim is on his way
to get the kids.
You and Miss McCoy will stay
at my house.
I prayed to a merciful God
who showed us no mercy.
His will, Randall, not ours
be done.
This is his will?
My children dead, my wife hurt,
and my house burned?
Where was God?
If this is his will,
what kind of God is that?
What kind of God is that?
It's the other McCoy girl.
Looks like she's seen the devil.
Whatever we want now.
Rules are done.
Hey, Charles.
Oh.
What?
You know, looking at this
family peacefully feeding
reminds a body
of why we kill McCoys.
Sit down.
Sit down.
It didn't turn out so well.
Tell me.
That goddamn half-wit
cotton turd.
Hey.
Oh, this probably ain't fit
for the ears of young 'uns.
Go wash.
Take your brothers.
Let's go.
Go.
Shut the door behind you.
Just say it.
Our foray against
old Randall was interfered with
by family members.
While old Randall was running
scared like a jackrabbit,
his heir Calvin...
Come charging us,
shooting with deadly intent.
I had no choice but to kill him.
You said "family."
Ah.
One of old Randall's older
daughters, um...
She got in the way
and got killed accidental.
There may have been others.
We tried to burn them out.
And all unforeseen, Anse.
But you know your boy, Cap?
He done good now.
And Randall got away.
Yup.
And what of Randall's wife?
She run mad,
barreled straight at me
in her dishabille.
And?
And I...
I laid her in the back
of the ear
with my rifle butt.
I believe she's done.
What we do now, Jim?
Hmm?
Kill them all?
Reverend.
What is it?
Ma'am, I have
some terrible news.
Couldn't tell me what you
and your butchering family
did this time, could you?
Could you?
God damn it, stop it!
Horrible!
Horrible!
Just horrible!
How could any man
on God's green earth
do something so horrible?
It wasn't me!
How?
God damn it.
Uncle Jim and them
was trying to get rid
of Randall McCoy
so all this fighting
gets stopped.
Their intentions was right.
Oh, their intentions.
Like you wasn't a part of it?
Even if I was there
don't mean I participated
in any killing.
Hell, like people said I was
in that firing squad
that killed Tolbert and...
Oh, firing squad?
Everybody knows!
I raised my gun.
I missed on purpose.
Last night was no different.
You were there.
So you helped Jim Vance
murder my entire family?
Oh, hell no, I didn't.
You know, it made me sick.
Hell, if I knew
they was gonna do such,
I'd have never gone.
It was that weak-brained
Cotton Top shot Alifair.
That Jim Vance is
celebrating now.
Oh, hell no, he ain't.
Pa sent him and Cap over Thacker
mountain to lay low awhile.
They's a-hunting deer up
big Muncey Creek,
tryin' to put food
on the goddamn table,
'cause our family
can't even go to a store
without some McCoy
bounty hunter ambushing us.
Come on.
Hey, hey.
You know what,
let's pack the hell up.
Let's pack the hell up.
Let's...
let's go west, just get...
get away from all this
grief and misery.
It's tearing us apart.
Go away with me, Nance.
Let's go.
Let's go.
I'll be in Pikeville
with a real man.
Me and Frank Phillips,
we're getting married.
T.C. Crawford
from
I have a few questions about
the origin of this feud.
No feud,
not from how I see it.
Well, how would you
describe it, sir?
A many-year campaign of
swindling and murdering
against my family.
By Anse Hatfield and his clan?
Devil Anse Hatfield.
Well, governor Wilson
of West Virginia has said
the men arrested
for your sons' murders
were taken illegally.
There was an error
of paperwork.
Our courts will adjudicate it.
My house burnin'
was no paper error.
No court can resolve
my daughter, my son shot dead,
my wife so grievously injured,
atrocities that a just God
would not allow!
May we take a photograph, sir?
Your weapon.
I want you to hold it, please.
Our readers will really
appreciate this.
Just hold the gun up
a little bit higher.
It's all right, Randall.
Shows we're serious
about justice.
You look righteous, sir.
There's going to be a flash.
Sally, you still getting them
headaches?
You all right?
Hey, mama.
Hey, it's Roseanna.
- Rosie?
- Yeah.
Anything you need?
She... she's all right.
Oh, mama.
I know where you can find
Jim Vance.
Yeah?
Tell me about it.
Uhhuh.
Don't alter your pace.
Don't look about.
There's men concealed
in them trees up ahead of us.
Who is it?
Phillips?
Most likely.
Should have killed that goddamn
fox years ago.
Look here, Cap.
When all this starts,
you not being dead,
you break downhill.
You understand, son?
Yes, sir.
Skedaddle.
Ah!
Stay down, Jim!
Run, Cap!
Run!
No sense in both of us eatin'
these bastards' bullets!
Ah!
Jim!
God damn it, boy!
I said, get!
Or else I'll come back from hell
and tan your hide!
Jim!
Give me that damn rifle.
Ah, shit.
Son of a bitch.
Leave him be!
He's mine!
Oh.
I'm terrible sorry,
howls junior.
So sorry.
I do believe this is
the end of the line.
I'll be right behind you, boy.
Right behind you.
Don't shoot.
Not yet.
Time to meet your maker.
Which way you gonna go,
uncle Jim?
Got my damn boots all dusty.
It's Cap!
He's hurt!
Mr. Hatfield.
Mr. Hatfield.
Mr. Hatfield.
Cap got shot.
Lord Jesus, what happened?
Get away from him.
- Posse got uncle Jim.
- All right.
Bad Frank shot him
in an ambush.
Killed his dog.
Guy shot me,
there ain't no lead in there,
mama.
All right.
All right.
I'm all right.
You said they got Jim?
Where is he?
Where is he, Cap?
I'm sorry.
They...
he's dead, pa.
They took his body.
All right.
All right.
All right.
- I'm sorry.
- Uncle Jim.
I'm sorry.
Where's Johnse at?
He at his cabin?
Bad Frank is gonna probably
hit him next.
I'll get some boys
to ride by Johnse,
make sure he's all right.
Take him to the stream
to wash off that blood and dirt.
I'll get some tincture
and bandages.
How'd they know
where we was, pa?
Huh?
Your snoring used to
keep me awake.
Now it's the silence.
My mind won't rest.
You thinking about uncle Jim?
I always thought someday
I'd have to...
have to kill him myself.
Well...
It's a miracle
Cap wasn't killed too.
Only two people knew
where Jim and Cap had gone,
where they'd be that day.
Who?
Me...
And Johnse.
How do you know that?
Anybody could have
said something.
I know.
No, Cap or Jim...
I know.
I know, 'cause I made sure.
Johnse's no Judas.
No, he's not,
but people died, Levicy.
Well, you can't say you
didn't have a part in that?
And that
I'll have to live with,
but we both know our boy's
not a careful person,
especially around women.
What do you intend to do?
Get some sleep.
Anderson?
You should too.
Good boy.
Hey, daddy.
How long you been
standing there?
A while.
Where were you the other day?
Oh, I was up in
Boone county making a delivery,
you know.
You, uh...
You going to work this morning?
Thought you and me
might go fishing.
Today?
When you finish there,
saddle my horse.
All right.
What are you doing?
Me and Johnse
are gonna have a talk.
I have to know what that means.
You think I mean him harm?
I need to hear otherwise.
I will hear you say it.
I'm taking him fishing, Levicy.
So long, big brother.
You sure you don't
want to fish?
I'm going to.
You remember the last time
you brought me out
to this old fishing hole?
I don't recall that.
I do.
I know, 'cause I was in that
willow tree over there
up in that limb.
You recall what you said to me?
I do.
You said if I fell in,
I was gonna scare the fish.
And once I was in,
chances of you getting me out
weren't good on account
that you were not partial
to cold water.
You recall having said that?
Well, I believe I just coaxed
a laugh out of you, pa.
God damn, I don't remember
the last time I seen that.
It's too bad about
you and the McCoy girl.
Which one?
The one that ran off
with the man
that killed your uncle Jim.
You recall pretty good, Johnse.
Anything you want to say to me?
I know I shouldn't have trusted her.
I know that for damn sure.
You know, I hate all this.
I always have.
I think all I ever wanted to do
was play,
just laugh and play.
Yeah, it seems like nobody
around here ever laughs anymore,
except maybe when a McCoy
gets maimed or killed.
You know, that must be a trial
for you, daddy,
me not being like you.
You are who you are, Johnse.
No, what I mean is,
everybody looks up to you,
I mean,
even your older brothers.
No, there ain't...
there ain't nobody
looking up to me.
Hell, there are those that say
Cotton Top's of more use.
I don't know
how to be in this family.
I mean, I got...
I got all the memories,
you know?
I know all that's happened.
I just...
I don't have the hate that comes
with being a Hatfield.
You know, I look up
at that sky, pa,
and those clouds going by.
I'm telling you,
I know they're headed
somewhere different
than what we got here.
I seen these pictures
and these stories about Oregon.
Man, they got these millions
of trees to be logged,
I mean, even more than here,
wild rivers with fish long
as your arm,
no McCoys to shoot at
or get shot by.
That's heaven on earth.
That's what that is.
That's where I aim to go.
You won't outrun yourself
in Oregon, Johnse.
Can I ask you a question?
If I would have
fell in that day,
scared those fish...
Would you have let me drown?
That's a big old bear.
Johnse bagged him
when he come up behind us.
I never seen him.
That boy always did have
quick reflexes.
He's just...
Too damn handsome
for his own good.
Though, he's a lot like
his daddy,
except for the handsome part.
Boy's nothing like me.
What brings you out
this frosty morn?
Well, I got news
about our appeal.
Governor Windy's taking it
all the way
to the United States
supreme court.
Now we gonna be in the lawbooks,
maybe.
Get our boys out of jail,
back in their homes
where they belong.
Anybody who knows anything about
jurisprudence
says there ain't no doubt.
Only one thing gonna
resolve this, big brother.
And it ain't miss jurisprudence.
I don't know what you're
planning here, Anse,
but all this damn bloodshed
and killing's got to stop.
Uncle Jim was the last straw.
I'm turning myself in.
You insane?
Them blaggard's will shoot
you down.
I already sent word
to Perry Cline.
Perry Cline.
You think that skunk
will keep his word?
It's done, Anse.
I'm gonna fight this thing
the best way I know how.
I'm gonna fight it
in the courtroom.
In a Kentucky courtroom.
But not with a damn gun.
Well, guns never
failed me, wall,
not like judges and lawyers.
Well, it's gonna be the way
it's always been
between you and me,
little brother.
You gonna handle things your way,
and I'm gonna do them my way.
Wall, I never told you about
something I said to Ellison.
May be the last thing
he remembered, maybe not,
but it's haunted me ever since.
So right now, I don't want to...
Right now, I don't want to
say something to you
I'm gonna regret.
You ain't got no call
to worry about that, Anse.
Hey.
I'll be seeing you right after
I meet miss jurisprudence.
Ha!
Come on.
Get over here.
My name is
justice wall Hatfield.
I've surrendered myself
on a Kentucky warrant
for due process of the law.
Hatfield, you're under arrest.
I'm turning myself in,
Phillips.
You'll collect no bounty on me.
Give me some of that,
pretty lady.
I ain't gonna do that.
No, not now.
Hey, hey, you mind if I borrow
my boss from you, ma'am?
Says Hatfield's getting ready
for war again,
buying every hardware store
in three states
out of guns and ammo.
Hillbilly dirt rag.
Means nothing.
You need a drink.
Mr. Cline,
what's your pleasure?
Already got a fine libation.
I understand we're
celebrating more
than the capture
of wall Hatfield.
Meet Miss Frank Phillips.
Congratulations.
Mr. Phillips?
Mr. Phillips?
A mob of Hatfields is forming
over at mate creek,
Devil Anse himself at the lead.
Looks like they're a-fixing
to ride this way.
Hatfield's busting his
relatives out of jail.
We got to stop him, Frank.
Round up the deputies.
Enlist every able-bodied man
you can.
Yes, sir.
Come on.
Come on.
About time I see Devil Anse.
We got this, Mr. Cline.
We got this.
Kill them.
Yes, ma'am.
Every single one.
All right, let's go.
Come on.
The law be damned.
Hatfield be damned!
God be damned!
Damn you all to perdition!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hatfield!
McCoy!
Hatfield!
Fire!
Hatfield!
Get your old man back.
He's gonna be
the first one killed.
Yeah!
You trying to
get yourself killed?
Leave me be!
Kill them all!
Kill them all!
Go.
Shoo!
Go!
You all right there, pop?
Yeah, go on.
Damn it.
God damn it!
Here!
He's here!
Come back and fight!
Ah!
Billy.
Find cover, and stay put.
It's a trap!
It's a...
Hey, get back!
Get everybody back
to the horses!
Anse.
We got to get out of here, Anse.
They're flanking us
on both sides.
Mama.
Ah, son.
Cap!
Cap!
What?
Pass the word.
We're pulling out.
Move!
Joe!
Help me here with Billy.
I'm taking him home to his mama.
They're quitting the field.
Let's go.
Back!
Oh, call out to him.
When he stands up,
I'll blow his head off.
Hold off!
We got us a prisoner.
They don't.
I give up!
Means we won the day.
Go get him!
We won.
I won.
Bless the baby Jesus.
You all right?
Come on.
Move!
Stand up.
Come on, get!
Just a few steps more.
Doctor said it was good for you
to walk.
The room is not right.
I know, mama.
It's Perry Cline's house.
That's why it looks different.
Here.
I don't like Perry Cline.
I know, mama.
After I die,
I would like my body
destroyed by electricity.
Can you remember that, Roseanna?
Yes, mama.
I don't like Perry Cline.
I know, mama.
Uncle Randall?
Uncle Randall, we're here.
The hell are you doing here?
Frank Phillips asked me to
take you to Mr. Cline's house.
You disgust me.
How's your mother, Roseanna?
She's, uh...
She's better in some ways.
She's not right yet.
I hear tell
you're sick as well.
We was friends, Nancy.
Why'd you hurt me
the way you did?
You hurt yourself
taking up with Johnse.
Me marrying him just saved you
a whole lot of pain.
You love him?
I never did.
I hate him, just like
all the demon Hatfields.
Me and Johnse was never nothing
against you.
It's just plain old revenge.
I swore to killing Hatfields
when I was young.
Revenge is all I got
inside of me.
Yah.
Good news, judge.
The supreme court has ruled,
incorrectly, I believe,
that taking you people
without West Virginia's consent
was illegal.
So we going free?
Well, you hear that?
We're going free!
Selkirk.
A lawyer's smile
promises more to come.
Court also ruled...
properly this time...
that since you're
already in Kentucky,
as long as you're
legally rearrested,
you can be brought to trial.
Mr. Phillips?
Gentlemen,
y'all are under arrest.
It's your daughter Roseanna.
I'm coming up behind you.
I'm standing next to you.
You see me, poppy?
You hear my voice?
I hear you.
Dead children,
a dead grandchild,
a mad wife.
Anybody'd think you'd embrace
a still-living daughter.
When I was a little girl,
you once told me
I was your favorite.
I lived on that for years.
Just that tiny bit of approval
made me believe
I could do
anything in this world.
'Cause for all your preaching
and all your praying...
In our house, you were God.
Here.
Let me take that for you.
You're looking
particularly pale today.
Are you well?
Yeah.
Thanks for asking.
Roseanna.
You know my...
my offer of years ago...
It still stands.
Oh, Perry.
You don't want me.
I'm all used up.
Don't say that.
I do want you.
I just want to make you happy...
Yeah.
And take care of you.
I should probably just
do these dishes up.
I've always loved you.
Roseanna.
Roseanna!
Roseanna!
Randall!
Doc!
Roseanna, she's not...
she's not moving!
She just fell!
I don't understand!
Randall, get in here!
Oh, my God!
Roseanna, can you hear me?
Oh, my God.
She's bleeding!
She's bleeding!
What's wrong with her?
There, there, mother.
It'll be fine, just fine.
Doc rutherford says there's
a hospital in Lexington
that can help you.
You must let your heart break.
Only when the most innocent
part of you suffers
can there be change.
Else nothing remains of you.
Is she able to talk today,
Randall?
She speaks, but her words
carry no meaning.
An improvement on all her
wailing and rabbit noises.
You're not sending me away
to get better.
You're sending me away so you
can go to hell with Perry Cline.
Yah.
Is it true that I murdered
her in the first degree?
Alifair McCoy,
you murdered her.
Did anyone tell you to say this?
You said to say
that no one did.
You mean no one told you
to say anything?
Only that I murdered her
in the first degree.
I beg the court.
My client's nothing but
a poor, simpleminded fool.
Born that way.
Now, he admits his guilt
and throws himself
on the mercy of the court.
Wall Hatfield,
life in prison.
Selkirk McCoy,
life in prison.
Alex Messer,
life in prison.
"Cotton Top" Ellison Mounts,
death by hanging.
That's fine.
'Cause Devil Anse, Cap,
and all of them
gonna come at midnight
all armed and terrible,
riding dark horses
with lightning hooves
that don't never die.
They won't let me hang.
I'm letting him out.
Give me the keys.
I'm letting him out.
The only Hatfield
they're hanging
is the one
that don't deserve it.
It's bad luck to hang a...
it's bad luck to hang
a half-wit.
No, that's an old wives'
tale, Randall.
Where is my justice?
Where is it?
You know, you need to go home
and sober up some.
You
you get to live...
While my sons, my daughter
rot in their graves.
I might as well
let you out too.
Give me the goddamn keys.
Get him out of here.
Was there a point
where one of us
could have gave way
to stop all this nonsense?
I guess you can
contemplate that.
You still got something left.
What do you want, Randall?
Hmm?
What do you want
out of this life?
Just get through it.
If ever two men misunderstood
each other,
it was us.
So when does it end?
When there's no blood left
to be spilled.
That way don't work, Randall.
We tried that way.
I figure we go
in the dead of night
when the fog is thickest.
Get five men blazing away
in the north end
causing commotion
like Pikeville had never seen.
And we charge that jail with
everybody else...
Nobody's busting anybody
out of jail.
What?
Uncle wall, your big brother,
got life for doing nothing.
Wall wouldn't go anyways.
He's fighting it with appeals.
Still thinks
he'll get out legal.
What about Cotton Top?
We're telling every goddamn
newspaper in the country
we're coming for him.
When Cotton Top's hanged,
it'll take away
the McCoy bloodlust.
When he's hanged?
So cotton's our Judas goat?
Somebody's got to bend
to stop it.
Randall can't, so...
It's got to be me.
Pa, you... you done enough.
It's time I take over.
I don't want that for you.
Weren't you listening to me?
Cap, you gonna... you gonna
have children one day,
and your children,
they're not gonna care
about our old grudges
and slights from long ago.
And their children...
Hell, their children won't even
know about it.
It's time for us
to move on, son.
Oh.
Damn.
Damn it.
Levicy, you all right?
I miss Johnse.
I miss our son.
I sometimes wonder how different
things might have turned out
had I allowed him
to marry the first one.
Well, Roseanna was a McCoy.
We had to do
what we thought was right.
Let me see.
Let me see.
Ow!
Let's get out of here!
Got to get this thing over with
before we go to war again.
Tell me again,
what's so important
we had to dress up the girls
and bring them all the way here
for something
you can hardly see?
This is history.
Hatfields and McCoys are famous.
Famous for what?
Killing each other.
Come here.
Let's gather over here.
Most of you
have done some trapping
and, on occasion,
found a winter fox
that's left his leg
behind him in the trap.
So it is with us
on this difficult day.
Leave our leg behind,
or die in the trap.
Got a letter here that we're
gonna send to the newspapers.
I wanted you to all
hear it first.
"I do not...
"I do not wish to keep
the old feud alive."
"I suppose everybody,
like myself,
"is tired of the names
'Hatfield' and 'McCoy'
"and border warfare in a time
of peace.
"The war spirit in me
has abated.
"And I sincerely rejoice
at the prospect of peace.
"I've devoted my life to arms,
"and we have undergone
a fearful loss
"of Noble lives
and valuable property
in this hateful struggle."
The Hatfields made me do it.
They hornswoggled me with love.
"We, being like Adam,
"are not
the first transgressors.
And I propose to rest
in the spirit of peace."
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Obliged.
Sheriff, my name is Alexander.
I'm a big fan of yours.
Alexander?
Well, thank you, son.
"Bad Frank" there, right there.
Congratulations, Frank.
I read it.
It's...
Well, I, too,
am to be congratulated.
Meet Miss Carolyne Roes,
of the Roes of Lexington.
She's my fiancee.
They own half the county
and quite a stable
of fine racehorses.
You like them young,
don't you, Cline?
You cradle-robbing snake.
She ain't no drunkard,
and this laughable pack of lies
ain't nothing
but a waste of cheap paper.
You son of a bitch!
Come on!
Any time!
Boss, come on!
Get out of here!
Boss?
Boss?
I shall miss him.
Bad Frank could kill Hatfields
like no one else!
I'm coming after you,
Devil Anse!
You hear me?
You hear me?
I'm coming to hell after you!
Gather at the river
Where bright angel feet
Have trod
I baptize you in the name
of the father, the son,
and the holy spirit.
Amen.
Gather at the river
The beautiful
The beautiful river
Gather we the saints
At the river
That flows by the throne
Of God
