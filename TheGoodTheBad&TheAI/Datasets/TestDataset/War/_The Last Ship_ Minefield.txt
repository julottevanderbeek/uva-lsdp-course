General Quarters, General Quarters,
mines in the water.
Set Condition Zebra... all decks.
- Disengage shafts.
- Man: Disengage on.
No turns port and
starboard. Rig for Quiet One.
Alisha: Mines in the water.
All hands, rig for Quiet One.
The reason for General
Quarters is mines in the water.
Secure all spaces, Set Condition Zebra.
Michener: My fellow
Americans, 30 minutes ago,
I gave the order to begin the evacuation
of all United States Naval forces
from our Base in Uruma, Okinawa.
What's left of the Pacific Fleet...
two ships... is currently heading east,
en route to their agreed
position in Pearl Harbor.
Shut down long-range sonar.
- Shine Kingfisher.
- Man: Shining Kingfisher.
Whose water is this?
Whose been out here?
This is disputed territory.
There's three nations,
several non-governmental
actors currently vying for...
Why are you turning off
sonar if there are mines around?
Long-range sonar's what
set off that explosion.
Kingfisher's lower power
will still give us a
picture of the minefield.
Efforts are currently being made
to negotiate for the
release of the hostages,
both directly with the parties involved
and through our allies in the region.
The nature of these details must
and will remain classified.
I've got Kingfisher on this screen, sir.
There's got to be dozens
of them out there, sir.
TAO, you seeing what I'm seeing?
I count 96, sir.
I ask for all Americans to maintain faith
with their government
in this time of crisis,
while we keep our service
people in our prayers and thoughts.
Thank you.
No questions at this point, but I will
keep you informed as things progress.
Jacob: How do we
know this is the whole story
when your administration has
been keeping information
from the public ever
since Chandler left for Asia?
Sets of three, and
they're very close, sir.
Sir, I've calculated every
available path for us, sir.
We're surrounded. There's no way out.
You only put up a wall if you're
trying to protect something.
That means we're close.
-  -
--  --
All done pirating for the day?
Not quite.
What are you after this time?
A shipment of men's suits?
Lawn furniture?
No, not today.
Today, we hunt a bigger prize...
your ship.
Masks, suits, fins, tanks at pressure,
regulators, cutting tools, comms.
Now, Cruz, Kudelski, Wallace,
Fiores, you're all going in.
Be damn sure I wish I could join you.
Next time, L.T.
They're lining the pass here to here...
groups of three chained together.
Each mine set appears to be anchored
to the bottom by a single tether.
We figure larger traces
like these here and here
could be contact mines.
Narrower traces could be magnetic.
Normally, I'd have you work in teams,
but we have too many mines to scout.
So you'll be going in solo.
Now, once you get
close enough to a mine,
you'll radio in the intel.
We'll have spec sheets in the CIC
to help you determine how to disarm.
Chandler: All right. Listen up!
I know you're all in a hurry
to get to our people on the
other side of that minefield,
but we got to get ourselves out
of here in one piece first.
So go slow, be smart.
Let's get this done.
Michener: You realize what a
shit storm we're gonna be in
if they don't find their
way out of that minefield?
Barnes is already fishing
for answers about Chandler.
We weren't gonna
broadcast to the country,
and possibly the pirates,
that our Chief of Naval Operations
is playing cowboy on the James.
National Security
issue, plain and simple.
I just heard from Beatty.
The regional leadership committee
- is demanding a meeting.
- Demanding?
Half of them are in town already.
The rest are on their way.
We're gonna have to
level with them about Asia,
bring them into the fold.
I'm afraid Allison's right.
Like it or not, they're our partners,
and they speak for
millions in their territories.
Their support is
crucial, now more than ever.
We've got a banana split here.
Block contact activated.
Block magnetically activated.
Still trying to get a
handle on the third one.
Chandler: Everyone
else seeing the same thing?
Man: Yes, sir.
Wolf, is there any writing on it?
A manufacturers' number?
Anything?
Negative so far.
Look at the tether attachment.
Sometimes the boltheads are stamped.
Nothing.
There's nothing.
Never seen a mine like this before.
I have it at one meter in diameter,
steel casing, painted.
Checking reference based
on physical descriptors.
Stand by.
And what looks like a vent hole
on the center of a
steel box at the bottom.
Vent's screened off.
-
- I can't see in there too well.
There's some kind of
homemade contraption in there.
Anything, Burk?
Nothing yet.
Homemade sounds about right.
Sir, we're drifting.
Suggest we start our starboard
engine and run slow...
two degrees right rudder, one minute
every five to counteract.
Helm, ahead 1/3 for two knots
as necessary to maintain position.
- Muffle starboard and proceed.
- Aye, sir.
All right. Listen up, gentlemen.
Looks like we're gonna
have to start sweeping
with just the information we got.
Stay as clear as you can from
the third mine in each series.
I need you to cut the
chains to the bottom
in a narrow avenue ahead of the ship,
then you are going to gently move
each group out of the way,
one by one.
Are you all ready?
Wolf: Aye, sir.
All right, mine-group
seven, that's you, Kudelski.
- Start now.
- Kudelski, aye.
Commencing cutting 12
lengths beneath the mine.
Captain, we need to belay that order.
There's something about this third mine.
There's some kind of
electrical coiling in it.
Kudelski, stand fast.
Chain's free, Captain.
It's all good. I may need
a hand from another diver
to move these guys.
They're pretty heavy.
Kudelski, did you hear the
captain's order to belay?
It's moving, sir.
- Kudelski.
- Sir.
This mine here. It's
beginning to vibrate.
Kudelski!
- Wolf: Out of the water!
- Back up!
- Out of the water now!
- Back up, now!
Deploy retrieval teams. Everyone
out of the water now!
Wolf: All teams out of the water!
Oh, Jesus, Kudelski's
Captain.
Come.
Bring your doctor.
Rios: High fever.
Jaundice.
She has red flu, but
the blood is not working.
Her pulse is elevated.
She may have the red
flu, but she also has malaria.
That's what's causing all this.
Are you sure?
She has all the symptoms.
I don't need to tell you about
all the mosquitos out there.
What do we need?
No, there's nothing in
here. I need antibiotics.
She's your wife.
God damn sons of bitches!
You find Kudelski?
Nothing to find, sir.
Wolf: Did you see that?
After the explosion?
The mines dropped their anchoring chains.
- All of them?
- That means they're sensing something.
Blast must've triggered them, huh?
Well, we should be able to
push them out the way then, right?
- They're floating free?
- I don't know.
I just know I don't like it.
Neither do I.
Michener: Good to see you, Senator.
Manuel, welcome.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Al, Roberta, Randall, sit down.
Please, sit down.
Thanks for taking the
time, Mr. President.
I know it's not been easy.
Well, I appreciate
you making the trip here.
Obviously, we have a lot to discuss,
so I think we should just jump in.
Danny: Is it possible the explosion
knocked them all free?
If it was powerful enough to do that,
none of us would be standing here.
That coil there.
Maybe it's some kind of sensor.
To make the mines drop their chains?
What would that even accomplish?
Well, look at that
there, behind the coil.
Is that... is that moving?
If it is, it could be a motor.
Is that even possible?
I've seen hundreds of mines.
Never anything like that before.
Chandler: It's an improvised weapon.
Anything's possible.
Sonar, you getting any kind of low hum?
I got something.
Very faint, sir.
I thought it was the echo
off the coral of our gear, but...
TAO, take a listen.
It's barely audible.
Could it be the hum of a motor?
It's getting louder.
Where's it coming from?
It's coming from all around
us, from all directions.
That third mine has its own engine.
The sounds are getting closer.
Mines are coming right at us.
So Nathan James is trapped in
this minefield as we speak!
Michener: That's right.
And when did Chandler leave Hong Kong?
After the kidnapping occurred.
Beatty: At which point
Peng, the president of China,
tried to blow up his plane?
Captain Chandler's
certain that's the case, sir.
And now he's taken the helm
and is personally
leading the rescue mission.
Not quite how you presented it to us.
Well, I'm sure you can understand
I didn't feel comfortable
discussing the details
over our video-conference systems.
Well, I suppose it's a good thing
we showed up here today, then.
Yes, it is, and I
appreciate your support, as always.
Beatty: At the risk of
sounding cold-hearted, I'll be blunt.
These events in Asia are
coming at a bad time.
Our constituents in the territories
are still reeling from the plague
and the chaos that followed.
This situation across the globe,
coupled with tensions over construction...
we're seeing
demonstrations in the streets.
They're not peaceful vigils like
you've got going on here.
We-We've got people on the
brink of... of rioting, Mr. President.
I understand.
So what can I do to help?
Cancel the ration cards.
Restore the land-claim rights.
Open the markets.
Rescind all of my domestic policies.
They're not working and
people aren't happy.
There's not much more they can take...
You think you can waltz in here
and leverage this crisis to muscle me?
Look, when you closed
the banks for a month
and then reopened them with
limited withdrawals,
we supported you even though
our people were up in arms.
When you used the military
to forcibly remove
refugees from their shelters...
Those weren't shelters.
Those were land grabs...
people squatting in homes of
surviving plague victims,
pushing out surviving family members
who had a legitimate right to be there.
- That is an oversimplification, sir.
- Is it?
I'm living in a hotel next door.
I've seen where you
live, Manuel, in that mansion.
It's quite an upgrade from
your previous home.
Tell me, do you even
know who it belongs to?
Beatty: There's no reason
to make this personal, Mr. President.
We're here to help
you as much as ourselves.
You're weak right now.
With what's going on overseas...
people are losing faith.
You can't solve Asia... fine.
Then give the
people something they want.
And if I don't?
I only have so much
control over my region.
Some of our truckers may decide
they no longer want to volunteer
to make those long-haul shipments
all the way to the heartland.
Suddenly, your people don't
have the supplies they need,
then you don't have candles
out there, you've got pitchforks.
Gentlemen, Mrs. Price, I'll remind you
that we were sitting around this
table just five months ago.
We put our hands together and we agreed
that this was the best arrangement
for the country under reconstruction.
The presidency, here, in St. Louis
with the Chief of Staff and my
Secretary of Foreign Affairs
chosen from your regions.
Senator Beatty with the
constitutional authority
to ratify certain new laws,
and I thank you for that...
and an expectation that all of you
would try to maintain
control over your regions
until we sorted out how the
boundaries could be drawn
or whether or not we
needed to elect new governors.
Now, we've got congressional
elections coming up next month,
after which the people, through
the voice of the new Congress,
can decide whether or
not to retain my policies.
Until then, I say this... get
a handle on your people.
If you can't and you really fear rioting,
I will not hesitate to use
the full force of our armed forces
to maintain order in this country.
Now, I have a job to do, and so do you.
As your president, I
advise all of you to get to it.
Thank you for coming and
have a safe trip back.
How's she doing, doc?
Malaria's a funny disease.
It comes in waves.
She's in a lull now.
I don't need to tell
you, we can't lose her.
She's gonna be touch and go for a bit.
And the baby?
If I can't get the fever
spikes under control...
A highly placed source tells me
there is currently broad suspicion
that CNO Tom Chandler
is no longer in China,
but is, in fact, onboard the Nathan James
in pursuit of man called
Takehaya and the hostages.
Whether or not they're making progress,
no one can tell us, except
the man behind that door,
which remains closed.
No questions have been answered today.
Kara: What do you think you're doing?
Turn that off.
Where did you hear that?
So it's true.
Judging by your reaction,
there's no good news.
Get him out of here.
There's no one in there.
They all left for the night.
Who told you about Chandler?
Who do you think?
One of the regional leaders.
Don't you see how
you're being manipulated?
I think it's you and the administration
that are doing the manipulating.
- We could freeze your credentials.
- I thought we still had a free press.
Jacob, this is a sensitive operation.
I am begging you, do
not run that story...
not now.
What do I get?
A sit-down with the president...
- one-on-one.
- Today?
Tomorrow.
Just give us 24 hours.
You got 12.
Sasha: I can't tell how
fast they're moving.
Lucky for us, the motors are very small
and the mines are very large,
and we're 1/4 mile from the closest one.
Well, how soon till the
first one closes in on us?
TAO estimates approximately 44 minutes,
with the next wave
a few minutes later...
if we're still here.
Has anyone talked
about evacuating the ship
while we still have time?
We canvassed the crew.
No one's leaving.
Burk: We already lost one man. I'm
not gonna lose another. What do we do?
Danny: I say we send
the divers out again,
we attach C-4 charges to each
mine, we blow them up one by one.
Cameron: That could
cause a chain reaction
- and blow the whole minefield.
- Burk: You got a better idea?
Put flotation gear on them. Get
them to rise to the surface,
ship takes them out one
by one with the 50-cals.
Not enough time.
TAO... we still have both Nixies?
Yes, sir. Full working order.
How's that gonna help us?
We drag a Nixie behind
us to fool a torpedo.
What's to stop us from
having it trick the mines?
Rig the Nixie tube to
the batteries on the helo,
crank up the sound generator,
and tow it through the
minefield ahead of us.
So the sound it puts out
triggers the sonically
activated mines to blow
and creates a path for the ship.
And we follow the helo's
track as it clears a lane.
How fast can you rig it?
Less than 10, sir. I'm on it.
Sir, I don't think Jesse's helo
can cover enough water in
the time that we have.
You may get a path out, but
by the time it's clear,
the mines on our
flank are gonna take us out.
We can rig the second
Nixie to one of the RHIBs.
You let my team run
interference on the weak side.
You'll be racing over
the mines as the detonate.
We got 100 yards of cable, sir.
We... We put the
Nixie far enough behind us,
it takes the blows.
We keep moving through.
It's the only way.
Get it done.
What is it?
Sir, um...
Driving the RHIB could
be a two-man job,
if it had to be.
Wolf and me... we don't
have wives and kids at home.
Green doesn't need to join.
Understood.
Thank you.
Sir.
Kara, it's May 27th.
I'm recording this message at...
You should know Danny will
be assigned off the ship,
but in case we don't
make it out of here...
please forward the following
message to my children.
Mm.
Ashley, Sam...
I hope to God you never see this.
But if you do...
I wanted you to know...
I wake up every day proud of you.
Please never forget that.
Be brave.
Be kind to each other.
Help each other whenever you can.
And listen to your
grandad once in a while.
He's a pain, but the older I get,
the smarter he seems to be.
I wish I could have been there more.
I hope you know that.
You'll be with Jesse on the helo.
Gator's gonna chart the coordinates,
you and Lieutenant
Green will cover the lookouts.
You're putting me out of harm's way.
We don't come out of this, get
to Okinawa any way you can.
Convince the president
to send our other ships,
find our people.
Bring them back.
Green!
You're lookout on the helo!
- What?
- That's a two-man job!
Lookout, helo, now!
Hundred yards of cable.
Kara: It was leaked.
- And who leaked it?
- He wouldn't tell me.
Michener: It could've
been any one of them.
What does it matter now?
It sounds like you got their backs up
when you threatened martial law.
For all we know, it could be the leaders
stoking the flames with their people.
And even if they are,
we can't risk going toe-to-toe
with them right now.
She's right.
The crisis in Asia trumps
our domestic agenda.
We need to throw them a bone,
make some kind of concession.
Unless the James makes
it out of that minefield.
I'm sorry, Kara.
I know your husband's on that ship,
but we can not count on the
James surviving to bail us out.
Michener: Even if they
do, there's no bailing us out.
The leaders smell blood in the water.
What do you want to give them?
Nothing, except maybe my middle finger.
- Sir...
- Nothing, Alex.
We give them nothing.
CNO on the bridge.
How far to the closest mine?
Let's go.
Cruz:
Commence engine engagement
- procedure.
- Alisha: Aye, sir.
OOD, engage shafts port and starboard.
Engage shafts port and starboard.
Engaging.
We have turns on port shaft.
We have turns on starboard shaft.
Sasha: Releasing the Nixie now.
Chandler: OOD, ahead 2/3 knots.
We do not want to wake up those mines.
We stay a Quiet One.
CCS, CIC, maintain Quiet One.
Helm, no less than 1,000
yards from that helo.
- Give it room to work in front of us.
- Aye, sir.
Gator: Approaching the
first set now, sir.
Port side.
Five degrees starboard!
Come to 0-2-1-2.
The next group is right...
Oh!
There!
That was close.
Two more sets.
Cruz and Wolf, you're up.
Port side.
Steady now.
Got three of them coming
right up, bearing 2-2-5.
Chandler: Nicely done, gentlemen.
How many was that?
I count 12.
Sir, maintaining current speed,
we'll reach the end of the minefield
in less than four minutes.
How we doing, Green?
That's four!
How many left along this line?
I count three remaining.
There! Hold that.
By our count, we've got
three sets left, sir.
Chandler: Copy that.
Alpha team, 2 more sets... 100
yards off our starboard bow.
Bearing 1-6-5.
Got it, sir. On it. Brace, Wolf.
We're turning.
Alpha team, we've got the
same problem midships port side.
Cruz: Heading to your port side.
Permission to increase speed, sir.
No more than 15 knots.
We don't want your engine noise
to set off the whole damn minefield.
Aye aye, Captain.
Hydrophone effects.
I hear hydrophone effects, sir.
Jesus.
Captain, we've got hydrophone effects.
Torpedo incoming. Where?
-
- Son of a bitch.
Where the hell did that come from?
Calculating vector, sir.
All engines ahead flank!
Sonar, radar, find me a contact.
There's a ship out there somewhere.
Wolf, Cruz, be advised torpedo incoming.
Inbound. 7 miles out, doing... 60 knots.
Danny: We have not
swept all the mines, sir!
You are not clear to overtake us!
Sir, no room to evade port or starboard.
Sir, torpedo appears to be a VA-111
big enough to blow the
entire minefield around us.
TAO, what's the bearing on that torpedo?
Bearing 2-4-0 to the
ship... 2-4-5 to you.
You got that?
I got it.
What are they doing?
They're going for the torpedo.
Danny: Holy shit. They're
trying to intercept it.
Can that work?
If they don't intercept far enough out,
the shock waves will
set all the mines off
and kill everyone anyway.
Wolf, let out as much line as you can.
Captain, 15 knots will
not allow us to intercept.
Sir, the Nixie needs to hit that torpedo
beyond the edge of the minefield.
- Gun it, Cruz.
- Cruz: Copy that, sir.
Ah!
Disengage overpower governors.
Jesse, you need to hustle.
Those mines are gonna be exploding
right under our bow if
we get any closer to you.
I go any faster, I'm gonna
pull the Nixie out of the water.
Cruz, 400 yards.
Flare to starboard on my call.
-
- Cruz: Hold on, Wolf!
Hold 2-4-5. Now 2-4-7.
When this thing goes, you do your
damndest to stay in that boat.
Roger that!
When it goes...
dive down, lie flat, hold on.
Fire in 3, 2, 1...
Now!
Shockwave coming!
Brace! Brace! Brace!
TAO.
We're clear, Captain.
Alisha: Wolf, Cruz, come in, over.
Lookouts to the rail.
Prepare to form a search party.
Alisha: Wolf, Cruz, come in, over.
Anything?
You got them?
Burk?
Burk: There's no sign of them, sir.
Just some pieces of the RHIB.
How you doing on fuel, Jesse?
Jesse: Uh, plenty.
Going in for another sweep now.
North-northwest heading
That torpedo came from somewhere.
No contacts on radar or sonar, sir.
These islands here, they
could be taking cover anywhere.
Shh.
We're taking another pass, sir.
Green?
I got nothing, sir.
There! There!
God damn.
Captain, you're never gonna believe this.
- We got them.
-
We got them, sir. We got them.
All right!
- Yes!
- Coming home to Mother.
- Watch yourself.
- Got him.
Sir, we have word from Nathan James.
They made it out of the minefield.
They think they're
closing in on Takehaya.
Well...
we live to fight another day.
Make yourself at home.
You've got a soft spot for him.
Green.
He's my best operator.
I wanted you protected...
if it went to hell.
So you've got a soft spot for me?
That's never been much of a secret.
I've always run
things as a solo operation.
Must be such a burden, having
to make all those decisions...
everyone's lives in your hands.
It's the job.
Well... you do it with grace.
I really did not want to lose you today.
Chandler: I'm gonna get there, Mike.
