Previously on "Vikings..."
We did it, brother.
Rollo: Let's just hope the
Earl sees it that way.
Earl Haraldson: Do you understand
that all this belongs to me?
Rollo: Why did you give
everything away so easily?
Ragnar: Believe me, this is not the end.
Here is a priest of the temple.
His name is Athelstan
. He speaks our language.
I want to sail west again.
Earl Haraldson: On one condition:
A warrior I trust goes with you.
Knut: I will take very close
care of your interests.
Ragnar: I want to leave
as soon as possible.
I'll leave the priest with a key.
You cannot place a slave above me!
I want you to come with me.

Saxon rider: Hi-yah! Hi-yah!
more, give me more
give me more
if I had a heart I could love you
if I had a voice I would sing

I'll see what tomorrow brings
I... I... I...
if I had a voice I would sing

hi-yah! Hi-yah!
How far to Hexham?
It's not far.
Are you sure?
Yes!
Arne:  Ragnar! Rollo!
Let's attack straight away.
No. We attack tomorrow
why wait?
It is a large town.
We have only a few men.
Then surprise is our biggest advantage.
Ragnar: Arne,
what day is it today?
Saturday.
Then we attack tomorrow.
Why?
You will understand tomorrow.
King Aelle: Who were these strangers?
Saxon 2: I cannot say.
Their ship was sighted
sailing up the coast.
It was a ship unlike any other.
They were not Franks, then?
Saxon 2: No. They looked very
different, and used axes.
Most were as tall as giants.
Noble 2: Sire, I fear that these
raiders are the same pagans
who attacked the monastery at Lindisfarne.
It is the letter that
Abbot Alcuin wrote to you
of those terrible events.
King Aelle: "They came to
the church at Lindisfarne",
laid everything waste
with grievous plundering,
trampled the holy place
with polluted steps,
dug up the altars
and seized all the treasure
of the holy church.
They killed some of the brothers,
took some away with them in fetters,
"some they drowned in the sea."
Where do they come from, these pagans?
Some say from the north.
Well, wherever they come from,
they are not welcome in my kingdom.
Floki:
Take care today.
Don't take any foolish risks
and don't get separated from the others.
I was just going to say the
same thing to you, my love.
Enough of that talk.
It's getting light
and we've wasted too much time already.
We must wait a little longer.
Leif: Wait? What for?
Ragnar: Just wait!
Knut: For what?
Ragnar: And listen!
Kauko: I don't hear anything.
Ragnar: Well, what are you waiting for?
Effundetur in remissionem peccatorum.
Priest: Hoc facite in meam commemorationem.
Mysterium fedei.
Brave men: Aggggghhhhhh!
Agh! Ungh!
Shhh!
In the name of God, who are you?
Why have you come here?
This is a place of God.
If you do not resist, we will not hurt you.
Tell that to your people, priest.
Tell them not to be afraid.
God bless.
Priest: Ungh!
Boy: Mom!
Lagertha: Knut! Leave her alone!
Leave her alone!
What do you care for this Saxon, you bitch?
Ungh!
Ragnar:
Where is Knut?
Where is Knut?
I killed him.
You killed him?
Lagertha: He raped a Saxon woman.
Then he tried to rape me.
Did anyone else see it happen?
That's a pity.
And where were you?
Hold!
What is it?
Who is there?!
Saxon prisoner:
Saxon: Archers front!
Shield wall!
Saxon commander:
Saxon soldiers:
Stand!
Ragnar: Open!
Rollo:
Up onto the overturned keel,
clamber, with a heart of steel,
cold is the ocean's spray...
And your death is on its way,
with maidens you have had your way,
viking warriors: Each must die some day!
Ungh!
Agghhhh!
Agghhhh!
Argh!
Lagertha: Ragnar! Ragnar: Close the wall!
Lagertha: Shield wall!
Ungh!
Aghhhhhh!
Wigea: Yah! Yah!
King Aelle: How could this
happen, my lord Wigea?
Wigea: Sire, I have never
in my life seen men fight
as these northmen fight.
Believe me, there's something
devilish in the way they look,
in their lack of fear in the face of death.
King Aelle: My lord, that is
just a counsel of despair.
Are these pagans not men, like we are?
Do they not bleed when they are cut?
Or do they have wings and tongues of fire?
No, sire.
Who are they?
We captured two of them, who
were guarding their boat.
We couldn't understand
anything they said at all,
except one word:
Ragnar.
Ragnar.
Rollo: Death is on its way to take Kauko.
Don't grieve for him. Don't pity him.
Guess where he is now?
The valkyries are taking
him home to Valhalla.
Right at this moment he is...
He is drinking ale with the gods.
Yes,
he is happier than even we are,
with our boat and... these goods.
Erik: Even so, he was my kinsman.
We must avenge his death.
It was done in the name of king Aelle,
and king Aelle must suffer for it.
One day, he will...
If the gods will it.
Look at him,
he's wetting himself.
You kept your word.
You took us to the town,
and I thank you for that.
Drink.
You want to live?
Ungh!
Bjorn: I want to go to Kattegat.
I want to see my father return soon.
He must return soon.
I gave your father my word
that I would look after you both here.
You are not looking after us.
We look after ourselves.
I cannot allow you to go
on your own to Kattegat.
Your father would never
tolerate such a thing.
Bjorn: Then we should go together,
the three of us.
Athelstan: And who will
then look after the farm?
For what we are about to receive,
may the lord make us truly grateful.
Amen.
Gyda: Can I have some ale?
You're too young, Gyda, to drink ale.
I want to make a sacrifice to Thor,
for my father's safe return.
What will you sacrifice?
You!
Athelstan:
Where are you, lord?
Tell me:
Is it your will that I am
here with these heathens?
How does it serve you?
I don't understand.
And for the first time in my life
I am angry with you.
You allow my brothers to
be slaughtered and sold.
Is this really your will?
For the first time...
I feel lonely.
Where are you, lord?
Where are you?
And why don't you answer me?
It's just an owl.
Bjorn.
Bjorn, wake up.
What is it?
We'll go to Kattegat
all of us, tomorrow.
Warrior: Kattegat!
Women and children:
Earl Haraldson: Ragnar Lothbrok, my friend,
how was your voyage?
Successful I hope,
for all our sakes.
Ragnar: The saxons attacked us
when we returned to the boat,
in great force,
But we defeated them!
You are the man that people say you are...
A great adventurer...
And I am happy to salute your achievements
and to share in the profit of your raid.
But I don't see my friend, Knut,
where... where is he?
Knut is dead.
Dead?
Did he die in the battle?
No.
Then how did he die?
I killed him.
You killed him.
For what reason?
Because he tried to rape my wife, Lagertha.
I find it too convenient
that you would make an excuse
to kill my friend
and my agent on your voyage.
What did you think that you would gain
by getting rid of him?
I didn't expect to gain anything.
Earl Haraldson: I don't believe you.
Arrest him!
Ragnar: My lord!
For your wife Siggy
would have you not done the same?
Svein: I would counsel you
all against such actions.
There is no way you could prevail.
Ragnar: Floki.
Svein: Bring him away.
Lagertha: Ragnar! Ragnar!
You summoned me, lord?
Yes, I want to talk to you.
Please, sit. Drink.
It's, um...
It's a delicate matter.
You...
You are the brother of Ragnar Lothbrok,
are you not?
I am.
A spirited man, your brother.
Is he a fair man?
Does he treat you equally
when you sail with him?
Up to a point.
Forgive me, but I think
that he likes to rule you.
And that whatever he says,
in actual fact, he considers himself
to be first among equals.
Am I correct?
I get the impression that he wants to...
To take the credit for everything...
For building the boat, for sailing west.
He wants to be the hero.
Is that what it comes down to?
To him?
Would he have achieved what he has achieved
if it wasn't for you?
What do you say, Rollo?
Of course not.
It would have been impossible.
As long as I am Earl,
Ragnar Lothbrok can give you nothing.
I, on the other hand, can
give you a great deal.
I could, for example,
confiscate the treasure
that you brought back from england...
And offer you a goodly portion of it.
Would you do that, lord?
I might.
Depends.
On what would it depend?
Your ambition.
You want to stand out.
You want to be someone, Rollo.
You want the gods to notice you, yes?
They would have noticed me already.
Earl Haraldson: Oh no, my friend.
And do you know why?
Because you still walk in the
shadow of Ragnar Lothbrok.
Don't you think it's time
you stepped out from it
and let the gods see you
for who you really are?
Oh! I want you to say hello to somebody.
This is my daughter, Thyri.
She is soon to get married
and I must think very carefully
about her future husband.
He must be a man of ambition and prospect,
as you can understand.
I used to have two boys
but they were killed.
So the man that I choose
to be my son-in-law
will hold a high and special place,
as if he were my own son.
Thyri, say hello to Rollo.
Hello.
Hello.
Siggy: Don't forget about me, my love.
Earl Haraldson: Oh, yes.
And this is Siggy, my wife.
This is Rollo.
He is the brother of Ragnar Lothbrok.
Hello, Rollo.
I have heard a lot about you.
They say that you are a great warrior.
Svein: Bring in the prisoner.
Woman: That murderer!
Bjorn: Look at him!
He's in chains.
It's all right, boy.
We are all aware of the sacred
nature of our duty here.
You stand before us accused
of the willful murder
of Knut, my brother.
Knut, as some of you may know,
was the bastard son of my father.
But I loved him...
Like a brother.
I asked Knut to...
To go with Ragnar Lothbrok to england,
where they raided a town and
brought back many spoils.
And while they were raiding this town,
Ragnar Lothbrok took it upon himself
to cold-bloodedly kill my brother.
It's easy to imagine
why a man like this would do such a thing.
This is an ambitious man.
He doesn't care to share his spoils,
and he resents the fact
that he owes me loyalty and obedience,
as his chieftain.
This is a man who does not
believe in our traditions.
This is a man who does
not believe in our laws.
Crowd:
Svein: Silence! Silence!
Earl Haraldson: What do you have to say,
when you stand before us,
and know that you must tell the truth?
It is that true that I killed Knut,
sadly, your brother.
But I killed him
when I found him trying to rape my wife.
I ask all of you freemen,
what would have you done
if you were in my place?
Would have you just stood back,
encouraged the culprit?
I don't think you would.
And even if I had of known at the time
he was your brother,
I would have carried out the same sentence.
Svein: Do you seriously ask
us to believe your story?
I can confirm the story.
You are the wife of Ragnar Lothbrok?
I am, lord.
How extraordinary that
you happened to be there
at the same time.
Your husband is lying
and you are so under his thumb
that he has persuaded you to lie for him.
May Thor strike you dead!
Earl Haraldson: What did you say?
My husband did not kill Knut Tjodolf.
Svein: Then who did?
Lagertha: I did! I killed him.
I stabbed him in the heart
when he tried his best to rape me.
Svein: A murder is committed
and the only witnesses are
a husband and his wife.
Unfortunately, we can't tell
who committed the crime
because they both claim credit for it.
You didn't kill my brother.
Look at you, how could you?
He killed my brother.
Ragnar Lothbrok killed my brother.
We have proof.
We have a witness to the killing.
Svein: You say you are a witness
to the death of Knut Tjodolf?
Yes.
Svein: You'll swear this
upon your arm ring?
Yes, I was there.
I saw everything.
Earl Haraldson: So, who killed my brother?
Ragnar Lothbrok killed him.
In cold blood?
No, lord. For a good reason.
What Ragnar Lothbrok has sworn is true.
Your half-brother was caught
raping a Saxon woman.
Then he attempted to rape
Ragnar's lawful wife,
Lagertha, the shield-maiden.
So unfortunately...
You cannot punish him.
Now who has the key?
Woman: Come, Bjorn. Man:
Like father like son.
It seems I owe you an eternal debt.
I know.
And I look forward to collecting it.
Leif: Let's drink a toast to Ragnar!
To his future and his freedom!
No, no, no, no.
To friends and freedom!
All: To friends and freedom!
Arne:  Not that
he'll ever be free of us!
Ragnar: Will you drink with me?
Of course.
Thank you for taking care of my children.
You're a good Christian.
I wanted to say thank you.
You did a fine good thing, Rollo.
I hope the gods were watching.
I didn't do it for him.
I did it for you, shield-maiden.
I don't want to believe that.
Floki: Ragnar!
Did you see Haraldson's face
when he had to acquit you
and then give you half his hoard?
He looked like this!
Ungh!
Man: Ragnar Lothbrok?
I am unarmed.
Get the children.
Lagertha: Hurry!
Man: Aaggghhhh!
Ellisef:
Leif: Father.
Ragnar: Ungh!
Ungh!
Ungh!
Seer: Stones and bones.
Stones and bones.
Earl Haraldson: What do you read?
Seer: Wait. Not so impatient, lord.
Earl Haraldson: Tell me.
Seer: Ask me a question
are the signs... threatening?
Seer: Yes.
There is a quarrel.
There will be violence...
Bones and skulls broken. I see that.
Athelstan: What is Ragnar doing
sitting on the hillside?
Seer: He searches for your death;
consults the gods to
whom he claims kinship.
Who could believe such a thing?
Does he desire to be Earl?
If he kills you, will it not be so?
Do the gods speak?
Seer: Do they ever stop?
Gods have always been favorable to me.
They allowed yours sons to die...
Earl Haraldson: Do the gods really exist?
I know what he's doing.
He's preparing himself.
