Target acquired.
Roger that. Target confirmed.
Fire at wiII.
Make your target, corporaI.
You got a time probIem,
gentIemen.
Lock your TRS
and get this over with.
TRS verifying target.
Just eyebaII the fucker
and puII the trigger.
I heard that, Beckett.
We got incoming bogeys.
Range, 650 yards.
We have
a 5-miIe-an-hour wind,
midrange,
coming from your Lima.
Attempting to confirm target.
Sir, Evers's puIse,
respiration and GSR
are maxing out.
What about Beckett?
No, steady as a rock.
It's Iike he's taking a nap.
You're running out
of time, gentIemen.
Take the shot, Evers.
I couId hit a hostage,
Master Gunny--
Take the fucking shot.
Stand down.
Stand down, gentIemen.
You okay, Master Gunny?
Perfect.
Abso-fucking-IuteIy perfect.
Target status..
target destroyed.
He made that damn shot.
I can't beIieve it.
He made that goddamn shot!
Game over.
Your position was about
to be compromised.
Your directive was to abort
that mission.
We're Marine Scout
Snipers, Captain.
We don't abort missions
unIess we stop breathing.
You weren't supposed
to make that shot.
No one's supposed to.
WeII, I compIeted
my mission.
Back in my days--
Fuck your days!
That was the Iuckiest
fuckin' shot
in the history of
Iucky fuckin' shots!
Sorry I broke
your toy, Captain.
But if a sniper had
to depend on that,
he'd end up dead.
It's not a video game
out there.
It's aII about one shot
and one kiII.
You're a risk,
you know that?
You're a goddamn IiabiIity
that I, for one,
am not going to risk...
Getting bored, are we?
I'm not cutting into your
precious drinking time, am I?
Begging
the Captain's pardon, sir,
but yes, sir, I am.
And yes, sir, you are, sir.
I don't Iike you,
Master Gunnery Sergeant.
And I don't care
about that fucking deaI
you made with the Corps!
You faiI that
medicaI next week,
I'II bury your ass
back in the reaI worId.
And that's a promise.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
I got him. Get your sniper.
CongratuIations, NeiI.
Hey, buddy.
%%
CongratuIations.
Hey, nice going,
NeiI, buddy. Good job.
Mom, mom, it's time.
No, he said he'd be here.
It's okay.
I taIked to him
yesterday--
Come on, NeiI, the TV peopIe
want a shot of us
cutting the cake.
We can't wait any Ionger.
Okay.
Sorry, mom.
This Iooks more
Iike a campaign
photo opportunity
than a wedding.
We've decided to forgo
the speeches today
because of
an unavoidabIe absence.
If that's Beckett
you're taIking about,
he probabIy got Iost
on the way to the bar.
WeII, he's right.
No way I couId do this
without a coupIe of taII ones.
Sydney.
You knew I'd make it.
Do me the honors?
Okay.
ActuaIIy,
these kind of affairs
scare the heII out of me.
NeiI.
Many years ago, your oId man
made me promise
him something.
That, were he not abIe
to attend your wedding day,
I wouId read
this Ietter to you.
''If that grunt Beckett
is reading this,
''then I didn't make it.
''I'm hoping
this part of the Ietter
''is being read
at your wedding.
''I just wanted
to Iet you know
that I Iove you,
''and that I wish
you and your bride
nothing but happiness.
''Love her
and cherish her aIways.
''And may you both Iive
as Iong as you want,
and never want as
Iong as you Iive.''
NeiI,
I've been hoIding onto this
for a Iong time.
Now I think it's yours.
CongratuIations.
Thanks, Tom.
JoceIyn and NeiI Finnegan.
%%
Every time I Iook at NeiI,
I see the man
PauI never got to be.
WeII, I'm sure his father
wouId be very proud of him.
Mmm-hmm.
You know, this is a circus.
She's got her eyes
set on the White House,
and won't stop
tiII she gets him there.
He's the son of a war hero,
graduates first in
his cIass at AnnapoIis,
Harvard SchooI of Government.
Mmm-hmm.
CIimbing his way up
the poIiticaI Iadder
with honest Iiving
and hard work.
HeII, he's got my vote.
Mine, too.
Your hand's shaking.
When did that start?
Ah, it's a few months ago.
It's nothing.
Might be, might not.
You shouId stop by the office
and Iet me Iook at it, hmm?
Tom, come on.
Okay.
We're Marine Scout Snipers.
The onIy time we
abort a mission
is when
we stop breathing, sir.
It's a very big mistake.
Besides the obvious,
his conduct record
since returning from Europe
has been questionabIe.
Psychs are a bit disturbing.
And he's just
oId.
He's the same age I am.
We may get one shot
and one shot onIy.
I want Beckett taking it.
You suffered nerve damage
when you Iost the finger.
The condition's been steadiIy
deteriorating ever since.
The digitorum tendon,
when functioning normaIIy,
fIexes and extends the finger.
But here on the damaged hand,
you couId have
an invoIuntary refIex
at any time.
And it's more IikeIy to occur
in a high-stress situation.
What I see here, Thomas,
aIso Iooks Iike
the earIy stages of paIsy.
You can't be
a Marine forever, you know.
Yeah, I know.
I was just hoping
to make it to 65.
You know, you shouId think
about getting on
with your Iife.
And do what?
WeII, you shouId
meet someone speciaI,
you know, settIe down.
Oh.
Yeah.
Why didn't you?
WeII, I did.
But I guess, uh, the few years
I had with PauI were enough.
And besides,
you never asked me.
Hey.
Mmm-hmm.
We had some good times,
the 3 of us.
Down at Camp Lejeune,
remember?
Yeah.
Ah, Syd--
Don't.
He didn't come back.
A Iot of young men
didn't come back.
Why don't you get out
of that horribIe moteI
and come and stay with me?
Oh.
WeII.
TeII you the truth,
I've been Iiving out of
a sea bag aII my Iife.
I've onIy got
a few more weeks
of the training sessions,
then the Corps wiII
just ship me out to some other
duty station somewhere.
Then you shouId
caII me sometime
and ask me to dinner,
I haven't
had a date in 30 years.
Syd, I'd reaIIy appreciate it
if you didn't teII
anyone about this.
Okay.
Thanks.
See you.
Jarheads.
KiII him! KiII him!
KiII him!
Madness.
Madness.
Beckett, Iet's go, Iet's go!
Let's get out of here!
Let's go, Iet's go!
Goddamn,
they're getting cIose!
Love it!
Just cover my ass, Beckett.
Shit!
Finnegan! Finnegan!
Lay him down.
Lay him down.
You'II be okay, Tommy.
You're going to be okay.
WeIcome to the tunneIs,
Tommy.
Can't see a goddamn thing.
You'II get used to it.
It's where
the reaI shit happens, man.
Here, take this.
What is it?
Good Iuck. Took it off a gook
a coupIe of days ago.
NVA motherfuckers!
You didn't answer,
Master Guns.
Your door was unIocked.
If I wanted
cIowns to wake me up,
I wouId've joined the circus.
With aII due respect,
Master Guns,
you shouId've
been a comedian.
What the heII do you want?
We have orders to take you in
to go see the brass,
Master Gunnery Sergeant.
Yeah, weII, I don't want
to see the brass.
Let's get him in the shower.
Sir, you couId
have your pick
of a dozen of
the Corps' best snipers.
CorporaI Evers
is a particuIarIy good shot.
I'm not interested in him.
I'm interested
in Thomas Beckett.
This is NSA Deputy
Director WiIIiam Avery.
We know each other, Captain.
We served together.
A Iifetime ago, sir.
Best goddamn sniper
I had the priviIege
of working with.
WeII, thank you, sir.
What can I do for you?
Tom, I want you
on a pIane tomorrow.
To where, sir?
Vietnam.
Captain.
I want you to take out
a target there.
A mountain
warIord from Phum Bat.
He and his rogue army
are running opium,
stoIen goods, weapons,
aImost anything
they can get their hands on.
Sounds Iike a pain in the ass
for the Vietnamese, sir.
Why are we getting invoIved?
He's graduated
to bigger and better things.
We have inteIIigence
that Ieads us to beIieve
he's been taIking business
with the Jamaah IsIamiyah.
Oh, what kind of business?
Terrorism.
He's ventured
into the big Ieagues.
WeII,
with aII due respect, sir,
there's not very much here.
Do we even know
what he Iooks Iike?
Captain Laraby,
wouId you mind excusing us?
Of course not, sir.
Addis.
Finnegan.
Thanks, Tom.
His body was shipped home.
What was Ieft of the body.
A body.
It's a Iong story, Tom.
Let me try to
expIain some of it.
During the Iast days
before the faII of Saigon,
PauI Finnegan was recruited.
Recruited by who?
The CIA.
His first op was to
heIp the Khmer Rouge
run heroin out
of the highIands.
His cut financed
the covert operations.
As the years passed,
our interests changed.
Finnegan was
offered a new op,
but the jungIe
had changed him.
That patriotic
fervor had changed
into something eIse,
something
that makes him dangerous.
He's a threat.
To you, me, his famiIy,
and his country.
WeIcome to the tunneIs,
Tommy.
What the heII's
he doing here?
Is there any other
way to handIe this?
A deaI or an arrangement?
There's no other way.
We've Iearned
the Ho Chi Minh PoIice
have set up
a sting to capture him.
That cannot happen.
If he is identified,
you can imagine
the probIems
that we might face.
The expIanations.
Not to mention
the effect on his famiIy,
his son...
You're asking me to kiII
the man who saved my Iife.
I know how incredibIy bizarre
this must seem to you, Tom,
but beIieve me,
this is not the man
that you once knew.
Over the years, he has become
a coId-bIooded kiIIer.
And I'm ashamed to say,
we bear some responsibiIity
for that
and, uh, an obIigation
to rectify the mistake.
As a sniper,
you have the option
to refuse the mission.
But I need an answer, Tom.
By 0800.
I'II understand
if you can't do this.
I'II find somebody eIse.
No.
I'II do it. AIone.
I want no observer with me.
I don't want
anybody eIse's hand in it.
How can you be so
sure he'II do it
when the time comes?
One way
or another,
he wiII get
the job done.
It's aII he's got Ieft.
His Iife isn't
worth a damn
unIess he's risking it,
or taking someone eIse's.
First time in Ho Chi Minh?
Last time I was here,
it was caIIed Saigon.
Uh, Beckett, Thomas.
WeIcome to Ho Chi Minh,
Mr. Beckett.
First time in Vietnam?
No.
Do you want
anything, sir?
If you know what
I mean, you know?
Yeah, I know what you mean,
and thanks but no thanks.
Sure? Because Ky Mam
can get you anything.
Anything that you want.
Any good massage?
Uh, happy ending.
Thank you, sir.
Your bag has arrived, sir.
You must have the wrong room.
I aIready have my bags.
Not this one,
Master Gunnery
Sergeant Thomas Beckett.
My name is Quan. Detective,
Ho Chi Minh City PoIice.
AIso your operations contact.
Like I give a shit
about some badge.
What's
the operation code name?
Cobra.
Come on in.
Interesting choice of shirt.
You Iook Iike
a Canadian tourist.
You'II find
what you need here.
They say you can make
miIIion-to-one shot.
You are the go-to guy.
Yes?
They say a Iot of things.
You rest after your trip,
then we have some dinner.
We taIk.
I show you the spot.
Be ready at 1 1 :30.
This bring back memories,
Mr. Beckett?
They toId me
a IittIe about you.
You were here
for the worst of it.
None of it was good.
You must have
been very young.
Okay.
Who eIse knows
I'm here besides you?
If you're taIking about
the Ho Chi Minh PoIice,
no one.
If they knew,
I'd be a dead man.
AII right,
then how do we work this?
How do I find my target?
I arrested his biggest deaIer
in Ho Chi Minh City,
and convinced him to, uh,
how do you say,
to finger the Cobra for us.
Why do you caII him that?
They treat him Iike
he's a king. King Cobra.
They're just kids, reaIIy.
Some bareIy in their teens.
You cut off the head,
the snake wiII die,
beIieve me.
The deaIer toId us
about a meeting
between Cobra
and a new cIient.
We wiII be there
to arrest him.
You take him out
before that happens.
Here in Saigon?
Saigon?
OId habits die hard, huh?
At one of the estabIishments
the cobra owns. CIub Cong.
Check this out.
This is very new.
I'm going to make
the deaIer put it
on the Cobra.
It'II send a signaI
to your TRS computer.
That way it'II be
easy to find him
in the crowd.
By the way,
how are your weapons?
The AW Magnum's just fine.
Where did you get that?
Fucking Japanese.
Pretty cooI, huh?
How cIose do I
get to my target?
Outside, inside.
Come on, eat up.
I think it's best I show you.
How Iong have you
been a poIiceman?
When did the NSA
recruit you?
CoupIe of years ago.
You see how it is?
No better than before.
Things need to change.
Maybe you guys don't
fuck up Iike Iast time.
Was your oId man in the war?
Yes.
NVA?
My father
was an American GI,
Nobody here knows this.
He die here?
Went home to his reaI famiIy
somewhere in Ohio.
There. You see that roof?
That's CIub Cong.
Your target wiII be there
tonight around 10:00.
He usuaIIy sits at
a tabIe on the upper deck.
WiII it be crowded?
It usuaIIy is.
What about the street?
He's got to come and go.
The entrance is
on the other side.
There's no sniper angIe.
After you take the shot,
you abandon your weapon here,
and buy a ticket
on Tan Son train.
It'II take you
to the airport.
What about the cIeanup?
A new identification
has been arranged.
The body wiII not be cIaimed.
PoIice wiII be
satisfied the Cobra is dead
and no one wiII know
who he reaIIy was.
Mr. Beckett.
I wiII not see
you after this.
That's my ceII phone number.
CaII onIy if
you need something
or if something is wrong.
And remember,
one shot is
probabIy aII you get.
One shot is aII I need.
Everything is in pIace.
The op is on-Iine.
Everything is in pIace.
The op is on-Iine.
How's Beckett doing?
Our contact says he's fine.
No hesitations?
Doesn't seem so.
Target?
On the move as we speak.
His buyer has arrived.
So far, so good.
If everything goes weII,
it'II be over in
Iess than 10 hours.
From your Iips
to God's ear.
'Cause if it doesn't,
we're aII in deep shit.
HeIIo.
It's me.
Thomas?
Yeah.
It's 4..00 in the morning.
Is something wrong?
Oh, Sydney,
I'm--I'm sorry, I...
You sound so distant.
Where are you?
Oh...
About 30 years away.
Thomas?
I'm sorry, Syd.
I'm--I'm sorry for waking you.
I...
Are you okay?
I'm okay. I just...
I've been thinking about
how you and NeiI are...
You're
the cIosest thing
I've ever had to a famiIy.
And I--I know
sometimes I...
Sometimes I forget
how much that's meant to me.
And I just wanted to
make sure you knew.
We know, Thomas.
We know.
Are you sure you're okay?
Yeah. I'm okay.
Look, I gotta go.
Um,
I'II teII you what.
I'II--I'II, uh,
I'II give you
a caII in a few days,
you know, after I get back.
You promise?
I promise. Yeah.
You know I Iove you.
I Iove you.
Me, too.

What the fuck
are you Iookin' at?
You're asking me to kiII
the man who saved my Iife.
What the heII's
he doing here?
A Iot of young men
didn't come back.
Goddamn piece of shit.
Do it.
Shit.
Now!
Forgive me.
Damn.
Got you, fucker.
You're not that good
a fucking shot,
but you might get Iucky.
What the heII happened?
What the heII happened?
Beckett
missed the target.
But he took out
our goddamn backup?
We're fucked,
truIy fucked.
Where is he now?
The Vietnamese poIice
have him.
It shouId be easy for our men
to get to him, right?
Our contact is
not trained for that.
Then get someone who is.
TaIk to me.
I toId you,
my name is Beckett.
Thomas J. Beckett.
And what are you doing here,
Thomas J. Beckett?
Soakin' up Asian cuIture.
The man you kiIIed
on the roof,
he was Cambodian nationaI.
Maybe you two
got something to do
with what happened
at CIub Cong tonight.
CIub Cong?
Look, I want to speak
to the American ConsuI.
Sure. You bet.
The NationaI PoIice
have taken over the case.
You shouId have
thought of that
when you changed
the pIan and forgot
to teII me about
the secondary hit.
I'II see what I can do.
Weird fucking worId,
ain't it, Tommy?
Finnegan?
Fucking weird.
After aII these years,
they send my oId hump buddy
Beckett to do the job.
That was Avery's idea,
wasn't it?
What happened?
You couId aIways make
the miIIion-to-one shot.
Losing your touch,
or change of heart?
Fucking Avery
Iied to you, Tommy.
That's something
the two of us have in common.
Which Iie?
The one about
you deaIing drugs?
Or running weapons?
Or the Jamaah IsIamiyah?
They know about that, huh?
Why, Finn?
What other choice
does a dead man have?
I gave my Iife
to serve God and country.
You're a deaIer in death.
Whose God and country
do you serve?
The Iast thing I need
is a sermon about death
from an assassin.
I did the job they asked
and they soId me out.
Then why didn't you come home
when it ended?
This is my home.
It was aIways my home.
I knew it the second
we hit that LZ in Tay Ninh.
After that first night,
I knew
I wasn't going back, Tommy.
I was aIive here!
Even in aII the death,
I was aIive!
Nothing ever made me
feeI Iike that back there.
Nothing and no one.
Some peopIe are born for war.
This isn't war, Finn.
This is madness.
What about Syd and NeiI?
You know,
your son just got married.
I deIivered your note
as promised.
They don't exist.
They haven't existed
for over 30 years.
It was better that way.
For everyone.
Someone tried to kiII me
after I took the shot.
You're in it now.
You shouId have quit
when you were ahead.
In what?
I can bury them, Tommy,
that's what
they're afraid of.
You're not the first one
to come gunning.
They've been trying for years.
That's why I
stay in the ditch.
Sorry you got
yourseIf into this.
But then,
you aIways were an ideaIist.
That's what
they counted on, Tommy.
NeiI's the one
I feeI sorry for.
He thinks he's
the son of a war hero.
Every day, I watch this worId
descend into heII.
I'm just trying
to find myseIf
a nice comfortabIe
seat with a good view.
Somebody bIew up
the goddamn poIice station
at Ho Chi Minh.
What?
HeIIo.
Now, Iisten to me,
you IittIe fuck,
and don't you say a word.
Meet me at the peopIe's
unification buiIding
in 2 hours.
You come aIone
or I'II teII
the Ho Chi Minh poIice
who you reaIIy work for.
I didn't know what
they were gonna do.
They never--
HeIIo?
It was a game
both sides pIayed.
Look, I didn't know.
They never toId me
the hit on you
was part of the operation.
I swear.
What happened to Finnegan?
They don't know yet.
They're stiII
identifying bodies.
I've spent years
trying to forget this shit.
You reaIIy think
it was going to be that easy?
You're going to
get me out of here.
And go where?
You're gonna get me
another rifIe and a sidearm.
And go where?
If he's aIive,
he's in the ditch.
Hang on a sec, Senator.
We had some peopIe
in Phnom Penh.
They shouId be in Ho Chi Minh
in Iess than an hour.
The bad news is that
our boy's gone AWOL.
What do you mean, AWOL?
He hasn't checked in.
What about
Finnegan and Beckett?
They're stiII ID-ing bodies,
but neither of them
are on the Iist so far.
I don't fucking beIieve this.
I'm going to have
to caII you back.
No, it's under controI.
If Beckett is stiII aIive,
and he's gotten to our boy...
I know.
You and Finnegan
were friends?
I mean,
reaI good friends?
Yeah. He saved my ass once.
This must be hard then.
Yeah.
He's a bad guy.
I know.
How do you know
he's up in Tay Ninh?
Not in. Under.
When I knew Finnegan,
he was a tunneI rat.
Everybody knows about them,
and what they did.
Yeah, weII,
they did what they had to do.
Some say they Iike it.
You're not
supposed to Iike it.
What the fuck
do you know about war?
How can you
be sure he's there?
Because when
I was in the jaiI,
he sIipped.
He mentioned something about
''being in the ditch.''
And that's what
the rats caIIed the tunneIs.
ShouId we contact someone?
Someone you can trust?
Right now,
I don't trust anybody.
What the heII is that?
PoIice or NSA?
NSA.
They're in pursuit
of the signaI.
Our boy's headed
towards Tay Ninh.
Beckett's with him.
He's goin' after Finnegan.
What the heII's
he doing here?
Say heIIo to Stevie York.
We're the 6:00 news, Tommy.
Some men came
through here midday.
They headed into the jungIe.
One was white.
He's headed home.
You reaIIy expect
to go in there
by yourseIf
and come out aIive?
No.
You're goin' with me.
Why wouId I want to do that?
WeII, you wanted to know
why they tried to kiII me.
The answer's in there
with Finnegan.
You see, there's something
he didn't teII me.
The reaI reason
they sent me.
And it was supposed
to end with him
and me.
Where the heII
did you dig this up?
It's my father's.
It's aII he Ieft behind.
I Iearned to shoot with it.
Is it okay?
Best damn sniper
rifIe ever made,
if you ask me.
You didn't teII me
your oId man was a sniper.
You didn't ask.
Our Cambodian units
found the ceII phone
on the side of
the road to Tay Ninh.
They must have figured
out it was traceabIe.
Not they. Beckett.
What do we do now?
TeII them to keep Iooking.
And pray to God
that they find Beckett
before he finds Finnegan.
It's getting--
HoId it down.
We're never going
to find this pIace.
Beckett.
You okay?
There's more of them.
He's dry. Get him! Get him!
He's the Iast one.
He'II probabIy be
heading for the tunneIs.
There.
Ah, he's just a kid.
He was going to warn them.
Right. I know.
Finnegan knows
we're here aIready.
It's just a game to him.
We won the first round.
Pass go, coIIect $200.
Now it's our chance
to spend it.
What?
It's a game.
You know, Iike mahjong?
Stay cIose to me
and do as I say.
How do you know
which way to go?
I don't.
Great.
Why not just yeII out
and teII them we're here?
How're we going to see?
No Iights.
Which way?
What?
I hear it.
Sounds Iike music.
Sounds Iike NWA.
What?
NWA.
Niggas with attitude.
You know, Ice Cube,
Dr. Dre? The Rappers.
Sounds Iike Fuck Tha PoIice.
What kind of idiots
wouId write a song Iike that?
You ought to try Iistenin'
to a IittIe Bob Seger.
What?
CouIdn't Ieave it aIone,
huh, Tommy?
Let him go.
He's not part of this.
He is now.
You brought him
aIong for a reason.
I'm thinking agency.
And maybe NSA.
I'm not gonna waste
your time trying to
justify myseIf, Tommy.
We're both kiIIers.
Different kinds.
When I kiII a man,
it's because he
needs kiIIin'.
I Iook at his Iife
and if it adds up to nothin',
I take him out.
But you, Finn,
you got to Iikin' it.
I never did.
So what's this
aII about, Finn?
How does it aII end here?
It's about Stevie York.
You remember Stevie,
don't you?
Say heIIo to Stevie York.
What the heII's
he doin' here?
The AP Photographer?
It's about Stevie
and me and Avery.
And GayIor.
John GayIor, the senator?
Soon to be president,
some say.
What about Stevie York?
He fiImed it aII.
We were higher than kites.
Smokin' and huntin'
for 3 days without sIeep.
There was 9 of them.
When it was done,
we started getting paranoid.
We'd make York
destroy the fiIm.
But as the days passed,
GayIor and Avery kept getting
more and more psycho on me.
So we made a pact,
the 3 of us.
And then we kiIIed Stevie
and made it Iook
Iike the NVA did it.
So what now, Tommy?
What's our next move?
TeII you what.
You couId just waIk
out of here and go home.
If I Ieave,
the cop goes with me.
Go, get out, Beckett!
You know I can't
Iet that happen, Tommy.
You're going to
have to kiII me.
The onIy way I see it
from here is to kiII him.
What's your oId sayin'?
''One shot, one kiII.''
How about, one shot, 2 kiIIs?
A miIIion-to-one.
Isn't that what
they used to say?
Do it. They're gonna
kiII me one way or another.
He's right, Tommy.
Take your best shot.
The digitorum tendon fIexes
and extends the finger.
Time's running out
for one of us.
Come on, Tommy,
make your move!
Quan,
what's happening here?
They say you're the Mongoose.
Come again?
The Mongoose.
It's a-- It's an oId
Vietnamese foIk taIe.
When God created the Cobra,
he made him king.
As time passed, the Cobra
became so powerfuI
he thought he was God.
So God created the Mongoose
to take his power away.
Mmm-hmm.
What do they want?
Whatever you want.
You have the power now.
You're kiddin' me.
It's true, I toId you.
They're just kids.
Kids do anything.
Listen to me.
There's a CoIoneI McKenna.
CoIoneI Dan McKenna.
MiIitary InteIIigence.
He's stationed
at the Pentagon
in Washington DC.
I want you to
contact him and onIy him.
TeII him what happened here.
And teII him I'II need
a dust-off in 2 days
where the Kampong
and Mebon rivers
meet in Cambodia.
Why not come back with me?
They'II be Iooking
for me in the Nam.
I think it's safer
if I DD across the border
into Cambodia.
Can you ask them that?
You trust me to do this?
If in 2 days I get there,
and there's not
a chopper to evac me out,
then I'II guess
I was wrong about you.
Quan.
You, too.
Hey, Beckett.
You're one heII of a shot.
Was.
Was.
In breaking news today,
it was Iearned
that Senator John GayIor
from Texas
has resigned his seat
in the Senate.
In his statement
read by a spokesman,
the Senator
said he has decided
to end his
poIiticaI aspirations
and enter the private sector.
His resignation
came as a compIete surprise
to the White House.
Senator GayIor
was thought to be
his party's Ieading candidate
for the upcoming
presidentiaI race.
The news of
the Senator's departure
must be very
troubIing for the President,
considering it
was just 2 days ago
that one of his
most trusted advisors,
WiIIiam Avery,
Deputy Director of the NSA,
was found dead,
an apparent suicide.
