THE OLD GUN
There.
Marcel the dog is waiting
for his master, huh?
He is happy, Marcel the dog!
The most beautiful dog in the whole world!
Yes, yes...
- Are you afraid?
- Yes.
Just like you, darling.
Come in.
Doctor, the blinded patient
is still screaming.
I'm on my way.
And no morphine left,
of course!
Give him a sedative:
he must sleep.
Ah, gently.
Don't move.
It's pointless.
It seems you don't like my visits.
- There are only sick people here.
- I know.
But sick communists.
Sick saboteurs even!
They change bed every day, right?
Chief, we found him!
- He has killed 2 of my men.
- I am not a politician!
That's what cowards say!
In harsh times.
I am not a politician.
I treat the wounded.
Either you leave him here
or I go tell Major-Doctor Muller!
Mister Dandieu,
the war is not over yet.
Do you know what would happen
if you were not a surgeon?
I'd take you to the German Gestapo
to have you shot!
Oh yes...
I've had my eye on you
for quite a while...
You have a family...
A wife...
A daughter...
In their own interest,
...behave.
No! No!
No!
Them, again!.
Don't let his happen, Muller.
Mister Dandieu, I still have
I don't know where or how.
Anyway, it is a problem between French.
Is there any sulfamide left?
- No. Nothing left.
In a month or two
you'll be free.
Maybe you'll have penicilline,
while me...
They'll probably come back.
- No doubt.
What about the lung patient?
Which one?
The one who blew up the Paris train.
Ah, yes. Another hero.
A pain in the ass, all these heroes.
Bring him to the cellar
near the boiler room.
He cannot be transported.
- He can be transported,
or else you don't know
what you want...
If they come back, they take him
and they kill him.
And they arrest us.
Make it happen, for God's sake.
What is it?
- Dandieu.
Here is the sulfamide,
and 18 ampoules of morfine.
- That's all I could get.
- Better than nothing, thanks.
Halt!
Papers!
It is forbidden to go out
during the curfew.
Do you have a safe-conduct?
Please excuse us, Doctor.
- I was worried, mister Julien.
- Everything's fine, Jeanne.
- I hope they didn't wait for me?
- No, but I kept a dish for you.
Thanks! But I'm not hungry.
Go to bed, Jeanne. Thank you.
How did it go at the hospital?
Oh, Marcel the dog!
What a beautiful dog!
The radio announces
that in Normandie
the Americans cast off
the Germans to the sea.
And some people say that
the Das Reich division
is going from Montauban
to the Normandie front.
Listen, I'm tired, mum.
Do you want a drink?
- Yes, please.
- I only have white wine left.
- It'll do fine.
Are you mad?
- I didn't want to put that one.
- Which one did you want to put?
This one, the double six.
- She was right.
- Of course, you have all the sixes.
You would have won the game.
Check, I'm sure of it.
- Ah! Damn, it is the second time!
- I can't see a thing. And I bring the wine.
Wait, madame Dandieu.
Come on, Marcel, not now.
Shut up.
What's that?
Florence?
Yes, she is the laundry room,
washing herself.
- Washing herself? At this time?
- Yes.
- What an idea...
My towel fell in the water!
- I'm coming, dear!
Thank you, mum.
I'm coming!
- Wait for me, Clara.
- I'm going...
No, stay here,
I have something to tell you.
Clara!
- Yes?
I love you.
- So what? Are you coming?
- Yes.
Yes, we're coming!
It stings, I have soap in my eyes.
- Wait...
Come closer.
There...
Eh! No!
Ah, I can't see either now!
- It's all over my glasses.
- Didn't mean to...
- Where are your clothes?
- In my bedroom.
You came own here naked?
- Well yes.
She is mad.
My daughter is mad.
- My glasses?
- Wait. Get dry.
- Nobody cares about my glasses!
- I'll take care of it! There you are, sir!
I go back to François. You go
straight to bed. Good night.
- Do you hear them?
- Yes, glad the women are here, mum!
It's getting late, I have to go.
- Who's on call? - Berson and Thibodée.
They're overloaded. They're expecting you.
I had the saboteur hidden
in the boiler room.
- Why?
- The militia has come again.
They found the young Drobée.
They took him away.
I couldn't do anything.
I'm a little scared, François.
They're dangerous, you know.
They realise that they're down for.
So...
They're getting mad.
- Have they threatened you?
- Yes. But that's not the problem.
You know them...
They mentionned my family.
You see?
What do yo uwant me to do?
I was stuck,
I couldn't do anything.
- Goodnight François.
- Goodnight.
- They shouldn't stay here.
- I know.
And it's going to get worse
until the end, you'll see.
I forgot to tell you: there is a little
sulfamide and morfine at the back.
Very well.
Listen, I can take them
to La Barberie in the morning.
No one will find them there.
Look, I'll do that in the morning
while you're at the hospital.
I had thought about it but
I didn't dare asking.
See you tomorrow at 8.
The sooner we bring them, the better.
- When will you sleep?
- Oh, after the war!
My first is a fish,
my second is a fruit tree...
And my whole is a great French king.
- It is not possible.
- Of course it is:
Honourat I, François 1er. You see...
- That's silly.
- No, it works.
Al right everybody,
it's late.
I borrow my wife.
- When will I get her back?
- In the morning. I promise.
- Night Marcel.
- Sleep well, dear.
- I don't have any matches.
- No need of them to sleep.
Look, Clara, tomorrow morning
I'll send you all to La Barberie.
Flo, Mum, Jeanne and you.
- Why?
- It's safer.
François will drive you there.
Is that so? For Flo, your mum,
en Jeanne, it's alright. But not me.
- Of course it is.
- No.
- Yes, it is, don't be contrary.
In a few days,
when the town is freed,
I'll come and bring you back.
And after that, we'll go for a great voyage
just you and me.
The one we should have done
if there hadn't been a war.
And if you're very nice
I'll make you a baby.
Julien. The baby...
Let's make it now!
Right now!
Don't move.
...the dust of rubbles...
...to the birds Orléans
must look like a skimmer...
...the town is riddled with...
...The two towers of
the cathedral are torn...
So you're absolutely certain,
you don't want to go?
- No, dear.
- What if the town is bombed?
At our age, we don't risk anything.
- See you later.
- See you later.
My mother is so stubborn.
I never ask her anything.
For once, this is something important,
she doesn't want to hear about it
How come are we safer
at La Barberie?
Becaus, dear.
- Do you have any money?
- I've got all I need.
Anyway, you know everybody
in the village.
No problem.
Everything will be fine.
Drop me a little further.
See you tonight, François.
And you, well, see you very soon.
- I'll go to see you as soon as I can.
- Alright.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Be good.
- Yes sir!
I have no use of this scarf
and your daughter needs a jumper.
You're bored without Clara?
You stayed to look after me?
Do you know how long
I adored your father?
Each time I open a door,
I feel like I'm about to see him.
He liked to read too.
Strange... A skinny little man
who gave me a big boy like you.
Let him sleep a little more.
We're so well...
Yes...
We're so well.
But there's the hospital.
I heard that yesterday,
you've operated for 8 hours in a row.
When I'm too tired,
I'm afraid to make a mistake.
I'm not worried, with these hands
you perform miracles.
- Do you mind making coffee?
- Of course not.
Finally! It looks like the end.
Quick, we must go
behind the tanks!
The partisans
could be ambushed!
What is that?
Plum or pear brandy?
- I think there's no name, sir.
- No, it's petroleum.
- It's a possibility.
- Ah, Garigue...
The Parisian, if he hasn't peed by tonight,
we probe him and then
we open him, right?.
Have a look at this!
That is the phenomenon!
And yet, within a month,
he be fine this little militian.
Yes, he is saved.
And ready for the firing squad.
Tough as he is, 12 more bullets
won't get the better of him!
Come in! Ah, miss Langrenier,
How are you, miss Langrenier?
A shot?
No? A small one?
No, thank you.
Sir...
You've got rings under your eyes,
miss Langrenier! Went to bed late, huh?
The number 12,
I think it's going to be twins.
That's perfect!
Two to go, two to come!
Such balance...
That's nature, miss Langrenier.
Goodbye, miss Langrenier.
Nice piece of ass,
miss Langrenier.
Is she good in bed?
- Oh yes, sir.
Good for her,
because for the injections
I've seen better!
Well, everyone,
you've been great.
I suppose you all have
other fish to fry. See you tomorrow.
So, what's left to do?
Ah, the amputation?
If you want, I'll take care of it.
- Yes, it suits me.
You see, they've been gone for
If at least they had a phone.
I can't stand it anymore.
I kind of noticed.
If you left now,
you could be there for lunch.
- You could be back for 5pm.
- Do you think so?
Don't you?
Yes, of course.
You're right. Let's go.
Shouldn't I, huh?
Halt! Papers!
Let him through.
What are you doing here, huh?
Come here!
Mister Florent!
Mister Florent?!
Yvonne?
Is there anybody here?
Ludwig!
Yes, Obersturmfuher.
Try again to reach
the headquarters.
Ask them if they're coming or not.
Yes, sir!
One day, I'll be old and
you will have not really looked at me.
How dare you? You're wrong.
That's all I'm doing!
You're watching me, spying on me,
that's different.
You're wrong, I tell you.
You've got nerves.
I deprive myself of sleeping
to watch you sleep!
Liar!.
- What do you mean, liar??
- Not every night.
No, not every night.
Will you forgive me?
What if I don't?
Jeanne, have you seen Madam?
I just passed her.
She was on her way to the cellar.
What's wrong?
What's happening?
Huh?
Nothing. I don't know.
You don't want to tell me?
- Someone has upset you?
- No, no.
So what?
I don't know...
I got sad, all of a sudden.
Why sad?
Don't know why...
I got scared.
- Scared of what?
- I don't know.
That hurt me.
It is over.
- Over?
- Yes, it's over.
Maybe it's because
I drank too much. I...
I'm a little too happy.
Must be it, right?
- Yes, maybe.
- Do you understand?
Do you see, Julien
that is buckshot.
From headquarters
in Montauban.
Is there an answer?
No answer.
The Colonel has been killed.
No one from general staff
is covering up for us.
No one will find out.
We have to catch up
with our unit in Perigueux.
and from there,
the Normandie front.
About the village, we'll say that
a group of Partisans
has attacked us.
Until the end of the war...
I found a projector.
- I have the same in Munich.
- Give me a hand here.
Lights!
Et voilà, we have
a first class screen!
Don't you ever dance?
- I can't dance.
- What a pity.
I'm sorry.
- We could have flirted?
- I can't flirt.
I wish they'd never stop playing.
They are going to play all night.
So you'll hear them just as well
from your bed.
To bed, miss big bundle.
Give me your glasses.
What is it?
You're not well?
Are you unhappy?
Why did mummy leave you?
It's quite a story.
Because she met another man.
He was very handsome so she loved him.
So she left with him.
That's all I can tell you.
But it is not sad, you know,
because she is very happy...
...and me too,
because I have you.
What about Clara?
You like her, don't you?
Yes. She is like my sister.
It's as if you had two daughters.
Good night, pumpkin.
Will Clara come to say good night?
- Has she ever forgotten?
- No.
Dad, when is your next leave?
Very soon.
I promise.
Come on, go to sleep,
miss big bundle.
- Is he courting you again?
- Yes.
How do you feel about it?
- It is very pleasant.
- Ah.
- Really?
- Yes.
Are you jealous?
Bloody pipes.
Fucking country!
Fucking war!
- Get lost, drunkard!
- Yes sir.
What kind of sloppiness is this,
Wake up immediately! Attention!
From now on, the vehicules
must be guarded around the clock!
There could be Partisans
in the neighbourhood!
- You two will take the watch immediately!
- Yes, sir!
It's about time,
you're late.
Prize of religious instruction,
miss Bézac.
Let all the pupils of 5A class
who will hear their name
come here with us!
Miss Dandieu, awarded 7 times,
nominated twice.
Congratulations!
Miss Lenqueteau, awarded twice,
nominated once.
Too late!
It's just over!
Sorry dear, I was on time,
was I not?
I didn't sleep at the hospital,
but we got a flat tire.
Is that true?
Look at my hands:
full of dust and dirty grease.
When I wanted to find the gloves,
your mother had used them
- ...to clip the rosetrees...
- Hush about your hands...
- Look, Award for Excellence!
- And History!
History too?
Oh, Cyrano de Bergerac,
all my youth.
Prince, pray Heaven for your soul's weal!
I move a pace--lo, such! and such!
Cut over--feint!
What ho! You reel?
At the envoi's end, I touch!
- Sorry, sister.
- You look cheerful, Doctor.
Well yes, Sister Amlie
it's celebration day!
Ah, our Julien...
Herman! Get tis dunghill to start!
Speed up the leaving!
It's taking too long!
Hurry! Faster!
Attention! Faster!
- Fill the jerrycans with water!
- Yes, sir!
- Friedrich has disappeared!
- He was here!
Idiot!
You want to follow him?
Back to the tank.
Friedrich is dead.
There must be Partisans down there.
The Obersturmfuhrer
wants us all back in the tanks.
It's one of our divisions.
They're leaving.
Try to reach them.
Stop them and tell them
to wait for us.
- Very well.
Ludwig!
Let's go!
The bridge is broken!
The Partisans are surrounding us!
Fall back! Shut the doors!
Beware, the window!
Take one alive, for interrogation!
This way!
He must be here!
I saw him!
Let's hunt him down!
Here!
We're going to get him!
The other side!
- We've been here already.
- He is in the well.
Let's go this way.
Partisan,
follow me to the castle!
The Hauptsturmfuhrer
wants to talk to you.
Come on! Hurry!
Turn around!
GO to the door, hurry!
Faster! Faster!
More Partisans...
Hide!
Complete silence.
Shoot only on my command.
Anybody there?
Search the houses.
Luc, come with me.
This is incredible.
They weren't signaled on any road.
- They are probobly still in the castle.
- Chief! Look.
It's Doctor Dandieu.
What are you doing here?
Are you alone?
Yes.
And your family?
They are in town.
I got here after...
I couldn't do anything.
I hid when I saw them.
When did they leave?
How many of them?
A dozen.
They took the road to...
- Chief! I found a dead one!
They must have fought back.
Do you want to come with us?
No, thank you.
That's not very reasonable.
And it can be dangerous,
they may come back.
Anyway, as you wish.
You won't be alone for long,
I'll tell the people
from Mauricot.
Two men on the tank!
Take aim at the entrance!
The others to the ravine!
Do you have everything?
Follow me.
- Here, tie the rope.
- Yes, Haubtsturmfuhrer.
Wolfgang, you go first.
Julien
The child...
Wouldn't you like
to make him now?
If it's a boy,
we'll name him David.
There, a Partisan on the terrace!
Throw a grenade at him!
We're trapped.
The Partisans are surrounding us.
Boys, the game is over.
Our comrades are probably
too far away.
We'll never...
We'll never see Germany again.
All we have left to do...
...but to sell our souls
for the highest price.
- For the Fhrer! And for Fatherland!
- Heil Hitler!
...some attacks by
the Soviet-Jew radio...
...not a word about
the suffering...
...not a word about
the displaced populations...
...people of Normandie,
dispelled from your homes...
... and you, thousands of
innocent missing or deads ...
...and you who will soon discover
the "joys" of the Liberation...
What the hell is she doing?
She could have told us!
She probably didn't want to drive
at night? She'll be here in the morning.
It is the morning.
It is tomorrow morning!
Don't be silly. 5:30 am.
It's not the morning yet.
Don't get smart.
You're right.
- You know, François...
- What?
She is so alive,
so unpredictable.
Everything has happened so fast,
between us...
I'm always scared that one day
she might leave.
- You can't take anything for granted!
- No. That's why you love her!.
Where have you been?
A big detour
and then I got lost.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Don't be mad at me,
I have a surprise for you.
- Peek-a-boo!
- What is she doing  here?
- Why aren't you at school?
- It's closed.
Requisitionings. We saw
so many refugees on the road..
- He was getting mad without you.
- Why?
And that's not all.
- What is that?
- That is Marcel.
- We've named him Marcel.
- Where does he come from, Marcel?
He was all alone along the road.
So I stopped,
we looked at each other
and he got in.
Alright?
Come, Marcel.
I've found an exit!
In the basement,
there is an exit to the village.
Haubtsturmfuhrer!
A Partisan! Aaah!
A Partisan!
There, in the bedroom.
Search everywhere.
And hurry up!!
Here is another room.
He can't have just
vanished into thin air!
He is here, they're here.
I'm sure of it.
- My friend Julien.
- Good evening.
- Please, have a seat.
- Thank you. Excuse me.
Well, er...
I have to give a phone call.
- I am very thirsty.
- What do you want?
- A glass of Champagne.
- Make it two, please.
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm a surgeon, like François.
and I live in the country,
like François.
All like François. But,
I don't know him that well, you know.
- Which region?
- In the South, downwards.
Take a right as you go down.
It's called Le Quercy.
I also have a castle,
a sort of castle, anyway.
I am restoring it.
- Whenever I have the time.
- That's good.
And you... What do you do?
Me? Nothing.
- Nothing at all?
- No.
Anyway, I'm trying.
It's not easy.
Thank you.
Dank u.
- You're rich?
- No, not at all.
I work now and then,
when I'm broke.
I help a friend
who owns a bookshop.
I used to make costume jewelry
for a fashion designer.
And then...
Why?
Are you interested?
- What?
- I don't know, me?
Why are you looking
at me like that?
- I love you.
- You're mad.
No.
And now...
You still love me.
Am I right?
Are you happier?
Or is it over?
For me it is over.
Not because you're not handsome.
It has nothing to do with it.
It was...
Very nice.
But I don't like men
to whom I give myself right away...
I don't like that.
That's not your fault.
It's mine.
It's a misunderstanding.
I'm sorry.
Eh!
You're already back
to your province?
Clara,
The news are bad, I really think
there's going to be a war.
I don't give a damn.
Do you want to marry me?
Where is Walter?
He was here a minute ago.
Hurry up!
Are you trying to escape
dressed as a civilian?
Deserter!
Dirty pig.
Klaus!
Help!
Klaus!
Come, it's not far.
Here! Here!
Light!
Who's there?
Help!
Water! Water!
Help!
The water rises!
Where is the dog?
Marcel.
Marcel the dog.
Rien.
Clara must have taken him
in her car.
Are you coming
for dinner tonight?
What's wrong?
If you prefer...
...I could be replaced
at the hospital.
So I could stay with you
for a few days.
Yes, if you want.
Clara likes when you come
to visit us.
- Julien...
- What?
But...
What is it?
What have I...
What...
