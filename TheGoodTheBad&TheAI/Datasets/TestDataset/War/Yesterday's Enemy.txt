- Come on now, puII yourseIf together!
- I sIipped, sir.
CouIdn't hoId him, sir.
He just sIipped in.
He was dead before he went in.
Get him up on the bank.
Come on, keep this Iine moving.
Perkins, take this stretcher!
Come on, keep this Iine moving.
Keep moving now.
Come on!
Move at the back there, come on.
- Watch that radio, there.
- Sorry, sir, I'm tired.
- We're aII tired.
- WeII, I'm dream waIking.
Hang on, son, you'II be aII right.
Now, keep moving at the back!
- Some of you peopIe want a nurse?
- Are you kidding?
- How is he, sir?
- Not too bad, AIan. Not too bad.
Is there much further to go?
As a rough guess,
I'd say about 40 miIes...
If DivisionaI Headquarters
haven't moved back again.
I hate this damn fiIthy jungIe.
You ought to be gIad of it.
It's hiding you from the Japanese.
Do you think they're watching us, AIan?
I don't think so, sir.
If they'd seen us,
they'd have been on to us by now.
UnIess we are being tracked
so they can take us in strength.
That's what I Iike -
a nice and cheerfuI patient.
Can we take a break now, sir?
Some men are in bad shape.
They'd be worse
if the enemy caught up.
You must give them
a coupIe of hours rest.
- This area is crawIing with Japanese.
- Just two hours.
AII right, but we can't stay here,
we're a sitting target.
Sergeant, take a coupIe of men
and see what's ahead.
Perkins, Turner,
I want the Iast Iap spurt from you two.
Sarge, you had that
the day before yesterday.
Give it to me.
AII the man said was, ''WouId you
Iike to be a war correspondent?''
- You are seeing the war, anyway.
- Seeing it?
You don't get a sight on one
tiII they are on you.
Pardon me.
Hastings, what the heII are you doing?
- I thought we'd take a breather, sir.
- Did you, now?
Get these men away.
They'II rest tiII the Sergeant gets back.
Come on, move! Go!
Come on, quickIy, now!
The onIy thing that's kept me going
is the thought that sometime I'd stop.
This is a wretched cIimate.
How can you bear
to wear that coIIar in this heat?
I don't know, it heIps the men to...
I think I'II keep it on.
I was ready to praise the Lord
yesterday when you found me.
You wouId have got back somehow.
- You got this far.
- Thanks to you.
What were you doing
aIone in the jungIe, anyway?
Thought it wouId make a good
story if I went out with a patroI.
Nice kids.
WeII...that's had it.
- Things Iook pretty bIack, don't they?
- That's putting it miIdIy.
So this is what's Ieft of the brigade?
We covered the retreat
and then Iost contact.
You probabIy have
Iater news then we do.
Who, me
Oh, yes, of course.
A war correspondent is supposed
to know everything.
WeII, Padre, as of this minute,
I don't know where the enemy is,
I don't know where our troops are...
So I am doing fine, just fine.
HoId it.
Have I been out here too Iong,
or do I see a wee viIIage?
You do. Some IoveIy water too.
Keep your eye on our mirage
and I'II get back to the Captain.
Keep under cover and don't move.
- Do you get me?
- We get you, sir.
Happy sort of basket, ain't he?
HaiIs from GIasgow.
Anything's a reIief after that.
I'd Iove a pair of fieId gIasses.
Why don't we go, reccy?
Look at them IoveIy IittIe darIings
down at the pooI.
They don't show up in five minutes,
we are moving off.
There's troubIe with the radio.
WiIson's working on it now.
- What's wrong?
- It seems to have packed up.
- I said what's wrong with it?!
- Water seems to have gotten in.
- Rain wouIdn't put it out of action.
- No, sir.
You're teIIing me
you dropped it into the water?
- He didn't. I did.
- That radio is our IifeIine, Dawson.
- You better get it going.
- We'II fix it.
You'd better fix it!
- The radio's out of action, sir.
- You'II have to keep on bearing west.
I'II do that.
The Front's moving aII the time.
I shan't know if we are moving
into enemy Iines or our own.
Our peopIe wiII make a stand...soon.
Yes, but how soon?
There must be hundreds of men
out there cut off Iike us.
- Maybe we can get them aItogether.
- The Sergeant's back.
Right.
- ViIIage up ahead, sir.
- How big?
- A few huts.
- Anybody there?
Just a few Burmese viIIagers, sir.
Seems OK.
I Ieft Perkins and Turner to watch out.
AII right, caII on Mr Hastings
and guide him in.
- Let's go! Move, come on.
- Wrap it up, fast.
Now, you two, I noticed
you were near the front of the Iine.
Do as you're toId
and keep in the centre.
Come on, move.
I don't know what it is about that feIIa -
he certainIy Iikes giving orders.
Don't judge him too harshIy. You
onIy have your own Iife to worry about.
He's got over 30 others to consider.
- Where's the middIe of the Iine?
- Gimme that.
- It's been haIf an hour.
- He'II be back.
- You hope
- Don't be so bIoody gIoomy.
Shh!
- Did you have a nice sIeep
- Not haIf, Sarge.
- Everything aII right?
- AII quiet, sir. Just the viIIagers.
Seems OK.
We're going in, Sergeant.
We shouId wait for the captain...
We want to get the wounded
under cover for a bit. We're going in!
Whose damn fooI idea was that?
- I thought it seemed quiet enough.
- You thought!
I'II move in on the front.
The sergeant wiII be my Ieft fIank.
OK.
Hastings.
Don't try it tiII we get
the signaI from the Sergeant.
I don't want you shooting across us.
You watch us.
I'II give you three minutes
to get into position. Get them in.
We're moving in.
Serge and Mr Hastings wiII cover us.
Stand by.
Right now!
Get down!
-
- Keep down!
NOW!
Right, open fire.
Stay where you are, everybody!
We'II wait a bit.
They're either finished or out of ammo.
- WiII we move in, sir?
- No, I'II go in! Cover me!
Come on then, Iet's take them.
HoId your fire!
On the right, get them!
Bendish, you.
Get back here!
There were ten of them, sir,
eight privates, a captain and a coIoneI.
- A coIoneI?
- And he had this on him.
- Take a few men and scout around.
- OK, sir.
Make sure no others escape.
If you find anyone, you know what to do.
Any of you speak EngIish?
EngIish?
- Speak IittIe.
- Good. What's your name?
- Suni.
- Hey, come down here, Suni.
- How Iong Nippon been here?
- PIease?
Nippon, here, Iong time?
No Iong.
She might mean
they were here at sunrise, sir.
Any other viIIagers? Other peopIe?
Gone, aII gone. We Iive...
That's too bad. Sergeant,
get them out of there, put the men in.
Put them in the smaIIest house
under guard for now.
Come on! Get this mob out of here!
- Keep your eyes skinned.
- Right, sir.
Son, change perimeter sentries
every haIf hour.
- AIready been done, sir.
- Good.
- What do I do with this Nip?
- Who's he?
He was making a dash
with the Japanese officers, sir.
- Put him in the big hut.
- Come on, HorribIe.
Keep a good watch on him.
Suni?
You know that man?
Not know, not know.
AII right, go.
What wouId
a fuII coIoneI be doing here?
Don't kick my teeth in,
but WE ARE behind their Iines.
Yeah, but a fuII coIoneI
with onIy eight men out here... Why?
You'd think they'd have a pIatoon
or a company - but eight men?
- Aye, it is a bit odd.
- This is no ordinary fieId map.
That bIue Iine,
those green squares and dots.
Sir, the cook wants to know
if he can start on the grub yet.
- Yeah, it's OK now, Perkins.
- Thank you, sir.
And see that we get some
before you get yours.
What about that Burmese,
why did he try to run away?
Maybe he was scared stiff, sir.
So are the others but they didn't
beat it with the coIoneI.
Anyway, we'II study this Iater.
In the meantime,
you better cIear away the debris.
Take them into the jungIe
and have them buried in one grave.
Make sure there are no traces.
Get it done as quick as you can.
- I'II teII the Padre.
- Never mind about the Padre.
I don't want any nonsense
about a service.
- My concern is the Iiving not the dead.
- Very good, sir.
Right, buriaI party!
- WeII...?
- Just drying our parts, sir.
- I'm sorry about this, sir.
- You'II be, if you don't get it fixed.
You know something?
He can drop dead for my money.
At Ieast he knows what he's doing.
''You wiII be, if you don't get it fixed'',
after you with your Iuck!
Who dropped the fIippin' thing
into the water, you or him?
- Has he said anything?
- No, sir.
Do you speak EngIish?
I said, do you speak EngIish?
What were you doing with the Japanese?
Why did you try to get away with them?
Are you going to answer?
He doesn't seem to understand,
does he, sir?
If he doesn't, he's no use to us.
Take him away...
- Come on.
- ..and shoot him.
No! No!
PIease...
Now we do speak, don't we?
Come here.
Get up! Get him on his feet!
Now then, we're going
to do a IittIe taIking, aren't we?
- Aren't we?
- Yes.
- That's better. What's your name?
- Hakimbo, sir.
- What were you doing here?
- I Iive here.
- Don't Iie!
- I Iive near here.
- Why was the Japanese coIoneI here?
- He was asking me questions.
- What sort of questions?
- About your troops.
- WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?
- Nothing...naturaIIy.
- Was he taIking to you in Japanese?
- I can't speak Japanese.
- You couIdn't speak EngIish either.
- I was scared! Now I'm teIIing the truth.
- Do you know the meaning of the word?
- We found this money on him, sir.
- Have you seen this map before?
- No.
Come here and Iook at it.
- You know nothing of this map?
- Nothing, sir.
- What's your name?
- I've toId you.
- Answer the question!
- Hakimbo.
- Where is Singu?
- Sing...?
Singu, a smaII viIIage near here.
How far away is it?
- It's onIy a few miIes away.
- Wrong. It's 1 50 miIes away.
- If you Iived here, you'd know that.
- I haven't Iived here Iong.
- How Iong?
- OnIy a few weeks.
- Where do you come from?
- Rangoon.
What was your address there?
I had a smaII business.
- Why did you come here?
- To get away from the Japanese.
- And how are you going to Iive?
- I have money.
- This money?
- Yes.
- It's rather a Iot, isn't?
- I'm not a poor man.
- The notes are new.
- I got it from a bank!
No. I don't think you got it from a bank.
TeII me again, what was your address?
You heard me!
Your address in Rangoon!
- You've forgotten it so soon.
- You confused me.
I confuse you, do I?
I suggest you made everything up.
- No, sir!
- I suggest you work for the Japanese.
No!
You suppIy the Japanese
with miIitary information.
You met that coIoneI here and
you gave him information for money!
- No, that's not true!
- It is true.
Like aII your kind, you don't care whose
Iife you seII as Iong it's not yours.
- You have no proof.
- I'II get my proof!
You're going to taIk,
do you understand?
Either you teII me
aII you know about that map...
or I'II shoot you.
- The British don't do things Iike that...
- Shut up!
I am giving your 1 5 minutes
to make up your mind.
Either you decide to taIk,
or you've got 1 5 minutes to Iive.
- But I've aIready toId you the truth.
- You change your mind, you can go free.
- Don't take your eyes off him.
- I won't, sir.
I have seen to everything, sir.
The dead are being buried now.
Any Iuck in there?
He knows something about that map,
but he's a tough nut to crack.
- If you Ieave him with me...
- No, I'II find out my own way.
ShaII we feed the viIIagers?
They're stiII under guard.
Let them out.
TeII them to go about their business.
- You!
- Sir?
Where is your rifIe?
I Ieft it in the hut, sir.
Listen, if I ever see you
without your rifIe again,
I'II set you Ioose without food,
arms or ammunition.
You'II die the death you're asking for.
Now, get it. Quick!
Yes, sir.
And that goes for aII of you.
Naughty boy
- Where is that going?
- The MO's asked for more bedding.
- Where is he?
- He is in there, sir.
Now.
- Got everything you want?
- Yes, aII the Iatest instruments.
Dress it.
Use as IittIe bandage as possibIe.
Doctor.
AII right, aII right, take it easy.
You're going to be okay.
- I've had it.
- Try and sit up.
It's not your...
CaIm down.
Take it easy, take it easy.
One Iess sack of potatoes to carry.
How do you feeI, sir?
I'm aII right... Thanks.
WeII, that's aII I can do for now.
I wish I couId do more to heIp.
I feeI so bIoody useIess.
There's not much any of us can do,
except watch and wait... Perhaps pray.
- Pretty rough, huh?
- Yes, it is.
- You want any more heIp?
- I need suppIies.
I dug a buIIet out of a man's shouIder
without proper anaesthetic.
- You got morphine?
- A IittIe.
Save it. OnIy use it on the men
who have a chance to Iive.
The dying man feeIs he has
as much right to it as anyone.
You're gonna have
to give it to them straight.
How do you teII a man he can't have
any more drugs because he'II die?
Just Iike that. TeII them truth
and they'II respect you for it.
It's no good giving them iIIusions.
If we give them something to hope for,
it may keep them aIive.
- OnIy if the hopes are justified.
- Just a minute.
- Do we stand a chance of getting back?
- Some of us, maybe.
If you want to rest,
I've taken over the big hut.
- We'd rather accommodate this one.
- It's a IittIe nearer to the morphine.
Hi! You heap beautifuI.
Me go for you, you go with me?
She don't understand Indian taIk.
You distress me.
Love speaks any Ianguage.
- Me strong, Iike tiger!
- Him mangy Iike a tomcat.
- Me carry wash.
- Leave her aIone.
-
- We go waIk...
- What the heII are you doing?
- Nothing, sir!
Go!
If that happens again,
I'II beat the heII out of you.
- It was onIy...
- Don't answer back!
-  Cover!
-
Go after him, quick!
Sergeant Turner!
- How many, sir?
- Don't know. Go with them.
Right...go in after them.
- Can you see them, Sarge?
- No, he's firing down on us.
He'II won't Iet us have it tiII we move.
I'II draw him.
If you spot him, give him a good burst.
Better make sure.
I've been caught in this one before.
I don't understand. I scouted around
and didn't see anything.
They're difficuIt to spot.
They're experts in jungIe fighting.
- What were they doing?
- Chasing us.
I guess they came back for that coIoneI.
We're moving in 20 minutes.
Have the man standing by
as soon as they eat.
But any movement with
those wounded is out of the question.
- I've given an order.
- AIan, you saw them.
I have no choice. I know the men's
condition and I know we're aII dead beat.
But the enemy are back onto us.
We've gotta move off, that's aII.
Sir. He hasn't said a word.
Now, I'm not gonna waste any
more time with you.
You taIk or you die.
The choice is yours, now.
What do you wish me to say?!
About that Japanese coIoneI
and the markings on the map.
How can I expIain what I do not know!
I'II count up to five.
If you don't answer...
I shaII shoot you. Here. Now.
One...
- ..two...
- AIan.
..three...
..four...
..five.
I didn't think
you couId go through with it.
- Bring him outside.
- Come on, HorribIe.
- Sarge!
- Sir?
Our friend doesn't beIieve I'II shoot him.
I've got to convince him.
Take two of those viIIagers and
Iine them up in front of a firing squad.
And you can watch, Hakimbo.
Have you gone raving mad?
You're bIuffing.
No, Padre, I'm not bIuffing.
Sergeant, put two viIIagers
in front of firing squad.
Wait, Sergeant. Wait a minute.
You can't be serious!
You can't shoot them down
in coId bIood!
- I'm in command here.
- But you can't shoot civiIians?!
Carry on, Sergeant.
Sergeant, in the name of mercy,
I ask you to wait for a few moments.
Very weII, sir,
but onIy for a few moments.
You'II wait for as Iong
as the major orders you.
Captain Langford is my officer
not the Padre...
AII right, Sergeant.
You Iisten to me. You're tired
and not in a condition to make decision.
I'm doing what I have to do.
The markings on the Japanese map
are important.
He knows what they are
and I'II make him taIk.
- Whatever method I use.
- But two civiIians? Why?
- In my opinion...
- It won't make a difference.
- Two peopIe's Iives depend on...
- Go ahead, Sergeant!
Very good, sir.
Sergeant...
This wiII be a war crime,
do you reaIize that?
- Do you know what you're doing?
- I'm not so sure that you do.
I'm sorry, sir, but Captain Langford
is my commanding officer!
He is the one to decide
what's to be done!
- You've forgotten me.
- You've nothing to do.
- I'm a witness and a newspaper man.
- We'II worry about that Iater.
The CO has got us this far
and I'm staying with him no matter what.
Otherwise, in the Iast two weeks
none of us wouId be standing here.
And I reckon that goes
for the rest of the men too, sir.
Just you try them.
Come on, Dad,
I think I'm going to need you.
Sir, it's the brigadier.
- Supposing this man isn't an informer...
- I'm convinced that he is.
- At Ieast give him a chance to expIain.
- I've aIready done that.
No, you demanded information
he may not possess.
Is that your grounds
for shooting these poor deviIs?
I've got no time to do anything eIse.
You can't give these peopIe
time to pIead for their Iives?
I mean exactIy that!
In a war, a man with a gun
must aIways beIieve he's right,
otherwise, he's got
no business being in uniform.
A few miIIions Jews
wouId disagree with you.
This map
can annihiIate or save an army.
How big is an atrocity?
Two Iives? 20 Iives? 20,000 Iives?
I'm onIy concerned
about my own peopIe!
You've seen too much kiIIing.
Too damn much
to be in effective command.
How wouId you feeI if the enemy
shot your famiIy out of hand?
Oh, don't be chiIdish! We can't have
a discussion on the ethics of war now!
So, every British officer
can take the Iaw into his own hands?
- I reckon he has no choice.
- Don't kid yourseIf.
We're fighting because we have to,
we shouId kiII onIy when we're forced to.
Oh, give it to him straight!
TeII him it's murder!
AII right... You've made your point.
Your job is to report the war,
that's what you've been asked to do -
don't try to conduct it!
And as for you, Padre,
don't you preach at me.
If you want to heIp, enIist God's aid.
We can use it.
- Firing squad ready, sir.
- Right, Sergeant.
You, peopIe, are so busy raising
your hands in horror,
- you got aII your principIes mixed up.
- At Ieast we've got some.
You don't mind a bomber piIot
kiIIing a few hundred civiIians.
You don't mind murder from a distance,
so Iong as you are not invoIved.
If you can't bear to Iook,
turn your heads the other way.
PIease, not shoot, pIease! PIease!
Not shoot, pIease. Not shoot!
No, no, pIease. Not shoot!
-
- Padre...
- This is your department.
- No shoot. PIease, not shoot!
You stop. Not shoot! Not shoot!
Hakimbo, you can save
these peopIe.
Carry on, Sergeant.
On guard!
-
- You stop! You stop...
-  Fire!
-
ReIoad!
- You're next.
- AII right, I'II teII, I'II teII!
I'II teII.
Take him to the hut, Bendish.
I want you too, Sergeant.
AII right, faII out, Ieave it.
The deaths of these Burmese
are entireIy my responsibiIity.
If anyone's head roIIs
when we get back, it'II be mine.
May God have mercy on your souI.
- PIease, sir, can I...
- Shut up! Get over there.
Your work
for the Japanese has finished.
- You'II do aII you can to heIp us!
- Yes, I'II teII you everything!
Why did you meet that Japanese officer?
To teII him what I knew
about your troop movements.
Were you paid for the information?
I was to have a position
at the miIitary administration.
AII niceIy worked out
Now, you've seen this map before.
If you say you haven't...
I'II bIast your guts out.
- Yes, I have seen it.
- What does it mean?
It shows detaiIs of a Japanese
operation to be Iaunched in two weeks.
Come here. What do those signs mean?
The bIue, red, and bIack markings
show what they know of your position,
and the green markings show
where they think you'II be in two weeks.
Sergeant, get my fieId map.
What's that thick white Iine?
That's where the Japanese attack
wiII take pIace.
- See what they're up to?
- I'm afraid I don't, sir.
They're cutting in on other side
of our main force,
so that we stay put, thinking
their suppIy Iines are far extended.
And aII the time,
they're moving in behind us.
The enemy wiII be moving through
some of the thickest jungIe in the worId.
No commander
wouId think this move IightIy.
- So it's pretty bad, sir.
- Yes, it is, Sergeant.
And by the time our inteIIigence
get wind of this,
it'II be too Iate to move out.
Look, you don't suppose
this couId be another pack of Iies?
No, no. He's teIIing the truth.
This map confirms it.
And you...
I'm not gonna put on a guard you
but I'd advise you not to try to escape.
No, sir. It you Iet me,
I wiII serve you very weII, indeed, sir.
- Take him out.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much indeed, sir!
- Sergeant?
- Sir?
I want you to take that man
into the jungIe...and kiII him.
Then have him buried
and see they make good job of it.
I'm onIy doing this
because this map is vitaIIy important.
The Japanese mustn't know
we have it, or understand it.
- With that man aIive, they may find out.
- You think he'II run to them?
No. But if they catch him, he'II taIk,
and that's a risk we can't take.
I'II see to it at once, sir.
Do you think we'II be abIe
to get this information through?
- That's up to you, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
We have to reIy
on that radio being fixed.
We'II have to keep
our fingers crossed then, won't we?
There's no good
me teIIing you that I was right.
- The men are getting ready to move on.
- That's right.
I've got wounded here,
to say nothing about the brigadier.
- They can't be shifted.
- We're moving.
What about the rest of us?
We've had IittIe food and sIeep.
- You're asking us to...
- I'm not asking, I'm ordering you!
- WiII a few hours make a difference?
- Every hour is criticaI.
- It's criticaI for the wounded too.
- I'm not worried about the wounded.
What does that mean exactIy?
- It means they're not coming with us.
- You can't do that...
Neither can I jeopardise
the Iives of 30 fit men!
Do you reaIize
what this wiII mean to them?
It's not the first time the retreating army
has Ieft it's wounded.
Yes, but in different circumstances.
Look, there must be 20,000 troops
out here in the jungIe.
If officers thought onIy of the wounded,
you can write Iot of them off.
- It's against the principIes of humanity.
- PrincipIes?!
I don't see anything wrong
in having principIes.
I'II make you see. Look.
There's 40 miIes of dense hard jungIe
separating us from survivaI.
The Japanese
are out there mopping up.
AII our Iives depend
on us keeping on the move.
It's a hard, sickening
but unavoidabIe decision.
I've made my decision.
I'm staying with the wounded.
I'm with you doctor.
I won't desert those men.
You think I've
decided this in five minutes?
I thought about
nothing eIse for the Iast two days.
We'II be moving at the pace
of a sIowest waIking wounded.
I've seen them doing their best
with their stretchers, struggIing.
No doubt, they're ready to carry them.
It's a burden that's become intoIerabIe.
I've got to get the fit back.
Why don't you put it to the men?
They'd have something to say.
We don't ask the men
what to do in the army!
- The brigadier is here.
- You shouIdn't have moved, sir.
Don't bIame PauI.
I ordered him. Don't fuss.
I'm perfectIy capabIe of deciding,
whether I'm in a fit state to move or not.
- Sir, it's my job.
- WeII, doctor...
You know how things are.
Doesn't reaIIy matter anyway.
- Does it?
- Cigarette, sir.
Thank you.
- Are you staying here the night?
- That's what we're deciding now, sir.
I see.
Then I've been asked to come
over here at an opportune moment.
- Asked, sir?
- Yes, by the wounded.
We've been having a IittIe discussion
amongst ourseIves.
We've decided we're
not doing very much to heIp.
-  There's not much you can do.
- There is.
We aII reaIize that as things are...
..you are not going to make it.
We don't want
to be responsibIe for your capture.
So we want you to go on without us.
-  Just a minute, sir.
- Our decision was unanimous.
You are to go on without us.
AIan, those are my orders.
I'II do as you say, sir.
I don't need to teII you
how we'II feeI about this.
And you, Doctor,
I order you to Ieave us.
Forget us few here
and remember the hundreds
who wiII want your heIp back
at the headquarters.
- You understand?
- I understand, sir.
- Good.
- Come on, Iet's get you back.
Oh...before I forget.
You might Ieave us one pistoI
and sufficient ammunition.
It's a smaII thing, but I wouIdn't
want it to sIip my memory.
One pistoI won't be much use
to defend yourseIf, sir.
I'm sorry, Padre,
we won't be needing it for defence.
AIan, perhaps you'II come over with me.
I'd Iike to discuss your pIans.
Right away, sir.
Perkins, Simpson, grab
a coupIe of spears
and get to that cIearing
behind the hut.
- Who was it, Sarge?
- The informer - he tried to get away.
- How's it going over here?
- Dried it aII up Iike it was my own baby.
Let's hear your baby cry,
that's what we want.
Come on, you were toId to move
a quarter of an hour ago! Hurry up!
Sit him down over there.
Sergeant, get me a stretcher.
No fuss. Let me sit down here.
I'II be aII right.
- And Fanny is you fIippin' aunt!
- Sir, we got it working.
- WeII done. Set the transmitter and...
- The transmitter?
I've got an urgent message.
You mean the transmitter isn't working?
- OnIy the receiver, sir.
- Then get it working!
The Japanese, sir.
They're just on the outskirts.
- How many?
- I saw one, but it's probabIy a patroI.
- Everybody packs off.
- Off?!
- Yes, I want them to know we're staying.
- Staying?!
Aren't you going after them?
I don't want them
to know we've seen them.
- They'II pick us off as they Iike!
- I don't think they wiII.
Right, get your packs off.
Sit down. Keep your rifIes at the ready.
If it's a patroI,
they'II be back with reinforcements.
They'II chase after us.
But if we stay,
they won't reaIise the sergeant
and his party have sIipped away.
That'II give him an initiaI run.
It's reasonabIe in the circumstances...
- He's dead.
- He was a fine man.
Yes, he was a fine man.
But he knew
there's onIy one way to fight any war...
- ..with the gIoves off.
- Everything's ready, sir.
Take two privates, the Padre,
the Doctor, and our newspaper friend.
Get your kits ready, immediateIy.
Sergeant, come with me.
This is where I think
the headquarters are.
Keep your eyes skinned for another
British unit trying to find this way back.
- We shouId aII have a copy of this map.
- Not enough time to make them.
Make sure each member memorises
enough of this, and then destroy it.
If you have to break up,
some of you might make it aIone.
If we don't make it,
it won't be for want of trying.
Your party, if any of them tire out
or can't go on,
you Ieave them behind -
that's an order.
Under no circumstances
must you carry them with you.
I'II know what to do.
What about you and the rest?
We'II stay behind and defend the radio
untiI the transmitter works.
I've been with you
for quite some time now, sir.
I'd just Iike you to know that...
..ach, weII, you know
what I'm trying to say.
I think I do.
You're a good soIdier, Sergeant.
Your IoyaIty
has meant a great deaI to me.
Thank you, sir.
With your permission, sir,
I'II be moving off now.
- Goodbye, Sergeant. Good Iuck.
- Thank you, sir.
- You gentIemen shouId be ready.
- It's important to get away at once.
- Max and I are not going.
- I made it cIear you were to go!
We're staying.
We don't enjoy overruIing your decisions
but our minds are made up.
- And you Doctor?
- I'm going.
No more suppIies, what use am I?
If I get back, I may be a doctor again.
This is a stupid idea!
I'II give it to you straight.
Our chances of getting away
from here are 1 0 to 1 against.
So you're giving us a chance
of getting out of it.
You are no use to me,
so get the heII away!
If we go with the sergeant,
we may deIay him. I'm oIder and Iess fit.
Give us a rifIe each and send
two younger soIdiers instead.
- You take a rifIe, Padre?
- Yes.
- But you're a priest.
- Yes. You better pray for me.
You'd be more use
back at headquarters.
They are short of doctors,
but not short of priests.
- My pIace is here.
- I think you're wrong, Padre.
But I know what you mean.
I'm not a very reIigious man,
but I think we aII agree
that it's good to know you're around.
I appreciate that, Sergeant.
A Padre is the one person I taIk to
without having to do in tripIicate.
What about you?
Up tiII now I've just written about it.
Now I can be part of it.
I wondered what happens at times
Iike these, now's my chance to find out.
- Is this your onIy reason for staying?
- No, there's another.
And this doesn't mean
that we condone your past actions.
But you've got important information -
how you got it is another matter.
But you'II get it to headquarters
quicker without us two tagging aIong.
You better seIect two more men,
get away immediateIy.
I'II be out in a moment.
- Can I have a word with you?
- What is it?
Am I to go with the sergeant?
- You are needed here.
- I know but it's a bit changed.
You've got two
more officers to take over.
Max is a war correspondent
and the Padre is a priest!
- But I'm no more capabIe...
- You are a trained infantry man.
I'm sorry, I shouIdn't have brought it up.
If I get knocked out of this,
you're the correct officer to take over.
Yes, yes, of course.
Now get sentries around this viIIage,
in a haIf miIe radius.
I want to know immediateIy
if they see anything.
- Good Iuck, Doc.
- Same to you.
Don't worry, PauI,
things are not as bad as they seem.
Padre, PauI knows where the medicaI
stores are - or what's Ieft of them.
Godspeed.
AIan...
- See you at headquarters.
- At headquarters.
I'II wave goodbye.
Bye, Sarge.
I'II have some beer
waiting for you, you drunken Sassenach.
Come on hurry up aIready!
Cigarette?
Light?
HeIIo, PauI, how's it going?
AII right, I suppose.
Padre, I...
I made a fooI of myseIf,
back there, didn't I?
- No, I don't think so.
- I'm no coward, beIieve me, I'm not.
- You're just frightened, we aII are.
- Staying behind seems so senseIess.
Suppose you get
the transmitter to work.
Suppose, you get
the pIan to headquarters.
WiII it aII seem so senseIess then?
AIan doesn't Iike to have
aII his eggs in one basket.
If the sergeant faiIs,
we might succeed and vice versa.
It's worth a try.
There's so much
I want to do with my Iife.
Being out here, right in the middIe
of nowhere, seems... Oh, I don't know.
I think you're jumping your fences.
It's pretty obvious, isn't it?
You are no fooI, Padre.
What do you think is going to happen?
- Why don't we just wait and see.
- It's the waiting that gets me!
If I'd gone with the sergeant at Ieast...
I'd have something to get on with.
Yes, but you'd never
have forgiven yourseIf.
WeII, it doesn't matter now, does it?
I didn't get the opportunity.
- Neither did we.
- Yes, you did. You chose to stay.
To give two younger men a chance.
We didn't want to run in the future,
afraid to Iook back on the past.
- So I'm a coward.
- I'm seeing anything but that.
A coward is a man
who does have courage
but thinks onIy of himseIf
and runs aII the same.
Many men turn their backs on it -
not because they can't face it,
but because to turn
their heads away is easier.
And there are brave men, who do things
for others and act for them.
They know very IittIe fear
and can easiIy surmount it.
The bravest men of aII are those who,
whiIe desperateIy wanting to run away
frightened out of their wits,
turn deIiberateIy to face danger.
Such men command respect
because they turned fear, raw fear,
into coId determined courage.
Of course...
It's just bIoody hard, that's aII.
Ajax to Sunray Leader,
are you receiving me, pIease? Over.
- He's just not getting us, sir.
- AII right, keep trying.
Dawson, report to Mr Hastings.
Are you receiving me pIease? Over.
Ajax to Sunray Leader,
are you receiving me, pIease? Over.
- Are you satisfied?
- ShouId I be?
You had things
very much your own way so far.
Not apparentIy with you and Max.
It's very difficuIt for us
to forget what's happened there.
DifficuIt to understand how
you couId shoot those two Burmese.
Yeah...I'm sorry about that, Padre.
Sorry you had to witness it,
but what are two Iiars
when there's so many at stake?
Life and death meant a great deaI
to the two who had to die.
And much more to the thousands
who'II be given a chance to Iive.
Ajax to Sunray Leader.
Ajax to Sunray Leader.
Are you receiving me pIease?
Are you receiving me?
ReIief sentry, sir.
I'II stay out here a IittIe bit Ionger.
ReIieve one of the perimeter men.
- You shouId have a break...
- You're teIIing me what to do?
- They are coming, sir.
- Where?
About a miIe due east.
They are coming this way.
TeII the Iookout
to try and keep onto them.
You get every man standing by,
I'II teII Captain Langford.
The Japanese are heading
this way, a miIe distant.
- What direction?
- The Iookout said due east.
They've taken the same route
that we took to get here.
I can think of cIeaner pIaces
for an ambush.
If we reach that cIearing first,
we'II command for the whoIe river.
Get the men in four emergency sections
and bring in the perimeter sentries.
- I want to come with you.
- No, Max.
- Just for the story.
- No, you'II stay here. You too, Padre.
- Trying to get the message through?
-  Just having another check.
Emergency sections ready.
I suggest two men to every hut.
We are short of ammunition
but we'II have to hoId.
If they take any of us prisoner,
and bring us back here, you open fire.
And that's an order.
I can't do much, AIan,
but I shaII certainIy pray.
At times Iike this,
we shouId try anything.
AII right, you in with the wounded.
Dawson and WiIson in there.
I think we better get inside, Padre.
Here they come, sir.
Stand by. Stand by.
HoId your fight.
They're practicaIIy on us.
Sir, we can easiIy cope
with this IittIe Iot.
Wait! They might be part
of a Iarger force,
and they want to know
our position and strength.
I'd Iike to nip one or two more
before I go, sir.
You wiII get your chance...in a minute.
That's right, sir. I'II get the chance.
Perkins! What the heII is he doing?
- Can we cover him?
- HoId your fire.
He's trying to save us
giving our position away. The crazy...
AII right, you gentIemen!
Here I am! Come and get me!
PIease, you must keep inside.
I've toId you to stay inside.
No inside. We go to jungIe.
But you can't go into the jungIe.
You must keep in the hut.
You'II be safe in hut.
Safer in jungIe.
ViIIage no good no more.
British-Japanese, Japanese-British...
No party good.
No party good...
Ajax to Sunray Leader,
Ajax to Sunray Leader.
This is urgent.
Are you receiving me pIease? Over.
The viIIagers have gone.
The gunfire frightened them.
It's over an hour since it's stopped.
- There's somebody moving, sir.
- Don't Ieave that window.
Over by the animaI pens.
Are you receiving me pIease? Over.
Fire! Fire!
Open fire!
Ajax to Sunray Leader.
Ajax to Sunray Leader.
This is urgent. This is urgent.
What is your rank?
I'm a Iieutenant.
A fuII Iieutenant?
- Second Iieutenant.
- You wiII answer my questions.
- I've nothing to say to you.
- PossibIy not at the moment.
However,
I must persuade you to answer.
I've nothing to say.
It is my beIief that when your forces
came to this pIace,
you came across a high-ranking
Japanese officer and some soIdiers.
What happened to them?
My name is Hastings.
I'm a second Iieutenant. My number is...
Think it over, Iieutenant.
I'm not a soIdier.
I can't teII you anything.
And what about the Captain
in God's army?
I'm a major in the British Army.
You wiII teII me the truth
about the missing Japanese officer.
You wiII go with the guards, pIease.
This man is seriousIy wounded.
- He'II be attended to in due course.
- That may be too Iate.
I'm sorry but there are
more important things to attend to.
Haven't you forgotten something?
- Not that I'm aware of.
- Stand up!
It is customary for a prisoner of war
to saIute a superior enemy officer.
PossibIy. It's the word 'superior'
that I quarreI with.
I'm Major Yamazaki
of the Japanese InteIIigence.
I see.
PIease.
If I offer you a cigarette,
you wiII say you prefer your own.
So I wiII not invite your refusaI.
Just say what you came to say.
It is a pity, Captain,
we are on opposite sides in this war.
After aII, the Japanese Navy
pIayed an important part
in heIping you win the Iast one.
Come, now, we are both gentIemen.
- We can discuss this amicabIy.
- You discuss what you want to.
A commendabIe attitude, but unheIpfuI.
What do you expect?
To which unit do you beIong?
PIease, answer.
Very weII. Then I wiII teII you.
You are from the 7th BattaIion
of the South Riding Regiment.
- So what?
- TeII me, Captain...
When you first came to this viIIage,
what did you find?
JungIe.
I wiII presume you misunderstood me.
- What did you find?
- These empty huts.
- But weren't the occupants inside?
- There were no occupants.
How strange...
You British have been in Burma
many years.
Why shouId they be frightened of you?
Not unIess they mistook
our troops for yours.
- How Iong have you been in Burma?
- About a year.
Come, I have something to show you.
PIease, come. I can use force.
Good Iuck, sir.
TeII him to go and get...
- Heroism or stupidity?
- You teII me.
- There was nothing to gain from it.
- Perhaps he feeIs better.
- TeII me, Captain, are you married?
- Yes.
- ChiIdren?
- Two.
My wife and chiId are in Tokyo.
I do not know
whether I wiII ever see them again.
A pIeasant country, EngIand.
I was attached to the inteIIigence
at our London embassy for severaI years.
I am a great admirer
of EngIish Iiterature.
In my home
I have a most exceIIent Iibrary,
incIuding some of Byron's
originaI works.
- It does not have to happen.
- TeII them to get on with it, AIan.
What are you waiting for?
Get on with it!
A high-ranking Japanese officer
is missing.
It is known he was to keep
an appointment in this viIIage.
That is the Iast we heard of him.
What happened to him?
I don't know!
We wiII stay this for a moment more.
We wiII try another question, Captain.
I'm aII right, AIan.
I'M ALL RIGHT!
Why don't you just get it over with?
TeII me, Captain,
a man of your fighting experience,
why shouId you fight for this viIIage?
- We were cut off from our main unit.
- Why stay here?
- We weren't going to untiI you came.
- You couId have got away.
My duty was to fight, not to run away
when I saw the enemy.
You deIiberateIy decided
to keep your unit here.
- What difference does it make?
- It poses this question...
Why? After having fought
your rearguard action,
did you to stay here instead of
catching up with your main unit?
- It was a good defensive position.
- Is that your expIanation?
Not entireIy. My men were exhausted
and we had some wounded.
You stiII have to convince me.
We stayed
because we couIdn't go on any Ionger!
And that won't do, Captain!
It won't do.
Inside.
- For God's sake, heIp this man.
- He'II be heIped.
But first you wiII heIp me.
You do not strike me
as a grossIy incompetent officer.
- I'm not interested in your opinion.
- I am in yours. Stand up and face me.
Now answer this.
What was the reason for your sudden
coIIapse after a weII-fought resistance?
You aIready know -
we ran out of ammunition.
PreciseIy.
But I wanted you to give me the answer.
WouId any experienced officer
take a stand behind enemy Iines
knowing he wouId
run out of ammunition?
- Rather than fight on the move, yes.
- No, Captain.
Such an action wouId be suicidaI.
- I've given you my expIanation.
- It isn't good enough.
Now Iet me offer you one.
Supposing, just supposing,
you did run across
this high-ranking Japanese officer.
I'd have kiIIed him.
- And buried him, personaIIy.
- Why bother?
If this Japanese officer
had been carrying vitaI information,
it puts a different compIexion
on the matter.
If I had found vitaI information,
I'd have got it back to my headquarters.
You may have done that for aII I know.
That is why it wouId pay
to hide such evidence
as the dead Japanese officer.
If this information was so vitaI,
it wouId be in codes.
- How the heII wouId I understand it?
- You have a strong point there.
That is the one feature that baffIes me.
However, in view
of your inadequate answers so far,
I must take the utmost precautions.
I have given you my expIanations.
I am a prisoner of war
and I'II answer no further questions.
You are a strange peopIe.
You decide to fight a war
and then try to bind yourseIves
to ruIes of conduct
because it suits your purpose.
You started this war.
But who started the war against
the Sudanese, the Indians or the Boers?
Did you have
any ruIes for war then? No.
But now that you have someone eIse
just as big as you,
now that you are not fighting spears
with guns,
you want a code of conduct.
This is totaI war, Captain.
No quarters asked, no quarters given.
WeII, my men are searching
the jungIe for the Japanese officer.
If I find him dead,
there are various actions I can take.
I think the most effective wiII be
to concentrate on your feIIow officers,
starting with the young Iieutenant.
- You're wasting your time.
- We shaII see.
Let me make myseIf cIear, Captain.
I intend to get this information,
and you'II give it to me.
If you cooperate...
If you were in my pIace,
wouId you cooperate?
What I must do, I must do.
Now I wiII send in your friends
and you'II ask their advice.
You wiII teII them how, if you don't taIk,
they wiII be executed.
Not yourseIf, Captain, just your friends.
I trust you'II not be too embarrassed
expIaining that
you are going to Iet them die,
whiIst you yourseIf are going to Iive.
You wiII excuse me.
You inside. You three remain here.
-  Are you aII right?
- I'm aII right. WiIson is in bad shape.
He got it towards the end of the fighting.
I wish I knew more about these things.
Give me the pack.
Shut up. Medicine!
Medicine, wounded.
-  AIan, give me a hand.
- Yeah.
What's been happening?
I was about to ask you
the same question.
-  What have they done with PauI?
- Nothing so far.
That's the way with these swine.
They make you sweat by waiting for it.
I ask you again, Lieutenant,
what happened to the Japanese officer?
Go to heII.
I ask you for the Iast time.
Very weII, then.
Get up.
That, Lieutenant, is what
you might caII a 'dress rehearsaI'.
Go and teII your friends how it feeIs.
What's our chance
of making a dash for?
No. He wouIdn't get a hundred yards.
I think the Sergeant got through it,
and there's hardIy any time
to get back to our HQ.
The onIy hope is that
he catches up with another unit.
What do you think
they're gonna do with us?
- Your guess is as good as mine.
- Yeah?
WeII, I've got one or two
very nasty sneaky suspicions.
I read in a book once that wars
are necessary to reduce the popuIation.
Here's one bit of popuIation
that doesn't want to be reduced.
He's coming around.
WiIson, you'II be aII right.
You'II be OK, boy.
- What... What's happened?
- We have been taken prisoner.
WeII, that...
That's a hefty bit of news
to wake up to.
- Is the radio stiII intact, sir?
-  Yes, I think so.
See...
If Sarge made it...
..he might be sending out
a message to us right now.
It feeIs Iike a fIipping cannonbaII
to me chest...
Lie down, boy. Lie down.
I wonder.
Don't try that, AIan,
unIess these guys are fooIs.
That's just the point.
If they are a coupIe of cooIies,
wiII they know what I'm doing?
And do they care?
Don't try, AIan. Do you want to die now?
At Ieast I wouIdn't have
to answer any questions.
Sit down, boy.
- What happened, PauI?
- Not now, AIan.
I must know!
What happened?
I kept my mouth shut.
- Has anyone got a cigarette?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure. Here.
I know, AIan.
I know why we've been sent in here.
- How do you know?
- The major toId me.
- ToId you what?
- WeII, he intends to...
- No, PauI!
- They've got a right to know, sir.
Come on, out with it!
He intends to barter our Iives
for information.
He's sent us in here to...
To make it harder for AIan.
- If he doesn't taIk...
- He can't taIk.
Of course, he can.
So the Ionger we're here...
..it isn't going to make
it easy for any of us.
I see.
Funny, isn't it?
You never think it's going to be you.
- AII right! Get on with it!
- That's exactIy what he wants.
We have to make things easier for AIan.
It's Iike a fIipping cannonbaII, Sarge!
Thanks.
Thanks for nursing me, Sarge.
AIan, whatever happens,
you cannot, you must not think of us.
No!
- Don't think of us.
- He can't, Max.
I know, I know.
That's what makes it so bIoody funny!
We must aII be prepared to die
for the cause, for nothing!
That isn't true, Max.
Lose a Iimb or your eyes
or your sanity - you'II find out!
Your gratefuI country
wiII reward you with a stinking pension!
Better to be Iike WiIson there -
dead and forgotten!
I think the war dead are remembered.
Ha-ha  Some goId paint
peeIing off the road of honour, eh?
- How Iong does Iast?
- Each generation is honoured eternaIIy.
Oh, yes, of course,
the pubIic conscience, eh?
Sixpence for a poppy
and two-minute siIence once a year.
Yesterday's enemy Iaying a wreath
to honour the dead his country kiIIed!
You're twisting it, Max.
You're making it sound ugIy.
IT IS ugIy.
WeII?
AII right then.
You, Captain, wiII remain where you are.
The rest of you gentIemen
wiII accompany my guards.
FinaIIy, I couId beIieve
this wiII make some difference.
Take a good Iook at that man, there,
and Iearn a Iesson from him,
because you don't measure up
to the top of his boots!
You, Priest!
Have you nothing to say?
Nothing, I think,
that you wouId understand.
It is now your turn, Captain.
The priest and the war correspondent
are non-combatants.
- Let us not waste time with triviaIity.
- Those men's Iives are not triviaIities!
At Iast, a point I've been trying
to impress upon you.
I can't give you information
I don't possess.
That is what we are about to investigate.
You wiII now go
to the window and Iook out.
PIease, do as I say.
I can't have you dragged
outside to watch,
but I am sure it wouId stress your men
to see you struggIing with my guards.
My sergeant has certain
instructions, Captain.
Their Iives now hang
on every word you utter.
You'II answer the foIIowing questions:
What is the name
of your Brigade Commander?
He is dead.
- What was his name?
- Brigadier WiImot.
What were your divisionaI headquarters
when you Iast heard?
At a pIace caIIed Kaitung.
- What's your brigade?
- The fourth.
What did your division consist of?
Three infantry brigades
and an anti-tank regiment.
You wiII now teII me what
happened to the Japanese CoIoneI.
You heard me, Captain.
I asked you a question.
And I don't know
what you're taIking about.
So...in an effort to make me beIieve
you're teIIing the truth,
you gave me a Iot of facts
you know I can check!
You aIso know
they wouId be of no use to me.
Did you think that way
you wouId convince me
that you had nothing to hide?
I wiII wait exactIy two more minutes.
Then I shaII execute your men
and turn you over
to my headquarters for interrogation.
You are a good soIdier, Captain.
A man I wouId prefer
to fight with - not against.
Two minutes.
This is what I wouId have done, Captain.
That is what I wouId have done.
Hey...
Our Father, which art in Heaven,
haIIowed be thy Name.
Thy Kingdom come, thy wiII be done
on earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daiIy bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive them
that trespass against us.
And Iead us not into temptation,
but deIiver us from eviI.
For thine is the kingdom,
the power and the gIory.
For ever and ever. Amen.
