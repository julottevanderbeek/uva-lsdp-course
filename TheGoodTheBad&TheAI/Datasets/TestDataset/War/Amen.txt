We thus have the occasion
to discuss questions
of international width,
in this year 1936.
Guards!
My name is Stephan Lux.
I am Jewish.
The Jews are persecuted in Germany
and the world lets make...
I see only one means
to touch the heart of the men.
Soon, we will have England!
Go ahead.
Truth!
It will be necessary to return, lieutenant Gerstein.
We fight typhus
by eliminating the parasites
and by purifying water.
You put clothing,
covers, cloths
in a place hermetically closed.
By the external openings,
you introduce crystals
of hydrocyanic acid.
Here the formula.
Does one have to manufacture them ourselves?
Not, the Institute will provide them.
All the details are here.
It is a dangerous product.
Proportionings etc should be respected.
As for water...
that intended for the troops
must be treated.
And if water is drinkable, Dr. Gerstein?
It will be it still more
after treatment.
What is drinkable for Slavic
is not it inevitably
for a human being.
You sit.
We must fight typhus
like our enemies, on all fronts.
Continue.
Let us continue our talk.
It conceived this program?
It is in Wehrmacht?
One has it to them piqué
thanks to his/her father who is a friend.
THE FÜHRER ORDERS,
WE OBEY
Father! I return from Vienna,
I had your message.
What did it occur?
God recalled to him small Bertha.
It is all that it remains of it.
What did it occur?
It was sick?
The letter known as: "Cooling,
then pulmonary abscess ".
Why did they anything say us?
"why"
do not make return deaths,
especially in times of war.
It is my niece, I could
to have drugs at the Institute.
My friends at the Institute praise your work
and say that you eliminate typhus.
I serve my country of my better.
An idealist like you
its place in the S.S has.
even if your wife disapproves.
Excuse us...
Pose the flower.
- do not do that.
- Why?
And your uniform?
Deaths are not accompanied
in behaviour of work.
Kurt is upset.
Bertha was his/her preferred niece.
It remains how long?
I would like the knowledge.
And you?
Say to him.
One speaks...
thousands of case through the country.
One of my parishioners received two ballot boxes
for his/her handicapped sister
and two official letters.
One speaks about heart failure,
the other of pneumonia.
It is a plan of the S.S.!
Not to kill out of the children...
The S.S. deal with all.
Pasteur, I disinfect the barracks
and I purify water.
It is not contrary
neither with my conscience nor with my faith.
If you discover something,
warn us.
I have nothing to do with all that.
Like Christians,
we condemn the euthanasy.
- What will you make?
- To protest.
Who will protest?
Christian authorities
must react.
You allow?
What do they still want?
Pasteur told me an atrocious thing.
Does that astonish you?
It is a passeist.
To propagate rumours in times of war,
it is high treason.
That that means it,
Monseigneur von Galen?
You did not take action pursuant
with my registered letter,
I deposit felt sorry for against X
for the assassination
"unproductive citizens".
We have the facts, the names
patients, their families
and their addresses.
If you do not take action pursuant,
Catholic I' Eglise
will have to inform its faithful.
Dad returned!
Heil!
- a gift of France.
- It is what?
Open, you will see well.
How are we?
It gigote.
I believe that one will have
another lieutenant.
What is there?
We have very difficult
problem of arithmetic.
I see...
Hello, Mrs. Hinze.
Not, initially your duties.
Read the statement.
If you do not have the solution,
read again it still and still.
"Knowing that a house
cost 15000 marks
"for a family of workmen
"and that one needs 6 million marks
"to build and manage
a lunatic asylum,
"how much can one build
working residences
for the price of an asylum?"
They are considered
like not-values,
like a broken machine,
a crippled horse,
or a cow
who does not give any more milk.
If you set up in theory
right
to remove its next unproductive...
Von Galen knows it
how much were eliminated?
Several thousands.
One day,
you will be,
we all will be unproductive.
What will become our soldiers then
with the return of the war,
seriously wounded, mutilated,
invalids...
unproductive?
These monks do not know anything
with the economy nor with the eugenism.
Ni with the compassion.
I would give a lesson well
in this von Galen after the victory.
Why not now?
God decides,
we carry out.
Enter, Gerstein!
Our specialist in purification.
Rest, lieutenant.
Tea, coffee, cognac, cakes?
Not, thank you.
You leave to inspect
our units of disinfection.
To the return, you will pass to Poland
to control the use
of the 500 cans of hydrocyanic acid
that we dispatch to them.
We build an industrial complex...
giant. They need
a specialist in chemistry.
Wehrmacht
has excellent specialists.
Wehrmacht is occupied
to gain the war,
we, we prepare
post-war period.
Not a long time ago
that you are ours.
You will see that the S.S.
like to remain between them.
This human heat
exaltée by our Reichsführer Himmler.
Thank you to have come.
I leave on mission.
One gained! They moved back.
The euthanasy campaign is suspended.
You are sure?
- Definitively?
- By fear of the public opinion.
The army of Jesus
the army of the evil overcame.
Warn Dibelius!
- You go where?
- A is!
You see this dirty water?
And that can be worse!
Go ahead!
If the pump is broken down,
there is the manual pump.
If you do not have any,
take buckets.
If not,
use your helmets.
No the helmet, that becomes serious!
But impossible to happen
this travelling filter.
And here!
You want to taste?
And you?
Health!
That refreshes, that does not make sick,
but it is disgusting!
A jumper of lady would be said!
You had the cross or the jumper,
with the combat?
A combat with the body with body,
I imagine!
I had both
in an engagement of night.
One needs more courage
for the cross or the jumper?
I was afraid in both cases...
but for the jumper, alas,
no bloodshed!
You went there à.fond each time!
Obviously!
As à.fond as I could.
Kurt Gerstein, of the Institute of hygiene.
You have 500 cans of hydrocyanic acid
in a not-protected place.
Only 500?
Vermin pullulates
between Berlin and Moscow.
With a can,
I disinfect a barracks.
If you are bombarded,
any life will disappear here...
They never bombard here.
They leave us quiet.
What do you hope to make some?
- It is what?
- Astispumante. Italian.
To conquer half of the world
to drink this wee of cat!
I raise this filth to Kurt Gerstein
who joint with us.
First visit of one of our camps?
Not, of course!
This one is special.
How much?
It is rather horrible...
Not even ten alive beings
saw what you have just seen.
Let pass to me!
You did not reserve,
captain?
All is complete.
You are sick?
You are sick?
Even a S.S. can be sick!
I am sorry.
The ambassador of Sweden
is also in the corridor.
The whole world is in the trains.
I am only the embassy attaché.
Baron von Otter.
Can you grant to me
a maintenance tomorrow in Berlin?
I must speak to you.
Why not here?
We have all the night.
I saw something...
of appalling.
Of absolutely appalling.
Whole families are exterminated.
Prisoners of war?
Jews.
One exterminates them by whole families.
They are stripped,
one mows the head to them...
even women.
They are mowed?
But why?
Draw the curtains, please!
Lit train,
assured enemy bombardment.
Hold, invoices of Zyklon B.
To eliminate the parasites.
I in provided them.
And they use it for...
My papers.
Not need.
Your government must prevent
Americans and English.
That they release leaflets
on Germany.
Once informed,
the Germans will raise themselves.
It is necessary to act quickly.
Each day which passes...
A few minutes of stop.
Remain in your places.
A short stop,
one lets pass a priority train.
If you want references on me,
ask Otto Dibelius,
superintendent of the Protestant Church.
You sit.
Prevent them from following me!
They miss you.
They see you whether little.
Better is worth than you are unaware of
what I will say to Pasteur.
I discovered a horrible thing.
Jews...
- Not here.
- It is unimaginable!
Later...
They are not expelled
like we thought but exterminated.
- What?
- Exterminated!
Enter.
I return from the camps of Poland.
They exterminate the Jews.
Most robust
are sent to the forced labour.
Women and children...
are gazés.
I saw it my eyes.
The Church must alert the Christians!
The first thing to be made
is to leave the S.S.!
I saw what should not be it.
A witness is needed.
I will be the eyes of God
in this hell.
That can be terrible
for you and your family.
One must denounce the assassins!
I will testify with the service to today.
We can start.
We arrive.
Undoubtedly, it is necessary to react,
but in a reflected, responsible way.
The Dibelius superintendent
can advise you.
It celebrated your marriage, not?
Leave the S.S.
Remain far from all that!
We said...
you said that the Jews are
a foreign body that one must expel,
that one can discriminate them
but not to persecute them.
Let us admit the massive executions.
- What do you suggest?
- To protest!
Protest which will be taken again
by the propaganda of the enemy.
Us will be shown treason.
We are in war.
The Church reacted
against the extermination of handicapped...
Euthanasy, not extermination.
The public clamour
the euthanasy stopped.
Let us protest for the Jews.
The handicapped people were
baptized members of our Church.
You are soldier,
far from daily realities.
Our people are bombarded,
in prey with cruel deprivations.
Majority of our faithful
and of our pastors
support Mr Hitler.
Nobody will protest,
nobody will believe you.
Führer and Himmler
also attended a test.
Order to accelerate the output.
The Institute sends to me in the east
to purify water...
I cannot take part in that.
That is not contradictory,
our installations are in the east.
Von Rotta, Hoess and yourself
had accepted the plans.
I speak about output.
I had announced the risk
of thermal distortion which...
Brought into service on March 22,
a convoy of 3000 units,
Ies furnaces burst by overheating!
- You drew on the costs.
- labour is free!
Use the model of countryside.
It should unceasingly be clogged
and the tar is rationed.
Lieutenant Gerstein,
expert in destruction of vermin...
in any kind.
One needs you.
I am not qualified
for this type of operation.
According to its superiors,
Gerstein excels
where it is not qualified.
Not so sure...
Here a new generation
installations...
who can treat 10000 units per day.
But...
it is impossible!
It will be needed.
In Europe, it is necessary to eliminate
Führer wants to finish some before 1948.
We will devote 1949
with the rest of the world.
The Fifty will be sabbatical.
The problem, it is that...
during the operation,
the crystals evaporate partially.
Evaporation begins again
after clearing of the places.
That slows down cleaning.
The crystals do not evaporate
that in contact with the air.
And while falling,
do the bodies choke the crystals?
It is that.
Sometimes, crystals exposed to the air
evaporate into 40 to 50 mn
instead of 5 to 10.
That slows down rate
and any estimate prevents.
Two factors can play:
The bad quality of the product
or a low temperature.
The number will raise the temperature.
Famous human heat...
Latticed conduits
the crystals will protect.
You will provide crystals
of quality in great quantity.
- My work at the Institute...
- We will divide you with them.
You will fill your duty of S.S.
and of Christian:
you will reduce to five minutes
anguish of the units
and you will accelerate rates.
- Lieutenant...
- Professor would be righter.
How long is necessary it
before intervening without mask?
- the filters are too expensive.
- Two hours.
Two hours!
Without ventilation, it is a minimum.
Which ventilation?
Which cubage?
With a pulsor of air of 1 CV,
you will gain one hour.
We will put two of them.
Turn over to your work
of cleansing
without forgetting your mission
Christian woman of public utility.
- the Nuncio does not receive!
- 5 mn! It is very significant.
Its Eminence does not see anybody.
Announce to me!
Excellence,
it is necessary that I speak to you.
- I must speak to you.
- What do you make here?
Lt Kurt Gerstein, Excellence.
I have information for the Vatican.
Its gravity justifies my intrusion.
I am shocked by your intrusion!
I call the police force.
If my superiors learn my visit...
It is an effraction, Mister.
I have a message for the Vatican.
I arrive from Poland,
camps of Auschwitz and Belzec.
Thousands of Jews are gazés.
Enough!
Leave from here! Come, Count,
we cannot listen to that!
I saw all of my own eyes,
Excellence...
convoys of all Europe
arrive in these factories of death.
Only the Vatican
can stop these atrocities.
Only the Pope, while alerting
the world opinion and Christians...
Thank you to trouble you
action of Its Holiness!
Catholic Etes you?
Excellence...
what I saw
haunt me day and night.
Even in death
the families are recognized.
They remain intertwined
ones with the others.
Naked mothers
tighten their baby on the chest.
One said to me
that after death,
one is not able to separate them,
even with hooks.
I then to contact the German army.
Renew it.
Leave us.
A provocation of Gestapo.
A S.S. which defends the Jews!
They take to us for idiots.
Is Mr. the baron von Otter there?
Not, I am his assistant.
Who are you?
Kurt Gerstein. It knows me.
It travels.
I can help you?
- It returns when?
- One does not know.
Elfriede!
Kurt!
Do not do that.
Stop!
I said to you to stop!
I said to you to remain there!
What does it occur?
You cannot remain any more here.
They bombard everywhere.
It is not that.
Goes in Tübingen, with the children.
Let finish them the school year.
I said not, it is not!
You are right undoubtedly.
Adelheid, takes along your brother to play.
If you explained me...
It is necessary to leave
As soon as possible.
I can nothing say moreover.
There is another woman?
You make me laugh...
You make me laugh.
At least, I am still used for that.
Who will deal with you?
Mrs. Hinze will make the deal.
It is Jewish?
It said it to you?
Someone else?
T'en do not make.
You take too much in heart.
Do not forget that you have a family.
It is what counts...
more than all in the world.
Mrs. Hinze,
prepare my business.
I will call the carpenter.
The bombs still shook it.
You lead us to Tübingen?
My father will take you along.
I do not have time.
Y has a large black car!
I am relieved to find you.
An atrocious thing arrived.
What a beautiful German family!
You do not know?
The plane of Führer
exploded on takeoff.
And was Führer inside?
With Goebbels, Göring and Himmler.
And did nobody survive?
If.
Germany!
I had you! I had you!
I will denounce you to hawk
false good news.
The stage of my father.
The bombardments damaged it.
The house of my friend
was puffed up.
Only the wall with the portrait
of Führer is intact.
The portrait of Führer
is always intact.
You are right.
You impressed
our colleagues specialists in...
If, impressed.
I leave...
for Theresienstadt.
I take you along.
Then you will see your manufacturer
of Czech hydrocyanic acid.
On the way, we will chatter.
You are only
with which that is worth still the sorrow...
to chatter.
Why only?
Our colleagues
have an intelligence technician
but it is is the boasting ones,
maybe of the drunkards,
maybe of degenerated.
Often, three at the same time.
Your children
make natural science?
They are too young.
I have a splendid specimen
of cranium judéo-Bolshevik.
A cranium?
There is no age to be informed.
I will show them.
For the anniversary of Darwin,
pure Swiss chocolate...
One did not have...
To give pleasure is my pleasure.
Let us see...
The man goes down from the monkey,
but the Negro and the Jew
stopped with middle height.
Delicious!
Not thank you.
Stop.
Control better
your facial muscles.
In the S.S. as with the poker,
combined and adversaries
do not have to read your thoughts
or your play.
You read my thoughts?
As an opened book,
this is why I appreciate you.
What a treasure you have there!
Take great care.
At the day after tomorrow morning.
I delighted in advance!
I am Riccardo Fontana.
We saw ourselves with nonciature.
I am Jesuit.
Jesuit...
Must I present to you thus
if this man returns?
That of the black car?
Present to me like...
a "Spy of God",
according to Kierkegaard.
Spy of God...
or of the Vatican?
Of The Vatican
would hardly be plausible.
- What do you want?
- I was ashamed of the attitude of the Nuncio.
You upset me.
Known as-me moreover it.
More?
On what?
If what you say is true,
the Holy Father must be informed.
But it will ask me evidence.
The Pope is unaware of
what do we make the Jews?
With its priests,
its parishes, its bishops,
it has the best service
of information in the world.
It is informed
persecutions of catholics.
That it thus gets information
fate of the Jews and Gypsies.
Gypsies
move much.
And one moves much the Jews!
The Pope does not wonder
where do the deportees go?
Nor the Pope,
nor my father, who is close for him,
do not have of regard for Mr. Hitler.
But they see that it succeeded
what nobody had dared:
to overcome Communism
in Germany and Russia.
And this man whom we do not estimate...
became a myth.
Your myth
makes acts of cruelty
that only the Pope, vicar of Christ,
can denounce,
so that the world
and the Germans know.
Dice that the Holy Father
will know these atrocities,
he will react with firmness.
But it is necessary all to say to me.
That will not be enough to convince it.
You sit.
People who betray their country
are always suspect.
Biscuits for Monseigneur.
It is very annoyed that you
you are gone away without preventing.
Monseigneur confers
with the minister of religion.
He wants that I introduce you
constantly.
It counts on your talents of speaker.
It has negotiators Nazis
very difficult.
- Why this meeting?
- Always similar.
To level the small divergences
between Reich and us.
Small divergences?
They refuse to pay the tax
intended for the Church.
I introduce you?
Already of return?
- I seek my father.
- How is Mr. Hitler charming it?
He greets you.
Your father is not here.
He will be there when?
Kurt, Führer was mistaken
about the Jews.
Still one of your jokes?
He presented them
as very dangerous
because very organized
on the international, exact level?
However, we note
that it is easy to reduce them in smoke.
Even our lunatics
were defended better.
Our Churches...
I am...
a little catholic.
Our Churches saved our insane.
Nobody moves for the Jews.
American Jews
are powerful, says one.
But Roosevelt is keep silent.
If Führer were mistaken,
like you say,
why continue?
It was mistaken in diagnosis,
no the remedy.
One must get rid of them.
But I believe
that we are lost.
Forgiveness?
This idiot turns in round.
Straight!
I awoke it.
Reich needs
men like us.
Men who know
to subject their conscience,
like these rough décervelées
who feel higher
because one them known as Aryan.
It is splendid! Splendid!
A Raphaël truth!
The press is interested in your father!
The Pope dedicated the world
in the immaculate heart of the Virgin Mary
to restore peace.
It is a significant celebration.
And I must present it.
Still a celebration...
You have the tended air.
Does the Nuncio send to you on mission?
I came from my own initiative.
Of your own initiative!
The Jews are exterminated
countries occupied by Germany.
We will finish tomorrow.
Leave us.
Leave us!
I came to inform the Holy Father of it.
It does not need you
to get information.
If it were it,
it would have banished these atrocities.
Change tone!
Its Eminence, the cardinal...
Make enter it.
- It can see you here?
- Yes.
Of my garden.
Thank you. They are ravissantes.
Riccardo, my boy,
you are superb!
- How is abominable Mr. Hitler?
- Always abominable.
And our American friend?
I await it, Eminence.
The Nuncio did not announce your arrival.
I came without...
It would seem that the German army
that is to say blocked in Stalingrad.
I have secret information
on the death camps.
Thus hold,
we have a secret agent there
who leaves his station
without warning the Nuncio.
The Holy Father must be informed.
The Holy Father does not have as a Mr. Hitler
that a quite poor regard.
Since it signed this infamous pact
with this Stalin,
nothing coming from him
will not surprise it.
I had warned the Holy Father
that it was about a trick.
It attacked too late
and it is found blocked
by the Russian winter.
The Holy Father is worried.
Hitler must crush Stalin
and to sign peace with the Americans
so that all these horrors,
who break the heart of the Holy Father,
cease.
Allies
will not sign with Hitler.
While waiting, one kills the Jews.
The Holy Father must protest.
"It must"?
The Jews are gazés
tous.les.jours.
We are accustomed
with the moanings of the Jews.
I hold this information
of an officer S.S.
Does count, your son attend a S.S.?
This is divine Providence
who sends this S.S. to you?
The American Mister arrived.
Welcome.
Count...
My Riccardo son,
it arrives from Berlin.
We crossed
this morning, not?
The Pope
did not receive me.
He received Germans.
But I met
many Eminences.
Your Eminence!
Here the answer
that your government waits.
Perfect, that goes...
It was a holy woman.
You did not know it,
Mr. Tittman?
The Fontana countess
us left too early.
You drink something?
We train a good team.
It's a pity that you do not remain,
Prague has a splendid Jewish cemetery.
Dear Luigi...
Monseigneur,
this has just arrived.
The Pope claims me.
The duty before the pleasure...
When returns the Taylor ambassador?
Not before two months.
We will be happy to re-examine it.
Count,
Berlin is not any more
a pleasant place, but...
it is a good school
to learn
moderation and patience.
We wish that Riccardo
y turns over as fast as possible.
Berlin is a punishment
or a promotion?
What thinks your government
massacres of Jews?
We test
to check these rumours
at the Vatican, precisely.
And the Vatican,
having had wind of the same rumours,
us asks to check them.
While you check,
If you want to be believed,
avoid these figures.
Known as a few hundreds.
I know somebody
who saw functioning the gas chambers.
Our host came to lunch.
Forgiveness, father.
You have finally your answer.
It is not signed.
The adviser of the Pope
you gave it in person.
It is a signature.
"Our congratulations
with lieutenant S.S. Kurt Gerstein
"for its nomination with the head
of our medical and technical service.
We thank it
for the excellence of its work."
Signed Heinrich Himmler.
For my part,
I name you
the worst enemy of vermin
whatever it is, where that it is,
and I join my congratulations
with those of Himmler.
Thank you.
An ambulance awaits your inspection.
It is urgent.
Continue, one returns.
On the other face...
you were right.
But the doctor and others
are content with you.
There are escapes!
Close the doors, there are escapes!
Masks! All!
It is very toxic!
Do not look at me like a calf!
Put your mask!
Bury the loading!
I do not feel anything.
One said to me to remove
irritating markers.
The escapes are difficult to detect.
Your mask!
Leave the car!
Bury the loading!
I do not want any more a this product here.
You clear up!
You know everyone.
- In permission?
- Not, in convalescence.
A good small Bordeaux wine.
I said to them
that there is a plan S.S.
of extermination of the Jews.
I saw it functioning.
In the name of the fights
Protestant youths,
I joined together you
to discuss the actions...
Good evening, father.
You know everyone,
Armin was wounded in the East.
- Nothing low register?
- I set out again soon.
Such an amount of better.
I can speak to you?
Why did you anything say me?
You do not believe me concerned?
thanks to my friends in the S.S.
I know all.
All on all?
All on you!
Congratulations for your promotion!
I would have preferred
to learn by you.
What you with this Pasteur make
and these troublemakers?
Father...
Your friends S.S.
the monstrosities said to you
what do they hide with the Germans?
Do not start again.
Our country was raised
thanks to the Hitler chancellor.
And thanks to the people,
less sophisticated than Thomas Mann
or this humanistic Pasteur.
They make us accessory to a crime
who will damnera Germany forever!
Do not listen to English propaganda.
Where are your knowledge
and Jewish ex-colleagues?
They are isolated public life.
In times of war,
one draws aside those which are claimed
of International
directed by Moscow then by New York.
And if I said to you
what don't they exist any more?
What does it have says exactly?
That thousands of Jews
were off-set and gazés.
He was the witness.
The Jews left for America
for a long time!
They are the Jews of Europe.
Obeyed the orders!
The S.S. are degenerated,
but exceeds them to him.
One sends them to work, of course!
Which employment requires
million workmen?
Do not work
for the safety of your heart,
but for safety
of our people!
It is what I do, father!
Harms and day.
Once and for all,
cease these sentimental sillinesses.
You lie. The Germans are unable
such atrocities.
Helmut, I t'en request!
Our fights against the Nazis,
it is past.
You are in the S.S.
and me in Luftwaffe
and our children are bombarded.
Afflicted.
And you?
I swore never not to raise the arm,
never not to say Heil.
Up to now, I succeeded.
"Happy that which forgets
what cannot be changed."
The Bat, Johann Strauss.
Forgiveness, Pasteur, I have work.
It still remains
many Jews with gazer!
Mercy, the Holy Father,
for the people of Christ.
Mercy for the Jewish people.
I know the sufferings of the world,
Riccardo.
My heart bleeds for the victims.
I request for them
and for you also, my child.
The world waits
that the vicar of Christ decides.
You were given in spectacle.
Somebody was to speak to him.
Its Holiness will employ words of fire
against the crimes Nazis
at the time of sound homélie of Christmas.
Why did you anything say me?
I say it now to you.
God is rented!
As well as the diplomacy
and perseverance.
Trust me.
The crematory ones are overflowed.
Why you do not have them
checked front?
This stock is ventilated and unusable.
It should be buried.
Contrary to the other deliveries,
your gas always poses problem.
The doctor wants not gas irritating.
All that is unusable.
It should be buried.
I cannot stop.
I will use it.
- That will not go!
- Even badly, it goes.
It détroussait the corpses,
and it bavassait.
I cannot work any more
without drinking.
What did he say?
Corpses howl
once in the furnaces.
Slip by!
Your Zyklon spends 60 minutes to be operated
instead of 10.
That slows down rates.
That irritates us.
All the robbers.
Berlin congratulates us for our results
and asks us to increase our efforts,
but a catastrophe
be likely to block our mission.
Problems of transport?
Our convoys have priority.
It is about the provisioning
in Zyklon of quality.
Treblinka is in out-of-stock condition!
If we do not use
what only one point of storage?
Too much risky!
Our camps were never bombarded.
The Convention of Geneva prohibits it.
Can one rationalize
this problem of provisioning?
The forecasts are established
for 10000 units per day.
I receive 6000 units per day!
Me too!
I cannot treat them
nor to place them.
I receive from them 7 to 8000 per day.
A true chaos.
There are some who make the war
from their offices!
And one asks us to accelerate!
Give us the means!
Ask the co. Schriever
grinding stones to crush them.
One will never leave oneself there!
I have nightmares of them!
Silence!
A little order, please.
- You evaluate your needs with how much?
- I do not evaluate.
I want enormous stocks of Zyklon
in only one place, underground.
Spend an even little money.
The suppliers will have evil to follow.
They shout Heil Hitler
and fill the pockets.
That they are wary.
One can aryaniser the aryanisateurs!
Gerhard will be your intermediary.
It can make there.
It is well introduced in Switzerland
and in the neutral countries.
I do not want only any fair
of gas or installations.
They are your estimates?
Then?
Caution!
I awaited you.
I am wary of the telephone.
The Allies must act.
The situation worsens.
It is necessary to bombard
the ways which lead to the camps
and places of extermination.
I informed my government.
Insist! The machine of death
go day and night!
You over-estimate
capacity of the heads of State.
We negotiate
with the United States since 7 months
so that they accept
in the ocean.
It arrives from there ten times more per day.
For your family...
A friend will inform the Pope.
I am sure that it will react.
The Allies must be ready
to inform the German people.
I will let it know.
I can obtain passports to you...
I will not leave my country.
I must testify.
A French dinner
for German Christmas!
I will have a farm in Normandy
with horses.
After our victory.
I found a farm in Poland.
Not in Poland,
my wife and me let us hate the cold.
I will have an island in Greece.
And your dream, Kurt?
I want to be a German in Germany
to testify on what I saw.
Alas, you will not be able all to say.
Excuse me.
A German in Germany!
You are there! It is well.
You receive, I can set out again...
Remain! You must translate.
- It will start.
- Mrs. Hinze, the radio!
I return.
It was the promised surprise?
Not, it arrives.
There will be precise rules
to respect.
The Germans comply with the rules,
if they are precise.
No gifts before...
to sing!
- did That start?
- It is imminent.
I will get rid of them.
Now, the surprise.
I have a small play
for your Christmas presents.
When I whistle,
you enter there, I extinguish the lights
and I close the door.
You will have one minute
for hunting for the treasure.
With the second whistle,
you will stop Net.
All that you will have taken
will be with you.
With your marks,
loans...
You can amuse the idiots.
Why so many efforts
to like?
I am very attached to the traditions.
- Which gripped me the buttocks?
- Christmas present!
Interdict to collect!
Our friends like your small gifts.
I will telephone my family.
Excuse me.
"Family",
a so soft word of our language.
Present to them my wishes.
Do not let anybody enter.
It calls the people
to bring back the divine law
in the centre of gravity of the company.
"This wish,
"humanity owes it
"with the infinite number
"mothers who suffer,
"of the widows and the orphans
"which was seen ravir
"the light,
the support of their life... "
"This wish,
"humanity owes it
with innumerable exiled
that the hurricane of the war
tore off with their fatherland... "
- What to make?
- Known as that I speak to my children.
Put music,
that they dance.
Mrs. Hinze... smile.
I will test.
It speaks to his children.
"... of non-combatant
"to which the air war
"that we have
"denounced many times,
"the men have...
"without distinction removed
"life,
"health,
"houses,
Ies asylums of charity
and of the prayer."
It is all?
It is all.
It did not pronounce the words "Jew"
or "concentration camp".
You can leave Germany?
The Pope is protected too much.
He must hear a witness.
The Holy Father arrives.
Washington is astonished
homélie of Christmas of the Pope.
Not to condemn the atrocities Nazis
the authority of the Pope weakens
and confidence in the Church.
One cannot condemn Hitler
without condemning Stalin,
who is your ally.
You cannot compare them.
Greetings and good wishes
that President Roosevelt
us sent to the occasion
Holy season of Christmas
were for us
source of rejoicing.
Our heart is saddened with the thought
that the light which emanates from Bethlehem
illuminate a world
ensanglanté by the war.
Nobody appreciates better
that President Roosevelt
Ies constant efforts of Your Holiness
to prevent the war
and to limit its contagion.
Your Holiness knows
ceaseless efforts of Pdt Roosevelt
for the victory.
A total victory.
Your moral assistance
in this effort
will be highly appreciated
by the President.
You have this time
the agreement of your superiors?
One refuses nothing with your sons,
protected from the Pope.
The Holy Father loves you.
Yesterday, he said to me
that Berlin will be a great experiment
diplomatic for you.
Diplomacy and Gospel
do they go together?
In Christmas, one waited
its words of fire
against the crimes Nazis.
One needs evidence to the Pope for...
I have an eyewitness
loan to come to testify.
An officer S.S.
I have friends to lunch.
If you hold your language, you are welcome.
Thank you, I will eat in my room.
I wanted to present to you
with the American ambassador.
Then, I come with pleasure.
Arnulf! What a big boy!
I have something for you!
- It is what?
- Look at.
I visited a factory not far.
I made a turning to see you.
Does that go?
Better than yesterday and less although tomorrow.
- Hello, Pasteur.
- Hello, Kurt.
Small gifts of Ukraine.
Forgiveness,
but there are rumours...
on Russia.
It is said that a marshal of Reich
capitulated
with its men
in a place named Stalingrad.
You listen to the English radio?
Me? God keeps me! Not!
It is a rumour...
Propaganda,
tall stories, defeatism.
Thank you, Kurt.
You remove me a great weight.
Goodbye, Pasteur.
We collect what Hitler sowed.
I cannot remain a long time.
Go...
enter all!
This war destroyed our values...
and the Church is the victim.
We had a warlike Pope,
he died.
Providence gave us
a Pope of peace,
and the war burst!
How are you?
Sit down.
Here the American ambassador.
My son arrives from Berlin.
Which news of Berlin?
This, Your Eminence.
A S.S. gave me
this chart of Poland.
It is the names and necessary
concentration camps.
In red, the number of gazés perjury.
In black, estimates:
What can we make?
To negotiate to save them.
To negotiate with the Nazis?
Never we will negotiate
with these criminals.
To even save
a million lives?
Only our victory will save them.
They will be reduced in front ashes.
If the Holy Father interceded
near the Nazis for the Jews...
Out of question!
The Holy Father must remain neutral
in order to act for peace.
And there will not act to remain neutral.
It could intervene in the name of Christ...
Germans
would occupy the Vatican then
and would plunder it.
The Vatican should be saved
or Christianity?
If by miracle it saved them,
your government
would it accomodate these Jews?
Why Hitler would it accept?
To carry a fatal blow
with the democracies which would accomodate them.
Goebbels said: "That those which like
the Jews take them, but naked ".
That would create an internal agitation,
and a gigantic wave of anti-semitism.
Your desire
to save these unfortunate
fact of you an agent of Goebbels.
Since its rout with Stalingrad,
Hitler counts on our weaknesses.
To save Jews
our effort of war would slow down,
what would arrange it.
While we lunch,
trains run towards the camps.
And our children die in the combat
to save the free world.
The world is sick...
Riccardo, my small,
I' Eglise is made of patience,
of patience, faith
and of hard labour.
With the end, time
always give reason to the Church.
Always.
One should celebrate Easter
at the same date, each year.
There are two great dates
for the Christians:
the festival of the Blessed Virgin,
August 15,
and Christmas,
December 25.
Easter does not have fixed date.
The Christians need reference mark,
if not they are lost,
they are mislaid...
Even the contrition
can be pride.
I feel guilty like witness
and even more as priest.
By pride and obstinacy,
you trowels your future.
As long as I testify
love of Christ
for the men, all the men,
my future is assured.
Hitler can destroy us,
us, men of God
and all Christians of Europe.
If all Christians of Europe
became Jewish for a time,
the time of persecutions,
what would make the torturers?
Reality is that there is
on a side Nazis,
other, Communists.
The Americans are still far.
If my friend from Berlin came to Rome,
would you meet it?
If you think...
that it of it is worthy, yes.
If you it judges worthy,
can you try to obtain to him
an audience with the Holy Father?
Yes.
Thank you.
There is what is
and what should be.
Alas,
we must live with...
what is.
That made an eternity!
Bring to drinking.
It did without the things from there
since our campfires!
Sit down.
What can I for you?
Can you organize me
a voyage to Rome?
- For you and your family?
- Me only.
An outward journey and return?
You want to leave when?
I do not have the date.
What do you think of the situation?
I think that we were right,
the continuation will confirm it.
God thank you, my myopia
led me in this sinister place.
Here, I can serve my fatherland
without disavowing my convictions
nor to betray my faith.
Where did you land?
With disinfection.
Vast program.
I make you a priority master key.
You will travel when you want.
I do it with your name?
Of course, thank you.
In these heroic times,
you obtained a title
or a rank?
Lieutenant of Waffen S.S.
Address yourself to transport of the S.S.
It is a private voyage.
Thank you for your visit.
You must send
more and more of trains in the East,
goods trains.
Do you know what you transport?
Goods.
Men too.
Labour.
Industry develops much
in the East.
Put your photograph...
in S.S., it will go better.
And if I said to you
that families there are piled up
to lead them to the slaughter-house?
Leave from here,
if not I call the police force or Gestapo.
I did not change, Karl.
Me either.
These trains carry out us in hell.
I do not deal with freight.
- You am the rotation of the trains?
- I help my country to gain the war.
And if these trains were slowed down?
Will you leave from here?
Or you prefer
what do I call the police force?
Make leave it!
You can join to me
at the Institute of Hygiene.
That Christ
take care on you and hold them.
Bastard of S.S.
I must set out again tomorrow evening.
It is short, but I think
that my father will obtain the audience.
I learned that 400 S.S.
arrived to Rome,
a special unit.
The Allies approach Naples.
More than 3 million were gazés.
Three million?
Here are them...
Ies delivery orders of gas Zyklon.
On these charts
all the camps appear.
It is what it is necessary
to convince them.
There is a stopping.
What is it?
Saturdays, they are sure
to find them on their premises.
One can nothing make.
- What does it occur?
- Count, can you lodge us?
Lead them to the house of friends. Go!
- They are in your street.
- I know.
The Holy Father rose very early
this morning.
It awaits you.
- Principessa!
- the Germans stop the Jews!
Here even, with the corner of the street.
Not, my sister, it should be found.
Please...
Say to me...
What?
Why your father
is it so close to the Pope?
We are auxiliaries
papal throne.
Thank you, my sister.
My father is with the Pope.
We learned
that they also stop converted.
Convene the Weizsacker ambassador.
We require explanations.
Make starts to him from Our anger
and of Our sorrow.
Not...
Of Our sorrow and Our anger.
Mgr Hudal!
Is eminence, my father here?
The Count is with the Main thing.
Gerstein, a friend.
- It one is converted?
- Forgiveness?
That does not change anything,
but we separate the two sensitivities.
Not, Kurt is Aryan.
We must see my father.
It discusses provisioning
with the Main thing.
We have 56 refugees:
requiring medical care.
I will send a doctor,
flour...
Meat and pastes are hard to find.
There is many refugees.
- Your son is there with a friend.
- Really?
- Kurt Gerstein.
- Delighted by you meet, Count.
- You obtained the audience?
- Forgiveness...
In the current situation,
it is unthinkable
that the Pope meets a German,
especially an officer S.S.
And the Cardinal?
- Go ahead. I prevent it.
- You accompany us?
I must make sure that the convents
accomodate these unhappy.
By here.
Wait there,
an authorization is needed.
It is out of question...
that a S.S...
who betrays his country
enter here.
Certain treasons
are the last weapon of right.
We all love you.
The Pope, your father
and myself
let us include/understand the distress of your heart
but it overpowers us
and the life poisons us.
Put yourself there,
you will replace my secretary.
You will take notes...
and you will include/understand
how the diplomacy functions.
The Vatican
has the largest masterpieces.
And no division to defend them.
Mr. I' Ambassadeur,
I would be grateful to you to order
that one ceases immediately
these arrests in Rome.
Twenty days ago,
the commander S.S. Kapler,
required 50 kilos of gold
not to off-set the Jews.
The Jewish community gave to him
and now, they are stopped!
Must one think that your government
does not respect its word?
Alas...
I wait until you say to me:
"Why you do not resign?"
It is painful for the Holy Father,
beyond what one can imagine,
that in Rome, under its eyes,
one makes suffer so much from people
because they are of another race.
What would make the Holy See
if that continued?
The Holy Father would not like
to have to express its disapproval.
This is an official request
of the Holy Father?
It wishes not to have to do one of them.
Until now,
it did not say anything but the Germans
can take as a hostile act.
But there are limits.
If the Holy Father were
in the need for protesting,
it would go back from there
with Divine Providence.
One says to me
that one also stops converted!
Protest, Monseigneur.
Protest.
- What do you make in Rome?
- Rolf Grober, what a surprised!
You came to disinfect the Vatican?
I seek a means
to return to Berlin.
Who is in load of transport?
Lieutenant Nitzel.
I will present to you.
There is an insane world!
Still not enough.
Italian is kosher fascists.
Without them, we would have the double of it!
They only think of flying.
- I present to you in Nitzel.
- What will you make them?
Why one is there?
One is converted since two generations.
Good return in Berlin.
A thousand leaves tomorrow evening
by the station of Tibertina.
Tiburtina. Trastevere.
Nothing any more will stop them.
There is still a means.
What must we know
on Cassino Goes up?
The Americans bombard without respite.
The Germans always hold.
Part of the monastery is destroyed,
especially the southern wing.
The library...
It is surely destroyed.
They also bombarded the vault.
Mr. Weizsäcker said to me that the Germans
will never leave Monte Cassino.
We solicited
the American representative
to make cease
bombardments but...
there is little hope.
We received the gifts
of the Spelmann Cardinal
and of the company of the Jesuits.
The Holy Father...
if your Holiness does not act.
We consider your zeal with love.
Who defends persecuted
speak in Our Office.
But, in fact,
only moderation
can make us honor.
But they will be off-set this night!
If the Holy Father shows himself at the station,
as in San Lorenzo
after the American bombardments,
The train will not leave.
Mister the Secretary,
I' Eglise opened its convents
and its monasteries with oppressed.
Many Jews
are under our protection.
The German ambassador
ensured me that the others
are led to a camp of work.
- With women and children?
- You want to separate the families?
Are off-set they to kill them!
It is up to the Christians
and of the Vatican to save them...
Leave from here, how you dare!
Count, make conceal it.
Very the Holy Father,
with all the respect
had with those which impose silence to Us,
I beseech Your Holiness
to act personally.
In Germany,
in Austria,
many are the Christians
who have hope only in Us.
Can we overpower them
with a new burden
whereas they undergo
terrible bombardments?
At the proper time,
we will intercede
in order to restore an equitable peace
who will link all the Christians.
Our prayers,
our cries of pain...
Withdraw that!
You do not know what you do!
It is a blasphemy!
On the dress of a servant of Christ!
Forgiveness, father...
I request Your Holiness
to raise me of my functions.
Who would know better than Us
is what it to be Père?
It is a crown of spines.
The baby died.
The priest!
A priest among the Jews?
What?
- Coffee or schnapps, captain?
- both.
Isn't the doctor descended?
It is too early for him.
What?
They took on board a priest
with the Jews.
It says being secretary
of the Nuncio in Berlin.
- Which did that?
- idiots, to undoubtedly have fun.
I fear that it is
a spy of the Vatican.
To convert the Jews
during the voyage?
To see what one does here.
What did it see?
Here nothing, but it made the voyage.
Four days.
In its coach,
there were 8 died including 5 children.
What of other?
It is said that it is the cousin of the Pope.
It denies.
It is here by error.
Fritsche, they all are to it!
If he is a secretary of the Nuncio,
it should be released.
It is sure that it is not Jewish.
I issue that it is Jewish.
You, over there!
Your Holiness...
Approach.
It is said to me that you are not Jewish?
I am like the different ones.
One needs volunteers
and priests
if somebody dies.
Work is hard,
it is our Ruhr news.
Factories of death,
this odor...
Pharmaceutical factories.
That feels the nitrogen, the gum...
I know what it is.
It came espionner!
You want to be crucifié?
I have another project.
You will learn the tolerance.
Your Church, formerly,
purified by roughing-hew it.
The Nazism makes in the same way
on a large scale.
In a direction,
we are the new elected people.
Amen!
I am a little catholic myself.
Not as excessively pious person as him...
Fritsche,
you fall into the sentimentality.
Leave us.
And send to me a kapo
for our canon.
It is very believing.
It does not like that one speaks religion here.
But it is a good soldier.
In six months or a year,
we will lose the war.
It will be our turn
to enter the catacombs.
Find-me of comfortable in Rome
and I leave you...
from where nobody never left.
You will hang your testimony
with the bells of Saint-Pierre.
You are pitiful.
The world knows already.
I know, but note it
that divine anger
do not thunder in the sky,
nor allied bombers.
They crush our cities,
but here, the sky is serene and empty.
The sky is never empty.
Put it at Probing Kommando.
It my is protected.
Do not touch one of its hair,
nor its star
nor a wire of its cassock.
You will work with the crematory ones.
If God is some share here,
you will find it.
Goes...
I need a car.
One needs a priority order,
my lieutenant.
Hold.
Immediately.
Afflicted, my Lt.
There is a priority convoy.
Construction will be finished
in December 45.
The production will start into 46.
- I fear that...
- What?
The labour which arrives
is of worse into worse.
Does all go from worse into worse, not?
Startup in 1946,
yes or not?
Yes, of course.
Enter!
I must speak to you into private.
It is necessary to make quickly.
Fritsche wanted to release it
dice its arrival here.
To joke,
the doctor put at Probing Kommando.
It has all considering.
The Nuncio requires explanations.
Himmler is afraid of the consequences.
Is Himmler... afraid?
This priest will go to Berlin.
Never in Rome, all is envisaged.
Fritsche, you occupy in.
One will make him sign
that it saw only floors of flowers.
Wait the canteen.
Known as In Berlin
that I do not have nothing to do there.
It will be there in five minutes.
What of other?
Known as In Berlin
that I do not have nothing to do there.
Do not make any you.
Corporal, lay out.
My God...
Your father was sure
that you were in this train.
I take you along.
God leaves his children...
to be made devour.
I want to include/understand...
why.
Why sacrifice you?
You are wrong...
You are wrong.
It is necessary to go to say to the world
what occurs here.
I cannot leave.
Gerstein!
The world knows all.
Look at,
it does not have any more the air of a priest!
Put it with those which he likes so much!
It is a diplomat of the Vatican,
it is here by error.
Me also, I am here by error.
It is the martial court...
Falsification of an order of Himmler.
You were in Rome
pleurnicher for your safety.
And me which trusted you...
By the chimney!
It will go more quickly to the sky.
I spoke in Himmler, on the telephone.
It wants to make disappear
all traces of the mass graves.
Do not make not astonished.
Tomorrow, it will ask
to dismount the showers and the furnaces.
It tries to exchange
Hungarian Jews
but it does not find taking.
The priest found you
good contacts in Rome?
Yes.
If you want to benefit from it,
it is needed alive.
Too much late.
I will only manage.
The most glorious page
German history
will never be written.
Did Rome remain a pleasant city?
I will not leave my country.
They will hang to us, Kurt.
You before me.
Your name is on the invoices
of Zyklon.
Return on your premise,
at the Institute, where you will want...
One does not need more your competences.
Your God will have problems
with you, Gerstein.
What does it occur?
Pasteur, I am in a hurry.
What will we make?
You returned!
I must set out again.
Dad is there!
You will know finally what I did,
what I know. I will be the witness...
You will not be listened to.
The S.S. are...
I have evidence,
figures, of the names.
I will go...
The Americans will include/understand.
The French are more meadows.
The Americans are far.
- You cannot cross the lines.
- the face is ploughed up.
Pasteur said to me that you were there.
What did it arrive to us, Kurt?
All that one does say is true?
All.
I knew it,
but will it be lends in time?
What?
The secret weapon.
Yes.
I knew it.
One will stop them.
Give your uniform, my son.
Father...
I leave on mission.
Wait there.
That it waits.
Gerstein did not finish.
The friend written Gerstein
the French version of his report/ratio.
Another version?
What do you think of him?
It says to have resisted
with the policy of the atrocities.
It resisted
while being inside up to that point!
I do not believe it guilty.
His report/ratio is a significant document.
Here is the bill of indictment against him.
"... that it was not
neither comprehensible nor excusable
"that a Christian convinced like him
"did not make
all that was in its capacity
to keep away
criminal system... "
One found the S.S. Gerstein
hung in its cell.
It was hung or it was hung?
I do not know.
I want a report/ratio written.
Mgr Hudal?
Your friends suggested me the United States.
They take only specialists
in chemistry, aviation, physics...
biology...
I am a doctor, simple doctor.
Then, it will be Argentina.
There is a boat in six days.
While waiting, I put to you over there.
The Report/ratio of Gerstein contributed
with the authentification of the Holocaust.
Kurt Gerstein was rehabilitated
