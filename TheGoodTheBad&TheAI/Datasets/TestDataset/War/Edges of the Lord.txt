I was 11 when I realized
how dangerous it was to be a Jew.
My father called me
to his study one day,
and said in order to survive,
we had to separate.
Papa then began to pound the
Catholic prayers into my head,
so that I would pretend
to be a Catholic,
assuring me
that God would understand.
But when he began
to put me in the closet,.,
my mother and father began
to argue,
And once I heard him cry,
Does the holy communion
really taste like blood and flesh?
Hail Marys,
Can't let go until you're finished.
Hail Mary, full of grace,
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus,
Holy Mary, mother of God,.
pray for us now
and at our deaths later.
No, that's not it.
You need to be strong.
I brought the potatoes.
I can't lift my arms.
Don't make me do it anymore.
Max!
Max, he's here. You told me
he was coming on Thursday.
He wants to take him right away.
What happened?
Professor, if you want me to take
the boy, it has to happen now.
Wait.
There's no time.
It has to be now. Yes?
But he's not ready.
He has nothing packed.
Professor, yes or no?
Do you have
the baptismal certificates?
Here.
A priest arranged them
for all three of you.
Romek!
Sarah, bring him here.
Mama, I don't want to go!
Go get him some clothes.
Quickly!
He's not going anywhere!
No!
Romek, you have to go now.
Please let me stay!
Let go! Mama!
Boy, get down.
Papa... Let me stay.
Romek, please.
Halt! Can't pass!
Papers.
What are you carrying?
Potatoes.
Jew! Stop him, he's a Jew!
It's him.
Let's go.
On your way. Fast.
Praise the Lord.
So... this is the boy.
Yes.
Father!
Oh no!
Father!
She's driving me crazy.
You must talk to her.
She's telling me again I stink.
Maybe it's time to jump
in the river.
But I can't swim.
Find a shallow spot.
As we approached the village,
Mr, Lipa said,
that the Germans
loved to kill and eat a lot
They took
from the Poles almost all,
the cows, goats,
and pigs,
Vladek! Open the gate!
Hello, neighbor!
You have a visitor.
Yes.
This is my wife's cousin's son.
They lost their house in a bombing.
He's going to stay with us
for a few months.
What nice, noble features.
He looks like a precious music box.
Vladek, faster!
I'm glad Mr. Lipa
was such a good lier,
He said: "You'repart
of my family from Cracow. "
His name is Romek.
Vladek, say Grace.
Bless... Bless us...
Bless us for these...
Bless us for...
Bless for...
Why don't you make him say it?
No. You say it.
Bless us, oh Lord, for these,
thy gifts, which we...
are about to receive from the bounty
through Christ our Lord.
Amen.
Vladek, I want you
to go to the quarry...
and wash the cart
for Sunday Mass.
Papa...
Can I show him the pig?
What?
Can I show him the pig?
After the meal.
Romek, come.
Listen, boy...
Don't tell anyone about this pig.
Anyone!
You understand?
It wasn't very smart
for Mr. Lipa to hide the pig,
and the Jew in the same house,
If the Germans find out
about the pig,
He's going to get us all killed.
It's just for a few months.
Vladek, not a word
of this to Tolo.
For hiding a pig from the Germans,
there was a penalty of death,
Go! Go!
No, Vladek! Stop it!
No, Vladek!
Stop it, Vladek!
Pyra, stop it!
My mother said that the world
was upside down,
Two plus two equaled seven,
Or even one hundred.
But never four,
Right answers were dangerous,
And so were the kids,
Especially Maria,
Vladek's girlfriend,
And Robaland Pyra.
Look! Vladek's cousin.
He's a spy. Get him!
He's too pretty.
Let's hang him.
Come on, you guys.
Hey, where is Romek?
Tolo?
In the pig house.
Why?
Vladek put him there.
Go and get him in here.
Now!
Get out!
Stop it!
You two better get along.
You understand? Answer me.
You sleep together tonight.
My brother knows
how to break noses, you know.
Vladek, show him!
If Papa hadn't stopped me,...
you would have gotten this.
You are dead.
Come sleep in my bed.
She's having her nightmare again.
Shut up.
She works so hard during the day...
and it all comes
back to her at night.
Tolo is so stupid.
On Sunday, I went to a church
for the first time in my life,
I was scared,
I knew all the other children
would be there,
Of course, when you really look...
at the group that Jesus
surrounded himself with,...
They were all human mongrels.
"Mongrels!"
We are all lucky to be alive.
Everybody here
who goes to the toilet...
every day for one minute
should be happy.
But...
can you smile
like this little child?
No.
All I ever hear from you are grunts,
groans and complaints.
But somehow, you survive
another day to fill your mouth...
with the food your wife
is feeding you.
How can you be so ungrateful?
How can you be so unkind to God?
Today I'm starting
catechism classes.
For all those lost souls,
who because of the war,...
haven't had
their first communion yet.
Vladek, Pyra,...
Maria, Romek...
And you too, Tolo.
I want you all at the first class.
This afternoon. After the Mass.
Be there, or you're dead.
What is the holy communion?
A wafer.
Tolo thinks it's a wafer.
Vladek, what do you think?
Romek?
It is the feast of the body
and blood of Christ.
Exactly.
Kick his ass.
Who has got a knife?
Pyra.
You little fools.
You think it's wine I'm drinking...
at the altar every Sunday
at Holy Communion?
No. It's the blood of Christ.
And it is not a wafer.
It's Christ's flesh.
Can I have my knife back?
Father!
The Germans came to Batylin's Field!
They're looking for pigs!
Father, he's going to kill me.
No!
Officer...
Please... take the pigs,
and forgive them.
Catch me these pigs.
What?
Catch me these pigs.
For every pig you catch,...
save one life.
Now you're a pig catcher.
I'll give you one minute
for each one.
Begin.
You still have one minute.
Come on.
Come on.
Why did Maria run away?
She saw her parents
being killed like that.
Now she acts weird sometimes.
Did you go to the trains?
None of your business.
Go to sleep.
What trains?
I can't tell you.
Why not?
Vladek told me not to.
The day after the killing in the
fields, I saw the priest in the barn.
I think he was arguing with God,
Hey, Tolo!
You ever see your cousin
before he came here?
No.
Why aren't you
with your parents, boy?
Our house was bombed
by the Germans a few weeks ago,...
and my parents...
Ah, yes.
My mother got hurt,...
and she is with other relatives
who are taking care of her.
You should be
with your family, boy.
One day, the priest
gave us a game to play.
I think that's where Tolo
began to get his strange ideas,
I want you to play a little game.
Vladek, take these sticks.
The names of the apostles
are written on them.
There are lots.
Take two apostles each.
Learn about them.
Become them.
And study this book.
It has pictures.
You almost caught those pigs,
Father.
What did you say?
You almost caught them.
We saw you.
You, get lost.
Jesus didn't play with girls.
Go to hell, Vladek.
I'm not going anywhere.
Vladek, there is a blank stick.
We can put Jesus in there.
The priest didn't say to do Jesus.
You can't have apostles
without Jesus.
Give me that blank Jesus stick!
Okay, fine.
The blank one is Jesus.
Fair enough?
Okay. Everybody draws
at the same time.
Close your eyes.
Here we go. No peeking.
Hey, give that back!
She got Judas! The traitor!
You can keep it.
But who got Jesus?
I did.
I should get it.
Hey, give me that.
No.
Fine. You have to hang
on the cross then.
Okay.
At night.
When it's cold and dark.
Okay.
But Vladek can't throw me
in the water,...
and he can't hit me anymore.
I'm Jesus.
Tolo asked me why Jesus wanted
to be crucifiied,
"To save all the people"
I told him.
I think he liked my answer.
Pound it hard.
No, I don't want to do it.
That hurts.
What are you doing?
I know what they're doing.
Playing Jesus games.
You know, you can do exercises
that will make it hurt less.
What exercises?
You can put your hand in a fire.
Or you can run naked in the rain.
Or you can make a crown
with a rose bush...
and wear it on your head.
Pyra! Come here!
Stop it! You're drunk!
You shut up.
I want to talk to my neighbor.
Praise the Lord!
Praise the Lord!
Neighbor...
You know we have to be
very careful.
Germans everywhere.
Batylin is finished!
I know.
You are the most beautiful woman
in this entire village.
I'm sorry, my wife.
You too are very beautiful.
But in a different way, I mean.
Lucky devil.
Beautiful wife, beautiful farm,...
beautiful cousin.
Is that what you came here for?
It's time to go home.
Gniecio,... You are not doing...
something stupid
that could get us all killed?
Or are you?
Okay. Let's go.
Father.
Vladek says that Jesus
didn't play with girls.
Is that true?
Are you still Vladek's girlfriend?
Did you ever... kiss him?
You must be without sin...
when you take
your first communion.
Pure.
Do you know
about Mary Magdalen?
No.
Read about her.
Professor Pyra!
Where was Jesus born?
In the Vatican.
Oh, so he was Italian?
Yes, father.
No. Jewish.
He was a Jew.
Jew?!
Quiet!
Get up!
I have an idea.
I will spend an hour
in the barn with my beloved.
When I come out, you will play
the villagers and stone me.
Ready?
No chance.
I wanted to scream for help,
But it was too late,
What are they doing?
They are lying naked
on top of each other.
That's awful.
Do you want to see me?
Can I see you?
No.
Why not?
Because.
Did she show it to you?
I've seen it twenty times already.
And what did you do to stop me
from going into the barn?
You coward.
I'm through with you.
Soldier,juden!
Soldier, jew!
Vladek, are you crazy? Stop it.
Let's go!
What did you say?
Jew.
Where is the Jew?
I'm a Jew.
You are?
Yes.
No, he's not. He's joking.
Hans! Hurry up. I'm melting.
Coming.
Hans, help me!
Wait for me!
Tolo, take off your hat.
Take that hat off.
Take that hat off!
Old witch.
What did you say?
Gniecio!
You haven't gotten a good spanking
in a long time.
I need it!
Gniecio! I think you better talk
to this boy!
Look what he's wearing
on his head.
Take the hat off.
Tolo, take the hat off.
Take it off.
Why are you doing this?
For a while, I set one stone
for each day that passed,
But time passed, and there were
more and more stones,
And no one came,
Tonight we are raising the pig.
Why?
It's getting too dangerous
to keep it.
Kluba will go with me.
Kluba's been snooping
around here for months.
He asked me to get rid of it.
He has found a buyer
in town.
Don't.
Come on, Romek.
All you have to do is push
on its belly with your hands.
Ready?
Now.
Harder.
Harder!
She's having
a big nightmare tonight.
Alright, back up!
I'll be back in the morning.
Mr. Lipa was like my father,
He would do anything for his family,
-Be careful.
-I will.
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
-Mama, please stop!
-No!
-Please stop!
-No!
I don't know what happened.
Gniecio left with the man
who bought the pig.
I waited for hours.
Then I went to look for him.
And some people told me
the Germans shot somebody.
I found him in a ditch
and I brought him here.
That's all I know.
What about the money?
I checked. He didn't have any.
Get up! Get up!
You stupid fool!
Get up!
-Praise the Lord!
-Praise the Lord!
Just watch Tolo.
He loves you so much.
Tolo comforted his mother,
but he never cried,
Then, on the night
of the funeral,
he did something very odd.
Tolo!
What are you doing?
-Tolo!
-Get off me!
Tolo! Are you insane?
Leave me alone!
I have to do my exercises!
-Tolo!
-No!
Get off of me!
Stop this game!
Tolo!
Romek, what's going on?
What did you do with him?
He was running in the rain.
Why did you let him?
I didn't.
-What?
-I went to get him.
-I told you to watch out for him.
-I did.
It was the only thing I asked you
to do in this house for me!
Get out!
-Get out!
-Mama, don't do it!
I said get out.
Romek, don't go!
Mama, stop him!
Oh, my baby, you are going
to get sick again.
What happened?
Did Vladek do something to you?
They threw me out.
Who's that?
Don't worry. She can hardly see.
Come here, boy.
Closer.
City boy.
Lie next to me.
You are so wet.
I felt safe with Maria.
Look at me.
I liked how she smelt like strawberrys,
It remindme of my mother,
Vladek is coming.
It's okay. I will talk to him.
What do you want?
I want to talk to Romek.
Romek isn't here.
Romek?
Tolo is very sick.
He wants you to come back.
He wants all the kids to come.
He asked especially for you.
Romek!
Mama, go away.
What?
Please, Mama.
Romek,...
I'm sorry.
I have a plan.
And all of you are in it.
On that special night...
What special night?
One night...
I'm going to hang on the tree.
All night.
And I am going...
to make them all come back.
Who?
Everyone.
Who, Tolo?
Papa.
And yours. And yours too, Romek.
And we all have to take...
a bath together...
Get baptized.
Get baptized together.
To get ready.
Say "yes", everybody.
Yes, Tolo.
Yes, Tolo.
Yes, Tolo.
I'm not putting my head in it.
You have to.
You promised Tolo.
Please stand on the side.
Please do it.
Thank you. Could you lean down?
I have to kiss you.
Oh, no!
Because you shiver,...
by this holy river,...
and you might get cold.
Listen to me. And remember...
that you all put your heads
in the bucket.
And now you have
to follow me.
I'm going to suffer for you.
But I'm going to make things better.
You did a good job.
Vladek, come here.
It's Robal.
They've been to the trains.
I knew to avoid Kluba.
But, how could I stay away
from his sons?
Well, well, well,...
Mr. Very Late Apostle.
I'm not playing these games anymore.
Robal says they're stupid.
Stupid!
What are you going to do?
Stop the war?!
You promised.
Make my tooth grow back.
Now!
Come up the ladder.
Close your eyes.
Evil demons
that stop tooth growth,...
go away!
Nothing!
He can't do shit.
Teeth should be easy.
You did that on purpose,
you little dwarf.
If you go, you can't come back.
I'm going.
You creepy traitor.
A bunch of kids and a girl...
And this sissy here, playing Jesus.
Pyra! Don't go!
I love you.
Stop! Right now.
Don't touch me.
You are not Jesus!
And you should be on those trains.
Romek! Head!
My nose!
Pyra!
Pyra!
Pyra, don't go!
My nose is broken!
I had to go for myself.
People were whispering that you use
for going in one direction only,
Did your father jump after you?
Yes.
Who's that?
Papa?
Is that you?
There's nobody there.
You went to the trains.
Were they jumping tonight?
Yes.
I told you. I really don't know
what happened.
Gniecio sold the pig
to the man. I saw him.
The man in town said Gniecio
never sold him the pig.
He's a liar.
He said another man
sold him the pig.
A man with a big mustache
like you.
What are you going to do?
Rat on me?
To who?
That boy across the road.
How much money
did you make on that?
Get out of here!
How long have you been there?
Kluba knows about me.
What's he going to do?
Probably nothing.
What's going to happen to me?
Don't worry about him. Come.
Let me show you something.
What are these?
Holy hosts.
-Do you want some?
-No.
Don't worry.
They aren't hosts yet.
They are just the edges.
I never bless the edges.
Are we blessed?
Or are we just the edges?
We are all scraps, Romek.
And we are all blessed the same.
But not all the people. Right?
For Batylin.
His wife.
Vladek's father.
Maria's parents.
I went to the trains last night.
My parents aren't coming back
for me, are they?
Probably not.
What will you do with me
if my parents don't come back?
They will come back.
What if they get a sickness?
Or die in the war?
You can stay here.
Take those nice shoes off.
Okay, you can look.
What are you doing?
Follow me.
Come on. All the way.
What now?
I promise I will love you always.
And I don't love Vladek.
I'm glad you came to our village.
And I'm glad they didn't hang you.
And I like your nose
and your hair and your skin.
Now, you promise.
Don't let go!
I promise I'll work hard
to buy you lots and lots of perfume.
And I'll always be your boyfriend.
I mean husband.
I always wanted
to marry a city boy.
My arms!
Tolo took the part of asking God
to bring our parents back,
very seriously,
I don'tknow
why we didn't stop him,
Harder.
I want to be alone.
Papa?
I'm hanging!
Hey, dwarf in the tree.
How did you get up there?
You are so skinny.
No food, huh?
What do you want?
Hey, Robal, how are the sheep?
Everybody knows.
What sheep?
Sheep are better than girls.
You better shut up.
Stop it, everybody!
Shut that little slut up.
Get out of here.
No, Vladek.
If you dwarfs weren't so busy...
playing games with each other,
you could make some money.
Piss on you!
You're so stupid.
Just like your father.
Let me go, you bastard!
Come on. Let's get out of here.
We're going home.
Vladek, what are you doing?
Don't touch it. Don't untie me.
Tolo, stop it. We're going home.
No! Don't untie me!
You promised!
You put your head in the bucket.
Mongrels.
Now Papa is never coming back.
You killed him, Vladek.
Zyta!
Leon! I'm here.
Where's Moshe?
I don't know. He jumped first.
Go find him.
Moshe...
Moshe...
Bring him.
Can you walk?
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Stop!
Where are you going?
What do they want?
You will tell your story
at the police station. Come on.
-We don't have any money.
-We have no money.
No money?
If he sees us here, he'll kill us.
Then what about gold or jewelry?
You have that?
Vladek, slow down.
Kluba...
Kluba killed your father.
What?
I over heard Kluba arguing
with the priest.
The priest went to town
and found out...
it was Kluba
who sold the pig.
Your mother's?
Somebody's mother's.
Hey, city boy.
What did you mean by what you said,
"somebody's mother"?
-Are you spying on me?
-Romek, let's go.
What do you know, Jew boy?
Robal, stop it, you idiot!
Shut up, you little whore!
Let's throw him in.
-No.
-Yeah.
Okay.
What are you doing, Robal?
Get lost!
Get lost!
Vladek!
Maria...
Romek!
Be careful, son. You have
your mother to take care of.
And Tolo. And Romek.
Your father would be proud
of you.
Let's go.
Are you coming?
Take your shoes off.
Put your head down.
Hey, Robal!
You're not going to shoot.
Stuff that in his mouth.
Shut him up.
We have no father.
Your father will have no son.
Vladek, no!
That was for you, Papa.
Vladek, give me the gun.
Hands up!
Romek, run!
Hands up!
Wait a minute!
The boy is robbing the Jews.
Pick it up later.
Come here.
How much money
did you make tonight?
Look at me.
Good job, Colonel.
Would you like
to go for a ride?
Come.
Franz!
Stop here.
I've got to show you something.
Just wait.
Come with me.
Listen...
When I say "go",...
you do the same thing you did
in the forest, all right?
Come with me.
I've never seen anything
like this in my life.
Look at this boy.
Romek!
Go!
Now watch.
Take the coat off.
Faster.
And the vest.
Good boy, huh?
Take your shoes off.
Take your shoes off!
Come here!
Faster!
Shut up!
I'm a Pole! I'm not a Jew!
Let me go!
See? He's going something there.
Beautiful.
Good boy!
-Shut up!
-Let me go! I'm not a Jew! I'm a Pole!
Hey, what's going on there?
I'm not a Jew! I'm a Pole!
-Bring him here.
-I know him.
-You know him?
-Yes. He's a Pole.
I'm not a Jew! I'm a Pole!
-How do you know him?
-He was helping me.
Where?
-In the forest.
-In the forest?
Let's see.
Pull down your pants.
Pull down your pants!
Come here.
I'm so sorry, Colonel.
I'm so sorry.
Keep up the good work.
And son, pull up your pants.
-Tolo!
-Catch him!
-What do you think you doing?
-I know him.
-That boy?
-Yes, Tolo.
That's my brother.
Come here.
Do you know that boy?
Do you know him?
That boy says he is your brother.
Is he?
Tolo!
Do you want to go with them?
So shut up!
That's my brother!
Tolo!
This is the lamb of God...
who washes away the sins
of the world.
Happy are those
who He calls to His supper.
Romek.
I will never forget Tolo,
nor the kindness
of those who helped me,
to remain who I am.
