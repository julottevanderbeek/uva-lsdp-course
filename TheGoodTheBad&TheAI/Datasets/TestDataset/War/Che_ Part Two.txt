In March of 1965 Che Guevara
announced to...
...his cadres at the Cuban Ministry
of Industry that he was off to...
...Camaguey to check on sugar cane
production. Within days Guevara...
...had vanished into thin air.
Speculation regarding his
whereabouts was rampant; even...
...his wife, Aleida, claimed not
to know where he was.
As the pressure to explain
the disappearance mounted,
Fidel Castro decided
to read, in public,
a letter from Che.
He who merits...
...through qualification and virtue,
the highest ranks...
...is, however, not counted...
...among the members
of our Central Committee.
And so...
...we can only explain it
by reading this letter...
...from the hand and word...
...of Comrade Ernesto Guevara.
A self-explanatory letter.
It says the following:
Fidel, at this moment
I remember many things:
When I met you
at Maria Antonia's house...
...all the tension
involved in the preparations.
One day they came by asking
who to notify in case of death...
...and the real possibility
of it struck us all.
...that in a real revoultion,
one either wins or dies.
I feel that I have
completed the part of my duty...
...that tied me to the
Cuban Revolution in its territory...
...to the comrades,
to your people who are now mine.
...my post as minister, my rank of
Comandante, and my Cuban citizenship.
Other nations of the world summon
my modest efforts of assistance.
I can do what is denied to you by
your responsibility as Cuba's leader...
...and the time
has come for us to part.
If my last hour
arrives beneath other skies...
...my last thought
will be for this people...
Let me see you without the hat.
You're the living portrait of your father.
You have the money?
Yes.
We could wait
until things settle down.
If we don't do it now we'll have
to wait another 50 years.
One more.
One, two...
...three.
Aleidita, remember Mom and Dad
sit at the head of the table.
But since Dad's not here,
we'll give his friend Ramon the seat.
Here it is. Four...
...and five.
What is he doing?
I don't know.
Go see what your brother is doing.
Go see what your brother is doing.
Special representative
from the "O.A.S"?
Yes, the Organization of American States.
Just a second, please.
There's a man who is
a special O.A.S. representative.
Organization of American States?
Yes, let him in.
-Please, come in.
-Thank you.
Mister,
may I help you with your suitcase?
No need.
I'm worried about Monje.
Why?
When I asked him about
the 20 men he promised...
...he said, "Which men?" as if I had
never talked to him.
It's okay.
Apolinar.
Serapio.
-How old are you, Serapio?
-Sixteen.
At sixteen,
a man already knows what he wants.
Hello. I'm Camba.
Ramon.
Do you know who that man is?
He came with you.
The man you just shook hands with...
...is Che Guevara.
-Are you sure?
-Yes.
Could I shake his hand again?
-Ramon.
-Ricardo.
-This is Coco, Inti's brother.
-I know, I know.
-The Farm is under his name.
Braulio.
-How are you doing, bro?
-How are you?
-Miguel!
-What's up?
-Urbano, how was the trip?
-Quite tough.
Rolando.
You're Inti?
-It's an honor to meet you.
-The honor is mine. I'm Ramon.
This is our doctor Ernesto Maymura.
He's in the Bolivian Communist Party
and studied medicine in Havana.
-Where did you do your residency?
-At Calixo Garcia.
And so we fell asleep.
Do you know where we woke up?
-In the United States.
-In New York.
We went right in with
our Panamanian passports.
Everything was going smoothly...
...until we almost screwed it up
because we were so hungry!
Braulio says, "Let's go
over there, they have hot dogs."
So we got there, and
of course, the vendor was Dominican.
The first thing he says is,
"Oh, but you're Cuban."
Braulio just looks at him.
He served us the hot dogs
without another word.
I made a mistake
and took the wrong flight.
You didn't make a mistake,
you discovered something.
What did we discover?
If you dress an elephant as a man,
it would still make it into Bolivia.
Good one.
To Bolivia or anywhere else!
Brother!
Let's go.
Hello.
-Eustaquio.
-Welcome, Eustauqio. I'm Ramon.
-Salustio.
-Ramon.
-I'm Pedro.
-Ramon.
Paco.
Aniceto.
Tuma, this is Aniceto.
Carlos.
Tuma.
-Willy.
I'm Chapaco.
I'll need a few days
to learn your names.
In the last conversation
I had with Monje...
...I made it clear that if we really
want to change this society...
...we are the ones
most capable of doing it.
That's why the party
has to support the guerilla.
Monje expressed his doubts about
the armed struggle.
He began to talk
about his love for his family.
And here people also have children
and women that they have left behind.
That is why,
with all due respect, Ramon...
...I don't think the party
will support an armed struggle...
...much less Mario Monje.
So I want to ask for permission
to go back to La Paz...
...and recruit
the best people from the party...
...to join the group.
First we have to meet Mario Monje...
...as we agreed to.
Not doing so would be inappropriate.
Conditions are not right for
the kind of struggle you propose.
Mario.
Anywhere in the world where men
are being exploited by men...
...conditions are right.
When children work in mines...
...and 50 percent of miners
don't reach 30 years of age.
When the same miners
go on strike...
...to improve their wages...
...and their are massacred by the army,
are those conditions right, or not?
If infant mortality rates...
...are the highest in Latin America...
...because of lack of hospitals
and medical care...
...the situation is right for me.
If we learned something in Cuba...
...it's that a popular uprising
that isn't backed by armed struggle...
...has no chance of taking power.
When people learn that
this movement is led by a foreigner...
...they will turn their backs on you.
You will die heroically...
...but you have no hope
of achieving victory.
Then let's change
the name of Bolivia.
After all, Simon Bolivar
was a Venezuelan, right?
Comrade Monje...
...your job and the party's job is to
make it clear to the people that Che...
...that Ramon, is a revolutionary
from the continent, not a foreigner.
It's true.
Ramon is like Simon Bolivar.
The party does not
endorse armed struggle.
You are free to abandon it.
And you will have
our support if you do.
If you stay, the party will no longer
pay your stipends.
As the head
of the Communist Party here...
...I advise you to leave with me.
With a mojito,
you cannot grind up the leaves.
-I know about mojitos...
-So you know you can't grind them up.
You cannot grind the leaves.
How are you?
Come over.
Just a second, I'm finishing here.
Then you have to cover it.
Half an hour in the oven
with the correct temperature.
No, I forgot something -
on top of the cream put cheese.
Cheese.
Excuse us for a second.
We need to talk.
Go ahead.
-Everything good?
-Yes, good.
Why did Che change
the location of the camp?
I think he wanted
to be closer to Argentina.
He had contacts
waiting for him in Alto Beni.
The mines are there.
Miners are more politicized.
They support us.
Che needed somewhere
to train for six months...
...where he wouldn't be bothered.
How is that Nanchahuazu region?
It's a very remote place.
Life is hard there.
In fact,
the few peasants who live there...
...don't trust foreigners.
The Soviets won't allow Monje
to make a deal.
No.
We have some money
that we want you to take to Bolivia.
And we need to find out if
there's anything else...
...that we need to send.
We also found a cave
which could be useful.
Good morning.
I told them that I'm going back
to La Paz today.
I'm resigning from the party.
My mission...
...is over.
-Okay.
-The jeep arrives this afternoon.
Why don't you stay in the camp
until the jeep arrives?
I would like to be alone.
I'll wait at the zinc house.
Fine.
I'll return on January 10th,
with my decision made.
Okay. Monje, we'll be here.
Coco, find Moises Guevara.
Tell him I want to talk to him.
We're leaving in a few days
on a training march...
...for about 20, 25 days.
I'll go to the mines.
I'll be back between the 4th and
I'd like to come back earlier,
but it's a Carnival season...
...La Diablada in Oruro.
My men will be all spread out,
it'll be difficult to gather them.
You are our primary
connection to the outside.
Your cover needs to remain intact.
You can't come back to the camp.
There may be a strike at Siglo XX.
And your husband?
How are things? Did you
get the trip straightened out?
I arranged everything so that
he could go study in Bulgaria.
What about Barrientos?
What happened there?
We've been in contact.
-What happened?
-I think he likes me.
I know he likes me.
-Should I try to see him again?
-Yes.
Tania, when this thing heats up...
...your job will make the difference.
Here are provisions -
sugar, eggs, flour - what's needed.
The new employee, is he Bolivian?
Yes.
-How much do I owe you?
-No, keep your money.
-No, keep it.
-We are neighbors now.
-Take it.
-I'm not doing this for the money.
I want to take part in your project.
I have relatives in transportation.
You can rely on me for everything.
Okay?
Go with Tuma to see our neighbor...
And tell him wee need his help.
Involve him without offering much.
Tell him that we'll pay
for what he carries in the jeep...
...and nothing else.
Tumaini.
Put a little fear in him.
And explain to him that if he
betrays us he'll pay with his life.
You can drive back and forth
to town in your jeep...
...so you can buy the food we need
and we'll pay you well.
Yes, sure, whatever you want.
-Good.
-I have to tell you something.
In private, because it's something
I would only say to a friend.
Okay, fine.
You want some more?
There were two
little birds who lived in a tree.
One was quiet, the other liked to
fluff his feathers, and sing and sing.
One day a hunter came by.
He heard him sing,
then put him in his sights and shot.
But the other bird, the quiet one,
nothing happened to him.
He saved his own life.
It's a nice story.
-It's good.
-It's good. I liked it.
I really liked it.
I know what you mean.
You junkie son of a bitch.
We'll see.
Good morning.
-How are you?
-Good morning.
This looks beautiful.
I see the factory is doing well.
-Good morning.
-Come with me.
Can we come in? Show me the house.
I see you are really busy.
Soon. I don't know when, but soon...
...we will confront the enemy.
Our contact
with the outside will be limited.
Some of us will die, and it's
sad to see your comrades die.
Because you can't help them
with your limited resources.
Food will be scarce.
Sometimes we won't have
anything to eat.
And if all of this weren't enough...
...we'll have to
endure the harsh weather.
By the end...
...we will have become human waste.
That's all I can promise you.
Think it over.
You still have time to go back home.
Afterwards it will be too late.
In closing...
...I would like to repeat...
...what I said to Monje.
Me? I'm already here.
They would have to kill me
to get me out of here.
I will be at the side
of those who stay, until victory.
How much corn can you
sell us right now?
There's not even enough for us, sir.
At least sell us a pig.
They're piglets, just little ones.
How am I going to sell them?
Besides, they belong to the missus.
How much is your pig, madam?
I can't sell them
they're only sucklings.
I'll pay you 30,000 bolivianos.
I'm not sure.
How about 40,000?
Should we sell or not?
Make it 50,000, okay?
Okay.
What conditions do they live in?
Very bad.
Do they have children?
They have six kids.
Barefoot, all full of ticks.
One of the little boys
has a badly infected eye.
How old is the peasant?
About 40, 50 years old.
I think he's a little older, you know?
And when you offered the money,
how did he react?
His eyes sparkled
when he saw the money.
Hello.
Good day, Honorato.
Come, I want to talk to you.
We want there
to be schools for your children...
...and hospitals to take care of them...
...and roads to be built...
...so trucks can reach here
and you can sell your products.
Don't you want all these things?
Well, yes, that would be nice.
But in order to do this,
we need your help.
Two...
...and three.
Look.
You are a big man.
May God repay you.
-It's all right.
-May God repay you.
Okay.
-See you.
-Bye, madam.
-Goodbye.
-May God repay you.
What are you doing?
That's communal food.
No one helps themselves without
being given permission to do so.
Understood?
I'll let you off this one time
because you don't know the rules yet.
-Everything belongs to the group.
-But we're hungry.
We're all hungry, Dario.
But one can feeds six for breakfast.
There's one missing.
I have no radio coverage
with the main camp so I'm going back.
No, big guy.
You're not going anywhere.
Stay with us until six, then you
can tell Ramon how far we've gone.
No, I'm going now
while it's still light out.
Hey, I'm giving you an order!
Stay here until six.
-I'm leaving now.
-You're not leaving, can't you hear?
You listen to me, I'm fucking going.
You'll have to
go through my machete first!
-Hey!
-What's wrong with you?
Hey, Miguel!
What's going on here?
Listen, listen!
Miguel, look at me!
Hey, you're comrades.
"Comrades" for what?
He has to follow orders!
That's enough!
Miguel, you have to control yourself...
...and give orders with respect...
...like a boss.
You cannot threaten
or hit anyone here.
That's not
permitted by the guerilla.
And you know that better than anyone.
And you...
...lied.
Miguel never hit you with the machete handle.
He didn't even touch you.
The one thing I won't tolerate here...
...is a liar!
One more incident like that, Pacho...
...and I'll send you back to Cuba
with a dishonorable discharge.
Incidents like this destroy group
morale and our readiness for combat...
...not only of you, or you...
...but of the entire group.
If anyone feels weak or discouraged...
...he shouldn't resort to such methods...
...but should speak to the political
comissaries, to Inti or Rolando...
...or to me...
...and we will peacefully discharge him
from the group.
I didn't come here to work.
We should have a rifle.
Listen to me.
Ramon could be back now
in Cuba with his family...
...with many cars, enjoying comfort
everywhere he goes.
But he is here because he
wants you to have a better life...
...so your kids
can learn to read and write.
I'm just a baker,
I've been a slave all my life...
...but some day I'll be free.
Rest because
we'll be leaving at sunrise.
-We're not staying here?
-No, we need to be patient.
We are taking you to another
camp where you'll be safer.
Have you had any problems?
There's a neighbor that thinks
we're making cocaine.
The police have
been here twice already.
When's the last time
you heard from Ramon?
Over a week ago.
We lost contact with the whole group.
Moises, hello!
Who did you bring?
Contacts from Argentina and France.
Chino is from Peru.
Are you going back to Camiri?
I need to talk to Ramon first.
Monje and the Party
are interfering with everything.
They even convinced the last
Bolivians that were trained in Cuba...
...not to come here and join us.
Hey, listen.
Hey.
Everyone keep away from her hammock.
Whoever touches her will
be severely punished.
Listen to me, Arturo.
They are Bolivian,
and they have come to fight.
You must not disrespect them.
I need two volunteers to go hunt
and I thought about you.
Bring something good
because supplies are running low.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
We'll get money for this.
Hey, that sounds like a plane.
Airplane!
Come on, Ramon.
Get down, Ramon.
They caught two of Moises' men
who deserted...
...and they talked like parrots.
Soldiers went into the zinc house.
They seized Tania's jeep and a mule.
-Who gave orders to move camp?
-Antonio did.
Tell him we'll win the war with bullets.
-Bring back all to the camp.
-Okay.
Rolando.
Prepare an ambush.
Was there anything in the jeep?
I had some
recordings of Fidel's speeches.
They're going to search the jeep
which will lead them to the hotel...
...and the hotel will lead
them to yor apartment...
...and your apartment will
lead them to everything.
I couldn't trust anyone.
Every time I called
they hung up the phone on me.
-That's why I decided to bring...
-You had strict orders not to return.
That's five years of lost work.
Tania, five!
Give me your rifle.
You and the visitors will leave
as soon as we prepare your trip.
Hold your fire!
We surrender! We surrender!
My superiors are cowards
and don't tell us anything.
I didn't want to be here. I swear.
Calm down.
-Please don't kill me, please.
-Calm down.
I suffer from rheumatism, I swear.
-Listen, no one is going to hurt you.
-And I have a bad heart.
Don't believe a word major Plata says.
He's a liar and he's abusive.
He sells our food to the stores
and keeps the money for himself.
He hits people.
Look how he's crying. He's a coward.
So what should we do with him?
Kill him.
Yes, kill him.
Put him on his side.
-Did you give him a painkiller?
-Not yet.
Give him some morphine.
We have commited
ourselves to a struggle...
...in which, whether we
like it or not, we may have to kill...
...or be killed because we are
fighting for Bolivia's freedom.
You can do it now.
I won't be returning.
I'm quitting the army.
We hope to see you soon.
Because we could use more
of your ammunitions and weapons.
Long live a free Bolivia!
Long live
the National Liberation Army!
No one wanted to stay.
That takes time.
No, if you leave now
you could be arrested.
I think you should wait
until we start our march northward.
-You're going north?
-Yes.
Then we can't let you off
on the Cochabamba road.
No. I don't think that's right.
That could take two or three months.
Ciro, we're at war.
Give me a guide.
Give me a guide and I'll
make the arrangements.
I can't break up the group
under these circumstances.
I'll think about an alternative.
But every move we make will be made
with the group as a whole.
Ramon, your books are soaked.
Put them on
those rocks to dry.
Arturo.
Water got in the radio,
everything is rusted.
What are you saying,
that it doesn't work?
It still recieves,
but it doesn't send.
Shit. Now we're really screwed.
Not quite. We still have
the visitors to relay messages.
The army says that you are
here to practice Communism.
That you have no God,
that you all work for the State.
That you rape women and
destroy families.
You kill those who refuse to serve you
and wait to make us slaves.
And what kind of freedom do you have?
The kind where
I can do whatever I want.
Listen to me.
None of what they said is true.
We haven't come to harm anybody.
We just want to buy
some food from you, that's all.
But I have nothing, only this.
How much do you want for this?
Whatever you have - take it.
I'll stay if you need me.
What I need now are peasants.
It's better if you go to France and
make a network to promote our cause...
...so they can send us money, medicine and radios.
I'd also need you to take
some messages to Cuba.
I'll write Sartre and Bortrand Russell
to organize a worldwide fund...
...on behalf
of the Bolivian revolution.
Don't worry.
We'll take you out
of here when you recover.
I'm not worried.
Tumaini.
Here, it's yours.
To protect you.
I'll move southward with the vanguard
and take the visitors out by Muyupampa.
I want you to stay
with the sick until we come back.
How long will you be gone?
About three days.
Rolando.
Go with Loro to replace
Benigno and Miguel.
Ramon.
There's no one in the house.
So leave the money with a note.
Pack up everything, we're leaving.
Ramon.
There's no sign of Loro.
That's what they've given me, Captain.
What good is this for?
Are there any shops here?
They took my pigs and my corn.
You helped them
and they gave you money.
Now you are going
to help us eliminate them, otherwise...
And now you are stealing
my chickens, Captain.
Listen to me closely,
smart ass, really pay attention.
Let me know immediately
if the guerillas come back again.
You have a good heart.
You'll do it.
Good morning.
I'm just here to write an article on the
guerilla movement in Bolivia.
Trying to confirm
the Bolivian army's rumors...
...that Che Guevara
is the leader of the group...
...and there is a woman with him.
This guy is a Trojan horse.
I don't want
any Cubans talking to him.
-What's up, Dario?
-Food is ready.
Start serving. Children first.
Are you from Paraguay?
Paraguay? No way, I'm from Oruro.
Okay, kids.
Once you are done you
have to leave, right?
We can't leave because that
gringo owes us money.
How much does he owe you?
I spoke with the Englishman
about the way out.
He says the army knows him in Camiri.
We could get out that way.
You are the ones
to make that decision.
We could use our papers
to pass as reporters, no problem.
Inti will take you
up the road to Camiri.
Try not to go through Muyupampa.
Don't get yourselves captured.
If that happens remember to
always deny my presence...
...and the presence of all Cubans
here at each moment and at all costs.
-Do you have a cigarette?
-No, I don't.
Goddamn it!
Why don't you smoke?
Smoking's great.
But I do have some tobacco.
Thanks, brother.
