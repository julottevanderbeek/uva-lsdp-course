8
Moscow Vnukovo Airport, 1957
Mr. Khrushchev has invited
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt,
to a solemn reception in honor of
her arrival in the Soviet Union.
The program...
Excuse me, Mr.James.
First, we will go to this address.
I must remind you that the even
First Lady of the United States,
has no right to be late.
We shall go!
Nikita Sergeyevich can wait.
It is a pleasure for a gentleman
to wait for a lady.
And who is this mysterious stranger,
who can make Nikita Sergeyevich wait?
I shall introduce you to this woman.
Battle for Sevastopol
I first saw Lyudmila in 1942,
at a student assembly...
International Students Antifascist Assembly, 1942
She was a tiny little girl.
She looked like a child dressed in uniform.
I wanted to know her closely, to see her smile.
Fang Hui, killed eight enemies.
Well done.
Krasavchenko Nikolai Prokofievich, the head
of the Soviet student delegation.
Communist.
I am very pleased.
Communists in the White House are rare.
And how many of the enemy
have you killed?
I am a party worker.
I prepare comrades for great acts.
It is very important!
Party worker. I prepare my comrades for great acts.
It's an important job.
Very good, very important.
Vladimir Pchelintsev, sniper.
Ah! Excellent...
And who are you?
I am a sniper.
A woman sniper?!
And how many men have you killed?
Not men, fascists.
Three hundred and nine.
What do you feel when you kill?
Where have learned to kill?
Where have you studied?
Kiev State University , 1937
Excuse me.
Excuse me, let me pass.
Lyuda! Hurray!
Get over here!
Come here!
We have been accepted!
Let's go to the park!
Come on, why aren't you happy?
No, I'm happy.
I'm buying beer? Come to the park!
No, I'm going home.
All right. We'll wait for you there!
Be sure to come!
Hooray!
History faculty:
Mom.
Mom, may I wear your dress today?
Yes, today you may.
I'm changing my clothes then and
coming to help you.
Budarin said, "Spanish war has shown, that
time to swing swords passed long by"
Vigernikov grabbed the sword,
and chased him down!
Luckily he was to slow.
I'll wait for you outside.
I'll change my clothes and we can go.
Hello, Father.
What an outfit.
Good, that my coat is not on you.
Bring me my boots.
I was accepted.
First on the list!
Well done, congratulations.
You can be proud of me.
Misha...be more gentle with her today.
Dad! When will you be back?
Dad?
Do not wait for me for dinner.
We invited the neighbors.
To celebrate my admission!
To celebrate what?
You had to enter and you did it.
Bravo!
Father!
Promise me, you'll come home not too late.
Lyuda?
Lyuda!
We are now historians.
We must strive for the truth.
In movies it is fairytale,
and in a shooting range it's real.
Your change, please.
Girls, come over here.
In the shooting range everything is real.
The cartridges are genuine,
the guns are real.
Shall we go?
The smell of gunpowder.
What gunpowder?
Why do we need to smell the gunpowder?
In movies it is not real,
but life has to be a fairytale. You promised me!
I choose a cinema too.
There is passion, love, music! And it never ends.
I'm voting for a shooting range.
Lyuda?!
Three against three.
Stop! Let me suggest a toss!
Heads - we shoot,
tails - cinema.
I bet a beer, that it's going to be heads.
I do not want to bet.
What was it?
Well?
Heads.
Guys, what takes you so long?
Start shooting.
Maybe we can make it to the cinema theater!
It's not just a shooting, it's the competition.
I 'd like that as well.
You can shoot after.
No, I want to compete.
That's right, show these cinema haters.
Pavlichenko, don't worry.
Fourth place is also honorable.
Each of you has five shots.
The winner is determined by points.
Could you tell me how?
Take the gun.
Load!
Insert the cartridges into the magazine.
Fire!
Align the rib with front sight and aim on the target,
breathe slowly...
Hold your breath and
gently press the trigger.
Then...fire.
Put the gun on the deck!
Put the gun on the deck.
Shout your family names,
loud and clear!
Kolesov.
Curzyh.
Feldman.
Pavlichenko!
Pavlichenko, as you can see, shooting
is not a women's job.
We'll see about that!
Look he can't find any holes on the target!
The winner is Pavlichenko.
Comrade commander,
have you checked really well?
You can go and see yourself.
How many Fieldman has?
Good that we didn't go to the cinema, right?
You asked for it, guys!
Every war ends with peace or ceasefire.
In 1651...
Excuse me, Pavlichenko.
Yes?
The Rector wants to see you.
Take your things, just in case.
Pavlichenko!
Here.
Pavlichenko Lyudmila Mikhailovna born 1916.
Mother, N.G.Pavlichenko, English teacher.
Father, M.S.Pavlichenko, NKVD Major.
Well.
Write it down, comrade Rector.
Is that accurate?
Yes.
You have a nerve.
The captain did not lie.
According to the report by Kovalchuk,
shooting instructor on June 20...
You showed excellent shooting skills.
You have talent.
We've decided to send you to a 6 month
precision strike training. Congratulations!
What about studies?
What about it?
I think the rectorate
is not against it.
After six months you will come back
and finish your studies, correct?
Yes, of course.
You will come back and finish
your studies then.
Can I reject it?
I recommend you to not
jump to that conclusion.
Take at least a sweater.
They will provide us everything.
What if they don't?
Here's a small pie.
They won't give you home baked pie there.
Aren't you going to say anything?
That's for half a year!
Misha, it's in the winter!
Father can call and they'll postpone it.
Lyuda!
You tried to make a boy from her all her life.
See, what happened? Why didn't you stop her?
Half of my life I've spent in wars.
The worst thing in  war is a woman.
And soon there will be another war.
We are thankful for the
US loan and rental program,
"USA, International student assembly, 1942"
but if we together want to defeat
Hitler as quickly as possible,
then you need to take a decisive stand.
The Soviet delegation requests
to make the opening of the second front
as the main topic of the Assembly.
Here.
The Soviet people need help,
but do not need alms.
So on behalf of the
Soviet delegation,
I will ask you to end these ugly jokes immediately!
People want to help you,
and you call it a joke?
Is my money not good enough for fighting Hitler?
Someone in your position shouldn't be fussy,
any amount would help. And why is the main
member of the delegation silent?
I'm talking about miss Pavlichenko, Lady Death.
Lyuda, speak!
Pavlichenko?
We the students Assembly, agree...
but to bring the opening
of the second front...
that is the area of concern of
politicians and military men.
To bring it on to the agenda
is not in our plans.
Mrs. Roosevelt, many of us
have the impression,
that this was the beginning of the next
election campaign for your husband.
Are you planning to spend your
entire life in the White House?
And why not let us
ask questions?
This may affect that Americans will
spill their blood on foreign land.
I know one thing for sure, it is useful to
have friends, who can give you weapons.
But it's even better, when you have
friends who would take
his weapon and fights side by side with you.
Your English is suspiciously good
for a regular soldier...
Were you specially trained for this?
Who are you anyway? I need the truth.
My mother taught me English.
She was an English teacher.
In University I studied history.
First in Kiev, then in Odessa...
how we got to be here?
For the whole summer... no, for the whole life!
Odessa, June 1941.
I thought... History! We will
dig Troy's royal tombs, mounds!
What we can dig here, tell me!
Just take a look, it's awful!
Your documents are ready.
Here they are.
Come on Monday. Goodbye.
Thank you!
Lyuda, do you like sailors?
I like militia men.
Militia men?
Why?
If you do not work, I'll call them.
Exams soon. Where is your mind wandering?
Well, I still would like a sailor.
I would wait and wait for him to come back...
Go to the beach, girls.
There will be sailors and airmen!
And even militia men.
An elegant choice.
Did you hear, militia men!
Sonichka...Sonia!
They do not understand.
It's Friday already, I have
to close the archives soon.
I understand you, I also would like to have a word with them.
Yes! Yes! Yes.
Sonichka, tell me who do you prefer,
sailors or airmen?
You know, take a doctor.
Where?
I'm going to the beach.
My brother Borya is going to be there.
He is a doctor. Is he good looking?
As a child he had a dream of becoming a pilot.
That's it, I want a doctor!
Let's go. Lyuda, you will bury us alive here.
Lyuda, you have to learn to relax.
Alright.
On Monday morning we continue.
We'll start in the...
...early morning.
What do you think, Dr. Koifman himself
said after the surgery?
Boris, you have hands of gold!
Do you understand, what he said?
He say, that my Boris has golden hands.
He will soon go to Kiev and
perhaps even Moscow.
Sit down!
Lyuda, this happened only once.
What happened?
Heat stroke. Sit down, Masha!
Yes, sit down.
Lyuda, what if the war breaks out?
Everyone talks about the war now.
Girls...sorry about that!
We're sorry.
That happened by accident!
How can we make it up to you?
Masha has put this all behind!
You may go now!
Masha, nice to meet you! Grisha.
I'm Nikolay.
Well...what are you reading?
Hey, get back here!
We will win and return to
celebrate our victory. Follow me.
Masha?
Lyuda! Who do you like more, Kolya or Grisha?
I haven't looked at them.
So look then!
Sonya!
Borya!
Hello.
Masha.
Meet my brother, Borya.
Hello.
Masha, let's go swimming!
May I sit by you.
Sure.
Thank you.
I recognized you immediately.
And what did Sonya tell you about me?
She asked me to shave, spray cologne,
polish my shoes and get to the beach.
To impress you.
That's it?
No, she wanted me to see you in a swimsuit
and understand that I have to marry you.
Did you?
Boris.
Lyudmila.
But if seriously...
They are airmen!
I need some time.
Yes...a very interesting book, Lyuda.
So...it is Lyuda.
Nice to see you again.
Lyudmila.
Masha.
As promised, you are invited to
join in to celebrate our victory.
And for you, young man,
you are welcome to join as well.
I disagree with you.
How can you be against war?
It will create a fair world.
And we will create it!
No, that opinion is very popular today.
But I never believed it.
You are wasting your fume.
There will be no war.
I can see better from above,
the war has already begun.
You are afraid to admit it.
And that's your weakness.
Why?
Because you're a coward.
You want others to protect families, country, women.
Can you protect anybody?
Protect...no.
But to save lives, yes!
Time for a toast?
Let's drink to...
For the ball that bounced!
Yes exactly!
To the ball!
To the ball!
Lyuda, have you flown in a plane?
Unfortunately, no.
We are making training flights on Sunday.
Thank you, Nikolay, but on Sunday...
Lyuda and Masha have been
invited to our home by Boris...
to lunch. He stands here quietly
and girls almost flew away.
Sonia I'm sorry, I would like to go flying.
Lyudmila, join Masha.
Or I can fly away as well.
You're the only child in family?
Yes.
And where do you live in Kiev?
Do you live in a house or an apartment block?
In a residential block.
Shared housing?
No, separately.
How many rooms do you have?
Three and it's 2.9m in height,
parqueted floors, IV floor
with large windows an telephone.
Why do you ask all this nonsense.
Lyusik, this is not nonsense.
Lyudmila, tell me, have you thought about,
how many children you would have?
How many boys?
And what is the most important thing
for you in your husband?
00:23:29,178 --> 00:23:31,300
If he earns good money?
If he loves you dearly?
Father, mother, don't tire our guest.
No, no, this is interesting.
I...I haven't thought about all this.
We have baked fish coming up!
What do you think about our son Borya?
I know him hardly.
Oh, I will tell you.
Borya is our big problem.
He is a very good boy.
All best things in Odessa we've invested in him!
He graduated school with a gold medal.
It's hard to get into a
Medical Institut in Odessa.
You know what Koifman said about him?
That he has golden hands.
Lyusik, it is known even in Kiev!
But that's not important!
My son can make people around him happy.
And when he meets this woman,
he will give her a wedding ring!
Borya, get the ring and show it to Lyudochka!
Lyudmila...don't expect to much.
The ring isn't particularly valuable,
Mother: When Lyusik gave me a ring,
Boris: it isn't even gold.
Mother: he had higher rank than Deriba!
Father: this is one more value of our family,
Sonia is an outstanding cook!
Dad!
Here's a joke...a grandfather in a Jewish family is dying.
He lays on the couch, his soul is leaving...
when a boy came into the room.
Grandpa says, 'Come on, son'.
'Grandma has prepared fish.
I smell great fragrance from the kitchen' .
'Ask grandma to bring me a bite.'
The little Fima goes and returns.
Boy says, Grandma said, 'We'll save it for later...'
Do you understand?
You know what that means?
Laughing? Turn on the radio, it has begun!
What has begun?
Listen!
Radio: The Soviet Union,
was attacked by German troops
without a declaration of war.
Radio: Attacking our borders...
What did I tell you?
Bombing Zhitomir, Kiev...
It's all over.
Radio: Sevastopol, Kaunas and some others.
No, it's...
Radio: ...killed and wounded over 200 people.
it's not over.
Father: Hitler had his agenda, we have ours.
Borya, me and your mother insist you to take Lyuda to the theater.
Radio: Raids of enemy aircrafts and gunning...
Father: Today's play is the 'La Traviata'.
Radio:  ...were made from Romanian and Finnish territory.
What has your father said?
We must go now or we'll be late.
Lyuda, we don't have to do this.
War is not a place for women.
War is not a place for cowards.
Young people, be quiet!
Lyuda?
The war is a massacre.
I am a doctor, I can make a booking.
Please understand, you cannot participate...
You're right, Boris, but...
Dad said that I must do it.
I wouldn't be able to hole up here, I'd be ashamed.
And you? Could you do that?
I'm more needed here.
Everyone does their part.
And I finished course of precision strike.
They need me more over there.
Get back to the opera.
Lyuda!
Here we are strangers.
USSR Embassy, USA, 1942
There is a war going on and here...
and here all they care is if I'm with silk
underwear and what lipstick I wear.
Lyuda, can you explain what this is?
What were you whispering about
with the President's wife in English?
Nikolay?
What have you agreed to?
Could you explain normally?
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt has
invited Miss Pavlichenko
to live in the White House
during her visit to America.
And only Pavlichenko was invited!
Do we have any instructions
on this occasion?
Soviet citizens have never been in the
White House without a delegation.
I may not to go anywhere!
We must hold on to every chance!
Important issues are solved in the presidential premises.
It'd better to have our man there.
Well...
You know, Miss Pavlichenko...
make this decision yourself.
It will be hot next week.
What kind of clothes we should to give her?
I need her in uniform.
The press are used to see her that way.
Have you done everything I asked?
Certainly.
I wanted to understand her
as a woman.
How could she kill 309 men
in cold blood?
Why did she take firearm?
It is not a woman's job.
Our journalists called her 'Lady Death'.
I noticed, how it stung her.
She was smart and well educated.
She was a beauty!
But war just came to her home,
and she really had no choice.
Especially, she had talent
to be unseen and aim perfectly.
Training camps, summer 1941
Sniper's first task:
get into position without being noticed.
To accomplish this you need to
crawl facing down on your stomach.
Keep your butt down!
Lower!
Move your left foot, move the rifle
and then move your right foot.
Glide, do not wriggle! Arm on sling swivel mount.
Lower your head. Faster, faster.
You are dead! Protruded butt!
Excellent target for an enemy.
Sergeant major!
How will you fight with all this?
Stop neighing!
I can see that you don't
believe the Germans...
took Zhitomir, Riga, and now is
heading to Kiev and Leningrad!
We anticipated a short war
and a quick victory.
But we had to withdraw.
And suffered huge losses!
And tomorrow you are going
to be these losses! And you!
All non statutory things has to be burned.
Do it now!
Wider steps!
With strength!
Faster.
Go on!
Dig deeper!
Lower your butt and crawl away!
Move quickly, do it together!
Move around!
Report the changes!
A stone disappeared.
Cross too.
The hay-straw is moved to the left.
Five meters.
The tussock moved to the place of the stump.
Is that it?
The stone was moved to the left, one meter.
Not bad.
Turn around!
Types of camouflage
Incorrect! Let's see...
This is the correct position.
You're dead.
Interesting decision but ineffective.
She is dead. Flowers do not belong in this meadow.
Comrade major, you are dead.
When do we start to shoot?
Pavlichenko.
Here!
Do you still want to shoot?
Yes sir!
Are you sure?
I am sure of it.
Position!
Comrade major, move away.
Shoot.
You are a sniper, not an artilleryman.
Nine. Not bad for a starter.
The first five on the
firing line, action!
All shoot two ammunition allowances.
At your command.
Conscript the men, leave the girls behind.
They have a lot to learn.
They haven't even fired once,
bullet supply just arrived.
All have passed a course on shooting.
Half a year they have shot there.
It's a pity.
I feel sorry about my men too.
Less than half of them left.
Listen,
you will have to protect one girl.
She is going to be great soldier... Pavlichenko.
Odessa, September, 1941.
Do not let them too close.
When you see an officer, shoot!
If you killed the commander,
you'd kill half of the squad.
Save ammunition. Questions?
Tanks, comrade captain.
A tank can be stopped in two ways.
First, with grenades from a short range,
And number two?
Number two...
Shoot to the tank's eye slit with
armor-piercing rounds.
Shoot twice at the same spot
and the glass will crack.
With the third shot kill the driver.
Understood.
Captain, give me armor-piercing rounds.
Bombers!
Are you hurt? Where are you hurt?
Is that your blood?
Take a swig...it's alcohol.
Wait here.
Major General Petrov, Commander of
a semi-automatic SVT rifle to Red Army
soldier Pavlichenko for the destroyed tank.
Aviation plays a separate role
in wiping out enemy troops.
Squad, attention!
Soldier Pavlichenko, leave the line!
Yes, sir!
Ah!
Pavlichenko, Mikhailovna?
Your father is Michail Yurievich?
He fought in the Civil War?
Yes, sir!
Misha is our hero!
Well...
If you need anything, let me know.
Congratulations, combatant Pavlichenko!
Thank you, comrade general.
Comrades!
This is my battle friend's daughter
from the Civil War.
See her as a role model!
Come, say something to our soldiers.
I swear...
to not spare myself in this
fight against the enemy.
To kill a 100 fascists with this gun!
Dismiss them, commander.
Dismissed!
Makarov.
Keep an eye out for her, if she
follows the path of her father...
You understand, right?
Yes.
You should always adjust
new gun to yourself.
There are no identical rifles.
Each rifle has a character.
You need to understand it and handle
the rifle as you would your wife.
Do you have a wife, comrade captain?
No, I do not.
I had a wife, once.
At first I was afraid to marry.
I came back after Finnish war. I could not believe
that such a young and beautiful girl loves me.
At the beginning of the war...
I wasn't able to save her.
I was too late.
Lyuda!
Masha.
Lyuda!
Masha!
Finally I found you!
I have so much to tell you.
We will fight together, me, you and Grisha.
Who is Grisha?
Don't you remember?
My pilot Grisha.
Grisha is mine!
And is he yours?
He is going to be soon.
Miss Pavlichenko, what do you think,
can Russia defeat Fascism
on his own without our help?
USA, White House, 1942
Currently the Soviet Union
fights with Fascism alone.
But the fascist aggression
is the problem of the Worlde.
And you are not aggressor?!
Then explain Finland and now the Polish occupation!
The increase of prison camps in the Soviet Union.
You are even fighting against your own people!
You have not seen how we lived before.
And you have no right...
I am a Russian!
And miraculously left Russia in 1928.
I have every right to talk about it.
Gentlemen!
Do...do sit down.
My apologies, but the press conference is now over.
Thank you for all your questions.
Lyudmila, your mistake is that you looked
for discussion in to the direction you need.
Always begin knowing precisely what you
are going to say and always be confident.
And confidence comes with a smile.
More softly...naturally.
The smile is your main weapon.
It's hard to talk like that...
Of course this is hard.
It takes years of practice.
And you must hold that smile as long as you can.
Speak loudly, confidently.
And always look the person directly in the eyes.
Try to relax. Remember something, that makes you smile.
Comrade captain, I got three more.
Odessa, September 1941.
Write down the statement, comrade captain.
We are the witnesses. She killed two on spot.
And she waited for the third.
We even made a bet. German had lit up the
cigarette thinking he was invisible,
she shot and we had to crawl.
Here.
Now you can see how harmful smoking is.
Take it.
Lyuda, come to intelligence service in the evening.
We will surround you with warmth and care.
Here is warm too.
We will wait for you anyway.
There Lyuda,
you are going to get a medal.
Comrade captain...have you had
direct hits in the night?
I have had my moments.
I remember in Finland, was out sniping.
Interesting position occurred.
If I aimed from that position like this
I would clear three targets simultaneously.
I go out to that position and wait.
Boom! And that would be it.
But in the statement they
had written only one.
They didn't believe it!
I made only the single shot.
Three?
Krepchuk.
Yes.
Where is Pavlichenko?
Went to the right, she changed positions.
Help me.
Pavlichenko, come here!
Pavlichenko, who authorized you
to leave your position?
Can we talk about this later?
******.
Danke dir.
That's it...
Come on! Get up!
What are you doing, fool!?
What?
You showed me yesterday how to kill three with one shot.
If it were not you, I would have shot my 73rd!
They could kill you!
And you too.
Wait.
Do you want to be tried by a
court-martial for your excesses?
Get back to your position.
Understood.
Comrade captain, at the right side of the forest
next to the shell crater.
Is wounded good for account?
Write down on more for me.
Calm down, you blockhead.
Stop!
It hurts.
Today I saved two.
That would make it my 20th.
No, my 21st.
Blow on it.
I shot 73 Germans.
Could have been more,
had it not been for Makarov.
Give me permission to land here.
Permission is given!
Hello, Lyuda.
I missed you so much!
Hello, captain.
Why do you sew it yourself? You have
women subordinates at your disposal, ask them.
I love to sew, it calms me.
New orders: to begin preparations for troops
evacuation to the Crimea.
The troops will assemble at the port.
Your task is to provide the cover.
Here...
and here.
We're leaving tomorrow.
Why surrender Odessa?
We can still resist them.
Authorities know better.
I am myself from Odessa.
It kills my soul to imagine fascists
creeping around Dyuk's monument.
Can I take short cut over to Prishtup troops.
Yes, but stick to the left.
Well, take care.
Come on, let me through.
I have no breaks.
Let's drink.
Let's drink to Odessa.
To the city, which...
To the city where I fell in love.
It seems we are out of fuel.
I have it, one second.
Excuse me.
Wait!
That's an order.
Grisha!
I  wanted for a long time to
be alone with you.
Why?
That's enough! Don't do it!
I do not love you.
We are grown people.
War and death is everywhere.
Tomorrow we may be killed.
It hurts! Let me go!
My groin...
Thanks, but there is no need
to save me so often.
You could tell me right away,
you have a man.
I told you.
Forgive me.
Why?
I have promised.
To whom?
To myself.
Let me help you.
This you can do.
I can't.
Is it because of your wife?
Because of the war.
If you were killed...
You are a coward, comrade captain.
We have to believe we
are not going to be killed.
Lyuda! Can you hear me?
Breathe!
Just a little more.
Come on!
Can you hear me?
Quiet. I managed to take you out.
Makar, Makar...
I love you.
Quiet, quiet now.
Go to sleep.
Everything will be fine now.
Boris Larionovich, Polyakov has
a fever and delirium again.
Well...change his bandage.
What bandage, Boris Larionovich?
Oh, excuse me.
Doctor! Doctor.
I have a personal request.
This fighter Pavlichenko
is very valuable and important.
Take good care of her.
We take care of  all patients.
She is not 'all'.
She's special...
I know she is special!
I love her too. And I've loved
her for a long time..
So I can be rest assured,
you will take good care of her.
She later will decide herself,
who she is going to stay with.
Too bad you haven't
taken care of her.
The White House, Washington D.C, 1942
This needs to be poured into the pan for the Borscht.
Borscht...
No, soft and more naturally.
Borscht...
Borscht.
In the Soviet Union, women do this.
In America women do this!
What a day!
It's alright! It's only a frying pan.
Sorry...
What happened?
I was covered...in earth five minutes
and nearly died.
I can only imagine...
how terrible it has been.
Sevastopol Evacuation, Autumn 1941
Take it.
Eat.
Lyuda, I wanted to ask you...
Dear, do not be afraid.
Fear not, everything will be fine.
Grisha is flying over us.
There, look!
He flies above! Fear not, drink.
Soon you will see Makar.
Do not be afraid.
How are you?
I will be back soon.
- Get up. - I have to
You are not a soldier.
Get up, you have a disability.
You won't get to the front anymore.
You do not understand, I have to.
Under these conditions
I cannot heal you!
So treat me.
Come on, cure me!
I'll testify to the commission you are not able!
I'm a doctor, not a magician.
The headquarters of Sevastopol
defensive area. November 1941.
Ivan Evtimovich!
Hello, Lyudmila.
Please sign the report that I am healthy.
Bravo, good to see you are able.
Here, come with me.
Let's drink some tea.
What happened to your arm?
She's with me.
Wait here a moment.
We have received an order from
headquarters to protect the city!
At any cost.
This is General Petrov.
He arrived from the first line of defense.
And he likely has suggestions.
Please, General.
The first line of defense is
now in 13 km from Sevastopol.
Thus the city is vulnerable to German artillery.
We cannot drive the enemy back.
Even if we could, the defense
line would stretch,
and we will not be able to defend it.
How to protect the city.
One hit with 305mm linkorov caliber shrapnel
covers the area with width of 250 meters
and a length of 1 km.
Only on the battleship 'Paris Commune' alone
are 12 guns of this type.
They can crush the artillery of enemy.
But as far as I know, your order dispatched
almost all the ships to the Caucasus.
I deem it necessary to bring the
ships back immediately!
My task is to protect the fleet.
And in this situation I have no right...
Our common task is to protect Sevastopol!
Theater of operations has moved on land long
time ago. Your inability and unwillingness,
to learn how to fight in this field is
leading to a great number of deaths of sailors.
They don't want to dig trenches, to blend in.
They don't want to crawl on their bellies.
Why can't you change uniform?
Our uniform is our pride.
Comrades, meet Sergeant Lyudmila Pavlichenko.
As they say, God sent. She's a sniper.
Tell us now, in real combat situation
who has more chances to survive,
me with protective shirt
or this man in black uniform jacket?
I would kill a uniform jacket first.
I would have to seek for you,
comrade General.
That's that.
Thank you, Lyudmila.
Dyachenko! Prepare orders to change the uniforms.
Ivan Efimovich!
And my report?
If the doctors allow it,
you may fight in full force.
Anyone seriously wounded?
Comrade Major, get out of the way!
How many beds do we have available?
Boris, I need the note I'm healthy.
Sign here.
Boris Efimich, Sidorenko has a massive blood
loss, needs amputation of both limbs.
Take him straight up to the
Zhuk, severe liver damage.
Zhuk?!
Send him to the 1st hospital.
Vadim!
Where? Where is our squad?
Where is she?
Look, there they are.
Lyuda!
How good that you are here.
I promised Makarov.
He really wanted this be yours.
That's the way it is in the war.
We have to live.
We have to live.
Boris!
Lyuda.
Where did you go?
I need to the front lines. Sign it.
No offense, but...
You are not cured after contusion.
It would be murder to send you there.
I cannot do this.
Makarov died.
Did you hear me?
Excuse me.
Stay here Boris!
You do not you understand, with this, I can...
'Suitable for service'.
Thank you, Borya!
USA, White House, 1942
Yes!
I am ready.
Close your eyes.
Don't peek!
Open them.
This is for you.
Close your eyes.
Don't peek!
Open.
It is so sad that nobody
sees the woman in you.
People...
don't always see the woman in the lead.
When it all began between
Franklin and I, I was so happy.
Oh! He was intelligent and
successful and handsome.
Why did he pay attention to me?
I wasn't at all beautiful, I was so tall.
And he chose me.
I'm your new boss.
Let's go to kill fascists!
Masha, you fool!
Sevastopol, November 1941.
Hey, Lyuda.
Look what I brought!
I traded alcohol for it.
And so...
Voila! Voila!
The smaller one for me,
bigger one for you.
Thank you.
Thank you...what kind of 'thank you' is this?
'Thank you'.
I'm going to freeze.
We will walk and lay on these stones.
We still have to bear children in the future.
Let's go together next time.
We can visit Grisha as well.
He has been very lonely,
since they shot down Nikolay.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Have you seen your new commanding officer?
Does he look good?
No.
He is not handsome?
I have not seen him.
Can you imagine, maybe he is some old man.
And if he were young...
he would definitely start to harass.
Captain Leonid Kitsenko,
your new commanding officer.
Welcome to the table.
We have special tasks.
Diversions behind enemy lines,
hunting down enemy snipers.
Do we start tomorrow?
Yes.
Are we allowed to take the dog-tags from the bodies?
Lyudmila, eat.
Stand down.
Retreat.
Follow me!
Stop. Stop!
About face!
We can't do that,
we are not fascists.
Why didn't you let me kill him?
They do not deserve an easy death.
They killed... -It's not about them.
It's about you.
You can't live your life for the sake of revenge.
War is not only death,
it is also...  That's life.
If you do not find out
what to live for in the wartime,
you'll get killed.
They can kill me. Why do you care?
I don't want to lose another partner.
Both of you, here are two positions,
precise and dangerous tactic.
It's a long shot.
Listen to your heart.
Shoot between heartbeats.
Taking a photograph.
Take it.
Schnappsen.
Let's drink.
Here is to the medal for Grisha!
He did like this, I did like that and went behind him...
shot and he went down!
Celebrating.
For them it is Christmas!
If you don't want to give to
the fascist with the rifle
your home, wife, mother,
all that you call homeland.
Remember that no one will save the motherland,
if you do not save her yourself!
Remember that no one will kill him,
if you do not kill him!
Kill the fascist, so that him was laying
on the ground but not you.
So that the grief was in his home
but not in yours.
So kill at least one!
Kill him quicker!
As many times you see him,
as many times kill him!
This night Hitler wanted to celebrate
the New Year in Sevastopol.
But thanks to our persistence,
we're celebrating for the second time!
We have pushed the enemy
from the city walls!
Sevastopol is alive.
Sevastopol will live!
Leonid, meet my friend Boris.
I knew him  before the war.
Boris.
Leonid.
In connection with  delivery of the ammunition
I command to begin immediately
liquidation of 1,500 cases of champagne
and to vacate tunnels.
Happy New Year 1942!
Hurrah, comrades!
To comrade Stalin!
Wait! Do not open it.
I'll bring cups.
Last time we drank champagne
with darling at my house.
How long have you known her?
I fell in love with her before the war.
If it weren't for her,
I wouldn't be here.
Do you regret it?
That I fell in love?
That you are in a war.
No, then I would have to regret
that I fell in love with her.
And here I can see her sometimes.
And you?
Do you love her?
Hands off! What are you doing?!
You spend time only with officers?
Officer scum!
We have to beat the Germans, not each other!
Happy New Year.
I thought this happens differently.
USA, Chicago 1942
Excuse me, Miss Pavlichenko.
I came here without my agent.
I have an offer. I have project for you.
Look, these are cigarettes.
I'll give you a million bucks if you allow me
to print your photo on my cigarettes, and then....
That man is my agent.
That guy?
Yes! Talk to him.
Thank you.
Sorry about the wait.
My guitar also kills.
A good weapon.
Thank you, everyone has their own weapon.
Let's go to my dressing room.
it's impossible to talk.
I've something for you.
Miss Pavlichenko...
Lyuda!
Pavlichenko!
What were you thinking?
Are you insane?
I'm your agent?
Miss Pavlichenko, let me ask you two questions.
Please. Hold on. Hold on.
Listen to me!
Miss Pavlichenko, do you really think the
President will forgo his election promise,
and sends our soldiers away to
die on foreign land?
Sorry!
Please.
At the press conference, they'll ask you a lot
harder questions and you won't be able to answer.
You are more popular than me,
Miss Pavlichenko.
Do you like it?
Yes, I like it.
I've written  this song about you.
May I perform it for my fans?
No one dedicated me a song.
Sevastopol, Spring 1942
You know, I've decided having
a boy with Grisha.
Masha, you are crazy.
I want to have something
that belongs to me, in here.
Grisha is not against it.
Lyuda!
I have news!
What, Masha?
Come, I will tell you.
Come tomorrow to our wedding.
Where?
To the wedding.
To the wedding, to have fun!
We are going to have fun.
Aunt Lyuda!
How many have you killed today?
Two.
It's OK.
It's not enough.
Aunt Lyuda, look!
Excellent.
You can see that I can aim too!
Will you teach me to shoot a gun?
Me too...
I will teach you everything.
But not right now. Practice this for now.
I'm Lyuda! No, I'm Lyuda!
Watch out!
You are late.
I'm sorry.
I invited you to the wedding,
and it turned out to be the wake.
Grisha has been killed.
Let's drink as a farewell.
I don't regret it.
No doubt war kills people.
But we thought, if we were together...
it wouldn't be so scary.
Being together is always better, Lyuda.
We have to love.
We should celebrate!
Lyonya... I want a boy.
You told me that war is such a life.
Yes.
Good morning.
Good morning.
USA, Chicago 1942
Pavlichenko, what is all this masquerade?
Get out of that dress immediately.
Let them see that I'm a woman.
You're not a woman, you're a Soviet soldier.
Remember that!
You'll come out. Stalin, we've common enemy, second front.
No actions on your own!
Are we clear?
Yes, sir.
What have they done to you?
I cannot take it anymore.
The men should have protected you.
Sevastopol, Summer 1942
Lyuda?
Lyuda, you...
Help!
Help!
Help! Lyonya!
Help!
Leonid!
Leonid!
Lyonya!
Where is...Lyonya!
Where is Lyonya?
Quiet. Lyonya died.
Calm down, listen to me.
I am guilty! The war is over for you.
You are discharged and unfit for military service.
Who are you going to discharge here?
Pavlichenko is not an ordinary soldier now.
She is a symbol, and symbols can't be discharged.
Leave the hospital immediately!
Do you want a military tribunal?
This is not a sanatorium
for pre-war girlfriends.
Haven't you read this?!
The Germans say, they have killed her.
Third assault is approaching.
My soldiers fight with her name on their lips.
I will complain to General Petrov.
It's his order to put her on her feet.
We need her in the front.
Put your hands up. Hold it.
Let me do it.
Higher?
She does not look particularly heroic.
Smile.
Raise your head.
Be merrier.
Attention.
Comrade Commissioner.
Pavlichenko, come in.
Take a look.
One of the best German snipers,
Otto von Singer.
He came for you!
They believed you are still alive.
Your photo worked.
According to our intelligence,
his nests were found in this area.
I won't be able, comrade Commissioner.
Lyuda, drop it. Do you understand
how important is to win this duel?
He is best sniper, I am not anymore.
The report from the military doctor says,
I am unfit for military service.
Do you understand how many of your
comrades-in-arms this Singer is going to kill?
I won't be able.
You have to do this, it's not for me...
I won't be able...
it's not for you.
Do this for Leonid Kitsenko.
Okay.
Okay...
I need to see the Major General, please.
Comrade Major General...
what have you got there?
We must evacuate Sergeant Pavlichenko,
as soon as possible.
How about others? We are now preparing
evacuation of archive and documentation.
Of all the people I have right to evacuate
only Party workers and valuable specialists.
I have my orders.
Hundreds of dead Germans.
Four times wounded in battle,
contusion.
She is a woman, after all.
Isn't she valuable?
Does she not deserve that?
We are Soviet people!
Let us through!
I am a military doctor!
I am a Party worker!
Lyuda, wait, I'm...
Where you're going!
Back!
Lyuda!
Stop this panic!
Boris, wait.
The sea smells like in Odessa...
as then...
Sonia took us to the beach and said,
you'd see me in swimsuit.
Sonia's fish, 'La Traviata',
your parents, family ring...
The archive...
Wait, you remember the ring?
I always knew, that one day
I will give it to you..
You know we would have five children.
Wow, five, Boris?
Sonia  would teach you
how to cook.
I know how to make dumplings.
Well, we would sit at the big table.
Yes, everyday.
Every day, except when we go to the opera.
No, Borya. I don't like opera.
I prefer cinema.
Quick, we are running out of time.
Be careful with her!
Lyuda, take your suitcase,
there is everything you need.
Boris, what about you?
We are ready to dive!
I will take the next steamer.
I am a Jew from Odessa, I'll get out of here.
Borya! Let me go. Wait.
Get ready to the emergency dive!
Borya! Boris!
Let me go.
Wait! Stop!
Borya!
Lyudmila opened for me one of the most
terrible pages of this great war.
The defense of Sevastopol
lasted 250 days,
but the city was seized.
Neither military fighters nor
citizens were evacuated.
General Petrov and several dozen
officers from the command,
were evacuated by submarine.
With aircrafts, submarines and boats
were evacuated about 3000 people
from Sevastopol to the Caucasus.
Admiral Oktyabarskiy, was evacuated on a plane.
It was a miracle Lyudmila stayed alive.
A miracle, granted by a man,
who never had a chance to propose.
But he gave his pass to escape and
it was a pass for a future life.
Boris who loved Lyuda, her best friend Masha,
and about 80,000 defenders
and inhabitants of Sevastopol
ended up face to face with enemy.
Most of them were sentenced
to death and captivity.
Lyuda often said to me ,
that they all were heroes.
USA, Chicago, 1942
Gentlemen...I'm 25 years old.
And I have killed 309
fascist occupants by now.
Don't you think, gentlemen,
that you have been hiding behind
my back for too long?
We became friends.
From her letters I know
she did not turn back to the front.
She worked as an instructor
at snipers school.
After the war Lyuda
finished university.
She was awarded the highest rank:
Hero of the Soviet Union.
Moscow, 1957
She won all her wars, as a soldier,
as a diplomat, and as a woman!
I want to see her son.
I'm sure he'll look just like her.
Yes, Mr. Khrushchev can probably wait.
