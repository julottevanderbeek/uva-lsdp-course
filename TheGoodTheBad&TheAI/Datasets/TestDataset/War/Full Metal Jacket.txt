"America has heard the bugle call
"And you know it involves us one and all
"I don't suppose that war will ever end
"There's fighting
that will break us up again
"Good-bye, my darling
Hello, Vietnam
"I'm here to take a battle to be won
"Kiss me good-bye
And write me while I'm gone
"Good-bye, my sweetheart
Hello, Vietnam"
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman,
your senior drill instructor.
You will speak only when spoken to.
The first and last words
out of your sewers will be "Sir!"
Do you maggots understand?
Sir, yes, sir!
I can't hear you.
Sound off like you got a pair.
Sir, yes, sir!
If you ladies leave my island,
if you survive recruit training...
...you will be a weapon,
a minister of death, praying for war.
But until that day, you are pukes!
The lowest form of life on Earth.
You are not even human fucking beings!
You are only unorganized,
grab-asstic pieces of amphibian shit!
Because I am hard, you won't like me.
The more you hate me,
the more you'll learn.
I am hard, but I am fair!
There is no racial bigotry here!
I do not look down on niggers,
kikes, wops or greasers.
Here, you are all equally worthless!
My orders are to weed out non-hackers...
...who do not pack the gear
to be in my beloved Corps!
Do you maggots understand that?
Sir, yes, sir!
Bullshit! I can't hear you!
Sir, yes, sir!
-What's your name, scumbag?
-Sir, Private Brown, sir!
From now on you're Private Snowball!
Like that name?
Sir, yes, sir!
There's one thing you won't like!
They don't serve fried chicken
and watermelon...
...in my mess hall!
SNOWBALL: Sir, yes, sir!
Is that you, John Wayne?
Is this me?
HARTMAN: Who said that?
Who the fuck said that?
Who's the slimy communist cocksucker
down here...
...who just signed his own death warrant?
Nobody, huh?
The fairy fucking godmother said it!
Out-fucking-standing!
I will P.T. you all until you die!
I will P.T. you until your assholes
suck buttermilk!
-Was it you, you little fuck?
-Sir, no, sir!
You look like a fucking worm!
I bet it was you!
Sir, no, sir!
Sir, I said it, sir!
Well, no shit.
What are you, a fucking comedian?
Private Joker.
I admire your honesty.
I like you. Come over to my house
and fuck my sister!
HARTMAN: You little scumbag!
I've got your name! I've got your ass!
You will not laugh or cry!
You will learn by the number!
HARTMAN: Get up! Get on your feet!
Unfuck yourself or I'll unscrew
your head and shit down your neck!
Sir, yes, sir!
-Why did you join my beloved Corps?
-Sir, to kill, sir!
-You're a killer!
-Sir, yes, sir!
-Let me see your war face!
-Sir!
You've got a war face?
That's a war face! Let me see yours!
You didn't convince me!
Let me see your real war face!
-You don't scare me! Work on it!
-Sir, yes, sir!
What's your excuse?
Sir, excuse, sir?
I'm asking the fucking questions,
understand?
Sir, yes, sir!
Thank you!
Can I be in charge for a while?
Sir, yes, sir!
Are you shook up? Nervous?
Sir, I am, sir!
Do I make you nervous?
-Sir!
-Sir, what?
-Were you about to call me an asshole?
-Sir, no, sir!
-How tall are you, Private?
-Sir, 5'9", sir!
I didn't know they stacked shit that high!
-Trying to squeeze an inch in on me?
-Sir, no, sir!
The best part of you ran down
the crack of your mama's ass...
...and ended up as a brown stain
on the mattress!
-Where in hell are you from?
-Sir, Texas, sir!
Holy dogshit! Only steers and queers
come from Texas, Private Cowboy!
You don't look like a steer,
so that narrows it down!
-Suck dicks?
-Sir, no, sir!
-You a peter-puffer?
-Sir, no, sir!
I bet you would fuck
a person in the ass...
...and not have the courtesy
to give him a reach-around!
I'll be watching you!
-Your parents have children that lived?
-Sir, yes, sir!
Bet they regret that!
You're so ugly
you're a modern-art masterpiece!
-What's your name, fatbody?
-Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir!
-Lawrence, what, of Arabia?
-Sir, no, sir!
That name sounds like royalty!
You royalty?
Sir, no, sir!
-You suck dicks?
-Sir, no, sir!
Bet you could suck a golf ball
through a garden hose!
Sir, no, sir!
I don't like that name!
Faggots and sailors are called Lawrence!
-From now on you're Gomer Pyle!
-Sir, yes, sir!
Think I'm cute, Private Pyle?
Think I'm funny?
Sir, no, sir!
-Then wipe off that disgusting grin!
-Sir, yes, sir!
Any fucking time, sweetheart!
I'm trying, sir!
I'll give you three seconds...
...exactly three fucking seconds...
...to wipe off that stupid grin...
...or I will gouge out your eyeballs
and skull-fuck you!
One, two, three.
-Sir, I can't help it, sir!
-Get on your knees, scumbag!
HARTMAN: Now choke yourself!
HARTMAN: Goddamn it, with my hand,
numb-nuts!
HARTMAN: Don't pull my hand over there!
I said choke yourself!
Lean forward and choke yourself!
HARTMAN: Are you through grinning?
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!
Bullshit! I can't hear you!
Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Bullshit! I still can't hear you!
Sound off like you got a pair!
Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: That's enough.
Get on your feet!
Pyle, square your ass away and
start shitting me Tiffany cuff links...
...or I will definitely fuck you up!
Sir, yes, sir!
JOKER: Parris Island, South Carolina...
...the United States Marine Corps
Recruit Depot.
An eight-week college
for the phony-tough and the crazy-brave.
HARTMAN:
"Mama and Papa were laying in bed!"
"Mama rolled over
and this is what she said:
"'Oh, give me some...
"'...P.T.!'
"Good for you and good for me!
"Mmm, good!
"Up in the morning to the rising sun!
"Gotta run all day...
"...till the running's done!
"Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch!
"Got the blueballs, crabs
and the seven-year itch!"
Left shoulder, hut!
What are you trying to do
to my beloved Corps?
Sir, I don't know, sir!
Do you expect me to believe
that you don't know left from right?
Sir, no, sir!
You did that on purpose!
You want to be different!
Sir, no, sir!
-What side was that?
-Sir, left side, sir!
-Are you sure, Private Pyle?
-Sir, yes, sir!
What side was that?
Sir, right side, sir!
Don't fuck with me again, Pyle!
Pick up your fucking cover!
Sir, yes, sir!
Tonight, you pukes will sleep
with your rifles!
You will give your rifle a girl's name!
Because this is the only pussy
you people are going to get!
Your days of finger-banging
old Mary Jane Rottencrotch...
...through her pretty
pink panties are over!
You're married to this piece...
...this weapon of iron and wood!
And you will be faithful!
HARTMAN: Prepare to mount!
Mount!
Pray!
RECRUITS:  "This is my rifle.
"There are many like it,
but this one is mine.
"My rifle is my best friend.
"It is my life.
"I must master it,
as I must master my life.
"Without me, my rifle is useless.
"Without my rifle, I am useless.
"I must fire my rifle true.
"I must shoot straighter than my enemy,
who is trying to kill me.
"I must shoot him before he shoots me.
"I will.
"Before God I swear this creed.
"My rifle and myself are defenders
of my country.
"We are the masters of our enemy.
"We are the saviors of my life.
"So be it...
"...until there is no enemy, but peace.
"Amen. "
At ease!
Good night, ladies!
HARTMAN: Hit it!
Sir, yes, sir!
Right shoulder, hut!
This is not your daddy's shotgun,
Cowboy!
Left shoulder, hut!
Move the rifle around your head,
not your head around the rifle!
Port, hut!
Four inches from your chest, Pyle!
Four inches!
"This is my rifle!
This is my gun!
RECRUITS: "This is for fighting!
This is for fun!
"This is my rifle! This is my gun!
"This is for fighting! This is for fun!"
HARTMAN: You're bouncing!
HARTMAN: Ten fucking seconds!
It should take you ten seconds
to negotiate this obstacle!
Quickly, move it out!
No swinging-dick private
in this platoon's gonna graduate...
...until they get this obstacle down
to less than ten fucking seconds!
HARTMAN: Next two! Quickly!
Get over that goddamn obstacle!
Move it!
HARTMAN: Private Joker, are you a killer?
Let me hear your war cry!
HARTMAN: Get your fat ass over there!
That's right, Private Pyle...
...don't make any fucking effort
to get up to the top!
If God wanted you up there,
He'd have miracled your ass up there!
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!
Get your fat ass up there!
What the hell's wrong with you?
If there was some pussy up there,
you could get up there, couldn't you?
Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Your ass looks like about
PYLE: Sir, yes, sir!
One for the commandant!
One for the Corps!
Get up there!
Pull!
The Corps don't get theirs!
Get up there, Pyle!
Pull!
Pull, Pyle, pull!
One pull-up, Pyle! Come on, pull!
You've got to be shitting me!
Get your ass up there!
Do you mean to tell me you cannot do
one single pull-up?
You are a worthless piece of shit, Pyle!
Get out of my face!
Get up there, Snowball.
HARTMAN: Get up here, fatboy!
Quickly! Move it up, Pyle! Move it up!
You climb obstacles like old people fuck.
Do you know that, Private Pyle?
Get up here! You're too slow! Move it!
Private Pyle, whatever you do,
don't fall down!
That would break my fucking heart!
Quickly! Up and over! Up and over!
What in the fuck are you waiting for,
Private Pyle?
Get up and over!
Move it, move it!
HARTMAN: Are you quitting on me?
Well, are you?
Then quit, you slimy, fucking,
walrus-Iooking piece of shit!
Get the fuck off of my obstacle!
Get the fuck off of my obstacle!
Now! Move it!
I'm going to rip your balls off so you
can't contaminate the rest of the world!
I will motivate you, Private Pyle...
...if it short-dicks every cannibal
on the Congo!
Pick 'em up and set 'em down, Pyle!
Quickly! Move it up!
Were you born a fat, slimy scumbag,
you piece of shit, Private Pyle?
Or did you have to work on it?
Move it up!
Quickly! Hustle up!
The fucking war will be over by the time
we get out there, Private Pyle!
HARTMAN: Are you going to fucking die?
Are you going to die on me?
Do it now!
Move it up!
Hustle it up! Quickly!
Feel dizzy?
Faint?
Jesus H. Christ,
I think you've got a hard-on!
HARTMAN: Quickly, ladies!
Assholes and elbows! Move it out!
Get up!
Reveille! Reveille!
HARTMAN:
Drop your cocks and grab your socks!
Today is Sunday! Divine worship is 0800.
Get your bunks made
and your uniforms on.
Police call in two minutes.
Private Cowboy, Private Joker.
Finish your bunks, then you two turds
clean the head.
Sir, yes, sir!
I want that head so sanitary...
...that the Virgin Mary could go
in there and take a dump!
Sir, yes, sir!
Do you believe in the Virgin Mary?
Sir, no, sir!
Private Joker, I don't believe
I heard you correctly!
Sir, the private said "No, sir," sir!
You little maggot!
You make me want to vomit!
You communist heathen, sound off
that you love the Virgin Mary...
...or I'll stomp your guts out!
You love the Virgin Mary, don't you?
Negative, sir!
-Are you trying to offend me?
-Sir, negative, sir!
Sir, the private believes that
any answer he gives will be wrong!
And that you will beat him harder
if he reverses himself, sir!
Who's your squad leader?
JOKER: The private's squad leader
is Private Snowball, sir!
Private Snowball!
Private Snowball reporting, sir!
HARTMAN: You're fired!
Private Joker is promoted to squad leader!
Sir, aye, aye, sir!
HARTMAN: Disappear, scumbag!
SNOWBALL: Sir, yes, sir!
Reporting as ordered, sir!
From now on Private Joker is your new
squad leader and you bunk with him.
He'll teach you!
-He'll teach you how to pee!
-Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN: Private Joker is ignorant
but he's got guts, and guts is enough.
Now you ladies carry on.
Sir, aye, aye, sir!
The bolt. The bolt goes in the receiver.
Operating rod handle.
Operating rod guide.
And the left one over the right.
Right one over the left.
Left one over the right.
Right one over the left.
Just throw your other leg over.
JOKER: Pull the next one over
and you're home free.
JOKER: Just throw it over.
JOKER: That'a boy. Just set it down.
JOKER: Congratulations, Leonard.
You did it.
Fold the blanket and sheet back together.
Make a four-inch fold.
Got it?
You do it.
Right shoulder, hut!
Port, hut!
Order, hut!
HARTMAN: Square these weapons away.
HARTMAN:
The deadliest weapon in the world...
...is a Marine, and his rifle.
It is your killer instinct
that must be harnessed...
...if you expect to survive in combat.
Your rifle...
...is only a tool.
It is a hard heart that kills.
If your killer instincts
are not clean and strong...
...you will hesitate
at the moment of truth.
You will not kill.
You will become dead Marines.
And then you will be in a world of shit.
Because Marines are not allowed...
...to die without permission!
HARTMAN: Do you maggots understand?
Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN:
"I love working for Uncle Sam!"
"Lets me know just who I am!
"One, two, three, four!
United States Marine Corps!
"One, two, three, four!
I love the Marine Corps!
"My Corps! Your Corps!
"Our Corps! Marine Corps!
"I don't know, but I've been told...
"...Eskimo pussy is mighty cold!
"Mmm, good! Feels good!
"Is good! Real good!
"Tastes good! Mighty good!
"Good for you! Good for me!"
HARTMAN: Trim 'em!
HARTMAN: Toe-jam!
Pop that blister!
HARTMAN: Jesus H. Christ!
Private Pyle...
-Why is your footlocker unlocked?
-Sir, I don't know, sir!
If there is one thing
in this world I hate...
...it is an unlocked footlocker!
You know that, right?
Sir, yes, sir!
Without dickheads like you,
there'd be no thievery in the world!
Sir, no, sir!
Get down!
Now let's just see
if there's anything missing!
HARTMAN: Holy Jesus!
What is that?
What the fuck is that?
What is that, Private Pyle?
-Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir!
-A jelly doughnut?
-Where did you get it?
-From the mess hall, sir!
-Is chow allowed in the barracks, Pyle?
-Sir, no, sir!
Are you allowed to eat
jelly doughnuts, Private?
Sir, no, sir!
-Why not, Private?
-Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir!
Because you are a disgusting fatbody,
Private Pyle!
Sir, yes, sir!
Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut
in your footlocker?
Because I was hungry, sir!
Because you were hungry?
Private Pyle...
...has dishonored himself
and dishonored the platoon!
I have tried to help him,
but I have failed!
I have failed because
you have not helped me!
HARTMAN: You people...
...have not given Private Pyle
the proper motivation!
From now on,
whenever Private Pyle fucks up...
...I will not punish him.
I will punish all of you!
And the way I see it, ladies...
...you owe me for one jelly doughnut!
Get on your faces!
Open your mouth!
They're paying for it, you eat it!
HARTMAN: Ready, exercise!
RECRUITS:
"One, two, three, four!
"I love the Marine Corps!"
You really look like shit today.
Joker?
Everybody hates me now.
Even you.
Nobody hates you, Leonard.
You just keep making mistakes,
getting everybody in trouble.
I can't do anything right.
I need help.
I'm trying to help you.
I'm really trying.
Tuck your shirt in.
Do it.
COWBOY:
Remember, it's just a bad dream, fatboy.
HARTMAN:
Do we love our beloved Corps, ladies?
RECRUITS:
Semper fi, do or die!
Gung ho, gung ho!
HARTMAN: What makes the grass grow?
Blood, blood, blood.
HARTMAN:
What do we do for a living, ladies?
Kill, kill, kill!
HARTMAN: I can't hear you!
Kill, kill, kill!
HARTMAN: Bullshit! I still can't hear you!
RECRUITS: Kill, kill, kill!
HARTMAN: Do any of you know
who Charles Whitman was?
None of you dumbasses knows?
Sir, he shot all those people
from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir!
Charles Whitman killed 12 people...
...from a 28-story observation tower
at the University of Texas...
...from distances of up to 400 yards.
HARTMAN: Anybody know
who Lee Harvey Oswald was?
Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir!
And do you know how far away he was?
Sir, it was far! From that
book suppository building, sir!
HARTMAN: Knock it off!
He was 250 feet away and shooting
at a moving target.
He got off three rounds...
...with an Italian bolt-action rifle
in six seconds...
...and scored two hits,
including a head shot!
Do any of you know where...
...these individuals learned to shoot?
Sir, in the Marines, sir!
In the Marines! Outstanding!
Those individuals...
...showed what one motivated Marine
and his rifle can do!
HARTMAN:
Before you ladies leave my island...
...you will all be able
to do the same thing!
"Happy birthday to you
"Happy birthday, dear Jesus"
Today...
...is Christmas!
There will be a magic show at 0930!
Chaplain Charlie will tell you...
...about how the free world
will conquer Communism...
...with the aid of God and a few Marines!
God has a hard-on for Marines...
...because we kill everything we see!
He plays His games...
...we play ours!
To show our appreciation
for so much power...
...we keep heaven packed...
...with fresh souls!
God was here before the Marine Corps!
So you can give your heart to Jesus...
...but your ass belongs to the Corps!
-Do you ladies understand?
-Sir, yes, sir!
I can't hear you!
Sir, yes, sir!
PYLE: It's been swabbed and brushed.
PYLE: Everything...
...is clean.
Beautiful.
So that it slides perfectly.
Nice.
PYLE: Everything cleaned...
...oiled.
So that your action is beautiful.
Smooth, Charlene.
Leonard talks to his rifle.
I don't think Leonard can hack it anymore.
I think Leonard's a Section 8.
COWBOY: It don't surprise me.
JOKER: I want to slip my tubesteak
into your sister.
JOKER: What will you take in trade?
COWBOY: What do you got?
Outstanding!
We've finally found something you do well!
Sir, yes, sir!
What is your 6th general order?
Sir, to receive, obey and pass on
to the sentry who relieves me...
...all orders...
Sir, the 6th general...
The private does not know, sir!
You slimy scumbag,
get down and give me 25!
Sir, aye, aye, sir!
How many counts in that movement?
Sir, four, sir!
HARTMAN:
Why look down in the chamber?
Sir, to be sure the inspecting officer
is not given a loaded weapon, sir!
What's your 5th general order?
Sir, to quit my post
only when properly relieved, sir!
HARTMAN: What's this weapon's name?
Sir, the private's weapon's name
is Charlene, sir!
HARTMAN:
Private, you are definitely born again hard.
I may even let you serve as a rifleman
in my beloved Corps.
Sir, yes, sir!
HARTMAN:
"I don't want no teenage queen!"
"I just want my M-14!
"If I die in the combat zone
"Box me up and ship me home!
"Pin my medals upon my chest!
"Tell my mom I've done my best!"
JOKER:
Graduation is only a few days away...
...and the recruits of Platoon 3092
are salty.
They are ready to eat their own guts
and ask for seconds.
The instructors are proud to see us
growing beyond their control.
JOKER:
The Marine Corps does not want robots.
The Marine Corps wants killers.
The Marine Corps wants to build
indestructible men.
Men without fear.
