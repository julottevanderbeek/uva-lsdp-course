Former military experience:
You must understand, without
putting too fine a point on it,
that the army here is
in a total shambles.
I've got half my company missing.
I just can't find them.
They've gone off somewhere to sleep.
why exactly are Mr Sheridan,
Sir John MacDonald and Mr O'Sullivan
handling the administration
of your army?
Because I chose them.
I consider those gentlemen to be
utterly trustworthy and competent.
The first thing my men will find
when they do awake
is the enemy on them,
cutting their throats.

Alexander MacDonald,

is to fight with him as clan warriors
This is the system
of the Highland clan: human rent.
I hold my land from MacCruachan,
as my father did,
by bringing him 20 fighting men
from amongst my tenants.
These I have brought.
To this man, who is rent,
today's battle is a matter of honour.
I fight today because it is an honour
to be with my chief, MacDhomhnuill,
and because my father
fought beside his father.
To this man, who is rem,
the battle is a matter of revenge.
I fight first for MacDhomhnuill,
then for Charlie.
Then because the Campbells,
who did steal my cows,
are with the enemy.
I have also raised
over 100 men from Rannoch.
Some were unwilling.
With these, I used force.

almost reached London
but that also twice reduced

Blunt, imperious, this man has
bitterly quarreled with Charles
over the chaos
in the army administration
and over the choice
of this battlefield,
ideal for the employment
by the British army
And from behind the shelter
of these walls,
which O'Sullivan
has refused to pull down,
Lord George Murray also fears
both crossfire and outflanking.
in view of what Lord George
feels about the battlefield,
have you inspected
the ground yourself?
- No, I have not.
- Why not?
Because I don't deem it necessary.
It is a large, plain moor
and, as such, it's a fair field
for the enemy horse and cannon
against which the
Highlanders will be defenceless.
I have informed His Royal Highness
that it is a good field
which I believe it to be.
I have told the Prince
I do not like it.
Your Highness,
why are you fighting today,
when the ground here has been
criticized by some of your officers?
Because God is on our side
and I am convinced that my duty
to my people lies in fighting today.
It's my opinion that the choice
of the field for us is suicidal.

It will be a fine thing

then we could get back

Half the ammunition's with the food.
That's still back in Inverness.
I haven't eaten for...
I don't know how long.
Ah, well now... that really
is not my responsibility.
But, Mr O'Sullivan, you are
the quartermaster general
and, as such, surely you're responsible
for the distribution of food.
In normal circumstances, yes
but now, as I am much pressed

I have given that responsibility

Andrew Henderson, Whig historian,
biographer of Cumberland,
The time is 12:15.
Now this wall,
behind which we're sheltering,
is at approximately right angles
to the rebel lines.
I've drawn a rough sketch map here.
The rebel lines are here.
We are here.
And the Duke of Cumberland's army
is here.
a total of 1,300 regular soldiers
from the Lowlands,
plus, in reserve,
the volunteer militias
of Stirling, Edinburgh,
Dumfries and Glasgow,
regent claimant to the thrones
of England and Scotland,
has more Scots-in-arms
against him than for him.
And, ranged against him
in the Highlands,
he has the Whig clans
siding with the Government,
the Munros, the Rosses,
the MacKenzies,
and here on the moor,
the Campbells of the Argyll militia.
Here to fight Charles and his
rebellion, here to take clan revenge,
Alistair MacDonald, brother
killed by Campbells in a cattle raid.
For him, loyalties to Charlie
mean little.
For him,
today's battle is a clan battle.
The swords those bastards use
can cut a man in half.
Well, I reckon
we'll have them this time.
- Why do you say that?
- We've got a new bayonet drill, see.
You don't poke
at the man in front of you.
You poke at the man
coming at your chum on the right.
That means,
as he's lifting his sword arm,
you get him underneath, like.
Well... I ain't taken me clothes off
for six weeks.
I reckon till we lay
them bastards out I won't, neither.
I'll tell you one thing.
I know a lot of the boys
make fun of our Billy Cumberland
but I reckon he's all right.
He's a tough bastard
but at least he feeds you
which is more than some of them do.
I've heard said the rebels want to cut
him as small as herbs for the pot.
Well... I don't reckon that.
They're a lot of friggin' savages.
forced a month ago
into the Highland army,

twice has been captured
and forced to return.
forced into the Highland army
the day before yesterday.
With him his son,
John Angus MacDonald,
I can't just make out
what's happening in the rebel lines.
There's much confusion of movement.
Large numbers of men are moving about,
changing their position...
and there are large gaps
in the centre.
It seems to me as though
the entire line is completely askew.
We are all MacDonalds and, as such,
we are entitled to stand
on the right in the line of battle.
This is an ancient
MacDonald privilege
and yet Mr O'Sullivan
has thought fit to place
Lord George Murray's men
in that position.
The main reason is that
yesterday the Prince had an idea
for a surprise march by night
on the camp of Cumberland.
This we attempted. It failed.
But it meant that we were
all up marching the entire night.
Consequently, the men are exhausted
and are still stumbling
into their positions.
What effect has this had
on your men?
Look at them.
As far as I am concerned,
we are now putting an end
to a bad affair.
The Scots are fair fighters
until a crisis is reached
and it's my opinion
we've now reached that crisis.
With all these things amiss
in our army,
it would have been better had the
Prince made some plan for retreat.
Bu! Charles
has made no plans for retreat.
He says that only those who are
afraid can doubt his coming victory.
He puts from his mind
the discontent of the MacDonalds,
convinced as he is
of the invincibility of his men.
God is on our side.
Our cause is just
and we will triumph this day.
The soldiers in the Elector's army
know me to be their lawful Prince.
And so I'm convinced
they'll break in panic,
for they will never dare fight me.
Battalion, fix your bayonets.
Fix.
This man's name is Chisholm,
James Chisholm.

The Chisholm 500 yards away

Charles Edward Stuart's war
is a civil war.
They've started.
The rebel cannon have opened fire.
The cannon have opened
from the rebels' centre
and they're over-elevated.
Fire!
Batteries...
from open sights...
at will... fire!
Pull!
Fire!
Fire!
That's the Duke of Cumberland's
cannons.
Cannonades all around me!
I'm going to have to shout
to make myself heard!
The smoke
is beginning to thicken.
It's going to be very difficult
to see what effect our cannon
is having on the rebel lines.
A cast-iron ball of three pounds'
weight, fired from open sights.
This is roundshot.
This is what it does.
Pull!
Alistair McInnes, age 20.
Right leg severed below knee joint.
Malcolm Angus Chisholm, age 24.
Disembowelled.
Dazed, indecisive, Charles
has moved to behind
and is now unable to see
what is happening to his army.
Ordered by O'Sullivan
to stand in the ranks six-deep,
make a clear and tight-packed target
for the English gunners.
Pull!
The rebels' artillery
have stopped firing altogether
and, before they did, we counted...
How many?
We counted 15 to 20 shots
fired by our artillery
for every one fired by the rebels.
The second result of
O'Sullivan's administration.
The Prince's artillery, iii-fed
by a sporadic ammunition supply,
Pull!
- No, I've had none!
- Well, why not?
The Prince hasn't given any!
If he doesn't give them soon,
he'll lose the entire army!
We're being shelled to pieces!
Pull!
Reload!
Pull!
Reload!
- What's the Prince
- I don't know!
Nobody knows what he's doing!
1:22. Prince Charles Stuart,
paralyzed with indecision,
still has given no order,
either to advance or to retreat.
1:22. Clan Cameron,
Clan Stewart,
This is fantastic!
If this keeps up much longer,
our gunners will have
finished the whole affair.
The cannonade... The cannonade
has given our men infinite spirits.
Clan Chisholm casualties,
This is incredible! Those men have
been standing there for 22 minutes!
They're just lining the ranks!
The rebels are being
literally blown apart!
Why are they standing there?
Why in God's name don't they run?
Clan army casualties,
Charles Stuart hopes
that by not advancing
he will tempt the Government army
out of its battle lines to attack him.
but not the one
his cousin is expecting.
I want Wolfe's battalion
to advance inside on the left!
Your Highness!
behind one of the walls
O'Sullivan has refused to pull down,
to fire into the side
of the clan army
when it charges
the Government front.
This is the crossfire
O'Sullivan said would never happen.
Oh, yes, yes... Units of the Argyll...
the Campbell-Argyll militia, yes?
And there are squadrons
of dragoons with them.
Yes, it's obvious that
His Royal Highness has decided
to have units of the Campbell-Argyll
militia and some squadrons of dragoons
to go down behind
the south side of this wall,
out of sight of the enemy,
to take them in the rear
and outflank the rebels.
that O'Sullivan
said would never happen.
29 minutes too late,
Charles Stuart orders an advance
along the entire from
of the Jacobite army.
And you make the right side advance!
Bu! The message
fails to reach the right wing.
Have you still had
no orders to attack?
No! I've had no orders!
I had a message from Mr O'Sullivan,
which, as ever,
I failed to comprehend!
- The line's broken up!
- What?
They're charging,
they're coming straight at us!
Sir, the right has broken forward!
The walls will hold them.
- They're going straight!
- Get down behing the wall there!
After 28 minutes of cannonfire!
What sort of men are these?
- Right! Change from ball to grape.
- Change from ball to grape!
A cylindrical canvas bag
eight inches in length,
packed with musketballs
and pieces of jagged iron.
This is grapeshot.
This is what it does.
Pull!
Pull!
It must be the grape! The centre
has collided with the right.
There's great confusion,
bodies flying!
They must be going to receive fire
from our centre battalions!
Charge! Charge!
Fire!
Bastards!
God, they're almost upon us!
They're firing from this side
and from this side.
They're been cut to pieces!
It must be chaos behind those walls!
Chaos!
Barrell's!
Towards this one regiment,
Barrell's Fourth of Foot,
heads the entire right
of the clan army,
running with a collision speed
of over 12 miles an hour.
Alternate... firing!
Battalion, take care.
Fall in by rank. Take aim!
Rear rank, present!
Rear rank, fire!
Fire!
Front rank, take aim!
Front rank, fire!
Rear rank, present.
Fire!
Centre rank, present.
Front rank, present.
Remember, Barrell's,
off to the right!
They've broken through Barrell's!
General Huske, advance Bligh's
and Semphill's, support on the left.
Your Highness.
1:57 and the Duke of Cumberland
sees the men of his second line,
placed there for just such an
emergency, fire with crippling effect
into the Highlanders
who broke through the from line.
1:57. Charles Stuart,
who has made no battle plan at all,
sees, on the right wing, his men run
from this concentrated musketfire
rebellious at not being given their
rightful battle position by O'Sullivan,
hold back from charging
the royal army right.
trying to tempt the royal army lines
forward in disorder.
Battalion Pulteney's, make ready!
They're stopping to pick up stones!
Shoot!
1:58. The MacDonalds, dismayed at
the sight of the advancing cavalry,
runs forward with other clan officers
to encourage them
and is shot through twice
by musketball.
Christ, they're running.
They're leaving the field
except for two small units,
the French and the Irish.
Let them through. Stand your ground.
Guard, forward!
Oh, Jesus!
Front rank, present. Fire!
Re-form! Re-form!
Stand and aim! Fire!
Walter Stapleton,
commander, Irish pickets,
Where are you going, you?
Charles Stuart
tries to rally his men.
"Pray stand with me, your Prince,"
he cries.
"Pray stand with me but a moment,
otherwise you ruin me,
"your country and yourselves
and God forgive you.“".
At one minute past two
in the afternoon,
Charles Edward Stuart
is led from the battlefield
by the man most responsible
for his defeat.
As Charles leaves, a senior
clan officer screams after him,
"
- Mr Fossett.
- Your Highness?
- You will order a general ceasefire.
- Your Highness.
who advanced this morning from Naim
with Private Laing,
Bu! For every one corpse
in the royal army
including the brother
of Private James Chisholm.
There was scarce a soldier or officer
of Barrell's Fourth of Foot
who did not kill one or two men each
with their bayonets or spontoons.
Not a bayonet but was bent
and stained with blood
All witnesses agreed that, if
grapeshot were the king of battles,
the bayonet was now
the queen of weapons.
"It is mine and everybody': opinion,"
boasts a trooper,
"that no history can brag
of so singular"
Don't feel nothing, really.
I feel all right!
Well, now it's over.
Battalion, take care!
Halt!
2:14pm. The battalions
of Cumberland
halt at the lines held by the rebels
one hour and eight minutes ago.
Battalion, shoulder your firelocks!
Three cheers for His Royal Highness!
- Hip, hip!
- Hurrah!
Thus has ended the last battle
to be fought in Britain
and the last armed attempt
to overthrow its king.
The Establishment has been saved,
peace restored,
Church, Crown,
trade and commerce safeguarded.
Thus the Duke of Cumberland
won his only victory
His advisers are shortly to urge
his instructions for reassembly.
"He is to reply, " Do as you wish.
Only, for God's sake, let us go.“
Charles Edward Stuart,
his cause now in ruins,
Charles pitted these men against
the modem musket and bayonet,
he has reduced
the ﬂower of the Highland clans
2:30 pm and His Royal Highness,
the Duke of Cumberland,
orders rum and brandy, cheese
and biscuits for his “brave boys.“
For the wounded and dying clansmen
on the moor,
All over the battlefield, whilst the
Duke of Cumberland eats his lunch,
is either slit in the throat,
pistolled through the head
or bayonetted and trampled on
until, in the words of an eyewitness,
"and our British soldiers
looked less like Christian men"
What about some grub?
This rebel host has been
most deeply indebted to the public
for all the rapine,
murder and cruelty
and our men are heartily determined
to give them receipt in full.
Cut him!
Cut him, you bastard!
Take him to the shoulder!
I'm letting my regiments of horse
loose after the battle
in order they may have some sweets
with all their fatigue.
Thus nearly 100 people
are to be butchered or maimed
Butchered whether or not
they took any part in the battle.
They took my baby.
He's only two weeks old.
And one of them
whirled him around by his leg...
and threw him on to the ground.
Cut about the face and body
by sabres,
she was left lying for dead
on the road to Inverness.
The soldiers came in and caught him,
and Daddy too
but I got away
through a hole in the wall.
- How old was your brother?
- Lachlan was nine.
I don't... I don't know
where he and Daddy are now.
Come on, you!
James Rae: trooper,
Kingston's Light Horse,
the first man of Cumberland': army
to enter the Highland capital,
what is to be expected
from an Englishman
protecting his liberty
and his Protestant religion.
There was these two men,
shouting and screaming.
And then he came out
and there was blood on his hands.
These troopers from the Duke
of Kingston's Light Horse Regiment
are later to be commended
by Cumberland
James Rae himself, who, like the other
troopers of Kingston's Light Horse,
played his pan in the battle
when it was over,
where his regimental colours
are to be laid to rest
"To the perpetual fame
and immortal memory
"of the Duke of Kingston's
Light Horse,
"where, amongst others,
on the 16th day of April 1746,
"they performed
many and glorious exploits
"in routing and entirely subduing
the perfidious rebels.“".
"Long may
the county of Nottingham ﬂourish."
For William Augustus,
Duke of Cumberland,
an evening of immense
satisfaction and triumph.
At the age of 25,
he has saved his father's kingdom
and redeemed the reputation
of the British army.
At his table, older officers drink
his toast and declare him to be
one of the greatest English captains
since Marlborough.
His cousin Charles, until today the
heroic leader of an armed rebellion,
If further proof were needed
of this young man's prowess,
unheeded by him,
four and a half miles away.
This is Lachlan MacDonald
of Lochaber,

below the knee joint.
He's been lying on the moor
untended for 13 hours.
For most of the time,
it has been raining.
This is Mrs Anne Hossack
of Inverness.
Somewhere on the moor,
amidst 1,200 dead and dying,
I don't know...
where he is.
For Alexander Laing, private,
Barrell's Fourth Regiment of Foot,
this evening is also
one of immense satisfaction.
His regiment has acquitted itself
with honour on the field of battle.
He himself has despatched
three of the rebels
and, above all, he himself
has escaped death and maiming.
Lucky bastard!
Battalion will take care
while the casualty lists are read.
It's all right for you, my lord!
wife of Private Andrew Walker, who
was wounded in the ranks of Barrell's
This woman, also, has no idea
whether her husband is alive or dead.
It is given out this morning
of Thursday 17th April
that the following officers
and other ranks
of Major General William Barrell's
Regiment of Foot
were either killed
or have since died from wounds
resulting from the glorious victory
inflicted yesterday
over the rebel army.
Killed: Captain Lord Robert Kerr.
Other ranks: Sergeant Pullman,
Privates Baker, Barstow, Dyke,
Finch, Lowell,
Lawson, Meecham, Napper, Osbourne,
Smart, Williamson.
Wounded and since died
in the surgeons' lines:
Corporal Lockhart,
Privates Davis, Pollock and Walker.
Battalion, take care.
Battalion will dismiss,
save for the duty picket.
Battalion, dismiss.
You treated Private Walker
a short while ago, Doctor?
Yes... Yes, I did.
This one? He died of shock,
if I remember correctly.
Why was that?
He was an amputee.
I had to take his arm off.
Do you know what...
what is our young Billy's pleasure
because we fought
with such gallantry?
His Royal Highness thanks
all ye officers and men
for their gallant behaviour.
Get out of it! Leave off!
His Royal Highness releases
all ye military prisoners
who were this day
in custody of the provost.
- Have you heard about the wounded?
- Well, yeh, some talk about it.
They're gonna pay 12 guineas
out of the Duke's own purse
for all those wounded in the battle.
who's been now lying on the moor
two days with a severed right leg,
"A captain and 40 foot
to march directly"
"in the neighbourhood
of the field of battle."
"The officers and men
will take notice"
"that the public order of the rebels
on the day of battle"
Line up the bodies, men.
Come on, quick as you can.
There's another one over there.
The public orders of the rebels
to give no mercy to the royal army
do not exist in any other form
than a crude forgery
alleged to have been found
on the field of battle.
All right, lad.
We're only taking you to hospital.
Bu! Whether he knows this
public order is a forgery or not,
Cumberland makes it his excuse
to authorize what now happens.
Battalion, present your firelock...
at the man in front of you.
Fire!
The officer in charge
of this execution squad
Captain Scott, are many of the rebels
being killed in this fashion?
As many as we can find.
I don't know how many men
have been killed in this fashion.
I fear to think.
But just this morning I heard
a Campbell officer saying that,
in just one area, he himself
saw 72 wounded rebels
shot or clubbed on the head.
Yes, I saw what was done.
No, of course I didn't.
I will always thank God that I had
nothing to do with the black work.
You must try to remember that
this is a most difficult problem.
I have talked much with officers
from Lowland Scots regiments
and they undoubtedly feel
that these Highlanders
are threatening their culture,
their Protestant religion.
They're threatening to disrupt
their peace and their commerce.
There's a great feeling of insecurity
in the Lowlands.
These people still remember
the Highland host.
They still remember the years
of cattle thieves and murder,
men coming down at night
from the hills
and extorting blackmail
under pain of being robbed.
You see, the Highlander
talks a different language.
He wears different clothes...
and he undoubtedly has
some uncouth and barbaric practices.
For all these reasons,
I think you'll find most Lowlanders
hold the man
from this part of the country
in contempt and hatred.
Much more so
even than the English do.
Why is your army treating the
prisoners and the wounded like this?
Of yourself, it's been said you're
keeping the prisoners in Inverness
And that you're even withholding
medical dressings from them.
Surely this is against
all bounds of humanity.
Look, I think the point
somewhat eludes you.
These men are rebels and barbarians
and as such are to be rated as cattle
and treated as cattle.
Get that thing
back out the way, please.
For three days and nights
since the battle,

Patrol of Bligh's,
you will proceed on police action
to Lochaber,
with sufficient rations for two days.
All right, lads. Fall out
and pick up your firelocks.
Move it!
Lord Sackville, what is the function
of these patrols.
Their function is to march
deep into the glens
occupied by the rebels
and their families
and there, by vigorous police action,
ensure that never again will these
people disturb the peace of our land.
May 30th. A military patrol

I dunno, they looked like ordinary

Look, let me tell you something.
I had a mate at Falkirk.
He had his head split open.
Like that.
So don't try and make me

Well satisfied with the result
of his military occupation,
Cumberland is to leave
Scotland on July 18th.
He leaves behind him, to finish
the destruction of the rebel clans,
not only an immense concentration
of English and Lowland troops,
not only the zealous help
of all the Whig clans,
but even the help of the chief
of a rebel clan, Ludovick Grant,
who has hastily
reorganized his loyalties
and just delivered 82 of his own
rebel clansmen to Cumberland
as proof of his unswerving allegiance
to the Crown.
Cumberland himself is to receive
from London a tumultuous welcome.

Month after month,
the British army patrols
scour every hill range and glen
of northern Scotland
"to wear down this generation

The patrols leave behind them
a trail of brutality and suffering
that is to earn for their commander
undying loathing
and the epithet
Cumberland the Butcher.

We have detachments

The people are deservedly

but for the English Government,
this was just the beginning.
Systematically and with
clue parliamentary legislation,
they proceeded to eliminate ail
the things that made this man unique
and that gave him
the strength they so feared.
They penalized the wearing

penalized the weaving
of his Highland tartan,
penalized the worshipping
at his Church,
penalized the carrying
of his weapons,
They removed
the authority of his chief
and, in one blow, smashed forever
the system of his clan.
They then encouraged his chief
to lose interest in him,
to evict him and to replace him
by the more profitable sheep.
Thus they reduced him
