Widersta_dskämpfer im Wald.
Feuer.
Hardly touched us.
- Bring my gloves, will you, Evans?
- Right you are, man.
Greiner, make a note of that flak tower.
- Well done, Digger.
- Yes, it's not bad, is it?
Got a light, old boy?
That, er, Jerry ammunition truck
made a pretty tempting target.
So did you when you broke formation.
How did l know
l was going to run into a flak tower?
- You know what l'll do, Gillibrand?
- No, sir.
l'm gonna recommend you for a medal.
Thanks very much, skipper.
l appreciate that.
When it comes,
l'm gonna pin it right on your tail.
Roy, what are you gonna do
on your leave?
- l'm gonna sleep for three days.
- Who with?
Me, l'm headin' right for Hyde Park.
- l thought ducks were out of season.
- Not the kind of birds l'm after.
- How about you, Scott?
- l'm going where there's no aircraft.
Group Captain Barratt wants to see you.
He says it's urgent.
Scott, take care of the debriefing.
What's up?
Thank you.
- Hello, Roy.
- Don.
- What's happening?
- We've got visitors.
- Sir.
- Come in, Barratt.
This is Wing Commander Grant
and Squadron Leader Adams.
Air Vice Marshall Davis.
Lieutenant Bergman.
- Glad to meet you, Grant.
- How do you do, sir?
Sit down, gentlemen.
Congratulations, Grant. l hear
today's operation was a great success.
- Well, we all got back, sir.
- Good.
Anyway, there'll be no more operations
for your squadron for the next 17 days.
- You mean we're on leave, sir?
- No, l don't.
All leave is cancelled until further orders.
an urgent, most secret operation.
Your men are going into training for it,
and that's all they need know.
- Do you mind if l ask a question?
- Yes?
- Why our squadron?
- What do you mean?
Some men have been on 1 2 strikes
in the last two weeks. They're pretty tired.
- They were looking forward to a leave.
- They'll have to wait.
All leave is cancelled.
Since you took over, your squadron
has attained high efficiency.
You can look upon this assignment
as a reward.
l'll try to, sir.
Now, for the operation.
As you know, the Germans have been
building mysterious concrete blocks
all up and down France and Belgium.
At last, Intelligence have come
up with the answer to what they are.
They're rocket-launching pads.
Yes, the Huns have got
a new operational rocket.
D-day is imminent.
These rockets could smash the invasion.
And they're ready by the thousand.
Why don't they use them? Fuel.
Without very special fuel,
these rockets would be so much scrap.
Now we come to why
Lieutenant Bergman is here.
He's one of the leaders
of the Norwegian Linge, the Resistance.
They have discovered the location of
the only factory the Nazis have at present
which can make fuel for these rockets.
lt's at a fiord iust north of Bergen.
Here's Bergen. Here's the fjord. It's called
the Svar_jord, the Black Water Fjord.
Now, as to the exact location
of the factory,
l'll let Lieutenant Bergman tell you.
First, l must explain
that the factory itself is not the target.
- It's not the target?
- No, the factory is bombproof.
lt is also sheltered by a huge cliff.
- Then what do we bomb?
- You bomb the mountain.
You blow away the whole overhanging
cliff so that it buries the factory.
l should explain
why you cannot bomb from above.
The Underground asked geologists
to study this mountain.
There is a fissure under the overhang.
lf you explode from below the entire
cliff will come down, or so we hope.
The only way you can get into position
is to fly up the fjord at about 200 feet.
The Huns have flak posts
at the mouth of the fjord.
At 200 feet, you'll be blown to hell,
which brings me back to Bergman.
At an exact hour on M-day,
the day of our mission,
Bergman and his men
will neutralise the enemy flak posts.
lf all goes well, Grant,
you should have a clear run up the fjord.
''lf all goes well.''
The factory will be
shipping fuel in 18 days.
Your special bombs will be ready in 17.
Today is M minus 17.
Your orders are to obliterate the target,
at whatever cost.
Any questions?
Lieutenant Bergman will work closely
with you. He knows the target well.
- What are we gonna practise on?
- We found a valley in Scotland.
lt's not nearly as tough as the fjord
but it's the best we can do.
- Barratt.
- Sir?
This gives you exact schedules
and routes to the training site.
Training to commence immediately.
l think that's all, gentlemen.
Oh, Adams. Will you see that Lieutenant
Bergman finds suitable quarters?
l certainly will, sir.
- Nice to have you with us, Lieutenant.
- Thank you very much.
Wing Commander.
l just wanted to tell you how pleased
l am they chose you for this operation.
l'm glad you are. l wish l felt the same.
You give the impression of
being able to do difficult things.
- l do what they tell me to do.
- But this is terribly important.
That's what they always say.
- You sound so cynical.
- Do l?
- You've not seen the Nazis at close range.
- Close enough.
ln the air, yes.
But l've seen them in my country,
torturing and killing innocent people.
- You wanna bury them under a mountain.
- Yes. If it will help win the war.
lf we're working together,
we might as well understand each other.
We'll do the best job we can,
but as far as l'm concerned, it's a job -
not the Holy Grail, OK?
- l will try to remember that.
- You do that.
- Climb in. l'll drive you to your quarters.
- Thank you.
X marks the spot.
Our climb is slow.
We'll have to increase
our approach speed to 290.
How are we gonna bomb the target
even if we get the right approach speed?
That's what we're here to find out.
Made eight passes already
and each one's a bust.
Skipper, iust let's sit this one out, eh?
Don't you trust me, Hoppy?
Like my dear old mum,
but this one's a bit dicey.
l thought you wanted to see Scotland.
Yeah, but not upside down.
You had a good day, Grant.
Not good enough.
l'll try it again tomorrow.
That's yesterday, today, tomorrow.
That's three days out of your 17.
- Perhaps you better take the squadron.
- All right.
l wish there was some way
to see that target.
l could describe it to you. Every detail.
Hey, wasn't Bissel an artist?
The centre peak is higher.
- This one?
- Yes. And the cliff hangs over more.
- Fine.
- What's this all about, skipper?
- You'll find out soon enough.
l see. Sort of hush-hush.
Well, you're sure that's the way it is?
l mean, as you remember it?
- Yes, that's as good as a photograph.
- Thanks, Bissel.
Bissel. How you makin' out
with Mary whatshername?
Mary Blake?
Well, it's sort of hush-hush
but... we're going to get married.
He's out of his head.
- Don't you approve of war marriages?
- No, not for me.
- You don't want any attachments?
- That's right.
How wide is that fiord at that point?
Not over 200 yards.
What's on the other side of the fiord?
A lake. A large lake.
- What's that?
- A sailboat.
My sister Hilde and l
used to go sailing there.
She's in England now.
How did she get out of Norway?
We smuggled her out in a fishing boat,
just after our parents were killed.
- And your parents, Roy. Where are they?
- My parents?
My mother's dead. l haven't seen
my father since l was a kid.
Well, l have been more fortunate.
At least my memories before the war
were happy ones.
What did you do before the war?
l was studying to become a doctor
until the Nazis came.
lnstead of learning how to cure,
we learnt how to kill.
l will send word.
With all these reinforcements,
will they call off the attack?
No, not if Erik can help it.
There are many more Germans.
We'll spread ourselves thinner
and start 24-hour patrols.
Thanks.
Stand easy, gentlemen.
l summoned you because
l've had a message from Intelligence.
The Germans have moved in
another regiment
and a string of ack-ack vehicles
a mile long, right into our target area.
We cannot knock out another German
regiment. We have not enough men.
- You'll have to get some more.
- They will need training.
What about a parachute attack?
There is no place for them
to land or to group.
Commandos, then. There must be
some way they can get into the fjord.
There is no way. We have
discarded that idea a dozen times.
You'll have to send in more men,
whether they're trained or not.
- Could we have more time?
- There is no more time. M-day stands.
Well. In that case,
we will do the best we can.
- Well, Grant?
- l didn't say anything, sir.
No, but l could hear you thinking.
Under the new circumstances,
are you willing to go in?
- Are you asking me to volunteer?
- No, damn it. l'm not.
- l'm giving you an order.
- In that case, l volunteer.
- How did we do?
- Perfect.
l wish it had been
the Germans down there.
Try and match that.
Speed 295, dead on.
Altitude 200 feet and keep it low.
Peel o_ in this order:
Scott.
Gillibra_d. Si_gh.
l don't know why you left that coal mine.
That's what l could do with now -
a nice, deep, cosy coal mine.
lf l make a mess of this,
you'll be deeper than any coal mine.
Scott, peel!
Gillibra_d, peel!
Sta_d by, Si_gh... peel!
Now!
You fool!
You bloody Australian fool! l'm getting
married. Try and remember that.
How can l forget? l thought
l'd get the widow for myself.
l love your raw colonial humour.
Bloody Aborigines!
- Too close, Gillibrand. Pull up sooner.
- OK, skipper!
- Do you think they'll ever get it?
- Give 'em a week.
Hey, look!
This way!
- Thanks.
- What?
- You saved my neck.
- Well, why shouldn't l?
You're damn lucky they didn't get you.
Look out.
Listen. There l was, with this
Messerschmitt coming in at 1 2 o'clock.
- l was out of ammunition.
- What did you do then?
l opened the escape hatch, reached up,
grabbed him by the tail
and pulled him down.
Ah!
- Now, there's a really beautiful sight.
- Haven't you seen legs before, you ape?
- Not like yours.
- What's the matter with you Aussies?
Don't they let you see girls
till you're over 40?
- They don't have girls down under.
- Down under what?
Here comes Rosie!
- l'll ask you to step aside, sir.
- l'll step aside if you'll step outside.
We'll live in Australia
and raise kangaroos.
- Don't listen to him. Marry me.
- Belt him.
- You wouldn't hit a lad with one hand.
- It all depends what he's doing with it.
- Come on, Rosie. l will see you through.
- A gentleman at last.
Here we are.
Keep you hale and hearty till you're 90.
- That's our aim, Rosie.
- Hale and hearty till we're 90.
What are those special bombs for?
Not what. Who.
l got it straight from the adjutant's Waaf.
- They're for the Paperhanger.
- Berchtesgaden? Wow!
One of these bullets
clipped me right on the hand.
This medic said
''Shall l take you to the infirmary?''
l said ''No, but you can drop
this off at the garage.''
G___!
- That's for me. Just my type.
- Why do you think you'll get first crack?
Rank, old boy. Excuse me.
l wonder if l might entice you
into joining me for a drink?
Erik!
Three years.
Sometimes l was so afraid
that l might never see you again.
- You know me better than that.
- Of course.
Now, let me have a look at you.
What a fine uniform. The Navy, isn't it?
Yes. Unfortunately a navy without ships.
l don't care. As long as
you're safe here and not in Norway.
l think, uh... l think we've broken up
the party. Let's go into the parlour.
l have so many questions
l don't know where to start.
- Some chaps have all the luck.
- Don't be silly. That's Lt Bergman's sister.
l've got a sister.
Would you like to see a photograph?
What use is a photograph?
Anyway, she probably looks like you.
Hey! Same again, Mr Kearns!
This round's on my sister, eh?
Hey, Rosie, how about some music?!
Who's next, then?
Oh! Welcome aboard, skipper!
Sit right here!
- What are you drinking?
- Whisky?
That's what we're drinking.
Girls, how'd you manage
to break out of the barracks?
- Roy brought a ladder.
- A little second-storey work.
You've arrived just in time
to make your party complete.
- Here's to girls.
- All of 'em.
- l haven't met all of 'em.
- You haven't met Bergman's sister.
- She's in the other room.
- Here's to one l haven't met.
- Go on.
- That is about all there is.
- That is how l got to England.
- Now you work for the English?
Yes. With an RAF squadron
as liaison officer,
but that's all l'm permitted to tell you.
But enough about me. What about you?
l have been working in the country
with children who have been
sent out of the bombed areas.
Oh, Roy. Come in.
l would like you to meet my sister, Hilde.
- Wing Commander Grant.
- How do you do?
- l was just drinking a toast to you.
- Thank you.
My brother has just
been telling me about you.
- You're the girl in the sailboat.
- Sailboat?
l was telling Roy about the times we went
sailing on our lake. You remember.
Oh, yes. l remember.
But l felt much younger then.
The last three years
seemed more like 300.
- You're a mighty pretty old lady.
- Thank you again.
You don't have to pay me compliments.
Just take care of my brother.
We take care of each other.
Kind of mutual-aid society.
- Roy, your drink's getting warm.
- Oh, yeah.
- Excuse me. l was just looking for you.
- l bet you were!
ls, uh... that his fiancée?
He would be amused to hear that. No,
l don't think he takes her too seriously.
Well, l feel he doesn't take
anything seriously.
But they're all like that. Different from us.
The more they feel something,
the less they show it.
Today in that raid, some of their friends
were killed and tonight they're drinking.
And you feel that he's dependable for...
whatever it is you're doing?
Oh, yes. Completely.
Morning.
Good hit, Gillibrand.
Roger. Out, skip.
Now!
Blue Leader to Jones.
You're up. Clobber it.
OK, skipper!
What went wrong?
Their luck ran out.
Blue Leader to squadron.
Form on Scott. Return to station.
tome in.
Sorry to disturb you, Roy.
l wanted to speak to you.
tome on in.
What's up?
- l've come to say goodbye.
- Goodbye?
Yes. Davis had word
from the Underground.
They have not been able to raise enough
men. They're dropping me in tonight.
How are you gonna get more men
if there aren't any?
There is a unit operating in
the mountains, just north of the fjord.
- l might be able to bring them down.
- If you can get by the German lines.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- Hello, this is Grant. Get me Operations.
- Hold o_.
- l'll fly you in.
- They've already assigned a Mitchell.
l'll fly the drop.
Hello, Jerry? Get my ship on the line.
l'm making a drop tonight.
Right.
- You should not take unnecessary risks.
- Look who's talking.
l would like to see Hilde before l go.
All right. We'll pick her up
after l talk to Davis.
We'd planned on going to the party
tonight, the one for Bissel and Mary.
Oh, yeah. They're getting
married, aren't they?
lt's funny. Two die, two get married.
Kind of evens things up.
l thought you were against marriage.
l'm also against death...
but it happens, anyway.
l'd feel better if l could fly him there, sir.
l've ordered a Mitchell to fly him
in and make an arms drop.
- Could l fly the Mitchell?
- You're grounded until M-day.
- When did that happen?
- l've just made the decision.
Scott can lead the practice flights.
- What kind of a decision is that?
- You're too important to risk.
Yes, sir.
ls it all right if l drive him
to the airplane or is that too great a risk?
We'll take a chance on that.
Thank you, sir.
When the war is over,
we can take Roy sailing on our lake.
- Will you come, Roy?
- Sure, l'll come.
And we can go fishing, like before.
- You like to fish?
- Yeah, l like to fish.
Good. That will be something
to look forward to, eh, Hilde?
Hilde.
Adj$ da, Hilde.
Adi$ da, Erik.
- Take good care of her, Roy.
- Good luck when you hit that ground.
And to you, in the air.
All right.
Are you angry with me?
- Why should l be angry?
- You just don't seem to be friendly.
Hell, l'm friendly.
l just got a lot on my mind.
And now you've got me, besides.
Is that what you were thinking?
No.
l promise l won't be a bother,
but... one favour l have to ask you.
Let me know if there
is some news about Erik.
Sure. Give me your address
and l'll let you know.
l'm going to stay here
until l know he's safe.
- No, l don't think that's a good idea.
- Why not?
There are a lot of
hungry characters around here.
l think you do not understand.
Erik is all that's left for me
in the world and now he's gone...
Yeah, l understand.
l'm sorry.
Oh, pardon me.
- Happy days, old boy.
- And nights.
Rosie!
- Rosie!
- l'm coming.
Come on, love,
or all the bubbly'll be gone.
- How about these?
- Is that all you could get?
All l could get?
There is a war on, you know.
You could have fooled me.
l'm gonna get some more tin cans.
Sounds like quite a party.
Wanna join 'em?
No. l'm not in a party mood.
- l think l'll just go up to my room.
- All right.
You don't have to see me in.
l promised Erik l'd take care of you.
You don't want to throw me
to those hungry characters.
That's right.
- # Here comes the bride
- # Short, fat and wide
- Skipper, want to kiss the bride?
- You bet.
Hey, that's enough.
- Good luck, Bissel.
- l've brought my luck with me.
Don't worry. It's not contagious.
- You sure?
- Yes, l'm sure.
- Well, good night, and thank you.
- Good night.
- Oh, Hilde.
- Yes?
Uh...
- l've been grounded.
- ''Grounded''?
That means that l won't be
flying for a couple of days and, um...
l was wondering if tomorrow
you were free, maybe you...
lf you're inviting me, the answer is yes.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Erik! Erik!
- It's good to have you back.
- Down!
- They haven't patrolled here before.
- It happened three days ago.
for a bridge Goth blew up.
You had orders. No attacks.
His sister was raped.
We must bury the chute.
With all the German patrols,
it would be better to wait till dark.
We can't. The weapons must
get through to the other units.
Easy.
Slow down at the barricade.
Halte!
- Go!
- Halte!
Agh!
Over the bridge, l'll cover you!
Go on! Over the bridge!
Fa_g ih_ lebe_d!
Wo haben Sie das bekommen?
Wo? Wo?
Agh!
- What did you do before the war, Roy?
- l was a barnstormer.
Barnstormer?
Yeah, aerial circuses, aerobatics.
Things like that.
Now you fly in the war.
- Do you hate the Germans?
- l never met any.
The only ones l've ever seen
have been through a gun sight.
Not the best way to get acquainted.
Then why did you enter the war so early?
l had to do something. The air circus
folded so l joined the Eagle Squadron.
lt was di_erent with me.
Where l grew up,
everything was very safe.
Uh-oh. l got one.
- Bring him in before he gets away.
- Oh, no, he might throw the hook.
The idea is to give him a little bit of play.
lt's a sardine! It's a Norwegian sardine!
How'd he get over here?
All right, little sardine. Back you go.
Now, here.
Do you wanna take that over there?
Straighten the line out.
That's it. Get it straight now.
Hey, you're very good.
l used to do it for the fishermen.
And sometimes they even took me out
on the boat with them.
Hey, Don. You're up late.
Roy. They've captured Erik.
The Gestapo's got him.
They've had him since this morning.
You know what that means?
They'll work on him and they'll
break him down and make him talk.
This whole operation's in danger
unless we can stop it.
- How?
- We know the building they've got him in.
Gestapo headquarters in Bergen.
This building must be bombed.
We believe that a single Mosquito might
get through tonight and stop them.
- You want a killer, right?
- We need a man to do a job.
You want a killer.
Listen, Roy.
Do you remember Charlie, my collie,
how we nursed him
when he was run over by a lorry?
But it was no good.
He was in pain, so l had to shoot him.
This isn't a canine love story.
We're talking about a man's life.
We are talking about many men's lives.
l'm grounded, remember?
That order could be rescinded
in the circumstances.
What circumstances?
lf you should happen to volunteer.
- Is there a choice?
- Yes.
lt's a hell of a choice.
Who'll be my navigator?
Bissel's volunteered.
OK. Tell them to get my plane ready.
l'll be out in about half an hour.
We'll be waiting for you.
Get me the Black Swan.
How are you feeling, Lieutenant?
Not very sociable.
Listen to me, Lieutenant.
l'm going to ask you some questions.
You will have to answer them
sooner or later.
You will save yourself
much pain by answering now.
What were you doing in England
and whom did you see there?
l was not in England.
Come, Lieutenant. Those canisters
and weapons we've found.
l know nothing about them.
You are insulting our intelligence.
We'll try something nearer home.
What is the location
of your Underground headquarters?
l have nothing to say.
Surely you will not deny
you are a member?
l have nothing to say.
l'm afraid we shall have to persuade you.
Take o_ his clothes.
Advise Intelligence,
one aircraft dispatched,
en route to predesignated
Norwegian target.
Yes.
l can be reached here
at Sutton Craddock Operations.
We'll wait.
He should be iust crossing the coast now.
- If Bergman talks...
- He won't talk.
We'll know soon enough.
Go on, Lieutenant. What else?
Well, Lieutenant?
There's the building.
Blue Leader to Co_trol.
Blue Leader to Co_trol.
The wheel's down, but one light's
showing. l don't think it's locked.
All crash crews. All crash crews
stand by for emergency landing.
Hang on, Bissel.
This might be a little rough.
Oh, my God. Bissel.
Hold it, son.
Get him out of there!
And you're quite sure
it was Gestapo headquarters you hit.
Yes, sir.
Then we can assume
that Bergman is dead.
Yes, sir.
Grant, it may seem ironic to you
but l'm going to recommend you
for an award for what you did today.
lt may have saved the whole operation.
Shall l break the news
to Bergman's sister, Roy?
l shan't mention your part, of course.
No. l'll, uh... tell her.
Gentlemen, l can't take a chance
on anything else going wrong.
l'm going to move up the operation.
Take off 0330 hours tomorrow morning.
- But, sir, what about the bombs?
- They'll be here tonight.
Adams, contact the Linge. Tell them
to plan their attack for tomorrow.
- Yes, sir. At what time?
- Daybreak.
Grant, you better get that wound seen to.
Sir?
How's a man going to be,
without a face and blind?
Awful, isn't it, sir?
l killed him, Hilde.
He was in the building...
and l knew it.
You knew... they were torturing him.
You stopped it.
Erik cannot thank you, Roy.
So... l thank you for him.
Goodbye, Hilde.
Goodbye?
Another mission?
l will wait for you.
l'm glad.
Oh, Roy.
Please come back.
Please do come back.
We've got a date.
Now, the bombs you'll be using
are what we call earthquake bombs.
And that is literally their purpose,
to cause an earthquake
which will bring down
the overhanging section of this mountain
and bury that factory which the Germans
have built there, under that cliff.
All right, gentlemen.
You may return to your seats.
Squadron Leader Adams will now
continue with the briefing.
This is the flight plan
from Sutton traddock.
By following this dogleg,
the chances of losing the surprise
element over the sea are reduced.
lf you are detected,
this route will lead the enemy to believe
that you're on a coastal shipping strike.
Wing Commander Grant, anything to add?
l'd just like to remind the men
that we will drop the bombs
within 50 yards of each other,
at ten-second intervals.
The geologists calculate
that 1 2 bombs of this size,
exploding in this pattern,
will break loose the overhang.
Skipper, excuse me.
l'd like to ask a question.
Go ahead.
lsn't it likely that each plane
could be blown apart
by the explosion
of the bomb in front of it?
Not if our calculations are correct.
Hope you've got a good calculator.
With those gun emplacements,
won't the flak be murderous?
The Norwegian Underground will attack
those emplacements at exactly 0630.
Which means that you should be entering
the fjord not earlier than 0655,
and not later than 0705.
- Squadron Leader Adams.
- Time check your watches.
lt's coming up to 2.47 in...
five... four...
three... two...
one... check.
Your call sign is Everest.
The code for the successful completion
of the operation is Vesuvius.
Sounds like that mountain
could turn into a bloody big volcano.
Yes, and we hope
the Germans will be under it.
- Any further questions?
- Yes, sir.
l've got a question.
Just a bit of curiosity, really,
but what does that factory make?
You'll be told that when you get back.
This much l can tell you, though.

All their sacrifice?
A successful operation.
But they're probably all dead.
All 633 Squadron.
You can't kill a squadron.
