Pull him round. Pull him round.
That's it!
Let him up.
G'day, Martin.
Dick.
Mongrel-looking turnouts, aren't they?
Latest mob
from the Queensland property.
Yes, they won't make
the Barrington fortune.
They'll fatten on good pasture,
bring us a price.
One of them got Dad last year.
Yeah. Yeah, that was rotten luck.
Give one to your mate, you bludger.
It's good to see you.
Good to see you.
Look at you.
Flash as a rat with a gold tooth.
Bush lout.
How come you're back from university?
Oh, mate, it's a long, long story.
Oh, it's like that, is it?
What's Sir Rupert think about it?
Well, I've been dodging Father
since I got in last night.
You'll get away with it.
You always have, you bludger.
Hey, I'm not the only one
bludging on the Barringtons.
Right, you lot. What do you
think this is, a bloody picnic?
Come on, Marty. There, mate.
Marty! You don't learn this
at university, mate.
Come on, sugar. Do some work, mate.
What do you think this is? Bush week?
I tell you what, mate.
How about you and me go up
the Queensland property for a while?
We'll clear out those scrubber bulls
and put some good bloodstock
in among them.
Yeah.
Alright, you're on.
With a bit of practice,
you might make a fair offsider.
I'll tell you what.
I'll speak to Father about it.
Hey, it looks like you've got
your chance.
You ready to release him?
OK, easy. Let him go.
Smoko.
Is there a shortage of stockmen?
Well, I thought I'd just help...
I missed you at breakfast, Martin.
Wanted an early ride.
I see.
Dick and I were talking about
the Queensland prop...
I haven't time now.
See me in my study
first thing after lunch.
Goddammit, boy!
You can't just walk out
of university like that.
Well, I have.
You owe me an explanation.
Father, I've had years of schooling.
It's enough.
What relevance is a degree
in running a cattle property, anyway?
I don't want you as just another
farmer, secure in his provincialism.
I had hoped you'd go on
to my old college at Cambridge.
What I want is to learn this trade.
An unfortunate term.
Just give me some breathing space
for a year,
then, if you wish, I'll take my degree.
Dick was talking about the Queensland...
Out of the question!
Why?!
There's going to be a war.
I won't have a Barrington in the outback
while the mother country is in peril.
Father, what are you talking about?
That war, if it happens,
will be 12,000 miles away.
What's it got to do with us?
Your shallowness astounds me.
Perhaps university was a waste of time.
Martin, we are British, and being...
Oh, I thought we were Australian,
Father.
And being British carries with it
responsibility as well as privilege.
Whatever the Europeans want to do
is no business of ours.
If Britain goes down,
how long will this country stand?
I've heard all these arguments...
You may have heard it,
but you obviously haven't listened to it.
I'm not going back this year.
I accept that, Martin.
This year we will have
important things to do.
I may have an interesting surprise
for you
which will resolve all our difficulties.
We'll talk later when I know more.
Bit of a trimmer, eh?
Oh, alright if you like 'em thin.
Built like a racing tadpole.
Well, well.
'Poddy Calf' Jackson
and 'Left-Hand' McGee.
Eh, fair go! That was a long time ago.
Stone the crows. It's Kate Baker.
Oh, Kate.
Why didn't you let on it was you?
Thought you was one of the city sheilas.
I am a city sheila.
Well?
Well, what?
Give us a lift with the luggage.
That's if your brain can send
a message to your limbs.
I was expecting the anger.
I was surprised at the hurt.
One generally is at your age.
He seems to have this great master plan.
I don't know if I'm ready for it.
Martin, you're his only child.
That makes it so much harder on him.
On all of us.
We were hoping that you'd follow the
family traditionand finish at Cambridge.
Yes, and acquire
that all-important veneer
of European civilisation.
Oh, you've no taste
for European culture?
Culture? Mother, they're tearing
each other's throats out over there.
Don't worry.
It's a half a world away.
KATE: Mum, I'm not running off.
I'm just going to visit Dick for a few days.
You can come if you like.
Hmph!
Don't see much of your brother, either,
since he's kicked on
at the Barrington place.
Bloody rich squatters.
Imitation Pommies.
Use up the working people,
then throw them aside
when they're no longer wanted.
Oh, a cottage for life and a pension
is hardly what I'd call
being 'thrown aside'.
It doesn't bring your father back.
That larrikin son of theirs is home.
Martin?
Yeah. They reckon he got kicked out
of that fancy university.
Probably swallowed his silver spoon.
And the Prime Minister has sent
a cable to London, saying,
"Indescribable enthusiasm and entire
unanimity throughout Australia
"in support of the Empire in war."
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.
We have never been so united.
The whole colony will give its...
Nation, Father.
We're no longer a colony.
Er, 'nation', then.
We are not at war yet, Rupert.
We will be at any moment.
The Prussians have been rampaging
through Belgium and France
for two days now,
and they are well past
the deadline of Britain's ultimatum.
Today's papers report that there's
been an exchange of messages
between the Tsar,
the Kaiser and King George.
Those three are cousins.
One must pray sanity will prevail.
My dear George, you will
never change. Always naive.
Well, Rupert, if it is naivety
to hope that the nations
of our great Western civilisation
can settle their differences
like rational people,
then I am as you say.
If a simple farmer like myself
can see the thing clearly
then surely you, as a scholar, can.
Whatever the cause, whatever
the excuse, the issue is quite plain.
Germany is out for world domination.
She has planned it
and will not be deterred.
I say, so be it.
If we must fight,
we of the British Empire,
then let's do it now and
put the Prussian back in his place.
Quite agree, Rupert.
A summer storm
to clear the air over Europe.
MAN: Hear, hear.
Would you excuse me?
Rupert has organised with the Cabinet
that they telephone him
when a decision's been made.
It's probably only the butcher.
I say, Martin -
if it starts, will you be going?
Most definitely.
Oh, terrific.
To Queensland.
Oh.
What a pity. You'd look splendid
in one of those red coats.
I think they went out
in the Zulu wars, Lydia.
Oh. Nobody told me.
Ladies and gentlemen, Great Britain
has declared war on Germany.
Not before time, either, Rupert.
Australia, New Zealand and Canada
have announced
they will be raising forces immediately.
Good show. Jolly good.
Once we of the Empire
set our minds to it...
Roberts, tell the staff
to tap the barrel now.
I could be a nurse.
You faint at the sight of blood.
Well, then, perhaps
I could read to the wounded.
MAN: Well, my dear, this will teach
those Germans once and for all.
Well, for better
or for worse, here's to Australia.
Australia.
No, Martin, we shall drink
the toasts in their proper order.
The King, God bless him, the Empire,
and then the land we love, Australia.
ALL: The King, the Empire, Australia.
If I may have your attention
for one last time...
Now is the time to confess
to a gentle conspiracy
I had undertaken on Martin's behalf.
In anticipation of the stirring news
which came tonight
I cabled my old comrade,
the colonel of the Rifle Brigade.
That's the English regiment
I had the honour to serve with
during the Boer War.
I received the reply from London today.
The Rifle Brigade is pleased to accept
my son Martin into the regiment
with the rank of 2nd Lieutenant.
Dick!
You getting tidy in your old age, mate?
Dick!
Oh...
Kate!
My God. A vision of loveliness.
Spare me the Barrington wit.
The barrel's down that way.
To hell with the barrel.
Mmm. Do I hear a note of petulance?
Very likely. Which shoulder can I cry on?
Neither.
Oh, come on, then. Tell all.
Oh, no. I'd rather talk about you.
They tell me you're a qualified
nurse now. Congratulations.
Thank you, squire.
So, will you be staying in Tolangerook?
Oh, not on your life.
That nursing certificate
is my passport out of the bush.
Is the bush that bad?
From my point of view it is, yes.
I have two choices here -
marriage and childbirth
or childbirth and marriage.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
I'm just looking for a soapbox
or something you can preach from.
Oh, you!
I'll get you!
Hey! Who's going the grope
on my sister?
Oh, look, there's ants at every picnic!
Oh, boys will be boys.
The three of us, huh, just like old times.
Old times don't come back.
No, we'll make them.
Coming down for a beer?
Oh, no. I wouldn't want to spoil
their little war fever.
I came to talk about Queensland.
I'm going whether Father likes it or not.
Oh, yeah, Queensland.
Well, there's been
a bit of a change of plan.
What? It was your idea.
Well, er, me and the boys
are gonna join up.
Oh, come on, Marty. Wouldn't want
to miss out. See some of the world.
I've seen some of the world.
That's why I like it here.
They reckon it'll be over by Christmas.
We'll go to Queensland next year.
You gotta be in it, mate.
Gotta laugh.
'Night, all.
What the hell was that all about?
He's having trouble
making his first decision.
Oh.
MAN: All of Europe is threatened
by the treacherous Hun,
even the mother country herself,
fair England.
Australia too is now in the play.
Would we have had it otherwise?!
ALL: No!
It's only an old piece of bunting.
It's only an old piece of rag.
But many have died for its honour
and shed their life's blood for the flag.
And in the short space of 13 years
since our nation's birth, our own flag.
Is it worthy of sacrifice?
Is it ready for its baptism of fire?
I now call for volunteers to step forward
and be the first of the new
Australian lmperial Force.
Why, if it isn't Tom McArthur,
a hero of the football field...
...who no doubt could be a hero
of that other, greater field.
Who's next? Come on, boys! Step up!
Would to God that I could be with you!
Should old acquaintance
be forgot?
No! No! No, no, no!
Australia will be there...
I've gotta be in it, Mum!
Roly, no! You're too young!
Fair go, Mum! A bloke couldn't miss this!
It's Australia's first chance to prove
something to the rest of the world.
Now, that's what I want, boys!
Come on, the rest of you too!
I want you to get in the line, sign up,
and I'll be right there,
right there with you, boys!
Hey, come on, you blokes!
You joining up?
Course we are. We'll be there.
Take care of me dog, mate.
He'll follow me all the way to Ballarat.
Where's your fine friend
Barrington now?
Martin's alright.
I didn't ask about his health.
I asked where is he right now
when he's wanted among his mates.
Marty can make up his own mind.
Dick, what are you waiting for?
The war will be over
by the time we arrive.
MAN: About time you got here, Andy.
Finished your shearing or what?
Come on, Dick. Let's go.
'Bye! 'Bye, boys!
Thank you for dropping in so promptly,
Martin. Sit down, boy.
We'll miss young Baker.
He's leaving today, I understand.
Yes.
Waste of time, of course.
He'll be back before long.
The Australian army - no future there.
Probably only used for garrison
duties behind the line.
Well, Martin, what about you?
I suppose I'll be off
to the Queensland property.
The Empire's at war, blast it!
You say our fellows
won't get near it. Why bother?
I offered you an honourable alternative.
English commission.
Is that all you've got to say about
the finest regimentin the British army?
Father, it's not for me.
I don't understand
one damn thing about you now
except your desire
to contradict me at every turn.
Father, I'm NOT contradicting you.
It's MY life, and...
Then I suggest you get on with it!
...and it's MY decision!
Might as well let him go.
They'll be home soon, anyway.
Mrs Baker.
Came to see them off, did you?
Uh-huh.
Well, you're too late!
Well, I'd better get after them
and make my farewells.
It's a lovely day for a ride.
Care to join me?
Yah.
Yah!
No point in walking the whole way.
Which way are you heading?
Queensland.
Oh. I'm going to France.
Yeah, well, that's what I mean.
I'm heading to Queensland
the long way, via France.
You and I
have got an arrangement, mate!
Thanks, Kate. Be seeing you.
Yes, you probably will.
You pack your lunch?
See ya, fella! Whoo-hoo!
Good to have you with us.
How far we got, eh?
What's Sir Rupert got to say?
Sir Rupert's as pissed as hell.
Oh, yeah.
I bet he's not too happy about it.
Boys, boys!
I cannot let this historic moment
pass without a few words.
As your member of Parliament,
most of you know me.
MAN: Those of you that don't,
keep your hands on your wallets.
We are as one on this great issue.
Australia will defend the mother country
to the last man and the last shilling!
Would to God
that I could go with you, boys.
Oh, no. A fair dinkum 'would to God-er'.
As one whose duty
lies at the home front,
I want you boys always to know that
Cyril Earnshaw is right behind you!
Yeah - 12,000 miles behind you.
If you had one speck of shame
you'd join up.
I am gonna join up -
gonna join your outfit.
My outfit?
Yeah, 'B' Company. Be here when they
go and be here when they come back.
Bloody bastard!
Come on, Marty.
You joining us, are you?
I might as well.
Comes to a choice between facing
the guns and old windbags like him,
I'll take the guns every time.
Pat Cleary.
Martin Barrington.
Pleased to meet you, mate.
Whoa!
Crikey - if we organised a cattle muster
like this, we'd all get the sack.
Yeah, I've seen better organised
duck raffles in country pubs.
They never expected
so many volunteers.
It'll take them months
to get organised.
We won't miss out, will we?
No, we'll make it.
Geez, I remember a big muster
up on the Barcoo.
That was organisation for you.
We had, what,
Oh, here we go!
No, fair dinkum.
They were coming in
from 100 mile around.
It was so dusty, we had to shear
by lamplight in the middle of the day.
MAN: Right, you lot, on your feet.
On your feet, I said. Look sharp!
Do any of you blokes
know anything about music?
Well, er, I studied a little, sir.
Good. You and your mates,
shift that piano into the officer's mess.
Get on your way!
First lesson -
never volunteer for anything.
Good on you, Marty.
Excuse me, sir - can I help them?
What's your name, son?
Roly.
Roly what?
Roly Collins, sir.
Right. On your way, Collins.
MAN: Keep it still. Inward advance.
Left turn!
Left, I said, the man with the big hat!
Steady. And easy.
Men of No. 3 Platoon,
I am Lieutenant Harold Armstrong
and I am your platoon officer.
You have all joined the colours
of your own free will
for the duration of the war.
As volunteers, you will be treated
like intelligent adults.
Our battalion, the 8th,
has formed so rapidly
that there is a shortage
of non-commissioned officers,
so I have two temporary appointments
to make.
Firstly, is there any man
who feels he has the experience
to perform the duties
of platoon sergeant?
Sir! McArthur,
sergeant with the 'F' Dunoon Rifles.
Yes, McArthur. You will have
three weeks trial as sergeant.
Now, a volunteer for corporal.
Come, come, lads.
It's worth an extra shilling a day.
Easy.
I will have that man there.
Do you agree, Private Barrington?
You were a cadet lieutenant,
I understand.
Yes, sir, if that's what you want, sir.
Good. Then that's settled.
Sergeant McArthur, take the men away
and get them better dressed,
then give them two hours
of close-order drill.
McARTHUR: Sir! Platoon... attention!
McARTHUR: Platoon... halt!
Platoon... will advance. Left turn!
Righto, you men.
Let's get to know each other.
Now, you all know who I am.
You may think those high-and-mighty
officers run the army.
Well, you'd be wrong.
The army's run by sergeants.
Always thought Bligh was a captain,
not a sergeant.
What was that?
I said they should have
made you a captain, Sergeant.
Yeah.
Righto, I want you to call out your names
and tell us what you did in civvy life.
Johansen, dairy farmer.
Johansen, dairy farmer.
Well, well, what have we got here?
Not Dutch, Sergeant, Danish.
Carry on.
Harris, rouseabout.
You a Pommy, Harris?
English, Sergeant.
I've been watching you, Harris.
Seems you've been in the army before.
I was in the Boy Scouts, wasn't I?
Is that so?
Next.
Collins. Bootmaker.
Baker. Stockman.
Cleary - middleweight champion
of north Queensland,
all-time champion horse breaker
of the outer Barcoo,
and breaker
of women's hearts everywhere.
ALL: Ohhh...
Anything else?
Well, sometimes I tell lies.
Shut up, Cleary.
Next.
Barrington. Student.
You're a bit old to be in short pants,
aren't you, Barrington?
They keep you back a couple of grades?
University student, Sergeant.
Oh, an educated man.
Well, it's real nice to have
a silvertail like you in the platoon.
I thought we joined up
to fight the Germans.
What was that?!
Come on! Speak up, laddie,
so we can all hear!
I said I thought we joined up
to fight the Germans, Sergeant,
not each other.
There's another thing you ought to know.
Now that you're in the army,
you all come under King's regulations.
That's a big, thick book where they list
all the crimes they can think of.
For the crimes they HAVEN'T thought of,
the offender will have to
deal with me in person.
Things like having a big mouth, Cleary.
Me?
The penalty might be
meeting me behind the tents at night.
Right, then. Let's begin.
Now, get back to attention!
Platoon... right turn!
By the left... quick... march!
Pull it back.
Deep breath.
Try again. One, two, three...
Like the story of the old bull
and the younger one, mate.
Alright, fellas.
Put these on your service dress
and we're off to the firing range.
Hey, bewdy!
Hang on, Marty.
That's Australia. I'm a Queenslander.
Bad luck, Pat.
Officially Australian now, mate.
Oh, well, that's not so bad. I thought
you might make me a Victorian.
What's wrong with Victorians,
you banana-bender?
ALL: Yeah!
Have you got a couple of hours?
Hey, watch yourself.
Blimey, it takes
a bleeding war in Europe
to make you lot understand
you all belong to the same country.
He's right, you know.
Oh, yeah, he's right, you know.
Yeah, Bill.
Yeah, takes a Pommy...
Oi!
At your targets, 10 rounds.
Fire!
I think we underestimated these men,
Sergeant.
A letter from your regiment, dear.
The Germans have been repulsed
outside Paris.
They won't be able to take much of this.
Should be over soon.
Yes, dear,
that's what you said weeks ago.
And we've heard of nothing
but defeats and retreats.
Martin seems to have got in with
a group of amusing young men.
A man called Cleary has
taught him how to play... two-up.
What on earth is two-up?
Do you remember Bertie Oldfield?
We met him
when we were in London last year.
Yes. He was a captain
in your regiment, wasn't he?
And Tony Wentworth-Jones...
...and Sandy Fitzwilliam.
Bellamy Carew.
Yes, I remem...
They're all dead.
They and 20 other officers
of the 2nd Battalion and 389 other ranks.
It's the 2nd Battalion
that offered Martin a commission.
I'm sorry, Thea.
It's the suddenness of it.
The finest regiment
in the British regular army...
...destroyed.
Come on, boys, get yourselves set
at Honest Pat's Two-Up School,
famous the length and breadth
of the outback.
The Murrumbidgee Kid's throwing
at the moment,
going for his fourth straight head.
Hey, Pat.
Eh? Oh, not now, Roly.
I don't take underage bets.
No, I just wanted to tell you...
Not now, mate.
We all covered on the side?
Yeah, yeah.
All covered heads?
In the centre, all covered?
Alright, come in spinner.
Tails pays. Tails is a big winner.
Discount 10%
for wear and tear on the carpet.
They said to tell you
that they're going to the pub.
Pub's out of bounds.
I've organised a back room.
Good on you, Roly.
Tell 'em I'll be there in five minutes.
The way I'm going, I'll be shouting.
OK.
We got that other spinner?
No class at all, mate.
Yeah.
Oh, well, you'll be happy enough
here, Bill.
Looks like an English pub.
Don't mind, so long as they serve beer.
DICK: Pull up a pumpkin and sit down.
Yeah.
Ah, good evening, gents.
Sorry for serving you out here.
The saloon's full of officers,
the bar's full of sergeants.
You wouldn't want to mix with them.
Give us five pints of beer, landlord.
Oh, no, thanks, Pat.
Four beers and a lemon squash, mate.
Eh?
Well, I signed the pledge.
I promised my mum I wouldn't drink.
Alright, four pints of beer
and a pint of lemon squash
for our mate here.
His wife wears her cardigan
backwards, right?
"And furthermore," he says,
"all the sheep bear
a remarkable family resemblance."
Good one, Pat!
Crikey, I know that feeling.
Yeah, but never as plastered as that.
Why don't you
shut your noisy mouths...
Oh, Jesus, you lot.
How'd you be, huh?
A man works all week and they come
back to haunt you after hours.
I ought to do the lot of you.
But I won't, no, no.
I'm gonna put you all on a charge.
You couldn't walk back to camp,
let alone write out a charge sheet.
You had it comin', pal!
Hey, take it easy, Sarge.
It's my fault. I brought 'em here.
Piss off!
Why don't you start with
someone your own size?
BILL: Have you hurt him, Dick?
No chance.
I tell you what, though - I'd think
twice about tackling him sober.
You alright, Roly?
Yeah, mate.
We better go. The place
will be crawling with jacks.
We can't just leave him like that.
No, you're right.
Come on, McArthur, wake up.
Blast you.
The whole lot of you.
You think it's all a game.
We don't think it's a game, Sarge.
Yes, you do - a big bloody game!
You poor buggers are going to a war!
A bullet in the guts is the best
you can expect, like my old man.
Like my old man.
It took him 10 years to die.
I heard him coughing it up every night.
Which way is it meant to go?
Straight ahead.
Straight ahead?
Hey, look at that. We've got
more important things to do.
Morning, Sister.
Can I carry your gear for you?
You certainly can.
Struth, what are you doing here?
Mum sent me to keep an eye on you.
You can carry your own gear, sis.
Morning, Sister.
May I be
of assistance, ma'am?
Thank you, Private.
Corporal.
Where are you ladies staying?
So, this is what you meant
when you said you'd see us.
I've had my name down
on the reserves for months.
And you never told us.
You never asked.
It's really good to see you.
You coming to France with us?
Mm-hm.
France. I can tell you a few stories...
Put the bags down here,
please, Corporal.
Oh... ... cut the 'Corporal'.
Oh, I see.
Army rules. Some places
are out of bounds to other ranks.
But you'd understand that,
wouldn't you?
Just like the big house
at Hereford Downs.
Well, one to you, madam,
but I'll even the score.
What - by applying for a commission?
I wouldn't go that far. I'll get you back.
BILL: I wasn't complaining, mind you.
I've always been a top man, myself,
on that sort of score.
So we went for a daytrip -
just a daytrip, mind.
Little town called Bologne.
Nice grub, but the beer wasn't much.
Someone said the other day
that the French eat frog's legs.
I don't think I'd like that much.
G'day, boys.
ALL: G'day, Dick.
What do you reckon, Marty?
What's that?
They're saying in France,
we could eat frog's legs.
It's not compulsory.
What, so you've been, then?
Mm-hm.
Life's fairly snouted
the young squire today.
My sister's a lieutenant and
Martin Barrington's only a corporal.
Good on you, Dick.
Alright, alright, what's France like?
Well, I went up the Loire Valley,
and it was, well, like something
you've never seen before.
A great, slow river that never
runs dry, vineyards, castles.
A sun that never gets too hot.
Any sheilas?
For sheilas, you should try Paris.
Well, go on.
Folies Bergere, Moulin Rouge,
Bal Tabarin.
Wine, women and song
right round the clock.
ROLY: One soon learns to expect
the unexpected in the army.
On the day our transports were getting
ready to leave Australian waters,
Turkey came into the war
on Germany's side.
Instead of the fields of France,
it was the sands of Egypt.
Now, after five months of training, we're
heading for a place called Gallipoli.
Martin said the idea was to attack
Germany through the back door.
They even gave us a new name
for the occasion - ANZAC.
Well, Pat says it sounds like
a South American Indian tribe,
but it stands for the Australian
and New Zealand Army Corps.
The mood was quiet.
The boys knew that all of Australia
would be watching us today.
Oh, God, our help
in ages past
Our hope for years to come...
What are you
breaking up the crate for?
Firewood, Roly.
Haven't you ever been in the bush?
Course not. He was brought up
respectable, weren't you, Roly?
Now, remember, lads,
the biscuits and water you have
are to last for three days.
There's nothing else
at this spot in Gallipoli.
Right, skip.
Nothing but Turkish soldiers.
Stub out that cigarette.
Now, we turn left once ashore,
do the beach quickly.
No smoking.
Good luck to you, lads.
You too, skip.
Good luck to you, sir.
Good luck, Roly.
Three days rations, boys -
the biscuits and the water.
Look after 'em.
Three days on the rations.
Here we go, Marty. Here's to Australia!
Get off the beach! Move, move, move!
Double, double, double!
ready and out! Come on!
The boys are over this side.
Rest of us are here
except Trellow and Smith.
Come on, come on. Let's get up there.
Sir, the blokes are all mixed up.
I can't contact the company.
You and 100 others.
But the map doesn't make sense.
You're dead right there.
Get a message to the Colonel.
Tell him they've landed us
a mile to the north.
Hear that? We're on the wrong beach.
Hey, slip up and tell the Turks
it's a mistake.
You bloody tell them, Cleary!
Not me.
Come on, 2 section! Move!
Stay in close to the wall!
Move in closer!
Sergeant, advance your section now!
Karl, can you make it?
Move out, faster!
Hang on, old son.
Medical section will be along soon.
Ready, Erik?
Move them up, Sergeant!
OFFICER: On your feet, Johansen.
Up here!
Stretcher-bearers!
Watch your footing!
Keep down!
Forward!
Ready, Pat?
Ready.
Just my luck to be stuck with
a bloody pocket Napoleon.
FIRE!
Go.
Arggh!
Marty! Dick!
Where are you going?
Just cover me.
Dick.
OK.
Bloody hell. Let's dismantle the gun
and get out of here.
Where's your sergeant mate?
Lost him.
Down, mate.
Bloody thing's back-to-front.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on, boys!
It's no good, mate. We're lost.
Do you know which way to the beach?
I may be buggered, but not stupid.
Look, mate,
what do I know about the bush?
We can't do it. You go.
I'm not going without you, mate.
We're getting out of here.
Fall.
How are ya, mate?
Alive.
What are you doing? Having a picnic?
You should be helping
dig in along this ridge.
It's only 11 o'clock.
We're miles short of our objective.
The home team's got everything
in its favour.
They've got all the high ground.
They know the bloody country.
They've got reinforcements coming.
I reckon we're in real strife.
It's no good. It's too steep.
Throw me over - I'll manage.
But it will kill ya.
Quick!
Let go!
Arggh!
You know, someone said that the main
weapon in this war would be a shovel.
They're not wrong, mate.
See anything, Dick?
No, but they're out there, alright.
'A' Company, stand tall.
Something stirring, sir?
Yes, they're mounting a counterattack.
We'll hold?
Look around. What do you think?
Good luck, Martin.
Same to you, sir.
Pick off your target!
Don't waste ammunition!
Struth, it's like getting in
the last keg at the butchers' picnic.
You gotta pay the old Turk -
he comes on like a train.
What are you doing, Baker?
Having a tea-break?
There's gotta be a nark at every party.
They're all heading back. Dick!
They've had enough. Have a look.
'Bye, Abdul.
Reports this section, Corporal.
They've retreated, sir.
Told you we'd hold 'em.
Another step back and we'd have been
up to our necks in salt water.
It's not over yet, Martin.
The ANZAC Corps commander, sir.
I came ashore as soon as I could.
Well, those, er, New Zealanders
and Australians of yours, Bridges,
have done a magnificent job.
Someone made a similar remark AFTER
the Charge of the Light Brigade.
If you have something to say then say it.
I believe it's time
to seriously consider evacuation.
Good God, man, do you realise?
We have been landed
in the wrong place,
we have failed to take
any of our objectives,
our men are clinging to chasms
and to cliffs.
If one part of the line breaks, the Turks
will be on the beach in minutes.
Fellas, Roly's back.
A few cuts and scratches,
but he's alive and kicking.
Pat.
Told you, the kid's a born survivor.
He's got quite a story to tell.
Yeah, I have.
I started going back to the beach...
Oi. Save it.
What's wrong with you?
Where's Dick?
He went to look for those
wounded blokes we heard calling.
What?!
We tried to stop him, but you know Dick.
Turks could swarm this gully any minute.
Yep.
Dick, you stupid bastard.
Hey.
Arggh!
Stretcher-bearer!
Do you realise
I have committed my last reserves?
Walker, where have you been?
Taking on the Turks single-handed?
No, sir. I have been...
No, let General Bridges summarise.
Of my three brigades, one has ceased
to exist as a fighting formation.
The other two
have suffered severe casualties.
Where are you getting
your information from?
From wounded
and men returning to the beach.
God, what have shocked men and
stragglers to say that is accurate?
It leads me to the conclusion
that our fighting spirit
that has held up so far will crack
under this impossible pressure.
I believe we should evacuate
before this happens.
An evacuation at night in contact with the
enemy - that's a recipe for a shambles.
I'd rather stay and die on the beach.
I visited a number of the forward
companies. They're holding well.
Up there, the thought of failure
hasn't even entered their heads.
I cannot take responsibility
for evacuation.
And I have a responsibility to the
government of Australia and my men.
Signal from
the Commander-in-Chief, sir.
Thank you.
"Your news is indeed serious.
"There is nothing for it but to dig in and
to stick it out. Evacuation is impossible.
"You have got through
the worst of the business.
"All you have to do now is to dig,
dig, dig until you are safe."
Signed... lan Hamilton,
Commander-in-Chief.
Well, there it is.
You know, Bridges,
you may have underestimated
those Australians of yours.
DICK: It's me. I'm coming in.
Watch the arm.
Oh, beauty.
Jacko.
I knew my mates
wouldn't let me down.
Come on, old son,
let's get you comfortable.
There's scores of poor coots
out there who'll never be found.
Good to see you back, mate.
G'day, Roly.
Still in the land of the living, eh?
What's up?
Where's Marty?
He got knocked 10 minutes ago.
Bad?
Through the stomach.
You're to be Acting Corporal, Dick.
I'm not gonna take Martin's place.
What about Bill?
I want you.
Crikey, he's a better soldier.
This is not a debating society, Baker.
Though listening to some
of you, you'd think so.
Mr Armstrong wants you,
and that's the end of it, right?
Right? Now, sort out the reinforcements.
Smartly.
Only three.
Yeah. Two got knocked coming up.
Names.
Richie, Warner. I'm Flanagan.
OK, you blokes find
Cleary, Harris and Collins.
One each - they'll show you the ropes.
Get going!
What's the matter with you?
Someone pinch your bag of lollies?
You could be handy if you
don't get your block knocked off.
Tiny.
Thanks, mate.
Any pain?
Nah, not much.
Do you ever go into the lotteries?
No. Why?
Well, you ought to.
We found the bullet. Bounced off
your ribs, ended near your pelvis.
Missed every vital organ on the way.
You're a very lucky fella.
Have any trouble
getting it out, or?
No, we didn't get it out. Don't
worry, it's less dangerous that way.
Oh, well, thanks anyway.
It's all part of the service.
That reminds me.
I've got a letter for you.
I'll give you a hand, eh?
Good on you. Thanks very much.
I see you're in the 8th.
Mmm.
Those nurses who came with the 8th
will move here next month.
Oh, yeah.
Aye, aye. Anyone in particular?
Yeah. Sister Baker. Do you know her?
Do I? Doesn't everybody?
When's she due in?
I'll let you know.
ROLY: "Dear Martin,
"the news came through at last
that you were alive and recovering.
"It lifted the spirits of the platoon,
particularly Dick and Mr Armstrong.
"It was a real pleasure to see them
back to their old selves again.
"Not that there's many
of the old faces left. Just 11.
"Things have been pretty lively
over here, I can tell you.
"Well, even the generals aren't safe.
"General Bridges, our commanding
general, was killed the other day.
"A few of the new reinforcements
showed up well,
"particularly a bloke called Flanagan.
"He's sort of like
Bill and Pat in a way -
"he's got a nose for trouble
and can anticipate it.
"I know you'll like him.
"Most of us have had a few more
nicks, including yours truly,
"but nothing serious.
"There's some furphy about
some big attack, so stay in hospital.
"Pat says only mugs live here.
"The best from all the boys,
even McArthur.
"Yours, Roly."
Hey. Take a look.
Oh, God.
Angel from heaven, boys.
MAN: Come on.
Martin?
Martin.
You...
You!
Is that any way
to treat your wounded hero?
Have you got any drains or sutures?
Nup. All healed up.
Headaches?
Uh-uh.
Well, cop this.
You ratbags, get back to bed
or I'll have you on a charge.
To sum up, the ANZAC Corps will
launch a series of attacks here
at 0900 hours -
the Nek and Lone Pine.
These will cover the landing of the
two English divisions at Suvla Bay.
Do you have any comments
to the Commander-in-Chief?
Sir?
Bloody murder.
I beg your pardon?
Bloody murder.
Could you put it into language I can
convey to the Commander-in-Chief?
Right, then.
One, you ask us to commit tired troops
against a well dug in, determined enemy.
Two, every inch of that ground
is swept by fire.
Three, the objective is to draw
the Turkish reserves on us
while you land two divisions at Suvla.
Now, this can easily be accomplished
by means of raids and diversions
without the slaughter
of a full-blown attack.
Damn!
Dick and I would have been
in Queensland now.
It's a real man's world, isn't it?
Not impressed, huh?
No.
That's why I left the bush
in the first place.
That's why I like it here.
You like the war?
I like what it gives me.
A chance to run my own life.
You've got everyone from captains
to generals running your life.
You miss the point.
Nobody here gives a hoot who I am
or where I came from.
They're only interested
in how I measure up in my job.
You try that as a woman
in a country town.
What if you had good reason to go back?
Such as?
Oh, I don't know.
What say you and I got married?
Oh, Martin.
It could never happen.
People like me become mistresses
to people like you.
Not wives.
I know this war's going to
sweep away all that nonsense.
Is it?
Marty, the senior doctor tells me
he could get you
to a convalescent camp in Egypt.
No way. I'm going back to Anzac.
Why, for God's sake?
Well, look after Dick, for one thing.
Oh, blow Dick.
He can look after himself.
Who's gonna look after you?
Take the powder, bit of old shrapnel...
...just a dash of barbed wire -
rusty if possible.
Tamp it down.
Add detonator and fuse.
Voila.
Bloody marvellous.
The greatest empire in the world,
and the best it can do is a bomb in a tin.
How are you going? Still flash as a rat.
Yeah, course.
Stay where you are!
Got to keep him from the detonator.
Good to see you, Roly.
How's Kate?
Good, mate.
How's your gut?
Never mind.
What about the nurses, mate?
Is this the way to Second Brigade HQ?
Mr Murdoch.
Hello. You back already?
Martin, isn't it?
That's right.
Weren't you due for a convalescence?
Well, you know - someone's gotta
look after these blokes.
Oh. See you around, no doubt.
Yeah. Straight down that way.
Thank you.
Who's he, mate?
Keith Murdoch.
Oh, the reporter bloke.
He's not your ordinary reporter,
I tell you. I met him on Lemnos.
He's supposed to be looking into
postal arrangements for the troops.
There's more to him than meets the eye.
Yeah? Good or bad?
He's on our side.
You picked a good time to return.
The nobs are planning something.
Well, I always was lucky.
Martin, I've written a poem.
Do you want to hear it?
Yeah.
Oh, spare us, mate.
Hang on. I think the kid's
got a bit of talent.
Come on, Roly.
Go on, on the box.
Here, listen up. Follies on.
A bit of quiet for the artist.
"We've forgotten all our
manners and our talk is full of slang
"'Cause you haven't got time for
grammar when you hear the rifles bang."
Fair go.
Go on. Go on.
"The heat and flies and lice
and things has drove us nearly barmy
"So we peeled off all our clobber...
"...and we're called the naked army."
Hmm. How about morale?
It's, er... getting better.
Morning, Colonel White.
Morning, Murdoch.
How are your, er,
inquiries coming along?
They're progressing, thank you.
We had a signal
from the Commander-in-Chief.
He requests a departure date from you.
Requests or orders?
At that level it's the same thing.
He is aware, I imagine,
that I'm here at the behest
of the Australian Government.
I'm afraid the British high command
is not much preoccupied
with the wishes
of the Australian Government.
But they are quite willing
to use our troops.
I should like to stay.
At least until after the big attack.
It's not like you to be so quiet, Colonel.
It's not part of my job
to supply information to civilians.
No. But it is mine.
And to governments.
I think the Commander-in-Chief
is aware of that.
Particularly your conversations
with the 'Times' correspondent.
I see.
The high command's intelligence
is good.
I only hope their generalship
is up to the same standard.
There is a rumour that General Walker
is strongly against the attack.
He regards it
as an unnecessary sacrifice
of Australians and New Zealanders.
As a soldier,
you don't expect me to answer that.
No.
But as a civilian,
you don't expect me not to ask it.
A date, Murdoch. They want a date.
And they shall have one.
Sooner or later.
Good morning, Mrs...
Mrs Baker.
Oh, keep away from me.
Mrs Baker, I only want to have a word.
You only come round when there's
something dead in the paddock.
Mrs Baker, please.
You've got an army telegram,
haven't you?
No, I don't have any
telegrams with me today.
But I do have some news
of your son, Dick.
I thought you'd like to know.
I gather you haven't had a letter yet.
Kate, she writes like clockwork,
but Dick's not one for pen and paper.
Martin Barrington's letters
have been coming through
and he writes so much about Dick.
Well, go on, then.
Oh, please, Reverend.
For a start, it appears your son
is doing well in the army.
They've already made him a corporal.
Here, mate. You OK?
Yeah, OK.
What's it like?
It's a hell of a fight, but the boys
are in the Turkish trenches.
Yeah?
It's like a mine gone mad -
tunnels and things all over the place.
It's our luck to be a carrying party
while the others do the fighting.
Well, it suits me just fine.
So you had a long talk to Kate, eh?
Yeah, long enough.
You know, just what I told you.
You'll do the right thing by her,
won't you?
What the hell does that mean?
Well, you lot
generally get what you want.
All I was doing...
No, listen to me.
She's my sister and she's got a future.
I don't want her headed
in the wrong direction.
Yeah. And you mean my direction.
Depends on what you've got in mind.
Oh, it's a crazy subject to talk about.
No...
Two bomb carriers at the double.
Let's go.
Straight up.
The sergeant will tell you
where to go. Come on, Marty.
Besides, I'll come back and haunt you.
He won't be giving any more directions.
No.
Which way?
Let's go.
Turn.
Bloody hell.
I've got some bombs here, mate.
You cover me when I tell you?
Right.
Cover!
Arggh!
Come on, Marty.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's coming.
Come on!
Cover!
Beauty, Marty. Keep them coming.
You got 'em, Marty?
Look out. Bombs.
Go!
What the bloody hell is happening?
I don't know.
You stay here, mate. I'll have
a squizzy round the corner.
Hey, take it easy.
Dick, take it easy.
I'll be right, mate.
Dick!
Dick, you OK?
Sweet as a bun.
Well, just answer me next time, huh?
I had my hands full.
Bombs, Marty.
Take it easy.
Keep it going, Marty.
Only seconds
to the final bell, mate.
Dick!
Dick.
Dick.
Dick!
Crikey.
We heard your little shindig.
It doesn't look like
you need us now.
It was all his work.
Jeez, he must have been a goer.
I was supposed to be
protecting his back.
A mate of yours, was he?
Come on, pal.
Go back to your own mob.
You've done your share.
By the way,
the boys have taken Lone Pine.
So you've heard, huh?
I had to come just in case.
I was so close!
If only I'd looked around!
No, no.
I've seen as much death
as you have.
I know how random the chances are.
Stop it, do you hear?
Mm-hm.
It's not gonna be the same,
you know.
Nothing's gonna be the same
after all this.
May as well face up to it now.
How did you wangle this?
Oh, Harry Armstrong, bless him.
I have to go back tomorrow.
Good. Gives us some time.
Everything's measured in hours
these days.
Pat gave me some money to
buy up every luxury on the island.
You've come to the right woman.
I have this friendly Greek merchant.
No, Martin. It's enough.
Mr Lloyd George
will see you now, sir.
Come in, Mr Murdoch. How good of you
to take the time to visit me.
It's the other way around, Minister.
No, not at all.
I bring greetings
from my Prime Minister.
He says you and he
have much in common.
Apparently you both had
the good fortune to be born Welsh.
Good fortune, is it? I sometimes
wonder if it's not a cross.
Still, your Mr Hughes has the Celtic
fire in his belly, so I'm told.
I wish some of my Cabinet colleagues
had a touch of it.
You were nobbled by the military,
I hear.
Military intelligence intercepted me
at Marseilles
and relieved me of a letter I was
asked to deliver from Gallipoli.
It was written
by the 'Times' correspondent
and a number of officers.
It was highly critical
of the conduct of the campaign.
Pity. It might have pierced the fog
of military despatches.
Very strange despatches
our generals write.
They conceal what they should reveal,
like the clothes of a virtuous woman.
But I do have another letter
very like it.
Missed opportunities,
chaotic supply lines,
confusion in the medical
arrangements, incompetent staff?
Oh, this is very good, very good.
I will have it circulated
as a Cabinet document. Very good.
Good, because it will jolt
some of my colleagues.
Good, because some of us believe that
our energies should not be directed
into bungled sideshows
like Gallipoli.
But bad, too -
bad for the British cause.
We will win this war.
We HAVE to win this war.
But it will NOT be won
by fox-hunting fools
or generals whose military
imagination has fossilised
after chasing a few ragged farmers
around the South African veldt.
Sir, may I report this conversation
to the Australian Prime Minister?
Oh, you write to him, do you?
He has asked me to keep him informed
on developments in London.
You know, Murdoch, I think you and I
will get along very well together.
PAT: You blokes have never eaten
like this before, let me tell yas.
And of course,
me piece de resistance...
...damper studded with raisins,
smothered with apricot jam -
spotted dog.
Looks more like a sick cat to me.
We'll show you city blokes.
We live like kings up the bush. Mmm.
All that's missing
is a tender little leg of jumbuck.
How about a bit of Queensland goat?
I heard that. And if I recognise
the voice, you'll get nothing.
Just bear with...
Bastards!
You bastards!
Stinking rotten fly-blown
filthy mongrel of a dump!
I wouldn't swap 10 yards
of the drought-stricken Barcoo
for this whole bloody rotten
fly-blown peninsula!
And you'll be here. We'll all be here
till we're bloody old men!
You already are, you silly coot.
Oh, no.
Stuff it!
Careful, Cleary!
You could kill somebody with that!
GENERAL WALKER: Evacuation?
We are expected to get 40,000 men
off Anzac in full sight of the enemy.
Well, you're being less than
the chatterbox today, White.
Come on, man, tell me.
Is the British Army expected
to slink away like thieves in the night?
The quieter the better.
I've been working on
a feasibility study
on how we just might
avoid casualties, General.
This will need to be good, White.
Clown!
This is the third time this week
we've had a silent start.
What's it about?
There's no firing,
not even any shooting back.
I don't know, Roly.
I'll tell you what my guess is.
We're leaving.
Leaving Gallipoli?
Not quitting?
Living to fight another day.
Oh, come off it, Marty.
Can't just pack up and go.
Why not?
'Cause we don't bloody quit,
that's why not.
Who said anything about quitting?
We tried this "back door to Germany"
nonsense and it failed.
Time we went in the front door -
France.
No.
Clarke.
ROLY: After seven months
on the peninsula,
we were as keen as the heads
to break the stalemate.
We thought something funny
was happening
when we were ordered to play cricket
on the only bit of flat ground
at Anzac.
We were also acutely aware
that this place was under observation
by the Turks.
Well, it wasn't called 'Shell Green'
for nothing.
Sergeant McArthur, as usual,
took the whole thing very seriously.
We noticed he picked
all the best cricketers for his team,
leaving Martin with the also-rans
like me.
He also made Pat the umpire,
which turned out to be the worst
decision he'd made for some time.
I think Pat would've preferred
to get his two-up school going.
Righto, on your toes, boys.
Sergeant McArthur turned out
to be a very fast bowler,
but he seemed to think
it was a grudge match
between himself and Martin.
Ho, ho!
Watch your head, Marty!
Howzat?
No ball.
What do you mean, no ball?
You overstepped the mark
by a foot, son. No ball.
Uh-uh. Don't argue with the umpire.
No ball.
OK. OK.
Howzat?
How's that this time, Pat?
No ball.
No ball?!
It was a no ball last time!
Don't argue with the umpire.
You're not the umpire anymore.
Go on! Get off!
Eh?
Play cards!
You can't send the umpire off.
You. You, come on.
You get the sack,
Cleary?
You're gonna be umpire.
You see that line?
Yeah.
It's not there.
Sir.
No no balls.
You ready?!
Catch it!
Look out!
Ow!
Good hit, Marty!
without a hitch.
What was that?
The one they usually send over
at this time?
The next two nights
are the clincher.
Is it really possible
we can get them away
from under their very noses?
If everyone adheres to the plan,
we can.
It's never been done before,
you know.
The rearguard commander
is on the beach in position, sir.
Mr Armstrong.
OK, Sergeant.
Thanks for letting the originals
be the last to leave, sir.
Nobody could have done better, Roly.
Nobody could have
led us better, Harry.
Right, sir.
Well, it's time.
Thanks.
BILL: I hope they can't hear us.
Yeah.
Feel like a bloody dingo,
sneaking around in the dark.
DICK: They say it'll be over
by Christmas.
We can go to Queensland next year.
Come on, mate.
Look, if you thought of all the good
blokes we've lost, you'd go crazy.
It was a stuff-up
from the start.
Let's go, eh?
All parties on the beach now, sir,
and only two casualties.
Organisation and planning.
After nine months in Gallipoli,
our only achievement
was the way we left.
This must never happen again.
Who was that bloke, Marty?
General White.
Yeah, well, I hope
he can practise what he preaches
when we get to France -
the real war.
There's a long, long
trail a-winding
Into the land of my dreams
Where the nightingales are singing
And the pale moon beams
There's a long, long night
of waiting
Until my dreams all come true
Till the day when I'll be going
Down that long, long trail
with you.
