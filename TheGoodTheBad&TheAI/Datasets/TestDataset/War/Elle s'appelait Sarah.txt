It smells mame.
The first time she stood there.
I wanted to prove...
that "early American"...
deserved his little-loved son.
Mom, she is still alive.
That is our rich competitors.
And it is us.
Nothing to be convulsed with laughter.
- Times are tough.
- That's why...
we will imagine an ideal society...
a utopia for the 21st century.
An article on cosmetic surgery?
The naked woman can boost sales.
Let us focus on...
what the future holds good.
Biotechnology, space race.
- Positive thinking.
- From an old pessimist.
As you see.
People need to breathe.
I'm not that old.
Then the Middle East for Obama.
I leave that to the London office.
What else? Ah yes...
The daughter of deported...
against the state and the SNCF.
She won?
Yes. Chirac's speech at the Vel d'Hiv...
- Has borne fruit.
- On what?
Het Vel d'Hiv.
How do you spell that?
- You're kidding.
- What happened?
In July 1942...
Especially women and children.
A horror.
The Superdome in New Orleans...
- A thousand times worse.
- At least.
Afterwards, they were sent
in the camps.
You're well informed.
Time Magazine...
I was entitled to half a sheet.
So now I want 10 pages.
Ten? I can not, Julia.
Our readers love the story.
Most are unaware of this history.
Young apologize.
So an old indoor velodrome?
Very beautiful. Where is it?
- Shaved 50 years ago.
- Photos?
Not precisely.
no bed, no toilets and little water.
- And not an image.
- There is one.
Buses in front of the entrance. That's it.
It's weird.
The Nazis filmed everything.
It is well known.
Mike...
There were the French.
A street like others.
No trace of the past.
There is a plaque, bld. Grenelle...
and a statue quai de Grenelle.
But the entrance to the Vel d'Hiv was good here?
My God, where will we?
At Pitchipoï, they say.
No, Beaune-la-Rolande.
Those attending will be released Pithiviers.
Believe what you want...
but ultimately to Germany or Poland.
Finally, wherever you go...
is the same, here we go again.
You see this ring?
It contains poison.
Nobody tells me when I die.
Person.
It is not dangerous to your age?
I will do an amniocentesis.
You can have a miscarriage.
Or be mowed down by a bus.
Why are you doing this?
You have suffered enough.
Because I feel it.
And if Bertrand supports me, that's okay.
Yes, if you support...
It does not tell him anything, dirty diapers...
and sleepless nights.
You're too old.
Thank you. It helps a lot.
Then this story apartment?
They have stolen?
No, like the Marais...
the Lower East Side.
Jewish immigrants were renting.
Bertrand thinks what?
I have not had the courage to tell him.
You are New Yorker and a fighter.
Do what you gotta do.
Easy to say.
Wladyslaw and Rywka Starzynski.
Executed at Auschwitz in 1942.
Not Sarah or Michael...
on any list of prisoners...
Poland or Drancy.
They had to flee.
You're a stubborn.
You would not do?
They can be anywhere.
They may be alive.
You want them to make room?
Why not?
Do not wake the sleeping cat.
My stepfather.
I'm sure they knew it.
They told you that?
I do not know how to ask them.
It's very simple:
Call them and ask them.
We will put the video online.
Nice speech,
that person will return.
His words made noise at the time.
Your article is amazing, Julia.
Say that it happened right in Paris.
It is to vomit.
What would you have done?
How?
How do you know...
what you have done?
I watched it on TV...
as civilian casualties in Iraq.
Please, Mike.
- What it makes?
- No idea.
Mom? Who's that?
I try to find it.
I'll tell you.
You'd think if it was serious?
Of course, my angel.
Do not worry.
You're there. I tried
to join you.
I cut my phone.
- I'm glad to see you.
- Me too.
Bertrand phoned.
He is worried.
What is it?
You did?
You have to talk to him.
We miss them too.
- I should come more often.
- Yes.
So you found?
An idiot would have found on the Internet.
There are five Rainsferd in Brooklyn.
To you find the right one.
What are you gonna find?
I do not know.
Someone.
I am looking for Sarah or Richard Rainsferd.
Not know.
Thank you.
I am looking for Richard and Sarah Rainsferd.
No Richard or Sarah here.
And in your family?
No, I'm sorry.
Sorry, you are
Richard Rainsferd?
Bob Rainsferd.
Do you know Sarah or Richard?
No, sorry.
Thank you.
Now, we'll...
You want?
I am looking for Ms. Rainsferd, but...
My mother is out.
You're a friend?
No, I know people
his family.
- In Europe?
- Yes, Europe.
You live in Manhattan?
In Paris. But I grew up here.
Paris is the most beautiful city in the world.
- Your mother said that?
- She speaks of Rome.
Excuse me.
We'll be there all day.
The nurse from my father.
It will not be long.
Is he ill? Sorry.
Mom is very strong.
She cheers up everyone.
It's her. I'll help.
That was in 1966.
Surely a tire that exploded.
The truck driver said
she swerved...
and he could not avoid it.
I met Richard two years later.
At first he did not remarry.
It was as if...
he wanted to be the husband of Sarah.
But years have passed...
and he eventually changed his mind.
And that's it.
Their son lives in Italy.
A son?
William, my half-brother.
He was nine years...
when Sarah had her accident.
Then, it was difficult.
But I like high
my own son.
I taught him to love Italy...
to eat pasta.
And he met a woman...
the village where I was born.
He never returned.
He lives in Florence now.
It did him good from here...
and rebuild his life in Europe.
It is the nurse. I go there.
Can I see your husband?
I do not know if it
a good idea...
to revisit all those things.
He is very ill.
I understand.
And his son?
Mom, answer me.
You have a lover?
Of course not.
But you'll leave Dad.
I never said that.
He told you that?
No, but why...
you're gone suddenly
Florence?
My darling...
It's much more complicated.
I go tomorrow...
and we'll talk.
And the baby...
You should have told me.
That concerns me too.
I know, I'm sorry.
- You do not want this baby?
- I say that.
I wish I had
a little brother.
Or sister.
But I will not change
its layers.
I love you, choupinette.
What do you drink?
Water, it will be perfect.
You want dinner?
Just drink something.
Water and a glass of Brunello.
You are a journalist. I investigated.
And write on
Tuscan cuisine.
My book is responsible for...
those extra pounds that I can not lose.
What can I do for you?
You're too young...
to have known my mother.
I am family Tézac.
- Who?
- The Tézac.
Sorry, I do not say anything.
They have taken...
Apartment rue de Saintonge...
after the family
Your mother...
My stepfather,
Edward Tézac was there...
when they found your uncle Michael.
I have no uncle.
The brother of your mother.
She had no brother.
Rue de Saintonge tells me nothing.
Maybe you
the wrong person.
Your mother's name Sarah?
Yes, Sarah Rainsferd.
And before that Sarah Dufaure.
And Starzynski, it means nothing to you?
Starzynski? No.
You made this trip for nothing.
Sorry.
There must be another Sarah.
What did you tell the son of...
You recognize?
It is impossible. Not...
There is a little resemblance, but...
This is not my mother.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
My mother was not...
Jewish.
You want what?
You came to say...
that my mother had another name?
She was a victim
of this tragedy?
Sorry. I'm
Did you know.
It's madness.
My mother was French.
Sarah Dufaure.
She had no brother.
She never lived in Paris.
- You're wrong.
- Let me...
tell you everything.
No, I do not know.
This is important.
Let me be clear.
I do not want to talk about that.
And I do not want to see you again.
Please do not call me.
Enjoy your stay in Florence.
- Hello, Dad.
- William...
You should not be
with your family?
No, my place is here.
You saw this reporter, right?
One that tells the story silly.
Sit down, William.
- I'll help you.
- Sit down.
You mean all this is true?
Yes?
I remember...
the first time I saw your mother.
It was in a dance hall in Manhattan.
I noticed two things.
The first...
It was the most beautiful woman...
I had never seen.
The second...
Behind his smile...
she seemed to hide something.
We spent a good time.
But I guess...
she felt uncomfortable.
It was the saddest person...
I had never met.
I tried to erase this sadness.
But it was impossible.
It was not an accident.
His accident...
was not an accident.
You mean she killed herself?
- Papa!
- Listen...
She was increasingly depressed.
All drugs, alcohol...
As if she had a shadow in her...
who never stopped growing.
You want some?
- You do not say anything?
- No. Continues.
We had terrible fights...
about your identity.
What you had...
or ought not to know.
It was agreed on anything.
She had taken precautions.
Just after you were born...
she left the hospital...
for you to be baptized at the church.
I left work for the ceremony.
For her, if you were Jewish...
your life was in danger.
It's...
irrational, of course...
Everything is there.
What's this?
We never talked about...
but she wanted this.
Why do not you tell me?
Why you waited...
I have fifty?
I had no strength.
My whole life is a lie.
William, my boy...
You are what happened to me better.
We are all products of our history.
Yours is in these pages.
Go, my son. Do not be afraid.
What is it?
William?
Julia?
Sorry.
Even in France,
we shake hands.
- What's your name, princess?
- Lucy.
Nice to meet you, Lucy.
It's a tourist trap.
But I had often
here with my mother.
The sight fascinated her.
So...
You live here long?
About a year.
You are left?
Sorry, I did not want to be indiscreet.
- You've chosen?
- A hot chocolate.
The Dufaure have kept everything.
It's incredible.
They have been so happy...
meet you.
Was mutual.
I realized with these books...
I did not know my mother.
I knew his face...
her smile, her perfume.
But I knew nothing of her.
His doubts, his fears, his dreams.
And here I am: 40 years later...
trying to make his acquaintance.
Thank you for coming.
After Italy, I was very depressed.
It was a selfish...
pry into the lives of others...
to stir memories...
and even judge people.
By what right?
So: thank you.
No, I thank you.
Thanks to you, my father died in peace.
- And now?
- I do not know.
Weird, I needed to come back.
But I feel like a stranger.
France influenced me the most
I thought.
Perhaps I will return to Paris.
My eldest daughter does not like it here.
And I want the little...
way his father when he sees fit.
She is adorable
your little Lucy.
Lucy is the name of the giraffe.
Her name then how?
Sarah.
Excuse me.
It is I who am sorry.
Thank you.
