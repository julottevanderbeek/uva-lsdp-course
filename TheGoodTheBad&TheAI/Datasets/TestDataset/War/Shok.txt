Stupid kids.
Move it.
You go ahead.
I'll make my own way.
- Get back in the car.
- Just go.
Hurry up.
Petrit, I don't want to crash.
I only just got this bike.
Come on.
We don't want to be late.
Petrit, we shouldn't
even be here.
Just keep your mouth shut
and stay out of sight.
Let me do what I do.
Boy.
What do you want?
I'm Petrit.
Oh, you're Petrit.
Well?
These are for you.
Good boy.
Good.
Now go. Quickly.
Cheers.
Petrit, I want to go now.
This is for you.
What's that for?
For letting me borrow
your bicycle.
Come on.
Do you want to stay over?
Come on. It will be fun.
We can ride to school tomorrow.
Hundreds of tanks,
trucks and buses
full of Serbian forces...
Where have you been?
For a bike ride.
Oki bought a bike.
Tell him.
It's true. I've been selling
almonds. It took me a year to save up.
Leave them be.
But they must be back
before the curfew.
You can't be seen on the streets
at this hour.
Understand?
Is Oki staying for dinner?
Actually,
he's going to stay over tonight.
Then we can ride to
school together.
As long as his family knows.
..where many people have been
killed and massacred...
I've got another meeting
after school.
Are you coming with me?
I'll pay you.
I don't know.
It's not safe.
It's fine. They are my friends.
Plus they need me.
Supply and demand.
It's business.
And in a few weeks,
I'll be able to buy my own bike.
You can't trust them.
You have heard the stories.
Remember what happened to Nehat?
Let me show you something.
What is it?
Open it.
See, I told you you're
safe with me.
With Luli i Vocerr he shows the
misery of the Albanians.
Are you coming, then?
OK.
I'll see you later, yeah?
Yes?
- We're looking for Dragan.
- Dragan?
Let him through.
You brought a friend, I see.
He's my business partner.
Partner? Really?
Leave.
Hey, partner.
That's a nice bicycle.
Thank you.
Look at me when I'm
talking, boy.
My nephew would like a bicycle.
What I want to know is why Albanian
scum are riding around on a bike
while my Serbian nephew
has to go without.
Is this justice?
Well?
Oki.
Give him your bicycle.
I'm sorry, Oki.
There was nothing I could do.
- I'll buy you a new one.
- I don't want anything from you.
Especially something bought
with money from them.
What will my family say?
They will be so ashamed.
We can make an excuse
about the bike.
Not about the bike!
It's not about the bike.
Understand?
It's that we've been
dealing with them.
You're no businessman.
You're a coward,
you're a liar,
but most of all,
you're a traitor.
I'm sorry, Oki.
How many times can I say it?
Please, it's been days now.
Cut the engine.
You. Both of you.
Boy, get out.
Out. Out.
What's this?
Take it and get out.
Quickly.
What are you looking at?
Get out.
Hurry up.
- Come on.
- Hurry.
Give it to me.
What are these?
You're carrying Kosovan books?
You're learning in Albanian?
This land is not part
of Albania.
Understand? This is Serbia.
- How dare you look at me!
- Wait!
They are my books.
What?
- They are mine.
- Silence!
Him.
Tomorrow, I want to see Serbian
books and hear you sing in Serbian!
You, come on!
Come on!
What are you doing here?
I came to say thanks.
You didn't need to do that.
Yes, I did.
You were right.
I can't trust them.
I'm not going to sell any more.
To them I'll always be
"Albanian scum".
Plus I don't really need a bike.
Me neither.
Do you want to stay over?
Mum is making a Pita.
Yeah.
Stay there. Don't move!
Come on! Come on!
Get out!
Come on!
Quickly! Move!
Where shall we start?
With the boy, I think.
Boy, step forward.
Boy.
Do you want to save him?
You want to save him?
Enough!
That's enough.
Enough.
Well?
This is not your country.
Take your possessions.
Leave and do not look back.
If you look back...
..we will kill you.
Is that clear?
Motherfuckers.
Go.
Go.
Go.
