Welcome, sir
pritam Singh is a very good man
and a respected veteran
It's officers like you
that have taught me all I know
We should get going now
Hail India
- Jai Hind
This is the last Indian village
before the Line of Control
Soopra village
Hello
- Hello
Where are you from?
Delhi
The Capital
I'm from Maliyabad
Ever heard of it?
- Yes, sir
When was that?
Just now sir, from you!
This highway goes along
the river from Srinagar to Leh
It's the only link
between Kashmir and Ladakh
You see those mountains?
The LOC is behind that range
and across it are pakistani posts
You'll see it today
Everything okay here?
- Yes, sir. Nothing to worry
Where's Capt. Ravindran?
- In the bunker, sir
Allright, carry on
Do you see the pakistani
post over there?
Wow! Unbelievable
That pillar marks the LOC
and from here to there
is no man's land...
Not ours Not theirs
Even so, we exchange
fire almost every day
If there's firing
we also retaliate
That's amazing
It's like I've always known,
but somehow...
I've never felt this Indian before
I'm an Indian
I still remember seeing
these borders for the first time
I understand how you must feel
Come, let's go
I have been moved by
the affection and hospitality...
...extended to me...
...and the delegation
of eminent persons...
...who accompanied me
jammu and Kashmir is one
of the issues...
...we are discussing...
...within the framework of
our composite dialogue
You were watching our live
telecast from the Wagah border
This is a historic day
Today, India and pakistan
can hope that these steps...
will bridge the distance
that has long divided us
Stay tuned for the news
in English, Thank you
Out. - Guruvindhar, was that okay?
- Perfect
Romila, call for you
Thank you
Hi Rajiv, tell me?
I've to read the news at 8,
lets meet after that
Okay, bye
Thanks
This must be special
- What do you mean?
I mean, we met by chance
kept running into each other
and now we're more than good friends
There must be something special
- perhaps
How about getting married?
What do you think?
Rajiv, its very sweet of you
We're friends, why not
leave it at that?
Do you plan on marrying
someone you hate?
Look, it's not like you
don't know me or don't like me...
I hope
- Of course I like you
You know it
Then what's the problem?
I haven't thought about marriage
So give it a thought now
Okay, say you'll think of it
Or is it asking too much?
No, it's not that
I'll think about it
Hi mom
When did you come?
- A little while ago
Dinner?
- I've eaten
What're you reading?
Have a lecture at 9 tomorrow,
just making some notes
Rajiv asked me to marry him
What did you say?
What should I have said?
I think... whatever it was
you and Karan shared
...it's in the past?
It's something like that
What do you think?
You can't spend the
rest of your life in mourning
That's true but...
But what?
Nothing
Come on! Come on
Good shot
Well done Karan! Well done
Come on! Come on
Hello sir
- Hi Karan
You see that?
Sir
The snow is melting
Summer is here
How cold does it get
up there in winter, sir?
Minus forty degree, minus fifty degree
- Really
Yes, it's difficult to stay up there
Both, the pakistanis and
we vacate our posts in winter
It's like a gentleman's pact
that neither of us will
take advantage of this
Once the weather changes,
we man our posts again
I'd like to go there, sir
Someday you'll have to
Check
- Check
Sure you aren't a cousin of our
Grandmaster vishwanath Anand?!
Good morning sir
- Hey morning
Coffee?
Why not?
Ashok, another cup please?
- Yes, sir
from home
Do you like mangoes?
- Sir?
Mangoes?
I like them
Ever eaten mangoes from Maliyabad?
I will if you get them, sir
The fun lies in eating
them fresh at the orchard
Hey, Mishra!
Want to come home and eat
mangoes next season?
You plan this every year
but never take me there!
I wonder if he really has
any orchards at all!
Come on! It's your move
Check!
- Again?!
Why don't you...
Hey Karan...
Isn't she the girl whose
picture is in your wallet?
What happened? A tiff?
Excuse me sir
Hey Rajiv
- Hi brother
What's up?
Where you coming from?
There
Where's Romi?
She's busy preparing
for tomorrow's protest march
protest match? Again!?
Okay friends, the pamphlets are here
Now our volunteers must be at
every gate by 7 in the morning
Okay?
- We'll be there
Every student should
be given one, Okay?
And please ask them to read it
pamphlets are meant to be read
Is this poster okay?
Good
Where are the Hindi posters?
Almost complete Don't worry
Okay I'm going home
Call me if you need anything
Or tomorrow at 7 A. M, okay?
Hi Karan
What's going on?
Preparation for the march
put up posters opposite
the vice Chancellor's office...
...this very night, okay?
No more of the vice
Chancellor's dictatorship!
No more! No more!
Uncle, be honest...
Are all these rallies and
demonstrations of any use?
Everyone has a right
to speak out in a democracy
But you shouldn't disrupt
law and order
Law and order? Hello aunty!
Hello Karan?
- How are you?
I am fine!
Where's Romi?
- In her room, Aunty
Sit please
The police resorted to using
water cannons at the last rally
Water cannons! She was lucky to
get away... or else she'd be in jail
Like mother like daughter!
I remember being arrested
in my student years
Aunty! Under arrest!!
Akhilesh...
- Yes?
I'm going to the
India International Centre
Okay - Bye... bye Karan
- Bye aunty - Bye
So tell me, what are your plans?
I'm going home right now
Then I'm meeting
my friends this evening...
I don't mean your agenda for today
I'm talking about life
Life...!?
You mean life!
Right uncle! It's worth a thought
You know...
Whatever you do in life,
it's very important to do it well
You can become a scientist...
but what's the use
if you aren't a good scientist?
Mow lawns, if thats
what you want to do
as long as you do it well
Do you agree?
You're right, uncle
Anyway, I should get going
Aren't you waiting for Romi?
No problem! I'll call her later
Has Karan gone?
- Yes, he had to leave
That boy is very confused
That's his only problem, papa
He just can't decide
what he wants to do
His life doesn't have...
what's it called...?
An objective
Thats it! Objective!
He has no real objective
But wait and watch,
the day he finds his calling
...you'll see how far he goes
Your juice, sir
Switch on the geyser, will you?
Do meet them
they're good people
You're in philadelphia
now and they are too
Sridhar, breakfast
- Don't mix them!
Put the clean ones aside!
You're mixing them again!!
You should keep in touch
with family friends, son
Is that Udesh? Give me
the phone, please
You've know them
since you were a child
just a second, mom!
It's important give it to me
Yes!
- Mom
Here! Just speak to Karan first!
Udesh! Can you check if the
jurassic park DvD is available
just check! It must be
just courier it to me,
okay, talk to mom
Hold on, Udesh... please
go speak to your father
About what?!
He wants to speak to you
About what?!!
Hi dad
- Hi
You haven't gone to the office today?
I usually don't on Sunday's
Oh! Is it Sunday?
How would you know?
Sunday, Monday,
it's all the same to you!
Are you going to do
anything in life?
Of course I will, dad
But whatever I do, it's very
important to do it well
I could become a scientist...
but what's the use if
I'm not a good scientist?
Mow lawns, if thats
what I want to do
as long as I do it well
That's what I feel about life
That's good
But just thinking won't help,
you have to do things
Udesh is just two years
elder to you, look at him!
Parvesh, tell me something
parents, especially fathers...
Why do they always
ask the same thing?
What do you want to be?
What do you want to do?
Isn't there any other topic?
Who'll ask, if not fathers?
Mine is reverse!
I've told my parents I'm doing hotel
management before they could ask me
Girls have become
very sensible today!
Look at Romi!
She's been clear about wanting
to be a journalist all along
please, her father's the editor
of a leading daily
What problem would
she have becoming a journalist!?
What're you saying?
Whatever Romi decides
to do, she will do well
She's really different
and really smart
How could I forget who I'm talking to!?
I'm sorry lover boy
Romi is a genius!
Guess what, guys?
I haven't told my parents
yet but I've decided
What?
- Army
Army?
You! Join the army! You'll be
court-martialed the first day!
Ever woken up before noon?
I will when I need to!
Why should I for no reason!
You want to be an engineer
Did I ever say you won't make it?
Calm down!
Why are you over reacting?
Because you always put me down
But think about it,
buddy Army life isn't easy
Nothing is easy in the world
But I've decided and
that's that! I'm joining the army
I feel my country needs me!
Aren't Army uniforms
the smartest, Ashu?
You guys are giving me a complex!
You're joining the army,
you engineering...
you, hotel management
I'm the only one left!
Sometimes I think I'll do
this, sometimes that!
Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I the way I am?
When did I ever know
what I am supposed to do?
Looks like I'll be singing
this song all my life
What will happen to me?
Will someone please tell me?
Why is it so difficult?
Will someone help me understand?
Why am I like this?
Why am I the way I am?
Now I feel like doing this,
but then again it's that
But why? I just don't know...
What it is that I must do!
What now looks clear and simple...
Tomorrow will seem all twisted
I feel like my life is...
- Completely upside down!
Will I ever change?
Will I ever believe?
Will I ever improve?
I don't know if I will
What's to become of me now?
What do you think?
What's to become of me now?
Will I just remain the way I am?
When did I ever know
what I am supposed to do?
Looks like I'll be singing
this song all my life
What will happen to me?
Will someone please tell me?
Why is it so difficult?
Will someone help me understand?
Why am I like this?
It's just the way I am!
I don't know why
you are the way you are
You think about it
Don't you get bored?
Where's the time to get bored?
There's so much going on
in the world...
...if a person is interested,
how can he get bored!!
Yeah I know
You are right
How come a girl like you
is into someone like me?
Why do you love me?
You want to be praised, is it?
Seriously...
I've never seen you
behave small or petty
I've never heard
you talk badly of someone
I respect that about you
I like that
- Really?
You're a good, big hearted person
that's why I love you
Thanks
Know what I think?
You're not too bad yourself!
Shut up Karan
Your juice, sir
Switch on the geyser, will you?
- Yes
Hello Aunty! Is parvesh home?
What happened?
Romi, you always
say that I keep drifting
That my life lacks a...
An objective
The world is objective
- Exactly
Objective! Now listen...
It's all clear to me now
I'm joining the army
You will join the army!?
Are you serious?
Romi, I've decided and that's that!
I'm joining the army!
I feel my country needs me
We all must do something
for our country
But when do we ever
realise our responsibility!
I have realised it!
The IMA is in Dehradun
Indian Military Academy
I have filled out the form
There's a written exam first...
If I pass, there'll be an
interview and a medical test
I'm sure to be selected
By the way, guess
who's coming with me?
Parvesh!
I'm really stressed, man!
Remember we had applied
to IMA last month?
Yes, so?
I got the letter today, for
the exam, didn't you get it?
Maybe, I'll check at home, why?
I don't want to go!
Don't want to go!!!
What are you saying?
I applied because of you
I told you, this guy in the army?
He gets up at noon!
That's not the point!
My dad told me...
If I do an MBA from any
American university...
...I can get a job the
very next day in the U.S.
I can't believe you're off
to the U.S. Now!
What'll I do alone in the army?
Man! He's so unreliable!
Tell me something...
How many years does
it take to an MBA in America?
What is this?
What is this?
Did you apply to the IMA?
Are you planning to
sit for the exam?
Actually parvesh and...
Did you ask us before
making this decision?
Answer me! Did you ask
me or your mother?
You've lost your mind!
Think you can do
whatever you feel like?
Not in this house!
You better understand that!
But Daddy, what have I...
- Shut up
I've had enough!
Shalini, it's all our fault
He gets whatever he wants!
I'm here to earn the money!!
Where's the need for
him to do anything?
Apart from his regular nonsense
Now see this...
he wants to join the army!
Karan, look at me...
You will do as I say
Understand that! You will
do exactly as I say!
Enough is enough
He's very upset
What's gotten into you!
Just see how Udesh...
please mummy, I am not Udesh!
Karan, don't feel so bad yeah
parents say things they
shouldn't when they're upset
But they don't really mean it
How do I know that?
I hear what you say...
and I see what you do
Do you remember how in school...
...both your parents
would come on parents Day
My mom would, but did you
even once see my Dad?
You will do as I say!
...sorry, but I won't!
I want to join the army and I will!!
If you're serious,
then don't listen to anybody
Do what your heart tells you
But if you're being
stubborn or egoistic
because your father
has said not to
then this would be a wrong decision
No, Romi, it's not about
being stubborn or egoistic
I want to join the army
So! It's decided then
Now cheer up
Come on... come on...
My God! I never knew you could get
so angry!
I am really scared now
How did it go?
Romi, I'm sad I can't
show you my papers
There's just one fear
What's that?
I hope they don't think
I've copied everything
...because every answer
is just perfect!
Very good
Now that it's clear
what my future is...
other thoughts are
brewing in my mind
Like what?
Like, in a couple of years I'll have to
get married... So what do you say?
About what?
About marriage!
Karan, I knew that someday
we'd discuss marriage
But I never thought you'd
say it in this manner!
How should I say it?
I mean...
Can't you be more romantic?
I see
So you'd like me to...
...get you flowers...
...gaze into your eyes and say...
Don't be stupid
I didn't say that
But it could've been
said in a nicer way - Really!
If I say that I'm in love with you
you are my only desire
what will you say?
If I say that I'm in love with you
you are my only desire
what will you say?
I will say...
that if you had said it
with a little more panache
and a little more charm
It would be nice
If I say
that you are as fresh
as morning dew
Your lips as luscious
as flower petals...
Your eyes twinkle like fireflies...
that my heart beats faster
when I think of you...
If I say
If I say
that the moon is pale in
comparison to your beauty
What will you say?
I will say...
please don't compare
me to the moon
it has many blemishes
And not a flower either
they wither and wilt
As for fireflies... they just
vanish without a trace
If you'd stop using cliche's
and say it in a style
unique and original
and with a little more charm
It would be nice
If I say that I'm in love with you
you are my only desire
what will you say?
If I say
you have confused
me with your answers
How should I say
what I have to say?
Nothing I say seems to please you
Because I think you
don't even believe me!
If I say
If I say
Why is it that you don't know...
...that you already have my love?
I will say...
My heart does say
we are meant to be together
If we truly feel it
in both our hearts
then words don't matter
Don't worry, Shalini,
let him go if he wants!
He'll be back in no time,
i'm absolutely sure of it
But I'm really amazed
that he got selected!
Gentlemen Cadets...
I, Adjutant of the I.M. A,
Lt. Col. Pratap Singh...
...welcome you to the academy
Today, you are
stepping into a new life
And I expect, that with
every passing day...
...you will prove worthy of
this great institution
Know that you are here
because you are special
The Indian Military Academy
is a great institution
...who's commitment cannot
be praised in just words
first, our country...
second, the army...
then, his unit
and finally, concern for himself...
...that is the trademark of
an I.M. A trained officer
Gentlemen cadets you must preserve
the honor and traditions of IMA
So, good luck to all of you
Gentlemen, there are three basic
rules in handling a weapon
One, a strong grip
Two, a focussed mind
Three, precise trigger operation
You will now learn how
to acquire a strong grip
Karan shergill
- Yes, Sergeant
Detail, get ready to charge!
Charge!
Attack!
Stab!
Draw!
Hit!
Cut!
Charge!!
Detail, get ready to charge!
Charge
What's the matter?
Where's your energy?
Didn't your mother feed you?
You need to have fire in the belly!
Move out of line and
watch the others
Come on, move fast
Next
Detail, get ready to charge
Why're you scared?
He's getting nervous for
no reason, it's very easy
You're next, we'll see
All right, Rakesh my boy!
I'll wave to you from the top
very bad fail
You had to do it in a minute, next!
Go up, cross and jump,
all in a minute! - Sir
Make it fast
Sergeant!
- Yes, sir?
All well?
- Under control, sir
Good carry on
- Yes sir
Gentleman cadet Karan Shergill
- Yes sir
You fell because you
were not concentrating
Do you think you can get away
for lack of discipline? - No sir
You shall be punished!
- Yes sir
You will crawl in that trench,
no stopping till I say so!
Now, go
You guys think it's a joke!
How do you like
the taste of mud, eh?
Don't get up, go again
Move it! Fast!
Hands low G.C.!!
It's not easy becoming
an officer, is it?
Come on, hurry up!
Don't get up
Hurry up
Come on
Hurry up
Come on, move
Don't get up you will
stay on your knees all day
Is that understood?
- Yes sir
What are you thinking?
- Nothing much
Let it go, man!
It was just bad luck the
Company Commander came by
And you did give him
reason to punish you
Now forget everything
and get some sleep
Tomorrow is a fresh start
Don't give anyone
a chance to punish you
Okay? See you in the morning
- Good night
Karan, Saket said goodnight,
at least wish him!
Good night
Did you get into a fight there?
No... I just...
Sit down
Whatever I have earned, acquired...
All that I have...
who do you think it's for?
What did he bring with him?
My entire family stayed
in one small room
When I grew up, I'd hear of
the house we had in Lahore...
...the status our family had...
This would pierce
my heart like an arrow
I vowed that...
I would restore the family
position to what it once was
And I succeeded
But my father didn't live to see this
Now all I have is my family
and if you have no respect
for what I have done
then all my effort
has been in vain
You must help him, son
Start going to the office
from tomorrow, okay?
All right, go
Didn't I tell you he'll
be back in no time
I know him Shalini,
he's good for nothing
Let it be now
At least he's back
Only you expect anything from him
I fail to understand...
Why Karan can't be more like Udesh
What's this?
You arrived yesterday
but called me today!
Nice hair style
Anyway, how long are you here for?
I'm not going back
- What do you mean?
You ran away, didn't you!?
For once you had made
your own decision
only to be defeated
in a few days
Your parents were upset
But you said "It's my life,
I'll decide what I want"
Is this what you decided?
I can understand
you're annoyed, but...
What do you understand, Karan?
Remember, it was here that
you said... you wanted to marry me
perhaps even that decision
has changed!
What are you saying, Romi!
- What should I say!?
When someone can't respect
himself or his own decision...
How can I expect him to respect me?
Please listen to...
- Don't touch me
I don't think I ever
want to meet you again
You accept that you have done wrong
You accept that you have
disgraced this institution
please answer yes or no?
- Yes sir
Are you ready for any punishment
given to you? - Yes sir
Your act was
not a minor misdemeanor
You will undergo a
After that, your plea
will be considered - Yes sir
Say it loud and clear
- Yes sir
This is your path...
You know it now
This is your dream...
You realise it now
This is your path...
You know it now
This is your dream...
You realise it now
Now you have to prove it
Nothing can hinder you or stop you
You will fulfill your objective
Your objective...
must be achieved at any cost
When you walk with your
heart full of courage
The ground will tremble
beneath your feet
Distances will not matter
Your goal will step
forth and embrace you
When you walk with your
heart full of courage
The ground will tremble
beneath your feet
Stride forth, day or night
It's not for you to rest or stop
You will fulfill your objective
Your objective... must be
achieved at any cost
This is your path...
You know it now
This is your dream...
You realise it now
Now you have to prove it
You are now officers
of The Indian Army
Congratulations
- Thanks mom
Udesh had called
He said to salute you on his behalf
Typical Udesh
Your father did want to be here
But an important meeting
came up at the last minute
It's okay, I understand

Congratulations
And once these stars

I'll be an officer too
Lt. Karan Shergill
The enemy's worst nightmare!
I will do my duty...
honestly & faithfully...
serve in the regular army...
of the union of India...
and go wherever ordered...
by land...
sea...
or air...
and that...
I will observe & obey...
all commands...
of the president...
of the union of India...
and...
the Commands of...
any officer...
set over me...
even to the prior of my life
Welcome once again to
"To each his own view"
for those who have just tuned in...
our topic for today is...
Today's Woman in the
eyes of Today's Man
Mr. Trivedi, you were
saying before the break
Yes, first and foremost...
Woman is a mother,
wife and homemaker
If you try changing her role
it will cause an upheaval in her
life and in society
It's okay, it's your belief
We'll come back to you
Mr. Rajiv Kohli you are
a business executive
Do you agree with him?
- No, I don't agree with him
Today in the corporate or creative world
or any field, for that matter
Women are not only matching
strides with men...
but are gradually going ahead
No, don't clap, it's a fact
Today's woman is a success story
A shining example is with us today
Miss Romila Dutta

Reports of intrusion are
coming in from Drass
Intruders have also crossed
the LOC into Kaksar and Batalik
Regretable thing is that
after returning from Lahore
prospects to peace is
rendered impossible
Oh my God!
What's this new problem?
Hi mom
Where have you been all evening?
Come in
What's this news from Kargil?
You're posted there, aren't you?
What news? I haven't heard anything
Really? There was something
on the T. V about it
Hello
just a moment!
It's for you
Hello
Sir!
Lt. Shergill here Sir
Yes sir
Sir
Right Sir
My leave is cancelled
But what's happened?
You just got here!
It's this news, isn't it?
What did he say?
That I should report back at once
He must have said more!
What are you hiding?
I don't have anything
to tell you, Dad!?
I've to go
Due to commencement of Operation vijay
you are being made an Acting Captain
Army Intelligence has reported that
our neighbours... have betrayed our trust
They have crossed the Line
of Control and infiltrated...
regions from Batalik to
Drass with armed intruders
Our unit is responsible for peak 5179
I've called for a briefing
in the next 15 minutes
Come what may,
we must recapture peak 5179
At any cost!
This is the mountain known
as peak 5179 on the map
We cannot access it's northern side...
without crossing the LOC
And we have been given
precise orders...
that under no circumstances,
can we cross the LOC So!
That leaves us with three sides
The western side is a sheer cliff
The enemy has a natural defense here
That leaves two sides
This is the southern side, facing us
But there's open plain
from here to there
No cover at all
The enemy perched on the mountain...
can easily watch our
movements from his bunker upto 3 km
This means that we are left with
only one option the eastern side
That's right
We will send a small team
They must move undetected and explore
and chart possible routes
that will provide us...
with maximum cover
There!
Their bunkers must
be across that ridge line
That's the only access to this side
They would've definitely covered it
Hello, Ghaznavi 1
Hello, Ghaznavi 3, come in, over
Sir, I can see Indian soldiers
one and half kms away
A patrolling party, perhaps
No firing
Don't reveal your position
Understood, sir, over
Karan, get back!
Why were you in the open?
- Sorry, sir
I felt a presence on the mountain
I felt like I was being watched
Come on, get the camera, quick!
Come on... come on... hurry up
Hey, isn't that Romila Dutta?
You're right
Hello
- Hi!
How far is that shelling from here?
- About 3 kms away
The pakistanis on the mountain...
...are trying to cut off the highway
I see
- Don't worry, they won't succeed
Where are you going? - Kargil
Actually we are from Global news
You don't need an introduction!
Hi
Hello
Hi
The shelling you hear
is from the other side
Our Artillery will see where best
to retaliate and then fire back
In mountain warfare...
the side occupying the
heights holds the advantage
Therefore! Before any attack on
the feature's eastern side...
we need to know...
the exact position of
the enemy's bunkers
The strength of their fire power
An aggressive patrol will
be sent to accomplish this
What's the plan, sir?
Thank you sir
four teams! The first from this side
You will lead it Second team, Kaushal
- Yes sir
You will apply pressure onto this area
Third team, Satish and Capt. Ramanna
You will go till here
And Akbar, Karan & Sgt. Dharamvir Singh
You will position your team here
and open fire
This will not be an actual attack
but they should feel that it is real
When they return fire... we'll get to know
their positions and weapons
Yes sir
Engagement ring! - Congratulations
- Thank you.
Alright! Here we go...
Ready pradeep
- Yes sir
All teams open fire!
Sir, Oscar Tango 3 degrees,
distance 800 metres
they have a medium machine gun
Here! NW of team D!
Sir!
Hello Tiger!
This is team 2 here
Hello tiger, there's a bunker
on the Camel's Hump
Bunker on the Camel's Hump?
Okay vinodh!
Hello Tiger - Go ahead Koushal
- A bunker! On the landing!
Bunker on the landing, mark it!
Oscar Tango 23 degrees,
distance 650 metres
There's a bunker on the ridge
On the ridge! Return to base
All teams return to base...
Mission accomplished...
I repeat, Mission accomplished
They have a medium and light
machine gun in these bunkers
There are 4 bunkers up there
And they have an 81 mm
Mortar at the top of this feature
Sir...
- Yes, pritam Singh, go on
They have two 81 mm mortars
up there, not one
It takes at least 10 seconds
to reload this weapon...
but the second round comes
in well before that
He's right
Now that's experience
Hello
Sir, we pushed them back
- You fool!
They came to check out our bunkers
and weapons... and succeeded!
Stay prepared and alert
The real attack isn't too far now! Over!
Understood, sir! Over!
Yesterday, at one point
I thought my gun had jammed
and almost picked up a
stone to chuck at the bunker
Sir!
- Relax... relax
As per the CO's plan,
we must shift base today
The new base will be closer
to the eastern side
At Soopra village
Right, sir
Shoulder to shoulder,
stride for stride...
when we move forward,
the enemy quakes with fear
Shoulder to shoulder,
stride for stride...
when we move forward,
the enemy quakes with fear
We must keep moving now
with one single thought
in all our minds
We must keep moving now
with one single thought
in all our minds
Come what may! We will melt
stone with our intensity
Come what may! We will
overshadow mountains like clouds
Shoulder to shoulder,
stride for stride...
when we move forward,
the enemy quakes with fear
Lets enter the battlefield
ready to sacrifice our life
Never rest until we have
reached our destination
We have the courage to
laugh in the face of adversities
We have the strength to
twist the arm of death
We are a wall of steel
guarding our borders
We are alert and ready
for any enemy
Come what may! We will melt
stone with our intensity
Come what may! We will
overshadow mountains like clouds
Shoulder to shoulder,
stride for stride...
when we move forward,
the enemy quakes with fear
Keep the flame of fervor
alight in your heart
And you shall sing
the song of victory
Keep the flame of fervor
alight in your heart
And you shall sing
the song of victory
The portrait of victory
we're out to paint
will be coloured by our blood
We all know, in our hearts now...
It's either do or die!
Even if fire and lightning
befall our path
You will not be alone,
my brothers in arms
Whatever be the hardship
whatever be the strife...
Your comrades are with
you now and forever
Come what may! We will melt
stone with our intensity
Come what may! We will
overshadow mountains like clouds
Shoulder to shoulder,
stride for stride...
when we move forward,
the enemy quakes with fear
I often think about the one I love
Her memory torments my heart
