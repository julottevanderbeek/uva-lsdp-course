Sir, good afternoon
How's the situation over in
Phnom Penh?
A lot of personnel changes.
The situation can still be
considered stable.
Sir, you can't take my money
I know that is my fault
The money is very important
to me for saving a life.
Can you give it back to me?
Thank you.
What's up?
Cheung Chi-Mun
You're free to leave prison.
Mark
I was supposed to pick you
up at the airport....
lnstead you picked me up at
prison
Where's Dad?
Uncle's waiting for you at
the drug store.
Yesterday I almost lost my
life at the airport.
If I hadn't paid them off,
we'd be meeting inside the
prison.
When those customs officers
see money,
their eyes light up like car
headlights.
Mark, you went through a lot
of trouble for me.
Pedicab
It's a good thing they like
money.
Otherwise you'd still be
rotting in jail.
Bye-bye
''Bye-bye''
Is that ''goodbye'' in
Vietnamese?
They don't know what you're
saying
In Hong Kong, what do you
hear about the war?
We've got a piece of news
black-out,don't know a thing
The radio and newspapers
all report....
...the Viet Cong are very
close to the city.
The situation is terrible.
It's good you've come back.
Help me persuade Dad.
He's not convinced that the
situation is bad.
You said there's a news
black-out here.
How can anybody know what's
going on?
The city looks peaceful
enough.
Mun, didn't you apply for
Uncle's visa?
The line outside immigration
goes on forever.
You get nowhere without
bribes.
The Chinese have been here
for decades.
Asking them to shut down
their businesses...
...is worse than killing
them.
Why do you think I worked
in the black market?
Only to get him a passport.
And it all came to nothing.
Which one of us gets them?
They're yours
Hello
How are you?
War mongers, go home
Let's make a fast turn
The pedicab's broken down.
- Get off and push
Great
Chicken buttocks
Pat, get the soy sauce.
Uncle, here's some wine.
I put Chinese wine in a
foreign brandy bottle.
Almost got confiscated in
customs.
Drink up so it won't go to
waste. - Yeah
You're clever to put the
wine in a brandy bottle.
Mainland Chinese products
aren't allowed in.
You've to remove the label
or change the bottle.
Did you go to Mainland China
to see your Dad?
How can I go there now?
It's chaos there with the
Cultural Revolution.
Even if I went, I wouldn't
know how to find him.
We've been separated for
over ten years.
Uncle, I bought this at the
China Products Store.
This is good wine
Delicious
Pat
Not fish sauce. I hate fish
sauce.
I want soy sauce
The black stuff
Get going
Soy sauce.
Who's that kid?
At New Years when the Viet
Cong entered Hue,
he was separated from his
parents.
I took pity on him and took
him in.
When I asked him his name,
he just stammered.
I didn't understand what
he said.
So I call him Pat.
Dad
What was Dad gabbing about?
We need money to get Dad
out of here.
I was already arrested by
them once.
A second time would be very
dangerous.
But there's a war going on.
It's dangerous no matter
what you do.
Anyway, nothing ventured
nothing gained.
Who are you looking for?
My ex-boss went to Thailand.
When I was in prison, Chung
told me of new buyer.
Miss Chow Ying-Kit.
I'm familiar with Saigon.
May be I'll recognise this
Chow.
Which one of us gets her?
She's mine
She's responding
Not the reaction we hoped
for
Are you Cheung Chi-Mun?
Hello, Mr. Chow
Hello.
This is my cousin Mark.
Let's go over there.
Mr. Cheung, you've just
gotten out of prison.
You're fast at making
connections.
What's your connection with
Bong?
Chung introduced me.
Chung?
- Yes.
I can tell the soldiers
outside...
...to use you for target
practice
What's the matter?
They're looking for Chow
Ying-Kit.
These two guys are friends
of mine.
Let me talk to them.
It's Ok.
Leave
Does she know us?
This is your territory. Why
ask me?
You're looking for Chow Ying
Kit?
He's ''10th Uncle'', the boss
here.
I'm Chow Ying-Kit.
Bong is a complicated
fellow.
He doesn't need you for
the black market.
There's lots of other ways
to make money.
Why choose this path?
You've been in prison.
If Bong cheats you...
...and you're arrested again
You'll never see HK again.
I've done business with
Bong twice.
He could have betrayed me
long ago.
You say that Bong's
complicated.
In this business, aren't
we all?
Mr. Cheung.
You're an outsider.
We're all Chinese.
A piece of advice for you.
Don't get involved in things
you can't control.
Good-bye.
Miss Chow.
Miss Chow.
Please don't blame us for
our ignorance.
He's an overseas Chinese.
We're doing this for my
uncle.
You know now these old
Chinese are.
They struggle all their
lives to get ahead
lf I can't get them out of
here,
and they stay, what is it
all for?
So I've come back to take
them to Hong Kong.
I don't want to gamble like
this.
You've seen this country.
Everyone gambles.
Including this war.
Nobody knows what tomorrow
will bring
Our gambling chips...
...are being played by
others.
We have no control over who
wins or loses.
Not even a choice over
whether to play or not.
If this were our own place,
we wouldn't need to leave.
Everyone here tonight is
escaping.
To leave or to stay,
it's all a gamble.
You're very capable.
If you don't serve as the
casino's banker,
we won't even have a chance
to gamble.
You said that all of us are
Chinese.
Try to see it from our
perspective.
Tell us what to do.
According to my usual
practice,
I never conduct business
here.
As to the time and place,
I'll have someone contact
you.
What are you doing?
I'll have someone contact
you.
Don't bother. I'll answer it
It's just the phone Why so
anxious?
It's Mun's girlfriend.
Asking him to have a last
fling.
Then what are you so nervous
about?
Me?
Waiting for your girlfriend,
too?
Mun and I met that girl at
the same time.
So part of the fling should
be mine.
I'm going over now for my
phone fling.
His Dad and I used to be
just like that, too.
It's hard to escape the
tender trap
What are you laughing at?
You don't even know what
I'm talking about
Take your dinner
Let me have the phone
- Come on
Hello, Miss Chow.
Hello?
Hello? Hello?
Why isn't she saying
anything?
She already hung up.
- Playing tricks on me
What's up?
Tonight at 8:30 at the
Alhambra Theatre.
Miss Chow, it's getting late
still want to wait?
This car's from the Foreign
Ministry.
They wouldn't dare to do
anything rash.
Don't try anything
We have a permit from the
Foreign Ministry.
Bong, Bong. - You haven't
stopped the car yet
Mum Mum
Hello
We've been waiting for you
a long time.
This is Hung.
Please excuse us for being
late, Miss Chow.
Miss Chow Ying-kit is the
buyer I told you about
This is my cousin, Mark.
Miss Chow, this is Bong.
Pleased to meet you.
Let me help you with this.
Move out of the way Over
there
You, too. Hurry up
Have a smoke.
Let them conduct a thorough
search.
Have some gum and then
search him.
Come on
Hurry up
Go where?
Upstairs.
Make a thorough search.
Search upstairs.
Mark, stay here. Il'll stop
Bong from getting away.
Don't go there. It's too
dangerous.
The army is on its way up.
Sooner or later we'll have
to make our escape.
Cover me. I'll get the gold
back.
No bullets left
Take a jump, Mun
Forget about the money.
Let's get out of here.
What about Miss Chow?
How's Miss Chow?
Over there
Mark
Mark Mark
Mark, are you Ok?
Very proud of yourself,
aren't you?
Did you see Bong's
expression?
You certainly earned your
commission.
Otherwise, why go to so much
trouble?
I worship you more than any
other woman on earth
Miss Chow,
Let me return this to you.
I hope I didn't get your
lipstick dirty.
I forgot all about it
I'd never thought you'd take
such good care of it
Old songs always make for
great listening.
Proof that old things are
better than new ones.
Do you agree with me?
''10th Uncle''
What are you trying to say?
I think you still remember
Mr. Ho.
He made you what you are
today.
Could you ever forget him?
Ho disappeared in Holland
I miss him very much.
If it weren't for him,
l wouldn't have the success
l have today.
You don't have to remind me.
What is Ho's relationship
to you?
More than ten years ago,
when Ho was just starting
out,
he came into the bar one
night.
l was singing in the bar
at the time.
l thought...
just one man against ten...
l acted on impulse and
grabbed a knife.
l saved his life.
Afterwards,
l travelled the world with
him.
We were together a long time
He was not only my lover,
but also my confidante.
Now,
his enemies are out to kill
him,
so he's disappeared for 3
years.
Do you know what it feels
like...
...too lose someone dear?
The dearest person to me is
my father.
l don't know what's happened
to him.
Nobody knows if he's alive
or dead.
All these years, everything
l've done....
has been for my uncle and
my cousin Mun.
l don't dare have any hopes
for myself.
l only know....
the bigger the hopes,
the greater the
disappointment.
Actually, hopes are just
a big gamble.
lf you lose, it's very
painful.
l'd rather not even try.
Before, when l was poor...
l just wanted to make it
big.
Now,
l have money, position,
everything but a close
friend.
lt's hard to make it to the
top, but impossible to
go back.
There are many things, l can
look back & observe,
but l can't go back.
Since you don't expect too
much,
you should be happier than
me.
lt's been a long time since
l talked so much
Really?
- Yes
Later on, please don't cry
What's the use of going back
ln 1997 Hong Kong will be
handed over to China.
We'll just have to come back
here.
Vietnam has been at war for
many years.
The situation here is no
worse than before.
Uncle, it's 1974. 23 years
until 1997.
That's a long time.
Might as well go back for
a look.
Yeah
Let's go.
lt's all a matter of fate.
Everthing is pre-ordained.
Mark, the taxi's waiting.
We're carrying a lot of cash
Will customs give us trouble
Don't worry. Kit knows those
guys.
She'll arrange matters for
us at the airport.
The signboard has been here
for over 20 years.
l can't bear to leave it
behind.
Pat
Be careful
Pat
The camera
Turn off the lights
l almost forgot we weren't
coming back
Uncle, l'll pack it for you.
This money for you. Don't
waste it.
l'll come back when things
have settled down.
Take good care of your
your health.
Don't forget to close the
windows at night.
Wipe away the dust when you
have time.
lt's up to you to take care
of this big place.
On clear days, take the
medicine out to dry.
We're running out of time,
Dad. Hurry up.
The taxi meter is running.
Let the medicine get mouldy.
Why are you so reluctant to
leave this shop?
l'll get you a new one in
Hong Kong.
Does he even understand what
you're saying?
He understands more than you
l looked at the sign,
and he knew to take it down.
Why didn't you take it down?
So what if he took it down.
Now it's up to me to get it
to the airport.
Let's go The plane won't
wait for us.
Why are you so impatient?
Go by yourself.
l'll tell Pat to hang it
back up.
l'm not going.
l went to a lot of trouble
to get your exit permit
Don't make all of us miss
the plane
lf you still have
instruction on the medicine.
You can write a detailed
letter from Hong Kong.
You have no sentiment for
the past
Ok, l'm going.
We've reached already.
l'll go in and get a luggage
cart. - Be careful
This signboard has given me
lots of troubles.
Be careful with that
sigboard.
Mun
Mun
Mun
lt's a pleasure to see you.
Where's Mark?
He went over there to look
for you.
Kit, we've a lot of US
dollars on us.
Will we have any problems?
- l'll find a way.
l'm mun's Dad.
Uncle, l'm Chow Ying-kit.
Miss Chow.
- Nice to meet you.
l'll go look for Mark.
Mun, is she the ''last fling''
Dad, what do you mean by
''last fling''?
She's going with us.
Don't jinx us by saying
unlucky things.
Wait for me here.
Kit
What's the matter?
There are a lot of new
people in Customs.
Don't worry, it'll be Ok.
l'll take a look to see
whether l know such people.
Get in line first.
Don't push
Don't take too long. Time
to board the plane.
Officer, have a drink on me
Trying to bribe me?
Just what do you think you
are trying to do?
Get out of the way
He has heart trouble
Don't push him.

-Dad, where's your medicine?
Dad
Uncle
Mun, hurry up.

Kit
You're Ok?
Fine
Better get on the plane

What about you?
l have to stay behind as a
witness.
Uncle
Go with your mind at ease.
You won't have to be
subjected to this anymore.
We accussd the Customs
officer of corruption,
so l have to stay here and
be a witness in court.
We'll all meet again in
Hong Kong.
Take care
You, too.
Hurry up and get on the
plane
Due to the Watergate
incident, the U.S. Congress
has requested President
Nixon's resignation.
According to observers,
after Nixon resigns,
the situation in Vietnam
will be worsen.
But the South Vietnamese
government emphasizes
they have confidence in
current situation.
And will continue their
liberal economic policies.
Next Monday, the President
of Vietnam
will convene an emergency
meeting...
...to deal fairly and
impartially...
...with the serious problem
of corruption.
He pledges to the National
Council...
...that the government will
be cleaned up.
Get out of the way
Stand to the side
Reuters reports a fierce
aerial attack...
...on South Vietnam last
Sunday.
Casualty figures are still
unavailable.
Due to the current
instability in Vietnam,
many Vietnamese boat people
have arrived...
in Hong Kong during the past
few days.
The Hong Kong government
and the UN....
...are conducting
discussions over ways...
...to humanely solve the
refugee problems.
l told you they were
finished
lt's a good thing we left
when we did
So what? We still lost our
home
Cousin Mark, if there's
anything l've done wrongly,
please forgive me
Don't be silly l got mad
just now. Don't bother me.
You'll be getting hungry as
you don't take dinner.
Have a bowl of soup, please.
Thank you.
Vietnam is in chaos.
l wonder how Kit is?
l hope she's OK.
We still haven't had any
news about her.
Cousin Mark
There's a car outside with
a flat tire.
You want to repair it?
Let me take a look.
Hey, friend Which tire
is flat?
Mun
Mun
Mun Look who's here
Mun
Mun
What's the matter? Can't

Tell him to leave it here.
Look who's come

Kit

to Saigon to find you
Mark and l talk about you
all day and night.
l mussed your hair
Great The family has been
reunited.
Uncle
Dad
Mun goes to the airport
everyday to wait for you.
Mark, take her things inside
Uncle, she has her own home.
How can you ask her to
move in here?
lt'll happen sooner or later
Sorry. l've sweaty palms.
How do you know the night

Our company has shares in

Evergreen invests in
everything
Excuse me, boss woman
Six, seven, eight
Sit down
Don't be bashful. Sit down
Let me introduce you. This
is my cousin, Mun.
Mark, let's just sit and
chat.
No need for so many
hostesses.
Silly ln this kind of a
place,
how can you not have
hostesses keep you company?
Kit, you're the boss here.
Why so few hostesses to
serve us?
You're not a very good
friend
Mr. Cheung, Miss Chow.
Mama-san.
This is Baby.
Baby, take a seat.
Maggie
This is my cousin, Mun.
Hello
She is Tina
Tina, Hello
Flora
Hi, Flora

Let's go.
Boss, tell Mama-san that l'm
very happy tonight.
l want her, and her... to
join me for a late snack.
Thanks.
Drink Drink
Find out what Mr. Cheung
desires,
and put it on my company's
bill.
Thanks a lot.
You can treat me whenever
l come here.
Have a good time. l'm

Kit, l'll take you home.
Oh, so Mr. Cheung is a
friend of Miss Chow's.
Miss Chow.
Miss Chow?
- ln the car.
Where?

Kit
See what you've done Go and
talk to her
Kit
Kit
She threw up all over the
car. Go and talk to her.
Kit
You take her home.
Hey
What's the matter?
Why do you want to go off
by yourself?
Why can't we three go
together?
There are a lot of things
Don't you and Kit involve
me in your affairs.
l'm giving you the chance
to take her back home.
You said that whoever she
chooses,
there will be no grudges
between us.
What do you mean by that?
You're giving me a chance
to be with Kit, right?
Mun, l know how you feel
about Kit.
Don't worry, l'll never say
you're pretty.
Pursue her whole-heartedly.
Don't disappoint Uncle.
Two cousins after the same
girl....
but only one can be her
bridegroom.
Mark
Kit, l'm Mun.
l'm not Mark.
l know. Take me home.
Mr. Cheung. Your car is over
there. Your keys.
l'm not leaving yet.
The Yanks and Vietnamese are
having peace talks.
There won't be any more
problems.
Miss Chow wanted us to move
back to Hong Kong.
That was an unwise move.
Hong Kong is more peaceful.
So we're refugees now
Ho Cheung Ching
Kit, they said you were
drunk.
So l didn't want to wake
you up.
l love the way you
redecorated my place.
l almost didn't recognise
my old office.
Fortunately, you haven't
changed.
Just a bit thinner.
You surely have so many
problems you can't solve.
l've come back to help you.
Uncle Let me do that.
We're having our grand
opening. Happy?
Of course l'm happy.
l've had a lot of time to
think these 3 years.
All day l'd ask myself...
how could my enemies find
out where l was in Holland?
My betrayer must be a
trusted friend.
Grand opening Here's a
lucky packet
Thanks, uncle
''10 Uncle'', tell everybody,
how Cheng knew my every
movement.
Mr. Ho, outsiders see how
close we are,
and try to drive a wedge
between us.
lf l did such a despicable
thing.
Would l have the guts to
meet you face to face?
Don't you worry about your
kids....
...in the United States?
Tell everyone how there
could be...
...so many killers waiting
for me at that Dutch bank?
How did your Swiss bank
account...
...become US$2 million
richer?
Mr. Ho, l've let you down.
l was wrong.
l won't make it hard on
your family.
l'll let you do the
honorable thing.
Get out of my way
l'll shoot anyone who tries
something
Mr. Ho, let me get out of
this alive.
Don't force me, Mr. Ho.
You've the guts to betray
me, why not shoot me?
Afraid you can't shoot?
They're blank
Miss Chow is busy?
This lucky packet is for you
Mr. Ho, let me go. l didn't
want this to happen.
l was forced into it by
that gang l....
ln three years, l never
killed one of own.
That's because you never
lost anything.
l grew up in the Cambodian
war.
l lost far too many things.
So l don't let go of things
very easily.
Uncle
Uncle, are you alright?
Dad
Uncle
Uncle
l'm Ho Cheung-Ching.
May be you've heard my name.
Both of you are very capable
Opening a garage so soon
after leaving Vietnam
No matter where you go, you
will make good.
You two were good companions
to Miss Chow.
Every man has price.
l'll pay you compensation.
You've been here long enough
l want you to leave Hong
Kong.
You're lucky to leave alive.
Don't come back.
Don't think that just
because you left Vietnam,
and came here that things
would be peaceful.
There's no difference.
You're lucky the flower
basket didn't kill you.
But luck doesn't last
forever.
l've said what l wanted to
say. You may leave.
Go to hell.
Mark.
You have one bullet.
See who has the guts to fire
Not many willing to roll
the dice in this world.
lf you can't afford to
gamble, don't gamble.
lt may not be fair.
Mark, forget about me. Kill
the bastard.
Don't act rashly.
You think there's a choice?
No. lf there were a choice,
millions of Vietnamese
wouldn't be trying to escape
There wouldn't be so many
beggars on the street.
The world wouldn't have so
many people starving.
People don't have choices.
Don't worry about me.
Don't give up your gun.
Mun
Dad, l should have let you
stay in Vietnam.
We went through so much to
bring you here.
lf you'd stayed in Saifon,
you'd still be alive.
Dad
Kit's come to pay her last
respect to Dad.
l'm responsible for his
death.
Don't be silly. You didn't
send those flowers.
lf it weren't for me, Uncle
wouldn't have died.
You mustn't stay apart
because of me.
Kit, there isn't any more
time.
They're forcing us to leave
Hong Kong.
Will you agree to go away
with Mark?
l'll help Mark pack his
things.
Tomorrow l'll buy plane
tickets and see you off.
Mun, you've to go, too.
We all leave tomorrow.
Ok. l'll find Ling and
start packing.
l brought you a gift from
Vietnam.
But l never had the chance
to give it to you.
See if you like it.
Thanks
lt's beautiful.
Try it on and see.
No matter what happens
tomorrow,
we must be honest with each
other.
Sorry, l lied to you.
Actually, l'm not going
with you.
You don't have to revenge
on Ho.
You two can't deal with him.
l can't. lf l must perish
with him, so be it.
The problems are my
responsibility.
Let me settle it
Settle them? How can you
do that?
Ho is returning to Vietnam,
to repossess his property.
We have an old score to
settle.
Please take care of Mark.
What good is it if you die?
What do you plan to do?
l'll take the morning plane
with Ho.
l know that Mark won't be
able to forgive me....
...for going with Ho back
to Vietnam.
lf l never make it back
alive,
l hope that you'll explain
everything to him.
Tell Mark that l didn't
betray him.
l hope he'll understand and
not hate me.
lt doesn't look like Saigon
will last much longer.
So we must get our money out
while there's time.
The situation out there...
reminds me of 1945.
The Japanese Army was
retreating from lndochina.
My Dad was a Japanese
businessman here.
But he couldn't bear to
leave his property behind.
ln the end, he was executed
by guerillas.
l was 6 at the time.
ln order to survive, l
assumed a Chinese name--Ho.
After all these years,
l've almost forgotten.
My real name is Tanaka.
Mr. Ho, they are searching
the vehicle ahead of us.
Don't worry.
Phone me as soon as you and
Ling get to Taiwan.
Take care
Where are you going?
To the airport.
You brought the plane
tickets?
Yeah.
What about Kit? You're not
waiting for her?
We arranged to meet at the
airport.
She didn't say she was going
to the airport.
We arranged it. She'll be
there for sure.
Mark, don't lie. Kit isn't
even in Hong Kong.
Where is she?
She took the morning flight
to Vietnam.
He went with Ho.
So there's no need for you
to go looking for Ho.
Pat
Nobody here
lt's Pat
Pat
Don't shoot
You forgot us so quickly
Mun, look He's a soldier
What is he talking about?
How is father?
Have you received any of his
letter?
What is he talking about?
With the Yanks leaving,
there's an oil shortage.
The phones are out of order,
too.
We'll have to split up and
search for Kit.
Miss Chow, so we meet again
ln this world, those who
should die never die
Why should people like you
survive?
Thanks to you l was jailed
for ywo months.
But you won't be so lucky
this time.
Lock them up. Deal with
them the army way.
So you're Bong? l'm Ho.
Kit's boss.
l'd like to talk business
with you.
lf we can work together,
l'll give you US$3 million.
We'll both come out ahead.
Ok, but l won't let you
leave my side.
No problem.
But l have one condition:
l hear that all flights
might stop at any moment.
You army people have your
own methods.
lf you can get me some
documents,
and use military connections
to get us out,
l'll pay you immediately.
Mun, l found Miss Chow.
Does Mark know?
Mark hasn't come back yet.
But Miss Chow only wants
to see you.
Let's not wait for Mark.
l'll take you over to Miss
Chow's.
lf she leaves,
it'll be impossible to find
her again. We better hurry
Mark's here, too. He really
wants to see you.
Here are two plane tickets.
Saigon will fall soon. All
flights have stopped.
Only two seats left for me
last flight out tomorrow.
You and Mark must go.
We're Hong Kong citizens.
We're not in any danger.
There's a war going on here.
With a change in government,
anything can happen.
Kit, if it's so serious, you
should come with us.
l still have business to
attend to here.
Don't worry. Ho and Bong
have an agreement.
We'll get out with the
military's help.
No way l can't let you
leave us again.
The only reason we came
back was for you.
l want to take you back
to see Mark.
Mun, when you're in the
midst of a war,
you must put your emotions
to the side,
and just survive
l shouldn't have let you
come back.
You can't solve all of our
problems by yourself.
l'll tell Pat to bring Mark
here. Wait for him.
l don't have time to wait.
At times like this, who has
the right to make requests?
Nothing is ever really one's
own.
The more hopes you have,
the greater the pain.
l can't see him again.
- No
Kit Kit
Mun, are you alright?
Can you move?
- Yes.
Leave now.
Pat
This is wooden wall.
Mun, look
Mun
Who is it?
ls Mun dead?
Actually, you decided long
ago to return with Ho.
So why did you look us up
in Hong Kong?
You knew that l came back
to Saigon with Mun,
so why did you only want
to see him?
You have so many secrets.
What else haven't you told
me?
l have nothing to explain.
lf you say l'm wrong then
l'm wrong.
l've never regretted
anything.
You really know how to
handle a gun.
You've killed so many people
Even Mun died at your hand.
Why don't you shoot me, too?
How many will you kill
before you're happy?
There's no reason behind our
actions.
Who is right, who is wrong,
someday you'll understand.
When Mun came,
he told me over and over
that,
if you find someone whom you
truly love,
never give them up, even if
it means death.
He said that you'd never
betray me.
But now l know what kind
of a person you are.
Even if you aren't my enemy,
l never want to see you
again as long as l live.
Mark
Mark
Mark
Mun isn't dead He's over
there Hurry

Mun
Mun
Mark
Mun
Have you seen Kit?
Where's Kit? Why isn't she
with you?
Kit?
This is the cash left in
Vietnam.
lt's mine.
No matter where l go, it'll
always return to my side.
Things that don't belong to
you will never be yours.
Don't move.
Mr. Ho, we're both playing
for the same stakes.
l'm in charge here.
You can't fight me without
shattering yourself.
The U.S. Consulate is
burning its cash.
They're treating thier money
like garbage.
But to us, this green paper
money...
...is worth dying for and
killing for.
Miss Chow, don't move
Put your gun down
At times like this l realize
how much we need each other.
Why did you bring a time
bomb?
Mark is in Vietnam.
l know that neither of you
will let the other go.
What is so great about Mark,
that you'd pay such a price?
When you pay the final price
You haven't time to consider
its worth.
Ok
Mark, where are you?
Ho Cheung-Ching?
Ho Cheung-Ching?
l'm not Ho Cheung-Ching
My name is the same as God's
There is no meaning to my
name.
Listen, my real name is...
When you die, l want you to
know who killed you.
Even God will not care.
A man is responsible for his
own actions.
lt's becoming a slaughter-
house out there.
Everyone is after revenge.
Welcome to our vengeful
world.
This place is like hell.
You have no way to go.
l know The last plane out
of Vietnam has left.
lt makes no difference if l
live or die.
l just want to see blood
debts paid in blood.
You've a just a garage
mechanic
Remember,
what goes around, comes
around.
You'll get what you deserve
My gun is already out of
bullets.
You have your chance.
Don't shoot
Kit
After all these years with
you,
the only my regret is
injuring Miss Chow.
Mr. Ho, when you go to the
airport,
the most important thing
is to bring the money.
Kit
Why did you come back?
lf l didn't, l'd regret it
the rest of my life.
l've never regretted
anything.
Kit
You said l'll be repaid for
what l did, but where is it?
The price of our actions
will be paid by our
loved ones
No matter what, l'm going
to get even.
lf you shoot, l'll be
grateful.
Grateful for bringing Kit
and me together.
l'm going now.
Don't let Kit follow me.
