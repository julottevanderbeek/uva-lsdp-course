Inspired by real events.
In the winter of 1940
the Brits and Germans fought in Norway.
The goal was to gain control over
yhe iron ore supply in Norway.
There was fighting between German bombers
and British fighter planes.
- Is there any casualties? Strunk?
- No.
- Schwartz?
- I have been hit in the elbow.
Hauk?
- Hauk!
- Hauk is dead.
Sergeant, take some of Overkonstablens
wounds. Disinfect and suture it.
I go over and find out
which way to go.
Am I going to die?
I will surely not die?
They have been injured in the elbow,
Overkonstabel. In the elbow.
Ready?
Why did he fly so far?
They said we all had to turn back.
We should not let it hang down.
Mr. Lieutenant? Lieutenant!
Lieutenant!
- Schopis!
- I'm down here!
In the snow!
What happened?
I fell down there.
That was what happened.
Excellent.
- Joseph, your book.
- What have you got?
I waited for six hours
at Alexanderplatz.
Finally, Hitler came by.
It's his autograph.
Biscuits, chocolate, sausage,
sauerkraut and beer.
- Beer?
- You never know, Mr. Lieutenant.
Yes. You are right.
What do we do now?
We march to the coast,
find our army and go to war again.
Hauk fell for his country.
"In time of need
raises as heroes -
- Filled with contempt for death,
determination and a cool head. "
"But ..."
"But there must be an external
incident to call genius. "
"Fate auction,
forcing one man to their knees -
- Makes sudden another
for a determined completely. "
It is as if Hitler speaks to me.
Speaking to us.
Do you understand it?
We were alone against three enemy planes,
and we survived.
And we got shot one of them. It is
Minus 20 degrees, and we do not freeze.
Turn off the light.
We are use up the battery.
We can not just go
in a random direction.
Beware!
Strunk!
- The sled is too heavy!
- Loosen the belt.
- What?
- Loosen the belt!
Oatmeal.
Do we have water?
Strunk, turn up the oven.
Norwegians are thorough people.
shit.
There are only two.
Can you hear it?
- Stop!
Stop! Stand!
Englishmen.
- Mr. Lieutenant?
Thank you.
Lieutenant Horst Schopis.
Sergeant Wolfgang Strunk
and Constable Joseph Schwartz.
Lieutenant, we should not shoot them?
- No.
- Why not?
- We are not wild Hottentots.
- In English.
- Quiet.
They kill us if they get the chance.
I'm sure.
Well, then go ahead.
- Should I shoot them?
- Yes.
Yes. You have my permission.
Come on.
But they would also
be useful as hostages.
They can lay a false trail in the snow,
when we go from here.
- So I should let them live?
- Yes.
It is probably the best.
- Strunk.
Are you okay?
Yes.
It's nothing.
- What?
- Girls.
Our position is 62 degrees,
- So are we ...
- Four kilometers.
- Two kilometers ...
Strunk? Strunk?
It is two o'clock.
It's your turn to keep watch.
No!
No! No.
- Joseph ...
- No!
I dreamed Brits ate me.
They laughed as they ate me.
- They sleep.
- I do not trust them.
That we do not need.
We are armed.
We bombed British ships
and shot down British planes.
- Why can't we just shoot them?
- They are useful as hostages.
Lieutenant?
Where is your gun?
I have it in my hand.
Strunk, I can not.
Up.
Lieutenant!
Lieutenant!
Strunk!
Lieutenant!
Follow the trail.
Over here!
We have to go back.
Go back to the hut.
Lieutenant, why did we not?
I do not understand.
- All the other ...
- Enough, Overkonstabel.
Why did we not?
We had our orders.
I made a decision.
- But ...
- There is nothing more to say about it.
Yes, come on, Schwartz.
You should see your face.
I'll kill you.
- Move!
- Joseph! Give me your weapon.
- Move!
- I said, put the weapon.
- You're a dead man.
You are completely out of control.
Give me the weapon.
- Move!
- You're a dead man!
Do it.
We found Schnapps,
and we must all drink
Come on.
We must win.
Drink some more.
- Yes, we will win.
- Come, Smith, they will win.
Drink for Germany.
Did we win?
Yes. Just go back to sleep.
- Everything is in order.
- What are you doing?
Will you just ...?

MILITARY
CAMP AT STRYN
I came across a dead German aircraft.
Here at Heilstuguvatn.
Well, that's where they went.
And the crew?
I do not know.
We must look for them tomorrow.
What happened?
- Is it gone?
- They turned gangrene.
- You would otherwise be dead.
- I am terribly sorry.
Look at me!
You have sacrificed your arm to the master.
He would be proud of you.
Here. Eat some chocolate.
There is plenty.
Can we go home now?
Yes, we're going home now.
Beautiful.
Frisk him.
It's okay.
No!
Stand up!
The lieutenant would like to say something.
- It's just a lighter.
Horst Schopis spent seven years
as a prisoner of war in Canada.
A few days after his release
they returned to England, -
- Drew Davenport and Smith
were sent on the Mission of Trondheim.
Once again, they were shot down.
Davenport was captured and spent
the rest of the war in a German prison camp.
Smith died in the attack.
Strunk is buried in a
war cemetery in Trondheim.
Joseph spent the rest of the war
in a Canadian prison camp.
In 1977, Horst received a call
at his home in Munich.
It was Davenport.
He invited Horst to London.
Soon after, the two former enemies met
as friends.
