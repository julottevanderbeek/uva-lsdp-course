Peking - China.
The summer
of the year 1900.
The rains are late,
the crops have failed,
a hundred million
Chinese are hungry
and a violent wind
of discontent
disturbs the land.
Within the foreign compound
a thousand foreigners
live and work,
citizens of a dozen
far-off nations.
Priests and missionaries,
bankers and businessmen,
engineers and adventurers,
diplomats,
soldiers and students...
People with families, homes,
jobs.
Many have lived here
a lifetime and feel secure
as they go about
their daily routine.
What is
that terrible noise?
Different nations
saying the same thing,
We want China.
Sha-shao!
Separated from the compound
by only
a wall and a gate,
is the Forbidden City.
Here, in untouchable isolation
lives the Dowager Empress,
last of the Manchus.
Protected by
an army of eunuchs,
she holds court
and confers with her ministers,
mandarins and generals.
Halt the execution.
But Prince Tuan s orders!
Now
you have my orders.
The nightingale will recover.
The Court physician s
arts will work.
Only yesterday
I listened to its song.
The execution
has been stopped.
Who?
Jung-Lu,
Your Majesty,
I come to ask
your displeasure.
My life instead
of the Colonel s.
We cannot spare you.
I gave the order
to fire on the Boxers.
They were burning missions,
killing foreigners.
We have sad news.
The nightingale...
it was your gift.
Do you remember, Jung-Lu?
I have not forgotten.
I live to serve Your Majesty.
How does the attack
on the Boxers serve
Her Highness?
If they are unchecked,
foreign armies will fall
- on China.
- We are tens of millions.
Does the Empress believe that
where the imperial Army has failed,
the rabble will succeed?
- Our Gods are with the Boxers.
- The nightingale is still.
I hear only
the sound of crows.
Your Majesty,
a violent wind
is short-lived.
The Boxers have arisen
like the wind and rain,
and like the wind
and the rain, will die.
May the Boxers be guided
by the will of the gods.
About the Colonel, Your Majesty.
His end
will be a sign,
and a warning
to the foreigners.
His death
is of no consequence.
But his life has set
my Prince against my General
and this disturbs
the morning s tranquility.
Let him die
for this offense.
You are concerned, Jung-Lu?
If the Boxers fail,
I will give the foreigners
Prince Tuan s head.
Eyes front, soldier.
All right,
Marines, eyes front!
We re almost in Peking,
the capital city of China.
This is an ancient,
highly cultured civilization,
so don’t think
you re any better than them
because they
can t speak English.
A few Chinese words
go a long way.
Repeat after me.
The word for yes is shih.
Shih.
- The word for no is poo shih.
- Poo shih.
it s the same here
as anywhere else in the world,
everything has a price.
Pay your money and
don’t expect any free samples.
Yes, sir.
Right turn!
Column... Halt!
We going to stop that, Major?
Stay right there!
- Murphy!
- Yes, sir?
Ni hao.
Tell the Boxer chief
I want to do business with him.
I want to buy
the old man.
But he's not American.
Twenty dollars.
Hold it!
Tell him the old man
must be alive.
Nothing if he s dead.
Forty dollars.
All right.
He s dead.
But he say
you pay
for spoiling the ceremony.
Nothing doing.
Twenty dollars.
Tell him
I'll still do business.
I'll buy
the dead Boxer.
Forty dollars.
Twenty dollars.
- Did you fire that shot?
- Yes, sir.
Nice shooting, Sergeant.
Thank you, Major.
That'll cost you twenty bucks
out of your pay.
Fall in!
Alright...
Fall in!
- Take them to the barracks.
- Yes, sir.
- Murphy!
- Sir?
Madame.
Tell her I’m waiting.
I have sent her
a note, Excellency.
You re the owner.
Tell her.
Here s your key, Count.
Excellency, please.
As Russian Minister here
I order you to get her down.
As you wish, Excellency.
But remember she is still
a guest. I cannot order her.
Excellency, I think
you need a cold drink.
- And so do I.
- Champagne, sir?
How are you?
it's been a long time.
Natasha!
Baroness Ivanoff!
Yes, Sergei?
You keep me waiting
and then ignore me.
You are a little
nervous, Sergei.
I suggest something cool
for all of us.
Excuse me.
Natasha...
Thank you.
I won t talk
about the necklace.
But you are.
- As Russian Minister in Peking...
- Please, Sergei,
speak as
my brother-in-law.
Natasha,
I've told Bergmann
your visa s canceled.
So you cannot stay
in this hotel.
Or in Peking
or even in China.
- By law you don’t exist.
- That s frightening.
Where will you go?
To your Chinese friends?
How you hate me, don’t you?
No, you re wrong.
I don’t hate you.
Go!
You fool.
Is it my fault,
if you lose everything
and end up naked
in the street...?
Not completely naked.
There s still the necklace.
Today...
- She has to go today.
- Yes, sir.
I'll see to it.
Good evening.
I want a room
with a bath this time.
- Have you reserved, sir?
- You're late, Lewis.
Hello.
Hello.
When did you arrive?
- Today.
- Why so late?
We walked
the last 10 miles.
Don’t the trains work now?
Gentlemen, the railroad
is no more.
- Major Lewis!
- Bergmann.
- Is there a room for me?
- They re all taken.
But if you'll wait
- a short while...
- Fine.
Thanks, Chiang.
Here you are.
Any time you need me.
Half my life s here.
Take care of it.
And more of your life’s here.
Oh, yes.
Let me use the bin.
Wont you open it?
Open it and
you must read it.
Then you must answer.
Lewis!
- Ah, Carlo!
- My dear chap!
- Captain.
- You re late.
What kept you?
I lost 2 men.
Had to bury them.
- Come on, let's get a drink.
- Alright.
Try and get a room
here too, Andy.
I want to look up the kid.
Ah yes, your little girl.
- How old is she now?
-11.
No, she must be 12.
It s a pity. No mother
and practically no father.
What can I do?
She s in a French mission
for Chinese orphans.
You re better than most.
You do try to see her.
But leaving her in a mission
is no way to raise her.
But what do I do?
Take her to Illinois?
How would she make out there?
They'd treat her
like a freak.
She s better off
among her own kind.
- You really think so?
- Sure.
May I have your key?
I need it for
the American officer.
Thank you.
Besides,
you have to live
your own life.
I've just had an invitation.
Please sit down, Major.
Ask him and
we'll drink together.
He d tell us his troubles.
What shall I tell you?
That you're happy I’m here.
You re very direct.
I’m a marine.
I’m short on time.
How much is there for me?
All you want.
Have you found
this approach successful?
Not really, no.
I don’t know another.
Keep drinking, Major.
The uniform
will hold you.
- Clever women make me nervous.
- No, please...
Please don’t go.
What can I offer you?
My life?
My room.
They gave it to you.
Is that too much to ask?
My life isn't worth much,
but hotel rooms here
are at a premium.
Do you always offer
your life to strangers?
To a soldier, strangers
are the best friends.
I’m not in uniform, Major.
Things are fine
as they are.
Major Lewis.
A British orderly
to see you.
The Minister wishes
to see you, sir.
He told me to tell you
he s been authorized
to act for your Minister.
Fine. Tell him
I'll be right along.
Yes, sir.
Here s you key.
Thanks.
What about your things?
- Put them back.
- But there s only one room.
Let the Baroness
figure it out. She s clever.
Don’t laugh yet, Major.
It s a very small room.
I've been
in tight places before.
So have I, Major.
- Daddy!
- Teresa!
Daddy!
Daddy!
- Hello, Britten.
- Good day, sir.
Wake up, sentries!
Take a tip
from an old soldier.
Whenever you see a Major
of the American Marines,
you will present arms.
And don't forget it!
If this be I,
as I suppose it be,
my little dog
will know me.
Come in.
I’m, sorry,
are you busy?
Of course I am.
I always am.
Busier than usual?
Or just busy?
Both.
Well, what s
the pressing female problem?
Just this,
Am I to pack or not to pack?
Do we go to England?
Do we leave
this year or not?
I don’t know.
You don’t know...
Pack. If we don’t go,
all you need do is unpack.
If men had
to do the packing,
the world
would be different.
- If I had my way...
- What?
We d have packed long since
and now be miles away.
We?
A comforting thought.
Thank you, darling.
Will it all
go up in flames?
- Not if I can help it.
- What?
I'll put it
in a nutshell.
If I encourage the Great Powers
to be tough with China,
China will become just
another battlefield for them
to fight over.
It s wiser to accept
temporary humiliation
at the hands
of the Boxers
in the hope that
by damping down the fire,
the kettle
won t boil over.
And then?
I shall probably receive
the Government s displeasure,
and we'll be retired
on an inadequate pension.
Remember what Napoleon said?
I never forget it.
Let China sleep.
' When she wakes,
the world will tremble.
He said a lot, didn't he?
Come in.
- Major Lewis, sir.
- Ask him to wait.
Darling, I have to put on
my official face.
You haven’t forgotten
our soirée?
Twenty-four bottles of champagne
are already on ice.
- Anything else the Sahib requires?
- The first waltz.
I'll consider it.
Philip!
Major Lewis, Sir Arthur.
Stand up, sit down,
or walk around the room.
I'll walk around.
You please yourself.
I have an unpleasant
task to fulfill.
First, congratulations on
your initiative this morning.
We were a little late.
Unfortunate that
a Chinese was killed.
- A Boxer?
- A Chinese citizen, Major.
You re not
in the Wild West now.
You can t shoot
Chinese like red Indians.
No, sir.
Secondly,
I warn you that such
irresponsible behaviour,
could easily
involve us all
in a great conflagration.
I understand.
And lastly, since
your Minister is suffering
from a diplomatic illness,
you are required
here no longer.
No longer
required by whom?
This is a message
from your own Legation.
I d be delighted
if you stayed.
Yes, sir.
You know all hell s
going to break loose?
If it does, it will not be
because we have provoked it.
So we'll all
just walk soft and
hope for the best.
If we walked on our knees,
we can t stop it.
I've just marched
from Tientsin.
Boxers are everywhere.
Killing white men,
missionaries,
and all Chinese Christians.
The Imperial Army s
doing nothing about it.
Boxers have been
around for years.
You re unnecessarily alarmed.
Well, the next time
I see them killing an English
priest, I'll try not to be.
I've been a soldier myself.
I understand how you feel.
But my job s to see
the larger picture.
I wouldn't know about that.
I just patrol the rice paddies
in the back country.
I know this much...
If the Boxers come,
we'll need more soldiers
in these compounds.
Well, now we’ve both
had our say.
I'll go quietly.
Oh, by the way,
it s our Queen s birthday.
Tonight we re entertaining.
Why not come?
Thank you.
I won t leave Ming.
I'll pack him in my case.
Don’t be silly.
He d suffocate.
- What s that?
- He d suffocate.
- It s only for five weeks.
- Come on.
May we speak
to you, father?
It s very important.
There are no negotiations
at the moment. What is it?
Mother says we can't
take Ming to England.
- I wont leave my dog.
- He s my dog.
- Who feeds him?
- Who taught him to sit up?
Tell you what.
We'll cut him exactly in two.
You each get a half.
- Father. Don’t play King Solomon.
- Well, I tried.
Atten...
shun!
Shoulder...
arms!
Present...
arms!
Slope...
arms!
His Excellency,
the Minister of Austria-Hungary
and the Baroness Von Riedel.
Welcome, Prince Tuan,
to Her Majesty s Legation.
I am deeply honoured.
His Imperial Highness,
Prince Tuan.
I bring greetings
from our Empress.
You are
most welcome, Highness.
Greeting and felicitations
to your great queen.
May the lions
of China and Britain
live in peace forever.
Our Queen is touched
by the words
of your illustrious Empress.
Your Imperial Highness,
Your Excellencies,
ladies and gentlemen,
the first dance
will be the Military Two-Step.
Marvellous, fabulous.
They should be
around my neck.
Of course, Sophie,
you look naked without them.
- Shall we join the line.
- No.
Not yet.
I've waited
for this a long time,
and I’m enjoying it.
Natasha, you blind us
with your glitter.
Would you recognize me
without them?
I understand
you're going to Tientsin.
That's right, Excellency.
There’s a Russian woman
who wishes to leave Peking.
Anyone we know, Sergei?
She d do well
to meet you.
It may be her only chance
to reach Tientsin.
It might be...
If you disregard me the
Russian government will remember.
- Sir Arthur.
- Evening, Major.
Lady Robertson.
I wanted
to thank you personally
for trying
to help Father Bemish.
You know the Baroness?
Yes, of course.
It s been a long time.
I know my husband
has thanked you.
Yes, I've expressed
my gratitude.
This is Baroness Ivanoff.
- And Major Lewis.
- Your Highness.
You must be the American
who had the encounter
with the Boxers this morning.
It was the priest
who had the hard time.
My government
is most distressed.
But do not conclude
that all Boxers are bandits.
Most of them
are harmless vagabonds.
Market place entertainers,
much like the gypsies
in your country.
In fact, Sir Arthur,
I have brought such a troupe
to entertain your guests
tonight.
Boxers here?
With your permission.
Of course, Your Highness.
He wants you
to take this sword
and try to strike him.
Try it.
It s part of the performance.
If I kill a Boxer,
does that, er...
create a diplomatic incident?
There is no danger.
You've made your point.
Not quite.
Bravo!
I guess he wasn't
a true believer.
It seems, Sir Arthur, that
your troops are invulnerable.
Forgive me,
but the Major
doesn’t seem
to play the game
according to Chinese rules.
I apologize, Sir Arthur.
I don’t think he came here
tonight to play games.
Good night.
Unfortunately, Sir Arthur,
I must return
to my duties at the palace.
No need to escort me.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next dance will be a waltz.
- Aword, Sir Arthur.
- This is an insult to the British
and a challenge
to all Powers!
Areport
will reach the Kaiser.
Her Majesty's Government
is not alarmed by this
Boxer invasion of its Embassy.
I shall complain
to the Chinese ministry.
What will you do, Sir Arthur?
I intend to have
a glass of champagne.
You know,
I admire Sir Arthur.
He makes me think
that God must be an Englishman.
We go and we go
and we don't get anywhere.
Why not head back to the hotel?
- Are you tired, Major?
- Tired? No.
Ready to turn in? Maybe.
Ever been
inside this temple?
Wed get a better drink
at the hotel.
Very interesting.
Can we go now?
But we haven’t
had our dance yet.
Shall we?
What'll you do
in Tientsin?
I'll be entirely
in your hands.
You are now but you keep
slipping through my fingers.
I think I’ll get you to take me
to San Francisco with you.
Why to San Francisco?
It s where
they found all the gold.
Just a minute.
What s that trinket worth?
A lot of money.
We won t leave today. They've
killed the German Minister.
But Matt, we must leave...
I have to leave.
You have to wait.
Your sword, Sir Arthur.
You are well, Sir Arthur?
If you are, Your Majesty.
- We are pleased to receive you.
- It s an honour,
Your Majesty.
We have been informed
of the German Minister s death.
The Boxers
will be punished.
But the people s anger
cannot be quieted so easily.
The Germans
have seized Kiaochow,
the Russians Port Arthur.
The French have obtained
concessions in Yunnan,
Kwangsi and Kwangtung.
In all, thirteen of the
eighteen provinces of China
are under
foreign control.
Warships occupy our harbors,
foreign armies
fill our forts,
foreign merchants
administer our banks,
foreign gods disturb
the spirits of our ancestors.
Is it surprising
our people are aroused?
Please allow me to observe
that Boxer violence cannot
redress China s grievances.
China is a prostrate cow!
The Powers are
butchering her for her meat.
If China is a cow, she is
indeed a marvellous animal
that gives
both meat and milk,
but at the same time
grows stronger.
She learns
Western arts of peace.
But China s greatest virtue
is her patience.
If she exercises that now,
she will achieve everything.
And if not?
If not,
if violence
and impatience prevail,
the blood of millions
will be shed
and the agony be prolonged.
Go to the window, Sir Arthur.
I’ve arranged something
for you to see.
Please inform
your government
that Chinese justice
is swift and thorough.
Those men murdered the
German Minister this morning.
Where lies the guilt?
With he who wields the sword
or who gives the command?
You know
who gave the command?
With your permission,
I d like to present
an eyewitness.
By all means,
Sir Arthur.
Major Lewis, Your Majesty.
Evidently, Major, you possess
secret information
about the Boxer leadership.
It s not much
of a secret.
Please go on, Major Lewis.
I saw the Boxer
commander this morning.
The one who had
the Minister killed.
You would know him?
It was Prince Tuan.
You believe this story?
I do, Your Majesty.
And you ask us to take
action against Prince Tuan?
I’ve come here
with the truth
now known by the German
government and the other Powers.
We reject your truth.
And your protest.
We are pleased
to inform you that Prince Tuan
is our closest adviser.
He now heads
the Foreign Office.
For our part, Great Britain
wants nothing more
than continued
friendship with China.
Because of the drought,
the hunger and the unrest
among my people,
of the merciless demands
of the foreign powers,
the situation in Peking cannot
be expected to become tranquil.
Therefore we
earnestly advise you
that all foreign residents,
including diplomatic personnel,
should leave Peking
within twenty-four hours.
Is Your Majesty informing me
that she is severing
all diplomatic relations?
Not at all.
Her Majesty
was clear enough.
She is offering informal
advice for your safety
and protection.
- I am in favour of that.
- Major.
She can't control the Boxers.
We d better get out.
Prince Tuan,
you will see
that these gentlemen
are escorted safely
to their Legations.
We d do better
on our own.
- Do we walk?
- Yes, very slowly.
Keep walking.
Squad!
Double time.
- Thought you d need some help.
- Thank you.
Count the votes.
We're awaiting
the American Minister.
Oh, Mr. Maxwell.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Sorry to have
got you up,
but we need your vote,
on staying in Peking or not.
The United States have no
territorial concessions in China.
Nor are we interested.
I d better abstain, Sir Arthur.
I understand, Mr. Maxwell.
I just wanted you to be here.
Congratulations, gentlemen.
It's unanimous.
Nine votes
in favour of evacuation.
Great Britain
has decided to stay.
Alone if necessary.
That s not possible.
We d look ridiculous
if we left
the British alone in Peking.
Perhaps Britain
has its reasons
for being the only
foreign power in Peking.
Our friend is right.
They may have
secret reports.
I’ve made it
completely clear.
Admiral Sydney
is on his way
with several thousand men.
He’ll be here
in 9 or 10 days.
Meanwhile, I refuse
to worry about
the Boxers giving
a victory to Prince Tuan.
Then the Germans stay too.
Sir Arthur,
we Spaniards
fulfill our obligations.
There s no word for
flight in our dictionary.
We feel obliged to protect
the civilians who depend on us.
I recognize
that obligation, Guzmán,
and I believe
that if we stand united
the Chinese
won't dare to attack
the representatives
of 11 great Powers.
If we stand firm,
there'll be peace in China
and in the whole world.
Spain is with you.
If the other Powers stay,
so will Austria.
Congratulations, Sir Arthur.
The British win
another bloodless victory.
I take it You’ve
unanimously decided to stay?
I shall report that
the first vote was9 to 1
and that in a friendly spirit
it was then decided
to make
the decision unanimous.
Well, then I suggest
we call in the military.
This way, gentlemen.
Colonel Shiba
will give the report.
As to the military aspects,
we have agreed that
with fewer than 400 men,
to defend
a 2-mile perimeter,
the position is untenable.
We recommend
immediate evacuation.
For political reasons the
Ministers say we must remain.
So you must defend
the area until Admiral Sydney s
forces arrive.
Sir, what if the relief
column doesn’t make it?
It s over 70 miles
through hostile territory.
We’ll consider
that situation when it arises.
We have 5 defense sectors.
The wall defended
by the Germans and Americans,
the west end,
the British Legation,
the Fu, held by
the Americans and Japanese,
and the east end, held
by the Italians and French.
- Boxers?
- Yes.
- Where the hell are they?
- All around us.
Their purpose is
to make us nervous.
Once the shooting starts You’ll
see them outside that wall.
Who's nervous?
No!
You cant have them!
But Sarah, we agreed.
We need the books
for barricades.
Not the Set of
the Napoleonic Wars.
Mother sent them
for your birthday.
I must confess
that French history bores me.
English history? Bah!
- Go away. The shop is closed.
- It s Baroness Ivanoff.
I thought all Peking's
doors were closed to me,
that I d lost face
in the Chinese streets.
Our Empress has
those same fears, Baroness.
The Boxers.
It is hoped
her wisdom will prevail.
I got your message, old one.
Your friend thinks
you should leave Peking.
- Which friend, old one?
- General Jung-Lu.
It was not possible before.
We would have been accused
of meddling in
Russian affairs.
And now?
Now...
it makes no difference.
The Boxers will attack.
If you disappear
in the confusion who d be left
to point a finger?
At 5 p. m. the fighting
will have begun.
You’ll meet a man at the corner
of the French Legation.
He’ll be wearing
a green peasant jacket.
You will be there?
- Go up on the ramp and take a look.
- Yes, sir.
- I don’t like this.
- Don’t worry.
Tell those men
to get their backs into it.
Whoa there.
- Where are you going?
- I’m getting out of Peking.
Those Boxers
out there are angry.
- Not with me.
- We have 200 rounds each.
- That s 20 per man per day.
- Enough for warming up.
They d better start out warm.
Yes, sir.
I’ll tell them.
Get out
before I get mad!
Mad Americans inside, mad Boxers
outside, mad Russians there...
I’ll risk going out.
I split the men in 2
platoons. 4 hours on, 4 hours off.
The sergeant will take
the first watch.
Right.
I wanted to go to Tientsin
but you prefer to stay.
I wear a uniform.
They pay me for that.
Go on then.
And get out of my way.
Have a nice war, soldier,
a real nice war.
Where do these go?
Where do you think?
Get up on that wall!
