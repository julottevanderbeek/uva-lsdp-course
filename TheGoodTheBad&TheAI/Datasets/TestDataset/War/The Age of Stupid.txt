­±¹ï®ð­ÔÅÜ¾E³Ì¤jªº§xÃø¬O¡A
One of the greatest difficulties with climate change
§Ú­Ì¤µ¤Ñªº±Æ©ñ¥i¯à·|¦b30¨ì40¦~«á¤~·|¹ï·Å«×¦³¼vÅT¡A
is that the effects of our emissions today are not actually realized in terms of the temperature
©Ò¥H¬O­Ó"®É¶¡©µ¿ð"ªº¨t²Î¡C
for 30 or 40 years so there is this time-lag system.
³o¹ï¤HÃþ´N«Ü´Æ¤â¡A
Which makes it difficult for us, humans, to respond
¬°§Ú­Ì¸g¹Lºt¤Æªºµ²ªG¡A´N¬O¥u·|¥ß§Yªº«Â¯Ù¦³¤ÏÀ³¡A
because we're evolutionary equipped to deal with the very immediate threats

like advancing armies or dangerous animals.
¹ï©óªø´Áªº°ÝÃD¡A§Ú­Ì´N¤£ª¾¦p¦ó¥¿½TªºÀ³¹ï¡A´N¹³®ð­ÔÅÜ¾E³oºØ¡C
We're not so well-equipped with dealing rationally with very long term problems like climate change.
©Ò¥H§Ú­Ì²{¦b´N¥²¶·¦³©Ò§@¬°¥H¨¾½d¥¼µM¡A
So we have to act now to stop something happening in the future,
¦pªG§Ú­Ì¯uªº­nµ¥¨ì®ð·Å¤w¸g§¹¥þ§ïÅÜ¦A°µ¨Æ¡A
if we wait until the full temperature effects are already upon us,
¤@¤Á´N¤Ó±ß¤F¡C
then it's far too late to stop.
°O¦í¤@­Ó¤ñ¬Æ»ò³£­«­nªº¼Æ¦r¡A
If you remember one single number above all else,

²{¦b´X¥G¥þ¥@¬É¡A
now everyone in the world pretty much,

the European Union, big multi-national corporations, Greenpeace, political parties,
³£¦P·N§Ú­Ì¥²¶·¨¾¤î¥þ²y®ð·Å¬Û¸û©ó¤u·~­²©R«e¤W¤É¶W¹L2«×¡A

¬O¡A¶W¹L³o­ÓÁ{¬ÉÂI¡A´N³o­Ó³o»ò¯U¯¶ªº¬É½u¡A
and the reason for that is because, if you cross that threshold, the narrow tipping point in the earth system,
·x¤Æªº¹Lµ{´N·|§¹¥þªº¥¢±±¡C
which could drive the warming process essentially out of control.
¥@¬É¤W¤j¶qªººÒ³£·|ÄÀ¥X¡A

³o¨Ç¦h¥X¨Ó¶i¤J¤j®ð¼hªº·Å«Ç®ðÅé¡A

·|¾É­P³ÌÁV¿|ªºª¬ªpµo¥Í¡A¦a²y¤Wªº·Å«×¤W¤É6«×©Î§ó¦h¡A
which then leads us up to the worst case scenario to 6 or more degrees
³Ì²×¤j³¡¤Àªº¥Í©R±N·|·Àµ´¡C
and the eventual wipeout of most of the life on earth.
¯à·½±Æ©ñ±q®t¤£¦h1950¶}©l¤£Â_¤W¤É¡C
So power emission has been going up, between, let's says, 1950,
²{¦b§Ú­Ì¥²¶·­nÅý¤W¤É´î½w¡AÃ­©w¡A
and now they need to level out, stabilize, and then decline
µM«áºÉ§Ö¤U­°¨ì¤@­Ó¥i¥Hºû«ù«í©wªº¤ô¥­¡A®t¤£¦h¦b2050¦~«d´î80%¡C
just as rapidly to sustainable levels about an 80% cut by 2050.
­«­nªº¬O¡A·Q­n¨Ï·Å«×¤W¤É´T«×¦b2«×¤§¤º¡A
But crucially, to keep the temperature rise within 2 degrees,
¦b2015¦~³o­Ó­È´N¥²¶·¹F¨ìÃ­©w¡C
this point of stabilization need to be at around 2015.
·N«ä´N¬O¡A¯uªº¡A§Ú­Ì¾Ö¦³ªº®É¶¡¤@¤À¤@¬íªº¹L¥h¡A
