x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",STORM,L664561,Beast.,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",BEAST,L664561,"Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--",3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",STORM,L664561,We all do.,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",BEAST,L664561,I wish I could go.,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",STORM,L664554,... until he found tungsten.,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",BEAST,L664554,Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",BEAST,L664508,"The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.",3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",STORM,L664508,What does that mean?,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664556,So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",BEAST,L664556,Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664556,For what purpose?,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",BEAST,L664556,"Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.",3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664552,Its core?,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",BEAST,L664552,It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",BEAST,L664510,"I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.",3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664510,Can the Professor repair his own mind?,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",JEAN,L664609,I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664609,Jean... can you?,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664593,"Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance.  Jean and I will go in here.",3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",JEAN,L664593,It's too far.,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664593,"I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?",3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664573,Uh-huh.,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",JEAN,L664573,Into the Hudson?,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664573,"Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.",3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664566,"He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.",3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",JEAN,L664566,What's that?,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664566,I'll tell you one thing though.,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",JEAN,L664566,"Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.",3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664566,Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664514,No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",JEAN,L664514,Are you all right?,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664512,We have to find Magneto.,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",JEAN,L664512,"He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.",3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",JEAN,L664502,His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664502,What's wrong with him?,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",JEAN,L664392,If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664392,"You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.",3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",JEAN,L664392,What are you talking about?,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664392,I don't like him being here.,3,1

x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",LOGAN,L664425,I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",LOGAN,L664422,I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664422,How long have you been in Alaska?,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",CYCLOPS,L664418,I wanted to talk to you.,3,1

x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",JEAN,L664475,What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",LOGAN,L664475,He takes himself seriously.,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",JEAN,L664475,He takes his work seriously.,3,1

x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",JEAN,L664469,Were you now?,3,1
x-men,"['action', 'sci-fi']",LOGAN,L664469,I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.,3,1
