Are you my guides?
I'm eli stone.
Eli stone.
I arranged a trek through
the ranikhet travel agency.
I'm going to the base
of the panch chuli peaks.
That's a laptop, so you--
You know, you might wanna...
i'll--I'll carry
this one myself.
Thank you. I got it. Thanks.
* and you've gotta
find a way to be okay *
I've got a lot to say, but
i'm a little underdressed
For the altitude, so
i promise to be brief.
I'm fine
I'm all right.
I'm just gonna-- I'm
gonna walk for a while.
I've been sitting for
the last 30 hours, so...
You probably haven't
heard of us.
Wow. Guys? Guys,
could-- Guys? Guys?
Guys, could you-- Could
you take my picture?
Here, uh, this--This--
That light's gonna come on
When it's ready to flash.
Like i've never used
a disposable before?
What do you
think-- Sunglasses?
* you need to worry
No, no sunglasses.
It's gonna be a long week.
Let's see-- Lawyer,
san francisco...
oh, did i mention i recently
found out i could be a prophet?
yeah, i was shocked, too.
Myelief in a higher power
was limited to worshipping
Okay, so maybe i wasn't
exactly saintlike.
I wasn't the idealistic
kid i used to be.
I was too busy
being that guy--
Insert caption. Opening paragraph.
Defendant beutel pharmaceutical,
comma, inc., i-N-C period,
Comma, space.
Opening paren, hereinafter,
Pursuant to rules 26 and
Patti!
There's an intercom, brando.
I swear, it's like
we work in a cleaners.
Do you hear that music? It's been
playing all morning. What music?
There was music playing.
I was wondering maybe you
could do something about it.
You want me to do something
about music i can't hear?
Forget it. Is my 2:30 here?
They're in the conference room.
Also, the fiance?Called.
Taylor called? Why didn't you tell me?
You told me not to bother you.
Since when does taylor bother me?
Well, all right, i was thinking of me.
Okay, from now on, there's a moratorium
On discussion concerning my future wife.
that includes e-Mails
and nasty facial expressions
And not telling me
when she's on the phone.
You take all the fun out of this job.
$60,000?
$60,000?!
Saying the number twice
doesn't double it, you know.
Y-You're gonna have
to add another zero.
really? Okay. Let's see...
$60,000 plus zero equals...
Wa... $60,000!
What about $80,000?
What?
I'm--I'm...
what is that, like
an organ or something?
M-My cell phone plays "ode to joy,"
But it's on vibrate.
What, three law degrees,
And all you guys can talk about
is organ music and ringtones?
Look, the only reason i came here today
Was because i thought
beutel was interested
In finally doing the right
thing. Ms. Keller, ???
By the vaccine court,
and they determined
Our client's vaccine didn't cause your
son's autism. Wow, except for "client,"
Just about every word in
that sentence was wrong.
First, it wasn't your client's vaccine.
It was a preservative
in it. It wasn't a urt.
It was a procedural hoop
i had to jump through
In order to get here.
And they didn't say
Your client's vaccine
didn't cause my son's autism.
They only said i couldn't
prove it. You still can't.
No credible scientist
and no reputable study
Has been able to prove
a causal connection
Between mercuritol and autism.
Then why is beutel
The only vaccine manufacturer
who still uses it?
You really wanna find out?
Lobby beutel's board
to make you the c.E.O.
You've got about as
much chance odoing that
As you do of winning this at trial.
And even if the jury doesn't believe me,
Maybe everybody reading
about the trial will,
And maybe they'll make sure
Not to use your client's product
to vaccinate their kids. Ms. Keller,
You know the first thing
i learned about litigation?
Client's won't know if you pad the bill?
okay, the second thing.
????
What you can prove in a court of law.
Now we can offer you $90,000.
I sincerely recommend you take it
And get on with your life.
$90,000's good.
Hey, the music. D-Do
you hear the music?
yes! Yes, i hear the music!
No, seriously, there's music playing.
George michael! That's who it is!
George michael? What the
hell are you talking about?
His song... uh, "faith."
Okay, not to be a prude, eli,
But i've got a deposition
at 8:00 tomorrow morning,
So could we forgo the role-Playing this
one time? I'm not--I'm not role-Playing.
????
It's been following me around all
day. A song has been following you?
Seriously, you don't hear it?
* oh, but i need some time off *
* from that emotion if i say
yes, will you come back to bed?
It's coming from the living
room. I'm glad something's coming!

if you
build it, he will come.
That's not funny, nathan.
Mm, yeah, i was afraid of that.
???
You have conjoined
butts in your cranium,
Which actually, it makes
you a double-Butthead.
look, aside from
the mild concussion you got
When your head hit the planter,
You are in medical terms
what we would call "fine."
I-I can't be fine.
George michael was in my living
room. There is nothing ????
It's just stress. Stress
gives you premature grays.
It doesn't make legendary
british pop stars
Sing their greatest hits live from your
couch. This is typical bonehead eli.
The seco you get your life together,
You think of some way to
ruin it. Call mom, would you?
What am i supposed to do if george
michael comes back? Get an autograph.
Eli?
Eli?
Eli!
And you say i yell. That's the
number for my acupuncturist--
Dr. Chen in chinatown.
He's a miracle worker.
My friend
viv--
He cured her tennis elbow
and constipation in one visit.
Well, good for viv. But i don't
believe in that stuff, so...
for a guy with auditory hallucinations,
You sure are judgmental.
Your 2:00 is here.
I don't have a 2:00.
???
Don't say anything. Patti!
Don't speak. It'd be an
ex parte conversation.
You're represented by
counsel. Not anymore.
Then have your new attorney contact me.
???
In the meantime, have a nice day.
Patti can validate your
parking. I realized yesterday
???
Is if i have an attorney who
plays at matt dowd's level,
And i think i found him.
He graduated valedictorian
at stanford law,
He clerked for ginsburg,
And he's an eighth-Year associate
at a blue chip firm. That's me.
You're talking about me. Why--Why you
talking about me? Because i want you
that's impossible.
I-I can't sue my own client.
There's an entire canon
of ethics prohibiting it,
And i'm pretty sure
that they call it a canon
'Cause it could kill me.
An article in the 2003
"harvard law review."
You see, this is why
the internet is evil.
Your firm sets up something
called a chinese wall.
I might be able to squeeze an
extra 10 grand out of beutel.
Now that's $100,000.
That vaccine made my son sick,
and it's still on the market.
But...
i...
i'm sorry.
yeah.
oh, well.
I had to try... right?
Bye, eli.
I got it
Your place is not that easy to locate.
I meani'm no marketer,
But a little signage
would do you wonders.
people who need find dr. Chen.
Now "relah." "Cloh" eye.
Oh, relax and close my eyes.
You smart. Must be good lawyer.
You say george michael
have great meaning to you.
Uh, i-I say george michael
was in my living room.
He doesn't have great meaning.
Yes. You no remember.
I no remember because he doesn't.
You must make peace george michael.
Maybe i should call his publicist.
Ah!
Dr. Chen help you remember.
Is this your first time?
No, i...
well, h-H-How would
you define "first time"?
I thought so.
Okay, we need some music.
Oh, my god, eli. You have
a george michael album?
What are you doing with
a george michael album?
It's my roommate's. He's in theater.
Whoa, i-I-I-I can't lose
it to george michael.
Well, we can just make out
then. Or it could, you know,
Make the whole
experience... more memorab.
You're cute, eli,
In a geeky, late
bloomer-Ish sort of way.
Lo. Bed
Mm...
not yet, you haven't, but you will.
By the time you're that
lawyer changing the world,
You are gonna be hot.
C.L.A., 1991. You were
lizzie then, not beth.
Your hair was straight, and
we had sex to george michael.
It was 15 years ago, but it was
you. My hair was never straight.
????
Why didn't you say something?
'Cause it was one night,
And it's not like you remembered me.
Come on, eli, we were
both stoned on pot brownies
And we had a random college hookup.
So you just used me for sex ???
Like most guys want? I'm not most guys.
No, you're just most
lawyers. That's not fair.
Hey, ben?
Ben, this is eli. Eli's
a friend of mommy's.
He's not, uh...
i--I'm
not...
yeah...
i was pregnant for 8 years.
Sweetie?
Can you please say hello?
Huh?
So you like blocks, huh?
Words. There's over 500,000
in the english language.
Wow, that's a lot.
They should collect them
all in a book or something.
That's not counting names.
I'm counting them with names.
Oh.
what is it, eli?
Uh, come by my office tomorrow at 10:00.
Wh--You're gonna
take the case?
No, i'm gonna be getting fired
'Cause i'm gonna request to
take the case. Oh, look,???
But not if it's out of pity or
sympathy. It's--It's not sympathy.
Uh, there's over 500,000 words
in the english language, and...
that's not counting names.
George michael
Bear with me, mr. Stone.
I don't understand.
Is there some kind of
problem with the case?
No, the case is going great.
The sole exception being
that you wish to switch sides.
W-We represent clients
with conflicting interests
All the time.
Is that the japanese wall you
were talking about? It's chinese.
Whichever. In those
situations, the clients can pay.
I'm fine.
Totally fine.
Mr. Dowd, you're atypicay quiet. Yeah.
Sorry, i was just redecorating
stone's office in my head.
Ordinarily, we offer quixotic plaintiffs
Nuisance value to go away.
We did. Stone upped
the offer to $90,000.
$100,000, actually.
She came by my office.
Let me see if i'm understanding this.
You had an ex parte
conversation with the plaintiff?
Uhwell, it wouldn't be ex parte
If you let me represent her... sir.
Explain to me, mr. Stone,
The rationale for upsettg a
client of beutel's magnitude
On a case which is a
complete and utter loser?
Well, because, sir...
it'll make us rich.
More rich.
We all know that pro bono
work is good for business,
And this case,
As you so correctly
pointed out, mr. Wethersby,
Is a complete and utter loser.
Therefore, the firm
can reap the financial
And the public relations windfalls
Without putting our bottom line at risk.
What is this i hea
About the seven horsemen
of the apocalypse
Actually letting you represent
that woman? Her name's beth.
Now ask dan to get me
points and authorities
There it is again. You hear that?
Who was it this time, hmm?
Cyndi lauper? Billy joel? The
go-Go's? It's not music. It's, uh...
like a bell, a dinging. Did you
possibly fall down a flight of stairs,
Or did you start taking ecstasy?
Maybe you fell down a flight
of stairs because you are
High on ecstasy. Wh...
hold on!
all aboard! Hold on!
Let him on.
come on, eli! Hurry up!
Come on, eli!
There was a voice this time.
I'm pretty sure it was my dead father.
Hmm. Dead parent. Different needle.
You don't understand.
My fatr was an aimless drunk
Who ruined everything he ever toucd.
He's, like, the last perso
I need to be hearing from right now.
No good hate dead people.
Relah. Think good memory father.
Dr. Chen help ungrateful son.
come on, eli!
Hurry up!
Hey, your mom told me
about your debate trophy.
Sorry i couldn't be there.
Because you were drunk again.
Here.
A celebration present for
winning the tournament.
It's the panch chuli
peaks. They're in india.
I always wanted to see them.
We'll go some day.
"For eli,
So you'll remember."
Remember what?
That you're meant to do great things,
That you're gonna go
to beautiful places,
Speak inspired words,
That you're gonna help people.
Dad, you okay?
Yeah.
yeah. Sure, kiddo.
Hey, uh, there's one more
stop i gotta make, actually.
Tell your mother i'll
be home in a little bit.
??? He barely ever cried or got fussy.
Picked himself up at 10
months and walked at 12.
But at 23 months,
everything changed--
Right after i took him
in for his 2-Year checkup
And his pediatrician gave him
A beutel pharmaceutical flu shot.
Within a week, he was a
totally different child.
He went from smiling all
the time to not at all.
He used to run around the
house like a live wire,
And now his idea of playtime
is stacking objects in rows.
And when he calls for me,
which he hardly ever does...
he calls me beth.
Uh, your honor... "he calls me beth"?
Mr. Stone, please approach.
Are you mr. Stone?
I figured i could hear this.
An overestimation on my part.
Now i'm... walking away.
Your honor,
We both know t only chance
i have is for the jurors
To identify with my client on an
emotional level. Not my problem.
My decision to let you represent
the kellers in the first place
Should've come wrapped in
a box with a ribbon on it.
Do you understand?
You're drawing an analogy
Between your decision
and a gift, your honor.
But, ms. Keller,
Isn't a leap to blame a
vaccine for ben's autism?
That vaccine changed my son.
One week, he was happy and healthy,
And the next week, he was autistic.
What kind of c.E.O. Would i be--
What kind of human would i be--
If i allowed my mpany
To use a preservative in its
vaccine that caused autism?
Well, why not just get
rid of the preservative
Just to be sure?
Because then i couldn't
market the vaccine
At an affordable cost.
Look, i'm a parent myself.
And believe me, no level
of risk is acceptable.
But there is no risk
because there's no connection
Which between mercuritol and autism.
Beth keller said
Her son became autistic one
week after exposure to it.
The truth is, no one
knows what causes autism.
???
Ms. Keller has blamed
my company and a product
That has saved the lives of
tens of thousands of children.
We're gonna lose, aren't we?
I'm sorry if by
repeatedly telling you how
We have no chance of
winning i got your hopes up.
Maybe sean was right.
My ex--He said all
the money in the world
Wasn't gonna make ben better,
That i was obsessed
with our son's illness
And i should give up. Is
that why you guys split?
Ours wasn't a ad-Bearing
marriage to begin with.
But after ben was diagnosed,
there was just no way.
i hope
i'm interrupting something.
We'd better get going. Come on, ben.
What a nice woman.
Cute, too. Is she available?
I'm ignoring you.
What's that? A "please
break off your engagement,
I'm begging you" present. It's
an internal beutel document.
Gee, thanks, patti. You shouldn't have.
"...Suggests a possible correlation
"Betweenercuritol and
cognitive dysfunction,
Including autism."
Th is a study.
Proving even they thought
mercuritol might be dangerous.
Patti, where'd y get this?
A paralegal who works with matt dowd.
I lent her my tampons when she ran out.
First, ew.
And second, do you have
any idea what you've done?
This--This document's
attorney-Client privilege.
I can't use it. I can't
even know about it.
I could get fired and
disbarred and killed,
And not even in that order.
Don't whisper-Yell at me.
Well, don't try to get me fired.
Well, you're the genius
with the stanford diploma.
Figure something out. God!
So his father d i went
outside to find eli...
naked, covered in feathers
and chocolate syrup.
Thanks, mom. And thank you, too.
Oh, come on. I was 10.
Just be glad i couldn't find tar.
that
would be my parents.
Ah! Mm-Hmm.
Eli.
Hi. Mmm.
Eli mr. Wethersby--
Um... jordan.
sweetheart. Mwah.
mwah. Your
place is just darling.
Hello, princess. Hey, daddy.
Hello. Mmm. Mwah.
You're a brave man, eli.
For getting engaged
to the boss' daughter?
That's not bravery. That's stupidity.
I meant taking on the beutel matter.
I would have to agree,
Particularly since beutel's lawyers
Have been dealing from
the bottom of the deck.
If you're referring to the beutel study,
Which i suspect you are, be careful.
It's an ethical violation
For you to be in possession
of it. Well, it was a violation
For you not to produce
it in the first place,
So i guess that makes us even.
In point of fact, i
didn't have to produce it.
At least, not after one of
my associates stepped forward
To take the plaintiff's case,
Effectively allowing
me to seal it behind--
What's it called again? A chinese wall?
In any case, that's why
i'll be in court tomorrow.
Congratulations on the engagement.
It'll be a pleasure to
have you in the family.
Look at me! Look at me! Listen!
Just come down, please!
What are you doing?! Please!
Look at me! Listen to me!
Get off. Step down. Step down
Please, eli! Come down! Don't!
You did last night, i
realized that i had, uh,
I had seen that kind of behavior before.
We both have...
with dad--Hallucinations,
seeing people,
Hearing things that aren't there.
Just stop me when this doesn't
sound familiar. I don't understand.
What does this all have
to do with your father?
Well, i'd always associated
his episodes with alcohol,
But it seems pretty clear
That he was suffering
from something else.
There was just no way
of knowing it back then.
I took your m.R.I. To
our neurology chief,
And, um...
he found something.
He found what?
A brain aneurysm.
It's about, uh, 3 millimeters in size.
We wouldn't have found it
unless we knew what to look for.
Now intracranial aneurysms
can be hereditary.
It is not uncommon for them to
afflict the same of the brain
In a parent and a child.
And in this case, it is in
the right cerebral artery.
Any disruption of
blood flow in this area
Would account for, uh,
Delusions of grandeur or hallucinations.
Uh...
wh-When do you take it out?
Because it is located
so deep in the cortex,
According to the...
chief neurosurgeon,
It is not amenable to
surgical intervention.
What if it bursts?
It might not.
No, a lot of people
Live their whole lives with aneurysms,
And then they die
of perfectly bor--
perfectly boring things.
I'm so sorry, eli.
I'll let you two talk.
Well, we should probably
move the wedding up.
That's not funny.
I don't know if i can do this, eli.
You know, visions,
the odd behavior--
I could take all that.
The idea of losing you at any moment...
are--Are you
breaking up with me?
'Cause i-I was just diagnosed
with a brain aneurysm,
And that would be really
bad timing on your part.
I am just trying to process all of this.
okay.
Eli, where are you going?
I'm late for court.
The plaintiff recalls alan cooke.
What's your child's name, sir?
Objection. Earlier, mr. Cooke
mentioned having a child.
He oped the door. Overruled.
Your child's name, sir? Jenna.
Did jenna ever receive a flu
vaccine? Several, i'm sure.
Were any of them manufactured
by beutel pharmaceuticals?
Objection! Objection!
Hell, no. Now we're gettin' somewhere.
Well, mr. Cooke?
I believe the choice of vaccine
Was jenna's pediatrician's decision.
Mr. Cooke, do you recognize
the man in the glasses
Who just entered the room?
That's dr. Varga, jenna's pediatrician.
Or as i prefer to call
him, my next witness.
Now i'm going to ask you
one more time, mr. Cooke.
To the best of your knowledge,
Did jenna ever receive a beutel vaccine?
No, she did not.
Was that at your request, sir?
Yes. It was.
We're prepared to offer $360,000.
Sealed.
No admission of liability.
Check by the end of business.
I'm sorry. No.
No what? No, i don't accept.
I want mercuritol taken
out of beutel's vaccines,
And i want them to set up a fund
For any other kids it made autistic.
Could you guys give us a few minutes?
beth, what
i did in there was a stunt.
Matt's gonna go back in,
He's gonna clean up
the mess that i made.
Now we're down to summations here,
And i'd have to give the one of my life
And get struck by lightning
for us to have a chance.
But i'm not gonna take their bribe.
If you don't take the offer,
you're going to nothing.
Nothing. Wow, yeah.
Okay, you--You're right.
We're gonna lose,
But not because of matt dowd
or beutel or burdens of proof.
We are gonna lose
Because when you stand up
to give the closing argument,
The jury's gonna look in your eyes,
And they're gonna see
that you don't believe.
For the first time,
I feel sorrier for you than i do for me.
Come on, ben.
You always show up no appointment.
Dr. Chen not jiffy
lube. Come back friday.
I went to the
doctor-- The real kind.
You wouldn't, uh, happen
to have any needles
For an inoperable brain aneurysm
I inherited from my alcoholic father
Who i've wrongly hated for 20 years?
oh, wow.
That totally blows, bro.
What happened to your accent?
Long story. Want a beer?
I grew up on a commune.
From there, u.C.
Berkeley-- Philosophy major.
There's no future in
existentialist ethics,
So i got into acupuncture.
Unfortunately, nobody wants
An acupuncturist named frank lebakowski.
They want incense,
mystique, a foreign accent.
Yeah, they want the dr. Chen.
That's great--Even my
treatments were imaginary.
Hey, eight years of coursework
in holistic medicine,
Two years in beijing.
Give me some props.
Now tell me about this latest
vision. Ah, it's just pointless.
It's all just my defective
brain playing tricks on me.
Everything has two
explanations, eli--
The scientific and the divine.
It's up to us to choose
which one we buy into.
Now science explains
The enlarged vessel in your head.
But does it explain how the
girl you lost your virginity to
Happened to be suing your law firm?
How her son happen to
spell out a message to you
With his blocks? Okay, so what would your
divine explanation for all of this be?
Almost all religions believe that
There are those who are sent
to us to help us find our way.
Some people call them prophets.
A prophet. You think i'm a prophet?
Like moses?
God told moses he'd send a
prophet to every generation.
Why not a lawyer-- A
high profile attorney
Handling cases that
got a lot of notoriety,
That the world would read about?
The difference between those guys and me
Is i don't believe in god.
Sure you do.
You believe in right and wrong.
You believe in justice, in fairness.
And you believe in love.
All those things--
They're god, eli.
that's god, too.
The first lawsuit
Alleging a connection
between tobacco and cancer
Was filed in 1954.
But it took 30 years for a
jury to award a single dollar
For something we now all
accept as patently true.
Is there proof mercuritol
causes autism? Yes.
Is that proof direct or
incontrovertible proof? No.
But ask yourself
If you've ever believed
in anything, in anyone,
Without absolute proof.
That's called faith,
ladies and gentlemen.
And make no mistake,
This is very much a case about faith.
It's about beth keller's faith.
She placed her faith in beutel
when she exposed her child
To a vaccine mr. Cooke
wouldn't give his own daughter.
She placed her faith
in the justice system
To hold beutel accountable,
And now she's here,
Putting that same unshakable faith
In the 12 of you.
I don't have beth keller's faith,
But i do believe in some things.
I believe in people.
That's why i became a lawyer.
I believe that most people
wanna do what's right.
And the right thing to do here
Is to remove mercuritol
from beutel's vaccines.
Unfortunately,our verdict...
can't order them to do that.
Is award beth keller a judgment so high
That beutel feels it
has no other choice.
Sadly,
Without that verdict, i...
don't have faith that
beutel will do what's right.
But i have faith that you will.
How much longer?
Uh, juries don't award millions
of dollars in five minutes.
So for us, it's the longer the better.
eli.
Someone came by the office.
Mom.
Your brother told me
everything. Oh, i'm so sorry.
Are you all ght?
I'm fine. Yeah?
Yeah. Apart from the,
you know, aneurysm. Oh.
Oh.
I had no idea.
It's horrible to think
how much of my life
I've spent blaming your father
For something that wasn't
his fault. Yeah, me, too.
It sure helps to explain a lot.
That's the coffee can!
Where did you get that?
It's your father. It's his ashes.
You kept dad in a coffee can?
No, of course not.
I transported him in the coffee can.
I didn't want
To traipse a 10-Pound
china urn across town.
Honey,
He wanted you to have this...
him.
In his will,
He expressed a desire to be cremated.
He wanted you to have the ashes.
He said that one day, you
would know what to do with them.
Of course, i thought that was
the request of a crazy person,
And i didn't want to burden you.
But now...
i'm hoping you'll know
what to do with them.
I think i do.
Jury's back.
That quick?
Mom, i gotta go.
it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
I love you. Okay.
Patti, take my dad back to the office.
I am not gonna even
pretend to understand that.
Good luck.
You've never wished me luck before.
I never cared whether you won before.
I--Neither
did i.
Has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, your honor.
As to the claim of product liability,
We find in favor of the plaintiff...
and order the defendant to pay damages
In the amount of $5.2 million.
You heard that, too, right?
'Cause i've been hearing
some things lately.
No, i heard it.
Okay, we all know what happens next.
We appeal, appeal the appeal,
appeal the appealof the appeal.
Basically, run this thing out
Till little ben's eligible for
social security. That's a nice try,
But beutel can't risk an appeal
Because they can't risk the
publicity. Speak quickly, mr. Stone.
$2 million to the kellers,
the balance of the judgment
Gets invested in a fund
for autistic children,
And mercuritol is removed
from beutel's vaccines,
Effective immediately
Write it up.
Wait, one more thing.
Eli keeps his job.
He just won a multimillion
dollar jury verdict.
We'd be hard-Pressed to
explain letting him go.
???
Shrewd. I'll have mr. Dowd draft it up.
Honestly, i-I don't
know how to thank you.
Well, i think you just did
With the "i keeps his job" bit.
that was nothing.
You changed our lives.
Well, i think i'm gonna
Be making a few changes to mine, too.
Don't be a stranger,
okay? And thank you.
The man of the hour. It's
all over the courthouse.
What, that i'm back on the market?
It wasn't exactly my finest moment
At the doctor's office.
But i am sorry, eli,
And i love you.
I love you, too,
And i wanna be with you.
But...
but?
I have to go to india.
Right this minute, or...
are you free for lunch?
who aren't really that mystical
and aren't really that chinese.
I have a feeling that's
just the beginning.
Mom said
You spent your whole
life with these visions.
I had no idea.
I'm soy, dad.
I'm sorry for blaming you
For things that weren't your fault.
Most of all, i'm sorry that
I'm not the person that you said i'd be.
I'm gonna change that.
I promise.
Okay, guys.
Let's go.
