- Leave Molly alone.
- You wanna make something out of it?
- C
-
- Stop it!
Lay offJuly! If Hannigan wakes up,
she'll get sore.
It's okay, Molly.
You were just having another nightmare.
I want my mommy
and daddy.
And we ain't ever gonna have 'em.
That's why we're called orphans.
I'm not an orphan!
My parents are alive,
and they're comin' to get me someday.
Yeah, and Annie's got
a note that proves it.
- Please?
- Brother, here we go again.
"Please take good care of
our little darling. Her name is Annie.
- She was born..."
- Was born on October 28.
We will be back to get her soon.
We have left half of a silver locket
around her neck...
and kept the other half,
so that when we come back
for her, you will know...
that she's our baby!
Do you wanna sleep with y! Our teeth
your mouth or out?
Now get to sleep!
I know these don't mean anything to you,
but they're everything to me.
They're proof I got parents.
Do you really think
they're out there, Annie?
Yep.
And I'm gonna
meet 'em someday.
# Maybe far away #
# Or maybe real nearby #
# He may be pouring
her coffee #
# She may be straightening
his tie #
# Maybe in a house #
#All hidden by a hill #
# She's sittin'
playin' piano #
# He's sittin'
payin' a bill #
# Betcha they're young
Betcha they're smart #
# Bet they collect things
like ashtrays and art #
# Betcha they're good
Why shouldn't they be #
#Their one mistake #
#Was giving up me #
# So maybe now it's time #
#And maybe when I wake #
#They'll be there
calling me baby #
# Maybe #
# Betcha he reads
Betcha she sews #
# Maybe she's made me
a closet of clothes #
# Maybe they're strict
as straight as a line #
# Don't really care #
#As long as they're mine #
# So maybe now this prayer's #
#The last one of its kind #
#Won't you please
come get your baby #
# Maybe ##
- Now what?
- If my folks haven't found me,
I'm gonna find them.
- Again?
- Pepper, watch out for Molly!
- But what if Miss Hannigan catches you?
- She won't.
Boo. Trying to make
a break... again.
- What the heck are you doing?
- Aren't you gonna
beat the tar out of me?
Have I ever hit any of ya?
No, but you've threatened.
That's worse.
I know.
Kid, if any of you think
it's bad in here, it's  out there.
I'm doin' you a favor
by not lettin' you go.
- What do you say?
- I love you, Miss Hannigan.
- I can't hear ya!
- I love you, Miss Hannigan!
- Rotten orphan.
- I'm not an orphan!
My parents left me with a note
saying they'd come back for me.
That was 1922.
This is 1933.
You're an orphan.
- Rise and shine! Rise and shine!
-
But it's in the middle
of the night.
Don't you think I know that?
Annie here tried to run away... again.
So as a little
welcome home party,
you're all gonna clean this dump
till it shines like the top
of the Chrysler Building.
- What do you say?
-
We love you, Miss Hannigan.
And I love you.
Now, scrub these floors.
Strip them beds for the laundry man.
Get to work!
Now!

- Good morning, children.

Good morning, Miss Hannigan.
- What the heck?
- What are you doin' in there?
- Nothin'.
Your days are numbered.
Get her out of there.
Mornin', kids!
-  Mornin', Mr. Bundles!
- Morning, Miss Aggie!
Okay, kids, clean sheets once a month,
whether you need them or not.
-  Thank you, Mr. Bundles.
-
Oh, Miss Aggie, I live for laundry day
here at your fine establishment.
Bundles,
you're full of applesauce.
- How come?
'Cause I'm savin' myself
for Oliver Warbucks.
Now get the lousy laundry.
Get the heck outta here.
Oh, very well.
So long, fair Aggie.
And Merry Christmas to all!
Bye, Mr. Bundles!
Miss Hannigan, may we please
have our breakfast now?
- No. You  have it later.
-
There's a rush order
of dresses you gotta finish.
You'll eat after you're done
at your sewing machines.
That is,  you done
a good job.
Roll call!

Miss Hannigan,
Annie ain't here.
Really?
Where is she?
Mr. Bundles rolled her out
with the dirty laundry.
What?
There she is!
Where is she?
Stop that truck!
Come back, Bundles.
Come back!
Somebody help me!
Go away!
- Yea! Annie made it!

Excuse me, I'm looking
for my parents.
Pardon me, do you know anybody
who kinda looks like me?
- Sir!
Hot corn!
Five cents!
- Gee, it smells great.
- Tastes better.
- Wish I had a nickel.
- Wish I had a nickel
for every time someone said,
"Wish I had a nickel."
Ow!
Bitin' me!
Let's drop these at the pound and
take our lunch break somewheres warm.
Hey, come back here!
That's mine!
Oh, go on.
Eat up.
What's wrong? Are they chasing
you 'cause you're looking
for your mom and dad too?
Don't worry.
It's gonna be okay.
Sometimes it seems like the only thing
you've got is trouble.
But things'll get better.
They just gotta.
#The sun'll come out
tomorrow #
# Bet your bottom dollar

# Clears away the cobwebs

- Every dog for himself.
- I said, hey you!
- Yes, sir?
Not you. The you with four legs.
Freeze!
- What's the problem, sir?
- This mutt keeps giving
the dog catcher the slip.
- Oh, you don't have to
turn him in, Officer.
- See, he's  dog.
Well, how come I seen him
around and not you?
Me?
Well, I don't get out much.
Well, uh,
what's your dog's name?
Name?
Oh, that's easy.
I call him...
Sandy!
That's right.
Sandy, 'cause his fur's
a nice, sandy color.
Sandy, huh?
Well, why don't you call him?
- Call him?
- Yeah,
By his name...
Sandy.
Gee, I would. Only sometimes
Sandy forgets his name is Sandy.
- Just call your dog.
Sandy!
Here, Sandy!
Come on, boy!
Thattaboy.
Good Sandy.
All right, then.
Next time I see you, Sandy better
have a leash and license.
- Otherwise he goes to the pound
for an eternal sleep.
- Yes, sir.
Now get home before you catch
pneumonia in this cold.
Oh, it doesn't bother me.

Hey, anybody in here?
We're not here, okay?
Hey, down there!
You know the law... no loitering.
We ain't loiterin', Officer.
We're holdin' a meetin'.
Yeah,
for the Millionaires' Club.
Yeah, well, I suggest you move it
to your Park Avenue address,
or else I'll have you arrested
for trespassing.
Let's be good citizens and move along.
Let's go. Come on, everybody, let's go.
Move! Let's go!
Let's go. You too.
- C
- C
You!
Where's the leash and license?
- Run for it, Sandy!
-
Hey, Flatfoot,
bet you can't catch me!
You take the mutt.
I'll take the kid.
Hey, you, short stuff!
Hold up!
Get back here!
I was worried sick,
Officer!
- I don't know whatever
I'd do without ya.
- Scrub the floors yourself?
Of all my little girls, Annie here is my
favorite. Thanks for bringing her back.
Well, seein' as she means that much to
you, ma'am, I guess I don't mind...
that I spent the whole night
chasing after her.
Well, if there's anything
I can do to repay you, Officer.
- Well, actually, there is.
There was thing mangy mutt
with her that got away.
He comes sniffin' around, give a holler,
and he's off to the pound.
Oh, yes, sir.
You can count on me, sir.
For anything.
Ta-ta.
All right, the show's over!
Back to your rooms!
And you... If the Board of Orphans
finds out about this,
they'll start nosin' around here
and I could lose my job.
But I thought
you  your job.
Oh, no, I love my b.
It's  I hate.
You wait here.
I'm gonna go cook up your punishment.
- And it's gonna be a doozy.
- Miss Hannigan, Miss Hannigan!
We saw a mouse!
A mouse!
- Do I look like the exterminator?
- There it is! Up there!
- No, it's there!
- I tell ya, it's there!

Out of my sight!
All of ya! Scram!
Ow!

I don't want you
ever to do this again,
so you're gonna scrub
every inch of this dump... with this.
- Glad you're back?
- Yes, Miss Hannigan.
Liar! What's the one thing
I always taught you?
Never tell a lie.
- That's right.
Excuse me. I was told I'd find
a Miss Hannigan here.
- And who might you be?
- I'm Grace Farrow. The City
Board of Orphans said...
Look, it was all a mistake. Somehow,
Annie got in the laundry basket.
Well, one thing led to another,
and I had to call the cops.
Please don't fire me!
I think you must have me
confused with somebody else.
Oh, I get it.
Uh, listen, honey, if you're peddlin'
beauty products, I don't need any.
Miss Hannigan,
I do not peddle anything.
I'm personal secretary
to Mr. Oliver Warbucks.
Oliver Warbucks?
- Yes.
- The richest man in the world?
- Yes.
The Board of Orphans
sent me here...
to extend Mr. Warbucks'
personal invitation to an orphan...
I'm an orphan.
I can be ready in five minutes.
An orphan
Perhaps a child like this one.
Great idea. I'm a child,
and I'm an orphan.
A liar!
Annie ain't no orphan.
She's my little girl,
and she's nothing but trouble.
That seems hard to believe.
Look, you can have any orphan
in the joint, only you can't have Annie.
If this has something to do
with the laundry or the police,
perhaps the Board of Orphans
should know.
She's all yours.
- Merry Christmas.
- Good.
If you'll just sign the paperwork
and get Annie's coat.
Coat? Why would
a kid need a coat?
- We'll buy you one at Bergdorf's
on the way uptown.
- Really?
- Bergdorf's? Well, ain't we fancy?
-
- You'll never guess what happened.
- I get to go away for Christmas.
-
Bye, Annie! Bye!

Everybody!
Everybody,
this is our
Christmas guest, Annie.
Annie, this is...
everybody.
Hello, everybody.
Did Mr. Warbucks' plane
arrive yet?
He called from Teeterboro.
His airplane's been delayed,
but he's on his way.
- May I take your coat, miss?
- Will I get it back?
-
- Of course you will, honey.
Now tell me, what would you like
to do first?
The floors. I'll scrub them,
and then I'll do the windows!
No, Annie, Annie!
You're Mr. Warbucks' guest.
- You're here to have fun.
- Really?
Really. Now, we've ordered in
special things just for you.
Mr. Warbucks instructed me to make sure
that for the next two weeks...
you have a swell time here.
# Cecile will pick out
all your clothes #
You mean I get
to wear new things?
#Your bath is drawn

#Your wish is our command #
- #We know you're gonna #
- # I know I'm gonna #
# Like it here ##
- Who are you?
- I'm Annie.
Don't ask me about my trip.
It was a nightmare.
My factories are shutting down
right and left. It's bad, very bad.
I'll be in my study.
Mrs. Pugh, bring me a sandwich.
President Roosevelt phoned. He's
awaiting your call at the White House.
Fine.
- What did you say your name was?
- Annie, sir.
Is there any particular reason
why you're here?
With all the negative press
you've been receiving, sir.
- Oh, yes, right.
- Annie is the orphan
you invited for Christmas.
- You're a girl. Orphans are boys.
- You didn't specify boy, sir.
Aw, gee, Mr. Warbucks, sir,
that's okay.
You can trade me in
for a boy.
I really liked seeing your house.
It sure is big.
Annie,
I couldn't be
more delighted...
that you'll be spending Christmas
here with me in my big house.
What are we
supposed to do with her?
Well, it is Annie's
first night here, so...
Then come to my club
for dinner and cigars.
Sir, your club is
for men only.
- And I don't smoke.
- I see.
- Then how about a brandy?
- How about a Broadway show?
Gee, I've never been
to one of those before.
Then you'll attend
a Broadway show... with Grace.
I thought
you were going out.
Oh, yes, well, see,
Mr. Warbucks,
I've never met anybody with a real job,
except Mr. Bundles,
so I'd kinda like
to watch you work.
Fine. Sometime
when I'm not busy.
Sir, you're never not busy.
Oh.
All right.
Well, that's about it.
Good-bye.
Couldn't I watch
just a few more minutes?
My assessment of the situation,
Mr. President? Well, it's
pretty darned bad out there.
My factories... everybody's factories...
are shutting down.
Mr. President, I know
you're feeling pressure.
I'm feeling pressure myself
at this very moment.
You're coming to New York
for the holidays?
- Invite him for Christmas!
- Why don't you and Mrs. Roosevelt...
Excellent!
He said yes!
That's wonderful news.
So the President of the United States
is coming to your house for Christmas?
For Christmas dinner.
I wonder what Democrats eat.
Let's go out and celebrate with Annie.
We'll show her the town.
- Too much work, Grace.
- That's okay, sir.
I've never seen New York before,
so I'm just as happy to watch you work.
You're telling me you live in New York
City and haven't seen the place?
- Miss Hannigan...
- She runs the orphanage.
Well, she never lets
us kids out.
What's New York City like
anyway?
Well, it's...
Hmm?
Let me think.
N.Y.C.

I heard you right,
Miss Personal Secretary
to  Oliver Warbucks.
My Annie is going to be adopted
by your millionaire?
Actually,
he's a b
and, yes, he's going
to tell her tonight.
Well, ain't she
the lucky one.
Yes, well, if you'll
just sign here.
Sure. Would you excuse me
for one moment, please?
Now, where were we?
- Hey, sis.
-
- Glad to see me?
- Don't it show?
Did they let you out of prison
this time, or did you "excape"?
- I cut a deal with the warden.
- Rooster,
you're the only con I know
who could con a cop.
Thanks. Hey!
Meet my new gal.
- Lily... Lily...
- St. Regis.
- St. Regis.
Lily St. Regis.
I'm named after the hotel.
Oh, which floor?
Oh, real nice place
you got here.
Gee, I don't know.
Spill it, Rooster.
What do you want?
Me and Lily was
in the neighborhood and...
Ten bucks to tide me over?
Ten bucks?
I ain't got ten cents.
Get out and take
the St. Regis here with you.
Hey, wait a minute.
You mean, after all your
crooked schemes, all you got
is lint in your pockets?
- Look who's talkin'.
- I'm doin'just fine, thank you.
Oh, no, sis,
you're doin'
like I'm doin'.
Lousy.
Aggie,
how come us Hannigans ended up
with the fuzzy end of the lollipop?
# I remember the way
our sainted mother #
#Would sit and croon us
a lullaby #
# She'd say, Kids, there's a place
that's like no other #
#You gotta get there
before you die #
#You don't get there by playin'
from the rule book #
- Uh-uh.
#You stack the aces #
- Mm-hmm.
#You load the dice #
# Mother, dear, oh, we know, you're #
# Down there listenin' #
# How can we follow #
#Your sweet advice #
#To #
# Easy Street #
# Easy Street #
#Where ya sleep

So, sis, who was the hot tomato
in the fancy car?
Personal secretary

Oliver Warbucks?
millionaire?

Lives up on Fifth Avenue.
Hey, Warbucks don't live

So, sis, what did
the secretary want?
Tell me Warbucks is going to adopt
Annie, this rotten orphan I despise.
Now the lousy kid's
gonna have everything.

# It ain't fair
This here life is drivin' me nuts #
#While we get peanuts #
# She's livin' fat #
# Maybe she holds the key
this little lady #
#To gettin' more bucks #
- # Instead of less #
-
# Maybe we fix the game
with somethin' shady #
Where would that
put us?
- Aw, tell her.
- Give ya one guess.
Ye-e-s!

- Here you go, sir.
- Oh, good.
- Everything all right?
- Well, you know.
You're gonna do fine, sir.
Just tell her how you feel...
- and speak from your heart.
- I'll try.
Mrs. Pugh said we could have
a picnic right here.
That sounds delightful.
Annie, before we eat,
there's something
I want to ask you.
But first... Did you know
that I was an orphan?
No, sir.
I lost my parents
when I was very young, and,
well, from that day on,
I vowed to work very hard
and become very rich.
- And that's just what he did.
- Yes.
But, Annie,
l-l-I never realized...
- U-Until he met you...
- Exactly.
I mean, what's life about...
if you don't have anyone
to share it with?
- D-Do you follow me?
- Sure.
No, not really.
Oh.
Maybe this will
explain it better.
Oh, gee, thank you, sir.
L-I noticed that old broken one
you always wear,
and I thought, off with the old,
on with the new.
No!
I don't want a new one!
My mom and dad left me
with this one...
and a note saying
they'd come back for me someday.
you've been real nice to me,
but all I want
is my parents.
I understand.
I do, child.
If it's your parents you want,
then I'll find them for you.
But I'll need your locket
and that note...
so the F.B.I. Can trace them
to your mother and dad.
even if he has to pull
every string, right up to the
President of the United States.
Thank you, sir.
we're going to find
your parents.
We are.
I think I'd like to write
to the kids about this. Okay?
Of course.

#And maybe when I wake #
#They'll be there

And so, Annie, as we come to the end of
another program, we'd like to thank you.
-  Thank you, Mr. Healey.
- It's Annie on the radio!
- Who cares?
- Shh!
Oliver Warbucks is offering
$50,000...
$ 50,000!
This is Burt Healey saying,
smile, darn ya, smile.
- Good night!

- That's my favorite.
You're a bunch of saps. Who cares if
Annie was on the radio?
- I do.
- Me too.

- That's more like it.
- Miss Hannigan, Annie was on the radio.
They're sending out a search call
for Annie's parents.
And there's
a $50,000 reward.
- Well, how do you like them apples?
- Isn't it great?
Great. Get to bed
before I paddle ya.
But what about our dinner?
- What about it?
- You didn't give us any.
'Cause I knew you was gonna be bad
tonight, so I punished ya ahead of time.
Now scatter.
$50,000 reward.
I hate that kid so much
I could be her mother.
- Excuse me.
- If you're gonna rob the place,
start by taking the orphans.
Actually, miss, the wife and l...
We're Ralph and Shirley Mudge,
by the way.
- We were looking
for whoever runs this place.
- You're lookin' at her.
Then, um, maybe
you can help us.
You see,
about 11 years ago,
we left
our little baby here.
She was a little boy.
I mean, girl.
It's just so hard to tell when they
don't have no hair. Right, honey?
You mean,
you're Annie's parents?
- Yes.
- I don't believe it.
I told you
she wouldn't believe us.
Wait a minute!
- Rooster!
- You got to admit it, sis,
we fooled you, huh?
Right up until when
your girlfriend there opened her trap.
- Rooster, you sure know how to pick 'em.
- Don't he though?
Aggie, we're gonna blow
this town with all the dough
we'll ever need. I got a plan.
- I bet it's foolproof.
We're gonna fool Warbucks
and grab those 50 G's.
You and every other con artist
this side of the Hudson.
Yep, but those other cons ain't got
an artiste workin' over in Brooklyn...
- making fake birth certificates.
- Keep talkin'.
And those other cons
ain't got a sister...
who knows all there is to know
about the kid.
Yeah, yeah, I know
all about Annie.
I also know Miss St. Regis here ain't
got the brains for the job.
She makes one slip, and we all end up
behind bars for life.
- Yeah, you're right. Lily's out.
- And I'm in. Sorry, sister.
- Now about the 50 grand...
Here's the split.
Half for me, half for you two.
- Deal.
- You wanna be cut out
of the deal completely?
- Heck, no!
Then stop whinin'.
- One last detail, Rooster.
- Shoot!
Annie... Once we got the kid,
what do we do with her?
I make her disappear.
Then we head
straight for...
Straight for where,
Rooster?
# Easy Street #
# Easy Street #
#That's where we're gonna #
# Be ##
Well, let's hope
for the best.
We're her real parents!
We're her real parents!
and any specific details
will be most helpful.
Sir, I think every liar,
thief and crackpot...
showed up
on our doorstep today.
So many sob stories, but nobody
mentioned giving Annie the locket.
Did they show up yet?
It appears that everyone who claims
they were your parents are fakes.
Oh. Well, I'm sure
my real parents'll show up.
Maybe they missed their train
or got lost or something.
Sir, this just arrived
via special messenger from the F.B.I.
Good. The information
about Annie's locket.
"Between 1918 and 1924,
were made and sold."
The F.B.I. Says it's impossible
to trace your parents through it.
I'm so, so very sorry.
Drake, let's you and I
check on the Christmas menu.
You did the best
you could, sir.
You know, I guess a kid
can do okay without parents.
Looks like you got
everything  wanted.
I'm afraid
that isn't so, Annie.
# I've made me a fortune #
#That fortune made ten #
# Been headlined
and profiled #
#Again and again #
# But something
was missing #
# I never quite knew #
#That something was someone #
# But who #
# My speeches are greeted #
#With thunderous acclaim #
#At two universities #
# Bearing my name #
#Yes, something was missing #
# Each time I got through #
#That something was someone #
# But who #
#Who could #
#That someone be #
# How could she make it #

#Who would need me #
# For me #
# Need me for me #
#Alone #
Annie,
I love you as if you were
my own little girl.
I want to adopt you.
Would you consider it?
It's just that I love
my real mother and father so much.
I don't know if I could love
anybody else.
I understand,
but if you could find
a place in your heart for me...
#The world was
my oyster #
# But where was
the pearl #
#Who dreamed
I would find it #
# In one little girl #
#Yes, something
was missing #
# But dreams
do come true #
#That something #
# Is no one #
# But you #
Mr. Warbucks, if I can't
have my real parents,
I think I'd really like it
if you'd be my father.
I have an idea.
Grace!
- Yes, Mr. Warbucks.
Is everything all right?
- C
TelephoneJustice Brandeis
and ask him to come over
to sign the adoption papers.
Oh!
That's wonderful news!
Oh, Mr. Warbucks,
that's wonderful ne...
Um, when shall I tell
the judge to come?
Well, Grace, it's Christmas Eve.
Let's have the adoption tonight
and a big party as well.
- Tell Mrs. Pugh to order in
flowers, champagne, caviar.
- And ice cream and roasted corn.
Did you hear the little lady?
Ice cream and roasted corn...
and all the Christmas decorations
left in the city of New York.
- Yes, sir.
- And Grace, extend our invitation
to everyone in the house.
Miss Grace,
will you be there too?
'Cause it's really nice
when you're both together.
Grace, will you join us?
Well, I'd be honored.
Wonderful.
Let's get ready.
L-I'll take care of everything!
Mr. Warbucks,
the house is ready.
it's never looked better.
You've  outdone
yourself this time.
Annie!
Are you ready?
Leapin' lizards!
Just look at this joint!
- You know what, Annie?
- What?
I think I'm the luckiest man
in the world.
And I think
I'm the luckiest kid.
#Together at last #
#Together forever #
#We're tying a knot #
#They never can sever #
# I don't need sunshine now
to turn my skies to blue #
# I don't need anything
but you #
#You've wrapped me around #
#That cute little finger #
#You've made life a song #
#You made me the singer #
#And what's that

# Ba, ba, boom #
# Ba, ba, ba anything

#Yesterday
was plain awful #

again #

- # I don't need anything #

#Anything #
# I don't need anything #
# But you ##
- Grace!
- Yes, sir.
The house is all spiffed up.
Looks like we're ready.
That's a very pretty dress
you're wearing,
and you look
very pretty in it.
Thank you
for noticing, sir.
J
So happy you could make it
on such short notice.
Happy to be here to preside
over this momentous occasion.
- And this is Annie.
- Oh, how nice to meet you.
Well, Oliver, Annie,
I'm ready to begin if you are.
- I'm ready, Judge.
- Me too.
-
- I guess it's unanimous.
- Shall we begin?
Sir, before you start...
- There she is.
-
- Who are you?
- We're your mommy and daddy.
-
- Mind your manners.
We're Ralph
and Shirley Mudge.
- Ain't she cute, Ralphie?
- Oh, she's a regular doll.
Annie ?
-
- Sandy! Shh! Be polite.
Drake, please.
Perhaps we should
discuss this privately.
- Well, we was kids and poor, sick...
- And dumb to leave you.
But we had no choice.
You see, a nice man in Canada
offered us a job on a farm.
- No babies allowed.
- No.
So, we had to leave ya
for a little while.
Eleven years is more
than a little while.
Mr. And Mrs. Mudge, yours is
a touching story, but...
But l-l-I suppose
you'd like to see some I.D.
and, um, Annie's
birth certificate.
- That's my birthday.
- Those are the dates in Annie's note.
Yes, but I'm still not sure.
Finally, we saved up enough money
to come looking for our little girl.
And the very nice...
and very attractive...
lady at the orphanage said
we'd find Annie here.
- I still can't believe
we found our baby.
- Me neither.
Mr. And Mrs. Mudge,
there is one more thing.
Oh! You know, with all the thievin'
that goes on in orphanages,
I bet you don't have what
we left with you all those years ago.
You wouldn't happen to have
the other half of this?
Would you?
-
- The locket.
Perfect fit, so if you just get
Annie's things, we'll be on our way.
Mr. Mudge.
- What about the money?
- Oh, of course.
You'll be wanting something
for having taken care of her.
but... here.
You didn't know that Mr. Warbucks
was offering a $50,000 reward...
- He is?
Well, we sure don't want
no money.
- No, no, no, no.
- J
Come on, Pa.
On the other hand,
with $50,000,
we could afford
to bring Annie up right.
- Uh-huh.
-  In what form
might this money be?
Certified check.
You can pick it up
tomorrow with Annie.
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?
C
If that suits you?
Oh, yes, please.
We've lived without her
for 11 years.
I guess one more night
won't hurt.
Come, Shirley.
Wait, I just want one more look
at my sweet angel!
Come on. Let's join
the rest of the guests,
tell them
your wonderful news.
Everyone, Annie has
finally found her parents.
- Here's to Annie Mudge.
-  To Annie Mudge.
# Silly to cry
Nothing to fear #
# Betcha where they live's
as nice as right here #
# Betcha your life
is gonna be swell #
# Lookin' at them #
# It's easy to tell #
#The sun'll come out
tomorrow #
# Bet your bottom dollar
that tomorrow #
#There'll be sun #
#Just thinkin' about
tomorrow #
# Clears away the cobwebs
and the sorrow #
#Till there's none #
#When you're stuck
with a day #
#That's grey and lonely #
#You just stick out your chin
and grin #
#And say #
#The sun'll come out
tomorrow #
# So you gotta hang on
till tomorrow #
# Come what may #
#Tomorrow, tomorrow #
# I love ya tomorrow #
#You're only a day #
#Away ##
Aw, come on, why can't I
go with youse guys?
'Cause you can't leave children
all alone, that's why.
Huh! Since when did you care
about those little tykes?
It's Christmas. My heart is full
of glad tidings of great joy.
- Now let's go get that raggedy Annie.
- Catch you later, baby doll.
But l-l-I ain't the motherly type.
- Merry Christmas, Annie.
- Merry Christmas, Annie.
Did you look under the tree to see
if Santa left you anything?
No, he brought me my parents.
That's plenty.
Think they'll let me
keep Sandy...
and let me come visit you,
sir, and Miss Grace?
Yes, of course,
they will.
You look like
you didn't get any sleep.
Oh, yes, well, we've been
talking with the president...
and working with the F.B.I.
All through the night,
and they haven't turned up
anything suspicious, so...
So I'm really a Mudge...
Annie Mudge.
Where's our little
Christmas present?
- We know she's here somewhere.
- Mr. And Mrs. Mudge.
-
-
You will let me keep him,
won't you?
- Why, of course.
-
The only thing I love more than
little girls is little dogs.
Don't I, Ralphie?
Come on, Sandy.
Well, we better be on our way
with our little Annie.
- And our little check.
- So soon? Annie hasn't even
opened her presents yet.
- Sorry, we ain't got time.
- Very well.
If you'll come this way,
we'll prepare the check.
- Darn. Lost again.
-
Gosh! You sure you girls
never played poker before?
Beginner's luck.
How much she owe us?
$479.39.
What? Where am I gonna get
that kind of loot?
Hey, why am I worryin'?
I'll be rollin' in it when Rooster
and Hannigan get back from Warbucks'.
- That's where Annie is.
- Oops.
What's goin' on?
Spill the beans.
Nuh-uh.
My lipstick is sealed.
Yeah, but your purse ain't.
Hey, give that back
right now!
Yeah, I'm sure the cops'll
be very interested in your fake I.D.s.
You watch it. Get out of my way.
I want those back right now.
Fess up!
Okay, okay!
Rooster and Hannigan are pretending...
to be Annie's parents
for the reward money.
And when they get back,
I'll be sittin' large
and livin' pretty.
What makes you so sure
they'll be comin' back?
Because I'm Rooster's dame.
He'd never let me take the rap
and spend three months on Rikers Island.
Again.
Sir, the Mudges'
certified check for $50,000.
- Well, nice meeting you all.
- We'd better get.
Cheerio. Toodle-oo. Ta-ta.
See you in church.
- Aren't you forgetting something?
Oh! How silly of us.
We've been childless for so long,
it's gonna take some getting used to.
- Come on, precious. So sweet.
- Come, Annie.
-  Come on.
- Unhand me!
- You messed with the wrong dame!
- What are you doin' here?
Makin' sure I get my piece of the cake.
I want my moolah.
Out of my way!
-
We love you, Miss Hannigan!
- Run for it, Aggie!
Who do you think you are,
the president?
-
- Geez, Aggie, it is.
Well, if it isn't
the Mudges.
Or should I say,
Miss Agatha Hannigan...
and Daniel Francis Hannigan,
also known as
"Rooster" Hannigan,
Also known as,
"The jig is up, Rooster."
also known as
"Phyllis the Filcher."
Also known as,
"You loused up big, Lily."
Well, it ain't Easy Street,
but at least I'm wearin' silver.
Don't that hotel of yours
ever shut its doors?
Uh, it was his idea.
He made me do it.
Annie, Annie, tell these people
how good I always been to ya, huh?
Miss Hannigan, I would, but
the one thing you always taught me was:
Never tell a lie.
Brat! I'll let you in
on a little secret.
I never liked you. Never. You're
nothing but a rotten gold digger.
I've always been so good to ya,
and this is what I get, huh?
You drove me to this!
# I'm headed straight
for the nuthouse #
#With all the nuts
and the squirrels #
#There I'll stay tucked away
till the prohibition of #
# Little #
# Girls ##
Miss Hannigan's gone forever!
Annie, I also have
some important news for you.
Oliver.
The F.B.I. Were finally able to trace
the handwriting on that note of yours...
to a David and Margaret Bennett.
You mean the Bennetts
are my real parents? Where are they?
Annie, I'm sorry, it seems
they passed away some time ago.
So, I really  an orphan.
Annie, are you
all right?
Yeah.
I think so.
See, I always knew
my parents loved me,
and they'd come back for me,
if they were alive.
I guess you have to look
at the bright side.
At least I'm not a Mudge.
I hope this is the start
of a wonderful new life for all of us.
will be adopted
by a fine, upstanding family.
And Annie picked out Christmas presents
for all of you.
- They're waiting
underneath the Christmas tree.
-
Grace! When I talk about
a new life for all of us...
I do mean all of us.
And if you'd still like
to be Annie Bennett Warbucks...
I'd like that
more than anything.
I love you very much, Annie.
And I love you,
Daddy Warbucks.
