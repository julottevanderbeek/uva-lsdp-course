Yes, I wiII just because you say so.
My son is so innocent.
But mother.
- What?
Our Manju, she shouId
get married first.
I was about to say the same thing.
The engagement has been decided,
but they are from another viIIage.
Go some day and fix the date.
Why some day, I wiII send the
news there today itseIf.
Yes, you wiII want to hurry
up everything now?
Why? Why?
- Why?
Greetings uncIe.
- Come on, are you fine.
I have come to ask
about your heaIth.
I am absoIuteIy fine.
I am trying to make my ends
meet in this oId age.
It seems Iike the miII
workers are in troubIe.
Don't ask. These are
very troubIed times.
Since these machines have arrived,
peopIe's homes have been ruined.
Son, but you stiII feeI hungry.
What shaII we do to our wife
and chiIdren? StrangIe them.
PeopIe are thinking of
Ieaving the viIIage.
That's a very terribIe thing uncIe.
But what can be done, son.
No, this cannot happen.
It cannot happen.
So you drive a horse carriage?
My father used to do this too.
There are onIy two castes
in our viIIage..
..the workshop workers and
the horse carriage drivers.
And since your arrivaI the workshop
workers have become jobIess.
But what do you care about
the workshop workers.
What do I care?
If try to understand,
it is very deep.
It is one viIIage, and everyone
Ioves each other.
And when there is a
probIem amongst us..
..then everyone tries to
find a soIution for it.
Fine, but why don't they
Iook for some other work?
What other work wiII they do sir?
There isn't it farming
in this viIIage.
Yes, but they can go
in the city and work.
You want to send the residents
here to the foreign Iand.
No one wants to I eave their pIace.
But I have Ieft the city too
and come here for work.
You have come to expand
your justice..
..and you are sending these poor
peopIe out to beg, is this justice?
Sir, I have aIways heard that rich
peopIe aIways buiId viIIages..
..do you want to demoIish this one?
Look, I don't argue
much with peopIe.
Now much more work is done in the
workshop, we earn much more..
..I had instaIIed the machines
for that purpose.
Can't you find a way so
that you benefit too..
..and the poor peopIe
meet their basic needs.
Do you smoke cigar?
- What?
We poor peopIe are not
worthy of it sir.
Rich peopIe Iike you
drink up everything.
If you want, then you
drink up our bIood too.
You have come to argue with me!
The rich and poor can
never quarreI sir!
The quarreI is between the
hands and the machines.
You are Ieaving this viIIage
in this oId age.
Yes, or eIse we wiII have
to Ieave this worId.
Okay.
Bye.
No aunt, you must have
heard it wrong.
Why wiII I Iie?
I toId you what I heard.
But aunt we have some respected too.
After aII we are the bride's famiIy.
The issue wiII spread quickIy.
Who aII wiII I answer?
What is the matter mother,
what happened?
What can happen, you didn't taIk to
the grooms famiIy for so Iong..
..now they are fixing the
marriage with someone eIse.
What, they are fixing
it with someone eIse.
Yes, ask aunt.
But they had come to ask
for her hand themseIves.
When they had fixed it themseIves,
then what's the matter.
That's what I am saying, what
wiII happen to my daughter now?
How wiII I face anyone now?
Do heII with them, is this a joke?
I wiII not Iet that happen.
Come on aunt, come with me.
You don't worry mother,
come on aunt.
I had understood that your
intentions have gone bad!
Then you can think that.
It is very cIear, the brides famiIy
is giving me 2000 rupees..
..you give me, and the proposaI
wiII stay in your house.
This is business.
I wiII not Iet that happen,
understand.
I wiII not Iet you pIay with
my respect for money!
Then wiII you bring your
sister at my threshoId.
Quiet! I wiII kiII you
if you say that again!
Just Iike you had fixed the
marriage in front of everyone..
..you wiII have to break
it, understood!
Come on get up!
Come on! Come, come.
Let me see, what can they do to me?
You dare taIk so much.
Come on, Iet us see.
Come on, who are afraid
of the viIIage heads.
They are the protectors,
what is so great.
Say it in front of everyone!
Say it in front of everyone that
it is not my sister's fauIt..
..and you are breaking
the reIation for money!
So what if I am breaking it fro
money, who are you to stop me?
This doesn't happen in our viIIage.
Why not, he is my son I can get
him married wherever I want.
It is a sin to break the reIation
after binding it!
And it defames the
viIIage too Ganpat!
I don't care about
the entire viIIage.
Look, this proposaI wiII
stay in Shankar's house..
..or eIse we wiII throw
you out of the viIIage.
Yes, that's right!
Okay brothers, if that's
your advice..
..then I wiII keep the proposaI
in Shankar's house.
Who wiII send their sister in
a scoundreI's house Iike you!
Good that you showed your true
face before the marriage!
I am breaking the reIation myseIf.
But remember, you have ignored
her for weaIth..
..you wiII suffer aII your Iife!
What happened?
Nothing mother.
They turned out to be crooks.
I broke the engagement myseIf.
You broke the engagement.
- Yes.
What did you do, the
girI wiII be defamed.
She wiII not be defamed,
don't taIk nonsense.
What wiII happen now?
What wiII we do now? We have to
get Manju married, isn't it?
Then wiII we keep her
unmarried in the house?
I wiII get her married,
why are worried.
Who wiII you get her married too?
Look, my friend Kishna. I wiII
get her married to him.
Kishna.
- Yes.
I didn't even think about it.
- See.
Kishna is one our own.
- That he is.
But who wiII taIk to him?
I wiII taIk to him, why
are you worried I wiII.
You wiII.
- Yes.
Kishna.. oh Kishna..
- Oh Shankar..
Come, come, come.
You have come at the right moment.
Come sit, have something.
- No, I wiII drink water.
First have something.
Look, such deIicious vegetabIe.
- Give me.
I waited for you in the morning,
but you didn't come.
I had gone to the other viIIage.
- Okay.
I have broken Manu's engagement.
You have broken her engagement.
You did a very nice thing.
- A nice thing?
It was a different viIIage..
..she wiII find someone
better in our viIIage.
Take my advice, get married.
Marriage, you just said
what I was about to.
But there is one thing, both of
us shouId get married together.
Then I wiII get married too.
If you say, then I wiII
fix the marriage today.
But ask her first.
Whom do I have to ask?
I have to do everything,
whom shouId I ask.
That's fine, but someone
shouId taIk to aunt too.
My mother has taIked to aunt,
you teII me your wiII.
I feeI a bit shy whiIe saying it.
You are feeIing shy.
Hey you..
I am a Ioudmouth, but when
Rajni is concerned..
Rajni.
- Yes.
How wiII she suite me?
Why are you quiet?
Yes, teII me.
Where are you going?
You didn't taIk about
your marriage..
..then how wiII we get
married together?
We cannot get married together now?
What happened?
You wiII not be abIe
to hear it Kishna.
Look, you are under
my oath, teII me!
Don't give me your oath.
Look, you are under the oath
of out friendship, teII me.
Okay, then Iisten.
Even I wanted to marry her.
You too.
- Yes.
Don't joke with me.
Joke.
Fate has pIayed a joke on us friend.
Are you teIIing the truth?
- Yes it is true.
But how is that possibIe?
Yes, how can it be possibIe?
We both are one, but she can
beIong onIy to one of us.
This is a very big probIem.
I wiII soIve the probIem.
You get married to Rajni..
- Kishna..
Look, you are taIking
indifferentIy..
..there shouId not be difference
in our friendship, friend.
How did Iove come
between friendship?
Have you thought of anything?
What can I think of, you
thing of something.
I can see onIy one soIution.
You marry her, I wiII
move out of your way.
No, I don't want to come
between your Iove!
Then how wiII we decide!
Krishna.
- Yes.
Let us do one thing.
- TeII me.
Let us Ieave the decision of
our fates on God. - On God!
Yes.
- How is that?
Tomorrow is the veneration
in the viIIage tempIe.
The entire viIIage wiII go to
offer fIowers. - She wiII.
Rajni wiII go too.
If Rajni offers the white fIowers,
then she is yours.
What?
Look, Rajni wiII go to
the tempIe tomorrow.
if she offers the white fIowers,
then she is yours..
..and if she offers the yeIIow
fIowers then she is mine.
Why? - You have aIready
pIanned your victory.
You know that the yeIIow fIowers
are aIways offered in the tempIe.
Then you take the yeIIow fIowers..
..and she offers the white fIowers,
then she is mine.
Remember, if she offers
the white fIowers..
..then she is yours. - And if
she offers the yeIIow fIowers..
..then she is yours.
Fine.
- Yes.
Do you agree?
- I agree.
Then shake hands.
Come if you have too.
There are no turns in the path.
There is deIay but not deniaI.
Come if you have too.
There are no turns in the path.
There is deIay but not deniaI.

When you can't soIve your probIems.
When you can't soIve your probIems.
Have faith in Lord's justice.

The Lord wiII do..
Come if you have too.
There are no turns in the path.

There is no need to say anything,

Kishna!
Kishna!
What is this, Iisten to me!
WiII teII me something,
what is the matter?
ScoundreI, you deceived me!
You betrayed your friend!
I betrayed.
Not just that, You showed
your true face!
You showed me what
a Iow Iife you are!
Such taIks don't suit you.
This didn't but she did, isn't it?
You made your sister
exchange the fIowers!
Move, deceiver.
If you want to change
the topic, then do it.
But don't say such things.
I swear on our friendship..
- You betrayed our friendship!
And that too for a girI!
Mind your tongue. That's enough now!
Why shouId I mind my tongue
for a scoundreI?
Go away from here.
I might raise my hand,
get out of here!
You wiII raise your hand!
Are you angry with me?
- No.
You don't even taIk to me.
You aIways Iook away
whenever I come.
What can I say?
If someone eIse wouId have done it..
..then I wouIdn't have minded.
When you do it, it
doesn't feeI right.
I feeI very hurt.
I feeI as if I am of no importance.
Because of you, I Iost my friend.
I am not at fauIt for it.
If I had known that this
wouId have resuIted..
..then I wouIdn't have
even Iooked at you.
Don't make me feeI any more ashamed.
I am the one who is feeIing
ashamed, what did you Iose?
It was my mistake that I
feII in Iove with you.
Anyway, I cannot go back
from where I am now.
But I wiII not stop you, you can go.
A woman couId never understand
a man's friendship.
I don't even want to,
I know my worth now.
That's enough.
Why have you come here?
I have come to say something.
I don't want to hear anything,
go away!
But there is no harm in
Iistening to what I say.
There is no harm in Iistening,
but the intentions are bad!
He is dead for aII of you.
For God's sake don't say that,
may I die first.
Quiet!
You know very weII to
twist the matter..
..and your brother knows
how to ruin everything..
..but you cannot harm me!
I don't care for anyone, understood.
But pIease Iisten to me.
I don't even want
to see your faces..
..don't you dare step
foot on this threshoId!
WiII you go or not?
I am going.
Wait! - I was saying that, you
didn't understand anything..
Here, the symboI of
friendship and Iove!
Everything your brother
ate is in this?
Take it aIong!
And teII him, tiII now
you saw my friendship..
..and now you wiII see my enmity!
You seem to be a sensibIe man.
It can be very beneficiaI.
Then you think about the benefit..
..and I wiII think about the Iosses.
Take this..
I didn't give you this
idea for money, sir.
Traverse an hours journey
in 10 minutes.
One rupee, one rupee.
Where did this aeropIane come from?
Motorcar.
Come quickIy.
Chaudhary, what is this going on.
I say, who has brought
this bus here?
Who eIse can it be other
than the young master?
He seems to be a crook.
You don't know, he wants
us to become jobIess!
We wiII set his bus on fire.
- Yes, we wiII!
Listen, if you don't Iisten to me..
..then I wiII burn his bus
and workshop down to ashes.
Come, today we wiII come
to a decision! - Yes!
Go and caII your master.
- Yes, caII him.
Why, what is the matter?
Sir, have you brought this bus?
- Why?
Do you want us to die of starvation?
Do you want us to
Ieave this viIIage?
Do you want to make us jobIess?
Thinking that we are weak,
you want to progress..
..at the price of our jobs?
No, you are getting me wrong.
I want to progress
the entire viIIage.
Think, understand it is
the era of progress..
..machines and motorcars are being
used aII over the worId..
..and it is for the betterment
of our country.
Whatever is happening in the
country, it must be fine.
But this viIIage is in that country
to, think about it too!
But whatever I am doing..
..it is for the betterment
of the viIIage.
You are thinking about the
viIIages betterment.
As you instaIIed the machines,
the workers became jobIess.
They had to Ieave
on a empty stomach.
And now you have brought motorcars..
..so that we carriage
drivers Ieave too!
The probIem is that you don't
understand anything.
When the food and income
of a man is snatched..
..then he doesn't understand
anything!
Our carriages wiII not
affect you in anyway..
..but your bus wiII affect us a Iot.
I have not brought the buses
for your detriment.
I have brought it for the
comfort of the viIIagers.
The poor things come from far..
..they face a Iot of troubIe
in traveIIing.
With the bus they wiII
traveI comfortabIy..
,,and they wiII reach sooner.
Yes, we agree that they
wiII save their time.
But many peopIe wiII
become jobIess..
..you don't care about that.
The progress of the country
wiII not stop for you.
We don't want the progress
to stop too.
We are saying if the country
is progressing..
..then heIp us progress too.
You want to compIeteIy
annihiIate us.
Then progress, who has stopped you.
PuII your carriages faster
then the buses..
..who has stopped you.
You are being stubborn sir.
No, no it is very cIear.
AII of you want me to remove
the buses. Isn't it?
Yes, we want that!
Then puII your carriages
faster then the buses.
Let us decide.
Shankar So, Iet us.
Your horse is ready too, shaII we?
TeII me.
Okay, I agree.
- What are you saying?
I am right.
You wiII puII the carriage
faster than the motorcar.
Move, a man has said yes.
The first one to reach
the tempIe wiII win.
No, no sir we don't
want to contest you.
We want you to take pity on us.
Young master, have pity on us poor.
Think about it.
I am very generous.
Your onIy reIigion is money!
But we are not keen for your mercy.
A man doesn't extend his hand
to beg but to chaIIenge!
Don't go back on your words.
You can spit on my face if I do.
But remember, if the carriage
reaches the tempIe first..
..then you wiII Ieave the viIIage
aIong with the buses..
..or eIse aII of us wiII Ieave.
- Accepted.
Think what you are saying,
have you gone mad!
I have thought about it!
So teII me, shouId we
hoId the race tomorrow.
You have taken time to ruin us..
..give us time to find
a soIution for it.
Then teII me, when shouId
we hoId the race?
Tomorrow, after a month,
do you want a year?
After 3 months.
- 3 months.
Yes, after 3 months.
Come on, shake hands.
Leave me! Leave me!
Okay.
Have you gone mad?
When a rich man's heart
deveIops bad intentions..
..then the poor man goes crazy.
But I wiII not Iet this
viIIage be ruined!
You have ruined the matter!
The young master was ready
to Iisten to us.
He wouId have taken pity on us.
Those whose intentions go bad,
they never take pity!
Now we wiII have to
Iive with courage..
..and not on someone's mercy.
And how wiII we deveIop courage.
WiII you instaII a machine
on the horse's Ieg?
No I wiII not instaII a machine,
but come with me.
Come.
- Come on.
Come.
Do you see this road?
This is the road that goes
to the tempIe. - Yes!
Now come with me.
- Come on.
This is the smaII road that
goes to the tempIe too.
And we aII know that this road is
Look, if we aII work
on this together..
..then in 3 months this
road wiII be ready.
How can it be ready, do
we have a machines?
Seems Iike he has gone mad.
He has gone crazy.
Look, because of one machine owner..
..the entire viIIage
has become jobIess.
And if we viIIagers unite, then
their machines wiII be of no use.
They wiII be defeated, and
we wiII Iive peacefuIIy.
Okay fine..
Make the road aIone.
We wiII not heIp you.
Come on brothers.
Look!
Listen to me.
I am taIking for our betterment,
I don't have anything to Iose.
When the road is ready
inform us, we wiII..
The viIIagers can Ieave you,
you can Ieave me..
..but I cannot Ieave you.
TeII me one thing.
What I am doing, is it wrong?
- Says who?
Everyone says that.
But I never said so.
You are with me.
You are, aren't you?
I was aIways.
Now I am not afraid.
I was aIone, that's
why I was scared.
Now that you are with me, I
can feeI a new energy in me.
Leave my hand.
Leave my hand!
What are you doing?
I have chaIIenged the entire worId,
stop me if anyone can!
Don't brag, do your work.
I am there with you too, work.
The motorcar has broken down.
CaII out to the passengers.
Come!
Traverse an hour's distance
in 10 minutes.
Come on, the bus is Ieaving.
Come on. OnIy in one rupee.
Come on.
Sir, Iisten to me.
Give me some Iess money,
it is earning time sir.
Why are you after me Iike a beggar?
Here, earning time.
Here, make your earning. Beggars.
We have become beggars now.
Yes, this is as good as begging.
Shankar is better off then us.
At Ieast he is opposing young master.
When we have to die of starvation,
then come on..
..Iet us heIp our him.
You are right.
It is better to die
a respectabIe death.
Come on.
- Come on.
We have arrived too!

- Greetings.
You used to say that they wiII
not be abIe to make the road..
..but I hear it is quite ready.
But it cannot be compIeted
young master.
A trench has come in
between the road..
..and no bridge can
be buiIt over it.
This is a very big probIem.
That's what I was thinking about.
BuiId a bridge over it, fiII it..
..with mud, everything
wiII be fine.
What are you saying, the
bridge wiII coIIapse.
Why are you afraid,
continue working..
..during the contest, you can
drive the carriage over us.
What is the matter?
Why have you stopped working?
Can't you see, there is a
trench bIocking the way..
..I am thinking what to do.
What is there to think about?
Lord Ram had made a bridge on
such a big ocean to Lanka..
..then this is a very smaII trench.
Take Ram's name and
fiII it with stones..
..the carriage wiII
easiIy pass through.
HaiI!
- Lord Ram.
It has come.
Today on Wednesday, the
bridge has been buiIt.
Accountant.
- I have written everything sir.
Shut up!
The bridge is ready!
Seems Iike I wiII have
to do something.
Let your ideas and horoscopes be!
I have wasted enough time
in your nonsense!
Now I wiII see it myseIf.
I wiII see how they
wiII make the road.
They wiII buiId the road.
The bridge has been buiIt, they
wiII compIete the road too.
How can they, untiI I am there.
Move you cannot do anything!
You don't know him.
I know him, I know his horse.
He has constructed the bridge..
..he wiII compIete the
road, he wiII win..
..and you wont be abIe to

The veIvety dress with the works.
She is so gorgeous Iooking.

Why did he go there aIone?
You returned.

When the time comes, the carriage

We wiII have a Iot of
fun. What happened?
I sometimes feeI, that the enemy
is keeping a watch on you.
You are taIking about Kishna.
He thinks that you

No matter what, he is my friend.
If he doesn't heIp me for this too,

This is a kind of viIIage reforming.
ViIIage reforming.
Yes grandfather, you

Did you see the photo?
It's nice, isn't it?
Your face Iooks a bit ugIy.
The city girI who must have seen
it must be dancing with joy.
Won't I break her Iegs.
You are jeaIous.
- No way.
You are jeaIous, you are jeaIous.
I wiII hit you.
Then hit me, I wiII be confirmed.
Here.
- It has been confirmed.
Look who has come!
It is nice that you are here.
As soon as I saw your
photo in the paper..
..I Ieft everything and came here.
Now we wiII not Ieave this viIIage.
Now we wiII Iive here and die here.
What a nice photo, the
coupIe Iook nice too.
Maharaj, take a Iook
at both of them.
I think, they have taken
this picture..
..on the occasion of the
bridge being bIasted.
Accountant you aIways
say the wrong thing.
It is for the occasion of the
compIetion of the bridge.
Why are you venting your
anger on the paper?
Accountant, it is aII
about the stars.
He tried a Iot, the bridge
did not break..
..but these two sureIy united.
You dare raise your
hand on a Brahmin.
I wiII kiII you!
- Krishna!
I don't Iike such behaviour at aII!
When you couIdn't do your work..
..you are venting your
anger on a weakIing.
Young master.
- Quiet!
I have seen you aII,
you are aII useIess!
Young master, why are
you doing injustice..
..you are evaIuating
everyone simiIarIy.
If I want, I can make the
entire universe tremor.
I understood, what
do you want to say?
You can find an antidote
for the snake bite..
..but not for the probIems
that I create.
Give me 5 rupees.
- 5 rupees.
Give me, aII your wishes wiII
be fuIfiIIed. - How is that?
Come with me.
Come quickIy! Look
what I have found!
Look Mother Goddess idoI!
Come quickIy!
Mother Goddess idoI!
Mother Goddess idoI. See this.
Mother Goddess idoI.
- Yes, Iook.
HaiI.
HaiI goddess. HaiI goddess.
What wiII happen now?
Now there is an obstruction
in making the road.
Who says there is an obstruction
in making the road?
Who says now work cannot
be done here? - I say it.
Don't you see,
this is a hoIy pIace!
And now no road can be
constructed here!
And if you stiII want to,
then do it over my dead body.
HaiI Mother Goddess.
Priest, move or eIse I wiII
bury you right here.
WonderfuI, many Gods and Goddess
as for sacrifice..
..and you wiII not find a
ready sacrifice Iike him.
It wiII pain you in the beginning..
..but them everything wiII be fine.
Sinner!
Mother, see the atrocity
being committed on me!
Be happy Maharaj, you are being
sacrificed for Goddess..
..you wiII go directIy to heaven.
What is going on here?
Heed to my request sir.
Look sir, Goddess
has appeared here..
..and these sinners are
making a road here.
There wiII be a tempIe
constructed here..
..or eIse I wiII give up my Iife.
That's what we were doing.
We were about to sacrifice you,
so that you attain saIvation.
Shut up!
HaiI Mother Goddess.
You are right priest, a tempIe
wiII be constructed here.
This is reIigious work,
don't deIay..
..take aII the money that you want.
Since when did you start
thinking about reIigion?
Don't waste our time.
Hey, what are you watching?
Start the work!
You want to occupy the tempIe
Iand and make your road..
..that wiII never happen.
Go and do your work, tempIes
are made to show the way..
..to peopIe and not to obstruct it.
Why are you yeIIing?
You want to make me keep quiet.
Hear this, the work wiII not stop.
When rich peopIe Iike cannot
think of any other way..
..then you fooI peopIe in
the name of reIigion!
Shut your mouth, or eIse
I wiII shoot you.
You can shoot, but this
man is made of steeI.
The buIIet wiII come and hit you.
Move back sir.
Sir, Iisten carefuIIy.
If you want then you can shed
bIood on this road too..
..but remember, I wiII not stop
making this road for Lord!
You shouIdn't say that.
- Why shouIdn't I?
It is a sin.
I don't care if it is a sin.
Let us Iook for another way.
Which other way uncIe?
Don't you see, there
is a Iake ahead..
..it wiII take years
to buiId a bridge.
Pick up your spades.
We cannot do it.
- What?
This is a hoIy pIace.
The idoI appeared in
front of our eyes.
Yes, fatso is right.
So, I said it you got angry.
Now find some other
route for your road.
You rascaI!
Young master!
Not just him, even if the
Lord comes to obstruct..
..the path of the poor, then
I wiII take care of him, move!
Move! -- Don't do that! - Leave him.
What has happened to him?
- Nothing
Why are you getting
so excited partner?
Look, this Iand is so nice,
we wiII buiId a road on that.
No sir, that Iand beIongs to GopaI..
..he is from the other viIIage
and we have enmities with him.
He wiII kiII us.
Don't worry grandfather,
I Iook Iike a weakIing..
..but today for my hero
I wiII risk my Iife.
Come aIong with me.
Come uncIe.
Come, Iook such a nice Iand
and a shortcut too.
You join that road untiI then
I wiII cIear the fence.
Who is it?
WonderfuI.
And you are?
With whose permission did
you destroy this fence?
The thing is friend..
- Do heII with your friend.
Get Iost from here.
WonderfuI.
Beware, if you dare
come step forward..
..then I wiII kiII aII
of you right here!
TeII me.
Look, peopIe who Iive in
the same house do fight..
..but if an outsider comes to Ioot
then they face him together.
HeIp us, the honour of the
viIIage Iies in your hand.
Even we are with you from today.
From today, those who wiII
try to tarnish the image..
..of our viIIage, I wiII kiII him!
BuiId the road from here.
Not just the Iand, even of
the sky comes amidst us..
..we wiII buiId the
road on that too.
WonderfuI.
The Goddess bIessed
us with her grace..
..and we saved another two miIes.
Come on Maharaj.
Young master, Iet me see your hands.
Your fate says that
you wiII go aIone.
From today my astroIogy wiII
work on this road too.
HaiI Shankar.
HaiI Shankar.
You Iearnt quickIy.
HaiI Shankar.
We grow grains from the earth.
And bring pearI from the ocean.
Everything in this worId
is because of us.
How Iong wiII hard work
be bounded by weaIth?
Reach out and fuIfiII your dreams.
Comrade, Iend a heIping hand.
HaiI Lord Shankar.
HaiI Lord Shankar.
The road is compIete.
And that too on time.
It is aII because of God's grace.
Just hope that Lord graces
us with his bIessings..
..in tomorrow's race.
- That's what we need.
But the sensibIe thing is that,
tonight we have to be aIert.
Everyone wiII guard the road.
You never know the enemy,
he is very cunning.
Nothing wiII happen now.
Who is it?
If you shout, I wiII kiII you!
Who is down there?
Who is down there, come out!
It is me.
- It is you, what happened?
I had just gone under the bridge,
everything is fine.
Okay, be aIert. Come on.
Go, now there is no danger.
I won't go. You caII
whoever you want to.
I wiII take care of everyone.
Your Iife is in danger.
So what do you care,
think about yourseIf.
You couId have done anything
but not this.
You have ruined months of hard work.
This is the question if
everyone's respect.
It is the question of the
viIIager's Iife, Kishna.
But this is the onIy answer I had.
No one ruins his own house.
No matter what, a
friend is a friend.
Friend, which friend?
What friendship?
Your brother betrayed our chiIdhood
friendship in the youth!
He went back on his words,
his feeIings changed.
No Kishna, no.
If he wouId have toId me cIearIy..
..then I wouId have sacrificed
my Iove for him!
He toId me to Ieave
the decision on God..
..and asked you to
change the fIowers.
The scoundreI.
Brother never asked me
to change the fIowers..
..I did it on my own.
Now you are giving reasons.
Why wouId you change the fIowers?
I didn't want you to marry Rajni.
- Why?
I wanted.. you to marry me.
I Ioved you since my chiIdhood.
I aIways Ioved you.
Whenever you came in front of me,
I feIt Iike teIIing you..
..my hearts desire,
I was about to speak.
But I don't know why, I
couIdn't say anything.
I couIdn't expIain you anything.
My heart cried but
I never shed tears.
I kept burning from inside.
What are you saying?
That I have been Iiving
because of you..
..and now I wiII die for you too.
There is nothing eIse Ieft
for me in this worId.
CompIete whatever is Ieft.
Destroy this bridge!
StrangIe your friend! Set
the entire viIIage on fire!
Burn it down to ashes!
- Enough.
I am so crazy, that I couIdn't
recognise your desire.
I broke our friendship,
and today this bridge.
I wiII go to him, I wiII go to him.
No. If the viIIagers found out,
then they wiII kiII you.
But what wiII happen now?
Tomorrow is the race
and this bridge.
TiII today the entire worId
has asked you for something..
..but I never asked
you for anything.
I don't want much, give this
poor man's carriage..
..the sheIter of Lord
Krishna's carriage.
It is the question of respect Lord..
..I have come to bow before you.
Let me raise my head high
in front of the rich!
I don't want anything eIse.
WonderfuI.
AII the peopIe that have
come from far and wide..
..top see this race, Iadies
and gentIemen, beware..
..you don't have to wait
any Ionger, get ready.
Shankar's carriage
and Kundan's bus..
..get ready for the race.
The one who reaches the tempIe
first, wiII be the hero.
The carriage wiII
take the new road..
..and the bus wiII
take the oId road.
AII the viewers, take care of
your things and beIongings.
Stop gasping and hoId your breath.
Take a Iook at this pistoI,
but don't worry.
Everything is reaI but
this pistoI is a fake.
As soon as I fire this,
the race wiII start.
Let the race begin.
Wait!
- WonderfuI.
There wiII be no race!
Who says there wiII be no race?
I say there wiII be no race.
Father.
I knew everything, how you
tried to ruin this viIIage.
You tried to push these poor
peopIe to starvation..
..using your weaIth.
- Father.
You want to progress
on their dead bodies.
But I didn't do any injustice
to them father.
Then entire worId is using
machines and motorcar..
..for their benefit.
- Keep quiet.
You are defaming success by
taking the name of machines.
Even our government didn't
aIIow machines..
..where handicraft can be affected.
Today everywhere they
are trying that..
..the sounds of the machine echoes..
..where the artists
are not disturbed.
You tried to do things
the wrong way.
Instead of making machines
their friends..
..you made it their enemy.
HaiI!
- Master!
The machine does it's work, and
the workers do their work..
..why didn't you find such a way?
PeopIe have progressed in
the worId and not machines!
Machines have never made humans.
Father, you are pampering
these workers.
Yes, I have been pampering them..
..that's why they kept
bowing in front of me.
But you provoked them
to contest against you!
You didn't do justice with them.
Whatever you get, it
is because of them.
And whatever you give them
it is for their hard work!
This is the division
between two friends.
The share between two brothers.
The workers are the
oarsmen of the worId.
If there are no oarsmen, then
the Iife becomes directionIess.
Today for your benefit, you are
contesting animaI against machine.
But no country needs a machines..
..that wiII make peopIe jobIess.
Set such motorcar on fire.
This race wiII not take pIace.
Father, this race wiII take pIace..
..it is the question of my prestige.
I say this race wiII not
take pIace. - Father!
Master, Iet sir fuIfiI his wish.
We poor peopIe don't to
thrive on anyone's mercy.
It is better that we die then
beg to anyone for mercy.
I am ready.
The race is about to begin.
Don't worry, everything
wiII be fine.
Go!
You don't worry, he
wiII pass through.
-07:15:-09,-1324 --> -07:15:-06,-991
The enemy has everything..
-07:16:-65,-1920 --> -07:16:-62,-1325
..Raja we don't, have courage.
-07:16:-61,-1449 --> -07:16:-60,-1391
Run!
-26:-351:-413,-2571 --> -26:-351:-412,-1580
PIease, aIong with the fIag.
-26:-351:-410,-2902 --> -26:-351:-409,-1911
Thank you. Ready.
-26:-351:-408,-2366 --> -26:-351:-407,-1842
-26:-350:-426,-2324 --> -26:-350:-425,-2266
Sister-in-Iaw.
-26:-350:-412,-2244 --> -26:-350:-410,-1844
I am teIIing you Kundan sir..
-26:-350:-409,-2774 --> -26:-350:-407,-1839
..get out of this viIIage aIong
with your motor car. - Yes!
-26:-350:-401,-2566 --> -26:-350:-399,-1836
We had shook hands whiIe
accepting the chaIIenge..
-26:-350:-398,-2763 --> -26:-350:-396,-2169
..Iet us shake hands after
the chaIIenge too.
-26:-350:-394,-2759 --> -26:-350:-392,-1824
You have come to show
off your victory. - No.
-26:-350:-391,-2556 --> -26:-350:-390,-2362
I want the betterment
of this viIIage.
-26:-350:-390,-2288 --> -26:-350:-388,-1820
This viIIage wiII be ruined,
remember that..
-26:-350:-387,-2752 --> -26:-350:-386,-1818
..the machines you are
ignoring right now..
-26:-350:-385,-2750 --> -26:-350:-384,-1816
..one day, they wiII return
with a powerfuI wave..
-26:-350:-383,-2748 --> -26:-350:-381,-2348
..and aII of you wiII
be crushed under it.
-26:-350:-381,-2079 --> -26:-350:-378,-1416
We poor peopIe don't have
compIaints against machines.
-26:-350:-376,-2675 --> -26:-350:-372,-2614
Our onIy demand is that
we meet our basic needs.
-26:-350:-371,-2269 --> -26:-350:-369,-1801
Find a way so that we can
stay and so can you..
-26:-349:-428,-2733 --> -26:-349:-425,-2332
..the motor cars and the machines
can stay aIong too.
-26:-349:-424,-2196 --> -26:-349:-420,-1793
You are a Iearned person,
if you wiII heIp us..
-26:-349:-419,-2724 --> -26:-349:-414,-2661
..then we wiII change the
fate of the entire country.
-26:-349:-414,-2586 --> -26:-349:-412,-2118
Look at their heart
and their courage.
-26:-349:-411,-2249 --> -26:-349:-410,-1725
They are the need of the hour.
-26:-349:-409,-2181 --> -26:-349:-408,-1589
They are the pace era.
-26:-349:-406,-2178 --> -26:-349:-403,-1310
If you want to progress,
then accept them.
-26:-349:-401,-2439 --> -26:-349:-399,-1777
Instead of contesting with
them for personaI gain..
-26:-349:-398,-2703 --> -26:-349:-396,-2303
..work aIong with them.
-26:-349:-395,-2700 --> -26:-349:-393,-1765
Then one day not just

-26:-349:-392,-2697 --> -26:-349:-391,-1763
..not just in this country,

-26:-349:-387,-2425 --> -26:-349:-383,-2091
On this note shake hands

-26:-349:-380,-2485 --> -26:-349:-377,-1617
Shake hands. Shake hands
