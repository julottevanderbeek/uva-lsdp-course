Good evening, madam, sir.
Doctor Freud.
Good evening. Hello, ladies.
- Hello, darling.
- I haven't seen you for ages.
Oh, sorry!
- Oh!
-
Merry...
...Christmas...
...dearest...
...Father.
Max, put it out!
Please don't tell on me, Mary.
Just look at her!
You've burned the whole dress.
And now you've made me lose my pen.
Ach, I am late again.
Hurry! Mary and Max will be waiting.
Ha!
Father, look at my fairy's new gown!
- Mm. Now, we can't wait any longer.
- What about Uncle Albert?
Your mother and I mustn't be late
this evening. Come on, Mary. Max?
Max?
I'm stuck in here. Help.
Max, what did I tell you?
Can't you listen to me
for once in your life? Come on, up.
Finally! A motorbike!
I've no idea.
All right? Almost ready.
-
- Your mother is on her way down.
Is Uncle Albert here?
Louise, we really need to get going.
- Do you have to, Mother?
- We went over this, Mary.
But it's Christmas,
and everyone should be together,
and Uncle Albert will be disappointed.
Not as disappointed as I am,
but I told you it's an honour to be
asked to sing at the Palace Ball.
- Yes, but...
- Imagine the guests I'll sing for.
Try and calm yourself, Louise.
I'd better go to
the little girls' room.
Such a beautiful city,
don't you think?
Don't feel pressured to answer.
It was a rhetorical question.
But you know, I have the strangest
feeling that we are being followed.
I'd better check.
Hm. We are not being followed.
Now I'm a little disappointed.
We've been waiting and waiting!
Ah, I'm sorry, my Max.
Merry Christmas! Ah!
Merry Christmas, you two.
Are you leaving already?
Is Christmas over? Did I miss it?
I asked you to be here at five.
I don't carry a watch.
It inspires conformity.
Don't keep the children up
with your fairy tales.
Speaking of fairy tales, will
Doctor Freud be at the festivities?
I certainly hope not.
What's the matter, sweetheart?
I wanted you to help me
make them stay.
But you weren't here.
Well, I doubt I could have done
any better than you.
But I'm very sorry.
I hope you will let me
make it up to you.
Whoa!
- Where d'you want it, boss?
- By the tree.
And don't call me "boss".
- Is it for us?
- Could be.
That's a crate load off my mind.
And don't talk to the children.
Yes, boss.
Oy.
Merry Christmas.
Eyes closed.
Voilà.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Ahhh.
Uncle, it's beautiful!
Ja, ja.
Each doll has his own story.
That dear fellow is named Gielgud.
In a faraway kingdom,
he escaped the circus
to join a prince's court.
- You're making that up.
- No, he told me so himself.
And never call him a monkey.
It makes him furious.
- Why? Because he's a chimpanzee?
- Exactly.
Max, go ahead, give it a twist.
Wow!
Ahhh!
Ha ha ha ha!
-  Who's the fat guy?
- Shh!
You'll hurt his feelings.
That's Tinker.
He's very sensitive about his weight.
Well, I'm sure he just needs
someone to play with.
Ja, that's his job. Sticks.
He's a most promising young drummer.
But he plays so loud sometimes,
he drives Tinker crazy.
Last one.
- Oh, thank you, Uncle!
- Oh, you're welcome.
All right, children, supper time!
Wait a moment, wait a moment.
I have something else to show you.
That means you too, Herr...
Professor.
Mary and Max, meet...
...the Nutcracker.
I call him NC for short.
But watch out. They say he is
the most wanted doll in town.
Who by?
I would tell you,
but then I would have to kill you.
Right. Party advance to the kitchen.
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right.
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
Not until you have tied up
all your loose ends, Mein Kapitän.
Goodness, what a fruitcake!
And I don't mean Frau Eva.
Are you coming, Mary?
I want my Nutcracker first.
Max! How dare you?!
Mary! Mary, let me see.
He broke him, look.
It's all right, darling.
It's not so bad.
Here it is.
He always breaks everything.
Fortunately, I always come prepared.
Mm.
It's just a stupid toy!
No, it's not!
Tell him, Uncle.
Come down here, Max.
Ma-a-ax?
Mary is right, Max.
What is just a toy for you
may be a real friend for someone else.
It just depends on your imagination.
In fact, I have a theory about it.
You have a theory about everything.
Ja. It's called "relativity".
Would you like to hear it?
Sounds hard.
Nein. The hardest thing in the world
to understand is income tax.
This... is a piece of strudel.
# If you're with someone tall
# Truly vast, unsurpassed,
built to last
# They will think you're small
# Never mind after all
# When you meet a petite,
short and sweet
# They will think you're tall
# Up is down
Take is give
# In is out
Whisper, shout
# There's no doubt
it's all relative
# Who's to say what
# Is or is not?
# Who writes your plot?
# You do
# Everything's relative
Everything's relative
Quite!
# Everything's relative
Everything's relative
- # Right! Every point of view is...
- View!
- # Simply up to you, it's...
- You!
- # How your dreams come true, it's...
- True!
- # As real as...
- Who?
# Why, you!
# This is that
these are those
# What is real
What's ideal
# What to feel?
No-one really knows
# Fantasy comes and goes
# Black is white

# So you might
Turn your highs to lows
# If you think positive
# Open mind
You will find
# Life is kind
It's all relative
- # Except...
- # Relative, all
- # What makes...
- # Relative, all
- # Us what...
- # Relative, all
# We are, that's love! #
Why don't you come live with us,
tuck me in every night?
I'm always with you, dear.
If I seem far away, just think of me
and I'll be close.
Now close your eyes.
And dream.
Will you tell us
the Nutcracker story?
Uncle?
Uncle?
I'm sorry about my brother.
Boys are like that.
No problem. I'm used to it.
Oh, careful!
I don't want to get broken again.
- You can talk.
- Of course I can talk.
I knew you weren't just a wooden toy.
All right. If you really want to see
something amazing,
put me up somewhere high in the room.
Like the top shelf of the bookcase.
Mary!
Oh, here we go.
Up, higher, higher. Up, up, higher.
Up! Higher!
Up. Whoa.
Now spread some pillows around.
Stand back!
Perfect. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa!
Timberrrr!
I can't believe it. You did it.
What do you mean?
I mean, I've been waiting
for someone who believed like you.
You're really special.
You could imagine
that I'm really alive!
That I can move and think
and act and...
I have to act.
And now!
I need a plan.
You know, you remind me of someone,
but I can't think of who.
Not you, too?
Someone very familiar, very famous.
- Yes. Napoleon. I hate this hat.
- So why don't you take it off?
Because this hat is carved
together with my head.
By the way, it's the first time
I've seen a Napoleon nutcracker.
Please don't call me Nutcracker.
I hate that name as well.
- Call me NC.
- What? MC?
No, NC.
N... C.
-  Mary!
-  Quick!
Are you all right?
What happened?
I was fast asleep, dreaming, and...
kerboom!
- Oh!
- My pillows, well...
Just... They exploded.
Exploding pillows? Wait a minute.
I thought I heard voices.
Spontaneous combustion.
That's the name for it.
Didn't it ever happen to you?
Yeah. When I was younger,
a boy moved to my town.
- And he was so handsome.
- Mm! Mm!
I thought
he was going to propose to me.
- Ohhh...
- Maybe you can tell me in the morning.
- What am I thinking? We'll tidy up...
- Good night.
...in the morning.
- See you in the morning.
Ohhh, good night.
- Good night.
-
OK.
Phew! She would have dropped dead
if she saw me.
And we don't want that.
And that's on a good night.
You're a pretty good liar.
I'm impressed.
Me? I never lie.
No? Then what was that
about exploding pillows?
I was merely
being economical with the truth,
and that's altogether different.
-
- They did explode!
-
- I just simply didn't say why.
That's it! I've got a plan.
I have to speak to my friends
in the doll's house.
- You mean they're alive?
- Of course! All dolls are alive.
So, what's the plan?
Oh, it needn't concern you.
Girls are no good at military strategy.
Where are you going?
- I told you. To the doll's house.
- Wait. I have to get dressed first.
- I don't have time!
- How ungrateful men can be.
Grrrrrr!
It's appalling, that's what it is.
I can't believe you're
a friend of Uncle Albert's.
OK, I'm sorry. You're right.
Get dressed, then.
Oh, wait a second.
You didn't see any rats
down there, did you?
Rats? In our house?
My father wouldn't stand for it.
Phew. You should see
what they can do to a chunk of wood.
You might find it a little changed.
Are you ready?
Yes, I'm ready.
I've never seen anything so big.
Where's the ceiling?
The roof?
Is this real?
If you believe in it, it's real.
Come on.
Did we get smaller
or did the room get bigger?
If you don't mind me saying,
that's a naive question.
Have you already forgotten
what Uncle Albert said?
"Everything is relative."
Come on! Let's go!
Every toy you hung on the tree
is now alive.
The gnomes, the soldiers.
Even the snowflakes!
Quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!
-
- Oh, my head!
Ooh, I'll have some chocolate.
Be quiet!
- Quiet!
-
Can't leave them alone for a minute.
Come on.
- Oof.
- Let's pull it together.
One... two... three.
Run!
- Just be quiet.
- You're all driving me crazy, man!
What is going on?!
The front of the house
has just disappeared.
- Come down here, you lot!
- This takes the biscuit.
Your behaviour is unbelievable!
What do you expect from people
living in such conditions?
There's no privacy,
it's two in the morning,
and there wasn't meant to be
any noise after 11 o'clock.
- Be quiet!
- I have to file a complaint.
This house hasn't been refurbished
for 30 years.
There's so much poussière... dust...
that I've developed an allergy.
- Tinker, one more word...!
-
- Gielgud...
- Your Highness, I have no excuse
for my terrible behaviour.
But, in my defence, I was getting
one of my migraines at the time,
and I was reduced to this.
And he's still drumming!
It looks, Your Highness,
as if you have a plan.
Yes, I do. What we need to do is...
I shall never speak again,
but I have to say one thing.
- What?!
- Uncle Albert kept this house
in his dusty attic for 30 years.
All of a sudden,
it's his most valuable possession.
I've rarely heard of anything
more cynical.
How dare you
criticise Uncle Albert like that?!
I like it.
Uncle Albert call me Sticks.
Maybe Your Highness should introduce
us to his charming companion?
What? Oh, sorry, yes. Allow me
to present our new owner, Mary.
Mary is Uncle Albert's niece.
This is Gielgud, Tinker, and Sticks.
- Hi.
- My closest friends.
- The pleasure is all mine.
- An honour.
Right. The plan is this.
We're going in to fight
against the Rat King.
- If he's coming, I'm certainly not.
- We're not gonna miss you, man.
Hold it!
No-one is going anywhere yet.
Sticks, go up the tree and see
if the Snow Fairy is up there.
Erm... No, I'll go myself.
Wait.
You're not going
up the Christmas tree without me?
You'll have more fun if you stay with us.
I'll teach you some drumming.
Oh, don't listen to him. He's
the least reliable person I know.
Hmph!
Your Highness, it would be
my pleasure to give you a lift.
I hope you have a head for heights.
I certainly don't.
Wow!
After you.
All aboard?
Your Highness!
Say hello to your godmother from me!
No problem!
Why do they call you "Your Highness"?
Oh, er, no real reason.
Just something they do.
The cherubim and seraphim!
I hung them myself.
Hi.
Your Royal Highness!
Merry Christmas to you!
-  Hey! Hey!
- Merry Christmas!
Mary, you're very pretty.
Why, thank you.
Mother.
I've been waiting for you.
What took you so long?
I had to deal with the others.
Everything is chaos down there.
What do you expect?
They haven't been wound up for years.
I want to thank your friend Mary here
for my wonderful new gown.
Perhaps it needs a little tuck here,
to have a better shape?
Let me see.
That's better.
You know,
you look exactly like my mother.
But I'm not.
- You're the Snow Fairy, aren't you?
- Who else would I be?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Shhhhh.
Don't be frightened.
- Aren't they beautiful?
- Oh, yes!
You can join the dance if you like.
But I can't fly.
How do you know
if you've never tried?
You can do it.
Get on with it! Go on!
Come on, Mary, follow us.
-
-
Oh, I can fly! I can fly!
Like I've always dreamt.
Snow's coming.
Ooh. Ladies!
That was wonderful!
Bye!
Oh! Oh, I can't believe I flew.
Well, you can do
something even more amazing.
Like what?
There is something
I want to tell you.
About NC.
He is not like the others.
That terrible creature, the Rat Queen,
cast him under a bad spell.
She's so awful, I can barely
bring myself to say her name.
Rat Queen.
But with you here, Mary, we might
just have a chance to defeat her.
# How do you face the world?
# Cucumber cool or more frantic?
# Do you take the view
# Things you say and do
# Never mean a bean
when the world is so gigantic?
# How do you see yourself?
# Tough as old boots or romantic?
# Is each day a new beginning?
# Have you got a fight worth winning?
# You can guess, yes and yes
For you're special and unique #
Do you believe anything is possible?
- Yes.
- Then take his hand.
# Don't look down
# Don't be afraid to touch a star
# No matter how far,
no matter how bright
# Your dreams will take flight
with beauty and power #
NC?
Is it happening?
You're a boy.
Not just a boy! A prince!
Wow. You did it.
You believed.
And you released him
from the Rat Queen's sorcery.
Now I can go to my city,
and people can see me.
Now I have a plan.
I'm going straight back
to my kingdom.
No, maybe I should wait.
You really are an ungrateful person.
The least you could do
is ask her for a dance.
# Feel the power flowing
# Keep the magic going
# Young and old are growing
# Through the power
known as love... #
It's the Prince, all right.
I'd recognise him anywhere.
So, he's alive.
And he's dancing with the blonde.
We gotta go tell the King.
Let's get outta here.
As for the music, it's terrible!
It's a long way up,
and we're going right to the top.
It's so beautiful.
See that cloud there?
It was my city...
before the Rat King took it from me.
His mother turned me
into a wooden nutcracker,
and then he released his army
into the city centre,
scaring all of my people,
on a beautiful spring day.
Well, hopefully,
she'll come round tomorrow.
Why is there a black cloud?
The Rat King
is frightened of the sun.
So he has to burn everything
in a smoke factory,
including all the children's toys,
just to keep that cloud going.
Bring the next case.
Move it!
Come on!
Something juicy, I hope.
We caught them trying to blow up
the Palace, Your Majesty.
Sabotage? In my kingdom?
Aren't you ashamed
of trying to harm your king?
I see no king.
I beg your pardon?
You can turn our Prince into wood,
and turn us into your slaves,
but you'll never be more
than a mangy, dirty rat to us.
Such a pity.
It's all so unnecessary.
As someone who abhors violence...
Here.
So hard-headed, you humans.
Aaaargh!
# They had their chance
# But humans just couldn't do it
# Ran the world so badly
# That they blew it
# Far too bright and breezy
# Far too free and easy
# Freedom makes me queasy
# Now's the rat time for their fall
# Two, three four!
# Welcome to a Stygian era
# Darkness wherein rodents
see much clearer
# Days eliminated
# Sunlight's overrated
# Discipline created
Rat-wing policies for all
# So humans, sunshine, light
We can't stand them
# Rattus rules
Quod erat demonstrandum
# Glorious and gloomy
# Destiny runs through me
# And the lights go out
# The lights go out
# The lights go out! #
Genius!
Yes, a masterpiece, huh?
Come, come, come.
You the man!
Way to go, boss!
Please, you are too kind.
And I'll let you in on
a little ratty secret,
my greasy, terrorist little friend.
Soon, only us Rats will be left,
and we'll have an empire
that will last...
a thousand years!
Oooh!
Sorry. Too long. Lousy brakes.
Ahh! My loyal Bat Rats. What news?
- Nothing special.
- No big deal.
What news? I haven't time for games.
Your favourite prince
is still alive, sir.
- I knew it.
- Grrr.
Oooh.
I'm... so scared
Maybe I should
run into a hole... and hide.
Take them to the smoke factory!
I knew it! I knew it!
The Prince is alive!
- Zip it, baldy. Move it.
- He's alive!
Ow!
-
- Get my wig, quick! Quick.
Any idiot can face a crisis.
Day-to-day living
that wears you down.
Oh, Mother!
- Mother!
- Oh, it's only you.
Mother.
You appear to be slipping, old gal.
Your spell on the Prince is broken.
He's alive.
Alive!
If the other humans find out,
my dreams will be shattered.
I see his stupid face laughing at me.
What am I going to do?
Turn up your hearing aid,
for crying out loud!
Do you want to ratify the world or not?
Come to Momma.
Closer.
Be a rat! I'll put a new
high-grade curse on that little runt,
and then maybe one of
your stupid soldiers can grab him!
You bit me! Oh, you bit me!
Get out!
Make it stick the next time,
will you?
I need to build up my strength.
A little rat juice.
Must be that meddling Snow Fairy.
Little cutesy bore!
Welcome to paradise.
Come on.
Over there.
You said the Rat King
was frightened of the sunlight.
Mm-hm.
So why don't you just
shut down the smoke factory?
That's it! Fantastic!
Maybe some girls
are good at military strategy.
Oh, this is good.
What's happening?!
The spell's back on.
How did they find out?
I'm coming. Hold on.
- Mary!
- What is it? Why aren't you in bed?
- I have to save him!
- What, Max?
No, not Max. NC.
- My tree.
- What on earth is going on here?
- Frau Eva? Frau Eva!
- Coming!
Did I oversleep?
Oh, you're safe, you're safe.
Would you care to explain this?
Erm... Well...
Well, sir, I saw the exploding pillows,
but this? Mary?
- Exploded?
- Pillows?
That was before. Listen, please.
I tried to tell you. The King of the Rats
is afraid of the Prince...
Rats?!
And the tree was chewed down
by his Rat Dogs.
Joseph, do something.
I'm going to faint.
Don't be ridiculous, Louise.
There are no rats in this house.
You're meant to be in charge.
But what with that brandy glow,
it's no wonder you see exploding pillows.
- What's going on?
- You, get in here!
- Ow!
- Look what you've done.
I didn't do anything!
He didn't do anything.
I told you, it was the Rats!
- I think I see one!
- Louise, please!
Max never left the nursery.
This I am sure of.
Let me go!
All right! Enough!
Everybody, get to bed.
Children.
Louise, come down from there.
Tomorrow, I want real answers,
young lady.
Hurry, back to bed, children.
Hurry.
So this tree was 200 feet tall and
reached all the way up to the stars?
I told you. The ceiling was gone.
The ornaments danced, you flew,
and then the tree came crashing down?
It must have been wonderful.
Louise, even Max doesn't believe her.
Do you, Max?
Not a word.
Perhaps you'd like to show us?
Make this room grow before our eyes.
I can't. I don't have the power.
Then maybe you'd like to explain
how this tree got sawed through?
Because they have steel teeth.
A bit of fun is one thing, Mary,
but quite blatantly lying is another.
Now...
give me that doll.
You can't have him.
Ever.
And I'm not lying. I never do.
Joseph, listen. Do you remember
what Doctor Freud told us
about child psychology and dreams?
Please, can I have one morning
without that quack
being dragged into everything?
Where are you going?
I don't want you to see me cry.
Nobody's listening.
Not even trying.
# They simply say
# Come what may
# I'm lying
# But on reflection
# I'm simply different
# One of a kind, I don't mind
# I'm happy here
# Here with my secrets
# Here with my passion
# Dreams become real
And I feel I'm wanted
# Here I am braver
# I won't surrender
# Safe in my world
# And it's all I need #
You know,
I have the strangest feeling
that something is wrong
at Mary's house.
I'd better check.
I didn't do anything! I swear!
Thank God you're here.
He won't admit to anything.
I want to talk to you.
Please help me.
Quiet!
Happy Christmas, Joseph.
- Is everything all right?
- Uncle, a quiet word in my study.
Of course.
Alone.
