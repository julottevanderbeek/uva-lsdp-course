Go, Vassilis!
Vassilis is out of gas!
Guys, what about my ball?
Have they taken it? Who has?
There!
Oh! Let me see...
- You mean, they really took it?
- Can't you see?
That's impossible!
Well, l want my ball!
You, pirate! l want my ball!
- But what are they saying?
- They are not giving it to us.
Unbelievable! What's the meaning
of this? l'll show them now!
Hey, pirate! Give me my ball,
or l'll call the police!
lf you find a policeman in
bathing suit, send him over!
We say jokes like this to make
ice when the fridge is broken!
lt seems to me that
your fridge is broken again!
To hell with you!
Well, he went looking for it!
Don't tell me he didn't!
Guys, what's going
to happen to my ball?
They are just kidding.
We know them.
- Lakis, Lela...
- Paul...
- Do they live here, in Poros?
- They've come for the weekend.
- How come l don't know them?
- You haven't been here too long.
You are right.
What about that... funny lad?
- The one who was kidding around.
- A friend of Lakis's probably.
l'm going to get my ball.
- She is going to make a fuss.
- Nobody can stop her now.
She is such a strange girl...
Hey, you on the yacht!
We have sent a torpedo against you!
We've seen it
and we are ready for it!
lt's no big deal for us!
This is going to be very funny.
Get me a newspaper at once.
Didn't she call me a pirate?
Now you'll see!
Get ready to sail off.
She is getting closer.
This is going to be so funny.
Our torpedo reached its target.
Let's wait for it to explode.
Where is that funny guy,
if you please?
This way, miss.
What's going on?
ls it Halloween already?
My beautiful lady, as you
correctly noticed right away...
this is a pirate ship.
Really? Don't tell me...
Yes, but don't worry. Your life
is not in any kind of danger.
Yours is, on the other hand.
l'm sorry, but l am inclined
to inform you...
that l shall hold you prisoner
until the ransom has been paid.
You, from the boat!
The girl is our prisoner!
You'll take her back only
if you give us 20 bottles of beer!
Mister Chief Pirate,
the ransom has been paid.
lt is only appropriate now
that you let her go.
There you are, miss...
l am setting you free.
l am not doing the same for you.
We'll see after this song.
Hurrah!
As you see, the situation is
reversed. l am the prisoner now.
And don't anyone pay for ransom
because l'll be very mad at him.
Go and tell them
that we are here.
- Guys, are you staying here?
- No, we're leaving on the yacht.
What about you?
Hey, mister! We are here.
- And who are you?
- The donkeys.
So, you are the donkeys?
And l thought...
Guys, sail off!
Which one was l riding?
They are all the same.
Miss, this is your donkey.
lf only my life
could always be like today...
when everything around us
is beautiful and peaceful...
and there is such a blue
and bright...
sky!
lf only time
could freeze right now...
so that this moment
could last forever...
not allowing for darkness
to ever cover us.
Go, my little donkey, go!
Go with the rest
of the donkeys...
My silly little donkey...
What is it, little donkey?
What do you want to run for?
Only the silly ones run.
Go wherever they want
to take you...
and let your horseshoes
sound on the ground...
let them sound...
and wherever you go...
if you want to live
a beautiful life...
never think like
a human being...
let it roll on quietly.
lf only my life
could always be like today...
when everything around us
is beautiful and peaceful...
and there is such a blue
and bright sky!
lf only time
could freeze right now...
so that this moment
could last forever... .
not allowing for darkness
to cover us!
And not allowing for darkness
to cover us!
lf only time
could freeze right now...
so that this moment
could last forever...
not allowing for darkness
to ever cover us!
Won't you put me down
to stand on my own feet?
- Thank you.
- For letting you stand?
For everything.
Hey, guys, listen up!
Those who are coming to Piraeus
on my yacht had better hurry.
- ls there some room for me?
- Sure.
- Aren't you coming with us?
- l am, if you want me...
The yacht is not mine, you know.
Girls, please step down.
We are going to hoist the sails.
- Do you mind?
- My pirate...
May l sit down?
lf you promise that you won't
try to steal anything from me.
What if l tell you that
l have fears for the opposite?
That you might steal from me.
Do you have anything worth
stealing? ls it valuable?
l don't know about that.
lt is of great value for me.
lf l ever stole something,
it should be very valuable.
l won't do with some plastic
balls, like some people...
not to mention any names...
- We are here.
- Nice things don't last long.
lf they did, they might not
be nice anymore.
ls this something you believe,
or just a way to argue with me?
None of the two.
lt is something l fear.
Because of a disappointment?
l've no complains from my life.
l have been lucky up to now...
To the right!
- Well?
- All right...
On Saturday.
At 5.
Under the clock.
Ready?
And you don't even know
her name?
- Alice.
- Just that?
- Just her first name: Alice.
- You don't know anything else?
Nothing. She was with some
kids that my friends knew.
l didn't even know
most of them.
lt's hard to find out.
lf l don't go today...
Didn't you speak to mister
Papavassiliou? What did he say?
lmpossible. Penalties
are meant to be imposed.
The Commander! No, sit down!
- ls the Commander still inside?
- l think so.
Wait for me. l am going
to ask them to let me see him.
Costas!
You are late!
- ls that clear?
- Yes, sir.
You can go now.
Come in.
- The cadet l told you about.
- Show him in.
Degleris!
Fourth-year cadet,
Constantinos Degleris.
All right.
What is it, Degleris?
Commander, l wouldn't dare
disturb you for such a matter.
l am doing it because
it is a family emergency.
l can only tell you this, sir.
lt might be completely lost.
What might be lost?
Everything, Commander.
The fact that l was grounded,
quite unjustly l might add...
Well, if it is possible...
With interest, if l have to.
l could go out today and stay
inside the next two weekends.
Or the next three.
What do you say, Commander?
Could this be possible?
No.
l said no! And no means no!
ls that clear?
Daddy, why do you treat me
like l'm some petty officer?
Did l ask you for something
that difficult?
Are you nuts? You're going to
the cinema at 5 in the afternoon?
Me and the girls agreed
to meet a little earlier...
to kid around, to have some
ice-cream... ls it so bad?
Do not say anything more
on the matter.
Your aunt and cousins are coming
and we are going out together.
What shall we say? That Alice
went to the movies at 5 p. m. ?
Never mind the movies. Can l
have an ice-cream and come back?
You are going nowhere!
ls that clear?
She is blonde and tanned,
like a well-baked bagel.
You'll see her under the clock.
Go to her bravely and say...
"On behalf of your pirate. "
She'll understand.
She will... And then,
you'll explain to her.
- What shall l explain to him?
- What do you think?
That l wasn't allowed to go out
and l'd like him to call me.
- During the hours l've written.
- And how shall l know him?
His name is Costas.
He is tall, with brown hair
and green eyes.
How shall l speak to a stranger?
What if it is not him?
Wait!
lt's the ball l told you about.
lf he sees it, he'll know it
and will approach you instead.
Go on, it's 10 past 4!
You are going to be late! Go!
- Miss Alice?
- Pardon?
On behalf of your pirate.
Your pirate...
Beware of the heat!
lt's bad for you!
- Nothing.
- What do you mean?
She probably didn't come.
Not to mention the embarrassment.
l saw a blonde, just like you
said and l walked towards her.
"Miss Alice?" l asked her.
She probably didn't understand.
"On behalf of your pirate",
l said to her.
And she said,
"The heat is bad for you. "
lmpossible. She is not like
the girls who don't show up.
- She must have come!
- Do you think l am crazy?
Are you sure there was no girl
under the clock?
- Under the clock?
- Wasn't there any girl?
- There was one.
- What did she look like?
No way!
She can't have been her!
lt was a girl with dark hair
holding a...
How do you call it...
A... plastic ball.
A ball, you say?
What kind of ball?
A plastic ball
for playing in the sea.
That was her!
Costas, she wasn't blonde.
She had dark hair.
Dark hair...
She must have dyed it.
Women are like that.
Dark hair today and fair
tomorrow. Go figure...
Costas, she was also plump.
- How plump do you mean?
- Quite plump.
She's gained weight. She grew
an appetite and got fatter.
Who are we to tell her
not to eat?
Costas, she was short too.
- Short? How short?
- Short enough.
Could it be that you stood on
the pavement and she did not?
No, Costas, l'm not stupid.
The girl was short.
- How short was she?
- Up to here.
- l'm confused now.
- Short...
She may have got fatter, but
how could she become shorter?
How could she?
Tell me again,
how short was she?
She was up to here, Costas.
- lmpossible.
- Why is it impossible?
To say that it was a short cadet
with long nose and black eyes...
of course it is impossible.
lf he had one black eye, l'd
say that they had blackened it.
But they were both black.
And then, you say he was short.
No more!
There it goes now,
there goes the dream, l think.
l know she doesn't love me
and l'll never find her again.
There it goes now,
but how can l say it to you?
Though she doesn't love me,
l love her even more!
Though she doesn't love me,
l love her even more!
This year's ball
is a great success, isn't it?
- Greater than the last year's.
- Here comes our Commander.
How are you?
Good evening.
Takis?
l've come especially for you,
to talk about the old times.
Who is the young lady? Don't
tell me it's your daughter.
- lt is. Mister Panagakis.
- Happy to meet you.
l was happy for you 20 years
ago, when you were born.
He is a good old friend.
The pasta we've cooked for him...
- l didn't see her last year.
- She was in Switzerland.
She studied there for 3 years.
She only came back a month ago.
Alice!
Come, it's Spiros.
How are you, Spiros?
Come now, sit down...
Go on, young lady. You'll
be bored with us the old men.
Who are you calling old?
Go on...
How are you?
She's a young lady...
So many years have passed...
Don't remind me.
Good evening.
ls Sophia here too?
Where is she?
- She's dancing over there.
- There she is.
Sophia!
Sophia...
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Excuse me for a moment.
Excuse me, Jenny.
My pirate...
And tonight you are really
something worth stealing.
What about that Saturday?
Don't "aha" me! You never
showed up, Mr. No-good Pirate.
Or was it the other way around?
Perhaps you never showed up.
- Why? Did you?
- Did you?
- l'm asking you. Did you go?
- And l'm asking you. Did you?
Let's say l didn't go.
Did you?
You know something? Shall we
talk about this while dancing?
Yes.
Good evening!
- Who is this?
- lt's Chronis.
Hello, Chronis.
- Are you wearing glasses?
- lt's some strange eye problem.
Strange things always happen
to me. lt's temporary though.
lt is very annoying, because
l cannot recognize other people.
And l said, "lt couldn't be
a short guy with a big nose. "
My pirate has a pretty nice
nose at least.
To give the devil his due now.
l went nuts when he told me
about the ball.
But then, dark haired, plump
and short? There was no way.
Who is that? The girl
dancing with Degleris.
What? Don't you know her? She's
your Commander's daughter.
What did you say?
Our Commander's daughter?
l must warn him. That she is
our Commander's daughter.
- Do you think he doesn't know?
- Would he dance like that?
The Commander is mad at him.
He mustn't see him like that.
l am sorry to interrupt.
Come with me for a moment.
Are you nuts? Why should l leave
the girl l nearly lost once?
Someone has asked for you.
You must go to the gate at once.
- Go, if it is an emergency.
- l'll be right back.
See you in a moment
on the stairs.
l hope you come this time.
Don't send any shorty
with a long nose again.
Let's go.
Wait, where are we going?
On a field trip?
- We are okay here.
- Don't they need me at the gate?
Forget about the gate. l must
tell you something important.
Why did we have to go
so far away?
Do you know who is the girl
you are dancing with like that?
- Of course l know.
- And you are not scared?
- Scared of what?
- Tell me, who is she?
The girl l'd meet at the clock.
lf she was just that girl,
it would be alright.
She is the Commander's daughter.
The one you were dancing with?
The cadet? Costas Degleris.
Do you know what happened
between me and Degleris?
lt was like an old man looking
for the glasses he's wearing.
- What are you looking for?
- My glasses.
You are wearing them.
Damn... l'm starting
to believe that l got old.
- Do what l'm telling you.
- What are you telling me?
- Disappear.
- Are you crazy?
You are the crazy one! Do you
want to waste your time?
He's already mad at you.
He went to the gate.
There he is...
Let me see who he is already!
Girls, he's coming for me.
Please, go away.
Well, here l am, Mr. Pirate.
Shall we continue our dance...
which we left unfinished,
like Schubert's symphony?
Of course we'll continue it.
- What about Degleris?
- l'll tell you.
Did you by any chance meet some
kind of a voice-taking witch?
- Why do you say that?
- You are not speaking at all.
What should l say?
You don't have anything
to tell me, do you?
Thank you very much.
Alice! Come here, my child.
Good night.
Good night.
Have a good night.
Glad to see you, child.
- What's going on?
- They are leaving.
Good night, Commander.
lt's been very nice tonight.
The music was good too.
Better and better every year.
Alice! Come here, child.
Come on now, we are leaving.
l am amazed at myself!
How could l be so rude!
Rude more than anything...
What will the girl think?
You'll explain to her some time.
lf you're still interested.
- You don't understand!
- What should l understand?
That this girl is...
That l am going nuts.
- Why would you go nuts?
- Because it's like that.
Think about it. You see me
out of a sudden, mister...
and you are acting like a man
who sees the sea after 10 years.
Had you been a dog, you'd be
wagging your tail like crazy.
You were so happy...
Then, all of sudden, you become
speechless and very cold.
Why? What have l done to you?
lf l've done you wrong, tell me
and l shall apologize to you.
lt's really a mystery.
Yes, but l don't care so much
about mysteries...
so, l'll try to figure it out
first thing tomorrow.
Extend, raise and stretch your
hands! One-two-three-four!
One-two-three-halt!
The same! Begin!
One-two-three-four!
l'm sorry,
but this is the procedure.
l understand.
Extending and stretching out
the hands along with clapping!
One-two-three-four!
One-two-three-four!
- Come in, miss.
- Thank you.
March forward!
Look over there!
- l told you to look over there!
- l did!
And you look over there now!
- Do you know where Degleris is?
- Around here, miss!
Alice!
Lazarus, come forward.
- Has she gone?
- She has.
Degleris, what are you doing?
Diving exercises, sir.
- l don't like this.
- But why, daddy?
- What did you come here for?
- To ask you...
Whether l'm letting you go to
the theatre with Liza tonight.
Why didn't you ask me before
l left home in the morning?
l forgot.
Why didn't you wait
to tell me at noon?
l was afraid l'd forget again.
Since l remembered it...
- Why didn't you phone me?
- l thought l'd take a walk.
Next time you want to tell me
something, you should call me.
And if you feel like taking
a walk, go somewhere else.
The Academy is not the
proper place for... walks.
- All right.
- All right, what?
You said something and l agree.
ls it so bad? Tell me if it is.
Alkis...
Alkis!
Alkis!
Pssst! Alkis!
l'm just beginning to realize
how much l love her.
And you chose to tell me
at this time of the night?
Couldn't it wait
till tomorrow morning?
- l can't sleep.
- l can though.
Does it feel right to let me
stay awake all by myself?
Sure it does. Should l lie awake
because you've fallen in love?
Takis...
Ha?
- You are not sleeping either.
- No, l can't sleep.
Thinking about your girl?
No, l've had too much melon.
Takis, do you know anything
about that training trip?
- When are we leaving?
- On Wednesday.
Good...
Next Wednesday?
- That's right.
- On the training ship?
Of course, what else?
- And are you all going?
- What do you mean by "all"?
The whole Academy?
The cadets too?
Especially the cadets. Those
trips are for their training.
Are all the cadets going?
Would you like us
to leave one behind?
To do what? Jesus...
Alice!
- Don't let them wait for you.
- And don't be late!
Hello!
Hi, how are you?
For your information,
your daughter is in love.
- And very much so.
- With whom?
l don't know about that.
l just know that she's in love.
And, if l may ask you, how have
you reached this conclusion?
- That Alice is in love.
- l've noticed.
You've noticed what?
The symptoms of this "illness"
are so typical...
Temper, loss of appetite,
staying in her bedroom...
crying with no reason...
- l know because l've had them.
- You've had those symptoms?
l have also been in love.
With you, silly.
Remember? You were a cadet.
You were about to sail off...
and watching the preparations
l said to myself...
"Virgin Mary! lf only l could
sneak inside the ship... "
Well, l'll sneak inside!
- How are you going to do it?
- l haven't figured it out yet.
But l'm sure
l'll think of something.
Left-right! Left-right!
Left-right!
Left-right!
More lively now!
The song says it. No medicines
or change of scenery may help.
No talking, Vranas!
Left-right! Left-right!
Have a safe trip
and call me.
- Where is Alice?
- At the car.
Are we ready? Good...
- Goodbye then.
- Have a safe trip.
- And listen to your mother.
- Yes, sir!
Do you understand? And hurry.
Mom!
Daddy left his suitcase!
- How did he forget about it?
- l don't know. lt was outside.
l put it into the car!
Perhaps the sailor took it out
to put something else inside.
- l put it in the car myself!
- That's what l'm saying, lrene!
You put it in the car and
the sailor took it outside...
and left it on the pavement.
- Wait, l'll call him.
- Who are you going to call?
Your father, to tell him
to send for it.
The car doesn't have a phone.
Where are you going to call him?
Daddy won't be there
for at least half an hour.
lf you call him in half
an hour and he sends a car...
they'd need an hour to come
here and go back again.
There are things that he needs
in the suitcase. How do you know?
l can imagine. lt's a suitcase,
so it has things that he needs.
Would he put a vase inside?
- l'll call at the Academy.
- l'll go, mommy.
What's the big deal?
l'm getting a cab.
Call and tell them to let me
go through just in case.
- We'd better send lrene.
- lrene can't handle this.
She'll get mixed up and go
to a different place.
lt's daddy's suitcase.
The Commander's, that is.
Leave it here.
l'll send it at once.
Can l take it to him?
l need to tell him something.
- You see, l am...
- Miss Alice!
Hello! How are you?
Of course l remember you.
Have you come
to see your father off?
He forgot his suitcase, but
they won't let me go through.
- Send it at once.
- No!
l'd like to board the ship
to tell him something important.
ls this so hard? Come now...
- Let her go through.
- Thank you!
Take the suitcase and lead the
young lady to the Commander.
- l know how to go there.
- This way, miss.
Do you know what l'm thinking
about? Where can she be now?
Can you do me a favour?
Take the suitcase to my father.
And don't tell him l'm here.
l want to surprise him.
- Yes, miss.
- Thank you.
Pull up the staircase!
Ready to sail off!
Both engines
reverse half speed.
The helm to the right!
- Play some music!
- l'm eating now!
Come on now, play!
Leave the bread!
- You are very good.
- Play the other song too.
No more now.
My bread! Where is my bread?
ls this why you told me
to play the harmonica?
Like the raven and the fox?
Give me the bread!
The raven is not so foolish,
like in the time Aesopus lived.
This is not your bread!
Let it go! lt's my bread!
- lt's mine!
- What happened to my bread?
How should l know?
This is mine, l swear!
Give me my bread!
- Are you gloomy again?
- Leave me alone.
Well, this is becoming
a joke now.
- Do you think it's funny?
- Not to say ridiculous.
- Unacceptable for a man like you.
- You don't know my problem.
What is your problem?
Let's talk over here.
Can you understand it?
lt has become like a nightmare.
l cannot concentrate,
or find any peace.
lt's like she is a ghost.
l can even hear her voice.
- Nonsense...
- l can hear her voice.
Mister Pirate...
Damn! l can hear her too!
- lmpossible!
- l am scared, Costas.
Alice!
Ghosts don't go out at noon
for sunbathing.
Don't look around. Just look
whether someone is coming.
Nobody is coming.
Good morning!
lt's a nice weather today.
Don't you think?
l've never seen a pirate
so confused in my life.
Someone's coming.
Stay where you are.
l feel numb.
l need to stretch my legs.
Please, Alice,
don't say crazy things.
- What is going to happen?
- l have an idea.
Don't you move it from here, miss.
l swear, you guys.
And for a moment...
What is it?
Those guys were talking and one
of them spoke like a woman.
ln the end, the tall guy
called the other one "Alice".
- Go to hell!
- l swear to you!
Come with me.
- ls everyone alerted?
- Yes, they are all coming.
- Hurry up!
- Why did you call for us?
- Are the doors closed?
- Yes!
ls everyone here?
Come with me.
We called you here for a very
serious and top secret matter.
We rely on your chivalry,
your discretion...
and the sense of solidarity
that exists among us.
Tell us!
Gentlemen, l'll say it
in just two words.
There is a mine aboard ship.
And l repeat, a live mine.
Live, completely live!
And blonde.
And to be more precise on the
matter, most of you guys...
know about the love drama our
friend Degleris is experiencing.
All of you remember, don't you?
Well, Degleris...
- Wait, let me speak now.
- Go ahead then.
About 3 months ago,
Degleris...
- 2 and a half months.
- About 2 and a half months ago...
Take out the cover of the boat
and fold it carefully...
Or rather leave it for now
and come with me.
- And at the first harbour...
- How shall we bring her here?
Gentlemen, there is a solution
to this problem also.
But we must find somebody
with almost the same height.
Papasotiriou, come here.
Costas!
What? Are we dancing now?
l need to check you out.
No. She was just up to here.
Come here, Nakos.
- This should be all right.
- Undress!
- What am l going to do?
- Pretend to be sick.
This daring operation must be
executed only by volunteers.
There must be 5 of us. Takis,
Costas and l will be the three.
We need 2 more. Those of you who
wish to come, raise your hand.
Thanks a lot, boys.
Guys, we are ready.
Here is the uniform.
Quiet, boys.
Take it easy.
Guys, we must leave quietly
not to raise any suspicions.
Some of you stand in some parts
of the route to cover us.
We can't leave all together.
Costas, leave with Takis.
Apostolou will go by himself
and then, Papadopoulos and l.
All right?
Let's go.
- Let's go with the help of God.
- Amen.
Let's go. Guys, as we agreed.
All right?
l drink water over and over
and l have a full belly.
The one called Alice by the
other one had a round belly.
- You are impossible!
- Why do you hit me, guys?
- Understood?
- Yes.
The clothes, boys.
When you are ready, tell us
and wait there.
- We'll tell you when to come out.
- Okay.
Apostolou, go over there
to check things out.
- l am ready.
- Wait for a moment.
- Hurry up, guys.
- Come on out.
Walk forward
like nothing is happening!
You are something else!
This is not acceptable.
Come in!
Bringing you a sample
of the food, sir.
Commander,
would you like to try it?
l left my glasses
at my cabin again.
- What's for today?
- Fish.
lf you were patient, the mystery
wouldn't be a mystery any more.
Why didn't you tell me to wait?
Why didn't you explain to me?
- l got confused that night.
- You should call, or write.
lt's all simple to you.
Guys!
l am sorry to interrupt, but
you can talk about it later.
There are more pressing
matters at hand here.
This situation is unprecedented
and if they find out about it...
not only must we all be expelled
but we should get hung too.
The young lady must disembark
at the next harbour.
- l will then.
- That's easier said than done.
This is not a bus, where
anyone can get on or off.
What if she goes ashore among
the others wearing the uniform?
This is the only way, but what
if the Commander is present?
The other officers might
not notice one more cadet... .
though l doubt it, but the
Commander is bound to know her.
That's right.
Let's take his glasses!
He can't see anything without them!
- That's it!
- The glasses is an idea.
- What's that?
- lt's the signal for dinner.
- Good. Let's eat.
- Are you crazy?
l'm hungry.
You can't possibly
come to the dining-room.
They won't know it's me
among so many men. Let's go.
l feel like putting on a life-
jacket and falling into the sea.
- Please, stay here.
- OK, but won't l have dinner?
- We'll bring you food.
- We'll bring you something to eat.
Bring me a lot of food.
- Are you sick?
- No, l'm fine.
- Then, why are you in bed?
- You are wearing my clothes.
These are yours?
Would you like to trade places?
What do you mean?
l could stay in bed and give
you the clothes to go and eat.
- Will you stay like that?
- l hope they'll remember me.
The army boots are so big.
First l make a step inside
the boots and then they move.
l'm telling you, our basketball
team will crash you.
- We are stronger.
- We'll see about that.
And it will be noon.
- They are late.
- Yes, they are.
lt seems that you eat well
at the Navy.
Costas, Takis, move!
Take it easy!
Come, Costas!
Guys!
Alla una, alla due, alla tre!
Hurrah!
Guys, don't shout so loudly,
because we are dead.
We could cheer in a lower
voice, like this: Hurrah...
Easy! The bottles go below!
Put the appetisers above!
We have one here too.
Take some of these too.
But, this is a proper dinner!
Of course it's a proper dinner.
lt's your engagement dinner.
Bravo!
Lower your voices,
or we are all going to prison.
lt's a triumph, gentlemen!
Daddy's glasses!
- How did you do it?
- l got lucky.
He'd left them on a table and
as soon as l got the chance...
Holy Christ... Where on earth
have l left them again?
- Steward...
- At your service.
ls that you, son?
Go to my cabin, please.
l've left my glasses there.
Go on...
Oh no... Oh no!
She's laughing too much
and l don't like it at all.
She's getting crazy when sober.
lmagine now that she's drunk.
Costas!
Come on, Alice, that's enough.
- l haven't drunk anything yet.
- The others want to drink too.
All right, take it.
Tell me, am l the superior
or are you?
- l'd say that l am.
- Not likely. l am.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. l'm thinking.
About my future.
What l'm going to do now that
l'll be kicked off the Navy.
l must do something to get by.
Shall we do a trio?
Guys! Sh!
lt was a wonderful dinner,
but it can't end in silence.
Dancing and singing
is in order.
lt's clear now.
We are finished.
- What did you say?
- Nothing...
We could do without the song,
or we could just say a psalm...
and then fall into the sea
one by one. What do you think?
You are right. lf we have time
to fall before they drop us.
We are going to sing!
We'll sing and dance, right?
This is a mystery, because l
remember they were on the table!
- Did you search the place?
- Yes, sir. They are not there.
We've looked everywhere.
Could l by any chance wear
them and haven't noticed?
Yes...
Move on and fear nothing.
We need to be brave in our life.
And hope always keeps us
good company.
You shouldn't burden your heart
with bitterness or sadness.
Move on and fear nothing!
Move on and have no worries!
Move on not thinking
about the future!
Move on and do
whatever you like!
Move on before
your youth goes away!
Move on,
our life is so short!
Move on and fear nothing, the
night is followed by the dawn...
and the world is just a sphere
rolling day and night.
Be sad about nothing...
Have no fears...
Move on and have no worries,
it's just a rolling sphere.
- Move on!
- Not thinking about the future!
- Move on!
- And do whatever you like!
- Move on!
- Before your youth goes away.
- Move on!
- Life is so short!
Move on and have no fears,
our life keeps changing.
And you never know
what's going to happen next!
Drink, sing and laugh,
do all kinds of crazy things.
Move on and have no fears,
move on and keep smiling.
- Move on!
- Not worrying about the future!
- Move on!
- And do whatever you like.
- Move on!
- Before your youth goes away!
- Move on!
- Our life is so short.
- Goodnight, gentlemen.
- What about you, Commander?
Since l can't read, l'll go
for a walk around the ship.
Have a good night.
A boat was all alone
on a blue sea...
and there was also a sea- gull
with white feathers.
And it kept flying around her
to tease her...
making its wings wet
in the blue water.
l felt jealous of the small
white boat...
because the sea-gull
was speaking to her sail!
And l feel like a little boat
in the blue sea...
always waiting
for the sea-gull to appear.
A red geranium blossomed
in the pot...
and a butterfly came
flying like crazy...
and who knows what the
little tease said to it...
forcing it to become
even more red!
l keep thinking about
its wide wings...
but l can't figure out
what they said to each other.
Whoever knows it
should also tell me...
l wish l could hear it from
you even though l blushed too.
Last night's moon made the
poplar's leaves look silver...
as it stood still
in the middle of nowhere.
At the first sea-breeze
it rustled...
and its silver leaves
quivered.
l keep thinking
and thinking that something...
must have been said by the
sea- breeze through its branches.
lf only l could hear from you
the sea- breeze's words...
even if my heart would quiver
like the leaves.
- What are you doing here?
- Just talking, sir.
Get out of here! Go!
Bravo!
What is going on, gentlemen?
l heard voices and songs...
- Permission to speak, sir.
- Go on.
Degleris has his birthday
and because of the occasion...
not being bed time yet,
we were singing quietly.
Do you call this "quietly"?
But this is not what's about.
l also heard a woman's voice.
l pretended for the laughs.
- Do it again then.
- Right away, sir. Listen...
- So you can sing like a woman.
- Yes, sir.
- And you speak with two voices.
- No, sir.
l got carried away and l spoke
in a woman's voice...
while Apostolou
spoke in a man's voice.
We'll talk about it tomorrow,
gentlemen and... ladies.
Hurry up. First of all,
take out the cover carefully.
Hey!
Hey...
Hey, you! Hurry up!
Cha-cha-cha!
What is going on here? Did you
find those inside the boat?
- lt looked good on me.
- Get out of here, silly!
These were found in the boat?
And you heard a woman's voice?
l did, sir.
Would you recognize the men
talking in front of the boat?
Sure...
Costas, don't sit around.
We are arriving at Volos.
Go and take the young lady's
dress very discreetly.
- Shall l disembark in these?
- Yes, with the help of God.
We are sure on the Commander's
side. We'll see about the others.
- l'll change at Volos?
- And you'll give us the uniform.
Poor Nakos will be able
to get out of bed at last.
- Shall we surprise him?
- No. Let's follow him.
The dress is not there.
l looked everywhere.
All clear.
- What happened to the dress?
- lt's a mystery.
- Did you search thoroughly?
- Of course l did.
Guys! Let's face this matter
realistically.
l don't know about the dress,
but miss Alice will go ashore...
even without a dress.
What do you mean? l'll get off
at Volos and strip?
- You'll get off in the uniform.
- And go home like a cadet?
We'll purchase a dress
at Volos.
Yes, but what about the other
dress? This is inexplicable.
lnexplicable! This dress
and this hat, gentlemen...
l would bet that they belong
to my daughter! That's right!
l have no doubt
particularly for the hat...
because l bought it for her
myself in ltaly.
One could say there are many
like it, but what a coincidence!
And it's not only the hat!
lt's the dress, the shoes!
- Who was looking in the boat?
- Degleris.
- A fourth- year cadet.
- Yes, l know.
Please, be very careful
now that we'll get to Volos.
Do a thorough control, but
without anyone realizing it.
And have somebody
watching Degleris.
He's already under surveillance.
And 57 down.
Choose something thin, so that
l can wear it under these.
lt's better like this.
Let's take the dress first...
Right. How could l go shopping
dressed like a cadet?
Aren't we going dressed like
cadets? What's the difference?
lt's not the same.
- The disembarkation's begun.
- Are the leaves in order?
Let's go, guys. And you do
as we said. Be careful.
Bye.
- How long shall we remain here?
- A couple of hours.
- l'll have time to go ashore.
- Propably not.
You'll have to disembark
among the other sailors.
l see. lt's all right.
l'll disembark at Salonika.
We want to do a joke,
to play a game, you know.
We are playful guys.
- What are you doing here?
- Just hanging around, sir.
What's your name, son?
l am the fourth-year cadet
Dimitrios Beliris.
Right...
What's your name?
l am the fourth-year cadet
Panagiotis Dimitriou.
Right...
What's your name?
l am the fourth-year cadet
Nicolaos Apostolou.
Right...
You back there, what's your name?
l am the fourth-year cadet
loannis Nakos.
Right...
Don't go in there.
The Commander is inside.
Let's take these things
out of sight.
Too many dresses, guys.
Too many dresses.
This is a destroyer,
not a school for girls.
So the one is my daughter.
There are documents now.
- Her identification.
- What about the other one?
Two dresses, two girls.
lt's quite clear.
Come in!
There is a message for you,
Commander.
Thank you.
Please, read it for me,
mr. Papadakis.
"Alice disappeared yesterday
when came to bring suitcase. "
"l am going crazy.
Send instructions what to do. "
Here is the confirmation.
You can go now. Thank you.
Aren't you going to send her
a message to put her at ease?
We are arriving at Salonica
in 15 minutes. l'll call her.
- Could it be your husband?
- Since it's from Salonika!
Yes?
Yes!
Hello? Hi!
Yes, l got it.
l said l'd got it.
Don't worry though.
Our pride and joy is here.
She is here, l tell you.
Alice is here.
No, she is parading
right now.
Parading, l tell you!
As what? As a cadet!
Slope arms! March forward!
All the officers are staring
at me. l think they know.
- Pretend that you don't see!
- Oh oh!
- Keep your gun up, miss!
- Pardon?
March without talking!
Haven't they brought the new
glasses l sent for yet?
Not yet.
Come in!
Sir, with all due respect,
the young lady...
- Did she get away?
- She's outside. With the others.
Let them come in!
All four of them!
- You naughty girl!
- Not a girl, sir!
Naughty boy, perhaps.
Not a naughty girl though!
- Alice!
- Here l am, daddy.
Your glasses, sir.
Give them to me, because
it's time we told...
the males from the females.
May l, sir? l am responsible
for everything that's happened.
And what are you, child?
Male or female?
l am a man, sir.
Shut up!
What about the other girl?
- There isn't any other girl.
- Why the two dresses then?
l bought the second one in Volos
because the first disappeared.
l'm telling you, sir,
l am the only responsible here.
Don't listen to him, daddy.
lt's all my fault.
You didn't invite me aboard
the ship, did you?
- He's talking rubbish.
- lt's my fault, sir.
l made a serious mistake.
l have no place in here.
You do! Your place is hanging
from the highest mast!
l'm going to hang both of you!
- He did what he said.
- What?
He hanged them for life.
