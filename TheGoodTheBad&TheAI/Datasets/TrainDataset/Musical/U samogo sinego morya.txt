In the Caspian Sea, a boat
is shipwrecked during a storm.
During two days, the current
drives them southward.
Two days and two nights, the
current carries them southward.
In the south of the Caspian Sea,
in Soviet Azerbaijan...
...there's an island.
What a nice island!
Nice? Really think so?
Don't you agree?
Alyosha, look.
But, what are they doing?
How should I know?
An interesting posture!
They're women!
- Women?
- Of course, women.
You can't even shoot a dead duck...
and when you go out hunting,
people have to duck.
"Soar higher, seagull...
"...night is falling over
the blue sea...
"Hasten your flight and find out...
"... how my loved one fares.
"Tell him how much I miss him...
"... and that my love will never cease."
Alyosha, we risked death...
at least 11 times in the storm...
and I was never afraid.
But saying "I love you" to a woman...
scares me.
How about you?
Anybody here?
- Hello.
- Hello.
Who are you looking for, comrade?
I was looking for someone from
the kolkhoz directorate.
- I didn't find anyone!
- Well, here I am.
- And this?
- My orders.
- What orders?
- Mine. Read it!
There's nothing left!
In summary, what is it
you want, comrade?
Didn't you write asking for a mechanic?
- Yes-
- Well, here I am.
- Mechanic?
- Mechanic.
- Really?
- Yes.
- That's fantastic!
- Why are you so glad?
We were afraid that we couldn't
go out to sea tomorrow.
- Where are all the men?
- Serving.
In the far East...
in the Pacific fleet!
I'll stay for the duration
of the fishing season.
- Who are they?
- Members of my brigade.
- They're afraid of me.
- I don't think so...
Akim, the mechanic's here!
- Are you really a mechanic?
- Yes.
At last!
He's the kolkhoz president.
Welcome.
Masha, take him to
see the motor boat.
Let's go.
Here you are.
- Nice!
- Nice?
Very nice!
- Right, very nice?
- Gorgeous!
Well, have a good look
if you like it so much.
And what's there to look?
I can handle everything!
Motorcycles, cars...
- Planes too?
- Yes.
Liar!
And this?
My favorite necklace!
Go get it!
Jump in!
Go get it!
You little...!
He'll find it, you'll see.
He's a very good swimmer.
Don't worry.
Meanwhile, come with me to the office.
I have the orders.
Here they are!
This one's also empty!
- What?
- It's also empty.
No, the page number and the stamps
are here. The letters disappeared!
Why don't you come with me meanwhile?
He'll find it.
Don't worry.
Alyosha... Hurry up!
Understand?
Thus their life began at the
"Lights of Communism" kolkhoz.
Losing your appetite over a
girl you only saw once!
That's never happened to me!
Don't talk rubbish!
You're also crazy over her!
You like her too!
You're wrong.
I haven't lost my appetite.
You're the one who's smitten!
It's so obvious!
Listen, let's finish this up.
Wait here a second.
I'll be right back.
Bon appétit.
Every morning, with the blinding sun...
... with the tempest and the squall...
...when the cold north wind blows,
or with the burning hot one...
...that comes from India...
...our friends set out to sea...
...with the fishermen from the island.
And one day...
"Through the bad weather in the fall...
"I roam through your places.
"But why do I dream about you, Nastya...
"...in blue-laced ribbons?
"But why do I dream about you, Nastya...
"...in blue-laced ribbons?
Alyosha didn't come on board.
- What do you mean?
- He's not...
I'll go look for him...
Says he's feeling ill.
Doesn't want to go out to sea.
No way is he feeling ill!
He's as healthy as an oak!
What's wrong with you?
The motor boat can't leave without you.
What's the matter?
Are you crying?
You can't start crying just now...
With all this heat!
What's the matter?
Does it hurt?
Should I call a doctor?
Should I?
It's very hot today...
...it won't be fun.
The fishermen will have to go
out with the oar boat...
Alyosha! The motor boat can't
leave without you!
Come on! Push!
All together!
Come on! Push!
At night, when the fishermen
return from the sea...
...Alyosha returns to the city.
Excuse me.
We have to talk.
If I were to talk...
...to an iceberg about
the great suffering...
...in my heart...
...even the iceberg would melt.
Why are you staring like that?
Don't stare at me that way.
Tell him not to look at me that way.
I want to talk to you about my friend...
...my best friend and comrade.
There he is!
A liar and a slacker.
Take a good look at him!
Alyosha, I begged you to come with me!
Instead, he...!
Was crying!
"Should I call a doctor?"
He: "No, it's useless."
We all...
...told him...
"Come, Alyosha, come!"
"Come!"
He didn't budge.
But then he went out.
And where did he go?!
To the city, to buy...
...a necklace.
Stupidity!
You're the only mechanic here!
Do you understand that?
No, you don't.
We couldn't set out on the motor boat.
And how many fish did we catch?
Five times less than usual.
How could you betray the kolkhoz?
And me!
Let me speak now.
You know something? I think
you should marry Mashenka.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Me?
Alyosha... Tell me...
Are you serious?
I'm marrying her!
I'm marrying her!
It'll be a wonderful life for me!
You know... Me and Masha...
...will be like two bodies and one soul.
We will sail the sea together.
We'll have children...
...so many children...
... one, two, three, four, five.
Do you know how I'll
celebrate my wedding?
Imagine. The sea, the seagulls...
...ten boats, one after the other...
...in each one, 22 musicians.
And you'll conduct the orchestra.
And this is what you'll play...
What a beautiful song!
Even the fish will stop and listen!
And we'll be sailing, sailing...
No, not sailing!
We'll be flying like seagulls.
So good!
No...
...I'm not marrying her.
I won't do it. For you.
Listen, let's be frank.
Enough foolishness.
You're not marrying Masha.
Prick up your ears!
I'll never allow you!
And you think I will allow you?
I'll never allow you to marry Mashenka!
And you think I will allow you to do it?
I'll duel over her like
I did in the war!
I'm so scared! And what's
the shouting all about?
I'll teach you!
No, not this way!
What are you doing?
Let's ask her.
What a horrible day!
When the fishing season's over...
...Yusuf and Alyosha must
return to the city.
There's a festive mood everywhere...
...except at the "Lights of
Communism" kolkhoz...
The sea has taken from us...
...a beloved comrade.
It took away our valiant
brigade boss from us.
Mashenka is no longer...
...with us.
We lost a very dear friend.
Who died?
Tell me!
- You died.
- Yes, you.
To the number one female
brigade boss! Mashenka!
Comrades! There are better
stakhanovites among us than I!
Let me down!
Comrades! Please!
Alyosha! You're my friend, right?
Stop it! My head is spinning!
You're my friend, right?
Stop, comrades, please!
Thank you, comrades.
I have things to do now.
Alyosha is waiting for me.
Comrades... He has to try the suit on.
Maybe it's not his size.
Or he doesn't like the cut.
You're right. He's got to try it on.
Perhaps it won't fit.
It's not necessary!
It's my size!
Don't you listen when I speak to you?
Mashenka!
I want to tell you something.
Alyosha's waiting!
Can't you understand?
- He'll wait!
- Fits me fine! Stop torturing me!
No! Don't take my pants off!
Grandpa! They're taking away the
woman I love. Do you understand?
But, what are you doing?
You've got to try it on.
My own happiness could be at risk!
Don't tickle me!
Enough! I tell you it fits fine!
Are you ready?
Alyoshka!
Don't be afraid.
I'm not going with her.
And I say you should go.
I can't now. Maybe some other day.
I'm going, then.
- Where are you going?
- Let me through!
Open!
- What's wrong?
-  Nothing, nothing!
All right!
Grandpa, I told you I didn't
need to try it on.
Did you see what happened?
- I love you, Masha.
- What do you mean you love me?
That I love you. Just that.
What are you saying, Alyosha?
Darling, good, brave...
I don't love her.
What about her?
- I think she loves you.
- Liar!
Ask her yourself.
You don't love her at
all or only a little bit?
Sit down.
We have to talk.
Yes, let's talk.
We'll go by the sea.
I wanted to explain everything
to Alyosha, but he left.
Listen carefully and you'll understand.
Yes, I'll understand.
I love you, Mashenka.
I'm in love with somebody else.
Forgive me. He lied to me again.
- Who?
- Alyosha. He said that you loved me.
- Wait!
- Leave me alone!
Look.
Your brother? Nice looking guy.
He's not my brother.
He's my fiancee.
I promised I'd marry him.
He's far away now...
...in the Pacific.
So what? I love you so much.
I love you!
You have to understand! If you
were called for military duty...
...and had to go far away,
to the frontier...
...and your girl found someone else?
If she got tired of waiting for you...
...would you not suffer?
Think about it.
You're right.
But I love you a lot more.
Come a moment.
Goodbye, Lyuba.
Goodbye, Petka.
- Where are you going?
- Home.
There's fishing there too.
- And the motor boat?
- You take charge.
Goodbye, Alyosha.
Goodbye, Petka.
My regards to everyone at the kolkhoz!
I'll send the boat with the
fishermen back tomorrow!
- Who set out to sea?
- Alyosha.
Where's he going?
He's going back home.
Alyosha's going back home!
Wait for me!
Mashenka, then...
I'm also going back home.
Give my regards to everyone
at the kolkhoz!
With all my love.
- Don't tickle me!
- I'd forgotten...
She doesn't love either of us.
So what do I care!
She's not even pretty!
Why are you lying?
She's very pretty and nice.
And you love her,
and so do I...
...it's just that she was
already engaged.
A fiancee?
He's serving. They've sent
him to the Pacific.
He left four years ago and
she still thinks about him!
And what about us,
if we had a fiancee...
...and they sent us to the Pacific?
Huh?
And if your girl were to
find another man?
Your heart would suffer.
We'd be feeling bad.
Very bad.
Don't you agree?
"Soar higher, seagull...

"Tell him how much I miss him...
