The address is George Uptown
Left side cells, 16th mansions

Please come with us, we need to make some notes.

No, no! Let go!
The crime scene is here, right? Yes.
Go in.
No.
In. No!
What's wrong with you? You must cooperate with us.
Hey? Help her in.
Go in.
No one has ever noticed.
Is there someone that noticed he smoked?
Facing Nancy.
There were many times in the past.
I wanted to come here.
Came to France, because...
...it has a good impression on my heart, and I don't know.
It's just like a love.
Yes, I can understand.
But to this...
...it is not easy...
...to describe within several words.
Not the things on the surface.
It's hard to explain.
But now you are stepping to the hope.
At this moment what are you thinking?
This is very complex.
Becasue it is pale to use the words to express that.
Because something deposits...
...under the surface and it cannot be through.
But my feeling is totally exciting.
The excitement in the travel.
From one place to the other.
Though these travels make me a little tired,
yet I have the feeling of satisfaction.
It's the normal human feelings.
And including the travel in the time.
From one space to the other.
This deed, it's just the happiness that the life journey brings.
So you can do whatever you like.
This is a kind of extrication of the thought.
It's the satisfaction in the process.
It's beyond the form of the surface.
When you are in a strange environment,
Can you have that kind of feelings?
Can you feel strange?
First, you centainly will have that feeling.
But when the time let you enjoy yourself slowly...
...you will forget something.
You won't separate yourself from that environment.
This is your gain whenm you come to the strange place.
And then, you will feel..
...that's a "stable point".
I know it's hard to describe that.
But the fact is just like this.
When you do something, the feeling of you...
...lies in the process.
It's only you who can realize that.
The other people cannot replace your feeling.
But it truly exists and there's no need to prove that.
You have more words on this aspect than the others.
These words are very serious.
How about the time-space change in the life?
I like this feeling.
France gives me so many feelings, and not merely France.
Because they make me know myself.
Anf I can choose my suitable space after that.
I also agree with that point.
Do you have muck ecperience? Because...
That depends on the age, doesn't that?
Yes, if you try to keep with one thing.
For instance on the aspect of learning French.
I just pratice by speaking.
French is the one that you need the courage to express.
You must have the courage to say it out, whether it is good or bad.
There are many things like that, just keep trying.
To try and you will gain much.
This is where the interest lies.
No matter how long you have kept trying...
...something is not satisfactory, and you must force yourself.
That is different with what you said.
That makes me sad... I don't know how to express.
Is there any effective ways to solve that?
Because I have some experience like that.
Of course.
The key to solve these things is themselves.
What the others say is just the indirect experience.
That is not something uncessary that I mentioned just now.
It's connected.
In fact it is also another way.
Transfer between two different space.
Even change the identity.
To release one's own heart.
When you are in a space, you just escape from the other.
And it gives you time to solve that.
Because to the space you are not connected.
This is my thought.
I think that would help.
So I did this.
One time in a space and change the time.
You come to another space and feel good.
The experience of life.
I maybe understand something.
It showed me some resonance.
Did you have some bad time?
Of course, and for instance.
There are some accidents that make you wordless.
It's a complete abnormal track.
Sometimes you can call that abnormity.
You have to accept that.
Because that cannot happen only once or two times, and you cannot avoid that.
So you must find the key and solve that.
Especially when it was severe you must be patient.
Of course, it is not that easy.
I feel your words are a little theoretical.
But the fact is just like this, and you will feel that actually.
That's the same thing, perhaps.
Maybe they are just my personal summary.
That's my experience, and they truly exist.
Though it is a little theoretical.
I should say it is suitable, because...
...the experience of everyone are the same.
This makes the communication between people lack of limits.
The two completely different worlds always have something in common.
Because it is necessary.
This is necessary in large scales.
Though it is very delicate, yet it's actual.
Yes, you are right. And what's more...
...many things are beyond their imagination, right?
Yes, for instance, acception and rejection, rejection and acception.
Not merely the surface meaning.
Sometimes, perhapse.
It's just opposite.
Or some hint.
And there are genius in this crowd.
There are some things that only genius can complete.
This is correct.
But there are some other aspects of them...
...under the surface.
According to what you said strangeness has some other aspects.
The aspect that is familiar.
Something enthusiastic.
We welcome you and that's the lot.
This is true.
But may not be completely possible.
Because in my opinion I need something.
Something mystic.
This is the normal life.
There are some curiosity there.
So I cannot deny its strange aspect.
Especially in such a place.
My feeling is pretty right, OK?
I think it no problem here.
I also think so, no problem.
And you can enjoy that very much.
Yes, but that's not enough.
I think that's a process full of familiary and strangeness.
All is in the process.
All kinds of flavor in the life.
I always feel happy about that.
What I can do is about the regulations.
No, you won't.
That will make you lose interest.
Are we on the stop?
We will get to the stop soon, the final stop? Ten miniutes later.
Yes? What a good talk you have.
But time can finish this, is that right?
During the time....
Why light the torch?
The noon of darkness.
Maybe this world lacks of brightness.
It needs the torch to light.
Drive something away and bring something back.
Especially facing the crowd.
I always think it necessary.
The last minutes...
...of the youth.
Among these several guns...
...which one should I choose?
I want to finish someone's life with it.
I really don't know.
Whether he will like this.
I want you to choose.
You like to die slowly or quickly?
Come on now.
Mom.
He just left like that.
Taking with everything.
Oh, Paula, I don't know whether you're fearful.
The courage.
The last minutes.
The thought.
The last minutes.
"With the thought I'm happy"
The happy thought and the happiness of thought.
Why?
Maybe I will betray this "happiness".
When I betray the thought,
I think I cannot possess this "happiness".
Oh, so many books have been treated as the rubbish.
Some of them...
...seem to be pretty new.
Think it clearly that whether to give up all or not.
Once you give up it will never come back again.
Rubbish car is its end-result.
The last minutes...
...of memory.
It will never expire.
The love.
Tell me you won't leave.
The last minutes.
We will have the smile.
OK, the past and all the past, stop now.
This is our finale, bye.
I always have nothing, nothing.
Before you tell me I know I have nothing.
But I hoe that you won't become like that.
We cannot do this and this is our destiny.
The silent...
...and the last minutes.
They are here, aren't they?
What's the number?
What's the number?
They are in your hand, aren't they?
What's the number?
The last minutes...
...of the story.
We are lead upward.
That place is full of brightness and effulgence.
I know agian that I have the new desire.
Something rise from my heart.
Just like the horse that steps on the road first time.
To be against you I will taste the bitter.
The new way.
Oh, death.
She left forever.
She left forever.
She left forever, I know, she left alone.
I know that someone left means he died.
The horrible...
and the last minutes.
Cruety, war.
But it's the vision we often see and the horror just lies in it.
They seem not to shock the people.
But they make me so shocking.
If I can escape and reject, if I can...
I would rather believe this is just fake.
The last minutes...
...of the forever.
Immortal.
The last minutes...
...of the movie.
The last imago.
The last imago.
He said, dark night.
She said, dark night.
They said, dark night.
The End.
