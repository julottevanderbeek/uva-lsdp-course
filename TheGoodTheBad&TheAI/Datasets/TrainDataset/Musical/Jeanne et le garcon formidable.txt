JEANNE
AND THE PERFECT GUY
Can I take a message?
Call back Monday.
Jet Tours, hello.
Sorry, he just left.
You know, Fridays... Of course.
I'll tell him. Good-bye.
- Seen the runner?
- The messenger, you mean. No.
You're cheerful.
I'm bored.
This magazine's dumb.
Try reading a novel instead.
I can't read a novel here.
I keep getting interrupted.
See what I mean?
I'll put you through.
Triton, for you.
- Are you taking it?
- Not now!
They go on for hours.
I'll pass it to Moutier,
he just left.
Don't forget, Sunday at 7.
I won't.
Sorry, he's left.
Call back Monday...
Okay, Mr Frost?
Can't complain.
But my name's not Frost.
I sell Frost heaters.
But my name's Martin.
I'm sorry.
I don't mind, it suits me.
- What's wrong?
- The usual.
Ground floor?
- Can't you help, Jean-Baptiste?
- It's not my field.
Jean-Baptiste!
Well... I could try.
I'll get to work.
I know the way.
Good luck, Mr Frost!
Call me
when the runner...
I mean the messenger comes.
Please hold, I'll put you through.
All this is for you.
My pleasure...
I'll need you again later...
Nothing for you.
No, I leave in 5 minutes.
Work overtime if you feel like it.
Of course...
Have a good weekend!
Have a good weekend.
You're man crazy, little sister.
- A new guy every day.
- I'm happy.
I should hope so,
the way you collect them.
I don't.
I can't resist, that's all.
- Why should I resist?
- To seem less like a slut.
Screw that.
- What about Jean-Baptiste?
- He doesn't know.
- You lie to them all.
- That's my problem.
- I love them.
- But some expect fidelity.
- I don't tell them.
- Great excuse!
I don't sleep with everyone.
I'm sure I'll find him one day.
-
-
-
-
-
-
It's not Jean-Baptiste
or the messenger...
I'm not sure yet.
There's no mistaking the signs.
How do you know?
Give me a break. I just know.
If the sex is no good,
it's not love.
I can't argue with that!
Excuse me, I'm late...
- One for Springtime.
- Sold-out.
Excuse me, please...
- I forget your name.
- Jeanne.
- You're Francis.
- François.
What're you seeing?
Springtime in Paris
but it's sold-out.
Oh, I wanted to see it too.
Let's have coffee.
- Still a student?
- Come on!
I've moved up in the world.
I teach.
Lucky students.
With you, I'd have worked harder.
- Did you finish school?
- Just about.
I answer phones at Jet Tours now.
- Great for romantic weekends...
- I can't really say.
- You're married with kids?
- No, I live alone.
I haven't got
a guy to go away with.
Me neither. And I get no discounts!
You had that cute boyfriend...
Pierre, was it?
It's years since I saw you.
You couldn't know.
- Sorry, you've split up...
- No, he died.
- How? An accident?
- No, Aids.
What else these days?
- Sorry, I brought you down.
- No, it was my fault.
- It's horrible. What can we do?
- Nothing.
Apart from fight.
I joined Act-Up 4 years ago.
I've seen them on TV.
You should see us for real.
Come to the march next Saturday.
Sure. I'll try to.
You won't find time...
I'm sorry,
the driver's so clumsy!
It was my pleasure.
I'll call you, Olivier.
You were in a hurry.
An urgent appointment?
Am I prying?
No, I'm always in a hurry.
God knows why.
I'm free all day today.
You're not busy?
I am now.
What?
You're going to offer me a drink...
You should buy me one
to apologize.
Haven't I just done that?
I'm running late now.
You were in a hurry.
I have Sunday lunch
with my parents.
You'll get told off because of me.
- Don't keep them waiting.
- Okay, I'm going.
Well... See you around...
Bye.
Sorry, I just realized
I can't call you.
- Got a pen?
- I'll remember.
Okay, 42293099...
See you...
- What a life you lead.
- Don't start, I'm tired.
That's what worries me.
You wear yourself out
...and you don't seem happy.
- I am happy, mom.
No steady boyfriend...
It's not that easy
to find someone, you know.
I try but I can't find anyone.
Look at your sister.
And us.
Sophie and you are exceptions.
Love at first sight isn't for me.
I can live with that.
You have to want love to find it.
Are you really looking for it?
At least go to bed earlier.
- Shit, give me a break!
- Jeanne!
We never taught you to swear.
True, but I left a while ago.
Be nice to your mother.
I am being nice.
Try to be more selfish.
Treat yourselves. Go on a trip.
Visit friends in the country.
We don't want to.
We're fine here.
Okay, if I keep out of your lives,
keep out of mine.
- Are you never on time?
- I can't help it...
- I want to dance.
- I wanted to talk...
- Let's go for a drink.
- No, they're waiting.
Cool it, we've got all night.
Good evening...
- You look gorgeous.
- Thanks.
This is Nathalie...
Jeanne... Jean-Baptiste.
Sit down.
What'll you have?
Same as you.
Champagne.
Another bottle!
- How's the training course?
- Almost over.
- Any good?
- I've learnt a lot.
Management isn't easy.
Will it lead to a job?
Not with them.
But they've given me a few leads.
Finding work's tough.
Right, we're not in the 80s now.
I mean, we deserve decent pay.
We were at business school!
Do you have to?
Sorry, we're boring you.
Try to understand,
it's a big worry.
Maybe but we're here for fun.
Coming to Cabourg at Whitsun?
You bet, as usual.
And Jeanne too?
I can't, it's my birthday.
We'll throw a party for you.
It's my sister's too.
Your twin?
My older sister.
And my mother's too.
All three the same week.
We celebrate and...
Too bad.
We walk, go out riding...
Some other time.
Thanks but I don't like horses.
They scare me.
- I won't have time.
- You work a lot?
Too much.
Doing what?
- I answer...
- She works with me.
Want to dance a tango?
Come on, we're leaving.
It'll take three days to mend.
The bosses don't care.
They never use that washroom.
Theirs is perfect.
The selfishness
of the modern world!
What can we do?
In the meantime...
Any trouble, call me
and I'll pop in.
Okay? Bye then.
- Enjoy your weekend.
- See you soon, I'm afraid.
Is Julien still crazy about his car?
Yes but it makes a weird noise.
That's bad for a new car.
- It's under guarantee.
- I always forget.
New things are like new lovers.
If they break down,
you take them back
...and replace them.
- Silly...
Duck with Chinese five spice.
It's true.
Chicken with cashews.
When old lovers break down
it's no end of trouble.
- But new ones...
- New ones too...
You're so happy. A new lover?
I'll have to tell you.
Both trays.
Any drinks?
Beer?
Two Tsing-Tao beers.
Well? Tell me.
-
-
Aids!
End the epidemic, no more tricks!
- I'm leaving.
- Already?
It's a great march.
It's important.
- I know...
- You're too much.
You turn up for once
then vanish.
You're not like a campaigner,
or a friend.
It's important...
- More important than this?
- I'm meeting a girl.
- You should have brought her.
- It's complicated...
Run, rabbit!
- We'll have dinner sometime.
- Sure...
- I'll call you.
- I'll be waiting, like Penelope.
Aids is war, Act-Up says no more!
- What's all this?
- The march I told you about.
Act-Up's out on the streets.
You're right. I'm with you,
it can't go on.
- Can I cross?
- The riot cops'll stop you.
Shit, I'm late! See you.
See you!
Your place or mine?
- Been waiting long?
- You're here now, it's okay.
- Have a good week?
- Work as usual.
- Not too tough?
- Can't complain.
As long as I get
weekends and evenings off.
You're so cheerful.
- Is that wrong?
- No, it's just rare.
I've been thinking of you.
That kept me busy.
Same here.
So what's the conclusion?
Nothing, I like it.
- I'm glad I met you.
- Thank you. So am I.
What did you do?
I didn't feel too good
so I stayed at home.
- I went to the march today though.
- That's funny.
- Not really.
- I didn't mean that.
It's a coincidence.
Never mind...
You go to those marches?
Sometimes. I feel concerned.
Why? Got HIV-positive friends?
I'm HIV-positive.
That's okay, we used a condom.
- That's a new one.
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
You won't die. I love you.
- Love never saved anyone.
- I believe it can!
- I don't.
- Don't be so hard.
It's not me, it's my disease.
Go on, kiss me.
-
-
- You had a worried look.
- A bad dream, I guess.
- With me here?
- You can't control your dreams.
- I've made breakfast. Hungry?
- Yes.
Don't move.
-
-
I don't believe it.
- You're never on time.
- My life's complicated.
- It's Sunday. What can we do?
- Let's go up to the Sacré-Coeur.
They sell fun stuff there.
- Not the Sacré-Coeur!
- Don't start. I have no choice.
This black guy sells jewellery there.
Perfect for my sister.
- Maybe for your mom too?
- It wouldn't suit her.
- Why?
- My parents are old.
They're both almost 60.
- Did they meet late?
- No, they were very young.
They got married right away.
They were too happy to have kids?
No, it's a sad story.
My brother and sister
died in a car crash.
Grandad was driving.
- Shit, I'm sorry.
- I never knew them.
My parents lived alone
for ten unhappy years.
Then mom decided
she wanted kids.
The three of us arrived later.
- Wasn't it tough?
- No, we were happy.
They were so glad,
they really pampered us.
- Spoiled me, hasn't it?
- Not that much.
That's why birthdays
are so important.
- D'you love your parents?
- Of course.
They hassle me to get married
but that's normal, huh?
Mom wants grandchildren.
My sister's not ready
and I'm too young, huh?
Of course.
Olivier, what is it?
A weak spell.
What? Does it happen often?
Only when I skip lunch.
That's my fault.
No, it's okay.
- I was scared, I thought...
- What did you think?
- Nothing, I don't know...
- That I was going to drop dead?
- Don't say that!
- I'm sorry.
I don't like talking about it,
not with you.
Let's not worry. I'm fine.
I'm just HIV-positive.
There's no need to worry.
Okay?
Let's change the subject.
Good idea...
- Shall we go?
- Let's eat first.
Good, isn't it? Really tasty.
A photo?
- Come on, you're cute.
- I hate photos...
You can't refuse her.
- You can't refuse.
- If you insist.
He can't!
There you go.
I like it.
- Don't let people see it.
- I'll keep it for myself.
Hi!
Hello, sweetheart.
Roast lamb...
You're here, dear.
- With your sister?
- No, by train.
I'll go and change.
-
-
-
-
The army changes a guy
but this is crazy!
We're waiting for you.
I was just getting ready.
I've been busy all day.
- Brought your boyfriend?
- No, it's too soon.
- But I will, I promise.
- Mom was hoping...
Are we eating?
- Rémi's re-enlisting.
- That's his problem.
Yes but I mean...
Just one more.
It's delicious.
There, a lovely slice.
- Rémi first...
- Rare, please.
I'll have that thick one.
- What about Jeanne?
- I'll wait for dessert.
A kiss first...
This one's for Jeanne,
this one for Sophie
and this for mom.
Present time!
- Hurry up!
- Wait for me!
Sit down!
- What is it?
- A film.
Okay...
It's too hard.
- Not that.
- Backside...
Legs...
- Thigh...
- Legs Diamond!
Legs Diamond, is that it?
Another one...
Is something wrong between you?
No, it's me. She's perfect.
She's pretty, intelligent, funny,
and she likes me.
So what more do you want?
What more? 10 years, 20...
I want a life!
I want time to love and be happy!
Why bother loving
if it leads to death?
I ought to end it before it's too late.
Someone will always suffer
whatever you do.
I know, we can't avoid it.
- But I'd rather limit the damage.
- Thanks a lot!
I just don't want others to suffer.
I wish I didn't care.
I'd have good time and split.
But I can't do that.
When I'm with her, time stands still.
I'm hooked, see.
Don't freak out about it.
Maybe she's not so mad about you.
Maybe she'll leave.
You're the one who's ill.
What do you care about others?
- Especially some girl you just met.
- Right, she's a girl...
- You goddam faggot!
- You're talking sense at last.
Let's go and get smashed.
It'll help.
A gay bar, okay?
I can't take straight ones.
I'm putting you to bed.
- May I help you?
- Yes.
- What are you looking for?
- A novel.
We have quite a few.
Can you be more specific?
- Who's it for? Your girl?
- I suppose.
- What does she like?
- Romantic stuff, I guess.
Sure, don't we all?
Not this one... It's a best-seller
but it's no good.
If she likes it,
she doesn't deserve you.
- She doesn't like that writer.
- Very well...
There's Duras
but she's probably read them all.
I don't know.
Maybe it's a bit too...
- It's for her birthday.
- Right, too intellectual.
Something less high-brow...
-
-
-
-
Where've you been?
I was away.
Too bad,
there was this really wild rave.
I wouldn't have come anyway.
What's up?
I didn't want to see you.
It's for you.
It's important. Sirène Express.
- Wait there.
- Where could I go?
I'm putting you through.
Want to go dancing next weekend?
With Richard and Nathalie?
No thanks!
Some other time.
We'll see a movie or a play.
We can go to the sea too.
How about the Basque Coast?
A weekend package.
- It's summer there already.
- I'm too busy.
- Something simpler...
- No, forget it.
I'm not going out with you.
You want to dump me?
Hold the line, please.
Come on, let's talk.
You'll get me fired!
I'll vouch for you.
No, this isn't Radio Nostalgie.
Sorry, I don't know their number.
You're hurting me!
- Let me answer.
- They can wait, I can't.
My contract ends soon.
- So? Good riddance.
- It can't end like this.
Cut it out! What are you doing?
Cut it out! Let me go!
We can be alone here.
Are you out of your mind?
You bastard! Stop or I'll scream!
I'm sorry.
Tidy yourself up, you're a mess.
Mr Martin?
- Not Mr Frost?
- It's not your name.
I liked it.
We were checking.
- And?
- Clogged again.
I called in on my way home.
I'll sort it out.
It needs a major overhaul.
We'll call you. Thanks.
Have a good evening.
You too, Mr Frost.
Are you okay?
It's just a cold.
I'll get some cough medicine.
I always take this.
Forget it,
I take enough medicine.
Herb tea and honey then.
- I hate herb tea.
- It would do you good.
I have to go.
You could stay in bed.
Have your tea and you'll feel better.
Take care, okay.
Excuse me...
- Olivier Lagrange, please.
- Room 19-20.
- Can I see him?
- Yes, he's awake.
- He'll be pleased to have a visit.
- Yes, I know.
- Okay?
- Yes.
Thanks for coming.
You call, here I am.
I'm just checking on you.
Don't let me tire you.
A good campaigner's just
what I need.
Okay?
Act-Up, you mean?
The same as usual.
How's the book going?
- What's it about?
- It's my thesis. I've finished.
I defend it next month.
- You must be pleased.
- Yes, I'm very happy.
You should be. And proud.
- What's it on? Remind me.
- Activism.
I stick with what I know, see.
I write about my own acts,
other people's acts.
That's good.
What will it get you?
Nothing...
Maybe a university job.
That's good for you.
Good work, good pay.
Cute young students...
Stupid...
It'll be a great life.
Sorry, I have black-outs.
I'm glad you came.
I don't feel too good.
- I can't stand the medication.
- It helps though.
I'm always tired.
Nothing works anymore.
Maybe a new therapy will.
- Maybe I don't want to fight.
- Olivier, come on...
I don't want to stay here.
I'm afraid.
- Fancy meeting you here.
- I come here often.
- A second home but no fun.
- I can imagine.
Sorry, a friend's in a bad way.
He's had enough,
he wants to give up.
- What about you?
- I'm fine!
No, why're you here?
I'm visiting a friend.
Nothing serious?
- Something going on?
- You're too curious!
I won't keep you. You're late.
Give him my love.
Sure!
Jealous too...
I woke you.
No, I wasn't asleep. I was thinking.
- Flowers... That's sweet.
- I've brought fruit too.
- How was your day?
- Just work, nothing much.
Nothing much has happened
since I met you.
- I mean nothing equivalent.
- Jeanne...
And you? Do you feel better?
Yes, don't worry. I'll be okay.
When you get out,
I'll look after you.
I'd rather
you didn't come tomorrow.
- Fine but why?
- Because my parents are coming.
You don't want me to meet them?
It's not that.
This isn't the best place
for an introduction.
I'd rather be alone with them.
- D'you mind? You do understand?
- It's a bit stupid but...
You can always call me.
I couldn't go a day without calling.
Surely I can say I love you,
that I'm fond of you...
-
-
So what?
You saw a guy in a bad way?
- You couldn't find the right words?
- No.
There I was, helpless, incapable,
pathetic...
forced to be pathetic.
I don't know
why he wanted to see me.
He must have closer friends.
- Act-Up makes you a specialist.
- Specialist, my ass!
I don't specialize in the dying!
- Accept it.
- I went there, didn't I?
But others do "counselling"
better than me.
Why did he want to talk to me?
I was pathetic.
- Perhaps he's in love with you.
- A dying guy, thanks...
He's straight, he's got a girl.
I think so.
He told me all about her.
He wanted to split up
so she wouldn't see him ill.
- It scared him.
- Understandable...
I wonder...
Maybe he has left her.
I never thought to ask him.
I was paralysed.
I never mentioned her.
I'm pathetic!
You're a perfect guy.
And I love you.
What d'you want?
- Have dinner with me.
- Piss off.
- I want to apologize.
- It's too late, you jerk.
- Why so aggressive?
- Just get off my back!
Don't you get it?
- Is there someone else?
- People are watching!
- That bothers you?
- I'm in a hurry.
- I've a right to know.
- Okay, fine.
Yes, I love another guy.
But he's not why I left you.
You weren't the only one.
Okay, I loved you
but it's over.
I'm not sleeping with you.
Asshole!
NO ADMITTANCE
STERILE ENVIRONMENT
- Why all the precautions?
- Against infection.
- What? Olivier's fine.
- He left yesterday.
I called three times yesterday,
he never said!
That's all I know.
- Where did he go?
- Ask admissions or my colleague.
She's on duty at 9:00 p.m.
Why wasn't I told?
Sorry, I'm busy.
We have a lot of patients...
- Can I ask you something?
- Go ahead.
I had a close friend here.
He's left
and I want to know where he is.
We don't always know
where the patients go.
Couldn't the nurse tell you?
- She wasn't on duty when he left.
- I'll just check.
He was discharged.
I don't know where he went.
Excuse me...
- Where's the maternity wing?
- First on your left.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- Can I have his parents' address?
- I'm afraid not.
Why not?
I can't give out
that kind of information.
If he didn't tell you
...he had his reasons.
- No way!
We're in love.
I must find him.
Don't insist, I can't tell you.
Excuse me...
What time's that nurse on duty?
- 9:00 p.m.
- Okay, I'll wait.
- She won't be able to help.
- I'll wait. Where else can I look?
You can wait over there.
You wanted to see me?
- Tell me where he is.
- His parents took him.
- His parents?
- Yes, he wanted home nursing.
- So you know where he is.
- At his parents'.
- Where do they live?
- I don't know.
He must have said.
If he's your friend,
you should know.
But I don't.
You can't leave me like this.
What can I do? If he didn't tell you,
he had his reasons.
He had no reason. I don't get it.
You must realize...
He's very ill.
Many patients return home
at that stage in the disease.
If he's very ill, he needs me.
We love each other.
He'll be in touch.
- Go home, he'll call you.
- You're right.
Love him well,
he deserves it. He needs it.
Give him our best wishes.
Go on home. Be brave.
Get it the right way up...
Don't you like it like that?
Come on, move it...
It's you!
I never promised you anything.
What are you doing here?
- Have you come to join Act-Up?
- Why not...
I need to ask a favour.
That friend in hospital...
He has Aids and I must find him...
I don't get it.
The hospital won't give me
his parents' address.
- They can't.
- Maybe you could convince them.
- Not if you can't.
- Act-Up can help...
- What d'you mean?
- We could hold a march.
You must be kidding!
- Who is he? Do I know him?
- I doubt it.
- Maybe he's in your files.
- Hold on...
This isn't the CIA!
- You won't help?
- Maybe he just wants some peace.
Just respect his decision.
Thanks for the lecture!
You're like the hospital!
What use is Act-Up
if you can't help people?
Thanks a lot!
- Who's that maniac?
- Some girl I know...
OBITUARIES
Okay?
Yes, no bad news today.
So it's time for good news?
Yes, bring me breakfast
while I wait.
- Coming up.
- Thanks.
-
-
-
-
-
-
- Why didn't you answer?
- I didn't hear you.
What's wrong?
Why didn't you answer?
I have to go.
I have to go home to change,
I'll be late.
I'm rubbing off on you.
- Sure you don't want to come?
- I'm sure.
You're right, it'll be tedious.
I don't know anyone there.
I want to be alone tonight.
- That's not nice...
- See you tomorrow.
See you...
What's wrong?
Come in.
- We could have done dinner.
- It's okay, I can't stay.
Julien...
It's Jeanne.
- I'm disturbing you.
- Not at all.
- You were watching TV.
- It's only a video.
- What was it?
- What's it called?
- A Weekend in San Sebastien.
- I read the book.
- Don't tell us the end.
- I'm not that mean.
- Want a drink?
- Please.
Julien, can you do us
a little pick-me-up?
He's crazy about cocktails.
- A super-duper-double-whammy?
- Perfect.
Take your time
so we can talk.
Throwing me out?
Go on...
Get in the kitchen.
What's wrong?
Still thinking of him?
He left ages ago...
He's forgotten me?
I didn't say that...
He's keeping his distance.
That's his decision, I know.
I've done everything to find him.
I know I shouldn't have.
But he had no right
to make me suffer like this.
I need to see him, Sophie,
to talk to him, to touch him.
We were so happy together.
I can't forget him.
No one's asking you to forget him.
Be patient.
Perhaps he'll come back.
No, he won't come back.
Can I come back?
She should've let you stay.
Look at those!
Classy, huh?
- How do you make them?
- He's got this great shaker.
You two are crazy.
More new stuff!
How do you manage?
- What's it all for?
- Cocktails.
Here I am.

- I'm sorry.
- Just watch out.
Don't get on
when the buzzer sounds.
She could have hurt me.
I have a hernia.
- Young people don't care.
- I'm sorry...
Apologizing won't make it better.
Think before you act.
I know you. You were on the subway
with Olivier Lagrange.
I landed on top of him.
I was often with Olivier.
Where can I find him?
I've been looking for him.
You can keep looking.
You haven't heard?
He died yesterday.
Would you please stand...
It's no use staying.
We don't know anyone.
Let's go.
I don't know if he was right.
- About what?
- Vanishing like that.
Then coming back dead.
Pride, perhaps.
To hell with it...
