Yeah, rise and shine, Napoleon.
Boo, drop a record, loud!
You a gang dude, right?
So you know what an Apache line is.
They beat you for a whole song
to jump you in. Right?
Then we handing you over to my man, Wolf.
Boo, drop that record,
come over here and smack his ass.
Get your ass up.
Come on.
Smack his ass.
Smack him, Boo. Come on.
You got it. Come on.
All right, all right. Stop.
Smack him, Boo. Come on. Come on.
- Not this song.
- I can't hit him like that.
- This song...
- Hey, look, this ain't right.
He loves this song.
What the fuck are you crying about?
Hey. Why you crying, motherfucker?
Please. No more.
We ain't even get started yet.
- I can't.
- You supposed to be hard.
Stop crying!
-Th-- They--
-They who?
I know stuff. I know it,
and that's why he killed my brothers.
Stop sniveling, motherfucker!
Pull yourself together.
Tell me, who the fuck is he,
and what the fuck do you know?
I know he... he set up Fat Annie.
He paid the Warlords to do it.
Please, I don't wanna die.
- I don't want him to kill me.
- Yo, who is he?
No, I don't know.
He smokes cigars
and he drives a Buick. Red.
And he always played this song.
Wolf. That motherfucker.
And, boy, is it lucrative.
With four billion dollars in sales,
Step two, ladies, is getting
the big-time club DJs to spin the record.
-I'm so nervous.
-Don't be.
Look, number one,
your song's a guaranteed hit.
Number two, when it comes
to the business of doing business,
Jackie Moreno has no peer.
All right? I'm a hit maker,
that's what I do.
Is the record pool this way?
Love the shoes.
to every new disco track.
That's why Leslie started the record pool.
She listens and then once a week
the DJs gather at the pool,
they hear her crème de la crème,
'cause she's got the taste.
And these guys make the hits,
not the radio, not the record company.
-I appreciate you seeing me, Miss Lesgold.
-Jackie Moreno.
Mylene Cruz's record is dynamite.
Right?
Long time no see.
My apologies.
That's-- Have we met?
I sucked your dick
in the back of Maxwell's Plum.
Really?
Um... small world.
...two ships passing in the night?
-I was your intern at La Lupe Records.
-No.
I-- I would remember that.
Marion Schwartz? From Scarsdale.
Marion.
Marion, Marion.
Wow, hi.
Hey, what a happy coincidence.
Happy for me, not for you.
-May I just say--
-Go fuck yourself.
With that little bent dick you got.
Bent little dick.
Ezekiel, I'm Claudia.
-I'm... Ezekiel.
-Don't you just hate flowers?
May I take your exterior vestments?
You must be hot.
It's no trouble, really.
I'll just keep it.
Well, suit yourself.
Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Orwell.
Even Salinger.
Prophet of our teenage angst.
First editions, you know.
All my first editions are due at
South Bronx Library by lunch on Thursday.
I'm sorry, are you Carlo Pakoussa?
-Yeah.
-I love you, you're amazing.
Your mix to Misty Holloway "Far Far Away,"
it's my favorite ever.
Thanks. Yeah, I'm proud of that one, too.
- I'm Mylene Cruz.
- Hey.
Leslie Lesgold's listening
to our record right now.
Maybe you could listen to it, too.
If she says it's cool,
I'll do more than just listen.
Listen, I'm not gonna bullshit you.
I regret that we got involved sexually.
-You fucked me and fired me.
-Technically, yes.
But let's be honest. I fired you
because you were a terrible intern.
-I was young.
-Your youth notwithstanding,
you were unstable.
You were surly, you stole.
-Everybody stole.
-You stole from me. You stole my watch.
-You st-- An ounce of blow.
-I was hurt.
Let's not quibble. Did you, um...
-Did you listen to Mylene's record?
-It's a very good record.
My DJs would love it.
-I'm relieved to hear you say that.
-I'm not gonna make it available to them.
And without them and without me...
-your record goes nowhere.
-Nowhere.
So, how do you know Francisco?
His, um...
- His niece and I grew up together.
- Is she cute?
- Claudia.
- What? I'm just asking.
-What's her name?
-Mylene.
Don't feel compelled to answer, Ezekiel.
Claudia enjoys the, shock value
of her little quips.
You into punk?
-I'm not sure what that is, to be honest.
-You never heard of the Ramones?
You don't know "I Wanna Be Sedated"?
Try your vichyssoise.
It's divine.
It's pretentious.
- Claudia.
- Oops.
Okay, you got me. You win. Touché.
What do you want me to do?
I'm gonna exploit you...
like you exploited me.
I'm gonna abuse my power
like you abused yours.
And if you're compliant, then...
we'll see.
You up for this, Tiny?
Good, lock the door.
To estimate the intelligence of a leader,
look at the men he keeps around him.
You have to consider that.
In what sense, sir?
Are you a man willing to make
tough decisions to get what you want?
-I think so.
-Me, too.
You had the intestinal fortitude
to come to my office,
to tell me you weren't gonna kiss my ass
to earn your internship back.
That was a tough decision to make.
It got you here, in my home.
It got you what you wanted.
Thank you.
-You like my home?
-Yes, sir.
I'm thinking about putting a piano
in the front room.
What do you think?
Steinway, Bösendorfer, Mason & Hamlin?
Bechstein. Bechstein's the best.
-How do you know?
-My mother, she liked pianos.
But Bechsteins cost lots of money.
Thousands of dollars.
What if I told you I owned four of them?
Know what I did to get them?
Worked hard and pulled yourself up
by your bootstraps?
Not quite.
This morning, I voted to increase
the cost of a subway token.
And then I endorsed a plan
to close a hospital, near you.
And I blocked the teachers' union
from getting a raise.
And that was before lunch.
You see, leaders make sacrifices.
We are vigilant about the company we keep.
If someone holds us back,
we leave them behind.
-You make difficult decisions.
-Exactly.
Aw, shit. All right, Wolf,
who you take in a fight?
- Bruce Lee or Jim Brown?
- Shao, baby,
put on Wolf's favorite record.
It's time to share the big news.
Bruce Lee all day, man.
You seen
Mr. Lee is lethal as hell.
Motherfucker, come on.
Bruce Lee ain't shit.
Jim Brown could pulverize
his little narrow egg-roll ass.
He fast though.
He fast 'cause they speed up that camera
over there in Hong Kong.
They sneaky like that over there,
right, Slim?
That's my song. Yes, sir.
Y'all won't believe what
this little bad motherfucker did.
-What he did?
He found Napoleon.
And all your dirty little secrets
that came with him.
Annie...
whatever you heard, it ain't true.
What I heard?
I heard it's a man who drives a red Buick.
And loves Cuban cigars.
Who loves this song.
Uncle Wolf here is the one
who tried to kill me.
He broke my heart.
Yes, you did.
-Warlords working for him.
-Tell me that shit ain't true.
Ain't this family been good to you?
-And I was trying to save it.
-Save it?
She's trying to go after Nicky Barnes.
Ask her. You don't have to be a genius
to know that's suicide.
You go after Mr. Untouchable
and you gonna get touched.
-Nicky's a weak nigga just like you.
-Let me finish him, Mama.
No. Shaolin took the initiative...
so he's gonna do the honors.
Could you leave your best friend behind?
Could you take that initiative
to advance yourself and your city
before New York is left to the roaches?
Are you following me?
I think so.
Because if you say yes...
you will be empowered.
And with that power,
you can return to your friends and family
in the Bronx as a leader.
Free of poverty,
free of filth and squalor.
But you have to free yourself first.
You see, it's the friendships we break
more so than the friendships we make
that delineate the intelligent leader.
I've got the power now, Jackie.
Open up.
Open.
Take that in your hand.
Feel the power in that.
The power to take a man's life.
Power can restore justice...
right wrongs...
lift whole communities.
I want you to taste exactly
what it's like to be powerless.
You have the power to stay quiet
or the power to tell.
Power can change people's lives,
improve them.
You have the power over this man's life.
You chose to kill him.
So, kill him. Use it. Use your power.
Feel it.
And when you return to the Bronx,
the friends and family
that you left behind...
Don't hide behind Annie no more.
...and say to you, "Ezekiel..."
-Count to three.
-"...you're not the same."
- "."
- Take three breaths.
"You're not one of us anymore."
-Don't let her run you.
-And on the third one...
-Make her do it.
-...pull the trigger.
"
She might've got your manhood,
but don't let her steal your soul.
I can handle it, Mr. Gunns.
Real good.
Just like I knew you would.
I want the power to change things.
I want the internship, Mr. Gunns.
Next Saturday your friend Francisco
is hosting a campaign event
for my friend Ed Koch.
I'd love you to be there.
Not as our ghetto mascot
as you implied before,
but as a young leader taking his first
transformative steps to help his city.
Endorse Ed as a representative
of the future we're building.
-Could you do that?
-Next Saturday?
-Or do you have something else scheduled?
-My friends and I have this music thing.
I can do both.
Welcome aboard, Ezekiel.
So, how you feeling?
I'm all right.
-You sure?
-Yeah.
Wolf was your friend, right?
Mine, too.
It's hard growing up, ain't it?
Come on. Give Annie a hug.
It's okay, baby.
It's okay.
It's a rough game we play, man.
But it's the only one we got, right?
You a man now.
The kind of man I knew you'd be.
And Annie's got so much love
in her heart for you.
I remember the first day you came around.
Looking so lost, like a little lost puppy.
And we took you in like you was blood.
And now you are.
Now you in it all the way, sugar.
You know, could've been worse for Wolf.
For what he did, what he tried to do,
there was a time when
I would've really made him suffer.
But Annie's getting old and soft now.
So, anybody asks you about Wolf,
what you gonna say?
I don't know nothing about that.
Now I'm gonna need you to,
take over some of his responsibilities.
So, Saturday night I'm gonna need you
on 123rd to supervise.
-This Saturday?
-Yeah, this Saturday.
No, no, Annie, I can't do that.
I got my music on Saturday.
-A DJ'ing thing.
-A DJ thing?
Something I've been planning for a while,
it's important.
Ain't no "buts," man.
"Buts" are for children.
You a man now.
You gotta answer the call.
All right, wait. What if I push
your product at my party instead?
We're gonna have a crowd.
I could move more dust, coke and weed
than every pusher on 123rd combined.
I'm telling you, Annie,
we'll sell so much shit.
I can do my DJ thing and make you
beaucoup profit. I can do both.
I promise you.
Just give me one go at this.
Well, if you say so, sugar.
If it makes you feel any better,
I'm a little disgusted with myself.
Just make sure that the record
gets out to the DJs, okay?
-No chance, Jackie.
-What?
But nice seeing you again.
Yo, Leslie, I--
Come on. I'll go to the police.
-For what?
-That was rape. I was raped.
So was I.
You and your girl are dead
in this business, Jackie.
Please, you gotta give me a chance.
- Fuck off.
- Yeah, fuck off.
You're psychotic.
Most are discarded,
never to be danced to again.
She said it's a hit. Fuck Misty Holloway.
-No way. Really?
-No.
Mylene, in my past, I've done--
I've done bad things.
I just need 24 hours.
Please don't tell your
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry.
But we ain't dead yet.
So, what's, like, Rumi's
ultimate goal in this graffiti gig?
-Goal?
-I can't believe Rumi wants to be
writing in tunnels his whole life.
Doesn't he wanna rise
from some alien ashes?
Be a phoenix? Find a new form?
True, true.
So, let him do it.
Set the alien in the top hat free, bro.
-Introduce him to the world.
-Maybe. One day.
Tonight.
There's an art party in a gallery.
Phoenixes, aliens.
You should come down to SoHo.
...okay, I guess.
Don't worry. They'll let you in.
We'll celebrate this.
To the two most excellent bombers
in New York.
May our wild style
one day see the light of day.
Hi, Sondra.
Jackie Moreno calling for Dan Gold.
But the thing is, Janice,
this is a very time-sensitive opportunity.
Les Lesgold from Turntable Tastemakers
went berserk when she heard "Set Me Free."
-
- Yeah, but listen, listen...
Donna Summer heard an advance pressing
and she fired her whole entire staff.
"Set Me Free" by Mylene Cruz.
I'm shocked you haven't heard of it.
-
- Okay, okay.
It's gonna send the Bee Gees
back to Kangaroo-ville.
Rhonda, be a love and
patch me through to Mr. Weinbaum, dear.
What? Sorry. Who?
Moreno. M-O-R-E-N-O.
No, this is not Jackie Moreno.
Hello? Bernice. Hello?
It's not. All right?
Don't be silly. Don't be silly.
All right, yes, it's me, okay?
-Fuck!
Hey. What's up?
I'm looking for Thor.
Is it cool if I go up?
This is a members-only party.
- Yes, but I was invited by--
- Get out of here.
Let him up.
Just two psychic boys.
I feel psychic.
I've always wanted to read minds.
Yeah, me too.
You gotta get this in a gallery.
An alien with a top hat?
Yes, an alien with a top hat.
Aw. I love him.
What is this place?
This?
This is where
the free people run free, man.
Just birds singing their bird voice.
Doing bird things.
Free people being free?
I brought something for you.
It's my sister's record, "Set Me Free."
When I heard it, I thought of you.
You should get Carlo to play it.
- Carlo?
- Pakoussa. The DJ.
-I kind of know him.
-Like really knows him.
Go.
- My God!
- Ho!
Magnificent, magnificent solitude.
Are they boys or girls?
Both. Boys dressed as girls,
boys with girls trapped inside.
Boys changing into girls.
Girls who got tired of being boys.
Carlo, what's up?
Hey, sugar.
You got some candy for me?
-What you got? Right.
-"Set Me Free."
Better be good.
What are they doing?
Vogueing.
Yes! Yeah!
What's that?
Superhero pill.
I know. I hate my dad, right?
Sorry.
My turn.
It's okay. Go on. Kiss him.
Yeah! Whoo!
He's a good kisser. I liked that a lot.
No, no, no. You were supposed to send
a thousand textbooks
and two dozen school desks.
Instead you sent two dozen books
and zero desks.
Roy Asheton from Marrakesh Star
on Line 2.
I'm gonna call you right back.
Gran Barrio Records,
Francisco Cruz, CEO speaking.
Who's calling please? Roy Asheton?
I know who you are, Roy.
Marrakesh Star Records, right?
Thank you.
Well, yeah, we think the world
of Mylene over here, too.
What? Today?
Well, we're kind of busy over here
right now, Roy.
But you know what, why not?
Well, yeah, me and Mylene, of course.
Well, we can be there later,
you just give me the address.
You're gonna send a limo.
Fine, that'll work.
Okay, we'll see you later on today.
You... take the rest of the day off.
get me Mylene on the phone first.
Whoa.
Hold it! Hold it, hold it. Hold the line.
Hey, hold the line.
Hold the line.
Hold, hold it, hold it, hold it.
Moreno Industries,
Jackie Moreno speaking, how may--?
Francisco.
Francisco,  bro?
It's funny, I was just gonna call you.
I wanted to-- You're going where?
That's not a good idea, that's a bad idea.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You cannot go up there without me.
I'm on my way.
Good cake.
- Take a message.
- Did she say "Teddy Pendergrass"?
So, Mr. Cruz,
-like I said before--
-Hold on for a second.
I don't mean any disrespect, Roy.
But if you're too big-time to take
Teddy Pendergrass' phone call,
how I know what you'll do
with my phone calls?
-Or my niece's?
-Fair question.
Teddy's on tour right now.
While on tour,
Teddy enjoys copious amounts of...
-winter sports.
-Winter sports?
Skiing.
- "Peruvian slopes."
.  yeah. I-- I see.
Teddy'd be broke by Harrisburg
if I didn't ignore his calls.
-
- Cisco! Cisco, don't--
- Hey.
- Don't listen to this guy.
This fucking guy, he's a liar.
-Jackie.
-Cisco, I came down here...
Jackie fucking Moreno.
...to admit my wrongdoings.
I'm gonna pay you back.
I'm just begging you right now
to hear me out.
Is that Jackie fucking Moreno
I see before me?
-I bet you are enjoying this, aren't you?
-You know what you are?
Yeah! It's not good, either!
-You are a fucking genius!
-But that doesn't mean--
You hear me?
A genius, that's what you are.
-Jackie, have some cake.
-You guys-- You guys are eating cake?
- Have a slice, it's light.
- And buttery.
I always believed in you.
You know that, right?
You just needed some tough love.
I provided it, and now look.
"Set Me Free" is a winner,
the first of many.
- You think it's a winner?
- Who gives a shit what I think?
Your record is busting out
in all the gay clubs.
And disco hits don't become hits
unless all the fairies
wave their wands in unison.
"Set Me Free" has a 21-gun salute from
every wand-waving Tinker Bell in town.
-Yeah, I mean...
-How'd you get to Carlo Pakoussa?
Hey, man, I don't-- I don't kiss and tell.
This Pakoussa character, Mr. Cruz,
he's the king of the fairies.
Doesn't have a pot to piss in,
yet his say-so makes stars overnight.
And stars make money.
That's what you're gonna be, Mylene,
if we do this right.
Not so fast with the "we" shit, okay?
What about this contract
that your lawyer sent?
What lawyer?
Ignore the contract.
Fuck the lawyer, he's fired.
We'll make our own contract, together.
An equitable one between all parties.
Right, Jackie?
I'm gonna tell you the truth, Roy.
I asked Jackie about you, and he didn't
have a lot of good things to say.
Okay.
How about I put my cards on the table?
I sell more disco albums
than any other label in the country.
My records go number one,
my artists win Grammys.
If you sign to Marrakesh Star,
you will make more money
than you could anywhere else.
Yes, I take a higher percentage
than other labels.
But that's because I'm the fucking best.
And my employees are the fucking best.
You will make more money and have
a longer career with me taking more
than with anyone else taking less.
Your niece, her two friends,
they're stars.
"Set Me Free" is a hit.
So, feel free to shop around.
But don't wait too long.
I'm fickle
and occasionally vindictive.
My analyst says I should work on that.
I fired him.
So, what do you say?
I say we're a lot alike.
Okay, then.
We're gonna shop around a little,
then we'll get back to you.
-No.
-Yes.
No, no, no, . I want this.
I wanna sign with Mr. Asheton.
Regina, Yolanda and I wanna be
at Marrakesh, same as Misty.
I trust you to protect me
and Jackie to guide me.
I'll let you write the contract
and I'll sign it,
but we wanna be at Marrakesh.
Okay?
Fine.
Roy, you're a serious man.
I'm a serious man, too.
I know you are, I looked you up.
Good. So, then...
-we understand each other.
-Absolutely.
Hey, welcome to the music business.
Thank you.
Thank you.
-Power can change people's lives.
Okay, Okay.
Ed Koch is running a little late,
but you're not gonna wanna miss this,
so sit tight, okay?
Hey, yo, y'all know where Books at?
-No.
-No.
How about you?
You know where he at?
No.
Yo, he said his ghetto mascot
audition wasn't gonna jam us up.
Where's he at, man?
What the fuck is going on here?
Look at all of our beautiful people
here?
You all know how much we've suffered
for years under Mayor Beame.
Mayor Abe Beame, who has proven himself
time and time again
to be an incompetent, insensitive,
bean-counting, pencil-pushing
little midget...
...who has betrayed our people
and our community.
- Yeah.
- That's right.
And then there's Mario Cuomo.
-I like Mario Cuomo. I know Mario.
-Can I have that after?
I used to play sandlot baseball
with-with-with Mario, a long time ago.
, the unions,
they have Mario in their pockets.
That's the truth.
And I like the unions,
but I'm gonna ask you something right now.
How many of you actually have
a nice union job?
- Nope. No.
- That's right.
The unions are not just gonna
open up for us on their own.
Poverty is not just gonna end on its own.
The Bronx is not gonna stop burning
on its own!
I pulled you off the corner because
Annie needs y'all working the crowd.
Annie don't play, so I don't wanna hear
about no problems offing this shit.
- Yo, we got you, Shao.
- All right.
Five twenties to a gram.
Don't take no shorts.
Get that money. 'Cause if you don't,
I'll have hell to pay.
- If I gotta pay, y'all gonna pay, too.
- Get Down Brothers.
Watch out for the stick-up kids.
Where the fuck is Zeke?
We need a guy in city hall
who cares about us.
We need someone who's gonna bring
the proper services to us, right up here!
- We need jobs and safe streets.
- Yes.
Clean, affordable homes for our people.
Ladies and gentlemen, ,
that man is sitting with us
here right now.
The next mayor of New York.
Born in the Bronx.
- A friend of the Bronx.
- All right.
A tough guy for tough times. Bronx tough.
Ed Koch! Give him a hand. Ed Koch!
The sounds you hear.
Deaf to your ear.
Are you ready?
-Damn, man, yo, what is that?
-That's the Echoplex.
We can't fight that without Zeke.
Listen up!
We say ladies first.
Fuck Zeke. We don't need him.
This is a DJ battle, right?
Don't forget, whichever crew
gets the B-boys to rock
is the crew that comes out on top.
Hello, South Bronx!
-How you doing?
-We got no hot water. How you doing?
And let me tell you, that is a crime.
And speaking of crime, how many of you
feel safe in your own neighborhood?
-Spend a night out here and find out!
-I grew up here.
And what I see is nothing short
of a national emergency.
And you know what?
It makes me mad as hell.
How about you?
Yeah!
I'm mad.
I mean, look at this place.
This used to be a nice place.
You see that wall?
You know what that wall said
when I was a kid? Nothing.
Because when I was a kid,
we had a mayor who cared
about hoodlums defacing public property.
Whoo!
Job one when I am mayor:
Francisco Cruz and I are gonna build new,
clean, affordable housing right here.
That's right, right here.
But when we do...
there won't be any more vile,
lawless graffiti animals to worry about.
Because guess what?
I'm gonna pass laws
to put those vandals behind bars.
That's right.
-Yo, Dizzee better watch out.
-Yo, forget this dude.
Mandatory three-day sentences
for all repeat graffiti thugs.
Yeah!
Graffiti will die under Ed Koch!
Yo, turn on the Berthas.
Friends, you all know...
...that some of our brightest hopes
for the future
reside right here in the South Bronx...
and I'd like you to meet one of them.
Come here, son.
This is Ezekiel Figuero...
...the first participant
in the new internship program
at the Fiscal Control Committee.
Ezekiel, you're not one of these,
graffiti bums, right?
No, sir.
And he's certainly
not one of those delinquents
making all that noisy racket over there.
With the boom-boom-boom, is he?
Give Ezekiel a hand.
We can't hear you!
Play! Loud!
Your system ain't strong enough.
We gonna give you a taste of the bass.
Um... I wrote a speech.
But who's got time for all that, right?
So, I'm gonna just riff this.
The-- The super-cool Persian poet Rumi
once wrote:
"Where there's ruin,
there's hope for a treasure."
Now, the other day I was up on 183rd,
and this rich lady called it "taki," man.
But I talked to my man Tracy from 168th.
And he said,
"Listen for the voice of the ghetto."
Yeah.
'Cause it crashes down on you
when you least expect it.
That's you, man.
Even from the cats that stay high...
on 149th Street.
Now, I could daze.
Right.
Or doze off,
or talk about the comets in the sky.
Or how quick they fly by.
Or I could listen.
And say, we're a team.
Aw, yeah!
And as a crew or a squad...
we work together like Moses did...
-
Some--
Some of you know what I'm talking about.
Yeah.
For the rest of you...
let me just say this.
The young people aren't the problem.
We're the solution.
Yeah!
That's what my mama used to say.
She's dead now.
My pops is, too.
But I'm gonna do my best to show
all of you that my mama was right.
Which is why I'm honored to be here.
I'm proud Papa Fuerte
gave me this opportunity.
And...
vote Ed Koch for mayor.
- Yeah!
- All right!
I gotta go...
but the battle for the South Bronx
has just begun.
Well, you-- You lost me there
a little at the beginning,
but you tied it up beautifully.
So, anyway, let's hear it
for the voice of the ghetto, Ezekiel.
Voice of the ghetto?
"Stay high 149,"
I think I've seen that before.
Yeah, keep it to yourself.
- That was amazing.
- Without further ado,
South Bronx's very own Mylene Cruz
and the Soul Madonnas...
who have a brand-new hit
on Marrakesh Star Records.
- Go.
- Give them a big hand.
Fuck you.
- Yo, Zeke!
- Zeke!
- Yo, Zeke. Yes!
- Where you been?
- Yes!
- Man. You made it.
- Yeah!
- Yo, you made it, man.
Yo, he made it, man.
Let's go.
-
Whoo! Whoo!
Play!
Loud!
Shao.
Shao, come on.
Come on.
Go! Go!
Yeah!
Ain't never heard of this shit before.
Nastiest shit I heard since "Apache."
- Shit.
- Yo, that's our joint.
- Mylene, what you thinking?
- Zeke.
He's so fine. My God, look at him.
-Let's go dance.
-You bet.
I smell dust.
Smoke them, that's for sure.
Whoo!
Get down!
-They fucking up them fine disco records.
-For real.
Yo, we made beaucoup cash, man.
Hell, yeah!
It's like another planet, this city.
Ain't it?
You think we can keep one foot
in each world?
You know, me keep my family happy
and be a disco star in Manhattan?
Yeah.
I wanna live there, Zeke.
It's so beautiful.
The Bronx is better.
- We got everything they got in Manhattan.
- Okay.
Plus, we can sit here and enjoy
the beautiful view of them.
But they got nothing to look at
but the fucked-up, burnt-out
-
-
-Francisco,
-No, we shouldn't be doing this.
It's gonna be okay.
-That's our girl.
You made this happen for her.
