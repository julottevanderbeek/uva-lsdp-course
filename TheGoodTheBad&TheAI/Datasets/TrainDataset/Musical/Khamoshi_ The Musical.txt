Papa, can you hear me?
... but what is life
without an impossible dream!
Joseph, you look very happy today
Your daughter is coming?
Son-in-law too!
lt's good. Very good
SILENCE an album by...
Annie and Raj
Forget it, man
Just let it go
Annie...car...an accident!
Can't say anything for 24 hours
But there is hope if she comes to
in the meantime
She will be kept under observation
Sister, have one more
Nexamethazone injection ready
Today while death is so close...
l can see through my whole life
An absolute and rich life...
which we all lived
Always lived together...
through thick and thin
Joseph! Joseph!
God has blessed you with a baby girl!
And there begins...
An incredible dream...
lf my papa could call me by my name once
l saw this dream the day l was born
But life is meaningless...
without an incredible dream
Joseph!
Yes, my son! She can hear
She can hear!
There is rhythm in her voice!
This house has got voice
after so many years
After many years!
My sweet child!
My birth brought new beginning of voice
in my parent's life
ln their silent life...
even the sound of my cries was
a source of joy for them
Mariam used to say that...
At the time of my birth
l cried in rhythm of shells
So l was christened Annie
Annie Joseph Bergenza
Our house was full of silence
as well as sounds
Mariam introduced me
the rhythm hidden in it
Noise of waves
No...the rhythm
Since childhood my life had divided
in two different worlds
On one side there was the silence
of my parent's life...
And on the other side there was
Mariam's music
Did you sell the soap?
Don't worry. We stole two fish
For eating
Me and Annie
Stealing? This is not stealing
Everybody does it in childhood
It's just a play
This is not stealing
Fishermen also steal it from the river
ls it wrong? Then what is right?
ls it right if children sleep hungry?
No! Papa! Please!
What are you doing?
Listen to me!
No, Papa! No!
You couldn't sell soap so you're
taking it out on children
Damn the people
Do people feed your hungry children?
You have not been disgraced
One day your daughter will become
your voice
Remember this!
l am the wife of a freedom fighter
What did we get after independence?
Only this house
But they didn't realise
we needed food also
Your father didn't give his life
for the sake of truth
He gave up his life because
he couldn't face the truth
What's the truth?
The truth is that he died because of you
You are deaf and dumb
He couldn't stand the truth
So he died there
Did you hear me?
Did you!
We are from Super clean factory
It's new product of our factory
Three rupees for one piece
Two pieces for five
lt's gentle to your hands too
We are from Super clean factory
This is a new product of our factory
You...
We are from Super clean factory
It's a new product
Please give us one more chance
Two for three rupees, one for five
Wrong! One for 3, 2 for five
Correct?
We are from Super clean factory
This soap will be kind to your hands too
along with your clothes
Please give one more chance
lf you use it once, you'll want
to buy it again and again
One for three, two for five
Only three packets!
You sold only three packets in ten days?
Enough! No more business with you
You are fired
We do work hard but
people don't understand
Give us one more chance
You are not worth a second chance
You've always been fired
from every employment
The only alternative left for you
is begging
Hey, girlie! Tell him
l pitied you because you were deaf
You take this little girl with you
on work
You don't understand what she says
Neither can you explain anything
to people, and you want another chance!
He has got no choice but begging
Take this money as alms
and get out of here
l don't want to see your faces again
Help me!
Papa, please don't do it!
l took sympathy for this mute
and now he is beating me!
The deaf is beating me!
Let him go, guys
He can do nothing to me!
l took pity on this bloody deaf!
No, Papa, please don't
Someone please help me,
he's going to kill me
Suddenly l felt grown up
to see my father's helplessness
l began to understand why l
couldn't steal fish even for a game
We are different
People don't understand us
No! Mom, No!
Please, No!
Mama, please don't kill it! Please!
Eventually the music vanished
from our life...
and silence was everywhere
Papa was jobless and we parted away
from our dear things
Come on!
Be careful
This side please
Please keep it straight
Watch it, man! It's very delicate
l watched my piano being taken away
l was parting from a dear friend
l felt as if it was urging me to stop it
It wanted to be with me
Don't cry, my child
What parts away comes back
sooner or later
Remember this
Listen! Music is alive
as long as our heart goes on ticking
Now everybody will sing...
...with our piano, right?
Mariam passed away
but her memories were always with me
l can still hear her songs
Her song's became my strength
lt was my guiding light
throughout my life
lt guided me in difficult times
Thank you
Thank you, Mother Mariam
Come on, children
Willy became our friend
Because of him there was piano
in our life once again
Happiness was returning in our life
You see, this is how it is played
Papa was working in a toy factory,
where even an ordinary pipe seemed
a bugle to us children
You scared me!
Now this box will sing
l don't believe this box can sing
By God it can!
You are joking, right?
You don't believe too?      No!
Why?
Mummy says never listen to people
who can hear and speak
Ain't l your friend, Willy?
l never tell lies
Just a minute. Put it here like this
And here it goes
Really! It is indeed singing
What if we fix it
in our parent's throats?
Will they be able to speak?
No. It cannot be fixed
in any body's throat
lt can sing other's voices
One day it will sing our Annie's songs
Remember this!
It is going to happen one day
Sam! Sam!
Mom is calling for prayer
l won't come. You go!
Come down!
Sam!
Sam!
Mom! Papa!
Mummy, Papa
Papa, papa
Sam, Sam!
Come on, hurry up
That day...
l heard papa's silent cries
for the first time in my life
l never forgot those cries
The cries of helplessness
And anger towards God
There was sadness in our house
after this incident
l was lonely
Mummy and Papa kicked God
out of their life
They had only one hope,
Only one truth
And that was me!
They lost faith in God
But l was sure God would come back
in our house
PLEASE SING NO SAD SONG FOR ME
Thank you
Thank you
Uh, no! Please stay still
lf you leave,
my music will be incomplete
Thank you. Just for a few minutes
lt's over
Would you like to hear my music?
Just think
A beautiful girl
went in a light house...
with this tune on her lips
Her voice was full of magic
People used to come to hear her voice
from far off places
And her voice became popular
in the whole world
The flute comes at this note
Flowers would blossom at her voice
Even the impossible
would become possible
lt would seem like
all the seasons had joined hands
And her voice reached such heights...
that no one could ever imagine
The whole world sang with her
When she would sing,
everything else would stop
lt would take people's sorrows away
The whole world was mesmerised
And then suddenly...she stopped singing
Why? No one knows
There was no answer
to people's questions
Something will be always be amiss
in my life till l get back that voice
So tell me, what do you think
about this tune?
Like it?
Thank you
Hang on...thank you
See! Mariam also wants you to stay here
Weather is so pleasant
l can do anything in such weather
For example, l can guess your name
Auntie Sophia... No?
Khatima... No?
Usha Dai... No?
Then?     Annie
Annie!
Annie...You look very beautiful
when you laugh
You look very ugly
Thank you very much, Mother Mariam
A nice tune indeed
Where did you hear it?
lt's the voice of my heart
l've composed it for a very pretty girl
Oh, l see!
Willy?      Yes
You can sell this piano now
No, my son
l will not sell this piano
Tell me some thing
lf this piano were very dear to you,
a memento of somebody's love...
Would you have sold it?
God bless you
There you are!
You always leave your shop unattended
Accounts are ready
There were so many mistakes
Mistakes can be corrected
You go now. l will come soon
Don't take too long
Yeah, yeah, l am coming
What's this, Willy Uncle
You've even left the piano open!
You know what...
Your voice is more beautiful than you
You must be wondering as to why l'm here
l came to buy this piano
But now l know, this piano is
very dear to somebody
Now you must be thinking about
the goings-on of my mind
l'm thinking that how will l be able
to go away...
after being so close to you
Today l am very happy
Because l have heard your voice
l have found the voice
l have been looking for
You still have this with you?
Uncle Willy has still been keeping
this safely
You remember Sam and l used to hear it?
And how we used to dance!
Papa, shall we dance?
Please, Papa. Just once
Yeah!
One, two, three and...turn
Mummy, do join us
Mummy
Mummy! Stop
Mummy's sewing machine
is making too much noise
Papa! Just a minute
Mummy! Mummy
Please stop it for a while, the music...
Mama, look at me
Can't you stop it for a while?
But why?
Why can't you stop it?
ls it very urgent?
What difference would it make
if you were to stop this for a while?
Mummy!
But why? Why do you hate music so?
Why doesn't Mama listen...
Father, l have a confession to make
Speak, my child
For the first time in my life,
l yelled at my parents
l love them too much
l didn't even think once
what would happen to them
They have nobody except me
And l know this very well
lf you feel sorry,
God will definitely forgive you
Father, l'm very afraid
l feel that there is a
whole new world out there beckoning me,
lf l step into it,
l will be away from my parents
That world is full of happiness
But l don't want such happiness
which l can't share with my parents
Whenever l hear the sound of waves...
l hear music, l hear a song...
Whispering of leaves
l feel like l am committing a sin
Annie, l cannot understand your sin
Music is a God given gift
It's not a sin
Whatever you want to confess,
say it frankly
Father, these days l am being attracted
towards somebody
So, this is the problem!
Who is this boy? Is he from our village?
No, he is an outsider
What is his name?
l don't know
You don't know even his name
and you're getting so upset!
Father, actually l...
Just a moment
Father, l have to speak to you
Wait for some time
a confession is in progress
There seem to be more sinners
than priests, l guess
Am l right?       Right
Good. So, some sinners must wait. Right?
Right again. Me a sinner!
Sorry, my child
Ok, tell me where did you meet this guy
ln the cemetery
Cemetery?!
lf it would have been a funeral
then l must have been present there
No. l just went there...
Without any reason, to the graveyard?
And then?
Then he met me in Willy's shop
l just happen to meet him so suddenly
every time. Just like that!
lt seems as if he is present here too,
somewhere
Just a minute
Sorry for the disturbance
Can't you wait even for a while?
Have you heard about something
called patience?
No
No? Anyway, tell me
what do you have to say
l have to confess something
l know. You didn't obviously come here
for a cup of tea!
No?
You are here to confess a sin
No
No?
l came to confess my love
Father, how can meeting a lovely girl
be termed as a Sin?
And that too, in the graveyard
ln the graveyard?
According to me it would have been
by the grace of God
She happens to meet me suddenly
Everywhere
All of a sudden, anywhere!
Yes, when l lift up my eyes,
l find her there
On the way when l turn back,
l find her in front of me
When l see her
l wish her scarf to fly away
lt does fly
Right. l go in a shop and find her
playing my tune on the piano
ln Willy's shop
Right, Father
lt's truly a miracle
Of course, It is
When did you meet her?
Three days ago
Since then l have been very excited
l know nothing about him
Except that he composes music
l know nothing about her
Except her name
Annie
What! Do you know her?
Oh Father, you are not father,
you are a grandfather!
l must touch your feet
Go back in the confession stand
Sorry,  l got a little excited
Love doesn't mean
that you've to be desperate
lt's not meant for only enjoyment,
it's not a sin either
lt is an enduring sorrow, and patience
Can you do it for our Annie
Father, l love Annie immensely
l can do anything for her
Good. She is here
This thing did cross my mind
Go and express your love
l am mad at you
Why didn't you tell me...
that you had been promoted?
Even then...at least you should have
told me and Mummy
Sun?
lt gives light to whole universe
And yet speaks nothing
Papa, l am very happy
l am proud of you
How do you feel?
Papa, we ought to celebrate
We will indeed
We will buy a car later, first of all
l want a red dress with frills
Papa, listen to me
l need a new dress
l want to look beautiful
in the coming carnival. Papa, please
You've always worn clothes sewn by mom
But l won't let it happen to me
Mom will listen to me
First l will talk about promotion
Mom will be very happy
Then, l will tell her
about the new dress
lt's a bet
lf l lose, you give me nine punches
Alright, but if l win
l will give you nine
Today, l scolded Papa
He didn't tell us about his promotion
We will celebrate
Papa promised me a new dress...
Mom has already had it ready
So pretty!
Shall we go up?
What is it?      l am scared
Hold my hand, then you won't
Shall we go?
Now what?
Do you trust me?
Then close your eyes
Come on, now
You trust me so much
And you don't even know my name!
l know       Really, what is it?
Raj
ln my childhood, Mariam used to speak
about this prince
He would come in a plane
and take me somewhere
ln the world of magic
ln the world of music
Where there will be no darkness
Only happiness and joy
Did you say something?
No. Nothing at all
Do you know why did l bring you here?
Don't you know why l brought you here?
Nobody can see us here,
no one can hear us
No one can hear, no one can see
Come closer
Come close to me, Annie
And say
Say what?
l've brought you here so that...
so that you can say, ''l love you''
You were scared, right?
Please say it
Say it
Oh, come on
Say it
Say that you love me
Okay,  Say,  ''l''...
l.  .  .
''Love''...
Okay say, ''l hate you''
l hate you
Again
l hate you
Again
l hate you
Again
l hate you
Again
l love you
Again
l Love you
All right
l hate you too
Freedom
Flight
Eventually Papa bought
one second hand car
The whole world became
a steering wheel for him
Which he could control as he liked
Papa was as excited as a child
Your dream has come true
To own a car
Today my dream will come true
Annie will sing. Yes, she will sing
Papa, he wants me to sing
l don't know, l haven't decided yet
Hey, listen! Let me explain
Raj heard Annie's voice
He liked it very much
Raj wants to record Annie's voice
l will explain you everything later
Let's go
l told you not to buy this junk
Now l have to push it to start
Didn't you tell them about Raj?
l did not get a chance
Chance...you ain't going to get one
without going for it
Raj is an outsider
He doesn't even know
l live in a different world
l don't know whether my parents will
approve of him
lt's not about Raj...
They won't let any boy come in your life
They have to live their life
on their own without you
You have to explain it to them
l cannot do that
What?
Are you going to look after them
your entire life?
Can you live without Raj?
My normal life was slipping away...
And Raj was attracting me
in his own world
l lived in anticipated fear,
whether these two different worlds
could become one!
Annie, welcome to the world of music
l always wanted to bring you here
To this recording studio
This is not only a recording studio...
This is our church
This is our world, our earth, our sky
Can you feel the silence?
This silence is full of music
The history of music
l get overwhelmed whenever l come here
Since childhood l always wanted
just one thing
Music
Only music
Listen carefully
You feel as if you hear old songs here
The voices of great artistes
What do you hear?
l hear Mariam's voice
l hear her songs
The buoyant laughter of Sam
That childhood rain
Those dreams
Your dreams will come true
We will work hard towards them
And then one day...
You will be standing
in front of the microphone
And...
Drums over here. Saxophones over there
Flutes, violins, trumpets,
guitars
Annie, you will be surrounded by music
And everything will be silent
And your voice accompanied by
a perfect rhythm,
will reach Mariam
And the whole world will sing with you
Mama!
Papa?
Can't you hear?
Look over there. Mom needs help
l am sorry, Papa
l shouldn't have shouted at you
For a moment l forgot
that you couldn't hear
l am sorry
Nothing will happen. l am with you
l will never leave you alone now
Never
After mom's heart attack, l realised...
l had to be there for my parents
Every time, every moment
l decided to break up with Raj
But there remained many unsung songs,
Many things which we wanted to share,
but couldn't!
Annie?
Annie
Don't take that bus, l am coming
After all, what is the matter?
Annie, l love you...
and you love me too
Then what's wrong with you?
l waited for you at the rehearsal hall
but you didn't turn up
You saw me on the road
and just ignored me
Why all this?
Why don't you speak?
You have to answer
l can't live without you
Neither can you without me
Then what is it that is creating
the distance between us?
Why don't you say something, Annie?
Did the cat get your tongue?
Are you a mute?
Yes, l am indeed dumb
lt's just between both of us
Annie! Annie?
Where are you taking me?
Annie, what are you doing?
They will wake up
They won't
Shout! Cry! No one will hear you
My parents are mute
Had l not reached in time...
anything could have happened to mom
l can't sing, Raj
l cannot sing!
Sorry, Annie
Annie, l am not taking you away
from them
Actually l want to give them
their son back
And you will sing for them, not for me
Because you are their voice
They cannot hear you
But would at least be able to feel it
Even if you were like them...
l would have loved you
Yes. Do you know why?
Because l love you
l love you
Eh what! Just now you were asking me
to shout
We waited till Mama was better
Raj always used to dispel any fears
that l had
l now wanted to sing,
without any fear
l wished to experience life with Raj
without any burden on my heart
Happy birthday, Papa
Sorry, l got late at the rehearsal
Your favourite flower
This isn't your favourite flower?
Yes, your favourite is...
lt's Mama
My favourite?
Not you?
Music?
No, Papa, you both are dear to me,
not the music
Today l was late because
it was the last day of rehearsal
l rehearsed with a full orchestra
There is a recording tomorrow
l'm very nervous
You will have to accompany me
What is so funny?
People?
They will laugh at you
Why?
Because you cannot hear,
And are going for
your daughter's programme
Over there nobody knows you
Papa, l don't feel at all ashamed of you
No, nothing doing
You will have to come with me
Tomorrow is a very big day for me
l will not sing if you won't come
No!
You hate music, right?
So, you won't come
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
You always say that my shop is crowded
This is just one, but l've enough space
for ten christmas trees
Jingle bells, Jingle bells,
jingle all the way
Willy?
Where's the piano?
l sold it.  l sold it,  my child
Somebody offered a good price
l couldn't refuse
For the first time in my life
l made so much profit
lt looks so beautiful
in the piano's place
We will decorate it. This is
the happiest christmas of my life
Merry Christmas, Willy
Mariam was right
Whatever parts away,
comes back sooner or later
My piano also came back
Thank you, Papa
Uncle Willy, You lied to me
You fooled me
l didn't lie. Look Joseph! Hold her
Hold her please
Just let me get my hands...
Merry Christmas
Just a minute
This is the biggest Christmas of my life
Thank you
Papa, he came to say that the people
liked our song very much
He could wait till tomorrow
But he wanted to share with us
this happiness today
You hate him
But l love him very much
Too much
Raj, you don't understand
Papa is very angry
He won't listen to anything
Last night he was mad at me
He doesn't want me to have
anything to do with you again
He says you can't come to our house
And neither can l sing hereafter
Annie, your hands are so pretty
Your hands are very ugly
Very funny!
You shouldn't have come home
at that hour
That's why Papa is annoyed
He IS right
Hey, don't you go changing yourself
Yesterday you were singing
something like... l'm very happy...
Okay, tomorrow l'll talk to your dad
about our marriage
l don't think marriage would be possible
Why ever not? It's very simple
l will show you
Raj is standing here
wearing a black suit, looking handsome
Come, fatty
Annie is here, standing near him
in a white dress, looking just okay
The priest says,
Raj, do you accept Annie
to be your wife?
l do
Annie, do you accept Raj
as your husband?
Try to understand
Do you?
lt's not that simple...     Do you?
Do you?
l do
And now you may kiss the bride for...
one hour
lt's not that easy as you make it sound
Annie, l say stop otherwise...
Otherwise what?
Or else,  l will follow you
Annie?
Annie, stop
Annie, listen to me
Annie, Annie!
Annie, Annie, please wait, wait
Sit here for a moment
Look, l'm not kidding
Tomorrow l will speak to your Dad
You know, l even know the sign language
Just watch. Hi! Bye!
Flying kiss. Glad to meet you
Too good
Happy wedding
l...do love...your daughter
lt's good.  It'll work
Looks like Uncle is sleeping
Hello, sir. l am Raj
l came to speak to you about Annie
Your daughter Annie
About Annie
You know, l...
Do you understand what l am saying?
Looks like he doesn't
Sir, Annie and l...
Okay, let me put it down for you
What do you read; English or Hindi?
Here
Mr. Joseph!
Uncle!
Please listen to me
Sir, slowly. l have an ailing knee
Sir, please listen to me
Sir, only two minutes
Oh, l see. You prefer to talk
while walking? Okay
Let's just sit down
You know, Sir, l...
l like Annie very much
Sir, l love her too much
Sir, l wish to marry Annie
l will keep her happy
l know you wouldn't want her
to leave Goa
But l too like it here
Sir, l love Goa
We will get along very well
Sir! Please, sir
Okay then! Go ahead
Keep your daughter in your own world
Like father, like daughter!
Both giving me a tough time!
Go
Sorry, Sir!
Sir,  l love your daughter, sir
Sir, please listen to me
l cannot live without Annie
Please help me, Sir
Please, sir
Okay, sir
Kill me
l cannot live without your daughter
You might as well kill me
Come on, break my head
Papa, please talk to Raj once
He wants to see you
So what if he is from Hindu caste?
Why can't we marry?
You and mom also loved each other
l am asking for your permission...
But you eloped with Mom
Papa!
Mama please explain to him
They are here
Now it all depends on you
Don't be nervous, okay?
Smile please
Hello Annie
My parents
l've heard your song
You are as beautiful as your voice
l won't flatter you
Hello        Hello
Meet my parents
Hello
Glad to meet you
Raj always talks about you folks
That's why we decided to...
decided to see you
Really, it's a very lovely place
As beautiful as you are
Shall we go in?
Please come in
Your wife?
Yeah she is very beautiful indeed
He meant that Mama cooks very well
He meant that his wife cooks very well
Yes, very tasty food. Very nice
Excuse me, may l have some water?
Water, water
Thank you
Excuse me     Sure
What's wrong with you?
Didn't you promise not to be angry!
l know that outsiders never visit us
lt's hard for you. But it's hard
for them also. So is it for me
Why are you losing heart?
lt is a good opportunity
to open up to people
Mom, we all are a family now
Nobody is mocking you
Just a minute
You have to trust them
You have to try and reach out to them
You never talk to others
You are confined to your own world
Why, mom? Why?
Don't hide yourself from others
Share your feelings with them
Say something
Very strange people!
They are making so much noise
Mother, what seems noise to you...
is in fact a silence for them
Check out my dive jump here
Oh, my elbow, my elbow!
Come, come
One minute
Here
Cover yourself. C'mon
Was l exposed?
Yeah, you know that thing... !
That?
Hiccup
Hiccup!
l think somebody's missing you badly
Must be my parents
No! No, Please!
No, l have to go
No, look, please don't go
l mean, you've just come
l got to go
Tomorrow l am leaving
You will have to spend whole day with me
Without your hiccups and without
your Mama and Papa, okay?
Okay
Annie, my shirt!
l will keep it with me
l won't leave tomorrow if you don't come
You have to come
Joseph! Be careful!
Mom, please
Why do you employ
such handicapped people?
Joseph has been working here
since last 1 5 years
He is a good craftsman
That's okay but any accident can happen
Like it happened today
You cannot alert him
because he can't hear
Doctor, would his hand be alright?
Yes, but it will take time to heal
Do you have any other problem?
Any other problem?
Papa, any other complication?
No, he is all right
But his hand must be taken care of
No, nothing will happen
l will come home for the dressing
Call me if there is any emergency
Papa thanks you
Thank you
Annie, l have to speak to you. Come
Look Annie, we will pay
for this treatment
But we can't employ him further
What did you say?
He will have pension though
We have our own problems...
Papa's hand got burnt...
and you're saying you want to sack him!
He's worked at your place for 1 5 years
This thing occurred at the job
He is in such an agony and you want to
talk of pension!
What do you think you are, huh?
Papa says that he will
return to work soon
Raj
Raj
Listen to me
Mother was very upset
l couldn't leave her alone
Suddenly Papa...
Mother! Papa!
And what about me?
Am l not a part of your life?
You knew l wouldn't leave
without seeing you
And yet you didn't come!
You were right
We live in two different worlds
We can never be together
Take care of your parents
l am going
You are leaving?
Now that l need you most
and you're leaving me alone?
Papa's hand got burnt
His hand got burnt today
And you know what these hands
mean to him!
They are his voice
But you will never understand!
l know what you're thinking
You're wondering if l will ever return
Right?
You're just thinking that
Look at me, Annie
Hello! Not now
Later when l come back
You're really pretty when you smile
You look very...
very ugly
l love you
l had my fears when l saw Raj leaving
What if he didn't return!
Now you're always with me
Not only in my dreams,
but in my body too
Raj, my mind is full of
aspirations and fear
l have started loving myself
Because he is in my body now
l wish you were here!
How will l explain to Mom and Dad?
l have made a mistake
Abortion?
For the fear of what people might say!
Wise thing?
ls abortion a wise thing to do?
l won't go against the church
l will not go against God
You don't have faith in God
But you have faith in life
You want to kill my love?
We will soon marry,
don't you go getting upset
Raj will surely come back
He will accept me
l don't care about people
You just accept me as l am
l will stay here
ln this house with my baby
You are right
l wish l had died instead of Sam
Papa!
What are you doing?
Don't beat her!
Don't fight because of me
Listen to me!
l am not irresponsible
For twenty years l forgot my existence
and lived for you
And you call me irresponsible!
l am not
For you l was only a voice
Two soaps for five rupees
l didn't know the meaning of this
But l kept on saying it
on your insistence
And now you accuse me of being
negligent of my duties
People used to taunt you
and only l could hear
l even couldn't cry
because you were there
And l am irresponsible!
When you bought a coffin for Mariam
At that time l didn't know
what death was
And you blamed me for Sam's death
And l am irresponsible!
l am irresponsible
l didn't get to enjoy my childhood
And now that l want to attain motherhood
you want to take away that too from me
Whole life l supported you,
looked after you
Now it's your turn
Until you bear this responsibility...
l will not return home
Did you hear?
Did you hear me?
Two for five rupees, sir. Please buy it
Give us one more chance
Speak with smile
Who taught me this?
l am sorry. It was a mistake on my part
No, mama
lt's not your mistake
l shouldn't have said all that
Sorry, Mama
l am sorry
Papa has agreed?
Being a mother yourself
you're suggesting abortion?
So what if my child were like you?
So what if he's born deaf?
My child will be a part of me
l would never curse my child
No, mother!
l know your life has been
that of hardships
Even then you lived your life
so courageously
l was never sorry
that you were my parents
l am proud of you
lf my child were like you,
l'd be proud of it too
After all it'd be my own child,
my own flesh and blood
Goa! Yeah
Okay everybody!
Bye! See you. Have a nice time
A frilly frock for Annie! Yeah
Annie!
Driver, please stop the bus
Annie, l love you
Raj!
Raj!
Listen, she needs to get on the bus
Hey, watch out there
Sorry
Thank you
Stop! Stop the bus
Thank you, driver
Annie!
Annie!
Stop the bus
Stop the bus please
What are you doing?
You are stepping on my feet
Raj
Stop the bus
Annie, l miss you
Excuse me, please stop the bus
Stop the bus!
What is it?
Nothing
l love you
You look lovely when you smile
You look very...
ugly
Beautiful
Papa, it was a mistake on our part
Please forgive us
We never wanted to go away from you
We always wanted to come close to you
l know one day he will forgive me
You may kiss the bride
lt all seems just like yesterday
Our wedding
Papa and Mom were not there
The happiest moment of my life,
was so incomplete without them
Hello
Yeah, Raj also says that
he looks like Papa
Mom, where is Papa?
Annie taught me
Sam
Your son Sam
ln the name of the Father
the Son and the holy ghost
l hereby baptise you
God bless you my son
Once again we had faith in God
And all the joys of life came back
Sam has come back in our lives
Our best wishes are with him
Annie grew up in our tiny village
Today she has become famous
Singing Star
We are happy for Raj and Annie's success
But we are sad to see them leaving,
on such a occasion l want...
Actually all of us wish...
Joseph to come on stage
and share his feelings with us
Come Joseph
Come on, Joseph
Don't be shy. Come on
Everybody wants to hear you
Go. Come on
Today...
l am very happy
l don't believe that...
you all wish to hear me
There are so many more things
that l want to say,
but l feel at a loss to express myself
Since childhood people have been
calling me handicapped
They'd come at our place...
look at me and call me deaf and dumb
They pitied me
Some people even made fun of me,
laugh at me
But today l have no complaints to God
l am happy, contented
l am deaf and dumb that's why
l got Flavy
l am proud of my Flavy
Whether l was wrong or right...
Flavy always stood by me
She has been a great inspiration
in my life
ln each and every way
l wish her all the best
l am always with you
Thank you
Flavy provided me
the most beautiful dream of my life
Our daughter Annie
We were fortunate to have Annie
in our life
But l wouldn't know if the same
would be true for her
She had to suffer a lot for our sake
She became our voice
She had to struggle hard
l used to take her with me to sell soap
Two for five rupees, two for five rupees
l would scold her
l would tell her to smile
to speak louder
And l kicked her out of the house...
when she was pregnant
But never did she complain
Always kept silent
Forgive me
Thank you
And then God sent Raj for Annie
He came in her life
like Prince Charming
Raj gave her so much happiness,
which we weren't able to
l always hated Raj
l don't know why
Okay
l won't be able to continue
Do you think trees can speak and hear?
Sure they can
The same way l and Flavy communicate
l have talked to trees
l ask them everything
Even today l can hear Mariam's voice
Her songs
Her voice is always with us
The same way Annie will always be
with us
We will feel her in the rays of sun
She would become a bird
and come to see me
Annie lives in my heart
She can never go away
Papa! Doctors say
Annie is in poor condition
They have almost given up on her
Do something, Papa!
l can't live without her
And l know neither can you
Papa, call her back
She is slowly drifting away
Say something
Talk to her. She will come back
to hear your voice
Speak to her!
Papa, please
Papa
Say something
Speak out
She always wanted to hear her name
called out from your lips
Throughout her life
she has been your voice
You will have to bring her back
You will have to!
You'll have to
l cannot live without her
Raj, take a hold of yourself
Call her ''Annie'' once
and she will come back
Papa, bring her back!
Come on
Come, sit her
Annie?
Papa!
Annie, you look very pretty
when you laugh
You look very ugly
