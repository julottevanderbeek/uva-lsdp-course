Like, he needs a solid reason.
Don't you, Erik?
Yeah.
Plenty of reasons to dance.

It's just one big old fact

I got laughed at a lot.
They thought I was weird too.
GLORIA:
Mumble!

Like, you're coal.
I was uncool.

Okay. You know, Erik...

he's gotta learn to stop digging.
Yeah.
RAMON:
Mumble! A little help here.
EMPEROR 1:
We'd never have an egg with you.
EMPEROR 2: Na way.
EMPEROR 3: Na way.
RAMON: Give me one good reason.

- And you're grass.
- Is that guy bothering you?
Na, he's nobody.

- Hey, Mumble.
- Amigo.
Hey. Hey!
- Ramon, get out of there.
- That's Erik's hale.
- Ramon!
- What?
We're having a private conversation
with Erik.
Sc you, tan, are mocked
and misunderstand?
MUMBLE:
Amigo, please.
Don't worry, I can fix it.
Na, nu, nu.
Let me tell something to you.
What's a best friend for if he cannot
bring a daddy and his bay together?
Hello? Where are you?
Hello? Hello? Hello?
There you are.
You know, fluffito, the truth is...
far wild maverick outcasts
like us who cannot be tamed...
this place sucks!
Ramon, you're being ridiculous.
Nat any more.
I am going home to Adelie Land.
Be who you want to be
A haven for heroes.
MUMBLE:
Erik?
Haney, I think he needs to be alone
right now.
We can't leave him by himself
in a hale.
We've gut his back, sir.
Yeah. True that.
There you go.
- Let the hoppers work it cut.
- Quite right.
Okay, came an.
All right. Step away.
MISS VIOLA:
Nothing to see here. Shufflely off-ely.
Sc much for my daddy skills.
RAMON:
Adi√≥s, Emperor Land!
This is one fabulous penguin
you will never laugh at again.
Never!
Hey, Atticus. Snack time.
Erik?
Shh. I think they're snuggled up.
All snazzy.
They're not here.
Babe!
Oh! Boadicea!
Came an, Atticus.
Why you fouling around?
Where are you?
I know you hear me, Atticus.
Gloria? Do you think they could have,
you know, run off?
Outside? By themselves?
Maybe they followed Ramon.
- Baby...
- I know, I know.
But I really ought to check it cut.
I won't be lung.
Mumble, relax.
We will find them and when we do,
you'll find a way to put things right.
You're a good dad.
Yeah.
I'll be back as scan as I can, okay?
Whoa, that was a big one.
I hate it when that happens.
Hey, Will? Is that you?
Of course it's me. Can't you tell?
Na. Nat if we all lack the same.
I don't.
Will, we are krill.
We are meant to lack the same.
Not me, Bill. There's only one of me
in all the world.
I am one in a krillion. Hm.
- Where you going?
- I'm leaving.
I wanna be free, Bill!
There's no such thing as free, Will.
Came an, less thinking, more swarming.
I'm sick of swarming.
We've been swarming all our lives.
It's like you've gut
a mind of your awn.
Tell me, Bill,
what lies beyond the swarm?
- More swarm.
- And then?
- Same more swarm.
- And then?
Will, there's nothing but swarm.
We are a swarm without end.
Everything's gut an end.
See? I end here.
That is not a happy ending.
It stands to reason, Bill...
if I swim against the swarm, I must
eventually reach the end of the world.
Yeah.
RAMON:
Okay. On the count of three.
One, two, three!
Na.
I can do this. I can do this.
Na, you can't.
Yes, I can do this. Na, you can't.
Who's talking to me? You.
Who are you? Me. Who said that?
Now walk it out.
Hey! What's up?
What's this? What's up?
We're coming to Adelie Land.
You aren't. You are without
your parents, this is chicknapping.
New go. Shun, shun!
- But we can't. We're fugitives.
- Huh?
- Fug I-wha... '?
- Fugitives.
- Fleeing Emperor Land.
- Na.
- Na happy feets.
- What?
Na happy feets.
We're rebels
seeking thrills and adventure.
And tasty snacks.
Oh, thank you.
This guy. All right. I want a big fish,
three little anes...
Oh, ah! Same of those tiny crustaceans.
The little ones that go:
Oh. yeah!
- New go.
- But we can't swim. We're way tan fluffy.
- What?
- Fluffy don't float.
But it's too high. I'm a leap-ephebic.
Oh, dude! The water's right there.
Like, right there.
I don't care. It's tan cold
for a hat bland like me.
Atticus, stop!
He's chewing an his flipper!
Okay, okay.
Here's what we are going to do.
We count to three. Push me an two.
But you don't tell me, okay?
ALL:
One, two!
Aah!
What'd you do that far?
Baby penguins. Cute, but ruthless.
Will! Will! What are we
even lacking far?
That's the beauty of it, my friend.
I don't know.
Will, please, came back.
I fear the worst.
I fear the worst tan, Bill...
because fearing the best
is a complete waste of time.
Oh, yeah. There!
Maybe it's a black hale.
They're just myths. Scary talk,
to keep us in the swarm.
Coming out of nowhere,
swallowing everything in its path!
For something that doesn't exist,
it's very impressive.
- Swim! Aah!
- Whoa!
Oh, yes.
It's beautiful.
Uncle Ramon?
RAMON:
Na. Na, nu, nu. Kids...
take me home.
Sc this...

Goodbye, Krill World.
MUMBLE:

That's the mating call
of the Adelie female.
I'm about to be thrown to the ground
and crushed by a thousand chicas.
It's okay, ladies!
The lave god, he's back!
ATTICUS:
Whoa! Ignored by thousands.
RAMON:

'Cause none could match
The guts and grit of Sven.
SVENETTES:
Guts and grit.

They took one look at him
And fell to their knees.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Oh, it's akey-dokey.
Don't keep it inside.
Yeah, it's akey-dokey.
SVENETTES:

Then destiny showed
its kindest face.

Bathed and fluffed
All pleasures bestowed.
They covered me in a
protective robe.

Ramon!
Somebody? Anybody?
Nobody?
Body?
SVEN:
Aw, bitter, twisted, lonely guy.
You must learn to think like Sven.
Why?

I have a chance.
And it's fat!
Carmen, I'm getting serious
stalker vibe.
RAMON:
Carmen.
Her name is Carmen. Oh, Sven.
You're going to be my best friend
and my best man all rolled into one.
Hey, Mumble.
Carmen, wait! Where you going?
Erik!
- Erik!
RAMON: Carmen!
Mumble, Ear-rik is your bay?
Yes, he is. Kids...
we're leaving.
- Uncle Mumble, no fair!
- Came an, all of you.
- Oh, nu. But this place is so much fun.
Erik. Let's go.
- I'm not going back to Emperor Land.
- Don't be silly.
I'm staying here.
What about the folks back home
and haw worried your mother must be?
Ear-rik, it's best to do
what your father's saying.
ERIK:
But I don't belong there.
Oh, fluffy one, I want to tell to you
a secret. Okay?
Sometimes, when you are
a little different...
the world laugh at you, ja?
Yeah.
Think you're funny.
- Painting flippers.
- Mm-hm.
Ja, well, we have a saying
back in Svenland.
Believe in yourself, Ear-rik...
because Sven believe in you.
- Might S.
- Ja?  van?
Will I ever fly?
- Erik, please.
- Mumble, the bay seeks a higher truth.
If you want it, you must will it.
If you will it...
it will be yours.
Now, go.
CROWD:
Aww.
SVEN:
Ciao.
Ciao.
Uh, sun?
Erik...
you know, when things go wrong
running away is not the answer. Okay?
You have to find within yourself
a way to handle it. Okay?
Yeah.
Yeah. And we're all different.
It's part of the jab of life
to find out who you are...
and what you gut.
It may not be dancing or flying...
but when you find it...
it'll be all yours.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Okey-dokey.
Right.
ERIK  Sven
BILL:
Will! Will! Will! What is this?!
WILL:
It's the wave of change!
The world is changing, Bill.
We've gut to get an the ride!
By the mother of Guin. This cannot be.
Whoa. Something somewhere
just tank a big bump.
Yeah.
Sounded awfully close
to Emperor Land.
Came an, guys. Let's pick up the pace.
- This is our moment, Bill.
- Okay.
Adapt or die, my friend.
Adapt? There's no telling
what we might became.
Fine. Be a plankton muncher
all your life.
But that's what we are.
We're herbivores. We eat veggies.
Right. Sc everyone else can eat us.
Well, I am not prepared
to be an the menu any longer.
- Where you going?
- I'm moving up the fund chain.
The fund chain?
WILL: I'm gonna go chew
an something that has a face!
BO: I don't remember this.
MUMBLE: Yeah.
ATTICUS: Well, things always
lack different an the way back.
Guess we'll have to go
all the way around.
- But Emperor Land is straight ahead.
- Yeah.
Sc why not go aver that?
MUMBLE:
Na, nu. This way is better.
BO:
But shortcuts are shorter.
Nat always. Now, came an.
It's not that far.
Guys, stop!
Erik. I said stop!
All right.
All right.
We'll keep going,
but take it nice and slaw.
And what's say we don't lack dawn,
okay?
Atticus, what did I just say?
- Whoa!
- Wow.
BRYAN:
G'day, spurt.
Hi.
- Where you heading?
- Hume.
Oh, yeah? Sc am I.
If you don't mind backing up
a little bit...
we'll just squeeze past.
That's the one thing I can't do, matey:
Back up.
The Beachmaster backs up for nobody.
BO:
Then maybe...
you can move sideways.
BRYAN:
Don't do sideways.
We've came all the way across.
You'll have to go all the way back.
I've gut the kids. It's kind of dangerous.
Of course.
- And we're anxious to get home.
- I see. Fair enough.
But see it my way, spurt.
One day, I'll be protecting my beach...
and some pumped-up mongrel
wants to take it from me.
We're nose-to-nose.
The whale world's watching.
And in the back of me mind,
there's this niggling doubt:
Lance backed up for a penguin.
He'll see it in me eyes...
and I'm gone. Goodbye, ladies.
Hello, lonely beach.
- You with me'?
- Yeah, but...
Then get out of my way.
My mother says,
"Every obstacle is an opportunity."
BRYAN: What?
MUMBLE: Ba. Ba!
Whoa! Unh!
MUMBLE: Hey!
ATTICUS: Ya, dag! You be apologizing...
..or I'm gonna tear you a new nostril.
He didn't mean that.
That's okay.
I didn't mean that.
ERIK: SvenTHINK, SvenTHINK.
- Erik, nu!
BO:
Golly gash!
MUMBLE:
You fat...
mather of all bullies!
Get out of my way!
BRYAN:
Oh, nu.
Erik.
PUP 1: Daddy.
PUP 2: Daddy.
- Where are you, Daddy?
- Where's he gone?
Uh-ah.
PUP 1:
That's not healthy.
Are you okay?
Nat exactly.
PUP 2:
Daddy, what are you doing...
dawn there?
- Get back up here.
Nat sure I can.
There is a way...
but you won't like it.
You want me to back up, don't you?
PUP 1:
Came an, Dad.
You can do it.
We won't think less of you, Daddy.
Well, I suppose technically
it's just reversing.
I guess I could, you know,
just a smidge.
PUP 2:
That's it, Dad.
MUMBLE: That's the spirit.
PUP 1: Yeah.
MUMBLE: Back.
PUP 1: That's it.
In no way does this feel natural.
- Now see if you can turn yourself around.
BRYAN: All right.
MUMBLE:
Use your flippers.
Whoa! Stop!
Dad!
PUP 1: Came an, Daddy.
PUP 2: You can do it.
Oh. jeez!
PUP 1: Daddy!
PUP 2: Daddy!
Daddy!
Can you hear me...
Daddy?!
BRYAN:
Shane? Darren?
Daddy!
BRYAN:
I need youse
ta stay strung.
I know you will,
because you've never let me dawn.
Penguin, you still there?
Yeah. Right here.
Would you see that me bays
get home safe to their mother?
PUP 1:
Daddy. What are you saying?
BRYAN:
Sorry, bays.
They're calling full time
an your old man's career.
- Na, Dad! Na!
- Na, Dad!
Came an. Take a lack around.
Can you see any way cut?
BRYAN:
Yeah. I could grow...
a pair of wings.
Can you move at all?
BRYAN:
I'm stuck, mate.
Okay. Everyone...
back from the edge.
Came an, get back from the edge.
All right. New don't move
till I get back.
ATTICUS:
Where are you going?
Ta see what I can do for their daddy.
What can he do?
He's just an ordinary penguin.
That's one small step for a krill...
ane giant leap
for spineless invertebrates.
Holy mother of krill.
How's your appetite, Bill?
He's a big 'un.
What an earth are you doing?
- I'm stalking.
- You can't...!
- Shh! Shh.
- You can't...
You can't stalk. You're a krill.
We've gut to evolve, Bill.
Evolve? Just like that? It's taken us
millions of years just to get this far.
Watch and learn, Billy-bay.
I'm about to naturally select.
A little chewy.
Keenly aromatic.
You just nibbled an its butt.
Don't let it go to your head.
Oh, goodness.
Onward and upward, my friend.
Fresh delicacies await.
Uh, penguin? Is that you?
Streuth.
Oh, penguin.
WILL: We're going where no krill
has ever gone before!
BILL: Uh-huh.
WILL: We're the stuff of legends, Bill!
BILL:
Yippie-yi-ya-ki-yay.
Haw far to the face?
WILL:
Just ahead!
Hey, you!
Doofus!
Yeah, you. Kelp-sucker.
My mistake.
I thought you were
a ruthless killing machine.
Don't you want a little taste of penguin?
Stand back, Bill. This could get messy.
WILL:
Ha, ha!
He's a fighter! But he'll drop scan.
It's just the death throes!
MUMBLE:
You-hon!
Whoa!
Whoa!
G'day, gorgeous.
I'm sorry.
My mistake.
Dad?
Bays.
Pa. It worked.
SvenTHINK.
Oh, yeah! Did you see the lack
in his eyes? Mortal terror!
You said he was finished.
- I spared his despicable life!
- What?
He'll tell his friends. Spread the fear.
There's a new predator in town! Sching!
You're insane.
Someone's gotta keep their numbers down,
Bill, and we are that someone.
Oh, bay.
We are the champions,  friend.
And we'll keep on
fighting till the end.
Listen to yourself.
Me are the champion

Delusional singing!
Will, it's the first sign of madness.

Yeah, get some ice an it.
You'll be right.

Thank you.
Thanks to you, chief, Beachmaster Bryan

MUMBLE: Came an, guys.
BRYAN:

ATTICUS:
We lost, ain't we'?
BO:
Atticus, we're not last.
- Emperor Land should be right here.
- Yeah.
My instincts are never wrung.
You all are crazy. I know for a fact
the Emperor-hand is one day that way.
Na, that way.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, nu.
PENGUIN 1:

GLORIA:
Mumble! Erik!
ERIK: Mam!

GLORIA:

Gotta be a way to get you cut.
Haney, there are search parties

Don't worry, Daddy!
Today Uncle Mumble

Yeah. But that was a whale lot different!
But you did.

Sorry, Erik. One's faster than two.
MISS VIOLA:
Boadicea, do you have a tail feather'?
Yes, I have a tail feather.
MISS VIOLA:

And always remember the family matte:
Just let rip!
Came an, Uncle Mumble.
We gut some fishing to do.
Sn, what news have you?
Every nook and cranny, every which way,
completely blacked.
There's a lot of talk out there.
- Thinking the unthinkable.
- Yeah.
Noah, they're calling this
the 'Berg of Doom.
Haw will we answer that?
- We lack again.
- We can't just keep...
We go back and we search
a hundred times.
There is no way cut!
A thousand times if we have ta.
There's always a way!
Yeah, that's it, right there.

ERIK: Whoa!
Did you see me? Did you?
Don't ever do that again!
Daddy, I was flying!
- Aw, Erik.
- Really flying!
I flapped my wings super fast
and I went uppity-up!
San, we're penguins.
We can't fly.
But Sven is a penguin.
I don't know what kind of penguin Sven is,
but we are Emperor penguins. We can't...
But if everyone could learn to fly,
Mammy can...
get out of there!
- Hey.
- I don't know if there's a way cut!
Knaw... way cut!
GLORIA:
Hey!
But if there is, it sure as eggs
ain't flying.
If you want it, you must will it!
And if you will it, it will be yours!
Aw, Erik, get real. They're trapped.
They're hungry, afraid.
The last thing anyone...
needs is false hope!
Bays?
Then they'll die.
GLORIA:
Bays...
what's going an with you two?
Just working things cut.
Erik?
We need some mother lave, Ms. G.
He's about to explode!
GLORIA:
Mumble, why don't you go...

He ain't hungry...
Ms. G.
It's okay, Atticus.
I gut it.
' Got it!
Okay, fishing.
GLORIA:
Erik, just let it go.
Erik, calm dawn!
Sweetie, take a step back.
Close your eyes.
Deep breath.
Came an, it's easy.
GLORIA :
Just when you think.
There seems no turnin'
back from here.
That's what turns the
wrongs all right.
ALL: That's when love
Turns nighttime.
That's why you gotta be strong
This night
GLORIA:
Deep breath, take it.
ALL:
That's when love can build.

And that's when love
Turns nighttime into day.
GLORIA:
Only love can build us.

Well, then wake up and tell me:
Is that the swarm or am I dreaming?
You're dreaming.
Wow, haw wonderful.
I wander if they're edible.
BILL:
Aww.
Will, don't you long for the patter
of a thousand tiny little feet?
I, for one, don't have the means
to bring up so many kids.
The birthday presents alane...
BILL: I've already picked out the names.
Phil, Jill, Lill, Gill, Hil, Billy, Lilly, Willy...
- All right.
- Wilma, Willis, Wilbur, Wilhelmina...
I get the picture.
And there's even a Will.
Goad for you.
We could start a little swarm.
WILL:
We're bath males.
We'll adapt.
You adapt, I'll adapt.
I've gut slaughtering to do.
Fine, that's just fine! Off you go then.
Quench your bland lust.
There's plenty more krill in the sea.
Plenty of krill would count themselves
lucky to have me as a partner.
I'm a heck of a wingman!
Will.
Will?
- Hey.
- Hey.
BILL:
You're all the swarm I've gut.
WILL:
Suit yourself. But no hanky-panky.
Are you hurt?
Na, I'm good. I'm okay. It's okay.

They prey only an the weak.
PENGUIN:

Na! We are Emperor penguins!
MISS VIOLA:

Though we stare famine in the face,
we will not yield!
- Ha, ha!
NOAH: Though imprisoned...

Yes, sir. Speak an it, Noah!
NOAH:

Hey, back off!
I'm a Carmen-only facility.
Ramon, it's incredible.
Everybody came.
Except for that guy who stayed,
he had the sniffles.
Oh, nu, he's here.
You're a true friend. Thank you.
I had nothing to do with it.
Well, then, Lovelace,

You gut the wrung penguin.
Hello! Hidy-do-dee-dandy there.

Okay.
Yeah!
SVEN:
Hello!
Heh, hey! You huddled masses.
I bring you fish aplenty
courtesy of me!
Yeah! Give them the real, brother!
Who is this guy?
They call him Sven. He's Sventastic.
Let me revert back to
what I previously said before.
- Ow!
- You're an idiot.
ERIK: And guess what.
- What?
ERIK: He can carry more fish
than any penguin that ever...
existed.
- Ever!
GLORIA: Wow.
And it's all due
to his amazingly large red beak.
GLORIA:
Impressive.
Sven? Sven?
There's someone dawn there
who's very special.
And knowing Gloria, she won't eat...
until everyone else has been fed.
- Aww.
Do you think you could take this
down to her?
Yeah, don't be silly. Where is he?
- Na, she.
- Oh.
MUMBLE:
There, surrounded by the children.
SVEN: That is your spouse? Really?
MUMBLE: Yes.
- Your spouse? Wow.
- Here. The fish.
Oh, nu, nu, Mumbley.
She deserves the very best.
A la carte.
A la me!
BILL:
Sc you want some music?
Nope.
Let's have some music.
A-wake me up before you go-go.
Cause I'm not plannin'
on going solo.
Can you keep it dawn?
Just be quiet!
- Whoa!
- A predator convention?
Oh, nu.
- Why wasn't I invited?
- Will.
WILL: Guys? Guys.
BILL: Will, don't go.
- Get off.
- You'll never survive.
- Please.
- Will? Stop!
I think we should split up.
Oh, well, I mean, if it's personal space
you want, how's that?
Na, nu. I mean, really split up.
But why?
Ah, Bill, this is my life now.
I can change.
Be smaller, invisible.
See? You're gonna be just fine.
I'll see you around, kiddo.
Will? Please. Don't leave me.
WILL: Aah!

SVEN:
Okay, let's take you, you, not you, you.

Wow.
SVEN:

Oh, yeah.
You know, if you are not feeling
a full Svensatian...
I can get you mare.
Na, nu, Sven. I'm sure there are
many others hungrier than me.
Ah. Such a noble.
See you for supper?
Um, I'm kind of busy.
Heh. "Kind of busy."
Oh, you're funny!
Whoa!
She is a hottie!
Haney, are you okay?
Are you sure he's not related to Ramon?
Oh, you're funny!
You shouldn't make fun of someone
just because they're different.
Especially someone
who's came all this way...
ta save us.
- You're right.
- And when Sven teaches everyone to fly...
- It'll be up-uppity-up.
ATTICUS: And out of there.
ERIK: You'll see.
Hey, who turned off the fish?
NESTOR:
Hey, guys! What's happening to the fish?
SVEN:
You-hon!
Fish-y friends!
What is problem?
The bird-eaters!
Svensei! You must fly an the wings
of hope...
and summon them to the aid
of our Emperor brothers!
You know, I would love to,
but I just hurt my tongue.
Na.

Ah. Can you believe this?
WILL:

Huh?

noisy and they're messing with our ice.
BO: Atticus, they're building us
a way out of here.
ATTICUS Oh.
Everybody who said we'd never
get out of here, take a lack!
That's our ice road to freedom.
It won't be long now, bays.

Ha, ha. Bravo, bravo.

Santa Maria La Ni√±a Pinta Pacifica...
Ramon. I can't believe you did this.
Haw could I not?
But dawn here, we're doomed.
A thousand lifetimes up there is nothing

You are my world entire.
You're beautiful.
Only an the outside.
Na!
Why didn't I see this before?
You're really beautiful.
You really think so?
Absolutely.
Ramon, my fallen angel.
You chased me until I caught you.
Ay, Ramon, the earth is moving.
I know. It's amazing.
No, it's moving for real. Move! Move!
Keep going. Don't lack back.
Mumble, that thing's an the edge!
Keep trying!
LOVELACE:

RINALDO: Nat enough.
SVEN:
Uh, Mumbley.

Well, anyway, we were two-time
national champion.
MUMBLE: Oh. Oh, okay.
SVEN: Amateur division, 50...
Um... Lack, could I give it a shat?
Sure, sure. Of course.
Attentions! Attentions

Mumbley's fact is very, very hurt-y.
PENGUIN 1:

Help!
Came an, son. Came an.
Where are we going?
Ta find us a lot more oomph.
Where am I?
Who turned out the lights?
Is this the end?
I should make out my will.
I, Willy Williams,
leave everything to my imagination...
Oh, nu. Imagination,
it's the second sign of madness.
If only I'd listened to Bill.
Oh, Bill. I'm so sorry!
BILL:
That's okay, Will.
You were right. I should have
stayed with the swarm.
Na. You were right.
Oh, great! I'm talking to myself.
You're not mad, Will.
New I'm seeing things.
What's going an inside my head?!
- Will?
- Please, make it stop!
Will!
Ow!
Bill? Is it really you?
Well, there's only one of me in
all the world. You taught me that.
Aw, Bill! What are the chances?
About one in a krillion, Will.
KRILL 1:
Quiet, you two. I'm trying to sleep.
Hey, everyone! It's Will!
KRILL 2:
Wow, it's him!
It's wee Willy Williams!
KRILL 3:
I thought he'd be taller.
He's back! Will's back!
Welcome home, Will.
But haw did you find them?
They found me.
I was an my last nine legs.
I was such a foal, Bill.
Will, you're a legend.
Those days are gone, my friend.
The carnivore is aver.
Na. It's because of you we're all here.
It is?
I told them haw the world really works. Haw
there were predators, haw we had to adapt.
I led them here, under the great ice.
Na one can find us here.
But we're still at the bottom of the fund
chain with no significant purpose.
Well, we all have a purpose.
Yours is to change the world.
What possible difference...
cauld one krill make?
Wait and see, Will. You wait and see.
- What are you lacking at?
- What are you lacking at?
Don't know, but it sure is ugly.
Notice, boys, the witty riposte
as weapon?
Right. Outside, now!
We are outside.
- Came an, then.
- Na...

MUMBLE: Excuse me. Bryan'?
- Huh?
MUMBLE: Dawn here.
Ah, g'day, chief.
What are you doing here?
Bryan, I need a favor. A big one.
For you, champ, anything.
I need you to came to Emperor Land.
Bring as many of your kind as you can.
BRYAN: Why?
- To dance.
You knaw...
Now, why would I wanna do that?
- To free the penguin nation.
- Oh, yeah?
- There's been a catastrophe.
- Right.
The entire population is trapped.
BRYAN: Uh-huh.
MUMBLE: By huge walls of ice and snow.
Hey! Bryan!
Look, I'd love to help you, sport, but
you've come at the worst possible time.
Maybe after winter or something, okay?
Na, that's tan late. Way tan late.
Bryan! You gonna fight or what?
You said you awe me one.
But right now,
I gut problems of me awn.
Everyone's cranky, looking for biff.
The multitudes need me to keep the peace.
If you don't came now,
multitudes will die.
Here we go. You saying it's my fault now?
Whatever's happening to you penguins...
don't blame it on me
I'm nut. But you can help save them.
Listen, fella, you lack after your kind,
and I'll lack after mine.
If I thought like that,
I would have left you in that hale.
That's it, I'm claiming a forfeit.
Get off my beach!
Wayne, new I'm really gonna hurt you.
I saved your life!
And I'm gonna save yours.
Take your furball and fluff off...
..or I'm gonna turn carnivore..
With a craving for penguin.
- But...
- The only "butt" I wanna see is yours...
walking away.
Came an, son.
We're wasting precious time.
There's nothing for us here.
Now, where was I?
- Right here.
- Oh, yeah.
- What are you lacking at?
- What are you?
BRYAN:
I don't know, but it sure is ugly.
ERIK:
Na, Pa. This is so unfair.
After all you have done.
You really deserve better.
BRYAN:
Hm.
The courage.
To be  great.
ELEPHANT SEALS :
Rolling, rolling, rolling.
Rain and wind and weather
Hell-bent for leather.
Wishin' me girl was by me side.
Oh, my goodness.
Mumble.
Hey, I know that guy. That's Bryan.
ELEPHANT SEALS:
Ride 'em in.
MUMBLE:
Okay. This 'berg needs to topple.
Find yourself an elephant seal
and show them the moves.
Penguin, how's a bit of fancy dancing
gonna move that?
With enough oomph,
we can shove enough snow.
Pack it in behind. It'll go.
BRYAN: It's not gonna happen.
That's a whopping pile of 'berg!
Just try it. Hit the beat hard!
And together!
I know haw to hit things hard, okay?
- And I'm telling you...
- Came an.
The impact force of compact ice
under pressure is equiv...
Just give it a go, you big wuss!
Wayne!
- Hello.
- Yeah.
Here we go.
New you're talking, Bryan!
You with me, bays?
Oh. yeah!

You hear that? They're doing it again.
- Doing what?
- This.
Fascinating. What is it?
I have no idea.
Wow! What's it far?
Perhaps it's a momentary relief
from the existential terrors of existence.
- Oh. What?
- It brings out my happy.
Oh, yes, indeed!
Hey, Bryan, what are you doing?
Sometimes you gotta back up
to go forward.
ALL:
Tell me why, tell me why.
Why can't we give ourselves
One more chance?
Why can't we give love
