Glee.
- BECKY: Get out, bitch!
-
KURT: Oh, my God, Star Child.
UNIQUE: My Aunt Felicia always says,
"A tiger can't change his stripes."
Glee.
Hey, um, guys!
Guys... New Directions!
New Directions!
Guys! Hey!
I just ran into Mr. Shue,
and he's gonna be stuck
in his classroom for the
rest of the afternoon
because of some school board
inspection thing,
but he still wanted us to meet so we can
start working on ideas for nationals.
Beyoncé!
This is anarchy! We can't... we can't
all just shout at the same time.
That's better.
I have some ideas already.
I'm thinking
that the music needs
to be really simple,
so we can really highlight
our voices.
No guitars, or
nothing electronic.
We go with
a simple piano arrangement.
Which I could play.
I'm assuming
you're singing lead?
Well, I am a senior,
and this is my last go at it.
We need to win this.
Well, feels like North Korea
up in here.
Okay, forget the piano.
Forget all the music.
We could just do, um, a
cappella, that always works.
Déjà Warblers. Should we wear
matching blazers, too?
Let's take it back...
What was wrong with the guitars?
Nothing, why can't you guys
just stop resisting me
for a second,
and just go with me?
Okay, Blaine Jong-il.
- Yes! Blaine Jong-il
- I am not trying to be bossy.
I am trying to give
the benefit of my experience.
I have won more show choir
competitions than anyone in this room.
: You suck.
A capella is worth a shot.
Let's do it.
- Thank you. - UNIQUE: Then you two can have
fun in your little barbershop couplet
while the rest of us
discuss something good.
Fine. You don't want my help...
...then I am not gonna give it.
Looks like somebody's
man-struating.
I heard that.
Oh, good.
We're all here.
Thank you, Team Pamela Lansbury, for
assembling on such short notice.
Okay, well, I rescheduled
my dialect session,
so what's up with
this emergency text?
What's up is I just booked
our band's debut gig!
Amazing.
Where? When?
This Thursday, 7:30 p.m., at the
Greenwich Village hot-spot Callbacks.
Ooh, NYADA's premier piano bar. Hold
on, isn't that a Broadway hangout?
Well, traditionally, but
I talked to the manager,
and he says that Thursdays are
kind of their dead nights.
So we can go in
and do whatever we want.
No way, we cannot debut there.
That is instant career suicide.
Yeah, Kurt, look,
not to overstep,
but I-I follow a lot of bands
just starting out,
and it's kind of all
about the launch.
You know, getting music critics
out to see you,
and that's a lot easier
with the right venue.
Oh, come on, Callbacks is
a real funky place.
You know, they've got tons of history.
Yeah, but I can't think
of a single band
that started out there.
I mean, it's not like The Bitter
End or the Mercury Lounge, or...
Yeah, and if people
associate that place
with show tunes, nobody's
gonna come out for...
Our covers
of Madonna's greatest hits?
I disagree, Dani.
Oh, so we're back
to the whole Madonna thing?
Yes, it was my first impulse.
Okay, look, guys, I know it's
untraditional, but you have to trust me.
I was there at Callbacks.
I saw it all, a vision
of perfect clarity.
Every seat was occupied.
A quiet hush fell
over the expectant crowd.
As Pamela Lansbury made
their way to the stage,
and the opening notes of Madonna's 1985
single hit "Into the Groove" begin.
And you can dance
For inspiration  Get
into the groove, boy
You've got to prove
your love to me
Yeah  Get up on your feet,
yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what will it be  Music
can be such a revelation
Dancing around
you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if
the rhythm's right
I hope this feeling
never ends tonight
Only when I'm dancing
can I feel this free
At night I lock the doors
where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here
all by myself
Tonight I want to dance
with someone else
Get into the groove, boy  You've
got to prove your love to me
Yeah, get up on your feet
Yeah, step to the beat
Boy, what can it be, yeah  Live
out your fantasy here with me
Just let the music
set you free
Touch my body, move in time
Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine  You've
got to get into the groove, boy
You've got to prove
your love to me
Yeah, get up on your feet  Yeah,
step to the beat  Boy, what will it be
You have to get
into the groove
Boy, you got to prove
your love to me
Get up on your feet  Yeah, step
to the beat  Boy, what will it be
You've got to
get into the groove.
Oh, it's my fiancé.
Talk amongst yourselves.
Hello?
Oh, can I just say
Glee Club sucks!
Mr. Shue asked
for ideas for nationals.
And when I gave some genius ones, everyone
got all mad and started dissing me.
Maybe I came on too strong.
But since when is
that a bad thing?
It's not, but you got to remember, at
McKinley everyone has an equal vote.
And if you come on too aggressively,
they might think you're a control-freak
or a puppet master.
Anyway... I was gonna call you.
Pamela Lansbury booked
its first gig.
And I know you were just here,
but I was hoping you could come
cheer us on in the audience.
So, what do you say...
can I send you the deets?
And a JetBlue voucher?
Uh, of course,
I wouldn't miss it.
Wow, I can't believe anyone
would see me as controlling.
You missed a spot.
I'm doing the best I can, Sue.
You know, the way
you clean these floors
is a perfect metaphor for
the way you ran this school.
You did your best, but your
best just wasn't good enough.
Look, I know you're upset
that the school board is coming
today to evaluate McKinley,
and to determine if I'm worthy to
be instated as full-time principal.
And do you realize in my short
time as acting principal,
test scores have risen 42%.
And my new caning policy has dropped both
absences and tardiness down to zero.
So, the truth is you should be cleaning
floors and I should be running schools.
And if you would like
to continue cleaning floors
and feeding your family,
I suggest you do
everything you can to make sure
this place looks just amazing
for this evaluation.
They're in your office, Coach.
One last question
before we come back
for the official evaluation
later in the week.
Why do you want
to be a principal?
Now, I know everyone wants to wear
the crown, but the fantasy of it
can be quite different
from the reality.
Well, more than anyone I have ever
met, I was born to be in charge.
Test scores are up.
Kids are showing up.
Our sports teams are winning.
Heck, even the Glee Club
is back competing
for the national title of clubs
no one really cares about.
And all of this is happening because
I can finally manifest my vision
without having to clear it
with some fool.
You give me this school,
and in one year
it will be the top school
in the state.
I guarantee it.
I'm a champion, gentlemen.
Let me be your champion.
We'll be back in a week.
But between you and me, barring a
total catastrophe, you have my vote.
You certainly have a lot of
trophies, Principal Sylvester.
Well, Superintendent Harris, you're
new in town, you may not be aware,
but I am the only seven-time
national champion cheerleading coach
in the country.
Hmm, my wife used to watch those
competitions on television.
Mm-hmm. Bugged the crap out of me
if I'm gonna be totally honest.
Mmm.
- We're divorced.
- Oh.
Are you married?
No, no.
I married myself once, but I
don't think it was legal.
Yeah.
We should go out
for a beer sometime.
Oh, are you sure that's
appropriate, Bob?
I don't think anyone would see
a couple of guys going out
for a beer as anything shady.
Besides I'm new in town.
I'd like to find some
great dudes to hang out with.
I-I'll call your office, okay?
I'm lactose intolerant, and
I may have to fart, Coach.
I don't look masculine,
do I, Becky?
You have an allure
that goes beyond gender.
That's what I always say.
I have to admit, while I find his hairline
highly suspicious for a man his age,
that Bob Harris thinks I could star
in the sequel to
honestly, it kind
of bums me out.
Maybe it's your clothes.
You could try on a skirt
every now and then.
No, you don't understand
the era I grew up in.
I became a teacher
almost 30 years ago.
It was 1986.
It was a different time.
Boys, no video games in school.
Who are you supposed to be?
I'm the new cheerleading coach.
Do you bop?
:
Get to class, mates.
I've been trying to sound
like Crocodile Dundee.
Word of advice new Cheerios!
Coach, Sue Sylvester.
Try some pants.
Get to class!
That new cheerleading coach
is one scary dude.
The moment I put that track suit
on, the world bowed before me.
I had one made in every color.
Maybe it's time for a change,
Coach.
Everybody is scared of you now.
It can't hurt
to girl it up a bit.
BRAD:
You're early.
Geez! Oh, Brad! You scared
the crap out of me!
Warn me before you talk!
I'm sorry, man.
I'm having a bad week.
Tell me about it. I can't stop
playing online blackjack.
I owe thousands of dollars
to some very sketchy people.
Why doesn't anyone
listen to me?
I'm in 23 clubs!
I probably would've been prom king if
this school didn't have so many stoners.
And what's wrong with having
a solid game plan?
My house is getting
foreclosed on.
And get this, my fiancé
called me a "Puppet Master!"
Well, if "pulling strings"
means that I encourage people to
reach their fullest potential,
then, hell yeah,
guilty as charged!
Brad, if everyone just wants
me to sit down and shut up...
that's exactly what
I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna be right back here
in the back corner.
Believe me, that'll
send a message...
- loud... - PUPPET TINA:
Blainey Days, wake up!
We're sorry we didn't listen
to you earlier.
Yeah, dawg. Our bad, yo!
I'd love to say something really bitchy
or even downright cruel, but I can't,
because you're clearly the most
talented teenager at this school!
On this planet! Yeah, that's why
we're best friends, even though
I'm straight and you're gay
and I'm blond and you're gay.
May the Force be with you.
Kids, I've got an awesome idea!
This week's lesson is all about the
most inspiring guy we know: Blaine!
Ooh, child,
Unique's got the blues!
And the only way to cure 'em
is to hear Blaine's
smooth-as-a-baby's-butt voice!
Please, Blaine!
Please?
Please?
Yeah, Blaine!
Really?
Well, if you guys insist.
What should I sing?
Oh, I know. Hit it!
Ooh, you make me live  Whatever
this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live
Oh, you're the best friend
that I ever had
I've been with you
such a long time
You're my sunshine,
and I want you to know
That my feelings are
true  I really love you
Oh, you're my best friend.
Ooh, you make me live!
Ooh, I've been
wandering around back to you
Rain or shine,
you stood by me, girl
And I'm happy at home
You're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live  Whenever
this world is cruel to me
I've got you to help
me forgive
Ooh, you make me live now,
honey
And I'm happy
You're my best friend
Oh
Oh, you're my best friend
Ooh, you make me live,
ooh-ooh
Ooh, you're my best
friend  Oh-oh  Oh-oh!
Oh-oh! You make me live!
Blainey Days, Blainey Days,
what's wrong with you?
Yeah, dude, you didn't say
a word the entire class.
Didn't even sing.
You want us to call you
a waaambulance?
'Cause your pity party
is out of control.
Yeah, girl, check yourself
before you wreck yourself!
And again. Five, six, seven, eight.
Go one, two... four.
Six, eight.
Sharper. Two, three,
here it comes.
Make sure we land.
Oh, God, okay, I've seen enough.
Everyone stop.
Look, I'm gonna do
you guys a favor. You suck,
and I can't be bothered
to keep wasting my time.
Hit the showers and get focused.
Please, tomorrow,
we are doing 540s.
Oh, my God, her, too?
All of them, actually.
Jake, hey, uh, listen,
I just wanted to say thanks
for sticking up for me
in Glee Club.
Sometimes I feel like
I'm the only one
that cares about pushing us
so we can nail it, you know?
Yeah, I know, I mean, I'm
getting pretty sick of it, too.
Um, I don't know how else
to say this, but...
there's something's going on
in the choir room.
I don't know if it's haunted or
like a space-time rift happening,
but trust me, do yourself a
favor, sit in the back corner.
It's crazy.
Dance has never been our strong
suit, but I think with Jake's help,
we can really kick it
up a notch. Jake?
What's the point?
I'm sorry?
Seriously, what is the point?
I could choreograph a sick
dance, none of you can keep up.
I mean, half of you can't even
do it and won't even try. Why?
Because you're not dancers.
So let's not waste my time.
Let's just do another cut-and-paste dance
routine that even Tina can pick up.
You are such a conceited jerk.
I'm not conceited, I'm bored.
Please, we've seen
your dance moves.
They're fine, not epic.
Oh, you want to see epic?
Give me a beat!
Sittin' in the movie show
thinking nasty thoughts
Uh! Uh!
Better be a gentleman
or you'll turn me off, uh, huh
That's right,
and let me tell it
Nasty, nasty boys
don't mean a thing, uh, huh
Oh, you nasty boys  Nasty, nasty
boys, don't ever change, huh
Oh, you nasty boys  I
don't like no nasty girl
I don't like nasty food,
uh, huh
Ooh, yeah
The only nasty thing I like
is a nasty groove, uh!
Will this one do?
Uh-huh, I know, sing  I'm not a
prude, I just want some respect
That's right  So close the door if
you want me to respond, ooh, yeah
'Cause privacy
is my middle name
My last name is control  No,
my first name ain't "baby"
It's Janet... Ms. Jackson
if you're nasty
People of the world today  Are we
looking for a better way of life?
Say! We are a part
of the rhythm nation
Rhythm!
People of the world unite
Strength in numbers,
we can get it right, one time
Sing on  We are a part
of the rhythm nation
Everybody!
Nasty, nasty boys
Don't mean a thing
We are a part
of the rhythm nation
Everybody sing it  Nasty,
nasty boys don't ever change
We are a part
of the rhythm nation
Rhythm...  We are a part
of the rhythm nation
Sing it
It goes to hear the rhythm
We are a part of the rhythm
nation
Oh, you nasty boys.
Baby-faced mocha-teen boy,
arise!
Where is everyone?
They left minutes ago,
muttering hateful comments
about your snide, nasty
mouth and bad boy attitudes.
Now clear out!
Excuse me, Miss Alfano.
As much as I've really enjoyed learning
about yarn these past three months,
I was wondering, since Arts and
Crafts is my senior elective,
if maybe I could do my own
thing and venture into felt
and fabric and even
yarn and make a puppet?
Your request surely begs
the question,
"Why on earth would an 18-year-old
man want to make a puppet?"
Well... it's not just any puppet...
It's a puppet of my fiancé.
We're 600 miles apart, and even though
I get to see him tomorrow night,
I'd really like
to see him right now,
even though it might be
only in my imagination.
Fine. Make a puppet.
May I experiment with découpage?
No.
I forgave myself
a long time ago.
I think it's time
I forgive you now.
You are right.
Please forgive me.
In this argument, I don't have
a leg to stand on.
Hey, Principal... uh, Coach.
Um, geez, are you okay?
Oh, what's with the shoes?
Man, you have big feet.
Well, I'm sorry if my femininity
threatens you. What is that?
Did you just touch me
with a puppet?
Oh, I made it in Crafts class.
Get that thing out of here!
I don't ever want
to see that thing
in my hallway again! What?
You can't just ban puppets.
Are you saying that
because of the shoes?
Are you less afraid of me?
In a few days' time
I am going to be evaluated
on my abilities
to run this school.
If the school board comes here
and sees schizophrenic students
clearly off their meds
talking to puppets,
they are gonna think I don't
have a handle on things.
Well... Hey, hey! Kurt puppet!
This is contraband. And if
I catch you with your hand
up the butt of anything that isn't
human, you're in a world of trouble.
But... Be careful.
Damn it!
Sue, I... look,
I-I'm trying to work.
Do you mind coming back in,
like, an hour to barge in here
- without knocking and start insulting
me for no reason? - Oh, sure, sure, pal.
I just, uh, I want to ask
you a question first.
Um... you're an oddly
feminine man.
What?
Oh, please, you just
literally did a pirouette.
Sue, just because a guy can dance
doesn't make him effeminate.
That's what I'm saying.
When you dance, somehow
you're able to maintain
your manliness.
Here's the thing:
Um... I happen to have a sizeable crush
on the handsomest man in the universe,
Superintendent Bob Harris.
I've had multiple
conversations with him.
In fact, several days ago, I was quite
certain he was flirting with me.
But it turns out all this
time he thought I was a man.
I blame the Johnny Cash song,
"A Boy Named Sue."
You know what they used
to say about Ginger Rogers?
No.
That she could lead her partner while
dancing backwards in high heels.
I have no idea how that is
germane to this conversation.
Ginger Rogers was
the pinnacle of femininity.
I mean, she was one of the most
famous dancers in the world,
and her partner was Fred Astaire, maybe
the greatest dancer of all time.
Again, I don't know how this
pertains to what I'm talking about.
The point is, Ginger Rogers did
everything Fred Astaire did...
only she did it backwards
and in high heels.
I mean, she managed to find a
way to be feminine and strong.
Half the time when it looked like
Fred Astaire was leading her?
She was leading him.
Okay.
Tell you what.
Let's make a deal.
I'll teach you to lead while
dancing backwards in high heels,
and you give me the $600 I need
for new costumes at nationals.
Nope.
Forget it.
I'm sorry, there's no way
in hell I'm going to give
the Glee Club more
money for costumes
until you can explain
to me how you paid for
that 18-cubic-foot inflatable Lady Gaga
airbag that you strapped onto the back
of the crippled
kid's wheelchair.
That was at least
$1,000 right there, William.
Fine.
Suit yourself.
Hey, doll.
What do you say
you and I cut a rug?
Heaven  I'm in heaven  And my heart
beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find  The happiness
I seek  When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek
Heaven  I'm in heaven  And the cares
that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish  Like a
gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek
Oh, I love to climb
a mountain
And to reach
the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me
half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh, I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it
half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
And I seem to find  The happiness
I seek  When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek.
BECKY:
Wake up!
I've got to shop for
a mini-fridge for college!
Oh, God, let it go.
I don't want a girlfriend.
Shut up.
I don't want to be
your girlfriend, either.
Then what?
I'm late for class.
I'm pregnant.
With your baby.
Bree, this is... All I'm
going to ask is that
you come with me
to the doctor, okay?
Wh-What are your parents
going to say?
No... parents.
This is staying between us.
Forever.
It's the right thing to do.
Right?
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Miss Sally Field
in
Did you really think I was
too stupid to suspect
that you would come back here
under the cloak of darkness
to claim your monstrous puppet-bride,
you strange, tiny, doe-eyed pervert?
Kindly remove your fist
from Puppet Hummel's butt
and place him gingerly
on the desk.
And now report to detention
for the rest of the week.
But I was supposed to fly to New
York to see Kurt's first big show.
Well, then you're gonna have to
cancel Wonder Woman's invisible jet,
or whatever magic discount
bullet train you kids use for
your weekly jaunts to New York.
Now, get out of here.
Go feel shame.
Hi. Hey. Did you get your ticket
that I reserved for you, house-left?
Kurt, I was gonna call you.
Um, please don't be mad, but...
I'm not in New York, I'm in Lima.
A-Are you kidding? What happened?
Did you miss your flight?
- A-Are you okay?
- I-I'm fine.
- I'm just, um...
- I'm just trying to explain.
Yes, why don't you explain... and
it better be a good explanation.
Well, Principal Sylvester
gave me detention,
and she said if I tried to skip
it that she was gonna suspend me
and put it on my permanent record.
Hang on.
Whoa, whoa, wait one second.
And you weren't
going to call me?
I-I was trying my best
not to hurt you.
All I did was steal back
the Kurt puppet
- that I made in crafts class.
- Excuse me?
The-the what puppet? What the
hell are you talking about?
Uh, I-I know, it's, uh, it's kind of...
a weird story.
But basically,
I was missing you.
And is that how you see me?
As a thing of felt and cloth and
button eyes that has no feelings,
that you can play with and manipulate
and then discard whenever you're bored?
- Oh, no.
- I'm a person, Blaine.
I am flesh and blood and bone, and
this is a really big night for me,
and I needed you to be here.
Kurt...
RACHEL:
Hey.
We can release Blaine's seat.
I don't think that's
gonna be necessary.
One person?
RACHEL: And he thinks Angela
Lansbury's performing.
I told you so.
Let's be real for a second.
I've never been all that
nice to you, and I don't
really get whatever's...
going on with you,
but I have to say, there's a part
of me that really admires it.
When a woman of my stature needs a
makeover, she rings up all her best gays,
but unfortunately, Porcelain, the
Sassy Toothless Elf, is in New York.
So... God's most fabulous
mistake, I turn to you.
I want to look more like a lady.
Girl, I have already pulled out my
makeup kit... I got you, boo.
Welcome, teen delinquents, to
detention, AKA "The Beck-fast Club,"
named after Miss Becky Jackson,
who has been here
more than any other
Yeah, why is that?
'Cause I like saying
bad words,
Jacob X. Puckerman, you were
caught red-handed starting another
exciting yet forbidden fistfight in the
William McKinley High School hallways.
Why are you such
a mysterious musical bad boy?
It is now 4:01.
You have exactly eight hours
to ponder the horrific
error of your pubescent ways.
There will be no talking and no
monkeyshines, is that clear?
Crystal.
You know, maybe
we could use this time
to get to know each other
a little better.
We could sit in a circle on
the floor and tell each other
about our core wounds.
Or you shut your hole.
I'm going to college soon, I don't
have time for your lame-ass bull crap.
I'm sorry, Blaine Warbler.
But that was totally
inappropriate.
Please come sit with me.
Sometimes I fly off the handle.
Like yesterday, when I taped
Dottie's buns together.
I did it for my old man.
I wanted him to think
I was cool.
That's really heavy, Becky.
Thanks for sharing.
What's going on with
Blaine?
Well, to tell the truth, guys, I
feel really, really guilty about
missing Kurt's show in New York.
Why? It's a stupid
cover band.
And, dude, you go to New York all the
time... you were just there last week.
True. But Kurt needs me.
- We all need you, because
you are so awesome. - Yeah,
you're America's gay sweetheart.
Thanks, guys.
You guys are, like,
my only real friends.
But we're not real;
we're puppets.
Maybe that's a bad thing.
Maybe the fact that I can
only really feel like myself
with friends I can
totally control is keeping me
from really feeling like
I'm close to anyone.
it's indicative
of a deeper intimacy issue.
Or  everyone
should just wise up
and start doing everything you se, because
you are so right on all the time.
By the way, did
you notice you're
now having puppet fantasies
outside the choir room?
That's not normal.
Seriously, you might
want to get a CAT scan.
Hello, hello.
Wake up. Hey.
Will you cover for me, please?
I've got to leave early.
Uh, y-yeah, sure. Why?
It's not important. Later.
Hey, so, are you ready to go?
No need. The crimson tide
is rolling again.
I got my period.
I'm not pregnant.
I guess I was just
late... this month.
Are you serious?
That's awesome news.
Oh, I am so relieved.
relieved?
Why? I was the one who had
to go to the doctor visit.
No, I just mean that I'm
relieved that the whole thing
is over, you know,
for the both of us.
Let me hit you with the blunt
instrument of reality, Puckerman.
You're still you, a douchey playboy
who's gonna spend the rest of his life
dealing with one mess after
another as long as he lives.
One of these days, you are gonna
knock someone up, and I feel bad
for whoever has to have a child
that shares your DNA.
Hey, I'm gonna make
a great father one day.
To who?
Your seven kids
by seven different women?
Not unless you change.
Bree, look, I'm sorry, okay? I know
this whole thing was really scary
- and traumatic... - Just do me a favor
and stay away from me from now on.
You're toxic.
Little known fact?
McKinley saved a bundle on new
lockers by using recycled metal.
These lockers
are actually Kalashnikovs
that were melted down
during the war in Chechnya.
Uh, Principal Sylvester, Yes.
I owe you an apology. I...
I get in "business mode," and I may not
be that observant, so I... Well, I...
might've overlooked
your more... feminine side.
Oh. No worries, Superintendant.
No worries.
Please.
And this... is the choir
room of McKinley's pride and joy,
our national championship glee
club, the New Directions.
Attention, McKinley School Board,
Sue Sylvester has put our children
in grave danger.
There is a gas leak in this room
that is a direct result of Sue
Sylvester's failed leadership!
No, there  a gas leak in
this room, but I fixed it.
And despite the fact that facilities
management is under your jurisdiction,
Janitor Figgins, I found the
problem, I corrected it
and now I'm cutting your pay
in half.
WOMAN: Principal Sylvester,
we've seen enough.
Yours is precisely the type
of leadership this school needs.
The board would like to make you
principal on a permanent basis.
Oh!
Congratulations, Sue.
Oh, thank you so
much, Superintendant.
How about we go out
and celebrate?
Excuse me?
Would you like to go out
on a date with me?
Um... no.
I don't want to do that.
Am I okay?
I mean, is this what it feels
like to be losing your mind?
I'm unraveling.
I feel like Mel Gibson
in
: More like
Mel Gibson in
with your abs and your...
leather.
Wait, what leather?
The leather I was
imagining you in
when I was rubbing vapor cream all
over your smooth... hairless... chest.
:
Tina, I'm engaged.
- Hey, what's going on? - Uh... nothing.
I'm-I'm just, um, cleaning my head out.
Just trying to figure
some stuff out.
Is that supposed to be me?
What?! That's...
that-that's crazy.
She has Asian eyes
and my exact dress.
Total coincidence.
Not everything
is about you, Tina.
What do you want?
I just wanted to let you know
that everybody feels bad.
We spent pretty much the
whole Glee session discussing
how much pressure you're under
with nationals, graduation...
The engagement. You were just trying to
exert some control. And the truth is,
you should have some.
You've earned it.
Sam suggested you should have the lead
on one of the songs at nationals.
So we took a vote
and it was unanimous.
Piano, a capella,
whatever you think is right.
- Thanks, Tina.
- Of course.
So if you're done being
a puppet master,
do you think you could take your
hand out from under my dress?
- Um...
- Yeah.
- Um... - It's okay.
- Sorry about that.
Thanks.
I'm gonna miss having
a Kurt puppet though.
He did anything I said.
:
Anything?
All right, settle down, Puppet Tina.
Okay. I get it. Blainey Days...
Marley. Marley, Marley, please.
Please just
listen. Please.
I miss you.
Every minute of every day.
And I know that I screwed
things up really badly,
and I'm sorry. I know what I lost and
I know that I can't be without you.
I need you. I don't want
to be this jerk anymore,
and you are the only one who can
make me a better person.
A good person.
I'm not here to fix you, Jake.
I know, I know, I know.
That's why I'm here.
To make it right, to make it
better, to make me better.
I'm sorry, but we gave it a try and it...
just wasn't right.
So after all that... you're saying
you don't have any feelings for me?
I think that you're
a good friend and teammate...
Marley... but I just don't
feel the same as you.
Not anymore.
Marley, please.
I got to get to class.
I'll see you later in Glee Club.
Look, I know we don't know why
Kurt called this meeting.
It's probably
to retire the band,
but we can't rub it in and say,
"I told you so."
That would be devastating.
Well, I wouldn't do that, and I'm not gonna
let Kurt disband Pamela Lansbury.
Look, I might not agree
with all of his decisions,
but he is our leader
and he's an artist,
and artists should be allowed
to fail.
KURT:
Who says we failed?
Cronuts, anyone?
RACHEL:
Hi.
Oh, this? No big deal.
Just a little token from the booking
agency of the Williamsburg Music Hall,
which is the location
of our second gig!
What? Are you serious?
- How? - Okay, true, we only had one
audience member at our last show,
but it happened to be the
right audience member
because, not only was he
a devoted Angela Lansbury fan,
but he also liked what he saw,
made a secret bootleg
and passed it along
to his nephew, who works at
the Williamsburg Music Hall. The Williamsburg
Music Hall, which also just happens to be...
One of the hottest venues
in Brooklyn.
Good work, fearless leader.
Well, it wasn't just me. It was...
also a lot of luck and-and you guys.
Because, you know, whether Pamela
Lansbury implodes or explodes,
I really have to thank you guys
for sticking by me.
Uh, package for Kurt Hummel.
Okay.
KURT: Thank you. Thank you.
Oh, it's from Blaine.
He sends a gift to say sorry for missing
the performance the other night.
RACHEL:
That's so nice!
Okay, that is creepy as hell.
Is there one for each of us?
Guys, I just wanted
to apologize to all of you.
I've been a little bit controlling
lately and it's not cool.
I've made some changes though
and I've learned that sometimes
you just need to let go.
Cut the strings, so to speak.
I bet you'll still
be bossy as hell.
Actually, I hope to
be more of a leader,
as opposed to being
just bossy, Kitty.
So to celebrate this new
laissez-faire Blaine,
I've made some felt
peace offerings.
Voila.
- What?
- Whoa!
It has glasses!
I think we look alike.
Dog goes woof  Cat goes meow  Bird
goes tweet  And mouse goes squeak
Cow goes moo  Frog goes croak  And
the elephant goes toot  Ducks say quack
And fish go blub  And the seal
goes ow ow ow  But there's one sound
That no one knows
What does the fox say?
Ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding-ding-ding
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding-ding-ding
Ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding-ding-ding
What the fox say?
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow  Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow
What the fox say?
Hee, hee, hee  A-hee, hee, hee
A-hee, hee, hee  What the fox say?
Ooh...  Ooh...
What does the fox say?
The secret of the fox  Ancient
mystery  Somewhere deep in the woods
I know you're hiding
What is your sound?
Will we ever know?
Will always be a mystery
What do you say?
You're my guardian angel  Hiding
in the woods  What is your sound?
Will we ever know?
I want to
Know, I want to know  I
want to know
