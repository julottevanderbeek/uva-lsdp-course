Simply saying the word aloud
makes me feel powerful.
Even in voice-over,
how I have worshipped her
Sorry, Angie Jolie,
Catherine the Great...
to ever walk the face
of the Earth.
I'm instating a new policy whereby
quite loudly, throughout
the entire school day.
But blasting her delicious
hooks would make it impossible
for the students to concentrate.
Ah, who cares? Madonna
never finished college.
She hopped a cab for
the bright lights
of New York City with
And I think we should encourage
our pupils to do the same.
You say the word,
and I will provide you
a list of the students
I believe should be
rounded up and shipped
off immediately.
I am sorry, Sue.
This is insanity!
What you call insanity,
I call inspiration.
Let me break it down for you.
It's been the biggest
dream of my career
to pay homage to Madonna...
the woman most responsible
for my take-no-prisoners
demeanor, and my subconscious
tendency to always be
desperately looking for
someone named Susan.
And now, my Cheerio Squad this year
finally has the talent to
make that dream come true.
You will not take
that dream from me.
Do you not understand
the blackmail process
and how it works?
Smile.
I have your wife's phone
number on speed dial.
To recap, you will be
playing those Madonna hits
throughout the day at
an earsplitting volume.
Understood?
Santana.
What does your bracelet say?
¶¶W.W.M.D.¶¶
¶¶What would Madonna do?¶¶
Well, the answer to
that question is usually
date a younger man.
So, let's see some
arm candy, girls.
Sorry, freshmen.
You're going to have to start
trolling the middle schools.
And you know why?
'Cause if you want to be
as riveting a performer
as Madonna...
a skill that will nab us Nationals
this year... you're
going to have to start
thinking like her, acting like her.
Also...
ÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â  la Madonna,
I will no longer acknowledge
that any of you have last names.
Becky Jackson.
From now on,
you're just Becky... You know,
it's like Madonna once said,
¶¶I'm tough, I'm ambitious,
and I know what I want.
If that makes me a bitch, okay.¶¶
I'm pretty sure she stole that line
from one Sue Sylvester.
No, really, she stole it from me.
I said it first. Palladium. '87.
- Can I ask you guys something private?
- Yes, you should move to Israel.
It's about dating.
Not that I'm dating anyone.
We all know that Finn and
I are no longer an item,
and for the sake of the team,
I broke up with Jessie.
But let's just say I
was dating someone.
Let's just say, hypothetically,
we went to a Wiggles concert
last Friday night,
and then because my dads
weren't home, we went up to my room
and started making out.
It was erotic and romantic.
And then he said...
We should do it.
- ¶¶It¶¶? Totally.
- Haven't you done it before?
- No. - Have you?
- What do you think?
- It's no big deal.
For a girl, it is.
What if then he got really
crabby and left, and didn't even
take home the Care Bear I
won him playing Skee Ball?
Would you please stop talking?
You're grossing out my baby.
I just want to be ready...
I know I'm getting older,
and these things are going
to happen someday, but
how do I stop a guy from getting
mad at me for saying no?
Just do what I do.
Never say no.
Oh, totally. I mean,
what's the worst that can happen?
- Sorry, Quinn.
- Look, girl, don't ask me.
The last guy I liked was
the mayor of gaytown.
And I can't wait to get a guy
- ...Mad at me for saying no.
- We just have to accept
that guys don't care
about our feelings.
Like, the other day,
I was walking with Artie...
I've thought a lot about it,
and I forgive you
for lying about your stutter.
However, if you're planning
on getting all up on this,
I'm going to need you
to make some changes.
The goth thing was two years ago,
so maybe lose
the vampire makeup and consider
some tighter-fitting clothing.
You've got the pow, and I
believe you should work it more
if we're going to be an item.
That's got to sting.
Hey, guys. I'm sorry
to interrupt your little sorority,
but I couldn't help but overhearing.
Are you really having
that much boy trouble?
You wouldn't understand,
Mr. Shue. You're a guy.
Well, then maybe you should
talk to someone else about it.
- Like Ms. Pillsbury.
- I tried that.
Oh, um, that's a
hot-button topic, isn't it?
I mean, when to do that.
This is the perfect chat
to have with your mom.
- I have two gay dads.
- Right, right... you...
How about your rabbi?
I really don't feel
comfortable talking about this
with Rabbi Greenberg.
Aren't you a guidance counselor?
The fact is is that women
still earn 70 cents,
to every dollar that a man
does for doing the same job.
That attitude starts
in high school.
I don't know what to say. I mean,
I can't do this job if I don't
have the kids' confidence.
Now, I get that this
area of interest is, uh,
your blind spot, but I want to
help you so that the next time
a girl comes in here asking those
kinds of questions, you'll be prepared.
I'm not saying you need to have sex.
No! No, no, no. No,
that's not what you were offering.
- Just...
- Why would you offer that?
- It wasn't what I was thinking.
- Wishful thinking is all that was.
I mean, what this is
all really about is
teenage girls feeling
like they have no power.
Right, and it makes sense, too.
I mean, look at their
role models, you know? You've got
Britney Spears and her shaved head.
Lindsay Lohan looks like something
out of Lord of the Rings.
Ann Coulter.
Let's work together
to try to find a way
to make them feel more
confident about themselves.
Yeah, I like that.
Yes, we will change the
world one girl at a time.
We'll be like a girl-saving team.
And maybe along the way,
we can find
a way to help you, too.
¶¶Zephyr in the sky

Sloppy freak show babies!
Somewhere in the
English countryside,
in a stately manor home,
Madonna is weeping!
Hit the showers!
Oh, hey, William.
I thought I smelled cookies wafting
from the ovens of the little
elves who live in your hair.
- Wow, Sue. I'm really impressed.
- Yeah, well, Madonna is legend.
And I want my girls to learn
all the lessons she has to offer:
Strength, independence...
Nobody quite like the Material Girl
to empower my Cheerios.
Just like your hairdresser
has empowered you
to look absolutely ridiculous.
- I'll see you later, Sue.
- You think this is hard?
I'm passing a gallstone
as we speak! That's hard!
What comes to mind
when you see that name?
- Genius. Icon.
- Hall of Fame MILF.
So, we're all aware of Madonna's
musical and cultural significance,
which is why this week,
your assignment
is to come up with
a Madonna number.
- Yes! Yes!
- Uh, Mr. Shue?
As a dude, Madonna makes
me kind of uncomfortable.
Yeah, she's smokin' and everything,
but can't some of us
do something else?
Like the guy version of Madonna?
Like, you know, Pantera?
Guys! You know,
it's come to my attention
that many of you
haven't been treating
the young ladies of our
group very nicely lately.
You're disrespectful, bullying,
sexist, and I hate to say it,
misogynistic.
I have no idea what that means.
When I pulled my hamstring,
I went to a misogynist.
What it means is, put yourself
in their shoes for a change.
Culturally, Madonna's
legacy transcends her music,
because by and large,
the subtext of her songs are about
being strong, independent
and-and confident,
no matter what your sex.
But more than anything,
Madonna's musical message
is about equality.
And that is something I think
you guys need to work on.
Mr. Shue, I don't think we can
have an honest conversation
about Ms. Ciccone
without acknowledging
that her images are as
indelible as her songs.
I would like to honor her
contributions by tackling
a multi-media project
- with Mercedes.
- Great.
- Go for it, Kurt.
- I'm still not down.
And no chick intimidates Puckzilla.
I just don't think her music
translates to show choir.
Really? Well I, for one,
couldn't disagree more.
Express Yourself,go.
¶¶'Cause I got something
to say about it,
¶¶You know, you know,
you've got to
¶¶and maybe then you
know your love is real.
¶¶fancy cars that go very fast,
you know,
¶¶What you need is a big,
strong hand
¶¶to lift you to
your higher ground.
¶¶Make you feel like
a queen on a throne
¶¶make him love you till
you can't come down.
¶¶You know, you know,
you've got to
¶¶and maybe then you'll
know your love is real.
¶¶And when you're gone,
he might regret it.
¶¶Think about the
love you once had,
¶¶Hey... ¶¶He'll be back
on his knees, so please
¶¶You know,
you know you've got to
¶¶and maybe then you'll
know your love is real.
¶¶You've got to make
him express himself.
¶¶Put your love to the test.,
¶¶So if you want it right now,
¶¶make him show you how.
¶¶Make him show how he feels.
That's what I'm talking about.
All right.
- I look smokin' hot.
- Guess who I'm dating.
- Who? - Wes Brody.
He's super cute.
He plays soccer with my sister.
- He's seven. - Oh! Crap.
I need a younger, inferior man.
If I don't find one,
Coach Sylvester will kick me
off the Cheerios, for sure.
Hello? Finn!
His birthday's like
three days before yours,
and he's super dumb.
We already tried with Finn,
and he hates us.
Trust me, the way to get a
man to follow you forever...
take his virginity.
Madonna, like,
wrote a song about it.
¶¶You're not convinced that
that is enough...
Hey, Finnocence.
You know, I've been thinking,
and I think we should go out.
Just you and me this time,
no third wheel.
- Will you talk to me this time?
- I don't really talk during.
Look, Finn, It's high
time you lost the big V.
Everything about
you screams virgin.
You're about as sexy
as a Cabbage Patch Kid.
- It's exhausting to look at you.
- Well, look, I appreciate the offer,
but I have feelings
for someone else,
and I'm trying to work
things out with them. So...
Who, Rachel?
She's dating that Jessie
kid from Vocal Adrenaline.
No, she's not.
Please, you can smell it on her.
She's like a cat in heat.
She talked about him
yesterday and practically
- Sprayed the choir room.
- So come on, let's do the deed.
It'll be great for my image,
and Sue will promote
me to head cheerleader.
It's win-win.
Wait, what...
what do I get out of it?
I don't know.
You get to have sex and
make Rachel jealous.
- I meant for me, okay?
- It's win-win for me.
- You wanted to see me? - Sue!
Um... Yeah. Thank you for coming.
Please sit down.
No. Okay.
Um, I was just wondering
why Madonna's playing
everywhere except my office.
Well, it's simple, Arlene.
You don't deserve the
power of Madonna.
You have none of her
self-confidence,
her power over her body
or her sexual magnetism.
Simply put, you have
all the sensuality
of one of those
pandas down at the zoo
who refuse to mate.
I had your, uh,
intercom disconnected.
There you go.
Finn, I was just
coming to find you.
Look, I know that the boys
were a little uncomfortable
about this Madonna assignment,
so I figured you and
I as co-captains
could do a little mash-up
of a bunch of her songs
just to show everyone
how cool it can be.
Yeah, sure, whatever.
Look, are you still
dating that Jessie kid?
- No, no. - Who told you that?
Look, I know things have
been weird between us,
but I never thought
you'd lie to me.
Look, please just
don't tell anyone.
Unbelievable.
We may not be together
the way that Jessie and I are,
but we can still be friends.
I-I'm asking you
as my friend to trust me.
Fine... but if this leads to
something bad for all of us,
don't expect any more
friendship from me.
- Noted.
- All right, let's rehearse, then.
¶¶Something in the way you
love me won't let me be.
¶¶when you make my
love come down.
¶¶I'll hold the lock
and you hold the key.
¶¶I'll give you love if you,
you turn the key.
¶¶Something in your eyes is
making such a fool of me.
¶¶You're making me,
you're making such a fool of me.
¶¶I see you on the street
and you walk on by.
¶¶You're on the street,
I see you when you're walking by.
¶¶you love me till
I just can't see.
¶¶So you choose to
look the other way.
¶¶Well, I've got
something to say.
¶¶I'll hold the lock
and you hold the key.
¶¶I'll give you love if you,
you turn the key.
¶¶Open your heart,
I'll make you love me.
¶¶I'll hold the lock
and you hold the key.
¶¶I'll give you love if you,
you turn the key.
- That was good. - Totally.
- Hey guys, how's the assignment
coming along? - Oh, amazing.
You know how Madonna kind of
reinvented the video, right?
Well, we got Artie and
the A/V Club to help out.
We're gonna make a
Madonna video of our own.
It's going to be Madge-ical.
Madge... you know,
Madonna's nickname?
Okay, you really got to
get up to speed here.
Hey... Schuester!
I heard a juicy little rumor
that your Up With People rejects
were doing some Madonna songs.
Is that true?
Yeah, well, to be honest, Sue,
I got inspired
watching your Cheerios.
Well, I have been waiting
years to pay tribute to her,
and you are not swooping
in at the last minute
to snatch her from my talons.
Madonna belongs to me,
and I will not be copied.
- It's in my contract.
I want you to listen very closely.
You can have your
Barbras and your Chers
and your Christinas...
and wow, I just lost
my train of thought.
You have so much
margarine in your hair.
Okay, first of all,
my kids are doing Madonna.
She's public domain, and there's
nothing you can do about it.
Secondly, enough
with the hair jokes.
Oh, by the way, how's the Florence
Henderson look working out for you?
Oh... ¶¶And you should know I
suffer the same...
Oh, maybe you should try a
new setting on your Flowbee.
Oh, snap!
¶¶Love is a bird,
¶¶she needs to fly.
¶¶Let all the hurt inside
of you die.
¶¶You're frozen
¶¶when your heart's not open...
Who else wants a
piece of this, huh?!
Hey, uh, so, that offer of yours
to lose... the big V...
...I'm in.
- Ms. Sylvester, we'd like a word.
- We saw how upset you got today.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
We saw your face
after Mr. Schuester
insulted your hair.
Close the door. Sit down.
You know, kids, I grew up
with a handi-capable sister.
My parents were
famous Nazi hunters,
- So they weren't around a lot.
- I had to bring her up on my own.
I didn't have a lot
of time or money
to keep up with all
the latest looks.
But on my sixth birthday,
True Blue was released.
An album that would later sell
over 30 million copies.
My sister and I took it upon
ourselves to bleach my hair
with whatever chemicals we
could find around the house.
Ammonia, napalm.
My hair was so damaged,
I've been forced to wear it short
ever since.
It's been a daily, ongoing pain.
Wait, that would make you, like, 30.
And here's the truth:
I mercilessly pick on
Will Schuester's lustrous,
wavy hair
because I'm jealous.
There, I said it.
- I think we can help.
- Mercedes is black. I'm gay.
We make culture. Go on.
We're working
on an exciting new project
and would like to use the Cheerios.
And we can help you
find a new look.
Interesting.

- Sondheim on Music.
- Jessie, is that you?
I'm so glad you came.
I picked the Stephen
Sondheim biography section
for our clandestine meeting place,
because only he would be able
to express my melancholia.
I feel bad about what
happened at your house.
Do you still have my Care Bear?
- Yes. - Since we're
meeting in the shadows,
there's something I wanted
to talk to you about.
Me first.
I was out of line the other night.
You deserve more than that.
You deserve romance...
no, you deserve epic romance.
I feel badly that I pressured
you into... you know,
going all the way.
I'm willing to wait.
You tell me when you're ready.
And I'll make sure that
I'm fastidiously groomed.
- What did you want to tell me?
- I'm ready.
Hey, that catch was
amazing Tuesday.
- Will! Hey. Hey, wait up.
- All right. How's it going?
Good. Um... okay,
I've realized something,
something really important.
You know when we were talking
about Madonna the other day
and how her music was being blasted
like an intimidating cluster bomb
into everybody's
office except for mine
because, apparently,
I lack a shred of sex appeal?
Well, it struck me that the Big Mo
is always in control of everything.
Her life is her own.
Okay.
So I need to take control
of myself and my body,
just like Madonna. Which is why...
I'm planning on doing
the nasty with you
tonight at your place.
Foreplay shall begin at 7:30 sharp.
- So, what do you think?
- Not that it matters.
I couldn't agree more.
- Great. - Great.
- 7:30. - Cool.
Vogue,take one. Sound speed...
and action. And playback.
Strike a pose.
¶¶Look around, everywhere
you turn is heartache,
¶¶it's everywhere that you go.
¶¶Go, go, go, go...
¶¶You try everything
you can to escape
¶¶the pain of life that you know.
¶¶The life that you know...
¶¶When all else fails
and you long to be
¶¶something better
than you are today,
¶¶I know a place where
you can get away,
¶¶it's called a dance floor,
and here's what it's for.
¶¶Let your body
move to the music.
¶¶Move to the music.,
¶¶Hey, hey, hey
¶¶Go with the flow
¶¶You know you can do it
¶¶not just where you
bump and grind it.
¶¶that's where I
feel so beautiful.
¶¶Magical.
¶¶Life's a ball.
¶¶Come on, vogue.
¶¶Vogue.
¶¶Let your body

¶¶Vogue, vogue.
¶¶Vogue, vogue.
¶¶You've got to let your
body move to the music.
¶¶You've got to just...

- Are you ready?
- In a minute.
¶¶I didn't know how lost I was
¶¶until I found you.
¶¶I'd been had.
¶¶I was sad and blue.
¶¶yeah, you made me
feel shiny and new.
¶¶touched for the
very first time.
¶¶When your heart
beats next to mine.
¶¶Gonna give you
all my love, boy.
¶¶I'd been saving it all for you,
¶¶'cause only love can last.
¶¶You're so fine
¶¶and you're mine.
¶¶Make me strong,
¶¶yeah, you make me bold.
¶¶yeah, your love thawed out

¶¶Touched for the

¶¶When you hold me.
When your heart beats.
¶¶When your heart beats.
¶¶When you love me.
¶¶When you love me, baby.
¶¶Oh-oh.
¶¶Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah.
¶¶Oh-oh... yeah.
- Rachel?
- I'm ready.
I wonder which look
she's gonna rock.
Doesn't matter.
They were all fantastic.
- Oh, dear.
- Miss Sylvester.
Oh, hey, there,
Whoopi, Don Knotts.
- What happened?
- Well, I'll tell you what.
All those costumes
and the hairstyles,
I'm gonna leave constant
reinvention to Madonna.
Know why?
Had a revelation.
Here's a list of the kids
I want shipped off to New York
with 35 bucks in their pocket.
Operation Madonna is now complete.
- Sue, these are all Glee kids.
- Yep.
Um... I'm sorry, Sue.
I'm having trouble concentrating.
Your new look is...
- Fantastic. Yeah, I agree.
- Unnecessary.
Sue, you're a powerful woman.
You don't need to copy anyone else.
You're an original,
just like Madonna.
Don't lose that quality.
Do you mean that,
or are you just saying that
because I poked a
couple of kids' eyes out
before second period today?
See, kids, Sue Sylvester realized
she didn't need to reinvent herself.
She needs to reinvent  everybody
else, starting with you two.
- Hey. - Hi.
So how'd your date with
Jessie go Friday night?
It went wonderfully.
Honestly, it wasn't
that big of a deal.
I mean, you know, it-it was great.
But when it was over, I just, uh,
you know, didn't know why
I was so nervous
in the first place.
Just come out so we can talk...
or sing about it.
Look, Jessie,
I really like you, but...
I can't do it.
It wouldn't be right for...
the team.
What does the team
have to do with this?
If I give myself to you
knowing that my teammates
wouldn't approve,
it would be like I was
sleeping with the enemy.
I'd be betraying them.
And because I'm truly
not ready to do this,
- I'd be betraying myself.
- I'm happy for you.
And, uh, what about you?
I heard that you had a date
with Santana on Friday night.
Yeah. I-I couldn't
go through with it.
Why?
I guess I'm just waiting
for the right person.
Do you think they have
room service in this place?
- 'Cause I want a burger.
- I thought I'd feel different after.
Yeah, well, I've noticed that
it takes about 20 or so times
before the feeling of
accomplishment really kicks in.
There's no menu,
so you're gonna have to
take me to a burger joint.
- How do you feel?
- I don't feel anything...
'cause it didn't mean anything.
Where have you been?
I've been calling you all weekend.
I was kind of embarrassed.
I really wanted to go
through with it, Will.
You were so gracious
and gentle and...
handsome, and it felt so good
to be close to you in that way.
I just, I don't know why I
always freak out like that.
Stop, stop-stop-stop.
You don't need to sleep
with me to prove anything.
You took ownership of
your body on Friday
when you told yourself
you weren't ready...
and then ran out of my
apartment with no shoes on.
They're my favorites.
Did you bring them?
I feel bad, Emma.
I've been working so hard
trying to get the guys
to start treating the
girls with more respect,
and I haven't been
walking the walk.
I never should have agreed to
have you come over that night.
- I did kind of throw myself at you.
- That is the point.
We're falling into a pattern here.
We need to instate an official
no-dating policy until
my divorce is final.
Well, when will that be?
I filed today.
So that's a start.
But while we're waiting,
I want you to get some help
for your problems;
we need to take action here.
They're not gonna go
away unless we do.
Now, our health union
covers counseling.
They'll come to the school,
meet you in your office,
whatever you need.
And... I polished them myself.
Thank you.
- Mr. Schuester? - Yes?
I'm Jessie St. James.
Can I talk to you about something?
What the hell?! It seems like
now everybody's doing things
just to hurt my feelings.
I thought you all
would take this news
a little better. I'm a star.
You can learn from me.
We were already fighting
for second leads.
And now that you've shown up,
I've lost all hope at
ever getting a solo.
Yeah, that's right.
And y'all just trot me out
at the end of every number so
I can wail on the last note.
- How is that okay?
- He's a spy, Mr. Shue. I would know.
Whoa, Whoa... guys.
I saw all the paperwork,
I spoke with his parents...
They winter in Bali.
It's a very expensive phone call.
Jessie just moved
in with his uncle,
which is in our school district.
It's all above board, guys.
He goes to this school now.
- But this isn't fair.
- Guys!
Everyone who's ever auditioned
for this group has gotten in.
That's how we do things here.
Okay, to suddenly
change the rules now,
- that would be unfair.
- Brittany.
Mr. Shue, is he your son?
I don't understand why
you're doing this.
Because when you love something,
you got to go for it.
You would never be
with me completely
if I were on the opposing team.
And I care about you more than
winning another national title.
So I left Vocal Adrenaline.
For you.
All right, guys,
we have got a lot of work to do.
Jessie, great to have you here.
- Welcome aboard. Okay, from the top.
- Five, six, seven, eight!
¶¶- Kurt Hummel, take it.
¶¶- Come on, girl.
¶¶I've been waiting for
somebody to pick up my stroll.
¶¶Well, don't waste time,
give me the sign¶¶
¶¶I want somebody to
speed it up for me
¶¶then take it down slow.
¶¶There's enough room for both.
¶¶You just got to show
me where it's at.
¶¶Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go...?
¶¶If you want it,
¶¶you already got it.
¶¶If you've thought it,
it better be what you want.
¶¶We only got four minutes
to save the world.
¶¶- No hesitating.
¶¶- Yeah.
¶¶Grab a boy and grab a girl.
¶¶Time is waiting.
¶¶We only got four minutes
to save the world.
¶¶We only got four minutes,
four minutes.
¶¶Don't be afraid,
hey, Madonna, unh.
¶¶You got to get 'em up, hop.
¶¶Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.
¶¶That's right, keep it up,
keep it up.
¶¶Don't be afraid,
hey, Madonna, unh.
¶¶Tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock.
Sue, what the hell
is going on here?
Oh, what's the matter, buddy?
Did you miss the show?
You probably had to run
to the powder room.
Let me fill you in.
Future center square
Kurt Hummel there
and his brassy hag Mercedes
just tore that Madonna song
- a new one.
- Wait, you two are Cheerios now?
Yeah, I've decided to add vocals
to my already wildly
overproduced Cheerios numbers.
It'll give us the
edge at Nationals.
You guys could've at least
given me the heads-up.
You mean, the same way
you gave us a heads-up
before not giving us a
solo almost every week?
Mr. Shue, Mercedes and I
talked it over,
and we love being in Glee,
but being in the
Cheerios will give us
- more opportunities to shine.
- So we're doing both.
Ah, chipper up, Tiger.
You know, I was down
at the pharmacy today,
and they're having a
monster sale on Dep.
Dep is a hair gel.
And once again, I am making fun of
your incredibly stupid hairdo.
Girls can wear jeans and
cut their hair short,
wear shirts and boots,
'cause it's okay to be a boy.
But for a boy to look
like a girl is degrading,
'cause you think that
being a girl is degrading.
But secretly you'd love to know
what it's like, wouldn't you?
What it feels like for a girl.
¶¶Silky smooth
¶¶lips as sweet as candy,
¶¶Strong inside,
but you don't know it.
¶¶Good little girls,
they never show it.
¶¶When you open up
your mouth to speak
¶¶Do you know
¶¶Do you know
¶¶what it feels
like in this world
¶¶for a girl?
¶¶For a girl?
¶¶what it feels like
in this world?
I am not down with this.
I like being a dude.
That's because it's easy
to be a dude.
Uh, Mr. Shue, I think we're
gonna need a new baritone,
'cause Finn would like
to become Finnessa.
Wait, h-hold on, Puck.
Finn has a point.
I mean, haven't you noticed
how low morale has been
around here lately?
I have.
I think the way I was objectifying Tina
may have sent her over the edge.
- Hey, girl.
- My eyes are up here!
I am a person with feelings!
Get out of my grill!
I am a powerful woman,
and my growing feminism
will cut you in half
like a righteous blade of equality!
We've been treating
the girls like crap...
not caring about their feelings,
not listening, objectifying.
That's the right word,
right, Mr. Shue?
- That's right.
- Objectifying.
As an honorary girl,
I have to agree.
This team shouldn't work,
but it does
because we respect
each other's talent.
And if we want to take it to
the next level, we have to start
respecting each other
as individuals.
Really see each other.
Why were you
singing with us, Mr. Shue?
Because apparently...
I need to learn that lesson.
Fine, but I'm not
singing this song.
We don't have to.
We just have to make it
right with the girls,
show them we get how it feels.
I would get down on
one knee if I could.
Why would you propose to me?
- You don't even like me.
- Stop.
That's where you're wrong.
I was really rude to you.
You're awesome.
And you shouldn't change,
unless you want to.
And if you want to get up on this,
just let me know.
Yep. That's more like it.
Hey.
If you're gonna criticize
and mock me again
- about Jessie, you can can it.
- I wanted to apologize.
The only reason you were even
open to dating Jessie was
because I was such an ass.
Mr. Tough Guy and all that.
I really liked you.
And I could have had you,
but I blew it.
- You really liked me?
- Okay, Finn. I know we have
a big showdown coming,
so let's just decide on the arena.
Sing-off, the parking lot,
- No.
- Welcome to New Directions.
Frankly, I need you.
I'm tired of
carrying the male
vocals all by myself.
I'll do my best to stay
away from your girl.
I appreciate that.
She's a keeper.
Walk with me to the auditorium.
I put together a
new Madonna number;
- I'll talk you through it on the way.
- Sweet.
