Daidokoron
Wait right there!
As long as Yatterman is here,
evil will not prosper in this world!
We will summon light into this world of darkness! We are Yatterman...
Number 1!
Number 2!
At your service!
At your service, koron!
Omochama!
You're totally blocking our shot.
Ah! S-s-sorry, koron!
Yatterwan!
Come out of there, Doronbo!
- Okay!
- Here you go!
Dun dugudun dugudun dugudun!
So it was you guys after all.
You won't get away with this!
Boyacky, Tonzra, get them!
Yes, Mistress!
Take that!
And that!
Oh snap!
I missed!
Kendamagic!
Ow ow ow ow!
That's hot!
Huh?
Kendamagic!
Whoa! Whoa!
Shocking!
Oh! Ah! Shock!!
Electric stick.
Mistress Doronjo!
We lose every week!
Boyayan!
Isn't that great, Boyayan?
Perv!
Oh, Boyayan!
Boyayan!
Get them with this Daidokoron!
Yes, Mistress!
Starting with the right foot!
Hot pot! Tea kettle! Knife! Chopsticks!
Teacup! Frying pan! Pan!
Ow ow ow!
Hang in there! Hang in there!
Yatterwan!
Ladle!
Alright!
Boyacky!
You showed them! You sure are a genius!
Not at all, Mistress Doronjo!
Carrot Missile Attack!
Everyone, say it with me:
Ready, here we go!
Fire!
You can do it, Yatterwan!
He's in trouble, koron!
They got me, woof.
- Are you okay?
- Don't worry.
Yatterwan! I've got a Mecha Bone!
A Mecha Bone, koron!
I don't think so!
Nice catch!
Chef Kandagawa Toshiro Attack!
Alright!
Hurray!
Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!
We've... we've won!
Er, Mistress Doronjo, that's...
The self-destruct button.
No way!
Are you alright?
Ah, geez! That Yatterman!
They never give up!
Maybe we should make a simpler, stronger mecha...
We can't let this get us down!
How frustrating!
About that...
It's all Boyacky's fault!
Not me, Boyacky!
What are you saying, Mistress Doronjo?!
It's a queen's nature to push the blame to someone else.
Just take it. Just take it, Boyayan!
This makes two.
Who's there?
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm a Japanese archaeologist.
That stone is not meant for human hands.
Who are you?
I am a god.
Where is the first stone?
I'll never tell you!
I'll take them both!
So that's the Skull Stone?
My father told me to keep it.
He said he thought he was close to finding the second one, and that he was going to look for it.
But he hasn't come home.
So Doronjo and the others targeted you because of that stone.
What about your mother?
I don't have one.
My mother died right after I was born.
Since then, it's just been my father and me.
By the way,
what's a Skull Stone?
You don't know?
You fought with them even though you didn't know, koron?
What is it?
How embarrassing.
Hey!
Huh?! Everyone knew about it?!
I want to see him!
My father.
I'm all alone...
I'm so lonely.
Will you help me look for my father?
Let's go, woof!
Hey.
When's the next Pikopiko Runrun meeting?
The Pikopiko Runrun meeting is on Tuesday.
- Tuesday?
- Yeah.
Eh? Hey.
It's not here! It disappeared.
Seriously, Tuesday's gone.
Mine's gone, too.
Lucky...
Ladies and gentlemen,

Excuse me, is it really only 100,000 yen?
It really is.
Um, we've both been divorced
once.
Are there age restrictions?
No.
Really?
Is it really true?
You're persistent.
So, you,

Boyayan, this is work, got it? Work!
What do you think?
We're gonna be rolling in cash!
Okay!
- I'll take one!
- Me, too!
Please!
I'll buy! Please!
Thank you, come again!
Alright alright!
Merry Doro, huh?
Could it possibly be possible, koron?
Alright, congratulations! Congratulations!

It's done.
We used all the money we got to build this new mecha.
We call it Virgin Roader.
A creation inspired by the image of Mistress Doronjo as a bride.
Love comes before marriage, you know.
Love...
Yes. Then I, though unworthy, shall take my partner in glorious love...
Come, Boyacky.
If we can't win with this mecha,
I won't let you get away for free.
But of course, Mistress Doronjo!
It will definitely, well, maybe be okay, I think.
Yes.
Yes.
I am Dokurobe, the god of thieves!
Heed my words!
Yes, master!
Have you discovered the locations of the Skull Stones?
Mistress Doronjo.
If all the Skull Stones are collected, a miracle occurs.
If we get them, our dreams can come true.
Dreams come true?
Dreams?
All the high school girls in the country.
All the high school girls in the country.
Dream...
Ma!
Dream?
It's almost time, isn't it?
It'd be great if it's a boy.
Yes.
Skull Stone...
I want it!
Now's not the time for fantasizing!
Yes, master!
The girl you let get away is the daughter of the archaeologist.
She definitely has the first piece.
But for now, for your next mission, you need to hurry to Ogypt.
The third Skull Stone is in Ogypt?
Doronjo.
Yes!
You're beautiful today as well.
I know you can do it.
Yes!
I'm counting on you.
The smoke disappears.
His order remains.
You're really just like a fart.
Well, let's set out for Ogypt!
This is bad, koron!
Ogypt?
When Dr. Kaieda last set out, where did he say he was going?
From a forest in Narway to Ogypt.
Wanna go to Ogypt?
Yes!
Huh?! Wait, Gan!
You want to bring her along?
Time to transform!
Gan!
Time to transform!
Fine.
Yatta!
Yatta!
Yatterwan, let's go!
Shoko, come on!
Mr. Gan!
Off to Ogypt, koron!
You say woof
two three
The sound of a siren
rings out loud
Both sides of the Earth
in one flight
Now he's setting out
Yatterwan
Your ETC Card has been inserted.
In a pose of victory
Yeah! Acho!
Shoot!
Give it to 'em
you've got guts
Attack those
bad guys' mechas
To the ends of the Earth
in one flight
He's at your service
Yatterman
Father!
Spooky, koron.
- Shoko?
- What's wrong?
Is she okay, koron?
Something bit me!
What?
A scorpion.
You jerk!
Where did it sting you?
Here.
Out of the way!
Wait a sec, #1!
Get off!
Okay.
I sucked out all the poison, so you should be fine.
Thank you.
What if my father was stung by a scorpion, and the poison...
Dr. Kaieda isn't dead.
You don't know that!
Why are you so sure?
He can't be dead! Dr. Kaieda is alive.
That's what I believe.
Wow, this is amazing, koron!
Could it be...
A Skull Stone?
We actually found it pretty easily, koron.
What is that?
Thanks for finding it for us.
Doronbo!
We'll take that Skull Stone.
Boyacky! Tonzra! Get them!
Yes, Mistress!
Check this out.
Let me guess.
Kendamagic!
No!
What did you do to Boyayan?!
Take my bouquet bomb!
Amen.
Uncle! Uncle uncle uncle!
We've got it!
You thief!
Yatterwan!
Catch, woof!
Leave this to me, Mistress Doronjo!
I've got something special today!
What is that?
Mistress Doronjo.
I present to you the Virgin Road.
Hoping for your happiness, I made this for you, Mistress Doronjo.
You did?
Wh-who is it?
This took three months of my salary.
You perv!
Now's not the time for that!
Virgin Roader, attack!
Yes, Mistress!
I'm coming!
Yatterwan, we're counting on you!
Let's start off with the Boob Machine Guns!
Ready, here we go!
Yes!
Oh crap!
Look out, koron!
Yatterwan!
Next, it's the Boob Missiles!
Do it!
Mr. Yatterwan!
Yatterwan!
Yatterwan! A Mecha Bone!
It worked!
Here comes this week's surprise mini-mecha!
Oh no.
Ant, ant, ant, ant...
Huh? What are those?
Ant, ant, ant, ant...
Ant!
Ant, ant!
Ant!
Yes!
Yatterwan?
That's hot, that's hot...
Yes!
Boyacky, we're in trouble!
Run away! Escape!
Escape button!
Ready, here we go!
Aahh! I can't push it!
Oh, oh, yes! Yes!
I can't stand it any longer, woof!
Oh, yes!
I'm coming!
Love!
Calm down, Yatterwan!
What do you two think you're doing?!
Mr. Yatterwan!
I'm coming!
Yatterwan...
It's not safe, let's get outta here!
This way, koron!
Wait right there!
Give me the Skull Stone!
This belongs to her.
We won't give it to you!
Mistress Doronjo!
Boyacky!
Boyayan! Hang in there!
Hol- I don't think it's gonna...
I don't think this will work, wait, I don't...
Mistress Doronjo, are you hurt?
What?
He's naked, koron.
Mistress Doronjo, I can't escape like this!
Leave me and save yourself!
What are you saying?!
Boyayan, we can forget about your shame!
We don't care how much we see of you!
You can live.
You can live, Boyayan!
Oh no, oink!
Boyayan!
Live!
How touching, oink!
How touching, oink!
Oink!
Perv!
Oink!
Kendamagic!
Let's go.
My throat is so dry...
Yes, master!
It's water.
What was that sound?
What's this?
What?
Um...
What does a kiss feel like?
It's nothing special.
You only get excited the first time.
Is that so?
You'd know if you did it once.
It's nothing for Taka to kiss someone.
Those jerks...
Yatterman!
Especially #1!
Boyayan.
Hang in there.
Boyayan!
Mistress Doronjo!
Don't just barge in here, you per...
I am Dokurobe!
Heed my words!
I've got more orders for you.
Thank you, Master!
It's almost time for our final battle.
I have information that the final Skull Stone
lies deep within the mountains of the Southern Halps.
You must get it!
And also, Doronjo.
Don't mix love and work.
Love?
It's for your own good.
You have to forget about that man.
Thieves aren't allowed to fall in love?
Boyayan!
Are you going against me, Doronjo?
No.
But...
It's my first love.
Then your punishment will be small.
Doronjo. You belong to me.
You belong to me.
You belong to me.
