The task of cleaning up the
Ganga that we have undertaken...
...is a great religious
undertaking.
But I have come here to warn you
about those political leaders...
...who embark on such
grandiose schemes...
...and misguide the innocent
public for their selfishness.
I have but one request to make.
You must support those
who gave their...
...blood to protect the Ganga.
The fresh stream
flows toward the south.
But, the water in west has
changed its colour and turned salty.
The western culture has
taunted at Rama and Krishna.
Ram, your Ganges has
turned dirty.
No filth can remain
in the flowing water.
And, in such waters the sins of
the whole world get washed out.
So, who can say after
sighting such a Ganges?
Ram, your Ganges has turned dirty.
The one revered the Ganges
and bowed before it.
The one who praised the country
wherein the Ganges flows.
There must be something so as he
came back and is talking about it.
Ram, your Ganges has
turned dirty.
Everybody knows why
the Ganges is filthy.
But I must warn you once again.
Beware of leaders who
appear to be clean...
...but who possess hearts
that are evil.
Brothers, our soul is pure.
But we have gone wrong
in our deeds.
Had it not been so, today we
wouldn't have polluted this Ganges.
The Ganges that we all
undoubtedly revere.
That is why, if we have to
keep this river clean...
...we must first clean its' source.
Hail our leader!
And that source lies within us.
In the dirty politics of today!
We have to destroy the crime,
corruption from our country.
Or else these sinners, these
traitors will wash their sins off...
...in our chaste Ganga
and pollute it!
Brothers, I'll become
your party president...
- I'll keep all these
promises... - He is lying!
Don't get taken in by
this rascal's words!
He is a cheat! A hypocrite!
I will kill him!
I will kill you!
He doesn't deserve to live!
Let go of me!
You can't escape!
Jeeva sir, By wielding a knife...
...I've killed the
ideals of my Gandhian Dad.
I regret that we had to use
you to defame your Dad.
But today everything is fair
in politics and business.
I've done as you said.
Now you keep your word.
Why not? First, let's go home.
Hello. - Here,
Brijkishore sir.
I've got your son free.
I'm grateful. Have a seat.
I'm obliged to you or else
in today's world...
Your patriotism, honesty and
sincerity couldn't bail him out.
Well, as decided now
you must bail me out.
Can one really not live
honestly in today's world?
The honest brigade got martyred.
And the others like
you are starving.
At least let your son,
live in peace.
And look after your old age.
Take these.
Don't you trust my word
that you had to bring money?
I admit you can buy and sell
everything in the world with cash.
But the price of my
ideals is not money!
I won't take this money.
If possible, give my son,
Chander a job.
He will get the job.
The day my mill is opened, your
son will be Chief Engineer.
I'll have his case withdrawn
in no time.
You must withdraw your name
and help Mr. Bhagwat win.
I'm leaving this money for Chander
and his family, not for you.
Long live the Party President!
Come, sir.
- How is Daddy?
The doctor has asked him to
rest but look at him...
He doesn't listen to me.
You must talk to him.
If the leader rests, how
will the country run?
Congratulations, Mr. Bhagwat.
- Welcome Mr. Jeeva.
Congratulations.
Actually this is your victory.
The victory of our unity,
the people.
Long live, Bhagwat Chaudhary!
Long live! - Now you must rest.
Sir, our members want
to throw a party...
...in his honour this evening.
You must grace the occasion.
- Bring Naren too.
Though Radha doesn't say it,
but, that's what she desires.
So you won't attend the party?
I don't like them, father.
Mr. Bhagwat hasn't invited
you especially for your liking!
It's no mean task to be elected
the Party President!
- Problems are solved... - Of
business and work, mother!
Not of life.
Then stay here and solve the
problems of your life!
I don't waste time in
needless arguments!
- Aren't you taking Naren?
- How can I take him along?
His brain is elder to him.
He doesn't understand me and
his talks... nobody understands.
This is the outcome of your
teachings and love.
Yes grandma?
What's wrong with you? Why
don't you obey your father?
Father? Where's my father?
He can't see his son
because of his money.
And the son can't see his
father behind all that money.
For whom is he doing this?
For you... your happiness.
I want peace which I get
from these thoughts.
Grandma, millions born in
this world earn money.
But why can't a Vivekanand
be born?
The day people learn to live
in love and elation...
That will be the day that each
house will sport a Vivekanand!
But that's an awakening which
brings many questions.
And you have to
find the answers.
By going out of the walls of
the house, seeing the world.
By understanding yourself.
Radha must be waiting for you.
Go, my son.
You're so late. I was
feeling so restless!
First meet Daddy. I have
lots to talk about.
- Naren has come.
- Hello. - Welcome.
How are you? - Very fine.
My best wishes.
- What's this? - The book you
wrote in college 25 years ago.
Politics and corruption.
Is this a joke? Couldn't
you find another present?
He only refreshed his memory.
Earlier there was corruption
in politics...
...today it's only corruption!
Congratulations.
Just as you went to a brothel
away from the dirt of the house.
I joined politics to remove
the dirt in it.
Long live Bhagwat Chaudhary!
What is this Professor?
We're presenting this to you
influenced by your speech.
Unveil it.
brought this water from Gangotri.
And this one has just been
brought from Calcutta.
- See the difference?
- To study pollution...
We wish to go to Gangotri.
Please grant us some money
from your personal fund.
Sure. Chamanlal, fulfill
their demands tomorrow.
Daddy is concerned with praise
and they want to collect money.
And I want to say that which I
haven't been able to as yet.
Yes, tell me. What
do you want to say?
I want to know who you see when
you look in the mirror.
Who else but myself?
That's what I want to say. I see
you when I look in the mirror.
I see our friendship not
you in that mirror.
I'll take leave.
When will you understand me?
When will you understand
my heart?
My... factory problem?
Now that's my problem not yours.
I can see its' solution clearly.
Watch where this water takes
your factory and it's problems.
Save Ganga! Save India!
Long live Bhagwat Chaudhary!
According to news we've
received, today Calcutta...
...a man was killed in a feud...
...among factory workers
and demonstrators.
Sahai and Co. Pvt. Ltd. Was
burnt by anti-social elements.
...which has caused damage
of millions of rupees.
Bhagwat Chaudhary has strongly
condemned this dastardly act.
He claims his demonstration
was meant...
...to be peaceful and purposeful.
He demanded a judicial inquiry
be set up to look into this.
This is a miracle.
The old mill got torched before
the new was opened.
And the insurance company
will pay for the loss.
You saved the millions you'd
have to pay the workers being...
...laid off.
And the best thing is that
you'll have buildings...
...worth millions right in
the middle of the city.
Our buildings not mine.
But this sudden protest for
the sullying of the Ganga...?
These are the rules of politics.
The motive behind every loot
and arson should be chaste.
I think I'll pay 10000 bucks to
the families of the martyred.
You are so generous.
Your business is expanding like
the sea, so give the money away.
Your sins will be washed away.
The Ganga will get more dirty.
You are great!
I want to know why you want to
go to Gangotri with those boys.
Grandma, I'm asking you. May
I go for the college tour?
Why don't you answer your Dad?
Why do you want to go?
I want to be free from
this suffocation.
Suffocation? Who is
suffocating you?
From my own and myself.
I've seen why the Ganga
here is so murky.
I want to see it's origin.
There must be something
there that's not here.
If there isn't...
...then what's the point in
worshiping such a river?
Well said!
My beloved Ganga... do
you recall the days...?
When my wagon stopped
by your shores.
Poor Naren is stuck amidst foes.
Why do you want to constrict
his freedom by your bonds?
Whether a bird teaches her
young to fly or not...
He learns on his own for his
freedom. And goes faraway.
You are both full of nonsense!
Let Naren go.
Mother, you're supporting them!
If something happens to him...
Nothing will harm him. It's
my order. He will definitely go.
Grandma! - Go and get ready.
Refusing a young son's
wish is strangling him.
You're taking so many clothes!
Will you stay there long?
Can't say. If someone holds
me back, I may never return.
I've heard the girls from the
mountains trap men in a snap.
- They practice black magic.
- You must learn white magic.
If I did, I wouldn't
let you go so far.
We have a strange friendship.
We never meet when we're close.
Today when you're going away,
I don't like it.
Whether it be planning
of war or a trip...
...leave no stone unturned.
Hello. - God bless you.
Take this Alpine hat.
And here's a suede
jacket. French.
I too have been around but
they were different unions.
Let's see how he looks
on donning them
Sure, wear it.
If you can't snare a catch now,
you won't do it ever in life.
One more gift.
You don't have to develop or
bother about this camera.
Just aim and shoot...
Here's the picture.
Son, come here. - Yes, grandma.
- Yes, grandma? -
Good day grandma.
You are going to Gangotri.
Who knows when I'll leave...
Before I shut my eyes...
Get me Ganga!
Fulfill this wish of mine.
Get me Ganga.
Will you make me cry right here?
How will I return with a smile?
What greenery and beauty!
- Good day Professor.
- Good day.
- Sudden trip this time? -
Didn't you get our cable?
No sir. But we'll
arrange everything.
Grandma!
Grandma!
I've come to take the Ganga
and I'll return with her.
Who is it?
Who are you? I ask...
If you embrace death, how
will you take Ganga home?
- Why? - Take one step
forward and see.
Who are you?
Your life. - My life...?
Life and death don't
come invited.
You were to be saved
so I came by.
But how will you take Ganga
without any introduction?
In this jug.
Tell me truthfully, are
you a man or an angel?
- Why? - Lord Shankar had
trapped Mother Ganga in his locks.
Today you've come to
take me in your jug.
- Where will I take you?
- You just said...
You've come to take Ganga.
I am Ganga.
Yes.
Hurry. We're having
an emergency meeting.
Is your name Naren? - Yes.
We've just found
out the road to...
...Bhairav and Janta Pass is
blocked. Due to heavy rains.
So instead of going to Gangotri,
we'll have to stay here for...
...some days.
Mingle with the locals and
study their customs and traditions.
Postman!
- Where are you running from?
- Tell you later...
You're the only wise
man in this village.
Tell me what Naren means.
Not Naren but Narendra.
He among men who is akin to God.
That is why I wondered
whether the one...
...I met was a man or an angel.
Don't delay me with your angel.
Have to take a cable to the inn.
Some boys are coming
from Calcutta.
The postal service of the
mountains is really strange.
The guests land up and their
message arrives later.
Do you believe in fate?
Why not?
Till yesterday I didn't believe
in fate and destiny.
But now I feel that life
is a game of destiny.
- Or how would I get a new
life today? - New life?
Yes, I'd probably have died
if she hadn't saved me.
I feel this life
is hers not mine.
Whose...?
Who has the innocence of the
innocents on her face.
The freshness of flowers
in her smile.
The sweetness of the
waves in her voice.
And her eyes are as
deep as the Ganga
I've cut lots of wood.
I've made a pile. Did you hear?
Take them to the guest
house tomorrow.
I don't understand why these
folk come at such times to risk...
...their lives
Not all brother, only one
has come to risk his life.
That too, my life.
Who are you? - Your life.
My life...?
You can't take care of yourself.
How will you take me with you?
You...? Where will I take you?
You just said, you've come
to take Ganga... I am Ganga.
My arms call out for you.
And, you would neither
find a Ganga as such.
I'm your life and
I'm your destiny.
And, you'll get salvation
from me, right here.
Indeed, you've to come to me.
And, indeed,
I've to go along with you.
Indeed, you've to come to me.
And, indeed, I've to
go along with you.
What sort of delay is that,
since Ganga is yours?
So, do come. Now, come
over here, O dear.
From the peaks of the mountains.
And, sometimes from
the midst of the trees.
Sometimes with the eyes and
sometimes with these lips.
I've called for you through
all and sundry ways.
The one for whom you've
come searching.
And, the one who has
called out for you.
She below the mountain
and behind the spring.
So, do come. Now, come
over here, O dear.
I've covered myself
with this foggy sheet...
...and I've recoiled
myself in this water.
In the loop of my arms and in
the habitat of the heart.
So, do come. Now, come
over here, O dear.
Come over here, O dear.
Ganga! - Sir?
How did you come here?
First I felt the mountains
were calling out to me.
Then I felt must be some
melodious stream.
But everything culminated
in you.
Were you calling out
to somebody your own?
In the mountains we say...
...call with your heart
and he'll truly come.
But who are you waiting for?
That which is in your heart
but not before you...
He is the one called.
I'm standing before you. When
did I enter your heart?
This is no mountain.
Where the voice resounds back.
The voice of the heart
clashes with the heart.
And then settles there.
Who teaches you these
nice, philosophies?
The school of the
poor is his heart.
Whether it be good or bad, the
heart does what it wants.
Tikam, I've brought
wood. Where should I keep it?
Come... you've brought
so much wood!
Have these put in a corner.
I'm off to the market.
How are you? You
seem very happy.
These foreigners bring
life to this place.
Don't ask, work too increases.
I haven't cooked as yet. Help
me and clean the rooms.
Give me the broom.
Hey, girl!
Did you clean the room? - Yes.
- Give me my watch!
- What watch?
- Wristwatch! - I didn't
find any watch.
First you steal, then
you lie! Come!
Come with me! - Let go!
Let me go sir! I did
not take your watch!
I didn't take it.
I'll call the police right away.
She'll herself admit everything.
Mugger, bitch!
- Sir, I didn't steal!
Please open the door. I
didn't steal anything.
Open the door!
I'll open it and I'll save
you from the police as well.
But you'll have to pay
the cost of the watch.
Sir, open the door!
Anybody there? Sir,
open the door!
- Ganga...? - Sir,
he's locked me in!
He wants to... open the door!
Have you locked up Ganga?
- She stole my watch.
- Are you the warden?
Let her go or I'll beat
you black and blue!
Are you her brother?
What's going on? What are
you watching? Stop them!
I'll show you!
Now where will you escape to?
Stop it!
- Why are you fighting?
- I'll tell you, sir!
- He has locked Ganga and...
- Sir, he's lying!
She stole my watch! Just
wait for a moment.
Sir, ask her whether she
stole my watch or not!
- Did you steal it? - Sir,
we maybe poor...
- But not thieves. - Sir,
here's his watch!
Here's his watch. Last night,
both these men went to the bar.
And his watch fell off.
A child found it.
He gave it to me and
I'm giving it to you.
Is this your watch?
Sir...
Did you witness the honesty
of the mountain people?
You consider yourself educated?
Spreading the filth of the
cities here! Aren't you ashamed?
Let's go!
- Why did you leave? -
It's not their fault?
They are city bred folk.
They'll act according
to what they've learnt.
- But I too am city bred.
- Only in dress.
Not by heart. Else you wouldn't
believe in Ganga.
Why would you fight for me?
It must be the blessing of
some elderly family person.
That's why you worship Ganga.
My grandma's blessings.
She's asked me to get
water from Gangotri.
I would definitely go
had the road been open.
You want to go to Gangotri?
I want to go to keep my faith
and my grandma's love.
I will take you there,
by the mountain path.
Meet me at the first crow of
the cock at the lower mountain.
Okay? Tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow morning...
the first crow...
Sir? Did you stay
here all night?
How did you know? - Obviously.
The cock will now crow.
Careful! Give me the
jug and walk with me.
Strange! Do you practice magic?
In the city you can't even be
sure when the alarm will ring.
And you know about the cocks!
- I can find out much
more. - What?
Walk with me, you
too will find out.
What shall I find out?
The smartness of these city
clothes! What else?
You know where we're going?
Where the Ganga originates
from ice.
Little higher and you'll freeze!
This jacket is from France and
Alpine hat from Switzerland!
Wear it in normal cold
and you'll be roasted.
As for the cold here, it will
stand far and shiver!
Is that so? Let's go far
and see who shivers!
The cold or you!
What's the matter? Now tell
me, who is shivering?
The cold or you?
- I'm not shivering. - then
take off your shoes.
And follow me. - Yes.
Is the water very cold?
Stepping in cold water when
it's cold gives you warmth.
I'm coming!
I'm frozen!
You walk less and fall more.
I know that Ganga will
hold me before I fall.
- Where do I keep my feet?
- On the ground.
The ground has slipped away
from under my feet!
I'm freezing!
I'll freeze to death!
Can't feel my limbs!
Which ones? - Nose and legs!
Legs are all right but I can't
feel if I still have a nose!
It's very much in place.
Can't you feel it?
Now...?
Then it's frozen.
It will get better only
if you shut your eyes.
What did you do?
Touched my feet?
Sir, in this world, people fall
at their mother's feet.
But Ganga first touches
everybody's feet.
Do you know who
serves like this?
The wife.
Who takes you to your destination
when all paths are closed?
Beloved.
And what is she called when
they culminate in one person?
Your Ganga, dear sir.
Dear sir...?
It's so strange. One feels cold
when he goes to this Ganga.
Close to you, one feels warm.
The weather of these mountains.
O, sir, the weather
of these mountains.
It's indeed great as the whole
year has a chilly weather.
This moment is verily pleasant.
So, why should I
dread the chill?
When I've the sizzling
beauty along with me.
This valley is full of
the blooming flowers.
So, who is it that
beatified it overnight?
It seems it's our
marriage in here.
These are indeed flowery words.
As, it's often said
in the mountains.
That, outsiders are
no doubt liars.
O stranger, where did
you come from?
The moment you came; you carved
a niche in my heart.
What should I do as my heart
is seeping out of my eyes?
These are some small streams.
And, I've to swear by touching
the water of these streams.
The streams keep on flowing.
Instead, swear by the mountains...
...who remain in the same place.
The hand is in the hand.
So, the path has passed away
amidst this sweet chat.
This world keeps on singing.
Listen to us; this world
keeps on singing.
That let alone a path;
the whole life passes in love.
That let alone a path;
the whole life passes in love.
It was our perseverance that a
river took the form of Ganga.
And, it's we, who have
seen your two parts.
And, it's we, who're blessed
enough to get your holy milk.
- May I ask you something?
- Yes.
The postman says Ganga
flows even in Calcutta.
Then why did your grandma ask
for its' water from here?
Because she hasn't seen
this pure form of Ganga.
If she would, she'd take
it with her forever.
It's not only about
a pot of water.
But of the faith that
flows with the Ganga.
And lives like a drop
in a woman's heart.
That drop is called love.
Man drowns in its' depth
and becomes a lover.
He lives in Ganga
and belongs to her.
He gives in to her.
Do you understand her so well?
Then take her along.
Take her...
There's a letter from
Manglu in Paharganj.
- What does he say?
- He wishes me.
Our fathers had decided it and
now I'm eligible for marriage.
Ganga too must not be a child.
I'll be taking part
in the ceremony...
...on full moon night
with friends.
Tell Ganga to put the garland in
my neck publicly and marry me.
Our welfare lies in it. Your
brother-in-law, Manglu.
He's making up relations as
if we're already married!
You will be very soon.
Marriages are not
made in heaven.
They are made on earth. And
that's what father wanted.
I've quit a military job
to fulfill his wish.
Didn't get married, wanting
you to settle first.
Where has she gone leaving
the bread on the fire?
I've made my decision.
I want to know yours.
- But what's the occasion?
- Full moon.
We get married without
ceremonies in the mountains.
That's the only day in a year...
...when a woman can
choose her husband.
Regarding what you said,
what happens to Mangru?
- Your Dad chose him for
you. - But I didn't.
My life and my joys...
lie at your feet now.
Will you let me live
by your love?
Are you mad?
Who believes the traditions
of these mountains?
Industrialist Sahai won't
accept a tribal as your bride...
...because of you!
Naren Sahai has to get married
not industrialist Jeeva Sahai!
The man who couldn't give
me the love of a father...
He'll give me a doll of
money instead of love.
Yes, I do care about grandma.
But when she reveres the
river Ganga so much...
Won't she accept
Ganga in person?
Read out what Naren writes.
Respected grandma, my greetings.
I met Ganga in person and she
filled the loneliness in me.
I need your blessings so that
you too can see her pure form.
Rest when we meet. Regards to
elders and love to younger ones.
Your darling, Naren.
As if there's anyone younger
than you! Hides his love!
Let him come. I'll get both
of you tied together.
I'll talk to your father.
- Now write just as I say.
- All right, grandma.
Listen, O sir. The tune of love.
I've chosen you, so you
do choose me as well.
Listen, O sir. The tune of love.
I've chosen you, so you
do choose me as well.
No girl ever takes
the first step.
And, she never comes close if she
isn't helpless by the heart.
There is no limit to my joy as I
intend to spend my life with you.
So, weave the threads of
love along with me.
Listen, O sir.
The tune of love.
I've chosen you, so you do
choose me as well.
If you affirm to it then
the whole thing is set.
And, if you indicate then
I'm ready to come along.
And, if you indicate then
I'm ready to come along.
I'll dance and sing
for you, O sir.
So, give refuge to
me in your heart.
And, I'll turn your house
into a proper refuge.
So, raise an eye at me and
give me the token of love.
The blood of my heart
testifies for me.
Perhaps, my doom is
written at your hands.
I've given my heart to you.
I'm ready to give my
life for you.
So, accept me as it
would be a virtuous deed.
Listen, O sir.
The tune of love.
I've chosen you, so you
do choose me as well.
Listen, O sir.
The tune of love.
Dharma Singh!
I've chosen you, so you do
choose me as well.
Let's go.
Your love adorned me and I
became your bride today.
But will your family accept me?
If they want their son, they
have to accept his wife.
Move out of the way.
Their nuptial night will
be their last one!
You will never reach my
sister and her husband.
I'll hack you and your men
to pieces and burn you up!
Naren will return on the 15th.
We received his telegram this
morning so we came with gifts.
I thought we should consult
Naren once he returns.
Why do you need his opinion? Our
decision is his life's decree.
When things are to happen,
everything falls into place.
Come here, Radha.
Live long. Do you know how
much Naren loves me?
He has written in his cable.
I'm not coming alone.
I'm bringing your Ganga along.
Your Ganga.
I'm taking water.
With my grandma's blessings
I'll come for my bride.
I'll wait for you. Whether
you return or not.
Separation doesn't
break relations.
I'll return soon, very soon.
I've given you all I had.
Your Ganga will live in rags.
I only have one request...
Don't let your Ganga be sullied.
It's time to leave.
Where is Naren?
At least, listen to what
Ganga wants to say.
That, verily those
people came on my path.
The ones who formed such rules.
That, even though life ends,
the promise shouldn't be broken.
I've trust in your promise.
As I indeed know
that you're mine.
So, till you don't come.
My heart will keep on singing.
Do come.
Please come, O sir.
- How are you, mother?
- I'm fine. And you...?
I'm fine. Where's grandma?
- Grandma! Grandma!
- My son has come!
- My grandma! - what
are you doing?
You grandma will fall down.
Who will let you fall
as long as I'm alive?
Bring the jug from my luggage.
Quickly bless me and listen
to some good news.
First won't you ask what
the decorations are for.
That's because I've
returned home.
No. Today you're getting
engaged to Radha.
Engagement?
Mine? - Yes.
At least, listen to what
Ganga wants to say.
That, verily those
people came on my path.
What's the matter?
Nothing...
I want to say something to you.
What's it about? Say
it before everybody.
First you hear it. Then
you tell the others.
God knows what he wants to
quietly tell his grandma...
The ones who formed such rules.
That, even though life ends,
the promise shouldn't be broken.
I too gave my word.
I'd give this water to you
and bring my Ganga here.
Don't do this to me! Please!
She won't bear it!
I've accepted her.
Our union is witness to
it not the sacred fire.
It's a bond of promise
not marriage ceremony.
It can be destroyed not broken.
What have you done...!
- Grandma! Father...!
- What's wrong?
Mother! Quickly call the doctor!
- What happened? - I...
- What happened!
Mother...
I don't understand
what's happened...
Anything can trigger
off a heart attack.
I've given her an injection.
If there's no relief I'll
arrange for a cardiac monitor.
Grandma...
Get well soon... please...
All that I said is a lie.
Consider it a lie...
You had asked me
to bring water...
...from the Ganga for
your last days.
I brought your last breath!
Yes, grandma...?
Not this, silly boy.
Your Ganga...
Bring your bride...
Grandma!
Father! Mother!
Hurry up! - What's wrong?
Something has happened
to grandma! Mother!
What did you tell her?
Nothing. - Nothing...?
Speak the truth! What did you
say that killed my mother?
- I didn't say anything!
- My mother died but...
I won't keep you alive to carry
the family name forward!
What did you tell her?
- Don't beat a grown-up
son! - Move away!
I raised my mother's murderer
in my own house!
What did you tell her?
Since you went out, I knew
something would happen!
You did as you pleased and left
me to bear the consequences!
Answer me!
Stop it, Jeeva.
What has he done? Do you
want to send out 2 pyres?
This family doesn't
need your sympathy
Earlier it was you alone. Now
this family has 2 blots.
Don't be mistaken. Even
I lose my temper.
Will you raise your hand?
Brothel-keeper! Living
off your mistress!
I tolerated you as long
as mother lived.
I'll hack and throw you out!
A brothel-keeper
doesn't die easy.
Tough to kill him.
As for your house...
I never returned to the brothel
where I once spat!
Call me names if I ever
step here again!
Brothel-keeper! But keep one
thing in mind. I don't have a son.
If you harm Naren, I'll turn
your stars upside down!
I've tried Naren's number
But I can't get him Did
he come to college?
No. - Then meet him at home.
I went to his house though
I didn't want to.
He's not ready to meet me.
He sent word that he did
not want to meet anyone.
Sometime he may have said
something to you!
You are good friends.
I don't understand what's wrong.
What can I say?
Post uncle, has
he sent a letter?
No but a letter has
come for Naren Sahai.
When he has already left.
Give it to me. I'll give
it to him when he comes.
But I fear, letters still
reach the mountains.
- He mustn't be late. - Why?
Is something the matter?
Ganga is pregnant.
He must be on his way and
he'll get lots of gifts.
And a child is the greatest
gift which you can give him.
Wherever you'll see for me.
You'll find me over there.
From the way till the caravan.
And, from the
ground till the sky.
It me and me and
none other but me.
Since, you're walking along
with your hand in my hand.
The whole ambience and
all the four directions.
Seem to be along with me.
And, there's no path
that doesn't come to me.
It me and me.
And none other but me.
Wherever you'll see for me.
You'll find me over there.
From the way till the caravan.
And, from the ground
till the sky.
It me and me and
none other but me.
You haven't stepped out of the
house since grandma passed away.
Radha calls up, many friends
came and returned.
What do I answer them?
At least talk to Radha.
- What do I tell her? - How do
I know what's in your heart?
Grandma was right. Sitting
within 4 walls doesn't help.
Neither does pain reduce.
You are right, mother.
I must do something.
I must.
Trust me.
Meet me at Howrah station
at 5 this evening.
Why? - Don't ask me that.
- But... - If possible,
get a thousand bucks too.
Yes, I'll get the cash. Wait
for me at the inquiry counter.
At least tell me where you're
going and when you'll return.
Nobody returns after proceeding
on the path of love.
I too won't return.
I'll speak on social reform
in tomorrow's congregation.
I'll talk to the CM tomorrow.
- What's the matter? - I
want to go out of town.
Sure. Want to go with friends?
- Is Naren too going?
- Nobody is going.
I'll go alone. - What's wrong?
I know I can't give you
time because of my work.
Your marriage is postponed
because of grandma's death.
Go to Darjeeling with Naren.
I'll call and fix everything.
Don't call up, Daddy!
Naren has left!
There's nothing I can't
do for your happiness.
Truthfully tell me where he is.
Now he'll never return! Never!
I've lost Naren!
Now he'll never return!
He will never return!
How can that be possible?
He has never gone to college
without informing us!
How can he leave the city?
He has left and will
never return!
But... where could he have gone?
I'm not worried about
where he has gone.
I'm worried because the daughter
whose happiness is my aim...
...unfortunately loves your son!
I'm worried about how easily...
...I can ruin you if
Naren doesn't return!
There must be something
if Chaudhary says so.
You've pampered him! Did
he say anything to you?
No but maybe he has left
some letter or address.
Listen...
Look at this.
Isn't this the pot in which
Naren bought water for mother?
Yes, it is. But why?
Why are you worried?
Often young men lose
their senses.
Get me the Home Minister.
Naren can't go anywhere now.
Hear this again. A
fair skinned boy.
Height 5 feet 9 inches.
Black bag in hand.
Surround the train so
he doesn't escape.
Don't forget the bathroom.
One ticket to Gangotri.
Which bus?
You can't go further.
Come with me.
- What's my crime? - We
don't nab only criminals.
You have run away from home.
Your protection is
our responsibility.
Don't worry about me.
Let me go, inspector.
If I don't reach in time,
her life will be ruined.
Let me meet her just once.
Then I'll surrender myself.
Trust me.
Son, don't consider this a cell.
Till your family takes you...
...it's my duty to keep
you in this outhouse.
You are under police watch so
don't try to make a run for it.
O companion... O my beloved.
I get my inspiration
to live, from you.
You have given me the
courage and motivation
O beloved, I surrender to you.
All my breaths are
indebted to you.
How will I ever repay it?
O dear... O beloved...
You are the dearest to me.
You are my destination
and my support.
O guest of my heart,
listen to me.
Feels as if the life
is going along with you.
Please come soon.
O dear... O beloved.
I have won the ornament
of your heart.
Difficult for me to
live without you now.
May the tears not fall,
all day and night.
One has to face
separation in love.
O dear... O beloved.
Just do not know, what will
happen tomorrow.
I have offered this virgin
beauty of mine to you.
O guest of the heart,
listen to me.
Feels as if the life is
going along with you.
Please come soon.
O dear... O beloved.
My child!
Where did you go without
telling your mother?
YOU could have told me...
I would if I intended to return.
Now you can't even peer out of
this room without my permission!
All of you listen!
If he gets out of this room...
I'll fire and kill you!
But how long will you
keep him locked?
Till he gets married.
I've lost my son due to
my mother's pampering.
I don't want to lose my
business and power due to your...
...maternal love!
Be patient.
Just a little while.
There...
You've delivered a son.
- Post man... - What
is it? - A son.
Son! Didn't I say my Ganga
would have a son?
I'm a grandfather! I've
got a grandson!
Have some sweet. You too.
Distribute this to the village
and tell them I'm a grandfather!
I've become a grandfather!
I've got a grandson!
Listen, you villagers!
I've got a grandson!
Why are you sad?
I've made all the arrangements
for the wedding.
I've even fixed the
auspicious moment.
Radha's prayers be answered
both of you get married.
My job is done. Come in.
Uncle!
Just because I stopped coming
home you've thrown me out of...
...your heart.
Don't say that uncle. Please.
Your father's door maybe shut
on me but Kunj knows of your...
...every breath.
- I know everything.
- I know that.
There's something
in your silence.
Your heart is talking to mother.
But tell me too. I
won't let you down.
I'll tell you everything.
You'll probably understand
what nobody else does.
Come on.
Come on.
Where is that rascal
taking Naren?
Don't use such words
in a temple.
Naren has come out after so
long and Kunj is no outsider.
- He wants his welfare.
- I know that!
I know what welfare he's up to!
He hasn't sent any word.
Read out the letter
that came for him
If we find his address, I'll
send the good news of his son.
Will you be able to hear
me read out this letter?
Can't the one who had a son
without him listen to a letter?
Dear Naren, love.
Received you letter.
Grandma is elated.
She is convinced only the pure
Ganga can give you new life.
By the time you reach here,
everything would be arranged.
Grandma has fixed your
marriage to me.
I wait for you to return so we
can be tied in a firm bond.
Waiting for you.
Your very own...
He is right.
He's already given me
what he owed my love.
The mother may nurture
the child.
But the seed is the father's
And if he doesn't get his
father's name, he won't forgive me...
...till death!
Even if I don't have a
right on him today...
But he does.
I'll go to Calcutta to
give him his rights.
You'll go to Calcutta?
I'll take you there.
The father bids farewell to
his daughter at the door.
Not to her husband's door.
Only tell me, where is Calcutta.
The place where Ganga
originates is your home.
Where it ends is Calcutta.
Look, neither has the dwarf
touched the moon...
Nor the moon the dwarf.
This is just a passing fancy.
In today's world, does anyone
be faithful to such relations?
Actually nobody has.
But what relation was it that
made you stop going to brothels?
Where lamps were
lit by your name.
What is it here that you made
this brothel your home?
You gave up everything for her.
- Even the caste. -
That was different.
Caste, community can't
erase my destiny.
Don't blame destiny.
The truth is you love her.
A lot of love which your
wife never gave you.
If she understood me, I'd probably
never have gone to brothels.
I was alone so nobody cared,
but you are not alone.
You're stuck between 2 walls.
On one side is your father.
Who thinks your life
is his property.
And there's Bhagwat Chaudhary
on the other side!
Even the government can't fight
his tactics and games.
So what are you? On what
basis will you fight him?
Ganga. With her love.
If I win, I'll get life.
If I lose, I'll be free.
This is in your hands.
Bring my Ganga.
I won't live without
her! I can't!
Bring my Ganga!
You're crying?
All his life, your uncle
could not be a good man.
Maybe he can be Bhagirath
for you.
I'll go and bring your Ganga!
This bus will go to Rishikesh.
Get off and ask anyone
the way to the station.
Buy a ticket and
sit in the train.
I've kept the address and
the photo in this pouch.
Take care.
Sit in the bus.
You had no palanquin.
Take your son to his father
before your bier is carried.
You've sent off your daughter.
Instead of feeling happy,
you're feeling disheartened.
I'm praying that Ganga's son
gets his father's name.
And doesn't die maligned.
Excuse me, where does
the post man live?
I'm the postman but I
don't recognise you.
I'm Naren's uncle.
I've come to take Ganga.
He asked me to meet you.
Like letters to mountains
you too are late.
Ganga has left. - Where?
Yes, she has taken Naren's son...
...and gone to look for
him in Calcutta.
Naren's son! What
are you saying?
Yes sir. Our girls are poor.
Without asking for it, they
give everything to strangers.
Wasn't it better she left
rather than listen to abuse?
- When did she leave?
- By the afternoon bus.
She wouldn't have reached
Rishikesh. I'll catch her on the way.
But how will you recognise her?
Who knows his choice
better than me?
She must be one in a million.
I'll know her all right.
Let's go.
Do you have a girl called Ganga in
your bus? - Well... I wish to know...
Is anyone among
you called Ganga?
Anybody...? - No, none.
- There's nobody sir.
- Thanks a lot.
Sit...
Sir, my baby is starving...
Sister, where's
Calcutta station?
I mean I have to go to Calcutta.
Can you tell me where
the station is?
Are you alone?
It's quite close. I'll
drop you there.
It's growing dark. Come with me.
- Is this your bundle?
- Yes. - Here you are.
Come on.
Come on. Don't be scared.
Has this bus come from
Gangotri? - Yes, this is the one.
- Conductor! - Yes? -
Have you seen Ganga?
- Who hasn't seen it? - I
mean a girl called Ganga.
Little baby, pretty girl,
One in million.
Yes, there was a
girl in the bus.
But I don't know
where she's gone.
I know where she must have
gone! Driver, come on!
- How much did you get?
- Rupees 7 and 10 paise.
Give. Rascals come here to
atone and are ashamed to give alms!
Give!
Go and sit with her!
Wait here. I'll tell
mother and return.
- Mother! - Bitch! It's turned
dark and now you return!
- Will your Pop give accounts?
- Talk softly.
Take... I got 40 bucks today.
Good. Good catch.
- I've got better earnings.
- Where?
Standing outside. Come with me.
Very pretty. Cute girl.
Cute baby too. Is it yours?
- Shop earning? - What
does that mean?
You've got a child and
you don't understand?
Come in, I'll explain.
Careful.
Take a seat.
Give me the bundle. - No...!
Take it in. Take the child.
- No rented child for her.
- Give the child.
Give my bundle. I have
to go to the station!
- Give my bundle! I must
go! - You may go.
First get yourself marked.
What will she get?
- Anybody will pay 30-40.
- I'll pay 50 right away!
Well done! Go with him!
I won't go anywhere! I want
to go to the station!
Don't touch me!
Go with him! Making a fuss!
Let go!
I've paid so I must get
my worth! Come on!
- Save me somebody!
- Paid 2000 for her...
Refuses to sit. What are
you watching? Get her!
No!
Don't be scared.
Who are you?
The cemetery lies at the
shore of the Ganga.
What is Ganga doing
in the cemetery?
Father, I want to spend
the night here.
Even relatives of the deceased
don't stay all night.
Had I not been of a low caste,
I'd have taken you home.
I'll stay here. - As you wish.
You won't be scared?
I fear living humans. Why
should I fear the dead?
This corpse will burn all
night. Warm yourself by it.
It is very cold.
Priest, I want to
go to Calcutta.
- Where is the station?
- I could tell you child.
There's just one problem.
Unless I finish the prayers
I can't talk to anyone.
Come to my house. We'll
leave from there.
Come in. Go and sit on that bed.
I'll show you the way after
I finish my ablutions.
It's not very far off.
Why... did you shut the door?
If it's open, it disturbs
my prayers.
Come.
Let go! Leave my hand!
You were to show me the
path to the station!
Let go!
Let me go!
Child, nothing wrong in it.
Open the door! - Let me go!
- Who is it? - Police!
Open the door.
What was going on?
Yes, you priest? What
were you doing?
Listen...
Hiding here? Get up!
Is that your child? Take it and
come to the police station.
Give your statement about
this rascal over there.
Did this rascal force
you to come home?
No, I went on my own.
Fat lady, why did you tell me
that he took her by force?
How could I bear to see my
husband with another girl?
All right. Hear me carefully.
Next time you do this, I'll
lock you up forever!
You may leave. You too.
You want to go to Calcutta?
Do you have money
for the ticket?
Buy her a ticket to Calcutta
and put her in.
Look sister, nobody
likes me coming home.
Nor is my name attached
to your family.
Yet I feel it's my duty
to at least inform you.
This is destruction! Naren's
Dad will never agree!
If you cancel this marriage,
Chaudhary will put us on the road!
Nobody will give us alms!
That is why let Naren
marry Radha.
I beg you! I fall at your feet!
Save us! Say anything
to assure Naren.
But save us!
Uncle!
Uncle! - Come, Naren...
I got the news and came running!
Come and sit.
Later. First tell
me where is Ganga?
I found nothing about her.
Meaning? - I searched for her.
Made inquiries.
But I didn't find her.
Her brother died so she
left the village one day.
I don't believe this. I don't.
Ganga can't leave
me and go anywhere.
I swear she is not
in the village!
She had already turned crazy
with your memories.
Somebody said she went absolutely
mad when her brother died.
Some even said, maybe
she's no more...
No uncle!
My life can't go away from me
I can believe that Ganga
could be misled.
But she can't be angry with me!
Never! It can never happen!
Stop crying!
Forgive me.
Without fodder even an
animal won't give milk.
Feed the child some water
when a station comes.
This contains water from the
Ganga for my death bed.
I'd give it if it was normal.
My darling... my sweetheart...
...is hungry.
From where the bring the milk...
the breasts are dry.
With tears in my eyes.
How to console him?
If possible, go to sleep, dear.
A station has come.
Feed him some water.
- Where can I get some
water? - There.
This... stop the train!
Stop the train! Stop!
Girl! Don't run!
Leave the bars!
You'll fall with the child!
Both of you will die!
I missed my train!
If you're alive, you
can get anything.
If the station exists many
trains will come by.
What can I tell you?
I lost my family.
His address got stolen!
This was the last resort
to reach him!
- That too deserted me! - But
where do you have to go?
Father, can you take me there?
I'm blind. I may not be
able to see the path.
But I will definitely take
you to your destination.
Take the next right.
You... - I'm not blind.
The glasses...?
To frisk diamonds like you from
the eyes of the sighted.
I have to act blind.
Come along. Don't be scared.
Welcome. Where have you been?
You totally forget us. And
who is this with you?
Manilal has brought a
priceless jewel today.
Hear her voice filled with pain.
It will pierce through
your heart.
Has she learnt singing?
The Goddess Herself
resides in her songs.
Saraswati in her voice,
Urvashi-like face...
Goddess Laxmi will
kiss your feet.
Just learn to dance.
Destiny has made me dance.
I beg you, don't ruin me!
Don't kill my child alive!
Let me leave!
Let me leave!
I will not stay here.
Do you want to leave?
I won't stop you.
But hear this, woman comes to
a brothel when she is ditched.
Go one step down and
you'll find Chakla.
Do you know what that is?
A woman's body is shredded
worse than a mattress.
You might know who fathered
this child.
Even God Himself won't be able...
...to tell you who fathered
your child!
I'll be ruined here too.
I want to take my child
to his father.
But where? How can you find
him without any address?
Outside you'll wander and be
kicked from door to door.
Every man will want
to tear you apart.
And this place is maligned.
No sin is committed here.
No trade of humans.
Only wounded hearts come here.
They leave with some balm.
Manilal says your
voice is magical.
We don't lack in admirers.
Earn some money. Your son won't
get his father's support.
But he'll be supported by
his mother's sacrifice.
Arrange for her stay. I'm
going to the temple.
- Is the room upstairs
vacant? - Yes.
Arrange for her to stay there.
Ganga will stay here.
Father, the way you misled
and brought me here.
Don't show that path to another.
Else people won't ever
trust the blind.
Your Ganga touches your
hermitage and enters the sea.
Why did you push my
Ganga in the sea...
...of death without meeting me?
You only travel from home
to the hermitage.
Mr. Chaudhary is
here to see you.
I'm going to Benares for a
meeting. I'll return in 2-3 days.
Radha has given her list.
Do you want anything from there?
Bring Ganga if you
find her somewhere
I would but unfortunately Ganga
also flows in Calcutta.
Let's go Jeeva. I'll
get him something.
Your belonging.
Your remembrance.
I carry along.
Like a crazy person
O the one who has forgotten me.
Come, at least sometime.
That you Ganga...
...awaits you with
tears in her eyes.
Who is that singing?
Are you joking? She's a novice,
absolutely raw.
We don't want to ruin our name.
If her voice is filled
with such pain...
...what must her face depict?
- Let's meet her.
- Definitely, sir.
Come here.
Sir is calling for you.
But, sir, her education
is still incomplete.
She is learning the arts.
If she commits a blunder in
Chaudhary sir's presence...
Chaudhary's religion
maybe patriotism.
But his real life lies in this.
Why are you risking your life?
Spit your anger in a spittoon.
Ganga will adorn the party
in Chaudhary's honour.
Offer a betel leaf to Chaudhary.
Is she a virgin?
She has a child, sir.
The child of a prostitute
doesn't carry his father's name.
Nobody's child has his father's
name written on his forehead!
Bitch! Do you want to say our
mothers too were whores?
We don't frequent markets
with the sins of our flesh!
But sir you do sit
in the market!
Chamanlal, she has learnt
everything but manners.
Disrobe her before
she disrobes us.
That was Draupadi to save
whom Krishna appeared.
Nobody comes to a whore's aid!
I've gifted my shame
to my Mohan long ago.
Don't act coy under
the garb of clothes!
Scream, yell.
Else people will say Ganga
quietly became nude!
A troubled soul
Says this with tears in her eyes.
O Lord, you Ganga
has been sullied
While washing away the
sins of the sinners.
Had descended on earth...
...with such pious waters.
But perverts,
short tempered ones...
...greedy and ignorant have
taken a dip in it.
It brought with it, waters
which was like pure nectar.
It carried life in its waters,
and supported one and all.
A river and a woman...
...both lead their lives, washing
away the dirt of other.
O Lord, your Ganga
has been sullied.
While washing away the
sins of the sinners.
The soul is the
one which is precious.
While the body is
just a covering.
Don't call the real
one as an illusion.
The covering can become dirty.
No one taunt her.
Rather she is worth worshipping.
She should be called
a Goddess and she should...
...be looked from the
eyes of the soul.
One should guard it.
One should guard this
valuable at all times.
O Lord, your Ganga
has been sullied.
While washing away
the sins of the sinner.
She's definitely
not professional.
This wounded girl has
wounded me today.
You are an admirer, a jeweler.
Tell Tajeshwaribai she can
take any sum from me.
I'll take her to Calcutta.
You will bring her
to my orchard.
What was the need for this? God
has blessed us with everything.
- Radha will reign over
it. - That's true.
I'll fulfill anything
that's left out.
You must. You condemn
dowry for the public.
But it's below the leader's
dignity to follow it.
Why did you call for me?
Don't be so harsh. Instead
help the girl's side.
I haven't seen as
many weddings...
...as many times you've
been married!
You'll arrange the music
for the wedding.
Then I'll have to go to Benares.
Because I belong to the
greatest lineage of Calcutta.
Is it? Then leave today itself.
But be here by that night.
You've landed up here too!
Still wriggling your way into homes
Even if a dog is bad,
he's still loyal.
But you're human!
Welcome.
Take a look.
Did you buy up all Benares?
This is nothing. Half of
Benares is in my orchard.
- What do you mean? - Tomorrow
my daughter will leave.
For whom will I live then?
Thought I'd get something
for myself...
...so what if she has a kid?
She'll entertain you too.
You too must take a look.
Let it be.
He's family. Tomorrow if not
today, you have to do this.
Did you think the same when
you were being nursed?
Why? Aren't you amazed?
I had the same reaction.
I didn't buy her for nothing.
We'll share her.
Let's get the marriage done.
She's the Ganga at home.
We'll take a dip when
we feel like.
Right?
Did you hear that?
Tajeshwaribai said they
don't trade in humans.
Then why did she send me here?
I swear by my son...
Each time I see you,
I curse you!
A woman's curse
can destroy iron.
But you are human. I fear
my curse may ruin you.
Go away from here!
Can't you see where you walk?
- You...? - I was going
to Benares to meet you.
What are you doing here?
And tell me the truth.
Are you going on a hunt
or back from a hunt?
I no longer do that.
Misleading women, I finally
came on the right track.
I've decided never to walk
on this sinful path.
Maybe poor Ganga
might forgive me.
- Which Ganga? - A
poor mountain girl.
She's come from Gangotri.
Wandering with her son.
The child's father
lives in Calcutta.
Don't say another word.
Take me to her!
Do you know what you've done?
The one you brought from
Benares is a fire not a spark!
You are not able to see it but
I can see the destruction.
What are you saying?
Look at this.
This is the same girl for
whom Naren ran away.
How did this happen?
If Naren finds out this girl is
in your house not the hills...
What will be the outcome?
That can never happen.
I'm Kunj, Naren's uncle.
Do you know Naren?
You know him? Take me to him!
Take me to him just once.
I beg you...!
Take me to him once!
I went to your village for you.
I searched for you everywhere
but I couldn't find you.
And now that I've found you...
Luck has changed.
I forced Naren to marry another.
By lying that you're dead.
I died the day I sat
in the market.
I'm carrying my dead body
to give him his son.
Take me to him just once!
Then I'll go away
from here forever!
I can take you to him right now.
But the people who have made
you a prisoner of this city...
...bought you for
their debauchery...
Will they accept you as
the bride of their house?
And till Naren accepts you
in front of the world...
People will call your son names.
All this while you were being
tested. Now it's Ram's turn.
Chaudhary is calling you.
So late in the night?
Is all fine? - Where is Ganga?
- She's inside. Should I call
her? - Listen carefully.
You'll get the train to
Benares in half an hour.
Immediately take her
to Tajeshwaribai.
Take this.
Now if this girl is seen
within Calcutta...
I'll have both of you hacked!
Take her and leave right now.
Understood? Take this.
Let's go.
Got it but the Ganga doesn't
flow backwards.
Ganga has never returned from
Calcutta to Benares nor will she!
I won't get married! At
the most, you'll kill me!
Then kill me! But I
won't get married!
Please leave.
You've made up your mind that
you won't get married.
You want to live for a girl
who is not in this world?
Mother, you...!
I don't know everything but
I know a little about Ganga.
But understand one
thing, my son.
If you don't get married, 2
biers will leave this house.
Your father's and mine!
An old saying comes to mind.
The groom comes for the bride.
The parents to meet each other.
But the guests come for
good music and dance.
I've asked Kunjbihari do organise
this. He must be on his way.
Welcome Kunj.
Everybody is complaining about
you. You're quite late.
I've come early so
it's not too late.
It's Radha's wedding.
I had to find Meera for
this musical night.
Now we'll see whether Mohan...
...is bound by Radha's
marriage flowers.
Or a lost Meera's song.
Radha and Meera...
Both loved Krisha.
But what is the difference
between their love.
One was emotional,
the other devotional.
Radha searched him
in the Madhuban.
But Meera met him
in her inner self.
The Govind whom Radha lost...
Was available to Meera,
whenever she wished.
One side was the flute...
and anklet on the other.
One was a madcap one was wounded.
What was the difference?
One loved the person,
the other his image.
One was emotional,
the other decotioal.
Meera loved him as
Giridhar Nagar, the saviour.
While Radha loved
him as a companion.
Radha decked up
for him, everyday.
While Meera turned
in as ascetic.
One was the queen, another
surrendered just like a maid.
Both craved for Hari's love.
What was the difference
between their contentment?
One never won, another
never gave up.
Your Ganga has been sullied.
Uncle? - Yes, I lied!
But won't you ask why?
Why did your uncle lie?
Ask your mother the reason!
She made me lie.
To stop the destruction
of her home.
...who wanted to ruin
the Sahai family!
- Ruin...? - Sister, tell
him that I'm lying!
Mother...?
But how does that affect you?
You are going to marry Radha.
And your Ganga is a singing
dancing whore!
A woman with no character.
Somebody to be hated!
Home are adorned with things
bought from the market.
- They don't make a home.
- Quiet, uncle!
After hearing this, if you
still wish to have her...
Ask this white garbed Bhagwat
Chaudhary who made her a whore!
Why did he buy her from Benares
and bring her here?
Why did he keep her in his
orchard as his mistress?
Shame on you! You lust for a
girl the age of your daughter!
Radha is your daughter.
How would you feel somebody
treated her so?
Shameless! Curb your tongue!
Don't make the mistake
of raising your hand!
Or I won't maintain the
distance between our age.
The two penny promiscuous
woman...
...for whom you're
ready to beat me.
May I know how she is
related to my dreams?
Would you like to know?
Do you know who she is?
She is my Ganga!
She is the daughter-in-law
of the Sahai family!
Do you think I'll accept any
girl as my daughter-in-law for...
...your sake?
Don't. The one who had to
accept her has done it.
You don't matter.
You scoundrel! It
won't matter to you
You've had your revenge
for that day's fight!
You settled in a whore house
and you want my family too to...
...settle there!
Uncle only settled
in a brothel...
But you took my Ganga to a
brothel instead of home!
Cut the crap, I've seen
many such dramas in my life.
Throw this girl
out of the house!
Stop! - Stop it, Daddy.
Stop it.
You can't snatch another's joys
and make your child happy.
If you'd get adopt a daughter,
I'd worship you all my life.
I'd even accept a step mother
if you needed a companion.
But... you're terrific Daddy!
On one hand you're giving your
daughter away in marriage.
And with the other, you turned a
married woman into a mistress!
Saw the outcome? Your daughter
became a widow without marriage!
Forgive me.
Don't ask any questions. I have
no proof of my honesty.
I'll only ask you
to leave with me.
We're not needed amidst
these reputed families.
We'll build our home where
the Ganga lives.
A singing dancing whore
looks good in brothels.
Not in homes.
I haven't come to
ruin your life.
I haven't come to ask
you for anything.
The aim of my life
is to give you...
Your son. Ganga can bear
thousands of abuses on herself...
But she can't bear to see
anyone point a finger at her son!
Accept this innocent...
My son!
Is this our child?
This is your grandson, father!
The lamp of the Sahai family!
She hasn't brought a stranger.
She came to give me my son.
Stop her! She's gone!
Stop!
Stop!
Shoot her dead!
- Stop, Ganga!
You killed Ganga! You
killed my Ganga!
What are you watching?
Shoot him.
Don't anyone dare
come between us!
Or he too will die with
Bhagwat Chaudhary!
Rascal! Scoundrel! Why
did you kill my Ganga?
Swine! You are polluted
not Ganga!
Men like you are filthy!
Answer me, you worm!
Filthy murderer!
I won't let you live!
It's best you die!
- I'll kill you! - Stop!
I say, stop!
Stop this madness!
Move out father.
Or the world will say a
son killed his father.
Don't do that. Ganga is alive.
I'm taking Ganga and my son
away from here, father.
You can't give us life.
Give us death. Here,
pick up the gun.
Kill us and get rid of
the hatred within you!
Kill us, father! Kill us!
Let's go. We'll go
faraway from here.
You are the ocean.
And Ganga is the flow.
The Ganga is united
with the ocean.
She achieves salvation
when they unite.
Listen to what the Ganga says...
...that such great souls
have come to my shores.
Who believed in principles.
Of laying their lives...
...for their promises.
Our Ganga...
...thus narrates so with
tears in her eyes.
O Lord, your Ganga
has been sullied.
By washing away the
sins of the sinners.
We belong to that rare land.
In which the Ganga flows.
The one who resided
with the sages.
Also resides with the sinners.
No truth in thoughts and deeds.
They soil the Ganga and then
claim to be its saviours.
What can the poor one do?
What can the poor one do,
when she is betrayed by her own
O Lord, your Ganga
has been sullied.
By washing away the
sins of the sinners.
