The only wonder of the Earth.
Which can be seen
even from the space.
The Great Wall of China.
There was only one reason
to build this wall,
The Defense of the Country.
Enemies kept on attacking.
He kept on fighting.
The biggest warrior of
the history of China.
Lou Shang
Today this wall is only an
attraction for tourists.
And the warriors are reduced
to the statues on the roads.
Now the enemy has returned.
Hojo!
Hojo ruled this village.
He knew there's a treasure
buried in this village.
He kept on selling that
to the foreigners.
The game Hojo was playing with
the villagers,
had only a defeat for them.
Only the death.
Only the helplessness.
ln hard times like this a blind
man looks at the sky.
But only those get help
who have courage to reach it.
They were seeking the light.
To eliminate the darkness
of their lives.
The key to their hope was
in their own past.
Their centuries old savior
has come back.
He is re-born.
Lou Shang.
ln some other guise.
ln some other country.
ln a country where the Lord
Buddha was born.
ln a city which is still
standing strong
even it got attacked
for seven times.
Near a Fort.
A fort who's strength shows
the courage of it's warriors.
Near a road-crossing, who's lights
are brighter then sunlight.
Under all such great things...
Their savior is waiting for them.
Laughing?
You are no more, son.
Where are you going to?
l bought lottery of 50 million.
l spent 100 rupees on that.
l asked forjust one favor.
Just one favor and you can't
do one thing.
You just keep on sitting
like this.
Just once Lord.
Just once get the lottery.
One, one, six, six.
l've won the lottery.
Keep it with you.
l got it, noodles with bread.
Here put it down.
l'm the only fool who keeps
on working like a dog.
Shut up.
Here!
Do you see this magical
taveez ?
You'll get lucky with it.
lt's a unique magical object.
Just for you.
Forjust... How much do
you have in your pocket?
What?
How much do you have
in your pocket?
l'll have to check that.
Only 2 notes.
Damn you.
Give it to me.
But shall l become
something?
Stupid! Just put it on.
After that you'll be up
and the world will be down.
Master!
l wish l had become something,
your menu would've finished.
Yes, even since you've come
l'm surviving.
Else l would've been begging
in front of the mosque.
l know everything.
You don't know a thing.
Had l worn that taveez,
l would've been very rich.
Hey Sidhu.
You are too naive.
Don't get into schemes
of such frauds.
Our luck in not in this.
lt's in here.
Do the hard work.
- Hard work give only sweat.
Not the money.
l need money. And for
money l need luck.
And for luck you need
hard work.
Don't take out your anger
on that.
lt's our fate that we have
to work everyday to survive.
Don't make hollow plans.
No miracle will happen.
How any miracle will happen
when l didn't wear taveez.
Miracle!
Ganeshji appeared
in potato.
Look!
Ganeshji appeared in potato.
Hail Ganesh, hail Ganesh.
Will you tell us why Ganeshji
chose a potato to appear on?
Don't talk just prostate
and go out.
Weekly money?
- Money?
My money.
l knew Bappa will send
you on time.
Just be patient with me.
Don't smash eggs.
You too are here?
You always follow me
in every wedding.
Don't spare him.
Beat him
Beat him.
l'm the bridegroom.
Why are you beating me?
lt's my wedding today.
You're ruining me.
Remember one thing.
You won't find any vegetable
cutter better then me.
Even you search the
whole Chandni Chowk.
l'm best Mughlai...
Where did he go?
And...
Chinese?
He too...
Chinese?
How should l tell them...
They think the toothpick
is arrow.
What are you doing?
You're getting a chance
to have foreign money.
And you're refusing it.
lf you say to Sidhu that
these Chinese are
taking him to fight with
a dangerous enemy.
He will never go with them.
You speak the truth. At least
he will live.
lf you give him this chance,
he'll always be grateful.
What if that Hojo kills him?
Your blood is calling you.
You have to honor your
Chinese blood.
Go on the shoulders of Sidhu
and earn money from them.
Don't do this.
lt's sin.
Don't listen to him.
He's an ass.
Walk of the path of the truth.
Truth?
Truth you get you killed.
What are you looking here
and there?
And what they are talking
in Sindhi?
Dado Hojo?
lf you tell him that Dado Hojo
means to kill Hojo.
The whole plan will be ruined.
Say something else.
Dado Hojo means you're
too sexy.
You too are sexy.
Very sexy.
They were also speaking some
thing more.
What does that mean?
They mean to say that
you're blessed with Ganeshji.
When such blessing happens,
all things a changed.
That Ganeshji has decided that
you're not for these fishes and all.
You were a brave king of
China in you previous lifetime.
Lou Shang.
Dado Hojo.
l'm going...
Chandni Chowk to China.
Can l get a girl like
her in China?
Like her?
You'll have to stay in
the queue to get Chinese visa.
No matter if you're
Miss TSM or whatever.
Tell your story to these people.
Maybe any of them can
help you.
l can't help you.
Come inside.
Come
Show your passport madam.
Do you have the token?
Yes
Lord Ganesh.
My lovely Lord.
Ganpati,
You've come and everything
is lit up.
Just it's lack only that
beautiful girl.
Miss TSM

with everything.
Please listen to me.
Please Ganpati.
Oh my God.
My friend Ganesh!
The dish is ready before order?
Listen to me l know

You're so delicate and pretty.
You're not simple woman

My number has come,

Hey give me my token.
l'll slap you.
Will you go to China?
No l won't

Take this bag and
put it in the shop.
Nobody can stop the
wind.
Neither talks nor kicks.
Let him go.
You cheater.
l'll hit you with the shoe
that you'll get back in senses.
You always trust
Wrong men.
You're doing the same
mistake today.
Let me go, it will
get my dream come true.
Don't live in dreams.
You'll have nothing when
you'll wake up.
What do l have now?
Who's with me?
l don't have money, home,
servants, cars, nothing.
l don't even have a mother.
l'm scared.
My life started from a dustbin
and will finish in a dumpster.
You were this little when l
became your guardian
and raised you this big.
And you're talking about
a dumpster.
You trust that cheater.
You believe a potato
as your lord.
But you don't in yourself.
l scold you
l beat you
l have no right over you.
Do l?
You talk about the dumpster.
All right.
You can go.
l don't need anyone.
Dada! Please stop.
Stop.
l understand.
That you've taught me
to walk.
You've raised me.
My fate is not here.
My fate is there in China.
l know of one thing.
lf l fall you'll hold me.
Don't be mad.
Let me go.
lf everything goes well,
promise me.
You'll come to see me
in China.
China? No, no.
lf you won't come who will
kick me on my behind?
How will l fly in the air?
Tell me frankly,
that you'll be alone here that's
why you're not letting me go.
lsn't it? Don't lie to me.
Be careful.
A green forest who look
beautiful from far
might be too dangerous
from inside.
That's how, with the blessings
for his Dada...
Sidhu left for China.
l'll shut it down,
luggage will fall.
This is a wicked woman,
we shouldn't trust her.
She is too wicked.
Speak low..
You should not trust
any Woman
Who threw the banana shell?
Beware all Chinese!
Let's sleep.
Hail Ganpati! l'm in China.
Be good, you still have time.
Look everyone has a student
and you have a sack.
Potato Bread!
Get aside.
Stop her.
Where were you going?
Beautiful, delicate?
Or wicked and evil?
How come you've become
a Chinese?
The guise according
to the country.
From Rampuri knife to
a Chinese nanchakoo.
What's this?
Where did this oven come
from?
Who made breads out
of it?
Are you crazy?
Why are you bothering that lady?
She's not a lady.
She's cheater lady.
Miss TSM.
l won't spare her.
Wait l'm coming too.
Hay Madam, who's this Choochi?
Who's this Choochi?
To find out the reality of Sidhu,
Hojo sent his faithful Joey to lndia.
She was confused that why
did Sidhu was after her?
What did Sidhu see
in her face?
l'm Miss TSM from lndia,
Sakhi.
How should l explain them?
You're welcome to TSM China.
Miss Sakhi.
James Bond?
Now you'll say it's a
parachute too.
Take madam's luggage to
the car.
Come Madam.
Can l ask something?
You're a celebrity in lndia.
Yet you've come here by yourself
to collect samples.
From lndia to China.
This far.
Far?
Actually China is too close to me.
lt's the same place where my
mom met my dad.
lt's the same place...
Where l and my twin sister
Suzy were born.
lt's the same place..
Where my family got destroyed.
You take Suzy and...
- You go l'll come.
Yes.
- And you?
There bodies couldn't be found.
And mom couldn't bear
that incident.
And she too...
She used to always say
that they are alive.
l've come to China.
l've come this far.
For the peace of their souls.
For their peace.
Om Shanti
Who's this?
Dad!
Suzy?
l've never met you.
But l promise you that
l'll never forget you.
Subtitles!
They're saying the Lou Shang
died right here.
No he didn't die.
He was martyred.
Easy.
Why are you standing?
Pay respects.
Too many fans in China of TSM!
Police too?
Autographs?
No autographs?
You're under arrest.
- Arrest?
Actually, l fell.
l didn't know what happened.
Not here.
There.
What have l done?
l have come.
No one will recognize me.
She returned unsuccessful
once again.
She thought her time has come.
But Hojo wanted something else.
Sidhu's death.
lt's our lndia's song.
Hey God, why is it so itchy?
Chanchal, Sheetal, Komal?
Whatever happened, it was my thinking.
lt's not my fault.
Please try to understand.
l didn't do anything but police is still
after me.
Teacher, tommorow my photo will
be printed in the newspaper.

Your photo?
Yours too.
Teacher, l'll sleep with you.
Go now.
Careful.
Sleep here.
She changed her clothes!
Where did you come from?
Save me.
Teacher, l'm the expert of this song.
l'm so scared.
l'll sleep in your sack.
What are you doing, teacher?
Nothing, close the door.
l'll be back.
Teacher, lock it well she comes
out again and again.
She's a very clever woman.
Come on let's sleep.
What a girl.
So beautiful.
But like the villagers she also thinks
that Siddhu is Lu-Shang.
He's nothing.
He cuts vegitables on Chandni Chowk.
He does as l say.
He's not Lu-Shang.
That's what l was saying.
Siddhu is nothing.
Meow Meow has found a precious
gift for Hojo this time.
Key to the death of Siddhu.
You don't need to tell him anything.
Tell them.
His reality.
He's nothing.
He's just a fraud.
He cuts vegitables.
He's a fool.
Daddy, l have made him a fool.
He doesn't even know that he's been
brought here to kill Hojo.
He's telling the truth.
l've brought proof. Hojo.
She always breaks the lock.
What do you want now?
I'm Iike a dog.
Nor here or there.
I can't go back to Chandni Chowk.
PIease give me work here, I'II
do anything, I'II poIish your shoes.
To bring Meow Meow and Sakhi
