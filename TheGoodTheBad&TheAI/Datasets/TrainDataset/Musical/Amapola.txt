Mmm.
Hey.
Hi.
Busy day for you, right? Yes.
I have to go now. My mother...
Just a second, please.
Is there any chance for us to talk somewhere
less crowded, maybe, a little later?
I'm sorry.
Have we met before?
No. Not yet.
Um, maybe.
Okay.
Where and when then? Where and when.
Where and when?
Uh, okay.
I'll see you in the tapestry hall in...
one hour.
- Okay?
- Okay.
- Okay, wait. Where did you say again?
- The tapestry hall!
Okay.
I'll-I'll see you there.
We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
Ama. Ama, I have
a letter for a guest.
Monsieur Samirof.
When you see him,
will you give him this?
What is it? I can't tell you.
It's a secret.
A secret?
Okay, Meme.
I'll take it to him right now.
What's his room number?
He always stays in 786.
Okay. 786.
Okay, Meme. Thank you. Bye.
Â¡Eso!
Muy bien.
Hey, baby.
Hello.
My name is Samirof.
I know who you are.
You are Amapola.
Meme's granddaughter, right?
- How do you know that?
- I know things.
I suppose this is for you.
Hmm. For me, huh?
Oh. Meme's perfume.
Thank you.
Please tell her that I'm
impatient to see her again.
I will.
Au revoir, monsieur.
At your service.
No, no.
It is I who is at your
service, mademoiselle.
Merci beaucoup.
Merci.
Is there something wrong?
Uh, no.
Just feel dizzy.
Eh, rest for a moment, please.
It's nothing. It's
just...
Here.
You have often
episodes like this?
SÃ­, twice, actually.
Clearly, you are very sensitive.
Sensitive?
Yes.
Sensitive to... subtle
vibrations, at least.
What do you mean by vibrations?
You see, the universe sends us
messages all the time.
Vibrations.
And for certain people like you, those
vibrations become intuitions...
or visions, if you want.
That is what affects your
perception of time and space.
Yes.
Sometimes very painful.
Hmm.
Hello.
Hey.
Hi.
You are punctual.
Yes. And I was very lucky to find
this incredible place on my own.
This hotel is full of secrets.
Yes. This room was
my grandfather's pride and joy.
Midsummer Night's Dream, right?
Yes. That's Pyramus and
Titania right there.
No, I mean the play that you
guys are putting on tonight.
Oh, it's just our homemade
version, I'm afraid.
Poor Shakespeare.
Everybody seems to take it
very seriously.
People come from all over
to see it, actually.
It's such an incredible play.
I did it once.
In high school.
Who did you play?
Pyramus.
And believe it or not,
I wasn't very good.
That's hard to believe.
Where did you go to school?
Boise, Idaho.
Ever heard of it?
No.
Is it nice? Nice?
It's the nicest place
on God's green earth.
Except for right here,
of course.
Do you miss it?
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
It's not perfect,
but to watch the sun set over the
panhandle, sipping a mint julep...
What's a mint julep?
Only the most delicious
libation known to man.
So what brought you so far
from Boise, Idaho?
You ever heard of
the Vietnam War?
Only a couple thousand times,
yes.
Well, I've heard about it
so many times...
that I decided to skip the
fight and go on a journey.
So here I am,
traveling the world...
and taking pictures
that I rarely sell.
So, technically,
you're a draft dodger.
I prefer
"conscientious objector."
So, how long have you been
conscientiously objecting?
A couple of years now.
Can I take your picture?
Here?
Well, why don't you
show me your world?
We don't have to go far.
I just...
I just want you to
show me something you love.
Okay.
Okay.
Wait.
Mmm.
Smells delicious.
This is my favorite place.
No one ever gets to come here.
Let me get that.
No, no, no.
What's she saying? You can
get fruit in the other room.
For me?
SÃ­.
What did she say?
She reminded me that I once gave
the river something I loved...
and asked for it
to bring true love back.
And did it?
I wonder.
I'm starting to think that...
miracles do happen.
This... is the most
delicious thing on earth.
I thought that was mint julep.
I wasn't talking
about the fruit.
Shall we dance?
Here?
Here and now.
This is crazy.
Yeah.
When I was a child,
I used to come here every day...
to practice my lines
for the play...
and pretend I was a prima Donna.
It's never too late for that.
To be a prima Donna?
On this island?
I like it here, but it's not
a place to become a star.
Yeah, but Ama,
this is your world.
You can stay
or you can leave this island.
You can do what you want.
You're a very surprising
creature, Luke.
It's stopped raining.
Come.
I feel like, uh...
Like there's something
I have to tell you.
But I, uh...
I don't know what it is.
I-It makes no sense,
I know...
because we just met, but, uh...
But it's true.
Makes perfect sense.
It does?
Yes, it does.
-
-
Meme?
Meme?
Ama. Ama.
What?
Ama.
What?
No. Don't move! Don't move.
What? What happened?
I saw those horrible visions, and I
don't know if it was a vision at all.
But it was just...
very frightening.
I don't know. I don't understand.
Uh...
Sometimes it's not so important
to understand things,
but to act.
Action is greater than thought.
What do you mean?
Your visions only happen because you
can be in different moments in time...
simultaneously.
There are many worlds, Ama,
but they are all here.
Mm-hmm.
Oh!
Can you please give me a hand?
We are going to the
same place, right?
Oh, looks like it.
Thank you.
What's in here anyway?
Mostly Luke's cameras. And boy,
do they weigh a ton and a half.
Well, if he knew, he wouldn't
have asked me. If he knew what?
Let's say I'll be
eating for two.
Are you okay?
Great. I'm great.
Does Luke know?
No. I want to keep it this
way for now, at least.
You know how men get. I
want to keep him focused.
Uh-huh.
So it's our secret for now.
Of course. Mm-hmm.
I knew I could trust you.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Mesdames et messieurs!
SeÃ±oras y seÃ±ores.
Forgeries, jealousy.
These are the forgeries
of jealousy.
These are the...  Hey!
Luke! You frightened me.
We need to talk.
Not now.
Just a word.
Why aren't you talking to me?
Get out. Ama, listen to me.
I thought about it.
Get out, Luke.
I love you.
- Just stop.
- I know this is happening too fast, but...
But it's true.
Ama, you
have to talk to me. Please, Ama.
Hello again.
Luke, get out. Get out!
No. Not until we make plans.
Plans for what?
Plans for life.
Life? You're mad.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm mad.
I'm madly in love.
I spoke to Sisy. Sisy? Ah.
That's not what you think.
It's not, Luke?
What is it?
We only met two months ago.
Bravo!
Bravo!
- Luke!
- Ama!
Luke!
Luke!
Ama!
Ramiro. Ramiro.
No, no, no, no.
She looks so young.
-
-
Luke?
Hi, kid.
I remember this room.
My favorite room.
It's all ruined.
I'm sorry about Meme.
How are you?
I don't know.
Yes.
I always stay in Buenos Aires.
Yeah.
You never left?
No.
Are you still taking pictures?
I sold the cameras
a long time ago.
What about you?
I can't explain anything.
Did you come alone?
What?
What do you mean?
Why would you ask me that?
Well, what about Sisy?
Sisy?
You have a child with her.
- What?
- A child.
So that's why you
never answered my letters.
No. Ama,
don't you understand?
Sisy was never pregnant.
Everything she told you
was to get rid of you.
Oh, Meme.
Ama.
Ama, don't cry.
Ama.
Ama, destiny is handing you
a unique opportunity.
It's just a dream,
but it's a dream that you're
dreaming for a purpose.
Ama.
Who do you think's
looking at the river now?
You.
This universe only exists
because you are looking at it.
And who's looking at me?
You are, little one...
because you are this universe.
Ama, the wonderful thing is that
you can dream a new world...
A world that's much better
than this one,
a world where you can be happy.
But you've got to dream
a better dream.
We are travelers.
Luke.
Hello. Can I help you?
Oh. Thank you.
I'm looking for the east wing.
Oh. This way.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
This weighs a ton,
and, you know, I didn't see any
bellboys near here. Mm-hmm.
Here. Let me take that.
One shouldn't be carrying
all this in your condition.
Oh.
What do you mean,
in my condition?
Oh! I don't know. I saw the clothes and
thought you might be pregnant and...
Me pregnant?
Mm-hmm.
No, please, dear. Bite your tongue.
No, no, no.
Do I look that fat?
Oh. Oh!
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
No, don't worry.
You thought I was pregnant, not
dying of cancer, okay? That's true.
Here. This gentleman
will help you to your room.
Oh, perfect.
Thank you.
Well, it's very kind of you.
Mm-hmm.
And very efficient.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Those look very heavy.
I thought you might like
one of these.
We'll meet again
Wait. Is that...
Is that a mint julep?
It is.
Don't know when
How the heck did you know
that was my favorite drink?
Lucky guess, I guess.
Sunny day
Why do I get the feeling
that we know each other?
I-I don't know how, but...
Don't
know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again
some sunny day
-   - I know that one.
It's "We'll Meet Again."
- Right?
- Yes.
There is something you're not
telling me, isn't there?
I can't explain anything
to you now,
but I do have something
very important to tell you.
I'm listening.
No. Not here.
Where? When?
I'll explain everything to you soon.
I promise.
I'll see you in the
tapestry hall in an hour.
Where? The tapestry hall.
Upstairs.
Ask anybody.
I have something to do first.
Wait. What's your name again?
- Ama.
- I'm Luke.
I know.
- Don't forget. Tapestry hall, 6:45.
- I won't forget.
Hey, hey, hey.
No.
Darling.
Meme?
Oh, you're back.
Hi, Meme.
Vamos, vamos.
There's a lot of work to do.
There's your costume. You
can get changed into it.
Thank you, Meme.
It's showtime.
My baby. My little
one, it's showtime.
Okay, Meme.
Go out there and shine.
My costume.
MamÃ¡, sÃ­ podÃ©is.
Mm-hmm.
Hello, Luke.
Hey.
I-Is that a secret door?
This place is full of secrets.
I see.
Well, it's 12:30.
Here I am.
What's so important you've got
me sneaking around like that?
Shall we dance?
Dance?
Yes. Dance.
All right.
Do you often dance
with strangers?
No.
We're short one actor tonight.
Now, you wouldn't happen to know the
text to A Midsummer Night's Dream?
As in Shakespeare?
Yes.
It's a funny thing. I-I haven't
thought about it in ages,
but just today
it was on my mind.
Why do you ask?
And by some
incredible coincidence,
do you happen to know
the role of Pyramus?
Hey.
Either you're a witch,
or someone's been telling
you about me. Yes.
Well, yes, but...
Yes, I know the role
of Pyramus by heart.
This isn't a coincidence, right?
What's a coincidence anyway?
Listen, I... I know we don't know
each other very well, but I...
I think that we do
know each other.
Very well, in fact.
So you feel the same?
I feel so many things.
That's for the things we haven't
done yet but we'll do very soon.
What was that for?
That was for me.
We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know we'll meet again
Some sunny day
Keep smiling through
Just like you always do
Till the blue skies
Drive the dark clouds
Far away
So will you please
say hello
To the folks that I know?
Tell them I won't be long
They'll be happy to know
That as you saw me go
I was singing this song
We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know we'll meet again
Some sunny day
Sapo.
Okay.
Okay, ciao.
Oh! Oh!
Luke.
Luke.
Ama!
Hey, hey, hey.
Ama?
Ama?
Ama?
Oh, Ama.
Titi?
Titi.
Titi.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Madames et messieurs.
We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know we'll meet again
Some sunny day
Keep smiling through
Just like you always do
Till the blue skies
Drive the dark clouds
Far away
So will you please
say hello
To the folks that I know?
Tell them I won't be long
They'll be happy to know
