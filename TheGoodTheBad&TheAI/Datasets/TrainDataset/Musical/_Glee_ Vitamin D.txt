rachel and the glee club know
that quinn's pregnant, but they
all think finn's the father,
when really it's puck.
oh!
yikes! and terri's only fake
pregnant and wants quinn
to give her her baby so will
won't find out.
How come you haven't had any
morning sickness?
oh, and also,
ken is dating emma,
but she's really got eyes
for mr. shue.
and that's
what you missed on...
Five, six, seven, eight.
step, turn,
Out, in, ball-change,
step ball-change step.
You, you, you, you.
And ba-ba-ba. turn...
Come on, guys,
you're sleepwalking on me here.
Give me some energy.
we've got sectionals in two...
Please, sectionals
is going to be a breeze.
Maybe so.
but if we coast
through sectionals,
We're gonna get
killed at regionals.
We have got to be on our game.
Sorry.
funny youtube.
It's the grape stomping one.
The kids have gotten
really complacent.
It's like the fire
has totally gone out.
Um, um, i'm sorry,
you've just, uh...
You've got a little
Mustard in your cute
kirk douglas chin dimple.
Wha...? huh?
I get it?
Um...
Here, let me.
Hold on.
There.
Thanks.
Um, so...
Uh, when did... when did
this start to happen?
A week ago.
Rachel:
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.
great news, guys.
Just got the competition
bracket for sectionals,
And we are in really good shape.
There's only two other teams.
We beat them,
we make it to regionals.
Uh, who are the other teams?
Drumroll please, finn.
School for the deaf in dayton
And someplace called
jane addams academy.
Jane addams?
that's a halfway house
For girls just getting out
of juvie.
Th-th-this is great.
People who can't hear
what they're singing
And criminals
who don't care.
It's gonna be
a cakewalk.
High fi...
will:
they think they've got it
in the bag,
so they've simply
stopped trying.
I've got to figure out
some way to motivate them.
Okay, well, you,
um, you could...
Oh, what about
a sticker board?
That's how my parents
Got me to do chores
when i was a kid.
Right, so i'd do a chore
And then i'd get a star,
and then...
oh, dear god,
please, please...
Stop talking.
I'm trying desperately
to ignore
The treacly sweet inanity
Of our asinine
conversation,
But now i've got bile
in my mouth
And i will hold my tongue
no further.
You know what this is?
It's a list
of my cheerios.
Every week i pick
someone at random
And i kick them out.
Yeah, well, in glee club we do
things a little bit differently.
Oh, yeah, will?
How's that working out
for you?
You have to
remember something.
We're dealing with children.
They need to be terrified.
It's like mother's milk
to them.
Without it, their bones
won't grow properly.
So if you want results
with a kid,
You find that competitive
animal within and unleash it.
Okay.
Ellen, that blouse
is just insane.
I can't believe she's allowed
to teach at this school.
You know...
She may have a point.
Competition.
Every one of these people
or elements
Was a champion
in their own right.
But they used competing
with each other
To make themselves
even better.
I don't understand
how lightning
Is in competition with an
above-ground swimming pool.
Just go with it.
You guys have become
complacent.
You were great at
the invitational,
But you got to up your game
if you want
To get through sectionals.
Okay, split up.
Guys on the left side,
girls on the right side.
Let's go, come on.
All right.
Kurt.
Here's the deal.
Two teams-- boys versus girls.
One week from today,
You will each perform
a mash-up of your choice.
What's a mash-up?
A mash-up is when
you take two songs
And mash them together
To make an even
Richer explosion
of musical expression.
Boys will perform on tuesday,
girls the next day.
I want you guys
To go all out, okay,
costumes, choreography.
Whoever wins
the competition
Gets to choose the number
That we do for
sectionals.
Wait, who's going
to be the judge?
Your gender
makes you biased.
Ah...
There is going to be
A celebrity judge.
Wh-who?
Oh, you're going to have
to show up to find out.
We got this in the bag.
totally.
I'm going to start storyboarding
our choreography tonight.
Hey, i hope you guys
are up for this competition.
The girls look pretty pumped.
We're planning on smacking them
down like the hand of god.
Hey, finn, you all right?
You seem a little
out of it.
Yeah, i'm just
a little worn out.
Puck:
come on, dude.
We're late
for football practice.
sue:
"dear journal.
"feeling listless
again today.
"when i tried making a smoothie
out of beef bones,
"and then
at cheerios practice--
"disaster.
"it was like spotting the first
spark on the hindenburg:
"that quiver
will lose us nationals.
"and without
those endorsements,
i won't be able to buy
my hovercraft."
Feeling
all right, quinn?
I'm just really tired
from glee club.
sue:
"glee club.
"that clutch of scab-eating,
mouth-breathers,
"like some sexually ambiguous
horror movie villain.
"and i've sacrificed everything
only to be shanghaied
"by the the bi-curious
machinations
"of a cabal of doughy,
misshapen teens.
"am i missing something,
journal?
...chin dimple.
sue:
of course,
it's coming clear to me now.
i'll just have
to destroy the man.
Let me be frank.
Your husband is
hiding his kielbasa
In a hickory farms gift basket
that doesn't belong to you.
What?!
With who?
Guidance counselor.
Real floozy and
a man-eater.
Wears creepy brooches
like the kind
My nana was buried in.
More tea.
Oh, sorry.
It's the same old song.
Wife puts on a couple
extra pounds...
Oh, i'm pregnant.
Oh, that's no excuse.
I've always thought the
desire to procreate showed
Deep personal weakness.
Me-- never wanted kids.
Don't have the time,
don't have the uterus.
Are you sure about this?
A woman always knows.
Let me put it to
you this way--
If it's not a
full-blown affair,
Well, it's certainly
heading in that direction.
You need a machete
to cut through
The haze of lust
that surrounds them.
Oh, god, what am
i going to do?!
I think you should both pack up
and move out of the district.
Unless you want to lose your man
To a mentally ill ginger pygmy
with eyes like a bush baby.
Now you're absolutely
sure about this?
I mean, you have proof?
Get into that school
and sniff out
Those sex pheromones
for yourself.
We happen to have an opening.
Our school nurse,
mrs. lancaster, is in a coma.
Oh, she took a terrible tumble
down the stairwell yesterday.
But i'm not a nurse.
I work at sheets n' things.
I'm not an american citizen.
I was born in the
panama canal zone.
But i managed to
get a passport.
I've run for office twice.
My advice to you,
If you want to keep
your husband...
...get creative.
Mrs. schuester,
I appreciate your interest
in the nursing position.
But your previous
experience
Is limited to folding
hand towels.
As assistant manager
at sheets n' things,
I've had first aid training.
Mm-hmm.
I've also used a defibrillator.
Hmm.
So what did you want
to talk to me about?
Oh, good news.
I figured out a way
to get the kids motivated.
They're going to compete
against each other
In a glee-off.
Oh.
and guess who the celebrity
judge is going to be?
You.
Me?
You are the most
Honest and impartial person
i know.
Well, isn't this
a surprise.
Terri, wh-what
are you doing here?
Hi. i don't think we've
been properly introduced.
I'm terri schuester,
will's pregnant wife.
Hi.
Oh, honey,
Someone got a little lipstick
on your cup.
I got it.
Um, is everything okay, terri?
You-you never visit me at work.
Oh, i'm not visiting.
No.
You've been so stressed
about our finances lately,
That i thought i would pitch in
by getting a second job.
I'm the new school nurse.
But you're not a nurse.
You don't have
any training.
Oh, please, will.
It's a public school.
Isn't this going to be great?
This means I am gonna be around
all the time now.
"know your routes."
Now that is the key
to this play, gentlemen.
The receivers run
the fly route downfield
And then block
as the play develops, okay?
Know your assignments.
it's not...
finn:
i'm losing it.
Ken :
that's your only job
Is to know your assignments.
Will:
no sharps and no flats.
finn:
i know how lucky i am.
captain of the football team,
glee stud.
i know i should be excited
about quinn.
and she's carrying my baby
and all,
but i can't get rachel
out of my head.
she kind of freaks me out
in a swimfan kind of way,
but she can really sing
and her body is smoking...
i found a hair on my ear
the other day,
and i have to rub biofreeze
on my shins
a couple times a day--
growing pains.
it smells pretty bad, but
i mask it with drakkar noir.
between glee and football
and school and being popular,
everyone wants something
from me,
and i don't have the energy
to do it all.
i don't know how important
people like presidents
or newscasters
or mob bosses do it.
my mom says i'm stretched too
thin, so i gave up homework,
all i know is last night
i got vaporized on level two.
and i didn't even
have the energy to care.
:
he's drooling.
:
dude, wake up.
:
sure, yeah, that sounds good.
I said we can't let
those girls beat us.
Sorry. sometimes
when i'm thinking real hard,
It helps to close my eyes.
We're doing a mash-up
of "it's my life"
And usher's "confessions."
Puck : we should
get some trash can lids
and stomp the yard up
in this piece.
Puck, with respect,
You're more helpful
when you don't contribute.
Puck :
dude.
What's wrong
with you?
Go see the nurse.
Every day i say
i have a headache.
I sleep for three hours.
I haven't attended
a math class in two years.
Thanks, guys.
Keep up the good work.
Okay, girls, we need
to get started.
We're getting warmed up.
Where's quinn?
Probably down at the mall
looking for elastic-waist pants.
Mr. shuester's right, you guys.
We can't get complacent.
Chill out.
i already picked the songs.
We're gonna do
a mash-up of "halo"
And "walking on sunshine."
That was my idea.
Whatever.
Come on.
we can do this in our sleep.
You think those six dudes
Are gonna give us
any competition?
I say we just
wing it.
We can't just wing it.
All those in favor
of winging it?
All those opposed?
Looks like the ayes have it.
Hi. how can i help you?
Hey, mrs. shuester.
uh-huh.
I'm finn hudson.
i'm in glee with your husband.
Oh, hi, finn.
oh, wait a minute.
Are you the one
who's dating quinn fabray?
Yeah. why?
Oh, you have really good
bone structure.
Yeah, um,
I've been really
tired lately,
And i was wondering if i could
lie down in here for a while.
Why don't you have a seat?
Why don't you tell me
a little bit
About your sleep habits?
What time do you go to bed?
Um, i don't know.
Usually, after skinemax starts
playing regular movies again.
And i'm normally tired,
But lately
i can't just fall asleep.
It's like my brain
won't shut up.
Well, what are you
thinking about?
Oh, you can be honest with me.
There's a code of silence
in my office.
Okay, uh, football plays...
Uh-huh.
...um, girls,
Dance steps... girls.
Girls? but you're dating
quinn fabray.
Yeah, but...
Do you think a guy can be
into two girls at once?
No.
And remember,
flirting is cheating.
And the revenge of the jilted
woman is usually pretty messy.
So can i take my nap now?
Do you want to sleep
through your life, finn?
No, but i read once
That teenagers need more sleep
than infants.
When i was in high school,
I captained the cheerleading
squad, i kept a perfect 4.0 gpa,
I cultivated my popularity,
And i maintained
a loving relationship
With the boy who would
become my husband.
Wow.
I don't even know
how i did that.
Wait a minute.
yes, i do.
Pseudoephedrine.
It's the stuff
they put in decongestants
To make them non-drowsy.
It's kind of like a...
well, like a vitamin.
I would pop two of these
blue meanies every morning
And then i would be
a firecracker
For the rest of the day.
Are they safe?
they're over-
the-counter.
They stock them next
to the candy bars.
Sweetie, i'm the
school nurse.
I know what i'm doing.
Hey, guys, how's it going?
god, it's a beautiful day.
Let's run through the number.
I can't wait
to do the number.
I'm ready
and excited.
Are you guys?
stand up. come on.
Let's get this
joint jumping.
Has your soul been taken over
by caffeinated space aliens?
No, just visited
the school nurse.
Got this great vitamin.
i feel fantastic.
I can't wait to do the number.
Let's do the number,
and then afterwards,
We can build a house for
habitat for humanity.
What kind of vitamin?
Vitamin c?
vogue magazine says
it boosts energy levels
And brightens the
complexion.
Vitamin d.
And i got you guys some.
this ain't a song
for the brokenhearted
no silent prayer
for the faith departed
and i ain't gonna be
just a face in the crowd
you're gonna hear my voice
when i shout it out loud
it's my life
it's now or never
i ain't gonna live forever
i just want to live
while i'm alive
it's my life
these are my confessions
and just when i thought
i said all i could say
my chick on the side said
she got one on the way
these are my confessions
if i'm gonna tell it,
then i gotta tell it all
damn near cried
when i got that phone call
i'm so thrown
i don't know what to do
but to give part two
of my...
better stand tall
when they're calling you out
don't bend, don't break
baby, don't back down
these are my confessions
it's now or never
i ain't gonna live forever
these are my confessions
i just want to live
while i'm alive
it's my life
just when i thought
i said all i can say
my chick on the side said
she got one on the way
these are my confessions
i just want to live
while i'm alive
it's my life.
Awesome, guys.
Geez, i didn't know
you had it in you.
It's like somebody slipped
something in your juice boxes.
Whoo!
You ladies better
bring it tomorrow.
Otherwise,
We've got our opening number
for sectionals!
Haven't seen you
at glee rehearsals.
I'm not superwoman.
I know glee is your whole life,
But i have the cheerios,
I'm on honor roll,
i have friends.
You don't have to
be embarrassed.
No one at glee is
gonna judge you.
Look, i know everyone
expects us to be enemies
And be in competition,
but i don't hate you.
Why not?
i've been awful to you.
That was before you knew
what it felt like to be me;
An outsider.
More people are gonna start
finding out about this,
And you're gonna need friends
who can relate.
How can you relate
to what i'm going through?
You don't think people
whisper about me
In the lunchrooms
or draw pornographic pictures
Of me on the bathroom walls?
That was me,
Actually.
Look, i don't agree
with the choice you're making,
But you're gonna need glee.
You have seven months
of your youth left.
You should enjoy it.
And let's face it,
in a couple of months,
That cheerleading uniform
isn't gonna fit
And we're gonna be
all you have left.
Just come back to practice.
Boys versus girls.
it's fun.
And we could certainly use
your voice right now.
You're actually a
good singer, quinn.
Occasionally sharp,
but that's just because
You lack my years
of training.
I would have tortured you
If the roles were reversed,
you know?
I know.
Hi. it's terri.
Hi, terri.
this is howard bamboo.
Yeah, i know that, howard.
Okay, you know how
i'm moonlighting as a nurse?
Well, i need a favor.
O-okay.
Go to the drugstore
and get me a couple of boxes
Of decongestant.
I'm running low, and i want
the children at mckinley
To be healthy and happy.
Uh, h-how many boxes?
Um...
Thirty-six.
Hey, terri.
Oh, hi, ken.
what's up?
Can we talk frank?
Uh...
Listen...
We have a problem.
I think my girlfriend
is in love with your husband.
And i wouldn't be surprised
if the feeling was mutual.
How long has this
been going on?
I don't know.
a couple months.
I see them together all the time
laughing, talking...
All the stuff
she never does with me.
You know, i knew
something was up.
She couldn't keep
her eyes off him
At those acafella
clown shows.
Listen, has will
ever mentioned it to you?
Oh, no,
but he's too smart for that.
I mean, just barely, but still.
Oh, ken,
i got to be honest with you.
I only took
this job
So that i could
keep an eye on him.
We've got to put a stop to this
so that i can get out of here.
See, i'm not built to work
five days a week.
Well, i've been thinking
Maybe that if you and i started
seeing each other on the side,
It might kind of cancel
their thing out.
Are you two still having sex?
Because, you know, when that
stops, something is up.
We actually haven't,
um... had sex yet.
She doesn't like
to be touched.
By me.
Oh.
God, i love her so much.
Oh, uh...
Okay.
It's okay.
There, there.
Look at the two of us.
You pregnant, and
me with psoriasis
oh.
And one testicle
that won't descend.
I don't know who to
feel more sorry for.
Okay, that's enough.
You know what? you got
to stop being such a baby.
I cannot fix this unless
you are willing to man up.
Okay. i'm sorry.
here's what
you're going to do.
You're going straight to
the nearest department store
To buy her an engagement ring.
Then you're going
to get down on one knee
And you're going to ask
that doe-eyed little harlot
To marry you.
No. i can't do that.
What if she says no?
It might kill me.
Take two of these.
Then nothing can stop you.
I told you guys.
We know.
You've been berating us for
the better part of an hour.
Were they really that good?
They were, quinn.
look, i was fine with arranging,
Choreographing and directing
this number free of charge.
But we underestimated the boys.
Their number will go to
sectionals and once again,
I will be humiliated.
How were we supposed to know
they'd rock the house?
They've never been good.
How did they d-d-do it?
The real question is,
"what were they on?"
Though i've been
grouped with the boys,
My allegiance still remains
with you ladies.
They declined my offer
to do their hair in cornrows
And all my artistic decisions
have been derided as too costly
Because they involve
several varieties
Of exotic bird feathers.
My man, got next week's
plays all worked out.
Yeah. hey, mr. shue,
got that paper
On bariloche,
argentina on your desk.
But it's not due
for two weeks.
Damn straight.
i am in the zone.
Cheater.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
You took performance enhancers
before your mash-up.
Kurt told me.
It's deplorable,
contemptible,
And it's just plain wrong.
It's also cheating.
as a matter of fact,
I'm going to start
calling you f-rod.
Hey, hey, back off. i'm
nothing like a-rod, okay?
I'd never take steroids.
They make your junk fall off.
Listen, rachel, you don't
know what it's like for me,
The kind of
pressure i'm under.
Oh, we all have pressures,
but you know how i deal with it?
The natural way, with a rigorous
diet and exercise routine.
rachel:
i'm up at 6:00 a.m. every day.
i have my protein shake
with banana and flaxseed oil,
and by 6:10,
i'm on the elliptical.
and i won't rest
until i reach it.
Yeah, well, that's
personal pressure.
If you don't meet your goal,
you're the only one who loses.
I have to be the quarterback,
the male lead, and deal with
A pregnant girlfriend who
yells at me about ice cream,
So, yeah, maybe i helped me and
my teammates out a little bit,
But it's only because
i'm sick and tired
Of working so hard
and still losing.
Yeah, but winning
by cheating isn't winning.
Oh, don't give me that.
The only reason you're
so pissed about this
Is 'cause you know you
can't compete with us.
Oh, i am offended
by that accusation.
We haven't performed yet,
but if i may say,
Our mash-up is spectacular.
Still isn't going to be as good.
We're gonna win.
you're gonna lose.
Deal with it.
Everyone gets a dose.
Oh, except for quinn.
you get folic acid.
Mama.
:
it's good for the baby.
Get the lead out, howard.
We have patients waiting.
Are you sure
we should be doing this?
Oh, it's over-the-
counter. it's safe.
You can trust me.
I'm a nurse.
It's good for you.
What's up with ken?
Doesn't he have
a healthy glow?
I put him on a new
vitamin regimen.
Is that safe?
I mean, you're not
really a nurse, terri.
Don't start criticizing
my work, will.
Not when i'm just
getting my sea legs.
Isn't this nice?
I mean, when is the last time
We got to have lunch
together on a weekday?
hmm.
Oh, honey, you have
a little mustard.
Just...
Geez, terri.
This is my workplace.
i'm sorry, honey.
It's just that my hormones are
going really crazy for you.
Hey, look, look.
You being here is not good
for our marriage.
Spending time together
is not good for our marriage?
Not every minute.
There's no separation.
I mean, we used
to come home every night
And talk about our day.
Now we have nothing
to say to each other.
A lot of ants on
the sidewalk today.
Pretty late
in the season for that.
I think this is
just forcing us
To expand our
intellectual horizons.
Where are you going?
the bathroom.
I'll come with you.
no!
I love you,
but i need my space.
Mmm.
Now's your
chance, ken.
What, here? now?
yeah.
Hi, emma.
hi, ken.
What are you doing?
Look, emma,
i know our relationship
Hasn't been perfect--
you won't ride in my car,
I can't touch you
above the wrist.
Remember, you cried for an hour
that one time my elbow
Accidentally brushed
by your breast?
But i think about you
all day long.
I kiss that picture of us
at the state fair every night
Before i go to sleep.
Oh, my god. oh, my god.
oh, my god.
This isn't happening.
this is a dream.
Emma pillsbury,
this is not an engagement ring.
Oh, thank goodness.
no, i mean it is.
But it's more than
that. it's a promise.
Look, emma, i know you have
this thing about being clean.
Now, i can't promise
to pick up my underwear
Or squeegee the
shower door,
But i can promise to keep
your life clean of sadness
And loneliness
And any other dark clouds
that might float into it.
It's cubic zirconia.
i know how affected you were
by black diamond.
Emma pillsbury, eminem...
Will you marry me?
Thank you so much.
it really is a pleasure.
While the boys chose a selection
of songs that cast
An eye inward on
the irresponsible
Life choices and sexual hunger
of today's modern teens,
We have chosen a selection
of songs that speaks
To the nation as a whole
during these troubling times
Filled with economic uncertainty
and unbridled social woe.
Because if there's two things
america needs right now,
That is sunshine and optimism.
Also angels.
Okay.
oh...
remember those walls
i built?
well, baby,
they're tumbling down
they didn't even
put up a fight
they didn't even
make a sound
it's like i've been awakened
every rule
i had you breakin'
it's the risk
that i'm takin'
i am never gonna
shut you out
everywhere i'm looking now
i'm surrounded
by your embrace
baby, i can feel your halo
and don't it feel good
* i can feel your halo *
* halo *
* halo *
* i can see your halo, halo *
* halo *
* i can see your halo *
* halo *
* i can see your halo *
and don't it feel good
i used to think maybe
you loved me
now, baby, i'm sure
and i just can't wait
till the day
when you knock on my door
oh, now, now
i'm walking on sunshine
whoa
i'm walking on sunshine

halo.
Whoo!
Ladies, i-i don't even know
what to say.
You did
such a good job.
I don't know what
you guys did,
But whatever it
was, keep doing it.
Our celebrity judge has
her work cut out for her.
Hey, great
job, guys.
Okay! all right.
Whoo!
Ha!
Hey, emma, um...
Can you walk with me?
Yeah.
I think your, uh... i
think your plan worked.
Yeah.
Instilling a sense of
good, clean competition
In these kids,
i think, um...
I think you really
motivated them.
Well, actually, i consider
you a co-conspirator.
We came up with
the idea together.
So...
Is it true about ken
asking to marry you?
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Can you, um...
Can you think of any other
options i might have?
Is... is that a reason
to marry someone?
That's not what i'm asking.
Emma.
Terri.
Um, how are you?
What can i, uh...
What can i...
Do for you?
I just wanted
to cut to the chase.
Things have been
a little awkward since
I started working here.
i just wanted to clear the air.
Oh. that's, um...
That's actually really nice.
why don't you just...
You have no chance
with my husband.
Do i make myself clear?
Oh, you might think
there's some kind
Of competition going on
between you and i,
But that's like saying
That a nail is competing
with a hammer.
Terri, will is a good man.
Uh-huh.
He's kind and he's generous...
And he deserves a lot better
than you.
Emma, will is my husband.
Look at you.
You are so superior
because you're nice to a man
That you see
for an hour or two a day.
You're just an innocent
Little dove. hmm?
You're so innocent
that you would steal a man away
From his pregnant wife.
Yeah.
Do yourself a favor, honey.
Marry ken tanaka.
Oh, sure, he's dumb like sand,
And his fondue pot
of nationalities
Is gonna open your kids up
to a host of genetic diseases,
But he's kind
and he's generous.
And he's available.
Mrs. schuester.
Mm-hmm?
I need to talk
to you...
About the baby.
Is everything okay?
Wait, you're not having it
right now, are you?
What? no!
Aren't you supposed
to be a nurse?
Mm-hmm.
I've been thinking
about your offer.
Yeah?
I like my life.
I like being a cheerleader.
And i can't believe
i'm actually saying this,
But i really like
being in glee club.
I have all of these great things
in my life,
And it already feels like
too much.
:
i can't raise a baby.
You know, honestly,
i don't even know how
You kids do it nowadays.
I didn't have it this bad
When i was your age.
There weren't as many
tv channels either, though.
Is finn okay with this?
'cause, you know, i don't want
any baby daddy drama
When you hand it over to me.
He's the reason i'm doing this.
He's such a good guy,
And he internalizes
all this pressure.
He's gonna have a heart attack.
I never want mr. schuester
to find out about this, though.
I don't want to hurt him,
either.
Well,
your secret's safe with me.
I have a lot more to lose.
One more thing.
You know how you gave me
those vitamins for the baby?
Mm-hmm.
I really appreciated that,
But i'm gonna have
all these doctor's bills,
And i'm gonna need
some new maternity clothes.
You want money from me?
Which means i'm gonna be
paying the bills for 18 years.
I think you can handle
nine months.
Look, you're making
the right call here, quinn.
It's what's best for everybody.
Hi.
Hi.
Um, i can't... i can't stay long
in this room
Because of the germs,
you know,
And because of the odor.
But i have a question.
Anything for you, emma.
So what would, um...
What would getting married mean
Exactly?
Because i would want to keep
my last name.
And i'd want to continue living
in different parts of town,
And, um,
i think it would be best
If we didn't see each other
after school.
Sure.
And i wouldn't want
a big ceremony, you know,
Like in a church with people.
We wouldn't have to invite
anybody, you know,
Or tell anybody, actually.
It could be more like
a secret, you know,
Like a secret marriage.
That's actually a better deal
than i expected.
You're a really good man, ken.
And i don't want
to spend
The rest
of my life alone,
And i know that
you don't either.
So...
Is that a yes?
What's up, a-rage?
Hey, sweet mash-up.
you guys were so energetic.
We were just taking a lesson
from major league baseball.
It's not cheating
if everyone's doing it.
We were just leveling out
the playing field.
You really believe that?
No.
I feel terrible.
Even if we win,
it's not gonna be satisfying.
I know.
I don't even remember
performing.
What do you think
we should do?
I think... the only way
to make things right
Is to just withdraw
from the competition.
You know,
admit that we were wrong
And disqualify our
respective teams immediately.
No one gets to win.
Cool.
I'm sorry about
what i said the other day.
About calling you
contemptible and deplorable.
Ah, that's all right.
I didn't even know
what those words meant.
What i meant
to say is that
I guess i get caught up in
the competitive hysteria, too.
My goals are too selfish.
You know, it's time for me to
stop competing against everyone
And start competing
alongside them.
What the hell
were you thinking?
You gave drugs
to my students?
I'll say it again.
They're over-the-counter,
fda-approved.
And if i didn't give it to them,
i'm sure the kids
Would just find a way
to get it for themselves.
No, no, they wouldn't.
These are good kids.
Nothing bad happened.
Howard bamboo got arrested.
Well, that.
Wait. what?
Pseudoephedrine
is an ingredient
In the manufacturing
of methamphetamines.
Howard got picked up
By the feds on suspicion of
running a crystal meth lab.
I never told howard
to get them all in one place.
Okay, enough, terri.
How are we supposed
to raise a baby
When i can't trust you
to look after
A group of teenagers?
You are oblivious
to consequences.
I was only trying
to help you, will.
Don't!
Every time i light
a fire in my life,
You find a way to make sure
it burns the forest down.
Figgins:
i have serious concerns
About your judgment,
mrs. schuester.
I must ask you to
resign as school nurse.
Fine.
I was working too hard anyway.
Hold onto your horses, shue.
I have to question your
judgment in the matter as well.
What? i had no idea
this was even going on.
Exactly.
The children rely on you
to create the culture.
And you, with your
obsession with winning
And-and competition,
has fostered
An unsafe
environment.
I'm bringing in someone else
to co-chair the glee club.
Someone with a track record of
responsibility and excellence.
We're really sorry, mr. shue.
We didn't mean to get
you into trouble.
I'm really disappointed
in you guys.
Glee is supposed to be about
what's inside your heart,
Not what's coursing
through your veins.
We know. and i think i speak
for everyone when i say
That we'd be happy
to move forward
And put this
episode behind us.
Well, it's not that simple.
Because of this debacle,
it's been decided
That i'm no longer fit
to run glee club myself.
We've been assigned
A co-director.
Who?
Hey, kids.
i got to tell you,
I'm just thrilled to
be coming on board
To co-captain your little,
uh, showbiz cruise.
Ah, i can't wait to start
singing and dancing
And maybe even putting on
the ritz a little bit.
Will?
I wanted you to, um,
to hear this from me.
You know ken, um,
asked me to marry him.
I said yes.
That's...
That's great.
ain't nothin' gonna
break my stride
nobody gonna slow me down
oh, no,
i got to keep on movin'
ain't nothin' gonna
break a-my stride
i'm runnin'
and i won't touch ground...
