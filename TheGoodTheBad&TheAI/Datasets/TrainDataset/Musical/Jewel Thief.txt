Now I request the queen of sheyat
to distribute the prize.
The first prize for acting and
dancing goes to Miss. Shalini
Lot of people amongst you
must be aware of the fact-
That her father, who has
recently passed away.
Had spent his entire life in rendering
his services to the royal court.
You dance very well-
We will definitely organise a
programme of yours in our royal court
Yes, definitely.
Ay, what are you doing
what are you doing?
Sister... Sister... Sister.
The entire police force
on one side-
And this Robber
on one side.
It is indeed
a shame on us-
That we are
still unsuccessful
Sir, this Robber is now-a-days
under my jurisdiction.
I asure you, that he will not be
able to survive for a long.
Till the 26th of January, if I don't
produce him infront of you-
Wheter alive or dead-
I swear, I'll resign myself
from this job
Alright.
Call up Mr. Vishambardass,
I want to meet him.
I want to sell this.
Sir, The business of
selling is our's
If you want to buy something,
please order
But for selling-
You must be purchasing-from
somewhere or the other, isn't it?
He is there,
you can talk to him
He will sell the thieved merchandise
somewhere or the other is'nt it
May be he comes
at your place.
You don't worry, If something
like that happens-
You'll be informed
immediately.
But, Mr. Commisioner,
the only thing which scares me-
Is that, he might land up
here for his robbery.
That worry, you
leave it on us-
There is a very tight
surveillance in the city
Okay, Greetings
Greetings.
You.
Sir, who I am, and what I want, these
Questions are of no importance to you.
The only interest should be that
you need me, as much as I need you-
There is no jeweller like you,
and no assayer like me.
Leaving Bombay, for the four shops
in Delhi and Bangalore-
You do a purchase of
I give you a guarantee that if you pay
me a salary of 5000 per mensum
Then I can increase your
profit by 5 lakhs per year.
Look, this Mr. Has gone
out of his senses-
Show him the
way to outside.
The inside story is that I'll myself
look for the outside way
Actually I thought, that you were
a very good assayer-
You are always in search
for diamonds-
But I regret-
That a priceless diamond has himself
come in search of you-
And you are not
able to assay him
Probably for this alone
you require an assayer like me
Daddy in the evening I'll not be
available in the house
In the afternoon we are
going to our farm house
Come back soon
I'll come back
Just see, what has
happened to him?
Arey, he is not
getting up at all
Come let's go and see.
Arey, he has
become unconcious.
Now, what to do?
See if he is
breathing or not?
Come, Come let's
take him inside
A little forward, a little forward
my house is there
Have I told
something wrong?
Alright,
I'll go, I'll go
I extend my thanks
to all the ladies-
That with so much of
love and affection-
You have all made me
reach here-
If next time you do
something like this...
Is this any new fashion of wearing
an-ear-ring only in one ear
Even you have only
one ear-ring
Oh... search for it
Was it very costly?
Costly...?
It was a pair worth Rs.12000.00-
Now what will
daddy tell?
Even if anybody pays you
even 1200.00 for this-
Think that you have made
a profit of Rs.200-400
What did you say?
Tell it again
The truth is
always bitter
Even, if it is worth a penny
less than 12000.00-
Then, I'll loose on
whatever you say
You bet it.
Done
If it is worth a penny
more than 1200.00-
Then I'll loose this
innocent heart of mine.
Do remember
my address
I stay here only
near your neighbourhood.
Sir, it is absolutely
genuine-
That man is absoutely
tacking non-sense
That man, who is absolutely
talking non-sense-
Has proved.
That you all people
are talking non-sense
Inspite of looking into
it so minutely-
You could'nt get to know
of that defect-
Which his eyes could
look into it from far
Sir...
Sometimes a thirsty.
Goes to the well-
And sometimes the well
comes to a thirsty
Tell me, how did you search
of this poor dwelling?
Even you are interested
in catching fishes-
And even I am
Have you got hold
of any fish
I have thrown the hook;
let's see
It will get caught
Yesterday the worth of
the well was more-
And Today its
of the parched
Enough, enough, enough
Sir, you are throwing the hook
or are you spreading a net
If I get to see
a golden fish-
Then nobody
can say this-
That I am not an assayer
Sir, the rates you have
charged are very high
Sir, but how?
Sir, what I mean is that how can I
charge for a single pearl-
You are an old customer of mine
Altogether it's worth Rs. 1,25,000
Alright. I'll finish the deal
with you for Rs. 1,00,000
Sir, Beleive me, this time
I have gone to palaces-
For collecting diamonds, emeralds
and pearls-
With a great difficulty
Have patience
be seated
Yes. Ofcourse.
I am seated
I have written the rate for
each and every diamond-
Putting altogether, the deal is
worth Rs.72,450
You can carry on
But, if you pay
a penny more-
Then you are paying me
my salary for no reason
My dear, what's all this
talk to me
Rs. 72,450
Sir, I beg of you
Don't do this to me
Here, please correct it
Without the ear-rings the ears
look how much desolated
So, you have even
reached here
I have come,
but still not reached
You look to be
very clever
Your blessings are there
Do you work
over here?
Tell me, how can I
serve you
I need a necklace
Definitely
I'll show you
such a necklace-
That, once it touches
your neck
It will double
it's glitter
On this velvety fair neck, this
white necklace of genuine pearls
looks as if
Like, the sky which is dissolved
by the moon light
Is waving a flag
Probably, the priced is a little
high for you
Very less, show me
something costly
Definitely
How do you like this?
It seems like
a lake of milk
Upon which, it has golden leaves
with red lotuses blossomed on them
That's all, not so cheap, show me
something more costlier
And... Look at this
Sparkling rays have condensed and
have contracted on your neck
These diamonds wanted to
compete with your eyes-
But I think they are
now feeling shy
And it's also right
Because there is a saying, that for
a woman, shiness is her real jewel
That's the price
Beyond the diamonds
are your words
And you are
beyond my words
Look that...
Sir, look at this even
he would remember-
On the very first day itself I
have increase the sale by Rs.1,00,000
Very good, very good
Look, that negotiation has
been settled for Rs.80,000
What is your suggestion
on this?
Immediately settled for it
I knew that he would agree on 80,
that's why I told 72
Very good, very good.
I see, by selling a thing
for Rs.1,00,000
You want to make me
insolvent
What?
Don't you know, that she is
my daughter Anjali
Arey, Amar, I am
talking to you
Tell me,
How are you?
Do you know me?
Do I know you? Wonderful...
are you joking with me?
When did you come
to Bombay?
From where?
Where else? Friend, from Delhi
where else
You are under mistaken. My name is
Vinay and not Amar
Yes
Amar, good that I found you,
here. Take back your money
It was very helpful
at the right time.
Who told you that
I am Amar?
Alright, today you may
not be Amar
But atleast you keep
your money
Listen...
Why are you so much
preplexed
He has given you some thing
not taken
The evening was good, the food
was good, and your company too
Don't forget my party
Never
Does anybody stay in your shed
now-a-days, the light is on
Yes
You are holding my book
in your hands
I am Shalini
Probably you want to meet your
father, he is there
Daughter, how did you
come here?
Is she Anju?
Yes, yes
She has grown up
so much
After how many years am I
seeing her?
I think, after 1955
Which means 12 years
have passed-
How fast does the time
pass away
At that time, she used to roam
about wearing a frock-
Do you remember
Daughter, you don't know-
That your father and I are
childhood friends
We did our education together
started our business at the same time-
Now look, how big a business man
he has become
Did you meet Shalu?
What happened? Why are you
standing aloof like this?
Come here
She is my younger sister, Shalini
she has come first time to Bombay
Show her the city
Will you?
Yes, definitely
But Daddy, why didn't you make them
stay in the flat?
Here, who will take care
of their food?
I had very much
told them
Actually, we people are from
the highlanders
We get disturbed with the
fast city life
Here, there are no mountians covered
with snow, like in Sikkim
But, here there is
atleast fresh air water-
But this time you must definitely
come to Gangtok
I will definitely come
And...
And, I'll also bring Anju along
why Anju?
You'll come, is'nt it?
Yes definitely
The necklace that you are wearing
is realy beautiful-
Who gave it to you
is it daddy?
God bless you
Come let's go that side
Come
So finally you got the time
I have got little delayed
Now, your friends have also started
this joke with me
Amar, I went mad
waiting for you
And you didn't even
write to me-
As to where are you, what are you
doing, and when will you come back?
You forgot me so much
Miss. Shalu, his name is Vinay
and not Amar
Oh Gosh, as if I don't know
my fiancee's name
Amar, from when have you
become Vinay?
Madam, I am called Vinay right
from my birth-
You are forcing me
to become Amar
Why do you want to ridicule me
infront of every body?
What exactly do you
want to prove?
Why are you addressing me with
so much of respect?
I am your Shalu.
My Shalu
Is there any specific reason for
not recognising me today?
Madam, I would feel very happy
in recognising you-
But unfortunately, I haven't
met you before
Why are you joking?
I am not joking, but you are
getting deceived
I am getting deceived or
I have already got
What's this?
The ring which was
given by you-
The sign of our
engagement
Anju, just tell her how few people
have earlier got deceived like this
The talk is between
me and you-
Why are you dragging this
innocent in between?
That's because you don't beleive
on what I say
That's because
I am not Amar
Amar, after the engagement is over,
it can be broken-
But, this is not the way how
decent people should behave
Madam, men can be made
to get entrappet
But, this is not the way how
decent girls should behave
Amar, why are you insulting me
infront of so many people?
Whats this when I haven't met you,
how can I know you? -
When, I am telling that I am
not Amar
You are Amar and
only Amar-
You are not revealing your name,
may be because of any specific reason
Look, if any other girl has come
in your life-
If I am longer
that Shalu to you-
Without whom you were
not interested-
In spending even two moment's
of your life
If you feel happy in destroying
melike this-
Then tell me clearly even I'll
call you Vinay from today
Anju please,
somebody stop her-
I haven't seen her met her, she is
forcibility imposing her on me
Imposing on you... brother
Amar, this means at this time you
don't want to even recognise me
Why are you looking at that side?
Look here
Who is he?
He very well knows,
who I am
But he is
pretending
Either you are a brilliant hooligan
or you are trying to act.
Look brother either you are struck to
some misunderstanding or...
Don't blaber
Infront of so many
people-
I have done the engagement
of my sister with you-
Every child of Gangtok is a
proof of this-
And now you are
planily refusing
I don't understand, what trap is
being plotted against me?
What trap is being
plotted...
Tack decently.
There is a height for tolerance
By more, physical strength, if you
want to prove-
That I am not what I am
and somebody else
Then don't forget, that even I
have two hands
But Amar, why are you doing
like this?
If you want to break the engagement,
then tell us clearly-
We will not pressurise you
in any way
But, amongst so many
people you are...
That's because I am not Amar
you are lying, your sister is lying
No brother no...
Brother no...
Leave me-
It is better I get hanged after
killing such a person-
Atleast he will not be able to
insult somebody else.
You are insulting me
Neither I have met you,
nor do I know you-
And you say that I am related
to your sister
Amar, I am sure, decently you will
not tell the truth
No, brother no... brother
What are you doing? Leave, leve.
Leave me, I'll not
do anything.
I say leave me...
I just want to ask you
one question-
You say that I haven't seen you
anytime before
It's a fact.
It means that, I know about you
only much-
As I can know about you,
us of now
What exactly do you
want to say?
That right now you have
worn a shoe-
But still, I can tell that
trace of your leg-
Which may be known, to only those
who are very close to your-
And what's that?
Your right leg has
six finger's-
And if it's there,
then Amar, -
You are not disclosing your true
identity, with some special intention
And now you remove your shoes
in front of everybody and prove
That I am a lier
Look Mr... What ever
your name is...
I don't have to prove anything
about myself-, but...
By your talk, I have started
believing-
That you had been connected
to such a person-
Who in looks was as identical
as me-
Now in the capacity of
my decency-
I want to make you
believe
That I am not that person,
you are badly under deception
Which means you are scared
of removing the shoes-
You may think
the same
But, the truth is-
That, in such a big party
like this-
Removing shoes will be
against manners-
And secondly,
I am scared-
If my sock's
are torn-
This is nothing,
but an excuse
What do we understand
from this?
What should we
understand-
He is scared that the truth will be
unveiled if he removes his shoe
Vinay Why don't you show
your leg?
Now you will definitely have to
remove your shoe
Not left but right
Two people can resemble
so much
Shalu, we must seek forgiveness
from him
I... I am very
much ashamed
Brother, forgive me.
Your face resembls Amar to
such great ex tent-
That what myself, anybody
can get decepted
Who is it?
Mother...
Is daddy in
the house?
Wait
My child, my son, you have come
after so many months
But Mother, this time I haven't
come empty handed; Iook
Where have you brought
this from?
It is a stolen one...
I'll hit you, if you utter
something like that
This is of Genuine
pearls-
I have paid my entire month's
salary on this-
So, you have started woring,
thank's to God-
After all he gave you
the wisdom
If you would have listened to
your father, initially itself
What loss would have
you made?
IF I had listened
to my daddy-
Could I had ever bought for you
in my entire life
A necklace worth
Rs.10,000
You earn 10,000 rupees
in one month
Ask daddy, he has spent 40 years
in the service-
What salary does he
get now?
He has wasted his life, and was
bying to parcel mine too
Who is there
inside?
Whom were you
talking to?
I was talking...?
Are your ears
echoing?
I see, I thought as if I could
hear Vinay's voice
See this only
happens-
When you ask a good young boy
to leavefrom the house
Even if rats
make a noice-
It looks as if the voice of
the son is heard
By giving such an
unless child-
For what has the derting
taken it's revenge againt me?
By your telling, will anybody
become useless
one year he failed
in metric
One year he failed
in Inter
One year he failed
in B.A.
Alright
But still by God's grace I
atleast had that much of influence-
That I could have got that Ass a job
for 300-400 somewhere or the other-
But only if he had got time
other than collecting stones
Whenever seen, he'll be found
only collecting stones
Alright, as one sow's
so he reaps
If he collects only stones-
Then even in his destiny only
stones will get deposited
Then what?
You'll even call a diamond
to be a stone
You'll call a coral also
to be a stone
And, you'll call those pearls
also to be stones
Wearing a necklace, are you
in your senses
Arey, where did this
come from?
Where ever it has come from? It's
value is Rs.10,000
Arey, Rs.10,000 didn't even come
in your dowry
But, where did
you bring this from?
From where ever-
May be my useless son had
given this to me
Did Vinay come?
I am asking you, did Vinay
come here?
Who allowed him to enter
this house?
What did you say
Rs.10,000-
How did he get
Rs.10,000?
From where ever, How does it
concern you?
Look, let me make it clear-
That In my house such a thing
should not enter
May be it is a
stolen article
Yes, yes, in the house of a
police commissioner-
Will a Robber take birth or
an inspector of an police
But, where did he get such a
huge sum from?
Why, can't your son earn
such a huge sum?
My son, never-
If he blabbers that he has bought
this from his salary-
Then its worth can-not be more
than Rs.10
If it's worth Rs.10
let it be-
He has given it to me, why are you
feeling so jealous
I am feeling jealous, my God
I am feeling jealous
In his entire life he has
not earned a penny-
He'll buy a necklace
worth Rs. 10,000 and come
I am feeling
jealous
Please come
Why did you take the trouble
of coming?
You should have ordered me,
I would have come
Nothing, I had a
small work
What will be the price of
this necklace
Till yesterday. It was
in my shop
Was it stolen?
No no, I have appointed a
new attendant-
Yesterday, when his first
salary was given
He told me sir, in lieu of my salary
I want to buy this necklace
I told him, what's
the matter?
Whom are you giving this necklace
what Rs.10,000
He told me, it's for
someone's special
What is his
name?
Mr. Commissioner, that boy is
simply superb-
His eyes can pierce the heart
of the stone and see
And regarding diamond's and
other precious stones-
He says from the childhood he
hasn't filtered mud-
Has filtered only
pearls
I have given him a start
of Rs.10,000-
Let's see, how far
he grows?
Okay, how I'll
take leave
Will you not meet him
and go?
No, whatever I wanted to know,
I have known-
Vinay, the necklace which you had
bought yesterday-
How did it reach to
Mr. Commissioner?
Sir, Mr. Commissioner
is my father
Excuse me
is Shalu here?
What will she do
coming here?
Is everything
alright?
I can't say, in the night when
I woke up-
I saw that she was not
on her bed
Since yesterday she is behaving
very indifferent-
I am scared if she does
something stupid
I'll go, I'll search
for her.
And, when Dawn arises
On somebody's tears, It's not
good to laugh
I'll laugh, that's because a mere
dream made you cry
The one who see's
a dream-
Only that person can understand
the pain of it's breaking
When the dream breaks, then one
should open the eyes
To see. What,
the darkness
No, to see, that the night
is passing off-
The Dawn will
definitely arise
But still, the wound takes
time to get healed
If the remedy is given
it get's healed up faster
Have you come here
as a doctor?
For such wounds, instead of a doctor
a friend is required
See, how I
scared you?
When a guest is in the house, one
shouldn't look into the time
Come here,
sit closer to me-
Talk something romantic with me
The night will pass off
within a flick
Come on, leave
this room-
Otherwise tomorrow your daddy
will sack me from my job
It would be good, I'll make you
my secretary
What salary would
you charge?
Now, what will you take for
leaving from here
Will you give?
Look, you got
scared
Look, your coming here like this
is not at all good
That's because, you are a man
and I am a woman
For sometime, why don't you
forget on the fact-
Of you being a man and
me to be a woman
Even in the scriptures
it is written-
That the sout has
no sex
Learned person, shower your
grace on me-
Tomorrow it's sunday, the whole day
I'll do your slavery
But at this time, you better
leave this place
Alright, leave me
till the car
Come
I'll not get up
Then?
Then what carry me-
You...
No, this bed
Alright, come.
Is the weight more?
Till now
I am alive
Come, drop me till
my house
Till your house; and how will I
come back?
Take the car along
with you
In the morning anyway's you have to
come for slavery
Or have you forgotton
now itself-
Only if you make
me forget
Alright, get inside
I'll pack food in the lunch box
and tea in the flask
We'll take 2-4 bottles of beer
with us-
Let's make this picnic which we
never forget
Why?
For me
Only if you
accept it
I have no courage
to refuse it
Please come
But suddenly, how did you feel
that I am worthy of this?
You gave me the strength to
compete with the life-
In return, it's a very
small gift
Sit down
Can I open it
and see?
Definitely
You didn't like it
Miss. Shalini if you want to
make me Amar-
Then you are mistaken-
If you want to grow your
friendship with me-
Just because you find Amar
in me-
Then you can understand that how much
my self-respect will get hurt
If I give you the rememberance
of Amar-
Then I'll indeed feel happy
in staying away from you
But yes, If I can help you in
forgetting of Amar's rememberances-
Then you can consider me
as your friend
By mistake, I understood you
as my friend
Not Amar, But Vinay
You felt bad of my talk
and walked away
Not at all, I have no
such rights
Tell me, how do
I look?
Absolutely the same
Wait
Even this
just like that
Don't feel bad
But, on one condition
Tell me
I became Amar for
your happiness
For my happiness, you think me
to be just like Amar
Atleast for today,
agreed
Agreed
If Amar was there, had anybody
dared to overtake him like this
If we had met with an
accident, then?
What happened?
Last year, the aeroplane tragedy
that took place in Kashmir-
My mother and father
were in that
I couldn't even see their
dead bodies
Do you have any other
brother or sister?
There is only one brother, I am
alive only for him
Only for him
Your brother is
very good
Brother, we don't object on romance,
but in the middle of the road
Search for a better place
Okay tell me, the difference
between me and him?
There's no difference
at all-
But still, there's a lot
of difference
For example
For example
He had the same eyes-
But, when he used to
look at me, -
Something used to happen
within
He had the same voice
as yours-
But, when he used to speak-
Then something used to happen
within
He had the same style of
walking as yours-
But when he used
to walk-
Then something used to
happen within
He had the same lips
as yours
But when...
But when he used
to use it
Yes, when he used...
What do you mean?
Further...
And when he used to recite
a versification
He used to do versification
too
And, when he used
to sing in a tune
He also used to sing
Like he used to wassail
the world of love
Just let me hear any
of his poetry-
Let me also know what kind of
world he used to wassail
For example, he only
told this-
Beneath the sky.
Today we are back of us-
We have wassailed the
world of love-
We have made the prints
of our foot-steps
This looks like a cheap poetry
What do you mean by cheap-
What do you know about
versification
Why do you get angry
for this?
May be it sounds good
in a tune
I see... very good
What do I know-
Had I heard it, I could
have give my opinion
Nobody needs your
opinion
Your wish
Further...
Then,
Madam, This is a song
or a kawali
You anyway's look like
a funster
If you even sing a clasical song
it will look like a kawali
Ring...
The incident is of the
last year-
Those days I used to stay
in pune-
There was a theft which
took place in my house
The report of which is recorded
in that station
The jewels which had got theived
among those this ring was also there
The one whom you saw in
that girls finger
Yes.
Is there anybody?
Find out, where will Mr. Vishambar das
be available at this time
Shalu, just give me the ring?
Give a deep thought, and think
once again
Let me know,
What the matter is?
The thing is that this ring
is thevished
Shalu, was this also left to be
heard of Amar
Who is this Amar?
Mr. Commissioner...
Is this the time for a decent
man to come home-
Ask him, what he
wants?
Tell that, I have come to
return the car back
Take the keys
And tell, thankyou so much
for using the car
Ask him, what was
the hurry?
He could have used it for
Tell her, that I am feeling
very thirsty-
Will she ask for something to drink
or should I leave?
Ask him if he has come here
to quench his thirst-
Then what was he doing the
whole day with her?
Tell her that I was
increasing my thirst-
Now I have come
to quench it
He's come to
quench it
Has the thirst
got quenched?
Pour a little bit on
yourself too-
So that the fire of your anger
also gets extinguished
Why do you trouble me so much?
In reality if this Amar's face
is identical to my son-
Then to catch hold of him, should
not be of a difficult task
Meanwhile, you keep this
ring with you-
If required, you'll have to take
pains of coming to the station
Yes, definitely
Shalu, take it
Yes
Hear there are uncut diamonds
worth lakhs
Everynight the job of cutting
used to take place
But, from few days one of my
crafts man has fallen sick-
And the other has gone
on a holiday
Now you suggest me as to
what should I do?
Because, I cannot trust upon
a new person
Will you be able to
trust me?
Vinay, from today your salary
will be double
From tomorrow you can take
an off in the morning
Because this work will be done
in the night after the shop closes
From when are
you starting?
You tell me
Tomorrow by 9 'O' clock
I'll wait for you
outside the shop
The time is 8:30
So
I have to reach
by 9 'O' clock
Should I leave?
Your wish
I thought that you would tell me
to stop for some more time
Had I told, would you
have stopped?
Why don't you say once and, see it
for yourself
What will I do telling?
What ever I had to say
the destiny has told it
And what about that which
I have to say?
It's better if you
don't say
Is your name
Shalini?
Yes, tell me
This letter
Brother
Yes
Where is he?
Please come
Shalu, what's the matter?
Arey, we have to go to the party,
where is she going?
I don't know, one man had
brought a letter
What letter, just
read it
I immidietly want to meet you
come with this man
I am not waiting
in the car
That scowndrel has
again come
I don't know when this girl
will get matured?
She has again gone
to him
His intentions are
not good-
Otherwise, wouldn't he had
come into the house
Why did he call her
outside?
Go and stop her, otherwise she'll
again come into his trap
I'll change my clothes
and come
Leave me, leave me, brother...
leave me
My ring
The same ring
Did you see any of the
Rowdies face?
Okay I'll leave-
Otherwise sir would tell-
That I am late by one and a half
hour, on the very first day itself
Is sir in the house?
Come in
Is he angry with me?
His eyes were showing
the anger
Actually I got late
Sit down, I'll just
send him
Sir
You, here
Sir, I came here for appologising
I couldn't reach at the right time
What are you
blabbering?
For the last 2 hours you were
sitting with me and cutting diamonds
Just 10 minutes ago, I dropped you
outside and left-
Because you told me that I'll
work till the morning
Sir, what are you
talking?
For the last half-an-hour
I was here
Yes, daddy
BY 10:30 when I reached
the shop, the door was closed
I thought probably you had left
after waiting for a long
So, I took a taxi and straight away
came here
You are lying
It was 5 minutes to 9, and you
reached there
I told, Vinay you are
very puntual
You told me sir, how could I
come late on the very first day?
After which we had closed the
door from inside
Sir, I was not there
I was not there
IF you were not there, then
who was there?
I am ruined
Sir.
I am ruined
I am ruined
I am ruined
I'll call the doctor
Not the doctor
but police, police
He was seated there,
and I was hore
How did I know, that
he was Amar
Vishambar do you
remember-
That in your party myself and Anju
mistook Vinay to be Amar
Yes,
From the time Mr. Commissioner
has told-
That the ring given by Amar
was of thieved-
From then, my mind is only
pondering on Amar's movements
He used to avoid giving answers
for so many questions
For exemple, where does
the hail from? -
Who his parents were,
what work he does?
And the second thing was that he
never used to stick on to one place
Sometimes in Delhi, sometimes in Calcutta
sometimes in Bombay-
Sometimes here
sometimes there-
Suddenly he used to come, suddenly
he used to get disappeared
But there is no doubt that
now-a-days he is in Bombay
The moment he came
to know-
That the ring which he gave has
become the evidence of his theft-
He has sent rowdies to
attac on Shalu
Now Mr. Commissioner, you
yourself think
There were gold bangels, a costly
watch and a diamonds necklace
He didn't touch
on those-
He only snatched away
the ring
But why?
You mean to say, that this Amar
is the same jewel thief-
Whom we are in
search of
How can I tell
this?
May be he is the same,
may be not
Leave me, it's not
my fault
How long have you been here?
Who are you?
I am a small robber, I'll not
do it again
You are not a robber but you have
come here for hearing our talk-
Who has sent you here? Whom do you work for?
Tell me, otherwise I'll
strangle your neck
I'll tell, I'll tell, but leave my
neck, leave my neck
I am a poor man, I was
given money
How much money?
Who gave it
to you?
I didn't see his face, it was dark
there was a mask on his face
You know it,
you are lying
Tell, otherwise I'll
break your bones
My hand...
And if you tell me the truth, then
even I'll give you 100 rupees
First give it
First give the
answer.
His name
his name is Amar
Although his friends call him
by the name Prince
I have no relation
with him
I haven't met him till date,
his Girl friend has sent me here
Who Girl friend?
By the name Roman night club
those in a night club
On every sunday night the
Girl... who dances there...
Sir, the lift has gone till
the 5th floor
First, switch on
the light
Arey, yesterday how did you
forget your pipe?
Even I was thinking that where
did it get disappeared!
Darling, you make a drink,
I'll freshen up and come
Change your clothes
later
Not the clothes, I was
just changing my shoes
Come let's sit
outside
You haven't made
the drinks
Darling, take out some
ice pleace
Sir, What will you
take?
Madam, what ever you
give
Drink, and remember me
I'll sit and drink
and remember
Come
Drink
First you drink
The entire wearines vanishes
in your arms
Who could be at
this hour?
Did you send a telegram
from pune?
Let me see
In this it's written that you are
going to come to night 2 'O' clock
How did you come
early?
My intention was
this-
But after sending the telegram,
I thought
Why don't I reach a little
early to see you
Lier, come let's finish our drink,
and then we'll go to sleep
Please open the zip
Open it
Close your eyes.
