One of them has arrived.
Where's the other?
There he is
Just you get out of here, you dog!
After l'm through with you...
the police won't even know
whose corpse it is.
l'll make you pray for your death!
And death will be slow in coming.
l've seen a thousand men like you.
- You better run, man.
Shut up!
- He shuts up first.
You shut your mouth first, you cur!
- Shut up! Else you'll do solitary.
Why do they fight like dogs?
- Hush! lf they hear you...
they'll break your neck
once they're out of here.
But why do they fight like this?
- Destiny, l think.
Maybe they are long-lost brothers
from some lifetime in the past.
Maybe that's why destiny wants them
to come together in this act.
Whenever one of them goes thieving,
the other turns up.
No one here.
- Let's go back.
Money! Where's it coming from?
- Look! The two of them! Get them.
What's it?
- The two of them are back.
They would, in any case.
They're destined...
to live all their lives in jails
But they aren't abusing each other.
- Must've run out of stock
Not abusive...?
They really aren't doing it!
Doesn't look like...
they'll come together in this lifetime.
They'll end up killing each other.
But if they teamed up, they might
pull off the job, l couldn't.
What job?
- A kidnapping
The millionaire's son. Bittu.
He'd fetch 10, maybe 20 million.
Why isn't anyone else trying?
- Tough. l tried. Once.
l couldn't get my hands on the kid.
But l killed a guard on the run.
So here l am, serving life.
- Could l give it a try?
First give this a try
Yes?
- Can l ask a question?
What does this Mr. Seth do with
all that money?
He hires security for
his son's protection.
l don't want to play.
l won't.
Not until Daddy comes.
l'm not playing.
l'm angry with Daddy.
l'm not talking to you!
You've bored me.
Come on, let's talk.
- No! l won't talk.
You won't talk to your Daddy?
What happened, son?
What's wrong, Martha?
You promised him you'd go to
his school on parents' day.
Bittu missed you.
Everyone else's parents had come.
Oh, l forgot! Look son,
l'm very sorry. l was too busy.
And one day, you'll forget
your Bittu too.
Don't say that.
You're the only one l have, son.
And you're the only one
l have too, dad.
Don't leave me.
lt scares me.
l'll stay with you all this month.
l'll do no work, okay?
l want to be with my son...
- But sir...
Will you really stay with me, dad?
- That's right, son.
l'll play with you too.
Let's go visiting a
hill-station tomorrow.
The day after, dad.
l have a cricket match tomorrow.
You'll come to watch it, won't you?
You play a cricket match
and l don't even know about it!
Of course l'll watch you play!
But you must score a century.
- l haven't had any practice, dad.
We'll deal with that right now.
Go and get your kit.
A trunk call for you, sir
Yes? lsn't he coming?
The experts from London
aren't arriving.
Work on your plant will be delayed.
- Why aren't they coming?
Book a ticket for me on
a flight to London tomorrow.
No, l'm not going.
- But sir...
Call Barrister William
in Washington.
Ask him to leave for London
and deal with it.
Go on.
Fetch the bat, son.
Let's begin the
practice session.
Here we go...
get ready, everyone.
Daddy!
- Let me take off my coat.
l can't leave. At no cost!
Tell him that.
Let's get started.
Now look, Harish...
- Daddy!
lt's Barrister William, sir!
Must l come?
All right. l'll board the
next flight for London.
Are you leaving tomorrow, dad?
- Yes. l'll have to.
l know you find it lonely
without me.
But l can't help it.
Once our plant is ready,
we'll be famous in the country.
You will get a lot of respect.
You will play with money.
Money means a lot of power, son.
When you don't have money,...
even those who are close to you,
shy away from you.
And people love even strangers
who have the money.
l don't want these guards, dad.
They don't allow me to play.
They don't let me go out...
l'm scared of them.
No, son. lt's necessary for them
to stay with you.
They protect you from the devils
who want to kidnap you.
Who are they, dad?
All my boys are here, l see.
- Yes
l've summoned them from their dens.
Ask them to spread out
in the city.
l can't say where he will
take the child.
Just follow the instructions
l give.
Bring the kid to me when
you find the opportunity.
Okay? Go on.
Listen, boys...
l don't take no for an answer.
ls that clear?
- Yes.
What's the point in shutting
down all the dens...
and going hammer and tongs
for Mathur?
He once went hammer and tongs
for me, my boy.
l used to be a clerk in the company
where he was the manager.
l stole a hundred thousand
from the boss's safe.
l wanted to start
a gambling den.
The manager caught me.
l told him that l wasn't
stealing the money.
l was using the money because our
employer was away for 3 months.
l promised to put it back
before the boss returned.
But he played the honest man.
He handed me to the police.
He had shattered all my dreams.
And now, he has pinned
all his hopes on his son.
l will shatter his
dreams too.
Hurry up! Get the kid!
Leave me alone! Let me go!
Hurry! Quick!
Go in and take him with you.
Thanks for saving the kid.
Have you recognized them, Miss Shalu?
- Yes, l have.
Where will you escape from me?
ls this why l brought you up?
From those filthy gutters?
Your father and mother
had left you alone...
and it was l who
took care of you.
Pick up the gun and fire at me.
Pick it up, l say!
Thanks a lot, Miss Shalu.
Bittu means more than my life to me.
Why do you say such things?
Because of this incident,
l have found a friend.
Dad! She's so grown up...
how can she be my friend?
Why not? Come here!
We'll play together and
become good friends.
Will you play with me?
- Of course.
Did you find something?
Sorry, sir.
We found their dead bodies.
We cannot understand this.
Whenever we have recognized
the attackers...
they have been found dead
the next day.
There is someone very dangerous
behind all this.
Look... l've brought the ball.
Someone is targeting
the innocent child.
Could there be an enemy
trying to get even, sir?
My money is my enemy.
Let's play here.
- Let's play in the garden.
No. l'm scared of the guards there.
Aren't you scared of them?
- Why must l be scared?
l am. All the children in
my school are afraid of them.
This is why l don't
have any friends.
Do they accompany you
to the school also?
Yes, wherever l go.
Or the devil
will take me away.
Devil? Who says it
will take you away?
My father says so.
You will not touch the ball.
Haven't l told you?
Bittu... Go and get the ball.
l am your friend right?
Then go.
Get 20 more guards here.
What are you doing?
Bittu is already scared. And your
going to get more guards?
Then what am l supposed
to do?
l want to protect my child.
ln the process of saving your child,
you're being his enemy.
He'll die before anybody
else can finish him.
So what am l supposed to do?
l can't even think straight.
l am ready to give away
all my money,...
but no one should
take my child away.
He is my real wealth.
And my last hope for happiness.
Look friend, l have got the ball.
Dad, you said that there is a devil.
But l found no one there.
You went there alone?
Well done!
Now you are my brave friend.
No need to frighten him anymore.
Here's what l suggest we do.
is a boarding school.
l teach there.
No one comes there without permission.
Let him join our school.
Who can stop the criminals from
kidnapping my son from school?
Please trust me.
Nothing will happen.
l'll call the Principal tomorrow.
You can talk it over with him.
Where are they taking Bittu?
We know they don't tell you much.
But you can tell us this much.
We'll pay you 500,000.
No! l won't be a traitor!
No... don't do this!
l'll tell you!
Well done, my boy.
You've proved to be intelligent.
You deserve 500,000.
Sorry, sir, but no one can
be trusted in such affairs.
This is the hostel.
This is the wall of the compound.
And this road leads to the city.
Anyone could scale the wall.
No, no one can even
come near the gate
lt's guarded 24 hours.
Even otherwise, it's dangerous
to loiter around outside.
Well done.
Here is the money.
Now get rid of him.
You?
- Remember me?
Yes.
How much money is that?
- 500,000.
Whose is it?
- Yours.
This makes it 500,000
plus 5 Rupees.
How about uncle...?
- To hell with him!
Quit town... or uncle's
not going to spare you.
Now, only l know the secret.
Who is it?
Vijay! Come in.
Doing well, aren't you?
- The population explosion, you see.
Which leads to dishonesty.
People now know nothing about
hard work, they're all dishonest.
The double M.A. degree...
for Kamal.
He hasn't got beyond Class 7.
But he's a millionaire's son.
He's going to be happy
with a fake degree.
He's going to throw
his weight around.
He's not alone. Here's Niranjan,
who failed four times in Class 10.
He wants a First Class degree
in Bachelors of Science.
He has a rich man for
a brother-in-law...
he'll land a good job.
Alas! Those with genuine degrees
will go begging.
They'll bribe others
to land jobs.
Corruption and dishonesty is
what makes the world tick.
So be it.
Don't try to prevent it.
Now let's talk about my business.
Any news on the principal?
Yes, l've found a solution.
Look! This is the Principal.
And now listen to what l say.
The Principal's name
is Om Prakash Sharma.
He hails from Dhanakpur.
He used to have a close friend
Ranjit's wife was dead
and he had only a son, Ram.
Ranjit was called
to the battle front.
Before leaving, he handed his son
to his sister, Seema.
Since Ranjit died in war...
so the Principal decided to look
after the Colonel's son.
But his aunt Seema had gone to Canada
and taken the boy with her.
The Principal went there to find them.
But he didn't succeed.
The aunt's car met
with an accident.
The car fell in a gorge.
And nobody knows anything
about their fate.
So Ram died?
- Right.
And l've got to impersonate Ram.
Now where have l spent
You spent 6 years in Canada...
and then went to England
for education.
Later you returned to America
for 5 years for education, too.
You have now returned to lndia.
l've prepared all the
certificates and passports.
You have just to put
your signature on them.
You've done it for me.
Thanks!
But there's a problem.
- Problem?
The Principal has a
daughter named Anju...
two years younger than Ram.
She used to play with him as a child.
Ram must've been 8 years of age
then, and Anju was about 6.
She's now a young girl.
She's bound to meet you and bring up
stories of their childhood.
l can't help you in this case.
l don't know what
transpired between them.
No problem, l'll deal with it.
You've worked a miracle, uncle.
May you live to be 100.
Don't curse me, son.
l don't want to last long.
Be careful, Vijay...
lest you slip...
and then you won't know
how to save yourself.
Why bother about all that?
Help the blind to cross the road.
l'll help you across.
What is it?
- Uncle has sent for you.
l've just spent 6 months in prison.
What does he want me to do?
lt's an urgent job.
- He always has an urgent job.
But l'll go home first.
ls everything ready there?
- Of course!
Brother!
You have grown up in six months.
Mother...
She's a nice girl.
Brother!
What's the matter with him?
Nothing, my foot's slippery.
Be careful, lest you fall again.
Even the hospitals won't accept you.
Bring my stuff in.
My son!
- Mother!
My son!
You're shedding tears, mom...
You know l hate to see you cry.
There! She's crying too!
What is all this about?
You start crying when l arrive!
Not done! Certainly not!
Looks like Laxmi isn't
looking after you.
Now that l'm here,
everything will be okay.
You're crying too, son.
You have an appointment with
the Commissioner this evening.
l know. Go on.
l'll join you later.
Are you leaving again?
You have come home after
six months, my son.
And you're already
talking about leaving.
What can l do, mom?
People are driving me crazy
Know something?
Look at any newspaper of the
big countries of the world...
America, France, ltaly, Russia...
you'll find my pictures in them.
And each paper says,
''We Want Sunil!''
Are you in good health?
What's happened to my health?
Look at me!
l've become so fat.
l have just returned from Japan.
Thousands of people
came to see me off.
lt was amazing!
The president has sent
his regards to you.
Look what l've brought for you.
A first class sari!
lt's so beautiful.
This one's for you, Rashmi.
And this for you, mom.
lt's beautiful, isn't it?
Why are your hands so rough?
l've got to shake hands
with thousands of them.
What other reason
could there be?
All right. You're tired, aren't you?
l'll get you a cup of tea.
Yes, l'd love that!
Make it quick...
it's going to be fun.
Why are you crying?
What happened?
Tell me.
Why are you crying?
l place you under an oath...
say it.
Mom can't live
without you anymore.
She wakes up in the
middle of the night.
She has these nightmares...
that you're in trouble.
Nightmares that you are
being held captive...
and you can't escape.
Don't leave mom now, brother.
Oh no! D'you think l'm sending you
on a dangerous mission, young man?
Even your name will not appear.
Look! There's this school
You'll work there as
a music teacher.
l've already prepared your
fake certificates, degrees etc.
ls there a vacancy for the job?
- lt will be vacant tomorrow.
The teacher there is going to
meet with an accident.
He'll be bed-ridden
for a couple of months.
What if the mission is
not over within 2-3 months?
The rascal will die then.
Why are you worried?
No... no bloodshed.
- All right.
There won't be any blood shed.
But he can fall from the stairs.
Why are you getting worried?
Another thing!
There is this beautiful teacher
who's the guardian of the child.
Try and be friends with her.
You can flirt as well as
accomplish our mission.
Stop!
You cannot take Bittu away!
Stop! l'll shoot you!
Stop...
This man is a retired
army officer.
He has won many medals
for mountain-climbing...
as well as escaping
from enemies.
When this man could not
get past your guards...
how can anyone else
escape with your son?
The arrangements seem to be
good enough, Mr. Principal.
But there is a doubt in my mind.
There is a possibility of a
gangster impersonating a teacher.
Or what happens if a teacher
joins ranks with the gang?
You can count on me for that.
All our teachers here
come from decent families.
And new teachers are appointed
only if they are...
recommended by a former teacher
or by a big personality.
Since the former music teacher met
with an accident and is in hospital...
we have a new teacher.
This gentleman was recommended
by the former teacher himself.
Don't worry! ln a month, your leg
will be fine and you can go home.
Doctor... can you let me off
a bit early?
Will l have to stay here
a whole month...?
One month? lmpossible!
l can't get out of bed
for six months!
Don't worry!
You'll be all right in a month.
How can l get well?
Do you want me to get killed?
How can you cure me when
l am not going to get well?
You can't force me
to recover, can you?
My leg, after all. l can't
have it broken every other day.
Am l right?
- Yes, you are.
But the children will miss me.
Don't worry about that!
We have sent another teacher
to take your place.
What's all this about, mister?
There was close scrutiny at the
earlier gate. And you're at it too.
l am only going to
teach in the school.
l am not crossing the borders
and entering another country.
l asked you for the papers.
- Sure. Here you are
l'll be highly obliged
if you tell me...
what are all these measures for?
l'm an artist, you see.
A man of very gentle disposition.
All my life, l have
played my instruments.
But you've given me a jolt
by doing this check today.
lt's all right.
You may go.
Tell me something, mister...
will l always be checked like this
before going to the class?
Only the Principal will
conduct the interview.
l am delighted that a teacher
like you will work with us.
Although this is a temporary job...
l'll try and make it
permanent for you.
There are big and small
children in the school.
But looking at your
qualifications...
l want you to start teaching
the elder children first.
The younger children, sir.
l love small children.
Their vocal chords are tender...
like freshly planted saplings.
They can be molded
any which way we want to.
Well done. The class is over.
Perform the farewell.
Go on now.
So this the one who
will be my friend?
lt's a flower to put in
your hair.
No!
-No?
lt's for eating.
lt's good for the stomach.
You probably ate breakfast.
l didn't.
Friendship? She's not even
worthy of being an enemy.
We'll see.
Good morning sir.
-Good morning my millionaire.
What?
-l mean son.
l am your music teacher.
l have come to take you away.
l mean to teach you music.
Sir, can l go?
My gym teacher is calling me.
Let me introduce you.
This is the new
music teacher...
and he's the new
P.T. instructor.
This is a school;
not a den for thugs like you.
Try to kill me,
and you won't escape either.
That's just what l came
to you tell you, you cur.
Don't you dare disclose my secret.
You won't escape.
l'll show you, once l have
the kid in my hands.
Only time will tell whose
hands the kid will fall in.
l'm sorry you didn't win a cup
in the music contest yesterday.
But l can't sing, sir.
- Never mind. l'll teach you.
What am l here for?
l'll make a great musician
out of you.
People will look upon you
as a master of music.
l'll make you scale the dizzy
heights of success in music.
And people will say,
''There comes the Maestro Bittu''
What do you think?
Where's he?
This is how it goes... see?
Football has a lot
to do with your eyes.
You kick the ball, even as
you look at the other players.
You didn't win a cup in sports, right?
- Right.
l'll make you the captain
in football in just 6 months.
Now that's the goal there.
And here's the ball.
Keep your eyes on the goalkeeper,
and your feet on the ball.
Here goes... Goal!
Where is he?
Now listen, son.
There are seven notes
in music, okay?
Join me, when l sing.
Music isn't for tough men.
Football helps you build
a healthy body.
You must've heard of Pele?
l'll make such a champ out of you
that Pele will pale in comparison!
Now's that the ball...
A ball made of rock!
Football, my foot! They keep
kicking it around like asses!
Music is meant for the
blue blooded, son.
Musicians are revered by the world.
Let's practice now.
And you mustn't slip away, okay?
This is going to be fun...
An electric shock!
Bittu! Come here, son!
Let's learn football!
Be like Pele...
be a champ!
See that?
This exercise makes your neck
as thick as a rhinoceros'...
your chest like a bear's,
your blood like a lion's...
eyes like those of a bull and
a nose like that of an elephant.
But the trunk of an elephant
is very long!
Well said!
You will have a nose just like mine
after the exercise l show you now.
These are the parallel-bars.
Now look at the exercise l show you.
Watch the style, okay?
Who's responsible
for that mischief?
Speak up!
Or l'll punish all of you.
No, sir. Why punish them?
They're only children.
lt was my fault, not theirs.
l couldn't win over their hearts.
lt's all my fault, sir.
l deserve the punishment.
l will not eat today.
Let me eat...
For all you know, l might have to
pull off another stunt tomorrow.
Anything for a meal.
And now for some booze.
l know everything. You aren't eating
because your teacher is hungry!
This trick has misfired!
He's become a hero.
Our teacher will dine first;
only then will we eat.
Enough! My tummy's going to explode.
l can't eat anymore.
Not at all.
Who's that?
- Open the door, sir!
The children want to
apologize to you.
What's the problem?
What's happening here?
- Teacher, please forgive us.
Or we won't eat either.
- What !
You haven't had your food only
because your teacher is hungry?
You all may go now...
l have forgiven you.
Go and eat, or it will
break my heart.
Let's go...
- No! Wait a moment, children.
Apologize to your teacher and
feed him with your own hands.
No! l'll eat on my own!
Go on.
No. The teacher won't eat,
because he is angry.
l'm not angry, my son.
l swear, l'm not!
Don't make him take an oath...
Just feed him!
Every child will feed
the teacher a puri.
One puri each?!
- Right! One each.
Go on... keep it up!
Well done!
With all the love...
feed him.
Like this... one more.
Go on, children.
Not more than one, okay?
Good boys.
He's terribly hungry...
Feed him.
May you be ruined!
May worms feast on you!
lf l don't make you eat
all the food in the world...
l'm not Ram!
l'd rather starve all my life
than ever eat again!
l've got some food
for you, l say!
Where do l keep it?
- Go on... get out.
Get the hell out of here!
Music is the treasure
no thief can ever steal.
Music is magic. lt is more powerful
than every other spell.
Music makes stones melt.
lt brings estranged hearts together.
lt can light lamps and breathe life
into those who are dead!
l'm getting late for class.
Bye.
She seems to be pretty
cheerful today.
l must get cracking then.
Do you understand, children?
Well, never mind. l'll explain it
tomorrow. Class is dismissed.
l must attend to a
personal matter today.
''What favor has life shown me?''
''l can neither live...
nor die''
''Such is the sorrow
it has given me''
''What favor has life
shown to me?''
''l can neither live nor die;
such is the sorrow it has given me''
''l have lost everything l had''
''What do l possess?''
''Pain and agony;
a thirst that is not quenched''
''Only l know of the
poisons l have drunk''
''Neither do l live nor die...
such is the sorrow it has given me''
C'mon!
''Like those whose fires
are extinguished...''
''l was lit up again''
''This is how life
has treated me''
What is he up to?!
''Who has ever sought
life in death?''
''Neither does it let me live nor die;
such is the sorrow it has given me''
''l was loyal in love''
''And how have l been punished''
''How my friends have
let me down''
''l have sealed my lips.
l will speak of nothing''
''Neither can l live, nor die...
such is the grief l bear''
''What has my life ever given me?''
''Neither does it let me live nor die;
such is the sorrow it has given me''
May l ask you a question?
Why are you so sad?
What will you do if you know?
My wound has turned dangerous.
He has started acting!
And whoever helps those
who suffer?
You can tell me.
lt's about Sarla.
- Sarla?
Sarla? Now where did
Sarla spring from?
We met in the valleys of Kashmir
and were drawn to each other.
l looked into her eyes,
and she into mine.
lt started snowing...
And l held her hand!
He has grabbed her hand!
Our bodies were on fire...
She tried to free her hand.
l drew her closer
and embraced her...
and she started crying bitterly!
She said, ''l love You, Laxman;
l can't live without you''
What happened then?
Go on, you dog!
What happened then?
And then, we didn't even
know how the days passed.
Stories of our love
were all over Kashmir.
Must've been your old man!
Well then?
And then, l don't know what
evil-eye cast a spell on our love.
She left me abruptly.
She walked out, without a word.
On whose shoulder
do l cry now?
Where do l go?
Loneliness and tears will not
drive your sorrows away.
So what am l to do?
- l'll tell you.
Just get ready.
- Ready?
Yes. l'm going shopping.
Come along and help me.
Shopping in the city?
Get ready, Bittu!
That cur has done it!
l must think of something too.
Or else...
The principal has sent for you.
Have you sent for me, Sir?
A surprise for you..
You were her childhood-friend.
That's my daughter, Anju!
Anju will surely
come to meet you....
and she'll talk about
your childhood days.
l can't help you here.
Anju! You have grown up so much!
You are beautiful and...
Never mind. You have been very cruel.
- What have l done?
You disappeared when you were a kid.
And you meet me when you've grown up!
l have at least reappeared.
Not anyone else in my shoes.
Why not?
- Dad will answer that. Not me.
lf you ask again, l'll disappear now
and reappear when l'm an old man.
l won't. But l did
miss you so much!
Did you meet any of our
childhood friends?
A couple of them, all right.
- Did you meet Yousuf?
Yousuf? He went away
to France, didn't he?
And Deepak went away to America.
Did you meet him then?
Wasn't Deepak with Suresh?
- Who is Suresh?
The one we used to snatch
the sweets from.
How about Jimmy?
Ever run into him?
He's roaming the streets
of Paris with Suresh.
Now who's Suresh?
l can't remember.
That fat, rolly-polly chap...?
Remember?
Where have you been all these days?
- With Suresh.
Suresh again.
Why didn't you write me?
l was about to but Suresh said to
wait until l became someone.
Who?
-Suresh.
Who is Suresh?
-Okay. l should go. l left class.
Okay Anju. l'll meet you
after class.
Daddy who is this Suresh?
-Probably on of your childhood friends.
The piano is not working.
Could you please send it
to the city for repairs?
The children's classes
are suffering, you know?
l'll send it right away.
A plan to kidnap Bittu under the
pretext of getting the piano fixed?
Where are they taking Bittu?
You look very beautiful.
You'll see when all
my dresses are here.
Your dresses?
- l'm going to get them from the city.
To the city, l see!
Are you going downtown?
Don't go.
Suresh's fiancee
went downtown once.
Suresh?
- Our friend... remember?
Her clothes were snatched
on her way to town.
And she remained in the same
set of clothes for 16 days!
Wasn't she stinking?!
Their engagement broke.
May l join you?
- Really? But...
l hate it when someone
fools around with girls.
Laxman shouldn't have
done that to Shalu.
What has he done?
- He wagered a bet with me...
that he'd seduce Shalu
with his charms. And he did.
Laxman is a fraud
when it comes to girls.
He pretends as if he's
undergoing great sorrow...
and the girls fall for him.
- That's very bad.
Back in Meerut, he won 300 bucks
from me. For a girl called Laxmi.
She still rues the
day she met him.
ln Delhi, he won 200 bucks
over a girl called Ranjita.
She packed her bags and went
to the railway station for him.
She hasn't yet returned.
And there is Susheela in Bombay.
A married woman with 2 kids.
He entrapped her too!
Her husband would have divorced her
if l didn't get there on time.
l asked him to forgive her
because it was all part of a bet.
What a disgusting man!
- Just disgusting?
You wouldn't even utter his name
if you heard the whole story!
ln any case, he will reap as he sows.
Why must l bad-mouth him?
Go and take that bath.
l'll go and say my prayers.
l must pray after talking
about such a dirty man.
Sorry, Bittu. But l must render you
unconscious to dump you in the piano.
How about the piano?
Later. Let's bathe
in the river first.
Because its waters are sacred.
Anyone who bathes in it
gets rid of his sorrow...
and his wishes are
fulfilled too.
The water must be terribly cold.
And we have no swim-suits either.
- l'm here with you.
Let me turn my face away.
You can take off your clothes
and take a plunge.
Very well.
C'mon!
My foot!
- What does that mean?
You tried to fool me
with a false love-story!
What are you talking about?
- Really?
You laid a bet with Ram
that you'd seduce me.
That you'd make a fool out of me.
You can rot in that water
all your life now!
That's not true!
My clothes! How will
l reach the hostel like this?
Ram! The bloody swine!
Here is where the
great musician bathes!
Bastard! Fight me like a man!
Why land me in the waters?
Like a man, eh?
You made a 150-odd kids feed me...
that was manliness, was it?
Stay in that water for 150 days!
Try to get out and l'll have posters
printed with you in the nude!
l was going to the city anyway,
to have that piano repaired.
You...?
C'mon... come on out!
There come the kids.
They couldn't have seen
a teacher like you.
Must l call them?
- No!
No? So take a dip!
No!
Go on!
What if they find
Bittu in the piano?
What's in the truck?
- What's in it?
lt's a piano.
We are taking it for repairs.
The city... we must go there.
- ln a hurry. Please let us pass.
Sir... what was that...?
- A piano they're taking for repairs.
We have the principal's
daughter as witness.
Suresh has proved to be good friend.
- Who's that?
You keep forgetting,
don't you?
Want me to show you
something more about him?
Just catch up with
that truck ahead.
Ram, my friend.
You win.
You could instigate Shalu
into hating me.
He really hates me now.
For the first time in my life,
l had found a friend.
She was a ray of hope.
You have deprived me of her.
Very well. Best of luck to you.
There's nothing here for me now.
l'm going away...
l couldn't ever imagine
that you'd be such a liar!
lf a teacher lies like this...
what will the children do?
But...
Your resignation?
- Yes. l'm leaving.
No! You will not go away!
lt was he who lied to me!
How am l to blame?
l...
l'm terribly sorry to
have offended you.
Please don't cry.
You won't go away, will you?
- No.
You must come to the
campfire today and sing for us.
For the children.
l will surely come.
And will sing, too.
You'll sing, eh?
C'mon... let me hear you sing.
God Almighty! You always
straighten things out!
Keep doing it and my job
will be accomplished.
Mr. Laxman will
now sing a song.
Wasn't he rather snobbish?
- The music teacher. No joking matter.
And now, children...
l will...
What's up, Laxman?
- My voice!
My voice is choked!
What can l do?
The emperor of music!
You haven't drunk
something wrong, have you?
Like a harmful betel-leaf...
it flattens your vocal cords.
Here... point this finger here.
Because l have a
remedy for everything.
You haven't known me yet.
Nor recognized my worth.
''You haven't known me yet;
nor recognized my worth''
''The world is crazy about me;
they follow me around...''

Lost in thoughts, aren't you?
Going to meet the giraffe?
- Well?
Don't mess with the giraffe...
he's not going to bow.
All right. Go ahead.
Why must l bother?
But remember... he's stingy
when it comes to his heart.
How are you concerned with that?
- Not at all.
Forget loving you. He won't even
offer you a glass of water.
You?
Yes, it's me.
At this hour...?
Any work with me?
Can't l see you without any work?
- Sure, you can.
But it's pretty late in the night.
And... l'm feeling sleepy.
We'll have a chat in the morning.
Shall we say ''good night'' then?
This way, please...
What people say is true.
Forget love, you wouldn't even
offer me a glass of water!
Which bastard wouldn't...?
l mean, why not? l could
give you a jug full of water!
So give it to me.
- At once!
Here you are.
Gulp it down.
Who says l'm stingy?
Want some more?
- No thank you.
That's enough.
- Good. Give that to me.
People will talk, you know.
They're jealous...
Now where is she?
Has she gone out?
Here she is!
She has passed out!
Could it be the water...?
A sedative!
lt must be that scoundrel!
What am l going to do?
Yes, l'll drop her home.
That's it.
Come... let me take you home.
Steady... slowly.

l couldn't even imagine
you would stoop so much!
This is as if you have
slapped me in the face!
You have brought your lineage to
shame with what you have done!
What happens when people get to know
that she spent a night with you...?
l feel like handing you
over to the police.
No!
Police?
lf you feel that l'm a criminal
then l will leave myself.
Today and now.
What happened?
-The principle fired Ram.
Ram? Ram who?
The gym teacher.
Gym teacher?
-Yes.
The one who teaches little kids?
-Yes.
So you must have found a
fault in him.
No! That can't be!
There has to be a mistake.
He looks so innocent.
Who are we to decide?
We're teachers; not lawyers.
The bell has rung. The children
must be waiting for you.
l must not waste time now.
What have you done, sir?
How could you dismiss
an innocent teacher?
l know what you'll say.
Just that your daughter spent
the night with him, isn't it?
Which father would allow
such a thing?
