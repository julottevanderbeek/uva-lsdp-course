There's a boy I know
He's the one I dream of
Ooh
Looks into my eyes
Takes me to the clouds above
Mm-hmm
Oh, I lose control
Ooh
Can't seem to get enough
Uh-huh
When I wake from dreaming
Ooh
Tell me is it really love?
Uh-huh
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know
if he really loves me?
I say a prayer
with every heartbeat
I fall in love
whenever we meet
This love is strong
Why do I feel weak?
Oh, wake me
I'm shaking
Ooh...
I wish I had you near me now
Uh-huh
Said there's no mistaking
Ooh...
What I feel is really love
Uh-huh
Ooh, tell me
If he loves me
If he loves me
If he loves me not
Oh, yeah
If he loves me
If he loves me
If he loves me not
Oh, how will I know?
How will I know
if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone,
but I'm too shy
Falling in love
This love is strong
How will I know?
How will I know
If he really loves me?
How will I know?
Hey, how will I know?
With every heartbeat
How will I know?
Ooh, how will I know?
I fall in love
whenever we meet
How will I know?
Yeah, how will I know?
I'm asking you
'Cause you know
about these things
How will I know? Yeah
How will I know?
I'm just surprised
they're taking this so hard.
I mean, don't
get me wrong--
I will always love Whitney, too,
but you'd think,
after two months,
they'd let it go.
I got this.
Is this you?
Mm-hmm.
August 31, 1997.
I was about to start
my senior year of high school
when tragedy struck.
I spent the next
eight months
writing condolence letters
to the two princes
and listening to "Candle
in the Wind" on constant repeat.
Emma, I had no idea you had
such a connection to her.
I didn't.
I mean, every little girl
worshiped her,
but she was just a physical
representation of my pain.
You know, I was scared.
It was my last year
of high school.
No more living at home.
I was saying good-bye
to my teachers and my friend.
Diana dying represented
the loss of my childhood.
So Whitney is their Diana.
Yeah, exactly.
MERCEDES:
It was written for Diana Ross.
No, Mercedes,
you are wrong, okay?
The Bodyguard was originally
written for Barbra Streisand.
Actually, Rachel, it was
supposed to be Diana Ross--
and Steve McQueen,
back in the '70s.
Thank you, Mr. Shue.
I've been doing some research
to prepare
for this week's lesson.
Oh, my God, yes.
It's about time we did
a Whitney tribute!
Are we sure
that's appropriate?
You did not just ask that.
I just mean,
didn't Whitney
kind of have
a lot of problems?
She had a hard life, Sam. And?
Look, this week isn't about
passing judgment on Whitney.
It's about celebrating
her legacy,
honoring her memory,
her accomplishments.
Which I will happily list
for you.
But I also
want you guys
to use her songs
to get underneath
your own feelings.
To express and explore
what's really going on with you.
I don't get it, Mr. Shue.
What's really going on with us?
Well, for most of you,
these next few weeks
will be your last
here at McKinley.
Lots of changes
coming up, lots of...
saying good-bye.
To your friends,
to your
significant others,
to the last four years
of your life.
For a young person,
all that transition
can be overwhelming.
So it's easier to focus
on other things.
Like not being able to say
good-bye to Whitney Houston.
What are you talking about?
Santana, it's okay.
I get it.
You're hanging
on to Whitney
because it's difficult to handle
the upheaval in your own lives.
We're hanging on to Whitney
because she was incredible
and we love her, so don't
put your baggage on us.
RACHEL:
You guys, Mr. Shue's
attempt to understand us,
though misguided,
doesn't matter.
What matters is that I start
rehearsing Whitney's version
of "The Star-Spangled Banner"
immediately.
It is the Mount Everest
of anthems.
KURT:
How thrilled am I
for this week's assignment?
I'm going to Between the Sheets
to find music.
I got to figure out
what song I want to do.
I could do
"So Emotional,"
which was obviously
written for me,
or "One Moment in Time,"
which was also obviously
written for me.
Well, you can't
really go wrong.
I figured I could kill two birds
with one stone.
I could do one
for the assignment this week,
and then one
for my NYADA audition.
You'll come
with me, right?
Well, I can't today.
Okay. Boo.
Well, just text me
when you're done.
Will do.
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry
to bother you,
but that
hippopotamus head brooch
is awesome.
Thanks.
That whole outfit
is amazing.
You must get compliments
all the time.
I don't, actually.
Kurt Hummel.
Chandler Kiehl.
I go to North Lima High.
I've got an audition next week,
and I'm dying to do
"Rainbow High" from Evita,
but the guy
just said
they're sold out,
which is a preposterous lie.
What are you auditioning for?
Uh, the musical theater
program at NYU.
That's so funny.
I'm auditioning for NYADA.
My callback's in
a couple weeks.
NYADA callback?
Ooh-la-la!
What song are you doing?
I'm not sure.
Um, I have to find the perfect
Whitney Houston song.
Oh, my God! You must do
"One Moment in Time."
Whitney's performance
at the '89 Grammys was legend,
and no one has done
that song justice since.
But then again, there's also
"All the Man That I Need."
Oh, my God!
That song is amazing!
You-you must do it.
Finally, a love song
where it didn't have to hurt
to turn out right.
Sorry. Am I being really loud?
When I get excited,
I tend to start yelling.
No, no. You're just
really enthusiastic.
It's refreshing.
Infectious, actually.
Then I should quit
while I'm ahead.
Nice to meet you,
Kurt Hummel.
I'm sure you'll nail
whatever song you pick.
Thank you.
Oh, and good luck
with your NYADA callback.
Let me know if I can be
of any help.
:
We future New Yorkers
got to stick together.
Can I get your number?
Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time
to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done all right
up till now
It's the light of day
that shows me how
And when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh, I wanna dance
with somebody
I wanna feel
the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance
with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance
with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
Yeah, I wanna dance
with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Somebody who, somebody who
Somebody who loves me
Somebody who, somebody who
To hold me in her arms, oh
I need a woman
who'll take a chance
On a love that burns
hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh, I wanna dance
with somebody
I wanna feel
the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance
with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Come on, baby
Dance
Now get with this
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Don't you wanna dance?
Say you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance?
Don't you wanna dance?
Say you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance?
Don't you wanna dance?
Say you wanna dance
Oh, oh
With somebody who loves me.
Obviously, I like dancing
with Santana best,
but you guys are all
still cool dancers.
And Quinn, you're still
dancing in my dreams.
And you can fly
and breathe fire.
+
JOE:
Quinn... you okay?
You looked kind of bummed
out back there.
I'm fine.
How's your physical
therapy going?
I keep going,
and nothing seems
to be happening,
so it's pretty depressing.
Well, what if I went
with you next time?
That would definitely
be less depressing.
You really don't have
to go with me.
I want to.
You want to come with me? Why?
I care about you.
And, to me, being a
Christian isn't about talk.
It's about actions.
Come on.
I'll let you hold one
of my dreads for luck.
I've got a little surprise
for you.
Okay, if this is another
Rihanna song in the pool,
I have to take
pictures this time.
I...
Mademoiselle Pillsbury?
Mm-hmm.
What is this?
"I Do's Done Right Wedding
Planning by Mr. Lavender."
Mr. Lavender.
Northwestern Ohio's
premier wedding planner.
I booked him for us.
I'm getting
a pretty decent tax refund.
And I sold some blood platelets.
This is absolutely
wonderful,
but, um, I'm not so
sure that we need him.
You know, I mean, since
we're having the wedding
at Christmas,
the-the church
is already going
to be decorated.
I was going to put the
champagne fountain
near the manger,
the cake near the...
I want to move the wedding up--
to May.
May-- that's...
that's next month.
:
Uh-huh.
Is this about S-E-X?
This is about us.
Emma, we've been in love
for almost three years.
There's no reason we should
wait seven more months.
Except for the fact that wedding
planning takes so much time.
It takes so
much time.
I mean, I just started
decorating our
personalized nut cups, and I'm
only on the fifth one and...
I guess we can let Mr.
Lavender worry about the...
Okay.
Okay?
All right.
Okay?
Okay.
Oh, my God, I've been practicing
Whitney Houston's version
of "The Star Spangled
Banner" all night,
and I still
can't sing it.
You're just
realizing this now?
I'm surprised
anyone's attempted it
after she nailed it
to the wall.
Oh, I know
what that is.
Finn sends me cutsie text
messages all the time.
Usually, they're
puns about my boobs,
but I still
appreciate the effort.
It's not from Blaine.
Th-Then who is it?
He's just a guy.
I met him at
Between the Sheets.
Oh.
His name is Chandler.
He's-he's nice.
And what did Mr. Between
the Sheets say then?
Nothing.
We just joke around.
It's sweet.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, all right.
Um...
"Are you an astronaut?
Because your smile
is out of this world."
Oh! Are you
kidding me?
Kurt, you have been going at
this with him for two days now?
It's nothing.
It's-it's just fun.
He makes me feel good.
Blaine is supposed to
make you feel good.
You said that Finn sends you
cute text messages every day?
Does he compliment you?
Constantly trying
to get in your pants?
Yeah, he's an
Have you ever heard of
lesbian bed death?
No.
I read about it online.
It's when two lesbians
date for long enough,
they become like sisters.
Oh.
And Blaine and I are like
an old married couple--
a fabulous old married couple,
like Paul Newman
and Joanne Woodward.
But I don't think
we've had an unscheduled
make-out session in,
like, a month.
You schedule
make-out sessions?
The point is: I love Blaine
and-and Blaine loves me,
but he doesn't exactly
make me blush
with his texts right now.
W-What's the harm of someone
making me feel special
if it's all innocent?
Okay.
Would you show Blaine
those text messages?
Of course not.
Oh, well, then I guess
it's not that innocent.
Hey, some great Whitney songs
so far
this week, guys.
I'm really proud of the way
you guys have been
conjuring up the emotions
you feel towards her as we begin
to move on and say good-bye.
Mr. Shue, I've been
going with Quinn
to her rehab
this week.
We started working
on a Whitney song together
that we'd like to share.
Not sure how
it's gonna help
anyone say good-bye, but it's
a song we both really dig.
A few stolen moments
Is all that we share
You've got your family
And they need you there
Though I've tried to resist
Being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love
for you
It's not very easy
Living all alone
My friends try and tell me
Find a man of your own
But each time I try
I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home
feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love
for you...
No other woman
Is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night
That I'm feeling all right
We'll be making love
the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah, I'm saving
all my lovin'
Yes, I'm saving
all my love for you...
For you...
For you.
+
I don't know
why I like it, ha
I just do
Ooh, ooh
Hee
I've been hearing
your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photograph
beside my bed
Living in a world
of fantasies
I can't get you
out of my head
I've been waiting for
the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me
feel so good?
I got a love of my own, baby
I shouldn't get
so hung up on you
I remember the way
that we touched
I wish I didn't
like it so much
Oh
I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what
love can do?
Ain't it shocking
what love can do?
Ain't it shocking what
love can do?
Hee
I gotta watch you
walk in the room, baby
I gotta watch
you walk out, mm-hmm
I like the animal way
you move
And when you talk,
I just watch your mouth
Oh, I remember the way
that we touched
I wish I didn't
like it so much
No, no, no
I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what
love can do?
I get so emotional...
Oh, baby
Ain't it shocking what
love can do?
Oh, oh, yeah.
Quinn, when you sang
"Saving All My Love For You"
with Joe yesterday,
it sure felt like you meant it.
You guys seemed like a lot more
than just singing partners.
I don't know, Joe's
really pretty,
but I heard she doesn't
shave her armpits.
Joe and I are
just friends.
Nothing else is
gonna happen.
But you want it to,
don't you?
Doesn't matter
what I want.
I've said good-bye to
that part of my life.
Joe took me to rehab
the other day, we had a moment,
and before we kissed,
he pulled away.
Grossed out by me and my chair.
Quinn, I'm-I'm so sorry.
I don't want to hear that tone.
Joe's not into me.
I don't blame him.
Who would be?
Tsk.
Oh, hey.
Will, honey.
Um, Will, this is...
Mr. La-vender,
the wedding planner.
It's La-ven-der.
Richard Lavender.
It's a family name.
Oh. Wow.
You are not
what I was expecting.
Look, we are having
such exciting ideas.
Citrus and Wasabi
are your colors.
Wasabi is the
new sea foam.
Nice. I...
Right.
And did you know that we can
get these little handy wipes
with our names embossed
on the wrappers?
This sounds great.
Couple things.
At the reception,
I will be rapping.
And we're gonna need
a pretty big stage,
'cause the Glee kids
are gonna perform, too.
I've checked all the available
venues for your dates,
and none of them will
accommodate a stage.
Well, let's keep looking.
Okay, sweetie,
look, I know that
you really want to have
this wedding soon,
I just can't imagine how
we're gonna get all this
done in time.
Mr. Lavender has
recommended that
maybe we look at dates
in September or October.
We're not moving the date.
Okay.
I'm a wedding planner,
not a miracle worker.
I need more time.
You know what? Forget it.
Will, okay, wait...
We can do this ourselves.
We are getting married in May,
just like we agreed.
Thank you for your time.
You want to lift?
Actually wanted to talk to you
about Quinn.
You dig her.
Yeah, I can tell.
Everyone can.
I think she's into you, too.
Seriously?
How do you know?
I used to date her.
So, when you dated her,
how did you handle
your... feelings?
Here's the thing about me:
I can be super helpful,
but when you ask me stuff,
you have to be real specific.
When I was with Quinn
at her rehab,
I was having...
feelings.
You mean like "in
your pants" feelings?
I've been homeschooled
my whole life.
It was a lot easier
to resist temptation
when there were
no girls around.
Yeah, I gave up on that.
I had sex last year.
I mean, I was working
in a strip club, so...
But it's a sin. We're supposed
to wait until we're married.
And we're not supposed to
get tattoos-- Leviticus.
Look, when the Bible was
written, things were easier.
I mean, there
was no Internet,
chicks didn't wear short
skirts or anything.
I'm a good Christian,
but there's just
no way a dude's gonna
be able to resist.
I say, let's be a new kind
of Christian, one that
prays and does right by
people but understands
that some of those rules
are kind of old school.
The sex rule makes sense.
It's about
respecting your body,
putting the spiritual
over the physical
so you can feel
closer to God.
Okay.
All I know is
Quinn's a great girl, but
you're gonna have to decide
if you want to get closer to God
or get closer to her.
Hey, I got the cheese plate.
Our Being Bobby Brown marathon
can officially begin.
Who's Chandler?
Why are you going
through my phone?
I'm not going
through your phone.
It's just that
it keeps buzzing
because Chandler won't
stop texting you.
"When we go to New York,
let's go to the front
of the Plaza and reenact
the end of The Way We Were."
Give me that.
"Can you sing
into my voicemail?
I want to make your
voice my ringtone."
Give me my phone.
There are literally dozens of
texts between the two of you.
Do you know how many times
you've texted me
in the past two days?
Four.
And three of them
were about finding
peach-colored shoe polish.
Why are you
getting so upset?
This is, this is all innocent.
This is cheating, Kurt.
This is texting.
Okay, he is
just a guy
that I met at the music store.
Nothing happened.
You used to text
Sebastian all the time.
You would call
him, even.
But I didn't like him,
and all of those texts
were family friendly.
You like this guy.
I like the way
he makes me feel.
I mean, when was
the last time
that you complimented me
or told me how special I was?
I transferred schools
to be with you!
:
I, I changed
my whole life!
That doesn't
make you feel loved?
You don't know what it's like
being your boyfriend, okay?
You are the alpha gay!
Even Rachel wanted
to make out with you.
I used to get solos
every week.
And do you know how many times
I've had to sit on a stool
and watch you perform?
Then talk to me.
Tell me that you're unhappy,
but don't cheat on me.
I feel like I have
taken crazy pills!
I didn't cheat on you!
I'm, I'm really sorry
if this made you upset,
but it's, it's, it's okay.
It's not right...
but it's okay.
This song is for anyone
that's ever been cheated on.
This is insane.
I didn't cheat on you!
Cheetahs have the fastest
land speed of any living animal.
Friday night, you and your
boys went out to eat
Uh-uh-uh-uh
Then they hung out,
but you came home around 3:00
Yes, you did
If six of ya'll went out, uh
Then four of you
were really cheap
'Cause only two of you
had dinner
I found your
credit card receipt
It's not right,
but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come
running back to me
It's not right,
but it's okay,
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you,
leave your key
I'd rather be alone
than unhappy
I've been
through all this before
I've been through
all this before
I said yeah-yeah-yeah-
yeah-yeah, yeah
Don't turn around
to see my face
Don't you turn around
There's no more tears left
here for you to see
Was it really worth
you going out like that?
Tell me
You were making
a fool of me, yeah
Uh, uh, yeah
Uh
It's not right
It's not right
But it's okay
It's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
I'm gonna, I'm gonna,
hey-ey-ey-ey
Pack your bags up and leave
Close the door
and leave your key
I'd rather be alone
than not happy
It's not right
It's not right
It's okay
It's okay, baby
I'm gonna make it anyway
I can pay my own way
Close the door behind you
Ain't my life over
Leave your key
Take care of my business
I'd rather be alone
than not happy
Oh, oh, whoa-oh!
GIRL:
Whoo!
Snap.
+
Hi.
Hi.
You know, you can learn a lot
about a person
by looking into their locker.
Are you, like, stalking me?
You know we blew it, right?
We wasted three years going
at each other's throats
when we could have
been singing together,
killing it in Glee Club.
We hated each other.
Actually, I hated you.
Sorry. Yes, our duet in Glee
was a whole truckload
of awesome.
And who cares that it
took three years?
I mean, we still have plenty
of time to do it again.
We have 42 days ft
until graduation.
Half of that's gonna be
prepping for Nationals.
That was it.
Oh, crap. I think
I just realized
gonna miss you.
Oh, God, say something
irritating so I can get
the taste of this out
of my head, please.
It's okay. Look...
you went out of your way
to make my life a living hell
for three years,
but at the end
of the day, I know
that you respect
my talent and my ambition.
I like it when
you sing, and hey,
you're the only other person
at this school besides me
who's willing to kill
their best friend
to get to the top.
Yeah.
Will you do me a favor?
Will you put this up
in your locker?
You want me to put up a picture
of you in my locker?
Okay, we may not be able
to sing together,
but we have 42 days left
to at least be friends.
I'm gonna give you a hug.
It'll be quick.
I'll see you in Glee Club.
BURT: Hey, what's up?
What's with all
the stickers?
I'm triaging all my things
for my departure to New York.
Pink is for stay,
blue is for go,
red is for trash
and green is for humidity-
controlled storage to keep in
mint condition
to sell as
memorabilia after I get famous.
Well, what if I want to keep
some of this stuff?
You can go through
my leftovers.
You're not taking this with you?
Blaine and I are on the rocks.
I honestly don't know
what's up with him.
But with that said,
I do reserve
the right to
re-Post-it later.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
This isn't garbage.
Dad, it's a certificate
of participation for Regionals.
The one that we lost.
Come on. We have to be heartless
about this stuff.
You've seen Hoarders.
This is how it starts.
I'd like to keep it.
Dad, don't be
sentimental on me.
Well, no, screw that.
We haven't been getting
sentimental enough, okay?
The both of us, we've been way
too casual about this.
Do you realize that
we haven't had
our Friday night dinner
for three weeks?
You've been in D.C.
You think I couldn't get
an earlier flight?
Most of the other congressman
are gone on Thursday night.
Okay, I don't get it. So why
have you been skipping dinner?
Because I don't want you to go!
You know, you and me,
we've been doing this dance
for over a decade.
You know, Starsky and gay Hutch.
Everybody warned me
that when you were eight,
and you were bugging
the crap out of me that
one day I'd be begging for you
to wake me up at 4:00 a.m.
with a nightmare
or, you know,
wreck the kitchen,
playing restaurant.
I was nine.
Who knew paella was
gonna be so complicated?
So you've been skipping dinners
because you're sad
there's not gonna be any more
dinners? I'm confused.
Ah, you don't get it yet.
You know,
I know you got a taste of it
when you lost your mom,
but it's just like the older
you get, you just see.
It's just, none of it lasts.
Yes, you and I will
always love each other,
and you and I will always
be there for each other,
but, you know, as soon
as you walk out our door
towards New York,
everything's
gonna change.
And it won't change back.
Not to the way it is now.
Listen, I am so happy for you.
Kurt, really,
I am so happy
and I am so proud.
You know, you and me, we, uh,
we made each other men.
Yeah.
Just sometimes I just, I want
my sweet little boy back.
:
I'm gonna miss you, Kurt.
A lot.
I'm gonna to miss you, too, Dad.

I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there?
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing,
nothing...
Don't make me close
one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there?
Don't walk away from me, no
Don't walk away from me
Don't you dare walk away
from me
I have nothing, nothing,
nothing...
If I don't have you
You-you-you
If I don't have you
Oh, oh-oh-oh.

Okay, bros, here you go.
I was inspired
by the goodie bags
they give out
at the end of
birthday parties.
Thought I'd try it.
A little something from
the Puckster to all of you.
Sorry, Finn, I tried to
get your balls back from Rachel,
but she's got those on lockdown.
Guitar pick. Sweet.
And a shot glass that says
"Dinosaurs on Ice."
Why does mine say,
"Drink till she's cute"?
Had the picks inscribed with
"The Dudes of Glee 2012".
Shot glasses all say different
things 'cause I jacked them
from houses
I clean pools at.
Thanks, man.
What's this for?
The clock's ticking,
the time's coming
when we're all gonna
have to say adios.
Some of us, forever.
I want to make sure you guys
remember all the broments
that we had together,
and the great things
we accomplished, forever.
I know I haven't always been
the perfect friend or teammate,
but you've stuck by me,
forgiven me
for sleeping with your women.
Not everyone in my life
has done that.
One cougar's husband even
chased me around with a gun.
Anyways...
I'm only gonna say this once...
...but I'm going to
miss all of you.
I love you guys.
Cheers.
Cheers.
I'm a little confused as to
what we're doing here.
Well, um, Kurt said
that you two might need
a little couple's counseling.
Are you qualified for that?
Not really. Or at all.
But Sam and Mercedes
came to talk to me,
and you know, I-I think they
found it pretty helpful.
Yeah, I'm-I'm pretty
sure they broke up.
Gosh, they seemed like
such a good fit, too, right?
Brutal honesty is the
cornerstone of any relationship.
I want you to feel like
this is a safe space for you
to air your differences.
BLAINE:
Okay.
Well, uh, first...
Kurt has been
texting this guy,
and I got really upset.
Although, a while back,
I was sort of doing
the same thing.
But it wasn't...
With the guy who
almost blinded him.
Blaine, I sang you a song
to express my regrets.
Okay, if we're here,
to be brutally honest,
there are a few things
that I'd like to change.
I am actively listening.
Well, for starters,
Kurt has a tendency
to snap his fingers
at wait staff.
The cheesecake's on its way,
Kurt, you don't have to
snap your fingers, it's not
gonna make it come any faster.
Okay, I hear you,
and that's something
I'm willing to work on.
Also, please stop slipping
bronzer into my moisturizer.
You look good
with a little color.
I only use lotion on my hands.
It looks weird if a person
just has tan hands.
Okay, Kurt, wouldn't
you love Blaine
just as much if he
didn't havtan hands?
And while we're
being perfectly honest,
I don't like that
with every conversation,
we end up always
talking about NYADA.
What song you're gonna sing,
what outfit you're gonna
wear to your callback,
how amazing New York is.
New York is the only thing
we talk about now, Kurt,
and it's like...
...well, it's like you can't
even wait to get out of here.
How's that supposed
to make me feel?
In a few months,
you're gonna be gone.
With this brand-new life,
these brand-new friends,
brand-new everything,
and I'm gonna be right here.
By myself.
You're right.
I have been distant.
And I'm sorry.
But I'm just...
trying to practice what life is
going to be like without you.
You are the love
of my life, Kurt.
And I'm pissed off
that I have to learn,
for the next year,
what being alone
is gonna be like.
But you're not gonna be alone.
I'm gonna Skype you every day,
and you're gonna come visit me
in New York every weekend
as far as I'm concerned.
But I promise,
you aren't gonna lose me.
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
Champagne.
On a Tuesday.
We've gone all Hunter S.
Thompson, haven't we?
For the bride.
Thank you.
We are celebrating.
Who needs Mr. Lavender?
I have found the perfect
wedding location.
You did?
The K.O.A. campground
by Route Nine.
A campground?
Think about it.
They've got plenty of
space for a stage,
the electrical hookups
they use for the RVs
have plenty of juice for all
the amps and the instruments,
and they're leaving the
restrooms open for us
so everyone doesn't have to
walk around with quarters.
It, uh, sounds a bit rustic.
Married under the stars...
it's... babe, it's romantic.
I have OCD.
I throw away a broom
after I've used it once,
and you think I want to
get married at a campground?
I-I know it's not ideal,
but it was the only place
that was available.
Unless we move
the wedding to November.
I won't do that.
Will, the Glee kids will
come back for the wedding
if it's in November.
What if they don't?
I'm sorry.
I just don't want them to leave.
You know, that's the wonderful
thing about being a teacher.
Every year you get a new
group of kids to inspire you.
Yeah, but these kids
changed my life.
Three years ago,
I was just a Spanish teacher
sitting here with Terri telling
me to go be an accountant.
But now I'm going to Nationals
for the second time, and...
and I'm marrying you.
It'll never like this again.
You know, you and the kids
gave each other a gift.
But the love that
you have for each other,
you keep it with you.
That never goes away.
:
I'm just going to
miss them so much.
They know.
Which is why, you know,
if-if you and I
had our wedding ten years
from now, on the moon,
those kids would be there.
Would you prefer that
to the campground?
+
Is that, is that too much?
Hm-mm.
Is that, um...
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
It happens.
It's just that you are
the prettiest, nicest,
best-smelling girl
I've ever met.
How many girls
have you met?
Weren't you homeschooled?
Don't do that.
Don't find ways to
run yourself down.
I guess I have been
doing that a lot lately.
It's just hard not to
focus on what I've lost.
What if I helped you?
Like the way
I use my hands
to move your legs...
maybe you could use
my eyes to see yourself,
the way I see you.
And what would I see?
Perfection.
So... what are you
looking for, here?
I mean, do you want me
to be your girlfriend?
I don't know.
I mean, yes, totally,
but my faith means
everything to me.
It's just that
when I'm with you,
I don't care what God says
about sins of the flesh.
I just want to know what
it'd feel like to be...
right up next to you.
You would give up
your faith to be with me?
I don't know.
Are you asking me to?
No.
No, never.
Because you don't
like me that way.
No, because it's
nice knowing that
there's something out
there that can't be lost.
All right, help me up.
Well, so what is this?
About you and me?
I don't know.
Something new.
I love your
jauntily placed cap,
like a Russian Tsar.
It's not Chandler.
I swear I told him
not to text me anymore.
I know. It's from me.
How unscheduled of you.
But what about Glee practice?
No one will be there.
Mr. Shue said
it wasn't mandatory,
so Rachel's prepping
her NYADA piece,
Finn's at the shop, Quinn's
getting physical therapy,
Puck's driving to Gomer
for a sale on chlorine.
Everyone is going their own way.
Come on.
Let's blow it off.
But it's Glee.
I mean, we only have
so many left together.
Clap your hands, y'all
Turn me up, turn me up
Clap your hands, y'all,
it's all right
Turn me up
Clap your hands, y'all,
it's all right
Uh-huh
Clap your hands, y'all,
it's all right
Ohh...
If tomorrow is Judgment Day
Sing mommy
And I'm standing
on the front line
Mm-mm
And the Lord
Asks me what I did
with my life
I will say
I spent it with you
Clap your hands, y'all,
it's all right
It's all right
Clap your hands, y'all,
it's all right
If I lose my fame
and fortune
Really don't matter
And I'm homeless
on the street
On the street, oh, Lord
And I'm sleeping in
Grand Central Station
Okay
It's okay
If you're sleeping with me
Clap your hands, y'all,
it's all right
Clap your hands,
y'all, it's all right
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
Your love, baby
It would take an eternity
to break us
Don't look down now
And the chains of Amistad
couldn't hold us
Your love is my love
Is my love
And my love is your love
My love is your love
It would take an eternity
to break us
For there's love now, baby
The chains of Amistad
couldn't hold us
If I should die
this very day
Very, very, very day
Don't cry
Don't cry
'Cause on earth
we wasn't meant to stay
Na, na, na, na, na, na
And no matter
what the people say
Really don't matter
I'll be waiting
for you after
The Judgment Day
Ohh...
Your love is my love
Your love...
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity
to break us
And the chains of Amistad
couldn't hold us
Clap your hands, y'all,
it's all right
Clap, clap, clap your hands
Come on
Clap your hands, y'all,
it's all right
Clap your hands, y'all
Clap your hands, y'all,
it's all right
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love.
