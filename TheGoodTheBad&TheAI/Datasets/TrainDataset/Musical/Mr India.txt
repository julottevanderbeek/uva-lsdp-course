Police siren ...
Gentlemen, you are all responsible
officers of Defense, Police, & lntelligence.
You all understand the seriousness
of the matter to be discussed
Whatever is to be said will
be not be enough
According to this CBl report the
powers responsible for this violence
erupting all over,
those business groups whose
job is adulteration, racketeering.
Those smuglers that sold drugs
are now smuggling arms as well
These are not different gropus.
There is a much bigger organization
And behind this orgaization is
the might of someone foreign.
Hail Mogambo!
Hail Mogambo!
After the government godowns
were set on fire
wherever there was a shortage
of food in the country
adulterated food at black market
prices has been spread
There are over a lakh of liquor
and gambling dens now in the country
There will be over a crore profit
from adulterated food.
MOGAMBO lS HAPPY
Daaga...Teja...
This crore of rupees invest in other
nefarious activities.
Within lndia, this violence and destruction ...
this stealing, fighting, riots,
breakouts ... ...
ALL of this, if it continues as is
that day is not too far when
Mogambo's dream will be for real.
We need a place on the Bombay shores,
where from we can smuggle arms
as we wish, when we wish.
Preparations wil be done?
Absolutely!
MOGAMBO lS HAPPY
lgnorant and uncouth lndians
have not learnt a thing from
their history as yet
As and when they have fought,
foreign forces have enslaved them.
To date they continue fighting...
LET THEM FlGHT
On the basis of religion ...
language ... race ...
whatever weapons they need to
fight ... Mogambo will give them
And when the foundations of this
country are destroyed, THEN
then l will take the next step,
and all of lndia will be at my feet.
And every lndian my slave
then all the world will cheer ...
''Hail Mogambo, the King of lndia!!''
MOGAMBO lS HAPPY
mechanical whirring...bubbling
You ... you ... you ...
Jump ... jump ... jump
MOGAMBO lS HAPPY
The day l find that formula.
Which formula?
Using which one cannot be seen.
turns invisible.
Think! These soldiers that would
do anything, were invisible.
Who could fight them?
An invisible man ... such a formula?
About 20 years back, an lndian
scientist had invented such a formula.
He is dead, but did not give the
formula to anyone
An invisible man ... such a formula?
How could this be??
Why not?
Science is moving so rapidly
lt would be wrong to say that
what was not possible then
is not posible now.
l am not going too far in history,
about 100 - 150 years.
Those days if someone claimed
that steel planes would fly
going 1000 miles in a few hours
people would call him crazy.
But planes were made, and no
one questions their existence.
To King Akbar, if someone was
to speak of phones, radio, cars,
he would not believe it
That we cannot see, we refuse
to believe
lfwe had spoken of transparent
photographs that could see inside us
They would have laughed
exactly as you all do now.
But, X-Ray is a common thing now.
Sir... Yes, Raman
How X-ray could see within,
Can science make someone invisible
What nonsense? There is no such thing
But Sir ... you had said that
Please sit down
This is no time for jokes
We want - Dr. Jagdish Verma,
that formula- give it to us.
At no cost
Don't be a fool.
lfyou do not, your assistant
Prof. Sinha will give it to us
at a price.
That's why, don't be a fool.
Give us that formula
We will give you your price.
You cannot buy me. l'll call the Police
NO
Mr. Sinha? Catch him, shouldn't escape
Oh! Raman, what is it?
Sir, l think l have upset you ...
lt's no such thing
Actually it was my fault.
Your question was appropriate
But... the right to answer is his
Sir, whose picture is this?
He was a well renowned Scientist
Raman, you had met Arun
He is Arun's father, remember.
The one you said had several children.
Yes... he is the one
He grew up an orphan,
maybe that's what pains him
Wherever he sees an orphan child
he takes them home.
What's his home, but
a small huge Hostel.
Calendar, oh! Calendar
Oh, my egg!
What is it Arun brother, like a madman
are you yelling for me?
This l cannot understand yet,
why your parents named you 'Calendar'
Well, they wanted to name me
something in English
Even if they had named you Queen Elizabeth
You would still be a cook here.
ln english - Cook
Where were you?
l was dead in my room.
Die where you want,
but why is it that l have to cook
over halfthe breakfast every morning.
Why is it? Answer me?
lt's your luck, whose mistake is it?
The mistake is - you do not
know difference between sleep and death.
People who sleep, wake up
You refuse to wake up.
See Calendar, if you awake late tomorrow
something will be deducted from your pay.
Sure, at least that way l will be paid
By God, its been 5 years
This way l could see a salary.
What colour is it?
The colour of Brinjal
Do hear the Morning News.
The food ration is almost 'finished'
We will bring some from the grocers.
Second news, landlord came for rent.
We will give the rent
The kids have showered?
Yes, did so yesterday, right now
they are sleeping, sweet dreams
Good Morning... Children
faucet turning
Let's go, hurry up, breakfast is ready
One by one, go to the bathroom,
get ready. Hurry. Brush up.
Arun brother, it would ne so nice if
these unexpected showers would stop
Dear Jugal, if you'll were to wake up
without same and go to school
that would be so nice.
Brother, why are schools in the morning?
Because everything starts in the morning
Life sleeps at night & awakes in the morning
lfwe have to walk with life,
we have to wake up in the morning.
Why are Mondays always after Sundays?
Just as sadness after happiness,
happiness after sadness, night after day
day after night, Monday is after Sunday
and after Saturday is Sunday ...
S U N D A Y!!
lt's been 2 hours - and just 4 bags?

One kilo of grain contains halfkilo stones.
But wheat, rice, pebbles, stones are same

There goes buffalo in the water'
Stones in my grain. Go elsewhere.
How could we? Habit is such.
Eating food is no fun without

By the grace of God.
Why? Aren't you benefiting too?
With your grace, yes l am.
Should l leave?
Leave, but that house should be empty.
That landlord is our man.
He will vacate that house in a snap.
You want the house. You'll get it.
Vacate the house. What are you saying?
Just what you hear.
Think of all the years we have spent here.
Why think of all the years you
have spent here?
What of all the months you have not paid?
l will pay the rent...
Not will pay... but HAVE to pay.
Here is the notice of your dues.

And that he invented something
beyond compare in the world.
What was that thing?
What was that thing?
people would not believe it.
But you are his son.
l will tell you.
lt was a gadget, that by turning
on would make someone invisible.
An lnvisible man.
How is that possible?
Why cant you see in the dark?
Because there is no light... uhh
Why can you see in the light?
l will tell you.
Because the light bouncing off
of someone makes them visible.
But if there was something created
that would allow the light to go
Did not understand.
Like glass.
Light hits the glass, and passes
through hence its invisible.
l see you'll do not believe me.
No No Mr. Sinha. lfyou say.. so..
But where is that gadget to
let light pass through the body.
Your father destroyed the formula
as.. he.. did not want it to be abused.
But where is that thing. The gadget?
You have it?
Let that be.
Did you find a paying guest?
Not found  found
And how wonderful is she!!

All children to one side.
And l still wont allow them to succeed.
Now l will take civil action against you.
This football will be presented in court.
Why in the court?

Childish programs??
Two women talking of in-laws.
Two business men talking about prices
sometimes there is a discussion
on love between two lovers
simply amazing.

a secret with you, that l never did.
Your father...
Seems like there is no power
Whosoever put this adget around
their wrist and clicks the button
will turn invisible.
Under these circumstances, they
can only be seen through red
light or glass, as the gadget has
no effect on the colour red.
Except for that with a flip
of the switch the person will
become completely visible, and
no pair of eyes in the world
can see them.
What do you think Jugal?
What should we do?
Whatever Mr. Sinha said is true.
Should l wear it?
Yes.
Should l turn on the switch?
Yes. Yes.
Arun brother. The lights...
Where are you?

Please come back.

Yes.
My good brother.
Please come back again.
What is happening?
l will go crazy. l will go crazy.
Please don't do that.

ln that case l will turn
invisible forever.
Jugal, see those red pieces
of glass there.

Now see me through them.

And now?
Now l cannot see you.
