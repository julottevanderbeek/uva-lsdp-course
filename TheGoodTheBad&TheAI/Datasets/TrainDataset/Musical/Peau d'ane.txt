DONKEY SKIN
From Charles Perrault´s fairytale
Allow me, before I die,
to make one request.
If you should wish to remarry...
Never, dearest Queen!
I should rather follow you.
I believe you.
But the State requires heirs.
I gave you only a daughter.
Your advisors
will want you to have a son.
Hush!
Listen...
Swear by your love for me
to marry again
only when you have found
a woman more beautiful than I.
Impossible!
Swear it
so that I may die content.
I swear it.
The Queen is dead.
Come, father.
Leave me, child.
I never wish to see you again.
Ministøi!
Speak.
We think that it is bad for you
- and for the State - to remain alone.
Solitude is unhealthy for kings.
It is time you remarried.
Why do you always request
the impossible?
The State needs a male heir.
The kingdom is at peace
and does not desire war.
Your advisors can but approve
of your policy
but we  supposed to advise you.
I understand your reasons.
I can remarry
but I swore to the Queen
to wed only a princess
more beautiful than she.
- A vain promise!
- How so?
Her beauty matters little
if she is prolific and good.
I do not agree with you
and I will not break my promise.
Search for a princess
who might suit me
in the neighboring kingdoms.
I wish but to please.
The Prime Minister!
That means trouble.
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.
Well?
Two of our messengers
have brought us
some charming portraits.
If they are like the others,
keep them.
Those were so bad,
you couldn´t tell
whether the girl
was pretty or stupid.
Let me see.
Her father has the largest kingdom...
Come now... Let me see!
She is hideous!
Her father would give you
half his land...
Let him keep it all!
I won´t have an ugly woman
on my arm!
This one is not so young but...
her fortune is greater by far...
than the number of her years.
Sadness!
Boredom!
Pride!
Hypocrisy!
They are all one-eyed or hunchbacks!
And probably deaf!
The fairytale princesses...
have they all disappeared?
There is this one.
Let me see.
God, how lovely she is!
You were hiding her, traitor.
How sweet she is! How pure!
How graceful!
Just look at that shoulder!
Who s she?
Your daughter, Sire.
How beautiful she is!
More than the Queen, Sire...
And much more charming
and intelligent.
Your father, the King,
has sent for you.
You sent for me, father?
Does that surprise you?
Since my mother is death,
you have avoided me.
Were you hurt?
- Yes, father.
- I am sorry.
Solitude was my sole companion.
I have decided to change.
Stand, dear daughter.
I was listening to you.
Your singing enchanted me.
If you like music,
perhaps you do not dislike poetry.
I know little poetry,
but I like it.
I have some poems of the future.
The ancients wrote well...
but the poets of tomorrow
may delight you more.
Do you like it?
It is disconcerting.
Your godmother,
the lilac fairy, gave it to me.
Her knowledge
of the future amazes me.
Listen to another
which suits you well.
I love you and want to marry you.
Poetry deranges you, father.
I beg you to stop.
- Do you love me?
- Yes, a lot.
A lot is not enough.
Allow me to go, father.
I feel weary and troubled.
Be that as it may,
I have decided to marry you
and marry you I will.
Don´t ask me for such a crime.
Let me think.
Until tomorrow.
Ty jsi moudrý.
Your advice has never ed me astray.
I love the Princess
and I wish to marry her.
Is mine a sinful love?
Is she fond of your Majesty?
She says she loves me... a lot.
Yet she is confused.
Do you see what I mean?
The Princess is too young
to analyze her feelings.
It is written here
that all little girls who are asked:
"Whom will you wed
when you grow up?"
reply: "I want to marry Daddy."
Have you a daughter?
No, unfortunately.
but if I did,
I should certainly marry her.
You are the wisest of the wise.
I shall marry the Princess.
You! So early!
I hate to be taken unawares.
Excuse me, godmother,
but I have to tell you...
Don´t cry, child.
It will make you ugly.
But it´s dreadful!
Sit down.
Don´t tell me.
I know all about it.
Let me finish dressing.
And dry your tears.
You, go outside and play.
Yellow isn´t becoming to me.
That´s better.
My child, it would be sinful
to marry your father.
You must discourage him.
But I love him.
I know...
But you´re mixing up
different kinds of love.
I must give him an answer tomorrow.
Don´t worry. Nothing bad
will happen to you
if you follow my advice.
Are you sure?
Fairies are always right.
We must thwart your father.
You must tell him that you have
a whim for... Let s see...
a dress the color of the weather.
It´s very complicated and costly.
He´ll never be able
to give it to you.
A dress the color of the weather!
Is it a condition?
Oh, just a whim.
And you will marry me?
Yes, father.
The devil take me!
But what kind of weather?
Good weather, father.
What kind of weather?
Good weather, of course!
I need it tomorrow.
We haven´t time!
The color of the weather!
He succeeded! How dreadful!
Let me look at you.
It´s gorgeous!
I never saw anything like it.
I didn´t think it was possible.
He must love you very much indeed!
What do we do now?
We must be unreasonable.
Ask him for a dress
that is more sparkling,
less common...
A dress the color of the moon.
Go at once.
The color of the moon?
Yes, father, more sparkling,
less common...
but that one fits you perfectly.
I find it quite ordinary.
I would not displease you.
The co or of the moon?
Yes, father.
The color of the moon?
And even more sparkling
than the nightly orb.
Now he´s asking for the moon!
What a beautiful dress!
My father is so sweet! I am full
of love and ready to marry him.
- You can´t!
- But he´s so nice!
Impossible!
I tore my dress again.
How sad!
That´s life.
There is something wrong...
My magic spell
won´t work anymore. Is it spent?
Can a spell wear out
like a dress?
No, but it can weaken
like a battery.
A battery? What´s that?
Nothing... I´m getting old!
But fairies don´t get old.
You´re right. I had forgotten.
Still my power over men
has weakened.
My spell doesn´t work anymore
on your father.
I must admit
that I am very fond of him.
Oh no!
We shall conquer
this unwholesome passion.
We´ll be simply odious.
Tell him you want dress
the color of the sun.
He´ll give it to me.
We´ll see.
Anyway, I have another idea.
I think he will be surprised
by the request
I advise you to make.
What request?
Listen...
Oh no! Not that!
That´s horrible! I´d never dare...
I´d rather marry him.
You´ll have to do it.
Are you satisfied?
Frankly, I should like
a more dazzling dress...
the color of the sun.
Is this one not dazzling?
It could be made
of gold and diamonds.
Are you vain, my dear?
Not very.
Why are you teasing me?
You may have the dress
if you assure me
it is a sign of love and not a whim.
It is not a whim, father.
Go! Ask him what I told you.
Oh, I can´t.
Go! I command you.
How dazzling!
I have never seen
anything so radiant!
You are beautiful, daughter.
Are you happy?
I am, father.
I am filled with joy.
Is this your last request?
Or, before our marriage, have you
another desire that I can satisfy?
Yes, but I hesitate...
Tell me anyway.
I´d like... the skin
of that old donkey in your stables.
My banker?
Yes, father.
That s a strange request,
and it surprises me.
Who suggested
this monstrous idea to you?
Your fairy godmother?
She has despised me since...
- Since when, father?
- Never mind.
Besides, I don´t care
what the fairies think,
especially that one!
Well, if it is your last request
before our marriage,
it will be granted.
You will have
the donkey skin tonight.
Don´t be childish!
I cannot escape him.
It is cruel to make him suffer.
He is a ready planning the wedding.
That´s just too bad!
Why must I refuse his love?
What have you got against my father?
I need not explain to you.
Your father behaved badly
in an affair
involving only him and me.
Fairies, like women,
hold grudges.
Don´t cry.
If my father loves me,
why not do as he wishes?
Why flee from him?
I owe him my life after all.
Your education
has been sadly lacking.
What do you advise?
You must leave... quickly!
The King will find me
wherever I go.
You will be disguised.
You have the oddest ideas!
Hurry now.
- Wrap this skin around you.
- Oh, horrors!
Do as I say.
Everything is planned.
Where is my wand?
Here is a chest
for your dresses, your mirror,
your diamonds and rubies.
Take my wand too.
- But you...
- I have a spare one.
Strike the floor with the wand,
and your chest will appear.
- Come.
- Why?
Come here.
No one will recognize you.
You enjoy making me ugly!
Don´t be silly.
It´s going to be an ordeal.
Life s not so easy as you think,
even for the daughter of a king.
A coach will await you
at the gate
to take you to a safe place.
Good luck, child.
Lend me my wand to get home.
Come in, Donkey Skin.
I was expecting you.
I need a scullion to wash the rags.
Yes, Madam.
Call me "old woman"
or don´t call me at all.
You can start tomorrow.
Everybody´s asleep today.
You´re even dirtier than I expected.
By definition, a scullion is dirty.
You think too much.
- You can clean the pig trough.
- Yes, old woman.
I am tired from traveling.
Where can I rest?
There is a hut in the forest.
Oh, how wretched!
Where do you start?
The bed.
A chair.
The table.
A looking glass.
Candles.
And my chest.
No trace of the Princess.
Search the stables,
the sheepfold, the cellars.
We searched everywhere.
She was sleeping
in her bedroom last night.
The Princess may have eloped
with some Romeo.
Nonsense!
I´m going mad!
Send 100 messengers,
Search each hamlet, vineyard,
and meadow.
Bring her back to me.
- Dead or alive?
- Alive, stupid!
Oh, it is too hard to bear.
What about the wedding?
Postpone it.
No wedding! No feast!
No decorations! No cake! No bells!
Leave me in peace.
Until you find her.
I can be consoled
only by her presence.
Be gone!
Are we a most there?
Almost, Sire.
You have eaten nothing.
I am not hungry.
Is something bothering you?
I was thinking
how odd the world is.
They say
it may stop turning.
The fairies won´t let it.
- I don´t believe in them.
- I do.
Fairies are our inner force.
They make us act, for good or evil.
Excuse me.
I need calm.
- I´ll go with you.
- I didn´t say I needed company.
Are you bored, Prince?
Never, Rose...
There is so much to be done,
to discover, to understand.
Is it love you seek?
Of course... like everyone else.
Then follow the path.
You can trust me.
Thank you, Rose.
Tell me, woman,
who is that princess in the forest?
- Not a princess. A scullion, Sire.
- She has the loveliest face.
Little Red Riding Hood, perhaps!
She is a lowly servant.
They call her Donkey Skin.
- Donkey Skin?
- Donkey Skin!
What a pretty name!
Kind sir...
wine and sun have muddled you.
I have not tasted of wine,
and the sun shone
only to lead me to her.
You look mysterious, Sire.
I just saw an angel!
What the devil!
You tremble, Sire.
- There´s a spell upon him.
- Yes. What joy!
Prepare the horses. We´re leaving.
Were you asleep?
I thought I heard you.
We didn´t expect you
until tomorrow.
I´m not cross
but you know how I worry
when you travel.
Did you have a good trip?
What do you mean by that?
That father should do something
about his kingdom.
There are still scullions
living in huts.
Take it up with your father.
You look upset. Are you ill?
I have ridden 50 leagues.
I am tired.
- You´re burn ng up.
- I´m exhausted.
You gallop like mad.
You have a fever.
Are you ill?
Just my luck!
For your return, I arranged
the ball of the Cats and the Birds.
The Marchioness of Carabas
is coming.
All the Princesses want to see you.
Shall I call the doctor?
No! Thank you.
Leave me. I need to rest.
Where is your son?
Must we beg him to come?
I sent for him three times.
Does he know
the ball is in his honor?
Yes. He says
he doesn´t feel well.
- Where is he?
- He refuses to leave his room.
That isn´t like him.
Has he a secret?
Not that I know of.
- Has he eaten?
- He didn´t touch his food.
- I´ll go get him.
- No... I´ll go.
Madame de Ségur is looking for you.
Madame de Cléves
has traveled four days.
They are all asking for you.
They are all silly wenches.
I want to see that girl.
I want to marry her.
I tell you she is a scullion.
I tell you she´s a beauty.
There is much talk
about your absence.
If you tell them
you want to marry a scullion,
they´ll lock you up.
You are right.
But I must find a way to see her.
Until I do,
I will not leave my room.
I´ll be sick in bed.
I have spoken!
What did you say?
Your Majesty...
Leave us, Godefroy.
- The King is worried about you.
- He needn´t be.
- You don´t eat.
- I don´t feel like it.
You left the hunt,
you wouldn´t see the play,
you refused
to come to the ball.
Everything seems to bore you.
Is there nothing that I can do
to amuse you?
There is only one thing
that would amuse me.
Just name it, and it wil be done.
A cake made by Donkey Skin.
Who?
Donkey Skin. You don´t know her.
But you aren´t hungry.
It´s the only thing I really want.
I know it seems commonplace.
A cake...
Donkey Skin?
Get some rest, child.
Thibaud, I want
to ask you a question.
- A riddle?
- No, a question.
Do you know Donkey Skin?
Yes, Your Majesty. She is
the ugliest beast, except the wolf.
And she stinks!
Who´s she?
A filthy thing that lives
in one of your pigsties...
your farms.
She keeps the pigs.
Filthy or not, go!
The Prince wants her
to make him a cake.
I won´t get there before daybreak.
Then go quickly!
Go... quickly... Right.
She must be a good cook.
We´re here.
- Are you Donkey Skin?
- Yes, sir.
I am the Queen´s overseer.
The Prince, who is ill,
requests a cake... made by you.
- Do you have what you need?
- Yes, sir.
Hurry, scullion... We´ll wait.
I hope she washes her hands.
A cake for the Prince! My cookbook!
An apple savarin...
A rum alaska...
A walnut delight.
King´s cream puffs...
An apricot cobbler...
A plum soufflé...
Strawberry shortcake...
A pineapple charlotte...
A love cake!
My dress the color of the sun!
Oh, my skin!
Get up, lazybones.
Don´t keep the Prince waiting.
Hurry up!
- How´s he?
- I can´t tell.
He is delirious but he has no fever.
Aren´t there any fairies around?
They´re all busy.
It´s the full moon.
But you are scientists!
The case s unprecedented.
Here is the cake.
Is it good?
I don´t know. I don´t like cake.
What do you think?
It smells like good butter.
Excellent!
Here, child.
Taste it when you feel like it.
I´m not very hungry.
He shouldn´t eat so fast.
He´ll get air in his blood.
He´s choking!
Do something! He´s been poisoned!
He hasn´t eaten for 3 days.
Give him a glass of water.
Thank you all.
The cake was delicious!
I feel much better.
Now I want to sleep. Leave me.
We must not irritate him.
His illness s characterized
by fluctuations.
The cough is only temporary.
The doctors!
Have you looked in your books?
Yes, Your Majesty.
We are all in agreement
about the diagnosis.
Tell us!
The Prince is dying of love.
- Love?
- I knew it!
What do you advise?
Marriage, Your Majesty.
Is it urgent?
The sooner the better.
Thank you for your wise counsel.
We´ll think about it.
I can´t handle this.
You take care of it.
As you wish.
Wait! I´ll go with you.
My son... My dear son.
My dear child...
We know everything.
You´re lucky!
You shall have her.
Whether she be stupid or ugly.
Oh, not that!
You promised!
Tell us her name.
I do not wish to distress you
but I can´t give you her name.
Look...
I shall marry
the girl who can wear this ring.
What ring is this?
- Who gave it to you?
- No questions!
- We could...
- No! I know you.
If I tell you this much,
you´ll want that much.
I will command the ladies to come...
...to try the ring on.
Thank you.
By order of the King!
All maidens
are to come to the palace
to try on a ring.
Hear ye!
Maidens only...
The one whom the ring fits perfectly
will marry the Prince,
heir to the throne.
Hear ye!
The ring is very small,
and the finger must be slender.
First the Princesses.
Then the Duchesses.
Then the Marchionesses.
What a crowd!
What if it fits several of them?
No chance of that!
But if there were?
I hadn´t thought of that.
Calm down! There´s no hurry.
And please don´t push!
The countesses...
The behinds...
I mean, the baronnesses behind.
Sorry.
I have the smallest finger
in the county!
Next...
Come back in a few years.
With pleasure, Your Highness.
Almost, but not quite...
The maids first, then the cooks.
The turkey keepers
and scullions last.
Stop your crackling...
I mean, your cackling!
Miss Gauthier, servant at the castle.
Miss Nicolette, cook.
Miss Saltandpepper, turkey keeper.
Miss Glum, unemployed.
Is it worth trying?
Give me your hand.
No, the other one.
I told you so.
Is there no one else?
No, Your Highness.
There is no one else, Your Majesty.
My dear child...
Every lady of the realm
answered your summons.
None of them could wear the ring.
I am very sorry.
I am surprised.
This ring must belong to someone.
I don´t think I saw Donkey Skin,
the girl who made me a cake.
Did no one inform her?
I don t know, Your Majesty.
Bring her here immediately.
Here she is, Your Majesty.
Do you live
at the third farm down the road?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Show me your hand.
Oh darling!
I´m marrying your father.
Try to look pleased.
My daughter!
My dear daughter!
We´ll never be parted again.
