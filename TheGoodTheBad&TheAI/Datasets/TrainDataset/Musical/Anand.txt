Did you close all the rear
doors?
How many times do I tell you
not to read when you're lying down
Are you listening to old songs?
- You only told me to listen.
Did I ask you to listen when you
are studying?-Why are you after me.
You will attend every marriage
but do not care for my exams.
Did I ask you? Sit and then read
- All boring wedding.
Can you stay back for me
at least once for today ..
...for the sake of my
exams?
That is ok.
How are the bangles?
You are merciless and look
just like a monkey.
Get this a little bit down.
- No-yeah, that is cool!,
This is for old women
You also got style!
- Tell me how I look?
Can you stay back?
I will give you Rs.20
Rs. 20? That's too cheap. No.
- Rs. 30?
No chance. All my girl friends
are coming today.
Girl friends for you?
First fasten your zip.
Girls may get scared.
Are you mad?
I'll complain to mom. Mummy...
Come back, I will show you.
- You jerk! Mind your business.
Don't open the door without
asking visitor's name.
There is tea in the flask.
- Won't you stay at home, dad?
They might fight for your absence only,
And if I too don't go, that will be worse
If we attend marriages, then
your marriage becomes easy
We will come fast
- Come..
Close the doors. OK?
Wait - What is it?
Mummy, daddy!...
Rupa, Give that cap
- First switch on the records
Will you give it or not?-No...
Switch it on and then take it
Rupa, give his cap.
We are getting late.
Please come early, dad
Please go slowly, sir.
- It's ok.. No problem
My wife has gone out of station.
Had a little bit extra.
Get into the car.
Rupa... my daughter -Is there
anybody to help? Who's Rupa?
Oh God!
From boy-friend...-No, her
fiancee... Good looking and rich!
He came yesterday only-
What's happening?- Having coffee.
Actually there're 7 days, 12 hrs,
What have you done last night?
I've been dreaming of you all night
It is little bit extra. There is no
reply for my 2 calls last night
I was really with you only,
in my dreams.
It is OK, cut the phone.
Have to go to office?
Rupa! 'Reliance' share rates have
increased. Dispose them off.
'EAMCET' results are published.
Do you know the number of Ram?
You are absolutely useless. See
and learn from that girl
It is shameful that our daughter
is more educated than him as...
...our daughter is a doctor, but
son-in-law is mechanic
Already two times by now!
I have no belief now.
Who will comply with me
in this house?
Food, sleep and your friends.
This is all your life.
No earning at all and he is lying
down like a beast. Get up!
What? -Results have come,
and you failed again, fool. Get up
Mother, if I could not pass Inter
how can I get a medical seat
You too scold now and then.
This is injustice
Useless fellow! Playing all day
and watching cableTV at night.
How can you get ranks and
seats, useless fellow. Get up
You live in whatever way you can.
I won't give you single pie.
Grand mother! Beat him.
- Anita! Catch him
Come darling, let us go to
the bathroom
I want a puppy. You promised me
last time. -Ok-I've no friends
I'll purchase one for you.
Brush up your teeth first
I do not want old songs.
I want puppy.
Rupa! Take this naughty girl
and control her.
Actually we should keep
that snoopy fellow in zoo.
But still I have to
attend the singing class.
How I wish Roopa is dead! Srikanth should
be bashed up and thrown in the drainage.
Rupa! Raju has again fallen in
love, do you know?
What has he done?
See Rupa! Ms Radha is not
talking to me.
Rupa! Father is angry with me.
You know how crazy my mother is
My parents are looking for
matches for me...
If my career is bright, I may tell
my parents about his love
I am in soup, due to his love
now -This is too much, Radha
Rupa! Please advise him not to
talk to me
Are you enjoying sound sleep,
or unsound as in movies
Yes, I have no sleep because
of my wedding arrangements
Then why do you attend office
when wedding is next week.?
Today is the last day. There is
one account to finalise today
Hi, what happened?
He is yelling at me again.
Did you give your wedding card
to our Manager?
Yes, and also my resignation letter too..
- What did he say?
There was no expression on
him, but he said OK.
These have to be stitched.
A lot of dresses.
More than enough for a marriage
What to do? Have to change
everything... No pants... or T-shirts
This cut should not go deep.
Should be at some higher level
That is most important.
Don't forget it.
Hi... Rupa -Please tell her.
I want within 2 days
Mummy wants you to meet her
this evening.
Why, is it urgent?
I have lots of work.
I am disposing off my Reliance shares
- Why?
To meet our wedding expenses
at your level.
That's why, I have not
demanded dowry
Had you asked that, I'd have suggested
you to look for some other bride
I know, can't you adjust for my
mother-Granny is coming
Please come home this evening,
need to introduce you to our relatives
Is it essential? -Yes
- When can we start?
You can go alone.
I have to go to shoe store
You can go there tomorrow.
I will accompany you
I feel tensed to go alone
- You have to get used to it.
Should I take you to select
shoes?
You will select some '60s model.
How is this shirt? -So So..
Useless shirt. You can't like this.
Please remember to come at six
Come with a saree.
You know the rules.
I know, sir. No salwar, no scooty
I should salute and be obedient.
I should touch the feet of elders
as soon as I enter. Is this OK?
Stop here. It is 6 o'clock
already. What if it's late?
Why this tension as though
a world war has started?
Do you come inside? -No
please, not into this house
They may degrade you
if I accompany you as a friend
Pull your jacket down. Stomach
should not be seen, for them
They are very traditional
You have asked me to come
for shopping.
I do not like all these
formalities
For my sake...- How do I look?
- Like my face
I am angry. I will tell you after
we go back.
Have you come, daughter?
Come...
This is the aunt of Rahul
She is our family friend from
Kanpur
These are Rahul's paternal
uncle and aunt from Benares
This sari is nice. But why did
you bring that girl with pants?
She could wear some decent
dress at least. Shameless girl!
Another problem. I've to go to
bathroom urgently. Where's it?
I do not know.
Please try to wait
You have to learn to cook
our Marwari food for our Rahul
Could you manage all the
arrangements for wedding?
You're alone. Can you arrange
everything perfectly?
The arrangements should be
made at grand level
I am under pressure.
- Please wait
Do you want something?
- We have to leave urgently.
Sit. These people've come
from a long distance to see you
--What have you prayed for?
Hello, what did you pray?
You woke me in the morning for...
...coming here.- Not one, but
I prayed for many things.
First, my marriage goes off smoothly
and I should be happy
Do you believe in it?
- Yes, a lot
I'm tense, whether I can merge
in their family or not...
...and if everything goes properly
Terrible. It is a bore.
Don't go to wedding
If you feel so,
what could I feel?
New people, new house, all the
restrictions levied only on me
Tell me one thing.
Do you really love Mr. Rahul?
I do not know anything.
Even I did not think of this much.
I didn't find any deficiency in him
when he proposed.
He is rich and eligible.
If he wants he can find...
...number of brides
- Don't say that you are after his money
No, I am just mentioning
No doubt, they are complementing
you by all means. But I think...
...you may have to sacrifice
many qualities after marriage
That should not happen. His
mother won't let you be yourself
I do not know to what extent
Mr. Rahul can support you
I do not know about Rahul, but
her mother is trying...
...to dominate me already.
I feel a little scared now.
But then, God will look after
me well. I have no doubt.
Good luck will befall me with this marriage.
Looks like a mad man
despite being rich and brought up in city,
what is her name ...?
...Venkatalakshmi?
- Why should we bother?
Ask for a boon.
- What?
Venkatalakshmi should choose
and prefer me for marriage?
What? -No, I should choose
and prefer Venkatalakshmi
How can one marry without
seeing even the bride's feet?
Do you like to see her feet
before you make a choice?
You are spoilt after you had
been to America.
You are the real culprit.
You are misleading my mother...
...with your meaningless
suggestions
Come, let us go.
How is he calling you
as Rupa?
Raju, where is my father?
- Here only. -See there
Dad... Dad...
Rupa... Rupa
Dad, let us go.
She is not Rupa. If you do like
this I'll not take you to marriage
I will go back to America. Raju!
Take Dad to our place-Ok
I will come
Sit...
Please sit, Dad
your work is not over-If we further delay,
mom may kill us.
Everything is a joke to you. She
is in tension now.
You have not come to see
Venkatalakshmi, but...
...brought dad to show
the marriage of Rupa
Please don't reveal this to
mother. She may kill me
How could mother like her? She
is driving her to temples.
Hi, Venkatalakshmi-Just Lakhsmi
- Hi Lakshmi, I am Anand
Are these Pullareddy Sweets?
- Yes -They are nice
You tell me - You start
- This is very embarrassing
I do not know anything about
you. Even you do not know me
MBA is almost over. That too
with the consent of my mother
She is forcing me to see
the girls.
Sorry, I didn't mean that way.
I am actually tired.
Did you see many girls?
Not many. A few only, that too
when mother forced me.
And what about you?
- I am doing fashion-designing
Hobbies... I like cricket..
and movies! You know Chiranjeevi?
...His daughter, Ms. Pratima
is my classmate.
Nagarjuna, now and then, visits
our house. -Is it? -Just kidding
How many girls, have
you seen before?
Anand, will you put batteries in
this car?- So Cute-What's your name?
Sameer-Take this!-Whose kid
is this? -Our driver's son
He has been brought up
with us since childhood
First tell me, whether you like
Venkatalakshmi or not.
You put me under suspense. I like
her. If you say OK...
...I'll finish the marriage. What
do you say? All seems ok.
Raju, you tell me.
Am I hurrying?
Chiranjeevi will come to your
marriage. -What is that?
He says that Chiranjeevi's
daughter is her classmate
What is that, Anand? There
should be some reason
What is lacking in her? Tell me,
I have to answer them
My good mother, go for sleep.
I will tell you tomorrow.
Go away. I thought of fixing the
marriage, if you like her
I will go to Vizag, at least
I can attend to work there.
Is it due to Anand?-Anyway
she'll come in 3 months
You take everything as a joke.
I have an important meeting.
Raju. Show the marriage to these
people, send him to States...
...and later come to our native
town accompanying your father
You're like a girl. I've to search
for a new bride for you now
Be careful, Anand-Are you
listening-Yes, you go. We'll see
I'll leave - Bye...
- Raju, take care of dad
I am getting bored
What shall we do?
When will you prosper?
You never followed me.
You will not wear a suit. Some
status is required at least
I will come just now.
- Father, where're you off to?
On whose behalf have you come?
- Bride's behalf
If so, please take this and
serve this in that room
Rupa, where are you?
You sit. I will check up
Whom do you want?
- Rupa... there... -Wait, dad
Sorry, he is my father.
He intends to meet the bride.
But who are you?
- I am...
Who is that?
Where is he?-Busy in the hall
looking at girls.
Rupa! Please take this.
Please take these too.
Who are you?
Who is this?
You need this twice today
lest evil eye is cast on you
Please wear this sari, not in your
South Indian style. Please help her.
Rupa wants to wear her
mother's saree
No, no. This is our family
tradition. She's to wear this
Aunt! If I wear this, I feel that
my mother is with me
I already said "no". Wear this
sari and come quickly.
You wait! I will talk to Rahul and come.
This is too much
If you go again, you will be
beaten
Finished off your serving. Face
must have value, not attire-Come
Why do you create fuss for
a small thing?
This is not a small thing.
It is her mother's saree.
Since her childhood it is her
desire to wear it on her wedding
It is a precious thing for her
and for her sentiment
I know it, Anita. Do not get
excited unnecessarily.
It is better to follow elders in
these affairs. Tell her to listen...
...to mother. It's not a big deal.
I'll see everything after wedding
Not a big deal?
Then I will keep like this only, big deal!
You are just like Goddess
Mahalakshmi
Grand mother! You tell her at
least.
She advises us to change this
saree.- What happened to this?
Rupa, didn't you change your
saree yet? Go and change
Madam! This is her mother's
saree. Let it be. It is good.
Being an elder woman, why are
you saying this?
Rupa, it is delayed already,
go and change your saree
I can't do it, mother. This saree
only is good for me.
I like my mother's saree.
Please listen to me
Rupa, will you change your
saree or not?
Rupa, go and change your saree.
Do not make this a big issue
Anita, take her inside. I will
go and talk with them and come.
When she is so stubborn. She is
elder, let us listen to her
A bride should remain
as a bride only
It is a sin, if a bride talks back
to her mother-in-law.
We do not know your traditions,
madam. Please bear with us
I am her mother-in-law. Isn't it
her duty to respect my word?
She might talk back after
wedding-She's young. Leave her.
Why should I leave this matter?
She should change sari and come...
...touch my feet and apologize.
Then only I will come
Grandmother, please bring her.
I took pity on her as she has no parents.
There is no dowry, no money
and no caste.
But she is very arrogant and
not at all obedient
She has defied me in the
presence of all. I'll see her
Mother! What is this injustice?
Since she has nobody, you have
taken pity on her.
You can change her after
marriage as you wish.
I can't shut my mouth. I will
not repeat the mistake I did first
What have you told me?
You said, she is obedient...
...and she will listen to us
as she is an orphan.
Can't we get a girl like this
in our community?
I consented to you due to my bad
fate. How dare she insults me?
Aunt! I did not expect that you
will be upset. I am really sorry
Realise and understand first.
My command is always an order.
There is no amendment. You have
to follow without questioning.
Don't feel proud that you
are the only one for my son
My single call can bring hundreds
of brides with millions of rupees
...to stand in queue. After all,
you are without parents, dowry,
and caste. I have only favoured
you due to pity. Understand this.
Since you have no parents...
it is not a license to do anything
I'll show you after wedding what
a mother-in-law is? Go now.
Calm down, Rupa-I am afraid of
this marriage now
Rupa, count ten before doing anything
- I have already counted hundred.
Yes, I have controlled myself
while she was talking to me.
I require a clarification.
- Don't Rupa, please...
Rahul, tell me one thing. -Rupa
please go and get ready
Rahul, I need to know ..
- Let her ask.You can ask anything
You told me that you have
convinced your mother. Isn't it?
Did you tell her that I have no
parents and will always oblige you?
Rupa, it is not like that.
- You be quiet
Yes, It is for that only. Yes,
I agreed for that reason only
That means you do not truly like me.
You have no belief in me
You made her to show
mercy on me
Rahul, are you marrying me
due to pity or compassion?
There are beautiful and very
rich brides in our community
You are nothing as compared to
them. This is the truth-Mother!
Rahul! I am scared to live with
you. I fear to enter your house
We are not demons. Stop this
drama right here.
The marriage is not yet over,
she is already trying to create...
...rifts between mother
and son
Mother!
- Keep up our family respect
Tell me, Rahul.
- I am there for you.I love you Rupa
Who requires your love? You
loved me and at the same time ..
...you preferred me to survive
like a obedient dog in your house
I'm sorry - Why do you talk like
that, Rupa?
Sorry, extremely sorry. If I do
not wake up now, I may be...
...doing injustice to my own
life. I don't need this wedding.
I have compromised on many
issues in my life.
But I can't pledge my
self-respect and independence
I can't survive as a dumb and
deaf creature
Let her go. There are hundreds
of brides craving out there.
Don't you feel ashamed to beg
her like an orphan?
Rupa, please consider. If the
marriage is stopped...
...your life will be ruined.
Don't be silly.
Do you spoil your marriage
for a saree.
This is neither a silly thing,
nor the question of a saree.
Even now you are saying that I
can't live without you...
...but you could not say that,
you will miss me
You are posing as though
a saviour of my life...
Instead of surrendering my life
and ruining it...
...I prefer to ruin my life
with my own hands
I'll feel much better. It's ok.
You need not regret for me
What happened, Anita?
Rupa, whereto?
Anita, I lost my control
If I could control, my wedding
would have been over
I am arrogant. I have made a
mistake. My mom woudn't have allowed this
Neither you have done any
mistake and did everything rightly
Let me tell you that God has
helped you a lot
Rahul is not fit for you.
It is God's decision.
If you forget all this, I tell you,
you'll be happy in some days
Now stop crying. Please take
rest. Shall I sleep here?
Mother! Why didn't you take me
with you?
How many days should I be
in pain like this?
Hundreds of girls are seen on
road. You can like them also
Can you stay here for that
reason? Think logically.
What is your level and prestige?
Come, let us go.
What do you know about her?
Just now, she had spoiled her
wedding,
She might be in love with
somebody, or...
...with many people. What is the
guarantee? Think logically
Who is she? What is her
family?...
She has no family. You might
have forgotten, but I didn't.
Who is responsible for that?
My father...
He caused an accident in a fully
drunken state to her family
Why do you talk irrelevantly?
You scare me sometimes. We should
think with our heart at times.
Why do you talk of the
character of an innocent girl?
Where can you stay? How can
you answer our mother?
How can you adjust here?
- I will try. There is no loss
Of course, I will stay there.
Let us check
What about mother?
What about your MBA studies?
Manage our mother somehow.
I can appear for MBA exams.
after 6 months
MBA is not more important
than a life partner
Mother may get anxious.
- Don't tell mother
Now and then I will call as
though I am in America
Please help me at this point.
If not, I may have to marry
a junk girl
If she comes to know of you
it may lead to many complexities
You see, she is very
sensitive.
First I should like her. After
that, she should like me
And only then the question of
marriage.
My name is Anand. I have seen
that "To Let" board.
One room is enough for me. I
won't do any mischief
I know. I know your mother also.
I only posted the wedding card
You can go
If you are up to any mischief, I'll catch
your neck and kick you out.
Hello! - What? -I stay there.
Toilet... -You can go
What is your name?
- I am Anand
Why did you come to my room?
- I am in the outhouse
My name is Samata
- Thanks Samata
Anand! Can you help me?-What
help? -Come inside, I'll tell you
Give that paste to me.
- You've brushed already
Not for brushing.
I like paste very much.
Are you afraid of dogs?
- No, why?
Srikanth has got one dirty dog.
It always growls at me
So, I should fight with it.
Yes, didn't I give you
bath room or not?
From now onwards, we are
friends.
This is my friend, Anand.
He will beat this dog a lot
Hi, I am Anand, staying there on
rent. -Grandma told me
Thanks for allowing me
to use the bathroom.
For Jogging? -Yes
- Can I come with you.
No. Mind your own business.
Is Rupa inside, Sir?
- Ask inside
Payment for tents?
- What?
For yesterday's tents
and also for rickshaw...
Is this sufficient?-Bill is for
Rs. 2,000 only madam.
You have paid excess...
- No problem, keep it with you
Did you meet Rupa?
Not until now, please
We are friends, Let me share
your work with you
Mind your own business, man
Rupa, open the door.
- Come, Anita
What is this, Rupa like a
patient?
Everybody is celebrating your
decision. He was not fit for you
I had got used to him a lot.
Everything has changed in a
single day-Don't weep now
How can I go to office now?
I have distributed my wedding
cards, threw parties to everybody
I have also submitted by
resignation
Everybody is staring at me as a
mad woman and arrogant
Let them think what they want.
It is their fate
There are hundreds of jobs to
choose. Come, let us go out.
Our friends are waiting for us.
Everybody is thinking that I have
spoiled my wedding for a sari.
Rupa! Please forget.
Please quit the subject.
Whoever can understand us
only can remain our friends.
We should worry only
about them.
We need not bother for the
people who don't value us.
Please Come...
- You can go. I have no mood
Just for a change, please come.
- I've no mood, you can go
Please call Rupa.
- Go away, man -Anita
Rupa, I am sorry please.
I was left with no choice.
Rupa, please understand me.
I could not do anything.
My mother...
Leave your mother aside.
Your love itself is faulty.
She is happy without you
- Anita, allow me to talk to Rupa
Who is he? - What is it to you?
Anyway, I'll tell you.
He is Rupa's new boy friend
Come, let us go to movie
Rupa just got independence on September 15.
We are celebrating!
Rupa, I could not support you,
but do you know my position?
I had mother and you on either side.
What can I decide then?
Rahul, I know your limitations.
If I've to change myself...
...according to your mother's
whims throughout my life...
...I may hate myself and
you too may also lose your love for me
This will not be good for both of us.
Hence I put up a break...
...without dragging you into the
mess, so that you may...
...not be affected further.
Please do not force me, Rahul.
You are upset now.
I will meet you again
Anita, I got severe headache,
I am going home
Anita. You can stay here. I'll go
with her. Samata is calling.
Aren't you interested
to see movies?
Rupa! -Rupa, I heard about the
incident. Sorry.
I heard that everything
happened due to a sari.
Will you please sit there?
- No, please
There is a seat in the rear.
- If so, you can sit there
You sat by the side of a girl,
how can you leave it?
Rupa! You could have told them
to shut their mouth
You can say "shut up" to whoever
if you don't like their talk.
Shut up!
What is it?
- Urgent
Anita...-Don't create as an
international problem. Come in
It is difficult to control it.-This
is the last time, I allow you
Make your own arrangements
from tomorrow onwards
Whereto boss?
- To Super market -Come...
Are you new to this town?
I met you day before.
Did you forget me?
Was that you who stepped into
my auto with Anita?
What is this? Is this a new
style of open type auto?
No, this is my style
Ali Style
I saw you with those college
boys. Did you quit your studies?
It may be better you have a
basic degree
Get down first from auto
- What happened, boss?
Everybody gives advice. You are
great, we're all waste
I just said... - What is
this casual remark, boss?
Mother shouts in house, and on
road, people like you? Get down
Is there anybody to help?
- I am here
Did you at least catch a
glimpse of Rupa's feet
- What?-I am just asking.
You are taking a lot of trouble.
I just wanted to check up one
criteria at least.-I'll kill you
You must have made some friends here.
- I have one friend
Hi! uncle.
She's my friend
Is that small girl
your friend?
Anand, is Anita there?
Call her to the ground.
Boys are fighting...
...in the ground, they are
beating up Ali and Ram.
- I will just come.
Is it a serious fight, - I don't know
Anand! Shall I call Gautam?-Yes
Are you Ms Anita?-Yes, why?
Everybody is looking for you
They said that some fighting is
going on in the ground.
Keep all those inside
Keep them, man
Did you beat me? Come to our
side, I will show you
They made a bet
and are fighting over it.
The rules have been changed
again, Anita
They are always like that..unfair
..and these people will never learn.
Did you beat our man?
Brother! He only beat me.
- How dare you hit our man?
What guy! Aren't you keen
to survive on earth?
No brother!
I didn't say anything.
After all you are a kid before me.
I will break your bones
No brother, they are changing
the stakes.
First, give the money fast
- Why should we bother?
Let us bet again and play.
- Who will play? Take out the money
Leave them.
Why this fight? They are young
boys, please leave them
Who are you, man?
Haven't you got sisters
in your home?
Anita, go home with children.
You also go.
Hi, he is arrogant. Take him in
the van. I'll break his pride.
Are you OK? - OK.
It was a small fight. You came with an army
Raju called me up when I was around,
Is he the leader for this?
Leave them Goutam. This is just petty stuff
- You go. I will see -Ok...
Don't put your hand on me.
Hey, Call the MLA
These people won't listen in a
smooth way. You please go.
I will deal with them.
- Ok guys, let us go
You won't understand by mere
talking. Phone now.
Gautam is my cousin.
He just stopped by.
And who is that in the house?
- He is Raju. He's also my cousin
How many cousins do you have?
After all, I came here trying
for a job.
Hey, Where is my stuff?
- There...
He is dead now.
He picked up fight with Gautam.
Who is this girl, seems crazy.
- Anita...
I put her bags inside.
She didn't even thank me and..
...Is trying to order me around.
Actually, you are wrong.
Why did you have to play with those rogues?
What do we know of them?
They bet with us and we played
They seem like murderers.
Did you see their language?
You got only them...
- Ali, tell him not to touch me.
Leave it -Why, all the family
members pray for his welfare...
...but this hero fights with rogues
If they had done anything to me,
then you could've wept for me.
Radha, this is too much.
Ali, actually he should have
been at the coaching centre...
...at that time.
Then, why did he come here?
Radha! Why do you raise the
issue of medical seat...
...when he has no interest in it.
Anand! you don't understand.
Moreover, you can't understand
my concerns at all.
I told you not to touch me
If you do not talk to me, won't
I also feel bad? I love him
Even if he begs on roads, I will still
love him But my dad won't be quiet.
If you do not get a seat this
time, he'll never agree
Then we may have to elope
without anybody's knowledge
Anita! Is Ali there?-He is not home yet!
- I'll inform you if he comes
He went out in the morning
and god knows where he is.
This is another secretive life
What is your problem? If you
pass XII, you can go to Dubai
Oh God! Lessons after lessons.
- Shut up. Auto is enough for you
If you sight a girl, you can't
take your looks off.
Can't you do something and pass
your XII class?
I will surely pass this time.
I had to hear all those bad words from
the rogues because of you. Nonsense!
Why all the people started
weeping today?
Anand! - What happened?
- Beat Srikanth... See this
I have drawn a boy's picture and
he had drawn a line on it
Teacher awarded me
with zero marks
Anand! Isn't that everybody will
have that. Her teacher is mad
No, you are only mad
- Anand, you tell us
Samata, he is correct,
Boys do have that.
Don't you feel shame? Are those
things taught to children?
Samata, come to me. Don't talk
to him. He is a devil.
Rupa! What's wrong in
telling facts to the children?
Will you shut your mouth?
Samata, come to me
OK Samata! Boys will not have
it. Is it OK?
That is worse.
Get up and come with me
Rupa! Hi, how are you?
Is that you, Rupa?
- Sir
I heard the news.
I thought of calling you.
I do not say sorry etc.,
I know, you are a mature woman...
...and you might have
taken an appropriate decision.
My resignation...
I am coming to that. I have not
yet approved that yet ..
You can continue as usual.
Same seat, same group. No problem
Hi. Since morning you are not seen
- I've to go for shopping
Rupa will not come until evening?
- Where has she gone?
Do you want details?
Is there anything special?
No, just casual enquiry
She has gone to nursery.
She goes there sometimes
We have to attend a wedding
I came for you this morning.
Where had you been?
I thought, you may prefer to
go there
Can I go now?
- Do you want to go? - Yes
Ask Ali.
He may take you there.
Anita told me perhaps you may
require some help.
Do you need to run
to come to me?
Wait, it is not like that
Rupa, please listen to me.
Give me a chance
My mother is of old generation.
Our traditions are troublesome
If you ask me to choose
between either mother or wife...
...how can I answer suddenly?
Think reasonably.
I required some time to
think over the problem
I should have reacted at
that time only
Rupa, time has not lapsed.
I will talk to my mother
Let us work out a solution.
Please give me some time.
Rupa, don't get angry.
Tell me something
I will see you tomorrow
My work is finished...
- Can you complete this too?
Keys...
I will come tomorrow, madam.
Whom will you give those
flowers?
I will give to Anita.
Are you going to home?
- Yes.
How much is this?
- Rs. 200
Can you give it for Rs.20?...
- I can give this for that price
Darkness has surrounded already.
How can he come?
If he comes, he will chatter and
give me headache. Let me see
Come
Sit by the side.
- How can I, like ladies...
I am irritated. It is your need.
If you want, you can sit...
...If not, you need not.
Idea.. I will drive.
Can you sit at the back?
Thanks for the idea.
This is your need.
Tell me your preference at once.
- Ok
What is this?...
Tell me, what is this?
This costs Rs.200
I was foolish to offer you lift
It happened just like that, unknowingly.
- Go to hell
It will be hell for us,
through out the night.
We can't do the work
There is also some other job
for that hero.
Please come in Rupa.
- You've headache - Yes
Fever -Yes
Body pain - Too much
Three times a day
- Thanks
At this hour of night, with such rain,
you came for me
Do you watch a lot of movies?
- Yes, I love them
I thought so. There is no such thing Don't
use your imagination. We've lots of work
If you cough through out the
night, it is a disturbance to us
This is done by you. Those black
marks should not appear to me
Either you get it washed,
or purchase a new one...
...it is up to you. Understand?
Rupa, will you please sit for a
while? You came to my room...
...for the first time.
Tea, coffee ...?
Are you OK now?
- Yes. But I feel weak
Come with me.
- Tell me whereto..
Will tell you on the way.
Come
Please wait, I will come now.
- Come
Did Malaika come in your dreams?
- Did she tell you?
Just I was working on lighting,
camera etc.
Do you see any big
flower in my ear?
I was not looking at the legs of
Malaika.
It is OK, every boy looks at
girls' legs
Anyway leave Malaika!
Try Rupa
What is this eatable?
It is so hot
This day is an important day
for Rupa.
Today is the death anniversary of
her parents
She is giving lunch to all the
people in old age home
It is a pity. She lost her parents
and brother in an accident -I know
I've to go to nursery. I will
give you a drop at old age home
Please help her in serving lunch.
Don't eat up her head
She is on silent penance today.
- Yes madam, I will do
Rupa, take this
Can I ask you some thing.
Little bit personal
I can tell you, if you do not
scold and beat me
You should not get angry.
Nothing serious
Did you ever think of the man, who
had caused the accident?
If he meets you again,
what you will do then?
Will you kill him?
I do not know anything about
him. I never thought about it
Aren't you angry with him?
- No. -Is it true?
I feel that the accident
happened because of me only
I delayed them for a long
time with my stubbornness
If they had left at their
scheduled hour...
...I feel that the accident might
not have happened
You give me such pain
but walk away with a smile
You hurt me but
sprinkle flowers on wound
She hides in her words.
and make me wonder
Rupa, do you require any help?
I'm here for you. You go...
...and sit leisurely. Tell me what
you want. No formalities
So lovely as a baby
Pretty as a belle
Teasing me as moonlight..
Killing me with her teasing
All of them have gone Anand.
We are late
