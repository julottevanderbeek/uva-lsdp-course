RADIOMAN: Send it over here,
we can use some action.
RADIOMAN 2: Okay,
you're coming in loud and clear.
RADIOMAN:
Roger. Out.
RADIOMAN 2: Run me a test
as soon as you got time.
The  in.
Pick up this gear in the mail.
OFFICER:
Any word on my discharge?
No.
MAN ON RADIO: Temperature
How she look today,
O'Hara?
Better than yesterday.
When she starts looking real good,
you've had it, son.
That's the day they take you
off this rock, not a day before.
Never seen it to miss.
Won't be long.
-
-
Come on, you donkeys!
What's the rush?
You know you're disturbing the peace.
Okay, teacher.
Hey, wait! Wise guy, wait a minute!
Where you going?
Hey!
Good to see you again,
Mrs. Davidson.
So nice of you to meet us,
Mr. Harris.
- Mrs. MacPhail.
- How do you do?
- And Dr. MacPhail.
- Your first trip to the islands?
Since the war. Never got to see
much from an aircraft carrier.
So a sentimental journey, eh?
How are you,
Mr. Davidson?
Fine, Harris, fine.
Well, hard to believe
that a year has passed.
I think you'll find
everything in order
this time, Mr. Davidson.
- Good.
Hope you haven't
had breakfast yet.
The governor's
expecting you.
Sorry, we've only got two hours
before changing boats.
Would you drop us
at the mission house?
I'd like to see reverend Larsen
before Sunday services.
HARRIS:
Certainly.
My father built
his first mission there.
DOCTOR:
This island looks volcanic.
It is,
in more ways than one.
All these isolated islands where
our servicemen are stationed are volcanic.
It takes constant vigilance
to keep them under control.
You mean to keep friendly relations
with the natives strictly friendly.
- To put it bluntly, yes.
- Any success?
Well, we do our best.
I'll have the luggage
transferred to the .
-
-
All right, you guys, off it.
Here it comes.
O'HARA:
I'll turn it around.
Say, Sarge?
What kind of gear
did you say was coming in?
Refrigeration unit.
Come on,
bear a hand.
How could that
freeze anything?
I can't see her face.
Two years on this rock,
and you wanna see a dame's face?
On a raft once,
off Guadalcanal,
I saw something like that
coming straight at me.
Went right past me too.
Now, that's a piece of equipment
that's really equipped.
I'll unpack it.
- You need help?
- I'll handle it.
- You?
- Who spotted it?
Okay, I'll recommend all of you
for marksmanship.
Now, stand off.
It's an order.
- You pulling rank on us?
- Yeah! Get on the gear!
Let the word out and
she'll hit this rock like an A-bomb!
- Hey, yo-yos!
- Knock it off!
Okay, then,
share and share alike!
All right, come on!
We got to shove fast!
Easy does it, miss.
Thanks.
Well, what do you know?
Marines.
and I'm right at home.
Got me a couple of hours
to kill between boats.
Whats to do around here?
Got any attractions?
You know, grass skirts,
hula-hulas?
All that saucy island stuff?
You picked the right island,
the prize spot of the Pacific.
And I'm in personal charge
of the special tours.
- Leaving when?
- Soon as you're aboard.
Sergeant, you twisted my arm.
- Get the gear.
- Get the gear!
Yes, sir, Sarge.
Oh, hey,
my luggage!
Hey, come on. Hey!
Get it up here!
Get it up here!
Hurry it up!
- Watch it. My record player!
- This all your gear, Miss?
Yeah. That's all.
You can see better
from back here, Miss.
Thanks.
All right,
get on the wheel.
- Yeah, you heard him.
- So did you!
I mean both of you,
on the double!
- Oh, yeah? Why?
- Yeah?
Come on, Griggs. Hurry up,
will you, with that mail.
Wait for the mail!
Wait up!
Oh, my aching back!
- Hey, that's pretty!
- Hey!
Yeah, but I can't see anything
from here.
- How about if I sit up front?
- Can't, you're classified.
- Classified what?
- Top Secret.
- Who says so?
- Sergeant Phil O'Hara.
- And Private Griggs.
- Sadie Thompson. Hiya, fellas.
BOTH: Hi, Sadie.
Mail call!
Whats the matter with you?
O'HARA:
Hurry it up!
O'HARA:
Back her up!
Watch yourself.
You're not driving a tank.
Careful, don't knock
the tank down.
O'HARA: Got you here
safe and sound, Sadie.
SADIE: Where we at?
Bill's place. Everybody out!
Holy cow! Don't you
have any doors around here?
Take her away!
That was a fast tour.
Most of the island's
restricted.
Chung!
Oh, I don't mind.
All these islands look alike.
Palm trees and coconuts.
Anything cold to drink?
Go away. It's Sunday.
Me no open.
Sure, no open,
except for us.
Hiya, Bill. Pour the boys
something cold and tall.
Me no Bill, me Chung!
Bill long time dead.
Very long time.
And you'll join him
if we don't get some service.
CHUNG: It's Sunday.
Me no want to get into trouble.
Hey, Sadie! You want pineapple juice,
or juice from pineapple?
Hey, you, no take.
No take.
Anything,
just so it's cold.
Ooh!
Some weather. It's like
the inside of a hot water bottle.
It'll ease up when it rains.
Okay, Sarge,
everything's secure.
Where's you park the truck?
- Down the street.
- Get it back to the base!
You want the MP's
to pick it up?
Now look, Sarge,
I just got here!
I ain't even been
introduced yet!
When you get back.
Shove off.
- Where you going?
- Where do you think?
You're going to get
Sadie's gear in the truck.
You left it there,
didn't you, Sadie?
SADIE:
That's right. I did.
You heard the lady.
Oblige her!
Glad to.
Excuse me,
Sadie.
Get on the door.
What for?
Keep a sharp look out. You wanna
keep this private, don't you?
Yeah, but who for? You?
We'll rotate every 15 minutes.
Fair enough?
Okay, but you got till 1100 exact.
Then I take over.
All right.
So what do you
put in this stuff?
The more you drink,
the more you got to drink.
It's the heat.
It draws it right out.
There's enough sweat in the South Pacific
to float a battleship.
Sorry, I guess that
hit you kind of rough.
I don't mind.
A guy sort of forgets
how to talk to a girl
who's got stockings on.
You're doing okay.
- Where you heading for, Sadie?
- New Caledonia.
Got a job waiting for me.
What's it like
down there?
The exhaust pipe
of the world. Hot.
This rock's a deep freeze,
compared.
It's jumping.
Anything goes.
You won't like it.
As the Japanese say,
I should worry.
It's not the first time
I've been away from home.
And I haven't
been run over yet.
OFFICER: Open up.
Open the door!
Two meatheads bearing this way.
They see you
with Sadie's gear?
I don't know.
I tried to dodge them.
Yeah, yeah.
By leading them here.
I'm in the middle
of the street!
What do you want me to do,
evaporate?
Lock the doors. Get the place secure,
on the double.
CHUNG:
Hey!
All secure!
I'll cable the Mission Board to
send you a new X-ray machine.
Thank you, sir.
Anything else I can get for you,
Reverend?
If you could arrange for
more penicillin and Bibles.
I'm happy to say
the old ones are worn from use.
WOMAN
:
I'll see you get
everything you need.
There's no point
to a tour of inspection
if some good doesn't
come of it, is there?
No, sir.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.
Never expected a mission hospital
to be so well-equipped.
Never was until Mr. Davidson
became head of the mission board
for the island.
Having lived in the tropics
all my life,
gives me a certain amount
of persuasive power
with those of our trustees
who have never been south of Boston.
You seen to have tropical diseases
under control.
Physical ailments
are simple to fight.
Simple?
Compared to immorality and evil.
Although, from what you tell me,
Reverend,
matters seem to have
improved considerably here.
Yes, Mr. Davidson.
Yes, indeed.
I presume it's time for services.
Rock of Ages
Cleft for me
Let me hide myself in thee
Let the water
And the blood
From thy riven side
Which flowed
Be of sin the double cure
Cleanse me from its guilt
And power
Not the labor of my hands...
MARINES:
A Marine, a Marine, a Marine
He's honest, he upright
His mind is always clean
A Marine, a Marine, a Marine
Almighty
Forever flow
MARINES:
Yes, sirree, yes, sirree, yes, sirree
A Marine, a Marine, a Marine
He's as harmless as Ovaltine
A soldier, a sailor might
Work with a date tonight
But never
Never a Marine
A Marine, a Marine, a Marine
Ah, this is great!
He's honest, he's upright
His mind is always clean
A Marine, a Marine
What a lad!
I don't understand.
The men here have always
been respectful of the Sabbath.
I didn't notice any evidence
of disrespect.
Did you notice the effect of
that music on the natives?
Excuse me.
...to Portugal
wherever he has been
He loves to love
a lovely sea
How about some beer?
Hey!
SADIE: Set them up, O'Hara.
It's my treat.
O'HARA: Oh, no.
Not when I'm around.
Hey, fellas, live it up! You're
gonna be dead a longtime!
No, no, no, Missy. No beer
on Sunday! Please, get out.
Chung, you shove off. If Sadie
wants beer, she gets it.
No, I don't want
to get him into trouble.
Now cut it out!
Leave him alone.
Sorry, fellas. No beer today.
Come on. Give me the bottles.
All right,
you guys.
Sing it up!
Sing it up!
A Marine, a Marine, a Marine
As sterling a fellow
As you have ever seen
His refinement is something
to see
He's what every sailor
hopes someday to be
Recruiting posters
Tell the world
Marines are first to fight
A thousand struggling women
Prove the posters always right
When taking out his favorite doll,
he loves to make a splash
And if she cannot pay by check
She lets him pay by cash
Mr. Davidson! So nice
see you again. Come in.
That won't be necessary,
Mr. Chung.
Look see.
No drinks on Sunday.
Pineapple juice only.
No beer. No whiskey.
Only pineapple juice.
Mr. Chung, in the future, I wouldn't
open this place on Sunday.
DAVIDSON:
For any reason.
CHUNG:
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
...A Marine, a Marine
He's upright, he's honest
His mind is always clean
A Marine, a Marine, a Marine
He's as square a shooter
As you've ever seen
When he plays poker
With his pals
He never will deceive
Hey, fellas! My boat!
What boat?
Come on, baby!
SADIE: Come on, it's been fun!
I'll be seeing you!
Hey, my baggage!
Well, good-bye!
- Good-bye!
- Oh! Ooh!
No, it's just my heel.
Are you a passenger
for the ?
Yes, I am.
No use running, lady.
Your boat's been
quarantined.
One of the sailors
came down with typhus.
- You mean Sadie's marooned!
- For about a week.
Great!
Beachhead secured!
Well, like the Chinese say,
I should care.
Where do I shack up?
Got any hotels on this island?
You can have the suite
right next to mine.
Don't pay any attention
to these guys.
- You come to my Quonset...
- Sure, sure!
Button it up.
There's only one place
to stay on this rock.
Come on, Sadie. Let's get going
before it starts to rain.
Drive us over to Horn's, huh?
GIRL: Mama, Papa!
Mama, Papa!
Mr. Davidson!
Go and play!
Joe! Hotel business!
Hey, you, Joe,
get out of sack! Wake up!
Go and say hello customer!
Tell them to go away, Ameena.
It's too early.
Maybe you no hear who come,
huh? Mr. Davidson!
Davidson?
What the heck is he doing?
Joe, wait. Put on pants.
I wash.
Tell him we're sorry,
we're all filled up.
You want me lie
to Mr. Davidson?
Joe get into trouble lying
to missionary man.
Ameena,
you're a washout.
Ready? Heave!
Hey, what's the matter
with you guys?
You didn't win the war
this way.
You heard her!
ALL:
Heave! Ho!
Hi, there! Hi!
What's your name?
- Mary Horn!
- Betty Horn!
- Tommy Horn!
- Killroy Horn!
- She must be quite a woman.
- O'HARA: Who?
- Mrs. Horn!
-
Joe Horn!
Get on up!
Come on, Horn!
Let's go, you old sack!
Chop-chop! Come on, boy!
So this is where I park?
Hey, Horn!
Well!
Make the best of things today.
It's bound to be worse tomorrow.
You can count on me to help you
make the best of anything, Sadie.
- Me too, Sadie.
- Relax, fellas.
You'll burn out your bearings.
Huh?
JOE: Take it easy.
Joe, I was just
coming up after you.
I got an important guest
for you. Come on.
- Hello, gentlemen.
- MARINES: Took you long enough.
I hope I don't have
to toss you out again.
Sadie! Sadie Thompson,
meet Joe Horn.
- Hiya, Mr. Horn.
- Hiya. Sadie.
One of the worst ex-noncoms
from the 1st Division.
Nice bunch of kids you got.
Yeah, sometimes I wish
they were on another island.
Come on, kids, scram upstairs
and help your mother.
Hurry up! That's it!
Hey, scoot!
Joe, Sadie's boat's
in quarantine.
Put her up in the best
you've got, huh?
I just rented all the suites.
I got nothing left.
I'll end up in the barracks yet.
Why not let her shack up
with Mrs. Horn'?
What happens to me?
- But it's only for a week.
- Only?
Hold it, hold it.
Nobody'll ever say I got in
the middle of a happy marriage.
Anything will do,
with a roof over it.
Got it.
Follow me.
And this better be good.
I been commissioned
to look after Sadie.
Who commissioned you,
O'Hara?
You son of a... Throwing
a lady in a monkey cage!
Wait a minute, fellas.
It's only Willie, the kids' pet.
Take it out!
Go find yourself a tree, Willie.
Sorry to put you out.
Don't unpack nothing, Sadie, till
we get this place squared away.
Oh, it'll take you a year.
Ah, we've cleaned up islands
in minutes.
Come on, you jarheads.
Hit it for Sadie.
Take it away!
Careful of my record player!
It means a lot to me.
Glad it's not a radio. Don't
allow them on the premises.
Haven't heard a commercial any news,
nothing, since I left the States.
- Ho!
- Hey!
Move out of the way,
you guys. Timber!
Get Sadie out of here!
Hey, don't knock yourselves out,
fellas.
My boat isn't sailing
for a week.
Yeah!
Hey, Killroy!
What's cooking, Pop?
Round up your brothers
and sisters
and tell them
to scram for home
before they get caught
in the rain.
Come on, come on,
come on!
Debbie! Tommy!
Da Dee da doo
doo doo doo doo
- Hi!
- ALL: Hi!
Hey, don't you know enough
to come out of the rain?
Come on in
before you get soaked.
Got any candy?
Any gum?
Hm da dee dum
Hear no evil
See no evil
Speak no evil
Just be like
the three little monkeys
That grandmother
had on the shelf
If you hear of anything evil
Just keep it to yourself
So
Hear no evil
See no evil
Speak no evil
Just be like
The three little monkeys
And don't think that
everything's wrong
If more people
did like the monkeys
Life would be one sweet song
So
Hear no evil
See no evil
Speak no evil
That's what the monkeys
Smart little monkeys
Wise little monkeys said
Hey, you people!
Down! Come sit down!
Hello. Chow.
Maybe not so good,
but not so bad.
Thanks,
but I'll be eating out.
Like husband says,
you are so wise.
Come on, kids.
It's time to hit the sack!
Scram!
Scram out of here!
Come on!
Go onto bed! Come on!
Oh, it's so sticky,
I hardly feel like eating.
The rain doesn't help much,
does it?
How long will it last?
About two months,
off and on.
Mostly on, if I remember
the rainy season right.
My dear?
Dear Lord, we thank thee
for this gathering...
and for the food which thou
hast provided for us this day.
- Amen.
- Amen.
I didn't know Mr. Horn
allowed radios here.
What do you say, huh? Hey, hiya
folks, are you gonna eat that?
Hey, that's a good looking
layout you got there.
O'HARA:
Hey, honey!
Hi, frogmen.
Here's your shoe, Sadie.
All squared away.
Come on in
and get wrung out.
ALL: Yeah!
It's that awfully cheap girl
from the
who kept playing her phonograph
to attract the sailors.
It wasn't only sailors
she attracted,
she caught our eye too.
I'm sure that everyone was aware
of her presence, Doctor.
MRS. DAVIDSON:
She made certain of that
from the very first moment
she came on board.
Behaving so outrageously.
Having all those wild parties
in her cabin.
What on earth
is she doing here?
Waiting for the same boat
that we are, I presume.
I detest being under
the same roof with that girl.
It's seems pointless
to go on talking about it
since she has as much right
to be here as we have.
Doctor, I'm going to the mission
hospital in the morning.
Please feel free
to come along.
I'd like to.
You've done quite a job for
the natives at that hospital.
That's the least of our work.
DOCTOR:
What more could you do for them?
Raise their moral standards.
They seem high enough
to make them happy.
No, Doctor. Moral standards
can never be high enough.
Especially here,
where all of nature seems
to conspire against us.
Everything grows with
a sort of savage violence.
Today you see
strange flowers
where yesterday
there were only roots.
Ice, Mr. Davidson?
The old box gave 18 cubes.
Not bad for war surplus
I picked up off the beach.
Still works if you
treat it like a dame.
I mean, if you
keep it in shape.
Please have them turn down
the phonograph, Mr. Horn.
It's giving me
a headache.
Sure. Mrs. Davidson.
Hiya, Mr. Horn.
Your climate's lousy.
Sorry, it's the best we got.
Say, don't I know you people?
Oh, don't get up,
you'll only have to sit down.
Yeah, we were shipmates
on the .
SADIE: Isn't it too bad,
that sailor getting typhus?
I guess you have met
Miss Thompson.
We haven't
had the pleasure.
Mrs. MacPhail, Mrs. Davidson.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
Mr. Davidson.
Nice to know you,
Mr. Davidson.
Miss Thompson.
Sadie, meet Dr. MacPhail.
Glad to know there's
a doctor in the house.
Hope you won't need my services,
Miss Thompson. I'm on vacation.
Not me, Doc.
I'm so healthy it hurts.
O'HARA: Hey, Sadie, come on.
We got to shove off.
SADIE:
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Um, guess I've held up
the parade long enough.
Miss Thompson?
May I ask where you're going?
Oh, the boys are throwing
a brawl at the Chinaman's.
Say, maybe you people'd
like to come along.
You might have a few laughs.
Wouldn't it be wiser
if you stayed here?
You mean
because of the rain?
I wasn't referring to the rain.
You're not reaching me.
You'll be
the only white woman there.
Say, that's real decent of you.
But I wouldn't worry.
A girl gets
just what she asks for.
And all I'm asking for is
company on a rainy night.
Well, if you get lonely,
come on down. Bye!
Boy, that jeep ought
to be floating by now.
Whoa! It's coming down
cats and dogs!
If you think this is rain,
wait till it really gets going.
Oh! This won't do anything
for my figure!
Don't need nothing!
Why, Private Hodges,
I'm surprised.
Hold on!
SADIE: Whoo! Yeah!
Well, to paraphrase
an old saying:
“The situation has landed
and has the Marines
well in hand."
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Excuse me!
Go away!
Listen, when I want you,
I'll rattle your cage.
Oh!
Knock it off!
I told you to fall back!
That goes
for the rest of you guys.
Sadie's only got two legs.
You want her runnin' for home?
No, I like to dance
while I can.
Say, how about it?
You and me haven't cut one yet.
Not my speed, honey.
Well, just shift gears
and follow me!
That girl, Miss Thompson,
I've been trying to place her.
Has she ever stopped on
this island before, Mr. Horn?
Not that I know of.
How are things back
in the States, Doc?
Any better?
In what way?
People still
knocking themselves out?
Faster than ever.
Same old rat race.
That's why I never went back
after the war.
Everything gone.
Slam, bang, hurry up.
Time is money.
Get it while you can.
Don't let up.
For what? Money.
And what's it get them?
High taxes and
a bunch of gadgets
that don't bring nobody
peace of mind.
You're quite a philosopher.
No, just lucky.
Fell for a native girl
and learned a thing or two.
I remember where I saw her.
I'm sure of it now.
DAVIDSON:
Yes, there's no doubt of it.
No doubt of what,
Alfred?
She's one of those women
who worked at the Emerald Club.
What's that?
The plague spot of Honolulu.
That girl worked there.
She's a prostitute.
You shouldn't assume a thing
like that unless you have proof.
Proof? I was with the police
when they raided the place.
I saw her there.
She might have
come with a friend.
Men didn't bring women
to the Emerald.
They went there to find them.
That club was an infamous trap
for servicemen.
I saw them coming in.
All with one set purpose.
Never smiling.
All desire is sad
when it must be bought.
I saw girls from all nations there.
"Entertainers". Harlots!
The place was a sewer
but I finally forced
the police to close it.
The women were to be deported.
Somehow this girl
managed to escape.
You could be mistaken, have
her confused with someone else.
It's obvious she's here
to carry on her trade.
I don't see anything
obvious about it.
Doctor,
I've devoted my life to fighting
corruption in these islands.
I know the look of immorality
when I see it.
I know the sound of
intolerance when I hear it.
Passing judgment on others
without absolute proof.
Robert, please.
Excuse me.
Doctor, if a man had
a gangrenous foot.
What proof would you need
to cut it off?
Gangrene is a matter of fact.
It can be seen.
- It's tangible.
- So is evil.
To me it has always seemed
a matter of definition.
Evil is a fact!
Like right and wrong.
I know what you think,
Doctor.
That there's no such thing
as immorality.
That everything is relative.
I know what you and other men
of science believe.
What Freud, Adler and Jung
have brought on the world.
Destroying moral values.
Now, just a minute.
Destroying moral values!
Leading people to believe that
they're not directly responsible
for their actions.
But we are responsible.
Each one of us must choose
between good and evil.
We must isolate evil.
Stamp it out, the way you fight
an infectious disease.
MRS. DAVIDSON: Alfred, there's
no need to get so upset.
I'm not.
I simply know where I stand.
On the side of right.
Good night, Doctor.
Good night.
Mrs. MacPhail.
We'll see you in the morning.
And of course that invitation to
visit the native hospital still holds.
I appreciate that,
Mr. Davidson.
Just because Sadie's
a breezy dame,
what right has Davidson got to
figure she's out of some joint?
I'm afraid
he can't help it.
How do you mean, Doc?
Fanatics are often too obsessed
by what they fight against
to know why
they're really fighting it.
Oh!
You mean like a guy
who's against drinking
but what he really wants
is to hit the bottle?
Yes. Yes.
All of us have hidden desires,
which we disguise
in one way or another.
Robert, why must you always
be diagnosing everybody?
That put the lid on it.
Not quite.
I still have one more
diagnosis to make,
and it's of you, my dear.
- Me, Robert?
You've had along day,
and it's late. And so to bed.
Good night,
Mr. Horn.
Good night. Doc.
She taught school
in Kansas City
She was cold
and rather drab
So at all the local parties
She was not the one
they'd grab
But she read a book
and then
Came the transformation
She announced one night
To people's consternation
The heat is on
The heat is on
You better not get near
my lips tonight
They've got a kiss
Like a flame
And if you touch my lips,
you might ignite
And you would
have yourself to blame
The heat is on
The heat is on
I wanna know if men
are men or mice
Don't wanna wither
on the bough
I might have formerly
been cold as ice
But I'm a forest fire now
Got an awful lot of oats
that haven't been sewn
They might start
a chain reaction
And I might explode
The heat is on
The heat is on
You're gonna hear
the sirens howl tonight
You're gonna see
the building bounce
Because the lady's
on the prowl tonight
And it behooves me
to announce
The heat is on
MARINE:
More, more, more! Geronimo!
You're in the groove!
Let me stipulate that
my defenses are down
I'm spontaneous combustion
in a satin gown
The heat is on
The heat is on
You're gonna hear
the sirens howl tonight
You're gonna see
the building bounce
Because the lady's
on the prowl tonight
And it behooves me
To announce
That the heat is on
Hey, fellas,
come on in!
It's too early
to break up the party!
Who wants to break it up?
O'HARA: Hang on. Sadie.
We won't drop you.
MARINE:
Home sweet home!
SADIE AND MARINES: Shh!
SADIE:
Let go now.
Feel that heat.
Help me out of this, will you?
Bet my room's like a griddle.
Hey, why don't we park in here?
I'm sure we can get
something cold to drink.
O'HARA:
Hey, Horn!
SADIE: Shh! Not so loud.
There are people upstairs.
O'HARA:
Who cares about them?
- O'HARA: Hey, Horn!
- MARINE: Shut up!
O'HARA: Well,
where is the sack hound?
MARINE: What do you think?
He's a married man.
HORN:
What's all the racket?
How about some beer on ice
for Sadie, huh?
Yeah, make it five.
Only this time, its my treat.
No arguments.
Look, why don't you
call it a night?
It's kind of late, and I've got
fancy guests upstairs.
Complaint registered. Let's go
to my private suite, gentlemen.
If it's okay with you.
- If you keep it quiet.
- SADIE: Promise!
Take a load off everybody.
Relax.
Anybody scared of the dark?
Me.
How about holding my hand?
O'HARA:
No cracks.
That's enough light,
Sadie. It's hot.
Help yourself to
what's left of the bottle.
I think it's
on the dresser.
Yeah, it's still there.
Who wants a drink?
Just pass it.
Pass it.
Don't anybody
mention the heat.
Boy, what a night!
Oh, my feet are killing me.
MARINE:
You want anything, Sadie?
If she does,
she'll ask me.
And that goes for
the rest of you guys.
No volunteers.
You, you and you.
Anybody got a cigarette?
Oh, anything for you, honey.
Mm.
Boy, I ain't had me a time like
this since we left Honolulu.
You remember Honolulu?
Yeah, what a time.
What a time. No place like it.
O'HARA: Remember those
clip joints we went to?
MARINE: And those dames
in all of them. What dames!
I'll never forget the one...
Come off it, you guys.
I don't go for that
dreaming stuff.
I'm gettin'
The blue Pacific blues
The feeling you get
from real bad news
I wanna hear bells
I wanna see trains
I get in this mood
whenever it rains
I'm gettin' the blues
Alone in the dark
and sultry night
You think of the times
you ain't done right
To add to the fact
you're feelin' so bad
The cry of the birds
keeps driving you mad
Part of the blues
You lie awake and how you wish
that it was mornin'
And then you smoke
a hundred cigarettes or more
That devil rain continues
pounding on your window
And the tropic winds
keep howling at your door
Regardless of all
the rain and mud
The feel of the place
gets in your blood
But deep in the night
there comes unawares
The terrible thought
that nobody cares
You're back with the blues
Again
To be even more specific
You've got what they call
The blue Pacific blues
DAVIDSON: Mr. Horn?
Tell those men
to leave that room.
I can't do that,
Mr. Davidson.
- It's your hotel.
- Miss Thompson paid her rent.
She has a right to invite her friends in
same as anybody else.
I will not allow her to turn
this place into a brothel.
Hiya, Mr. Davidson!
Nice to see you again.
Come and join the party!
Know all the boys here?
All right, you men,
leave this room.
- Huh?
- What did you say, Mr. Davidson?
You've no business in here,
any of you.
Just a minute. They're friends
of mine. I invited them in.
O'HARA:
What's the complaint, mister?
Leave this room, or I'll report you
to your commanding officer.
SADIE: They'll leave when they like.
Nobody invited you in!
You're a disgrace to your uniforms
being in this room with that woman.
- Now get out.
- What did you say?
What did you say?
I'll fight you right...
O'HARA: You don't talk
to Sadie like that!
SADIE:
Stop it, O'Hara! Stop it!
Will you cut it out?
O'Hara, stop!
That's enough. Stop it!
Did you hear what he said?
Huh?
You need to apologize
instead of yelling at me.
Take it easy, Sarge.
You wanna get hurt?
You crazy or what?
Trying to hit a civilian?
The party's over, O'Hara.
You bet it is.
Now, come on. Fold up.
I don't wanna be put off-limits.
If anybody was off-limits,
he was.
I'd be careful, Sadie.
He's a pretty important person
on these islands.
Davidson busted
a lot of people
who tried
to stand up against him.
He can buy and sell
anything or anybody.
I wouldn't attract his attention
any more than I had to.
Attract his attention?
He'd better not attract mine.
I've never known anyone
like him, and I don't wanna.
Come on. Call it a night before
Davidson shuts me up for good.
We were just warming up, Horn.
Good night, Sadie.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Come on, hurry up.
What a gal, huh?
- See you.
- What a gal.
- Where you going?
- I got to see Sadie.
- You just saw her.
- I wanna see her again.
Hurry up.
You guys wait outside.
Sadie?
Forget something?
Yeah.
To say good night personally.
Night.
I guess I was kind of loaded
when I roughed up Davidson.
Kind of?
Did I say something
I shouldn't to you?
Perfect gentleman.
Okay.
That's all I wanna know.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Come on, will you?
- Sadie? Sadie?
What did you forget
this time?
Tomorrow I'm off duty
at 10:00.
Can I pick you up for a swim
if it don't rain?
Supposing it does?
I'd still pick you up.
That's what I figured.
Come on, O'Hara. Get out here.
You wanna get me in trouble?
Did I say something
I shouldn't have?
Good night,
O'Hara.
Mr. Horn?
Mr. Horn?
Well, did the rain
cool you off, mister?
Say, what got into you,
busting into my room like that?
One of the boys really gonna
let you have it.
I had no other choice
under the circumstances.
What are you talking about?
"No other choice."
Who was bothering you anyway?
I'm afraid I can't let you
carry on as you wish.
Just what do you mean by that?
You lived in Honolulu,
didn't you?
Yeah, what about it?
What did you do there?
I had a job.
What kind of a job?
Part of the time,
I had a sort of singing job.
My voice isn't so awful
if you don't listen too hard.
Where did you work?
You mean
where did I sing?
I mean where did you work
in Honolulu?
Lots of places.
What places?
Nightclubs, mostly.
- What nightclubs?
- All kinds.
Why all these questions,
Mr. Davidson?
Why did you leave Honolulu?
Guess I wanted a change.
I've got a job waiting for me
in New Caledonia.
You wanted a change.
I'll tell you why.
Listen, I don't know why
I'm getting all this attention...
You're going to New Caledonia
to carry on your trade.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
I'm talking about why you
had to leave Honolulu.
You're a prostitute!
What?!
Who do you think you are,
calling me names?
You're a dirty rotten liar!
I'll want to give you
a chance to redeem yourself.
- Where do you get off with that talk?
- A chance to find salvation.
You're no priest or missionary!
You act like one,
but the collar don't fit!
Insulting me won't help you.
I've listened to you all I'm going to.
Now, you listen to me!
You lay off, or I'll show you what
it means when I start to get mad!
SADIE: How do you like that
double-talking, no-good louse?
Handing me a line like that.
If he starts that stuff again,
I'll really tell him off!
I'll spit in his eye!
- Mr. Davidson, sir.
- Governor.
I was hoping
you'd find time to drop in.
I'm afraid this
isn't a social call.
I suppose you came to see me
about that disturbance last night.
Major Kinner
has just assured me
that the Chinaman's place
will be declared off-limits.
At my insistence. No, this is
something else. Thank you.
A disreputable girl
from Honolulu
managed to escape deportation
and get on board the .
She's here now waiting for
the next boat to New Caledonia.
I suggest that you
do something about her.
I don't see
what I can do.
That girl must have a passport
or she couldn't have gotten this far.
- Revoke it.
- Not without legal cause.
I can't interpret the law
as you see it.
It is your duty
to protect the natives
and military personnel
stationed here.
This girl is a menace
to the welfare of both.
Why make her an issue?
You know we keep this island
well regulated.
I don't understand your concern
over this particular girl.
I suggest you visit
the native village
as I did this morning.
Ask the counsel to tell you
what effect she had
on the young men
and women
who witnessed her
outrageous behavior.
Do you realize where
this sort of thing leads?
Mr. Davidson, don't you think
we're a little more concerned
with immorality
than the natives are?
My father devoted his life
to the islands.
I'm not going to stand by
and see his lifework destroyed.
I'm not trying to destroy
anything, Mr. Davidson.
You're making your position
clear enough.
I have the greatest respect and
admiration for men like your father.
Truly religious men
who are kind, just, tolerant.
Then help me protect
what he accomplished.
I'm trying to,
within the limits of my authority.
But I must protect the legal
rights of every American citizen
who passes through here.
Governor,
I'm not a politician.
I wasn't appointed
to my job. I created it.
I envy you.
In any event,
this is not a marketplace
and we're not haggling
over prices.
As far as I'm concerned,
the issue is closed.
The decision, of course,
is yours.
Okay, kids.
Gum and candy.
Folks.
- Hi, Horn. Sadie in?
- She sure is.
Hey, Sadie, you decent?
Decent enough.
Come on in, O'Hara.
Compliments of
the quartermaster.
Hey, what is this,
moving day?
You guessed it.
Who says
you can't stay? Horn?
Horn's okay.
Don't tell me Davidson's trying
to take it out on you too?
He get you into trouble?
Griped to my C.O.
so I got some extra duty.
That's why I didn't
get here this morning.
That's okay.
Forget Davidson.
Let's go for that swim.
Where's your suit?
Hey, don't. I told you
I was moving!
He ain't shoving you out.
I invited myself
to check out.
Why?
Because I don't like the company here,
meaning Davidson.
I had a run-in with him
last night after you left.
What about?
You should have heard him
shoot his mouth off.
He can't do nothing to you.
Why run?
I don't want any trouble.
You sound scared of him.
He don't bother me.
I don't wanna get you
into hot water
every time you drop around
for a few laughs.
You mean you're moving out
on account of me?
How about letting me
finish packing?
I asked you something.
Let's say I'm doing it
for you and Horn.
I don't make friends
to get them into trouble.
Where do you figure
on shacking up?
Horn said they'd
put me up in the village.
Yeah,
I guess they would.
- What about a lift?
- What about it?
You got one.
How much do I owe you,
Mr. Horn?
- Forget it.
- Not me, I pay my way.
A couple of bucks
will do it.
For meals and everything?
This ain't exactly
the Ritz.
Look me up in my little grass shack
if you ever get into town.
Sure will.
Best of luck, Sadie.
- Give my love to Mrs. Horn.
- Yeah, you bet.
So long, folks.
Sorry to part company,
but I've been invited
to stay with friends in town.
- Good-bye. Miss Thompson.
- Good-bye.
Thank heaven she's gone.
She disturbed Mr. Davidson
horribly last night.
He despises women
of that kind.
The founder of our religion
was not so squeamish.
Robert, don't joke about
such things.
I don't believe the doctor
meant it as a joke.
No matter.
You do it.
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.
Oh, that's good. Can you?
All set?
Where do I check in?
It's no go.
What do you mean
"no go"?
I talked to the head
of the native counsels.
Seems they had a brawl there
last night
after some natives had
a couple too many...
But whats that
got to do with me?
Hey, don't tell me
Davidson was here
and blamed me
for what happened.
Yes, he did. Come on.
Well, I don't take no
for an answer that easy.
- I'm gonna go... Let go of me.
- Sadie, it's not use.
They won't put you up,
and there's nothing you or me
or anybody can do about it.
What have I got?
The measles or something?
As far as the natives,
are concerned, you're taboo.
- Taboo?
- Meaning hands-off.
Meaning they're scared
of Davidson. Well...
- Well, I'm not.
- Nobody said you were.
We got to get back to Horn's.
Don't worry about it.
Snap out of it.
You won't be out in the rain.
Sure.
I should worry.
That a girl.
Now you're talking.
Oh, please don't get up,
anybody. It's too hot.
- Hi, Sadie.
- Hi.
Did you see that look
Mrs. Davidson gave me?
Save me from females.
- Forget her.
- With pleasure.
Ooh!
Who turned up the heat?
It'll rain pretty soon.
How do you know?
Caught a piece of shrapnel
during the war in my leg.
Always tells me
when it's gonna rain.
You see much of the war?
Yeah, enough not to want
to see any more fighting.
Care for a drink, Sadie?
Oh, no,
not in this heat.
Help yourself to the bottles
in the suitcase.
No, thanks.
I don't touch it alone.
You mind if I relax?
No, I don't mind.
You know,
when I joined the Marines,
they told me
there'd be days like this.
Hey, it is raining.
Ah, let it. Rain, shine.
It's all the same in the tropics.
You got to learn to relax,
Sadie, like me.
Course, I've been here three years
and you only one day.
But I can give you a few pointers
on how to go native.
Yeah, yeah. Well,
some other time, Sarge, huh?
Okay.
I can take a hint.
But, you know, there's lots of
people come here for a vacation?
What you need
is to enjoy yourself.
Well, let's keep it friendly.
Believe me, friendship lasts
much longer than love.
Yeah, but it ain't as much fun.
I think you'd better go, Phil.
Can't I interest you at all?
I lost my curiosity
years ago.
You know, Sadie,
I like you.
Thanks.
I mean it.
It's tough trying to tell
somebody you like them.
- You know what I mean?
- Oh, sure.
I'm not asking for a medal
or something,
I just wanted you
to know how I felt.
Well, that's real
sweet of you, but...
I don't feel like
kidding around just now.
Who's kidding?
I said let's
keep it friendly, huh?
Sadie, if you don't like me,
just come right out and say so.
Oh, no, I like you fine.
Honest.
Well, then
what's the matter?
I was worried about Davidson.
Say, could he stop me
from going to New Caledonia?
I don't see how.
You, uh, got some guy waiting
for you in New Caledonia?
Oh, no,
I got nobody anywhere.
Same here.
If you wanna get away
from here in a hurry
there's a boat leaving
for Sydney in two days.
Australia,
where the kangaroos come from?
They got people there too.
And I'll be there
in a few weeks myself
just as soon
as I finish my hitch.
I got a deal to go
into the building business
with an old buddy of mine.
Needs a partner.
Yeah, but
he don't need me.
But work's easy to get and you
can stay with him and his wife.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
Just till you get set.
And by that time
I'll be there
and you won't have anything
to worry about.
Look, I pay my own way.
That's what I like about you.
But all I meant was
if you need any help,
I'll be right there.
What do you say?
You'll be out of here
in two days.
Sure. Why not?
What's the difference where I go
as long as I get there?
- Then it's a deal?
- It sure is.
Australia for me.
What do you want?
Me? I bring letter
for Miss Thompson.
Sadie, it's for you.
Who'd be sending me
a letter?
- It's the governor's office.
- Governor's office?
Sadie, what is it?
An order for my deportation on
the first boat to San Francisco
in three days.
The governor's
departing you? Why?
For the public good?
What's that mean?
I don't know.
But I know
who made him do it.
Getting me deported, huh?
- I've got some rights, haven't I?
- Hold it.
I'll show that miserable creep!
Not letting me alone?
I'll make Davidson
change that order!
- Now, you listen to me!
- I'll make him! I will!
One thing I learned
in the war,
when the enemy's dug in deep,
try to flank him.
Don't hit him head on.
We'll get around Davidson.
I don't want to go back.
I don't want to go back
to Frisco!
You're not going.
Once they stamp "deported"
on your passport,
you'll never get out
of the States.
It's a finish for you and me.
There'd be no chance
of getting together then.
I was counting on it.
Me and you in Australia.
I had it all mapped out.
Mapped out?
But that doesn't make sense.
You don't even know me.
What's that got to do with it?
A guy could know a girl
all his life
and never want to get near her.
I know you enough
not to want to lose you.
I'll talk to the governor
myself.
Nothing doing.
I got a half interest in this.
We're going in there
together.
- No! No, I don't want you to.
- Why not?
It'll only make it worse
if you get into trouble too.
Please, Phil,
you got to get back to camp.
Maybe you're right. I don't want
to get thrown in the brig now.
Look, you tell the governor...
I know how to handle it, honey.
All right.
Good luck, honey.
That goes for both of us.
Yeah. Yeah, for both of us.
I'll see you as soon
as I can wrangle another pass.
Yeah, okay.
I'd like to see the governor,
please. Miss Thompson.
Just a moment, please.
GOVERNOR: Come in.
The governor
will see you now.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Miss Thompson.
Sorry to break in on you,
governor.
Quite all right.
Guess you know
why I'm here.
Now, look, Miss Thompson,
no need to become upset.
You're only being asked
to leave this island.
Go home.
That's all the order means.
I don't want to go back
to the States just now.
You see, I've got a special
reason for getting to Sydney.
There's a fellow I'm gonna
meet down there.
We're gonna get married.
I mean as soon as he gets
out of the service.
You got to believe me!
If you send me
back to Frisco now
it'll maybe never work out
with us so far apart.
All I'm asking is you let me
stay here a few days more
so I can catch
the boat to Sydney.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Why?
What have I done
to be sent back for?
I can't change the order,
Miss Thompson.
Because of Davidson?
Because you're scared of him?
I heard how everybody
in the islands runs for cover
every time he shows up,
even including you!
I admire your spirit,
but not your tact.
It may not be polite,
but its the truth.
He made you do it by telling
a lot of lies about me.
It's useless to discuss it.
Now if you'll excuse me.
Sure! Don't even give me
a chance to square myself!
What did he say?
I've got a right to know.
Yes, you have.
He said you were
a disreputable woman
who'd escaped deportation
from Honolulu.
It's a lousy lie!
Just because I sang in
a nightclub in Honolulu
that was closed by the police.
What does that make me?
You know something?
It takes a low mind
to think low.
And Davidson's mind
is in the gutter!
He's only trying to do
his duty as he sees it.
I'll show you what I really
came down here for.
I got nothing to hide.
Here. Here's a letter from
my girlfriend in New Caledonia.
It's about that cashier job
I was going to
before I met this fella
and decided to go
to Australia instead.
Read it for yourself.
No, I believe you,
Miss Thompson.
Then you'll let me stay so
I can catch the boat to Sydney?
I have no objection,
if Mr. Davidson agrees.
But he won't!
You know he won't!
I'm sure if you explained
then Mr. Davidson
understood the situation.
I've always found him
to be fair.
Forgive me, Miss Thompson,
but as you see, I have a job to do.
Just be like
The three little monkeys
That grandmother had
On the shelf
If you hear of anything evil
Just keep it to yourself
So hear no evil
Have you had dinner,
Miss Thompson?
No. Thanks. Doctor.
I'm not hungry.
Speak no evil
That was very, very,
very good indeed.
Now, here we are.
Here's the candy.
CHILDREN: Thank you!
Say good night!
- CHILDREN: Good night!
- Good night.
I hate to interrupt your dinner,
but could I talk to you
for a minute please?
Certainly.
I'm sorry for what I said
last night,
sorry about everything
that happened.
I'm happy you feel that way,
Miss Thompson.
I went to see the governor,
he said I don't have to
go back to San Francisco,
if it's okay with you.
I'm afraid I can't
let you stay here.
All I'm asking
is you let me stay
until I catch the boat
to Sydney.
You don't know
what it means to me.
Just what does it mean,
Miss Thompson?
SADIE: Mr. Davidson,
I'll do anything you want.
Stay in my room,
not see anybody,
if that'll suit you.
May I see you alone,
Miss Thompson?
Just what are you trying to
say to me, Miss Thompson?
I'll go anywhere you want.
Anywhere.
Please don't make them
send me back to Frisco.
Why don't you want
to go back there?
There's-There's somebody
I don't want to see.
Somebody who'll get me
into trouble.
- What kind of trouble?
- All kinds.
Oh, you know, when a girl can't
shake off a man who's after her,
a man who's big and important
and wants things his way.
You're being evasive,
Miss Thompson.
What's the real reason?
- I told you.
- No, you haven't.
Yes, I have.
Mr. Davidson
if you send me back to Frisco,
this man's bound to find me.
You see I once worked for him
in a nightclub.
We got kind of friendly.
But then I...
Then I got tired of him
and broke it off.
He won't let me alone.
You're not deceiving me,
Miss Thompson.
Isn't this man you're
running from a policeman?
No. That's not true.
I can verify it
very easily
by cabling the authorities
back in San Francisco.
The truth is...
I didn't do anything.
This friend of mine, I was
with him when he stabbed a man.
They were gambling, drinking.
A fight started.
The police thought
I was in on it.
So I got away to Honolulu
before they could arrest me.
Mr. Davidson,
you were right.
I've done a lot of things
I'm not proud of.
But I'm trying to forget them.
I want to start over,
if you could help me.
I want to help you.
I wanna give you an opportunity
to start a new life.
You mean I don't
have to go back?
You must accept your punishment
for the life you've led.
You ran away to Honolulu and
your past caught up with you.
When you thought you were
safe here again it found you.
If you go to Sydney,
you still will not escape it.
There is no hiding
from justice.
But I didn't do anything
to go to jail for!
You lead an immoral life.
You must pay for it.
Only then will God forgive you.
What kind of God
are you talking about?
That's not the kind of God
I learned about in Sunday school.
The way you figure him out,
he's nothing but a cop!
Miss Thompson, you're caught
in a life of your own making.
You cannot escape yourself.
No one can.
You will only find peace when
you accept your punishment.
You tell me, "Be punished.
Go back and suffer."
How do you know
what I've suffered?
You don't know,
and you don't care.
And you don't even
ask me!
You don't want to know!
You'll never change me!
I'd sooner die than let you
make me over your way.
Nobody home.
It's me. O'Hara.
Oh, yeah, just a minute.
- Hiya.
- Hi.
I was just about
to hit the hay.
It's nice to see you.
Didn't think you'd be by so soon.
Not soon enough for me.
What's the scoop.
What did the governor say?
Ooh, just like I figured.
I got to go back to Frisco.
You mean he
wouldn't let you stay?
Couldn't talk him into it.
Say, how about a drink?
If I could find where you
put that bottle this morning.
What right's he got
to ship you out?
He's the governor,
isn't he?
Ah, here it is.
Have one.
I don't care
if he's a governor...
Now, no use getting
all worked up, honey.
Nobody's pushing you around.
Where you going?
They got laws on this island,
same as back in the States.
Maybe the governor
don't know it
but he's got to bring formal charges
against you to ship you out.
Don't go and see him.
It won't do any good.
And besides, it'll only
get you into more trouble.
What am I in now?
You being shipped to the States
and me heading for Australia?
It's no use.
It's not up to
the governor.
What do you mean
it's not up to him?
Well...
It just isn't.
Who then?
Davidson, is that it?
It's no use going to him.
I've tried.
He won't let me stay.
Why didn't you say so
in the first place? I'll talk to him.
Yeah, I got to go to jail.
I don't care about that.
Anybody can get fouled up.
Put in time and it's over.
But that other stuff.
Working in that Emerald Club
in Honolulu.
That can never wash off.
What about it?
Did you work there?
Did you?!
I sang there.
Now, leave me alone.
Sang?
I know the Emerald!
I had a straight job.
Straight job.
How come you picked
that joint to work
of all the clip joints
in Honolulu?
It paid the best.
Paid the best for what?
You know all the answers!
Why ask me?
A lot of stuff adds up now.
Scared to let me see
the governor with you.
Scared what Davidson
would tell me.
And perfume. Look at it!
Look at it!
All right, you want to know
the truth? I'll tell you.
Sure, I worked at the Emerald.
Took the men over
for all they had!
They filled the place,
millions of them!
They lined up in the streets and
all of them came just to see me!
Does that make you happy?
And when you asked me
to marry you, it was like...
It was like God had sent
somebody to take me by the hand.
Marry you?
How could I marry you?
You're dirty!
When I think of all the guys
who had their hands on you...
Get out. Get out of here!
Out of here! Out of here! Get out!
Out of here! Out of here!
Get out! Get out!
I'm sorry,
Miss Thompson.
Terribly sorry.
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his namesake.
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil
for thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table
before me,
in the presence
of mine enemies.
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me
all the days of my life.
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.
SADIE: Yes?
It's Dr. MacPhail.
May I come in?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
Glad to see you,
Miss Thompson.
You've become a sort of mystery
to us all,
shutting yourself up in here.
I was just wondering
if you're not feeling well
remember, there's
a doctor in the house.
Thanks, but I'm okay.
That Marine friend of yours,
Sergeant O'Hara, came to see me.
He still wants you
to go to Australia.
Well-Well,
he wouldn't understand.
I'm going back to San Francisco
and face what I've got to.
Are you sure you're doing
what you want to do?
Yes, I'm sure.
I understand why O'Hara's
worried about you.
Frankly, so am I.
You needn't worry
about me, doc.
I'm through running,
being scared.
Letting myself get hurt.
I'm past all that.
I know Mr. Davidson's
been talking to you...
He made me
see things different.
I must say,
Davidson puzzles me,
going from one extreme
to another.
Yeah, but you've got him
all wrong, like I did, Doc.
When O'Hara walked out on me
and I had nobody to turn to,
Mr. Davidson helped me.
He showed me
where I was heading.
At first I didn't listen.
All I heard was the rain...
falling harder...
and harder.
I thought
I was going to scream.
Then I began to listen
and things started to clear up.
Everything he said made sense.
I didn't feel lost anymore.
I'm back to myself again...
like I was...
long ago.
I think I understand,
Miss Thompson. Good-bye.
Good-bye.
That's the boat
to San Francisco, isn't it?
DAVIDSON: Yes.
I'm not afraid
to go back.
Not anymore.
I've searched myself
again and again
to make certain that I've asked
you to do the right thing.
I know there is no other way.
Yeah. I know it too.
Mr. Davidson, when you're
with me, I know it's right.
I'm not scared then.
But when I'm alone and don't
have you to talk to I...
Try to remember me
and all I've said.
Try to remember the peace
you've found.
Think of this place of communion
where I helped you
to find yourself.
I'd like to go now,
Mr. Davidson.
Yes, Miss Thompson.
I was scared you'd gone.
That I'd be too late.
There's a freighter loading
copper sailing in an hour.
I made a deal with the skipper
to take you to New Caledonia.
It's a short hop
from there to Australia.
Get your gear together
as fast as you can.
I'm going
back to the States.
Look, there's no time.
What happened between us
has nothing to do
with you getting away.
I don't want to get away.
I'm through running.
Sadie, the last couple of nights,
I've been up figuring,
counting all I've done.
It added up to one way.
I had no right to sound off.
Honey,
maybe knowing the worst
about each other
isn't such a bad way to begin.
It's got nothing
to do with that.
Mr. Davidson
gave me the courage
to finally face the truth
about myself.
What are you talking about?
I don't get it.
Well, Mr. Davidson
said the truth's the truth.
You can't run away from it.
That's what I've been
trying to do.
Run away from the truth
about myself.
I never wanted to face
what I became.
I was nothing but a tramp.
I told you it don't matter to me.
It matters to me!
Don't you understand?
Mr. Davidson says
I got to go back.
Accept my punishment.
That's the only way
I'll ever feel free inside.
I already feel better knowing
I'm gonna get it over with.
Don't make things tougher.
You're getting on that
freighter to Caledonia.
- Come on. Get your gear-
- No! No. I'm going to Frisco!
Oh, I want to do
what's right.
I'm telling you
what's right.
That's enough, Sergeant.
Miss Thompson's made her choice.
Choice nothing.
You got her all mixed up,
filling her with a lot of bilge!
Well, she's not going
back to the States,
- I'm getting her out of here.
- Are you?
Sadie, think of yourself.
Honey, that's all that matters.
No, Phil,
that isn't all.
I know you mean it for my good
and I appreciate it
but you don't understand.
You just don't.
Now, go. Please go.
You've made me very happy,
Miss Thompson.
You're strong enough
to withstand any temptation.
You were offered
a chance to escape
and you refused to take it.
I'd better get ready to leave.
Your boat won't
be sailing for an hour.
I can't stay here anymore.
I just can't.
I'm out of cigarettes again.
I better get some
to last me the trip.
Mr. Horn?
Mr. Horn?
They're all at the festival.
It's funny how I'm always
running out of cigarettes.
Sometimes I don't even know
I'm smoking.
I guess when something
becomes a habit
you don't think
what you're doing.
I'll never forget what you've
done for me, Miss Thompson.
You've justified my existence
by letting me save you.
You've given me more happiness
than I've ever known.
That's real nice of you,
Mr. Davidson,
especially after
all the trouble I gave you.
This time tomorrow,
you'll be on the sea.
Yeah.
I don't suppose
we'll ever meet again.
I suppose not.
Does it matter,
Miss Thompson?
I mean,
you're sure
of yourself now.
Yeah, I think so.
You won't be alone.
I'll be with you wherever you are.
I don't understand,
Mr. Davids...
Why do you
move away from me?
Well, I just want
to get my things.
I'm ready to go now.
You're not afraid of me,
are you?
After the last three days
I mean.
No.
No, I'm not scared of you.
Not anymore.
Then why do you
want to leave me?
It's got nothing to do with you,
Mr. Davidson.
I just want to get started,
that's all.
Oh, no.
I never wanted you to leave.
Never. I know that now.
No!
Don't touch me.
Don't come near me.
You're still the same.
I'm not the same!
Don't you see?
- I'm not the same!
- You're nothing but a rotten...
No!
Joe? Joe?
Go get Dr. MacPhail.
MARINE:
Make it snappy, Sarge.
- Horn, you hear Davidson killed himself?
- Yeah, I just heard.
- What about Sadie?
- What about her?
She get on that boat all right
or didn't she?
- I suppose.
- What do you mean you suppose?
How do you know
he didn't kill her too?
Come off it, O'Hara.
Sadie's on her way to Frisco!
Where's Davidson?
The natives left him on the beach
at the bottom of the cliff.
You can't help him now, Doc.
- Did you tell Mrs. Davidson?
- My wife's trying to.
Why do you think
a guy like Davidson
would knock himself off?
I don't care about Davidson.
What about Sadie?
I'm gonna get the C.O.
to radio that boat.
Sadie! Sadie!
Hi.
Hi, O'Hara.
What brings you
around so early?
Sadie, how come you're not
on the boat to Frisco?
My, my, don't the world
look fresh and clean today?
Look at that sky.
Just like a thing
wasn't going on under it.
Sadie, what happened?
I'll give you one guess.
Better turn that music off.
Mrs. Davidson's upstairs.
Why should I turn off the music
because she's upstairs?
What do I care about her
or Mr. Davidson?
- Sadie, somethings happened.
- You bet it has!
I've come back to my senses.
That's whats happened!
You men,
you're all alike. Pigs.
Sadie, Mr. Davidson
killed himself.
What did you say?
O'HARA: Sadie...
He killed himself?
What are you talking about?
Sadie, listen.
Let me alone!
- Let me alone! All of you!
- Sadie! Sadie! Sadie!
I don't care why Davidson
killed himself.
It doesn't matter to me
one way or the other.
It matters very much.
What made him take his own life
is of great importance to you.
I don't care.
If he hadn't done it, maybe
I would have killed him myself.
All that fancy gab
he gave me
about God and faith
and right and wrong.
- I know how you feel.
- Look, Doctor.
Will you do me a favor
and leave me alone?
Now, listen to me,
Miss Thompson.
You mustn't confuse
what Davidson did
with what he believed in.
He just couldn't practice
what he preached.
What does that prove?
Just the opposite of what you're
trying to make yourself believe.
I don't believe in anything.
I beg you not to let what
happened last night destroy you.
It's already destroyed
Davidson.
One thing he proved
by his death,
nobody can run away
from himself.
You talk like him.
Do I? I didn't realize.
All of us may run
as far as we can,
but in the end we always come
face-to-face with ourselves.
I'll see you,
Sergeant.
You're going to Australia.
There's nobody to stop you now.
Nobody, except myself.
But you don't have to go back
to the States, not anymore.
That's what you say.
That's what I mean.
You're okay now.
From now on,
it's you and me.
You're heading for Sydney.
You'll forget all this.
Sure, maybe I will,
but will you forget?
Give me a chance to,
will you?
Give me a chance,
Sadie.
Never mind the record player.
Keep it to remember me by.
Don't you worry, Sadie.
We'll remember you.
- Bye. Phil.
- Bye.
I'll be grabbing a plane
the minute I get my discharge.
See you in Australia
a month from now!
MARINES:
Good luck! Good luck. Sadie!
- So long, Sadie!
- Good-bye!
Good-bye!
O'HARA:
, Sadie!
