My idiot.
All the contracts are ready, right?
Pertect. l'm going to go
over each one of them.
Yes.
Hmm.
And the documents from the
Bangalore office? Yeah. Okay.
Hi.
- Just a second.
lshaan, where is your wallet?
Milkman's dues.
Why should l pay him?
l don't even drink milk.
ln fact, l even have my coffee black.
Listen, l'll just call you back.
lshaan, please.
l mean it.
How can you be so cheap?
l make your breakfast everyday.
And your black coffee
as well, by the way.
Sweetheart, l am so good that..
..not just you, any girl l
know would do anything for me.
Bye.
Sir.
Sister-in-law, shall l come tomorrow?.
What sister-in-law?.!
Which sister-in-law?.!
l am no one's sister-in-law, okay?
Sister-in-law!
Hi, Sweetheart.
- Good morning, sir.
Good morning, sir.
- Hi. - Your bag? - Good morning.
ls she in?
Yeah, she is just waiting.
Good. Good. Good.
Hey Beena.
What's up?
Come on, lshaan. This is no
time to walk in. You are late.
Of course not.
Our meeting is scheduled for
Oh, one second.
You don't have the
confidence to work without me.
Anyway, this is a music company
and not a multinational bank..
..where l've to land up
early in the mornings.
Okay?
So, don't even expect that.
l don't expect anything from you.
You are not worthy of it.
Look, in spite of you being with them..
..this company has hired me on a
higher salary with more perks.
So that l can put you in your place.
A fair chance has to be given, right?
Can you just help me with this, please?
lshaan, the sooner you know
your position, the better.
Look baby, without me this
company's and your state..
..will be same as a ship without a
captain in the middle of the sea.
You'll be caught seesawing like this.
With a SOS board around your neck.
You understand?
We'll see.
And what shit are we
listening to, today?
What's in store for
today's crappy audition list?
Here are some photographs.
Like this one.
She can modulate
really well and l like..
We aren't looking for a
model for a fairness cream.
Auditions, please.
And do you know what he told me?
''Why should l pay him? ln fact,
l even have my coffee black.''
Can you believe it?
''l even have my coffee black.''
l was like.. - Just leave him,
Anushka. You deserve much better.
Yeah, l know. Sometimes
l really feel l should..
But l love him.
Oh he's..
Fine then, suffer.
Anyway, hows aunt? l
haven't met her since ages.
She's good.
l'm going to Pune
next week. Come with me.
No.
l'll go with lshaan.
To talk about our marriage..
Just grow up, girl!
Shivs. Come on.
How can you be so negative about him?
You are his sister.
l know him well because l am his sister.
And l am not negative.
All l know is that he is not
at all prepared for marriage.
You know Shivani, all
guys are commitment phobic.
All of them.
But after marriage
everything figures itself out.
And.. lshaan too will change.
Hey, nice bag.
Beautiful.
Really?
- Yeah. - Me or the bag?
l spoke about you yesterday..
l don't know whether the
song matches her style.
Excuse me.
- But technically she is brilliant.
Hey, lshaan's got a lovely house. Yeah?
Hey, Anushka.
Hey. What's happening?
lshaan's office party.
- Where's lshaan?
He probably..
He went to the bedroom.
Bedroom?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Don't worry.
Come on. lt's coming.
lt's coming. Just relax.
Relax. Relax. Relax. - lshaan..
Relax. Relax. Relax.
- lshaan?
Better? Yeah? lt's there? Yeah. Yeah.
Stinks.
lshaan, what's this?
Weren't you the one who was
saying that you have to do everything?
That l don't do anything for this house.
Look, l organized this party.
And l am trying to keep the house clean.
Don't worry, baby. Don't worry..
Couldn't you have told me?
- Here.
Who is she?
- l don't know.
Okay, guys, listen.
Listen, Listen. Hear me out.
Yeah? Yes?
lf we want we can make
Beena go away in two days.
Only if we want. Yeah?
l can discuss it with the board.
- Yeah, dude.
Whatever.
- We have you.
Dude, let's go for it.
- Who needs her? - Come on!
Cheers!
- Cheers!
Cheers!
Anushka.
- So let's do that.
Oh thanks.
- Let's do exactly that.
What do you think?
Correct, right? Yeah?
- So, long day?
l told you.
l had too much. My head..
lshaan..
lshaan!
Yes?!
lshaan..
Shall we go to Pune today?
- Pune?
Why?
- To meet your parents.
lf we leave by 6:30pm,
we'll reach by 9:30pm.
ln time for dinner.
Going there on a suicide mission?
Ouch.
Look, we are going to Pune. Okay?
lt's been three years.
l need a proper commitment, lshaan.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Pune.
Pune, right?
- Yes.
lt's time for my squash game. Can l go?
- Squash?
lshaan, l am not joking.
Alright. Pune. Okay.
l'll wait, okay?
'Hi, this is lshaan Sabharwal.
lf it's good looking it's me.'
'Don't leave a message.
Just call back later.'
Hi, how you doing?
Hey.
Hey.
- Hey.
Hi, how are you?
- How are you?
Meet my friend Ekta.
Hi.
- Hi.
lshaan..
You are leaving.
- Then what.
How long should l wait for you?
Then don't. Come with me.
- Where to?
To your house.
- That's it?
Come on.
Oh shit! Anushka!
Who Anushka?
Mrin, l've gotta go.
Are you serious?
Are you throwing me out of the car?
You gotta go.
Why?
- Because l've gotta go. Go.
Asshole!
What?
l can't open the door.
l think it's stuck.
lt's not stuck, lshaan. l've locked it.
What? Lock? Why?
Because this is my flat.
And you're not welcome here anymore.
What the hell!
Anushka!
Anushka!
Anushka!
Anushka..
Anushka..
Anushka!
l'm sorry.
l'm really, really, really sorry.
Sorry? What for?
For coming home late.
For making you wait.
For not going to Pune.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
l should've told you.
l should've sent you a message.
You..
You are so kind,
so loving, so patient..
You are so beautiful.
You're so full of shit.
Anushka, the thing is l
couldn't sleep the entire night.
l was.. l was so disturbed, you know.
And one thing more.
l kept thinking about us.
Can l come in and
have a cup of coffee?
Please, baby?
Then we can relax and talk.
As long as you want. No?
l can't do this anymore, lshaan.
What can you not do?
- l..
You can't make coffee? l'll make it.
You'll never change.
This is all ajoke to you?
But this isn't ajoke to me, lshaan.
This is my life.
What is wrong if l..
..want someone to be with me?
Someone who wants to talk
to me about my feelings.
And perhaps someday make a life with me.
What's wrong with it, lshaan?
Tell me. l..
l can't deal with this anymore.
l..
- Anushka..
Please don't cry.
l'm not crying, you idiot!
Who's the best? Who's the best?
lshaan's the best.
Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.
Beena.
Beena..
You know Sukanya?
Hi.
- Sukanya..
Hi.
- Sukanya.
The most promising voice.
Sing.
Here?
Hmm.
''My name is Sheila.''
''Sheila's youth..''
''l'm too sexy for you.''
''You can't get me.''
''No. No. No. Sheila.''
''Sheila's youth..''
''l'm too..''
- Can you sing the happy birthday song?
Yes.
Sing.
''Happy birthday to you.''
''Happy birthday to you.''
''Happy birthday to you.''
- Like a 5 year old?
''Happy birthday to you.''
''Happy birthday to you.''
''Happy birthday..''
- That's enough.
''Happy birthday.''
''Happy birthday to you.''
What was that?
- Auditions.
You know my dog Bugsy?
lt's his fifth birthday.
And he loves live pertormances.
You are insulting a talent, Beena.
For a dog's birthday party?
l'm giving your ''Find'' a chance.
lt's going to be a big party.
A lot of dogs with be there..
To wag their tails.
And yes, you addressed me as ''baby''.
l can sue you for that.
Just saying.
What!
Hey, Rishi, give me. Give it to me.
Mom's here.
Good that Anushka dumped you.
Rishi, if you are done eating, you
can go inside and wash your hands.
You are done.
- Okay, Mom.
Shivani, you know, you have
started behaving just like mom.
And have started
looking like her as well.
Absolutely. Ditto copy.
Actually, it's my fault that
l introduced you to Anushka.
l lost our friendship
because of your deeds.
Deeds?!
You know..
Anushka deserves much better.
Someone who is a grown up and
doesn't pass okra under the table.
Shall l remind you that you
stopped your law practice five years ago?
And what do you do?
You fill this world with cheap music.
Wow lshaan, so impressive.
How d..
And anyway, Anushka didn't dump me.
lt's just a small misunderstanding.
That's all.
She changed the lock.
You changed the lock!
How d..
Did you call Anushka?
She changed the lock, man.
Oh really?
Do you love her?
Huh?
Oh, shit!
l was on level 5. Did
you see what you just did?
lshaan, Do. You. Love. Her?
We looked good together.
We were good together.
l wonder why she
wants to ruin everything.
She wants to ruin it?
Have you seen the condition l'm in?
l'm on your sofa.
l don't have a toothbrush.
Pizza's over.
And your beer isn't cold either.
lshaan, this situation
is a little serious.
You'll have to reverse it.
And this is what you do.
This is what you are
good at. Come on, man.
You'll have to do something.
Hey Anushka, it's me, Tarun.
Please open the door.
l called. You didn't answer it.
Shoes. Shoes. Clothes.
Clothes. DVDs. Protein powders.
And your 42 inch life
support system is also packed.
And my lazy boy?
That is all that belongs to you, right?
Take it. l hate it anyway.
Okay?
Keep it.
So sir, are you staying
alone for the first time?
Total freedom.
No one to nag you. No one to talk to.
So l'll get the agreement
ready and send it to your office.
Okay? Bye.
Who's the best? Who's the best.
lshaan! lshaan! lshaan!
So..
You are my new neighbor.
lshaan Sabharwal.
Music producer. CMC records.
Gauri Dandekar.
Stylist and.. part time electrician.
Part time electrician?
Yeah. The wiring of
this building is bad.
lf fuse ever blows out,
don't hesitate to call me.
Don't worry. l won't charge you.
lt's not my profession. lt's my passion.
Oh hey..
Welcome to the building.
What is this for?
Keeps the noise out.
Are you going to make me do a
lifetime's exercise in a day?
This problem is being caused by Anushka.
That movie is out of the theatre, boss.
Yes. Because l've
shut down that theatre.
How long should l run after her?
By the way, Your neighbor,
what's her name?
Gauri.
- Yes. Hows she?
She's average.
Oh really? - Yes. - Then
what are those earplugs for?
l don't know. She must be
doing acrobatics at night.
Who cares?
What the..
Hello! What's happening?
Hello! Can't you hear me?
Hey, l'm asking you guys.
What are you guys doing?
What's happening?
They can't hear you.
Simple physics.
That drill's volume is
much louder than your voice.
What the..
Hey! Whoa! Where are you going?
Are you going to stop them?
What's so funny?
Nothing.
You know this is the
problem with people.
l mean when these guys don't work,
people cause a commotion.
And when these guys work,
people aren't happy.
Come on, it's not like they
enjoy working all night long.
They are not partying, right?
That's not my problem.
What an attitude!
''lt's not my problem.''
lf l knew the broker was going
to get such a grumpy neighbor..
..then l would have shifted out of here.
You called me grumpy?
You called me grumpy?
There's no one else here
other than me and you.
So it's obvious, isn't it,
that l called you grumpy.
Don't worry.
l'm going to call you all
kinds of things in the future.
And you know what, slowly
you'll start to like my blabbering.
Like, right now, l'm blabbering..
..and you can't even
hear the noise outside.
You know what, just use
the earplugs and go to sleep.
Oh, by the way..
Nice boxers.
Yeah?
lshu..
How are you?
l hope you're fine.
Mom? What are you doing here?
Your sister told your dad everything.
He even came to know about Anushka.
No one tells me anything.
But good that you left that girl.
l never liked her.
What's wrong, lshu? You look unwell.
l hope you are feeling fine.
Mom, l..
- Yes?
Don't worry. Now that l'm here,
everything will be fine.
Come on, move aside now.
Mom..
Your dad must be up by now.
He must be wondering where l am.
You didn't tell dad?
Your favorite bread.
Mom, you got this plate
and cup from home, from Pune?
Then what. l got all the
plates and cutlery with me.
lshu, what's this? There's no water.
ls this building like
those places where..
..there is water only
at a particular time.
Oh, no. l should've
brought a bucket as well.
Kitchenware is available in Mumbai.
You know that, don't you?
At double the cost.
Anyway your dad is
staying alone in Pune.
How many plates will he use?
lf he could have his way, he would
never let me out of the kitchen.
After all, l'm just his servant.
Mom, what are you saying?
Think before you speak.
Ever since your dad has retired..
..he has made my life miserable.
lt's either a pain in the
head or a pain in the neck.
Sometimes he wants to have
fritters and sometimes it's porridge.
lf your dad can retire
then why can't l? - Mom..
Let your dad go to hell.
Now l'm not going to move from here.
From where?
From here.
From Mumbai. From your flat.
And dad?
- l've left him.
What!
Oh no! What have you done!
You dropped everything.
See, the melamine plates
we get in Pune are so good!
Unbreakable.
Look, lshu, you are all grown up now.
You can understand.
l will not go back to your dad in Pune.
l'll stay here, with you.
So you can sing.
Anything else?
Excuse me?
Fashion sense. Style. Sex appeal.
All these are necessary
to become a hit singer.
Right?
l'm just a singer.
l don't know anything else.
l don't understand.
Shona.
Yes.
Big star.
l know.
Do you listen to her music?
Yes.
- She also didn't know anything before.
l made her a big star.
Do you know how?.
Amala, do you want to see
your poster in a music store?
Your billboard at every crossing?
Do you want people to buy your music?
Yes.
Good. Then from now on, stop thinking.
l'll do the thinking for you.
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Yes.
Yes.
Good.
Sir..
Keep it. lt's yours.
Farhad. What is this ''Save the
tiger'' donkey doing with Anushka?
Agastya? He came with her.
You okay?
Yeah.
Last week he caught four
tiger poachers, all by himself.
lndian Rambo, man.
Too good.
Here, have a drink.
- Thanks.
lt will ease the heartache.
Cheers.
Bastard. He's
encroaching on my territory.
Last week you said that
it's all over for you.
And now you are feeling jealous.
Don't think.
Anyway you are not used to it.
l'm going there. Hold this.
- lshaan.
Forget it. lshaan.
Really, l swear.
Hi, lshaan.
You remember Agastya, right?
Can l talk to you?
- Yeah.
lshaan..
- What is Agastya doing here?
l thought you are
through with the tiger project.
Look, l volunteer with his organization.
And l do legal work. You know that.
Since when? What else? Have you
turn into a vegetarian as well?
Actually, yes.
You inviting him for my
friend's party, what does that mean?
Look, Farhad is also my friend, lshaan.
And l don't mean anything by it.
l mean l was going to a
party to l brought him with me.
That's all. Just a friend.
Friend?
Really? Miss. Meerut? That's so modern.
So how does he pertorm?
Better than me?
l can't talk to you.
You are such a child!
Anushka, shall we?
Yeah, l think l'm done here.
Let's go.
What are we doing here?
We are men, Tarun. Men.
We are marking our territory.
Oh really?
Even dogs do that, don't they?
They pee under a tree
and mark their territory.
What a life l have!
Look! That lying..
No, lshaan, let it be. Let's go.
Be careful, dear.
What's happening, Mom?
lshu, you know that serial..
The serial, ''Stars and
the moon, for you''..
''Dark nights for me''.
- Yes. - Today is its final episode.
Yes, so l thought we'll have
a serial party in our house.
l've even made 'Samosas' .
You didn't have a cable connection.
Look at Gauri, she's
getting the cable down.
She is pulling a connection
from the junction, for me.
Mom! Mom, what's wrong with you?
You are stealing a cable connection!
- No! No! No!
They will throw me out
of the flat in two days!
l'm not stealing it,
son. lt's just for today.
You don't have to do this.
lt's okay.
No, it's not okay. Please..
Gauri.
- Gauri.
l'll handle it.
Let men do the manly jobs.
Okay.
- Okay, Mr. Man.
Do you always yell at aunt
in this manner? - Sorry?
Not to me, say it to aunt. ''Sorry.''
Oh, by the way, l like your style.
lt was a nice act,
you forgetting my name.
''Mr. Man.'' ''The act
for forgetting my name.''
Early morning blabbering.
Didn't even let me have coffee.
Whose house is it, huh?
Hello?
Yes? Do you want something?
The ladder. Sorry, l kept it inside.
Should l get it? -The ladder?
Please. What will l do with it?
lt's hardly 10 feet.
l jump from a height
of 10 feet every day.
So, why did you call me?
- l brought the cable down.
Wow! Ten out of ten!
What happened?
- Nothing.
Ouch!
''Move a little, shake a little.''
''Come into my arms.''
''Don't you wanna know, what's
the secret hiding in my eyes?''
''What are you thinking about?''
lshaan, change her track.
How will this poor girl sing this?
lt's just not her.
l'll do something.
lshaan..
Amala..
Why are you so nervous?
lshaan, l can't do it. Please.
Amala, your voice is good.
You just need to modulate a little.
l can't do it.
lshaan, l'm.. l'm just a flop..
Listen, just imagine..
That this is the only
chance you have to sing.
You'll never get such a chance again.
This is your only chance.
This is it.
You got it? You will do it?
Yes.
- Good. Go for it.
Synthesize a little
and add some more beats.
Then it will be same as the
song Shona sang last time.
That ''Life..'' song.
That was last year's best track.
And l had cracked it.
That's true. Somehow your
decisions have always worked.
Fine then. Let's begin.
Awesome.
- Was it?
Yes.
- Oh, my God.
Yeah.
Yes, Tarun.
- Who is this?
Behave yourself.
Can you hear me?
Hey!
- Hey! How are you?
Good to see you.
- That's for you.
Thank you so much.
Good. Yeah, everybody is inside.
Oh, are they?
- Yeah. - Good.
Hey! Hi!

Anyway. That's my dad.

Ex-boyfriend.
Another ex.
And before you say anything, let me

So, shut up.

Good night. -Thanks for coming.
So?
What do you want to do?
Agastya, you're my friend. You tell me.
l can't understand anything.
l'm confused.
Anushka, there's nothing to understand.
Just tell him.
Tell him.
l should tell him?
Excuse me, sir.
Thank you.
What should l tell him?
That, ''l know you
don't want to marry me.''
''You don't want children.
But guess what?''
''l'm pregnant.''
''We are going to have a child.''
Anushka, you know that
he has a right to know.
He has no right.
lt's over between us.
He.. He doesn't even love me.
Anushka, he deserves to know.
Tell him. Give him one last chance.
He does.
Okay.
Oh, my God. Anushka.
Did you.. Did you tell lshaan?
No. Not yet.
You know him.
l wonder how he will react.
What do you mean by how will he react?
lt's his child. He'll
have to act responsible.
You must tell him.
Careful, Ms. Beena.
Fasten your seatbelt.
Otherwise, chances are that what
you'll hear will blow you away.
Wow. l'm really excited!
Clap. Clap.
Amala.
''Look at the way l move my body.''
''Look at the way l groove.''
''This is intoxicating.''
''ln this inebriety,
everybody let your body loose.''
''Move a little, shake a little.''
''Come into my arms.''
''Don't you wanna know, what's
the secret hiding in my eyes?''
''What are you thinking about?''
''Expunge this distance.''
''Don't let this night go waste.''
''Don't lose this moment.''
''Look at the way l move my body.''
''Look at the way l groove.''
''This is intoxicating.''
l don't think she has a promising voice.
So?
l definitely cannot
sign on Amala's contract.
You'll have to.
Yes, Shivani.
Excuse me. - lshaan, why do you
always take so long to answer?
Can't speak now.
Dinner at my place. Tonight.
Yeah, okay. Dinner. Fine.
Thank you.
Here you go.
You must've said thank you
and l must not have heard you.
So, you're welcome.
Thank you. Sorry.
So many?
- There's a scientific logic behind it.
See, l want to have three shots.
So, for company sake you'll
have three pegs of whiskey.
But because you are a man..
lf you would've gone to get them,
you would've gone thrice.
l've done it in one go.
Simple female logic.
All you do is give
everyone a piece of your mind.
What's wrong with you?
Don't be such a cry baby.
Have a drink.
You know what, you should
have confidence in yourself.
Confidence.
What?! She's hot.
To understand beauty you need to see it.
Look at her.
So, won't you flirt with her?
No. Not my type.
So you won't mind if l
flirt with her, right?
What!
Whoa. Wow.
Hi.
You know what?
My friend there..
- Yeah?
He thinks you're really hot.
Check him out.
Hi!
Yeah, Shivs?
lshaan, where are you?
You were going tojoin us
for dinner, weren't you?
Actually, Shivs..
- Listen. Anushka is also here.
And she wants to talk to you.
Sojust come here.
Now!
She so wants me back.
Finally!
What took you so long?!
- Hi! Your sister?
Nice to meet you. Nice house.
Oh hey.
Anushka, don't rush him.
Hi, guys.

- Hi.
Do you want a drink?
Yeah, sure. Thank you.
Beautiful wall.
Hey, lshaan.

Oh, my God, Paris. lshaan..
l've always wanted to go.
Gauri, look, what a beautiful wall.
l love Paris.
- Come on.
Okay, we start from here.
- Cheers.
Thanks.
- How do we go to Paris from here?
See this!
Straight down and then take a
turn left.. - Left and then right.
What..
- Hey, we meet here.
Gauri..
You're so cute.
- Me?
Okay, now we start again.
Good idea.
- Okay. - Are you coming with me?
Now from Paris we go back to London.
- Let's go.
And from London to New York.
No, wait. Let me handle it.
- Then? Go back, back, back..
lshaan.
Just a minute, please.
- You okay?
l'll see you.
- Yeah. Yeah. Go. Go!
Shivani will take care of the situation.
She knows her brother well.
lshaan, Anushka wants to talk to you.
About Agastya and herself?
Shivs, you continue
with your friendship.
l'm done with her.
And tell her l've forgiven her.
And if she is jealous to
see me happy.. l don't care.
Please lshaan, what are you saying..
l'm not used to sulking.
Just look at her.
lshaan.
- Shivs, she's really boring.
As boring as ever.
Listen, Anushka..
- lshaan..
lshaan.. Sorry. Brother-sister talk.
Yeah. - l'll go and
entertain your other friends.
Yeah. l'll come with you.
But lshaan..
- Really? - Yeah. Yeah.
Come. Come.
- lshaan, l'm very hungry.
Come on, l know a place.
- Yeah?
Come. Come. Come on.
Okay, guys.
She can't stay hungry for long.
Bye. Bye. Bye.
Come on.
Just a minute. - Come on. - Bye.
Bye guys. Nice seeing you all
Bye, Sister.
- Angry sister.
Come on, let's go.
l told you. Leave him.
l'm so sorry, Anushka.
Relax.
l don't need him.
Not just him, l don't need anyone.
Come on, Anushka. How will
you handle it all by yourself?
Yeah, l mean.. Why?
l am successful.
l earn well.
What's the problem?
l.. l need a family.
And now my family will consist of me..
And my child.
Come on, let me help you.
- No. No.
Let me help you.
- No.
Okay.
- l'm fine.
One, two.
- Okay. You are fine.
Gauri..
No. l'm not drunk. See.
One, two, three.
Hey!
What?
lshaan..
l know l am drunk and all that.
But it doesn't mean that
l've lost all my senses.
l.. l mean we are friends..
..but that doesn't mean
l'm going to sleep with you.
So when would you sleep with me?
What!
What's so funny?
Day after tomorrow?. How about Monday?
Or Wednesday?
l mean isn't there anything
else in life other than this?
Yeah right.
lshaan. lshaan, don't behave like this.
Come on, lshaan.
Hey! lshaan.
Let's be mature about this.
Oh seriously?
Hello?
Yes.
Yeah. Yeah, l'm very busy right now.
Exactly. l told you. l'm busy.
Like l was saying that, you know..
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Hello?
- A human heart weighs only 250 grams.
lt pumps 5 liters of blood every minute.
Any extra pressure
causes high blood pressure..
..while ultimately
leads to cardiac arrest.
Commonly known as heart attack.
What do you mean?
- Simple.
Don't feel guilty and try to
run away, and say sorry. - Sorry.
Sorry that..
- Sorry that..
l left you alone in
the middle of the night.
l left you alone in
the middle of the night.
l didn't even ask you
how you reached home.
How did you reach home?
l took a rickshaw.
l am really, really, really sorry.
lt's okay.
But the next time we go out,
l keep the car keys.
Okay?
Okay.
- Dumbo.
We have some options.
This works best.
- Six more layouts. - Okay.
Why haven't you still
signed Amala's contract?
Why don't you get it?
She's the voice.
l didn't like her voice. Remember?
That's why l am launching..
Sukanya.
l brought her here.
And you invited her to
your dog's birthday party.
Sharp memory.
She attended the party and
my Bugsy and his friends..
..loved her singing.
You can't launch her.
Sukanya's my find.
Really? Then why didn't you pursue her?
You brought ten more girls after her.
And then you started pushing Amala.
l will launch Sukanya.
You can help me if you want.
Help? You can't handle it alone?
l am sorry, Beena, but
if you have decided..
..to take this company
down then l'm not with you.
l'm not with you.
Not even for a minute.
Okay. As you wish.
l've never bossed you around.
So l can't force you to stay.
All the best.
All the best to you and your company.
We quit.
Come on, guys.
Sleeveless blouse.
She wears her sari below the navel.
A falling veil.
She thinks she's hot shit.
You have observed her very closely.
Please, that's not true.
l've done so much for CMC music.
l was the biggest
producer in that company.
No one noticed my sacrifices.
l told her bye.
See you around. l quit.
l, me, myself.
Will you just keep talking or will you..
..give others a chance
to praise you as well.
You like Amala?
- Yeah. l think she's a sweet kid.
But it's not like l find
her attractive or something.
You know.
Hey, Mr. One-Track-Mind.
l meant Amala, the singer.
Yeah, of course.
You believe in her?
- Then what!
Would l spend so much
time on her otherwise?
Then just go for it, lshaan.
- Huh?
l mean you are interested in her
so it's okay if CMC music isn't.
Launch her.
''Launch her?''
- Yeah.
Are you crazy, Gauri?
You don't know anything
about the music industry.
l'll have to do a lot of hard work.
l'll have to spend a lot of money.
''Launch her.'' Crazy.
Well, Mr. Music-Executive..
Work instead of crying.
Take risks.
Put your money where you mouth is.
Lazy ass.
l'm not talking to you.
Really?
- Really.
But you are.
- No.
No?
- l..
Gauri, l think my son is upset with you.
Hmm.
All the boys are the same.
Yeah, l am an idiot, right?
Yes, you are.
- Yes. Thank you.
Papa is too. Mummy called
papa an idiot in the car.
Huh?
Son, don't tell your mummy
that you had pizza here, okay?
My baby.
He is also my baby.
And what about me?
You are my baby as well.
All three of you are my babies.
lshaan..
You can do it.
Everything will be fine.
Thanks.
Uncle lshaan, l had a bad dream.
A bad dream? ln my house?
But l've already called
the Monster control unit..
..and banished all the monsters.
No, they are still there.
Oh really?
- Yeah.
Granny is sleeping?
- Yes.
She's making loud noises.
- Really?
Louder than papa's.
Do you know what l do if l
feel scared of anything?
What?
- l box it.
Like this.
Take this, bad dream!
Take this, you monster!
Who's the best?
Who's the best? Rishi is the best.
Rishi is the best.
- Uncle lshaan, l love you.
You are a super hero.
l love you, too.
Beautiful. Awesome.
She's looking good, right?
You are happy.
Lean in forward.
Chin up. Gauri.
- Chin up.
Excuse me.
- Lovely.
lshaan.
- Listen,
l wanted to talk to you.
Not now. l'm working.
- Turn to me.
But..
- Yes. - Wait for me over there.
Hold.
- Please.
Okay.
- Little on your right.
Lovely.
That's nice. Very good.
You play the piano?
Sojust like that?
l always wanted to learn.
As a child l had a dream
of becoming a musician.
Then?
- l grew up.
And?
- Dreams changed.
Like?
- Like you know..
Money, success, etcetera, etcetera.
Well, then it's
never too late, you know.
You should always do what you like.
No regrets.
Today, l'll give you
your first piano lesson.
You play the piano?
l know one music piece.
Do you wish to learn or not?
- Okay.
Okay. Left hand.
Yeah. Ready.
Gauri, you are right.
l should launch Amala.
And l will.
That's good.
And..
l didn't quit my job.
l was bluffing about my
resignation and she caught it.
So basically, l was fired.
So.. you need my help with Amala?
Yes. Yes, please.
Okay.
Just go.
Oh God.
Give me that.
- But..
l'll hit you.
- Okay. - Go. Go!
''l'm so into you, it's frightful..''
''lt makes every moment delightful.''
''You immortalize my heart..''
''My love.''
''l'm so into you, it's frightful..''
''lt makes every moment delightful.''
- At least say it now.
''You immortalize my heart..''
''My love.''
- Master, you are great!
''Without you..''
- Come on.
Working, right?
- ''My life seems incomplete.''
''Without you..''
''l'm estranged with myself.''
''Come, touch with your eyes..''
- Come on! Gauri.
Gauri. What are you doing? Gauri.
''My dreams..''
- Gauri.
Gauri!
- ''My love.'' - Shhh! Be quite
Come in the pool.
Okay. Okay. Coming. Coming.
- ''Come, keep your smiles on my lips.''
''Let me live the moment.''
- Come.
Wow!
- ''My love.''
Good boy.
- You wanna play?
No! No! No!
- ''My love.''
You know, when l was in Sophia college..
..l used to skip college and
come here with my friends.
Mom, did you ever have a boyfriend?
l mean before dad.
Your dad wasn't my boyfriend.
From being a strange,
he became my fiance.
And then we got married. Mom.
- Yes?
Do you not love dad anymore?
Of course l love him.
But sometimes, just love isn't enough.
What do you mean?
Look lshu, all relationships
have to have a two-way traffic.
You should get as
much as you give, right?
Love is so awesome.
You don't say a word to each other..
..and yet you are so
close to each other.
That kind of a silence is bliss.
''You are my reason to live.''
''You are the morning to my night.''
''You are my home.''
''My love.''
''Without you..''
''My life seems incomplete.''
''Without you..''
''l'm estranged with myself.''
lshaan. Meet Taruni,
my girlfriend. And..
We wanted you to be the
first person to get this news.
We are engaged.
''Come, touch with your eyes..''
- Sexy.
''My dreams.''
- Hey! What? lshaan!
''My love.''
- You think l'm sexy?
''Come, keep your smiles..''
Come on. Leave.
''On my lips.''
- l told you. l told you.
''Let me live the moment.''
''My love.''
''My love.''
''Make your every dream come true.''
''My love.''
Heavy looks are being exchanged.
Tarun, l really like her, dude.
Yes, l can see that.
No, l mean, l seriously, really,
really like her.
Well done, man.
l'm really proud of you.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One. Two. Three. Go.
Cut. Cut.
Cut. Cut. Cut.
Guys, please take five minutes, okay?
Amala, just relax.
Amala, what's happening?
Can't you even pertorm
two steps while singing?
lt's not so, lshaan.
For me this song is..
- What?
lshaan, Rafiq and l
have tried something new.
Would you like to hear it?
Okay.
''lmpressions on the heart..''
''lmpressions on the heart..''
''lmpressions on the heart..''
Stop. Stop. Stop.
What is wrong with you?
Your launch show is in three days.
And you think this is ajoke.
l know the market
better than all of you.
Now come on, get on with your work.
Okay, everybody. From the top.
Hi, lshaan.
We don't need the
formality of an interview.
l'll hire you straight away.
l know you..
You have come here
looking for ajob, right?
Who will need ajob..
Who's business will go bust..
Amala's launch will tell it all.
Do come!
Not bad, Shivs.
Staying with Adil you've
learnt to cook good food.
Thank you. - But Mom, she still
can't make fritters like you do.
l don't need to. Mom is here.
By the way, Mom, what is the plan?
Papa is all alone.
Yeah, Mom.
You need to take care of dad.
Sorry. One second.
Hello?
Hi, where are you?
l couldn't get through to your phone.
Yeah. No, l tried even earlier.
Hows your shoot going?
Gauri.
Our neighbor.
- ls everything okay?
lt's her call.
She is a very nice girl.
Yes, we both. We both. - Ever
since she has come into his life..
Excuse me.
Mom, you should stop daydreaming.
lshaan has never taken anyone
seriously, and he never will.
Shivani.
Tell him. About Anushka.
But if Anushka doesn't
want to tell him, how can l?
And look at him. He is talking
over the phone like a Romeo.
What should l tell him?
- Yes.
But to be fair to everyone,
he needs to know.
When will you tell him if not now?.
l'll pick you up later, at nine.
For sure. Don't worry.
Okay, Gauri. l need to hang up.
l'll call you back. Bye.
lshaan.
l need to tell you something.
Anushka is pregnant.
That's quick.
She didn't invite me for her wedding?
lshaan, it's your child.
And that's what she wanted to tell
you the other day, over dinner..
..but you were just so..
Oh. She has stooped so
low to have me back?
And have you lost it?
She said it's my child
and you believed her?
Oh, come on.
What's the proof that it's my child?
Yeah?
lshaan, are you out of your mind?
What are you saying?
How can you even ask me this?
Shivani..
Why are you yelling?
What's wrong?
Say something at least.
Mom, your son.. lshaan.
You know what he has done?
- l haven't done anything, Mom.
Anushka is after me.
After you?!
Mom, they were together for three years.
Okay?
Anushka tried to meet you
and papa a number of times..
..but he never let it happen.
Why, lshaan? You were having fun?
Shivani, is this the way
you talk to your brother?
What has lshu done?
Shivs.. - Mom, Anushka is pregnant.
With lshaan's child.
And he is asking me for proof.
Shivani..
lshaan cannot make such a big mistake.
Mom! Stop taking his side at least now.
How many more years will you and l..
..keep forgiving him for his mistakes?
lshaan..
ln college when you used to
party all night and come home..
Mom and l used to lie to papa
that you are sleeping upstairs.
And your report cards..
You used to get caught
forging papa's signatures..
And Mom, you used to tell
papa that you forged them. Wow!
You have always been wrong, lshaan.
And we have been worse than you.
Mom, just ignore her.
You know Shivani has a habit of
making a big issue about everything.
l wouldn't have to face this
if l would've done this earlier.
You'll have to learn to
accept your mistakes, lshu.
Why?
When we have parted ways..
When l am leading my
life well without you..
When for once my career
seems to be on a high..
Why all this? Tell me.
lf this is my child..
lf it is?
lshaan, this is your child.
Then why didn't you tell me?
l tried.
A number of times.
But you..
- Don't give me all that shit.
Why.. Why can't you hear
someone out for once, lshaan?
Why is it always about you? You..
You were never actually
involved with me or my life.
Oh. Poor Anushka.
She can do everything by herself.
What do you want to prove?
Prove?
lshaan, actually the truth is,
that l don't want you here right now.
And l am happy.
l am happy here without you.
Oh, l can see that.
You are so great.
Anushka doesn't need anyone.
Oh, wait a second. Wait a second.
You finally got Agastya, right?
Where is he? Agastya?
lshaan, stop it. He is not here.
Then why did you cry
over Shivani's shoulder?
What were you hoping?
Hope?
lshaan, l lost hope the day when..
The day when you threw
me out of the house.
Today, mom..
Mom said that l was wrong.
All these years.
Mom and Shivani..
They all are blaming me.
All..
lshaan..
You can never change.
Perhaps, that's why we are not together.
''When l became a part of your dream..''
''ls when l woke up.''
''What kind of love is this, beloved?''
''l can hold you..''
- Hi!
''But you aren't in my destiny.''
''What kind of love is this, beloved?''
lshaan..
''Without you..''
- lshaan.. Wake up.
''May l not spend a single night.''
''Close to you..'' -lshaan.
Wake up, let's go.
''l should spend all my days.''
- Come on. Please, let's go.
''May l not spend a single night.''
''Close to you..''
''l should spend all my days.''
''When l became a part of your dream..''
''ls when l woke up.''
''What kind of love is this, beloved?''
- Sorry.
''l can hold you..''
''But you aren't in my destiny.''
- lshaan, l didn't know this is how..
l'll get a chance to get so close to you.
- ''What kind of love is this, beloved?''
Sometimes l feel as if l
don't know you at all.
''When l became a part of your dream..''
''ls when l woke up.''
''What kind of love is this, beloved?''
''l can hold you..''
''But you aren't in my destiny.''
''What kind of love is this, beloved?''
Morning.
One shouldn't have
caffeine early in the morning.
But to put an end to a few nights
and for a fresh start to a new day..
..one cup of coffee is a must.
So, here you go.
By the way if you want
to talk about last night..
..then l won't refuse to hear it.
Thank you.
Anushka.
She is my ex-girlfriend.
And that child is mine.
What happend?
She wanted to marry.
And i was not ready for commitment.
She wants you back now?.
- No.
She is very happy.
She's very happy without me.
So, do you want to go back to her?
lt's not about Anushka anymore.
lt's about us.
You and me.
That's why when l came to know
about the baby from Shivani..
..l don't know why l was
so angry with Anushka.
l thought my life has gone back
to the place l've come out of.
Because of you.
And l also felt angry thinking
about why she didn't tell me.
Male ego.
Will you go to Paris with me?
Paris?
- l had applied for a course.
l received a letter yesterday.
l have to go for a year.
You know, we could start afresh.
We can stay there in a studio apartment.
l'll go for my classes and of
course you'll make breakfast.
You will drop me and you know..
You can pick me up. We can
go for long walks. Lunch!
You can try the music Scene over there.
We can settle there.
l mean only if you want to.
l cannot force you.
Love you.
Wait. What about aunt?
She'll stay here alone?
Oh, shit!
l had to arrange for a
taxi to Pune for mom.
l'll meet you later, okay?
She'll be really angry. Bye. Bye. Bye.
Oh, wow! Paris!
l agree that l've spoilt you..
But if l've done anything
right in your upbringing..
Then you, too, do what
is right, otherwise..
..it will be a difficult old age.
l'm going back to the
responsibility l've left behind in Pune.
lshu..
Son, if possible..
..try to understand
your responsibilities.
Okay?
- Okay.
lshaan has sent an invite for his event.
How sweet.
l'll be late returning from Melghat.
Will you go for it?
No.
Hi.
- Hey.
Hi. Hi.
Hey, lshaan. Congratulations, bro.
You've finally done it.
- Thanks, bro.
Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Come on, l want to grab good seats.
Dude, l'm really looking

'Then you, too, do what is right.'
'Ladies and gentlemen. The show is

Rafiq. Change in plans.
lshaan, such a big change? Right now?.
Just do it.
'We request you to please
switch off your phones now.'
Guys, there's a change in plans.
We are doing the new track.
Listen, don't worry.
- l just can't..
Please.
- Great, he's here.
lshaan..
lshaan, l haven't even
rehearsed on this song.
And you were right.
You know better about the market.
And you know yourself
and your talent better.
You and show them what a
superstar you are, Amala.
Okay?
Go.
Okay, guys. Let's go.
Let's move and no noise backstage.
Come on, all the best.

lshaan..
Paris is waiting.
Come on.
Hey, where are you guys going?
The show is about to begin.
lshaan, Anushka's
contractions have started.
She is all alone. We really should go.
Let's go.
Shivani..
Not you, l should go.
l'm sorry.

Congratulations.
She had a healthy baby girl.
Thank you.
Hi, baby girl.
l'm your papa.
l thought l should
prepare you a little about me.
Everyone says that l'm very selfish.
They are right.
Someone once told me that
l can change if l want to.
That l should never stop trying.
Today, after seeing you l feel,
that that person is right.
Today, l have got another chance.
l promise.. l will never stop trying.
l'll be good.
l promise.
l'll be better.
l promise.
l'll be the best.
For you.
One day l'll make you so
proud that you'll happily say..
''lshaan Sabharwal is my papa.''
And l love you.
Would you like to hold her?
Hi, baby.
lshaan..
Here you go.
She needs her papa.
She needs you.
After all, she has only one father.
l think it's a bit too
late to escape that now.
Thank you.
l heard that you were
going to go to Paris.
No. lt's important for me to be here.
With her.
With you.
lshaan, our time is over.
What will we gain even
if we do get married?
Fights, arguments, divorce?
Think about what she will go through.
We need to build a
world for our daughter..
..where in spite of knowing
that her parents aren't together..
..she knows that they are happy.
Where she knows that even if
our worlds are different, she..
She is our universe.
Yeah.
lf you love her..
..then don't let her go.
Hey.
Wow.
Thank you. -Thank you, sir.
Yeah, Anushka?
- Yes, lshaan. Where are you?
Anushka, l look after
her better than you do.
Yeah, yeah, l know.
Anyway, just chill.
lt's my turn, today.
- Hey, but..
Good morning, sir.- So it would be better if
you and your husband disturb me a little less.
But listen, don't be late.
Okay, bye.
- Listen..
Okay, bye.
Okay. Bye.
Hi, Diya. How are you, little one?
Diya, look who's there, baby.
Hi, lshaan.
When are you coming back?
Hey Diya, how are you?
Look..
- You know what?
lf your papa says, ''l'm the best.
l'm the best'' to you..
..you shouldn't listen to him at all.
You know why?
Because.. because you are the best.
You really are the best
thing that's happened to him.
Who's the best? Who's the best?
Diya is the best.
Who's the best? So cute. Look..
Bite your fingers?
