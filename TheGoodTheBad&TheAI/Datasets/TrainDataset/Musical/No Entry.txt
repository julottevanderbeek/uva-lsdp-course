Where are you, Kaajal?
I am here,
getting your breakfast ready.
Forget the breakfast, darling.
I am already late.
No way! Have your breakfast first!
You are too much!
Smelling good? What's the matter?
And looking very handsome too!
Where are you headed to?
- Think positive, darling!
Where else can I go except to office
that too so early in the morning?
Well, you seem to be dressed
up for a date!
Hey...
- Okay now?
I was just joking!
Why do you get so serious?
It always starts as a joke...
to develop into a series of questions
suspecting me...
making me late for office everyday!
I have so much work pending today.
Why? Don't you have work everyday?
At least listen to me, Kishan!
- What should I listen?
Why don't you schedule this
interrogation for Sundays?
I can't really help it! Every morning,
I wake up with a resolve...
...that I will not doubt you,
but it all goes kaput in a short while.
Please forgive me!
Have this toast at least.
I'll eat this toast later.
Let me hug you first.
I love you.
- Enough! Go on, now.
Hey! What are you doing?
- Watching TV.
Switch it off and attend
to your chores! Go!
Listen! What is that you are wearing?
A sari and a blouse!
- I know that!
But why all these openings behind?
- For air circulation!
Well, you see, you have ACs,
coolers, everything.
But this is the only arrangement
for me!
Really! This won't work here.
If you want to work in this house...
...keep your AC and cooler covered!
Understood? Go!
Look at that! He talks of important
work at the office and...
forgot to take the file
Kaajal!
So many times I have asked you
to refrain from...
you made me forget the file.
Hey, Lakshmi! Where is Kaajal?
Madam has gone for her bath.
Won't be out before an hour.
What's up?
You seem to be in a bad mood.
You ask me to wear such
AC-cooler blouses!
Madam says that it's not done!
To whom should I listen?
Neither to me nor to her!
Just listen to your heart, Lakshmi!
Is it a really an important file?
- No... just a namesake file!
What happened, madam?
What happened, madam?
Sir left a long time ago.
Nothing! Disperse!
Listen!
- Yes, madam.
Here's your salary.
Don't report to work from tomorrow!
What have I done?
- You haven't done anything yet, right?
But you will surely end up doing
something, someday!
I need a maid for this house and
not a heroine!
Madam, I said that I won't wear
such blouses.
Wear whatever and however you want to!
But not in this house! Ok?
Here you are! Get going!
Ok, I'm leaving! However,
I will say something.
I work in 10 houses.
And those women too have their men.
But no one thinks the way you do!
If you continue doing that, Sir will
get tired of you and find another
You too? I was just explaining
this to her.
What kind of clothes you girls wear!
Sir, is there some problem
with this dress?
Some problem? There are only problems!
It's...
It's too revealing! Don't wear
such clothes to office, please!
Your wife prompts you to say this,
isn't it, sir?
What do you mean?
Does being henpecked make me upright?
No, sir, it's the other way round.
- Shut up! Shut up!
What kind of a headline is this?
'Minister involved in sleazy sex! '
Don't you want this newspaper
to continue running?
Publishing such a news without
proper evidence will...
No, sir, we will publish it only
after we have the evidence.
It must be here any moment now.
I know Shekhar won't relent without
shutting this newspaper down.
Now this is something
Don't do such risky works!
You are not just an employee for me.
You are my friend; my younger brother.
You will land up in big trouble
some day!
Sir... I can even lay down my life to
repay the favours you have done to me.
How can I forget the day
when I simply loitered around...
in a deprived and dishevelled state?
You were the one who supported
and helped me then.
But... you never mentioned
about your family till date.
You seem to belong to
a well-to-do family.
What do you mean by 'seem to belong'?
I do belong to one.
I mean, what brings you to this city
all of a sudden and...
that too in such a state?
Sir... my father had a cap-business.
And his partner actually
capped him one day.
The land, the property, the money,
he grabbed everything.
Since nothing else was left, this cap
was his only inheritance to me.
Anyway, sir... which one among these
photos should we publish?
None of these!
Sir, I literally snatched these
photos from a dog's mouth!
Sunny! Enmity with ministers
can cost us dearly!
Already our newspaper is in the red,
do you now want it to shut shop?
Nothing of the sort will happen, sir.
This would rather double up our sales!
Women are in constant lookout for
a proof of their husband's affairs...
...to enable them to put collars
around their necks!
We will provide them
with the proof, sir.
And after that... every morning...
women will make do without...
the vegetables but
not without our newspaper...
...constantly anticipating their
husband's photograph in it
Yes, Sunny! This will help half
the population of husbands...
...secure divorce and the rest will
mend their ways on their own.
But, what will be the fate of
our newspaper after that?
It will continue to sell,
even after that.
Every husband in the world can
mend his ways...
but not your friend Prem!
- Yes!
We will click his pictures! He couldn't
reform in his previous birth...
not at all in this birth and will
never in his next birth even.
"Just love me!"
"Am I alone?"
"Surrounded by pretty young things!"
"Just love me!"
"Am I alone?"
"Surrounded by pretty young things!"
"The story of life is momentary."
"The magic of youth, once
lost is gone forever."
"All you pretty ones!"
"Come, let me embrace and
love you all."
"Tomorrow is so unpredictable,
sweetheart!"
"Just love me!"
"I am known to be an admirer of
beauty by one and all."
"Every girl gets bowled over
by my charisma!"
"I live for fun and frolic!!"
"Wild, wicked and wayward!"
"What's wrong with being one?"
"Just love me!"
What! What are you saying, Prem?
You're already back and
I don't even know of it!
Ok, but for your work in office you'd
have come home to surprise me, isn't it?
I can understand that you are
loaded with work.
Just a minute... what is it?
Isn't the freedom you have given to
Prem on the higher side?
It's not good to trust
someone so blindly!
Sister, leave my husband alone,
at least.
You are so naive, Pooja!
You don't know how these men are...
I know my Prem very well. Great virtues
earned in my previous birth.
...have got me a husband like him.
Look, come home early today. Bye.
- Bye, sweetheart!
Why did you call your wife if you
don't even intend to go home?
One should always be sure
about his wife.
What if she spots me being
so close to you?
Hi, brother! What a timely entry!
Take some more snaps.
Say how about this? C'mon,
go ahead. Go ahead... click it.
Didn't you like the pose?
Here is another one!
Click, man! Don't waste time.
Very good! This one too!
When will I get the photographs?
- In the evening.
But not you, your wife will get them.
Why? Why my wife?
- Well... he wants it that way.
Hey! You are my friend!
The photos are mine!
And you will give them to my wife!
What kind of a friend are you?
A true friend! And I can do anything
to bring him on the right path.
Kishan... I can't really understand.
Am I treading the wrong path?
Aren't you?
You have such a good and trusting wife.
And here you are with another girl!
Isn't this wrong?
What's wrong with it!
Didn't you have a 'Maruti 800' before?
So what?
- You bought a 'Zen' after that.
Then, an 'Opel' and a 'Lancer'.
And you own a 'Mercedes Benz'
today, pal!
I do. But what do you want to say?
All that I want to ask is the reason
why you changed so many cars?
Well, driving the same car
can be so boring.
And one needs to change an old car,
isn't it?
Right! And the wife?
You changed 7 cars in the last 7 years!
But you still have the same wife!
Are you crazy? Does one change his wife
like he changes his car?
Hey, you're right! We are upright guys
and that's why we don't change wives.
But is it some sin to board
another car for a while?
Pooja will answer this question for
you when she gets these pictures!
Officer! Please come here.
Please inform them about the gravity
of the crime of clicking pictures...
...in such a high-security area.
- What are you doing?
Sir, we were just clicking
our friend's pictures.
Just for fun, sir!
- Are they your friends?
They are. But I cannot vouch
for any of them.
I don't want to get into any trouble
if a plane gets hijacked.
Come with me.
- No, officer, just have a look.
There is no roll in it.
We were just joking.
There is no roll? You were joking!
- Yes, we were joking.
It is fine then. In that case,
I can vouch for them. Thank you.
I knew it, brother that...
you can never click such
objectionable pictures of mine.
One day, I will not only do it, Prem,
I will also publish them...
...on the front-page of my newspaper!
Just like P. K. Gupta!
What is this?
What is this?
- It's a photograph.
Whose is it?
- Mine.
It's yours! And who is with you?
She is a girl.
- A girl! What is she to you?
No one.
- No one?
Then what are you doing with her?
What am I doing? Just dancing!
Only in the picture not in reality!
I am your wife and am not
'the public' to be fooled so easily!
Honestly, this is a conspiracy of
the opposition to defame me.
Listen carefully! I will kill you
and myself become a widow...
if ever I see you dancing in a
photograph even.
That journalist really messed up
P. K. Gupta's life.
This suicide case is going to kill me.
I haven't written a single line
in the past half an hour...
and this news needs to go in
tomorrow's newspaper.
Did he throw it for you?
I wish it is for me.
C'mon, read it fast.
Let's see what's written.
I can't live without you.
Wherever you are,
I want to be there with you.
I am leaving this world for you.
Everything will be done.
Have this tea first.
He's contemplating suicide.
He's so cute.
Losing in love makes a person
so lifeless!
Even the tea tastes bitter to him.
Add some sugar, at least.
- Yeah, sure.
Sanjana, such a handsome guy and
he wants to commit suicide?
And that too for his dead girl-friend.
We should save him.
Hey, where has he disappeared?
C'mon, girls.
Hey mister, where's your friend?
- At the suicide point.
Suicide point and you didn't even
bother to stop him?
Well he's my friend and he's doing
a good job. Why should I stop him?
You are his friend?
You should be ashamed of yourself...
stupid. C'mon girls, follow me.
Wow! What a place!
How can people commit
suicide from here?
'Champa, because I couldn't
embrace you... '
'I am embracing death! Your Champak! '
How stupid!
What must he have said before dying?
He must have definitely taken his
girl-friend's name.
Champa...!!!
I am coming!!!
It's his bike.
- Sanjana, he's there.
Champa...!!!
Hey, stop.
- Wait...
Hey stop... wait, what...
No, wait... stop what are you doing?
What are you trying to do?
Hello, scoot from here.
- Scoot, but why?
Who are you?
- That doesn't matter.
I won't let you do what you have
come here for.
Why won't you let me?
Do you own this Suicide Point?
This is a public property and
I'll do as I wish.
So you won't relent?
- No!
C'mon, get hold of him.
Help... help...
Pull me up...
How will we pull him up,
we are not equipped.
Hey, what are you doing?
I can't let a cute guy die like this.
That's why I am taking off my skirt...
you also take off you pants.
You take off yours too. We'll turn it
into a makeshift rope and pull him up.
My hands are slipping.
Pull me out of here.
Hey, he's slipping. C'mon, be quick.
Seems, they've gone from here.
Is someone else there?
I am not here.
Pull me up.
Hold it and come up.
Pull him up...
'Get out of here, Sunny! They've
got another weapon to kill you.'
That's a nice style of expressing
gratitude!
Hey, he's going.
Fast, note down his bike number.
- But why?
We'll inform his family that...
he wants to commit suicide.
Then it's upto him and his family.
I'll tell you about your past
and your future...
I'll tell you everything.
I'll make predictions about your
destiny, you handsome couple.
Let's ask him,
when will we have our kid?
Kaajal, the world has reached the moon
and you want to ask this parrot?
Okay, we'll ask him. Come...
Come and get your predictions,
handsome couple.
Tell me first, which parrot is going
to make the predictions?
The parrot will point the card and
I'll make the predictions.
Raja, tell me the number of this
gentleman.
Number two.
- Number two! Aha!
Brother, you are so fortunate.
You are twice blessed.
You've two houses?
- Yes!
You've two offices?
- Yes!
You've got two cars?
- Of course!
And two wives?
- 100%
What?
Hey, what crap are you talking?
It's not crap. I am just reading
what's written here.
Now, I know why
you were making excuses?
Please tell us some more.
He's got a child from
his second marriage.
Child?
- Hey!
Kaajal, don't cry.
I don't have any child.
Kaajal, he's...
- Daddy...
Daddy...
- He's not my kid, Kaajal!
I swear on you,
I don't even know him, Kaajal.
Then why is he coming
running towards you?
Daddy... daddy, I want a balloon.
You want a balloon, come we'll
buy it for you.
Mister, keep you child in control,
he almost got me killed.
Spoilt my entire mood!
Did you see that, Kaajal...
he's not my...
The kid may not be yours
but you do have a second wife.
Kaajal, listen to me...
- I know you very well.
Listen to me, Kaajal! He's a fraud.
Kaajal, why are you crying?
- What to say?
Today being a Sunday I thought to
take Kaajal out...
...but that astrologer...
Hey, why don't we ask him, let us get
your predictions from him?
Then we will come to know whether
he's genuine or a fraud.
Of course, why not?
Come, let's try our luck.
Just wait and see! The reality
will be out any moment.
Raja, tell me this generous
gentleman's card number.
Number One.
- Number one? Aha!
His heart complies with his
innocent face!
What makes you take birth in this
dark age?
You are really fortunate, sister,
that you've got...
...a saint for a husband in these
wretched times.
And my prediction is that this
man has never...
...laid his eyes on another woman
and will never do it.
He's taken you as his wife for all
your future births.
You are really blessed!
Did you hear that? Did you?
Kaajal...
Kaajal... Pooja...
Don't cry, Kaajal.
Whatever, you had to speak about
me you did it for him...
Your parrot, I'll...
Not the parrot but the money speaks,
my friend...
Money...!?
Come here...
I have been trying hard to make
you understand but in vain.
What is the most important thing
that God has given us?
Brains. And why?
To use it to our advantage... to lie...
To have a few girlfriends on the sly.
Few? I don't have even one and yet
she has tried to commit suicide twice.
If I did have one then...
- Nothing will happen.
I'll explain you the logic.
A man is a very sensitive creature...
...and that's why whenever
he has an extra-marital affair...
...he feels guilty and showers
his wife with love...
...making the wife think that
her husband loves her a lot.
And when he doesn't have an affair,
he comes home, exhausted.
Quietly he slips into his pyjamas,
eats his dinner,
watches television, fights
and goes off to sleep.
And that's when a wife
starts suspecting that...
her husband is having an affair.
Why are you thinking so much?
Do as I say and you will find Kaajal
happy just as Pooja is.
And that's my guarantee!
I have just given you the idea and see
the result are evident.
That's nice.
- Isn't it? Then it's fun from now on.
What is going on, Kaajal!
Wipe your tears.
I can't see you like this.
Okay, fine...
everything will be alright.
Tonight, I am taking him for dinner
with me. So he'll be late.
Why should I worry
when you are around?
But make him understand.
Teach him something.
Make him just like you, Prem!
- Did you hear that?
Be ready tonight.
- Where are you taking me?
Just come along.
"Hi gorgeous!"
"A few lost their fortunes!"
"A few their beats!"
"Yet others lost their lives!"
"While the rest lost
their whole worlds!"
"A few lost their fortunes and beats!"
"Yet other lost their lives and
their worlds!
"The whole of country was robbed!"
"The lane of love has a - No Entry!"
"They all get my charms..."
"those who come across me"
"They go crazy..."
"dreaming about me"
"My eyes are intoxicating,
my nuances, sensuous"
"Anyone who sees me,
falls for me"
"The lane of love has a - No Entry!"
"My sweetheart, O' my sweetie pie!"
"Just listen to me, buttercups!"
"Let's enjoy this spring of love!"
"Let's trap the whole country!"
"The lane of love should now have a
- Yes Entry!"
"Getting love-struck is said
to be essential, my love!"
"All stories are incomplete
without love, sweetheart!"
"Meeting on the sly and exchanging
sweet-nothings..."
"...is something everyone should
try at least once!"
"The lane of love should now have a
- Yes Entry!"
How come you are boozing tonight?
My wife is at his house and so I have
a chance to get knocked out, today.
Kishan! This is Bobby.
This is a club and not a temple.
Here, you meet like this.
Kishan! Don't let her go.
Prem, ask her to let go of me.
- No...
Didn't you like it?
I like the perfume...
- What? Bobby...
You liked only the perfume?
Prem, Kaajal must be waiting for me.
Allow me to go now.
Nice meeting you. Bye!
Don't look at him, he's a married man.
He loves his wife very much!
- Is that so?
I'll pay you two hundred thousand
if you can to corrupt him.
Two hundred thousand? Bet?
- Yes!
Consider yourself having lost it!
Bobby, come here.
- Coming.
Hey wait...
Okay, bye...
Prem...
Prem, what kind of a trap are
you setting that poor guy in?
He's not a poor guy. He clicks
my objectionable photographs!
Just let me get something against him
and I won't spare him.
You know, what the ladies were saying?
- What?
They were saying, that we have been
celebrating 'Janmashtmi'
...for so many years now. Very soon we
will be blessed with a child like him.
Be positive! Surely and very
soon we will have one!
What fragrance is this?
Well... it's a perfume...
- Even I know that?
But this is some new one...
not the regular one.
Very true... One of Prem's
friends had put it on me.
He has a perfume store.
I resisted a lot but he had his way.
So, what's the problem?
- Problem?
It's a nice one. You should use it.
- Is that so?
I'll bring some sweets for you.
What is this, Lord? Everyday,
my truths get me a solid bashing.
And my first lie in life earns
me sweets!?
It's not difficult to fool the wives.
Should I step in the 'No Entry' zone,
just like Prem?
No, no... it's not good
to deceive one's wife.
But I surely liked what happened today.
What did you like?
- Everything?
Isn't Pooja at home?
She's gone home...
- What?
She asked me to go to her
place tomorrow...
from where we will go to visit the
temple.
Prem won't be spared today. He will
reach home drunk to find Pooja there!
Let me relish the sweets on this!
You had a drink?
Don't ask my whether I had it.
Ask me why I had it.
Why?
That's because one of our employees
tried molesting a female staff member.
He misbehaved with her.
When I asked him the reason of his
behaviour...
he said that she appeared to be his
wife to him in his inebriated state.
So, I gave him a tight slap.
Sobbing, he started saying that since
I am a gentleman...
who has never had a drink,
I would never come to know...
...that every woman appears to
be one's wife, when one is drunk.
So, I immediately bought one
bottle and drank it all.
You drank one whole bottle?
Just because he had a full bottle,
I did the same.
Then?
Then I asked the staff girls
to stand in a line.
And then I recognised them
by their respective names.
None of them appeared me to be
my wife among them.
So, I called him and said that when
I couldn't see my wife in them...
how could he?
He kept quiet and others were stunned.
I thrashed him,
caught him by his hair...
and said, 'You are maligning the
spirit of liquor.'
'Have you ever treated
your mother or...
sister as you wife in
an inebriated state?
I pushed him and
sacked him then and there.
Did I do something wrong?
You've never wronged anyone.
I know... I know,
your husband is very strong.
O Lord! Make Pooja my wife
in all my births!
Hey! Prem, you seem to be very
happy today.
Whenever my scoundrel friends land
in a soup, it gives me great joy.
Which friend of yours has landed
in a soup, pal?
Not already landed but
Kishan is about to!
I have sent Bobby after him.
But, he's an upright guy.
No matter how upright
a person may be...
seeing a bombshell like Bobby
is sure to make him falter.
Very true!
Bobby has taken him out shopping.
- You are a first rate scoundrel.
What are you scared for? I'm not
going to fleece you like your wife.
I'm tired.
- Oh come on! Let's check out there.
May I buy a necklace?
How's this?
- Nice.
Put it on me.
What's wrong, sis?
- I think I saw Kishan with some girl.
You go a bit overboard with this
habit of suspecting him.
You always feel that he is with
some or the other girl.
It's not an imagination.
I actually saw him.
Hello! Sunrise Publications!
Sunny, it's me.
Me? Who?
- It's me! Kishan!
Sir, your voice sounds so different.
Sunny, transfer my cabin phone
to my mobile.
Why do you worry, sir?
I'm here to take messages for you.
And I will finish you off! Transfer
the line immediately or else...
I will get you transferred.
- Okay, sir.
What are you doing?
- I'm calling up at his office.
Office?
Where are you, Kishan?
In Paris. About to jump down
from the Eiffel Tower.
Why do you say so?
- What else should I do?
Where have you called up?
At the office, isn't it?
Where else would I be other
than the office?
Hey! Sunny, just get my files please.
Tell me what is it? I've a lot of work.
- Nothing.
I just called up as I was missing you.
You are unnecessarily getting upset.
Where is he?
- In office.
What happened?
Why are you so scared?
Where the heck have you brought me?
My wife is here.
I was wondering what made you vanish.
- Rather, I am going to vanish now.
If she spots me with you,
this shopping centre...
is going to vanish just like the WTC.
Sorry. Bye.
- Hey!
God knows when I'll get a chance
to earn 200,000!
What happened?
It's his car.
- Yes, it's Kishan's car.
But why is it here?
- That means he lied to me.
I'm doomed. O Bhagwan , save me!
Did you call me? What's it?
You?
- Yes. My name is Bhagwan.
You called me, didn't you?
What is it?
No, not you.
I was remembering the Almighty!
Ok. It's fine then.
Yes, Kaajal.
- Are you still in the office, Kishan?
Come here and see for yourself.
- No. I just need your car.
It's parked outside the City Centre.
- Why?
I went there for shopping, love.
The car broke down. And the
driver is on his way there.
Tell me where to send him.
- I too had come to the City Centre.
Spotted your car,
so just enquired about it.
You suspect me so much.
What would Pooja think?
No, I am not suspecting...
How do you know Pooja is with me?
- You are so naive.
Have you ever been out for shopping
alone? I just made a guess.
I will hang up now.
- Kiss me first.
I'm disconnecting the line. Bye.
- Bye.
O' God!
My landlady threw my belongings
out of the house.
She threw me out of the house.
That crazy female spread
the word that...
I am committing suicide for
some girl named Champa.
Who is this Champa?
Laugh as much as you want.
But tell me where I will stay now.
She has rendered me homeless.
Don't worry. Stay there.
There? Outside?
- Not outside. Come here.
In my guesthouse.
It's locked since many years.
Here are the keys.
Is this house mine?
- Just to live in it.
Your favours are piling up on me.
How can I ever repay them?
Don't worry about that, Sunny.
I will take it back with interest,
as and when needed.
I am ready to lay my life for you,
brother! Kill me if I object.
Do that later. Get that house cleaned
first. It is infested with mice.
I'll take care of the mice, sister.
But I dread that pest of a girl.
See, I am already hiccupping.
She is definitely plotting
something for me.
Sanjana, look there. Champa's lover.
I think he has changed his mind.
No, in order to deceive others,
such people act happy.
But they continue to suffer from
within. C'mon girls, let's go.
Yes please?
- Do you have rat-poison?
Here's your rat-poison.
- Thank you!
Give me Dettol as well.
- Dettol Soap too?!
Dettol? Even in soap he's
searching for death.
Can't he buy a 'Lifebuoy'?
But why is he buying a rope?
To kill himself with the rope
if the rat-poison deceives him.
Thank you. Do keep coming.
Peep in from there.
Try to see what he's doing here?
Hey, he's climbing on the chair.
He's hanging the rope. O' my God!
- What happened?
He's preparing to kill himself.
- Preparing to kill himself?
Hey, open the door...
- Open the door.
What should we do now?
Go and call the neighbours.
Shout! He's trying to kill himself.
Wait. Stop! Open the door!
What are you doing?
- What are you trying to do?
Who are you all?
- We are your neighbours.
Why have you barged inside my house?
- Tell me what is bothering you?
I am like a mother to you.
Life is an invaluable gift of God.
Don't waste it like this.
Trust my experience. Those who commit
suicide repent it bitterly after death.
Yes, son. Look at me, I still want
to live for another 75 years.
And you've given up to the challenges
of life at such a young age?
Face them bravely.
- Yes, face them bravely.
She's the one who told you everything,
didn't she?
Yes, this innocent girl
saved your life.
What do you want, after all?
I just want to know whether you are
still to consume the rat-poison...
or have you already done it?
Listen, you'll have
to promise me that...
you will never contemplate
suicide henceforth
No, I'll never think about it.
But, I want to kill someone.
- Murder?
What weapon should I use?
- Those doe-horns behind you...
anyone would die if
you shove it in him.
But whom do you want to kill?
- You!
Wait... where are you running to?
I'll kill you and go to jail!
Stop there!
I'm not sparing you.
I've caught you...
where will you escape now?
Have you gone crazy?
- No!
I have rather come to
my senses now.
You have maligned me in front
of the whole world.
Wherever I go,
people start pitying me.
They say that I am the poor guy
who wants to commit suicide.
And people will keep visiting me
just to check whether...
I am dead or still alive.
I want the world to help me
keeping a tab on you.
I am just wishing good for you.
Speak up, will you wish well for
me ever again?
Till my last breath.
Why?
Why?
Because in today's world, the moment a
person's girlfriend is dead...
he is in another girl's arms
in no time.
And here you are...
who wants to give up his
life for Champa's love?
Champa... Champa...
Just see you get so deeply affected
by the mere mention of her name.
Where does one find such
a beloved these days?
Tell me, won't someone fall
in love with...
a person who believes so much in love?
I love you.
"In love!"
"In love!"
"In love!"
"What has this love done to me?"
"Something seems to be impending..."
"...something has already happened!"
"My love, you are the goal of
my lovelorn heart."
"It doesn't rest in peace without you."
"I have fallen in love with love!"
"My love, you are the goal of
my lovelorn heart."
"In love!"
"These fragrant meetings filled
with nervous emotions."
"Something about you makes
me forget everything."
"This yearning of my loneliness,
scattered all over my rocking dreams..."
"...has kept me engrossed since dusk."
"Such a captivating tale of yours..."
"...makes my heart crave for you!"
"What has this love done to me?"
"Something seems to be impending..."
"...something has already happened!"
"My love, you are the goal of
my lovelorn heart."
"In love!"
What has happened to you today,
Kaajal?
There's this strange
warmth in your love.
You? What are you doing here?
I saw your wife going out.
I thought, I shouldn't loose
this opportunity.
So I came in.
Try jumping in the sea of love once.
One dip in it will never
let you want to come out.
Why are you so much after me?
Even I don't know that.
But I find you very alluring.
Finding you before me makes my heart...
...skip a beat.
Listen, if my wife happens
to come here...
not only are you going to get killed
for sure, she will also kill me.
Such a henpecked man?
Not henpecked. I love her a lot.
- So who's stopping you?
Spend 23 hours with her and
allot me only one hour.
I am head-over-heels in love with you.
She might be back any moment now.
You are being so inhospitable.
Ask for a glass of water, at least.
- Right away.
Here, take this...
What happened?
- Nothing.
For whom is this cold drink?
What do you mean by 'for whom? '
It's for you, sweetheart!
You were out in the sun.
- One doesn't feel the sun in an AC car.
What has happened to, you?
I smell something fishy here.
Fishy? But we have no fish in
the house. How can you smell it?
Wow! What a beautiful dress!
You look so pretty and inviting.
I feel like loving you!
Kishan, what's gone wrong
with you all of a sudden?
Nothing has gone wrong!
It's all intentional.
I really love you... I really
love you, Kaajal.
He is so tensed and here you are,
laughing at him?
What else should I do? Shed tears?
He is one great soul
who wants to steal mangoes...
but is also scared of falling
off from the tree.
Am I interested in Bobby?
Are you asking this or
telling this to me?
None of the two.
I am just cursing my luck...
for having gone to the club with you
and getting trapped in this situation.
I would have been ruined had
Kaajal spotted me.
Is it? I will just call up Bobby
and tell her that Kishan hates her.
Forget your home she won't
step even in your lane.
Just see his face turning pale!
Actually his boring
life suits him well.
The same office, the same home
and the same wife.
Forget bothering about Kaajal
and embrace Bobby.
Do something, at least.
Applying one's mind combined
with smart lies...
will never get a man being caught
by his wife.
Sister, it becomes
very tough for me...
whenever you observe this vow of
silence.
Do you know why is she
crying so bitterly?
Only tomorrow will that be possible.
She has never broken her vow of
silence in all these 7 years.
I might as well come tomorrow.
Listen...
You broke your vow?
- I had to.
Kishan was expressing too much
love, yesterday.
That's good, isn't it?
- Not good. It creates suspicion.
Whenever the quantity of a man's
love undergoes any change...
the wife should consider
having lost him.
I will have to turn a detective
for him now.
Only then will he be
caught red-handed.
Wipe yourself dry, sir.
- Thanks.
How's my little doll?
- I'm fine.
Don't worry at all.
No one will learn about it.
Here... keep this money.
Go on... keep it. I told you that
no one will learn about it.
Just take care of my doll.
I'll leave now. Bye!
Bye, my child!
- Bye!
Kaajal! Kaajal... That... I...
- There is no need to explain!
I have seen everything myself! Since
when has all this been going on?
Kaajal, be positive.
Whatever you're thinking...
It's not that way, Kaajal!
- It is!
You are just what I had thought
you were!
Look, Kaajal, listen to me...
- Just, tell me this...
because I don't know!
What does she have that I don't?
Kaajal, you are not in your senses!
She is a married woman!
She has a child!
So you are having an affair
with a married woman!
According to you, a man and
a woman can have...
just one relationship, isn't it?
Come! Come on!
Do you recognize him?
- Ram Gopal!
Yes, it's Ram Gopal.
He was the chief editor of our
newspaper since the last 8 years.
But do you know why...
he is trying to make these
funny paintings to run his home?
Because he lost both his legs
in an accident 6 months ago!
I really tried to help him.
However, he is a proud man.
He did not agree.
Since they were unable
to pay the fees...
his innocent daughter was
thrown out of school!
These people were almost
on the streets!
Since then, I come here discreetly
to help them in some way! And you!
You have crossed all the limits
of suspicion, Kaajal!
I regret having married a woman
like you and ruining my life!
"Everyone likes my face."
"Everyone falls in love with me."
"Everyone likes my face."
Go ahead and drink! Drink, my friend!
Drink this too!
Another 4 doubles, please!
You are not at fault here.
This is the result of...
your wife's suspicion and an
award for your honesty!
There is a limit to suspicion!
A limit to suspicion!
You know, it's understood that
when a man goes out...
he puts a lock on the door.
A person checks once...
or twice but your wife...
she keeps sitting next to the lock!
You are an honest man.
If I was in your place...
I would have sneaked in from the back,
taken everything and...
I would have changed the lock too!
No Entry!
Let me tell you something.
What gives you...
all the grief in this world? A woman!
And who gives you all the
happiness in this world?
A woman! Well, if one woman has
hurt you so much...
let another woman give you
some happiness!
"Love me, honey!"
"Kiss me, honey!"
"There's no one like me!"
Listen to me.
One made you cry with grief.
This one will make
you cry with happiness!
Do you want her?
- No, my friend.
No! Are you crazy?
Just look at her!
I mean, not now.
- Not now, but you do mean...
that you want her, isn't it? Good!
- Tomorrow, Kaajal...
Kaajal is going to Ajmer tomorrow.
She's going?
I'll send her in the morning.
But where will I take her?
Why do you have the guesthouse then?
The guesthouse is made just for her!
"Just me!"
"There's no one like me!
No, no, no, no! Just me!"
Shall I leave?
- Yes, fine.
Kaajal!
I know that I'm not worthy of
your forgiveness.
Please forgive me!
- No, no. It's all right.
I've been with you since
so many years.
But I've never understood you!
I have never valued your love!
- Kaajal!
But I've realised my mistake after
last night's incident.
I've realised that you can never even
look at another woman!
Please get up.
- I promise that...
I'll never doubt you again. Never!
I would have probably never doubted
you had I given you a child!
But I don't know why
I have this fear...
that your desire of fatherhood might
compel you to desert me!
Kishan! I cannot live without my love!
I just cannot!
Look... Look, you are going to Ajmer,
isn't it?
Everything will be all right.
Be positive!
On reaching there, I'll pray not
only for my child...
but for our relationship as well.
I feel that someone has cast an evil
eye on our relationship.
Lakshmi!
- I've called her. Look Lakshmi...
Sir should have his meals on time.
I know that once I am gone, you'll
eat outside.
And one falls ill after eating outside.
And when I come back, I want to see you
just the way you are now. Ah, yes!
If his head or hand hurt, massage them.
There is nothing wrong in that.
Okay, go and work.
Oh! My bag! Look,
I have kept some clothes...
for Ram Gopal and his family.
Please give them to him... Please!
Why... why are you taking my picture?
Well, will I be able to stay
without you for 2 days?
I'll just be back.
- You mean...
you are going, isn't it?
Of course!
But one must not say that.
But it creates confusion!
- Okay.
I'll be off.
Yes, Kishan, shoot! What?
The programme is cancelled!
Put your snap too, Pooja.
Yes. What happened?
- I don't feel like cheating on her.
She loves me very much.
That's because you're getting
such a big contract...
for the first time. Look at me!
I have no fear!
I'm used to it. I'm used to it, man!
No, Prem, I don't feel right
going into a 'No Entry'!
These shortcuts are not for me,
my friend.
I'll take the main road
as I usually do.
Well, brother, one must never
let a good opportunity pass!
Isn't that right, Pooja?
- Yes, brother, he's absolutely right!
Did you hear that? And listen...
That party must be reaching
at any minute.
Oh my God!
- Why are you scared?
Meet her with full confidence!
And impress her so much...
that whenever she does business...
she does it only with you!
Hello! Prem, look...
- I'm going to South Africa today.
Look now, don't waste
my hundred thousand.
One hundred thousand!
- Yes!
But there's a guarantee that
you'll feel...
that the job was worth one million!
And I'm telling you with
full experience that...
this party is fantastic!
I'll hang up now.
Sorry, I'm a bit late.
Look... I was saying. Bobby...
Can we have this programme
some other day?
You sat down!
- I've kept 100 people waiting for you!
And you are trying to chase
me from here!
The money that Prem had given you...
I'm not asking you to return it.
What do you think?
I've come to you for the 25,000?
He told me it's a hundred thousand!
it 2,500 times for you!
Because it's not money but love
that's between us!
It's a matter of the heart!
It's a secret!
A secret!
Let the secret remain a secret!
Please... Please, go away from here.
Where is the washroom?
- Washroom? ...There.
Listen to me.
Come out fast, please.
- Fast! Fast!
Oops! I forgot my ticket at home!
Driver, take the car home.
"Why are you going having stolen
my heart?"
"What makes you trouble me like this?"
"Why are you going having stolen
my heart?"
"What makes you trouble me like this?"
"I've been waiting for you
since so long."
"Why do you refuse to come close?"
Lakshmi! Where is your master?
- He's gone to the guesthouse.
"Both of us are full of desire!"
"This distance makes us
grow impatient!"
"O' my darling!"
"Our breaths are afire!"
"Sweetheart..."
"The surroundings are weaving magic!"
"Both of us are wanton!"
"I'm casting my spell over you!"
"I've been waiting for you
since so long."
"Why do you refuse to come close?"
"Why are you going having stolen my
heart?"
"What makes you trouble me like this?"
Why did you take so long
to open the door?
I was in the bathroom...
I'm not feeling well.
That is why I couldn't hear the bell.
But what are you doing here?
- What am I doing here? Yes...
I've heard that there's going
to be an income-tax raid.
That's why I had come here to
hide the files...
in the bathroom.
- In the bathroom?
They'll be wet in there!
Don't worry!
I know what should be hidden where!
But, you're here!
- I just forgot my ticket.
Then I remembered that
you also forgot...
to give me money to make an offering.
Well! I'm also a little... forgetful!
Why are your hands trembling so much?
Well... I'm not feeling well.
I'm feeling a bit cold too!
That's strange! Where is Sunny?
- Sunny!
Sunny has gone to get my medicines.
Better move or you will
miss the flight.
C'mon, let's go.
A 'ladies' sandal?
- Is it a lady's sandal?
Can't you see?
- It is a ladies sandal.
Whose is it?
- Must be of some lady.
I know that but whose is it?
- That... That...
We'll have to ask Sunny.
I'll ask him.
You must leave, darling.
Or you'll miss the flight!
This jacket?
Jacket...?
It surely belongs to Sunny.
It's a ladies jacket.
Ladies... it can't belong
to Sunny then.
Then who could it belong to?
- That...
We'll have to ask Sunny that as well!
You doubt me, isn't it?
You are doubting me again!
Does this house belong to me? Yes,
it is.
I mean, it belongs to us. But...
but it's Sunny who stays here!
What Sunny does here...
why does he keep a ladies jacket?
How am I supposed to know that?
- I was just asking.
I did not doubt you.
- But I'm the one who is hurt!
It is my heart that is burning!
I do feel that you doubt me!
Okay, I'll leave or
I'll miss the flight.
Okay, leave.
Cockroach!
Who is she?
- She is... she is...
Yes, tell me. Or will I have to ask
Sunny about this!
Sunny! Kaajal, what I was saying...
- What were you saying?
Is she the same... Income tax file?
I had just begun trusting you, Kishan.
And as soon as I left...
You cheated on me in such a big way!
I haven't cheated on you.
- So, why don't you tell me?
Who is she? What is she doing here?
- What is this, brother? You just...
Idiot! And duffer! You're in trouble!
- In trouble?
I told you so many times not to
hide anything from Kaajal.
What have I hidden?
- What have you hidden?
Tell her the truth now at least!
She doubts me!
What do I tell her?
- What will you tell her? I'll tell her.
Kaajal, this is Bobby... Sunny's wife.
Wife! When did you get married, Sunny?
- Uh... just now.
What do you mean by 'just now'?
- I mean... just now...
About a week ago...
A week... Just a week back.
She's not wearing a 'mangalsutra'!
- How can she?
Why can't she?
Bobby... Bobby...
Bobby is Christian, you see.
- Yes.
They wear a ring.
- They wear rings, you know!
Christianity...
But why did you hide this from me?
Ask him. Tell her, brother!
Actually, Bobby's brother is
an underworld don.
He was against their love.
And they got married.
Now he's roaming around openly
with a knife!
He says that he wants to kill
his brother-in-law...
and make his sister a widow!
You've locked up such a pretty and
innocent girl since so many days!
You both fell in love and got married.
You've not committed a sin...
to get so scared! Who is her brother?
I'll talk to him!
Kaajal... why will you take the trouble?
I will... I will take care of it.
- Kishan, I...
Be positive! You must leave or you'll
miss the flight.
Ah, yes! Bye!
Call me as soon as you land!
You saved me today!
Hadn't I told you not to make a sound?
And you screamed!?
I had forbidden you even to peep
from the bathroom!
And you came right out!
- There was a cockroach in the bathroom.
Would it have eaten you?
- I got scared.
You got scared!
If my wife's suspicions had been
confirmed today, you know...
I would have ended up spending
the rest of my life...
in terror in my own house!
Why are you scared now?
She's gone, isn't it? You're saved!
Please! Please! Go from here.
What happened, Sunny?
- I had thought you were an upright man.
I am an upright man, my friend!
- Bye, handsome!
Yes! I can see it!
If you hadn't done so many favours
for me I would have printed...
such a big picture of yours
in the newspaper.
Sunny, I haven't done anything.
I really haven't done anything.
Prem is responsible for all this!
But why did you have to call her
my wife in front of Kaajal?
Should I have called her
my wife instead?
You could have called her my girlfriend.
So that, tomorrow...
I could at least say that she left me,
ran away or died!
You called her my wife!
How do I get rid of my wife now?
What if Sanjana learns about this
so-called wife?
She won't come to know, Sunny.
Whatever has happened...
has happened within these 4 walls!
Just between 4 people!
And I made her your wife. Therefore,
I'll only get the two of you divorced!
I mean, I'd like to see my look-alike.
What is his name? Sh... Sh...
Shekhar.
- Yes, Shekhar. Mr. Shekhar...
Just come here for a minute,
Sweety. Well...
Ms. Nisha, I wanted to ask you something.
Does he really...
Does he really look like me?
- Absolutely! He looks just like you.
Then it's very important to meet him.
I'll call him.
He's gone to office
Okay... how do you know that
he's gone to office?
He's lying to both his wives and
you're enjoying it!
You can stop me from lying.
How can I ask Govinda not to lie?
Why do you have to whistle
when he is lying?
You intend getting married twice!
Lying is no sin for you! Shut up!
That's why you're enjoying so much
and whistling so loudly!
Go out and fight!
- Shut up!
Go and lie! Keep doing that!
Marry twice! Whistle!
We are finished from today!
- But... have you gone crazy?
For such a small thing, you...
- Is this a small for you?
Listen to me! Sanjana... Sanjana...
I promise that from today...
I'll never enjoy such scenes!
I'll never watch such films!
Please forgive me.
On one condition!
You will have to ask my father for
my hand in marriage.
Just the hand!
I want the entire Sanjana!
Dog!
Okay... fine.
- Kaajal, ever since you're back...
from Ajmer you're just involved in this
'best couple' function!
What do I do? The responsibility
is entirely on me!
I've already found 3 couples.
However, I can't understand...
what to do about the 4th! Ah, yes!
How about our Sunny and Bobby?
They will be very good! No, no!
How can both of them come together?
Why?
Well...
- You think so much before speaking...
that unwittingly I start
doubting you!
Be positive, darling! Actually...
Actually, both had a fight.
And Bobby has gone to her
brother's place.
It's not even been 4 days since
they're married...
and Sunny has already
started fighting!
The poor girl is so nice!
- We know how nice she really is!
What?
I mean, we both know what a nice girl
she is, isn't it?
But he feels she is trouble!
He won't go!
All right! I'll call him then.
Listen! Look... He's already
very unhappy. He'll be tensed too!
I'll talk to him. I'll try...
- No trying!
Both should come for the function Or
I'll reach Bobby's place!
What?
- Yes!
Sir! Hi!
Good that you called me here.
Sunny, we hold a 'best couple'
competition every year.
This year, Kaajal has registered
yours and Bobby's name.
You and Bobby will have to pretend...
