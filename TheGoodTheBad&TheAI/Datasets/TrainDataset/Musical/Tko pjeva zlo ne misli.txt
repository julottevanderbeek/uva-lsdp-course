Dad says we're the model
of an honest Zagreb family...
... and that there should be
a book on us.
... so all can be read
in a thousand years!
I'll be right back.
- Going over to Znidaršiæ's.
- Again!
No, we'll chat on Abyssinia
story from the papers.
Fine excuse! Been a while
since you were drunk!
No, no, really!
You've no idea how tight
the situation is.
Only Abyssinians won't
give up, my dear.
They're a tough nut to crack!
Mom says our neighbors
are Babbitts, but Dad says...
... it's none
of our business.
Aunt Bajs lives one floor
below us, has a cat...
People say she provided
them for her husband.
... since Mr. Bajs goes hunting,
while Aunt Bajs has no rifle at all!
Across the courtyard
are Auntie Beta and Mr. Karlek.
He's a chimney sweeper.
So when he passes by,
we hold a button to make
our wish come true.
Those without them are relatives.
When a relative comes,
because they have
some important talks!
The old Mr. Miško says it
was better in the old days.
Aunt Mina belongs to us,
too. Doesn't live with us...
... but comes almost every day.
Dad says it's not because...
... we're beautiful people,
but because of the dinner!
You've read this book, huh?
Just reading it.
Lend it to me later?
How do you like it?
Don't know...
It's nothing much.
- A bit too big.
- It's the latest fashion...
in all magazines.
Wide brim,
and the front bent down.
You know nothing
about fashion.
Listen... if you won't wear
this one, give it to me.
Fits me perfectly!
Here you are! Ana,
Franjo's here, we can eat!
- How do you like it?
- What?
The hat.
Why did you give
that hat to Mina?
What's wrong with it?
Come now, daddy! It was
out of fashion 2 years ago.
It may be fashionable again.
She asked me, she's poor.
Poor?!
Eats here, keeps money
in the bank! I'm not blind...
Hush, she'll hear you!
- Let's eat.
- Let her hear!
I'll tell her myself, right now!
Good!
Delicious!
What's in this gravy?
It's so good.
Stop gnawing at that bone,
you'll break your teeth.
There's marrow in it,
it's very healthy.
Ana, wrap a slice of beef
for me,
for supper.
Franjo, the beef is
excellent today, right?
Don't know!
Where are the papers?
Haven't seen where you
put them.
What, papers?
Here they are!
I was reading
the installment of a novel.
Leave the last page, please.
Take everything and read,
I'll go over to Znidaršiæ's!
Wait, daddy, there's desert.
Is Franjo perhaps mad?
You know him. Got up on the wrong
side of the bed today.
SUNDAY
Morning, Auntie,
we're going on a picnic!
Stop yelling like an oaf!
I'll go over to Znidaršiæ's
while mom gets ready.
'Morning, madame!
- 'Morning! Have fun!
- Thanks!
Good morning!
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?
I'm holding on.
- Why are you yelling?
- We're going on a picnic.
So what?
- Dad, let's go!
- Right!
Give me a quick one.
It's good for my stomach.
If Baldwin says: "Enough!",
Mussolini goes with his
...tail between his legs!
- A Mussolini drink?
No!
Oh, come on!
They're all rascals,
I trust no one!
Excuse me, that's not true.
You're right about Mussolini,
but Baldwin's the man!
Franjo, where's your sense?!
I'm coming!
Put it on my tab,
got to hurry!
- Bye-bye!
- Bye, neighbor!
You arranged this stupidly!
Look who's talking!
If we're late...
...it won't be Mina's fault,
but you know whose!
Excuse me?!
You can't blame me!
Who waited for whom?
Don't make a scene!
What will people think?
They can kiss my ass!
Shame on you, such words...
O. K., I can also be silent!
My respects...
Perica, say hello to Mrs. Kos.
- What time is it?
- Don't ask me anything!
Note that I'm offended
and won't utter a word!
Wait, Perica...
It's so pretty, it's so pretty,
our green Zagorje
with its black and
smoky choo-choo train...
with its black and
smoky choo-choo train...
Take your seat, take it now,
hear the whistle blowing...
it will take you
to fair Zagreb-town!
It will take you
to fair Zagreb-town!
Childr en... let's see what
you've brought to eat.
I took nothing, thinking
you'd take too much anyway...
...and it would be pity
to throw away food.
My Lord, what's that?!
A nut loaf!
Let me taste a slice...
You know, it's delicious!
It sure is.
Only... not enough stuffing.
Don't eat if don't I ike it!
No, I said it
was delicious!
- Perica, you'll taste it? No?
- No!
Franjo, admit your wife's
a wonderful cook!
Don't eat the whole cake,
it'll be better after.
- Let me...
- No, no, it's perfect now.
Honest to God, it's terrific!
Delicious.
They have nothing here!
Mom, I'm thirsty!
You'll have a drink later.
First we'll go to church.
Perica, come with me.
I'll buy you a soda.
Starting on booze already?
Excuse me! First, I'm not
going to the church.
And one spritzer
is my own business!
Fine! Perica, let's go...
Besides, I'm not
talking to you today!
I admire you, my dear.
How can you stand him?
- It's so hot...
- I'd be offended,
wouldn't even look at him!
Look how nice it is, Mina!
Perica, stop, you'll fall!
- I won't! There's a view.
- We'll look later!
Come down this minute.
Give me your hand.
Let's go,
Aunt Mina's waiting.
Let's go to the
observation tower!
We've for gotten to bring
flowers to St. Ann.
I remembered in the church
and gave a coin instead.
I couldn't give for you,
I ran out of change...
...and a ten would be too much!
- Just a moment, madame!
What?
- Oh, Lord...
- Don't! Why?
It's already done.
Thank you very much.
I know it's impolite
to attack a lady so...
...but I hope you'll excuse...
...my Iittle intrusion.
Permit me, my name is Fulir.
Pleased to meet you. Šafranek.
It'd be an honor to know...
...where to deliver the photo.
I'm sure...
...it's going to be great.
- You think so?
Only we won't pay for it.
There was no deal!
You can't force us to pay,
for get about it!
- Mina...
- Right!
You've got me all wrong!
I'm not...
...a street-photographer,
I don't do it for money...
...but for artistic pleasure.
- Ah, so!
Take no offense, please,
I didn't know.
So many people took
pictures of me...
asking for money in advance.
But I never got the photos!
Right, Ana?
Madame, another shot, please.
Don't... why me?
- Let him, it's free!
- Look here...
No, stay as you are.
Only raise your head a bit.
Fine, stay that way!
Madam, you've got a very
photogenic face. Excuse me...
Look here...
- Where?
- Get lost!
Don't move!
Look up here...
Say cheese!
Done! My respects...
May I ask you something?
You make only one photo, or
more? I'd like...
...to have one.
Only I'm afraid...
...I was covering
my face with the fan...
This is going to be
an artistic composition.
Your head bent forward...
...sunlight on your hair,
clouds and sky in the back.
You'll be beautiful.
- Pity it's not in color.
- Think so?
- You mean it?
- I'm positive!
- Your hand, please.
- Steep stairs...
You're such a gentleman.
We should really go now.
I'm sorry...
May I take the Iiberty
of visiting you?
It was a real pleasure.
Perica, thank the gentleman
for the ice-cream.
- Thank you.
- It's nothing!
I feel dizzy!
Good-bye.
Thanks for your company.
You're welcome.
- Their singing is beautiful.
- Beautiful? Nonsense!
This modern music
is just affectation.
You need no voice for that.
To you modern is nonsense.
You know only Let's Drink
and The Battle is On.
Those are old Croatian songs.
And The Battle is On is from
our national opera Zrinski,
...if you really want to know.
- Tastes differ.
Mina, what does
photogenic mean?
- What?
- You know...
Photogenic?
Probably has something...
...to do with photos.
Ask Franjo.
What does he know...
Perica, come and eat!
- You know who he reminds me of?
- No.
- Clark Gable.
- Right!
- We saw it together!
- He was just as romantic...
Today's men are rude
as peasants!
- Oh, yes...
- Why?
I can be ever so polite.
In the office they tell me
I'm quite a gentleman.
We're talking about a man
we just met.
A Mr. Fulir.
- What... Fulir?
- Yes.
Sounds familiar! My boss's
relative is Fulir.
Maybe that's him.
Listen...
Listen, he's tall, elegant,
small mustache...
- And has green eyes.
- What green? Brown!
- Green, I saw them!
- No, brown!
And a bit longer
hair... artistic!
Shame I missed him.
I'd have someone to talk to.
Perica!
Jesus and Mary!
Have you seen that?
The kids are shameless today!
...wouldn't harm you, either!
You scoundrel!
How can you, swine?!
Such words...
Alright, I'm a swine.
Thanks a lot!
I can't joke any more!
I don't have the manners...
...of those novel fakes!
But you can tell I'm a swine...
...in front of a child!
- No, wait...
Goodbye!
Expect me when you see me!
- Where are you...
- None of your business!
It's all occupied!
It's your fault, Franjo!
You had to get plastered first!
You could have gone ahead,
I need no escort!
Let's go back!
Miss, there's a place
for you here!
- Then I'm going to take it!
- For you, miss...
She's my sister, and she's married!
Franjo! Ana! I've got a seat!
Thank you very much!
- It's full, let's go back.
- They can go to hell!
Mom, there's Mr. Fulir!
Hurry!
- Give me your hand!
- Leave me alone!
I'm not drunk!
- Don't tell me I'm drunk!
- Hurry!
Thank you...
Over here, madam!
I've only one seat,
unfortunately. Take it.
Thanks, but it's yours.
- Please sit, I'll stand.
- No, no, thank you.
- I can stand, really.
- Wait! I'll sit...
...if you won't.
My legs are hurting.
- Franjo...
- It's so hot...
Now you've lost your seat.
I'm sorry...
- This is my husband...
- My pleasure.
This is the gentleman
we told you about.
You're the one?
Thanks for the seat.
Sure, but I gave it to madam...
Perhaps you know Dr. Brlek?
- Who?
- Dragec Brlek.
- I think you're related.
- No.
No? Then it's another Fulir.
Dr. Brlek is my boss.
A pleasure...
- We're moving!
- Yes...
You'll fall in love
in a moment
and the whole world
is so divine then
your dreams
have all come true...
'cause love makes
our  lives so fine...
Madame, you've got
a beautiful voice!
Don't... I can't sing at all.
Who told you that? You sing
with such a feeling...
- Please, go on.
- No...
I beg you.
singing with the voice
of my heart
'cause love makes
our lives so fine
'cause that is what
my heart desires
you know the feeling
that's divine.
MONDAY
This morning Dad didn't go to work.
He said his head was Iike a barrel...
... about to blow!
So Mom had to tie it tightly...
They were selling slop,
double-crossing swine.
They should be hanged!
I'd give anything for
a chili pepper or a pickle.
singing with the voice
of my heart
'cause love makes
our lives so fine
'cause that is what
my heart desires
- You're rarely cheerful.
- Is it bothering you?
On the contrary, go ahead.
It's more pleasant here.
I've been thinking...
Liked that Fulir guy?
Fulir? Why?
See... I think he'd be
a good match for Mina.
- You're nuts!
- No, no...
It  really is a good idea.
Mina would agree, I'm sure.
- Well?
- You and your absurd ideas!
Why? It's true...
...she's a bit older.
But it's nothing.
We all have weak points.
TUESDAY
Bottles and old iron buying!
Bottles and old iron buying!
Bottles!
Bottles and old iron buying!
- Bottles!
- Here you are...
- Mr. Fulir is coming!
- Who?
Mr. Fulir!
Pardon, madam,
for my impertinence...
- Perhaps it's a bad time?
- No, not at all!
- On the contrary! Come on in.
- This is for you...
For me?
Take this...
Thank you, you shouldn't have.
Come into the house.
Bottles... and old iron!
- This way...
- Thank you.
Well, the shots
are very good!
I'm surprised
how photogenic you are.
- You're only flattering me!
- No, I'm serious.
- Would you like some coffee?
- Since you're so kind...
You I can't refuse.
- When will we see the photos?
- Come, behave yourself!
I apologize.
Sit down, I'll bring the coffee.
Thank you.
Right away...
- What was your name, my boy?
- Perica.
I'm sure you're going
to school.
- Which grade?
- I'll start the third now.
Really?
- Daddy's not home?
- No, he's in the office.
Know what? I'll show you
the pictures,
...then you can go out and play.
- Sure!
Wait...
Here... this is you.
- You've got a nice boy!
- Really?
Coffee'll be right away.
When is your daddy
coming home?
Sorry to keep you waiting,
I did my best.
- Help yourself.
- Thank you so much.
But first I'd like
to show you the pictures.
Perica, you can go
and play now.
Sorry...
Here you are all together.
Perica... can you draw, huh?
Sure.
Draw me a nice horse,
and I'll g ive you 2 coins.
OK!
You've got a piano!
Must be you play it.
Yes... no!
Perica is taking lessons.
But he's on vacation now.
Play something, Perica.
- Don't feel like it!
- Thanks...
...madam, no need.
Unfortunately,
here you moved...
...the picture's not sharp.
But this one's really...
Very charming...
...that you're not an actress
with such a photogenic face.
- Come on... not true!
- I'm serious!
Look at those features,
the expression...
It's wonderful...
Go someplace lighter,
you'll ruin your eyes.
Maybe you're a gifted painter...
With kids you can never tell.
- Where do I go, Mom?
- Don't know...
Try the yard,
a lot of light there.
- It's not nice to...
- It's very nice there!
He says it's nice...
Help yourself to the coffee,
it probably got cold.
Here we're at a spa,
five years ago.
- Incredible!
- Why?
What a figure! You're not
aware how good you look.
Come on, you say that
to every woman...
- ... how I adore you...
- Excuse me...
- I'm an honest woman!
- Mom!
Here, I did it!
- I drew a horse!
- Fine...
Have some more coffee. My
husband will be here soon.
Then I'll go. I wasn't
thinking of staying too long.
- I drew a horse!
- Nice... fine.
- Terrific!
- Two coins, please.
You're so impertinent!
It's not his fault...
Here... two coins for candy
for being such a good boy.
- Thanks!
- You're a real gentleman.
It's nothing, madam.
- Have you thanked him?
- Of course I have!
I almost for got!
- Pictures...
- Here you are...
- Thank you.
- I'll be...
...on my way now.
- Already?
We should talk in private.
- When can we meet?
- That is not possible.
I'm sorry...
Think about it. My motto is
fairness and discretion.
Tomorrow afternoon in the
Zrinjevac Park pavilion.
- It's im possible!
- Madame...
- It's out of the question!
- Your final word?
Yes... no!
My husband's coming!
Excuse me...
You look familiar...
That's Mr. Fulir!
I drew a horse...
...and he gave me 2 coins!
- Oh, it's you, Fulir!
- I was just asking about you.
- What brings you here?
My pictures from that picnic.
- How much are they?
- You'll only offend me.
I did it as a friend.
Then at least we'll
have a drink.
Perica, fetch a bottle
from Znidaršiæ's.
Thanks, I can't now.
I'm in a hurry.
Hey, what's one bottle?
You prefer white or red?
Perhaps Plješivica?
- If you insist...
- Perica, Plješivica!
- And mineral water...
- Got it upstairs.
Bravo, madame!
Dear Fulir, it's great
two of us have met.
Right!
Cheers!
Madame...
What do you do, if I may ask?
What do I do?
Mostly acquisitions lately.
You can earn a lot that way!
With good co nnections.
A guy who built a house...
...in a posh area with that.
- Šoštariæ!
I think you should stick to art.
- You really understand it.
- You are quite right.
But today's provincialism...
Tell me, who's interested
in art today?
- Yes, it's sad.
- It's quite different abroad.
- Ah, abroad...
- Excuse me...
Are you married?
- No, I'm single.
- Really?
A bachelor.
- Told you!
- Nonsense!
Tell you something.
Best thing for you...
...is to find a good woman,
preferably with money.
- There you have it!
- What do you know...
...what's best?
- Not everybody is so fortunate...
...to find such a charming wife.
She's not so bad.
There are worse!
- He's always like this.
- But I'm different.
I need freedom!
I'd join an expedition
to Amazonia any time!
- Really?
- Or Congo!
- You wouldn't be afraid?
- Never! This stout heart...
...could hunt beasts
bare handed!
You're always talking
rubbish drunk!
Told you thousand times
you don't understand me.
But let's not discuss it now.
Excuse me... gotta go.
You must be mad at me.
A great shame if we don't
make some more pictures.
- It's not convenient...
- Don't refuse!
- I've got to see you in private.
- No, I can't.
My husband...
Stop torturing me!
Well?
Don't know...
For just one glance
of your eyes
For just one glance
of your eyes
What a pity you haven't
become a singer.
- You're just flattering me.
- Four years I sang in a choir.
A bass!
Those were the days!
Without you, dear,
oh, my sweet
Without you, dear,
oh, my sweet,
Great!
You have a great
backup voice, Fulir!
It was better while...
...madame was leading.
In this song soprano leads,
bass is backup.
- Why?
- Because!
Listen, Fulir.
Don't you lecture me.
You know zip about singing.
Excuse me, I know a lot!
...you know zip!
You're just showing off!
- That's rubbish.
- Franjo...
- I see the wine is pretty strong.
- Wine?
It's got nothing
to do with it!
You're impossible!
Stop defending him! I'm not
a kid, I need no lessons!
I think it's time for me to go.
- No one's keeping you!
- How can you?!
It's beneath my dignity
to fight here,
but I can't stand insults!
Madame...
Good-bye!
My respects...
Be thankful I didn't break
your nose! You to teach me!
The scoundrel!
I heard it right?
Yes! Think I'm afraid?
- Stupid ass!
- You insolent dope!
You told him off good,
Mr. Franjo!
Had he just moved,
I'd have smashed him!
Neighbor...
He provoked it!
Say a word...
...and tomorrow he's dead!
Enough, go to sleep.
I'm tired.
See, I'm never tired.
I've so much energy.
I could break all this
into pieces, set it on fire...
...and say: "Give me a plane, I
volunteer as a pilot in Abyssinia!"
What plane?!
Come to your senses.
If you had my sense...
...you'd get a memorial plate
above your kitchen stove.
You're wrong if you think...
...he's smarter than me.
- He's a gentleman...
...and doesn't talk
rubbish like you!
Funny how you're defending him.
You're always defending
strangers against me.
THE MODERN SINNER
Where's my youth...
WEDNESDAY
Not with the knife!
- What's with the peas?
- Why?
They're so tough
my stomach hurts!
No wonder
after three helpings.
If I eat too much,
don't invite me!
Stop it, girls.
Listen, Mina...
Listen, I'd I ike to discuss
an idea since you're here.
- Oh? What is it?
- What do you think about Fulir?
Fulir?
What do you think about
him... as a man?
Don't start again!
You stay out of it.
I asked Mina.
Well?
Well... I don't know.
He is nice.
Why are you asking?
He mentioned something?
I doubt...
...you'll find...
...a better match.
- Enough of that nonsense!
- Why nonsense?
He can find
a wife himself!
No harm in talking, right?
- Hope you don't mind!
- I'm only saying...
...you're reckoning
without the host!
I can see I annoy you!
You made peas knowing
I don't like them!
In that case... I can go!
Calm down, Your Highness.
I can't speak
in my own house...
Girls...
Mom would scold you
for your big mouth!
No wonder you never married
...with such insolence!
- What?!
I am insolent?!
You loud mouth!
I am a loud mouth?!
- Franjo!
- Come now...
Who do you think you are?
Primping all day long!
- So what?!
- When did you dust last?
Look! This shows
how much you're worth!
Franjo!
You can't insult my wife!
She's not much,
but you can't insult her!
Thanks for the dinner!
You'll never see me again!
Hooray!
- Godspeed!
- Thanks!
I'd kill you if you were a man!
Peace at last.
She never has enough.
We won't get rid
of her that easily!
My idea wasn't bad after all.
- What idea?
- Her and Fulir.
He's not married.
It can be arranged...
- Stop babbling.
- Don't worry...
We'll find him yet.
I'm going over
to Šnidaršiæ's for a while.
Deep in the forest
leaves rustle
and flowers long
for sunlight's smile
there I know a place
full of charm
There you will watch
with glee
sunshine coming through
to you
touching your hair
with its gold
I'm sorry Mr. Fulir wasn't here.
- Why would he be?
- It just came to me.
- Will he marry Auntie Mina?
- Hush, now!
Next time don't eavesdrop.
THURSDAY
Will he come
or will he not...
- Good day, miss!
- Hello!
- Will there be pressing?
- Karlek!
- Karlek!
...I shall wait for him
We're going to the river.
- They've already made up?
- God knows!
I'll whisper sweet
words of love
Fulir! Fulir!
- There's Fulir!
- Where?
Fulir!
- He's gone!
- Let's go!
He disappeared!
No, Daddy! No!
No, Daddy!
As if he was swallowed
by earth!
- You... the shower!
- No! No!
Maybe he's mad at me.
Shame I couldn't find him.
We'd discuss that Manchuria
stuff in the news.
It's quite vague, though.
- Let's go home!
- Wait, it's still early.
- I'm bored!
- You just go ahead.
I may still find him.
It's important for Mina...
- Another one, please.
- Spritzer?
Yes, does me good.
Thank you.
- Robbery!
- Why?
You'd sleep here, too?
This isn't a hotel!
Whore!
Idiot...
Shut up!
- Good evening, miss.
- Evening, Mr. Šafranek.
- Wonderful moonlight.
- I'm watching it, too.
Oh, yes...
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Šafranek.
Couldn't find him,
but all is not lost yet.
- OId drunkard!
- We only had one bottle.
Scout's honor. Discussed about
Manchuria and the Japanese.
Honest!
But I am!
The Asians
will conquer the world!
And you had to get drunk!
I'm not drunk at all.
I can stand
on one leg forever!
Enough babbling, come to bed!
What is it?!
Don't get mad...
Shame on you,
you'll wake the child.
Dad says a caterpillar turns
to a butterfly over night.
... to see it happen.
- Like two little doves...
Drunk like a skunk!
Quiet!
FRIDAY
White sand!
White sand!
Give me your plate.
Let me...
- Want some more?
- O. K.
Here...
I was rushing so,
my heart will burst!
I'm not mad any more
over that tiny misunderstanding.
Ana, look...
How do you like my new dress?
Made it myself.
Mrs. Hundiæ just cut it.
Franjo...
What do you say?
Nice, right?
Carps? Wonderful...
Our house is always open,
but you can't lecture me...
...about the dust.
- It was nothing.
Dust comes fast.
Lemon?
Guess who I saw today.
Mr. Fulir.
And where?
He was going
into Hunter's Restaurant.
He's so nice.
A fine man.
He said...
"Miss, this dress looks
wonderful on you." Honest!
He said nothing else?
Well, he mentioned a dispute
with Franjo. What was it?
- I didn't say anything.
- You did! He's sensitive...
...and you keep stinging him.
- You shouldn't have.
It's embarrassing.
He's got to stop correcting me.
Otherwise we're pals.
You can't be right always.
He's clever and knows a lot.
- And I'm stupid?
- God forbid!
It only turned out
unpleasant. Pity...
There's a fair in
Maksimir Park on Sunday.
- You're going?
- What, alone?
Perhaps Mr. Fulir
will come after all.
He won't, he's got pride!
Shame... it would be nice
if he came, right?
Again you're not eating
What's that?
- Nothing!
- Give it here!
God! What will you
bring next!?!
Go wash your hands, quickly!
- So you saw him at Hunter's?
- Right!
- What?
- Nothing...
I'll drink to that!
Cheers!
Two more spritzers!
- More soda water for me.
- Excuse me?
More soda water
for the gentleman!
You deaf oaf!
Well, while we're at it...
...I've got something to tell you.
You know my wife, right?
The Lady is very nice.
A fine woman.
I'm glad you like her.
But you know...
...Mina is also a fine woman.
- Who?
Mina, her sister.
You two have met.
I've had the honor.
- Listen, she's quite wealthy.
- You don't say.
Just between us...
Know how much she's got?
Really?
She sold her house and land.
Thank God!
She'll marry easily.
Right!
Cheers!
Watch your head.
You did come!
We made up for the insults,
at Šn idaršiæ's...
...so we don't have to
bother you about it. Right?
Of course!
Perhaps madame has some
peppers? They'd do me good.
Naturally!
I'll be right back.
- See if you have some food.
- I'm not here to eat.
Madame, many thanks.
Perica...
- Hello!
- Hi! Kitty-kitty...
Madame, many thanks.
It was wonderful.
Delicious!
It's a shame you came late,
it was completely cold.
Really, the carps dish was...
I agree, the fish
was delicious!
We have the same taste!
Carps have to swim,
and you're not drinking!
Miss...
Cheers!
Come on, Fulir,
aren't we going to sing?
I regret I can't today.
I have a sore throat.
...madame would sing.
By request, I'll gladly
sing instead of you.
But I don't know what...
- Ana, "Thank You".
- All right then.
It was so beautiful.
- Right?
- If only...
...you wouldn't sing.
You're tone deaf!
Don't be so rude!
How's your throat,
hurts a lot?
To your health!
I hope you can drink!
- Look...
- What's that?
- A saber.
- You have a saber?
Our fathers used them
against Turks!
I remember!
- Where are those times?
- Franjo...
You're really a nice guy!
- Honesty shows in your eyes.
- Wonderfully said!
I'm honest,
but stand no insults.
Can be meek as a lamb...
...but mad as a lion!
Then I can tear a man apart!
Franjo, don't!
Be a lion in your office.
Can't even ask for a raise...
You understand nothing.
Dad, give it to me!
Dear Fulir, the days
of knights are gone.
I always  tegret
I didn't live back then.
Want some peace? Raise
the drawbridge and kiss my ass!
How can you say that?!
Modern life requires
different architecture.
Instead of towers,
concrete skyscrapers.
Houses look like boxes!
I wasn't born
to live in a box!
But it's nice to live
in a skyscraper.
Lots of air and sun,
wonderful view.
I used to live
on the 17th floor...
...of a hotel in Milan.
- That high?!
You've no idea how it is.
Quit talking, let's drink!
Cheers!
Darned drinks! It's not
everything in life.
One glass of wine
is not a crime!
You're such a killjoy.
Stop sighing, carp
isn't that indigestible.
- It's not from food!
- The man's got feelings.
I do, too, but I'm not sighing.
I'm made from iron!
Perica, bring another bottle.
Life is so sad...
A man could hang himself
if it weren't for ideals...
...shining before him
like the sun.
It's hard for people
who live lonely.
It's rather strange you stil...
...haven't got married.
Oh, don't ask...
One rarely meets a woman
he could adore.
...worth falling in love with.
Only they're modest...
...and hard to notice.
I'm sure you'll find
Miss Right.
Yes...
Yes, but rare are those
of true beauty and sublimity.
I think so, too!
Most important is what's inside!
...for heart and soul, only...
You could sing one in low voice.
No offense,
but I have to leave you.
- Why?
- Out of the question!
The fun's just started!
Sorry, I don't feel well.
I'm afraid I'm... feverish.
Really?
It can be helped.
My wife can make some tea.
- Gladly!
- No, no! Thank you kindly.
But I can't stay.
- Good-bye.
- I'll see you out.
Fulir, when will we
see you again?
Perhaps at that fair?
Thanks for re inding me. Come
with us to the fair on Sunday.
- I invite you.
- Mr. Fulir...
- We'd really like you to come.
- Gladly, if I get well.
Good-bye.
Come to the fair, please!
It's getting along fine.
Did you see his glances?
You really think something
could come out of it?
What? It's in the bag!
Only you should be more
active, too.
But how?
Do something,
you're a woman...
Madame...
Since I met you,
I've had no peace.
I was thinking of you
all night last night.
At least someone...
This is no life for you.
You're a sophisticated soul.
You do understand me.
I suffer so much...
Perhaps you were
thinking of me?
I have to go inside.
- When will I see you?
- I can't tell you now.
But you'll come again?
Certainly.
For you I'd do anything!
Good night.
Dream something nice.
You too.
Good night.
Good night.
- Good night, neighbor!
- Good night!
What's with that Fulir man?
I guess he can't drink.
Perhaps the wine was
too cold for him?
He could have said so.
He's emotional, and such
people are sensitive.
Emotional! And I'm an ox?!
Don't get upset.
Lie down and sleep.
'cause that is what
my heart desires...
I was just thinking
about Mina...
If she could only
find a husband.
A woman can't live
on her own.
You know... tonight they seemed
to start throwing glances.
Who did?
More of your nonsense!
Say what you like,
but I think it'll work.
You weren't Greta Garbo
when I married you either.
A man needs a home and
comfort, so he marries.
And Mina's got money...
Not everybody is
interested in money.
You're so wrong.
Such people don't exist.
Such is life...
SATURDAY
'cause love makes
our lives so fine
'cause that is what
my heart desires...
This morning Mom was merry,
singing all the time...
... so I was able to play
with Dad's saber.
Charge!
Charge!
You dumb oaf!
Charge!
Death to janissaries!
Lend me a dress
for tomorrow's fair.
- Will you?
- Don't touch!
- Don't know what to wear myself.
- This one isn't bad.
I was just going
to try it out myself.
This one's not good?
My new one's not suitable...
...and the others are old.
...you go out, and have
nothing to wear.
- What do you think?
- What?
I don't know... this one
was better.
Think so?
I guess the neckline's too low.
The yellow one
goes well with your face.
SUNDAY
Now I know who you
remind me of.
Saw a picture of a tennis
player in papers...
You remind me of him.
I used to play tennis a lot.
Here...
I may have a picture
with me...
What a fine sport.
Everybody in white...
Like cooks! You just
stay in the kitchen!
Beautiful music...
Dad, it's from "Zrinski"?
Probably some other opera.
Jacques Offenbach's
"Hoffmann's Stories".
- Hoffmans Erzählungen.
- You know everything!
Rubbish, no one
can know everything!
Don't get upset.
You're hypertonic,
yet you had four steaks!
See the result?
I upset?
Who's upset?
I just said
no one can know everything...
- ... whoever they may be.
- I'm not showing off.
I've read a lot of books
and I do know a lot.
Must be wonderful to be so
sophisticated and educated.
- You can talk about everything.
- I read a book...
...on man's evolution.
First there were fish...
...then they got legs.
Then there was man.
Not that Englishman's book...
...about us being apes first?
- Can't remember the writer...
...but it had a nice cover.
I heard it that way.
If he was an ape, O. K.
I certainly wasn't!
- Right, Mr. Fulir?
- Certainly.
We share the same opinion
about everything!
You know zip about science!
No point in talking to you.
Excuse me... gotta go...
- Again!
- Yes, again. Thank God!
Ah, a waltz...
No, it's a tango.
It's a shame I can't dance.
I hope madame can.
But of course!
May I ask?
If you won't eat this,
I will. Shame to waste it.
I'll whisper sweet
words of love
I can't bear to be
without you any longer.
When shall we meet
in private?
Perica wouldn't eat, so I did.
Shame to waste it.
Right, honey?
You and Franjo would be
a perfect couple: You eat...
...he drinks.
You'd get along just fine!
Enough of your
criticism about food!
- I'm scared to eat!
- Calm down, will you?
It was just an expression.
I know why you do this!
What do you know?
Let's hear!
I know what I know!
Thank God I hate to quarrel!
Rubbish!
Pretty women should never
quarrel.
They're here
to embellish life.
You're a true gentleman.
My pleasure.
What wonderful weather.
Right?
It sure is... wonderful.
mine, mine!
You are, Milka, mine, mine
What?!
- Your pants...
- What about them?
So what? The keeper's in!
Happens sometimes...
You and your stupid jokes!
Fulir, you're quite
a nice man.
Let's become
bosom brothers!
- Where's your glass?
- Not too much.
Come on... get up!
Give me your hand...
Bottoms up!
One... two...
Now let's kiss.
Silence! Silence!
Our dear friend Fulir.
- Our dear Ernest!
- To your health!
Mina, you'll get drunk.
That very first moment...
...the two of us met...
...I felt right then in my
chest my heart whispering...
"That's our guy..."
Right!
"The guy we can...
... since we tend
toward mutual ideals!"
Why are you so sour today?
Bravo, Franjo!
Wonderful speech.
- Bravo!
- Wait...
I'm not done yet.
It's my pleasure to say
on behalf of us all...
Go ahead.
Our dear Ernest, welcome!
- Cheers!
- Not yet!
I'm also glad to welcome you...
to our family. Cheers!
- Cheers! Cheers!
- Now you can drink!
Wonderful speech.
You should be the Mayor!
Miss... madame...
We shall not perish
with such people.
This should go to the papers!
Perica, go and play.
We have to discuss something.
Well, Fulir... pardon...
...Ernest...
It's OK.
Let's talk openly.
I'd like to know...
...your real intentions.
What intentions?
Don't play dumb,
I have a good nose.
I see something is
cooking here. Well?
What is it all about?
I'd say you're a bit tipsy.
- I think so, too.
- I'm not talking to you!
And it's serious business.
Right, Ernest?
We understand each other.
What are your intentions
regarding our Mina?
What are you talking about?
He's just kidding!
Your rubbish again!
Excuse me,
I don't quite understand.
What an actor!
Almost fooled me...
- Don't. I'm really embarrassed!
- Why?
We're family!
Listen, Egon...
I find her
a real good match!
Young she ain't,
but she's holding out!
- What are you saying?!
- Don't get mad...
...but it's true.
You could use some money...
I beg you, don't!
- I beg you!
- Why?!
- We've discussed it!
- You've ruined everything!
Why?
I'm so embarrassed!
I feel awful!
You stupid moron!
You've ruined everything!
Wait, don't go!
Stop, will you?
Women's frills...
Listen, she's still shy...
It'll pass.
You drunken ox!
You ruin every bit of fun!
Shut up!
Let's sing a tune!
You know what they say...
One song a day
keeps mischief away!
Give me a plane, I'll go
straight to Abyssinia!
Calm down!
- You embarrass me!
- You never understand me!
Fulir, you're a happy man
no one's pestering you!
Sure, Franjo, I can
understand you quite well.
Leave me alone!
Come!
Come down, if you dare!
You think you're special
'cause you're of silver?!
Lie down while madame
prepares supper.
I'm fed up with my office
so I like to relax...
...but she doesn't understand.
Some rest will do you good.
You know,
you're a nice guy.
We couldn't have found
a better one!
Perica...
He's asleep.
Would you bring us
a bottle of wine?
Here...
- Can I take the saber?
- Sure you can.
Charge!
I'll whisper sweet
words of love
- What are you doing?!
- Kissing you!
I never thought
you'd be so bad...
What will you think of me?
Charge!
- Franjo, don't!
- Sure I will?!
- What's going on?!
- They're fighting!
I'd strangle you
if it were legal!
- You bastard!
- Wait, Franjo...
Let me explain!
I close my eyes,
and you're on her!
Franjo! Franjo, wait!
Franjo!
You scoundrel!
You're dead!
I'll show you!
Where's the saber?!
- Here, Daddy!
- Give it to me!
- Is he gone?
- Yes.
He's really gone?
Perica, you say.
- Quite a new experience...
- For me, too!
I'm not talking to you!
You, a married wife,
letting him touch you.
- In my own house!
- I was resisting!
Didn't look like it!
Don't come near me!
It's over between us!
- Daddy...
- Don't you "daddy" me!
I won't divorce you
because of the child!
Get out of my sight!
Dad, I brought wine.
Perica, you love me, right?
People are swine. Never
open your heart to anyone.
I won't. But may I play
with your saber tomorrow?
You little twit...
Go to sleep.
I want to be alone.
No one knows how I
feel here... inside.
Dam ned Fulir!
I'll get you yet...
MONDAY
Don't cook for me.
Fr om now on I'm dead!
I'll eat at Znidaršiæ's.
- Good afternoon!
- Good afternoon, Mr. Šafranek.
My little wife
is a migratory bird
first kissing one,
embracing two
people are whispering
that I am a cuckold
"Love your fel ow-man,
those are words of God!"
Yes?
A moment, I'm changing!
- Let me go with you.
- You've no business here.
Tell Mom we're even now!
OK.
God, Mr. Šafranek!
Come on in...
Do come in.
Excuse me, we don't know
each other.
Well, we do, but we haven't been
formally introduced.
- Šafranek.
- Pleased to meet you. Marijana.
- Well?
- It's a bit complicated...
- May I sit down?
- Of course!
No offense, but I'd like you...
...to shut the window
and pull down the blinds.
- As usual.
- And why?
Please, do it as a favor.
I'll pay whatever it costs,
I respect your price.
Alright...
Excuse me, but it's
a little embarrassing.
What would Mrs. say?
Don't you worry about that.
That's precisely the point.
Just pull down the blinds.
Old devil!
I don't know the custom.
How much is it?
It depends...
Is 50 enough...
...for half an hour?
- That's too much!
I'm not stingy.
Here you are, thank you.
If you have some business
to attend to, go ahead.
I'll wait here quietly.
You're laughing...
Well, listen...
...since you have paid...
My respects to you.
But no, thanks. It's just
revenge on my wife.
Franjo!
Come out this minute!
Shame on you!
Who are you, madam?
I don't know you.
You know very well who!
Come out!
...Mrs. Fulir?
Tell your husband...
...I'll smash his head
on his name day!
Get out of there!
The scoundrel's not worth it!
There she is... the sow!
There he is, too!
What a disgrace!
HOW DAD ARRANGED IT ALL
Yesterday Dad went to
Znidaršiæ's to talk...
... about the League
of Nations and disarmament.
But there happened
an important thing.
He explained everything
to Dad...
... so they kissed
and made up again.
What happened next,
I don't know...
... therefore I can't write
about it. It would be a Iie!
THE END
