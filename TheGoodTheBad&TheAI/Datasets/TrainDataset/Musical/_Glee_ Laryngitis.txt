what happened
last week: Kurt found a video
of Sue, and the glee club
posted it online.
You, my friend,
are an embarrassment.
Then somebody made a "glist"
of who in the glee club
was the naughtiest, so Rachel
tried to seem like a bad girl
by doing a video
with Finn, Puck and Jessie,
but mostly it just
hurt their feelings
and the song
was really, really bad.
with Shelby Corcoran
and that, one time,
which totally hurt
Emma's feelings.
I'm through with you.
And that's what
you missed on Glee.
Who is that guy?
{bell ringing}
PUCK:
My mom found a mole on my head
when she was washing
my hair on Friday.
Your mom still
washes your hair?
She started crying
about sun block
and how she's always
telling me
to wear a hat
when I'm cleaning pools.
So, she made me go see Dr.
Friedlander, the dermatologist.
He said he had to shave my head
to get a closer look at it.
It was nothing-- they maimed me
over a freaking freckle!
I feel like that guy
that lost all his hair,
then lost all his strength.
Samson?
Agassi.
This morning, people
actually had the balls
to look me in the eye.
I mean, it's just
a Mohawk, right?
I'm still Puckasaurus.
Actually, I don't
know if it's
the missing Mohawk
or the whining,
but I am totally not
turned on by you right now.
You got a problem?
Clearly, you're not a follower
of my LarryHair account
on Twitter.
We've been tweeting all day
about your new look.
You're like a toddler with
a loose lid on his sippy cup.
No more juice.
Get ready for payback,
Puckerman.
{clucks tongue}
All right.
PUCK:
I'm human garbage.
I should just lie here
until the truck comes
What's the point of living
when I suck so bad?
{laughter, clapping}
{Mercedes vocalizing}
That black chick from Glee Club
used to suck,
and now she's all kinds
of popular.
MERCEDES:
¶¶ A Cheerio... ¶¶
If she can straighten
herself out, I certainly can.
I don't need
to be a cheerleader,
¶¶ Yeah, yeah... ¶¶
Get ready, black girl
from Glee Club
whose name I can't remembe
right now,
the Puckster is about
to make you his.
Um... wait, what are these?
My vitamin supplements.
I'm taking them
three times a day.
I'm exhausted.
I even felt a tickle
in the back of my throat,
and I never get sick.
Well, I just don't understand
why you're so tired
all of a sudden.
Because every song I
sing in here is a solo.
As you know,
I have perfect pitch,
which also means
I have a very sensitive ear.
I knew I needed proof,
so I had a little talk
with Lauren Zizes,
president of the AV club.
Bug the choir room?
I'm almost offended by
the simplicity of the request.
Just tell me
you can do it, Zizes.
The microphones
would have to be hidden.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
It'll cost you two boxes
of Mallomars for me
and Snicker bars for my workers.
Take it or leave it, Berry.

Here are the
glee club members
who are not pulling
their weight.
This is half the club.
{bell ringing}
{laughing}
Oh, man.
Hey, sugar. Listen.
I got a proposition
to make.
I did some research.
Blacks and Jews have a history
of sticking up for each other.
And Wikipedia says
that King Martin Luther
loved the Jews.
Okay, you just said
like ten offensive things.
My point is, you're popular now.
And I got to be honest--
I need to spice up
my image a little.
We should join forces.
It wouldn't take much.
Just a little light making out.
And I like a girl
with curves.
You got to admit,
I'm easy on the eyes.
Baby, I just am not
attracted to you.
Plus, I know what you do
to the girls you date.
You knock them up, and then
you hang them out to dry.
Quinn and I weren't dating.
She was dating someone else.
We just did the nasty.
And she understood
you can't tie me down.
I'm a sex shark.
If I stop moving, I die.
Okay, I'm going to ask you
to stop,
because I'm starting
to get embarrassed for you.
You and me would not work out.
We have nothing in common.
You're Top 40.
I'm rhythm and blues.
{bell ringing}
I am very disappointed
in you guys.
Can't believe you narced on us.
Don't get mad at me
for exposing your laziness.
I'm tired of carrying
all of your weight.
Regionals is in a month, guys.
WILL: I'm just trying
to understand
what's going on here.
Finn, why did you stop singing?
'Cause you started giving
all the male leads to Jessie.
It kind of shook my confidence,
you know?
{Santana sighs}
What difference does it make?
Everyone knows that my job here
is to look hot.
My baby hormones
are making me moody.
There are so many lyrics.
A chain is only as strong
as its weakest link.
A glee club
is about a myriad of voices
coming together as one.
All right?
This ends now.
Which is why your
assignment for the week
is for each of you
to come up with a song
that best represents
how you see yourself--
where you are
in your lives right now.
Your voice.
Then...
you're going to stand up here
and sing your hearts out.
All of you.
Solos?
In front of everyone?
The Glee Club
has lost its voice.
It's time for us to get it back.
{bell ringing}
I am going to kill
this assignment.
If there's one thing that
I know, it's my voice.
I have exactly the
same vocal range
as 16th century castrato
Orlando di Lasso.
But you know what
he didn't have?
A song by Ms. Whitney Houston
in his back pocket.
Hey, Kurt!
Dad? What are you doing here?
Is everything okay?
Oh, I'm here to pick up Finn.
I got a pair of tickets
to the Reds game,
and Carole said that Finn's
never been a major league game.
I mean, it's Cincinnati, so
it's barely the major leagues,
but still.
And why wasn't I invited?
{chuckles}
Are you kidding me?
Every time I sit down to watch
a game, you start in on the fact
that all the players are
wearing stirrup pants.
Because there's never an excuse
for stirrup pants!
FINN: Okay, I'm ready.
All right,
I'll meet you
by the car.
Okay.
This is gonna be so great.
It's gonna be great for Finn.
It means a lot to his mom, too.
Hey, I'll see you at home.
I'll be home around midnight.
{bell ringing}
Girl, you got more curves
than a Nissan ad.
Seriously?
That's what you
came up with?
WILL:
All right, guys.
Let's get things started.
As I was first on the
sign-up sheet,
I'll kick things off.
Okay.
I have chosen Miley Cyrus'
"The Climb,"
because it's about overcoming
obstacles and beating the odds.
In my case,
the obstacle is you--
my lackluster teammates
who refuse to carry
their own weight.
{gentle intro playing}
{off key}:
¶¶ I can almost see it ¶¶
¶¶ That dream I'm dreaming ¶¶
¶¶ But there's a voice
inside my head saying ¶¶
¶¶ "You'll never reach it" ¶¶
{voice cracking}:
¶¶ Every step I'm taking ¶¶
¶¶ Every move I make feels lost
with no direction ¶¶
¶¶ My faith is shaking ¶¶
¶¶ But I gotta keep trying ¶¶
¶¶ Gotta keep my head
held high... ¶¶
WILL:
Rachel...
I think you've lost
your voice.
ell ringing}      Hey, Ladyface.
I noticed you weren't at
Cheerios! practice yesterday,
and I don't look kindly
on absenteeism.
I'm so sorry,
Ms. Sylvester.
It won't happen again.
Something happened yesterday
that really upset me.
It's my dad.
He's the most important thing
in the world to me.
I love him.
And I'm afraid
that I might be losing him
because of... my... sexuality.
Your sexuality.
How old are you, 16?
Have you even kissed a boy?
No.
Have you ever kissed
a girl?
No.
Well, then how can you possibly
know what you like?
You see, that's the problem
with your generation.
You're obsessed
with labels.
So you like show tunes!
Doesn't mean you're gay.
It just means you're awful.
You know, there's only
one person in this world
who can tell you what you are.
Me.
No. Me.
Sue Sylvester.
And she hasn't quite
made up her mind about you.
Wait--
I have an idea.
Our assignment for Glee Club
is to find a song
that reflects our voice...
Yeah, you know what?
I checked out
of this conversation
about a minute back.
So, uh, good luck with
your troubles,
and I'm gonna
make a habit
not to stop and talk
to students,
'cause this has been a
colossal waste of my time.
Hey, Kurt...
you want to speak me?
Hey, Dad, yeah...
I was just, uh,
working on my Glee Club
assignment,
"Pink Houses" by
John Mellencamp.
Oh, really?
I didn't think that was
in your wheelhouse.
Yeah, I think it's really brave
for a Midwesterner like himself
to, uh, write a song about
such bold interior design.
You know, that's not
what the song's about.
Really?
No, it's about how the '80s were
a tough time for a lot of people
and how the American Dream
isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Hmm.
Fascinating.
Hey, why don't
we go grab
a couple burgers and, uh,
you can tell me
more about it?
Sure.
But I gotta be honest,
that's pretty much what every
Mellencamp song is about.
But you know what?
I'll get my coat.
Anything to help you out.
What if he says
I'll never sing again?
I mean, who am I
without my voice?
I'm just this spoiled,
annoying only child...
Don't say that.
There's, like, so many
awesome things about you.
Like?
Look, he's not gonna say
you'll never sing again.
Bad news, Rachel, you'll
probably never sing again.
I'm kidding.
You have severe tonsillitis,
which has resulted in an
inner ear infection.
From the looks of things,
it's not the first time.
You should have had them out
years ago.
Why should I let you
butcher my throat, when just
resting my voice for a week
and chugging down herbal tea
will do the same job?
This is
a very serious infection.
I think she's worried
about the surgery affecting
her singing voice.
DOCTOR: At least
start by taking
these antibiotics.
Unless you think they're going
to adversely affect
your dance moves.
{sighs}
What do you think I should do?
Maybe you should ask
your boyfriend.
Oh, wait, you can't,
He's not here.
He's in San Diego
on spring break
with his friends
from Vocal Adrenaline.
When are you gonna
realize that
he's not into you like I am?
You think he's gonna stick
around if you can't sing?
If you're a vocal cripple?
Look, I know that you've always
been jealous of Jessie.
And even though
he and I haven't spoken
since the "Run Joey Run"
debacle,
you just have
to accept the fact
that I still care
about him deeply.
And I know he still feels
the same way about me.
{guitar plays rock riff}
¶¶ Jessie is a friend ¶¶
¶¶ You know, he's been
a good friend of mine ¶¶
¶¶ But lately,
something's changed ¶¶
¶¶ And that ain't hard
to define ¶¶
¶¶ Jessie's got himself a girl,
and I want to make her mine ¶¶
¶¶ And she's watching him
with those eyes ¶¶
¶¶ And she's loving him with
that body, I just know it ¶¶
¶¶ And he's holding her in his
arms late, late at night ¶¶
¶¶ You know I wish that I had
Jessie's girl ¶¶
¶¶ I wish that I had
Jessie's girl ¶¶
¶¶ Where can I find a woman
like that? ¶¶
¶¶ And I'm lookin'
in the mirror all the time ¶¶
¶¶ Wondering what
she don't see in me ¶¶
¶¶ I've been funny,
I've been cool with the lines ¶¶
¶¶ Ain't that the way
love's supposed to be? ¶¶
¶¶ Tell me, where can I find
a woman like that? ¶¶
¶¶ Like Jessie's girl ¶¶
¶¶ I wish that I had
Jessie's girl ¶¶
¶¶ I want Jessie's girl ¶¶
¶¶ Where can I find
a woman like that? ¶¶
¶¶ Like Jessie's girl ¶¶
¶¶ I wish that I had
Jessie's girl ¶¶
¶¶ I want, I want
Jessie's girl. ¶¶
{band plays flourish}
{song ends}
{whooping}
WILL:
Nice work!
Now that-- that is
the kind of
soul-exposing song
I was talking about.
We should all be inspired
by Finn's bravery.
Good job, buddy.
Uh, Mr. Shue, can I
sing my song now?
Yeah.
Just go for it, Puck.
What are they doing here?
I invited my brothers
from the jazz band
and their righteous horns
to help me out with my song.
Since I shaved my Mohawk,
I started seeing things
differently.
Last week,
I joined a black church,
and I recently downloaded every
song Sammy Davis Jr.
ever recorded on iTunes.
He was a black Jew, you know.
And my inspiration.
So, without further ado, I give
you one of Sammy's biggest hits.

Look, Quinn,
I could never see myself
being into a guy like Puck,
especially since
he's your baby's daddy, but...
something just happened
between us.
I say... go for it.
What?
Look...
I screwed up by letting
Puck get me pregnant.
He's an idiot, and his mother
won't let me eat bacon.
I'm stuck living
with him right now,
but at least, if
you guys are dating,
I won't have to spend
so much time listening
to his insane theories
on how Super Mario Brothers
changed civilization.
But you do realize
he's using you
and your popularity
so he won't get
tossed in a Dumpster.
I know he's using me,
but in a way, it's even better.
I'm not you.
I've never had a guy like me
for anything, but now
I'm such a steaming mug
of hot chocolate
that one of the studliest guys
in school wants
to use me to harvest some mojo.
I just don't want
you getting hurt.
I know what this is.
My heart's safe.
Oh, I'm not worried
about your heart.
I might be okay with this,
but not even Puck is going to
be able to call off Santana.
{bell ringing}
All right, let's
get things started.
Mr. Shue, I'd like
to start us off.
I believe I've found a song
that finally expresses
my true voice.
Okay.
Gentlemen.
{band plays rockabilly intro
to "Pink Houses"}
¶¶ There's a black man
with a black cat ¶¶
¶¶ Livin' in
a black neighborhood ¶¶
¶¶ He's got an interstate
runnin' through his front yard ¶¶
¶¶ You know, he thinks
that he's got it so good ¶¶
¶¶ And there's a woman
in the kitchen ¶¶
¶¶ Cleanin' up the evenin' slop ¶¶

¶¶ Hey, darlin', I can remember
when you could stop a clock ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, but ain't that America ¶¶
¶¶ For you and me ¶¶
¶¶ Ain't that America ¶¶
¶¶ Somethin' to see, baby ¶¶
¶¶ Ain't that America ¶¶
¶¶ Home of the free, yeah ¶¶
¶¶ Little pink houses
for you and me ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, baby, for you and me. ¶¶
{song ends}
{weak applause}
Is there something wrong,
Mr. Shue?
I don't really think you got
the point of the assignment.
This was about
finding a song
that expresses who you are.
That song didn't
really sound like you.
Well, I'm sorry if I didn't
live up to your expectations.
No, no, this group needs
you to be you, Kurt.
You can literally do things
that no one else can.
I'm not a box.
There are more
than four sides to me.
Don't lose track
of who you are
just because it might be a
easier to be somebody else.
All right,
take five, guys.
Hey, Kurt...
that song was hot.
Oh...
{with a twang}:
Merci.
So you're pretty much the
only guy in this school
that I haven't made out with
because I thought you
were capital-G Gay.
But now that you're not,
having a perfect record
would mean a lot to me.
So, let me know if
you want to tap this.
{bell ringing}
Are you, like,
sleepwalking?
You have to be able
to sleep to sleepwalk.
I am on my third
day of antibiotics,
and I am not
getting any better,
which means, I'm going to
have to have that surgery,
which means, my life is over.
Don't you think you're being
a little dramatic,
I mean, even for you?
God, I'm so sick of you
feeling sorry for yourself.
Why don't you get it?
I am my voice.
I am like Tinkerbell, Finn.
I need applause to live.
I got a friend
I want you to meet.
Another doctor?
I've seen six already.
No.
No. He's an old friend of mine.
Your lip gloss
tastes like root beer.
It's weird.
Can I ask you something?
What do boys' lips taste like?
Usually dip.
Sometimes they taste
like burgers.
Or my armpits.
Kissing my armpits is a really
big turn-on for me.
{door opens and closes}
Whoa.
Am I interrupting
something?
{with twang}:
You sure are.
Okay, I'm confused.
I came home to find this note
on your doorknob--
"Do not enter
under any circumstances,
I'm making out with a girl."
I just thought
it was the start
of one of your
murder mystery dinners.
Dad, I really need you
to respect my privacy.
Brittany and I were just, uh,
having sexual relations.
{under breath}:
Hi.
Kurt, uh... I've been
sorta dealing for months
with you being gay
and everything,
and now you're telling me
that's not the case?
Dad, you and I have
more in common
than I would have thought.
The flannel, the Mellencamp...
the ladies.
Okay, well...
you're free to be
whoever you are, okay?
You just let me know when
you make up your mind,
I'm gonna do the best I can.
But I'm good either way.
Nice to meet you.
All right, you kids be
careful, all right?
And you gotta respect
her, all right?
And if things
get serious,
use protection.
Does he mean like
a burglar alarm?
{bell ringing}
So what made Super Mario
Brothers 3 so amazing
was the Star Worlds.
None of the other versions
had anything like that.
Look, Puck, I agreed
to start dating you
because you have great arms,
and we have serious
musical chemistry--
both of which are really
important to me.
But clearly you've never dated
a sister before.
And we have needs--
as in you need to stop
flapping your gums
about this video game nonsense
and start finding out more
about me, about who I am.
Okay.
I've never done that with a
girl before, but I'm cool.
First thing
you need to know is
I like those
frozen coffee drinks.
Do you want me to
get you one?
Decaf.
Cool.
What was that?
Whatever I did, I'm-I'm sorry.
Here, take my lunch money
as an apology.
Put that away.
Why didn't you look at me
when I walked by?
Well, the Tweetosphere says
you're dating Mercedes Jones.
She's one of the most popular
girls in school.
Your cool-o-meter is
off the charts.
Which means most of us
are terrified
of you again.
Some of the guys
who threw you
in the Dumpster
actually transferred today,
out of fear of retaliation.
I didn't say you could smile.
Give me that lunch money.
Also, my girl needs
a coffee drink.
{"The Boy Is Mine" intro
by Brandy playing}
Excuse me, can I please
talk to you for a minute?
Uh-huh, sure.
You know you look
kind of familiar.
Yeah, you do, too, but, um,
I just wanted to know,
do you know somebody named--
you know his name.
Oh, yeah, definitely,
I know his name.
I just wanted to let you know
he's mine.
No, no, he's mine.

Wow.
WILL:
That was intense.
Don't touch me.
Don't step to me.
I gotta give you guys props
for the passion.
Maybe hold back on
the animosity
Hey, hey, hey!
Seriously,
this ends now!
All right.
Talk to the stick
figure.
Please. All right?
You can go at it in song,
but that is it.
Enjoy it while you can, Weezie.
His hair is already
starting to grow back.
Calm down.
Hey, hey.
Puck, what the hell
is going on here?
Just a little payback.
{thud}
You hear that?
That's the sound of order
being restored.
No man of mine is gonna be
pulling stuff like this.
Babe, this is what we do.
Look at 'em.
They need this.
Without the fear
of a good Dumpster toss,
it'd be chaos
up in this place.
Look, you don't need to like it,
but you need to accept it--
this is the way
things are.
'Cause now, we're part
of the system.
We're at the top
of the heap.
Who's next?
{doorbell ringing}
Hi, uh, Mrs. Fretthold.
This is Rachel.
Pretty.
Uh, I'll tell Sean
you're here.
I'm sorry it's
such a mess.
I've been on the phone to the
insurance company all day.
Oh, no, that's fine.
Is this him?
FINN:
Uh, yeah.
We met at football camp
a couple years ago.
He's ready for you.
SEAN:
Fab-five-Finnster!
Fretter!
{chuckles}
This the hottie
you were telling me about?
Yeah. Sean Fretthold,
Rachel Berry,
Rachel, Sean.
Got a boyfriend, Rachel?
Um... sort of.
Sort of?
Sounds like I got a shot.
{whispering}: I don't
understand; this isn't funny.
Sorry.
They make me see a shrink.
He says I compensate with humor.
Third game of the season,
right after I met the Finnster,
this Yeti of a fullback
breaks through the line.
I hear a crack,
next thing I know,
I'm lying on the ground
saying to myself,
"Get up, get up,"
but nothing was working,
you know?
Sean was a C4.
Paralyzed from
the upper chest down.
I'm so sorry.
Finn says your voice
is messed up.
Is it going to come back?
I don't, I don't,
I don't know.
Pissed off about what you lost?
I was.
Like, real... rage.
I used to just lie in bed
and scream.
Finn shouldn't have brought me
here. I'm so sorry.
Wait, wait, wait.
Just...
tell her about what
happened when they
gave you the chair.
They were all excited
because I could
drive it myself
by blowing in that tube.
The second they left me alone...
I drove it
into the swimming pool.
His mom pulled him out
when she heard the splash.
I don't understand.
Are... Are you trying
to tell me
that you're happier now?
SEAN:
Hell, no.
I'm miserable.
I miss my body.
I miss my life.
I miss my friends.
I miss girls.
But I've realized, over time,
that I've got other stuff
going on.
I'm more than
just one thing.
You know I'm good at math?
Seriously.
I flew through Calc I
in like two months.
And I can sing.
He's actually pretty good.
I used to sing in the shower,
in the car...
I didn't have the balls
to try out for my school's club
like Finn did.
That pissed me off
more than anything.
What the hell was I afraid of?
{knocking on door}
Sorry, guys,
time for physical therapy.
FINN:
Later, dude.
Um, I'll come by
in a few weeks.
I'll be here.
Thanks.
For what?
Just, um... thanks.
Hey, mama.
Where's your Cheerios! uniform?
I quit.
Nobody quits the Cheerios!
You either die,
or I kick you off.
It was fun, I guess, but...
when I put the uniform on,
I didn't feel like myself.
It's just not who I am.
And what am I supposed to do
about that Mariah Carey number
in which you do ten straight
minutes of vocal runs?
Huh? Nationals is
in three weeks!
I guess I'll just
have to take to the mic
and deliver a diatribe.
Probably something
about immigrants.
Look, I know Glee Club may
be super nerdy or whatever,
but it's taught me
something very important.
You have to be true
to who you are.
That's something
you may want think about.
'Cause the guy I saw
throwing dweebs
in the Dumpster yesterday--
I don't like him very much.
And you know what?
I don't think
you do, either.
{bell ringing}
Your hands are really soft.
My secret? Duck fat.
Hey, guys.
Just holding hands
with Brittany.
Seriously.
They feel like a baby.
Now I know what it's
like to date a baby.
Hey, Kurt.
Dad. Hey.
Finn caught a foul ball
inhe ninth,
so that means free hoagies
at Lenny's Hoagies,
and then half-price
to the motocross tonight,
so I promised
I'd take him. Hi.
Can you excuse us
for a minute, boo?
What?
Just go away.
Did you ever think that
that might be something I wanted
to do with you?
Look, Kurt, Finn needs
a buddy right now, okay?
At the game, he got
to talking about his dad,
and, you know,
his mom thinks
it's a really
good thing for him.
Look, I promise you
we will hang out
as much as you want, okay?
Just not tonight.
¶¶ All that work
and what did it get me? ¶¶
¶¶ Why did I do it? ¶¶
¶¶ Scrapbooks full of me
in the background ¶¶
¶¶ Give 'em love
and what does it get ya? ¶¶
¶¶ What does it get ya? ¶¶
¶¶ One quick look
as each of 'em leaves you ¶¶
¶¶ All your life
and what does it get ya? ¶¶
¶¶ Thanks a lot
and out with the garbage ¶¶
¶¶ They take bows
and you're battin' zero ¶¶
¶¶ I had a dream ¶¶
¶¶ I dreamed it for you, Dad ¶¶
¶¶ It wasn't for me, Dad ¶¶
¶¶ And if it wasn't for me ¶¶
¶¶ Then where would you be ¶¶
¶¶ Miss Rachel Berry? ¶¶
¶¶ Well, someone tell me
when is it my turn? ¶¶
¶¶ Don't I get a dream
for myself? ¶¶
¶¶ Starting now,
it's gonna be my turn ¶¶
¶¶ Gangway, world,
get off of my runway! ¶¶
¶¶ Starting now
I bat a thousand! ¶¶
¶¶ This time, boys,
I'm taking the bows and... ¶¶
¶¶ Everything's coming up Kurt! ¶¶
¶¶ Everything's coming up
Hummel! ¶¶
¶¶ Everything's coming up Kurt! ¶¶
¶¶ This time for me! ¶¶
{laughs}
¶¶ For me! ¶¶
¶¶ For me! ¶¶
¶¶ For me! ¶¶
¶¶ For me! ¶¶
¶¶ For me! ¶¶
¶¶ For... me! ¶¶
¶¶ Yeah! ¶¶
{song ends,
one person clapping}
That was some
serious singing, kid.
That was "Rose's Turn."
I could get into that, maybe.
What happened
to the hoagies?
Ah, blew it off.
You know, too much cholesterol.
I bet Finn was disappointed.
He understood, uh...
once I told him how bent out
of shape I thought you were.
Me? I'm fine.
Kurt, I'm dumb,
but I'm not stupid.
And I have no idea
what that song was about,
but "fine" don't sing
like you just sung.
Look...
...maybe I got carried away
doing stuff with Finn.
But I told you, this thing
with you was going to be hard.
Thing with me.
You mean being gay?
Yeah.
Being gay.
Look, I will fight to the death
for your right to love
whoever you want,
but when you were a
little baby in my arms,
did I dream about taking
you to baseball games
and talking about girls?
Yeah, I did.
A lot of fathers do.
I had no idea
how disappointing I was.
Hey, come on, now,
stop it right now.
I'm-I'm talking
straight to you.
Don't go playing
the victim.
You know that's
not what I mean.
{crying}:
I know.
I'm sorry.
I know you're working hard
on yourself
to make all this okay.
Just seeing you,
the way you are with Finn,
how easy it is...
{voice breaks}:
It breaks my heart.
Is that why you were pretending
to date that daffy cheerleader?
And dressing differently,
and singing Mellencamp?
I just want you
to know that...
I'm going to work as hard
as you to make this okay.
You don't have to work
at anything, Kurt.
Your job...
is to be yourself,
and my job is to love you,
no matter what.
Okay? That
and a majority ownership
in a tire store--
that's all we got.
Okay? We stick to that,
we're going to be great.
I missed you, Dad.
Oh, come here.
I love you.
Love you, too.
Mom...
Finn with you?
No, I came by myself.
Is that okay?
Yeah.
I, um... I just
wanted to say thank you,
and for showing me that
just because I'm not good
at anything other
than singing doesn't mean
I'm not any good
if I can't sing.
That sounded like
a really bad greeting card.
No. It was cool.
Well, anyways, I...
I just thought I could
maybe return the favor.
I thought I could give you
singing lessons.
It sort of seemed like
an area of interest for you.
I'll-I'll come by,
like, once a week or
something, and we could just
see how it goes?
I've-I've helped almost everyone
in our glee club,
some by brute force, but...
So, your voice came back.
Turns out that a heroic dose
of antibiotics
and a mysterious blend
of herbal remedies
and a vow of silence
is all it takes
to cure tonsillitis, so...
I'll probably have
to have my tonsils taken
out eventually, but, um,
I'm-I'm not scared anymore.
{laughs softly}
Uh, so...
do you want
to give it a spin now?
Sing with you?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd be honored.
Come here.
Take my hand?
Can you feel that?
No.
But it's weird.
I remember what it feels like,
and I can see it, so...
it's like I can.
I-I, um...
{clears throat}
I thought we'd
do a little
classic rock today.
Finn said you
might like that.
Yeah.
¶¶ Is it getting better? ¶¶
¶¶ Or do you feel the same? ¶¶
¶¶ Will it make it easier
on you now? ¶¶
¶¶ You got someone to blame? ¶¶
BOTH:
¶¶ You say... ¶¶
SEAN:
¶¶ One love, one life ¶¶
¶¶ When it's one need,
in the night ¶¶
¶¶ One love,
we get to share it ¶¶
¶¶ Leaves you, baby,
if you don't care for it... ¶¶
¶¶ Did I disappoint you? ¶¶
¶¶ Or leave a bad taste
in your mouth? ¶¶
¶¶ You act
like you never had love ¶¶
¶¶ And you want me
to go without ¶¶
BOTH:
¶¶ Well, it's too late ¶¶
¶¶ Tonight ¶¶
¶¶ To drag the past out
into the light ¶¶
¶¶ We're one,
but we're not the same ¶¶
¶¶ We get to carry each other,
carry each other ¶¶
¶¶ One ¶¶
¶¶ Yeah, yeah, yeah ¶¶
{harmonizing}:
¶¶ One ¶¶
¶¶ One ¶¶
ALL:
¶¶ Love is a temple,
love is a higher law ¶¶
¶¶ Love is a temple ¶¶
¶¶ Love is a higher law ¶¶
¶¶ You ask for me to enter,
but then you make me crawl ¶¶
ALL:
¶¶ And I can't be holding on
to what you got ¶¶
¶¶ When all you got is hurt ¶¶
{harmonizing}:
¶¶ One love ¶¶
¶¶ One blood ¶¶
¶¶ One blood ¶¶
ALL:
¶¶ One life,
you got to do what you should ¶¶
¶¶ One life ¶¶
¶¶ With each other ¶¶
RACHEL:
¶¶ Sisters ¶¶
¶¶ Sisters ¶¶
ALL:
¶¶ And my brothers ¶¶
BOTH:
¶¶ One life ¶¶
¶¶ But we're not the same ¶¶
¶¶ We get to carry each other ¶¶
¶¶ Carry each other ¶¶
¶¶ One... ¶¶
SEAN & RACHEL:
¶¶ One ¶¶
¶¶ One... ¶¶
