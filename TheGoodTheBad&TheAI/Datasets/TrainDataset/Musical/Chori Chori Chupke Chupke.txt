Grandpa,when talks were on for
my marriage in this family!
I was scared!
-why?
I had once seen your photograph
in the Newspaper!
I thought,one who had such
menacing Monstache!
He'll definitely be strict and
will be like Hitler!
I've to be scared & put
the veil!
But after coming here,I came to
know that you're very Modern!
Now,I feel that you're not Raj
but my grandfather!
Madam,this time,we had a
great crop this reason!
Each branch bearing
Hey! were you plucking mangoes
or counting it?
Hey! Stop this fight and carry
on with your work!
This will go to Sharma's,keep
this in that basket!
And sister-in-law,this is
for kumar's!-Please give!
Put into that basket!
Madam,please take this!
Oh! My child,how many times I had
warned you not to lift heavy articles?
Take away those unripe mangoes!
Where did you go early
in the morning?
I went out for shopping!
What for?
For Maharana Pratap!
....I mean for the photo
of Maharana Pratap!
Why?
Because if a six months pregnant woman
whatever she watches more!
..The child will imbibe
those qualities!
If we keep this photograph
in Priya's bed room!
Then the coming child will also be
courageous like Maharana Pratap!
Have you gone mad?
If he becomes like RanaPratap!
...He'll be fighting with a sword
all his life in Jungles!
We must make the child a
great cricketer only
What will he do becoming
a circketer!
Unnecessarily he will get trapped
into match fixing!
Our child should become a
great leader!
...One who'll march this
nation towards progress!
So,In the bedroom of Priya...
What happened?....
Have you slept?
...I am thinking about which leader's
photograph should I hang there?
Can this humble man suggest
a thing?
Come on tell?
It can solve the problem of
all the three!
Keep some film Actor's
photograph in her room!
He can do,Leader's role cricketer's
Role,& even Rana Pratap's Role!
How good had it been
if you were quiet?
Leader's photograph-
Leader's photograph!
Why are you unnecessarly
fighting anmong yourselves?
Yes,my child,come on tell!
Why are you getting tensed
up for me?
I've already hanged the photograph
which I like the most!
what?
Oh!
Catch it!
Oh! I've broken my back!
What's this Bansi?
How can it be out,Grandpa!

Out means ...out!
What's this?
Mother,Grandfather's cheating!

You go and bat,I'll do
the umpiring!
Anyhow,you'll be out at the first ball

in my lap!
...And was laughing!
Exactly like Raj!
Similar eyes...similar smile!
As I bent my head to

In that happiness tears
rolled out of my eyes!

the problem in it?

What?!!
Today,grandfather dreamt of a Raj
a replica of you! Playing in his lap!
He doesn't want anyone,he wants
your progeny only!
Now you only tell!
How can we play on their sentiments
by calling an adopted as your son!
I am at the disadvantage!
I can't become a mother!Raj
But you can become a
father,isn't it?
Agree to it. Raj.please!
The accident which you had,
If it had happened to me!
Would you've married again?
Look!

who was like me,but now has a child!
The only differece is that the womb
was of a different woman!
You mean test tube Baby?!
No,our family is so famous that this
test tube matter will never be a a secret!
That's means you
want me to.....
Yes Raj,if we get a girl who
could give birth to our child!
Look,If I wanted to beget a child
from some other woman!
Why would I have refused
for the marriage?
Why would I have talked about
adopting a child?
Because,I love you so much!
..And I don't want to share
it with anyone
Raj! We'll get difficulties
freely!
For your child I am ready to share
your love with other woman also!

-She's a friend!

She's a good girl!
She's a good girl! But she's

Who's not a street smart man here?
Are you not a street smart man?
I too....
What was the necessity for
you to come down?
What was that urgent work for

If you're ashamed of me,why didn't

You could've locked me up in

not sell to girls like me.

show my anger on food!
If you want

She has become mother
Ten lakhs-ten lakhs!
Congratulations Raj
Bless daughter-in-law on
my behalf
Listen you take the 1st
flight & come here
No no grandpa,that is
not possible
Because according to doctor,Priya is not
allowed to take a long flight
Alright don't come!
Don't bring the
daughter-in-law at all
But look after daughter-in-law
over there
What's happining grandpa?
Here talk to your mother
Son Raj-yes mother!
Raj,congratulations may God
give my life also to you
Give phone to daughter-in-law
I won't give,one second!
Wish you a long happy life
don't lift heavy things
Yes yes
And the Charan that I had given you
tie it on the wrist
Tie it on your hand
And take care of
daughter-in-law
Congratulations,kept
the phone down
What's this? It has
sacred flowers in it
Mother-in-law has given me for
the protection of the child
Always keep it on your hand
It'll protect the child
See it's months,there is no
bulge on the stomach
It won't come in 3 months only
after 5 months it'll show
When I was expecting last time
I was also worried like you
Mother-in-law had told me
Mother-in-law! she's a
dangerous creature!
No,my mother-in-law
is not like that
She is very nice,she loves
me a lot
And grandpa of Raj...
He doesn't consider me as daughter-in-law
I am the grand daughter to him
Who else is there
in your family?
Grandpa's friend,
Doctor Uncle!
Uncle,Auntie &
one Pappu brother
He has very high contacts
If any phone goes out of
order in the house
He won't phone the mechanic
He'll phone the telecome
minister directly!
And his winking habit puts every
new person in a quandry
Your inlaws place would be very
interesting,isn't it?
Day must be passing off
very quickly
It was like that earlier,but
since that happened with me
But those days'll
return again
Congratulations Raj!
Our company has crossed the sales
of 10 millions
It's nothing,It'll cross more than
Hello sister-in-law,how
are you?
I am fine
She's my friend,Madhu
And he is Ajay,friend of Raj
and a businessman
Come Madhu
Yes Madhu,you are our VIP
Hey son,come here!
Raj,Vicky brother
has come
Brother,sister-in-law
hasn't come
Day after tomorrow,my son's head
shaving ceremony is there,isn't it?
That's why she is busy there
but I've come,isn't it?
And I've come to remind
you people
That both of you must come for the
ceremony day after tomorrow
I was thinking for a long time
as to where I had seen you
Wonderful
What a great change
has come over
After seeing you nobody can say
that you're a prostitute
Who told you?
There is no secret
between me & Raj
I also appreciate good things
If the commodity is good
I don't bother about money
As soon as you're free
from Raj,come over!
What ever Raj is paying you
I'll give you double than that
Why did you come away
from the party?
I don't want to stay here
I'm going back
What happened? did any one
say something?
All rich people like you
are alike
You play so many games
for your selfish ends
First you gave me so much respect
elevated me to the sky
And with one jerk you pulled me
back to earth
You wanted only a child
isn't it?
That I would have produced on
the road also
What was the need to mature me
for your society
When you had to tell your friends
that I'm a prostitute
I never felt so cheap,when I was
in the proffession
The way I am feeling
today
Did Ajay say anything
to you?
Madhu,I haven't said anything
to anybody
Ay Madhu,where are
you going?
I am going back,he told
his friend that I....
That I am pregnant
Ican't dance
Madhu Raj & I are your friends
your well wishers
We'll never say anything
that'll hurt you
You want to dance,come..
I don't want to dance
A person who thinks someone
as his own
He get's hurt by trifles
Priya,I didn't tell you one thing
about Madhu
I know,I have heard
everything
You did the right thing by
not telling me this earlier
May be after knowing the truth
I might not have accepted Madhu
But today,I can say
To give birth to our child
There couldn't have been a
better girl than Madhu
Isn't it?
How is Madhu?
I'm just coming from her room
she's still angry
If we both go for the head shaving
ceremoney without her
Then she'll feel very bad
Then we'll also not go
No..No..Vicky brother will be offended
We'll do onething,I'll go for the
function,you stay here
I'll give the excuse that you couldn't
come because of business compulsions
Okay,pack your things,I'll drop
you at the station,come
Drink this juice
Cigarette is healthy to your
and child's health
Madhu I know you're upset
But,when you came to
the Bombay confrence
The way you had dressed up
the way you had behaved that...
Ajay was also present there
When I didn't tell this to
my wife Priya
Then why would I tell
it to Ajay?
Even then if you feel I've
made a mistake
Smoke the cigarette
You were bathing?
Raj is not at home,he has
gone to the office
Yes I know Raj has gone
to the office
And,he'll come back late
And Priya is also not at home
she has gone to her cousin
That's why I've come!
From the time,I saw you at
the party
I couldn't control myself
That's why I came here at the
very 1st opportunity
I've enjoyed with
every type of Girl
But,the attraction that you have
nobody else has it
You please go away
from here
Yes,I have understood
You're in contract with Raj that's
why you're in tension
There is no problem between
me and him
He is not only my business partner
but my childhood friend also
He'll have no objection
You cheap prostitute
you slapped me!
Come on,get up...get up
over here..
You're pretending to be
very decent,isn't it?
I'll smash your decency
Raj I had thought,that....
What did you think?
That,you'll rape her?
you'll rape her?
Raj,what are you doing you'll rape
her?listen to me
Raj listen to me
You'll rape her
Raj,listen to me
Raj,what are you doing for a cheap
prostitute you're beating me
Does she look a cheap
prostitute to you?
I don't find her that way
How did she look like
that to you....?
Raj for such a girl you're beating
your childhood friend
Childhood friend!
Even if you were my brother
I would have killed you
Raj for her you're endangering
partnership worth 500 crores
Why 500 crores for her
For her,I'll forsake the entire
wealth of the world
Do you know,why? because she
is priceless for me
You're my friend,isn't it? that's
why you leave from here
Otherwise I'll kill
you,understod
Go..go..
I'll bring medicines
If you need anything
call me
Madhu,take this
What were you thinking?
I was remembering my
childhood
When I was a kid
My mother always used to
tell me a story
That,there was a poor girl
Oneday a prince came to her
on a white horse
And took away his bride
And then,all her dreams
came true
Even I used to see this same
dream all the time
When I grew
Instead of white horses many
white cars came
Many princess got down
from them
But nobody came to
take me with him
All came to purchase me
Then I realized
That it was a fairy tale for
children in their childhood
It doesn't happen like that
in reality
Raj & Priya will be shocked
to see us
Ay Chotu,take down the
luggage quickly
How can I take
down so much?
Come with me
Priya,grandpa has come with
the entire family
What?
Is that your family?
Priya,it'll be a catastrophy,they think
that you're pregnant
One second
No no,it'll be too big!
This....
Yes,this is alright
Wear this charma also
But there are sacred
flowers in it...
Yes yes,I know,give her the flowers
and you wear the charm
Yes
Daughter-in-law,we have
come
Where are you,you'll be
overwhelmed
Oh Grandpa,Mother
Grandpa
May you live long
Mother....
-we surprised you,isn't it?
God bless you,my son
You came without
informing
We couldn't wait to see Priya,so
we have come-where is Priya?
She is tying the pillow
Tying the pillow!
Tying the pillow! what did
you all hear?
What did you say?
She is changing her dress
Come my child,come....
My child....
Blessings mother
God bless you,you have given us the
entire happiness of the world
No..no child don't bend
down,God bless you
Let me stop the evil eye
falling on you
Oh! Grandpa...
How are you my child?
I am fine
How are you,Pappu brother
Hai! Uncle
How are you Priya child?
Didn't I tell you that you'll
be pregnant within a year,isn't it?
What mother,why did you all
give us such a surprise?
What happened?
what happened?
She is the wife of my
friend,Madhu
Her husband generally stays away
for business
There is no one else in the house
that's why she stays with us
I see....
You did the correct
thing my child
At this time you shouldn't
live alone
Come...come here
Blessings....
Always be happy
I'm Priya's mother-in-law
I know
Priya daily tells me
about you all
You are auntie,you are uncle
and you are Pappu brother
And you're grandpa
Blessings
Don't bend down
blessings
And you are the father
Grandpa won't you take away
the evil eye frome me?
Why not,may you live long
and married
It's not surprising why our
dark hero Mithun stays in Ooty
So that,he looks fair among
the people who stay there
Grandfather....Biscuts
Madhu my child,what is
your Husband's business?
He!....
He is into Import & Export
Yes grandpa,that's why he is sometimes
in UK,Austrlia!....
He's always out of station
I see...
Whatever it may be business
will anyways go on
But in such times,a husband should
necessarily be with his wife
Daughter-in-law,no problem
Like the way,we'll take
care of our Priya
In the same way,we'll
take care of her too
After listening to this God Vishnu
started crying after becoming a child
And after seeing that beautiful
face of him
Tears of affection & happiness rolled
out from mother Kausalia's eyes
They say,if the description of
God Rama's birth
Is heard by a pregnant woman
Even her child likes it
You just feel and watch
There definitely would be some
movement going on inside
Madhu child,why are you
standing there,come here & sit
Come....come...sit
Listen,at the time of
God Rama's birth
The condition of
his father Dashrath
Because,the amount of happiness which
the mother undergoes in delivering it's child
The father feels
twice of her
Child,what are
you thinking?
That your husband is not
with you,isn't it?
He definitely would be
helpless about this
But he always would be thinking
about you & your child
Poet Tulsidas said....
Priya,my child
-yes mother
Child,this is that
spicy sweet
Do you remember?
I have brought it for you
from Delhi
Madhu come...
Mother has brought for me spicy
sweets from Delhi
You'll really be benefitted
if you eat it..eat.....
It's spicy,isn't it?
Last year,when I was expecting even
I found them very spicy
That's why mother forcibilly made
me eat,making me sit infront of her
Will you have one more?
Mother is coming,don't say
that I had it
Yes mother
Oh! you are here,I was searching
you in your room
I was sitting with
Grandpa
What's the matter,you
are crying?
No...I was watching a melodramatic
film,that's why
Come with me
Sit down,carefully....
Madhu child,these are
spicy sweets
After eating it,both the mother & the
child are benefitted a lot
Come on eat it....
Mother,no I'll eat it later
No....not later,you'll have to eat it
before me,otherwise,you'll not
No...mother.-I know it's a little
spicy that's why
Come on,open your mouth
open...good-No...
Madhu,there's a lot of
swelling on your feet
I had told the Doctor about it
but he said,it's quite normal
It definitely happens,but a
lot of swelling is not good
I'll apply oil on your feet
made of 7 herbs
It reduces the swelling
Yes madam
Bring that oil made
of 7 herbs
I'll get it
Keep it
Show me my child
No..No mother,I'll not like
you touching my feet
But,I'll like it
Once,that I have adressed
you as my daughter
I also mean it
from my heart
You are my daughter
isn't it?
Who all are there in
your family?
Mother,I have no one
There must be someone in
India,isn't it?
I have no one
in the world
Hereafter,don't ever say,that
I have no one in the world
From now,this entire
family is yours
Greetings Mr.Priest
how are you?
Yes one minute
Grandpa...it's Mr.Priest's
phone from Delhi
What's the number of
the facility Minister over here?
Yes Mr.Priest...greetings
Whose phone is this?
What was he saying?-I don't know
Alright we'll do exactly
as you say
You make the arrangements
yes.. okay...
Grandpa, what
arragements?
Raj, Mr.priest has chosen 18th as the
date for priya's lap filling ceremony.
Congratulations.
We''ll go to Delhi tomorrow itself,
okay
Raj, how can we go
back to India?
Even Madhu has to be with us,
isn't it
Because,18th has been fixed as
priya's lap filling ceremony
You go along with Raj to the
office, call for a board meeting
And make everyone understand
-yes father
Grandpa,is it not possible,if
you call Mr.priest here itself?
And acomplish the ceremony
here itself.
Why?
Because, Priya's delivery date
is also of this month
And ...,the medical facilities
over here are also very good
What are you talking
about facilities?
I'll make one phone and get
all the facilities transferred to Delhi
There is no facility of a
minister itself over here
I see..., Bihar is a
better place than this
Raj my son. We''ll get all the
madecal facilities in Delhi
And such a ceremony is done
at that place
Where there are friends,
relatives etc.
Mother, you are right.
We''ll all go to lndia.
Madhu, I had promised
your husband.
That I'll take
care of you.
But,we are all going to India
for the lap filling ceremony
Because, your's of Priya's delivery
date,fall on the same day.
And I can never go
against Grandpa.
But, I'll do all your hospital
bookings etc
And whenever you get the
labour pain.you yourself go.
Have you gone out of
your brains?
How will this poor go alone to the
hospital in such a condition?
Grandpa, she does'nt have
any other alternative also,isn't it?
Who is with her,and she also can't
come to India with us.
Why can't she come?
You had promised her husband
isn't it
Yes, I had
Everybody listen,this is
my decision,
That, Madhu will come
to Delhi along with us
Greetings...
Greetings...
He is my father, and they
are my brother & sister-in-law
What have they brought?
An auspicious offering
In the lap filling ceremony,
the pregnant woman.
Wears clothes brought only from
her parent's house
Great..., Is this such
a big ceremony?
Blessings...
Come... come...
Greetings... come
Pappu,Just listen, Mr.Priest
is asking for rice
Please make the
arrangement
should I call the
food minister
Tell me,how many bags
you want?
Oh god,for a handful of rice,
will you call up the minister
Handful..
Bring it from the kitchen
Allright
Have you seen Bhati uncle
somewhere?
I haven't,but,what's
the matter?
Are you immitating me?
Did your mother ever come & go
at fathehpur's red bungalow?
Fathepur's Red bungalow, No,
my mother never went
My father freequently
visited there
Father always used to say
that son,you have one sister
Father...
Priya, your auspicious dress has come,
now soon get ready
Mother, you go down, I'll
make Priya get ready
No Daughter, you can't
come down
Look,I wanted both of yours
ceremonies to be performed together
But Mr.Priest said,that two
pregnant women together
Can't participate in
this function
Allright mother
And Priya my child,today get ready
exactly like a bride,fully decked up.
Allright
This ceremony is a very important
event in any woman's life
Because a woman does'nt have
one birth,but she has 3 births
The first when she becomes someone's
daughter & comes into this world
The second,When she becomes
someone's wife.
And the third,when she
becomes a mother
And why this ceremony is performed bofore
a woman becomes mother is because
That the forthcoming child gets
so many blessings & prayers
that its birth is not
with pains
But its with
happiness
Now, soon get ready & come down
the time for the ritual is nearing.
Allright
Raj,you here,now don't
involve priya in your talks-
She has to get ready & come down
allright
Raj,I can't come in this
function
Why?
Mother said, that this is
not any ordinary ritual-
All these prayers etc are for the
well-being of our child
Madhu should sit in this
ritual instead of me
But,how is this possible?
If madhu wears my
Bridal dress-
The veil would be there
isn't it?
And nobody will come to know
that she is Madhu
Madhu,will you wear the
auspicious dress?
Allright
Sister-in-law,just see if priya
has got ready or not?
Bring her at once
Allright sister
Aunty,I'll go & see
-mother,I'll go
Saw,allright,you
itself get her
Who's it?
It's me
Has madhu got ready?
Yes
Girls...
The auspicious thread...
I forgot
Listen.. I'll make her wear
you go
Alright,I'll go that side
make it fast...
The one who is going to furnish
my clan with a heir,I salute you
May God let your child
live forever
And the way, how sun shines
the entire world-
In the same way,your child
should shine my entire generation
May god, my age should add
to your child
And he brings so much
happiness in your life
That no happiness of the world
can match against it
Priya,Great,the color of heena has
blended so thick on your hands-
This means,Raj loves
you a lot
We have to take a family
photograph,come everyone come
Yes, take the photograph
Mr.priest, you start
the prayers
Allright
What is the name of the
child's great grand father?
May this great grandchild receive
all the happiness of the world
What is the child's
grandfather's name?
May this child receive
all the fame
What is the child's
grandmother's name?
May god bless this child
What is the child's
father's name?
May god make this
child live forever
Mother...
Today's function was great
isn't it?
Excellent, what was
the best among it?
Great grandfather's Dance,
what do you say?
What stromy winds are blowing
I'll get these windows closed
Look,it's too late,
you go and sleep
God bless you
Did you see Madhu
anywhere?
What?
Madhu,where are you going?
This child's mother is not
Priya Malothra,its me
This is my child,I'll not give my child
forgive me,I can't give this child
Madhu, don't say like this
For the last 9 months I have
undergone penance for its birth
Everyday I have weaved one new
dream for this child
At this time, not
only me or Raj-
But our entire family is counting
days for the childs birth
Madhu,all our happiness
is linked with it
I'll kill myself,but I'll
not part with my child
Madhu, you don't lack anything
unlike me,you can get married
You can again experience
motherhood
But I... I am incomplete,
I can never become a mother
Madhu,I beg of you,please
give me this child
In return of it,I'll give you
what ever you want
Allright,I am prepared to
give you my child
Can you give me
your husband?
After all,you showed your
true colour
I thought even a prostitute
was a woman
But you've proved that a prostitute
can never do good to anyone
She can only destroy
houses
I asked you your
husband from you
You made me remember
my status
You are asking form
a mother,her progeny
Mother,whether she is
a prositute
Or a daughter-in-law
of a house
Mother is only a mother
I'll not... I'll not give
you my child, I'll not...
Raj,she is refusing to
give us our child
Priya,but first look
at her condition
Immediately call up
doctor uncle
Everthing wil get allright
Madhu's scanning is
in progress
In a very short while,we'll
come to know the complications
It's mother's phone..
Yes mother
You,priya,Madhu all the
three of you are not in house?
Where are you all?
Mother,we're all
at the hospital
Madhu and priya had
developed labour pains-
So,I've brought them here
We all are reaching
the hospital
No mother no,you come at ease
okay,doctor uncle is with us
Oh god! I am
just coming.
Doctor has called you in.
The child in the stomach
has turned around-
That's why the child is not
at it s normal position.
All right,go ahead.
But,the condition
is serious.
I can either save the mother
or child in this operation
We'll have to take the decision
at the earliest
Doctor,you save
the mother.
Make arrangements to take
her to the operation theatre.
Nurse,take Raj's signature
-okay
Take her in,
careful....
This happens very rare,the
operation was sucessful.
Both Madhu and
child are safe.
Congratulations,its
a boy baby.
How sweet child it is.
You wanted to save the mother
Isn't it.
Even the mother
got saved.
And your child too.
I got carried away for a while
and became selfish.
You are this
child's mother.
He is only yours.
Give me my Grandson...
Look....Look I am your
Great Grandfather.
Oh yes,what about our madhu
a boy baby or a girl baby?
That poor girl's child
at its birth....
No child,don't get
disheartened.
Think that it was
not yours.
The same thing happened
even with our priya-
But did you see,in 1 year's time
god blessed her with another child.
Yes daughter
Madhu,don't go I'll disclose
the truth to my family members.
When two Brother's can stay
together,under one roof.
Then why can't two
sister's stay?
I have got my complete
family here.
I only lacked
a sister.
Today,I even
got that
Let this sister remain
as sister.
Don't make her
a co-wife.
Otherwise,no woman would ever
have belief on another woman.
Only you have rights on
this family,and on Raj.
My rights are only on those
remembrabces,which I got here.
What more do
I want?
Madhu,you have been checked-in
This is your boarding pass.
Your bags have been sent
into the luggage.
In this,there are keys
of your new house-
And some blank cheques
on your name.
The deed which you have done
for me and for priya.
For that,even if I give you
my entire wealth-
Even then,its less.
Just consider this to be a
small gift from me & priya.
I have taken my gift,
look at this-
I am taking my entire
family along with me
Other than this,If I take
anything else,it'll look as though-
A mother has taken a price
for her child.
But Madhu,you....
I'll not return back to that world
from where you had brought me.
You had touched me once,here after
no one else can touch me!
