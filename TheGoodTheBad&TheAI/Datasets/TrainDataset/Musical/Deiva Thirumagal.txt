God's own child
Who is this...early in the morning?
Lift him up
City of Chennai welcomes you
No-good nut case! Get lost
You don't want your money?
Nila...?
What?
Nila
You lost someone?
I'll tell you where to go
Keep this in your shirt
Not in your pant pocket
What's your name?
Where are you from?
Krishna
...from Avalanchi
Chocolate factory
Gate...cows
Give me time to write
Repeat what you said
- What's your name?
- Krishna
What do you want?
I want Nila
Nila is missing
Doesn't look like you lost someone
You are the one who seems lost!
- Someone must be searching for you
- I want Nila
This is a police station
You shouldn't be here
Come with a friend, relative or a lawyer
You'll find a lawyer in court
It's time to go to the court
Shall we leave?
Make sure everyone boards the van
Rape or drugs? Tell me what case
We'll take you out in a jiffy
Go in like this
Out in a jiffy like that
Go in...get out
We'll take you out in a jiffy
What are we here for?
Hey! You there!
How did you get in here?
Get down
This one is without a lawyer!
Go in like this
Out in a jiffy like that
- What's your case?
- Murder
- How many?
- One
Just 1? I expected much more from you
- Whom did you kill?
- Lawyer who defended me and lost
You are my lawyer from now on
I am not a lawyer
I'm a tea shop owner
How come you are dressed this way?
Because it's so cold, sir
You have even started
selling tea and coffee, sir?
- Looks like that will be my job!
- How can you say that, 'Mr Lawyer'?
- What did you call me?
- 'Mr Lawyer'
Looks like I myself need to be reminded
Why don't you get me a case?
Look at that man over there in a sweater
Catch hold of him
Good one?
My boss is a very experienced lawyer
You can go in like this
Be out in a jiffy like that
You don't worry about it
Stop!
Grab him, sir
He claims he will kill a lawyer
Kaatumiraandi! Senseless savage!!
Dented tin-head!!
Many a miss between
the mouth and the magistrate!
Don't you worry, sir
Come in
Please be seated
I've got hold of a super client
Come to our room immediately
I'm inside the court room
Call me later
it's not as if you are defending a case
You are just gaping at the proceedings
Come out
I never thought
I'll get back my property so soon
- Anu, how long?
- I'm coming
I only wanted
what's my rightful inheritance
You blatantly lied
that I am not my dad's son!
If you had come to me first
I'd have said the same about him
I'll take care
How many times
to tell you not to call me 'dear'?
Why are you irritated?
You haven't got a case till now?
Mind you r business!
It's some missing case
Imagine! He must be filthy rich to
roam around Chennai wearing a sweater!!
He must forever be used
to air conditioning
I'll call you discreetly from inside
Let's pretend to be in great demand
We are dependent on him this month
Don't mess it up as usual
That's my business card for you
How can I help you?
Who are you?
Where did you come from?
Krishna
Goats...cows
Not cows
Lots of trees
There's a huge tree
There's major feud
between the Ambani brothers
They want you to fly to Delhi tonight
I'll tell them you won't come
without completing this case
You were saying...
Gate...goats...cows
There's a huge tree
Your client is waiting out with
Rs 150000 for winning his case
I'm so sorry I blurted
your fees in front of our client
You continue...
That huge tree
Is he still at that same tree?!
I put chocolates into a bag...tie it...
Goats and cows lying down by the roadside
I'll be right back
What are you up to?
Urgent case
She needs to get divorced
She's getting married this evening
You got to help her right now
Listen to me
Nila  will be seen tonight
We'll hold it safely for you
You come back tonight
You couldn't have found a better case!
How did I know he'd be a nut case?
Go and get a good case
Serves me right for not studying well!
Why is he still here?
You ask me to bring in a case for you
Then you ask me to pack him off
What do you take me for?
'Use and throw'?
Fine...how do we go out now?
Drink this tea
I have ordered lunch
Usually we try to get our client out
Now, we are breaking our heads
how to get ourselves out!
What's this new case I'm unaware of
That's a political recommendation
You blabbered to that man
you won't grant him divorce!
What are you glaring at me for?
Pig faced bum...grab him
He threatens to kill lawyers
Kaatumiraandi! Barbaric beast!!
Put him behind bars
We can't, sir
He is out on bail
If you are free you can visit my shop
Grab a bite and a cup of tea or coffee
Let's run this way
Mr Sweater is there
This nutcase
How many times to tell you?!!!
He had Anu's card
I found him for you
This place is swarming with maniacs!
Get lost
You want Nila?
We'll go bring it for you
You be here
Don't follow us
We'll be back soon
Just wait for us here
Moon...moon
When, where, whom
we meet can be pre determined
Are you Anu?
Court closes at 6:00 P.M
We asked him to leave
We even beat him to a pulp
He's refusing to budge from here
We found your business card on him
Do you know him?
You promised...to bring Nila...for me
It seems he is Krishna
He is mentally challenged
Avalanchi is a small village near Ooty
I found out a Mr Victor
owns Emerald chocolate factory
He's the only person to know
Krishna 's story fully
They took Nila away
I want my Nila
Please wait out...
if he gets too emotional
his blood pressure will rise
Who is Nila?
Is Nila his wife?
Or his sister?
Who is Nila?
Hey look there! What's Krishna up to?
Get down
You should be in your home
You shouldn't be down
You are such a tiny baby
Why are you so happy?
I'll soon have a baby of my own
A mini girl or boy
She or he will ask me
to buy many a cuddly toy
From today I'll dance and rejoice
...in absolute joy!
I'll soon have a baby of my own
A mini girl or boy
She or he will ask me
to buy many a cuddly toy
From today I'll dance and rejoice
...in absolute joy!
It will take an hour for me
to reach Cunnoor
How slow can you be...no fear at all
Relax! Don 't be angry
Krishna isn't here...that's wh y
What did he say?
Cat got your tongue?
I can't digest it myself
You won't be able to bear it
You are better off not knowing
I am better off not knowing?
What did he say?
Where are you going?
I want to see Victor
Aren't you working?
I am having a baby
I won't be working
Now that you are here you might
as well tell me loud and clear
I am having a baby
I won't be working
We must deliver the chocolates in time
Only you can do it,
we can't trust these guys
Be a sport
What are you doing here?
Murthy asked me to work
I swear on my wife
I didn't ask him to work
He has to be in hospital
Why are you delaying him?
I agree totally
What are you doing here?
Krishna never lies
Did Bhanu give you a list?
Murthy, drop Krishna in the market
when you go for delivery
Buy everything, go to the hospital
I'll see you later
What do you have to buy?
I 'll buy kaajal for her twinkling eyes
Tiny anklets as a tinkling device
Oh! 1 more in my to-do list
Why don't I remember what it is?
A blue shirt for that pretty face
I'll add a pink dress just in case
Let me shop till I drop
On a horse I'll gallop!
All for the baby?
Nothing for Bhanu?
Oh! You bet Bhanu will get
An apple to keep the doctor away
Horlicks in milk everyday
Bhanu, my love so fair
just like my baby I shall care
Jeweled necklace like a crown
Waist thread to show my baby has grown
Oh right here...this is it!
- Is this also for Bhanu?
- No, for the baby
I'll soon have a baby of my own
A mini girl or boy
She or he will ask me
to buy many a cuddly toy
No need
Krishna, should the baby
be like the mom or dad?
Not a carbon copy of her dad
...nor like his mom, for I'll be glad
...if God decides to add
a bit of both mom and dad!!
Baby should laugh with joy never be sad
Is this that beautiful laughter?
What do we get when the baby is born?
Lots of chocolates shall be my treat
Whole of Ooty will enjoy a feast
What else shall I add to my wish list?
I'll think and tell you what it is
Okay, what will you do with the baby?
I'll watch him play...with other kids
Tease hen..mock fight with counter bids
What else will I do...?
- What will you do?
- I'll ask Bhanu and tell you
You won't play with Bhanu?
Apparently I have to wait
for 300 days long
It seems the baby
has to grow real strong
Till then I'll Middle my thumbs and wait
So said the doctor that's my fate!
Take this with you
- Where are you going?
- I'm having a baby
You've got a baby girl
I gave your hand back to you
I am your daddy
Does she look like me or Bhanu?
Where is Bhanu?
Bhanu isn't here
She has to nurse the baby
When will she come?
Where has she gone?
She's with God
Take one last look
Fair moon...silver moon
Fluffy cloud here's looking for you
Precious image of you asleep
on my chest dissolves into a tear so blue
You are sitting there
oblivious to the baby's cries
What should I do?
My dear life, without you
I am not alive today
- Babies need milk once in 3 hours
- Really?!
Only because of you
my heart is shattered honestly
I remember...l reminisce
I long for you, my dear
I search for your fragrance
in the atmosphere
Take care
Don't drop the baby
I won't talk to you
Muruga...Muruga...lyappa
Why won't you talk?
What wrong did he do?
Wasn't March 21 st your birthday?
But he wasn't with us
Let us not talk to him
We won't talk to you
Why are you crying like a baby?
Not me...baby is crying
Hush! Don't cry
- Baby! Whose baby is this?
- Bhanu and me
What is her name?
Sita...Rama...jungle...cuckoo
Don't name her
Everyone will call her by that name!
Nila
Her name is Nila
This is Nila
Daddy
Look up...mummy
She is refusing to eat
Tell her, Bhanu
Did you call for me?
I got a complaint
For every kilo there is a shortage of
But it was fine when we loaded the stuff
Does that mean you sold them on the way?
I swear on my wife
You can go
Not you
Why do you always swear on your wife?
Why don't you swear on yourself?
you are sacked
- What is the weight of this?
- 2 kgs
- When you load them?
- Same
- When you deliver them?
- Same 2 kgs
Then how can 50gms be less
when the load reaches the shops?
Must have melted in this Ooty weather!
Come and sit in front
I am sure you are the culprit
You claimed it thawed in the Ooty sunlight
If our boss gets to know this...
Yeah, you let go of what you should be
concentrating on and suspect me!
What did I miss?
They pack the chocolates
I load it in the van
You drive the van
Van leaves the factory
- That's all
- Then what?
Baby will cry!
What's up?
Where are you walking off to?
They pack the chocolates
You load it in the van and I drive it
Van leaves the factory
- Then what?
- Baby will cry
That's what I plan to check
After the van leaves the factory
you said the baby will cry
Why didn't she cry?
You came back, that's why she won't cry
Watch the baby cry now
Why is she gurgling?
Why don't you park to the side?
What are you doing here?
What's he saying now?
No, let me not repeat it
You'll feel sad
Don't call me names in your language
- Wait
- What?
Tangludu!#! @#&**:>\dhaydurr!!!
What did you say?
You didn't understand, right?
You get mad likewise!
Where are Murthy and Murugan?
I said it for your good
It's your call
Give me a straight answer
I'm here, sir
Why won't the chocolates be missing
if the truck is left unattended?
Did Murthy and Murugan come here?
No
Let me know when they come
What room is this?
Oven?
Victor has been looking for you
I'll let him know you are here
Wait here
Victor, do you know where Murthy is?
- You didn't see me
- No, but I saw you now
Tell Victor you didn't see me
it's wrong to lie
it's alright if it's for a good cause
- it's wrong to lie
- Don't keep muttering the same dialog
Be clear and loud
it's wrong to lie
Where did you go?
Baby has stopped crying
You are such an idiot
How can you suspect our Krishna?
He is so naive
How could you suspect him?
Yesterday I got muddled
Do you think you can fool me, you thief?
- What's so funny?
- I feel sad for you
- Why do you feel sad for me?
- Leave it, bro!
Tell me
When 2 people are involved
isn't it enough if I knows what to do!?
Say 'daddy'
She called me 'daddy', Raji
Look at the way he is calling her Raji
so casually in front of you!
Stop obsessing
Are you all jobless?
Why are you sitting here
in this cold listening to him?
Go home and sleep
She called me 'daddy'
All babies only say 'ma' first
- But she did call me daddy!
- You are such a nitwit
Raji, it's getting late
Come, let's go home
- Dad
- Don't go
This is a dad's lullaby
Hearing her 'baby-talk'
Mother earth sparkled with greenery
Dad doubles as mom,
in this endearing phase
His doodles designed
a masterpiece of grace
Lovingly, he continues...all alone
Tear drops plead for a parasol
brimming in the eye-space
This is a father's lullaby
Listening to this child's voice
Mother earth painted new scenery
Drops of water bonded to be born as rain
Though rain did stop
trees drizzled again
Just a kid even if he's an adult by age
Still a chili
she takes her mother's image!
No other bliss can rival this happiness
l sense God only through her eyes
Worldly wisdom this
unconditional love defies
Tear drops urge for an umbrella
from the alcove of their eyes
Why is the tree so tall?
Because its dad is tall, that's why
Why is the crow so black?
Roaming all day, it gets tanned by the sun
Why is the elephant so big?
It has a HUGE appetite, that's why
Where is mummy?
She is with God
Doesn't God have His own mummy?
Victor says God likes to keep
good people by His side
We are not good?
Shall we return their ball?
Do you like this school?
Can I also play if I join this school?
Sure, you can play and study well
You'll be a doctor 1 day
Why should I become a doctor?
So that you can take care of your dad
Do you like this?
Krishna...this looks used
Someone's worn it and kept it here
You can't take all this
Which school?
If you don't know the school's name,
leave now
Give me the money
Take the money
Balance?
What about balance Rs 180?
Pay the balance and take this tomorrow
Spoiling my day
early in the morning
Give me money, bro
Fast...we need it
This is all I have
My share...my mother gave me
Krishna, here is my share
Is this enough?
Balance?
I have to give you
Keep the bag in front
Go in, dear!
Sit
Must not cry
What is your name?
Your name, please?
What happened?
Come down
Let's go
Let's go home
Krishna is here
Nila is here
What did he do?
Made dosas  so yummy
Krishna fed Nila
Full became Nila's tummy
Nila baby's tummy is happy?
When will I become a doctor, daddy?
Tomo...few days...no... many days later
Can I take care of you
only after I become a doctor?
Shall we play again?
Krishna is here
Let m e see
Nila, what are you drawing?
Why is your page blank?
Why don't you do your home work daily?
Her dad is mad
Complete your homework from tomorrow
Otherwise you won't be allowed
into the class...understood?
- Kishore, where's your drawing?
- He is not mad
- What's your name?
- Nila
- Which class?
- Lower kindergarten
Why are you here?
Are you a teacher?
Student?
If I don't finish my home work
Ramya miss will scold me
Your mom doesn't help you at home?
I don't have a mummy
- Where is she?
- With God
- Daddy?
- Daddy...
My dad heads not just this
but 18 schools in Tamil Nadu
We have a different approach to education
It isn't enough to be a teacher
You must be a parent too
Ramya, I shouldn't see any child
standing outside the class room
I can't get the signal here
I'll come out and talk
I can't hear you
- What's your name?
- Shweta
- What are you doing here?
- This is my room
Oh! You have a room?
What do you do?
Just like that
Won't Ramya miss yell at you
if you don't do any work?
She won't
If anyone scolds you, come and tell me
We are celebrating
We will conduct story telling and
poetry recitation competition
Correspondent has said
every child should participate!
- Correspondent means?
- She is a big teacher
Give me your names and contest names
What?
What's the matter?
I believe a big dinosaur
has come to school
- Dinosaur?
- One big Miss
- Not correspondent?
- Yes
We are supposed to tell rhymes and stories
Will you help me?
What do you want to be taught?
Story or rhyme?
Which one do you know?
Both
Then you can yourself tell big dinosaur
Who is big dinosaur?
Small dinosaur is Ramya miss
- Corres...
- Correspondent?
Correspondent is the big dinosaur
Children are waiting to be dropped
I'll drop Nila
Give the address to my driver
Nila didn't come
Nila didn't come
Go away
Stop!
Don't make me run behind you
I've run 4 kms in school and pedaled 8 kms
He's made me sweat even in this cold!
Where is his daughter?
She should have reached long ago
Correspondent said she would drop her
- Why didn't you say this earlier?
- I forgot
You dim-witted guy!
Where were you so long?
You could have given me the house key
Her teacher waited and just now left
Not teacher, Shweta
- Is she angry?
- Very much
Daddy, will you also leave me like mom?
I will never do that
You were the one who left me
Do you know where all I searched for you?
- Driver's house...school
- They didn't tell you?
I believe I must tell a story
That's why it got delayed
Story?
I'll tell you a story
But you should come back early
Do you know to tell a story?
- I know plenty of stories
- Tell me
I'll tell you tomorrow
But you shouldn't leave me
I feel terrible without you
If I am missing again
tell that Nila
That moon will tell me
What are you doing here
without loading the stuff into the van?
Nila has to tell a story in her school
So Krishna has been hassling everyone
- Who is the victim?
- You!
How?
I don't know any story to tell
You must tell
He is the root cause for all problems
- I really don't know
- I won't let you go
- Haven't you left for the shops?
- Haven't you?
Tell her to tell me a story
You want a story, right?
I'll tell you
- Do you know to tell a story?
- I do...come
Do you know to tell stories?
I know many stories
But Krishna cannot understand them
As long as either the story teller or listener
is expressive, isn't it enough?
Story
How long will you be this way?
Is this a story?
Won't you begin with
'in a far away land'?
Let us talk about your story
How long can you be single?
You are young and handsome
Fair complexioned
You have a good set of teeth!
Get married, so you and
Nila can be taken care of
How can he get married again?
Knowing his past story...
Nowadays which girl wants intelligence?
They'll be happy with someone like him
I'll find a suitable wife
to take care of you and Nila
But Raji is there to take care
Should I say it loud and clear?!!
Raji is there to take care
Krishna is here
I want to tell you a story
Story?
What story, daddy?
- Which one shall I say?
- Story...for what joy?
What if someone steals
your story and makes a movie?
Tell her the crow story
Which one shall I tell?
Tell the story of the King! King of Kings!
Tell her the story of Maestro Ilaiyaraja!
I'll tell you a royal story
In a far away land...
...there lived a king
- Did the king live all by himself?
- No, of course!
He had ministers
his yes-men 4
Side kicks??
In a land there lived an emperor!
As good as stooges,
were his ministers 4!
Once there was war in the country
In the war everyone fought
Once there was war in the country
In the war everyone fought
Amidst the fight; bombs blasted!
Dom! Dom! Dom!
But why fight?
Why did the battle begin?
Why did the battle even begin?
The crow stole a fritter...that's why
War happened suddenly
...because crow stole a fritter
with its beak
Cunning fox asked the crow
to sing Do Re Me...
Crow sang...really?
Oh! The crow can't sing!
Avvww...poor crow had nothing!
You think the king will let it go?
King started to sing off-key
Fox dropped the fritter hurriedly
Crow said Thanks, Your Majesty! '
Entire kingdom rejoiced happily
With his tail tucked in, the fox fled
'Long live our king', everyone said
Long live our king!
Long Live His Majesty!
Is this the story of the crow or king?
it's the story of the Crow-King!
Hail our Crow King! Hail our Crow King!
As a master story teller l think...l ponder
Amused, you appreciate
in big eyed wonder
I have more stories
to reel out from my mind
For you to hear..applaud...unwind
In a land there lived an emperor!
As good as stooges,
were his ministers 4!
Again King's story?
Oh! Not another King's story!
But this is a different king!
What did this king do?
His kingdom was troubled
by a dinosaur for long
So the people complained
to the king very strong
As Superman, to kill this dinosaur dead
their king should go, they requested
Anaconda terrifies the king
all the way through
After that...a tornado
storms on him too
Anaconda terrifies the king
all the way through
After that...a tornado
storms on him too
Sabre-toothed tiger roars
that's what happens next!
All the people exclaimed
'Long live Your Majesty'!
Why was the tiger killed?
Shouldn't the dinosaur die?
All the people exclaimed
'Long live Your Majesty'!
Okay daddy...I've heard enough
I tell you tales
all through the night
You analyze-paralyze
wrong and right
I have more stories up my sleeve
for you to listen, laugh, believe!!!
Once upon a time there was a Highness
listening to this story
Nila sleeps in happiness
I am going to sleep now
Has Nila slept?
All my stories I repeat
sleepily you listen to this dreamy treat
My story has a sequel
Just for you
audio visual so special
- Go and bring him
- Who are you?
Let me go
When is it Nila 's turn?
- Should I tell both rhymes?
- Just 1 will do
After No moon I believe
Do you remember everything?
- Should I tell both rhymes?
- Just 1 will do
You didn't seem to miss me
That's why
- You didn't even tell me?
- We are engaged
Do I need permission to see you?
Let's see
She'll come
Do you want to see Nila?
Come, let's go
They just now left
How will they come back so soon?!
Daddy!
Come on, tell
Do you know the rhyme?
You go on to the stage
We adults have a lot to learn
from these children
Nila and Arun share the first prize
They are calling Nila to take the prize
We invite our correspondent
Shweta to give the prize
Ma'am, please come to the stage
Krishna should be the one to be thanked
He has brought up his daughter
as innocent as him
Can we leave?
Shall we go, Krishna?
Who is with Nila?
Let's leave after a while
Nila's dad, Krishna
Her mom?
Bhanu is her name
Where is she?
She died very young
What are you saying?
Good or bad, she should have
married someone with sense
He killed her through sheer neglect!
Now this kid is stuck with him
like a garland in a monkey's hand!
Wonder when he will kill this child?
No one can eat or sleep
in peace thanks to him
What are you saying?!!
I am well aware of the facts
Will you be okay if I drag a girl by her hand
and coochey coo her child all the time?
Are you coming now or not?
What happened?
That Nila is...
Shall we see Shweta before we leave?
Let's go
it's Krishna, dad
I have seen him in snaps before
Where are you?
Will you wait here?
I'll go inside
I'll never call you dinosaur again
Come Nila, let's go home
Nila won't come
You can leave
- Why won't she come?
- She won't
Daddy
- Nila, let's go home
- Dadddddy!
Nila won't come
Get lost
Daddy!
Catch him
I'm going home
- Give me the child
- No
Let me go home
Grab him
Give me the child
Let go of Krishna
Give me the child
What's happening here?
Are you all uncivilized?
Behave like humane beings!
Bhanu is my daughter
I have searched for her everywhere
I thought she'd be living happily
with the man she loved...somewhere
They acted in haste
I apologize on their behalf
Krishna and Nila are all that
I have left in my daughter's memory
Send them with me
I'll take care of them both
Don't give him money
This is Krishna's money
He earned it rightfully
How can I ever thank you
for all that you've done?
You are not taking with you
just 1 child but 2
Stop the car
Get down
We've reached...get down
I'll hold her for you
Start the car
Only medicine for Krishna is Nila
What are you doing?
Nila will come
Trust me
I'll take Krishna back with me
Admit him in a hospital there
incidentally or accidentally I am also
to blame for Krishna's present condition
Re-uniting Krishna and Nila
is my responsibility
I'll take care
Stop here
My client
He'll be here till my case gets over
Is this a home or charity hall?
Charity hall
Rajendran, chairman of
Green valley educational trust
Not just in Ooty, he has
Well known in our society

Youngest daughter Shweta

Fax this immediately
I need to talk to you personally
I'm seeing you for the 1st time now
How can we share anything personal?
Who?
- Which Bhanu?
- Your eldest daughter
I have just 1 daughter called Shweta
Why are you lying?
There's no necessity for me to lie
Look at me and speak
Nila is with you
There's no one by the name Nila here
Where is Nila?
She's up...go
Where are you going?
- Stop, you shouldn't go there
- Nila is there, let me go see her
Who is this?
Stop there
Nila is up
I want my Nila
Take your hands off
- Get out from here
- I want my Nila
Don't you dare hit him
Take us to Nila
I am being nice to you
because you are a female
I want Nila
Are you deliberately
making trouble for me?
You separated a daughter and dad,
...left him on the roads
and now claim innocence?
Who are you to question me?
How are you connected to him?
I am a lawyer
Krishna is innocent
Then file a case in the court
Don't create a ruckus here
What did you do?
Habeas corpus
Writ petition
They have to bring Nila
to the court wherever she may be
Do you know whom
we are crossing swords with?
Can we compete with his money
or man power?
No, we can't
That's why
- Can we meet Mr Rajendran?
- Please take a seat
What are you doing here?
When will my daddy come?
You know he's not well
As soon as he gets better he'll be here
When will he get better?
When will he come?
Tomorrow
This is your reply everyday
When will he really come?
Tomorrow
Positively
Sir, someone has come to see you
This is an order from the High court
We came in person since it concerns YOU!
If you let us know how to handle this
Why are you here?
Do you need a lawyer?
I am sorry I cannot oblige
Withdraw the case you are handling now
Why? What happened?
You were prepared to meet me in the court
We'll meet there just as you said
There's no justice
in the case that you are handling
What's justice?
You broke a lovely home
Is that fair?
You separated a dad and his daughter?
Is that right?
Do you know the anguish of that affection?
You are asking me about affection?
No one can feel that pain more than me
My eldest daughter
never wanted to get married
Social service was her life
When she told me she loved someone
instead of objecting
like most dads would do...
I was the one who with great joy
told her to bring him home
But she brought home a man like him!
No dad in the world would agree
She chose him over my money,
dignity, status, love
Where is she today?
Do you want me to lose Nila too?
You are talking about 1 whose life is over
I am talking of those who are still alive
- Whomever...
- We'll discuss the rest in court
I did not come here
fearing you or this case
Your case won't hold water
even in Supreme court!
This case is not a cake walk, like you think
Law does not support a mentally unstable
parent to bring up his or her child
- I am aware
- Then why do you want to take up this case?
Neither will we win nor get money
On top of it, habeas corpus
I've promised Krishna
I'd get Nila back for him
I don't know if I'll succeed
At least I should make them meet
Krishna is here
If you tell me where Nila is,
I'll go find her
What are you doing?
I'm talking to my daddy
Nila said if I talk to this Nila
it will be our messenger
- Did you eat?
- No
Come, let's eat
When will Nila come?
When will my daddy come?
Tomorrow you can see Nila during the day
What's the time?
As if you'll understand!
Nila will come
I want to see Nila
Even Neil Armstrong who went
to the moon wouldn't be so obsessed!
You've been bugging me from last night
Wait, she'll come
What's in the basket?
For Nila
Food, biscuit and sweater
Sweater for her too?
Mr Bashyam?!
He can make even a normal guy loony!
Where's the child?
It isn't necessary to bring
the child as she is a minor
What do we do now?
You escort Krishna out
Come with me
Who is this new kiddo?
I have never seen her before
She used to be a spectator
Now she's a lawyer!
Inspite of habeas corpus
Nila has not been brought to court
This is a disgrace to our law and justice
A pip squeak 2 cases old is questioning
my 20 years experience, My Lord!
If it is so funny why should
they be scared to bring the child?
Mr Bashyam, why hasn't
the child been brought to court?
My client Mr Rajendran
is the child's legal guardian
According to section #7
I submit this petition
When the child's biological father is alive,
how can someone else be her legal guardian?
It's true her father exists
But in what state?
What's wrong with him?
He is fine
The child's father is mentally retarded
Who told you that?
Who needs to tell?
Have you seen him?
Do you have any proof?
He not only disrespects the court
but also my petitioner
My petitioner Mr Krishna
is just like one of us
He runs a chocolate factory in Ooty
I object strongly to my client
being falsely accused
Not sufficient if you grow tall enough
to hit your head in the front porch!
The way you piled on objections
I almost got a heart attack
Think back to the times we waited endlessly
to apprentice as Bashyam's junior?
Like Vino said, he'll make
a normal person go nuts!
If they see Krishna
our case goes for a toss!
- Will Nila come there?
- This is enough!
It wasn't deliberately said
That's what I could think of
at that spur of the moment
You could have asked for an adjournment
claiming your tummy was cart wheeling!
You've stated the impossible
Shall we get a certificate
from the doctor that Anu is unstable?!
I can't think of any other
There's a way if you are willing
You sent a message to him from her number?
With a kiss emoticon
I've been waiting
from our college days for this
My job's gone
Anu told me not to work with her
I've been warning you
from college days not to befriend her
She's as useless as a pumpkin
Come with me right now
I'll ask Bashyam to take you as his junior
I have a lot of clout there
Mr Bashyam doesn't even know his name
Snooty scoundrel
Let me plaster his face with sand
What happened?
I can't leave Anu
Why?
She hasn't paid me for 5 months
Unless we win Nila's case
I won't get my salary
it's my responsibility to help you
We will win
if Krishna is mentally challenged
as you claim...
...they can't go beyond the 1st hearing
I don't claim
It is a fact
it's tough to convert truth into a lie
it's easy to make truth out of truth
Where's Krishna?
Am I the watchman of this house
to check who is in and who is out?
Is anyone asking me permission to live here?
I told you, he'd be here
What are you doing here?
Isn't Nila here?
Case is still not over
If anyone sees you here now
you will never get Nila
I shouldn't come here?
Do you want Nila or not?
You cannot come here without my knowledge
I won't come here after
Won't just 'on the way' do?
Why add a suffix 'dear'?
I can't stand him
What happened?
So long to remove a sweater?
I've been trying for past
He's holding on to it like
it's an appendage to his body!
Only his brain is weak
Rest of his body is strong as an ox
I am such a lion king
I couldn't accomplish it
Go man
lama lion king
- My name is Kris
- Don't lift your hand
My name is Krishna,Avalanchi, Ooty
Repeat that
You think you are a composer
conducting a concert?
So much fuss to pronounce
such a simple name as Krishna!
This is our first test
If we convince the examining doctor
rest of it is a cake walk
You are way too optimistic!
A normal man should have an IQ above 90
Anything less than that
is considered mentally challenged
So Krishna should get
Can't you give us the questions before hand?
Tomorrow's certificate?
We should never lie to a doctor or a lawyer
But a doctor or lawyer can lie!
Who is the person?
He is seated over there
Give me 5 minutes time
I'll get organized and then call you
Go and get his details
Tell me your details
Who is the one who came now?
Dr Basheer who will conduct the IQ test now
What about Dr Ramana Rao?
He's flat after drinking
some liquor doled out last night
Today he is attending all cases
What can I do?
You arranged everything
You have to set right this mess
Serves me right to have helped you!
Find someone else
Can we bribe the new doc?
- That's the hassle
- Why?
He cannot be tempted
He is very straight forward
Any other...
He loves his wife dearly
Just like us!
Then you have to surrender
Who are you?
- Mr Bashyam's junior
- He sent me
What are you doing?
Mr Bashyam asked me to give you
Give what? What's the matter?
Krishna, a patient will have his IQ tested
You should certify him as mentally challenged
with IQ level below 50
That's why I was sent
You think you can buy me with your money?
Do you know who I am?
Whom do you think you are talking to?
Hey! Who let him in?
How dare he pretend to be righteous?
If my boss gets to know this...
This is Mr Bashyam's case
Don't get stressed out
If you don't oblige you'll be in a soup
Are you working for the Government or them?
I'll bash you!
Will you give me the certificate
or shall I write it myself?
- I dare you to do it
- Will you meet Mr Bashyam?
Who the hell is Bashyam?
Get up
I am not a puppet on a string
for Bashyam to play with?!
Learned advocate has fraudulently
submitted a forged document
It is ridiculous that...
...a lawyer with 20 years of experience
claims a govt. document to be forged
If that be the case,
last year on February 7th
...he produced a document
in the divorce case of Kumar and Sandhya
It proclaimed Sandhya to be mentally ill
Is that a fake document?
In 2008, he proclaimed
Arul Murthy as mentally ill
in a drunken driving case,
involving 4 people
Is that a forged document?
This is the proof
Oh! She beat her teacher hollow!
This is the twist in our tale!
If he agrees to have
those cases take an IQ test
I'll agree to have my client tested
Her document can be accepted
My petitioner is a good father
He has brought up Nila
for 5 years with tender loving care
He is traumatized now
I humbly request this
IQ report be considered
as enough evidence
to unite Nila and Krishna
Since the case is still in court,
either in a common place
or court premises
I allow Krishna to meet
his daughter on Friday for an hour
If Nila comes to court
it will be a big fiasco
It will not be an obstacle for us
It will be a debacle for them
As long as Krishna is hidden they win
If Krishna comes to court they lose
Their reunion is advantageous to us
What if Nila meets Krishna?
Nila will come to court
But she won't meet Krishna
Krishna has to face me and this world
What are you doing?
Nila loves rice mixed with milk
Nila is really blessed
to get a dad like you
I am a good dad?!
What's happening?
Mr Bashyam is here
They have come with the child
Waiting to meet Krishna
I'll be there
- How much longer?
- We'll be there soon
Looks like an accident
Let me go check
How recklessly you drove!
It's Mr Bashyam's men
who are creating the traffic jam
I'll bring Krishna
- Come
- Come
No, this side
We are going to see Nila
- Do you want any food?
- I don't want
- Call Anu, quick
- Muruga, look over there
Anu, bring Krishna to the car park
without Mr Bashyam's knowledge
I am Murugan speaking
Krishna and his lawyer are coming
to the car park to see Nila
Her assistant is here
We have 2 more minutes
Come soon
it's getting late
Nila will leave
What are you doing?
Let's go
They are heading towards
the car park to see Nila
Relax! I'll take care
Escort him to the car park
Anu, why are you so late?
- Where's Nila?
- They just took her this way
Where have they gone?
- Where is Mr Bashyam?
- As per our plan, Krishna...
- Where are they?
- They were here just now
Krishna is at the rear entrance
You came to relieve yourself
But didn't go in
Yeah! I came to relieve myself
But it can wait
I didn't intend to
But I can't hold on for long
Mr Bashyam?
I am Murthy, Avalanchi
- We spoke over the phone
- Tell me
As per your request
I've brought Krishna's friends
They are all as loony as him
If you take them to court,
you'll come thumbs up!
Judge will finish this case
in favoring a jiffy!
Be ready at 9:00 A.NI tomorrow
I'll send a car
For no reason should anyone
step out of the room
That Bashyam has an extra
long nose and brain
I knew he'd do something crooked like this
We should somehow
convince Murthy before day break
Can we call the hotel
and find out the room #?
Room may not be booked in their names
Do you expect us to knock on all doors!?!
Just 1 clue
All floors are occupied by tennis players
Others have been allotted rooms
only in the 4th floor
So we need to check only the 4th floor
Whoever recognizes Krishna
and vice versa they are 'them'!
- 'They' are who?
- 'Them'!
What do you want?
Why do you keep repeating?
Why are you hassled hearing it just twice?
We've heard it 2000 times! Be patient
When the next door opens
just check if your friends are in
Don't ask for Nila
Who the hell are you?
Why do you knock
at such an unearthly hour?
What are you gaping at?
Didn't you knock at my door?
Then, who did?
Not Anu, he did
Didn't you knock?
He's asking for you
Why did you disturb me
at this time of night for?
- Moon
- What?
Little...
Is that so?
That's why...let him go...poor guy
Take good care of him
You should not mention Nila's name
Anu, tell him
What's happening here?
- I didn't know how to tackle that guy
- Let's ask this waiter
Don't be stupid
What if it boomerangs on us?
Mr Sweater won't tell,
we don't know the room
I shouldn't ask the waiter,
you'll call me a nut-case
Do you think I can be used and thrown?
Search all you want without me
We don't need Vino
Let's go
Is it an IPL cricket match for me
to give a constant update?
We have to hunt for loonies
Very soon I'll go mad
Sit down
Something is fishy
Let's leave
Bashyam has kept them hidden somewhere
If only I catch them I'll squeeze them dry
Wrong place to talk over the phone
Giant robots are besieging me
Where are these 2?
Did you see 2 people kind-of-loony?
Not that side
Where did they go?
Why were you standing in the corridor
if you came to see a guest?
Not me...she...
We forgot the room #
You could have enquired at the reception
We came to see him
He's gone
Did you see a slightly loony guy
walking this way with a lady?
Stop hassling me!
Did you see a slightly loony guy
walking this way?
God knows where they have gone!
Looks like our Murthy
Why are you here?
Where are the other 2?
Pink cotton candy
Murthy, Big eye Jo, Karthi
Where are you?
How long will I hunt for you?
Murthy's going up
There's no one by the name Murthy here
What were you doing in the corridor?
Tell me the truth
UP
Down
He's in the lift
He's in the 4th floor
Checked shirt
Buck teeth
- He's Murthy
- He's going into the room
He's gone into the room
He has shut the door
Where did you all go?
Where are the other 2?
There are 2 people here
claiming to be your guests
- Yes...yes, sir
- Your guests?
They are my guests
They are of unsound mind
Keep them with you
Don't open the door whoever knocks
Turn right
Checked shirt
Buck teeth
He's forecasting a weather report
for a rain that won't shower!
You said they won't come
Who is that?
- I told him
- Whom did you tell?
Murthy, let them tell
only what they have been tutored
Damn! This JCB toothed guy is Murthy
Not that shovel mouthed smarty!
What do we do now?
Do you know Krishna?
Oh yeah! Krishna is my friend
We...Nila...foot ball ground
...we bought pink colored shoes for her
The whole truth and nothing but the truth
After nodding his head
like a buffalo he's tongue-tied now
The whole truth...
Truth? Why?
What's this book?
Give the book back to me
I can't swear, go away
- I swear...
- I swear
I swear
All these witnesses are Krishna's friends
From 1986 to 2005 they were together
in Kotagiri institute for mental health
Required evidence
for that is on page #13
What other evidence is needed
to confirm Krishna's mental instability?
Those who befriend mentally challenged people
need not themselves be mentally unstable!
Our learned counsel is unaware that evidence
by these witnesses is null and void
It surprises me
Will you accept evidence
by my witness who is of sound mind?
He is a friend of these
mentally challenged witnesses
I swear the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
Is Krishna your employer?
Krishna is a helper
Our manager is Victor
Describe Krishna
Krishna is like a child
- Which means?
- A little...
- Of unsound mind
- Yes
- Wow! Bashyam is amazing!
- Curtain fall for all
- Do you know Bhanumathi?
- Very well
Poor girl! She married this Krishna
Died prematurely in child birth
For God's sake don't give custody
of the child to Krishna
Nila's life will also be an unholy mess!
Mr Murthy, you can leave now
How can you so flippantly ask me to go?
Mr Bashyam has spent
so much to bring us here
How can I go without a word to him?
He taught me word by word what to say
I hope I did full justice!
Wow! Bashyam is like Pandora's box!
He made even normal people act abnormal!
I hope I didn't forget any important dialog!
I don't understand
Leave this place right now
He has given me permission to go
Life is a battle field
with its struggle and suffering
An anthem let us unite to sing
Wearied feet may weep in misery
Unslept eyes may eclipse unwillingly
Though it is dark and dreary
let us fight
Just round the next bend
sun will radiate its light
Dream will come true definitely
Are you pushing the child?
Who are you?
Get out
Why are you standing here?
Get out
Where is the watchman?
What are you doing in this play ground?
Stop it!
Are you a genius?
Most of you will fail the IQ test
Shall I tell what's going on, in your homes?
Don't make me wash
your dirty linen in public!
Don't we have a life of our own?
Is Nila going to stay with us?
Then...?
After we are married, you'll be with me
Why are you obsessed with Nila?
Won't she be with us?
Your dad will take care of her
Or else there are plenty of 'homes'
I'll take care of the expenses
My sister was more of a mother to me
than my own mom...for her child...
I'm not sure if you will be in my life
but there's no life for me without Nila
There is no path on earth
that we cannot follow
Rivers don't stop to flow
fearing cavities hollow
There is not a single day
when the sun does not smile in the sky
A heart can never sink
with the downpour from the eye!
House of God has a holy faade
with idol inside
More sacred are golden hearts
where He will surely reside
You are the epitome of motherhood
of tender loving care
Truest heart, no one can compare
Wearied feet may weep in misery
Unslept eyes may eclipse unwillingly
Though it is dark and dreary
let us fight
Just round the next bend
sun will radiate its light
Dream will come true definitely
Krishna is of sound mind
But why is he not coming here?
It's not essential that petitioner
has to attend when it's a civil proceeding
He should be here when the defense
lawyer needs to cross examine him
At the same time you should know
what the child's preference is
Nila should also be here
- To bring a child to court is...
- Produce the child in court
We are all here
They might have had a narrow escape so far
Everyone backing him up must
answer my questions...not just Krishna!!
What we achieved so far is no big deal
Tomorrow is the D'day for us!
If they ever find out we lied
we'll be minus our lawyer robes!
Even we can't face
Mr Bashyam's cross examination
Imagine Krishna's plight
I don't think it's a good idea
to show Krishna in court tomorrow
I know
Daddy
Thunder...scared
I see a colored curve in your eyes
...that flirts with my eye lids new
What report is it weather-wise?
Hand in hand a sun and rain view
Within you...l see
I perceive
my love...my mother in you!
I taste defeat, dear
I lose...in toto
Whatever will happen here?
I am in a trance...sheer novelty
To my soul... you zoomed in as a mirror
You introduced myself to me
To my dreams...my sole answer
In your eyes I see a rainbow
that touches my eye lids aglow
What is this new climate?
Sun as rain's soul mate!
You breezed into my life out of the blue
Head to toe you bloomed in me anew
Maybe tomorrow you may part from me
You'll be a part of my memory
Don't you see...street gets lonely
after the chariot passes by
You baited me with your charm
I fell hook line and sinker!
Finally now because of you
l realize my femininity
I falter..waven..flutten..linger
My heart doesn't listen to me any longer
It criss-crosses into your path, my dear
Don't worry...just a sprain
I've applied this ointment
She'll be fine tomorrow
Please go sleep
Don't get worked up
Go to bed
I want to see my daddy
But your dad is not well
Why are you lying to me?
My daddy is here
Aren't we here for you?
Don't you like me?
You are with your dad
Can't I be with mine?
You called for me?
I was wondering
how my framework got rattled
Now I know
fault lies in the basement!
Did I give you questions
to cross examine me?
I wanted to single out the white sheep
from the flock of black sheep
This is your phone statement
When I gave you the questions
it was 4:00 P.M
You've called Priya promptly at 4:05 P.M
and showed your sincerity!
What's the plan?
Krishna will not come to court tomorrow
Krishna has been kidnapped
By whom?
You, sir
That's what we intend telling in the court
So long you took a salary from me
but you were on their side
Today you will be on my side!
This is constable Ranga's house
Come out
Let's go see Nila
In my 20 years of experience
how many cases I've witnessed
This is the 1st time I have wanted
to see the petitioner face to face
I want Nila
I want to see her
Say this tomorrow in court
I'll show your true colors
I had closed all doors
I don't know how Krishna went out
Where could he have gone?
He must have gone to see Nila
Krishna knows only this place
If he isn't even here...?
How are you here?
What are you doing here?
I'm going
Stop...catch him
Watchman...stop him
Catch him
Did you pretend to bring him here?
Now you've helped him escape?
Don't make me lose face again!
I swear I am not part of this plan
He escaped of his own accord
He cannot think independently
You are the culprit
Please believe me
I am not part of this plan
If he isn't back in an hour here...
What happened, deal?
Where the hell is she?
Don't worry, kiddo
Stop for a minute
Where did you go?
Your phone is switched off
Krishna is missing!
My mom is sick
I have to go now
I must go
Okay, I'll take care
You leave
Janaki, his temperature is 103F
How could you be so careless?
It's not enough
to just give birth to a child
Charity begins at home!
Social service should take a back seat
What's happened?
Now you ask me
This is what will happen if you are a dad
when you should be a grand dad!
Where are you going?
He's back, sir
Get this medicine
- Where did you find him?
- He himself came back, sir
Paracetamol for fever
Tixylix for cough
This is what I just prescribed
Who is this newcomer?
Bashyam, you have an in-house doctor
Don't change doctors
just because I reprimanded you
Give this medicine after food
for the next 5 days, he'll be fine
Good people face maximum hurdles
But they come out winners
We are ready with all that you wanted
Anything else?
Your child...fever
Medicine...thrice a day...after food
Let's submit the petition after the hearing
He won't go anywhere
Tell her
Traitor
My Lord! I request your permission
to cross examine the petitioner Krishna
What is your name?
My name is Krishna
Are you unwell?
Any other problem?
Look at m e
Then why were you
in a mental institution from 1986 to 2005?
My mother told me she was not well
Your mother was unwell, or you?
Your father?
My father went away to be with God
There is no connection
between this case and these questions
There is a link, My Lord
The reasons for his stay in a mental institute
...are not his mother's ill health
or father's demise
When he was 3, they found out
he was mentally challenged
They admitted him in that institute
I've produced evidence already in court
Who is Nila?
My daughter
How old is she?
What is she doing?
She goes to school
Which school?
If you can't even pronounce
her school's name
...how will you take care of Nila?
I'll be a good dad
How can you take care?
Nila will soon be 10
then 15 years, she'll attain puberty
She'll be 10 years older than you mentally
What will you do then?
- I will...
- You will...
- Nila...
- Nila...?
Nila is 5 now
When she is 6 years old, how can he,
sharing the same age take care of Nila?
Under the guise of questioning
learned counsel is threatening my client
I'll take care of Nila
I want Nila
Can you educate Nila the way she aspires?
Can you make her dreams come true?
You can't understand
Can you?
What will Nila be, if she is with you?
How will you make her a doctor?
You can't even remember her school's name
You needed help to get admission for her
What kind of future can you assure Nila?
I'll educate her
How will you make her a doctor?
Can you help her with her assignments?
Can you teach her Arithmetic?
Can you clear her doubts in Science?
- Do you know to teach her History?
- Tell him
When she's grown up can you
behave normally in society like her?
I want Nila
Do you want Nila to suffer
like how Bhanumathy did?
Forget making her a doctor
Can you make Nila a nurse?
I want Nila
If Nila is with you,
you can't take care of her
She has to take care of you!
My client Mr Rajendran
is the child's legal guardian
According to the guardian and wards act
Habeus corpus petition
was filed in this court
That is to bring Nila here
regarding her illegal custody
Nila is with her grand father
respondent Rajendran
Where did you go?
This habeus corpus was a ploy
to distract the court's attention...
...and try rejecting the move
to make Rajendran her legal guardian
For this sole reason this petition
should be dismissed
Instead of appealing to a higher authority
and wasting valuable time
So My Lord, Nila to grow up with Krishna
I have no objections
Neither you nor I am the winner
It is Krishna's unconditional love
For the 1st time I am glad I lost
- It doesn't matter
- I had no other go
Krishna is here
Nila is here
She loves her daddy tonnes and gallons
Tell her I am not well if she asks
She will ask
When she wakes up at 7:00 A.NI
she drinks a huge glass of milk
She doesn't like food that's too spicy
What have you done?
If Nila is with you,
you can't take care of her
She has to take care of you!
Nila should have all the comforts
I can't...
They can...
Nila will one day be a famous doctor
Nila will shine
