Here's what you missed
on Glee: Regionals is coming up
and Jessie's left the glee
club, and though it seems like
I think I kind of like her.
I don't want her to get hurt.
Quinn's preggo and feels like
she's totally alone.
And Sue won't leave Will alone
as the poor guy's trying
to get over divorcing
his terrible wife, Terri.
She's just kind of...
you know, terrible.
Sorry.
And that's what you missed on Glee.
{bell ringing}
MERCEDES: Is it just me,
or does it feel like
we have a real shot at
Regionals next month?
The Ohio Show Choir chat rooms
have all been buzzing
about how Vocal Adrenaline
has lost a step.
I agree-- the judges know
all of their tricks
and now that we have Jessie,
they've lost
their best performer.
You guys have to come to the
auditorium-- it's an emergency!
{bell ringing}
Jessie?
What are you doing
up there with them?
I've transferred back
to Carmel High, Rachel.
I'm sorry that
it's come to this,
but you guys were awful to me.
You never accepted me,
you never listened
to my clearly superior ideas.
Why are you here
in our auditorium?
The blogs and the chat rooms
say that we're finished,
and that you guys are ripe
to topple us.
We just wanted to show you
a something we came up with
a few days ago
to see if you agree
with that assessment.

Thanks for letting us

It's quaint.
{laughing}
{sighs}
{bell ringing}
ARTIE:
It's a Carmel High tradition.
They psych out the competition
a few weeks before the big show.
They call it a funkification.
Meaning they show us
what they've got,
and we spiral
into a deep black funk.
Yeah. Yeah, we used to do
the same thing
to other football teams.
You know, try and get inside
their head before a big game,
pull little pranks
to intimidate them.
Yeah, well, the difference was
our football team sucked.
Those guys are golden.
KURT: Come on, keep
your heads up, guys.
It's going to take
more than that
to get us into a funk.
TINA:
I feel so violated.
It's like someone
broke into our home.
Look, it was just
a lame little prank.
And the fact that they're
trying to get to us
means maybe we
got them spooked.
Uh-uh, Mr. Shue.
They aren't afraid of anything.
That number they did
was fantastic.
You know, which doesn't
make any sense.
They had all that equipment.
How did they even get in?
I gave 'em all keys.
Helped them do a sound check
over the weekend.
Hey, this way, fellas.
Let's punch out this wall here.
That'll open up the space a little bit.
Sue, what are you doing?
I can't talk to you now,
William.
Drafting class is helping me
redecorate around here.
You see, I have Nationals
over the weekend,
and I expect to return
with a comically large
first place trophy for which
I have absolutely no room
in my trophy case.
As soon as you hurry up
and lose at Regionals,
this choir room will become
my official trophy annex.
You know what it
has to look like?
Elvis' gold record
room at Graceland.
Except I'll be wanting
far fewer morbidly obese
white women waddling
around and crying.
Sue, get out of my room.
Glee Clubbers, for you those
of you whose hearing
has not been damaged by massive
doses of Acutane, listen up.
In a few weeks,
Glee Club will be finished.
Now how do I know that?
Well, I recently checked
the odds with my Vegas bookie,
who told me that you're 40-1
underdogs at Regionals.
You are going to lose,
and your dreams
will be crushed.
Sue, can I see your trophy?
Sure, Will.
Hope and dream.
You dropped your trophy, Sue.
You know, for me,
trophies are like herpes.
You can try to get rid of them,
but they just keep coming.
You know why?
Sue Sylvester has hourly
flare-ups of burning, itchy,
highly contagious talent.
Enjoy your last few days here.
This room is mine.
{bell ringing}
So you sign here,
and here.
And you sign here and here.
{pens clicking}
{pens scribbling}
{clearing throat}
Well...
By the power vested in me
by the bar association
of the great State of Ohio,
I know pronounce you
no longer husband and wife.
Mazel tov.
{door closing}
You're still that
You always will be.
{door closing}
{bell ringing}
All right, guys, today I want
to talk to you about regrets.
Who has some?
Giving my heart to Jessie,
just to have it crushed
like the stage floor
at a performance of Stomp.
Thinking "trust me" was
a sensible birth control option.
We all have them.
I just finalized my divorce.
I regret
living in a relationship
that wasn't working.
Letting her put me
in these deep funks
and not fighting back.
Besides creeping us out,
why are you telling us this?
Because if we lose to
Vocal Adrenaline at Regionals,
none of us are
going to regret it.
We will have given
it our best shot
and we won't look back.
But we will regret letting them
get the best of us
before the competition.
Which is why we need to hit them
back just like they hit us.
So you want us
to TP their choir room?
Whatever the better,
cooler version of that is.
Like, uh, maybe-maybe we should
steal their school statue.
Their school statue
is a giant bronze of a great
white shark eating a seal pup.
It weighs three tons.
Okay, how about this one.
All right, we get like...
PUCK: Everyone knows this
is going to come down to me.
Revenge, fear, the merciless
infliction of pain.
First time I gave a wedgie
to a kid, I was four years old.
Finn and I may still hate
each other for some reason,
but we both know that defending
the honor of New Directions
{dog barking in distance}
{hissing}
Yeah, I did it.
And I'm proud. All I did
was step up and be a man.
They got what was coming
to them.
A few of my students
TP'd your choir room.
You slashed the tires
on the Range Rovers
of all 26 of my performers.
Those were gifts for
our win at Sectionals.
That's 200 times 26
times four equals...
I don't have a calculator.
I'm sorry, you bought
all your kids Range Rovers?
We have a very active
booster club.
Look, nobody got hurt.
It was a harmless prank.
SUE: That's what they said
about a young man in Chicago
in 1871, who thought he'd
play a harmless prank
on the dairy cow of
one Mrs. O'Leary.
He successfully
ignited its flatulence
and a city burned, William.
That young terrorist
went on to become
the first gay president
of the United States,
Abraham Lincoln.
Enough.
These students
have committed a felony.
They are hereby expelled.
Look, I don't want anyone
to get expelled.
I'm not going
to press charges...
as long as you pay
for the damage.
You can take it out
of the glee club budget.
That'll bankrupt the glee club.
We don't have that kind
of money.
We'll get jobs.
Give us a month.
We'll pay you back,
Ms. Corcoran, I promise.
Fine.
Ms. Corcoran, you are
as wise and magnanimous
as you are beautiful.
Thank you.
Well, you just can't
win, can you, William?
You never have,
and you never will.
Are you want to take a trip down that
rabbit hole, William?
I'm willing to try
anything, Sandy.
I'm just really depressed.
I don't sell to the
clinically depressed.
You'll throw yourself
off a parking garage
and I can't have that
on my conscience.
I used to coach that glee club.
I know what you're up against.
You think Carmel High didn't
put the fear of God in me?
I don't know how we
can possibly beat them.
Glee is hanging by a thread.
William, the answer is
right in front of your face,
but you can't see it
because you're in
too big of a funk.
Vocal Adrenaline
has a weakness.
{bell ringing}
Funk.
Use it in a sentence.
Come on.
Rachel.
This cheese smells funky.
That's because
it's "from-unda" cheese.
Shut it, Puckerman!
Okay, okay.
I was thinking more
along the lines of...
Vocal Adrenaline has sure
put us all in a funk.
I'm so depressed, I've worn
the same outfit twice this week.
What if I told you
I knew how we could shove it
right back down their throats?
New Directions is about
to make their funk the P-Funk.
We are going to get funked up.
The only way to do that
is to beat them at Regionals.
Vocal Adrenaline has never once
done a funk number.
They're a machine,
a collective, synthesized,
soulless beat.
Funk is soul meets anger.
Its passion is in its emotion.
And Vocal Adrenaline doesn't
perform with any.
So you have your assignment.
I want you guys
to turn McKinley High into...
¶¶Funky town! ¶¶
You guys can relax,
I got this one covered.
Cool.
Hold on a second.
I-I want a chance
to get funky, too.
{laughter}
{laughing}:
Good one, Quinn.
It even sounds funny
when you say it.
You said funk
was about soul and anger.
Look at me. Look at my life.
I'm furious!
MERCEDES:
Let's be honest.
When white people try
to be funky,
you end up with KC
and the Sunshine Band.
I love "Boogie Shoes."
Mercedes' racism aside,
I will have something prepared
tomorrow.
All right, Quinn goes first.
{bell ringing}
Rachel, can I see you
in my office?
You seem to be taking
this Jessie thing pretty hard.
I want him to be eaten
by a lion.
{sighs}
Jessie, cared about you.
No, he didn't.
Our entire relationship
was just some diabolical plan.
They knew if they broke my heart
close enough
to the competition,
that I'd lose my will to live,
and then New Directions
would have no chance
at winning Regionals.
It's textbook;
You destroy the heart
of the team's heart
and you destroy the team.
WILL: Sandy told me how to
beat Vocal Adrenaline,
and now Rachel was
inadvertently telling me
Suddenly, I wasn't feeling
nearly as depressed.
{playing tentative melody}
William, I'm gonna have
to ask you to clear out.
I received an anonymous
tip from someone
who wants to meet me here
to discuss
an illegal Hot Cheetos ring.
Hot Cheetos have been proven
to raise endorphins,
which makes for happy kids,
and I can't have that.
Yeah, no worries, Sue.
I'll just find
someplace else to...
Oh, wow.
What?
It-it's nothing.
It's just... it's just the way
the light hit you
just now, you looked stunning.
No, you're radiant.
Well, the week before Nationals
every year,
I have a placenta mask
right after a rigorous session
of microdermabrasion.
Well, whatever you're doing,
keep it up
because you have
never looked better.
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I should...
I got stuff to do, so...
Yeah, um...
Look, Sue, I gotta ask
your advice about something.
I know I make it seem
like I-I know what I'm doing,
but everyone knows
you're the kingmaker
around here.
I mean, you're this school's
arbiter of taste.
Continue.
We're doing this funk number
for Regionals,
and I wanted
to pick your brain about it.
I-I just wanted to know
if it's too suggestive.
And I only need
two minutes of your time.
Okay.
¶¶You ain't got no kind
of feeling insi-ide ¶¶
¶¶That will sure 'nuff set
your stuff on fire ¶¶
¶¶You refuse to put anything
before your pride ¶¶
¶¶What I got will knock
all your pride aside ¶¶
¶¶Tell me that you love me,
yeah ¶¶
¶¶"Got no time" is what
you're known to say-ay ¶¶
¶¶Oh, tell me, oh, tell me,
yeah-eah! ¶¶
¶¶Tell me that you love me,
yeah ¶¶
¶¶I like it, I like it,
yeah-eah ¶¶
{song ends}
So...
you feel anything there?
No.
Was I...
too dirty?
I didn't notice. I was bored.
Okay.
Right, left, and flip, okay?
Can I go shirtless
under this apron?
Look, I only hired
you two losers
because I'm desperate
to increase my quarterly sales
and you'll work for less
than immigrants.
As I'm you know,
Mr. Schuester and I
are now officially divorced.
I mean, I'm sure he talks
about it all the time.
Anyway, I'm on my own now.
And I need to make manager
by the end of the year
so that I can maintain
my lifestyle.
Terri, that guy who gave
me Bell's palsy is
back again today.
So...
help him.
He's our best customer.
You need to go help him.
But she just told you to do it.
I have got seniority
over you two losers,
which means you have to do
what I say.
Well, then I need
to kick your ass.
MAN:
Bamboo...!
You two... apron boys.
You're not gonna fondle us,
are you, Mr. Ryerson?
I've recently
redone my bathroom
as an homage
to Miss Jayne Mansfield.
Pink! It's all pink!
This is amaranth pink.
I need rose pink.
But this is all the pink
that we have.
Wrong answer.
Did they change the name of this
place to Losers N' Things?
Did everyone in
the whole world die so they had
to give these jobs
to you two morons?
And where's my Muzak?!
How am I supposed to shop
without my Kenny G?
{clapping hands} Let's go!
Crank it!

Go restack the space heaters.
Mrs. Schuester,
can you show me
how to fold this sham again?
Mrs. Schuester?
Oh. I'm sorry.
Yes, sure. Of course.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
Oh.
SUE:
Dear Journal,
Something strange happened
yesterday.
I felt something
below the neck.
I have feelings
for one Will Schuester.
Oh, it all makes sense now,
Journal.
True love always springs
from true hate.
I'll admit, in the past,
I've fantasized about waking up
with Will's head on the pillow
next to me,
attached to the rest
of his body.
{knocking}
Sue, you got a sec?
Yes, William.
How can I help you?
I, uh, I wanted
to bring you these.
I snuck a peek
at your tracksuit this morning,
and I got these to match.
Those are cheap
gas station flowers.
I-I have no interest.
Okay.
But I also got you these.
A tub of Extreme Challenge
Lifestyle CarboGels.
I had to drive to Dayton
to get your favorite flavor.
Appletini.
Appletini.
I don't get it either, Sue,
but you can't deny
that we have chemistry.
My divorce opened my eyes
to a world of possibilities.
I thought I'd finally
have the chance
to have all the things
I'd ever wanted.
And then I realized,
the only thing I want...
is Sue.
You have Nationals
this Saturday, right?
Why do you ask?
Because I'd like to take you
to dinner this week.
How's Wednesday night?
Breadstix?
Yeah.
Good.
Oh...
You know what Wednesday is,
right?
Hump day.
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Schuester,
my heart's not in this.
This whole Vocal Adrenaline
thing's really getting me down,
and we have to come up
with this funk number for Glee,
and I have like,
less-than-zero ideas, and I...
Glee?!
God!
This club is like toxic mold
on my life.
I'm sorry.
What am I doing?
This is exactly how
I destroyed my marriage.
I have this compulsive need to
crush other people's dreams.
Yeah, that's what Mr. Shue said.
I mean,
I think you're awesome, though.
I mean, look how hard
you've been working
to try and help me fold a sham.
Well...
And you'd be a total MILF
if it weren't for the whole
faking-the-mother thing.
You're very sweet.
You could be my second chance.
I'm gonna change.
I don't have to stay in
this post-divorce funk
forever, right?
Yeah. Yeah, right, I guess.
Well, then I am
going to help you
with your Glee assignment.
{chuckles}
Okay, you said you needed
a funk song, right?
Yeah.
Okay, so,
we'll type "funk"
into the iTunes,
and we'll see what comes up.
I never thought of that.
Oh, Howard, I'm promoting Finn
to assistant assistant manager.
You'll report to
him from now on.
Do you have a problem
with that?
{sighs}
Wow, thanks.
I believe in you, Finn.
{bell ringing} Okay, Quinn,
it's your day to show us
your funky side.
So, take it away.
For some of us...
...just simply getting to class
takes a little bit longer.
When you're pregnant,
you're responsible
for two lives.
And you're walking
down the hallway
oppressed by the man.
Oh, my goodness, she is
not about to go there.
Hearing people call you fat.
Sometimes it hurts.
Sometimes you have to stop
and hold that precious life
and say no.
This is offensive.
Who are these girls?
We're the "Unwed
Mothership Connection."
And that's what we're
here to sing about.

{song ends}
You're going to have
to order something.
My date will be here any minute.
Your date's not coming.
You got stood up.
{audience cheering on TV}
{pounding on door}
Right on time.
{rapid knocking}
How dare you?!
You led me on.
You told me you had
feelings for me,
then you ask me out,
you don't show up,
humiliating me.
In public.
Gosh, Sue, I wonder where
I learned how to do all that.
You meddled around
in my marriage,
you terrorize the glee club,
you continue to sabotage
my relationship with Emma.
I tried playing nice, but
nothing seems to work with you.
Cruelty was the only way
to get your attention.
I have no interest
in dating you, Sue.
You're a bully
and you're mean to kids.
I'm mean to everyone.
Yeah, well, fine.
Consider this a little taste
of what you love dishing out.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
This is uncalled for, William.
{sighs} Good night, Sue.
{mutters}
Santana, are you all right?
What...?
{sobbing}
Kurt, what is going on
around here?
Coach Sylvester
won't get out of bed.
We haven't had
practice in days.
I'm fine because I have Glee,
but these girls have
sort of lost it.
No Nationals means
that four of the girls
will lose their
college scholarships.
And the rest are just
depressed and confused.
Please, please,
love me, please.
It's really hard to feel
bad for Sue Sylvester--
she doesn't need
another trophy--
but some of these
girls, they really do.
FINN:
Mr. Shue,
Puck and I would like
to show the class
the true meaning of funk.
With a little help
from our special guest
Mercedes.
Whoo.
Yeah.
Fasten your seat belts, people.
It's going to be a funky ride.

{song ends, applause and whoops}
WILL:
All right.
Great job, guys,
but that's not funk.
I mean, the group is called
Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch,
but that is a rap song.
A kick-butt old school rap song.
ARTIE:
Does it really matter, Mr. Shue?
We're so clinically depressed,
we're doing the wrong songs.
We're in a deeper
funk than ever.
Mercedes,
I'm so sorry.
You may not be a minority,
but you certainly get
how it feels sometimes.
For nine months.
You've had to deal with this
your whole life.
People making assumptions,
calling you names.
I seriously can't understand
why don't feel like
yelling at people all the time.
What's the point
in getting angry?
Because it's infuriating.
I hate all the looks at school.
Don't even get me started
on Puck's mom.
You're not angry.
You're hurt.
You just need someplace safe
where you can dig through
all that rage.
Get to the pain beneath it.
So it's decided.
Saturday you move out
of Puck's house
and you move in with me.
I already talked
to my mom about it.
My brother went off to college
and we have an extra room.
Mercedes...
It's cool.
Us sisters got to stick
together, right?
{chuckles}
{both laughing softly}
{doorbell rings}
Mr. Schuester?
Yes.
Come in.
Thank you.
Um, is she doing okay?
Never seen her like this.
She won't leave her room,
and refuses her protein shakes.
Bad.
Very bad. Well, please, tell her
I'd love to speak with her.
Let me ask.
Thank you.
Careful.
That Regionals '85.
Very precious to Ms. Sue.
Sorry.
Mija, Mr. Schuester
is here.
SUE: Okay.
Okay.
She agreed to see you.
{knocking}
So have you come to gloat?
I, uh...
I hear you're pulling out
of Nationals, Sue.
You know, for some
of your girls
that's going to have
some really big consequences.
I'm tired of those kids.
I devoted my life to them.
And what have I got
to show for it?
Five consecutive
National championships.
Oh, big deal.
I'm alone, William.
I don't even like you
and I was willing
to jump at the chance
to be with you.
And, you know, for a second,
I saw a flash of something.
I pictured myself
living a normal life.
Having someone to come home to
every night.
And though
I completely loathe you,
you'd make
a great trophy husband.
And as you can see
by my decor,
I love me some trophies.
Sue, I did what I did to you
out of anger.
I thought destroying you
would pull me out of my funk.
But... just made things worse.
So is that an apology?
Yes, it is.
And you're not alone, Sue.
Your kids need you,
so you do have love
in your life.
My kids don't love me;
They fear me.
Hand me my bullhorn, will you?
{feedback squeals}
Amelda!
Make me a shake!
To go!
AMELDA:
Hooray.
Make it two.
{bell ringing}
{cell phone rings}
Hello.
JESSIE:
Meet me out in the parking lot.
{piano plays gentle melody}
{laughing}
I hear you're a vegan, Berry.
The souls of those
poor egg fetuses
are all on your conscience now.
{laughs}
Do it, Jessie.
Are you with us or not?
Do it.
Break it
like you broke my heart.
I loved you.
Now...
nightmares of all of the mothers
of the little baby chicks
coming after me for revenge.
Oh, this is bull!
Finn, Mike, Matt, come with me.
Right on. It's time for less
talking and more punching.
Hey, what's going on?
We're on our way to go all
Braveheart on Vocal Adrenaline.
Guys, violence is never
the answer.
It is when the question is
"What's the best way to mess up
that Jessie kid's face?!"
Mr. Shue, Rachel's one of us.
We're the only ones
who get to humiliate her.
Stop!
Get back here and sit down!
Look, I know from experience
that making someone else suffer
doesn't make your pain go away.
You're all amazing, no matter
what Vocal Adrenaline
says or does.
We just need to find a way
to remind ourselves of that.
We can't just let
Vocal Adrenaline get away
with turning Rachel
into an omelet.
We're not.
Rachel, dial Jessie's
number on your phone.
SANTANA: You haven't
deleted his number yet?
Jessie St. James?
Will Schuester here.
You and Vocal Adrenaline need
to meet at our auditorium
Friday, 3:00 sharp.
BRETT PAXTON: Let's hear it
from the internationally ranked
Cheerios coach Sue Sylvester.
Coach, six consecutive
National titles.
You're the Michael Jordan
of cheerleading.
Thanks, Brett, I am.
Sue, let us know about
the decision you made
to have Kurt Hummel here
do a 14-and-a-half minute
Celine Dion medley,
entirely in French.
Well, I'll tell you what, Brett,
I'm all about finding
a freakish, depressed kid
and showing him
what winning is all about.
Whoo! {giggles} Well...
well, Sue, congratulations,
but I have to ask you,
where are you going to put
that mammoth
skyscraping trophy?
I know just the place.
{doorbell rings}
Get out.
{whispers}:
I'm sorry, Mr. Shue.
Wow. You did it, Sue...
I'll do the talking,
thank you very much.
Let me break it down
for you, William.
You're standing at a crossroads.
You have two choices:
Number one:
This trophy will be installed
in the choir room
in a custom-built
bulletproof case
as a daily reminder
of your failure
as a man and an educator.
And what's choice number two?
You can kiss me...
...right here on the lips...
...with tongue.
This is payback, isn't it?
No one will know?
Fine.
You know what?
I'm not gonna do this.
Even your breath stinks
of mediocrity.
It's making me sick.

RACHEL:
Thanks for coming.
After your brazen escalation
of our growing dispute,
which we were willing
to put to rest, we decided
the only way to truly funkify
you is to show you
the one thing
we know you can't do.
So enjoy.

See you punks at Regionals.
They did a funk number.
We've never been able
to pull off a funk number.
Well, that's because we're
soulless automatons.
I'm so depressed.
