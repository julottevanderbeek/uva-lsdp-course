LET'S GET HIM
ON HIS FEET.
OSCAR, YOU O.K.?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
ALL RIGHT?
LET'S DO IT AGAIN!
I AM SO GLAD.
I WANT EVERYBODY TO BE HAPPY
ON CHRISTMAS EVE.
TONIGHT SANTA CLAUS COMES.
HE TAKES HIS BIG BAG OF TOYS
AND SLIDES DOWN THE CHIMNEY!
OH, COME ON.
DO YOU KNOW HOW BIG
THE INSIDE OF A CHIMNEY IS?
ABOUT THIS BIG!
SANTA IS BUILT
LIKE A DUMP TRUCK.
HOW WILL HE COME DOWN
THOSE SKINNY, LITTLE CHIMNEYS?
HE HOLDS HIS BREATH
LIKE THIS.
THAT'S LIKE TRYING
TO GET A BASKETBALL
INTO A GINGER ALE BOTTLE!
HE COMES IN THE WINDOW.
LOCKED.
THE DOOR?
LOCKED.
THE OLD INCINERATOR SHAFT.
NO! IT'S THE CHIMNEY
OR NOTHING.
I DON'T KNOW
HOW SANTA GETS IN.
IF I WAS YOU,
I WOULD FIND OUT.
IF HE DOES NOT GET IN,
THERE WILL BE A LOT
OF EMPTY STOCKINGS TOMORROW.
HEH HEH HEH.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
HEH HEH HEH.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
YOU SAID
YOU COULD NOT SKATE!
YOU SAID
YOU COULD NOT SKATE!
I DON'T KNOW HOW SANTA
COMES DOWN THE CHIMNEY,
BUT WE WILL FIND OUT.
HUH, PATTY?
BUT WE WILL FIND OUT.
HUH, PATTY?
## I BELIEVE IN MIRACLES ##

## FLOATING THROUGH THE AIR ##
## TO JINGLE BELLS OF CHRISTMAS ##
## AND IF THAT ISN'T

SMELLS GOOD.
THIS KEEPS
YOUR EARS WARM.
GO ON!
HEY, OSCAR, WAIT!
I KNOW HOW SANTA
GETS DOWN THE CHIMNEY.
HE TIES HIS BIG BELT
TIGHT AROUND HIS WASTE.
IT MAKES HIM SO SKINNY,
HE FITS DOWN THE CHIMNEY.
YOU ARE WITHOUT A DOUBT
THE STUPIDEST...
BIRD I EVER MET.
BIRD I EVER MET.
## BUT THE GREATEST WONDER
OF THEM ALL ##
## IS NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING
AROUND YOU ##

OSCAR, SANTA COVERS
HIMSELF WITH BUTTER
SO HE CAN SLIP
RIGHT DOWN THE CHIMNEY.
SO HE CAN SLIP
RIGHT DOWN THE CHIMNEY.
DING-DONG,
YOU'RE WRONG.
I DON'T THINK
THERE IS A WAY
HE CAN GET DOWN THE CHIMNEY.
AND IF HE DOESN'T,
NO YOU-KNOW-WHATS
TOMORROW MORNING.
NO YOU-KNOW-WHATS
TOMORROW MORNING.
## FEELINGS

HI, BIG BIRD.
HI, PATTY.
HOW WAS
THE SKATING PARTY?
OH, O.K.
JUST O.K.?
WHAT'S WRONG?
EVERYTHING WAS O.K.
UNTIL OSCAR STARTED...
"HOW DOES SANTA CLAUS
GET DOWN THOSE SKINNY CHIMNEYS
WHEN HE'S SO FAT?"
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT.
"IF HE CAN'T GET DOWN,
NO ONE WILL GET PRESENTS!"
THAT'S WHAT OSCAR SAYS.
I SEE. LET US
CONSIDER THE QUESTION.
HOW DOES BIG, FAT SANTA CLAUS
GET DOWN THOSE SKINNY CHIMNEYS?
WELL...AHEM.
LET US LOOK AT IT
FROM ANOTHER ANGLE.
UH...RETURNING
TO THE FIRST ANGLE,
IT'S A SIMPLE MATTER
OF, UH...
I NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT IT BEFORE.
HOW DOES HE DO IT?
IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE!
WE GOT TO FIND OUT!
WHO KNOWS MORE
ABOUT SANTA THAN ANYBODY?
THE ELVES.
MRS. CLAUS?
MACY'S.
KIDS. THAT'S WHO.
KIDS?
YEAH, KIDS!
I WILL GO ASK SOME KIDS
AND BE RIGHT BACK
WITH THE ANSWER.
KERMIT, I AM A KID,
AND I DON'T KNOW.
THAT'S OUR FIRST ANSWER,
ISN'T IT?
THAT'S OUR FIRST ANSWER,
ISN'T IT?
GOLLY...
CHRISTMAS EVE.
I STILL DON'T
HAVE AN IDEA
FOR ERNIE'S PRESENT.
IT'S GOT TO BE
REALLY SPECIAL.
WHAT IS--
OH, ERNIE'S RUBBER DUCKIE.
HEY, WAIT!
THAT GIVES ME
A NEAT-O IDEA!
I WILL GET ERNIE
A SOAP DISH
TO PUT
HIS RUBBER DUCKIE IN!
WHAT A NIFTY IDEA!
WHAT A NIFTY IDEA!
I AM HOME, BERT.
OH, BERT?
OH! WHAT'S THIS?
IT'S A PAPER CLIP FROM
BERT'S PAPER CLIP COLLECTION.
OF COURSE!
THIS IS BERT'S 1957 ACME.
HE WOULD FEEL AWFUL
IF HE LOST THIS.
I KNOW WHAT
I WILL GET BERT FOR CHRISTMAS!
A CIGAR BOX
TO KEEP HIS PAPER CLIPS IN!
THEY WILL NEVER
GET LOST AGAIN.
THEY WILL NEVER
GET LOST AGAIN.
IF SANTA CLAUS
HAS TO DELIVER
ALL THOSE PRESENTS
ON CHRISTMAS EVE,
HOW DOES HE GET DOWN
THE CHIMNEY?
EASY.
WITH THE BAG
OF PRESENTS.
HOW?
HE COMES DOWN
WITH HIS REINDEERS.
HE COMES DOWN
WITH HIS REINDEERS.
ALL THE REINDEER
JOIN HIM
DOWN THE CHIMNEY?
YES.
YOU MEAN
IT'S A PARTY?
YES. THEY PUT THE PRESENTS,
THEN THEY GO UP.
DON'T THE ANTLERS
GET STUCK?
NO.
WHY?
HE TIES
THE ANTLERS TOGETHER...
WITH TAPE.
WITH TAPE.
TELL ME,
HOW DOES HE DO IT?
HE SLIDES!
SLIDES?
WAIT! MAYBE HE IS MAGIC
AND GROWS SMALL.
THROUGH THE DOOR.
HE GOTS
HIS KEYS.
WHAT KEYS?
SANTA CLAUS KEYS.
HE SQUISHES!
WHAT HAPPENS
IF SANTA
CANNOT GET DOWN
THE CHIMNEY,
AND THE WINDOW
AND DOOR ARE LOCKED?
HE WILL NEVER
BRING THE PRESENTS
EVER AGAIN!
WHAT HAPPENS?
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THEY WILL MOVE.
HE PUSHES THE BUTTON,
THEN IT OPENS,
AND HE GETS IN!
HE STEPS ON THE BIG STEP,
THEN HE GOES IN.
AND THERE
YOU HAVE IT.
SPIRIT
GIVING
PEACE
BOB IS COMING!
BOB IS COMING!
HI, KIDS.
HI, BOB.
LINDA, YOU ARE EARLY.
WE HAVE TO REHEARSE
A SONG WITH THE KIDS.
WOULD YOU MIND WAITING?
MAYBE YOU CAN
READ A MAGAZINE.

EVERYBODY
ALL READY?
YES.
RUBY, WOULD YOU
TURN PAGES FOR ME?

KERMIT, WHAT DID
YOU LEARN ABOUT
HOW SANTA GETS DOWN
ALL THOSE CHIMNEYS?
OUR SURVEY WOULD INDICATE
THAT THE SOLUTION IS NOT
ALTOGETHER DEFINITIVE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
LET ME READ SOME QUOTES.
"SANTA CLAUS GOES
ON A CRASH DIET
EVERY CHRISTMAS EVE
AND LOSES 200 POUNDS."
SEVERAL KIDS BELIEVE
THEY HAVE RUBBER CHIMNEYS.
ONE GIRL SAID,
"SANTA SNEAKS IN
"WITH THE REST OF
THE RELATIVES ON THANKSGIVING
AND HIDES IN THE LAUNDRY
UNTIL CHRISTMAS."
"SANTA HAS VERY,
VERY LONG ARMS."
GOT SOMETHING IN HERE
ABOUT A CHIMNEY STRETCHER,
A FISHING POLE.
THIS ISN'T
GETTING US ANYWHERE!
IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE,
AND WE DON'T KNOW
IF SANTA CLAUS
WILL MAKE IT
DOWN THE CHIMNEY.
WILL MAKE IT
DOWN THE CHIMNEY.
"DEAR SANTY CLAUS,
"ME NO CARE WHAT KIND COOKIES
YOU BRING ME.
"YOU SURPRISE
COOKIE MONSTER,
O.K.?"
QUESTION MARK.
BOY, ME WONDER
WHAT KIND COOKIES
SANTY GOING TO BRING ME.
OH, MAYBE

WE'RE GOING TO USE
THE SCIENTIFIC WAY
TO FIND OUT HOW SANTA CLAUS
GETS HIS BIG TUMMY

REMEMBER, YOU PLAY

OH, GEE.
PRETEND HE HAS 1
OF HIS REINDEER WITH HIM.
AAH. ER. AAH.
OH, BIRD.
HMM?
IT'S GETTING HARDER
TO HO HO HO.
LET ME LOOK OVER HERE

ON THIS.
LET'S SEE.
FROM HERE--AHA.

NO. YOU STAY THERE.
OH, SNUFFY--I MEAN,
SANTA CLAUS,
LOOK, YOU'VE DONE IT!
NOW WE KNOW HOW SANTA
GETS INTO THE CHIMNEYS.
JUST ONE THING, BIRD.
DO WE KNOW HOW
HE GETS OUT?
DO WE KNOW HOW
HE GETS OUT?
I'LL SEE YOU LATER,
BOB.
I HAVE A LITTLE ERRAND
TO DO.
OK. OH, MR. HOOPER.

HE'LL NEVER GET
DOWN THE CHIMNEY,
AND NO ONE WILL GET
ANY PRESENTS.
HEY! WAIT A MINUTE!
I CAN FIND OUT
HOW HE GETS DOWN
THOSE LITTLE
BITTY CHIMNEYS.
GORDON, ME TRY
TO WRITE LETTER
TO SANTA CLAUS,
BUT ME GOT HUNGRY,
AND ME ATE PENCIL.
DON'T WORRY,
COOKIE MONSTER.
ME NOT WRITE LETTER!
ME ATE TYPEWRITER,
TOO.
SANTA KNOWS ABOUT YOU.
HE'LL BRING YOU
SOME COOKIES.
ME TRIED
TO CALL SANTA,
BUT TELEPHONE LOOKED
LIKE CUPPY CAKES,
AND ME ATE IT.
SANTA NEVER BRING
COOKIE MONSTER COOKIES.
YES, HE WILL,
COOKIE MONSTER,
BUT MAYBE YOU COULD
LEAVE HIM SOMETHING, TOO.
OH, THAT TERRIFIC IDEA!
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
SANTA CLAUS
LEAVE ME COOKIES,
AND ME LEAVE
SANTA...NECKTIE.
YOU COULD.
OR SHAVING CREAM.
MOST PEOPLE LEAVE HIM--
WHAT?
COOKIES.
COOKIES.
OH, HI, PATTY.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
BIG BIRD'S GONE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
HE'S GONE?
ISN'T HE
IN HIS NEST?
NO. HE'S NOT ANYWHERE.
HE WAS ACTING FUNNY
WHEN I LEFT HIM.
I THOUGHT ABOUT HIM,
I WENT BACK,
AND HE WAS GONE.
WELL, LOOK,
DON'T WORRY, PATTY.
WE'LL FIND HIM, OK?
SUSAN, BETTER GET
YOUR COAT.
SUSAN, BETTER GET
YOUR COAT.
HI, FELLAS. HOW'S THINGS

HAS SANTA CLAUS
BEEN HERE YET?
NO. OH, GOOD.
I'LL CHECK OUT
THE CHIMNEY.
I'LL CHECK OUT
THE CHIMNEY.
THERE'S OUR SKINNY,
LITTLE CHIMNEY.
I'M JUST GOING TO
STAY HERE AND WATCH
AND SEE HOW SANTA
GETS DOWN THAT LITTLE THING.
BRRR! IT IS COLD!
I DON'T SEE HOW
THOSE PENGUINS CAN TAKE IT.
I DON'T SEE HOW
THOSE PENGUINS CAN TAKE IT.

BIG BIRD'S MISSING

WE'RE GOING TO GROVER'S
TO CHECK. BYE.

BIG BIRD?
HE'S MISSING.
HE'S MISSING.
LOOK AT EVERYBODY
DOWN THERE.
THEY'RE ALL
RUNNING AROUND.
SOMEONE MUST BE LOST.
I HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS
TO WORRY ABOUT.
WHEN THE SLEIGH FLIES IN,
I'LL SAY TO SANTA CLAUS,
"O.K. IF I WATCH YOU GO DOWN
THAT SKINNY, LITTLE CHIMNEY?"
I COULD EVEN HELP.
BRRR!
BRRR!
AHH.
AHH.
BOY, I HOPE
HE COMES SOON.
BOY, I HOPE
HE COMES SOON.
NO LUCK,
HUH, BOB?
NOPE.
IT'S SNOWING HARDER.
HE COULD FREEZE
OUT TONIGHT.
I'LL TRY
OVER THERE.
I'LL TRY
OVER THERE.
BIG BIRD,
PLEASE COME HOME.
BIG BIRD,
PLEASE COME HOME.
OH.
NO. NOT YET.
OH, GEE,
WHAT IF HE'S STUCK
IN A CHIMNEY SOMEWHERE
OR STACKED OVER KENNEDY?
OHH.
OHH.
BIG BIRD!
BIG BIRD!
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
MARIA?
I HOPE
YOU'RE SATISFIED.
YOU HAD TO START
THAT STUFF
ABOUT SANTA
AND TINY CHIMNEYS.
YOU'VE UPSET BIG BIRD
SO MUCH, HE'S GONE.
I DIDN'T KNOW HE'D DO
ANYTHING DUMB.
I WAS TEASING.
TELLING HIM SANTA WON'T
BRING ANYBODY PRESENTS
BECAUSE HE CAN'T GET
DOWN THE TINY CHIMNEY!
YOU CALL THAT TEASING?
HE'LL COME BACK.
HE'S PART HOMING PIGEON.
BESIDES,
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
HE LIVES OUTDOORS, ANYWAY.
THE NEST IS DIFFERENT.
THAT'S HIS HOME.
HE'S GOT AN ELECTRIC
BLANKET THERE.
HE'S AROUND
THE PEOPLE HE LOVES.
IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE,
AND HE'S OUT THERE
IN THIS BIG CITY.
IT KEEPS SNOWING,
AND IT'S GETTING COLDER.
HE COULD BE
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?
I'LL FIND HIM
AND BRING HIM BACK.
GET ME OFF OF HERE!
HURRY UP.
GET MY FEET ON THE GROUND.
HURRY UP, SKINNY!
O.K. HEY, TURKEY,
WHERE ARE YOU?
IT'S ME, OLD OSCAR.
IT'S ME, OLD OSCAR.
COME BACK.
OH, OH.
OH, THAT'S FUNNY.
I COULD HAVE SWORN
I HEARD SANTA,
BUT THERE'S
NO ONE HERE.
BUT THERE'S
NO ONE HERE.
NOT EVEN ANY FOOTPRINTS
IN THE SNOW.
NOT EVEN ANY FOOTPRINTS
IN THE SNOW.
WHAT A DREAM I HAD!
I MUST HAVE
FALLEN ASLEEP.
WOW! AM I COLD!
I BETTER GO DOWN
TO GORDON AND SUSAN'S
AND WARM UP
FOR A MINUTE.
BRRR!
BRRR!
OOH! I THINK
I FROZE MY GIBLETS!
OOH! I THINK
I FROZE MY GIBLETS!
LET'S GO INSIDE
AND GET WARMED UP,
CALL YOUR MOTHER
SO SHE DOESN'T WORRY.
BIG BIRD!
OH, HI, PATTY.
HOW ARE YOU?
FINE.
HI. I WAS--
OH, HI, GORDON.
HI, SUSAN.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YES, EXCEPT
FOR MY GIBLETS.
BIG BIRD,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I WENT UP ON THE ROOF
TO WATCH FOR SANTA.
I GOT SO COLD,
I CAME DOWN TO WARM UP,
BUT I'M GOING
RIGHT BACK UP.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
COME IN AND THAW OUT.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
COME IN AND THAW OUT.
OH, DEAR.
NOW I'LL NEVER KNOW
HOW HE DID IT.
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT OSCAR SAID TO YOU?
OSCAR SAID
THAT IF SANTA
CAN'T GET DOWN
THOSE LITTLE CHIMNEYS,
NO ONE WOULD GET
ANY PRESENTS.
WELL, LOOK AROUND YOU.
DOES IT LOOK TO YOU
LIKE NO ONE'S
GETTING ANY PRESENTS?
NO, BUT IT'S
A MIRACLE.
HOW DID HE DO IT?
WHY DO YOU
WANT TO KNOW?
IT'S IMPORTANT.
NO, BIG BIRD.
THAT'S NOT
WHAT'S IMPORTANT.
WHATISIMPORTANT
IS WE LOST YOU TONIGHT.
WE WERE VERY WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.
NOW YOU'RE BACK,
SAFE AND SOUND,
AND WE'RE ALL TOGETHER
FOR CHRISTMAS AGAIN.
AND WE'RE ALL TOGETHER
FOR CHRISTMAS AGAIN.

A TRUE BLUE MIRACLE ##

I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK,
'CAUSE I WANT TO
ASK YOU A QUESTION.
