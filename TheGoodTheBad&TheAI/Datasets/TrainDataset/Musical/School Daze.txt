DAP:
What question?
What question?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's right.
Yes!
JULIAN: Gammites!
GAMMITES:
DAP:
SLIM DADDY: Gammites, halt!
GAMMITE: Real.
Real.
Real.
Real.
SLIM DADDY: Gammites!
Gammites!
Gammites!
GAMMITES:
It takes a real man
to be a Gamma man
'cause only a Gamma man
is a real man.
You know what, Julian?
I thought that
was really nice.
I really did.
Now, why don't you
take your Gamma dogs
and get the fuck out of here?
We of Gamma Phi Gamma
do not agree
with this
African mumbo jumbo.
And I am here
to let you know that your
revolutionary activities
here at Mission College
are detrimental
not only to the student body
and the administration,
but to our
brothers and sisters
in South Africa, as well.
ALL: Meow!
You need to
wake up, Julian.
That's right,
God damn it.
Now, fellas, just wait!
As President
of the Student
Government Association,
and a key-wearing member
of Phi Beta Kappa,
I abhor and will
not tolerate violence
or the threat of violence
on this sacred campus.
MAN 1:
Fuck you, scrotum face!
Yo, man.
MAN 2: Yo, read a book.
It is safe to say
that President McPherson
agrees with me, 100%.
So let's break this up.
Virgil, why don't you
shut the fuck up?
You heard what I said.
Please, will you leave?
Dap, he did
say "please."
STUDENT:
Shut up, Monroe.
Okay.
STUDENT:
This guy's full of shit, man.
Come on. Let's go.
MAN 1: Hey, homeboy.
MAN 2:
Squash all that.
Squash all that.
SLIM DADDY: Gammites!
GAMMITES:
GAMMITES:
Rachel...
Dap.
Man...
Don't pay him no mind.
He's just trying
to make you angry.
Julian is bugged.
No, Julian is smart, Rachel.
He's confused,
but he's smart.
Come on.
Walk me to my class.
I can't. I gotta...
I gotta stay here.
I gotta stay
in shantytown.
See you later?
Yeah.
Okay.
Don't worry about it.
Be crisp, be clean!
Roll call!
Gammites!
ALL: Greetings,
Dean Big Brother Almighty,
most eloquent leader
of Gamma Phi Gamma.
Gammites!
ALL: Hello,
Big Brother General
George Patton, sir!
Gammites!
Hello, Big Brother Chucky.
No rush!
Gammites!
Hello,
Big Brother Dr. Feelgood.
Gammites!
Hello, Big Brother Lance.
Gammites!
What up,
Big Brother X-Ray Vision?
I don't like none
of these motherfuckers.
Hey, man, you know,
I hear they've been
trying to get some trim.
ALL: Oh, shit!
Julian, how long
these sorry moonheads
been on line, anyhow?
Word.
Gammites,
do you hear this?
Six weeks on line
and you still do not
meet the approval
of your Big Brothers.
This deeply grieves my heart.
Now, when you began,
there were 10 Gammites.
Now,
only eight remain.
Now, I do not know
how many of you will
cross the burning sands
to the oasis of
Gamma Phi Gamma.
But I do know
that there is no room
for any pretenders.
A weak link
amongst the ranks.
Which one of you is it?
CHUCKY:
Slim Daddy!
LANCE:
No, not my personal Slim.
Rhino teeth.
Yo, homes,
don't be putting it on Slim.
Mussolini.
Mussolini.
Yeah, him definitely.
Work it.
Sir Nosey.
Sir Nose.
That's a nose.
Yoda, definitely.
Yoda wears...
No, it couldn't be Yoda.
It was Nose.
It was Nose.
Yoda,
there's no truth but truth.
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Mustafa.
Mustafa.
GAMMAS: Double Rubber!
Double rubber,
I bet.
Oh, Doo-Doo Breath!
Doo-Doo. Doo-Doo.
Unsavory students.
Half-Pint!
Yes,
Dean Big Brother Almighty.
How tall are you?
Five feet, five inches.
Yeah, you're a 5'5"
piece of shit.
Yes,
Dean Big Brother Almighty.
I don't even know
why you pledged.
This is not for you.
Gamma men are real men.
I am a real man,
a Gamma man.
Were you asked to speak?
You're not a Gamma man yet.
Brothers, I suspect
this sawed-off human being
hasn't even
had a girl yet.
It's not true.
Oh, isn't that right?
I bet you're still a virgin,
aren't you?
No,
Dean Big Brother Almighty.
Are you calling me a liar?
No,
Dean Big Brother Almighty.
I haven't been
a virgin since ninth grade.
Bullshit!
You're a goddamn virgin!
You ain't seen
no parts of the pussy.
I'm not no virgin.
Hey, you'll become a Gamma man
over my dead body.
I don't even know
how you got this far.
You're weak, a pussy.
And you're gonna drop,
just like your cousin.
I'll be a good Gamma man.
You'll see, you'll see.
Look, don't be eyeballing me.
GAMMA:
Lay off him, Julian.
You'll become a Gamma man
over my dead body.
Now, look.
You better get
a freak over here tonight.
And no Gamma Rays, neither.
I don't care
if she's blind, fat,
no teeth,
one leg and a kickstand.
I ain't pledging no virgins.
You got it?
So you get that freak
over here tonight.
Now straighten up
and get the hell out
of here, all of you!
Get that smile
off your face.
Darrell.
Sorry, but I can't
let the Big Brothers
see me talking to you.
Thanks a lot.
So what's up?
Dean Big Brother Almighty
went off on me.
I told you not to pledge.
So what else is new?
I gotta bring a girlie back
to the Gamma House tonight.
He thinks I'm a virgin.
Ah, for once in his life
he's right.
Come on, Dap.
So what you want me to do?
The Gamma grapevine says
we'll be going over
tomorrow night.
And any fault they find
will "X" me.
Mmm-hmm.
I'm your first cousin,
family blood.
You've got to help me.
Hey, Darrell,
when you needed money,
I gave it to you.
When you needed
your laundry done,
I did it for you.
I got you food and stuff
for your Big Brothers.
I just don't happen
to have no females
laying around the dorm.
And even if I did,
I wouldn't help you
like that, man.
This one day,
can you forget
about your differences
with Dean
Big Brother Almighty?
You mean Julian?
No,
Dean Big Brother Almighty.
Uh-uh, Julian.
No, I mean
Dean Big Brother Almighty.
All right, already, Darrell.
Damn.
Vaughn. Think about me.
This'll be my neck.
Can't you talk to Rachel?
She has a lot of girlfriends.
Rachel? No, no, no, no.
No haps, man. What,
have you been smoking crack?
Don't you know any women?
The ones I know
I asked already.
Well, what about the ones
you don't know?
Did you ask them?
What am I gonna say?
Say, uh...
I don't know. Tell them
what they want to hear.
You know,
lie your butt off, man.
Okay, okay. Better yet,
just be yourself,
Darrell,
okay?
Okay.
Come on, man.
Come on. Get up.
Come on. Get up, get up.
Get up.
You will be
a Gamma man tomorrow.
Think so?
You damn skippy.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You go first.
We wouldn't want
Dean Big Brother Almighty
to see us together,
would we?
Very funny.
Thanks, cuz.
I won't forget this.
All right, man.
Gamma!
Yeah, yeah.
This man had a vision.
And that vision
was passed down
to his son, Hayward.
Mission College
was founded to educate
the sons and daughters
of slaves...
You don't have to
recite our history to me.
Now, we have been
and we'll continue
to be grateful
for the support
of the Snodgrass family.
The food is getting cold.
Oh, all right.
CEDAR:
Hold it. I've got
something else to say.
This is a new day.
There is a feeling
that the predominantly
black college,
for all intents and purposes,
has outlived its usefulness.
Over the years,
it has been vital
to our elevation
in this great country,
but the need no longer exists
in an integrated society.
That's absurd.
It does exist.
It exists at Notre Dame
and Yeshiva, Brandeis,
at Brigham Young.
Now you tell me,
what is the difference?
You want to know
the difference?
I'll tell you the difference.
The difference is
that the Catholics alone
support the Notre Dames.
The Jews alone
support the Yeshivas.
Mormons support
the Brigham Youngs.
Who supports
the black colleges?
I'll tell you who.
The federal government
and philanthropists
like Snodgrass.
Harold,
why won't blacks support
Spelman, Tuskegee,
Morehouse, Howard?
We do.
Barely!
Look,
as Chairman of the Board,
I was sent here
to talk with you.
Now, he does not like
this divestment mess,
and I don't like it, either.
Now, you better snip it
right here at the bud,
or I will.
'Cause if you don't,
you stand a good chance
of losing them.
There it is.
Yeah. People like them
don't like to be told
what to do with their money.
Old, old money.
Shit, I tell you all
time after time,
do not sit here again.
Stay off my bed.
Stay in your own room.
Ignorant motherfuckers,
I swear, man.
Sorry about the bed, homeboy.
But check this out,
we got a question
for you, man.
What's up
with your cousin Half-Pint?
Yo, man, why is he pledging?
Oops.
Yo, man, you wanna
take your last breath?
I didn't think so.
That's my cousin.
You leave him alone.
You don't talk
about him like that.
We understand each other?
I'm sorry, man.
But seriously, man,
what's up with the Pint, man?
But seriously,
who's going back
to the administration building
with me tonight?
GRADY: Not the kid. Uh-uh.
Man, you crazy?
We're going to the coronation.
More butts
and more titties.
That's right,
God damn it.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I thought y'all was down
for the cause.
Yeah, you my brother,
but goddamn, man.
That's right,
goddamn.
You should
lighten up on that shit,
Malcolm, seriously.
He's right, Nat Turner.
Marcus Garvey.
Frederick Douglass.
Yeah. You all can kiss
my black ass twice, hear?
Preach, Jesse. Preach on.
Yo, Farrakhan, relax.
Don't be so sensitive,
my man. Chill.
What about the parade?
Somebody coming
to the parade with me, maybe?
Hey, I'm down, man,
but not tonight.
I gots to see some
butts shaking, you know.
Word up. I'm with him.
That ain't no joke, man.
I can't...
What about the rest of y'all?
Tomorrow.
All right, bet.
Enjoy yourselves.
I'll see you all
tomorrow morning,
9:00 a.m. sharp.
That's Kool and the Gang,
brother.
Later.
Jordan, this look familiar?
Looks like your mother.
Yo, yo, my ball, man.
You don't need it.
Gamma.
Anybody call me? Perry.
How you doing?
How are you?
You recognize me?
Yeah, I've seen you on line.
Aren't you number one?
Yeah, that's me.
Half-Pint,
Gammite number one.
Gamma Phi Gamma.
Pleased to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
So it's almost
that time, huh?
Yeah, it'll be any day now.
Are you excited?
A little.
So, Half-Pint,
what can I do for you?
Well, I was wondering maybe
if we could see each other,
go out to a movie,
a restaurant,
pop some Jiffy Pop
popcorn together.
You know,
enjoy each other's company.
Yeah, sure.
That'd be nice.
That sounds real good.
Why don't you come by
after you go over.
I'm usually in at night.
I was thinking soon.
How soon?
Like now,
at the Gamma House.
Sorry.
I can't.
We could have fun.
Big fun.
Just give me one reason
why not, just one.
First of all,
I don't know you from Adam.
You just pop out of thin air,
and I'm supposed to say yes?
I've always been
attracted to you.
I just couldn't
tell you before.
I was shy.
But now that
I've been pledging,
I'm a different person.
Well, I'm not
attracted to you.
Besides, I don't want
a physical relationship.
All you guys are dogs.
I've heard about you Gammas.
I'm not trying to dog you.
Look at my face.
Can't a real Gamma man
be attracted to you, huh?
Is this some type of a joke?
Did your Big Brother
send you over here?
I don't have time
for children's games.
And you're so small,
I'd probably break you in two.
WOMAN:
See? See? See?
I knew it. I knew it.
That's okay.
DINA:
I call to order
the 35th meeting
of the Sister Order
of Gamma Phi Gamma
Fraternity, Incorporated.
Meow.
GAMMA RAYS: Meow.
Kim, could you
read the minutes
from the last meeting,
please?
All right.
We decided that Velda
will take care of the music
for the fashion show.
Velda, please, none of that
hip-hop, B-boys nonsense.
GAMMA RAYS: Yeah.
I happen to like Run-DMC.
Nevertheless,
leave it at home.
Miriam,
did you call the boutiques?
Yes, I did.
Did you make
a list of the suppliers?
Yes, I did.
She is such
a pain in the ass.
Look. Let's not
make this long, okay?
We have to get dressed.
Now what have we decided?
Okay. I talked to the Brothers
and the Gammites
are definitely going over
tomorrow night.
GAMMA RAYS: All right.
So we should
give them a party.
ALL: Yes.
They haven't
had fun for so long,
a jam will be on.
Where, at the frat house?
Yeah, at the Gamma House.
The brothers
said it was cool,
but we have to
clean up first.
MIRIAM: Clean up?
Are you crazy?
Look,
we have been cleaning up
after those sorry,
tired, trifling,
shiftless Negroes
from day one.
And I am not cleaning up.
I refuse to clean.
Miriam, why are you
always complaining?
This is for G-Phi-G.
For the black and silver.
Yet and still,
I am no maid.
And we are?
TASHA:
Well, I have a question.
Who's gonna pay
for it this time?
We're giving it,
we should pay for it.
GAMMA RAY:
We always pay for it.
Common sense.
We are gonna pay for it.
Now, Dina,
how much did we make
from the bake sale?
Enough.
I'm not going
to the party.
Where's the freaks?
Here's to
the Liberty Bowl, man.
Couldn't get one.
Oh, shit!
You've been jamming us up
since we started, man.
If I don't go over...
I'm coming up.
Asked four women.
What's wrong with five?
Come on, man.
Yo, yo, yo.
Hold up, hold up.
Listen, Half-Pint.
You got to go back out
and bring in a freak.
Two freaks.
Yeah.
Here's $5.
All this is is a test.
And you're going to pass
with flying colors.
I want you to take
that $5 US currency
and go to the pet shop,
get yourself a kitten.
Put it in a cage
and mark it "Pussy."
Give it to Dean
Big Brother Almighty
and say, "Pass the pussy."
HALF-PINT:
It won't work.
The word is "excuse me."
Nobody told you
to stand in the hall either.
Excuse me.
That's better,
Miss Thing.
Uh-uh.
It's not real.
DINA: Say what?
You heard.
It ain't even real.
You wish you had
hair like this.
Girl, you know
you weren't even born
with blue eyes.
That's right.
Blue contact lenses.
You're just jealous.
Right.
Jealous?
Rachel,
I've been watching you
look at Julian.
You're not slick.
If that was true,
he wasn't much to look at.
Tell her, Rachel.
Pickaninny.
Barbie doll.
High-yellow heifer.
Tar baby.
Wannabe white.
Jigaboo.
Don't start.
We're gonna finish it.
WOMAN:
Re-Re, open up!
ALL:
Yeah?
Get off.
Stop it!
Uh-uh, honey.
Get out!
Whoa!
Get out of here,
Miriam!
All right, there it is.
I'll get you,
Rachel.
Move out of my way.
Oh, my hair!
Don't even try it!
Go, girl.
You better dance,
girl.
Sharon! Knock her down.
Knock her down.
You better get out
of my face, girl.
Knock her down.
You gotta hold her back.
Don't worry.
You better
point that somewhere else.
ALL: Jigs!
Jigs!
Hey, get off me!
Get off!
What are you doing?
Watch it!
Get out of here!
What do you think
you're doing?
Get back.
You better learn how
to control your girl.
I'm not playing
with you, Rachel.
Heifer.
Jigaboo.
Don't try it.
Watch it.
I will.
Wake up!
Move! Move! Move!
Gammites!
ALL: Greetings to the elite
Big Brothers
of Gamma Phi Gamma
Fraternity Incorporated
Alpha Chapter!
GAMMITES: Oh, shit!
YODA:
Most honorable Big Brothers,
we only beg
for your forgiveness!
Enough!
Now, what we have here
is a menace to Gamma society.
That's right.
Get on with this.
DR. FEELGOOD: Now, I motion
for the death penalty.
That'll work.
The Chair, having
recognized Dr. Feelgood,
without objection
the motion is carried.
Grill these bastards.
MAN: Grill.
Death will be too good
for these offenders
of the law.
Brothers?
Yes, sir.
Let's make the streets
safe to walk again.
Hear, hear.
For the women and chilluns.
Right.
See, we're gonna
have to make a decision
between the gas chamber,
the electric chair,
or death by goddamn
lethal injection.
You're guilty
of eight counts of treason.
MAN:
Like a big bitch.
Guilty
of eight counts
of conspiracy.
I know you conspired.
Having been found
guilty as charged,
I hereby
sentence you to meet...
Oh, no,
Big Brother Almighty, no!
No, no.
Big Bertha!
GAMMITE:
Be still! Lights out!
What the fuck is this?
JULIAN:
Drop your sweats!
Move. Let's go.
Look at them drawers.
Bend over
and assume the position.
In other words,
knock it out of here, yeah!
JULIAN:
Play ball!
Ow!
I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs,
cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!
You like me. You like me.
That's right.
Yeah. That's right.
Fathers, forgive us
for we have sinned.
There's nothing to fear
but fear itself.
Fear this. Fear this.
Miss Jane Diva's
gonna get it.
Yeah.
Isn't she on the Gamma court?
Not only is she on the court,
she is the queen.
Rachel, what are you doing?
If we don't leave now,
we're not gonna get
a seat at the coronation.
That's right, Rachel.
Let's go.
You can study later.
I'm not going.
Well, I suppose
Dap isn't going, either.
Now, you know
that has nothing
to do with it.
Spare me, Rachel.
Rachel, you haven't
seen anybody else
since freshman year.
Don't you ever feel
like seeing other guys,
like having
other relationships?
No.
Yes, you do, Rachel.
No, I don't.
Come on.
Listen, Dap's a good guy.
I like him.
One of the more
positive brothers
on this campus, right, Lizzie?
That's right.
But I bet you
he's snaking.
Ooh.
He can't help it.
He's a man.
It's their nature.
Mmm-mmm.
Are you coming
or not, Rachel?
No, I'm not going.
Oh, come on, Doris.
You are tired.
She's tired, man.
She put the "T" in tired.
And that's all
somebody would have to do
to get a bus
and put a sign on it
that says, uh,
"All the fried chicken
you want."
And you know black folks
would be on that bus
in a hurry.
Or, "All the drugs you want."
Or, "All the alcohol
you want."
Or, "All the..."
Would y'all excuse me
for a minute, please?
I'll be right back.
RACHEL:
Hey, how you doing?
How long
you gonna be out here?
As long as it takes, Rachel.
How long is that?
Probably all night.
All night?
MAN:
G-Phi-G!
MAN: We want ice.
Damn it, Grady.
Why I get
the sloppiest roommate
in school, I'll never know.
Did you have to use
the whole can?
Well, you know...
You know Grady.
I mean, uh,
he don't feel at home
unless it, uh, smells
like a locker room
in here, you know.
Yeah.
What? What's the matter?
We had static with Jane
and the Gamma Rays.
Earlier today you told me
not to let Julian bother me.
So what's up
with you and Jane, huh?
What happened, Rachel?
The usual.
Well, fuck 'em.
I don't give
two motherfucks about them.
So I don't see...
Here we go.
Here we go, where?
Don't start, all right?
What are you talking about,
"Don't start"?
I know I have
my problems with them,
but with you it's a crusade.
I'm beginning to think
you're color-struck.
You definitely have a thing
against light-skinned blacks.
Who, me?
Yes, you.
No, no, Rachel.
It's them. It's not me.
Come on, I adore octoroon
and quadroon mulattoes.
They're so unpure.
And you're 100% pure?
Massa was in your
ancestors' slave quarters
just like everybody else.
No, no, no, no.
No white blood in me.
My stock 100%
pure Zulu Masai.
Nubian knight of Bingyjoint.
You are so silly.
Hey, but on the serious tip,
some of the wannabes
are all right.
The rest suck.
If people are cool with me,
Rachel, I'm cool with them.
You're full of shit.
And you need to check
yourself on that tip.
MAN:
Oh, hold up.
My arm's going to sleep.
It's getting late.
Don't you have to go back?
I want you
to spend the night, okay?
What about Grady?
Forget Grady.
I have something
to tell you.
No, I'm not pregnant.
Oh, okay.
What?
I'm pledging
Delta next semester.
You're what?
I'm going to pledge
Delta next semester.
I've been to
a couple of rushes,
and if they accept me,
I'm gonna do it.
First it was Julian,
then it was Darrell, now you.
Everybody tripping or what?
What is this?
I don't believe this, Rachel.
Believe it.
You sure know how to spoil
a pleasant evening.
I know how to spoil
a pleasant evening?
I didn't come in here
talking about pledging
no sorority.
I must have been
sick in the head
to think
I'd have your support.
Yeah, you must have been
sick in the head,
'cause you ain't
getting my support
on nothing like that. No way.
Thought I would.
Yeah, well...
You know them
sororities are just as bad
as fraternities, Rachel.
Vaughn, this is something
that I want to do.
You have every right
not to like the Greeks
but this is another matter.
Now that's bullshit.
You haven't even
considered the good things
that they do
on campus and
in the comm...
That's bullshit, Rachel!
They change people.
You won't be the same.
People change for the worse
after they pledge.
If I seen it once,
I seen it a million times.
There's no way
you can tell me...
I'll be the same Rachel.
And I'll still love you.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.
Oh, fine.
Why don't you go
join the Gamma Rays,
while you're at it?
Okay. Now I see.
This has nothing to do
with the Gamma Rays, right?
You know, Vaughn?
I've often wondered
if the only reason
you're with me
is because I'm one
of the darkest sisters
on campus.
Good for your
all-the-way-down,
pro-black nationalist image.
Rachel. Rachel...
Hey, how are you?
What's that?
G-Phi-G, let's go!
MAN:
Hold up. Hold up.
Let's straighten this out.
Well, I see
we meet again under
unpleasant circumstances.
Dap, you are in
direct violation.
You need
a permit from my office
to participate in this parade
and you don't have one.
Dig it.
No permits, no parade.
Julian,
I can handle this myself.
Well, handle it, then.
MAN: Excuse me.
Give me the banner.
DAP:
We ain't giving you shit.
That's right,
God damn it.
We pay tuition here
just like everybody else.
Fucking wannabes
make me sick.
When will you
jigaboos ever learn
what it is to do it
by the book?
Who're you calling jigaboo?
You call people
in your family jigaboo?
Look, I am sick
of you niggers!
Every day the same shit!
Damn, Virg.
Such profanity.
"Niggers"?
EDGE:
All right, chump.
What do you
gentlemen want to do?
Kill each other?
No, no.
It's not like that at all.
You gonna kill each other?
Take the banner.
Let it go. Let it go.
Give it to him.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Can we still
follow the float?
You can follow.
Thank you.
Yeah, on the side.
Stay in the back.
Stay on the side.
Bye, Virgil.
See you, Monroe.
You happy now?
I'm very happy.
Good. Now we'll follow you
whenever you get ready.
In the back.
We'd be glad
to let you follow us.
Let's go.
Jig.
Shut up, Chucky Cheese.
I'll smack you
into next week.
Whenever you're ready.
Watch your mouth, boy.
We should kick
their ass, man.
Hold it, hold it.
Coach has something to say.
PLAYER:
Gonna win it, Coach.
Men.
We have gathered here today
to do a job.
PLAYER: Yes, sir.
God told
and explained to Jonah
that the essence of love
is to labor for something.
Yeah.
That's right.
To make something grow.
That love and labor
are inseparable.
Yes, sir.
That's right.
One loves that
for which one lives
and one labors for
that which one loves.
All right!
When we get out
on that gridiron
it's what we have
labored for all week.
All right!
Now,
I want every man to think
about his responsibilities,
his role.
This is a team
made up of 65 players
and it will
take a total effort
by a committed, dedicated,
never-say-die,
never-give-up group
of 65 individuals who have
come together as one!
ALL: Yeah!
Go! Go! Go!
We don't have
to be told, sir!
To do this job,
to win this battle.
I don't have to tell you...
No, you don't.
The stands are packed
with your friends...
Right.
...classmates, your families.
That's right.
Alumni has traveled
from near and far.
Talk to me.
I won't even mention
that your lady friends
will be watching you.
Yeah!
PLAYER:
Hear, hear.
Do you want to let them down?
Hell, no!
Do you want to make
a bad representation
of Mission College?
Hell, no!
Do you want to
lose Homecoming
for the fourth year in a row?
ALL: Hell, no!
Do you want me
to lose my job?
Hell, no!
Do you like the devil?
Hell, no!
Well, the devil is
in that other locker room!
Make us feel it.
The devil is
wearing black jerseys.
Can I get a witness?
ALL: Yes!
I want intensity!
ALL: Oh, yeah!
I want reckless abandon!
Oh, yeah!
I want you to remember that
this is Mission College!
And then,
by the name
of all that is holy,
go out there
and kick some butt!
ALL: Yeah!
COACH ODOM: Let's go!
Come on! That's the way!
It's just the first quarter.
Fire it up, Mission,
fire it up, hey!
Fire it up, Mission,
fire it up, hey!
All right, defense!
All right, steady!
Hold them!
Hey! Where's the blocking?
CHEERLEADERS: Tigers!
Tigers!
Come on, man!
Red, right, red, right!
This doesn't look good.
Mission never says die.
Yo, yo,
what the fuck is going on?
I've been here four years.
We've lost every Homecoming.
You play like
a bunch of pussies.
Man, down in the front!
Take your hat, your coat,
and leave, motherfucker!
Whoever said that shit
ain't got no mother, man.
McPHERSON: Vaughn Dunlap.
Yeah, President McPherson.
How'd you get the name
"Dap"?
Just a nickname. That's all.
Anyway, Vaughn,
you've been a good student
these past four years
and you've grown
into a fine young man.
Thank you, sir.
That's why I'm so surprised
at your recent activities.
Activities?
You've become
a disruptive force
on this campus.
You're hindering other folks
from an education.
Let me make it plain.
Hey, man, you don't
really have a choice.
If you continue these antics,
you'll be expelled.
Plain and simple,
short and sweet.
This is Cedar Cloud,
Chairman of
the Board of Trustees.
What he says is true.
True?
With all due respect,
President McPherson,
I don't believe
this man knows
the meaning of the word.
So what?
You marched with King
in the '60s. Big deal.
That was over 20 years ago.
Black people are
still catching hell
all over the world, you know.
Sit down, son.
We have made progress.
Says who?
There is no way
you can defend
not divesting completely.
No ifs, ands
or buts about it.
It's your program
we don't like.
You cannot
hinder other students
from getting an education.
I'll do what I have to do.
So will I.
You know... Look at me!
You've got a lot
of living to do.
I had classmates
here at Mission
just like you.
And now
they're old and bitter.
You still don't understand,
do you?
Make us understand.
Is there anything else?
McPHERSON: You may go.
Thank you.
We'll be watching you.
You do that.
Sorry about the game, man.
Hey, that's all right, man.
We gave it the old
Mission College try, right?
No, we didn't.
So I lied.
We got stomped, man.
What was the score?
What, 52-7?
I don't know, man.
I was looking at the honeys
in the fourth quarter, man.
Hey, Rachel call, man?
Not since I've been here.
DORIS:
Bet you it's Dap.
Let him call.
Miss Life, does that
sound like the president
of the Dap Dunlap
Fan Club to you?
It does not to me,
Witherspoon.
RACHEL:
Well, the president
handed in her resignation.
I told him about me pledging
and he went off on me.
Did I hear right, Rachel?
Yeah.
Did I just hear that
you're going to pledge?
Thanks for telling us.
It's a big surprise.
It shouldn't be a surprise.
I've always wanted to pledge.
DORIS:
Since when?
Since I got here.
Oh, since you got here.
That's great.
So now you feel you have
to belong to something.
You have to go up
and join up
with some people, huh?
The Gamma Rays
have certainly
gotten to you.
Come on, y'all.
I have a sense of who I am.
Then why wait
till your senior year?
Yeah.
I was afraid of what
Dap would think of me.
What Dap would think of you?
Well,
I'm glad you came around.
'Cause these boys
will run your life.
Just give them one chance.
Dap, the word is out, brother.
DAP: Hmm?
McPherson called you
in on the carpet.
Dag, man.
Who told you, man?
You can't hide nothing
from your boys, man.
Holding out on us again,
huh?
BOOKER T:
So what's up with that?
McPherson is on me
about the South African thing,
man.
What'd I tell you?
You see?
I knew it. I knew it.
Uh-huh. What else?
I know there's more.
What else?
He threatened me
with expulsion.
They're talking
about kicking me
out of school.
Man, that isn't no threat.
That's a promise.
That ain't no joke.
I doubt it.
Anyway, look.
Y'all supposed
to be my boys, right?
ALL: Right.
And we all agree
that Mission
has to divest, right?
Right?
Yeah.
All right, then, that's it.
We got to do something,
something big.
I don't know what it is yet.
But it's got to be something
to let McPherson,
the administration,
and the world know
that we won't have no part
to this apartheid thing.
Hey, look, I need y'all, man.
The rest of these
okey-doke Negroes
is too worried
about graduating
and getting
a Brooks Brothers suit.
But y'all, I need your back.
Hey, look,
if you all ain't down,
you all just another bunch
of foot-shuffling, wannabe
white Uncle Toms,
as far as I'm concerned.
Dap, man.
You know I love you
like my brother, man,
but, I mean,
what is wrong with wanting
to have a nice job?
I don't think
anything's wrong.
Yo, man, my daddy,
my mama, they slaved
all their damn life
to send my black ass
to school.
DAP:
Do you think I got bank?
Hey, I'm not finished, man.
I'll be the first one
in my family to go to college.
I mean, Dap, man,
do you realize
what that means?
I mean, the first one ever.
And all my family
has always been
sharecroppers since slavery.
Man, apartheid is slavery.
You can do
what you want to do, Dap.
I ain't throwing it away
for nobody.
Not you, not Bishop Tutu,
not even Jesus Christ himself.
Come on. Let's go.
DAP: Come on, y'all.
Don't leave me hanging.
Dap, you need to
lighten up, man.
Seriously.
Stay out of trouble.
Hey, hey,
McPherson is bluffing, y'all.
Dap, in life there are times
to be quiet, man,
to shut the fuck up.
This is one of them.
That's the way
it's going to be, huh?
That's the way
it is right now, bro.
Bet. That's a bet.
Later for you
cheese-eating niggers.
Fuck you all.
Hey, yo, why we got
to be all that, Dap?
You need to max out, man.
What do you two-faced,
backstabbing bastards want?
We want to know,
do revolutionaries
eat Kentucky Fried Chicken?
Uh, excuse me, Book.
Let me ask you
just one question,
my brother.
What?
Book.
When are you going to get this
goddamn raggedy car fixed,
man?
Now, what's wrong with it,
man?
I mean, it runs
like a stocking, man.
And furthermore, you know,
you wouldn't believe
how many women I done boned
in that there back seat.
Man, you got to
get a new word, man.
You're running "boning" dead.
Like what?
Like, uh, "blend."
Try "blend."
No more boning.
Try "blend."
Bet. Bet. Hey.
You wouldn't believe
how many women
I done blended in that
back seat right there.
Aw, you're right.
We wouldn't believe it.
Never let it be...
I said, never let it be said
that Booker T. Washington
did not satisfy a woman.
Man, I lays much pipe.
Yeah, you're just
like the Roto-Rooter.
Liquid-Plumr.
Check it out.
If you have so many women,
how come it is
that we ain't seen you
with one, not one?
Not naming names.
I got to graduate.
Is that all you guys
think about? Is that it?
You damn skippy.
Monroe, my man,
my man, talk to me.
What do you want us
to think about?
World affairs.
The trickle-down theory.
Who's gonna win
the Super Bowl?
I just get tired of y'all
always talking about women.
Women.
Well, you ought
to try it sometime.
Yo, man,
it beats singing.
That's right,
God damn it.
That's another thing.
What's another thing?
Shut up, man.
Why don't you learn
how to articulate,
you juvenile delinquents?
ALL:
Shut up, man.
You turnstile-hopping...
Shut up!
Welcome to
Kentucky Fried Chicken.
May I help you, please?
You know what?
I think we should
eat somewhere else.
Yeah, let me have
a two-piece meal with fries.
GRADY:
Yeah, two-piece,
all white with fries.
Right, so make that
three two-piece with fries
and a Colonel's meal.
White meat or dark?
DAP: You want white meat?
GRADY:
I want white meat.
He wants white meat.
We don't have any
white meat today.
Then why did you ask?
So, Monroe,
I'll give you that $30 back
next week, man.
Yeah, right.
Book,
you got any salt down there?
All right.
Excuse me, brothers.
Think I can borrow
the salt from y'all?
We ain't finished.
So I said to the bitch,
"Look, you don't come to me
with no shit like that."
So when do you think
you'll be finished?
What time it is?
Later for them, man.
I ain't thinking
about them suckers.
LEEDS:
Yoo-hoo.
Look, don't start
no shit, all right?
Just let them go.
Yoo-hoo. Over here.
What? What do you want, man?
Do you boys go to Mission?
Yeah.
Is it true what they say
about Mission men?
Hey, Grady, man, no.
Let's go.
Hey, yo, fuck them.
We've already paid
the money for this...
Yeah, yeah. I know it.
Let's go. Come on.
No, man.
I ain't finished eating
my chicken yet, man.
Hey, yo, why we gotta...
For them suckers, man?
EDGE:
Yo, Dap, hold up!
Yo, Dap, man!
Yo, Dap, chill for a minute.
Squash it, Edge.
Hey, yo, Dap, come on, man.
Don't do that.
Squash it.
Yo, Missionaries.
The jheri curl
is popping shit.
Missionettes.
Ready-for-the-world
is popping shit.
Come on. Man,
what's up with that?
Yeah, brother.
What do you want?
You ain't no kin to me.
That's right,
and we ain't your brothers.
How come you
college motherfuckers
think you all run everything?
Is there a problem here?
Big problems.
I heard that.
You come to our town
year after year
and take over.
We was born here,
gonna be here
and gonna die here
and can't find jobs
'cause of you.
Yeah. Right.
Now can we go?
Okay, can we just go?
I mean, we may not
have your education,
but we ain't dirt,
neither.
And ain't nobody said
all of that, all right?
You Mission punks
are always
talking down to us.
Look, Brother,
I'm real sorry that
you feel that way, okay?
I'm really sorry about that.
Are you black?
Take a look in the mirror,
man.
Look, you got
a legitimate beef, all right,
but it ain't with us, okay?
Are you black?
Look, man,
don't ever question the fact
whether I'm black.
In fact, I was going to ask
your country-bama ass
why you got them
drip-drip chemicals
in your hair.
That's right,
God damn it.
And then come out in public
with a shower cap
on your head.
Like a fucking bitch.
MOSES:
Who you calling a bitch,
bitch?
Well, if the shoe fit...
You know, I bet you niggers
do think y'all are white.
College don't mean shit.
Y'all are niggers,
and you going to
be niggers forever.
Just like us.
Niggers.
You're not niggers.
Come on, man.
Fuck you up.
Get the fuck out of here
before I bust a cap
in your young college ass.
Go on.
Wait, wait a minute.
You know what?
I don't really
want to believe that,
I mean, but do we really
act like that?
My name's Bennett.
I ain't even in it.
No, no, but you know, what
the guys were saying about us.
That my name's Paul,
and that's just
between y'all.
Yo, man,
we're not wannabes.
They were ignorant.
I don't know, guys.
I don't think so.
Look, man,
motherfuckers got to start
and try and better
theirself, man,
just like we're trying to do.
Dig it.
Maybe they've tried it,
and they've just given up.
Yeah, that's the deal, man.
You think
everything's so damn easy,
don't you, Grady?
Hell, yeah.
You work or you starve.
I want to eat sirloin.
Then the guy
was right, man.
I know the guy was right.
I told you.
What do he know?
He knows a lot.
So, like,
do you think that maybe
you could drive any faster?
I'm going to be late
for glee club.
"I'm going to be late
for glee club."
See, you guys are
like picking on me.
ALL: No!
No man, you our boy, man.
Hey, baby.
Hey, baby.
Hey, baby.
Hey, baby.
She's got a beard,
motherfucker.
She looks just like your mama
and shit, man.
At least my mama
ain't got no beard
on the back of her neck.
Your mama got two titties
on the back of her neck
and shit.
Yo, Jordan, Jordan.
What?
I heard your mom held
Kareem to 15 points.
The newspaper said
your mama playing
fullback for the Hefty Hos
and shit.
That's all right, man.
At least she's starting, man.
Your mama
coming off the bench.
That's right.
She's a four-letter man.
Oh, shut up.
Your head can be
used like a knife.
Shut up.
Ginsu II.
Yo, when Booker comes,
he's gotta come twice
'cause his back of
his head is thick enough
for two people.
So, anyway, Booker,
look, man...
Wait a minute.
There's Julian.
JORDAN:
That shit wasn't funny, man.
BOOKER T:
So what, man?
I ain't stopping, man.
No. You are stopping,
'cause I've gotta talk to him.
Pull over, Book.
Let the boy alone, man.
We'll wait, man.
We'll wait.
Bye, Monroe.
Hey.
Um...
Look, I got...
I gotta talk to you
about something and, um...
Well, Jane,
could you excuse us,
please?
Jane,
just give me a moment, okay?
She your
bodyguard now, too?
So, uh, how you doing?
Just fine, Vaughn.
Look, man, um,
you're the dean
of pledgees.
You're president
of the chapter, right?
Now, my cousin...
Tomorrow,
he's gonna be
a Gamma man.
You're going to
see to this, okay?
Look, I know you know
better than to threaten me.
I'm shaking.
Hey, look, Julian, man.
You're a simple,
weak motherfucker,
but that's besides the point.
Listen, if you fuck Half-Pint,
I fuck you.
Oh, is that right?
Well, let me tell
you something.
I am a Greek,
and I don't play that.
Now, I'll deal with Half-Pint,
after which
you and me
are gonna come to blows.
So, what? You wanna
rock and roll right now?
Hey, man, I'm here.
Julian, forget him.
He's not worth it.
What's with
the bodyguard, man?
You talk more shit
than a little bit.
"Back to Mother Africa."
That's bullshit!
Without question,
we are all black Americans.
You do not know
a goddamn thing
about Africa.
I am from Detroit, Motown.
So, you can
Watusi your monkey ass
back to Africa
if you want to.
Boy, you need to check
that alarm clock
and wake up, my brother.
Move over, jigaboo!
MAN:
Gammites!
GAMMITES:
Presenting the great men
of Gamma Phi Gamma.
Go, team!
Gamma Rays!
Gamma!
Gamma!
Gamma!
Gamma!
Gamma!
Gamma!
Hoo!
WOMAN:
Don't stop! Don't stop!
G-Phi-G.
G-Phi!
Gamma!
GAMMA RAYS:
We are
G-Phi-G!
G-Phi!
G-Phi!
G-Phi-G!
We, the brothers
of Fellas-Phi-Fellas
who are the baddest
motherfuckers on this campus.
Not the Alphas!
Not the Kappas!
Or the Q's.
And definitely
not the Gamma dogs.
ALL:
You damn skippy.
So this is for you.
Hit it!
Let's get out of here, Fellas.
Here we go.
WOMAN:
Get off! Stop it!
Get your hands off me, man!
Get off me!
Get off me, man!
Damn! Those funky bastards
are gonna pay!
Payback is a dead Fella.
Damn right!
I say we kick
their ass tonight.
No. We kick it now.
JULIAN:
Just calm down! Calm down!
Look, everybody just relax.
Tonight is the Death March,
for those of you
who have forgotten.
Now, please,
let's try to adhere
to the rules and regulations
as so stated
in your Gamma Good Book.
Oh, shit, man.
I was just getting accustomed
to whipping some ass.
Julian, till next semester
is a long time to wait
for some of the boys.
I understand
that you want to strike blows
in the name of Gamma.
But discretion is the key,
so use it.
Look, all we need
is to be put
on probation again.
Is that understood?
Patton, do you understand?
Yes.
Good.
Now, the Gamma Rays
will be giving a set
after the Gammites go over.
That's if they go over.
Your attendance is mandatory.
Look, we'll be there, okay?
But on a serious tip,
Julian, it's time
for some new Gamma Rays.
What's wrong
with the Gamma Rays?
You ain't complaining,
'cause you got the best one.
Who, me?
Yeah, you.
Jane is good to go.
The finest, brother.
Look, look, brothers, look.
Jane and I just
aren't making it, okay?
I mean, she's just
too young, that's all,
and it's just wearing on me.
So, uh...
Well,
what I'm trying to say is, uh,
I'm going to cut her loose.
You're illing, man.
After tonight,
whoever wants her
can have her.
Patton got dibs.
Oh, no. Wait a second.
Yo, Rachel.
That'd be me.
DAP: Yo.
Hey.
Rachel.
Come on,
I know you're up there.
Lizzie, turn that out.
What for?
Will you just turn it out?
DAP: Rachel.
Yo, Rachel!
Rachel, you've lost
your mind, you know.
Come on, I know
you're up there, Rachel.
Come on down, please.
Yo, Rachel. Yo.
Rachel!
CECILIA:
Beg for it!
Get on your knees!
WOMAN:
Y'all be quiet!
Hey, Rachel,
I'm sorry, all right?
Oh, poor baby.
Now you're sorry again.
But it's going to
cost you this time.
If you want to pledge,
that's okay, all right?
I mean...
Oh, but, no, see?
If I were Rachel,
you would be in a doghouse.
Yes, but you ain't Rachel,
Miss Thing.
And speaking of dogs,
with a face like yours,
you should be in a kennel.
Oh, but see,
we're not even
talking about faces.
Because yours is cracked
and on the ground.
CECILIA:
There it is.
Right there. Pick it up.
Would you please be quiet?
"Be quiet"?
Who's screaming
at the top of their lungs
in front of my window?
And you look too pitiful.
Hey, yo.
Yo, Rachel, look.
I wouldn't be
standing out here
taking this abuse
if I didn't
care about you, you know.
"If I didn't care."
Oh, please. Girl,
don't believe a word.
Honey, he's just
lying through his teeth.
Girlfriend, listen.
He'll say anything
to get back in.
Hey, you.
Shut the fuck up.
No, you didn't.
Oh, yes, I did.
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
Wait a minute.
Don't get nasty.
Honey, look at him.
He's no different.
He just wants one thing.
They all do, girl.
The panties.
CECILIA:
I know that's right.
Yo, Rachel, you know,
I ain't got to be here
taking all of this stuff
all night, you know.
I could be at home.
I got better things to do.
Get out of here, boy.
WOMEN:
Go home.
Come on, Rachel.
Will you please come down here
and talk to me, please?
CECILIA:
Good for you!
TINA:
That's your bath for tonight.
So it's going to
be like that, huh? Okay.
Fine.
I love you, too.
But fuck it.
You win. I'm going home.
GIRL:
See you later.
Dap.
Dap.
You're soaked.
Yeah, it's funny, huh?
You got
a great bunch of friends.
I apologize, Rachel.
I'm sorry. I was wrong.
Look, I apologize.
Do you forgive me?
Come on. Please.
Look at me.
I'm a mess. Look at this.
Come on.
I forgive you.
Thank you.
But you have to stop
being so judgmental.
What?
You are too hard on folks.
Give us mere mortals
a chance sometimes.
Don't be so quick to judge.
I don't judge.
Well, you know,
not exactly.
I mean,
there is right and wrong,
you know.
Right and wrong?
Right.
Wrong.
Come on. Let's get you
in some dry clothes.
Damn. Hold still.
Oh. Oh, it tickles.
Tickles right there.
Don't get
new on me, okay?
Thank you
very much, Rachel.
Sisters were right, huh?
No, no, no,
I'm okay. Really.
I'll be cool, okay?
Good.
Just hold me.
Gamma!
JULIAN:
When the gong calls,
the quest begins
to the land
of Gamma Phi Gamma.
Keep your beacons
from touching the ground,
or you shall perish.
CHUCKY:
Watch the eternal lantern.
Never let it
out of your sight.
JULIAN:
Gamma!
GIRLS:
G-Phi-G. G-Phi-G.
G-Phi-G. G-Phi-G.
YODA:
We are going to make it
to Gamma Land!
G-Phi-G.
Gamma will break you! Gamma!
Let's go, get fired up!
I want Gamma! I want Gamma!
Gamma!
Fucking six weeks
of pledging shit!
Fucking six weeks!
Oh, shit.
GIRLS: G-Phi-G.
So you want to
be a Gamma dog?
My fresh is doing it right.
He's doing it right.
Hang it up!
Don't give up now.
You've come too far.
No, Half-Pint, no.
Look, I got it. Half-Pint,
just rest, okay? I got it.
Yo, ladies, ladies, ladies.
Let his arm go, okay?
He's got to make it
on his own.
Come on, Dr. Feelgood,

Get to the back

You forget I helped

Slim Daddy, old pal, huh?
Fine.
How you doing? What?
What? What? What?
Fine. Fine. Fine.
Okay. I was just
gonna ask you something.
Um, this torch here
seems like it's getting
a little heavy for you.
You trembling and shit, huh?
No.
What?
No.
What?
No!
Big Brother Dr. Feelgood.
Slim Daddy, wait.
How long you been on line?
Six weeks.
How long you been on line?
Six weeks.
Wrong.
How long you been on line?
Six weeks. Six weeks,
two days, 15 hours,
37 minutes,
and if I had a watch,
Big Brother,
17, 18, 19 seconds,
Big Brother Lance.
You want to quit, don't you?
I do not want to quit!
Half-Pint,
I don't like you.
I like you,
General Jig-Boy Patton.
What did you call me?
What's my name?
You've got big Coke bottles
on your face.
Half-Pint, what happened?
What's it say?
What's it say? Read it.
Read it and weep.
Read it.
G-Phi-G!
Half-Pint, you a virgin?
No, I'm not!
Half-Pint, you a virgin?
No, I'm not!
Name me two girls you've had.
Two. Quick.
Come on, man. Quick.
Quick.
Quick.
Quick.
That's 'cause
you ain't had none.
That's why
you can't think of none.
Come on, man.
Susie Mae in high school.
Oh, man. Only thing
you had in high school
was acne and sore nuts.
And that's one.
Half-Pint, you're not
going to be a Gamma man.
I will make it.
I will be a Gamma man!
GIRL: Leave him alone.
Look, Half-Pint, why don't
you put the torch down?
I will never put it down.
Put the torch down.
No!
You know what happened
to the last number one
that told Patton "no"?
You ain't no good.
VELDA:
Why don't you leave
Half-Pint alone?
Look. Y'all get out of here.
No!
Move!
No!
Don't listen to them.
Don't listen.
You're almost home.
Gamma Rays!
Gamma!
Gamma!
JULIAN:
Lift your torches
to the heavens!
GAMMITES:
We of the eternal lantern,
guiding us through
the misty mist
and the dusty dust,
on the straight
and narrow path,
righter of the wrong,
protector of the weak,
from the nipple
to the bottle,
Gamma Phi Gamma!
Kiss my nuts!
'Cause I'm a Gamma man!
This is your night, brother.
I'm telling you,
this is your night.
We gonna hook you up
personally.
Look, do me a favor.
Hold this for me.
I'm gonna hook you up, man.
I'm telling you.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm telling you.
We'll be right back.
Let the games begin, brother.
That's right.
CROWD:
Well, you did it.
I'm proud of you.
Just remember one thing,
Big Brother Half-Pint.
Now you belong
to my family.
Welcome home.
Gamma.
G-Phi-G.
I couldn't help
but notice you
in this bathing suit.
You look...
Nice, real nice.
You know what I thought about
when I first saw you?
Collard greens
and corn bread,
I ain't gonna lie to you.
And Wilson Pickett.
I mean, you got,
like, one of them
bodies, baby.
Hey, uh,
do you go swimming often?
I can't swim a lick
and I'm a Pisces.
Ain't that a trip?
What's your sign?
No, don't tell me.
Let me guess.
Virgo. No, no, no.
I'm getting
Capricorn vibes from you.
Do you love me?
Yes.
Do you really love
Gamma Phi Gamma?
Yes.
Well, you're going
to have to prove it.
I love you.
Gamma men!
Chucky.
Brothers,
tonight is Half-Pint's night.
Look, I told your cousin
I was going to
take care of you.
So that's what I'm gonna do.
Dean Big Brother Almighty.
What are you talking about?
Look, tonight,
I'm going to give you
a very, very special gift
from me...
to you.
No, no.
That's out.
Look, look, I told you
I wasn't pledging no virgins.
You're a Gamma man now.
It's time for you
to become a real man.
Go, go, go, go!
I like that.
I like to have a little fun.
Go, go, go!
Go, go, go!
Shut up!
Half-Pint,
you wear her out
like a natural
Gamma man.
GAMMITE: Gamma dog!
GAMMITE 2:
First time I've wished
I was Half-Pint.
Shut up!
MAN: Yo, you gotta
have a dick.
GAMMITE 2:
Yes.
GAMMITE:
Meow.
Shit.
You're a Gamma man now.
Prove that
I did the right thing
by letting you go over.
Prove it.
Work it.
Want to borrow one
of my prophylactics?
GAMMITE 3:
Do it, dude.
Definitely...
I said shut up, damn it!
Jane,
we don't got to do this.
Shut up
and get undressed.
Come here.
Grady, I'm hungry.
Can we go get some food?
I've got food in my room.
What you want?
I got some Vienna sausage.
I got me some
Underwood Deviled Ham,
some sardines,
some Premium
Saltine Crackers.
I got all that.
No. You're so country.
I want some real food.
Oh. Oh, oh, Lord.
Oh, my knee done
went out on me again.
What happened?
You all right?
Oh, I banged it up.
I banged it up today.
I'll tell you what.
You take me
to get some food,
and I'll rub it.
Yeah.
Is your roommate in?
No. I got the room to myself.
Okay,
because I need my privacy.
Yo, did you hear that?
I ain't heard nothing.
Shh.
There it is again.
Homeboy's doing okay.
Yeah.
GAMMITE:
He's doing the Gamma slammer.
GAMMITE 2:
There it is.
GAMMITE 3:
Work it.
One of y'all. Could you...
Could you take Doris, please?
Ain't nothing
wrong with Doris, man.
She's the only woman on campus
that could look up to you.
That's right.
What you talking about?
Don't you feel good?
Damn, you ain't
needing a girl anyway, man.
Stop crying.
Excuse me.
Move, man.
Move out of the way.
Don't you see
a lady present?
What's up, dude?
How are you gentlemen
this fine night?
Y'all have a restful sleep.
I knew you was a Taurus.
You look so good,
you ought to be on
you know that?
I'm going to put you
on baby.
Mmm, mmm. Mmm, mmm.
Looky here,
looky here, looky here.
Come on over here, girl.
Grady, we're not alone.
That ain't nothing
but a lumpy mattress, baby.
That's your roommate in here.
If you be quiet,
they'll never even know.
I'm a silent lover, baby,
and if you don't scream,
I sure won't holler.
Will you let go?
Baby. Come on.
Get off me.
Are you crazy?
No. You crazy.
You call me
when you get it together.
Hey, baby, you almost
stepped on my sneakers!
I'll call you in the morning.
Thanks for walking me
back to my room.
I appreciate it.
That was quick.
She sure left
in a huff, homeboy.
I heard of premature,
man, but shit...
That's right,
God damn it.
You made it kind of quick.
Fuck all y'all!
Bye, Quick Draw McGraw.
Monroe would've been in there
longer than that.
Yeah, I...
I would've been in there
longer than that.
Shut up.
Damn. How long
that motherfucker
been in there?
I'm going in there.
She might've killed the boy.
No.
Half-Pint!
Half-Pint! Half-Pint!
DOUBLE RUBBER:
So, Half-Pint, how was it?
MUSTAFA:
Was it like
you had imagined it?
DOO-DOO BREATH:
Or dreamed about?
From now on,
we're going to
call you Full-Pint.
Speech! Speech!
Lots of pressure, Pint.
Wait, wait, wait.
Just let me walk Jane
to her car, okay?
That's all I want to do.
Then I'll come back
and tell you everything.
You the man, dude.
You the man.
Don't flatter yourself.
Half-Pint,
it wasn't for you.
Gamma men,
it's been a good night.
I'll see you all
in the morning.
Dog, good time.
Good night.
Good for Half-Pint.
We're out of here.
Big dog.
GAMMITE:
I, uh, did what you said.
Oh, yes?
And what was that?
I did it.
You what?
You told me.
Wait a minute.
You gave it up
to Half-Pint?
Yeah.
You gave it up?
How could you do this, Jane?
You told me.
How could you do this?
You boning
my own frat brother?
No, I didn't tell you that.
The hell I told you that!
What?
Jane, I thought
you loved me.
I do love you.
No. You don't love me.
No. No, you love
what I stand for.
You love Gamma Phi Gamma.
Julian.
No.
You're in love with Dean
Big Brother Almighty.
No, that's not true!
You don't even see
Julian anymore, Jane.
How could you do this?
Why are you doing this to me?
How could you?
Why am I...
Why are you doing this to me?
You are blinded
by the black and silver.
No, Jane.
Jane, I'm sorry.
I only wanted to love you.
Jane, you're wrong.
You're wrong, Jane.
I've been trying
to tell you this
for so long.
No!
No. No. I am...
Jane, I am not
here for you anymore.
I want to tell you
something.
This was your final test.
Your final test.
And you failed, Jane.
Jane, you blew it.
You blew it. I'm sorry.
What can I do?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Jane.
Please.
Julian.
Dap!
Dap! Open the door!
Dap!
Are you out
of your fucking mind?
I got to see Dap.
I got to see my cousin.
It's a motherfucking 5:00
in the motherfucking morning.
Dap!
Get him up, then.
He's sleeping. I'm sleeping.
MAN: Fuck y'all, man!
Yeah. Okay.
Get him up.
Right.
Dap!
Dap, open up.
I know you're in there.
Come on. Open up.
Dap, come on.
What's the matter, man?
You okay?
I'm okay. Let me in.
No. Rachel's sleeping.
She's always
sleeping over here, man.
Yeah.
What do you want, Darrell?
Let me in.
Rachel's sleeping.
What do you want, Darrell?
Check this out.
I'm over. A Gamma man.
Oh, shit.
A Gamma man.
All right. Congratulations.
You didn't think
I was gonna make it.
No, I thought
you was gonna make it.
Nah, you didn't.
No, okay. Congratulations.
You're right.
I didn't think
you was gonna make it.
Congratulations.
I'm sorry.
It takes a real man
to be a Gamma man
'cause only a Gamma man...
Yo, calm down. Calm down.
G-Phi-G! Guess what.
Yo, be quiet.
What, what, what, what?
Ain't no virgin no more.
Really?
Yeah.
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold up. Hold up.
When did this
minor miracle occur?
Tonight.
Tonight's my night.
No shit?
Guess who.
Who?
Jane.
Yeah, right.
Jane Toussaint, right?
Fine-ass Jane.
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
You fucked Julian's girl?
Big Brother Almighty
hooked the shit up.
It was good.
Julian's girl, huh?
Yo, cuz, I fucked the girl
like a Gamma man should.
Yeah, I bet you did.
Come on, Dap!
What's wrong with you?
Get off me, Dap!
What the fuck is wrong
with you, Darrell?
I just got this
sweater tonight, man!
You lucky you got
your life now, man.
Get off me!
Why did you do that?
You're just like
the rest of them!
Dap, get off of me.
Get the fuck out
of my face, man.
You're not my cousin no more.
No, I'm not your cousin
no more.
That bunch of
pussy-school privates
is your family now.
That's right,
I'm a Gamma man.
And I'm calling
your mother
and I'm telling her
what you did.
It takes a real man
to be a Gamma man...
It takes a real
fucking asshole
to do what you did.
Gamma!
Get the fuck out of here.
Where you going?
Out.
Wait for me.
Grady. Grady, wake up.
What?
What the fuck
is going on tonight?
Damn.
Wake up!
Hey, Jordan, wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up, come on.
Come on, wake up. Wake up.
DAP: Wake up!
Wake up!
