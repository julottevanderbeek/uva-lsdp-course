Their Royal Highnesses...
-Ahh.
-Oh.
The little darling.
FAlRlES: Your Majesties.
Each of us
the child may bless...
with a single gift...
no more, no less.
Little Princess,
my gift shall be...
the gift of beauty.
Tiny Princess...
my gift shall be
the gift of song.
Sweet Princess,
my gift shall be the...
What does she want here?
Shhh.
Well...
Quite a glittering
assemblage, King Stefan.
Royalty, nobility,
the gentry, and--
ah ha ha ha ha--
how quaint.
Ooooh.
l really felt
quite distressed...
at not receiving
an invitation.
You weren't wanted.
Not wa--ah ha.
Oh, dear,
what an awkward situation.
Well, in that event,
l'd best be on my way.
And...
you're not offended,
Your Excellency?
Why, no, Your Majesty...
and to show l bear
no ill will...
l, too, shall bestow
a gift on the child.
Listen well, all of you.
The Princess shall indeed
grow in grace and beauty...
beloved by all
who know her.
But...
before the sun sets
on her sixteenth birthday...
she shall prick her finger...
Oh, no!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Stand back, you fools!
Don't despair,
Your Majesties.
Merryweather still has
her gift to give.
Then she can undo
this fearful curse?
Oh, no, sire.
Maleficent's powers
are far too great.
But she can help.
But...
Sweet Princess...
Oh, silly...
Now, come have a nice
cup of tea, dear.
l'm sure it will
work out somehow.
Well, a bonfire won't
stop Maleficent.
Of course not,
but what will?
Reason?
With Maleficent?
Well, she can't be
all bad.
Oooh. l'd like to turn her
into a fat, old hop toad.
Now, dear, that isn't
a very nice thing to say.
You know our magic
doesn't work that way.
lt can only do good, dear...
to bring joy and happiness.
Well,  would
make me happy.
But there must be some way.
But there must be some way.
There is!
There is?
What is it, Flora?
l'm going to...
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.
Even walls have ears.
Follow me.
l'll turn her into a flower.
Maleficent?
No, no, dear, the Princess.
Oh, she'd make
a lovely flower.
Don't you see?
A flower can't prick its finger.
lt hasn't any.
That's right.
Until Maleficent
sends a frost.
Yes. Er...
Oh, dear.
She always ruins
your nicest flowers.
You're right...
and she'll be expecting us
to do something like that.
Oooh.
Well, what won't she expect?
She knows everything.
Oh, but she doesn't, dear.
Maleficent doesn't know
anything about love...
or kindness or the joy
of helping others.
That's it.
Of course.
lt's the only thing
she can't understand...
and won't expect.
Oh!
Now, now, now...
we have to plan it carefully.
Of course, the King and Queen
will object...
About the three peasant women
raising a foundling child...
deep in the forest.
Oh?
Well, that's very nice of them.
Who are they?
Turn around.
-Why, it's us!
-Uh-huh.
You mean we us?
Uh-huh.
Take care of the baby?
Well, y-yes, but we'd have
to feed it--
And wash it and dress it
and rock it to sleep.
Oh, l'd love it.
You really think we can?
lf humans can do it,
so can we.
And we'd have
our magic to help us.
No, no, no,
no, no, no!
No magic.
l'll take those wands
right now.
Oh, better get rid
of those wings, too.
You mean live like mortals?
For sixteen years?
But now--now
we don't know how.
We've never done anything
without magic.
And that's why Maleficent
will never suspect.
But who'll wash and cook?
Oh, we'll all pitch in.
l'll take care of the baby.
Let me have it, dear.
Come along, now.
We must tell
Their Majesties at once.
lt's incredible!
Sixteen years,
and not a trace of her!
Are you sure
you searched everywhere?
Yeah, yeah, uh...
Everywhere--we all did.
Yeah! Yeah!
And what about the town?
The forest? The mountains?
Uh, we check mountains...
uh--uh, forest...
Uh, houses and, uh,
let me see, uh...
and all the cradles.
Cradles?
Uh, yep, yep.
Ha ha ha ha.
Every cradle.
Cradle?!
Did you hear that, my pet?
All these years...
Oh, ha ha ha!
Fools!
-Aaah!
-Aaah!
Ooh! Ooh!
Ouch! Ouch!
Ahhh.
Oh, they're hopeless...
a disgrace
to the forces of evil.
Oh, my pet.
You are my last hope.
Circle far and wide.
Search for a maid of sixteen,
with hair of sunshine gold...
and lips red as the rose.
Go, and do not fail me.
Well, now,
how about this one?
This is the one l picked.
Ooh, she'll look
beautiful in that.
Now, l thought
a few changes here.
Uh-huh.
Don't forget a pretty bow.
Yes, and raise
the shoulder line.
We'll make it blue.
Oh, no, dear, pink.
Of course, we'll need
a few pleats.
Well.
-Up to?
-Up to?
Up to? Er, er...
We--we want you
to pick some berries.
That's it--berries.
-Berries?
-Lots of berries.
But l picked berries yesterday.
FLORA: Oh, we need more, dear.
FAUNA: Lots, lots more.
But don't go too far.
And don't speak to strangers.
l wonder if she suspected.
Of course not.
Come on.
Oh, will she be surprised.
A real birthday party...
with a real birthday cake.
Yes, and a dress
a Princess can be proud of.
l'll get the wands.
the wands?
Oh, no!
But the sixteen years
are almost over.
We're taking no chances.
But l've never baked
a fancy cake.
Oh, you won't have to, dear.
l'm going to bake the cake.
You?
Oh, she's always
wanted to, dear...
and this is her last chance.
Well...
l'm going to make it
fifteen layers...
with pink and blue
forget-me-nots.
And l'm making the dress.
But you can't sew,
and she's never cooked.
Oh, ho, ho, it's simple.
All you do is follow the book.
Up here, dear.
You can be the dummy.
Well, l still say
we ought to use magic.
Dee dee dee deedle um
La da da
''Flour, 3 cups.''
Cups, cups, cups, cups,
cups, cups, cups.
Oh.
Dee da dee da da dum
What's that for?
Well, it's got to have
a hole in the bottom.
lt's pink.
Oh, lovely shade, isn't it?
But l wanted it blue.
Now, dear...
we decided pink was her color.
''Two eggs, fold in gently.''
Fold?
Oh, well.
l can't breathe!
Get me out of here!
lt looks awful.
That's because
it's on you, dear.
''Now yeast, 1 tsp.''
Tsp?
One teaspoon.
One teaspoon! Of course!
Oh, gracious!
How that child has grown!
Oh, it seems only yesterday
we brought her here.
Just a tiny baby.
Why, Merryweather!
Whatever is the matter, dear?
After today,
she'll be a Princess...
and we won't have
any Briar Rose.
Oh, Flora!
Now, now, now, now.
W-we--we all knew
this day had to come.
But why did it have
to come so soon?
After all...
we've had her for sixteen years.
Sixteen wonderful years.
Good gracious!
We're acting like
a lot of ninnies!
Come on! She'll be back
before we get started.
Do you hear that, Samson?
Beautiful!
What is it?
Come on. Let's find out.
Aw, come on.
For an extra bucket of oats?
And a few...carrots?
Hup, boy!
No carrots.
Oh, dear.
Why do they still
treat me like a child?
Whoo!
Aunt Flora, Aunt Fauna...
They never want me
to meet anyone.
But you know something?
l fooled them.
l have met someone.
Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo!
Oh...a Prince.
Well, he's tall
and handsome and...
and so romantic!
Oh, we walk together
and talk together...
and just before
we say good-bye...
he takes me in his arms...
And then...
l wake up.
it's sure to come true.
And l've seen him
so many times.
there's something strange
about that voice.
Too beautiful to be real.
a...a wood sprite or a...
Your Highness.
You know, l'm really
not supposed...
to speak to strangers...
but we've met before.
BRlAR ROSE: Oh!
Oh!
l'm awfully sorry.
l didn't mean to frighten you.
Oh, it...wasn't that.
lt's just that
you're a...a...
A stranger?
We--we have?
Well, of course.
You said so yourself.
''Once upon a dream.''
Who are you?
What's your name?
Hmm?
Oh. My name.
Why, it's...
it's...
Oh, no, no! l can't! l--
Good-bye!
But when will l see you again?
Oh, never! Never!
Well...maybe someday.
When? Tomorrow?
At the cottage, in the glen.
There.
Whoop!
Well, what do you think of it?
Why, it--
it's a very unusual
cake, isn't it?
Yes.
Of course, it will be
much stiffer after it's baked.
Um...what do you
think of the dress?
Well, it--it's...
Oh, l improved it.
But perhaps if l added
a few more ruffles...
uh, what do you think?
Um...l think so.
What do you think,
Merryweather?
l think we've had enough
of this nonsense!
l think we ought
to think of Rose
and what she'll
think of this mess!
l still think what
l thunk before.
You know...l think
she's right.
Here they are!
Good as new!
C-c-careful, Merryweather.
Quick!
Lock the doors.
We can't take any chances.
Now, you take care
of the cake.
Clean the room, dear.
And l'll make the dress.
Ooh!
Come on,
bucket, mop, broom.
And now, to make a lovely dress
fit to grace a fair Princess.
Just do it like it
says here in the book.
l'll put on the candles.
Oh, no! Not pink!
Oh, no! Not pink!
Make it blue!
Merryweather!
Make it pink.
Make it blue.
Oh! Pink!
Blue!
Shh! Shh! Listen!
lt's Rose!
She's back!
Enough of this foolishness!
Make it pink.
Now hide! Quick!
Blue!
Aunt Flora!
Good gracious!
Stop, mop!
Aunt Flora!
Fauna! Merryweather!
Oh!
Happy Birthday!
Oh, you darlings!
This is the happiest day
of my life!
Everything's so wonderful!
Just wait till you meet him!
Him?
Rose!
You've met some stranger?
Oh, he's not a stranger.
We've met before.
You have?
Where?
Once upon a dream.
FAUNA: She's in love!
-Oh, no!
-This is terrible!
Why?
After all, l am sixteen.
lt isn't that, dear.
You're already betrothed.
Betrothed?
Since the day you were born.
To Prince Phillip, dear.
But that's impossible.
How could l marry a Prince?
A Princess.
And you are, dear.
Princess Aurora.
But...but l can't!
He's coming here tonight.
But you must never see
that young man again.
Oh, no! No!
No! No!
And we thought
she'd be so happy.
No sign of her yet, Hubert.
Of course not.
lt's a good half-hour
till sunset.
Ah, excellent bird.
Mmm!
Aw, now, come, man!
Buck up!
Battle's over.
l'm sorry, Hubert...
but after sixteen years
of worrying...
never knowing--
The past! All in the past!
with something l've
been saving for sixteen years.
Here!
To the future!
Skumps! Skumps!
Skumps!
And now, to the new home, eh?
New home?
Children need a nest
of their own, what?
-Skumps!
-Skumps!
Uh, let me fill up your glass.
Ha! Ha! That last
was all foam.
The plans!
Nothing elaborate, of course.
Forty bedrooms, dining hall.
Honeymoon cottage, really.
You--you mean...
you're building it already?
Built, man! Finished!
Lovebirds can move in tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
But, Hubert, they're
not even married yet!
l'll take care of that tonight.
To the wedding!
Now, hold on, Hubert.
Of course, but--
Well, there's no time to lose.
Getting on in years.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
To the wedding!
-Well?
-Well, it--it...
may come as quite a shock.
Shock?!
My Phillip a shock?!
What's wrong with my Phillip?
Nothing, Hubert.
l only meant--
Why doesn't your daughter
like my son?
Now, now--
l'm not so sure my son
likes your daughter!
Now, see here--
l'm not so sure
my grandchildren...
want you for a grandfather!
Why, you--you unreasonable...
pompous, blustering,
old windbag!
Unreasonable? Pompous?
En garde, sir!
l warn you, Hubert!
This means war!
Forward!
For honor! For country! For--
What's this all about, anyway?
Nothing, Hubert.
Absolutely nothing.
The children are bound
to fall in love with each other.
Precisely.
And as for grandchildren...
l'll have
the royal woodcarvers...
start work
on the cradle tomorrow!
Splendid!
King size, of course?
Certainly.
To the Woodcarver's Guild!
Phillip!
Oh, Phillip!
Phillip!
Phillip! Hold, Phillip!
H-hurry, boy!
Hurry! Change into
something suitable!
Can't meet your future bride
looking like that.
But l have met her, Father.
You have? Where?
Once upon a dream.
HUBERT: Phillip!
Stop! Stop that!
Phillip! P-put me down!
Now...what's all
this dream nonsense?
lt wasn't a dream, Father.
l really did meet her.
The Princess Aurora?
Good heavens!
We must tell Stefan!
Why, this is the most--
l didn't say it was Aurora.
You most certainly did!
You--you said that--
l said l met the girl
l was going to marry.
l don't know who she was.
A peasant girl,
l suppose--
A peasant g-girl?
You're--you're going
to marry a...
Why, Phillip!
You're joking!
Uh...isn't he?
No! Y-you can't
do this to me!
Give up the throne?
The kingdom?
For some...some nobody?
By Harry, l won't have it!
You're a Prince!
And you're going
to marry a Princess!
Now, Father, you're
living in the past.
This is the 1 th century.
Nowadays--
Nowadays,
l'm still the King!
And l command you to come
to your senses!
And marry the girl l love.
-Exactly!
-Good-bye, Father.
''Good-bye, Father.
Marry the girl you--''
No, no!
No, no, Phillip, stop!
Come back!
Phillip!
Oh!
Oh, how--how will
l ever tell Stefan?
Come along, now.
All right, in here, dear.
And now, dear,
if you'll just sit here.
This one last gift...
dear child for thee...
the symbol of thy royalty.
A crown to wear
in grace and beauty,
as is thy right and royal duty.
Now, dear.
Come.
Let her have
a few moments alone.
lt's that boy she met.
Whatever are we going to do?
Oh, l don't see why she has
to marry any old Prince.
Now, that's not
for us to decide, dear.
Maybe we should tell King Stefan
about the boy.
Well, why don't we?
Listen!
Maleficent! Rose!
ALL: Rose! Rose! Aah!
ALL: Rose! Rose!
Here.
ALL: Rose! Rose!
Rose, where are you?
Where are you?
ALL: Rose!
ALL: Rose!
Rose!
ALL: Rose!
Rose, don't touch anything!
You poor, simple fools.
Thinking you could defeat me.
Well, here's your
precious Princess.
Rose!
Oh, Rose!
Oh, l'll never forgive myself.
Stefan, there's--
there's something important
l have to tell you.
Not now, Hubert.
But it's about Phillip.
Phillip?
Oh, yes, of course, Phillip.
Why, where is the boy?
That's what l'm trying
to tell you.
Well, send for him immediately!
-But--
-Shh!
Poor King Stefan and the Queen.
They'll be heartbroken
when they find out.
They're not going to.
We'll put them all to sleep...
until Rose awakens.
Come!
Well, just been
talking to Phillip.
Seems he's fallen in love
with some...
Peasant girl.
Peasant girl?
Yes? Yes?
The peasant girl--
who is she?
Where did he meet her?
Just some peasant girl he met.
Where?! Where?!
Once upon a dream.
Once upon a dr--
Rose! Prince Phillip!
Oh! Oh!
FLORA: Come on.
We've got to get back
to the cottage.
Whistling
Well...
this is a pleasant surprise.
l set my trap
for a peasant, and lo,
l catch a Prince!
Away with him.
But gently, my pets...
gently.
l have plans
for our royal guest.
ALL: Maleficent!
She's got Prince Phillip!
At the forbidden mountain.
But we can't!
We can't go there!
We can, and we must!
What a pity Prince Phillip...
can't be here to enjoy
the celebration.
Come.
We must go to the dungeon
and cheer him up.
Oh, come now, Prince Phillip.
Why so melancholy?
A wondrous future lies
before you.
You, the destined hero...
of a charming fairy tale
come true.
Behold...
The years roll by...
but a hundred years
to a steadfast heart...
are but a day.
to wake his love...
with love's first kiss...
Why, you--you...
Come, my pet.
Let us leave our noble Prince...
with these happy thoughts.
A most gratifying day.
For the first time
in sixteen years...
l shall sleep well.
Shh! No time to explain.
Wait, Prince Phillip.
The road to true love
may be barred...
by still many more dangers...
So arm thyself...
with this enchanted shield
of virtue...
Now, come. We must hurry.
FLORA: Phillip, watch out!
Silence!
You, tell those fools to...
No! No!
FAUNA: Watch out, Phillip!
Hurry! Hurry, Phillip!
A forest of thorns
shall be his tomb.
A forest of thorns
shall be his tomb.
Born through the skies
on a fog of doom.
No, it cannot be!
Now shall you deal
with me, o Prince...
and all the powers of hell!
Up! Up this way!
FLORA: Now, Sword of Truth,
fly swift and sure...
that evil die and good endure!
Oh, oh, uh, forgive me, Hubert.
The wine.
Now, uh, you were saying?
Huh? l was?
Oh, oh, yes.
Well, after all, Stefan...
this is the 1 th century.
Yes. You, uh--
you said that a moment ago.
Well, to come right
to the point...
my son Phillip says
he's going to marry--
lt's Aurora. She's here!
And--and--and Phillip!
What does this mean, boy?
l--l don't...
But, but, but...
l don't understand.
Why, Fauna,
what's the matter, dear?
Oh, l just love happy endings.
Yes. l do, too.
Blue?!
Pink!
Blue!
