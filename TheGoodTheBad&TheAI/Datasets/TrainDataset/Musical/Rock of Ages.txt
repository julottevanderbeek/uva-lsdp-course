Oh, my Gad.
Lack, I'm sorry this happened. It sucks.
I'm Drew.
Sherrie.
"The Bourbon Roam"?

- Yeah. I'm a barback.
One of these days,
my name's gonna be up there.
- You're in a band?
- I'm a singer.
Get cut! Me tan.
Oh, my God. The Bourbon Room. I have,
like, 10 albums that were recorded there.
More like "had"?
Had.
Yep.
Well, thank you.
Thanks.
Again.
WOMAN 1:
Don't go in there, it's filth!
- Hey.
WOMAN 2: Don't join them!
Dc you need ajab?
I could talk to Dennis Dupree, my bass.
WOMAN 3:
Pray you'll be saved!
Are you serious?
Just whatever you do,
don't tell him you're a singer.
DENNIS:
Jimmy!
I told you 10,000 times.
Girls drink free, dudes pay full freight.
They are dudes.
Lack, I haven't charged a girl since '13.
For a minute, I thought that
Kate Jackson from Charlie's Angels...
-...had walked into my club.
- More like Michael Jackson.
- Doesn't he lack pale to you?
- He does a bit.
Dennis! Meet Sherrie.
She needs a job, man.
Na, I don't think so. She's a singer.
No, she just came in
from out of town.
DENNIS:
Oh, okay, now, if I may.
- You sang in the church chair every Sunday.
- Lutheran.
Senior year, you had the third lead
in your high school musical.
- Sound of Music.
DENNIS: And then somebody...
...your adorable Aunt Betty,
told you you had real talent.
- It was actually my Aunt Doris.
DENNIS: Uh-huh.
And like a flaming dipshit you believed her,
dumped yourjock boyfriend...
...ditched town and moved to Hollywood
to have a crack at fame and fortune.
Am I missing anything?
L...
Yeah, okay.
SHERRIE: Actually, my boyfriend
wasn't really athletic.
And look. I'm a waitress.
Came an. She's practically
gut mike burns an her lips.
I'm not interested, sweetheart.
I need you two to get back to work.
- Please, Mr. Dupree. I'm a hard worker.
- You seem like a really nice kid.
I just gm mugged-
I have $17 to my name and I'm probably
gonna be starving in the next 48 hours.
- And Beth just quit.
- Beth just quit?
Okay, fine. You're hired.
Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
What are you thanking me for? I ruined
your life. You start training tomorrow.
This place is turning into a war zone.
It's Arsenal's last show.
Arsenal? Oh, my Gad, I lave Stacee Jaxx.
It's your lucky day. He's going sale.
Hey, want to go celebrate?
I'm coming up an my break.
Yeah. Sure.
A year Hga...
A year ago,
people asked whose campaign...
...I would throw
my financial support behind...
...and I knew there was only one man
an the ticket...
...that could restore the city
to its original glory.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mayor Mike Whitmore.
MIKE: Thank you. Couldn't have done it
without you, Doug.
Ahh.
Thank you, Les Angeles.
You know, Doug Flintlock here...
well, he just leaned into my ear
and he said:
"Mike, I have kids. Teenagers.
And these days, I'm scared for them.
We need to clean up this city."
Well, I can tell you that...
...l, for one, am not scared
for our city's children.
And that's because
I have a secret weapon.
My rack.
My soul mate.
And the best darn wife
any man could hope to have.
Please welcome my wife:
The beautiful Patricia Whitmore!
Oh.
Came an up here, Patty-cake!
We did it!
Oh. Thank you.
Today, the city of Los Angeles
gets a twofer!
Nat only the best mayor this city
has ever had...
...but also me.
A mother.
So tomorrow, as part of my
"Clean Up The Strip" initiative...
...we start to make this city safe
again for our young people.
She lacks familiar to me, this woman.
She lacks eerily familiar.
You've probably popped something an
your ass that resembles her.
I shouldn't have thought so. That's all
cleared up nicely, thank you very much.
Rock 'n' roll is a disease.
But it is a disease with a cure.
DENNIS:
You don't know her.
Man, back then, her husband,
Mayor Whitmore...
...used to be one of my best customers.
Wow. New lack at him.
Married to a woman
who lacks like she's been hibernating...
...in Margaret Thatcher's bumhale.
- Ofi our streets
and knock the sucker back...
What happens to people?
Don't know, Den.
Suppose they get corrupted
and seduced by the Man...
...get old and bitter and run for mayor.
Or they run a club,
live the rack 'n' roll dream...
...and get old and bitter that way.
Here's to rack 'n' roll.
Ta rack 'n' roll.
And let's reclaim the Strip for the
God-fearing citizens of Los Angelesi
I cannot believe
that I'm working at The Bourbon.
Thank you so much.
Don't even mention it.
Oh, my Gad.
Arsenal Live at The Bourbon.
- Hands dawn, favorite record ever.
- Me tan.
I would've killed to be at that concert.
That record really changed my life.
I decided if I couldn't see Stacee Jaxx...
...I was gonna be Stacee Jaxx.
Bought  beat-up six string
In a secondhand store
Didn't know how to play it
But I knew for sure
That one guitar
Felt good in my hands
To understand
Just one guitar
Slung way down low
Was a one-way ticket
Only one way to go
- So I started rockin
- Rock:'n'
Ain't never gonna stop
No
- Gotta keep on rockin
- Rock:'n'
Someday I'm gonna make it to the top
And sing
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time
And dance with me
In a town with no name
In a heavy downpour
Thought I passed my own shadow
By the backstage door
Like a trip through the past
To that day in the rain
And that one guitar
Made my whole life change
be mow'n' on and s:'ng:'n'
That same old song
Yeah, with me
S:'ng:'n'
And be a jukebox hero
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I'm a jukebox hero
So come and take your time
And dance with me
- Just-a one guitar
CHORUS: Jukebox hero
DREW & SHERRIE:
Got  eyes
- I'm just a jukebox hero
- Ah, ah, ah
- Jukebox hero
CHORUS: Stars, stars
I love rock 'n' roll
- Jukebox hero
CHORUS: Stars, stars
So come and take your time
And dance with me
DREW & SHERRIE
in our eyes
I love rock 'n' roll
Whoa.
SHERRIE
Whew.
The problem is, I think I'll only ever
be good an ajukebax.
What do you mean?
I get stage fright.
You've gotta be kidding me.
Na.
You've gotta breathe.
I think I gut that part dawn.
Na, I'm serious, you've gotta breathe.
Like, takes away the nerves.
Breathe in through your nose
and out through your mouth.
Dc it a couple times. You'll be fine.
Maybe you should help me practice.
Are you asking me out an a date?
Yeah.
Then yes.
Coal.
Okay, well, I should probably check
into my motel and grab my stuff, 50...
Gotta get back to work.
- Okay, well, bye. Oh.
- Bye.
Bye. Oh. Ha-ha.
Surf!!-
SECRETARY:
Well, good night.
See you tomorrow, Mrs. Whitmore.
Mr. Whitmore. Call me.
PATRICIA:
Mm.
- Mike?
- Mm.
- Why so jumpy?
- Oh.
Well, it's just that Doug Flintlock.
He wants the Strip, Patty-cake,
and we have to deliver.
Of course we will, sweetheart.
H aw?
- We'll go after the head of the snake.
- Och.
- The Bourbon.
- Oh, right.
If we cut off the head, the Strip will die.
The Bourbon could be a Benetton
by the end of the month.
New listen: Me and the ladies
are going after all the church groups...
...ta make this happen.
We're even talking
to the Health Department.
We should review all their paperwork
for violations.
Oh, trust me...
...if we find so much as a hair
in a cocktail alive...
...we're shutting them dawn.
Hey, bass, we found some hairs
in the cocktail olives again.
Then rinse them off.
Okay.
Na!
Nobody puts Donkey in the corner!
- That game's tan bloody surreal anyway.
- Ugh!
Dennis, did you just sigh audibly? Why?
Taxes. They're so un-rack 'n' roll.
Cheer up, mate. You still gut
the twisted sisters of piety outside...
...all flustered and worked up,
so we must be doing something right, eh?
Well, at least we have
the Arsenal show coming up.
But that means our whale existence
is riding an Stacee Jaxx.
Stacee Jaxx, the mast unreliable man
in the music industry?
A man who blew off the halftime show
at the Super Bowl...
...ta attend a satanic ritual
to sew up Debbie Harry's vagina?
Please stop.
- The Satanists wouldn't even do that.
- You're not helping.
Why would the devil close vaginae'?
No one's qualified to do that.
Hand me the phone.
Let's do a telethon, because this might
work better than your Stacee Jaxx idea.
Shut it!
I'm calling Stacee's manager, Paul Gill.
- Ahem. Speak.
DENNIS: Hello, Paul? It's Dennis Dupree.
Dennis. What's up, brother man?
Oh, I was just calling to check in
and see if we're still an for Friday.
Of course we are. Arsenal's last show.
We're kicking off Stacee's
solo press tour there.
Rolling Stone just confirmed.
They would like to interview him
an the premises, okay?
- What did he say?
- He told me to turn off the radio.
- Sn turn it off.
- The radio in his head!
- Calm dawn!
- Oh, Gad.
Paul?
Paul?
Paul?
- Paul?
- Oh, crap. Yeah, sorry, man.
Yeah. ls Stacee okay?
PAU L:
Stacee ?
He's fantastic. I'm lacking at him
right now. He's waving hello.
Yes, I'm talking to Dennis.
Oh-ha. He just flipped me off.
Same old Stacee. Right?
Okay, I gotta dash.
I'll talk to you Friday, babe, okay?
Put something an, man.
Banzai.
Jesus.
Stacee?
I didn't know you had a twin.
I don't.
Stacee.
You need to go an stage, man.
I am an stage, Paul.
Shit.
PATRICIA:
Take a good lack, ladies.
Take a hard...
...gaad, lung...
...hard...
look.
This man, this man is responsible
for so much filth.
WOMAN: He's Satan.
MIKE: She is an extraordinary woman.
Such a beacon of courage.
He's like a machine
that spews out three things:
- Sex...
WOMEN: Oh!
-...hateful music...
ALL: Oh.
...and...
...sex.
Can you came take some dictation
for me in the parish office, Ms. Hoyt?
Of course, sir.
My sun ate the head of my neighbor's
horse because of Stacee Jaxx.
Ugh. Well, his filthy little hateful music...
...sex ride is aver.
- Gotta stop!
WOMAN: Yes.
And we're the ones who are gonna do it.
Well, you're a real tough cookie
With a long history
Of breaking little hearts
Like the one in me
That's okay
Let's see how you do it
Put up your dukes
Let's get down to it
Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me
With your best shot?
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away
You come on with a come-on
You don't fight fair
That's okay
See if I care
Knock me down
It's all in vain
I'll get right back on my feet again
Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me
With your best shot?
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away
WOMEN:
Paw! Paw!
POW!
Well, you're a real tough cookie
With a long history
Of breaking little hearts
Like the one in me
Before I put another notch
In my lipstick case
You better make sure
You put me in my place
Hit me with your best shot
Come on!
Hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away
Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me
With your best shot?
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away
Han!
- Ai! Jesus.
- Na, Chico. Jesus is my brother.
Oye, Dennis told me to tell you
to come in early tomorrow.
Yeah, sure. Whatever, man.
I need to go get ready. I have a big date
tonight with Sherrie. Wish me luck.
Yeah, whatever that means. Okay, bye.
So long
I've been looking too hard
I've been waiting too long
Sometimes I don't know
What I will find
I only know it's a matter of time
When you love someone
When you love someone
It feels so right
So warm and true
I need to know if you feel it too
Maybe I'm wrong
Won't you tell me
If I'm coming on too strong?
This heart of mine has been hurt before
This time I wanna be sure
Hey, girl.
To come into my life
A love that will survive
I've been wa:'t:'n' for someone new
To make me feel alive
To come into my life
- Won't you come into my life?
- Won't you come into my life?
SHERRIE: Wow. It's like a giant velvet blanket
covered in diamonds.
DREW:
Yeah, it's beautiful, isn't it?
SHERRIE: Yeah, it's a little different
than Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Sn, what did your mam think
about the big move to L.A.?
She thought it was stupid.
My dad just totally didn't get it.
His advice:
"You're gonna fail anyway,
so why not fail closer to home?"
Okay. Total optimist.
What about your folks?
What did they think of the big move?
Um...
Not a whole lot really.
I was raised by my grandma.
Yeah, she, by the way,
was all for me getting out of Oklahoma.
- Really?
- Mm.
Yeah, she said to me:
"Haney, there ain't nothing for you here...
...and the last thing that I want you to do
is wind up stuck here like me."
Man, I adore her.
You're a nice guy, aren't you?
I try to be.
Why?
She wanted to know.
Oh, my Gad,
I can't believe I'm actually here.
I'm so hﬂPPY-
There's nowhere on earth
That I'd rather be
Than holding you tenderly
- I've been wa:'t:'n' for  girl like you
- I've been wa:'t:'n' for  boy like you
- To come into my life
- To come into my life
- I've been wa:'t:'n' for  girl like you
- I've been wa:'t:'n' for  boy like you
- A love that will survive
- A love that will survive
- I've been waitin'
- I've been waitin'
- For someone new
- For someone new
- To make me feel alive
- To make me feel alive
- Yeah, wa:'t:'n' for  girl like you
- Yeah, wa:'t:'n' for  boy like you
- To come into my
- To come into my
- Life
- Life
Wait.
- What?
- You're gonna sing me a sang.
Oh, nu. Oh, nu, nu, I can't.
DREW:

SHERRIE: You are gonna sing
whether you like it or not.
- Now, breathe!
- Hey.
Don't be nervous.
Okay, uh...
This is something I kind of started
working an after we met last night.
DREW :
Just a small-town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train gain'
Anywhere
A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
And it goes an and an and an.
Heh. I lave it.
It's so beautiful. I can't believe you
wrote that. It's amazing.
DREW:

What about Drew?
Drool are very expensive.
Nat Drool. Drew.
What?
Drew? That Drew? Our Drew?
- He's better than Concrete Ballz.
LONNY: Goad paint.
- Concrete Ballz are very heavy.
- And he'll do it for free.
DENNIS:
Baby, baby, baby.
Came an, nobody cares
about the opening act anyway.
- Na offense.

SHERRIE:

The spotlight doesn't just light them up.
It makes us disappear.
You'll see.
Say:'n' "I love you
Is not the words
I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew
How easy
It would be to show me how you feel
More than words
Is all you'd have to do
To make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say
That you love me
'Cause I'd already know
SHERRIE: Hey, I'm gonna take my break.
- Okay.
How I love the way you move
And the sparkle in your eyes
There's a color deep inside them
Like a blue suburban sky
I don't need to be the king of the world
As long as I'm the hero
- Of this little girl
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
- Heaven isn't too far away
- Heaven isn't too far away
- Closer to it every day
- Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends say
- I know we're gonna find a way
- More than words
- Is all you have to do to make it real
- You have to do to make it real
- Then you wouldn't have to say
- Then you wouldn't have to say
- Heaven isn't too far away
- Heaven isn't too far away
Heaven isn't too far away
More than words
Yeah, heaven isn't too far away
More than words
'Cause I'd already
Know

- Yes.
Right an, brother. Rack 'n' roll.
Na. When I'm dune, we literally need
to burn this place to the ground.
Otherwise the fire phoenix gets trapped.
Yes, I suppose so.
Ha-ha. It's a joke. I'm kidding, man.
I mean, of course, you're not really gonna
burn the place down to the ground, right?
Na.
You can't trap a fire phoenix.
I mean, that'd be crazy, right?
It would be. Yeah.
I mean, seriously...

Na, nu, nu. Na.
New go.
Uh-- At The Bourbon, where it all started.
Your first album Stick Meat gave birth
to some of rock's greatest anthems.
And new a solo career. Why now?
Well, ahem...
...I think...
I think due to the changing nature
of the music industry...
...the change in cultural trends...
...and when you think of
blah-blah-blah and blah-blah-blah.
--You make sure that you wanna take in
blah-blah-blah. Ha-ha.
- Okay.
- Four minutes.
You know, some people have said that
you've became quite difficult to work with.
That you're constantly late, you're
reclusive, sometimes even nonsensical.
I wanna ask you this:
Have these people even met themselves?
Well, I'm talking about your band.
Let me tell you something.
I know me better than anyone...
...because I live in here.
- Eight minutes.
- You just said four.
- Three.
- But it--
Dc you think that it's possible...
...that you've shut out or alienated
so many people...
...that you had no other option
but to go solo?
You gotta be true to the muse. Hey Man.
Scotch me, little buddy.
And who is your muse? Ahem.
Right.
Fine.

in 11th grade.
Your first concert was Aerasmith.
When you were 11, you hitchhiked to L.A.
with your high school sweetheart.
Time.
You know, you're not so weird.
You're just another lonely man
with many regrets.
I said time. You can go now.
Final question.
What happens when you realize
you can't get rid of Stacee Jaxx?
You have no idea what it's like to be me.
Well, then here's your chance.
What's it like to be the Stacee Jaxx?
KS all the same
Only the names will change
Another place
Where the faces are so cold
I drive all night just to get back home
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wan ted
Dead or alive
Wan ted
Dead or alive
Sometimes I sleep
Sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet
Always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day
By the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone
All you do is think
Dalai Lama.
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wan ted
BOTH :
Wanted
STAC E E:
Dead or alive
Wan ted
ALL:
Wanted
Dead or alive
CROWD :
Stacee! Stacee! Stacee! Stacee! Stacee!
Oh, and I ride
A loaded six string on my back
I play for keeps
'Cause I might not make it back
I've been everywhere
Still standing tall
I've seen a million faces
And I've rocked them all
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wan ted
Wan ted
Dead or alive
Well, I'm a cowboy
I got the night on my side
I'm wan ted
Wan ted
Dead or alive
And I ride
And I ride
Dead or alive
I still drive
I still drive
- Dead or alive
- Dead or alive
I'm Stacee.
Sherrie.
Sherrie.
When my hamster died...
your music really helped me through.
You have such a perky...
...heart.
Thank you.
Dc me a favor.
Sure.
There's a cut-glass battle of Scotch
in the limo.
Bring it to my dressing roam?
Right away.
Now, Patricia, this is the third night
in a raw that you've been here.
- Why so passionate?
- Well, Mitch, this has to end.
We're calling on anyone with children
to join forces with us...
...and show up here every night...
...until the doors of these places
are closed for good.
Stacee Jaxx can wreck his awn life.
But when it comes to raping...
...the ears of our children
with this poison...
-...we have to fight!
- Well, they-
Rack 'n' roll is the only freedom
we have.
Stacee Jaxx is Gad!
Rock 'n ' roll forever! Waah!
Sniff the mike. Whoa!
I'm walking here! Whoa!
PAUL: Okay, great interview.
I hope you gut everything.
- You're not a cowboy.
- Why don't you tell me what I am?
- You're a man-child stuck in a rut.
- I lave it when you talk dirty.
You used to be great. But whatever
made you that way, it's gone.
That's right. Give it to me rough.
You're another rocker
asleep at the wheel...
-...singing songs you wrote 10 years ago.
- Okay, lady.
As long as you've gut this manager
keeping you an the road...
...and doping you up with girls and booze
and million-dollar record deals...
...he's gonna keep you asleep
and drive your career off a cliff.
- Line crossed. Let's go, sweetheart.
- Don't touch me.
You used to write great songs.
Where are they now?
PAUL: You know what? I'm calling your editor.
Close friend of mine, by the way.
WOMAN : Rolling Stone magazine.
- Jann Wenner's office.
Get cut.
My wards exactly.
This interview is aver.
Na, nu, nu. Nat her.
You.
All of you.
Copy that. Everybody cut.
You know, I think you get
this sense of entitlement...
...due to the fact that you're a rack god.
But it's not real.
It's not lave.
Na.
It's not lave.
Then what is it?
Off the record?
Sex.
And other people's projections
of what they want me to be.
Of what you and all your readers
want me to be.
Sex.
And it keeps me from going cut...
...and getting the one thing
that could save me.
But I can't have that now.
I'm a slave to rack 'n' roll.
I am searching for the perfect sang...
...the perfect sound that will
make you wanna live forever.
Like I said:
I know me better than anyone
because I live in here.
And no one else can.
I can.
I can.
little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
Ooh, ahh, ahh
In my life
There's been heartache and pain
