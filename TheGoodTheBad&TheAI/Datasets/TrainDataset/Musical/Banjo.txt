Man, you guys play so well.
Everyone in 0111 area said...
"No one will bother to come down...'
"...if you guys don't play at Navlatri".
That song you guys
played on Gaupati festival.
Absolutely wonderful.
People are just dying
to shower money on you.
And now you demand double the fee.
I meaumyou guys charge double
if the client comes himself.
This isn't right.
Life gives you two choices.
'Either take whatever you get...'
'...ol...snatch what you like.'
Now, you decide.
I Want double.
It's flue.
See you.
How are you?
Please talk to him.
He's asking fol double the fees.
Why double?
We're just getting in demand.
That's exactly Why
We can demand double.
Say What?
You won't understand just yet.
I will when you're
old enough to understand.
Unbelievable, Tataat. Amazing.
What did you understand?
- I didn't...
But if Tania! is saying it,
it must he right.
Right...
I've been trying to explain you for
thlee days, do I look crazy to you'?
Can't you listen. . .01
you don't want to listen?
You go...you must be getting late.
Don't forget to call
after you reach, please.
Don't Worry, mom.
It's only fol a few days...
...and everything's been taken care of.
But he careful,
Mulnbai is a really nice place,
and so are its people.
But not everyone's too nice.
Gotya.
- Yeah.
How did I play?
Simply amazing.
But if you could play
a little better, then...
Then What?
You think Tania! plays hetlel than me.
That's not What I meant, but...
He took the Gaupati gig as Well.
It's just his good luck.
But soon 0111 time will change.
The biggest 'Navratri'
gig is 0111s after all.
Where will they go'?
Pakya...
- Yeah.
We lost the 'Navlatri' gig as Well.
They hooked Tania! and
his hand fol double the late.
What?
Boss...Double!
Tataat! Tataat! Tataat!
Bloody Iascals been
s**** me all the time.
I feel like strangling
the life out of him.
This time...I'm going to play
like no one's seen ol heard hefole.
Just let the festivals begin.
Mom, I've leached Mumhai.
It's so colorful.
Hey...
How many times have I told you...
".110! to pickup money with your mouth.
Shame, don't come.'
This is exactly why
people think we're beggars.
Does anyone tell the dllllllll. player
to pickup n1oney from the mouth'?
Does anyone tell a
Harmonium playel to do it?
This is Why I am ashamed to
tell anyone that I play the Banjo.
Sit. . .you_t order'?
Wasn't one enough?
Give it to him.
- Thank you.
Remember why you asked double charge?
So listen...
Half fol playing the banjo...
...and the other half
for the humiliation.
We're not going to get
any respect in this lifetime.
So Why don't We charge
double and make some extra money.
What say...
You're right, Talaat.
I didn't understand,
but since Talaafs saying"
...it must he right...
Hey wise-guy... trying to show-off
because you are paid double.
Life gives you two choices.
EiLhel you punch him in the them...
...ol you earn double of what
he does and punch him in the guts.
Come on.
"Round. . .Iou_nd. . . The world's round. "
