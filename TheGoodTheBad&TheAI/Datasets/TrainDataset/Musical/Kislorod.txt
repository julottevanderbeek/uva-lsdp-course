Track 1
Dancing
Have you heard the Bible:
'Thou shalt not kill.
'He who kills shall be judged'?
I knew a guy with bad hearing.
He didn't hear
'thou shalt not kill. '
Maybe because
he had headphones on.
He didn't hear
'thou shalt not kill. '
He took a spade,
went into his yard
and killed someone.
He came back, turned up the music
and danced.
The music was so funny
his dancing turned funny.
His shoulders went funny
and his feet,
and his hair, and his eyes.
The dancing lured him
into a new land.
That land had nothing but movement,
only dancing and more dancing.
He decided to stay there for good.
He decided not to spend
another minute
without dancing.
Every person has two inner dancers:
One left and one right.
Two lunging dancers. Two lungs.
The right lung and the left.
Every person has two dancers -
his right and left lung.
The lungs dance
and the person gets oxygen.
If you take a spade
and hit the chest area,
the lungs stop dancing;
the oxygen stops.
This guy knew all about dancing
but he had bad hearing.
He was dancing
when his friends came by.
He did not hear them screaming,
'Sanyok, you butchered your wife.
Have you lost it, shithead? '
But Sanyok didn't hear his friend
through the headphones.
Then his friend punched him
in the face,
in the stomach and the chest.
The chest dancers stopped
and Sanyok fell down,
gasping for oxygen.
Every person has two dancers:
One left and one right.
Two lunging dancers.
The right lung and the left.
Every person has two dancers -
his right and left lung.
The lungs dance
and the person gets oxygen.
If you take a spade
and hit the chest area,
the lungs stop dancing;
the oxygen stops.
Sanyok gasped for oxygen
until he felt his chest dancers
move again.
He asked his friends,
'What do you want? '
Then his friend who punched him
asked again about the butchered wife
in the yard.
And when Sanyok understood,
he said he whacked her with a spade
because he fell in love
with another woman.
His wife had black hair.
The other was a redhead.
The girl with black hair
and fat fingers had no oxygen.
The girl with red hair, thin fingers
and the man's name Sasha, did.
When Sanyok realized
his wife was not oxygen,
and the girl named Sasha was,
and when he realized
no one can live without it,
he took the spade
and cut off the dancers legs
in his wife's chest.
Every person has two dancers:
One left and one right.
Two lunging dancers.
The right lung and the left.
Every person has two dancers -
his right and left lung.
The lungs dance
and the person gets oxygen.
If you take a spade
and hit the chest area,
the lungs stop dancing;
the oxygen stops.
Every woman contains two dancers
and every woman consumes oxygen,
but not every woman
is oxygen herself.
When mankind was told
'thou shalt not kill,'
there wasn't enough oxygen
for everyone.
Some small-town Sanyok will always
want to dance, and will take a spade
and kill his non-oxygen wife
so his lungs can breathe freely.
Because when it was said
'thou shalt not kill,'
he had his headphones on
and dancers lured him into the land
of dancing and oxygen.
Whosoever sayeth unto his brother
'Raca-you're dead meat,'
he shall be judged.
But whosoever sayeth 'You fool,'
shall be in danger of hell fire.
Track 2
Sasha loves Sasha
Have you heard this?:
'Thou shalt not commit adultery';
and 'Whosoever lusteth after a wife
hath committed adultery
in his heart. '
Imagine how big
a man's heart must be
to embrace all the wives
he has lusted after.
That's no heart,
but a double bed
with sheets soaked in semen.
My small-town friend Sasha committed
adultery in his heart
with the city girl Sasha,
whom he first saw by a statue
on the square
as she smoked dope with her friends.
It is said, 'Thou shalt not look
at a woman with lust. '
This means: Do not commit adultery
in your heart.
Those gazing at women with lust
have their hearts locked
with a padlock.
He who lusts strives
not to fulfill a woman
but to empty himself.
When my small-town friend, Sanyok,
with the oxygen dancers
in his chest,
saw redheaded Sasha,
he wanted her so badly
his heart turned into a double bed
with white linen.
When he saw Sasha barefoot,
he experienced an oxygen overdose,
for an oxygen overdose
happens to those
suffering from oxygen famine.
It is said, 'Thou shalt not look
at a woman with lust. '
This means do not commit adultery
in your heart.
Those looking at women with lust
have their hearts locked
with a padlock.
He who lusts strives
not to fulfill a woman
but to empty himself.
Oxygen famine strikes those
who breathe oxygen-poor air
for years,
who breathe women smelling of sweat
and cheap perfume.
If you don't have money
for perfume,
you can always afford soap
and organic shampoo.
If you don't have a fancy outfit,
you can make a sundress yourself.
If you follow fashion magazines
and don't realize that fashion
reflects your inner world,
then perfume and soap and sundresses
will not fill the air with oxygen.
Every man standing next to you
will experience oxygen famine.
Sasha was entirely made of oxygen.
She wore a linen dress,
carried a bag
wore string-sandals
and had big green eyes.
She had expensive
sunglasses and red hair.
When you see a girl like that,
you know this is 'oxygen. '
When you stand beside her,
you smell expensive perfume,
soap and organic shampoo.
It is said, 'Thou shalt not look
at a woman with lust. '
This means do not commit adultery
in your heart.
Those looking at women with lust
have their hearts locked
with a padlock.
He who lusts strives
not to fulfill a woman
but to empty himself.
'Lf thy right eye offend thee,
pluck it out, and cast it from thee.
Better that one
of thy members perish,
than all thy body be cast to hell.
If thy right hand offend thee,
cut it off and cast it from thee. '
For this reason,
when small-town Sanyok
looked at his wife
not with love but with lust,
he hit her on the chest
with a spade
and stopped the dancing
in her lungs.
He cut out her eye
and cut off her hand,
for better that her
'members should perish'
than subject her
Body to fiery hell.
Track 3
Yeah and Nay
Have you heard:
'Swear not by heaven,
for it is God's seat;
nor by earth,
for it is his footstool;
neither by Jerusalem,
for it is the city of the King. '
I do not know
the King ofJerusalem today.
Maybe there is no such person,
no one to bring order.
But I know I shall not swear
upon the city
where people explode
like watermelons in buses
and on squares
under the blazing sun.
But yea, this girl
with the man's name of Sasha,
she swore by heaven twice
and once by earth.
First she swore
when a stranger kissed her
right in the middle of the street -
not on the cheek,
nor the lips, nor the forehead,
nor the ear, nor the neck,
nor the shoulders, the chest,
the back, the hips,
the ass, a leg -
none of these places I named,
but he kissed her right
on the street in the middle of day.
She swore by heaven
not even a good joint
could hit her as hard
as this scandalous kiss.
The second time she swore by heaven
when her strikingly handsome
husband asked:
'Are you cheating on me
with a small-town shithead? '
And she said: 'I swear to God, no. '
She swore by earth
when she vomited
for the first time in her life
from the vodka and dumplings
she ate with friends of the guy
with whom she cheated on
her husband.
Never had she eaten
anything like that.
Right then she swore by the earth
upon which she vomited,
never again to eat such
deadly Russian food,
lacking all oxygen,
filled with the nausea and pompous
pride of great empires.
Better to smoke a joint,
eat apples and drink juice
than fall over drunk
next to a TV set,
swearing by heaven,
earth and Jerusalem
that you were seduced
by TV commercials,
instilling in your mind
what you must buy
in order to gain the right
to live on this earth.
And so, to have the right
to live on this earth...
one must learn to breathe air
and have money to buy that air
since once you get hooked on oxygen,
no money or drugs or even death
will replace the hunger
for beauty and freedom
you gain through it.
My big-city friend Sasha
only twice swore by heaven
and once by the earth
but she swore her love
many times.
She had a big heart
like a double bed
with a fancy fruit and flower print.
And every time she slept
with a new guy,
not counting her husband,
,
these extra-marital encounters
were not random for her.
She experienced love in every one.
Every time she was alone with a man
and listened to
his thoughts on love,
her head filled with words like his.
The city-girl Sasha
never spoke them aloud,
but expressed her feelings
through a smile,
a turn of the head
or a mischievous wink.
My friend Sasha
always acted like an actress
in a movie about love.
Only these relationships
between a man and a woman
contain oxygen.
If you swear love and allegiance
and feel nothing,
that's no oxygen film,
that's dog shit.
If you love but don't swear by it,
that's like German porno.
If you sleep with many men
but only love one,
that's like true Russian cinema
with birch trees
and rolling fields.
Better smoke a joint,
eat apples and drink juice
than fall over drunk
next to a TV set,
swearing by heaven,
earth and Jerusalem
that your heart belongs
to one person
and your body to another.
What then is left to swear by?
Not by God's seat,
nor his footstool,
and definitely not Jerusalem,
where people have gone mad
from stupidity,
but only by your own love.
'May your words be, yea, yea:
Nay, nay.
For anything more than that
cometh of evil. '
Track 4
Moscow Rum
Have you heard, 'Resist not wrong.
But whosoever strike thee
on thy cheek,
turn him the other.
And if a man sue thee and
take thy coat,
give him thy cloak also. '
With no regard to the law,
the girl I'm talking about
threw her clothes off
when a man she liked gave her
Moscow Rum and Coke,
and offered him a big,
fancy double bed.
But when one man struck her
on the cheek,
she refused to offer the left.
She went to his kitchen
where she took a knife
and returned to the bedroom
to stab him in the face.
The man caught her arm
and slapped her on the other cheek.
He smacked her so hard
that her nose bled
as if a fresh stream ran,
a red spring stream
in the middle of winter.
In the dead of winter
they took the train to Serpukhov.
Peddlers were selling papers,
batteries and pens.
They went to Serpukhov,
the hometown of Sanyok,
where people fall down drunk
in the middle of the day.
Where streets and houses
are full of youths
sticking needles in their veins.
They wanted to dance
where this guy danced
before he butchered his wife
with a spade.
None spoke of this to the police.
No one had any idea,
especially our girl Sasha,
who had inspired this deed.
His wife, the woman with black hair,
now slept in the Serpukhov earth.
Oxygen was of no use to her now.
When this girl Sasha
stepped off the train,
she immediately sized the town up.
Later she made a snowman
in the yard
and listened to music
with headphones on.
When Sanyok from Serpukhov
visited Moscow,
he saw snobs
and heard accents,
and knew
there were not enough spades
or earth to handle
this swarming mass,
suffocating without oxygen
under the ozone-aerosol void.
No fancy glasses will help you see
self-respect in a drunken girl
wearing black shoes and white socks.
Those punks squatting
near the liquor store
will never make a worthy
generation of young men.
When she walked in her
European dress
down the town streets
where movies are made
about the Revolution
because this place
is frozen in time,
even the dogs are ashamed
of their small-town coats.
Fleas on dogs
from Moscow and Serpukhov
have different ancestors.
Moscow fleas bit the dog
of Stanislavsky.
But Serpukhov fleas
bit Uncle Sergei's bitch.
Sergei ate those fleas
as a homeopathic remedy
for tuberculosis.
If you want to say
which is best,
then you must solve
the issue
of the greatest city on earth -
Jerusalem.
Then you go back to the trivial,
like which country you prefer,
Moscow or Russia.
For if a single Jew drives a tank
across the river
where John did his baptizing,
then anyone, even those
lacking superstition,
know explosions will follow
in otherJewish towns.
That is as true as
martins flying
low to the ground
before rainstorms.
That is as true
as town dwellers
believing themselves inferior
because the Moscow flea
gives him no peace,
and an unknown power makes him
tuck his sweater in his pants.
I think your Sasha
should go fuck herself.
I think your Sasha
should go fuck himself.
'May ye be the children
of your heavenly Father:
For he maketh the sun rise
on evil and good. '
'And sendeth rain
on the just and unjust.
For if ye love them which love you:
What reward shall ye have? '
None.
Absolutely none.
How do I feel about drugs?
I have a great story...
I was with a friend
in the United Emirates.
Snorting heroin, so to speak...
I snorted heroin,
ripped up my passport
and went to the Arab market.
I don't speak Arabic,
so there was no way back.
You have heard it said:
'Take heed that ye do not
your alms before men,
to be seen of them.
When thou doest thine alms,
sound not a trumpet before thee,
as hypocrites do
in the synagogues and streets
that they may have glory of men. '
When the city girl Sasha gave alms
to small-town Sanyok
from Serpukhov,
this happened not on the street
and certainly in no synagogue,
but under the sheets
in a dark room
behind closed doors.
And when, in return,
Sanyok from Serpukhov
gave his alms to Sasha from Moscow,
these were the best moments
of her life
for when she received
such alms from her husband,
the handsome brunet
from a theater school,
he did it with an expression
on his face
as if it all was transpiring
on a busy street
or in a synagogue at Passover
rather than under the colorful
sheets of a bed.
When Alexander gave alms
to Alexandra for the first time,
only then did he see in her eyes
that she visited him
just for such alms.
For the receiving of alms
from men was her favorite hobby.
Track 5
Arab World
'Love' and 'insanity'
are as different
as the religious consciousness
of an Iraqi Muslim
and an American Jew.
The sight of a fat woman in pants
stuffing her face with hotdogs
is as revolting to a Muslim
as it was for David Hoffermann
to find a woman's hair
on his windowsill on September 11,
after the owner of this hair,
a blonde fat woman
who wore pants,
was sent to Muslim hell
because she had undigested pork
in her stomach.
If we follow this logic
and compare 'insanity' with pork,
and 'love' with Jihad,
then the spade
which sliced open the head
of an ugly woman
equals the sword of Allah,
punishing wrongdoers
for consuming pork,
and is not a garden tool
for digging potatoes
or eliminating unwanted wives.
In fact,
everything in the world
stems from two things:
Insane love,
that is, a love of such power
it makes a person insane;
From two things:
Insane love
and a hunger for air.
In fact love and suffocation
are one and the same thing.
If you don't understand that
then don't utter words
like
'Islam'
and 'New York. '
For only 'insane love'
can justify 'insane hatred'
and vice versa.
There is just one step
between love and hate.
For love of God
Islamic extremists
fly planes into buildings,
take children hostage
and kill the unholy.
They do it for the love of Allah.
And only for the love of God
do Jews bomb
peaceful Arab settlements
and do Christians hang
the leaders of non-Christian states
who are infamy
to Christ Almighty.
'We only kill the ones we love' -
that should be inscribed
in ornate Arabic letters
on the Shahid belts
ofJihad warriors.
In order to say something
that grabs you...
I'll tell you the truth.
The problem is not that
the poor Arabs are locked
in a no-win situation
and that Jewish children
are not to blame for this.
And it's not because
you can be thrown
in a Russian prison
for five years for possessing
a handful of weed,
when for vodka,
which has destroyed a nation
and makes men hit their
pregnant wives in the stomach,
you spend the night in detox
and go home a hero.
The real problem is
that you do not know how
to love people.
The true lie is that
you know nothing
about some Sanyok from Serpukhov.
You couldn't care less how he lives
and who he might kill,
but you will cry your eyes out,
telling the story
of someone else's life.
You'll suffer over something
that just doesn't exist.
That is the problem.
And that is truly your problem.
Artistically-minded people
only contemplate their own problems.
I would never believe you if you say
you can't sleep at night
because a Moscow bum
is freezing to death.
That's a lie!
It's a lie that you snorted heroin
and wandered around a market
in the Arab Emirates.
It's a lie. You never were there.
You would never snort heroin,
because your friends
know how rational you are.
You're only good for staying
in your room with the lights off,
listening to Radiohead
for the thousandth time,
jerking off and imagining yourself
in white robes at an Arab market.
Track 7 Amnesia
It was said:
'Judge not, lest ye be judged. '
That was said to justify
memory loss.
In other words,
if someone loses a loved one
to a gunshot to the head,
they can only 'judge not' him
who did the shooting
if they forget the killer exists.
Forget guns, killers and loved ones.
Don't pretend you forgot -
forget for real,
induce clinical amnesia
in your brain.
Transform your brain into:
'I remember nothing. '
And that's that.
'Judge not, lest ye be judged. '
Forget those who murdered you
and those you murdered.
I remember nothing and no one.
Who murdered me?
I don't remember.
Did I kill? I don't remember.
I remember nothing and no one.
And that's that.
In some ancient tongue,
'to judge' means to 'forget'
but I don't recall
what tongue that is.
'Judge not' means 'see not. '
But I don't recall
which translation that is.
If I am asked, 'What did you try
so hard to say? '
I shall answer, 'I don't recall -
I have amnesia. '
If I am asked, 'What did you
wish to say? '
I shall answer,
'I don't know what you ask. '
'I don't know what you ask. '
If I hear,
'Who is this redhead with thin,
pale fingers?
Did you say she was 'Oxygen'?
I shall answer, 'I don't know
her or what she wants.
That girl died two years ago
after riding the smallest
Ferris Wheel in the world. '
If you want my opinion
of Sasha from Moscow,
I will quote one of the gods:
'Let the dead bury their dead. '
If I am asked,
'Who butchered his wife
in the yard? '
And what happened to him? '
I won't answer. I couldn't care less.
That guy died two years ago
for it was August,
and August is
the deadliest month.
When I asked my friend,
'Where is the greatest
Ferris Wheel on earth? '
She said 'I don't know. '
I said it must be in London
and that's as true as the fact
that I rode one myself with friends.
When I asked my friend,
'Where on earth
is the Valley of Death? '
He said 'I don't know. '
I said, it's in Kazakhstan
and that is as true as the fact
that I flew over that country
in a chopper myself.
When my friend asked,
'Where is
the smallest Ferris Wheel on earth? '
I answered, 'I don't know. '
She said it was in her hand
and showed me
a tiny pill in her palm.
Then she swallowed it.
When my friend asked,
'Where on earth
is another Valley of Death? '
I answered, 'I don't know. '
He said 'It's here
in a field of wormwood'
and he ran into the field.
But he was allergic to wormwood,
and he had asthma,
so he didn't make it
halfway through the field.
He fell,
the dancers fell still in his chest,
and he fell into
an eternal allergic sleep.
Because the pill had a high content
of psychotropic drugs,
and because my friend's health
wouldn't let her play
with such things,
she fell on the ground,
her chest dancers fell still
and she fell
into eternal psychotropic sleep,
as if she fell off the smallest
Ferris Wheel.
When everyone wants to talk
about friends
who died in a wormwood field,
they talk about their love
of small-town Sanyok.
When they want to talk
about a girl who overdosed,
they talk
about the big-city girl Sasha.
When people ask,
'Who is he to you? '
You say, 'I forget,'
so as not to judge.
When they ask,
'Why did you forget everything? '
You tell them the truth
for the first time.
Because I have -
Amnesia.
Track 8
Fourth Day
'There are six days
when you may work,
but the seventh day
is a Sabbath of rest to the LORD.'
Today my Lord
will be left with nothing.
No one will think of the Lord today
for today is Thursday,
not Saturday.
Let God wait a few more days,
today is Thursday,
tomorrow - Friday.
The day after tomorrow
will be God's day.
The day after tomorrow is God's day
but today is a regular day -
Thursday.
There's no room for God
in the middle of the week.
Today is Thursday,
there are two days left to God.
We'll have to wait a little longer.
For tomorrow is Friday
and God is only for Saturdays.
God is only for weekends,
for days off.
During the week
we don't worship him.
On Thursdays we don't turn to God.
We learned that long ago.
All week long we work without God.
On Saturday we rest
and God rests among us.
Only Saturday has meaning
and there is no meaning
outside Saturday.
Only Saturday in relation
to Thursday has meaning.
Without this, meaning
makes no sense.
Meaning loses meaning
when you say
aloud what you really mean to say.
Meaning loses meaning
if you write
what you truly want to write.
Meaning loses meaning
when you evaluate a situation.
Looking for meaning in meaning
is rude and uncultured.
- Culture lacks any meaning.
- As does art.
- Only the vulgar don't get that.
- Or criminals.
- Or both.
- Only Saturday has meaning.
There is no meaning
outside of Saturday.
Saturday in relation to Thursday.
Only Saturday has meaning
There is no meaning
outside of Saturday.
Saturday in relation to Thursday?
Track 9
The Essence ofThings
'Gather ye no treasure
upon the earth
where rust and moths corrupt,
and thieves break in and steal. '
'But gather ye treasure in heaven
where neither rust
nor moths corrupt,
and thieves neither break in
nor steal. '
The heavens are the essence,
for people
cross heavens on airplanes
from country to country.
Airplanes are essential,
for when they fall from the sky
they fulfill ancient prophecies.
People are essential
for their deeds bring
the end of the earth nearer.
The earth is essential,
for the bodies of war victims
are buried in it.
War is essential,
for without it,
men would not be fit.
Women would not make themselves
look pretty,
to make men shatter
each other's skulls with guns.
Guns are essential for
for they keep the death toll steady.
The dead, especially, are essential
for the construction
of new war memorials
and other works of art
made in their honor.
Honor is essential,
it makes men
throw themselves on knives
and women terminate sons
in their wombs.
Sons are essential.
And daughters too, of course.
Children serve
the essence of things.
That's why they enter this world.
Kindergarten
and the lessons they skip -
it's all essential.
The money they steal
from their parents,
their first cigarettes,
and breaking into someone's
house for the first time
it is all in the essence of things.
The essence of things
is scientists making discoveries
and criminals robbing a store.
Essence is in the hands
of musicians playing Mozart
and philatelists collecting stamps.
The essence of things
is in Michelangelo
and graffiti on walls.
For it you hate your parents
and slap your child on the face.
For essences
you throw cigarette butts
into flower pots
and drink up the money
for your son's new bike.
You don't have children
for that reason.
- You shoot a cat.
- You love, you hate, you kill
only for the essence of things.
You accuse,
you gossip and torture
for the same great thing.
- Why else would you do it?
- You shoot heroin
and buy tickets to concerts of Bach
and help a blind man
cross the street.
All for that
main essential thing.
You give alms to the poor,
you follow politics
and you slit your wrists for it.
You speak on behalf
of the essence of things
- and you can't stop talking.
- For the essence of things
you stop
and ask the essential question.
Stop.
What is most important for you?
You go first.
It sounds crass, you go first.
Same for me. You start, I'll finish.
In school you probably played doctor
with a girl.
Yes, and you?
'Advertisement'
My girl was good all week.
She was doing big things.
Now comes her reward.
Mushrooms from Leningrad -
My favorite thing.
Mushrooms from Leningrad,
yeah, yeah...
The express train comes in Monday.
My friend won't bring us booze,
he doesn't smoke or drink
but is a computer nerd.
His mushrooms
will blow your mind.
You missed a good film Tuesday.
The film was pretty shitty,
but I was flying high.
Oh man, how I love mushrooms!
'Dried Mushrooms
from St. Petersburg. '
- So what's essential for you?
- Same as for you.
I'm leaving if you say 'Oxygen. '
Don't think I'm dumber than you.
- Then what is it?
- You first.
It's crass and embarrassing.
- You go first.
- Same for me.
You start and I'll finish.
In school you probably played doctor
- with a girl.
- Yes, and you?
- Conscience.
- It's the same for me.
- Conscience.
- Same for me.
- Conscience.
- Same for me.
Track 10
Where Would I Be
Where would I be
if a nurse didn't smack me
when I was born,
and make me gasp oxygen
from pain and surprise?
Where would I be?
Where would I be
if they didn't pull me
from my mother's sliced womb?
Where would I be?
Where would I be if my mother
didn't sleep with my father
on the hospital bed
where he lay with pneumonia
and she worked as a nurse.
Where would I be?
Where I would be
if my mom didn't work as a nurse
and my father
didn't wear a scarf in the spring.
Where would I be?
How strange if mother
and father didn't exist.
Where would I be?
How strange...
Where would I be
if I did not exist?
Very strange...
I don't know. I really don't know.
But without my mother and father
I would have been
in prison by thirty.
That's right,
I am sure of that!
It's very strange.
If I weren't here,
where would I be?
What would it be like?
That better place?
Maybe with those
who were not here before?
Maybe among those
who aren't here yet?
Those who haven't breathed
oxygen yet,
who have not hated their parents,
never had an abortion,
never went on strike,
or blasphemed?
Maybe I would've been happy there,
in a place without oxygen famine,
where water is not sold
in plastic bottles?
Where no aerosol cloud
hangs over the sky.
Where ice does not melt on end
and turf bogs do not burn
and choke our lungs,
lungs created by God
to take in oxygen.
It has been said: 'By their fruits
shall ye know the trees. '
Then what can I say
about the tree called 'God? '
If it were written, 'A corrupt tree
bringeth forth evil fruit' -
- what does this mean?
- I am a fruit of this tree,
and by me people shall know
if the tree is corrupt.
This fruit shall be judged
by the tree.
Look at me;
I am the fruit of a heavenly tree.
A heavenly tree
brings forth heavenly fruit.
Yesterday I was
at a party with a girl
and you know what I did to her?
The tree called 'God' is heavenly.
I am the fruit. People
shall know the tree by me.
A corrupt tree
bringeth forth evil fruit.
The fruit it will bring
shall be heavenly too.
Fruit such as I
comes from a tree such as I
'Ye shall know
them by their fruits. '
Fruit contains 'oxygen':
Not the O2
that fills the tanks of sea divers
but the oxygen
we have talked about here.
My God is terrible
if I am the fruit of the tree
and people will know it by me.
Oxygen, without which
angels and saints
never take a step.
That is why I say to Him:
'For the love of God,
forgive me
and don't take my breath.
I have asthma,
but to hell with that! '
All of creation
breathes oxygen...
I only ask
that the oxygen flow not be cut.
Earth's intricate,
controversial life
was created for oxygen.
It would be good to breath oxygen
after death
and not the stale shit
you inhale at the visa office.
'Ye shall know
them by their fruits. '
