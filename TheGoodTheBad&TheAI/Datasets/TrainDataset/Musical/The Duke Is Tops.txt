Candy, drinks,
candy cigarettes,
Chewing gum candy,
cigarettes, cigars.
Now calm down, Ethel,
you're as nervous as a filly
In her first race.
Are you telling me?
Come on!
Get a move on ya.
Get to your places.
Oh, nearly missed
the opening, eh?
Now, the next time you're fired.
All right, take your place.
Keep you pretty
busy, don't they Sam?
These dames are gettin' worse.
Eaten' too regularly.
All their wrinkles
are coming out.
Where's Duke?
Oh, he's on the other side.
But you better hurry.
It's about curtain time.
You have to knock 'em
dead tonight, honey.
The house is packed.
That's great, Duke.
Now perhaps you'll get
back some of the money
You so foolishly
put in your show.
Foolish?
Why, Sugar, that's
what I've been working
For, to have a show of
our own with you a star.
You're sweet, Baby.
My lips, my makeup
you'll ruin them.
All right, but you'll
pay double after the show.
Oh, you.
Shh.
Silence!
Places!
Got a gal
down in Dixieland,
Makes my heart beat
to beat the band.
Here's the train
trestles over them.
Get away boys I've
got this .
Blackberry baby
I'm coming to you.
Blackberry baby
I'm headed to you.
get the band.
Blackberry baby you're mine.
Blackberry baby
ain't got a thistle.
I'll be traveling
sharp as a whistle.
I won't be satisfied
'til I am by your side.
Blackberry baby you're mine.
You laugh and I laugh
when we get together.
You step and I step
and  ever.
Blackberry baby,
you are my honey.
Blackberry baby the sun
is sunin'.  got
To be right there
with you and me.
Blackberry baby you're mine.
Blackberry baby your
smile is largest.
Blackberry baby your
gorgeous.
When
.
Blackberry baby, you're mine.
Welcome to Dixie, here is your
lady, all of the South, man,
Welcomes you baby.
We're here to satisfy,
Watching our own tonight.
Blackberry baby, you're mine.
That Andrews girl's got
plenty of what it takes.
I can give her a big break.
Mason, I can't figure
what your objection is.
My objection is
that it would ruin
The lives of two
fine young people.
Look, Mason, how much do
you pay that whole troupe?
A $1,500 a week guarantee?
Surely not more.
Six months from now she could
make that much by herself.
You're just a
sentimental old fool.
Maybe so, but I've
watched those kids
Grow up on this circuit.
Duke gave up a promising stage
career to push Ethel ahead.
Oh, he's done a
fine job of it too.
Next season she'll be the
biggest attraction we have.
Out here in the sticks,
what'll it get her?
You and I have
made a small beginning.
Don't know what our
fate is going to be.
Chances are we'll get
what we're deserving.
We will be the tops,
just wait and see.
I know you remember
all I've told you.
We'll see our dreams through.
You remember.
We'll work hard together
while we're dreaming,
Our plans have meaning.
I know you remember.
Fine cars, luxury, we'll
have more than these.
Don't care what people say.
We stay together.
Look at that personality,
she's a cinch for the big time.
You believe me
win or lose, I'm with you.
You hear that voice?
That's what they're buying.
I know you remember.
Did you wow!
Listen to that applause.
Come on you two lovebirds,
get out of the way.
Yes, sir, Mr. Stage Manager.
All right girls, in your place.
Let's go!
Don't rib him,
Duke, he's right,
And I have to make a change.
And I have to see Mr. Mason.
MASON: Duke, Mr.
Marshall is a talent
Scout for an Eastern circuit.
He thinks Ethel has
big-time possibilities.
Oh boy, that's great!
I've been waiting a lifetime
to hear news like that.
I knew it would come sometime.
When would you want us
to report, Mr. Marshall?
Us?
Whaddya mean, us?
You see, Duke, Mr. Marshall
wasn't figuring on you.
He wants Ethel to do a single.
A single?
Alone?
"The Bronze Nightingale,"
what an angle!
Sensational!
What publicity!
My kind of a build up
and she's in the bag.
You can tag along
if you want to.
Tag along?
I don't think you
understand Mr. Marshall.
We've always been together,
always hope to be.
I studied Ethel, taught her,
brought out the best in her.
It would be a great
chance for her.
Chance?
Why, it's the break
of a lifetime.
What's her talent
getting her here?
I know all that, but
I produced her show.
Producers are a dime
a dozen in New York.
Well I wouldn't be the
first one to crash in.
Why, I've heard...
A lot of fairy tales.
Ever been to New York?
No.
Then I'll tell you
what it would be like.
In and out of offices, nothing
today, come back tomorrow.
Just butting your head
up against a stone wall.
It would break your
heart and hers.
You wouldn't want to stand
in her way, would you?
Stand in her way?
Of course not.
New York is her dish.
Think of her in lights.
"Ethel Andrews, The
Bronze Nightingale."
A new star is born.
Gaiety, glamour,
she's entitled to that
And I can get them all for her.
What can you do?
The, ah, show just
broke, gentlemen.
Good night.
Good house for
the opening night.
Isn't she beautiful?
And can she sing!
Why, she's a whole show.
Come on, it's late.
Let's go.
It's a surprise from Duke.
With his usual card.
Ain't Duke a prince?
Ella, the Duke is tops!
He's giving me a chance
to do a number next week,
And I sure have been
rehearsing hard.
You've been holding
out on me, huh?
You know better than that.
Well, come on let's see it.
Well, here it goes.
Ella.
Ella, I want to speak to Ethel.
I'm practically gone.
Duke Darling,
what's the matter?
Oh, I guess I've
been kind of selfish,
Keeping you on this
small-time stuff
When you belong on Broadway.
Dear, you'll be a
dreamer all your life
And I wouldn't
have you different,
But don't you know that
if Broadway is for us
We'll get there?
Marshall, a talent scout for
an Eastern booking circuit
Has been watching you.
He thinks you've
got what it takes.
Ethel, we show people
live and strive
For one goal, the big stage,
and when opportunity knocks,
We've got to answer.
It's your chance, Kid, take it.
Without you, Duke?
Don't say it, Honey.
I'll never tell
you anything that
Isn't right, because,
well, you remember.
Here are the
reports, Mr. Mason.
Thanks.
Oh, hello, Mr. Davis.
Hello, Gladys.
Hi ya, Mr. Mason.
Well, Duke, you broke the
season's house records.
That's fine.
How about Ethel?
Have you made up your mind yet?
Sure, but she
hasn't made up hers.
I've been arguing with her
for the past two weeks.
She just laughs at the
idea of our splitting,
Says it's ridiculous.
Sometimes the surgeon
has to cut deep and hurt,
But it's for the patient's good.
MARSHALL: New York is her dish.
The Bronze Nightingale.
A new star is born.
Publicity, glamour, gaiety.
MASON: Sometimes the surgeon
has to cut deep and hurt,
But it's for the patient's good.
Gee, it's been a
swell two weeks.
I'm so glad for Duke's sake.
DUKE: Good evening, Ethel.
Yes, Duke come on in.
We've just about
finished packing.
I'm so glad you've given up that
silly idea of our separating.
You couldn't stand it?
Suppose you think
of me for a change.
Remember that?
Our contract.
DUKE: Now listen, Ethel,
I've tried to reason with you
For the past two weeks,
tried to be kind,
But you wouldn't listen.
Now I'll tell you
something, I can
Make myself a piece
of money out of that.
Here, take a look.
$5,000
Sure, I can cash in on this
contract, and I need the dough.
So, that's all I mean to
you, dollars and cents.
I don't think I ever
knew you until now.
Laugh's on me I guess.
Here, you forget my
part of the contract.
Now you can collect.
Well I'm glad you
decided to be sensible.
I'll be seeing you sometime.
Lots of luck.
And she never knew
me, until now.
Ethel, Ethel.
Duke!
You're a great guy,
but I'm not going
To let you get away with this.
It's the best
thing for her, El.
Best thing?
I'm going right back
and tell the truth.
Listen, Ella, you've
got the promise
Not to say a word, because
well, you remember.
What?
Hold the wire.
Come in.
Where do you go next week?
Say, you pay the last half
of this when it happens,
And that's a season's
work these days.
Where do we go next week!
Yes?
Good morning, Mr. Lake.
Ah, remember me?
I'm Duke Davis, I used
to do a single for you.
So did a lot of other hams.
No, I don't remember you.
It has been a long time, but
say, I've got a brand new act.
Oh, sure, I know.
New gags, classy
songs, swell wardrobe.
I hear that every day,
I know it by heart.
It's got whiskers on it.
Nothing for you.
I guess you heard that before.
Anyway, in case
you don't know it,
Vaudeville is as dead as
the last year's woman's hat.
About all I'm
looking for is girl
Acts for the picture houses.
Well that's great, Mr. Lake.
You know, I'm a
producer and, and that
Would be right up my alley.
And that alley's
so full of producers
The Health Department
is kicking.
Say, I do remember you,
you and that Andrews dame.
She was a good
meal ticket for you
Once, ought to be
a better one now.
She's a big-time hit.
Why don't you hang
a touch on her?
I'm thinking of doing
the same to you, my love.
DUKE: There you are
Mr. Mason, a brand new
Show I just finished writing it!
I hope you got
something here, my boy.
It's a wow!
It's got everything!
Heard from Ethel?
No.
But look, I can
use my old people.
They know my work and I
know what they can do.
Of course, you'll
have to stake me.
I'm broke.
If you're as good
as you use to be,
We'll manage to
put on your show.
That's swell, kids.
That'll be all today.
Wait a minute!
And that don't mean 10:30 or
five after, it means 10:00!
All right .
How's it shaping
up to you, Sam?
It's a lily, but, Duke, you
always put on good shows.
I hope so.
You don't have to say
it, Mr. Mason, I know.
The show did a nosedive.
The breaks of our game, my boy.
But I know where it's weak.
Say, a couple of new
specialties and tighten up
On that comedy,
why, I can doctor up
This show in two shakes
of a pawn broker's head.
I'm sorry, Duke,
but my bankroll
Just can't stand
any more strain.
Well that's that.
Anyway, thanks for
giving me a break.
I'm sorry.
Sorry for the flop.
Forget it, Duke.
What did the boss, say?
Ah, Duke!
We'll show him this
ain't the only circuit.
No, Sam, get yourself a job.
You can handle a stage
better than any man I know.
I ain't gonna leave you.
Yes you are, because
I can't pay you.
Here, I'm splitting
the bankroll with you.
Good luck, Sam.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Psst.
Psst.
Oh, as I live and breathe and
gargle my tonsils, Duke Davis.
Doctor Dorando,
the old boy himself.
How are ya?
Riding the quest.
Favored by fame and
followed by fortune.
And how is the bright star
of the theatrical firmament?
The scintillating,
shimmering satellite to the...
Save it, Doc.
What are you
peddling these days?
Peddling?
A vile word, my boy.
I am engaged in revealing
to suffering humanity
This peerless remedy,
this amazing healer.
Doctor Dorando's
Universal Elixir.
That's fine.
Sit down.
How's business?
Ah, marvelous,
stupendous, colossal.
I might even add that
businesses is, ah, fair.
Ham and eggs, turn
my eggs over, please.
Um, Miss.
Nothin' doing, Mister.
This is no drugstore, you've
stuck us for plenty already.
Money talks from now on.
Order of ham and eggs, over.
Ah, Duke, how about
making that order double?
Sure.
Oh, ah duplicate the
order, young woman,
And keep my eggs honest...
Lookin' me in the face.
Another order ham
and... sunny up.
Finished, Doc?
Alas, yes.
Ah, Duke, a thousand thanks.
Perhaps you will accept a slight
return for your hospitality.
That's all right, Doc,
you know you're welcome.
Come clean, now.
Up against it?
Well, now, I, I am suffering
a temporary setback, but, ah,
Come over to my
headquarters and we
Will discuss about
this at length.
Oh, well, have you the time?
I understand, come on, Doc.
DOC: Why, no Duke, I haven't
been north of Alabama
In two or three years.
That's why I haven't
seen you before, Doc.
Oh, Duke, I want you to
meet, ah, Prince Alakazzo,
My faithful companion.
Dippy Dodds, hi ya.
Yes, sir, Mr. Davis.
How are you?
Oh, so you know The Prince.
Dippy was property man on one
of the Toby shows I was with.
Yes sir, I had a
job in them days.
Excuse me, Doc, ah, when
does I eat, or doesn't I?
Tush, tush, my boy, always
thinking of your stomach.
Yes sir, thinking.
Step right inside,
Duke, step right in.
Ah, here, here's $0.15.
Here, go and get
yourself a good meal.
Say, Doc, ah, you didn't
rob a bank, did ya?
Ah, run along
boy, you annoy me.
I wish to speak with Mr. Davis.
Make yourself comfortable, Duke.
Thanks, Doc, I was just
looking things over.
Nothing like having a
place of your own, is it?
Ah, home, sweet home.
Sit down, Duke, sit down.
Oww!
Get thee from behind me, Satan.
As you have
doubtlessly observed,
A financial
stringency does exist.
In fact, I'm disposing
of the remnants
Of my stock to keep
this inner man alive.
So you're broke.
Well, no, no, not exactly.
Only a very, very small
matter separates me
From a cool million.
Yeah?
What is that?
Ah, $15.
Listen, Doc, cut out the
act, give me the lowdown.
What's put you behind
the eight ball?
Well now, the
wholesale house has
Cut off my credit and business...
Has been rotten.
Exactly.
The suckers... ah, that
is that customers... ah,
Don't fall like they used to.
Ah ha, still giving
them that same old spiel
And expect them to form
a line with their money
In their hands.
Well, now, I guess
that's about it.
But it's a good
spiel, it always was.
That's out now,
what you've got to do
Is entertain them, give
them something for nothing.
No, no, no, no, Duke.
That's against
all my principles.
But, ah, elucidate.
What you need is showmanship,
and that means Duke Davis.
I'll bring your show
up to the minute.
How 'bout it?
Son, we're partners, 50-50.
Ahh, this speaks of
brighter and better days
For old Doc Dorando.
First of all, I'd talk
about the customers.
Forget the medicine,
something like this.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me
Great pleasure to
announce the return of...
Famous Doctor Dorando to
your thriving community.
He brings you the benefits
of a lifelong dedication
To the study of the
alleviation of human suffering.
The doctor's happiness,
naturally, is your happiness.
Isn't that so, Doctor?
Oh, yes, yes indeed.
To be sure.
But my friends, in order to
be happy, you must be healthy.
Ain't that the truth.
Mister, I've got a powerful
misery in my left shoulder.
Ahh, a very serious condition,
but the doctor's Universal
Elixir will make
you a healthy man.
Have no fear, step
right this way.
Yes, sir.
Thank you!
Now, ahem, before I tell you
of this wonderful discovery,
This universal elixir,
let us have music.
Professor.
Ladies and gentlemen, Professor
Duckbill, wizard of the strings
Will now entertain.
Strike it up, Professor.
Looks like business
is going to be good.
Sheriff, I ain't
gonna stand for it.
Them fellows take all
the money out of town.
I don't see what I
can do about it, Large.
He's paid his license.
That so?
Sheriff, I'm not going to
put any pressure on you,
But just remember they ain't
election, that's
All.
Yes indeedy, yes indeed.
Good day.
You sap, he's fixed.
Very well your highness.
The Prince hopes you will all
get what is coming to you.
I sure hope we don't
get what's coming to us.
Have no fear, there'll
be plenty for all.
And now let me tell you of this
wonderful elixir compounded
Of rare herbs, gathered
from the ends of the earths.
From the icy wastes
of the polar regions,
The blazing heat of the Sahara
Desert, regardless of cost.
A pack of lies.
I don't believe a word, come
on, Sheriff, I'll show them.
Those are strong words, sir.
Are you prepared to back 'em up?
I sure am, as a
respectable druggest, I...
Ahh, just as I thought.
Friends, this man sells
you a bottle of medicine,
Charges you a dollar.
Maybe he cures you,
and maybe he doesn't.
Ain't so, I know this
stuff ain't no good.
You hold your lip
lied, Smithers.
I drunk two bottles of your
medicine for my sciatica
And I'm painin' yet.
That wasn't for drinkin',
it was for rubbin'.
Thank you, lady, thank you.
But, need I go on?
I see you get my point.
There is no guarantee that what
this man sells you and takes
Your good money for
will cure your ailments.
Now then, if you are
suffering from sciatica,
Cold in the head, headache,
or any other of the ailments
That might come to
plague you, just
See what one bottle,
one bottle mind you,
Of Doctor Dorando's
marvelous Universal Elixir
Will do for you.
Hold on a minute.
Will that there stuff grow hair?
Grow hair, sir?
I'm glad you brought that up.
I ask you to look
at the good doctor
And notice that
luxuriant growth of hair.
Why, four years ago
the doctor fell ill
With sinfaletosis
of the metatarsal,
A very dangerous disease.
And all of his hair fell out,
but thanks to the Universal
Elixir but why go on, why go on?
Doctor show them what Universal
Elixir has done for you.
I knew it, I knew it.
It's a fake.
Now, Sheriff, do your duty.
I'll give you just five minutes
to be one mile out of town.
Ah, Doc, ah, we're leaving.
So I anticipated.
Ah, Joe, Joe.
Move those chairs.
Start packing.
Ah, Dippy, hook up the car!
Well, it looks like Old Man
Jinks is with me permanent.
Don't let a little
thing like that getcha.
Why, when I really
bear down, we'll
Be selling more stuff than any
medicine show in the business.
No, Duke, it ain't no use.
Forget it, Doc.
I've got more ideas
than a clock has ticks.
And the first idea
is in the future
We're going to glue
that wig on, tight.
Ooh.
For Pete's sake.
Hey there.
Imp of darkness and
demon of disaster.
Smells like the coffee's ready.
Now, for the eats.
Say, Joe, here's a good spot to
turn off the main drag, 'cause
Them folks back
there sure hostile.
Looks kind of rough to me.
Yes, but I ain't
taking no chances.
OK by me.
Suffering .
Doc, the place is on fire.
Here put your foot up here, Doc.
Let me get that out for
you.  Doc,
The water thing ain't working.
What no water?
No.
Get some blankets.
Ok, quick.
Quick, Doc!
Dippy!
Joe!
Dippy!
Dippy!
Dippy!
No!
Get out of here!
Let's get out of here!
Come on.
Come on.
Ha ha ha.
Some christening, Doc!
Through fire and water,
we can't fail now!
Oh,
romance should
Keep it's
.
Match that the true
love's trespasses
Dissipation only ends in defeat.
Don't let our love
song turn into a blues.
As long as life lasts, let's
be true to one another.
Did I steer you right?
She's got it, hasn't she?
our hearts
with sad melody.
True love will guide us
through stormy weather.
Everyone should be
true to his own.
Let's make sure before
this chance is flown.
We won't disagree
on many things.
Just get along together like
a romance in the spring.
Our love both must not be
lost on it's .
Don't let our love
song turn into a blues.
Everyone should be
true to his own.
Oh, let's make sure before
this chance is flown.
We won't disagree
on anything just
Get along together like
a romance in the spring.
Our love both must not be
lost on it's .
Don't let our love
song turn into a blues.
I like her in Broadway,
well, more than like her.
She'll wow 'em at
your Century Club.
Bring her up to my
office in the morning.
That a girl, Ethel.
I knew you'd do it.
Thank you, folks.
Thank you, thank you.
And now folks, I wonder if you'd
mind stepping down a little bit
Closer, so I won't have
to... not too close ladies.
The kerosene from
the lamp is leaking
And is liable to
get on your clothes.
Friends, I'm here
to introduce Doctor
Dorando's Universal Elixir.
The average adult... by adult I
mean a person who has stopped
Growing at both ends and
started in the middle.
The minute a man like that
get's sick he runs to a doctor
And the doctor tells
him... which reminds me,
I had a patient come to me, a
little fellow with a glass eye.
He didn't tell me it was
a glass eye, of course.
It happen to come out
during the conversation.
Ain't he a .
Ah ha, you see it.
He didn't.
Anyway, this man went
to another doctor,
A foreigner, an alienist.
This doctor told him, you
are not going to get well,
But to make sure you're
not going to get well,
I will call in another doctor.
Now, the other doctor
told him that he
Was threatened with paralysis.
Why do you laugh, brother?
Don't you realize it's an
awful thing to be paralyzed?
Sure is, you feel so
rotten in the morning.
I don't know you, my friend,
but I think you show poor taste
To laugh at so
serious a subject.
Anyway, this man
finally came to us
And Doctor Dorando, whom I
shall introduce presently,
Diagnosed his case
as stomach trouble.
Friends, do you realize that the
death rate on stomach trouble
A year averages one
death per person.
Ah, you may laugh,
but that's a fact.
Doctor Dorando put
this man on a milk diet
Until he was strong enough
to take his medicine.
And that man would be alive
today it he hadn't a...
Died.
Oh no my friend, if
he hadn't held out
The Saturday night's
paycheck on his wife.
Now before I go on with my
talk I have a treat for you.
I should like to introduce
the Dorando and Davis
World famous quartet,
The Cats and the Fiddle.
Come along and swing
it for them, boys.
He's the man
that smokes that jive.
That jive will take
you for a dive.
One sip you will arrive.
When you smoke
that killin' jive.
It will make you very tall.
Seems that if you're
going to fall,
Knock yourself out for a ride.
I mean that killin' jive.
You will think
you'll blow your top.
Baby you start laughing
and you can't stop.
Now won't you give
him a smile 'cause
He's a sad man not bad man.
Everything will seem so funny.
Darkest days will seem so sunny.
That feeling will arrive when
you smoke that killin' jive.
Sad man not bad man.
Everything will seem so funny.
Darkest days will seem so sunny.
That feeling will arrive when
you're a high man,
Man, you're in the sky, man.
You're on the rip, man.
You'll been so mellow,
just like a jello
When you smoke
that killin' jive.
Hey, Duke sure knows
how to get 'em, don't he?
You telling me?
And now for the real
treat of the evening.
It gives me a great
deal of pleasure
To introduce Doctor Dorando, the
discoverer of Universal Elixir,
Himself in person...
Doctor Dorando.
Yes, it's a man that
has done more for mankind
With his Universal
Elixir than all
The doctors in the
world put together.
What he has done to
others, he can do to you.
The doctor will sit
by my side to verify
Any and all statements
that I may make.
Is that so, Doctor?
Oh, yes, yes indeed.
Friends, as I look
over your smiling faces
The thought comes to me
that a lot of those smiles
May be covering up
sickness and suffering.
Maybe some of you are
suffering with rheumatism.
Here are some copper
neutralizing rings
Guaranteed... you do guarantee
them don't you Doctor?
Oh, yes, indeed.
Guaranteed to keep
away rheumatism.
Just think friends, we're
giving away free these marvelous
Manifestations of
modern science.
And here, here are some
chestnuts all the way
From the land of
the East Indies,
The land of mystic and magic.
Put one of these
in your hip pocket
And you'll never be
bothered with sciatica.
Mister, I haven't
got a hip pocket.
A healthy lady
like you will never
Be bothered with sciatica.
And these chestnuts too
are free with every bottle
Of Doctor Dorando's Universal
Elixir at $1.00 a bottle.
Neighbors, we only
have a limited supply,
You won't all be able to get
a bottle, we haven't got them.
Ouch, my corn.
Give a bottle to the
lady with the corns.
I said "give."
It's free to you, madame.
Now I tell you what I'm going
to do, when I ring this bell,
The sale will start.
When I ring it again,
the sale will stop,
Not another bottle will be sold.
All right folks, have
your dollars ready.
All right, here you are.
Here's your neutralizer and
Eastern India chestnuts.
Take your time, folks.
Take your time, no rush,
enough for everybody.
All right, don't rush now.
Don't rush.
Those who suffer
from acid indigestion,
Gas, sour stomach, cramps,
sciatica, lumbago, rheumatism,
Gout, swollen joints, mumps,
dandruff, fallen arches.
Or, if any of your family,
or livestock, are sick
Universal Elixir will cure them.
I don't care what the matter
is, one bottle will put new life
And vigor into those
old bodies of yours.
Give me two bottles.
Two bottles sold to Methuselah.
No, Dippy.
I'm sorry, sir.
Only one bottle of this
precious elixir to a person.
Now folks, time's up.
Say, give me a
bottle of this stuff.
All right, folks
be right with you here.
Fair, I've already
bought that bottle.
Had my money out and everything.
I'm sorry, neighbor,
but the bell just rang.
But he passed me up,
I had my money out.
I came on  to
get a bottle of medicine.
Come on, Doc, let
me have a bottle.
I'm sorry folks, but
if I let that man have
A bottle after the bell rang,
everybody will want one.
Brothers, you're
making it's tough on me.
The only bottles I have
left are those set aside
For our next town, Centerville.
Let me have a word
with the good doctor.
It's a sellout, Doc, we
could pedal all we got.
The doctor has agreed
to my suggestion,
And to show you our hearts
are in the right place... Joe,
Break out that lot
for Centerville
And start selling again.
I don't want to leave your
town with any hard feelings.
Don't rush, there'll
be elixir for all.
And remember, a dollar spent
now means $100 saved later.
Don't miss this
wonderful opportunity,
You'll never regret it,
you'll never miss the money.
What is money
compared to health?
Hey, give me another bottle.
Scram, you bought
five bottles already.
Ah, Duke I've been
thinking perchance
We should invade the metropolis.
No, Doc.
They've forgotten more
tricks than we'll ever learn.
Doing all right as
we are, aren't we?
Ah, yes, indeed.
That vision of prophecy was
mine when we encountered
Each other only a
short year or so ago.
Ah, how time has
flown on golden wings,
And tonight we have reached
the pinnacle of our success.
That's a good line
you swing, Doc.
RADIO ANNOUNCER: Station WEDK
New York City now brings you
Your nightly hot shots from
Hot Spot Buyer Spotter.
PROGRAM HOST: Good evening
ladies and gentlemen.
This is a spotter
with a spot of news.
Hottest hot spot, Ferdie
Fenton's Century Club,
Has as cooled off after
the first presentation
Of a new review featuring the
erstwhile Bronze Nightingale,
Ethel Andrews, who still wobbles
a swell pair of pipes, but is
Nixed when it comes to
filling the heavy spot
On the Broadway biggie.
Some of the blame,
or maybe all of it,
Pins on Fenton, for trying
to rush the gal from sticks
To steeples in a
few weeks and one
Marshall who authorized
this one should
Be forced to eat raw egg...
Look, Mr. Fenton, I
can dope this show.
Not on my money.
I must have been dope when
I let you talk me into it.
That girl's a
specialty, not a star.
Well, why not go back
to her first setup?
Remember when you first
saw her in Philadelphia?
Fill her as a single.
Remember her rave notices?
Remember the variety?
Yes, I remember
and I'm thinking
About what variety
will do to me now.
As a producer, Marshall,
your a good agent.
Back to the sticks, I'm through.
From pinnacle to pit to
bottomless pit, that's me.
Don Dorando's
wonderful discovery
Is headed for a drainpipe
instead of , and all
Because of that devilish device.
That broadcasting operators,
why, I have a mind to bust...
You understand, Doc, Don't ya?
Say, Duke, can I drive
you down to the station?
No, Dippy, thanks.
I'd rather walk.
I want to be by myself.
Well, so long, fellows.
ELLA: Oh, so that does
mean something to you.
Where we heading, honey?
South?
No, we're moving to
another apartment.
We can't afford all this now.
A fortune teller told me
once that I was a, a cyclist.
A what?
Somebody who can see things
that some people can't.
Oh, you mean a psychic.
That's it, a cyclist.
Well, I've been having notions
about somebody down South.
And I'm trying to
forget the South.
You're kidding yourself, honey.
Anyway, Duke's
down there and I've
Got a hunch he's in trouble.
Maybe he's broke.
Not much.
Your forgetting a little matter
of $5,000 he sold me for.
Now, you listen to me.
I've been hiding a lie and
it's time somebody came clean.
If Duke won't, I will.
Then I don't want to
hear anything about it...
You're going to hear
what I've got to say
And it's all about him.
Duke Davis double
crossed himself for you.
He wrote that $5,000
check and didn't
Take a dime for Marshall.
He thought he was
standing in your way.
Ella, we're not moving.
We're sending the trunks
to Pennsylvania Station.
We're heading South!
There's the baggage smasher.
Gosh!
Maybe I am a cyclist!
We were just talking about you.
Well, am I invited in?
Duke, I just found out
what you did for me.
And I just found out
what they did to you.
All I want is 15 minutes
with that Fenton fellow.
Forget him, Duke.
You can't hurt him,
it wasn't his fault.
Hurt him?
I'm going to do him good.
And you're going to wow
'em at that Century Club.
Nothing can stop us now.
PROGRAM HOST: And
here's another bit
Of news from a local hot spot.
Ferdie Fenton whose last Century
Club show went sour on him,
Wasted no time in
calling in a doctor, one
Duke Davis, a newcomer
from the sticks.
The medicine is said to be new
faces, novel ideas and... well
Ferdie, you're either a genius
or a glutton for punishment.
Anyway, good luck with
your new producer...
