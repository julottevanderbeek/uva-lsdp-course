Quinn's pregnant, and Puck's the father,
but Quinn's decided...
to give the baby to Terri,
who's not pregnant, just pretending to be.
- It was her sister Kendra's idea.
- We're gonna have to get you a baby.
- Also, Ken proposed to Emma, and she said...
- Yes.
Oh, and Sue got Figgins
to make her co director of the Glee Club.
- Hey, kids.
- And that's what you missed on...
How did this happen?
I look like a crazy person.
I didn't know the vein on my neck
could stick out like that.
since the decongestant incident where Figgins
brought Sue in to co-run the Glee Club.
I'm so ashamed of myself.
She's turned me into her.
God, it feels good to finally pop that zit
known as Will Schuester.
Look at us.
We're even fighting in our voice-overs.
I guess things really
started to fall apart a couple days ago...
right after Figgins
called us into his office for a sit-down.
Sue, Schue, I called you here...
to get the temperature of the Glee Club.
- Great.
- I wanted to get a progress report...
on how you're working together
as co directors.
- Well, I think...
- In my opinion... No, go ahead.
- No, you.
- Okay.
- Please.
- Principal Figgins.
- Uh, things couldn't be going more smoothly.
- I couldn't agree more.
I don't want to hear any reports...
of either of you trying to curry favor
from the children.
- Am I clear?
- Oh, absolutely!
As we head into sectionals,
I wanna get some feedback.
Like, what kind of stuff
you guys would like to be doing.
Is there anything... any music in particular...
that you guys wanna do?
Can we maybe try something a little more black?
It's Glee Club, not Crunk Club.
Don't make me take you to the carpet.
Fantastic! Thank you, Mercedes, Kurt.
Duly noted. Anything else?
I can pop and lock.
Not really what we're goin' for, Mike...
but... noted, noted, yes.
- And no pitting the kids against one another.
- Never.
I wanna pit these kids against one another.
Am I clear?
The minority students
don't feel like they're being heard.
Ah. Chink in the armor, huh?
I am going to create an environment
that is so toxic...
no one will want to be a part of that club.
Like the time I sold my house
to a nice, young couple...
and I salted the earth in the backyard...
so that nothing living could grow there
for a hundred years.
Because they tried to get me
to pay their closing costs.
Sectionals is coming up.
What are your co director plans?
Uh, we were actually...
Uh, we're each gonna direct our own number.
And we'll be flipping a coin
to see who goes first.
- It'll be very civilized, very sportsmanlike, so...
- Mmm. Yes.
This arrangement is pleasing to all.
- Isn't it?
- It's great.
Now, let's hug it out.
- I'd rather not do that.
- I really don't see that happening.
This meeting doesn't end
until I see your bodies touching.
It's a technique I learned last week
at my leadership seminar.
I will destroy you.
I'm about to vomit down your back.
It's on.
- I'm freaking out.
- Everything's gonna be fine.
Relax. At your age, there's very little chance
of anything being wrong.
Awesome.
It is gonna be a little cool to the touch.
Can you just be careful with my uniform?
All right.
Speaking of your ages,
have you two given any thought...
to what you're gonna do after the baby is born?
Whatever Quinn wants is fine.
Well, if it makes a difference, it's a girl.
- Hmm. Hey.
- Hey.
The baby's fine. Uh, no mutations or anything.
Not even any cool ones.
Thanks for taking us today.
I was too freaked out to drive.
Yeah. No problem.
Hey. You doing all right?
Um, no.
I mean, how am I supposed to
take care of a real person?
My mom won't even let me have fish.
I thought Quinn wanted
to give the baby up for adoption.
For now, but we both know that's not my call.
This sucks.
Get all the stress and the worry
and none of the control.
It's cool, Mr. Schue.
You wouldn't understand.
The independent polling company
in my Dockers...
has determined you're the hottest girl
in this school.
- Ew.
- Have you been reading my blog?
Of course not. You're a gossip monger...
and your blog is nothing but trash and lies,
many of them about me.
You'll be happy to know the one I'm working on
right now has nothing to do with you...
or your rumored lust for Jew-fros.
It's about Quinn Fabray.
Word on the street is that she's in trouble.
- Where did you hear that?
- Are you denying it?
Yes.
Because the same birdie
told me you're heartbroken...
Finn Hudson didn't choose you
to carry his litter.
- What is it gonna take for you to not run the story?
- Well...
Ladies' choice. Heads.
Tricksters Trick Store? This is Sue Sylvester.
You got any of those double-headed coins?
Heads.
Awesome. All right.
Following students have been selected...
for a special elite Glee Club called Sue's Kids.
- Hold on. We agreed not to split up the group.
- Aw, come on, Will.
Give me a chance to do things Sue Sylvester's way.
Maybe with my proven leadership abilities...
I can help this pathetic group
of mouth breathers place at sectionals.
We can't even compete in sectionals
if we divide up the club, Sue.
- It's against the rules.
- Really? You need to crack open a book, William.
Here. I have.
Show Choir Rule Book. Page 24.
Provision 14. Second addendum.
However, not all members
must perform every song."
Fine. Hey, just go ahead,
take all the football players and your Cheerios.
All right, everybody. Listen up.
When you hear your name called,
cross over to my side of this black, shiny thing.
- That's called a piano, Sue.
- Santana!
Wheels! Gay kid! Come on! Move it!
Asian! Other Asian.
Aretha. And Shaft.
I don't want to participate in a group
that ignores the needs of minority students.
- You have got to be kidding me!
- I wouldn't kid about this.
And maybe that's your problem.
Bigotry is no laughing matter.
And that's how Sue sees it.
Outstanding.
I wanted to remind you to tell that Quinn girl...
not to vaccinate in the hospital.
I'm pretty sure those shots
made my kids stupid.
Oh. I guess I could use
the vaccination money...
to buy the organic crib mattress.
I mean, what are the chances
of the baby getting polio, right?
Bye, Kendra.
- I hate you, Will!
- That was rude!
Don't take the stress of your workday
out on me.
I don't wanna take it out on you, Terri.
I just don't wanna feel as powerless
in my own home as I do at school.
I have to come home and listen to you making
major decisions about our son with your sister.
I haven't even felt the baby kick yet...
and the only time
I've ever been to an OB/GYN office...
was when I took Quinn and Finn
for the 10-week ultrasound.
You did? How's the baby?
Fine. It's a girl. That's not the point.
Well, what is the point, Will?
My point is that I am the father of that baby.
And I'm coming with you
to your next doctor's appointment.
So what did you have to do to get him to stop?
Let's just say I feel sorry for my dads...
'cause they're probably gonna have to dip into
my college fund to pay for intensive therapy.
- Whoa! Hard core.
- I don't mind.
- I did it to protect you.
- And Quinn.
- Of course.
- Yeah.
- We're all teammates.
- Hey, I gotta tell you.
You really are awesome.
I'm gonna make it up to you someday, I swear.
I need another pair.
- What's wrong with the ones I already gave you?
- Look.
- Uh, they still had the tag on them.
- Put those away!
I want Rachel Berry panties.
Okay. I expect delivery by tomorrow morning...
or the story of Quinn Fabray
and the stork goes wide.
I feel an urge to kiss you right now.
I'm just gonna go for it.
You stop it!
Okay. Sorry.
- I'm k-k-kind of nervous.
- I debated not even showing up.
I think it's gonna be great.
Did you catch Sue's Corner last night?
Sometimes people ask me, "Sue,
how come you're so sensitive to minorities?"
I'll tell you why.
Because I know firsthand how hard it is
to struggle as a minority in America today.
I'm 1/16th Comanche Indian.
In fact, I like minorities so much...
I'm thinkin' of movin' to California
to become one.
Hey, kids. Brought some
of my brass buddies with me.
Thought maybe they could
help us out a little bit. Okay.
So I selected a song that I think
will speak to the frustration you've felt...
under the failed leadership of Will Schuester.
"Hate on Me," an R & B song!
You like that? Yeah.
Changster, I wanna see some of that
pop and lock groove you're so famous for.
You go to town. And you, Mercedes.
- I want to see some Mariah hands.
- I can do that.
- Yeah!
- I think we g-got this one, Miss Sylvester.
All right. Well, we'll see. Hit it!

Sue. Hey, Sylvester, I'm talking to you.
Oh, hey, buddy. I thought I smelled failure.
Why'd you take the piano
when it was my time up with the kids?
A properly steam-cleaned piano
is the key to any successful music group.
You are undermining me
in front of these students.
Your delusions of persecution
are a telltale sign...
of early-stage paranoid schizophrenia.
Sue, I am not done talking to you.
What about all my sheet music?
My kids need that music.
Well, Will, the last thing your kids need
is chronic sinusitis...
from the mildew I feared
was infesting that old, moldy paper.
- So, what, you sent it away for some testing?
- Nah. Burned it.
That is it, Sue! This ends right here!
A cockfight. Fantastic.
We are here for these students.
Whatever problems we have,
we're gonna get 'em out in the open!
You wanna get real? You're right, Will.
I have been trying to destroy your club
with a conviction I can only call religious.
And you wanna know why?
Because I don't trust a man with curly hair.
I can't help picturing small birds
laying sulfurous eggs in there...
and I find it disgusting.
Oh, you are a terrible influence on these kids.
- You're dangerous. I think you
teach them the wrong lessons!
- I don't care what you think.
I have a legacy to protect, William,
and Glee Club is a part of that legacy.
And I will win.
If it means I have to
get you fired to do it, so be it.
Oh! Thanks, honey.
I wanna finish grading these papers first.
What, you think the kids weren't drunk
when they wrote 'em, hmm?
Listen, honey.
I've been a really crummy wife lately.
Uh, Terri, you're carrying my baby.
I have no right to expect anything
more than that from you.
No, that is my sister's marriage,
and I don't want it.
Anyway, listen.
Okay.
I think that I might be able to help you
with your problems at school.
Uh, thanks, Terri, but the last time
you helped out at school...
it didn't go over very well.
Eh...
Besides, this is serious.
I mean, Sue said she wouldn't rest
until she saw me fired.
All the more reason.
You gotta do whatever it takes, honey.
You gotta get down in the gutter
if you wanna win this.
Sue, a lot of our readers
at Cheerleading Today...
- I'm cutting you off. Is this a cover story?
- Yes.
Okay. This is all your readers need to know.
I'm all about empowerment.
I empower my Cheerios
to live in a state of constant fear...
by creating an environment
of irrational, random terror.
Speaking of which... Q! Here, now!
- Where are my Cheerios?
- Coach Sylvester, they're not academically eligible.
Mr. Schuester flunked them.
This is a travesty
of international proportions.
You are jeopardizing my Cheerios' role
as goodwill ambassadors...
and I have a call in to the president.
I have a Spanish quiz in which one
of your cheerleaders misspelled her name...
and answered every question
with a drawing of a sombrero.
You can't stand it. You can't stand
to see a woman in a position of power.
- That has nothing...
- Your psychosexual derangement
would be fascinating, Will...
Sue, Will did a little research.
According to our test records, most of
your cheerleaders are functionally illiterate!
- Oh, so what?
- And why, only last Friday, at the football game...
they tried to spell out "Go, team,"
and they spelled out "To game."
should have flunked Spanish...
and I, for one, am not gonna
be a part of it anymore.
Oh, Will, we all know about your devotion
to that dying language!
- Dying language?
- Let me break this down for you, okay?
I empower my Cheerios to be champions.
Do they go on to college?
I don't know. I don't care.
- See...
- Should they learn Spanish?
Sure, if they wanna become
dishwashers and gardeners.
But if they wanna be bankers
and lawyers and captains of industry...
the most important lesson
they could possibly learn...
is how to do a round off.
She is deranged.
You know, this all happened on your watch!
You have allowed this to go on for years.
Say something!
Oh, plea... Okay!
Sue, Will is correct. You're wrong.
- What?
- From now on, no free passes.
That's it! There.
- See you in Glee Club, Sue.
- Don't... touch me.
That is a lawsuit, mister!
What happened to our little agreement, huh?
Will I be uploading a certain video
to YouTube this afternoon?
Oh, Sue. I put it on YouTube myself,
and it only got two hits!
- Damn!
- Let me break it down for you. Nobody cares!
No! Not the children!
Move! Move! Move!
- Mmm.
- What is this?
Check it out.
I came up with a name
that I think would be good for the kid.
Eyes on your own test, Finn.
What's up now, Ronnie?
Anyway, then I read that Gwyneth Paltrow
named her kid Apple...
and I think that's so cool
'cause you know how much I love apples, right?
So I figured we should name our kid
something more original and poetic.
Then I came up with
the best baby name of all time.
- Drizzle!
- Drizzle?
Yeah. Yeah.
'Cause you know how awesome it is...
when it's just drizzling outside,
but it's not really raining...
so it smells like rain,
but you don't need an umbrella to go outside.
- Are you a moron?
- What?
We're not naming our baby Drizzle.
We're not naming our baby anything.
Finish your test, Finn.
Will you give me my test back?
- I just don't understand anything.
- That's not my problem.
You are so insensitive!
Bringing up baby names to me
when you know I don't want to keep it.
- I can't keep it.
- I know, but I don't get what
you expect me to do about it.
- Not have an opinion?
- Hey, this is happening to me too!
No, it's not!
You're not the one whose parents
will burn her like a witch if they find out.
Sometimes I wish you were
a little more like Rachel.
- Really?
- Yeah. She cares about my feelings.
She sticks up for me.
She sticks up for both of us.
She gave that Jacob kid
a pair of her underpants...
just to keep him from posting on his blog
about you being pregnant.
You think she did that for me?
- Just to be a good teammate?
- That's what she told me.
I know some guys cheat on their wives
or pregnant girlfriends.
Just don't do it with her.
Whoo! Hey! Ho!
Hey! Ho!

Whoo! Yeah.
I miss us all being together.
I hope we don't get in trouble
for our covert jam session.
If Sue catches us mingling, we're cooked.
She told me if I even talked to one of
Mr. Schue's kids, she would shave my head.
And I just can't rock that look.
Even Justin Timberlake is growing his fro back.
- Well, we gotta go, you guys.
- No!
Miss Sylvester is expecting us
in 10 minutes in the dance studio.
- Oh, man!
- Bye!
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye, white people.
- Sorry. Bye.
Hey! What are you guys doing here?
Just s-s-stopping by to say hello.
- Ah, it's great to see you guys.
- Bye!
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye, guys.
All right. Great news, guys.
Brought the band with me, and I think
that we have our number for sectionals.
Mr. Schue?
We don't like what this has become.
Don't you guys see?
That is how Sue wants you to feel.
Giving up doesn't help anyone but her.
Look, if it were up to me,
we would all perform together at sectionals.
But it's not up to me anymore, okay?
Sue's gonna do her song,
and we are gonna do ours.
Sue's Kids are singing about hate... literally.
So, I thought we would try a kinder approach.
All right. Finn and Rachel, come up here.
You're gonna take the leads.
Oh, I love this song. Okay. Follow my lead.
Don't wait for me.
So much for togetherness.
Guys, you guys really need
to practice this, all right?
Night and day, between classes.
It has to be letter-perfect.
- Okay?
- You got it, Mr. S. Hit it.
¶¶ Tell me how I'm supposed

¶¶ If I should die before I wake ¶¶
¶¶ It's 'cause you took my breath away ¶¶

Amazing, guys. Bull's-eye.
Excuse me. What about us?
You expect us
to just sway back here like props?
Say it for me again, word for word.
"What about us? You expect us
to just sway back here like props?"
Perfect. Then turn to the other two and say...
He clearly doesn't like minorities.
Can you imagine in this day and age
being discriminated against?
My goodness. The pain you must be feeling.
So your last name's Puckerman, huh?
- Shalom.
- Who knew?
And poor, sweet Brittany.
Oh, I know the Dutch are famous
for being a cold people...
but that's no excuse for treating you...
like some half-price hooker
in Amsterdam's famous Red Light District.
Well, all I can say is,
if you're serious about leaving Schuester...
Sue Sylvester's rainbow tent...
will gladly protect you
from his storm of racism.
- Hey, what's for dinner?
- Oh!
- Why don't you get something
from takeout, sweetie.
- Hey, listen.
I don't expect you to start cooking...
but on nights when you're home first, I think
it's appropriate for you to take care of dinner.
Wow, you're so forceful.
What's gotten into you?
You.
You were right. I stood up to Sue...
and now she's begging me for mercy.
Oh, I feel great!
And I have you to thank for it.
I have my moments, huh?
You're gonna have another one
this Friday at 4:00.
I made an appointment for us with Dr. Woo.
- My obstetrician.
- Yep.
- Oh.
- I'm finally gonna get a look at my little boy.
Hey. Pick whatever you want for dinner.
Just not Chinese again.
Who do you think you are?
Well, now you know how it felt for me
to have my Cheerios snatched away.
I can't do a song with three kids.
Not with that attitude.
Look, I'm prepared to cut you a deal.
You pass my Cheerios...
and I'll give you back
your team of losers and snot faucets.
Sue Sylvester...
you're gonna have to pry those F's
from my cold, dead hands.
Can't wait, pal!
My job is very stressful.
After dentists, obstetricians
have the highest rate of suicide...
among medical professionals.
Caring for my bonsai relaxes me.
- I had a huge crush on the Karate Kid
when I was a teenager.
- Can we cut the crap?
I guess I'm a little curious
as to what you ladies want from me.
- Neither of you are pregnant.
- Well, Woo...
you delivered all three of my kids.
Each one is dumber than the last.
Plus, they all have A.D.D.
And, although my husband nor I have red hair...
they are all creepy ginger kids.
- It's caused by a recessive gene.
- That's one theory. Do you wanna hear mine?
You gave me too much Pitocin
when I was in labor...
and it screwed up their DNA.
That's not a theory. You just made that up.
Mrs. Schuester, is your sister on some kind
of new psychotropic medication?
- Not that I know of.
- That's offensive.
- Are you all right?
- Shh. Here's the deal, Woo.
for some very powerful
mid size law firms in this town.
And I'm sure somebody would be more
than happy to take on my lawsuit.
- You'll never win.
- I don't have to win.
There's only two OBs in this town.
You get even the slightest stink on you...
and you can bet that a bunch
of your patients...
will just close on up their legs...
and walk on over to Dr. Chin.
Okay, this is outrageous.
What do you want?
Listen here, treasure trail.
We're about to have a smack-down.
I don't want to have a confrontation.
Don't play stupid with me, stubbles.
I'm having Finn's baby,
and you need to back off.
I'm asking you as nicely as I possibly can.
Leave him alone.
You're right. I-I've helped you not
because it's the right thing to do...
but because I had romantic ulterior motives.
But just so we're clear,
you're the one who's cheating.
- Excuse me?
- I have on good authority
that you're Sue Sylvester's mole...
and you can deny it all you want,
but I know it's true.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Sue is not on your side, Quinn.
She's not on anyone's side but her own.
Can you imagine what she's gonna do
when she finds out about your situation?
She'll probably try to rip off your uniform
with her bare hands.
All right.
Every time you whisper in her ear...
you empower her to do
more damage to the Glee Club.
And right now, Glee Club is all you have.
And if I were you,
I'd recognize who my true friends are.
And I'd practice a little bit more...
because you obviously have
a lot you need to express.
Oh, you have no idea.
¶¶ Set me free, why don't you, baby ¶¶
¶¶ Get out my life
why don't you, baby ¶¶
¶¶ 'Cause you don't really love me ¶¶
¶¶ You just keep me hangin' on ¶¶
- ¶¶ Ooh, ooh, ooh ¶¶
- ¶¶ You don't really need me ¶¶
¶¶ But you keep me hangin' on ¶¶
¶¶ Why do you keep comin' around ¶¶
¶¶ Playin' with my heart ¶¶
¶¶ Why don't you get out of my life ¶¶
¶¶ And let me make a new start ¶¶
¶¶ Let me get over you ¶¶
¶¶ The way you've gotten over me ¶¶
¶¶ Hey, set me free
why don't you, baby ¶¶
¶¶ 'Cause you don't really love me ¶¶
¶¶ You just keep me hangin' on ¶¶
- ¶¶ Ooh, ooh, ooh ¶¶
- ¶¶ No, you don't really want me ¶¶
¶¶ You just keep me hangin' on ¶¶
¶¶ You say although we broke up ¶¶
¶¶ You still want to be just friends ¶¶
¶¶ But how can we still be friends ¶¶
¶¶ When seein' you only
breaks my heart again ¶¶
¶¶ And there ain't nothin'
I can do about it ¶¶
- ¶¶ Whoa, whoa, whoa ¶¶
- ¶¶ Set me free, why don't you, baby ¶¶
- ¶¶ Whoa, whoa, whoa ¶¶
- ¶¶ Get out my life, why don't you, baby ¶¶
- ¶¶ Ooh, ooh, ooh ¶¶
- ¶¶ Go on, get out ¶¶
¶¶ And let me sleep at night ¶¶
¶¶ Please, 'cause you don't really love me ¶¶
¶¶ You just keep me hangin' on ¶¶¶¶
All right, everybody, take five.
We would just like to say
that although we find ourselves...
on opposite sides,
we hope you enjoy our number...
- and we look forward to seeing yours as well.
- Get on with it!
Enough with the jibber-jabber.
Sing something!
Sue, you can't talk to kids that way.
¶¶ Tell me how I'm supposed
to breathe with no air ¶¶
- ¶¶ Air, air ¶¶
- All right, that's it. Come on.
She had her chance.
Everybody up. We're leaving.
I'm sorry. Is there a fire?
No, and that's the point. There is no fire.
You know, it's sad enough
that my Sue's Kids are living in squalor...
- and probably on food stamps...
- My dad's a dentist.
But for you to drag 'em in here
and bore 'em to death? I won't stand for it.
Come on, kids. Out.
We're goin' for Coneys. My treat.
- All right, that's it!
- Really?
You know what, Sue? You've been pretty honest
about your feelings for me...
so let me return the favor.
You're rude, Sue. You have no class,
and you are a terrible teacher!
- I'll have you know I have my Ph.D.
- You got it online, Sue!
You are a failed performer, Will.
You weren't good enough
to make it in the real world.
You're not even good enough to run
this stupid little club that nobody cares about.
figuring out ways to terrify children
to try to make you...
that you're probably gonna spend
the rest of your life alone!
- How dare you talk to me like that!
- Don't you even...
Enough!
I'm sorry, Mr. Schue...
Miss Sylvester, but if we wanted
to hear Mom and Dad fight...
those of us who still have two parents
would just stay home on payday.
I agree. Glee Club is supposed to be fun.
And furthermore,
I don't like this minority business.
I may be a strong, proud black woman,
but I'm a lot more than that.
- I'm out.
- M-Me too.
Fellow Glee Clubbers, it would be an honor...
to show you how a real storm-out is done.
I encourage you to follow my lead.
Is that necessary?
It's nothing I haven't seen before.
I mean, I am the one who knocked her up.
Just standard operating procedure.
You okay, Mr. Schuester? You seem upset.
Just-Just a little stressed. Bad day at work.
Will, you're about to see your child
for the first time.
Can you forget about those
dancing delinquents for one minute?
You're right. I'm sorry.
Oh, my parents are gonna kill me
if I don't come home with a DVD.
Got it right here.
All right.
Juno.
Oh.
- You okay?
- Oh, that must be cold.
- Sorry about that.
- It's really... Yeah, it's a little cold.
Wow!
That's him!
Oh, hold on a sec.
What? I-Is something wrong with him?
Well, not exactly.
This is really embarrassing,
but it appears as if your boy is a girl.
Oh, my God. Did something happen to his...
No, he never had one. He's a she.
Must have misread the first sonogram.
Sorry about that.
Honey, I...
I didn't know that having a boy
was so important to you.
It isn't.
I don't care what she is.
She's all ours.
I'm just so happy.
No matter what happens...
I want you to remember at this moment...
that we love each other.
Okay?
Hey, Sue.
William. Close the door.
I, uh, wanted to talk to you
about the auditorium.
Good. I wanted to come to you, too,
but I have no idea where your office is.
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Sure.
So I decided to step down as co-head of Glee.
- Really?
- Yeah, it's not for me. It's too fruity.
I can't stand the sight of kids getting emotional
unless it's from physical exhaustion.
- Yeah. It did get pretty bad in there.
- Yeah.
I'd still like to stay on as consigliere.
You know, maybe you could show me
your set lists before competitions.
- Just so I feel like I'm contributing.
- Cool.
You know, I was a VJ for a couple of years.
Not MTV, but still.
Why do I feel like I'm about to fall
through a trapdoor into a pit of fire?
- Because you don't trust me.
- Mmm.
I know my methods are extreme,
and I know I'm not like the rest of you hippies...
caring about the kids' feelings
as if they're real.
And when I coach them, and they win, I win.
And you know how I feel about winning.
I do.
Look. Who's to say everything I do
is a hundred percent on the ball?
No one would say that.
Probably right, but, um, in hindsight...
you were right to shine the spotlight
on the fact that those kids are minorities.
You're in the Glee Club.
Now, there are only 12 of you.
And all you have is each other.
- or that Finn is...
- Unable to tell my rights from my lefts.
Or that Santana is Latina...
- or that Quinn is...
- Is pregnant.
Sorry, Q. It'll be all over
the blogosphere by this afternoon.
Now everybody knows... including me.
How could you do that?
Do you have any idea how much pain
you caused by running that story?
Sue made me do it.
This was a particularly interesting find...
from today's round of locker checks.
Are these your droopy,
white granny panties, Jacob?
Are you an Eve who was born a Steve?
Because if you are, I think there's a special
school that would better address your needs.
And I think that school is in Thailand.
Rachel gave them to me
so I wouldn't run the Quinn story.
What Quinn story?
Quinn Fabray is pregnant.
Not a chance.
If my head cheerleader was pregnant,
jeopardizing the very future of my Cheerios...
and thus my teaching tenure,
I think she would have come to me.
Quinn Fabray respects me
and would never lie to me. Never.
I have three sources confirming.
Please don't expel me.
I'll kill the story.
No. Run it.
I'm sorry, Rachel.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
