Once more... - Yes sir.
He's taking us to task for salute.
Don't know what's in store.
Who hoisted this flag?
- l did sir.
You've hoisted it 3 inches lower!
l couldn't see 3 inch difference
at the height of 30 feet.
Then, you wouldn't be able to see a
thief 30 feet away from you.
One week's suspension!
Oh God! Then l think
l'll be dismissed.
Do you know march past?
- They've forgotten all that.
Poor guys!
They've become like statutes
standing in one place for 20 years.
But l'm not like them sir
if you say l'll achieve it.
lf you say milk l'll become butter
if you say pulse l'll become sambar.
lf l say fire, will you
immolate yourself?
Will you kill if l
pay you money?
Will you throw out Kuppa  and
add `Kuppa' to Saamy's name.
First zip up your pant.
- Yes sir.
Look here! l'm telling
everyone.
Go and get drunk any where.
Wear shoes or not?
Cut hair or not?
Wear uniform or not?
Wear your cap or not?
l'm not bothered about all these.
You must follow the orders strictly,
if anyone bungles or refuses.
No warnings, suspensions or dismissals.
l'll kill you overnight and throw
your bodies into river Thamaraparani.
Mind it!
forget about them.
But an innocent should
never be punished.
A policeman must be proud.
lf anyone disturbs peace in public places.
Bash him up right there.
We must be a friend to people
and a rogue to rogues.
We policemen should salute
only our National flag.
lt's a town with a radius
of just 5 kms.
Though so many policemen are here, still
crimes are being committed regularly.
Who's responsible for it?
Mr.Paramasivam! - Yes sir.
Buses, lorries plying in Tirunelveli,
Wine shops, jewellery shops,
provision shops,
Lodges, hotels, colleges
businessmen, students,
Government servants, lawyers, doctors,
l want the entire list of people in
this town within 24 hours.
Why do you want doctors list?
l must know the number
of fake doctors.
Unwanted lorries shouldn't
enter the town.
Buses shouldn't stop at
unnecessary places.
No one should be in a petty shop
for more than 10 minutes.
A group of 4 people shouldn't
walk on the roads.
Most important, no one must tie their
lungies above their thighs.
lf they refuse,
kick their butts.
Sir, this is like MlSA rule.
What is my name?
Read it from the end `SA' `Ml'! MlSA.

Grandpa, did you call me?

What's the weight of this bag?
- 100 kgs.
You bought it after
weighing it, didn't you?
No, l must weigh it now.
- Weigh it & show me.
Hey! Put the bag on weighing scale.
lt's 94 kgs. only!
What happened to 6 kgs?
ls it for this bag only or
is it a feature to all your bags?
lf your proprietor comes to know,
you'll lose your job.
We get 40 paise per packet
as commission.
We are doing it to supplement
our meager earnings.
You are making us lose money.
- Forgive me sir.
l'll take leave mother
Hereafter this mistake
will not be repeated.
Your son is labour officer
for name's sake only.
lf he takes bribe from shop owners
he'll easily make money.
He's talking like a mad man
about honesty, sincerity.
That's why we are struggling
to meet both ends meet.
Grandpa, don't criticize dad.
Desiring other's money is a sin.
Money earned by hard work
only, will be with us.
Mother, l've taken
Rs.100 for bus pass.
Grandma, l'll go to college.
- Okay dear.
Sister, l'll go.
Meenakshi, your husband
is not to be seen all day?
Yes, is your son-in-law behaving
like a brahmin?
He went to conduct a sacrifice.
Don't know where he might be
picking up trouble now?
Stop, park your vehicle aside.
- Have you started it?
l'm on my way to conduct
a ceremony.
Let's take care of things
while coming back.
Forget it, park it aside and
take out your documents.
Documents mean?
- lnsurance.
For me, you or my bike?
- Of the bike?
Then, take it.
R.C.book! - Take R.C book.
Road tax! - There's no road but
you're asking for road tax.
What's this you're riding the bike without
changing the number plate?
Take it.
Why are you showing
like channel V?
You're changing rules at
the drop of a hat.
So, l've a white, black and
yellow number plate.
When you decide,
l'll fix that number plate.
You can fix it later, take out
your license. - License?
Take it...Check it.
You're without the tuft
in this photo.
That photo was taken
when l was a student.
So, l didn't have a tuft then.
lt is passport size photo,
infact l had gone there without pant.
Do you need all that?
How to make him pay fine?
Can you do an 8?
Not that, on your bike
can you do it?
Would they grant me a license
without doing that?
Then, make a 7 on your bike
- 7?
l think he's expecting some
bribe from me.
Come & sit on my bike
l'll do a 7.5.
How can you do that?
- Sit man, l'll show you.
l'm sitting. - Your bad time
starts now, pray to god.
Go slowly! - This is second installment
it has just started.
Are you killing me in installments!
- This is 3rd round.
Watch out, l'm doing a 7.5 on bike.
lsn't it fine? - Leave me, priest.
l'll show you how to repent.
Mr. Priest.
l asked your number plate and you
made me a nameless policeman.
That is real bad time.
Hey! Where's my left hand?
lt fell near Rettaipalam bridge.
Didn't you pick it up?
You're are referring to it as a cheap pencil?
- l'll get it for you.
Why does he never pray to
god at the temple?
Why are you looking at
me like this?
An astrologer told me to visit the temple
on Fridays or else l'll die.
Otherwise why would l come
to visit this man?
Saamy, l'll not spare you without
packing you to Singapore.
Book a ticket to God's idol from
Tuticorin port to Singapore.
As you say.
He's a millionaire!
But, his name is
Perumal Pitchai.
lt seems God had collected
food in alms.
And Hanuman snatched it from his
hands & enjoyed eating it.
But here, l'll snatch & l'll eat.
in this temple.
So, l had changed my name from
llaya Perumal to Perumal Pitchai .
Enough!
Greetings sir.
He's garlanding a rogue
instead of god.
Why did you garland me?
Are you changing party? - No Annachi.
A by-election is scheduled for
SriVaikuntam. Brother needs your support.
l've already made you two as MLA's.
Do you want one more?
There's only one bridge
in SriVaikuntam.
Only one bus can go on it, at a time.
Are you planning to bring it down?
- Nothing like that sir.
Okay, you want to contest
the election.
Subramani, are you doing well?
- l'm fine.
He stole a woman's jewels when she
bent to give him alms.
Today, he's a big shot.
l know him very well.
Even if l give him Rs. 10 lakhs.
He'll make a golden begging bowl
and beg in Singapore.
Sir, we've got information that
Coimbatore MP is going to Guruvayoor.
A man who was hiding without
even going to Parliament.
lf he's daring to come out, it means...
Kill him! - Annachi, situation
is very bad.
Are we killing for money, to be returned,
if we fail in our mission.
Political murders must be committed
at regular intervals.
lll fated guy! Bloody man is
going to a temple to die.
Sir, you'll never get married?
- Why?
You're searching
so many houses to live.
How many girls would
you see to marry one?
Don't worry if we
fail to get one.
We've police quarters
as the last resort.
This's the house mentioned
by the shop keeper.
Whom do you want?
We've come to see a house for rent.
- Who are you?
l'm an lnspector and he's
Deputy Commissioner.
Just wait there.
Grandma, last week two people stole in the
disguise of policemen, they're here.
Yes, did you close
the door properly?
Grandma, we must plan
and catch them.
Why do you want to take
unnecessary risk?
Aunt, be ready with
chili powder.
You all come immediately,
when l call you, come grandma.
We'll come late at nights,
there's only one way here.
What can we do if they lock it?
- We must break the lock.
Don't we know it?
- Didn't l tell you?
Come...come...please.
This is the hall,
a very large one.
You can place the sofa,
Sit or do anything.
Why is she speaking
like a loose ?
Yes, loose...the door latch
is little loose.
lt'll be okay if we tighten it.
Grandma is old, but really bold.
- They say old is gold.
They said upstairs is vacant.
But, you're showing the downstairs.
Our first floor and ground
floors are alike. - Yes.
lf you see one you
needn't see another.
This is middle of the house,

You can stock groceries.
This is prayer room

You can cook, fry, eat or do anything.

Go inside!
- Hey why are you pushing us inside?
Aunt...Aunt! All of you come here.
We've caught the thieves.
Thieves! Tell them, who are we?
How many people we would've arrested?
Today 2 mad women
have arrested us.
Wait, did you call the police? - Yes.
Aunt, we are real police.
Last week 2 guys
said the same thing.
Aunt, please listen to me.
What happened?
Sir, they threw chili
powder on my face.
Why are you laughing sir?
What happened madam?
Open the door carefully, 2 strong
bull like men are there. - Yes.
Aim your rifles at them.

Sir, what's this?
- Did you call him a thief?
He's our Deputy Commissioner.
Deputy Commissioner?
A mistake has been
committed unknowingly.
Please forgive us...
Last week, a similar incident
happened in the next street.
That's why my grand daughter
mistook you.
Sorry! - Forgive us.
That is the way out.
Give me some ''idlies''...
l'll have them with this side dish.
Greetings sir...
Greetings sir...
lf we leave it as it is, it'll
become a problem. - Okay...okay..
New Deputy Commissioner
has come to see you.
Welcome, Deputy Commissioner...
Name...Arusaamy!
Place...Palani.
Till now, you've been transferred to
You never stayed at any place
for a long time...
You're such an honest man.
My boys told me this place has changed
a little after your arrival.
What are you looking at man?
l'm here ...
But l'm aware of all that's happening
in every nook & corner of lndia.
But nobody knows about me...
- l know...
Your original name is llaya Perumal,
Out of 123 wine shops in Tirunelveli,
You own 1 16 shops including
Out of 80 lorries quarrying
sand from river Tamarabarani,
You own 75 lorries.
are without permits.
You own many lodges
under fictitious names.
They're being used for
illegal activities.
You've 3 ships in Tuticorin & 2 cracker
factories in Sivakasi. Apart from these,
Which ever party may come to power...
ln the 8 districts of south,
You select the winning &
losing MLA's & MP's.
Perumal Pitchai, kingmaker.
But your name will never be published
in the newspaper...
Your posters will never be seen.
After knowing all this, you won't
leave me without taking action.
But, if you take action
l won't spare you.
You won't take bribe also.
Which place you want to
be transferred? Tell me.
l'll help you...
- Who said that l won't take bribes?
My henchmen.
Hey! Give him a chair.
Go & bring it.
How much can you offer?
How much you want?
l want to do my duty.
l need your help for that.
l didn't get you.
ln city, your lorries
always cross speed limit,
and are frequently involved
in accidents.
They should be
within city speed limits.
Despite knowing, drinking liquor is
injurious to health, they drink.
l'm not bothered about them.
But if a drunkard creates a scene
on the road, l'll not spare him.
Your henchmen shouldn't come to me
for taking them out on bail.
l'm not bothered about your
illegal businesses.
But you should control local goons
who use your name.
Or else, l may have to control them
and you shouldn't get angry with me.
l don't care about your
illegal wine shops.
But, you've 7 shops near schools & temples
which are troublesome to people.
l'm not asking you to
close down those shops.
You can shift them to
some other place.
lf you agree to this,
l'll accept your money.
l think what you said is right.
Okay, l'll make arrangements.
Hey! Give him...take it...
l'll take leave...
Brother...
You said you're from Palani...
What is the caste you said...
l didn't say.
Sir, what's this?
Why did you act like a`Yes man'?
He seems to be from our caste.
- What do you mean?
Did you hear his brave words?
So, do we've to obey
all his commands?
He was not ordering us.
He told us politely.
His predecessors went against us.
Or else, they took bribe and
ruined the town.
He's different to them.
Not only that we are also facing
problems in those 7 shops.
let's shift them & see.
What's this? Why do you create so much
smoke like a dream sequence?
Shut up. Can't you
cut your hair?
Shut up! This's going to be
a fashion in 2005.
Watch out! Even Capt. Vijaykanth
will sport this hair style.
Not only that, for all priests,
it's traditional to sport
such a hair style...
Are you atleast doing that properly?
Wherever you go, you create trouble.
- What to do?
Last week, the marriage which
l had attended as a priest,
at the time of giving
the auspicious thread,
l saw the groom's face
and got shocked...
l had performed that rascal's
marriage a month earlier.
l was tensed.
l took a brick from
sacrificial fire,
asked him, ''How many girl's lives
are you going to ruin'',
l threw it on his face.
That's all.
He started to bleed profusely.
Then, it stopped.
Did the bleeding stop?
No...marriage was stopped.
lt's enough if you perform your job
properly without creating problem today.
You knot the hair soon...
l'll conduct it excellently...
l've already done it.
Rogues are not traveling on the
foot-board these days.
After the arrival of D.C. Arusaamy...
lf they do, they're beaten black & blue.
Oh God! l've lost my chain...
Driver, go to the police station...
Check every one.
Don't spare anyone.
Brahmin girl!
Stand in a line.
Can't you recognize a thief by face?
Do we look like thieves?
Didn't you throw
chili powder on our faces?
Hey! What's happening there?
- Sir, chain snatching...
They are making even girls
to stand in a line.
Why is he staring at us?
Show me your bag.
- We are getting late to college.
First check us...
Paramasivam, send them first.
Women police are coming
to check women.
When will they come
and when will we go?
lt's alright, send them.
Sir, l'll not allow anyone
to disturb me in my duty.
Because, l'm not a police man
but a rogue.
You can go...
- What about the bus?
Bus will go after checking every one.
Then, how will we go?
- Go by an auto.
Money?
Don't you carry Rs.20, while going
to the college? - Rs.20!
We've a student bus pass.
lf by chance we lose it,
we've Rs.5 for to & fro fare.
We've curd rice & pickle for lunch.
Apart from this, why should a
college girl carry money?
Okay, l'll give you money.
Hey! Call an auto.
- We don't want other's money.
Okay, take it as loan
& repay it later.
His mind is getting distracted.
Sir, my wife isn't happy
about my late coming.
Atleast today let's go early.
Wait, let the night show be over.
He'll neither marry & enjoy
nor allow me to enjoy.
Why are you blabbering?
l was talking about the
greatness of bachelor's life.
Who's that?
Where are you coming from?
Sir, we went to a movie.
- Movie?
Didn't your husbands come with you?
No Sir.
Where is your house? - Vagedu.
Vagedu?...Are you going there
alone at this late hour?
Take this torch.
- No, it's alright.
lt's alright, take it.
Ask your husband to return it
in the station tomorrow.
Take it. - Okay sir, bye.
Sir take it. You've helped my wife.
Thank you very much.
Wife? Hey! Are you a man?
Neither you were courageous to take
your wife to the night show,
Nor you had the guts to
stop her from going alone.
Then, why did you marry?
After not stopping her from
going alone,
You complain that she has been
robbed, raped, murdered etc..
Hey! There are 550 million women
in our country.
ls it possible to provide police
security to every woman?
Paramasivam, hereafter you arrest
all the husbands,
Who send their wives alone to
movies. - Yes sir.
lf he had married, he would've known
the problem of a husband. - What?
Sir, nothing. l just tested whether
this torch is working or not.
A white cat is living
in my house.
What's this Hubby?
Who are they?
They're very tired children.
Serve them food.
Oh God! lt's a great sin.
- Sin?
Why grandpa is shouting like this?
- Did he get a stroke?
Don't blabber. They're offering
food to the crows.
You'll offer food to the crows.
Won't you offer it to them?
Crows are our forefathers,
our ancestors.
Ancestors? ls an ordinary crow
your grandfather?
ls Raven, your great grand father?
Whom are you fooling?
Hey! Don't criticize the traditions,
you fool. - Forgive me grandpa.
Crows may satiate their hunger
by picking or stealing food.
Blue cross also protects them.
But for the poor & uneducated
like them,
White cross like us are
here to help.
Grandpa, do you know, because
of the food you offer to crows,
How many problems politicians
have to face?
What do you mean?
lt eats gravy food here,
And a rotten `Masal vada'
from a shop,
Mutton piece
from a mutton shop.
Eating all this, its stomach
gets upset.
Lastly they go & sit over
the Politician's head,
And shit like this.
Don't you've Rs.50? What's this man?
...Go, man...
Sir, l asked for his license
and he said `No'.
That's why, l warned him.
l believe...l believe you...
Why do you ask Rs.50 and
insult the police?
You ask Rs.500. To escape from the
trouble, he'll take a license,
And you can also avoid
asking bribes frequently.
ls he asking me take bribe or not?
l don't get him.
Why are you dull for the
past 2 days?
Hey! DC is there, l'll return
the auto fare.
Bus may start...
- l'll come back before that.
When will it be finished?
- The judgement is on 10th of next month.
You said, it's one day's work.
Remind me about it. - Yes sir.
Hello, What's it?
That day you gave me Rs.22.50
as auto fare, take it...
lt was Rs.45, why're you giving me
only Rs.22.50? - Rs.45?
Metre showed only Rs.22.50...
- He asked me for the return fare of Rs.22.50.
Oh God!
To repay Rs.22.50, l was
sleepless for 2 days.
l packed chili powder
in 60 packets.
Oh God! l missed the bus.
How will l go now? - You go by an auto.
What about the auto fare?
- How many of you've started this business?
You may not have much money,
but only Rs.5 for bus fare.
For lunch, you would've curd rice
& pickle.
No, today l've sambar rice & `pulse'
curry. - Let it be anything.
You'll say that why does a college girl
need money more than this?
Take it back. Keep your cash bag
with yourself.
Hey! Auto...
Your money... - Repay the total
money later.
Hey! Wait.
What's your name? - Sir, Murugan.
Which area? - Pettai.
You know the station phone number?
- Yes sir.
lnform me on phone after dropping her.
- Okay sir. - Go.
Dhanam brother. - Yes sir.
You follow that auto.
Why did he ask you to
phone him?
l look like a rowdy, don't l?
That's why, he suspects me.
ls DCP your relative? He's very concerned
about you! - Nothing like that.
Then, why is he sending a
constable to follow us?
After Saamy sir's arrival, Tirunelveli
junction is entirely changed.
All those vandals on roads have
gone into hibernation.
Wow, whether the auto runs or not,
metre runs perfectly...
He's an honest man...
Do you know how much
he's concerned about me?
Don't move around with a policeman. Forget it,
or else l'll inform aunt.
You tell aunt or Saamy .
- Again Saamy!
He's a good person...
He's an honest man.
Bhuvana, do you know who's the guest
for tomorrow's function?
Deputy Commissioner Saamy!
What's it Annachi?
You've made me jobless.
Earlier atleast once in a month
we used to hear the blasts.
Now, there's no sound and l feel as
if l've become deaf.
Don't you know anything else
other than planting bombs?
l've made you the proprietor of a
You're standing here like a lamp post
leaving behind your brain in Sivakasi.
A dog will always remain loyal
to lick it's boss's feet.
lf we allow him, he may plant
a bomb here itself.
First send him to Sivakasi.
Brother, come let's go
to bus station.
l'll call you when l need you.
Greetings, sir... - Greeting sir...
Annachi...
He is taking bath.
Generally people can hold breath
for 2 minutes under water.
But Annachi can hold for 10 minutes.
Welcome Saamy.
What are you looking at?
Surprised as to how l know about
your arrival?
Even from under 10 feet water,
l can recognize anyone.
l'm used to take bath here
since my childhood.
Neither l know it's virtues
nor sins..
l made him a MLA.
But, he made tall promises that
he'll give this & that,
Sanction water supply etc.,
on the stage.
Believing him, farmers are
waiting with their implements.
Even CM used to ask me before
saying anything on the stage.
He went over board.
Tirunelveli is receiving Tamarabarani
water after l take my bath in it.
Saamy, don't mistake me.
l'm a friendly type but if l
get angry, l'll not spare anybody.
All having Tata Sumos,
Qualis etc.,
Are you wondering why l'm
still using Ambassador?
Astrologer told me that if l lose
this car my life will be in danger.
Nagarajan of 75th ward is
troubling us using your name.
Hey! Who's that rascal? Playing politics
without our knowledge!
Ask him to meet me...
l'll take care of him, you go.
- l'll get along.
He's the right man. He consults me
& does everything...
District Magistrate who's the Chief Guest
here on this lndependence day..
After you've come to Tirunelveli
crime rate has come down a lot.
Whatever help you want, tell me...
As a Judge, l'll definitely do the
needful. - Thank you sir.
l'll request the Deputy Commissioner
Arusaamy to give a speech.
l like Tirunelveli ''Halwa''.
Becareful, he might cheat you.
l like girls in this town
more than that.
Don't mistake me.
l like your courage...
ln this town, the way the
girls carry umbrellas,
l feel as if they're
carrying sickles.
Normally, men will trouble women.
He may be a thief or a rogue.
You shouldn't get scared of them.
l'm not asking you to carry
weapons for self protection.
Even chili powder in
your house will do.
l've the experience of being attacked
by the chili powder.
Hey! He's referring to you.
ln this town, when we went in search
of a house in civil dress, a girl...
A girl mistook us as thieves
and locked us inside a room.
She threw chili powder on us.
She's a student of
your college.
Who's she?
The girl wearing black
upper cloth...that girl.
lt's you only.
lt'll be better if you come on
the dais yourself.
He's calling you.
Go...go.
Bhuvana, please come to the stage.
On behalf of our Police Department,
l appreciate her.
l like her bravery.
l like her intelligence.
l like it...l like it very much.
Oh God! You like me.
l too like you.
l like your courage &
your liking me.
l like you innocence.
l like the eyes which
stole me.
l'm new to this trade
of stealing.
l'm not able to steal
it fully & cleanly.
l like your lips which are like
the couplet of Thiruvalluvar.
l like the act played by
your lips near my ears.
l like the folds on your
waist which hold the sari.
l like to live in there.
l like the sleep, because you
come in my dream.
lf Buddha falls in love,
He'll tie a swing under the
''Bodhi'' tree for the child.
lf Kattambomman falls in love, he'll
pluck flowers in a battle field.
You made me study love lessons before
my morning & evening studies
l've turned a policeman
into a thief now.
Bhuvana, why are you coming
with a garland?
Saamy gave me the garland.
- What?
l mean a garland which was
offered to Saamy
Oh, God's garland!
Then, keep it safely inside.
- Okay, Grandma.
Hail Motherland!
Hail Motherland!
Children, why are you all standing
there? Come & join us.
Hey, they're from a different caste.
l want them also to join us.
- They are from other caste.
Colour difference must be
in the flag only.
Not in the hearts of people.
They belong to low caste, man.
You are calling them as others.
Who are they?
They laid these roads.
They built your houses.
They are the people who vote in
elections. They wash your clothes.
They hold breath and clean sewages,
diving into them.
Rice, Wheat & Flour,
They are the people
who produce them.
lf they are not here,
how'll we get food?
What's this, sir?
We were eagerly waiting for
chocolates. You spoiled that too.
Silly boy! l was arguing
for you only.
Today, it's our lndependence Day!
On this day, you must know about
a great freedom fighter.
Look at this.
Did you see? Do you know him?
l know him. Police is searching
him, isn't it?
What are you saying boy?
He's the kidnapper who abducted
Rajkumar & Nagappa, isn't he?
Just for the moustache, you've made
Poet Bharati into brigand Veerappan.
Bharati, are you closing your ears
with head gear not to hear this?
Greetings leader!
lt seems you've started a new party.
Admit me into your party.
Hey, when did l start a party?
You've hoisted a colourful flag.
You've gathered a crowd around you.
Can't you differentiate between National
flag & a Party flag, when you're drunk?
l'm your party's Propaganda Secretary.
That is P.S.!
You're not P.S. For me, you're
the murderer Godse.
They are from a very
poor family.
You must find the stolen jewellery
& return it to them.
You're saying 30 sovereigns
of gold and 40,000 cash.
Will you keep them in this ramshackle
bureau instead of bank?
You seem to be senseless people.
- Please, find it somehow.
You're asking us to find them,
as if we know where they're.
Can we visualize with
extra sensory perception?
Hey, tell me man!
Tell me your name.
Narayanan!
When did it happen?
l don't know!
Did you go to the temple with the
entire family leaving them at home?
Yes, Saamy!
- l'm Bhuvana speaking.
Which Bhuvana?
You know me and l know you.
Oh! Chili powder!
What's the matter?
Modus-operandi! - He had bent
window bars.
To open the bureau he had
used a crow bar.
We've informed finger print experts.
Police sniffer dogs are on the way.
Hello!
Paramasivam, get me the list of
thieves who use crow bars.
One minute sir.
Tell me!
Setta Muthu, Melapalayam Anwar,
Market Radha, Palayamkottai David...
Atthupalayam Buddhar and
Vallanadu Mottai, sir.
Trace out all of them and inform me.
- Okay sir.
Sir, they're my 35 years savings.
lt's your hard earned money,
you'll get them.
Sir, 5 are available.
Vallanadu Mottai is missing.
Find him!
l had saved the jewels
for her marriage.
lf we don't get them back,
Our entire family must
commit suicide.
Why are you crying?
Be brave.
Sir, Vallanadu Mottai has stolen them.
What are you saying, man?
He has informed B-2 Police lnspector
on phone about the theft.
lt's shameful!
Where's the accused now?
We've arrested him at
Kaitharu check post.
First bring those jewels
and cash immediately,
Or else a family will
commit suicide.
Make the date as 12.
Yes, Paramasivan. - Take it!
These are your jewels, aren't they?
Check them.
Sir! - What's this sir?
You're like my father, why are
you falling at my feet?
You're like God to
our family.
You take their statement. - Yes sir.
- You've saved our lives.
We'll be indebted to you all our lives.
- l'll get along.
You caught the thief by
investigating brilliantly.
l'm proud of you.
Reduce your girths,
Or else you won't be able to
see your own shoes also.
Didn't you get any
pirated VCD's?
You all are going to theatre,
aren't you?
Venkatrama, an injustice is going on
in this neighbourhood.
What's going on?
lt seems a policeman comes here
and finds a thief in one hour.
Are they stealing themselves
and returning,
Or is it a nexus between police
and thieves? l've a doubt.
lf they find, you'll accuse
them of a nexus.
lf they fail you'll accuse
them of incompetence.
People like you must be punched.
You might defend
them vociferously.
But when a sniffer dog takes
a day to find a thief,
How can he find in one hour?
lf Police decides, not in
one hour,
They can arrest you this very
minute under POTA...
How's it possible? - They can arrest
if you possess any weapon.
l don't have any weapon
in my possession.
Here, you've one.
He's having a weapon. Arrest him.
- Are you talking Law? Come man.
Here they are arresting on receiving
just one complaint.
There, a brigand is releasing
audio cassettes in the forest,
Arranging a press meet.
When are you going to
arrest him?
Brother, Police have been informed.
Saamy is coming here.
Who's this Saamy?
lf 10 people join and
do it, it's a criminal act.
lf 100 people join & do it,
it's a violent communal clash.
What's going to happen now
is the communal clash.
Disperse peacefully from here
without disturbing people.
A man from our caste has been killed.
We'll not stop.
lnvestigation is progressing.
lt's unlawful to gather a crowd
without permission.
We've been born & brought up here,
whose permission do we've to take?
l'm warning you for the last time,
disperse immediately.
lf we don't, will you
baton charge us?
Will you stop us with brick bats,
Or disperse us using
tear gas shells?
Whatever it is, we are not
going to disperse.
Look, he's running away.
Saamy, are you a Policeman
or a rowdy?
l'm not a fool to get hacked by you
with a baton & brickbat.
l'm not an idiot policeman to wait for
Collector's order to fire below knees.
l'm Saamy.
Are you using bad words publicly?
- What will you do?
lf you kill us,
l'll also kill you.
Will you burn down a bus?
l'll burn you down!
lf you kill us, it's a murder.
lf l kill you,
it's an enquiry commission.
l know how to face that
enquiry commission.
lf you like to fight, go to Vallanadu
mountains, fight & die there.
Why are you entering the town and
disturbing the peace?
Saamy, do you know against
whom you're going?
You're going against a
powerful caste.
You'll find all these
names in thousands.
One in 100 millions will be named as
Arusaamy. l'm one in 100 million.
lf you go against me, l'll exterminate
your entire group.
Be careful!
l'm not a Policeman but
a rogue.
Sir, you said something,
what does it mean?
Rotten egg and foolish monkey!
- Oh, doesn't it have a bad meaning?
Hold it tightly, don't loosen
the bedspread.
Bloody idiots!
Who used so much herbal medicine
for inhaling vapours,
As if it's to be given to a cattle?
- l used for immediate...
My life? - No, cold!
That's alright!
l'll add poison to the food you eat.
You'll reach heaven.
Annachi, today he had threatened
that caste.
ln future, he might go
against us also.
Hey, why are you getting
such crazy ideas?
Saamy is our man.
He'll never go against us.
You go...
Sir, let's shift the Police station
to the bus stand. - Why?
We are always here.
- lt's peak hour!
Peak hour or girl hour! - Hey!
ln the morning, you're standing there
& in the evening you're here.
lt's sunny there in the morning
& sunny here in the evening.
Are you standing here for the Sun
or the girl?
Saamy is standing there.
Are you disappointed that he hasn't
turned to see you?
Shall l call him? ... Saamy!
- Hey, keep quiet!
Hello!
Bundle him into the jeep.
He's itching for trouble.
Take him away, bloody rogue.
lf l'm a little careless,
l think he'll kill me also.
l've curd rice & pickle
for lunch.
Why does a college going girl
need money for other than this.
Madam, DC told me to
give this to you.
Silence, what's this trouble
in front of a temple?
We've bought a new elephant
for our neighbourhood temple.
Did you buy it? Very good.
Are you going to make it
beg in the shops around here?
That isn't the problem.
- What's the problem?
There's a temple inside dedicated to
Lord Vishnu & Lord Shiva separately.
lt's a known fact!
Do we've to mark the elephant
with Lord Vishnu's symbol,
r the sacred ash symbol of Lord Shiva, that's the probler
Oh, have you started that problem?
Does the elephant know
about this problem?
How can it know, it's an animal?
- ls it the only animal here?
Silence! You're arguing about
Lord Vishnu's & Lord Shiva's symbols.
Did anyone of you think of
making it wear a shirt?
You've seen film
''Kalikambal'', haven't you?
ln that film, the elephant
wears a shirt.
First tell us, whose side are you,
their's or our's?
Aunt, Lord Vishnu & Shiva
are one & the same.
Those who're ignorant of this are
useless. l believe in this thought.
So, l'm sporting a ''Rudraksh'' here &
Lord Vishnu's symbol on my forehead.
Both are same to me.
l don't know whether you'll mark it
with Lord Vishnu's or Shiva's symbol.
lt's going to drop dung now.
First decide who's going to clean it.
You... you...
He's right hand and
left hand of my Annachi.
As the girl was chubby & beautiful,
he molested her.
Will you do it, if your
sisters are like that?
Take him away!
Don't stare at me after
committing the mistake.
Shall l go, Saamy?
Hey, Manickam, MLA is
taking him away!
Hey, look there.
Sir, we thought you were a good
and honest policeman.
You've released him.
Be patient.
How can l be patient?
He has molested my sister.
Can we do anything if we've money?
Have you finished?
Okay l'll arrest him now.
They'll transfer me from here,
l'm not bothered about it.
Another Officer will come.
He'll release him and arrest
you under Goondas Act.
He'll foist a theft case
on your father.
He'll brand your sister as prostitute
and ruin your entire family.
So, do we've to endure all this?
- You've to.
You're waiting patiently in a queue
for kerosene in a ration shop,
And for tickets in a theatre.
How can you get instant justice?
lf the case goes to Court,
They'll put embarrassing questions
and kill that girl alive.
A secret between us will
become an open secret.
Then, isn't there any way
to get justice?
Putting such rogues in jail isn't
just punishment for them.
Against Law, we must stone him to death
or shoot him to death publicly.
Such a situation will come,
then l'll give you a sickle.
Till then, retain this anger on him.
- Sir, Annachi has called you.
Tell him, l'll come. - He has asked you
to come immediately, sir.
Rascal!
Bloody!
What do you think of me?
Am l your servant or
your broom?
He's calling me authoritatively
as if l'm his watchman.
l've self esteem & self respect. l'll not
give them up under any circumstances.
The money you pay me is fee
for the mistakes you commit.
lt's a price for not
doing my duty.
l'll respect only Perumal Pitchai.
l don't care for any other beggar
who begs from him.
lf you still do it, l'll pump bullets
into everyone of you here.
King will kill on the same day.
God will kill leisurely,
And l'll kill without leaving
any evidence. Be careful.
Annachi, he's abusing us loudly and
you're watching.
He's definitely from our caste only.
When he was speaking in anger,
his ears turned red. Did you see?
He meant all of us and
you're talking about his caste.
l had told you to call him.
Did you cross the limits and
invited trouble here?
A Tiger will crouch to pounce
on the prey. Be careful.
Hey, stop the jeep.
Why is she standing here without
going to college?
Sir, where're you now?
l'm on my way to
Commissioner's office.
lsn't that chili powder
girl there..
Yes, so what?
She's standing at the bus stop for a
long time. Did you ask her to come?
Okay...l'm coming there immediately.
Then, Commissioner?
l'll meet him later.
That's it.
When it comes to love
even God will falter.
Can Saamy stay away from faltering?
Start the jeep.
Why're you standing here?
l want to talk to you...
About what?
Why didn't you come for
the last 4 days?
l went to Madurai for
CM's programme, why?
What happened?
Why're you crying?
l feel lost without seeing you.
l feel like seeing
you every day.
l want to be always with you.
Okay, hereafter, you'll always
be with me only.
How?
lf l marry you, won't you be always
with me?
Will you marry me?
Yes.
Really?
l'll definitely marry you.
Shall we marry and then elope
or shall we elope & then marry?
Shall we marry and then
have children,
Or shall we have children
and then marry?
You're a girl grown
in fragrance...
You're a fair complexioned
grown up girl.
There's no date that'll
suit Saamy.
lt's not justice to quote
silly reasons.
You speak & look tasteful.
Can you cook tastefully?
Shall l boil red gram in milk,
make it a paste & serve you?
Did l ask you for a patient's diet?
l had asked, can you cook spicy food?
l can prepare pepper soup
with red chili, taste it.
Can you prepare crab, chicken
and mutton soup?
There's spice in my waist.
Come and relish it as you wish.
You're threatening me with your
big moustache like ''Ayyanar''.
Why're you hesitating like a hen
to jump over the fence to hatch eggs?
Only after our marriage is fixed,
l'll jump the fence.
Do as you wish.
l'll present you with a gift if you
adjust a little before marriage.
lf l take a turmeric bath,
desires overtake me.
lf l see you, my body
is getting thrilled.
Shall l come to gossip with you
or stay with you all night?
Sir, my son was driving the car.
The cyclist crossed his path
and fell under his car.
You must help us.
Give Rs.4 lakhs.
Why're you forcing me
to marry now?
lf you feel l'm a
burden to you,
l'll drown myself to death
in the river. - Shut up.
Which river has water
for you to drown?
Only lorries transporting sand
are plying on river beds.
Why're you biting nails now?
l feel like biting you
just like this.
l'm not able to understand your sister,
do you also want to join?
lf you like, marry or else
l'll send them back.
No need, they've liked
you very much.
lf father agrees, we can fix
the date of marriage.
Hello. - Tell me, chili powder.
A prospective groom has
come to see me.
From which place? - Papanasam.
Good place. There's a dam there.
You can take good bath.
Did you like the groom?
l'm serious, are you
making fun of me?
They're going to fix
the date shortly.
Tell me if they fix it.
l'll create trouble immediately.
How can you come immediately?
l'm outside your house.
Shall l come in and
create trouble?
l'm not scared any more
about anything.
l became more confident
after seeing you.
l'm not interested in
this marriage.
Look, we are in no way inferior
to you in anything.
My son is working in
R.T.O. Office.
He's earning Rs.6,500
every month.
Why're you refusing this proposal?
- He's right, isn't he?
He's signing for Rs.6,500 and
taking Rs.10,000 as bribe.
What're you saying?
l'm not interested in a
boy who takes bribes.
Excuse me. l've come to know from uncle
that the groom takes bribes.
This is an honest and straight
forward family.
You leave the place, it'll not suit you.
- ls this the respectful way?
Then, l'll do one thing.
l'll pack some crisps and
chutney for you. Go away.
Hey Tuft!
Are you calling me tuft?
lf l tie this tuft,
it's personality.
lf l untie, it's university.
lf l show my character,
it's municipality.
Shall l tie, untie or show you?
Tell me. - Son-in-law.
You can leave...go...go.
What happened? - My father has
refused the proposal.
Saved me from creating trouble,
okay, l'll go now.
Why did he refuse the proposal?
lt seems the bridegroom
takes bribes.
My father has come to know about it.
So, he rejected him.
What was that noise?
Nothing.
Police quarters.
Sister!
Hey chili powder?
How come you're here?
Give me his house keys.
Why're you asking DC's
house keys?
He's always eating in Hotels.
So, l've come to cook for him.
l've asked him to come
home for lunch.
Oh!
ls it dress rehearsal before marriage?
Restrict it to cooking only.
What is his favourite food?
Except a flying plane & a floating ship,
he'll eat everything.
Sir, they're adulterating petrol
in the gas station.
Adulteration is in everything.
Go & complain to the Consumer court.
Sir, they've attacked a woman.
- What're you saying?
Look there, sir.
- What happened?
When l complained about the shortage
of petrol he supplied.
They kicked my scooter
and pushed me down.
What're you looking at?
First take her to a hospital. Go...go.
l don't want all that.
l'll not budge till l find a way out
for this problem. - What's this?
How much sir! - One litre.
We'll not supply in bottles.
Come on.
ls it one litre?
Sir, why did you beat him?
Who beat that woman?
Tell me...tell me.
Why're you beating him, sir?
How dare you beat a woman?
Sir, why're you beating us?
- Tell me, who beat that woman?
You don't have any right to ask us.
This is Annachi's petrol station. - Go away.
Are you giving 3/4 litre
for one litre?
There's another department
to enquire all this.
Anyone can enquire about
your short supply.
Any department can ask you.
Sir, this man had kicked me.
Sir, don't beat me.
- Where're you running away?
Do you think there's no one
to question you?
Get everyone into the jeep.
Close the petrol station
and seal it.
Annachi, DC has sealed
our petrol station.
Greetings sir.
- Where's your D.C.?
He has gone home for lunch.
Brother Paramasivan saide that you like
non-vegetarian food very much.
l don't know to cook
non-vegetarian. Sorry.
But, l'll learn to cook
non-vegetarian after marriage.
Hey Chili Powder!
Ever since l fell in love with you,
l've reduced taking non-vegetarian.
l'll stop it completely after marriage.
Great! Fantastic!
Do you know what my friends say?
l'm very lucky. - Why?
lt seems you're
straight forward.
And earned a good name
from all quaters. - ls it?
There's only one thing which
l don't like in you.
That one gray hair
in your moustache.
Shall l remove it?
- No...my lucky hair.
l'll remove it one day.
- Let me see.
You please sit down. - Okay.
l say, wait.
Who's that?
Are you married?
Who's this girl?
Are you having intimate relations with girls?
Do whatever you feel like doing?
Why're you troubling me?
Are you sealing my
petrol station?
ls it the way to show your loyalty
towards the millions l paid you?
Even the food that's sticking
in your hand.
Was bought by the money
l gave you as alms.
lf l don't like anyone l'll kill
him even if he's my sibling.
By staying with me, are you trying
to go against me?
l'm a man who will burn an
entire place to kill one man.
lf you go against me next time.
No one can find even the place
where you were killed.
Or find any clue
about your grave.
l'll shred you into pieces.
We'll go...go.
Please listen to me.
Wait...do you know what they had done?
Without knowing the truth...
l thought you were a good man.
- Please listen to me.
Leave me.
Don't go away in haste.
Annachi, petrol bunk is opened.
Hey, is it a finance company
to open & close frequently?
The insult which
we've faced, is history.
The day he entered our house
we should've taught him a lesson.
What do you want me to do?
Tell me, Annachi....
As a woman got hurt,
he got angry.
We asked many times...
but, he didn't reply.even once...
Hey, forget about it.
Hey, this news shouldn't be
published in evening's newspaper.
Bhuvana.... - Don't touch me.
Listen to me...
- What's left to say?
What happened was....
- lt's enough.
The faith which l had on you is lost.
God won't forgive you
for deceiving a girl.
Bhuvana, don't talk like a fool.
l'm a fool to have believed a cheat
who cheats the town.
Today, you used your position
and took money.
Tomorrow, what's the guarantee that
you won't sell me? - Hey, stop it...
l can just leave you & go away.
But, you'll commit suicide
within a week.
l can't bear that....
Do you know why l took bribe?
Every police man's job
has become commercial.
But, l consider this uniform
as my honour.
My father considered his
job as sacred.
Whichever caste or religion a person
may belong to, if mistake is committed,
Only police has the right to get it rectified.
That's why, l educated my son &
asked him to take up police job.
Then, will Saamy become
lnspector in our place?
Why're you asking like
a competitor?
lf my son gets a job....He'll become
an officer, in this place.
Saamy, you've got an interview card.
Oh Margosa tree, Tamarind tree
Banyan tree, Holy Fig tree,
l'm going to leave the village.
Oh Sengamalam! Who comes &
takes bath in the river.
l'm going to leave the village.
l'm going to a far away place
where factory siren can't be heard.
l'm going to a far away place
which the sparrow hasn't seen.
l'm going to leave the village
wearing police uniform.
He's going to leave the village
wearing police uniform.
After waking up in the morning...
l'll play brandish sticks.
lf l get hurt by playing
brandish sticks,
l'll apply the soil of my mother land on it.
My desire is fulfilled.
My father's heart is
filled with joy.
l'm going to ride a bike
happily at a high speed.
When Aruasaamy will come in a procession
landlord will give respect to him.
When Saamy sees the young girls
he'll fold his hands.
Oh Dear....Oh dear...
Oh dear...Where're you going?
Oh dear...Oh dear...
Oh train...Oh train...
Those who print fake currencies,
Those who charge high interest rates,
Those who steal hens...and goats...
Better reform yourselves
within six months.
lf you keep concubine
l'll not spare you.
l'll smash those who
abuse their parents.
lf l see the boys playing
with marbles,catapults,
l'll join them happily.
He'll punish those who
commit mistakes.
And if those people realise
their mistakes.
l swear, l don't want anything else
from them.
Son, how did your interview go?
Father, this job won't
be suitable for me.
What do you mean?
l don't want it...
- Why?
Didn't you reply properly?
l would've replied
if they had questioned me.
But they want bribe....
l Don't want it father.
You want the job but
you're hesitating.
How much they asked?
- 7 Lakhs, father.
Father, what's all this?
l sold our fields for 5 lakhs.
l've pledged the house for 2 lakhs.
By selling the fields...
Son, to get something
we've to lose something.
my body to become a policeman.
As my father was unable
to give a mere Rs.8000,
l was unable to get
that job.
On the first day when
l worked in the fields.
l can't express the anguish
which l went through.
You shouldn't face
similar situation.
You should get that job.
l started my work sincerely
in the office.
But it's feed back was....
Politicians problems...
l got a bad name
among higher officials.
l got transferred frequently.
Atlast, they transferred
me to Trichy.
What's this, man?
You've joined very recently and you're
refusing to accept bribe from us!
You must've got this job
by giving bribe.
When are you going to get that money back?
You take as much as you want &
don't bother about it.
Sorry sir.
You should stop illicit liquor trade
rowdism & vandalism.
Or else, l've to do my duty.
You should've given them,
saying ''Pattu has given it''.
l told them. But they've the
support of the new DCP.
Can you pound without a pestle?
Can you be in politics without rowdism?
You can't, isn't it?
Then, why've you arrested him?
Release him.
Do you've bail order?
You're a policeman, right?
Don't you know?
Today is Sunday. Can a bail order be got today?
l'll get it tomorrow
release him now.
FlR is registered. l can't release him
without bail order.
FlR! Tear it
& throw it away.
Beat him & lock him inside.
Did you hit our ward officer?
lf l hit him, He'll turn into pulp.
Why did you hit him?
Hey, as you've come in uniform,
you've saved your skin.
Or else, l would've bashed you nicely.
We should immediately transfer him.
Transfer, won't be enough.
Like branding the cows coming for sale,
We should
confine him to his house, without hitting him.
We should teach him that politicians
are born criminals.
We're from vigilance department.
We've got the information that
you've taken bribe.
We've to check your jeep.
For my sincerity...They suspended me
accusing me of taking bribe.
You should definitely attend the
marriage with your family.
Will l fail to attend
Saamy's marriage?
lt seems, our kinsman is coming.
Welcome kinsman....
- Come here....
What's it?
First stop distributing
the invitations.
This marriage won't be performed
- What do you mean?
Your son has been arrested for
taking bribe in a prostitution case.
Don't cast wrong aspersions.
Hey, who hasn't taken bribe
in the country?
No fool will take bribe & get his name
published in the paper.
No. This marriage won't be performed.
You stop this marriage.
Father...
Do you also believe it?
l won't believe even if
Lord Muruga comes & says.
You won't do a wrong thing.
Our village people say that you
want to multiply 7 lakhs into 70 lakhs.
Let them talk.
This's the punishment
for being honest.
Justice & law are dead.
What did law do to you,
for being honest?
lt suspended you & made you
to stay in the house.
Being brave is not enough,
you should be intelligent also.
Without taking bribe....
They accused you of taking bribe.
Hereafter, you take bribe
& do good things.
You create a law for yourself.
There may be 100's of
bad people in a place.
Forget about them.
ln the same place there may
be four good people.
You do good to them.
ln Epic Ramayanam, if Vali was
a good person.
Raman would've hit him
facing him.
Since he was a bad persons
be hit him from behind.
According to the rules of
the war, it's a sin.
But, according to human law
it's right.
Saamy, l had lost 5 children
before you were born...
You're my 6th child. That's why
l named you Arusaamy.
You were born after
killing five children.
You do anything for good things.
You kill anyone.
Nothing wrong in that.
There's no sin in that.
l struggled for six months to prove
myself innocent in the court.
We can find Politicians & rich men
in all the places.
l can't reform all of them.
That's why, as my father had said,
l changed myself.
Or else, l wouldn't have stayed for
such a long time in this place.
Bhuvana, l didn't take bribe
from the public.
l took bribe from the evil persons
who deceive the Government.
Bribe, which l'm taking is like
offerings to God.
lt'll go to temple's trust
but not to God.
Believe me.
Hey, what's our caste & tradition.
We don't know who's he...
You've done such a mistake.
Mother, he's a good person.
What's your age? Why do
you think like this?
You call & talk to him... - Shut up.
That's why l wanted you,
to check whether your daughter is going
to college or somewhere else. - Silence.
At this vulnerable age of falling in love,
lt's your mistake to send her
to college.
Now, who'll take the responsibility?
You call & talk to him.
- What to talk?
At teenage, while she is going
to college,
lf you wish to marry her,
then, the family will be in problem.
Will you please shut up?
Look, she won't be reformed by
pouring water on her.
You call that boy & talk to him.
That'll be better.
You take coffee.
To dissolve the sugar you mix the coffee well.
Tumble the coffee well.
Only then, sugar will be dissolved.
lt may be Hot...Cool it
and drink.
Don't sip...Pour it in
your mouth.
They're giving such elaborate instructions
for drinking coffee. Very funny!
We can't even imagine that our
girl loves a police officer.
Grandma, it's wrong to love a thief.
We're different from you.
With what faith can we marry
our daughter to you?
Apart from being a good husband
and a good son-in-law,
l'll be your son...You believe my words &
get your daughter married to me.
She's a very young girl. Not even
finished her college.
Before that, how can we
perform her marriage?
Don't worry, l'll treat your daughter
as a child. l'll keep her happy.
lf we accept your proposal
how much dowry will you expect?
You give me one sovereign
of gold & Re.1 .
Rs.1 ...What's this?
He's asking like CM's salary.
Sir, do you consider us
beggars? - That's it.
My sons's monthly salary
is Rs.7000.
Our women earn Rs.10,000
monthly by packing spices.
Our son-in-law. - Why do you talk
about all that now? Forget it.
Let's talk about other things.
- Okay, let's forget it.
We'll offer you generously...
You ask unhesitatingly.
Then, you give one lakh &
What's this? You're asking
in PM's range.
l don't want anything. You give me only
your daughter. That's enough.
l'm living for Bhuvana.
Till l'm alive, l want to
live for Bhuvana.
Bless me.
Hubby...
May you long live.
First son-in-law is a priest
& 2nd one is a policeman.
Grandpa...
What's it? Hubby...
- We like you very much.
l don't like this.
Your face shows that you're not happy.
Sir, l'll wait till you believe me
comprehensively.
Sir, you seem to be a good person.
But, l've about 400 relatives
in `Ambasamudhiram'.
l don't know what to
tell them. - Uncle.
You forget about 400 persons.
You select a good person.
Srinivasa, if l had a son & sought your
daughter's alliance, won't You accept?
l'm considering him as my son &
asking your daughter's hand.
That day, when l fell at your feet
you said, ''l'm like your father.''
l don't know what you meant by that.
But, l consider you as my son.
Why're you still thinking?
Say `yes'. - Okay.
ln the year of `Chitra Banu'
on Jan 4th...
Palani Sriram Chokka Lingam's son
Saamy Arusaamy.
ls this the one...
ls this the day which
l was expecting.
ls he the one.
ls he the groom,
who will garland me?
Now, my dreams are coming true...
But, l've become your partner.
The days which l count for the
marriage, are a pleasant burden...
Without separating the lips &
without raising the voice.
l'll sing a song for myself.
Hereafter, the drama which we'll
play in the house will be pleasant.
Your eyes will search
me every where.
You'll find me near the stair case.
You'll act as though,
you haven't seen me.
You'll embrace me.
You'll hug me in the
middle of the stair case.
Fear will beget fear &
it'll vanish.
Shyness will feel shy &
vanish.
You'll prepare lunch by yourself
on Sunday afternoons.
You'll ask me to watch
the fun & wash my clothes.
The entire town is afraid of you.
But, you behave like a child with me.
l'll feel proud of me.
We both are made for each other!
My heart is drenched with happiness.
My world will blossom.
There's no inter-caste anomaly.
There's no inter-caste anomaly.
Sir, read `Konar Tamil'.
l ate at `Devar's mess.
l had tea in a `Nair's shop'.
l bought provisions
from Nadar's shop.
l borrowed money from
chettiar's house.
Sir, how can we believe that
there's no caste system .
Wow, he has put me in a fix.
Sir...Greetings sir...
What do you want, man?
My son is a good student.
but they aren't admitting him in the school.
Aren't they?
Sir, greetings... - Greetings.
This boy is from a poor family
but studies well.
Give him a seat.
l can't give him admission in
a convent school. - Why?
His parents are uneducated.
Then, do one thing.
First give admission to the parents.
Let them obtain their degrees.
Then admit him.
Priest what're you blabbering?
l'm not blabbering, this child
is going to study.
His parent's age is around 40.
How will they study now?
lf parents are educated, only then
they can teach their children.
Then, why're you here working as
a teacher? - Come here.
What's it? - Here, you've to give
donation to get admission.
Okay, you get it from
those who have.
He's poor, but he studies well...
Give him a seat.
What is he going to
do after studying?
Children's education will uplift lndia.
So said by Dr.Abdul Kalam whose
photo you've hung on the wall.
And you're refusing to give education
to a poor student.
ls it not injustice?
They all belongs to
cloth less caste.
So, clothes is the criteria, isn't it?.
- Yes.
l'll solve it now itself.
Hands up, boy...
Why does a chair need a cloth?
You need a shirt.
He has a shirt.
Give him a seat now.
ls shirt alone enough?
- Then, do you want pant also?
ls this okay for a pant?
- Oh God...l'll give him a seat.
Take him.
Sir, did my son get admission?
He got a seat & shirt also.
How did you wangle it?
l told the truth.
On January 12th,
The opposition party badmouthed
the ruling party leader.
So, the ruling party has decided to go
for one day's strike in the city.
Hey, it's a bandh of our party.
No one should come out.
Even tea or petty shops
shouldn't open.
lnform our henchmen in
all the areas. - Yes boss.
Sir, if there's bandh before `Pongal' fetival?
How will it be?
lt's a bandh called by the ruling party
so, close all your shops.
Government is not supporting it.
lt's ruling party's Bandh.
These are all perishable goods
we can't store them.
We've bought goods
on high interest rates.
Sir, if you insist like this
what can we do?
lf we close our shops,
business will suffer a great loss.
Okay, you all sign on a paper
demanding protection.
l'll see to rest of the things.
- Thank you very much, sir.
Sir Annachi is involved
in this affair.
Do we've to interfere in this?
All hard workers are
suffering a lot.
Forget about that man...
Sir, who's on duty in Palayamkottai?
- Kumarasamy.
Whoever creates problem,
put him in jail. - Okay sir.
We learnt about today's Bandh
only from the newspaper.
Sir, as you had said, l've given
security to the entire state.
Not only here, there won't be
any problem at any place.
Police chases & beats the rowdies.
Till Saamy sir is there,
l can bravely open the shop.
Thank you, sir... Long live, sir...
Hello, who's it? Annachi has gone out.
Put down your phone..
Saamy is not a human being.
Truly, he's a God.
Very good, Paramasivam...
You're protecting the Public
against ruling Party's bandh.
Whether it's ruling
or opposition Party.
l'll give importance to the Public.
lf he wasn't there, we couldn't
have run the business.
They've won & we've lost.
Bandh announced by ruling Party
passed off peacefully.
Except in Tirunelveli, there was no
disturbance in daily routines.
All the shops were open.
There were no untoward incidents.
Start the car.
Annachi, don't be in a hurry.
Everything is over.
Now, if you hit him...
He's a cheat. l didn't refer to him.
How dare businessmen
open their shops?
lt's all because of
that Saamy's support.
They know what'll happen if
they act against Annachi.
Annachi, coming Friday,
Saamy is going to get married.
At that time, all Police men will
be in the marriage hall.
On that day, let's show the
businessmen our true colour.
Their corpses should be
telecast in the T.V.
On Bogi festival, people burn all the rubbish,
And create pollution generating
Carbon-monoxide & dioxide.
People have already created a hole
in the Ozone layer.
Don't know where they are going
to create more holes.
Aunt, stop.
lt seems Uncle sleeps on this mat.
Are you going to put it in the fire?
lt has become old.
- Do you mean Uncle?
Shut up!
lf you give it to people who don't
have mat, they can sleep on it. Give it to me.
Shut up & get lost.
Uncle, please stop. What're you
putting in the fire.
Old clothes.
They may be old for you,
but they're new for them.
lf you give them they'll wear them.
- lt's good to burn old things.
The proverb says ''Discard old things &
accept the new ones''.
That is what Bogi festival is for, isn't it?
So, anything which is old can
be put in the fire, isn't it? - Sure.
Hey, what're you doing?
This is the oldest thing
in the entire District.
l'm going to put this in the fire.
And enjoy Bogi festival.
Hey, don't harm him. - Why?
He's my brother.
Let him be your brother or anyone.
First keep the clothes down.
Only then, l won't put him
in the fire. - Get lost.
Children, take the clothes.
Thanks Uncle.
- l used you for a good cause.
Don't be afraid. l won't put you
in the fire.
Come. Let's go to your house &
have a cup of coffee. come..
Open your eyes.
Hey, it's been 2 days since he died.
And you're celebrating
Bogi festival!
You shouldn't celebrate
even Pongal festival which comes later..
Stop it!
How long will you be playing
the same music?
Beat the drum in the modern trend.
Come.. come.. You must eat & go.
My stomach is upset.
Then, eat & discard your waste
in a corner.
Stupid! Doesn't know what to
talk in a marriage.
Hey, leave me... leave me..
Hey, why're you doing like this?
How dare you defy our boss &
open the shop?
Beat the drum.
Sir.. sir..
Annachi's henchmen are destroying shops
in the market. - You sit down.
They've killed the shopkeepers.
Not only that, they've hacked
They're hitting women & children too.
Come & see there. - Come.
Sir... sir... Did you see this?
We've lost all our goods.
Look, they've killed our men.
Sir, we opened our shops because you
told us to open them.
Look, what Annachi's men have
done to us?
Look there, they've destroyed
all the shops.
He was in the market.
They killed him & went away.
l don't know what to do.
l'm clueless.
Did you see? Look how brutal they are.
We opened our shops because
you told us to open them.
Scoundrels, they've killed our men.
Look at this brutality!
What crime have we committed?
Why should we suffer like this?
Stop madam.. stop..
Look at this brutality.
They all opened the shops because we
told them to open.
What should we do with Annachi?
What're we going to do for them?
Stop sir.
Come Saamy.
Have you come to get my blessings
after marriage.
Where's your wife?
Hey stop!
Hey, do you know the value of life?
Since your name is Saamy, did you
think you're God of this City?
Who permitted you to give them
Police protection?
Whom do l have to ask?
- You must ask me.
Are you the Collector or
the Government?
l'm more than that.
With Rs.13,000 salary, 2 sets
of uniforms & a pair of shoes,
Controlling 4 police stations
& 40 police men,
You've so much of arrogance?
l control 8 districts,
And l control the Government.
How arrogant l should be?
Hey, l read 20 Newspapers a day.
Do you think it's easy to
indulge in Politics?
My high command is continuously
seeking information about the strike.
Will you answer them?
l don't have any value
for lives.
You made me lose my honour.
So, l took revenge.
lf you wanted to take revenge,
You must've fought with me for
giving them protection.
But you've killed innocent
businessmen.
You've broken the heads of women
& children too.
Who'll answer their families?
You people get salaries to die.
You're proud that you're part of
the fighting force, aren't you?
You must die when it
comes to fight.
Hey, we'll compensate for the
lost lives & damaged shops.
You Police dogs will wag your tail
if we give you bribes,
Or else you'll bark at us.
l don't bark, l bite!
l would've cut your throat on the day you
entered my house without permission.
l spared you because it could've
ruined a girl's life. Shit!
Since l didn't want the public
to be agitated,
l accepted money from you.
But now they're agitated.
You've showed your arrogance.
From now on, l'll show how
arrogant l can be.
What did you say?
l'll destroy your 92 MLA's,16 MP's,
And your title, Kingmaker.
lf l don't make you a beggar
& make you beg on the streets,
l'll change my name.
Only if l leave you till then...
Take it.
Transfer order!
Keep this as my gift for
your marriage.
You've to shift to another
City in 7 days.
Go & pack your luggage.
l can kill you
this second itself.
l'll kill you & perform your obsequies
within a week's time which you've given me.
Hey, Perumal Pitchai!
On the 7th day when l leave this City,
You'll not be in this City.
Thank God!
What happened? There wasn't any
problem, isn't it? - No dad.
Go inside.
Are you angry with me?
- No, my time isn't good,
That's why such things are
happening to you.
No, you mad girl.
All these days, l was feeling bad
for accepting money from a rogue.
The moment you came, into my life,
everything is coming to an end.
Venkatrama... - Yes.
- Come here.
No Uncle, l've some work
in this house.
Just come & have some water.
No Uncle, l might create problems
if l come there.
There won't be any problem.
l've forgotten the earlier incident.
Come & sit. Mangalam, get him a
glass of water.
Who's Mangalam?
ls she your wife?
She's just a maid servant.
Sometimes, she'll be my wife.
Have it.
How come this vessel is damaged more?
Go inside.
Who's this boy, studying?
- He's my son.
He'll go to U.S. in a few days.
Do you mean Uzhavar Sandhai
. - No, United States.
Who's this boy, polishing the shoes?
- He is....
He'll clean my son's shoes till
he completes his schooling.
After that,
He'll clean my shoes till
l retire from my Office.
After that, will he
clean Aunt's shoes?
Both are of the same age.
Why don't you educate him also?
lf l educate him, then who'll work?
This is the land of Kamarajar,
who wanted everyone to get educated.
And Pasumpon, who, generously,
gave his wealth to others.
How can you make a small boy work?
This is Child Labour.
Hey, he'll study, he'll clean,
they're destined like that.
Hey, get up.
l'll educate you.
What do you want to study?
Law. - Law?
You scoundrel! You've made a future
Legal luminary to clean your shoes.
Which Law do you like to study?
Civil Law, Criminal Law or Company Law.
SHAKEELAW! - SHAKEELAW?
You've ruined him by allowing him to
watch ''Midnight Masala'' along with you.
Who were responsible for the
violence that broke out?
Annachi's 4 important men.
They're every thing to him.
lf you ask them to do something,
they'll always exceed their brief.
The affected people are stronger,
than the predators.
l'll tear them into pieces.
But you all must be with me.
Destroy all his wine shops,
brothel houses,
And his illegal breweries
in all the districts.
There'll be problem. l'll arrest
them & subsequently release you.
Seize all unlicenced buses, lorries and
close down all his illegal bars.
No..no...seize it.
Okay sir! we won't spare any one.
Go & check inside.
Take it.
Don't talk.
Take the bus to the station.
Take the bus to the station.
No sir, don't beat us.
- Seize all lorries.
This is Annachi's Sand quarry.
Don't create any problem unnecessarily.
Hey, stop it.
Why're you taking photographs?
We've to give this news to
the evening newspapers.
And we also need it for our records.
- As if he has come to pose...
Hey, if you want to take photographs
of all those who commit crimes,
Then, there'll be no one
left in Tamil Nadu.
Why do you publicize such
matters in newspapers,
And torture them mentally who're
already physically tortured?
You all can go... go...
You don't even have a moustache...
Sir, people who arrest us,
have a fling at us the next day.
But amongst them, you're the only
one who is so concerned about us.
Thank you very much, sir.
- Okay, go.
Paramasivam... - Sir.
Why're you seizing Annachi's lorries
and closing down wine shops?
All those shops don't have licenses.
All those lorries are
without permit.
l'm following the rules.
l feel ashamed to face Annachi.
He'll spit on us if we go now.
He has seized all our lorries,
closed down our shops & lodges.
He has sprouted just now.
Look, how he's wagging his tail.
Annachi made us MLAs.
Since we live at Annachi's mercy,
We must put him in jail.
Earlier, they used to give
free tea & money too.
Now, they're taking money before
supplying a tea, after your arrival.
l can make out from
your large girth.
Do you consider yourself
a great police man?
lt seems, you'll take action against us.
Are you trying to threaten us?
Answer me, l'm asking you.
l consider it below my dignity
to talk to you.
What's so cheap about me?
l've the right to ask you and
dismiss you.
Go away silently.
l'm very angry with you.
Even my men are itching
to kill you.
One hint is enough
& they'll finish you.
Don't over stretch it, brother.
Just go away.
Why're you calling me brother?
Look at that head constable,
he's elder to me.
But, he's calling me sir.
Sometimes, we've to call, brother
sir, rowdy, rogue, pimp, idiot, fool etc.,
We were waiting for
this opportunity.
Hey, how dare you think of arresting
our MLA. - Arrest him.
Okay sir. - Yes sir.
- l'm a ruling party MLA.
l'll show you the consequences of
holding a police man's collar.
How dare you arrest me?
l'll see you later.
How dare you arrest
this lR-8 Sundaram?
lt's lR-30.
You've kept a wrong name.
l should've arrested you in just an
underwear & beaten you on the road.
l don't want to insult 67,500
people who had voted for you.
So, l'm taking you in a jeep.
Call the Commissioner.
Mr.Saamy! - Sir.
What's this? What's happening?
You've arrested an MLA on the road.
Why did you arrest him?
Last night he raped a woman.
l called him with all due
respects for enquiry.
He pulled me by my shirt.
l've proof for that.
What? Did l rape?
Where's the evidence?
l've a written complaint
from that woman.
Anyone can write a complaint
if they've a paper & pen.
Who's that woman?
Okay, you can proceed.
- Yes sir.
You once said, ''The girl was chubby
and beautiful, so he raped her.''
Look, l've arrested you for rape
without you raping anyone.
This is Saamy style.
Thanks Madam.
Annachi, Saamy has arrested
MLA lR-8 Sundaram also.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Dear. - Go away, don't disturb me.
All my clothes in the bureau
and box are missing.
Will a thief dare to enter a police
man's house? Search properly.
l've searched properly.
Everything is missing.
Even the silk sari presented
by my mother is missing.
Chili powder! You're inciting my desires
by coming half naked early morning.
What?
ls the thief inside the house?
Bloody rascal!
You're that 4 letter word.
Why're you using foul language?
You had only said its rotten egg
& foolish monkey.
That's for others.
Do you know the real meaning?
Dirty fellow!
Give me a dirty kiss.
- Dirty kiss?
lf we both take bath and kiss,
it's a beauty kiss.
lf kissed without taking bath,
it's a dirty kiss.
Kiss me.
What're you doing?
l've plucked out the
gray hair which l hated.
This is `Theft case'.
Paramasivam, we've got a call that a bomb
is planted in Rathna theatre.
We must clear it,
come quickly...quick.
Control room.
Send the bomb squad
to Rathna theatre.
First send everyone inside.
First send all the spectators out.
Everyone go inside,
including the bomb squad.
Go quickly.
- Clear out people from here.
Search every corner.
Quick...quick...
Send out all the people and
close the gates.
Search the canteen. Go...go...
Sir, it's 1 1 a.m. now.
Go to the court immediately.
Or else that MLA will
come out on bail.
Whatever he might do,
he'll not get a bail.
Judge is on our side.
He'll definitely get 15 days remand.
Hello. - Saamy, the bomb isn't
in the theatre.
What're you saying?
- lt's in the bus station.
Go & save the people there.
- Who are you, man?
Check all the buses thoroughly.
Send all the passengers out.
All of you, go this side...
This side.
Hello. - Saamy, bomb is placed under
C.T's statue opposite the court.
Tell everyone to get down from the bus.
Get down...Get down.
Come here. - Sir.
l've a doubt.
You go and search Railway station,
schools & colleges.
Okay sir.
- l'll go to the court.
Okay sir.
Saamy, did you come here fearing
that the bomb will go off?
This is not a bomb that'll
blast but it's ''Zandu Balm'' .
Look, its there.
You would've got tired by
running all over the city.
Your knees must be paining,
use the pain balm.
Why're you staring at me?
l stopped you from going to
court to attend MLA's case.
Go away coolly from here.
Next time instead of ''Zandu Balm'',
it'll be gelatin bomb.
Sir.
Mr.Saamy, what do you
think of yourself?
You're going all over the city
with police & bomb squad.
And creating nuisance to the public.
Sir, a phone call...
Believing an anonymous
phone call you've...
What nonsense is this?
Stop everything and come to
my office immediately.
Sir, the phone call about
a bomb is not a hoax.
lt's true. - What're you saying?
lt was found inside Athangarai MLA
Shanmugham's car.
What happened to the MLA?
Sir, l was able to save the MLA
but not his car.
Hey, what're you doing?
You're not in my hit-list. Why're you falling
into the trap?
l'll fix you.
l noticed all the 7 people keenly
while running out to clear the bomb.
l observed the sincerity in your swiftness
in defusing the bomb.
ln my fight against Annachi,
can you support me indirectly?
Till now, no officer had
acted against Annachi.
lf you're doing it,
we'll support you openly.
For the first time, they've called me
for an inter caste marriage.
l'm very happy.
Move! l want to see the groom & bride.
Move...move...
What's this? The bride looks
like a donkey.
Donkey is the bride.
- ls donkey the bride?
What's this?
You can have marriage
between different castes.
lnter-religion marriages
are also acceptable.
But you've become too modern
by marrying a donkey.
There is no rain for
the past 2 years.
According to a tradition, if anyone
marries a donkey, a chameleon or a frog.
lt'll rain, won't it?
Why don't you marry a lion?
- lt'll eat me alive.
You know that, don't you?
Why're you still superstitious?
You're breaking a coconut
on tonsured head.
lf it bleeds, you'll call it
as wrath of God.
You're offering goat, hen, pig, buffalo
& everything other than man.
Then you eat everything.
What's all this?
You had taken the advance
to conduct the marriage.
Never let go an opportunity
to threaten people.
Take this auspicious thread and
tie the knot. - Recite the hymns.
Hymn?
Stop it. This isn't a hymn.
This hymn is enough for
donkey's marriage.
Tie the auspicious thread.
My grandson is coming
majestically like a lion.
Anyone crossing swords with him
will not be able to bear his kick.
Hey, donkey got enraged and kicked
his sensitive part.
This donkey has become
punching donkey.
You all planned a marriage
of the donkey.
But, this donkey has made
him impotent.
What's this sir?
They're planning a protest for reservation
and presenting a memorandum.
You've permitted them.
Two MLA's are leading
the procession.
Minister ordered me to permit them.
What can l do other
than permit them?
You restrict yourself to
security arrangements only.
Sir, what happened?
- He has given them the permission.
Then, you don't stay here.
- What are you saying?
They all are very angry with you.
They planned a procession.
And ransacked Melapalayam
Police station.
Four people hacked
the lnspector to death.
As the procession crosses Corporation
office starting from bus station.
There's a petty shop
which belongs to our man.
Soda water bottles will be
supplied from there.
That's their first weapon.
Further up from there,
it's ''Kandappa lathe works.''
We'll get sickles from there.
They'll try to attack us as soon as
they get hold of the weapons.
Since the Collector is out of station,
they'll not get firing orders.
They'll cross their limits thinking
that we'll not get firing orders.
l'll take care of that.
As procession nears the police station,
...clashes must break out.
ln that, police station and
Saamy, both must be annihilated.
Files which we can't be closed legally
must be closed illegally.
Sir, you're saying that....
- You'll understand.
Another very important thing.
No pressmen must photograph the event.
Even if they manage,
Only smoke must be seen in
those photos, okay?
We'll be in trouble only if they
cross corporation office.
They'll never cross it.
ls this strength enough
or do you want more?
How dare you challenge our Boss?
We'll fight till we get justice.
Remove... - Poverty...
Don't take away...
- Don't take away our rights.
Handcuff the police.
We'll give them a run for their money.
Today, they're in for some boons from Saamy.
They're raising slogans without
knowing our D.C.
Sir, as soon as we cross Corporation
office, we'll get weapons.
l'll make the first kill of D.C.
- Okay.
We must do as sir has ordered us.
Hello... - We'll be reaching
Corporation office shortly.
We are ready.
- You must strictly follow my orders.
We are hearing. - Okay sir.
Get the ambulance ready.
- Okay, sir.
We are going to teach a
lesson to the police.
Don't take away our rights.
Tirunelveli district is going
to teach you a lesson.
Baton charge.
Ambulance is ready.
Hey, who's throwing
stones at us?
Stop it.
Beat them back, boys.
Baton charge!
Down with Police atrocities....
Hey, stop.
Down with the Police atrocities.
Tear gas.
Hey, don't spare them.
Beat them.
Go away.
You raped my sister.
Hereafter you can never rape any girl.
Hey, how dare you catch me?
l'm an MLA.
Come, man.
How can l fire without orders?
My pistol and six bullets are here.
Then, who shot them dead?
How can l know who shot them dead?
So, l was against giving
them permission.
Now, you're responsible for
all the trouble.
Okay! Atleast release that
Athankarai Shanmugam.
Till l get clear evidence
about the death of 3 people,
l'll not release them.
Are you talking so bravely as your
records are straight?
You don't know the
reach of Annachi!
l don't want to know.
Greetings sir.
Why're you greeting me, man?
Fire...fire at me.
He shot my men.
You fire at me.
Welcome, Perumal Pitchai.
You've killed my men and accounted
their deaths under communal clashes.
lt's true, l shot them dead, then.
lt's true your men saw me.
But, there are no records.
Hey, are you teaching me the game
in which l'm an expert?
lf there's a reason,
l'll use Government pistol.
Or else an illegal pistol.
A sickle used by anyone
will hurt you.
A pistol fired by
anyone will kill.
Watch out, in 2 days...
How dare you point your
finger at Annachi?
Oh, shouldn't l talk pointing
a finger at him?
l'll make you run away
leaving everything behind.
Down with police atrocities.
People waiting outside will kill any
number of people on a hint from me.
The guns here will fire at any
number of people on my orders.
l'll immolate here for Annachi.
l'll immolate here.
Down with Police atrocities.
l'll immolate for Annachi.
l think he'll really burn us down...
Run away from here.
Run away.
l'm like a live wire.
lf you touch, you can't
bear the shock.
He has insulted us.
Annachi, what shall we do now?
lnform our boys in Kaitharu
and get him lynched.
l was never afraid even when l
went against the British.
But, l'm damn scared
of these murderers.
l'm anticipating trouble here
any moment.
When there are so many
policemen around,
And when they are not bothered,
why are you?
Son-in-law, everyone has come
out with fear.
l don't know what to say.
You both must be safe & happy.
Anyway, you're going out from
here on a transfer.
You go away today.
No one will be in any trouble.
Son-in-law...
- Father, all of you may go now.
Nothing will happen to me.
You don't unnecessarily
make him tense.
Please go away.
Did you send them out to pacify me?
Or are you really confident about me?
lf anything happens to me,
you'll be the worst affected.
lf your confidence in me has dipped
even by 1 percent, tell me.
We'll leave this place.
l've 100% confidence in you.
You'll definitely win.
Brother, son-in-law hasn't taken
any of our advise.
You advise him. - You don't worry.
l'll talk to him.
Are you scared? - No.
Why're your eyes
filled with tears?
Sacred ash fell into my eyes.
Son, where are you?
- ln the temple, father.
l heard you had been transferred.
l heard you're in some trouble.
Shall l come there?
No need. Problem will be
solved in 2 days.
l'll come back there.
Don't unnecessarily come here.
Okay, son.
Bhuvana, remove your slippers and
go into the temple immediately.
Why?
Just follow my orders.
Sister, take her.
Can't you understand why a man
is running away with a pistol?
lf l beat you in front of the temple,
it'll be a disturbance to devotees.
lt's better to slaughter a goat in
a closed area than on the road.
What're you looking at?
God will get into a trance only
when drums are beaten.
Saamy has told you not to go there.
Why're you going there?
No, l'm anxious.
l'll check personally.
Bhuvana, you leave for
Palani immediately. - Why?
We've just 24 hours.
You mustn't get into any
trouble before that.
l'll come there by
tomorrow evening.
Who's going with you?
l'm going alone, mother.
Go safely, dear.
Okay, mother.
Tell me, Babu.
Perumal Pitchai talked to
Pattasu Raman of Sivakasi.
What did he say?
He said we must create a
`loud noise' in Tirunelveli.
l think `loud noise' is
their code word.
ln Sivakasi, bursting of crackers
will make loud noise.
Crackers, loud noise?
Anything connected with bomb?
lt must be a bomb.
l want to talk to you...Come...
No. l'll get into the jeep
without warrant.
l've not come in a jeep.
You're facing charges of 4 murders, arson,
stabbing and many other crimes.
We can put you in jail
for 12 years.
Or else with one shot,
l can close the file as a murder.
Don't get scared.
l would've killed you that day,
if had l wanted to.
When l shot others,
l saw only individuals.
But, when l aimed at you,
l saw your wife & children.
lf you follow my orders.
l'll dilute the cases so that you'll
get 2 or 3 years jail term.
What do you say?
l'll always keep up my promise.
Okay.
Annachi has called Pattasu Raman
to plant a bomb here. - Why?
To plant a bomb in your house.
What're you saying man?
He has asked him plant the bomb
to go off at 10.30 p.m.
And asked him to stay
at Hotel Sugam.
Sir, let's go immediately. - No.
Let the bomb go off.
What're you saying sir?
This is the only way to
arrest Perumal Pitchai.
He has become an approver.
We can arrest Pattasu Raman.
With this evidence we can arrest him.
- Case will not stand in the court.
Because of the influence he has,
he'll walk out freely.
Let my house get blasted off.
Only then, l can arrest him under
Terrorist act. - Then, Bhuvana?
She's on the way to Palani.
Look, the bomb will
blast at 10.30 p.m.
Arrest Pattasu Raman
exactly at 10.35 p.m.
l'll go & meet the Commissioner. - Why?
Department must know Annachi
has planted a bomb.
But they mustn't
know the location.
No one can harm my son.
lf you all stay here,
he'll give up a winning race.
And spend his entire energy
to save your lives.
So, go to Palani immediately.
No one can harm my son
till l'm alive.
l'll come with him tomorrow.
Pattasu Raman come immediately. We must
create a loud noise in Tirunelveli.
lf we touch Annachi, we'll get orders
from C.M.. Who'll face the consequences.
lf we don't take any action
and the bomb goes off.
Still, we've to face the heat from C.M.
- Everything is your doing.
For the action you took against them
in the procession.
Tell me your decision to
solve this problem.
First, send a message of alert
to all police stations.
Sir, here are the keys.
Shall l get you something to eat?
No need. l'll eat along
with my son. - Okay sir.
Hello.
l'm Saamy's father speaking.
Sir has gone to meet Commissioner.
You call him on his cell phone.
Sir is in a meeting
with Commissioner.
So, he has left his phone with me.
Tell him, l've come here.
l'll talk to him later.
Sir, you got a call
from your father.
From where did he call me?
- He called from your house only.
What are you saying?
He said he had come just now
from your native place.
Oh shit!
My daughter-in-law and her
relatives are coming there.
Take good care of them.
- Okay sir.
They're strict vegetarians.
Tell servants to clean the
vessels thoroughly.
lt seems some Perumal Pitchai
is troubling my son.
l'll kill him myself
and go to jail.
But, l'll not allow him
to touch my son.
Father, come out of the
house immediately.
Why?
A bomb has been planted in our house.
Come out immediately.
What?
Oh my god!
Father...
Father...
Father...
Father...
Father...
Father...
He has been with
Annachi for 16 years.
l wish to become an approver.
l heard about it...sorry.
Best of luck.
l told you to keep cool for 2 days.
Why did you plant
a bomb in his house?
Already he's after you
like a mad dog.
He made a fool proof
case against you.
And has taken arrest
warrant against you.
l can't help you anymore. Abscond for a
day or get yourself arrested.
Whom are you suggesting
to surrender?
lf l get arrested, Tirunelveli will
rise against him.
lnsult...it's an insult.
Getting arrested is impossible
in my life.
Okay. l'll talk to him
once again for you.
Hey, kill everyone in his family.
He has already packed them
all to his native place.
Sir, call from the Commissioner.
An urgent secret meeting has
been arranged in our Dept.
You must come immediately.
Ministers, MLAs, District Collectors
from 8 districts are coming.
You must attend without fail.
Hello...
l'm DC's wife speaking.
House phone is not responding,
l'm not able to reach him
on cell phone also.
Please give him the phone.
- Sir is in hospital.
Why? What happened to him?
Don't you know house was
blasted off with a bomb?
What're you saying?
Don't tell her. - Hello...hello...
What happened to him?
Sir is safe.
You don't worry.
Why did you tell her?
lt's midnight now.
You want to go there.
Your parents are on the way.
Even if l catch the last bus.
l'll reach by morning.
Drop me at bus stand.
Mr.Saamy, please don't
arrest Annachi.
lf you arrest him, it'll
create political problems.
Sorry sir. l don't care about it.
His influence extends from
State to Central level.
You're not going to
stay here tomorrow.
Then, why're you creating
trouble for him?
Ten years ago, you were
a vegetable seller.
Today, you're a Minister.
You own 5 colleges.
You don't say a word.
Why're you talking bad about him?
You're telling me not to arrest
an accused? - Are you Mr.Clean?
You had taken Rs.34 lakhs as
bribe from Annachi. - Deny it.
No.
He has given the list of bribes
he gave you, date-wise.
l didn't take Rs.34 lakhs,
but Rs.36 lakhs 50 thousand.
l was about to tell that he had
left out a few payments.
l've full account of it.
The money he paid me on a date....
l've sent it to Gujarat
Earth quake relief fund.
Orissa starvation deaths,
cyclone relief fund...
To CM's welfare fund...
l've receipts on his name
as money sent by him.
What're you looking at?
Annachi is not a meek cat to kick.
He's an Elephant.
We must get on its head to beat it.
So, l took money from him
and his built trust on me.
Now, l'm beating him.
Then, you took Rs.4 lakhs
from a killer.
And Rs.3 lakhs from a man
who ran over another man...
On what account?
Justice Account!
lf we arrest any who runs over
another man with his car.
You'll jail him for 3 months.
He'll pay Rs.3000 as fine
and goes out scott free.
Who'll feed the victim's family?
So, l took Rs.4 lakhs from him and
paid it to the victim's family.
l'm concerned about dead man
than the killer.
Tell me, if anyone has complained that
l've taken bribe from general public.
l'll kill myself at that very moment.
A man living on bribes will not have
To join police! My father is still paying
interest on Rs.2 lakhs loan.
Leave it.
Are you running a police station
according to law or a jungle justice?
Will you change laws like
you change clothes?
What's so great about law?
When Tamil Nadu was
under Prohibition,
lf anyone drinks in Pondicherry
it's not a crime.
But, if he comes to nearby
Cuddalore, it's a crime.
Prostitution is legal in
Mumbai according to law.
The same thing is illegal here.
A law for each caste & state.
Forget about all that.
l've not yet performed
my dead father's last rites.
You're asking me not to arrest
his killer. What's this law?
What's your final decision?
- l'm saying that l'll arrest him.
l may be forced to stop you
from arresting him,
Are you threatening me?
l came into this world
killing five people.
lf anyone stops me in
discharging my duty.
l'll kill anyone
& any number of people.
lf you arrest him.
l'll hack you.
l'm like wind.
l'll be omnipresent,
but no one can see me.
Neither you can see me
nor catch me,
Hey, Saamy's wife...
- Yes...yes.
Come quickly.
Hey, come on boys.
He has accounted for all the money he
received from you. lncluding interest.
We can't take any action against him.
lf possible try to escape.
Don't disturb us.
Sir, l'm Annamalai from
Madurai Highway. - Tell me.
Annachi's car is coming here.
Don't arrest him.
But don't allow him to
leave the district.
Hey turn the car...turn it.
Good morning sir. - Okay Babu.
Though you've arrest warrant
against Perumal Pitchai,
Why didn't you arrest him till now?
Can you arrest him or not?
What're we supposed to report?
Tirunelveli is eagerly waiting.
We must take out today's evening
paper with this news.
What shall we publish?
Publish, ''Perumal Pitchai is absconding,
police are on his trail.''
Then, can't you catch him?
''Malai Murasu''
PERUMAL PlTCHAl lS ABSCONDlNG.
Sir, post mortem is over.
We can take the body.
l'll light his pyre only after
arresting Perumal Pitchai.
Till then, let it be here.
This is government pistol.
lf there's any trouble, use it.
l'll say that l fired. - For you?
l've...an illegal pistol.
Paramasivam, stay here.
Sir, Annachi has changed his car.
l'll take care.
Sir, l'm Babu from Tuticorin Road.
- Tell me.
As suggested by you, l've diverted
Annachi on the other route.
Annachi, DC is waiting there with
firing orders. Please, go back.
Turn back.
Go quickly.
Tell me. - l've forced Annachi's
car to turn back.
l can't go out of
Tirunelveli district.
l'll go to my sand quarry.
You go underground.
- Okay, brother.
Sir, his car is entering sand quarry.
Okay, l'll take care.
Come man...come.
Arrest me...arrest me.
lf you arrest, you'll vanish without a trace.
Entire Tirunelveli will burn.
lf l'm in trouble, C.M. will
make a call, the next moment.
Next moment l'll be out.
lf l come out...
Not only in Palani, let your family
be anywhere in this world.
l'll exterminate your entire clan.
l'll not spare anyone.
You're safe till l'm not arrested.
lf you're bent upon arresting me...
Then, go ahead. Arrest me.
Who said l'm going to arrest you?
Tirunelveli will go up in flames.
l'll get a call from CM.
Poor innocent public
will be affected.
You'll exterminate my entire clan.
Do l need all this?
You said you read 20 papers everyday.
Did you see today's paper?
''Perumal Pitchai is Absconding.
Police are on his trail''
Why should l be afraid of you & run?
lf you've guts, arrest me.
Arrest me, l say.
lf l arrest you, it'll be
a problem for people.
lf you're killed, they'll make you
a patriot & put up your statue.
And scores of Perumal Pitchais
will generate from under it.
Tirunelveli would be agog
with your absconding news.
Let you be an absconder
all your life.
Let police hunt you eternally.
But, you'll never be found.
lt must be recorded that you
got scared of me & absconded.
Do legally whatever
you want to do.
You can only destroy.
l can create.
l can protect.
And l can destroy too.
Saamy's hunt will go on....
