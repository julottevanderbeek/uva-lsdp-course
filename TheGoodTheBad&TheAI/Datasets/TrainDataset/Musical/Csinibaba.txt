Could you close the door,
or the membrane will come in
and the humidity in the mike
will be ruined.
But I'll die in the steam
if you lock me in the washroom!
Go on, close it.
Good morning to you, blockmates.
I wish you a fruitful working day
on this pleasant summer morning.
Today is August 28, 1962.
Nothing but sunshine.
The temperature is normal
for the season.
Announcement for this Saturday...
For the workers' entertainment
The National Defence Alliance
will be holding their Flying Day.
I expect a large turnout
from all blockmates.
To hell with these damn razors.
Here is an announcement.
The Politburo of the League of
Communist Youth
is running a competition
for those under the age of thirty.
Who knows what,
what do I know... who knows?
Go for it, youngsters!
The situation of the winners...
To travel to and mingle
with the youth of the world
in Helsinki...
at the World Youth Conference.
Where the democratic youth
will meet,
sing and then go home.
Jenõ!
What record is that?
Mary Lou... Got it yesterday
at the flea market.
Wow... How much?
For forty... Don't pull it out.
What's it like?
Awesome...
I haven't listened to it yet.
My dad's gramophone'd kill it.
Now for another announcement.
The winning lottery numbers are:
What? 56?
How can that be?
I just can't.
The fifth number,
dear blockmates
you can find
in Népszabadság.
Isn't it wonderful, Aranka.
that nothing has happened
for years.
You're right...
We haven't had a washing
machine for years either.
We cry together,
we laugh together.
We've no fanbelt, but we've got
the World Youth Conference.
I wish it'd stay like this
for another thirty years.
Relax, it will.
You can be sure of that.
Gotta go now...
Do my rounds.
Go on, dear...
Do the rounds
of your little empire.
I'll go back to the washroom
and destroy my lungs
with that good hot steam.
Simon!
The bucket.
You forgot the bucket...
You've got to get ice.
Lots of it.
Cos our quiet and well deserved
weekend is coming.
I feel a bit low today,
Unhappiness took over me a bit.
I feel a bit like
A sulky little kid
Whose toy's been taken away.
Why did they deduct 200 forints,
comrade?
How unfair!
They didn't give me overtime.
I feel a bit low today,
This lovely world got a bit cloudly.
I've been screwed up a bit,
but it's not the first time.
My heart thinks of you
without anger.
Come on, dear buddy.
Cheer me up quick,
See, I'm about to break down.
Come on, dear guitar,
I need a real song,
To get rid of my complaints.
I feel a bit low today,
Unhappiness is new to me,
I give myself a shake.
You see, everything is fine,
I look at you with my head high.
Dear Attila...
I'm sorry I haven't written before.
We finally made it to Toronto
from Austria.
Don't think that in two years
I've forgotten you.
Katinka!
She's been breathing good
Canadian air for years now.
I wish I could breathe with you
there. And not here.
Those who can recite poetry,
sing, dance.
play music or do a comic act
should register at the local
Communist Youth office.
First prize: a trip to Helsinki,
to the World Youth Conference.
That's it!
Dear Katinka,
It was in lunch break at the
factory when I made my decision.
I can't write down what it is,
all I can say is the air
you breathe gave me strength.
Please give me your address.
Hugs, Attila...
No, kisses, Attila.
Uncle Pista!
Is Helsinki in the West?
- West it is.
- How can you be so sure of that?
It's more like North-West.
East-West. It's up there.
- Friendly.
- Semi-friendly.
Helsinki's in the North.
Why aren't you
in the factory canteen?
It's pancakes.
Haven't got a ticket.
Do you like pancakes?
Come on. I understand you.
I see you got touched
by politics.
Helsinki, right?
Well, right now... it's the West,
but there's a ferry
over to Leningrad.
No thanks then...
Today Attila Bánki,
semi-skilled worker,
asked whether Helsinki
was in the West.
The workers argued over this
at length
meanwhile István Furman,
shop steward,
put the bucket used for stubs
on worker Sándor Gáspár's head.
The ensuing curses did not infer
incitement against the state.
Ibolya, 4/4 subdivision,
Screw Factory.
Date: two shots of moonshine.
It says here the winners
will go to Helsinki.
You get it?
World Youth Conference.
Some kind of huge Communist
Youth Meeting, right?
Who cares?
Helsinki in the West.
We get there and walk off.
Screw their three years
of military service.
You sure?
It's in the paper.
What are we good at?
Nothing at all.
Pop group!
I feel a bit low today,
Unhappiness is new to me,
I shake myself a bit
You see, everything is fine
I look at you with my head high.
- What are we going to play?
- I'll go get some music.
Let's pick up some chicks...
We'll meet at the lake cafe...
- Let's tell him too.
- Jenci!
Have you heard?
- World Youth Conference.
- WYC.
Who? Stop a minute.
You've got something there.
What's in the bag?
Thank you...
Uncle Pista...
Live happily ever after,
with my blessing.
He may stand all the rows.
I'm leaving.
I get off light,
However hard I try,
I'm not down.
Now I'm finally free
I'll live with no worries
My surly baby
won't boss me around
I suffered quite enough
From tomorrow I'll laugh too
Like all others,
it's better that way.
Live happily for a hundred years
You have my blessing
He may stand all the rows.
I'm leaving.
I get off light,
However hard I try,
I'm not down.
It's Saturday...
You cad!
- Hi, I'm Etelka.
- I'm Olga.
- Shall we have a Bambi?
- Great.
- Two Bambis, please, with a straw.
- Right away.
What do you think?
A little romance?
Maybe. Relax.
Play it cool... That's the point.
Summer's so good...
- Everything's full of love.
- And disappointment.
- Mine's the ponytail, yours is
the beehive. - No away.
- Then you say hello.
- The ponytail is yours.
Watch it... Play it cool.
I don't think we've met.
- I don't meet people this way.
- Me neither.
Kuno Purábl, at your service.
I got goosebumps already.
I'm going to be a ballerina.
I can only contemplate marriage.
Can I show you
my most treasured possession?
- No. - Your wish is my command.
- What is it?
Have you seen anything like it?
What's the velvet for?
Is it expensive stuff?
- Priceless.
- Is it from abroad?
May I take it out?
Do you know what it is?
Pig!
I beg your pardon.
What was it?
Gosh... and I almost touched it.
Those were MIGs
and I didn't even see them.
They're American cigarettes.
Look... American cigarettes.
Damn, it's a Chesterfield.
How masculine.
They say there's cocaine in them.
Coca-cola has opium and
sex is porn, my dad said.
Manci's here!
- She's cheating on me.
- You two going out?
What can you see, Mr. Bajkon?
Manci, you tricked me.
Could you tell Angéla
she can look into my telescope?
Can I take a look too?
Of course. Even at home.
After all you only live
ten paces away from me.
But my dream is that
she will take a peak one day.
Angéla! Will you look
into Mr. Bajkon's telescope?
I'm not in the mood,
how about later?
Alright... When exactly?
Hi... The music.
So? Did you discuss it?
- I'm in.
- Who will sing?
Attila.
- Why him?
- He's dying to meet his girlfriend.
- I want to get out of here too.
- Don't yell.
The singer always gets
the best chicks.
- So three guitars and the drums.
- I play the guitar.
- Me too.
- We need a drummer.
Guys, if we pull this off
I'm off to Brazil
to eat bananas
non-stop.
Mr. Bajkon... Mr. Bajkon...
Here's your chance to cut in
and dance with Angéla.
Cut in, out? Look, Manci,
my affection isn't
a rollercoaster.
Son, are you hungry?
Bananas... I want bananas, Ma.
Where the hell can I get bananas?
Your hair's long.
Get it cut tomorrow.
I count to three...
Three!
Good day, blockmates.
I see the Flying Day is going well.
But it's not over yet.
- Could we be on familiar terms?
- Who do you think you are?
Just because I danced with you,
you can molest me?
But I only touched
your knee bone.
Jesus Christ!
What are you? A butcher?
I just...
- You just handle the paddles.
- Will do.
- What are you doing?
- We've cleaving the waves.
Full tilt. What's the water like?
Would you like to have a splash?
Come on, exert yourself,
once you've invited me.
Just a moment.
What is it?
Couldn't we do it now?
What?
Ah... I'm on inspection now.
All right, then next time.
Bye, I'll lock the gates
at 11 pm.
Comrades, I've brought
the directives.
Comrades!
I've brought the directives.
- Who are you?
- I'm Ede...
- Where am I?
- Where do you think you are?
- In the Pioneers' Stadium.
- You got a bit lost, young man.
- Are you Hungarians?
- Course we are, buddy.
Hungarians from Hungary?
Don't worry, we're absolute
Hungarians.
Did you hurt yourself, Ede?
- How do you know my name?
- You just told us.
Where am I? They'll look for me.
Relax buddy... You're safe here.
I'm relaxed. The Defense Alliance
will come for me like lightning.
Got a cigarette?
- Our drummer.
- Let's keep him here.
Could you bring me two Bambis
and two iced cakes.
Two? You mean...
- May I invite you?
- I'll get them right away.
Are you a drummer?
Are you kidding?
- Wanna be in our group?
- Come with us to the WYC.
Might as well. I'll come
till they come and get me.
I'm off to rehearse.
Manci's leaving!
I'm interested in those directives
which were the reason
you flew in here.
Here you go, buddy.
Manci, are you going?
To the movies.
And I have to fix my hair.
On this hot summer evening?
They open the ceiling
at the Szikra.
- What if I...
- It's sold out.
- And tomorrow?
- I'm going tomorrow too.
So may I catch a last glimpse
of you today?
Well, quickly then.
Are you an artist?
The moon is trembling
on the water
The light throws
pure silver flames
How often I've walked here alone
Secretly my heart is waiting
To find you here once again
But only the mocking autumn wind
plays its music.
This song is about us, Katinka.
Before we met at the lake,
Dreamed here at the lake
On a moonlit summer night
You and me.
The moon is trembling
on the water
The light throws pure silver flames
I walk here alone again.
"Dreamed here, at the lake,
you and me,
on a moonlit summer night."
Are you rehearsing?
Talent contest, Helsinki...
I pay attention.
Do you have any relatives
living abroad?
I've no relatives at all.
Any acquaintances?
We'll look into it anyway.
I used to perform a lot
in the past.
Didn't my son tell you?
I used to be on the stage.
But the Movement, you know...
Jenõ said you worked
for the secret police...
Shouldn't we head back home?
It's late.
the lake is asleep
and a cool wind
blows through the leaves.
A yellow leaf
rustles to the ground...
...And I sadly watch in silence.
Now a shaded one...
Wow, that's good...
That's very shaded.
In a second, Ede...
stop fidgeting.
Would you pose nude?
I really must go.
Time is racing
We've been together so long.
- You touched me again!
- It's dark, I can't see.
- You can still feel things.
- That's all I do.
Or should I stop rowing?
There, I'll put them down.
Pick them up and let's
gurgle to the mooring.
Just because it's summer and the
weekend... I work in three shifts.
Why are you so het up?
Did I ask you to marry me?
Marry such a hairy man
with sideboards!
We're sinking.
We're not. The water's rising.
It's a full moon, high tide.
So you're a sailor too.
You said you were a boxer.
IDs, please, and good evening.
Ernesztin! Is that you?
Simon! You, here?
It's twelve years since...
You must be Jenõ.
You were a little baby when...
Give me a kiss.
My son's friend.
Go home, but first to the barber.
You seem moved.
It's nothing. Just the memories
flooding back.
On patrol?
I'm after a pervert around here.
With a coat?
With a suitcase.
Don't you want to patrol with me?
Like old times.
Are you lukewarm or hot?
Remember?
Yes.
We were dizzy, Simon...
I could tear apart these chains
with my bare chest
if you'd say yes.
Let's see!
Kiss me first.
After perhaps.
Show me something, you hero,
now that my evening
is ruined.
Not on my arms.
Keeps you out of mischief.
I want to be a ballerina. I only
look plump because of my hair.
No, you've a lovely figure,
like a spool.
You rude little drummer.
Big drummer... You heard.
I'll be the drummer.
I'm going to the WYC.
Can I sit closer?
Don't be a beast!
I've only just met you.
You know
the female soul is a sensitive
instrument. Not a drum.
Etelka.
Do you know that song
"Perhaps in a moment..."
I was humming it all day.
"Perhaps in a moment,
perhaps in a year
- I will win you ever..."
- I can't stand it any longer.
Ede! I have to ask you...
- Let's be on familiar terms.
- Etelka!
My pleated skirt!
What have you done? What do
I look like? My only dress.
My cigarettes!
My Chesterfields are soaked.
You deserve it. Stupid idiot.
Butcher!
Don't swim away.
We'll build a nest.
This is a strange night,
don't you think so?
Yeah... but why do you think so?
I'm usually asleep by this hour.
- But somehow I can't sleep now.
- Me neither.
See what he's like.
Always following me
five paces away.
- Never closer.
- I couldn't.
You're a saint. I...
You're unbelievable...
From now on I'll keep
ten paces away.
Every guy in eighth grade
was in love with me,
while you chose Katinka.
I stepped into something.
Don't walk about,
stay in one place.
Then I stay in what
I stepped into.
Is that why you entered
the Talent contest,
to go after her?
Quieter!
Could you talk a bit louder,
I can't hear.
You haven't had a letter
in four years.
You think she's still
waiting for you?
You wouldn't understand.
Do you know what love is?
- I do.
- Me too.
How do you know it was four years?
Hello, mermaid-baby!
Don't stand there. Help!
Did you fall in?
I got soaked. My dress is ruined.
What are you staring at?
Why are you so formal?
The night is before us.
I got a cool record. We could
listen to it at your place.
Along with the doorman.
Go to hell.
Doorman?
Are you from the police too?
That's my luck.
First a butcher, then an idiot.
What a night...
Could you send me a locksmith?
You left me.
When I was almost
rid of my chains.
You had a son by then.
I couldn't break up your marriage.
You only saw the woman in me.
Admit it!
Me? The woman in you?
That's impossible!
You could never look on me
as your section commander.
You just kept dreaming in '48,
while I was full of energy
and ready for action.
You were really tender that night.
Our tears were streaming.
Remember?
It was a strange night.
We sealed both sides
of Margaret Island
to catch that black market gang.
And it was so dark
we couldn't see them.
It was a strange night,
The island belonged to you and me,
No one walked on the promenade.
Gentle music was playing,
We just watched the water,
Both waiting for a word.
Then suddenly, without warning,
You came closer
Until your lips touched mine.
Blockmates!
Since then I feel
whatever the future brings
It was worth living for that.
What a night it was
Lights were swimming
on the Danube
Like playful paper boats
The moon was our only witness
And the lights on the Danube
Saw our very first kiss.
Careful, I can swim,
but I don't remember how.
Evening!
Transfer or a through ticket?
How may I address you, milady?
Are you drunk? I've no time.
This is the depot run.
You stand before me
with your tight uniform
and your nice hairy legs.
You arouse me on this
flower-scented summer evening
and you won't even
tell me your name.
It's Terezia if you must know.
Terike!
May I call you that tonight?
While we travel together.
If you like...
But you won't cheat on the fare.
I wouldn't think of it.
But I've noticed
on closer inspection
that you're not wearing pants.
What?
As I said.
I'll order you off the tram.
It's no sin, the heat is awful.
It's no shame.
You're mistaken.
I am wearing them.
Well... cheers.
Are you crazy?
Do you know where you are?
Of course.
On one of the overhead tramways,
electric,
alone with you.
Come on,
cheers...
Sit down, Terike.
It's not allowed.
Oh well...
This is a pretty exhausting job.
To your health!
Seen anything like this before?
Yes.
Do you know what it is?
Don't expect me to say.
My most treasured possession.
All men say that. Pig!
Don't provoke me.
Buy your ticket right now.
Later...
when you're properly dressed.
Look...
I admit I'm wearing only
socks because of the heat.
And further up?
Panties. And a bra and slip too.
I remember...
I put them on at noon.
I'd like to,
but I can't believe you.
I'm sorry.
No one has ever accused me
of lying,
and I won't take it
from you either.
What do you say to these?
It's some sort of trick.
A trick?
Do you want me
to show you the rest?
If you feel so strongly
about the truth...
and it comes from within.
It does.
Then show me if you like.
I won't turn away.
I'll face it bravely.
What do you say now?
Terminal station!
What are you doing?
I just... I
The passenger claimed...
All women are whores.
Good evening...
Give me a double Johnnie Walker.
Instead?
Anything... that does harm.
In a tough glass.
Plum brandy.
Cops?
Act.
What are the chains for?
Virtue.
You didn't succeed...
- Nope. - Is there someone
to take them off?
I've got used to them.
Your jacket looks wet,
you'll catch a cold.
Are you some kind of strong man?
I was Boston's Caesar.
I knocked out 100 kg black guys.
Boxer...
Where's Boston?
Damn far.
I had a chauffeur-driven
yellow Cadillac.
I came home in '48...
My name's Margit.
You know what?
Tear those chains apart.
Attention, please.
Here is Boston's Caesar
who will tear apart his chains
with his unparalleled strength.
It won't work.
Don't say that.
Tell yourself you sent 100 kg.
black guys to the floor.
These chains are nothing
in comparison.
That's right...
These are lousy boat chains.
- I can do it!
- That's it.
Attention.
Now.
Sorry, it won't work.
Something's broken inside me.
I'm a jerk. I should have left
when it was still possible.
If you could leave, would you?
Are you kidding?
You could get out if you want to.
Become Boston's Caesar again.
How?
How?
There's this Talent Contest...
The winner goes to Helsinki.
Boston's just a wink from there.
- Is Helsinki the West?
- You have to try it.
The age limit is thirty.
But I'm...
Maybe with a wig?
That's it... A wig.
And you?
I am staying.
I'm not going anywhere.
But till then I'll be with you
if you want.
I'll help you.
Come on, I'll take the chains off.
What categories are there?
We wouldn't mind going
beyond the Lajta...
My wife is fed up with Sopot.
Sopot or Sochi every year
with IBUSZ.
Turn that dreadful row off!
You can't listen to
Radio Free Europe here.
It's not Free Europe... It's
Luxembourg, and that's allowed.
But not in my house.
Turn it off now!
Turn it off!
I'm giving you your notice.
You're out on the first.
But that's tomorrow.
Thank God!
Dear Katinka...
Things are going fine.
I miss you very much.
I can feel that air which I can't
write about but is to do with you.
This is my 100th unsent letter. Why
don't you send me your address?
Hugs, kisses, I adore you...
I need someone too,
Who is only mine
Who'll be my partner all life long.
Who'll do anything for me.
And wherever he looks
He'll only see me
everytime and everywhere.
I need someone too
Who'll stand by me,
Who is mine
in good and bad times.
Whose every secret thought
I can sense by looking in his eyes.
Someone like me
Who has lived alone for a long time
Who always travelled a lonely road
Someone like me who's been
constantly waiting for a mate
all his life.
I need someone too
who is meant for me
Who's been sent by fate
And if he exists
I will search for him
Till I find the way to his heart
We gotta start rehearsing, guys.
- Otherwise we'll never make it.
- Where to?
- Kisses to you, Margit...
- Keep up the formalities.
- Which category?
- Pop group.
That's okay. The strong man act
is booked. What's the name?
Felix and the Three Tangles
- We haven't got one yet.
- Really, why not?
Let's be the Defense Alliance...
They'd sponsor us.
- Something constructive. - Comet.
- Felix and the Buddies.
Why must it be Felix and the...?
Cliff Richard and the Shadows.
That's what's cool.
But it was all my idea.
So what?
Anyone can be a leader.
Me, for example.
Are you rehearsing?
Course we are.
Trying to agree on a name.
Don't you need a vocal?
Yes, join the group.
Olga and I want
to show you something.
You guys need a vocal.
Come on.
If he had half of what he doesn't
To me half his heart is a treasure
If he cared half as much about
our future as me
I swear I'd forget my problems.
If he had half of what I need
The rest would come naturally
If he only loved me
with his whole heart
I'd have everything I needed.
Etelka!
You were choreographed!
Well, yes...
Who was it?
- We don't even have a guitar.
- The rhythm is more important.
- The bass.
- First we have to get drums.
That's the most expensive.
Solo guitar is cheaper.
Are you looking for me?
- Why would we be?
- You got a problem, right?
I've come to you from
the Screw Factory
to fix the Trade Union
patronage.
Attila!
This letter was in the mailbox.
What is it?
Where did it come from?
What?
Canada?
Katinka, so you wrote
after four years?
Hey, it's been opened.
What do you expect.
Dear Attila... I'm writing
after many years,
in the hope
you've not forgotten me.
I've heard about
the Talent Contest,
and that if you win
you'll be able to go to Helsinki.
I hope to hug you soon
and marvel at the ocean
drinking a Pepsi-Coca-Cola and
enjoying La Dolce Vita together.
It's incredible.
She sensed I was coming.
Drinking Pepsi-Coca-Cola...
Marvelling at the ocean...
Dolce Vita, my Katinka...
Hi, Attila.
What's up?
My landlady threw me out,
but I got a letter from Katinka.
Aren't you hungry?
Let's have some potato salad
at Marx Square.
In the bistro?
It's hard writing letters
when you can't say what you want.
You have to remember
that some official
is drooling over
your loving words.
Don't write stuff like that then.
She's waiting in Helsinki.
I already know
how much the ticket costs.
Great!
She'll write the exact time
later.
Provided we win...
Where's she gonna send the letter?
Where're you gonna sleep tonight?
It's warm, maybe at the lake.
Stay with us... There's a shed
at the end of the garden.
It's even got a couch.
I'd gladly go to that shed
if the couch is not comfortable
for Attila.
He could have my modest
rented room
with restricted use of kitchen.
How did you know we were here?
Did you follow me again?
For once you followed me.
I always eat here.
This is the Lonely Hearts Bistro.
Look around,
you're the only couple here.
Maybe no one understands me
At least you should love me.
Whatever's going on?
It's the potato dumpling waltz.
Everyone joins in.
I get lonely at night
At least you should love me.
Who needs a thorny,
Funny person
Who hides his heart
And charming smile?
What'll happen to me?
The world is so big,
Let's get together,
at least you should love me.
Who needs a thorny,
Funny person
Who hides his heart
And charming smile?
What'll happen to me?
The world is so big,
Let's get together,
at least you should love me,
Let's get together,
at least you should love me.
I bought it for forty
at the market.
Was it worth it?
Have you got a record player?
- I can't listen to it anywhere.
- At your dad's?
Mary Lou at my dad's?
Shu-shu madness
The danger is here.
Shu-shu heaven
Oh, that's love.
I just cry and sniffle a lot,
My tears shine alone and lonely.
I start laughing as soon as I hear
Your footsteps on the stair,
The lock rattles, music flies.
It is full of disappointment
Oh, that's love.
There is no other solution
to my heart.
I beg you, hurry to love me,
Together they smile at us.
Shu-shu madness
and shu-shu heaven.
- What are you doing?
- Tap-dancing.
Did you quit the band?
I run in two classes.
- What are you shaking yourself for?
- He's tap-dancing.
What?
Stop!
Would you stop?
- Why? Is it forbidden?
- Yes, it is.
What you're doing
doesn't resemble tap-dancing.
You shake your leg
like a man who's been hung.
And this whining shu-shu
and doobie-doobie...
You can't tap-dance to that.
I'll show you what I mean.
Give me that walking stick.
Take a walking-stick and be jolly,
Tie a bow form your tie, buddy.
And if your vest is checkered too,
your heart will beat
To the irregular rhythm
of Dixieland.
Ask your grandpa
for lacquered shoes,
Steal out-grown clothes
from grandma,
And get ready to go.
Dance the Charleston
To old jazz
as that is hip today.
Dance!
You should be going
to the Talent Contest, dammit.
He's just like Fred Astaire.
That's cool, Dad...
That's what it's about.
The finals will be broadcast on TV.
We must play
"The moon is trembling..."
- Leave me alone with your moon.
- What about "Dolly-Birds"?
That's it!
Would you stop?
Stop? It's you who should start.
I'm off.
You'll find me under the bed
at Etelka's.
Good morning,
I've come for my suitcase.
- By all means.
- You didn't even go to sleep?
I had to watch last night.
Why are you always star-gazing?
They'll stay there
without you guarding them.
What's up?
Are you going away?
Gosh, Mr. Bajkon,
the world is so big.
I went to the movies yesterday.
Did you see something good?
Not good, sweet.
La Dolce Vita.
I've made a decision.
I want to live like the people
in the movie.
Are you defecting?
The hats and dresses they wore!
And there was a gorgeous
Swedish woman.
She walked barefoot
into a fountain.
We'd be shot for that.
Will Angela go with you?
You can relax, she's staying.
What's my future here?
Husband, kids, getting fat.
I want people to throw flowers
at me,
photograph me, stare at me,
spoil and adore me.
Have you got a passport?
I'm going... Goodbye.
Tell the landlord he can fill
the hole in the bathroom door.
I may not tell him,
you may come back, Manci...
Here? Never!
Thirty-one
Thirty-two
What is it?
Carry on, Boston's Caesar.
Up!
It's you who wants
to get out of here.
Come on! One-two.
What is it?
I'm alright, come in boxer,
I'll smash your face.
Dear Margit, I'm sorry.
Rough bastard.
I dreamt I was being counted out.
Forgive me.
Never again...
Have a sip.
Alright...
I got bigger ones before.
Hardly felt it.
Now run fifty laps.
Only fifty?
Right away. I'm going.
What're you going to play?
"The moon's trembling".
Don't know about the others.
What's the matter?
I don't have my drumsticks.
We're finished.
I'm the host,
you're the bandleader.
- Right?
- What is it?
What's your name?
It's not decided yet.
Know a good one?
The Screw. That's our name.
Our name?
The Screw Factory's our sponsor.
Screw...
I'd rather suggest Scoundrels...
And what number will you play?
Last week's lottery numbers.
Arrogance will get you nowhere.
You don't say!
You're on after the Power Plant.
Well... thanks very much.
Stay put, you're not in the jury.
- Don't say you like this wailing.
- Calm down.
Well, okay.
Think I look under thirty?
From afar.
How far?
Wait...
From here you look forty.
From there?
Forty-five, wait, I'll go further.
That's fantastic.
What?
I don't understand.
From here you're like
a factory apprentice.
This isn't a football stadium.
Why are you yelling?
What?
Bravo!
We're waiting for
the jury's decision.
The traditional Kodály
women's choir
for their medley directly rooted
in Bartók,
their persuasive sound
and authentic folksiness.
A real gem of folk art.
They go to the next round.
And now in the dincy-dancy class,
we have the pretty Echo vocals.
I've known Daddy Kis
and his son Pisti for years,
So I must tell you that
When Pisti was a little boy
he got plenty of attention,
And was scolded sometimes, too:
Hey, you!
And told he was a scapegrace,
Who drags his Mom and Dad
by the hand,
Who brags all day that he's got
the very best sling-shot.
You'd be good,
says Dad, if you ate nice food,
But he said no more,
Just told him: never be a bore.
Pisti grew up,
his amazing hair grew too,
But that was no shame.
He was rude to the girls
and who knows what else,
Yet at home no one told him:
watch it!
For them he was still
a little scapegrace,
Though he was big now,
didn't drag them around.
But it's money he needs now
Not a sling-shot.
It'd be good
if his father were stricter,
Then we could hope
That his son would be better.
Don't quit, girls. Go on.
Go on! Do it!
Great! More!
Though my soul is gentle
and I don't preach
I tell him if he acts bad with me
I make sure there's no trouble
with Pisti
I keep telling him:
watch it, kiddie!
I promise he won't be
a scapegrace again
At most he will beg for a kiss
And drag me by the hand
to the old island
And never again want a sling-shot.
Jury! Stop it!
Depraved. You're right, stop it.
This is an orgy.
They are men. I see that!
Where's the host?
- Scandal!
- Excuse me ladies...
Stop playback music.
- What happened?
- Echo vocals,
are you men or women?
- We protest. - What?
- The insinuation.
That you are a man or a woman?
- Both.
- We are contestants.
Nothing was said about
sexual discrimination.
Ugly jury!
You are permanent, pornographic
scandal causers.
Don't interfere
with the program.
You call this provocation
a program?
We got into the next round, right?
It's not nice hanging around
in just panties.
Ever tried balancing so long
in high-heels?
The Echo Vocals fall outside
the realm of the WYC.
- Cover up.
- Politics.
- Chickenshit.
- Come on, girls.
And the show goes on.
Next comes Caesar,
the strong man,
miscellaneous class.
Don't go to the front.
Stay behind.
They'll notice the wig.
The mike...
I must announce...
Esteemed audience...
You can see this chain
made of Swedish steel.
Boston's Caesar will tear it
apart with his chest.
You're just my aid.
I should have announced it.
Selfish.
You begrudge me the limelight?
This isn't a singer's number.
Keep in your place.
Your wig is lovely.
Not on my arms!
What are you doing?
You'll regret it.
Now free yourself, Boston.
It was my idea, dammit.
Stupid bitch!
Fight those damn chains.
At it, Hungarians!
Long live Caesar!
Let's hear the jury's decision.
The chain got through.
The contestant I'm afraid did not.
Well, sorry...
Thank you.
Jerks!
Rotten assholes.
Get on stage quick.
They need rock and roll.
That'll calm them.
We haven't decided yet.
What?
What we're going to play.
Just get on stage and play.
With our dicks?
- Come on...
- He bowled me over.
I got you drumsticks.
But they're egg-beaters.
Drums or eggs...
Just beat them, dear Dodi,
I love you so.
If only girls would
just get lost.
Silence and order.
Let's calm down.
Let off steam. Right?
Do you want them to lose
all confidence in us?
Do you want the neighbouring
block to get through?
I'd be ashamed.
Isn't the spirit of the WYC
alive for you?
Well then!
Let's continue.
Finally the last number
in the qualifying round,
the dincy-dancy category.
A talented group
from the district by the name of
Screw.
What are we going to hear?
- "I saw her in a bikini."
- "The moon trembles..."
What?
Play that party rhythm one
or we'll go home.
- What?
- "Portable radio"? - Yes.
"Portable radio, rhythm party..."
Don't stand in front of me.
Come on, Screw Factory!
Portable radio,
I always listen to
How they play my song
This music I love, so much.
Portable radio
I listen all the time.
I need no silence
Come yell with me.
Beat it, Dodi!
Life's good in summer
I don't get a minute's rest
Cos I feel the need to dance
Portable radio
rhythm party,
Hey-ho, so intoxicating
Come yell along,
life's good in summer.
Katinka...
What happened?
Angela!
What are you doing here?
Don't you remember?
No.
Not a thing.
I got a headache.
What happened yesterday?
We celebrated that
you qualified...
And then?
Nothing.
We listened to the radio,
I got sleepy...
and now we're sleeping.
We got through?
I thought I dreamt it.
My father!
Good evening...
The thing is...
Angela,
love has caught up with you.
Angela, Angela,
I get dizzy all over
And the shadows turn into light
As I see you in my arms.
Angela,
My little angel.
What are you doing?
Who is this young man?
- Who are you?
- He's got no place to stay...
What's going on?
A girl's greatest asset
is her virginity these days.
And you're messing around
with a stranger
along with my mandrel
and my hand-drill.
What if the plane I got
from grandpa disappears?
- Greetings...
- Mom!
God, you've got cool parents.
I don't want to see you here
in ten minutes.
Give me a good coffee.
Give me something to drink.
What are you so glum about?
You're the talk of the block.
The egg-beaters.
The egg-beaters complicated
our qualifying.
I don't get it.
Felix says we qualified
because of the egg-beaters.
- They judged it as a comedy turn.
- See what you did?
Women overcomplicate things.
Don't be crazy... You're in the
finals and that's what counts.
Yes, we qualified
and we're going to Helsinki.
How'll we get there?
Plane? Train? Bus?
IBUSZ!
No, with a trolleybus.
You got a letter, Attila.
What?
Dear Attila!
I'm standing here
at Niagara Falls
watching the water falling
and imagining you here with me.
You're drinking Coca-Cola,
I have a Pepsi and we enjoy...
Katinka... I'm coming!
For sure.
You coming, Attila?
Too bad she doesn't speak
Hungarian. Look...
The other is Mastroianni.
- A pretzel, please.
- Who was that?
These people do live!
What a woman!
Just imagine!
And here we have
construction camps.
- And semolina noodles.
- And cheap black drawers.
She looks like Manci.
- Damn this life!
- Damn this Dolce Vita!
I don't want to rot here.
Hush! Rot someplace else.
Damn...
Pretzel, please.
Who was it? Don't mess with me.
I know you're all here
to watch that Swedish cow!
Pretzel. Quick.
Who was it?
I'll call a policeman.
Aren't you one?
Dolce Vita...
Dodi...
- Anita, come here or I'll come
to you. - That's right, let's go.
We'll stop the screening.
Quick. They'll stop it.
Anita, I'm coming...
What a riot!
We have to play at the finals.
Don't get caught.
We can't miss this!
Shu-shu madness,
the danger is here.
What's going on here?
Don't you recognize me?
Why are you here
at this hour, Jenõ?
That's him.
Jenõ, is that you?
Let me see you.
You don't remember me.
Give a kiss to your auntie.
Come on!
Didn't your father
tell you about me?
What are doing here?
It's midnight.
Did you break in?
We're rehearsing.
Preparing for the
Talent Contest.
Talent Contest?
I heard about it.
You're so cute.
Where's the restroom?
That way...
I'll be right back.
Don't start without me.
Is your auntie a cop?
Idiots, I don't even know
who she is.
How's it going?
We were at the movies.
Come on home now.
- Are you hungry?
- I want a banana.
You're not a monkey.
Hunger? I can tell
you were never on the stage.
An artist never feels hunger
in rehearsals.
What are you staring at?
Ernesztin, from Tömõ Street!
Is that you?
Aranka Varga,
the baker's daughter...
Where we went for ice-cream,
right, Simon?
Jenõ, go home. The rest go to
the barber. The rehearsal's over.
- Greetings!
- Goodnight.
What a coincidence that
you're on duty in this area.
Public safety throws me
here and there.
But I see you guard
the family nest.
Jenõ's in the Talent Contest.
We agreed that
she'd get out of your life
and I'd overlook your little
affair in return, whereas...
Surely we're not going to
make a drama out of this?
Let's get a shot of
coffee liqueur.
Béla, where are you?
Let's drink!
What movie did you see?
La Dolce Vita.
Dreadful.
Since it's been on
things have got out of routine.
The whole city's gone mad.
I'd ban it.
To our health then!
Wander through the night with me
Pest is worth an evening
Every window winks at us
Pest is worth an evening.
We walk Buda's cobbled streets
Beside the island, by the bridges
A hundred moonrays on the Danube
Starshine plus me.
And if this is not enough
It's just the beginning
You'll see after the first kiss
That Pest is worth an evening
Pest is worth an evening.
Did you bring the egg-beaters?
Are you nuts? I'm a drummer
not a pastry-cook.
Ede didn't bring the egg-beaters.
We can send someone for them.
You want to make a fool of me?
Not a fool, a winner.
Let me through...
Boys,
have you seen Margit from II/c?
They didn't qualify.
I don't need the guy in chains,
only the girl.
If you see her tell her to come
to the basement dressing room.
- Contestant?
- No, just audience.
My friend will recite a poem.
- Come with me to the basement.
- But I didn't do anything.
I can see that. Now you will.
It's in the block interest.
Come on.
Help! It's not the 1950s!
You're right, it's the 60s.
Come on.
- What about my friend?
- Go inside.
Dodi!
I couldn't sleep all night
I was so nervous.
I know, I was there too.
Don't you remember?
Hi, Attila.
We came to root for you,
though I prefer Bach.
I didn't know you were dating.
I didn't want him behind me
all the time.
- I have to talk to you.
- Angela...
What is it?
I must tell you something.
Who knows,
you might win the finals.
Might? We will.
If you do, then first I have
to admit
that I wrote Katinka's letters.
What? Katinka's letters...
I wrote them all. Even the first
one four years ago.
You're making it up.
We drink Coca-Cola,
and the Niagara Falls...
What is all this?
Shu-shu madness.
Manci!
- You're an idiot.
- I'll defect anyway.
Manci's back.
How are you?
I'm at the TV.
I'm reserve announcer for the
Czech Experimental Program.
I'm on unpaid leave
so I came home.
Manci!
Could you put my suitcase
in the cloakroom?
I'd be happy to.
Dear Angela...
- Margit?
- What is it?
Uncle Simon is looking for you.
Margit! Thank God you're here.
Stand there.
Ladies!
One of the women's choir is sick.
They're sure winners
in their class
so they'd go to the WYC.
- What are you doing here?
- Me? I came with Margit.
You should be with your band.
Go on, tune, sing and
go to the barber. Get going!
Could you close it,
there's such a draught.
Which are you?
It said... on the door...
We're the pop group.
You're going to Helsinki, no?
Then you must be
from Bánki Dixieland.
Let's see.
What are these outfits?
They belong to the winners.
The Hungarian delegation.
But... the finals are
only just starting.
Don't annoy me... They took your
measurements...
and didn't tell you you're going
to Helsinki?
The girl who can wear these boots
will join the choir.
Let's start.
Push...
- Small... it won't fit.
- Push harder.
How can someone
have such pig feet?
I see it won't work.
Next please.
It's perfect.
Show me. Let me see.
They're too big!
- I'll stuff them with cotton wool.
- I'll tell you what to stuff...
Go on.
- Come on Margit.
- I don't want to.
Oh, come on, Margit.
Do you want to ruin me?
You can go to the West!
This is more than block interest.
Put them on!
We made it.
The rival group is starting now.
Then it's us.
We should discuss what to play.
Dolly-bird smile at me
Dolly-bird fall for me
You will be my sweet angel
Guardian angel in my life's heaven
Dolly-bird I spoil you
Dolly-bird do be mine
Please forgive me for I
Die to have a kiss from you.
Your colourful cotton dress
is all flowers
Your gentle voice is hard to resist
You're a Pest girl and that's it.
Damn!
They cheated me.
I like the colour of your eyes
But I still don't know your name
Dolly-bird I love you so
I call you so
Dolly-bird, please be mine!
- Let's not play "Dolly-bird".
- I agree.
We've agreed on what not to play.
Shall we go on stage at all?
Isn't that Margit?
What happened to you?
The black cherry is ripe
I take some to my love...
Come on... Go on!
Well we cooked that one.
Boys, you are next.
Is the group going to Helsinki?
How would I know that?
Anyone can win in this contest.
I wish I could be young again.
Anyone can win...
Yes...
But they don't leave it to chance.
It wasn't the world youth
you wanted to meet anyway.
there in Helsinki.
Fix your hair.
Want a comb?
- I've got one.
- Where is everyone?
The whole city is watching TV.
The finals of the Talent Contest.
Imbeciles.
For forty. Understand?
The cover was different.
Let's get out of here.
At long last.
Come on.
Got a cigarette?
So here you are!
- Miss?
- You womanizer...
Terike!
I've looked for you ever since.
- I've shaved my legs.
- Pity!
They were nice like that.
You see? Here is all my stuff.
I've left home.
Do you still have
what you showed me?
My treasured possession?
As you call it.
I figured out what it is.
That's quite something.
Stalin's index finger
from his demolished statue.
May I take it out?
Careful. It cost me five years.
I'll cook for you.
I can bake too.
I'm not a good prospect for you.
I threw things at Horthy as a kid,
then at Szálasi,
then I threw things at Rákosi
and now I'm planning Kádár...
I'll wait for you.
Even if they lock you up.
Just a moment.
What is it?
Couldn't we now?
What?
Like the old days... you know.
No.
Just a bit.
You're a grown man, aren't you?
I adore life, I adore life
I adore watching the stars
on a summer night
Life is grand
I love to give,
love to receive
I love to laugh happily
and obliviously
Life is grand
I adore your kisses
Your trembling lips on mine
I adore jazz playing
I'll say it a thousand times.
I adore life, I adore life
I adore feeling brave
and not fearing a thing
Waiting for you, guarding you,
loving you
Life is grand
I adore life, I adore life...
