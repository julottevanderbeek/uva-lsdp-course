Mr. Adams!
Mr. Adams!
Mr. Adams!
There you are.
Didn't you hear me call you, Mr. Adams?
You could've shouted down something,
saved me climbing up four flights.
A man that likes to talk
as much as you do, I'd think...
What do you keep coming
up here for, Mr. Adams?
Afraid someone's
going to steal our bell?
Well, don't worry.
Been here more than 14 years
and ain't been carried off once.
Better get yourself
back down to Congress, Mr. Adams.
Getting ready to vote,
and they said...
they couldn't settle
such an important question...
without Massachusetts
being there.
I can just imagine.
All right, what burning issue
are we voting on this time?
On whether or not to grant
General Washington's request...
that all members of the Rhode Island
militia be required...
to wear matching uniforms.
Oh, good God.
I have come to the conclusion
that one useless man...
is called a disgrace...
that two are called
a law firm...
and that three or more
become a Congress.
And by God,
I have had this Congress.
For ten years,
King George and his parliament...
have gulled, cullied and diddled these
colonies with their illegal taxes...
Stamp Acts, Townshend Acts,
Sugar Acts, Tea Acts.
And when we dared
stand up like men...
they have stopped our trade,
seized our ships...
blockaded our ports,
burned our towns...
and spilled our blood.
And still this Congress refuses to grant
any of my proposals on independence...
even so much as the courtesy
of open debate.
Good God, what in the hell
are you waiting for?
- Thomas, for God's sake, listen to me.
-
-
- I've had enough of you.
- Now, listen...
-
- Listen to me and forget the window.
-
-
-
Good God.
Consider yourselves fortunate...
that you haveJohn Adams to abuse,
for no sane man would tolerate it.
Never!
Never!
Dear God.
For one solid year they have
been sitting here a whole year...
doing nothing.
- Oh, good God.
-
Oh, Abigail, Abigail, I have such
a desire to knock heads together.
I know, my dearest. I know.
But that's because you make
everything so complicated.
It's all quite simple, really.
Madam, what else is new?
Abigail, in my last letter,
I wrote you...
that the king had collected 12,000
German mercenaries to send against us.
I asked you to organize the ladies
to make saltpeter for gunpowder.
- Now, have you done as I asked?
- No, John, I have not.
Well, why have you not?
Because you neglected to tell us
how saltpeter is made.
By treating sodium nitrate
with potassium chloride, of course.
- Oh, yes, of course.
- Will it be done, then?
John, I'm afraid we have
a more urgent problem.
More urgent, madam?
'
Pins, madam? Saltpeter.
- Pins.
- Saltpeter.
- Pins.
- Saltpeter.
- Pins.
- Saltpeter.
- Pins. Pins. Pins.
- 'Peter. 'Peter. 'Peter.
Done, madam, done.
Done, John.
- Hurry home, John.
- As soon as I'm able.
Don't stop writing.
It's all I have.
Every day, my dearest friend.
Franklin!
Franklin!
Where in hell are you?
I see you hiding behind that tree.
It won't do you any good.
Damn it, this is no time
for playing games.
Franklin, I have been looking
everywhere for you.
Where in God's name
have you been?
Right here, John,
being preserved for posterity.
Do you like it?
- It stinks.
- As ever, the soul of tact.
- Well, the man's no Botticelli.
- And the subject's no Venus.
Where were you last night
when I needed you?
You should have heard
what I suffered in there.
I heard, all right,
along with the rest of Philadelphia.
Lord, your voice
is piercing, John.
Well, I wish to heaven
my arguments were.
My God, Franklin, when are they
going to make up their minds?
With one hand
they can raise an army
dispatch one of their own to lead it
and cheer the news from Bunker's Hill...
and with the other,
they wave the olive branch...
begging the king for a happy
and permanent reconciliation.
Fat George has declared us
in rebellion.
- Why in bloody hell can't they?
- John, really.
You talk as if independence
were the rule.
It's never been done before.
No colony has ever broken from the
parent stem in the history of the world.
Damn it, Franklin,
you make us sound treasonous.
Do I? Treason, eh?
"Treason is a charge
invented by winners...
as an excuse
for hanging the losers."
I have more to do than stand here
listening to you quote yourself.
No, that was a new one.
Damn it, Franklin,
we're at war.
To defend ourselves,
nothing more.
We expressed our displeasure,
the English moved against us...
and we in turn have resisted.
Now our fellow congressmen
want to effect a reconciliation...
- before it becomes a war.
- Reconciliation, my ass.
The people want independence.
The people have read
Mr. Paine's "Common Sense."
- I doubt very much Congress has.
- That's true.
John, why don't you give it up?
Nobody listens to you.
You're obnoxious and disliked.
I'm not promoting John Adams.
I'm promoting independence.
Evidently, they cannot
help connecting the two.
Even your own cousin.
And if Sam Adams can't put up
with you, nobody can.
You're getting at something.
How can you tell?
All right, out with it, Franklin.
What new intrigue are you cooking up?
Let someone else
in Congress propose.
Never!
Why? Who did you have in mind?
I don't know.
I really haven't given it much thought.
You sent for me, Benjamin?
- Never.
- Hello, Johnny!
Richard.
Johnny and I need some advice.
- If it's mine to give, it's yours.
- Thank you, Richard.
The cause that we support
has come to a complete standstill.
- Why do you suppose that is?
- Simple.
- Johnny here is obnoxious and disliked.
- That's true.
What's the solution, I wonder?
Get somebody else
in Congress to propose.
Oh, Richard, that's brilliant.
Wasn't that brilliant, John?
- Brilliant.
- The question remains who can it be.
The man that we need
must belong to a delegation...
publicly committed
to support independence.
At the present time, only Massachusetts,
New Hampshire and Delaware...
- have declared our way.
- And Virginia. Don't forget Virginia.
Richard, I haven't.
How could I?
But strictly speaking, while Virginia's
views on independence are well known...
your legislature in Williamsburg
has never formerly authorized...
its delegation here in Congress
to support the cause.
If we could think of a Virginian with
enough influence to go down there...
- and persuade the House of Burgesses...
- I've thought of someone!
- Who?
- Me.
- Well, why didn't I think of that?
- I'll leave tonight.
Why, hell, I'll leave right now,
if you like.
I'll just stop off in Stratford
long enough to refresh the missus...
and then straight to the matter.
Yes, sir, I really have to compliment
you on your judgment, Johnny.
Whoa, boy. Steady.
You've come to the one colony
that can get the job done.
Virginia, the land that gave us
our glorious commander-in-chief...
George Washington...
will now give the continent
its proposal on independence.
And when Virginia proposes,
the South is bound to follow.
And where the South goes,
the middle colonies go.
Gentlemen, a salute.
To Virginia,
the mother of American independence.
Incredible. We're free
and he hasn't even left yet.
What makes you so sure
you can do it?
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
Spoken modest-Lee.
God help us.
Oh, he will, John.
He will.
-
-
-
- That's me.
Come on, boys!
Join in with me!
-
- When do you leave?
-
- When will you return?
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
I'm Dr. Lyman Hall,
the new delegate from Georgia.
I'm Andrew McNair,
congressional custodian.
If you'll be wanting anything at all,
just holler out "McNair"...
as all the others do
and there won't be too long to wait.
Where does the Georgia
delegation belong?
They mill about over in that corner
near the two Carolinas.
It's after 10:00.
I was told Congress
convenes at ten.
Well, they'll be wandering in
any time now, sir...
with Old Grape 'n Guts
leading the pack.
- Old who?
- McNair!
Grape 'N Guts.
'Nair!
Fetch me a rum.
Mr. Hopkins, you'll be pleased
to meet Dr. Lyman Hall.
I don't need a doctor, damn it.
New delegate from Georgia.
Well, why didn't you say so?
I'm Stephen Hopkins,
old delegate from Rhode Island.
- McNair, fetch two rums.
- I fear it's a little early in the day.
Nonsense.
It's a medicinal fact that rum gets
a man's heart started in the morning.
I'm surprised
you didn't know that.
Speaking as the oldest man in the
Congress, I can tell you right now...
Ben Franklin is older
by almost a year.
Rum!
Tell me, Doctor.
Where does Georgia stand
on the question of independence?
With South Carolina, of course.
Needy, good morning.
Neddy, come over here and shake
the hand of Dr. Lyman Hall of Georgia.
Dr. Hall, this here
is Edward Rutledge from...
whichever Carolina
he says he's from.
- God knows I can't keep 'em straight.
- It's a pleasure, Dr. Hall.
- Your servant, Mr. Rutledge.
- You've met the long and the short...
of it now, Doctor.
Neddy here is just a lad.
He's the youngest of us.
- Except for Ben Franklin.
- McNair!
Your rum!
Where did you go
for it, man? Jamaica?
Well, now, come along,
Dr. Hall.
I know you must be anxious
to meet your colleagues from the South.
Doctor, may I present
to you Joseph Hewes.
This is Dr. Lyman Hall,
the new delegate from Georgia.
- An honor and a pleasure, gentlemen.
- Where do you stand on independence?
I'm here without
instructions, Mr. Hewes...
able to vote
my own personal convictions.
And they are?
Personal.
Now, Dr. Hall...
the Deep South
speaks with one voice.
It's traditional.
Even more, it is historical.
Enter Delaware.
Speak plain, Rutledge. You know I can't
follow a word of your damn French.
It's Latin, Colonel McKean...
a tribute to the eternal peace
and harmony of the Delaware delegation.
What are you saying, man?
You know perfectly well...
that neither Rodney nor I can stand
the sight of this louse.
- Now, Thomas...
- Gentlemen, please.
This is Dr. Lyman Hall
of Georgia.
- Caesar Rodney.
- An honor, sir.
- George Read and Colonel Thomas McKean.
- Your servant.
Dr. Hall.
I wonder if I might speak
to you for a moment in private.
By all means.
- McNair!
- I'm coming! I'm coming!
Help me. I'm stuck.
Tell me, sir.
Would you be
a doctor of medicine or theology?
Both, Mr. Rodney.
Which one can be of service?
By all means,
the physician first.
Then we shall see
about the other.
I shall call at your convenience.
I trust, Caesar,
when you're through converting...
the poor fellow
to independency...
that you'll give the opposition
a fair crack at him.
You're too late, John.
Once I get them, they're got.
Dr. Lyman Hall of Georgia,
Mr. John Dickinson of Pennsylvania.
- An honor, sir.
- Your servant, sir.
Tell me, Doctor.
- Where do you stand on the question of...
- Independence?
Treason.
I've no stomach for it.
Then be careful not to dine
with John Adams.
Between the fish
and the souffle...
You'll find yourself
hanging from an English rope.
Your servant, sir.
Judge Wilson, forgive me,
but how can anyone see you...
if you insist on standing
in Mr. Dickinson's shadow?
James Wilson,
also of Pennsylvania.
Sir.
An honor, sir.
Good morning. Good morning.
Good morning, ladies.
Good morning.
Steady, steady.
Make gangway, sir.
Make gangway!
Good morning, Mr. Wilson.
Good morning.
Watch where you're going.
Over there.
McNair, get me out of this thing.
Watch out for my foot.
- Good morning, all.
- Morning, Ben.
Here you are. Two coppers apiece.
Now, straight back to jail with you.
- Good morning, Stephen.
- Hi, Benjamin.
What are you staring at? Haven't
you ever seen a great man before?
Good Lord, sir, do you have
the honor to be Dr. Franklin?
Yes, I have that honor. Unfortunately,
the gout accompanies that honor.
Been living
too high again, pappy?
Oh, Stephen, I only wish King George
felt like my big toe all over.
McNair! Fetch a pillow
and two more rums.
Franklin, where's that idiot Lee?
Is he back yet? I don't see him.
Softly, John.
Your voice is hurting my foot.
One more day. That's how long
I'll remain silent, not a minute longer.
That strutting popinjay
was so damn sure of himself...
he's had time to bring back
a dozen proposals by now.
Tell me, James. How do you explain
the strange, monumental quietude...
that Congress has been treated to
these past 30 days?
Has the ill wind of independence
finally blown itself out?
Well, if you ask me...
For myself, I must confess that
a month free from New England noise...
is more therapeutic
than a month in the country.
- Don't you agree, James?
- Well, I feel...
Mr. Adams, pray look
for your voice, sir.
It cannot be far, and God knows we need
the entertainment in this Congress.
Congratulations. You just made your
greatest contribution to independence.
- You kept your flap shut.
- One more day, Franklin...
then I shall do the proposing.
Gentlemen, the usual
morning festivities concluded...
I will now call Congress
to order.
Mr. Thomson...
Second Continental Congress, meeting
in Philadelphia, is now in session.
Seven, June, 1776,
the 380th meeting.
SweetJesus!
The HonorableJohn Hancock
of Massachusetts Bay, president.
Thank you, Mr. Thomson.
Mr. McNair...
the stores of rum and other
drinking spirits are hereby closed...
to the colony of Rhode Island
for a period of three days.
- Yes, sir.
- Johnny, you can't do that.
Sit down, Mr. Hopkins.
You've abused the privilege.
The chair would like
to take this opportunity...
to welcome Dr. Lyman Hall of Georgia
to this Congress...
and hopes he will make
the best of it.
My God, it's hot.
The secretary will read the roll.
All members present
with the following exceptions:
Mr. Paine, Mr. Gerry,
Mr. Samuel Adams of Massachusetts...
Mr. Morton of Pennsylvania, Mr. Wythe
and Mr. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia...
and the entire delegation
of New Jersey.
I'm concerned over the continual absence
of one-thirteenth of this Congress.
Where is New Jersey?
Somewhere between
New York and Pennsylvania.
Thank you very much.
Dr. Franklin, have you heard anything?
Your son resides there.
Son, sir? What son?
The royal governor
of New Jersey, sir.
As that title
might suggest, sir...
we are not in touch
at the present time.
Yes.
Well...
Now for the weather report...
Mr. Jefferson of Virginia.
- Mr. Jefferson!
- Present, sir.
May we hear
about the weather?
As if it weren't
speaking for itself.
Eighty-seven degrees
of temperature...
of mercury.
Wind...
from the southwest
for the rest of the day.
And tonight...
tonight I'm leaving for home.
- On business?
- Family business.
Give her a flourish for me,
young feller.
From the commander,
army of the United Colonies.
To New York,
dispatch number 1,137.
Ah, sweetJesus!
To the Honorable Congress,
John Hancock, president. "Dear sir...
it is with grave apprehension
that I have learned this day...
of the sailing
from Halifax, Nova Scotia...
of a considerable force
of British troops...
in the company of foreign mercenaries
and under the command...
of General Sir William Howe.
There can be no doubt
that their destination is New York...
for to take and hold this city
and the Hudson Valley beyond...
would serve to separate New England
from the rest of the colonies...
permitting both sections
to be crushed in turn.
Sadly, I see no way of stopping them
at the present time...
as my army is
absolutely falling apart.
My military chest
is totally exhausted.
My commissary general
has strained his credit to the last.
My quartermaster has no food,
no arms, no ammunition...
and my troops are in
a state of near mutiny.
I pray God some relief arrives
before the armada, but fear it will not.
Your obedient...
G. Washington."
- Mr. President!
- Colonel McKean.
Surely we have managed to promote
the gloomiest man on this continent...
to the head of our troops.
Those dispatches are
the most depressing accumulation...
of disaster, doom and despair in
the entire annals of military history.
Colonel McKean, please!
- What?
- It's too hot.
Well, I suppose so.
General Washington will continue wording
his dispatches as he sees fit.
And I'm sure we all pray...
he finds happier thoughts
to convey in the near future.
Mr. Thomson,
are there any resolutions?
Dr. Josiah Barlett
of New Hampshire.
"Resolved: That for the duration
of the present hostilities...
the Congress discourage every type
of extravagance and dissipation...
elaborate funerals
and other expensive diversions...
especially all horse racing,
gambling...
and other forms
of sinful activity...
Fire wagon!
- Where's the fire? Can anybody tell?
- Looks like the Pepperton house.
- Couldn't be. It's brand-new.
- It might be the city tavern.
Bite your tongue, man.
Benjy, I'm back!
I'm back, Johnny!
- Lee, is it done?
- First things first.
Tom, your little bride wants to know:
"When is he coming home?"
- I leave tonight.
- Never mind that, man. Is it done?
Done? Why, certain-Lee.
Mr. President, I have returned from
Virginia with the following resolution.
"Resolved: That these united colonies
are, and of a right ought to be...
free and independent states...
that they are absolved
from allegiance to the British crown...
and that all political connection
between them and Great Britain is...
and ought to be
totally dissolved."
Mr. President,
I second the proposal.
The resolution has been
proposed and seconded.
The chair will now
entertain debate.
- Mr. Dickinson.
- Mr. President.
Pennsylvania moves,
as always...
that the question of independence
be postponed indefinitely.
I second the motion.
Judge Wilson...
in your eagerness to be loved,
you seem to have forgotten...
that Pennsylvania
cannot second its own motion.
Delaware seconds.
You would, you lousy wart.
The motion to postpone
has been moved and seconded.
Mr. Thomson.
On the motion
to postpone indefinitely...
the resolution on independency
or proceed with the debate...
all those in favor of debate say "yea,"
all those for postponement say "nay."
- New Hampshire.
- New Hampshire favors debate. Yea.
New Hampshire says yea.
Massachusetts?
Massachusetts, having borne
the brunt of the king's tyranny...
Yes, I said tyranny.
Massachusetts now
and for all time says yea.
Massachusetts says yea.
Rhode Island?
Mr. Hopkins.
- Where's Rhode Island?
- Out visiting the necessary.
After what Rhode Island's consumed,
I can't say I'm surprised.
We'll come back to him,
Mr. Thomson.
Rhode Island passes.
Connecticut.
While Connecticut has,
till now...
been against this proposal...
our legislature has instructed me
that in the event...
it is introduced by any colony
outside of New England...
we could not any longer
withhold our support.
- Connecticut says yea.
- Hear! Hear!
Connecticut says yea.
New York.
New York abstains, courteously.
- New York abstains.
- Courteously.
- New Jersey.
- Absent, Mr. Secretary.
New Jersey's absent.
Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania, for the 24th time,
says nay.
Pennsylvania says nay.
Delaware.
Delaware, as ever for independence,
says yea.
Delaware says yea.
Maryland.
Maryland would welcome independence
if it were given...
but is highly skeptical
that it can be taken.
Maryland says nay.
Maryland says nay.
Virginia.
Virginia, the first colony,
says yea.
Virginia says yea.
North Carolina.
North Carolina respectfully yields
to South Carolina.
- South Carolina.
- Mr. President...
although we of South Carolina
have never seriously considered...
the question of independence...
when a gentleman proposes it,
attention must be paid.
However, we in the Deep South...
unlike our friends
in New England...
have no cause for impatience
at the present time.
If at some future date it becomes
the wish of all our sister colonies...
to effect a separation,
we will not stand in the way.
But for the time being...
South Carolina
will wait and watch.
The vote is nay.
- North Carolina...
- Says nay. Yes, Mr. Hewes. I know.
Georgia.
Georgia.
Mr. President, Georgia seems to be split
right down the middle on this issue.
The people are against it,
and I'm for it.
However, I'm afraid
I'm not quite certain...
whether representing the people means
relying on their judgment or on my own.
In all fairness,
until I can figure that out...
I'd better lean
a little on their side.
Georgia says nay.
Georgia says nay.
Rhode Island.
Second call, Rhode Island!
Rhode Island!
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Hold your damn horses.
- We're waiting on you, Mr. Hopkins.
- Well, it won't kill you.
You'd think the Congress
would have its own privy.
All right,
where does she stand?
Five for debate, five for postponement,
one abstention and one absence.
So it's up to me, huh?
Well, I'll tell ya.
In all my years I never seen,
heard nor smelled an issue...
that was so dangerous
it couldn't be talked about.
Hell, yes. I'm for debating anything.
Rhode Island says yea.
McNair, get Mr. Hopkins a rum.
Get him the whole damn barrel
if he wants.
The chair now declares this Congress
a Committee of the Whole...
for the purpose of debating
Virginia's resolution on independence.
Mr. Dickinson.
Well, now, you've got
your way at last, Mr. Adams.
The matter
may now be discussed.
I confess
I'm almost relieved.
There's a question I've been
fairly itching to ask you.
- Why?
- Why what, Mr. Dickinson?
Well, why independence,
Mr. Adams?
For the obvious reason...
that our continued association with
Great Britain has grown intolerable.
Well, to whom, Mr. Adams?
To you?
Well, then I suggest
you sever your ties immediately.
But please be kind enough...
to leave the rest of us
where we are.
For myself,
I have no objection at all...
to being part
of the greatest empire on earth...
to enjoying its protection
and sharing its benefits.
Benefits?
What benefits?
Crippling taxes?
Cruel repressions?
Abolished rights?
Is that all England means
to you, sir?
Is that all the pride and affection
you can muster...
for the nation
that bore you...
for the noblest, most civilized
nation on the face of this planet?
What, would you have us forsake
Hastings and Magna Carta...
Strongbow and Lionheart,
Drake and Marlborough...
Tudors, Stuarts
and Plantagenets?
For what, sir?
Tell me. For what?
For you?
Some men are patriots,
like General Washington...
and some are anarchists,
like Mr. Paine.
Some even are internationalists,
like Dr. Franklin.
But you, sir...
you are merely an agitator,
disturbing the peace...
creating disorder, endangering
the public welfare, and for what?
Your petty little
personal complaints:
"Your taxes are too high."
Well, sir, so are mine.
Come, come, Mr. Adams.
If you have grievances,
and I'm sure you have...
our present system must provide
a gentler means of redressing them...
short of revolution.
Yes, that's what he wants.
Nothing less will satisfy him.
Violence, rebellion, treason.
Now, Mr. Adams...
are these the acts
of Englishmen?
Not Englishmen, Dickinson.
Americans.
No, sir. Englishmen!
Please, Mr. Dickinson, must you start
banging? How is a man to sleep?
Forgive me, Dr. Franklin,
but must you start speaking?
How is a man to stay awake?
We'll promise
to be quiet, sir.
I'm sure everyone prefers
that you remain asleep.
If I'm to hear myself
called an Englishman, sir...
I assure you I'd prefer
I'd remained asleep.
Oh, now, what's so terrible
about being called an Englishman?
- The English don't seem to mind.
- Nor would I...
were I given the full rights
of an Englishman.
But to call me one without those rights
is like calling an ox a bull.
He's thankful for the honor,
but he'd much rather have restored...
what's rightfully his.
When did you first notice
they were missing, sir?
Fortunately,
the people of these colonies...
maintain a higher regard
for their mother country.
Higher, certainly,
than she feels for them.
Never was such
a valuable possession...
so stupidly
and so recklessly managed...
than this entire continent
by the British crown.
Our industry discouraged,
our resources pillaged.
Worst of all,
our very character stifled.
We've spawned
a new race here, Mr. Dickinson...
rougher, simpler, more violent,
more enterprising, less refined.
We're a new nationality.
We require a new nation.
Well...
that may be your opinion,
Dr. Franklin, but...
as I said, the people
feel quite differently.
Now, what do you know
about the people, Dickinson?
You don't speak for the people.
You represent only yourself.
And that precious status quo...
you keep imploring the people
to preserve for their own good...
is nothing more than the eternal
preservation of your own property.
Mr. Adams, you have
an annoying talent...
for making such delightful words
as "property" sound quite distasteful.
In heaven's name,
what's wrong with property?
Perhaps you've forgotten that many
of us first came to these shores...
in order to secure rights
to property...
and that we hold these rights no less
dear than the rights you speak of.
Yes. So safe, so fat,
so comfortable in Pennsylvania.
And what is this
independence of yours...
except the private grievance
of Massachusetts?
Why is it always Boston
that breaks the king's peace?
My dear Congress,
you must not adopt this evil measure.
It is the work of the devil.
Leave it where it belongs...
in New England.
Brother Dickinson, New England has
fought the devil more than 100 years.
And as of now,
Brother Sherman...
the devil
has been winning hands down.
Why, at this very moment, he's
sitting right here in this Congress.
Don't let him deceive you.
This proposal is entirely his doing.
Oh, it may bear
Virginia's name...
but it reeks
of Adams, Adams and more Adams.
Look at him.
Ready to lead this continent...
down the fiery path
of total destruction.
Oh, good God! Why can't you acknowledge
what already exists?
It has been more than a year
since Concord and Lexington.
Damn it, man,
we're at war right now!
You may be at war.
You... Boston and John Adams.
But you will never speak
for Pennsylvania.
- Nor for Delaware.
- Mr. Read...
you represent
only one-third of Delaware.
The sensible third,
Mr. Rodney.
Sit down,
or I'll knock you down.
Sit down, all three of you! McNair,
do something about that damn dog!
- Fetch me a rum.
- Get the dog first.
I only got two hands.
Christ, it's hot!
Oh. Please do go on,
gentlemen.
You're making the only breeze
in Philadelphia.
Mr. Adams, perhaps you could
clear up something for me.
After we have
achieved independence...
who do you propose
would govern in South Carolina?
The people, of course.
Which people, sir?
The people of South Carolina...
or the people of Massachusetts?
Admit it, Neddy. You're against
independence now and you always will be.
Aye.
Gentlemen,
you refuse to understand us.
We desire independence. Yes.
For South Carolina.
That is our country.
And as such,
we don't wish to belong to anyone.
Not to England
and not to you.
We intend to have
one nation, Rutledge.
A nation of sovereign states,
Mr. Adams.
United for our mutual
protection, but...
separate for our
individual pursuits.
Now, that is what
we have understood it to be...
and that is what
we will support.
As soon as everyone
supports it.
Well, there you are,
Mr. Adams.
You must see
that we need time.
Time to make certain who we are and
where we stand in regard to one another.
For if we do not determine the nature
of the beast before we set it free...
it will end
by consuming us all.
For once in your life,
Wilson...
take a chance.
I say the time is now.
It may never come again.
Your clock is fast, Mr. Adams.
I say we're not yet ripe
for independence.
Not ripe?
Hell, we're rotting for want of it.
Gentlemen, please, what in God's name
is the infernal hurry?
Why must this question
be settled now?
What's wrong with now,
Mr. Chase?
General Washington
is in the field.
If he's defeated as it now appears,
we'll be inviting the hangman.
But if, by some miracle,
he should actually win...
we can then declare anything
we damn please.
The sentiments
of North Carolina precisely.
Has it ever occurred
to either of you...
that an army needs
something to fight for...
in order to win?
A purpose? A goal?
A flag of its own?
Mr. Adams...
how can a nation
of only two million souls...
stand up to an empire
of ten million?
Think of it. Ten million.
How do we compensate for that shortage?
It's simple, Mr. Chase.
Increase and multiply.
How's that?
We will more than compensate
with spirit.
I tell you that there is
a spirit out there among the people...
that is sadly lacking
in this Congress.
Yes, of course.
Now it's spirit.
Why didn't I think of that?
No army, no navy,
no arms, no ammunition...
no treasury, no friends.
But bless our soul, spirit.
Mr. Lee, Mr. Hopkins...
Mr. Rodney, Colonel McKean...
Dr. Franklin.
Why have you joined
this incendiary little man...
this Boston radical...
this agitator...
this demagogue...
this madman?
Are you calling me
a madman, you...
you fribble!
You and your
Pennsylvania proprietors.
Oh, you cool, considerate men.
You hang to the rear on every issue
so that if we should go under...
you'll still remain afloat.
- Are you calling me a coward?
- Yes. Coward.
- Madman!
- Landlord!
Lawyer!
Stop it! Stop it!
This is the Congress.
Stop it, I say!
- The enemy's out there.
- No, Mr. Rodney, the enemy is here.
No. I say he's out there.
England. England closing in,
cutting off our air.
There's no time!
No air.
Dr. Hall.
- Colonel McKean.
- Aye. It's the cancer.
But he should go home.
A man should die
in his own bed.
- John. John Adams.
- I'm here, Caesar.
I leave you...
a divided Delaware.
- Forgive me.
- I'll take you home, Caesar.
I'll be back within the week.
Mr. President, South Carolina
calls the question.
- What's that, Mr. Rutledge?
- I said, Mr. President...
South Carolina
desires to end the debate...
and calls the question
of independence.
- Delaware seconds.
- Thank you.
Gentlemen, please!
The question
has been called and seconded.
The secretary
will record the vote.
Franklin, do something. Think.
I'm thinking,
but nothing's coming.
All those in favor
of the resolution on independence...
as proposed by the colony of Virginia,
signify by saying...
Mr. Secretary...
would you please read
the resolution again?
What?
- I'd forgotten it.
- Now, please.
"Resolved:
These united colonies are...
and of a right ought to be
free and independent..."
Excuse me.
Is this the Continental Congress?
Well, yes, I can see
that it must be.
It's all right. We found it.
We've been looking for you
everywhere, you see.
Someone told us that you
might be at Carpenters' Hall...
and someone else
suggested Library Hall.
- So finally we asked a constable...
- Excuse me, sir, but...
if you don't mind, the Congress
is about to decide...
the question
of American independence.
How splendid.
That means we're not too late.
These gentlemen are
Mr. Francis Hopkinson...
Mr. Richard Stockton,
and I'm the Reverend John Witherspoon.
We're the new delegates
from New Jersey.
New Jersey?
Dr. Franklin, I regret that I must be
the bearer of unhappy tidings, sir...
but your son,
the royal governor of New Jersey...
has been taken prisoner...
and has been moved under guard to the
colony of Connecticut for safekeeping.
- Is he unharmed, sir?
- When last I heard, he was. Yes, sir.
Then why the long face? I hear
Connecticut is an excellent location.
Tell me. Why did they arrest
the little bastard?
Our...
New Jersey legislature has recalled
the old delegation to this Congress...
and has sent a new one.
Quickly, man, where do you
stand on independence?
Well, haven't I made that clear?
Well, I suppose I haven't.
But that's the reason
for the change.
We've been instructed
to vote for independence.
Massachusetts is now ready
for the vote on independence...
and reminds the chair of its privilege
to decide all votes that are deadlocked.
I won't forget, Mr. Adams.
The chair takes this opportunity
to welcome the New Jersey delegation...
and appoints the Reverend Witherspoon
congressional chaplain...
- if he will accept the post.
- With much pleasure, sir.
Very well. Mr. Thomson, you may now
proceed with the vote on independence.
All in favor of the resolution
on independence...
- as proposed by the colony of Virginia...
- Mr. President.
Pennsylvania moves that any vote
in favor of independence...
must be unanimous.
- What?
- I second the motion.
- Judge Wilson!
- Oh, my God.
Delaware seconds, Mr. President.
No vote has ever had to be unanimous,
Dickinson, and you know it.
- Yes, but this one must be.
- On what grounds?
That no colony be torn from its
mother country without its own consent.
Hear! Hear!
But it will never be unanimous,
damn it.
If you say so, Mr. Adams.
It has been moved and seconded
that the vote on independence...
must be unanimous
in order to carry.
All those in favor,
signify by saying yea.
Yea!
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
- Six colonies say yea. Against?
- Nay!
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
Six colonies say nay.
Mr. Secretary, New York
abstains, courteously.
Mr. Morris, why does New York
constantly abstain?
Why does New York
simply stay in New York?
Very well.
The vote is tied.
The principles of independence
have no greater advocate in Congress...
than its president...
and that is why I must join those
who vote for unanimity.
Good God, John!
What are you doing? You've sunk us.
Now, hear me out. Don't you see that
any colony who opposes independence...
will be forced to fight
on the side of England?
That we'll be setting
brother against brother...
that our new nation will carry
as its emblem the mark of Cain.
I can see no other way.
Either we all walk together
or together we must stay where we are.
- The man's from Massachusetts.
- Very well. Proceed, Mr. Thomson.
A unanimous vote
being necessary to carry...
if any be opposed
to the resolution on independence...
- as proposed by the colony of Virginia...
- Mr. President.
Oh, for heaven's sake,
let me get through it once.
Mr. President.
- I move for a postponement.
- Postponement?
I wish you the same luck
I had with it.
Mr. Adams is right.
We need a postponement.
- On what grounds?
- On what grounds?
Mr. President, how can this Congress
vote on independence...
without a written declaration
of some sort defining it?
What sort of declaration?
Well, you know. Listing
the reasons for the separation...
our purposes, goals,
so forth, so on.
- Ditto, Ditto.
- Ditto, ditto, et cetera, et cetera.
We know those, don't we?
Oh, yes, good God,
we know them.
But what about
the rest of the world?
Certainly we require
the assistance...
of a powerful nation
such as France or Spain...
and such a written declaration would
be consistent with European delicacy.
Come now, Mr. Adams.
You'll have to do better than that.
Answer straight.
What would be its purpose?
Yes. Well...
To place before mankind
the common sense of the subject...
in terms so plain and firm...
as to command their assent.
Mr. Jefferson,
are you seriously suggesting...
that we publish a paper
declaring to all the world...
that an illegal rebellion is,
in reality, a legal one?
Oh, Mr. Dickinson,
I'm surprised at you.
You should know the rebellion
is always legal in the first person...
such as our rebellion.
It's only in the third person...
"their" rebellion... that it is illegal.
Mr. President, I second the motion
to postpone the vote on independence...
for a period of time sufficient
for the writing of a declaration.
It has been moved and seconded.
Mr. Thomson.
All those in favor of the motion
to postpone, signify by saying yea.
Yea!
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
- Six colonies say yea. Against?
- Nay!
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
Six colonies say nay.
Mr. Secretary,
New York abstains, courteously.
Mr. Morris, what in hell
goes on in New York?
I'm sorry, Mr. President,
but the simple fact is that...
our legislature has never sent us
explicit instructions on anything.
Never?
That's impossible.
Mr. President,
have you ever been present...
at a meeting
of the New York legislature?
They speak very fast
and very loud...
and nobody listens
to anybody else...
with the result
that nothing ever gets done.
I beg the Congress's pardon.
My sympathies, Mr. Morris.
The vote again being tied, the chair
decides in favor of postponement.
So ruled.
A committee will now be formed
to manage the declaration.
Said document to be written, debated,
approved by the beginning ofJuly...
some three weeks hence,
at which time...
Virginia's resolution on independence
will finally be voted.
Is that clear? Very well.
Will the following gentlemen serve on
the Declaration Committee: Dr. Franklin?
Gladly.
- Mr. John Adams?
- Yes.
Mr. Sherman?
- Mr. Livingston?
- Right.
And, of course, Mr. Lee.
Oh, excuse me, but I must be returning
to the sovereign colony of Virginia...
as I have been asked
to serve as governor.
And therefore I must decline,
respectful-Lee.
Very well, Mr. Lee.
You're excused.
I supposed we could leave it
a four-man committee.
Just a moment.
This business needs a Virginian.
Therefore, I propose a replacement...
Mr. Thomas Jefferson.
- No. Mr. Adams...
- Very well. Mr. Jefferson will serve.
- I'm going home, too, to my wife.
- Move to adjourn.
- Wait.
- I second.
Mr. Hancock,
I haven't seen her for six months.
Moved and seconded.
Any objections?
I have objections.
I have lots of objections.
So ruled!
Congress stands adjourned!
John, I need to see my wife.
- It's all right. Come along.
- No. I'm going home tonight.
Of course you are. Of course.
McNair, some rum up to my office.
Don't worry, Tom.
Let me handle it.
I'll get Adams to write it.
I don't know.
He had a funny look on his face.
He always does.
All right, gentlemen,
let's get on with it.
Which of us will write
our Declaration of Independence?
- Yes, I know.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
- That is true.
-
-
- Yes, I do.
- Good heavens, no.
-
-
-
- Oh, that word.
-
- I hadn't heard.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
- Mr. Jefferson.
- Mr. Adams, I beg of you.
I've not seen my wife
these past six months.
"And we solemnly declare
that we will preserve our liberties...
being with one mind
resolved to die free men...
rather than to live slaves."
Thomas Jefferson, on the "Necessity
ofTaking up Arms," 1775.
Magnificent.
You write ten times better
than any man in Congress, including me.
For a man of only 33 years, you possess
a happy talent for composition...
and a remarkable felicity
of expression.
Now, then, sir.
Will you be a patriot...
or a lover?
A lover.
-
-
- You?
- You do?
Who'd have thought it?
- Jefferson, stop right there.
-
- ...
- Quiet!
Now, you'll write it, Mr.J.
Who will make me, Mr. A.?
I.
You?
Yes.
How?
By physical force, if necessary.
It's your duty, damn it.
Your duty.
- Jefferson, stop right there!
-
Quiet!
The decision is yours, Mr. Jefferson.
Do as you like with it.
Damn the man.
Goddamn the man.
Sorry.
Pardon me, sir.
How are you?
What is that racket?
Latest thing from Europe, John.
It's called music.
I came here hoping to hear
a pen scratching, not a bow.
Jefferson,
I know you're in there!
Are you finished?
Well, is it written yet?
Well, you've had
a whole week, man.
Is it done?
Can I see it?
"There comes a time in the lives of men
when it becomes necessary...
to advance from that subordination
in which they have hitherto rem..."
This is terrible.
Where's the rest of it?
Do you mean to say
that it is not yet finished?
No, sir. I mean to say
that it's not yet begun.
Good God!
A whole week!
The entire earth
was created in a week.
Someday you must
tell me how you did it.
Disgusting.
Look at him, Franklin.
Virginia's most famous lover...
Virginia abstains.
Well, cheer up, Jefferson.
Get out of the dumps.
It'll come out all right, I assure you.
Now, get back to work.
Franklin, tell him
to get back to work.
I think he's asleep.
Wake up, Franklin!
View, hello!
And who, little girl, are you?
- John, who is she?
- His wife.
I hope.
What makes you think so?
- Because I sent for her.
- You what?
It simply occurred to me that
the sooner his problem was solved...
the sooner our problem
is solved.
That's good thinking, John.
Good thinking.
Madam, may I present myself?
John Adams.
Oh, and Dr. Franklin.
The inventor of the stove.
Jefferson, kindly present me
to your wife.
She is your wife, isn't she?
Of course she is.
Look at the way they fit.
Come along, John,
come along.
- Franklin, where are you going?
- Come along, John.
Come along where?
There's work to be done.
Obviously.
Good God.
You don't mean to say that...
I mean, they're not going to...
In the middle
of the afternoon?
Not everybody's from Boston, John.
Incredible.
- Well, good-bye, John.
- Uh, Franklin?
- Uh, have you eaten?
- Not yet, but...
I understand the turkey's fresh
at Bunch O' Grapes.
Well, the fact is,
I have a rendezvous, John.
I'd ask you along,
but talking makes her nervous.
Yes, of course.
Incredible.
Abigail?
I'm very lonely, Abigail.
Oh, now, don't be
unreasonable, Abigail.
-
- List?
The catalog of my faults
you included in your last letter.
Oh, they were
fondly intended, madam.
- That I play at cards badly?
- A compliment.
- That my posture is crooked?
- An endearment.
- That I read, write and think too much?
- An irony.
That I'm pigeon-toed?
Oh, well, now there
you have me, Abby.
I'm afraid
you are pigeon-toed.
Please. Come to Philadelphia.
Please come.
Oh, thank you, John.
I do want to, but you know now
it's not possible.
The children have the measles.
So you wrote.
Tom and little Abby.
Only now it's Quincy and Charles.
And it appears the farm here
in Braintree is failing, John.
The chickens and the geese
have all died.
And the apples never
survived the late frost.
How do you suppose
she managed to get away?
Well, the winters
are softer in Virginia.
And their women, John?
Fit for Virginians, madam, but pale,
puny things beside New England girls.
I thank you for that.
Abigail, how goes it with you?
Not well, John.
Not at all well.
And you, John?
- What?
- What are you doing down here?
I thought you'd be up there,
cracking the whip.
- Well, the shutters are still closed.
- My word!
So they are.
- Well, as the French say...
- Oh, please, Franklin!
Spare me your bawdy mind,
first thing in the morning.
Dare we call?
A congressman dares anything.
- Go ahead.
- Me?
Your voice is more piercing.
- Oh, John, look at her.
- Oh, I am.
She's even more magnificent
than I remember.
Of course, we didn't see
much of her front last night.
- Good morrow, madam.
- Good morrow.
Is it the habit in Philadelphia
to shout at ladies from the street?
- Not really, but...
- And for men of your age...
it is not only unseemly,
it is unsightly.
Excuse me, madam,
but we met last evening.
- I spoke to no one last evening.
- Indeed, you did not.
Nonetheless, we did present ourselves.
This is Mr. John Adams.
I'm Dr. Benjamin Franklin.
The inventor of the stove.
