LOUIS GUINARD
Founder President
Dad? Let's go?
Agatha? Let's go.
See you at the station?
Yes, sir.
Right. We'll leave it at that.
To recap: I want maximum info
on 0ur US competitors,
the quanti quali results,
the latest updates
on dermo-kit development
with Estée Lauder,
Clinique, Lancéme,
estimates, release dates etc.
Right, Lucie? Let's go.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
Wish me luck.
Let's hope she slips up
Let's hope she screws up
Let's hope she fucks up
May she bungle it
May sha tangle it
May she mangle it
- Is Monday bank holiday?
- I think so.
What a sha ma!
- Did you put the packaging in?
- Yes.
- The transparencies?
- Yes.
The demo?
No!
Spare change, lady?
Those half-wits will make us
miss 0ur train!
Beat it!

It's beyond a joke.
Paris is infested with Rumanians.
Got the mock-ups?
In the portfolio.
Brussels Midi Station.
Train terminus.
I've always broken new ground,
anticipated women's desires.
One year ago, I decided
with my sons
to create a new line in skin care
for pale, sensitive complexions.
We called it Scandinav.
Today Scandinav is ready,
wa'ra launching it in France
and herein Belgium
during the next few months.
Now over to Agatha Cléry
who's been caring
for this project from day one...
Care is clearly 0ur speciality!
She'll present Scandinav
to you in detail.
Agatha, over to you.
No, no, Agatha,
you've been perfect.
Thank you, sir.
You've won your colours
as marketing director.
You were with Scandinav
every step of the way.
If the latest tests are positive,
which I don't doubt for a moment,
it's your baby now.
How can I thank you?
You owe this position
to your competence alone.
Independently of my affection
for you.

Do you have transport?
No.
Enjoy your evening. And bravo.
SSG YOU tOI'T1ol'l'OW.
Let's go, Lucie.
Don't you lock your doors?
No, why?
At the first red light
they'll grab your bag.
- You think so?
- Sure. Especially this area.
Satellite dish outside,
Arabs inside.
Locl< these doors, please.
With all the Scandinav material too.
Leave it, guys.
Here's 0ur star!
I'm coming!
How are you?
I'm good.
- Have you eaten?
- I'm not hungry.
I'll fix you something.
- How did it go?
- It went well.
- Very well.
- Fill us in.
Oh, bugger!
The Belgians are over the moon.
And...
Guess what Louis Guinard said...
What?
Guess!
No?
Yes...
- Not marketing director?
- Yes!
That's fantastic!
You move fast!
I'm not surprised.
Sha's a natural.
You'll always amaze ma!
She worked night and day.
No more than anyone else.
She knocked spots off us at Uni.
I've been slogging my guts out
fOl' OV€l' two Y€8l'S HOW!
It will happen.
Right. Harvé had to wait 3 years!
In my case the context wasn.
Different.
Here's to your success, babe!
Lool< in the eyes!
Me too!
Being marketing director suits you.
You lool< fantastic.
Do I?
Like you've been on holiday.
Must be hard work.
Batter than a spa!
Ah, Lucie!
- Can you give this to Agatha?
- Sure.
Come in.
Excuse me, this is from Jean-Michel.
Hat is it?
CVs for the new product manager.
He wants you to meet them
and check them out.
Thank you, Lucie.
Thank you!
Your c0ffee.
So how's it going with Agatha?
I'm learning a lot.
You gotta hand it to har.
She's a pro.
She's a hard worker.
Incredibly hard.
She's being promoted again?
Mr Guinard
has made her marketing director.
Agathds very good.
Nota load of laughs...
That's not fair.
She can be very funny.
But not always on purpose.
Like when she's nice:
it's not on purpose either.
- But what a pro!
- No?
Yes, absolutely.
She's superbly professional.
- But...
- But?
No, nothing...
I don't know her well.
But...
Isn't shan.
Isn't she a bit...
A bit what?
A bit racist?
Racist? Agatha?
No!
What makes you say that?
A few remarks she made.
She doesn't much like Moroccans
Not much, no
Or care for the Algerians
Not too keen on Tunisians
Not them either
She's not a fan
Of North Africans
Not her thing!
Or Rumanians, I'll say!
Apart from that sha isn't racist
No!
No way!
Apart from that sha isn't racist
No, no way
She can't stomach the Congolese
Doesn't get on with the Senegalese
Definitely anti the Pakistanis
Can't get through to the Lebanese
And the Cameroonians, Oh please!
Won't even talk to the Javanese
Apart from that sha isn't racist
No!
No way!
Apart from that sha isn't racist
No!
No way, José!
She's suspicious of Asians
Malaysians and Iranians
Kenyans and Indonesians
But she'll bend it for Belgians

before the Eure
you're cutting it fine
after the Eure
you've crossed the line
What in God's name is that?
Roland!
Agatha and Hervé are here!
You're in luck.
The weather forecast is marvellous!
Hello.
Hello, darling.
How's my honey-bunch?
What's Before the Eure
you're cutting it fine?
The county council
thought that one up.
What for?
To mark the county boundary.
- No one will understand.
- No?
No way!
The colour c0de is meaningless!
- It's not even funny.
- It makes us laugh.
Is it permanent?
I don't know.
Me neither.
And you, Hervé?
What do you think?
Do you like it or not?
Well, er...
You'ra embarrassing him.
Can't they Iower the volume
during lunch?
They're so sweet.
He's a clever little monkey.
Children make noise,
that's how it is.
You'll see for yourself one day.
That's not on the agenda.
We'd like to be grandparents.
A chubby young rascal
A Normandy boy
Or a cute little girl
Our pride and joy
It's not the right time
More haste less speed
Starting a family
Is not what I need
My honey-bunch mine
It's never the time
For a baby
My honey-bunch mine
It's never the time
And after the time
You've crossed the line
And before the time
You're cutting it fine
How about you, Harvé lad?
Don't you want to be a dad?
I think Agatha is quite right
We don't have time
to be up all night
I aim to be financially reliable
Before envisaging family survival
It's never the time
For a baby
It's never the time
For a baby
And don't forget it ain't no fun
To have an ageing dad and mum
It's never the time
For a baby
Stop!
Not now.
Her professional fulfilment
is at stake.
Right, honey-bunch?
Don't you start!
Start what?
Calling her honey-bunch.
She hates it.
Don't you, honey-bunch?
Lucie!
Could you get me some Paracetamol?
Of course.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Did you meet the two guys
with the CVs?
Yes.
Schmit lool<s interesting.
I told him to call up and meet you.
And the other one?
He's sound.
OK, but with an equivalent CV
he wanted 500 euros more.
I suggested he reassess.
- He wouldn't back down.
- Forget it.
Anything wrong?
Paracetamol...
I set up her appointments.
She never met him.
Course not, he's black.
It's disgusting.
We've all seen her do it
but we can't catch her out.
She'll say you didn't know
but she met him outside,
something like that.
- How disgusting.
- Go eat elsewhere!
No, sorry.
Hello?
- Hello, honey-bunch.
- Don't call me that.
Hello, Miss Agatha.
Sorry. Where are you?
At the Arabs'.
Where?
At the grocer's.
I've just wrapped up my Koreans!
Can I come over?
No. Not tonight.
Sweeten up, I feel like it!
Ara you deaf? I said not tonightl
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Sorry. I feel a bit queasy.
Feverish?
I don't know. I'm shattered.
Maybe you should see a doctor?
Maybe. ..
Shall I come over?
No!
To fix you a meal and pamper you.
You're sweet
but I have a lot of work.
Let's talk before beddy-byes?
Right.
- Kiss kiss?
- Kiss kiss.
Hello, Miss Agatha.
What a tan!
Been in the sun?
Speak for yourself.
You lool< stunning!
Don't, I feel lousy.
You don't lool< it.
Been to the Seychelles?
Am I that brown?
No!
Where were you?
Nowhere.
UV tanning, huh?
You must be nuts.
Come 0ff it.
And my sister's a Beatle.
Go easy with those UV sessions.
Your holiday was a waste of time.
You're badly run down.
Did I go on holiday?
I don't know.
How do you lool< so healthy?
I don't know.
Doctors are like lawyers.
We can't help you if you lie.
I swear I don't do anything.
Everyone says that.
I know I'm tanned
but I haven't sunbathed for 5 years!
I workin beauty care,
I know what UV and sunrays can do!
I'm not mad.
I'm sending you to a dermatologist.
It's not a haemocyanin.
Or an icterus.
- Is your hair going frizzy?
- Yes.
You haven't tested out
a new product?
- Instant tan creams or pills?
- No.
Any coloured people in your family?
No.
Why do you ask?
We could have envisaged
jumping genes.
As YOU Qét browner,
you feel more nauseous?
- More exhausted?
- Yes.
I'm sending you
to an endocrinologist.
You have Addison's Disease.
What's that?
A rare condition.
I've 0nly come across
But what is it?
A disorder
of the adrenal cortax glands.
Exhaustion, stomach aches,
darkening of the skin.
The suprarenal insufficiency
affects the pituitary gland
and triggers 0ff a melanoderma.
Is it serious?
It used to kill people.
No need to worry.
Now cortisone exists
people live with it very well.
Kennedy for instance.
Kennedy had Addison's Disease.
But it didn't stop him
being assassinated!
I don't understand.
What does it do exactly?
Thanks to cortisone, nothing.
You have to survey the doses
to avoid problems.
The 0nly visible aspect
is a suntan all year round.
In your case,
your ACTH level
is exceptionally high.
So your skin
may darken considerably.
How do you mean darken?
You will probably
darken to the shade
of a coloured person.
What colour?
Swarthy, olive,
I can't say exactly.
Ebony if your melanin level
keeps shooting up like this.
I really don't know.
- You're kidding?
- Kiss your white skin goodbye.
You'll be nothing
like the normal colour
for a Caucasian.
Can't it be treated?
Not this aspect of the condition.
So I'll be black?
You will darken.
For ever?
As medical knowledge
stands today, yes.
But don't worry, as I said,
apart from
the pigmentation,
you can live a normal life.
I'm turning black,
is that a normal life?
Listen,
if you need to talk to someone
there's an Addison's Disease
Support Group.
Black is black
You're turning black
It sets you apart
It's so rare and new
But don't lose heart
Be d00 be d00
We'll be there for you
Miss Cléry?
See you in four weeks time?
Black is black
You're turning black
Black is black
You're turning black
Black is black!
You're turning black!
But...
Apart from
this pig mentation business,
are there any complications?
Isn't that enough?
Things that could handicap you
in your daily life?
What more do you want?
I'm turning black!
Don't you know what it means: black?
You don't call it a handicap?
We love you to bits.
But you're talking nonsense.
I don't want to be black.
I hate black people!
They're ugly and stupid!
They have fat lips and fat arms!
- Who does she get it from?
- Mother.
As bad as that?
- I won't be like a monkey!
- Afraid so.
I won't be like them!
I don't want to be black!
I won't, I won't!
My darling.
You said it's inevitable.
So what's the point of moaning?
Better get used to it
.
I'll never be black.
Not as long as I live!
You can't commit suicide.
Yes, I can... if I must.
Now come on.
Don't be silly.
But...
Will you get much darker?
No!
That shada's not embarrassing.
Thanks a lot!
I didn't mean that, don't be silly.
And anyway...
Black, yellow, white...
- What does it change?
- Everything.
It changes everything.
It's another world!
You're still my honey-bunch.
Yeah.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Why are you staring at me?
I'm not.
I haven't got darker, have I?
No, no.
Have I got a bit whiter?
Well, yes...
It's hard to tell.
- Coming to bed?
- No, not right away.
I still have work to do.
In a bit.
Know why Agatha lool<s
browner and browner?
- She owned up to UV sessions.
- Agatha?
She's lying.
She has a rare disease.
She's turning black.
But how? It's impossible.
It is possible.
It's called Addison's Disease.
What is it?
I googled it,
it makes your skin go darker.
A bit like Michael Jackson
but the other way round.
And apparently sha's got it bad!
No!
You're kidding?
Holy shit!
Incredible.
There is a rough justice.
I didn't say anything.
Agatha!
Here's the meeting report.
Thank you.
Secrets, huh?
What?
Hat?
What hmm?
Who was dead against UV?
I read the latest reports,
it's not so bad.
In moderation,
like everything.
I've exposed my skin so rarely
my sun capital is virtually intact.
Don't 0verd0 it. It gets ugly.
No fear of that. You know me!
Alright?
I think so.
Your mail.
YOUNG AFRICA
MISS EBONY
Your level's even higher.
You'll be very, very dark.
How about more cortisone?
You'll blow up like popcorn.
And you won't even be
pOpCOl'I'1 COIOUI'.
LIGHTENER
WHITENING CREAM
Excuse me.
Can I go first? I 0nly have this.
Go ahead.
Why me?
What have I done
To deserve this?
It's worse than shame
It's deep distress
Making my poor life a mess
A dark mess
I'm no hard and cruel Miss
I just don't want to be
A negress!
But if Michael's gone whiter
Then I can be lighter
I'll be pearly pale pink
As white as an ice rink
White as an ice rink
I'm telling you
Better believe me
Me, Agatha Cléryl

Speed, efficiency, credibility.
Right on the middle of my desk.
Why not tell them?
Because they know.
And they're doing this.
They have no pity. It's vile.
Maybe it's not them.
- I get sent these.
- C'mon! It's every day.
Poor baby.
Have you been to see him?
Who?
Ary Thingummy.
What for?
I don't l<now...
Me see a witchdoctor?
The blacks believe in them.
I am not black.
So what are you saying?
Break it up, you two. OK?
- I'm sorry.
- My fault. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Drink up! Good luck!
I could use some.
Fifty eight, fifty nine, sixty...
But how long are you 0ff for?
You don't know when you'll be back?
I'll have to work round it,
what else can I say?
I don't have a choice.
Lool< after yourself
and come back soon.
Yeah, me too.
Beautiful day
HGPPY day
Hip hooray
Hip hooray
At last Agatha
Is on her way
Farewell, Agathe
Wa'll wave you away
Just stay far away
gathe?
It's us!
Open the door!
It does change you
but honestly, you're still you.
Right. You're still you.
But...
Is it all over?
Just as well,
or it would lool< weird.
I'm getting used to it,
really I am.
I don't even notice the difference.
Don't cry.
No, don't.
We know you're not really black.
No squashy nose or fat lips.
Your doctor could be wrong.
Maybe it's temporary.
I went to see three others.
They all say the same.
What about Harvé?
What does he think?
Nothing.
He doesn't touch me any more,
that's all.
Poor thing.
Poor Hervé!
Lighten up.
You gotta laugh!
It's me.
How are you?
I'm good. How are you?
So $0...
What's wrong?
Nothing...
Coming over tonight?
Not tonight, I really can't.
A deadline for my Koreans.
I see.
Not mad at me?
No, I can't be mad at you.
Well, kiss kiss?
Kiss kiss.
Good bye.
And now, 0ur 0Id friend Nino.
Yeah, right!
It was back in '66, remember?
I'd love to be black
I'd love to be black
Black all over
Hello?
No! It's not true!
Roland!
Agathe's been silly!
Oxygen.
Blood pressure.
We are the damned
Of the medical world
Our overtime paid
In blood, sweat and tears
No bank credit
No renown
We heal when we can
But it grinds us down
Miss Cléry?
Miss Cléryl
It's normal.
Put her on Zeferil till tonight.
Can't you imagine
what it would have done to us?
And your parents?
Snap out of it.
It's not as if you'd lost
yOUl' EYES OI' yOUl' IEQS.
You don't have a squashy nose.
What do you sae? A black woman.
I'm black.
- We know you're not really.
- Piss 0ff.
I see a black face.
Everyone does!
So what?
How 0ften have we joked
about darkies?
Nothing bad.
Just for a laugh.
I've been thinking.
- You're the lucky one.
- Yeah?
You represent 0ur century
better than we do.
Society is evolving
towards racial mixture.
Please! Spare me.
He's got a point.
Racial mixture is humanity's future.
Mathematically inescapable.
Why not Black is beautiful too?
Try it for yourselves
if it's so great.
It's easy for you to talk!
I may be humanity's future
but he sleeps on the sofa.
You make me sorry I saved you.
Face facts.
Get used to your new identity.
Or don't mess up your next suicide.
Come on. Treatment.
Sucking up?
Certainly not.
Trying to top herself
doesn't make har a saint.
It's sad to see someone so low.
Wear something lighter,
it's warm this morning.
I can take it 0ff later.
- Like us to come with you?
- No.
It's on 0ur way.
I'm not going to nursery school.
Just trying to help.
Right, I'm 0ff.
Have you got your pills?
Being black doesn't mean
I'm a half-wit.
I'm glad to hear you say that.
Hi, girls.
Madam! Where are you going?
It's me. Agatha.
Hello, Agatha.
I want to say for us all...
We're delighted to see you back.
Thank you.
You've been through
some testing times, Agatha.
The fighter we know and love
has won through 0nce more.
Agatha,
we're proud to count you
al'T1OI'1QSt US again.
And the best way to show us
you haven't changed
is to roll up your sleeves
and get to work!
Attagirl, Agatha!
Get cracking!
Agatha.
Sorry about all the crap.
We W€l'€ IOUSY tO YOU.
That's alright.
I'd have found it funny
too normally.
Well, that's how it is.
But thanks, it's nice of you.
That's me!
Good morning.
Scandinav is the ideal
solution for all women
whose pale complexions
suffer more than darker skins
from the aggressions
of today's world.
Pollution, stress,
the disastrous effects of sunlight.
Market research shows. ..
Excuse me...
There's a huge market
for Caucasian type complaxions.
So we're launching
a new range of skin care
for pale, sensitive skins.
We've called it Scandinav.
As these white skins
are more delicate,
thay'ra also more fragile
and the da mage
is always appalling...
What brings you here?
Do you thinl<...
I've been wondering...
I'm not sure I'm the right person
for Scandinav.
What do you mean?
Well, with my...
Because of my. ..
Good God! It never crossed my mind!
It hadn't occurred to me.
Really?
You're not serious?
No, but...
What a pity you think that.
Yes, but if that's how she feels...
Scared you've lost your motivation?
Who wouldn't in your situation?
Attagirl Agatha!
No, Agatha
You must follow your heart
You're at the peak of your art
So retire on the crest of the wave
Be brave
We accept with regret
Your resignation
We'll return your stock option
We respect
Your decision
FOI' those many Y€8l'S
Of commitment and loyalty
We'll reward you with
A handsome indemnity
We must start anew
We'll miss you too
That's very true
We'll miss you
Goodbye Agatha
Don't say thank you
It's the least we can do
We 0we you that too
Goodbye Agatha
You're a true blue
We'll miss you
That was closa!
She made it easy for us.
Shame.
I got horny with her black.
Miss Cléry.
I don't want to interfere,
but the body corporate
isn't happy about renewing
your lease, I hear.
Really? Why not?
I think it's something
to do with your new... colour.
We immigrants must stick together.
Thank you, Mrs Goebbels.
Agatha, my dearest,
I'm not strong enough
to see you through this ordeal.
Forgive me.
You're still my honey-bunch.
Your Hervé
PS. I hope with all my heart
you'll be white again 0na day.
So do I.
You're right,
it's great to be black.
I've lost my job and my fella,
now I'm being kicked out of my home.
Surely you saw it coming with Hervé?
No.
You said
he hadn't touched you for weeks.
Well, no...
This way, please.
See that?
He tool< them in before me.
Don't be paranoid. They booked.
And if the Guinards fired you
because you're black
it could cost them a fortune.
If you're sure of your facts,
sue them.
Yeah. I can be a Black Panther now.
I'm not suing anyone.
I'd have done the same.
And gone to jail!
I did it ten times over,
no problem.
Our turn now.
Did the people before us
bool< a table?
Yes, Madam.
I bet he's lying.
I'm not black, I'm sick.
I'm from Normandy!
JOB CENTRE
Climb back up your coconut tree!
Stupid cow!
Hello?
Roland.
- Mum?
- Yes, darling?
Thank you for coming.
What's happened?
She's not in good shape...
I'll lead the way.
What are you doing here?
After-sales service.
What for? Life is a groove!
You've lost everything,
it can 0nly get better.
Sorry but no!
My last few friends can dump me,
my parents can cut me 0ff,
my hotel room can be torched
now that I can't rant an apartment!
Don't talk rubbish.
They can fly me to the border!
Sell me as a slave!
Lots more fun things can happen!
- Are you through?
- No!
I said not in good shape.
Fuck 0ff!
- Anything else?
- I've had it!
Go on. Let it out.
Black is a shitty colour!
Perfect. Talking of colour,
we have issues. That's unwearable.
We'll start with clothes
Don't need clothes
- This?
- No!
- That?
- No!
Perfect!
Now for shoes
Don't know my size
Perfect!
Let that 0Id pain go
Enjoy your inky glow
Groove with our gentle flow
Just be happy
It's been over two hours
Make an effort, fight depression
This is not a torture session
You lool< fabulous, Agatha dear
This'll go down as
Your watershed year
What a beautiful black woman!
Some compliment!
You are a stupid bitch.
Sorry.
Now you're presentable,
go get a job.
Move your ass!
And keep in touch!
Miss Cléry?
No, that's me.
Delighted to meet you.
Jean-Charles Lajoignie.
This way, please.
Fine track record, good diplomas.
I sae you're Sagittarius,
like my mother!
No, really...
And you're available? Sure?
I'm sorry, the woman
who was due for maternity laava...
Is staying on.
She's not taking maternity leave?
No. It's such a pity.
Sophie? Agatha Cléry to see you.
I'm coming.
Hello.
Agatha Cléry, nice to meet you.
Sophie Valois.
Do come in.
Sit down.
Lool<, I'm in a bit 0fa spot...
I don't know what happened,
obviously the information
didn't circulate...
The job's been taken.
How about that.
You have an excellent CV.
But I've had to bow down
to the boss's candidate.
Divine right, you know.
I don't believe a word
of your story.
I've trotted it out too often.
I'm not racist,
the problem is 0ur clients.
No, absolutely not!
Or you'll call me a week later
to say you've taken on someone else
but my colour isn't an issueu.
as she's coloured too!
Or stand me up
for an important meeting.
Or feel unwell.
No really, you're quite wrong...
I was white too.
Good bye.
Stupid bitch.
What happened?
She's mad.
Not the right career profile,
Sorry, job taken,
Not the right profile,
Thank you, Miss Cléry.
Good luck!
Don't exaggerate, it's not
always because you're black.
In SOI'T1€ CBSGS YOU may not
have the right skills.
You know many people
as unskilled as me?
Who handled Scandinav?
Who was made marketing director?
Believe me, it's racism!
You're not going out like that?
- Not everyone is racist.
- They are!
- No! I'm not.
- Come 0ff it!
Maybe I was a tiny bit
but not any more.
Yes, I'm your token black.
For your WASP conscience.
And because you knew me before.
I don't know what I hate most.
People pitying me or despising me.
OK. Shall we go?
I can't take it any more.
It'll work out. Don't lose hope.
Don't talk about hope.
Cioran said:
Hope is a virtue for slaves.
I don't know if I'm racist
but you're a pain!
Your My people have
suffered enough attitude
is getting unbearable.
Am I like that?
A bit.
A bit or a lot?
A bit of a lot.
See, you are racist.
Let's go.
It's too crowded. Let's go home.
Don't move.
- I don't feel like dancing.
- Liar.
Anyway he won't let me in.
Don't talk crap.
He'll let you in, he's black.
That's why he's outside.
You're out of date.
Clubs don't turn black people away.
You're being na'l've.
Arabs maybe. But not blacks.
Sure they do.
Let them through, please.
How long have they
been together? Tell me!
She tool< out an option the day
you said he didn't touch you.
What a bitch!
That's ages ago.
And you never told me.
Come on!
The bitch!
Don't lool< so grim.
White people get cheated on too.
You'll make yourself ill.
I warned you.
Shall I come with you?
Wow! I never knew
you could dance like that.
It's normal.
I got rhythm in my blood.
Hello?
Did I wake you?
I knew it! Seen the time?
Shit!
I said don't drink too much.
Who wanted to go out?
You didn't have
to drink like a fish!
If I hadn't gone out
I wouldn't have seen those two.
OK, it's my fault.
Get a move on!
Why? I'll 0nly get turned down.
There's no point going.
So don't go.
, hUl'l'Y Up.
Hello. I have an appointment
with Mr Lambert.
He's not here.
Thanks. Bye.
Wait! Who are you?
What's that to you?
Agatha Cléry.
Isa? Miss Cléry is
at reception for Quentin.
Alright.
Left, than through
the 0pan plan area.
Mr Salaoui's assistant
will meet you.
Turn left...
I got it. Thanks.
Miss Cléry?
I'm Isabelle Plesh,
Mr Salaoui's PA.
- Who's Mr Salaoui?
- The IVID.
He's number 2,
Quentin Lambert is president.
Kader, your appointment.
- Hello.
- Hello. Do sit down.
Would you like coffee? Tea?
No, thank you.
- Some water?
- I'm fine, thanks.
Right. I'll make it brief.
We're an IT service company,
specializing
in intranet/extranet,
the whole net thing.
We provide site creation, advice,
we're developing programmes
for 3G phones, 4G,
So we're lool<ing
for a marketing director.
You were in cosmetics,
then you resigned?
No, I didn't exactly resign,
we parted by mutual agreement.
Why?
I felt I'd gone
as far as I could go.
And although
they appreciated my worl<...
They were up for a new face.
Been job hunting for long?
Too long.
Had a lot of hits?
No. A lot of rejections.
Why?
Why do you think?
I don't know.
Maybe you weren't suitable?
That's for sure.
But my qualifications
wererft the issue.
- What was?
- My new...
Sorry. My colour.
WSIVS 8 YOUFIQ COITIDBFIY.
Quentin Lambert started it.
He's like you: loads of diplomas,
Ioads of rejections.
Because he's black.
So he came to a logical conclusion.
We live in a society that's always
been run by and for white people.
So he decided to create
this company to promote,
help and employ everyone else.
And wa'ra increasing daily.
No white people?
None. Zero. But don't worry.
We function the same,
with the same markets and targets.
But since they don't want us,
we don't want them.
- Do you mind?
- Not a bit.
On the contrary. I'm not bothered.
Nor are we.
But we don't want them.
You're right. Me neither.
When can you start?
You see? Never lose hope!
You know why I got the job?
Because you're black?
Right on the money!
Positive discrimination?
In this case,
negative discrimination.
What do you mean?
They won't hire anyone who's white.
No?
- Like I said.
- No white people?
No.
What do they do?
Internet/intranet operations
for various companies.
Not one white person?
No.
And they function?
Just asking.
They doubled their turnover.
Fair enough.
Are you up for it?
Sure I'm up for it.
Pray they don't find out
I'm not really black.
You have a point!
Miss Cléryl
This gentleman wanted
to ask me about you.
I didn't say a word!
I'm Mr Flin, Mr Ozares' attorney.
My client informed me
you have undergone a...
Genetic transformation?
Nothing genetic about it.
But physically...
You've changed radically?
What of it?
If the guarantees
you offered Mr Ozares
were sound enough at the time
for him to lat his apartment to you,
what is the situation today,
now you're someone else?
What is the question exactly?
Since you're no longer the same,
the question we ask is whether...
Your lease is renewable?
Go ask yourself that question.
Come back when I've barbequed
a sheep after an excision!
That was 0na of my cliant's fears.
Any more shit and I'll eat him raw.
And you too!
I need a report on their products
and a rundown of the competition.
And in case
they try to beat us to it,
I'd like to be ready by next month.
Can I have something...
Let's say Thursday?
- Wednesday if you like.
- Great.
- Excuse me.
- No problem.
We've finished.
- Coming for lunch?
- Right away.
Here's the blurb on video functions
and high speed link ups.
Good.
We'll get there, you'll see.
Move your black ass, bitch.
- Think that's funny?
- Yes.
- Well?
- Well what?
How's things with your darkies?
- Bad.
- C'mon!
Anti-white racial discrimination
in France today is a scandal.
Hand in your notice.
No, but I haven't said my last word.
Not more of your crap. Chillout.
What's the movie?
A classic, you'll like it.
Guess who's coming to dinner?
Social life:
the rise you expect
is a long way 0ff.
Heart: the desert crossing
has just begun.
A load of bullshit.
- So why did you ask me to read it?
- I didn't.
- Hello, Mr Lambert!
- Hello.
Gemini. Social life:
you'll send out sparks.
Heart: love at first sight
is close at hand.
So's your dismissal
if you don't answer that.
- How did it go?
- Good, thanks.
- Jetlagged?
- Slept on the plane.
- How's New Delhi?
- Magnificent.
The Indians not too tricksy?
No more than you!
- Hi, Quentin.
- Hi. Work, work!
Hey, Quentin!
Quentin, meet Agatha Cléry,
Agathe, meet Quentin Lambert,
your boss.
Good to meet you.
They read it to me,
but I didn't believe it.
Me neither,
but it was written.
Love at first sight!
A kiss.
- I can't get over it!
- Over what?
Over what?
If I'd heard it six months ago:
you black
and in love with a black guy!
I've never been so happy.
- What?
- Nothing.
You should tidy up this mess.
Do they have huge 0nes?
So that's it!
- Everyone says they do.
- I don't know.
I haven't sean that many.
Compared to Herve for instance?
It takes two.
And we fuck fantastically.
Fantastically better than Hervé?
No comparison. With Hervé
it was hygienic. This is magic.
Because it's bigger?
It hits the spot. Satisfied?
Find one for yourself, any size,
and stop fantasizing.
When I see lovers like them
My heart skips a beat
But we're too 0Id
For that sexy treat
It's sooner than you suppose
The menopause
They're cute
We'd follow suite
But we're too busy
To have a fiancé
We strut the catwalk daily
And time flies gaily
Flies past too fast
Too fast
She's a lot more relaxed
Than when we saw har around
But now
She's the prettiest lassie
From Normandy
In Paris town
Fill a bottle change a nappy
At the créche the kids are happy
But when they catch a nasty cold
Home they come as good as gold
Bye bye ba by
Mum's 0ff to work
There's nowhere to sit
There are beds for fornicating
It's no good for anyone
To witness all this mating
How oId was she
when we adopted her?
Let's say six months.
And why a black baby?
That's what life offered
and we were overjoyed.
And why did we adopt?
We were sterile.
You were sterile.
Alright.
Can you manage?
What? It's all Greek to me.
I can't help you.
Dad, mum, this is Quentin.
- Roland Cléry, good to meet you.
- Hello.
Mimi. I'm delighted.
Darling!
Hi, honey-bunch. Had a good trip?
Excellent.
What's Before the Eure
you're cutting it fine?
That's the county council.
It's funny.
- You think so?
- Yes.
You don't find
the colour code meaningless?
Back off.
- Need a hand?
- It's fine.
Come on in.
Did you clean up the house?
Of course, don't worry.
Was that at school?
You were so cute.
Yeah?
Wasn't she!
I love school photos. Got any more?
Really?
The one and only.
How come?
This young lady was
the only black child in class.
So she systematically
refused to be in the annual photo.
We did our best to explain
that it was normal,
she'd been adopted.
But it was hopeless.
She's a stubborn little thing!
Right, honey-bunch?
- Any more?
- Any more what?
- Photos of Agatha.
- Sure!
Birthdays, holidays, lots!
Can I see them?
No.
I'd love to show you them but...
They've all been tidied away.
Dad's always been shambolic.
Not exactly ideal for an ironmonger!
Luckily I have a very tidy wife.
They always say oppositas attract.
Come and see the house.
Your parents are nice.
For white people.
Not a word against my parents.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hello, Thomas.
- How old are you, Thomas?
-6.
Were you white too?
Agathe was white before.
Really?
Kids have such vivid imaginations!
What they think up!
Are you sick too?
No, I'm not sick.
Me neither.
So why are you black?
Run along. We'ra having a rest.
- Why are you white?
- I was born white.
And I was born black.
But Agathe used to be white.
Agatha, you were white.
Who's been talking nonsense?
But I saw you!
- You didn't!
-I did!
ou didn't!
Camille!
OK, OK, I was white.
Why do you tell him
stuff like that?
Camille!
It's a game.
Go play with your sister.
Telling a kid we're black
because we're sick is not a game!
Camille!
What?
Was Agathe white before?
Yes! She had an illness,
it turned her black!
You see?
No way!
She's black with white parents,
but she's not sick.
- She is!
- No, really.
Know what adoption is?
Justine in my class was adopted,
she's Vietnamese.
- There!
- I'm the same.
No, dad said you had an illness.
OK then.
No, it's not OK!
Dad!
Don't bother your father!
Ask him.
You'll see Agatha isn't sick.
Dad!
Don't shout! What is it?
Wasn't Agathe white before?
No! We've told you umpteen times
she was adopted!
You see?
Thanks a lot.
No problem.
The group leader CVs
that Agatha chose.
- What's going on?
- What?
What's this?
OK, he's blond. So what?
He's white!
He has the best CV of the three.
That's the bottom line, right?
Are you taking the piss?
How do you mean?
We have a basic postulate here.
Only one : No Whites.
I know. But it's stupid.
As stupid as No Blacks or No Arabs.
Maybe. That's how it is.
Why not say no one under 6 foot?
Or no nudists?
No one who was born on Thursday?
You know why
I started this company.
Yes. You don't want whites.
Right.
You know what made me do it?
No.
A bitch told her HR director
I wanted 500 euros more
than the other guy.
Just because I was black.
Isn't that vile?
Yes.
Where was it?
At the Guinards'.
That day I swore I'd never
be dependent on white whims.
When that stuff stops
I'll think again.
But right now,
I want no whites in this company.
OK?
If you say so.
You're bizarre!
Bizarre, you're bizarre
I'm not bizarre
I'm up shit creek
You certainly are!
Keep my mouth shut
And don't talk
Or speak and watch him
Take a walk
You've cast the die
You've got to lie
If you own up
You'll screw it up
Why must it all
Fall apart?
Make me sad
And break my heart?
It was so beautiful
It was so fine
Say nothing
And keep Quentin
She's right say nothing
You'd regret it
You'd never forget it
True love
Is so precious
Just enjoy it
It's delicious
I don't want
To see him go
That's the way
So go with the flow
Okay, 0kay
I'll go with the flow
That's what I'm trying to say
That's what she's trying to say
Trying to say
Trying to say
That's what she's trying to say
Mmm, yes...
Yes, there, that's so good...
Go on, more!
Right, time to get up.
- Want the bathroom?
- After you.
Hey!
Yes?
I've been thinking...
I'll give you a key,
it's more practical.
There's no ulterior motive,
it's not an official demand...
Agatha?
Did you hear what I said?
Yes. It's more practical.
What's more practical?
I don't know.
Say it again?
I want to give you my keys.
Sweetheart!
Completely out of it!
Increased your cortisone?
No.
Started another treatment?
- What is it?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
But if your ACTH level
keeps falling...
Well?
You won't need any medication.
But I thought it was incurable!
Apparently not.
I'll be cured?
It looks like it.
I'll be white again?
I don't want to be.
My job is never boring.
- I've built myself a new life.
- I see.
But it's rare to hear someone
complaining about being cured.
I don't want this.
I don't want to be white again!
I can't be!
Inoculate me with the virus?
Miss Cléry, it isn't a virus.
You know what I mean!
I'll be white again?
It's inevitable.
Agatha?
Darling!
Have you seen Agatha?
No.
She called to say she's sick.
With what?
I don't know.
Don't you know?
No.
- Haven't you seen her?
- Sure.
You had a row.
They had a row.
Agatha, it's Quentin.
I woke up without you.
Kader says you're sick.
I don't understand.
Call me,
tell me what's going on.
Lots of love.
Agatha, it's Quentin.
Explain why you won't talk to ma.
Call me, I love you.
Shit!
Lots of love.
Phoning at the wheel
is illegal in France.
Your ID.
This classy car yours?
Driving license,
insurance and registration,
please.
She doesn't want any lunch?
No.
Agatha, it's me again.
I don't know what I did
to make you vanish.
But it's pathetic,
it pisses me off!
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.
If you think I'm moving too fast
I'll take my keys back, no problem.
But I won't hire someone white.
That's definite.
But whatever it is,
please call me!
Agatha, it's me again.
Don't want your orange juice?
No.
I'm taking your car, dad.
Dad!
Hi, girls.
What happened to you?
I'll call you back.
Agatha?
You hired someone white.
And slept with her.
No, but you're...
I'm white, Quentin.
I was born white.
I turned black because I was ill.
Now I'm cured.
No, it's...
- It's not possible.
- It is.
And the white bitch
at the Guinards'...
Was me!
No, it's...
I love you, Quentin.
Black or white, I love you.
You can't deal with it?
No whites in this company, ever?
It's so sad.
You both seemed so happy.
- No news?
- No.
Call him.
What's the point?
If he doesn't change his mind
good riddance, he's just a dickhead.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
Look for a job.
And deal with a couple of things.
Miss Cléry?
Mr Thiédot, my lawyer.
Joélle Segbent, my best friend.
- Sorry!
- No, my fault.
- Miss...
- Hello!
I'd like your advice
on Agathe's replacement.
Good morning.
I have an appointment with
Mr Guinard, Guinard & Guinard.
- Who shall I say?
- Mr Thiénot.
In accordance with article 225-2
of the penal code,
and article L122-144
of the code of ethics,
my client files a complaint
for unjustified dismissal
and racial discrimination.
Kindly inform me of the name
of your defending lawyer.
Good day.
What do we do, dad?
We're in deep shit.
Attagirl, Agatha!
Hiya!
Is Hervé in?
Hervé!
What are you doing?
I'm back!
We said wa'd gat back togathar
as soon as I was white.
I am now!
So we're together.
I missed you, Herve darling.
Didn't he tell you?
No.
Naughty boy!
That's not nice,
you should have told her.
Don't worry about picking up
your stuff. No rush.
So long, asshole.
White wanted
to work in coloured company
and love the boss
who can't live without her.
Well done!
Out of the way!
