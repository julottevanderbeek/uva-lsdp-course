'The prosecution counsel has
proved that Ravi Verma's..

Verma is the actual owner..'
..of Stalinbosch Wine Estate.'
'This court disapproves
Sir Juda's claim and..'
..asks Ravi Verma to file the
property papers in court..
..till the 20th of this month.'
''
Kamini, we won the case!''
''
Kamini, we won the case!''
''
l'm so happy for you, darling!''
You would be happy tomorrow!
''Remember, l had told you that
the day we win the case.. - Yes!''
The very next day
we would get married!
''Guess what baby,
we are getting married tomorrow!''
''''''l'll lose myself..''''
- l love you, my baby!''
''
''''l'll lose myself..''''''
''Sir Juda, please, give
me one more chance.''
We will appeal to the High Court.
l'll win the case for you.
''
l'll fight your case for free, sir.''
l'll even return the money
that l took from you.
''
Sir, please! Sir..''
Sir Juda says he doesn't allow
anybody to work for free.
He doesn't take back money
once it's given to someone.
''Goodbye, Mr. Sanjh.
- Please, Sir Juda..''
Give me one more chance..
Give me one more chance
to prove myself.
''Okay, congratulations,
now you're husband and wife.''
Congratulations! - Thank you.
Thank you very much. - Okay.
''Thank you. - Kamini Verma. Hello,
Mrs. Verma. - Yes, Mr. Verma!''
''
Hi, mom. l'm calling from Cape Town.''
''
Guess what, mom?! We won the case!''
''Really. - You know, Mr. Juda tried
his best to bribe them..''
''..but nothing came out of it
and now, all the property..''
..will be ours.
'God always helps an honest man.'
'''l'm very happy for
your success, dear.'''
This is all due to the blessings
of Mother Goddess.
l'm making a temple for
Her on your behalf.
'When are you coming back?'
We are coming tomorrow.
- We?
There's someone else with you too?
lt's a big surprise for you!
''You might be a bit angry
at first, but l'm sure..''
..you'll be very happy later!
What kind of surprise is it?
''lt won't remain a surprise
if l tell you, right?''
l want to talk to brother.
''Talk to Pinky.
- Yes, mom.''
''Pinky!
- Hello, brother.''
''So how are you, my sweet, innocent,
little foolish sister?!''
''
Brother, are you drunk?''
Not at all.
- Don't lie!
Elders say alcohol destroys families.
''Listen, l'm having just one beer.
lt doesn't harm anyone.''
''
And listen, don't tell mom.''
''Brother, l'm very angry. Why didn't
you call for so many days?''
l'll tell you tomorrow when l return.
You want something from here?
You come soon. We want nothing else.
''
Okay, brother. See you tomorrow!''
l love you! Bye!
l love you too!
''
Priest, has the idol been placed?''
''
All the rituals are completed, Mother.''
Only the sacred vessel
remains to be kept.
Then you can start the veneration
in the temple.
Find an auspicious time tomorrow.
My son is coming tomorrow.
l'm making this temple on his behalf.
He will place the sacred vessel
in the temple himself. - Okay.
Wow! lt's a beautiful tune!
Who's made it?
A guy named John who
works in our estate.
He hums this tune every morning.
l've been hearing it since childhood.
Now it feels like it won't be morning
if John doesn't play this tune.
l love it! lt's really beautiful!
''Hi, John!
- Hello, sir!''
''Sorry sir, l didn't notice you
as l was busy with my tune.''
lt's alright. How
are you? All's well?
''
Yes, everything's alright, sir.''
How are you?
- Fantastic!
''John, she's my wife, Kamini.
Kamini, he's John.''
''Hello. - Hello, ma'am! l wish
you a very happy married life.''
''Thank you.
- Thank you, John!''
''
Thank you! See you around, sir!''
''
C'mon, sweetheart. Don't be scared.''
Here we go.
Okay then you're set!
''You know, Kamini, the properties
l showed you..''
..while driving are all ours.
We have some of the best
vineyards in the world.
We make some of the best wines.
''And sweetheart, since you've
come into my life..''
..l seem to be doing well.
You are the best!
Okay then..
''So baby, are you ready for
the flight of your life?!''
''Yes, l am.
- That's good!''
And up we go!
Successful take off.
''Hey Kamini, look down.
That's our brewery.''
And adjacent to it is
our seeding plant.
''Wow!
- Lovely, isn't it?''
''And in a while, you'll come across
Mother Kali's temple.''
My mother is building it for me.
''
Why are you so quiet, sweetheart?''
Don't be tensed. l'm a fantastic
pilot. l'm safe.
You must be thinking about how my
mom will react when she sees you.
Find out once we reach home!
She will love you a lot.
''Daughter-in-law, sit here.
Daughter-in-law, sit there.''
''Daughter-in-law, don't
sit near the AC!''
Daughter-in-law is suffering
from cold!
Call the doctor immediately!
She isn't aware that the
daughter-in-law's..
..do not like interference
these days! lsn't it?
Oh! What happened to this?
Oh..
The fuel..
''Kamini, wear the parachute
behind your seat.''
l've already worn the parachute.
- Good.
Oh no. We're losing
height very fast..
''Kamini, don't worry,
nothing will happen.''
l'll not let anything happen to you.
''Kamini, there's one more
parachute behind my seat.''
Hand it to me quickly.
Your parachute is lying
exactly where l threw it.
''What kind of ajoke
is this, Kamini?!''
Where's the parachute?!
Oh no!
Don't waste more time on this.
When you were checking
the safe in the alder..
..l disabled the fuel gauge.
The plane is about to crash soon.
- What?!
''l'll miss you, my love.
- Kamini! Kamini!''
There was just one parachute
in the plane..
..and Ravi sacrificed himself
while trying to save me.
l saw my husband dying and
l couldn't do anything.
l couldn't do anything..
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
No. This can't happen.
Such injustice can't happen.
You can't go leaving me behind.
You promised me that
you would come back.
''But not this way. Not this way,
my son! Not this way..''
''No! No, l won't let you go!
- Brother! Brother!''
l'll go with you! Leave me! Leave me!
l want to go with him. Leave me!
''l ask you, why did you take
my son away from me?!''
Didn't you feel anything
when watching him die?
lf you are a mother.. so am l!
You'll have to return my son to me!
Ravi will have to come back!
To this very place! This
very temple! To me!
Or else you will have to go through..

Congratulations, Mr. Oberoi!''
Today Monty was just wonderful!
''Not Monty,
Mr. l-don't-know-your-name!''
l was wonderful!
Who discovered him? Me!
''Who presented him before the
audience? - Mr. Oberoi, you!''
Yes! l'm the maker! G.G. Oberoi!
The star maker!
''
A quote please, sir..''
Dayal.. you.
- Where's your cap?!
Yes.
l made Monty! Ask me why.
- Why?
Because l'm the maker. l made him.
''lf l wouldn't be there,
Monty would have..''
..been performing
in some shoddy bar.
But that didn't happen. Ask why.
- Why?
Because l'm the maker!
l'm the star maker!
The man with vision!
''
Look, here he comes!''
Ask him! Confirm!
''
Monty, is he your friend?''
''
Yes dad, he's my friend Dr. Dayal.''
''
Hi! Good evening, uncle!''
ls he the one who..
- He's an orphan. lt doesn't matter.
lt matters to me!
''Good evening, ma'am.
- Mr. Phillips!''
Monty is my son. My son.
My sweet son.
''Monty, are you hurt
by what he said?!''
You know how he is after he drinks!
He reaches Jalandhar when
he's not in his senses!
''Started again.
- Hey. Come on, leave that!''
''lt's too much! Too much! Come on,
Let's go. - Just a little..''
l belong to lakhs of people
but no one belongs to me.
lf l can say someone
belongs to me then its Mrs. Oberoi.
''l have everything!
Name, fame, money!''
The only thing that
l don't have is my mother.
l don't even know what a
mother or her love is.
''
Dayal, if l had my mother with me..''
..l would give up everything for her.
''Monty, my friend, l've known
you for a long time..''
..but for the first time l've felt
the pain you are going through.
''
Come on, Monty! Life has to go on.''
''Come on! l know this keeps happening,
but Monty, you're a rock star!''
You can do better!
''Monty, smile once! You laughed!
Laughed! Laughed!''
Will you do a favour for me?
What is it?
''You know my boss, Dr. Daniel.
He's hosting a party..''
..tomorrow at Monsoon Lagoon
and if you come there then..
What's happening? Keep those
champagne glasses..
..along with those
champagne bottles!
''Come on, this is our
last examination!''
''We have to rock this party!
Girls, hurry up!''
lf you don't score well
this year then..
..you'll have to listen to what
that boring principal says.
''Girls, what's wrong with you all?
Why are you all staring at me?''
''Not you, l'm looking at
Monty, the rock star!''
Look! Right in front of you.
''lmpossible! Rock-star Monty
and that too, all alone!''
Let me check it out.
''Excuse me, is Dr. Daniel hosting
his party in this club?''
He's a duplicate..
- Excuse me!
Do you just look like Monty
or do you sing like him too?
''Look, l'm asking you about Dr.
Daniels' party and its location.''
''
The party's here, but it's at 8:30.''
''Yes, it's 8:30 right now. - Your
watch is a fake. Just like you!''
What's your name?
Monty. - So you feigned the
name along with his get-up!
God gave me a face similar
to him and l got..
..a lot of suggestions to keep
Monty as my name and l kept it.
You aren't ashamed of
taking advantage..
..of someone's fame and success?
l do feel ashamed but considering
my problems..
..l keep quiet.
lt's my bad luck to roam
around as his duplicate.
Had l got the break
at the right time..
..Monty would have
been my duplicate..
..and would be standing here.
You couldn't have been Monty
even with ten breaks!
You seem to be a big fan of his!
Have you ever met him?
l've seen a lot of his
shows on the T.V.
''Oh, you haven't met him, he's
so arrogant, egoistic..''
''Had you met him once,
you would have been..''
''
..not his, but a fan of mine.''
''Hey duplicate, l don't
want to talk to you!''
And you shouldn't too! Good
girls don't act that way too.
Will you please shut up?!
There's still some time
for the party to begin.
You can either wait here
or get lost! Duplicate!
''
Monty, sing a song!''
''Okay! Okay! Calm down. Calm down!
- Oh no! - Monty, sing a song for us!''
''
Coming to the point, guys..''
..Monty's under a contract
with Mr. G.G. Oberoi.
Hence he cannot sing at a private
party or a function.
Or else he'll have to pay his legal..
''No. Monty, please sing a song
for us! Please! Please!''
''
Please Monty, sing a song for us!''
What do l do now?
Pack your bags. Regret later.
''Okay, if you all insist,
l'll play an instrument for you.''
''
''''God! Oh God!''''''

''Hello. One second, one second.
Hi. Can you move please?''
Excuse me. - One at a time please.
- Excuse me. - One at a time..
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Later. - Please sir..
After 15 minutes.
- Did you find out anything? - Yes.
Forget her. She was here for
some practical assignment..
..from some catering
college in Kenya..
lt was her last day today in
Cape Town. Her flight's at 11:30.
What time is it? She's left.
Monty! What madness?!
Even after l refused!
Why did you sing? l'm the maker!
You can't insult me!
''l haven't, dad.
- Don't call me dad!''
''
l'm not your dad, l own you!''
Don't fail to remember that
l have put my money on you!
''Money! Money! Money! Can't you
think of anything else, dad?''
''
And you might need money, not me!''
l've signed just a contract
with you. Not my freedom!
Look..
lf you try to pressurise me..
..l'll leave this house
as well as the contract.
Monty! Monty!
- Look at him! He's insulting me!
What happened?
He's begun to take his own
decisions these days!
Come here. Why don't you leave
your foolishness! - Foolishness?
He's very profitable to us.
lf he finds out the truth then..
..even my fake love won't be
able to make him stay here.
Understand?!
Silly man from Jalandhar!
''
Hi, handsome!''
''
Oh, hi Julie.''
Looks like you're thinking
about something serious.
l'm trying to write a
story for my next show.
l can't seem to get it.
You sang such a wonderful song
the other day at the party.
My friends couldn't stop
talking about it!
''Look, here are a few
snaps of that party.''
Thanks. - You know..
My friends said that you
couldn't have sung..
''..such a wonderful song,
had l not inspired you!''
''After all, there has to
be some inspiration..''
''
..to write and sing a song, right?''
''You're right, Julie. Assuming
that l've got my inspiration..''
Monty!
Monty!
''
''''l'm immersed in your love..''''''
''''''l'm immersed in your love,
night and day.''''''
''
''''Praise the Lord!''''''

the one who gives me peace.''''''

''Monty! - Once more! Once more!
Monty, you are a rock star!''
''
'Monty! l love you, my baby!'''
'''l love you! l'm so happy
for you, darling!'''
''Monty, try and concentrate
on the visuals now, okay?''
You've seen an aircraft crash.
There was a girl in it.
Do you know her?
Have you seen that palace
in your past..
..in your childhood or in any movie?
Then how can such images
or visuals come to you?
''Last night, when l was
playing my guitar..''
''Okay, fine. Nurse, could we
have the guitar here, please?''
Sure.
''
Monty, play those same notes again.''
''
'l love you, my baby!'''
'''l love you! l'm so happy
for you, darling!'''
This time l saw something else too.
A temple. There's an idol of
Goddess Kali in that temple.
l saw that girl once again.
She was hugging someone.
''Dr. Dayal, the visuals Monty
saw have no relation to him.''
lt could be that this is something
related to his past birth.
''Sir, you talk about rebirth
in this birth! Reincarnation!''
''
Dr. Shastri, you are really orthodox.''
You don't seem to believe me.
l've practiced this for ten
years in a village in lndia.
A five-year-old child
used to recite chants..
..from Ramayan and
Geeta in Sanskrit.
And he even knew about his
parents and his house..
..from his previous birth.
''Even l didn't believe it then,
just like you don't believe me now.''
But l was stunned when
this was proved true.
''Forget these old things, sir.
lt's a simple case of psychosis.''
''What happened, Monty?
- Oh my God! My son!''
''Are you okay? - l'm the maker.
G.G Oberoi. Tell me, doctor.''
''
Aunt, nothing's wrong with Monty.''
He's just stressed out!
''He requires a month's rest,
that's it.''
Four weekends?! l would be at a loss
if he rests for even a month!
l would incur a huge loss.
''Darling, don't be silly!
Leave your foolishness!''
You think of money all the time!
''Monty, you're going on a
holiday from tomorrow.''
And l'll see who stops you.
''No, mom, no place can soothe
me without my music.''
lt can! One place can soothe you.
And that's Kenya!
- Kenya?
''Kenya, where your songs
are a super-hit!''
''Kenya! Kenya, a girl, Kenya..
- Oh..''
''Okay, if you insist, l'll
surely go to Kenya.''
''
''''Oh God. Oh God.''''''
''
''''Oh God. Oh God.''''''
''
''''Ever since l've seen you..''
''
..l've lost myself.''''''
''
''''Oh God. Oh God.''''''
What happened then?
- He was crazy about me!
He sang the whole song looking at me.
l just couldn't believe it.
Sing further..
- Further..

''Tina, this guardian of yours,
princess Kamini..''
..when is she returning from London?
Why are you waiting for her?
That's because l need her permission.
For what?
''Look, we talk on the phone,
have lunch and dinner..''
..and then go our separate
ways late at night.
''So l was thinking, why don't we
go for a live-in relationship.''
''Live-in relationship?! Are you crazy?
- Don't get hyper, Tina.''
l wanted to meet your guardian
to talk about this.
She'll slap you the moment
she hears this!
''And you'll keep watching? - No,
l'll ask her to slap you again.''
l was born here but l'm
a true lndian at heart.
That means you don't love
me. lt's useless.
We can get married.
- What was l saying all along?
You were talking about
a live-in relationship.
Every relationship after marriage
is a live-in relationship!
And since you've already proposed..
..l might as well talk
to your guardian.
''You'll have to talk to
uncle Kabir, not her.''
Who's uncle Kabir?
He stays at Cape Town and
visits me every weekend.
He's a huge fan of Hindi film songs.
What is it? Who are you?
Hey fool! Forgot who l am?!
l'm Kabira.
- What do you want?
''Shakal, Mogambo, tell me
everything about him.''
Bank of Mambo. Credit
card number 400901.
''
Debit balance, 15000.''
He hasn't paid the E.M.l.
for the last four months.
''
The total amount is 3,000.''
Should l kill you or spare you?
Tell me what l should do.
''My village, my country!
- 1976!''
''Hero, Dharmendar.
- Super-hit!''
''
Kabira, please, spare me..''
Your two lifelines finish now.
l want only cash.
''
Give me a day's time, l'll..''
''l'll give you three minutes,
not a day.''
There's a pawn shop there. Pawn
yourself if the need arises.
Or else Mogambo and
Shakal will kill you.
Go.
''
C'mon, Roxy! Come! Come!''
C'mon!
''
Kabira, your money.''
''What would you have done if it
was 30,000 instead of 3,000?''
Then l would have sold you too!
''
Kabira, you care a lot about Tina.''
Not even real parents care so much.
Tina's no doubt my late friend
Mahesh's daughter..
..but l love her more
than l love my family.
''Oh little one, what kind
of relationships..''
..and emotions are these?
''
A flower, two gardeners! -1968!''
That's right! - Golden jubilee!
- l didn't watch it!
''
One flower, two gardeners!''
Flower! l remembered my
cute little daughters!
''Fun, laughter, smartness..
l cry when l think of them.''
How long will my daughters
remain unmarried?
Everything will be fine.
Have patience.
Patience! Patience! You keep
postponing it by saying this.
Who's Patience? lntroduce me to him.
l'll make him my live-in son-in-law.
Patience! Patience!
''By the way, how about Tina's studies?
- Excellent!''
She's the best cook at our college.
She prepares delicious food!
People drool over it!
''My daughters cook too,
but l am searching..''
..for a guy to eat their food.
Whom do they feed? They
eat it themselves!
Tina's not to be seen. Where is she?
She hasn't come to college today.
She's not been here
for 15 to 20 days.
- But she's a nice girl.
One should keep an eye on girls
at this age. - That's right.
l too keep an eye on my daughters!
But there has to be someone
to keep an eye on..
Whom should l keep an eye
on and what's the use?
''Monty, what if uncle
Kabir rejects you?''
''
lf he does that, we will elope!''
You respect elders all the time
or is this the first time?
''To tell you the truth, l'm doing
it for the first time.''
Trying to impress me?
- No.
l didn't have anybody to care
for me since childhood.
And those who supported me aren't
even worth talking about.
Do you know how the girl
you love leads her life?
l've made her every wish
or desire a reality.
She thinks that money
is of no concern.
Kamal Kapoor had said that in
the film 'Chor Machaye Shor'..
..when Shashi Kapoor goes to talk..
..about his marriage with Mumtaz.
''But here, the situation
is exactly the opposite.''
You're such great rock star
and my daughter is a nobody.
l was confused since morning..
..about the questions
l wanted to ask you.
''Uncle Kabir, the situation
was similar in 'Bobby'..''
..when Rishi Kapoor goes to
talk about his marriage..
..with Dimple Kapadia.
Oh my! That's true! How
did l forget that?!
l've watched Bobby 15 times!
''Why didn't you two remind me?!
- Sorry, sir.''
You too watch a lot of
Hindi films..
..and hence could defeat me!
''Look, son, l've experienced
a lot in life.''
A person's eyes say a lot about him.
l have only one request to make.
This girl doesn't have anyone
except me. Never hurt her.
Promise?
- Yes.
'Congratulations to everyone and
on this joyous occasion..
..do not be misled by my teary eyes.'

Monty!
Monty!
''
What happened, Monty?''
''
What's wrong with him, doctor?''
Stress.. this is very
common these days.
All he needs is rest and
then he'll be fit.
''
Kabira, will you drop me home?''
lf you don't take the
fees then l just might!
''Monty, take rest. Martha, take
care of him. - Yes, sir.''
''
Come, doctor.''
''
Bye, Monty. Bye.''
Sir..
''
Hello, young man.''
Where did you learn this tune?
lt's my own. My inner voice!
Who stays in that palace?
The Verma family used
to live there once.
Now Princess Kamini occupies it.
And this estate?
- lt belongs to Sir Juda.
He's a very famous business tycoon.
lt once belonged to the
Verma family's son..
But he died in a plane crash and
everything was over. Over.
''
'l'm so happy for you, darling!'''
'We are getting married tomorrow!'
''
Guess what, mom? We won the case!''
This is all due to Goddess'
blessings. lt's really beautiful.
Wish you a very happy married life.
''Brother, l'm very angry! Why didn't
you call all these days?!''
l'll tell you tomorrow
when l return.
What happened to you suddenly?
Nothing.
''l'm alright, John.
- John?! How do you know my name?''
''Not just your name,
l know everything now.''
Thanks.
Monty! lt's good that
you met me here!
l was on my way to your house.
Guess what?
There's a huge party at the
palace and you have to come.
l want to introduce you to someone.
- To whom?
Uncle Kabir was the first
step and the person..
..you will meet tonight..
..will be the final authority
to allow us to marry.
''You'll come, won't you?
- Sure.''
Good evening.
Hi! How are you?
Hello. - Hi. Good evening.
She's my guardian who will grant
us the permission to marry.
''

Hi, l'm Kamini.''
Princess Kamini..
''
''''l shall lose my self to repay you.''''''
Monty.
Who doesn't know you..
l'm a fan of yours too.
''
Are you here for a show, Monty?''
No. l'm here on a holiday.
''
Well, then enjoy yourself.''
''Tina, take good care of him.
- l will.''
l'll see you later..
Shall we dance?
Where's Princess Kamini's husband?
He died in an accident
many years ago.
Princess loved him so much
that she didn't remarry.
Doesn't she feel lonely?
That's the least of
her concerns in life
Princess has sorted out her life.
''Saturday nights are spent at
a casino, golf on Monday's..''
..race on Tuesday's.
She keeps herself busy.
''Tina, darling, can l
borrow him from you?''
''After all, such rock stars
don't grace my party everyday.''
''Of course, Princess.
He's all yours.''
''
''''l'll lose myself..''''''
''
''''l'll lose myself..''''''
Casablanca.
- Something different.
''After a long time,
l'm hearing something so good.''
''So, Mr. Monty?
How do you find our Kenya?''
Feels as if l've known
this place for years.
Maybe l share a relationship
from a previous birth.
Come on! No relationship
is that bad.
Relationships can change
after the purpose..
..they were made for is achieved.
''You're quite an interesting
man, Mr. Monty.''
''
You're no less either, Princess.''
Absolutely deadly!
l don't understand anything.
''Forget others, even Kamini
won't believe..''
..the kind of person she met
yesterday at the party.
''He's her husband from her
previous birth, Ravi Verma.''
''You don't need to tell me,
my friend. l believe you.''
l believe everything you say.
- Thanks.
You told me about your mom and
sister from your previous birth..
What about them?
l'll try my best to search
for them tomorrow morning.
This catering college was
built by the Verma family.
But unfortunately they are
nowhere to be found today.
What happened to Ravi Verma's
mom and sister after his death?
''As far as l know, his mom fell
totally silent after that shock.''
''And his sister.. yes, Jyoti! She's
studying in this college itself!''
She's a very nice girl.
My daughters are nice too.
''The three of them. Masti,
Muskaan and Muskurahat.''
l feel like crying the
moment l remember them.
l'm worried about their marriage.
Are you married?
- No.
Come home in the evening.
My daughters cook really well..
They are your fans too!
l was asking about Ravi
Verma's mom and sister.
''Oh! Sorry, l forgot about that.
You know such things happen.''
''Sorry, sorry. - As far as l know,
they have left this city.''
And the only one who can tell
you about them is Mrs. Kamini.
''
Princess, l've never seen you lose.''
Better luck next time.
Place your bets please.
Place your bets.
You shouldn't bet more. You'll lose.
Oh! Good evening.
What do you mean?
- There's a proverb..
''
Unlucky in love, lucky in gambling.''
''And the reverse of that is lucky
in love, unlucky in gambling.''
''Kamini, l can't believe
you lost the bet.''
''
lt's ok, darling.''
You shouldn't bet. You'll lose.
''Mr. Astrologer, mind your
own business please.''
l told you there's an old proverb..
''
Unlucky in love, lucky in gambling.''
''And the reverse of that is lucky
in love, unlucky in gambling.''
You lost because you've found love.
What were you thinking?
''
Princess, you've lost again.''
lt seems like you've found
love again.
''
'What are you thinking, Kamini?'''
'What made you think about
Ravi Verma after so long?'
''
That guy, Monty, is just like him.''
''When l see him, l feel like
it's Ravi l'm looking at.''
Excuse me! - lnsolent man!
Couldn't you knock on the door?
''Sorry, madam, you had forgotten
your mobile there.''
Keep it there! And get out
of the room! Now!
''Yes, ma'am.
- Get out! - Yes, ma'am.''
''Monty, what are you thinking about?
- Nothing.''
''You know, l'm going to
Durban for three days..''
..for a catering assignment.
l thought we would spend
the whole day together..
Have a good time and go
to a casino at night.
''And you're being so quiet?
Tell me, what is it?''
A friend of mine called from
Cape Town last night.
She's got a problem..
- What kind of a problem?
''
Long ago, l knew a couple..''
But they parted ways due
to some misunderstanding.
lt took him a long time to
get over his lost love.
Then another girl came
into his life.
He loved her and promised marriage.
''Then all of a sudden, his
ex came back into his life.''
''Then all of a sudden, his
ex came back into his life.''
What should he do now?
He can't forget his ex..
..and at the same time he
cannot ditch that girl.
He should tell that
new girl everything.
''lf she loves him, she'll allow
him to go to his ex.''
''lf l would have been her,
l would have done that.''
Thanks.
- For?
You solved the problem so easily.
''You're talking as if it's your
problem, not your friend's!''
''Hey, you don't intend
to ditch me? ls it?''
l know you would never ditch me.

Oh my God! Wow!
You're quite amazing!

Alright, we'll have lunch tomorrow.''
Done!

l won't let you go so easily.
''

''Monty, this was the
best day of my life.''
You're lying.
lf this has been the most beautiful
day of your life..
''..then you would have said,
'We should meet more often.'''
You're quite aggressive.
l like it.
Come on.
''Good afternoon, Princess.
- Hello, Kabira.''
How are you?
- l was alright sometime back.
But today l feel a little low.
''Take care of yourself, Kabira.
- Thank you.''
''Bye, Monty.
- Bye.''
Seems like you two have
become good friends..
..in just a couple of days.
''Yesterday a casino, today a
racecourse and then lunch.''
''Make sure you guys don't reach
the dinner table, my friend.''
''
What are you saying, uncle Kabir?''
Our meeting yesterday
was just a coincidence.
l am talking about what l saw.
l'll take your leave.

One could learn how to get angry
with you despite your love.
You're half an hour late.
Sorry.
Sorry.
''lf this is the way you apologise,
l don't mind it if you're late.''
This is for you.
What's this?
- Open it. Ok.
''
Oh my God! lt's beautiful, Ravi.''
There was no need to buy me
such an expensive gift..
..without any occasion.
There couldn't be a better
occasion than our wedding.

What have you thought? - l haven't
thought about it. l've decided.
l'll confess my love
to Kamini tomorrow.
l'm going to tell her
that l love her.
''l trust you, Monty, but make sure
you know what you're doing.''
What happened? Why did
you stop the car here?
To spend some time with you.
Why are you looking at me like that?
''
You love Tina, Monty.''
Why are you trying
to get close to me?
''l understood what love is
when l met you, Kamini.''
l misunderstood Tina's
friendship to be love.
This started off as fun but
now it's getting serious.
We won't meet henceforth. Goodbye.
There's love in your eyes.
The heart is full of desires.
You gave me everything in love.
There's love in your eyes.
The heart is full of desires.
You gave me everything in love.
l shall give up myself
for your love.
This is very beautiful. You
should get it published.
''Hey, don't make fun of me.
l wrote these just like that.''
lt's really very beautiful.
l was hurt by your beauty.
l was hurt by your beauty.
My emotions got swayed.
You gave me everything in love.
l shall give up myself
for your love.
l shall give up myself
for your love.
The one you gave in love.
The one you gave in love.
l shall give up myself for your love.
Who are you?
''My husband, Ravi Verma, had written
the song you just sang.''
How could you sing it?
- lt just came out from within.
What do you want?! What do you want?!
''
l love you, Kamini.''
Are you nuts? There's a huge
age difference between us.
''
For me, you're very beautiful.''
Age and other hazards
of relationships..
..can't stop me from loving you.
The love that could even defy death..
''
Kamini, l'm Ravi Verma.''
Your Ravi Verma.
l had a rebirth because of my
extreme love and your patience.
That's nonsense! l don't believe
in rebirths! You're a liar!
''
What proof do you want, Kamini?!''
You have bed tea before
brushing in the morning.
You get acidity if you don't get
your breakfast before 10am.
You hate those who drink coffee.
You can't tolerate cigarettes
and smokers.
''Come on, Monty! Anybody can
find these things out.''
''Okay, l'll tell you something
that only you..''
''
..or your husband, Ravi Verma, knew.''
You close your eyes while kissing.
On your wedding night..
Would you still say that
l'm not Ravi Verma?
No. Only Ravi Verma can
know these things.
''You don't know how much
l love you, Kamini.''
l remember each and every
moment spent with you.
l remember all our conversations.
The only thing l cannot
recollect is my accident.
l just remember that we were
travelling in the plane together.
Then l remember that the plane
was rushing towards land..
And then the plane
crashed and l died..
Can you tell me how
this accident took place?
''
Tell me, Kamini. Tell me.''
l shudder when l think of that day.
''We were on our way
to meet your, mother.''
Suddenly there was some
problem with the plane.
You told me to wear my parachute.
l had already worn my parachute.
And then you asked me to jump!
When l asked about your parachute..
..you told me that the
plane had just one.
There's one more parachute
behind my seat.
Hand it to me quickly.
l refused to jump.
''
l'll miss you, my love.''
You pushed me out of
the plane by force..
Kamini!
And l saw you dying before me..
l couldn't do anything!
l couldn't do anything!
''Calm down, Kamini.
l'm here because of your love.''
Where is my mom and sister?
Your mom stopped talking
out of shock.
Doctors advised to take
her away from this place..
..so that she could overcome
the shock of your death.
l sent mother and Jyoti to lndia.
But mother died in a few days.
Jyoti got married.
But she and her husband died in
a car accident within a few days.
What was the need to come home?
You could have spent the
night at the palace.
''Uncle Kabir, Tina, l'll explain
everything at the right time.''
What will you explain?
That you love a woman
twice your age?
Didn't you think of Tina even once?
''l've come across many silly people,
but none like you.''
You'd be stunned if l tell you
the truth about that lady..
..for whom you broke up with Tina.
What do you know about Princess?
She's a witch. Not some princess!
She destroyed the Verma family.
She was Ravi Verma's
wife and now she's..
..a concubine of an international
criminal named Sir Juda.
''
How do you know this, uncle Kabir?''
l haven't even told Tina what
l'm going to tell you today.
''Tina's father, Mahesh, worked
as a driver at Kamini's house.''
He was a very good friend of mine.
There was a loud bang
on my door one night..
Kabira! Kabira! Kabira!
- Mahesh!
What happened? Who did this?
''
l'm going to die, Kabira.''
Take care of my daughter.
Tell me who shot you?!
l had been to Kamini's house..
- Yes.
l overheard their conversation.
Mac saw me..
He was the one who shot me..
What were they talking about?
Tell me.
Goddess Kali's temple..
- Goddess Kali's temple?!
Than - Ravi Verma..
Mahesh?!
l didn't inform the police as
l was worried about Tina.
l didn't have much work then..
..so l went to Sir Juda and
Kamini's house the next day.
Oh! So Mahesh told you everything
before his death.
Yes. At Goddess Kali's temple..
- Enough! No need to go further.
How much money do you want?
- We don't deal in such things.
''Because of you, an innocent
girl became an orphan.''
You'll bring her up like
her mother would.
''And yes, if something
happens to us..''
..this secret will be
revealed to the police.
l've made sure this happens.
We brokered this deal but l
still think about the link..
..between Ravi Verma's death
and Goddess Kali's temple.
l'll tell you about it!
''You?
- Yes, Kabira!''
l'm the truth that the world refuses
to believe! That's me!
Think about it. A guy loves
a girl a lot and..
..goes against his religion and
traditions and marries her.
But the girl kills him just
two days into the marriage.
Only for money!
But look at nature's benevolence!
The lover has a rebirth!
''And in his youth, finds out that
the same girl is living..''
..comfortably as some princess!
The temple made by Ravi
Verma still exists.
The college funded by
Ravi Verma exists.
But where's the Verma family?!
Where are my mother and sister?!
Nobody knows anything! Nobody!
''What are you talking about?
- The truth, uncle Kabir!''
This miracle has happened to me.
This happened to me!
l'm not insane to talk this
way. This is the truth.
''So, you are that very
same Ravi Verma..''
Oh God! What kind of
a miracle is this?!
''
Monty, l believe you wholeheartedly..''
..even if nobody else does.
God knows where that lady must
have kept your mom and sister.
That's the reason l acted
as if l loved her.
l've even made her believe that..
..l'm her late husband Ravi Verma.
l told her that l don't
remember how l had died.
l did this to know about
my mom and sister.
And she told me that my mom and
sister are dead! A lie! A lie!
l have a feeling that
they both are alive.
l'm sure they are alive.
''Don't worry, God will certainly
take you to your mom and sister.''
You aren't alone.
We all will help you find them.
''
Let's go, Tina.''
''l'm sorry, Monty,
l misunderstood you.''
''
lts okay, Tina.''
Ravi Verma would be the only
name left after Shantaprasad.
He'll repay what the
Verma family owes.
He'll make them respectable
once again.
''
Brother, you broke the guitar again?''
You haven't learnt guitar
even though you're..
..the elder brother
of a guitar champion!
''Sister, your brother always
does what he intends to do.''
Forget it! You'll have to have
a rebirth to learn guitar! - You!
Kabira is at your behest
and requests..
''..you oh God, unite the one's
who have parted ways.''
''
Unite them, oh God.''
''Martha. - Martha's not come
today, sir. l'm her replacement.''
Get me a glass of water.
''
Tea is ready, sir.''
Just get me ajug of water!
''Sir, one should not drink
alcohol in the morning..''
Shut up and get me water..
Elders say alcohol ruins families.
What's your name?
- Laxmi.
Martha stays near my place.
l came here as she wasn't well.
''
Laxmi? No, your name can't be Laxmi.''
You aren't Laxmi.
- l'm Laxmi. - You can't be Laxmi!
You're Jyoyti! Jyoti!
My name is Laxmi not Jyoti!
l'm Laxmi!
You're lying! You're Jyoti!
- No!
''Please don't address me
that way, sir.''
Then why don't you tell
me that you are..
..Shantaprasad Verma's daughter!
Shantaprasad's dead! So
is the Verma family!
l'm not related to them.
l'm poor and l work
to support my kids.
How are you even related to me?!
Don't hurt me by thinking that
l'm a part of the Verma family.
Pinky..
''Pinky?
- Yes, Pinky.''
''You didn't, but l recognised
you, my sister.''
Sister? You called me sister?
''Yes, Pinky. You're Ravi
Verma's sister, isn't it?''
He used to call you Pinky lovingly.
- Ravi Verma?
How do you know him?
- Because l am..
''
l mean, l'm Ravi Verma's friend.''
''No, l mean, my father used to be
a friend of his at Cape Town.''
Cape Town? Brother used
to go there frequently.
l have your family photograph
in my house.
Father told me to enquire
about the Verma family..
..whenever l visit Cape Town.
''He too tried his best to search
you all, but couldn't succeed.''
''
We don't exist now, sir.''
We faced a lot of hardships
after brother's death.
We are two dead bodies.
Me and my mother.
Mom? Where's she? How's she?
''Please, take me to her.
l want to meet her now!''
''lt's no use, sir.
She's in a sorry state.''
Brother died years ago but she
still can't hear or talk to anyone.
''
'Hey, return my pencil to me!'''
'l didn't take your pencil!'
- 'Don't lie!'
'You took my new pencil!'
''Granny, Raju isn't returning
my pencil to me!''
Don't tell her she
can't hear or talk.
She keeps gazing at brother's
photograph everyday.
She never sleeps.
''
You've come, son..''
''Mom.
- Mummy.. - Mummy, Raju doesn't..''
Yes.
''You must be very tired,
isn't it dear?''
''
Pinky, look. Ravi's come!''
l knew you would be late
but you would surely come.
Tell me. Why don't you talk?
''
You're my Ravi, isn't it?''
''
Yes. Yes, you're my Ravi.''
My dear son!
''Mother, have a seat.
He's not your Ravi.''
''No..
- Mom, you aren't feeling well. Come.''
No! He's my son Ravi!
He's my son Ravi!
God can deceive everybody
but not a mother.
''He's my son. - He's not your son,
mom. He's someone else!''
No.. he's my son Ravi.
Please leave her alone. - But..
- l told you all to let her be.
Mother!
''Mom..
- You're my Ravi, aren't you?''
''
Yes, mom. l'm your son Ravi.''
''
Nobody recognised me, but you did.''
My son recognised me!
He recognised his mother!
''Mom, you'll have to
listen to me now..''
''Yes. - Take rest now.
- Yes, now l'll rest.''
l'll sleep peacefully
now that you're here.
Come.
''Now that you've come,
l'll sleep peacefully.''
''
Mom, who's he?''
''
Come here, dear. l'm your uncle.''
''Henceforth, you all
will stay with me.''
''Great. Oh God, you hurt
and you heal too.''
''
Dear, he's your brother Ravi.''
A miracle of God.
''Monty, you carry out your work.
l'll look after them.''
Sir Juda made me an offer
after your death.
lf l do not claim the property..
..he will pay me 5 lakhs
every month.
Only you knew about
the property papers.
Mother wasn't well and l had
to send her to lndia too..
Therefore l accepted
Sir Juda's offer.
People even passed comments
that l am Sir Juda's keep.
But l tolerated everything for
mother and Jyoti's sake.
''Kamini, you've sacrificed
a lot for my family,''
''And now, Sir Juda will
have to pay for it.''
''Come, l'll tell you where
the property papers are.''
''But Monty, there's a wall here!
- Just come with me.''
Oh my God!
Here are the property papers.
File them in court on my behalf.
Court?!
- Why?!
''l want to fulfill my mother's
dream, Kamini.''
Sir Juda's a dangerous man.
He can do anything!
''He can't. Tell me, are
you with me on this?''
Yes. l love you.
''l love you too, Kamini.
l love you too.''
What nonsense are you talking
about?! Rebirths!
''
lt's true, sir.''
l've seen him taking out the
property papers from the safe.
She's about to file a
court case against you.
Sir Juda says you should keep a
close eye on Kamini from now on.
Okay.
''lf what you say turns out to
be true, you'll be rich soon.''
''
Thank you, Sir Juda.''
''
You're right, Sir Juda.''
Kamini has revolted against
us on Monty's insistence.
''lf Monty dies, so will
Kamini's resilience.''
''May l come in, Princess?
- Yes, Tina.''
''l want to talk to you about
something, Princess. - Yes.''
Monty has told me everything.
lt seems he's made just for you.
l cannot interfere with a person
who's just come back..
..from the brink of death.
l won't mind it if you marry Monty.
''Tina, you've relieved
me from my troubles!''
l'll never forget this act of yours.
''Tina - Now you don't have a reason
not to marry, right?''
No.
lt's Ravi's death anniversary
in three days.
We will get married after that.
Ravi Verma is in front of you and..
..you're talking about
his death anniversary!
''Kamini, we will get married
that very day.''
l have a show after three days and..
..l want to announce it
before the audience!
l'll tell the whole word about
our love story during the show.
l'll tell them how true love comes
to life even after death!
According to Sir Juda's plan..
..we will give you a
guitar after an hour.
You have to replace it
with Monty's guitar.
''l'll do it, but what
would that achieve?''
''Sir Juda says, upon touching
the strings of that guitar..''
..Monty will return to his world.
Ladies and gentlemen!
''
Today, l want you all to witness..''
..the most important
moment of my life.
l'm getting married!
''Today, this very place.
At this moment.''
''
So please welcome, Princess Kamini!''
You must be wondering
why l am marrying her..
..when she's elder to me.
There's a story behind it. A secret.
And l'm going to reveal
it in this show today.
''
Registrar, please come on stage.''
l declare you man and wife now!
l want to tell you all
about me and Kamini..
..on this joyous occasion.
A story about love.

Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
You deceived me by pretending..
''..to be my late husband,
Mr. Ravi Verma.''
You've committed a fraud!
''You've deceived me!
- You had deceived me, Kamini!''
''
You committed the fraud, you!''
The daughter-in-law of Shantaprasad..
..the Princess of this palace
and Sir Juda's keep!
Take a look at nature's mystery!
l'm the same Ravi Verma
who loved you.
''l gave you money, fame,
comfort, everything!''
But what did you give?! lnfamy!
But not anymore!
This house belongs to Ravi
Verma and his old mother.
Who have come to live
here after so long.
''
Ravi, are we home?''
This house belongs to
that sister who faced..
..many hardships to make a living.
''Today, she's coming to
her brother's place..''
..to exercise her right!
''Kamini Devi, this house
also belongs..''
''..to those two kids, who received
nothing, but sadness.''
''And this is Surya, Ravi
Verma's loyal servant.''
The only lie l told you was that
l didn't know how l had died.
''But you lied that you, my
mom and sister were dead!''
Do you have any evidence that
you didn't kill Ravi Verma?!
Do you have any evidence that
you didn't kill him?!
''
Tell me, Kamini! Tell me! Tell me!''
''
Tell me, did you kill him or not?!''
''
Tell me, Kamini! Tell me!''
''Yes, l killed him! l killed
him! l killed him!''
l have killed Ravi Verma!
l killed him! He can't come back!
l've killed him!
''Officer, did you record her
confession? - Yes, sir.''
'''Had l known you would betray me,
l would never have loved!'''
''Film, 'Raat ke Andhere Mein.'
- 1969. - Hero, Dev Kumar.''
Super-flop!
Uncle Kabir!
''Sir Juda, it was my mistake
to deceive you.''
Give me another chance. l have
Ravi Verma's property papers.
Sir Juda's asking to hand
over Kamini to him.
''You fool! Those who can't
talk, keep quiet!''
''l'll sacrifice my daughter,
but never let Kamini go.''
''
No, uncle Kabir.''
lt would be foolish to sacrifice
Tina for this lousy woman!
''Sir Juda, we could hand
over Kamini to you..''
..if you release Tina.
We accept.
Tina will take a step from
there and Kamini from here.
''And if someone tries to act smart,
bullets will be fired!''
Rascal!
Dare you dream of marrying Monty!
Good day!
Chaturdas!
''You joker, you know,
l am the drunkard!''
''
Mom, carefully. - Come, mom.''
''
Hurry, mom. Carefully!''
''
Come, mom.''
''
You brute, l'll skin you alive!''
l'll skin you alive!
Monty! Monty!
''
Monty, Kamini has escaped from here!''
''Monty, follow her! l'll take
care of the things here!''
You fool!
Evil fellow!
''
C'mon! C'mon, hit me!''
''
C'mon, hit me! C'mon!''
''
Hit me, baby! C'mon!''
Yeah!
