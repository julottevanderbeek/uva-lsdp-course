The echoing sound of this Great hymn
''HARE MMA HARE KRISHNA'' -
Through our teachers,philosophers
and lords -
Away from this Motherland of
ours by 1000 miles -
Went away at a very
Iong distance
Reached till the Western Civilization
of Europe and America -
That civilization,which got suppressed by
making its own machines -
And because of the
financial success -
Had forgotton the happiness and peace
of a person outside and within
Became restless to gain the
peace of the soul -
By reaching among
them -
This divine prayer of
''HARE MMA HARE KRISHNA'' -
Had instrumented a new revolution
into their souls-
lt worked as an ointment on their
hungry,thirsty and palipitating souls
Who are these people who without
understanding the meaning of this great hymn -
And have altered the meaning of
this great hymn according to their purport -
And are seated oscillating
and unconscious
These people,whose religion is smack
Grass,Cockene,L.S.D -
And whose temple is open
physical relationship -
These people are leading every moment
of their lives only for this moment -
They are all lost under the influence
of intoxication and enjoyment -
They are all unknown from themselves
unknown from the World -
Unknown from their family members
unknown from the Society
These people,whom the world
addresses them as ''Hippy''-
Why are they running away
from life?
These people,whether they have a
problem with life of they love it-
To get an answer on this,why
don't l ask that person-
She is Jasbir,my own Jasbir
whom l liked a lot,whom l loved a lot-
My own part,my
own blood-
Jasbir,tell me,what do you want
what's your desire,why are you like this?
Jasbir,what are you doing,you
would have broken the glasses,wear them
Why are you both creating a nuisence
don't you listen to your Nanny
Come on,drink your milk,there's
just half leR in the glass,come on,drink it
Oh shit,Jassu,what are
you doing?
Get up and drink your milk
Prashant even you drink-
Come on,drink your
milk
No
No!!
No
No
No
Will you drink
or not?
No
Jasbir my sister,how beautiful
a child she is-
What does Jasbir want,what
will Jasbir do?-
No one ever tried to find it,
neither Mummy nor Daddy
There's a feast for you,this
evening at the Montreal Club-
You had asked me to remind
you,will you go?
Go and ask
Mrs.Jaiswal
Will she not get angry,if
l go in and ask?
How do l know,you yourself
go and ask
Mrs.Jaiswal,can l disturb you
for a second?
Yes,what's it?
This evening,there's a feast
for you-
lf you are going,then l'll
call them up
Ask Mr.Jaiswal
He told to ask it from
Mrs.Jaiswal
So,can't he himself come
and ask-
He alway's sends
you to me-
Go and tell him,to come
and ask me-
And,don't come infront of me
with this ill-omented face
Be thankful,that a decent girl
like Miss Swami work's in this Office-
Had l kept a beautiful and a
fast secretary for myself-
Then l would have seen,how you
would have shown your tantrums on her?
Then you wouldn't have sent her
to my room for asking small matters-
You would have kept her,
Iocked in your room
Today,you have again
broken this glass-
Will you make this your
daily practice-
Look at him,he drink's it
without shouting
And you...
l'll not drink,from
her hands
Then,everyday,will l go back
of you,by taking the glass?
Alright,come here
You don't come
neaf Me
You have removed your
glass and thrown it-
Had it hurt her eyes,
then?
Jassu look,if you don't wear
your glasses-
Then,one day you'll not be
able to see anything-
You'll become blind
Take my child
drink it
Why are you beating
the child?
You have never given me the happiness
then how can l expect it from children?
Brother...
Why are you crying,look,how
fast l have drank the milk
Brother,Mummy says,l'll not be
able to see anything,l'll become blind
That Mummy had told it
out of anger-
lf you wouldn't have thrown the glasses
on Nanny,Mummy wouldn't have told that
No,l'll not wear the glasses
everybody in the School mocks at me
Then,don't wear them ,wear them in
the House,and remove it in the School
Then,According to Mummy,l'll
not be able to see anything
Then,keep wearing
them
Look,how nice it
Iooks
No...
Look at me
No,No....
Look at me,look
Iook
Prashant,have Mummy and
Daddy come back from the Club?
Nanny,have Mymmy and Daddy
come back from the Club?
As though,everyday they come back early
from the Club,that they'll come today
Today,lnfact it's their party,
quietly sleep
What was the necessity of doing
so much of drama?
Who did the drama,
me or you?
l didn't commit any Crime,if l
danced with Miss Lal-
Even,you were
dancing
There is a difference between dancing
and embracing a person-
And,that too with a
third-class woman
Mind your language,you
are over drunk
l wasn't drunk that much,that
l couldn't notice your actions-
With that third class
woman,Miss Lal
lf you have seen the actions
then understand
What?
That,the time has come,that l
tell you,that l don't love you at all-
That's because,you don't
Iove me-
l love Miss Lal,it's because
she loves me-
And now,it's not good for me to
stay with that woman-
Who doesn't have any
concern for me-
And now,the time has come that
we get seperated from each other
Yes,so that she comes here,in
this House Instead of me-
And makes love
with you
Let that bitch come,l'll slipper
one on her face-
And l'll throw her down from
the window
Such prostitutes are sold for few
pennies in all the Club's like Montreal-
Even l am seeing it for the
Iast 3 years-
Today with this girl,tomorrow
with the other
Whom did you call
a prostitute?
Go and throw this glass on the
face of Miss Lal
On whom did you
slipper?
Don't think,that if you are
embracing her,you can kick me
l am your husband
your busband
Either you go off from here
or l'll go-
And l'll return only then,when your
ill-omented presence will not prevail here
And don't think that l am simply
giving you a threat
l have already got prepared
the divorce papers-
l knew that such a situation
would arise
Once l leave from here,only
then you'll remember me
l'll immidietly call up my Brother,so
that he comes and takes me from here
What's the point of staying
in such a House-
Where,there's neither happiness
nor peace-
Neither there's contenment
nor Respect
At the time of marriage itself
my parents were telling-
That without a due thought,you are
marrying a person in a foreign country
God forbidden if...
l'll not let my children also,
to stay over here-
The law will decide,whether these
children are mine or your's
l have already made the arrangements
for their Boarding School
Jasbir will go to St Mary
School and...
Neither Jassu will stay here
nor will Prashant-
Both of them will go back
with me to India
The one who can't take care
of his wife-
How will he take care of
their children?
Let's see!
Mummy,are we going back
to our Country?
So,will Jassu come
with Daddy?
Son,the court has snatched
my Jassu from me
Your Daddy did not want that
she should come with us to India
But,you are her big Brother
isn't it-
When you grow more
older-
You, yourself go and bring her
back to India
Now,neither you are Miss
nor Lal
Jassu,my child,what happened
did you get any dream,what happened?
Where is Prashant,call
Prashant,l'll go to him
l have sent Prashant to India
along with your Mother-
When you grow old,you go
and meet Prashant
So,will Mummy and Prashant
not come back again?
Look,my child,children should
be given good Education-
So that,they become intelligent
when they grow old-
They should become
self-sufficient-
That's why,sometimes for studies
they should go far from the House
Prashant will study
in India
And we'll send you to the boarding
School of St Marys-
Where good students study,so that
when you grow old...
You don't talk
to me
Jassu,is this the way of
talking to elders?
Now she is only
your Mother
No...,She is not
my Mother
lt would be good,if you send her to the
Boarding School as soon as possible-
She'll get refined
Give her to me,l'll make her lay
on the bed,you go and take rest,Go
Come on child,quietly go
to sleep-
And now if you cry, a witch
would enter from that door
Nanny,when will Prashant
come back?
My child,now Prashant will
never come back
Why?
Your Daddy has done a
second marriage-
She is your new mother in
that room
So,my mother is no more my
mother who leR me and went away
My child,your mother has
died forever-
And along with her
even Prashant
So,even Prashant
has died
Yes,even Prashant has died,otheMrise
wouldn't he had come to you
So,has the God taken Prashant
with him?
Yes my child-
Think that, God has taken both
your Mother and Prashant with him
But Daddy was telling,that he
has been sent to India
No,my child,your Daddy was lying
so that you don't get a shock
Mummy,l am absolutely fine
in the School-
Mohan and Jim have become
my best friends-
But,l remember you,Daddy
and Jassu a lot
When a plane goes across me,l feel
like sitting in it and reach MontReal
Even l'll become a pilot,when
l grow old,fly an Aeroplane-
So that,whenever l feel like
l'll reach Canada
Your son
Prashant,today aRer so many years
Daddy broke his silence-
l received his long
Ietter
And aRer reading it,my remembrances
as a child in MontReal became fresh-
Today,again,infront of my eyes,l am
able to see Jasbir moving,in the way-
Like that of 16
years ago
Because,it was wrong,that we
thought,that Jasbir is dead
Jasbir is alive,and she
is in Katmandu
l am departing to Katmandu
by the next flight-
And,l am also sending you a
ticket of Aeroplane-
Even you reach there,by the
next flight-
The Valley is looking very beautiful
from the top-
How is this City
Katmandu?
Prashant,this is your first flight
towards Katmandu,isn't it
That's why,even l thought,l'll
make this a holiday trip
l have bid a Good bye to
Indian Airlines for a month
Captain Kapur is siting at the back
isn't it
Yes,Yes
He'll accompany you on your
way back to Delhi
Still there are no signals
of landing-
One AircraR has iust landed,and
another one is ready for a take off
Come on,let's have
some fun
Let's make the passengers,have a
Iook on the City,from the top
Look at that,it's the
Temple of Suyambu
Arey Masina,you are still
upstairs-
You were supposed to get a garland
made of flowers for the God from down
Mr.Shastri,coming
Oh Bother Toofan,Today l suppose
you are making a good money-
Don't forget on making some,as
an offering to God
The money of the disiples of God
If it doesn't go to the God himself-
Then,where else would
it go?
Yes folks,the plane has got disapeared
now turn your heads over here
This Suyambu is 2000 years old
add 20 years more to it-
That's because for the last 20 years
this servant of yours-
Has been regularly telling this to
their Tourist brothers and sisters
Look,lt looks like a
Tibbatian working centre
Arey,you people,haven't you
seen an Aeroplane before?-
Come on,everybody get in,get
on to your work,fast
Order
Shit
Shanti,How is the work
going on?
By your coming here,has the
sales of the people increased or not?
Drona sir,lt's iust
great
Yesterday the manager sir,
was telling-
That from the time,you have kept
Shanti,as a sales girl over here-
The foreign Tourists are coming to
the shop by three folds more
And,even l have started making
rounds over here,the every 3rd day
Drona sir,that's great,lnfact you
should be coming here daily
Why not,lt's all
yours-
Had you not seen this wonderful place
we wouldn't have got it-
To establish this centre
over here
Manager sir,your thought is
absolutely wonderful
We want only wonderful
things
Shanti,was Sathi right,that
we should be coming here daily?
Drona sir,not tomorrow,because
tomorrow its the festival of Bhaktpur-
And we both Shanti and Sathi along
with the people of our dance academy-
Have fully prepared for
the God's dance
ls there a crash
some where?
Look,How l have decorated
these dresses-
Anybody's heart would lure
for them
l am luring
come here
You come here
You said,that you'll
hike my salary
l promise,lt will
be hiked
Look outside,people have come
to buy Clothes
This is Soaltee
ls that Soaltee?
Yes,the most fashionable
Hotel of this place
lt's loaded with beautiful
white women
l referred about white women
and Prashant,you got lost
Chatteriee,ls your Daddy
alive?
You are landing at Katmandu
and thinking about Daddy
lt's been 3 years,that he
has expired
Very soon,the parents die,children
cry and forget them in a very short span-
And in the due course,the longing
for their remembrances decreases-
But when parents are alive and
still stay away from children-
And their remembrances trouble
their children-
And the children can not
meet them
Then probably,you can't estimate
what it feels like?
Your father is in Canada,
Isn't it?
Yes Canada
MontReal-
And we stayed in a Boarding School
of India,right from our childhood
ln the last 16 years,Daddy has
just written 3 letters to me
And in the last 12 years
just one
But suddenly,l got a letter
saying my son
l have learnt that you are
a pilot in an Airlines
You also must be going on a
flight to Katmandu-
lf not,then immidietly go
on a holiday to Katmandu-
And Inform me immidietly,as
soon as you reach there
The Soaltee Hotel of that place,
which is recently opened-
There's a Casino,the moment you
get down from that stairs
The moment you enter into a Disco
theque,which is on the right hand side-
May be you....
Why so soon,what about me,who is been
standing for such a long time
Meer,let me take some rest,
But first get me a drink-
One Beer,l am feeling
very Thirsty
One Beer
Now come,let me see how much you can
dance,l'll exhaust you completely
Did you get
hurt?
Wait,let me take
some more rest
First,give me my glasses,let
me see who you are?
Now,catch hold of
my hand
Do you like
this face?
A lot
What do you think,no one other
than you can wear them?
Even with these
glasses?
Jenis is a wonderful
girl-
From the time she has come
to Katmandu-
The glitter of this Disco
theque has got enhanced
What did you say her
name as?
One Brandy
One more
lf you are waiting here for Jenis
then immidietly push off
lt looks as if,you are the
only admirer of Jenis
lf you have doubts about it,then
throw it out from your heart
No,l have no
doubts
And don't be under a mis-understanding
by looking at her dancing in this way
Meer is my friend,and
Jenis knows about it-
And we all friends,share
each others things-
One Branddy
Since,when do you
know Jenis?
Jenis,l am waiting
out
You went away,without even
answering to my question
lt's been how many days,since
you have come to Katmandu?
Still one day is
not over
And It's been 2 months since
Jenis has come here-
And l know her from the same
day on which she reached here-
And,lf anybody tries to come
between both of us,then....
Jenis come,lt's
getting late
Tell Dera to pour
another Beer-
We'll leave
aRer that
the bill
the bill
lf sir wants to drink,he can
drink at leisure in that corner-
Let him not take trouble of
mixing with us
Deepak,you are blowing
hot and cold
Look,l want to offer you
all a Beer-
And,your friend,all of a sudden
got angry
You are kicking away
a free offer
Dera,get me
a Beer
Who amongst you will
have a Beer?
And for a change,don't give
the bill to Mr.Deepak-
Take it from
sir
Here,have another Brandy,and
this is your entire bill-
To the Bakery
Michele,here your commission
is completed
This time,even if you offer a little
more commission-
l'll take it
Because,the previous Idols,which were
taken away from the Temple-
Had it not been smuggled in
todays flight-
Then you would have
definitely been caught
Michele,that's why l appreciate
you-
Because l doubt,that the police
was having a little doubt on us
Till the time,these hippy people stay
in all the Houses of your area-
And till the time,by your grace
Michele runs a Bakery for them-
Till that time,neither the robber
can be unknown,nor the robbery
They all must be at
the Bakery
First,you would like to come
to my palace or to the Bakery?
Yes,let's go to
the Bakery
Michele,they all were your people
they are all going towards Bakery
Well,your's as well as your friends
rent has still not reached-
Don't force me to give you a notice
of leaving this entire property
Drona sir,you'll get your rent
give us some more time,l'll tell everybody
Daddy,had written,that l'll find
Jasbir dancing is Soaltee-
And l think,l iust now
met her-
But,why did everyone say her
name as Jenis?
And,Even l was also a
little sceptical
Why don't l call Daddy
in MontReal
Who Prashant?
l am calling up from Hotel Mansarovar
in Katmandu
Daddy,are you recognising
my voice?
Yes my son,How are you,
your voice...
You should have atleast sent
a recent photograph of Jassu-
lt would have made my work easy
in recognising her-
So,Couldn't you
recognise her?
How couldn't l,she is
my sister-
But l want to ask you,that
aRer we came back to India-
Did she keep another
name for herself?
No,Oh yes may be she has
kept,out of fear-
She had taken money and ran away
about a year back-
And it's possible,that she is scared to
disclose her name out of the police fear
She had become quiet a rebel
before she ran away-
And for the last 1 year,we thought
that she,in an accident would have...
And listen,over there,there's
a very good friend of mine-
l have written to him also,
you definitely meet him-
Even l am trying to catch the
very next flight-
l'll telegram you,as soon as
it gets confirmed
Arey,leave,you'll go so far
to meet Jasbir at Katmandu-
She is not bothered,that she
has a Daddy
She is anyways absconding
for the last 1 year-
As though previously she used to
come,meet you,leaving her friends
She was always in the last
when it came to studies-
And was always ahead,when it
came to brash behaviour
Had my own daughter failed
like this-
l would have
squashed her
Where does this young crop
stay in Katmandu?
Who?
The same,who keep roaming
as Hippies?
Sir,sleep for now,meet them
tomorrow when the down arises-
You'll find all of them on roads
in Bazaars,on cross roads-
But,make your start
from Suyambu
These people have been singing
from age old times
And today,spcially for you,
l have made them wait here
Oh my Bothers
MOVe
Your fate,has brought you to
the Temple to Suyambu-
Definitely a miracle will take place
remember my words,l am talking truth-
And Lama peopel stay
over here-
ln case you go astray in Nepal,
and to spend your night-
You'll get a lot of peace under
the feet of Budha-
And Shanti is a fabulous
dancer of Katmandu
The moment she looks up at someone
he becomes mesmerised
And my name is Toofan
absolutely opposite of Shanti
And Toofan is the one,who can
make you reach till Shanti-
Give me a chance to
serve you-
Every Tourist of the world has taken
something or the other from Toofan
Only you
are leR-
The moment l got up in the
morning,l heard God's voice-
That a man from India
has come-
You'll find him wandering,here
in Suyambu,definitely help him
The one whom you are in search for,
she is not far from my sight
lf the ceremonial dot is put
on the forehead-
And if you concentrate on God,he
immidiately enters into your heart
Why have you stopped,even l
am deviated from the path
When did you become Jenis
from Jasbeer?
What did you say?
Since,when have you changed
your name?
What name,
which name?
lf everyone has put the ceremonial
dot,then come,it's getting late
That man has started following me,
are you liking this?
lf you have to stay in Katmandu
here aRer don't follow Jenis
Take the help of Toofan,your
entire journey will be a sucess-
OtheMrise,she is a girl,she'll put
you into such a trap-
That,all the followers of God
Pashupathi together can't...
They all stay here,in the
same House
lt can be known
right away
Ay! Masina
Yes,Brother Toofan
Who had come up?
No one
Does any one else also stay here
or have you given the House on rent?
No,How will Mr.Shastri,give
his House on rent?
Where did those people go,
who just now came up?
Which people?
A few boys and girls had come
here,isn't it
l don't remember
What's your name?
Daily How much lie do
you speak?
Sir,l stay in Temple,l haven't
spoken any lie till date
Then,why didn't you give me
the true answer?
Sir,The matter is,that they
gave me 2 Rs-
And asked me not to say it to
anyone,that we came here-
And,l told it
to you-
And sir,more over,they are all my
friends,l sometims dine also with them
Sir,lt's a fact,that Masina
never speaks a lie
And he is known to my
small Brother-
And there are no wear abouts
of his parents
Sir,he is lying,all the Gods and
Godesses of this Temple are my parents
Sir,he is saying
the truth-
ln Katmandu,there is
a famous saying-
That,Masina has been thrown
by God,straight from the sky-
That's why everybody loves him,
and no one refutes to his talk
Masina,l felt happy aRer
meeting you
Sir,even l
Will you become
my friend?
l'll difinitely become
And l promise you,that l'll
never ask you to speak a lie
And sir,in every true matter
l'll help you
Alright tell me,where do these people
live,who just now went down?
What do they do?
Sir,they are all,very
good people-
They never fight with anyone,
they all enjoy life-
They sing,drink,sleep,roam
and eat-
They are all called as English
Hippy people in Katmandu-
l'll Introduce you
to them
Look,how nice a person
Masina is...
But sir,don't try to bid a
price on me...
Actually,l'll take you to that place
where those Hippies go
Yes sir,on this you should
ask Toofan
Todays,it's the Bhaktpur festival,the
entire Katmandu will be there-
This,we'll spend it
on taxi-
And then,when you see Shanti,you'll
forget all these English Hippy people
Shanti this Toofan's heart throb
l know her very well -
l'll introduce you
to her
Small waist,Tender age,but she
is wearing a high neck blouse
Col. Give me my second
brandy flask
Col. Don't disturb me,suddenly
what am l seeing?
These two buggars never leave
her alone
How did she become
a Hippy?
Arey,Who is this young man
standing between both of us?
You iust have a look at Shanti's
dance,l'll just come back
Oh Mr.,Move from the
front
You,hit the stone
On Me
Then,should l have hit
a sand particle?
You are ruining all
the fun
lf you want to have more fun
l'll give you one kick -
And the gluing which is going on
through these binoculars -
You'll find the whole World
swinging within a second
Col. Who is he?
Boss,you don't get angry,our sir
is just joking with you -
Look in the front,you can
do business
Work,Work,Work
always work
Had the frock been liRed a little more
It would have been a different scene
l have tried enough,but...
Look,Look,...Look
You think yourself to be very clever
when it comes to girls
lf you are feeling very restless
come on,go ahead and catch her hand -
Let me also see,how much
courage you have?
lf l give one whistle,10 such girls
will come standing in front of me
My name is Drona,l am surprised
till now,how did you not know it?
l keep the entire city on the
point of my shoe
The point of my shoe is
also no less -
lf Shanti,looks at you,her sight
will freeze on you -
Her heart will throb
for you -
And the wave that would rise,here
take,its the local intoxication drink -
Have two sips with me,the sight
will have more colour -
And the dance will become
more colourful -
Sir,take it,take
Take it sir,don't refuse,its
your money -
lf she looks over here the lightening
will crackle more powerfully -
And the bottle will turn into pieces
once it falls from your hands
Don't break the heart of
a poor Nepali -
The friendship will grow more
stronger by striking the bottles
Wow! Great!over here too
my dancing beauty
Meet our sir Mr.Raia,he has
specially come to meet you
Not Mr.Raia,people call him
King Indra -
Who has come into the arena
to watch the dance -
Shanti,what are you looking
over there,look here -
l have brought so many
photographers for you
Before you wink,there will be
Wonderful my dear,every heart throbs
for you,but mine throbs the most
May be your pining breaks the glasses
of binoculars and the lense of your camera -
And the one who has to take her
takes her and flees off
l don't have an excuse
of a Camera -
But,l'll definitely go aRer making
your impression cast on me
Sir,what an answer,look
Shanti is enjoying,looking at you
Shanti,be careful before you
throw your arrow -
lnfact,its better if you stay
here itself
lf he loves you so much,then ask
him if he has the guts of coming infront
Sir,when the sight doesn't get settled
it turns and becomes shy
And the attraction which will come
out from this person's heart -
That will definitely penetrate through,
and make the hearts restless
Sir,don't leave it,you have won
Shanti's heart,she called you Kancha
And Kancha in Nepali language
means ''Young Colourful Lover''
Shanti,where are you going atleast
go aRer meeting my photographer friends
They have all come from
Europe and America -
To cover all the important and special
events of Katmandu in their magazines
l told them,who can be a more
eminent personality than Shanti -
ln the entire city,especially on
the occassion of this festival -
Just the greetings won't do,you'll
have to come in the night -
l have called all of them
to the casino -
They'll take your
interview too
Drona sir,my name is Prashanth
Forgive me,if l have exceeded my limits
l am quiet a low
headed person -
But you,this local drink and
Shanti incited me a little bit
Greetings
What was the necessity of throwing
the garland at him?
Didn't you like,that he made
Drona bite the dust -
Didn't allow him to hang
around near that girl
And now,if he again comes back
to enquire about you,then?
Listen
Had l leR away,without saying
a word of thanks for the garland -
lt would have been my
impertinence
lnfact,in the morning,you were about to
put the ceremonial dot,but you stopped -
l didn't like that
Now,there's iust one
thing lacking -
And if l put the ceremonial
dot on your forehead -
Put it and
See -
lt's been ages,that any one has put the
ceremonial dot on this forehead
You all come here
Remove these glasses,it doesn't
Iook good,it spoils the face -
Look how this is spoiling
my face
No,infact it looks better
Iook -
Don't l look more
handsome?
Jenis,l hate you
Where did l hear this word
''Hate'' from?
Deepak,you
Everyone,throw Deepak out
from our boundary -
There is no place for a person in our
group who believes in hatred
Okay,then go,bye-bye to you
and to your group
And take this,take,take more
drink and abuse me -
And go die with him and don't
come back -
And let me also see,how long
does he stay with you? -
lt's been more than 2 months,that
l have wandered with you like a dog
Ask Meer,Greg
and John -
l have quarrelled with my
father for you
And you,if you also want to associate
your name among these Martyrs -
Then,take her along
with you -
One more dog will be seen
wagging his tail
Whom did you call a dog
Do you know who l am?
And that Jenis,
come here
Jenis,will you go
with him?
lf you think,that you can come
in between our unity -
Then,every time,you'll get
insulted like this
Come on,Go,do
your work
Getting too hot
is not good -
Share a little brandy with us
you'll get relief
Drona sir,don't offer me
the Brandy
lt wouldn't be good for you,if
the fire rages more
You are getting angry on such
a small matter -
You can find such insects creeping
all around Katmandu -
Let this be between us,l can
take her whenever l feel like
Arey,Why are you insulting
my guest?
All this wouldn't have happened; Had
you not come here following that hippy girl
There is blood on your face,
wipe it off
Or else,take back your garland
which you made me wear
Sir,the battle field can be won
only aRer sheding the blood -
Come,let's have another drink
COMe,COMe
Arey Toofan,Masina,someone
has robbed my wallet
Nothing can be known in such a big
crowd,may be its fallen somewhere
Sir,how much money was
there in it?
Whatever,l had brought to Nepal
everything was in it -
Did a mistake,l should have
IeR it in the hotel
Sir,if your wallet has fallen somewhere
then,you'll definitely get it -
There is no one in Nepal
who robs
A wallet loaded with money
has fallen somewhere -
lf anyone has seen please
give it back,please give it
Sir,l have 5 rupees which l had saved;
if this can solve your purpose...
And the money which l had
it was yours -
lt became as drink and went
into my stomach
Sir,there's a way,if God showers his
grace on us,let's go to the Casino in evening -
May be this 5 rupees of Masina
proves to be lucky -
Yes sir,this is
also possible
You both are very innocent,if one
has only 5 rupees with him -
Even gambling doesn't
favour
Sir,come with me
Where?
Don't question
just come
Come,Come
Come,Come
Look at that,he is
our God
Sir,once l cried
cried a lot -
God caioled me and said,Masina
my son,never shed your tears -
You will never lack anything
in life
And sir since then,the entire
city looks to be mine -
Someone calls me son,and
someone calls me brother
Sir,he is right
Sir,l'll go and have
a word with God -
So that,in the evening you
play in a Casino -
May be the money that you
have lost is back in your pocket
But Masina,to stake,5 rupees
is nothing -
The money that we win,will be in
accordance to the money that we stake
Sir,l have spoken with God,and
to fulfil that,is my job
Aunty,l need some
money
Then,why are you standing
down,come up
Look Masina my child,l only
have 10 rupees with me -
lf this can solve your purpose
then take it
l need some money,
come with me
Now tell
lts 3,didn't l say that its
the money touched by God
Who allowed a small boy like
you to enter into the casino?
lts prohibited for
children
Sir is my friend and l have
come here aRer God's blessings
You play gambling by keeping
a child besides you
Your talent will be known only
if you play with a player
Sir,iust play one
more time
Masina is right
Even God has not permitted me
to play more than 3 times
Throw it in the same way,as
you threw it earlier
One Beer
Why are you making children develop
the habit of beer?
lf your lips are drying
then take this
Play like a sport,what's this,all
the four have attacked on him
Then,l'll myself settle my
accounts with him
So that,the wounds of yours
don't become septic
Masina,carry them and distribute
half from this,among yourselves
Mr.Drona,there is no fault
of mine in this
Your handkerchief
Keep it with you
May be,Mr.Drona will be wanting
to ask you
Mr.Drona has his own,of silk he'll
take that one out
What are you people doing here
go away from here
Go and follow him and see
where he goes
Neither you know to lose nor
do you know to get defeated -
This is the biggest fault
in big people -
And above that,you spoke
a lie -
Under the deception,saying that
journalists from all over the World will come -
There's a feast,they'll take your
interview,you must definitely come -
Where are those
people of yours?
ARer your father's death,l brought
you and your mother from Banaras -
And gave the support,and
is this the regard for it?
l got you a iob,saved you from
shame,is this the regard for it?
The people who shower mercy
don't show it
Not mercy,but l want to
shower my love on you -
l have everything,no one refuses
if l give a hint
Had love been a bargain,then
probably l would have told a yes -
But l regret,it cannot
be bought
You have completely finished
Drona's chance -
Take Shanti along with you,the
entire Nepal will watch gazing
l am wasting my time for the last
What are you blabbering
about Shanti?
Arey,What are you doing
hitting a child
l am watching your movements
since morning -
ls this the only way leR
to empty sir's pocket
lf sir's intention has gone wrong
then take him to some shady joint -
Don't ever take Shanti's name
infront of him
Sir,Shanti is not a
characterless girl -
lf by chance,he has put a wrong
notion of hers to you -
Then,throw
it out
Just ask Shanti also,as to
what she wants -
Don't you all have any other iob
other than Shanti
That Drona sir,has an eyebrow of
his being rich,of being a boss
And here,Sathi whom l
joined for the dance -
He keeps showing his right
On Me
And you,l am watching you
vagabond from months -
By taking Shanti's name you are more
worried about increasing the tourist rates
You don't listen to anybody
Do whatever you feel like
Why brother,did you listen to
what Shanti said
l never saw that this had some
cash in it,l thought it to be empty
Wow! This has Mr.Drona's rent
of everybody
Last night,l felt very bad,aRer
hearing from that wicked Drona -
That,if the rent is not paid
within a week -
He'll throw us out from
the bakery
This aRernoon when l prayed,
God showered me with money
Everybody's rent has been collected
and kept in this -
That's why Deepak,if anybody tries to
borrow money in the excuse of rent -
Then,plainly refuse
And Dera,today whatever edible stuff is
there bring it and keep it in the front -
Today,they'll eat
so much -
That for the next 1 year,they'll
not feel the necessity of eating
What are our people
doing? -
l told them to squash him,these idiots
are watching drama,aRer getting intoxicated
They even couldn't have a proper
aim of the bottle -
lf we don't leave soon from here
there is a risk of the Police coming -
l iust now saw Inspector
Thapa coming
Who,lnspector Thapa
Tell me?
Sir,there is a big turbulence going
on here amongst the hippies -
l need your orders
What's the necessity in
asking for it?
Sir,even your son Mr.Meer
is indulged in this
What,even Meer is
among them?
There is blood on
your face
Even on your face...
lf this doesn't stop in a second
l'll give the orders for firing
My daddy
From the time you all have come to
Katmandu,you have spoiled the city
Come on get lost from here,
and go to your dens -
And,tomorrow morning everybody's
Visa will be snatched -
And your entry will be restricted
in coming into this city
Deepak,Daddy will hold
you responsible
Who,Deepak,come out,put
him into my car -
l'll ask your daddy that he'll prefer
you see arrested in a jail or in house
Come on get out from here,take them
out,put them into the police van
Come,Come everybody
come out
No daddy,l iust came
here and sat
Oh! What do you think,can
you escape by hiding -
First and foremost,put him
into the jail
lf you want to sit like this
among these hippies -
Then,dare you enter into
the house -
Come,otheMrise,l'll tear your
skin apart with a belt,come out
lf you lock them into the iail,even
the jail will start rottening
Leave them by giving
a warning -
And tell them,if they again create
turbulence,the police will not spare them
Go,everybody can go,consider this
to be your last warning
Why are you repeatedly
following me?
lf the answer for my question
is given -
l'll try not coming back
of you forever
Quickly ask me
You came here leaving
Canada
What?
ls your name not
Jasbir Jaiswal?
Didn't l tell you
its not
ls your father not
Jaiswal?
Don't take his name
ls your mother's name
not Diya?
My mother has died and even
my father,now you go from here
Leave me
You trust me,are you remembering
anything?
Let me live,l want to live my life
l want to be alive
Jasbir has died
Iong ago
Mr.Upadhya,your son Mr.Deepak
is under my custody -
Even if you come and give his bail
l have no intentions of releasing him
And neither,l have any
intention of giving his bail -
lt would be better,if you chain him
and lock him up for the entire life -
They have spread nudity in
the entire city
Mr.l.G.P,l am myself sick and tired
of his brash and irresponsible behaviour
Here,take it and listen for
your ownself -
Even your daddy holds the
same opinion as l hold -
Aren't you ashamed,this long beard
Iong hair,lice in the head -
The thick layers of dirt which is
deposited on your body -
l don't understand the meaning of
you people joining with those hooligans
Daddy you are wrong,neither
they are bad nor hooligans
Then,who are those people are
they Prophets of today's era?
Uncle,your thoughts have
become old
And Daddy,don't forget,there is
one big gap between us
There is a generation gap between us
and our principles...
Stop blabbering
The only gap which is between us
is that l'll give you one slap-
And all your principles of which you
blow a lot of trumpet -
Would be thrown out and
will disappear
Go see your face in the mirror,your
appearance looks like that of a monkey
You are playing the Guitar?
You must be upset
Where were you?
l was preparing a Smoke
for you
l knew you must be craving
for it
And l have collected
everybody's rent
Next time,if Mr. Drona
ask's for it-
l'll throw them on
his face
l had told you that l'll be
Iate in the night
l shall lock the door from
outside 8 go
So that your sleep is not disturbed
when l return
lf you return so late in the night
can l sleep?
You should not worry about
me mother
Because Shanti is your
daughter -
And she knows how to take care
of herself
You go to sleep,l'll change
my dress
How can l stop worrying
about you?
You have returned so late 8 you
are going out again
What's going on,tell me
everything truthfully
l'll tell you everything
truthfully,mother
Have faith on your
daughter
lf we spend the
night here
God won't be offended
Why should he be
offended?
There are thousands 8 lakhs
of houses here
Will God not be pained
aRer knowing
That not a single person offered
you shelter for the night
l have come to fetch you
l'll take you home
Where is your house?
Right here,infront
Who all are there
in the house?
My mother
Besides her
Besides her,me
And
And God
God is here also,and there
is Peace also here
And let your mother sleep
in Peace
And the three of us spend the night
here at the feet of God
Sir to spend the night my house
is also there
ARer both of you feel tired of
talking,come over
ln the other room Mr.Shastri
sleeps soundly
He'll not know
Have you seen your
face Shanti?
And have you seen
yours?
lt's partly seen
l am a Simple Girl
of Nepal
But perhaps you like hippy
girls better
Wearing Jazzy clothes
How did you know my
preference so soon?
l can also dress
like them
Tell me truthfully what's on
your mind?
Why do you iump in the fire
frequently?
Perhaps l have come to Katmandu
to jump in the fire
That girl has tortured you
a lot
Which girl?
l was watching
everything
Do l look unhappy,
Shanti
Very much
You should be a keen
observer to know
You are also
unhappy
That's why l
have come
For what?
Perhaps by sharing the unhappiness
of each other -
We may get some
happiness
You have many admirers Shanti,why
should you be unhappy?
Suddenly if you start
liking somebody
Should one feel ashamed to tell
the truth?
lt will be really not a matter
of shame
Are you seeing,Mr.Drona
l have never been hurt so much
before as l am hurt today
Shanti,l don't know whether,l am
right or not
Why?
Because the purpose for which l
have come here,should not be lost
Suppose l get involved with you
and go astray
Go ahead,l may be
of some help
No,you wouldn't be able
to do anything
l can't tell you anything,l can't
tell anybody anything
What?
Nothing
Don't ask me anything now
l wouldn't ask
neVef
Because l am absolutely sure that
you will do the right thing only
And God will be
with you
ldol is of Gold
Michele was saying
ln America it will be worth
Meaning it won't be worth
Iess than 5-6 lakhs of rupees
When shall we take it?
No other night will be better
than tonight to take it
Once the idol is taken away
from here
For all our other theRs those
Iovers will be blamed
Has Mr.Shastri slept?
Who is Masina?
Oh Mr.Drona,so late
in the night...
Night is not over yet
Mr.Shastri -
This is the time for devotees to talk
to God who is in heaven
l iust came from devotional singing
That l should tell you that a
cheque is ready for the Temple
l will send it through Sathi
in the morning,please take it
Thank you Mr.Drona
May God give you a
Iong life
And you get more
blessings
Your blessings are needed
Mr.Shastri
Mr.Shastri he is the
same tourist -
Who had been quarrelling with
people the whole day
But what is he doing at this time
of the night in the Temple with Shanti
What obiections can we have when
Mr.Shastri is here?
Okay Mr.Shastri
greetings
Forgive me if l have made
any mistake
Mother also says the
same thing
That Guests are considered
as Gods in Nepal
lf you come with me to my house
mother will also feel happy
But what'll your
mother think?
Who is he,where has he come
from,What has he come for?
He is unnecessarily claiming a
right over my daughter
Suppose l give you that right
just now,then?
l'll wait
Golden Idol of God
is missing
Who is the one,who is
stealing the idols?
lt has happened 5 times
earlier also
Last week,it was on the
papers headlines
Yes l also read it
TheR in the temple!!
ln the last 4 months,this is
the 6th theR in our temple -
And the entire Police Department
is sleeping
Take out all
those files
Which relate to the
previous theRs
And the names of those people who
are our suspects
l will investigate this
case myself
Previous theRs are going to be
investigated throughly
lnform Michele that the Idol
should not remain with him
Till the idol is sent
out of the Country
He should hide the Idol
somewhere quickly
Listen,what happened to
Suyambu's cheque?
l am going there only
Mr.Shastri,Mr.Shastri
where are you?
Mr.Shastri what's happening in
our temples everyday?
l have brought Mr.Drona's cheque
for the temple
And find that God's Idol
is missing
Masina who was there aRer
we leR last night
There the devotional songs
were over and here
Forget it,so many Tourists
are roaming here
Yes yes go ahead
lt's like blaming
Shanti
lf you have doubt
on somebody
Then it is your duty
to tell his name
Masina what's the name
of that Tourist
Yes Prashant...
Somebody was saying
just now
That last night Prashant
Were standing here for
a long time
And aRer Shanti leR
Prashant was loitering alone near
the Temple till morning
lt can't be
possible
lt's a false accusation
on Mr.Prashant
He can never do such
a thing
Who is accussing?
Under the circumstances doubt
can crop up,what do you say?
Yes Yes
He can do it,why was
he loitering-
Near the Temple whole
night?
Are you sure he will come?
Yes mother
And l'm very sure that he
won't come
Whole night l was awake,
By seeing you awake
For one hour l am
seeing you-
Standing in the window
scanning the road
Getting attached to a stranger
so soon,l can't understand it
l think by now he must have
IeR Katmandu
l have prepared Tea
l have made it hot also twice
since morning
Come in the morning Deepak,l am
feeling very sleepy now
l had to leave you 8 go away
Iast night,you didn't mind it
You go now,l'll tell you
in the morning
lt's already morning
l came to know last night,how
much you love me
Believe me,lf Meer's Daddy didn't
drag us away forcibily
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,
always Daddy
How has our parents obliged us by
bringing us into the World?
lt was their moment o!ioy 8
passion that we were born
Yes,Had they asked us
before giving birth-
lf would have been a
different matter
Stop being Philosphical-
Daddy is bent up on auctioning
our dress shop
Come,we'll not give him a chance
to reach boutique before us!
What did you say?your Daddy
is auctioning the clothes!
Great! that means it'll be free
to the needy and poor!
Come on friend,help me in taking out
my pant from the Cup-board!
And help me in wearing
this stockings!
And quickly close the Zip
of my dress!
l am afraid,may be your father
may auction my nightie also!
Both Mr.Shastri and Sathi
say that they saw
Prashant talking with Shanti
all through the night there!
Now,tell me,who else was with
Prashant other than you!
Mr.Prashant is
not a thief!
lt is as truthful as the God
in the Temple!
And it may be as false as,this
isn't the Temple of Suyambu
Mr.lnspector! If Prashant
isn't the thief!
Then,no one else is a thief!
Because,Prashant is
the thief!
No one else is a thief other
than Prashant!
Mr.lnspector! Ask him,
where the 3 were?
What they were doing,all the
day with Prashant!
He,Toofan and Shanti!
Mother,l am going for work!
lf Prashant comes,tell him
that l can't meet him!
Tell him to forget about yesterday
night's matter!
And never try to
follow me!
Prashant is his name,
take down!
l am Toofan! and his
name is Masina!
We were with him yesterday! and we'll
be with him today also!
lf you want to take us to the
Police Station,take us now!
Because,we have not committed
any Crime!
Masina is the son of God! and
l am a guide here!
Whatever l earn daily,l offer
And from those,whom l earn
l first test their hearts!
And then their purses!
Toofan is my name,take it
down again!
lf ever this Toofan meets
a theif
He'll iudge him as fast as he
shows this place!
Write down! Prashant
is not a thief!
Because,Toofan is his guide!
lt would be better if you two give the
statement in the Police Station!
Because,lf people have
any doubts...
Yes yes...l have doubts!
we all have doubts!
And Mr.Shastri will also not refuse
because he had seen it!...
l know,why you are aRer
Mr.Prashant!
lf Shanti loves him,he
isn't at fault!
Go and tell Mr.Drona!
Mother,the times are no more for
pity and benefaction!
lt's a sad news for me to tell
and for you to hear!
That your daughter has got entangled
into the web of such a person!
Who has brought dishonour
to me and you!
She is going to be proved
as a thief!
That too,whose sin will not be
absolved for generations!
Son,l am unable to understand
whatever you are saying?
Mother,How can l explain it to you?
my heart is crying like hell!
Because,l consider you
very close to me!
Colonel! You explain her
everything
Mother,do you see that
thing opposite?
Auspicious Suyambu's Temple!
Yesterday night,there was a theR
of the most Beautiful Idol!
And everyone is doubting
that Tourist Prashant!
What did you say,son!
Idol of the God?!
And mother,l am sad for,everyone is getting
informed about Shanti and Prashant!
This one also...take this one also
take away everything!
ls there anyone here,who can buy
the full boutique?
l'll give full stock for rock
bottom price!
The stock isn't a
robbed one!
lf you want to buy,pay the
genuine price!
We have put in months of our sweat
in designing and making them!
And in these,our forthcoming income of
blood and sweat is also there!
And that too for
a good cause!
Look at that!
Whoever likes this,Can take
this free of cost!
This action will close the
Boutique forever!
Dare anyone touches them!touch
only if you have money!
Or other wise,who likes to
wear them!
What's the price of that pant
and shirt with silver buttons?
Why bother about price take
it free of cost!
Nothing less than Rs 250 it's
the costliest dress!
Don't consider it as your
Dad's free property!
These are,if not made from your
Dad's money!
Then with those money,they
were made?
Don't listen to him?!
Take away,whichever
you like!
They have already brought bad reputation
to our culture and civilization!
With their wrongful,worthless
and absurd decisions!
Quickly,empty this bus!
So that l can fill you
colourful people in them
And take you out of this
City forever!
l fully agree with you
and your way of life!
Whenever,l see you
and meet you
l feel there is an unbreakable
bond of relationship between us!
Will you give back that dress?
and leave this place?
lf you can stop me from buying it
take a chance
And,this is its price!
He is Prashant Jaiswal!
Your information is correct,he's
staying in Mansarovar Hotel!
And he is a pilot with
Indian Airlines!
According to his father's letter his
intention of coming here is...
That boy Sathi was always accusing
him,what's his intention?
For whom does this
Sathi work?
For Mr.Drona!
And l have heard that
Mr.Drona loves Shanti!
And Shanti loves
Prashant!
Yes sir! That's what
l have heard!
May be,it could be like this Mr.Drona
has some bad intentions in this?
Sir!
Accusing Prashant and
getting him caught!
The Bill is for Rs 65
And this Jacket! About which
you were asking! It's worth Rs 12O
Uncle! If that man outside
enquires about me
Tell him that,l am
not here
Tell Miss.Shanti...
Shanti is not here...
lf she comes back,give her
this on behalf of me!
This is from me!
You too wear it with as much of love
with which l wore this!
This is a product of Tibetan culture centre!
not to be given free of cost!
This Centre hasn't taken a contract
for the love of you both!
Where did that
Manager go?
l am not taking it
free of cost!
Mr.Manager please cut the price
from my salary!
Yes...Yes...Why not?!
No Mr.Manager,let him keep it
as a charity from me!
Wear it quickly!
Because,now she's going to take him from
here to Snowclad mountains!
What?!
How can l refuse your orders
Mr.Drona?
Look l am wearing
the Jacket!
lf you have gut's take it
off from me!
And now,l am going
with Shanti
While you are watching,to the
priest of the Temple!
So that he ties a knot
between us
Which millions of people like will never
be able to break it even it desired!
Mr.Manager this is the price
of your Jacket!
And a few more!
And balance keep them with you as a
charity from me,Mr.Drona!
Distribute among my Labour brothers
Iet them also have good time!
Workers! distribute among
yourselves this money!
And that Jacket is a giR from us
for your marriage!
And these Garlands
from us!
On this anspicious day don't tell Prashant
about Police enquiry and theR!
Bless them! Bless them!...you
have brought them together!
Mr.Sathi please forgive me
If l had hurt you!
Hey! Mr.Drona,l am not to be
faulted for this!
My Job is to show the Tourists
places of interest!
lf someone,develops
Iove for it
Then,whatever God does
it's always good!
Whatever God does,it's
always good!
lt was good...lt was good
Victory to Mr.Prashant!
Mr.l G P
l wanted to talk to you regarding
yesterday's Temple's TheR!
Just now it was on the
tip of my tongue!
You had asked it yourself and
saw it with your own eyes!
That Shanti and Prashant!....
...You too have doubts
on them!
lnfact,l suggest that,you search
Shanti's House!
May be it is possible,that you
get something from there!
Shanti is working here and Prashant
has come to meet her!
lnfact he was friendly with workers
and roaming with them!
There's possibility that he may have
passed from your House!
That you were watching!
l have a warant in my pocket
to search the entire premises!
Mr.Jaiswal,you never wrote
about your visit?
l thought l'll give you a surprise
aRer reaching Kathmandu!
But,the circumstances under
which we started...
She had to come from Bangalore!
And what a coincidence!!
Our planes reached here at
the same time!
l am unable to understand
your puzzlers!
You are coming from Canada!
Sister-in-law is coming
from Bangalore!
May be l wouldn't have
written it to you!
ARer we settled in Canada!
divorced!
Only children were the link
between us!
Prashant in India and
Jasbir in Montreal!
She too aRer Vanishing
for a year-
lf my friend had not written me
aRer seeing her,Here in a disco!
Atleast you could have made Jasbir
reply my letters!
lf l had concealed the fact that her
real mother and bother are alive!
lt's for her good only!
lnfact,initially,l never let her
see your's and Prashant's letters!
At that iuncture it was better for her
to forget about you forever!
As if you two never
existed in her life!
Then,would she have forgotten
she has a mother and brother!
Who are alive!
Thakur,that is our story!
And now,whatever you police think
about Prashant,thief or a dacoit!
He is our son!
And l have told you about the
reason for coming here!
Jaiswal! l am bound
by my duty!
Because,a network has been
established in the City!
So that,we police without
arresting anyone!
The truth will be out!
l have brought this
flower for you!
My mother told me that,Janice
Ioves flowers from childhood!
Come what may,she'll feel
happy seeing them!
Remember Janice! How beautiful these
flowers used to be?
Beauty is in the Heart!
In the Eyes!
Take a deep puff of
this smack!
This will spoil my chest!
l have Asthma problem!
lf you want to be with us
then be one like us!
Do you believe in
God or not?
Janice,will l get God
if l smoke this?
Great Sages and Great Souls spend
their lifes!
On the peaks of Mountains
chanting the name of God!
So that he could get him!
and see the Light of God!
And Visualising this
all of them!
Take deep puffs of this!
And when the eyes
are opened!
They get mesmerised by the
divinity of God!
lf you had come for love,then
don't refuse this nectar!
OtheMrise,l am visualizing that
emptiness will eat you from inside!
And the thirst will
start growing!
You have got peace in this!
There's Intoxication!
There's love!
Mr.Thakur's son is also here only
And he has come out just now!
l am sorry! l have a search warrant
of your House!
Why? What happened?
Don't you know about the theR
of Suyambu Idol!
TheR of Idol!?!
Golden Idol!! The costliest!
Don't you know about it?
Then, are you here with a complaint
that we stole that idol!
But,we have heard that,Mr.Prashant
is living here only!
Janice,are you very happy?
Very much! l never had it since
l leR my Home!
When did you leave
your Home?
May be a year,since l ran away
from there!
lt's a thrill to run away
from Home!
Particularly,when you know that
no one requires you there!
And you have so much love
That you are restless to find it
in this world!
l am his secretary,speaking!
Please,give the phone
to Daddy!
Sir,lt's a call from Jasbir!
Tell her to call back later!
He says you to call
back later!
Tell him that he'll talk only
if Jasbir dies!
Sir, She's asking me to tell you
that Jasbir is dead!
Oh! Give it to me! what a
catastrophe is this girl!
Are you dead? Can't you wait
even for 5 minutes?
For you,Jassu is dead
Iong back!
Why do you call me
when you are dead?
l am neck deep in problems
people are sitting infront of me!
Matters relating to millions
are being decided!
Come on,tell me what do you
want in a second?
ln a second,l want $500O
Call your mother and explain her
why you need so much money?
She'll give the money!
She is not my mother!
Madam,lt's a call from
your daughter!
Oh! yes!
l am Jasbir calling!
Arey! Maid! You said it was
my daughter's call!
But,this is Jasbir's call!
l am at Home,why will l
call you in a telephone?
Mother,l need milk urgently,
l have to go for a Game!
She'll definitely ask for money
you go!
Yes! What's the matter?
Shall l come Home
for sometime?
lt will be better if you stay with
your colourful friends!
l don't want your bad influence
on my children!
Anything special on this day,you're
showing so much of love
l never loved you nor
will l ever love you!
But Daddy told me to
call you!
lf you want money,call me
some other day!
Witch! My mother!
Jasbir! Are you calling your mother
even aRer my presence here?
Let's have it once!
From to-day,you'll call me Janice
not Jasbir!
My real mother was no better!
But in that party,l felt that her
Iong nails pierced into my body!
l ran to Dad's Office!
There was no one in
the Office!
My eyes fell on the safe!the
key bunch was hanging there!
l opened the safe! There was
Iot of money!
l just took $ 5000!!
And leR a note to
my father!
From that day it's been
travelling all the time!
Which places did you visit
in that period?
...And now here!
Don't you want to return
back Home?
l hate Home!
Back to Mother!!
Back to Daddy!!
l hate them also!
But,the word'Hatred' isn't there
in your dictionary!
From that'Hatred'only this much of love
had generated for this world!
Are you getting remembrances of
earlier times?...
About your Home!....
No,l don't remember anything of
my earlier life!
l had lost my memory!
Any relations?!
These are my relations
They are everything
to me!
Any brother?!
He died very young!
Jasbir! Your brother is alive!
l am not Jasbir!
My Office has been raided! A diary
has been confiscated!
ln which your name is
also mentioned!
l have arranged for
everything!
Your tormentor is sitting with Janice
for the past 2 hours!
And Janice is in
her elements!
l feel they have a previous
connections!
May be,her long lost Brother!
Brother!?!
This one is also a stolen idol
from some Temple!
l swear on God,my Mother
my Husband!
l am innocent,Mr.Prashant is
innocent!
We are not aware of anything
about this!
l am seeing this here for
the first time!
Please believe me!
Mr.lnspector believe whatever
she's saying!
l am totally confused!
All that l know about
Prashant is that...
lf my daughter has
married him-
She would have done it aRer
giving a great thought!
Then,Mother! Do you also doubt
that Prashant is a thief!
My flower had fallen
some where here!!
Remember Montreal Janice!
How much you hated to wear
the Spectacles
Every one was teasing you in
the School...and....
l once said,why don't you take
off and throw it?
Not one,but you have to place all the
flowers of Kathmandu in her lap!
Only then,you can get her!
That too new flowers
not the old ones!
She'll fall for new ones only!
Later on with Shanti
first sit with Janice!'
Go,she's asking for flowers from you
go and sleep in her lap!
Deepak,is your death
calling you?
Yes! But l'll kill you!
Nobody should come in between me
and Janice,l'll kill him!
Deepak! Why did you
both fight?
Shanti! Forgive me! For leaving you
alone and coming here!
Don't mistake me,l want to
tell you everything!
Where have you kept that
Golden Idol?
What?
Where have you kept that
Golden idol?
Golden Idol?! What are you
trying to tell me?
That idol which you stole
from Suyambu!
l am totally confused,what are
you trying to tell me?
Forgive me! l too don't know
what l am saying?
l am unable to understand
what's happening?
lt's good that you are not
able to understand!
ln my heart,l had vowed to
share only happiness with you!
l haven't given myself the permission
to make you sad with my sorrows!
lf you don't want to share your
sorrows with me!
Then,why did you give me
the position of your wife?
Then,listen!
The sorrows which you undeMrent
on seeing me with a girl!
She is my sister!
Sister!?!
She was separated years back!
Lost! And she's refusing
to recognise!
l don't know whether,l'll get
her back or not?
lf l try to make her remember
she turns her back to me!
When l leR her she was
a child of 8 years!
And she believes that she has
no brother,once she had!
Who's dead!
How to believe you?
l told you before God,holding your
hands to believe me life long!
Shanti! Has your belief had such
a premature death?
Whom shall l accuse?
You have been accused of stealing
the God's Idol?
What?
Our house had been raided and
a stolen Idol was found!
Mr.Shastri! Just now,Shanti's
house has been searched!
And they have got a lot of things
stolen from the Temple!
Then,have they found the
stolen Idol?
Not that one,but they
found another one!
lts obvious that who has stolen this
would have stolen that also?
Who's that?
Mr.Shastri,who else can it
be other than Prashant?
He has trapped Shanti and
married her also
From the day this man came
to Kathmandu!
He has disturbed the
peace of this city!
Neither you are peaceful,Deepak
nor you Janice!
There he has trapped Shanti
and married her
And here he is aRer Janice!
He is behind the great confusion
today at the Suyambu!
lt wouldn't be surprising if anyone
of us are accused for it!
On you! On you! On you!...
On me...may be on you Micheal!
That's why! Beware and don't allow
him into your fold!
Don't complain aReMrards that
Drona didn't warn you!
Mr.Drona is telling the
absolute truth!
lf he comes now,he'll not
escape safely from here!
Now,he went aRer
getting beaten!
But next time each one of us will
take revenge on him!
l'll not leave him alive!
No,Deepak,no!..
The thief who stole the Idol has
committed a grave sin!
God will never forgive him!
But accusing an innocent is
also a grave sin!
Somehow,l'll repent for those who
accused Mr.Prashant
Your repentence will be
Ieave him!
We'll never allow people from
other places!
And you have married a man who
steals Idols and sells them!
How can you say that?
Then,will he steal to keep them
in showcase of his home!
This tourist is an orphan! And the Police too
know who this tourist is?
No....No...its false!
He has trapped Shanti into
his web to cover up!
He should be thrown out of
this City!
By misbehaving with Shanti,he has
brought disgrace to the entire City!
Because,Shanti is like our Sister
and daughter...
This marriage is unacceptable!
Improper!
Shanti shouldn't repent for it!
We all should repent for it!
The entire City should do it!
For him Police has raided
all our institutions!
That institutions! Which spread Gold and
Silver at the feet of God all the life!
Our repentence will be to take
revenge on Prashant!
For our City's sake!
For our God's sake!
For Shanti's sake!
Shanti had loved such
a mean person!
Brother Toofan! We should
Ieave Nepal!
lf we can't prove accusations of
Prashant and Shanti to be false!
l too think like that!
The God inside me says...
What?
Come to Shanti's house!
What's this Shanti told about
stolen idols,temple and me?
This is Jasbir's letter,which she
IeR a year ago!
What did you give me other than
giving birth to me?
And that too was
an accident!
l got boarding school instead
of a Home!
And a maid servant instead
of a Mother!
For 3 years,l failed in
Cambridge!
l wasted your money!
l'll waste only $5000 more
which l am taking!
Don't remember me! Or ever
try to search me!
Because,l'll never remember you!
l am not Jassu! Jasbir!
Then open the heart of Janice and
see there's a ocean of love there!
ln which the whole universe
could take refuge in it!
And you say that,l don't
Iove you,Deepak!
This was what l used
to play!
What were the lines?
Do you remember anything
aRer hearing this?
l feel that my Jasbir is
somewhere here only very near!
This is the same song,which
Prashant used to sing for her
Yes,he's Prashant! Look!
He's standing there!
Why don't you go and meet him?
He's your son!
Your's too!
Prashant! My son!
l had given you a telegram!
May be you didn't receive it!
Look,where have l come
in search of you?
Son,your mother is
also with me!
Mother,why are you standing
so far?
Son! Did you meet Jasbir?
She's is in Kathmandu!
Did you meet Jasbir?
Jasbir is dead!
Her place has been taken
over by Janice!
Do you want to meet
your daughter?
Son! For that only we have
come so far!
Do you see those people
down there?
Smoking Hashish,sleeping nude
in each others lap's
ln each others embraces!
There in between them,your daughter
Jasbir is also there!
Wearing that long frock!
ARer 16 yrs,she's refusing
to recognize me!
l am not able to recollect
which song was that?
But,you can't meet her!
Janice has reached the
other World!
Where she doesn't have a mother,
father a brother or a sister
lf your heart is aching to
see her from near!
l'll remember it now,make
a smack for me!
No,everyone stop!
Don't stop them,Janice!
They have been inert for
a long time
They are inert and lost
Probably this is their atonement
Come foMrard 8 see her
She has lost her senses
She doesn't know who has come
and who has gone
Now its your turn,your turn
She is waiting for you to wake her
up 8 bring her to consciousness
Come 8 see
They have got God on
earth itself
And when they will reach God,
What will be their condition
Get up,go to Mt.Everest
go to moon
Nothing will happen by
Iying here
Singing under the influence of Opium
smack and hashish
Nothing will happen
lf this is devotion
HARE MM HARE KRISHNA that you
are chanting
Then throw away
these rosaries
Float these flowers in the river
Bagmati's stream -
They'll look more
beautiful there
Tear him apart
He has stolen Temple Idols
Because of him our Houses
were searched
Because of him we have lost
our peace of mind
This is lie,this is a lie
Save him!!
Prashant go away from here
they'll kill you
l'll not leave you here
See,who is there?
He is Daddy
No
See up there
lt's mother,mother
Daughter
No,Go away,go away
go away -
l don't want to see you here
l have no Mummy and
l have no Daddy
lf you won't leave him immediately
l will shoot you
l am warning you
Who all are staying here?
First arrest the person who has
committed the theR
Yes,Yes
Here,there is a man who
walks like a lame
lf he is not
the thief
l will stop my scanty breath
with my own hands
He 8 sister Janice has committed
this theR
Janice is his
sister
Both of them came to Khatmandu
for this purpose only
And they met each other
stealthily
And outwardly they were
play acting
Arrest him immediately,sir!
What is your name?
How can you say that he 8 sister
have committed the theR
Because l know where his
sister stays
Sir,you search
her room
Search his room along with
that Sir
Nothing is found in the room
of Janice
This is the Idol that was stolen from
Suyambhu
lt was found in
Michels's room
How did this happen?
Probably it reached your room
by magic
As you sow,so you reap
Michel
And the Idol that was found in
Shanti's house -
Who will reply to that?!
Perhaps Mr.Drona will reply
to it
Because Mr.Drona's silk
handkerchief -
Was found in the same room where
the Idol was found
His name is embossed
on it
Prashant,my brother
When Mr.Drona went to meet
Shanti's mother
By mistake he leR this
also there
This is play acting
lt is play acting or truth it'll
be known by your finger prints
Arrest him
Not only me but Mr.Drona has
also to be arrested
Because till date whatever l have
done was under his orders -
With his concurrence
lt's all a lie
Court will decide
about it
This diary that was confiscated from
your house is a proof
There is long list of your
foreign friends in it Mr.Drona
To whom many Idols from our
temples were sold
Arrest him also
Drona's friends may become his
enemies 8 help you
But Drona will never become
his own enemy
Drona will never surrender
to the police,never
Daddy both of you
meet Janice
What did you give me
except birth
What did you give me
except birth
What did you give me
except birth
l was pining for brother
for my whole life
When l met my brother
lt was too late Prashant
lt's full darkness
And l won't be able to see
you in this darkness
l am going in the light
Keep on remembering me
And never stop loving me
l have loved you too much and
l'll always love you
Because where l am going
there is only love
''MM KRISHNA''
