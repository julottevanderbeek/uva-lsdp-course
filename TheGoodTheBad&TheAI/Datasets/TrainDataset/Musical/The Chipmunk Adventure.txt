The taxi's gonna be here
any minute
and I知 not even packed.
Uh, has anyone seen my tie?
You're wearing it, Dave.
Uh, uh, thanks, Simon.
Don't forget your mittens,
Dave.
It's cold in Europe.
Oh, thanks, Theodore.
And don't forget
your tour book.
I'm marking
all the great cities
you'll want to visit.
Great, Simon.
Now, let's see. Shirts,
pants, overcoats, socks.
Am I forgetting anything?
Me!
Alvin, we've been over this
a million times.
Please, Dave, I need
a little culture in my life.
The Eiffel tower,
the Sistine chapel,
the Louvre in Rome.
The Louvre is in Paris, Alvin.
You see, I don't even know
where the Louvre is.
Please. Take me with you,
Dave.
Alvin, for the last time.
This is strictly
a business trip.
It's just not practical.
Besides, I致e hired someone
very good
To take care of you
while I知 gone.
Oh.
Did it have to be
Miss Miller, Dave?
Now, come on, fellas,
she's a very nice woman.
Yoo-hoo! I'm here.
Hello! Anybody home?
Up here!
Dave?
Boys?
We're up here!
We're up here!
Hello!
Hello!
We'll be right down.
Well, my taxi's here.
I'm sure gonna
miss you, boys.
Hello!
Just a minute.
David, your jacket.
Oh, thanks.
And your tickets.
Thanks, Simon.
Thanks, Alvin.
Alvin!
Don't worry
about a thing, David.
The boys will be fine.
Bye, Dave.
Bye, Dave.
Don't worry, dear.
You'll get to see the world
soon enough.
Look out on the left, Alvin.
You're not
going to make it.
Brittany. Oh, Alvin.
Faster, Alvin.
Faster.
Hurry.
Go, Alvin.
Brittany.
Oh!
Look out for that...
sphinx.
Aw, nuts.
Since when does Alvin
like playing
around the world
in 30 days?
Since he feels it's as close
to a world trip
as he'll ever get.
Come on. Hurry.
We have people
waiting around the world
for $5 million in diamonds,
and we can't get anyone
to deliver them.
What about Ivan?
Oh, we've used him
too often.
Jamal knows his face.
Oh, sorry, Sophie.
We need someone new.
Someone Jamal
would never suspect.
Don't forget, dear brother,
last year Jamal robbed us
of $3 million worth
of priceless, precious...
Claudia.
...gorgeous, spectacular...
Claudia.
...to die for gems.
Thank you, Sophie.
Oh, Claudia, please.
Not here.
Come on, Alvin.
Brittany, watch out.
Noisy brats.
Go, Alvin, go.
To the left, Alvin.
To the left.
Leave me alone.
Watch out!
The Chipettes are winning.
I heard that, Theodore.
You need to take the shortcut
across Fiji, Alvin.
Oh, not that.
It's too dangerous.
It's my only chance.
Oh, Brittany, be careful.
Oh, Brittany.
You're gaining, Alvin.
No!
Hurray!
I won.
You're lucky
this is only a game.
You'd never beat me
if this were for real.
Oh, is that so?
Yeah, that's so.
If I had the money,
I壇 race you around the world,
right now.
Are you thinking
what I知 thinking?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
It's too dangerous.
They're only children.
Exactly.
Who would suspect them?
No, Claudia,
it's out of the question.
Listen to me, Klaus!
If you think I知 going
to let you botch up this deal
like you did the last one...
must you keep reminding me?
I underestimated Jamal.
It won't happen again.
You bet it won't.
We're doing things my way
this time.
Well, unless you inherit
a fortune, Alvin,
I guess we'll never know.
Excuse us,
but we couldn't
help overhearing
your conversation.
We were just wondering
which one of you
really would win a race
around the world.
Hmm, I would.
Not a chance.
I know.
She could win.
Would you like
to make a little wager?
Why not?
I bet $1 million
on this cutie.
Hmm.
And I bet
on this handsome gentleman.
$1 million?
Uh, you're joking, right?
Certainly not.
We're quite wealthy
and very bored.
Allow us
to introduce ourselves.
My name is Klaus Furschtien,
and this is my sister,
Claudia.
And Sophie.
And we are The Chipmunks.
A-and these are our friends,
the Chipettes.
The chipmunks and Chipettes.
Oh, how adorable!
Well, what do you say?
Will you consider
our little wager?
A bet like this
would add a little excitement
to our lives.
Well, I知 game.
Me, too.
What?
Then it's all set.
We'll supply
all the necessary provisions
for you to race
around the world,
and the first one back
gets $100,000.
$100,000?
This is fantastic.
Come on, Simon,
help me out.
Absolutely not.
I refuse to be a part
of this deception.
Ok, Theodore,
it's you and me.
We just need Dave to say,
"hello, Miss Miller,
"I want Alvin, Simon
and Theodore
to meet me in Europe.
Bye-bye."
Is the tape recorder ready?
I think so.
I can't believe
you'd deceive Miss Miller
for a package
of tutti-frutti, Theodore.
What could be better?
An all-expense-paid trip
around the world
and a chance
at winning $100,000.
Besides, we'll be back
before Dave gets home.
Do you realize it's 3:00
in the morning where Dave is?
Exactly.
He'll be putty in my hands.
Hello, Dave?
Hello, Alvin.
Alvin, what is it?
Uh, I just missed
the sound of your voice.
Uh, so guess who's
in the house right now, Dave?
I don't know, Alvin.
Well, there's me and Simon
and Theodore and...
Miss Miller?
Very good, Dave.
Well, that's about all I need.
I... I mean, it's been good
talking to you, Dave.
Bye-bye.
Uh, Alvin?
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Now, what do we do?
We edit the tape together,
play it for Miss Miller,
and we're on our way
around the world.
Now, let's see.
Alvin gets the raisin bread,
Simon gets
the English muffin,
mmm...
Theodore gets
the banana bread,
the orange slices,
the cereal,
the bowl of yogurt,
the peanut-butter sandwich,
the pancakes
with gooseberry jelly,
the scrambled eggs
with toast...
I wonder
when Dave will call us.
Ahem.
Oh, yeah.
I'll get it.
Hello.
Hi, Dave.
What a coincidence.
We were just
talking about you.
Sure, hold on.
Miss Miller, it's Dave.
He wants to talk to you.
Hello?
Oh.
Yeah, about...
Huh?
It's not your hearing-aid,
Miss Miller.
Uh, it's a bad connection.
Oh. Uh. Oh.
Hello, Miss Miller.
David, are you drunk?
Hello, Miss Miller.
I want Alvin, Simon
and Theodore
to meet me in Europe.
Phew.
Bye-bye.
Could you repeat that, David?
Klaus and Claudia
wanted us here at 2:00.
I hope we're not too late.
Simon,
I feel kind of funny
about tricking Miss Miller.
It's called "guilt,"
Theodore.
Come on, you guys.
Wow!
Uh, so, Alvin,
you finally showed up.
Well, somebody
has to win the race.
Mr. Furschtien,
I beg you to call this off.
Don't listen to him, Klaus.
We're thrilled to be going.
Oh, Simon,
don't worry so much.
Now, here are the rules.
Each of you will be taking
a different route.
And to make sure you travel
completely around the world,
both teams
must deposit one doll
At 12 different locations.
You'll be given
the opposing team's doll
to verify you were there.
The first one back
wins $100,000.
A hundred...
thousand dollars.
Simon,
which route do you think
we should take to Bermuda?
Well, if you insist
on going,
don't take
the easterly route.
I heard on the news
there's a hurricane
coming from that direction.
Uh, thank you
for your advice, Simon.
What a liar.
He's getting as bad as Alvin.
But what if
he's telling the truth,
Brittany?
Oh, Jeanette,
don't be so naive.
He's just saying that
because our route is shorter,
and he doesn't want us to win.
On your marks...
Please reconsider.
Go!
Better get in, Simon!
Why didn't I think of that?
Do you know how to
work this thing, Simon?
Not a clue, Alvin.
Gott im Himmel!
Watch out!
Higher, Jeanette, higher!
Hang on, Simon.
Oh, no.
Oh.
Watch where you're going.
We had the right of way.
Whoa!
In you go, Simon.
Oh...
grass stains.
Still think
it's a good idea, Claudia?
They'll get the hang of it.
Jamal will never suspect them
in a million years.
Brittany,
maybe Simon was right
about the hurricane.
For the last time, Eleanor,
there is no hurricane.
Yes, the couriers
have already left.
You'll get your diamonds.
You just make sure
you fill my dolls
with cash.
Oh, play with her, Klaus.
It's not going to kill you.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey...
The girls' first stop
is Bermuda.
The boys are going
to Mexico City.
Is someone else on the line?
Don't be ridiculous.
There's no one here
but Klaus and Mario.
And Sophie.
Keep in touch.
Oh, what a brilliant idea
this was of mine!
It's not over yet, Claudia.
What could go wrong?
Where's my coffee?
Pronto. Is Jamal there?
What did you find out?
The girls' first stop
is Bermuda
and the boys...
You lose again, mutt.
This is
one of my Pierre Cardin socks.
Oh, Klaus.
Mario, where's my coffee?
Coming, signora, presto!
I've got to go.
I'll call you when I get
some more information.
Well, Sisman,
it looks like
you're off to Bermuda.
And you, Cuomo,
Mexico City.
Well, that was quite a breeze.
A breeze?
It was a hurricane.
Just like Simon said.
Yeah, Brittany.
Why don't you just admit
you were wrong?
Because, I don't think...
Brittany!
Ok, ok, I was wr...
wr... wr...
uh, Jeanette,
where's our first drop-off?
We meet Mr. Anton
on the flying surprise.
Ah! Isn't Rio beautiful?
We're in Mexico, Theodore.
Oh? Uh,
that's what I mean.
Uh, Alvin, land the balloon
by the fountain.
Like I said, "in the tree."
Your first drop-off
is the cluck n taco.
You mean our first drop-off.
I'm only along
to see you don't
get into too much trouble.
Hey, there it is.
The cluck n taco.
I'll have
with extra sauce,
and a tostada grande,
oh, and a quesadilla
with a side of guacamole,
uh, 2 chile...
they're closed, Theodore.
Oh, fellas!
The instructions say
to drop the doll
under the little sombrero.
Well, what do you know!
A-and one quesadilla.
Forget it, Theodore.
And you thought
we were gonna have trouble.
There's nothin'
to be afraid of, boys.
The fun has just begun.
It is our annual fiesta!

Hello.
Miss Furschtien.
Everything's fine.
They made the drop-off
right on schedule.
Brittany, l... I really think
we should just wait
until he comes back up.
But who knows
when that'll be.
Besides, we are losing
valuable time.
But we've never
been scuba diving.
And, and who knows
what's down there?
Relax, Eleanor.
The only thing down there
is our chipmunk doll.
Just remember
the team that wins
gets the $100,000!
We thought
you were a goner.
Me, too.
We would have been
lost without you.
I know.
Thank goodness,
you're all right.
What?
Just kidding, Brit.
Come on, you guys.
We've got the whole world
to see.

Signora.
There is a long-distance
phone call for you
from Europe.
Wonderful!
Oh, I知 sorry, Sophie.
Hello.
The girls have made
And the boys?
Wonderful!
Good.
Did the spoiled brat get wet?
Did the rug rat
get a little water on her?
This is excellent news.
Keep me posted.
Oh, Sophie, you got wet!
My poor baby!
Oh, Klaus,
you are so reckless!
I love Athens.
The nightlife, the girls,
the excitement.
Alvin, you've never
been to Athens.
Well, it looks like a city
I would love.
I'll have a large order
of couscous,
a-and 2 yalanchi donuts.
Quickly, please!
#
I saw it first.
Brittany!
Alvin, what are you
doing here?
We're on our way
to Istanbul.
What are you doing here?
We're on our way to Cairo.
H-have you guys had any,
uh, trouble along the way?
Well, there was this guy...
Uh, we had nothing
but smooth sailing.
And you?
Well, actually,
I get the feeling...
It's been a piece of cake.
The only problem we had
is crowd control.
We're the hottest act
in rock and roll.
But you don't
have that problem, do you?
No.
Ssh.
Sure we do.
No, you don't.
All right, Mr. Popularity,
how much you wanna bet
we can out-rock-and-roll you?
We've got to keep
these two apart.
Come on, Theodore.
Oh, my couscous!
They're for my 3 boys.
I wanna get 'em
something special
since they're stuck at home.
Hey, that looks like my boys.
#
# Sun goes down,
I知 just getting up #
# I'm heading
for the city lights #
# Radio blasting
on the way to the club #
# Gonna rock
this town tonight #
# "you're living
in a man's world" #
# They tell us
# But we ain't gonna buy it
# The things they're trying
to sell us now #
# 'cause we're the girls
of rock 'n' roll #
# Ooh!
# Yeah, we're the girls
of rock 'n' roll #
# Rock 'n' roll
# Whoa, yeah!
# The curtain's up
and I知 ready to go #
# My guitar is in my hand

that I壇 rather do #

in a rock 'n' roll band #
# What we have is
what we will be given #
# Heading for the top,
don't you know #
# We'll never
stop believing now #
# 'cause we're the boys

I could've sworn...
no, it... it couldn't be.
Uh, the boys wouldn't...
would they?
# Rock and roll
and rock and roll #
# I'm gonna rock and roll #
# Come on-a my house,
my house #
# I'm gonna give you candy
# Come on-a my house,

# And an apricot, too
# I値l...
huh? Oh, rats!
# Come on-a my house,
a-my house, come on #
hello?
Uh, hello, Miss Miller?
Oh, David.
I'm just calling to see
how everything is.
Oh, everything is fine.
It's quiet as a mouse
around here.
Alvin's behaving himself?
He is? Well, that's good.
Uh, could I talk to the boys?
Well, I don't see why not.
Uh, is Alvin available?
Available for what?
To talk.
Well, how should I know?
Uh, look, Miss Miller,
I just called to see
if everything was all right.
Everything's fine, David.
Well, give the boys my love.
Why don't you
give them your love?
Well, are they available?
Available for what?
Never mind.
Uh, nice talking to you,
Miss Miller.
You, too, David.
And David,
get some rest, will you?
Oh, that poor man is
losing his marbles.
# Come on-a my house,
my house #
# I'm gonna give you a fig
# And a date
and a raisin a-cake #
you imbeciles,
I ask you to take candy
from a baby
and you fail me!
I can see I need bigger,
tougher men,
to handle this job.
Just a few more drop-offs
and we're finished.
There they are.
Just as Jamal described them.
Come on, let us go.
Well, this next drop-off
in Egypt should be a snap.
Oh!
Whoa!
This happens to be
my favorite dress, Jeanette.
Uh-oh!
If you don't
put me down immediately,
I知 gonna get very,
very rough with you.
I will rule the world.
Sir.
Oh, no, you won't.
I will rule the world.
We have the girls
and their dolls.
Good.
I mean it, buster!
Let me go!
Contact Jamal.
Tell him he can have
the dolls,
but I want the girls.
But Jamal specifically
ordered the girls
to be returned.
I do not take orders
from Jamal.
I am doing him a favor.
And as payment,
I keep the girls.
Uh, dream on, tiny Tim.
Prepare for
the engagement ceremony.
In 10 years,
I will make her
one of my wives.
One of your wives?
Oh!
Excuse me, sir.
But, uh, you wouldn't
wanna marry Brittany.
She's...
well, she's very difficult.
And she 's not very tidy.
And her cooking is atrocious.
And she spends money
like a drunken sailor.
And... and when she doesn't
get her way...
that's enough, you guys!
The ceremony will take place
promptly at dawn.
Oh!
If you think
I知 gonna marry
that pint-sized twerp,
you're nuts!
Pint-sized twerp.
I love it, I love it.
What is a twerp?
You don't understand.
I don't care
how important he is,
how powerful he is,
how rich he is.
By the way,
uh, how rich is he?
An engagement present
from the sheik.
All the way
from the south pole.
Have a pleasant night.
A baby penguin!
Oh.
How cute.
Whatever happened
to diamonds and rubies?
Oh.
It's ok, little fella.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Oh, you miss
your mama and papa, huh?
The poor little thing
is homesick.
I'm not exactly thrilled
to be here myself, Jeanette!
We've got to find our dolls
and get out of here!
You two go ahead,
I-I-I'll be right back.
Why don't you just announce
we're making our escape,
Jeanette?
Oh, no.
How do we get our dolls?
Uh, we don't.
Wait a minute.
You-you've heard of
snake charmers, right?
Well, let's charm 'em.
# Honey,
you're a sweet thing #
# And you look so fine
# All I ever wanted
# Is to make you mine
# Give me a clue
# Tell me what I need to do
# To get lucky with you?
# Boy, I really love you
# With my heart and soul
# Honey, won't you take me
# Where I want to go?
# Give me a clue
# Tell me what I need to do
# To get lucky with you
# Getting lucky,
hmm, getting lucky #
# It's really
what it's all about #
# Getting lucky,
hmm, getting lucky #
# It's something
I can't do without #
# Honey, I致e been waiting
# Waiting patiently
# Let me unlock
your heart, boy #
# I think I got the key
# Give me a clue
# Tell me what I need to do
# To get lucky with you
# Oh, ho, ho,
give me a clue #
# Tell me what I need to do
# To get lucky with you
# Oh, ho, ho,
give me a clue #
# Tell me what I need to do
# To get lucky with you
# Give me a clue
# Won't you tell me
what I need to do #
# To get lucky with you?
# Oh, honey, honey,
give me a clue #
# Won't you tell me
what I need to do #
# To get lucky with you? #
What's in the ice chest,
Eleanor?
Oh, uh, just some
cold drinks and sandwiches.
Oh, Elly, how can you think
of food at a time like this?
Ok, let's get
a good night's sleep
so we can get
an early start
in the morning.
I don't think
we should have taken
this short cut.
I-I-It's too dangerous.
Relax, Theodore.
This isn't the arcade game.
Huh?
Phew.
Ah, uh, did you
hear something?
Nope.
Nope.
But, uh,
something's out there.
He's still afraid
of the boogeyman.
Don't worry, Theodore.
Alvin and I are right here.
Just try to go to sleep.
Ok.
Oh.
Well, Theodore,
did the boogeyman get you?
Theodore?
He's gone.
Hey, what's that?
Uh-oh.
The footprints lead
into that village.
Theodore.
Theodore.
Theodore.
Theodore.
Theodore!
Hi, guys.
Watch the old
maestro at work.
A little negotiating
and we're out of here.
We make you
heap good offer.
See pretty clothes.
Nice shoesies.
Make 'um plenty good music.
You take 'um
all this wampum,
and we take
'um little butterball,
you steal 'um from us
last night.
How about it?
Brilliant negotiating,
Alvin.
#
Oh, I hate to think
what's happened to Theodore.
Yeah, who knows
what they've done
to the poor little guy.
Theodore.
Alvin, Simon!
What's going on?
Uh, if I知
translating correctly,
l... I think they said that
Theodore's their long lost
prince of plenty.
Prince of plenty?
Now you're talking.
And the only way
for us to live
is to be his slave.
Slave? Forget it.
Where to, your royalness?
Jeanette, could you
pass me something to eat?
Don't do it, Jeanette.
When it comes
to food, Eleanor,
you're awfully selfish.
A penguin?
You were going to eat
this penguin?
Don't be ridiculous, Brittany.
We've got to get
this little guy
back to Antarctica.
He'll die if we don't.
And how do you propose
we do that, Eleanor?
Federal express?
No. I thought
we could take him.
And lose the race?
Jeanette, will you please
talk some sense
into your sister?
She's right, Brittany.
You're both crazy.
I'm sorry.
But we're talking
about $100,000 and...
uh, well, uh...
he doesn't look
very good, Eleanor.
I told you.
Well, how do we
get to Antarctica?
Just one little bite
for aunty Eleanor.
He's getting worse.
What can we do?
He needs his mommy, Brittany.
She'll know what to do.
# It's hard to remember
# Summer or winter
# When she hasn't
been there for me #
# A friend and companion
# I can always depend on
# My mother
# That's who I mean
# I've taken for granted
# Seeds that she planted
# She's always
behind everything #
# A teacher, a seeker
# With both arms,
outreacher #
# My mother
# That's who I mean
# Wish I could slow down
# The hands of time
# Keep things
the way they are #
# If she said so
# I would give her
the world #
# If I could
# I would
# My love and my laughter
# From here ever after

We better call
miss Furschtien.
Hello.
Ma'am, we've located
the girls.
They've strayed
nearly a 1,000 miles
off course.
What?
They must have discovered
the jewels and decided
to make a break for it.
Well, ma'am,
we'll try to stop them.
They're very, very slippery
#
I don't want your excuses.
I want those dolls!
And don't come back
without them!
There's the balloon.
Let's go.
Mmm.
Goodbye. Thank you.
Give us back our dolls,
you creeps.
Thanks again. Bye.
How are we gonna
explain this to Claudia?
Hey, you can tell her.
Listen, it's your...
every time we go
into a some kind
of a problem,
you're always trying
to weasel out of it.
I know what's wrong with you.
I don't get it.
Why are people
willing to kill
for these dolls?
Because they're so cute.
Oh, look at the
sweet little face.
Wait a minute.
Look at this.
Diamonds!
Open a chipmunk doll.
There must be thousands
of dollars in each of these.
I don't believe it.
This whole race
was just to get us to
deliver these diamonds.
And if we're in danger,
the boys must be
in danger, too.
We've got to find them.
and prince Theodore
has a craving
for mushrooms.
I hope he chokes on 'em.
Alvin.
Now, I致e had it.
Hey, Alvin,
look over here.
What is it, Simon?
It's ancient writing
that says,
"sacrifice the full moon
on the prince of plenty."
That doesn't make
any sense.
Oh, how silly of me.
It's "eyes" before "eats"
except after "tea."
I got it reversed.
It says, "sacrifice
the prince of plenty
on the full moon".
Oh, no.
They're going to sacrifice
Theodore tonight.
Over my dead body.
You mean,
over our dead bodies.
Are there, uh, any,
uh, favorite songs
you'd like to hear
before we go?
Hmm. Worry burry.
Worry burry?
Do you think
he means wooly bully?
Well, it's worth a try.
# Uno, dos
# One, two, tres, quatro
yeah, worry burry.
Watch it now.
He'll get you.
Here it comes, here it comes.
I love it. Get down, mama.
Watch it now.
Get down, get runky.
# Matty told Hatty
# About a thing she saw
# Had 2 big horns
# And a wooly jaw
# Wooly bully
# Worry burry
Sure, right.
# Wooly bully, wooly bully
# Wooly bully
# Hatty told Matty
# Let's don't take no chance
# Let's not be l-7
# Come and learn to dance
# Wooly bully
That's right.
# Wooly bully, wooly bully
# Wooly bully
Watch it now, watch it,
watch it, watch it.
Hey, what's all that ruckus?
It looks like
a big celebration.
And they've got a bonfire.
And a chubby little
butterball tied to a stake.
It's Theodore.
They've got The Chipmunks.
Come on!
# Matty told Hatty
# That's the thing to do
# Get you someone really
# To pull the wool with you
# Wooly bully
# Worry burry
# Wooly bully, wooly bully
# Wooly bully #
Watch it now,
watch it, here he comes.
We're sunk.
He's done it.
Shouldn't I thank them?
They were
very sweet to me.
Send them a postcard,
Theodore.
heard from anyone!
Those incompetent fools!
Where could they be?
I'll find them
if it's the last thing I do.
And when I get my hands
on those...
Oh, my head.
Claudia,
it's 5:00 in the morning.
What's going on?
Oh, nothing, Klaus.
Sophie just knocked
over the vase.
Why, you little mutt.
That was a priceless antique.
Klaus, heel!
Really, Klaus,
you're such a bully.
Go back to bed.
What?
Any word yet?
Yes, our men
have spotted them.
They should be landing
at the airport shortly.
I'll meet you there,
inspector.
We'll take you
to the airport, Mario.
Are we there yet?
Theodore, if you ask one...
wait a minute. We're home.
Please fasten
your seat belts.
There they are!
Children, oh, children.
Oh, how good
to see you, darling.
Don't "children" us.
Yeah, we know
all about the diamonds.
Now don't try
anything stupid.
Just hand over the dolls.
Come on.
# We don't have to do
# What you tell us
to do no more #
# You get what you need and
you don't want it anymore #
# We don't cry now
come on, this way.
# We don't know how
come back here!
# We heard what you said
and we don't believe
a word you say #
# The hill is a high one
but we'll climb it anyway #
# There's no doubt
# You'll find out
# We're the ones on the run
# We're the girls,
we're the diamond dolls #
# Diamond dolls
# It's a ravenous world
and the ceiling is very tall #
after them.
# Do, do, do, do,
do, do, do #
# There's a weight
and a climb #
# And a ladder and many fall
it's too late, Claudia.
They'll make a scene
in front of all these people.
Then we'll tell them
we have the babysitter.
What was her name?
Miss, uh, Miss Miller.
Oh, wait.
I have a message
from Miss Miller.
Hand over the dolls.
And do as we say
if you ever want to see
your babysitter again.
Hmm.
Alvin.
Of course, you know Sophie.
But I don't believe
you've met Mario.
He has a tendency
to talk too much.
Get in.
Hey, my cap.
Loading and unloading
of passengers only. No...
hey, this cap
looks like Alvin's.
Dave!
Huh?
Help!
Somebody help!
My son's in trouble!
Inspector Jamal. Let's go.
# Silver, platinum
# I pass on them
# You can have them
# I know what I want
# We're the ones on the run

we're the diamond dolls #

# I told the witch doctor
I was in love with you #
# I told the witch doctor
I was in love with you #
# And then the witch doctor
he told me what to do #
# He said that #
now let's see.
David is arriving
at European airlines.
Oh, oh, there it is.
In a few minutes,
we'll be on our private jet
to Costa Rica.
Here's to me.
Oh, good heavens!
You should have been
wearing your seat belts.
Huh?
My car!
I hope you have
insurance, buster.
Huh?
Never in all my life have
I seen such reckless driving.
Miss Miller?
Huh, boys?
Kids!
Dave, Dave.
Boy, it's good to
see you Dave, l... I think.
Well, if it isn't
my old friends
Klaus and Claudia.
Here's to you, Claudia.
If so much as one hair is
out of place on my Sophie,
You'll live to regret it!
I can understand
this deception from Alvin,
but not you, Theodore.
I'm sorry, Miss Miller.
Thanks for all your help
inspector.
Thank you.
Hey, what about my $100,000?
Your $100,000?
We won the race.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
All right, you two.
We've got a lot of
talking to do.
Yes, Dave.
Maybe you should let
Dave drive, Miss Miller.
I wouldn't think of it.
Besides driving
relaxes me.
Get in, David.
But, Dave,
they promised us $100,000.
Not now, Alvin.
But they've got
$5,000,000 in diamonds.
Don't we get anything?
Alvin!
But we've just cracked
a huge smuggling ring.
Shut up, Alvin!
Ok, ok. We'll give you half.
Alvin!
