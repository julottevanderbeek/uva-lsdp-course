Whoever this Josh Chan is,
you are, you're obsessed with him.
So you're saying that I
moved here from New York
and I left behind a job
that would've paid me
I dated for two months when
I was 16 at a summer camp?
- I did not do that.
- What's the deal with you and Josh?
Josh isn't my type.
But, like, speaking of types,
- like, what type's his girlfriend?
- I should go.
Did you see this résumé?
Harvard? Yale?
What the hell is she doing here?
I was working hard
at a New York job
Making dough but it made me blue
One day I was crying a lot
And so I decided to move
To West Covina, California
Brand new pals and new career
It happens to be where Josh lives
But that's not why I'm here
-  She's the crazy ex-girlfriend
-  What? No, I'm not.
That's a sexist term.
Can you guys stop
singing for just a second?
The situation's a lot
more nuanced than that.
C-R-A-Z-Y
Okay! We get it!

REBECCA: Ugh...
It's so hot.
Is it always this hot?
Yeah.
You're getting a sexy SoCal farmer's tan.
Now, that's a good look.
- So I've been thinking about it...
- Yes?
And there could be, like,
a million reasons why
Josh hasn't texted me back.
Look, he specifically wrote in his text:
“Want to grab dinner? Smiley face.”
Which is the least he
can do, since you left
your great job and moved
to this dump to be with him.
Hey! I didn't move here for him, remember?
I moved here because I needed a change
and Josh just happens to be here.
Get it straight.
Oh, are we still doing that? Okay.
All right, just let me know
when we can stop, because
I actually want to know what's keeping him
from having dinner with his dear old friend
- from summer camp.
- I don't know.
- What are you... Don't do that.
- Let's see what he's been up to.
- You can't take a person's personal
electronic... - I just did
Oh, look at this.
What? Wait, wait, wait.
Has he updated his status
in the last 20 minutes?
Not that I've been checking, I was...
Checking? Oh, that is amateur hour.
You gotta change your
push notifications. Look.
He is going to a club called Spiders
with his friends tonight.
And so, we will, too.
Spiders. I drove by there the other night.
It was hopping.
But I always wonder, though,
is it possessive Spider's
or plural Spiders?
Because every time I see a flyer for it,
the apostrophe's in a different location.
What difference does it make?
It doesn't make a
difference, it's just, like,
it's two different things.
Like, either the club is owned by a spider
or the club is filled with,
like, a bunch of spiders.
So... it's a different thing.
Okay, let's go back to
what you were saying.
You know what?
I actually really like your idea.
Let's go to Spider's tonight.
Just, like, as a gal date.
Like, not-not 'cause Josh is there.
In fact, I hope Josh isn't there,
so that when I do my sexy
dance moves, it's just for me.
It's just for me.
Oh!
Hey!
Hi. Cool hat.
Hats are the new tattoos.
Oh, yeah, I read that.
Let's go find Josh.
Okay, well, you can find Josh
and I'll be in there just checking out
the local indigenous culture. Uh-huh.
Well, while you're in there chatting
about the majestic
history of the 10 freeway,
I'm gonna be asking Josh Chan
why he's been dodging you.
See, now, there it's possessive.
PAULA: Yo...
You see my hat?
It's like a tattoo,
but on my head.
: Let us in.
You on the list, Mrs. Butterworth?
I don't care for that tone...
- Or that reference.
- Okay. Um, I... I...
I got this. Sorry.
Sorry, she doesn't know about club culture.
Um... I should've done this earlier,
it's more suave, but... let us in?
Thank you.
Yo, this is $500.
Um... yeah.
Yeah, it is.
Look, if this had been a 20, you'd be good.
But either you're a cop
or you're a drug dealer.
Either way, y'all ain't getting in.
Okay.
Okay...
Okay. Yeah.
No, not tonight. No.
Oh, see... Hey, hey.
Come on. Come on. Come on, come on.
You gonna get runs in your stockings
and all that stuff,
man, you don't want that.
Gotta keep moving. Come on.
Okay. All right.
I'm sorry, not tonight.
Just... easy, easy, killer.
All right. You know.
All right. Well, if we're
not getting in the club,
do you want to...
do you want to hang out, do something else?
Ooh!
There's a new Olive Garden in Arcadia.
They're still figuring out their portions.
Nah, I don't...
I kind of want to just call it a night.
No... oh, come on, man.
I got a pass.
I told Scott I was gonna be
out all night having my period.
He asked me no questions.
I just, you know...
coming from New York,
a quiet night is a luxury.
- Can we take a rain check?
- All right.
I like alone time.
No...
I love alone time.
And it was then the Fuhrer decided upon
the Final Solution.
What are you doing?
MAN : Uh, Danny, could I
get a price check on, uh, pork rinds?
Price check on pork rinds.
REBECCA:
Josh-osh-osh-osh.
Can I help you, ma'am?
No, I'm fine.
I'm just watching my ex-boyfriend
make out with the hottest
girl I've ever seen.
Ah, she's okay.
No...
You know what?
She's smoking.
Oh, yeah, I see it now.
She's got one of them secret booties.
Oh, does he know you still dig him?
He's just a friend!
Sorry. It's a long story.
Oh! Whoa, whoa!
Whoa. Sor...
Hey.
Wow.
Um... so I-I texted you after the party,
but I didn't hear back.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I've been really busy with
work. Seriously, though,
now that I have you here,
could we maybe have a postmortem
on the whole makeout-crying session?
I really don't think it's the time
or the place. I...
Wow.
Dude, they got Twizzlers.
- Throwback!
- That's great.
Um, Rebecca,
let me introduce you to
these two fine gentlemen.
This is Hector, 203rd
best surfer in the state.
- 202nd.
- GREG: Great.
And this is White Josh,
so named because he looks just like Josh,
except for he's white.
Also, my... my name is also Josh.
Mmm.
Well, we've all met.
Um, hopefully the next time, I'll be...
Better looking?
- Thanks.
- He doesn't mean that.
Uh... it's fine.
Um, I will text you at some point,
I just... I-I really... I have to...
- Okay.
- Yeah. I have to go.
Bras are in aisle one.
That's really nice.
It's, like, only $5.26.
That's not that bad.
Um, I think the ice cream is down here.
What are you talking about, Joshy?
It's right in front of you.
Are you okay?
Wait, why is Greg talking to a homeless?
Oh, hi, Rebecca.
Hey.
You know each other?
Yeah, uh, this is my friend Rebecca.
We, um,
met at summer camp,
like, a million, billion,
trillion, like, a zillion years ago.
Summer camp?
You guys met in summer camp?
Yeah, we were like...
like, eight years old.
Right, Rebecca?
No, we were...
We were eight and a half.
That was very important to me
when I was eight. I'm eight and a half!
You know. Kids.
Uh, this is Valencia.
My girlfriend.
Hi.
Nice to meet you. Oh. Hi.
My lady.
GREG: I'm confused.
You don't know each other from New York?
- No.
- Nope.
Wait.
How do you guys know each other?
Oh, we, um,
met at Home Base, um,
and then we just became, like, cazh buds,
and, yeah, that's-that's
just, that's what happened.
Valencia, that's such a beautiful name.
What's the origin of that?
Well, it used to be Maria,
but I never felt like a Maria
so I changed it to my mother's
maiden name: “Valencia”"
It's the Spanish word for “brave”"
That's really cool.
Actually, I thought
about doing the same thing
with my mother's maiden name.
Um, it's “Garfinkel,”
which is the Yiddish word
for “diamond dealer.”
Um...
God, I love that dress.
Can I just say, like,
I cannot wear dresses like that,
and you pull it off so, so well.
I mean, you are... you're just so pretty.
I mean, you have a great body.
Well, I teach yoga. Keeps me fit.
Oh, my God, I love yoga!
That's so funny that
we're meeting right now,
'cause I love yoga.
You do?
Yeah, I-I love it.
Well, maybe you should come
to one of my classes.
I would love that!
- I would love to have you!
- I would love to be had!
: Why are their voices so high?
REBECCA: Cool.
Well, God, this has
just been the best night.
It was so great meeting you.
I'm just going to gracefully exeunt,
pursued by a bear.
Uh, hey, I'll be right back.
Can you get me two more pints?
Oh, my God, she's so pretty,
oh, my God, she's so pretty,
oh, my God, she's so pretty,
oh, my God, she's so pretty.
Hi.
Hey.
What was up with that
“eight years old” thing?
We were 16 when we were at camp.
No biggie. Just, uh...
the thing with us at
camp, no one knows that,
especially Valencia,
so let's just keep it on the DL.
- Is this because I look like a homeless?
- No, just,
Valencia, she sometimes
sweats these things.
You get it.
Wait...
Is that the reason you haven't
gotten back to me about dinner?
Come on, dude.
I'm no threat!
Look at her!
Look at me!
Her! Me!
Yoga! Homeless!
And I... I have no problem with her.
I think she's terrific.
I mean, did you see how we...
we instantly bonded? Actually, I...
I would like to be friends with her.
What? No.
That's not a good idea.
I don't think you guys should be friends
or anything like that.
Okay, okay. No, you're right, you're right.
I am.
Just chill, okay?
Okay.
Anyway,
- I got to roll. Catch you later.
- Oh, okay.
I'll catch you...
Hey, Val? I got your chin.
I got your chin.
What are you doing?
_
_
_
Josh's girlfriend is so nice.
Like, stop being this nice.
So, I got provisions for us
for while we work on this arbitration,
because it is going to be...
: a long day.
First...
Mama got you the strawberry donuts
that you like from the
place around the corner.
And...
look at what I found at the car wash.
Sh-bam!
It's a Statue of Liberty key chain.
'Cause you're from New York.
Do you get it?
Do you, do you like it?
Yeah, no...
I'm sorry, I love it, yeah!
Oh, that's so sweet.
I don't have anything for you.
Put it on your keys!
Okay, yeah.
No, I mean, like, right now!
'Cause I want to, I
want to watch it happen!
Oh, okay.
Ah, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I always wanted a daughter.
I didn't, my-my kids are not daughters.
They're terrible.
I'll-I'll tell you about it later.
Or now.
So, Valencia's interests
include tempeh patties,
and Vampire Weekend.
I just feel like we have so much in common.
What's Vampire Weekend?
Um, it's a weekend away with vampires.
I'm pretty sure it's not that.
It's very popular.
Let me see her picture.
Let me see her face.
Here, take a look, see?
PAULA:
Whoa-ho-ho!
She is smoking!
So pretty, right?
And Josh says I can't be friends with her,
but I really like her.
Come on.
You loathe her.
Um, no, I don't.
Oh, okay!
Let me tell you how this works.
Women of equal sexual
viability hate each other.
Even if they pretend to like each other.
And that is how it has worked
since the day vagina’s were invented.
See, okay, look.
You're like these two, all right?
You're Taylor Swift and she's Katy Perry.
Oh, wait a minute...
Maybe you're Katy Perry.
No! No, you're Taylor Swift.
You're uptight and weird, right?
Okay, this is why I don't
read this drivel, right?
Because it perpetuates
the very misogynist myth
that women can't get along, right?
Look at this cover!
“Femme feud, girl fight.
Who wore it better?”
It's like, “Who wore it equally?”
God, you're boring.
Look, I get what you're doing
with this girl and I totally approve!
You befriend the enemy and you
get more face time with Josh.
If you really neutralize her,
maybe she'll give you some
solo time with him, so...
No, no, mm-mm, no.
That's not what I'm doing.
That's not what I'm doing at all.
I know, that is not what you're doing
at all... wink.
No, I...  I
really want to be her friend.
Like, genuinely want to be her friend.
- Wink.
- Stop winking!
Ooh. Oh, she's teaching a
yoga class today at 3:00.
Oh, that's, like, now!
Change of plans.
Eat the donut for me.
I'm gonna go. While I'm gone,
pull up the Mendez file,
and see what previous motions
the plaintiff has put
before the judge, okay?
Yeah... I love this!
Gonna use it on my car right now.
Okay...
Go get her!
I'll be right here.
And just breathe.
Good.
Everyone, thank you for joining me today
in a journey of
self-discovery and reflection.
Oh, you came.
How nice.
Everyone, we have some new faces today.
Welcome. Namaste.
Namaste.
Can I get an “ohm”?
Okay.
So, let's start in a gentle stretch.
Breathe in.
And out.
Good, now let's move into
our first Vinyasa flow.
And breathe in.
And exhale on an ah...
Ah!
ALL: Ah...
We are in a yoga class
Now is the time to
let your mind go blank
And focus instead on how awesome
The yoga teacher is
Look at me, look at me
I'm so good at yoga
Look at me, look at me
I'm so good at yoga
Exhale on another sigh
I do stuff with my body
That no human should be able to do
Like putting my
face behind my knees
Turning my hand into a shoe
As the morning sun kisses a lotus
I kiss my own hoo-ha...
Can you do that?
Great each day “Namaste”
Screw... you
You're fat
Look at me, look at me
I'm so good at yoga
Look at me, look at me
I'm so good at yoga
I'm so much better than you
If you want to just stay in child's pose,
it's totally fine.
Nope, I'm an adult!
I'm not afraid to get tattoos
-  And they are all in Sanskrit
-  Panther
Butt stuff doesn't hurt at all
Most times I prefer it
That's what this tattoo says
-  I'm so good at yoga
-  Look at her, look at her
I orgasm instantly
I'm not afraid of clowns and trains
- Come on!
-  Look at her, look at her
My father didn't leave me
Nyah, Nyah, Nyah, Nyah, Nyah,
Nyah, Nyah, Nyah, Nyah, Nyah
-  N-N-N-N-N-Nyah
-  Boom!
Nyah, Nyah, Nyah, Nyah, Nyah,
Nyah, Nyah, Nyah, Nyah, Nyah
I'm so good at yoga
Nyah, Nyah, Nyah, Nyah, Nyah,
Nyah, Nyah, Nyah, Nyah, Nyah
-  N-N-N-N-N-Nyah
-  Boom!
REBECCA: Wow!
Um, that was, like, amazing.
Yeah, you are really sweating.
I think you really cleared out some toxins.
I can see those heavy metals
just pouring out of you.
Heavy metals, yeah.
Well, I do eat a lot of auto parts.
Huh?
Nothing, it's stupid.
I'm stupid.
Hey, do you want to go
grab, like, a coffee with me
or something?
I only drink water.
And I got to go do some cardio.
It's hard to break a sweat
doing beginner's yoga.
Of... yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, maybe another time.
Well, no worries.
'Cause I'm just gonna keep coming back.
Um, I bought a 20-pack on my way in,
so I'm kind of your sugar mama
if you know what I'm saying.
Yeah, I wish.
I only get to keep 50% of each class.
But until I own my own
studio, I can't complain.
Well, your own studio. I mean, that's,
that's a great idea. Have
you looked into stuff yet?
Because I-I'm actually, I'm a lawyer
and real estate is my specialty.
And I could help you find a cheap place,
get a good deal on a lease.
Why would you want to do that?
Well, that's why I moved here...
To support a local community.
And building small businesses
is an essential part of that.
Wow, did you, like, go
to Harvard or something?
Um, yeah, but I don't
like to talk about it,
'cause people get weird.
Your shirt says Harvard.
That way I don't have to talk about it.
Hmm, wow. That's... impressive.
Hey! Oh, mmm!
This just popped into my nogs.
Why don't we get lunch sometime this week,
and I'll just, I'll go over
all the deets about leases
and how it works.
And I can buy you a really nice water.
Okay.
I like boxed water.
Great.
PAULA: So...
have a nice lunch with Valerio.
Who knows, maybe next time,
you'll actually have lunch with Josh.
Uh, okay, again, this
is not because of Josh.
Who's that?
Josh!
JOSH: Hey!
Hi!
Sorry.
Hi, um, so you wanted to see me?
Oh, before we go talk,
do you want some boba?
It actually horrifies me personally.
It's like drinking little tumors.
But if you want some,
like, knock yourself out.
No, I'm good, I'm good.
So, listen, uh, I've
been scratching my head
a little bit here, 'cause I heard
you were having lunch with Valencia?
And I thought you were
gonna keep a little distance?
Yeah, um, the friendship thing.
I know that we talked about that.
But it just kind of,
it happened organically.
You know?
I won't say a word about camp.
Oh, my God, like,
I don't even factor that whole
thing into our friendship.
I honestly, I barely remember it.
I mean, I've had many
sexual partners since.
Clean as a whistle, though.
I don't know.
Uh, uh, she can get mad.
She can, you know,
get really mad.
But what's there to be mad about?
Because if we're just
gonna be buds, that's all.
And the great thing is, if we're friends,
then we can all hang out
and it won't be awkward.
Right? We could have lunches
and dinners and go to Spiders.
Find out if it's possessive or plural.
Right?
Thank you for letting me
order off the children's menu.
You're so nice.
This looks so good.
So I really think we're gonna
get the property on East Cameron.
You think so?
It would be so perfect.
The square footage is exactly what I need.
But it was so expensive.
And you low-balled the guy.
No, no. By the end of lunch,
that guy's gonna call and cave.
So, um,
go back to what you were
saying about your diet,
- 'cause it was, it was fascinating.
- Oh, yeah.
So, I sent my wellness
coach a drop of my blood,
and she told me which foods
go best with my blood type.
So it's lots and lots of greens
and lean proteins and no legumes.
You know, I-I sent a drop of blood
to a wellness coach one time,
and they said that my blood type
works best with Panda Express.
- Really?
- No. No, it doesn't.
Oh, you were making a joke.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh.
Yeah, I think you did that once before.
Sorry, I don't like humor.
Okay.
Um, I've been meaning to ask you.
What kind of face moisturizer do you use?
'Cause my face has been
dry for, like, 20 years.
Unrefined coconut oil.
- Really?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.
So, anyway, something else
my wellness coach said was...
Actually don't do the oil
pulling for 20 minutes...
Silky romper... how do
you pee in that thing?
Hold on.
Hold that very important thought.
We got your yoga studio.
We did? Yeah.
Oh, my God, you're amazing.
Oh. Oh, my God.
Hey, you're amazing.
- You smell like roasted corn.
- Huh?
I said you smell like roasted corn.
Oh, thanks.
God, I can't believe you did it.
Well, I went to Harvard.
I don't mess around.
Do all people who go to Harvard
say it as much as you do?
Yeah.
You've checked your phone, like, 80 times.
Why are you so worried
about Valencia having lunch with Rebecca?
Don't know, it just... feels weird.
Why? Did you and Rebecca
hook up or something?
: Um, no, bro,
I was eight years old.
Even I am not that big of a stud.
Hmm. Wait, why?
Are you into Rebecca?
Well...
Is that why you're asking me?
Whoa.
Wow, Serrano, coming from you,
that is like... a declaration of love.
Dude, if you want her, go for it.
Maybe I will.
Maybe I will throw my saddle
- on that filly.
- Yeah.
Take her for a ride around the paddock.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, you're gonna ride that filly.
-
-
Men are disgusting.
Yeah.
Hey, don't worry about
Valencia and Rebecca.
They are not gonna become friends.
You know how Valencia is with other women.
Come on, she's not a bonder.
She can't bond.
I love you.
No, I love you.
Hey, what's-what's wrong?
Uh, it's just, you
wouldn't get this about me
because of my wide student fan base,
but I actually don't
have a lot of girlfriends.
Huh.
The last time I had a solid
crew was in high school,
but then they all got jealous
because I got these amazing boobs
and they were still trolls,
and so they spread all
these rumors that I, like,
slept with the English teacher.
No. I know.
Which is a total lie,
because we only did hand stuff.
And then everyone turned on me,
and since then, I just...
I don't get along that
well with other girls.
Oh, my God, I'm the exact same way.
Yeah? I mean, except for
the English teacher part.
- That's-that's really cool.
- Thanks.
Although, um, it-it's really cool,
but, like, you know, you
should have reported that.
Did you report it to the
appropriate authorities?
Nah, it's just hand
stuff... It's not a big deal.
Well, I mean, depending
on what age you were,
it's technically a little
bit of statutory rape.
Eh... But, you know.
I'll allow it.
But seriously, a judge
would not have allowed it.
He should be in jail.
Do you know if he went to jail?
Did he do it to other kids?
Oh, my God, you're amazing, you're so nice.
I thought you just only wanted
to do real estate stuff with me,
but we're friends.
We're friends, right?
Yeah. Yeah, we're... we're fr...
Yeah, we're friends...
Yeah, we're friends.
Yeah, 'cause, I mean, like,
what other agenda could I possibly have?
That is such a weird thing to say.
: I know!
Aah! Yeah.
Mmm, your tushy's warm.
Thanks.
Valencia and I are
basically the same person.
Oh, she's like me, except for...
I don't know what she is... Guatemalan?
I don't know, don't quote me on that.
Anyway, between us, it's
like we're Siamese souls.
Excuse me, just one second.
Now, uh, in case you missed
it, that was me vomiting.
No, I got it.
What's wrong with you?
'Cause, like, I've made
a really cool friend.
She's, like, pretty and nice,
and she knows about,
like, a lot of cool things,
like coconut oil and
movies and Vampire Weekends.
Like, what's your deal?
We had a plan... uh, neutralize
the enemy, not snuggle it.
No, we didn't have a plan.
You had a plan, I'm making a friend.
- What?!
- Wow.
Are you jealous?
I am not jealous.
I'm not saying this for
me, I'm saying this for you,
you munchkin dumb-ass.
This is unhealthy.
Okay, all right.
You need to take some Motrin or something.
Oh, you know, I have
never met anyone in my life
who lies to themselves as much as you do.
You lie about why you came here,
You lie about how you feel about Josh.
You lie about why you want to
become friends with Valencia.
Okay, okay, that's enough! God!
Let's just do this stupid meeting
with these stupid clients.
Hello, gentlemen.
So we heard most of that.
I'm realizing that now as
I see the horrified looks
on your faces.
I'm so sorry.
Paula and I were just having a
little disagreement out there.
It has nothing to do with you.
It will not happen again.
Let's get down to business,
shall we?
You know that was very
inappropriate what we overheard.
I understand. One sec...
_
Going to Spiders.
Which seems to be possessive plural.
- Oh.
- REBECCA: Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I mention that I got Robertson
to agree to an arbitration next week?
I didn't mention that.
Should have led with that. Sorry.
How did you do that?
Uh, we've been trying to do that for years.
Actually, I threatened
a lawsuit on the grounds
that they were impeding
commercial development,
and that they would be liable
for interest or extra costs.
So, news flash... next week,
you are going to a hearing
that will allow you to... Most likely...
Build the $10 million complex
downtown you have always wanted
in your little heart of hearts,
and I am going to a super cool nightclub.
Oh, I got to go get ready.
I should buy jewelry, I don't have jewelry.
Uh, love your dress.
Oh, um, you too, bitches.
Do you want to take a selfie?
Yeah.
Okay, all right, one, two, three.
_
What?
MAN: Uh, Mom, I stabbed Tommy.
Uh, kind of.
Brendan, I told you I had to work late.
But, uh, he's sort of bleeding.
Okay, you know what, figure it out.
Yeah.
-
-
It's hugging my throat.
Don't you just love her, Joshy?
Don't you just want to put her
in a bowl with chocolate sauce and eat her?
Uh, uh, I thought we
were off sugar, Valencia.
Oh, you're funny.
I'm starting to like humor.
Come on, dance with me, Joshy.
I want to see you work that thang.
What's up with your
resting Maggie Smith face?
What?
What is this?
This? This is called a metallic mini.
No, the thing where you
copy another girl's outfit.
What are you up to, you duplicitous minx?
I'm not copying her.
I'm just heavily influenced by her,
like... like how Picasso was
influenced by early portraiture
before he created the Cubist movement.
You went to Harvard... We get it.
Anyway, can I get you a drink?
Um...
How many bras are you wearing, by the way?
Come on, you
crazy kids, let's dance.
Okay. Come on.
Okay.
Whoa, you clean up good.
Oh, thanks.
I'm just gonna go dance
with my friend, though, so...
Hey, whatever happened
with you and your ex?
Uh, I saw him over there.
It's the buff Asian dude, right?
Ex?
No, he's not my ex.
I... I was just talk...
I was just talking...
Oh, you're still bummed
he's with that other girl.
Don't worry.
You'll get him, kid.
Hey, I'll see you at the market.
Oh, next week we're having
a sale on clementines.
It's gonna be tight!
Wait a second.
You and Josh dated?
Okay, so nobody knows.
Well, that guy knows.
I am so stupid.
It all makes sense now...
Everything, all of it.
- When did you date? In New York?
- It's complicated.
No, something
with you is complicated?
- VALENCIA: Rebecca!
- Oh, my God.
Just please... just
please don't say anything.
Please, please, please,
please don't say anything.
Please, please, please, please.
Why so serious?
Come on, dance with Greg.
Dance with Greg.
Get away from me.
She-she wants me to dance with you.
You do everything she says?
No.
: Hi.
Ooh, oh.
Hey, cutie, don't know if you knew
But I've kind of got
a girl crush on you
You're everything
that I wish I could be
Gonna tell you what I want
to do to you, tee hee hee
I want to lock you in a
basement with soundproof walls
And take over your identity
I want to cut the silky
hair right off your head
And slurp it up like spaghetti
Want to clone you and consume you
Want to own you and cartoon you
Fly your dirty panties like a kite
Kite
'Cause
I-I-I-I
Sorry I said that
creepy stuff out loud
That was super rando
I meant to say I want
to do cutesy stuff
Like pillow fight or
go swimming commando
I want to kill you and
wear your skin like a dress
But then also have
you see me in the dress
And be like, “O-M-G, you
look so cute in my skin”
I want to lock you in a basement
But in that basement you would
also be my personal trainer
I want your abs
Break into your mom's house,
collect your baby teeth
And turn them into my new retainer
I want your smile
Cook your spit into a chowder
Dry your sweat into a powder
And do lines of you
all through the night
Night
'Cause
I-I-I-I-I-I-I
I'm feeling kind of naughty
Take measurements of your body
Then go up to a surgeon
Make my body like your body
Like that film with Liberace
'Cause I'm feeling
kind of naughty tonight.
Wait, wait.
Oh!
Are you crazy?!
What is wrong with you?!
We were just being cute!
Cute kissing.
For attention.
Are you stupid, Harvard?
Oh, this is why I can't
be friends with women!
Why does everyone want
to have sex with me?!
Okay, so, Valencia, Valencia?
It's all good, okay?
It's just, it's just
there's so much love here.
Just back off, okay?
I-I think we should call it a night.
- You think?
- Hey, shh, come on.
No, I-I just want to apologize!
I want to talk to you...
The reason why, the reason
with her... Valencia?
See, okay, it all makes sense,
because it's a circle of love.
Because I love you.
You love Josh.
And Josh and I used to love each other.
What is this drunk bitch talking about?
REBECCA: Um...
so I'd like to start by saying
that it was nothing.
What... is... she...
talking about?!
Um...
um...
Do you remember that summer
between 11th and 12th grade
when, uh, I went to camp...
and we were technically on a break?
It was, it was eons ago!
Right? It was eons ago!
It meant nothing!
It was just two young bucks
sharing two months of summer love.
It was a moment of connection.
And isn't that what yoga's all about?
Why did you lie to me?
B-Because he...
I-I was afraid. I was afraid.
I was afraid, okay?!
I was afraid.
I don't know what you're trying to do
or why you pretended to be my friend,
but stay away from me
and my Josh.
Are you okay?
No.
Let me go out on a limb and say
telling the truth from the beginning
probably would've been
the better option here?
You're right.
I messed everything up.
Thank you for pointing it out.
Is this what you wanted?
You're right.
I'm hungry.
You want to go to a diner?
Maybe get a cup of coffee?
You could use a cup of
coffee, some flapjacks.
Just... I...
Stop being nice to me, okay?
Great to see you, Mr. Spiders!
Well, at least that's been cleared up.
It's not Christmas!
Well, I just like the song.
Where's Rebecca?
I usually see you two at
break enjoying your Luna Bars.
Who cares? I don't care about her.
She talks too much.
Well, I don't know about that.
But she does always
eat the Lemon Zest bars,
before I can get my mitts on them, mmm.
You know Luna Bars are for women, right?
Oh, I did not.
Yeah, I think they have,
like, menstrual blood in them.
Stop that.
No, they don't.
Oof!
It's a long story.
Can I get the number for
Luna Bars customer service?
I feel like I've lost her.
I know I still have you.
But you have your rugby friends now.
What should I do?
Hey.
Hey.
Oh!
Munchkin.
God, I am so sorry.
I'm such a bad friend.
You're the only person that I can trust.
You know why? You're a true friend.
Because a true friend
is somebody who loves you
no matter what.
Even if your Downward Dog is horrible.
: Oh, come here.
Oh, you guys.
Ow, not you, Darryl! Get off!
You know, that's not true about Luna Bars.
Talked to the customer service.
They were very nice.
So, my client, Mr. Mendez,
will drop his counter-suit
and will reimburse Mr. Robertson
for all of his relocation fees
for the entire duration of construction.
Also, he will provide a free lease
on a floor-through space
for a period of 18 months.
Hmm, Ms. Bunch,
your arguments are...
persuasive.
I rule in your favor, Mr. Mendez.
You are free to build on that lot,
pending the usual
approvals and inspections.
Thank you.
Ah!
I have been trying to settle
this case for ten years.
Uh, yeah, I think you
mentioned that once or twice.
This is what she did for you her
first week of working for you.
Imagine what she's gonna do next week.
Yes! Yes!
- Yes!
- Let's go.
- Go drink, gentlemen.
- Yes! Ha-ha!
Thank you, thank you.
You're welcome.
Oh, my God!
- Well done!
- Bang! Bang! Bang!
Oh! Oh, guess what.
What? I got something for you.
Oh, Paula, another present?
Come on, you don't have to do that.
Don't move.
I got these...
for your feud with Valencia.
So, you know,
if it ever becomes a feud again,
we'll have these handy.
Paula, that's really sweet.
Thank you.
I just want you to know
that if you ever need it,
this... T-shirt will
always be there for you.
I know, thank you.
Okay.
And I'm here.
The-the
T-shirt is me.
- Which you got that.
- Yeah, I get it.
I don't know why
I felt the need to explain that to...
Hi, excuse me.
Um, I'm here to see Rebecca Bunch.
Is she here?
Hi.
Hi, do you have a second?
Uh, yeah, I have a second.
I have two seconds.
How many...  seconds do you need?
Let's take all the seconds.
Okay. Let's go...
This is my good luck room!
Let's go in my good luck room.
You know why it's my good luck room?
I just actually won,
like, a big case in here.
Like, literally seconds
ago, I won a huge case. Wow.
Yeah. This place is sweet!
Yeah, yeah, it's...
Why are you here? Why are... ?
Not, like, why are you
here? Why are you here?
Uh, I've been thinking about it a lot,
and I realize...
I shouldn't have asked you to lie.
The-the crazy stuff that
happened last night, it was
all my fault in a way,
because of the lying.
No, no. Some of it was my fault, too.
I mean, sticking my tongue
down your girlfriend's throat
kind of crossed a line.
Right?
Well, anyway, uh, I'd
like to make it up to you.
So I was thinking you want
to grab that dinner tonight?
Um...
yeah.
That sounds great.
- Mmm, mmm!
- So good.
- Right?
- Mmm!
- This place is awesome.
- I know.
Do you come here a lot?
Well, nah, it's a little far.
I was gonna say I drove,
like, 45 minutes to get here.
Yeah.
Does Valencia know we're
hanging out tonight?
Uh, no, she says she doesn't want me
to see you ever again.
So this is probably the last time
we can have dinner.
Well, we'll see about that.
: Yeah.
We'll see about that.
Welcome, everyone,
to Vampire Weekend.
For those of you who would
like to go water-skiing,
there will be a tutorial
at 2:00... a.m.
You see?
