The story is set
in Paris around 1 930
I don't mind being kept awake,
but at least tell me
why you're all so merry.
You haven't heard!
They haven't heard!
They haven't heard the events
So we'll tell the story to you.
You may think it all nonsense
Though every word is true.
Can you give us an explanation?
You want an explanation? Very well.
We'd be happy to relate
the whole story
Since everything here
is now hunky-dory
But to explain
how it all came to pass
Father Time would have
to change his way.
So be patient
and have yourselves a glass
And let's go back to early today.
So be patient
and have yourselves a glass
And let's go back to early today.
And let's go back to early today.
Leave us alone, pal.
Shut up, you fool.
What is it...
What do you want, Beatrice?
Nothing. Nothing.
I didn't mean to disturb you.
Excuse me.
That girl seemed annoyed.
Is she your girlfriend?
No, she's a neighbor.
She's a dancer. She's quite nice.
But she didn't know I was doing
your portrait. It surprised her.
You're probably wooing her.
Not at all.
We're just sort of engaged.
Why do you bother with Michel?
You always run after him.
You love him.
Well, that's your business.
You always wait on him.
I promised to mend his old jacket.
I was bringing it back.
It's too old to mend.
Anyway, I've had enough.
Sure, he's a nice fella.
He's my friend.
I can't badmouth him. But still...
He's short, not good-looking,
and he has a big nose.
But you're so soft on him.
Me, soft on him?
- Who is it?
- The butcher.
The gentleman's not in.
Oh, no? Then just tell him
if he doesn't pay his bill today
he'll have to answer to me.
I'm wise to people's tricks
when they're flat broke.
When you can't pay,
you don't go shopping. Thief!
Him, a thief?
Don't give me that!
You're the one who owes me.
How can you accept that?
Ignore him. He'll go away.
Forget your floozies and find a job.
Bum! Good-for-nothing!
If you don't like it, come on out.
Loafer!
I'll have your furniture impounded.
It's better not to answer
people like that back.
Why don't you just pay the man?
Because I'm hard up right now.
But not for long.
I'm expecting some money.
How annoying.
It's the third time we've been
interrupted since I arrived.
No way to see the fellow.
They're awful people,
these artists, these doodlers!
He owes me 2 months.
And 2 months' rent!
Let me get my hands on him.
I was just upstairs.
He wouldn't open the door.
Same here.
Don't worry. We'll have
his furniture impounded tomorrow.
I'll be here with this gentleman.
We'll impound.
Enough is enough.
This has gone on too long.
Going, Wanda dear?
Look at how you're dressed!
Relax, I'm the boss now.
Here, pal...
Why the get-up?
Because it's your turn.
Why should I play the servant alone?
Get off my back. Wait a minute.
Close your door
when you entertain your mistresses.
But Beatrice...
You let her insult me!
No, Wanda, don't go.
You're being ridiculous, Beatrice!
Wanda, listen!
I'm sorry, dear.
I'll finish your portrait tomorrow.
You'd do better
to pay the milk maid.
Quiet, you old bat!
Scoundrel!
Murderer! Artist!
So there you are!
And now, young man,
you can pay my bill.
And mine.
You owe me, too.
And my bill.
Enough, gentlemen!
I don't settle bills in stairwells.
There's a lady present.
Your business doesn't concern me.
I'll leave you to your friends.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, my dear.
Good day, gentlemen.
That's enough!
I won't stand
for your penny-pinching manners.
The nerve!
Penny-pinching manners, us?
- Stop, thief!
- He's on the run.
- Stop, thief!
- Catch that one.
He went that way,
he'll come this way
Stop, thief!
Stop that man, I say!
What are you doing here?
Please, young lady, not a word.
You come into my room,
take that jacket...
Young lady, let me ask you
one question. Just one.
Do you enjoy the piano?
- What?
- I can tell you do. Come here.
Who's after you?
Are you in debt, too?
Why are they after you?
Listen, child, you've just done me
a great, great service.
If ever you need a helping hand,
count on me.
Grandpa Tulip.
Are you done playing?
Why?
I have to run out the door.
Then I won't keep you.
Would you mind
if I kept the jacket?
But it's not mine.
It's worthless.
Let go!
Will you let go of me!
- I'll put the cuffs on you.
- Leave him to us.
Let go!
You're hurting me!
- He's not our man.
- He's not?
What d'you want?
Will you pay us?
Will you pay us?
Will you pay?
We'll count to three.
We'll count to three.
One...
Two...
Three...
Yes!
What's got into you?
Read this.
One of us is a millionaire.
- Millionaire?
- That's right, fella...
- What's the matter?
- Look.
NO. 27 009 WlNS
The Dutch Lottery!
We bought tickets.
Who won, you or me?
The tickets!
What's this nonsense?
Is it you? Or me?
Listen, please!
The tickets!
You noted the numbers.
My notebook.
Is it you? Is it me?
Answer me, dummy!
I don't know. Take a look.
Let's make a deal. Whether
it's you or me, we split it, okay?
No way, old man.
If it's me, I keep it all.
See how he is?
This joke's gone far enough.
You'll see.
- Split or no split?
- Not a cent.
Okay.
Well?
Dammit!
It's me. Say, what's a million
florins come out to?
It comes out to... Iots of millions.
I don't know how much.
Imagine that! Imagine that!
This is terrific! Aren't you glad?
You'll all be paid tomorrow.
How do we know
you have this ticket?
A good point.
Come with me. You'll see.
Gladly.
Upwards, upwards,
to the light up there.
We'll see if his claim is true
If the painter is really
a millionaire.
The baker...
The butcher...
The grocer...
The dairy maid...
We shall bear witness to his virtue.
Do you remember
where I put the ticket?
No, I don't, old man.
What a dope! Beatrice has it.
Darn! She's out!
Stay here, old man.
Watch the door till she gets back.
My fortune's in this room.
I can't show you the ticket now.
It's in there, all right,
but it's locked. I have to wait.
Look, we'll come back later.
No. I insist on showing it to you.
You'll see it soon enough.
Some port, gentlemen!
Don't worrry.
I'll go fetch a bottle.
Bring a dozen, while you're at it.
A dozen? All right.
And some pastries.
And champagne.
And then...
I'll leave it up to you.
So long as it's quality stuff.
Have no fear. I'll be right back.
Gentlemen, please, take a seat.
Millionaire! Millionaire!
Who?
That beggar, that bohemian?
The fellow in the studio.
The one who's behind in his rent.
He's become a...
Millionaire!
The one who never pays?
What a lucky fellow!
He'll be paying me now.
Sure, it's easy when you're a...
Millionaire!
The million's been won!
Get your lottery results!
Who? Michel? He won what?
Enough money to burn.
Gentlemen, to his health!
Miss, you're needed at home.
It's urgent. Come with me.
What for?
Dunno. They just sent me.
What happened?
You can run along.
I'm parked just outside.
Is Michel here?
Police.
- Where?
- That fellow.
- You sure?
- I think so.
What do you want?
Why... nothing.
What are you doing here?
I came to...
Who are you?
Who am l?
I am Ambrosio Sopranelli.
Tenor at the New York Met.
Tenor?
Prove it.
Sing!
Don't shoot. I'll sing.
Do you sense the courage
That now sustains my arm?
Do you see my visage
Which betrays no alarm?
O angel mine,
All danger I shall decline.
O angel mine!
Goodbye, Michel.
Goodbye, my love.
Michel, here comes Beatrice.
Quick! Open up!
- What is it?
- I'm a millionaire.
- He's gone crazy.
- He's right.
Open up, quick!
My million's inside, you know.
The jacket, Beatrice. The jacket.
Yes, the jacket.
What for?
My lottery ticket's in it.
Oh, my God! I don't have it.
You don't have it?
Where did it go?
Here you are, and thank you.
And if you want to hear me...
I'm at the Opera Lyrique.
You forgot your cane, sir.
Why return his cane?
To pinch his watch.
They were chasing him, you see...
I gave him the jacket...
so they wouldn't recognize him.
I don't know...
it was an old, beat-up jacket...
I didn't think...
You didn't think, you didn't think.
Don't think.
No mistake about it.
It's gone for good.
Go on, fella.
Don't panic.
You can't tell them what happened.
Go out there.
Put on a happy face, and laugh.
Fake it. Go on.
In the name of all the tenants here,
so proud to know a millionaire,
accept this bouquet of flowers
and may your happiness be ours.
Didn't the man who took the jacket
leave a name or address?
Yes, but I forgot it.
There was so much confusion...
But I think... it was like
the name of a flower.
Something like Grandpa Rose.
Grandpa Tulip.
I'm sure of it.
And his address?
The address, I don't know.
A smile, sir. More.
Tilt your head a bit...
The bouquet...
That's it.
Imagine, this picture will be
in all the papers tomorrow.
Smile. More, more.
Just a little bit...
Smile a bit more. To the right.
Hold it right there. Smile.
That's it.
It didn't come out. Sorry, sir.
But isn't there a way
to find his address?
Tough luck.
Grandpa Tulip should be enough.
It should be easy
to find a Tulip in Paris.
Look, I'm going to give
Michel a hand.
Wait a minute...
Smile. Smile.
That's it.
Does she have any clues?
No, nothing.
No, no. This can't be!
Look here, I want to do
something for you.
I have some contacts. If I find
the ticket, do we split it?
Split it? No, we don't split it.
Then go look for your ticket.
If you call that friendship...
Why did you ask?
It was just a hunch I had.
Oh, why not!
I have nothing to lose now.
It's a deal?
However I manage,
if I bring you the ticket,
we split the million.
It's a deal.
Word of honor?
Then you're on, pal.
Don't hold your breath.
Tulip...
I'm so sorry.
And we needed the money
to get married.
That's out of the question now.
Why?
Forgot already? I'll never forget.
But you'll find your million.
Oh, so what.
I remembered the thief's name.
I told Prosper.
He went off to find him.
Prosper? The bastard!
So that's it.
What's the name?
Grandpa Tulip.
Oh, why bother!
I'm not going to start chasing
after this Tulip fellow.
That's Grandpa Tulip's address.
Good heavens!
We are the foot soldiers
of inequality
We take back the spoils
of social injustice
And under the watchful eye
of the police...
...watchful eye of the police
We redistribute wealth
and private property.
At ease.
Gentlemen,
I almost got arrested today.
The police are on our trail.
We must be careful.
Anyone on guard outside?
Yes. Young Laborde.
Good. Let's get to work.
Are you Grandpa Tulip?
What can I do for you?
I'm Michel Bouflette.
The owner of the jacket.
What jacket?
The jacket a young lady
lent you this morning,
when you were in bad straits.
I'm here for the jacket
you borrowed from me.
But it was worthless.
This man was wearing
a superb jacket.
I followed him in the street,
I went into his shop
and bought the jacket.
A great artist must pay attention
to the slightest details.
I'm all set to sing "The Bohemians"
in this costume.
Alone are we,
O beloved!
My watch! My watch chain!
But why sell the jacket to a singer
who's going to America?
How should I know?
He said it was for a role.
A role?
Do you know his name?
We bought his watch.
So what if you did?
It may have his name inside.
Exactly.
The watch, son.
Good idea.
You're Crochard, alias The Tulip.
Me?
Who's watch is that?
Just what I'd like to know.
Don't get funny with me, buster!
Take him away.
We are the foot soldiers of legality
No bandit can escape the police
Our arm upholds
the scales ofjustice
In the name of public virtue
and private property.
Gentlemen, this jacket business
looks very suspect to me.
I sell it to a singer,
and another man comes
to get it back,
upon which we get a police raid.
So tonight we go
to the Opera Lyrique
and we get that jacket.
Michel, Michel,
how can you sit there?
When will you be a millionaire?
You won't stop the clock by whining
The meter's running,
the price is climbing!
Victory was there for you to hold
Somewhere yourjacket's flying
With a pocketful of gold
Mr. Prosper Benevant?
Report to the station.
Why?
They arrested a man
who claims to know you.
He lost his papers.
We need you to identify him.
I'll be right down.
Ambrosio Sopranelli.
Ambrosio... Sopa...
Sopranelli. The singer.
I'm singing tonight
at the Opera Lyrique.
I'm off to America
to sing my repertoire.
Repert...
Carmen, Paillasse, Rigoletto.
That watch meant a lot to me.
I'm sure Grandpa Tulip stole it.
The police does its job.
Here's your watch.
And here's Grandpa Tulip.
- Is this yours?
- lndeed it is.
So you bought my jacket.
The one Grandpa Tulip wore.
But it's mine.
So you admit
to being Grandpa Tulip.
No, no. But this man...
Are you or aren't you
Grandpa Tulip?
Then be quiet.
Be quiet.
No, I'm trying to explain...
It's important to me.
Excuse me,
but the watch is mine.
The jacket is mine.
Everything is mine.
The jacket's mine.
Take them away.
My jacket! Let go!
My jacket!
Don't let it get away!
May I go?
Sit down.
Prosper, quick!
The guy there. Sopranelli. He sings
at the Opera Lyrique tonight.
He's got the jacket. Go get it.
At the Opera Lyrique.
What is it?
Sir, here's the person
for the interrogation.
Fine. Go fetch this Tulip fellow.
Just a moment, sir.
It's all right.
So, sir...
Will you release my fare?
Wait outside.
Wait, wait...
And the meter's running...
I can't help you.
Can I go now?
Sit down, you!
Do you know this gentleman?
Me?
Not at all.
Is this a joke?
I never saw him before.
Never saw me before?
Sure, I saw him a moment ago
when he was making a fuss...
It's the first time I saw him.
He's known me for over 20 years.
That's a lie. I don't know him.
You don't know me?
You don't know me?
No, I don't know him.
No one asked you.
- Can I go now?
- Sit down.
Hey, you, do you realize
what you're doing?
You bet, I do.
Why are you doing this?
Can't you guess?
No, I can't.
This morning you said
we'd share the million
if I found the ticket.
This way I'm sure to get it.
As promised.
I'm going to break your neck.
I'm going to break your neck,
you hear!
Don't forget your hat.
You louse! You gangster!
You bastard! You'll pay for this.
Can I go, sir?
You're free to go.
Prosper, what have you done?
Prosper, what have you done?
As a friend, you're no paragon
Let your conscience confess
That your friend is in distress
Prosper, what have you done?
Best not to give another thought
To the remorse your acts brought
Don 't let it get the better of you
Instead of trying to make amends
Go spend a moment or two
With a charming lady friend
I don't understand this.
So you'll get the million?
The thing is...
Not quite.
It's like this: Michel and l
each have a claim on the ticket.
But Michel's in trouble,
so he'll get whatever I give him.
It all depends on
how generous I want to be.
Then you're a rich man.
Yes... not yet...
but very soon I will be.
I'm so happy...
for you.
Prosper, how can you dare?
Let the voice of virtue declare
See your friend, see his state
The jacket's gone, the hour's late,
The proud fighter has not a prayer
Prosper, how can you dare?
It's him!
This is Michel Bouflette?
You'll vouch for him?
So swear we, he's the millionaire.
This is Michel. Yes, it is.
So swear we.
So swear we, Mister Commissioner.
No law can make us forswear.
We, his friends, shall set him free.
So swear we, so swear we.
So swear we, Mister Commissioner.
This is Michel. Yes, it is.
So swear we.
It's about time.
You have to pay up.
That's enough!
Wait at my place
while I run over
to the Opera Lyrique.
Not me. I want my money.
If you want your money,
you have to drive me.
I'm not used to working this way.
I can't buy gas with promises.
- It's for the bouquet.
- Just a second.
Get out, sir! I've had enough
of this jacket business.
Just when I'm about to sing.
- But I only wanted to ask...
- Get out of here!
When would you like these ladies
to throw you the bouquet?
At the end of Act One,
after the love duet.
Make sure it's in my direction.
Did you understand?
You can count on us.
So, you're one
of my greatest admirers?
Oh, yes.
You're so handsome in that costume.
Wait until you see me with my beard.
Look.
Tell me, child,
why don't we speak
after the performance?
Come to my dressing room
after the final curtain.
Oh, certainly, Maestro.
Nothing could make me happier.
See you later.
What is it, child?
Nothing.
I just wanted to see you.
How sweet.
You're in the ballet?
Yes, I'm dancing.
I've heard you sing so often.
Then you'll be delighted
to hear me on stage.
You're so charming.
Would you mind if I watch you
put on your makeup?
Well... of course, take a seat.
She's irresistible.
You have such a nice voice.
You haven't heard anything yet.
Just wait...
Oh, yes, I know.
But it's still so pleasant.
She's so charming.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Would you pass me
the jacket there, child?
Here. Here.
Thank you.
Isn't she adorable!
Will you come see me
after the performance?
Who is it?
- On stage.
- Coming.
They're waiting.
Coming. So you'll come?
Coming?
Excuse me, I'll be right there.
Until later.
- Did you get the ticket?
- I couldn't.
Why not?
Someone was with him.
I saw the jacket.
Hello, Michel.
Working for Prosper now?
- Not at all.
- Nice work.
- But I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
Let me explain.
There's nothing to explain.
I get the picture.
Who are you? Thief!
Let me out of here!
Stop him!
Don't let him get away!
I might be her brother!
I might be her father!
- What are we waiting for?
- Madame Ravellina.
I won't be kept waiting.
That's not the costume!
That's the "Bohemian" costume.
But we start with the love duet.
That's right.
No one told me.
On stage, madame.
We're locked in!
Let us out!
Let me go!
On stage!
Quick! Quick!
Now it's my turn!
I refuse to change.
What are you doing backstage?
But you can't!
The public's waited long enough.
Because of her.
What?
Sopranelli waits for no one.
I won't stand for criticism.
- But your costume!
- I don't care!
- What will the audience think?
Leave them to me.
He's mad.
The management will hear of this.
Alone are we at last tonight
All else to their slumbers
have gone
Alone are we
in the failing light
Side by side
upon this bench of stone
We are free at last to speak openly
Far from the crowds,
the city's blare
Far from the world and its agony
Truth is what we find here
What sorrow clouds thy sense?
O heart, what is my offense?
O pity, see how I grieve
Yes, great is my adversity
There is no balm, no reprieve
Thou lovest me not,
I who love thee
Heed not thy jealous heart
Nothing shall keep us apart
We are alone in the forest
This blessed place is our shrine
Let your hand in my hand rest
And our fingers forever entwine
I lack the force to resist thy pleas
I feel so weak when thou art near
Let me gaze into thine eyes
Let thy love be all most dear
Let us forget sorrows past
Let us sad thoughts outcast
Let the Spring now sow its pedals
In the furrows of thy hair
Our pain shan 't our love unsettle
The breeze on this night so fair
Carries off our coupled sighs
Far away toward distant skies
In the forest deep are we alone
What care we of fortune's sting?
When Heaven to us opens its throne
Pure gold do the moonbeams bring
When the Earth is graced
from up Above
The night is sworn to secrecy
Cradled in eternal love
Alone in the forest are we
Why do you keep stroking
your beard like that?
I believe we've met before, child.
Think hard.
Grandpa Tulip.
Don't count on me
for any more jackets.
The troubles I've had over that!
Look, sir,
you promised to help me.
All I ask is: give me my jacket
back now. I must have it.
You'll have your jacket, child.
There's not a minute to lose.
- Honest?
- Yes, go on.
- You promise?
- I promise.
I'll get it?
Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen...
THE BOHEMlANS
Opera in three acts
Give us the giddiness
Give us the caress
Of a ravishing mistress!
That's our only happiness!
We are alone, O angel mine!
Join me beneath the scented pine.
What sight do my eyes take in?
What! Laurence in this place of sin?
Impure girl, get thee hence
Or my wrath shall chastise thee!
I laugh at your violence!
She laughs at his violence!
They fight! Make haste!
They are crimson-faced!
Anger takes its toll.
We must keep them apart.
Assassin of my heart!
Ravisher of my soul!
Mother, thy face I descry.
Son, I hear thee cry.
I die.
You die.
He dies.
O tragic demise!
Heavens, he is dead.
What is this I hearest?
Laurence, hear me now.
Hear me now, my dearest.
Now even the stars do bemoan
This life by my hand bereft.
Of my last friends, none are left...
But what care I for remorse
When I love thee.
Thou lovest me!
Till death do us part!
You again! What do you take me for?
I told you to move on.
I've been around the block
a dozen times.
I'm waiting for my fare to come out.
He's got to pay me.
Here he comes now.
Next time I'll hit you
with a ticket.
Where to now? The police station?
Not the station. You can spend
your life there. Home!
Home? Where's home?
You were waiting there this morning.
Will I get paid this time?
Sure, sure, you'll get paid.
- It's about time.
- You tire me out.
I tire you?
I just want what's coming to me.
Michel, Michel,
how can you sit there?
The meter's running,
the price is climbing.
With a pocketful of gold.
The jacket!
It was on the roof.
That's great!
Not a word! Not a move!
Shut up!
- This can't be!
- Don't, Michel, stay here!
After them, you idiot!
They're getting away.
After them? That's a good one.
And stop a bullet?
No. Pay the fare and that's that.
Goodbye and good riddance.
Or else I'll take you to the cops.
There are too many guys like you.
Risk my life for an honest living?
I've got a wife and I might have
kids some day. I'm a future father.
If you don't want to pay, say so.
I'll take you to the cops.
I heard you. Thanks.
No, you didn't hear.
I cooled my heels...
- I haven't a cent on me.
- Then don't take taxis.
Look for yourself.
"Look for yourself."
Where?
Come in, ladies and gentlemen.
Give us the giddiness
Give us the caress
Of a ravishing mistress!
You ought to be glad.
We did things right.
That's for sure.
Tell me, are all these folks
creditors?
Not all of them. They're neighbors.
They brought friends to see you.
How nice of them!
Driver, have a glass of champagne
and some cake.
Sure.
Say, mister...
Who's this fellow I've been driving?
He's flat broke.
Who's paying for this?
What a question! You are.
- Me!
- It's natural.
So it's me.
- Aren't you glad?
- Sure I am.
That's more like it.
A million?
Then why wouldn't he pay his fare?
He didn't have
his lottery ticket then.
But he has it now.
We should ask to see it.
Sure. You'll see.
Do you have the ticket?
That's just what I was saying...
- Well then...
- Come on.
- Don't keep us waiting.
- Let's see it.
What?
The lottery ticket.
The million.
Oh, you want to see the...
Well, then, I'll show you the...
Your attention...
Gentlemen, I have some news.
Some bad news.
We aren't always masters
of our fate.
Is Miss Beatrice here?
No, that's enough, please,
leave me alone.
I kept the ticket in a jacket,
and this jacket...
The jacket!
But the jacket's empty!
This is the end. The jacket's empty.
Explain the problem to me.
The ticket was in it.
What ticket?
The lottery ticket.
I was asked
to bring back a jacket...
- It's the ticket I want.
- So I brought a jacket.
The lining!
There was a ticket in the pocket.
What ticket?
The lottery ticket!
Then say so. Had you told me
about a lottery ticket,
I'd have brought you
a lottery ticket.
It would have been easy,
because it's right here.
The ticket that was in the jacket.
I have it. Here it is!
When you haven't got a cent
You're never content,
And life seems unfair.
But your thoughts are gay
When you're young and can say
You're a millionaire.
Money isn 't everything, so beware!
Well that's what folks pretend.
But when you're a millionaire
You're not any worse off
in the end.
Money isn 't everything, so beware!
So say folks who are intelligent
to folks without a cent
We'll believe what they say
When they give
all their money away
And there you have it!
