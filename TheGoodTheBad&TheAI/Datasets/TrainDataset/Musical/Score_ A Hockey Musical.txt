on her colony of ants. ¶

It doesn't ring a bell.
How old are you?
Seventeen.
Who owns your rights?
Sir, there's a little kid
attached to your leg.
And I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.
There's hope we can
domesticate him one day.
So who do you play for?
Nobody.
Never have.
What?
Why not?
My parents don't believe
in team competitions.
What are they,
communists?
They're kind of more
like pacifist-anarchists,
although I'm sure they'd deny
even that categorization.
You mean to tell me
you've never played

hockey in your life?

What's wrong,
Farley?
You've been on
Planet Glum all morning.
Okay.
I want to give
organized hockey a try.
Team sports?
Really?
Maybe my id is
out on a day pass
but it's all
I can think about.
And let me guess.
Your parents think the idea
is more inherently evil
than
genetically-modified food
and organized
religion.
Yeah.
¶
¶ Farley Gordon, you should
always follow your heart. ¶
¶ But everyone knows
that hockey's not art. ¶
¶ I've never been to camp ¶
¶ or even played on a team. ¶
¶ I've never been
away from my parents. ¶
¶ And you're
seventeen. ¶
¶ I'm seventeen. ¶

What if I get bored? ¶

¶ Quit if you find
group sports unworthy. ¶

¶ So you think that
I should join. ¶
¶ Should I give it a shot? ¶
¶ What have you
got to lose? ¶
¶ So why?
So why not? ¶
¶ So I'll join the team
and I'll give it a shot. ¶
¶ So you'll join the team.
So you'll give it a shot. ¶
¶ Yeah,
I'm seventeen. ¶
¶ I might like it a lot. ¶
¶ Yeah,
you're seventeen. ¶
¶ You'll probably
like it a lot. ¶
¶ And by doing so we can ¶

okay?
I'll be back by dinner.
Goodbye,
Farley.
Goodbye.
Love you.
Did you ever play
hockey, Edgar?
¶
Agh!
And since then
I've had a hatred
for all things hockey.
To your left! Get on him!
To your left!
Lookin' good!
Lookin' good!
Hustle, hustle, hustle!
Let's go now!
This is a closed practice.
Well, actually, I'm here
to play on the team.
What?
Excuse me?
Ah, was, I was asked
to join the team.
By who?
"Whom."
It's actually "whom."
It's the object of
the preposition.
I don't care if it's the
ass-end of a 12-point buck.
Answer the question.
Walt Acorn.
You know that
the last nugget
that Walt Acorn
unearthed for me
played in only
one single game.
Why,
what happened to him?
Stopped a slap shot
with his tonsils.
Broke his jaw
in four places.
It's not too late.
Bust that sequined
unitard out of the closet,
sharpen up
those toe picks
and rejoin the
figure skating squad.
Trust me.
They'll welcome you
back with open arms.
I'm here to play hockey.
Oh yeah?
Don't say I
didn't warn you.
This should fit.
Is that right?
Not unless
you're a dick face.
Up against the boards.
Something wrong with
No,
just the...
equipment's a little
uncomfortable.
Don't worry, you won't
be wearing it that long.
Let's see you,

That's cute,

Yeah.
¶
¶
Ugh!
Boom.
Boom. Boom.
Out go the lights.

That's a first.
What happened?
Well, you ran into a brick
I bet they heard
the hit in Mumbai.
Hey!
Hey, boss!
We in the
hardware business?
Sure feels like
I'm getting screwed.
You can't be serious about
letting that kid play.
You saw what he did with the
puck 'til he got flattened.
That won't
happen again.
One game,
regular shifts.
If he's not as good
as I think he is,
do what you want.
Come on, Walt. He's going
to get killed out there.
Last time I checked,
I still own the team.
Pfft...
Farley Gordon.
Ah,
there you are.
Great meeting you,
Now, if you want
any information
on joining
our booster club,
you'll find it on
our web site. Here.
Here's a T-shirt.
Thanks for coming out.
So that's it,
I'm off the team?
Well,
not technically.
But I figured
getting knocked out,
that would be enough to
convince you
that these are very,
very dangerous waters
where all of a sudden
the world starts making
a lot more sense?
Occasionally,
a good bowel movement
will have that effect.
Yeah.
Well..
this might sound
stupid, but...
before Walt Acorn
walked into my life
there was a hole,
a longing that
I couldn't articulate
or, rather,
I didn't even know existed.
But I honestly believe
that organized hockey
might just fill that hole.
¶ What do you weigh,
kid? ¶
¶ A buck fifty-five? ¶
¶ I'm not that vain.
I'm not into my size. ¶
¶ There are other
games that are more ¶
¶ appropriate
for you to play - ¶
¶ Like checkers,
like chess, and croquet. ¶
¶ Well, I've always
been taught ¶
¶ to see things through. ¶
¶ To my heart...
always be true ¶
¶
¶ Hallmark, I'm sure,
would be so proud ¶
¶ to hear you voice those
sentiments out loud. ¶
¶ But a well-played fart
would knock you down. ¶
¶ If The Moose meant harm, ¶
¶ you'd be in
a hospital gown. ¶
¶ This is the toughest
league in the land. ¶
¶ You'll never survive
so become a fan. ¶
¶ Just because I still
have my front teeth, ¶
¶ don't assume
that I can't compete. ¶
¶ Though I might not come
with a hockey pedigree - ¶
¶ Why can't I still
dream of being ¶
¶ the next Crosby? ¶
¶ You never played the game. ¶
¶ No one even knows your name. ¶
¶ Hockey legends
don't happen overnight. ¶
¶ It takes a bunch of years ¶
¶ and a bucketful of tears. ¶
¶ And to put you in
the game is suicide. ¶
I can't kick
you off the team
and I won't protect you.
And when you're
lying in a coma,
don't say
I didn't warn you.
Technically,
if I'm in a coma
I wouldn't
be able to speak.
One game.
Doesn't Mr. Acorn's opinion
count for anything?
I mean, obviously,
he saw something in me
that he thought
worth giving a shot.
He's legally blind
without his glasses.
Yeah.                    No way.
My guess he wasn't wearing
them when he discovered you.
You didn't notice anything
strange about his behaviour?
How long have
you owned a dog?

How was your

I'm just trying to
be a good team mate
and contribute
in any way I can.
The kid speaks athlete
like he's all world!
The hype,
and it is exactly that,
is way overblown.
I mean, I would be thrilled
to make a pro team,
I mean, the only thing
that I can control
is Farley Gordon.
Some critics,
and they
definitely are
in the minority,
suggest that you,
my friend,
might be a little soft.
I don't have one.
I just let my game
do all the talking.
Well,
no comment.
But I will say this,
by tomorrow,
the whole country will know.
It's pretty
tasteful.
¶
Look!
¶
Farley Gordon!
Hey,
easy now.
Everybody will
get their turn.
Man, I love surfing
in your wake.
¶
And, you know,
with each game
the next one is further
cementing his reputation
as the player most likely
to go tops in the draft.
¶
Yeah!
Let's go!
Help a brother out now.
Everybody takes a man!
Mess them up!
¶
¶ drumming ¶
Nice fight there,
peacock.
Do I have the floor?
What?
If I have the floor, I'd
like to defend my pacifism.
It's a decision I came
to after a lot of--
Ha ha!
There's one rule.
When someone is trying
to take your head off,
you don't roll
over on the ice,
cover your ears and
cry like a baby.
You...
hit back!
You...
defend your honour!
Our honour!
At least we were respected
before you arrived.
¶ Forgive me for asking, ¶
¶ for not seeing the light. ¶
¶ not wanting to fight? ¶
¶ It's part of the game. ¶
¶ It's part of the code. ¶
¶ When someone challenges
¶ you go toe-to-toe. ¶
¶
¶ But what does that
have to do with hockey? ¶
¶ I still don't understand. ¶
¶ How do fisticuffs
equate to... ¶
¶
¶ On the ice I've always
had your back. ¶
¶ If they mess with you,
they get a whack. ¶
¶ If that don't
help them comprende ¶
¶ the knuckle sandwich
comes into play. ¶
¶ You see, I drop the gloves
when it's required. ¶
¶ That's the
reason I was hired. ¶
¶ I don't make
fancy passes. ¶
¶ Without me,
most would agree, ¶
¶ The game would
devolve into anarchy. ¶
¶ Devolve? ¶
¶ What does that mean? ¶
¶ A brawler on ice,
I won't lie. ¶
¶ But away from the rink
I'm a sensitive guy. ¶
¶ I'm not afraid to
show a feminine side. ¶
¶ In fact, during
"The Notebook" I cried -- ¶
¶ Twice!
It's pathetic. ¶
¶ But I can't watch out for
someone who won't conform -- ¶
¶ To the code! ¶
¶ To the code! ¶
¶ So stop bending over.
Fight like a man. ¶
¶ Just take one swing
and we'll be a band -- ¶
¶ Of brothers!
Of brothers! ¶
¶ Telling war stories 'til ¶
¶ we're a hundred and three. ¶
¶ But hockey's the game
I love to play. ¶
¶ Is he even
Canadian, eh? ¶
¶ Why does an
anti-violence stand ¶
¶ make me less of a man? ¶
¶ In fact, last time
the doctor checked ¶
¶ my testosterone
was up to spec. ¶
¶
¶ Because we eat, ¶
¶ we play, ¶
¶ we shower together. ¶
¶ We go in the corners. ¶
¶ We'll be friends forever. ¶
¶ And forever. ¶
¶
¶ By refusing to fight, ¶
¶ we can no longer guarantee ¶
¶ that around the ice ¶
¶ you can skate
with impunity. ¶
¶ No one's
expecting you to ¶
¶ punch out
someone's lights. ¶
¶ Just take a
few swings
¶ and it'll be all right. ¶
¶ But until you do, ¶
¶ there's a line
in the sand. ¶
¶ You might be
on the team, ¶
¶ but you aren't a
part of this band... ¶
¶ Of brothers!
Oh,
brothers!
¶ United we'll be
'til eternity ¶
¶ Brothers!
Oh, brothers! ¶
¶ Telling war stories 'til ¶
¶ we're a hundred and three. ¶
¶
Look, I don't like the fighting
...but that's not
why I play the game.
Farley, that's
like saying
the KKK are a
swell bunch of guys
except for their views
on African-Americans.
I think you're
overreacting.
Besides, aren't you
proud of how Farley
stood up for himself?
our father and I have
discussed the matter
and we feel it's in
everybody's best interests
if you quit
Did you ever think that
I might like to be
an active participant
in your little
tête-à-tête?
Sarcasm,
it's so teenager-ly.
Farley,
it's cheap.
Yeah.
Well,
so is talk.
¶
¶ Is it me or my
parents who is right? ¶
¶ One of us is clearly
not seeing the light. ¶
¶ I thought I had it all,
all figured out. ¶
¶ Now everything
seems so in doubt. ¶
¶
¶ Farley Gordon, ¶
¶ you should always
follow your heart. ¶
¶
¶ Yeah, I once
took that advice, ¶
¶ now everything's
falling apart. ¶
¶
Play that tape again.
I don't care if you're one
of the greatest players
to ever lace up
a pair of skates --
defend your honour.
Farley Gordon has come out
and said that he's a pacifist?
Ha!
I think that there's
another 'P' word
that is more appropriate.
We'll be back.
served with a
good helping of macho.
And ever since
your non-fight,
your testosterone-
to-estrogen ratio,
The offers are going
to start coming in
once you kick the
ass in masculine.
¶
¶
Oh!
¶
Maybe you should reconsider
your friendship.
Honestly,
they're just a little
misguided
about fighting.
I think eventually
they'll come around.
Eve, there's
something I've wanted
to talk to you
about for awhile now.
Of course,
Farley.
I don't know
where to start.
Please don't take this
the wrong way, okay?
Oh, God,
this is embarrassing
Being a Blade
has made me realize
just how isolated
I've been.
Like, maybe my parents
are just not as cool
as I once thought
Farley,
they were vegans,
environmentalists
and Yo-Yo Ma fans
before it
was fashionable.
And now you're
defending my parents?
Whose side are you on anyway?
They reject anything
that even has
a whiff of mainstream
before they
give it a chance.
I am sick of
being different.
Anyone can fit in.
Different, now that
takes imagination.
Does it?
Or is it a crutch?
Bless you.
Are you wearing
cologne?
Yeah.
And this stuff isn't
even on the market yet.
My agent wants to make sure
that if I do go Number One
there's a scent
that I can stand by.
Farley, I have a severe
fragrance allergy.
I thought you knew that.
Guess I forgot.
You know what
else you forgot?
My birthday.
It was yesterday.
Oh, Eve,
I'm--
Honestly,
I could care less.
Birthdays are
overrated anyway.
We move on.
Happy Birthday.
Marco."
¶
Ow!
Hey!
Leave me alone,
ass-face!
What are you going
to do about it, huh?
Come on.
Come on, kid.
What?
It's a quotation
from Ghandi.
You should look it up.
Damn it!
¶
¶ Farley,
we love you. ¶
¶ But this has gone on
way too long. ¶
¶ Stop being stubborn ¶
¶ and just admit
that you were wrong. ¶
¶ Joining the team
was a huge mistake. ¶
¶ Huge mistake. ¶
¶ It's made you miserable ¶
¶ Your inner joy,
inner joy. ¶
¶ an ordinary boy. ¶
¶ Ordinary boy. ¶
¶
¶ Yeah, just whose ideals
were they anyway? ¶
¶ What do you mean? ¶
¶ Is this a dream? ¶
¶ It's in your
best interests ¶
¶ to exercise our
parental rights. ¶
¶ And order you
to quit hockey ¶
¶ to restore... ¶
¶ your inner light. ¶
Stop!
Stop!
¶ about hockey being
boorish and absurd. ¶
¶ Ordinary boy. ¶
¶ when I grow up ¶
¶ Ordinary boy. ¶
¶ And now this conversation
is officially off-limits . ¶
¶ I've had enough of
this nonsense Damn it! ¶
¶
Let Marco be honest.
Your G-string playing --
Marco has written,
how you say,
a regalo?
Oh,
a gift to you
from the passion.
No...
the heart.
To you.
¶ piano ¶
¶ You ask me if I love you ¶
¶ I'd rather
hurt you honestly ¶
¶
You didn't write that.
Assurdo!
Of course Marco did.
No, you didn't.
It's a Dan Hill song.
My parents danced to
it at their wedding.
They're divorced.
No.
No, no, no,
it is not.
¶ And sometimes
when we touch ¶
¶ and hide. ¶
¶ I want to hold
you 'til I die. ¶
¶ 'Til we both break
¶ I want to hold you ¶
¶ 'Til fear in me subsides. ¶
¶
Marco!
Any reason you just
French-kissed me without
getting your passport
stamped first?
Oh,
Eve.
You think Marco does not
know what is going on?
you mentally
caress Marco.
¶
Marco,
the real estate
has already been sold.
Him?
The ragazzo?
He's more him than
you'll ever be.
¶
¶ What is happening to me? ¶
¶ Was it only weeks ago
that I was carefree? ¶
¶ Life was simple.
Life was easy. ¶
¶ Seeing Eve with Marco
made me queasy. ¶
¶
¶ That weren't all chaste. ¶
¶ That weren't exactly
all pure. ¶
¶
¶ Eve's my soul mate. ¶
¶ Isn't it ironic? ¶
¶ Eve's my soul mate. ¶
¶ I wish that it
wasn't platonic. ¶
¶
¶ You were always the
boy in the bubble. ¶
¶ Reality gave,
gave you trouble. ¶
¶ Let her know,
the world won't end. ¶
¶ Please, Eve's like
a sister to me. ¶
¶ These feelings
are creeping, ¶
¶ creeping into
impropriety. ¶
¶ Last time I checked,
you're not related. ¶
¶ Don't deny it.
Don't debate it. ¶
¶ Maybe the girl wants
to get freaky with you. ¶
¶ Who knows? She wants
to squeeze your bones. ¶
¶ She wants to
rub your nose. ¶
¶ Boys, thanks for the
female insights, ¶
¶ but,
trust me, ¶
¶ Eve doesn't want to
turn out the lights. ¶
¶ You've got to man up
with your woman ¶
¶ and hockey fights. ¶
¶ I swear that you'll start
sleeping better at night. ¶
¶ Speaking of sleep, ¶
¶ I've got
to go to bed. ¶
¶
¶ Honestly,
Farley, ¶
¶ try and get your
ass out of your head. ¶
Are you coming to
my recital tomorrow?
I can't.
I've got stuff to do.
But you've never
missed one yet.
You're my
good luck charm.
Well,
I'm sure you'll be fine,
especially with Marco
there by your side.
What's that
supposed to mean?
Nothing.
Come on,
Farley.
I know you
better than that.
Honestly,
nothing.
You two make
a great couple.
¶ Sarcasm really doesn't
suit you that well. ¶
¶ Hey,
what the hell? ¶
¶ You say you don't
have any feelings ¶
¶ for that
Italian fellow. ¶
¶ So why did I catch you
playing tonsil hockey ¶
¶ Farley, you're making
an awful mistake ¶
¶ To him, I did not my
heart and saliva forsake. ¶
¶ Eve,
I was there. ¶
¶ I saw what I saw. ¶
¶ The passion was real. ¶
¶
¶ What does it
matter to you anyway? ¶
¶ What, oh what,
do you want me to say? ¶
¶ I won't defend myself
or my reputation. ¶
¶ If you're
calling me a liar ¶
¶ let's end
this conversation. ¶
¶ Fine, if that's
how it's going to be ¶
¶ Farley, I don't understand
who you've become. ¶
¶ The boy that I once knew ¶
¶ is dead and done. ¶
¶ The boy that I once knew ¶
¶
¶
¶ Back off, buddy!
Leave me alone! ¶
¶ What are you going
to do about it? ¶
¶ Write a poem? ¶
¶
¶ I hate this game.
I hate my life. ¶
¶
¶ If you won't fight,
get off this ice. ¶
Drop him!
Fight!
Come on!
Hey!
Hit him!
Fight him!
You ready?
¶ I'm jonesing to unleash
these fists of fury. ¶
¶ Rope-a-dope display
of fighting flurry! ¶
¶ Let's go! ¶
¶
Get him!
¶
¶ It's on, let's go.
We're going toe-to-toe. ¶
¶ It's on, let's go.
We're going toe-to-toe. ¶
¶ My goodness! ¶
¶ Why did I ever
doubt that boy? ¶
¶ of happiness and joy. ¶
¶ Think I swallowed
my bicuspid. ¶
¶ Everything's gone
seriously awry. ¶
¶ Oh oh Honey, ¶
¶ I'm so sad
I can't even cry. ¶
¶
¶ Who is this person, ¶
¶ this person
in such a rage? ¶
¶ I've become a stranger ¶
¶ to myself on this stage. ¶
¶ It's no excuse. ¶
¶ I know that for sure. ¶
¶ But being one of the boys ¶
¶ held a surprising allure. ¶
¶ It's clear that I have
lost myself in this game. ¶
¶
¶ This person before me
is Farley Gordon ¶
¶ only in name. ¶
¶
¶ These cheers are hollow. ¶
¶ They are in vain. ¶
¶ Forcing my resolve ¶
¶ never to
play hockey again. ¶
¶ Where are you going? ¶
¶ I want to hug
you with pride. ¶
¶ Back where I belong... ¶
¶ Outside. ¶
¶
I'd like to
sincerely apologize
to everybody
who supported me.
It's now official.
Farley Gordon,
Ugh!
¶
Marco.
My soul has
heavy weather.
Why?
What's wrong?
Please don't
talk about Eve.
No,
is sole Italiana.
But I saw
you two kissing.
At the
rehearsal space.
but she spit out
my advance like
wine from the box.
Really?
it seems so...
so incredible.
¶
¶ You ask me
if I love you. ¶
¶ And I choke
on my reply. ¶
¶
¶
¶ What has happened? ¶
¶ Why can't I concentrate? ¶
¶ Aristotle is Aris-Notle. ¶
¶ Socrates is not
worth the debate. ¶
¶ philosophy used to be ¶
¶ jet fuel for my brain ¶
¶ Now reading a page ¶
¶ is positively Herculean. ¶
¶
¶ Since I quit, ¶
¶ the game obviously
holds no allure. ¶
¶
¶ But for my blues,
¶ even art doesn't
offer a cure. ¶
¶
¶
¶ How I miss her so. ¶
¶ But I can't find a way
past our current embargo. ¶
¶
¶ I try to
remain positive, ¶
¶ But I lose hope
she'll be gone forever. ¶
¶ I wish she'd
give me a call ¶
¶ or send me a letter. ¶
¶
¶ My world which
once seemed so full ¶
¶ of music and light ¶
¶ has been reduced
to a monochrome ¶
¶ black and white. ¶
¶
¶ He's no longer engaged. ¶
¶ Adolescent malaise. ¶
¶ Is there a cure? ¶
¶ Anything we can do? ¶
¶ Well, hopefully,
he'll grow out of it ¶
¶ in a year or two. ¶
¶
Oh,
son.
Farley, we've made a
huge parenting mistake.
And if hockey
was that utopia then
we should have
opened the gates.
And,
instead,
we threw away the
keys to the kingdom.
Well, you saw what
happened on the ice.
What I did,
what I became.
but where we failed
was in helping you
to navigate the nasty,
to sidestep the savagery,
and trounce the--
No,
no, no.
Yeah.
What we're trying to say,
Farley, is we're...
we're so sorry.
¶
¶ I barely remember ¶
¶ those weeks that went by. ¶
¶ Except for the
constant, irresistible cry ¶
¶ of the ice urging
me to come skate. ¶
¶ But I made my decision ¶
¶ I sealed my hockey fate. ¶
¶ started to waiver ¶
¶ as my exile dragged on. ¶
¶ I'm the addict
tempted by vice. ¶
¶ Too weak to resist
the lure of the ice. ¶
¶
¶ Has hockey corrupted
my very soul? ¶
¶ It was always a game ¶
¶ and never a life goal. ¶
¶
¶ Am I dreaming?
I must be asleep. ¶
¶ Why is Walter Gretzky
on this rink? ¶
¶
¶ The power of hockey ¶
¶ works in mysterious ways. ¶
¶
We're here
to see you past
this miserable phase.
¶
¶ We all know hockey's the
best sport on the planet. ¶
¶ Play your own game.
To thine own self be true. ¶
¶ Don't let a couple
of punches... ¶
¶ defeat you. ¶
¶ 'Cause hockey's
the greatest ¶
¶ game in the land. ¶
¶ You've got the goods
to be your own man. ¶
¶ 'Cause hockey's
the greatest ¶
¶ game in the land. ¶
¶ Time to change the plan. ¶
¶
¶ Could they be
onto something? ¶
¶ Could they be right? ¶
¶ I'm starting to see
this whole world ¶
¶ in a different light. ¶
¶ Maybe just maybe, ¶
¶ it's more heroic to play ¶
¶ To search my soul,
to find a new way. ¶
¶
I should have
guessed it was you.
Hey,
Eve.
I didn't realize that
the window was open.
You know, it's not
great for the environment
to waste all
that heat, right?
I can't shut my radiator
off, David Suzuki.
What do you want?
¶
¶ Eve ¶
¶ for being insensitive. ¶
¶
¶
¶ There's... ¶
¶ There's one thing
that I need to confess. ¶
¶
¶
¶ You're a goddess. ¶
¶
¶ well, you've
always seemed like ¶
¶ a sister to me. ¶
¶ All those feelings I tried ¶
¶ so valiantly to fight ¶
¶
¶ That you'd think my
love was, well, rude. ¶
¶
¶ Oh no, ¶
¶ maybe she's a prude. ¶
¶ Farley! ¶
¶
¶ How did I
miss that feeling? ¶
¶ It's so obviously
contagious. ¶
¶
¶ Now I understand
just how Marco ¶
¶ fits into the mix. ¶
¶
¶ Let's make
one thing clear ¶
¶ I only like men who
skate with sticks. ¶
¶
¶ You're the most
beautiful girl ¶
¶ I've ever seen ¶
¶ You're everything
I've wanted ¶
¶ You're this girl's dream ¶
¶ There's just
one more thing ¶
¶ to add to this refrain ¶
¶ I've decided to
play hockey again. ¶
¶
¶ You,¶
¶ It's always been you ¶
¶ It's always been you ¶
¶ It's always
been you ¶
¶ It's always
been you ¶
¶ It's always
been you ¶
¶
¶ You're not upset
With my choice? ¶
¶ Of course not.
Hockey's your muse. ¶
¶ Hockey's your voice. ¶
¶ Please just promise ¶
¶ that to your own self
¶
¶ Funny,
that's what someone else ¶
¶ said I should do. ¶
¶
Oh.                       Death?
Where's the dog?
Who?
Listen...
Respect, courage, heart!
So I don't care
how tired you are,
we play two-way
hockey tonight!
What the hell
are you doing here?
Coach, I'm here to
rejoin the team.
Last time I checked,
you quit because
the rough stuff offended
your sensibilities.
So I hate to break it
to you there buttercup,
but we still don't do
delicate in this league.
I think you're oversimplifying
the argument considerably.
¶
Can I say something?
¶
Really?
Right now?
¶
¶ After you quit, ¶
¶ we had a team meeting. ¶
¶ Behind closed doors, ¶
¶ in spite of my pleading ¶
¶ When you left the ice ¶
¶ on the brink of tears ¶
¶ It broke
something in us ¶
¶ that had been
building for years. ¶
¶ We took an objective
look at our behaviour. ¶
¶ Asked some more questions
as to who's not in favour. ¶
¶ As the way of the fist as
a game's divine right ¶
¶ And proving
your manhood with
¶ how well you could fight. ¶
¶ I swear we channeled
the spirit ¶
¶ of Oprah in that room. ¶
¶ The catharsis was awesome. ¶
¶
¶ But, Farley, our conclusion
never changed the fact ¶
¶ That if you can't dance,
we can't watch your back. ¶
¶ Though we all agreed
pacifism has a place ¶
¶ Just not in hockey ¶
¶ 'cause we'll
all be disgraced. ¶
¶ Actually, I might have
another way we can embrace.
¶
¶ My name is Farley Gordon
And I don't like to fight ¶
¶ My name is Farley Gordon ¶
¶ Let's have a
clean game tonight ¶
¶ His name is
Farley Gordon ¶
¶ He's showing
us a new light ¶
¶ Though we might not
all agree that ¶
¶ his philosophy
is actually right. ¶
¶
¶ Get off this ice unless you
want to feel my wrath ¶
¶ It's okay I can handle this
misplaced aggression ¶
¶ Let's have an on-ice
therapy session ¶
¶
¶ Don't think I won't
rip off your head ¶
¶ I'd rather hug
it out instead ¶
¶
Aw!
¶ This is stripping
all my bravado ¶
¶
¶ Let's end
this dispute ¶
¶ and I'll gladly
let you go ¶
¶ Argh...! ¶
¶ Okay,
truce. ¶
¶ I won't make you
drop the gloves. ¶
¶ I sincerely appreciate
your outpouring of love. ¶
¶
¶ Anyone else going care
to take a run at me? ¶
¶
¶
¶
¶ One, two, three, four! ¶
¶ Pugilist or pacifist
We can all be fans. ¶
¶ It's hockey!
It's hockey! ¶
¶ The greatest
game in the land. ¶
¶ Moose Jaw to Newfoundland ¶
¶ This we understand ¶
¶ Because hockey,
hockey's ¶
¶ the greatest
game in the land. ¶
¶ Wickenheiser,
Cassie Campbell, ¶
¶ you can be a woman. ¶
¶ It's hockey,
hockey ¶
¶ The greatest
game in the land ¶
Woo!
Yeah!
Yes!                    Yeah!
¶
¶ I swear this kid is going
down in history. ¶
¶ What do I know?
No one ever listens to me. ¶
¶ At least he's going to make
us a boatload of money ¶
¶ Hockey,
hockey ¶
¶ The greatest
game in the land. ¶
¶ Look at him skate
He satisfies all my rages. ¶
¶ His name is Farley Gordon ¶
¶ And his girlfriend
is hot-rageous ¶
¶ Hockey,
hockey ¶
¶ The greatest
game in the land. ¶
¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hockey, hockey ¶

Hockey, hockey ¶
¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hockey, hockey ¶
¶ The greatest
game in the land. ¶
¶ His name is Farley Gordon ¶
¶ And he's showing
us a new light. ¶
¶ He's making me look
like a sieve tonight ¶
¶ His name is Farley Gordon ¶
¶ And his skills
are out of sight ¶

hockey ¶
¶ The greatest
game in the land. ¶
¶ Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hockey, hockey ¶

¶
Was your son
a late bloomer or...?
Are you from Mars?
Oh,
no.
Do you have any advice
for a new hockey dad?
Give your son or
daughter
every opportunity
to play the game
and enjoy the
game and get better
at it all the time.
I suppose.
Boy, you see how much the
sticks cost now, though?
I just saw
one for $200.
My first stick was
one from the bush.
I cut a
tree branch down
and carved a hockey
stick out of it.
That was
my first stick.
Oh my gawd.
I lived on a farm.
Isn't that something?
That's amazing.
Come on,
we'll watch the game.
