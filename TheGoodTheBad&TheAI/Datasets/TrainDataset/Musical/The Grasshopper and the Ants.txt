Come here, son.
Listen, the good book says,
the Lord provides.
There's food on every tree.
I see no reason to worry and work.
No, sir, not me.
J' You shouldn't soil your Sunday pants
like those other foolish ants
J' Come on, let's play
and sing and dance J'
Hey!
Hi, Queenie.
You'll change that tune
when winter comes
and the ground is covered with snow.
Oh, wintertime's a long way off.
You dance? Let's go.
J' You shouldn't soil your Sunday pants
like those other foolish ants
J' Come on, let's play
and sing and dance J'
Food, food.
Oh, Madam Queen,
wisest of ants,
don't throw me out.
Please give me a chance.
With ants,
just those who work may stay.
So, take your fiddle
and DlaY-
J' I've been a fool whole yearlong
and now I'm singing a different song
J' You were right
I was wrong J'
