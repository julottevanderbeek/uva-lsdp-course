Dolly:
Mrs. Dolly Levi...
Dolly: Social introductions
arranged...
Woman: ...In an atmosphere
of elegance and refinement.
Woman:
''Object--matrimony.''
Business trip or
pleasure trip, Mrs. Levi?
Mr.Jones, with me,
business is always a pleasure.
You've got more businesses
than a dog has fleas.
As my late husband
Ephraim used to say,
if you have to live
from hand to mouth,
you'd better be
ambidextrous.
Ha ha ha!
Where to, Dolly?
Yonkers, to handle
a highly personal matter
for Mr. Horace
Vandergelder,
the well-known,
unmarried
half-a-millionaire.
Gonna marry him
yourself, Dolly?
Whatever put such
a preposterous idea
into my head--
Your head. Oh!
Don't be ashamed, girls.
Life is full of secrets,
and I keep 'em!
I've told you
a thousand times
that I will
marry her!
Not without my permission
you won't!
This is
a free country!
She's consented and
I'm going to marry her!
I'm telling you
that you will not!
And I'm telling you
I will!
Never!
Tomorrow! Today!
Ermengarde's not for you
nor anybody else...
who can't support her.
You are an artist!
I make a very good
living!
A living's made
by selling
something everybody
needs at least once a year,
and a million is made
by producing something
everybody needs
every single day.
You artists,
you painters,
produce nothing
that nobody needs never!
You might as well know,
any way we find to get married
is right and fair,
and we'll do it!
You are an impractical,
That's an insult!
All facts about you
are insults!
Thank you for the honor
of your visit!
Ermengarde's of age.
There's no law--
Law?! Let me
tell you something.
The law's there
to prevent crime.
We men of sense are there
to prevent foolishness.
I, not the law,
will prevent you
from marrying
my niece!
I've already taken
the necessary steps.
Mrs. Dolly Levi's
on her way here now.
Dolly Levi--
your marriage broker?
She's going to
take Ermengarde
to New York--
New York?
Yes! And keep her there
until this foolishness
is out of her head
and yours.
We'll see
about that!
Thank you again for the honor
of your visit and good morning!
You'll have to sit still,
Mr. Vandergelder.
If I cut your throat,
it'll be practically unintentional.
Ah, 90% of people
are fools,
and the rest of us
are in great danger
of contamination.
Enough! I'm a busy man
with things to do.
A scraped chin
is the least of them!
I did the best I could,
Mr. Vandergelder.
Joe?
Yes?
I've got special reasons
for looking my best today.
Is there something
extra you can do--
Something
a little special?
What?
Those things you do
to the young fellows.
Smarten me up
a little bit.
You know, face massage,
little perfume water.
All I know is,
like usual.
That includes
everything
that's decent
to do to a man.
I don't want you blabbing
this at the barber shop,
but I need something
extra today
because I'm going
to New York
to call on a refined lady--
name of Miss Irene Molloy.
Your calling on ladies
is none of my business.
Hold your horses,Joe!
Uncle Horace!
Uncle Horace!
What, Ermengarde?
What have you done
to Ambrose?
I had a quiet
little talk with him.
You did?
Yes. I explained to him
that he's a fool.
Oh, Uncle!
Weeping, weeping--
a waste of water.
I've done you a good turn.
'ou'll come thank me when you're 5
But, Uncle, I love him.
Save your tears
for New York
where they won't
be noticed.
But I love him!
I tell you that you don't!
Leave those things
to me.
If I don't
marry Ambrose,
I'll die
of a broken heart!
Never heard of it.
Are you ready
for Mrs. Levi?
Yes.
Well, stay in your room
until she arrives.
Cornelius!
Barnaby!
Barnaby!
Cornelius!
Barnaby!
You stamped,
Mr. Vandergelder?
Yes, I stamped.
Are my niece's bags
at the railroad station?
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.
And you, did you label
them properly?
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.
Good. Look, I'm going
to New York today.
I'll be marching
in the 1 4th Street parade.
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.
I'm staying overnight
at the Central Hotel.
We've never
been here alone.
In honor
of the occasion,
I'm going to promote
you both.
Cornelius,
how old are you?
Mr. Vandergelder.
Is that all?
That's a foolish
age to be at.
I thought
you were 40.
No. I'm 28 3/ 4.
Man's not worth a cent
until he's 40.
We pay him until then
to make mistakes.
Anyway, you're promoted
to chief clerk.
Chief clerk?
What am I now?
You're
an impertinent fool!
If you behave yourself,
I'll promote you
from impertinent fool
to chief clerk
with a raise
in your wages.
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Vandergelder.
You, Barnaby,
I'm promoting you
from idiot apprentice
to incompetent clerk.
Thank you,
Mr. Vandergelder.
Mr. Vandergelder?
Mr. Vandergelder?
What is it?
Does a chief clerk get
one evening off a week?
So that's the way
you thank me, eh?
No, sir! You'll attend
to the store as usual!
An evening free.
Keep asking
for evenings free,
and you'll find yourself
with your days free.
Remember that.
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder.
Listen I want you to run
the place perfectly
in my absence.
If I hear of foolishness,
I'll discharge you both.
You might as well know now,
when I return from New York,
there'll be some changes
around here.
Changes?
Yes, you're going
to have a mistress.
I'm too young,
Mr. Vandergelder.
Not yours, idiot. Mine.
I mean I'm planning
to get married.
Married?
Any objections?
No, but--
Many congratulations,
Mr. Vandergelder,
and to the lady, too.
That's none
of your business!
Any further questions?
No, but--
But why what?
Speak up! What?
Why?
Why what, damn it?!
Why are you
getting married?
Let me tell you
something, son.
I've worked hard,
and I've become rich...
and friendless and mean.
In America, that's about
as far as you can go.
It's time to be doing something
a little bit foolish.
Besides, I need
a steady housekeeper.
Besides, I need
a steady housekeeper.
Well, well,
well, well, well.
Good morning,
Mr. Vandergelder,
Mr. Hackl,
Mr. Tucker.
Gentlemen.
Good morning Mrs. Levi.
Uh, good morning,
Mrs. Levi.
How handsome
you look today.
Ooh. You absolutely
take my breath away.
Ermengarde's upstairs
crying her eyes out.
You can take her now,
but blow her nose first.
If only Irene Molloy
could see you now.
Uh, find someplace else
to loaf!.
And you two get back
to the store!
Don't forget to put the lid
on the sheep dip!
I don't know what's
come over you lately,
but you seem to grow
younger every day.
If a man eats careful,
there's no reason
why he should look old.
You never said
a truer word.
Even if I never see
at a glance
you'll be stamping
about at 1 00,
eating 5 meals a day
just like my uncle,
may he rest in peace.
Let me see your hand,
Mr. Vandergelder.
Oh, show me your hand.
Why?
I'm a judge of hands.
I read hands.
I use them
to get things done.
Lord in heaven!
Goodness gracious!
I just can't believe it!
Such a long life line,
from here to here.
It runs right off
your hand.
They'll have to hit you
with a mallet.
They'll have to stifle
you with a sofa pillow.
You will bury us all.
I will?
Say...
Yes?
You're all spiffed up
today, aren't you?
Yes.
And not for the benefit
of this smelly horse.
Well, if I had a guess,
I'd say you was goin'
somewhere.
Remarkable, Mrs. Levi.
How do you do it?
Mr. Vandergelder.
With a head like yours,
you'll be rich someday.
That's exactly
what I had in mind.
Then I suggest
you pick up Ermengarde,
for which I'm paying you
good money.
Speaking of business,
Mr. Vandergelder,
I suppose
you've given up
all idea
of getting married.
Is that
what you suppose?
Then suppose you listen
to this, Mrs. Levi.
I've decided--
I've practically decided
to ask Irene Molloy
to be my wife.
You have?
Yeah, I have.
I'm going to New York
and discuss it with her.
This very afternoon.
Well, that is just
about the best news
I have ever heard,
Mr. Vandergelder.
Oh, yes, indeed,
marvelous news.
Isn't it wonderful,
though?
I'm wracking
my brain here.
I'm trying to think
of something I've heard
that has made me
happier,
but I just can't
come up with a thing.
It's just so wonderful.
It really is.
It's all your fault,
you know.
You put me into this
marrying frame of mind
with your introductions
and scheming.
A poor widow must earn
a living.
One morning I wake up
and suddenly the house
seems like an empty shell...
and pretty messy, too.
A man needs someone
to take out the garbage.
And Irene Molloy's
the one to do it.
Darling girl.
I think it's
perfectly wonderful
what's gonna happen
in your household,
Mr. Vandergelder.
I never did like
the idea of all that--
All that money of yours
lying in great piles
in the bank,
so useless
and motionless.
As my late husband
Ephraim used to say,
''Money should circulate
like rainwater.
''It should be flowing
down among the people
''through dressmakers,
cabmen, and restaurants.
''Setting up
a business here,
furnishing a good time
over there.''
Oh, you and the future
Mrs. Vandergelder
will see that all
your hard-earned wealth
flows in and around
many peoples' lives--
Just flowing,
pouring out.
All right.
Stop saying that!
I wish you happiness
under the sun,
and good-bye,
Mr. Vandergelder.
Yes, well,
good-bye.
And when I get back
to New York,
I'll tell the heiress
not to wait.
What did you say?
Oh, nothing, nothing.
A word--
Well,just a minute.
That's kind of unusual,
isn't it, Mrs. Levi?
I haven't been
hunting usual girls
to interest you,
Mr. Vandergelder,
but now all that
is too late.
You're engaged
to Irene Molloy.
I'm not engaged.
I can't keep disturbing
these fine women
unless
you mean business.
Who said
I don't mean business?
You're playing
a dangerous game.
Dangerous?
Of course
it's dangerous.
It's tampering with
a woman's affections,
and the only way
to save yourself
from that charge,
Mr. Vandergelder,
is to get married
to someone soon--
Very soon.
Don't worry.
I won't.
I'll meet you in front
of Molloy's hat shop
at 2:30 as usual.
Never mind. No need to.
You've done your work.
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.
I'll be there to ensure
that nothing goes wrong.
Just tend
to Ermengarde
or return the fee
I gave you.
Speaking of money,
I almost forgot--
How much?
I left all my money
in my other handbag
which burned in a fire
at cleaners--50?
Plenty.
Oh, bless you.
And don't worry
your handsome head
about a thing.
Just keep
all your thoughts
on that lovely
Irene Molloy.
If he had any taste
at all,
he'd have the shutters
done over in green.
Mmm...
forest green shutters.
What are
you doing?
Get away!
My uncle!
He's not here.
Now, quick.
We're running away.
Hurry, before
the train gets here.
Train?
New York. To be married.
We're going to elope.
Elope? How can you
use that awful word?
Oh, Ermengarde.
My, what a romantic scene.
I want to marry Ambrose
but not elope!
This doesn't concern
Mrs. Levi.
Everything concerns
Dolly Levi.
Don't listen.
I know why
you're here.
To help you,
and love needs
all the help it can get.
Listen, both of you.
There's no time.
I'm feeling an updraft
in my underpants.
This is no way
to elope.
If you follow
my suggestions,
Horace Vandergelder will
not only give permission
but he'll dance
at your wedding,
and not alone either.
Mr. Kemper,
can you dance?
Dance?
Yes, dance.
I'm an artist.
I paint.
No problem.
''Painters taught
how to dance.''
I'll take you
to New York.
See? I told you!
You will stay
close by.
You'll take her
to dinner
at the Harmonia
Gardens restaurant.
You'll enter
the polka contest.
Polka contest?
The prize
is a gold cup
and money.
The cups we won,
my husband and I.
Now wait a minute.
I'm surprised you have
acquaintances like that.
Not acquaintances,
Ermengarde, friends--
Dear friends
from days gone by.
My late husband Ephraim
believed in life--
anyplace
you could find it--
wherever
there were people,
all kinds of people.
And every Friday night,
even when times
were bad--
Every Friday night,
like clockwork,
down those stairs
of the Harmonia Gardens
we came,
Ephraim and I.
Not acquaintances,
Ermengarde--friends.
It's all very well
for you, Mrs. Levi,
but you're suggesting--
Do you want
to show Horace
that you
mean business?
- Yes!
- Yes!
Well, you must go
to the Harmonia
Gardens restaurant.
Say that Mrs. Levi
sent you...
and, yes, well...
tell Rudolph that
Dolly's coming back.
Dolly's coming back.
Yes. I want a table
for two
and stuffed chicken
for 8:00.
Mr. Vandergelder
will learn
of your triumph.
Everything will work
out beautifully.
But how, Mrs. Levi?
How? Ha ha ha!
Ha--Ohh.
and I still don't
get an evening free!
When am I gonna
begin to live?
Barnaby, how much
money have you got?
Huh?
That you can get
your hands on?
About $3.00. Why?
Barnaby,
you and I
are going
to New York!
We can't close
the store!
We'll have to,
'cause some rotten cans
of chicken mash
are going to explode.
Holy cabooses!
How do you know?
'Cause I'm gonna
light candles under them.
They'll make
such a stink
customers won't come in
for 2 4 hours!
We're going to New York,
and we're gonna live!
We'll have a good meal,
we're gonna be in danger,
get almost arrested,
and spend all our money!
Holy cabooses!
And we are not coming
back to Yonkers
until we've each
kissed a girl.
Cornelius,
you can't do that.
You don't know
any girls.
I'm 28 3/ 4.
I've got to begin
sometime.
I'm only 1 9 1 /2.
With me,
it's not so urgent.
May I make
a suggestion?
Mrs. Levi!
I just couldn't
help hearing.
We'll be fired.
We were only talking!
Mr. Hackl, Mr. Tucker,
there's nothing
that makes me happier
than the thought
of 2 fine young men
such as yourselves
enjoying the company
of 2 lovely ladies.
What ladies? Where?
In New York,
to which,
unless my ears
play tricks,
you are bound.
Now, there's
this millinery shop
run by
a charming woman.
''Irene Molloy.''
And her assistant,
Miss Minnie Fay.
Holy cabooses!
And now that you've
noted the address,
I have only this
to say--
in the afternoon
is the ideal time
for conversation--
definitely
no later than 2:30.
If you ever say this
was my suggestion,
well, I shall
denounce you both
for the terrible
liars you are.
Ohhh!
A millinery shop.
Women who work.
Adventure, Barnaby!
I'm scared.
Living, Barnaby!
I'm scared.
Will you come,
Barnaby?
Yes, Cornelius! Yes!
The lights of Broadway,
elevated trains,
the stuffed whale
at Barnum's Museum!
Stuffed whale. Wow!
Women who work!
Wow!
All clear up here,
Cornelius!
You gonna light 'em all?
Hey, Cornelius, look out!
That bottom row's swelled up
like they're ready to bust!
Holy cabooses!
What a smell!
Get dressed, Barnaby!
We're going to New York!
Ermengarde, keep smiling.
No man wants
a little ninny.
Ambrose, do a turn,
let me see.
Mr. Hackl, Mr. Tucker,
don't forget Irene and Minnie,
just forget you ever
heard a word from me.
Do get done
with that, Minnie.
Do get done
with that, Minnie.
The men are eyeing us
for the wrong reason.
A banana a day keeps
the doctor away.
You mean an apple a day.
Who ever heard of a doctor
slipping on apple peel?
How are you,
Miss Molloy?
If I felt any better,
I'd be positively indecent.
Oh, you  in
a mood today.
Oh, I certainly am.
Not that it's any
of my business,
but is it because--
Minnie,
I don't mind
that you never
finish your lunch,
but do mind that you never
finish your sentences.
Are you really
going to--I mean--
Silly girl, say it.
Am I marrying
Horace Vandergelder?
Yes, I'm considering it
if he asks me.
Oh, I'd rather die
on the rack
than ask such
a personal question,
but as long as
we're on the subject,
why would you? I mean--
Because he's rich.
He can rescue me
from the millinery.
I hate hats.
Hate hats?
Good afternoon to you,
Officer Gogarty.
And the rest
of the day to you,
Miss Molloy.
Ah, Minnie, why is it
all the attractive men
in New York are married?
Blarney, Miss Molloy!
Blarney!
Come on, get going!
All of you!
Oh, the way
you talk!
It's natural
to talk about men.
I mean, what you said
about hating hats.
Not just hats.
Particularly the women
who buy them.
You don't mean that,
Irene Molloy.
Yes, I do, Minnie.
All lady milliners
are suspected
of being wicked women.
Wicked women?
Those dowagers
come in the shop
merely to stare
at me.
Ooh. How dare they?
If they were certain
I was a wicked woman,
they wouldn't set foot
in the shop.
Good riddance.
Who needs them?
do,
unfortunately.
So do I go out
to restaurants?
No. It would be bad
for business.
Do I go to balls
or theaters
or operas?
No. It would be
bad for business.
The only men
I ever get to meet
are the merchants who come
to sell me things.
I'm sick and tired of being
suspected of being wicked
with nothing
to show for it.
Oh-ho! Miss Molloy!
Why does everybody
have adventures but me?
Adventures?
I have no spirit,
that's why.
No gumption.
Either I marry
Horace Vandergelder,
or I'm gonna burn
this shop down
and break out
like a fire engine
and find myself
some excitement.
The things you're
saying today!
I think they're
just awful.
Oh, aren't they, though?
And I'm enjoying
every word of it.
What's this?
Another return
from Miss Mortimer.
She wants cherries
and feathers--
To catch a beau,
I suppose.
If you asked me,
she'd do better
with a heavy veil.
Well, I told her ribbons
down the back
is the thing to catch
a gentleman's eye.
But she'd have
none of it.
Minnie, make another hat
for Miss Mortimer.
I'm wearing
this one myself.
Oh, but you can't.
Why not?
Because it's--
it's provocative,
that's why not.
Well, who knows
that provocative
isn't just what
I want to be today?
Miss Molloy,
you don't love
Horace Vandergelder.
Of course
I don't love him.
Then how can you--
I mean--
Look. There are 2 men
staring at the shop.
Minnie: Men?
Uh-huh.
Aren't they delicious?
Minnie:
You don't think--
Yes, I do believe
they mean to come in here.
Men in the shop!
What will we do?
Do? Why flirt with them,
of course.
I'll give you
the short one.
Ooh, Miss Molloy,
you're terrible!
We'll heat them up,
then drop them cold.
It'll be good practice
for married life.
You say vamp,
I'll scream.
Vamp.
Aaah!
I must say I like
the tall one.
Adventure, Barnaby.
We can still
catch the train
back to Yonkers.
Oh, I feel dizzy.
Or go see
the stuffed whale
at the museum.
Women, Barnaby.
Stuffed...
women.
There's no one here.
We can leave.
I'd never forgive
myself.
Hah!
Are you sure
this is an adventure?
You don't have
to ask, Barnaby.
When you're in one,
you'll know it.
How much money
have we got left?
Enough for the train,
dinner, and the whale.
When they come out,
we'll pretend
we're rich.
We won't have to
spend anything.
Why don't we say
Mrs. Levi sent us?
No! We're not supposed
to ever say that!
Shh!
We're 2 men-about-town
looking for hats for ladies.
What ladies?
Good afternoon,
ma'am.
Wonderful weather
we're having.
How d'you do,
ma'am?
And how
are your hats?
Charmed to make
your acquaintance.
Lovely place
you have here.
Good afternoon,
gentlemen.
Cornelius Hackl
here.
Barnaby Tucker here.
Irene Molloy here.
I'm very happy
to meet you.
Is there anything
I can do for you?
Ooh!
Well, you see,
we're 2
ladies-about-town
lookin' for hats
to Molloy--
We're hats,
and we wondered
if we could buy a lady
or 2 to Molloy with--
We want a hat.
Well, for a lady,
of course.
Everyone said to go
to Miss Molloy's
'cause she's
so pretty--
I mean, her hats
are so pretty.
And what sort of hat
would Mrs. Hackl
be liking?
Oh, no,
Miss Molloy,
there is
no Mrs. Hackl.
Yes, there is.
Your mother.
She didn't mean that,
did you, Miss Molloy?
Now, this lady friend
of yours,
couldn't she come in
with you some day
and choose the hat
herself?
Impossible.
There is no
lady friend.
I thought you said
you were here
to choose--
I mean
she's Barnaby's.
Huh? What?
Yes, but she lives
in Yonkers.
She said to pick out
something
under a dollar.
Don't be silly,
Barnaby.
Money's no object with us.
None at all.
Oh, my assistant--
Miss Minnie Fay.
Mr. Hackl,
Mr. Tucker.
Good afternoon, ma'am.
Afternoon, ma'am.
Excuse me, Mr. Tucker,
did you say Yonkers?
Yes, ma'am.
We're from Yonkers.
Well,  you?
Yes.
And forgive me
for saying this,
but you should see
Yonkers, Miss Molloy.
I mean, perhaps you and
your gentleman friend
here in New York
might like to see it.
It's the most beautiful
town in the world--
That's what they say.
So I've heard,
but I'm afraid I don't have
a gentleman friend here.
You don't?
Barnaby, she doesn't
have a gentleman friend.
Ha ha ha!
Hey, that's too bad.
If you should happen
to have a Sunday free--
You're Catholic,
aren't you?
Don't worry.
I'm willing to change.
If you're free
in the near future,
I'd, well...we'd...
like to show you Yonkers
from top to bottom.
It's very historic.
As a matter of fact,
I might be there
sooner than you think.
This Sunday?
You see, I have a friend
who lives in Yonkers.
Perhaps you know him.
I do?
Oh, it's always so foolish
to ask in cases like that,
isn't it?
Why should you know him?
It's a Mr. Vandergelder?
Mr. Vandergelder, oh!
Horace Vandergelder?
Of Vandergelder's
Hay and Feed?
Yes, do you know him?
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!
- No!
- No!
- No, no!
- No, no!
Mr. Vandergelder's
coming to see me
this afternoon.
Coming here?
This afternoon?
Cornelius!
Cornelius, look!
It's wolf-trap!
Look out!
Beggin' your pardon,
Miss Molloy.
Gentlemen,
what are you doing?
We'll explain later.
Just help us!
Come out of there
this minute!
We're innocent as can be,
Miss Molloy.
I insist that
you both come out,
or I'll be forced--
Mr. Vandergelder,
how nice to see you.
And Dolly Levi.
What a surprise.
Irene, my darling,
how well you look.
You must be in love.
Afternoon,
Miss Molloy.
What a pleasure to have you
in New York.
Yes. Yonkers lies up there
decimated today.
We thought we'd pay you
a visit, Irene,
unless it's inconvenient.
Inconvenient?
Whatever gave you
that idea?
Mr. Vandergelder thought
he saw 2 customers
in the shop--
Men!
Oh ho ho.
In a ladies'
hat shop?
Ha ha ha!
Come on, let's go
into my workroom.
I'm so eager for you
to see it.
I've already
seen it twice.
But I need
your advice.
Advice
from Mr. Vandergelder.
The whole city should
hear this and grow rich.
Advice is cheap,
Miss Molloy.
It's the things that come
gift-wrapped that count.
I have never heard it
put more beautifully.
Thank you,
Mr. Vandergelder.
Chocolate-covered
peanuts, unshelled.
They're
the expensive kind.
Why don't we open them
in the workroom?
Miss Molloy,
I have important business
to discuss with you
as soon as Mrs. Levi
says good-bye.
Pay no attention to me.
I'm just browsing.
Business,
Mr. Vandergelder?
Hay and feed?
Well, not exactly.
A new hat shop
in Yonkers?
I hear it's a very
beautiful city,
and quite historic
according--
Yes, go on.
Who's been telling you
about Yonkers, may I ask?
Oh, nobody.
A friend.
What friend?
Well, you see,
he--
He?
Yes, uh...he--
His name,
Miss Molloy.
What?
His name.
Oh, I believe it was--
is Mr. Cornelius Hackl
of Yonkers.
Cornelius Hackl?
Yes.
Do you know him?
He's my head clerk.
He is?
He's been in my store
for 1 0 years.
Where would
you have known him?
Just one of those
chance meetings,
I suppose.
Yes, one of those
chance meetings.
Chance meetings?
Cornelius has no right
to chance meetings!
Where was it?
Really!
It's unlike you
to question me
in such a way.
The truth
might as well
come out now.
Your head clerk
is better known
than you think.
Nonsense.
He's in New York
all the time.
Everybody knows
Cornelius Hackl.
He never comes
to New York.
He works all day
in my store.
So you think,
but it's not true.
Dolly Levi,
you are mistaken!
Horace Vandergelder,
you keep your nose so deep
in account books,
you don't even
know what goes on.
By day, he's your faithful,
trusted clerk.
But by night, oh, by night,
he leads a double life.
Why he's, why he's here--
Umm...at the opera,
at the great restaurants,
the fashionable homes.
He's even at the Harmonia
Gardens restaurant
The fact is,
he is the wittiest,
gayest, naughtiest,
most delightful man
in New York City.
He's just --
famous Cornelius Hackl!
It ain't
the same man.
If I thought Cornelius
came to New York,
I'd discharge him!
Who took the horses off
ofJenny Lind's carriage
and pulled them
through the streets?
- Who?
- Cornelius Hackl!
Who dressed up as a waiter
at the Fifth Avenue Hotel
and took an oyster
and dropped it right down--
No, it's too wicked.
I can't say it.
Say it!
No, but it was
Cornelius Hackl.
It ain't the same man!
Where'd he get the money?
Oh, he's very rich.
Rich?! I keep his money
in my own safe.
He has $1 45.36!
Oh, Mr. Vandergelder,
you are killing me.
He's one
of  Hackls.
They built
the Raritan Canal.
Then why would he work
in my store?
I don't wanna hear it.
I'm going home.
I have a headache.
It ain't the same man.
You can't escape facts.
I just made him
chief clerk!
If you had any sense,
you'd make him a partner.
Irene, I can see
you're as taken with him
as everybody else is.
But I only met him
once.
Now, don't be thinking
of marrying him.
Dolly, what are
you saying?
Careful. He breaks hearts
like hickory nuts.
Horace: Who?
Cornelius Hackl.
Miss Molloy,
how long has he been
calling on you?
Mr. Vandergelder,
suppose I told you
he has not been
calling on me?
Excuse me.
Not now, Minnie!
Aaah!
Stop singing,
Minnie!
There's a man
in there!
That's not amusing,
Minnie.
But there's a man!
We don't wish
to be interrupted.
Go back immediately.
The poor dear is tired
from overwork.
If there's a man in there,
we'll get him out!
Whoever you are,
come on out!
Do you realize
what you're saying?
I certainly do!
Before you move
or say another word
that you might
regret, allow me.
Dolly!
Stand back.
There. You see?
So much
for this nonsense
about that
darling girl
hiding a man
in the closet.
We'll forget
you ever said it.
It's forgotten.
Ah-choo!
Because there's
nobody in there.
Ah-choo!
God bless you.
Miss Molloy?
Yes, Mr. Vandergelder,
there is a man in there.
I see.
There also happens
to be an explanation,
but for the present
I should just say
good afternoon.
Ah-choo!
Ah-choo!
Another?
Another.
Good Lord,
the whole room
is crawling with men.
Irene, darling,
congratulations.
Miss Molloy,
I shan't trouble you again.
And I hope, vice versa.
Horace, where
are you going?
To march in
the 1 4th Street parade
with the kind of people
I can trust--
Ah, ah, ah, ah!
Now.
I demand
an explanation!
Have you met
Minnie Fay?
Leave, or I'll call
for Officer Gogarty!
There's no fun
in a jailhouse.
Jail?!
Jail!
Everybody,
don't talk at once!
Just because you're
rich and famous...
Rich and famous?
Don't deny it.
Doesn't mean
you won't make up
for this trouble.
We'll do anything.
Irene,
Cornelius Hackl.
We've already met.
Jail is
absolutely out.
Cornelius,
explain to her.
I'm Cornelius Hackl.
Minnie Fay.
The only way
to make up for it--
Yes, of course--
You can have them
both put away for years
on this charge.
Help, police, help.
Only have dinner
with them first
to show that you tried
to settle amicably.
Dinner first, life
imprisonment later.
It's a lovely day.
It's gonna be
a lovelier evening.
Something could happen
before you send them
to jail.
Oh, by all means.
It's what Barnaby
and I had in mind.
Minnie, we've been
respectable for years.
Now we're in disgrace.
We might as well
make the most of it.
We'd be delighted
to accept.
It's the only sensible
thing to do.
Cornelius!
Now, I know
a doughnut shop--
Doughnut shop!
Certainly not!
We want a fine dinner
in the fashionable world.
And I know
just the place--
The Harmonia Gardens
on 1 4th Street.
Harmonia Gardens!
But wait a minute.
The finest food
that money can buy,
and a lovely orchestra.
A polka contest tonight.
Dancing!
Just ask
for Rudolph.
Oh, we could never
go there.
It sounds marvelous!
Come, Minnie.
We'll close the shop,
and take the whole
afternoon off.
Oh, I mean,
we could never.
Don't misunderstand.
It isn't money,
or anything.
It's the...the...
What, Mr. Hackl?
It's the dancing.
You see, I don't know how,
and they have contests
and things like that
at Harmonia
Whatever-it-is.
You said so
yourself.
It would take me
weeks, months,
years to learn.
''Mrs. Dolly Levi.
''28 3/ 4 year-old
chief clerks
taught how to--''
Now, you just put
one arm here
and one arm there.
It's no use.
I have absolutely
no sense of rhythm.
Absolutely no sense
of rhythm
is one of the primary
requirements
for learning
by the Levi method.
Just give me 5 minutes
of your time, Mr. Hackl.
I'll have you dancing
in the streets.
I think we'll start
with lesson 7.
Right foot, touch,
left foot, touch,
under, back around,
touch.
Back through around,
out, over, release,
unfurl, oh, oh.
That's wonderful,
Mr. Hackl.
When I think
of the lucky women
who'll find heaven
in your arms--
I think we'll go
back to lesson one,
shall we?
Put your hand
on her waist
and stand...
with her right
in your left...
hand.
And...
That's right.
And 1 , 2,
Ah.
this one.
And 1 ...
Look!
I'm dancing!
Aah...
I was.
Of course you were,
Mr. Hackl.
Look! I'm dancing!
Ah! Uh, come here.
The word I think I'd use
is athletic.
Good.
That's wonderful.
Look, everybody!
I, Cornelius Hackl,
sport,
I'm dancing!
You're next,
Mr. Tucker.
Ah!
And everyone,
stand aside!
Uh, not yet,
Mr. Tucker.
He's dancing!
I think he's holdin'
out on us.
Whatever you do, Mr. Tucker,
keep breathing.
Ha ha ha!
Oh!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha!
Come on.
Dolly!
Cornelius is taking us
to see the parade.
Everyone
will be marching.
Cornelius:
Come on, Mrs. Levi!
Oh, Dolly, the world is full
of such wonderful things.
Hurry, before
the parade passes by!
Yes, I will.
I will.
Before the parade
passes by.
Ephraim, let me go.
It's been long enough,
Ephraim.
Every night,
just like you'd want me to,
I've put out the cat,
made myself
a rum toddy,
and before I went to bed,
said a little prayer
thanking God
that I was independent,
that no one else's life
was mixed up with mine.
But lately, Ephraim...
I've begun
to realize that...
for a long time...
I have not shed one tear.
Nor have I been for one...
moment...
outrageously happy.
Now, Horace Vandergelder,
he's always saying,
''The world
is full of fools,''
and in a way,
he's right, isn't he?
I mean, himself, Cornelius,
Irene, myself.
But there comes a time
when you have got
to decide
whether you want to be
a fool among fools...
or a fool alone.
Well, I have made
that decision, Ephraim,
but I would feel
so much better about it if--
If you could just
give me a sign--
any kind of a sign
that you approve.
I'm going back, Ephraim.
I've decided to join
the human race again.
And, Ephraim...
I want you to give me away.
Waah! Waah!
Ha ha ha ha!
Present arms!
Quarter...arms!
Present...arms!
Forward march!
Dolly Levi!
Hi!
Gussie Granger?
What in the world
are you doing here?
Earning
an honest dollar,
which is more
than I've made
on the legitimate stage
in 2 years.
I don't have pity
on you,
but the meatpacker's
float?
Ha! Listen, if there
was more money in it,
I'd play
one of the pigs!
I came here
for some privacy.
I owe you an apology.
I didn't want to let it
go another minute.
You owe me
more than that.
What about the fee
I gave you
for getting me
tangled up
with that collector
of men's hats?
Irene Molloy--She was
a disappointment.
The confectioner
gave me back every cent
for those
chocolate-covered peanuts.
Sorry. I never give
cash refunds.
However, being
an honest woman,
I've arranged to
make it up to you.
Dolly Levi, let me make
one thing clear.
You have been discharged
as my marriage broker.
I have no further use
for one.
From now on,
you're just a woman
like anyone else.
I am?
And I'm just a man
like anyone else.
And just like
anyone else,
I'll do everything I can
to avoid introductions
such as you
specialize in.
I understand your feelings,
Mr. Vandergelder.
And I'm here marching
beside you
to assure you
there will be no need
for my services
after your dinner
engagement tonight.
Dinner engagement?
Gardens restaurant.
Private room.
Table for 2.
She'll be waiting.
Who? Who-Who'll
be waiting?
Who-who'll
be waiting?
The very rich,
beautiful lady
I referred to
in Yonkers
this morning.
The heiress
to a fortune,
remember?
I'm not interested.
What's her name?
Uh...Ernestina.
I'm not interested.
What's her last name?
Simple, uh...
Simple.
Ernestina Simple.
Can she cook?
Ha ha. Can she cook?
Frankly, I could
never understand
why a girl like that,
who could afford every
servant in New York
makes
all her own meals...
on a solid gold stove.
Sounds like a fool.
And I'm not interested
in fools.
Neither am I.
Good day, Mr. Vandergelder.
Don't forget--
Rent some evening clothes.
She's fussy.
Dolly Levi,
you are a damned
exasperating woman!
Why, Horace Vandergelder,
that is the nicest thing
you have ever said to me.
Cornelius, are you sure
all they're doing
is changing
their clothes?
Don't worry.
They'll be here.
I get dressed
every morning
in less
than 3 minutes.
Women wear more.
They do?
Underneath.
Maybe we'd better leave
while there's still time.
Never.
We've seen everything.
The parade,
the Statue of Liberty,
the stuffed whale
at Barnum's Museum.
I could die
a happy man right now.
It'll be worth it
no matter what.
The worst
anybody can do
is put us in jail,
but as long
as we live,
we'll never forget
the night
we took Irene Molloy
and Minnie Fay
to dinner at
Harmonia Gardens...
on less
than a dollar.
Cornelius,
wake up!
And there's
another reason
we can't go back
to Yonkers--
One more thing
we promised to do
before we go back
and turn into
a couple Vandergelders.
Cornelius!
You're not thinking
of kissing Miss Molloy?
Maybe. Ha ha ha!
She'll scream.
Barnaby, you don't know
anything about women.
Only that we
can't afford them.
You might
as well know
everybody except us
goes through life
kissing
right and left
all the time.
They do?
Yes.
I often wondered
about that.
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Oh!
Smile, Barnaby.
I'm smiling.
Look rich and gay
and charming.
I'm looking gay
and charming.
Hello.
Here we are.
Minnie: Hello.
Cornelius...
Ah...I'm pleased
to meet you,
Miss Molloy.
No last names.
After all we've
been through together
this afternoon,
it's Irene
and Minnie.
Irene.
Oh.
Oh...
Does that count,
Cornelius?
I don't think so.
Count?
We were counting
here
while we were
waiting.
I hear all rich people
do nothing
but count their money.
I'm so hungry.
Why don't we go in
and have some
hors d'oeuvres first?
No, no, no!
It's very fashionable.
It would spoil
our appetites.
Or we could have
an aperitif.
It's out
of the question.
Barnaby and I
don't agree
with that sort
of thing.
But all those people do.
Well, they simply
don't know that, um...
aperitif is no longer
considered elegant.
Oh, it isn't?
Hasn't been
for years.
In that case, it's on
to Harmonia Gardens.
Call a hack,
Cornelius.
Hack?
I've always wanted
to ride in a hack.
There's one.
Yoo-hoo!
No, no! We can't do that!
I mean, it isn't the money
or anything.
It's just that...
nowadays,
really elegant people
never take hacks.
Hacks
is out.
They all go
by streetcar.
Then by all means,
we go by streetcar.
Imagine. I've been
elegant all my life
and never knew it.
Of course.
If you really want
to be really elegant...
Oh, we do.
We do.
You walk.
You walk.
If you please.
Hmmph!
Good evening.
Good evening.
Straighten up!
Walk erect!
Pleasure. Good evening.
How nice to see you.
Psst! No expression.
Let the food smile.
And how are you
this evening?
Charming, charming.
You! You there!
Come up here
at once.
Yes, you.
How dare you keep me
standing here this long?
As soon as
Mr. Vandergelder arrives,
you will be seated,
Miss Simple.
Look here, garcon--
My name is Rudolph.
Rudolph Reisenweber.
Why, may I ask,
can I not wait
at the table?
Please, please.
Harmonia Gardens does not
consider it proper--
A lady alone.
Perhaps
if you'll let me
take your wrap--
Oh! Don't touch me.
Where?
If you will
excuse me.
Certainly not.
Yes, what can
I do for you?
How are you,
Adolph?
How's
my old friend?
I am Rudolph.
Oh, of course.
Ha ha. Rudolph.
We'd like a little
something to eat.
You know?
In what name
is the reservation,
please?
Reservation?
I'm afraid there
is nothing available.
Come on!
Let's go!
This is
Cornelius Hackl,
Cornelius
Hackl.
Tell him about
the Rockefellers.
The Rockefellers? I see.
I know a little place
up the block.
I think
I have something.
Yes, I have something.
Follow me, if you will.
Dining room
number 2.
It's the last one.
Very private.
It is?
Very exclusive.
Very fashionable.
Don't say
another word.
And very
expensive.
That was the word.
How beautiful!
How elegant!
How much?
I thought you said
everyone here knew you.
Oh, don't worry.
They will after tonight.
She is?
I don't believe it!
And the chicken.
Mrs. Dolly Levi
coming here
after such
a long absence.
It's too happy
to be true.
That's the message
he told me to you.
Who? Who are
these people?
Rudolph: They look truthful.
If you're gonna spend
the whole evening
acting like
a scared rabbit,
maybe I better order
some lettuce.
How can you be
so brave?
It's not fair.
Just try to remember
Mrs. Levi's advice.
I only wanted
to marry you,
not perform in public.
There's nobody here
who knows us.
Oh, Ambrose,
are you sure?
Sweetheart, have
I ever been wrong?
Rudolph: Sir?
Vandergelder's the name.
Yes,
Mr. Vandergelder.
Uh, there's a Miss
Ernestina Simple
supposed to be waiting.
Right there,
Mr. Vandergelder.
No, I'm afraid you didn't
understand what I said--
But perfectly.
Mr. Vandergelder is here,
Miss Simple.
Yes, so I see.
Oh, good evening,
Miss Simple.
I hope so,
Mr. Vandergelder.
All right, my good man.
Fritz, private dining room
number one!
Follow me, if you will.
You may take my arm.
And unless you're suffering
from a head cold,
kindly remove your hat.
I have an important
announcement to make.
After an absence
of several years,
there will return
to the Harmonia Gardens
restaurant tonight
the lady who always
had the happiest smile,
the warmest heart,
and the largest appetite
in the city of New York!
- Dolly!
- Dolly!
- It's Dolly!
- It's Dolly!
- Dolly!
- Dolly!
Dolly!
Ah! Ah! Ah!
It is therefore my order
as headwaiter
of the Harmonia Gardens
and your
supreme commander,
that tonight of all nights,
our usual lightning service
will be twice
as lightning as ever!
Or else!
Waiter,
write this down.
Mock turtle soup,
roast pheasant
under glass--
Pheasant?
I'll have the same,
and champagne.
Champagne?
What would you like?
for good behavior?
What do you mean,
''Oysters
aren't in season''?
Anybody can have
oysters in season.
I want them
out of season.
They don't have any,
Miss Simple.
Then tell them to go out
and dig for some.
Oh!
-
-
Oh.
Hello, again.
Here we are.
We thought
something happened.
Don't worry,
it will.
Barnaby...
Irene, Minnie...
I feel so good
about everything,
so good about
this whole day,
that I am now going
to become an honest man
and tell the truth.
Cornelius?
I'd forgotten what
strange things
happen to men
when they drink.
If I tell you
the truth,
will you let me put my arm
around your waist?
Good heavens,
you can do that even
if you lie to me.
Ahhhh!
I've never touched
a woman before.
You still haven't.
That's my corset.
You're a wonderful
person, Irene.
Thank you,
Cornelius.
And that's why
I have to tell
you the truth.
If it'll make you
feel better.
It's all those
fancy things
that Mrs. Levi
said about me--
Oh, yes.
Well...
they're just not so.
Indeed?
Irene, I'm not rich.
Not rich?
I'm none of the things
Mrs. Levi said I was.
And neither is Barnaby.
We're not sports.
We don't know anybody.
We never come to New York.
We never do anything
except work all day
and clean the store at night.
And we wanted so much
to have one day
of adventure,
that we ran away
from Yonkers
and told a lot of lies.
Well, look at us,
a pair of penniless
pretenders.
But, Cornelius,
I've known that
all along.
You have?
Why else would you two
have hidden?
And made us walk
all over New York?
You're the nicest ladies
a man ever went to jail for.
Jail?
We don't have money
for this dinner!
Of course you don't.
Minnie,
show these 2 sports
what I've got in my purse.
What a pleasure to know
that selling
all those silly hats
can pay for an evening
as delightful as this one.
Oh, I can't help myself!.
Wow!
Oh! I--hah!
No, no, Minnie,
my white handbag,
not that one.
My white handbag.
When we changed
for the evening.
Oh!
Minnie!
Only my mad money--
A nickel
for the horse car.
Would you like
your check now, sir?
Take this away,
my good man.
Bring us another bottle
of champagne.
What's this?
What are you doing?
It's 8:00,
Mr. Vandergelder.
I really
must be going.
Going?
You haven't finished
your dinner yet.
That's
expensive food.
If I ordered
that every night,
I'd be
out of business!
I suggest you have
the waiter put it in a bag
and take it home to Yonkers
to your horses and pigs.
I don't have pigs,
Miss Simple,
I have chickens.
I didn't get them
by being wasteful!
I see no point in this
trivial discussion,
nor in my remaining
here any longer,
in as much as it is
quite clear that you are--
If you forgive
the expression--
Entirely unsuitable.
Unsuitable?
I assure you, I'll never
say a word to Mrs. Levi
about this
unfortunate evening.
I suggest you do likewise
when she arrives here.
Wait a minute!
Did you say
''Arrives here''?
Yes, she planned
to join us at 8:00.
You may tell her I left
because I felt sick
to my stomach.
It's quite true,
you know.
Good night.
Any man who goes
to a big city
deserves
what happens to him.
He's all yours, honey.
Good. Mr. Cassidy?
Yes, Mrs. Levi?
It's all right now.
You can let me out.
Whoa!
Mr. Reisenweber,
come here. Hurry!
Shh.
How many times
have I told you
not to shout?
It's her.
She's outside!
What's going on?
Are you sure?
I know that voice.
I heard her.
In a beautiful carriage
with two horses.
That's her.
She's come!
Who? Who's come?
You wouldn't know her.
Mrs. Levi.
Is it true?
Yes. It's Dolly!
Tell the band
to get ready.
You saw her?
Yes. She was in
a white carriage
pulled
by four horses!
It's like
old times!
Mr. Reisenweber!
Rudolph!
Rudy!
She is here.
Tell it to me sweet!
I think you did,
Stanley.
Look who's here.
Hello, Louis.
I am so glad
to be back.
Thank you,
Louis.
Does it show?
- Wow!
- Wow!
One more time!
Horace Vandergelder.
Do we know
each other?
Much too well.
Oh, it's you,
Mrs. Levi.
Yes.
Well, do you, um...
do you think
you have the figure
for that
sort of get-up?
That's for others to say.
I borrowed it
from a friend,
not being one
of those rich ladies
who have nothing better
to do with their time
than dilly-dally
with seamstresses.
Which reminds me,
where is Miss Simple?
Miss Simple?
Yes.
Well, she had to, uh...
She got called away
by a sick friend.
Oh, well,
that's Ernestina--
Always thinking
of other people.
We'll just have to
make do without her
for the time being.
Rudolph.
My dear Mrs. Levi!
I've saved the best
table for you.
How I've missed you,
Rudolph!
This way, please.
Come along,
Mr. Vandergelder.
Don't stand here.
You'll get run over
by a waiter.
Oh, hello!
How are you?
Hi! Nice to see you!
You know
too many people.
Total strangers.
Then why
do you greet them?
It feels good to have
so many friends.
Say hello
for me, too.
I already did.
Lovely, Rudolph.
What are we doing
down here?
There's someone in
the dance competition
I especially
want you to see.
Rudolph, this is
Mr. Vandergelder,
Yonkers' most
influential citizen.
We've already met.
He insists on
buying the finest.
I never said
any such thing.
Unfortunately,
I'm watching
my waistline.
Can't eat a thing.
What's ready
immediately?
You ordered chicken--
I couldn't
face a chicken.
Not after what
I've been through.
Cancel the chicken.
And bring a turkey!
With everything
on the side!
Now, tell me about
you and Ernestina.
It was short,
but was it sweet?
I mean,
did it go well?
You have a habit of asking
highly personal questions.
If you're thinking
of getting married,
you must learn to
let women be women.
Did you like her?
Did she like you?
Always putting your nose
into other people's affairs!
Anybody who lived with you
would get as nervous as a cat!
What?
Anybody who lived
with you--
Get that idea
out of your head
this minute!
Why, the idea
of you
even mentioning
such a thing!
I have no intention
of marrying you!
I didn't mean that!
You've been hinting
for some time now,
so put those ideas
out of your head!
That's not what
I meant at all!
I should hope not!
You go your way
and I'll go mine.
You can't
turn my head
with chocolate
covered peanuts--
Unshelled!
The idea
of you even
suggesting
such a thing!
You misunderstood me!
I certainly hope so.
Let's not discuss it.
Here's our food.
I don't feel well.
Here is a lovely,
lovely wing for you,
and some dumplings,
lighter than air.
That's what I need--
some air.
And some giblets.
Very tender and
very good for you.
You go your way,
I'll go mine.
Have some wine.
You'll feel better.
Since you brought
this matter up,
I have one more
thing to say.
I didn't bring
the matter up!
True, I like to
manage things,
but nothing
as disorderly
as your household,
as out of control,
as untidy--
Do that
for yourself.
It's not
out of control!
Let's not say
another word about it.
Have some beets.
I don't like beets!
A complaining,
friendless soul like you
is no sort of
companion for me.
Stop saying that.
I'm finished.
I'm not those things
you said I am!
Maybe, but you are
the only person
in the world
that knows it.
No, Horace,
I have decided
to enjoy life.
You can find
some housekeeper
who'll prepare
three meals
for a dollar a day.
It can be done
if you like
cold beans--
I can see you now
spending your last days
listening
at keyholes,
for fear somebody's
cheating you.
Have
some more beets.
I hate beets!
That's the difference
between us.
I've been nagging you
all day long
to get some spirit
into you.
You could be
a perfectly charming,
witty, amiable man
if you wanted to.
I don't want
to be charming!
But you are!
Look at you!
You can't
help yourself.
''Listening
at keyholes.''
You have no right
to say such things to me.
At your age, you ought
to enjoy the truth.
My age. You're always
talking about my age!
I don't even know
what your age is,
but with bad food
and bad temper,
you'll double it
in six months.
Now sit down,
Horace!
However, there's
one more thing--
I don't want to hear it!
You're wasting your time.
I have no intention
of asking you to marry me!
Oh, so you want me
to ask you?
Sorry.
I'm turning you down.
How can you?
I haven't asked!
It's no use arguing.
Let me cut your wings.
I don't want
my wings cut!
No man does.
I've got a headache.
I'm leaving.
You can't.
The dance competition's
about to begin.
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I may have
your attention please!
It is my pleasure to announce
on behalf of the management
of the Harmonia Gardens
restaurant
that our dance contest
is about to commence!
The judges for
tonight's competition are--
Mr. Herman Fleishacker!
Mr. Llewelyn Codd!
And our special
guest-of-honor judge,
Mrs. Dolly Levi!
Sit down!
If you wish to participate
in this evening's contest,
come to the dance floor.
Remember, to the lucky
winning couple
goes the grand prize
of 50 silver dollars
or an engagement at
the Harmonia Gardens!
Everybody dance!
Your check, sir.
Another bottle
of champagne.
Look at that man,
Horace!
What grace,
what talent,
what a magnificent
living
he could earn
with his feet!
Horace, look.
- Where?
- There.
Wait a minute.
Oh, isn't he wonderful!
That's Ambrose Kemper,
the so-called artist.
Why, so it is.
No wonder his pictures
are so awful.
He must paint
with his feet.
He's sure to win
first prize.
Ermengarde
should see him now,
dancing with
another girl.
And so pretty, too.
Shameful!
That's what it is!
Shameful!
Look! There's
that Molloy woman
dancing with a man!
I think it's a man.
Only a few hours ago
she was waiting
for me to propose.
Shocking!
No faithfulness
left in this world!
Oh, I agree.
People like us
should marry someone
just to set the world
a good example.
My hat!
I'm trying to find--
Oh.
Excuse me.
Ermengarde!
Uncle.
My niece!
Aah!
You are a disgrace
to Yonkers!
Stop that!
Grrr!
Don't you dare--
Come here, you!
Mr. Vandergelder,
the contest!
I'll show you a contest!
Call the police!
Call the police!
Uncle Horace,
we can explain!
Expl--I'll give you...
Cornelius Hackl!
What are you doing here?
I'm just delivering
some oats.
Oats? With my
former intended?
You're discharged!
You can't fire me!
I quit!
So do I!
Barnaby Tucker,
you're discharged!
You can't fire me!
I quit!
I'm sorry.
Grrr!
Oh!
Horace Vandergelder,
flat on your back,
you are still charming.
Cornelius.
Barnaby.
Perhaps there's a way
I can get Mr. Vandergelder
to give you back
your jobs.
What? How?
I could become his wife.
No, that's impossible.
It is?
Yes.
But why,
Cornelius?
Because...
That's why.
Give me a reason.
Never mind the reason!
Shhh!
And don't tell me
to shush.
What's going on?
- Cornelius!
- Irene!
Hey, you, what's
all this noise?
What's happening here?
Now you stay out
of this, Officer!
Are you all right, miss?
I'll let you know
in a little while.
I'm only trying to tell
this lady something.
It's too late,
and you're too loud,
you're disturbing
the peace!
No, it's not too late!
That's why I'm shouting!
I never did anything!
I just worked,
took orders,
never went anywhere.
Stayed in Yonkers!
Yonkers?
And today,
the most important thing
that can happen to a man
happened to me
because I left Yonkers
and came to New York
and met this lady
this afternoon.
Mister--Just what
are you talkin' about?
Officer,
I'm talking about
none other than love.
Love?
Love?
Are you telling me that
after 28 years in Yonkers
you've fallen in love
with this lady in one day?
No, I didn't
fall in love
in just a day.
It was much quicker
than that.
An hour--No, even
that's too long!
What's less
than a minute?
A second?
Less than that.
A moment.
That's it!
That is it!
Now all of you,
listen to me...
please.
Isn't the world
full of wonderful things?
I have lost
so many things.
My job, my future--
Everything that people
think is important,
but I don't care!
Even if I have
to dig ditches
for the rest of my life,
I'll be a ditch digger
who once had a wonderful day!
Mister, do you mind?
I came in late.
Right after...
Tell Rudolph
not to worry
about the damage.
Send the bill
to Vandergelder's
Hay and Feed Store,
Yonkers, New York.
There's your life
for you, Horace.
I don't want
to hear about it!
Without niece,
bride, clerks.
I'm tired.
I've got a backache.
That's about
all you do have.
I hope you're
satisfied.
Never mind.
I guess there's only
one thing more
for me to say.
If it's to ask me
to marry you,
never,
not in a million years!
It wasn't that
at all, Horace.
All I wanted
to say was...
What?
What are you
talking about?
Nonsense!
Don't try to stop me!
And on those cold
winter nights, Horace...
you can snuggle up
to your cash register.
It's a little lumpy,
but it rings.
Quiet!
Quiet down there,
you little monsters.
Cornelius! Barnaby!
Do you hear me down there?
Ermengarde!
What the devil is this?
What's this chicken mash
doing all over?
Cornelius! Barnaby!
Get up here this minute
and clean up this mess!
Well, good riddance.
I didn't need you before,
and I don't need you now!
Ermengarde!
I'm ready for
my breakfast!
I want three eggs
with crisp bacon,
hot porridge with cream,
and grits!
It's not fair.
It's worse than that.
It's lonely.
Not in a million years,
Dolly Levi.
You go your way,
and I'll go mine.
Good morning,
Uncle Horace.
Good morning,
Mr. Vandergelder.
Come crawling back,
have you?
I've a good mind
not to take you,
but being as how
I'm so soft-hearted,
start cleaning up
this mess!
We're not coming back
to work for you,
Mr. Vandergelder.
Barnaby and I
are stopping by
for our money.
We decided to
go into business.
Business!
And since we only
know hay and feed,
we're opening
our own store.
Mrs. Levi's found
the perfect location.
Across the street
from you.
She wouldn't dare!
Hackl and Tucker,
Incorporated.
Ha! You'll last a week.
What about my breakfast?
Uncle Horace...
I think you'd better
start learning
how to make it yourself.
All right,
all right.
My conscience
is clear.
A man can only do so
much to keep fools
from their own
natural folly.
Why, Horace Vandergelder,
as I live and breathe.
How well you look today.
I came by
to return your cane.
Don't let me interrupt.
What were you doing?
Getting Cornelius
and Barnaby's money.
$1 46.3 5.
Plus $6.1 2 of mine.
And the money
my mama left me.
That's right.
$52.48.
I'm positive--
I know, I know.
If all you can
think about is money,
the safe is upstairs!
Ooh!
And I have
the combination!
You stay here.
If you insist,
Horace.
Ephraim Levi,
I'm gonna get married again.
I'm gonna marry
Horace Vandergelder.
And I'm asking
your permission.
It won't be a marriage
in the sense that we had one,
but I shall certainly
make him happy.
You can be sure of that.
I am going to marry
Horace Vandergelder
and send his money
out into the world
doing all the things
you taught me.
As you always said, Ephraim,
money--
pardon the expression--
is like manure.
It's not worth a thing
unless it's spread around,
encouraging
young things to grow.
Anyhow,
that's the opinion of
the future
Mrs. Horace Vandergelder.
And, Ephraim...
I'm still waiting
for that sign...
that you approve.
Mr. Vandergelder--
Outside, front and back.
Bossy, scheming,
meddling, irritating,
inquisitive,
exasperating.
Horace.
I know you're no
longer interested,
but I have found you
the ideal wife.
Dolly Levi, I don't want you
to find me any ideal wives!
If I want an ideal wife,
I'll find one of my own,
and I have found her,
and it's you, damn it!
I've been a fool and
probably always will be,
but, Dolly,
forgive me and...
marry me.
No, Horace, I...
I don't dare.
What do you mean?
You know
as well as I do
that you're
the first citizen
of Yonkers.
Your wife would have
to be a somebody.
You are. You are
a wonderful woman!
Do you really think
I have it in me
to forego fancy clothes
and expensive jewels,
and instead be
a benefactress
to half the town?
In other words,
to be a credit to you?
Dolly, everybody knows
that you could do
anything you wanted to do.
By the way,
here's the money
I borrowed
from you yesterday.
Keep it.
Oh, Horace.
I never thought
I'd ever hear you
say anything like that.
It's bad business
letting Cornelius
open up a store
across the street.
It was your idea.
Make him your partner.
And Barnaby can have
Cornelius' old job.
We'll all dance at
Ermengarde's wedding.
You've gone too far!
I'll dance at no wedding!
Besides, I can't dance!
It'll take years
to learn.
All right, I'll dance.
Excuse me,
Mr. Vandergelder.
I said outside!
What is going on
around here?
I'm having the shutters
done over in forest green.
Forest green shutters?
The old paint's
still good,
but that fella's
just set up a business
and needs
a good start.
Dolly, I've always felt
that money--
Pardon the expression--
is like manure.
It's not worth a thing
unless its
spread around,
encouraging
young things to grow.
Thank you, Ephraim.
Wonderful woman!
