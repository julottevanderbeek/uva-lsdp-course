Narrator: YOU KNOW,
MEMORIES HAVE A WAY
OF BEING GOOD AND BAD.
AND THAT OLD MUSIC BOX
REMINDED GRANDPA

ON THE OTHER HAND,
IT BROUGHT UP THE NIGHT
THAT BILLY LOST HIS VOICE.

YOU GAVE HIM A COW
FOR CHRISTMAS?!
NOPE.
IT WAS SANTA CLAUS.
YOU'RE TEACHING THE BOY
TO BELIEVE IN THAT FANTASY?
THERE AIN'T NOTHIN' WRONG
WITH A LITTLE BELIEVIN'
AFTER WHAT
HE'S BEEN THROUGH.
EXACTLY.
THIS DREADFUL FARM
IS A CONSTANT REMINDER
OF THAT HORRIBLE FIRE.
THIS FARM JUST ISN'T SAFE,
LET ALONE FOR A BOY
WHO CAN'T TALK.
Grandpa Charlie:
OH, AGNES.
Narrator:
BILLY FOLLOWED ANNABELLE
RIGHT INTO THE BARN
WITHOUT EVEN THINKING
ABOUT IT.
Narrator: BUT WHEN HE SAW
WHERE HE WAS,
HE WAS SCARED TO DEATH.
WOOF! WOOF! WOOF!
OOF!
AH...
AH...
AH...
AH-CHOO!
BLESS YOU!
BLESS YOU!
OH. ALL I SAID
WAS, "BLESS YOU."
AWOO! THE CAT'S
OUT OF THE BAG.
OH, MAN,
THE CALF BLEW IT!
OH, BOY. SANTA'S
GONNA BE MAD!
THAT'S BAD.
THAT'S REALLY BAD.
THAT'S BAD.
THAT'S REALLY BAD.
WHERE'S WILLIAM?
HE'S IN THAT HIDEOUS
BARN, ISN'T HE?
ISN'T HE?!
SHH! SHH! SHH!
NOW--NOW THEY'RE COMIN'.
NOW, JUST--JUST
GIVE 'EM THE USUAL.
BILLY...
YOU OK?
THIS IS NO WAY
TO RAISE A CHILD.
NOT IN FRONT
OF THE BOY, AGNES.
FINE.
LET'S GO INSIDE THEN,
BEFORE I TAKE ON
THE STENCH
OF THESE FILTHY ANIMALS.
OINK OINK OINK OINK.
NOPE. NOT ME.
PEE...YEW!
OH!
CACA!
HEE HEE HEE HEE!
Aunt Agnes:
DON'T JUST STAND THERE!
I'M--I'M COMIN', AGNES.

I'M GONNA TAKE CARE
OF THAT OLD BIDDY
ONCE AND FOR ALL.
OOH! HOW DISGUSTING!
I HEAR THAT.
OH, SANTA'S
GONNA BE MAD.
NOW--NOW--NOW, HOLD IT!
HOLD IT! HOLD IT DOWN
JUST A DOGGONE MINUTE NOW.
NOW, IT'S, UH, TRUE
THAT WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO
TALK IN FRONT OF HUMANS,
BUT I GUARANTEE
IT'LL BE OK
IF IT DOESN'T
GO ANY FURTHER.
NOW, BILLY'S NOT GOIN'
TO TELL ANYONE...
WELL,
AT LEAST
THAT'S MY OPINION.
YEAH. HE WON'T
SAY ANYTHING...
WILL YA, BILLY?
YOU WON'T, WILL YOU?
ANNABELLE, HONEY...
DEAR...YOU SEE,
BILLYCAN'TTALK.
BILLYCAN'TTALK.
I'LL COME
RIGHT TO THE POINT.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
WILLIAM'S WELFARE.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
WILLIAM'S WELFARE.
BILLY'S FARIN'
JUST FINE, AGNES.
WELL, EVER SINCE
MY DEAR BROTHER--
REST HIS SOUL--
AND THAT DAUGHTER
OF YOURS WERE...
LOST...
I'VE WORRIED MYSELF SICK
OVER LITTLE WILLIAM.
I'VE WORRIED MYSELF SICK
OVER LITTLE WILLIAM.
WHAT'S TO BECOME
OF THAT POOR,
PATHETIC LITTLE CHILD?
PATHETIC?
DIDN'T YOU SEE
HOW HAPPY HE WAS?
AND HE'S NOT AFRAID
OF THE BARN ANYMORE,
THANKS TO ANNABELLE.
OH.
OH, AND THAT BOVINE
WITH THAT BOW.
WHY...
THAT'S THE SILLIEST
THING I'VE EVER SEEN.
THE BOY DOESN'T
NEED A COW.
HE NEEDS A DOCTOR.
DOC TAYLOR SAYS THERE'S
NOTHIN' HE CAN DO.
DOC TAYLOR!
THAT BOY NEEDS
REAL DOCTORS,
NOT SOME
COUNTRY HICK
WHO TREATS PIGS
AS WELL AS PEOPLE.
AWOO!
OHH...OF COURSE...
MMM...
OF COURSE...
YOU AGREE THAT
I CAN GIVE HIM
THE BEST
THAT MONEY CAN BUY.
MMM.
MMM.
WHY NOW, AGNES?
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE,
AND YOU DIDN'T WANT HIM.
WELL...
I CHANGED MY MIND.
I'LL MAKE
THE PERFECT,
THEPERFECTMOTHER.
WILLIAM WILL BE
MUCH BETTER OFF
WITH ME...
IN THE CITY.
THE ANSWER IS NO.
NO.
N-O.
YOU'RE NOT
GETTIN' BILLY!
WE'LL SEE ABOUTTHAT.
YOU'VE NOT HEARD
THE LAST FROM ME.
I HAVE LAWYERS, YOU KNOW.
I DON'T WANNA HEAR FROM HER
THE FIRST TIME.
WOULDN'T HEAR
THE LAST FROM ME.
I NEVER LIKED HER
TO BEGIN WITH...
BUT THAT'S JUST MY OPINION.
DO YOU LIKE MY RIBBON?
SANTA GAVE IT TO ME.
SANTA'S GOT THESE COWS
WITH THOSE THINGS
ON THEIR HEADS.
I THINK
THAT HE CALLED THEM...
RRR-REINDEERS.
YOU KNOW, THEY CAN FLY?
I'M GONNA LEARN
TO FLY, TOO!
I'M GONNA ASK SANTA
NEXT TIME I SEE HIM.
I'M GONNA ASK SANTA
NEXT TIME I SEE HIM.
THAT'S GONNA BE MY WISH.
THAT'S GONNA BE MY WISH.
WHAT YOU DOIN',
BILLY?
WANT TO SEE WHAT I GOT
FOR CHRISTMAS?
WOW! WHERE'D YOU
GET THE CALF?
SHE'S SO CUTE!
OH, I GET IT.
YOU'RE PRETENDING
SHE'S A REINDEER, HUH?

UH, I MEAN SLEIGH.
WANT TO BE AN ELF,
BILLY?
WANT TO BE AN ELF,
BILLY?
I'VE DECIDED
I WANT TO BE THE ELF,
SO YOU HAVE TO BE

WOOF! WOOF!
SOMETIMES I'D SWEAR
SHE KNEW IT BEFORE HE DID.
SOMETIMES I'D SWEAR

Annabelle:
ARE WE IN TROUBLE?
SHH! NOW--NOW--NOW,
JUST DON'T LOOK BACK.
WONDER HOW THE OLD MAN
CAN AFFORD TO FEED
THE LITTLE HEIFER.
HMM...
MAYBE I SHOULD PAY
OLD MAN BAKER A VISIT...
AND COLLECT ON THE DAMAGES
HIS LITTLE HEIFER JUST DONE.
DID YOU HAVE FUN TODAY,
SWEETHEART?
OH, MAMA,
BILLY IS
MY BESTEST FRIEND.
MAMA...
HOW COME
BILLY CAN'T TALK?
WELL, HONEY...
Y-Y-YOU SEE,

OH.

DREAMS ARE SO IMPORTANT.
OH, SHE'LL GROW

I MEAN, I USED TO DREAM.
I USED TO DREAM
OF BEING FAMOUS.
YOU KNOW, LIKE, UH,

Narrator: GRANDPA WAS RIGHT,
OVER THAT YEAR,
ANNABELLE, BILLY, AND EMILY
COULDN'T BE PULLED APART.
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
HOW COME YOU ONLY
HANG OUT WITH GIRLS?
AND COWS?
HUH, BILLY?
HOW COME?
WHY DON'T YOU
LEAVE HIM ALONE!
WHY DON'T YOU LET BILLY
STICK UP FOR HIMSELF.
OH, I FORGOT.
HE CAN'T TALK.
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS
'CAUSE YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY FRIENDS.
STAY OUT
OF THIS, EMILY.
HA HA HA!
Both: HA HA HA!
Both: HA HA HA!
AAH!
AAH!
OOF!
OOH!
Narrator: TALKIN'
JUST WASN'T REQUIRED
FOR THE KIND OF FRIENDSHIP
THEY HAD.
FOR THE KIND OF FRIENDSHIP
THEY HAD.
PA, REMEMBER THAT COW
BILLY GOT FOR CHRISTMAS?
IT'S DANGEROUS, PA.
IT ATTACKED US
FOR NO REASON AT ALL.
YEAH.
WE WEREN'T DOIN' NOTHIN'.
WERE WE, BUCKY?
WE WERE JUST MINDIN'
OUR OWN BUSINESS.
RIGHT, BUCKY?
RIGHT, BUCKY?
YOU GONNA CALL
THE SHERIFF, PA?
HMM.
HMM.
MY BOYS DON'T LIE.
GUS, THEIR STORY'S NOT
EXACTLY HOW IT HAPPENED.
THE BUS DRIVER WITNESSED
THE WHOLE INCIDENT.
BOYS, GET IN YOUR ROOM
RIGHT NOW.
I'LL DEAL WITH YOU LATER.
B-B-BUT, PA!
DON'T YOU SASS ME.
DON'T YOU SASS ME.
WHAT'S GOTTEN
INTO YOU, GUS?
YOU'VE BECOME
A MISERABLE OLD SCROOGE,
AND IT SHOWS IN THE WAY
YOU'RE BRINGIN' UP
THOSE TWO BOYS.
DID YOU EVER WONDER WHERE
CHARLIE GOT THE MONEY
TO PAY FOR ANNABELLE?
WELL, I'LL TELL YA.
THAT MUSIC BOX
HIS DAUGHTER LOVED SO MUCH,
SOLD IT TO
AN ANTIQUE DEALER IN TOWN.
SAD.
LOTS OF MEMORIES
WERE IN THAT BOX.
IT'S STILL THERE, GUS.
AND YOU,
OF ALL PEOPLE,
SHOULD KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO LOSE A LOVED ONE.
SHOULD KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO LOSE A LOVED ONE.
THIS HAD BETTER BE
GOOD NEWS.
I BELIEVE I'VE
DISCOVERED OUR LOOPHOLE.
WONDERFUL!
YOU FINALLY EARNED
YOUR BIG BUCKS.
THE KID'S ALL YOURS.
YOU'LL HAVE HIM
BY CHRISTMAS.
YOU'LL HAVE HIM
BY CHRISTMAS.
Narrator: YOU KNOW,
THE TROUBLE WITH PATIENCE IS
WHEN YOU'RE WAITIN'
FOR SOMETHIN' TO HAPPEN,
TIME JUST SEEMS
TO SLOW DOWN.
BUT WISHES ARE WORTH
WAITIN' FOR,
NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES
OR WHAT GETS
IN YOUR WAY.
WHAT ARE YOU
UP TO NOW, AGNES?
I'VE COME
TO TAKE WILLIAM,
AND I HAVE
NO TIME TO DAWDLE.
OVER MY DEAD BODY.
UNFORTUNATELY THAT
WON'T BE NECESSARY.
THIS COURT ORDER
GIVES ME LEGAL CUSTODY
OF WILLIAM.
WHAT?!
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!
IT'S ALL RIGHT THERE,
CHARLES.
THE JUDGE AGREED WITH ME
THAT WILLIAM IS IN GRAVE
DANGER ON THIS FARM,
AND I SHALL HAVE
CUSTODY OF HIM
UNTIL WHICH TIME
HE CAN SPEAK.
AND THERE'S NOT
MUCH CHANCE
OF THAT HAPPENING,
IS THERE?
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!
IT'S TIGHT AS A DRUM.
IF YOU GIVE ME
ANY TROUBLE,
I SHALL CALL
THE AUTHORITIES.
WILLIAM, MY DEAR BOY!
COME TO AUNT AGNES!
OH...
YOU'LL LOVE
LIVING WITH ME.
HA HA HA!
I'M RICH.
NOW, RUN ALONG, WILLIAM,
AND GET YOUR THINGS.
AGNES...
BILLY AND ME...
WELL, WE'RE ALL
EACH OTHER'S GOT.
YOU GOT 30 MINUTES
TO HAVE HIM READY.
YOU GOT 30 MINUTES
TO HAVE HIM READY.
WE'LL BUY YOU
SOME DECENT CLOTHES,
AND WE'LL HAVE TO GET YOU
ENROLLED AT THE ACADEMY.
WELL, LET'S SEE,
AND A HAIRCUT.
MY AUTOMOBILE!
MY BEAUTIFUL
AUTOMOBILE!
OH! YOU HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THIS,
DIDN'T YOU, CHARLES?!
OH, AND DON'T DENY IT,
YOU SENILE OLD COOT!
WELL, IT WON'T
CHANGE A THING.
GET ME A TOW TRUCK
IMMEDIATELY!
WELL, IT'S
CHRISTMAS EVE, AGNES.
THE STATION'S CLOSED.
I'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE
IF I CAN GET SOMEONE
TO COME OUT HERE...
HA HA HA...
TOMORROW. HA HA HA.
TOMORROW?
WELL, I'M AFRAID THAT'S
THE BEST I COULD DO.
AT LEAST BILLY AND I
WILL HAVE ONE LAST
CHRISTMAS TOGETHER.
ONLY PART OF ONE,
CHARLES.
WE WILL BE LEAVING
IN THE MORNING...
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
Narrator: EARS WASN'T ABOUT
TO MISS THIS NIGHT,
THE ONE ANNABELLE
HAD WAITED A WHOLE YEAR FOR.
THE ONE ANNABELLE
HAD WAITED A WHOLE YEAR FOR.

ANNABELLE, WHAT'S

GRANDPA,
WHY ARE YOU CRYING?
WELL--WELL, THESE ARE
HAPPY TEARS, BILLY.
THIS IS THE BEST CHRISTMAS
PRESENT I EVER HEARD.
MAKE YOUR GOOD-BYES
AND WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY.
BILLY IS NOT GOIN' ANYWHERE

I LOVE MY GRANDPA.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
HESAID...

IS SHE SICK?
ANNABELLE'S
JUST FINE, BILLY.
YOU SEE, SHE GAVE HER
CHRISTMAS VOICE TO YOU.
YOU SEE, SHE GAVE HER
CHRISTMAS VOICE TO YOU.
SHE'LL NEVER TALK AGAIN.
BUT--BUT WHAT ABOUT
YOUR DREAM TO FLY?
THAT WAS GONNA
BE YOUR WISH.
NO, BILLY.
TO HEAR YOU TALK--
THATWAS
ANNABELLE'S WISH.
OH, ANNABELLE.
OH, ANNABELLE.
GUS! WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN' HERE?
ME AND MY BOYS HERE
OWE YOU AND YOUR BOY

NOW, GO AHEAD.
WE'RE, UH...
SORRY.
YEAH.
REAL SORRY.
I KNOW WE AIN'T BEEN
TOO NEIGHBORLY HERE LATELY,
BUT, WELL...
WHEN I HEARD YOU SOLD YOUR
DAUGHTER'S MUSIC BOX, I...
WELL, I WAS ASHAMED.
I KINDA THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
LIKE TO HAVE THIS BACK.
THANK YOU, GUS!

THIS MEANS MORE TO ME
THAN YOU'LL EVER KNOW.

WHAT SHE WANTED,
AND THE HOLDER BOYS

I'LL BE THERE

YOU KNOW I LIKE
TO VISIT THE ANIMALS
ON CHRISTMAS EVE.
HONESTLY, BILLY,
