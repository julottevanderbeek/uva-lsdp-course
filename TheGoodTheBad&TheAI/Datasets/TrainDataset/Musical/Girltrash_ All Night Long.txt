Experimenting posers, okay?
You're like in a sorority.

That's awesome.
What time do you go on?

Oh, great,

Hmm.

That's not funny.
Okay, seriously, off limits.

Drive.
I'm telling you the
radiator is toast.
Dammit.
I told you not to buy
this piece of shit van.
Dude, we've got to call
your fucking sister.
- No.
- Daisy.
Call her.
So, I hear you're gay now.
She's not gay.
Why can't I be gay?
Because I'm gay.
You're just copying me.
Well, you're so
full of yourself.
Oh my God, Colby,
you can't be gay.
Mom will kill you
and then me.
It's one thing if I'm gay
Because I'm kind of
a whole bad seed.
She tried to write me off.
But you, oh my God,
you're like the good egg.
Well, being the
good egg is boring.
Well, I'm sorry,
that's who you are.
Well, now I'm a
good gay egg, okay?
Yeah.
Come on.
Let her be a gay egg.
Thank you.
Colby, you've never even
touched your own vagina,
Let alone anyone else's.
**
I fuckin' hate this place.
This is ridiculous.
Hey, that's her.
Where?
In the green jacket.
Oh, she's hot.
I know.
- Yeah, she's out of your league.
- Shut up.
I'm sorry Colby, she is.
I mean, look at her,
she's like the queen bee
Of her little band of
baby dikes.
- She's an actress.
- Yuck.
Of course she's an actress.
Oh, what's she been in?
Oh, I saw her in this
allergy medication commercial,
And then she did this
movie Satan's Bride
I rented it,
she was really good.
You rented it?
Colby. God, you're a
creeper, seriously.
I just hope she remembers me.
I bought her latte last week.
She lost her wallet. So...
Dude, Colb, all you have to do
is go up there and talk to her.
Well, she can't
just walk up and say,
"Hey do you remember
I bought you a latte."
Well, why not?
Okay, because that girl right
there think she's king shit
Of Fuck Mountain, all right?
You just go up to her,
I promise you,
She will eat you for lunch.
You need an angle.
An angle?
Yeah.
You need something;
You know a wedge
to get her interested.
Well, isn't sex enough?
Colby's hot.
You think I'm hot?
Yeah.
- Ixnay on isteray.
- Okay.
I know pig Latin.
No, you don't know anything.
That's exactly my point.
You're not even gay.
What are we doing here?
- Oh, shut up.
- Whatever.
I'm just going to
go talk to her?
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Okay. So what's your...
What's your angle?
I thought you were nice
when I bought you that latte,
You made me laugh.
I think you're sexy and
I've never done this before,
But I'd like to sleep with you.
That's your angle?
Yeah.
Oh, she's dead.
Bye dead sister.
I loved you.
Oh stop.
I think she'll pull it off.
I mean, everyone
loves a bi-curious girl.
No, Tyler, let's just do.
She thought she had
a chance maybe...
Hey!
Hi.
I'm Colby.
I met you last week at
the Coffeewood on La Brea.
Okay.
- So...
- Yeah, you lost your wallet and,
Um, you were up at the barista,
but you didn't have any money
And I was behind you
in line and...
Right.
Yeah, yeah, hey.
Hey.
So, do you guys
come her a lot or...
Um, I guess.
Are you an actress because
I think I saw you in this movie
And it was really good.
Um, Satan's Bride.
- Hey, oh my God.
- How are you?
Wow, you cut your hair short.
Oh, yes, I chopped it off.
Do you like it?
Oh, my God, yes.
This is Shelby.
- Colby.
- Colby.
We met at the
Coffeewood on La Brea.
Hi.
Oh, shit. Sidney...
How are you?
- You look great.
- Oh, my God, no.
- How was it?
- Fucking great.
You guys are stupid.
I cannot begin to tell you.
I'll have to fill you guys in.
I mean,
do we have time to...
Yes, oh my God.
She wears her color well.
Okay, seriously,
this is painful.
- Can I please just go
over and stop her?
- Stop.
No, I'll tell her
she's got a phone call.
Well hey, I'm going to go,
But it was nice to
see you again.
Nice to see you too.
Who the fuck is that?
She's coming back.
I love this song...
Oh my God,
how did it go?
I'm going to die.
Happy? Asshole.
Tyler Murphy.
Yeah, that bitch
owe me money.
Yeah.
I am not your fuckin'
babysitter, all right?
You struck out, the
dream girl is not into you,
Time to call it a night,
I'm done.
Whatever, this is my car.
I have to do vocal
warm-ups, okay?
- I have to stretch.
- Oh, whatever.
I've had no water tonight,
I have a show.
Okay, that's when she
signed with endeavor.
But she sucks.
I know,
trust me, I hate her.
Hey.
Hey.
You guys have a light?
She does.
So you guys like,
actors or actresses,
I don't know.
What do you guys like
to be called these days?
It doesn't matter,
we're not either.
Speak for yourself.
Actors.
Yeah, I'm just mentioning
Because we're going
to this party
With some big casting
guys will be there.
Oh, really, what's his name?
I don't know.
It's my friend, Colby's uncle.
Come on.
I don't care.
Whatever.
I guess he represents
Angelina Jolie.
Angelina Jolie?
Really?
You can come if you want.
- Oh, my God we're so going.
- I can't. I can't. I can't.
- I can't even breathe right now.
- You've been obsessed with
her forever.
Okay, we're going,
come on.
- That was six years ago.
- Well, it was my favorite shirt.
- You gave it to me.
- Oh, like hell I did.
Sid and Misty are
coming at the party with us.
- Hey.
- Uh, what party?
You know, the party at
Colby's uncle's house.
My uncle?
Lets hit it.
Oh, my God.
- I swear to you, if you have
anything to do with this...
- No, no, no.
I will burn all of your CDs.
- No, I'm not kidding.
- Please, don't embarrass me.
Tyler, what are you doing?
I gave you an angle.
Okay. Well, she didn't
even have an uncle,
So sorry.
Well, then I guess
we'll have to find one.
Oh, Tyler, listen to me,
we don't have time for a,
Let's get Colby laid
mission tonight, okay.
We've got to get our
equipment at the Dark Light.
Where's your sense
of adventure?
I mean, this is your
sister's graduation night,
Let's give her a fuckin'
chance with this girl.
We have like, five hours
before we have to go on anyways.
Give me your keys.
Tyler, no... this
is all your fault.
What did I do?
Just play it cool.
Oh, great,
here comes nerd alert.
What?
Hey.
Hey.
So, uh, I hear you
guys are actors,
Is that right?
I mean, I've done some
modeling and acting,
And she's done acting.
So, do you like, mostly print
or like... what do you do?
You go to a lot of parties,
do you wear a lot of Ed Hardy,
Like, what do you do?
No, we go to a lot of like,
Hollywood parties.
I mean, that's how you
get connected this town.
You know, you have
to socialize.
It's part of the job.
Hey, do you guys have like,
agents and stuff
Or how do you do?
Yeah, we do, yeah.
Yeah, who's your agent?
It's like a little
boutique agency,
But I think they're
really specialized on...
Boutique? Do they have like,
perfume and shit there
Like, I don't understand.
No, it means small.
What have you been in?
I was in a couple of films,
But you probably wouldn't
know about them?
Really?
They're not with known names,
you guys would know.
But one day you'll know them.
- Like, one day we'll...
- Totally...
Your band is really
good you guys...
- Yeah.

You've seen us play?
Someone here
has seen you play.
Colby.
Colby is like, awesome.
You know, Colby you should take
them to come see us perform.
Hey, Tyler, do you
have a girlfriend?
Uh, do I know you?
Oh, I mean, I'm just wondering
if you have like, a type,
Like, maybe brunettes or...
- No, she doesn't...
- Do I have a type?
Oh a type, oh I'm sorry.
I don't even know how to
answer that question.
Why do you have like, many?
She's in a very open
relationship
With like, the population.
So she's not found
the right one yet, huh?
No, but she keeps trying.

So that was Colby's
Uncle Steve,
He wants us to meet him
at this club Coco Bongo
Which is downtown.
Oh, did you think, uh,
Angelina will be there?
Maybe.
My God.
Hey, Colby why don't you
tell Misty and Sid about
How Angelina hit on you
about one time.
What?
Yeah, remember
last summer, Colb?
So okay.
So Colby was on this yacht in
the Bahamas with her uncle
And Brad and Angelina.
And Maddox.
- Right. That's right.
- Yeah.
- Maddox.
- Yeah.
So everybody went
on the shore
Except for Colby
and Angelina.
- Really?
- No.
So when they were alone
Angelina asked Colby to put
suntan lotion on her back.
- No shit.
- Shut up.
And Colby whips out
the suntan lotion
And she starts rubbing it
all over Angelina.
What?
And then Angelina totally does
this reach around thing
And tries to get it on Colby.
- Shut up.
- No shit.
It's fine Colby, tell them.
Yes, Colby, what the fuck?
Yeah, tell them, Colby.
Come on.
Well.
Yeah. I mean,
it's just not big deal.
She's just being modest.
Oh Colby,
don't be shy, honey.
No, it's just we have all night.
Did that really happen?
Kind of.
Clarify "kind of?"
Did you guys hook up?
No, I mean... she's
married so...
Wait...
You didn't hook up with Angelina
Jolie because she's married?
Wait, well guys,
Brad came back.
Yeah, Brad came back so it
was kind of awkward and then...
Was he pissed?
No, no, no.
I mean, it was cool.
He was really nice.
Very nice, Brad Pitt.
- That is so cool.
- Wow.
Good guy.
If I almost fuck Angelina Jolie,
I would make a t-shirt that says
"I almost fucked
Angelina Jolie."
I mean,
are you kidding me?
You should totally do
that anyway because
Nobody would know the
difference, right?
I'm just watched G.I. too.
Why did you do that?
What?
Made up that stupid lie
About Angelina Jolie
making a pass on me.
Ah Colb,
here's a hot tip for you.
It's important to learn
how to lie to women.
Come on.
Seriously, you think
I'm joking, but I'm not.
You see, women want a fantasy;
they're all about the possible.
An angle will get you in the
door but a good set of lies,
That will close the deal.
That's terrible.
Look at her.
Do you want to be with her?
Yes.
Then tonight is your night.
Tonight is the only night.
There's no tomorrow,
there's just tonight.
So what are you going to do.
**
Listen to me, you have 45
minutes to make your move
Then we're out of here.
What the hell kind of move
am I suppose to make?
Well, if you're actually
gay you'd know.
Thanks.
Be strong.
Look how the hair
just hangs in her face.
Oh, my God, well
smile... go talk to her.
We were just in the
whole car with her.
- No. No. She has no...
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up with her?
Who?
Tyler.
Misty and her hot thing.
- What Tyler?
- No, no, no.
We didn't have a thing,
she doesn't remember me.
Okay,
they had an almost thing.
Oh... my gosh, no, I used
to go to see her play
When she was in
her old band.
You mean, Jaded Lipstick?
Yes.
- My mother is a bitch.
- Bitch.
- My mother is a bitch.
- Bitch.
I'm going to cut her breast off.
I know that my
mother is a bitch.
And I finally talk to her and
I gave her my number
And then she didn't call.
I shouldn't have put
my number on her arm,
She could have washed it off
or wiped it off or something.
Misty has been obsessed
with her ever since.
She doesn't remember me.
Remember she came over here,
tried to talk to us
And then had zero recollection
That we used to go see her
band play all the time.
Oh, there's guys, I'm going
to have them buy us drinks.
Has it ever happened to you?
You get a huge crush on
someone who didn't even know.
Yeah.
* Even though I know it's
never going to happen
* Fooling myself brings
me so much satisfaction
* Don't say a word but
she's my fantasy crush
* Oh that's funny,
I didn't know you dig sluts
Oh.
* Don't shit on my dream
it's just my fantasy
* Of what could possibly be,
but it won't be
* And the saddest part is that
it doesn't matter anyway
* Do you know what
I'm saying
Yeah.
I think I might feel on that.
Hmm.
* And in the Saturday dream
she takes me to the beach
* Then after hot fuckin' sex
she says she'll never leave
* Oh that's so sweet
* But see there's only
one problem
* She's so dirty she may
be allergic to water
* Don't shit on my dream
it's just my fantasy
* How could possibly be,
but it won't be
* And the saddest part is
that it doesn't matter anyway
* Do you know what I'm saying
* Well, there's this girl
that I really like
Well?
* Well, I don't know
her really, like
* And we get drawn
together one night
* A goose chase night
* This really super crazy night
* But she's got this
other chick that she likes
* Until she realizes that
the perfect girl
* Is sitting right here
* Don't shit on my dreams
it's just my fantasy
* Of what could possibly be
but it won't be.
* And the saddest part is that
it doesn't matter anyway
* Do you know what I'm saying.
* But anyway we're at
this party and it's wild
* It's like fiction and I lose
my inhibition and I kiss her
* And one thing leads
right into the next
* We end up on a trampoline
and I have first time sex
* It's just my fantasy
Whoa, hold the phone,
you're a chick virgin?
No, I'm not.
I mean I... did I say
that I was it was like, no.
Just... in my fantasy song,
you know it's my first time,
But she's... I've
done it like a million,
Trillion times.
I can't even count.
Right. Right.
Continue.
* So we're out this rock show
A really loud rock show
* She looks at me
it's like we both know
* That we need to seek
backstage
* And find a back room
* Back stage, sex rampage
* Don't shit on my dream
It's just my fantasy
* Of what could possibly be
but it won't be
* And the saddest part is
that it doesn't matter anyway
* On a beach, in a car
I fuckin' said you will never leave
* Don't shit on my dream
It's just my fantasy
* Of what could possibly
be but it won't be
* And the saddest part is
that it doesn't matter anyway
* Backstage, at a show,
my first time sex, trampoline
* Don't shit on my dream
It's just my fantasy
* Of what could possibly be
but it won't be
* And the saddest part is
that it doesn't matter anyway
* I think you know
what I'm saying
You're such a romantic.
Too bad the shit
doesn't happen
In real life though, right?
Come on,
let's go find Sid.
Listen, I don't know why
you're bothering with Colby.
This whole thing is like
an exercise in futility.
Valentine, this guy,
he's a con artist.
Exactly.
I need you to do me a
favor for like, five minutes.
I don't know,
what's there for me?
Don't get any bright idea's,
hot shot.
You still owe us for
the fucking Lambert.
Is that Zan?
Yeah.
I'll be right back.
- Daisy, don't go.
- Be back.
Daisy.
Misty, I have to
tell you something.
Oh, guys,
they're so easy.
Where have you been?
I got us drinks.
Back off.
Hey, sweet cheeks.
How are you doing?
Sid, Misty, this is
Colby's uncle Steve.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
It's always nice to meet
Colby's attractive friends.
Hey, Colby, I haven't seen
you since Clooney's poker game.
What?
You played poker with Clooney?
Yeah.
He's an old friend.
So what do you
guys doing out here,
The party is on the dance floor.
Come on.
- Bono is stopping by later...
- Wait, Bono!
Yeah, Bono.
Who the hell is that perv?
Oh, it's a guy, I know.
Hey, I need you
to do me a favor.
I need you to have
sex with me.
What?
If I want to get together Misty
I have to get together
with you first.
I don't follow you.
Well, this was your whole
idea in the first place, Tyler.
I mean, I'm trying to like,
work a freakin' angle here.
So, I was thinking if I
hook up with you first,
Then Misty won't think that
I'm a square anymore
And she'll feel all like,
jilted and insecure
Because you didn't
hook up with her
And then you hook up
with me on the rebound.
It could work.
I'm telling you.
Colby,
As much as this
pains me to tell you,
I cannot have sex you.
You see, your
sister will kill me.
Oh, who cares about her?
I do.
Who cares?
Okay, tonight is the night.
You said so yourself.
What about fake sex?
How are we supposed
to have fake sex?
I don't know,
but I'll figure it out, okay.

Hey, Zan.
Can I talk to you?
Oh, look it's Alotta Lame.
My name is a
Alotta Flame... Flame.
You guys are going
to Band Slam tonight.
- That should be interesting.
- Yeah, whatever, Kelly.
Listen Zan,
I gotta talk to you, so...
Daisy, now is not
really a good time.
Well, when?
I mean, when is a good time?
Because you didn't even have the
courtesy to break up with me.
I had to find out that you're
dating Skankoroma here
Through your fucking tweet.
What on earth do you
need to talk about?
I mean, how many times you have
to process this relationship.
She dumped you.
You're a loser.
She's not.
End of story.
Yeah.
Okay, Kelly, um,
Why don't you butt out of this
Because if you don't
I swear to God...
You're going to what,
kill me with your music?
Too late.
Listen, you and your
slutty hoe-bag friend
And your desperado band
Need to go crawling under
a rock somewhere
And leave Zan alone.
Guys come one.
Hey!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Get out!
Get out of here!
Oh my God,
Just that one time when
I got her really good...
Oh, she backed up...
- She got on top of me.
- Totally.
She's on top of me.
And she's not light.
Let me tell you
that hurt a little bit.
But I think Zan, there's a
moment we connected eyes,
She was like a little
impressed by my moves.
Monique?
What's up, ladies?
They let you out?
For good behavior.
Congratulations.
Well, thank you.
They say I'm rehabilitated.
You see, Dr. Floss who teaches
my anger management class.
He says that he's really proud
of the progress that I made
And getting to the source of my
general fuckin' irritation with life.
- Are they friends?
- I don't think so.
Dr. Floss, he says that I have
an excellent chance
Of returning to society
And making a meaningful
contribution in my community.
Dr. Floss is going to be really
fuckin' disappointed
When he finds out I beat you within
an inch of your funckin' life.
You owe me $4565.79.
Monique, I didn't
steal your money.
It was fucking Louanne.
You're looking at
me like I care.
Hey, Monique,
I'm begging your pardon.
Tyler will totally
get your money,
I have like,
every confidence,
But right now, we got
to get to sound check
Because we're playing a
rock show tonight
- and I like to be professional...
- Easy.
What, this little
fuckin' rock show,
Band Slam?
Band Slam?
Yeah, that's it.
- Daisy.
- Yeah, this is it.
Daisy.
Y'all in a rock in roll
band now, right
No, it's lame.
No... it's nothing...
- Oh, she's right...
- That's cute. That's cute.
Yeah. I think we have like,
a really good chance.
And I bet you all bitches need
these instruments right here
To play a little fuckin'
show tonight, right?
Oh, yeah. No. No.
I'll tell you what,
I'm going to hold
onto your shit.
You give me my fuckin' money,
I can give you back your shit,
Sound good?
- You know that's my car.
- Colby.
What?
- This piece of shit as you are.
- Hey...
Okay, my dad is a lawyer.
What did you say, bitch?
What bitch?
What?
I ain't fuckin'
playing around, bitches.
- Monique. Monique.
- Shut the fuck up.
You don't understand
the gravity
Of the mother-fucking'
situation here.
You need to give me my
mother-fucking' money.
Your shit is my shit.
Midnight, bitches.
You stay...
Hey Monique, could I just
grab one thing at the back
Just before you go?
Monique. Monique.
Oh my God.
Monique. Monique.
Don't do this...
Daisy, she stole my car.
I know Colby, I know.
I know.
Oh...
Hey guys.
I see Monique
repossessed your car.
Fuck off, Kelly.
She's performing
a public service.
Yeah. And nobody has to
hear your shitty band.
You fuckin' suck anyway.
What are you doing?
Oh my God!
What are you doing?!
Tyler, what are you doing?!
Go.
Come on.
You guys are insane.
This is amazing.
This is the best night
of my life.
Oh, my God.
I know it's going to get better.
Look in the glove compartment.
Why?
Why, what is it?
What? What?
Hidden compartment
on the right?
What is it?
How do you know this?
What?
What is it?
If I'm correct...
What the hell?
- No fucking way.
- What the fuck.
Are you joking me right now?
How did you know it
was going to be there?
Oh, my fucking hell,
that's a lot of dope.
- What kind of people are these?
- Don't get close...
Oh my God.
Lets just take a look.
I didn't know my ex was
going out with Courtney Love,
Dear God.
Oh...
Who is it?
It's fucking Zan.
No, don't pick it up.
Don't pick it up.
I want to talk to her.
Tell her I drive
things with the drugs.
Alright, shut up.
Shh, shh.
Good day, Zan.
Daisy, I don't know what
the fuck is going on
But you have to bring
Kelly's car back.
Oh, no, no, no, we
will totally bring it back.
We just, you know, we need to
borrow it for a little while.
Do you think this is a joke?
Make Tyler bring the car back or
Kelly is going to call the cops.
The only reason she hasn't
called the cops yet
Is because I stopped her.
Oh, really?
Because I wonder what the
police will think about the full
Fuckin' pharmacy Kelly has
gotten in her glove compartment.
You had drugs in the
glove compartment?
Really?
Listen, you loser.
I want you to bring
my car back
With everything in it.
Hey, guys, guys, what do
you think there's like,
$10,000 worth of drugs?
- Yeah.
- Or like $15,000. I don't know.
That's a lot of jail time,
yeah, I don't know.
We got a lot of money tonight.
Yeah, I want to talk to Zan.
You just talked to her.
No, no, I want to talk to her
without you present in person
And then we'll give you your
shitty little car back, okay?
She wants me to meet her.
I don't know if you're worth
all this fucking trouble.
Oh, she snapped.
Where are you?
I'll tell you what,
I will text you when we land.
For the record, this is why.
Okay.
This is why what?
Why I broke up with you.
Oh my God,
this is funny guys...
Dude, what did she say?
You know, she said, sorry,
it's wrong to leave you,
I love you.
I always will.
What did she really say?
Where the fuck are we going?
Well, we have to
unload these drugs;
We can get our $5000,
Pay Monique and then
get our shit back.
How are we going to unload
$5000 worth of drugs
in three hours?
We got to be on stage
at 1 a.m.
I don't know.
Hey, maybe Lana will
want to buy them.
Bitch, do you have
a death wish?
No, we have to
find some like rich,
Obnoxious, drunk kids who
are looking for a good time
And sell them the drugs.
Hey, my eyes are peeled.
No.
Oh yeah.
No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- Oh yes.
- Hell, no.
- No. No...
- Oh, fuck yeah.
It's happening Colby, done.
Done.
You can't do shit.
Colby.
Colby. Colby. Colby...
Yes, Colby.
It's your graduation night.
It's easy, We're going to send
your friends off with a bang.
Yeah and I have six demerits.
- I'm going to be like...
- You are such a...
My sister is such bad girl.
When did you get
so bad, Colby?
These girls are really...
And I haven't even
told them about...
Me...
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.
Halloween is in October,
ladies.
Hi, Lauren.
Um, I just came
to grab my jacket.
Colby, we made a pact
To spend our last night
together as sorority sisters
Here in this house
Reflecting on four great
years here at LAU.
We could be out partying or
hanging with our boyfriends,
But instead we made a solemn
pledge to be here together.
Everybody here is here but you.
You for some reason
Seemed to think you have
something better to do
Than to participate in
the Sigma Omega Kappa
Farewell ceremony.
What could possibly be
more important
Than spending tonight with
your sigma sisters?
Sex with Misty.
Ow, my tit...
Lauren...
Was I finished talking?
I don't think so.
My followup question is this.
What do you think you can do
to make up for this selfish
And insulting behavior
on your part?
What are you bringing
to the table, Colby.
Uh, party favors.
**
Everyone makes fun of me
whenever I talk about it.
Did you have to wear like,
a uniform in space camp?
Yes.
- Do you still fit in it?
- I do.
Do you know who's
Story Musgrave was?
He's an astronaut.
I bought every button from
every launch he had ever done.
I used to dream of being
like, a counselor there.
That was my goal at 15.
- I didn't get that.
- Oh.
So I choose acting.
And here you are in LA?
Yes.
- I hate LA.
- Why?
It's not just what I expected.
Everybody is so fake.
I don't know.
I miss New York.
You should really give
LA a chance.
You see LA,
it's like a treasure chest,
There's all sorts of hidden gems
all over the place
You just have to know
how to look for them.
You see other cities
are really slutty,
They just have
everything out there to see.
There's no mystery.
But LA,
she makes it work.
I don't know.
No, listen.
If you drive downtown,
There's this crappy electronic
store in Sixth Street,
But if you go through the store
and then in the storeroom
With a flashlight,
you can look up in the rafters
And see the remnants of
the first vaudeville
Built in LA.
That's so cool.
Yeah.
And then if you drive in
the Santa Monica Mountains,
The second week of April,
there are acres and acres
Of blooming wild flowers
everywhere.
You guys don't have seasons.
That's not true.
Just not the ones
that you're used to.
But if you've lived
here long enough,
You can detect the subtle changes
and the quality of the light
And feel of the air.
I don't know you can't
just look at the surface.
You got to look beneath.
Well, maybe I had the wrong
person showing me around.
So, do we have a winner yet?
A winner of what?
Come on, who's going to
hook up with Tyler first?
Hey Colby,
Lauren needs you.
I'll be right back.
Ah-hmm.
What?
What is up with you?
She's cute.
Oh, come on, Misty.
The hottest fucking girl
on the entire West Coast
Is ready to your bed bitch.
So get your fucking
head in the game.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. That's right, yeah.
Thank you.
Okay.
So you wanted to talk,
let's talk.
So, I saw Fat Sal
the other day.
Yeah?
Yeah.
He was asking about you.
Are you happy?
Yeah.
Does she make you laugh?
Daisy, what do you want?
I want you to be
honest with me.
No, you don't.
People say it all the time,
but nobody actually wants that.
No, I do.
Zan, I love you.
I mean, do you feel
anything for me like at all
Or the last nine months
- just some weird
hallucination on my part?
- No.
No, of course, I loved you.
Of course.
It's not just enough.
How can that not be enough?
It's not enough because I
can't spend the rest of my life
Waiting for you and Tyler
to get your shit together.
Oh, I don't know,
we're together.
You know, we got like a
couple of irons in the fire;
Things are... things are...
Daisy, I have to go.
Give me the keys.
I wrote a song for you.
Um, I don't want your song.
What?
I don't want your song, Daisy
Because this is over
and I don't want you.
I don't want your song.
I really actually don't want
anything to do with your life.
I just want Kelly's car back.
What does she have
that I don't?
- Daisy, you have to let me go.
- What does she have?
She has talent.
She has talent, I'm sorry.
Give me the keys.
Thank you.

nice girls end up right?

Hmm.
Okay.
I have something to tell you.
I'm pretty sure that I'm gay.
Duh.
Duh?
Seriously?
Intramural softball.
Oh, my god.
Do you know how
to have fake sex?
Um,
I don't understand the question.
Like, if I was to simulate sex
without actually having it,
What would I do?
Moan a lot and swear.
Really?
Huh.
Ah. Ah. Ah.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Hmm.
Oh, God.
Oh, fuck, fuck.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, God.
Fuck. Fuck. OK. OK.
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
I could never say that.
Oh, and if you bust this one
out it will drive them crazy.
Oh, shit.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit.
Oh... you make me
so... you make me so wet...
I know.
Wow.
Okay, look,
I need your help.
You know, I actually remember
when I saw you guys first play.
- No shit.
- Yeah.
It was like last September.
Where was it?
Um, I don't know it
was like some dark,
Burgundy room
with tall ceilings.
- Oh, was it the dark room?
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- Yes.
That's a fuckin' awesome place.
I love it.
Hey, can you, um...
Can you tell he change
in the seasons in LA?
What?
I mean, like you've
lived here your whole life,
Like, can you feel the change?
There are no fuckin'
seasons in LA.
It's just hot
and fuckin' hotter.
Yeah, I know.
Hi.
Do you mind if we Misty
for a second?
Why?
You've been chosen.
It's actually a great honor.
Every year, one civilian is
chosen to participate
In the annual crossing
over ceremony.
I'm good.
Thank you though.
It's not optional.
Come on, show time.
Take off your clothes
and get in the bed.
To cherish these
friendships forever.
To cherish these
friendships forever.
To be bonded in
everlasting sisterhood.
To be bonded in
everlasting sisterhood.
I mean,
not like the lessy kind.
I mean,
not like the lessy kind.
I mean, that's fine for Colby,
if that's where she's sent to,
No judgments,
but most of us like dick.
I mean, that's fine for Colby,
if that's where she sent to,
No judgments,
but most of us like dick.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Ah, you guys are
totally freaking me out.
Congratulations, you are now
officially a civilian sister
Of Sigma Omega Kappa.
Thanks.
Oh, um, do you know
where my friends went?
- I think they went upstairs.
- Thanks.
Incoming.
Okay.
Let's do it.
Hey, we're going to
be late for Monique.
Do you understand
it's like Monique...
No. Hey.
We're like five minutes away.
It will be fine.
I have to do this.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, yes.
Oh, fuck, yes, Tyler.
Whoa!
Tyler, you are making
me so wet.
Oh, my God.
Oh, Tyler. Tyler.
You fuck my sister.
No. No. Daisy.
Daisy this is not what
it looks like, I swear.
Daisy.
- You are fucking dead to me.
- No. Daisy.
Daisy.
Oh, man.
Daisy. Stop it.
Nothing happened.
Oh, nothing happened?
I just saw you in bed
fucking my little sister.
- No, we were faking it.
- Oh you were faking it?
Colby had this
cockamamie plan
If Misty walked in on us
and thought we're having sex,
Then she would
think Colby was cool
And then they would
go have sex.
Okay.
So, I'm expected to believe
My little sister asked you to
have some fake sex with her
- in order to get some other girl.
- Yeah.
- Oh, I can't believe it.
- I know. Daisy.
She's just a kid.
She's Gail's age.
She's not a kid anymore,
Daisy.
What did you just say to me?
I mean, she's graduating
from college tomorrow,
She's not a kid anymore.
I knew it.
Man, I fucking knew it.
You've been crushing
on Colby for years.
Just waiting to get your
whore little hands all over her.
Well, let me tell
you something, Tyler,
It's never going
to happen, okay,
Colby is way too good for you.
So you better forget you
knew either one of us.
And you're out of
the fucking band!
* Don't shit on my dream
It's just my fantasy
* Of what could possibly be
but it might be
* And the greatest thing is
it's going to happen anyway
* Do you know what
I'm saying
Hey.
Hey, Misty.
Get off me.
I'm sorry.
I'm just...
It's not going to happen, okay.
Okay.
Misty, are you okay?
What happened?
Nothing. I just made a
huge fool out of myself.
I know how you feel.
I just thought we would
have had something.
I'm so stupid.
I always do this
and I don't know why
I just threw myself at Tyler.
Then she acted like
I was a leper.
Am I that disgusting?
No.
You're beautiful.
- I can't stay.
- Misty.
I have known Tyler
my entire life.
She's like the best friend my
sister could ever have
And she may be hot, but
All Tyler cares about
is smoking pot
And looking cool
playing her bass.
I just feel like you've been
making up all this stuff
About her,
but none of it is real.
But I like my fantasies.
With fantasies you don't
have with the real person
And that's scarier.
A lot scarier.
It's like, you have a
connection with somebody
Then you have to let them in.
And what if they don't
like what they find?
What if they do?
Stupid, fucking bitch,
What the hell is she thinking.
Ding-dong, bitch.
Ah!
- No. No. No.
- Where's Tyler?
Where's Tyler?
What's you running for?
What's you running for?
Ah!
Get the fuck out of here.
What is fucking
wrong with you all?
Y'all going to fuck around
and make me break a sweat.
Ray Charles could see
y'all mother-fuckers
Hiding under the...
Ah!
What's wrong with y'all?
Where is your
girlfriend at, blondie?
Tell her I'm looking for her.
Now that you're
fucking with me,
I'm going to start taxing
everyone of this Sigma bitches.
Ah!
Where the fuck do you
think you're going, huh?
Keep fucking with me...
Ah!
- Where the fuck do you...
- Freeze!
Oh, please, toy cop.
Officer Jackie.
Officer Margie.
Campus police.
Yeah, campus police.
Kids today,
no respect for the law.
No, ma'am.
No respect.
Yeah.
I've been after you little
sorority misses for a while now,
Waiting for you to
slip up and pounce.
It would appear that
Monique Shaniqua Jones
Is in violation of the
terms of her parole.
Proper authorities
have been notified.
Fuck you, bitch.
And as for you ladies,
Your parents have
been contacted.
You called my mom?
Happy graduation, ladies.
Great. Wow.
This is just fucking great.
Great.
Well, this is fucking great.
Yeah.
- Daisy.
- Don't you talk to me.
It was a mistake, okay.
I can't deal with you
not talking to me.
Oh, well maybe you should
have thought about that
Before you screwed my
little sister, do you think.
Hmm.
Yeah, maybe perhaps, okay.
- You guys hooked up?
- No.
That's an understatement.
Oh, Tyler, Tyler.
Fuck me, Tyler.
Dah.
Why didn't you telling me?
This whole ridiculous evening
has been one big fat lie.
Yeah.
That's been Colby's
strategy the whole time.
For instance, our uncle,
not Angelina Jolie's agent.
We don't even have an uncle.
So who was that guy?
His name is Valentine.
He's a con artist.
Oh, man.
You mean I hooked up
with him for nothing?
What? He said he was going
to introduce me to Beyoncé.
The craziest lie of all is
that Colby is not even gay.
I don't know what kind of bullshit
pulls or game she's playing,
But I'll tell you what,
it's getting real tired.
You've been lying to
me this whole time.
No, it wasn't like that.
I mean, it was kind of like that,
but you wouldn't talk to me.
Tyler said that I needed an
angle so I tried to fix things
So that you would like me and...
Oh, you guys were in
this the whole time.
Misty, I'm really,
really truly sorry.
Save it.
Forget it.
Are you happy?
- This night get any worse.
- Ladies, you have a visitor.
Mom.
You know what
you guys are,
You're professionally ungrateful.
And get me up in the
goddamn middle of the night.
Maybe you could get a job and
be professionally delinquent.
You guys are all worthless,
you know that...
* Lately out here on my own
* Surrounded by heartbeats
never felt more alone
* What's happening
* So why does everyone
look the other way
* When I'm right here
and I want to say
* Here I am, once again,
stuck in traffic
* Count to 10,
trying not to panic
* Red light, green light
Whoa, uh, oh
* Broke the rules
down to the letter
* Let me try it once again,
I can do it better
* Red light, green light
Whoa, uh, oh
* Here I am once again
Here I am once again
* Here I am once again
* People flying out their cars
* Forgetting and regretting
can only get a girl so far
* So where you going, going
* Like little Boeings,
Boeings, yeah
* Didn't ya see the red light
* God knows how I hate
to say, I told you so
* What ya lookin' at me for
* I'm no help,
the future is a ghost
* Here I am, once again,
stuck in traffic
* Count to 10,
trying not to panic
* Red light, green light
Whoa, uh, oh
* Broke the rules
down to the letter
* Let me try it once again,
I can do it better
* Red light, green light
Whoa, uh, oh
* God knows I hate to say
* God knows I hate to say
* Here I am once again
Here I am once again
* Here I am once again
Here I am once again
* Here I am once again
You're as delinquent
as your sister.
What's the freakin'
holdup here?
Mom, are you coming to my
graduation tomorrow night?
I told you Colby,
I'm going to San Diego
with Greg.
Oh great, throw a tantrum.
Do you want me to
treat you like an adult,
Well you better
start acting like one.
Fuck stake.
Fuck.
Huh.
Go on,
what are you waiting for?
I don't even know you.
Colby.
Colby, would you hold up?
I don't want to talk to you.
Oh really?
Well, I don't want to
talk to you either.
That's why it's a good
thing we're sisters,
We have to talk to
one another.
Look I was a jerk, okay.
I'm sorry that I'm having such
a hard time with this Colby.
It's just that...
You know, it's not like mom
was exactly around a lot.
It's always been
just the two of us
And I was the one,
you know,
Helping you with your
homework
Or taking you to school
Or picking up the pieces when
you broke up with that guy
And then this guy and
now girls, good God.
Colby, do you like girls?
Girls are all fucking nightmare.
But this night is
any indication.
Look, I just don't want to
see you get heartbroken.
It's my heart to break.
It hurts me all the same.
I'm not in the habit of
being honest with girls,
But if we had
hooked up tonight,
We would have had
a good time,
But I wouldn't
have called you back.
And then I just would have
moved on to somebody else.
I'm the one that
put Colby up to
This whole crazy night,
okay?
She doesn't have a
lying bone in her body.
So, um...
Where are we headed?
Dark Light.
You're out already?
You just went in an hour ago.
Overcrowding.
Drive.
* You think it's you and her
* Against the world now
* Until you're bloody
on the floor
* Saying I'm too bad yeah
- Hey, you're going
to be amazing.
- Thanks, man.
Uh, see you in a while,
wish me luck.
- Oh, I got to go.
- Oh, see ya.
- Goodbye, goodbye.
- Rock it.
* You're all hi
* She's all hello
Oh, hi Daisy,
what the hell?
- It's a long story.
- We're on in 10.
I can't believe you guys
actually showed.
Huh.
Hey, news flash,
There's a real live
audience out there.
I mean, this isn't like
performing at home
In front of a mirror
with a hair brush.
Do you guys really think
that you're ready for this
Because I'm embarrassed
for you in advance.
Next up.
Let's give a warm Dark Light
welcome to the Dollyrots.
Zan.
I just think your music
isn't for everybody, sorry.
Oh, yeah real nice, Zan,
After she spent eight long
ass months with you.
Nine.
* Because I'm happy
so happy
* Joy oh joy
We stink.
No, we don't.
Daisy, look she's just
trying to get you in your head.
I'm going to make
a fool of myself.
Tyler, we're going to
make fools of ourselves.
Daisy!
* And every time I kissed
your mouth so sweet
* I still wonder how it's me
* It makes me happy
so happy
* Joy oh joy
* It's for always
You're my never
gonna happen crush.
What?
You're it.
You're my fantasy girl.
Drama.
You know,
every day of my life
I have to pretend to be
somebody I'm not.
I have to be fake with
all this other fake people.
But for some reason I
thought that you were for real.
I thought that you were
the only real person
I had ever met in LA.
But you turned out to be
phony just like everybody else.
Misty, I get you.
Okay, I get your whole thing.
I mean, I know in New York
you had a ton of friends
And then you moved here
and in Hollywood,
No one cares about who
you are or what you think.
But I do.
And I think that
space camp is awesome.
Look, I know what's it like to
pretend to be something
That you're not and
I'm tired of doing that.
I just want you to know that you
don't have to pretend with me
Because I just liked you.
I'm sorry that
I ruined your night.
No, Colby, wait.
What if we just
start from scratch?
Hi.
I'm Colby.
* Why don't we
* Try to be
* Honest even though
it's hard
* Now is the time to start
* Don't you see
* I happily
* Accept you as you are
* Now we got nothing to hide
Come here, I want to
show you something.
* You're high to me
* Tell me it's not happening
* Am I just the parody
* With my best behind me
I'm sorry, man.
She's just a heat seeking
missle, you know.
When you're up,
she's up,
And you're down,
she's gone.
I just thought she
believed in me, you know.
I believe in you.
Come on.
You kind of have to
say that, you know.
No, I don't.
I know you and I've
seen you rock every day.
And we can't shut you up.
You love to rock.
Whenever you ever give it a
shit what other people think?
Fuck it, right?
- Fuck it.
- Fuck it.
Vote for us the Dollyrots.
Whoa. All right.
Next up,
we got Alotta Flame.
Let's take it again, guys.
* Listen up
* Once upon a time
she was all strung up
* And now she's
dancing in the road
* Well, the story got wicked
and the song was the ticket
* Fast forward to tonight
* We've all grown
The past is left alone
* When we look inside
and see what's true
* My friends, myself,
the night of our life
* I'm taking it back
like Goonies do
* We only win when
we decide to
* Now all my nights
will have an asterisk
* Much happier without you
* And as I walk out here,
here's an ass to kiss
* My tomorrow is
all brand new
* So now
* Sometimes my head
sounds like there's
* Nothing lasts forever
but stories and stone
* But we've got a tale
to tell you
* And the stone and well
it should have been
* It should have been left alone
It should have been left alone
* It should have been left alone
It should have been left alone
* Leave me alone
* Give me five minutes alone
* Leave me alone
* My night will
have an asterisk
* Much happier without you
* As I walk out here,
here's an ass to kiss
* Because missy
it's the end
* My darling,
don't come calling
* Just get lost
once and for all
* Stay the fuck away
* Now the gig is up
* Time to give me back
* Everything you ever took
* Come on, come on
* Now the gig is up
* Time to give me back
everything you ever took
Whoa, all right.
What a show.
Alotta Flame, people.
And it looks like we
have ourselves a winner.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Alotta Flame.
Here's your prize $5000.
Yes.
Uh-hmm.
- Hi, Monique.
- Hey.
- No. Really.
- Yeah.
Well, okay.
This shit,
bet not bounce.
* They try to hold us back
but we're just too much
* You know they cannot hold
what they cannot touch
* All the lights are green
on the avenue
Happy graduation.
* And we can say goodbye
to the place we've been
* All I need I found in you
* We waited out whole lives
* To finally make it here
* Darling what's the catch
* Is it too good to be real
* Where would I be now
* If it weren't for you
* I hope this never ends
I hope this never ends
* You call my name
at the starting line
* And I'm ready to go
with you by my side
* There's no holding back
this time
* It's all right
if I think too much
* Because you know my cards
and you call my bluff
* But we don't need to
be like everyone
* We waited our whole lives
to finally make it here
* Darling what's the catch
* Is it too good to be real
* Where would I be now
if it weren't for you
* I hope this never ends
* Oh, I hope this never ends
* if you feel alone
it's only for a moment
* if you feel alone
it's only for a moment
* if you feel alone
it's only for a moment
* Because we're coming home
* We're coming home
* We waited our whole lives
to finally make it here
* Darling what's the catch
* Is it too good to be real
* Where would I be now
if it weren't for you
* I hope this never ends
* I hope this never ends
* We waited out whole lives
to finally make it here
