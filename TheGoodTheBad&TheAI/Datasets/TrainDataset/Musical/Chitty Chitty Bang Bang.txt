VROOM! VROOM!
VROOM! VROOM!
VROOM! VROOM!
VROOM! VROOM!
HANG ON,
WE'RE COMING TO A BEND.
YOU'RE GOING TOO FAST!
WHAT'S THIS HEAP
OF OLD IRON DOING HERE?
I'LL GIVE YOU
THIS WAS ONCE
A GREAT CAR.
WON THE GRAND PRIX
THREE YEARS RUNNING.
SO IT'S A CAR,
IS IT?
IT'S A RACING CAR.
AND WE'RE WINNING.
YOU'RE IN THE WAY.
I'LL BELT YOUR EAR
IF I HAVE ANY MORE
OF YOUR LIP.
I'LL GIVE 15 BOB
FOR IT.
MAKE IT 30.
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
SELL HER, ARE YOU?
OF COURSE HE IS.
HE'S NOT RUNNING
A CHILDREN'S PLAYGROUND.
I'LL PICK HER UP
WEDNESDAY.
BUT YOU PROMISED
WE COULD PLAY IN HER.
I'M SORRY, BUT SHE
AIN'T ANY USE TO ME.
BUT YOU CAN'T
TAKE HER AWAY.
SHE'S NOT JUST
ANY OLD CAR.
SHE'S OURS.
NOT ANYMORE.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
WHAT WILL
YOU DO WITH HER?
WE'LL PUT HER
IN THE CLAPPER
AND CRUNCH HER UP
INTO ONE PIECE OF METAL.
THEN WE'LL PUT HER
IN THE FIERY FURNACE
AND MELT HER DOWN
TILL SHE'S LIQUID IRON.
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
YOU'VE FRIGHTENED HER.
SHE SHIVERED.
SHE'S A VERY
SPECIAL CAR.
IF YOU BURN HER,
IT'LL BE MURDER.
IF YOU DON'T
GET OUT OF IT,
I'LL BE GUILTY
OF TWO MORE MURDERS.
GIDDY-UP!
MR. COGGINS, YOU CAN'T
SELL OUR LOVELY CAR
TO THAT NASTY MAN.
I'M SORRY, CHILDREN,
BUT I'M AFRAID
I ALREADY HAVE.
I KNOW!
DADDY WILL
BUY IT FOR US!
PROMISE YOU WON'T
LET IT GO
UNTIL WE COME BACK.
NOT A PENNY LESS.
PLEASE PROMISE.
PLEASE.
ALL RIGHT.
I PROMISE.
COME ON, JEMIMA.
OOH!
THAT'S A CLEVER THING
TO DO!
WE'RE SORRY, MISS.
I'M SURE YOU ARE.
WELL!
JUST LOOK AT MY CAR
AND LOOK WHAT A MESS
I'M IN, TOO.
OH, NO.
I THINK YOU'RE
BEAUTIFUL.
AND I LIKE
YOUR CAR.
YOU SHOULDN'T BE RUSHING
ACROSS THE ROAD LIKE THAT.
YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN KILLED.
ANYWAY, WHY AREN'T YOU
IN SCHOOL?
IT ISN'T A HOLIDAY,
IS IT?
NO, MISS.
DO YOU LIVE
AROUND HERE?
YES, DOWN THE ROAD.
GET INTO MY CAR.
I'M TAKING YOU HOME.
JUST WAIT
TILL DADDY HEARS
WE'VE BEEN
FOR A RIDE
IN A MOTORCAR!
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
I'M JEMIMA.
AND I'M JEREMY.
WHAT'S YOURS?
TRULY.
THAT'S PRETTY.
NOW, WHERE
IS YOUR HOUSE?
WE LIVE IN A CASTLE
ON TOP OF A HILL.
I DIDN'T KNOW
THERE WERE ANY CASTLES
AROUND HERE.
IT ISN'T A CASTLE EXACTLY.
THAT'S WHAT
DADDY CALLS IT.
HE SAYS KING ALFRED
USED TO LIVE THERE.
DOES YOUR DADDY KNOW
YOU AREN'T IN SCHOOL?
HE WON'T MIND.
HE NEVER DOES.
ANYWAY,
HE'S AWFULLY BUSY.
IS HE?
HE'LL HAVE TO
FIND TIME TO SEE ME.
I HAVE A FEW THINGS
TO SAY TO HIM.
EDISON! EDISON!
COME HERE, BOY!
GOOD BOY.
THAT'S DADDY
OVER THERE.
HELLO!
HELLO!
HELLO.
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME.
WHAT IS HE UP TO?
THAT'S HIS LATEST
INVENTION--ROCKETS.
ROCKETS?
STAND BACK.
KEEP CLEAR!
HOORAY!
HOORAY!
DOES HE KNOW
WHAT HE'S DOING?
OF COURSE.
WHOA!
WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!
WHOA!
YEEHA!
I DON'T SEE
ANYTHING FUNNY.
SOMEBODY SHOULD
DO SOMETHING.
HOLD ON! HOLD ON!
WAIT! WAIT THERE.
UH!
OH!
WHEW! THANK YOU!
WELL, I SHOULD HOPE SO.
YOU MIGHT HAVE
GONE UP IN FLAMES.
THIS SUIT IS
COMPLETELY FLAMEPROOF.
YOU HAVE JUST SUCCEEDED
IN RUINING
MY PROPULSION UNIT.
HOW WAS I TO KNOW?
DON'T BE CROSS
WITH THE LADY.
SHE GAVE US
A RIDE IN HER CAR.
MR. POTTS,
I NEARLY KNOCKED DOWN
YOUR TWO CHILDREN.
WE SEEM TO BE
ACCIDENT-PRONE,
DON'T WE?
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.
IT WAS NICE OF YOU
TO APOLOGIZE.
TEA TIME, CHILDREN.
DON'T YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOUR FATHER?
DADDY, MR. COGGINS
PROMISED US--
SHE DIDN'T MEAN
ABOUT THAT.
DADDY.
WE DIDN'T GO
TO SCHOOL TODAY.
IT'LL GIVE
THE OTHER CHILDREN
A CHANCE
TO CATCH UP.
RUN ALONG, CHILDREN.
GOODBYE, TRULY.
COME ON, EDISON.
BUT, MR. POTTS--
GOOD DAY.
UNSTABLE.
BUT--
HEY! HEY!
GOOD AFTERNOON, MISS.
SORRY I CAN'T STOP.
I'M OFF TO INDIA.
GOING TO HAVE TEA
WITH THE MAHARAJAH.
CHEERIO.
MR. POTTS.
MR. POTTS.
I'M SORRY
TO PERSIST ABOUT THIS,
BUT PERHAPS
YOU SIMPLY AREN'T AWARE
THAT YOUR CHILDREN
WERE RUNNING ABOUT
IN THE ROAD.
IT'S NOT A PLAYGROUND.
PRESS THAT SWITCH
BEHIND YOU.
ON--ON THE RIGHT.
THE RIGHT?
THANK YOU.
YOU REALLY OUGHT TO
EXERCISE MORE CONTROL
OVER THEM.
I COULD CHAIN THEM UP,
COULDN'T I?
DON'T YOUR CHILDREN
GO TO SCHOOL?
I HAVE IT NOW. YOU'RE
THE TRUANT OFFICER.
NO, I'M NOT.
DIDN'T YOU EVER
PLAY TRUANT?
I MOST CERTAINLY
DID NOT.
HMM. I'LL BET
YOU DIDN'T.
WHAT IS THIS,
THIS, UM...THING?
A LITTLE INVENTION--
CLEANS CARPETS
BY SUCTION.
ALL THAT
TO CLEAN CARPETS?
AWAY WITH SWEEPING
AND AWAY WITH BRUSHING
AND AWAY
WITH DIRTY CARPETS.
IS THAT ALL YOU DO,
MR. POTTS--INVENT THINGS?
OH, AND WHAT'S
THIS GADGET?
THAT'S NOT
QUITE RIGHT YET,
BUT EVENTUALLY
I HOPE TO TRANSMIT
MOVING PICTURES
BY WIRELESS.
OH, REALLY?
YES, REALLY.
AND THIS?
THIS, MADAM,
IS A SWEET-MAKING MACHINE.
IS THIS ONE
OF THE SWEETS?
YES.
IS IT SUPPOSED
TO HAVE HOLES?
NO, ACTUALLY.
I THINK THE PROBLEM--
YOUR SUGAR'S
BOILING POINT
IS TOO HIGH.
WE'RE AN EXPERT
SWEET-MAKER
AND AN EXPERT
ON CHILD WELFARE?
I WAS TRYING
TO HELP.
MAYBE MY CHILDREN
LIKE RUNNING WILD.
DID THAT EVER
OCCUR TO YOU?
HOW MY CHILDREN BEHAVE
IS NO CONCERN OF YOURS,
SO TAKE YOURSELF OFF
IN YOUR FANCY
AUTOMOBILE
AND GO DO GOOD
SOMEWHERE ELSE.
WELL, I'VE NEVER--
BEEN SPOKEN TO
THAT WAY?
WELL, MAYBE IT'S
ABOUT TIME.
MIND THE CABLE!
VICIOUS, INTERFERING...
IF WOMEN
DRIVE MOTORCARS,
THEY SHOULD LEARN
TO OPERATE ONE.
IT WOULDN'T OCCUR
TO YOU TO HELP.
GET IN THE CAR.
PLEASE.
WELL, FOR
A MECHANICALLY
MINDED MAN--
TRY SWITCHING IT ON.
OH.
HMM!
OPEN THE THROTTLE!
AND KEEP IT OPEN!
WOMEN!
CONFOUNDED WOMAN!
WHO DOES
SHE THINK SHE IS?
DO I NEED
SOMEBODY TO TELL ME
HOW TO RAISE
MY CHILDREN?
DO I? HMM?
NO,
OF COURSE NOT.
OF COURSE NOT!
WHERE'S MY CARDIGAN?
UNDER YOUR JACKET.
UNDER...YES.
SELF-RIGHTEOUS
BUSYBODY.
WELL, SHE WON'T BE
BOTHERING US AGAIN.
BUT I LIKED HER.
SO DID I.
SHE WAS VERY PRETTY.
SHE CERTAINLY WAS.
DO YOU THINK
YOUR FATHER'S A CRACKPOT?
YOUR CARDIGAN'S
INSIDE OUT.
OH.
DO YOU THINK
I'M A LUNATIC,
WASTING MY TIME
ON SILLY INVENTIONS?
THEY AREN'T SILLY.
THEY'RE WONDERFUL.
NOBODY ELSE
COULD THINK OF THEM.
THAT'S RIGHT. NOBODY ELSE
COULD THINK OF THEM.
AFTER ALL, WHAT MAKES
THE BATTLE WORTH THE FIGHTING?
WHAT MAKES THE MOUNTAIN
WORTH THE CLIMB?
WHAT MAKES THE QUESTIONS
WORTH THE ASKING,
THE REASON WORTH THE RHYME?
?? TO ME,
THE ANSWER'S CLEAR ??
?? IT'S HAVING
SOMEONE NEAR ??
?? SOMEONE DEAR ??
?? SOMEONE TO CARE FOR,
TO BE THERE FOR ??
?? I HAVE YOU TWO ??
?? SOMEONE TO DO FOR,
MUDDLE THROUGH FOR ??
?? I HAVE YOU TWO ??
?? SOMEONE TO SHARE
JOY OR DESPAIR WITH ??
?? WHICHEVER BETIDES YOU ??
?? LIFE BECOMES A CHORE ??
??
?? UNLESS YOU'RE LIVING FOR
?? SOMEONE TO TEND TO,
BE A FRIEND TO ??
?? I HAVE YOU TWO ??
?? SOMEONE TO STRIVE FOR,
DO OR DIE FOR ??
?? I HAVE YOU TWO ??
?? COULD BE WE THREE
GET ALONG SO FAMOUSLY ??
?? 'CAUSE YOU TWO
HAVE ME ??
?
?? AND I HAVE YOU TWO, TOO ?
YAY!
OOPS!
AH-CHOO!
?? SOMEONE TO CARE FOR,
TO BE THERE FOR ??
?? I HAVE YOU TWO ??
?? SOMEONE TO DO FOR,
MUDDLE THROUGH FOR ??
?? I HAVE YOU TWO ??
?? SOMEONE TO SMILE
ONCE IN A WHILE WITH ??
?? WHENEVER
YOU'RE LONESOME ??
??
?? I'VE A HAPPY LOT
?? CONSIDERING
WHAT I'VE GOT ??
?? BUT I COULDN'T
DO MORE ??
?? THAN YOU DO FOR
YOUR POOR FATHER ??
DADDY!
DADDY!
?? THINGS GO ASUNDER ??
?? AND I WONDER
WHY YOU BOTHER ??
?? COULD BE WE THREE ??
?? GET ALONG SO FAMOUSLY
'CAUSE ??
?? WE TWO HAVE YOU ??
?? AND I HAVE YOU TWO ??
?? TOO ????
AH!
JEREMY.
OH, GOOD.
DO I SMELL FOOD?
EH?
BRING THE BREAD,
GRANDPA.
YES, SIR!
AND PEPPER
AND SALT, PLEASE.
RIGHT AWAY, SIR!
SAUSAGE AND EGG--
MY FAVORITE!
HOW WAS INDIA?
I SHOT AN ELEPHANT
IN MY PAJAMAS.
HOW HE EVER...
GOT INTO
MY PAJAMAS...
I SHALL
NEVER KNOW.
YOU'VE HEARD IT
BEFORE.
HOW DID
THAT HAPPEN?
COULD WE
ASK YOU SOMETHING?
IT'S ABOUT
MR. COGGINS.
THE JUNKMAN
WANTED IT.
MR. COGGINS
SAYS IF WE ASKED--
HE'S A HORRID
OLD MAN.
MR. COGGINS?
NO. THE JUNKMAN.
HE'S GOING
TO TAKE IT--
AND BURN IT.
IT'S TERRIBLE.
WHAT?
OUR CAR!
YEAH?
THE JUNKMAN'S
BUYING IT.
HE'LL PUT IT
IN THE FIERY FURNACE
AND SKWODGE IT ALL UP
TILL THERE'S
NOTHING LEFT.
OH. WELL,
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
WE CAN'T ALLOW THAT,
GRANDPA.
UH...
UH, NO.
DEFINITELY NOT.
WE KNEW IT.
MR. COGGINS
PROMISED
WE COULD HAVE IT
IF YOU GAVE HIM
UH...30 SHILLINGS.
YOU CAN PAY HIM
IN THE MORNING.
WELL, I SUPPOSE
WE CAN
WORK SOMETHING OUT
SOMEHOW.
YAY!
GOOD!
ARE YOU
ALL FINISHED?
YES, DADDY.
I THINK YOU SHOULD
RUN UP TO BED.
GOOD NIGHT, GRANDPA.
GOOD NIGHT, GRANDPA.
GOOD NIGHT,
DADDY.
GOOD NIGHT, DADDY.
YES, WELL,
YOU'VE DONE IT NOW,
HAVEN'T YOU?
YOU THINK COGGINS
MIGHT DO A DEAL?
COGGINS? SURE.
HE'S SO MEAN HE WOULDN'T
LIGHT YOUR PIPE
IF HIS HOUSE
WAS ON FIRE.
HEAR THAT? YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.
I'LL BE UP ALL NIGHT,
RAIN POURING
THROUGH MY BEDROOM ROOF.
WHY DON'T YOU SLEEP
IN THE WORKSHOP?
YOU PROMISED
TO FIX MY ROOF.
I WILL, GRANDPA.
IT'S JUST--
CARACTACUS, PLEASE,
MY BOY, LISTEN.
AT YOUR AGE,
I DID A DAY'S WORK--
FOR A DAY'S PAY,
POLISHING
THE COLONEL'S BOOTS.
I WAS
THE SMARTEST BATMAN.
WHEN MY BRIGADIER
WENT INTO ACTION,
THE FUZZY-WUZZIES
WERE SO BLINDED
BY HIS BOOTS' SHINE,
THEY COULDN'T SEE
TO FIGHT.
CATCH ME DEATH OF COLD.
HE DON'T CARE.
NOBODY CARES.
ME OWN SON!
SHE WAS RIGHT.
WHO WANTS SWEETS
WITH HOLES IN THEM?
OH, EDISON,
STOP THAT WHISTLING.
EDISON, HEY,
DO THAT AGAIN.
EDISON,
YOU'RE A GENIUS.
THE EMPLOYMENT OFFICE
IS IN THE REAR.
THANK--OH, UH...
I'VE INVENTED
THESE SWEETS.
OH, REALLY.
NAME?
UH, WHISTLING SWEETS.
MR. WHISTLING SWEETS.
I'M NOT
MR. WHISTLING SWEETS.
NO. I'M, UH, POTTS.
MMM.
MAY I SEE
THE MANAGING DIRECTOR?
LORD SCRUMPTIOUS
SEES NO ONE
WITHOUT
AN APPOINTMENT.
HELLO, CHILDREN.
JEREMY, IT'S TRULY.
HELLO, TRULY.
GOOD MORNING,
MISS SCRUMPTIOUS.
GOOD MORNING,
PHILLIPS.
PLEASE TELL FATHER
I'M HERE.
OF COURSE,

ON BUSINESS,
MR. POTTS?
YES, MISS--
UH, FATHER?
TRULY SCRUMPTIOUS.
YOU'RE HIS, UH--
HIS DAUGHTER.
COME ON, CHILDREN.
LET'S GO.
YOU HAVEN'T SHOWN
ANYBODY YOUR INVENTION.
I DON'T THINK
THAT MATTERS.

WHAT WAS IT YOU--
YOU'VE SEEN THEM.
OH, THOSE.

WHISTLE?
THOSE, UH, HOLES.
YOU JUST BLOW
THROUGH THEM.
WHY, THEY'RE

VERY WELL.
PLEASE FOLLOW ME.
MAYBE I
SHOULD COME BACK
IN THREE WEEKS.
GO ON, DADDY.
ALL RIGHT.
AND DON'T LET HIM
BULLY YOU.
YES.
MR. POTTS, MILORD.
POTTS? WHO'S HE?
WHERE'S ME DAUGHTER?
SHE INSISTED
ON HIM SEEING YOU.
ALL RIGHT.
DON'T JUST STAND THERE.
WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?
SWEETS, SIR.
I HARDLY THOUGHT
IT WAS NUTS AND BOLTS.
LET'S HAVE A LOOK.
HURRY UP!
YES, SIR.
IF I MAY EXPLAIN,
SIR.
YOU HAVE EXACTLY
THE FUNDAMENTAL NOVELTY
OF THESE SWEETS
IS THEIR MUSICAL
QUALITY.
NOT ONLY
ARE THEY TASTY,
BUT DUE TO THE UNIQUE
POSITIONING
OF THESE LITTLE HOLES,
THEY ARE CAPABLE,
WHEN BLOWN THROUGH,
OF RENDERING
A TUNEFUL WHISTLE.
PLACE YOUR FINGERS
OVER THE HOLES
AND BLOW THUS.
TASTING TIME, MILORD.
TOO LATE.
HAD YOUR CHANCE.
MUFFED IT.
GOOD MORNING.
FOLLOW HIM.
MILORD?
SIR?
EXCUSE ME.
SIR, IF I MAY
DEMONSTRATE.
BY BLOWING AIR
THROUGH THIS,
YOU GET A WONDERFUL
SOUNDING--
RASPBERRY?
IT'S MORE
LIKE A TOOT.
CARE TO TRY IT?
UNDER
NO CIRCUMSTANCES.
HE'S NOT DOING
VERY WELL, IS HE?
ANOTHER
REMARKABLE FEATURE
ABOUT THESE
LITTLE SWEETS--
THROW IT AWAY!
WILL YOU GET RID
OF THIS IDIOT?
THEY ALSO COME
IN STRAWBERRY, RASPBERRY--
ARE YOU STILL HERE?
AND PINEAPPLE.

IT WASN'T
YOUR FAULT.
IT WAS ALL THOSE

CHILDREN...
ABOUT THE CAR.
YOU SEE,
IS PRETTY HARD
TO COME BY,
AND WHEN I DO
GET ANY MONEY,
I NEED IT
FOR MY INVENTIONS.
THERE ISN'T ANY LEFT.
JEREMY AND I
HAVE BEEN THINKING.
IT'S OUR
TREASURE CHEST.
THESE THINGS ARE
ENORMOUSLY VALUABLE.
LOOK--
AN IVORY TUSK.
THAT MUST BE WORTH
A FORTUNE.
AND DIAMONDS.
AND A GOLDEN
CROWN.
IT'S PROBABLY
KING ALFRED'S.
IT NEEDS
CLEANING UP
A LITTLE.
TAKE THEM, DADDY.
YOU CAN SELL THEM.
AND NEVER MIND
ABOUT THE CAR.
YOU CAN SPEND IT
ALL ON YOUR INVENTIONS.
THANK YOU, CHILDREN.
ALL THESE
WONDERFUL THINGS...
THEY'RE
VERY PRECIOUS.
I'M AFRAID OTHER PEOPLE
WOULDN'T APPRECIATE THEM.
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE
DON'T SEE THINGS
THE WAY YOU DO.
COME ON, NOW.
LET'S GO TO BED.
DON'T YOU WORRY.
THINGS ARE GOING TO

ENGLISH MOTY CAR,
OVER THE CRESTY WAVE
OF THE WATER.
NOT WITHOUT
MY LABORATORY.
OH, I HAVE ALREADY
THOUGHT OF THAT.
HERE IS
YOUR LAVATORY.
HA HA HA HA HA HA.
IF YOU SUCCEED
IN MAKING THE CAR FLOAT,
I WILL MAKE YOU
PRIVY COUNCILOR.
HA HA HA!
BUT IF YOU FAIL,
I WILL STUFF YOUR HEAD

TERRIBLE
TORTURES.

LADS?
NIL DESPERANDUM.
WE'LL SUCCEED.

YOU'RE RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT,

WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH THEM?
HAVEN'T THEY SEEN
CHILDREN BEFORE?
HAVEN'T YOU
NOTICED?
THERE AREN'T
ANY CHILDREN.
NOT ONE.

WHAT'S HAPPENING?
HEY, YOU.

QUICKLY, BEFORE
THE SOLDIERS
GET HERE.

THE SOLDIERS WILL
TAKE THEM AWAY.
WHY? WHAT FOR?
NOBODY'S ALLOWED
TO HAVE CHILDREN
IN VULGARIA.
NOT ALLOWED?
WHAT ABOUT THESE TOYS?
THE BARONESS,
SHE HATES CHILDREN.
WHO COULD
HATE CHILDREN?
DON'T MAKE A SOUND.
SEARCH EVERY HOUSE
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM!
THE FIRST SECTION,
STEP OUT OVER THERE.
THE SECOND, OVER THERE
AND SEARCH. QUICK!
SECTION THREE,

SEARCH EVERYWHERE!
GIDDY-UP!

THAT'S SOMETHING
SPECIAL
FOR THE BARON'S
BIRTHDAY.
LET ME TELL YOU,
TOYMAKER.
THIS NOSE OF MINE
HAS NEVER FAILED ME,
AND IF THERE ARE CHILDREN
HERE, MY FRIEND,
YOU WILL DIE.
HEH HEH HEH HEH.
AHA.

OPEN IT UP!
SEARCH THE CELLAR!
THE BARONESS WILL
HAVE YOUR TEETH
FOR A NECKLACE
AND YOUR EYEBALLS
FOR EARRINGS.
NOBODY.
FOOL! IDIOT!
OUT OF MY WAY!
YOU HAVE TO KNOW
WHERE TO LOOK.
LIKE COCKROACHES,
THEY GET
UNDER THE FLOORS,
IN THE CRACKS IN THE WALLS,
IN THE WOODWORK.
I DON'T TRUST A MAN
WHO MAKES TOYS
IN A LAND WHERE
CHILDREN ARE FORBIDDEN.
EVERY TOY I MAKE
IS EXCLUSIVELY
FOR HIS EXCELLENCY,
THE BARON.
CAPTAIN, WE'VE CAPTURED
THE FLYING CAR!
LET'S GO!
UH-HUH!
TAKE THIS CAR
TO THE CASTLE!
THEY CAN'T
TAKE CHITTY, DADDY.
WHAT WILL YOU DO?
I WON'T
JUST STAND HERE.
ARE YOU GOING TO
TAKE ON
THE WHOLE ARMY
SINGLE-HANDED?
WHAT KIND
OF A COUNTRY
IS THIS?
NO CHILDREN!
EVERYBODY
TERRIFIED.
FRIEND, TAKE
SOME GOOD ADVICE.
TAKE YOUR CHILDREN
AND YOUR GOOD LADY
AND GET OUT
OF VULGARIA.
AND LEAVE GRANDPA
UP IN THE CASTLE?
JUST TELL ME
HOW TO GET THERE.
UNLESS I
FINISH THIS IN TIME
FOR THE BARON'S
BIRTHDAY TOMORROW,
I'LL BE DEAD.
I'LL GO MYSELF.
TRULY, YOU STAY HERE
WITH THE CHILDREN.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE LETTING YOURSELF
IN FOR, BELIEVE ME.
HERE'S ONE FOR YOU,
ONE FOR YOU.
THANK YOU.
KEEP THEM
OUT OF SIGHT.
YOU BE GOOD.
DO WHAT TRULY
TELLS YOU.
YES, DADDY.
WELL,
ARE YOU COMING?
COME.
QUICKLY, QUICKLY,

THERE ISN'T
A SCRAP OF FOOD.
MY TUMMY HURTS.
MINE'S MAKING
FUNNY NOISES.
I MUST FIND
SOMETHING FOR YOU,
IF YOU PROMISE ME
NOT TO MOVE FROM HERE
UNTIL I COME BACK.
WE PROMISE.
REMEMBER,
STAY RIGHT HERE.
TO GET IN THAT WAY,
YOU WOULD
HAVE TO BE A MOUSE
OR A MAGICIAN.
WE SHOULD
GO DOWN NOW
BEFORE A SENTRY
SEES US.
COME.

HE TOOK THE CHILDREN!
YOUR EXCELLENCY!
HELP! HELP!
SILENCE!
CHILDREN,
YOUR HIGHNESS.
FOREIGN CHILDREN.
UNIQUE SPECIMENS.
YOU'RE SURE
THEY CAN'T GET OUT?
HA HA HA!
NO, YOUR HIGHNESS.
PERHAPS YOUR HIGHNESS
WOULD CARE
TO EXAMINE THEM.
NASTY
LITTLE CREATURES.
VERY, VERY
TREACHEROUS.
FOREIGN.
AAH! AAH!
WAIT TILL OUR DADDY
HEARS ABOUT THIS.
HE'LL BLOW UP
THE WHOLE CASTLE!
TAKE THEM AWAY
TO THE TOWER.
TO THE TOWER!
YOU'RE A MEAN OLD LADY.
AND VERY UGLY.
OH!
SHE'S GOING!
SHE'S GOING!
THROUGH THAT SOLID ROCK
IS THE CASTLE
OF BARON BOMBURST.
THESE ARE OUR CHILDREN.
FOR 12 YEARS,
WE HAVE HIDDEN THEM HERE.
THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT A TREE LOOKS LIKE
OR WHAT IT IS TO RUN
OR TO LAUGH.
FOOD!
HERE. THERE'S BREAD
FOR EVERYONE.
LIKE LITTLE RATS,
THEY RUN
UP AND DOWN THE SEWERS,
STEALING FOOD
FROM THE KITCHENS.
HERE, CATCH!
SON! SON!
I THINK MY CHILDREN
ARE IN THE CASTLE
WITH THEIR GRANDFATHER.
HAVE YOU SEEN THEM?
A LITTLE BOY
AND GIRL?
YES.
THEY'RE LOCKED
IN THE TOWER.
AND THE GRANDFATHER?
IN THE DUNGEON.
SIR, HAVE YOU COME
TO HELP US?
ARE YOU GOING TO
TAKE US OUT OF HERE?
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, SON?
PETER, SIR.
WELL, PETER, YOU
SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID,
EVEN IN A TERRIBLE
PLACE LIKE THIS
BECAUSE THERE'S
ALWAYS HOPE.
THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS
TELL MY CHILDREN
WHEN THEY'RE AFRAID.
?? A GENTLE BREEZE ??
?? FROM HUSHABYE MOUNTAIN ??
?? SOFTLY BLOWS
O'ER LULLABY BAY ??
?? IT FILLS THE SAILS
OF BOATS THAT ARE WAITING ??
?? WAITING TO SAIL... ??
?? SO CLOSE YOUR EYES
ON HUSHABYE MOUNTAIN ??
?? WAVE GOODBYE
TO CARES OF THE DAY ??
?? AND WATCH YOUR BOAT
FROM HUSHABYE MOUNTAIN ??
?? SAIL FAR AWAY ??
?? FROM LULLABY BAY ????
IS THAT
YOUR ONLY ADVICE?
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL
DREAM, CARACTACUS,
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT WILL HELP THEM.
WE'RE GOING TO GET UP
INTO THAT CASTLE.
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE!
WE'LL SEE.
EVERYBODY LISTEN TO ME.
YOU WANT TO GET
OUT OF HERE?
YES!
YES!
YES!
TOMORROW IS
BARON BOMBURST'S BIRTHDAY.
BOO!
BOO!
BOO!
WE'LL GIVE HIM
A BIRTHDAY PARTY
HE'LL NEVER FORGET.
GATHER AROUND HERE.

WE MUST ESCAPE
THROUGH THE CELLARS.
VERY WELL. COME ON.
COME ON!
DADDY, LOOK
AT THE CHILDREN.
YAHOO!
YOU STAY HERE.
DADDY!
WHERE ARE THESE CHILDREN
COMING FROM?
WE PASSED A LAW
AGAINST CHILDREN.
THIS WAY.
QUICKLY.
WE'LL GO DOWN HERE.
NO, NO. I'LL GET
MY CLOTHES DIRTY.
DON'T ARGUE.
OH, MY CROWN.
I LOST MY CROWN.
OH, NEVER MIND,
MY LITTLE PUMPKIN.
HERE.
ATTACK!
DADDY!
LOOK! THERE'S CHITTY!
CHITTY'S COME
TO SAVE US! HOORAY!
HELLO--A MOTORCAR.
WHAT'S THAT DOING HERE?
THERE'S GRANDPA.
CARAC--CARACTACUS!
MY BOY!
AAH! AAH! AAH!
OH!
STAND BACK
FROM THE PROPELLERS.
KEEP CLEAR.
BYE!
BYE!
AND SO, AFTER THAT,
VULGARIA BECAME
A FREE COUNTRY,
AND ALL THE CHILDREN
LAUGHED AND PLAYED
IN THE SUNSHINE,
AND THEY WERE
VERY, VERY HAPPY.
AND CHITTY FLEW HIGH
OVER THE MOUNTAINS
BACK TO ENGLAND,
EVERYBODY SAFE AND SOUND.
AND DADDY AND TRULY
WERE MARRIED.
AND LIVED HAPPILY
EVER AFTER.
YES.
IS THAT HOW
THE STORY ENDS?
IT'S GETTING LATE.
WE BETTER GET BACK.
WELL.
GOODBYE, JEREMY.
GOODBYE, JEMIMA.
WILL WE SEE YOU
AGAIN?
OH, I EXPECT SO.
GOODBYE.
GOODBYE.
TRULY.
I HOPE THE CHILDREN
DIDN'T EMBARRASS YOU
BY THAT SILLY JOKE
ABOUT US GETTING MARRIED.
YOU KNOW HOW KIDS ARE.
I DON'T THINK
THEY REALIZE
HOW RIDICULOUS
THAT WOULD BE.
RIDICULOUS?
YOU LIVE
IN THAT BIG HOUSE,
YOUR FATHER,
THE FACTORY AND ALL.
IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD,
TRULY.
IF I SAID THAT,
YOU'D CALL ME
A SNOB.
I DIDN'T MEAN--
GOODBYE.
DON'T YOU WANT
TO RIDE UP FRONT?
THAT WAS
A FINE PICNIC,
WASN'T IT?
SHALL WE HAVE
ANOTHER ONE TOMORROW?
WITH TRULY?
WELL, MISS SCRUMPTIOUS
HAS A LOT
OF SOCIAL ENGAGEMENTS.
ARE WE EVER GOING TO
SEE TRULY AGAIN, DADDY?
WELL, WE'LL SEE.
LOOK, THAT'S
LORD SCRUMPTIOUS' CAR.
I BELIEVE IT IS.
WHAT'S IT
DOING HERE?
I DON'T KNOW.
EXCUSE ME.
GOOD AFTERNOON.
ARE YOU--
BOOM! THAT'S WIPED OUT
YOUR DASHED CAVALRY.
I HAVE MY SECOND
INFANTRY BATTALION
ATTACKING HERE
FROM THE REAR.
ATTACKING FROM THE REAR?
THAT'S DASHED UNETHICAL.
ARTILLERY,
PREPARE TO OPEN FIRE.
FIRE!
NUMBER ONE BATTALION,
PREPARE TO ADVANCE!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
AH, THERE YOU ARE,
YOUNG POTTS.
BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.
AHA! WIPED OUT
YOUR ARTILLERY!
YOU'RE A CAD,
POTTS.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
FANCY YOU BEING
OLD BUNGIE'S SON--
BUNGIE POTTS, BEST
BATMAN I EVER HAD.
YOU WERE--
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE
MY BRIGADIER.
HOW ABOUT
SOME MORE TEA?
YES, SIR.
RIGHT AWAY, SIR.
YOUNG MAN,
THERE'S A CHANCE
YOU'LL BE RICH.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THOSE CONFOUNDED
SWEETS OF YOURS.
USELESS FOR HUMANS,
WONDERFUL FOR DOGS.
WOOF SWEETS
WE'LL CALL THEM.
CANINE CANDIES.
DOGS LOVE THEM.
MAKE A FORTUNE.
YOU'VE DONE IT,
DADDY.
IT'S THE POSH LIFE
FOR US NOW, MY BOY.
WE'LL BE RICH!
HOORAY!
I INVENTED SOMETHING
THAT ACTUALLY WORKS?
I'VE GOT A CONTRACT.
SIGN HERE, PLEASE.
WAIT.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
WHAT ABOUT
THE CONTRACT?
DADDY,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
DADDY!
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HIM?
WELL, HE'S A BIT
OF AN ECCENTRIC, SIR,
A GENIUS,
OF COURSE,
BUT DEFINITELY
AN ECCENTRIC.
CAN'T IMAGINE
WHERE HE GETS IT FROM.
TRULY, YOU'LL NEVER
BELIEVE IT.
YOUR FATHER
WAS AT MY HOUSE.
THEY TOLD ME
AT THE HOUSE.
WE'RE RICH.
OH!
YOU KNOW,
MORE THAN THAT,
I HAVE SUCCEEDED.
I ALWAYS KNEW
YOU WOULD.
YOU KNOW
SOMETHING ELSE?
THE KIDS WERE RIGHT.
THERE'S NOTHING
RIDICULOUS ABOUT
GETTING MARRIED.
WHOEVER SAID
THERE WAS?
WELL, MR. POTTS.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
NOW YOU'LL HAVE TO
MARRY ME.
SO DREAMS
CAN COME TRUE.
YES, THEY CAN,
BUT YOU HAVE TO
BE PRACTICAL, TOO.
YOU HAVE TO FACE FACTS.
MEN SHOULD SEE THINGS
AS THEY REALLY ARE.
A MAN
WITH RESPONSIBILITIES
CAN'T HAVE HIS HEAD
IN THE CLOUDS.
A MAN SHOULD KEEP
HIS FEET ON THE GROUND.
A MAN SHOULD
HAVE HIS DREAMS
BUT LEARN TO PUT THEM
TO PRACTICAL USE,
NOT JUST SIT AROUND
AND THINK ABOUT THEM
ALL THE TIME.
