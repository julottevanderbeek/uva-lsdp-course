Christmas.
tmas.
My husband and I took the kids
out to buy a Christmas tree
-
-
Thank you and Merry
Christmas to you.
The wait almost over.
Its just hours away.
I didn't know Rolex
had three X’s.
I also got pen and
stationary real cheap.
The office supplies were my
severance package when I eh...
Left to pursue other
opportunities.
I'm a victim of oppressive
corporate bureaucracy.
I was a hard working
entrepreneur.
Smuggling in junk food,
dirty magazines.
An actual stool
pigeon ratted me out.

Are you selling counterfeit
watches again?
Second, I was giving them as a Christmas
gift to my dear old friend Olive.
Hum, I'm watching you penguin.
Don't forget it.
Thanks for helping
me out there Olive.
Where were you Olive, it's late.
How are your dog chores coming,
did you bury any bones today?
Chase any cars or cats?
Did you even make a token attempt
to tear up any flower beds.
And I haven't heard any
senseless barking at all.
I don't know how you can
call yourself a dog Olive?
Come on Tim, you know I'm
not for that silly stuff.
I've tried to be mans best friend
by being your best friend.
Y-yeah well get with the program
Olive and start acting like a dog.
There's no Christmas this year.
He's known for years that
your not like other dogs.
He even teases you for
having a pet flea.
Why's he so upset
all of a sudden?
Ever since he was tiny,
Tim has loved Christmas
but he thinks theirs no
Christmas this year.
Are you still gonna
give him the slippers?
Yeah, I probably should
chew them first.
Ah, what I wouldn't give
for opposable thumbs.

High pitch sound

≡⚡ Tonight on fox, the world's
wildest mistletoe accidents.
≡⚡ Recapping our top story,
≡⚡ Santa is expected to cancel his
traditional Christmas Eve flight.
≡⚡ Blitzen the reindeer was
injured earlier today
≡⚡ during a practice flight
and won't recover in time.
≡⚡ Santa had this to say.
≡⚡ Ho, ho, ho. I'm not sure
if I'll have to cancel,
≡⚡
≡⚡ Maybe somehow,
we'll make do with

≡⚡
Did Santa just say "Olive
the other reindeer?"
He said, "Maybe we'll make do
with all of the other reindeer,"
No! He said "Olive the other
reindeer." I heard him.
Santa needs you to be the
replacement reindeer.
That's why you're not interested in
chasing cars and barking like an idiot.
That would explain a lot, but
I just don't think so, Fido.
I'll bet Tim would rather
have you pull Santa's sleigh
than chase flower beds and
tear up cars, or whatever.
-
-
You've got to get
to the North Pole.
-
- Olive!
I really don't want to
get yelled at again.
Olive? I came to apologize.
I think he said, "I'm
ashamed of all your lies."
You didn't do anything wrong.
Santa's not flying, and
I took it out on you.
"You always do everything wrong,
Santa's not flying and I shou.."
we can still have Christmas
come on in the house. I'm
lighting the yule log,
and there's a space for you.
"You can't kill my Christmas.
Get out of this house.
I'm getting a new dog,
and I'm replacing you."
Olive? Are you there?
Olive!
Tim's getting a new dog.
He's replacing me.
I wouldn't believe it if I
hadn't heard it myself.
I've got to get to the north
pole and pull that sleigh.
Tim seems to blame me for
Santa not flying, but
maybe I can still be his dog if I
can be Santa's other reindeer.
Now you're talking. Olive
the other reindeer!
-
-
Could you finish
wrapping these presents?
-
-
Oh, that's ok, Olive.
No harm done.
Aren't you going to kick me
or spray me or something?
Wow, I guess you really
got the Christmas spirit.
That's right. The "no
more Christmas" spirit.
Did you hear? Santa's not flying.
He's through.
At last. We're breaking
the cycle of despair.
By next year, people will have
forgotten about Christmas.
What's the matter
with Christmas?

Hate to disappoint you, but I'm going to
the North Pole to save Santa's flight.
You're not a reindeer.
You can't fly.
I'll be zooming right over your
head, pulling that sleigh.
And it will be a Merry Christmas
even for you, if you let it.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a bus to catch.
Nobody's going to help
that lousy old Santa.
Stay away from the North Pole,
or I'll hand cancel you!
I need a ticket to
the North Pole.
Bus N-34 connects at Arctic
Junction boarding right now.
Hi, old buddy. Can you
pay for my ticket?
No, Martini. Why don't you go
pursue other opportunities?
Come on. I'll pay
you back later.
It's Christmas. There's
no room at the inn.
This is absolutely the
last time I help you out.
-
-
This dog committed mail fraud.
I'm taking her into custody.
She's wanted for several
counts of mail fraud,
including, uh, licking
self-adhesive stamps and
not mailing early
for the holidays.
Last call for bus N-34,
service to the North Pole.
You owe me for those pens.
Come on!
So how come you're going
to the North Pole?
Blitzen's hurt, so they need another
reindeer, or they can't fly.
I heard Santa on the radio saying that
he needed Olive, the other reindeer.
but Santa said, "All
of the other reindeer".
I'm afraid you just
misunderstood.
I used to think the
pledge of allegiance
So you think Santa asked
you to pull his sleigh.
I almost hate to point
out that you're a dog.
I've always been different
than other dogs,
and somebody has got
to do something,
or it won't be a very
Merry Christmas.
And why are you going to
the North Pole, Martini?
Well, I figure if
Christmas is canceled,
maybe I can pick
up all of Santa's
toys cheap and make
a bundle on them.
Hey, are you going
to the North Pole?
Oh, the North Pole
metropolitan area.
40 degree temperatures
were fun for a while, but,
whew! It will be
nice to get home.
And they have hooves
instead of paws,
and their fur is much
thicker than yours.
Listen, uh, Olive,
I'm from a zoo.
I know reindeer. I
worked with reindeer.
and however it is
that they can fly,
Years of practice
plus jet packs.
I know you're all
trying to be helpful,
you just suddenly know
exactly what to do.
Yeah, like the time
I suddenly had no
brakes going down
the mountain road.
but I guess it must have
turned out all right.
Maybe we should have
taken the train.
You! You can run,
but you can't hide!
He's desperate to
wreck Christmas,
Richard, how long till we
reach Arctic Junction?
Olive! Where, oh,
where can she be?
Oh, I was too hard on her.
Now I really ruined Christmas.
This goes under there.
Get in there tighter.
I wonder how she's doing.
So I pointed out to the
judge that technically,
it wasn't a pyramid
scheme because I had...
Arctic Junction!
Arctic Junction!
We've got time to grab
some food, if you want.
-
-
The bone. Dressing
on the side, please.
I'll try the deep-fried
candy canes.
Maybe I should have tried
the reindeer chow.
≡⚡ Here's the latest
from the North Pole.
≡⚡ Santa claus has scheduled a press
conference for 11 o'clock tonight.
≡⚡ He is expected to cancel his
flight for the first time ever.
-
-
I'm Olive, and I'm going to
the North Pole to help Santa.
You're Olive, the
other reindeer?
Santa's looking for you.
He's out in the parking lot.
He wants to give
you a flying test.
But I'll let him know
you failed the test!
Neither rain nor snow et cetera
will keep me from keeping you
from the North Pole
and saving Christmas!
It's beginning to look
nothing like Christmas
I hate you and I hope you
never come again. Stay home.
Postal regulations require you
to stay put and keep quiet.
It was the postman, wasn't it?
We found the waitress' clothes.
Have you ever heard
of Deus ex machina?
-
-
You should have
gone on without me.
I just called the postal service
to complain about that postman.
Guess what? I got
their voice mail.
How can we get to
the North Pole now?
but if I don't get back
to the depot in time,
We'll try it. Thanks,
Richard, for everything.
I'm rooting for you,
Olive, you other reindeer.
I'm Santa's
replacement reindeer.
I need a ride to the
North Pole so I can
help pull the sleigh
and save Christmas.
You don't look like no
reindeer to me, mutt.
Like the kind of birds
that fly, I mean.
It's a miracle, we found
another flying reindeer,
-
-
Hey, let's take her up to the
roof and see how she flies.
Ah, that's enough fellas. Ah.
We'll just leave now.
Watch it, pal. That's
valuable merchandise.
A barking reindeer,
isn't that just...
Maybe I'm just a little
runt with no antlers,
but it looks like I'm the only one
who's trying to save Christmas.
There are actually people out there
who want to cancel Christmas.
Is that how you want
to remember Christmas?
You must have asked
Santa for something.
Do you think you deserve
what you've asked for?
Santa doesn't just give you
stuff because you ask.
I'm trying to deserve
the good things I have
and the good things I hope
I will have in the future.
If you want me to fail, then I guess
it's to late to save Christmas
-
-
I asked Santa for a reversible, 3
speed, cordless, electric drill.
I'm too naughty to deserve
such a nice drill.
All right, pull
yourself together.
I'm sorry, Olive. We're
really not such a bad bunch.

Oh, like in the
silent night song.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Anyway, Round John can take you
as far as the North Pole gates.
And I'm sorry I was
such a jerk earlier.
You're not the only
one who's let their
emotions get the
better of them, today.
Here, high-quality
office supplies for ya'.
Anonymous high-ranking elves
are confirming that
Santa will shortly make
a statement, officially canceling his
traditional Christmas Eve flight.
Your reaction, little dogie?
My client has no
comment at this time.
but you even got me believing
this is gonna work.
I'm here to help
pull Santa's sleigh.
But Santa said on the
radio that he was
counting on Olive,
the other reindeer.
Isn't there someone
who I could talk...
Now move along, or I'll
have you arrested.
And I'm warning you, the fence
is protected by alarms.
So just go back where
you came from.
Time to think of plan B.
Humm...
While you're thinking, maybe
I'll just go use that pay phone.

You know, this could

carburetor or a
decaffeinated dodecahedron.
I'll just have to
recalibrate the ah, time.
I'll need you to kill the alarms along
the fence for a minute, though.
Well, otherwise the
electromagnetic wave will
interfere with the signals
from the satellite.
It just needs the
complimentary engraving.
I'll tell you what, I'll have
it back for you on Monday.
And I'm sorry for
the inconvenience.
More children's
letters to Santa!
Let's do the press conference, boss,
and hope for better luck next year.
There must be some
way you could go.
I doubt we could
handle it, chief.
So many of the kids' letters this
year haven't been very nice.

Maybe it's time to

Santa, I know who's been
writing those letters.
They're all from a
very mean postman
Well, look at the envelopes.
No postmarks.
And just who might you
be, little dogie?
I'm Olive, the replacement
reindeer you asked for.
I'm not quite
following you, Olive.
We always get the crazies on
Christmas Eve. Never fails.
Well, now, if you're sure all those
mean letters aren't from real kids...
And all over the world,
everyone is hoping you'll
fly tonight and make
their dreams come true.
but give me a try for all those good folks
who deserve what they've asked for.
I guess they'll understand
if you can't make it,
but Round John Virgin sure would
like that electric drill.
but mostly I think he
just wants Christmas.
I don't think he'll find
a better dog, Olive,
-

-
-
Comet, help Olive
here get hitched up.
I've just learned you'd
better not pout,
you'd better not cry,
you'd better not shout,
I'm telling you why.
A mysterious other reindeer has
arrived to take blitzen's place.
As of now, the
flight is on again.
I'll be darned, she
really did it.
Who's she? What's going on?
≡⚡ Oh, she had a clear
sense of mission.
≡⚡
≡⚡ Close, close friend
of mine for years.
≡⚡ Not not housebroken.
Not to my knowledge.
There's no Rudolph. It's just
one of those urban legends.
Ready! Olive, the
other reindeer, huh?
Well, why not? It's a
season of miracles.
≡⚡ Santa one niner niner niner
cleared for takeoff on 22 left.
Merry Christmas! Et
cetera, et cetera.
Unorthodox style, but, hey,
whatever works for you.
You had me worried for a
minute there, though.
I think so. Just don't
pick up any hitchhikers.
'Cause this year, even
though I've been naughty,
The laws of breaking and entering, as
they pertain to Santa, are unclear.
And, look, I got
another present!
I must've been extra
bad this year.
Doll, Jack-in-the-box, eh...
Cordless drill.
The train set that should have
been mine when I was a kid.
That was the year Santa started
putting me on his naughty list.
So I'm not cutting
him any slack!
We're only at the first
house, and I'm beat.
You want some lichen-flavored gum?
It'll perk you up.
Bad news, gang. Somehow
we got the wrong sack.
Just head north. Sooner or
later, I'll pick up the scent.
Get off me, you
jolly old busybody!
Never! You should
have stayed home!
Was that you or
your stunt double?
I'd offer you a lift in the sleigh,
but comet says no hitchhikers.
Just our luck that
you're flightless.
Hey, don't worry about me.
I'll drive home.
Plus, someone's gotta
take care of Mr. zip.
Thanks for everything, Martini.
What will you do now?
Eh, you know, I'll do a little
loan-sharking, sell a little Amway.
Olive, great job
getting the toys back.
Any chance we could
go faster, gang?

I guess I could
deliver this stuff.
It's not as glamorous
as helping Santa.
But, there'll be trouble if the
folks can't enter their sweepstakes.
And three cheers for
Olive, the other reindeer.
-
-
After we get home and
relax for a while,
we usually go out for
some reindeer games.
Olive, I'm sorry, but we're lost in
the fog. Could you smell us home?
Yea.
Olive I'd be honored if you'd
call me comet the other dog.
Well, I gotta hand it to you,
Olive, you saved Christmas.
No, I only convinced everyone
else to do their best.
Oh, don't you be
so modest, Olive!
Presents for the
staff and crew!
Uh, boss, from an
insurance point of view,
the jump ropes, probably
not a wise idea.
Olive, here's
something for you.
I know I'm not really a reindeer,
but I'm proud I could help anyway.
I'd love to stay, but
I really must go home.
I thought so. Let me finish my
cappuccino, and I'll give you a lift.
- Bye Olive.
-
-
-
Martini, you helped
save Christmas!
Oh, well, I hope
it was a color set.
Black and white
doesn't do me justice.
I'm pleased to offer you your
old position back, Martini.
The zoo can always find
room for an extraordinary
flightless aquatic bird who
attracts media attention.
And we've been a little short-handed
since the monkeys escaped.
I think I can get you
an even better penguin.
Hum...
Olive the other saves Christmas.
Huh?
I hope you're not
too mad at me.
Olive!
I was so worried you'd
never come back!
I'm sorry I was so mean.
Can you ever forgive me?
I was so upset about Santa
that I forgot that I had the
best dog in the whole world.
Wow! And the best
reindeer, too!
Merry Christmas, Olive!
Good girl! Good girl!
Aw, you're the best!
