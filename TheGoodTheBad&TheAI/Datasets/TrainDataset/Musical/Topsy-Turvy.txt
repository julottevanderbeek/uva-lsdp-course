One, two. Two, two.

-
-  Sir Arthur, what are you doing?
- I'm going to the theater, Louis.
- No. It is not possibIe.
- I have no choice.
- You must get back --
- Louis!
- Hot coffee. Very strong, please.
- D'accord.
- Louis.
- Don't move.
- Schnell!
- PIease.
Clothilde, encore du cafe. Vite.
- Sir Arthur, la tasse, s'il vous plait.
- D'accord.
- Bonne chance, Sir Arthur.
- Merci.
Louis --
I'II be fine. Now go and fetch the cab.
- Manton.
- Good evening, sir.
-  Arthur!
- Good God, Arthur. Is this entirely wise?
- No, it's entireIy fooIish, Frank.
- Do you intend to go on?
I certainIy do, HeIen.
I've never missed one yet.
- Very weIl. I'Il Iet everybody know.
- Here. Take a drink.
Thank you.
- Oh, that's better, Frank. Thank you.
- Your gIoves, sir.
Very good, Louis.
This is a surprise, sir.
- Permission, Mr. Cook?
- Permission, Shrimp.
-  Come.
- Four minutes, Mr. Grossmith.
-
-
-
- Monsieur.
Bonsoir.
You're going to have a definite success, sir.
- Merci.
- Au revoir.
What do you expect me to do,
kiss the carpenters?
Arthur!
Get him up. Please, sir.
- Let's get him up. Come on, Sir Arthur.
-
Arthur, take some brandy.
- What happened? What happened?
- One moment. He wilI be fine.
-
- ls Dr. Lynch in the house?
Listen to this. Today's Times.
"Princess Ida wilI probabIy run for a year...
keeping the Savoy treasury
agreeabIy repIete aIl the whiIe.
AII London will fIock to hear it.
So wiIl our provincial and American cousins
and ContinentaI visitors.
Copies of its words and music
wiII be sold by tens of thousands.
Everybody connected
with its performance...
wilI have a good time
for at Ieast a tweIvemonth to come.
So mote it be."
How spIendid, WilIie.
Sugared words, Lucy.
Listen.
"The opera is above the IeveI
of alI other entertainments...
before the London pubIic.
StiIl, I cannot pronounce it
to be in any way...
an improvement upon its predecessors.
To me, words and music aIike
reveal symptoms of fatigue...
in their respective composer and author.
Arthur SuIIivan cannot write
other than in pIeasing manner...
but more than one number
in Princess lda...
is lacking in the freshness and spontaneity...
of The Pirates of Penzance,
Patience, lolanthe...
or The Sorcerer, his best operatic work."
Oh? Is it?
"Or H.M.S. Pinafore, the most popular.
W.S. GiIbert abundantIy proves
he is stiII the legitimate monarch...
of the realm of topsy-turvydom."
Thank you very much.
"But his incongruities are more
elaborately worked up than of yore...
and therefore less funny.
Moreover, the story is a duIl one."
- Burn it, Pidgeon!
- Sir.
WiIIie!
Your kidneys are getting coId!
The show's doing splendidIy, Arthur.
FuIl houses and a healthy advance.
CapitaI.
Three tours on the road --
Pirates, Patience and lolanthe.
- And four in rehearsaI.
- Merveilleux.
-  New York can't wait for Ida.
- Ah, New York. How splendid.
- HeIen has us booked up to the end of the year.
-  TireIess as ever.
AII part of my day's work.
- Tea, Miss Lenoir?
- No, thank you, Louis.
Very weII.
I do hope your confinement
hasn't made you restless, Arthur.
How have you been passing the time?
I've made some resolutions, HeIen.
- A littIe late in the New Year, perhaps, but --
- Better late than never.
May we know what they are, Arthur?
Why not?
One:
To travel to the Continent,
as soon as my heaIth permits.
- Very wise.
- I think so.
Two: To Iook for a country house
where l may repair each summer...
without having to cross the channeI.
- Three: To take more exercise.
- ExceIIent, Arthur. And about time too.
A Ieaf out of your book, D'Oyly.
l must waIk more.
And is there a number four?
Yes.
To write no more operas for the Savoy.
- And what is number five?
- To fIy to the moon with his bed socks on.
No, I'm serious.
I have to write a grand opera.
PeopIe expect it of me.
I must not disappoint them.
I cannot waste any more time
on these trivial souffIes.
Do you know l haven't written
a symphony for over 20 years?
Not an unprofitabIe 20 years,
if l may say so.
Arthur, if you wouId only learn to
organize your time more efficiently...
you couId do everything you wished.
My time is finite, HeIen. l must filI it
with that which is important to me.
Is not the Savoy Theatre important to you?
This work with GiIbert
is quite simpIy kiIling me.
Working with Gilbert would kilI anybody.
Is your contract with D'Oyly
and Mr. Gilbert not important to you?
But our present concern is your heaIth.
You must go to the south of France
and recover.
We can discuss this on your return.
I shalI recover, D'Oyly.
And I shall return.
But there will be nothing to discuss.
- Did you dine at the Beefsteak CIub?
- Yes.
Somewhat unsatisfactory.
Oh.
WeII, you missed Mrs. Judd's rabbit curry.
One gets the impression that everyone
is snickering behind one's back.
Perhaps you could have some
for tomorrow's lunch.
"The king of topsy-turvydom."
Humiliating.
You Iook a IittIe uncomfortabIe.
I'm comfortable enough.
- l watched a bit from the wings.
- Oh, did you?
First act. Seemed to be going
rather weII, surprisingIy.
There. You see?
- Would you like me to read to you?
- No, thank you.
I'II leave you. You must be tired.
- No, I'm not in the slightest.
- lt's wrong of me to unburden myself on you.
Don't be silly. That's why l'm here.
Come and taIk to your Kitty.
Sometimes one wonders why one bothers.
They say jump, you jump.
- Good night, my dear.
- Good night.
Lady CoIin is endeavoring
to persuade us to take up smoking.
She's writing an articIe
for The Saturday Review.
She proposes that nicotine
is a gift from the gods...
and if men may benefit
from its soothing quaIities...
why then may women not also?
My poor daughter now believes
that smoking is an extension...
of the communion
between a woman and her husband.
WiIl she be smoking a cigarette
on her wedding day?
Heaven forfend.
-
- Lady CoIin is irresistibIe.
She cannot conceive
why the Irish are starving...
when there's lots of good fish in the sea.
She most probably has a point.
- Oh, there's good news from DubIin.
- Hmm?
The ChurchiIls are to return to London.
Forgiven but not forgotten.
I do hope so.
Jenny says Winston is 1 1 ...
covered in freckles
and has a total disdain for authority.
Mmm.
I shalI miss this fragrance.
SiciIian lemons.
Have you chosen your Beethoven
for the PhiIharmonic Society?
As a matter of fact, I have. Yes.
- No. 2?
- The seventh.
- Ah.
- More dramatic.
And that is to be your work
whiIst you're away?
That... and only that.
WiIl there be room for Mr. Gilbert
in your baggage?
CertainIy not. He's far too large.
Food for thought.
It's not for me to say.
Indeed not.
Which train wilI you catch?
The tidaI train.
Up at 7:00.
Arriving in Paris at 3:30?
More or Iess.
How wiII you spend your first night of liberty?
I shaIl take some exercise.
Hmm.
- Oh!
-  Ah!
Ooh, ooh!
-
- Whoo!
-
-
Whoo!
- Oh, yah!
- Ah!
Whoo!
-
-
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
What's your name?
This is Miss Cheese, monsieur.
Yes, it's true.
Mademoiselle Fromage.
What kind of cheese?
Swiss cheese, perhaps?
Yes, yes!
With little holes?
-
-
Oh!
My voice. My voice.
I've... strained my voice.
I've been trying too hard.
The smalIer the house,
the greater the effort.
I'm very cross with myseIf.
I shouId know better.
One's knocking one's pipes out...
in a vain attempt to elicit a response
from three coloniaI bishops...
two eIderIy Iadies
and an intoxicated costermonger.
They're aII roasting in their own lard
like the Christmas goose.
Yes, and the costermonger
Iaughed at the intervaI.
- Did he?
- Mmm.
Ha! A man of infinite taste. Clearly.
WiIl you take a wee gargIe
of my salt water, Dickie?
Oh, no, thank you, dear chap.
It wouId put me in mind of my boyhood.
- Mmm. Do forgive me.
- Not at all.
- l fear that dear Mr. GiIbert has run out of ideas.
- No.
He doesn't know what to do with me.
Ponder this.
He thrusts me into a gamut
of tight-fitting pots, pans and pails...
and poaches me Iike a fucking haddock.
Forgive my AngIo-Saxon, Mr. Butt.
Do have a biscuit.
Oh, thank you, sir.
I'II take one home with me for me supper.
Dickie, it's just this heat.
lt addIes the noodles.
It happened to me in MiIan frequently.
Ah. Milano. Bellissimo.
The heat Iess heIIish.
l am humiIiated.
One might as welI be in the chorus.
Away with you, you wee monkey.
AIas, no. The reign of the emperor Gilbert
is aIl but at an end.
- l consider this to be his best piece so far.
- With alI due respect, my dear Durward...
your romantic opinion
may be informed by the fact...
that you take a rather good role
in which, of course, you are tres splendide.
- Grazie.
- Prego.
But I consider Princess Ida to be their worst.
- Do you?
- I do.
Where is the panache of Pirates?
The wit of the Pinafore?
"From such a face and form as mine...
the noblest sentiments...
sound Iike the bIack utterances
of a depraved imagination."
- lt was very good, you know.
- Yes, Dickie.
Do forgive me, dear boy.
I don't wish to be the prophet of doom...
but one cannot help
but have the distinct feeIing...
that the sword of Damocles
hovers ominousIy over the Savoy Theatre.
- How was TempIe?
- Oh.
Rather disgruntIed, l fear.
As though he wasn't
quite enjoying himseIf.
- His heart wasn't in it.
- No.
- One can usuaIly reIy on Mr. TempIe, can't one?
- Mmm.
And the Iadies' chorus Iook as though
they couId alI do with a hearty meaI.
It's this infernal heat.
One stiII has to feed oneself, WilIie,
whatever the weather.
Mmm.
And the audience were fanning themseIves
with their programs and Iibretti.
Most distracting, when one is striving
to concentrate on the performance...
to have in the corner of one's eye
this confounded fIapping.
Makes one want to stand up and shout.
- l trust you restrained yourseIf.
- Yes, of course l did, WilIie.
- More tea, ma'am?
- No, thank you, Pidgeon.
- Coffee, sir?
- Yes. Pidgeon?
- Sir?
- Did my father say anything else?
Nothing I should care to repeat, sir.
There were more peopIe
on the stage than in the audience.
Did you count them?
- No, of course l didn't, WilIie.
- Then how do you know?
- l was speaking metaphoricaIly.
- You were exaggerating.
- Anything eIse, sir?
- No, thank you.
Ma'am.
"O horror...
horror...
horror!"
WilIie.
-
- Come in.
- Good morning, my dear.
- Good morning, Richard.
- Another scorcher?
- The everIasting bonfire.
- Good morning, governor.
- Morning, Barker.
Thank you.
- Shocking.
- Most alarming.
A mediocre evening.
- Three fainters.
- ln the audience?
I fear so. AlI women.
- Any absentees?
- Four chorus members.
- With doctor's notes?
- Yes. Thank you.
And... how are the returns?
- Oh, good grief.
- lt's an improvement on Monday.
Seven dead horses
in the Strand this morning.
WeII, one down by Trafalgar Square.
I don't know how you can sit there
in your hat and coat, Barker.
I'm too hot to remove them, Mr. Carte.
- This is deveIoping into something of a crisis.
-  lndeed it is.
A man has a wife and chiIdren to support.
I fear we shall aII have to pray for rain.
WeIl, if it's any consolation,
every theater in town is afflicted.
Even the Gaiety, graced as it is with
Madame Bernhardt's execrable Lady Macbeth.
- Thirty-eight percent.
- Who toId you that, Barker?
HoIlingshead.
I-l pIayed a game of cricket with him...
this morning before breakfast
at Coram's FieIds.
- ln this heat?
- Yes, madam, but not in this attire.
- Oh, good.
- Mr. HoIlingshead has toId you a fib, Barker.
- lndeed?
- He's only playing to 29%.
Mr. HoIlingshead has no need
to lie to me, Mr. Carte.
Mr. HoIlingshead has much need
to Iie to everybody, Mr. Barker.
- EspecialIy you.
- Gentlemen.
Are you there?
Yes.
- HelIo?
- ls that you, Mr. Gilbert?
- HelIo?
- HelIo?
- Good morning, Barker.
- This is Barker speaking.
- GiIbert here!
- Good morning, Mr. Gilbert.
How are we today, Barker?
Are we popuIar, or are we mad?
Ah. Uh, we are popular!
Very good. Carry on.
Here is your message for today:
"U," "U," plus 1 0 shilIings and sixpence.
- Can you repeat that, please?
- Yes.
"U," "U."
- So, that's "U" for "udder" --
- Yes.
- "U" for "udder" --
- Yes
- pIus ten shilIings and sixpence.
- Yes
So, you have two udders, Barker?
- Uh, yes.
- l aIways suspected as much.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Mr. Gilbert.
I'm going to hang up the teIephone now.
I-lndeed you are, sir.
WeII, l'm, uh, going out
to seek a IittIe ltalian hokeypokey...
and I care not who knows it.
Thank you, Barker.
I shaIl not return with any for you, sir,
because it would melt.
Au revoir.
I owe you an apoIogy, Kitty. It would appear
you weren't exaggerating after aIl.
ApoIogy accepted. Thank you, WilIie.
Schwenck speaks to the Savoy
every morning in code, father-in-Iaw...
just in case the telephone operator
should be eavesdropping.
One might as welI open the window
and shout down the street.
There. That shouId be
more comfortabIe for you.
Sheer waste of time.
It wiII only resuIt in the further erosion
of the written word.
- WouId you care to sit down now?
-
Thank you.
- Ah, there you are, Pidgeon.
- Ma'am.
l do apoIogize, sir,
that neither I nor Schwenck...
was here to weIcome you
on your arrivaI last night.
I do not appreciate being
left upon the doorstep like a hawker.
lf you'II only take the troubIe
to press the eIectric beIl, Father...
you'lI be admitted at once.
- ls that not so, Pidgeon?
- lndeed it is, sir.
I have no intention of pIacing
my life in danger, sir.
How many doorstep deaths
have we had thus far, Pidgeon?
None to my certain knowledge, sir.
There you are, Father.
The odds would appear to be in your favor.
- WiIl there be anything eIse, sir?
- No, thank you.
Would you telI Mrs. Judd
that Dr. GiIbert wilI be joining us for lunch?
Certainly, ma'am.
You know, father-in-law, that you are
most welcome in our home at any time...
but pIease do try to inform us
of your intention to visit.
A father shouId not have to seek permission
to visit his own son.
The son shouldn't be expected
to be cIairvoyant.
Who does he think l am? HarIequin?
WouId you excuse me?
I take it that you wiII be joining us
for Iunch, father-in-law?
I-l have no idea...
where I shalI be
taking Iuncheon, thank you.
WeII, perhaps Schwenck can persuade you.
Take lunch with us, Father.
We shaII enjoy your company.
Have I to understand, sir, that you have
been in communication with your mother?
No, Father, not for some considerable time,
l'm glad to say.
You are a liar, sir.
No, sir.
I can assure you, Papa,
that the very Iast person...
with whom I wish to have
any communication at aII...
is your estranged wife...
the vicious woman who bore me
into this ridicuIous world.
How dare you, sir. Have you no respect?
Don't misunderstand me, Father.
Nobody respects her more than I do...
and I can't stand the woman.
- She is a veritable gorgon!
- She is indeed.
And she has chosen her own path.
And in so doing, she has turned
her back on yourseIf and myseIf.
And for that smaIl mercy,
we shouId both of us be eternally gratefuI.
Those terrors...
that visit me in the night.
- They can never be vanquished.
- Ah!
Insomnia. I suffer from it myseIf.
But it is she who sends them.
I know it is she.
I know not
what heathen oracle she consults...
what fiIthy familiar she empIoys.
I know that they wiIl come.
Wh-Wh-What are these waIls?
No!
- $5,000?
- The Iast 1 0 shares. Worth every penny.
Trust me, Arthur.
I do, D'Oyly.
- What's this?
- PulI it.
- Oh.
- lt's a reservoir pen. It contains its own ink.
Good gracious me.
- What ever wilI they think of next?
- Try it.
Now, how long is aII this going to take?
Two years.
I shall begin the foundations next month.
- Thank you.
-
- To the Savoy HoteI.
- The Savoy HoteI.
With its 70 bathrooms.
The builder was much bemused.
"What's the point
of 'aving a bathroom to every bedroom?
Who's goin' to be staying there --
amphibians?"
D'OyIy, l can't teIl you how delightfuI
it is to see you here in Paris.
- You're looking much better.
- A new man.
Monte CarIo was most profitabIe.
FIorence was hideously hot.
I sampled the Chartreuse at Certosa.
The monks were uncommonly charming.
The train journey through
the Saint Gotthard Pass is spectacular.
You must go.
And Lucerne -- tranquilIity itseIf.
I waIked untiI I dropped.
Did you receive my letter?
- Yes, l did.
- Good.
And?
It came to Brussels.
- l sent it to BrusseIs, Arthur.
- Yes, of course.
We're ready.
You kiIled the pigeon yourseIf?
No, sir. l Ieave that to the executioner.
It's the best way.
Monsieur.
So, what is your position?
Much the same, l'm afraid.
I fulIy realize, D'OyIy,
that you have me under contract.
But l cannot write
any more operas for the Savoy.
At Ieast not of that particuIar character.
I think you shouId teIl Gilbert.
I shaIl. The moment l return.
Gentlemen, enjoy your meaI.
- Merci.
- Merci.
-
-
- Oh!
-
- ll est bien, Clothilde.
- Oui madame. You are a tonic for him.
Merci. Cherish him.
Of course, madame.
-
- Ah! Mrs. Ronalds, what an unexpected pIeasure.
- Mr. GiIbert, how are you?
- How are you?
- Quite welI, thank you.
- I'm so pleased.
- He's in excelIent spirits.
- ls he? l Iook forward to hearing his tales.
- Good day.
- Good day to you.
- Au revoir.
- Madame.
- Ca va, Clothilde?
- Ca va, monsieur.
- lt is hot, no?
- Yes.
- He awaits.
- Thank you.
How was your crossing, SuIIivan?
MercifuIIy smooth, thank you.
- As smooth as D'Oyly Carte.
-
No, not quite, Gilbert.
- Lump sugar?
- Thank you, no.
Oh, pIease do.
I found it in Lucerne. lt's delicious.
If you insist.
- Mmm.
- Very good. Mmm.
- Is Lucy welI?
- Oh, she's in fine fettIe.
She sends you her Iove
and trusts you are in good heaIth.
Thank you. PIease reciprocate.
Of course.
- What's this Carte's been teIling me?
- Oh, dear.
- You can't be serious.
- l'm afraid l am.
So you've torn up
our contract into tiny pieces...
and cast it to the four winds.
Don't be absurd.
- WeII, that would be the impIication.
- l hardIy think so.
What eIse is one to deduce?
Oh, Gilbert.
There's so much
that I have yet to do for music --
for my queen, for my country.
Even if God were to grant me two days
for every one that I had left on this earth...
I stilI shouId not be abIe
to achieve everything.
Come, come, SulIivan. You're a genius.
I mereIy bask in your refIected gIory.
Oh, Gilbert, please.
But I'm somewhat at a Ioss.
What is the precise nature of your dilemma?
How shalI l put this?
My tunes, my -- my orchestrations
are becoming repetitious.
I've wrung alI the changes possibIe
in the way of variety of rhythm.
I have such respect for your words...
that I have continualIy kept down my music
in order that they can be heard.
It's no more than word setting.
SuIIivan, I have aIways subordinated
my words to your music.
- Oh, l think not.
- You've often expatiated to me and to others...
on the thorough good feeling
with which we've aIways worked together.
UnquestionabIy.
But l want a chance for my music...
to act in its own proper sphere.
It does. lt aIways has,
and it aIways wiIl.
It must be aIlowed to intensify
the emotional element...
not onIy of your words,
but of the situation...
which can be humorous, dramatic --
what you wiII.
Of course. It goes without saying.
You teach me the ABC of my profession.
Now, wouId you care for me
to read this to you or not?
- Where is it set?
- ln the SiciIian mountains.
PIenty of scope there for gypsy music,
one might suggest.
Now, the IocaI aIchemist
is kilIed in an expIosion...
and there amongst his effects
a chorus of viIlagers discover a potion.
- Magic potion, no doubt.
- Indeed.
- I thought as much.
- Now, the effect of this magic potion...
is to transform
the character who takes it...
into whatever he or she
is pretending to be.
Oh, Gilbert. You and your worId
of topsy-turvydom.
-
- ln 1 881 , it was a magic coin.
And before that, it was a magic lozenge.
And in 1 877, it was an eIixir.
In this instance, it is a magic potion.
"Act 1 . Scene: A mountain inn...
on a picturesque Sicilian pass.
A range of mountains
with Etna in the distance."
- l've made you some beef tea, Mr. Gilbert.
- Take it away.
You've not had anything
since yesterday afternoon, sir.
- Take it away.
- You can't work on an empty stomach.
Can't work at aIl, Mrs. Judd,
if I am being constantly pestered...
by interfering women with hot beef tea...
coId compresses, mustard pouItices
and excessive attacks of philanthropic zeaI.
- How's my wounded soldier?
- He's not doing as he's told, madam.
Oh, isn't he now?
Willie, are you intending
to visit the dentist tomorrow?
- You reaIly should try --
- Oh, for God's sake, you pair of bIoody harpies!
Get out! l'm working!
- WilIie --
- Madam.
l had rather spend an afternoon
in a Turkish bath with my mother...
than visit the dratted dentist.
Very weII.
Good night.
-
- She's being just a littIe bit tricky.
She's coming.
-
- WeII done, Mr. Gilbert.
Rinse.
She's a beauty.
- Open wide.
- Wh-Wh-What?
- Bite realIy hard.
-
I must say,
my wife and I did find Princess Ida...
rather too long, don't you know.
Try not to speak, old chap.
I do hope you've enjoyed your evening...
but before we say fareweII...
may I suggest an impromptu.
Mr. WaIter Simmonds
has generousIy offered...
to accompany me on the harmonium.
Now, we have another very young hopefuI
with us this evening...
who has kindIy agreed to accompany us
with a new composition of his own.
- "The Lost Chord."
-
Sir Arthur informed me
a few moments ago...
that he cannot entirely
recall his new piece.
-
- Merci, madame.
- lt's ridicuIous.
- It is.
I sent him the thing on Monday of Iast week.
He couId have read it on the same day...
or at the very least on the Tuesday.
Now 1 0 days have passed,
and l haven't heard a word.
- This concerns me greatly.
- Concerns me greatIy.
You're going to have to go
and see him, you know.
I'II be buggered if I do any such thing.
I present the man with my idea,
he rejects it.
I respond in detaiI to his misgivings,
but answer came there none.
Now, either he hasn't read it,
or he has read it and he doesn't Iike it...
and if he doesn't Iike it,
he shouId say so.
- Then at Ieast we shaIl know where we stand.
- Go and see him.
No, Carte. You go and see him.
I've no more shots in my Iocker.
"SulIivan and GiIbert"? Who are they?
At Ieast they're finally
going to revive The Sorcerer.
-  Only as a stopgap.
- lt'lI give us breathing space.
It won't run more than three months.
Your unbounded optimism
is inspiring, Carte.
I have the greatest confidence in The Sorcerer,
GiIbert, but I'm not in the business of revivaIs.
You are now, since you've decided
to withdraw the aiIing Princess Ida...
in spite of the cooIer weather.
-
-
Number one.
Number two.
Number three!
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
- How many today, Jessie?
- OnIy nine, aIas.
Oh, aIas.
I have received none today.
I'm utterIy neglected.
Have these, you poor souI.
I don't want your scraps, Jessie Bond.
Too vigorous, EmiIy. Apply the bandage.
Beg your pardon, Miss Bond.
ShaIl l ever find anybody again?
Oh, don't be so gloomy, Leonora.
SadIy, l seem to appeaI
only to eIderIy gentIemen.
Where are my young bucks and blades?
- Quel dommage.
- l've told you what you must do.
The Iast thing a girl wants
after an evening's performance...
is to have to go and sing
alI night for London society.
Idle Iadies and their odious husbands.
- One has to sing for one's supper.
- It's damned exhausting.
- l detest it.
- Anyway, they're not aIl married.
And some of them
are rather cute and courteous.
You have them dangIing on a Ieash, Jessie.
One must keep one's self amused,
don't you know.
It's so terribIy trying.
When l meet a gentIeman,
he invites me to supper...
I mention my little... secret...
and then he's off -- quick, smart.
"C'est impossible."
WeII, you shouIdn't reveaI your littIe secret...
untiI he's falIen hopeIessIy in love with you
and has asked you to marry him.
Oh, Jessie, for goodness sake.
"By the by, monsieur...
you do reaIize, do you not,
that l have a IittIe boy."
I couldn't possibIy pretend
that Stanton doesn't exist.
No. No, he's my precious littIe bundIe.
- How's his toothache?
- Earache.
He suffers terribIy, poor mite.
Would you like me
to lace you up now, Miss Bond?
Of course, EmiIy.
WeII, sureIy your Mr. Barnes wouId be wilIing.
Mr. Baker. Jessie, please.
I do not intend to become
a widow again before I'm 50.
No. Neither do I.
-
-
-
-
- Come in.
-
- Five minutes, Miss Braham.
- Thank you, Shrimp.
PIeasure, miss.
- Morning, Carte.
- Good morning, Gilbert. Cigar?
- Thank you very much.
-  GiIbert.
-  SuIlivan. May I?
-  CertainIy.
- Morning, D'Oyly.
- HeIlo, Arthur.
-  Good morning, Miss Lenoir.
- Good morning, everybody.
Good day, HeIen.
Now, gentIemen,
we alI know why we're here.
We seem to have come
to something of a standstiII.
- lndeed we have.
- Which, Arthur, is because --
Oh.
Because, HeIen...
I am unabIe to set the piece
that Gilbert persists in presenting.
The piece l persist in presenting, SuIIivan,
has substantiaIly altered each time.
Otherwise, there'd be littIe point
in my presenting it to you.
With great respect, oId chap,
it has not substantialIy aItered at aII.
You seem merely to have grafted
on to the first act the tantalizing suggestion...
that we are to be in the realms
of human emotion and probabiIity...
onIy to disappoint us by reverting
to your famiIiar worId of topsy-turvydom.
That which l have grafted onto Act 1 , SuIIivan,
has been specificalIy at your request.
And if you take exception
to topsy-turvydom...
you take exception to a great deaI
of my work of the past 25 years.
Not to mention much of what you and I
have written together since 1 871 .
- That is patent baIderdash.
- Is it?
GentIemen, if we might keep things cordiaI,
we may make some progress.
Arthur, can you realIy not see your way
to setting this new piece?
AIas, HeIen, I cannot.
Cannot or wiIl not?
I am truIy unabIe to set any piece
that is so profoundIy uncongeniaI to me.
UncongeniaI though it may be to you,
I must remind you...
that we here are conducting a business.
And may l remind you, HeIen,
that l am not a machine.
I wouId not suggest
for one moment that you were.
You all seem to be treating me
as a barreI organ.
You have but to turn my handIe
and, "Hey, presto"...
- out pops a tune.
- That's not strictIy true.
- Arthur.
- Oh, come now. That's unfair.
You are both contractualIy obIiged
to supply a new work on request.
The very act of signing a joint contract
dictates that we must be businessIike.
Yes, Mr. Gilbert.
And I was wondering whether you might
not be able to solve our wee difficulty.
- How, pray?
- By simpIy writing another libretto.
That's out of the question.
I have spent many long months
working at this pIay...
which l have every confidence wiII be
the best we have yet produced at the Savoy.
And to abandon it wouId be
not only criminal but wastefuI.
I see.
Now, had SuIIivan lodged his compIaint
at an earlier date...
that might have been a different matter.
I made my compIaint the moment
you presented me with the Iibretto.
The point being that I was unabIe
to present you with the libretto...
untiI you returned
from your grand tour of Europe.
That is neither here nor there.
No, SuIIivan. lndeed.
I was here, and you were there. Ha!
What I don't understand, Arthur,
is why you cannot set this piece.
You're our greatest composer.
SureIy you can do anything.
How very kind you are, HeIen.
But l say again to you alI,
I am at the end of my tether.
l have been repeating myself
in this class of work for too Iong...
and I wiIl not continue so to do.
Neither of us runs any risk
of repeating himself, SuIIivan.
This is an entirely new story,
quite unIike any other.
But, GiIbert, it bears a marked
similarity to The Sorcerer.
People are already saying
we're repeating ourseIves.
In what way is it similar to The Sorcerer?
Obviously, both invoIve characters who are
transformed by the taking of a magic potion...
a device which I continue
to find utterly contrived.
Every theatricaI performance
is a contrivance by its very nature.
Yes, but this piece consists entireIy
of an artificial and implausibIe situation.
If you wish to write a grand opera
about a prostitute...
dying of consumption in a garret...
I suggest you contact Mr. Ibsen in OsIo.
I am sure he wiII be able to furnish you
with something suitabIy duIl.
- Gilbert, please.
- Hmm?
- l do beg your pardon, Miss Lenoir.
- Oh, no. Granted.
The opportunity to treat a situation
of tender, human and dramatic interest...
is one I long for
more than anything eIse in the worId.
lf that is your sincere desire,
I would be wilIing, with Carte's permission...
to withdraw my services for one term,
to aIlow you to write a grand opera...
with a coIlaborator with whom
you have a closer affinity than myseIf.
- No, GiIbert.
- l'm in earnest, SuIIivan.
No doubt that is something
we shaIl be pursuing in the future.
Indeed.
WeIl, that is your prerogative, Carte.
However, we are concerned with the present.
Arthur, wiII you or wiIl you not set
Mr. Gilbert's new and originaI work?
Ma beIle, Helen, ce n'est pas possible.
Truly?
I'm afraid so.
That being the case...
Mr. GiIbert, wouId l be right in supposing
that you remain unable to accommodate us?
Indeed, Miss Lenoir.
I have had what l deem
to be a good idea...
and such ideas are not three a penny.
What a pity.
This wiIl be a very sad day
for many thousands of peopIe.
WeIl, gentIemen, I don't know about you,
but speaking for myself...
I could murder a pork chop.
If you'II excuse me,
I shalI retrieve my hat.
- Gilbert.
- SuIlivan.
Good day to you both.
No doubt we shalI be in communication
in the near future.
- Gilbert.
- Good day, Mr. Gilbert.
Good day.
You know where to find me.
Arthur.
- Where have you been?
- Shopping.
Surprising.
I was in Knightsbridge,
and guess what l saw.
An eIephant giIding two IiIies.
-  No.
- l haven't the Ieast idea.
- Three tiny Japanese ladies.
- How do you know they were Japanese?
Because they were wearing
their funny dressing gowns.
Had they just got up?
No. There's a Japanese exhibition
at Humphreys' Hall.
Oh, yes. Japanese viIIage
of some sort or other.
Yes! Yes. lt sounds rather intriguing.
Might we visit?
No.
But, WiIlie, the whoIe of London
wiII be going.
PreciseIy.
Don't be so stubborn.
I have other things on my mind.
You know that.
Yes, l do know that, WiIIie,
and I understand.
But a Iittle distraction wilI do you good.
- Kitty, I don't want to be distracted.
- Yes, you do.
Oh, do I? You know my mind
better than I do, do you?
l know you better
than you think I do, WiIIie.
Lucy, if you wish to visit Humphreys' HaII,
by aII means do so...
but I shalI not accompany you
for alI the tea in China.
-
-
What are you writing, sir?
- Good afternoon, Lucy.
- Maude!
Good heavens.
What are you two doing here?
- How are you, Schwenck?
- Mmm.
- How joIIy. You must join us.
- Unfortunately, we're just about to Ieave.
- Oh, what a pity.
- What do you make of it aII?
- lt's quite entrancing.
- lt's frightful.
- How's Mother?
-  Quite weII.
- She's in bed.
-  Oh.
Come aIong, Maude.
Oh, yes, FIorence.
We mustn't keep you. Good day to you.
- Do give her my best.
- Of course.
- WeII, au revoir.
-  Good day, Maude.
Au revoir.
-  My goodness.
- Mmm.
It's perfectIy green.
- Spinach water.
- Oh, WilIie.
Thank you very much.
- l beg your pardon?
-
-  Oh, she speaks EngIish.
- What did she say?
- She said, "Sixpence, pIease."
-  Sixpence, pIease.
-  Ah. Sixpence.
-
- Thank you very much.
- Arigato gozaimasu.
Sixpence, please.
-
-
-
-
Here we are, sir.
- There, Pidgeon.
- Very good, sir.
Comme ca.
Yes, sir.
Show it to me.
To your right.
Bit more.
Good. Down a bit.
Down a bit. There.
- Mark it there.
- Yes, sir.
Give it to me.
Thank you, sir.
It's a fine-looking instrument, sir.
Now, would that be Spanish or ItaIian?
- Neither, Pidgeon.
- Of course, sir.
Good.
- ExceIIent. Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.
Do we suppose that Lucy is with chiId?
I beg your pardon, Mama?
Lucy.
Is she enceinte? With chiId?
Whyever wouId you think that?
One wouldn't have said she was sickly...
although she did ask after you, Mama.
- What did he say?
- Who?
Schwenck.
He said nothing, Mama.
Nothing. Nothing. AbsoIutely nothing!
Your dear son said very IittIe...
and what he did say,
I have aIready told you.
Now...
do you care for this or not?
It is merely a piece of wood.
Very weIl.
I shalI keep it for my coIlection.
- Maude?
- Yes, Mama?
Never bear a humorous baby.
I shalI endeavor not to, Mama.

"The Mikado; or, the Town of Titipu."
-
- "Act 1 .
Scene:
Courtyard of Ko-Ko's paIace in Titipu.
Japanese nobIes discovered
standing and sitting...
in attitudes suggested by native drawings.
Chorus: 'If you want to know who we are,
we are gentIemen of Japan.
On many a vase and jar, on many a screen and fan,
we figure in Iively paint...
our attitudes queer and quaint,
you're wrong if you think it ain't.
-
- lf you think we are worked by strings...
Iike a Japanese marionette,
you don't understand these things.
It is simpIy court etiquette.
Perhaps you suppose this throng
can't keep it up aIl day long.
If that's your idea, you're wrong.'
Enter Nanki-Poo in great excitement.
He carries a native guitar on his back
and a bundIe of baIIads in his hand.
Recitative Nanki-Poo:
'GentIemen, I pray you teII me
where a IoveIy maiden dweIIeth...
named Yum-Yum, the ward of Ko-Ko.
In pity speak. Oh, speak, I pray you."'
"'l hurried back at once,
in the hope of finding Yum-Yum...
at liberty to listen to my protestations.'
Pish-Tush: 'It is true that Ko-Ko
was condemned to death for fIirting...
but he was reprieved at the Iast moment...
and raised to the exaIted rank
of Lord High Executioner...
under the foIlowing
remarkabIe circumstances.'
Song, Pish-Tush:
'Our great Mikado, virtuous man...
when he to ruIe our Iand began...
resolved to try a plan whereby
young men might best be steadied.
So he decreed in words succinct...
that alI who flirted, Ieered or winked...
unless connubialIy linked...
shouId forthwith be beheaded.
And l expect you'Il aII agree
that he was right to so decree...
and I am right, and you are right...
and alI is right as right can be.
This stern decree, you'Il understand,
caused great dismay throughout the Iand.
For young and old and shy and boId
were equaIIy affected.
The youth who winked a roving eye...
or breathed a non-connubial sigh...
was thereupon condemned to die.
He usuaIly objected.
And you'II aIlow, as l expect,
that he was right to so object.
And I am right, and you are right,
and everything is quite correct.
And so we straight let out on baiI
a convict from the county jaiI...
whose head was next, on some pretext,
condemned to be mown off.
And made him headsman, for we said...
"Who's next to be 'decapited'
cannot cut off another's head...
untiI he's cut his own off."
And we are right, I think you'lI say...
to argue in this kind of way.
And I am right, and you are right,
and aIl is right. Too-IooraIlay.'
Chorus. End of song."
Highly amusing, WiIIie.
- Fatuous.
- Oh.
Surely Arthur Iikes it.
He hasn't said otherwise.
It certainly is rich
in human emotion and probabiIity.
HardIy.
"Enter Pooh-Bah."
Tragedy.
- It is.
- Che brutto.
AbsoIuteIy.
He simply hasn't pIayed with a straight bat.
- Who's that?
- His Majesty, the Mahdi.
- Oh, yes.
- No. lt just isn't cricket.
Quite so. It's completeIy contrary
to the ruIes of engagement.
The man was surrounded on aIl sides
and massacred merciIessIy.
"What fulI fortune doth the thick lips owe."
- What does that mean?
- Philistine.
lt baffIes me
that you're baffIed, Barrington.
- Hmm?
- The Hottentot in the desert doesn't play cricket.
His natural habitation
being the "jungly bungIy" tree...
he is as yet hardIy abIe to walk upright,
don't you know.
We strive to bring them civiIization...
and this is their gratitude.
Did you know that 56 families
were sIaughtered on the island of Skye?
ReaIly? When was that?
- '82, I think.
- And who perpetrated the outrage, pray?
Oh, mereIy the, uh, English militia.
- Extraordinary.
- Buon appetito.
- ShalI we indulge in another dozen?
- I rather think we ought, don't you?
I think we might.
WouId you care for a second fish, Lely?
- Oh.
- Or a veritable shoaI, perhaps.
l have had an ample sufficiency,
thank you very much, my wee man.
I have an appointment with Carte
this afternoon.
- At what hour?
- 5:00.
Curious. l shaII be with him
at half past 4:00.
That's funny.
I don't have a meeting with him at 4:00.
And it is my firm intention
to prize open his purse.
It wiIl take a far stronger man than you,
Mr. Barrington...
to fulfiIl that hercuIean labor.
And what's your mission,
Captain Grossmith?
Oh, there are certain Iittle matters.
I shouId rather Iike to offer you
an increase in saIary, George.
- Oh? lndeed?
- lndeed.
That's most benevoIent of you, Mr. Carte.
- lt's no less than you deserve, George.
- Thank you.
And by how much, might one inquire?
By seven and a haIf percent.
Hmm.
Seven and a haIf.
Now, that wouId work out at, uh --
- Thirty pounds per week.
- Thirty. Hmm.
I see.
WeIl, $30 per week wasn't quite
the sum l had in mind...
as l wended my weary way here
this afternoon.
Indeed.
As that wouId be three consecutive productions
with onIy a negIigibIe increase.
I don't consider an increase of two pounds per week
over 1 2 months negIigibIe, George.
One might have thought
that the name of George Grossmith --
my not inconsiderabIe contribution --
would have been more favorably recognized.
You do receive considerably more
than anyone else, George.
- Do l?
- Mmm.
We shouId be terribIy sorry to Iose you.
Gilbert has written you
a particuIarIy fine part in the new piece.
PreciseIy, as one wouId expect.
However, I should judge an increase
of a paItry two pounds per week...
to be whoIIy unacceptabIe,
not to mention miIdIy insuIting...
if one may say so.
And what figure had you in mind,
Mr. Grossmith?
Uh --
Forgive me. I seem to have
lost my train of thought.
I --
Are you unwelI, George?
I fear l may have come over a bit queer.
- Most embarrassing.
- You must take a IittIe brandy.
"A little water cIears us of this deed."
- l blame Grossmith for this.
- OnIy Grossmith?
Thank you, Helen.
Confounded glutton.
Are you feeIing better?
Oh, l do beg your pardon.
This is awfuIIy embarrassing.
Not at aII, Rutty.
Now, why don't we return
to the subject of your saIary?
Oh. Yes.
WelI, I must decIare that
I'm rather at a Ioss for words, D'Oyly.
- Excuse me.
-
Oh, l do beg your pardon.
This is a baIly nightmare, damn it.
I shaIl be in my dressing room.
The more l see of men,
the more I admire dogs.
l'm soon to have a meeting
concerning the cast for the next opera.
Yes, indeed.
l've heard a Iittle rumor that perhaps I should
be playing the part of a 1 4-year-oId schooIgirI.
Someone has been telIing taIes.
They have indeed, Mr. Carte.
Mr. GiIbert wiIl be very angry.
Mmm!
With reference
to your engagement for the opera...
I have a great concern
about your IittIe weakness.
I'm -- l'm a Iittle shocked, Mr. Carte.
I reaIly do believe that my behavior
this Iast year has been exempIary.
l'm pIeased to say
your tendency has improved...
but I am concerned about the future.
Yes. You're perhaps suggesting, Mr. Carte...
that I shan't be performing
in the next production.
Yes, I'm afraid l am.
But the outcome of that, Leonora,
is in your own hands.
Sometimes, Mr. Carte,
I can be a very siIly young woman.
You have an extraordinary taIent.
It saddens me beyond measure
to see someone throw it away.
I assure you, Mr. Carte,
that I shalI be in tip-top form.
I'm very pIeased to hear that.
Much reIieved.
Do we have an understanding?
Yes, we do, Mr. Carte.
Good.
- Chop-chop, Butt. How long do we have?
- Eight minutes, Mr. Temple.
Oh, joIIy good.
- Shocking news from Khartoum.
- Indeed.
UnbearabIe.
- Something wiIl have to be done, tout de suite.
- AbsoIutely.
Mrs. TempIe hit the naiI on the head
this afternoon, as per usual.
What did she say?
"The nation loses a hero,
but the famiIy Ioses a Ioved one."
Oh, how apt.
A perspicacious woman is Mrs. TempIe.
Hat!
Consider this, my dear Butt.
Is it not the inevitable fate
of the professional soIdier...
that he may perish on the fieId of battIe?
Indeed, sir.
But, Dickie, have you heard
the real news of the day?
Yes, the Fenian bomb.
Oh, dreadfuI.
- No. Grossmith and Barrington.
- What?
- They're off tonight.
- No!
- Yes.
- Both of them?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Oysters.
-
- We shared Iuncheon together.
- Did you swalIow?
- No! l chose the soIe.
- Off the bone?
- Yes. lt was rather succuIent.
- Wise man.
- Oysters can kilI, you know?
- Oh, unquestionabIy.
I had an aunt --
choked on a scaIlop at Herne Bay.
- ReaIly?
- Tragic.
Oh, dear.
Yes, they were away to see Carte.
- Oh, really.
- Mmm.
- WiIl you be lobbying?
- No. l'lI just wait for my summons.
Quite right, dear boy.
One shouId be rewarded
on one's merits...
not on one's abiIity to ingratiate oneseIf
with the management.
ParticularIy when the management
have difficulty...
in Iocating the reIative whereabouts
of the arse and the elbow.
Serves them both right.
Enter!
Five minutes, please,
Mr. TempIe, Mr. Lely.
- Thank you, Shrimp.
- Merci, Crevette.
One, two, three --
-
- DoIce.
-
- Expansive.
-
- Good.
-
- Rutty, temper your voIume, please.
-
- And now.
-
- Good.
BoviII, that's very good.
But I've gone to considerabIe pains
to provide you with tripIets.
- Triplets, Sir Arthur, yes.
- And on his saIary!
- Rutty, please.
- ApoIogy.
Consequently,
if you wouId be so kind as to trip.
- Of course, Sir Arthur.
- Thank you. One, two, three, four.
Now, you see, BoviII?
Very much better.
- Thank you, Sir Arthur.
- The new man's doing awfulIy weII.
- Quite splendid.
- Thank you, gentIemen.
Breathe, BoviII. Breathe.
- lt's piano, Barrington. Piano.
- I'Il do my best.
As many P's as you can muster, RutIand.
Without landing us aIl in the soup.
-
- One, two, three, four.
-
- And going on.
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
GentIemen, unpocopiu vivo. Hmm?
Now, before the doubIe bar Iine,
it's one, two, three, four.
And afterwards. One, two, three, four.
Clear? Very quiet.
From here, pIease.
One, two, three, four.
-
- Good!
-
- Tosto.
-
- More. Good.
-
- Bravo.
- Goodness.
- SpIendid.
- ExceIlent.
Louis. Wir haben etwas Kaffee.
- Your coffee is ready, Sir Arthur.
- Thank you.
- My word.
- Is it?
First-rate.
- Rutty, do go through.
- Thanks, oId chap.
Do one's hands remain within,
Madame Leon?
Oh, no, my dear.
No, no, no. Look. Here.
- Comme ca.
- Oh, l see!
- Voila.
-
Are you stiIl troubled
by your understandings, Miss Bond?
- l'm in much pain this afternoon.
- l'm so sorry to hear it.
Tres jolie, tres jolie. Superbe.
Such exquisite embroidery.
What are you wearing
underneath your gown, SibyI?
Only my friIlies.
AIas, no corsets, I'm afraid to say.
Alice, vite!
Oh, shaII we be reveaIing a littIe,
Madame Leon?
I certainIy hope not, Miss Braham.
- Oh, what a pity.
-
Do take care, Miss Morton!
Makes one rather drowsy.
- lt does Iook comfortable, SibyI.
- Indeed it is.
- La kimono.
- Ooh.
Doucement, doucement.
- GentIy, gentIy.
- Ooh.
The siIk is subIime, Madame Leon.
Indeed. From Mr. Liberty's store,
don't you know.
Bona fide Japanese,
with just a soupcon from gay Paris.
- C'est magnifique.
- Oui!
ls one to presume one is to be prevented
from wearing one's corset, Madame Leon?
Miss Bond, none of the Iadies shaII be
wearing corsets during the performance.
That's simpIy preposterous.
Our aim is to emuIate the Japanese ladies...
and Japanese Iadies
are as thin as thread paper...
- inasmuch a Roman column
as opposed to a Grecian urn.
- Quite so.
I fear for my reputation, don't you know.
Miss Bond, l am foIIowing
Mr. Gilbert's instructions.
Mr. Gilbert desires the Japanese appearance.
And that which Mr. Gilbert desires,
Mr. Gilbert must have.
Fait accompli.
One can hardIy cut a dash
in this dressing gown.
Oh, do stop fussing, Jessie. PIease.
- lt's delightfuI, Madame Leon.
- Thank you, Miss Braham.
- It's shapeless.
- Yes, Miss Bond, it is shapeIess.
Japanese Iadies are most shapeIess.
But there is no need
for you Iadies to be shapeIess.
l have devised a soIution,
if I may crave your indulgence.
Miss Morton.
Miss Grey, wouId you kindIy raise your arms?
- Of course.
- Merci, merci.
Now, the bow goes at the back...
the sash at the front, lined with caIico.
Now, tournez.
Tournez, s'il vous plait.
Now, this may be Iaced
as tightly as you require.
Tournez. A gauche. A gauche.
-
- Oui.
So you see, in effect, it is a corset.
Where's the whaIebone?
There are no bones, Miss Bond.
WelI, Madame Leon, I do fear that if there
are no bones, then it is plainly not a corset.
No, Miss Bond, it is not a corset,
but it may serve for a corset.
lt may give you the shape you desire.
Tighter, please, Miss Morton. Tighter.
I cannot appear on stage
without a corset.
It certainly feeIs like a corset, Jessie.
You do resemble a birthday gift, SibyI.
l couId eat you.
Do forgive me, Miss Bond.
One is working
to the best of one's abiIities...
although I fear sometimes
it is not appreciated.
And that is the haori.
Am I correct, WiIhelm?
Quite so, Mr. GiIbert.
As opposed to the zori,
which is the stocking, is it not?
- The stockings are the tabi, sir.
- Ah, tabi.
- The sandaIs are the zori.
- ExactIy so.
I'm beginning to get
the measure of this, Grossmith.
Hmm.
- Mr. Gilbert.
- Lely?
Is this to be the Iength of my gown
for Nanki-Poo?
I believe so. WiIheIm?
- lndeed it is.
- Yes.
Do you not consider it to be perhaps...
a Iittle too short?
- Too short for what?
- For propriety.
Might it not be rather unseemIy?
- I'm sorry. UnseemIy to whom?
- To the audience of the Savoy Theatre, sir.
Hmm. I shouIdn't have thought so.
In any case, I shalI be the judge of that.
Rest assured, Mr. Lely, my designs are properly
researched and authentic to the last thread.
Hmm. No offense to you, Mr. WiIheIm,
but your properIy authentic costume...
seems to have left me
rather in the buff somewhat.
Quite.
No more in the buff than Japanese peasants
have been for the Iast 800 years, Mr. LeIy.
May I draw your attention to the fact,
Mr. WiIheIm...
that I am not, actuaIIy, a Japanese peasant.
No. You're a Scotch actor who is
taking the part of a Japanese prince...
who is posing as an itinerant minstreI.
LeIy, I wouId be only too happy
for the tailor here to chop off some of my surplus...
and stitch it to the hem of your kiIt.
-
-  Thank you, Grossmith.
I am sure we shaIl reap the benefits
or your remonstrations in the fuIlness of time.
Yes, G.G. Do you not agree with me
that this garment is rather vuIgar?
I do, as it happens.
Mr. Grossmith,
kindly oblige me by removing your hat.
Why, sir? Are you ready for me?
WouId that l were, sir.
And l'lI thank you not to refer
to my designs as vulgar, Mr. Lely.
Mr. WiIhelm, to my eyes...
your designs are not onIy vuIgar,
but obscene.
How dare you, sir!
Strong words, LeIy.
What the deuce do you mean?
Mr. Gilbert, I'm a respectabIy married man,
and I love my wife dearly.
Now, one of the few pleasures
that she has enjoyed...
since the untimeIy demise
of my beloved mother-in-Iaw...
has been to watch me
perform upon the stage.
But l am not prepared to allow her
to suffer the embarrassment...
of seeing me flaunted before the pubIic
Iike a half-dressed performing dog!
You have my sympathies, Lely.
But, unfortunateIy,
your avocation as an actor...
compels you on occasion to endure
the most ignominious indignities.
As Grossmith wilI doubtless testify.
Without question, sir.
Mr. LeIy, Iet me be clear.
I wiII not alter one stitch of your costume
to protect the sensibilities of your wife...
your chiIdren or any other member
of your unfortunate famiIy.
Mr. Wilhelm, I would strongly advise you...
not to speak of my famiIy
in such a despicable manner!
Sir. WiIl you remove your corset?
- I beg your pardon?
- KindIy remove your corset, Mr. Lely.
It'Il spoiI the hang of the cloth.
Mr. Gilbert.
I never perform without my corset.
What, never?
-  I'm afraid not, sir.
- Why not?
One cannot produce
the required vocal vigor...
without the necessary diaphragmaticaI
support that the corset affords.
Come, come, LeIy.
This is not grand opera in MiIan.
It is mereIy Iow burIesque in a smaII theater
on the banks of the river Thames.
You have a fine, strong voice...
which wiIl be more than adequate
for our purposes, with or without the corset.
KindIy remove it this instant.
You may retire behind the screen
if you wish.
Very weIl, sir.
But may I just say that, in five years
of IoyaI service to this company...
I have never, untiI this moment,
lodged a singIe compIaint.
Your nobIe restraint
has been much appreciated.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Seymour.
Now, Miss Sixpence PIease,
would you kindly come along with me?
Thank you very much.
Make haste. Make haste. Johnny.
Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentIemen, l'd just like
to introduce you aII to Miss Sixpence PIease...
the young lady of whom some of you wilI have
heard me speak with reverence and respect.
Thank you. Very good.
Kindly make yourselves comfortabIe.
PIease be seated. Thank you.
Ah, sir, my apologies.
I've been neglecting you.
WouId you like to come this way?
It's alI right, Seymour. He can use your chair.
Far more appropriate.
Here you are, sir. Be seated here.
Very good indeed.
Pride of place, sir.
Make yourseIf comfortabIe.
CeIlier.
Yes, now -- D'Auban!
WiIl you kindly withdraw
to the side of the stage immediately?
- Johnny.
- Thank you, Mr. D'Auban.
Ladies, wiIl you take up
your fans, please?
What l'd Iike you to do, sir,
is to observe the proceedings.
Will you kindIy give aIl your attention
to the performance? Thank you.
Barker, what are you doing?
Do you propose to join in?
- My dancing days are long over, Mr. GiIbert.
-
Over, Barker, but not forgotten.
Ladies, opening attitudes, s'il vous plait.
From the beginning of the song.
Counting two bars before, Mrs. RusseII.
Thank you.
One, two. Two, two.
-
- Fans.
AII fans rising sIowIy. And --
-  Stop! Thank you very much.
-
Now, Miss Sixpence -- Carte.
l beg your pardon.
Let me introduce our Japanese guests.
Ladies.
- Mr. D'OyIy Carte, our proprietor.
- Sir.
- Please continue.
- Thank you very much.
Now, Miss Sixpence Please.
That performance that you have just witnessed
was not even remoteIy Japanese. Am I right?
Japanese.
- Sir. Japanese?
- Japanese.
- No.
- No.
- Thank you very much.
- Excuse me, Mr. GiIbert, sir, if I may.
- Japanese.
- Japanese.
- Yes.
- Yes.
He hasn't got the faintest idea
what you're taIking about.
- That's bIatantIy obvious, D'Auban.
-
AIlora, parlate italiano?
If he doesn't speak EngIish,
he's hardIy Iikely to speak ItaIian.
- ls he, Mrs. RusseII? For goodness sake!
- I beg your pardon, Mr. Gilbert.
-
-  Mrs. RusseII!
- lt's a waste of time.
- Uh!
Now, if you three Iadies
would come with me, please.
PIease go to the back of the stage.
Thank you.
Yes, yes, come upstage.
As quickIy as you can.
- Come aIong, come aIong.
- Thank you.
-
-
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much indeed.
One, two, three.
Very good. Thank you.
Now, what l wouId Iike you to do...
when the music commences,
I wouId like you to advance downstage.
Thank you very much. CeIIier.
One, two. Two, two.
-
-  Off you go.
Come along. Come along.
Can we get --
- Stop, stop.
- Thank you, Mrs. RusseII.
WilI this take Iong?
I'm to arrange a mazurka at 4:00.
lt is apparent
that I have not made myseIf clear.
Now, when Mrs. RusseIl commences
pIaying on the pianoforte --
diddle-dum, diddIe-dee,
diddIe-dee, diddIe-dee --
what l wouId Iike you to do
is to advance downstage.
Comme ca.
Diddle-dum,
diddIe-do, diddIe-dee, diddle-dee.
-
- You understand?
-
- I think you do.
Let's try once more. CeIIier.
- One, two. Two, two.
-
DiddIe-dee. Come aIong!
Come aIong. That's it.
Very good. ExceIlent. That is exactIy it.
Thank you very much indeed.
ExceIlent. First-rate!
Thank you very much indeed.
Good. Now, D'Auban,
that is exactIy what I want.
I do beg your pardon, Mr. GiIbert, but I appear
to have missed the point somewhat.
- That is the very effect I need.
- And what effect exactly is that?
- Did you not see what they did?
- Yes. They waIked downstage.
They appeared to me
to be ambling aIong the Strand.
SimpIy waIking.
They walked downstage
in the Japanese manner.
They waIked downstage in the Japanese manner
because they are Japanese.
Exactly. And that is precisely
why they are here.
Our three Iittle maids are not Japanese.
However, they are very funny.
No funnier, however, than they wouId be
if they alI sat down on pork pies.
-
- Young felIer-me-lad, Mr. GiIbert, sir.
I've arranged Terpsichore -- Chinese, Japanese,
everybody-wash-your-knees--
for pantomime, burlesque and the baIIet
for many a season, aIways to great accIaim.
D'Auban, this is not low burIesque.
This is an entireIy originaI Japanese opera.
Now, Miss Bond, Miss Braham and Miss Grey,
kindIy resume your opening positions.
PIease be seated once more. Thank you.
Please be seated. Thank you.
Thank you.
Come aIong. Come along, tortoise.
Quickly, quickIy.
What l wouId like you to do now
is to perform it...
just as you have seen our guests perform it,
thank you very much.
- Mr. GiIbert.
- Yes, Jessie?
WouId that be exactly
as we have just seen demonstrated?
ExactIy.
Without using Monsieur D'Auban's steps,
Mr. GiIbert?
I want you to perform it preciseIy as you
have seen our Japanese friends perform it.
Thank you very much!
Exactement. C'est pas difficile.
In other words,
very sIowly and very boringly.
One, two. Two, two.
Very good. First-rate.
- That is exactIy right. Thank you very much indeed.
-  Thank you, Mrs. RusselI.
I haven't Iaughed so much
since me tights caught fire...
in Harlequin Meets ltchity-Switch in the Nitch.
Decorum in rehearsal, Monsieur D'Auban.
-
- That's the way, yes. Very good indeed.
Closed. Then hit.
Try them together.
Try them together. Try -- Try together.
Three of them, do it aIl together --
the same noise.
-  One, two, three.
-
Ah! ExceIlent.
Laughing. Ha, ha. Chaffing. Ha, ha.
Nectar quaffing. Ha, ha, ha, ha.
But condemned to die is he...
wretched, meritorious be.
The Mikado Ieads Katisha off.
Upstairs.
Thus. The traditionaI Japanese posture...
as adopted by welI-meaning
but misguided underlings...
upon the departure
of their august superiors.
Thank you.
WouId that be a recognized
Japanese attitude, sir?
Not as yet, Grossmith, but I have
every confidence that it wiII become one.
Much obIiged.
I'm sure I've seen this
on a vase somewhere.
Jessie.
Thank you, Mr. Gilbert.
Ha! Pretty picture. Eh, Seymour?
Charming, sir.
The Mikado has left, Grossmith.
WeIl, another fine mess
you've got us into.
No, Grossmith.
My line is, "A nice mess you've got us into."
Nice mess.
And l shouId be much obIiged
if you wouId play it comme ca.
WeIl -- a nice mess you've got us into.
Righto, sir.
- WeIl --
- No.
"WeIl!"
WeII --
a nice mess you've got us into...
with your nodding head and the deference
due to a man of pedigree.
Mr. Grossmith, you are under sentence of death
by something Iingering --
either boiling oiI or meIted lead.
Kindly bear that in mind.
Thank you.
WeIl, a nice mess you've got us into...
with your nodding head and the deference
due to a man of pedigree.
Merely corroborative detail
intended to give artistic verisimiIitude...
to a baId and unconvincing narrative.
No, Barrington.
"An otherwise baId
and unconvincing narrative."
Was that incorrect?
I -- I do beg your pardon.
No, sir. It has onIy
just occurred to me.
Oh.
To an otherwise baId
and unconvincing narrative.
- Much better.
- "Corrobatitive" detaiI indeed.
Corroborative detaiI.
Corrobatitive.
- Corroborative.
- Corroborative.
Thank you. SpIendid.
Corroborative detaiI indeed.
Corroborative fiddIestick!
And you're just as bad as he is
with your cock-and-bulI stories.
"Cock and a bulI."
Cock and a buII --
about catching his eye --
- Line.
- "And his whistIing an air."
- And his whistIing hair.
-
Boiling oil, Grossmith. MeIted lead.
Beg pardon, sir.
About catching his eye
and his whistIing an air.
But that's so like you.
You must stick your oar in.
"You must put in your oar."
Over again.
And you're just as bad as he is...
with your cock-and-a-buII stories...
about catching his eye
and his whistIing an air.
But that's so like you.
You must put your oar in.
"You must put in your oar."
Over again.
And you're just as bad as he is...
with your cock-and-a-buII stories about
catching his eye and his whistIing an air.
But that's so like you.
You must put in your oar.
Yes, but how about your big right arm?
Yes, and your snickersnee.
WeII, weII, never mind that now.
There's onIy one thing to be done.
Nanki-Poo hasn't started yet.
He must come to life again. At once!
- Appear! Appear! Appear!
-
Yes. Now, since Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum have
decided not to grace us with their presence...
it would transpire, Mr. Seymour,
that your moment of gIory has finaIly arrived.
Oh, sir.
On your feet, Slopkins!
Whence wouId you
like us both to enter, sir?
The honeymoon couple appear
at the upstage right entrance...
traveIing in a westerIy direction
towards Knightsbridge...
when your journey is interrupted
by Mr. Grossmith.
- Mr. Gilbert.
- Jessie?
- Might I use my stick?
- By aIl means. Are you troubIed?
I'm quite alI right, thank you.
-  WelI, weII.
-  WelI, weII.
Well, weIl, never mind that now.
There's onIy one thing to be done.
Nanki-Poo hasn't started yet.
He must come to life again. At once!
-
- Here he comes.
Here, Nanki-Poo.
I have good news for you.
You're reprieved.
l beg your pardon, Mr. GiIbert.
I have failed to provide a vaIise.
Indeed, Seymour. And you have
also failed to provide two actors.
Pray continue.
- Oh! But it's too Iate!
-
l am a dead man,
and I'm off for my honeymoon.
Uncanny, is it not?
Mr. Seymour, pIease inform Mr. LeIy
that his services wiII no longer be required.
-
- Thank you very much, sir.
Nonsense.
A terribIe thing has happened.
It seems you're the son of the Mikado.
A terrible thing has just happened, Grossmith.
You've become a cockney!
I thought one would suggest something
of his Iowly station...
being a cheap taiIor and aII.
Rubbish. We're in Japan, for heaven's sake,
not Stepney or Bow. Do it properIy.
Oh. Very weII.
Nonsense.
A terribIe thing has happened.
It seems you're the son of the Mikado.
Yes. But that happened some time ago.
Is this a time for airy persifIage?
Persiflage, Grossmith.
- Is it?
- lt is.
Is this a time for airy  persiflage?
Doesn't sound right to me.
Persiflage, mirage, fromage.
- Decoupage.
- Exactly.
Your father is here, and with Katisha.
Katisha.
It amuses me to say Kah-tish-ah.
It doesn't amuse me, Grossmith.
Nor does it scan.
My father? And with Katisha?
Yes. And he wants you particuIarly.
So does she.
Oh, but he's married now.
But bIess my heart,
what has that to do with it?
Katisha cIaims me in marriage...
but I can't marry her
because l'm married aIready.
ConsequentIy,
she wiIl insist on my execution.
And if I am executed,
my wife wilI have to be buried aIive.
You see our difficulty.
Yes.
- l don't know what's to be done.
- Make as to leave. Stop him.
There's one chance for you.
If you couId persuade Katisha
to marry you...
she wouId have no further cIaim on me.
And in that case, I couId come to life
without any fear of being put to death.
I? Marry Katisha?
I realIy think it's the only course.
My good girl, have you seen her?
- She's something awfuI.
- "Appalling."
- Something appalling.
- Ah, that's onIy her face.
Ah, that's only her face.
She has a Ieft elbow
which peopIe come miIes to see.
I am toId her right heel
is much admired by connoisseurs.
Yes. CouId we do that line again,
pIease, Barrington?
And this time, try it in EngIish.
l'm toId her right heeI
is much admired by connoisseurs.
- That better, sir?
- MarginaIIy.
My good sir...
I decline to pin my heart
upon any Iady's right heeI.
Make as to leave. Stop him.
It comes to this.
While Katisha is singIe,
I prefer to be a disembodied spirit.
When Katisha is married...
existence wilI be as welcome
as the fIowers in spring.
Tra-Ia.
Very good.
Over again, if you please.
- And!
-
Good.
-
- Thank you, gentIemen.
Not surprisingly...
we were somewhat foxed
by the abbreviated restatement.
Uh, Ietter "A."
Discord bordering on cacophony.
Second fiddIes?
Indeed, Sir Arthur.
My mistake, Sir Arthur.
I do beg your pardon.
- My error, sir.
- l suspect we were a trifle earIy.
Indeed you were, Mr. Harris,
and more than a trifIe.
I realIy don't mind
whose mistake it --
it was, Mr. Plank,
as long as it doesn't happen again.
The entry is on the third beat of the bar,
not the first.
- l think that's quite cIear.
- Yes, sir.
- It is, sir. Yes.
- Very good.
And now, we return to Mr. HurIey.
- Good morning, Mr. HurIey.
- Good morning, Dr. SuIlivan.
- You was Iate, Mr. 'Urley.
-
- My profuse apoIogies to you, sir.
- Thank you.
I assumed it to be an error
on the part of the copyist.
The second beat of the previous bar...
appeared to me to be masquerading
as the first beat of the next.
Most alarming. But it was not.
Oh, indeed not,
for which I do apologize, Dr. SuIIivan.
Mr. HurIey, once again --
saving your bIushes, Maestro --
Dr. SuIIivan is dead.
Long Iive Sir Arthur.
Thank you, Mr. CeIIier.
- Mr. Tripp.
- Sir?
Owing to the somewhat tardy entry
of Mr. Hurley...
- you quite understandabIy foIlowed suit.
- AbsoluteIy, sir.
So assuming that Mr. HurIey does enter
at the correct pIace, you will too.
- Assuming he does, sir, I wiIl, sir.
-  Very good.
- Thank you, Mr. Tripp.
- Thank you, sir.
CapitaI. Uh, gentIemen, once more.
From the beginning, please.
I shalI give you one bar.
-
-
Did l say "Come in"?
You are required in the auditorium,
Mr. Grossmith.
- l requested five minutes' grace.
- You have had eight, sir.
Mayn't it wait until tomorrow?
No, sir.
Thank you, Miss Braham.
- ls that everyone, Seymour?
- AlI present and correct, Mr. GiIbert.
Good.
I won't keep you, ladies and gentIemen.
I know we're aIl extremely tired...
and Iooking forward to getting home
to our yawning beds.
Observations.
The use of fans, particuIarIy in Act 1 ,
was fIabby and erratic.
- Very scrappy.
- lndeed, D'Auban.
We shaII address this
tomorrow afternoon at 2:00, Seymour.
Two of the cIock.
Ko-Ko's entrance.
Mr. Kent and Mr. Conyngham.
PIease ensure that you do not
flinch at Mr. Grossmith's sword.
You must have confidence that he
is not about to chop off your heads...
even if it may appear that that
is your inevitabIe fate.
-
- l take it, Mr. Grossmith...
that this evening's performance
was an aberration.
Grossmith.
I beg your pardon, sir.
Were you addressing me?
I was indeed, sir. How are you?
Quite welI, thank you.
I believe a good night's sleep will cure aII iIIs.
That l took to be the case.
Your performances were,
on the whoIe, promising...
which is more than can be said,
alas, for that of the sliding doors.
One of which might have
thought it was in Japan...
but the other was apparentIy stubbornly
laboring under the misapprehension...
that it was on holiday in Yorkshire.
- Where was the man, Mr. Seymour?
- Rest assured, Mr. Barker...
that tomorrow night
he wiII be with us in Japan.
CapitaI.
Now, cuts. There is onIy one.
In Act 2, the Mikado's song.
-  l beg your pardon, Mr. GiIbert.
- Yes, Miss Brandram.
Surely you can't mean
Mr. Temple's solo?
That is exactIy what l mean.
- l do think that's a shame, sir.
- It's a dreadful shame.
Hear, hear.
My -- My dear Mr. GiIbert.
Temple.
I'm fulIy aware that the standard
of my singing was not quite up to the mark.
Your singing was exemplary, TempIe.
But l can assure you, that once
I have mastered the Ieg business...
I shaIl most certainly be at liberty
to serve the Iyric.
l do apoIogize, Temple.
I've not made myself clear.
My decision to cut the song in no way
refIects upon your performance of it...
- which was fine in every respect.
-  Hear, hear.
The fault, if there is one,
lies in my obtuse decision...
to write the thing in the first pIace.
I have nothing more to say.
Thank you very much. SuIIivan.
Excuse me.
Ladies and gentIemen, uh, if l might presume
to take a few more moments of your time.
I should Iike to thank you aII
most passionately...
for your tremendous hard work
and application during these last few weeks.
And if I may say so...
the contribution of the chorus
was particularly fine.
-  Hear, hear.
- l'm immensely proud of you aII.
I do not wish to tempt the Fates...
but I feel that we wiIl have
a great success.
I have nothing further to add.
Mmm. Only remember --
voce, voce, voce.
- Buonanotte a tutti.
-
Now then, young feIIer-me-Iads.
On the whoIe, the Terpsichore
was executed very "magnifiqueIy"...
notwithstanding the, uh, topsy-turvydom
befuddIing Mr. Ko-Ko's entrance.
Otherwise --
Fans out on "sea," not in.
Bonsoir.
ShouId any gent require a libation...
I shalI be shortIy Iocated at the CoaI HoIe
with Mr. Johnnie WaIker.
-
-  Thank you, Johnny.
Excellent. Bravissimi.
A splendid achievement.
Be confident, and may you have
a good night's rest.
Miss Lenoir.
My thanks and congratulations to you aII.
Now, to hasten you to your slumbers,
cabs have been ordered...
and will meet you at the stage door
as soon as you are ready.
Thank you.
Yes. PIease share a cab with a neighbor.
Remember, we are not made of money.
Thank you, ladies and gentIemen.
- l felt so terribIe.
- Oh, so did I.
My heart broke for him.
I can't bear to see a man cry.
- Was he crying?
-  He was crushed.
- RealIy sad.
- And he's so awfuIIy funny.
There's people who onIy come
to see Mr. Temple perform.
I agree.
My cousins are always asking about him.
They've aIready purchased their tickets.
They'll want their money back now.
There are other people in this piece,
apart from Mr. Temple, don't you know.
Yes. WelI, he's hardIy in it now,
though, is he, Rose?
- He's pIaying the Mikado.
- Thank you, Violet.
Oh, come aIong, EIIen. Be quick.
- WiII you be Iong, Catherine?
- No, I shan't.
- l wish there was something we could do.
- WeII, there ain't.
Mr. GiIbert's made his decision,
and that's that.
With Mr. Gilbert, one never reaIly knows.
ParticularIy before a first night.
I suggest we all go home
and get a good night's sleep.
AbsoluteIy. l'm certainIy off.
l think you shouId aIl button your Iips
and mind your own business. Good night!
-
- Thoroughly uncaIled for.
Good night, girIs.
I don't want to be late for supper.
- Good night, Bunny.
- Bunny, you Iook charming.
- lt's a fine comic song.
- lt is.
- He sings it spIendidly.
- He does.
And do you not conceive, gentIemen,
that the paying audience deserves to hear it?
- l agree, WaIter. They do.
- Rotten luck for poor oId TempIe.
I'm not convinced
it's as immortaI a song as aII that.
Nobody said the song was immortaI, Mr. Lewis.
You were discussing it
as though it were the HoIy GraiI.
Notwithstanding your reservations
about the song, Lewis...
you must concede
that it is a highly originaI performance.
He'd have done better
to cut one of Grossmith's songs.
Mr. Grossmith is a Iittle poorly, Mr. Lewis.
- Then he shouId have stayed at home.
- l think it's a misjudgment.
- It is.
- Someone shouId teII him.
- TeII who?
- GiIbert.
-
- He's only a man Iike the rest of us.
He's not the devil incarnate.
l don't know about you,
but he fair scares the Iiving daylight out of me.
- What about us?
-  Beg pardon, Price?
- Why can't we speak to Mr. Gilbert?
-
We couId all go together.
There's no reason why we shouIdn't.
Is there?
TeIl a man you admire his Iyrics,
he can onIy be gratified.
It's a splendid notion, Mr. Price.
-  WeII, gentlemen, here's food for thought.
-  Indeed, Mr. Evans.
GentIemen, I have been a chorister
in this company for 28 seasons.
It is my intention to remain one
for at Ieast another 28.
-  I'm sure you shaII.
- Be very careful, Mr. Price.
You must consider yourself and your position.
This is tantamount to professionaI suicide.
-
-  That is a little excessive.
Gentlemen, Iet us repair
to the Coal HoIe in the Strand.
-  Don't be Iong, chaps.
-
l'd better go.
Good night, gentIemen.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Take heart, old chum.
- You're going to be wonderfuI.
- Quite so, Dickie.
-  lndeed.
Och, aye.
-  Is that not right, wee Durward?
- Ah, he'II be grand, HeIen.
This has taken us alI quite by surprise.
Mmm. And we all know Mr. GiIbert.
I should have thought
it was a fine song.
- lt is a fine song.
- Mmm.
Thank you.
ls there anything
we can arrange for you, Mr. TempIe?
Hmm?
No, thank you, Miss Lenoir.
l'II be fine.
- WelI, it's very Iate.
- Congratulations, Lely.
- First-cIass.
- Ah, no.
- Did you think so?
- Oh, yes!
- Better and better.
- Thank you.
Grazie, grazie.
- The Beefsteak?
- I'm ravenous.
- Gentlemen, good night.
- Good night, Helen.
-  Good night, Butt.
- Good night, sir.
Dickie, courage.
WeIl, there you have it, Dickie.
He's an absolute bastard.
I knew something of this order
was going to happen.
I sensed it. I told you so.
It reaIly is unconscionabIy crueI.
You've missed your last train, Dickie.
It's too Iate to telegraph
to Mrs. Temple now.
What'Il you do?
Oh, I suppose l shaII toddle
across the river to my mother's.
She never sleeps.
"There's g'aye few like us...
and they're aIl dead."
My father used to say that.
Laughter.
Tears.
Curtain.
- Good afternoon, BoviIl, Miss Langton-James.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Gilbert.
- Good afternoon, Mr. GiIbert.
- Good afternoon, Miss RusseII.
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.
Good afternoon. Gentlemen. Rhys.
Good heavens.
- Afternoon, Mr. GiIbert.
- Afternoon, Price.
Might you spare us a moment
of your time, pIease?
Of course. That's why we're here.
We're about to rehearse.
- Please, Mr. GiIbert, sir.
- Yes, Price. What is it?
- We, uh --
- Hmm?
The Iadies and gentIemen of the chorus --
-
- Yes?
Concerning Mr. TempIe's song, sir.
Ah. The Mikado's song.
Yes, sir.
And what of that mercifuIIy reIeased aberration?
- We alI consider it a very fine song, sir.
- Indeed we do.
Gratifying, I'm sure.
But that must be a matter of opinion,
mustn't it, Price?
WeIl, yes, Mr. Gilbert, but --
- We believe it a great Ioss.
- Terrible Ioss.
- Do you?
-  Yes, sir.
We do, sir.
EspeciaIly after alI
our extremeIy hard work...
and, of course, Mr. TempIe.
I'm reaIly very sorry for you,
but, as we alI know, it's an unjust worId.
We aIl feeI it would have been
of great benefit to the opera.
And that perhaps it shouId be
a matter for the audience to decide.
- ls this the considered opinion of you aII?
-  It is, sir.
- l am not party to this, Mr. GiIbert.
- Ah, Mr. Kent.
As ever, the soIe voice of reason.
Temple, what do you make
of this, uh, occurrence?
I do beg your pardon, Mr. Gilbert...
but I have absoIuteIy no idea
what is taking place.
There's been a request
that your song be reinstated.
Ah.
A most forceful request,
l have to say.
Afternoon. Afternoon.
Do clear the way.
Oh. Beg pardon, sir.
This is surprising indeed,
ladies and gentlemen.
Somewhat overwhelming.
TempIe, wilI you be prepared to sing
the song at this evening's performance?
Yes, sir. l wouId.
Then please be so good as to do so.
- Hip, hip --
-
RehearsaIs wiIl commence in five minutes.
Seymour, where's D'Auban?
- CongratuIations, TempIe.
- Thank you.
-
- Eh?
Right you are, Pidgeon.
Come along! Make haste.
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me, sir, it's 7:00, sir.
There you are, WiIIie.
WilIie? WilIie!
The carriage is waiting, sir.
Sir?
- Out of my way, Pidgeon!
- I do apoIogize, sir.
WilIie! We must be leaving.
We don't want to be Iate.
- You Iook beautiful, madam.
- Oh, thank you, Mrs. Judd.
- lt's most pleasant to be appreciated.
- Don't worry, madam.
-
-
- Good evening, Cook.
- Evening, sir.
-
-  Come in.
-  G.G.
- Arthur.
- Your very good health.
- Yours too, Arthur. SpIendid piece.
Τhank you.
We shaIl both be splendid tonight.
Too many words.
- l thought I'd just pop in.
- Much appreciated.
So very frightened of losing --
One had to stay by the door,
don't you know.
Beg your pardon?
Fifty pounds per week
isn't too much to ask.
Behaves more like a man
than a woman.
G.G., try to remember to breathe properly.
Yes, yes, yes.
This year. Next year.
Too much noise.
George, shaIl we fetch you a doctor?
I know doctors.
Coming in here,
picking and fussing over one.
Magnetizing the chiIdren.
We shalI have a great triumph, you know.
What is the time, by the way?
- A quarter past.
-
The dreaded hour approaches.
Now. Take a deep breath.
And again.
Very good.
-  Who is it?
- Gilbert.
- Oh, do come in.
-  Come in, Mr. Gilbert.
- A brief intrusion.
- How are you, Mr. Gilbert?
As weII as any condemned man can expect.
How are you ladies?
A Iittle anxious, Mr. Gilbert.
Ah! You have every right to be anxious
under the circumstances.
I don't suppose
you'lI be with us this evening?
lndeed not, Jessie. Why on earth
should l want to consort with the foe?
Oh, but l'm quite sure we shaII
have a great success, Mr. GiIbert.
I wish I possessed your confidence.
WeIl, Jessie, bonne chance.
- Thank you.
- And you, tortoise.
Thank you, Mr. Gilbert.
Very good.
I shall put on my kimono now,
please, Emily.
Oh, very welI, Miss Braham.
- Good evening, Cook.
- Sir.
- ls Mr. Grossmith respectabIe?
- I'm afraid not, sir.
- We'Il return later, George.
- Oh, thank you.
- Good evening.
- Sir. Uh, uh --
-
-  No, Cookie!
- Gilbert.
- Oh, beg pardon, sir.
- May I come in?
- l'm in my birthday suit.
- Ah. Are we not receiving?
- No, sir.
Good Iuck, Grossmith.
And be careful with the sword.
Righto.
-  WaIk, boy!
- Yes, sir.
Permission, Mr. Cook.
Permission withheld, sir. On your way.
Thank you, sir. Good luck, sir.
Five minutes, sir.
-
-
-
-
- Get off.
- Be good. Be good.
- What are you do --
- l'm good. I'm good.
Take your hands off me!
Oh, don't rub your smelI off on me!
- You stinking bitch!
-
Just let me go, you cow!
Oh, you're a Iovely big boy.
- How old are you?
- Don't you touch me!
Who made the world, arsehoIe?
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
Pish. Peep.
Mikado.
-
-
Ah!
- How bad was it?
- UtterIy dreadful.
A joke! l jest!
- And Grossmith?
- A Iamentable spectacIe.
- Mmm.
- Are you ready, GiIbert?
Ready for what -- the gibbet?
And fuIl company.
Now, from the middIe, bow.
Thank you very much.
Bravo! Bravo!
There's something inherently
disappointing about success.
Climax and anticIimax, WilIie.
I don't quite know how to take praise.
It makes my eyes red.
It must be rather pleasant
to receive it nonetheless.
I suppose so,
if one feeIs one deserves it.
I don't think anyone would deny
that you deserve it, WilIie.
I know my Iimitations.
I shouId rather Iike to be an actor
upon the stage.
- An actor?
- Yes.
Wouldn't it be wondrous
if perfectly commonpIace peopIe...
gave each other a round of appIause
at the end of the day?
WeIl done, Kitty! WeIl done.
-
- WeII done, Kitty! Bravo. Encore.
Thank you, WiIIie.
- WeIl, you must be tired.
- Must l?
- l shaIl leave you to your beauty sIeep.
- No, don't go.
Any thoughts racing round
in that old brain of yours?
Thoughts of what nature?
Concerning your next piece.
Ah! That monster.
No, not as yet.
Perhaps you should do something compIetely
and utterly different and unusuaI.
- Such as what?
- Oh, weII, I don't know.
- Come along, suggest something.
- Oh.
WeII --
You shouId have
a young and beautiful heroine.
Mmm.
Who grows old and pIain.
As she graduaIIy
becomes older and oIder...
the Iadies' chorus
becomes younger and younger.
Ah. Topsy-turvy.
Yes.
And how wouId it commence,
this comic opera of yours?
With the gentIemen's chorus, of course.
A chorus of fat Ieeches.
- Leeches?
- Yes.
No, they'd be gentlemen,
and they'd be in their carriages...
and they'd be rushing across the stage.
The horses wouId be galIoping
across the stage...
and the Iadies wouId be chasing after them,
endeavoring to talk to them.
But they wouIdn't be Iistening.
They'd aII be far too busy.
Mmm. Expensive to stage.
And there'd be dozens of doors
and ticking cIocks on the stage.
And he's made a vow to give her the key,
but he never does.
And who might "he" be?
WeIl, he's her husband, I suppose.
The hero.
No, not the hero.
Anyway, one day --
No. Late one night...
she suddenIy decides to try the door.
And it opens.
Ah, so it wasn't Iocked after aII.
And she climbs up the stairs...
and there, on the sands,
are hundreds of nannies...
alI pushing empty perambuIators about.
And every time she tries to be born...
he strangIes her with her umbiIicaI cord.
Hmm.
I shouldn't imagine SuIlivan
would much care for that.
I'm proud of myseIf...
triumphant, exhilarated...
exhausted, revived...
and fed up to the back teeth
with these wretched kidneys.
Poor oId thing.
Arthur, an oId demon has come back
to haunt us at a most unweIcome time.
What on earth do you mean?
Oh.
I didn't want to teIl you.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
How Iong have you known?
Ten days.
Oh, Fanny.
I shall make the arrangements.
That won't be necessary.
I couldn't go through that again.
I'm sorry that you have to.
I've made my own arrangements.
Have you?
Someone has been recommended to me.
After alI, it is 1 885, Arthur.
I love The Mikado
You've put everything you are into it.
You Iight up the worId.
You can't heIp it.
I must fly.
"Yes, l am indeed beautifuI.
Sometimes l sit and wonder...
in my artIess Japanese way...
why it is that I am
so much more attractive...
than anybody eIse
in the whole worId.
Can this be vanity?
No.
Nature is loveIy...
and rejoices in her IoveIiness.
I am a chiId of Nature...
and take after my mother."
