Ugh. If only I could sleep. If only I knew.
FATHER MOUSE:
Well, I'm
If only I could sleep. If only I knew.
We got trouble, the boss and me.
trouble.
How would you feel if it was
three minutes to Christmas...
...and you didn't know whether?
As we say when
a tall piece of cheddar...
...better start from the top.
The trouble began two months
when the mailman came.
Hey, wait a minute, this isn't for us.
It's for Santa.
- So is this.
- And this.
- And this.
- I spilled that ink.
- These are the letters we wrote to Santa.
- The letters we wrote to Santa, returned?
"Not accepted by addressee."
- What does that mean, Father?
- Santa doesn't want our letters.
- But why?
- I don't know, Sarah. I don't know.
FATHER MOUSE:
FATHER MOUSE:
North Pole substation.
This is Father Mouse in Junctionville.
Am I  through?
The equipment is in  order.
- You'll have to be more specific, sir.
- I'll be specific.
How about these letters that all came back
not even opened?
- You did say Junctionville, sir?
Ooh, that explains it, sir.
Santa didn't like that letter in the
sir. Not one bit.
Letter? What letter? Who wrote it?
I wish I knew. It was signed, "all of us."
Hello.
Back issues,
in the cellar.
MAN: A citizen to see you, Mr. Mayor.
- Citizen?
They're not allowed in here.
This is public property.
This one says he has an answer
to our problem.
Then show him in. Show him in!
Mr. Joshua Trundle, a clockmaker.
TRUNDLE:
Mr. Mayor and honorable councilmen...
...I think we all know what the problem is.
We have concluded that,
for reasons unknown...
...Mr. Claus, Santa, that is...
...has taken an unconscionable attitude
of hostile retaliation toward...
Oh, heck, he's mad at us.
That's just what I think too,
and I want to make him happy again...
...with this.
Very handsome, Mr. Trundle.
But how will a clock make him happy?
It's not an ordinary clock.
At exactly midnight on Christmas Eve,
when Santa is  overhead...
...he'll hear this.
CHILDREN :
Of course, this is only a small model.
With the children singing,
I must make a  one...
for Santa
to see and hear.
- I move to authorize construction at once.
- Second.
All those in favor? And don't you
dare say no, McDavitt.
MEN: Aye.
- Carried.
You may build your clock, Mr. Trundle.
And may the  tones
of its melody...
...soar to the pinnacle
of the celestial heights where...
Oh, heck, get started.
MOTHER MOUSE:
I found it, I found it.
"Dear Editor, Santa Claus
is a fraudulent myth...
...rooted in unconscious fantasies
and  as a deceitful lie."
"P.S. The reindeer are phony too."
MOTHER MOUSE: "Signed, all of us."
- No wonder Santa's angry.
- Who would send him a letter like that?
-  words. It sounds like the mayor.
words.
words.
-  words.
- Oh, no. It couldn't be.
- Albert?
- Yes, Father.
There'swe've
got to talk about.
I said, yes, Father.
- "Yes, Father," what?
- I wrote the letter...
...my friends and I, that is. All of us.
You didn't, Albert.
"Dear Editor, Santa Claus
is a fraudulent myth rooted in..."
Enough. Enough.
Write another one right
away, apologizing.
But I can't.
- Why not?
- That letter was true.
You don't know as much as you think,
because you only think with your head.
So you have a lot of trouble
in  you can't see or touch.
Like, for instance, what things?

CHORUS & FATHER MOUSE:
FATHER MOUSE:
Here's our first example...
...of how you ruined
everyone's Christmas with your opinions.
This children's hospital once knew
laughter, best medicine there is...
...but not anymore.
There's Davey Thomas,
best artist in school.
He made that picture of Santa
when he thought that Santa cared.
These are just kids.
Grownups never believe in Santa.
Don't quite know  do you?
Shh.
Everyone's asleep.
Mr. Trundle's been hard at work
a special clock.
There's the model.
When the clock strikes 12
on Christmas Eve...
...it'll play a  Santa.
Does that sound like a man
who doesn't believe?
A  When the hands
come together like this?
What's the matter with you?
Do you wanna wake everyone up?
Neat. Does it work
on the gear-and-pinion principle...
...or an AC synchronous motor?
Well, it's more of a...
A gear what? Synchronous who?
Ever since Copernicus, Dad,
it was known that...
Never mind. Never...
You may know algebra, son...
...but this time, the whole town's
on this clock.
Fellow citizens...
...we are gathered
on this auspicious occasion...
...to honor a distinguished gentleman...
...whose inspired
and consummate excellence...
...in the craft of chronometric
creation has, uh, ahem...
Oh, heck, he made one whale
of a clock. Mr. Joshua Trundle.
And now, Mr. Trundle, if you will start
your magnificent clock and its song...
...that will make Santa Claus
our friend again.
With pleasure.
FATHER MOUSE:
Please, come back.
I'm still a good clockmaker.
Really, I am.
- What do you want?
- I'm Joshua Trundle.
I've come to fix the clock.
Ain't you fixedthings
enougharound here?
But I made that clock
for the town, for Santa.
It's got to work by Christmas Eve,
and I can make it work. I...
- What seems to be the trouble?
- This joker wants to get in.
- He came to fix the clock.
- Is that what he says?
Well, let me tell you  Trundle.
Of all the incompetent, insolent purveyors
of chicanery that I have ever...
Oh, heck,  home.
FATHER MOUSE:
- No sense in  stockings, Dad.
- There's no one to fill them this year...
...unless you believe in miracles.
Now, don't  that.
The night's not over yet. There's...
There's always hope.
Miracles happen most every day.
BOTH:
MOTHER MOUSE:
Come, children, it's time for bed.
- What is it?
- It's my fault. All my fault.
- I've ruined everyone's Christmas.
- I know you wrote the letter, Albert.
You told us so, and that was honest of you.
But as you said, it was your opinion.
ALBERT:
No, that isn't it.  else.
FATHER MOUSE: What else?
- Mr. Trundle's clock...
...in the  hall.
I wanted to see how it worked...
...so I climbed up into it and...
- Kerplunk.
- Kerplooey.
- You broke the clock?
- I didn't mean it, Father.
I'm sorry. So sorry.
It's not enough. When you've done
wrong...
...you have to correct the  you did.
That's it. I'll fix it, Father.
I'll fix the clock by midnight.
- Then maybe Santa will...
- You believe in Santa?
I don't know. I don't know. But I've
learned that I still got a lot to learn.
But, son, you don't know
how to fix a clock.
That's all right, Father. Copernicus knew.
Good luck.
Psst.
- Father Mouse?
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Trundle.
- Not very merry, I'm afraid.
- You're right, of course.
And it's my fault, my family's.
- How so?
- My older boy, Albert.
First, he insulted Santa, and then...
- I can hardly say it.
- Go on.
I'm afraid he got into your clock
to see how it worked, and then...
- Kerplunk.
- Kerplooey.
So that was it.
The boy has repented.
He's  to make amends right now.
