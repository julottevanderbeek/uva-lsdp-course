NARRATOR: And it came to pass
that there went out
a decree from Caesar Augustus
that all the world
should be taxed,
and all went to be taxed,
everyone, to his own city,
for to disobey the Roman emperor
meant certain death.
Oh, there were young people
and old people.
There were the famous
and mighty,
and some not yet known,
but whose names would
eventually linger
and be revered for all time.
There were good people
who could ill afford
the cruel tax about
to be imposed upon them,
and there were others.
And there were others.
Observe, Ali, the little
drummer boy Aaron.
Are those animals
dancing, Ben haramed?
BEN: They certainly are.
Faster, old friends. Faster.
You, samson, smile.
Hee-haw!
And you, bimbaba,
be lighter, happier.
Baa!
Baa!
Oh, Joshua, you can do better.
Oh, with this marvel
in my show caravan,
I will be as rich as Solomon.
But it is said
Aaron dislikes all humans.
He will not join us willingly.
BEN: Fool! Why do you think
we brought the rope?
Ah!
Ah!
Let me go! Do you hear me!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Get the camel!
Get the camel!
BEN: Ah! The donkey, too, fool!
BEN: Ah! The donkey, too, fool!
The lamb, you oaf!
Grab the lamb!
How? I have only two hands!
Stop concerning yourself
with details!
Do it!
Do it!
Drummer boy,
you may not believe me,
but this is the luckiest
day of your life.
But this is the luckiest
day of your life.
CHORUS:  come, they told me
Pa rum pum pum pum
Our newborn king to see
Pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts to bring
Pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the king
Pa rum pum pum pum,
rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
So to honor him
Pa rum pum pum pum
When we come
When we come
NARRATOR: The little
drummer boy Aaron
fought Ben haramed and Ali
with all his might.
He most definitely did not want
to join the showman's caravan,
a journey into the crowded city,
FOR IT WAS TRUE:
Aaron hated people...
All people.
No! No! I won't go with you!
Stop struggling, boy!
There is money to be made.
We can be rich!
While those taxpayers are
waiting to be counted,
they will grow bored.
They will crave the
entertainment which only I...
Ben haramed, king of
the desert showmen...
and of course you,
too, can provide.
But I do not want to
go near that mob.
I hate people! All people!
Do you think ilovepeople?
What a beautiful world
it would be without people.
But, alas, one must
exist with people.
And indeed, it is better
to be crowded and rich...
Than crowded... And poor.
Than crowded... And poor.
When the day is good
and the wind is dry
And the goose
is hanging high
I can't work
like other men do
When the goose
is hanging high
When the sun is bright
in the big blue sky
And the goose
is hanging high
The devil steals
my heart away
When the goose
is hanging high
Gold and silver on my mind
Mischief in my soul
I want to live
like a rich man lives
With life in my control
When the day is bad
and the wind is wet
and the goose is flying low
I've got to work
like other men do
when is goose is flying low
But... When... The...
Day is good
and the wind is dry
And the goose
is hanging high
I can't work
like other men do
When the goose
is hanging high
When the goose
is hanging high!
When the goose
is hanging high!
NARRATOR: Oh, Ben haramed
was a wily old desert jackal.
Only he could have talked Aaron
into visiting the crowded city.
For you see, Aaron truly
did hate all people.
Now, it wasn't always this way,
for Aaron was once
a happy farm lad,
the son of a Shepherd.
Father! Mother!
Father! Mother!
And why this exceptional
greeting today, my son?
Oh, no reason.
Happy Birthday, Aaron.
Oh, father! Mother!
Did you bring me something?
I don't suppose...
This would interest you,
young man?
A drum!
My very own drum! Oh, father!
Try it out, Aaron!
NARRATOR: And perhaps because
it was a gift of love,
the drum had an almost
magical quality.
And the animals, when they heard
it, began to dance to its sound.
And the animals, when they heard
it, began to dance to its sound.
But Aaron's happiness
was to end all too soon,
for one night,
bandits of the desert attacked.
For one night,
bandits of the desert attacked.
What's going on out there?
Father!
You must run, my son. Escape!
But... run!
But... run!
NARRATOR: They burned the farm
and took the sheep,
and Aaron's happy life
had changed forever.
And so, Aaron roamed the land
a lonely orphan,
his only friends 3 of the farm
animals who had escaped.
He vowed to hate all humans
for what they had done
to his family,
and he kept that vow.
And he kept that vow.
BEN: Ah, Jerusalem at last.
Here we shall make our fortune.
AARON: All these people!
Aha! The rest of
my show caravan.
Hello! Hello!
Jameel and mesaal!
Jameel and mesaal!
Set up our performing carpets,
and let us be on with the show.
And let us be on with the show.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Fellow taxpayers!
The day need not be all gloomy.
For I, Ben haramed,
king of the desert showmen,
have brought at great expense
direct from the palace
of the emperor of China,
the toast of royalty,
mesaal and jameel,
tumblers extraordinary!
Hup! Hup!
Hup! Hup!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Perhaps you will show
your appreciation
for such a performance.
For such a performance.
Philistine!
And now, let's
move it right along
with Ali of Arabia,
greatest juggler
under the stars.
Greatest juggler
under the stars.
Boy, you perform next.
The crowd is restless.
You must appease them.
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
No, no. Smile. Smile!
See, only a smile
pleases the crowd.
Smile. Smile!
I cannot.
Not at... Them.
You stubborn little fool!
Then wear a painted one.
There. That's better.
When do I go on?
Now, before the dope juggles me
out of my life savings!
Now, before the dope juggles me
out of my life savings!
you never heard a lion laugh
you never saw a gator grin
A goose in a gaggle
never gives a giggle
why can't the animals smile?
you never saw a smiling frog
a tickled lamb, a happy hog
A lighthearted camel,
a merry old mammal
why can't the animals smile?
A barrel of monkeys,
a pack of silly donkeys
An elephant, a caribou
Have never been heard
to chuckle a word
Or Twitter like people do
You never heard
a mouse guffaw
A crow that did
much more than caw
Is an eagle too regal,
or is it all illegal?
why can't the animals smile?
Why can't
the animals smile?
Why can't
the animals smile?
More! More!
More! More!
You heard them! More! More!
Don't let them get away
before I pass the hat!
NARRATOR: But as Aaron looked at
the faces of the cheering mob,
a great rage rose up inside him.
How dare they laugh and be happy
after what their kind
did to his family!
Stop! Quiet!
I hate you all for what you did!
You're all preying
thieves and bandits
and knaves and...
and knaves and...
run for it!
NARRATOR: And so,
the troupe was chased
out of Jerusalem by the mob.
BEN: Boy, you shall pay
for this indignity.
Ben haramed! Look!
Ben haramed! Look!
BEN: By the hounds of heaven,
it is the caravan...
Of a king! We're in luck!
Can I believe my luck?
Two kings!
Hold me up! Three!
Three kings!
Three kings!
NARRATOR: And behold, there came
wise men from the east,
three kings of the orient,
and lo, the star which they saw
went before them.
Went before them.
Yes, it was the star
of Bethlehem
which shone so brightly
and graced the lonely darkening
desert with its silver light.
But the little troupe did not
see the star's beauty,
for the souls of Ben haramed and
Ali were too filled with greed
and the heart of Aaron
too overflowing with hatred
to take any note of
the wonder just above them.
Now you listen, drummer boy.
If you give this
one performance,
half the money shall be yours.
Then you are free.
NARRATOR: Aaron agreed,
only because he knew
that with the kings' money,
he would be free
to go his own way
and never again have to
trouble himself with humans.
AND SO THEY APPROACHED
THE THREE KINGS:
Melchior, caspar, and balthazar.
'Tis night. We must break camp.
And swiftly!
The star waits not for us.
Strike the tents!
Pack the camels!
Strike the tents!
Pack the camels!
No! Don't go!
We just got here!
Halt! Out of my way!
We must perform!
Down, knave! Down!
Ben haramed... A knave?
Ben haramed... A knave?
I am crushed.
Lower your Spears.
These desert vagabonds
seem to mean us no harm.
Why do you come to us?
We are a troupe of players,
your majesty...
uh, majesties.
We have no time for
making merry, as you see.
We break camp, and...
well, that's ridiculous.
Begging your pardon.
Nobody travels
the desert by night!
We do...
For we follow the star.
For we follow the star.
BEN: How very... Convenient.
But, uh...
Enough.
Begone.
Now, to resume our journey.
Now, to resume our journey.
So close.
My fortune was so close!
And see what they load
on the camels,
great one.
Gold!
Oh, it's too painful.
AND MORE VALUABLE
EVEN THAN GOLD:
The precious eastern resins
frankincense and myrrh.
Frankincense and myrrh.
She is too weak to
go on, your majesties.
Poor creature.
She has been weakened
by the long journey.
Have we no extra beasts?
All are laden,
almost beyond their strength.
MELCHIOR: Wait!
Did that player not own a camel?
Perhaps he would sell it.
No!
No!
You strike a hard
bargain, player.
I've had a hard life.
CASPAR: Now load the beast,
and let us be on our way.
And let us be on our way.
Gold. Ah.
I adore the feel of it,
the weight of it,
the look of it.
Ahh.
Ahh.
Your share.
I don't want it!
I don't want any part of you!
Come, samson, baba.
We must find our old comrade.
No!
BEN: Let him go!
We're done with him!
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!
NARRATOR: Aaron climbed
the tallest hill he could find,
but the royal caravan
was nowhere in sight.
But the royal caravan
was nowhere in sight.
Baa!
What is it, baba?
Samson?
Samson?
The star?
Yes.
The kings were
following that star.
If we follow it,
we are sure to
catch up with them.
Come, quickly!
NARRATOR: And so they
followed the gleaming star,
little realizing where
it was leading them.
CHORUS:
you can hear the music
If you listen
with your heart
One star in the night
Shone on Bethlehem...
AARON: The town of Bethlehem.
NARRATOR: And as Aaron glanced
back out over the countryside,
he saw what seemed to be
a gentle army of poor Shepherds,
all of them being led
toward the tiny town.
Why... They're all
following the same star.
Why... They're all
following the same star.
One star in the night
Look, samson! Baba!
By that old stable up ahead.
See?
The royal caravan!
We found it!
See, there is old Joshua!
Joshua!
NARRATOR: Their hearts
were so full of joy
that they did not look
where they were going.
Suddenly, something came
careening out of the darkness.
DRIVER: Out of my way,
ragamuffin!
Baba!
Baba!
Oh, baba, you mustn't
die! You mustn't!
Who could help me?
Who could help me?
Yes. The kings.
The kings are wise.
They will be able to save baba.
They will be able to save baba.
Please, I've got to get
inside to see the kings!
You must let me through!
NARRATOR: And when Aaron came
to the entrance of the stable,
he could hardly believe
what he saw.
He could hardly believe
what he saw.
And she brought forth
her firstborn son
and wrapped him
in swaddling clothes
and laid him in a manger
because there was no room
for them in the inn.
Oh, your majesty!
You must... shh.
You must... shh.
Oh. The player boy.
My lamb has been injured.
You must save him.
He is near death.
Oh, lad, there is
nothing I can do.
But... But you're a king!
A mortal king only.
But... There is
a king among kings
who would save
your little friend.
The babe?
But I do not understand.
CASPAR: It is not necessary
that you understand. Go to him.
But... I...
I have no gift to bring.
Go. Look upon the newborn king.
Baby jesu
Pa rum pum pum pum
I am a poor boy too
Pa rum pum pum pum
I have no gift to bring
Pa rum pum pum pum
that's fit to give our king
Pa rum pum pum pum,
rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Shall I play for you
Pa rum pum pum pum
On my drum
On my drum
Mary nodded
Pa rum pum pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time
Pa rum pum pum pum
I played my drum for him
pa rum pum pum pum
I played my best for him
pa rum pum pum pum,
rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Then he smiled at me
Pa rum pum pum pum
Me and my drum
NARRATOR: And as Aaron
looked at the babe,
he thought it was
the most beautiful sight
he had ever seen.
AARON: And yet, there is
something more about him...
So much more.
Your gift, little drummer boy,
given out of the
simple desperation
of a pure love,
is the one favored above all.
See?
NARRATOR: Aaron's heart
was filled with joy and love,
and he knew at last
that the hate he had
carried there was wrong,
as all hatred
will ever be wrong.
For more powerful,
more beautiful by far
than all the eons of sadness
and cruelty and desolation
which have come before
was that one tiny, crystalline
second of laughter.
Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God.
For they shall see God.
