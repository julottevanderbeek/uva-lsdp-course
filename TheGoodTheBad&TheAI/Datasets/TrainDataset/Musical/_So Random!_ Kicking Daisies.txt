Welcome back to magical student week on Wheel of Fortune!
If you're just joining us, our
magical student contestants are...
From Hogwarts academy, student Harry Potter.
Gryffindor, Gryffindor,
You're the house I'm playing for!
Go Hogwarts, yay!
Neat.
Also playing for
middle earth middle school...
Who not only share the same rock,
But also share the same naked,
relatively hairless body.
I'm smeagol.
I love the "wheel-ses"
Almost as much as my precious.
And I'm gollum,
And I'd rather be on
"minute-ses
to win it-ses."
Finally, playing for forks high,
It's Bella and Jacob.
I'm playing for Bella.
I'm playing for Bella.
It's like I'm watching one
of the "twilight" movies,
Except I'm awake.
This one, Harry, he's a
right lord of the zings.
Right? Right? Oh!
All right, on the board we have...
I'd like to try to solve the puzzle.
As a wizard, I'm quite good at spelling.
Get it?
"spell-ing." right?
You may be the boy who lived, Harry,
But that was the joke that died.
Oh, snap-seses!
Up top!
The phrase is "the wizards oo waverly place."
Nope. All the os
are up there, Harry.
That's how we play the game.
Looks like a big break for the
naked brothers from middle earth.
I wants to solveses it for the preciouses.
No!
I'll solve.
- Yes.
- "...Waverly..."
- Here it comes.
- ...Precious.
And there it goes.
Bella, the door is wide open.
She's mine.
Edward... wow.
Up close, you are sparkly.
And a mint wouldn't kill you.
Nothing can kill me.
Pass.
Don't really have passes in this game,
But all right.
Harry, back to you.
Pass!
Seriously? Okay.
Gollum, take us home.
Pass-eses.
There is no passes in this game, guys.
The letter is "f."
Jacob, just say "f."
I'm gonna spin.
What?
I mean pass.
gonna pass.
Why do you have to whoosh?
- Yes, but...
- Wait, I solved it!
"the wizards
oo waverly place."
- I got something to say.
- Yes.
That's it.
Why would you take off
your shirt for no reason?
Why would you?
That makes no sense.
Where's my shirt?
And where's
your pants-eses?
Okay, that's it.
Magical student week is over.
Whoosh!

Stop the music.
What? Why?
- What's going on?
- Well, I got a little surprise.
Been working on a new version
of the "so random!" theme song.
New version?
You know I sang that, right?
Yeah, we all know that.
Anyway, who wants to hear my version of it?
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
So what is it,
Like a country song?
One word.
Just wait for it, wait.

theme song better. .
Hit it!
it's
a party,
a fantastic journey, a
little bit of this and that
you know we gonna chill,
might not come back
so if you're ready,
get set...
'sup, class?
I'm your new teach.
Mr. Goodman.
- Good morning, Mr. Goodman.
- Whoa!
Whoa whoa whoa!
No need to "good morning,
Mr. Goodman" me.
Did you notice my funky duds
and my head kerchief?
I clearly don't play by the rules.
That's right.
Soak it up. Popcorn!
Forget everything you thought
you knew about teachers, kids,
'cause I'm the exact opposite.
So I bet right about now.
A boring old normal teacher.
Would have you open your
books to chapter 1, huh?
Chapter 1?
Not me, no.
I'm gonna have you close your books.
To chapter negative 1.
wiki wiki wiki what? .
But, Mr. Goodman, how do we close our
books to a chapter that doesn't exist?
Yeah, how do we do that?
I don't know.
Don't ask me.
- I don't play by the rules.
Turkey Turkey! - Whoa!
Yeah! All right! Whoo!
That's right. I know what
you're thinking, kids.
When's this cool teach sporting wheel shoes.
Gonna play this guitar?
Am I right?
Actually, we're just wondering
when we're gonna learn something.
Right about now, Holmes broseph.
Mixed nuts!
You just learned that
I don't play the guitar.
By the rules. I got wheels in my shoes.
That's how I roll.
All right, Mr.
Goodman going around the world.
Low fives, everybody.
All right! Yeah, whoa!
I'm cool.
I'm cool.
- Kids, I'm cool. I'm cool.
- Mr. Goodman, are you...
Easy, kid.
You don't need to raise your
hand to ask a question in here.
That's right.
You got a question,
You don't raise your hand.
You lower your foot.
But how are you gonna know
if we're lowering our feet.
If they're already touching the floor?
I don't know. Don't ask me.
I've got an ear piercing.
Hawaiian pizza! Oh!
Check that out,
that's gross! Eww!
Oh, that hurt!
A boring old normal teacher
would have regretted that,
But not me, 'cause I
don't play by the rules.
So I'm gonna go home and blog
about how much I enjoyed it.
All right!
Mr. Goodman,
I have a question.
Well, I can't hear you.
Because one: I've got a bit
of an ear situation going on,
B: You raised your hand,
And p.S.: Everybody,
Mr. Goodman.
Is a boring old normal teacher name.
Boo hoo hoo hoo!
You'll all
call me Mrs. Bad woman.
Soy sauce!
Ow! Worth it.
Totally worth it.
Ahh!
A normal teacher wouldn't
have karate chopped.
His desk in half right about now,
So I had to karate chop my desk in half.
My wrist hurts pretty bad right now,
My knee is starting to swell,
And this ear is gonna need a stitch.
A normal teacher would probably
have the school nurse check it out,
No, I'm gonna have a janitor ignore it.
thank you for the tip
for you we do a flip
put that in a jar
with that,
we will go far.
what does it take
to get you?
Thank you.
Welcome to chilly slab!
What can we get for you?
My little Carrie here got straight as,
And the deal was she could
get anything she wants.
Before we meet her friends at the movies.
What'll you have?
I'll take a vanilla double-mega-jumbo
gotta-have-it size.
What ploppings would you like?
- Nummy bears and candy corn...
- Can do.
...And Graham crackers,
chocolate sprinkles,
More candy corn and hummus.
Ooh, one #2 plopped right up for you.
That'll be $5.
$5 and here is a tip.
A tip?!
-  thank you!
-  Thank you!
thank you! .
Well, you're very welcome.
It's just a dollar.
-  thank you!
-  Thank you!
thank you,
thank you! .
Look, you know, it was just a tip.
You don't have to get too excited over it.
thank you for the tip
for you we do a flip
put that in a jar
with that,
we will go far. .
They sang, daddy.
Yes, they sure did.
Hey, can we get that ice cream to go?
we're not done just yet
-  the thanks you're gonna get...
- You really don't have to.
this is our ice cream song
we invite you
to sing along... .
Sweetie, aren't we gonna
be late for the movie?
I'm sure they're almost done, daddy.
Okay, all right.
tipping was invented in 1693
you just did it at chilly slab creamery
historically tips are stored in a jar
or they can be placed
in a dish on the bar
tip wave, tip wave,
t-t-tip wave... .
All right, that's enough.
Come on, honey, they have
ice cream at the movies.
But, daddy, this is the only place
that offers hummus as a plopping.
And I'm not leaving till I get it!
Fine. I only gave
them a dollar.
They can't go... they can't
go on that much longer.
well, that was 5Â¢ of thanks, you know
there's another 95 to go
you were kind to leave money in the jar
we may be singing,
but you're the real star
you're a star! .
Okay, we're leaving.
Let's just...
Look, I've got a report
card with straight as.
That says I'm not going anywhere
until I get my #2, old man.
Old man? Huh!
Ooh!
we said thank you, we said thank
you, we said thank you, thank you
we said thank you, we said thank you
we said thank you, thank you
-  we said thank you, we said thank you...

We'll have that ice cream
in two seconds for you.
Finally.
See? I get my #2 and we're
still gonna make the movie.
Sorry, I was here before,
but I forgot to leave a tip.

Look at these strappy high
heels Megan fox is wearing.
They make her look 6' tall.
And look at this pair of heels
Steven Tyler is wearing.
They make him look 5' tall.
I wish  mom would let
buy fancy high heels.
have all the
fancy
I'd say you better not get our hopes up.
We've been burned by announcers before.
Ice heels, huh?
Tell us more.
and
in just 8 to 10
Check it out.
The cold shoes turned my toes blue,
So now they match your lips.
We look awesome.
It's Megan fox and Steven Tyler.
We're wearing heels just like you.
These 8" ice heels.
Make me feel like a Norwegian supermodel.
Wait. Either I'm shrinking
or these shoes are melting,
And we got burned again
by another announcer.
What are you doing up here, huh?
The floor is soaked.
There's water dripping through the ceiling.
And where did you buy those stupid...
...Right now!
...You!
fun is coming right up.
what does it take
what does it take
what does it take
to get you?
Get them off me!
Give it up for Dave days!
I woke up in the middle of the night
out of luck with this girl on my mind
she got away now
I'm trying to explain how
I fell in love,
that's what I like to call it
but not enough, it's like I
never saw it drifting away
I am finding words to say
but it all goes...
what does it take
to get you?
if I never met you
I wouldn't have ran across the country
like I'm out of my mind
what does it take
to hold you?
when I'm here without you
I don't know where to start
I gotta find you and your heart
before it falls apart
we fell in love,
but didn't try to say it
knew what it was
the moment that we played it
we all lose sometimes
I can't get her off my
mind, I can't get her
what does it take
I'm finding words to say
but it all goes
what does it take
to get you?
if I never met you
I wouldn't have ran across the country
like I'm out of my mind
what does it take
to hold you?
when I'm here without you
I don't know where to start
I gotta find you and your heart
before it falls apart
what does it take
to make it real?
the world still spins
and I'm still feeling
your hand right next to mine
I play it back a thousand times
I wish I took a photograph
for every moment that we laughed
hung up, I can't relax
because she's so far away
what does it take
to get you?
what does it take
to get you?
what does it take
to get you?
if I never met you
I wouldn't have ran across the country
like I'm out of my mind
what does it take
to hold you?
when I'm here without you
I don't know where to start
I gotta find you and your heart
before it falls apart
I'm finding words to say
before it falls apart
yeah yeah!
before it falls apart. .
Give it up for Dave days!
