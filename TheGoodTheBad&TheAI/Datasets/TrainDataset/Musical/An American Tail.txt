Tanya, Fievel...
will you stop that
twirling, twirling?
That's it.
I mean it.
But, Mama,
it's Hannukah!
For you, every night
is Hannukah.
Papa,
enough already.
They'll never
get to sleep.
All right.
All right.
Presents.
What about presents?
Presents?
What presents?
Oh, Papa.
Just a joke.
For Tanya,
a new babushka.
Happy Hannukah.
Oh, Papa.
Thank you.
You have
only one parent?
Thank you, Mama.
And for you, Fievel,
a new hat.
A hat that has
been in the family...
for three generations.
It belonged to me,
my father,
and my father's father,
and now
it belongs to you.
Happy Hannukah.
It's too big.
You'll grow.
Ah, did I ever tell you...
about the giant
mouse of Minsk?
No.
No.
Like the mouse
with long hair...
that the prince
climbed up?
No. This mouse,
the mouse of Minsk,
was tall as a tree.
His tail was
a mile long.
Really?
Really.
He was so big,
he frightened
all the cats.
Don't say that word.
Talk about
something else.
America.
Another fairy tale.
America.
What a place.
What a place.
In America, there are
mouseholes in every wall.
Who says?
Everyone!
Bread crumbs
on every floor!
You're talking
nonsense.
In America,
you can say anything.
But most important,
and this I know,
in America,
there are no cats.
Shh. They'll
hear you.
How could they hear us?
There, you see?
Waa!
The cossacks!
The cossacks!
Don't cry, Yasha.
I'll scare them away.
Fievel, you'll get hurt!
Go away!
Go away, cats!
Go away!
Grrr!
Aah!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Aah!
Fievel, angel,
are you all right?
Yes, Mama.
Then never
do that again!
Mama, look.
In America...
there are no cats.
Look, Papa, water.
Is it the ocean?
Yes. Keep walking.
Look, Papa, smoke.
Is the boat on fire?
No. Keep walking.
Look, Papa, birds!
Are they sea gulls?
Keep walking!
Keep walking!
Keep walking.
Keep walking!
I just wanted to see.
This is the last time
I take you to America.
Bye-bye!
Auf wiedersehen.
Auf wiedersehen.
Auf wiedersehen.
I got a cousin
in America.
You and everybody else.
Are we there yet?
Not yet. Soon.
How soon?
Soon.
Maybe we should have
stayed in Russia.
We'll be all right.
As long as
we're together,
we'll be all right.
Ahh, so, Mr. Curious,
you've discovered
the herring.
Herring?
I thought
they were fish.
But, Fievel,
Herring are fish.
Really?
Certainly. In the ocean,
there are all kinds of fish.
All kinds?
Yes. Tiny fishes,
not so tiny fishes,
fishes as big
as this boat.
Wow!
Let's go up
and see the fish!
Not now.
Your mama's worried.
Come back, Fievel.
Wait!
What am I going
to do with you?
Mama!
Ah, so we return,
hmm?
We saw some fish.
Fish?
Lucky you didn't
see some cats.
Cats!
Cats!
I didn't see any cats.
Whew.
Won't it be nice
to get to America...
where we don't
have to worry.
There are no cats
in America,
but back home
in Mother Russia...
ohh...
# Our family
was traveling #
#Through the snow
to Minsk #
# Suddenly Papa #
# Saw those
huge paw prints #
#When I heard him
screaming #
# I fainted dead away #
#And I woke up
an orphan #
But...
But...
# But there are no cats
in America #
#And the streets
are paved with cheese #
#There are no cats
in America #
# So set your mind
at ease #
If you think things
were bad in Russia,
you should see things
in my country.
#The times were hard
in Sicily #
#We had no provolone #
#The Don, he was a tabby #
#With a taste
for my brother Tony #
#When Mama went
to plead for him #
#The Don said
he would see her #
#We found her rosary
on the ground #
Poor Mama mia.
But...
# But there are no cats
in America #
#And the streets
are paved with cheese #
#There are no cats
in America #
# So set your
mind at ease #
Sure, that's sad,
but sadder still...
#When I was but a lad #
# I lost
my true love fair #
#A calico #
# He caught us
by surprise #
# In a flash
of teeth and fur #
# Her tail was all
he left of her #
# 'Neath the heather #

Hey, fellas,
want a bite?
Oh, it's the end
of the world.
No, it's worse.
Aah!
Hmm.
Aah!
Fievel.
Fievel,
come, sit here.
Yes, Papa.
Fievel.
Fish!
Fievel!
Fievel!
Fievel!
I'm getting
my hat, Papa.
Fievel!
Fievel, come back.
My hat!
Wait!
Fievel, stop!
Stop!
Papa!
Fievel!
Don't move!
Papa!
Grab my hand!
Help!
Grab my hand!
Fievel!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Fievel, come back!
Aah!
Papa, help!
Aah!
Fievel!
Fievel!
Fievel!
Papa!
America.
No, no. New York.
Name?
Smovolodnydhromovichsky.
Ok, Mr... Smith.
Family, Mousekewitz.
How many?
Five...
I mean four.
Ok. Next.
Papa, why did they
change my name to Tilly?
# Give me your tired #
#Your poor #
#Your huddled masses #
#Yearning to breathe free #
#The wretched refuse

# Send these,

#Tempest-tossed, to me #
# I lift my lamp
beside the golden door ##
Ah-choo!
Ah! A little immigrant.
Now they are
coming by bottle.
Uh, where is
your papa...
your mama, eh?
They were on
the boat to America.
Then you are in luck,
my little immigrant.
This is America!
America.
I thought
it was bigger.
Oh, it is bigger.
All of that
is also America.
Wow!
This is just an island
at the doorway...
where I,
Henri Le Pigeon,
am putting up
my Statue of Liberty.
Ah, that's better.
I know,
my little immigrant,
you want to find
your family,
and you will.
But how?
It's so far away,
and it's so big!
I'll never
find them anyway.
but did you say...
never?
So young,
and you have lost hope.
Ah, this is America,
the place to find hope!
If you give up,
you will never
find your family.
So, never...
say...
never.
Say...
# Never say never #
#Whatever you do #
# Never say never,
my friend #
Henri...
# If you believe that
your dreams will come true #
#They'll come true
in the end #
But...
Ah ah ah!
# Keep up your courage #
# Don't ever despair #
#Take heart
and then count to 10 #
# Hope for the best #
#Work for the rest #
#And never
say never again #
But it's impossible!
I'll never
find my family.
Never say never.
Don't say that.
# Never say never #
#Whatever you do #
Again.
# Never say never #
#To me #
See how easy?
# If you believe
you can come
shining through #
That's how
it's going to be.
Perfect!
# Now don't you
go and give up #
# Give out or give in #
#When the going's rough,
just get tough #
#And just tell yourself
you're gonna win #
# Remember to look on
the bright side till then #
#And never #
# Say never #
#Again #
Now are you ready
to go find your family?
Yes!
Chantal!
Take my friend
to immigration.
You will find
your family there.
Everyone goes
through immigration.
I would take you myself,
but I'd never
finish my statue.
Henri, you said never!
Oh, so I did!
# Never #
# Say never #
# Never #
# Say never #
# Never #
# Say never #
#Again ##
Au revoir!
Good luck!
Good-bye!
Keep it moving,
keep it moving.
Hurry, hurry!
Step off the boat
and into prosperity!
Welcome, greenhorns!
This is America!
Today's special,
the Brooklyn Bridge,
just a dollar!
Golly,
the Brooklyn Bridge!
Ticket to Chicago!
Used only once!
Gee whiz!
Only once, ma.
Get my apple
while it lasts.
Hurry,
it's going fast!
Apple, anyone?
Please put out
that filthy thing.
I'm suffocating
down here.
You're not the only
cockroach in New York.
Other roaches would love
to work for Warren T. Rat.
Good! Fire me.
I'm fed up...
with that smoke
and this pocket!
I've seen cleaner
kitchen stoves.
All right, Digit.
Hey, how much money
did we make today?
Oh.
Well, let's see.
carry 1, drop 2.
And 2 plus 2 is 22.
Whoa!
What's the boodle?
So far, we have
collected $89 and...
and 13 cents.
We'll get
another 17 from Moe.
That's 50 cents
less than yesterday.
What? 50 cents!
I hate to lose money.
Where can I find
an extra 50 cents?
Bye!
Au revoir,
my little immigrant!
Uhh!
Hey, boss, a kid.
Moe can always
use an extra kid...
at 50 cents a day.
Very interesting.
Ahem!
Well, well, well!
Rat's the name,
Warren T. Rat.
What can I do you for?
I'm looking
for my family.
You come
to the right fella.
I know exactly
where they are.
Henri said
I'd find them here.
Remember what
Shakespeare said...
And I quote...
Ahem.
"Opportunity knocks
but, uh... but, uh..."
Psst! Once!
"But once!
"Taken at the tide,
t'will lead to fortune.
If denied,
t'will never return."
You really know
where my family is?
Heh heh heh heh.
Trust me.
Hey, trust me.
Mama, I keep
having this feeling...
that Fievel's alive.
Tanya...
it will go away.
After a while,
it will go away.
Come with me.
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't break a gut there.
"Oh, pardon me,
"thou bleeding
piece of earth,
that I am meek and gentle
with these butchers."
This is
where they are.
Papa!
Aaah!
Not bad, huh, Moe?
A new worker.
What about
my family?
You don't need a family.
You got a job.
Send me his salary.
And where do you
think you're going?
You're mine!
Now get to work!
What are you
looking at?
Move!
I want to get
out of here.
You and me both.
I have to find
my family.
Go to sleep.
Aren't
you guys tired?
If we had that mouse
with the long hair,
we could all climb down.
Sure. Out the window.
Oh, fairy tales!
This kid
may have something.
Tony Toponi's
the name.
Put it there, uh...
Fievel.
Fievel Mousekewitz.
Fievel!
Ooh, that name's
got to go!
I'll tell you what...
Fillie!
Fillie?
Yeah! Fits you perfect.
Hey, Fillie.
You got any idea
where your family is?
Fillie!
Fillie Mousekewitz!
Hey, Fillie! Sheesh!
# Poor wandering one #
#Though thou
hast surely strayed #
#Take heart of grace #
#Thy steps retrace... ##
I pledge allegiance
to the flag...
of the United States
of America...
and to the Republic
for which it stands,
one nation...
Fievel!
Fievel!
What am I going
to do with you?
Come, little ones, eat.
Don't gobble so.
Back! Back! Mine!
Aah!
Papa.
Papa!
Papa!
Grand and Hester streets!
Here, Papa.
Here I am.
Papa?
Are you there?
Aaah!
It's a mouse!
A mouse!
Aaah!
Heh heh heh.
Hey, Fillie!
I been looking
all over for you.
Pardon
the expression,
but you look
like something
the cat dragged in,
you know?
Hey, you all right?
Yeah, I guess so.
You go running off,
you'll get seriously lost.
Stick with me, ok?
Hey, hey, hey!
What, are we engaged
or something?
Why can't we try
to find Fievel, Papa?
I know, Papa.
Play your violin.
Play Fievel's song.
Oy, Tanya.
You can't find
what's not there.
Ok, ok.
I got it
all figured out.
We'll look
for your family in...
Hih... hheh...
This is America.
Don't be afraid.
Are you going to let
those cats bully you?
Tony? Hey, Tony,
where you going?
Will we stand by...
and let cats
wreck our lives?
If we all got together,
we could do
something about them.
Yeah. We should
all get together.
This is America.
We have free speech.
You can say "cat."
Cat, cat, cat!
And double cat!
Shh! Not so loud.
Not that word.
Wait a minute.
Come back.
Where are you going?
Ahh...
s-s-so...
if we all got together,
we could do something
about the...
cats.
Yeah.
C...
Ca...
Cat.
Hhe-whe-nuh...
Tony?
Tony, what's
wrong with you?
She's talking
about
But there are
no cats in America.
I'm getting
out of here!
What are you
afraid of?
Cats, cats, cats.
Papa told me.
Everyone knows it.
There are no cats.
Hey, you all right?
I mean, you ain't
hurt or nothing?
No. No, I'm ok.
Thank you.
No, really,
I'm all right.
Really, I am.
How about you?
Nah!
Who do those cats
think they are?
I'll show them
next time.
Hey, where's Fillie?
Fillie?
Who's Fillie?
Oh, I gotta find him.
He's just a kid.
Fillie!
Tony!
Whoa!
Phew!
Some scrap, huh?
There are cats here!
Wait'll I tell Papa!
If I find him.
You see, he's looking
for his family.
Aw, the poor darlin'.
Wait a minute!
HonestJohn,
at Tammany Hall.
He knows every mouse
in the city.
Told you to stick
with me!
Come on.
Oh!
Well, Mr. "There-are-no-
whats-in-America"?
Cats!
Ha-ha!
It's me third wake
today,
and I'm not finished.
We've got
to do something
about them cats.
Aah!
Besides paying
Warren T. Rat
for no protection.
Oh, oh, poor lad.
So young.
He never had
a chance to vote.
Well, he'll vote
from now on.
I'll see to that.
HonestJohn.
It's Gussie Mausheimer.
Oh.
Ooey, the richest
and most powerful
mouse in New York.
What's she doing
slumming in this
part of town?
There's a dead mouse
on that table.
It's an Irish custom,
Gussie.
The cats
got him today.
Pwecisely why
I am here to see you.
Would you care
for a wee drop?
Today was the worst.
Those cats
are killing everyone.
They don't know
the difference
between wich and poor.
The wretches!
Oh, shameful!
As you know,
I've dedicated my life...
to helping those wess
fortunate than myself...
That's everyone.
And now you'll help me.
We must have a wawwy.
A wawwy?
What's a wawwy?
You know, a wawwy.
A warge gathewing of mice
for a weason.
Oh, a rally!
That's what I said,
a wawwy.
Tomorrow
at Mausheimer Park,
we will all decide
what to do.
I'll bring
the uptown mice.
You bring the mice
from downtown.
Madam, you can count
on HonestJohn.
At last, we're all
getting together...
about the cats.
Bridget.
Oh, Fillie.
HonestJohn,
he's lost his family.
Do you know
the Mousekewitzes?
Oh... hmm... are they
registered to vote?
They just
got off the boat.
Oh. Ahem.
Sorry. Don't
know them yet.
That's me mother
and father.
The cats got them
two years ago November.
Now, don't you worry.
Yours are all right.
They're out there
somewhere.
Now get some sleep.
# Somewhere out there #
# Beneath
the pale moonlight #
# Someone's
thinking of me #
#And loving me tonight #
# Somewhere out there #
# Someone's saying
a prayer #
#That we'll find
one another #
# In that big
somewhere out there #
#And even though
I know #
# How very far apart
we are #
# It helps to think
we might be wishing #
# On the same
bright star #
#And when the night wind
starts to sing #
#A lonesome lullaby #
# It helps to think
we're sleeping #
# Underneath
the same big sky #
# Somewhere out there #

can see us through #
#Then we'll

# Somewhere out there #
# Out where dreams
come true ##
Attention, pwease!
Attention, pwease!
You all know
why we are here.
We have got
to do something...
about these cats.
Not so loud!
They'll hear you!
So? Let them hear me.
You can talk!
You're rich!
Money isn't everything.
I know. I have
money  everything,
but what are they worth
without fweedom?
Hear, hear!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Right!
Why did we come
to America?
For fweedom!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Right!
Why are they building
that statue?
What does it stand for?
Fweedom!
So what do we want?
Fweedom!
Fweedom!
Fweedom!
Wight!
Fweedom from cats.
Because this is America,
we can do something
about them!
What can we do?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Papa, I can't see.
They're bigger
than us!
Not if we
work together.
What are you afwaid of?
Are we men,
or are we mice?
Mice!
Mice!
Mice!
Mice, indeed,
and proud of it!
What are we
going to do...
about those cats?
Well?
Any ideas?
Ahem.
Oh, yes,
well, I...
Oh, dear.
I have an idea.
Yes?
What did he say?
He said, uh...
Uh-huh. Hmm...
Yes! Cute little fellow.
Wait a minute.
I think
this wittle fellow
has got something here.
We have a pwan!
She's in
the way again!
Look out below!
Shh!
We have a pwan!
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want to
thank you so much...
for your participation.
I want to close
by saying...
a vote for HonestJohn...
is a vote for freedom!
Freedom!
And thank you again,
one and all!
Holy spumoni!
We should have been
at the pier an hour ago!
The pier? That's
a scary place!
I promised Bridget
we'd be on time.
Wait for me! Wait!
Geez, am I
in the doghouse!
Pick 'em up!
Why didn't
you wake me?
But, Tony,
I can't tell time!
Tony, slow down! Wait!
Wait!
Papa?
Tony!
Papa!
I'm coming, Papa!
Papa?
All right,
ante up, boys.
Hey, no cheating.
Brr!
Ooh!
I got it! I got it!
I got it!
Rummy!
Tiger, for
the hundredth time,
we're playing poker.
I knew that.
I knew that.
But who can concentrate
with all that noise?
Hey, Tiger...
when the boss plays,
it's culture.
Sure, culture.
I think it sounds,
uh, melodious.
"If music be
the food of love,
play on, McDuff,
play on."
I don't know what's worse,
the music
or the Shakespeare.
Rats! This nose
keeps interfering!
You could
stop playing.
Hey, that's funny.
I've never known
a cockroach
with good taste,
but I've known plenty
that taste... good.
Play! Play! Play!
Ahem.
Ahh!
Warren T!
You!
You're not a rat!
You're a cat!
How did you get in?
Come here!
Awoo!
Gentlemen, cat's
out of the bag!
Get me that mouse!
Let me at him!
I'll kill him!
Get out of my way!
You just stepped
on my tail!
Come here,
you little runt!
Get him!
Ppllt!
Once more.
There is the boat.
The boat whistle blows
at 6:00 in the morning,
and that is when...
we must rewease
the secret weapon!
Yeah!
Yay!
Hooray!
So the cats
must be here...
at 6:00 on the dot,
not a moment
before or after.
When you go
get the cats,
what do you do
to make them come here?
# Nyah nyah-nyah
nyah nyah ##
Wight!
Now get some sweep.
We have a wong day ahead.
Grr! On your guard,
Tiger!
Don't make
any funny moves.
I have the instinct
of a cat.
Wait... I am a cat!
Aw, I didn't mean
to scare you.
It's ok, little buddy.
I'm your friend.
Aw, come on. Be happy.
Oh, come on.
What are you crying for?
I have to get
out of here...
so I can
find my family.
You... lost your family?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, no.
That's terrible.
You know, I lost
my family, too.
Years ago, I mean.
Eight brothers...
three fathers...
Don't cry.
You'll find them.
Do you really think so?
Gee, you're nice.
Um, my name is Tiger.
What's yours?
Fievel.
Fievel Mousekewitz.
Listen. I like mice.
Waah!
Oh, no, not like that.
I don't eat red meat.
I'm a vegetarian.
Oh, a little fish
now and then.
But what I really like
is some... shh...
broccoli.
I thought cats
were supposed to be mean.
Mean? Ha! I am mean!
Grr! Grr!
Then... and...
aw, what's the use?
I like butterflies
with big golden wings...
and blue and green tips.
Me, too!
I like Swiss cheese
ice cream.
Me, too! Me, too!
You too, too? Hmm.
Wait. What's your
favorite book?
Um,
I can't believe it.
I can't believe it!
Prrr!

He's a cat.
He's their boss.

Throw down your money

I'll convince
them to stop.
You're wrecking
the plan!
It's not supposed
to happen this way.
Throw down that kid!
Oh, yeah?
Bull's eye!
Disregard the nose.
A nose by any other name...
would smell as sweet.
Great whiskers,
it's a cat!
He's a cat!
Hey, who will
you believe,
me or your own eyes?
Release the secret...
No, no!
Hey, easy, easy!
Ok. I take it
we can't do business.
Warren,
you're through.
Washed up, wuined!
You'll never
get another cent...
from any mouse anywhere.
Eh? We'll see
about that.
Just wait,
you little rat.
Just wait.
Adios!
Fire!
Oh! Tie it off! Hurry!
Oh, saints be praised.
It stopped.
Rewease the secret weapon!
Release? Oh, no!
Release the secret weapon!
Make up your mind!
Ooh, ooh! My goodness!
Rewease the secret weapon!
Release the weapon!
Release the weapon!
Release the blasted weapon!
Faster, Papa.
We can't do
business here, huh?
Heh heh heh.
Heh heh heh.
Release
the secret weapon!
Faster!
Look at that. Yeow!
It's the giant
mouse of Minsk!
Oh, you're right.
Head for the pier!
We did it!
Ladies and gentlemen,
credit where it's due.
We owe it all to Fillie
and his Mouse of Minsk!
# Now there are no cats
in America... ##
Fillie.
Who's Fillie?
Someday, Gussie Mausheimer,
someday!
And you, too,
Mousekewitz.
All of you!
I hate mice!
I'm having
a heart attack here.
Ahem.
Don't worry. There are
plenty of mice in Hong Kong.
I'll have to learn
to calculate
in Chinese.
Hmm. Let me see.
The pier's on fire!
Move it!
Move it!
You there,
come on!
Fillie!
Fillie Mousekewitz!
Where are you?
Tony, look.
Fievel!
Fillie!
Papa, listen.
Fillie
Mousekewitz!
So what? Someone's
calling a Fillie
Mousekewitz.
They changed
my name to Tilly.
Maybe they changed
Fievel's name to Fillie.
I've got to see.
Stop!
Hurry!
Fillie
Mousekewitz!
Fillie!
Wait!
Ohh! Stop! Oh!
You are calling for
Fillie Mousekewitz, right?
Here, tell my daughter
his name is Fillie and not Fievel.
His name
is Fillie.
You see?
And Fievel.
And Fievel?
Papa.
No, there are many
Fievel Mousekewitzes
in New York,
maybe thousands.
It could
still be another
Fievel Mousekewitz.
No, Papa.
Look.
Get a load
of this.
You're sleeping
in my place.
Huh?
Hey, give me that!
What's your story?
I've been looking
for my family.
He's looking
for his family.
He's looking
for his family!
I stopped that
long ago.
You know
who they are.
They should be
looking for you.
They don't care.
Forget them.
Right,
they don't care!
If they did,
they would have found me.
If they don't care,
I don't care!
Yeah, forget them.
You're one
of us now.
Here. Make
yourself a bed.
Pitiful.
I'll never find them
again anyway.
Never.
Never.
Never.
This is my home now.
Fievel!
Fievel!
Fievel!
Fillie!
Hey, Fillie
Mousekewitz!
I never dreamt I'd
be riding a fewine.
A fewine?
A cat!
I knew that.
I knew that.
Keep playing.
Keep playing.
We'll find him.
Fievel!
Fievel!
Fievel,
where are you?
Fievel?
Fievel?
Papa?
Papa?
Papa.
Fievel?
Papa!
Where are you?
Papa!
Fiev... Wait, stop!
Fievel!
I'm coming, Papa!
Fievel!
Papa!
Fievel, Fievel!
Mama, look!
Mama!
What's come over me?
I am hugging a cat.
I've never been
so happy before.
I have friends, lots
of little tiny friends.
Tony,
isn't it grand?
I don't hear no one
thanking me here.
Oh!
Fievel, I knew
you were alive.
My little boy
back from the dead.
America.
What a place.
My Fievel.
I thought I would
never see you again.
Never say never, Papa.
Oh!
Oh! I nearly forgot.
Here, Fievel, your hat.
Your hat...
it fits.
My son...
now you are a mouse.
My statue is finished.
Oh, la la la la.
Wait till you see her.
She is beautiful.
Mama, don't
be afraid to
open your eyes.
Look what
you're missing.
You're missing
everything.
Papa, when we land,
I'll look.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
No, whoa!
This is... oh, whoa!
This is nice.
Oh, thanks, fellas.
You in the front,
higher, higher!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Oh, Henri,
she's so beautiful.
Henri, what's that
over there?
Oh, that is
more America.
Can we see it?
Ho ho ho! You will,
my little American.
Ha ha ha!
Someday, you will.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
# Somewhere out there #
# Beneath
the pale moonlight #
# Someone's
thinking of me #
#And loving me tonight #
# Somewhere out there #
# Someone's
saying a prayer #
#That we'll
find one another #
# In that big
somewhere out there #
#And even though
I know #
# How very far apart
we are #
# It helps to think
we might be wishing #
# On the same
bright star #
#And when
the night wind #
# Starts to sing
a lonesome lullaby #
# It helps to think
we're sleeping #
# Underneath
the same big sky #
# Somewhere out there #
# If love can
see us through #
# Can see us
through #
#Then we'll be together #
# Somewhere out there #
# Out where dreams
come true ##
