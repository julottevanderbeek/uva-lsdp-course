-
- Hey, welcome back, Max.
- Let go of me!
Don't tell me this is
nothing about lunch money.
Two dollars and seventy cents?
We're gonna be living large
on this.
- If you guys want
a real score--
It's the wholesale mart.
Fifth and Broadway.
And all you need is...
this.
Another alien abduction,
Maxwell?
They wanted my optic lobes,
but they didn't get a thing.
- The key to the supply closet,
Maxwell.
- The key?
To the supply closet.
Oh, I left it in the door,
Mrs. Duke.
And you also left us
without enough time to hear
your little presentation.
But I want
to hear it anyway,
right here after school!
- Don't tell me.
- You were kidnapped by gypsies
and sold to the circus.
Oh, I see. Another
homework malfunction.
And, gosh,
what a surprise, detention.
you weren't here...
when we were robbed.
What kind of maniac would steal
the motor to our Hoover?
You were supposed to come home
today and help me clean up,
remember?
- It's just Travis.
- What is that supposed to mean?
You told me, men are like buses.
There's always another one.
I never said--
You know that this
is the only day that I
don't work a double shift...
and I really wanted
the house to look nice
for Travis.
Mom, it's not like
he lives here or anything.
Your feet?
What is this?
- What is this? Huh?
What have you got here, dreadlocks?
- Ow.
No, wait, look.
It's a tiny, living creature.
- Who put a squirrel
in your shorts?
- Max...
- try and look like this guy.
Max, we have to talk.
Oh, hey. We're in here.
Looking good, Max .
- Isn't he some dead
black-and-white guy?
- Apparently.
- But he's a very funny dead guy.
You tell him?
- Tell me what?
Max, um...
Travis and I...
want to get engaged.
I thought he was just
coming over for ribs.
-
- We wanted to wait 'til all
of the papers were signed.
- ''Papers''?
- The divorce papers.
There were some things
left unsigned by your father.
My father?
But I thought you didn't
know where he was.
- I didn't.
- Listen, Max...
what matters now
is you and your mom
can move on with your lives.
- Wait, what about me?
- Why didn't you ask me?
- Max--
Max.
Well...
now he knows.
- Hey, I want to talk to you!
Get him!
Come on, man!
Come on!
-  Watch it!
There are no gold watches,
no gold necklaces!
We'll get ya!
We got him now!
Understand... you're messing
with my little brother.
Don't tell me.
They couldn't fit the key
in the lock?
- There were no lockers.
- And your map was crap.
So there's only one place
this thing's gonna fit.
- Come on!
-
Where'd he go?
-
Go!
- I'm going around!
- I'm dead. I'm dead.
- ##
- ##
- How do I shut this thing off?
##
- Hi.
- You little turd!
You think
you got skills?
Can we just pretend
this never happened?
##
Who... dare to wake me?
Ain't gonna make this a mystery.
Don't wanna do time
on your wishes three.
Watch it, boy!
You don't want to dis me!
Now, who's that sorry wanna-be
that disturbed my z's?
Get out of my way!
If you want to be number one,
I'm sorry, boy,
that's been done!
But if you got the itches
for a sack of riches...
don't matter how avaricious...
I'm the man that
could grant your wishes!
Hey, don't turn
your butt on me!
I'm the man of the ages,
straight out of the pages!
Hang on! I'm contagious,
outrageous, spontaneous!
You can't contain this!
I am Kazaam !
- I'm really happy for you.
- Where do you think
you're going?
Listen, Mr. Psychopathic
Dork in the Basement...
I don't think
you're ordering anybody!
Do you realize who I am?
I'm your genie!
In that case,
I wish I was as big as you,
but not so stupid.
That's not a wish!
That's an insult!
Besides, I don't do
those kind of wishes.
I do material wishes.
See? Things. Stuff.
You gotta want something, kid.
Listen, you want to pull
the wool over someone's eyes?
Go get a sheep, okay?
Listen, it's only 'cause
this world really, really
gives me tension...
that I'm gonna do something
I don't ordinarily do.
I'm going to beg.
- Now, make a wish. Please?
-
Okay.
All right, okay.
Give me a car.
BlackJaguar-XKE.
Yes! Yes, yes!
-Jaguar? Black?
- XKE.
Jaguar, black.
Better stand back.
I am Kazaam !
-Jaguar, black, right?
Okay.
Kazaam!
Okay, well,
you just stay here.
I'm gonna go now.
- Uh-oh.
Hey, Kazoo?
- Kazoo?
- Say nighty-night.
- Come on, you gotta eat.
- Please.
Look, it's delicious.
Please.
Just hold them between
your fingers like this.
- I'm okay, all right?
-
Who did this to you?
- Max, what happened
to your--
-Just leave me alone!
- Max.
-
- I'll handle it.
- No, I really think
I should.
Please.
Max?
Max, can I come in?
Wow.
That's really great.
You finished it.
Hey, you're not building
a neutron bomb over here,
are you?
- That could be
a little dangerous.
- Don't touch that.
You okay?
You want to tell me
what happened?
Anytime you want to talk...
I'll be here.
##
-
- ##
##
Mom?
''Tuna. Home at 3:00.''
Sure.
- What the--
What the--
- Don't you wish
you had one of these?
What-- Are you like
really lonely or something?
I've been doing
this genie stuff
for about 5,000 years.
- It's not all
it's cracked up to be.
- I'm sure.
But I'll tell you what.
Why don't we start off
with something small...
and work our way up
to something big?
But let's just
get it done.
- All right?
- Why do I get the feeling
you'll never go away?
Wow.
You live here?
Yeah, I built it
myself too.
Hey, kid!
We're closed!
What's the matter with you?
Can't you read the sign?
Beat it!
Beat it!
You want me to turn him
into a dog or a cat
or something?
Your wishes are just
so spectacular...
- I don't know if I could
bear another one right now.
Your first wish?
That kind of thing could
happen to any genie.
- I was just
a little bit rusty.
- You know...
I bet they really miss you
and the nice building
with the padded walls.
Oh, excuse me, sir.
I'd like to speak to Mr. Matteo.
Who?
Your mother.
- Who am I talking to?
Hey, you're gonna have
to help me out, Mr. Shea.
Look, what I'm saying is
you're gonna have...
We'll take good care
of you, Paul. Uh-huh.
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.
Cindi,
if I wanted pressed turkey,
I would have run over myself.
- I do.
- Who are you?
- I'm... Max.
Theo, you call a messenger?
- Psst.
Try downstairs, kid.
Thank you.
So, tough guy,
who was that loser?
That was my father.
Hey-dee, hi-dee-ho.
Acted like he didn't
even know you.
Look, he hasn't seen me
in a long time.
I was two, okay?
- Away.
That's a long time away.
I mean, it's not two
or three thousand years,
but that's a long time.
Well, he's back now,
all right?
- And things
are gonna be different.
So how come you didn't
tell him who you were?
- What do you care?
- Who says I did?
- Why don't you just
leave me alone?
- Is that a wish?
Is that all you care about?
Look, you little fart...
you called me
into this mess of a world.
- I didn't call anybody.
- You popped the box,
so make a wish!
I can't show my magic
to anybody but you...
and I can't get back
into my box until you
make your three wishes.
Now, deal with it!
- Deal with this!
- Hey!
My turn.
Whoa! Whoa!
What I gotta do, kid?
Let's go!
You're on my turf now!
You'll be sorry!
Oh, Max .
- Oh, no!
- Remember me?
Make your three wishes.
I wish you'd go away!
Leave me alone!
- I'm gonna kick your butt!
- Dream on, loser!
No way I'm losing
this race, buddy.
I'm back! Take a break, kid.
You're gonna need it for this.
Say thank you
for your miracle.
- You are a genie!
- What's the matter?
Your tongue is broken?
At a time like this,
you should be stokin'.
Kazaam,
he got unlimited supply!
You'll give me anything?
Come on, boy,
you're not gonna die.
Open your eyes.
Don't ask why.
Just give it a try.
Then, then,
I wish I had junk food...
- Why not?
Higher than high.
Then you got junk food
from here to the sky!
I am Kazaam !
That's it?
A happy meal?
Oh, great.
Look out!
Ow.
So... where's
the hot chocolate?
Wait a second.
You're not telling me
that was a wish?
- Like the main man did
with the loaves and the fish.
I wish--
I just wish my mom and dad
would fall back in love.
Love? Kid, I told you,
Kazaam don't do ethereal.
- ''Ethereal''?
- Yeah. Love, hope, talking
to God, raising the dead.
Ethereal.
But I am Mr. Material,
and my stuff ain't too shabby.
Three-story mansion,
a sack of gold, a whole land
of milk and honey...
How long do I have
to come up with the wishes?
Now would be highly advisable.
- Come on, let's go.
- But I can wait, can't I?
I own you, don't I?
Technically.
Welcome to my life.
And here's a tip:
Lose the pointy shoes.
-
-
- It's lunchtime.
- Not according
to my watch.
- Huh?
What?
Ew!
- Wish I'd just what?
Is that a wish?
-
Let me make this
perfectly clear.
Next time you do that...
I'm donating your brain
to science, okay?
Look, all you gotta do...
is make your last
two wishes...
Mr. Mohammed Ali...
- and I'm outta here.
- Sure.
Come on!
Let's go right now!
Come on!
- Your whole way of thinking
really gives me tension, kid.
The name isn't ''kid.''
It's Max .
And another thing:
you're gonna do whatever I want.
And then, only then,
will I make my wish.
Do you understand?
Good.
- This whole ''I-gotta-get-
the-guts-to-talk-to-dad''...
- isn't gonna take
years, is it?
- Bite me.
I'm really
serious about this getting
something to eat.
It feels like
I'm getting shorter.
Stay here and try not
to hurt yourself!.
- Now this puts
the boom in box.
All right.
##
This isn't a toy store.
- my game.
- Impressive.
-
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Da Brat!
How are you?
What's up?
We're gonna make
the hottest live recording
anyone's ever heard!
- Yeah! How you doin'?
- Spanky, come over here.
I want you to meet someone.
- I want you to meet
my bodyguard, Spanky.
- Yeah, yeah. Bodyguard?
- What's up? He kind of
small, don't you think?
- I don't need much protection.
- We'll see
Mr. Matteo, I found this kid
wandering around backstage.
You?
What are you doing here?
What's your name?
Max.
- Who let this kid in here?
What's this, an amusement park?
-
It's not Mack.
It's Max .
- Okay, Maxwell.
- Connor.
Maxwell Connor.
You're my son.
Hey, everybody,
quiet down, quiet down!
Check this out!
-
- I want you to meet everybody.
This is Cindi.
- Hi, Max .
- And this is Frankie over here.
- Hey.
- What's up, little Max?
- Come over here.
And this amazing wonder
is Asia Moon. Son of a gun.
I can't believe it!
Look how big you got!
This is my son.
- Champagne?
- What, are you stupid?
He's a kid.
Get that outta here.
Hey, don't we have
some pizza comin'?
You like pizza, kid?
Come over here. I want you
to check something out.
You like music? Come here.
Sit down, sit down.
Listen to this.
##
So what do you think?
Is this place smokin' or what?
- How old are you?
- Twelve.
- Where the hell's the pizza?
Three large, two medium.
Pizza 'Zaam's here
to bust the tedium.
##
- You know him?
- I don't think rewarding him
is a very good idea right now.
- It's not to reward him.
- It's to straighten him out.
Where have you been, hmm?
Not at school.
You are grounded!
- Hold it, hold it.
- Two days you have not been--
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Alice.
- Because I am not finished.
- I'm a little busy.
From now on, you're gonna
come home from school, and
you're gonna start doing chores.
- ''Chores''?
- Yes, chores.
What do you mean, chores?
Milk the cows, feed chickens?
I don't get it.
- Max, this is
exactly the thing...
- All right, all right.
- That is really putting me
over the edge.
- Wait a minute. Forget chores.
Forget chores.
What we mean is,
we want to help you.
He's not picking me up
after school. I don't have
to listen to you, all right?
- You watch your mouth.
- Watch yours!
You lied to me!
You told me my father
wasn't here, but he is!
I've seen him!
Max.
Please.
Wait.
You're right.
I did lie.
Your father showed up
a couple of months ago
and...
I didn't know
what to do.
Why did he leave?
Sometimes things
just don't turn out
the way you plan.
I know that
I'm not the best mother
in the world, Max ...
one who's around,
who you can count on.
- No.
- what's ''grounded''?
- Something I'm not!
I'll get a job!
I'll show them!
- My dad will manage us.
What do you know?
You live in a box!
And I do see things.
Let me be the first to tell you,
the future don't always
follow the plan.
Because the plan
sucks big time!
See, I'm making
my future here, Kaz...
and the next step is
two all-access passes
to tonight's concert.

# Ooh party people,
Come on make some noise #

Throw up your hands #
# I'm lookin' at 'em, sister
All Bill, Bobs and Janes #
#There's nothing
Nothing there for me #
Don't say I didn't

No way, man.
This is cool!
Rocky, Bullwinkle,
shall we?
Come on, Rocky.
# Come on, do your thing
If you want it, Mr. Granite #
#A lady on the side
Get up, get up
If you can stand #
# Ooh
Who's the cutie over there
From another planet #
# Don't just stare
Come over here and let me
see you jiggy,jiggy jam it #
Buddy, it's like trying to hide
a tanker behind a sailboat.
- What if they don't like me?
- They already don't like you.
The question is,
what are you gonna do about it?
Get set for my
tete-a-tete-tete.
#The things I seen
Would make you sweat #
- # 'Cause I am Kazaam #
- # Ooh, man #
# In your coffee, I'm the cream
One wish, I get extreme #
Oh, Mr. Malik.
- I always deliver...
-
# Grab four of your friends
We'll have a sextet #
# Hmm, I don't know
He's kind of making me sweat #
# I got your sweat
But can this man slam it #

are hungry #
- # Uh-huh, and #
# Let's green egg

##
I'm looking for Mr. Matteo.
##
All right.
##
- I quit!
- Get over here!
The last one
of these tapes was worth
a million dollars to Malik.
- 'Cause piracy's a felony, Nick.
I don't want to be involved.
- Oh, r--
What are you doing here?
Get outta here! Let me
paint a picture for you, Ed.
- Fine. Go ahead
- You are involved!
- No, I'm not involved.
- I said get out of here!
- Dad--
- It's not my problem anymore!
- I got 50,000 blanks coming in
our little loading dock!
- You better have
that tape ready by 3:00!
- Dad!
- Forget about it, Nick.
- I told you to get out of here!
- I'm tellin' ya,
I'm outta here!
- Shut up!
You stay there.
- Dad, I thought
it was just gonna be you and I.
- There is no ''you and I.''
- Dad.
- Get out and stay out!
But, Dad,
you don't understand.
I told you Spinderella
would pack the house.
You mean you've done
your job. Good boy.
But what I am really
interested in is this man.
- I don't know who he is.
Just some guy.
You gotta watch
for these things, Nick.
You gotta
keep your eyes open
for new talent.
You gotta look
for the sparkle.
Nick tells me
what a good man you are.
I'm counting on it.
Hey, what are you
doing here?
I didn't know
Spinderella opened the show
with a dwarf tossing.
-
- Where'd you find this,
trash dumpster?
- No, I was in there,
all right?
- a key to the studio.
I can go wherever I want.
I got pull.
- Oh, he's got pull now.
Pull this.
- Yeah.
They're taping it right now.
If I wanted to, I could go
straight back in there...
straight to the recording booth
and put the tape in your hands.
Hey...
you mean that, homie?
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
-
Him? He's tall, Malik.
Don't mistake that
for interesting.
I was raised
to find everything interesting.
He's got a secret
bigger than he is.
Know a person's secret,
you own them.
- Bring me his.
Kazaam! Hey, Kazaam !
- Malik would like you
to join us tonight.
The thing is...
I'm looking for Max .
He's with Nick.
And I think we'll
just be in the way.
Please, my favorite.
- Nubian goat eyes?
- The food of kings!
I haven't had these
in 3,000...
days.
You have old-fashioned taste.
I don't get out much.
- Shh!
-
-
- You're late!
Come on!
Hurry up!
- What, are you crazy?
-
All right.
Hey, Shep,
bring it down here!
Wait right here.
I'll be right back down.
Close the door.
- What door?
- The loading dock door.
Just press the button.
- What button?
Hey, wait!
-
- Let's go!
- All right, you punks!
All right, let's go!
Let's go!
- Come back here, you guys!
Hey--
Hey, hold it right there!
- Hey!
- Come on back here!
Mom?
- # 'Cause I am Kazaam ##
-
- # I'm more than I seem #
- Get off me!
- #You are looking
at the dream #
- Let me go! Ow!
- # In your coffee
I'm the cream ##
- Get off me, you pervert! Ow!
Get out of my bed!
You know, you were right for me
to get out there last night.
They totally loved me.
-
- What are you
doing here anyway?
Look, Virgo.
That wasn't here yesterday.
- Hey, what's this?
- What are you
doing here anyway?
- What you looking for?
Nothing is good.
What's this, science?
''Polar covalent bonds
have an ionic--''
You know this stuff?
My mom wishes I did.
-
Wow. You're a genie too.
You should've seen us last night
in Malik's limo,just chillin'.
Having a good time,
eating goat eyes,just chillin'.
What's that?
You-You smell like
hippopotamus butt!
Damn.
##
##
##
You know, your father sure
is lucky to work with Malik. He
says I got a future in the biz.
Especially now.
So, you and your father
have a nice night too?
- Nice night?
- Ahh. Ooh.
Rotie francaise?
I love it
I figured if I ended your
suffering, mine would end too.
Max. Last night--
don't do that again.
I made your favorite,
with chocolate chips
and peanut butter.
- I'm not hungry.
Do I have to have this--
- Max! Please!
For once in your life,
let me have the last word.
Okay?
-
-
So, so sorry.
Max insisted.
I-I'm sorry.
H-Have I met you before?
No, ma'am,
I haven't had the pleasure.
I am Jefferson Allensworth Lamb.
and ''Lamb'' because I like
to eat lamb chops.
-
- And you're
a friend of Max 's?
but the school district
more commonly refers
to me as a tutor.
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
I-I didn't hear the door.
Uh, you've
been studying?
Y-Yeah, yeah, I have,
inverse ratios of height
to intelligence.
He gets that wit
from me.
Uh, well, Mr. Lamb,
would, uh-- Have you
had breakfast yet?
Chocolate and peanut butter
French toast?
Heavenly.
Oh, please. Sit down.
What are you doing here?
Get out of here. Get out.
- I'll make some more.
- Don't bother.
I'm not hungry.
- Breakfast wars.
Yes, you are.
- Not even
a little hungry?
- Oh, Max?
-  What?
So, what did you
and your father
do last night?
Do?
Uh, lots of stuff.
- ''Stuff'' is good.
What kind of stuff?
- Stuff, okay?
Oh. Hmm,
I used to do stuff
a long time ago.
Shouldn't you
be going to school?
- I'm not going.
- Say what?
No, I'm not going
to school!
So, what do you
think about this shirt?
Do I look cool or what?
Hey...
what's like the worst
thing you've ever seen
in your life?
The destruction of Pompeii.
- That was a wish?
That was you?
- Look, I didn't have a choice.
Besides, I did some
hard time under that ash.
Try 342 years.
So, like, I mean,
what about you?
You ever take anything
you shouldn't have...
- Me?
Yeah. Like, what's
the worst thing
you've ever done?
Look, can we talk
about this later? I got things
I gotta do, people I gotta see.
- What?
- Ready for what?
- For tonight.
- Tonight?
- I'm gonna perform.
- You?
- Yeah, you said I was cool.
Yeah, well, what are you
gonna rap about?
You're right.
The whole thing
is giving me tension.
- I can't even decide what to wear.
- It doesn't matter what you wear.
I mean, but you gotta have
something to rap about,
your rhymes.
I mean, you gotta have
something to say.
- Now what do you know
about rapping?
- I know a few things.
-  Yeah, right.
- My name is Max ,
so get these facts.
- I'm on my heavy B.M.X.,
and I make some tracks.
- That's whack!
- That's horrible!
Oh, my God, that's awful.
- You do better.
# My name is Kazaam
I got the whole plan
So listen to the man #
- # 'Cause I'm the sultan
of sand #

Is that the whole deal #
#You want to be a hit
You better get real #
# I did have this friend
in 1 000 B.C. #
# Hbur looks to me
and I says to he #
#Why don't we jump
in that old Euphrates #
#So that's the whole story
That's all you gotta tell #
#You got to listen to my rap

I cannot hear you!
What are we?
#We genie ##
Man, it must be great
to be a genie.
Sure, except
you're locked up.
A couple of millennia later,
your lamp breaks.
Oh, you think you're free,
but you're sucked
into a compass.
You go down with the ship.
One day, you're salvaged.
You wind up in a radiator,
a trombone. You got it;
a broken boom box.
But you can just
snap your fingers
and have anything.
Yeah, but I can't
make myself free.
Or make someone
fall in love.
Or even make someone
fall in love with me.
I can't even touch destiny.
Well, I just wish I could
change things, you know?
Make things different.
You're not talking
about genies. You're
talking about djinn.
Djinn?
What's a djinn?
A djinn is free.
A djinn can do anything.
Love, the future, fate.
The problem is,
djinn only exist
in fairy tales...
and I don't believe
in fairy tales.
Yeah, well, I don't believe
in fairy tales either.
- But then again,
I don't believe in wishes.
- And look what you got.
- Doesn't your school
have a bell?
Yeah. All right.
I guess I better be going.
- See ya.
- Yo, the business man.
- Yo, what's up, man?
How's it going?
Having fun, Max?
Some  huh?
So, you gotta talk
to your dad.
Tell him if he
wants the tape back,
it's gonna cost him.
You don't do this--
You don't want to say no.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
-
-
-
You knew the tape
was worth a million dollars.
He was gonna work it off?
I know how much it was worth.
I'll find it.
But what will I find?
My loyal friend...
or a man at the bottom
of the lake?
I'll get it to you
by midnight tonight.
But I still find it curious.
How could that be?
I don't know.
Neither do I.
-
Kazaam! Kazaam!
Revere is ready,
but he doesn't have a horse.
So he wishes for the fastest
damn mare in creation.
And what do you know;
a country is born.
Where did you learn
all this, Harvard?
Harvard? I'm way
too intelligent for Harvard.
I experienced my academia
in Upper Mesopotamia.
But nothing is more major
than my studies in Asia.
So how'd you get to work
for a guy like Malik?
- You don't want to know.
- Yes, I do. Try me.
With a talent like yours,
you'll get to know him
as well as I do.
But will I get
to know you?
I'll be right back.
Kazaam!
- What the--
- Get off the table.
- Kazaam, I gotta make a wish!
- What are you doing?
Get off the table.
- Kazaam, I need
a wish, okay?
- Right now?
No, in 250 years, stupid!
I need a tape. No, no,
I  I had the tape.
- What kind of tape?
- The master tape
of last night's show.
Can't your father
give it to you?
No! Do you have
a problem with this wish?
- No, it's just that
it's your second wish.
- So?
- So you want
to waste it on a tape?
- I just do, okay?
Just get me the tape! I mean,
come on, you know the drill.
''I am Kazaam --'' Let's go!
-
- That we can do.
-
- Huh?
No!
-Just saving you a wish, my man.
- I-It's not here.
I just know, okay?
Why are you stalling?
All you ever wanted was
to make my three wishes!
'Cause you're blowing
a whole wish!
Something's wrong.
I got a nose
for this kind of stuff.
I don't need a friend,
I need a genie! Now, grant
my second wish! I order you!
Your wish is my command.
- I'm outta here.
- Let me assist you.
Four of the republics
of the former Soviet Union--
Whoa!
Uh, Unocal?
Unistan?
Pakistan?
Stan the man?
- Detention!
##
Tell me you
had a wonderful breakfast.
Tell me that you
couldn't have another bite.
Tell me everything.
L.S.U. Grad...
professional performer
since he was eight.
Come on, Asia.
Give Kazaam another shot,
won't you?
I know there is something
about that boom box...
and I am just dying
to find out.
- Yo,Jake.
Mrs. Duke sucks.
We gotta talk.
See you later, man.
- Come on, in the car.
Wait. Max. Max.
- Nick, what the hell
do you think you're doing?
- This is between me and my boy.
Your boy? You haven't
seen him in over a decade.
You have no rights here.
- This has nothing
to do with you.
- You want me to call the cops?
- Max, he's not what you think he is.
Get out of the car.
- Let go.
- Max.
- Go back to Travis!
Max, no! Max, no!
No, stop!
Never in my life have I ever
seen something so stupid!
- But Dad, I-I--
- I know what you stole,
you and your punk friends!
- Dad, please--
-
-
Jesus.
Why'd you have to come now?
Mom was gonna marry Travis.
I thought
I'd never see you again.
You must have really
thought I was something.
I never knew what to think.
You were gone.
You don't want to be like me.
You got a choice. I don't.
You understand?
and pretend all this
didn't happen.
Do you know how many cops
would love to lock me up?
All right, look.
I want to tell you something.
You get no second chances
in life.
You get no second chances.
Remember that.
Go on, get outta here.
Go on, go!
It has nothing to do
with the box.
Well, if you're looking
for this, I found it.
- Start production.
- You got it.
I want to talk to you
about your son.
- # I am Kazaam #
-
# I am Kazaam
I am Kazaam ##
Yes.
Whoo!
- Kazaam! Kazaam!
I got it, I got it!
Kazaam! I need
to make my last wish!
- Say what?
- My third wish!
I wish my dad had a second chance.
- Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.
- What is it?
I wish my dad
had a second chance.
- You know,
like a different life.
- No can do, kid.
- Kazaam, you gotta help me!
- We've been
over this before.
- New lives, destiny.
Kazaam can't do ethereal--
- Kazaam !
I need this more than
anything I've ever needed
in my entire life!
- I mean, can't you even try?
- Believe me, I've been
trying all my life.
-Just try harder!
- Look, I can't do it!
- Kazaam, I gotta make this wish!
- When you gonna learn? Life
ain't about wishin' and dreams.
- It's about what you got and
what you can do with it!
- Please! This is all my fault!
I'm not some djinn.
I just can't snap my fingers
and make you happy.
You just don't want to grant
my third wish, do you?
You've got all this,
and now you don't want
to go back in your box!
- I thought
you were my friend!
Friend?
Don't you remember?
I'm just your genie!
- You--
- You're nothing!
- Max!
What is it?
- Nothing!
- What's the matter?
-Just leave me alone!
Max!
- He'll be all right.
- He was really upset.
I know,
but listen to this crowd.
They love me. I own them.
- You don't own them!
- Say what?
- You don't get it, do you?
Look, look,
look what you have!
Do you know how jealous
you are making me?
Huh? Huh?
- I'm just telling my story.
- No, it's much more.
There is an ancient phrase.
-
- ''Sultan's gold.''
You speak!
- Uh, you know--
-
You are
the ''sultan's gold''!
You got two minutes.
- Where's my box?
- Don't worry about
the little things.
- Listen.
Your public calls.
Trust me.
This is my world.
My sultan's gold...
lives in a genie's lamp.
- Get outta here!
- Dad, what happened?
- Go! Go!
- At long last.
Look familiar?
Your father's been
very modest...
about your
accomplishments, Max .
That's right.
I've got the box, and
you're on your last wish.
Look, Malik, let's stop
playing these games.
I don't know what
you're talking about,
and neither does he.
You can't keep all
these secrets from me.
Dad! What are you doing?
You can't--
Make the wish,
I get the genie.
And everything
my heart desires!
And if you
try anything clever...
will wake up...
dead.
Klass K! Klass K!
''I want Malik to have all
the money in the world.''
Don't you see, I wished
for that, but you can't do that.
Because if you do that...
the rest of the world
goes broke and money
isn't worth anything!
Then I'll take all the money
and give some of it back!
- I can't! I can't just say,
''Hey, Kazaam , I need your help,''
and he'll appear
right in front of me.
- I can't just say, ''Kazaam !''
-
Let's get busy, K!
Make the wish...
or your father will die.
I count to three.
One, two, three!

-
- #Trapped in a box #
# Like a premature burial #
- # Used to mull in the space cemeterial #
- Get outta here!
-
-
Get out! Get out!
# Suffered a curse
That was more than malarial #
# Lived as a ghost
Granted wishes material #
# Served every Tom, Dick
and Harrial #
-
-  Help!
- Run!
Come on!
To the right!
To the right!
- Stay over here!
Stay over here!
-
-
- Look out!
-
-
#And if you think that's bad
Here's my age #
# Oh, square octogenarial #
# Been there, done that
He's seen it all #
# Had a lot of riches
and material things #
- Shh!
-
- Let's go this way.
Oh, here they come.
- Come on!
Come on!
- We can't find--
- Go left!
Go left!
# So I peeled that spiel
Got real with the new meal #
# Sucking life down
Like a cutlet of veal #
-
What are we gonna do?
- All right, wait here.
- What are these?
Dad, look out!
Let's run for it!
Go! Go!
# Man, way mystical
and him, well, magical #
-
I'm the one with the power.
I'm the one with the genie.
Kazaam, he's my genie.
And as long
as I'm standing here, he'll do
whatever I tell him to.
# One snap of my fingers,
Get a scoop of Ben and Jerrial #
# Living so rich
Better watch my arterials #
# Don't get me down with those
thoughts of ethereal #
- # I know who I am #
Then I guess
my only problem is...
that you are still standing!
-
- # I'm-- #
Kazaam!
It worked!
- I don't understand.
- You've been called.
Where's Max?
Max...
-
- But I haven't granted
his third wish yet.
Trust me, he won't be
asking for any more.
What'd you do with him?
It's begun.
- Ooh!
- No.
Yes.
-
-
-
-
Oh!
You can't hurt me.
I am your master!
- What?
- I'll never be your slave!
-
- Now... where's Max?
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
He fell down the shaft!
- What?
- There was nothing
that I could do!
Put me down.
I'm afraid of heights.
Wish not granted.
Ooh! Ahh!
-
- Max, Max , Max --
- Lady. Lady, where you goin'?
Now you can't go in there.
- I think my son's in there.
- You can't go--
- I think that
my son is in--
- Lady, you can't go in there.
- Okay, look, I need
to find Travis. He's a fireman.
- Travis?
- Travis O'Neil.
Travis O'Neil
is in there.
Hey, tough guy.
No!
In 5,000 years...
you're the only friend
I've ever had.
And when you
needed me the most...
I wasn't there.
And if I had to spend
another 5,000 years...
in a lamp, a compass...
or even that stupid boom box...
I wouldn't care.
I just wish...
I could have granted
your wish.
I wish I could have
filled your heart.
You-- You are
the sultan's gold, Max .
I--
I am Kazaam .
Do you have to shine
that in my eyes?
You're alive!
You're alive!
-
-
Put me down, put me down!
I made a wish,
and I granted it!
- Put me down!
- You're alive!
-
-
What was that?
- I don't know.
This has never happened before.
You're leaving.
You can't.
I haven't made
my third wish yet.
But you did.
You wished for a second chance
for your father.
- But wait, I--
- And now it's done.
- But-- No, you don't
understand!
- What's happening to you?
- I don't know. I just feel--
free!
You-- You're--
- You--
and I'm free.
No.
- Kazaam... you can't.
- Don't go!
- In our hearts,
we're all djinn...
- Kazaam, you can't.
- The power...
is in... your heart.
I make a grab like that
and you don't even say,
''nice save''?
- What happened?
- Let's go.
- Max?
Is he okay?
- Yeah.
Is he all right?
Max, are you okay?
Max! Oh!
You're all right.
You did okay.
- Travis,
get him a blanket?
- Sure.
I was in the building
and Kazaam ...
- he was there
and he took me...
- Okay, okay. Okay, Max .
- And he flew and then he--
- It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
I got you now.
Okay? It's okay.
I don't know what happened.
All of a sudden, I was free.
He said something
about a second chance.
You're a good kid, Max .
You got a good heart.
Look, there's a few things
I gotta take care of.
- Some people I owe.
That'd be me.
Look, when I come back,
I'd like to see you.
We can get together and,
I don't know...
get a couple rods
and go fishing.
Sounds like a plan to me.
If that's all right
with you.
Thanks.
Are you okay
with this, Max?
- Hey, Mom.
- Yeah?
- Can we go home now?
- Sure we can.
- Come on.
- Hey!
You coming or what?
You talkin' to me?
Okay.
- Are you sure you want
to marry this guy?
- Well, that's the plan.
Let me tell you something.
I've been dealing with this
woman for 1 2 straight years.
Now, we're talkin'
three baths a week...
- trash detail, cleaning your room.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- Three baths a week?
- Mm-hmm.
With soap.
- That's cold.
- Speaking of which, I could sure
use a nice hot cup of chocolate.
- Get real.
You're getting a job.
- Ajob?
Hey, hey, hold on, hold on.
Ajob? I ain't worked
in 5,000 years.
Well, th-there's
a first time for everything.
