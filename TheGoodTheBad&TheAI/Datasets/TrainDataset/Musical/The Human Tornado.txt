He's a Human Tornado
Mules has kicked me
and didn't bruise my hide
rattlesnakes has bit me
they just rolled off and died
I handcuffed a lion and it
was a raging feat
I don't want no dilapidated
sea-slapping pigeon-throated
cross-eyed
bow-legged son of a gun
messing with me
I've been known to rise up
but I'll cool down later
I'm a bad motor scooter
I'm the Human Tornado
The Human Tornado
He's a Human Tornado
He's a Human Tornado
-  Ladies and
gentlemen, here he is.
The star Dolemite.
- Yes, I have been rough.
And you know I'm also tough.
I'm bad and sometimes
I get very mad.
I've been known to be mean,
but right now y'all
can look and see
that I'm damn sure clean.
Now I see a lot of lovely
people in this house tonight.
Look at this big fat man.
My my my my girls look
what y'all could get
if you was lucky.
Well I say one thing,
he can lay heavy
but he'll never go deep.
I bet he tells the average girl
you may not know I'm in there,
but you're damn sure
know I'm on there.
I see this big
fat lady with him.
My my my my my,
young lady you've got
the same damn thing them
lil skinny girls got.
But a damn sight more of it.
Is that your husband?
Ain't that a damn shame?
You need a little
skinny man, baby.
You and that man get
in the bed together
and try to do y'all thing
would be a mission impossible.
I'm gonna tell you like the
bathtub told the toilet stool
I get as much ass as you,
but I don't have to
take all that shit.
Young lady went out with her
boyfriend the other night,
and he got into bed
with her and pulled out
something like my little finger.
She looked at it and said,
well you no-screwing,
pencil-dick,
Pistol-Peter son of a gun.
Says I tell you what
I will do for you.
Since you can't
do nothing for me
with a joint that small,
said I'll give you $50
if you can hurt me.
He screwed her three
times and hit her
in the head with a rock.
There's some ugly mother
fuckers in this house tonight.
If you don't believe
it, look over here.
Baby
you are so ugly you stopped
this motion picture from runnin.
Yo lips like you wearing
a turtleneck sweater.
I had a brother
look just like you,
he stuck his head out the window
and his lips beat him to death.
My my my, that's what
I call stretching
a good thing a bit too far.
Two soldiers went to Vietnam,
a black soldier and a white
soldier, can you dig it?
And they come all
the way back home,
and the people in
Louisiana said we gonna
give y'all anything
that y'all want.
They looked at the
white soldier and said,
young man, what do you want?
He said, well I'll tell
you all what I want.
I want me $10,000 and a
Lincoln Continental to drive.
They said, we gonna
get that for you.
Then they looked at the
brother, they said brother,
what would you like?
The brother said, well
y'all can give me
a dollar and a half
from the head of my
ding-a-ling down to my balls.
They said brother, brother,
don't you want no
more than that?
He said, no that's all I want.
So he pulled it out
and they put a dollar
and a half at the head of it.
Then they put another
dollar and a half on it,
and another dollar and a half,
another dollar and a half,
and another dollar and a half.
And one of those fellas
looked at him and said,
nigga, where is your balls at?
He said in Vietnam.
Young lady took her boyfriend
out with her the other night.
You know?
She got into bed with him,
and baby he did his thang before
he could get on top of her.
And he looked at her and said,
go in the kitchen
and fix me some food.
She went in the
kitchen and brought him
a head of lettuce and
a bowl of carrots.
He looked at her and said,
why in the world did
you bring me these
carrots and lettuce out here?
She looked at him,
said, mother fucker
you fuck like a rabbit,
you might as well
eat like one.
- Dolemite you might
come like a rabbit yourself.
- Now this is what
I call a nigga
that always wanna
get in the show.
This is the kinda nigga
that'll fart in a bathtub
and turn around and
bite the bubble.
Ladies and gentlemen
tonight has been a pleasure.
Thank you for letting
us be ourselves.
I ain't lying!
-  Dolemite
ladies and gentlemen!
- You really came at a bad time.
I'm very very busy.
Relax, take off your thangs,
and I'll see you later.
- I've invited you
all here to inform you
that the money drive
that was planned
six months ago by our
planning committee,
to purchase a new boys home,
has been called abruptly closed.
But along with the bad news,
there's always good news.
I'm going to allow the man
that's caused all
of this to happen.
Your friend and mine,
brother Dolemite.
- Thank you.
I'm so glad you could come.
As you know I've been
having a lot of hard knocks.
And a lot of trials
and tribulations.
And I've had a lot of success.
And I think it's a shame
for anyone successful
not to share it with others.
So today I'm doing
something that I wanted
to do for a long time.
I'm giving my home
and its entirety
to the gentleman that started
the drive for the boys home.
Let us now talk to some of
our distinguished guests.
Alright let's get
this shit over,
I ain't got all day.
- Dolemite.
You're worth every
damn cent I pay you.

And kidnapped TC and Java.
- Kidnapped em, what you mean?
- Kidnap em, and forced us
to come and work for him.
And said that if I didn't
come and work for him,
he'd kill em.
- Cavaletti must
be nuts to think
he can get away with
some shit like that.
Who the hell does
he think he is?
- That's what I wanna know.
He must think he is
the new Godfather
or some kinda shit.
- He's pissed cause I was
making more money than he was.
Here he come now, look.
- Your ice is melting Queenie.
What's with the chatter?
- They were just

Since you work for us, you
can't have any friends.
Now get back to work.
Well folks, I want you to know

But don't worry

Yeah.
- Java, what are we gonna do?
- I don't know girl.
But whatever it is,
it's gotta be quick.
This is sick.
- Dolemite, I've been
waiting for you so long.
- Baby, good things

come large or small
but we're known for kicking ass
and we can handle em all.
- Hello?
- Queen, stop what
you're doing this minute.
Cavaletti wants you
and your bitches
over here within the hour.
- Oh just a second please.
This is from Joe.
Pick up on the other phone.
Would you tell Joe
that all the girls
are on their monthly.
And they will not be able
to be over there tonight.
- Now you listen to me Queen.
- What's the matter now?
- She ain't coming.
- What do you mean
she's not coming?
Gimme that phone.
Queen Bee, you better
get your ass over here
and I mean on the double.
- Under one condition.
That you turn my girls loose.
- Look Bee, you're in no
position to bargain with me.
Now you get your
hot ass over here,
or I'll massacre
those black bitches.
I'll give you just one hour.
- Why you rat-soup
eating motherfucker!
- I guess you heard all of that.
- That's all I needed to know.
That the girls are still alive.
Now I can work with that
cranny-dodging motherfucker.
So here's what we do.
- Brother QB what's happening?
- I wanna talk to you man.
- Oh I don't have time
fellas, I got a lot to do.
I'll talk to you later.
- Later on will be too late man,
we need to rap right now.
- That's right brother
man, right now.
- Oh some heavy shit, huh?
- Dig it.
- Okay, sock it to me.
Cavaletti's men blew away
my brother this morning.
- Oh no, you mean Jeff is dead?
- That's why we come to you man.
We need your help.
- Okay I'll tell you
what we'll get together
this afternoon and see what
we can map out, alright?
- Say look here,
I got information
on a house in Pasadena man,
where the motherfuckers
torture people.
- A torture chamber?
Goddamn I haven't heard of
no shit like that in years.
Listen, did you get
any information on
the guys that laid
your brother away?
- Yeah.
The motherfuckers was black.
- Yeah, brothers.
- Mannix, what's new
on the Sheriff case?
- Well I gotta see
some mugshots Chief.
- It's in the Dolemite file,
you've got everything we have.
- The Sheriff's case
is nothing compared
to what I've come up with.
Another 187.
This time the finger points to.
Mr. Cavaletti.
-  Cavaletti?
-  That's right.
- Do you have grounds?
- Well sir we share some
brotherly information.
- Good.
Gimme the information
and I'll assign
somebody else to the case.
I don't want you biting
off more than you can chew.
You concentrate on
the Sheriff case.
Get Dolemite.
- You mean you're
assigning me to help
some hokey Sheriff
solve a murder case
which we know nothing about?
And for two years, I've
tried to nail Joe Cavaletti.
And finally I get this
asshole by his balls,
and you wanna assign
somebody else to the case?
- Now dammit Pete.
You will do as you're told.
- Good.
I remember the other day
I was told my vacation
started today,
and I'm taking it.
- Son of a bitch.
- What brings you
this way my friend?
- I've got news for ya.
- How you know I'm
looking for needles?
- I heard through the
grapevine that you
were trying to get Queen's girls
back from Cavaletti, right?
- So?
- I got some real strong info
from some friends of mine.
- So let's have it.
- Info like that
don't grow on trees.
It costs money you know.
I got a sick aunt.
- Hold it.
Information first.
- Well Cavaletti's got
this house in Pasadena.
It's a real chamber of horrors.
Like he really fucks
people up over there man.
- Where's it at?
- I haven't found that out yet.
- Well how do you find out?
- If somebody was to get
Cavaletti's main woman,
then they might find
out where the house is.
- Where does Cavaletti
keep his main woman?
- Well
Cavaletti usually
keeps her at his pad.
She's a nice bitch.
I heard that she's a
common freak, you know?
A real nymphomaniac.
- Where's Cavaletti's house?
- In Pasadena baby.
- May I help you?
- Yes, is this the
Cavaletti's residence?
- Yes, it is.
What can I do for you?
- My card first, Madame.
- Frank Huck
Delmonico NcAdeemus?
- Yes.
Are you Mrs. Cavaletti?
- Yes, I am.
- Mrs. Cavaletti
I am a connoisseur of the rarest
most interesting nude studies.
- I am not interested.
If you'll just...
- Ms-Cavaletti, if you
would wait just a moment
and gaze upon this
exquisite artwork,
I'm sure you'll be interested.
Madame.
I see you like my work.
Miss?
Miss Cavaletti?
Mrs. Cavaletti?
You do like my work?
I've got something
better for you.
You'll like it.
Big black strong man.
Ah. Ah.
You'll enjoy it.
Miss Cavaletti, Miss Cavaletti?

-
They're at the house
on the hill in Pasadena.
- Have a seat.
- No thanks.
- Some coffee?
- No thanks, I've
had my breakfast.
I just came here to find out
what you got on
that Dolemite boy.
It's been a while since
I've heard from you.
I wanna know what's happening.
- Well when we get something,
I'll let you know.
I've got my best
man on the case.
- He ain't made no
contact with me yet.
- Well this particular man
works better by himself.
He's my undercover
man for the ghettos.
- You mean to tell me you sent
a nigger out to
find another nigger?
Why that's the most
ridiculous thing
I've ever heard of.
- Sheriff.
We don't have any niggers here.
Just damn fine police officers.
Some of the best in the country.
Now if you can't respect that,
and if you can't accept
my choice of assignment,
you can get your
ass out that door.
And if you don't like that
you can go to the Chief.
- I'll do just that Captain.
And when I find him, I'll
bring his head to you.
Since you love niggers so much.
You can mount Dolemite's
head on your mantlepiece.
Good day, Captain.
- Fuck you.
- Sweetheart.
Call Queen.
Tell her to bring everybody
that works for her
to my party tonight.
Tell them to be ready at eight.
I'll have them picked up.
- Hello?
- Joe wants you to scrounge
up all the girls you can
and bring em over here tonight.
We'll send someone after you.
- Yes ma'am, we'll be there.
- Well.
Looks like we've all been
invited to the party.
But this time
this will be the party
to end all parties.
Okay.
We know that Cavaletti has
an army compared to us.
We're outnumbered in people
but not in skill.
Just remember
if anybody come out alive
be sure it be one of us.
Now how did you say this worked?
- Well tonight
is Cavaletti's birthday party.
You'll have all his
big shit friends there.
- So if we get em
all at one time,
it's got to be tonight.
- Has anybody heard
from Dolemite?
- Howard Jackson!
- Is that the bad little nigga
that taught me martial arts?
- In person.
- Lord things is looking better.
- Looking better?
With that little shit?
Well I'll take my dick and
beat his goddamn ass with that.
- We'll see about that brother.
- Did you hear about
the new contract?
- No, what is it?
- It's Queen Bee,
Annie, and Dolemite.
- Who's doing the job?
- Red and Fingers.
- Well that's Wild.
With those three out of the way,
the boss will have no problems.
- Right.
- Okay, we'll be right out.
Alright girls.
Let's get this show on the road.
- We'll see you there.
- We'll wait till
the party starts
then we'll crash it.
- You should have stayed
down there the first time!
- I didn't forget about you.
We'll make it a twosome.
Now don't move
or bye bye.
- No, no.
Please don't kill us.
Please don't kill us, please!
Please no!
- The candle over here!
The candle, the
rope, for God's sake!
Pull me out of the way Dolemite.
Hurry!
- Are you alright Java?
- Oh yeah, thanks
to you Dolemite.
- Don't touch me there's a
live grenade between my legs.
- Be very careful
don't move, don't move.
- He keeps the key over
in his back pocket.
- Java, are you alright?
Mules have kicked me and
didn't even bruise my hide.
Rattlesnakes have bit me
and falled off and died.
Yes, I fought my way in here
cause I'm rough and ready,
so girls let's go and get that
motherfucking Cavaletti.
Hurry.
- Hurry Dolemite.
Let me at em.
- Hello, Captain.
Yeah, it's Pete here.
Yeah, I know about that.
Listen, hold onto your hat
and get a pencil and
pad to take this down.

make you blow your mind.
Yeah.

cause tonight is the night.
Come out here and you can see
some genuine American
Indian turquoise jewelry.
I got to sell this
shit and sell it quick,
I got to get outta town.
Wait a minute white boy

Wait a minute fool,

- Hey everybody.
Got a special surprise for you.
Cavaletti just hired a new
man, and he's one of the boys.
And for this evening's
entertainment,
he's going to demonstrate to us
how he became Central America's
champ at nunchuck sticks.
- Catering service here sir.
Where do you want this stuff?
Looks like you're having
a real nice party.
- Sure am.
Put the stuff in the kitchen.
Too bad you wasn't invited boy.
- Yeah it is.
- Say baby, let's you
and me go take a swim.
- I don't have a suit on sugar.
- Suit? It's a private pool.
- In that case, what

- Oh yes, she's one of my girls.
