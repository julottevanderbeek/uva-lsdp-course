Treasure Island
Did not appear
but
voiced the characters of:
Jim Hawkins, Billy Bones, Black Dog,
Blind Pew, Doctor Livesey...
...Squire Trelawney, John Silver,
Capt. Smollett and the pirates...
All the heroes of this sordid story,
from buccaneer to a hapless drunk,
will gather here in their pirate glory,
where Flint buried an old treasure trunk.
The tale begins with an old sea-chart.
To get it, quite a few will lay their bones.
A tiny island, peaceful as an orchard,
will end up scattered with tombstones.
The "Treasure Island"
Come and take a look, it's a pirate book.
The "Treasure Island"
by Robert Lewis Stevenson
The "Treasure Island"
On every other page,
fights in drunken rage,
Louis-d'ors and bullets sing their song.
There's fights with guns and rapiers
Intrigues, betrayals, chases, homicide!
And all of that for just a roll of paper
that has some sort of plan on it inside.
And all of that for money, money, money,
The root of all that's evil, as they say!
They come for me,
I thank you for the pleasure,
It's murder time, and I must run away.

Part 1: The Chart of Captain Flint
- Who's up at this time of night?
Mother always said: "At night, people
should sleep. And during the day..."
Who is there?
- This is a pleasant harbour.
Not a bad spot for a layover.
Not too crowded, is it, lad?
- Not very crowded, sir.
- Very well then, looks like a good
place for me to drop my anchor.
I'll stay here for a little while.
Rum, bacon, and scrambled eggs,
that's all I will require.
- Come here, boy!
If you see a sailor with only
one leg, call me right away.
For your trouble you'll get five,
no four...
three, three silver pennies,
once a month.
So, keep your eyes peeled.
- Yes, sir.
- Nice boy. Nice pl...
- Ladies and gentlemen!
You will now hear a sad but instructive
story about a boy called Bobby.
Who loved...
Who loved money.
Begin!
Our Bobby was jolly and kind little tot.
A hobby he had, he loved money a lot.
It was his soft spot.
All children like children,
no worry or care.
But Bob's on a diet, his table is bare.
He's saving the fare.
Money-shmoney, money-shmoney,
day or night you do your best!
Make more money!
Make more money!
And to hell with all the rest!
- Then what?
A penny, a shilling,
and then a whole pound.
Our Bob soon became
a con-artist renowned.
The word got around.
He wasn't alone, our poor little tot.
There's plenty of guys
who love money a lot.
He simply forgot.
Money-shmoney, money-shmoney,
day or night you do your best!
Make more money!
Make more money!
And to hell with all the rest!
- Dance, pop-eye!
- Ladies and gentlemen!
Please spare some change, if you can.
A.k.a "The Captain."
Owner of the chart of the Treasure Island.
Drinks a lot and always has a cold.
Nasty temper. Not married.
- Come here, my boy.
Is this for my friend, skipper Billy?
- Sir, I don't know any skippers.
This breakfast is for our tenant
who we call "the Captain."
- You could call my friend
"the Captain," too.
He has a scar on his face and very kindly
manners, especially when he's drunk.
So, this is where Billy lives?
- If you mean the Captain, sir,
then he's off for a walk.
- Oh, Billy will be as glad to see me
just as he would a good drink.
Speak of the devil, there he is.
Let's surprise him, shall we.
- Yes, sir.
- Billy! Don't you recognize me, Billy?
Don't recognize your old mate?
- Black Dog?
- That's me!
I wanted to check up on an old ship-mate.
- All right, since you
tracked me down anyway.
Spit it out, why are you here?
- Where's the chart, Billy?
We want the chart!
- What chart? I don't have any charts!
- The chart! Where is it?!
- I don't have any charts!
No! No! I won't!
Old friend of Flint's.
Seeks the chart of the Treasure Island.
Shady temper. Not married.
- More rum!
- You're injured, sir.
- Jim, my boy! Get me some rum
and then I'm out of here!
- Doctor! Doctor, quick!
- Hello there, I'm Doctor Livesey!
What seems to be the matter?
A very good and cheerful person.
Temper extroverted. Not married.
- Doctor, help! The Captain is injured.
- Injured? Nonsense! He just had a stroke
from liking rum too much.
All right, let's rescue this
total waste of human life.
Enlarged liver, very good!
Enlarged spleen, excellent!
Arrhythmia, just lovely! Very splendid!
- Where's Black Dog?
- Settle down! There are no dogs here.
Remember: if you don't stop drinking,
you will very soon die.
The words "rum" and "death" should mean
the same thing to you. Do you understand?
Good bye, Jim, my boy.
- Listen, Jim.
I must get out of here, and quick.
Otherwise they'll send me
the "black spot."
- What's that, sir?
- It's like a verdict, lad.
They're after my trunk,
and if they show up here...
Listen up, Jim.
If they show up here, then get on a horse
and get to that doctor.
He can then get the entire Flint's gang.
On board of the Admiral Benbow!
Get them all!
Old friend of Flint's.
Cunning and greedy.
Will do anything for money.
Atrocious temper. Not married.
- Could you tell this poor blind man,
who lost his precious eyesight...
...in the name of selflessly protecting
his motherland England...
...just where exactly he happens to be?
- Next to the Admiral Benbow inn,
in the Black Hill Harbour.
- I hear a voice. A young voice.
Give me your hand, young man,
and lead me into the house.
And now, boy, lead me to The Captain.
- Sir, I wouldn't dare.
- Won't dare, huh?
Lead, or I'll break your arm!
And when The Captains sees me,
yell "here's your friend, Billy!"
- Here's your friend, Billy.
- Oh, god. Pew!
- It's okay, Billy, stay where you are.
I can't see you, but I can hear
the trembling of your fingers.
Stretch out your right arm
and get it close to mine.
Now it's done.
Good bye, Billy.
Good boy.
- Good bye!
- The Black Spot.
Listen, Jim!
This Blind Pew is a dangerous man.
But the one-legged one who sent him
is even more dangerous.
Do not let him get the chart.
You hear? Do not!
It's in my trunk.
I alone know that place.
Old Flint himself gave me
that chart before he died.
The Black Spot. At 10 o'clock.
At 10 o'clock they'll come for my trunk.
That's 4 more hours.
That's all right! I'll show them!
We still have some time!
Fellow men of leisure,
Have a sense of measure.
Booze and endless drinking
lead into despair.
Our trip is risky,
Let's not mix in whisky,
Or we'll soon be sailing
straight into a snare.
Every extra jigger
is robbing you of vigour.
Your internal organs
get worse with every toast.
- Does it bloom like roses?
The liver from cirrhosis?
Keep it up and you will
soon give up the ghost!
Fifteen men on a dead man's chest!
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
Drink and the devil
had done for the rest!
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.
Drink and the devil
had done for the rest!
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.
And a bottle of rum!
Once the night is over,
Here comes  hangover!
You will not be happy
to see the light of day.
And your foes are happy
that you are feeling crappy.
In your trembling fingers
the weapons just won't stay.
Once the sun is out,
start with a workout!
Will be light as feather
any heavy load!
In a healthy body
spirit won't be shoddy.
Mind as sharp as arrow,
and the chest is broad.
Fifteen men on a dead man's chest
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
Drink and the devil
had done for the rest!
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.
Drink and the devil
had done for the rest!
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!
- Get the door.
- Yes, sir!
- Billy is dead!
- God rest his soul!
- Search him, you idiots,
then get upstairs for the trunk!
- Hey, Pew!
Looks like someone beat us to it!
- The trunk!
- The trunk has been opened!
- Is the chart there?
- Money!
- Money, money!
- To hell with money,
I want Flint's papers!
- Don't see any papers!
- No papers!
- We got robbed by the boy!
Too bad I didn't stab out his eyes!
Find him, lads, he can't be very far.
- We better get out of here, lads!
- Run!
- Run for your lives!
- Run? You idiots!
If you find those papers,
you'll be richer than kings!
- But we've got the gold, Pew!
- Run, run, lads!
- Dirk! Johnny! Black Dog!
You won't leave old Pew, mates!
A very, very good and polite boy.
Modest, kind, honest.
Listens to his mom and does his exercises.
Soft-tempered.
- Hello, Mr. Trelawney.
Good evening, Doctor.
- Good evening, my friend Jim!
What's the matter?
- You remember the old captain
that stayed at the Admiral Benbow?
Yesterday he was visited
by some blind tramp.
They talked, and then the Captain
had a heart attack.
This night some bandits, probably friends
of the blind one, searched the whole inn.
- What were they looking for?
- They weren't looking for money.
They were looking for this.
- All right, let's see. A chart!
A tall tree, North from
the Skeleton Island...
of the mountain.
But this is the map of Captain Flint!
Now we know where Flint
buried his treasure.
- Livesey, tomorrow I'm off to Bristol.
In three weeks...
no, pardon, in two weeks...
No-no-no, in ten days
we will have a ship.
And the best crew in all of England.
You, Livesey, will be the ship doctor.
I'll be the admiral.
And Jim Hawkins can be the ship's boy.
We will find the treasure. We will swim
in money and toss it into the sea.
Dumb, greedy, lazy and condescending.
A coward and a glutton.
No personality as such. Not married.
- Trelawney, I can go with you.
However, there is one person
in this affair that I find unreliable.
- Who? Pray tell me the name
of that scoundrel.
- You, Trelawney! You do not know
how to keep your mouth shut.
- Livesey, from now on I'll be
as quiet as a grave!
- Wonderful. To Bristol, my friends!
You can feel free to retort,
but at this point I must add
that if you play any sport,
that's a good lad, that's a good lad!
Bike, swim, or just run around!
Don't spend all day in your bed.
Get your behind off the ground,
and go ahead, and go ahead!
Every morning at the gym
Jim!
He can run and he can swim
Jim!
Even pirates of great height
will do poorly in a fight
For the pirates, they all drink
For the pirates they all drink
Gin!
Pick any sport of your choosing
Spend all your days on the court.
And the pirates with all their boozing
are bad at sport, are bad at sport!
Success only comes with perseverance
and staying on track.
A thousand voices will echo this back!
Every morning at the gym
Jim!
He can run and he can swim
Jim!
Even pirates of great height
will do poorly in a fight
For the pirates, they all drink
For the pirates, they all drink
Gin!
A.k.a. "Barbecue," a.k.a. "One-legged."
A nasty pirate, but feigns being nice.
Successfully.
Secretive. Not married.
- My good fellow,
we're off in search of treasure.
We need a good ship and a good crew.
- Sir, I can offer both.
- Wonderful.
- Just take a look at this beauty.
We're damned lucky!
Absolutely everyone, once they hear
that we're off to look for treasure...
...is doing their best to help us!
- He did tell everyone, didn't he?
That Trelawney.
- And here is our cook, Long John Silver.
I thought I found us a cook, but it
appears that I found us an entire crew!
They don't look very trustworthy,
but that's not a big deal.
I hope all is good and the schooner
is ready to leave?
- Pardon, sir?
Ah, yes! Just one thing, sir.
I will be honest with you.
I don't like this expedition.
I don't like these sailors.
And finally...
What?
Yes? No!
I don't like anything at all, sir!
- Is that all?
- I'm sorry, sir?
Ah, yes!
No, not all.
Even though I'm the captain, I never
asked about the purpose of this journey.
However, every last sailor on this ship
knows that we're going after treasure.
I don't like that at all, sir!
An old sailor and soldier.
Brutally honest, from which suffers.
Atrocious temper. Not married.
- Left, right, left, right, left, right!
Stop, one, two!
Attention! Hear my orders!
Cast off the stern and bow lines!
Raise the anchor!
Check the guff sail!
Check the topsail rigging!
Raise the sails!
Full speed... Ah, yes!
Full speed ahead!
- Tell me, Barbecue: how long are we
going to stand off and on like a bumboat?
I've had enough of the captain!
He's hazed me long enough!
I want to live in his cabin and...
- Hands...
Your head has no price on it because it
never had any brains. Do not rush things.
- But Silver, I...
- Quiet. I'm talking.
After Squire and Doctor find the treasure
and help us load it on the ship...
- What are we going to do with them?
- England would have left them
on some deserted island.
Flint or Billy Bones would have
cut them down like that much pork.
- Dead men don't bite!
- I vote... to kill.
- Land ho!
- This is our last chance!
It's not a payment in advance,
It always happens only once.
When fortune throws a furtive glance
That's your chance!
You may come close but no cigar.
And if you miss it, then you are
better of wishing on a star!
They are
sending the black spot,
sending the black spot
to me!
I got the black spot,
I got the damned spot!
Flee!
And when it is within your reach,
When you're almost filthy rich,
Somebody throws a hidden switch!
Rotten luck!
It helped you pick your sailing crew,
It fought and boarded ships with you!
It was behind you when you drew
your muskets.
But once you make your first mistake
You'll be a mouse before a snake,
And snakes don't give much of a break.
They are
Sending the black spot,
Sending the black spot
to me!
I got the black spot,
I got the damned spot!
Flee!
And when it is within your reach,
When you're almost filthy rich,
Somebody throws a hidden switch!
Rotten luck!
It made you rubber, not the glue
It stuffed your wallet thick for you
It was behind you when you drew
your muskets.
And when it is within your reach,
When you're almost filthy rich,
Somebody throws a hidden switch!
