- Oh, this is good.
- Oh, this... look at this one.
Oh, it's so timeless.
It's perfect.
Yeah, timeless, meaning you can wait
two or five years to wear it.
Don't be jealous.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't a young Barbra Streisand
and an old Betty White.
Where is Gay Cyclops?
Still trying
to stumble his way in?
We can't come here anymore.
Rachel, I, uh, brought
an engagement gift for you.
Hmm.
Whoa. Oh, whoa, whoa!
Oh, my God!
Oh, no, that is...
that is Photoshopped.
His thing is not that small
or... or brown.
And he could never fit
into those pumps.
Just think, from
now until eternity,
every time someone
Googles Finn Hudson,
they'll be treated to that
and dozens just like it.
That's the beauty of the Internet.
It stays with us forever.
What do you want, Sebastian?
I want a guaranteed Regionals win,
so I want you to drop out.
McKinley gets home-court
advantage this year.
You're going to come
down with Asian bird flu
or whatever Tina
Blowing-Wang just had.
But that is show choir
terrorism.
You give a bad name
to the entire gay community.
And you give the gay community
cutting-edge fashion
that's usually only seen
on Puerto Rican pride floats.
I'm sorry... I didn't hear you.
I was distracted
by your giant horse teeth.
You have 24 hours
to drop out, Rachel,
or I press the
upload button.
That's it. I'm done.
I'm leaving this classroom,
and I'm going to beat
that Sebastian kid's ass!
- Finn, chill.
- No, I'm not going to chill.
- I... I'm done chilling.
- The official show choir rule book
states that "any real
or perceived threat of violence,
"vandalism or humiliation
will be met with a swift
"and unquestioned
disqualification
of the threatening party's team
with extreme prejudice."
It's right here.
Page 72, by-law 15,
section six, article 44.
Guys, I contacted
the headmaster of Dalton.
Like you did when Sebastian
almost blinded me?
What did they do then?
Same thing as they're
going to do now... nothing.
Look, none of this
matters now anyways, okay?
We're not going to let him
beat us like this.
- I'm going to perform at Regionals.
- Even if he's going to post
a photo like this
of me if you do?
Finn, I'm not going to negotiate
with terrorists.
If someone posted a picture
like that of me online,
I'd probably kill myself.
Twice to be sure
I was dead.
Look, you guys are just going to have
to deal with things like this.
The more successful you get,
the more garbage
people are going to
make up about you.
They're going to love
to tear you down.
I can't believe
you would do that to me.
I'm going to be
married to you.
Don't you think I'm going to
suffer the consequences as well?
I mean, I just... I don't care
about stuff like that.
I love you, and we'll...
we'll manage this together.
Okay, the important thing
right now is that we win.
So you wouldn't care
if I Photoshopped a photo
of you like this
and put it on the Internet?
Look, our future depends
on us winning Regionals.
It'll help me
towards my NYADA application.
Hmm.
Hope you get in.
Finn.
- You wanted to see me?
- Q, have a seat.
Prepare yourself.
I'm about to drop a bomb on you.
I, Sue Sylvester...
am with child.
Are you serious?
Wow.
Um, that's amazing
and confusing.
- Who's the father?
- Oh, I can't tell you that yet.
But here's the deal.
In order for this zygote
to stay firmly ensconced
in my uterine wall,
my doctor has put me
on bovine hormones
that are making me
extremely nauseous.
They've also given me a
near-superhuman sense of smell.
For instance,
I can tell
that within the last week,
you either enjoyed
a delicious curry
or a hug from Principal Figgins.
Well, you know,
morning sickness is a good sign.
It means that the baby
is developing properly.
Well, it's good for the baby,
not so good for me.
Well, you know, there really
is no cure for morning sickness.
I mean, I ate saltines,
drank herbal tea
and sucked on lollipops.
That helps.
Lollipops?
Yeah.
Weird, but it works.
Well, thank you, Q,
for that condescending tone
and barely helpful advice.
I wanted to ask you a favor,
actually, Coach.
I would love
to rejoin the Cheerios!
I beg your pardon?
It's my senior year,
and I want to finish high school
in a Cheerios! uniform
with a national championship.
I mean,
other than Glee,
this was the rest
of my high school experience.
Well, I'm sorry, Q,
but that wouldn't be fair
to the girls who've been practicing
all year long, who didn't quit.
And if you'll now please
get the hell out of my office.
I just caught a whiff
of hot dog water
wafting in from the cafeteria,
and I think I'm going to blow
some serious chunks.
Excuse me.
You okay?
You seemed upset.
- And if Sebastian thinks...
- Forget about Sebastian!
I'm not mad at
you. I just...
don't want to waste
any more time on him.
I-I want to focus on winning.
I've got a new song
I want to try out.
The theme for Regionals
is "Inspiration,"
and I think this fits the bill.
You want to hear it?
Hey, Karofsky.
What's up, Nick?
â™ª Life's too short
to even care at all â™ª
â™ª Whoa â™ª
That's terrible.
â™ª I'm losing my mind,
losing my mind â™ª
â™ª Losing control â™ª
- You want to go? Huh?
- â™ª These fishes in the sea â™ª
- â™ª They're staring at me, whoa â™ª
- Homo.
â™ª Whoa â™ª
â™ª Wet world aches
for a beat of a drum â™ª
â™ª Whoa, whoa â™ª
â™ª If I could find a way
to see this straight â™ª
â™ª I'd run away â™ª
â™ª To some fortune that I â™ª
â™ª Should have found by now â™ª
â™ª I'm waiting
for this cough syrup â™ª
â™ª To come down â™ª
â™ª Come down â™ª
â™ª Life's too short
to even care at all â™ª
â™ª Whoa â™ª
â™ª I'm coming up now,
coming up now â™ª
â™ª Out of the blue â™ª
â™ª Oh â™ª
â™ª These zombies in the park â™ª
â™ª They're looking
for my heart â™ª
â™ª Whoa, whoa â™ª
â™ª A dark world aches
for a splash of the sun â™ª
â™ª Whoa, whoa â™ª
â™ª If I could find a way
to see this straight â™ª
â™ª I'd run away â™ª
â™ª To some fortune that I â™ª
â™ª Should have found by now â™ª
â™ª And so I run now to the things
they said could restore me â™ª
â™ª Restore life
the way it should be â™ª
â™ª I'm waiting
for this cough syrup â™ª
â™ª To come down â™ª
â™ª One more spoon
of cough syrup now â™ª
â™ª Whoa â™ª
â™ª One more spoon
of cough syrup now â™ª
â™ª Whoa â™ª
â™ª Oh. â™ª
We have to be
very careful about how
we deliver the news of this
to the student body.
David was part
of this community,
and he still has
many friends here.
And my understanding
is that these teen suicides...
or even attempts like David's...
can induce a string of copycats.
It's just so senseless.
Facebook,
Twitter, Tumblr.
The pressure to protect
your reputation
is so much worse
than when we were kids.
Yeah, and these people
can sling their hatred
and their mud
anonymously.
Sue, are you crying?
- Hormones.
- No, it's not hormones.
I could have done more.
I was principal when Dave
was having his trouble
with Porcelain, and...
I knew there was something
up with that kid. I knew it.
All I can think of
is his dad finding him.
Get some help! David, no!
Buddy, come on.
David!
And that feeling.
Guys, we were all hard on Dave.
We thought he
was going to hurt Kurt.
I just never thought
he'd hurt himself.
- It wasn't our job to know.
- Then whose job was it?
We should start today's meeting
by praying for Karofsky.
That he finds peace and
that he feels better.
I think we should
start today's meeting
by praying for his family.
They could use comfort
more than he could.
I just don't understand how
he could get to such
a horrible, dark place.
It's all over Facebook.
A couple of kids from
Karofsky's new school
saw him at Breadstix with
Kurt on Valentine's Day.
They posted mean
stuff on his page
and texted everyone
that he was gay.
- He couldn't take it.
- How is he?
- Is he going to live?
- Well, he's in the hospital,
but thank God his dad
found him in time.
I feel sorry for Karofsky,
but what he did
was selfish.
He didn't just want to hurt
himself; he wanted to hurt
everyone around him.
I went through the wringer,
but I never
- got to that place.
- Quinn, please.
Sure, you had a baby
when you were 16
and you had a bad dye job
for two weeks,
but seriously? The world never
stopped loving you.
And you're
going to Yale.
You have no idea what Karofsky
was struggling with.
You really want to try
to compare...
The despair, the
self-loathing.
It doesn't matter.
I just can't imagine things
getting so messed-up
that you would consider
taking your own life.
That is so harsh and reductive.
Have some compassion.
Do you know what they're still
writing on his Facebook?
"Better luck next time"
and "Try, try again."
Why are you even
here, Kurt?
Thought you didn't
believe in God.
He asked me if he could come,
and I invited him.
I heard you guys were praying
for Karofsky, and...
after everything
that we've been through,
I didn't have
anywhere else to go.
I feel responsible.
He asked me out, and...
I said no.
And he kept calling me...
If I'd just answered one
of those stupid calls...
We're taking a edible
arrangement to the hospital.
Do you want to come with us?
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Look, I've been thinking
about what Dave did,
and I just want you to know
that there's nothing
that anybody could do and there's
nothing that anybody could say about me
that would make me
want to do that.
Good, 'cause I don't ever want
to be without you.
So, I'm not gonna
perform at Regionals.
You have to. Look, I don't care
about these pictures.
I don't care about what anybody
says about me...
except for you.
Life's too short.
- What?
- Look, I don't want to wait
for some arbitrary date
to start living it, I...
I want to get married.
Now.
I have gym.
No, it's Saturday.
After we win Regionals.
Seriously?
Yeah.
Awesome!
But wait, what...
what if we lose?
Well, I thought we agreed
that I was singing.
Let me break it down for you,
from one bitch to another.
All this vicious,
underhanded crap
has got to stop.
Exactly.
That's why
I called you here.
First of all...
Blaine,
I am sorry about your eye.
That means
nothing to me.
Just give me a chance.
I have no excuses,
other than a lame prank got
completely out of control.
Second, the Finn photos have
all been destroyed.
I want the Warblers
to win fair and square.
And we're gonna take donations
for Lady Gaga's Born This Way
Foundation.
Win, lose or draw,
we're gonna dedicate our
performance to Dave Karofsky.
I thought you might
want to join us.
Wait for the punch,
you know it's coming.
No, not this time.
For too long I have treated
everything like a big joke.
So, how do you get
a guy to like you?
You, get a guy? Please.
Why, what's wrong with me?
First off, you're about
Quit waxing your eyebrows.
You look like Liberace.
In fact, just stay in
the closet, buddy.
It's all fun and games...
until it's not.
Mr. Shue, why do you have a jar
of peanut butter with one spoon?
Yeah, there are 15 of us here,
and I'm only comfortable
sharing a spoon
with about half of you.
Well, it's come to my attention
that our good friend Rory Flanagan
has never tasted peanut butter.
- What?!
- Are you serious?
- No way.
- It's not possible.
Rory, if you don't mind.
Oh, God...
Oh, my God...
That's the best thing
I've ever had.
Mr. Shuester, wow, that's
incredibly moving,
Yeah, Mr. Shue,
what's the point of all this?
The point is
Rory just had
a brand-new experience,
something as simple
as peanut butter.
You guys are young.
I want you to promise me
that, no matter
how depressed you get,
no matter how hopeless or alone
you feel,
you'll try your best to imagine
all of the amazing experiences
you have ahead of you.
Mr. Shue, look,
I know we're
a little dramatic sometimes,
but I don't think
anyone will ever consider taking
their own life.
I did.
Junior year.
That was a tough year.
I, uh, I cheated on
my math midterm.
Peeked at the answers
of the guy next to me and...
the teacher saw me do it.
Just 'cause you got caught
cheating?
I get caught cheating
all the time.
They called my dad
at his office,
and he was coming
to pick me up.
How was I supposed
to look him in the eye?
I just kept...
cturing my dad
so disappointed in me.
So... I walked up to the roof.
I went right to the edge.
One step and all the pain and
humiliation would be over.
Is that true?
That day, I promise you,
it felt like it was
the end of the world.
But you know what?
It wasn't.
You know, for some of you,
getting caught cheating
isn't a big deal.
But there's something...
everyone has something
that might take them up
to that edge.
And look at all the things
I would've missed out on.
I would've never met you guys
or Emma.
I would've missed out
on everything.
So, right now, I want you all
to think of something that
you're looking
forward to.
Big things.
Someday, I want to earn
enough money to buy
my folks a new place,
so they don't ever
have to go through
losing their home again.
I'm most looking forward
to meeting Rachel
Berry's children.
I want to be there to see
my kid's first steps.
I want to be there to see
Wow.
I'm sort of
embarrassed to admit it,
but I really do want
to graduate high school.
I'm gonna petition
the Army to change
my dad's dishonorable discharge
status to an honorable one.
I'm looking forward
to graduating
from Yale
at the top of my class.
I'm looking forward to the day
when my grandmother loves me again.
I want Lord Tubbington to kick
his Ecstasy addiction.
I am looking forward to marriage
equality in all 50 states.
I'm looking forward to the first
time I dance at Carnegie Hall.
I just want a song.
I'm looking forward to
watching my dad make
a difference in Congress.
I'm looking forward to being
friends with all of you
for the rest of my life.
I know this sounds silly,
and the peanut butter really
is amazing, Mr. Shue,
but do you know what
I'm looking forward to?
Winning at Regionals.
And now,
let's meet our judges
for the 2012 Midwest Regionals!
Deputy Zoning Commissioner
Melba Jackson-Wright!
President of the Ohio Plumbers
Union Local 109,
Mr. Harl Beindorf!
And Central Ohio's number one
late-night horror movie host...

- Svengoobles!

Just a reminder
to please make a donation
to one of our charity baskets.
We're set up all around
the auditorium.
Just look for the Dalton blazer.
Please... give what you can.

And now, from Our Lady
of Perpetual Sorrow High School,
the Golden Goblets!
â™ª Where thoughts â™ª
â™ª Serenely sweet express â™ª
â™ª She walks in beauty... â™ª
â™ª  â™ª
Those Golden Goblet madrigal
singers were way better
than I thought they'd be.
Are you high? I couldn't hear
their instruments at all.
All right, guys, listen up.
Don't let them get
into your heads, okay?
Stay focused on what we do best.
Show circle time,
come on, let's huddle up!
Okay, uh...
- Oh, Finn, you wanted to start us off?
- Yeah.
I know it's kind of
short notice, but...
after the competition,
Rachel and I are going
to get married.
At the Justice of the Peace,
at the Lima Municipal Center.
There will be some light
refreshments afterwards,
My dads and I were
rolling finger sandwiches
all night long.
With everything
that's happened lately,
we thought a lot about
what Mr. Shue said.
We didn't want
to wait anymore.
We just want to live
every day like it's our last.
So we wanted to thank a lot of
you guys that were supportive
of our decision to get married.
And-and for those of you
who maybe weren't the biggest
fans of our impending nuptials,
we thank you also.
So after we win,
we would really love it
if all of you would
come to our wedding.
Come on, bring it in!
A... mazing!
â™ª I came to win â™ª
â™ª To fight â™ª
â™ª To conquer â™ª
â™ª To thrive â™ª
â™ª I came to win â™ª
â™ª To survive â™ª
â™ª To prosper â™ª
â™ª To rise â™ª
â™ª To fly... â™ª
â™ª To fly... â™ª
â™ª Uh... Yo... Yo... â™ª
â™ª I used to think
that I could not â™ª
â™ª Go on... â™ª
â™ª I wish today, it would rain all day â™ª
â™ª Maybe that would kind of
make the pain go away â™ª
â™ª And life was nothing
but an awful song... â™ª
â™ª They got they guns out,
aimin' at me â™ª
â™ª But I become near
when they aimin' at me â™ª
â™ª Me, me, me against them â™ª
â™ª Me against enemies,
me against friends â™ª
â™ª Somehow they both
seem to become one â™ª
â™ª A sea full of sharks,
and they all smell blood â™ª
â™ª They start coming
and I start rising â™ª
â™ª Must be surprising,
I'm just surmising â™ª
â™ª I win, thrive, soar, higher â™ª
â™ª Higher, higher, more fire â™ª
â™ª I came to win â™ª
â™ª To fight â™ª
â™ª To conquer â™ª
â™ª To thrive â™ª
â™ª I came to win â™ª
â™ª To survive â™ª

â™ª Get ready for it â™ª
â™ª I believe I can fly â™ª
â™ª  â™ª
â™ª I believe

â™ª Spread my wings and fly away â™ª
â™ª I believe I can soar â™ª
â™ª Get ready for it â™ª
â™ª Get ready for it â™ª
â™ª I see me running â™ª

â™ª I believe I can fly â™ª
â™ª  â™ª
â™ª Get ready for it â™ª
â™ª I believe I can fly â™ª
â™ª I believe I can fly. â™ª
Come on!
Ohh... wah!
â™ª You know the bed
feels warmer â™ª
â™ª Sleeping here alone â™ª
â™ª You know I dream in color â™ª
â™ª And do the things I want â™ª
â™ª You think you got
the best of me â™ª
â™ª Think you had the last laugh â™ª
â™ª Bet you think
that everything â™ª
â™ª Good is gone â™ª
â™ª Think you left me
broken down â™ª
â™ª Think that I'd
come running back â™ª
â™ª Baby, you don't know me â™ª
â™ª 'Cause you're dead wrong â™ª
â™ª What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger â™ª
â™ª Stand a little taller â™ª
â™ª Doesn't mean I'm lonely â™ª
â™ª When I'm alone â™ª
â™ª What doesn't kill you
makes a fighter â™ª
â™ª Footsteps even lighter â™ª
â™ª Doesn't mean I'm over â™ª
â™ª 'Cause you're gone â™ª
â™ª What doesn't kill you
makes you â™ª
â™ª Stronger â™ª
â™ª You're stronger â™ª
â™ª Just me, myself, and I â™ª
â™ª What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger â™ª
â™ª Stand a little taller â™ª
â™ª Doesn't mean I'm lonely â™ª
â™ª I'm alone â™ª
â™ª Thanks to you
I got a new thing started â™ª
â™ª Thanks to you I'm not
the broken-hearted â™ª
â™ª Thanks to you
I'm finally thinking 'bout me â™ª
â™ª You know in the end â™ª
â™ª The day you left â™ª
â™ª Was just my beginning â™ª
â™ª In the end... â™ª
â™ª What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger â™ª
â™ª Stand a little taller â™ª
â™ª Doesn't mean I'm lonely
when I'm alone â™ª
â™ª What doesn't kill you
makes a fighter â™ª
â™ª Footsteps even lighter â™ª
â™ª Doesn't mean I'm over â™ª
â™ª 'Cause you're gone â™ª
â™ª What doesn't kill you
makes you... â™ª
â™ª Stronger, stronger â™ª
â™ª Just me, myself, and I â™ª
â™ª What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger â™ª
â™ª Stronger â™ª
â™ª Stand a little taller â™ª
â™ª Stronger â™ª
â™ª Doesn't mean I'm lonely â™ª
â™ª When I'm alone â™ª
â™ª Not alone. â™ª
â™ª We could just
go home right now â™ª
â™ª Or maybe we could
stick around â™ª
â™ª For just one more drink â™ª
â™ª Oh, yeah â™ª
â™ª Get another bottle out â™ª
â™ª Let's shoot the breeze â™ª
â™ª Sit back down â™ª
â™ª For just one more drink â™ª
â™ª Oh, yeah â™ª

â™ª Wish everybody well â™ª
â™ª Here's to us â™ª
â™ª Here's to us â™ª
â™ª We stuck it out
this far together â™ª
â™ª Put our dreams
through the shredder â™ª
â™ª Let's toast,
'cause things got better â™ª
â™ª And everything
could change like that â™ª
â™ª And all these years
go by so fast â™ª
â™ª But nothing lasts forever â™ª
â™ª Here's to us,
here's to love â™ª
â™ª All the times

â™ª Here's to you,

â™ª Here's to us â™ª
â™ª Here's to all that we kissed â™ª

I've crossed oceans of time
to bring the results of this
show choir competition.
In third place,
from Our Lady
of Perpetual Sorrow,
the Golden Goblets!
And now... the moment
you've all been waiting for.
The 2012 Midwest
Regional Champion
from McKinley High...
...the New Directions!
Coach Sylvester?
Quinn, thank you for coming.
I know you must be exhausted
from singing all those "oohs"
and background "ahs."
Have a seat.
I've been doing a lot
of thinking this week,
and, um, I don't know if
it's this Karofsky thing
or even seeing you perform,
but I realized something.
I always admired you, Quinn.
At first, I thought
it was because
you reminded me
of a younger,
somewhat less striking
Sue Sylvester,
but then I realized
that I admire you
for all the ways
you're not like me.
You proved that it's never too
late to turn your life around.
And with that in mind,
I'm giving you this.
You're not gonna regret this.
I'm gonna win us a national
championship in this uniform.
Hey, Fabray, looking good.
Thanks, boys.
Catch you later.
Hey.
How do I look?
Coach Sylvester gave it
to me earlier,
and I couldn't resist.
Well, I'm glad you're happy.
Everyone deserves to be happy.
When you were singing that song,
you were singing it to Finn
and only Finn.
Right?
He really does
make you so happy.
I want to support you,
Rachel, and Finn,
and come to the wedding,
if it's not too late.
Can I come in?
The doctors took me off
I get to go home tomorrow.
That's great.
I'm really happy
that you're alive, David.
Me, too.
I should have returned
your calls.
Why would you, after the way
I've treated you?
It's okay.
No, it's not
okay.
It's like you said
on Valentine's Day,
I made your life a
living hell for months.
But when the same
thing happened to me,
I couldn't even take
it for a week.
I suppose a best friend
telling me
he never wants
to talk to me again,
my mom
telling me
that I have a disease...
...and maybe I can be cured...
I don't know what to do.
I can't go back to that school.
Then go to another school.
I'm not gonna
lie to you, it...
it isn't gonna be easy.
And there'll be
some days when...
life just sucks.
But you're gonna get
through this.
'Cause I'm gonna help you.
And so is everyone else
who loves you
and accepts you for who you are.
And if they can't
accept that, then...
screw 'em.
Right?
Yeah.
This week, um,
Mr. Shue had us think
about something
we're looking forward to
in the future.
You want to give it a go?
I don't know.
Come on.
I'll help you.
Close your eyes,
and imagine what life
could be like
in ten years.
You're sitting
You're some kind
of successful professional.
A lawyer, maybe.
Could I be a sports agent?
Sure.
You're a big sports agent
living in the city
of your dreams
because you left Lima
and never looked back.
Your handsome partner comes
to visit you in your office
You're taking the rest
of the day off work
because you're taking your son
to his first football game.
You lean over to your partner,
and you say,
"I'm so happy right now."
You, uh...
you said last week you wanted
to be friends?
I'd like that.
Me, too.
I believe congratulations
are in order.
What do you mean?
You've never congratulated me
about anything.
Oh, I was
in the audience
at Regionals today,
and I thought the Glee Club
was just fantastic.
Now you congratulate me.
Why?
I'm pregnant.
Sue, that's incredible.
Wow.
Thank you.
Wait, what are you doing here?
Oh, I wouldn't miss Finn
and Rachel getting married.
I'm crashing.
I think you can win
at Nationals,
and I want to help you.
Are you serious?
I'm a proven champion.
I got some tricks up my sleeve.
What's the catch?
You know, I don't think
there is a catch.
I think I really
just want to help you.
- Isn't that weird?
- Mm-hmm.
Damn hormones.
Okay, could we just have
a show of hands
that we all still think
this is a crazy idea?
Okay, good, that settles it.
I'm pulling the plug.
Burt, calm down.
Calm down? Carol, our kids
are getting hitched...
we screwed up big-time.
We started playing
these crazy
reverse psychology games
with them,
look where we are.
The blame game?
- This'll be fun. Bring it, Burt.
- How did we screw up?
By raising two kind,
wonderful,
independently-minded children?
I agree with Burt.
They're in love, wunderbar,
but nowhere near ready
for this kind of commitment.
At least we're here.
The truth is, if we'd
come down hard on them,
they would have gone
behind our back and eloped.
Trust me, I know my son.
Okay? And once he puts
his mind to something,
there is no getting him
off of it.
Same with Rachel. At this point,
even Patti LuPone herself
couldn't talk her
out of marrying Finn.
- Barbara could.
- Maybe Barbara.
- Who's Barbara?
- Streisand.
But, since Babs
is probably shopping
in her private
underground mall right now...
you know she has her own mall?
Here's what we're gonna do:
When the Justice of the Peace
- says does anybody here object...
- Hell, yeah, I do.
We will all say, "We do."
â™ª With feeling. â™ª
Burt, you will run
interference with Finn.
Carol, you will distract
the Justice of the Peace
with your feminine wiles.
I will hustle Rachel
out the side door
and into our waiting car,
where you, LeRoy, will drive...
I don't drive...
straight to Broadway.
And if that doesn't
start to get our baby girl
back on her career track,
I don't know what will.
Are we agreed?
Sounds like a plan.
Wow, Rachel, you...
You just...
You look...
You do, too.
Ready to go in there?
Just-just-just hold on
just a second.
I-I just want to...
take a second just to...
remember this. Us.
Oh, it's Quinn.
Sorry.
"Ran home to get
my bridesmaids dress.
Be there soon."
Great.
Well, Miss Hudson-Berry,
everybody's waiting.
â™ª Goin' to the chapel
and we're â™ª
â™ª Gonna get married â™ª
â™ª Goin' to the chapel â™ª
â™ª And we're â™ª
â™ª Gonna get married â™ª
â™ª Gee, I really love you â™ª
â™ª And we're gonna get married â™ª
â™ª Goin' to the chapel â™ª
â™ª Of love... â™ª
Face it, Quinn's not coming.
She said she'd be here, okay?
I don't want to start
without her.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, we've got
five minutes.
Come on, let's go.
Whew!
â™ª Sky is blue, whoa-oh-oh â™ª
â™ª Birds all sing â™ª
â™ª As if they knew â™ª
â™ª Today's our day â™ª
Looking sharp.
Thanks.
- â™ª We'll say I do â™ª
- All right, come on.
â™ª And we'll never
be lonely... â™ª
Finn, out.
You can't see the bride
before the wedding.
I've already seen her.
But that's bad luck.
No, it's fine.
Rachel, we got to go right now,
or we're gonna lose our slot.
Could we please just wait
a couple more minutes
- for Quinn, please?
- It's now or never.
â™ª Gonna get married â™ª
â™ª Goin' to the chapel â™ª
â™ª And we're gonna get married â™ª
â™ª Gee, I really love you â™ª
If we're gonna do
something, do it now.
I'm gonna fake
an epileptic seizure.
You're not an epileptic.
- That's why I'm gonna fake it.
- Hurry up.
