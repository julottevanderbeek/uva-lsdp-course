Today's the last day of college.
A giR for you, from five of us...
...for being such a lovely teacher.

meanings in those lovely poems...
...and making us realize
that life is beautiful!
Thank you so much
for the flowers!
l wish to tell you...

Your views may differ
from theirs...
...l don't expect you to blindly

...but do listen to them &

Never forget...they love you!
Yes Mother!
For the farewell function today...
we've invited your parents too!
We plan to discuss a current,
hot topic with our parents today...
MARRIAGE !!
North, South, East or West...
Sophiya is the best!!
Respected Mother Fernandes,
teachers & dear parents...
...on behalf of Sophiya College,
we extend a warm welcome to all!
She's our daughter!
Today's topic is marriage!
Girls of our age are passing
through this phase now.
ARer marriage,
life is a pam for guys...
...they continue living with
their parents in their own space...
...and we girls...
We girls sacrifice our
career, family, likes, dislikes...
...toothbrush, toothpaste...
- manicure kits, body lotions...
...and other comforts
for an absolute stranger!
Even today, boys have an upper
hand in matters of marriage...
...and we're presented as
adorned dolls before them!
We're deemed fortunate...
ifthey accept us as their wives...
How funny...!
All dads are adorable!
l guess our moms present here
may not like to hear this!
But we too must've evey right
to choose our life partner...
...and these boys...
better feel obliged!
Ladies & Gentlemen...
A son is a son
till he gets himselfa wife...
But...a daughter is a daughter
all her life!!

With my mom wishing

...to hear her daughter's
wedding bells chime...
She works on a plan...

Did l like him...
she wants to know...
And all that my head nods...
is a definite NO!
For the boy,
who wishes to mary me...
l won't be a shy bride-to-be...
l won't smile to
have him impressed...
l won't camalk
in style for him...
l wouldn't care...

God help these girls!!
My dear...

ARer the demise of

They are vey nice & decent
people.
lf Sanjana becomes a part
ofthis family...it'll be perFect!
But they're so rich...

...and he'll arrive at Sundernagar
on the 26th.
That means, aRer four days...

He is a gem of a person...
Sanjana will be fortunate!
What else did Roopa say?
The boy is from a good family
& heads a big business abroad.
You girls ask too many questions!

What! What did you just say?
For the would-be son-in-law...
the one who's arriving...
...l mean your would-be husband!
Paro...come here...
Should your newly-wedded bride
be sent back to the village?
No...no...pardon me...!
Then, you won't arrange the flowers

Why can't we present ourselves
the way we are!
No! He'll be served evemhing

...and the flowers will be

...and you'll not utter a word
in front of him. Understood!
You mean, l shouldn't

you'll just smile!
How...?

Oh God!
Well l'm just saying what l feel...

Love & sex...
are a universal phenomenon!
l think we should always
talk about it...openly!!
Love is the starting point
of all life!

you're here because of love...
...and sex, mind you!
Oh my God! Look who's here!

Red shirt!
- The brown blazer guy!
Love divided by sex!
So your parents
approve ofthe boy!
Yes ma'am!
- And what about you?
What happened...confusion!
We're poles apart in our
tastes!
Do you know what he relishes...
''methi parathas''!!
His hobbies are
ice-skiing, river raRing...
...underwater diving, horse
riding!
l've never even tried
horse riding!
Then ty it now...!
Though your likes & dislikes
may differ...
...the most important thing is
how much he loves you!
And he loves you a lot...
...or else he wouldn't have been
waiting for you till now!
Look...
That red shirt, brown blazer guy...
isn't he the one...
...love divided by sex!
What's good...what's bad...
Iet your parents decide...
...you just feel the moment!
Go my dear...
...a treasure full of happiness
awaits you!
May l ask you another
guy kinda question!
lf l say...that a guy
couldn't go for work today...
...that he kept waiting
for his girl...
...to ask her several questions...
...to get to know her better...
...when she forgets something...
to always be there for her...
and...to take her into
his life...
...will she come with him...?

Hello sir!
Money talks...
May you live long...and

while talking to me?
Besides his weak eyesight,
he's squint-eyed too.
Offer the cake to almighty Prem!
This cake comes from the oven

Good evening sir!
Good evening ma'am!
How are you Mrs.Prem?
Have the kids gone to sleep?
Yes...they've school

Come darling!
Hey! We've an e-mail from Roopa!
Hello Sister!
Let me read it
my dear...!
Roopa must be eager to
know...
...whether Sanjana & Prem
have liked each other!
Listen, take the phone number
of Prem's mother from Roopa...
...we'll have to talk
to her too!
We'll fix an early
wedding date...
...your Let's think about it
attitude won't do!
What's Roopa written?
Prem Kumar had to detour suddenly
to Japan for some urgent work...
...that's why he didn't
make it to Sundernagar.
Now, he's reaching the day aRer.
What kind of a joke is this?!
Prem Kumar had to detour to
Japan for some urgent work...
...that's why he didn't
make it to Sundernagar...
...now he's reaching
the day aRer!
lf Prem Kumar's still to come...
...then, who's this?
Believe me...
there's no reason to wory!
Roopa must have
misunderstood...
...l'll call her up right away
& clarify evemhing!
Yes...call her up just now!
Bless you dear...
we got your e-mail...
Dad! We were on a vacation to
the West Coast for the past few days.
We never got to know ofthe
change in Prem Kumar's plan.
Only when we got back, did we come
to know about his trip to Japan.
He regretted that he
couldn't inform you earlier.
Now he's surely reaching
day aRer tomorrow.
What's the matter dad?
Well, the matter is...
- The matter is...
...that there's an impostor here
who's been posing as Prem!
What are you saying!
Yes! He's been staying with us
since mo weeks!
He's even attending
Prem's office!
ln short, he's taken Prem's place
in evey way...and...
...he & Sanjana have been spending
most oftheir time together!
Behave sensibly!
Tell mom not to wory!
l'll find out right away, who's
come in the place of Prem Kumar!
We're waiting for your
phone call!
Yes, ma'am!
- Open the store room!
Mr.Prem's room...?
- Yes!
Ma'am...
- You may go!
What are you doing?
- Searching through his belongings!
Tell me what's his name!
Prem Kishen!
That means in place
of Prem Kumar...
...a Prem Kishen has come here?!
lt's all your fault!
Without enquiring his full name...
you've broughtjust anybody home!
Good Lord! Who's he...
what does he do...
...where has he come from...
we've absolutely no clue!
And our daughter is out...
with this stranger...
...till mo in the night!!
O stranger...!
My stranger...!
O stranger...!
My stranger...!
O stranger...!
My stranger...!
Where have you come from...
...with so much love...
such abundance of love!
Where have you come from...
...with so much love...
such abundance of love!
How beautiful...
this stary night seems with you!
O stranger...!
My stranger...!
Once in a lifetime...
comes the season of love!
Once in a lifetime...
you lose your heart to someone!
ln the first flush of love...
...the heart makes a place
for someone...
...once and for all!
What's happening to me...
l'm on cloud nine!
O stranger...!
My stranger...!
This stranger has come
to steal your heart away!
This stranger has come
to take your peace away!
But, even this thief
will not find any peace...
...he'll be bereR of evemhing
before he leaves!
But where can he go...
...when he lives for you...
...he shall die for you...
...this stranger ofyours!
Where have you come from...
...with so much love...
such abundance of love!
Yes Roopa, tell me!
l found out evemhing...
...a boy named Prem Kishen
has come there...
...he's a business development
manager in Prem Kumar's company...
...and has studied with Prem Kumar
in the same college.
Prem Kumar has made the careers
of many of his college friends...
...by providing them jobs
in his company!
He's a great man!
As he couldn't make it himself,
he decided to send Prem Kishen.
An_ay, l've met this boy...
...he's come over to our place
many a time. He's a decent boy.
But he's the wrong boy!
Isn't he!
And your dad has been
singing his praises to Sanjana!
He's been encouraging them
to meet as & when they please...
...and Sanjana's lost
her heart to him...!
No mom...we have to
make Sanjana understand...
...that things have
already moved ahead!
ln fact, l've already spoken about
Sanjana to Prem Kumar's mother!
She has really liked
Sanjana's snaps!
That's why she's coming along
with her son to meet Sanjana!
What...? She's coming too...?!
Yes! Looks like Prem Kumar too
has liked Sanjana's snaps!
Please ask Sanjana to forget
whatever has taken place.
Rarely do we come across
such proposals!
Don't wory...l'll make Sanjana
understand evemhing!
Thank God, we've come to know
the truth at the right time!
We'll surely receive them
at the airport.
This time...l'll go myself!
Listen...what do you
intend telling Sanjana?
Nothing...!
You intend to hide the truth
from your daughter?
Look...
girls these days are a crazy lot!
lf Sanjana is told the truth...
...she will flatly refuse
to even meet Prem Kumar!
Let her meet Prem
Kumar unawares!
And just see...how she forgets
this impostor in a few days!
Prem Kishen too...
is a vey nice boy...!
Good Lord!
Have you lost your senses!
How can you compare
the status ofthe owner...
...to that of an ordinay
worker in his company!
Money isn't evemhing
in this world...
For God's sake, just keep quiet!
Now, this Prem Kishen should be
thrown out as soon as possible...
...l don't want him here
even for a moment!
Papa, you're still awake!
- There's no electricity...
Come on uncle...
l'll take you out for a drive!
No thank you. How was the pam?
- It was great dad! l'm so happy!
Get inside...change your clothes!
- Yes mom.
We've got an e-mail
from Roopa that...
...Prem Kumar & his mother
are coming here day aRer.
Boss is coming day aRer...
and so is ma'am! Wow!!
Aunty, there you are! Caught you!
Guess who's coming here day aRer!
Our company's boss &
his mom...!
You'll be vey happy
to meet them!
They'll stay at
our farmhouse...
...and you've got to take
good care ofthem! No excuses!
Where's Sanjana...!
- Good Lord! We're in a soup!
Out...l'm changing!
Shall l come in for a moment?
- Shut up! What do you want?
A vey important guest of mine
is coming here day aRer...
...but l'm leaving
for Delhi tomorrow!
So you'll have to attend to him...
show him around...
...and take good care of him...
Right?!

He's your guest...!
You take care of him!
ls that so!
Shall l come in?!
l dare you...!
You...?
- The zip is open...
Please let me see...

How dare you push me!

So, who's this
special guest ofyours?
Where do l begin...
He's my friend, philosopher & guide!
My evemhing! My all in all...!
Oh yeah!
Can we enter the love-birds' nest!
Hey! Didn't l send all ofyou
to eat ice-cream?
We've eaten ice-cream, popcorn,
wafers...evemhing!
Then sit here & learn...
aRer all you'll need training too!
What rubbish!
- Come on Ruby, click our snap!
Come on...it's time for thou
to bid farewell to thee!
Give him a long kiss!
Hey! Where are you offto?
Why don't you join us?
May l ask you

Why do girls wear such
cute nighties in the night?
What rubbish!
Love you Sanjana!
Take care of my guest!
Show him around!
lnvite him to
your cultural programme as well!
And do remember...to miss

And do remember...to

Your town is a lovely place!

with your arrival!
This is my younger daughter...
God bless you!

as Roopa described you!
That's my son...Prem!!
Yes, ma'am!
Mr.Johnny Singh,
why're you still in the car?
Please save me from
this commando!
Stop it, Johnny!
Quiet...!
Please step out...
- Yes!
No! l'm okay here!
Why's he barking so
much today?
Exactly! l just wished him
Good evening...
No...l said something more...
l said l'm Prem Kumar's P.A....
...l've come from America &
my name is Johnny...he lost it!
Dear Mr.Johnny...
his name is Johnny too!
He thought that you're
making fun of him! Please come!
Oh! He's Johnny too?
Johnny, please don't bark at Johnny!
Please have this aunty...
So you wish to study
Child Psychology?
Yes!
Oh no! She'll just get
married now!
This is rather unfair
on your part...
...evey girl has to mary someday...
...but it doesn't mean
that her wishes remain unfulfilled!
OK. Study as much as you wish to!
Have some ofthese
deep-fried snacks.
No please!
l'm already putting on weight!
No way! You're so slim & trim!
Go...call Prem Kumar for high tea!
Boss...high tea is served!
Boss...high tea is served!
Hey...high tea is served!!
Sory sir! Stupid Johnny!
Foolish Johnny! Idiot Johnny!
Doggy Johnny...!
Good Johnny! Happy Johnny!
Clever Johnny!
Sweet Johnny...
To hell with Johnny...!!
Sory!
There was a sudden change
in my travel plans to come here...
l'm sory, l couldn't inform you.
- That's okay!
l've brought you some ofthe latest
books on publishing business...
...perhaps they could be of some
use to you...just a second!
Hey Johnny! Buddy...
room partner!
Hey Prem...you old rascal!
l'm OK! You're fine...
just talk to boss!
Welcome to India boss!
Thank you...

from the airport...it's perFect!
You can go ahead!
Thank you sir!
Just see how swiRly
this project gets completed!
lt feels good to
hear your voice today!
Hmm...talk to mom!
Ma'am...Good evening!
This isn't right!
We're here...& you're missing!
Can't help it!
Boss gives us so much work...
...just get him married...
then he'll get busy at home!
This time l'll make sure...
that he agrees!
Good Lord! Why should you
bother about cooking!
As long as you're here,
you shall dine at our place!
Sory to interrupt you...
...whenever my boss is
with his mom...
...he relishes the food
cooked by her!
An_ay, he's an introvert...
doesn't pam at all!
Doesn't he hang around with friends,
or go to a restaurant?
He doesn't have a friend
to hang around with!
No friends...no enemies!
No indulgence...no desires!!
Prem Kumar seems to have
a vey gentle heart...
...l hope he comes for
Sanjana's cultural programme today!
He'll surely come...
l'll invite him personally!
Come in.
We've not been formally
introduced till now...
My name is Sanjana.

What do you mean?
Can't you see how deeply Sanjana
is in love with Prem Kishen!
l wish to...l need to...
l have to tell you something today.
Take me away...

One moment...
Ready to leave...!

How dare you party around with

Money Talks!!

of taking his place!

will trouble her hereafter...
l'll never be a barrier
to the happiness of this house.
Sir...!
Please...don't go, my dear...

No uncle...my conscience
doesn't allow me.
Uncle, you're vey lovable...

any love in his childhood!

Thank you dad!
My decision remains the same.

...you belong to boss.
He has a right over you.
lt doesn't matter...
who has a right over whom!
l've known him
only as your friend...
...that's all l know
about my relationship with him.
l've always seen you in him...
l've heard your name...in his name.
Why did you love me so much...
...that my heart is no longer mine!
l can't give you
all the happiness that...
l know where my happiness lies...
don't dissuade me!
None of us will be happy...
neither you, nor me...nor him...
...whom l won't be able to love...
...the way he'd be entitled to
after marriage.
This evening, the engagement date
is to be decided.
We should tell Prem Kumar's mother
evemhing about us right away!
Let's return all those gifts...
...that she's given me
with much hope & love.

Come on...
Ty to understand me...
You're too good a person, but it's
not about being good or bad...

or break someone's heart!

But where are you going...!
Do you've to leave for Delhi today...
...the meeting with the bankers

This proiect in Sundernagar
is our dream...
...l won't be at peace
till it's completed.
This evening we're going
to Sanjana's house...
...to decide on the engagement date!
We'll miss you!

...l'm sory!
Oh! Stranger...!
Dearest stranger...!
Oh! Stranger...!
Dearest stranger...!

The path of love...

Oh! Stranger...!
Dearest stranger...!
Call up Prem...

We're leaving for the engagement
ceremony right now...come soon!
Come soon, Prem!
Those moments of love...
...are just memories now...!
Oh! How do l fall in love...

Oh! Stranger...!
Dearest stranger...!
With whom do l share

Come back...
and take me into your arms!
With evey passing moment...
we're drifting apart...
With each moment...
l'm slipping away.
Please...even now...
come and take me away!
Oh! Stranger...!
Dearest stranger...!
ls this the time to come?
Sory!
There's a limit to being insolent!
What must Prem Kumar & his mother
be thinking?
You're engaged to him now...
how could you forget this!
What was this madness!
Do you know what the guests
are gossiping inside!
You've maligned the name of not only
our family but also theirs...
That's enough! Now no one's
going to say anything to Sanjana.
Uncle...
Our family name,
guests gossiping inside...
...don't matter at all!
All that matters is...
...what's in Sanjana's heart!
Tell me...what's in your heart!
You're free from evey bond...
...my other son...is right there...
Do you love him...
Saniana & l are well-matched
for marriage...
...we belong to the same community...
we've similar tastes...
...even our horoscopes match...
...but love writes
it's own destiny...
...or you wouldn't have come here
before me!
The one whom Saniana loves...
has a right over Sanjana!
We men may bow down
before wealth, name & fame...
...but it's said, that a woman
never does so!
You & Roopa have always
wished well for Sanjana...
...as a mother...as a sister.
Look at Saniana...once...
through the eyes of a woman...
...you will see
sheer honesty on her face!
Your daughter has chosen
a gem of a person!
Just one slap
was not enough for him...
...you hid the truth from me!
You rascal, you scoundrel!
Boss, l'll abuse him today...
Now you slap me...!
- Why...?!
Slap me, l say!
That's because...
...despite being a buddy, l didn't
hear the voice of your heart!
Hey you all! Welcome to
this year's Friendship Day bash!
Hey! You're late!
The last leg of the game is on!
Evey team out here
is making a hand painting...
...the team that finishes first...
is the winner!
Go Boss Go! Go Sanjana Go!
And we've won!!
Our special prize goes to...
the most compatible team...
...Sanjana & Prem!
And now Prem, it's question time!
lt's slightly personal...
but what the hell!
She is...his!
Hey there, my man!
l mean, she is his...
His wife!
Which means his beloved, sweetheart,
darling, his exclusive love...
...but...she is his!
And yet you love her?!
Yes, l do...
Do we have to possess someone...
in order to get someone's love?!
l haven't lost anything...
l too have found something...
in myself!
And as far as finding my beloved,
sweetheart, exclusive love...
...l've entrusted this task to her...
...now, she has to search...
a Sanjana for me!
Prince Charming...

Ruby...l love this!
Your comments please!
- Sure!
What do l say boss!
Vanraj Sahib, please help me!
