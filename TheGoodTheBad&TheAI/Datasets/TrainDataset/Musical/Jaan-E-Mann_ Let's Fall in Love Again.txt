Of course! Of course!
Why do you need a leave?
Sir, my car has broken down.
lts bonnet has broken.
Bonnet? Get out! Get out!
No need to hide your laughter, dear.
Very soon these tears of happiness..
..are going to be converted
into tears of sorrow.
No!
A notice had come today in the morning.
Of Piya's lawyer.
Ayear ago Mr. Suhan Kapoor and
Ms. Piya Goyal had divorced.
The court had declared that
every month on the 1st..
..the husband Suhan Kapoor
will send a cheque of 25,000..
..as alimony to his wife Piya Goyal.
But even after a year Suhan Kapoor..
..has not sent even a single cheque of
alimony to Piya Goyal.
Because of Suhan Kapoor's
carelessness Piya Goyal..
..had to undergo tremendous financial,
physical and mental stress.
Because it has been proved
that Piya Goyal..
..can't depend on Suhan Kapoor every month..
..so Piya Goyal demands
a one time settlement..
..of 50 lakhs as an alimony
from Suhan Kapoor.
You have one month's time to
repay the settlement amount.
Suhan! Suhan! Suhan!
Catch the ball!
Uncle!
l had heard that poison is
used to treat poison.
But shock is used to treat shock..
..l am seeing it forthe first time.
from where will l get 50 lakhs?
l don't have enough money to even pay..
..the telephone and electricity bill.
l have not paid my house rent
forthe past 3 months.
This has no connection with the law.
Law had decided the amount.
And you have not paid
a single penny to Piya.
But uncle, Piya doesn't need money.
l don't have work.
She should be giving me the alimony.
But when you got divorced,
at that time you had work..
..and Piya had no work.
Correct! Correct!
But now the tables have turned.
She has work.
That too in New York.
She is earning in dollars.
Uncle, l have no work.
So we have to go to the court
and re-evaluate this case.
And you will have to get me
the alimony. Correct.
Really? How much?
l think 50,000 per month is fine.
Why? You didn't like my idea?
Not at all! At least some time
take your work seriously.
This is a court case.
You have not given a single penny..
..to Piya in the past one-year as alimony.
lf you will go to the court,
then you yourself will get stuck.
Uncle, what should l do? l don't get any work.
Whatever money l had, l spent that..
..on bodybuilding and photo session.
Where will l get 50 lakhs?
Dear, you will have to arrange
forthe money.
Otherwise you will have
to rot in the prison.
l will not go to the prison.
lf l went to prison..
then my dream of becoming..
..a super star will be completely shattered.
l will somehow survive. But you won't.
l will think of a brilliant idea.
l could have never imagined!
l could have never imagined that
Piya would behave like this!
l don't know what have l done that..
..she is taking revenge from me!
She wants to send me to prison.
What is this?
l am showing you the flashback.
So that you will get a rough idea about my life.
People who live for love they are lucky.
People who die for love they too are strange.
My saga is precious. Beloved.
We are away and still we are near.
''l know..''
''Love is naive.''
''Heart tends to make mistakes.''
''Love is oblivious of patience.''
''l know that love is naive.''
''Heart tends to make mistakes.''
''Love is oblivious of patience.''
''l know that love is naive.''
''Heart tends to make mistakes.''
''Love is oblivious of patience.''
''Beloved.''
''Beloved.''
''Beloved.''
''Beloved.''
lf you had not given me the stupid idea..
..of eloping with Piya that night..
..then today my plight
wouldn't have been this.
l couldn't see your plight.
What did l know that Piya would
turn out to be like this?
She looked so innocent.
''What happened that is
the norm of the society.''
''Mom didn't agree.''
''Dad was angry.''
''That was the sign of my downfall.''
''This was the only style of love.''
''They became angry.''
''And we became rebels.''
''We were fervent and we escaped.''
bT
''l know that love is naive.''
''Heart.. - Tends to make mistakes.''
''Love is oblivious of patience.''
''Hey.''
''Hey.''
''Hey.''
''Hey.''
''Hey.''
''Hey.''
''Hey.''
''Hey.''
My hero? No, no.
Sir. Sir, did you call me?
Hold on.
The assistant said that you are married.
Yes, sir. The girl who had come
in the office with me.
Sir, she is my wife. Piya.
Your wife?
lf the public comes to know that
my hero is a married man..
..then who will come to watch my movie?
l'll lose millions.
lf l knew you were married,
l wouldn't have signed you.
You've to hide the fact
that you're married.
You've to stay away from your wife
till the film is released.
Okay, sir.
Are we going somewhere?
''l am worried about one helplessness.''
''You will be sad to know it.
But l am with you.''
''l will have to stay away from you.''
''lt's a matter of only a couple of months.
Please endure it.''
''My future, l swear on you.''
''My future is with Piya.''
''l know that love is naive.''
''Heart tends to make mistakes.''
''Love is oblivious of patience.''
bT
l'm ruined.
lt was my mistake to invest
money on you. Superflop hero!
''When l returned back defeated.''
''Back to my home.''
''Piya had already left.''
''She didn't even answer my call.''
''l wrote her letters throughout the year.
''But my voice didn't reach to her.''
''My Piya got lost somewhere.''
''l was hopeful that some day
she will also call me.''
bT
''l know that love is naive.''
''Heart tends to make mistakes.''
''Love is oblivious of patience.''
lt fell down.
Your story is very sad.
lt is very emotional.
Even today l don't understand
why she did this to me.
She ditched me at the time
when l needed herthe most.
Women are like this.
You can nevertrust women.
lf you have wealth and fame,
then women will hover around you.
And when you are in trouble,
they will leave you in a lurch.
l understand all these things.
There is only one thing
that l don't understand.
From where will l get 50 lakhs?
Friend, you don't worry about that.
You don't worry about that.
Because the one who has given hunger..
..He will provide you with food too.
Because the one who has given thirst..
...He will provide you with alcohol too.
And the one who has given alcohol,
he will give snacks too.
The one who has given the trouble,
he will solve it too.
We will surely find a scapegoat..
..from whom we will get 50 lakhs.
What scapegoat, uncle?
What scapegoat?
A scapegoat that has 50 lakhs.
Afoolish man who is willing
to give us 50 lakhs.
Afool who will dance to ourtunes.
Afool who will listen to
everything that we say.
An idiot who will do whatever we say.
But from where will we find
such a foolish and idiot person?
Excuse me...the back one.
Listen to me. Sell this house.
This house doesn't belong to my father.
l am a tenant. And forthe last 3 months,
l have not paid the rent.
How much will you get foryour old car?
l already sold it 3 months back for 50 lakhs.
You can't sell your house and car.
Do you have something to sell?
Uncle. -Yes.
How much will l get for my kidney?
Don't talk rubbish.
The one who has nobody, God is with him.
l don't say this. lt is written in the books.
Now only God can save us.
Let's ask God's help.
Help.
Help.
We don't have any other option.
First time l'm asking you something.
No other way too.
Send an Angel who will
solve all our problems.
Please! Please!
Let's see who has come.
Hi Guys. - Hi.
Like this l entered Suhan's life
as an angel.
What are you looking for?
-What are you looking for?
Piya. - Piya?
Piya does not stay here.
But the address says she is here.
Hold it. - Please help the child.
- l am not a child.
Excuse me. - l am sorry uncle.
She does not stay here.
She has been divorced.
Divorce.
Piya cannot go away like this.
How can Piya be compared to that guy?
Piya is anangel and that
man is a bloody animal.
lt's all my mistake,
l shouldn't have let her go.
l should have been with her.
God, don't know in what
condition she could be?
What? -Your introduction?
ls this a time for introduction?
Let us ask in English.
How are you bloody? Who are you?
Oh, l am sorry.
Actually sorry, l have stayed in the US
forthe past seven years.
And so my Hindi is not that... - lt's Ok.
Anyways, l am Agastya Rao from
NASA Houston Texas..
..United States of America.
And your Zip code? - Pin code?
F5176721
Let's be serious guys.
Yes, serious, serious.
l am sorry, after hearing the news..
..of Piya's divorce l became a bit Hyper.
l am sorry. - l can understand.
lts Ok, can you help me?
Tell me know where she stays.
Aunty contact number,
address, E-mail lD.. Anything.
She's gone. She's gone.
Where has she gone?
- New York! - New York!
New York? After seven years l..
..collected my wits and
came to meet Piya..
..and she is in New York?
And l have a surprise for her.
Should have called at least
before coming here.
This guy looks like an fraud to me.
Yeah. Sure.
How do you know Piya?
You are...?
My name is Suhan Kapoor.
Super Star!
This means you are the new owners
of this house. - Oh yes.
But the way you are asking questions to me..
..as if you know Piya very well.
As if you are her relatives, could be a brother
From yourtalks it looks like
you know Piya's family very well.
Yes. - ls it? - How?
No, l don't know Piya's family,
but l know Piya very well.
She was my girl friend. -What?
Yes, she was my sweet heart?
But, Piya's marriage was going
to be with some one else..
What did l tell you?
She was surely my girl friend..
..but l was not her boy friend. - Oh!
Actually, Piya was surely going to marry me.
But then she married that bull.
Have you seen him?
He looked like King Kong.
l had already said that
Piya can't be happy with that Gorilla.
She was a delicate doll,
and the guy was a hairy bear!
But you did not tell,
how did you know her?
How did l know?
Actually we studied together.
She was the love of my life,
my sweet heart.
Who's snap is this?
This is me and Piya.
That is the only one copy with me.
Keep it carefully.
That was the last time l saw Piya.
She was very happy.
l don't know how she would be now.
No son, don't say like that.
You were saying how Piya was
going to marry you.
Yes. lt is a long story.
lt will take lots of time.
You don't worry about time.
We have enough.
What do you say? -Yes.
l still remember vividly...
My first day in college.
E = mc2. l don't know
how that genius cracked it.
Amazing. Einstein, genius.
What's the time?
Ok, ok. l am going. Bye, bye.
Ouch! Hey!
Sorry..
Love at first sight.
l remember. The first day of the college.
My foot!
What happened, then?
Days passed away,
we started coming closer..
Me and Piya were like one.
Whatever class, chemistry,
physics.. we sat together.
Then, one day..
'Find your last years forms'
Sure, sure. Sure.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Who are you? What do you want?
Me, Agastya Roy. Your neighbor.
Always stay next to you.
Really? l never saw you before?
But l have seen you always. -What?
Your sister. She's calling you.
She's waiting outside.
Come here. Please pass my message..
- No. No.
Please.. - Ok, Ok.
Sir. l have one question, sir. -Yes?
Very good question, Agastya.
Go, go. Go.
Yeah, come in. You dropped your book.
Agastya! What are you doing?
lt was the first time l remember.
l mean.. l had sacrificed for Piya.
l'm performing in your
college tomorrow night.
Who will you come with?
Somebody has to accompany me.
You know l've psychological problem,
l can't see you with any other man.
Suhan, please, buddy.
Your concert, and how can l go alone?
Don't get jealousy. Okay listen to me.
l'll come with the man you suggest.
Come with him.
You've already floored too many here.
l don't expect trouble from this idiot.
Ok. Ok. - Sorry.
Even today when l think of that day..
..my ears start ringing.
My sacrifice didn't got wasted.
l was sitting alone on the steps and thinking..
Hi Champu. Oh my god! Are you crying?
No. There was something in my eye.
Take this. -What's this?
l am sorry, it was because of me.
No. Not because of you. Don't be sorry.
You are a friend. And in friendship,
you never say::
..sorry orthank you.
Friends are friends. Ok?
Oh Champu, you are so sweet.
Don't cry. Ok, listen.
Will you come to the rock-show
along with me as my date?
l would love to.
l would love to come.
Champu, you are late.
Sorry, l had gone to buy a new suit.
How do l look?
Wow! -At least look at it once.
Come on. Come on.
Get rocking. Super star!
''Say A O -A O.''
''A O. -A. O.''
l can't hearyou.
''Louder!''
bT
''Colour it, fly away, fly away.''
''Spread the net, fly away.''
''Colour it, fly away, fly away.''
''Spread the net, fly away.''
''Fly away, Fly away.''
''This love.. of mine, is not new.''
''Then why am l flying?''
''Because, colours in the eyes
it also brought me along.''
''lf you find a manof your choice, fly away.''
''Colour it, fly away, fly away.''
''Spread the net, fly away.''
bT
''l could take the lines of some ones palm.''
''lf some one wishes, l would treat him.''
''Listen to what your heart says.''
''And then fly away.''
''This love.. of mine, is not new.''
''Then why am l flying?''
''Fire. When it burns, does not extinguish.''
''On this heart, it comes and settles.''
''Love, if you find, then fly away.''
''Fly away.''
''Colour it, fly away, fly away.''
''Spread the net, fly away.''
''Colour it, fly away, fly away.''
''Spread the net, fly away.''
''Fly away, Fly away, Fly away.''
''Puts your hands together!''
''Do you want more?''
bT
After listening to such a sad story..
..my eyes water, and my throat is dry.
l will go and get tea.
Shall l get some thing foryou, Champu?
l am sorry.
l entered your character.
Shall l get something foryou, Agastya?
Yeah, l will just have a.. Bourn vita.
lts not Bourn and then Vita.
lt's Bournvita. Ok?
Come. Follow me.
What are you looking for?
Recipe for vita? - Shut up!
Found it!
What did you find uncle, 5 millions?
l did not find 5 million rupees,
but an idea to obtain it.
Now listen carefully. Section 25,
Under Hindu Marriage Act.
After divorce, a husband has to take care..
..of his wife's expenses,
unless she is married again.
Once your Ex-wife remarries..
..then her responsibility
passes to the second husband.
And you.. need not give money
towards expenses.
This means if Piya gets married to Champu..
..then we will get 5 million rupees?
Ok. This time nothing should go wrong.
As you wish. l am doing it foryou,
as being yourfriend and lawyer.
l was doing my duty.
Now it is your wish.
There is no loss, uncle? - No.
So.. what do you say?
As you wish.
l was thinking, we wont find a
better suitorfor our Piya.
So we should find a auspicious time..
..and get both of them married.
Even l was thinking the same.
You look, how things work out.
Take son. Bournvita foryou. - Thank you.
So son, what have you thought?
What will you do in life?
Nothing uncle. l'm thinking
of going back home.
But you know, l'm worried about Piya.
-You should be.
l don't know what condition she might be in.
Look son, whatever happens in life is for good.
Had everything been alright in Piya's life..
..then today you would be having
Bournvita with her husband.
You wouldn't be having Bournvita
standing here with him and me.
You wouldn't be having Bournvita.
What? - He hasn't got it.
He hasn't got it.
Son, you are having Bournvita with us here..
..because Piya has been separated
from her husband.
He still hasn't got it.
One second uncle.
Are you telling me about
Piya or Bournvita?
Hey shut up, shut up.
You haven't got it, l'll explain to you.
You.. l'll tell you.
Piya has been divorced.
Has been divorced. -Yeah.
That means she doesn't stay
with her husband.
That means she is alone once again.
You have come here after 7 years,
crossing the seven seas, why?
To have Bournvita.
You haven't come for Bournvita!
You have come because
you are destined to be with Piya..
..and Piya is destined to be with you.
You are made for each other.
Made for each other. -Yeah.
Really? -Yes.
Yes. She is only yours, only yours.
- Only yours. - She's mine?
Yeah, she's yours.
Your name is written on her.
Otherwise why would she have divorced?
Why? -Why would you come here
after 7 years? -Why?
Yeah man, that makes sense.
Of course, that makes sense.
Then why are you here having
Bournvita with us?
Why? - Here is her address, that she had sent
forforwarding her letters etc.
Take a flight to New York and after 22 hours,
Piya will be in your arms.
One second. But..
What will l do there?
Do we have to explain to you?
Yes you will. -Will l?
You wait.. l'll tell you.
This is magic. See.
''lt knows, it doesn't believe, it believes,

Hey guys, thank you very much.
You have opened my eyes,

You have made me feel that even..
..this could happen between Piya and me.

But l'm going to New York, forthe real one.

she likes or dislikes.
l hope l don't make a fool out of myself.
God has sent me to solve your problem.
lf this is not a miracle then what is it?
ln the same flight,
we are both going to New York.
And that too, not alone,
but sitting together.
Yeah.
l promise you.
l'll help you out.
Specially after hearing your
about your pining for her.
Really?
l have promised uncle that, until l..
..get you married,
l won't catch a flight back to Mumbai.
Promise.- Our mission started like this.
And then begun the biggest
con in the history.
l completely surrendered myself to Suhan.
He was my Godfather.
Excuse me sir, can you
guide me to this address?
The sweet little girl next door.
Piya. -Yes.
My neighbor.
You've come to the right
address young man.
She's right up there in
her apartment.
But why is the window closed.
She's probably sleeping right now.
You must be the brother
she's been talking about.
Her brother?
Probably.
Nice meeting you.
Hey guys.
''My love foryou is not new''
''But still why...?''
''l will make a house in front
of your house..''
''l will make my world..''
''ln my neighboring window,
there's a piece of moon..''
''lt is regrettable that it is..''
What are you looking at?
You have forgotten the
mission so soon.
Oh yes. Piya. Show me.
She is probably sleeping. - Okay.
You keep watching. Call me quickly
when she wakes up.
What happened?
What happened?
You were right.
She has grown so much in 7 years.
Behave yourself. - Sorry.
Relax. - Sorry. - Chill. - Sorry.
Just hold. - Right.
Have you gone crazy?
She looks like Piya to you?
Then who is she?

Father of binoculars.
Move. Let me see.
Why are you pushing me?
Hold this.
Amazing. - lsn't it?
Something will have to be
done about you.
Suhan understood l can't impress Piya.
So he changed my
personality just like him.
l am looking just like you, right?
Rock Star. -Yeah!
Sir, what can l get foryou?
An apple juice and wine.
- l'll have coffee.
Uncle! - Uncle?
How did you come here?
Who uncle and whose uncle.
Do you have a twin brother in lndia?
This small.
lf l am this big then
how can my twin be this much?
l don't have a twin brother.
l'll ask my parents...
Saw that. Absolutely identical.
He is uncle's carbon copy.
How is it possible?
-Why it can't be possible?
lt is written that there are
at least seven people in this..
..with similarface.
lt is all nonsense.
No it is not nonsense.
lt is a scientifically proven thing.
There are seven people
who look similar in this world.
And... -And?
Just a minute. That means that
there must be seven more..
..girls looking just like Piya.
l think l should be afterthem at least
l will get one of them. What say?
Do you love Piya's face
or her personality?
Both.
Then you forget all this
nonsense and concentrate..
..on the mission. - Ok. Tell me.
Today is the mission's first day
so we will do warm up today.
Listen, you do exactly
what l tell you to do.
Not a penny less or
not a penny more.
Otherwise the whole
mission will get ruined.
When Piya comes out of
her apartment..
..when you look at..
.. heryou react as if you have
seen her suddenly. - How?
Just show me once more.
Now l'll do it. Just look at me. - Ok.
You do wonderful false acting.
You should have been in Hollywood.
Now stop it.
Now listen further.
When she is walking ahead you'll..
..call her by her name.
Like this...Piya!
Piya! - Oh! My God!
Oh! My God! -You here?
You here? - How amazing!
- How amazing!
She will turn back and look at you.
Her air will fly in high speed.
Go my lion. My blessings
are with you.
You remember everything, right? - No.
What? - l forget everything
when l look at Piya.
You please come with me.
No! -Why?
Why? Why...Why? - No, why
