- Mr. Schuester!
- Yeah?
I went to the library
and I got some sheet music...
and I wanted to run some songs by you
that feature me heavily on lead vocal.
Thanks, Rach, but I already
got one picked out.
- Let me help you with that.
- Thanks, Finn. You're so chivalrous.
- Thanks. That's a good thing, right?
- Morning, guys.
- Hey, Mr. Schue. We're just learning some runs.
- Oh, yeah?
So it goes... ¶¶¶¶
- With the finger, huh?
- Pretty fly for a white guy.
Oh, thank you, thank you. Hey, don't be
late for rehearsal this afternoon.
- Okay.
- All right.
- Morning, Kurt.
- Buenos nachos, Mr. Schue.
Yeah. Come on.
Wait.
One day you will all work for me.
It was very, very nice of you.
All right?
- Oh!
- Oh, Will! Oh, gosh.
- Hey, Emma.
- Hi.
Hey. I wanted to thank you so much
for the advice you gave me the other day.
I mean, teaching here and coaching
Glee Club... It's where I belong.
Oh, it's no problem. I mean, it's what I do.
I give counsel and give guidance.
- I'm a guidance counselor.
- Yeah, you are.
- Oh, look. We match. Periwinkle.
- Yeah.
Get a room.
Miss Sylvester wants to see you
in her office, Mr. Schue.
- She doesn't like to be kept waiting.
- You got it.
- Hey, Sue. You want to see me?
- Hey, buddy. Come on in.
I just blasted my hammies.
Oh.
- Iron tablet?
- Uh...
Keeps your strength up
while you're menstruating.
- I don't menstruate.
- Yeah? Neither do I.
So, I had a little chat
with Principal Figgins...
and he said that if your group
doesn't place at regionals...
he's cutting the program.
Ouch.
You don't have to worry about Glee Club.
We're gonna be fine.
Really? 'Cause I was at the local library,
where I read Cheerleading Today aloud...
to blind geriatrics,
and I came across this little page-turner.
And turns out, you need 12 kids
to qualify for regionals.
Last time I looked, you only had
five and a half.
Here. Cripple in the wheelchair.
I also took the liberty of highlighting
some special ed classes for you.
Maybe you could find some recruits.
'Cause I'm not sure there's anybody else
who's gonna wanna swim over...
to your island of misfit toys.
- Are you threatening me, Sue?
- Threatening you?
Oh, no, no, no. Presenting you with
an opportunity to compromise yourself?
You betcha.
Let's break it down.
You want to be creative.
You want to be in the spotlight.
Face it. You want to be me.
So here's the deal.
You do with your depressing
little group of kids...
what I did with my wealthy,
elderly mother.
Euthanize it. It's time.
And then I'll be happy to offer you a job
as my second assistant on Cheerios.
You can fetch me Gatorade
and launder my soiled delicates.
It'll be very rewarding work for you.
You know what, Sue?
I politely decline your offer.
Glee Club is here to stay.
I believe in my kids.
I know you're used to being
the cock of the walk around here.
Offensive.
But it looks like your Cheerios are gonna
have some competition.
We're gonna show at regionals.
You have my word on that.
Have a good day.
We are in line to be
the most popular kids in the school...
- over the next couple years.
- Yeah. I know.
Prom king and queen.
Homecoming court royalty.
I am not giving up those shiny crowns
just so you can express yourself.
Look, you're making too big
a deal out of this.
Okay. Let's compromise.
If you quit the club,
I'll let you touch my breast.
- Under the shirt?
- Over the bra.
No, no. I can't.
I want to do Glee.
I'm really happy when I'm performing.
People think you're gay now, Finn.
And you know what that makes me?
- Your big gay beard.
- Look. I-I gotta go to class. Okay?
Just relax. Everything's gonna work out.
Eavesdrop much?
Time for some girl talk, man hands.
You can dance with him. You can sing
with him. But you will never have him.
I understand why you'd be threatened.
Finn and I have made a connection.
But I'm an honorable person.
I don't need to steal your man.
I have plenty of suitors of my own.
Every day Glee's status is going up,
and yours is going down. Deal with it.
- Awesome.
- Holla!
¶¶ Ah, freak out ¶¶
¶¶ Le freak, c'est chic ¶¶
- ¶¶ Freak out ¶¶
- Energy, guys! It's disco.
¶¶ Le freak, c'est chic
Ah, freak out ¶¶
- Good with the hands.
John Travolta hands. All right.
- ¶¶ Le freak, c'est chic ¶¶
- We're freaking out. Let's go.
- ¶¶ Freak out ¶¶
¶¶ Le freak, c'est chic ¶¶
- And up and out and down. Good.
- ¶¶ Have you heard ¶¶
- Good. Good. Good, guys.
- ¶¶ About the new dance craze ¶¶
¶¶ Listen to us
I'm sure you'll be amazed ¶¶
- ¶¶ Big fun ¶¶
- Whoa, whoa! Hell to the nah!
First of all, you try to bust my face again,
and I will cut you!
And, also, this song is terrible.
No, no, no. It's not the song.
You guys just need to get into it.
- No, it's the song. It's really gay.
- We need modern music, Mr. Schue.
I'm sorry, guys.
We don't have time to discuss this.
- We're doing this song this Friday
at the pep assembly.
- In front of the whole school?
Exactly.
They're gonna throw fruit at us.
And I just had a facial.
- I'll press charges if that happens.
- Guys.
I can't express to you
how important this assembly is.
We have no choice,
or the club is over.
I know you guys don't like this song...
but we took nationals back in '93
with "Freak Out."
It's a crowd-pleaser. Trust me.
From the top.
I'm dead.
My father always said you
become a man when you buy your first house.
since he burned ours down once
after a drunken fight with Mom.
Welcome to your little slice
of the American dream.
I have a question about the trees.
It's always been my personal dream
to cut down my own Christmas tree.
How many Christmas trees will we have
in the backyard?
And do they come in different colors?
Because, well, obviously
we're expecting a family.
I have a real sense
it might be a girl.
Still, I can't believe we're
actually doing this. It all happened so fast.
It all started when Terri's sister Kendra
brought her kids over for Sunday brunch.
Well, I just don't understand where
you're planning on putting the nursery.
- I know.
- Well, we have a second bedroom.
You are not giving up your craft room,
Terri. A mother needs her respite.
That craft room is the only thing
that's gonna keep you from going...
all Susan Smith on that little angel.
Postpartum runs in our family.
Where are you going?
Bathroom. All that bran.
No, you can't.
Kyle needs his inhaler.
Anyway, this conversation is over.
They're starting construction
on a new section of our subdivision.
You are not bringing my niece
or nephew home to this apartment.
When pigs fly.
Can I eat this?
This banister was made
by Ecuadorean children.
It's great, Terri, but there are
nine foreclosures on our street.
Why can't we buy one of those?
They're half the price.
I'm not raising my baby in a used house.
They're not clean.
Look at the sun nook.
Isn't it beautiful?
- Is it extra?
- Mmm.
The price in the brochure
is for the basic model.
Everything else is à la carte.
The grand foyer is an extra 14,000,
and the sun nook is an extra 24.
I'll let you two talk.
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Hmm.
We can't afford this.
We already did the math, Will.
All we have to do is give up Applebee's...
and we won't run the A.C.
for the first couple of summers.
Well, we certainly can't afford
the grand foyer and the sun nook.
I mean, if we bite off more than
we can chew, we'll lose everything.
You need to pick one.
Come with me. I'm gonna show you
something really special.
This is where our daughter
or gay son will sleep.
I thought maybe we could put
one of those mini pianos in here...
and you two could put on shows for me.
I love it, Terri, but we still
can't afford everything.
It's my very own Sophie's choice.
Fine. I'm gonna give up the sun nook
for the grand foyer.
But I really need
the polished door handles.
Think of our family, Will.
This is our dream.
I knew in that moment
that I would do whatever it took...
even if it meant getting a part-time job
to make some extra money...
Let's go sign those papers.
Yes!
- You need to call me before you dress yourself.
- Whatever. Whatever.
- You look like a Technicolor zebra.
- You're a hater. That's what you are.
- I look like I'm a part of it.
- You're trying to copy me.
- It looks like I planned it.
- If your hair was longer, you'd have curls.
All right, guys.
How about a little Kanye?
Sweet!
- For the assembly?
- No. We won't be ready in time.
We're still doing disco. But we can
fold this into our repertoire...
and it'll be awesome at regionals.
Communication is the foundation
of any successful music group.
If we're gonna succeed,
we need to communicate.
You guys said you wanted modern music,
I listened.
Mr. Schue, we'd really like
to not do disco at that assembly.
- Finn, you're gonna take the solo.
- What? No, I can't do the solo, Mr. Schue.
I'm still learning how to walk
and sing at the same time.
No problem.
I'll walk you through it.
- Ooh!
- Challenge.
- Hey, Mercedes, you know this?
- Oh, I got this.
¶¶ She take my money ¶¶

¶¶ We want prenup ¶¶¶¶
Yeah!
All right, just like that.
Ready?
- Rachel, did you just throw up?
- No.
You missed the toilet.
The girl who was throwing up
before me left that.
I tried, but I guess I just don't have
a gag reflex.
One day when you're older,
that'll turn out to be a gift.
Let's have a little chat, okay?
Rachel, bulimia is
a very messy, serious disease.
I don't have bulimia. I tried it
and failed and won't ever attempt it again.
- Okay.
- Grossed me out.
Okay. But I still want to talk about
the feelings that you had...
that led up to you wanting
to puke your guts out.
I want to be thinner.
- Prettier, like that Quinn girl.
- Mm-hmm. And, um, why is that?
Have you ever liked somebody so much
you just wanna...
lock yourself in your room,
turn on sad music and cry?
No.
¶¶ All by my ¶¶
- ¶¶ Self ¶¶
- By myself! I'm by myself!
¶¶ Don't wanna be ¶¶¶¶
Uh, but a boy crush, huh?
I know about that.
I mean, not now. It takes me back in the...
Like a long time ago, I knew about that.
You know what? You need to remember,
Rachel, to protect your heart.
I don't care who he is. If he doesn't like you
for the way you are...
If he's... you know, he's married
with a baby on the way...
That's not worth the heartache. You don't
want to compromise yourself for that.
Um...
Have you just tried
telling him how you feel?
He doesn't even notice me.
I see. Um... Okay.
Well, here's what I think.
Common interests
are the key to romance.
All right? So find out what he likes.
Then he'll see you in a positive way...
and maybe you'll end up doing something
that you never would have expected.
Would you like to tell
Principal Figgins and Mr. Schuester...
what I caught you two doing?
It just sort of happened.
I don't mean to be rude,
but I think she's overreacting.
You watch your tone, young lady.
Gay parents encourage rebellion.
There are studies on this.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
All right, tell me what happened, Rachel.
Finn was worried about having
to perform a solo at the pep assembly...
in front of his chromosomally
challenged friends.
I was immediately concerned
by his lack of self-esteem...
and made a creative preemptive strike.
Yeah, pretty much what she said.
You know, one of the amazing things
about being in the performing arts...
is that you can parlay it
into so many different fields.
Like Justin Timberlake...
He's a singer, but he also
has a clothing line.
And, you know, he makes things
like shirts and belts.
- Who's Justin Timberlake?
- It was a twofold plan.
We figured that with
the right marketing strategy...
we could pull from the entire student body
without having an assembly...
That copy machine
is for Cheerios use only.
I can't begin to fathom the damage...
you'd have done to the program
had you broken it.
- Hold on a second, Sue.
- I resent being told to hold on to anything, William.
I will not be treated like a second-class
citizen because of my gender.
There is a very clear bureaucracy
when it comes to photocopies...
and you seem to think that these
procedures don't apply to your students.
It is my strong recommendation
that both these students be hobbled.
- How many copies did you guys make?
- Seventeen.
- Okay. And how much does a photocopy cost?
- Four and a half cents.
- How about they just pay for the copies?
- I like this compromise.
Children, pay Ms. Sylvester,
and we'll let you off with a warning.
And, Sue, I'm sorry,
but I'll have to ask you...
to personally clean the congealed protein
shake off the photocopy room floor.
That's why we have janitors.
Sue, we're in a recession,
and concessions must be made.
I've laid off half the janitorial staff.
We all need to lend a hand.
Lady Justice wept today.
- I'm sorry about that, Mr. Schue.
- I'd like to get the flyers up...
- before lunch tomorrow.
- You know what, guys? I don't want to hear it.
Doing that song is gonna
kill any chance the Glee Club has.
- It's a terrible idea.
- I have news for you, Rachel.
Sometimes you have to do
things you don't want to do.
We're doing the assembly,
and you're not putting up those flyers.
Everybody loves disco!
It's official. I'm a dead man.
Look, I know you're nervous,
but you're really, really talented.
- Stop it.
- I mean, maybe it'll all be okay.
Do you want to practice
for the assembly tomorrow after school?
I can't. I got a Celibacy Club meeting.
Baby, I have some bad news.
A wealthy relative died?
- I don't have any wealthy relatives.
- Oh.
I've just been pounding the pavement
all week after Glee rehearsal.
I-I can't find any extra work.
That probably means no grand foyer.
Why can't we ever
be the ones to catch a break?
No, no, no. It's going to be okay, baby.
- I mean, we don't need a grand foyer to be happy.
- No. You know what?
I'm so tired of the compromising.
I want my grand foyer.
I want my dream house.
I work hard. I sacrifice.
I deserve it.
You know, we give and we give.
Do you think that the big shots
at Sheets 'N' Things care...
that I sell more personal massagers
than any other assistant manager?
No. Or do you think that those kids...
that they give a damn
that we go with so little...
choreographing those
stupid dance routines?
I mean, when does anyone
start giving back?
I thought you asked Sue
to clean up after herself.
claiming that her lupus made it
impossible to bend over a bucket of suds.
I've been here till 10:00 p.m. every night,
up to my elbows in Vamoose!
Any problem with me taking over
one of those nighttime janitorial slots?
I'll work at half salary.
The Celibacy Club is now in session.
Thanks to a school rule that says
we have to let anyone join the club...
we're welcoming a new member this week...
- Where are all the boys?
- Down the hall.
First half hour we separate...
then we come together to share our faith.
I'm still on the fence
about the Celibacy Club.
I mean, I only joined to get
into Quinn Fabray's pants.
to get together and talk
about sexual issues.
I think I'm gonna kill myself.
I'm serious.
We're bombarded with sexual imagery
every day... Beer ads, those short skirts.
I'm supposed to be
surrounded by temptation...
- Not be able to do anything about it?
- Are you kidding?
Those skirts are crunchy toast.
Santana Lopez bent over
in hers the other day...
and I swear I could see her ovaries.
God bless the perv that invented these.
Remember the power motto, girls.
It's all about the teasing,
and not about the pleasing.
- Oh!
- Back it up like a dump truck, baby!
So, how far does Quinn let you get anyway?
We grind, make out.
But how do you keep from arriving early?
Whenever I grind...
Cinco de Mayo.
It's not a problem for me, man.
Somebody once told me
that to keep from erupting too early...
you should think
of dead kittens and stuff.
But the only image
that works for me happened...
the day my mom took me out
to practice for my driver's permit.
Pretty good, honey.
Who says a father figure's necessary, huh?
- Driving's fun.
- Yeah.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, my God,
you killed him. What are you gonna do?
Let's pair up for
the "Immaculate Affection."
the noise makes the angels cry.
- You enchant me.
- Yeah.
- Just stop it!
- Take it. Ah, yeah!
- Finn!
- It must have hit my zipper.
You know what? This is a joke.
Did you know that most studies
have demonstrated...
that celibacy doesn't work
in high schools?
Our hormones are driving us
too crazy to abstain.
that there's no room
for compromise, we act out.
The only way to deal
with teen sexuality is to be prepared.
That's what contraception is for.
Don't you dare mention the "C" word.
You want to know a dirty little secret...
that none of them want you to know?
Girls want sex just as much as guys do.
I-Is that accurate?
- Will?
- Aaah!
I do S.A.T. prep on Tuesday nights.
Are you, um... Are you a janitor?
Aja... no.
Really? 'Cause you're dressed like
a janitor, and your shirt says "Will."
Um, Terri and I are
trying to buy a house...
and we're, you know,
struggling to make ends meet, and...
Would you mind keeping this between us?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, your secret's
completely safe with me.
Thank you.
Do you, um... Do you want a hand?
Oh... No. I-I'm good, really.
Really? Because I can see from here...
that you've used window cleaner
to mop the floor.
And, uh, that keyboard
is crawling in E.coli...
because I know for a fact Ms. Hoffmeyer...
doesn't wash her hands
after doing number twos.
I really admire you working
so hard for something you want.
Let's make a deal.
You're helping me with my problem.
How about I take a stab at one of yours?
Oh, no, I don't...
I don't have a problem.
You've been scrubbing
that pencil sharpener for an hour.
Well, I mean, I have...
I have a little trouble with messes,
but it's not like it's a problem.
Okay.
When I was a little girl, it was
my dream to work on a dairy farm.
- Really?
- Yeah. And when I was eight,
we finally visited one...
and after the tour
and the yogurt tasting...
my... my brother pushed me
into the runoff lagoon.
- What?
- And, um, ever since then, I've just...
I've had a little trouble
forgetting the, uh... the smell.
Have you thought about... I don't know...
maybe seeing someone about that?
Oh, no. It's completely manageable.
You know, I just... I take lots of showers
and I, um... You know, I don't eat dairy.
So it's...
I want to try...
- a little experiment.
- Oh, no.
No, I'm not really, um,
comfortable with... with that...
There.
Ten seconds.
New record.
It's late. I should, um...
I should be, um, going.
I officially call this meeting
of Glee Club in session.
- But Mr. Schuester isn't here.
- Mr. Schuester isn't coming.
I paid a freshman to ask him
for help with irregular verbs.
Ugh! I'm so sick of hearing you
squawk, Eva Perón.
Let her talk.
I have another idea for the assembly.
Can I, once again, stress my most strenuous
objections to this attempted suicide?
They're not gonna kill us... Because we're
gonna give them what they want.
- Blood?
- Better.
Sex.
Silence, children. Silence.
The toilets are broken again.
We are fixing the problem.
But let me warn you...
there will be zero tolerance
for anyone soiling school grounds.
We're not going to have
a repeat of last time.
- Mr. Schuester.
- Yea, Glee!
- Glee kids, hooray!
- Uh, hi.
Uh, when I went to school here,
Glee Club ruled this place.
And we're on our way back.
But we need some recruits
to join the party.
Now, I could tell you all about
how great Glee is, but, uh...
I think I'm gonna let some
friends of mine show you instead.
¶¶ Get up on this ¶¶

Yes!
Let me be the one to break the silence.
That was the most offensive thing
I've seen in 20 years of teaching...
And that includes an elementary school
production of Hair.
We've received angry e-mails
from a number of concerned parents...
many of whom thought that
their children were going to hear...
a Special Olympian speak
about overcoming adversity.
I-I really don't know what to say.
Well, let me help you out then.
My first thought was that your students
should be put into foster care.
But you're the one who should be punished.
I demand your resignation
from this school...
as well as the disbanding of Glee Club.
Now, hold on, Sue. The issue is content.
Those kids are talented.
And I have not seen
the student body this excited...
since Tiffany performed
at the North Hills Mall.
I took the liberty of calling my pastor...
to provide a list
of family-friendly songs...
Your kids can only perform these
preapproved musical selections.
But all these songs have either
"Jesus" or "balloons" in the title.
But there are also songs about the circus.
This egg is sunny-side up, Will.
You need new outfits.
I got several flashes of panty
from your group today...
and I'm not talking about the girls.
So, Sue, I'm cutting
your dry-cleaning budget...
to pay for new costumes for the Glee Club.
- This will not stand.
- Oh, Sue.
The dry-cleaners here are just as good
as the ones in Europe.
- Mr. Schuester, I'm so sorry.
- Do you understand what you did today?
You lied to me.
And you ruined our chances.
No parent in their right mind
is gonna let their kid join Glee now.
Oh, and, uh, here's a list of the songs
that we're allowed to sing.
Look, I know how much
you care about Glee Club...
and I understand why
you did what you did...
but I don't like the way you did it.
They're for Tulip-A-Looza.
It's a tulip festival down at
the Columbus Convention Center.
- It's supposed to smell pretty nice.
- That's really sweet of you...
but I have... a-asthma.
What are you doing?
Chasing a married guy.
I saw you playing house
with him after hours, Emma.
Look. I don't know a lot
about relationships.
Most of mine are short and
flame out once the sex goes...
but I do know you never want
to be the rebounder.
I'm a good man, Emma.
I'll treat you right.
I'll put up with all your crazy.
They can't fire me
'cause I'm a minority...
so I'll always be able to provide for you.
You could do a lot worse...
and in this town,
you're not gonna do much better.
Okay, I'm done talking now.
- Try it.
- ¶¶ La ¶¶
- Good.
- That was good.
- Okay, one more up.
- ¶¶ La ¶¶
- That was really good.
- Is that okay?
Yeah, it's like the holy grail
for a baritenor, so it's a good note.
All right, I'll start at the bottom,
and then we'll go up higher.
Can we take a break?
Singing kind of makes me a little hungry.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Lucky I prepared for that.
Wow. I was wondering
what that was all about.
- Want to sit?
- Yeah, yeah.
Absolutely.
I was wondering why you asked me
to help you with your singing.
You kicked butt at the assembly.
Well, this is my only chance to be,
you know, good like you.
You think I'm good?
Well, when I first joined,
I thought you were kind of insane.
You talk a lot more than you should,
and to be honest with you...
I looked under the bed and made sure
that you weren't hanging out under there.
But then I heard you sing.
I don't know how to say this,
but you touched something in me.
Right here.
Your heart's on the other side
of your chest.
Oh.
It's beating really hard.
You're cool, Rachel.
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah.
- Virgin Cosmos.
- Cool.
That stuff you said at the Celibacy Club...
That was really cool.
Thanks.
- Well, cheers.
- Cheers.
Cups are like the airplane cups.
Oh, you got a little Cosmo right...
You know, you can kiss me if you want to.
I want to.
What?
Oh, my God!
Did I do something wrong?
No, no. Um, I just gotta go.
Look, please don't tell anybody
about this, okay?
I don't want my baby to grow
an extra arm just because...
So, I want you to run
any and all tests you have.
- Trust me. You're clear.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
- Is it a boy or a girl?
Um...
Don't quite know how to put this.
- There's no baby.
- Did it fall out?
Uh, no. Uh, you're not pregnant.
- But I've gained 10 pounds.
- It's probably from eating.
I can see a chicken wing in there
that you must have swallowed whole.
You're having what's called
a hysterical pregnancy.
You want a baby so badly that
your body mimics the symptoms.
If you're meant
to get pregnant, it'll happen.
I have to say, I'm really surprised
you guys are trying out.
I'm sure you've read about this
in the school paper.
Finn and I have been
an item for a while now.
So what kind of girlfriend
would I be if I didn't support him?
Well, let's see what you got.
¶¶ Say a little prayer for you ¶¶
¶¶ The moment I wake up ¶¶
- ¶¶ Before I put on my makeup ¶¶
- ¶¶ Makeup ¶¶
- ¶¶ I say a little ¶¶
- ¶¶ Prayer for you ¶¶
¶¶ While combing my hair now ¶¶
- ¶¶ And wonder what dress to wear now ¶¶
- ¶¶ Wear now ¶¶
- ¶¶ I say a little ¶¶
- ¶¶ Prayer for you ¶¶
¶¶ Forever, forever ¶¶
¶¶ You'll stay in my heart
And I will love you ¶¶
¶¶ Forever and ever
We never will part ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, how I love you
Together, together ¶¶
¶¶ That's how it must be ¶¶
¶¶ To live without you
would only bring heartbreak ¶¶
¶¶ For me ¶¶¶¶
Let me get this straight.
You're joining Glee Club?
I'm sorry, Coach Sylvester...
but something is going on
between Finn and that thing.
You saw how it was
undressing him with its eyes.
Please don't kick us off the Cheerios.
Cease fire on the waterworks.
I don't want to hear it. I don't want to see it.
You know, Q. when I first
laid eyes on you...
I was reminded of a young Sue Sylvester...
though you don't have my bone structure.
But it wasn't until this very moment...
I saw how alike we really are.
You three are going to be my spies.
I need eyes on the inside.
We're going to bring
this club down from within.
And I'm gonna get my boyfriend back.
I don't care so much about that.
Hey, Emma. Guess what.
I found these new
disinfecting bleach wipes.
What do you say?
Boy's bathroom in the science wing? 9:00?
Will, what are we doing?
I mean, you're having a baby.
Um, and anyway, uh...
- I have a date.
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.
- Yeah. With who?
I'm gonna go to Tulip-A-Looza.
With Ken.
Bringing home the bacon.
You... You made dinner.
I thought you'd be asleep.
Well, I wanted to talk
to you about something...
so I made you chicken pot pie...
from scratch.
Terri, that's so thoughtful. I...
Yeah, you know, I've been
working so hard lately, some...
Sometimes I forget what I'm doing it for.
Family's what's important to me.
You and the little guy or gal on the way.
- I hope you know that.
- Yeah.
I'm sorry. What was it
you wanted to talk about?
I went to the baby doctor today.
- And?
- And...
it's a boy.
- Oh, my God. Terri, that's amazing.
- Yeah.
Oh, my God. Oh!
Uh, I want you to give up being a janitor.
- What?
- Yeah. We don't need a new house.
We'll turn my craft room into a nursery.
- It's a compromise that I want to make.
- Really?
Yeah.
You know, the only project
that I want to work on now is us.
I love you so much.
You're giving Quinn Fabray the solo?
That's my solo.
You made this happen, Rachel. You were the
one who wanted to sell sex at the assembly.
Quinn's audition song was
on Figgins's approved list...
- and frankly, she did a heck of a job singing it.
- You're punishing me.
Contrary to your beliefs,
it's not all about you.
Or, I've realized, about me.
Look, I screwed up too.
I'm as responsible for what you did
at that assembly as you are.
I should never have pushed disco so hard.
When we did it back in '93...
the disco revival was in its heyday.
It was cool. We had fun.
And that... That is what Glee
is supposed to be about.
If we're gonna succeed,
we both need to change our mind sets.
You're not always gonna be the star.
But I promise to do my best
to make sure you're always having fun.
We're on our way.
Can I use the auditorium later to practice?
Our neighbors are filing a lawsuit.
Sure.
¶¶ You look so dumb right now ¶¶
¶¶ Standing outside my house ¶¶
¶¶ Tryin' to apologize ¶¶
¶¶ You're so ugly when you cry ¶¶
¶¶ Please, just cut it out ¶¶
¶¶ And don't tell me you're sorry ¶¶
¶¶ 'Cause you're not ¶¶
¶¶ Baby, when I know
you're only sorry you got caught ¶¶
¶¶ But you put on
quite a show ¶¶
¶¶ Really had me goin' ¶¶
¶¶ Now it's time to go ¶¶
¶¶ Curtain' s finally closin' ¶¶
¶¶ That was quite a show ¶¶
¶¶ Very entertaining ¶¶
¶¶ But it's over now ¶¶
¶¶ But it's over now ¶¶
¶¶ Go on and take a bow ¶¶
¶¶ Oh, and the ¶¶
¶¶ Award for ¶¶
¶¶ The best liar ¶¶
¶¶ Goes to you ¶¶
¶¶ For makin' me believe ¶¶
¶¶ That you could be
faithful to me ¶¶
¶¶ Let's hear your speech ¶¶
¶¶ You put on quite a show ¶¶
¶¶ Now it's time to go ¶¶
¶¶ Curtain' s finally closin' ¶¶
¶¶ That was quite a show ¶¶
¶¶ Very entertaining ¶¶
- ¶¶ But it's over now ¶¶
- ¶¶ But it's over now ¶¶
¶¶ Go on and take a bow ¶¶
¶¶ But it's over now ¶¶¶¶
