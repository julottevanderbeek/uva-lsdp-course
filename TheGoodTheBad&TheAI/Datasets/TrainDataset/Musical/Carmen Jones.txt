And win that war,

One more to go

Send them along

- Hey, you.
- Me?
- Your I.D.
- My which?
Oh, I ain't here
to work.
- No? What for, then?
- I'm lookin' for a corporal na--
You can't see a genera/
without proper identification.
You've got to
have a pass.
- Where do I get one?
- From the security officer.
- Where's he?
- Securing himself in Washington.
Your corporal's liable to be
a brigadier time he gets back here.
Lift them up
and put 'em down
Lift them up
and put 'em down
Mark time
and lift your tootsies
Lift them up
and put 'em down
Marching all around
the town
Company, squad right
That means turn around
Wish that I was 21
Old enough
to tote a gun
I'd go and be
a soldier
They're the ones
that have the fun
Wish I was
a bugler man
Playin' in
the army band
I'd blow until I must
be playin' in the army...
Glad you could find
time to join us.
Hope we didn't
inconvenience you, Corporal.
Joe!Joe!
Wipe that smile
off your face.
Fall in!
Old guard,
present...arms!
Old guard,
order...arms!
Old guard,
fall out!
Cindy Lou!
Surprised to see me?
You can say that again.
Oh,Joe. I know
I ain't smart like you,
but if the way I feel
makes up for it,
then I is way ahead.
- How you been, honey?
- Missin' you. My ma said--
- She all right?
- Uh-huh.
When I got your letter,
she say, ""Cindy Lou,
you go seeJoe off.""
Would've come anyway.
Hey. Hey! Goin' to flyin' school's
nothing to cry about.
Either got to cry or bust.
I'm so proud of you.
- Come on this side and tell me that.
- Can't.
- Why not?
- Got no pass.
Just you watch.
Don't get into trouble
on account of me.
I never saw trouble
look better.
Hey, Corporal,
pass that civilian.
You're theJoe
she's looking for?
Nobody else.
- Why didn't you say you're his gal?
- All the way.
-
- Then you're responsible, all the way.
Hey, Dave, put away
my gear for me, will ya?
Thanks.
Congratulations,
Corporal.
That Air Corps
sure was smart in pickin' you
for officers'
flying school.
Hi, Carmen.
Hi.
Get a load of this
hip-swingin' floozie
rollin' around to work
in time for lunch.
Prune-puss,
you make sounds I don't like.
I'm tellin' the foreman
you is late again.
Do that, and I'll scratch out
the one good eye you got.
Carmen, go to Pastor's
with me tonight.
I can dance those
other guys off the floor.
T-Bone, you're too little
and too late.
I don't waste no time.
Dig me, baby?
You're wasting time
right now, Sergeant.
Wind's blowin' me
in another direction.
Ain't no use
arguin' with the wind.
Go with me instead
of playin' the field.
Pick out one. That'll release
the rest of them.
I won't pick out a man
And he won't pick out me
It don't go that way
You can't ever know
Where your crazy heart
Wants to go
Love's a baby
that grows up wild
And he don't do
what you want him to
Love ain't nobody's
angel child
And he won't pay
any mind to you
One man gives me
his diamond stud
And I won't give him
a cigarette
One man treats me
like I was mud
And all I got
that man can get
Love's a baby that grows up wild
Dat's love
And he don't do
what you want him to
Dat's love
Love ain't nobody's
angel child
Dat's love
And he won't pay
any mind to you
Dat's love
You go for me
And I'm taboo
But if you're
hard to get
I go for you
And if I do
Den you are through
Boy
My baby, that's
the end of you
The end of you
So take your cue
Boy
Don't say I didn't
tell you true
She told you true
I told you truly
If I love you
Dat's de end of you
You go for me
And I'm taboo
But if you're
hard to get
I go for you
And if I do
Den you are
through, boy
My baby, that's
the end of you
The end of you
So take your cue
Boy
Don't say I didn't
tell you true
She told you true
I told you truly
If I love you
Dat's de end
Of you
Gimme a chicken
sandwich.
When your lovebird
decides to fly
Dere ain't no door
dat you can close
She just pecks ya
a quick good-bye
And flicks the salt
from her tail and goes
If you listen,
den you'll get taught
And here's your lesson
for today
If I chase ya,
den you'll get caught
And once I got you,
I go my way
When your lovebird
decides to fly
Dat's love
Dere ain't no door
that you can close
Dat's love
She just pecks you
a quick good-bye
Dat's love
And flicks the salt
from her tail and goes
Dat's love
You go for me
And I'm taboo
But if you're
hard to get
I go for you
And if I do
Den you are through
Boy
My baby, that's
the end of you
The end of you
So take your cue
Boy
Don't say I didn't
tell you true
She told you true
I told you truly
If I love you
Dat's de end
Of you
I hear you're gonna be a flyboy.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
I hope if you gotta
use a parachute, it's one I made.
I'd like to toss a party for you
tonight at Billy Pastor's.
Give you a real send-off.
Pick me up at 8:OO.
We'll have ourselves a ball.
Sorry.
I got a date.
Honeybee, if you
change your mind,
you know where
to buzz me.
That girl's
mighty pretty.
Oh, I don't know.
She's what
the fellas back home
call a hot bundle,
I guess.
Yeah.
Looks like she's on fire
just for you.
I never lit it, honey.
How do I know?
'Cause
I got a girl.
But I live in another town.
I know what the fellas say--
if you got a gal
in another town,
you ain't got
no gal at all.
But you're not just
any girl, Cindy Lou.
There's nobody
in the whole world like you.
Nobody, except...
Except who?
My ma.
You talk
just like my ma
You even walk
just like my ma
And I know why
I'm stuck on you
It's 'cause I'm
just like my pa
-  Ahhh
-  I talk just like your ma
-  Ahhh
-  I even walk just like your ma
-  Ahhh
-  And I can see why you like me
-  Ahhh
-  'Cause you is like your pa
You's awful like
your
Pa
Let me tell you
What the Lord did
He made me live
next door
So we could
fall in love
The way my pa and ma
The way my pa and ma
Did
Is you
my Cindy Lou?
I is
your Cindy Lou
And I belong
to you
And I belong
to you
-  You is myJoe
-  I is yourJoe
-  I'm Cindy Lou
-  My Cindy Lou
And I belong
To
You
Cindy, suppose I was
to ask my C.O.--
Ask him what,Joe?
To write ""OK""
in triplicate.
And what if I found
the chaplain and said,
""Sir, orders for
a rush weddin'""?
There's no use waiting
till the war's over to get married.
I got
a 2 4-hour pass.
We can have our
honeymoon tonight.
But what'll our folks say,
us not getting married
in church?
What do you say?
You wait right here
while I go find the C.O.
You blabbermouth witch!
I told you if you told
the foreman on me, I'd--
Go back to that bad street
you come off of!.
Ha ha ha!
Break it up!
What's this?
A full net of catfish!
Bail her out
of that chute.
Who's responsible
for this?
Me!
Corporal!
Take custody
of that prisoner.
Prisoner?
Interferin'
with the war effort.
Destroyin'
government property.
You heard me.
Remove the prisoner
off that table!
You go for me
And I'm taboo
But if you're
hard to get
I go for you
Here. Give this
to the judge in Masonville.
Masonville?
The army can't put
civilians in jail.
Gotta leave that pleasure
to the other civilians.
But I got a 2 4-hour pass.
You had yourself a pass.
This is an emergency.
Sabotage maybe.
But, Sarge--
You don't take off
for flyin' school
till tomorrow mornin',
which leaves you all night
to take care
of the prisoner.
Here's
the formal charges.
Judge sure
to get it now.
Corporal...
do your duty.
Take me to town.
Request a five-minute pass,
respectfully.
What for?
Private reasons.
Request not granted,
respectfully.
In case you forgot
the manual,
you're responsible
for this military prisoner
until you dump her
into the lap of civilian authorities.
Now get going.
Carmen Jones

Hooray!
Somethin' wrong,
little gal?
He volunteered
to take Miss Jones to jail.
A long way to town.
What you figure
he got in mind?
Just shows you can't
trust no corporals.
Well, I trustJoe.
What's your rush?
The sooner we get there,
the quicker
we gotta bust apart.
Cut that out.
Get over where
you belong.
That's just
what I'm doing.
OK, honey.
Accelerate me
all you want.
The harder I get bumped,
the more of me bounces.
Sugar, you ain't gonna
take me to the cooler, are ya?
Can't do you much good
once I'm in jail.
What you say we drive to a place
I know on the edge of town?
I'll show you more fun
than you ever had.
You're goin' to jail.
Dere's a cafe
on the corner
Run by my friend
Billy Pastor
A spot where a man
takes a lady
When he wants
to move faster
Guess I'll go
and say hello to Pastor
How can a lady
drink alone?
How can a lady
dance alone?
No lady can
romance alone
I oughta have
a sweetie-pie
De one I had
I give the air to
I threw his toothbrush
out the door
Now that I'm free,
my heart is sighin'
I'm off the hook
and lookin' for more
Dozens of fellas
telephone me
All askin' me
to make a date
I'm holdin' out
for somethin' special
But I don't know
How long I'll wait
Where will I wind up?
Who'll I be true to?
Ain't made my mind up
Waitin' for you to
What you say,
brother?
What you say, boy?
Ain't it time
that we got away?
on the corner
See that you're
right in there pitchin'
'Cause I ain't
de kind of a mare
Dat'll stand
without hitchin'
Now you got your little filly
at the startin' gate
Got a little filly
who is rarin' to go
No, you don't.
I just want
to stretch my legs.
Well, stretch 'em
in here.
Boy, you's the roughest
of rough.
Won't even give me
a little break.
Sorry.
You're a prisoner.
You mean to say you're really
gonna take me to jail?
You won't be in
for long.
A minute's too long
for me.
I can't stand
bein' cooped up.
An order's an order.
Not here it ain't.
Aah!
Uh-uh.
That's no way
to get to Masonville.
I'd like to see the road
that can stop this baby.
You will, sugar.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ain't no use.
You'll only
get messed up.
Careful, honey,
you'll bust your gaskets.
OK, out.
Oop.
Boy, but you strong.
The way you pull me up
like I was nothin'...
Bet you're a good dancer,
ain't you, honey?
I bet we could have us
a lot of fun.
Now, if you'd ask
my advice,
you'd turn right around
and go back as far as
the railroad crossing,
then along the tracks
till you get
to Sanitobia,
which is my hometown,
where the train stops
for Masonville.
You're tryin' to trick me,
and I know it.
I wouldn't do that
no more.
Cross my heart.
OK, we'll do it
your way.
Now get goin'...
and don't try
nothin' funny.
Believe me now?
When we get
to Masonville.
Still don't
trust me, huh?
Guess I'll have
to work on it.
Hi, Willa.
Well,
look who's home.
Carmen Jones.
Say, ain't that a five-star
brigadier admiral you got?
Somethin' better.
This boy's gonna be
a pilot.
Really?
Let's see now.
Flyboy's gotta have
somethin' special for supper.
How about a nice
roast chicken?
Yeah. I like that.
Hi, Harry.
Hi, Carmen.
We got potatoes,
beets, carrots, corn,
and peaches
right off the tree.
Oh, peaches!
We'll eat in Masonville.
When's that train?
It ain't due
till the moon's up.
And this town's
the last stop for the moon.
Come on. I want to know
when that train comes in.
Not till 1 O:OO.
I got time
to cook you a supper
you won't ever
forget.
Thanks, Harry.
Thank you.
Oh, wait.
This is for you,
flyboy, for free.
Mighty kind
of you, but--
We'll accept.
Hello, Grandma.
How you feelin',
honey?
I brought a fella
home for supper.
Hi.
Grandma,
somethin' wrong?
Trouble comin'
your way soon.
What trouble?
Found a buzzard
feather...
under the doorstep.
Buzzard feather?
Just 'fore
you come.
She's tryin' to keep
the bad spirits off
with that pail of water
in the moonlight.
Let the old buzzard
flap his wings right over me.
Till he comes down
and gets me,
I got a lotta
livin' to do.
Don't tell me
you go for that junk.
Come on,
start the party rollin'.
Have yourself a drink...
while I get
supper ready.
Thanks,
but I don't drink.
Boy...
if the army was made up
of nothin' but soldiers like you,
the war wouldn't
do nobody no good.
Guess that's what I like
about you, though,Joey.
You ain't like the others.
Yeah.
You ain't like 'em
at all.
That little candy-faced gal
I seen you with in the canteen,
is she your steady?
Uh-huh.
How steady?
We're gettin' married...
soon as I get back
to the base.
So that's why you're
in such a hurry
to dump me off
in Masonville.
I'm right in the way
of your honeymoon,
but not for long.
Ain't no way
to get the mud off.
It's OK.
Good thing you're
gettin' married.
You need a gal to look
after you in the worst way.
I'll do it.
Only mess yourself.
Don't want to get
into trouble
with them army cops
in Masonville.
You'll never get
to flyin' school.
Bet when
the war's over,
you'll come home
with a chest full of medals.
And that gal,
what's her name?
Cindy Lou.
Yeah. She'll hand 'em out
to all your kids.
Better win
a lot of medals.
You and Cindy Lou'll
need 'em.
One every year.
No bunch of kids for me.
Not till I can take care
of'em real good.
Got that
all figured out, too?
I know I'm not goin' back
to the farm.
I'm goin' to school,
learn all about planes.
What you gonna do
when the war's over?
Parachute factory's
bound to close.
Comin' back here?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
I never figure
from one day to the next.
I guess
you don't have to.
You're sure to get
a husband in any town.
Married? Me?
Never.
Your shoes
need polish bad.
I do my own.
Not when I'm around.
Sure.
You'll get married.
I'll bet you have all those
kids you wished on me.
Not a chance.
Why not?
Ain't in the cards.
Look, you can't let that
spooky stuff trip you up.
The signs
never lie,Joe.
Just don't pay 'em
no mind, Carmen.
Gal like you--
there's nothin'
you couldn't get
if you aim for it.
How you figure that?
Just look at you.
You got a lot more
than other gals.
A lot more what?
Got your belt on
twisted.
I'll fix it.
What's the matter?
You still don't
trust me, huh?
Or don't you trust
yourself?
Carmen.
Carmen!
Sorry, honey.
Like / to/d you,
/ cou/dn't stand
bein'cooped up in jai/.
/ gotta be free
to come and go,
or /'d just die.
Don't hate me,Joey,
'cause / /ove you
/ike / /oved no man
before.
Prisoners...halt!
Left face!
OK, sit down.
Joe, honey,
I thought I'd never
see you again.
I tried,
and I asked...
They don't allow
no visitors
the first two weeks
in the stockade.
I'm sorry,
carryin' on like this.
I made myself promise
I wouldn't.
That's all right, Cindy.
How you been?
Waitin'.
Just waitin'
to see you.
Won't help none,
you hangin' around.
Go home to your ma.
You want me to?
I was just thinkin'
of you, Cindy.
Home's where you is,
Joe.
Are you all right,
honey?
How are they
treatin' you?
Fine, fine.
When you think
you'll get out?
Can't tell.
They'll still send you
to air school.
You'll see.
Truth is, Cindy--
I know.
Sergeant Brown told me.
But it don't
matter none.
I know you,Joe.
I know you're all done
with that gal.
Here,Joe.
Package for you.
Must be from my mom.
I wrote her to bake
something nice for you.
Time's up.
Prisoners,
fall in.
Left face.
Forward...
march.
Chow call.
Come and get it.
This flower that you
threw my way
Has been my friend
by night and day
I saw it fade
and lose its bloom
But still it kept
a sweet perfume
In my cell, through
every darkened hour
On my lonely eyes
lay this flower
And so I'd sleep
the whole night through
And dream of you
And dream of you
Then I'd wake up
with no one near me
And talk for
the jail walls to hear me
She ain't the best
They all the same
Like all the rest
She's just a dame
Then I told myself
I was ravin'
There was just one thing
I was cravin'
It wasn't food
It wasn't dough,
I guess you know
That it was you
You're
all I'll ever crave
And that's for true
I don't know anything
about you
I don't know much
about a shinin' star
Just know the world
is dark without you
That's all I know
I only want you
as you are
Carmen
I love
You
Thanks for the lift,
big oil man.
Goin' as far as New Orleans
if you want to help
the war effort, baby.
I got
my battle station.
Anybody here
ask for me?
The whole army,
that's all.
Hi, Carmen.
Hi. You know
who I mean.
No corporal by
the name ofJoe.
- Go, Mack!
- Go, Mack!
- Go, Mack!
- Go, Mack!
- Go, Mack!
- Go, Mack!
- Go, Mack!
- Go, Mack!
- Go, Mack!
- Go, Mack!
I'll tell you
why I wanna dance
It ain't the sweetness
in the music
I like the sweetness
in the music
Hmm, but that ain't why
I wanna dance
It's somethin' thumpin'
in the bass
That thump-thump-thumpin'
on the music
That bump-bump-bumpin'
on the music
Is all I need
to start me off
I don't need
nothin' else
Maybe I do
To start
Me off
Beat out that rhythm
on a drum
Beat out that rhythm
on a drum
Beat out that rhythm
on a drum
And I don't
need no tune at all
Beat me that rhythm
on a drum
Beat me that rhythm
on a drum
Beat me that rhythm
on a drum
And I don't
need no tune at all
I feel it beatin'
in my bones
It feel like
I know there's
Beatin' way down deep
inside my bones
I feel it beatin'
in my heart
And then I get
a kind of dream
And in my dream
it kind of seems
There's one big heart
in all the world
There ain't
but one big heart
One heart
In all the world
Beat out that rhythm
on a drum
Beat out that rhythm
on a drum
Beat out that rhythm
on a drum
There's one big heart
in all the world
Beat out that rhythm
on a drum
Beat out that rhythm
on a drum
Beat out that rhythm
on a drum
There's one big heart
in all the world
And now that heart
is beatin' fast
And that's a rhythm
I can dance to
I'm mighty glad
I got a chance to
With that one big heart
that's beatin' fast
Tomorrow mornin'
let it rain
Tomorrow mornin'
let it pour
Tonight we
in the groove together
Ain't gonna worry
about stormy weather
Gonna kick old trouble
Out the door
Beat out that trouble
on a drum
Beat out old trouble
on a drum
Beat out old trouble
on a drum
And kick his carcass
out the door
Beat me that rhythm
on a drum
Beat me that rhythm
on a drum
Beat me that rhythm
on a drum
And kick old trouble
out the door
Kick him out the door,
kick him out the door
Kick him out the door,
kick him out the door
Charlie,
give me a double double
on the rocks.
Hey,Jones gal.
Hi, Carmen.
How's tricks?
Slow, Frankie.
You still carrying a blowtorch
for that boy in the stockade?
I reckon by now
it ought to be so hot
you can send it
to the navy.
They could use it
to weld battleships apart.
That's how it is.
Husky Miller!
Frankie,
Husky Miller!
Thanks a lot
I'm sure
glad to be
To be where
I can see
So many
friends of mine
How've I been doin'?
How've I been doin'?
If you really
want to know the truth
I'm doin' fine
And only five on points
The rest was all K.O.
Jackson and Johnson
Murphy and Bronson
One by one
they come
And one by one
to dreamland
They go
How's it done?
You asked me
how's it done
I got a trainer man
Who taught me
all I know
Sure feels good to
have him in my corner
Hear his voice
a-whispering low
Big boy, remember
You must remember
Stand up and fight
Until you
hear the bell
Stand toe to toe
Trade blow for blow
Keep punchin' till you
make your punches tell
Show that crowd
what you know
Until you
hear that bell
That final bell
Stand up
and fight like hell
When you fight
out in the open air
In a patch of light
The ring looks
small and white
Out in the blackness
Out in the blackness
You can feel a hundred
thousand eyes fill the night
Cigarettes are blinkin'
in the dark
And makin' polka dots
around the baseball park
People are quiet
Then there's a riot
Someone throws a punch
And plants it
right smack on the mark
Someone's hurt
You kinda
think it's you
You hang across the ropes
That's all
you want to do
Then you look around
and see your trainer's eyes
Beggin' you
to see it through
They say,
remember, big boy
Remember
Stand up and fight
until you hear the bell
Stand toe to toe
Trade blow for blow
Keep punchin' till you
make your punches tell
Show that crowd
what you know
Until you
hear that bell
That final bell
Stand up
and fight like hell
Stand up and fight
Stand up and fight
And fight
Like hell
Three cheers
for Husky Miller,
the comin' champion
of the world.
- Hooray!
- Hooray!
Drinks for everybody
in the house.
Inform the gentleman
behind the bar.
Drinks on
Husky Miller!
Hello, Heat-Wave.
Introduce yourself.
You talk like
you know me already.
I noticed you right off
up on the balcony.
Did you notice me?
Why, no.
You was actin'
so bashful,
I didn't hardly
know you was there.
You talkin'
to the champ.
He looks at a chicken,
and she's down--
Shut your teeth.
Excuse my dust,
gentlemen.
The air's getting mighty
unconditioned around here.
What are you
getting paid for,
to manage me in the ring
or K.O. me with the dames?
This chick needs
a big investment of time,
which you is mighty short of,
with the train waitin'.
It don't leave for an hour.
It's waitin'
at the station.
Remember, you promised the trainer
OK, I ain't going to
break no promise to him.
But you listen to this
and listen good.
When I wake up in Chicago
tomorrow morning,
I want to see Heat-Wave
on the platform.
Suppose she don't
want to go to Chicago?
That's your toothache.
If you can't
show up with her,
find yourself
a new meal ticket.
Good night, all!
- Good night!
- Good night!
Hey, what's he mean,
go find yourself a new meal ticket?
He means I don't eat.
And, brother,
if I don't eat, you starve.
Come on, Myrt, let's go
where the money is.
I believe we had
this parking space reserved,
but don't get up.
Please don't.
Don't these gentlemen look
like they met us someplace before?
I'd swear I met them
with Husky Miller.
Where you
know Husky from?
Maybe New York,
New Orleans.
What you doin' in
this hamburger joint?
Passin' through.
Then you don't know
nobody in here?
Who you
want us to know?
Her.
