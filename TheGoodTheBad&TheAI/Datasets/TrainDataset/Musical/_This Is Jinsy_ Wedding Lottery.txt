"Residents of Jinsy,
stand by your tessellators"
"Now is the time to sing, sing, sing! "
"Daily greet."
This address goes out to all 792 residents
of our island that we doth calleth Jinsy.
I, Arbiter Maven,
hereby announce the 129th wedding lottery
by order of our noble leader,
The Great He, Jinsy Praise Him.
Jinsy Praise Him. Praise Him.
Put the film on, Sporall.
It's wedding lottery time again on Jinsy.
"Place your belongings in
the gender crates provided."
"Say goodbye to your
current partner."
Goodbye. Goodbye.
"On wedding lottery day,
Mr Slightlyman, master of balls,
will use the latest
faceball technology
to randomly select
your new breed pair."
"Then it's off to your new chalet
for the next three happy cycles."
"Remember to take your faceballs
to the Wedding Barn by..."
You know, Sporall,
forcing strangers to marry
really is one of the
island's finest traditions.
Along with nose hurling, sir.
Oh, I forgot to mention. The Great He,
Jinsy Praise Him... Praise Him.
..thought it would be good for
PR if one of US got married.
Congratulations, sir.
I'll get you a present.
Of course, being an arbiter,
I'm immune from this marital bingo.
You're not thinking about putting
me in the wedding lottery? No, no.
Not thinking. I already have.
Don't look so shocked, Sporall.
You might end up with Miss Jinsy.
She's quite a catch.
"Attention, all residents."
"Due to an influx of electric
owls across the island,
residents are instructed not to leave
their chalets after lights out."
"When startled, the owls emit
a reflex-action photocopy
in either A4 or A5,
depending on the age of the bird."
"At 6 and 3 gov clock last night,
Br Bray-o was nearly blinded
when an electric owl
clung to his head
and photocopied his
face repeatedly."
"If this happens to you,
contact Jerry from Printi-Printi
who will try to prize
the creature off."
"Or at least change
the cartridge."
I'm trying to work.
That's a carrot.
I wonder who you'll end up with.
What? In the wedding lottery. Oh.
Cyril Hench, the accurate groper.
Wet-nose Pete.
Dingly-dangly Darren.
Sporall, when you speak,
it's like words committing suicide.
Thanks. There goes another one.
"Arghhhhh!" Pffff!
Anyway, I know the man I want.
He's got curly hair, a big nose
and claps twice
when he enters a room.
Isn't she wonderful! I could almost...
The new version-four tessellator.
I'm going to wire one
up in the Wedding Barn
so the island can watch you in full...
medium definition.
Move away. Splendid, splendid!
Oh, is the screen touch-sensitive?
I'm wiping your spit off.
Do I really have to get married?
I'm used to my little routine at home.
Yes. It's decided.
Here's your faceball.
Let's have a quick word with Mrs Goadion.
Yes, I've suffered from
terrible wind all my life.
I wouldn't mind, but every time
it happens, it sounds remarkably
like the first three notes
of the Jinsy national anthem.
Really? Everybody in the room
stands up and starts singing.
Hang on. Yes?
Mrs Goadion, have you washed
my ceremonial leotard?
I think she must have done it on the
wrong temperature. No, it's perfect.
What man would not be moved to tears
to slip into this robe of office?
Showing off his full
credentials to the island?
Hello. And welcome to Punishment
Roundup for Twosday 24th.
First of all, Mr Cooshay,
chalet 156.
At 4 to 6 gov clock,
he did cut hedges at Druid Field
and left brambles and messy
cuttings in the lane.
So that's not good.
- Punishment
- suspension of dance vouchers for 23 nights
and a mild electrical.
Fire.
Call that a performance?
You're washed up. You're history.
I'll make sure you never
work in this industry again.
Oh, and, Tomelia, wipe your nose.
Go on, get out of here.
I can't bear to look at you.
Cheer up, Sporall.
It's only marriage.
Alright, you lose your freedom,
your personal space, half your income...
Daily greet. Daily greet.
Oh, Arbiter Maven!
I didn't recognise you. You look so old.
Like a spider's done webs on your face.
You should try Winkleman's Prink Parlour.
Seriously, lip clips, refreckles,
nosebenders, tummy tailers.
They can reduce your joofers.
Oh, look at that.
See these eyelids here?
You see them? Do you?
They're made from my earlobes. Seriously.
If I close my eyes like this,
I can't hear a thing.
Can we just get on
with the rehearsal?
See? Nothing. Shall we get
on with the rehearsal?
Now this is the button you need to press.
Dressing room's through here.
Has this been sanitised? Sporall,
remind me to bring my wipes.
Cooee! I'm waiting.
Come on, old man.
Oh, the swan of wedlock.
Bring it in, bring it in.
Right, let the old man through.
Goodbye.
What an awful person. Lovely skin, though.
See you! Bye-bye.
How's he made so much money?
Bare-knuckle boxing?
Oh, God, that hurts my throat.
I'm glad you say that,
because no one ever mentions that.
Even a little one hurts.
What you up after lunch?
I might go to the corrugated
roof and run along it.
I really like the tippy-tippy noise
my feet make. I might do that.
Not interested in a
round of golf, then?
No. I've never been good at golf.
Oh, what's your handicap?
I haven't got any arms, for a start.
Ah, Mr Maven. I've brought
the wedding paperwork
up from the law caves
for you to sign.
Stay on the mat. You're dripping!
How are things in the law caves,
Trince? Pretty damp.
My new desk is directly under a stalactite.
It drips. I suppose you're
looking forward to the lottery.
Probably pleased to get rid of your
current wife. Show him the picture.
She's a good cook.
Couldn't you get takeaways?
Get back on the mat!
Of course, one will never know
the enforced intimacies
of the marital lottery.
I mean, it's a wonderful system.
It's just a great shame
arbiters can't take part.
Trince, wasn't Arbiter Jenkins married?
That rings a bell.
Arbiter Jenkins... Hm, I'll look into that.
Sparky! Sparky?
Sparky!
Arbiter Maven, you really do
have a very full head of hair.
Unfortunately,
it's on my desk.
I just need temporary tightening, really.
Especially my cockerel shaker.
What I'm going to do is
take a piece of your buttock
and I'm going to put it here.
It's not part of the procedure.
It's just for a bit of fun. Oh...
I'll pop it back later.
Oh, do you want me to reduce your joofers?
Um... Yes, alright.
Course you do.
Oh!
Argh!
"Now a quick look at recent deaths
across the island in The Singing Obituaries
with Fook and the Girl."
Gerry Mony choked
on a green bean
Mrs Feek was hit by kite
And Terry Booger isn't dead but
he really, really hit his head
We don't think
he'll last the night
Daily greet, Sporall.
Daily greet, sir. I've just been -
Argh, your face!
You're like a melted wolf.
Just a bit smoother.
Argh! What have you done?
Mr Maven, I've been
going through -
Your face! Did you fall in a fire?
Stay on the mat! You're dripping!
Sporall was right.
Arbiter Jenkins WAS married.
Only very old arbiters are
immune from the lottery.
But I AM old.
You don't look it, sir.
So, there's no reason
why you shouldn't be married.
Oh, it's The Great He, sir.
Welcome to the wedding lottery.
Are you shocked?
I can't really tell.
"Now, time for Sandy's Choice,
a talent competition judged by a dog."
Oh, I met her on a Onesday
And I had my dog with me
As she sat down and chattered
Well, it honed in on her knee
And it went
licky-licky-licky-licky-licky-licky
Licky-licky-licky-licky-licky on her knee
On her knee
I met her on a Twosday
when my dog was feeling ill
I tried to make it better
but I gave it the wrong pill
And it was
sicky-sicky-sicky-sicky-sicky-sicky
Sicky-sicky on her knee
Repeatedly
I didn't meet her Threesday
cos she said she couldn't come
So I sat at home all evening
and watched my doggy lick his...
Bum, bum, bum, bum-bum-bum,
bum, bum-bum-bum bum
It went
licky-licky-licky-licky-licky-licky
Licky-licky-licky-licky all night long
Bum-bum bum bum
And it went
licky-licky-licky-licky-licky-licky
All night long
Bum-bum bum bum
Bum-bum bum... Get in your bed!
Really licky.
Oh, thank you, Sandy.
Oh. Thank you.
Ponies and posies,
ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-poop
Ponies and posies... Sporall,
this is terrible.
Can you imagine ME married? Yes, I can.
Stop, enough, go. You make me sick. Go.
Mr Maven! Oh! Didn't recognise you.
You look fantastic.
Ow! Oh... Argh!
Who did you? Was it Tony? Yes.
Yeah. He's so good at the geriatrics. Come.
Sporall! What's he said about me?
Who? Big nose, curly hair.
Oh, you mean Maven? That's why he's
put himself in the wedding lottery.
So that he can be with me.
I, er... That's why he
asked me to give you these.
Really?
And then he asked me to
take them back again. Oh.
And then to stroke you gently like this.
Flowers in the face?
I wonder what that means.
It must be some kind of romantic code. Hmm.
That's so soft and...
OK, that's less...
less romantic now.
Alright, Sporall,
I get the message.
Some of us have got work
to do round here, you know.
That's a cucumber.
I know. It's my lunch.
What's your name? Sporall.
Who do you want to marry?
Come on, I haven't got all day.
What are you talking about?
You give me money and I
put you with who you want.
Who do you want?
Oh, right. Um...
Soosan Noop.
Thank you.
Yes? Actually, can I arrange
one for someone else as well?
Name. Arbiter Maven.

Gentlemales and ladyfabs,
welcome...
to the 129th wedding lottery.
I'm Mr Slightlyman, the master of balls.
Bring on the swan of wedlock!
Do the wave, Sporall. Wave.
More smoke, Steve.
And now Arbiter Maven will read
the declaration of wedlock.
Stay back. You're dripping. Sorry. Sorry.
I, Arbiter Maven,
as representative of
the people of Jinsy
do promise The Great He, Jinsy Praise Him,
that we will abide
by the results of
this honest, just
and completely random lottery.
Get off. Will you press the button
and release the faceballs, please?
Wipes... Wipes, Sporall, wipes.
I haven't got any wipes.
Do your arm, then. Push the button.
Push it.
And our first couple tonight is...
Joon Speep.
And...
Davivid Flume.
They won't get on. He drinks like a fish.
And our second
couple tonight is...
Dagrid Ugershott.
And...
Melnie Bock.
He bats for the other team.
What? Sportsman?
Did they do your joofers? Shh.

What? Yeah.

And the 189th couple
who will share their marital

Arbiter Maven... Looks like a melted wolf.
With? ..with...
..Miss Jinsy.
Arbiter, Arbiter! Give me a kiss.
As our ceremony reaches
the halfway point...
..I will now ask Arbiter Maven to
slip into his ceremonial leotard
and make the wedding speech.
Ponies and posies,
ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-poop
My leotard!
What's all this money?
Get her off me! Get her off!
Quick! Sporall! The swan!
Come on!
Can't this thing go any faster?
Come on, faster.
Look out!
Go on, go and get him.
Get him!
Oh... Oh!
Help me, help me!
It's a nice day
Except for the raining
It's a lovely day-ay-ay-ay-ay
Except for the raining
Bop-de-be-bap-da!
Pellay!
Just think, Mr Slightlyman and his friend
have been rigging the
lottery all this time.
Still, the punishment booths at
Rintels Point should sort them out.
It's a shame the lottery
was cancelled, sir.
You and Miss Jinsy would've made a
smashing couple. Don't be ridiculous
She's one of the most hideous
women I've ever laid eyes on.
How am I going to get rid of her?
Just tell her you're not married.
We're not married, dear.
Get ready, sir.
She's quite a catch.
Oh, fare diddly-well, my Jinsyo
We'll see thee on the morn
I strum my six-string bandlebar
I blow my withered horn
Oh.
Oh, I met her on a Onesday
And I had my dog with me
As she sat down and chattered
Well, it honed in on her knee
And it went
licky-licky-licky-licky-licky-licky
Licky-licky-licky-licky-licky on her knee
On her knee
