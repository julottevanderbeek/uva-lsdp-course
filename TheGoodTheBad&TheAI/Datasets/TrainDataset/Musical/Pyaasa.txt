These smiling flowers
These fragrant gardens
These world filled..
..with glorious colors
The nectar intoxicates the bees
What little have l
to add to this splendor..
Save a fear tears a few sighs
I told you to
keep the place tidy.
If that manuscript was here,
then where has it got to?
What do you know then?
- He wished you good morning.
Fool! I mean about
the manuscript?
You've looked at my things?
Wings?
This is a newspaper
office, not a birdhouse!
Wings, indeed!
Things, Have you read
the poem I left?
I have.
Did you like them?
You'll publish them?
Why should l?
I haven't lost my mind.
Call this gibberish poetry? It's
a crusade against unemployment.
Poetry deals with delicacies.
You must write poems about love.
You are incomparable, Sir!
Write about intoxications..
..the beauty of a cup,
or a fine woman.
Shut up. You don't write poetry.
Have you read poets
like Mir and Momin?
Yes, and Josh and Faiz too, who
are beyond your comprehension.
Give me my poems.
- We will find them later.
What do you think
you're doing, young man?
What right have you
to throw away my poems?
Should I make a
paper hat of them?
Don't insult them by
wearing them on a hollow head.
My head? Hollow?
How about yours?
If you're a poet, I'm a donkey!
Its clear and its
nice to hear you admit it.
Are you weighing
vegetables or gold?
There's uncle Vijay!
I've caught him
I'm not your enemy.
Why run from your mother?
Where have you been?
I can't bear to see your suffer.
I'm well; mother.
Sure you are.
Just look the state you're in.
Come home. I've hidden
away some good food for you.
You've found him? - Yes.
Well, mother.
So your poet is home!
Every literate
fool thinks he's poet.
Where else can he
get food as a parasite?
Take no notice of them. Eat.
See? We earn and mother
feed delicacies to her lay about.
He's shameless.
If he had any self-respect,
he'd starve rather than eat here.
Shut up, you two! I won't
hear a word said against him.
He's back after so long, and
you can't bear to see him eat.
He's hale and hearty. Why
doesn't he earn and not burden us?
He is your brother. His father
died, you should look after him.
It wasn't our wish that our
parents produce such a lay about.
That I must have to hear this!
It was my misfortunate to
give birth to you two.
You won't even let me work,
because of your 'prestige'.
If I could work as a maid,
I could feed my son.
Sister-in-law,
where are my poems?
Address me, not the women.
I sold it for
Waste papers?
You sold my poems for 10 annas?
Uncouth fools no better.
You call me uncouth?
Did you hear that, brother?
I got rid of them this morning,
Now I'll get rid of you! Out!
Son.
Where will you go on an empty
stomach? Who will tend to you?
You take me along with you.
I don't want to stay
here for another minute.
Don't worry mother
I'll do my best.
I'll take you away
from here as soon as I can.
Let me get on with my work
instead of searching waste papers.
But there was an important file.
A file containing
hand written papers?
Where are they?
- A woman brought them.
They caught her eye, she
read some then she took them away.
Which women?
Where does she live?
I don't know
she wasn't a local I person.
If she comes again, I'll ask.
Come, come!
Have you fallen out
with your brother again?
Are you hungry?
You'll starve to death.
Well, today I got
His car ran over a women's leg.
I gave false witness for him.
Shyam, remember how you
found a lame sparrow as a kid.
You cared for it
until it was better.
It was only a kid.
But you are still a kid.
Lament not..
..if I turn my face away.
Your gaze is filled.
With such longing.
Listen.
I was saying..
Who know what you said?
Who knows what I heard?
Some thing stirred in my heart.
Who knows what you said..?
Who knows what I heard?
Something stirred in my heart.
I felt my heart awaken.
I felt such elation.
Slumbering dreams reawakened,
something stirred in my heart.
Who knows what you said?
Who knows what I heard?
Something stirred in my heart.
I stumble no more,
my feet no longer falter.
There is new life in my step,
something stirred in my heart.
Who knows what you said?
Who knows what I heard?
But something sure
stirred in my heart.
The cascade of my hair
is filled with sweet fragrance.
Doors open to
reveal secret longings.
Something stirred in my heart.
Who knows what you said.
Who knows what I heard.
Something stirred in my heart.
Excuse me.. - Yes.
That song you were singing..
- You like it?
Where did you get it?
It's mine.
It isn't yours.
- Then why ask if you know.
Because l.. - What do you want?
The file with that song in it.
Is that all?
I don't like prattle.
Do you like me?
No.
Then why follow me?
I want to know only that
the file is with you or not?
It's valuable to me.
Whenever I have money.
So you followed me
empty handed? Get out!
Please understand.
I want only that file.
For me it is important.
You go, or should
I remove my sandal?
Stop shouting, silly.
Your customer will run away.
I papered I lured him here,
but he hasn't penny.
Juhi, it was him.
Gulabo, where are you running?
I must apologize to him,
I treated him very badly.
Stop talking in riddles
and tell me in plain words.
What's all this about?
The man who
followed me is a poet.
The poet whose poems
I have bought as waste paper.
Look: the same paper,
the same writing.
And I threw him out as a pauper.
He is the pauper.
You did the quite right thing.
Foolish girl.  Come on!
Have you written
any poems in the holidays?
A few.
Anyone can write poems. If you're..
..a true poet, create something.
Extempore?
But on what subject.
Who is she?
There's your subject:
a poem about her.
When I walk even my
shadows lag behind.
When you walk,
the universe keeps pace.
When I stop
clouds of misery gather.
When you stop..
spring radiance is outshone.
Miss Pushlata.
Our love will
survive every trial.
We shall never
forget our oath of love.
We leave the
world far behind.
How long will
be the journey together?
Coolie!
A coolie at your service.
Put these in the car.
What has the world come to?
The educated work as coolies.
Have you got money?
No credit.
It's counterfeit.
Say you've got nothing else.
Say that's your game!
Now who'll pay for the
food you have touched?
Keep the food.
Go to a barber and get
yourself made to look more human.
I'm not hungry - Yes, you are.
You have no right to
take pity on me.
I'm sorry..
.. take no notice of me.
You have every
right to be angry.
I treated you very
badly the other day.
I've nothing against you.
Then please eat..
.. for my sake.
What did you say? For your sake?
You don't even know me.
I know you very well - How?
Through your poems.
I know your
thoughts and feelings.
What else is there?
I don't understand.
But, miss.
Why address me so politely?
I am not used to.
Until today,
people have spoken rudely to me.
I have suffered
their vulgar remarks..
..their abuse,
their crude jokes.
But you behave so respectfully.
Massage, oil massage
make things gleam!
If your head reels with pain
or your heart sinks in gloom.
..don't fret leave it to me.
I'll set things right soon.
Massage, oil massage!
The lotion I use has the magic.
Curing baldness and dandruff.
Once my hands begin to whirl
your hair your fate will change.
Mark my words, my friends,
this lotion brings joy.
It cures thousands of ailments,
so why you not give a try?
Suffering a lovers tiff?
Is your business in throes?
A touch of this supple
hand will dissipate all woes.

Be you a leader or the public.
Come to me, and every one does.
Come to me and bow his head.
Mark my words, my friends,
this lotion brings joy.
It cures thousands of ailments,
so why not give a try?
Don't fret, leave it to me..
If your head reels with pain
or your heart sinks in gloom.
Mr. Vijay, come here.
A great poet:
I was singing one of his poems.
Since I'm singing your song,
business has doubled.
Don't go.
I'll just finish him - What?
Stay put.
Mr. Vijay I'll give you a
special massage completely free.
No, thank you. The present
times have battered me enough.
It's amazing how you
still manage to smile.
Only a donkey in the noon sun..
..and a poet lost in
the poetry are so stunned.
True, only the glitter
of gold is like a sun.
So donkeys will.
What are you talking about?
- We're discussing donkeys.
Here I am.
Juhi, weren't you
waiting for me.
I'm waiting for a man in a car.
- In a car? Not a masseur.
May his tyres get punctured!
May your head get punctured!
Juhi, what happened?
Are you cross with me?
Have you no consideration
for the heart you have punctured.
Get it patched up.
- I have no wife to patch up.
What can I do about it?
- Marry me.
Stop it idiot!
Did you hear?
I have the gift of massaging.
If I had the gift if
cheating we could afford a car.
I'm done for!
A coconut? I get it.
I won't say another word.
Stop him I'll have
to chase him for a mile!
Stop! Naughty fellow.
Hello, Puspha
Vijay, I didn't recognize you.
You were so handsome.
Whose love brought you this?
Someone who won't
let me go. Unemployment.
Your children?
- And their father's.
They're Gullu and Fullu,
bright sparks like him.
What do you mean?
There's gathering at our old
college tonight, you must come.
Now I'll have to
him for a mile. I'll leave.
You must come tonight.
Where is Bhatacharya?
He was going to sing next.
Vijay, why hide out here?
Come inside.
No Puspha, my clothes..
You're decently covered
from head to foot.  Come along.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Bhatacharya isn't here.
We are delighted..
..we're delighted
that vijay is here.
..and I request him
to recite a poem.
Don't be formal.
Come along.
Let's hear you, Vijay.
I am weary of
this troubled life.
Weary of this
troubled existence.
I am grief, may I not
reject the entire world.
Why such a sad song on this
occasion? Recite a happy verse.
How can I sing of joy..
..if I live in pain.
I can only.
..return to life what
life itself offers to me
Once again..
.. the memories of love
stir in my heart.
I confess..
.. that I have been overcome
by my life's blows.
Today I break all belief.
..in the illusion of hope.
Today I vow..
..to voice no
complaint against anyone.
Are you an ex-student.
Have you a job?
No, I need one.
You recite very well.
Here's my card.
Come to my office tomorrow.
Yourself?
Here are my poems.
When did you study at college?
- From 48 to 52.
Shall I read the poems aloud?
I married in 1952.
Did you study science or arts?
Arts. May I recite the poems?
You're sure you left college
in 52, or was it before?
In 52. Mr. Ghosh, my poems?
- Will you work?
Service? I thought you
called me for publishing poems.
There's still plenty of
time to publish your poems.
I must get to know you better first.
About me? - Yes.
Mr.  Chatterjee,
he is your new assistant.
You can join from tomorrow.
If I were to give my
heart to you? To your eyes?
If I were to lock your heart
away by closing my eyes?
If I were to adorn you
hair with flowers of love.
If I were to shake the
flowers to the ground.
If I were to remember
you in my dreams.
If I were to give
you sleepless nights.
If I were to lay my
heart at your feet.
If I were to deny your
love and walk away.
How have you been?
- l' m alive.
I want to see you happy.
Don't worry.
I have learnt to be happy.
Has some girl taught you?
One girl was enough for me.
I don't want to suffer again.
You mean you have erased
your first love.
I should have.
I forgot: I was
really going up.
Closing times.
Does Mr. Vijay
come here often?
Yes, but not lately.
Any message for him.
So you find something to
say to the waiter. What about me?
Have you had time
to look at them?
Which papers?
- Vijay calls them his poetry.
I've read them,
they are fine.
Why not publish some?
Are you mad? You must know..
..we publish famous poets,
not thrash of novices.
Put in advertisement instead.
What do you want?
Sir, this thrash of novice..
..may I take it away?
Yes.
Are you free tomorrow evening?
Come and lend a hand at
a party in my house.
I'll be there.
It's no good
getting upset, Juhi.
Who will care
for you in your old age?
God willing.
Be careful, or a
nut will fall on you.
If you want security,
listen to me.
If I'll listen
to you, I'll starve.
You can hardly keep yourself,
how can you feed me, too?
My hunger will be satisfied
by seeing you in my house.
Really?
Abdul sattar,
do you love me so much?
Let's marry
- Stop it, idiot.
Do you hear? No, nothing.
No nut.
Your husband? - He's ill.
He wanted me to take him
to hospital, but I put it off.
How could I miss such a party?
You're very kind.
And the children.
How did you get my address?
Your address?
Do you live here?
Let's go outside.
Mr. Ghosh told me to come.
Told you? Do you know him?
I work for him.
And you? - I am his..
Who is the most
talented poet here?
They are all good.
But the one in
black jacket is..
Don't tell him
about us. Understand?
Poems that serve
the nation are better than..
.. Iove poems.
Gentlemen, drop this argument.
The drinks are here.
Leave it to the servant, dear.
Come along, serve the drinks.
How could l..
.apprise her of my love.
The words froze on my lips.
Tears welled in my love.
In the gallantry
of frigid hearts.
Where pleasure is sought.
Clammy fingers cling
to the cup of whine.
I quaffed the wine,
a drop was spilled.
An extreme despair
came to my rescue.
Receiving my poet, out of pity,
she deigned to love me.
Who are the fortunate ones..
..who gain the love they seek.
Great Mr. Ghosh! Even your
servants recite poems.
I'll arrange for the dinner.
-  Can only rich be the poets?
Go ahead, young man.
When I ask for flowers,
I was given thorns.
Who are the fortunate ones..
..who gain the love they seek?
When I searched
for the happiness..
..I was lost in the
streets of sadness.
When I sought songs of joy,
I heard songs of sorrow.
Every friend doubled
the pain of my heart.
When I ask for flowers,
I was given thorns.
Who are the fortunate ones..
..who got the love they sought.
Companions came..
Companions came, stayed a
while then left me all alone.
Who had the time to spare to
clasp the hand of falling man?
Even my shadows elude me
as its fades away.
When I ask for flowers,
I was given thorns.
Who are the fortunate ones
who gain the love they seek?
If this is called living then
I'll live my life somehow.
I shall not sigh, I shall seal
my lips, I shall dry my tears.
Why should I fear grief, when
I have encountered it so often?
