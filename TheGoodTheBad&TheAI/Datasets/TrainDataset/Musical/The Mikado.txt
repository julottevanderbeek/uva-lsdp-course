If you want to know who we are
We are gentlemen of Japan
On many a vase and jar
On many a screen and fan
We figure in lively paint
Our attitude's queer and quaint
You're wrong if you think it ain't
Oh
If you think we are
worked by strings
Like a Japanese marionette
You don't understand these things
It is simply court etiquette
Perhaps you suppose this throng
can't keep it up all day long
If that's your idea, you're wrong
Oh
Oh
If that's your idea, you're wrong
If you want to know who we are
We are gentlemen of Japan
On vase and jar
On screens and fans
On many, many, many, many
many, many, many, many a jar
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
On vase and jar
On screen and fan
My son, you've had the misfortune
to captivate Katisha.
She's misconstrued my customary affability
into expressions of affection.
She claims you in marriage.
And I order you to marry her
within a week, or - or -
I forget the punishment.
Oh.
Perish ignominiously
on the scaffold.
But -
The sun, whose rays are all ablaze
With ever-living glory
Does not deny his majesty
He scorns to tell a story
He don't exclaim
I blush for shame
So kindly be indulgent
But fierce and bold, in fiery gold
He glories all effulgent
I mean to rule the earth
As he the sky
We really know our worth
The sun and I
I mean to rule the earth
as he the sky
We really know our worth
The sun and I
A wand'ring minstrel I
A thing of shreds and patches
Of ballads, songs and snatches
And dreamy lullaby
My catalog is long
Through every passion ranging
And to your humors changing
I tune my supple song
I tune my supple
Song
Are you in sentimental mood
I'll sigh with you
Oh
Sorrow
On maiden's coldness
do you brood
I'll do so too
Oh
Sorrow
Sorrow
I'll charm your willing ears
With songs of lovers' fears
While sympathetic tears
My cheeks bedew
Oh
Sorrow
Sorrow
But if patriotic sentiment is wanted
I've patriotic ballads cut and dried
For where'er our country's banner
may be planted
All other local banners are defied
Our warriors
in serried ranks assembled
Never quail or they conceal it
if they do
And I shouldn't be surprised
if nations trembled
Before the mighty troops
the troops of Titipu
We shouldn't be surprised if nations
trembled trembled with alarm
Before the mighty troops
the troops of Titipu
And if you call for
a song of the sea
We'll heave the capstan round
With a yeo heave ho
for the wind is free
Her anchor's atrip
and her helm's alee
Hurrah for the homeward bound
Yeo ho, heave ho
Hurrah for the homeward bound
To lay aloft in a howling breeze
May tickle a landsman's taste
But the happiest hour a sailor sees
Is when he's down
at an inland town
With his Nancy on his knees
Yeo ho
And his arm around her waist
Then man the capstan, off we go
As the fiddler swings us round
With a yeo heave ho
and a rum below
Hurrah for the homeward bound
With a yeo heave ho
and a rum below
-  Yeo ho, heave ho
-  Yeo ho, heave ho
Yeo ho, heave ho,
heave ho, heave ho
Yeo ho
A wand'ring minstrel I
A thing of shreds and patches
Of ballads, songs and snatches
And dreamy lullaby
And dreamy lullaby
Lullaby
Gentlemen.
I pray you tell me where a gentle maiden
dwelleth named Yum-Yum - the ward of Ko-Ko.
And what may be your business
with Yum-Yum?
A year ago, I saw Yum-Yum.
We loved each other at once...
but she was betrothed to her
guardian Ko-Ko, a cheap tailor...
and I saw that my suit was hopeless.
Judge of my delight when I heard
a month ago...
that Ko-Ko had been condemned
to death for flirting.
I hurried back at once, hoping
I should find Yum-Yum at liberty.
It is true that Ko-Ko was
condemned to death for flirting.
But he was reprieved
at the last moment...
and raised to the exalted rank
of Lord High Executioner...
under the following remarkable
circumstances:
Our great Mikado, virtuous man
when he to rule our land began
Resolved to try
a plan whereby
Young men might best be steadied
So he decreed in words succinct
That all who flirted,
leered or winked
Unless connubially linked
Should forthwith be beheaded
Beheaded
Beheaded
Should forthwith be beheaded
And I expect you'll all agree
that he was right to so decree
And I am right
And you are right
And all is right as right can be
And you are right
And we are right
And all is right, is
right as right can be
And all is right as right can be
Right as right can be
And so we straight let out on bail
a convict from the county jail
Whose head was next
on some pretext
Condemned to be mown off
And made him headsman,
for we said
Who's next to be decapited
Cannot cut off another's head
until he's cut his own off
His own off
His own off
Until he's cut his own off
And we are right, I think you'll
say to argue in this kind of way
And I am right
And you are right
And all is right, too-loorallay
And you are right
And we are right
And all is right,
too-loora-loorallay
And I am right
And you are right
And all
Is right
Ko-Ko, the cheap tailor,
Lord High Executioner of Titipu.
Why, that's the highest rank
a citizen can attain.
It is.
That is Pooh-Bah.
Our logical Mikado, seeing no moral
difference between the dignified judge...
who condemns a criminal to die...
and the industrious mechanic
who carries out the sentence...
has rolled the two
offices into one...
and every judge is now
his own executioner.
But how good of you,
a nobleman of the highest rank...
to condescend to tell all this
to me, a mere strolling minstrel.
Don't mention it.
I am, in point of fact...
a particularly haughty
and exclusive person...
of preadamite ancestral descent.
You will understand this when I tell
you that I can trace my ancestry back...
to a protoplasmal primordial
atomic globule.
Consequently, my family pride
is something inconceivable.
I can't help it.
I was born sneering.
But I struggle hard
to overcome this defect.
I mortify my pride continually.
When all the great officers
of state resigned in a body...
because they were too proud
to serve under an ex-tailor...
did I not unhesitatingly accept
all their posts at once?
And the salaries attached to them?
- Oh.
- You did.
A Pooh-Bah paid for his services!
I a salaried minion!
But I do it.
It revolts me, but I do it.
And it does you credit.
But I don't stop at that.
I also retail state secrets
at a very low figure.
- For instance -
- Any information about Yum-Yum -
Would come under the head
of a state secret.
Another insult,
and, I think, a light one.
-
-
Behold the Lord High Executioner
A personage of noble rank and title
A dignified and potent officer
Whose functions are
particularly vital
Defer, defer
To the Lord High Executioner
Defer, defer
To the noble lord
To the noble lord
To the Lord High Executioner
Taken from a county jail
By a set of curious chances
Liberated then on bail
On my own recognizances
Wafted by a favoring gale
As one sometimes is in trances
To a height that few can scale
Save by long and weary dances
Surely never had a male
Under suchlike circumstances
So adventurous a tale
Which may rank with most romances
-  Taken from a county jail
-  Taken from a county jail
-  By a set of curious chances
-  Liberated then on bail
Surely never had a male
So adventurous a tale
Defer, defer
To the Lord High Executioner
Defer, defer
To the noble lord
To the noble Lord High Executioner
Bow down, bow down
to the Lord High Executioner
Defer, defer
To the noble Lord
High Executioner
Oh, Pooh-Bah, Pooh-Bah.
It seems that the
festivities in connection...
...with my approaching
marriage must last a week.
Now I should like to do the thing
handsomely, and I want to consult you...
as to the amount I ought to spend
upon them.
Certainly. In which
of my capacities?
As first lord of the treasury,
lord chamberlain...
attorney general,
chancellor of the exchequer...
privy purse or private secretary?
Suppose we say as private secretary.
Speaking as your private secretary...
I should say that, as the city will have
to pay for it, don't stint yourself.
- Do it well.
- Exactly.
As the city will have to pay for it -
that is your advice.
Of course,
as chancellor of the exchequer...
I am bound to see that
due economy is observed.
Oh, but you said just now,
"Don't stint yourself. Do it well."
As private secretary.
And now you say
that due economy must be observed.
As chancellor of the exchequer.
I see.
Come over here where the
chancellor can't hear us.
Now then, as my solicitor...
how would you advise me to
deal with this difficulty?
Oh, as your solicitor, I should have
no hesitation in saying "Chance it."
- Thanks. I will. - If it were not
that, as lord chief justice...
I am bound to see
that the law isn't violated.
Now then,
as first lord of the treasury?
Of course,
as first lord of the treasury...
I could propose a special vote
that would cover all expenses -
if it were not that,
as leader of the opposition...
it would be my duty
to resist it tooth and nail.
Or, as paymaster general,
I could so cook the accounts...
that, as lord high auditor,
I should never discover the fraud.
But... as archbishop of Titipu...
it would be my duty
to denounce my dishonesty...
and give myself into my own custody
as first commissioner of police.
That's extremely awkward.
I don't say that all these distinguished
people couldn't be squared.
The matter shall have
my careful consideration.
Comes a train of little ladies
From scholastic trammels free
And we wonder
How we wonder
We wonder
How we wonder
What on earth the world can be
What on earth
The world can be
Three little maids
from school are we
Pert as a schoolgirl well can be
Filled to the brim
with girlish glee
Three little maids from school
Everything is a source of fun
Nobody's safe,
for we care for none
Life is a joke that's just begun
Three little maids from school
Three little maids who all unwary
come from a ladies' seminary
Freed from its genius tutelary
Three little maids from school
Three little maids from school
One little maid is a bride, Yum-Yum
Two little maids in attendance come
Three little maids is the total sum
Three little maids from school
From three little maids
take one away
Two little maids remain, and they
Won't have to wait very long
they say
-  Three little maids from school
-  Three little maids from school
Three little maids who all unwary
come from a ladies' seminary
Freed from its genius tutelary
Three little maids from school
Three little maids from school
At last, me bride that is to be.
Oh, but you're not going to kiss
me before all these people?
Well, that was the idea.
- It seems odd, doesn't it?
- It's rather peculiar.
Oh, I expect it's all right.
Must have a beginning, you know.
Well, of course.
I know nothing about these things.
But I've no objection...
if it's usual.
Oh, it's quite usual...
I think.
Eh, Lord Chamberlain?
I have known it done.
Thank goodness that's over.
- Nanki-Poo!
- Oh, Nanki-Poo!
- I'm so glad! - I haven't
seen you for ever so long!
I've come home for good.
And I'm not going back anymore!
I beg your pardon,
but will you present me?
Oh, this is the gentleman -
One at a time, please.
If you please. He is the gentleman
who used to play so beautifully on the -
Oh, on the, uh - on the -
On the Marine Parade.
Oh, sir, I have the misfortune
to love your ward Yum-Yum.
Oh, I know I deserve your anger.
You -
Anger? Not a bit, my boy.
Why, I love her myself.
Charming little girl, isn't she?
Pretty eyes, nice hair.
Taking little thing altogether.
Very glad to hear my opinion
backed by a competent authority.
Thank you very much. Good-bye.
Take him away.
Oh!
Yum-Yum!
Oh, at last we're alone.
I've sought you night and day
for three weeks...
with the belief that your guardian
was beheaded.
But now I find that you're about
to be married to him this afternoon.
Yes.
But you do not love him?
No.
Oh, why don't you refuse him?
What good would that do?
He is my guardian,
and he wouldn't let me marry you.
Besides, a wand'ring minstrel who plays
a wind instrument outside teahouses...
is hardly a fitting husband for
the ward of the Lord High Executioner.
Oh, but...
what if it should prove
that after all I am no musician?
There! I was certain of it,
directly I heard you play.
Oh, it -
But what if it should
prove that I am...
...the son of His
Majesty the Mikado?
- The son of the Mikado?
- Oh! Shh, shh, shh!
But why is Your Highness disguised?
And what has Your Highness done? And will
Your Highness promise never to do it again?
Some years ago I had the misfortune
to captivate Katisha...
an elderly lady of my father's court.
My father ordered me to marry her
within a week or perish on a scaffold.
That night I fled his court and, assuming
the disguise of a second trombone...
I joined the band in
which you found me.
Were you not to Ko-Ko plighted
I would say in tender tone
Loved one, let us be united
Let us be each other's own
I would merge all rank and station
Worldly sneers are naught to us
And to mark my admiration
I would kiss you fondly thus
-  I would kiss you fondly thus
-  He would kiss me fondly thus
But as I'm engaged to Ko-Ko
To embrace you thus, con fuoco
Would distinctly be no gioco
And for yam I should get toco
So, in spite of all temptation
Such a theme I'll not discuss
And on no consideration
Will I kiss you
Fondly thus
Will I kiss you
Fondly thus
Let me make it clear to you
This is what I'll never do
This, oh, this
Oh, this
Oh, this
This is what I'll never, never do
This, oh, this
Oh, this, oh, this
This
-  Is what I'll never do
-  You'll never do
-  I'll never do
-  You'll never do
Oh, this
This
Is what I'll never
Never do
I am the bearer of a letter
from His Majesty, the Mikado.
A letter from the Mikado?
What in the world
can he have to say to me?
Ah, here it is at last.
I thought it would come
sooner or late - later.
The Mikado is struck by the fact...
that no executions have taken
place in Titipu for a year.
And he decrees that unless someone
is beheaded within one month...
the post of Lord High Executioner
shall be abolished!
And the city reduced
to the rank of a village!
There's no help for it.
I shall have to execute
somebody at once.
The only question is,
who shall it be?
Well, it seems unkind to say so...
but as you're already under
sentence of death for flirting...
everything seems to point to you.
To - To me? Wh-What are you talking
about? I can't execute myself.
Why not?
I don't see how a man can
cut off his own head.
A man might try.
If he only succeeded
in cutting it half off -
that would be something.
No. Pardon me, but
there I am adamant.
I am afraid that unless
you can obtain a substitute -
A substitute?
Nothing easier.
Pooh-Bah, I appoint you
lord high substitute.
I should be delighted.
Such an appointment would
realize my fondest dreams!
But, no, at any sacrifice...
I must set bounds
to my insatiable ambition.
I am so proud
if I allowed
My family pride
to be my guide
I'd volunteer
to quit this sphere
Instead of you
in a minute or two
But family pride
must be denied
And set aside
and mortified
And mortified
My brain, it teems
with endless schemes
Both good and new
for Titipu, for Titipu
But if I flit the benefit that
I'd diffuse the town would lose
Now every man to aid his clan
should plot and plan as best he can
I heard one day
a gentleman say
That criminals who
are cut in two
Can hardly feel
the fatal steel
And so are slain
are slain without much pain
If this is true
it's jolly for you
Your courage screw
to bid us adieu
-  I am so proud
-  My brain, it teems
-  If I allowed my family pride
-  I heard one day a gentleman say
-  To be my guide
-  For Titipu, for Titipu
-  If I flit the benefit that I'd
diffuse the town would lose
Now every man to aid his clan
should plot and plan as best he can
And so although
I'm ready to go
Yet recollect 'twere disrespect
did I neglect to thus effect
This aim direct
so I object
And so although
I wish to go
And greatly pine to brightly shine
and take the line of a hero fine
With grief condign
I must decline
And go and show
both friend and foe
How much you dare
I'm quite aware
It's your affair
yet I declare
I'd take your share
but I don't much care
-  I must
-  So I object
-  I'd take your share but I don't
much care  -  So I object
-  I must
-  So I object
-  I must decline -  So I
object, so I object, so I object
To sit in solemn silence
in a dull, dark dock
In a pestilential prison
with a lifelong lock
Awaiting the sensation
of a short, sharp shock
From a cheap and chippy chopper
on a big black block
To sit in solemn silence
in a dull, dark dock
In a pestilential prison
with a lifelong lock
Awaiting the sensation
of a short, sharp shock
From a cheap and chippy chopper
on a big black block
A dull, dark dock
A lifelong lock
A short, sharp shock
A big black block
To sit in solemn silence
in a pestilential prison
And awaiting the sensation
from a cheap and chippy chopper
On a big
Black
Block
This is simply appalling!
Is this public gratitude?
What are you going to do
with that rope?
I'm about to terminate
an unendurable existence.
Terminate your existence?
Nonsense!
What for?
Because you're going to marry
the girl I adore.
Nonsense, sir.
I won't permit it.
I am a humane man, and if you
attempt anything of the kind...
I shall order your instant arrest.
Come, sir. Desist at once,
or I summon my guard.
That's absurd. If you attempt
to raise an alarm...
I instantly perform the happy
dispatch with this dagger.
No, no! Don't do that!
Why, this is horrible.
You cold-blooded scoundrel.
Are you aware that in taking your
life you're committing a crime?
Committing a crime which -
which -
The substitute!
What's the matter?
Is it absolutely certain
that you're resolved to die?
Absolutely.
- Will nothing shake your
resolution? - Nothing.
Then, if you really
mean what you say,
...don't spoil yourself
by committing suicide...
but be beheaded handsomely at
the hands of the public executioner.
- I don't see how that would
benefit me. - You don't?
Observe.
You'll have a month to live, and you'll
live like a fighting cock at my expense.
When the day comes, there'll
be a grand public ceremonial.
You will be the central figure.
No one will attempt to deprive you
of that distinction.
There'll be a procession,
bands, dead march, bells tolling...
all the girls in tears -
Yum-Yum distracted.
Then, when it's all over,
general rejoicings...
and a display of fireworks
in the evening!
You won't see them, but
they'll be there all the same.
Do you think Yum-Yum will
really be distracted at my death?
I'm convinced of it. Bless you, she's the
most tenderhearted little creature alive.
I should be sorry to cause her pain.
Perhaps, after all,
if I were to withdraw from Japan...
and travel in Europe for a couple of
years, I might contrive to forget her.
Oh, I don't think you could
forget Yum-Yum so easily.
And, after all, what is more
miserable than a love-blighted life?
True.
Life without Yum-Yum.
Why, it seems absurd.
And yet there are a great many people
in the world who have to endure it.
Poor devils, yes! You're quite
right not to be of their number.
I won't be of their number!
Noble fellow!
I'll tell you how we'll manage it.
Let me marry Yum-Yum tomorrow...
and in a month you may behead me.
No. No. I draw the line at Yum-Yum.
Very good. If you can draw
the line, so can I.
No! Stop! Listen one moment!
Be reasonable.
She'll be a widow in a month,
and you can marry her then.
Yes, that's true, of course.
I quite see that.
But dear me. My position during
the next month will be most unpleasant.
Most unpleasant.
Not half so unpleasant
as my position at the end of it.
Yes, but dear me -
Oh, very well. I agree.
After all, it's only putting off
one's wedding for a month.
But you won't prejudice her
against me, will you?
You see, I've educated
her to be my wife.
She's been taught to regard me
as a wise and good man.
Now, I shouldn't like her views
on that point disturbed.
Trust me, she shall never learn
the truth from me.
To ask you what you mean to do
we punctually appear
Congratulate me, gentlemen
I've found a volunteer
The Japanese equivalent
for hear, hear, hear
'Tis Nanki-Poo
Hail, Nanki-Poo
I think he'll do
Yes, yes, he'll do
He yields his life
if I'll Yum-Yum surrender
Now, I adore that girl
with passion tender
And could not yield her
with a ready will
Or her allot
if I did not
Adore myself with passion
Tenderer still
With passion tenderer still
Ah, yes, he loves himself
With passion tenderer still
Take her
She's yours
The threatened cloud has passed away
And brightly shines the dawning day
What though the night
may come too soon
There's yet a month of afternoon
Then let the throng
of joy advance
With laughing song
and merry dance
Then let the throng
of joy advance
With laughing song
and merry dance
With laughing song
and merry dance
With laughing song
With joyous shout
With joyous shout and ringing cheer
Inaugurate
Inaugurate their brief career
With joyous shout and ringing cheer
Inaugurate their brief career
With joyous shout and ringing cheer
Inaugurate their brief career
Laughing song, merry dance
With laughing song and merry dance
As in a month you've got to die
If Ko-Ko tells us true
'Twere empty compliment to cry
Long life to Nanki-Poo
But as one month you have to live
As fellow citizen
This toast with three times three
we'll give
Long life
Long life to you
Long life to you
Long life
To you
Till then
May all good fortune
all good fortune prosper you
May you have health
May you have health and riches too
May all good fortune prosper you
May you have health and riches too
-  May you succeed in all you do
-  Long life to you till then
Your revels cease
Assist me, all of you
Why, who is this whose evil eyes
rain blight on our festivities
I claim my perjured lover
Nanki-Poo
Oh, fool
to shun delights that never cloy
Go, leave thy deadly work undone
Come back, oh, shallow fool
Come back to joy
Away, away, ill-favored one
Ah! 'Tis Katisha,
the maid of whom I told you.
No, you shall not go
These arms shall thus enfold you
Away, nor prosecute your quest
From our intention well expressed
You cannot turn us
The state of your connubial views
Towards the person you accuse
Does not concern us
For
-  He's going to marry Yum-Yum
-  Yum-Yum
Your anger pray bury
for all will be merry
-  I think you had better succumb
-  Cumb, cumb
And join our expressions of glee
-  On this subject I pray you be dumb
-  Dumb, dumb
You'll find there are many
who'll wed for a penny
-  The word for your guidance is
"mum"  -  Mum, mum
There's lots of good fish in the sea
On this subject we pray
you be dumb Dumb, dumb
We think you had better succumb
Cumb, cumb
You'll find there are many who'll
wed for a penny, who'll wed for a penny
There's lots of good fish in the sea
There are lots of good fish in the sea
There's lots of good fish
good fish in the sea
There's lots of good fish good fish
in the sea, in the sea, in the sea
In the sea, in the sea
Oh, faithless one
This insult you shall rue
In vain for mercy
On your knees you'll sue
I'll tear the mask
from your disguising
Now comes the blow.
Prepare yourselves
for news surprising
How foil my foe?
No minstrel he, despite bravado
Ha, ha. I know.
He is the son of your
O ni, bikkuri shakkuri to
In vain you interrupt
with this tornado
He is the only son of your
O ni, bikkuri shakkuri to
I'll spoil
O ni, bikkuri shakkuri to
Your gay gambado
He is the son
O ni, bikkuri shakkuri to
-  Of your
-  O ni, bikkuri shakkuri to
-  The son of your
-  O ni, bikkuri shakkuri to
Oh, yar
Oh, yar
We'll hear no more, ill-omened owl
To joy we soar, despite your scowl
The echoes of our festival
shall rise triumphant over all
Prepare for woe, ye haughty lords
At once I'll go Mikadowards
We do not heed their dismal sound
For joy reigns everywhere around
We do not heed their dismal sound
For joy reigns everywhere around
The echoes of our festival
Shall rise triumphant over all
-  Shall rise triumphant
-  Shall rise triumphant
Triumphant over all
Shall rise triumphant over all
My wrongs with vengeance
shall be crowned
We do not heed their dismal sound
For joy reigns everywhere around
We do not heed their dismal sound
For joy reigns everywhere around
-  My wrongs with vengeance shall be crowned
-  We do not heed their dismal sound
-  My wrongs with vengeance
-  For joy reigns every...
-  Shall
- ...where
-  Be
-  A...
-  Crowned
- ...round
Braid the raven hair
Weave the supple tress
Deck the maiden fair
in her loveliness
Paint the pretty face
Dye the coral lip
Emphasize the grace
of her ladyship
Art and nature thus allied
Go to make a pretty bride
Art and nature thus allied
Go to make a pretty bride
The sun, whose rays are all ablaze
With ever-living glory
Does not deny his majesty
He scorns to tell a story
He don't exclaim
I blush for shame
So kindly be indulgent
But fierce and bold, in fiery gold
He glories all effulgent
I mean to rule the earth
As he the sky
We really know our worth
The sun and I
I mean to rule the earth
as he the sky
We really know our worth
The sun and I
Yes!
Everything seems to smile upon me.
I'm to be married today
to the man I love best...
and I believe
I'm the very happiest girl in Japan.
Well, dear, it can't be denied...
that the fact that your husband
is to be beheaded in a month...
is, in its way, a drawback.
It does seem to
take the top off it, you know.
I don't know about that.
It all depends.
At all events, he will
find it a drawback.
Not necessarily, bless you.
It all depends.
Oh! I think it very
indelicate of you...
to refer to such a subject
on such a day.
If my married happiness
is to be - to be -
Cut short?
Well, cut short in a month...
can't you let me forget it?
Yum-Yum! Yum-Yum in tears -
and on her wedding morn?
They've been reminding me that
in a month you're to be beheaded.
A month? Why, what's a month?
These divisions of time
are purely arbitrary.
Who says 24 hours make a day?
There's a popular impression
to that effect.
Then we'll efface it.
We'll call each second a minute -
each minute an hour...
each hour a day
and each day a year.
Oh, at that rate, we've about 30 years
of married happiness before us.
Yes. How time flies when one
is thoroughly enjoying oneself.
That's the way to look at it.
Don't let's be downhearted.
There's a silver lining
to every cloud.
Brightly dawns our wedding day
Joyous hour, we give thee greeting
Whither, whither art thou fleeting
Fickle moment, prithee stay
Fickle moment, prithee stay
What though mortal joys be hollow
Pleasures come, if sorrows follow
-  Though the tocsin sound ere long
-  Ere long
-  Though the tocsin sound ere long
-  Ding-dong, ding-dong
-  Though the tocsin sound ere long
-  Ding-dong, ding-dong
Ding-dong
-  Ding
-  Ding
Dong
Yet until the shadows fall
Over one and over all
Sing a merry madrigal
Sing a merry madrigal
Sing a merry madrigal
-  Fa, la, fa, la  -  Fa, la,

- Oh, go on. Don't mind me. - Oh,
I'm afraid we're distressing you.
Never mind.
I must get used to it.
Only please do it by degrees.
Begin by placing your
arm around her waist.
No, no.
Not yet. Let me get used
to that first.
Oh, wouldn't you like to retire?
It must pain you to see us
so affectionate together.
No. I must learn to bear it.
Now oblige me by allowing her
head to rest on your shoulder.
Like that?
I'm much obliged to you.
Now, k -
k- k-k -
kiss her.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's simple torture!
Oh. Oh, come, come. Bear up.
After all, it's only for a month.
No. It's no use deluding oneself
with false hopes.
- What do you mean?
- My child. My poor child.
My little bride that
was to have been.
"Was to have been"?
You never can be mine.
- Oh!
- What?
Oh, I'm so glad!
I've just ascertained
that, by the Mikado's law...
when a married man is beheaded,
his wife is buried alive.
- Buried alive?
- Buried alive!
Buried alive.
It's a most unpleasant death.
- But whom did you get that from?
- Oh, from Pooh-Bah.
- He's my solicitor.
- But he may be mistaken.
So I thought. So I consulted the
attorney general, the lord chief justice...
the master of the rolls, the judge
ordinary and the lord chancellor.
They're all of the same opinion.
Never knew such unanimity
on a point of law in my life.
But stop a bit. This law
has never been put in force.
Not yet. You see, flirting is the only
crime punishable with decapitation...
and married men never flirt.
Oh, I quite forgot that.
Well, I - I suppose I may take it that
my dream of happiness is at an end.
- Darling -
- Yes?
Oh.
I don't want to appear selfish...
and I love you with all my heart.
It makes a difference, doesn't it?
You see, burial alive - It's -
It's such a stuffy death.
I call it a beast of a death.
You see my difficulty, don't you?
Yes.
And I see my own. If I insist
on you carrying out your promise...
I doom you to a hideous death.
If I release you,
you marry Ko-Ko at once.
Oh!
Here's a how-de-do
If I marry you
when your time has come to perish
Then the maiden whom you cherish
must be slaughtered too
Here's a how-de-do
Here's a how-de-do
Here's a pretty mess
In a month or less
I must die without a wedding
Let the bitter tears I'm shedding
witness my distress
Here's a pretty mess
Here's a pretty mess
Here's a state of things
To her life she clings
Matrimonial devotion
doesn't seem to suit her notion
Burial it brings
Here's a state of things
Here's a state of things
With a passion that's intense
I worship and adore
But the laws of common sense
we oughtn't to ignore
If what he says is true
'tis death to marry you
Here's a pretty state of things
Here's a pretty how-de-do
Here's a pretty state of things
A pretty state of things
-  Here's a how-de-do  -  Here's
a how-de-do  -  Here's a how-de-do
For if what he says is true
I cannot, cannot marry you
Here's a pretty,
pretty state of things
Here's a pretty how-de-do
Here's a how-de-do
If I marry you
when your time has come to perish
Then the maiden whom you cherish
must be slaughtered too
Here's a how-de-do
Here's a how-de-do
Here's a pretty mess

-  Here's a how-de-do  -  Here's

I cannot, cannot marry you
Here's a pretty,

Ko-Ko. Ko-Ko!
The Mikado and his suite
are approaching the city -
and will be here in 10 minutes.
- The Mikado?
- Mmm.
He's coming to see
if his orders have been carried out.
Oh, I can't live without Yum-Yum. This
afternoon I perform the happy dispatch.
Now look here, you know. This is
getting serious. A bargain's a bargain.
As a man of honor and a gentleman,
you are bound to die ignominiously...
at the hands of the
public executioner.
Very well then.
- Behead me.
- Ooh!
What? Now?
Certainly. At once.
Chop it off, Ko-Ko. Chop it off.
I don't go about prepared to execute
gentlemen at a moment's notice.
Oh!
Why, I never even killed a bluebottle.
Oh, come, my poor fellow. After
all, if I don't mind, why should you?
Remember.
Sooner or later, it must be done.
Must it?
I'm not so sure about that.
What do you mean?
Why should I kill you
when making an affidavit...
...that you've been executed
will do just as well?
Here are plenty of witnesses
the lord chief justice...
...the lord high admiral,
commander-in-chief,
...secretary of state for
the Home Department...
first lord of the treasury and
the chief commissioner of police.
- Where are they?
- There they are.
They'll all swear to it. Won't you?
Am I to understand that all
of us high officers of state...
are required to perjure ourselves
to ensure your safety?
Why not? You'll be grossly
insulted, as usual.
Will the insult be cash down
or at a date?
It will be a ready
money transaction.
Oh.
Very good.
Choose your fiction,
and I'll endorse it.
Ha-ha!
Family pride.
How do you like that, me buck?
But I tell you that
life without Yum-Yum -
Oh, Yum-Yum, Yum-Yum.
Bother Yum-Yum!
Take Yum-Yum, and marry Yum-Yum. Only
go away and never come back anymore.
- Yum-Yum, are you
particularly busy? - No.
Then go along with His Grace,
the archbishop of Titipu.
- He'll marry you at once.
- But if I'm to be buried alive -
Don't ask any questions!
Do as I tell you.
- Oh, but one moment. You... - Not for
worlds. If the Mikado finds you alive...
I shall have the greatest difficulty
in persuading him I've beheaded you.
Well, now. Wait a minute.
You have to give me a chance -

A more humane Mikado
never did in Japan exist
To nobody second I'm certainly
reckoned a true philanthropist
It is my very humane endeavor
to make, to some extent
Each evil liver a running river
Of harmless merriment
My object all sublime
I shall achieve in time
To let the punishment fit the crime
the punishment fit the crime
And make each prisoner pent
unwillingly represent
A source of innocent merriment
of innocent merriment
The advertising quack who wearies
with tales of countless cures
His teeth, I've enacted
shall all be extracted
-  By terrified amateurs
- Yes!
The music hall singer attends a
series of masses and fugues and ops
By Bach interwoven
with Spohr and Beethoven
-  At classical Monday Pops
- Yes!
The billiard sharp whom anyone
catches His doom's extremely hard
He's made to dwell in a dungeon cell
On a spot that's always barred
And there he plays extravagant
matches in fitless finger-stalls
On a cloth untrue
with a twisted cue
And elliptical
Billiard balls
Yes!
My object all sublime
I shall achieve in time
To let the punishment fit the crime
the punishment fit the crime
And make each prisoner pent
unwillingly represent
A source of innocent merriment

I am honored in being permitted
to welcome Your Majesty.
I guess the object of Your Majesty's visit.
Your wishes have been attended to.
The execution has taken place.
Oh, you've had an execution, have you?
Yes.
The coroner has just handed me
his certificate.
I am the coroner.
"At Titipu,
in presence of the lord chancellor...
lord chief justice, attorney general...
secretary of state
for the Home Department...
lord mayor and...
groom of the second floor front"?
They were all present, Your Majesty.
I counted them myself.
A very good house. I wish I'd
been in time for the performance.
A tough fellow he was too,
Your Majesty.
A man of gigantic strength.
His struggles were terrific.
It was really a remarkable scene.
Describe it!
Th-Th-The criminal cried
as he dropped him down
In a state of wild alarm
With a frightful, frantic,
fearful frown
I bared my big r-right arm
I seized him by his little pigtail
And on his knees fell he
As he squirmed and struggled
and gurgled and guggled
I drew my snickersnee
My snickersnee
Oh, never shall I
forget the cry
Or the shriek that shrieked he
As I gnashed my teeth
when from its sheath
I drew my snickersnee
We know him well
He cannot tell
Untrue or groundless tales
He always tries to utter lies
and every time he fails
He shivered and shook
as he gave the sign
For the stroke he didn't deserve
When all of a sudden
his eye met mine
And it seemed to brace his nerve
For he nodded his head
and kissed his hand
And he whistled an air, did he
As the saber true
cut cleanly through
His cervical vertebrae
His vertebrae
When a man's afraid
a beautiful maid
Is a cheering sight to see
And it's, oh, I'm glad
that moment sad
Was soothed by sight of me
Her terrible tale
you can't assail
With truth it quite agrees
Her taste exact
for faultless fact
Amounts to a disease
Now, though you'd have said
that head was dead
For its owner dead was he
It stood on its neck
with a smile well-bred
And bowed three times to me
It was none of your
impudent offhand nods
But as humble as could be
For it clearly knew
the deference due
To a man of pedigree
Of pedigree
And it's, oh, I vow
this deathly bow
Was a touching sight to see
Though trunkless yet
it couldn't forget
The deference due to me
This haughty youth
he speaks the truth
Whenever he finds it pays
And in this case
it all took place
Exactly as he says
Exactly, exactly, exactly, exactly
As he says
All this is very interesting,
and I should like to have seen it.
But we came about a
totally different matter.
A year ago, my son, the heir to the throne
of Japan, bolted from our imperial court.
Indeed?
Had he any reason to be dissatisfied
with his position?
None whatever. On the contrary,
I was going to marry him.
And yet he fled.
I am surprised that he should
have fled from one so lovely.
That's not true.
No.
He's now masquerading in this town,
disguised as a second trombone.
A second trombone!
Yes. Would it be troubling you too
much if I asked you to produce him?
He goes by the name of, uh - of, uh -
- Nanki-Poo.
- Nanki-Poo.
Nanki-Poo?
Oh, not at all.
It's quite easy. Uh -
Th-That is, it's rather difficult.
In point of fact, he's gone abroad.
Gone abroad?
See here! His name!
Nanki-Poo - beheaded this morning.
Oh, where shall I find another?
Where shall I find another?
Dear, dear, dear.
This is very tiresome.
My poor fellow, in your anxiety
to carry out my wishes...
you've beheaded
the heir to the throne of Japan.
I beg to offer an unqualified apology.
I desire to associate myself
with that expression of regret.
We really hadn't the least notion.
Of course you hadn't.
How could you?
If a man of exalted rank chooses
to disguise himself as a second trombone...
he must take the consequences.
I've no doubt he thoroughly
deserved all he got.
We are infinitely
obliged to Your Majesty.
Much obliged, Your Majesty.
Very much obliged, Your Majesty.
Obliged? Not a bit. Don't mention it.
How could you tell?
No. Of course we couldn't tell
who the gentleman really was.
It wasn't written on his forehead,
you know.
It might have been
on his pocket handkerchief...
but Japanese don't use
pocket handkerchiefs.
I forget the punishment for compassing
the death of the heir apparent.
"Punishment."
Hmm. Yes. Uh -
Uh -
Something lingering,
with boiling oil in it, I fancy.
Something of that sort.
I think boiling oil occurs in it,
but I'm not sure.
And I know it's something
humorous, but lingering -
with either boiling oil
or melted lead.
Come, come.
Don't fret. I'm not a bit angry.
If Your Majesty will accept our
assurance, we had no idea -
- Of course.
- I knew nothing about it.
I wasn't there.
Unfortunately, the fool of an act says
"compassing the death of the heir apparent."
Yes.
- There's not a word in it
about a mistake. - No.
- Or not knowing.
- No!
- Or having no notion.
- No.
- Or not being there.
- No.
- There should be, of course.
- Yes.
But there isn't.
That's the slovenly way
these acts are always drawn.
Now, let's see.
About your execution -
Would after luncheon suit you?
Can you wait till then?
Oh, yes. We can wait till then.
Very well then.
We'll make it tomorrow, after luncheon.
Um, I shan't want any lunch.
Well! And a nice mess
you've got us into...
with your nodding head and "the
deference due to a man of pedigree."
Merely corroborative detail,
intended to give artistic verisimilitude...
to an otherwise bald
and unconvincing narrative.
Corroborative detail indeed.
Corroborative fiddlestick.
Oh, you're just as bad as he is...
with your cock-and-a-bull story about
catching his eye and whistling an air.
But that's so like you.
You must put in your oar.
But how about your big right arm?
Yes. And your snickersnee.
Yeah. Well, well -
Well, never mind about that now.
There's only one thing to be done.
Nanki-Poo hasn't started yet.
He must come to life again at once.
Nanki-Poo! Nanki-Poo!
- I'm a dead man, and I'm off
for my honeymoon. - Oh, wait, wait.
Nanki-Poo! Nanki-Poo!
I've good news for you.
- You're reprieved.
- Oh, but it's too late.
Nonsense.
A terrible thing has just happened.
It seems that you are
the son of the Mikado.
Oh, but that happened some time ago.
Is this a time for airy persiflage?
Your father is here -
and with Katisha.
- My father? And with Katisha?
- Yes. He wants you particularly.
Oh! So does she.
- But he's married now. - Bless me
heart. What has that got to do with it?
Well, Katisha claims me in
marriage, but I'm married already.
Consequently, she'll insist on my execution,
and my wife will have to be buried alive.
I don't know what's to be done.
There's one chance for you. If you
can persuade Katisha to marry you -
Ah, but wait.
I can then come to life without
any fear of being put to death.
I marry Katisha?
I really think it's the only course.
But, my good girl...
have you seen her?
She's something appalling.
Well, it comes to this: While Katisha is
single, I prefer to be a disembodied spirit.
When Katisha is married, existence
will be as welcome as the flowers in spring.
The flowers that bloom in the spring
Tra-la
Breathe promise of merry sunshine
As we merrily dance and we sing
Tra-la
We welcome the hope that they bring
Tra-la
Of a summer of roses and wine
Of a summer of roses and wine
And that's what we mean
when we say that a thing
Is welcome as flowers
that bloom in the spring
Tra-la-la-la-la

The flowers that bloom in the spring
Tra-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la-la-la

The flowers that bloom in the spring
Tra-la
Have nothing to do with the case
For I've got to take under my wing
Tra-la
A most unattractive old thing
Tra-la
With a caricature of a face
With a caricature of a face
And that's what I mean when I say
or I sing
Oh, bother the flowers
that bloom in the spring
Tra-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la-la-la
Bother the flowers of spring
Tra-la-la-la-la

Have nothing to do with the case

when I say or I sing
Oh, bother the flowers

Tra-la-la-la-la
Oh, bother the flowers of spring
Tra-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la-la-la-la
Katisha.
The miscreant who robbed me
of my love.
But vengeance pursues.
They are heating the cauldron.
Katisha, behold a suppliant
at your feet.
Katisha, mercy.
Mercy?
Had you mercy on him?
You have slain my love.
Well, he is dead,
and where shall I find another?
It takes years to train
a man to love me.
Where shall I find another?
Here.
Here!
What?
Katisha, for years I have loved
you with a white-hot passion...
which is slowly but surely
consuming my very vitals!
Ah, shrink not from me.
Kat -
Katisha, I dare not
hope for your love...
but I will not live without it.
Darling!
You! You, whose hands still reek
with the blood of my betrothed...
dare to address words of passion to
the woman you have so foully wronged?
I do. Accept my love,
or I perish on the spot!
Go to!
Who knows so well as I that no one
ever yet died of a broken heart.
You know not what you say.
Listen.
On a tree by a river a little tomtit
Sang
Willow, tit-willow, tit-willow
And I said to him
Dickey bird, why do you sit
Singing
Willow, tit-willow, tit-willow
Is it weakness of intellect, birdie
I cried
Or a rather tough worm
in your little inside
With a shake of
his poor little head
He replied
Oh, willow -
Tit-willow, tit-willow
He slapped at his chest
as he sat on that bough
Singing
Willow, tit-willow, tit-willow
And a cold perspiration
bespangled his brow
Oh, willow, tit-willow, tit-willow
He sobbed and he sighed
And a gurgle he gave
Then he plunged himself
into the billowy wave
While an echo arose
O'er the suicide's grave
Oh, willow
Tit-willow, tit-willow
Now I feel just as sure
as I'm sure that my name
Isn't "Willow, tit-willow,
tit-willow"
That 'twas blighted affection
that made him exclaim
Oh, willow, tit-willow, tit-willow
And if you remain callous
and obdurate
I shall perish as he did
And you will know why
Though I probably shall not
Exclaim as I die
Oh, willow
Tit-willow
Tit-willow
Ko-Ko!
Now then, we've had a capital lunch,
and we're quite ready.
Have all the painful
preparations been made?
Your Majesty, all is prepared.
Then produce the
unfortunate gentleman...
and his two well-meaning
but misguided accomplices.
Mercy for Ko-Ko.
Mercy for Pitti-Sing.
Mercy even for Pooh-Bah.
I beg your pardon. I don't think
I quite caught that remark.
Mercy even for Pooh-Bah.
My husband that was
to have been is dead...
and I have just married
this, uh, miserable object.
Oh. You've not been long about it.
No. We were married
before the registrar.
I am the registrar.
I see.
But my difficulty is that, as
you have slain the heir apparent -
- The heir apparent is not slain.
- Bless my heart. My son!
And your daughter-in-law-elected.
Traitor! You have deceived me!
Yes. You are entitled to
a little explanation...
but I think he'll give it better whole
than in pieces.
Your Majesty, it's quite true that
I stated that I had killed Nanki-Poo.
Yes, with most affecting particulars.
It's like this, Your Majesty:
When your Majesty says,
"Let a thing be done"...
that thing is as good as done -
practically, it is done -
because Your Majesty's will is law.
Your Majesty says,
"Kill a gentleman" -
Well, a gentleman is
told off to be killed.
Consequently,
that gentleman is as good as dead -
practically, he is dead.
Well, if he is dead,
why not say so?
I see. Nothing could possibly
be more satisfactory.
