So here's what you missed
on Glee.
because the New Directions
didn't win at Nationals.
And since Sue's principal and only
wants winning teams at McKinley,
Hold up.
Which means if Will wants to coach
a Glee club, he has to find a new job
- Oh, God, that's awful.
-
So I'm going to skip college,
too, and become a male model.
Impossible. You're too fat.
Funny Girl
that's about to open on Broadway
real soon. It's exciting!
Glee.
SIDNEY: Rachel, Rachel,
please, just a minute.
I'm-I'm sorry, Sidney,
I'm actually kind of late.
I have to go
and meet my friends.
Oh, that's not gonna
be a problem. Look,
I know this has been a couple
of very long months for you,
but you've been a trooper.
I mean, you know, having
to do the show on the road,
Santana quitting,
us having to re-stage
the entire play.
- I just wanted to say thank you.
- Thank you so much, Sidney.
No, no, no.
This is how I say thank you.
Is this for me?
Mm-hmm.
No more crowded subways
in New York for my star.
So...
Thank you.
Now, the only question is:
where would
Ms. Berry like to go?
Ah. Go ahead.
When you're alone
and life is making you lonely
You can always go
Downtown
When you've got worries
All the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know
Downtown
Just listen to the music
of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalk where
the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?
The lights
are much brighter there
You can forget
all your troubles
Forget all your cares so go
Downtown
Things will be great
when you're
Downtown
Everything's waiting for you
Don't hang around and let
your problems surround you
There are movie shows
Downtown
Maybe you know
some little places to go to
Where they never close
Downtown
Just listen to the rhythm
of a gentle bossa nova
You'll be dancing with 'em,
too, before the night is over
Happy again
The lights
are much brighter there
You can forget
all your troubles
Forget all your cares so go
Downtown
Where all the lights
are bright
Downtown
You're gonna be all right
Now
Downtown...
Downtown
And you may find
somebody kind
To help and understand you
Someone who is just like you
and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along
So maybe I'll see you there
We can forget
all our troubles
Forget all our cares so go
Downtown
Things'll be great
when you're
Downtown
Don't wait a minute more
Downtown
Everything's waiting for you
Downtown...
I can call him any time of day,
he's amazing.
He doesn't even say a word.
It's like living
in a high-end coffee commercial
every day.
- Unbelievable.
- So, where we going for lunch?
Someplace cheap or free?
No, it is my treat and my ride.
You guys have been so great
and so emotionally supportive
of me during the entire
out of town run.
And for your move
back to the loft,
which you never carried
your own clothes or furniture.
It's heavy.
Come on, we're going.
We're gonna go the Odeon.
Okay, like, I've been
really good lately.
- Oh, you have.
- Everyone from Broadway goes.
And it's so cool! I don't know,
probably just like...
rather than getting
a side salad.
Can we pop the trunk?
- Trunk is full.
- Can I sit in the front then?
Full, too.
Well...
Oh, it's okay. Sam and I can
just meet you there. Right, Sam?
Are you sure?
I guess.
Thank you.
We'll order an appetizer.
What? No, I ca... I can't serve you
breakfast in bed
if you're not in bed.
It's been months.
You don't have to keep doing...
Oh, that does smell good.
Lemon blueberry pancakes.
And the Sunday
Wha...? It's not even Sunday!
They put the Arts
and Leisure section
and Style section on Wednesday.
You know me so well.
Is there anything
I can do to help?
You can check
if the coffee is steeped
enough to press.
I still can't believe it.
We're really doing it.
Living together.
Building a future together.
In Bushwick.
Did you ever imagine that?
It's actually way, way better.
Every morning I get
to wake up next to you.
I get to walk you to the subway.
Then walk you to class.
And most days I get
to have lunch with you.
And even after all
of that amazingness,
I get to come home to you.
And I get to curl up in bed with
you, get under the covers...
Meanwhile the
are playing in the background.
Mm.
Wait, are we turning each other
into an old married couple?
On the contrary.
You make me feel so young
You make me feel
like spring has sprung
Every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual
The moment that you speak
I want to run and play
hide-and-seek
I want to go
and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon
You and I
We're just
like a couple of tots
Running around a meadow
Picking up
All those forget-me-nots
You make me feel so young
You make me feel
there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung, and
a wonderful fling to be flung
And even when
I'm old and gray
When I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do
Today
Because you make me
Feel so young
You
Make me young
You make me young
You make me feel there are
Songs to be sung
Lots of bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling
to be flung
And even when
I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do
Today
Because you
Make me feel so
Man, I just feel so
You make me feel so
Young
So young...
Dudes!
I just made it all the way
to the original Nathan's
at Coney Island,
now I kind of stink,
so I'm gonna shower.
Ooh, ice cream.
Good job.
Okay, I know Sam is your bestie,
but he said he'd only
be couch-surfing
- with us for a few weeks.
- I know.
It's been months, okay?
This apartment has
too many people in it.
You've got to talk to him.
I...
ARTIE:
Hey, I'm rolling here!
Watch where you're going!
Hey-hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
I know, man. I'm sorry.
My laptop's in there!
Hey!
It's the only copy of my script!
Bro, just completed Aqua
Park and Millennium Mines.
Now I'm ruling
Karts and Coasters.
It-it's amazing.
Sam, you've been sitting there
since I left this morning.
You-you've basically been
in that exact same spot
for months.
Yeah, well, Kurt's fancy
wire chairs hurt my back,
so this thing's the only thing
that's comfortable.
Look...
Uh, Kurt and I were talking.
- And, um, we just...
- You want me to move out.
I knew it. You know what?
Santana got
to stay here forever.
We don't want you to move,
per se, although it isn't
the worst idea I've ever heard.
We're just,
we're worried about you, man.
We know that work has been slow.
Try nonexistent, okay?
I've had
zero modeling auditions.
Zero.
I can't even get my
agent on the phone.
I just get
her lazy assistant Pam
who's like well, maybe
I should cut my hair
because I look
like a dirty hippie.
Well, maybe you should.
But I like it.
Okay, besides Mr. Shue said
that we shouldn't care
what people think.
We should just be ourselves.
What a load of crap, huh?
Well, Mr. Shue also said...
we should face our fears.
Remember that one?
So...
Buddy, I know this
is frustrating...
Maybe I just shouldn't
even be here, okay?
I hate New York, okay?
It's crowded, it's loud,
it smells like garbage
and everybody here is basically
paid to be rude to you.
Sometimes,
it's just easier
if you stay inside.
All right.
Get up. Get up.
I-I don't want to watch you
waste away in here
when there is so
much to do out there.
Put on a clean shirt.
That's got, like,
five kinds of stains on it.
Come on, follow me.
We're going outside.
- Come on!
-
I had a dream
so big and loud
I jumped so high
I touched the clouds
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I stretched my hands
out to the sky
We danced with monsters
through the night
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm never gonna look back
I'm never gonna give it up
Just don't wake me now
This is gonna be
the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be
the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-ife
I hear it calling
Outside my window
I feel it in my soul
The stars were
burning so bright
The sun was out
till midnight
I say we lose control
This is gonna be
the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be
the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-ife
This is gonna be,
this is gonna be
This is gonna be
It's gonna be
the best day of my life
Everything is looking up,
everybody up now
This is gonna be
the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-ife.
Hey, if you can sing in
the middle of Times Square,
you can pretty much
do anything.
I think it's time for you
to conquer this city.
I don't know why
they call it Times Square.
I don't see any clocks.
:
Every art has its instrument.
The violinist
has his violin.
The sculptor...
has his stone.
And the mime...
has his body.
Let us begin our work today
with the mime's
most heartbreaking expression
of his accursed, silent ennui:
the pulling of
the invisible rope
attached to something heavy.
Psst.
Psst.
What are you doing here?
This is a winter master class
taught by Marcel Marceau's
illegitimate son Alain.
You're-you're a freshman.
I got special permission
from Madame Tibideaux.
Turns out I'm in six
out of eight of your classes.
How is that even possible?
Stop talking!
And now we will move on
to the mime's most
tragic expression
of the pointlessness
of man's existence.
We are walking down the street,
without a worry,
a care in the world,
and suddenly we begin to notice
that we are walking in place
but we are not going anywhere.
Have you asked Sam
to move out yet?
We haven't had
a moment to ourselves.
And now,
we will stop to pick a flower.
And in front of your eyes,
the flower dies.
:
Hey.
Are you sure it's not me
who's crowding you?
No, why would you say that?
Good.
I was really worried
I was suffocating you.
So maybe after this,
we can get lunch?
'Cause then we have Theatre
History class together
and Auditioning for the
Camera class together...
And now, you are trapped
with the person next to you
in a box.
At first, the box
seems big enough
for the two of you.
But then, the box
begins to shrink.
The box where you live
because that is all
a mime can afford.
Getting smaller and smaller...
and smaller... and smaller...
and smaller.
SAM:
I'm so close to owning this town
I can practically taste it.
Yeah, that computer cost
over 1,000 bucks.
My-my credit card was in there,
my phone...
Tell him that
he was on crutches.
And...
Yeah.
Thanks so much for your help.
That's it? Any leads?
Blaine, do you have to
use the SodaStream machine
right now?
Artie's in a very fragile state.
I'm sorry about him.
He just needs his bubbles.
Hey, guys. BLAINE: Hey, Rachel.
Do you want a homemade
sparkling, sugar-free soda?
RACHEL:
Oh, no thanks.
The carbonation's
bad for my vocal cords.
But
you know what I will take?
Just some, like, hot water
with, like, a little lemon...
Thank you so much.
Rachel, you missed it.
Artie was mugged in the subway,
and now it's like an episode
of over here.
- What?
- ARTIE: Except for not at all.
- I wasn't touched, I was robbed.
- Oh, my God.
- Are you okay?
- No. Not really.
I don't know what I'm gonna do
about replacing that computer,
I need a new school ID,
and to be honest,
I don't if I'm gonna feel safe
going in the subway anymore.
I just felt so vulnerable
and I don't...
I don't know... alone.
Blaine, I'm gonna throw
that machine out the window.
I am so sorry,
but I know exactly
how you feel, okay?
When I first moved to New York,
I gave this homeless
person ten dollars
when I just meant
to give him one,
and then when I
asked for it back,
everyone hissed and
they booed at me,
and I felt so violated
and vulnerable.
Oh, wait.
So you were out nine dollars?
But look, the next day
I just got right
back on that subway,
because overcoming
experiences like that
is what makes you
a real New Yorker.
BLAINE:
Your beverage, milady.
Oh, are those Meyer lemons?
No, I can't have that.
ARTIE:
You know what, Rachel?
Don't lecture me
about being a real New Yorker
with your lemon water
and your chauffeured limousine.
You're not even a
real person anymore.
Now, if you'll just excuse me,
I have to go figure out how
to put my life back together.
It's a town car,
not a limousine.
It's a town car.
Okay?
A town car.
So I found this song
by A Great Big World
that would be perfect
for our band.
It's got a nice pop feel to it
without being
totally saccharine...
and you're not listening
to a word I'm saying.
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't get
any sleep last night.
Ooh, lucky you.
It's not like that.
Bedbugs!
And I know what I'm about to say
sounds like a bad Bravo show,
but I'm starting to
think that that couch
was an omen of
our relationship.
Seemingly fine from the outside,
but headed for certain disaster.
- Hmm.
- Does that sound crazy?
Absolutely.
Well, it's not just the couch.
I'm starting to
feel claustrophobic.
I mean, I wake up
next to Blaine,
I-I go to school
with Blaine,
I come home to Blaine.
I feel like I'm starting
to lose my identity.
Okay, well, stop me if
you don't want my opinion.
Okay, when I first heard
you were engaged,
I thought, "Hmm-mm.
Big mistake.
Too young."
But you know what?
Seeing you guys together,
I think that what
you have is real
and worth fighting for
and I'm super jealous.
Still, though,
everyone needs time alone.
It's healthy.
So just set some boundaries.
But don't forget
to rehearse with your band.
There's a girl
in the backyard
Banging on her drum
Sitting in a junk pile
Laughing at the sun, singing
Ah, ah, ah,
I just want to be a rock star
There's a boy
thinking of her
Playing his guitar
Searching for the answer
Buried in his heart
Singing ah, ah, ah
Is there anybody out there?
Ooh, yeah
Singing ah, ah, ah
Is there anybody out there?
If there's a meaning,
can you show me a sign?
The more I look
it just gets harder to find
The world is spinning
and I want to know why
And maybe we will
never figure it out
I got a feeling
that's what life's all about
I'm learning anything
is possible now
Ooh, ooh ooh
Take a ticket
and get off the line
Let's take a ticket
and get off the line
Singing ah, ah, ah
Ticket and get off the line
I was born
to be a rock star
Ticket and get off the line
Singing ah, ah, ah
Ticket and get off the line
I just want
to be a rock star
Ticket and get off the line
I was born
to be a rock star
Yeah, yeah
I was born to be a rock star
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah
I was born to be
a rock star.
Miss Berry, no worries about
the garment bags in the back.
I make sure they lie flat.
Okay, great.
Thank you.
Dmitri, where are we right now?
Uh, we're now crossing
into Chinatown.
Stop the car!
Um, sorry, I'm actually just
gonna get out right here.
BLAINE:  What better way to say
"Sorry for bringing bedbugs
Okay, is that one of those
outlines that the police use?
Did somebody die in here?
Sam, this in no way resembles
the shape of a person.
So...?
So, no, no one died in here.
What did you do to your hair?!
Oh, well, thanks to you,
I-I-I got it cut.
And then bursting
with my newfound
New York City confidence,
I went out and I booked
my first modeling job!
- What?!
- Yeah!
- That's amazing!
- I know!
Congratulations, man!
What's it for?
Bubble!
Okay.
Booty-contouring underwear
for men.
Thanks to Bubble, men can now
have that sexy,
round, onion booty
that they've always dreamed of.
I didn't even know
there was a market for that,
but that is great.
And I got you a free pair!
Oh, thank you. I, um,
can't wait to show Kurt.
The good news keeps
coming, my brother. I...
am moving out.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
You're-you're moving?
- Where you going to?
- Well, the agency's
putting me up in an apartment
with a bunch of other models.
I'm stoked.
My own place, sort of,
and you know, I'm not gonna be
taking up any more room
on the couch.
Well, you're gonna visit us,
right?
Um, yeah, if I have time,
you know.
But I-I-I might be traveling
to Paris and Milan
every week. Who knows?
I'm gonna pack everything up.
Yeah.
Hey! Oh, did you hear
Sam just got a job?
What are you doing?
Uh, this is, uh, something
I thought would make
a really great office area.
Back away from the lamp, okay?!
When someone enters
their sanctuary, they don't want
their eyes immediately drawn
to a hideous workspace!
I'm not done yet.
This isn't McKinley.
You can't just barge in here
and do whatever you want,
whenever you want, all right?
You could've at least
consulted me
before making design decisions
in my home!
I thought that this was supposed
to be home, Kurt.
And believe it or not, not
every single design decision
you make is brilliant.
This whole privacy-
curtains-between-the-bedrooms
thing is stupid. Come on.
We can hear every single noise
our roomies make at night,
and God knows
what they hear from us.
You know what?
Elliott was right,
we're losing our boundaries.
I'm sorry, Elliott?
What-What does Elliot have
to do with any of this?
We were talking.
I bet you were talking.
He's my friend.
I bet he's your friend.
Calm down, psycho, all right?
And stop being so pouty
and weird. It's annoying.
All right, let's just be
adults and put everything back
where it's supposed to go.
Okay, I got an idea.
Why don't you put it back
where it's supposed to go
because it's your apartment!
Fine! I will!
Hey, move it, kid!
-
- Who is it?
It's Blaine.
Hey, I...
Are you okay?
Oh...
Oh, God, you're not trying
to move in here, are you?
No, I'm not. We need to talk.
I don't have
your number and
I don't have your e-mail
and we're not friend on Facebook
because I made it a point
of waiting for you to friend me,
which you never did, by the way.
So here I am
face-to-face.
I just want to hear you
admit it.
Admit what?
That you're trying to steal Kurt
away from me, Starchild Gilbert!
What?!
What are you talking about?
Please, I was on to you
the second I saw
that weird cinnamon roll selfie
you took months ago.
You guys posted that.
Remember that?
I get to New York
and all of a sudden
it's "Elliott thinks this"
and "Elliott thinks that"
and "Elliott's hair
is so full and thick
that he doesn't have
to rely on hair gel."
Well, I may not be a cool
steampunk, glitter-rock vampire
with, like, tats and guyliner,
but you know what?
I love Kurt. I love him!
He's my fiancé, not
yours, so back off!
Okay, are... are you done?
Take this.
- What?
- Yeah, it's, uh, it's like a body pillow.
It think it's
gonna calm you down.
Take a seat.
Look, Blaine,
I'm not after Kurt.
We're just friends. Don't get
me wrong, I mean, he's a,
he's a cute guy, but I don't
think of him that way.
And even if I did,
Kurt loves you.
I mean, he-he doesn't
shut up about you, actually.
Like, ever.
I'm sorry. I don't know
what's going on with me.
It's just, we've been apart
for so long,
and now that I'm finally here,
I just want to catch up to him,
I just want to make it real.
And the more I try...
The more it pushes him away?
Well, maybe you should
stop trying.
I mean, look, New York
is a really crowded place,
and people need a little more
room to breathe here than usual.
You're right.
I guess I always think
of boundaries as walls
instead of places to grow in.
I'm so sorry. I-I should go.
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute.
You just got here.
You want to just hang out
for a minute?
Um...
I mean, you've obviously
come to jam.
Um... you gave me this.
"Glitter-rock vampire," huh?
I didn't mean that.
I'm sorry.
I like that.
I-I... I can work with that.
- Okay, okay, all right.
- Come on. Give me some blues.
Give me some Southern...
Come on.
Uh... um... gli...
Glitter-rock vampire
Gonna bite ya
Gonna bite ya
Gonna bite ya.
Hey.
I got your text.
Why did her Royal Highness
summon a commoner like me?
Okay, that was a little rude,
but I know I had it coming.
Look, I had an epiphany, and you
were right, okay? About everything.
I don't want to be
sheltered from the world,
I want to live in it.
So let's go.
I have rehearsal and you have class.
Let's take the subway.
- No, I can't.
- No, together.
Look, I know that you're
a little shaken up
about what happened, but trust
me, but I took Krav Maga
as a child at the JCC,
and I can protect you.
So what about the limo?
Town car. And
I gave it up.
I told my producers I'd
be in a much better place
if I rode the subway
with my friend every day.
- Every day?
- Well, if you'll have me.
Look, I will make you a deal.
I'll ride the subway
with you and make sure
that you don't get mugged again
if you give me a tongue-
lashing if I lose my way.
I can do that.
I'm really happy that
you're in New York.
The city is a much less
scarier place with a friend.
And I'm really happy you dragged
me back down here, because...
I really do love it.
You wander around
On your own little cloud
When you don't see the why
Or the wherefore
Ooh, you walk out on me
When we both disagree
'Cause to reason is
Not what you care for
Good-bye means nothing
When it's all for show
So why pretend
You've somewhere else to go
Don't sleep
in the subway, darlin'
Don't stand
in the pouring rain
Don't sleep
in the subway, darlin'
The night is long
Forget your foolish pride,
nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again
Oh
Don't sleep in the subway
Darlin'
Don't stand
in the pouring rain
Don't sleep
in the subway, darlin'
The night is long
Forget your foolish pride,
nothing's wrong
And you're beside me again.
I think there's like a dozen models
living in here,
but people take off for weeks
at a time on photo shoots,
so it never gets too crowded.
The rooms are kind of small.
Oh, that's okay;
I've been homeless.
That's cool, man.
I envy your realness.
Listen, I got to do this
paid webcam thing in my room,
but if you have any
other questions,
just ask your roommate Sam.
Wait, my roommate's name is Sam?
Okay, this couldn't get
any cooler.
- I'm sorry.
- Hi.
I'm Sam.
What?
- Hey.
- Hi.
So you went to see Elliot.
I did.
He's a good guy.
He's a good friend to you.
He's one of
the only real friends
I've made since I came here.
He texted me as soon
as you left his apartment.
Six hours ago.
So I guess
I've just been wondering
where you've been.
Well, I, um...
I actually took a water taxi
to the Statue of Liberty.
Just needed some space
so I could think.
I went to the High Line
to do the same.
Well, then can I go first?
I think I should move out.
I'm not sure that's what I want.
Me neither, but I think...
we need to take a step back
for a second together and...
just look at the situation
honestly.
It's not working out.
After graduation, I just...
moved in and we didn't have
a conversation about it.
We never weighed
the pros and cons.
We never really discussed
if this was
the absolute best thing
for our relationship.
We just wanted to be us.
Together.
And-and we are together.
We are so together,
but I just think that maybe...
living together
in less
than ideal circumstances...
Maybe we don't need
that pressure right now.
I mean, it's such
a scary decision to make.
I-I just, I feel like I-I...
I know, I know.
It is scary,
but I think it's
a little less scary if...
we make the decision together.
We can't go backwards.
We're not going backwards.
I think we're...
being smart.
By protecting something
that is very precious to me.
You know that, right?
Of course I know that.
Of course.
Always. I know.
And no matter who we become,
even if we do need alone time...
which is completely valid...
we'll always belong
to each other.
And even though
this-this wasn't a fight,
this was just, you know,
a grown-up, adult conversation...
you know, we are now
going to have
the hottest makeup sex ever.
Okay.
: It never hurts
to sing when you're going on a casting.
You do the best impressions!
That's so Kathy Ireland.
Huh.
Okay, now do Gisele.
No, I should probably, uh... I
should probably get some sleep.
I-I got a big follow-up photo
shoot with, uh, Bubble tomorrow.
The wonderbutt undies?
Oh, my God, Sam!
Congratulations. That's great.
- Thanks.
- Okay, well, look,
use these.
I swear by it.
It keeps your body
from retaining water.
I have Adderall if you want.
Oh, if you have trouble
sleeping, Marla has Ambien.
I prefer Lunesta.
My schedule's been
so cray lately.
But don't take
whatever Gavin has.
He says it's clenbuterol,
but I swear
it's like pig tranquilizers.
Sorry. I got to go.
You don't have anything
for anxiety, do you?
I don't, uh... don't think
I can stay here.
I hate everything.
Sam?
RACHEL:
Oh, my God, you guys
are not gonna believe what
happened to me and Artie today.
- Sam? - ARTIE: Sam, come here.
Listen to this.
I know this is going to sound
like one of those crazy
New York stories,
and I wouldn't believe it myself
if it hadn't just happened,
but I swear...
- Just tell us.
- Okay, right.
So, Rachel and I
were riding the L-Train.
Take a little nap right now.
- Oh, my God, it's him.
- Who?
The guy who mugged me.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
Shut up.
Okay, so then, we see this guy,
and he's, like, inching
towards this super sweet,
elegant, elderly-looking
lady, who'd obviously,
like, had a little
bit of work done,
but it was very tasteful. Just,
like, right around her eyes.
And this guy was eyeing
her gorgeous Hermès Birkin bag.
And then...
- It's pepper spray.
- Let me do it.
Go! Be careful.
I cut him off and sprayed him
right in the eye.
God, I felt so vindicated.
RACHEL:
It was amazing.
And when we got off the subway,
we found out that this
guy got arrested, and
it turns out that
he's, like, a mugger,
slash, hoarder, so all this
stuff was just at his apartment.
Yeah, and the cops
found my laptop!
- It's amazing.
- Great.
You're like a real
life Professor X.
Yeah.
It's so great.
That was pretty amazing.
BLAINE:
Well, Kurt and I
have had a bit of a big day
ourselves, actually.
Well, it wasn't
as dramatic as that.
Well, it-it was...
it was pretty dramatic.
Um, we decided
that I'm going to move out.
- Shut up!
- Really?
Don't worry.
We're not breaking up.
Oh, no, no, no, far from it.
We actually think this is gonna
strengthen our relationship.
Yeah, I said
he needs to discover the city
the same way I got to.
You know,
find his favorite neighborhood,
find his favorite pizza place.
You know, have
some time and space
to explore and grow
and find out who he is here.
BLAINE: And to that
end, my first thought
is that I'm a guy
that wouldn't mind crashing
on Sam's couch
in his new apartment.
I actually... I actually don't
have a new apartment anymore.
Um, I moved out.
That place... it
wasn't it for me.
I'm not saying I'm giving up
my dream of being a model.
I still want that
more than ever.
I just... I want to
do it the right way
with, you know, no puking,
pills and eating cotton balls.
BLAINE:
Well, that's good.
Maybe we can find
a place together.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- Up top?
- Yeah.
- Guess who's taking over New York?
-
- What?! - I mean, this day
couldn't get any better.
It could not get any better.
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I missed you guys.
Okay, that's it.
You're never leaving now.
Just ring it a little bit
to the right. Oh, my gosh, this
apartment is so cute. I'm so
happy that Mercedes is here.
Well, technically,
she's not here,
which is why
we're doing all the work.
And where is she?
BLAINE:
She's inside
with Sam... alone.
Oh, dear God.
I mean, you know, L.A.'s okay
if you like sunshine
all the time, which I don't.
- Yeah.
- It makes me squint.
Then I got to thinking
about all of you guys
and all the fun that
you must be having.
And I ain't ashamed to say it.
Got a little lonely out there.
I missed you.
Well, I miss everyone.
- Even Rachel? - :
Yes, even Rachel.
That girl...
she keeps my head in the game.
So I told the producers
that my album
needed an East Coast, Harlem,
bebop, uptown kind of vibe.
You know, I don't have any idea
what that means, but
the suckers bought it.
I love the Harlem bebop.
So here I am.
Two bedrooms and a refrigerator.
That's so cool.
It's crazy.
So, uh, what are you gonna...
what are you gonna do
with the other room?
Oh, well, you know,
I was thinking
of storing my hair
for my weaves in there.
But then I got to thinking,
maybe I should rent it out
to a couple of nerds I
knew back in high school.
You know, but Blaine
and I need a place,
so, you could just,
you know, rent to us.
- Oh, you were talking about us.
- Yes, I was.
Well, listen, that's great. That's amazing.
I heard that. Yeah.
Yeah. Ah.
Uh, what are we, uh...?
But what are we gonna do about
the... our sexual chemistry?
'Cause it's...
Uh-uh. No. Been there,
done that. No, Sam.
Okay, yeah, just friends,
just friends.
Yeah. This looks
good, though.
All right, fine.
Yeah, just friends.
- That's a good call. That's
a good call. - Mm-hmm.
Just, uh...
I will bite your wax lips off.
Listen, we play by my
rules, or not at all.
Okay?
Oh, yeah.
Can you tighten that up?
It's a little loose.
Some people just don't
know how to screw things.
Come on.
I really wish
I could be helping you guys.
Oh, don't worry about it,
Artie. We know you would help.
Rachel, on the other
hand... I don't know.
What? I'm texting
my publicist.
: That was a
joke, but I do have to go!
We're doing sound and mic
checks now at the theatre.
Are we still on
for dinner tonight
for our annual Monday night
because-it's-my-only-night-off
dinner?
Let's do a potluck,
'cause I'm not cooking
- for everybody.
- Okay. I'm so excited.
This is going to be
a great new tradition!
I'm gonna go and get pies
now for everyone.
Taxi!
Taxi! Hey!
God, I love her style.
God, I need a break.
People
People who need people
Are the luckiest people
In the world
We're children
Needing other children
And yet letting
our grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children
Than children
Lovers
Are very special people
They're the luckiest people
In the world
With one person
One very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half,
now you're whole
No more hunger and thirst
But first be a person
who needs people
People who need people
Are the luckiest people...
In the world...
