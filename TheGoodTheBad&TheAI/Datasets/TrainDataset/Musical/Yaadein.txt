Back in India, after 25 years
in London, yet pure Hindustani
London...
A home there...
a home here
Shalini
Happy birthday, my love
The priest gave me a garland of flowers...
for your portrait
But garlands are for those
who have departed
But you haven't departed, you're with me...
with me, every moment
No, no news of Sanya
It's past three am
Let me check out the house once again
Where have you been?
- Friend's birthday
I went out for a party.
- You know what time it is?
Aren't you ashamed? For four hours,
I've been looking for you
Why? I'm not a kid! Go to bed, Papa.
We'll talk in the morning
Why not now?
You've been drinking alcohol?
- Not alcohol. Just wine
I told you! Let's talk
in the morning
Else I'll complain to the police,
I'll report you
Are you out of your mind?
For the children, I'm no friend...
unless I have answers for their questions
Drinking coke, in the store?
- Why not?
I know it's your weakness,
I've stocked up on Coke
Not one, I have two weaknesses.
One's this, the other is...
your soft, lovely tresses
Besides, this is the best coolant
for my hot head
Coolant for your hot head is also
this. Look at this greeting card
Sanskrit shloke
The only time I heard Sanskrit,
was the only time I spoke Sanskrit
And that was during my wedding,
and then the priest...
recited the mumbo-jumbo
and thence on...
to Buckingham, Birmingham, and all over
You are the scholar,
you are the Oxford professor
Better you translate that for me
Meaning...?
Till the age of five,
children are to be loved
After they turn ten, you ought
to keep an eye on them
Once that have reached sixteen,
you ought to make friends with them
Get that, love? At sixteen, make
friends. That's if you want...
a happy home, forever
Old hat.
- Also today's new message
Striking a friendship with my daughters!
For a father like me!
In an alien land...
Return the trolley.
I'll be in the car
Sorry, we're switching off life support
How can this be?
The doctor gives me only
No love, I'm with you
In 25 years, I haven't even taken
a breath without depending on you
You've taken care of everything...
what am I to do?
The homes, the daughters...
how am I to take care of them?
What will I talk to them about?
You will...
you are their mother, Papa too
Just promise me one thing.
- Tell me, love
Till they are married,
don't stay away from them...
be friends with them
How will I do it, love?
Ever since they have grew up...
I haven't even had a simple
conversation with them
Remember that Sanskrit shloke?
Yes
Give happy farewells to our three daughters
Understand them...
give them understanding
There! I've slapped you.
Come to the police
Report me
If not with me, your friend of 25 years...
with whom will you open up?
You're my kin. Before who else,
can I bare my heart?
Stop bickering over every small thing
So what if they're daughters?
The world is full of daughters
If he can't, well he can't
If you're my son's best friend,
why can't you be best friends...
with your daughters?
- L.K... daughters are different
What will you do then?
I'm thinking of returning to India,
for a change of enviromnent
For a father, playing mother is tough
Kids these days!
Ever since he was a child...
I put Ronit away in a hostel
That's why I left mine in Lahore.
Kids, stay where you belong
Beat me up. Give me a bad beating.
I had gone crazy
No my baby, you're my best
Papa, we three have promised never
to make you unhappy, never to fight
It's all my fault children,
it's all my fault
Now I understand what a great friend
your mother was to you
The father is merely the provider
of money, comforts
But the mother...
like a friend, she shares
your woes, your sorrows
I tried
Yes, I tried, but I failed...
to understand you, your feelings
No Papa. Now that Ma is gone,
you are our friend
We'll do whatever you say
For me today, the only true East
where the sun rises, is my India
The departure of my dear friend Raj
for India, leaves London deserted
My friend, he's gone.
- Start worrying about your son
Off he goes to India, right behind Raj?
Simple sweetheart. For him,
Raj is father, mother and friend
Sure! You and I aren't
his parents at all
We are, only for namesake
Ronit is the son of Raj and Shalini,
in thought, in mind, in nature
Which is why, he's so middle-class
And he leaves this palatial house
and sets up studio! Dance, music...
Mohobbat.com!
- An artiste, he's an artiste
Indian music ties millions of
Asian Indians across the world...
in a single thread
The end of all quarrels over
race and creed? Indian music
Teaches one language to Punjabis,
Marathis, Gujaratis, Bengalis...?
Makes every Indian a global Indian...?
For friendships, love, marriages...
Iog on to our dotcom,
cdguru.com
Ronit, Raj uncle called for you.
He has emailed too. Read it
After Coke-Mohobbat.com...
we aren't accepting sponsorships for
anything less than 500,000 dollars
If they agree, okay
Sorry for coming away to India without
telling. Lalit will tell you why
Sorry pal, I had too.
You must've understood
Pointess telling you that we miss you.
We keep talking about you
Just today I was telling
Isha and Avantika...
about the incident in your college,
when Shalini and I were visiting you
You had just been awarded the trophy
for the best student in the college
You sidetracked Lalit and Nalini,
and you headed straight for me
You forgot your parents and
you touched Shalini's feet
Lalit was so jealous! I remember.
And it made Shalini double-happy
With memories like these we're trying
to sette down to our new lives
In any case, Isha is returning
to London to complete her studies
Take care of yourself, Ronit.
Your best friend, Uncle Raj.
"Loves..."
"griefs..."
"tales..."
"words"
"Words are forgotten"
"Memories return"
"Memories cherished,
of beloved ones..."
"return once they're gone"
"Life, my darling..."
"is like flowing water"
"After the water has flown..."
"what remains?"
"Memories"
There are loves
There are griefs
There are tales
There are words
Words are forgotten
Memories return
Memories of the loved ones come back
once they have departed
Oh these memories...
alas memories...
"All of us, in our worlds..."
"long for our memories"
"Some happinesses,
bits of sorrows..."
"they belong to us, we belong to them"
"Memories..."
"sweet memories"
"bittersweet memories..."
"of loves..."
"of griefs..."
"of tales..."
"of words..."
"of words forgotten..."
"but memories return..."
"memories cherished,
of beloved ones..."
"returning once they're gone"
New York, Mr Black
Our shares were down till yesterday,
not today. Just you watch...
by Monday next, they're going
to peak. Yes, we're praying...
to the Goddess of Fortunes. Now
she will grace my home
You tell that to those mutual funds
Join us for the prayers
Your uncle is very angry.
Come, say the prayer
An artiste! That's what your son is.
Does he know how important it is...
to propitiate the Goddess of Fortunes?
- How could I? Till last year...
you were trying to propitiate
the Goddess of Bounty
Worship didn't bear fruit.
Therefore... change
The pundits say that he fell foul
of the Goddess of Fortunes last year
Worship done, She will be placated.
- The Goddess has been invoked
Seek and you shall be given
Really?
- Seek, then see
Do I speak out what I seek?
As you wish
O'Goddess of Fortunes...
You are the Mother of all
The mighty, the lowly, the rich,
the poor, are all devoted to You
The millions of poor in India worship You
Then why do You not go there
to eradicate their poverty?
Over here, we are all so rich.
What use Your staying here?
O'Mother, desert the rich, go to the poor
All of India awaits Thee
Actually we're all fine here.
Quite fine
All we need are Your blessings
Ma, I'm going to call Uncle Raj.
Go on with the prayers
Saw your son's insolence?
That's the result of...
not keeping children on a leash
You should be ashamed! Such insolence?
- Because I said the truth?
God isn't meant to be propitiated for
purposes. A prayer should be heartfelt
Where to, now?
- To Uncle Raj
Your friend, he is.
But his heart, I know
Just think. After all these years
abroad, what drives him homeward...
is sheer agony. If we aren't the ones
to share his sorrows, who else will?
Nalini, who bore Ronit?
You, or Shalini?
Oh brother-in-law...!
Your mother always said that after
all of you were married off...
she wanted both of us to retire,
and come to live in India...
here, in this farm house. And when
it's about time, she leaves, saying...
Not their Papa, be their friend "Papa"
Ma was 500 percent right!
- Papa, where did you first meet her?
And who said "I love you" first?
You or Mamma? Please, tell us
I did
Tell us, when did Mummy say
"I love you" for the first time?
You're going too far.
On one hand, you want to be Papa-friend!
On the other hand, just look at you...
Can you tell me, what if someone
says something romantically...?
What romance? The fellow
who does that gets slapped
Just get married and push off
What Papa means is that
if something like that happens...
first of all, we'll tell Papa
Today, on my birthday, let's give each
other a promise as friends. An agreement
Didn't get that.
- No need to get worked up
What I mean to say is,
sometime or the other...
somewhere or the other, there will
surely come into your lives...
a boy who wants to marry you,
whom you want to marry
What's wrong with that Papa?
- When did I say anything's wrong?
All I'm saying is, you have every
right to marry, and I'll concede too
But...
remember one thing. The right to choose
the family he comes from...
will be mine, completely mine.
You'll give me so much, won't you?
Why Papa?
- How naive, my child!
You won't be marrying only the boy
You will be marrying into the family
The entire family. Right?
Papa is absolutely right!
Condition accepted, what?
Today, let's make a promise
to ourselves, as friends
To talk from the heart, with an open mind
Let's be a well-knit,
friendly family
Avantika rustes up the fries
and the sweets, fast!
No fries, no sweets. First,
give us a song
Which song?
- Our favourite one
You left me all alone and came to India
I know you would come
You come to India, you forget!
Not even a phone call...?
Idiot, remember me?
All forgotten
Our memories,
Coke-Mohobbat.com
The whole world has turned into
one dotcom, which draws closer...
Indians in every corner of the world
Those who don't want to fall in love,
can get married straightaway
How come?
- Consider yourself. Assuming...
we are to choose for you, a handsome worthy
Our "Shaadi.com" can tell you where
and how to find the most suitable boy
Now you come to the point! Tell us.
- Computer, advise us where to find...
a suitable, handsome boy,
the right match for Avantika
Here you are
I like all three
Let's get all three married off
The boy in the middle is Pankaj.
Pankaj Kudesia. I know him
How come?
- We studied together In London
Presenty, he's a vice president
with Hotel Surya in Delhi
He was in London, but he stayed Indian
Well Avantika?
- Not I
There's a boy for Sanya too.
Take a look
Find someone for our Isha too
Scan Isha into the computer
Here we go
What was that?
Talk to the groomspeople clearly, openly
You know Isha, I can't take this
"Hahn-ji, Nan-ji" small-talk
What scant pluck I have is because
I have Ronit with me. Else...
What can Ronit do? He's a baby.
Elders talk to each other
Stop depending on him.
- But I...
TIMEOUT: 01:37:36:05 Not buts to yourself
Mr Raj, Ronit is to me
what my son Pankaj is
Ronit has told us everything
about Avantika. All I wanted...
was to meet you. Now we've met.
- Me too... what I wanted...
What I wanted, Ronit...
- What he wanted was to meet you...
and ask you... you know wedding matters
...if you have any conditions, demands
Exacty! Whatever it be, be sure
to ask. I'll fulfill everything
Decent parents, a good girl and
a simple wedding... my 3 conditions
Nothing more.
- Yes, and have nothing to worry
At home with us, Avantika won't face
the slightest hardship
That's exacty what I meant
Well, have I been talking excessively?
- Not a question of excesses
All I've been trying to tell him
is to make a clean breast
One colour, you know.
Differing shades create problems
Black or white. If it's black,
let it be black, completely
If it's white, let it be all-white.
But some people will ruin...
the best of situations, trying
to mix black with white
That's where the confusion arises,
and confusion leads to problems
And for every problem, finding
a solution is tough, if handy
Thanks to good company, we have a solution
One must be alert, but no problem...
everything can be solved
How about tea or something?
It's been quite long
How long have you been working here?
- Uncle Khama isn't a servant...
he's Daddy's friend of 35 years.
He owns a golf club
As good as servant. Mohanlal demands
loyalty from his friends
Enough! Let me leave before
another faux pas
And look at my litte master staring me down
Because of your cross-matched socks
"What riddle is this?"
"Why are such strange things
happening?"
"My restessness..."
"My restessness, my loneliness"
"In my restessness I am so lonely"
"What strange breeze blows
this year?"
"Try as much as I will,
but my feet are unsteady"
"Why do these thoughts
cross my heart...?"
"When I see my friends
wearing the hema...?"
"Makes me wish I could wear it too"
"What riddle is this?"
"Why are such strange things
happening?"
"The days are too short,
these nights too long"
"Before the monsoons it has begun raining"
"In my dreams I have met someone"
"Go away! Don't teach me
these strange things"
"The two of you have killed me"
"What riddle is this?"
"Why are such strange things
happening?"
"This is no picture, this is a message"
"From far away, someone
sends you greetings"
"He's handsome, he has a cute name"
"And good friends bring hearts close"
"One of you is to be a bride"
"What riddle is this?"
"Why are such strange things
happening?"
Cycles have brakes, you know?
- Off to London without a bye-bye?
But I met everyone.
- Except me, idiot
Didn't think it necessary.
Idiot, you were busy working out
I would've missed my plane.
Hey, did you miss me?
Not at all!
On the day of the wedding, Papa gave
me a gift for you. I forgot about it
Here's your message
Your gift. From Papa. Not from me.
- From Papa?
You can put it on, can't you?
I've seen two nice boys
on my "shaadi.com"
One for Sanya, one for you
For me?
Why?
- I don't want to marry
Until when?
- Until college is over
And afterwwards?
- I'll do whatever Papa says
Marriage, or love-marriage?
- I don't believe in love
I know. But why?
Romantics are useless.
They're filmi
In real life, love's an entertaimnent
package that comes with youth
When girls like you fall in love,
great love stories are made
Girls like me only make history,
not love stories
Remember, there will come the day,
when a handsome young man...
will move you to tears.
That day, your love story begins
That will happen, that will surely happen
I ask you, who is this boy?
Who is he?
Papa, he's Sukant. I've known him
for a year. He lives in Delhi
And I'm in love with him.
- But I've seen him...
in the company of ruffians.
Outside our house in London
Yes Papa, but Sukant is very good at heart
Besides, we've decided to marry.
- So decisions have been taken already?
Then who needs me?
At least I should have the right
to choose my husband
Oh! Love-romance.com...?
Look, your daughter loves our son.
- And our son loves us both
He's our only son. We got him educate
in London, and he's just back
You know Mr Raj, we received
so many proposals for our son
But we refused all of them.
- In this case, the kids are in love
Hang love! My son is a gem
Your daughter is lovely too.
She'd be lovelier if she wore clothes
Mamma please, don't overdo it.
- I'm not! This concerns marriage
We ought to talk openly, yes Mr Raj?
- Even I want you to talk openly
I'm open!
We aren't lusting for a dowry.
- We have no objection...
to whatever you wish to give
your daughter, no objection at all
We don't want suits, clothes, nothing!
- But the wedding venue must be...
a five-star hotel. Hotel Surya!
Those with a standing do it in style
The relationship doesn't end with
the wedding. The exchange continues...
even after the wedding.
- After the wedding begins...
the real relationship.
Comings-goings keep happening
But we aren't greedy, not at all
Uncle, you haven't eaten anything...?
- No son, not hungry. I'm in a hurry
That's all?
I enjoy this
I don't understand! Who am I to marry?
Sukant or his family?
That's what I'm trying to tell you
again and again! After the wedding...
you aren't going to be called
neither Juliet-in-love nor Mrs Sukant
After the marriage, you'll be called,
sister-in-law, daughter-in-law, aunt...
and you will have to live up to all
those relationships. And his family...
isn't worthy of you!
- You just don't want me to be happy
This I've come to know. But I've taken
the decision about my life. Period
Then hear out my decision too
Saw that? Heard that?
I've got to know everything.
Let me talk to her
For a father, handling daughters
is so problematic
Where do they come from?
Leave me! I don't want to live!
Why are you crying?
- Sanya doused herself with kerosene
She's trying to set herself afire!
Leave me! Let me die!
I want to go to my mother!
Have you gone out of your mind?
- If not yourself, think of us...
think of Papa! Do you know
what you're doing?
Does anyone care for me?
I don't want to live
Sanya! You've gone crazy?
- Yes! I'm crazy!
Leave her
Let her be
Sanya, what is the matter?
You aren't my Papa!
- Sure, I'm not
You aren't!
- No, I'm not
Come here, and listen to me.
Over there... listen...
I tried to make you see reason,
but you won't see reason
It will be as you want
You're going to marry the man you want
Sukant.
- Yes Sukant. But remember one thing
The future of this marriage
is solely your responsibility
I'll manage
Avantika, Isha, let's
prepare for the wedding
Delhi-folks...
folks with a heart...
Salaams from the heart
So finally, today,
Sanya and Sukant's love triumphs
What a thing love is!
At some point of time or the other,
somewhere or the other...
everyone without exception
has fallen in love
Some have been consummated,
some loves have gone unrequited
But love lives on
In the name of love, we the youngsters,
have decided that tonight's song...
isn't mine. I'm not singing
Uncle Raj sings
Amazed, Uncle Raj?
"Some years ago friends,
there was talk..."
"of me falling in love with someone"
"We too had a first meeting"
"I too fell in love with someone"
"In the rains, on the streets..."
"holding an umbrella, I was going,
she was coming... like this"
"We crashed into each other,
we were embarrassed"
"We said, please forgive me,
what we meant was..."
"Give me your heart"
"Romance happened
...by chance"
"We became lovers, but we had litte time"
"In a hurry, I give my heart,
I call the priest..."
"I sit on a horse, I become bridegroom"
"I become the bridegroom"
"So beautiful ..."
"So beautiful was the night when we wed"
"Oh yes, I too fell in love with someone"
"Some years ago friends,
there was talk..."
"of me falling in love with someone"
"Had she been here tonight..."
"she would've played the dholak"
"She would've been happy"
"She would've kissed her girl"
"She would've blessed you,
she'd ward off the evil eye"
"She would've sung a song of love"
"Oh wouldn't she have
have made me burn..."
"in fires of jealousy"
"But everything is changed,
everything's changed"
"There was a day when I wept like rain"
"Oh yes, I too fell in love with someone"
"Some years ago friends,
there was talk..."
"of me falling in love with someone"
"Loves..."
"griefs..."
"tales..."
"words"
"Words are forgotten"
"Memories return"
"Memories..."
"Memories cherished,
of beloved ones..."
"return once they're gone"
Papa! What are you doing?
How's Isha?
Isha is away in Malaysia, for a cycle race
You know, in London,
Uncle Ranbir Rai has been named...
best businessman of the year.
It was on tvv
Congratulations Mr Rai
Congratulations Mrs Rai
Malhotra, you're wonderful!
- How come?
No sooner than I get the award,
you've thrown a party for me
I have given you my hand
in friendship, never to let go
You haven't sampled my friendship yet
Raj keeps praising you to the skies.
- Raj is like a son
I've known him since he was a baby.
- His daughter's wedding...
we couldn't attend.
- You know, business matters...
Monishka hasn't come?
- There she is, with your son
American Indians and British Indians
I keep visiting your cdguru.com
There are more dotcoms.
Dosti.com, mohobbat.com, shaadi.com
Right from friendship to love?
- And from love to marriages
Marriages? How boring
What does the pair look like?
What programme for tomorrow evening?
- Tomorrow, I'm flying to Malaysia
To cover the Asian Cycle Race.
- Cycle race?
Yes, big race
Isha is here too?
- I know
But she doesn't know I'm here.
- But where's she?
Son, you can't even see her.
Only I can see her
Today's the first day
of the Asian Cycle Race
Companies from 21 countries
have sent their best racers here
Sunday, the biggest day
of this event will see...
Preeti Sawhney of Dubai participating.
She is an Indian, and she has won...
this race the last two times,
consecutively. This year too...
there seems to be no competition
for her in sight
Let's introduce you
to Isha Puri from London
Where are you from?
- England
Where from, originally?
- India
Your name?
- Isha
Your goal?
- Always number one
You have a boyfriend?
You don't believe in love?
Not at all.
- What about affairs?
Are you crazy?
- No
Trying to make a fool out of me?
- And make a fool out of a fool?
A childhood love...
Never expected you'd crop up here.
- Just dropped by
I knew you'd be here.
- Papa must've told you
Also true. But you had to be here,
you're the cycle-event star
I'm just a small-time
reporter here
Look Ronit, don't mind.
I'd like to be independent here
Far from the world, far from home.
- And far from me...?
Maybe, too.
- Yes...?
So in this event, you and I...
strangers
Yes, strangers
Come on, only an hour to go for the heats
Wait, wait, wait...
Soft fingers...
warm hands...
and solid wrists.
You can be the only one
I could stop a race to hear that compliment
If you've said I'm best,
I'll become the best
Now the race starts!
Preeti, I like your nature.
- I like everything about you
Pass-Pass. Want some?
Look, plying him with Pass-Pass
to get close
My belt is a bit too tight
Look! Undoing her belt
How will I win tomorrow's race?
What happened?
Papa! I don't want to live in
Sukant's house! It's Hell, not home
His mother is so abusive!
His father keeps cursing me
Sukant takes sides with his mother!
They're scum!
I've thought it over,
I want a divorce, that's all
You were right, Papa
All this about being in love is
a lot of nonsense. Isha was right
Relax, you're home, aren't you?
Come on, my child
There goes Preeti Sawhney, full steam
All eyes, all bets on Preeti Sawhney
Preeti Sawhney, going great guns
Tailing her, Isha Puri, trying her best
Isha Puri of Hero Cycles
wins the Asian Championships
It's the fire in the heart
that takes you to victory
That dig was for you.
- She's the heroine
A few words for our dotcom?
Yes, I'm not saying thank-you
to anyone. It's my grit...
my determination that has led me
to my victory. And God's grace
No one takes any credit
And these tvv websites are full of
half-truths. Please don't trust them
Congratulations
But wimers aren't so vainglorious.
- Then losers are?
You go to your Ms Pass-Pass
I see... you are...
That was just a joke...
- Look Mr Stranger...
I'd like to say something straight.
Tomorrow friends and I...
are visiting Tuba Island.
No need to pursue me
Ronit, Tuba Island is full
of dangerous beasts
Stop her
Wait! We're leaving Isha behind
Isha is on Tuba Island! In trouble!
- Her friends have deserted her...
Any news of Isha?
- Oh yes, lots of news
Just because of your heroine,
our hero is in trouble
Even cellphones aren't working here
Last night, the doctors
nearly gave up on Ronit
I got to see him.
- You're supposed to rest
Maybe you don't appreciate it,
but what he did was unimaginable
How's Ronit?
- Out of danger
Remember I told you,
there'll be tears in your eyes?
What's this?
Let go
Let go of my hand
I told Sanya that when my mother
loses her temper, she just flares up
And Sanya talks back at her. Straight.
- Whatever I said is justified
I don't want to stay in that house.
- And I'm in a fix. For no reason
Sukant is here for Sanya.
- I'll find a house once I have a job
I can't live with his mother. Period
Things don't work out this way, Sanya
Look son, I understand everything.
Just wait a while
You decided on this marriage
between yourselves
You must find the solutions for yourselves
When hearts meet...
flowers blossom
When hearts meet, flowers blossom
When flowers blossom, hearts meet
Hearts meet...
flowers blossom
"Oh, love's fires"
"When the flames of passion are lit,
storms rage in the seas of the heart"
"The earth is shaken, skies rent asunder"
"Love's ruination too,
love is a prayer too"
"Some pray for love, some curse"
"When hearts meet..."
"flowers blossom"
"When hearts meet, flowers blossom"
"When flowers blossom, then hearts meet"
"Oh, love's fires"
"Ever since you..."
"came into my heart"
"Life has been..."
"so difficult"
"Even amidst revellers
I am lonely..."
"in loneliness I revel"
"This is a world of our love,
come embrace me"
"Put an end to this suffering"
"Whatever you wish..."
"let us do, oh let's do"
"Right here, right now..."
"oh let me die"
"Our hearts..."
"oh dear sweet hearts..."
"with memories..."
"let us fill"
"Let hearts meet"
"Let hearts meet, let flowers blossom"
"Some pray for love, some curse"
"Some curse, some pray"
Lies! All lies
Lies, everything! Friendship...
this love, romance, all lies
All deceptions! What a mistake I made,
conceding! You lied to me
A father can never be
his daughter's friend...
he can never be
How I wish I had never given my consent
Everyone is in Udaipur, and here you
are, still. It's so late. Now go on
Your friend's silver jubilee
wedding amiversary! Isha and Ronit...
are hosting a grand show, and you...?
- But...
No buts. I know you're worried
about Sanya. I'll take care of her
Please, don't tell anyone
about Sanya, not even Isha
Why spoil the party? VIPs from
all over the world are there
Rajasthan, Udaipur is home for me.
What I don't understand is...
how you chose the Maharajah's palace
for the party from faraway London?
It's my son Ronit's idea.
Preparations for the party...
the music, the celebrations are all
being organised by Ronit and Isha
But you haven't introduced Ronit to us.
- Oh yes, where's Ronit? Call him
Ronit, don't force me to dance
at the party. I don't know dancing
Who else is going to dance with me?
- Latch on to some butterfly
Lots of them flying about. You love
flattering them, don't you? Do that
What are you staring at?
- Your eyes
Just keep sitting
Ever since we met, we've been friends
Today we're lovers.
Tomorrow...
- Tomorrow...?
Just you and I, together...
- Just us?
Just us
Where are you my friend?
Your friend is here
Go to Papa
Okay, I'm off
You'll talk to Papa, won't you?
About what?
- Don't you know?
Oh yes! I'll tell him,
get Isha married off fast
If she falls in love with someone,
it could be a problem, no?
Got you
