Ohh.
Come on, Toto.
She isn't coming yet, Toto.
Did she hurt you?
She tried to, didn't she?
Come on, we'II go teII UncIe Henry
and Auntie Em.
Auntie Em. Auntie Em.
Auntie Em. Just Iisten
to what Miss GuIch did to Toto.
Dorothy, pIease.
We're trying to count.
But Aunt Em. She hit him over the--
Oh, don't bother us now, honey.
This oId incubator's gone bad...
...and we're IikeIy to Iose
a Iot of our chicks.
Oh, the poor IittIe things.
AII right, come on now, Iet's go.
There you go.
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Thanks, Jer.
Auntie Em, Miss GuIch said
she was gonna take Toto away.
She said
she was gonna get the sheriff.
-Dorothy, pIease.
-Oh, aII right.
Oh. Oh. Oh!
Dorothy.
DOROTHY:
Oh, get me out of here.
-Are you aII right, Dorothy?
-I'm aII right.
Tom, Jerry. Thanks ever so much.
What's aII this jabberwopping
when there's work to be done?
Thank you, boys. I'm much obIiged.
Auntie Em, you know what Miss GuIch
said she was gonna do to Toto?
Now, Dorothy, dear, you aIways get
yourseIf into a fret over nothing.
Just heIp us out today and find yourseIf
a pIace where you won't get into troubIe.
Yes, ma'am. Come on, Toto.
Boys, I know you two Iike to tussIe,
but wiII you promise me something?
Promise me you'II be friends
and work together...
...to keep an eye on Dorothy.
PIease, boys, you're awfuIIy good
at Iooking after her.
She needs someone to protect her,
and Toto, too.
Promise me you'II do that.
Thank you, boys.
Now, you stay cIose to Dorothy.
Do you suppose
there is such a pIace, Toto?
There must be.
It isn't a pIace you can get to
by a boat or a train.
It's far, far away.
Behind the moon. Beyond the rain.
Mr. GaIe. I want to see you and your wife
right away about Dorothy.
GULCH: That dog is a menace
to the community.
I'm taking him to the sheriff
to make sure he's destroyed.
DOROTHY:
No, no. I won't Iet you take him.
You go away, you wicked oId witch.
We can't go against the sheriff,
Dorothy.
Put him in the basket, Henry.
UncIe Henry, Auntie Em,
don't Iet her take Toto.
Don't Iet her take him.
What in the worId?
I know you two.
You're that Tom and Jerry
from the GaIe farm.
I'II teach you to get in my way.
Take that.
And that.
Get off.
Get off.
I'II get you, Tom and Jerry.
And that IittIe dog, too.
Toto, you came back.
Oh, I'm so gIad.
Miss GuIch
wiII be coming back for you.
We've got to get away.
We've got to run away.
HUNK:
It's a twister, it's a twister.
HENRY:
Get the horses up.
Dorothy.
Dorothy.
Jiminy Crickets. Thanks again.
Come on.
EM:
Dorothy.
Dorothy, where are you?
HENRY: It's too Iate,
we can't Iook for her now.
Auntie Em. Auntie Em.
You keep trying the door.
Auntie Em. UncIe Henry.
Look out, mouse.
You won't eat me, cat.
Put 'em up, put 'em up.
Watch it.
There's more where that came from.
You mean that thing is with you?
Where did you come from?
Why then, you must know Dorothy.
WeII, I'II be.
I'm Tuffy, the Munchkin Mouse.
And I'd Iike to weIcome you
to Munchkin Land.
I'm afraid Dorothy's Ieft hours ago.
The house you and Dorothy came in...
...Ianded on the Wicked Witch
of the East and crushed her.
Dorothy had freed us
from the Witch...
...and then GIinda,
the Good Witch of the North...
...gave Dorothy the ruby sIippers.
But then, the Wicked Witch
of the West showed up...
...to take
the magicaI ruby sIippers.
And she'II do anything to get them.
So GIinda sent Dorothy...
...to the great and powerfuI
Wizard of Oz in the EmeraId City...
...where she's gonna ask the Wizard
to send her home to Kansas.
So she set off
on the yeIIow brick road.
FoIIow the yeIIow brick road.
FoIIow the yeIIow brick road.
FoIIow the yeIIow brick road.
Stop.
You can't foIIow Dorothy.
It's too dangerous.
So you two promised
you'd protect Dorothy, huh?
Then take me with you.
I know I can heIp.
What do you say?
Don't Iaugh.
I'm very insecure about my size.
Uh-oh. Now which way do we go?
CROW 1 : Ho, ho, ho. Look at those--
That's a strange threesome right there.
CROW 2:
Oh, Iook at them. Yeah, odd.
Yeah, go ahead and do something.
You say something
and I'II say something.
Pardon me,
but that way is very nice.
What are you, nuts?
No one goes that way.
What do you mean?
Lots of peopIe go both ways.
How do you do, Mr. Crows?
I'm Tuffy and these are my friends,
Tom and Jerry.
Did you see a young girI
skip by with a basket and a dog?
Sure did.
-She passed by just a few hours ago.
-Yeah.
She hooked up with the scarecrow and
they went dancing down that road there.
Thanks, feIIers.
We'II catch up to Dorothy
in no time now.
UnIess she went skipping down
that road.
You know, I think she did.
Oh, weII. At Ieast we heIped.
-See you.
-Oh, we sure fooIed them.
It's funny. We had to do it.
TUFFY:
Hmph!
TUFFY: I don't know, feIIers,
this doesn't Iook right.
What do you think we shouId do?
FoIIow the yeIIow brick road?
FoIIow the yeIIow brick road.
FoIIow the yeIIow brick road.
Wicked Witch. Hide.
There's that cursed girI.
When I have her ruby sIippers...
...my power
wiII be the greatest in aII of Oz.
But how to do it?
Oh, oh, oh.
You couId ask her niceIy.
Hey.
You couId trade her
for a bag of magic beans.
Ahh! Sorry. Wrong story.
Now, quiet, both of you.
I'm trying to think.
I said quiet.
Ah! That's how I'II get that girI.
I'II turn these pretty dandeIions
into an avaIanche.
We gotta get that wand.
It's the onIy way to save Dorothy.
Hey! What? Whoa!
-Got it.
-What?
Get that wand.
Jerry, catch.
WICKED WITCH:
Give me that wand, IittIe mouse.
It's mine.
Ha, ha!
Enough of this fooIishness.
Come on, you two,
quit cIowning around.
I'II deaI with you
right after I finish that girI. Ha-ha-ha!
Ha, ha-- What? Again?
What's that? What's that?
SCARECROW: Oh, no.
DOROTHY: It's an avaIanche.
-We're saved.
-UnusuaI weather we're having.
Tom, Jerry, Iook out.
Tom and Jerry, eh?
WeII, you've both earned my wrath.
Ahh! This isn't over.
I'II get you Tom and Jerry,
and that IittIe girI, too.
Good work, guys.
Now, come on,
Iet's catch up to Dorothy.
WICKED WITCH:
Someone aIways heIps that girI.
But I'm stiII great enough
to conquer her.
To the EmeraId City,
as fast as Iighting.
Oh, Tom, Jerry.
How did you two get here?
The twister brought them here
with you.
Name's Tuffy, Miss Dorothy.
And I came aIong
because I want the Wizard...
...to give me some height,
on account of I'm so smaII.
Oh, I see.
WeII, my new friends
want to see the Wizard, too.
That's right. I'm hoping the Wizard
wiII give me some brains.
-I want a heart.
-And I need some courage.
And aII Tom, Jerry, Toto and I want
is to get back home to Kansas.
Then what are we waiting for?
Let's get to the EmeraId City.
Look, EmeraId City is cIoser
and prettier than ever.
TIN MAN: Oh, my.
LION: SimpIy amazing.
SCARECROW:
We're nearIy there.
Come on.
SCARECROW:
I'm feeIing smarter aIready.
TIN MAN:
Come on, Iet's go.
Cabby. Cabby.
Just what you're Iooking for.
Take you anypIace
in the city, we does.
-WiII you take us to see the Wizard?
-The Wizard?
I can't.
WeII, yes, but first I'II have
to take you to a IittIe pIace...
...where you can tidy up a bit,
what?
Oh, thank you so much.
We've been gone such a Iong time.
And we feeI so miser--
What kind of a horse is that?
I've never seen a horse
Iike that before.
No, and never wiII again, I fancy.
There's onIy one of him,
and he's it.
He's the horse of a different coIor
you've heard taIe about.
Come on aIong, foIks.
Look. "Surrender Dorothy."
WeII, at Ieast she's forgotten
about you two.
Oops, my mistake.
She's stiII pretty mad at you.
Dorothy? Who's Dorothy?
-And who's Tom and Jerry?
-The Wizard wiII expIain it. To the Wizard.
Dorothy, we'd better see
the Wizard right away.
Oh, I think you're right.
Jerry, pIease find Tom
and foIIow us.
You can't run away, Tom.
You promised you'd protect Dorothy.
I am Oz, the great and powerfuI.
Who are you?
HaIt. No one can see the great Oz.
But we're with Dorothy.
The-- The Witch's Dorothy?
She's aIready inside
with the Wizard.
Don't worry, now.
I know it sounds bad,
but I assure you...
...the great Oz
is wise and benevoIent and kind.
Of course, sometimes
he does get a IittIe ticked off.
What happened inside, Miss Dorothy?
Are you going home?
WiII Scarecrow get his brain?
WiII I get to be big?
Oh, Tuffy, the Wizard says
he won't do anything for any of us.
Not unIess Dorothy brings him
the Wicked Witch's broomstick.
But to do that,
she'd have to kiII the Witch.
DOROTHY:
Oh, this is terribIe, terribIe.
That's right, Tom.
You give that Wizard
a piece of your mind.
Oh. Tom's a Iot braver than I thought.
Okay, Iet's go get that witch.
"Witches castIe, one miIe.
I'd turn back if I were you."
At Iast, I've got that girI
right where I want her.
And Tom and Jerry, too.
Take your army
to the haunted forest...
...and bring me that girI, her dog,
and especiaIIy that cat and mouse.
Now, fIy. FIy.
WeII, what's happened to you?
They took my Iegs off
and threw them over there.
They took my chest out
and threw it there.
WeII, that's you aII over.
They sure knocked the stuffings
out of you, didn't they?
They took Dorothy
and Toto and Tom and Jerry...
...and we gotta foIIow them.
-What a nice IittIe dog.
-No!
Oh, Toto.
And you, my dear,
what an unexpected pIeasure.
It's so kind of you
to visit me in my IoneIiness.
Now, give me those ruby sIippers
or your dog goes into the river.
No, pIease. Take the sIippers.
What a good IittIe girI.
I knew you'd Iisten to reason.
I shouId have remembered.
Those sIippers wiII never come off
as Iong as you're aIive.
But that's not what's worrying me,
it's how to do it.
These things
must be done deIicateIy...
...or you'II hurt the speII.
-Run, Toto, run.
-Catch him, you fooI.
Do you see that?
It's how Iong you've got to Iive.
And it isn't Iong, my dear.
Wanna pIay baII, Jerry?
Tom, Jerry.
That's the Iast of them.
I'II come back for you
just as soon as those sands run out.
And haIt.
ExceIIent work, new guard.
-Any questions so far?
-Yeah.
What does that "Yo He Ho"
song mean?
I have absoIuteIy no idea.
Let's review what we Iearned today.
"RuIe one: Winkie guards
must keep track of their hours...
...and submit a timecard
at the end of the week."
Something wrong, new guard?
Okay, then.
"RuIe two: Winkie guards
receive one personaI day...
...every 300 years.
RuIe three, and this
is the most important ruIe of aII:
"Guards must keep aII water
away from the Wicked Witch.
It's her one weakness."
Got that?
Sir, I think we have a coupIe
of escaped prisoners.
WeII, how about that?
You're having a busy first day,
new guard.
I saIute you.
It's them.
Oh, dear. Seize them.
I'm afraid this won't Iook good
on your personaI evaIuation.
DROOPY:
You know, I'm just a guard...
...but I take my responsibiIities
very seriousIy.
DROOPY:
It's not a gIamorous job...
...but a good guard
aIways does the very best he can.
If you come aIong quietIy...
...I'II try to get you
an extra ration of grueI.
-Gotcha.
-Arrest them, oId new guard.
You better not
try any of your tricks.
They won't work twice.
DROOPY: Are you sure
you compIeted basic training?
-Tom, Jerry, it's us.
-Boy, are we gIad to see you.
Toto found us and Ied us back here.
Where's Dorothy?
TUFFY:
"Witch." "SIippers." "Ouch."
She's Iocked in the tower
with onIy moments Ieft to Iive.
Auntie Em.
EM:
Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away.
I'm frightened. Come back.
-Come back.
Toto wiII find Dorothy. Come on.
There's more?
You mean that water
is the Witch's one weakness?
I'II take that.
You and Tom find some more water.
I'II go with the others and try
to save Dorothy. Good Iuck, feIIers.
SCARECROW:
This way.
Wait, I have an idea.
Dorothy, are you in there?
I'm here.
Oh, pIease hurry.
The Witch wiII be back
when the hourgIass is empty.
I'II handIe this.
Stand back.
LION:
We haven't much time.
Hi.
SCARECROW:
Oh, Dorothy, we found you.
DOROTHY:
Oh, thank you. Oh.
Come on, there's no time to Iose.
LION:
Oh, run.
We're trapped, don't you know?
I'II handIe this.
Who dares disturb my cookie time?
That's right.
That's what you get
when you mess with a big munchkin.
SCARECROW:
Very impressive. Now run.
What are you guys doing?
We need that water, fast.
Come on.
Whoa!
DOROTHY:
We're safe.
Going so soon?
Why, our IittIe party's
just beginning.
We're trapped.
Trapped Iike mice, rats.
WICKED WITCH:
That's right.
Don't hurt them right away,
Iet them think about it a IittIe first.
Ha!
Seize them.
Seize them. Seize them.
Stop them, you fooIs. Seize them.
Seize them.
Guys.
What?
Stop fooIing around.
Dorothy needs that water.
Hmm. Ah-ha!
There. Water.
This way. Come on.
Oh, my.
That way.
Hyah!
Whoa!
WeII, weII.
Ring around the rosie,
a pocket fuII of spears.
Thought you were pretty foxy,
didn't you?
Ha-ha-ha! FiII it up.
The Iast to go wiII see
the first four go before her.
No.
How about a IittIe fire, Scarecrow?
SCARECROW:
Oh, no.
I'm burning. I'm burning.
Jerry, quick, the water.
SCARECROW:
I'm burning. HeIp me.
I'm burning. HeIp.
WICKED WITCH:
Don't throw that water.
You cursed brat,
Iook what you've done.
I'm meIting, meIting.
What a worId.
Who couId have thought
a good IittIe girI Iike you...
...wouId destroy
my beautifuI wickedness?
Look out. I'm going.
She's dead. You kiIIed her.
I didn't mean to kiII her.
ReaIIy, I didn't.
It's just that he was on fire.
HaiI to Dorothy,
the Wicked Witch is dead.
GUARDS: HaiI, haiI to Dorothy,
the Wicked Witch is dead.
The broomstick.
-May we have it?
-Of course you can.
You've freed us aII
from the Wicked Witch.
Now I can go back
to my oId job as a haberdasher.
HaiI to Dorothy.
ALL:
HaiI, haiI to Dorothy.
The Wicked Witch is dead.
Why have you come back?
PIease, sir.
We've done what you toId us.
We've brought you the broomstick
of the Wicked Witch of the West.
Dorothy meIted her.
WIZARD: You Iiquidated her, eh?
-Shh!
So you see, sir, we'd Iike you
to fuIfiII your promises to us.
WIZARD:
Not so fast. Not so fast.
I'II have to give the matter
a IittIe thought.
Go away and come back tomorrow.
ALL:
What?
But I want to go home now.
WIZARD: Do not arouse the wrath
of the great and powerfuI Oz.
I said come back tomorrow.
DOROTHY: If you were reaIIy great
and powerfuI...
...you'd keep your promises.
WIZARD: Do you presume
to criticize the great Oz?
You ungratefuI creatures.
The great Oz has spoken.
What? Hey.
No. Stop th-- Stop that. Whoa!
Oh, I--
Pay no attention
to that man behind the curtain.
The great Oz has spoken.
-Who are you?
-I?
Oh, I am the great and powerfuI...
...Wizard of Oz.
-You humbug.
-Yeah.
I'm afraid you're right.
I am a humbug.
What about the heart
that you promised Tin Man?
And the courage you promised
CowardIy Lion?
TUFFY: Don't forget
the most important thing.
He promised he'd get Dorothy
back home to Kansas.
ALL:
Yeah.
My diminutive friend, you force me
into a catacIysmic decision.
The onIy way to get Dorothy
back home to Kansas...
...is for me
to take her there myseIf.
Oh, wiII you? CouId you?
I wiII, indeed.
But first, I'II fuIfiII my promises
to each of you.
Tuffy, too? He was going to ask you
to make him big.
Yes, Tuffy, too.
My friends, I, your wizard...
...am about to embark
upon a hazardous journey...
...into the outer stratosphere.
And I hereby decree
that in my absence...
...the Scarecrow shaII ruIe by
virtue of his highIy superior brain.
The sum of the square roots of any two
sides of an isosceIes triangIe...
...is equaI to the square root
of the remaining side.
Oh, joy. Rapture.
Assisted by the Tin Man
by virtue of his heart...
...the Lion,
by virtue of his courage.
Ain't it the truth?
And Tuffy,
by virtue of his enormous height.
I'm huge.
Obey them as you wouId me.
Oh! Oh, Toto.
PIease don't go, I'II be right back.
Oh, but this is a highIy
irreguIar procedure.
This is absoIuteIy unprecedented.
Boys, pIease. We don't want to keep
the Wizard waiting.
Oh! Oh, my. Come back, come back.
Don't go without me,
pIease come back.
I can't come back.
I don't know how it works.
Goodbye, foIks.
WOMAN:
Goodbye, Wizard, goodbye.
Now I'II never get home to Kansas.
MAN:
Goodbye, Wizard.
Stay with us.
We don't want you to go.
Look, here's someone
who can heIp you.
Oh, wiII you send me home?
Can you send me home?
You don't need
to be heIped any Ionger.
You've aIways had the power
to go back to Kansas.
I have?
Now those ruby sIippers
wiII take you home in two seconds.
Tom and Jerry and Toto, too?
Tom and Jerry and Toto, too.
Just tap your heeIs three times...
...and think to yourseIf,
"There's no pIace Iike home."
There's no pIace Iike home.
-There's no pIace Iike home.
DOROTHY: There's no pIace Iike home.
There's no pIace Iike home.
There's no pIace Iike home.
There's no pIace Iike home.
There's no pIace Iike home.
-You just had a bad dream.
-Sure you did.
You remember us, don't you?
And you couIdn't forget
your oId paI Tuffy, couId you?
Or me, the IocaI haberdasher.
WeII, she's aII right now,
thank heaven.
Oh, but I wasn't aII right, Aunt Em.
We were in terribIe danger.
But we kept asking peopIe
to send us home.
And they sent us home.
Doesn't anyone beIieve me?
Anyway, it's aII right,
because I'm home again...
...and this is my room
and I Iove you aII.
And, oh, Auntie Em,
there's no pIace Iike home.
