Greetings, sir.
- Greetings. What is the problem?
Sir, I went to search
for you upstairs.
I heard that you were here.
Where is Vidya?
- She hasn't come, sir.
This means I have to spend
the night with you?
No, sir. I am not so fortunate.
Sir, Vidya took time to record
a song at the radio station.
She has asked you to wait for her.
Alright, go on.
Sir. Today is your birthday.
- Yes. So what?
Congratulations, sir!
It's your big day.
So what? - Sir, it's very
cold outside. I swear!
It's cold. Take this.
Mr. Kumar, you have a telephone
call from Srinagar.
Hello. Who is this?
- Brother, I'm Sheila speaking!
Sheila baby! How are
you, sweetheart?
Brother, I am very angry with you.
Why didn't you call me?
Only the ones who are
far away are called.
You are so close to me.
Why should I call you?
Alright, tell me when
you are coming here.
I will need five to six months,
Sheila. Five or six.
Listen, for assisting
you in business. .
. .I am going to search
a husband for you.
An old man?
- Not an old man. An. .
It's my sister. A husband for you.
When I come, I'll prepare
for your wedding.
You'll see that I will get
you married with grandeur.
Will you come for the wedding?
Ok, brother. Bye-bye!
Mister, did you hear that?
Brother is searching
a husband for me.
He doesn't know that I have
already selected my groom.
I'm sorry. I had a recording
today, so I was delayed.
Come on, your fans
are waiting or you.
Yes, go in. Your fans are waiting.
I have had a habit
of waiting for you.
Ranvir.
- Come in. - I'll meet you later.
Ladies and gentlemen and
people who love me.
Today is the 26th of January.
It's a big day.
It's very important for me.
On this happy day, I'll
sing a new song for you.
I have recorded it today.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Ok, ok!

What are you doing, Vidya?!
Something that I couldn't
do when people were around.
Listen to me..
- Lie down quietly.
You were born today, so you
will get a special gift.
Is that my gift?
So is that all you are giving me?
That's for now. Before
your next birthday. .
. .I am going to give
you a exquisite gift.
Is that gift being manufactured
in a factory right now?
You may assume that.
Your next birthday will
be celebrated. .
. .not just by two but three people.
Is someone accompanying us?
Who will come between us two?
The third person isn't an outsider.
He is your relative. The
symbol of our love.
Our child.
- Child?
I loved you, you loved me.
How did a child come between us?
When two lovers truly
Iove each other. .
. .this is what happens.
You aren't joking, right?
You are serious.
Yes. I am certainly serious!
Tell me, do you want
a boy or a girl.
My mind tells me that
it will be a boy.
You talk rubbish! Absolute nonsense!
A child and kids. .
Our youth is to have fun,
not for turning parents.
Understood? Stop this rubbish.
Are you saying this? You!
This means whatever has happened. .
I am pregnant with your child. .
You have many lovers Vidya.
The gift that they have given you,
you are calling it mine. .
Why? Did the truth hurt you?
Why are you staring at me?
Today is 26th of January.
Go and climb onto to the
Red Fort's tall walls.
Shout out that you are
pregnant with my child.
If you still don't feel satisfied. .
Radio singer, go to the
radio station and. .
. .sing songs that would defame me.
If you still don't feel calmed,
go consult a good doctor.
You wouldn't have to tell them
your child's father's name.
Hi! That was Vidya, right?
The famous singer?
Do you have an affair with her too?
No! Don't think about all
that. I only love you.
Won't you wish me?
- oh !
Happy birthday, Ranvir.
Vidya, when your brother was
dying, I promised him.
I said I would send you from
this house as a bride.
I didn't promise him that
you would be pregnant. .
. .without being wedded and
I would nurture him here.
Brother, if my child would cause. .
. .this house to lose its
dignity and you are. .
. .insulted in society,
I'll leave this house.
Yes! Go away!
I can't take over your ill-fame
and your stain over myself.
Not at all!
- What are you saying?
You say anything you wish.
Listen, Vidya. Your sister-in-law
is still alive.
Till I am here, no one can
remove you from this house.
Go in. I'll take care of everything.
Assume if you would have
a sister or a daughter. .
If something like this
would happen with her. .
. .would you remove her too?
I would not just throw her
out, I would kill her!
I would have buried her
alive! Listen to me!
Is this house, everything will
be done as per my wishes.
Do you understand?
- I can't give Vidya's property. .
. .to a fatherless child.
It appears that all the
servants aren't here!
What are you doing here?
Doctor, this..
- Mr. Kumar, please come in.
Where is Sheila, doctor?
- Please come in.
I think you got news
about my arrival.
I came so suddenly that. .
Doctor, she.. - She consumed
poison and committed suicide.
Suicide?
- Yes.
She loved a boy. She was pregnant.
That boy cheated her and fled.
We found this note near the corpse.
She didn't commit suicide, doctor.
She has suffered punishment
for my sins.
It's for my sins.
Sheila !
Ranvir, true lovers aren't afraid
to give up their lives.
She was truly in love.
My love is true too.
Ranvir, to get something we
have to lose something.
You got everything, still
you have lost it.
I lost everything but have
still got everything!
No. No! I won't let that happen.
I won't let that happen.
Its 25000, Gangu.
- Really?
You wanted to go to Mumbai
and drive a taxi, right?
Yes. - This money will
fulfill your desire.
Really? - You will take this
fool with you as well.
Sir, for this amount, I could
take all the fools in town.
I have been fortunate. It's as
though I have won a lottery.
You are my dearest!
Do something.
- Yes.
Take him and run away quickly.
Sir, what do I do after that?
You may nurture him, throw him at. .
. .a dirty spot or put
it on a railway line.
No sir. I won't commit a murder.
The police here are very clever.
If I am caught, I'll
reveal everything. .
. .before being tortured. Yes!
Alright! Take this fool
and bring him up.
He isn't a fool, sir.
I know his father.
You know him?
- Yes!
Who is he?
- It's useless, sir.
The doctor's certificate
will be proved false.
The police too will
be involved more.
The one who had to go has left, sir.
Vidya has gone too.
The play is over. The curtain
has been lowered.
Now only he is remaining, sir.
Sir, from today he isn't a fool.
He belongs to Gangu.
I love kids a lot. I will
give him enough affection.
I'll beat him so much that
he will be hardened.
Ok, ok! You may leave now.
You are too late. She has died.
I heard that she gave
birth to a dead child.
Kailashrao has gone to cremate her.
His wife has gone to her
parents' place in Mumbai.
Give me any message
that you might have.
I'll tell my employer.
Be quiet now. Shut up!
I only have liquor with me.
I don't have milk.
I'll feed you if I get some milk.
I swear by God, I'll feed you.
Sister. Sister!
Give him a little milk.
Alright.
''The one who has brought you in
this world will bring you up.''
''He will bring you up.''
''The one who has brought you in
this world will bring you up.''
''Everywhere, he will save
us from injustice.''
''For his devotees.. ''
''He is never separated
from his devotees.''
''The one who has no one
has God's company.''
''He has God, friends.''
''He has God, friends.''
Bless you, postman.
Keep bringing money for me and
I'll keep drinking liquor.
Here.
- Salutations, sir. - Have fun.
Kailashnath, I praise you.
Father, I'm hungry. Give me bread.
Get lost. You always
keep asking for food.
I don't have enough for drinks.
How will I buy food?
Get lost now!
Go and get some food by begging.
Heera, you are better
than my father.
You have brought bread for me.
''When man's injustice
crosses a limit. ''
''When it crosses the limit.''
''When man's injustice
crosses a limit. ''
''He comes to us in some other form.''
''In innumerable forms. .''

has met us, friends.''
''The one who doesn't have anyone. .''
''The one who has no one
has God's company.''
''He has God, friends.''
Munni, tell me this. How
many years was Ram exiled?
Well.. for two years.
What? How many years did I tell you?
Four years.
Come here. Come.
How did you find out that Ram
was exiled for 14 years?
When you teach her, I listen
to you by hiding here.
Oh! - Forgive me. I won't
listen to you again.
No! Do listen to me.
Why do you do this work?
- For food.
Why? Don't you have any relative?
I do. A dog, my father and me.
Our family is restricted to three.
What is your name?
- Heera.
I wasn't named by my father.
My dog's name is Heera.
So I named myself as him.
Professor, may I tell you something?
Yes.
- Heera knows many languages.
Really? Child, from where did
you learn these languages?
I work for varied people.
They are Bengali,
Gujarati or Madrasi.
They abuse me in their language.
I understand them. I learnt
it in that way.
Alright, child. Read a little
when you get time.
I do want to learn but I don't
have money to buy a book.
I'll give you a book,
Heera. Take this.
Take it. I'll tell my grandma
and get another book.
Keep it, Heera. I'll
get her another.
Thank you. Thanks a lot.
This is your salary for the month.
I swear! Madam, I have
told you many times.
Don't give him money.
You'll spoil him.
What are you hiding?
Are you stealing?
- I didn't steal!
I gave him the book.
Bring the book here.
- I won't give it to you. - Come!
Get a strong Ahmedabad tea!
Sir!
- Greetings. - Sit here.
Do you want a Rasgulla
?
Get a Samosa.
- Samosa ?
Get a Samosa for the Bengali man.
What do you want?
A special. Quickly.
- A special! Quickly.
Sir, didn't you get your yoghurt?
- No, it hasn't come.
What's going on? Give
him his yoghurt.
He's getting it. He's getting it.
- A famous song.
''You don't have any,,work
in my territory.
''You don't have any,,work
in my territory.
Have you come here for
work or for dancing?
Is the person singing, your mother?
I don't know that, sir.
Whenever this song comes on air,
something happens to me.
Something happens to you!
These plates are lying here.
Who will wash them?
Pick them up!
Look, sir. I am alone now.
Earlier I had my dog, Heera.
I would give him the plates.
He would lick and clean them.
Now he is dead.
- Dead?
Your dog used to clean the plates?
What are you saying?
- Sir, don't hurt me.
Otherwise I'll pick all these
plates and hit you with them.
What rubbish!
- Leave it.
I don't want your job. I
have seen.. - Get lost.
Come here. Write your name.
Your father's name.
Will I work or my father?
Why do you want my father's name?
You will do the work
but it is required.
Father's name is required.
Write it.
- Tell me.
Gangu Ganpat.
Did you write that?
Why are you talking so arrogantly?
I am not arrogant, it's my style.
Really? If you want
to work here be. .
. .a little soft in your
style. Understand?
This is my cool style. If
I behave rudely with you. .
. .you would start shaking.
Understand?
Alright. Come on, sign here.
Sit here. The foreman will tell
you what is to be done.
Heera, wait for five minutes.
Do you have cotton in your ears?
Didn't you hear the company's
bell just rang?
I am a foreman. You
have to listen to me.
You may be a foreman, a
five-man or a watchman.
Once the company's bell rings,
I don't know any man.
Understand?
May God cause you to be ruined!
Brother Gaffur. Whom
are you abusing?
Heera, what do I say?
I asked this man 2000 rupees
for my daughter's wedding.
As an advance. He refused to pay me.
Brother Gaffur, you don't
know how to ask.
How to ask?
Son, when I came to this company,
I was as tall as you.
Working for 30 years, I have
shrunk to this height.
If you work for 30 years, you
will be shorter than me.
You teach me about ways?
Brother Gaffur, my style
is different. Look.
If you want clarified
butter from a tin. .
. .you have to bend you
fingers a little.
If you want to get money
from such a rich man. .
. .you would have to
be a little bent.
Son, I am a poor man.
How can I cheat him?
The same old hollow dialogue!
That's the fault in labourers.
We call ourselves as poor. We
believe that we are helpless.
Then we move around.
Rich people look at
this and exploit us.
Brother Gaffur, wait here.
I'll show you how to
get money from him.
No! Son, I don't like fighting.
I won't fight, brother Gaffur.
If our work can be done through
a talk, why fight? Look.. there. .
Tell me clearly! What
do you want to say?!
I'm telling you, sir.
One inspector and four
constables came here.
They saw the truck and stopped it.
They peeped into the truck
and saw illegal goods.
I escaped from there.
The inspector said. .
. .that he confiscates this
truck and the goods inside.
You don't pay the tax and get your. .
. .goods out from the exit gate.
Sir, you were fortunate.
I was sitting there.
Otherwise you wouldn't be sitting
here today but in jail.
You mean, the police
took away our truck?
Yes! Have I been telling you
a movie's story till now?
When did this take place?
Sir, when the sun sets and
before it rises, its night.
I don't have a watch
to tell you the time.
This incident has taken place, sir.
Still, I have flattered and
requested to the inspector.
Sir, I am your employee. Why would
I have you sent to the jail?
What happened then?
- What then?
He doesn't agree with
a few requests.
I kept flattering him, he agreed
and we sealed the deal.
Then he said, 5000.
He wants 5000 otherwise your
company will be doomed.
Sir, he will send his
constables here.
Give them the money
and avoid trouble.
Come here. There he is.
Did you see that? He is the
inspector's constable.
Go and give him the money.
What did you say your name was?
Heera.
- Yes, Heera.
Yes, sir.
- Take 5000 and get it done.
Sir, why do you bring
me into all this?
I haven't been arrested yet.
My name will enter the police diary.
That would be a problem, sir.
It will be alright. If
there is some problem. .
. .I am here for you. Take this.
Sir, I like you a lot. Hence,
I'm doing all this.
Otherwise if it were someone else,
I wouldn't even spit. .
Sorry sir. I spat a little.
Greetings!
May God keep you safe. 1, 2, 3..
Until you don't pay the earlier
debt, you won't get money.
Forget about a debt! My
Heera has come. My son!
My dearest boy!
- What is it, father?
How did you change suddenly?
Do you have a little money?
I have to repay a debt.
Are you thirsty?
You are speaking sweetly
because you want liquor.
From today, you won't have liquor.
You don't know the value of liquor.
You idiot! You have never drunk!
Give me a little money. I'll
die if I don't get liquor.
Drinking liquor everyday would
cause you slow death.
Look, father.
From my childhood till this day,
you drank from my earnings.
From today, you won't get. .
. .anything for liquor, understand?
Pay me quietly. Otherwise
I'll beat you up!
You'll hit me.
- A lot!
Look father. You spent your
entire life as a drunkard.
You may have forgotten that
Heera was smaller. .
. .compared to you earlier but
is now taller than you are.
You have hit me and made me strong.
Now I'll hit you once
and flatten you!
Understand?
- Go away! Are you scaring me?
I brought you up all these years.
Now that I am old, are you
showing me your strength?
You idiot! After all you
are someone else's child.
If you were my son, you
wouldn't say this to me.
Other's child?
- That's right!
If you were my son, would
you not give me liquor?
No, you are lying.
You are my father.
You want to take money
from me for drinks.
That is why you are lying.
Tell me that you are lying.
I swear! I don't want your money.
I thought you would
grow to support me.
You have become my enemy, you idiot!
Who are my parents, then?
You are from the gutter!
These people eat food and throw
Ieftovers in the gutter.
You are their leftover.
No! No!
Which rich man's leftover
am I? Tell me.
Who gave birth to me and left
me to live in dire straits.
Tell me.
- I won't tell you.
Tell me. Tell me!
I swear by God! I won't tell you!
Tell me or I'll kill you!
Tell me! Tell me!
I won't tell you, you
fool! I never will.
You didn't give me liquor.
I won't tell you about your father.
I'll die but I will never tell you!
Oh Lord! What are you doing?
Where is that paper on which my. .
. .father's name has been written?
Why do you want it? For what reason?
Don't ask me. Just get that book.
I'll give it. I'll give.
Take this.
Here.
- Pen.
Pen !
You cut your father's name?
Not just his name. Assume
that I have killed him.
My father is dead!
I don't have a father!
I don't have anyone!
I am alone. I am without anyone.
I am an orphan! An orphan!
''If He so wishes. .''
''If he wishes to, he tests angels.''
''He creates us, destroys us
and then creates us again.''
''A man breaks down. .''
Stop it! Stop singing!
I have been hearing this
from my childhood. .
. .that there is a God.
Where is your God?
This is a lie! Everything
that has been. .
. .written in your book is a lie.
The truth is before you!
Some people in this world use
us like counters in a game.
This is the truth.
- No, son. No!
The one, who is the creator,
knows it.
If he has hurt you today,
tomorrow he'll. .
. .heal you in such a way that
you won't be hurt ever again.
If you don't believe in him
today, you will someday.
You certainly will!
Oh God! Have mercy on
this child of yours.
Have mercy!
Heera.. are you upset
about something?.
I had been hurt a long
time ago, friend.
Now my heart's fire is more
heated than a fire.
Chuttan, why are you crying?
This poor guy's father
died yesterday.
He's drinking since the morning.
Yesterday your father died
and you are still crying.
I have just killed my father.
Am I crying?
They don't care about the
people who are living.
They cry for the ones who have died.
Until when will you cry?
Your father has died today.
Tomorrow your uncle will die.
Then it will be your grandparents.
Will you keep crying for everyone?
I'll tell you something.
They are all fake relations,
understand?
They fulfill their relations for
a while then they leave us.
Break it. Break these relations!
Live as an orphan the
way I am living.
You son of a coffin-stealer!
You're crying for your
father's death.
You have spoilt my mood.
Why did you stop? Dance!
It's because I have come, sir.
When I come to a place,
all its doors are shut.
Who is he?
- He asks about me!
I'll tell you, sir.
I'll tell you, sir.
- What are you doing? What?
Firstly, you are broke.
When a rich man. .
Why?
- Today, I am not broke, aunt.
Look, here. I have brought notes.
Oh! Did you win a lottery?
I didn't win a lottery, aunt.
Today is a big day in my life.
I had a father who died today.
So I am very happy.
Today, I'll dance and
make others dance too.
He says he'll dance and sing!
Yes! I'll sing and dance!
I want to give sorrow
to my father's soul.
You will do the same.
The day your father dies,
you will do the same.
The only difference will
be that you will first. .
. .fake crying before the public.
Then you'll collect
your father's money.
You'll come here secretly.
You will disown your father's
soul. Am I right?
It looks as though you are
going to be killed too.
I was close to death many times.
Whenever it came, it
went back defeated.
I have left it to the
graveyard many times.
Heera, what are you doing?
Use your presence of mind.
Move back! I'll take care of him.
Tell me, will you leave or not?
Friend, I am like the tail of a dog.
Even if it is held straight
for 12 years. .
Anything would happen but
I won't be straightened.
You can't straighten me!
Isn't that so?
- Look. .
If I use this, you're dead.
Your relatives will weep..
your parents. .
I don't care, I have no one.
No one after me or before me.
I don't have anyone
who would cry for me.
Hollow people like you
could die by this gun.
I think that its bullet
is like a peppermint.
Look at this.
''In some way. .''
''Somehow or the other. .''
''In some way. .''
''Somehow or the other. .''
''I will spend my life.''
''How will you do it, dear friend?''
''How will you do it?''
''I don't have anyone after me.''
''None at all.''
''I don't have anyone after me.''
''None at all.''
''No one to cry after I die.''
- ''Neither a man nor a woman.''
''How will you do it, dear friend?''
''You are the young one
of a human as I am.''
''You are a prayer that
has been heard.''
''I am an unwanted favour.''
''You are the young one
of a human as I am.''
''You are a prayer that
has been heard.''
''I am an unwanted favour.''
''The world takes me
to be an orphan.''
''It is a world that
has been formed. .
. .by cruel people such as you.''
''Your abusive language. .''
''Appears to be a blessing to me.''
''Your abusive language. .''
''Appears to be a blessing to me.''
''If I give a blessing it
appears to be an abuse.''
''How will you do it, dear friend?''
''How will you do it?''
''It is unlikely that there'll ever
be sweat on your forehead.''
''That will be a highly improbable.''
''Your sweat is more valuable
than our blood.''
''Our blood is deemed
to be worthless.''
''My blood is similar to water.''
''It won't make a difference
whether I live or die.''
''My blood is similar to water.''
''It won't make a difference
whether I live or die.''
''I know about all the blows
that time may give.''
''How will you do it, dear friend?''
''How will you do it?''
''In some way. .''
''Somehow or the other. .''

Wow! You were fantastic! Well
done, mister.. - Heera.
Yes, Mr. Heera. You
are a real jewel.
Why are you here in this town?
This place doesn't suit you.
Sir, this world doesn't
suit me either.
I thought about leaving it but. .
. .I have to find some people.
Mr. Heera, my mind tells me
you are sure to succeed.
Sir, my mind tells me that
someday you will be dead.
Alright, I'm leaving.
We'll meet again.
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings. Come on.
Aunt, I sang a song. Something. .
Sir, what do we do about him?
He is alone. We can
make him do anything.
Pay him some money and get
him to me immediately.
Darling, why are you giving
me beer and spoiling me?
Greetings, sister-in-law.
Is she your sister-in-law?
Brother, your wife is
like my sister-in-law.
No, Heera. She isn't my wife.
You mean without a license..
- Yes.
Ram.
- Yes.
Heera, what will you drink?
Nothing, sir. Tell me,
what do you want?
What work can you do?
- Any work, sir.
Anything other than what
you were doing right now.
If I get money, I can use
my hands or a knife.
I can even bash up a few people.
Very good, very good. Will you
accompany me to Kashmir?
Why just Kashmir? I am ready
to go anywhere with you.
Heera, I have a vacant
position of a manager.
You may have a position of
a manager or a damager.
It's alright with me, sir, only. .
Yes, you will get that too!
Heera, there is one thing.
You will have to change
your way of speaking.
Don't worry about my language, sir.
I look at a person
and speak accordingly.
There is no language in India
which I can't speak easily.
I'll give you an example.
Greetings, sir.
If you don't mind. .
. .I would like to present
some poems to you.
Enough, enough!
- Sir, languages from. .
. .the entire India have
still to be used.
Dear, my child.
Can't you shut your mouth and. .
That's enough, Heera! I understand.
You really are a man
of importance for me.
Heera, you will have to change
your attire as well.
Sir, these days people may leave
their parents for money.
It won't be difficult
to change my attire.
I'll transform to such
an extent that you'll. .
. .find it difficult to recognise me.
One last thing.
I need a return ticket.
- Return ticket?
Yes. This is because if I
don't like your business. .
. .I want to return from there.
Heera, I like that. You'll
get a return ticket too.
Here's some money, do
something about your look.
Bless you, my dear!
'You look amazing! '
'Clothes can change man
to a great extent.
A short while ago,
I was called Heera.
'Now I really look like a jewel#
Brother, may I tell you something?
Mahinder has completely changed you.
You have been given a new look.
Do you get me?
- Shut up, you fool!
Mahinder may have changed me.
You'll see that I will
help him someday.
Patil !
- Yes.
Pack the clothes.
- I have done that.
What should I do about this?
What is to be done about
this? Throw it away.
This will be with me.
- What will we do that?
This is my self-respect.
Man should never forget who he is.
Your clothes are all fake.
This is a real cloth as
it shows my poverty.
It is like skin from my body.
It is my shroud. A black shroud.
Do you get me?
Give me something, sir.
Please give me. .
Have you been fooled by my clothes?
I am not a rich man. I belong
to the same stature as you.
Wait, let me see.
Hold this.
I don't have spare change.
Give that.
Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!
Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!
Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh! -Come here.
Whom are they chanting for?
-Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!
He is a rich man living here.
-Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!
Every year he gives lakhs of
rupees to the poor as alms.
What are you doing here? Go there.
- Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!
Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!
Hail Kunwar Ranvir Singh!
Friends, I am not worthy of praise.
An orphan and its likes.
Trouble for the society.
I hate such words.
By behaving well with such people. .
. .by giving them food, clothing
and shelter to live. .
. .people think that they
have done their duty.
No. They don't just need
food and clothing.
They are hungry for
Iove and affection.
Love them. Move ahead
and embrace them.
Stop!
If you are so compassionate,
then embrace me too!
I too will have a father like you.
Who are you?
- An orphan! A real orphan!
Leave him. - Where
did he come from?
Come here, son. Come here
and say what you want to.
Come, child. Speak here.
What should I say, sir?
All I want to say is that in
my childhood, I read a book.
At nights, a dacoit would
steal from the people and. .
. .during the day he would return
their stuff back to them.
People would praise him
and touch his feet.
I couldn't understand whether
he was a thief or a holy man.
I will say another thing.
The municipality that creates
a town keeps a. .
. .garbage dump everywhere
in the city.
So that the city is clean.
Similarly, these rich people,
for throwing their garbage. .
. .create an orphanage or an ashram.
I didn't mean to say
that for you, sir.
I will say one more thing!
The Creator should
have made a meter. .
. .on everyone's forehead.
. .so that he would have his
father's name on his forehead.
The world would know
which rich man. .
. .is this orphan's father.
Now tell me.
Old age homes and orphanages
that have been made from. .
. .donations from rich people
should imprison which people?
These innocent folk
or those rich people.
They have given birth to such
orphans and left them!
That's all, sir. I only
wanted to say that.
Forgive me if I said
something wrong.
I am an orphan. I said whatever
came to my mind.
Now, I'm leaving.
Greetings.
- Greetings.
Do you have something to
eat? I'm very hungry.
Yes, sir. Certainly.
- Excuse me, sir.
Hello! Yes, I'm speaking. Yes.
A packet of dog biscuits.
Will you have it here
or take it home?
What did you say?
- No.
Here.
- Take this and keep the change.
Your father has ample
money to be wasted.
Did you say something to me?
No. I didn't speak to you.
What are you doing, sir?
They're dog biscuits!
That's alright, brother.
I am more connected to
dogs than to humans.
Here's the money and
keep the change.
That's strange.
- I forgot my biscuits.
Strange man!
Today, for the first time
in twenty years someone. .
. .said such harsh words which
made all the events. .
. .of my past come before
me, one by one.
It was as though someone was
reading a book of my story.
Who said all this? Who was that man?
He was a young man. I was so
Iost in what he was saying..
. .that I didn't even ask
what his name was.
You are lost in the
words of the world.
My son would keep shouting
and I would keep crying. .
You just don't care about it.
You don't even look at us.
May I come in?
You? - It appears I have
got a wrong address.
I had come to meet Mr. Mahinder.
No! You have come
to the right place.
This is where Mahinder
stays. Come in.
Child, he is the same young
man about whom I told you.
He is nothing compared to my son.
Kamini, use your presence
of mind before speaking.
Call your brother.
- Yes, father.
How did you come by?
Mahinder called me.
- Mahinder is my son.
Your son?
- Yes. Why?
What happened?
No, I just.. he called me
here for a job. - Oh I see.
He is that. .
That's like Heera! That's good!
Mahinder, for the first
time in your life. .
. .you have done something right.
You have brought a right
man to a right place.
Thank you, father.
Heera, you have come here
on the right day. .
. .and at the right time.
Mahinder, time has never
been nice to me.
Still, I am very punctual.
You appear to have had a deep blow.
In twenty-five years,
I have had less food. .
. .and more of wounds, father.
Wow! What a thing to say!
My son, you have spoken well!
I remember an ode at this point.
No one cried at my wedding.
I am the only one who cried.
Very good, doctor.
- Thank you.
This is my friend, Dr. Goyal.
In my past life, I was a cuckoo.
This time, I have been named
as Goyal by my parents.
Mister, what is your name?
- Heera.
You have a shining personality.
Young man, you are slightly sad.
If you eradicate that, your life
will be full of light. - Harzana.
For Heera, vacate the doctor's
dispensary's upper room.
He will work from tomorrow.
Explain his work to him as well.
Listen, Heera. Meet me sometimes.
I stay close to you. I work for you.
I will keep meeting you.
Do you know about any girl?
Stop the vehicle. Stop it!
- Why?
Don't you see? That cart is stuck.
Why are you going there?
He is a very rotten man.
If you help him today. .
Do you get me?
- I don't care about the future.
The present is more important
for me. Understand?
Please move back.
Come on.
Very good. Very good.
Go ahead!
- Very good. Very good!
Thanks a lot, sir.
If you wouldn't have helped
me, I couldn't have. .
. .reached the market at the
right time to sell my wares.
Do you make clay vessels?
- Yes, sir.
God made us from the earth and for. .
. .feeding ourselves we
make earthen vessels.
Sir, this is my younger
sister Channo.
Greetings.
- My name is Ram Singh.
Yes! Alright! Come along,
sir. It's getting late.
ok.
- His long dialogue will never end.
So sir, we have come to Chandanwadi.
This entire plot is ours.
Deals worth lakhs are done
here, in Chandanwadi.
This is our wood cutting place.
All types of wood is shaped here.
Sir, we have reached.
This is one store and there
are four such places.
From today, all these
places and people. .
. .will work under your command.
Only your word will
be followed here.
This is our new manager! Salute him!
You fools! I'll cut your salary!
Raju! Salute him!
Go, do your work.
He is our employee, sir.
He really is an idiot.
He never works honestly.
Now that you have come, you will
set him right. I know it.
Here comes another fool.
What do we do about him?
He will be dealt with in the
same way as the others.
Come in, sir. Come. This
is our control tower.
You can sit here and keep
a watch on everyone.
Such as what work is
being done by whom.
From today, this is your office.
Whose pictures are these?
Sir, these are our former managers.
They are all dead now.
Do you see him? He was
Sardar  Keher Singh.
He liked roaming about.
He went out for a stroll
one day and was killed.
Look at him. He was
a strict manager.
One day, he left for a round.
When he left, he was fine but when. .
. .he returned he was dead.
Do you get me?
Look at him. He was a good man.
He would never feel bad
about anything I said.
One day he felt offended
about something that. .
. .the labourers said. His picture
came into the frame.
Why is this frame empty?
Sir, last time, two frames
were made by mistake.
Now you have come.. understand?
Come along, I'll show you
how to work here. - Come.
Work, planning and punishment.
Do you see this?
If a person does a minute
mistake, he is to. .
. .be beaten with a
small blow, a whip.
If a person does a big
mistake, he is to. .
. .be beaten with a big blow, a rod.
If you get a man who
is worse than that..
. .a sword has been kept.
Sir, even after that if no
one comes under control. .
Follow me then.
I'll show you now. This
is our last way.
Use them freely, understand?
From today, you will
keep this. Here.
The one who spat outside.
- Mukadam?
Yes.
- Ok.
Send him upstairs.
- In a moment.
Mukadam!
- What is it?
Mukadam, you have been called
by the new manager.
Upstairs.
It looks as though he is doomed.
I'll have to get his photograph too.
He had just arrived and
he is going to die.
The poor guy will be killed.
I wanted to promote Mukadam
and make him a manager.
I wanted to add his photo
to the empty frame.
When he said that he had three
children, I stopped.
I thought that those kids
would turn orphans like me.
Harzana.
- Yes, sir.
Keep this key. I don't need this.
Put this into his pocket and
when he is conscious. .
. .explain to him that my way
of working is different.
Understand? Salute him! Everyone.
Where is Mr. Mahinder?
He must be worshipping
a Goddess at this time.
My darling! These soft hands
are like flowers and velvet.
They are not to be used
to clean this car.
They are for caressing
my heart. Come on.
My dearest, I don't like blue
soap on your fair cheeks.
Today, I'll finish cleaning you up.
Accountant, may I say something?
Your car is 100 years old.
You never sat inside.
You have removed the engine
and kept it under your bed.
Now why are you being cruel to her?
I have told you numerous
times to keep a servant.
Mr. Mahinder Bahadur.
I am not so fortunate
to employ servants.
I just have a girl. She might
prove to be lucky to me.
She will.
- Yes.
Accountant, may I go in?
Certainly, young man. Go in.
This is like your house.
Thank you.
My chess board! You ruined my game!
Accountant, look before
you set up a game.
Otherwise it will be ruined.
- Who are you?
Accountant, he is our
new manager, Heera.
Ok, forgive me. My play
was stopped so I. .
Treat him well.
- ok.
Mahinder! Mahinder!
You? Why did you get him here?
Sir, I haven't brought him. .
No, Mahinder! I came here
by my own accord.
I saw all your places. I thought
about seeing this place too.
If I have to get to
you in a emergency. .
Greetings, sister-in-law.
You really are weird!
Whoever you see with me. .
. .you address her as sister-in-law!
What? Did he call someone
else sister-in-law too?
No, darling. He has
a habit of joking.
Listen, I liked you calling
me as sister-in-law.
Always call me sister-in-law
from now on.
Alright, he will call
you sister-in-law.
Now go in. I have some work. Go.
You will..
- Mr. Mahinder!
I have seen your jungle,
house and office.
Now explain to me what
work is to be done?
Come here. We own
Iand on Kali Tekdi.
Some slum dwellers have
usurped that land.
You just have to move
them from there.
You mean, the people
who live there. .
. .are to be rendered homeless.
I want to make a brilliant
five-star hotel there.
Ok! The poor folk will get a
place to stay in that hotel?
Heera, are you insane?
Will slum dwellers reside
in a five-star hotel?
No. I thought that as
the government says. .
Eradicate poverty, break down slums.
Make homes and let the poor stay.
Perhaps you thought about the same.
No! I don't have such plans.
You mean you don't want to
eradicate poverty but the poor.
I'll remove them.
- Listen.
There is a Hanuman temple.
Oh! Along with humans, you
want to throw out Gods too.
I'll do it.
- That's it!
Sir!
Sir, should I tell you something?
A miracle has taken place.
Heera has cleared the slum!
Very good! Get out of this room!
ok.
- Did you see my likes, darling?
Something that couldn't
be done all my life. .
.. Heera did it for me.
I think this man is a real jewel.
Hail Mahinder!
Hail Mahinder! Hail Mahinder!
Did you hear that?
- People are praising you. - Me?
Hail Mahinder!
Hail Mahinder!
Hail Mahinder!
Hail Mahinder!
Young man, you are being
praised outside my house.
What deed have you done?
I was just.. I have been
in since morning.
Friends, this is the place.
This is Mahinder.
Touch his feet! For Mahinder. .
Hail Mahinder!
Hail Mahinder! -Shut up!
What is this
rubbish, Heera?
Rubbish? There has been
no mistake, sir.
These people have come to thank you.
Thank me for what?
Sir, you had their huts broken down.
Then you gave them place to stay
in the accountant's house.
In my house?
- Yes.
You were ousted by Mahinder yet. .
. .you want to invade my house?
Accountant, just two and
a half people stay here.
You, your wife and your daughter..
who is dim-witted.
There is one chess board
and a few counters.
There will be loneliness here.
If these people stay here, there. .
. .would be some noise and activity.
Isn't that so? Come, brothers!
Four people are to get
in one room! Come on!
No one is to go in!
Heera, don't mess with
me. Get them out!
Accountant, why do you worry?
r
When I had to clear Kali Tekdi
I used a bulldozer.
If I want to clear this house,
I'll use a bulldozer again.
Heera, what is this nonsense!
- Mahinder!
Father.
Mahinder.
- Father, why have you come here?
Who told you to ruin
this settlement?
You made these poor people homeless.
Father, I..
- Sir.
Sir, you are scolding
him without a reason.
You should embrace him today.
Mahinder has done such
a big favour to you.
You can't estimate that.
He has cleared these people's
old huts and. .
. .promised to make a better
colony for them.
Until that time, he has permitted. .
Isn't that right, Mahinder?
Mahinder?
- Yes, father.
This is the second right
thing that you have done.
Come, brothers! Come on in.
Four people in a room.
Not more than four.
Very good. Stay here.
- Young man.
This man that you have
brought from the city. .
. .if kept here, will harass
you all your life.
Do you understand what harassment is?
Greetings.
- Greetings.
Go on. Heera?
Sir, I was passing by and felt
like seeing you. So I came.
Come in.
You have wasted al your bank
balance in donations.
Will you keep something
for us or not?
Why? Everything is alright.
What do we need?
'Alright?' My son, Mahinder,
will have his birthday soon.
I want to buy a new
Mercedes for him.
I want six lakh rupees.
Kamini, your son Mahinder isn't. .
. .so young that he
still needs gifts.
He is old enough to take the
business into his control.
To give you from his earnings.
Whenever I ask you for something. .
. .or for my son Mahinder,
you argue with me.
I am not arguing. I am telling
you to explain to your son.
The aim of life isn't
just to move about in. .
. .air-conditioned cars.
It's something else.
What's your aim in life?
To spend lakhs and crores of
rupees to earn false praises?
Lady, sir is right.
- Shut up!
You're an outsider. Don't dare
to intervene! Understand?
Beggars and orphans!
Will they help you?
In old age, you will shiver
and be stuck to your bed.
No orphan such as him
will come to help you.
Then you'll remember your son.
I don't know where these people
come from for alms.
Alright, sir. I'm leaving.
Heera.
- Yes, sir?
Heera. .
. .why are you crying for me?
My son has never cried for me.
I am so unfortunate!
I wish you would have been my son!
May I come in?
Come, doctor.
- What is it? Your eyes are wet.
Doctor, I saw Heera
crying and wept too.
It isn't bad to weep, Mr. Kumar.
They are good for the eyes
and bad for the heart.
I remember that when I was born. .
. .my father wept miserably.
Kunwar, at that time I
decided not to marry.
If I were married today,
I would cry for my son. .
. .just as you are crying.
Uncle, when you start speaking
you don't stop.
Tell me, when did father
had to cry due to me?
I wasn't saying that.
I said that you should take
care of your father.
Now look, medicines have been
required since two days.
Go to town and get them.
You mean, I stay in this
house just because. .
. .I am to get medicines from town?
Father, aren't there any retainers
who can help you?
My friends are waiting for me.
I'm going for hunting.
Go. Doctor, is this medicine
very necessary to be taken?
Yes.
- Give me that, doctor.
Father, till I am here
in this house. .
. .you don't have to worry
about such work.
I'll get the medicines.
- The city is far away.
How far, sir? It is in India, right?
Pardon me, madam. You
can't take the dog in.
Mind your own business.
He isn't an ordinary dog.
Madam. Madam! Excuse me, madam.
You are not allowed to bring
a dog inside this hotel.
I don't go anywhere without my dog.
That's good! That
is a very warm dog.
I mean, hot dog.
Look, madam. Our customers
may object to it.
We can't trust a dog. He
may dirty this place.
You don't know this dog.
He is my dog!
He's always with me. Understand?
Look, madam. We don't care what
your dog does with you.
We can't allow your dog to
come inside this hotel.
What if he causes us a loss?
If he causes you a loss,
I'll pay the money.
It's very spicy!
The pepper. These mountain
peppers are too hot!
Madam, I have told you.
- I have told you too.
My dog will eat with me.
Add his bill to mine. Thank you.
Madam, we don't let a dog in.
There is no question of feeding him.
Stupid.
- What did you say?
I didn't say that to you but my dog.
His name is stupid.
However, he is cleverer
than you are.
Listen to me, Stupid.
Wait here for me.
Don't move and don't be naughty.
Are you married?
- Yes. I have 1 1 kids.
Yes. You may have 11 kids
but are you married?
Sir, why are you joking?
Why don't you have a separate
table for dogs?
I wasn't speaking to you.
I spoke to the manager.
Manager.
- Yes.
Why don't you have a separate
table for dogs?
Yes! Have a special table made.
Write upon it that
it's a dog's table.
Very funny! Why don't you
mind your own business?
She's speaking to you.
Puppy!
Hello puppy! Stupid little puppy!
Come on, doggy.
Yes! Do you know what this is?
Waiter! Throw out the dog!
Get in!
Waiter!
You idiot!
Very good, go up!
Well done!
Come on, run.
Waiter! - Yes, sir.
Come to me, Stupid.
Your dog has ruined the whole hotel.
He harassed all the customers.
How much damage did he do?
- Damage!
Take this.
Madam, it's not about the money.
The customers have been
caused an inconvenience.
The hotel will be defamed.
- Take this.
Why don't you understand?
If this isn't enough, call at
my home and order a cheque, ok?
''Just because you got
a little money.''
''You think that you are God.''
''Only God would know what
will happen to you now.''
''Why are you so arrogant?''
''Why are you arrogant
about your money?''
''Why are you arrogant
about your money?''
''This money.. ''
''This money will take you
away from your loved ones.''
''It will take you away.''
''Why are you arrogant
about your money?''
''Why are you so arrogant?''
''In big houses filled
with gold and silver.''
''There is more pain
and lesser calm.''
''There is more pain
and lesser calm.''
''Rich people of this age. .''
''They have snatched love
and broken hearts. ''
''They have snatched love
and broken hearts. ''
''I don't say that m:ney
isn't important.
''However, money isn't everything. ''
''Man is man and money is money.''
''My heart is like yours too.''
''Money is good and bad as well.''
''It's poisonous an,,d
intoxicating too.
''It's poisonous an,,d
intoxicating too.
''This intoxication.. ''
''This intoxication does cheat us. ''
''This money.. ''
''This money will take you
away from your loved ones.''
''It will take you away.''
''Why are you arrogant
about your money?''
''Why are you so arrogant?''
''Where are you going?''
''How many things can
you buy with money?''
''Can you buy a heart or life?''
''Love isn't sold in a market.''
''A beloved isn't sold at a shop.''
''Flowers are sold. Its
fragrance is not.''
''Our bodies may be sold.
Our mind can't be sold.''
''Rest and dreams can't be sold.''
''Restless desires of the
heart can't be sold. ''
''How many things can
you buy with money?''
''Can you buy a heart or life?''
''How much can you pay for the wind?''
''How can you value this beauty?''
''You may have money for the land.''
''How can you value the skies?''
''How much can you pay for the wind?''
''How can you value this beauty?''
''You may have money for the land.''
''How can you value the skies?''
''If you have a little money,
this world is lovely.''
''This world is lovely.''
''If you have more than required,
then believe me.''
''Believe me. ''
''In your mind. .''
''It creates problems in a mind.''
''This money.. ''
''This money will take you
away from your loved ones.''
''It will take you away.''
''Why are you arrogant
about your money?''
''Why are you so arrogant?''
Medicines. Here's the spare.
Give that to father.
- No!
Before money takes me away
from my loved ones. .
. .I should separate
myself from money.
What are you saying, brother?
- The matter is such.
Today, as I was moving about,
I saw a girl like thing.
A girl like thing?
- Yes.
She appeared to be a girl.
She was always ready to attack.
She was too short-tempered.
She had her father's money.
You may assume her to be
a moving treasure chest.
Chest? Whom are you talking about?
The same girl like thing.
However, I showed such
presence of mind. .
. .that you will see it's result.
When will I see it?
- Your next life.
Next life?
- Yes.
After today, that girl
will pray to God.
'O God, don't let me be born
in a rich man's house#
'O God, don't let me be born in a.#
You? How did you come here?
No, Mohini, Madhu. A girl like thing.
Yes, Madhu. I am that
girl like thing.
I am filled with arrogance
due to my father's money.
You're strange. You
are so young and. .
Shut up! Remember this.
When someone is a 'somebody'. .
. .he assumes himself to be valuable.
A homeless beggar won't
be proud of his father.
What?
- Yes.
If your father has money,
show it off!
Mohini, please!
Madhu, you don't know what
this man did today.
This incident today will bring
your family, mother, father. .
Don't speak against my father.
You spoke against my father first!
My father has respect and
a position in society.
He has educated me.
He has made me capable
of living in society.
What has your father taught you?
To tease and insult girls?
Only people who don't have
self-respect would do that.
Enough! Don't say
a word beyond that.
What will you do? Will you
kill me? What can you do?
Stop it, Mohini.
- How can I let it go, Madhu?
I am not scared of such
disgraceful orphans!
Please! For my sake. Let's go.
An orphan.
Madhu, the creator has
put life into stones.
This is nothing, dear. Come
inside and take a look.
You would feel as though
statues will. .
. .come off the walls and talk to us.
Come along. Come, Mohini.
Go on. I'm coming.
- ok.
You?
- Yes, it's me.
Why have you come here?
I have come here to reply to
what you said at the house.
If you had a reply, you would have
given it to me at that place.
I could have.
Here, I thought you are trying
to enjoy these statues.
So, I thought I'd introduce
you to living people.
I don't want to listen
to your rubbish.
You will listen, princess!
You spoke before Madhu
and I heard it.
Now I will speak and
you will hear me out.
You called me an orphan.
Do you know what that is?
Madam, an orphan is like
an insect from a gutter.
He can neither live nor die.
People throw him onto the
footpath as their sins.
Even death doesn't accept him.
It leaves him numb for people
like you to hurt him.
You were born inside a house, right?
The protection of your
house saved you from. .
. .the dirt in this world
but think about this.
If you were born near a gutter,
you wouldn't have parents.
You wouldn't have a family.
From your childhood, you would get. .
. .leftovers and abuses
from the people.
When you would grow and
before you turn into. .
. .a woman, you would
have been made a call girl.
Orphans like me would
ask about your cost.
They would play around
with your body.
They would call you immoral
and a call girl!
Shut up!
- Now you feel hurt.
Madam, don't say anything
against anyone. .
. .without knowing everything
about them.
God doesn't know who is responsible
for every crime.
If at this time, in
this dark corner. .
. .I would do something
wrong with you.
The world won't call
me as a criminal.
It will deem that orphan
as a criminal. .
. .whom you will throw away in
secret, just as I was thrown!
Before the animal inside
me hurts you, go away.
Go away!
Heera, send these papers
to the lawyer.
Tell him that I want the copies
immediately. - Yes, sir.
Madhu, what is it?
Why are you crying?
Father, today is a day for
a Rakhi .
Every brother goes
to his sister and. .
. .gets a Rakhi tied. He
blesses his sister.
My brother hasn't come yet
even though it's afternoon.
Madhu, you act strangely.
You search for cold water
in a scorching desert.
Child, people who value
a Rakhi deem it. .
. .to be more valuable than
any amount of money.
For people like Mahinder, a Rakhi. .
. .isn't a bond, it's a thread.
It isn't Rakhi, just ashes.
Heera, explain it to Madhu.
Don't cry, Madhu.
Why are you crying?
I'll get Mahinder. I know
all his hangouts.
I am a servant of this house.
I will never let you cry.
Are you telling the truth?
- Yes, I am.
I swear.
- Whom do you swear by?
Whom should I swear by?
I don't have anyone.
No relatives whom I can swear by.
What are you doing, Madhu?
I'm tying a Rakhi to my brother.
No, Madhu. I am not worth this.
You have made me a brother.
I am a man who has been
thrown away and rejected.
I have never felt any relation
throughout my life.
I am dirty, Madhu. Just
to be kicked around.
No! You are my brother.
If someone kicks you,
I'll cut his legs!
I am your sister, right?
Son, till yesterday you
had no one in this world.
Today, you have a sister
and a father.
Sir, the fires of life had
burned me and wounded me.
Your love has healed my wounds and. .
. .caused me to weep, sir.
I can't determine whether
this is a dream or reality.
If it is true, what was that
which I saw till today?
If it is a dream, may God cause. .
. .my eyes never to be opened, sir.
Not 'sir#  Call him
as father, brother.
Father!
- Madhu !
Where are you? Tie a
Rakhi quickly. Hurry!
Mahinder.
- Yes, father.
These are the bonds of love.
They don't wait.
The one, who was destined
to have it, got it.
Father, I don't like all this.
Heera, I called you here for work
not for making relations.
Don't step into the house
unless you are called.
Understand?
Greetings, lawyer.
- You?
I'm Heera. I have been
sent by Mr. Kumar.
Ok! - He has asked for
these papers urgently.
Well, I may need a hour
or so to prepare them.
That's alright.
Go roam around till then.
Where can I go, sir? Your
Iand is so small that. .
. .in five minutes I
can go around thrice.
I'll sit here.
- Alright then.
Ms. Saxena! Read these papers.
Brother, I apologize. I think
I have met you before.
Are you fond of green pepper?
You are upset?
Oh my! It's my enemy's house!
Oh my! -Listen!
- Yes.
Where are you going?
- Well.. I'm leaving.
What happened? You just
said you would sit.
Now you say you want
to leave. What is it?
I don't have any problem
in sitting here.
The problem is that
I had a wrong number.
Wrong number?
- Yes. I'm leaving.
Listen to me. Tell me
what the matter is.
What is it? What can it be?
Actually, she spoke roughly.
I spoke straight away.
That is why, we had a problem.
That is why I am leaving.
- Listen!
She was wrong, you were right.
Speak properly, why are you
beating around the bush?
This is it. That's it, lawyer.
I have just found out that
the world is round.
That is why I am leaving.
- Where to?
To move around.
Your papers are getting ready.
Take them along.
Sir, send them anytime.
Otherwise, I'll see a good
chance and come again.
For the time being, I'm leaving.
You?
- You !
I have explained everything to him.
That is why, I'm leaving.
How can you just go away?
How should I leave then?
I was searching for you.
Come with me.
Heera, you are doomed.
What happened? Come.
Your words shook my entire life.
A big incident, perhaps
the biggest of my life. .
. .was reminded to me by your words.
Which incident?
I was a child. A boy used to
work at my grandma's house.
He would wash our utensils.
He knew many languages.
Hindi, English, Urdu, Marathi,
Gujarati, Punjabi. .
He would speak them very easily.
His father was a drunkard.
His father would drink
and beat him up.
Yes. He would even take
away his salary.
One day, my professor asked me.
How many years was Ram exiled for?
You couldn't answer. So
the boy said, 14 years.
Yes. Then, I gave
him a book to read.
His father took it away.
He hit him so much that he never
returned to your house.
Yes! How do you know all this?
Do you want to meet that boy?
Do you know him?
- He has been with me since birth.
Where is here? Take me to him.
He's very poor. He stays in a hut.
I don't care. Wherever he may
be, please take me to him.
Come along.
This place is to dark.
I can't see anything.
I told you that he is very poor.
Poor people only have darkness
for themselves.
Come along.
Where is he?
- I'll show you.
Is that him?
This is the same book
but where is he?
You recognised the
book that you gave.
You couldn't recognise the person.
Take it. I'll tell grandma
and order another book.
You!
- Yes.

Where are you going, darling?
- To hell! What do you care?
I care just about you.
I will go where you go.
That day you were talking
about a relation.
I was in a hurry. Let's have
our relation made today.
You idiot, leave me!
Brother!
Why are you troubling
your brother, beloved?
I am talking about a relation..
- Brother!
Save me! Brother!
Save me! Brother!
Save me!
Leave me! Leave me!
Channo!
- Brother!
Mahinder!
- Your lousy brother!
I'll see you someday.
Brother! Don't let this fool escape!
Mahinder! I won't spare you today.
You fool!
Throw out this dog!
Go there.
You idiot! Go back otherwise. .
. .you'll be killed mercilessly.
You slaves of a ruffian!
Bring him to me.
Otherwise, I will kill you all.
Get him!
You thugs! If you dare
to move ahead. .
. .I'll set this wood-house to fire!
I'll burn down this wood-house!
Bring Mahinder out!
Bring Mahinder out
or I will set fire!
Ram Singh! No, Ram Singh!
Bring Mahinder out here.
I say, bring him out!
- No, Ram Singh!
Don't do that. What have these
poor people done to you?
r
If this wood-house is burned
their kids will perish!
Ram Singh! If you want Mahinder,
I'll get him.
Don't do this, Ram Singh!
Ram Singh!
- No. - Brother!
Brother!
Why are you crying, silly?
Your brother is still
alive. Sit here.
Brother! Wipe your tears.
Brother!
- Channo, what happened to my hands?
No! Channo!
No. My hands! Where are my hands?!
What happened to my hands?
Where are my hands?!
Return them to me!
What happened to my hands?
No! You took away my hands.

Mohini? How did you come
here at this time?
At least you recognised me.
I thought for Ram Singh
you would forget. .
. .me along with the
rest of the world.
How can I forget you?
Anyone who sees you once
won't forget you.
I see you all the time.
That's enough! Why didn't
you meet me all this time?
The world extends beyond Ram Singh.
It does. It's a beautiful world.
However, now my world will start
from here and end here.
What about me?
We will be there for
each other. Get it?
No. I didn't understand.
I knew you wouldn't. You
will find out. Come.
Where?
- We have to buy some things. .
. .for Ram Singh from town.
Tell me. I'll get it.
Ram Singh's house's responsibility
is mine.
That is my duty. A man
should do his duty.
Come.
Sir! You are with a girl again?
I have been searching for
you since many days!
I didn't find you at the doctor's
house or wood-house.
I find you here at this
rotten man's house.
Understand?
- I have understood.
I think I'll have to
make you understand.
What do you mean?
I mean that if you ever speak
badly about Ram Singh. .
. .again, I'll make your
other eye flap too.
Forget about me. Take
care of yourself.
Should I tell you a secret?
Mahinder is very angry with you.
You haven't come for
work since many days.
He has called you immediately.
Come with me!
Listen to me.
- Yes.
Tell Mahinder that I
have quit his job.
Also tell him that if
he ever looks at. .
.. Ram Singh or his sister again. .
. .I'll make him stand on a
road and burn him to death!
Get lost!
Tell me!
You dishonest man! Where is Heera?
You still have your old fervor.
You idiot, you feel
secured due to Heera.
I asked you where
he is. Where is he?
I won't tell you.
- I will make you tell me.
Tell me!
Get up. Now tell me where Heera is.
I won't tell you.
Tell me! You won't tell me? Tell me!
Now tell me. - Till I remain
alive, I won't speak.
You won't tell me?
- I won't tell you.
Bhima, beat him up.
Brother!
You idiots, leave my brother!
You idiots, leave my brother!
- Leave him!
You coward! If you want
to take revenge. .
. .take it from me. Why
do you attack him?
Bhima, hurt him more.
Leave my brother. I beg of you!
Don't beg for your brother!
Everyone begs before me, you'll. .
. .have to form a relationship.
I'll leave your brother.
Don't beg before that idiot!
If I listen to you, will
you spare my brother.
No, Channo!
- Certainly.
Don't worry about me.
- Promise. I'll leave him.
No! Don't worry about me, Channo.
I'm ready then.
- No! Channo.
Your brother has lost his hands.
Don't humiliate me and
go to him, Channo.
Bhima.
- Channo!
Channo. .
Ram Singh!
Why did you do this, Ram Singh?
Heera.
- How did this happen?
It's good that you came, Heera.
Mahinder has taken away Channo.
Channo?
- Save my sister, Heera.
Go, Heera.
- But Ram Singh. .
Save your sister, Heera.
Don't delay. Go.
Save Channo. Go, Heera. Go on!
Channo.
Where is Channo?
- Which Channo?
Mahinder, where is Channo?
Which Channo are you talking about?
Mahinder, where is Channo?
Where is Channo? Come with me.
Ram Singh! I have brought
your guilty man.
Ram Singh!
Ram Singh.
- Channo.
Channo. Channo!
What happened, doctor?
- Suicide.
Ram Singh! I have become
a lair, brother.
I couldn't fulfill
any of my promises.
Mahinder!
Doctor, you are still here?
You have been called for
at the police station.
Quickly! Come along, come!
Don't worry. Don't be worried.
I'm coming.
Father?
- What is it, son?
Nothing.
- Whom were you talking to?
It was the lawyer.
- Why?
Father, Ram Singh the
potter has been killed.
How? - Our manager Heera
had an affair with. .
.. Ram Singh's sister Channo.
She was pregnant with his child.
When she told Heera to get
married, he refused.
He's lying, father! He's lying!
What is this I hear, son?
You haven't done anything
other than hearing.
You keep sitting here.
You have left this devil to play
around with helpless people.
Speak properly! Who are you
to call my son a devil?
He is not only a devil, mother.
He's worse than a demon.
You don't believe because
he is your son, your own.
Come with me. I'll show
you his reality.
Shut up, discourteous man!
You want to blame your crime
on me and save yourself?
Mahinder!
- Heera.
I'll see what the truth is and
what is false on my own.
Then, I will decide.
Fire! Fire!
Leave me. Leave me!
Heera, don't pretend.
You killed them both and
set their house on fire.
Accountant! You're lying!
You may say that he's lying.
How can you say that the
slum dwellers are lying?
Before them you killed them both. .
. .and set their house on fire!
Shut up, you liar!
- Come, inspector. Come.
Inspector, he's the killer.
He has killed Ram Singh
and his sister.
Then he set fire to
their house. Get him.
You greedy dog! You sell
yourself for money!
I am not the killer. It's him,
your provider. Mahinder!
Arrest him.
- Hold your tongue.
Father, did you see?
I was under control till now,
sir. I really was!
I saw your fake refinement
and tried to be civilized.
I became a better man.
You people who are called
civilized are still rotten!
Shut up, fool!
You are a fool and
so is your father!
What are you staring at inspector?
Arrest him.
Sir, I swear by God.
The day I am released,
I will hurt you. .
..in such a way as
Ram Singh was hurt.
I swear by God!
Due to witnesses borne
by doctor Goyal and. .
.. Ms. Mohini, the court has decided
Mr. Heera is innocent.
The court releases Mr. Heera
and orders the police. .
. .to quickly try to and
arrest the real culprits.
Do you recognise this?
- Yes.
I gave you this return ticket.
If you wouldn't like my business
you could return.
Now you should return.
No, Mahinder. There is no way,
I'm going to return.
I liked the business. I
didn't like a few people.
I don't take much time to
correct wrong people.
I'll snap my fingers and
the person is cleared.
No, this isn't so easy. This
isn't Mumbai. It's my town.
Even a dog acts like a lion
in his territory, Mahinder.
Anyway, I have always seen
only dogs that bark.
Some dogs just bite.
They don't bark.
My name is Heera .
If I am embraced
I become jewellery'.
If I am pulled roughly,
I can cut you down.
That idiot has challenged me.
He will surely come here.
This is the only way to come in.
Kill him and properly
dispose off his body.
I'll make you rich.
Remember that none of
you must be recognised.
The villagers should think
that he has fled.
Understand? Yes!
Don't let father know about this.
He won't know. Don't worry.
Otherwise I'll kill you too.
Alright, hurry up!
I'll blow up his brains.
When you shoot him, take
a small reward from me.
Go on now! Get lost.
O God.
Hail Lord Hanuman!
Hey you!
Look at his face. He
was going to kill me.
Brother, tell me, what
shall I do to you.
Forgive me, brother.
God, they are the people who
sent me with a bulldozer.
They told me to destroy the slum.
Remove the temple. Poor
people stay for free.
God doesn't pay rent
too. Remove him.
Look at me. You hurt
me many times, son.
I never complained.
Remember? That day,
I used a bulldozer.
I didn't let you be harmed.
What are you doing? Put that down.
When two elders speak, you
shouldn't intervene.
Understand?
You have made strange models, Lord.
It's good that their number is few.
If it were more you would
be completely cleared off!
Look at this. Another model.
Harzana! Come here, you idiot.
Yes. - Come here.
- Don't hit me, sir.
You were hitting the others
but I was getting wounded.
If you hit me, my sisters
and mother will die.
Do you have sisters and a mother?
Yes. Two unmarried mothers
and a sister.
No! A mother and two
unmarried sisters.
Still you wink at girls?
Sir, if I don't work
for a bad employer. .
..how will I feed my
sisters and mother?
Look, fool.
- Yes.
I'll spare you only
on one condition.
Order me, sir.
After today, you won't wink.
- I'll stop it.
Wrong deeds..
- Stopped.
Honestly..
- Stopped.
I'll be honest!
Did you get me?
- I did.
Go! Get lost!
Alright, I'm leaving.
- ok.
Greetings.
- Greetings. - Bye.
Greetings, sir.
- Who are you?
Sir, have you forgotten
Gangu Ganpat?
It appears you have forgotten
your old story, sir.
I'll have to narrate
it in its entirety.
Do you remember, sir?
You had a friend's sister
at your home, Vidya.
She had a child.
- Yes! Gangu!
Yes.
- That's you ! - Yes, me.
You remembered me only because
I told you the story.
Alright, do something.
Move sideways.
No, sir. Sit back.
I am your old driver. I have
taken my former position.
No, it's alright. I'll
drive. Sit there.
Come.
- o k.
Get off.
- Is this your house, sir?
First get off the car.
- I'm off, sir.
Shut the door properly.
Yes.. why did you stop
sending money, sir?
Take 500 rupees. Get a ticket
and go to Mumbai.
If I see you again, I'll send
you to jail for so long. .
. .that you'll go in alive
and come out dead.
Remember that my name
is Kailashnath.
I remember that your
name is Kailashnath.
You can't send me to jail, you fool.
You committed a sin and
I should go to jail?
You threaten me because I'm old?
I swear, I'll show you, you fool!
What do you mean?
- Meaning?
You have borne witness against
Mahinder in the court.
So, we will decide this.
Whatever I said in court,
was the truth.
Is speaking the truth a sin?
It's not a sin but it is wrong.
What are you doing?
- Go on.
Show the doctor around the market.
So that the others too may see that.
Kumar Ranvir Singh.
Who are you?
Kailashnath's old driver, Gangu?
Gangu?
- Yes.
Are you Gangu?
- Do you know me?
You are Heera's father, right?
You would squander his earnings. .
. .in liquor during his childhood.
Forget it, madam. You know
that liquor ruins a man.
Heera left me and came here.
Heera says that he has no relative.
No, madam! He has everything.
He should be in a big house.
This lousy Kailashnath!
- Speak carefully.
He is my father.
How was a good girl like
you born at his house?
Alright! You are his daughter,
aren't you?
I'll tell you everything.
Your father is very bad.
He made Heera an orphan.
Madam, I haven't eaten
anything in two days.
I haven't taken a drink either.
Will I get some money?
I'll give you as much as you
want. Tell me everything.
Doctor!
Doctor.
How did all this happen?
- It's nothing, son.
There was a premonition.
A storm came and destroyed
everything.
How did the storm
destroy only your place?
Oh! I understand.
From my childhood, day and night. .
. .I have faced such storms.
They think that they have
the law under control.
No, son. No.
- Don't worry, doctor.
I have been practicing for
this match for twenty-five years.
The only thing different
are these clothes.
Now my clothes and speech
have been changed.
I will have to come back to reality.
What is this son?
Doctor, I have played every match. .
. .of my life wearing this uniform.
There was a short interval
but the match resumes now.
Take this, doctor. This is
my shroud. A black shroud.
If something happens to
me, put it over me.
Now no one will bear witness
against Mahinder.
What is it? You attacked the doctor.
I'll beat you up in
such a way that no. .
. .doctor in this world would
be able to treat you.
Don't fight, please! Please don't!
Mahinder!
You coward! You rule over
your slaves! Come out!
In your village, in your colony,
before your house. .
.. Heera challenges you! Come out!
Why is he abusing you?
Why are you hiding inside?!
- He is a fool, mother.
Father has pampered him
a lot. Otherwise. .
Why do you attack an old
weak doctor, you idiot?
If you've got guts come before me!
I hurt you with just
one blow, you fool!
This man and his father
are looting the world.
The father gives donations,
creates orphanages. .
. .and tries to fool the public.
His son. .
He uses his men and acts
harshly against the poor.
Come out!
I ask you, if someone
abuses your God. .
r
. .if he is dishonoured
will you be quiet?
No!
Today that God is being
abused openly by. .
. .a disgusting man, a betrayer!
You rich people! Why do
you make fun of us poor?
Sometimes you treat me as your son.
Then you make me wear a Rakhi..
and treat me as your brother.
It's all for your selfishness.
Otherwise, this Rakhi
is nothing much.
Even if a steel chain would
exist in it's place. .
. .you would still cut it with
the sword of your dishonesty.
Now no one is coming out.
Have you, father and son got scared?
Heera, speak with caution, or else. .
What will you do? Shoot me?
Yes, I will shoot you, Heera.
Here, shoot me. The world will
find the reality of this house.
They should know that
not only the son. .
Even a generous, religious,
the helper of the poor.
The provider of the helpless,
an image of God. .
.. Kunwar Ranvir Singh knows
to pick up a gun and shoot.
Shoot me.
No! No, father!
Wait, father. What are you doing?
Move back, Mohini! I'll kill him!
Don't do that. He has your blood.
He is your son!
Gangu, the driver has
told me everything.
Come in, father.
Sir! What happened?
Is that all you got?
Are you chickening out? Shoot me!
Rich man! Where are you going?
I swear that if I would
have had the gun now. .
. .I would have killed you already.
Alright, sir. Today,
Heera is leaving.
Remember that I won't spare you!
I'll make you lose your respect!
Kill him. .
Don't let Heera live!
Father, his life has tormented him.
Take him, he is very good.
I was very sad to hear that
he moves around aimlessly.
I can't bring him home.
I can't embrace him; I can't
call him as my son.
Mohini, I beg of you.
Don't ever tell my son
that I am his father.
I am helpless. Due to my
image amongst the people. .
..I can't call my son as my own.
I request you, don't tell my son.
Don't tell my son. Don't
say that I am his father.
There he is! Bash him up!
Which people?
- I don't know.
All I know is that Mahinder
was behind the crowd.
Mahinder.
Wait! I said stop!
You have abused our God.
We won't spare you!
Stop! You have been
provoked by Mahinder.
You have insulted our deity.
Yes, I have abused your God.
I have insulted his evil son too.
Do you want to know his reality?
He's uttering rubbish!
Hit him! Hit the idiot!
Hit him! - Move back! Move back!
Move back! Move back! Don't hit him!
Move! Move back! Move back!
Why did you stop? Why? Hit him!
He is still alive! Kill him!
This is the rule of this world.
Bow before the rich
and hurt the poor.
I ask you, what has he done?
It is only that he spoke
for a poor man like me.
He spoke against the rich
who enjoy themselves. .
. .by exploiting the poor.
What are you staring at?
Pick up a stone and
crush him. Kill him!
Hang him! Shut his voice!
You won't get such a chance again.
Our blood should be used
for our well-being.
Get up, son. This world is
not for us. You don't know.
The ones who say the truth
have always been hurt.
Get up. Come on.
No, Goyal. He won't go with you.
He won't go with anyone else.
He will go with me. With me!
Sir, you?
How are you know, son? You
were restless all night.
Sir, what is it now?
Sometimes you want to kill me.
Sometimes you make an
effort to save me.
Yesterday, you had a
gun in your hands.
Today, there are tears in your eyes.
What is this secret?
What do you want from me, sir? What?
Tell me, sir. What do you want?
Tell me, why did you
want to kill Heera?
Father!
- Answer me, Mahinder.
No!
- Why did you lie to me?
Father! Stop it, father.
I am asking for an answer,
Mahinder. Tell me.
Father.
- Tell me! Why did you lie?
He's hurt. Don't hit him.
Stop it. Are you trying to kill him?
Yes, I am going to kill him.
Today, I can't be patient anymore.
I won't spare him. I'll hurt him.
I will destroy this sinner!
- No! I won't let you do that!
Leave me, Kamini!
You wretched man!
- Father.
No, father. That's enough.
What can be done by killing him?
If you want to kill, destroy
the evil within him.
Remove it from his heart.
Hurting a man won't
change him, father.
Leave him. I apologize
for him. Let him go.
Well, father. The truth is
that I am very unfortunate.
Wherever I have gone, I
have spread destruction.
Whoever I took to be mine became a. .
. .stranger, an enemy or he died.
That is why, for this house
to be safe, I'll leave it.
No, Heera! You won't go!
Mahinder, change the
path of your life.
Thank your stars that you
have got such a father.
If he forgives you, you should
consider yourself lucky.
Come on, apologize to him.
Say it, son. Say sorry.
Unless you apologize
to your father for. .
. .your sins even God
won't forgive you.
Look, it's a good chance.
Touch his feet, apologize.
Say sorry to both of them.
It will be alright.
They are both elder to you.
Come on, hurry. Come on!
Father, forgive me!
Heera.
- Yes, father. - Come upstairs.
Yes, father. - Heera, the tune
that you were whistling. .
Yes, it's something I remember
from my childhood.
Whenever, I feel happy I hum
this tune by Ms. Vidya.
Vidya..
- Wow! Is it about songs?
I thought there would never
be any singing in this house.
Why not?
- Father, I have my birthday today.
There is sadness all over the house.
That is why I am quiet too.
Is it your birthday today?
Enough! You'll see
how your brother. .
. .breaks through the
silence and sadness.
Today you'll see how I celebrate
her birthday today.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday, dear Madhu.
- Happy birthday to you.

Diwan Singh! Call the police!
Why do you want to
trouble the police, sir?
They must be resting at this hour.
Let me go, I'm not hungry.
I just came to see you.
- Okay, okay!
Came to see me!
- I'm going, I'm going.
Get out from here!
Kailash! You'll be ruined.
You'll be ruined very badly.
You won't be able to speak.
You won't be able to breathe!
Fool, you'll die a horrible death!
You?!
Heera! My son, why did you leave me?
This old man was living
a bad life without you.
What are you doing here?
I had come here to search for you.
But I met this idiot Kailash.
I'll ask you later how
you know Kailashnath.
First tell me whose son I am.
I will tell you but I haven't
got liquor since two days.
I feel dizzy.
Will I get a drink?
- Yes.
First tell me who my father is.
I will tell you about
your mother too but. .
My throat is parched. If I have
a drink, it will be wet again.
Then, I will start speaking.
Tell me clearly, who is my father?
He is a great man. You will be
very happy to hear about him.
You'll jump with joy if you see him.
Tell me, who is he?
How can I tell you so quickly?
If you meet your father,
I will be doomed.
I asked you for my father's name.
He's a famous man.
I swear, he's great!
You'll be very happy to see him.
What's the hurry?
Alright, I'll tell you
your mother's name.
She was Vidya. She was very rich.
All her money was
usurped by Kailash.
He is the one who
made you an orphan.
Your father..
- Yes. What is my father's name?
He is a great man. You will be
very happy to hear about him.
Yes but what is his name?
You'll be happy.
- What is my father's name?
He is a great man..
You?
- Yes, it's me, sir. Me!
Sometimes, a man leaves
a small part of his sin.
Destiny makes that small part much. .
. .bigger and brings it before him.
As I am standing before you today.
Look at me, lawyer. I
was small at that time.
I was weak. Helpless and innocent.
You were young. Today, you are old.
You are weak and helpless
and I am young.
Man has to pay for his good
or bad in this world, sir.
The boy whom you disowned as
an orphan and a disgrace.
Today, your daughter
Ioves that orphan.
What? - The same story can
be repeated in your house.
A boy like me can be born
in your house as well.
Would you have him
sent away? No, sir.
You won't do that. This time,
the fate is against you.
You don't believe me, right?
Ask your daughter.
Child, is this true?
- Yes, father. I love Heera.
I hate this wealth and
this fake dignity.
You may assume that your child
died as she was born.
Or that you had her
sent away with Heera.
Something that has been thrown
shouldn't be picked.
This is the rule that you have made.
Come, Heera.
Mohini, go back to your house.
What?
- Yes.
I have taken revenge
from your father.
I brought you before him.
He was helpless.
That's all. I have avenged
him. Go back home.
I didn't hold your hands and
Ieave home to go back.
I left to be with you forever.
No, Mohini. I can't be
accompanied by anyone.
Destiny couldn't be
with me. How can you?
I am one of those who are born. .
. .in this world only
with their body.
Our fate is undecided
and so are our stars.
The world doesn't need me.
I am excess baggage for this world.
No, Heera. You aren't
a derequisition. You. .
You are the son of a father?
Me? The son of a great father.
How do you know this?
I know. I am telling you
this as I am forced to.
I am breaking the promise
that I made to your father.
You are Kunwar Ranvir
Singh's son, Heera.
Ranvir Singh? He is my father?
Does he know that I am his son?
Yes, he knows but. .
But he is helpless!
Yes. He is helpless.
He can't call me as his son.
How can he answer the world?
What will people say?
Kunwar Ranvir Singh.
The one whom the world takes
to be extremely honest.
He was born out of wedlock.
His respect is in danger.
Just like your father,
my father too feels. .
. .his respect to be endangered
because of me.
No, Heera.
- Maybe!
Maybe you know that I am
the son of a rich man. .
. .and that is why you
accompanied me. .
. .and left your father's home.
What? Why did you speak so lowly?
Today, you have lost
respect before me.
I don't just love you, I revere you.
For the first time,
I have seen a man. .
. .who doesn't care
about his respect.
That is what I thought
when I left my house.
However, you have abused me, Heera.
You have abused me!
I thought you would be happy. .
. .to hear that you are his son.
What should I do about
this happiness?
What do I do if I am
the son of a man..
. .who can't call him as his son?
That man, Gangu, was better.
At least he called me his
son when he was drunk.
I could be proud and say
that he is my father.
If it is so, I swear by our
Iove that I will never..
. .even by mistake mention
that you are his son.
I bind you to my word
not to say this.
Forgive me, Mohini.
I have been cheated so
many times in life. .
Now I am confused between our
Ioved ones and outsiders.
Come, I'll take you
to Kumar's house.
What? - I told you, you
would be surprised.
Tell me, do you want
a son or a daughter?
Padma, why are you bringing
a boy and girl in between?
Our youth is to have fun, my dear.
I'm telling you the truth, Mahinder.
I am pregnant with your child.
Padma! The same old rubbish again.
Every girl I speak to says
that she is pregnant.
Are you saying this? I am. .
What? I would come here in the
morning and the evening.
Who came here in the afternoon. .
What is it? Is the truth bitter?
What are you staring at?
If you want to complain against
me, go to a market.
Climb onto a temple.
Shout to the world.
Say that you are pregnant
with my child.
If it's still useless,
I have a way out.
I said, 'listen, Padma is pregnant#
He said it's alright.
'Get an abortion done#
I said, 'what are you saying?'
Abortion is a big sin!
It's a great sin.
'Go and climb onto to the
Red Fort's tall walls#
'Shout out that you are
pregnant with my child#
'If you still don't
feel satisfied. #
'Radio singer, go to the
radio station and. .
. .sing songs that would defame me#
You are still quiet? Kunwar, listen.
You may be quiet but I won't be.
I will get justice for my daughter.
Even if I would have to
reply to your deeds. .
. .I won't hesitate.
I will get justice.
I have come to change my will.
Why? For Mahinder..
- I don't want to give him anything.
Why so?
We feel sad if we
don't have a child.
If we have a child and he
dies, we feel very sad.
r
If we have a worthless son
we can't bear it.
Come here. It will be here.
In this drawer.
Father doesn't let anyone
come to this room.
Vidya! How did this photo come here?
This means Vidya loved Kunwar.
Heera is Kunwar's son.
Mr. Kunwar!
- Wow! This is my son!
This is my friend, the lawyer.
Did you come to steal my will?
This is my will, steal it.
Mr. Kunwar, I am very sorry.
Now you'll be really disgraced
before your daughter.
She is sleeping here
in this very house.
When she finds out about her
father, she will hate you. .
Mr. Kunwar!
- As much as I hate my son.
Forgive me.
- Father.
It will be better if
you kill yourself.
Forgive me, father.
- Go, get lost!
What are you doing?
For a small mistake you are
sending away your son?
I don't want such a son
to stay in my house.
If you pity your son,
Ieave along with him.
Go now!
Heera isn't just your father's heir.
He is also the heir
to all my property.
Your property? How's that?
His mother had kept it all for him.
Mahinder, with you I
too will be bankrupt.
If you delay, remember that you. .
. .would have to beg all your life.
You will be as Heera was earlier.
You employed him but he
won't give you a job.
What should I do?
Heera is your enemy and mine too.
Mahinder, your father insulted
me and threw me out.
We will have to remove them forever.
They will have to be cleared.
This is the only way for you.
My father too?
- Look, Mahinder.
You have to leave all that
and start life afresh.
Take Kunwar and get to..
- My. .
Will you kill Heera?
Kunwar has been taken to Chandanwadi
by some thugs.
His life is in danger. Go there
quickly. I'll get the police.
What happened to Heera?
Mahinder's men are beating him up.
Where?
- In Chandanwadi.
No!
Gangu! What is it? Who is this man?
He wants to kill Heera
and Ranvir Singh.
Your father has sent him.
What? !
- Yes.
Where is Chandanwadi? Chandanwadi!
Chandanwadi? It's behind
that mountain.
It's short-cut is from here.
Go on. I'll take care
of him. Go carefully.
Mahinder.
- Lawyer!
Is everything alright?
- Don't worry.
I have arranged it in
such a way that. .
. .father and son will be coming
to save each other.
Father! Father!
Heera! Heera!
Heera !
Father!
Heera !
Father!
Heera !
- Father!
Father.
Heera, are you alright?
Yes, father. Are you fine?
The lawyer told me that you. .
Something is wrong, father.
You fool!
Father! Father! What have you done?
You hurt yourself for me?
Father.
- Mahinder, what is going on?
This is not blood, son.
This is liquor.
I drank it all my life due to you.
Son, I have given you so much
sorrow that I will go to hell.
I swear, that I will go there
with respect. Right?
Father.
- Mahinder!
What are you staring at? It's
a good chance. Shoot him!
No, Mahinder!
Father! Father!
Don't worry about me, Heera.
Catch that fool.
Bhuka! Heera shouldn't
catch Mahinder!
Don't spare him.
Kunwar, you insulted me and
removed me from your house.
I will kill you today.
Hands up!
Mahinder has made everyone
here against you.
Heera gave me this key.
It is to a drawer.
Many weapons have been placed there.
Move on, coward. Move!
- Wait!
Now tell them to throw
away their weapons.
Say it!
- Discard your weaponry.
Good, now give me your
gun and take handcuffs.
Stop there! Otherwise I'll
put this into your mouth.
Move on, lawyer. Let's
go to a police station.
Now you will have to stay in jail.
Doctor uncle, you did right.
Catch him! Run! Get him.
Come along, brothers. Come!
This is your holy man!
Look at his true form.
Kunwar, it has been many
days since you. .
. .came to ask about my daughter.
I thought you would call
me and say that. .
. .this girl is yours
and the boy is mine.
Just think. You have
a young daughter too.
If this would happen to her,
would you be quiet?
Your silence has forced me.
Kunwar, today there will be justice. .
. .or the matter will be cleared.
He is quiet! Brothers, move on!
I say stop!
Don't force me to be as
I was 25 years ago.
I didn't value humanity then.
- Brothers. .
No!
No, Heera! No!
No, Heera!
No Heera, no!
Mahinder, every man has to suffer. .
. .punishment for his deeds.
If he accepts his crime, his
punishment is reduced.
Come before father and accept
to your crime. - No.
I ask you for justice, accountant.
Selfish people like you have
ruined my son's life.
Tell me, how should I punish
you? Tell me. Speak!
Father! Here, I have
brought Mahinder.
Come on, apologise!
Father, forgive me.
You are not my son. You're not.
You are evil from my past
that I have to suffer.
To atone for my sins, I
feel like killing you.
So that my sin is finished
along with you.
However, I won't do so.
Till today, I have fulfilled
your wants, right and wrong.
Today, I will fulfill
your last wish too.
You want to kill me, right?
Take this gun and shoot me.
Father, I am guilty!
Clear your disgrace!
Shoot me!
- Come. Come, inspector.
Come, quickly.
We caught the lawyer.
He was running.
The other party is in the jeep.
The third is our young master.
Come, Mr. Mahinder.
Father! Stop them, father.
If they take Mahinder,
what will I do?
I will..
- Don't worry, Padma.
I will take care of your child.
I will accept you.
Heera! What are you saying?
Yes, Mohini. You have everything.
You can forget me and
spend your life.
However, I know how
this story will end.
Another orphaned child will be born!
He will feel lost in the world.
He will take his poisonous
life and die. .
. .or he will become like me.
A tree full of thorns.
Let me take her.
- No, Heera.
He won't be a tree with thorns.
He won't be an orphan but
Ranvir Singh's grandson.
Inspector, take him.
Father.
What order do you have
for me, father?
Heera.
If you. .
Oh! I understand, father.
I get it.
I'm leaving, father.
- Where will you go?
I'll go anywhere, father,
but I won't stay here.
You may think that a
servant was with you.
He served you and left.
He left! He left!
Heera! Wait, Heera!
Heera! For God's sake! Stop, Heera!
Don't go, Heera! Don't go.
Wait, Heera! I'm coming with you.
Stop, Heera! I bind you
to my word, Heera!
Stop, Heera!
Heera stop! Heera!
Heera !
Stop Heera! For God's
sake! Stop, Heera!
Don't go, Heera! Don't go.
Stop, Heera! Heera!
Heera !
Look, I am an unfortunate father.
I don't have anyone
to clear my tears.
Stop, Heera!
You are not an orphan, I am!
Stop, my son!
I can't be assured
about my life, son.
Only an elder son gives fire
to his father's pyre.
Don't take away my right.
Don't take away my right, my son.
Come back, son!
- Father.
