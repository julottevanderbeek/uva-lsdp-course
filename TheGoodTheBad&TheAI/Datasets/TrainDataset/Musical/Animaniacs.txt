ALL:

* So just sit back and relax *
* You'll laugh
Till you collapse *
* We're Animaniacs *
BOTH:
* Come join
The Warner brothers *
* And the Warner sister, Dot *
ALL:
* Just for fun we run around
The Warner movie lot *
* They lock us in the tower
Whenever we get caught *
* But we break loose
And then vamoose *
* And now you know the plot *
* We're Animaniacs *
* Dot is cute and Yakko yaks *

Of income tax *

* Totally insane-y *
* Hydroplane-y *
* Animaniacs *
* Those are the facts *
And...we're clear.
Hey, great opening,
you guys.
Thanks, Bill.
We couldn't do it
without ya.
Bill, it's people like you
working behind the scenes
that almost won us an Emmy.
Here, have a bag of money.
Wow.
You guys are the greatest.
Oh, those goody two-shoe
Warners.
I'll get them.
But how, I'm wondering.
Why don't you send your warriors
down there to fight the Warners?
My warriors, of course.
That's quite a plan.
Ah. My warriors.
Do as I say and destroy
the Warners. Goodbye.
So long, Warners.
* And that's what we call
Serendipity *
* I-P-I-T-Y *
Gosh.
That was great.
Thanks.
Here, have a bag of money.
Hey, I liked your song
too.
Okay, sport.
Here's a fat-free yogurt.
Looks like trouble.
Let's goof on 'em.
ALL:
Right.
* Super strong
Warner siblings *
* Hey, hey, super sibs *
ALL:
Right.
REEVA:
Curses.
Argh! My warriors have failed
to destroy the Warners.
What should I do now,
I'm wondering.
Why don't you send
a giant monster down there?
A monster.
Of course.
I'm wondering what kind,
however.
Perhaps this bug
will do.
You can use your powers
to make it become a giant bug.
That's what
I'm thinking anyway.
I agree with your plan.
Let's do as you say.
Look out, Warners.
YAKKO:
Therefore,
if we isolate the variable
for the quantities unknown,
we are left
with a quadratic equation
for which there are only
two real roots:
three, and a negative five.
It's that simple.
ALL:
Ohhh.
Sounds like trouble.
To headquarters.
ALL:
Right.
* Super strong
Warner siblings *
* Hey, hey, super sibs *
ALL:
Right.
What's up, Otto?
Ooh. There's a big bug
on the lot.
Hey, what's wrong
with your mouth?
It's all fuzzy.
Now, listen here.
You must destroy the bug
before it destroys
the Warner Bros. studio.
ALL:
Right.
YAKKO:
Power of the blowfish.
WAKKO:
Power of the anteater.
DOT:
Power of the platypus.
Tower of power.
BOTH:
Right.
* Super strong
Warner siblings *
* Hey, hey, super sibs *
DOT:
Let's get this show
on the road.
ALL:
Right.
There.
ALL:
Here we go.
ALL:
Right.
ALL:
Right.
REEVA:
Curses again.
Ah,
this never works.
Let's finish him off.
Right.
Right.
ALL:
Right.
Good job,
super siblings.
We've saved the lot
from harm.
Look what you've done
to my lot.
Do you know how much
it's gonna cost to rebuild it?
Here.
Have a fat-free yogurt.
Hey, kids.
Playing with giant bugs
isn't cool.
If someone wants you to play
with a giant bug just say
"No, thanks."
That's cool.
ALL:
Right.
* She's a cranky old critter *
* She's bitter
We warn ya *
* She lives in a tree house
In Burbank, California *
* Along with her nephew
He says "spew" *
* He's cheerful
Then his aunt starts to rant *
* She gives him an earful *
* She's grumpy
He's happy *
* It's generation gap-y *
* Take a whirl
With the squirrels *
* Skippy and Slappy *
Ah,
put a sock in it.
* That's my aunt, Slappy *
Hold it.
Stop the music, there.
What's with the sappy music
and the dancing?
I don't do pathos,
and I can't dance.
Don't ask me.
Wait a minute.
You look familiar.
Unappealing, but familiar.
Aunt Slappy,
that's the director,
Charlton Woodchuck.
Baynarts?
What are you doing here,
you old son of a hack?
It's Charlton.
It's written in my contract
that when I was old enough,
I'd get to direct.
Yeah, Skippy
has the same deal.
Love ya, babe,
but we're losing our light.
What's with six minutes
of opening a walnut?
Don't you see? It's a parable
about man against nature.
The nut represents the struggle
to achieve our goals.
There.
My goal is achieved.
Let me put it this way,
Sloppy--
It's Slappy, Baynarts.
That's Charlton.
Either you do this script
or you don't get paid.
Hit it, maestro.
Hey, von Stroheim,
there's no nut
inside this shell.
Yes. Exactly.
It's the emptiness
of our existence.
That's symbolism.
That's metaphor.
Yeah, but that's not comedy.
Now there's a nut inside.
Now that's comedy!
You're adorable,
but that's my line.
Wakko,
what are you doing?
Working on a gookie
for the new season.
You know, something funny,
like my old one.
What's wrong
with your old gookie?
Nothing. I just wanna come up
with something new.
Something fresh.
Okay.
What do you think?
Ahh, it's good,
but it's not really a gookie,
is it?
It's more of a--
A shmookie or something.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
Definitely a shmookie.
Where you going?
Get some other opinions.
Hm.
That's not a gookie.
A gookie's more like:
What you're doing is that:
I'd call that a mookie.
Well, thanks.
Hey, isn't that wild?
Look at that.
Hey, that's crazy stuff.
But wouldn't call it a gookie.
That face you're doing
right there,
that, uh,
reminds me more
of a Charlie Callas
kind of chookie.
You know, like that:
To be honest with you, kid,
I'd stick with the old gookie.
Oh, yeah.
Well,
it's delightfully charming,
but not actually a gookie.
Spencer used to do a face
very similar to that.
As I remember,
he called it
a zap-zip-zap-zippy.
Or some such thing.
He had a way with words,
that Spencer.
It looked a little like:
Wakko's got a new gookie.
Let's see what America thinks.
Detroit, hello.
WOMAN:
Yeah. Really like
the face, Wakko.
But I'd say it's more of a...
A nookie.
You mean, like this?
Exactly.
I gotta agree, Wakko.
Yuma, Arizona, hello.
MAN
Hello, yeah, um...
Okay, Wakko,
I'm a big fan,
but I'd have to say the face
just isn't workin' for me, bro.
Sorry.
Burbank, California.
Hello.
MAN 2:
Yeah, listen.
I already told that kid
to stick to his old gookie.
Isn't that wild?
Heh-heh.
How'd it go?
I don't understand it.
Nobody really liked
my new gookie.
You know, Wakko,
just because something's new,
that doesn't mean it's better.
Everyone likes
your old gookie.
You should be proud of that
and not want to change it
just to come up
with something new.
You really think
people like my old gookie?
Yes sirree, Bob-A-Roonie!
What'd you say that for?
Oh, well, I'm working
on a new catch phrase.
Yes sirree, Bob-A-Roonie!
Well, it's not really
a catch phrase, is it?
Okay.
Well, how about, uh,
"Got any ham?"
Nah.
How 'bout, "I feel so free"?
No.
"Don't laugh. It's paid for"?
Nah.
"My eyes are burning"?
Nope.
"I always wear cowboy boots"?
I don't think so.
"Looks like a pump,
feels like a sneaker"?
Oh, no!
"Slap my fanny"?
Steven won't like
that one.
Don't worry,
we've faded out by now.
YAKKO:
This is the city,
Los Angeles, California.
On a starlit winter night,
when the moon
was shining bright,
back in January of 1994,
at 4:30 in the morning,
and without a single warning,
something strange
began to move the floor.
* A quake, a quake *
* The house begins to shake *
* You're bouncing
Cross the floor *
* And watching
All your dishes break *
* You're sleeping
There's a quake *
* You're instantly awake *
* You're leaping out of bed
And shouting *
Oh, for heaven's sake!
* I ran outside with neighbors *
* Their faces
Filled with shock *
* That's because
I'm standing there *
* In nothing but my socks *
* Oh, a quake, a quake *
* Say it's all a big mistake *
* Just feel the ground
Go up and down *
* Won't someone hit the brake?
A quake, a quake *
* Oh, what a mess they make *
* The bricks, the walls
The chimney falls *
* Destruction in its wake *
* I did not have insurance *
* So I called them
From the scene *
* And suddenly
I'm listening to *
* An answering machine say *
* Too late, too late
You shouldn't oughta wait *
* 'Cause now you're stuck
We wish you luck *
* Here comes a 6.8 *
* Who's fault? Who's fault? *
* The San Andreas' fault *
* 'Cause Mr. Richter
Can't predict *
* Her kicking our asphalt *
* Seismologists all say *
* Tectonic plates
Are in between *
* An encroaching
Crustal mantle *
* Yeah, so what the heck's
That mean? *
* It means a quake, a quake *
DOT & WAKKO:
* Oh, really, yeah, no fake? *
* We kind of had that feeling *
* When the ground
Began to shake *
* California's great
It's such a lovely state *
* And every lawn is sitting
On a continental plate *
* Los Angeles had fires
And a riot, and a flood *
* And then a drought
And a recession *
* And then now
We hear this thud *
* Of a quake, a quake *
ALL:
* How much more can we take? *
* We thought that we had
Seen it all *
* But this one
Takes the cake *
* The dirt *
* The rocks *
* And all those aftershocks *
ALL:
* It's just the planet
Moving granite *
* Several city blocks *
* L.A. town is falling down *
* While the ground
Moves around *
* We won't let it get us down
We're Californians *
* A quake *
* A quake *
* It's time
To pull up stake *
* We're all fed up
We can't deny it *
* Fires quakes
And floods and riot *
ALL:
* We want some place
With peace and quiet *
* So we're moving to Beirut *
ALL:
Go nuts!
