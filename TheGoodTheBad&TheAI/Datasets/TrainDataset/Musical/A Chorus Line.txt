Uh, is Tina Mason

Cassie.
You think he's going to
keep us here much longer?
I'm really sorry,
but Zach said
he'll call you
as soon as he can.
And he told me to
ask you in a nice way
if you'd...
Would you
mind leaving?
Shit.
Taxi!
Cassie!
Taxi!
Oh! Oh!
Honey, you all right?
That was a
hell of a fall.
You ok?
I'm fine.

Taxi.

Thanks a lot.
Me?
Aren't you supposed
to start at the end?
Well, I'd like to
tell you to start
at the end.
You can wait in
the musicians' room.
What would you
like to know?
Oh, come on, Larry,
what am I doing here?
He told me
to leave.
I don't care if
there's a tornado
out there.
Shut up, will you?
Come on. I'm sorry.
You all right?
I'm fine.
You want to
put some ice
on that elbow?
I look like
a drowned rat.
Because of
my sister.
She was a girl.
So, my mom decided
she's the one
to get all the
dancing lessons,
so, every Saturday, my
mother would take her.
And once in a while,
she'd take me along.
I'd sit there
all eager, and
I'm watchin' sis
go pit-a-pat
said, "I can do that
"I can do that"
knew every step
right off the bat
said, "I can do that
"I can do that!"
One morning,
sis won't go to
dance class
I grabbed
her shoes and
tights and all
but my foot's
too small, so
I stuffed
her shoes with
extra socks
ran 7 blocks
in nothin' flat
hell, I can do that
that I can do!
Give a man some room
Yeah!
Meow!
Huh!
Safe! Yeah!
Huh!
Huh! Huh! Huh!
Whoa! Aah!
All right.
Ahh!
All thanks to sis
I can do that
You got any
ice for my ego?
It hurts worse
than my elbow.
What the hell
do you expect?
You know what
Zach's like when
he's workin'.
You keep
interrupting
him again--
hey, what are you
talking to me like
I'm a grownup for?
Just stay put.
And keep that ice
on your elbow.
Larry.
Does Zach
still think I...
Cassie, let's get
one thing straight.
You can stay with me
till you find a place,
but as far as you
and Zach are concerned,
I'm not gettin'
in the middle here.
...The circumstances
of my birth.
It's nothing short
of a miracle.
But actually,
I don't know
how I turned out as
heavenly as I did.
No, no. Moving
right along.
Do you want to know
all the wonderful
and exciting things
that have happened to me,
or do you want
the truth?
Well...
Uh, my mother had a
lot of card parties
and was one
of the foremost
bridge cheaters
in America.
My father
worked for this
big corporation.
They used to send him
out into the field a lot.
To drink.
But they were ok.
I was the strange one.
Real, real strange.
Bizarre.
As I got older,
I got stranger
and stranger.
That's when I
started breaking
into people's houses.
I didn't steal anything.
I'd just rearrange
their furniture.
I went to this very
expensive private school
for the exceptionally stupid.
Jock city.
I was a kid who
was always getting
slammed into lockers.
Not only by the students,
by the teachers, too.
I couldn't catch a ball
if it had Elmer's
glue on it,
and wouldn't my
father have to be
this big ex-football hero.
Well, he was so humiliated,
he didn't know what
to tell his friends,
so he told them
all I had polio.
On father's day, I
used to limp for him.
Oh! And I was
always thinking up
these spectacular ways
how to kill myself.
But then I realized,
to commit suicide
in Buffalo
is redundant.
Exactly what you
don't want, right?
Yes?
What do I want to
be when I grow up?
Young.
That light...
Don't you have
anything softer?
Can I sit
on your lap?
No. Sometimes
I'm aggressive.
My parents?
My mother.
My poor,
dear, sweet,
gray-haired,
darling old mother.
She was raised in
an orphanage...
By nuns.
They wouldn't
let her go out--
Ooh.
Better?
Right.
My mother
was kind of...
Middle-aged
and frumpy.
Whose isn't?
At 14, she was
middle-aged
and frumpy.
No. My father
liked them very
young, tall,
and filled out in
all the right places.
Anyway, uh,
God knows why, they
had this daughter.
Me.
And just to get away
from her frumpy,
middle-aged life,
she used to take me
to every ballet
that came to town.
I think, probably
because it was cheaper
than getting
a baby-sitter.
But that's when I
saw that movie...
You, too?
It changed
my whole life.
I saw that
movie 112 times.
I swear on
the grave of
my mother.
Well, let's
face it.
My family
scene was, uh,
not good.
Daddy always
thought that he
married beneath him
that's what he said,
that's what he said
when he proposed,
he informed my mother
he was probably
her very last chance
and though she was 22
though she was 22
though she was 22
she married him
life with my dad
wasn't ever a picnic
more like a
come-as-you-are
when I was 5, I
remember my mother
dug earrings
out of the car
I knew that they
weren't hers
but it wasn't
something you
wanna discuss
he wasn't warm
well, not to her.
Well, not to us.
But everything
was beautiful
at the ballet
graceful men lift
lovely girls
in white
yes, everything
was beautiful
at the ballet, hey
I was happy
at the ballet
that's when
I started
ballet class.
Up a steep and very
narrow stairway
to the voice
like a metronome
up a steep and very
narrow stairway
it wasn't
paradise
it wasn't
paradise
it wasn't paradise
but it was home
mother always
said I'd be very
attractive
when I grew up,
when I grew up
different, she said,
with a special something
and a very, very personal
flair
and though I was 8 or 9
though I was 8 or 9
though I was 8 or 9
I hated her
now, different is nice
but it sure isn't pretty
pretty is what it's about
I never met anyone
who was different
who couldn't
figure that out
so, beautiful
I'd never live to see
but it was clear
if not to her...
Well, then to me.
That
everyone
is beautiful
at the ballet
every prince
has got to have
his swan
yes, everyone
is beautiful
at the ballet
ah
I was pretty
at the ballet
I was born to save
their marriage,
but when my father came
to pick me and my mother
up from the hospital,
he said, "well,
I thought this
was going to help,
"but I guess not."
A few months
later, he left and
never came back.
Anyway, I had
this incredible
fantasy life.
I used to dance
around the living
room with my arms up,
like this.
And in my fantasy,
there was this
Indian chief.
And he'd say to me,
"Maggie,
"do you want to dance?"
And I'd say,
"daddy,
"I would love to dance."
Yes, everything
was beautiful
at the ballet
raise your arms
and someone's
always there
yes, everything
was beautiful
at the ballet
the ballet
the ballet
yes, everything
was beautiful
at the ballet
hey
I was pretty
I was happy
I would love to
at the ballet
where the hell
is that resume
of that blond
girl in the
This one?
Bebe Benson.
Can we smoke?
Can the adults
please smoke?
No break,
Sheila.
Well, then, can
I discuss that
with my kidneys?
Fine.
Thank you.
Me?
I don't know
where to begin.
Tell him how you
got started dancing.
Oh, um...
Well,
it was when this
man came around
to my home,
selling...
Lessons.
Yeah, um, lessons.
Um, dancing
lessons.
And, well,
ever since
then,
I watched
everything
on television
that had any
dancing on it,
especially...
Oh, God, um,
what do you
call them? Um,
Variety
shows.
Right.
Variety shows.
Specials.
I can't remember
what I was
talking about.
Variety shows.
No. Uh, no.
I wasn't--
I wasn't...
Oh, the
specials.
The specials.
Right.
Um, specials.
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry. Um,
it's just,
I'm really
nervous.
Ah, Zach,
for her,
this is
together.
So, anyway...
Robbie,
they're in a
suitcase over
there, somewhere.
Cass--
Sheila, get
your ass up
on stage.
Ooh.
Why is it
only my ass
that ever gets
invited places?
Uh, the
costumes are
in there. Uh...
Hats should
be in this one.
Listen,
go up to the
prop room on
the 3rd floor.
We've been
using it for
an office.
I think you
better stay out of
sight for a while.
Larry, I know
I'm putting you
on the spot,
but I need a job.
I really do need--
hey, hey, hey.
I'll talk to
Zach, but you
gotta stay put,
will you, for Christ's sake?
No more interruptions, ok?
You promise?
Say, "I promise."
I promise.
Ok.
But I'm straight.
I'm not too bright,
but I'm not too dumb.
And, uh,
I'm not too talented.
But you know
me, Zach.
You show me
what to do,
and I'm gonna do
the exact same way,
week, forever.
Uh, c-can
I go next?
Well, I don't
really have
anything to say,
it's just that--
well, it's this
waiting. It's
killing me.
It was
terrible.
Just like
everybody
else's.
Well, none of
it, really.
But, I mean, who wants
to admit you had a
happy childhood?
Sex?
Oh, sex.
Now--now,
that, that was
really terrible.
Well,
I was 12 years
old and...
Well, I didn't
really know
much about it.
So I went to
the library
and I took out
this medical book
with pictures of
the...The male and
female anatomy in it.
And, well,
I thought that was
pretty interesting.
And, oh, I used
to read that
book a lot.
Well, I--I knew
what I wanted to do--
well, anyway, after
I had my first...
Wet dream,
I went straight
to the medical book
and looked it up.
"Milky discharge."
Oh, my God!
Gonorrhea!
I couldn't even
imagine asking
my dad about it.
I mean, well,
I was in shock.
I mean, golly, I...
Well, I didn't have
anybody to talk to,
so, well, I went
to the priest.
And, well, I told
him I had gonorrhea.
Oh, was he in shock.
"Who have you been
with, my son?"
Nobody.
Uh, nobody.
"Then how can you
have gonorrhea?"
Well, finally I
told him about
the book, and,
well, he set
me straight...
Which is the only
time the church
ever helped me out.
Time to doubt
to break out
it's a mess
it's a mess
sex happens to be
the one subject I
can speak about
with absolutely
no authority
whatsoever.
Too young
to take over
It took me 5
years of...
Too old
to ignore
Finally I got a girl
who was actually
willing to do it.
So there I am,
making out in the back
seat with Sally ketchum.
A little of this,
a little of that.
Very little of that.
Well, after about an
hour of this, she said,
"don't you wanna
do anything else?"
I suddenly
thought to myself,
"no,
"I don't."
I guess.
Yeah.
It was the moment I
realized I was gay.
Hello, 12
hello, 13
hello, love
talk about love.
Man, my first
time was with
this girl, Paulette.
Forget about it. We
did it in a graveyard.
The first time
we made love
it was a great
big deal
I was too scared
to feel
nervous from tryin'
next time we
made love
still we were not
a hit
oh, I thought
if this is it
everyone's lyin'
but then we
did it again
and I forgot to
be scared, I guess
'cause when we
did it again
I closed my eyes
surprise
surprise
surprise
surprise
surprise
surprise
surprise
sweet, icicle hot
smooth as a
lemon pie
sailing across
the sky
into the ocean
we liked it a lot
you can imagine why
we had begun to fly
feelings in motion
and then we
did it again
I'm thinkin', was
it beginner's luck?
or is it wonderful once
in each 3 tries?
Surprise!
surprise
surprise
surprise
surprise
first time
love
again
so I
closed my
eyes
it was a
sweet surprise
icicle hot
huh
smooth as a
lemon pie
huh
surprise, surprise
surprise, surprise
huh
surprise
surprise
I mean it.
How would you like
to stay 12 years
old all your life?
My last show, I
played a 14-year-old,
and I just turned 23.
Caught.
Hey, didn't you go
to the High School
of performing arts?
I thought you
looked familiar.
Do you remember
Mr. karp, the
acting teacher?
Oh, yeah.
"In order to be
a real actor,
"it is not enough
to act like a king.
"You also got
to act like a
throne."
Well, on the first
day of acting class,
Mr. karp puts
us on stage
with our legs
around each other,
one in back
of the other,
and he says,
"we're going to
do improvisations.
"You're on a bobsled.
"It's snowing out.
"And it's cold.
"Ok. Go."
Every day
for a week
we would
try to feel
the motion
feel the motion
down the hill
every day
for a week
we would try to
hear the wind rush
hear the wind rush
feel the chill
so I dug right down to
the bottom of my soul
to see what
I had inside
yes, I dug right down
to the bottom of my soul
and I tried
I tried
and everybody's going,
"whoosh! Whoosh!"
"I feel the snow."
"I feel the cold."
"I feel the air."
And Mr. karp
comes up to me,
and he says,
"ok, morales,
what did you feel?"
And I said,
"nothing
"I'm feeling nothing"
and he said
"nothing could get
a girl transferred"
they all felt something
but I felt nothing
except the feeling
that this bullshit
was absurd
So I said to myself,
"don't worry about it.
"It's only the first week.
"Maybe it's genetic.
"They don't have
bobsleds in San Juan."
2nd week,
more advanced
and we had to
be a table
be a sports car
ice cream cone
Mr. karp, he would
say, "very good
"except morales
"try, morales
"all alone"
so I dug right down to
the bottom of my soul
to see how an
ice cream felt
yes, I dug right down
to the bottom of my soul
and I tried
to melt
and the kids
yelled "nothing"
they called
me "nothing"
and karp allowed it
which really
makes me burn
they were so helpful
they called me
"hopeless"
until I really didn't
know where else to turn
Mr. karp comes up
to me, and he says,
"you know what, morales?
"I think you should
transfer to girls high.
"You'll never
be an actress.
"Never."
Jesus Christ.
Went to church
praying "Santa Maria
send me guidance
"send me guidance
"on my knees"
went to church
praying "Santa Maria,
help me feel it
"help me feel it
"pretty please"
and the voice from down
at the bottom of my soul
came up to the
top of my head
and the voice from down
at the bottom of my soul
here is what it said
this man is nothing!
This course is nothing
if you want something
go find a better class
and when you find one
you'll be an actress
and I assure you
that's what finally
came to pass
6 months later,
I heard that karp
had died
so I dug way down to
the bottom of my soul
and cried
'cause I felt
nothing
Um,
well, to
be honest,
I've been listening to
these people, all day long,
trying to be honest.
I mean, uh, say I pull
a hamstring, you know?
Let's be honest.
Here today,
gone tomorrow.
You know
what I mean?
Like the couple
over here that just
got married, I mean,
every time I
tell my wife I'm
going to audition--
we-- she's got a
right to, you know?
I mean, uh, what
the hell? It's not
a question of--
you know what
I mean? Uh, I'm a
damn good waiter.
I got 2 kids
and a wife,
and a mother on
social security,
I'm trying to keep
from eating cat food,
so my daytime
job is not a
question of--
look, I'm a waiter.
That's what I am.
On applications it
says, "occupation."
Well, I--I
put "dancer."
Do you know how
many waiter jobs
I'm fired off?
Well, o-one time
late is-- sure.
But, uh, auditions,
never, you know?
One of my kids
sometimes-- like
my wife says--
but come on,
on applications?
Tuesday, Wednesday.
Summer, winter.
I mean, Jesus.
Look, uh,
I'm married to the
sweetest little
wife in the world,
but, uh,
I don't know.
Listen, um,
before madam
here makes a big
deal out of it,
Cassie's upstairs
in the prop room,
till the rain stops.
I told her to.
What is she
doing this for?
I don't think she's
been working too much.
What do you mean?
She's broke?
Is that it? Does
she need money?
I have no idea.
I don't know.
Talk to her.
I'll get it.
First of all,
let's get one
thing straight.
I never heard
of
I never saw
I don't give a shit
about
I came to New York
because I wanted
to be a rockette
at radio city.
Because there
was this girl
in my hometown,
Betty Lou hyner,
and she'd actually
gotten out,
and she made
it in New York.
She was a rockette.
One Christmas,
she came home
for a visit,
and they gave
her a parade.
A goddamn parade!
And I had to
stand outside
and twirl a
friggin' Baton in
the pouring rain
for 2 hours.
Unfortunately,
though,
she got knocked up
over Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Anyway, that
was my plan.
To be a
rockette.
But the
problem was
I was so ugly,
you wouldn't
believe it.
I mean, I--I
was homely.
Skinny.
Flat as a
pancake.
But anyway,
there I was.
I got off the bus.
I was wearing my
little white tights,
my little white shoes,
my little white dress.
I looked like
a fuckin' nurse.
I finally got
my audition
at radio city.
You know what the
man said to me?
He said he didn't
like my fan kicks.
I can do terrific
fan kicks.
So I said "screw
you, radio city,
"and the rockettes.
"I'm gonna make
it on Broadway."
But at every
audition,
I would dance
rings around
the other girls,
and I'd wind up
in the alley with
the other rejects.
Until one day,
after an audition,
I swiped my
dance card.
And on a scale
of 1 to 10,
they gave me,
for dance...
For looks...
Well.
Dance, 10,
looks, 3?
and I'm still
on unemployment
dancing for my
own enjoyment
that ain't it, kid,
that ain't it, kid
dance, 10, looks, 3
is like to die
left the theater
and called the doctor
for my appointment to buy
tits and ass
bought myself
a fancy pair
tightened up
the derriere
did the nose with it,
all that goes with it
tits and ass
had the bingo-
bongos done
suddenly I'm
getting national
tours
tits and ass
won't get you jobs
unless
they're yours
didn't cost a
fortune, either
didn't hurt my
sex life, either
flat and sassy
I would get the
strays and losers
beggars really
can't be choosers
that ain't it, kid,
that ain't it, kid
fix the chassis
how do you do?
Life turned into
an endless medley
of, "gee, it
had to be you"
why? Tits and ass
where the cupboard
once was bare
now you knock,
and someone's there
you have got 'em, hey!
Top to bottom, hey!
it's a gas
just a dash
of silicone
shake your new maracas
and you'll find
tits and ass
can change your life
they sure
changed
mine
you're all looking
at my tits now,
aren't you?
I'd settle for
just one of yours.
Ooh...
Well, go out
and buy them.
Have it all done
honey, take my word
grab a cab, come on,
see the wizard
on park and 73rd
for tits
and ass
orchestra
and balcony
what they want
is what you see
keep the best of you,
do the rest of you
pits or class
I have never
seen it fail
debutante or
chorus girl
or wife
tits
and ass
yes, tits
and ass
have changed
my
life
Sir?
Not until pretty late.
I don't know why.
I just didn't.
Nothing much.
We were close.
One died when
I was 14.
I really don't want
to talk about that.
I mean, why do we have
to talk about that?
Can he keep us
standing here
this long?
Zach,
we've been
standing here
for quite a while.
So, maybe we
could take a 5?
Uncle Larry's
heartburn kit.
One totally
indigestible,
cold hot-pastrami.
One lukewarm
celery tonic.
I'm going back
on a 6:30 plane.
Naturally, since
you just got here,
and I just
talked to Zach.
Oh, come on, Larry,
what's the point?
He doesn't think I
came in for a job. He...
Larry, the truth.
When I left, how
did he take it?
You know how I know how
bad he wanted me back?
'Cause he didn't
call me once.
Not once to beg me
"please come back."
As if I would,
of course.
It's not that he can't
be sweet and funny
and even warm, but I--
look, Larry, do me
a favor, will you?
I mean, he is what he
is, and that's that,
so just stop talking
about him, ok?
Cassie, Zach asked me
to give you this.
It's the telephone number
of his business manager,
in case you...
Well, he thought
you might need--
some money?
Cassie, he didn't mean--
money?
If I need some money!
All he meant was--
please.
If you change
your mind about
going back...
Well, my sister
was such a
little brat,
was the reason.
But still, I
guess it was a
little extreme
shaving her head.
Would you like
to hear about
the first time
I saw a dead body?
I guess I
was 6 or 7.
Oh, yes! I
even tried--
where the hell
is Larry?
...My best friend.
Larry, do me a favor,
everybody go downstairs
and learn the lyrics
to the "one" routine.
Ok, let's go.
Kill the rail
and hit the work
lights, please.
Cassie,
I'm trying to work.
Me, too.
That's what I'm
trying to do.
I don't need
a handout.
I need a job.
And goddamn it,
it's my turn to
audition now, like
everybody else!
No. No, you shouldn't
have come.
And if you'd called me,
I could have saved
you the trouble.
This is for chorus.
It's not for you.
But this is the only
place there is for me.
Oh, Zach,
I'm a gypsy.
I never had an
apartment in my life
that wasn't a sublet.
All I know how to do
is to point my
toes and leap.
I
oh, Zach.
I'm a dancer
that's who I am
what I do, ahh
Cassie!
I
I am a dancer
give me the steps
I'll come through
give me somebody
to dance for
give me somebody to show
let me wake up in
the morning to find
I have somewhere
exciting to go
Christ, Cassie,
how can I put
you in the line?
You don't fit. You're
too goddamn good.
You bet I am.
And I'm so good,
I can dance any
way you want me to.
Let me dance for you
let me try
let me dance for you
we made a lot of music
dancing, you and I
We? You talking
about us?
No, Zach,
I'm talking
about a job.
I haven't
worked in
over a year.
Please
give me an answer
give me a place
to begin
I
I am a dancer
I have come home
Let me in
give me somebody
to dance with
give me somebody
to be!
let me wake up
feelin' terribly proud
that the girl
in the mirror
is me
let me dance for you
let me try
let me dance for you
we made a lot of music
dancing, you and I
let me dance for you
let me try
let me dance for you
we made a lot of music
dancing, you and I--
Cassie!
All right.
Go down with the others
and learn the lyrics.
We'll see.
Hello?
Hello?
I just wanted
to ask,
if I can't talk
about myself,
I'm out?
I can't do it.
I wish I could.
I just can't.
Well,
people always used
to say I don't look
puerto rican.
No.
I just wanted to
be somebody new.
So I became
Paul San Marco.
I don't know.
I'm not too proud
of myself, I guess.
My father
loves movies.
When I was a kid,
he'd take us all the
time to 42nd street.
The ones I loved
were the musicals.
Well, he didn't
know that.
It was cheap, and...
Anyway,
because of my eyes,
I wear contacts now.
I'd have to move
down front by myself,
so I could see.
And, well, these
strange men
would come and
sit beside me...
And play with
me, you know?
Look, Paul, if this
is too rough, uh--
no. I mean, I
knew I was gay.
In school, they'd whistle
at me in the halls,
and everything.
But what really
bothered me
was I didn't know
how to be a man.
What, uh, what was
your first job
as a dancer?
At the jewel box
revue. The drag show.
I was 15.
I went to audition,
but they weren't
interested in my dancing.
They said, "show
us your legs,"
and they took me
upstairs to this
filthy rat hole.
And they
shaved my legs
and put a pair of
nylon stockings on me,
and high heels.
There I was,
in show business.
The asshole of show
business, but a job.
What did you tell
your parents?
I was a dancer
in a show.
Not what kind,
of course.
They couldn't
stop bragging.
Go on, Paul.
Then the show was
going to Chicago,
and my parents
wanted to bring
my suitcase
down to the
theater after
the show,
to say
good-bye, and...
I don't know why,
I said, "ok."
Well, we were
doing this
oriental number,
and I was wearing
this slinky
oriental dress
and this enormous
headdress
with gold balls
hanging all over it.
And I was going
down the steps
for the finale,
when I saw
my parents by
the stage door.
They got there
too early.
I freaked out.
I didn't know
what to do.
So I ran past them
as quick as I could,
hoping they wouldn't
recognize me.
But the minute I passed,
I heard my mother say,
"oh, my God."
I died.
After the show,
I took off my makeup
and put on my clothes,
not knowing if they'd
be downstairs or what.
But there they were,
standing in the middle
of all these freaks.
You should've
seen my parents.
They didn't know
where to look.
My mother had the guts
to look me in the eyes.
I could tell
she'd been crying.
"Make sure you
eat good," she said.
But then my
father couldn't
even look at me.
"Take care of
yourself," he said.
And they started out.
But then my father
turned around
and went over
to the producer.
"Take care of my
son," he said.
And that was the
first time he ever
called me that.
Come on.
Zach?
You ok?
Go grab a hat.
Let's go, Larry.
Let's bring them in.
Ok, everybody,
we're back up onstage!
Let's go!
You can, you
can, you can.
one smile...
Take one that fits.
Don't keep him waiting.
All right.
Kill the work lights and,
uh, hit the rail, please.
Is this where
he picks the 8?
Ok, let's review it.
Starting position

remind you--

Pop the chin on 2.
And when does

Hat goes up on 5.

One!
That's who I am.
No, you're not!
You're special!
Zach, we're
all special.
Paul is special.
Bebe, Sheila,
everybody up on that
stage is special.
Goddamn it!
You know what
I'm talking about.
Look at them.
Look at them!
Why did you
leave me?
Why, Zach,
you noticed.
You at least could
have told me about
the job in Hollywood.
And what would
you tell me
if I told you?
"Take it," right?
Well, I didn't
want you to tell
me, "take it."
What are you
talking about?
You took it.
That's one thing,
my taking it.
Your telling
me "take it" is
something else.
Anyway, you're
the one who
left, not me.
Months before
I ever went
to Hollywood.
I left? We were
living together.
Sharing the same
apartment, maybe,
but when did I
ever see you?
Now what are
you giving me?
The neglected-
woman bullshit?
You jealous
of my work?
You acted so proud
of what I was--
oh, Zach, I was
proud. I still am.
And I know that
directing a show
takes 24 hours a day,
which I wanted for
you as much as--
as long as I spent
an equal 24 hours a
day with you, right?
Exactly. That's
all I wanted.
And you're going to
tell me exactly how I
could have done that?
Well, if I knew that,
then I'd be the hit,
and you'd be asking
me for a job.
Cassie.
Jesus.
Don't you know
why I took that
job in Hollywood?
Not for me. For you.
It was the
only way that I
could hold you,
I thought,
was to be a
star, like you.
Make you want me again.
Treat me important.
Ready, Zach?
Who do you
want to pick?
I don't
know yet.
Let's do the tap
combination.
Start matching 'em up.
Ok, everybody,
for the tap
combination,
we're going to
start after the
Girls, downstage,
boys, upstage.
Nice and easy.
And 5, 6, 7, 8.
Kiss today good-bye
the sweetness
and the sorrow
wish me luck
the same
to you
but I can't regret
what I did for love
what I did for love
look, my eyes are dry
the gift was ours
to borrow
it's as if
we always
knew
and I won't regret
what I did for love
what I did for love
gone
love is
never gone
as we
travel on
love's what we'll remember
kiss today good-bye
and point me
toward tomorrow
we did what we had
to do
won't forget
can't regret
what I did
for love
what I did for
love
what I did
for
love
Ok.
We're going to
put you into
groups of 4...
Let me see.
Mike,
Maggie,
Paul,
Connie.
Girls, downstage,
boys, upstage.
Let's go.
Ready?
Connie, smile
bigger if you're
going to fake it.
Tapping's not my
strongest point.
What?
Tapping's not my
strongest point!
I see that.
Be right back.
Ohh!
You all right?
Don't move him!
Don't move--
It's his knee,
the cartilage.
He had it
operated on
last year.
Don't move him.
Don't move him.
Maybe we should
prop something
under his knee.
Get his dance bag.
It's ok, really.
I just twisted it.
Does anyone
have any darvon?
Valium?
I do.
Somebody get
some water.
I'll get it.
It's already swelling.
You're going to be ok,
Paul. You're going
to be just fine.
You think we should
give him that?
I mean, we don't
know what's wrong.
Please. I've had
Since lunch.
It's just a muscle relaxer.
Zach. Rhodes is
at St. Joseph's.
He said bring
him to emergency.
He'll be waiting.
Where's his
dance bag?
Oh, I'll get it.
You got the knee?
Yeah, I got it.
Ok.
Paul, you're going
to be all right.
Rhodes is the
best knee doctor
in the city.
Paul, I got your bag.
Good luck, Paul.
Call me from
the hospital.
Do you ever
think about what
you're going to do
if you stop
dancing?
For me?
Yeah.
Real life, I guess.
Well, what?
Getting married,
having babies?
Go off my diet.
What about you, mark?
You want to
spend your life
dancing in
the chorus?
Well, I'd
just like to
get in one.
You don't remember,
but we were in a
show together,
in a chorus, about
a hundred years ago.
Of course I remember.
You were a
rotten dancer.
Why do you
think I became
a choreographer?
How you been,
Sheila?
God, since then,
I don't know.
Good, terrific,
Ok, so-so.
You know, I actually
found the glass
slipper once,
and it fit.
Then it broke.
I have a daughter.
She's 9.
She loves me a lot,
hates me a lot.
And, uh...
God help her,
she wants to
be a dancer.
What's so wrong
about that?
How can anybody
in their right mind
want to be
anything else?
I remember I
used to stand
outside the
stage door
and watch the
girls come out
and think, "God,
"can anything
like that ever
happen to me?"
But now, I
meet somebody,
and they say,
"wow, you dance
on Broadway?
"You got somewhere.
You're something."
Hell of a day, huh?
Yeah.
A few months ago,
the night before I
was going to audition
for a new show,
I--I had a
kind of breakdown.
I started crying,
and I couldn't stop
for about 2 weeks.
I just now got out
of the hospital,
and my doctor
told me it was too
soon to try again.
But I did.
And now,
even if I lose,
I've won.
Hell of a day.
Larry.
Line 'em up, Zach?
Yeah. Line 'em up.
Ok. Everybody
on the line.
Dick?
That's it.
Thanks a lot.

and you know she's

and you know
from her...
maddening poise,
effortless whirl
she's a special girl
strolling
can't help
all of her qualities
extolling
loaded with charisma is
my jauntily sauntering
ambling shambler
one
she walks into a room
moment in her presence
and you know you must
shuffle along,
join the parade

of making the grade
for the girl

to none

I'm a son of a gun
the
she is one of a

step she takes
one

every move that she makes
one smile, and suddenly
nobody else
will do

and you can
forget the rest
for the girl is 2nd best

the
