Ratanlal Bagula.
Sub-inspector.
You're in our custody today.
We're going to question you..
...until you don't give us answers.
Who was she?
How did you know her?
You don't know that“
...you're a police officer yourself?
Tell
...how it happened?
Who paid you to do this job?
How were you connected to that girl?
How were you connected to that girl?
Sir, this is Satyakam.
Shyam Dada.
JB sir.
How were you connected?
Sir.
Bagula.
I am the head of this investigation.
Arun Roy.
And my study is..
...you'll be rotting behind bars for a long time.
Be sure.
I can help you.
...help me.
Bagula, I know that the..
...person who shook up the law and country is a girl.
Her name isn't Sigdi.
Her real name is Kaanchi.
I can see confirmation in your eyes.
Right?
We will catch her, soon.
Be sure of that.
Soon she will be behind bars.
And maybe...she'll face rigorous punishment.
What difference does it make, sir?
It won't make a difference to her if you hang her.
She will just smile.
She's a b***h.
Forget it, sir.
I want to know everything.
I want to know the real story.
A petite girl like her can't do such a big job.
It's impossible.
What's the truth behind these facts?
How are you related to Kaanchi?
We're friends.
Since we were kids.
We studied in the same village, the same school.
She was junior to me.
Seven years ago I came to Mumbai.
And she grew up there...
in that village.
Koshampa.
A village for retired army soldiers in Uttrakhand.
She was the star of that place.
Kaanchi.
Kaanchi!
How did they get in Kakda Land without permission?
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi!
You played foul.
Get lost.
Why you..
"Kaanchi."
"Kaanchi."
We've to turn this Koshampa valley..
“Into JB Koshampa city in a year.
World class valley.
And anyone who causes obstructions“
...will be responsible for his position and life.
Don't you know who you slapped?
Yes, I know.
He's that scoundrel inspector Bhagwafis son.
You hurled the trophy which the MLA presented you.
You're no princess.
What else did you expect?
I was holding the trophy in my hands..
...so that's what I hurled at him.
You're still arguing with me.
You're a girl still you abuse people.
What do you expect?
Did you want me to bow before that rascal?
Be quiet.
Don't beat her.
Get her married. Her in-laws will do the beating.
Get going-
Nirman Singh, will Kaanchi ever change.
N eve r.
What?
That Deepu complained to mother?
Yes. To mother.
And he even cried before her.
Kaanchi.
Where are you going?
Please spare some change.
Please spare some change.
Hold it!
Hi-five..
Did you complain to my mother?
Yes, I did. So?
Why you..
Now go complain to her again“
“that I slapped you again.
And this is in advance..
...for the next time you complain to her.
- You'll get it tomorrow.
- That's okay.
Hail Goddess!
She slapped my son, now watch“
...how I sc*** her and her family.
Mind your tongue.
Okay, here. See.
You will all have to mind your tongues.
When Kakda family comes to Koshampa..
“And exterminates all of you.
Binda has given Kaanchi an apt name.
'Sigdi' .
Kaanchi's the brave daughter of my brave son.
If you mess with her, she will roar back.
So do you women want to burn everything down?
Your father...
died in the Kashmir war.
He left us few pieces of land.
Now Khajra, Bhagwat will trouble us to sell the lands.
We were born in Koshampa..
“And we'll die here.
Your Binda has gone crazy..
...by doing rounds of the court.
And you..
If you keep picking fights with government officials“
“won't they make our life difficult.
Even if we all join hands..
...we still can't face this storm
Mother, who are you talking to?
Mother, you're singing in the wrong tune.
And the words are wrong too.
It's been 19 years since..
“I've been hearing this wrong lullaby.
The words can be wrong, but the meaning is right.
Can I say something?
If I say sorry will you forgive me?
Sorry, mother.
Don't cry.
She's crying.
Fine, go on cry.
Wretch“
Only one man can set you right.
Your Binda.
Let him set himself right first.
Who does he think he is?
Is he back from the city or not?
No. He never tells me.
One, two, three, four, five..
One, two, three“
Come on, come on.
Faster. Faster.
Yes, sir!
Five, six...
Faster. Faster.
Come on, come on.
Come on
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Go back to training.
Come on.
Z4.
Your hands are amazing.
Kamla, you haven't seen my magic yet.
Come on, I'll show you magic.
- Hey..
- Quiet.
She falls down intentionally.
Don't I know?
So that Binda picks her up and..
...touches her under the pretext of applying balm.
If you feel jealous then don't come to my compound?
Learn if you want to, or else leave.
Fine, I won't come.
Don't try to boss me, wretch.
What did you say?
Scoundrel“
Get going all of you.
No anger.
No anger at all.
Binda has to look after all the students.
- That wretch“
- No abusing.
Girls don't abuse.
- You don't know that ***
- For my sake.
Fine.
He loves you.
I see. ls this love?
He applied ointment on her back..
Quiet!
I am quiet.
He's returned tired and worn out from the city..
“And is already training.
He's also brought gift for you and your mother.
I don't want any gift.
He didn't even say sorry.
Scoundrel“
Get lost.
Papa, why are you wasting time on her?
- Because I like her.
- I see.
Give me one reason.
She's untainted, honest.
And second, she's my martyr friend“
“soldier Surat Singh's daughter.
She still steps out wearing his army belt.
With pride.
Is that the only reason?
Yes .
Papa...you're totally great.
Completely.
Have some shame?
What's shameful in this?
Return the towel.
First I want to know why did you stay so long in the city?
I went to see a girl for myself.
Papa said so.
Did you find one?
Her name's Haseena.
Is she more beautiful than me?
Every other girl's more beautiful than you.
- Lie.
- And one more thing.
I went to see a boy for you.
Your mother asked me to do so.
So did you find one?
You'll be really happy to see him.
Then do one thing.
Come like this to my house.
Hey! Kaanchi.
Kaanchi.
Hey naked, here's your towel.
Cover yourself.
Binda.
Yes, Pa Pa-
Son, are you okay?
Sorry, P3Pa-
I forgot to take the towel.
You forgot to take the towel.
Don't feel shy from me.
Here you go.
Tell me...what's your new plan?
See what I do tomorrow, papa.
I'll take a gorgeous face along for her.
Let me introduce you.
This is Paddu Pahalwan.
Hailing from the village Surajmukhi.
Famous singer, Basya Maharaj is his father.
And harlot Reshma Bai is his mother.
Paddu Pahalwan is their youngest son.
Actually speaking his name is Padam Singh.
I really like the boy.
Paddu.
We won't find a rich boy like him again.
He's nice, sister.
Take him home once.
Can I say something?
I was looking for a successful man like him.
I don't want a fair, handsome looking mouse.
I am ready for the marriage.
Start preparing for the marriage.
Binda, you just lit the furnace.
Go inside and see the consequences of your charade.
She's Kaanchi.
Glass may shatter, but not Kaanchi.
What do I do with this crazy girl?
You teased her, now you convince her.
She couldn't take a small joke.
She troubles me all day long.
Kaanchi.
Scared?
Yes .
What would you have done ifl had died?
Followed you.
Why?
'89' YOUr point?
What?
Should I say it or do it?
Do it.
I almost forgot.
Papa gave me this, it was for you.
I told him to remind me.
I gave the t-shirts, bags and everything else, but“
“but one should give this beautiful bracelet“
...to the beautiful girl first.
Get lost. Rascal.
Next time you do something like this..
...l'll hang you from a rope.
That fatty was right for you.
You should marry..
I'm looking for a fatty for you too.
Find me one.
I'll have real fun with a fatty.
This girl has no fear of death.
When it comes to teach someone a lesson..
...her brain runs faster than a computer.
One.
Two
Three.
Four.
Now keep stretched.
Everyone stand straight.
Come on.
Brother, Kakda's men are here to buy our land.
Good morning, Binda.
Good morning.
Good morning.
You still have an eye.
I do, Binda.
There's 2 million, in this bag.
And Kakda sir has sent it especially for you.
All you need to do is sign.
One sign, chapter close.
You don't get such an opportunity, try to understand.
- Give it.
- Yes.
- Take a look.
- It's heavy.
Chandu, give it to papa.
kaY-
Thank you, Khajura.
Thank you.
Hold on.
Just one sign.
One sign.
Very good.
Very good.
Very good. Very good.
What are you doing?
This is cheating.
What have you done?
The school needed money, Khajura.
Because I need money to defend my case against you.
You don't get it, Binda.
This is cheating.
Your bosses are doing the cheating.
They bought the lands of the soldiers by paying peanuts.
You won't get a sq.ft.
If you play games like this“
“then Kakda sir won't spare you.
Who is Kakda?
Why don't you bring this weakling before me?
If Jhoomar Babu shakes hands with Binda..
...his fingers will crack.
Do you want to see his strength?
I'll see his later.
First let's test yours.
Go, go to the court.
Let's see who is Jhoomar Babu Kakda.
Sorry, sir.
Bakula here.
Wrong timing but right information, sir.
Sir, engineer Pandey turned about to be a ratter.
Yes, sir.
He leaked all the information“
“about the Uttranchal Project to Davar's CA.
For 100 million.
Yes, sir.
What did he say?
What else.
Kill him.
Koshampa Valley project is a scam.
Mr. Jhumar didn't hesitate“
...to seize the lands of old retired soldiers.
Because he's supported by politicians.
Beware of him.
Okay, sir.
Yes, I am Neeraj Pandey.
Jimmy.
It's your brother.
- Yes, brother.
- As your elder brother“
“I've tried telling you many times“
...that every job should be done with a system.
Try to understand.
Small mistakes lead to the destruction of the rich.
I had a word with the Chief Minister of that state.
We'll have to go to Koshampa once.
You will have Koshampa..
“But only through political influence.
Through a system.
- ls he hurt?
- No, no.
I am very sorry.
This is the first time I'm driving in a valley.
Sorry, princess.
You look rich, can't you afford a driver?
No. I like it alone.
Listen.
Can you show me the way to sunset point?
Look, if you help me out...
...it'll be nice.
That's fine.
How do I tell you?
Do one thing.
See this path.
Take this route down.
Up ahead you'll find a dirt road.
Take a right from there.
Next you'll come across a hillock.
Jump on it.
And as soon as cross that“
...you will come across a lake.
After you cross that“
...Narayan Temple is 40 steps ahead.
Look.
You can see it from here.
That's where Sunset Point is.
You'll get there in no time.
Get it?
Interesting.
But I don't understand shortcuts.
You don't get shortcuts?
It's right in the middle.
You'll get there in 2 minutes.
If you could sit in the car..
“And direct me to Sunset point“
...l'll be obliged.
I like painting.
So it's important to see Sunset Point.
So please.
Will you help me?
Papa and uncle are here too.
Koshampa Valley Project belongs to us.
So you're Kakda.
Strange name, right?
Yes, but I am not like my uncle and papa.
I am different.
You see, I am an artist.
Simple nature lover.
Beautiful Koshampa.
Magical painting.
I want to paint it from every angle.
If you show me a beautiful spot like this every day?
Who will do the work?
My father.
You're right.
I'll pay you 1000 Rs. every day.
A reward for your work.
Like..
Like a tourist guide.
I hope I didn't hurt you.
I paint too.
Wow, that's great.
Then we can respect each other.
Come, I'll drop you home.
The children are waiting.
No.
I'll take this route.
kaY-
I'll pay you 1000 Rs every day“
...if you show me a location.
- So did you take it?
- Yes. Look.
Free note.
Kaanchi, people's trouble start with this free note.
But I want this to deposit in the school.
Donation.
How's the SUV?
Better than you.
Because he gave you a note?
He respects me, not like you.
Fine, go around with him.
And then come back to me.
Jealous.
The General Secretary of India's favorite political party.
Creator of many leaders, benefactor of the poor..
...Shyam Dada will say a few words.
Hello.
I didn't come here to give a speech.
I came here to confess some of my crimes.
Everything my secretary said is a lie.
That, "lam great, I am this, I..."
N01 "0, no, no.
The truth is that“
...we've tarnished the image of this country.
We've tarnished our own image.
We've donned new garbs of corruption.
We've played sleazy games for power and position.
The truth is I did nothing“
...that I should've done for the country.
So I want you to let your children join politics.
So that they can lead the progress of the country..
...in the right direction.
Sorry.
I've nothing more to say.
He's playing mind-games.
Hail India.
Hail Koshampa.
JB Kakda, who's going to build Koshampa valley here..
...we'll say a few words to you.
My brother...
...Shyam Dada's weakness is..
...he crosses all limits of modesty.
He just said he did nothing.
I want to ask, if he hasn't done anything“
...then who helped this country progress?
Roads, dams, airport, school, technology“
...who built all this.
All this is the creation of your vision, brother.
Due to your efforts.
He has the habit of taking blame..
...for the dirty jobs of the other politicians.
My brother is great.
My brother is great!
Teach your children to progress this country.
Make money.
Make money in every way.
Greed...
...is nothing bad, it's a good thing.
What are you thinking, Jhoomar?
That you're peeling an orange.
Orange?
These days' politics is like this orange.
Different from the inside“
“and different on the outside.
Here...eat it.
So...what did you learn from me today?
That always tell the people..
“What they want to hear.
Very good.
But, Jhoomar, sometimes you get too loud. Loud.
Brother, I am what I am.
This is how I am.
I am not a hypocrite.
Shushant sir liked her simplicity“
“and Kaanchi liked his humbleness, sir.
We don't know what anyone wrote or taught us.
- Kaanchi.
- Yes.
Straight.
We just know three things.
And 3. Fight for your right.
Where's the India that was better than the rest?
Who'll be the leader of the people?
And who will be the benefactor of India.
We.
All of us.
Myself.
Me alone.
My strength, my honesty.
- Is it true?
- It is.
- Is it true?
- It is.
Is it true?
I like this man.
He's my best friend. Binda.
And me?
We just met.
Good friend.
But doesn't he talk too much.
Exactly.
I tired of explaining him.
He's such a bore, right?
Tell me...can a single man change the entire country.
If it's like this, then so be it.
We've to lessen the distance between the rich and the poor.
Bravo.
I heard that young man likes some local beauty.
Shall we abduct her?
But that's not right, uncle.
Ia-
I mean..
Say it.
You're sc***.
You're in love with her.
What?
How do I explain it?
I like meeting her.
The way she talks.
The way she moves.
She's the best gift of God in Koshampa.
I see, let's do one thing then.
Let's sell Koshampa..
“And bring your 'God's gift' here.
What do you say?
Yes .
I want to make her mine.
So the fever's all time high.
Go ahead, son.
Let the heat off.
When you cool down, you can come to me.
kaY-
Do you know what brother's biggest mistake is?
This boy here.
Lover boy.
Come on.
You know, today I am going to make a painting of you..
...more beautiful than you.
Why?
Am I not beautiful?
You are.
But colorless.
There's lack of color in you.
Yes...
...so you are there...
to fill in the colors.
That's right.
That's why you will have to“
...close your eyes like a divine idol.
Please, come on.
kaY-
Perfect.
You know, I love red color.
And this red color will look beautiful on your lips.
I hope you didn't mind that.
I want to go home.
- I want to complete my painting“
- I want to go home.
'Why didn't you slap him?'
'You were scared, weren't you?'
Subedar was here last evening.
To ask for Kaanchi's hand in marriage for Binda.
And he wants to get them married this month.
When the mango's falling in your lap..
...then what's the hesitation?
That's what I am saying, get them married.
Anyway, they are made for each other.
I don't see anyone else.
Why not ask Binda first?
I'll talk to him.
Early morning?
I couldn't sleep.
Why?
You know...
my family talk about us.
What?
About our marriage.
Will you marry me?
I am not crazy?
Why?
Am I so bad?
Look, Kaanchi.
You're not old enough to get married, neither am I?
You still need to grow up, mentally.
And I've to fight these devils to save Koshampa.
Our families have been seeing us together“
...since we were kids so..
Now...will you marry me or not?
No.
WhY Won't you?
I'll tell everyone that you kissed me.
Get lost, you're crazy.
You're a rascal.
And if you say no now..
...then I'll tell the entire village“
“that you kissed me.
And you also did what's forbidden before marriage.
Now...are you scared.
If you scream at the top of your voice..
“And tell everyone what I did with you..
...still I won't marry you.
Now go, get lost.
Fine, don't do it.
Go and die. And I'll die too.
I'll jump to my death.
Rascal, who do you think you are?
Now go tell your family..
“That I did what's forbidden before marriage.
And...they can put this noose around my neck.
Noose?
Yes .
So why do you talk about dying?
Everyone knows that I was born for you..
“And I will die for you.
"Beloved."
Do I have to say "Love you" in English?
"Stay in my sights."
I see. I was born for you and I will die for you.
Good luck.
"My life-my heart."
Shushant, look.
Hello. Kaanchi.
Come on, Seema.
I don't want to talk to this rascal.
He's not Kakda, they are 'Kekde' .
Sorry my friend.
Kaanchi.
I want to talk to you.
I don't want to talk to you.
Listen to me, Kaanchi.
- Go away.
- Kaanchi.
- Where are you going inside?
- Kaanchi.
Kaanchi.
Sir, this is not your father's house.
This is Kaanchi's house.
Sir.
Leave him.
Leave him, Siddhu.
Go leave.
We're kids of soldiers.
Don't mess with us.
What's his name?
Binda.
Binda.
Kids of the dishonest and rich have one problem.
As soon they grow up..
...they think they're rich and powerful.
Bad.
It's very, very bad..
“That he loved your girlfriend.
But what to do?
I am a father.
I'll have to support him in this battle of love.
You're right, sir.
I am right too.
And if a war's meant to be, then so be it, sir.
Do you know what war means?
What nonsense.
Sir, even I've read history.
And anyway, the girl's issue is a short story.
The real issue is Koshampa.
The government has already passed verdict on Koshampa.
What else?
You're the one who controls the government.
You, you and you.
I am really pleased to meet you.
Every common man of India should be like you..
“That was Gandhiji's dream.
Sir, every resident of this village is exactly like that.
But you can't see it through those glasses.
That's true.
The storm sometimes doesn't see the lamps.
That's a nice dialogue.
We'll use it in some meeting.
Go, son.
Bless you. Go.
Blessings?
Brother thinks he's Sai Baba.
Blessings?
He just gave blessings and let him go.
Shoot those bloody ba****.
In all these years you didn't recognize Dada yet.
He always greets his enemies affectionately.
Because he never says what he thinks“
“and never thinks what he says.
I say what I think.
That's why you're not a politician.
You see Dada is far-sighted.
And we cannot lose Koshampa for one Shashank.
Ia-
Brilliant.
Brilliant.
We came here to do business, rascal..
Not a love-story. Music please.
Burn me if you can.
I am not worried about getting burned
In every aspect, in every way..
...l am waiting to make you mine.
Only to make you mine.
One, two, three, four.
Hit, hit, hit.
One, two, three, four.
Th row.
Th row.
"From head to toe.."
Dada says you're the future of Kakda family.
I see no light on your face.
I can see fused bulb, son.
What's the problem, my dear?
He's deeply in love, sir.
But she's getting married to Binda.
So break it off.
What's the problem?
You can commit a number of crimes, no worries.
We're behind you.
Don't worry!
Such a strong boy, going weak.
Shameful.
Where were you?
- To the city.
- Why?
Sherwani .
Before your marriage?
I am only going to show-off today.
You mean honeymoon before honeymoon.
Pa Pa, YOu ' re great.
I love you.
Show-off.
Give me a new pose.
Honeymoon before honeymoon.
Not allowed.
But Kaanchi always does what isn't allowed.
That's the fun.
No one knows we're here.
Let's runaway, get married.
That will be great fun, isn't it?
Yes, great fun.
Now give me a pose.
Look, I am going down, you stay here.
Stay there.
Wow, sweetheart.
Something filmy.
A bit to the left.
How am I looking?
Honestly...first time you're looking so beautiful.
You want to know a truth too.
For the first time you can see clearly.
- Can I say an old dialogue?
- What?
I love you, Kaanchi.
Always stay like this.
Binda.
Binda.
Binda. Binda.
Binda.
Binda, look at me.
Binda, look at me.
Get up.
Binda, look at me.
Binda.
Binda.
Fight.
Stop.
JB uncle...
...l killed him.
What did you say?
I killed him.

Binda.
Binda!
Can't you hear?
I am calling you.
Binda.
Binda!
Suraj Chauhan has lost his mind.
I just met all the villagers.
No one has the courage“
...to stand against the law and government.
Everyone's scared...
...of Kakda and his government.
Let's go home, dear.
What happened has happened.
I've serving in the police force for 40 years.
I've just two words to tell you.
Forget everything.
We should be used to accepting injustice as destiny.
Powerful people like Kakda run this country, not us.
We're weak.
And that's how we should be.
We're fools, and we should remain fools.
Everyone knows about Binda's murder.
But in Bhagwafis FIR it's been termed as an accident.
What can you do?
And what can we do?
Forget it.
Forget it.
I've written that his death was an accident.
And this record is proof.
Don't stare at me.
If you have the courage, then fight with the Kakda family.
What are you doing?
Take that and that.
Take that.
Rascal..
Corrupt.
You dare make a false report.
Rascal..
Kaanchi.
Get up rascal.
Kaanchi, what are you doing?
Rascal.
She assaulted a government servant.
I will burn this police station down to ashes.
I will burn you alive here.
Let me go.
Who do you think you are?
Leave me.
Let me go.
Enough!
Who else are you going to kill?
First you destroyed him..
...now you want to destroy the village.
You want to fight them.
You want to fight the law.
No.
I won't let you do what you're thinking, Kaanchi.
I will.
I will do as I want.
- Kaanchi.
- Move aside.
- For my sake, Kaanchi.
- No oaths.
You're used to living like insects, but not me.
You want peace, but not me.
I don't want to live with you cowards..
- ..Who want to forget the truth.
- Kaanchi.
I won't forget it.
I will die but never forget it.
I won't forget it.
am going!
Don't try to find me.
Kaanchi.
Kaanchi.
Kaanchi stop.
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi, stop!
So Kaanchi...
...didn't die.
If she was dead, would I be sitting here, sir?
With the bruises, the beating, the wounds..
“The heartache.
After that Kaanchi swam across the river..
“And reached a village.
From there she travelled to Katgodam, Dehradoon.
And finally arrived in Mumbai.
Well, I am sorry to break this news, son.
Kaanchi leaped to her death and committed suicide.
It's not good for us.
She kept wandering around for 12 days“
...on a empty stomach.
Looking for whom?
Me, sir.
She didn't know anyone else here.
- No one.
- Why?
We were childhood friends.
She was looking for my address.
Sir.
Yes .
Do you know Ratanlal Bagula?
Yes, he's our chief.
Where can I find him?
Who are you?
I am from his village.
Where can I find him?
Same place where there's theft, robbery, girls and booze.
Where else?
Rascal.
It's me Kaanchi.
So you've come to Mumbai...
...to try your luck.
To be successful.
Quickly.
Short-time.
Great.
Doing great.
I've been rotting here for 7 years.
But I am still an insect in this city.
Listen to me carefully.
No means no.
I don't have a place for you.
Fine. I'll leave.
I'll sleep on the streets.
Starve to death.
But I will stay here.
I'll return home only when I am successful..
...when I've done something.
Determination.
I understand...
...what you want to be.
Katrina Ka if.
Come on, I'll make you Katrina Kaif.
See that?
VT Station.
Keep this.
Buy a ticket and head back home.
Get it?
Bye .
Come on India!
Come on India!
Come on India!
Come on India!
Come on India!
Come on India!
Come on India!
Come on India!
Come on India!
Sir, the youth have started lighting candles“
...in the day too.
Hail Bajrang“
Tea.
Sir, someone from the inquiry commission's here.
Can I call you back?
Jai Hind, sir.
What are you doing here?
Aren't you ashamed?
You threw a helpless girl from our village“
“out of our house.
She's my friend Teji's daughter.
She's looking for a job, like you did one day.
Kaanchi will stay here, with me.
Come, Kaanchi.
'I was shocked by her intelligence.'
'And what do I see next morning?'
So you convinced mother?
You've grown very smart, Kaanchi.
Now get up, today is a Sunday.
I want to see Mumbai.
"You're like a taxi."
I really am like a taxi.
You've become really naughty in Mumbai, Bagula.
Those who decide to come and die in Mumbai..
...Mumbai belongs to him.
Get it?
A city of big people, big stars.
Do you know Kakda?
Do you know Kakda?
How do you know him?
They're building a city in Koshampa.
Kakda. Tremendous power.
I'm one of his important men.
"Don't forget the childhood love."
You haven't changed.
Better, Kaanchi.
Much-much better.
Sigdi.
My name's Sigdi.
Did you forget?
My childhood name is Sigdi.
And I like it too.
Listen, get me a job with the Kakda's.
Don't you like me wearing these good clothes?
Why?
Impossible.
My job's still safe, and that's what matters.
Drink the cola and watch the sights.
I refused to get her a job at Shyam Kakda's house.
Believe me, sir.
She stood outside Shyam Kakda's house for 12 days.
To see who goes in, and who goes out.
And she started identifying every person going in or out.
And you know what she did one day?
She made Shyam Kakda's housekeeper, Maya, her target.
Where are you from?
Uttranchal.
What do you do?
I am looking for a job.
Anything, small household chores.
Maya sister, Vidya from our staff is on a month's leave.
So appoint her instead.
She looks poor.
I don'tjust look poor, I am.
What's your name?
- Sigdi.
- What?
Sigdi.
Do you know anyone here?
No.
No one?
Yes. I knowjust one person.
Dada,  news' report on the exit polls is..
...that Satyakam and the youth party..
...are getting stronger.
They are the only obstructions in our polls..
“And there's nothing else to worry about.
Dada, the situation is serious.
We'll have to do something.
Bagula, what's the news?
Sir, Satyakam has been talking rubbish in the media.
You know him.
He's your friend, isn't he?
Not actually.
- Vedant.
- Yes.
Call him.
- And this“
- Hold on.
Hello, sir, Satyakam speaking.
Yes, this is Vedant speaking.
On behalf of Shyam sir.
Why, can't Dada talk to me?
Look, Satyakam, just your name's Satyakam“
“but you're no honest person.
Brother has served the country for 50 years.
No, he's scavenged the country for 50 years.
The youth are really angry, sir.
And they're prepared to uproot you.
Satyakam, I comply with all your thoughts.
These discussions are just an exchange of words.
You move ahead, we're behind you.
God bless you my son.
He hung up.
Satya, it's not easy to expose Shyam Kakda.
It's not difficult either.
One day we'll definitely expose his lie.
What's this?
Didn't you hear?
I said "You move ahead, I am...right behind you".
Tell me Delhi's schedule, Savita.
The media's been favoring Satyakam because..
“They keep giving them secrets“
“through RTI or different contacts.
We'll have to do something.
Even I shouted slogans when I was young.
Let them.
They'll calm down eventually.
But what about the media?
The media's job is to shout.
Event to event, person to person.
They want to raise TRP.
When we do an event, our TRP soars.
When they show the event, their TRP soars.
Bagula.
What are you looking around for?
I've done your job.
Happy?
HaPPV?
What are you staring at?
On your reference I appointed Sigdi“
...in Vidya's place for a month.
Right, right, right.
- Can I meet her?
- No.
Is this house?
Now you've to do my son Ritesh's job.
Get it?
Those who come to Mumbai and decide to die..
...Mumbai belongs to him.
Thank you, Bagula.
"Kaanchi."
"Kaanchi."
What did you say her name was?
Sigdi.
Reference, Maya.
Thank God you're here.
Otherwise I've to do all this alone.
You don't know...
...the Kakda family are a big scoundrel..
Who else lives here?
JUSt the senior master.
Public meetings during day.
Private meetings at night.
He has a son too.
Yes, he does.
Shushant.
He's insane, completely mad.
Scoundrel.
Thank God he's gone to Dubai for a month.
They've a big house out there.
Kaanchi has committed suicide.
I am sorry, but you were too obsessed with that girl.
I am sure someone will definitely come from there.
To destroy you.
Who?
Some youngster from Koshampa.
Shake hands.
What are you doing?
Shushant.
I am Kakda, you know that.
Kakda.
So just chill.
Who else do you have here?

He's a party worker with Sanjay Pathar.
I had a mother.
But she passed away last year.
Do you have a mother?
- Yes, I do.
- Where?
In the village.
I really miss my mother.
Don't you.
That's how mothers are.
She yells, beats us, then she cries..
“And then feeds us.
'For 25 days she waited for Shushant.'
'But he didn't come.'
You look sexy in this hairstyle.
I like the way you call me sexy, Savita.
Did you see anything?
Yes .
Savita was combing your hair.
And you were kissing“
What you saw...
...you did not see.
And if you tell anyone what you saw.
Then you won't be able to see yourself tomorrow.
Sweet girl.
Go.
Sir.
Jhoomar sir's call for you.
Yes, Jhooma r.
What did you see?
What you saw...you did not see.
Get that?
Good girl.
"Kaanchi."
There's a powerful failure outside the bungalow.

Where's Sigdi?
She's gone to call her aunt.
I see.
The electrician's here.
We'll have power back on in a while.
Sir's sleeping inside.
Don't disturb him.
My brother Sanjay called.
He was asking when is Shyam Dada..
“Getting you a MLA ticket?
I said I don't know.
I know your aspirations of becoming a minister.
I've been with you for 9 years.
I gave you everything.
That's why I am with you too.
Forget it.
We should talk about public matters in a private room.
Make love, with a system.
You and your system.
I love you...Savita.
Siam!
Call her.
Yes .
She hung up.
Mohanlal, open that door.
I hope you remember, tomorrow“

You will have to come as my guest.
Savita, you know.
I've to attend Godrej's Holi party.
You won't go there.
Is that a threat?
Yes, it is.
If you don't come...
...then I'll have to request“
“Satyakam to come there.
...you will have to join his party.
Maybe.
You'll have to tell him my secrets.
You said...
...anything's possible in politics.
Savita.
You're my confidante.
Yes, I am loyal.
Swiss Banks, millions in scams.
That boy's murder in Koshampa Valley..
“And your relations with girls.
I've hidden everything in my heart for all these years.
And even Sanjay doesn't know this.
For 9 years I've given you everything.
You must understand.
My patience is running out.
- Vedant.
- Yes, Dada.
You were right, Savita's running out of patience.
I was thinking...
...Savita will have to pass our ordeal.
We'll have to erase Savita's name from our list.
But with a system.
Who's going in sir's room?
Check.
Balbeer, check who's at the back?
See, someone's there.
Hello. This is Nattu,

He's gone mad.
But youmlittle girl“
If you value your life, then“
“get out of this house in 3 minutes.
And don't even dream about this man.
Just save your life and get out.
Get out!
God favors the brave.
Mission JB successful.
But a bad news was waiting ahead.
The entire city's under a shock..
...because Shyam Kakda's secretary“
“Savita Pathare died in a bomb blast yesterday.
Who and how this bomb blast took place..
...the government has no answer.
Shyam Kakda's personal secretary Savita Pathare“
...who was present here during the incident“
...fell prey to the bomb blast.
Home Minister's secretary JB Godbole has stated that..
...terrorist from the neighboring country..
...can be behind this bomb blast.
And an enquiry commission has been appointed.
This is women killing.
Sister Savita was very nice woman.
Savita Pathare was supposed to get the MLA ticket.
But unfortunately, she fell prey along with 4 other people.
This is Jananta, Zee News.
Savita's death isn't just a loss to the country“
“but for me too.
Savita was the daughter of this country.
She was a rising youth.
She was the future.
May God give peace to Savita's soul.
Hello.
Can I speak to Manjari?
The rival country hasn't done a good thing“
...by killing her.
The enemy should know our strength.
Those rascal terrorists killed sister Savita.
That's why I was calling you.
I lost my phone.
Lost.
Hold on.
I found this phone in the garden.
This is my phone.
Come on India.
Come on India.
Come on India.
Come on India.
Come on India.
Come on India.
Where's that India that was better than the rest.
We got it.
Not one, but two.
We politicians concentrate more on power..
“And less on doing our jobs.
We spend 70% of our time in party politics.
And do less development.
The real leaders are those“
...who take the demands of the poor to the Parliament.
We'll have to erase Savita's name from our list.
But with a system.
Terrorists kill innocent people and leave.
When girls like Nirbhaya get raped my heart aches.
My heart aches seeing these poor people.
My heart aches when I see these kids.
Protection of women is my first responsibility.
What other responsibilities do you have?
Do tell us.
Shyam Kakda!
Calm down. Everyone calm down.
This is a game of the opposition party.
Look...Satyakam's party is..
I am standing right here.
And I will stand here.
No one can budge me.

I will shoot you.
I am police officer, you know.
Look, Kaanchi, you're angry.
But no matter what you do, the world won't change?
Will the country change?
What's there is there.
I used to say the same thing.
What's there is there.
But what there won't stay for long.
It won't.
Now only the right thing will happen.
What's right!
This is my fight.
And I will fight it alone.
What will you do, Bagula?
You bow before these devils.
You only run your home, not the country.
And that's why you cannot shoot me.
Ican.
I destroyed Shyam Kakda.
His power.
Jhoomar Babu. JB.
All of Shushant's strength.
And now I will finish Shushant.
You can do whatever you want.
Go.
I am going, and if you have the guts“
“then shoot me in the back.
I'll apologies to her.
I'll convince her.
If you bring her to me..
...l'll give you 5 million, in cash.
If you don't, you know how dangerous I am, right.
Many people have calling about you.
- It's getting dangerous.
- I know.
Do one thing, go in the office.
Get ready and then come back.
Come.
Where have you brought me?
Thank you my friend.
There's 5 million in that bag.
You kept your promise, here's your reward.
Thank you, sir.
Forgive me for taking a peek.
Here's your memorabilia.
Can I go?
- Thanks.
- Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Bagula. Rascal.
You betrayed me.
You dare sell me out.
I will kill you first.
Bagula.
Obsession.
Obsession.
After you left...
...l could see only your face in every painting.
Your gleam.
Your eyes.
These cheeks.
These lips.
I still love you.
I will make another painting of you.
Naked.
Nude.
You can kill me if you want.
No so easily.
You should feel the same pain I did.
Look.
Look. Look.
Look.
Ba**** wrong timing.
Sir, this is not the way.
Out.
Sir, this isn't right.
Sigdi snatched my gun.
I am a police officer, sir.
- Out.
- This isn't right, sir.
You bring Kaanchi's sister home and don't tell me.
- This isn't right.
- Out.
This isn't right, sir, you're pointing a gun at me.
I am your servant, your friend.
I am loyal to you.
And you're pointing a gun at me. At me.
There's just one way to show you.
And that is to kill you, sir.
Kaanchi, run away.
I'll deal with this rascal.
Now watch my way.
Take this. And that.
And this.
Nini.
Nini.
Fight.
Kill me.
Kill me.
So where did Kaanchi go?
To her village Koshampa.
With her mother.
Just like Kakda fled from Koshampa..
“Without leaving any evidence.
Similarly, Kaanchi returned to her village“
“without leaving any evidence.
You mean Kaanchi fled from the law.
One, two, three, four.
Come on, come on, jump.
Jump, come on.
One, two, three, four.
"Stay in my sights."
"Stay in my sights."
Sir.
Is it true that you gave orders to close Kaanchi's file?
What do you think?
Who is right?
Kaanchi or Kakda.
Sir, there's tremendous pressure from the superiors.
I'm getting calls from Delhi.
- Let it ring.
- But, sir..
Leave it.
You do know Arindham Barua from Delhi Office.
'75 batch.
One day when he was drunk he told me that“
“the minister gave him his unnamed flat“
...to change two lines in his report.
More than 60% politician politicians“
...have amassed from 100 to 1000 crores in 10 years.
From system.
The law is sold outside the court.
Deals are made with the media.
MLAs are bought and sold in party politics.
MPs are bought and sold.
Businessmen make the news laws of business.
Wow!
You do know that.
You, me, we all know it.
Yet, we keep quiet.
Because we're slaves of the system.
And these politicians make this system, control it..
“And break it too.
Corruption dwells in our blood, Gautam.
What a shame.
But Kaanchi's the new youth.
She gave a fitting reply to a power like Kakda..
...from her system.
And said...Fear no Evil.
And do what is right.
And that's why I closed Kaanchi's file.
And I know I'm doing the right thing.
Because I feel good.
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi!
Kaanchi!
You know, Kaanchi..
“Both the Kakdas were sentenced to 15 years ofjail.
The court has also cancelled Kakda's project.
Koshampa's lands were returned too.
With the grace of God.
Right.
You were furious for no reason and left us.
Everything became alright after you. Right?
