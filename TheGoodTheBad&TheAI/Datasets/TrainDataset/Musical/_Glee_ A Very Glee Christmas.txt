So here's what you missed
on Glee:
to another school, and Will's
trying to get used to the fact
that Emma went to Vegas with
her boyfriend
- I'm happy for you.
Brittany thinks Artie's
the best boyfriend ever.
You're magic, Brittany.
Which is what Rachel used to
think about Finn.
But then she learned this
secret about him and Santana
- Do you think she's prettier than me?
- So she made out with Puck,
- which made Finn super mad.
- I'm done with you!
Because his girlfriends are
always making out with Puck.
Boyfriend troubles.
I got that covered.
Considering I'm usually
the cause of them,
I'd say I'm an expert.
It's like a thing. And that's
what you missed on Glee.
- Hey, Will.
- Hey.
Are we okay?
You know, we haven't
really talked
since I told you
about me and Carl.
I mean, we haven't
talked at all.
Are you avoiding me?
Not at all.
So, what are you doing for
Christmas this year?
Just a little quiet time alone
this year.
Will, you can't spend Christmas
by yourself. That's horrible.
Look, um, Carl and I are having
a big Christmas Eve party.
Please at least stop by.
Well, thanks, Emma, that's very
sweet of you guys, but...
I think it's best if we just
keep things separate
for a while.
Yeah, okay.
BEISTE:
Okay, educators, gather around.
It's time to pick
your Secret Santa.
Everybody's name
is in the tub.
You get who you get, and you
don't get upset, all right?
BRITTANY:
There.
Last year, I left my stocking
up over Christmas vacation,
and an entire family of mice
started living in it.
Their Christmas gift to
each other was rabies.
I told my parents that I
only want one thing
for Christmas this year:
Stop friend requesting me on
Facebook.
What are you
asking Santa for?
- I'm sorry?
- Artie...
The roads to the North Pole
are getting treacherous.
You need to write your
letter to Santa really fast
and get it in
the mail today.
And remember, even the smallest
envelope is heavy for an elf.
No way.

We're on the
island of misfit toys.
Here we don't want to stay.
We want to travel
with Santa Claus
in his magic sleigh.
A pack full of toys
means a sack full of joys
for millions of girls and
for millions of boys...
When Christmas Day is here.
The most wonderful day
of the year.
A jack-in-the-box waits for
children to shout...
"Wake up! Don't you know that
it's time to come out?"
When Christmas Day is here.
The most wonderful day
of the year.
Toys galore,
scattered on the floor.
There's no room for more.
And it's all because
of Santa Claus.
A scooter for Jimmy.
QUINN:
A dolly for Sue.
The kind that will even say...
"How do you do?"
When Christmas Day is here.
The most wonderful day
of the year.
How would you like to be
a spotted elephant?
Or a choo-choo with square
wheels on your caboose?
Or a water pistol
that shoots... jelly?
We're all misfits!
If we're on the island of
unwanted toys,
we'll miss all the fun
with the girls and the boys
when Christmas Day is here.
The most wonderful, wonderful,
wonderful, wonderful,
wonderful day of the year!
Hey, guys.
What's this?
Oh, we're trying to get into
the Christmas spirit, Mr. Shue.
Christmas is totally my favorite
holiday. And check out
this awesome tree! I found it on
the side of the road.
It must have fell off
some guy's car.
- And the ornaments?
- The guy who lives next door
finally killed off his elderly mother.
And when they carted him off,
they left the house, like,
wide open, so...
I think she was
a holiday hoarder.
Uh... And the presents?
I lifted them from a display at the mall.
But don't worry. They're empty.
Guys, look,
I appreciate the effort,
but this isn't what Christmas is
supposed to be like.
For us, it is.
This tree is like a mascot for
Glee Club.
We won Sectionals
two years in a row,
and according to everyone
at this school, we still suck.
...this reindeer sweater last
year...
- Ooh!
- Ho-Ho-Ho, losers.
Haha!
I'm pretty sure they just added
food coloring
to real slush
from the parking lot.
You can eat that,
you know.
No, no. I am not
gonna let you guys throw
yourselves a pity party.
Look, I'm the first one to say
that things haven't turned out
exactly how I would have liked
them to this year, but Christmas
is all about being grateful for
the things that did.
I thought that was Thanksgiving.
And this year, Glee Club is
going to lend a hand
to the McKinney-Vento Homeless
Children and Youth program
- right here in Lima.
- How are we going to do that?
The only way we know how:
By singing about it.
We're going to go classroom
to classroom,
caroling, to raise money for
McKinney-Vento.
Wait, classrooms in this school?
With like, students in them?
Well, if there are no students
in them, there will be no one
to put money in the collection
box while we sing.
We're gonna be killed.
No, guys, it's Christmas...
A time for miracles.
We got to try this.
Finn's right.
So let's start rehearsing.
This year, Glee Club's going
full Santa.
Haul out the holly.
Put up the tree before my
spirit falls again!
Fill up the stocking.
I may be rushing things,
but deck the halls again now...
- You suck!
- Who goes caroling with a band?
I'd seriously rather be learning.
For we need a little Christmas...
You're making me hate Christmas!
Right this very minute...
Candles in the wind...
GIRL: Yeah, that's right, leave!
- You suck! I hate you!
- FINN: Go, go, go!
RACHEL: I can't believe
that that teacher
let those students speak
to us like that.
I can't believe she
threw her shoe at us.
I guess we're done caroling.
No, we're not, guys.
We can't let what just happened
ruin our Christmas spirit.
Mr. Shue got us this beautiful
tree to inspire us.
We're gonna practice now, and
gear up for round two tomorrow.
Pretty soon,
no one will bully us.
Santa Claus can do anything,
and this year,
I asked for the Glee Club to
stop getting picked on.
She's kidding, right?
Guys, this is serious.
Listen up.
Brittany still believes
in Santa Claus.
- You cannot be serious.
- Last week, Brittany believed a comb had magic powers.
- This is kind of a pattern.
- QUINN: She's gonna find out sooner or later.
Would you mind, um...
- meeting me at the auditorium tomorrow at 4:00?
- Sure.
- Okay, somebody needs to break the news to her.
- Uh-uh. Don't look at me.
I mean, I'm cruel and all,
but that's just hardcore.
Right! That's my point!
Hear me out.
Remember when you were a kid,
how excited you would get
when you would think
about Santa Claus?
How awesome it was?
Christmas was the highlight
of the year.
Why wouldn't you want to keep
someone's world
magical for a little while
longer?
- How?
- I've got it all figured out.
Can I be honest?
I don't understand the difference
between an elf and a slave.
I'm not sitting
on that guy's lap.
Santas' laps are always
really warm, and it's creepy.
We all have to sit on Santa's lap.
If Brittany sees that we
all still believe, it will make
her strong enough to withstand
all the Santa naysayers
in the world.
Which is everyone
over the age of six.
I'm pretty sure
this isn't going to work.
That guy doesn't
even look like Santa.
Trust me, all Brittany's gonna
see is the suit.
She wants to believe in him.
Mercedes, get up there.
Go, Mercedes, go, Mercedes, go.
MERCEDES:
I've been a very good girl, Santa.
I want a pony, and a doll
that laughs and cries and...
One of us smells like McDonalds.
I would like Puckerman to
love me. He's a fox.
I would also like
sweet potato fries.
I want bling. I can't be any
more specific than that.
Okay, wait, hold up.
Please tell me that is a roll
of Certs in your pocket.
Do you have anything
for stretch marks?
ChapStick. Lots of ChapStick.
I want Channing Tatum
to stop being in stuff.
When does Asian Santa arrive?
Next.
Just know, you have rights.
SANTA:
Ho, ho, ho!
- What's your name?
- Brittany.
You've gotten really tan.
That's because at the North Pole
there's a hole in the ozone.
You're amazing.
I know you're really busy,
so I only want one
thing for Christmas.
Do you see my
boyfriend over there?
For Christmas, I want
him to be able to walk.
You can do that,
can't you, Santa?
Sure... I'm on it.
- Thank you so much, Santa.
- Now we're screwed.
Now, remember,
it has to be lush and romantic.
Why?
Because I am very specific
when I give a gift.
You don't know how many kittens
I've given away because they
haven't been just right.
So, do you like my
winter wonderland?
Well, I don't really like
artificial Christmas trees.
I like real ones.
They smell amazing.
That's kind of the whole point.
Right.
Anyway...
Merry Christmas.
Being a Jew, I generally
don't give Christmas gifts,
but considering how much you
care about the holiday
I figured I'd
make an exception.
Just... Read it.
It's a note.
"The bearer of this note is
entitled to one song
of Rachel Berry's choosing,
sung to him or her with love."
At least it's not a kitten.
- Come sit.
- I... I don't think so.
I know what you're trying to do,
and it's not going to work.
Look, not letting me apologize
isn't fair.
I've let you apologize
plenty, and I know
that Christmas is supposed to
be about forgiveness but...
I'm not ready to forgive you,
so please stop trying to make me.
- Should we, like, leave?
- No.
Whether it's a heart attack or
heartbreak,
just like on Broadway,
the show must go on.
Besides, the AV Club worked so
hard on the snow.
Greeting cards
have all been sent.
The Christmas rush
is through.
But I still have
one wish to make:
A special one for you.
Merry Christmas, darling.
We're apart, that's true.
But I can dream,
and in my dreams,
I'm Christmasing with you.
Holidays are joyful.
There's always something new.
But every day's a holiday
when I'm near to you.
Oh, the lights on my tree,
I wish you could see.
I wish it every day.
Ah-ah-ah-ah...
And the logs on the fire
fill me with desire
to see you and to say
that I wish you Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, darling...
Happy New Year, too.
I've just one wish
on this Christmas Eve:
On this Christmas Eve...
I wish I were with you.
I wish I were...
with...
You...
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas...
Merry Christmas...
Merry Christmas...
Darling...
Darling...
Hey.
You scared me.
Good. Because I'm
actually Marley's ghost, and
:
I'm here to tell you
to stop studying so hard.
KURT:
Hmm. What's with the boom box?
I need you to sing with me.
Well, rehearse with me.
I got a gig singing
"Baby, It's Cold Outside"
in the King's Island
Christmas Spectacular.
Ah, a personal favorite.
Too bad they'd never
let us sing it together.
I mean, as two... artists.
Mmm. So you going to
help me out here?
Anything to get me to stop
reading about Charlemagne.
Very good, then.
I really can't stay.
But baby,
it's cold outside.
I've got to go away.
But baby, it's cold outside.
This evening has been...
Been hoping that
you'd drop in.
So very nice.
I'll hold your hands,
they're just like ice.
My mother will
start to worry.
Beautiful,
what's your hurry?
My father will be
pacing the floor.
Listen to the fireplace roar.
So really, I'd better scurry.
Beautiful,
please don't hurry.
But maybe just
half a drink more.
Put some records
on while I pour.
The neighbors might faint.
Baby, it's bad out there.
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there.
I wish I knew how...
Your eyes are like starlight now.
To break this spell.
I'll take your hat,
your hair looks swell.
I ought to say
"No, no, no, sir."
Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna
say that I tried.
What's the sense
in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay.
Baby, don't hold out.
BOTH:
Oh, but it's cold outside.
I've gotta get home.
But baby,
you'd freeze out there.
Say, lend me a coat.
It's up to your knees
out there.
You've really been grand.
I thrill when
you touch my hand.
But don't you see?
How can you do
this thing to me?
There's bound to be
talk tomorrow.
Think of my
life-long sorrow...
At least there will be
plenty implied.
If you got pneumonia
and died.
I really can't stay.
Get over that hold out.
Ooh, baby, it's cold...
Oh, but it's cold...
Outside!
Outside!
I think you're ready.
Well, for the record,
you are much better than
that girl's going to be.
Hey.
Mr. Schuester.
Oh, good to see you, Kurt.
Someone special?
No, just a friend.
But on the upside,
I am in love with him,
and he's actually gay.
I call that progress.
How you doing?
Classes are harder,
but the kids are kinder.
But I miss you guys a lot,
though.
So what brings you here?
Are you looking
for teaching at a place
where pencils aren't
primarily used as weapons?
Actually, I need
some holiday help.
I don't know if you know this,
but I am really bad
at Christmas shopping.
Oh, honey,
just what I wanted.
Jumper cables.
This year, I drew Sue
in the office pool Secret Santa.
And I tell you,
I can't think of anything good.
And you are so great
at shopping,
- I thought I'd...
- I have the perfect idea.
I think I can tell
who wrapped that.
Who's it for?
Oh, Sue.
I drew her as my Secret Santa.
Wait a minute.
That's not possible.
- Sue's my Secret Santa.
- No, Sue's my Secret Santa.
I'm everybody's Secret Santa.
Yeah, you can just
drop those wherever.
You rigged Secret Santa?
How? It was my idea.
Well, you're not the only person
at this school
who consumes protein powder
by the tubful.
Remember when I told you
I was taking
all those science textbooks
to an exorcist?
Well, that's what we call
a diversion.
You filled your tub
with your name only.
You're a regular
Agatha Christie,
except even more sexless.
See, people, I hate Christmas,
but I love presents.
Ah, look at this.
It's a track suit
with a fur-lined hood
for the winter months.
Thanks, fella.
That was Kurt's idea.
Ah-ah-ah, William.
These gifts are legally mine.
Now, you may or may
not be aware of this,
but I'm an honorary officer
of the Lima Police Department,
and if you take my property
out of my office,
I will pick up that phone and
have you arrested for theft.
We are not going to let you
steal Christmas, Sue.
- You're not going to get away with this.
- I think I already have.
William, Elmo, you,
get the hell out of my office.
I just got to say, this
is a really expensive blender.
It's top of the line.
At ease, Becky.
I'm gonna stop you right here.
Why are you wearing that hat?
Because it's Christmas
and it's fun.
No, it's offensive.
You're wearing a Santa Claus hat,
and yet you're handing me
no gifts. I need gifts.
- You want my hat?
- It's a start.
Coach, we've got a problem.
WILL:
Thanks, guys.
Those go under the tree
in the choir room.
Plop it down there.
Thank you.
Can you believe it?
Six different people
got Sue a Shake Weight.
Mmm.
Becky, go into the glove box
of my LeCar
and bring me my tear gas.
Then, get me Gloria Allred.
Merry Christmas, Sue.
As you can see, we're
repo'ing your gifts.
Most can't be returned
since you inexplicably opened
all of them.
And I licked each one
so no one would touch them.
So the staff has
agreed to donate them
to the homeless kids
at McKinney-Vento.
I mean, what is your
problem anyway?
Were you one
of those kids
who never got presents
at Christmas?
Yes, Dr. Laura.
As a matter of fact, I was,
and I'm making up for it now.
Face it, Sue. We won.
This will not stand.
I have legal rights
to those gifts.
You know what, Sue?
You don't.
I checked with
Human Resources,
and because you
misrepresented yourself,
it is within our legal right
to take back these gifts.
Ho, ho, ho.
You know what you are, Sue?
You're a grinch.
Are you guys punking me?
I thought we were cool after
you sang me that song.
This is serious, Coach.
Remember when you were a kid,
the way you felt
when you came downstairs
on Christmas morning,
seeing that Santa had come?
I do love Santa Claus.
One year, I asked him
for a full set of free weights.
Kept asking my dad,
"How did Santy get
those 75-pound dumbbells
down the chimney?"
Should have suspected something
when Dad was in traction
until the end of January.
You've got the perfect
Santa body type.
Watch it, Puckerman.
Look, we rented the suit.
All you need to do
is put it on.
Just tell her
that you can't give her
the gift of me
walking this year.
That seems so harsh
and not at all like Santa.
She asked Santa
for the impossible:
Me walking again.
If Christmas morning
comes around and I'm not
dancing in Glee Club rehearsal
with no personal explanation
from her idol, she's going
to lose faith in Old Saint Nick,
and we can't have that.
Tell her the elves
are working on it.
Elves have awesome cord blood
for stem cell research,
but these advances
are a few years away.
Okay.
Great. And then we need you
to break into her house.
- What? No, no way!
- The back door will be open.
I talked to her parents. They
really want her to believe, too.
BECKY:
Look, Coach.
The janitor staff
got you hideous gloves.
SUE:
Give me those.
They'll come in handy.
No fingerprints.
Suit up, Becky.
I don't understand
why we have to dress up, Coach.
Well, this way,
if anyone sees us,
we'll have plausible
deniability.
I repeat, you are a "rein-dog."
Trust me, they're real.
How am I looking?
Fantastic, Coach.
Yeah, you know, Becky,
my mastery of camouflage
is the only thing
that kept me
from being court-martialed
after that My Lai
misunderstanding.
Copy that.
Now, let's go get
what is rightfully mine.
Schuester thinks I'm a grinch,
well, that's exactly
what he's gonna get.
You're a mean one,
Sue the Grinch.
You really are a heel.
You're as cuddly as a cactus,
you're as charming as an eel,
Sue the Grinch.
You're a bad banana with a...
A greasy black peel.
You're a monster,
Sue the Grinch.
Your heart's an empty hole.
Your brain is full of spiders.
You've got garlic in your soul,
Sue the Grinch.
I wouldn't touch you with
a 39-and-a-half-foot pole.
You're a foul one,
Sue the Grinch.
You're a nasty, wasty skunk.
Your heart is full of
unwashed socks.
Your soul is full of gunk,
Sue the Grinch.
Becky, load it up.
Santa?
Why, Brittany.
What are you doing here?
I'm bringing a gift to put under
the tree for the homeless kids.
It's a dollhouse.
At least their dolls
won't be homeless.
What are you doing, Santa?
Well, you see, Brittany,
uh, one of the lights
on the tree
isn't working.
So I'm bringing it back
home to my workshop.
I'll fix it up there,
and I'll bring it back here.
Oh.
Shuffle on home.
They took everything.
Including all of Sue's
Secret Santa gifts
we were gonna give
to the homeless kids.
RACHEL:
Only further proof
that everyone in this school
hates us no matter what we do.
It's not the school.
It's Sue.
She did this.
It wasn't Sue, it was Santa.
He said a light was out on
the tree, he'd fix everything.
We just need to let him
do his thing.
Okay.
Are you sure
Santa was a boy
and not a girl, Brittany?
I swear on my life.
Santa's a boy.
Everybody knows that.
It was probably one of the boys
on the football team.
I guess it wasn't Sue.
So our tree is gone.
So our presents are missing.
Santa's probably fixing any
dents or chips as we speak.
FINN:
All around the world today,
way worse things have happened
to people than this.
Sorry, but I'm not going
to let this get us down.
'Tis the season.
I agree. Come on, guys,
let's clean this up.
Come on.
Finn.
You and I are
the leaders of this club.
All right,
we need to fix this.
We have to put everything
that's happened behind us
and save Christmas
for the Glee Club.
I want to make this right.
You smell kind of funny.
Oh, I, um,
I put this on
for the car ride over.
I know how much you love
the smell of Christmas pine.
But guess I don't
really need it
now that we have the real thing.
It's so cold out.
It's cuddle weather.
It's unseasonably warm, actually,
for this time of year, but, uh...
I just, I really wanted
to come here with you.
I mean, the Christmas tree is
the foundation of Christmas.
It's the hearth of
the Christmas home.
Without it, there wouldn't be
anywhere to hang the ornaments
or put the presents under.
Yeah, yeah.
Whenever we put the tree up,
I always knew
Christmas was really here.
This one's too small.
- But, uh...
- Oh, I love this song.
It's, uh, it's my
favorite Christmas song.
It's Wham!
Yeah, yeah.
Cool.
Um...
I'm going to look down
this row of Frasier firs.
Maybe you could
check out the Douglases
and I'll meet you at the end.
Okay.
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart,
but the very next day,
you gave it away.
This year,
to save me from tears,
I'll give it
to someone special.
Once bitten and twice shy,
I keep my distance,
but you still catch my eye.
Tell me, baby,
do you recognize me?
Oh...
Well, it's been a year...
It doesn't surprise me.
Christmas...
I wrapped it up and sent it
with a note saying
"I love you," I meant it.
Now I know
what a fool I've been.
But if you kissed me now,
I know you'd fool me again.
Last Christmas,
I gave you my heart,
And the very next day,
you gave it away.
Gave it away...
This year,
to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special.
Oh, oh, oh...
Last Christmas,
I gave you my heart...
Oh, oh...
You gave me away...
Oh...
I'll give it to someone special.
Last year, for Christmas,
I asked Santa to give me you.
It's not last year anymore.
It's Christmas, Finn.
It's time for you to forgive me.
No, I can't.
Okay, this is wrong.
I shouldn't...
I shouldn't have
brought you here.
You messed me up, Rachel.
Can't you see
how screwed-up I am about this?
I've had two girlfriends, and
both of them have cheated on me.
Maybe you can ask Santa again
for me next year.
I'm officially
breaking up with you.
This was my dad's.
He'd want you to do it.
For those kids.
This was my uncle's.
It's the first thing
I ever stole, actually.
I'm going to look terrible.
Shut up.
With your bone structure,
you could rock
the  look
and still look good.
I'm going to look
like Jackie Chan.
If Barbra can pull off a bob,
so can I.
Enough yapping, let's do this.
Whoa! Whoa!
What are you guys doing?
We're going all "Gift of
the Magi" to raise money
to buy homeless kids
those school supplies.
The guys are gonna
sell their watches
and the girls are gonna
sell off their hair.
- You can't do that.
- Oh, no, it's cool.
Most of this isn't mine,
anyways.
No, I mean,
that's not the answer.
There are other ways to raise
money at Christmastime.
No, but we tried caroling,
and it didn't work.
Wait, I thought you and Finn
were getting us a new tree.
We went, but Finn bailed
before we could get one.
Nice Christmas spirit, Finn.
WILL:
Wait!
Guys, no more fighting.
Have any of you ever actually
read "Gift of the Magi"?
None of you?
You don't have to read
"Gift of the Magi."
everybody knows what it's about.
Well, if you actually read it,
you'd know what it's about.
Yeah, I know what it's about:
Life freakin' sucks.
Actually, you're right.
The first Christmas
you remember having
is the greatest day
of your life.
Your family's all together,
there are loads
of presents, cookies.
The magic is
alive and well.
But before you know it,
you grow up.
Work and school
and girlfriends take over
and Christmas becomes
more of an obligation,
a reminder of what's lost
instead of what's possible.
And all of the trees
and the presents
and even the mistletoe
can't change that.
And then when
you get to my age...
you're so desperate
to get that magic back,
you'd do anything
to be able to feel
how you did
that first Christmas.
So what should we do?
Put your scissors down,
put your watches back on.
We're gonna go out
and find some people
who really need
some Christmas spirit,
and we are gonna sing for them.
Get a good night's rest, Ken,
you're gonna need it.
Barbie took the early flight
from Tampa.
Santa?
But it's too early.
Well, you know what they say.
Early's late if you make
tomorrow yesterday.
Awesome.
You know, Brittany,
I was in the neighborhood,
doing a dry run.
I have so many houses to
visit on Christmas Eve,
I got to make sure it
goes off without a hitch.
How about you come
sit with ol' Santy?
:
Okay!
How about you sit next
to Santy instead?
Santy's just a little stinky.
He needs a good ol'
sponge bath from Mrs. Claus.
Brittany, do you remember what
you asked me for for Christmas?
Yeah, I asked for Artie
to be able to walk.
Is there anything else
that you want?
I mean, like, anything?
No.
Well, see,
Santa's trying his best,
but that one's
a little hard.
But you're magic.
Sometimes what Santa
wants to give
a good girl like you is patience,
because, believe it or not,
there are even some things
that he can't manage.
You know,
there was a girl
a little younger than you
and she was a little husky.
She was always asking
Santy for the same thing:
To make her look
more like the other girls.
She wasn't asking to be
pretty or nothing.
But she just didn't want
to stick out so much.
Santa just couldn't do it.
So instead Santa
gave her patience.
And later on, that girl was...
Was glad that Santy didn't give
her what she had asked him for.
She... She put being
husky to good use.
Was her name Ricki Lake?
The point is...
I don't think I'm going
to be able to give you
what you're asking for,
even though I'd like to.
- But, Santa...
- I'm sorry, pumpkin.
It's... It's just not
going to happen.
Aren't you going
to go up the chimney?
On dry runs,
Santy uses the Isuzu.
What's going on?
I think I've lost
the Christmas spirit.
It's Santa.
I don't know if
I can tell you.
I used to believe that
Santa could do anything.
If Santa isn't magical,
I don't even know if I
want to believe anymore.
It isn't fair that you
can't walk, Artie.
I feel so terrible.
Hey, look at me.
I'm fine.
Hey, guys, we need you
in the teachers' lounge.
Mr. Shue...
Brittany's not feeling so good.
Santa thing.
If you don't mind,
I think I'm going
to take her home,
make sure she's okay.
Good idea. We'll
make do without you.
Hey, uh, so we're your students.
All year long you suffer
through dealing with us.
I imagine having some of us
in your classes
would slowly chip away at
your hopes and dreams,
until the whole world just felt
like a never-ending
- nightmare of pain...
- Just get to the point, Finn.
Right. Uh, anyway,
we're here today
to help raise money
for children that have a lot
less than we do.
And I know some of us
have had a hard Christmas,
but what we've come to learn
is that no matter
how tough things get,
there isn't anything
that more Santa
or a couple more jingle bells
can't cure.
SUE:
Well, Becky, we did it.
We got all my presents back.
And as satisfying
as it is to have been
gifted enough rotisserie ovens
to roast an entire hobo...
For me,
the real joy of Christmas
was breaking the collective
heart of the Glee Club.
What's that, Coach?
Fahoo fores, dahoo dores.
Welcome, Christmas,
come this way.
Fahoo fores, dahoo dores.
Welcome, Christmas,
Christmas Day.
BOYS:
Welcome, welcome, fahoo ramus.
GIRLS:
Welcome, welcome, dahoo, damus.
ALL:
Christmas Day is in our grasp,
so long as we have
hands to clasp.
Fahoo fores, dahoo dores.
Welcome, Christmas,
bring your cheer.
Fahoo fores, dahoo dores.
Welcome all Whos
far and near.
Welcome, Christmas,
fahoo ramus.
Welcome, Christmas,
dahoo damus.
Christmastime
will always be
just as long
as we have glee.
Fahoo fores, dahoo dores.
Welcome, Christmas,
bring your light.
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh-ooh...
Christmas came anyway, Coach.
It's beautiful.
It is.
How much did we raise?
And that's after my cut.
I'm kidding.
Now that you're divorced
and Ms. Pillsbury
married another guy,
I guess you'll be spending
Christmas Eve alone.
Yes, Rachel, I am.
Well, I know how painful
being alone can feel,
so if you want,
you can come over to my house.
We're going to eat Chinese
and watch .
Thanks, Rachel.
I think I'm going to pass.
Nothing wrong
with being alone.
Artie.
It's called a ReWalk.
Some guy in Israel
invented it.
I can't use it
all the time, but...
Check me out.
Where did you get it?
BRITTANY: We went home and
it was sitting under my Christmas tree.
How the hell did you
afford that thing?
BRITTANY:
I didn't buy it.
I didn't know what it was.
I thought it was
a Transformer.
I assumed her dad
got it for me,
but he has no idea
where it came from.
He went to take
a long poop, and when
he came back it was there.
So if no one we know
bought it for you, then...
Santa brought it.
Santa.
Santa.
A real Christmas miracle.
Hey, Will.
How...How did you get in here?
Oh, I had a key made
ages ago.
How do you like your tree?
Uh, it's... It's...
It's beautiful.
Wh... What's going on?
What's with all the presents?
Well, you remember that
old meanie who stole
all that stuff out
of the choir room?
Well, she's sorry.
Really?
And what made her
change her mind?
I don't know.
Call it a Christmas miracle
and we'll leave it at that.
Now I know a lot of these gifts
are for orphans or something,
but, uh... I got you
something special.
It's okay, it's not
going to explode.
I thought you might want to put
all of us out of our misery
and shave off that Chia Pet.
Thanks, Sue.
The tree really does look great.
Well, Santa had some helpers.
No one should be alone
on Christmas Eve, Mr. Schuester.
SUE: Too much talking, lady,
not enough trimming.
Come on, let's get some
Christmas up in here.
I thought you
hated the holidays.
No, I just hate you.
Merry Christmas, Sue.
Merry Christmas, Will.
