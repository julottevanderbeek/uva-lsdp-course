PART ONE
"Lady Perfection"
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning. Any news?
Nothing much, sir. 3 murders,
an earthquake in South Cockatoo
and...
... a flying saucer, sir.
Anything new on your street?
- New? On our street?
- Hurry up, hurry up!
- On our street?
- I'm coming, mister Willkins.
I'm waiting. Hurry!
I couldn't sleep all night,
I am so eager to hear...
... the end of the story with
Astute Bill!
In last night's edition the
fearless detective finds out...
... that the stolen diamonds are
in the possession of a woman.
I hope you will find out who she
is, Mr. Willkins. - Thank you.
Eddie! My boy went out without
a raincoat!
Eddie! Don't you ever come near
those awful stray dogs!
- Ed, come home!
- Good morning, miss Lark.
Good morning. Just look
at this monster.
To say nothing of his pedigree.
Half poodle, half terrier.
And he took the worst from
both.
Here's your "Dog Herald" with
the results of the exhibition.
Thank you so much.
How many times did I tell you
to stay away from stray dogs!
Go away, fleabag!
Stay where you are!
- Good morning, admiral Boom.
- Are they here yet?
- Thank god, not yet!
- The flying saucer still there?
The papers write that chances
of aliens coming here are...
I don't care what they write!
If there are chances, that
means there is a threat.
- Put your stupid papers into
the mailbox. - Yes, sir.
Wait! What is the weather
outside?
The cool westward wind
intensifies, admiral.
The devices fail me again!
God damn my spleen!
Morning, mister Robertson.
Writing a new song?
- What's it about this time?
- Listen.
Hey you, villainous nanny Cathy,
You left, and the children
have no nanny.
There's noise and din
all over the place.
All hell broke loose without
a nanny!
And I go on condemning her, only
I didn't write that yet.
My sympathy. It is your ad in
the morning paper:
"Jane and Michael Banks, to say
nothing of their parents..."
- And I should add, their uncle.
- Oh yes, uncle.
"... are in need of a good nanny
or governess...
who would go for a meagre
salary. Urgent." - Yes.
I hope you wouldn't have
to wait long.
Hold this, will you?
Hey you, underground admiral!
Quit the masquerade!
Join in.
Hey you, underground admiral!
Quit your masquerade!
Underground admiral,
quit your masquerade!
"... a good nanny... meagre
salary. Address: 17, Cherry St."
Now all we have to do is wait
until nannies come queuing...
... at our porch, eager to get
the most meagre salary.
If we can't offer a big salary,
... it is better that we say so
in the first place.
So far, if crowds do gather
at your porch,
... it is to marvel at your
dear brother - the idler.
Don't you dare call him that.
He writes songs!
He needs peace and seclusion,
and I personally...
I personally understand him
very well.
Father, what else do they write
about the flying saucer?
Maybe. If I were you I would
mind...
my own saucers and not stick my
nose where it doesn't belong.
Oh, my god!
Another earthquake in
South Cockatoo!
Your children are left
without a nanny!
But I just bought shares
of "Cockatoo-orange Co."
I think I am on the verge of
having a nervous breakdown.
You don't concern yourself with
problems of world economy!
I'm enough concerned with having
to economize on everything.
If you wouldn't...
... waste so much time on your
"Cherry Street Women's League",
... I'm sure the issue with the
nanny wouldn't be that acute.
So you think women of Cherry St.
must bear with admiral Boom's...
Admiral Boom is not a fool in
the first place...
A reliable cover from aliens
wouldn't hurt nowadays.
- Yes. - George, what are
you conceiving this time?
Nothing. Only to go to work.
- Make money. Make money,
darling. - Father!
Father! You promised to tell us
where money comes from.
Your mother will better tell you
where it disappears.
Have you finished your milk?
Go to your bedroom and play.
Did you hear what your father
said? March to your room!
- Jane.
- I'm coming.
There was a blue luminescence,
then the object disappeared.
Sir Timothy Green from the
Observer smiled skeptically...
and remarked that people are
disposed to wishful thinking.
I can only say that the Eastern
wind is intensifying,
the night will be cool, and
tomorrow it will start raining.
Naum Nohl from the Times wrote:
"Bad weather is popular today".
But let's not grieve, instead
let us think about our health.
And now - morning exercises!
- Shall we play "Hit-ship"?
- We played it yesterday.
What's new?
Admiral Boom is wiping his
periscope. And cursing.
- It's his favorite "God damn
my spleen!"? - Can't hear.
Mrs. Lark came out into the
garden, Robert is in his tent.
Michael! What was that?
- I think it was it.
- What?
The saucer!
Remember, dad said they were
luminescent.
Look!
My name is Mary Poppins.
Yes, yes, of course. Please
do come in.
You'll see, they are very
obedient children.
And you will have no
problems with them.
You do have references from
the Nannies' Union?
My rule: no references.
- But everyone must...
- A very old-fashioned custom.
Totally outdated and useless.
Please. The children's
room is upstairs.
Jane, Michael, meet your new
nanny - Mary Poppins.
So it's a deal then?
Almost. If I find it suitable.
- Do you want to take us?
- Michael, mind your manners.
I accept the job,
... Mrs. Banks.
"I accept the job, Mrs. Banks".
One would think she was
doing us a favor.
Why not?
Dammit! The Antarctic Bank
went bankrupt!
My money is lost again.
I knew it! I knew it!
I'm in stress!
When you were a common clerk, we
weren't afraid of anything.
A man is bound to get lucky
some time.
Mr. Banks, would you turn off
that music, if you please.
I personally prefer live music.
- What's live music?
- All in it's time.
It is live music that gives me
real pleasure.
I hope, you feel the same.
And remember once and for all:
... Mary Poppins doesn't repeat
twice.
She must have come here
in a flying saucer.
I knew right away. You are a
humanoid.
You came so suddenly, as if you
were carried by a gust of wind.
It is exactly so.
Do you understand?
I understand!
Speaking of live music.
Piano by "Madam Corry", early
But that doesn't mean you don't
have to drink up your milk.
And now...
Go to sleep!
Mary Poppins, you won't ever
leave us, will you?
You won't leave us?
Another word from that corner,
and I will call a policeman.
We just wanted to say, we...
... know you will stay with us
for a long time.
I will.
I will stay, until the wind
changes direction.
It is so good!
It is wonderful!
From year to year the weather
changes.
Bad weather becomes popular
nowadays. Bad weather!
Water gushes in on us from the
sky as though from a water-pipe.
Bad weather stays on for 6
months, and there's nowhere...
Bad weather stays on for 6
months, and there's nowhere...
There's nowhere we can hide,
But we can't delay our life
for later.
There's nowhere we can hide,
but somewhere there...
there's someone in the rain
looking for you!
The fearful peals of thunder
from dusk till dawn...
Bad weather is the atonement
for the people's sins.
Not angina, not common cold.
It is a worse disaster.
Bad weather stays on for 6
months, and there's nowhere...
Bad weather stays on for 6
months, and there's nowhere...
There's nowhere we can hide,
But we can't delay our life
for later.
There's nowhere we can hide,
but somewhere there...
... there's someone in the rain
looking for you!
There's nowhere we can hide,
but somewhere there...
... there's someone in the rain
looking for you!
Michael!
Michael!
There's something missing.
I know! There was a piano there.
- Maybe we saw it in our dream?
- And the camp-bed too?
Jane!
Look, the piano!
- Is the camp-bed there?
- It is.
Mary Poppins, it's wonderful
you hadn't left.
We almost thought you were
a dream.
And your camp-bed. Where did
you sleep tonight?
Gentlemen never ask ladies
questions like that.
Hey!
Mister Hey, please take my
camp-bed...
... and put it in the nursery.
- Are you talking to me?
Well didn't I say it clearly:
Mister Hey? - I'll do it.
Only my name is Robert
Robertson. - Is that so?
Well can't do anything
about it now.
If I called you Mister Hey once,
you will have to be Mister Hey.
Be careful! I sleep only on this
bed, and on nothing else.
- Good morning, miss Poppins.
- Good morning.
- Nasty weather, isn't it?
- It depends.
At least for those who
save gasoline...
... and ride to the office
on a bicycle.
Mary! I must rush off to the
meeting of the "Women's League".
The children are getting dressed.
Will you feed them please?
Did you think I would let
them starve?
And if you would be so kind as
to make a few purchases...
Maybe. Maybe not.
In any case show me, where I
can find the pram.
You mean, the cart?
My brother is so clumsy, he took
it for a chair and sat on it.
I'm talking about Jane's
and Michael's old pram.
I'm not interested in anything
else. And I happen to know...
... it's in the storeroom.
- Really?
So it is.
But I don't understand,
what for?
Excellent. A most convenient
thing to transport buys!
You may go now.
Hey!
May I ask, why you call me
Mister Hey, Mary Poppins?
Mister Hey! I like that!
Mister Hey!
He starts all his songs with
a "Hey"!
Well of course it's Mister Hey!
How do you do, Mister Hey!
I don't like the way you
speak to your uncle.
Don't forget to turn off the gas
under the big pan,..
Mister Hey.
- Mrs. Lark, I beg you!
- My God! My boy got lost again!
We must call the police
and the fire brigade!
Poor, poor Mrs. Lark.
There he is! Near admiral
Boom's place!
My God, Edward! My little doggy!
Edward!
Oh, no! This horrible shaggy
mongrel again!
Go away! Go away! Edward,
come home this very minute!
To run away all alone, without a
coat! I am very displeased.
You have no heart for me,
Edward! Come home!
He says he is not coming home.
And how do you know what my dog
is saying, may I ask?
He is going home this instant.
He won't go without his friend.
How can he even think that I
will let in this shaggy animal?
- He says the issue is closed.
- What?!
That - after everything I've
done for you, Edward?
All right, all right, let it be
on your terms. But from now on
... my heart is broken forever.
Forever!
So it's decided.
I will name the dog Shaggy
or Boy.
No, his name is Bartholomew.
And no other name will do.
Bartholomew?!
That's all I need.
What else does he say?
He says he will come back
on one condition...
... That you will never make
him wear his coat.
- It's his final word.
- Very well..
But if you catch cold and start
sneezing, It will be your fault!
Do come in!
What a charming lady
moved to our neighborhood.
and quick. We're in a hurry.
In a hurry? What a pity.
What a pity!
I was hoping you would stay a
while, and we will chat a bit.
How about that?
You know, us butchers like
company.
What is the young lady
doing tonight?
The very best I have,
of course!
I'm at your service! I'm at
your service!
Yes! Yes! Since you're
in a hurry,
... then by all means.
For you, of course,
For you, of course,
for you, for you, for you, of course.
For you, of course,
for you, of course.
For you, of course,
for you, of course.
- Turn the record.
- For you, of course...
Oh, what nasty weather!
Oh, that Eastern wind!
Looks like there will be no
summer,
... and I come to think of it,
there wasn't any.
I wouldn't say you look very
healthy either.
- And it is not at all...
- Look who's talking.
... surprising!
I heard something...
... from the man in the
butcher's shop.
Who - from the hair-pin to the
safety-pin,
From the hat down to the shoes...
Is sheer elegance?
They're all crazy about me:
a gray-haired gentlemen
And a young boy.
I come out to the crossing
With a nonchalant air,
... and a 100 buses freeze,
and cars start honking:
Salute to beauty!
Lady, what is your name?
- Mary!
- Lady Mary.
- Mary!
- Lady Mary.
You are perfection itself,
You are perfection itself,
From your smile to your step
You're above all praise.
Oh, what a bliss it is,
Oh, what a bliss it is...
To know you're perfection,
To know, you're an ideal!
- Mary!
- Lady Mary.
- Mary!
- Lady Mary.
Mary!
Who cures angina and colds...
Faster than any mixtures?
And who saves all folks better
than any doctors...
In summer and in winter -
Just with her smile.
Children grow up,
But I will never grow old,
And everyone will remember
me and wait for me to come.
Years will go by, but no one
will forget...
- Mary!
- Lady Mary.
- Mary!
- Lady Mary.
You are sheer perfection,
You are sheer perfection,
From your smile to your step
You're above all praise.
Oh, what a bliss it is,
Oh, what a bliss it is...
To know you're perfection,
To know you're an ideal!
- Mary!
-m Lady Mary.
- Mary!
- Lady Mary.
Mary!
I'm switching off the light.
- Do you often do that?
- Do what?
Do you often jump about like
that?
Jump about?! Would you kindly
explain what you mean?
But we saw it just now!
What?!
- You saw me jump about?
- We did.
How dare you!
For your information, young man
I don't jump about, I dance.
I finished a ballet school on
the Island of Tarabar.
And with excellent marks!
Madam Corry's class.
What a strange fantasy!
"Jump about"!
Good morning, boys!
I hope you had a good night's
sleep?
Now for the musical class.
Switch it on.
It's a good thing you finally
agreed, Banks. My sources,
very reliable sources say, they
will be flying in any time now.
I am happy to use your advice,
admiral.
Begin.
Go ahead!
- What's going on here? Stop!
- Stop!
Good morning, Mrs. Banks. I am
Bob Gudetti from West-Mole Co.
My assistant.
Over my dead body!
On the contrary, we are doing
all in our power to avoid that
... in view of the possible
invasion from outer space.
A quarter-de luxe class shelter
with a phone, a toilet and gas!
Food supplies enough to last
With frugal rationing,
of course.
- On what money, you fool?
- Safety is more important!
Bravo, Banks. You did the
right thing.
Hey, Boom, is this your
plotting?
I'll show you what's what,
you rioter!
- Militarist!
- Sponger!
Today we shall take a sample
of the soil. Launch it!
Stop!
Hey you, foolish scoundrels!
I'll get you underground!
Mister Banks, did you find oil?
I hate to interfere, mister
Banks...
... but I demand that you don't
disrupt our classes.
Are you going to drill an
oil well?
- No, this is different.
- Mind you, mister Banks:
If you drill an oil well
and find oil,
you may join the Organization
of Oil-exporting Countries.
- I'm not afraid of threats!
- What shall we do?
If you ignore considerations
of your family's peace,
... you could at least think
about the environment.
- I'm with you, sister!
- So what do we do then?
- Who has the decisive word?
- You do!
- Drill it here!
- Right here?
- Yes!
- Take that idiot away!
We'll see who wins! What, you
can't do it? Right!
- Good morning.
- Hey!
Oh, it's you, Mary Poppins!
You are just about the only
sensible person in this house.
You don't believe this nonsense
with aliens. Tell them!
I think the earth is cold
today, sir.
So you're in it too!
Hey you! Are you or are you
not with them?
I'm with the children, sir.
And we are going to the park.
I would stand up from the ground
if I were you, mister Hey.
What kind of an example are you
setting to your nephews?
Don't break the rules!
Throw garbage into waist-bins!
- No littering in the park!
- Don't litter with words, sir.
Neley looks so happy today.
And mister Willkins is sitting
on Mary's favorite place.
All right, I will go to the
pavilion.
But mister Willkins, I haven't
finished reading about Bill.
Excuse me.
I beg your pardon, did you say
something?
Of course I did. I wanted to
read it to the end to find out,
... what Astute Bill needed
the master-key for.
Sorry, I can't help you. I
always finish reading at 4...
... to get home in time for tea.
Then maybe you can lend me your
magazine?
Neley, I can tell you
about Bill.
- Really, Jane?
- Yes.
No, I have a coat and boots
on me...
... and the young gentleman
must be very cold.
I will give him my magazine.
Don't worry, mister Willkins.
In a week the series about Bill
will be shown on TV.
Never! I am categorically
against screen versions!
Thank you, mister Willkins.
So this is what water is like!
Cool and light!
People, you are so lucky that
you can walk on the ground!
It is so wonderful, Jane!
I'd say this is absolutely
revolting.
Good day, Mary Poppins.
Who allowed you to come down
here, may I ask?
No one. My legs jumped down on
their own, Mary Poppins.
Well then they'd better
jump up again.
Shame on you! On an odd date,
... when Saturn is hardly seen,
and the Hound Dogs don't bark?
What did they teach you?
Mary Poppins! Please let him
spend some more time with us.
A little more!
He must feel so lonely standing
there with no one to talk to!
Please, Marry Poppins! Please!
Edward! What's with you? What
a ridiculous show?
Get up from the dirty grass!
It is all your influence! You..!
- Plebeian! Half-bred! Monster!
- Calm down, Mrs. Lark.
Ed! Bartholomew!
Bartholomew!
Bartholomew! Wait, Bartholomew!
- Bartholomew!
- Come here!
Bartholomew!
We came out for a walk before
tea. It's such a lovely day!
And the dogs insisted.
My God, what am I seeing?
You heartless mean little boy!
Why torture the poor fish?
Put it back where you caught it
this instant!
I'm afraid It is quite
impossible.
It's too far away.
That doesn't matter. You can't
torture helpless creatures!
I'm going to tell this to the
constable!
Bartholomew, what odd jumps?
- What a scandalous dog!
- You are impossible!
What is he saying?
He says, he won't take that.
He insists that you speak with
him in a polite tone.
I'm going to complain to
the Prime-minister.
Neley, you have 10 minutes.
And then?
Beautiful.
It is live music, isn't it,
Mary Poppins?
Miss Jane, I don't know if
there will be...
... another beautiful day
like today in my life,
but I know for sure, I will
never forgive myself...
if now I don't have the courage
to ask you to a waltz.
I will be honored.
Michael, I ask you as a friend:
please hold my dolphin.
Thank you.
Jane, I don't know how
to dance waltz.
Then why did you ask me?
Well then, let's just walk
a little.
Thank you so much.
- How do you know Mary Poppins?
- She's a friend of my father's.
Who is your father?
Where does he live?
He stands on a cliff over the
sea with a trident and a horn...
and my mother sits next to him
and brushes her hair.
And the seagulls circle
above them,
and cast winged shadows on their
marble bodies.
How beautiful! By why did
you leave them?
I didn't want to. But what can
statues do against people?
How did you get to our
garden?
In a box. We always travel
like that.
They need us in parks,
museums and gardens.
And they buy us and send
us in parcels.
And it doesn't occur to anyone
that we may be lonely.
I love you, Neley.
I want you to stay with
us forever.
I love you too.
But it's impossible, I have to
get back to where I belong.
I understand.
Hey, Mary. How are you feeling?
Hope your back doesn't ache?
Any news?
I'm terribly hungry. Is there
anything yummy...
... for an old friend.
- I didn't hear "thank you".
- Come on, girl!
No time for such ceremonies.
I had meetings all day...
... consultations, negotiations,
discussions.
A lot to decide, a lot to see.
Will you be quiet? Stop
jabbering like a common sparrow.
- You came from there?
- A I have an urgent message.
There are two impossible spoilt
twins in New Zealand.
- When?
- The wind changes at midnight.
Well, I have to be off, my girl.
See you soon.
See you soon, old chatterbox.
The wind will change
at midnight!
Wonderful! Isn't it strange...
... that people don't fly.
I had nothing to do with it,
constable.
I never touched it,
I didn't even come near it!
Nonsense, Smith! The statues
are your responsibility.
And no one else could have
done that.
I never had any luck, since
I was a little boy!
- Listen, constable...
- We are wasting our time!
First I have to look for a
naked boy who mistreats a fish!
Was it a cod?.. What did
Mrs. Lark say?
- A mackerel.
- All the more!
Now they tell me they're missing
their most valuable statue!
You disappointed me.
I relied on you, and you...
This is how you pay me
for my trust in you!
Good gracious!
Smith, why didn't you tell
me in the first place?
A brilliant idea! Now you don't
have to pretend any more!
Ladies and gentlemen, I was
unfair to the poor fellow.
He proved he was not only a
watchman, but an artist as well.
He furnished the statue with
a marble book. Excellent!
It is our duty to encourage the
urge of the young to knowledge.
What about the fish?
You can get rid of it.
Don't be sour, darling.
When we decided to get married,
you told me:
I want either a life of plenty,
or two charming kids.
And you agreed.
Well, now we have both
- a good house and two kids.
What else do you need? What is
it you're chasing after?
Everyone is chasing after
something.
That's what life is all about,
isn't it?
Maybe it's just that everyone
lives wrong?
Everyone can't live wrong.
And we're not any different.
Besides, that is child's talk.
Look at Mary Poppins. She's
always calm and cool.
If she weren't our nanny I'd say
she was perfection herself.
And receiving such a small
salary at that.
I wonder.
What?
I wonder if all this would have
happened, if you weren't here?
And I wonder,
when you stop being interested
in what is none of your concern.
Go to bed now!
I wonder, who I am?
What kind of a question is that?
You are Jane Banks.
And I am Michael Banks.
Is that so, Mary Poppins?
Maybe. How should I know? I'm
not the inquiry office.
Your weapon!
Get under the covers, quick!
What did I say to make her
angry again?
Mind you, sir...
I never get angry. I have
royal patience.
Only you can't shoot at people
from around the corner.
And I am so kind today! What
a pity this day had to end.
- Everything ends sometime.
- Except you.
You won't leave us, will you?
lmagine what a life I will have
if I spend it all on you.
I wonder if mom and dad would
believe us if we told them?
- Told them what?
- Everything.
About Neley, and about Edward,
and Bartholomew.
Only they wouldn't believe us.
And they will never know.
- There was a time when
they knew. - Really?!
You're saying, they knew
everything too?
That Neley is alive, and that
you can fly,
... and understand what dogs
are saying?
Yes, they knew all that and the
language of birds and animals.
In the past.
- Then why did they forget it?
- Because they grew up.
That's sad.
None the less, it is true.
I'm turning off the light.
You are a grown-up too, but you
know it, you haven't forgotten.
Me? I'm not like everyone else.
I m a rare exception. I am
beyond comparison.
I am "Lady Perfection".
All right, a few more minutes,
as an exception.
But on one condition: you will
go to sleep...
... and you will have sweet
dreams.
All that happened many
years ago...
Is stored in our colorful
dreams,
And the magic ring-dance
of those dreams...
Takes grown-ups back into their
childhood.
Dreams, where fairy-tales live
amidst wonders,
Dreams, where you can reach out
and touch the stars,
He, who is a little in his
childhood, is a happy man.
Our childhood is long gone,
the ABC book of our past life
is read to the last page.
Summer, autumn, winter...
Summer, autumn, winter,
And no spring!
But the warmth of that spring,
But the warmth of that spring...
Is cherished in our childish
dreams.
The wonderful country of our
childish dreams...
Everyone needs them when
they grow old.
Only it's sad that when we
grow old...
We don't often see those colorful
dreams.
Dreams, where fairy-tales live
amidst wonders,
Dreams, where you can reach out
and touch the stars,
He, who is a little in his
childhood, is a happy man.
Our childhood is long gone,
the ABC book of our past life
is read to the last page.
Summer, autumn, winter...
Summer, autumn, winter,
And no spring!
But the warmth of that spring,
But the warmth of that spring...
Is cherished in our childish
dreams.
Our childish dreams,
Our childish dreams,
Our childish dreams.
Good evening, Mary Poppins. That
was beautiful singing.
Me?!
I suggest that you wouldn't
forget, I am a decent girl...
and I sing only in the morning!
- Then I must have dreamt it.
I've been wanting to talk to you
all this time, Mary Poppins.
- You're not in a hurry now?
- Indeed I am!
- But it depends on the wind.
- The wind? It is getting cold.
I think it is time that you
moved inside, mister Hey.
Autumn is nearing, tents
catch fire.
I see. So you too think I'm a
useless idler.
On the contrary. I like you,
mister Hey.
You like live music too,
don't you?
- Live music?
- The one you don't turn on.
Oh yes, I see.
However some of your songs
are... how should I put it?
But I hate to see how some folks
live on Cherry Street,
... and I tell about it in
my songs.
Did it ever occur to you,
mister Hey,..
that at times people come to
understand it themselves?
Yes. But what should I do then?
Maybe, It's time I started
doing something indeed?
I have to go too!
Good bye, and don't forget what
I said about your nephews.
Do something! Do something!
Do something! That's it!
Why didn't it ever occur to me?
You are damn right, Mary!
Only how do you do it?
It's a pity you won't see how I
get into this car...
... and dump it in the nearest
ditch, the damned gravedigger!
No, that's not it.
Only he who acts,
accomplishes things!
No, that's not it again.
What a pity you won't see this,
Mary. I think I won't either.
Have they come?
They're here! Pipe all hands
off deck!
Full submersion!
Full submersion! They're here!
They've come, my beauties!
God damn my spleen!
Post 107 reporting a fire at 17,
On Cherry St.! On the double!
I knew it from the beginning,
just like Astute Bill!
Post 107 reporting. There's a
fire at 17, Cherry Street!
Mister Banks found an oil
deposit! Batten down the hatch!
Calm down, the fire brigade
is on it's way.
Do you have buckets, hooks,
fire-extinguishers?
Congratulations, mister Banks!
What luck!
It isn't oil, it's gas.
- Gas?
- Gas?!
That's not so bad, mister Banks.
Gas is even better than oil.
It happens that you go to pick
berries and find a mushroom.
The mushroom - that is gas - is
much better than oil.
You stretch a gas pipeline
across my courtyard...
and join the Organization of
Gas-exporting Countries.
Darling, did I get lucky
at last?
Quiet! Quiet! If they ask,
I was with you.
What is that? A thunderstorm?
- Oh, no. A little fire.
- Hurray!
Quiet, children! We were
playing "hit-ship".
Hurray! Jane, look, our house
is on fire! Hurray!
- Where is Mary Poppins?
- Jane, look...
And where's the piano by "Madam
Corry"? And the camp-bed?
The wind! The wind has changed!
That means.. that means,
she's gone?
She said she would stay until
the wind changed direction.
Thank God you're here!
We were playing "hit-ship".
- Mother, she's gone!
- Who?
Mother, Mary Poppins left us.
To leave at such a crucial
moment? How selfish of her!
I will never accept the
heartless girl back. Never!
- Mother!
- You are so wicked!
Shame on you, children.
I want Mary Poppins, and no
one else in the whole world!
Where is the fire hydrant?
My God, well it isn't in the
nursery!
Look!
Oh!
It's her. It's her portrait.
There's something written there.
It's "Au revoir, Mary Poppins".
- Au revo...
- Hey, what's "Au revoir"?
I think it's in French and I
think it's "Farewell".
No!
It's "good-bye". I'm sure.
It's "good-bye"!
- Then it's all right?
- She will come back!
She always keeps her promise!
- Oh, mister Banks.
- Yes?
There's an urgent telegram
for you.
Here.
Must be congratulations?
So soon?
- Any answer?
- No.
- What about the tip?
- Forget about it!
What a detestable manner...
... to bring bad news on
such a happy day?
Yes...
They haven't come.
I sound off retreat!
