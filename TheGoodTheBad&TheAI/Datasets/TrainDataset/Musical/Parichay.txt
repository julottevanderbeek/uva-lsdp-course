There was once a Colonel
in the Army
Yes, he is that colonel.
But that was the time, when
the British were ruling India
When the British left, The
Colonel left the army...
... but did not leave his
military discipline
People call him now
as Rai Saheb
He lives in a very big
bungalow with his grandchildren
He had a son named Nilesh.
He was iust as stubborn as
his father.
But his likes were very different
from Rai Saheb.
He wanted to be a musician but
Rai Saheb did'nt want this.
He married as per his wish to
Sujata without Raisaheb's consent
Then events which have been
happening for years only...
...happened. Nilesh and Suiata
lived a life of poverty...
...and both of them died
fighting with their poor life
...and left their five children as
orphans without any support
Rama, Aiay, Viiay, Meeta
and Sanju
After 17 years, Rai Saheb
brought back Nilesh's children...
...to the bungalow and tried
a lot to educate them.
But these children also turned
out to be as stubborn as...
...their father and grandfather.
He kept many masters but they
did'nt allow anyone to stay.
Some stayed for months, some
for weeks & some only 10 days
Some left after being fed up
and some...
No, he has not gone and he is
still teaching this children
Silence...-We are silent
and you are only talking
Again you talked back...
Stand up...
What did l do that
you are beating me?
Till now you have not done
anything & this is Ur condition
Think of what your condition
will be, if you do something
l have heard a lot about you and
if l don't set all of you right...
...then you tell me, ok...
Stand up - l'm standing
Keep standing.
Stand up on the chair.
Learn the lesson in geography.
Till then l will teach your
little brother. You understood!
J for Jack and K for...
-l need to do it.
Do what?
-Masterji, l need to do it.
But do what?
-l have to do it
What do you have to do?
-Have to do it?- But what?
l have done it.
-What? you've done it.
Then you are a good student
Sleep, No one is there.
Sleep...
No...
Ghost! Ghost!
What happened to masterii?
-l don't know, sir
He ran saying that there
was a ghost.- See this, brother
Who has done this?
Whose prank is this?
-Who else can it be?
Only those for whom teachers
are appointed every day.
ls it something new brother?
-Go, Call all of them outside.
Aiay....
Vijay....
Meeta.
Sanju....
You don't have to put on an act.
Rai Saheb is calling you all.
You won't get up like this.
Come on, all of you get up.
Come on get up..
All of you...
Sister....Sister....
Rai Saheb is calling you.
Come soon.
l don't understand why you are
behind them.
You are also not less
stubborn, brother
Let them not study
if they don't want to.
You go and sleep, brother.
l will see to them.
Come soon
Stand here.
Where is Rama?
You also come here.
You are the real captain. Can
anything happen without Ur wish
Tell the truth as to who did it.
Who lit the candle on the...
...Tortoise's back?
Answer clearly as to whose
prank is this or...
...l will make you all stand here
for the whole night.
Won't you tell then?
Then keep standing like this
Narain, you also stand here and
see that none of them...
...even try to sit down.
-Ok
But for the whole night -Yes,
they'll stand the whole night
And me also
-Yes, you also will stand
The army has done the mischief
but the drum-beaters...
...get the punishment
There is Saturn's influence on
Monday and hence work is not...
...being done. Then there is
Budh...-Wait, Panditji
You have said the whole week
upside down.
Why don't U start from Monday
-You leave this joking...
...attitude and listen to
the Panditji.
You say in plain Hindi as to
whether he'll get a job or not
Listen youth, l don't like this
joke with palmistry
l am stuck now. He will say the
full horoscope and then only go
What are you thinking? -l was
listening to the second track
What is that?
-Don't you know?
When someone is speaking, there
is also one voice speaking...
...inside you. l call that
as my second track.
The only difference is that my
second track speaks lowder...
...than me -ls it? Then what is
your second track saying now.
lt says that l won't get this iob
-Why not?
The reason is that Panditii won't
Ieave my hand. So l won't...
...be able to go to the interview
and hence l won't get the job.
Job is not in your fate as the
lines of your hand indicate...
...that you will do business.
Your fortune is going to change
When it does, you will
get a royal place
Maharai, l don't get a iob for
...are talking of royal kingdom.
You see Amit's hands. l'll go
Ok, see my hand, Panditii
l don't know English and l need
a person who'll write whatever...
...l say in Hindi in English-Yes
-U should write only what l say
The one who used to work for
us has become very old-Yes,sir
Now he has become an old man
-Yes, sir.
He is not able to see properly
also.
One letter has to be typed
ten times.-Yes sir
Work is not more than
Everyday there will be 10-12
Ietters and once in a month..
...you have to type all the bills
and send it. - Yes sir
Have you understood?
-Yes sir...-Pirachandji
Pirachandii, take him inside and
explain all the work to him
You go with him
-Yes sir
Sit ...
Do you take Beedi?
-No, sir
l keep the letters which come
everyday in the left tray.
The ones for which reply need
not be given, l keep them...
...in this right tray.
Nothing else but the work
becomes systematic
The ones which've to be replied,
keep their copies in those...
...files there. There is a
separate file for every year
l have kept them properly
& you won't have any problem
l got this almirah made as per
my order and Sethji did...
...not say anything at all.
He is a very nice person
He has really taken very
good care of me
How long have you been
working here?
Last month, l have completed
Whatever l required, l
immediately ask Sethji...
He has never said no to me
He gave Rs. 500 for my...
...son's marriage not as a
Ioan but just like that.
l have worked for many years
now and l have become old now
And l am not able
to complete the work, son
Sethii incurs a loss
due to me then.
l've only told Sethii and he
has not dismissed me.
He did not remove me.
My glasses... l'll iust come
You did a good thing, but what
is the use?
Both of you have lost the iobs.
Is that old man going to...
...remain there? If not today, Seth
is going to remove him tomorrow
Let him dismiss him. My heart did'nt
agree and so l came off
There is a post-card from
your uncle's place -When?
ln the morning -What has he
written?-You only read it.
lt is about the house
and about a job
What is your opinion?
-What do you say?
l feel that, you do this
job for the time being
Regarding that Dixit, l'm sure U
will get that job in 5-6 months
And l am here only and will
inform you.
Now U do this iob in the village
and also solve that house issue
Another love letter has come
-What is it?-Where is it?
Notice.. Send rent within 10 days
or you've to vacate this lodge
ls this any life? l will go home
and send money from there
Come on. Some way will
come from somewhere. Is'nt it?
l am a wanderer, friends,
l have no house
or no place to live
l am a wanderer, friends,
l have no house
or no place to live
l have to keep going
l iust have to keep going
l am a wanderer, friends,
l have no house
or no place to live

l iust have to keep going
lf one way stopped,
another one joined with it
l also turned with it as
the path also turned
lf one way stopped,
another one joined with it
l also turned with it as
the path also turned
My house exists on
the wings of the air
l am a wanderer, friends
l have no house
or no place to live
l have to keep going
l just have to keep going
The days caught my hand
and made me sit here
The night gave a sign and
called me elsewhere
The days caught my hand
and made me sit here
The night gave a sign and
called me elsewhere
This is my story
from morning to evening
l am a wanderer, friends

l just have to keep going
See, it spreads as
much as it eats.
Hello, Aunty
Ravi...
-May you live long
Are you listening? You have
grown a moustache and now...
...you are looking very big
He used to be half deaf before
and now when l call, he can't...
...hear even when l shout loudly.
See, who has come.
Ravi, you have really come
-How did you come suddenly?
You did'nt write or inform.
-l had written a letter
l did not know that, as he
never tells me anything
l wrote a letter but did not think
that he will really come
l had written many letters
earlier also, but did he come.
Uncle, the search for a iob in
the city does not give...
...us any free time at all
-But you had written that...
...you were working for
an Iron factory- Yes
But there was a strike and
l lost the job- This is bad
l will iust come - What do you
have to do with the strike?
This politics suits only two
kinds of people
One who has no worry of food
& another who has nothing to...
...eat in his house. Tell me, have
you got the other job.
No, but there is hope that l will
get the job in 6-8 months
Then, till that time, you do this
job. Small amounts of...
...Rs. 400-500 does not make any
difference to Rai Saheb
He iust wants that his grand
children should study
Have you called him to send him
to those dangerous children.
Don't you dare to send
him to that Bungalow?
Are Rai Saheb's grand children
so dangerous?
Not dangerous, they are the
messengers of death, son
God knows, what all she hears
-l hear everything correctly
l am not deaf like you. Kranti's
mother has told me everything
But what did they do?
-What to say, son?
Dozens of masters have come
there but nobody stays
ln the last master's bed, who
came from Delhi, those...
...children had thrown such a
big snake that he ran...
Don't make it so big, it was not
a snake but a tortoise.
Let it be. One was from Banares
who ran away overnight.
He must have been from Bareili
and not Banares
Whatever it is, he ran away?
Listen Ravi, after listening to
your aunty, if your mind does'nt...
...accept, don't take up the iob
Go and meet Rai Saheb once.
lf he likes you, he might take
you in his business.
Lines of your hand show
that you will go in business
You will get a royal kingdom
when your good time comes.
Unnecessarily you scared him.
Was Ravi any less naughty...
...in his childhood. He had tied a
frog in your hair and...
...you danced like anything.
l had also beaten him a lot.
Come and eat now.
Greetings, Panditii
-Has Rai Saheb come down?
Yes- Come Ravi- Is this the
new master? - Yes
Just say yes to anything he
says. Don't get scared at all
May l come in?
-Come, Panditji
This's Ravi, my nephew.He came
soon after he got my letter
Please sit...
How much have you studied?
-l did BA, and wanted to do MA
l did'nt ask you what you wanted
to study.
What have you studied?
-BA
His face has no smile
at all
ln what subiect have you done
your BA?- In Economics, as l...
l did'nt ask you for the reason.
One who answers without any...
...reason is often lying
This fellow is a demon
he is running to eat
What were you doing in the city?
-Nothing
Then how were you managing?
-lt was a problem now-a-days
What were you doing before
that?-l used to take tuitions
Which class?- From 1st to 10th
-How much were you earning?
Enough to survive -Were your
students scared of you?
No - Then - They used
to love me.
But if the children are rogues...
-Children are never rogues
They might be naughty and
do pranks
Can you correct them if they
are naughty?
l can try my best
-Will you run away?
l won't run without informing
you. l can tell you this much
Can you stay in this bungalow,
if you get a place?
Yes, uncle has already told me
Your uncle must've also told U
that there is strict disciple here
Can you accept the rules and
stay here?
l don't know the rules here.
Then how can l say whether...
...l will stay or not.
What'll you've? Tea or iuice.
-Nothing, Come Ravi
Panditii, you sit here
Let this iob go to hell
The way he talks...
A hole has come
in these shoes.
l felt proud when the Rai Saheb
said that he has never seen...
...a master like this before and
fixed the salary immediately.
Lodging and boarding expenses
are separate from that.
l was scared in the beginning but
Ravi also answered so abruptly...
...that it was fun- Yes, you will
get lots of comfort by sending...
...Ravi to those demon like
children.
l will see to you if something
happens to him
You talk as if l am sending him
to war - What else then?
The soldiers have guns in their
hands. What're U giving him?
Aunty, why're you so scared?
They are only children and...
...what can they do? It is also
bad that someone stops...
...teaching children by getting
scared. Let us see who is...
...more clever. If they are
monkeys, then l am also...
What has happened to your
shoes?-Yes, what happened?
Coal fell on it and that part
was thrown away
Then why should you wear it?
You should have taken a new one
You come with me tomorrow. We
will get new shoes and clothes
The new shoes have to be oiled
-What? -Come, Masterji
lf you want anything, your press
that buzzer. l will hear the...
...bell and l will come. You sit
and l will inform our sir.
Do you need any tea or tiffin
-No, l don't want anything
Tell us, what do you want?
l was iust seeing, who stays
where?
Next time, you knock the door
before coming into anyone's room
She also looks like
the queen of Jhansi.
l'm sorry. l will take
care from next time.
Masterii... Have you been
beaten as soon as you came?
Are your legs and hands alright?
Hope you are not hurt - No...
All these are those children's
pranks. l will just tell madam.
She will hit them with the hunter
that they will learn the lesson
Listen, no need to say anything
to anyone.
No, you keep them under control
now itself...
...or they will even take
your moustache from your face
What? -Sorry, l iust went on
talking without speaking
What is your name?- l'm Narain
and my father's name is...
Leave your father...-Yes, what
is the use of the father now?
How long have you been working
here?
From the age of 14 years, l
have been serving sir
l forgot that sir is calling
you downstairs in the hall
You go and l will come.
May l come in?
-Yes, come in
Sit...
Be prepared, son
They were iust children. He is
their father's father.
Have l been entangled into
this problem unnecessarily?
Have you seen the room?
-Yes - Is it okay? - Yes
lf you want anything,
tell Narain.
l have called them so that l can
introduce you to your students
Here the whole group
is spoiled
Where is Rama?
Where is Rama?
Rama is the eldest. When she
was studying Metric,...
...her studies were interrupted.
This is Aiay, he was in 5th
or 6th class.
He fought with the master in the
school and ran off...
...And now he has left
the studies.
Their parents never tried to send
him to school again.
The younger one is Viiay, then
Munni whose name is Meeta...
...and that is Saniay
These children have not gone to
school at all in a way.
Last year, whatever the dozen
masters who came here ...
...could teach them, they
have taught them.
Rest is on you now. Teach them
as much as you can.
Brother, did you see this?
-What is this?
The leg of the chair which
was in the master's room.
These naughty children have
broken it
Masterii sat on the chair and
then fell down.
No, l did'nt fall, as l did not
sit at all.
Why are U telling excuses? See the
injury you got on your forehead...
...when you fell - This one. l got
hurt with the nail in the Tonga
Shakti, you go and don't argue
mOre
You people also go and keep
your books & notebooks ready
The new master will
teach you. You go now..
l will also go, sir
Did your uncle say anything to
U as to who these children are?
Yes, he was saying that they are
the children of Ur son Nilesh Rai
He also told me the condition in
which they were brought here
Then, no need to say anything
else to you.
l iust want to say that you don't
get carried away by their ...
...faces. All of them are very
naughty.
lf you deal with them, you will
feel that l have got some...
...animals from the zoo. None of
them show any attribute to...
...become a human
l know they have been brought
up in great poverty.
But that does not mean they
should lack the basic discipline
lf they could not learn from their
father, they could have learnt...
...some behaviour from
neighbours.
But it seems that these children
have taken a oath not to...
...learn anything at all
The one good thing about these
children is their unity
lf you punish one, all of them
go on a hunger strike
Rama is the eldest of them
of all but has the most...
...fighting nature & stubborn.
She is very short-tempered
She can't tolerate Sati even
for a moment and me...
She thinks that l am her
father's killer.
She thinks, l did'nt bother about
Nilesh deliberately but...
...l actually waited for him
always thinking that he may..
Ravi, l don't know why l hope
that U can correct these children
Till now, no teacher has taken
these children's side.
You got hurt as you fell from the
chair but said U got hurt in tonga
Ravi, there won't be any bigger
favour for me than...
...making these children into
human beings.
l will try my best to teach them
and advise them.
Children seem to be intelligent
but they are only stubborn
lf these children come to the
right way, you will be surely...
...very proud of them
in future.
You won't worry about these
children now.
Leave them to me. l believe that
l will be able to control them.
Shall l go then? Let me
prepare for my work.
What happened, Masterii?
Don't you know that it is
forbidden to laugh here...
...as your salary will be cut
-What?
Yes, every month 10-15 rupees
are cut from my salary.
Hence, l run towards the iungle
whenever l feel like laughing.
Mad fellow, when you want to
Iaugh, have a hearty laugh
l will give you your salary.
Who was laughing so loudly
now? - Masterji
He told me to laugh too.
l ran away.
You all do very good drawing.
But one thing is extra here
l won't need this.
You must all be having
your note-books and books
Do like this. Close your
books and note-books
l will neither teach you
nor you will study.
We will iust talk.
Ok.
He is telling lies.
He will surely teach us
Let me learn your names
first.
You are Aiay, you're Viiay,
you're Meeta and you're Sanjay
Did l say correctly?
ls'nt it? Answer me.
-That old man told you that
No, Meetaii, you should not
call him like that
He is an old man as his
moustache is also white
No, Saniu Babu. Do you know
who he is to you?
Aiay, do you know what
is his relation with you?
He is my pop's pop?
-Correct, absolutely right
Did you call your father
as pop?
No.. as Babuii
How did your Babuii
call his father? - Babuji
That is good. That means he
is your Babuji's Babuji.
Then who is he to you?
-Our grandfather
lf both their photos are kept
before you, how will you...
... say whose photos are they?
-One is Babuji's
Good, another one..
-His pop's
Don't you all feel hot?
You have not put the fan.
l am dead.
It is already 9 O' clock
Good evening, everybody
Shut up.
What happened?
What happened to you?-To me!
- Wash your face & come
What do you mean? -Don't you
have a mirror in your room?
No, master. You keep them under
control from now itself or...
...they will even snatch
your moustache
lt is better that you only remove
your moustache or it will...
...go some day.
Now why are you standing
and thinking something.
Nothing, l was listening
to my second track.
Second track
-ldiot...
This is children's work.
Where should l wash my face.
Who has done this?
Won't you tell? You tell or else
l will beat each one of you.
l will also see. Saniu, tell
me who did this.
Tell me quickly
who did this
Leave him, as such a small child
can't be so naughty.
Then who did this prank.
-l did this, punish me now
Sati, why are you also becoming
shamelsss along with her?
Go away. You won't get any
_ood.
lf you stay hungry, you
will come to your senses
You eat your food
Narain...- Yes, masterii
Come in...
Who has kept this here?
-l have kept it- Why?
The elder madam told me to
keep this.
Go and give this to her and tell
her that l don't teach children...
...with sticks. Go now
Saniu, come here.
Come here, son.
Why are you looking here and
there?
When l am calling,
you come here.
Get your books with you
Show me.
Where are the starting pages?
-l had already studied them
Then you tore them. -Will you
read the rest or not - No
Ok, l will teach you whenever
you feel like. Go and sit
Go and sit, son
What is this?
-Won't you beat me?
Masteriii, why have you sent this
stick to me -As it is yours...
lt is mine, but you don't know
why l've kept it in the classroom
l know it.
What does this mean? -lt
means, it is my responsibility...
...to teach the children and not
yours.
l wish that you don't interfere
in my work.
l don't want to listen to what
you want or you don't want.
l had kept this stick in this
room and it will stay here
Sati Devi, you are surely
educated but you also need...
...to learn behaviour and
discipline just like these...
Masterii...
lt is disrespectful for you to
come inside this class-room...
...without permission, when
the master is present.
You might not have learnt
this anywhere.
Sati, Ravi is right.
You come out.
Aiay, what did the teacher
before me teach you?
Geography -What did you read
in Geography?
Who is eating here?
Saniubaba, what are you eating.
Won't you give it to me.
Atleast show me what you
are eating.
Why did you throw his toast?
He won't eat & no one will eat
anything till sister eats food
Has'nt your sister eaten anything
from yesterday.
l also did not eat.
Don't get scared. We all will sit
and eat together.- And sister...
She will also eat.
Sister won't eat. -lf she does
not eat, l also won't eat.
l will also go on hunger strike
with all of you. Is it ok?
You all study, l will iust come
May l come in?
Come
You also left the class and came
for complaining about children
Not against the children
l have come to complain...
...against you to yourself only.
l don't think these children need
a teacher.
You have called me
unnecessarily
Meaning !- These children don't
need education but need...
...love and sympathy which can't
be given by you or Sati Devi
lf love can be made into a tablet
and given, l would have given it
But the difficulty is that we
don't get tablets for love...
...which l can give to these
children.
l brought them here from those
huts and tried to give them...
...all comforts and facilities and
tried to make them more human.
Have l done all this because
l don't love them?
You are calling comforts and
facilities as love but...
...these things can be got by any
patient in any hospital.
You have given facilities of live
but not motherly love
You are fulfilling their necessities
but only the parents can...
...give the love they need
They don't have to see the
children's qualities for that
What do you mean to say?
Yesterday night you had punished
Rama & did'nt give her food
The children also went without
food due to that.
Have you ever tried to pacify
them even once?
Many times, Ravi. l know that
the parents who punish also...
...give love to the children but
the stubbornness and insolence...
...of these children is...
You have been kept for this only.
If you can teach and advice...
...these children, you stay.
Or you can also go.
Who is it?
You - Can l come inside
-Come in
Sit - l have come to
ask you something.
Do you know why l have
been called here?
Yes, we have all come from the
zoo and hence you have been...
...called to teach the animals the
way to live in a palace.
You are angry, Rama and hence
-You address me with respect
l am not your student
l know and have heard that you
don't want to study.
But l had come to ask you
something else. - Ask me?
l heard that many masters came
here before me and all ran away
Or were made to run. If you
think that l should also run...
...you tell me so that l will
myself go away.
l neither called you nor will l
tell you to go.
You ask this question to
Rai Saheb.
l had come to ask you because
the children for whom l...
...was called, their responsibility
lies more with you than Rai Saheb
Nobody needs to be taught here.
The fight is in the family...
...and not for children's education.
l am going away, but your young
sisters and brothers are...
...so lovable that l thought l'll
tell you this before going.
lf Rai Saheb is doing wrong,
U're also not doing anything good
Rai Saheb lost his son in
his stubbornness
But if something happens to any
of these children due to your...
...stubbornness, you will be
responsibile for that and not...
...Rai Saheb-Why are you giving
me so much advice?
The reason is that you can stay
without food even for ten days.
But small Saniu and Neeta...
how long will they stay hungry
Even if Rai Saheb bends before
you for the sake of the...
...children, don't think that
you will become big.
You will be proved much
smaller than him.
l will speak with Rai Saheb
and go away tonight.
But if another master comes,
instead of driving him away...
...make him your friend and be
patient till these children ...
...study & become eligible for
going to any hostel.
Otherwise, you think yourself
as to what will happen to...
...these children.
Caught you - Are you here or
gone away?- Why?
Sister asked me to see
and come.-Wait...
What are you doing,
masterji?
lf you are caught singing,
you will be killed
Don't get into this habit
at all.
What is wrong in singing?-That
is the root of this problem
l would say, you go towards the
jungle, if you feel like singing
Why should l go to the
jungle for singing?
You also won't stay long as you
have all the bad habits.
You suddenly start singing
or laughing
Come here and sit
Sit...
Tell me why Rai Saheb
is so annoyed with music.
What you are talking?
Have'nt you heard that...
...the one bit by a snake is
scared even of the rope.
How can music be a poison
of which Rai Saheb is scared?
lt has become a poison
for his life.
Are you talking about Nilesh?
Did he used to sing very well?
He was extremely good.
Our Diwan sir has heard...
...him over the radio too.
But there is one thing, Masterji
This music is also the work
of saints. Our younger master...
...concentrated only on music
always for all 24 hours.
When he used to sing in the
early morning, it used to...
...feel as if he is waking
up the Goddess of a temple.
l used to feel the fragrance of
incense sticks in his songs.
The tree in the garden..
-_ es
Sometimes he used to sit below
that tree to sing & sometimes...
...in the terrace and used to be
Iost for hours
My beloved...My beloved...
My dear, you are talking
like honey
Your lovely black eyes,
my dear...
...are talking like honey
The thirsty are still
yearning...
...though it has been
raining for years.
The thirsty are still
yearning.
You, from when are you standing
here -For a long time, sir
Lime water...
Has father got up?
-Long back, he has told...
...you to get ready by
Don't you have to go to
Choudhry's place who...
...had come the other day
with his daughter?
But l have to go to the city
today. What will l do there?
All these visits are happening
only for your sake- For me!
Sir, they are very wealthy people
-May be they are
Will they give their wealth to me?
-Shall l tell something?
l really liked that girl.
Then do one thing.
You only marry her.
l will search for someone
else for myself
Jokes apart, you tell your father
and fix the alliance.
Leave it, Narayan. Who'll get
stuck in marriage? Take his
The thirsty are still yearning...
...though it has been raining
_or years.
Your eyes are sparkling
Father, l will sing for the first
time with my teacher in...
...the conference - Did'nt Narain
tell you anything in the morning?
What? - Did'nt he tell you to
be ready by 10 O'clock as...
..you have to come with me to
Mr. Choudhary's house
But l have to go to the city
today by 11 :30 train, father
For going to sing there
-Yes, father
ls your singing more important
than going to Choudhry's place
But Father -No one in our family
has ever answered so...
...disrespectfully to his
father before.
You can't come with me because
you have to sing.
l'm singing in a music conference
& the tickets have been sold.
And you will get money for it.
Is'nt it? How much will you get?
Will you get enough money to
buy a coffin for your father?
Did l send you to the hostel to
study or that you learn music...
...and sing Qawwali and make
this bungalow into a brothel.
Seeing your love for music, l
thought U've developed this...
...taste of a rich man. l did'nt
know, you planned to earn ...
...through singing. The place,
where a lady is asked to sing..
...will you sit there and
sing now.
You are thinking wrong. Ustad
Shivnath is a very great musician...
...of India - Your teacher. l'm
going to Choudhary's place now
Maybe you are not aware that
talks of your marriage with his...
...daughter are going on. You also
reach Mr.Choudhary's place with..
...your car. Did you understand?
He was as stubborn as his
father is.
He did'nt go to Mr. Chowdhary's
place.
He wrote a letter and gave me
and went to the city.
First time, l saw a father's
heart breaking
l did'nt like it. Sir used to sit on
the dining table alone every...
...day and used to get up alone
The young master studied for
another year in the city and...
...when he returned one day,
then...
May you live long !
May you live long, daughter!
Your daughter-in-law, father.
Some event occurred in the...
...city suddenly that l had to
marry and then only come back
First we thought, we will call
you there or come here and...
...get married but..
-But what..
You were scared l might not
accept the daughter-in-law
Son, a father is happy only when
his son is happy.
Your mother is not there,
who can complete the...
...traditions of welcoming the
bride. If l had known, l...
...would have definitely arranged
for Shahnai.
But what to do. You people did
not take me in at all.
Take daughter-in-law upstairs.
lt is 9 O'clock and still
father has not come
This is the first time that father
has been late after l've been born.
Maybe he was late before that.
l am not aware of it
Or he is so punctual that l can
give key to my watch.
Spinach vegetable... Father
likes it a lot. Where is he?
Sir is not well. He told you to
eat and then called you to...
...the hall.- If he is not well
why is'nt he in his room.
l don't know, as he did not
say anything
Listen, is Father upset because
of me.
No, if he gets upset, it won't
be due to you...
...but because of me.
Come, Nilesh. Did you have
food? - Yes
Did daughter-in-law eat?
-Yes she also ate.
l heard that you are not well.
Nothing like that but iust
a feeling... Sit.
l am very sorry that l married
like this without your permission
Hence...- Your marriage should
be held as per your wish only
l know Suiata for quite some
time, father.
She is the daughter of
our music teacher
My teacher suddenly died and l
had to marry urgently but..
...l wished to marry
with your permission.
Every man has this right to
make his life in his own...
...way and live as he wishes
like the way l live
l never caught hold of anyone's
hand for support
l am happy that my son has
grown so big today that...
...he does not need my support
any more
You make your own house where
you can live as you wish...
...like l have made my house
and live as per my rules
l don't allow any second person's
wish to be carried out here
Yes, there are some duties
between a father and a son
You will also fulfil your duties
and l will also do the same
l have taken out these 50000
rupees for you.
You start your life with this
money in your own way...
...where there won't be any
interference from my side.
lf you feel this is less, the
Iocker is open.
You take any amount you want.
It's not necessary to ask me.
That was the last meeting
between father and son
They never met each other
after that and...
...never enquired about
each other
Seventeen years passed,
Masterji and...
...one day, when Sir returned
from the city, there was...
...one letter from young master
amongst his other letters.
He read it & went out way he
came in and when he returned...
...after 3 days, he came with
all the children and...
...what to say about the poor
condition of the children then.
Sir did take care of all of them.
But Ramadidi's anger is also...
...ancestral & much more than
her grandfather's.
One night, she was going out
with all the children.
But sir caught all of them and
brought them into the house.
He called Satidevi from the city
and all of them are forbidden...
...to go out of the house.
Nobody can go out of the bridge.
Music & laughter is banned
in this house from then.
Young master's room has been
Iocked and no one can go in.
But these children are such a
nuisance that inspite of all...
...this discipline, they are
not ready to reform.
So many masters have come and
gone. The last master ran...
...away at night in his lungi
only without his other clothes
Now l only wear his clothes...
Narain, you won't get my
clothes & l'll take them along
Your case is different
-Why?
Your clothes will be sent
to your uncle.- Is that so?
l will go now as it is very late.
l have to wake up early...
...as sir is going to the city
tomorrow.-Why?
He goes often for his business.
Satidevi is also going. - Why?
Her house is there only. She
has to take care of her house
l will go now- Ok
Diwanii, have you kept all the
important papers -Yes
Ravi, l may return from the city
in a week or it might take...
...10-15 days. Sati is coming
with me. She has her own house.
l had called her to look after
the children here.
How long can she stay here?
You can understand the big
responsibility l'm giving to...
...to you and going
Yes, l can understand the exam
you are leaving me to write.
Hope you won't be disappointed.
-l also hope for that.
l should not hear that on
returning, that U've run away.
And ask Diwanii if you have any
requirement as l have told him
You won't have any problem
for anything
You will get whatever
you want.
l will go now as it is time
for my class
Diwanii, keep the things in the
vehicle. -Yes - Come Sati
Masterii - Come in, Diwanii
-What is it?
Don't the children have class
today?- No
l have given holiday to the
children today.
Soon after Rai Saheb has left.
-Yes
l have written some book names
here. Please get them.
Also get a carrom set and
things for playing cricket
What are you saying?
-l've written what l'm saying
But if Rai Saheb comes
then...
U show him this paper & say
that l had asked for these.
l don't understand, what
you are doing -Nothing...
You get these things
before tomorrow morning.
You, masterii, where are
your students?
l have given them leave today
-l'm saved -Why?
lf they come, l am dead. l have
to clean this room without...
...their knowledge.
-Whose room is this?
Young master's -Nilesh's
-Yes - Open it, l want to see
No, if someone comes it will
be a problem.
Don't worry, l will close it
afterwards.
lf something happens, you
take care. l don't know anything
When did you all come?
You play the Sitar very well.
-Sister plays it better than you
ls it so? Tell your sister to
play it for me.
First time, l have heard music in
this house.
Are'nt you scared of
grandfather?
But old man is not there...
Not old man but grandfather.
How many times have l told U?
Wicked man -Saniu, where did
you learn this abuse?
From the watchman...
Where did you all go today
Ieaving the classroom?
Did'nt they come to class today
to study?
Grandfather went to the city and
hence we went to play.
Then, why did'nt you tell me that
you are going to play.
What did you play?
-Gilli-Danda
lnside the house! If any glass
had broken, then...
Your window glass is already
broken.
Very bad. If you want to play,
you should go outside to play
Nobody allows us to go.
Come, l will take you outside
-Will you take us out?
Definitely, why not?
-lf you don't come, then see...
Let us go. -You also come,
sister- No, you all go.
No way, nobody will go that way
-You also come, sister
Everyone went out to
sing with the ga ma
Father is not there, but
they've a sister like a queen...
...everyone is with the sister
You all also sing
Not like this, sing
with the words
All of us went out singing...
Father is not there.
We went with our sister who
is like the queen
The morning rises with sa
and removes the darkness
Then the rays of the sun gave
Iots if light with re
The morning rises with sa
and removes the darkness
Then the rays of the sun gave
Iots if light with re
You also sing, Rama
Everyone went on singing on
the bright rays of the sun
From the ga & ma, come
our tune and the song which...
...moves everything and a prayer
has come with pa
Do you know what
l am singing?
Can't l understand even
this much?
You were teaching them
sargam
l was not teaching you as you
must've learnt from Ur father.
Then till what did we reach?
-Till Pancham - How?
Sing it...
From the ga & ma, come
our tune and the song which...
...moves everything and a prayer
has come with pa
We all sang like the bee
on a flower
The sun is pleasant with
dha...
...and sky looks blue &
intoxicating
The sargam  has
been completed.
What is ahead now?
The companions of sargam
went on singing in tune
Father is not there and everyone
is with the queen-like sister
We went on singing...
You have got this new habit of
eating on the table.
The British have gone but have
Ieft his table for you.
They have left me for you.
If they had taken me...
...you would have kept on
waiting for me.
Don't know who has come now
Wait, l am coming.
Ravi, have you forgotten
your aunty?
l could'nt come for so many days
but have brought my whole...
...school with me.
This is Rama. Fall at Aunty's
feet - Salutations...
May you live long, daughter
Come inside.
Aunty, bless me- May U live
Iong. U're also falling at feet
All of you come in.
Hey, bhai...
What happened?
-Uncle is calling aunty as...
...bhai . How can ladies
be brothers?
Yes, she is my sister only. See
how our faces match each other
ls'nt it? Tell us what all are
matching in our faces.
The hair of both of you is white
-You don't have hair
Come in. They are
very naughty.
Sit here, daughter
Who plays that Sitar?
-He can't even hear...
...properly, what he will
play the Sitar.
l used to play that Sitar.
Ravi, l will make arrangements
for their food.
They must be hungry
-We ate and came
When did we eat?
l am feeling hungry
l will make food then
-Let us eat then.
Where are you getting up?
l have to make the food
l will iust come.
When is Rai Saheb coming?
-ln 5-6 days.
But how did you know that he
has gone out of the city?
l could understand that after
seeing these children here
Uncle, you were unnecessarily
spoiling the name of these...
...children.-Did l say it? Your
aunty was only against them.
They are such cute children
that...
Very lovely children, they
never trouble any time
Rama, what are you
doing here?
What is Rama doing
there?
No, daughter, l will make
the food just now
What is it, aunty?- You
only advise her
You think that l don't know how
to make food
When father was there, l used
to make the food for the entire...
...family. There were no servants
in our house.
You only tell her-l can only say
that both of you leave it.
l will only knead the flour
You have come with the shoes
into the kitchen
You also seem to be a Brahmin
like my aunty
You go and sit inside.
Did you see, aunty? She came
for fire & took over the kitchen
From my side, let her take
control of the whole house
Catch me, Saniu
Tell me, Diwanii. Is there any
news from Rai Saheb?
What is it? You are looking
upset?
You are not doing the right thing,
Masterji. -What?
Taking out these children
every day.
So what? The children eat every
day, sleep well and also study.
lf they go out to play everyday,
what is the objection to that?
You know the obiection. How
will you answer Rai Saheb...
...when he comes back.
-Tell me one thing, Diwanji
Have you ever seen these
children so happy before?
You won't know this. If you're
in my place, you will know that...
...these children would never have
studied so sincerely before
The books you had got for them
from the market, these...
...children had read those books
Iong back from their sister.
They used to trouble their
masters in their stubbornness
Are'nt these the same children
who harassed their masters?
They used to drive them away in
a few days.
Do you feel the same thing
by looking at them now?
l am not asking about the
children but for Rai Saheb.
l have been appointed here for
the children & not for Rai Saheb
Sir, it is only 5 minutes to 9.
You are going to be late for...
...food today.
How can l become late?
l have come now
Shame! Shame! You've not
washed your face
Still 3 minutes are left. l'll wash
my face in 2 minutes & come
When it was late night,
the barber and that painter...
...both of them entered the lame
spirit's house and sat inside.
When the lame spirit came back,
he saw that the door was closed
He said from outside who is
inside?
The barber understood and asked
who is outside?
l am the lame spirit
l am a spirit and l will
eat you up.
l am the messenger of death
and l will eat you.
She is scared, Masterii
What happened then, sir?
-The spirit asked him..
...what is his sign -The barber
threw out his razor and said...
...that see my nails.
The lame spirit thought if...
...his nails are so big,
he must also be a big spirit
When no reply came from
outside, the barber threw out...
...a rope outside and said
See my hair?
The spirit was amazed.
When there was no reply...
...from outside, he told the spirit
to run away or said he'll spit.
The the barber took the painter's
limestone and threw it outside
Then spirit ran away saying
Please save me
Tell us another story.-Will you
listen to another story?
Not about the ghosts, sir
l will tell the story of Baiiu
and Tansen.
Tell us that, sir
You must have heard that Tansen
was one of the Navratnas
...of Akbar's Assembly. In his
period, he was a great singer.
One day, another singer called
Baiju came in Akbar's assembly
He said that he will compete
with Tansen.
The whole assembly gathered
Then in a garden two seats of
marble were put and on one...
...Tansen sat and on another
Baiju sat.
Now Tansen started singing.
As soon as he started...
...singing all the birds nearby
gathered there
Tansen took out golden
chains from his pocket and...
...put it in the necks of
all deers.
As soon as the song finished,
all the deers ran away.
Then Tansen told Baiiu you get
all my chains back now
Baiiu started singing
As soon as he started singing,
all the birds which had gone...
...came back. Baiiu removed the
golden chains from their necks...
...while singing and gave it
back to Tansen.
Now it was Baiiu's chance.
He sang a Rag in such a...
...way that the marble on which
he was sitting started melting
Baiiu went on singing and the
marble went on melting...
...so much that Baiiu was
getting stuck in that.
Seeing that, all the people
started shouting, and Baiju's...
...concentration was broken and
he stopped singing.
As soon as he did that, the
marble joined again and Baiju...
...was stuck there. He told
Tansen to sing and remove him...
...from there. Tansen was
scared.
All of them have slept.
Did Tansen take out Baiiu
afterwards?
l will tell the rest of the
story tomorrow.
lt is very late.
You also go and sleep
Listen...
-Did you say something?
Do you address me with
respect as l had told you with...
...anger that day
-lt is good to show respect
No, you don't address me with
respect now.
Then how do l call you?
-l already said that
Ok, then... good night
-Good night...
Who is inside?
Who is there inside?
Who is there outside?
l am the lame spirit.
What is this lame spirit doing
here in the morning?
How is your hand?
-lt is ok. Why?
Sister has sent this balm
and told you to massage with it
Go and thank your sister
from my side
You are laughing so loudly.
What if your salary is cut?
You have done great magic.
Now the children study...
...play and also laugh. No
one needs to go to the jungle
But what will happen when
the Rai Saheb comes back.
Yes, what will happen?
But there is one thing, masterji
Sir is not a bad man but
he is very strict.
He has left the army but
not the army life
Was Rai Saheb like this, even
before Nilesh left the house?
No, he was strict but he used
to joke around also then.
That is it. He has taken that
sorrow into his heart.
l have not seen Rai Saheb
Iaughing for last 20 years.
Narain, by God's wish, you will
see him laughing this time.
Yes, you iust return sir's
Iaughter to him.
l will give you whatever
you want...
What status do l have? But if
you ask for my life also...
Now you'll take the white coins
& you'll take the black coins. Ok
No, l will take the red one.
-No, you'll take the black coins
Come on, play
You are cheating
Very bad...
Let us see who takes the
queen now.
Give it here
Strike - Very good...
You all play, l will go. You
should go to bed after 1 hour
And no one will cheat during
play. Ok, Sanju. Play now
What happened, Rama?
-lnsect...
Where?- It was sitting here.
-Nothing is here
lt was there. It was harassing
me for half-an-hour
Who? - The insect..
lt was really there.
Black one... See there
Rama, you are mad.
Really mad...
Come, dear insect...
lt looks as if you were getting
rid of a lion
Narain...- Come, Panditii
-Where is Ravi?
He is teaching children
in the classroom.
He must be coming in another
five minutes. Please sit.
Forgive me, Panditii, let me finish
my work -Ok, do it.
When is Rai Saheb coming back?
- In another 4-5 days...
He has written a letter to
Diwanji, in which he has written..
...that he will come on the 25th.
-Today is only 15th.
Still 10 more days are left.
-That will run away this...
...week only as time runs
very fast
Greetings uncle
-Greetings
ls the class over?
-Yes, we have the carrom...
...class after half-an-hour.
-ls that so?
Do you have classes for Carrom
also?- Go now, children
Tell me, how you came, uncle.
-You got a letter
Whose letter is it?
-Amit's
What has he written?
-l have got that job, uncle
l have to ioin duty within
two days.
Where?- A nice company and the
job is also very good.
l had given the interview before
coming. This is Mr. Dixit's help
When do you have to reach?
-On the 18th
That means after two days
-_ es
How will you go so early?
What will happen here?
That is the problem as Rai
Saheb is also not there...
And what will happen to
the children
But it won't be good to lose
this job, uncle
How long will l have work here?
Children won't be home for long
They also have to be sent
to school.
That is right but l feel,
you should not decide before...
...Rai Saheb comes.
l will go then as l have to
go to Mr. Gani's house too
Come someday to the house
with Rama as your aunty...
...was asking about her.
The nights are not
being spent easily...
...these nights are filled
with separation
What happened? Sing
without stopping...
l can't sing before you
-Why?
l am not so out of tune that l
can't appreciate a good song.
No, l only sing out of
tune...
But it does not seem like that
on hearing
Who is your teacher?
-My father
Father is the teacher.
Let us see what you're singing
This is father's note book
ls this your mother?
This was my father's last song
which l learnt from him.
Mother was also not alive then
and she had died 3 yrs before
And father also used to remain
very sick.
The nights are not
being spent easily...
...these nights are filled
with separation
The wet eyes tried a lot to
extinguish the night
The nights are not
being spent easily...
...these nights are filled
with separation
The wet eyes tried a lot to
extinguish the night
Somebody is reminding us
of the talk of the past
Someone is calling by
the forgotten names
The moon...
The nights of the full moon
and the stars...
The night is not setting in
the eyes that are awake
The ages come
and go by
But moments of the small
memories do not go away...
The ages come
and go by
But moments of the small
memories....- do not go away...
The nights are looking black
due to our sorrow
The tearful eyes tried a lot
to pacify the night
The nights are not
being spent easily...
...these nights are filled
with separation
The wet eyes tried a lot to
extinguish the night
Father...are you having
Iot of difficulty.
Shall l call the doctor
uncle?
Respected father, it is 17
years since l left your house...
...or shall l say, after
having my own house
l have lived in my own way
till now as you have said.
But today l have been compelled
to take this favour not for...
...myself but for my five
children who are small.
Please take care of them.
Aiay, -Yes, father
-Come here
Post this letter.
Where were you roaming
in the rains?
Rains have stopped
This is the money for
the stamps
Where are you going?
To post this letter which
father gave.
Give it to me now as
l am getting late.-Ajay...
How was your health yesterday
night? You don't take...
...your treatment also properly.
-Father..
Have you written a letter
to grandfather?
Yes, l have written to him to
come and take you all. - Why?
You make spinach very well.
He also likes it a lot
You make & give that to him
-Don't joke and tell the truth
Your nature is also iust
like your grandfather's.
You will fit there-What've you
written in the letter?
Have you asked for money?
No, your father will never
do that.
Even while dying, he will...
Then why did you write? Do you
remember, how you scolded...
...mother, when she asked you
OnCe.
Go, daughter. Bring tea for
your doctor uncle.
Are the tablets over?
The breathing is over
How can treatment go on like
this?
How many times, l have told you
to get admitted in the hospital
l know. That is why, l have
written to father today
Otherwise, where will l
Ieave these children.
See this, l spit blood ten
times in a day now
The same day, we took father to
the hospital but it was too late
His end could be seen very
clearly in front of us.
Father used to keep asking
about grandfather
Neither he came nor
his letter
But l know, grandfather did not
come deliberately.
Due to his pride and
stubbornness
But when everything was over,
he came to take us
lf father had not taken promise
from me in his last moments...
...l would have never
come here.
Rama, l am not blaming anyone.
But the truth is, everyone...
...erred in understanding
Rai Saheb
You as well as your father...
You think that, Rai Saheb did not
enquire about his son deliberately
But he was actually waiting for
his letter for 17 years.
lf he had written even once, he
would have gone himself...
...and brought him here.
How do you know?
Who told you this?
Rai Saheb himself told me-Why
did'nt he pacify father then?
Where will he go to pacify him?
Where will he write to him?
Your father had not given
any news to him
Why did'nt he come, when
father wrote to him?
See Rama, you have decided this
yourself about Rai Saheb.
Have you ever asked him,
why he did not come?
Why should l ask?
-Then why would he tell you
He had to answer his son
and not to you.
Listen, l will tell you.
When your father's letter came...
...Rai Saheb was not here and
had gone out of station.
He got that letter after
a month.
As soon as he got that letter,
he came without delaying a...
...single moment to meet his son
How do you know?
Again the same question?
He was with you for two...
...days trying to pacify you to
come with him
He was sleeping and living in the
same clothes for two days.
He did'nt have any clothes to
change also. Did U forget that?
What pride did he have that time
to plead to small children...
...requesting and begging
them to come with him
Sir...-Who has got this?
-Masterji - For what?
So that children can play.
-Where is Ravi?-He has gone
He has gone to the city.
He was saying...- Shut up...
Where is Diwanii?-He has gone
outside.-Call him...
l'll call him - Wait...
Who has put this photo here?
-The children...
Where are the children?
- In the school...
Which school? - Where they will
study, sir - In the classroom
What are they doing there?
-Studying, sir
Studying! -They study till
Who is teaching them?
-Sister Rama
Greetings, grandfather
-Greetings, grandfather
When did you come?
-Just some time back...
Salutations at your feet,
grandfather- Bless you, son
Has aunty come? -No, she will
stay at her house now
You all sit and study.
Grandfather, have this
spinach vegetable
l have prepared this as
you like it a lot.
Father had told us once.
-Did Neelu tell you this?
Did he used to remember me?
-Yes & talked a lot about you
Did he say that l am very
stone-hearted?
l have done lot of attrociites
on him.- No, grandfather
He used to say that he has
never seen anyone else who...
...stands on his principles
like his father, in his life
Who is it?
Come inside
Good night, grandfather
-Good night, grandfather
Why are you standing outside?
Come inside
Saniu, who taught you to
say goodnight - Masterji..
Will you stay with me here?
-l'll also stay here, grandfather
l will also stay here
-Both of you stay here only
Grandfather, do you know
stories?
Which story? - The story
of the lame spirit...
No...-l know the story
-Tell me then
One lame spirit was there who
asked who is inside
l am the lame spirit.
l will eat youup.
Come inside, daughter
Who told these stories to them?
Was it Ravi?- Yes
Did Ravi say anything and go?
He said that he has got
a good job in the city and...
...it was necessary for him
to go.
l am very thankful to Ravi
as he has introduced...
...my grandchildren to me.
But one thing l did'nt like
about him
He left without telling me
in my absence.
He has not done the right
thing.
Grandfather is upset only about
the fact that you left...
...without meeting him, or else he
is very happy.
lt is very nice to see him
Iaughing.
You will be surprised to know
that Meeta sleeps with...
...grandfather these days.
Saniu is with me. Aiay and Viiay
have gone to the hostel.
When they were leaving for the
hostel, grandfather had tears...
...as he said that he has not
even lived even to his heart's...
...content with these children.
He took your name and said that
if you had been there...
...you would have taught them
for some more days.
But you must be having lots of
work there.
You won't have any time to meet
Sanju also.
Saniu and others remember
you a lot
Saniu and others remember you a
Iot..
You have read these 50 times
and l have also heard it
But why don't take the names
of those others.
Who is it?..
-What? -Who is it?
Rai Saheb... -then..
Ajay, Vijay... - And...
Narain and Diwanii -Why don't
you take Rama's name?
Why are you shying away
like a sacred lady?
Did you say anything to Rama?
-Yes...-What?
Only that, l will miss
her a lot - What?
What else then? Then should l
do drama like they do in films.
What did she tell you while you
were leaving??- No...
When l was leaving, everyone
including Sanju came out with me
l don't feel like going, Diwanii.
But the job is such that...
...l don't feel like leaving it.
Please ask for forgiveness...
...from Raisaheb from my side
when he comes & explain to him
Shall l leave, Aiay? Will you
remember, whatever l've told U?
Yes sir-Viiay...
-Yes sir
Munni...- When will you come
back, sir
l wil come for your marriage.
Will you call me? -No
Why are you going, sir?
-l have to go...
...as l have work
-When will you come again?
l will come soon, Saniu
Where is your sister?
-She is crying in her room.
Rama...-Won't you ever come
to meet grandfather?
l will surely come to
meet you, Rama
Shall l leave?
Ravi, l feel that you should
go and meet her
And talk to Rama if you can
What? -See now
Rama won't be able to speak to
Rai Saheb herself even though...
...she loves you -Do you think,
l can speak with Rai Saheb?
lf you know Rama's feelings for
sure, you can tell him.
lf you can't tell yourself, you can
ask your uncle to speak.
But that poor Rama has no
other way at all
She has no parents.
To whom will she tell?
lf you go to meet them, Rai
Saheb may understand himself
Come on, rise your head
Good, don't touch your
eyes now.
Wear these glasses.
Sheru, take the children inside as
it is very hot. Go, children
Greetings, Rai Saheb
Why have you come now?
Who called you here?
Nobody called me. l iust
came to meet.
Whom have you come to meet?
-What? -Rama or the children..
l have come to meet everybody.
-You've not come to meet me
lf you cared for me, you would
not have run away in my absence
l am sorry that l had to go in
your absence. But you know me.
And l had finished the work
you had given to me.
Who said that your work is
over? You just corrected the...
...children and the rest...
-Who are the rest?
Me, who will reform me.
You still have to correct
me.
Sit, Ravi
-Thank you, Rai Saheb
Ravi, the children have
themselves corrected me.
l am very happy and
grateful to you.
As you have made me
close to the children
Or else, rest of my life would
have also gone in regret.
And children would have only
known that their grandfather...
...was a tyrant.
-No, Rai Saheb
Happiness cannot be imprisoned
into a fist
You had so much love in you,
that its fragrance would have...
...reached the children in
some way.
How are Saniu and the others?
Ajay and Vijay must be...
...writing letters from their
hostel.
l get letters from them every
week...
But how do you know that they
have gone to the hostel.
Rama had written a letter.
l had told her to write to me...
...after U come as to how much
l had succeeded in my work.
Actually, you should have written
a letter congratulating me.
Definitely not, you should have
written to me... Leave it
l have lost to one son due to
my obstinancy
l don't want to do that
mistake again.
l'll tell you this news, which
might be a very happy news
l have a friend from
the army time
They are a good well-to-do
family.
l am talking about Rama's
marriage with his grandson.
She will be very comfortable
if she goes there
Does Rama know this?
-No...
l am completely broken
somewhere inside me.
l have become weak.
l don't know why l feel scared
to tell my little daughter.
lf she says no, l won't
be able to bear that.
There is no reason for
this fear.
Ravi, l could not conduct my
son's marriage as l wished
But l have a great wish to
conduct this grand daughter's...
...marriage in my way.
Maybe l want to wash away
my previous sins
Come, let us go to the hall, Ravi
It is very hot now
Where are Saniu and Meeta?
- Must be in their room.
Go and meet them. They will be
very happy to meet you.
They keep remembering you
a lot.
Ravi, l could not conduct my
son's marriage as l wished
But l have a great wish to

...marriage in my way.

Somebody is remembering you and
that is why you are coughing.
Who will remember me, sister?
-Masterji is remembering you.
Why does he remember me
often?
He loves you and hence
remembers you often.
Sister, masterii loves you too.
-No, as sister did'nt cough?
Masterii only must be
coughing now
l am a wanderer, friends
l have no house or
place to live
The day held my hands
and made me sit here
And the night called me there
by giving a signal
This is my story
from day to night
l am a wanderer, friends
l have no house
or place to live
l have to go and
just have to keep going
What happened? Where are you
preparing to leave?
To go to the city. Uncle, l am
Ieaving by the afternoon train.
But, what is the hurry?
You have just come
You stay for 2-3 days.-No uncle,
l had told Amit and come
What is the matter? Why are
you looking upset - Nothing...
Did you meet Rai Saheb?
-_ es
Did you meet Rama?- Yes..
-How is Rama?
She is fine.
Where are you going?
-To the kitchen
Where is Ravi?
-Ravi...
Did'nt he meet you?
Where were you?
ln our rooms-He had come
there to meet you.
Did he come? When?
-One hour back.
But why did he go away without
meeting you all.
Rama...-Yes...
Come here...
Come near me.
Come more close.
l don't like your coming like this
and going away immediately
lt seems that you had
just come to touch this place
You wait...
l will just see.
The whistle has been given. You
get in now. Take care...
Keep writing letters.
Panditii...
Where is Ravi?
What?
-Has Ravi gone?
What?- l am asking you
whether Ravi has left.
The discretion of our old age is
that we should leave from here.
