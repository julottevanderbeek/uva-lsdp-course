I got to meet a gang of people
at my mother's saloon.
You want to come? It's a
party for me, honest.
- I'd love to.
- Really? You mean it?
Why? Have you changed your mind?
No, no, I mean, I-I know
it isn't every day that a
glorified ziegfeld girl
like me asks you out.
Man: Thank you, Rachel,
that was lovely.
That's it?
All I needed to see.
It was a pleasure
reading with you.
And I loved you as Lancelot.
I saw the revival
of  three times...
four, if you
include the bootleg
that my friend Kurt has, so...
Thanks.
Well, Paolo,
you're our Tony winner.
What did you think?
Aw, she's charming.
And she certainly looks
right for the part.
I just fear that
she's too young,
you know, too green?
That was my concern as well.
Lack of experience.
She'd be a discovery,
but it's such a risk.
Paolo: I mean, that
part, it's a mountain.
At her age, I never
could have pulled it off.
Now, where did we leave it
with Claire Danes' people?
Yesterday
all my troubles seemed
so far away
now it looks as though
they're here to stay
oh, I believe
in yesterday
suddenly
I'm not half the girl
I used to be
there's a shadow
hanging over me
oh, yesterday
came suddenly
why he
had to go
I don't know
he wouldn't say...
I said
something wrong
now I long for yesterday
hey, ye-ye-yesterday
love was such an easy
game to play
now I need a place
to hide away
oh, I believe
in yesterday
why he had to go
I don't know
he wouldn't say
I said something wrong
now I long
for yesterday
hey, yeah
oh, yesterday
love was such
an easy game to play
now I need a place
to hide away
oh, I believe
in yesterday
ooh, ooh, ooh
ooh-hoo.
I don't think
we've ever spent two weeks
on an assignment, Mr. Shue.
Hey, the Beatles are so epic
that we need two weeks
to do them justice.
This week is all about the
early years of the Beatles,
when all they had was
a belief in each other
and a belief that together
they could do anything.
The school year seems
like it's never ending,
and now we're wasting
two whole weeks
on a band from the 1940s?
Seriously, can anyone
still relate to the Beatles?
Pretty much the entire world.
Yeah, I can
definitely still relate.
Kitty:
Why?
Were the Beatles dyslexic
and cat-fished
by transsexuals?
And you wonder
why everybody hates you.
Marley:
When George Harrison was a kid,
he was made fun of 'cause
his dad was the bus driver.
Jake: John Lennon's dad
wasn't even around.
He walked out of John's
life when he was five.
I don't really know the Beatles;
I'm a little on the black side.
Artie: And Ringo starr was
a sickly little kid,
which probably means
he was sitting down a lot.
Will:
And they decided to form a band.
Which changed the world.
Now, you guys are
really gonna have
to challenge yourselves
this week.
Bring your a-plus games.
Perform these classic songs
in new and exciting ways.
If we can push ourselves
to a whole new level,
like the Beatles did constantly,
we can win back-to-back
national championships
and form
a new directions! Dynasty.
All right, see you
guys tomorrow.
Tina.
And speaking of...
Your chariot awaits.
Okay, we're moving
slower than Jonah hill
trying to get out
of the bathtub.
And everyone is staring.
Yeah, at our hotness.
You know, I never thanked you
for making me come
clean with my mom.
I'm going to the Brooklyn
film academy because of you.
And to thank you, I want
to take you to Breadstix.
Besides, we both know
that the raw, animal attraction
between us is undeniable.
Did you really just say that?
No wonder Tina
broke up with you.
And Brittany and sugar and
the girl in the wheelchair
with the disturbingly
massive boobs.
And ps, I hate Breadstix.
Okay, well, there's
a carnival in town.
That could be fun.
Yeah, if you want
to trust your life
to toothless carnies
who operate the rides.
Okay.
So is that a yes or a no?
Asked a girl
what she wanted to be
she said
both:
baby, can't you see?
I want to be famous,
a star on the screen
but you can do something
in between
baby, you can drive my car
yes, I'm gonna be a star
baby, you can drive my car
and maybe I'll love you...
I told the girl that my prospects
were good
And she said, "baby..."
Both:  it's understood are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?
Working for peanuts
is all very fine
but I can show you
a better time
baby, you can drive my car
yes, I'm gonna be a star
baby, you can drive my car
and maybe I'll love you
beep-beep'm,
beep-beep, yeah...
I told that girl
I can start right away
and she said, listen, babe,
I got something to say
I got no car
and it's breaking my heart
but I found a driver
and that's a start
baby, you can drive my car
yes, I'm gonna be a star
baby, you can drive my car
and maybe I'll love you
beep-beep'm, beep-beep, yeah
beep-beep'm,
beep-beep, yeah
beep-beep'm, beep-beep, yeah
beep-beep'm,
beep-beep, yeah
beep-beep'm, beep-beep
yeah!
Tiger's my favorite, though.
I like the pink one.
Hey, Kitty-Kat.
Girl, you crashed
into me head-on.
I swear, you could have
paralyzed me.
My bad.
I'm Bree, spelled with two es.
Not like the funky cheese.
Artie.
You two were so cute,
all snuggly
and cuddled up
in that teeny, tiny car.
Are you two going out?
Nope. Just friends.
Well, you should.
You look really sweet together.
I hope you don't mind.
I took a couple of pictures
and instagrammed them.
Anyway, have fun.
She seems nice.
She's a stone-cold bitch
and she's out to destroy me.
Okay.
You and me...
We're more than "just friends."
What if we go out...
But we do it on the down-low?
You know, like secretly
gay conservatives do.
It'll make everything
all fun and forbidden.
So you like me...
But you don't want
to be seen with me.
I need status at this school
to survive.
Yeah, right.
This was a mistake.
Okay, no, Rachel, you
are not backing out.
I basically had to show
Gunther my left side boob
to get you this job.
Here, put this on.
Look, santana,
while I really appreciate
you freely prostituting
yourself for me,
that was before my
world came crashing down
and I totally blew my
chemistry read.
You're late, Lopez!
Yes, yes, I know,
sorry, Gunther.
Is that her?
Yes, this is her.
Rachel, that's Gunther.
Don't tell him if
you're Jewish or black.
Listen.
You said it yourself
a bazillion times.
You want to get to Broadway,
you have to pay your dues.
Well, I mean,
I guess that's true.
Patti Lupone was a waitress,
And, you know, this is
the spotlight diner,
and it's on Broadway, and
waiters get to sing and dance.
Plus my dads would pay
my rent till I died,
and I don't want that anymore
because I want to be
grown up and living
and making it on my own.
We're basically
working actresses.
Blaine: So, you excited
to go back to school?
Kurt:
Yeah, fashion week is coming up.
But this farewell picnic's
been perfect, though.
What's the story
with this New York guy?
There's no story.
He was nice and people liked
the idea of us as a couple,
but never got serious.
All right,
let me break it down for you.
All right,
the last time we tried dating,
and I was in New York
and you were here,
you cheated on me.
All right, unacceptable.
We've been through this.
I thought you were done with me.
I thought it was over.
I thought I was completely
out of the picture in your life.
Look at me in the eyes
when I say this.
I'm being beyond serious.
I will never, ever...
Ever cheat on you again.
I'm gonna need you to sign one
of those non-cheating contracts.
You know, you can get one
on Oprah's web site.
I will sign whatever you want.
Just please say that you and I
can be boyfriends again.
What?
I don't know
if relationships actually work.
I mean, weren't Bethenny and
Jason supposed to be forever?
For every Bethenny and Jason,
there is a Will and a Jada,
and a-a Kurt and a Goldie.
Come on, can we at least
just give it a try?
But I'm Goldie, of course.
Of course you are.
I-I can't believe
we're gonna do this again.
I was hoping you would say yes.
Actually I was kind
of planning on it,
which I why I sort of, um,
put something together
to try to convince you
to stay a little longer.
Uh, no, no, no,
that's not gonna happen, okay?
I-I'm not sitting down
and listening to you
sing to me anymore.
Okay.
Which is why
prepared something.
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what
I would find there
another road where maybe I
could see another
kind of mind there
ooh
then I suddenly see you
ooh
did I tell you I need you
every single day
of my life?
Got to get you into my life
what can I do?
What can I be?
When I'm with you,
I want to stay there
if I'm true, I never leave
and if I do, I
know the way there
Both:
ooh, then I suddenly see you
ooh
did I tell you I need you
every single day
of my life?
Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know
what I would find there
another road where maybe I
could see another kind
of mind there
and I suddenly see you
did I tell you I need you
both:
oh
I got to get you
into my life.
America, your prayers
have been answered.
Welcome back, Coach Sylvester.
It's Principal Sylvester.
Man:
We've had some complaints.
Oh, Mr. Roberts.
What's going on?
I think you have a few
things in your desk
you may want to share with us.
Sue:
We're gonna be
here for a while.
It's not mine!
That's puppy porn.
I'm telling you, it's not mine!
I go to church every Sunday,
for God's sake.
Mein Kampf.
I'm telling you, I am innocent!
Roberts:
Our hands are tied, Mr. Figgins.
Where am I supposed to go?
What am I supposed to do?
Well, superintendent
Harris, I have to say,
I'm truly humbled.
We're in a pinch here, coach,
and you're a proven champion.
You've led the school before
as interim principal,
and if all goes well
after a few months,
I see no reason
why this position
shouldn't become permanent.
Sue: Do I feel guilty
about what I did?
You're a monster, Sue Sylvester!
Here I stand, head in hand
turn my face to the wall
if she's gone
I can't go on
feeling two foot small...
Everywhere people stare
each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
and I hear them say...
Both:
hey
you've got to hide
your love away
hey
you've got to hide
your love away
how could she say to me
love will find a way?
Gather 'round
all you clowns
let me hear you say...
Hey
you've got to hide
your love away
hey, you've got to hide
your love away
oh
hey
you've got to hide
your love away
oh, hey
you've got to hide
your love away.
Okay, listen up, everybody.
Come on.
Blaine has a very special
announcement to make.
That's right.
So, as most of you know already,
um, Kurt and I are
officially back together.
I know,
but what most of you don't know,
and this is top secret,
is that I'm going
to ask Kurt to marry me.
Yeah, guys, come on!
Get up! Come on, guys!
He's my best friend.
Gay marriage... good.
It's good, it's good things.
They're all happening so fast.
- Let's go!
- Sam, not now.
Anyway, I want this proposal
to be just incredible,
so I'm asking for
all of your help,
but I'm also asking for some
of our competitors' help.
Like the warblers
and vocal adrenaline
and the Haverbrook
school for the deaf.
Vocal adrenaline? No, ma'am.
The warblers are
evil incarnate little craps.
Are you crazy? Are you insane?
Good God,
have you lost your mind?
Tina, everybody,
hear him out.
Look, I want this to be more
than just an ordinary proposal.
I want this
to be a cultural statement.
Sure you do.
Hey, our generation
is at a turning point.
People everywhere...
except, like, Russia...
are beginning to see
that it doesn't matter
who you are
or where you're from
or even what God you believe in.
They're beginning to see
that people
really aren't
all that different.
And honestly, if we can get a
bunch of cutthroat show choirs
to stand side-by-side
and unite in something,
then anything is possible.
Okay, okay,
but Blaine is just using
the world of rival glee clubs
as a metaphor
for this incredible time
we're in right now.
: But I still
think you're too young.
Help! I need somebody
help! Not just anybody
help!
You know I need someone
help!
When I was younger,
so much younger than today
I never needed
anybody's help in any way
but now these days are gone
I'm not so self-assured
now I find
I've changed my mind
and opened up the doors
help me if you can
I'm feeling down
and I do appreciate
you being 'round
help me get my feet
back on the ground
won't you please
please help me?
And now my life has changed
in, oh, so many ways
my independence seems
to vanish in the haze
but every now and then
I feel so insecure
I know that I
just need you like
I've never done before
help me if you can
I'm feeling down
and I do appreciate you
being 'round
help me get my feet
back on the ground
won't you please,
please help me?
When I was younger
so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help
in any way
but now these days are gone
I'm not so self-assured
and now I find
I've changed my mind
I've opened up the doors
help me if you can,
I'm feeling down
and I do appreciate you
being 'round
help me get my feet back
on the ground
won't you please,
please help me?
Help me, help me, ooh.
We need an official vote,
but in the spirit of brotherhood
and cleaning up
our tarnished reputation,
I think we'd all be happy
to help.
Uh, Trent, we said
I'd do the talking.
All in favor of helping Blaine?
All:
Aye!
Artie, we've been
friends for a long time,
so I'm just gonna ask,
are you and Kitty an item?
What? No.
I mean, yes.
I mean, maybe.
I'm unclear. It's sort of this
secret affair
we're not really supposed
to talk about.
Yes! I knew it!
Why? Why can't you?
Lower your voice, Tina.
Because Kitty's uncomfortable
with people knowing
she's dating...
Someone who wears glasses
who's in a wheelchair
who's in glee club?
Where's your self-respect?
Tina, I know you're trying
to help.
Like, at least I think you are.
So I'm gonna say thank you.
All right, got your burger
and your salad. Enjoy.
Oh, my God, you're not gonna
believe this text
I just got from Blaine.
You're not gonna believe
who's sitting in my section.
Mmm, I'll take this.
Okay, so we have one Roxie
and one Velma,
a side of Billy Flynns.
Yes, it's me,
and, yes, it's awkward,
but I don't care,
because I am a professional.
Even when people are calling me
"too young" or-or "green,"
which, for your information,
I'm not.
I am a...
Am a star.
Yes, I am a star.
Rachel, look,
it's not personal.
Everyone thinks they're a star,
even when they're not.
Look around.
They all want
to be on Broadway.
Look, I'm not saying
you're not a star, Rachel.
Just saying
I'm not sure just yet.
I understand.
I guess I'll just have
to prove it to you, then.
It's been a hard day's night
and I've been working
like a dog
it's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping
like a log
so why on earth
should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone,
you know I feel okay
when I'm home
everything seems to be right
when I'm home
feeling you holding me tight
tight, yeah
it's been a hard day's night
and I've been working
like a dog
it's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping
like a log
but when I get home to you
I find the things
that you do
will make me feel all right
ow!
So why on earth
should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
you know I feel okay
when I'm home
everything seems to be right
when I'm home
feeling you holding me tight
tight, yeah
it's been a hard day's night
and I've been working
like a dog
it's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping
like a log
but when I get home to you
I find the things
that you do
will make me feel all right
you know I feel all right
you know
I feel all right.
Let's get out of here.
Wait... after all that?
We have to go home.
There's something special
we need to do.
I don't know what
you're so nervous about.
She's not going after
the cheerios!
It's the glee club she hates.
Bitch, please.
Sue Sylvester's had it out
for me since day one.
I took her job, remember?
I just know she's dug up
all kind of dirt on me.
What kind of dirt?
Number one, this bronze
damn olympic medal
in individual synchronized
swimming I won
at them Chinese Olympics
may have been
the result of some performance-
enhancing drugs and weed.
Number two, I may have
perpetrated a buttload
of credit card fraud.
An old lady in Florida
may have paid for my condo,
and I might have just
flat-out stole my lexus
off a used car lot.
Well, then, yeah,
we're both screwed.
Sue's gonna take out
the glee club
and the cheerios!
In one fell swoop.
Oh, now why on earth would I do
something like that, Buttchin?
Because you're vindictive
and petty.
Oh, well, you're forgetting
one thing, William.
I have been given the post of
interim principal at this school.
A post that will be made
permanent
at the end of the year
if all goes according to plan,
allowing me to demolish
this office down to the studs,
ridding it once and for all
of the deep, ethnic musk
that is Figgins' hallmark.
Now, in order to achieve that,
I need the programs
at this school to be successful.
I need the teams
at McKinley high to be winners.
Wait, wait,
y-you're not firing us?
Not if you win a national
championship, I'm not.
However, if you fail to win at
Nationals, I will fire you.
You'll be forced to build
creepy relationships
with teenagers on your own time.
And you, you'll have to go back
to being a full-time spokesmodel
for Billy Dee Williams'
yellow hair helmets
for women who couldn't possibly
be less blonde.
Congratulations.
You're on my watch now,
which means...
You're winners.
Okay, guys, week one of
our Beatles fest has been epic.
I think we've really unpacked
what made the fab four
such a instant sensation,
but now I want to turn to their
oft-ignored middle period.
Mr. Shue, would you say
that the early Beatles looked
out for each other
even when they didn't want
to be looked out for?
Oh, God, no.
If I understand your question,
Tina,
yes, the early Beatles
always had each other's backs.
In that case, I'm sorry, Artie,
but this
is for your own good.
Everyone, Kitty and Artie
are dating,
but Kitty's making Artie hide it
because she's embarrassed
by him,
and I think
that's emotional abuse.
Artie is a great guy, and
he deserves to be loved openly
and proudly
and without conditions.
For once we agree.
It's true.
Arthur and I are dating.
We are? Officially?
And for the record... and not
that it's anyone's business,
especially not yours,
Tina Cohen-agitator...
I did want to keep it hush-hush.
Because you were ashamed.
Yes, memoirs of a lame geisha,
because I occupy
a certain place
in the McKinley hierarchy,
and you all occupy a different,
lesser place in that hierarchy,
and before exploding
said hierarchy
by jumping up and down
on Oprah's couch,
declaring my undying love for
someone who is, let's face it,
not my usual body type...
I wanted to be sure.
Of what?
That I really, really liked him.
And that I would be willing
to risk
not just my social standing
but also getting hurt
by letting him wheel
into my heart.
And even though I know
he's getting ready to graduate,
and we're probably just
as doomed as every other sad,
broken, backwards relationship
that's ever started
in this Jesus-and love-forsaken
choir room...
Kurt and I  have
a happy ending.
But I do like you, Artie.
You make me laugh,
and not just with those stupid
YouTube fail videos
you're always showing me.
Look, asking you to keep
our stuff private wasn't cool,
and I'm sorry.
It's okay, Kitty.
But, um, as far as, like,
updating my Facebook status...
Yes, we are officially,
publicly, shockingly
a thing.
You guys...
Do any of you know
why I call you in here?
Uh, is it to get prepared
in case
the North Koreans invade
through Mexico?
I just saw  okay?
It could happen.
One of our own has turned
into a mean, bitter,
and angry person.
Tina. Tina. That'd be Tina.
She didn't used to be like this.
She was a sweet girl who dated
Artie until he dumped her
because he found out
she was faking her stutter.
And then she dated Mike Chang
until he dumped her
because she wasn't Asian enough
or something.
Wait... is that really why
he dumped her? Yeah.
Look, the point is, is that
it's time for us to step in.
She's falling apart.
I walked by
the too young to be bitter club
Those cakes are truly awesome.
Dude, those things were moist
and chocolaty at the same time.
Totally, totally.
Guys, this isn't
about the cakes.
I know how good they are.
I've had them, too.
This is about us trying
to help Tina.
Oh, of course, Blaine.
You know, even though this is
all clearly your fault,
you know, whatever you think
we should do, we're in.
Ah, settling in nicely,
then, are we?
You know, I think you
found your calling.
Janitor Figgins, I think,
has a quiet dignity to it.
You're not gonna get away
with this, Sue.
Well, I believe I already have.
And considering all
the scandalous behavior
that I recently uncovered,
I would say you are lucky
to have a job at all.
You had better be nice to Donna.
That woman is a Saint.
And she's my rock.
I'm afraid Donna isn't long
for this world.
As soon as she returns
from her suspension,
I plan on installing Becky
as my secretary.
And I will refer
to her as my "beckretary."
What is that?
That? Well, that's just
a five-gallon bucket
of expired grade D meat slurry
the poor kids at this school
were forced to eat
every taco Tuesday under
the jackboot of that corrupt,
decadent regime from which
they were recently liberated
by one Sue Rodham Sylvester.
That's not your middle name.
Oh, yes, it is.
I had it legally changed
this morning.
Now, what would you
like me to do with this canister
of rancid horse offal?
No, Sue, please! No!
:
No!
Sue Sylvester!
You are a monster!
Tina:
What is happening
and why did you
make me wear this?
I had to break out
one of the  costumes.
:
Tina, I'm Paul.
That's George, that's Ringo,
and black John Lennon.
Half black.
: We love
you, and this is for you.
One, two, three, four!
Well, she was just 17
and you know what I mean
and the way she looked
was way beyond compare
So how could I dance
with another
ooh
when I saw her
standing there?
Well, my heart went boom
when I crossed that room
and I held
her hand in mine...
Whoa, we danced
through the night
and we held each other tight
and before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance
with another
ooh
since I saw her
standing there
ow...!
Come on, dance!
Hey!
Whoa, we danced
through the night
and we held each other tight
and before too long
I fell in love with her...
Now I'll never dance
with another
ooh
since I saw her
standing there...
oh, since I saw her
standing there
yeah, well, since I saw her
standing there.
That was awesome.
But I don't understand
what it was for.
Well, we saw how lonely
you've been lately.
And since we're the only
single guys left in glee club...
And by single,
we mean single prom dates...
We just wanted
to offer our services
as dance partner
or corsage buyer
or just general arm candy
for the big dance.
Yeah, so you can pick one.
And it's your choice.
Obviously I'm excluded.
Well, it's hard to pick.
Ryder has arms
and Blaine is my boo,
but I think I'll go with Sam,
because he's the least gay
and least Asian of all of you
and I'm looking
to change my patterns.
Seriously, though...
Thank you, guys.
I really needed this.
Bring it in, Tina.
Oh, I love you.
I love you.
Thank you, boo.
Look, I, uh, know
we usually take
the highway to the airport,
but somebody told me
about this shortcut
through the back roads.
Dad, you can stop it.
I know you're driving me
to my surprise proposal.
I should have known you knew.
You're the kid who planned
his own surprise party
for his tenth birthday.
That Justin Timberlake piñata
was a perfect likeness.
Well, I wouldn't know.
You okay?
You look like I'm driving you
to your execution.
I can't tell.
I mean, I really
love Blaine, and...
He makes me feel so connected
and safe and loved,
and I don't think I'm ever
gonna find someone else
who's gonna make me
feel like that.
But we're both so young.
Um...
Your mom and I met
when we were 22,
and I asked her to marry
me six months in.
We were just kids.
is gonna be like:
Nothing but laughing
and dancing around
in your underwear,
cooking pasta,
It's hard being married, though.
It's hard enough
being in your 20s.
Do you wish you'd waited?
Not one second more.
I wish I'd met her
ten years earlier.
I didn't know then that
I was only going to get
so much time
with her, you know?
That she was gonna
leave us so soon.
I'd take 50 more years
of late-night fights
about, you know,
me working late
or the gas bill
or her letting the milk
go bad for just...
Ten more minutes
with her next to me.
We only get a few days
when you come down to it, Kurt.
You know that
better than anyone.
Look, totally
being honest here...
Blaine asked me
what I thought about this,
and I gave him my opinion.
Which was?
My opinion doesn't matter here.
You're your own man now.
But giving you a choice
means you gotta make one.
So relax.
Hear what the guy has to say.
I mean, all you gotta do
is say yes, no, or maybe.
Is there another option?
Love, love, love
love, love, love
love, love, love
there's nothing you can do
that can't be done
nothing you can sing
that can't be sung
nothing you can say
but you can learn
how to play the game
it's easy
nothing you can make
that can't be made
no one you can save
that can't be saved
nothing you can do
but you can learn
how to be you in time
it's easy
all you need is love
all you need is love
all you need is love, love
love is all you need
nothing you can know
that isn't known
nothing you can see that isn't
shown
there's nowhere you can be
that isn't where
you're meant to be
it's easy
all you need is love
all you need is love
all you need is love, love
love is all you need
all you need is love
all you need is love
all you need is love, love
love is all you need
love is all you need
love is all you need
love is all you need
love is all you need
he loves you,
yeah, yeah, yeah
he
loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
he loves you, yeah
yeah, yeah.
We met right here.
I took this man's hand,
and we ran down that hallway...
And for those of you
that know me,
know I'm not in the habit
of taking people's hands
I've never met before, but...
I think that
my soul knew something
that my body and my mind
didn't know yet.
It knew that our hands
were meant to hold each other,
fearlessly
and forever.
Which is why
it's never really felt like
I've been getting to know you;
it's always felt like I was
remembering you from something.
As if in every lifetime
that you and I have ever lived,
we have chosen to come back
and find each other
and fall in love all over again,
over and over for all eternity.
And I just feel so lucky
that I found you
so soon in this lifetime,
because all I want to do,
all-all I've ever
wanted to do...
Is spend my life loving you.
So...
Kurt Hummel...
My amazing friend,
my one true love...
...will you marry me?
Yeah. Yeah.
Beautiful.
