"Tomorrow, new leaves will sprout"
"And new flowers will blossom"
"Fresh new footsteps will leave
their mark on new grasslands"
"She did not walk into my life
Why, should I enter her life?"
"From waking dawns to sunset dusks..."
"by what right do I take from her...
the moments that are hers?"
"In a moment my poetry will be sung.
In a moment my story will have ended"
"For only a moment
I will live in ecstasy"
"For I have only a moment
to live my youth"
"In a moment my poetry will be sung"
"Many have come before me
Many before me have sung their songs"
"Some sang their sorrows
Some sang their hearts out"
"They lived their moment
As I live mine"
"Tomorrow we will separate"
"But for this moment I'm yours"
"In a moment my poetry will be sung"
"Tomorrow, there will come another"
"In search for the new couplet
In search of the fresh blossom"
"Some will be better poets than I am
Some better listeners than you make"
"In that tomorrow,
will someone remember me?"
"But why should anyone
remember me?"
"Why should this busy world
waste its time for me?"
"For in a moment, my poetry
will have been sung."
My autograph?
Yes! Your verses are so touching!
Did you like it?
- Very much!
Why the autograph?
You can keep the verses.
Maybe, you're the one
they were written for.
But your name isn't on it...
your name, please.
My name? What is my name?
I look at you, and I think
I have forgotten my own name.
Write something... for me.
What's your name?
Pooja
Then maybe I shall call myself
the priest.
Your eyes... have you ever
looked in your eyes?
Anything special?
One look into those eyes,
and one wishes one could relate.
"In silence I shall worship you
Though what I seek I may not have"
"To my the object of my worship,
Pooja"
Amit
"If I can hold your hand
A pleasance will be my journey"
"Success enough it is for me
If I win your love for me"
"This question that I ask of you
Answer me not if you will not"
"But hidden in your silence lie
A thousand words speak themselves"
"Every moment this life I live
Each moment I cherish your beauty"
"Every time your lips part for me
It is the beginning of a new day"
"In the darkness of your hair
The pleasures of a sensual night"
"When I hold your hand
A pleasance is my journey"
At times, this looks like a dream.
Back in the hostel, they go to bed
with your poetry under their pillows.
Some have even married
your photographs.
If girls know you're in love with me,
they'll kill themselves.
Poor girls...
Why "poor"?
They fall in love with
someone's photograph.
And then they will marry yet
someone else.
If not "poor", how else do you
describe these creatures?
Is it their fault? Parents never ask
a girl for her opinion.
Girls are forced into marriages.
You won't do that, will you?
I'll let you have the answer
after I've asked Mom and Dad.
Is that a challenge?
Or is it a joke?
Are you propositioning?
Or are you testing waters?
I just want to be happy in life.
- What does it take to make you happy?
Brighten up my every morning
with a smile from these lips.
Bring the light into my nights,
with those eyes of yours.
Go on. Flatter me.
Coming from you, I like it.
"Sometimes"
"My heart tells me"
"You were created for me"
"Up there with the stars you were"
"Till you were sent down to earth
for my sake"
"My heart tells me at times"
"Your body, your soul, your eyes
are mine"
"The shade of these tresses
were made for me"
"Your body, your lips, your arms
are mine and mine and mine alone"
"My heart sings to me sometimes"
"In the tunes of the shehnai"
"We are birds in a nest"
"We are to fly away one day"
"We will fly far away"
"The dazzle of the color red
in the bride's trousseau
"The sparkle of the dot
on the bride's forehead"
"The chime of bangles on
the bride's hands dyed in henna"
"The heartbeats that promise
those beautiful dreams"
"The magic of the kohl
in the bride's eyes"
"The subtle scent of flowers
in her hair"
"The faint quiver of soft lips"
"The blush of the heat on her face"
"The musk of her sweat"
"The burning desire
of her passions"
"The hesitant jingle of her anklets"
"With finery she is adorned"
"But for whom?"
"For whom am I?"
"My dear father, the palanquin
that will carry me away from you"
"Will not pass through these doors"
"Let me go, as if
I were a brick in your wall"
"We are birds in a nest"
"We are to fly away one day"
"We will fly far away"
Amit, you tell me what should I do.
My parents have fixed
my marriage elsewhere.
Had I even mentioned you...
Oh I can't imagine what
they would've done!
There are my parents...
and here you are...
I don't know what to do!
Tell me, what am I to do?
I think you should marry him.
Will you forget me?
I'll never forgive myself
the day I forget you.
How will I live this life?
You'll be a good wife. And I'll try
to become a good human being.
Will you promise me something?
We'd rather not make
any more promises.
I'm asking for my right.
Go on.
You won't stop writing poems.
Writing poetry isn't mechanical...
say like building a house
with brick and mortar.
But if you keep writing,
it will make me happy.
Pooja...
Yes Amit...
Maybe this is the last time
I'm calling you "Pooja".
Decided? After due deliberation?
Yes.
May I ask why?
Even for the sake of our happiness,
we have no right to ignore...
the wishes of our parents. We can't
trample upon their sentiments...
to build a world for ourselves...
That leaves nothing to ask or say.
Nothing!
I put together a few poems
for my first anthology.
I wanted you to have the first copy.
As a gift of love.
With time and circumstance,
this becomes your wedding gift.
Now who would have guessed that?
My wedding gift. For you.
Were I a poet, I would've
written an anthology for you.
Poetry is my weakness.
And this poet in particular.
And his anthology,
"Kabhi Kabhie" - "Sometimes".
In every line,
he has poured his heart out.
If we ever meet happen
to meet this poet...
we'll surely ask him to
read his poetry for us.
We'll tell him that he was with us
on first night together.
I hear you sing very well.
Will you sing one of these verses?
For our first night together...
"Sometimes"
"My heart tells me"
"You were created for me"
"Up there with the stars you were"
"Till you were sent down to earth
for my sake"
"My heart tells me at times"
"Your body, your soul, your eyes
are mine"
"The shade of these tresses
were made for me"
"Your body, your lips, your arms
are mine and mine and mine alone"
"My heart sings to me sometimes"
"In the tunes of the shehnai"
"On our first night together
I will lift the veil"
"You are shy and you quaver
As I take you in my arms"
"My heart asks me"
"Will you love me
like this all my life?"
"Will you always look at me
with love in your eyes?"
"I know, you belong
to someone else"
"But still..."
"Sometimes"
"Sometimes"
"I think of you"
Get up.
What happened?
Well, what...?
If I walked down to the reception
looking like this...
and told the well-dressed
receptionist, "Good morning, miss"...
imagine what she will say?
- She'll say, you're shameless.
Get up. The sun is shining through.
- The sun never rises on a honeymoon.
They say, the honeymoon
is a night of days.
Crazy!
Even if the sun happens to rise,
all you have to do...
is keep your eyes screwed tight.
That's all it takes to make a night.
Haven't you anything else to do?
- No.
You know before marrying you,
I used to think that...
a man must never marry.
Just waltz through a dozen affairs.
But having done the deed,
my philosophy is completely changed.
Marriage is a checking account
in a bank: encashable at will.
Encashable only if
you have a balance.
Else, your check is likely to bounce.
Let's find out, sweetheart!
Back, son?
Well, what have you decided?
I've given up thinking, Dad.
You think poetry is the only thing
that needs thinking?
You think I don't think
before I act?
I didn't mean that, Dad.
That Amit, who used to write poetry...
I've left him far behind.
It's your son Amit who is
standing in front of you.
And what if you happen to find
your old self once again?
In the first place, I'll refuse to
recognise him. But if he's adamant...
I'll shake his hand, I'll smile
and I'll walk past him.
I hope you aren't
getting emotional?
No father.
It isn't that I don't
appreciate your poetry.
I've read your book
several times over.
You're a very good poet.
- Let's not discuss it, Dad.
No, I'm telling you the truth.
But I don't have another son.
I don't have a daughter.
You're the only one I have
in this whole wide world.
And my business.
And no matter the size...
this is the dream I cherish.
I wish you'll make my dream come true.
It's what every father
expects from his son.
I won't disappoint you, Dad.
You have my word.
I won't give you a chance
to complain.
I'll fulfil your dream
in every possible way.
I promise you.
Vicky! Bravo, my boy!
You aren't riding a mule.
It's a horse! Gallop!
Look how fast he's riding.
He'll take a few falls
before he becomes a good rider.
What?
He isn't a coward like you.
Stop worrying.
My son is a lion!
I know, great lion!
- A lion! Like me!
Gitty up!
Excuse me, Miss Pinky...
- How do you know my name?
Leave my hand!
- Never let go of the hand!
That's what my Dad says.
- You know what my Mom says?
What?
- If a boy ever holds your hand...
make sure you slap
him so hard...
that his cheek comes out
looking like India's map!
Go ahead with your cartography.
Now my Dad also says that if
a girl is shy, you can conclude...
What's this Dad business?
Are you still a baby?
If your Mom meets my Dad,
she'll fall in love with him.
Give my scarf back.
You don't ask for a
gift to be returned.
Now where would you find
a boyfriend like me?
Who would fall for a scarf worth
four-and-three-quarters?
Where do you think
you're going, lady?
"Being in love isn't wrong"
"No one has ever escaped
the passion"
"So what if we have kissed?"
"So what if we have made love?
We are one at heart"
"It's just that this has happened
for the first time in our lives"
"But being in love isn't wrong"
"I am mature"
"You are mature too"
"We'll lead the life
we choose to live"
"Why listen to them who
don't mean anything to us?"
"Being in love isn't wrong"
"What is custom?
What is tradition?"
"What is religion?
What is society?"
"Don't be afraid of your enemies
Don't be shy to tell your friends"
"No one has ever escaped
the passion"
"Being in love isn't wrong"
I've won one more cup, Dad!
Well done! Congratulations!
There's more goods news.
- Go on, son.
I'm in love.
Bravo, you jerk!
Who's the girl?
What's the matter, sir?
You look elated.
Matter to be elated over!
My son is in love!
After all, he's your son!
- Right! My son!
I send him away for studying,
and this jerk falls in love!
Let's talk business. Where are
you constructing the hotel?
Near Shyam Nagar. At present
there's no 5-star hotel there.
Has work commenced?
- Yes.
But it's up in the mountains.
It'll take time to complete.
Your hotels in Delhi and Bombay
drive people crazy!
Now, why does a person
go to a hotel?
Because he wants to do something
without telling his or her spouse.
Just walk into a hotel,
and you'll think...
you've just walked into
a lingerie show.
Excuse me, I have to go
and see this bore.
Get on with the good work.
I'll see you at the site
when I get some free time.
I can't say when, though.
This is a neat racket,
Doctor Kapoor.
I've built this house out of reading
this baumanometer.
Just a gimmick to get
the rich man's goat.
There are simpler ways
to treat this.
Now let me say hi to your wife.
Say it straight. You want a drink.
- You're getting smarter. Keep it up.
Stop boring me.
And you must be getting late?
Funny doctors pretend
they don't drink.
Hey Shobha! Where are you?
Anybody at home?
Hi there. Sit down.
What this you're watching?
Even I can do that.
Look here.
Today is a Wednesday.
Pooja is coming on tv.
I thought I escaped Pooja!
And here she is! Boring!
If you don't want to watch it,
make yourself a drink.
The whisky is over there.
Suit myself!
I heard about the great Delhi
hospitality.
No reaction?
Come on Vijay Khanna,
help yourself.
Today we introduce to you Mr Amit
the famous poet.
He's my favourite!
Ms Pooja, you must give the audience
my greetings.
Which you have said
and they have heard.
I believe they will be glad
to have this introduction.
What next after "Kabhi Kabhie"?
"Kabhi Kabhie" was my first
and perhaps my last anthology.
Meaning?
Years ago, I stopped writing poetry.
What is a life without
poetry, art and music?
How can you live such
a dry, drab and lonely life?
That's the life I'm living.
But I'll assure you it isn't
an existence without purpose.
Love, it is said is what makes
a man write his first lines.
Or maybe love is what impels a man
to stop writing poetry.
But tell me, is this hearsay?
Or is it a personal opinion?
The audience is still waiting
for your answer.
I have said what I have to.
And those who can, will understand.
On behalf of the viewers
and myself, I will ask you...
to start writing once again.
For our sake.
And now that we are here, how about
reading one of your poems?
You might have heard my
poem titled "Kabhi Kabhie".
Yes.
I have heard it.
I have read it too.
"Kabhi Kabhie" is one facet
of my life.
Long before that,
I had written another poem...
which reveals the other side
of my life.
Here it is...
"Sometimes
My heart tells me"
"Life could've passed in
The shade of your long tresses then"
"The sorrows
That burden my heart today"
"In your eyes would
have found solace"
"But that was not to be
And such is how it is"
"Not you, nor your desire,
Nor the pangs are"
"Life drags on as if
Life needs no support anymore"
"There is no path, no destination
No light upon my path..."
"Through darkness my life meanders
In this darkness, my way I will lose"
"This I know will come to be, my love"
"But still
Sometimes, my heart tells me"
"Sometimes, my heart tells me"
It has been so many years.
Yes. Many years.
I've started losing count.
Come, let's go somewhere.
I have so much to tell you.
Yes. I want to listen to everything
you have to say.
Caught you red handed!
I'm smart too.
Very pleased to meet you.
Long before I became her husband,
I became your fan.
Did you tell him about
our first night together?
I asked her to sing
one of your poems.
You know, Pooja sings very well!
She's also your fan.
Mr Amit...
- Yes?
I have a small request.
- Tell me.
Come to my house and
join me for a drink.
I'd be very happy. Pooja would
be happy too. Yes, Pooja?
If that's so important,
well let's do it.
It's coke for you isn't it, Pooja?
Come on, why don't you take
a drink at times?
I've taken up a lot of good habits
from you. Spare me this one.
Ever since she married me, she has
been getting smarter and smarter.
What's your opinion?
- I haven't one.
It's a matter between
husband and wife.
You aren't an outsider.
Our relationship is very old.
I've known you for years.
As a poet.
But Pooja, you missed something
in that interview.
Missed?
- Yes.
You never said anything
about Mr Amit's poetry.
There's pathos in his every line.
The pangs of love...
as if he was scarred.
At least you could've asked him
who she was.
Not your fault, you know.
You didn't fall in love.
You don't know the lover's plight.
That poem of yours...
"Sometimes if we cross paths
You will pretend not to know me"
"Sometimes when my name is mentioned
You will feign ignorance"
"Of me? You have never heard"
"Sometimes if we cross paths
You will pretend not to know me"
"Sometimes when my name is mentioned
You will feign ignorance"
"Of me? You have never heard"
Look, I don't build houses,
I build homes.
And walls and doors and windows
don't make homes.
It takes people to make homes.
How they think, how they feel,
how they live their lives...
and the people who visit their homes
...their friends, their foes...
The house they live in,
pictures what they are.
It means, a man's status is
revealed from his residence.
See me in my office on Monday.
I'll give you the details.
Where's Mr Amit?
- He has left.
Without as much as telling me?
These poets are really moody.
Looks like he has suffered.
That question during the interview
was a good one.
That girl has ruined his life.
All you men think alike. In the end,
it's the woman who gets all the blame.
Men are selfish. We never even think
what the woman has to go through.
By the way, your son called.
- Anything special?
Very special!
- What?
Is that why he called?
- You don't know this, Pooja.
When I first fell in love,
I wanted to tell everyone!
Whenever I was alone, I used to scream
at the top of my voice, "I'm in love"
Not over and over and over again...
Look, over there.
Such a beautiful place!
For ages, the mountains have
stood here. In silence.
As if they've been waiting
all this while for us.
And the golden sun lying
on the snow over there.
And the trees standing like
hermits worshipping nature...
And you don't even
seem to notice.
"I can't take my eyes off you"
"Nature's beauty means nothing to me"
"My desire isn't sated yet"
"Nature's beauty means nothing to me"
"Your eyes burns with desire"
"Like the fire upon snows"
"My body is on fire"
"Nature's beauty means nothing to me"
"There lies a sea of colors
and fragrances"
"But we don't even know
if it's the day or the night"
"A whole Universe
I can feel within myself"
"Nature's beauty means nothing to me"
"I see the shadow of my eye-lids
in your eyes"
"In your face I can see
my emotions mirrored"
"I have never had enough of you"
"I always crave to meet you...
Goodbye kiss!
I'll call you.
- I'll wait.
What are you gaping at?
- The scene.
Keep going.
- Sure.
Where's Papa?
- Inside.
Inside?
Is Pinky home?
Pinky...? No.
But I just heard her voice.
An illusion, maybe?
- Very strange.
Give yourself a treatment, doctor.
Pinky my baby!
Where's my tape recorder?
Shut your eyes...
- Done.
Now say, "Open Sesame"
Open Sesame
- Louder.
Here comes your tape recorder.
Keep yourselves company.
I've a lot of work to do.
I'll cook up a sweet and...
potato in sour sauce.
Right?
Your coming has brightened up
our lives!
Without you this house
looked so empty.
I'll never leave you.
- But you'll have.
Why?
- Someone will marry you someday.
Isn't it possible to I bring home
the man I marry?
You mad girl, go to your
room and change.
My patients are waiting.
Ramdeen, Govind where
the hell are you?
Come up here
Can't you hear me?
What happened sweetheart?
- Everything is in a mess!
Who removed my photograph
from here? Who came in here?
Your father used to come
to your room.
He missed you.
He comes here and
sits here for hours.
He fiddles with your things.
He took your photograph.
It's on the table by his bed.
He kisses the photo every night
before he goes to bed.
My baby, I can't live without you.
Yes, it's me.
What are you up to?
- Nothing.
When are you seeing me?
- I just left you.
Can I come over?
- Why?
I can't take my eyes off you.
Go on...
- Buddy, so when are we meeting?
Eleven tomorrow?
Are you on grass or something?
Just came in from the garden.
Yes. Daddy is here.
And he's fine.
He's in his room making plans
for a new house. For us.
So Daddy's breathing down your neck?
Scared of Daddy?
Not at all.
Eleven sharp tomorrow, then?
On one condition.
- What?
Not now, man!
Look, at times, a man is helpless!
Try to understand.
Then I won't come.
Now don't do this.
Eleven tomorrow, right?
No...
- Pinky, please man...
In my time, I've had
my share of flings.
This is just your first time.
Dad, just you wait and watch.
As if you've won the the cup
for the greatest casanova.
Call it my jackpot in the derby.
Who's this girl? Tell me.
Making friends with Dad
could be profitable.
She's from your part of the world.
- From Delhi? And I don't know her?
She's in school with me.
Her father is a doctor.
Dr R.P. Kapoor
You mean my doctor's daughter?
Made my day!
Didn't I say, my son will show
his colors someday!
You fool! Did you hear that?
Your son is in love with
my doctor's daughter.
What?
Look he's feeling shy.
Come, let's launch the attack!
I had warned him to take care
of his daughter. Let's go.
But in this state...?
- What do you mean?
Let me change my dress.
What for? For impressing people?
I've been impressed for years!
What are you laughing at you jackass?
She's your mother!
Come on, pick her up.
- What are you doing?
Was that an important caller?
Yes... a friend, she came along
with me from the hostel.
And you like her a lot?
- Yes.
Ever since we've met, it's
as though, we're in love...
It happens doesn't it Dad?
You meet someone for the first time...
and you get involved for a lifetime.
It happens, especially
to people your age.
What's his name?
- What?
You're caught.
Won't you tell us
your girlfriend's name?
Hey Doctor, come out man!
Doctor, didn't I say my son
will show his colors someday?
Colors...?
With your permission?
God bless you.
Let me take a look at you.
Shobha she looks just like you.
You used to be my friend's wife.
The relationship is changing.
Henceforth our relations
have changed.
I have a right to flirt with you
from now on. Right, doctor?
With Pooja's permission.
As if he needs permission.
He's the father of a grown-up son,
and look at him.
Still up to childish pranks.
- I'm young at heart!
Come into my arms, Shobha!
What are you doing? You're wet!
Fatty, I'll fix you!
Who is it on your mind? Dad kissed
you before he left, didn't he?
Shall I ask you something?
- Ask.
When you were in college,
there must've been...
an ambulance trailing behind you.
- Meaning...?
I mean, men must've been fainting
left and right.
Apple-polishing, is this?
Shut up.
You must've liked someone.
Else you wouldn't be humming.
Look, don't tell lies.
Tell me the truth.
Those were the days in college.
Those days are gone.
But we weren't like you.
You meet a girl in the morning,
and by evening, you're engaged.
In your times, people went platonic
for six months!
For a year afterwards, hello's,
how-are-you's and niceties.
By the time you get to start
a relationship...
she gets to know that her parents
have fixed her wedding elsewhere.
Which leaves the poor Romeo
to play uncle to Juliet's baby.
Pinky looks so happy.
She's very lucky.
The boy is so nice.
And it's a good family.
What are you thinking about?
She's going to get engaged.
And then, comes the wedding.
Don't worry. I've put together
a dowry for Pinky.
I'm her mother. I know my duty.
I'm not talking about that.
- Then what is it?
Look, Pinky's in-law's
live in the same city.
In a way that's good.
We can keep seeing here.
That's just why the secret
can longer be kept a secret.
What secret?
You know fully well. But you'd
rather have me speak about it.
I don't know any secret.
- We shouldn't be selfish.
I can understand, how painful
it's going to be for you.
But we should make
a clean breast of it.
Have you ever thought
where this is going to end?
Even I'm scared when
I think about it.
But how long can we keep it a secret?
Besides, the Khannas are our friends.
When they come to know,
we'll lose face.
Then why are you asking me?
Go and keep up your face.
You always get your way with things.
Do whatever you want.
I knew long ago that Pinky
could never be your daughter!
You're such a bore and
she's such a sweet girl.
We're the bridespeople, after all.
You have the upper hand. Go on.
I won't let you off lightly.
We don't measure people...
by labels and families.
It's the heart that counts.
Am I right Pooja?
He wants my opinion?
Don't you let go of your chance.
I need someone to second me.
Besides, you're my wife.
Will you ever speak against me?
- Sure. That's what wives are for.
I think you should
tell Pinky everything.
Are you out of your mind?
Pooja, you don't know Pinky.
I don't think it's a good idea
to tell her.
The earlier we learn to
trust our children, the better.
Tomorrow they shouldn't blame
us for cooking up things.
When a child falls,
he bruises himself.
If the child was pushed,
the wound could run deep.
Today, Pinky is a girl.
Tomorrow, she will become a woman.
She might never forgive us.
This is not true! Tell me Papa
that I'm your daughter!
Pinky my child, I...
- I'm my Mama's baby! Tell me!
Yes! You're our daughter, dear.
Our darling daughter.
Then why did you say that
I have another mother?
I don't have another Mom.
Even if it were true...
you should never have told me.
- I told him, but he insisted.
Shobha, we shouldn't be selfish.
If it's selfishness
to be a mother...
if it's selfishness to crave
for a daughter's love...
then I'd rather be
be a selfish woman.
Pinky my child...
how long could we have
kept this a secret?
After the wedding, when the documents
relating to your inheritance...
are handed over to you,
the truth would surely out.
Your natural mother is still alive.
We are your foster parents.
All of a sudden,
there comes up a name.
A name that never concerned me.
Someone I was never related to.
And today, she's my mother.
I have become her daughter.
But what difference does
it make?
A lot of difference!
You pick up a plant
you have cared for...
you pull it out by the roots,
you throw it away...
and you say that it makes no
difference to you!
It will kill the plant!
It will kill me!
I forgot it. I'm not Pinky's mother.
I've forgotten it for years!
And today...
What difference does it make?
She deserted you
after you were born.
And today, she means
so much for you?
And those who gave you all their
love... they mean nothing to you?
What do I do? Today I hesitate even
to ask for a cup of tea in that house.
To think that I used
to throw a tantrum...
every time I wasn't given
what I wanted.
When I didn't like the food,
I'd smash the plates.
But today, I haven't
the guts to say a word.
Great! This is how you
pay your parents back!
Is this how you repay
their love for you?
Just because somewhere there's
a woman who gave birth to you.
So that's why she's your Mother.
Why rake up the past?
What've you got to do with her?
Listen to me.
Forget the story.
This is not a story.
There is someone.
She bore me.
She is my mother.
You know what the word mother means?
This one word has changed my life.
She has snatched my family away!
What about our love, the wedding,
our life together?
I can't say anything now.
- Or you don't want to?
Please, Vicky.
Try to understand me.
I don't even know why my
mother deserted me.
What was her problem?
I don't even know who my Dad is.
I wish to know about myself.
Why don't you understand?
What do you want to do?
- I'll meet my mother.
Then?
- What do you mean?
I mean, what after that?
- This I can't tell now.
Because you don't know?
- Yes.
When do you wish to go?
- As soon as possible.
Very well. We'll both
go and see your mother.
You aren't coming with me.
- Why?
Because this is a personal matter.
Am I an outsider?
- I didn't say that.
Alone! In a strange place!
Among strange people...!
I can take care of myself.
- But I'm coming with you.
Where have you been all morning?
Have you had a drink before?
- Beer.
Only one peg.
Had a fight with Pinky?
What's the problem, son?
What difference would it have made
had God not created woman?
You wouldn't have been born.
God has created woman so that
you can grow up and abuse her.
You're becoming indecent
day by day.
I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about Pinky.
She picked a fight with me,
and she walked out on me.
Where has she gone?
- To find her newfound mother.
And you let her go?
To a strange place...
to meet strangers...?
What if in a weak moment,
she does something wrong?
What else could I do?
I told her, I'm ready
to go with her.
But she screamed at me!
And she said no one goes with her.
She says a no, and you drop the idea?
And you're madly in love with her?
Don't call my love mad, Dad!
Be a man!
If you love her, then follow
her to the end of the world.
Bring her back.
Prove that you're my son.
Vicky, where are you going?!
Ask him where he's going.
Don't you want your son
to know his responsibilities?
Let him make his own decisions.
Let him stand on his own feet.
Yes?
My name is Pinky.
I'm coming from Delhi.
From Dr Kapoor's...
Who is it, Anju?
Who is this?
My niece.
Your uncle.
How did you come alone?
Weren't you afraid of taking
such a long journey all alone?
No news. And no letter.
You could've sent us a telegram.
She might've decided
on the spur of the moment.
I'm seeing you after years.
I couldn't recognise you.
You wouldn't even remember me.
You were very small then.
Come, I'll show you
to your room.
This is your room. Take a bath.
The bathroom is there.
Take a hot water bath.
You'll feel fresh.
I'll lay the table
in the meantime.
What's her name?
Pinky
Why has she come here?
Why does one come to visit
a relative?
And what did you say
your cousin's name is?
Mrs Shobha Kapoor
Strange, isn't it? A strange face,
a strange name you never heard of...
comes knocking, and tells you,
let's play relatives.
Even I was surprised to see her.
- So I thought.
She's your cousin
from Delhi.
Papa, isn't she sweet?
Come, sit here.
Let Pinky sit beside me.
Come Pinky.
Start, Pinky.
Come on, let me serve you.
Pass the bowl, Sweety.
How was your day?
Invite me sometime for the game.
Don't you play any games?
- Sometimes.
How about a match between
Pinky and Sweety?
I'm not losing a match.
Won't you back me up, Papa?
And I'll back Pinky.
Not one to hundred.
One to a thousand!
Come to me, my child.
- What's it Papa?
I'll show you a cartoon.
Looks just like you.
I don't want to see it.
- Why are you angry with me?
Show me all your teeth. Let's see
how you look when you smile.
Papa, will you recite that poem?
- Which one?
The one you had written about me
when I was very small.
Let your Mummy recite that poem.
Anjali...
Recite that poem...
- All right.
Come and sit beside me.
"A little fairy came to my house"
"She came riding on a chariot
lit with the moonlight"
"Her words were as sweet
as honey"
"On her breath, the smell of perfumes"
"Her lips were like wet roses"
"Her cheeks were the color of
ripe pomegranates"
"That was the little fairy
who came to my house"
"When she came,
the spring came with her"
"And flowers blossomed
in my house"
"I have seen her a thousand times"
"But I can't take my eyes off her"
"She's the little fairy
who came to my house"
"Then I asked her
Who are you?"
"She smiled and said
I'm your love"
"I've lived in your heart forever"
"This is the first time
I've come to your home"
"She's the little fairy
who came to my house"
"She came riding on a chariot
lit with the moonlight"
What a beautiful poem!
You write so well.
Why don't you write a poem
about Pinky?
Why about Pinky?
He's my Papa.
He'll write about me.
He won't write about anyone else!
Not even about you!
You shouldn't talk like
that before a guest.
Who is she?
I cannot tell you yet
who you are.
How long will she stay in our house?
How long can I hide this?
It's just a matter of a few days.
She isn't going to stay here forever.
The way Mummy was looking at her!
As if she's loathe to leave her!
Why did you leave me?
As of now, you will not understand.
Neither can I explain this.
Our well-wishers purport to act
in the best of our interests.
I've suffered for it.
I haven't seen my daughter
in 20 years...
the daughter I bore.
In life, these petty event
come and go.
One who understands and
adjusts accordingly, is wise.
May I call you my mother?
No.
Not yet.
Vicky you? Here?
Your tears tell me that you've been
crying your heart out for me.
Aren't my eyes telling you something?
At least you can do me the courtesy...
of asking if I've had
a pleasant journey.
Vicky, I'm very disturbed.
So you've met your mother,
haven't you?
You shouldn't have come here.
Now that you're here,
make sure you don't meet me.
Even if we meet, make sure
you don't recognise me.
I have a past and you know that.
But there's no place in it for you.
Don't you rub it in!
I didn't come here to
enjoy myself.
Watch this!
