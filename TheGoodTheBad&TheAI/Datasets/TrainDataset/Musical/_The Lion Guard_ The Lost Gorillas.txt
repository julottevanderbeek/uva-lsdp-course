Careful, Bunga...
It's a very delicate situation!
Sorry, Zazu.
Can't understand ya with
your beak in that beehive.
Thank you, Bunga!
That's much...
Gotcha covered, Zazu!
Gracious!
Maybe next time try
flying under the beehive,
not through it!
Yes. Thank you, Bunga.
So why were you in such a hurry?
I was looking for you.
All of you!
What's the kerbubble, Zazu?
I've just received word.
The pangolins are
spraying everywhere!
It's quite a stinky situation.
Odd. Pangolins only spray
when they're threatened.
Then we better check it out.
My thoughts precisely!
Till the Pride Lands' end...
ALL: Lion Guard defend!
PANGOLINS:  Help! Help!
Sounds like we're close. Ugh.
Smells like we're close.
ALL: Huh?
I'm sorry.
Can anyone tell me
what I'm looking at?
No idea.
Drop it, Majinuni!
You drop it, Hafifu!
This one's a real stinker!
I know you are, but what is it?
Those're the biggest
baboons I've ever seen!
I don't think they're baboons.
Ugh. They sure act like baboons.
I've never seen
anyone like them.
And I know every animal
in the Pride Lands.
Well, whatever they are,
they need to leave
those pangolins alone!
KION: Hey! You two!
Put down the pangolins!
Put them down?
But they're so much
fun to squeeze!
They are!
Squeezy! Squeezy! Squeezy!
KION: No!
Oh, hello! Have we met?
Would you mind
not standing on us?
Sure.
If you promise to stop
messing with the pangolins.
- Deal! - Deal!
Oh look! You've
brought some friends!
What fun!
So, who are you?
And what are you doing
in the Pride Lands?
Ah, well, that's easy.
I'm Majinuni, and this
is my brother Hafifu.
We're looking for someone
called King Zimba.
He's a "lion"?
I think they mean Simba.
Yes! That's right!
Do you know him?
Yeah, you could say that.
Kion here just happens
to be his son.
You're a lion?
You're a prince?
- So are we!
- So are we!
Wait. You guys are lions?
No, they're princes!
Seriously?
No wonder we've got
so much in common!
We do?
Our poppa sent us here with
a message for your poppa!
A really important message!
Kion, there is no way anyone sent these
two with a message for the king.
Look at 'em!
Majinuni, look!
A stick!
Excuse me? A what?
- Bet you can't hit that baobab fruit.
- Bet you I can!
No, wait!
Stop. Stop!
I am not a stick! I am a snake!
Every time I get near
the Lion Guard...
Hafifu! Why'd you do that?
Uh, 'cause I wanted
to throw the stick.
Ushari's not a stick!
You just heard him say so!
Uh, he's got a point.
As a rule, sticks don't talk.
Ah. Oh, well.
What does that mean?
It's our motto!
It means, "To live is to laugh!"
You know...
Right?
Uh, nope.
Don't know that one.
They've never heard of it.
How could they never
have heard of it?
Maybe we should sing it
in a different key...
That won't be necessary.
Look. I'll take you to my dad
so you can give him
your message.
Now come on. Walk this way.
These gorilla-dillas
are my kinda guys!
KION: Uh, Dad...
This is probably going
to sound weird...
What is it, son?
Well, we've found these gorilla
brothers who say they...
Have a message for me?
Yes. You know them?
Their father is King Sokwe
of the Mountain Gorillas.
A long time ago, he and
I made a peace treaty.
Now, every wet season,
he sends a message
to let me know
if he still agrees to the peace.
Or not.
So...
Majinuni and Hafifu really do have
an important message for you?
Very important.
Where are they?
They're coming.
Ooh! Yeah!
ALL:
Aw, hey, Your Highness!
Lemme introduce these guys...
Majinuni. Hafifu.
You have a message for me?
Yes, um, about that...
We do have a message...
Er, we did, but...
Boys?
- He forgot it!
- He forgot it!
Why am I not surprised?
I see.
This is not good.
I need you and the Lion Guard
to take the boys back home
and find out what
King Sokwe's message is.
Can't you just send them back
and get the message again?
And let peace with the
gorillas depend on them?
I bet I can stand on
one foot longer than you.
So? Bet you can't
hop on one foot
while patting your nose
and rubbing your belly.
Got it.
Where's their home?
SIMBA: The Theluji Mountains.
Wow!
That's a long way off.
Yes, but King Sokwe's sons
should know the way.
Okay, now let's see who can
balance longer on no legs!
I hope.
FULI: Please tell me
we're almost there.
We are!
We just have to go up the
mountain and find King Sokwe.
Majinuni, Hafifu.
Can you tell us
where your dad is?
Oh, you know...
Up there somewhere.
You guys really don't know
how to get home from here?
Sorry. We've never gone
up the mountain before.
To tell the truth, we've only
gone down the mountain once.
Yeah, and we rolled
most of the way at that!
Ono? Where to next?
I see a path through the trees!
Great. Then we'll go that way.
Thanks for the help.
Well,
she certainly is polite.
I know, right? I didn't think
we were helpful at all.
Guys?
Any of this look familiar?
Not to me.
I think he was talking
to the gorillas.
Did you say gorillas?
Are there gorillas
here somewhere?
Is Poppa here?
Uh, Poppa?
I was talking to you!
You're the gorillas!
Oh!
Pfft!
We are the gorillas.
- We're the gorillas!
- We're the gorillas!
And until we get them home,
they're our gorillas.
Yeah...
So which way do we go from here?
- That way!
- That way!
- No, no! That way!
- No, no! That way!
Maybe we can ask
this little green guy.
What little green guy?
He was green a second ago!
He must be a chameleon!
A ka-what-eon?
A chameleon!
A lizard that can
change his colors!
Did you hear that, brother?
I heard that, brother!
BOTH: Chameleon hide and seek!
No, wait! Come back!
MAJINUNI:
I'm gonna find it.
HAFIFU:
No, I'm gonna find it!
Ono? Please follow them.
On it!
Hafifu! Majinuni!
HAFIFU: Hello!
Where are you?
HAFIFU: Excellent question!
Wish we could say!
MAJINUNI: It is
a bit of a puzzler!
We can hear you,
but we can't see you!
Ono?
Sorry, Kion...
The plants are too thick.
I can't even see the ground!
You smell 'em?
Too many weird plants in bloom.
I don't think I could even
track Bunga's scent here.
Yeah, me neither.
Hmm...
Hafifu! Majinuni!
Stay still!
When I call your names,
shout back.
We'll follow your voices
and find you!
HAFIFU: Ooh, yes!
But let's make it a game!
You shout
then we shout
Fine.
MAJINUNI: Oh, it's our turn.
Sounds like they're this way.
Right. Let's go!
KION:
MAJINUNI:
Now it sounds like
they're back there.
Hafifu!
Majinuni!
This game isn't working!
Then let's change the game!
BOTH: Forest hog chase!
Brilliant!
Lion Guard!
We shall now snort like forest
hogs while you chase us!
Chase them? Seriously?
I don't even know what
forest hogs sound like.
Now you do!
I see trees moving!
I think
they're heading uphill...
Right into the fog!
Okay. Thanks, Ono!
KION: Let's go!
Majinuni! Hafifu!
That snort came from behind us.
You think the gorillas split up?
ONO: Or it might
possibly be a...
...real forest hog!
Hey, listen!
They're doing hog snorts, too!
I'm glad they're getting
into the spirit of the...
...forest hog!
Did you say the spirit
of the forest hog?
Ah! Forest hog!
The forest hog! It's after them!
FULI: Wait for us!
Why's the hog acting so mad?
He must think the gorillas
are other forest hogs!
Hogging in on his territory!
Get it?
Forest hog... Hogging? Ah?
Bunga!
Back off of the gorillas!
You can't get to them
without going through me.
And you're not
getting through me.
FULI: Or us!
Okay, then.
Hafifu? Majinuni?
You okay?
Uh, surprisingly enough, we are.
Totally unpoked by
sharp hoggy tusks!
You saved us!
Well, sure.
That's what we do.
Now let's get you home.
I've got a better idea.
Let's get chased by
the forest hog again!
What? Seriously?
Guys? Is something
else going on?
Well, we haven't been very helpful
getting you to our poppa...
Because we don't really
want to see him.
I knew something was going on!
You couldn't be that silly.
Oh, no. We are.
Totally silly! Dozy!
Dopey! Wacky!
Immature and frivolous.
That's a lot of words for silly.
Okay. So tell me.
Why don't you want
to see your dad?
For some reason he's never
thought we're prince material.
So we decided to
show him he's wrong.
We volunteered to deliver his
really important message.
And then we failed miserably.
Now we have to go
home and tell him.
- He's going to put on his...
- BOTH: Disappointed face.
- I get it.
- BOTH: You do?
I never want to let
down my dad either.
It's the whole reason I'm here.
I'm really sorry.
I wish I could do something
to make it easier.
Well, you did face down
a ferocious forest hog.
That's almost as hard
as facing our dad.
And it seemed like the sort
of thing a prince would do.
We don't exactly
feel like princes yet...
Trust me. If you act
like a prince,
sooner or later, you'll start
to feel like a prince.
Okay, then.
We'll take you to our home.
Great! Possibly one
last little game?
LION GUARD: No!
All right. This way.
Not much farther...
BOTH: Whee!
FULI: What is this?
ONO: I...
I don't know.
Me neither.
But I like it.
Betcha never seen snow before!
Snow? Huh.
What do you do with it?
Do? You have fun!
Hey!
Whoo!
Come on!
You just going to stand there,
or are you going to play?
Kion?
Well... I guess a little
fun couldn't hurt.
Oh! All right!
It's cold.
And slippery!
But it's kinda fun!
I want to try.
It's melting on my beak!
Kion, you've got to try this!
It's un-Bunga-lievable!
I don't know, guys.
We should be careful
with this stuff.
We don't know enough about it.
You know it can do this!
Oh, it's on.
Some may say that
life's a joke
Cause if you live life
with a frown
Happiness is
all around you now
Just one phrase
to show you how
Happiness is all
around you now
Just one phrase
to show you how
That's not
to throw at me, is it?
Nah! It's a souvenir
for Uncle Timon.
I could do this all day.
Us too!
But we promised
we'd get you to our dad.
Yeah.
I just want to take one more
look, so I'll never forget it.
Whoa! Guys? Guys!
ALL: Kion!
Whoa!
I'm coming, Kion!
Sorry for the quick-stop, Bunga.
But Kion needs someone
who knows the mountain.
Two someones!
BOTH:
Ono! Follow Kion! On it!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
See you at the bottom, brother!
You'll see
my bottom, brother!
'Cause I'll get to Kion first!
Whoa!
Argh!
Look at me!
I'm flying!
Ooh! Chilly!
Kion? Are you okay?
So far!
But I can't hang on long!
Not helping, Ono!
Sorry!
Whoo-hoo!
Hang on, Kion!
Good advice, brother!
I can't look!
You saved me.
Thanks.
Pfft! No thanks needed.
It was fun!
Oh no! It was more than that.
It was brave.
Doing something like that
is what you makes you
prince material.
You really think
we have that in us?
The prince thing?
Totally.
SOKWE: So...
You forgot my message
to King Simba!
BOTH: Yes, Poppa.
And you got lost coming home
from the Pride Lands!
BOTH: Yes, Poppa.
And you needed the Lion Guard
to help you get back home!
BOTH: Yes, Poppa.
You know what this means.
BOTH: Yes, Poppa.
What do
you think it means?
Nothing too bad, I hope.
SOKWE: Kion told me
how you saved him.
I'm proud of you both.
You are true gorilla princes.
BOTH: Thank you, Poppa.
Um, speaking of your
message for my dad?
We do need to give it to him.
Of course you do.
I see your friend has
a souvenir from our home.
Sure do!
Uh... Your Gorilla-ness!
Is that's a problem?
No, no.
Not at all.
In fact, it's perfect.
KION: And, so...
Here we are.
And did you bring back
King Sokwe's message?
Uh, yeah...
Well, then?
It's just...
Kion? I need the message.
Are you sure?
Yes! You have to give it to me!
Okay...
Sorry, Your Majesty.
It really wasn't my idea.
This
might have been a mistake.
Oh, King Sokwe.
No one delivers a peace
message like him.
