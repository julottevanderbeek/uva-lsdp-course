Great! What a man!
He is not a man, he is a whirlwind
Come fast, very, very fast
Mr. Raja, who is this boy?
He is our most faithful dog
If I measure the faithfulness
of all my dogs, he will win
Well done!
Well done, Shankar, you are great
Of course. He has a lion's heart
Who put it in his chest?
Who made him a man of steel?
Bloody fool! It's Raja Saheb!
Raja Saheb, Raja Saheb,
disaster has struck!
The men have stopped working
in the coal mines
Why? Is there a fire in the mines?
The fire is in your brother's mind
He is beating up one of the men
very badly
Please don't beat my father
Please let him go. He will die.
Please don't beat my father
Halt!
What is this, Birjwa?
Brother, she was going by...
I fancied her, so I grabbed her hand
That's all.
Oh, Raja Saheb, why are you being
so harsh with your brother?
He has always been like this,
right from childhood.
You shut up!
Listen carefully, Birjwa, the daughters
of these men are like our own
I am the King and these are my subjects
There's a God above
but I am their God on earth
Go away, Bloody fool!
Great! I have witnessed the
justice of the Court of Jehangir
Slapped by his own brother
When Birjwa was slapped,
it was my heart that bled
Yeah, if you think I lie...
... then may the village mad dog bite er,
er, anyone!
I am doing plain talking
Hail the great Raja Saheb!
Ladies and gentlemen, I am Mr. Tol Mol
I talk in riddles,
but lay bare deep secrets
What the hell are you talking about?
I am recounting the history
of this village
For ages men have been bying women here
See that old man? See where he is going
He is giving medicine to all the old men
to turn them young
What a rascal!
What's that he is saying?
Father, he is telling us your real name
You are a fool, and
I am the son of a fool
Why the hell are you wasting your life
fooling around whit that puppet?
Look how I am pursuing
our ancestral trade
You are cheating the rich people
Please try to make my husband
more virile
Increase his virility?
It means that the pill you gave him
last time had no effect
Yes, that is true
But this time I will give you
such a medicine that
Father, why are you ruining their lives?
No, no. I am re-kindling his fire
What you are trying to do is
to set alight wood that is damp
You'll get nothing but smoke
Why?
Because, Father, you are trying to
play a guitar that has no strings
Are his strings broken?
The whole instrument is broken, Father
And this model will not work
Am I right, sister?
Yes, you are right
I have been taken for a ride
Hey, have you had any refreshments,
or are you just talking away?
I will see to his eating,
you look after his drinking
Shankar
Give me the tray
Friends, the Court is ready
but where is the King?
Master, what is this?
You were the cause of
my beating my own brother
I will now give you the same thrashing
But, Master, your brother
teases our daughters...
Shut up, son of a bitch
Your children become our slaves
the moment they are conceived
We can do what we like with them
Your wives and daughters...
... we can use them any way we like
They are our property
We will raise our voice against this,
yes we will
Throw him to the dogs
What are you doing here?
What did you see?
You didn't see anything!
Tell me, what did you see?
What, what did you see?
What did you see, eh?
Birjwa. What is it?
He has seen something, but won't say
Hey, does coal ever talk?
Does the mountain talk?
You need a voice to be able to talk
Where will this dink get a voice from,
he is dumb
I know that, but he has seen something
You may ask him!
Shankar
Birjwa, I may be illiterate
but I have been reading this mute
from his childhood
I can tell, he has not seen anything
Go, Shankar, go!
Good party, wonderful party,
wonderful party
You have had to much to drink
I have drunk a lot of wine
but now I must drink from
the fountain of your youth
You always say this when you're drunk
Bindiya darling, the Creator made you
so beautiful
Why then do you cover your
beautiful body?
Throw away your clothes
I will appreciate your beauty
One would think this was the
first time you were seeing it
That's it! The miracle of God
Oh, damn you, Guard
I am right in the middle of the road
and you are shooting bullets at me
Raja Saheb has given us orders to shoot
Raja Saheb cannto live without the
pellets that I give him,
but your bullets,
were they to hit me by any chance
then you've had it
Even if you escape Raja,
Birjwa will definitely kill you.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Raja Saheb, Raja Saheb, Raja Saheb,
Why are you shouting?
You have no enemies,
then why all these guards and
bullets and dogs?
Listen, grass and enmity can grow
anywhere and at any time
After all I am the King
so I must have some target
The Deputy Inspector is on the line
Yes, Inspector, what is it?
You are coming, aren't you?
I will certainly be there
for your daughter's wedding
Don't worry
Wunnerful, my friend, wunnerfool!
It's wonderful, not wunnerfool
Yeah, that's what I said, didn't I!
What is the matter, Raja Saheb?
You seem to have lost out to her today?
It is all your fault
You gave me such medicine that
I failed once again last night
Once again I was humiliated
It is not the fault of the medicine
Whose fault is it then?
It is the fault of the model
At this age where can I find
a better model?
Just open your eyes and look around
God has made many beautiful models
Listen, Gauri, I was...!
Hey, Gauri, what have you people done!
Eaten sweets, that's what
Those were laced with cannabis!
There will be a heap of trouble
Is that so? What a disaster!
You will not be able to look straight
That is what is happening
You will become intoxicated
We have become intoxicated!
Stop!
Water!
Look what is happening!
Milk is flowing from the tap!
Whoa! Stop the Jeep!
Hey, what are you waving your hands for?
Blow the horn
Hey, you there, you girl
Not "you there", but Gauri,
that is my name
Gauri, the beloved of the moon
Gauri, Gauri, the beloved of the moon!
Hey you, move aside
Why, what for?
Because you are sitting in the
middle of the road, that's why
We are not sitting on the road,
the road has spread itself under us
This girl looks mad to me
What did you say? You called Gauri
mad? You called me mad?
Just say that once again, say it,
I dare you
You curved moustached man
Moustached!
What are you staring at me for, with
your wide open eyes you, Old Man?
Old Man?
He is not an old man, he is Rajaji
Dadaji ?
Friends, come and greet our grandfather
Namaste, dadaji, namaste!
Gauri, hey, Gauri!
You have made my life unbearable
You are forever in trouble
Come, come on home, come along
Let me go, let go, please
Ahh, what a sight for sore eyes!
What a piece!
You have also become naughty
with these children
Hey, not what a piece, she`s a big piece
She's more like a buffalow
What?
Her waist is the size of a barrel
Dolt. I am not talking about
the big woman,
I am talking about the little one
Beautiful, beautiful!
Why are you laughing?
You have grown up but still
as playful as a child
When will you get some
sense in your head?
When I have not lost it, the question of
getting it back doesn't arise
Your parents died without
leaving a penny...
and saddled us with an orphan daughter
And your brother too
just dumped you on my head...
... while he enjoys himself in Dubai
Listen, Auntie. Don't say one word
against him
It's the money he sends every month
which runs this house
Or we would have all starved
Enough, now go get dressed,
we have to attend a wedding
Raja Saheb! Welcome, Raja Saheb
I didn't think you would remember
non entities like us
You came as an Inspector
to this area, but
retired as the
Deputy Inspector General of Police
How can I forget such a big man?
I was...!
What a piece!
Beautiful! Wonderful!
O Raja Saheb. Times have changed
but you haven't!
Greetings, D.I.G. Saheb
To you too
Felicitations on the marriage
of your daughter
Many thanks, Mr. Jamuna for
gracing this occasion
Now that your daughter is married
do give some attention to
my niece's marriage too
Your girl is matchless, shouldn't have
any problem with her marriage
Congratulations!
This means Raja Saheb has taken over the
responsibility of this marriage
Raja Saheb?!
After all, he is the Raja. He is, he is
Raja Saheb, many, many thanks,
very many thanks
Greetings, Raja Saheb
Gauri, come pay your respects
to the Raja Saheb
He has taken over the responsibility
for your marriage
Bow to him, bow to him
Raja Saheb, the girl has turned away,
it means things will work out!
Gauri?
Gauri
Gauri called me. I'm coming
Wait, Gauri, wait, I am coming.
Gauri
Raja Saheb
Gauri
What is going on?
Going on? It is you who were going,
I caught you
Get up
Take my hand. Oh, my back is giving away
Your pulse is throbbing like a water pump!
This is all due to Gauri
At the thought of her not just the pulse
but everything starts throbbing
Everything?
That lass has bewitched me
Wherever I look, it is her I see
Raja Saheb, just don't see her
at the window
or you are sure to lose your limbs
Don't force this marriage on me, Auntie
I will not marry someone
I have not seen or known
Friends, can I marry without
seeing the boy?
No, no, never
See!
Quiet, you devils. Go away, scram
We are like your parents
We only have your welfare at heart
And, after all, he is a very big man
But...
He is very rich
It will be a life of luxury
You will live like a queen,
you wretched girl!
Damn! Queen or empress
I will not agree until I have
seen the boy's face
God, what a fix! Raja Saheb's face
isn't worth looking at!
Gopal!
Bring over the horse if it is ready
What are you staring at?
Are you not dumb?
He who thinks me dumb is a bloody fool
But when did you start talking?
About 15 to 20 years ago
You mean all these years you
Learned your secrets by
pretending to be dumb
You thought a mute would not be able to
reveal your secrets!
I will tell Raja Saheb all the things
you have said about him
No brother, please, I beg you
please forgive me
Otherwise I will lose my life
along with my job
Whatever happens, tell him I must
No brother, please, no
Forgive me, this once
Hey you lily-livered pigeon, you crazy mare,
Shankar was only moving his lips,
it was me who was doing the talking
Is that so?
Stop sweating all over
Check this out
He was only moving his lips
We were just doing what we used to
practice in childhood
You mean you two conspired to
make a fool of me?
These days everyone is trying to make a
fool of the other
Like it just happened to you
What is it? Shall I punch you!
Raja Saheb, Raja Saheb!
What?
Good news, good news!
Auntie has agreed to the marriage
Really?
And so has Uncle
And Gauri?
She has not
She has not? Why? What am I lacking?
The mirror never lies. Look!
Oh, Raja Saheb, I have a
remedy for every ill
Why are you dejected?
Take a look at this
But eating this potion won't help me
Not eating, for applying on your head!
Black hair will definitely make a
difference to your appearance
Maybe I can dye my hair, but what can I
do about this wrinkled face?
How will I change this?
Got it! I will send a
photograph instead!
What is all this?
We have agreed to your marriage
Without asking me?
Daughter, great good fortune has
come our way
Oh, what a jewel of a man he is!
Auntie, I have told you this earlier,
and I repeat
I will not marry anyone without first
seeing the boy
Look at his photograph
If you don't like him
all these gifts will be returned
Show me
Here. Look, look at this photograph
He looks like a film hero.
How handsome he is, isn't he?
Yes, what a nice looking brother-in-law!
Hey! She didn't even see the photo
Gauri, where is the photograph?
Gauri, where is it?
Brother-in-law looks like a hero
He is good looking, eh!
Why are you staring at me?
You can talk?
Yes, I can also see you
You are only a photograph,
and photographs don't see or talk
If you wish, I can also touch you
Oh, really? Let's see you touch me then
I will dance at the Raja's Wedding!
Father!
Raja is getting married, but
you are rejoicing!
Hey, why are you ruining my mood?
I am telling the truth
Are you sure you are telling the truth?
OK, so tell me why I am dying my hair
To match it with your black heart!
Wrong
Its because I am thinking about marriage
So, you're thinking about marriage?
I am also going crazy thinking about it
Right, isn't it?
I will have to get married
Go ahead, its high time
Oh, consider it done already!
Done, but with whom?
With the one who comes to this
house every day
The one who comes to cook every day?
Yes, the same one
The one who does all our housework
Are you marrying me off to Rasili?
Yes. What?
Rasili is going to be my wife,
and your step mother
No, she is going to be my wife and
your daughter-in-law
No, she is mine
She is mine                                                 She is mine
She is mine
Rasili!
Both... Both have called together?
Yes
Oh, my God!
Rasili, Rasili, you tell us
whom do you love?
Is it the son or the son's father?
Don't be shy, Rasili
Its time to open up
Yes, Rasili, be as brazen as you want to
Tell us, whom do you love?
Please speak out                                                   Well?
I love both!
Please stand up for the ceremony
The bride goes first
Father, what is this?                                 What?
Raja Saheb is changing the
whole marriage system
Why?
Like a bridegroom he was going around
his courtyard on a horse
And now, he is also doing the
marriage ceremony himself!
He's turned everything topsy-turvy
Shut up! He is the Raja Saheb
Whatever he does is right
My foot!
Priest, continue with your chants,
this is the last round
I will take care of her
But...!
Keep reciting your chants
The rounds are completed
Now bless them
You! I...!
How did I come here?
I am your husband
I have completed the marriage ceremony
No, no, that was no marriage ceremony
I do not believe that ceremony
This marriage is not acceptable to me
You have cheated me, cheated me
Listen sweetheart, cheating or not,
I have won the game
Today I will fulfill my heart's desire
I have married you.  Marriage!
If you come near me, I will scream
All brides scream on wedding nights
Go ahead and scream
You can never have me
Help!
Will you kill me?
I will kill myself!
Gauri will never be yours, never
I will never accept you as my husband
I would rather be dead than accept you
Your life is my property now
No, never
I have control over your life and death
Everything is in my hands. Understand?
If I wish I can rape you right now
But I will not do that
Because I want to play the game of
husband and wife with you
Never!
That is why I have married you
But now I have decided that
When I take you, it will be
with your consent
I will wait for that day to dawn
I will wait
No! Never!
You smile and put salt on my wounds
I see, and am surprised
You've got yourself a flower
more beautiful than me
But its fragrance...
you could not smell it's fragrance!
Bindiya
I have heard that women understand
one another
Do something with this girl
So that she falls madly in love with me
Raja Saheb
Don't argue. I will give you a fortune
It's your job to bring that girl to
tomorrow's function, dressed as a bride
This bullet could have
gone through you, but...
My brother is besotted with you
Brother loves you, and I love Brother
Love has thwarted death
Bloody Fool, I have lost to your resolve
At the party, I put Bindiya
in your place
Just to save the honour of this house
And you tried to destroy my good name
by running away
I will now show you
my true colours
I have been very patient
You will now witness my hatred
When you are made to starve,
you will learn to obey Raja's wishes
Shankar, are you thinking what I am?
It looks like the girl is
being mistreated
I had heard that saying about
"Something being fishy"
But this looks like the
whole blasted fish market!
All are rogues, the buyers
and the sellers
That is why I feel like
digging up the facts
You talking about my father?
Chewing tobacco? Who... Me?
You are chewing tobacco?
Spitting it out?
If you chew then you are bound to spit
Are you throwing up? Vomit...
I get it!
You are talking about getting my father
to spit out the secret
Here, down another one
Down another, down another, you say,
and make me drink...
like they water a camel before
taking it into the desert
Am I a camel? Am I?
Look, my dear... you called me
and I have come
You asked me for a drink,
and I gave it to you
You told me to feed you, I fed you
But why have you not quenched
my thirst so far?
Come my lass, I'll quench your thirst
Hey, where did this fifth hand
come from?!
Silly, but there are only four hands,
not five
Count, count, count
Eh. There are only four hands...
Why did I see five?
You are drunk, that's why
Okay. I am drunk, that's why
What happened, my love?
Who just gave a fake pill to your love?
The fifth hand is there
Is definitely exists!
Five hands? Look, two mine
and two yours
See, that's the fifth hand,
the one on your shoulder
But this is your hand
My hand?
It's you who has held me all along
How can it be my hand?
Caught it! Caught the fifth hand!
This is not the fifth hand,
it is the hand of the Law
He who loses courage,
falls into the hands of the Law
But why is the law after me?
You could've done some hanky-panky
The whole village is talking about it
You gave Raja Saheb such a pill that...
all night he remained like a rusted gun
No trigger pulled, no shots fired,
no consummation of his marriage even
You have grossly cheated Raja Saheb
I have cheated him?
It is he who has cheated Gauri
What cheating are you talking about?
Hey speak up! Where's your voice?
How can I raise my voice,
even the winds can carry tales
If Raja Saheb gets the wind of the
tale I've been telling you
then he will...!
Go on! Whisper into my ear!
Even the wind will not hear anything
Go on, tell me, tell me
Shankar, that innocent girl
is suffering
Just wait and see, their big manion will
crumble into dust
Because God has said,
that the tears of innocents
give birth to flames
How disgusting, that my father is a
part of this dirty game
And that poor girl...!
Shankar, see what she is doing!
You!
You helped Raja Saheb to
bring me to this state
You have pushed me into the
flames of this hell!
For a handful of coin from your master,
you have ruined my entire life!
What a game of deception you have
played with the life of a girl!
Such a great fraud!
If you were not marrying me,
why did you send your photograph?
Why did you send this photograph?
When I saw this photograph
I started dreaming of a life with you
I accepted you as my honoured husband
Made you a part of my life
But you...
You have ruined my life
The photograph that was given to me
was a fraud
and my marriage ceremony too was a fraud
You are the root cause of all this
Tell me, why did you do it?
Why did you, why did you?
Why did you do this to me?
Why are you treating me so?
When I wish to die, you don't let me
What is my fault, tell me!
Can you tell me what is my fault?
Whom are you asking for an answer?
Whom are you asking?
He cannot answer any of your questions
Perhaps you do not know that
this poor man is dumb
Dumb, he is dumb
In any case, whether they have a
voice or not
the poor are always losers
in the world of the rich
Since childhood this poor guy has been
brought up on a diet of
Raja Saheb's ill treatment
But he is not involved in his cruelties
Shankar is completely innocent of
whatever has happened or is happening
I'm...
Raja Saheb, you have again had too much
Yes, yes, I have drunk
My friend has a party for my wedding
But me, I am alone!
No wife!
I will break her. I will crush her pride
My wife, she will... at my foot!
Bloody Fool, Bloody Fool
No, I will not be humiliated today
I will stay awake and keep you awake too
Look, I've just washed my face
with cold water
I am sitting with my eyes wide open
Take off your clothes, quickly
Raja Saheb, I am ready
Raja Saheb
Raja Saheb!
Shankar. It is the thirsty man
who goes to the spring
But today the spring is asking you to
quench its thirst!
Quench my thirst, Shankar
Quench my thirst
Shankar
I will, I will
You!
You, the thirsty spring
And I am the whirlpool of youth
Come, drown in my depths
Quench it, quench it
Quench your thirst
No, stop it!
Nobody can help you now
Stop!
Shankar!
Shankar, help!
No!
Shankar!
Help me!
Shankar!
Want to beat me?
Go on
Hit me, will you?
Hit me?
You laid hands on Birjwa
This is your place, under my shoe
Worthless slave
No, Birjwa, leave him
You interfered in my matters
No Birjwa, no!
How dare you!
Don't hit him
Birjwa
Bloody bastard!
Hey, Birjwa, what's happened?
Why are you beating Shankar?
Ask him
How he enjoys himself with Bindiya
when you fall asleep
I've caught them red-handed today
No, no, don't hit him
It was me who went to him
I am at fault, don't beat him
Wretch, you cheated me
You went to my servant?
I will teach you a lesson you will not
forget all your life
Chanda Bai, this fake jewel of my mansion
is fit to be sold every night
She doesn't belong to my mansion anymore
but to your Salon
Bloody Fool!
Forgive me, Shankar. I misunderstood you.
Daughter, a woman's husband is her god;
it is her prime duty to serve him
All her life is for her husband
Hold his image in your mind and say
Say it with me: "My husband is my god"
See his image in your heart
Only his image
Repeat after me: "My husband is my god"
"It is my duty to obey him."
Sai it, dear: "My husband is my god."
Say it, daughter. Say it.
Ashok brother is here,
brother Ashok is here!
Hey, you all are very naughty
What is in common?
Brother Ashok has come
Brother Ashok has come
Ashok!
Look, Ashok has come!
Here, take this
Have you come then?
But why didn't you write?
Bless you, son, bless you
We have been missing you so much
We are seeing you after so long!
What did you bring for uns from Dubai?
Where is Gauri?
Sister Gauri has gone
Daughters don't stay in their
parental homes forever
Why? Didn't you get the wedding card?
What? Wedding?
You people have married off my sister?
Without consulting me?
Where? To whom?
Son, she is living like a
queen in the mansion
I just cannot tell you how
Very fortunate she is, my son
and he is a real king, not in name only
Raja!
Here's a telegram from your brother
He is coming to meet you
If you become emotional and
talk about our family matter
then, in front of you
your brother will be
Where is Raja Saheb?
Here I am, brother-in-law
You?!
Yes, I am her life partner
Yes, brother
He is your brother-in-law
Brother!
Why are you crying?
Why didn't you come to my wedding?
Gauri!
I wish you were there to send me off
I only found out on coming here
that you had got married
Brother, if only you had come
just as suddenly at my wedding
then I would have had
no cause for regret
Gauri, aren't you happy?
But I am happy, brother
No brother. I am happy. Very happy.
I doubt any other woman has
so much happiness as I do
I had never dreamt that
I could be so happy
See all this, brother
This grand mansion
and my position here
Gauri, I had some doubts
before coming here
but seeing how happy you are
has relieved me
Now I can go back with a light heart
Raja Saheb,
I will remain forever grateful to you
You have crowned our poverty
with your wealth
I will take your leave now
Oh, wait a while
Have a rest, some refreshment
You have just arrived
Many thanks, but it is
against our culture to take
food or drink from a
younger sister's home
Yes, there you are right
Very well
How can I go against your customs?
You may go
Farewell
Please stop the carriage for a minute
What's the matter?
What are you saying?
I don't follow you
Your sister's marriage is a fraud
Take her away from here
No
Seeing you this way has made me mad!
The demon inside me is unleashed!
I will not spare you today
Gauri!
Your life has been destroyed
But you remained silent
Please go away from here, brother
You don't know how dangerous
these people are
You have heaped injustice on my
innocent sister
In the name of marriage you have
perpetrated a fraud on my sister
My sister will not spend
another minute in this hell
Come on, sister
Brother!
You think you can take my wife away?
This mansion is a cage
and death is hovering at all its doors
You have entered the jaws of death
Brother!
Brother!
Brother
Brother
Let my brother go
