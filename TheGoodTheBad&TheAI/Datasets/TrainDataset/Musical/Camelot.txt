Guenevere, Guenevere
In that dim, mournful year
Saw the men she heId so dear
Go to war for Guenevere
The rules of battIe are not for
Lancelot du Lac, Your Majesty.
Let us attack now while they sIeep.
We will attack when
I give the command, at dawn.
Merlyn...
...why is Jenny in that castle...
...behind walls I cannot enter?
How did I blunder into this...
...agonizing absurdity?
When did I stumble?
Where did I go wrong?
Should I not have loved her?
Then I should not have been...
...born.
Oh, Merlyn...
...how did it happen?
I haven't got much time.
A thin inch of sunlight...
...the arrows begin to fly.
Merlyn...
...if I am to die...
...in battle...
...please do not let me die...
...bewildered.
Think, Arthur.
Think back.
Think back.
Think back!
Oh, Merlyn!
Think back.
Think back!
Think...
...back.
Back! To one of the most
important days of your life.
Oh, yes!
Hello.
My name is Arthur.
I think I'll call you...
...Wart.
""I think I'll call you Wart.""
No, no, no!
Now you've gone too far back.
Not the day you met me!
The day you met Guenevere.
The day she came...
...to Camelot.
That's the beginning.
Yes.
I know...
...what my people...
...are thinking tonight.
I know what my people
are thinking tonight
As home through the shadows they wander
Everyone smiling in secret deIight
As they stare at the castle and ponder
Whenever the wind blows this way
You can almost hear everyone say...
...I wonder what the king
is doing tonight
What merriment is the king
pursuing tonight?
The candles at the court
They never burned as bright
I wonder what the King
is up to tonight.
How goes the final hour
As he sees the bridal bower
Being legally and regally prepared?
WeII, I'll tell you what the king
is doing tonight
He's scared
Oh, he's scared
You mean that a king who fought a dragon
Whacked him in two and fixed his wagon
Goes to wed in terror and distress?
Oh, yes!
A warrior who's so caIm in battle
Even his armor doesn't rattle
Faces a woman petrified with fright?
Right!
You mean the appalling clamoring
That sounds like a blacksmith hammering
Is merely the banging
of his royal knees?
Please!
You wonder what the King
is wishing tonight?
He's wishing he were
in Scotland fishing tonight
What occupies his time
While waiting for his bride?
He's searching high and low
For some place to hide
And, oh, the expectation,
The sublime anticipation
He must feel about
the wedding night to come
WeII, I'll tell you what the King
is feeling tonight
He's numb! He shakes!
He quails! He quakes!
And that's what the King is doing
Tonight!
How long before we get to Camelot?
Soon, Ma'am, but don't look out there,
it's a ghastIy forest.
It's the most ferocious, savage...
...terrifying forest I've ever seen.
I simply adore it.
Does Your Ladyship not realize
that this forest is crawling...
...with outIaws and brigands?
Clary! You think there's
a chance of meeting one?
Don't say it, Ma'am.
It would be marvelous.
Imagine, Ma'am, soon you will
not only meet the man you will marry...
...but His Majesty,
King Arthur of EngIand.
And one is the other.
What have you to say to that?
Was there ever a more
inconvenient marriage of convenience?
I am at the golden age of seductability,
and is my fate seaIed with a kiss?
Is it?
No, sealed with a seal!
Where are all the simple joys
of maidenhood?
Where are all those
adoring, daring boys?
Where's the knight pining so for me?
He leaps to death in woe for me
Oh where are a maiden's simple joys?
Shan't I have the normal life
a maiden should?
Shall I never be rescued in the wood?
Shall two knights never tilt for me
And let their blood be spilt for me?
Oh, where are the simple joys
Of maidenhood?
Shall I never be disputed for
Or on any minstrel's lips?
Never have my face recruited for
Launching countless ships?
Where are the simple joys
of maidenhood?
Are those sweet, gentle pleasures
gone for good?
Shall a feud not begin for me?
Shall kith not kill their kin for me?
Oh where are the trivial joys?
Harmless, convivial joys?
Where are the simple joys
Of maidenhood?
Halt!
Her Highness will rest here
while the Royal Hairdresser...
...attends her.
Can someone help with this canopy?
I should like some tea
while I'm being coifed.
St. Genevieve
It's Guenevere
Remember me?
St. Genevieve
I'm over here, beneath this tree!
You know how faithful and devout I am
You must admit I've always been a lamb
But Genevieve, St. Genevieve.
I won't obey you any more
You've gone a bit too far
I won't be bid and bargained for
Like beads at a bazaar
St. Genevieve, I've run away
Eluded them and fled
And from now on I intend
To pray to someone else instead
Oh, Genevieve, St. Genevieve
Where were you when my youth was sold?
Dear Genevieve
Sweet Genevieve
Shan't I be young before I'm old?
A thousand pardons, my Iady.
Don't run, I won't harm you.
You lie! You'll leap on me
and throw me down!
I'll do no such thing.
You'll carry me off on your shoulder!
No, I swear by the sword Excalibur
I won't touch you.
Why not?
How dare you insult me in this fashion?
Do my looks repel you?
-No, you're beautiful!
-Did you hear me praying?
I couIdn't help it.
You did pray loudIy.
So you know who I am?
Yes, you're Guenevere.
So that accounts for your polite,
respectful, despicable behavior?
Why isn't Merlyn here?
-Who?
-Merlyn. He's my teacher.
He's the wisest man alive. He'd
know what to do. He lives backwards.
-Beg your pardon?
-He lives backwards.
He doesn't age.
He...
...youthens?
He can remember the future...
...so he can tell you
what you'll do in it.
Come here.
CIose your eyes.
PIease.
Now just turn, gently.
Very slowly, open them.
Do you see that castle?
It used to light up
in a sort of pink gIow.
When I was young,
everything looked a little pink to me.
When Merlyn left,
he took all the pink with him.
Don't stare.
It's rude.
Who are you?
Actually, they call me Wart, actually.
-You sure you heard them properly?
-It's a nickname. Merlyn gave it to me.
Is it really Wart?
Why don't you run away with me?
You could be my protector,
defend me all over the world...
...in France, in England,
Mongolia, Scotland.
What a wonderful dream you spin.
And how easy it would be for me
to be caught up in it.
But...
...I must decline.
You forcing me to stay?
Oh, no, My Lady!
If you persist in escaping, I'll find
somebody brave to accompany you.
Then do so at once before
your wretched king finds me.
Do look around you, My Lady!
Reconsider.
Camelot is unique.
And we have, by far and away,
the most equabIe climate in all EngIand.
Ordained by decree.
Oh, come now!
It's true.
It's true!
The Crown has made it clear
The climate must be perfect
All the year
A law was made
a distant moon ago here
July and August cannot be too hot
And there's a legal limit
to the snow here
In Camelot
The winter is forbidden till December
And exits March the second on the dot
By order, summer lingers
through September
In Camelot
Camelot
I know it sounds a bit bizarre
But in Camelot
That's how conditions are
The rain may never fall
till after sundown
By eight the morning fog must disappear
In short, there's simply not
A more congenial spot
For happily-ever-aftering
Than here in Camelot
And I suppose the autumn leaves
fall into neat little piles?
No, My Lady.
They blow away completely.
At night, of course.
I know it gives a person pause
But in Camelot
Those are the legal laws
The snow may never
sIush upon the hillside
By nine p.m.
the moonlight must appear
In short, there's simply not
A more congenial spot
For happily-ever-aftering
Than here...
...in Camelot
Look!
There, on the hill!
I'm truly sorry, but...
...I'm afraid, on account of me...
...you may be hanged!
Or burnt at the stake for abducting me!
That uncivilized king of yours wiII....
Defend yourseIf!
There she is!
But who's that peasant with her?
The king!
Wart, it's the king!
Your Majesty, forgive me.
I did not know it was you.
The king.
When I was a young Iad
of 18 years of age...
...our good king, Pendragon, died,
leaving no one to succeed him...
...but a sword stuck through an anvil
that stood on a stone.
Written on it,
in gold letters, it said...
...""Who so pulleth this sword
from this stone...
...is rightwise born
King of all England.""
Many chaps tried to
dislodge it, but they failed.
So finally, a great tournament was
proclaimed for New Year's Day.
AII the mightiest knights in EngIand
were assembled at one time to have...
...a go at the sword.
I went to London as squire
to my cousin, Sir Kay.
On tournament day, Sir Kay found
he had left his sword at home...
...and he gave me
a shilling to fetch it.
Going through London,
I passed a square and saw a sword...
...rising out of a stone.
Not thinking very clearly...
...I thought it was a war memorial.
So I decided to borrow it...
...and to save myself the trip.
So I...
...took the sword and...
...and I failed.
So I tried again.
And I failed again.
So, with all my might,
I closed my eyes...
...and I tried...
...one last time.
And, lo!
The sword moved in my hand.
And slowly...
...it slid out of the stone.
I heard...
...a great roar.
I opened my eyes.
The square was full of people saying:
""...Long live the king!
Long live...
...the king.""
That's how I became king.
I never knew I would be.
I never wanted to be.
And since I am,
I've been ill at ease in my crown.
Until I dropped from the tree...
...and my eyes...
...beheld you.
And then, for the first time...
...I felt like a king.
I was glad to be king.
And most astonishing of all,
I wanted to be the most heroic...
...the wisest, the most...
...splendid king ever to sit...
...on any throne.
If My Lady will follow me...
...I'll find a proper companion...
...to accompany you.
I hear it never rains
Till after sundown
By eight the morning fog
must disappear
In short, there's simply not
A more congenial spot
For happily-ever-aftering
...than here...
...In Camelot
The map of England.
Map, indeed.
A fishnet of ill-begotten kingdoms
ruled by immoral lords...
...battling with their own unlawful
armies over illegal border lines.
And who is...
...king of this...
...jungle?
The man who 4 years ago
pledged he would become...
...the greatest king
who ever sat on any throne.
I...
...Arthur of England.
Yes.
The greatest warrior in the land.
For what purpose?
Might...
...doesn't always mean right.
What are you saying? To be right
and lose couldn't possibly be right.
Merlyn...
...used to frown on battles.
Yet he always...
...helped me win them.
Why?
Proposition:
Is it far better to be alive than dead?
Yes, far better.
If that is so...
...then why do we have wars...
...in which people can get killed?
I don't know, do you?
Yes.
Because somebody attacks.
Why do they attack?
Did I ever tell you...
...how Merlyn taught me how to think?
No.
By changing me into animals.
Oh, really! Arthur!
Jenny, I mean by making me believe...
...he had changed me into animals.
For instance, when a hawk
is up there Iooking down at the world...
...there are no boundaries.
Right?
Yet boundaries are what
somebody aIways attacks about.
And you win by pushing them
back across something that...
...that doesn't exist.
So we have battles for no reason at all.
Why, Jenny, why?
Because ladies love knights.
To see your knight in armor....
That's it, Jenny.
Jenny, that is it!
It's the armor!
It's the armor, Jenny.
The armor.
OnIy the knights are rich enough
to have armor. The foot soIdiers....
WeII, they have nothing.
So, aII that can happen
to a knight is...
...an occasionaI...
...dent.
Proposition:
Right or wrong...
...if they have the might.
So right or wrong, they're aIways right.
That's wrong.
Right?
I'm here.
Suppose we create
a new order of chivaIry?
A new order where
might is onIy used for right.
To improve instead of to destroy.
We'II invite aII knights...
...and kings of aII kingdoms to Iay down
their arms to come and join us.
Oh, yes, Jenny.
And we'II...
...take one of the Iarge rooms
in the castIe...
...put a tabIe in it
and aII the knights wiII gather at it.
And do what?
TaIk across it.
Debate.
Make Iaws.
PIan improvements.
But, Arthur, do you think
aII the knights wiII ever want to...
...to do such a ridicuIousIy
peacefuI thing?
We'II make it a great honor.
Very fashionabIe.
Everyone wiII want to join.
OnIy now...
...the knights wiII whack onIy for good.
Might for right.
Might for right.
Might...
...for right!
That's it, Jenny!
Might....
No, not might is right!
Might...
...for...
...right!
It's very originaI.
And civiIized, Jenny.
It wiII have to be
an awfuIIy Iarge tabIe.
What of jeaIousy? AII wiII cIaim
superiority and want to sit at the head.
We'II make it...
...a round tabIe.
So there is no head.
A round tabIe!
My father's got one
that wouId be perfect. It seats 150.
He had it as a wedding present
and he never used it.
We'II send the heraIds
Riding through the country
TeII every Iiving person far and near
That there is simpIy not
In aII the worId a spot
Where ruIes a more respIendent king
Than here
In CameIot
CameIot
In far off France
I hear you caII
To you aIone I'II give my aII
I know in my souI
what you expect of me
And aII that and more
I shaII be
A knight of the tabIe round
ShouId be invincibIe
Succeed where a Iess fantastic man
WouId faiI
CIimb a waII no one eIse can cIimb
CIeave a dragon in record time
Swim a moat
In a coat of heavy iron maiI
No matter the pain
He ought to be unwinceabIe
ImpossibIe deeds
ShouId be his daiIy fare
But where in the worId
Is there in the worId
A man so extraordinaire?
C'est moi, c'est moi
I'm forced to admit
'Tis I
I humbIy repIy
That mortaI who these marveIs can do
C'est moi, c'est moi
'Tis I
I've never Iost
In battIe or game
I'm simpIy the best by far
When swords are crossed
'Tis aIways the same
One bIow and au revoir
C'est moi, c'est moi
So admirabIy fit
A French Prometheus Unbound
And here am I
With vaIor untoId
ExceptionaIIy brave
AmazingIy boId
To serve at the tabIe round
The souI of a knight
ShouId be a thing remarkabIe
His heart and his mind
As pure as morning dew
With a wiII and a seIf-restraint
That's the envy of every saint
He couId easiIy work a miracIe or two
To Iove and desire
He ought to be unsparkabIe
The ways of the fIesh
ShouId offer no aIIure
But where in the worId
Is there in the worId
A man so untouched
And pure?
C'est moi
I bIush to discIose
I'm far too nobIe to Iie
That man in whom
These quaIities bIoom
C'est moi, C'est moi
'Tis I
I've never strayed
From aII I beIieve
I'm bIessed with an iron wiII
Had I been made
The partner of Eve
We'd be in Eden stiII
C'est moi, c'est moi
The angeIs have chosen
To fight their battIes beIow
And here am I
As pure as a prayer
IncredibIy cIean
With virtue to spare
The godIiest man I know
C'est moi!
Oh, King Arthur!
What caIiber of man you must be...
...to have envisioned
a new order of Iife.
I worship you before knowing you.
Don't run away, coward!
Come back and fight!
The swine!
-Are you hurt, Your Majesty?
-Fine.
PIease!
The next time you traffic with me...
...remember, you chaIIenge
the right arm of King Arthur.
ReaIIy?
I am King Arthur.
What?
You...
...are the king!
Yes, aImost the Iate king.
And I struck you?
Your Majesty!
I'm LanceIot du Lac.
In France I heard of your new order
and came to join.
I beg Your Majesty to forgive me.
Not because I deserve it...
...but because by forgiving me...
...I'II suffer more.
But, reaIIy, dear chap...
...I don't want you to suffer at aII.
I want to congratuIate you.
PIease rise. You, too, squire.
I can't, mon roi.
-I'm too ashamed to Iift my head.
-WeII, then I command you.
I have never feIt
a bash in my chest quite Iike it.
It was most spectacuIar.
Where did you Iearn to do it?
My skiII comes from training, mon Roi.
My strength from purity.
WeII, that's a unique recipe.
He's a unique man, Your Majesty.
At the age of fourteen
he couId defeat any jouster in France.
His father, King Ban,
made me his squire.
King Ban?
In France?
What did you say your name was?
LanceIot du Lac, Your Majesty.
You're LanceIot?
I was toId you were coming.
You were toId?
By MerIyn, the court magician.
He said to me one day...
...""Keep your eye out for a Frenchman
caIIed LanceIot du Lac.
He wiII come to the court of CameIot
and he wiII be....""
What was it now?
""He wiII be....""
Your aIIy, if you'II take me.
Your friend, who asks no friendship.
Your defender when you need one...
...whose body is your sword to brandish.
Did he prophesy that, Your Majesty?
For aII that, I am.
ReaIIy, my dear feIIow...
...this is far more
than I couId wish for...
...or even ask.
Then you wiII accept me?
Without hesitation.
-We wiII arrange for your knighthood.
-Oh, thank you!
We must arrange for
your knighthood immediateIy.
No, Your Majesty.
AII you know of me is words.
Invest me because of deeds, sire.
Give me an order.
-Now?
-This moment.
Send me on a mission.
Is there some wrong I can right?
Some enemy I can battIe?
Some periI I can undertake?
WeII, actuaIIy,
there's not much going on today.
It's the first of May. The Queen and
some of the court have gone a-Maying.
Gone a-Maying?
Yes, it's a sort of...
...picnic?
They eat berries
and chase young girIs around--
It's a custom we have here.
This is EngIand, you know.
And this is the season
for gathering fIowers.
Knights gathering fIowers?
WeII, someone has to do it!
And besides, it's....
It's civiIized.
And civiIization shouId have...
...a few gentIe hobbies.
Come.
I want you to meet the queen.
Dap, take the horses and feed them.
By George!
I suddenIy remembered
what MerIyn said of you.
How strange!
He said that you wouId be the
greatest knight ever to sit at my tabIe.
That was Iong before
I thought of a tabIe.
So he knew it wouId exist.
Oh, dear!
I thought he meant a dining tabIe.
But he meant this.
The Round TabIe!
And I have stumbIed on my future.
I've done...
...the right thing.
Did you ever doubt it, Your Majesty?
Of course.
OnIy fooIs...
...never doubt.
WeIcome, LanceIot.
BIess you for coming.
WeIcome to my tabIe.
It's May
It's May
The Iusty month of May
That IoveIy month
When everyone goes
BIissfuIIy astray
It's here, it's here
That shocking time of year
When tons of wicked IittIe thoughts
MerriIy appear
It's May!
That gorgeous hoIiday
When every maiden itches for fun
WhoIesome or ""un""
It's mad!
Depraved in every way
Those dreary vows that everyone takes
Everyone breaks
Everyone makes divine mistakes
The Iusty month of May
The Iusty month of May
That darIing month when everyone throws
SeIf-controI away
It's time to do
A wretched thing or two
And try to make each precious day
One you'II aIways rue
The month of ""Yes, you may.""
A time for every
FrivoIous whim
Proper or ""im.""
It's wiId!
It's wiId! It's gay!
A IibeIous dispIay
The birds and bees
WiII aII of their vast
Amorous past
Gaze at the human race
Aghast!
The Iusty
Month of May!
Now then...
...which way to go?
North.
No, no, that's north.
No, that's north.
I'm compIeteIy Iost.
Who's that rusty oId feIIow?
I've never seen him before,
Your Majesty.
Offer him assistance.
That mountain seems famiIiar.
Let's see.
Good day, my Iord.
How do you do, young man.
The name of King PeIIinore here.
You are a king, sire?
Of what country?
I don't know.
I Iost my kingdom.
To whom?
WeII, I misIaid it.
I Ieft it somewhere and I....
I can't find my way back.
-Why, I beIieve him.
-Your Majesty!
Your Majesty?
Yes, my Iord. You are addressing
Her Majesty, the Queen of EngIand.
The queen?
Why, why! How do you do?
Forgive me, Ma'am.
The beastIy hinges need oiIing.
Be at ease, my Iord.
WeIcome to CameIot.
Haven't I been here before?
Yes, years ago. I spent a joIIy
fortnight with a fine IittIe feIIow...
...caIIed Wart.
Ever met him, Ma'am?
ConstantIy.
He's my husband.
King Arthur of EngIand.
The King? Is he?
WeII, weII! Is he?
By Jove, good for him!
That's what I caII weII done.
Imagine. The king!
And he knows the name
of what he's king of.
Arthur wouId be pIeased to see you.
WouId you care to spend the night?
What, in a bed?
In a reaI bed?
Damnation, I'd Iike that.
I haven't put spine to feathers
since I Ieft....
Since I Ieft....
Go, one of you.
Escort His Majesty to the castIe.
I'm very gratefuI to you, Ma'am.
Thank you, very much.
I want to present to you
LanceIot du Lac.
He's come aII the way from France
to join our TabIe.
This is the LanceIot
that MerIyn used to speak of.
You're most weIcome.
I'm honored to be among you, miIady.
And aIIow me to pIedge my eternaI
dedication to this nobIe cause.
Thank you, monsieur.
Arthur, I met this strange man--
This spIendid dream
must become a universaI reaIity.
What?
AbsoIuteIy. It reaIIy must.
I have assured the king
he may caII upon me...
...at any time to perform any deed,
no matter the danger.
Thank you, monsieur.
That's most comforting.
I'm aIways on duty.
Yes, I can see that.
I wouId Iove to come to Iunch...
...but I want to Iisten to the pIans
that we have been discussing.
ExpIain it.
-To the queen, sire?
-Yes, of course.
WouId not Madame find it tedious?
I have never found chivaIry tedious.
So far.
May I remind you...
...that the Round TabIe happens to be
the idea of my husband.
My husband's idea.
Any idea, miIady...
...however exaIted, couId be improved.
-ReaIIy?
-Of course.
I've suggested that we create
a training program for knights.
-Isn't that a marveIous idea, Jenny?
-A training program?
The Round TabIe must have a standard.
A standard physicaI
and a standard moraI.
And whose abiIities wouId serve
as a standard, monsieur?
Oh, certainIy not mine, miIady.
It wouId not be fair.
Not fair? In what way?
I wouId never ask anyone to Iive
by my standards, miIady.
To devote your Iife...
...to the tortured quest
for perfection in body and spirit.
I wouId not ask that of anyone.
No, nor wouId I.
And have you achieved perfection,
monsieur?
PhysicaIIy, yes, miIady.
But the refining of the souI
is an endIess struggIe.
I dare say. I do daresay.
Do you mean you've never been
defeated in battIe or in a tournament?
No, Your Majesty.
And I gather...
...you consider it unIikeIy
ever to happen in the future?
HighIy, Your Majesty!
How was the channeI, LanceIot?
Was it a good crossing?
TeII me a IittIe of your struggIe
for the perfection of the spirit.
Have you jousted with humiIity IateIy?
""HumiIity,"" miIady?
HumiIité.
Or isn't it fashionabIe
in France this year?
We had best discuss the program
eIsewhere. You Iook too beautifuI...
...to have anything on your mind
other than froIic and fIowers.
Have a IoveIy day.
Same to aII of you.
Come aIong, LanceIot.
Come quickIy.
Good day, my queen.
-Mon dieu, he's unpIeasant.
-And so poisonousIy good.
He probabIy waIked across the channeI.
Sir Dinadan?
When is the next tournament?
A week from Saturday, Your Majesty.
And who are the 3 best jousters we have?
Sir LioneI, Sir Sagramore...
...and with aII humiIitay...
...I, Your Majesty.
ReaIIy?
Sir LioneI?
Do you recaII the other night
That I distinctIy said you might
Serve as my escort
At the next town fair?
WeII, I'm afraid there's someone
Who I must invite in pIace of you
Someone who pIainIy is
Beyond compare
The Frenchman's power is more tremendous
Than I have ever seen anywhere
And when a man is that stupendous
He, by right, shouId take me
To the fair
Your Majesty, Iet me tiIt with him
And smite him
Don't refuse me so abruptIy
I impIore
Oh, give me the opportunity
To fight him
And GauI wiII be divided
Once more
You wiII bash and thrash him?
I wiII smash and mash him!
You'II give him troubIe?
He wiII be rubbIe.
A mighty whack?
His skuII wiII crack!
Then you may
Take me to the fair
If you do aII the things
You promise
In fact, my heart wiII break
ShouId you not take me
To the fair
Sir Sagramore?
I have some rather painfuI news
ReIative to the subject who's
To be beside me at the next court baII
You were the chosen one, I know
But it's tradition it shouId go
To the unquestioned champion
In the haII
And I'm convinced
That spIendid Frenchman
Can easiIy conquer one and aII
And besting aII our IocaI
Henchmen, he
ShouId sit beside me
At the baII
I beg of you, Ma'am
WithhoId your invitation
I swear to you this chaIIenge
WiII be met
And when I have finished up
The operation
I shaII serve him to Your Highness
En brochette
You'II pierce right through him?
I'II barbecue him!
A wicked thrust?
It wiII be dust to dust.
From fore to aft?
He'II feeI...
...a draft.
My goodness!
You may sit
By me at the baII
If you demoIish him
In battIe
In fact, I know I'd cry
Were you not by me
At the baII
Sir Dinadan?
Didn't I promise that you may
Guide me to London on the day
That I go up to judge
The cattIe show
As it is quite a nasty ride
There must be someone by my side
Who'II be defending me
From beast and foe
So when I choose whom I prefer go
I take the strongest knight I know
And young du Lac seems strongest
Ergo
He shouId
Take me to the cattIe show
Your Majesty can't beIieve
This bIustering prattIe
Let him prove it
With a sword or Iance instead
I promise you when I'm done
This gory battIe
His shouIders wiII be Ionesome
For his head
You'II disconnect him?
I'II vivisect him!
You'II open wide him?
I'II subdivide him!
Then you may guide me
To the show
If you can carry out
Your program
In fact, I'd grieve inside
ShouId you not guide me
To the show
MiIady,
We shaII put an end to
That GaIIic bag of noise
And nerve
When we do aII that we
Intend to
He'II be a pIate of French
Hors d'oeuvres
I do appIaud your nobIe goaIs
Now Iet us see if you
Achieve them
And if you do
Then you wiII be the three
Who wiII go to the baII
To the show
And take me
To the fair
My Iords!
Have you seen the Iatest edict?
Tis the finaI straw.
Knights who refuse to Iay down
their arms wiII be attacked...
...as if they were serfs.
We're not onIy to kiII foot soIdiers,
but knights as weII.
We know aII about it, Dinadan.
But these other knights...
...if they fight back...
...we couId be kiIIed.
What's the sense of being born
in the upper cIass...
...if you can get kiIIed
Iike the Iower cIass?
It has the stink of French cooking.
After Saturday...
...we shaII be back
on Yorkshire pudding.
PeIIy, why don't you...
...give up searching for your kingdom...
...and come settIe down
with us for good?
That's joIIy kind of you, Arthur.
I mean, I Iove the bed and aII that...
...but the truth is I don't find things
too restfuI around here.
I can't heIp wishing
that you'd stop...
...thinking...
...and Ieave weII enough aIone.
I'm aII against
these new ideas of yours.
Any new ideas.
Best peopIe whacking best peopIe.
That's not right. That's not.
The chaps downstairs,
they're gnashing mad.
Gnashing.
It's aII his fauIt, you know.
Emperor CharIemagne there.
He has no activities,
that's his troubIe.
No secuIar pIeasures.
Quiet, PeIIy!
But do you not have any activities?
Any hobbies? Any...
...chambre à coucher?
No, PeIIinore.
There, you see.
Do you see?
Now why can't he be Iike the other chaps
instead of Iike himseIf?
Why can't he come home of an evening,
hang up his shieId...
...and do something
that he can be ashamed of?
You sure he's French?
I'm afraid my Iord is right.
AII fanatics are irritating, PeIIinore.
And I am a fanatic.
And I don't enjoy it
any more than you do.
Didn't you have a change to suggest?
We can discuss my idea tomorrow.
If you wiII excuse me.
WhiIe I was napping, did I miss
any improvements in chivaIry?
No, miIady.
If you wiII excuse me--
Monsieur, when you're arranging things
with God tonight...
...do be sure to give us
fine weather tomorrow.
Good night, sire.
Good night, PeIIinore.
Good night.
Heard the Iatest? He beIieves
his purity gives him miracuIous powers.
He was undoubtedIy referring
to his physicaI prowess.
Which is vast, indeed.
We'II see about that tomorrow.
Sagramore, LioneI and Dinadan
have aII chaIIenged him to a joust.
Three damn strong men!
-AII three in one day?!
-Quite, exactIy.
Isn't it marveIous? MarveIous!
ExactIy, yes!
I teII you, Arthur.
I've never met anyone Iike him.
I mean...
...he has no Iady.
TaIks to no one but you and God...
...crammed fuII of reIigion,
an aII-around unpIeasant feIIow.
I can't wait untiI tomorrow.
It'II be a joIIy massacre.
Good night, Ma'am.
I'm reaIIy Iooking forward to it.
It's going to be marveIous.
A note of thanks from Sir LioneI.
I've promised he can carry
my kerchief in the joust tomorrow.
I wouId be most gratefuI if you...
...wouId withdraw your permission
from Sir LioneI.
I don't think I couId.
It wouId be rather awkward.
Then aIIow LanceIot
to carry it against Sagramore.
-I've promised my kerchief to him.
-Then against Dinadan?
I've promised him too.
He asked so prettiIy, I couIdn't refuse.
This is appaIIing!
It wiII seem to the court
that you are championing his defeat.
Perhaps he won't be. He knocked
you unconscious. You became friends.
He may knock them out,
and they'II aII take a house together.
I reaIize he's having
a difficuIt time adjusting.
But he's a stranger.
He's not even EngIish.
He's French.
WeII, he suffers in transIation.
I ask you--
I beIieve you're jeaIous of the knights
and their attentions to me.
JeaIous?
What absoIute rubbish!
You know I am deIighted
the court adores you so.
I trust you as God above.
You have dragged me off the subject
and I want you back on it.
WiII you withdraw those kerchiefs?
OnIy if you command me as king.
If I do...
...wiII you forgive me?
Never.
Then, if I ask you as a husband,
wiII you as a favor?
I find him overbearing and pretentious.
The knights are against him.
Can we not stay on the subject?
There's nothing more to be said.
If the king wishes me to withdraw
what I have given...
...Iet him command me
and Yours HumbIy wiII graciousIy obey.
BIast you, MerIyn!
This is aII your fauIt!
You swore that you had taught me
Everything from A to Z
With nary an omission in between
WeII, I shaII teII you what
You obviousIy forgot
That's how a ruIer ruIes a queen
And what of teaching me
By turning me to animaI and bird
From beaver
To the smaIIest boboIink?
I shouId have had a whirI
At changing to a girI
To Iearn the way the creatures think
But wasn't there a night
On a summer Iong gone by
We passed a coupIe
WrangIing away
And did I not say
MerIyn
What if that chap were I
And did he not give counseI
And say
What was it now?
Oh, my mind's a waII
Oh, yes! By Jove!
Now I recaII
How to handIe a woman
There's a way
Said the wise oId man
A way known by every woman
Since the whoIe rigmaroIe began
Do I fIatter her
I begged him answer
Do I threaten or cajoIe or pIead
Do I brood or pIay the gay romancer
Said he, smiIing
No, indeed!
How to handIe a woman
Mark me weII
I wiII teII you, sir
The way to handIe a woman
Is to Iove her
SimpIy
Love her
MereIy Iove her
Love her
What's wrong, Jenny?
Where are you these days?
What are you thinking?
I don't understand you.
But no matter.
MerIyn toId me once...
...""Never be disturbed if you don't
understand what a woman is thinking.""
""They don't do it very often.""
But what do you do
whiIe they're doing it?
How to handIe a woman
Mark me weII
And I'II teII you, sir
The way to handIe a woman
Is to Iove her
SimpIy
Love her
MereIy Iove her
Love her
Just...
...Iove her.
Here comes Sir LioneI.
One.
Watch the way Sir Sagramore maneuvers
his horse. It's extraordinary.
You see how he drives to the right?
And then suddenIy....
How cIever!
He maneuvered his horse
right out from under himseIf.
What controI!
Two, Jenny.
He's dead, Jenny.
PIease!
Live!
Live!
I beg you.
He Iives!
I'm trembIing with fear.
And the strength...
...has Ieft my arms.
And terribIe feeIings...
...burn within me.
TeII me.
You're oIder than I.
You know this earth...
...better than I.
I onIy feII upon it...
...a few hours ago.
What are you taIking about?
Guenevere.
Wait, PeIIy.
You've never been in Iove...
...have you, PeIIy?
Once.
But not IateIy.
Now I'm not young enough.
Or not oId enough.
And I'm too young and too oId.
Too oId not to know that fears...
...can be imaginary.
And too young not to be...
...tormented by them.
Forgive me, miIady,
for disturbing you.
CIarinda toId me
Arthur was expected here.
Yes, he is.
I Iove you.
God forgive me...
...but I do!
Then God forgive us both, Lance.
What a gIorious day!
This is your day, Lance.
And at Iast you shaII receive...
...your earned and proper knighthood.
UnfortunateIy,
sainthood is not in my power.
Before the ceremony, we three
wiII have a nice quiet drink together.
It was on such a day as this...
...that the idea of the Round TabIe
was given birth.
Remember, Jenny?
To the Round TabIe!
To be invested...
...Knight of the Round TabIe
of EngIand...
...of the CastIe of Joyous Gard...
...LanceIot du Lac.
ExcaIibur.
Arise...
...Sir LanceIot.
Proposition:
If I couId choose...
...from every woman
who breathes on this earth...
...the face I wouId most Iove...
...the smiIe, the touch, the heart...
...the voice, the Iaugh,
the souI itseIf...
...every detaiI and feature
to the Iast strand of the hair...
...they wouId aII be Jenny's.
Proposition:
If I couId choose from every man
who breathes on this earth...
...a man for my brother...
...a man for my son...
...and a man for my friend...
...they wouId aII be Lance.
I Iove them.
I Iove them
and they answer me with pain...
...and torment.
Be it sin or not sin...
...they have betrayed me
in their hearts...
...and that's far sin enough.
I can see it in their eyes.
I can feeI it when they speak.
And they must pay for it
and be punished.
I shaII not be wounded
and not return it in kind.
I'm through with feebIe hoping.
I demand...
...a man's vengeance!
Proposition:
I'm a king...
...not a man.
And a very civiIized king.
CouId it...
...possibIy be civiIized...
...to destroy the thing I Iove?
CouId it possibIy be civiIized
to Iove myseIf above aII?
What about their pain...
...and their torment?
Did they ask for this caIamity?
Can passion...
...be seIected?
Is there any doubt...
...of their devotion to me,
and to our TabIe?
By God...
...I shaII be a king!
This is the time of King Arthur...
...when we shaII...
...reach for the stars!
This is the time of King Arthur...
...when vioIence is not strength,
and compassion is not weakness.
We are civiIized!
ResoIved:
We shaII Iive through this together!
ExcaIibur!
They...
...you...
...and I.
And may...
...God have mercy on us aII.
