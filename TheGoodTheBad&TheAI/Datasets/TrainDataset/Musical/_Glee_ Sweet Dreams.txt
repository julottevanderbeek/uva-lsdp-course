So here's what you missed
I'm ready to take my punishment. But
secretly she's just protecting Becky.
Emma, stop. Stop.
Broadwayworld.com is saying
is finally
happening this season.
Funny Girl,
Funny Girl.
Glee.
FINN: The truth is, I decided to
go to the Army after high school
Con los terroristas
Then do the Harlem Shake
Con los terroristas.
Con los terroristas
Then do the Harlem Shake
Ey
Con los terroristas.
Hey.
Get up.
Puck!
What are you doing here?
I live here now.
What?
Which dorm?
This one.
Like, right here. Top bunk.
Wh-What happened to Lee Hei?
Hei's no longer. He moved out
a couple hours ago.
I told him if he hoped to get
any studying done this year,
he should probably find another room.
I-I can't believe
you're going here. What
are you taking? Taking?
You mean, like, classes?
Dude, I'm just here
for my bro, some brews
and the bountiful Bettys.
I love college!
Yeah, college!
RACHEL:
Funny Girl
Hello, Dolly!;
The Main Event;
Hello, gorgeous.
ROZ: Excuse my jet lag,
I'm fresh off a plane
from North Korea
where I've been training
their swim team with
my assistant Dennis Rodman.
Do you like the new addition
to my wardrobe?
That's right. I've taken over
the Cheerios!
From that Phantom Menace
Sue Sylvester.
Someone with talent had to.
Did I also mention
that I'm in talks
with Miss Oprah Winfrey
to launch my very own
Cheerio! Network?
Like George Jefferson,
I'm movin' on up.
How is your delicate group
of weirdos? Are they still
rattled by that fake
school shooting?
That was a terrifying experience
for those kids.
And the adults.
I'm still having nightmares.
Honey, please.
I'm a child of the ghetto.
I can't sleep at night unless
I hear at least two gunshots.
Hey.
You get a chance
to talk to Finn yet?
No. I'm not ready.
Will, come on.
You need to patch the hole
in this fence
so the squirrels don't escape.
People grow apart, Shannon.
That's life.
Th-There's nothing wrong
with that.
That's what I thought about me
and my sister, Denise.
We used to scrap like grizzlies
in the Arctic,
and then when all that stuff
went down with Cooter,
she helped me out,
and we finally got to talkin'.
I'm more stubborn
than anybody here...
but I swallowed hard
and made amends with her.
It was one of the best things
I've ever done in my life.
Make the effort, Will.
It's worth it.
MARLEY:
BRITTANY: They really want me
to study string theory,
but I'm not all that interested
in arts and crafts.
Isn't M.I.T in Europe?
That would suck.
Hey, Tina. Are you
trying out a new look?
It's called steampunk.
It's the next big thing.
Oh. God, I love it.
: Oh, hey there.
You must, uh, be Marley.
Hi, Sam. That's not Sam.
That's Sam's
smarter twin brother, Evan.
Evan Evans.
What a pleasure to meet you.
Oh. Phone's ringing.
Oh, it's my brother.
Oh, hey, Sam, I was actually
just looking for you...
So have you guys heard
who's taking over the Cheerios!?
Yeah, it's insane.
And it made me realize
I have no idea whether I'm
on the Cheerios! Or not.
Like, literally can't remember.
Hey, guys.
Have you seen Evan?
You just missed him.
He went that way.
Unique, what are you doing?
Are those birth control pills?
Shh!
Don't blow a girl's cover. Kitty hooked
me up with a prescription for Loestrin,
and I heard that two dolls
a day will turn my Bs
into Ds in no time.
Guys, have you...
seen my twin?
Oh! Getting a call.
Hold on.
Oh, hey. Man, I was
just looking for you!
Unique, you cannot
take birth control.
Why not? Trans kids
everywhere are doing it.
All right, bro. Well,
I'll tell 'em you said hi.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Have fun at the zoo.
WILL: Big news, guys.
I just got a direct tweet
from the Greater Midwest
Regional.
High School Show Choir
Board of Directors.
The theme
for this year's regionals
is...
Sweaters.
...dreams.
Close.
As you know,
some of the past judges
we've had haven't been
that bright,
or that sober,
so our best bet is to take
the dream theme literally.
We'll start out
with "Dream Weaver"
and then we'll segue
into "Sweet Dreams"
and we'll bring it home
with "You Make
My Dreams Come True."
Okay.
Marley, you're frowning.
No. I just don't know
any of those songs.
Well, you'll know them
soon enough
because we're learning them
today.
Maybe...
could we try
some original songs,
like you did two years ago?
Yeah, my twin brother Sam
told me you guys
totally crushed
regionals two years ago
with those sweet tunes.
Well, S... um, Evan,
that was a different time
and a different team.
Mr. Shue, could we at least talk
about the set list?
I mean, when Finn was here,
we got to help...
Do I have to remind you guys
how lucky we are
to even be at regionals?
We're there on a technicality,
which means there's absolutely
no room for even
the smallest of mistakes.
Trust me.
Anybody else have something
they want to say?
Great. Brad, warm 'em up.
As honorary Rachel,
I would like to convene
this secret meeting
of the glee club.
Oh. Sam's sorry
he couldn't make it.
He said
to tell every... Oh.
Just got a text.
He's here.
Oh, hey, Sam.
Hey, Evan.
How long are we gonna
let him do this?
Just let it go.
It's like waking a sleepwalker.
It might kill him.
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm
late. What'd I miss?
What you missed
was Mr. Shue's set list.
It's gonna lose us regionals.
Oh, yeah, Evan was saying
something about that.
"Dream Weaver." Great song,
but it's from 1975.
"Sweet Dreams
." Amazing.
Released in 1982.
"You Make My Dreams Come True."
Originally performed in 1981,
and then performed again
by the glee club in a mash-up
that we did last year,
which Mr. Shue
didn't even remember.
He's completely lost touch.
We're screwed.
Can I get a witness?
We need to do current songs,
and if we do,
I know we can win.
Uh, guys...
can I say something?
I wrote some songs.
What if we performed those?
Please. No one wants to hear a
song about a fat mom. Okay.
What about...
Or a song about barfing.
But what about a song... Or a
song about loving an octoroon.
BLAINE: All right, all
right, all right, let's...
let's get serious.
We need to start brainstorming.
We'll pick a new set list
and then we'll break the news
to Mr. Shue.
:
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Excuse me, ladies.
Where are your tickets?
Wait, we need tickets?
Rules are rules.
Wait, wait, wait.
You both seem
like really nice girls,
and I don't want you
to miss out on all the fun...
...so I'm willing to make
an exception just this once.
Oh, my God,
you're such a sweetheart.
I am. Mm. Thing is,
if I let you go for free
and anybody hears about that,
the whole system
could collapse.
So I'm gonna need you
to pay me with your bikini tops.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Ah! Mr. Shue! Hey!
Whoa...
Welcome to Geneva Hall,
aka Chez Puckerman.
Noah, I-I didn't know
you were enrolled here. Well,
I'm not technically enrolled,
but, you know, I'm just
auditing a few classes.
Do you even know
what that means?
Got to go.
Like I do
Nobody can do the
Like I do, nobody can do the
Like I do, nobody can do
Looks like you're really
having the college experience.
I hope you're finding time
to make it to class.
You know, Mr. Shue, I don't
need you to come into my house
and tell me how to live my life.
You're right.
Look, I-I came here
to apologize.
I was still stinging from
what happened at the wedding
and then when you told me
about... kissing Emma,
I totally mishandled
the situation.
And now I really see that we only
have so many days, you know?
I want you to come back and
help me coach the glee club.
They need you.
I need you.
PUCK: Finn! I just got us invited
to the Delta Kappa Chi frat party
tonight. It's supposed to be the
biggest party of the year. Yeah!
Yeah!
I got to shave my hello giggles.
Good to see you, Mr. Shue.
Yeah.
Thanks, Puck.
Thanks, but no, thanks.
I'm not expecting things to just
go back to normal right away.
I'm willing to work at this.
Well, I'm not.
There's just some things
you can't come back from.
It's a nice offer,
but as you can see,
I'm pretty busy with college.
Like I do, nobody can
do the
Like I do
Nobody can do the
Like I do
Nobody can do the
Like I do...
All right,
guys, let's get right into it.
And remember,
the trick is the change
in vocal quality
from the smooth,
sultry sounds of Gary Wright
to the commanding
tone of Annie Lennox,
and then back to the poppy fun
of Darryl Hall.
Uh, Mr. Shue?
Um, we kind of got
together as a group
after you gave us
these songs yesterday, and
we came up with
some... alternatives.
Why would you do that?
Mm, you might need some woman
parts to help you sell that.
I'll go get Evan.
Sam, sit down.
Honestly, I don't even know
what's going on
in this room anymore.
What happened to you guys?
Openly defying me?
Unique, you need
to tone it down
with the whole boob thing.
Sam, we all know you
don't have a twin brother,
and frankly, it's distracting.
And, Blaine, I am
disappointed in you
for allowing this to go on.
I'm sorry,
but we're just trying to...
No, what you were trying
to do is not rehearsing
the song list that I gave you,
and that is unacceptable.
So here's what's
going to happen.
I'm going to go
to the teachers' lounge
and get the coffee that I
skipped to get here early,
and when I get back
in five minutes,
you  be ready
to rehearse... my songs.
Okay, so let's start
with the  classics.
I know them by heart.
But anyway, I just
want to go over...
I always seem to find you
the piano, rehearsing.
Shelby.
Oh, my God,
what are you doing here?!
I'm trying to track you down.
I wanted to find you before
your  audition.
You found out about that?
We're Facebook
friends, Rachel. You
started posting as Barbra.
I noticed.
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I just felt... a little weird.
You know, I know
that you have the same affection
with  as I do, and I just...
You didn't want to remind me
that I never got to play the
role, and now it's too late?
I love my life. I do.
It's not the life that I
always imagined I'd be living,
but I have Beth, and I have
this new Broadway
Daycare business,
and we're both in
the same city now,
so I get to see you a lot more.
I have no regrets.
In fact, as much as it was
my dream to maybe study
at a school like NYADA, and, um,
perform songs like that
on a Broadway stage... Shelby.
...my bigger, better
dream now is to see my
incredibly beautiful daughter
perform those songs.
Just... not at
your audition.
Honey, you can't do Barbra.
What?!
No. Fanny Brice is
the most iconic role.
Okay, this is...
this is the only way to do it.
Yeah, Hamlet's an iconic role,
and it's been done differently
and successfully by Laurence
Olivier, Kenneth Branagh,
Richard Burton, Keanu Reeves...
Okay, Hamlet is different.
This is Fanny.
Yes, and they cast Barbra
as Fanny
because she was one-of-a-kind.
She was an original.
If the producers are smart,
they're not gonna be
looking for some carbon copy.
They're gonna want a fresh
interpretation, someone
that can put their own stamp
on the role.
Well, I've just been learning.
Barbra's entire
repertoire, so...
It's okay. You have time.
We'll find something.
I'll help you.
This may not be 100% right,
but maybe it will inspire you.
And any excuse
to sing next to you.
You won't find him
drinking on the tables
Rolling dice
or staying out till 3:00
You won't ever find him
being unfaithful
You will find him
You'll find him next to me
You won't find him
trying to chase the devil
For money, fame,
for power, out of greed
You won't ever find him
where the rest go
You will find him,
you'll find him next to me
Next to me  Next to me
BOTH :
Oh, oh
Next to me  Next to me
Oh, oh
Next to me  Next to me
Oh, oh
Ooh, I will find him,
I'll find him next to me
When the end has come
And buildings
falling down fast
When we've spoilt the land
and dried up all the sea
When everyone has lost
their heads around us
BOTH:  You will find him,
you'll find him next to me
Next to me  Next to me
Oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, next to me
BOTH:
Ooh, ooh
Next to me, yeah
Oh, whoa-oh, whoa
You will find him,
you'll find him
Next to me
Next to me, yeah
Next to me
BOTH:
Next to me, yeah, yeah
Next to me
Next to me
BOTH:
Yeah, yeah
BOTH:  You will find him,
you'll find him
Next to me, yeah
Kick it!
You wake up late for school,
man, you don't want to go
You ask your mom, "Please,"
but she still says, "No!"
You missed two classes
and no homework
But your teacher
preaches class
Like you're some kind
of jerk
You got to fight
For your right
To party
Your pops caught you smoking,
man, he said, "No way"
That hypocrite smokes
two packs a day
Man, living at home
is such a drag
Now your mom threw away
your best porno mag
Busted
You gotta fight
For your right
To party
You gotta fight
For your right
To party
Yay!
Par... ty
Par... ty
Part...
Fight for your right!
...ty.
Oh!
Dude, that was awesome!
Dudes. Dudes, I'm Matt Cromley,
house president.
This is Chip.
He's in charge of pledging.
You guys want us to
pledge or something?
Under normal circumstances,
we'd ask you to pledge.
Then you'd have to go through
a six-week hazing program.
But dudes, this is
our biggest party of the year,
and when the stereo broke,
we all thought it was ruined.
CHIP: You saved our
house and its honor
and its position
as top party house on campus.
Well, Puck and I... we do
have musical training.
Glee club?
That's awesome.
So, listen, even though
you guys are apparently gay,
we'd like to invite you
to become brothers here.
No hazing or anything.
Just say yes, and you're in.
Yeah.
The sacred ritual of partying!
Oh! Yeah!
Yeah!
Man.
Whoa...
Yeah!
I'm also naturally
enhancing my breasts.
Every night, I rub
them with cocoa butter,
Vitamin E and wild yams.
Yes, uh, has anybody,
uh, seen Sam?
Yeah, I think
he's behind that curtain.
Sorry I'm late.
What's up, Marley? Brad?
Uh, I wrote a song.
I don't know if it's any good.
I just... I want
to hear it out loud.
And no,
or bad Taylor Swift
boyfriend drama.
It's about
how much
friends like you mean to me.
Lord, I am crying already.
I just saw how upset you guys
got after Mr. Shue yelled at us,
and you three seemed
to take the worst part of it.
So, I wrote this song
to make you
feel better,
as corny as that sounds.
Will you sing it with me?
No. Just kidding.
Of course we would.
Hit it, dude.
Ooh, ooh-ooh
We feel
We hear
Your pain
Your fear
But we're here
To say
Who you are
Is okay
And you don't have
to go through this
On your own
You're not
Alone
You have
More friends than you know
Some who surround you
Some you are destined
to meet
You'll have more love
in your life
Don't let go, give it time
Take it slow
Those who love you the most
May need more time to grow
It's gonna be okay
You have more friends
than you know
Be who you are
Learn to forgive
It's not about who you love
But how  But how
How you live How you live
O-Oh
O-Oh
You
Have
More
Friends than you know
Than you know some who
Surround you  Yeah
Some you are
destined to meet
To meet
You have more  More
Love in your life
Don't let go
Give it time
Take it slow
Take it slow
Those who love you the most
May need more time to
Grow
Oh
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
You have
More friends
Than you
Know
It's gonna be okay.
BLAINE:
Marley, that was
incredible.
Child, it's the soundtrack
to my life.
Do you have any more
songs like these?
Yeah, a couple.
Maybe we can meet up
again and sing them.
No. Forget that. No, what we
need to do is tell everyone.
We have to tell Mr. Shue about this.
MARLEY: No.
He made it pretty clear
he's not interested.
You're probably still pissed
about Brody,
so I'll start by saying
that I'm sorry
and that my hand still hurts.
His face has sharp edges.
Okay, I'm-I'm not...
I'm not mad, I...
Actually, I think I owe
you a debt of gratitude.
Just, um...
you know, I wish that you
would've stayed and...
hung around a little longer.
Next time, I promise.
So, how is college?
It's a dream come true.
Parties with Puck...
Puck? Puck is there?
Yeah, he's here.
Long story, but...
it's amazing.
Every night, we go out,
we-we're meeting new people...
Well, then, that sounds amazing.
I'm... it's really great.
I, uh, actually I just,
I needed to, um,
to ask you something.
Let me guess:
auditions.
I knew you'd remember.
Finn, I can't believe
that this moment is happening,
and I know that
this is a long shot,
but I need to find
the most perfect song to sing,
and-and-and no Barbra.
You're one of the most
unique talents in the world.
You always shine your brightest
when you do something
personal, something
intimately important
that defines you.
So just do something
that takes you back
to the roots of your passion.
That's what people want to see,
and that's what makes
the best impression.
Make those producers
fall in love with you
in that moment on the stage.
And I know you have it in you.
Wow.
Thank you, that was, uh...
perfect advice.
You'll be great.
Can't wait to come
to a show sometime.
Call me as soon
as it's over, okay?
I will.
Thank you for... that.
We will let you know.
Thanks.
This is what you get
for holding an open cattle call
for
Let me just put a little
"yikes" next to her name.
Told you we should
have made an offer
to Miley Cyrus.
All right.
Let's just plow ahead, shall we?
Rachel Berry,
hit the stage, you're up.
Um... hi.
I'm Rachel Berry, and I'll be
singing a classic.
Oh
Just a small town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train
Going anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised
in South Detroit
He took the midnight train
Going anywhere
A singer in a smoky room
A smell of wine
and cheap perfume
For a smile they can
share the night
It goes on and on
and on and on
Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows
Searching in the
Night
Oh, streetlights
People
Livin'
Just to find emotion
Hiding
Somewhere
In the night
Oh, whoa
Don't stop
Believin'
Hold onto that feeling
Streetlights
People
Don't stop believin'
Hold on
Streetlights people
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't stop.
WOMAN:
Well,
thank you, Ms.... Berry.
That was something...
quite different.
Sorry.
What?
Rachel.
Suddenly, something
happened to you
in the middle of the song.
What was going on there?
I was thinking
about my friends.
Um, how I wouldn't be
the person I am today,
standing in front of you,
doing what I'm doing
right now if they hadn't
shown me that I could.
If they hadn't believed in me.
Thank you.
Dude...
Dude, yourself.
What the hell is this?
Uh, it's from my sociology prof.
Guess I missed another test.
No biggie.
Crap, what time is it?
I'm late to play Frolf
with that Cromley guy.
Dude, it is a biggie.
It's a very biggie.
Isn't that class one of your
requirements for your teaching major?
Don't worry,
I'm gonna pass that class.
The... the final's worth,
like, 60% of the grade.
I'll just cram and ace it.
Is that your dream?
To barely skate through school
and become a mediocre teacher?
Wait, since when do you care
about school so much, man?
You're not even in school.
Dude.
This isn't high school anymore.
It's not just about potential.
This is the real casaba.
So you're a crappy
high school student.
Who cares?
But if you're a crappy teacher,
that means something.
Look.
This has been awesome.
I'm having the time of my life.
And doing it with my best bud
is a dream come true.
But last night, I was
in bed with three chicks,
and I was thinking,
"What is this all about
for you, Puckerman?"
So, what'd you come up with?
I want to show all of 'em.
Everyone who ever
crossed the street
when I came down the sidewalk
or didn't call on me in class
'cause they just assumed
I'd fart my answer,
or told me I'd be
pumping gas someday
that we are worth something.
That we are more
than they say we are.
I'm not saying we
need to stop having
a good time,
but partying this hard,
skipping out on tests,
that's their vision
of who we are.
Doesn't have to be ours.
So what are you gonna do,
like, enroll here now?
I still think school's
for suckers,
but I'm gonna stay here
and write my screenplay
and be on your ass
that you become
the best teacher
that you can be.
We've always known
we were special.
This is our chance to prove it.
Yeah.
Ew.
Get to work.
I'll grab the iron and make us
some grilled cheeses.
Mm.
You wanted to see us, Coach?
Yes.
Come on in and have a seat.
It is my understanding
that I have inherited you
as co-captains
of the Cheerios!
And by looking at the
two of you right now,
that makes me
extremely suspicious.
Suspicious? Why?
Oh, I understand why.
Coach Sylvester's
daughter Robin is here.
Sue Sylvester
is as old as the hills,
so when she gave birth
to her fully grown,
Down syndrome, it was
a miracle, and she wanted
to bring her to school every day
and show her off.
You're the one that makes
me suspicious,
Fruity Fonzie.
You ain't never done
a cheerleading routine
in your life,
but somehow you get.
Sue Sylvester to make you
co-captain of the Cheerios!,
and then, three weeks later,
out of nowhere,
Sue Sylvester gets fired.
That makes me
real suspicious.
That makes me think
that you used your handsome
fruity voodoo powers
and put a hex on her
that caused her to bring a gun
to school for no reason
and get real clumsy
so she drops it twice
and it goes off both times.
That sounds like
some dark-sided, fruity
voodoo stuff to me.
But that didn't really happen!
Blaine had nothing
to do with it!
How do you know?
Were you there?
No.
Exactly.
So here's
the deal... if you
want to stay
on board as co-captain
of the Cheerios!,
you're gonna have to take
a blood oath and loyalty pledge.
What? A blood oath?
Is-is that even safe?
Probably not.
So we'll just take the oath.
Repeat after me.
I, Fruity Fonzie
and adult baby Robin...
BOTH: I, Fruity Fonzie
and adult baby Robin...
...do solemnly swear... BOTH:.
..do solemnly swear...
...to  put a hex
on Coach Roz Washington.
To
hex on Coach Roz Washington. To...
on Coach Roz Washington.
Causing her to bring a gun to
school so she gets real clumsy
and drops it and it goes off
twice in a row.
BOTH: Causing her to
bring a gun to school
so she gets real clumsy
and drops it
so it goes off twice in a row.
So help me God.
BOTH:
So help me God.
You are free to go.
Becky, wait up.
Hurry up, I'm gonna be
late for calculus.
Becky, um, you were acting
particularly strange
in there just now.
Do you know something I don't
about what happened
with Coach Sue?
Mind your own gay business,
gay Blaine.
I don't know anything!
FINN: Mr. Shue?
You were right.
About what?
Me.
N-Needing to get my focus back.
So I-I talked to the Dean
of Students about your offer,
and she said she's willing
to give me college credit
for all the time
that I spend here helping out.
Is that your way of saying
apology accepted?
That's my way of saying
I'm willing to come back.
But if I do,
things have got to be different.
No more fetching your coffee
or picking up
your dry cleaning.
I mean, I don't want
to come back to be a gopher.
It's got to be a partnership.
I want to be treated
like an equal.
Like a...
like a teacher.
And then you bring your best
and I bring my best
and we go get another trophy.
That all seems fair.
But I also have a condition.
Let's just move past this.
Right.
Looking good, Unique.
You, too, Tina.
Very Jules Verne.
Hey, Blaine. Sam.
I'm Evan. Sam moved to Alaska.
Oh. Well-well, tell him
he's welcome back anytime.
So... just about 20 years ago,
I was sitting right
where you are now.
I was co-captain
of the soccer team
with a forehead full of acne
and a dream of being
the next Vanilla Ice.
And standing
right here was Mrs. Adler.
She constantly mumbled
to herself and
she stuffed used Kleenex
up her sleeves.
We all were convinced
that she was crazy.
But you know what?
That's why we loved her...
because we were crazy, too.
This is the room
that always felt like home.
Maybe because we knew
Lillian Adler loved music
almost as much as she loved us.
And that's how I feel about you.
Every one of you.
And-and I'm sorry
if I made any of you feel
like you don't have
a voice in this room.
You do.
And I know someone else
who does, too.
ARTIE: My man!
Finn and I are gonna be
working together as a team.
Equal partners.
And we are not gonna
eat, sleep or breathe
until you've blasted
through regionals
and earned your rightful spot
at nationals.
Yes! Yes!
All right, down to business.
Marley, you're up.
Okay.
I haven't quite memorized
"Dream Weaver" yet,
but I think I have "Sweet
Dreams." Didn't I tell you?
Those are out.
I want you to teach us one
of your original songs.
If that's okay.
I'd love that.
So shall it be written!
So shall it be done!
So, what is Broadway
Daycare exactly?
All the show people who have
kids... while they're rehearsing
or performing... they send them
to Shelby's studio
and she teaches them,
like, dance routines
and songs and plays
theatre games with them.
It's like  for toddlers.
Well,
no news is good news, right?
Cookie?
At this point, if I haven't
heard anything...
Life goes on.
You know,
Fanny was just a dream.
I read on BroadwayWorld.com that they're
doing a production of
at the Pasadena Playhouse,
and... I don't know... I think.
Johanna could be a good role for me.
Do you regret
not doing Barbra
for the audition?
No way.
Honestly, something so special
and something magical
happened in that room, and
if those producers are too...
narrow-minded
or star-obsessed...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, it's a number
I don't recognize.
What do I do? What do I do?
Uh,
ans-ans-answer it. Answer it. Yes, yes, yes.
Pick it up? Okay.
Hello?
Uh, yes, this is she.
Uh, yeah, of-of cour...
of course.
Yes. Yes.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
That was...
one of the producers.
And?
And I got a callback for Fanny!
I got a callback!
Who's to say
Who's not okay?
The breakaways
Will outlast, will outlast
Sticks and stones
Will break these bones
They're just some drones
To get past, I'll get past
Feeling downcast
Like an outcast
Underdogs it's time to
It's time to bite back
We are, we are, we are
Stronger from every scar
Brighter than any star
We're the outcast
Ou-Ou-Outcast
There's nothing you can say
To blow our dreams away
We rise above the fray
We're the outcast
Ou-Ou-Outcast
I'd rather be outrageous
than
Just another
dull cliché again
I'd rather be a rainbow than
Just some shade of gray
We are, we are, we are
Stronger from every scar
Brighter than any star
The outcast
The outcast
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Stronger from every scar
The outcast, ou-ou-outcast
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Brighter than any star
We're the outcast,
ou-ou-outcast
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
We are, we are, we are
The outcast,
ou-ou-outcast.
