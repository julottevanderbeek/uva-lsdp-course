A weird thing happened last night

The first time l saw Jerry on TV.
l knew that there was hope for me.
When l saw how he worked the crowd.
l knew that he could help me out.
Before that. l was empty inside.
l had considered suicide.
But now l'm a vital member
of Jerry's team.
But sometimes l wonder
how much he values me.
What the fuck is that
idiot warm-up man doing out there?
He's turning my people
into a mob.
You're right. Steve. he's got to go.
Hey. Jerry. what can l say. man?
Tough crowd.
Nice to see you. Jonathan.
Sorry if l let those assholes
get a little too loud.
Those assholes are my audience.
Jerry. don't bullshit me.
You and me both.
we know they are scum.
Filthy cocksucking scum.
Your job is to control those scum
and keep them from
upstaging my guests.
Pimps and perverts. teenage whores.
people so fat they get
stuck in revolving doors.
And we get them through those doors
and onto a plane to Chicago.
Sluts and faggots.
gimps eating maggots.
We never had a maggot-eating gimp
on this show.
- Jerry. you could do anything.
- What are you talking about?
You could run for Senate
or even president.
lf l want my dick sucked.
l'll call my agent.
Looks like you're cruising.
playing it safe.
You're way out of line. pal.
You need a challenge
and l got just the thing.
Gonna make you sweat
when you're in the ring.
Jonathan. let's cut this short.
You need help. Help and a new job.
No! You...
So thanks for this little chat.
Oh. and good luck
in the warm-up industry.
Sorry. faggots. if l'm outta line.
Sorry if l'm taking
too much of your time.
Mister Fucking Big Shot.
sun shines out his ass.
take your job and shove it.
It's been such a blast.
That's the last we'll see of him.
Fuck you. Fuck you.
Fuck you. Fuck you.
l'm so lonely.
That went well.
You know. when l was a younger man.
l was passionate about civil rights.
education. the antiwar movement.
l was even elected
to the city council.
And then one day.
l. er. l went to a prostitute.
and l paid her with a cheque.
Next day it was all over.
But l faced up to it.
And later l was elected mayor
of Cincinnati.
That's the third largest city...
in Ohio.
There are only two things you need
to know about politics. One.
you'll never get anywhere unless

with Shawntel's pole-dancing dreams?

She's tired of laughing.

But we've got another guest
who's none too happy
with your choice of career.
Your mother Irene.
lt has no name.
lt is a whore.
- It has no name.
- Momma.
- It is a whore.
- Momma.
- It will burn.
- Momma.
- It will fry.
- Momma.
You're just a sack of misery.
Everything you touch turns to cancer.
Hope you die
slow with pain swimming
round your ugly ass.
your skanky sorry ass.
Welcome to the show. Irene.
l. erm. sense some hostility
towards your daughter.
Some are descended from angels.
Others are descended from apes.
Some are the result of romantic love.
Others the result of rapes.
Well. l wish she'd died at birth.
And l wish you'd died at birth. too.
Well. at least you agree
on one thing.
So. Chucky.
how do you fit into all of this?
lf she don't stop.
l'll find me another woman.
What you gonna do?
Buy her or drug her?
Gonna find me something to replace
her tainted. sagging old skin.
Good. Good.
l'm tired of your little dick flesh.
lt's so small l get more pleasure
from fucking myself
with my own clitoris.
All women are whores.
Whores or sluts or prostitutes.
You don't know shit.
You don't know shit.
He's just an inbred
three-nippled cousin-fucker.
lnbreed three-nippled cousin-fucker.
Three-nippled cousin-fuck...
lnbreed three-nippled cousin-fucker.
Three-nippled cousin-fuck...
Three-nippled cousin-fuck...
Three-nippled cousin-fucker.
You're the innocent one here. Chucky.
l ain't easy. but l'm honest.
So. no secrets. then?
l like flowers more than people.
No. Jerry.
Well. that's strange. Chucky.
because we followed you around
with our secret camera. the Jerrycam.
And to be honest. we were
a little surprised by what we saw.
He came. he saw. he Jerrycam.
He came. he saw. he Jerrycam.
Vení, vídí, Jerrycam.
Vení, vídí, Jerrycam.
Adoremus Jerrycam.
Benedictus Jerry fucking...
Bring on the Klan.
No. not the fucking Klan.
Bring on the Klan.
No. not the fucking Klan.
No. not the fucking Klan.
Well. l guess it would be rude not
to. Please welcome the Ku Klux Klan.
Come on. boys.
Come on.
Get your fuckin' hands off of me.
You fucked-up...
This is our Jerry Springer moment.
We don't want this moment to die.
So dip us in chocolate
and throw us to the lesbians.
We don't want this moment to die.
Jews and blacks will go to hell.
New York Democrats as well.
We don't want this moment to
die.
Die.
Die.
Die.
Die.
Die.
Die.
Die.
Die.
Die.
Die.
We're running out of time.
My final thought.
Die.
l've been shot.
l'm confused. Why would l get shot?
Wow! That's some medication
they got me on.
Jerry. Jerry.
Jerry. Jerry.
Jerry. Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.
Jerry. Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.
- Jerry.
- Oh. Jerry.
Jerry.
Are you sure that's mine?
l never eat sweet corn.
Steve!
lt's good to see you.
Oh. you never let me down.
But you didn't take that bullet.
Just kidding.
Jerry. Jerry.
Jerry. Jerry.
Jerry. Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.
Jerry. Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.
- Jerry.
- Oh. Jerry.
Jerry.
Steve. how cool is this?
Singing nurses.
a giant cigar
and. look. my own moving chair.
ls there a problem here?
Visitors.
l hope they brought me some grapes.
We eat. excrete and watch TV.
And you are there for us. Jerry.
Jerry. can you understand?
We sit out in nowhereland.
wanting and yearning.
our bloated stomachs churning.
Eat. excrete and watch TV.
You are there for us. Jerry.
Steve. let me get this straight.
- You eat. excrete...
- And watch TV.
- But l am there for you?
- Jerry.
Steve. what exactly
are they saying here?
Jerry. you're so diflicult.
They're exactly saying
that they eat. excrete and watch TV
but you are there for them. Jerry.
Oh. well. it's so nice of you guys to
take time out of your day to drop by.
l never knew l had so many friends.
So. how's it going with you guys?
To be frank. pretty fucked.
Well. l can sympathise.
Ratings are low.
l've got a class-action suit pending.
Not to mention
this bullet-wound-in-the-chest thing.
Come and see.
Come and see what you have done
to me.
Steve. this sounds like lawyer talk.
Don't say anything.
One day you're 17.
Then just before you're 18. 18.
suddenly. suddenly.
you realise you're 56.
ahead of you.
You're one good-looking woman.
He was handsome.
He was smart.
He betrayed every friend.
He broke every heart.
But one day he awoke
to a scene that made him heave.
He'd been drugged up and fucked
by some sailors on leave.
Sailors on leave.
Hired and paid for by me.
You hired him a sailor. Shawntel?
Jeez. Chucky. you're a lucky guy.
All my wife ever got me
was a reflexologist.
l came home from a titty bar.
where l'd spent all night.
She covers me in kerosene
and sets me fucking alight.
Fry!
You set him on fire.
your husband of 15 years?
What was it. your anniversay?
Light of my life.
fire of my loins.
lover and laugher
and drinker and friend.
You stole my dreams.
You broke my jaw.
But you said you were Sorry
so l came back for more.
Stupid whore.
Came back for more.
Stupid whore.
Came back for more.
More. more.
More. more.
More.
You know. if there's one thing that
really sickens me. it's violence.
Unless it's on TV. in
a carefully controlled environment.
When you fall in love.
it could last forever.
But usually it lasts about a month.
So l shot myself in the head
but l missed and ended up half dead.
Now there's a hole
where my brain used to be.
l'm hooked to a monitor.
l find it hard to pee.
l slur and l dribble
and l live off my drip feed
but l still can get a hard-on
if l jerk till l bleed.
Jerk
till l bleed.
Jerk till l bleed.
Jerk till l bleed.
At least something good
came out of it.
l made love
to a dying man.
l knew he was dying
cos l was holding the pillow
over his face.
Steve. l think we'd better
get out of here.
There is only one cure
for unrequited love.
Chocolate and howling at the moon.
Eat. excrete and watch TV.
Eat. excrete and watch TV.
You know what? It's been great
catching up with you guys.
And you've taken some knocks.
but you've gotta pick yourselves up.
Dust yourselves off
and have a magical day.
Behind you. Behind you.
Behind you.
Díes Irae.
Díes Irae.
What now?
Dead woman walking.
Dead woman walking.
Baby Jane. you look like shit.
What happened to you?
Momma gave me smack on the asshole.
Momma gave me smack on the head.
But Momma gave me smack
with a monkey wrench
and now l am dead.
You know. Steve.
a person with less broadcasting
experience might feel responsible.
Your dreams take place in Manhattan.
Ours take place in Minnesota.
Your dreams are driven in a Bentley.
Ours in a rusty Skoda.
Big dreams
and small dreams.
like all dreams
just stay dreams.
l guess this must be
what guilt feels like.
That was my Jerry Springer moment.
l didn't want that moment
to die.
Seen all over the planet
on worldwide TV.
except developing countries
and Germany.
You know, l'll never understand why they
didn't pick the show up in Germany.
But don't get me started.
Oh. how my heart
aches for love.
Aches for love.
Oh. how my heart
aches for love.
Aches for love.
- Oh. how my heart
- Oh. how my heart
- Oh. how my heart
- Oh. how my heart
Aches.
Aches.
Aches.
Alright. let's clear up
a basic misunderstanding right now.
You all wanted to come on the show.
You all had your 15 seconds of fame.
You all got to stay
in a three-star hotel.
You all got an expenses-paid trip.
Minus minibar bills, Chucky,
to Chicago.
And. remember. that's Chicago.
the Windy City.
The city of. of...
wind.
You all knew the risks.
You signed the disclaimer.
So stop breaking my balls
and get out of my...
Steve. where the fuck are we?
Jerry. Jerry.
You have been chosen.
Chosen?
ls that a good thing?
Could you be a little more specific?
Chosen.
- Chosen.
- Chosen for what?
Will you people stop fucking with me?
Lo! He comes.
Lo! He comes.
Oh. great! It's that loser
warm-up guy. Jonathan Wierus.
Wrong. Him am the devil.
- Ooh. yes. l'm evil.
- Him am not good.
The opposite. in fact.
ln fact. him a total cunt.
One way of putting it.
Him act as total cunt should.
What a cunt.
What a cunt.
What a cunting. cunting.
cunting. cunting cunt.
- You're telling me you're the devil?
- Yes.
lt takes more than a little red suit
to be the devil.
Steve. throw this psycho out of here.
l don't think so.
N-N-N-N-N...
- Steve !
- Naughty.
- N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Naughty.
- Steve. Steve!
OK. OK. hang on. hang on.
So maybe l was a little hasty
with that firing thing.
That is of no concern.
Though it was not what l deserved.
l simply come to take you down
to hell where you will...
Serve.
Whoa. whoa. whoa! Time out!
Let's rewind this a little.
Now. l don't want to serve in hell.
At this stage in my career.
that would be a sideways move.
Come. Jerry. gird your loins.
for we must journey south of heaven.
Step into this elevator and set
a course for the basement level.
Fall with me.
- Fall with him.
- l've got a table booked at The Ivy.
lf you're proud and you walk tall.
you only got further to fall.
Like the apple on the tree.
you'll soon succumb to gravity.
Fall with me.
Fall with him.
Fall. fall. fall. fall. fall. fall.
Fall. fall. fall. fall. fall. fall.
Doesn't matter what you are.
prince or pauper. king or clown.
there is no greater act of love
than going down.
- Going down with me.
- Steve!
- Going down with him.
- l can't go to hell. l'm Jewish.
Surrender your mortal soul.
Let life swallow you up whole.
Wipe off that suspicious frown.
cos. baby. we all gotta go down.
- The white man.
- Gotta go down.
- The black man.
- Gotta go down.
The red man. green man.
pink man. beige man.
Gotta go. gotta go d-d-down.
d-d-down.
- The tax man.
- Down.
- The gas man.
- Down.
- The VAT man.
- Down.
- The weatherman.
- Down.
- The snowman.
- Down.
- The doorman.
- Down.
- The woman man.
- Down.
Down. down.
Down. down.
Down. down.
Down. down.
Wait.
Prince of Darkness.
punish him not.
Jerry is not to blame.
With or without Jerry's show.
we'd all end up the same.
Men and women. black and white.
transsexual girls and boys.
the burned and crippled.
blind. the maimed.
distorted.
destroyed.
For society
has an ugly face.
Contorted.
smeared with shit.
Jerry did not make it so.
He merely holds a mirror to it.
That's right. what she said there.
l do the mirror thing.
Tell him again. Tell him again.
- The Wicker Man.
- Gotta go down.
- Elephant Man.
- Gotta go down.
- The Piltdown Man.
- Gotta go down.
- The blah-blah man.
- Gotta go down.
Blah. blah. blah. blah.
- Blah.
- Blah. blah-blah. blah-blah. blah.
- Blah. blah-blah. blah-blah. blah.
- Blah. blah.
The man with hair
and the man with none.
the man with the knife
and the man with the gun.
the man on the moon
and the man on the farm.
the man with a needle
stuck in his arm.
the man on the crapper
with voices in his head.
the man who wishes
evey other man was dead.
the man with ten kids
and a loving wife.
the man who has nothing
to show for his life.
Every last motherfucker
should go down.
Every last motherfucker
should go down.
Every last motherfucker
should go down.
- Down.
- Wait a minute.
l'm confused here.
Why are you dragging me down to hell?
l don't deserve this.
l'm not a bad guy.
l just got lucky. that's all.
l mean. Jesus. is that a sin?
- No.
- You see? They agree.
l take you to hell
to solve a problem
that's been chapping my ass
since the dawn of time.
Since the dawn of time.
You've got the wrong guy.
l don't solve problems.
l just televise them.
Now. what do you want from me?
l want you to do a show for me.
Wait, let me get this straight.
You want me to do a show for you.
the devil. in hell?
Look. l'm under exclusive contract
to USA Studios.
They've got a whole
building full of lawyers.
You'd have to talk to the head of
the company and he's not here right now.
Yes. he is. Yes. he is.
Show business.
Razzle-dazzle. Razzle-dazzle.
Show business.
Do your greatest show for me.
Turn chaos into harmony.
- And if l refuse?
- For all eternity.
you will be. you will be...
Fried and flambéed.
Baked and sautéed.
- Steamed and stewed.
- Then.
- Barbecued
- Then.
- Grilled and roasted.
- Then.
Lightly toasted.
- Then. then. then. then.
- Then. what?
Fucked up the ass
with barbed wire.
OK. so that's the downside.
So. what's the upside if l succeed
in this? What's in it for me?
Not getting ass-fucked
with barbed wire.
So. what are the hours?
Jerry is going to hell.
- No. no. no. no. no.
- Hot enough for ya?
Hot enough for ya?
- Jerry's going...
- No!
..to hell.
Hell.
Hell.
Hell.
Hot enough for ya?
Hot enough for ya?
Hot enough for ya?
Hot enough for ya?
Demons and devils.
incubi and succubi
and princes and princesses of hell.
welcome for one night only
or perhaps for all eternity.
He's bigger than the planet earth.
Bigger than the biggest big.
Biggie. biggie. biggie. big.
Biggie. biggie. biggie. biggie. big.
- Lo! He comes.
- Jerry. Jerry. Jerry. Jerry.
- Lo! He comes.

Laudamus Jerry.
- Te adoremus.
- Biggie. biggie. big.
Big.
Steve. this all seems
strangely familiar.
Baby Jane.
- So. what am l supposed to do?
- Just say the cards.
Hello and welcome to a very special
edition of The Jerry Sprínger Show.
That's me. That's my show.
You know. from time immemorial.
heaven and hell have been at war.
But is there a way of reconciling
the irreconcilable
and giving both parties some sense
of closure and a chance to move on?
Hey. wait a minute.
Look. l don't do. never have done
and never will do
conflict resolution.
- Then you will fy.
- Please welcome my first guest.
the Prince of Darkness. Satan.
- Satan. Satan.
- Go. Satan. go.
Satan. Satan.
Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan.
Satan. Satan. Sa...
Once in happy realms of light.
l was transcendental.
golden
and bright.
Bright.
But l rebelled and was cast down.
forced to surrender
my celestial crown.
Oh.
My Crown.
Oh.
Then God hurled me from the skies.
not merciful enough
to let
me die.
Let me die.
Confounded.
immortal l.
Paradise
lost
and pain eternal.
Pain eternal.
You seem upset.
So. what exactly do you want?
l want it to be just like old times.
with Baby Jesus by my side.
l want my old wings back. as well.
Wanna get out of this dump
called hell.
But first and most importantly.
l want a fucking apology.
- Apology.
- An apology?
You instigated a coup d'état
against God in heaven.
You went down to earth and you led
mankind into a whole world of shit.
And you want me to get
the good guys to apologise to you?
Are you out of your mind?
How in hell am l supposed to do that?
Just read the cards.
This is your handwriting. l suppose.
Let's see if we can get an apology
from my next guest.
the hypocrite son
of the fascist tyrant on high.
Jesus of Nazareth.
Jesus. Jesus. what the fuck?
Coming here. pushing his luck.
Make him wear a thorny crown.
Grab his pants and pull them down.
Old friend.
old foe.
l missed you.
Jesus. what a beautiful moment.
Jesus.
Satan has something
he wants to say to you.
Go ahead. Satan.

- Apologise.
- Son of Man.
lt ain't gonna happen.
Sit down on your ass.
lt ain't gonna happen.
Sit down on your ass.
Jesus. Jesus. Jesus!
Give me a second.
Satan. what are you doing here?
You're making the situation worse.
Jesus has flown a long way
to be here today.
This is not his neighbourhood.
Show him a little courtesy.
So he turned some water into wine.
Ooh!
So he walked across
the frickin' seas.
Ooh!
So you got yourself crucified.
Here's a little biscuit from me.
l am Jesus.
Son of Man.
son of Mary.
son of God.
So do not.
do not.
do not fuck with me!
Ooh. scared.
l do not want your biscuit.
l want your love
and your respect.
For l am love
and l love all mankind.
- Jesus is gay.
- Pathetic!
- Jesus is gay.
- Gimme a break!
G-A-Y. gay! G-A-Y. gay!
Actually.
l am a bit gay.
G-A-Y. gay! G-A-Y. gay!
- G-A-Y. gay! G-A-Y. gay!
- Satan.
Satan.
between you and me.
if you want to achieve anything here.
you and your people are going
to have to work with me on this.
Just read the cards.
Oh. Jesus!
You call yourself Jesus
but you are not worthy of the name.
- Who wrote this shit?
- The cards.
Let's meet two other guests who are
also after an apology from Jesus.
He was fashioned
from a lump of clay.
And she showed kindness to a snake.
The mother and father of humanity.
Adam and Eve.
Put your fucking clothes on.
you stupid bitch.
- Don't you touch me...
- You stupid bitch!
- ..or l'll kill you in your sleep.
- You stupid bitch.
- Cocksucker. Talk to the ass.
- You look ridiculous.
- Talk to the ass.
- She looks ridiculous.
Welcome to the show.
How's the relationship going?
All women are whores.
Whores or sluts or prostitutes.
He don't know shit.
He don't know shit.
He's just a piece of...
- Shut it. Slut!
- Shut it. Gimp!
Whatever.
Putting aside your domestic
grievances for just a moment.
Eve. what is it
you want to say to Jesus?
- For one little apple...
- Don't talk to me. Talk to Jesus.
For one little apple
on a little tree.
we get a life of grief and misey.
She made me do it.
made me do it.
You had your chance and you blew it.
Forbidden fruit.
Forbidden fruit.
But vegetables allowed.
- God's plan.
- One little apple.
- God's plan.
- Just a little apple.
- She made me do it. made me do it.
- God's plan. God's plan.
Just a little apple.
One little apple.
- Just a little apple.
- Blame it on the snake. man.
One little apple.
- Just a little apple.
- God's plan.
What the fuck? What the fuck?
What the fucking. fucking fuck?
That's just great. Jesus.
You hit a woman.
l think you should
apologise to her.
You followed the way
of ambition and vanity.
But it was me
who had to redeem humanity.
You're weeping now
but you didn't give a toss
when l was crying out.
crying out.
crying out on the cross.
On the cross.
- On the cross.
- Always with the crucifixion.
Whatever!
That was 2,000 years ago.
lnstead of banging on about it.
why don't you get over it
and give us all a fucking break?
Enough of this shit. Get on with it.
l'm trying to get on with it.
l'm trying to get you your apology.
but this is an impossible situation.
Fucked up the ass
with barbed wire.
l'm not going to read this.
There's no point.
Barbed wire.
Well. Satan.
we've got a surprise guest
who wants to give
her version of events.
Please welcome the teenage mother
of Jesus. Mary.
Raped by an angel.
Raped by an angel.
Raped by an angel.
Raped by God.
What exactly are you saying here?
Where were you when l was on my own?
Where were you
when they rolled the stone?
Where were you
when l was getting old?
Where were you
when l was sick and bald?
Where? Where?
Where were you?
Where? Where?
- Where were you?
- Jesus wasn't there. He didn't care.
Where were you
when the children cried?
Where were you
when the children died?
Where were you when l was crucified?
Where were you
when they pierced my side?
Where?

Where? Where?

Doesn't know. Didn't show.
Never there. Doesn't care!
Where were you when he got fleas?
Where were you when he lost his keys?
Where were you

Where were you when the condom split?
- Is it me?
- When the condom split.
- Somebody help me out here.
- When the condom split.
You really gotta help me out.
l don't know what to do.
We're tired of laughing
and we're tired of crying.
We're tired of failing.
- We're tired of all this trying.
- l don't know what to do.
We wanna do some living
cos we've done enough dying.
So come on. Jerry Springer.

- l don't have any cards.
Cards.
Just read the fucking cards.
Just read the fucking cards.
- l don't have any more cards!
- Well. neither do l.
l can't get you your apologies.
This isn't fair. It's a set-up!
There's no way of solving this.
short of a miracle.
Behold God!
We are beholding him.
Behold God!
We are beholding him.
- Then. behold him more!
- What?
- Behold him more!
- God?
Oh. thank God.
Thank God. you're here.

then turning round and blaming me.

Billions of voices

of guests. What are you doing here?
What do you want?
Sit in heaven beside me.
Hold my hand and guide me.
Cos it ain't easy being me.
ln fact. it's diflicult.
Sit in heaven beside you.

Well. that's a no-brainer!
l'm your man. And. Satan.
You can take that barbed wire
and stick it up your own ass.
Back into your sky.

Wait! Wait!
At least give me one chance
to sort this out.
l have a dream.
l have a dream where eveyone here
turns to their neighbour
and shakes them by the hand and says.
''You know.
you're not such a bad guy.''
''Why don't you come on over?
My wife's making meat loaf.''
- Seize the day.
- Burn. Jerry. Burn. Jerry.
Wait. wait! At least give me
a second chance to sort this out.
Four score and seven years ago.
our forefathers brought forth
on this continent
a new nation conceived in liberty.
conceived in freedom
and in...
other abstract concepts.
like smell. l-l...
- Burn. Jerry.
- Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.
At least give me a third chance
to sort this out.
There's just one thing l want to say
to eveyone here today.
Please.
Please don't kill me. Please.
- Seize the day.
- Burn. Jerry. Burn. Jerry.
What the heck! Go ahead and burn me
if it makes you happy. See if l care.
You're never gonna agree
on eveything.
And what's so bad about that?
Satan. you're never gonna get
your apologies.
And. God. you just don't get
a shoulder to cry on.
And. Jesus.
Grow up. for Christ's sake.
and put some fucking clothes on.
Haven't you people
heard of yin and yang.
love and hate.
attraction and repulsion?
lt's the human condition
we're talking about here.
Energy is pure delight.
Nothing is wrong
and nothing is right.
And everything that lives is holy.
And. in conclusion.
fuck you.
Fuck you all!
Eveything that lives
is holy.
Energy
is delight.
We stand together.
joined.
joined in might.
Energy is pure delight.
Nothing is wrong
and nothing is right.
Energy is pure delight.
Nothing is wrong
and nothing is right.
Let poets through the ages tell

Why would l get shot?
Please don't die.
Jerry.
You shot me in the chest.
Why would you shoot me in the chest
after eveything l've achieved?
Please don't die.
Jerry.
Accidentally shot
by a man in a diaper
trying to kill a member of
the Ku Klux Klan.
Not exactly the epitaph
l was hoping for.
Still. it might look good in Latin.
Who will speak for us?
- What do you mean?
- When you are gone.
You've got lots of people out there.
You got Oprah Winfrey.
She's too tame.
Sally Jesse Raphael.
She's too old.
Dr. Phil.
He's too shit.
Ricki Lake.
l guess she's OK.
Now. if you don't mind.
l think l'll ty to get
to a hospital.
Wait. Jerry.
Final thoughts.
Well. firstly.
l'd like to add my name
to the list of celebrities
calling for tighter gun control.
Secondly. it's been a helluva day.
l've learned that there
are no absolutes of good and evil
and that we all live
in a glorious state of flux.
What can l say?
You're not looking
at a dying man here.
You're looking at yourselves
in a matter of months or years
or whatever.
And. for better or for worse.
history defines us by what we do
and what we choose not to do.
Hopefully.
what will survive of us is love.
So. until the next time.
take care of yourselves
and each other.
Ta...

and each other.
