Keep the luggage properly.
Shanti, keep these fruits,

Look after the kids. It gets
pretty cold in koyna.
You are behaving, as if we
are going to simla!
I am nervous, my wife and
kids are going alone for the...
...first time. Mrs Gomes hasn't
come as yet- here they come!!
Julie, come on hurry up.
Only 5 minutes are left.
Hurry up.
My daughter is always after
sweets for the whole day.
Ok, get in now. Hurry.

...come immediately to koyna.
Ok, but where is john.
"John, come soon, bus is

"I thought you won't come, vicky.
- How can that be. I was..."
...iooking for this coat. Wear it.
- And happy birthday to you
i got a fruit cake for you
wow. Thanks a lot.
"Why are you spoiling his habits,
son. When i started giving him..."
...a present he refused & said he
will take it only after eating a...
...cake from his friends hands.
If you do not reach his party...
...he will not celebrate
his birthday in future.
"Why not, he may be anywhere
but my cake will reach him."
Come hurry up. Bye.
Look after my husband i'll
look after him so well that...
...you won't recognise him
on your return.
"Drop vicky, and let's go to the
hotel why?"
"If we don't reach, they will make
mince meat of our friends."
You owe the hotel rs. 400
you can keep my carriage!
What will i do with it. Do i run
the hotel or the carriage?
"Ok, take it from namdev
who is he? Is he the owner?"
"Your servant, sir. Don't insult my
friends, give it to them."
Cut it from namdev's salary
if they don't pay up.
How much is his salary that i
should cut from it?
Why waste time. Give him
your rings.
These three rings has come from
his three wives in dowry
Iook after them.
Why do you wish to mortgage
your rings for such friends.
"You two, i must get my money
by this month end. Ok?"
"This man owes us rs 4 for
liquor, and is not giving."
"Namdev, get the money."
He drinks liquor from a tea cup
and doesn't pay up!
My money is finished. Here is a
rs 5 lottery ticket for 5 lakhs
"take it, my luck is run out.
But you may get it."
"Friends, what do you say? A rs
"...in rs.1 each and buy it? Bring
it, we will buy it."
Whom will the lottery ticket
remain with?
"Anybody can keep it, we a
re all friends."
"No, in money matters there are
no friends or relatives"
let us draw. Whoever is
highest keeps it.
It seems that the ticket
will stay with jagdish.
"Don't run away with it what
are you talking, i will give my..."
...life for my friends let's
shake our hands on it.
"Get up father, it is quite late.
Look, i am leaving the kids at..."
...mother's place and getting the
rations. You reach there.
"Auntie, we have won the lottery."
"We have become rich, my friends
will be happy. I'll ring namdev."
"Raghu, my friend, we have
won the lottery."
Let us embrace friend!
"You had said, you will give your
life for your friends"
"ok, give your life &
i will take the money."
"Police, i am jagdish, just now
my friend namdev has knifed me."
"Jagdish, we have just
won the lottery."
Who has done all this?
"Namdev, what have you done? -
i haven't done anything."
He was already knifed when i
came in. Why are you lying?
For money you have
killed my friend!
I swear by my sons.
I haven't killed him.
Who will believe you. There
is blood on your shirt
"go clean yourself quickly
inside the bathroom, go!!"
See who in inside.
What are you doing? He is
washing blood from his hands.
"Namdev, what are you doing
here? - It is the police!"
Come inside. Why is the
police chasing you?
Jagdish has been murdered.
But i haven't murdered him
"ask raghu, he too was present
there where is raghu?"
I don't know. Maybe he too has
run away on seeing the police.
"Don't worry, i am with you."
"Damu, what has happened
to you?"
They are all dead.
"Can you tell me,
where is namdev."
"Namdev did not come, his wife
and 2 kids had come"
look what has happened!
We are looking for him. He has
murdered and run away.
"No, namdev cannot do this
we will find him."
"It cannot be, namdev cannot do
it. God have mercy on us."
"Here is lottery money, 5 lakhs
what'll you do with the money?"
I will make a hotel i was
also thinking the same
let us make the hotel together.
Namdev will also get peace!
Ok. We will give his son a job
as a barman in the hotel.
Did you get hurt? - No. Now i'm
used to slipping on your marbles
"even her headmaster slipped on
the marbles, she keeps."
"You will never improve. Auntie,
where is johnny? - There he iis"
johnny what is this. You've
become a waiter & left studies?
"This is our family profession.
Grandpa in vithal hotel, father "
"...in irani hotel, and me in this
ram bharose hotel. Come & sit!"
You know dad is sending me to
england. But i told them i am...
...not leaving johnny study
& become a big man.
"When you become big man, i
will feel very happy!"
I had two drinks in name of
jagdish and namdev.
"May god bless their souls!
- You drink to your friends..."
...& we will drink to the
future of this hotel.
You are drinking! - Father has
said you must follow in the...
"...foot steps of your elders.
What do you say, dad?"
Of course son. Live on! You
also teach your son to drink.
"Come on, fill it up."
Congratulations on completion of
I will congratulate after today's
function becomes a success.
Today lots of big people
including film stars are coming.
There should be no complaints.
- We are no less than them.
See our arrangements
tonight!
"Arrangements are super today,
but where is your waiter..."
...with three names who
entertains us all here!
There he is!
"John jhonny janardhan,
here he comes."
"You call, and there i come."
"A friend of friends, and
an enemy of enemies!"
How has he got three names?
"The 3 names are all mine.
Allah, jesus and ram are mine."
So call me by any name! I am
a friend of friends
...an enemy of enemies!
"These film stars, they entertain
everybody, & i entertain them."
"Whether they are english or
indian, i have seen all films."
I too wanted to become a hero.
But fate landed me in a hotel.
"Johny, here is your mawa cake.
With great difficulty i got it."
I will send it for vicky with the
pilot. Go from there.
I hope you are not hurt.
"I told you, no one plays
marbles at this age."
Look i didn't drop the
marbles deliberately.
"No, please go.
I will help myself."
Come off my marbles!
What is happening?
This is what is happening!
A small trouble for you. My
friend vicky is there in uk.
Please give it to him that's
all? If you want we will take u.
"I am not that fortunate. When
this cake reaches, i'll think..."
...i too have reached.
Here's the address.
How can you take so much of
casino winnings. You will have...
"...to play more, vicky. Give
others also a chance."
Your friend johnny has sent
this cake for you.
"My god, i had forgotten my
birthday, by not johnny."
"Captain, this is called friendship,
love and affection"
he will send me a cake
wherever i am.
We have a saying that if you
sweeten your mouth in the
"...morning, the whole day passes
off well. So have a piece!"
"We present this
to you, miss asha."
It seems you have a sore throat.
Should i cancel the programme.
"No, whenever my voice goes bad,
i use cokila drops."
Are you in my fate?
Am i in your fate...
only he knows as he has
written everybody's fate.
"Now put on this bikini, we
have to take a last shot."
"You will look beautiful, and
audience will appreciate."
Do you think i will put on these
clothes? Are u out of your mind.
You promised you will advertise
all our products.
"But not this bikini, which in no
way is our national pride."
"If you don't, we will ensure that
you put on these clothes."
I too will see who will compel
me to put on these clothes.
"You clown, just because you left
india, does it mean that "
...you stop respecting indians!
- Who are you?
"An indian. And you should
know, in india, women "
...iook beautiful not by removing
clothes but by putting them on.
We are doing publicity
for this bikini.
Why don't you put it on? We'll
have publicity as well as fun.
"Save me, call the police."
"Come on monkey, take your
clothes from the tree."
"You have become a hero in front
of her, one day i will make you"
...a villain. I too will dishonor
you. I will show you.
Thank you. One must look after
his country men in foreign land.
And bad times can come to me
also. I am vicky.
"And i am asha yes, there is
hope and you are india's pride."
"What do you do here? - I do
farming, i study in college of..."
...agriculture. What are you
doing this evening?
I have my show today.
- And tomorrow.?
"It is my last day, so i am
going for sight seeing."
May i accompany you
as your guide?
Some other time. Bye.
"May be it is not in fate, that i
spend an evening with you."
How will i repay this debt? - I
am a straight forward man.
Many girls have extended their
hand towards me but i declined.
You are the first woman i am
extending my hand to
say yes or no.
"Look mr. Vicky, we have hardly
met. We are not even friends."
The question of marriage
does not arise.
"Were you doing all this, to
prove to me that he is a hero?"
So you did all this to
impress me?
"All this is a lie, i don't
even know them."
But i know you now this
chap is lying!
Please get off the boat.
Go and enjoy yourself now!
You spoiled my tv program
and we spoiled your romance!
"Yes, that was my move.
You dropped me in the water."
"Sir, please increase my pay
why, i increased your pay by..."
...rs. 10 five years back my
brother is in simla for studies.
Why do you waste your money.
Make him a waiter also.
"No, he will not become a waiter.
He will become so big, that..."
...people will have to look up
to talk to him.
Just increase by one mark
and let me pass.
Catch him and bring him down.
- He has latched the top...
...door from inside.
"If you increase one mark, i will
come down by the stairs. Else..."
...i will jump and come down
think! For one mark he will die.
"If i die, police will come, school
will be disgraced. Then nobody..."
...will send students here. School
will get locked. And if
wait! I am warning you i
am also warning you.
Give him that 1 mark. I have 01
marks. Give him 1 & me 0!
See friends he has ignored moti's
appeal. Now i'll count to 3 &
...then i will dive on you!
"Look, i will dive, hold
me properly."
"Ok, 1, 2, 21/4. 21/2, 23/4
what a wretch you are."
God didn't take so much time to
make world as you are taking.
"Ok, i'll give you one more
opportunity. I am in no hurry."
"Come on girls, come out
quickly girls!"
"Wait, don't go. Don't spoil my
plans. You have"
"sunny, forget all this. Your girl
is stuck in the hostel fire!"
"Don't you feel ashamed hiding
and smoking, you idiot!"
Fire! the whole building is
on fire and you have put on...
"...ear muffs! Something is
wrong with you, you fool"
"you are smoking here, and my
plan has gone hayward!"
"Bring your face here!
Ok, now."
What are you doing? - I'm
taking smoke out of her!
"See, it has come out!"
"Tell her, i have saved her life
by risking my life correct."
"If i hadn't come in time, she
would have become a "kabab"."
"You are so brave, may you
live a 1000 years."
"If one mark is increased, it is
better to live 1 year with..."
...respect than live a 1000
years! - Correct!
It is better to drown in a cup of
water than to face elder brother!
Correct!
It is better to increase one mark
and pass than this! - Correct.
If it is all correct then can't
supreme court appeal to the...
...high court to increase
that one mark.
Supreme court will order the
high court. Pass this deserving...
...boy immediately
but listen to me.
"No, when i say it, pass him.
- Ok, pass!"
"Madam, please allow us to play
kabaddi match with the girls."
"Wait, between boys and girls?
No, it is not possible. No."
Don't get annoyed reading
my love letter.
Till when will this moon torment
one in love with you.
The weather is so beautiful.
"It is spring all over, but"
"then why shouldn't we meet, do
you agree? - I've no objection."
Then at 7:30 should we meet
at milan cinema?
"Meeting will be there, but before
that come with sunny and me."
This youth is so romantic.
I am coming.
What are you doing here?
- Keeping guard! What a good...
"...suit, & your hair so black.
Where is the lightning falling!"
Who are you to ask? Cigarette!
Throw it away. You know...
...going out after 4 is
not allowed.
This rule is applicable to us
as well as you.
I am just checking checking
that all are decked up!
"Singing song, with perfume and
hair blackened. Are you trying..."
...to win madam? You are
being very naughty.
"Speak slowly, somebody
will listen."
"Then give us permission to play
kabaddi, or else, all will know!"
You are my son. You will not
expose me. You want permission?
It is given! -
i too have given.
"Catch & see they don't escape. If
they do, see that they dont return."
"Catch her leg, make her lame.
Hold her arm, then twist it."
"She is your enemy,
not your lover."
"See girls, don't let him escape.
He has to be caught!"
"Catch and don't let them escape.
If they do, let them not return!"
"Look at this one. Come,
handle her carefully."
Be careful her slim waist
doesn't get a sprain.
Catch & don't let them escape!
I will not leave anyone!
"What mischief is all this? -
simple! It means, sweety will..."
...be singing in our hotel from
now-who are you to stop me?
The proprietor's son! - Father
folds his hands for me to work
"...and the son breaks them! - But
for u, i've something else, acid!"
The bird is caught in the net!
- Leave my hand. Leave me.
somebody sees they'll spit at u.
"Just put on these bangles, it
will be a balanced match."
First put on these bangles.
"I said, put on these bangles,
and don't move your hands."
Where are you going?
Won't you sing?
Now all four of you
sing a chorus.
Thank you very much.
This i knew.
You will thank me & i'll say
it was my duty. You will ask...
...my name & i'll say that i'm
john jani janardhan. You'll ask...
my address & i'll say i stay in a
but you
please let me speak.
In all pictures it happens like
this. Villain troubles the heroine...
...with his goons. Hero comes &
beats the villian. Then hero &...
"...heroine become friends, then
marriage, then nonsense."
Nothing like this will happen
here. I am going. Bye.
Will you open this shutter?
"I hope, you had not hired these
goons to prove, u are a hero?"
"What is your name? Anyway, if
it was a film, it could be! This..."
...is reality. If i hadn't come you
would have by this time bye.
"We present to you, india's
famous singer, miss asha."
"Are you in my fate, or not.
Am i in your fate, or not."
Who knows except one who has
written everybody's fate.
"You? - Yes, i had told you i
stay in a 5 star hotel and feed..."
...the hungry. That gentleman
there has invited you for dinner.
One day in my dreams
he met me.
"Looking at me,
he lost his soul."
I got scared...
and i blushed.
When he came close to
me and said...
"are you in my fate, or not.
Am i in your fate, or not."
And then we met again...
on one romantic night.
"We talked the same thing as to
how are we feeling, and i said..."
you only tell me... and
he also said...
"are you in my fate,
or am i in yours..."
...only one who has written
our fate knows.
"Am i in your fate, or not.
Are you in my fate, or not..."
don't call me here by snapping
your fingers like u did in hotel.
Here you will have to call me
with love & respect.
Should i drop you home?
- You will drop me home?
I thought the story ended in the
hotel. It appears something else...
you finished your meal fast.
- I didn't have my meal.
"That's a very good thing, you
did. The food is as bad as the..."
"...villains. If you had eaten,
your sweet voice would've gone."
"I didn't call you to talk crap.
- Ok, i will keep quiet."
Where do you want to go? - You
told me not to speak & why ask
i want to go to ballard pier.
- You stay there?
"No, someone waits there for me.
- Waits? - yes."
"Who? - My lover. We meet for
an hour, some kisses & it's fun"
"you dropped me at the right
place. Come, i will introduce you."
"I don't want to meet your lover.
- Since you've come, meet him!"
"No thanks, bye! - Just listen!"
My fate appears cock-eyed!
My friend has come.
It is my fate that i have to
kiss this guy!
"Yes, that too the face
you have to smash."
Today's fight is not easy.
Just look at the guy?
Look i have sold everything and
brought rs 5000. tell me how...
...much should i put on you
as much as you want.
Should i put 1 for 5?
Ok.
Here. I am putting 1 for 5. ok?
I am putting 5000. fight well.
"Mehboob, my mood is gone
what! If you lose, i lose rs 5000"
why didn't she come? - Forget
all that and fight.
"Go, my dear fight or else i will
get a heart attack. Go."
"Good you came, i was not
getting in the mood to fight."
"Hey, wait. I am talking to a girl."
"Just wait, i am returning."
"Wait, don't go, ok?"
"Well done johnny,
you fought well."
"It is good you came, otherwise i
was in no mood to fight."
I have to make an extra buck
for my younger brothers fees.
"For your own blood, you have
to shed some blood."
How did you return? - I thought
i will meet your lover is it?
"Ok, i will show you my hero,
you smashed him. You are great."
Can't you see a girl is standing
here. He is my sweet heart!
So this is your lover?
Why are you laughing? - What a
lover you have found?
"Suppose there was a beautiful
girl like you, then?"
I would have smashed her into
pieces look ahead!
There is some burning smell
why should i be jealous?
"If you are, tell me. Unless there
is something, one is not jealous."
"Say it, if you are jealous i am
the happiest guy on earth!"
"Ok, it starts today what are
you doing, i will hit you."
"Hit me, i am used to it. If you
hit me, i will die happily."
"One day, i have to land
in a coffin."
What will it be worth? -
atleast 1.5 million.
"No, it is 2 million. And on
reaching the market, 2.5 million."
"Let it get organised, we will
earn in billions, isn't it, damu."
"This is the last. After this, no
opium & poppy will be grown..."
...on my farm why? -
my son is coming back.
"That is the reason, i can't do
business with you."
"Sons should be like mine, who
follow their father. Your son..."
"look, i have said it! I want the
whole place cleared by tomorrow"
"damu, in our business, there is
no father, no mother, brother..."
...only money. Take care of your
son. Or we will take care of him
that will not be necessary. I
will take care of it.
How did this happen?
Whoever threatens my son
will meet this fate
"for a sore throat, take strepsil."
Did it make a difference?
"Your medicine is great, else my
show would have been cancelled."
"Thank you, you may ask what
ever you want for it."
Really! - Yes- then give your
hand into mine!
What do you think of this hand?
- It is very heavy.
"What are you doing, we are
doing shooting for a medicine."
But he held your hand how
dare he ask for your hand!
Why haven't you asked for my
hand till today?
That is what i have
come here for.
"Listen, i don't have money but a
treasure house in my heart."
"I will make you a queen. I give
food on the table to people..."
"...but i will place you in my
heart, and serve you forever"
"every one is around yes, let
them all know. Let me kiss you."
"Yes, yes and yes not like
this. Smile and say it."
Come tomorrow and meet mother.
"I forgot, my friend is coming
from london. Drop me on your..."
...motor cycle- let me change!
Father.
This smell of liqour?
I drink sometimes when i am
unhappy but abroad it is normal.
My friend johnny hasn't come.
"Take out your license license?
- Let us go, we are late."
"John, you go. I will park the
bike and come."
"Father, john should be coming."
"John, i thought you will never
come how is that possible!"
"To celebrate our meeting, let
me have a drink."
You have started drinking?
You have made liquor a monster.
I am taking liquor not poison.
"Son, i am getting late wait
father. What do you know..."
"...about friendship! - Vicky, you
are still the same. Its good."
Tonight there is a party at my
place and you are coming
"if you talk like this, then
tonight's party is cancelled, and..."
"...i will smash everything to
pieces - ok, i'll come."
But i have a girl friend bring
her along. Let's see your choice!
"If you had seen her before, you
would have chosen her."
"Enough, vicky. Let us go ok.
Just a second. How is julie?"
"She has grown, & she is
beautiful ok, see you."
You met your friend? - There he
goes. He has called you at his...
...party tonight how can i
come. I have a show.
"Cancel it, my friend has come.
- Not possible."
"I have an agreement of 1 year,
and can't cancel any show."
You honor your contract and i
will honor my friendship.
"Julie, come down fast."
"If for engagement, it is taking so
much time what will happen..."
"...at the time of marriage?
Perhaps, a life time?"
"She is a girl, and girls
take time to dress up."
"My friend has come from london,
and he looks so smart!"
"Ok, but get julie. Rodrigues
is waiting last two hours."
It is a question of marriage. She
must be feeling shy. I'll get her.
"Rodrigues, you know this? -
what is this? - Marbles!"
"Yes, i played in childhood
good, you will have to play..."
...even after marriage!
"You are here. Come, there is a
boy to meet you. Come."
You are crying? - I don't
want to marry him.
Don't marry him.
But why do you cry?
"Do you love somebody else?
- Yes, our friend vicky."
When did you start loving him?
- Since i was small.
"You are telling now! If you had
told me earlier, i would have..."
...got you married to him and
sent you to london.
"Now i understand, why my friend
keeps asking about you. How is..."
"...she, does she look beautiful?
Will she come to my party?"
"He has called me to a party? -
yes, and i will talk to him..."
...about your wedding also.
- Truly? - yes!
"Mr damodar, he can get cirrosis
of the liver. If he doesn't stop..."
"...drinking, results can be
very damaging."
Have you heard what
the doctor said?
"Doctors say anything. Life brings
birth and death, then how does"
...liquor come in between? - So
you will not give up drinking!
"No, unless... no ok, drink as
much as you want."
"Till you give up drinking, i will
not return to this house."
How is he?
"At present he is ok, but if
he carries on like this, the..."
...end won't be good. He is your
friend. Try to convince him.
"Julie, you stay here."
"If you have come to lecture
me, then just shut up."
"No, i have come to reason with
you. What is it that is troubling"
...you that you drink so much
love! It makes you cry or drink.
In london i met a girl. You also
have a look at her.
"If you had met her before me,
you would have chosen her."
"If she returns to your life, will
you give up drinking?"
"Why give up drinking, i will
give up my life."
"No friend, just give up
drinking liquor."
"If required, i will give
up my life."
"Forget it, this girl is not going
to return to my life."
And if she returns? - Then i
will give u whatever you ask for
"before time, and after fate,
if there is anything..."
"...left, you may give it to me."
"Is that julie? My god, how much
has she grown. Why don't you...!"
"...come inside? - No, it is better
for me to stay outside now."
For so long i am asking where
is julie. And you are crying!
"Don't worry, i am alright.
Doctors talk nonsense. I will..."
...be alright. First i will find a
good boy for you.
"Then with great pomp and show,
we will get you married."
Life takes tests.
It takes people's lives.
"Life takes tests,
it takes loved one's lives."
"Friendship takes tests,
it takes friends' lives."
Life takes tests.
"Who will inform the uninformed,
that this love will make me mad."
Life takes tests.
It takes lover's lives.
What happened? -
the same old pain.
Walk carefully in the path of
love. Think and then love.
"Love takes tests,
it takes lovers' lives."
Friendship takes tests.
"Our fate is bad, this i came
to learn from liquor."
"Drinking takes tests,
it takes the drinkers' lives."
Life takes tests.
What has happened to her? -
maybe she is facing a test.
"John is only coming for a meal,
you cry as if he is marrying!"
"I am not crying, i am
just cutting onions!"
Cooking is beyond you. You
should only sing. What a boy
"...you have chosen. What a
pair, you will make."
"Just go and see, maybe he has
come straight away!"
A letter has only come and the
fiancee hasn't come.
"Did you call me? - Yes, come
in and see."
What is there in her which i
don't have? Kill me but i will...
...not let you go. You wed me
and now you want to go out?
"Yes, i don't want a bore like
you. Don't interfere."
"You will destroy asha like you
destroyed me, is it?"
She is interested in me and i in
her money! Now i will go.
"You have got your money, now
your game is over asha..."
i have heard everything. Leave
my hand that woman is mad.
"A new girl has come, so i am
mad. You have ruined me."
"I will jump into a well
and take my life go, go."
"Stop her, she is going! - Let
her go and die."
"Julie, are you out of your mind?
- Let me die. I want to die!"
You here? - You?
I came to meet johnny do
you know john?
Yes i know now. People put
on different masks.
"Vicky, what are you doing here?
- That is what i am asking you."
"Julie is jumping in a well,
and she..."
all this is just latching on to
people. Promises made in past...
...are not to be taken so
seriously. Tell what promises.
"Ok, i got engaged. It is not
necessary, i have to marry you!"
You have to marry. This is not
england where everything goes.
In which law book is this
written?
"You loved julie, got engaged to
her and you never told me?"
"What is there to tell, i have
done so fifty times."
This is no ordinary affair. Her
mother brought you up and fed...
"...you and you talk like that? -
ok, i will pay her off!"
"How dare you talk like that. You
don't understand love, friendship?"
"From the time i was born, i've
seen all this nonsense."
"World is selfish. When you want
something, you talk of love..."
"...devotion, and friendship. All
is forgotten thereafter."
That means our friendship also...
- go your way. That's best.
Tell me. What is the value of
our friendship? Tell me.
"I love asha so that she will
earn, and i will live in peace."
Now she has come to know of
me. Doesn't matter. There are...
...plenty of fish in the ocean. I
made friends with you as you...
"...are rich. Thought i will take
lots from you, your house..."
"cheat! All my life, i considered
you as my brother."
You are unfit to be even my
enemy. Go and get lost
you are coming with me?
Walk carefully in the lanes of
love. First think and then love.
Love takes testsit takes lovers
lives. Friendship takes tests.
Seeing your sacrifice even
god is crying.
"In this storm of love, my
friend's life is more precious"
"asha, i hope you don't think that
all was due to me. Or did i "
...set it all up? He is my
childhood friend. Today he was...
...talking such trash. He broke
so many people's hearts.
In love and friendship one
is often fooled.
"One doesn't know whom to love
and befriend, & whom to trust."
Just halt here thank you.
"You are a good man, and a
bottle looks bad in your hands."
You think there is nobody besides
you for johnny. No. Johnny has...
"...now a heart of stone, & it will
not break easily. Like you many "
...will come and go. Even foreign
ones. I am asking finally!
"Look, here i come."
How much will you drink? -
how will i live if i don't.
Give me the bottle! - No i will
not give. It is my medicine.
"Taking this, one doesn't get hurt."
Where are you going?
- That is my brother.
"Get a proper boxer, where have
you got this school boy from?"
"If i don't beat you up, i am not
my father's son. Raise stakes!"
I hope you don't land me into
trouble raise stakes 1 to 10!
"Sonny, what are you doing
inside, come out!"
"Don't touch my brother! -
brother, i will sort him out!"
Get up!
When did you come? -
some time back. Aunty told me...
have you passed? Yes. I have
let us celebrate. Give the bottle.
"No, let us go home straight
no let us celebrate."
What has happened? You are
drinking so much. Don't drink so
"don't lecture me no, i am just
making you understand."
Don't disgrace yourself in front
of these people.
You are abusing me! Who are
you to make me understand?
You are insulting me. I am not
coming with you.
Come my brother!
"Come my brother, i request you,
please come."
"Moon has become a vegabond,
the morning star has come out."
Come my brother!
- You think i am drunk?
"Not you, but i had a drink. Who
ever had it, it is not good."
Enough of befriending the world.
I break my head otherwise.
Enough of this now!
Come my brother...
"forgive me my friends,
i am drunk."
When your elder brother is a
drunkard. What'll the younger do
you decide what is good or bad.
I will leave it to you.
I told you to go away!
Come my brother...
"the cabbie did not let me sit, &
carriage man showed his whip!"
"I will make you sit on my back,
& i will take you. Come brother."
"No, i don't want to go."
Come by brother!
"Being big, you want to bully your
younger brother you won't come.!"
Ok then it is no talk with you.
You are my sweet heart. My
life is for you.
"If you love me, i'll break
this bottle."
"No, no. Come my brother. I
request you. I beg you."
"No, i'll not come."
Come my brother...
now you have come on line.
Come my brother...
come my brother...
"brother, she is my daughter.
- Greetings!"
"Looking at you, i remember
your father."
"He was not a friend, he was
more like a brother. If he was..."
"...alive he would have been very
happy, this friendship is now..."
"...changing into a relationship.
Come daughter, accept this."
But mother
- it is an offering. Accept it.
"Hearing of her marriage, she is
blushing. Please sit down."
So late? - Cat crossed the
path. That why the delay.
"Who is it? - I told you mother,
we are college friends."
Come sit down. It is a lucky day.
Offers have come for both...
"...my daughters
come son, what is your name?"
Sunny i didn't ask you. Your
parents? - They are not there.
My elder brother is there
what does he do?
He has a hotel business.
- What is your brother's name?
"John john janardhan?
Yes, do you know him?"
"Very well, he works as a
waiter in my hotel."
"Lady, full marks to you. You
have a big heart."
You are building a relationship
with your husband's murderer
...where people break
such relations.
What are you saying! -
ask him!
"Aren't you namdev's son?
- Yes, so what!"
Namdev is the same murderer
who killed one of our friends...
...and orphaned these children.
- What?
"Sister, i will go now. Once the
dates are fixed, i'll inform you."
"You have lit the fire, now see
the smoke also."
"I had come to see a girl for my
son, and not smoke."
Get out of here. My daughter
cannot marry you.
Why not? Why should we
dig up old things.
He's awakened old memories.
Ask him to get out from here.
"Why should he go? If he had
some bad qualities, i myself..."
...would have told him to go.
I will not let this happen.
You mean you are ready to marry
your father's murderer's son?
What proof do you have that my
father is a murderer.
Ask the whole world. Go and
see the police records.
Certainly i will go
and check.
Kill him
he has accepted his defeat.
There is no place for the
defeated here.
There is no place also for those
who disobey me.
I gave you a new life. To take
it back is my right.
There is bad news from india.
Our friend kk has died in a...
...helicopter explosion. And
damodar and raghbir are...
...reportedly behind the blast
damodar & raghbir?
"Yes, your old friends damodar
and raghbir."
"My friends, they trapped me in
a false murder case of..."
...iottery ticket theft.
"Namdev, you will go back to
india, and investigate kks death."
How can i go to india? Police is
still searching for me there
"you will not go as namdev, you
will go as don! - I am ready."
You know what you have to
do and say in india?
I have to punish kk's murderers
and inaugurate the...
...new revolving restaurant.
- Good.
How has don come to india
without informing us?
We have never seen his
face yes i too.
Then let us see him today.
"No, you are damu and you are
raghubir. Changing clothes does..."
...not change reality. You were a
cabbie and you a photographer.
"How did you know all this, sir?"
"I know each detail about those, i
do business with. I know all!"
"But sir, what have we done?
- You will get to know all..."
the ride has just started. Those
who puts others in a spin...
...at times get caught in one
themselves which spins?
There are many. Take episode
no. 1. lets forget it. No 2.
Kk's case kk.? - We haven't
murdered kk.
Which murderer accepts that
he has murdered somebody
clever murderers put the
blame on somebody else.
"Really, we haven't murdered
anybody."
We have our whole life to
prove all this.
"Nobody will move from his place.
- Inspector, what is the problem."
We have come to know that the
owner of this house is a big...
...smuggler. Where is he? - We
don't know. We're servants here.
We don't know when they
come and go.
Do you have his photograph?
- There is his photo.
No confusions. This is
rustom seth hotel.
"Get the bill never a bill for
you, mrs. Gomes"
"ok, i have brought a garland
from mahim church. Put it on..."
...namdev's photograph.
"Forgive me, sir."
Give this to your boss and tell
him we are now quits.
"Sir, namdev is alive, he just
gave me this money."
One ticket to versova.
"Mrs gomes, open your eyes.
Come to your senses and let..."
...me know whether my wife and
kids are alive or not.
"Doctor, make her conscious
as early as possible"
"get her to a hospital
no, we will get everything..."
...for you here. Let her
remain here.
"Good news for you, our namdev
is alive no, he is dead."
"No, just now he has
left my hotel."
"Don't tell this to anybody, or
else the police will be after him."
"Whom we think as don, is none
else but our old friend namdev."
We will have to do something.
I will just tell damu.
"Hold it, we had said about
removing damodar."
Here is an opportunity to
finish damodar and his son.
He is right. If damu uncle goes
with namdev how will it be.
My marriage with julie! How did
you print these cards.
If there is a crack in our
relationship it does not mean...
"...our friendship is finished.
Remember, we had promised..."
"...we will marry on the same
day. Friend, i've come to fulfil"
...our promise. Whether you keep
your promise is up to you.
But i cannot get married
this way.
"Remember you said, friendship
takes your test sometimes"
...today it is your test friend.
"Friend, you only remembered
friendship tests."
You forgot friendship
takes life sometimes.
"Look, julie is there."
"Where is vicky? - There, next
to the phone."
Looks you will have to get
married alone
julie is suddenly missing. I
have searched the whole city.
"A bride is not searched in the
city, but in the marriage hall."
She is upstairs getting ready.
- Julie is here?
"Yes, if you don't bellieve me, go
and see with your own eyes."
"Contact my advocate, mr
venkateshwar"
"julie, what are you doing in
a bridal dress."
"Julie, how can we get married.
You know we had just acted..."
...to convince asha and
vicky. I lost friendship and...
"...sacrificed my love, now let us
go. This place is not for us."
This assembly and this place is
not for us you? And here?
"Yes, you sacrificed your love to
save a friend. Isn't it?"
There to save a brother-sister
relationship julie has what?
Come with me.
What happened? - She was
attempting suicide. If i hadn't...
"...reached, god knows what
would have happened."
"You rascals, you just
increased my price!"
"A girl loved me since childhood,
and i played with her life!"
"And you my friend, you were
ready to sacrifice your love..."
...& life for me! Don't love me
so much that my heart bursts.
Death can never take away my
friend. It doesn't know that...
"...without taking johnny life, it
cannot even look at you."
"With friends like you, death is
only for his enemies."
"With this girls love, i consider i
have found heaven. Come."
"And your love, i place in
your hands."
"Vicky, you have arranged
everything. Now i too should..."
...my love don't worry. If my
younger daughter gets married...
...it will only be with you.
- But that day you had said
the father of a man who did so
much for his friend can never...
...be a murderer. You prepare
for the marriage.
"What is the matter, son. Who is
getting married to whom?"
"I am getting married not to
asha, but to julie."
With julie?
- You think marriage is a joke?
You will get married to asha.
"Father, listen to me, try &
understand."
Raghu's son!
There he is!
There!
Take them inside
and tie them up
"halt, who are you?"
Why have you brought
my friend here.
It is a personal matter.
My friend's personal matters are
my personal matters.
So you will take him
from here.
"If i don't take him,
i am not my fathers son."
"Take care of your youth,
and return."
I am explaining because
i am like your father.
"And i say the same. Take care
of your age, and give my friend."
"I am explaining, because i am
like your son."
No!
God gave me consciousness at
the right time. Otherwise you...
...would have killed your own
son what are you saying!
"He is your elder son, johnny."
Damodar and raghu thought i'm
dead & threw me into a river.
"A man named don saved me, and
took me abroad. There i came to"
...know my family was finished
in the koyna earthquake.
"Then don sent me here to india,
for some urgent work."
"Now unless i find out the actual
killers of kk, i will not return."
"If that is so, then damu's son
will not go unless his father..."
...acknowledges his crime and
your innocence is proved.
"Why? Are you surprised to see
me alive? I am not namdev..."
...who'll die easily. I am damu.
Damu! I will see you are hanged.
Your thinking is wrong. He
wanted to kill namdev's sons.
"No, i don't believe it. I will ring
up the police and tell them you..."
...murdered jaggi and namdev
come off the high horse
"if i get caught, you will
also get implicated."
"No, for i have proof. You don't
believe it? See!"
When you committed the murder i
took the photographs
"i knew, one day you will cheat
me. And these photos will help."
"Raghu, i wil not leave you!"
What have you done. He has
the photo in his hands.
Your father is innocent. He did
not murder jaggi. Raghu did it.
See he is talking. Hurry and
get the photos.
The proof of your father's
innocence is in the pouch.
"Get down. I say, get down."
Taking away proof of your
father's innocence? Come up.
We sent him down. We will
now take you up.
Here is namdev's son!
What did damodar give you
before he died.
Your death warrant! - What
nonsense are you talking.
You haven't given up your old
habit of shouting?
"Talk properly, you fool"
thank god i am not using my
hands. If i had come to know...
"...of your crime, instead of damu,
you would have been there!"
Hand over the photos
hurry up!
These now i'll hand
over to the police.
Really!
"Let the proof burn.
This proof is burnt, daddy."
Should we finish him now?
"Raghu, this is namdev speaking.
- Dying people should be silent."
I am saying that it is time now
for you & your sons to die.
"Namdev this is your mistake.
- Dad, save me."
Now go to the police station
and give your confession.
"Not so soon,
atleast talk to your son."
"Father, don't worry about me. Go
immediately to the police station."
You heard your son's voice. Now
return my son or i will give him
...the same treatment i gave to
damu to damu?
"I have sent him to his friend
jaggi. If you want your son..."
...get my son to the revolving
restaurant at sharp 2 oclock.
Take your son
and give me mine.
You thought by exchanging sons
you will be saved.
"When police get to know you are
namdev, then what will happen."
What will happen when they
come to know that you are...
"...jagdish's actual murderer,
what then?"
Who has the proof?
Proof is here.
"If anyone tries to move, his
death is behind him."
Who are you? -
don.
I am actual don. Stop fighting
amongst yourself. First complete
"...the job, i have come here for."
"Namdev, you come along with
me. Look after them."
After today's inauguration you
will have to go to hong kong.
Hong kong police had come to
arrest don here.
"But you are don i am don for
you, but to police u are the don."
"So in hong kong, you surrender,
& very soon, i'll get you freed."
Then i will hand over your proof
of innocence also to you.
I will hand over your proof
if i refuse then? - You won't.
Here i will tear your proof to...
...shreds and your sons will be
torn to pieces outside.
"Here, each one of you put
on these rings."
Why have you given these
rings to us?
"They have jesus, allah and om
on them. It has the divinity."
Now you all go home.
- But we can't allow...
i am ordering you go
from here.
And ring me up when
you reach home.
"Raghu, you come here.
Let the three go."
"Raghubir, my friend's father
ordered and i'm going."
But to take revenge for my
father's death i will come later.
"Remember raghu, don't ever kill
your enemy in your house."
Kill him in his own house.
Nobody will suspect then.
"When namdev's children ring up
their father, my son will..."
...finish all of them.
There they go!
It looks they can't hear us.
Let us go.
"You have reached safely? - Yes
father, but don't worry."
"Father, why didn't you come with
us? - I will tell at the right time"
"but till i come, remain together
and look after each other."
Why? I hope everything
is alright.
The same will happen to you
you! - Who is he?
"I am don's son, and your death.
Mr vicky, because of you i lost..."
...my london casino license.
Today i have the opportunity...
...to take revenge. Come!
Halt. Dad will be very happy
listening to news of your death.
Kneel down. Haven't you heard?
Get on to your knees.
Any last wish!
Even if there was who would
have fulfilled it?
"Mother, mother!"
"Julie, don't cry. We will take
revenge for your mother's death."
Your dad is waiting. Tell him you
have finished us all three.
On your knees!
"Dad, i have finished all three.
- Well done."
Your dad's life is in danger.
Save him. I also heard they...
...will take him to hong kong
after inauguration.
"Besides saving him, we have to
get the proof of his innocence."
How will we go there? - Tonight
our group has a program there
"ok, let the program be yours,
but troupe will be ours."
We will leave an imprint of
color and intrigue here.
We will put everybody
in a spin here.
"Who will understand our moves,
who is a player like us."
We will play a game and
people will watch the fun.
People will clap and go.
We will leave an imprint here.
"See if you can engage with eyes,
see if you can touch us!"
Try and come in front of us.
We will make heroes to zeroes.
"You may think we are loafers,
you may think we are jokers."
"We are the servants of theatre,
we will raise the curtains!"
And we will also drop
the curtains.
We will put every one in a spin.
"Dad, namdev's sons have run
away run away!"
But you had said and what
has happened to your face?
This is the punishment of jesus.
This is the retribution of allah.
And the vengeance of om.
"Son, the proof of my innocence
is in his pocket."
"Don't worry, those photos have
been taken by the girls."
Come.
Father.
"Father, i hope
you are not hurt"
"come, lets go,
the doors are closed."
That way!
We wil throw the
wire from here.
They don't have the pulleys.
"Om, allah, and jesus are with
you. Make pulleys out of rings."
Take out your rings.
Come fast! -
pull.
Take this also.
"Go carefully, father."
Somebody is coming
from the back.
"I told you, i don't have the
money. Where'll i give it from?"
"If you don't have the money,
why drink and eat?"
I have this 5 lakh lottery ticket.
Take it or leave it.
What happened john? - This
man is not giving money. He...
"listen, some 20 years back you
had eaten food in azad hotel, "
"...not having money, you sold
your lottery ticket, isn't it?"
"Yes. I had soldthat ticketwas
bought by us. Son, bring it here."
Here is your ticket. Never
sell your fate.
"Uncle, what happened?"
"Look sons, when this man comes.
Let him eat & drink in the house."
"In this naseeb hotel, everyone's
is allowed here."
Dance is free?
- Yes!
