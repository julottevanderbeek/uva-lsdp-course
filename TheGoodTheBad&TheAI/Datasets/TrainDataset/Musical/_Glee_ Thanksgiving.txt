I'm sitting in
a railway station
Got a ticket
for my destination
Oh... oh...
On a tour
of one-night stands
My suitcase and guitar
in hand
BOTH:  And every stop
is neatly planned
For a poet
and a one-man band
This wave...
Wave...
Is stringing us along
Along
Just know you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna make
this place your home
Every day's
an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines
Oh, oh-oh
And each town looks
the same to me
The movies and the factories
And every stranger's face
I see
Reminds me that I long to be
The trouble,
it might drag you down
If you get lost,
you can always be found
Just know you're not alone
Know you're not alone
'Cause I'm gonna make
this place your home
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Know you're not alone
Where my music's playing
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh,
oh-oh-oh
I'm gonna make,
I'm gonna make
Make this place our home
Ah... ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah...
Know you're not alone
Ah... ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah,
ah-ah.
Home for the holidays...
just like we promised.
Guys, I-I...
Dude, if you start crying,
I'm gonna kick your ass.
Group hug!
MARLEY:
Don't blow it.
PUCK: So I said, "You girls are
gonna need another cup."
Yeah, but, guys, I'd like
to propose a toast:
To almost all of us keeping
our promise
to come home for Thanksgiving.
Cheers!
Cheers!
Here's to us.
Has anybody heard
from Rachel or Kurt?
No. I know Blaine's been
texting him, but
Kurt won't text back.
Well, Rachel e-mailed me.
She said she's not really sure
what she's doing
for the holidays yet.
I'm sorry about what went down
with the two of you.
No, it's cool.
It's for the best.
Well, I think that it's sweet
that you and Rachel
keep in touch, Quinn.
Well, she basically e-mails me
every other week
to remind me that I still
haven't used
the train ticket
that she gave me.
I'm just, I'm trying
to keep straight A's.
And I just got tapped to be in
the only female secret society
at Yale.
Former members: Hillary Clinton,
Jennifer Beals.
You go, girl.
Well, I, for one, would love
to talk about everybody
that  here.
I have a favor to ask.
All right, do you realize,
standing before you are legends?
Any single one of these guys
could be.
President of the United States
one day.
I don't know about that.
And lucky for us,
they've agreed to help us...
Hang with the new chumps
and see if some of
our sheer awesomeness
doesn't rub off on you.
It will.
When you hear your name,
pair up.
Puck, you're with your brother.
Mike, you're with Ryder.
Marley, you're with Santana.
Kitty, you're with Quinn.
Oh!
Wade, Mercedes.
Sashay.
I knew it.
Mercedes was cloned.
Now, your mentors are here to
help you with whatever you need:
Singing, dancing...
Birth control.
You're so funny and
self-deprecating!
We're so much alike!
Wanky.
The worst mistake
that we can make
is to underestimate
our competition.
The Warblers are ruthless
this year.
Don't forget about
the Rosedale Mennonites.
Any show choir that can
raise a barn in five minutes
deserves mad respect.
Marley and Blaine will handle
our duet,
and for the showstopper
we're doing "Gangnam Style."
Okay, lumps,
let me just say out loud
what everyone here is thinking:
You finally got an okay haircut,
you're not doing
that annoying half smirk
as much as you used to,
but you're still a idiot.
No one in this room
can tackle a massive dance
number except for Brit.
That includes your little
"Hand-Jive"
that, to me, looked more
like a hand...
Is there any way Mr. Shue
can come back for this?
Listen to me, we have never lost
sectionals before,
and there's no way we're
gonna do it under my watch.
We can and we will succeed!
We need an ambitious number
with a strong dance element.
That's the Warbler's calling
card, and we need to blow them
out of the water. And Mike said
he could easily show
one of our guys how to do
the dance number. I did?
Crap. I, uh, I kind of forgot
to ask you about that.
But one of our guys
is gonna have
to take the lead with Brit.
So who's it gonna be?
Hello? White Chocolate.
MERCEDES:
Oh, no, no, no. Um...
Hey, I can't believe
that we have to dance
for this guy who's
getting trained
at the Joffrey Ballet School.
He's gonna think
I'm special needs.
Listen, man, I need to talk
to you about something else.
Last Friday...
I kind of went out with Marley.
Kind of?
I mean, we didn't
actually go anywhere.
We just kind of hung out
and played SongPop
and Bad Piggies all night.
So this is like a thing?
Not if it's gonna make us
mortal enemies again.
I'll end it if you want me to,
but for the record,
I wasn't just gonna
hump her and dump her.
Marley's different,
she's special.
No, don't break it off
because of me.
Yeah?
Yeah, but you better not snake
the dance lead from me,
all right?
You don't get to have
everything at this school.
That's all yours, dude.
I don't have any end
zone moves anyway.
RACHEL: So I found out that I
didn't get cast in
KURT: Oh! But the NYADA
Showcase is this week,
so I'm gonna spend the whole,
long holiday weekend
just really prepping for it to
make sure that I get it. Good.
Did you put in
your application?
Yes, and I put it on Vogue.com
stationery so it'd stand out.
I'm really feeling good
about us staying home
for the weekend, don't you?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah-yeah-
yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah.
We don't have to go home
just because there's a show
or because it's
a long weekend, right?
Right, no.
I mean,
even though it's Thanksgiving,
and sectionals, and
all our friends are there,
and I miss my dad.
I miss my dads, too,
but I just feel like every time
we go home,
it just makes me feel sad
and like we're not like
moving forward, you know?
And even though we don't have
our boyfriends,
we still have our dreams
and our ambition.
And each other.
Yes. You are the only
significant other I need
in my life.
Oh...
I have to just, you know,
forget about Finn
and forget about Brody.
Forget about Blaine.
Yeah, forget any guy who's broke
an girl or guy's heart, okay?
We are on the verge of becoming
the best versions of ourselves.
Can't you feel it?
For the first time,
probably because
it's easier just
to drink your Kool-Aid,
than go against you.
I know what you mean.
Look. Look at our life.
Look at this city!
Yeah.
I know that it can be a little
sad and lonely sometimes,
but I promise you,
we are gonna have the
best Thanksgiving ever.
Pinkie promise?
Pinky promise.
Okay, fellas,
Korean boy bands have
been tearing up the music scene,
and there's a lot
we can learn from them.
Follow my lead.
Fantastic, baby, dance
I wanna dance, dance,
dance, dance
Stretch it out.
Fantastic, baby, dance
Sam, toes, bro!
Dude, wear some shoes!
Jake, come on.
Let's pick it up, man.
Come on, you guys
gotta feel it.
Here we go.
Hands, hip, quick feet.
Easy, Sam. You look like you're
trying to mount someone.
This was what I call
"The Big Tipper."
Big bills always came flying.
Ryder, looking good, man.
Those moves are legit, son.
Seriously, Jake?
Even I can do
better. Come on.
Dude, lay off, okay?
This isn't my style.
Show some more.
Here we go.
Whoo!
Oh, this battle is over.
Looks like we got our new
Gangnam front man right here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, gotcha,
gotcha, gotcha
Wow, fantastic, baby.
Along with being beautiful,
the three of us
are National Showchoir
Championship goddesses.
We are winners.
Which is why Finn has asked
us to come and shower you
with the inspiration
that is the Unholy Trinity.
Santana, Brittany and I
knew each other so well
that I could tell by
the slightest quiver
in Santana's upper lip which way
we were gonna move.
Whether our hips
are gonna shake or shimmy.
No. You girls have to be
tight up there, okay?
The judges love the
feminine quality,
and the Warblers
just don't have it.
It's about being individuals.
You know, we're all different.
But it's also about
synchronicity.
Can you give us an example?
It's been a few months,
but I'm the three of us could
put together something
on the fly.
Yeah!
I've been cryin'
'Cause I'm lonely
Smiles have all turned
The tears won't wash away
The fears
That you're never,
ever gonna return
To ease the fire
that within me burns
It keeps me
Cryin', baby, for you
Keeps me sighin', baby,
for you
So won't you hurry
Come on, boy, see about me
See about your baby
I've given up
my friends just
My friends have gone and you
No peace shall I find
Until you come back
And be mine
No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyway
Keep on cryin', baby,
for you
I'm gonna keep sighin',
baby, for you
So come on, hurry
Come on and see about me
See about your baby
You know I'm so lonely
I love you only
See about me
See about your baby
You know I'm so lonely
I love you only
Come see about me
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Hey, are you...
are you feeling okay?
You look like you're gonna hurl.
Um, I think
I'm just really tired
from all the rehearsing.
KITTY: Now that we're alone,
can I tell you a secret?
Of course.
If Finn
hadn't paired us together,
I would've thrown such a hissy.
Why is that?
Because you're Quinn Fabray,
and I idolize you.
You're Cheerios royalty.
Can I show you something?
Sure.
Every day, I ask myself,
"What would Quinn Fabray do?"
It's really nice to know
that people still remember me.
Remember you?
Oh, no, we aspire to
be you, me especially.
What's with Marley?
She seemed a little out of it
during rehearsal.
Oh, that one?
She's sweet as pie,
and I've tried to be
a good friend to her,
but ever since she started
dating Jake Puckerman,
I fear she's on the wrong path.
Word is he's pressuring her
to swipe her V-card.
If that were to happen,
well, no one knows the
dangers of a good girl
mixing with a Puckerman
better than you.
I can't believe that you're
not dancing with Brittany.
I've seen you.
You're incredible.
You told me that you love it.
You take lessons.
It's kind of an honor amongst
bro thing with Ryder.
Look, he's being really cool
about you and me,
and he wants the solo,
so I'm just trying
to do him a solid.
Even if that means
we lose sectionals?
Ryder's gonna be great.
I promise.
I will make sure he's great.
Now can I walk you
to lunch please?
You've been skipping out
on me all week.
Can't. I have to rehearse.
Because I'm not gonna be the one
who lets the team down.
Uh, guys, listen up.
Ms. July said that
she does not want to teach today
because she can't stand
to be in the same room
as your mediocrity again.
If you ask me,
she just sounds super hung over.
Either way, I will be
teaching Dance 101 today.
Is there a problem?
Well, you know, everyone here
pays like, $30,000 a year
to be taught by a professional
and not a T.A.
I'm sorry, are you angry at me
about something?
You mean, besides the fact
that you slept with Cassie?
And why do you care
who I sleep with?
Do I really need to answer that?
Hey, I'm the one
who came on to you,
remember? You broke
off our date
to see another guy.
Yeah, well, that's over now.
And what, so I'm supposed
to have retroactively known
that that was gonna happen
and not slept with Cassie?
All right, guys,
let's, uh, let's pair up and
start with a basic fox-trot.
We're not in high
school anymore, okay?
We're adults
making adult choices.
You made yourself unavailable.
Don't be that crazy girl
who expects people
to read her mind.
Well, I'm sorry, but you don't
have to be a mind reader to know
that she is my mortal enemy.
Did it at least suck?
Are you kidding?
It was amazing. Have
you seen her ass?
Look, but I know
that we're friends
and I don't want
to hurt you, so...
it won't happen again, okay?
Okay.
What are you doing
for Thanksgiving?
Going back to Ohio?
No, Kurt and I are doing
our little private
orphan Thanksgiving here.
Wow, that sounds awful
and depressing,
especially since I've tasted
your cooking.
All right, guys, come on.
Let's take it from the top.
And this time,
can we actually try?
So I can't afford
to go home this year.
How about I come over
and cook for you guys?
Yeah, that would be great.
Do you mind if I bring Cassie?
Oh, shut up.
Just dance with me.
Okay.
PUCK: That's a real solid you're
doing for that Ryder dude.
"Bros before hos" was always
my mantra in high school.
Well, it was after I knocked up
my best friend's girlfriend.
Oh, speak of the devil
I knocked up.
Back off of Marley.
Excuse me?
I got this, little bro.
See that furrowed brow,
lips pursed,
hand on her hip,
this is what I like
to call "Loopy Quinn."
It's an irrational state
that she apparently only
reserves for Puckermans.
He's messing with her head.
He's pressuring her
to have sex th him.
Who told you that?
I don't need somebody to tell me
that the biggest womanizer
in school
is trying to take advantage
of the naive girl
who just wants to
fit in and be loved,
especially if the womanizer's
last name is Puckerman.
You don't know me.
I'm a lot of thing he's not,
and I would never do that
to Marley.
I don't believe you.
Quinn, I think you're being
a little out of line here.
The only way
you're gonna win sectionals
is if Marley's at her best.
And if you keep distracting her,
she's not going to be.
Hey.
Oh!
Oh, Isabelle, I am so sorry.
I thought I was
the last one here.
Its okay. Actually,
I'm almost done.
I'm just, um, proofing
the filmmaker roundtable.
Oh, I love that article.
Oh, good.
I love Christmas movies.
Be honest, which one
are you looking forward to
the most,
Oh, wow.
I love Peter Jackson,
but I'm obsessed
with the French Revolution,
so, uh, I suppose it would have
to be... a double feature.
A double feature?
So, uh, do you have any
fantabulous Thanksgiving plans?
For the last five years,
I always went to Gore Vidal's
for dinner and Pictionary.
But you know,
Gore passed away this year,
so I don't know.
I'll probably just get
some turkey pizza
from Two Boots and, uh,
recreate my first Thanksgiving
in New York.
Well, if you're interested,
my roommate and I are hosting
a bit of an orphan's dinner
out in Bushwick.
Bushwick? Ooh.
A rustic Thanksgiving.
Can I bring some friends?
Of course.
We'll have as many orphans
as Mr. Bumble's workhouse,
right?
Gruel for everyone.
You seem in a better mood.
You and your ex
have a
No, I'm closing the book
to that sad saga.
I'm just...
I'm done.
I'm done thinking about it.
I'm done thinking if we're
gonna get back together,
wondering if we should
get back together.
No, it's over.
I sent him a text.
Said, "Please, stop calling me
to say you're sorry."
What's done is done."
You know.
Well, listen,
nothing is better than being
single in New York City,
but you know, if he's
been reaching out to you...
Assuage his guilt?
No, sorry, cheater.
This petal needs to move on.
In my experience,
it's always easier
for me to move on
if I've either
had my apology accepted,
or in your case,
accepted an apology.
You know,
sometimes it's the not forgiving
that holds us back.
QUINN:
Try to make eye contact
with the judges,
and don't be afraid
to give them
a flirty little smile
or maybe even a wink.
You're really doing them
a favor.
You're reminding them
of their youth
and what might have been.
I'm gonna write that down.
You're the best mentor ever.
Seriously, the best.
That bitch is pure evil.
I think she's sweet.
Really?
Well, then why is she giving
my girl laxatives?
Why are you going
through my bag?
It's all part
of being a mentor.
What is this, huh?
And don't tell me
it's 'cause the cafeteria food
binds you up.
Those are like, from months ago.
I forgot
they were even in there.
Your pretty little liar
gave them to her.
I can sense it thanks to my
psychic Mexican third eye.
See, this is what my psych
professor calls projecting.
You're projecting Kitty
onto me.
Santana, we've graduated.
It's really time
to get over this.
Get over what?
You being jealous of me.
And why would I
be jealous of you?
And please don't tell me
its because you're in some lame
secret Nazi sorority.
Look, Homecoming weekend,
I went
to Jodie Foster's clambake,
and that professor
that I was talking about,
well, he's 35,
smokes a pipe.
Well, he's divorcing his wife
who hasn't touched him
for three years.
I'm dating him.
Wow, Twitter update!
Quinn is
all excited about another guy
defining her life.
And what are you excited about?
Shaking pom-poms in Kentucky?
I mean, you want everybody to
think that you're such a badass,
but really you're just
a scared little girl
with low self-esteem
who's too frightened
to chase her dreams.
Did Professor Patches
teach you that one
in between quickies
on his office couch?
Does he get so turned on
by teen moms who barely
visit their kid?
What are you guys doing?
Nothing.
Quinn always was
a genius slapper.
Are you dancing
or impersonating
a horny epileptic?
Dude, I can't concentrate
on the moves
until I memorize the words.
I mean, seriously?
Dude, it's Korean.
Just sing gibberish. Who cares?
And if you're concentrating
on the dance moves,
you're doing it wrong.
Well, that's how
I work through everything.
I learn the basics, practice
them over and over again,
and eventually I get it.
So, did you do an apple pie
It's exactly what I did,
but I wore a condom
so I didn't make
any apple fritters.
Look.
Some things you can't
overthink, okay?
You just got to let
it come natural.
"Gangnam Style" isn't
about technique.
It's about just
letting yourself go.
Okay?
Hey, sexy lady Sexy lady...
Wup, wup, wup, wup
Wuppa Gangnam Style Whoa.
I thought you said
you didn't have any moves.
You asked
me not to take everything
from you and I respect that.
Plus, it's kind of embarrassing
that I'm trained in ballet.
Like, seriously?
Like tutu and everything?
It doesn't leave this room.
Dude, you're obviously
better than me.
If we want to win,
you should do it.
How about
I just help you get better?
Okay.
But if at any point
you want to bail,
or get food,
or go get me food...
Let's start by watching
this video one more time.
Maybe we'll be
viewer 500 million.
There he goes.
A bag?
Yeah, I'm telling you, you put it
in the bag and it self-bastes.
Tommy the turkey
is not gonna go dry.
Ina Garten would never cook
a turkey in a bag.
Well, when Ina comes to cook
you Thanksgiving dinner,
she can do as she pleases.
But our bird
is getting bagged.
Mmm.
Guys, this is so great.
Yeah, it's like
our own
Yeah, but no one breaks
out into song. What?
Now, Rachel, get over here
and help me butter up Tommy.
Okay, well, I'm a vegetarian
so I can't eat it but
I guess I can touch it.
Yeah. Okay, Mr. Tur...
I'm very sorry.
Like that?
You got to get it in there.
Really show him
that you love him.
You know?
Just like that.
Is that good?
Yeah, like that.
When you two are done
using that turkey
as a courtship device,
would you put it in the oven?
'Cause it's almost 5:00.
Oh, my God, it's almost time
for sectionals to start.
Why are they having it
on Thanksgiving anyway?
I'm sure they figured
with everyone
home for the holiday,
they would sell more tickets.
Most high schools have football
games for Thanksgiving.
I remember my first sectionals.
I was so nervous.
I gave myself this pep
talk in the mirror,
and I just began my soulful
monologue by saying...
MARLEY:
Wade... I mean,
Unique, you're back!
Yes, in all her glory.
And as you can see, Miss Marley,
she is ready for her close-up.
I thought your parents didn't
want you wearing...
They don't.
They're trying to protect me.
But what they need to understand
is if I'm not being
true to myself at least
when I'm performing,
then there won't be
anything left inside
me to protect.
So they can keep talking
about sending me to a camp
for little boys who
like to wear dresses,
but I will not and I cannot
be ashamed of who I am
or how I look.
You look beautiful.
I think it's inspiring
how brave and proud you are.
I wish I was more like that.
Stop.
Hustle up, you two.
You're gonna miss show circle.
And welcome back, girl.
What's show circle?
Come on.
It's a tradition
before every competition.
It's something Mr. Shue made up.
And today I want to add to it.
Joe, how about
you lead us in prayer?
PUCK:
Whoa, dude, Old Testament.
There's Hebrews here.
Yeah, okay.
This is one of my favorite
Bible verses from Isaiah.
Considering that the
Warblers are so good,
and that it's the first
competition for a lot of you,
I think it's appropriate.
"So do not fear
because I am with you.
"Do not be dismayed.
"I will strengthen you,
I will uphold you
with my righteous hand."
And our righteous dance moves, amen.
All right!
Ugh! Man, I-I remember
our first sectionals
like it was yesterday.
We came together as a
team because we had to.
Because no one
outside our circle
knew how much we'd been through,
and how much
it meant to us to win it.
This is our house.
Look into the faces
of these graduates.
They've been to
the mountaintop.
This is just the first step in
your climb to meet them there.
On three?
ALL:
One, two, three!
A... mazing!
MAN :

KURT:
You okay?
Mm. Yeah. I was having a moment.
You know, every year, over,
like, an assortment of pies,
my dads and I would sing
these holiday medleys
by the piano.
And, I don't know, I'm just
starting to feel like maybe
that part of my life is over.
Oh, sweetie, as long
as we're in each other's lives,
holiday medleys
will never be over.
:
Promise me?
Okay.
How's it going?
Oh, this bird is done. Oh.
Yeah.
All right, Kurt,
do you want to do the honors?
No, thanks. I'm not even
having turkey after
the way you guys manhandled it.
Can I help you?
Isabelle Wright invited us
to an Orphan Party here?
Oh, right. Uh, yeah, apparently,
we're having a party.
Oh. Okay. Welcome.
Come on in.
KURT:
By the way,
have any of you heard
from Isabelle?
I tried calling her earlier,
but I got her voice mail.
She was stopping at some new
club opening next to Pyramid
over in the East Village.
Oh, wait. This is her now.
Uh, hello?
Hey, I'm calling you back.
Ooh, she's been a bitch tonight.
And by bitch, I mean this rain.
No cabs nowhere.
So I had to put on the wig
and the heels and the lashes
and the ear, and take a train
to the club.
So I hope you're up, girl,
'cause we are all coming over.
Lock the door, lower the blinds,
light up the smoke machine,
and put on your heels,
'cause I know
exactly what we need.
Let's have a kiki
I want to have a kiki
Lock the doors tight
Let's have a kiki  Mother
I'm gonna let you have it
Let's have a kiki
I want to have a kiki
Dive, turn, work
Let's have a kiki
We're gonna serve
and work and turn
H-honey
Wait, wait. What's a kiki?
A kiki is a party
For calming all your nerves
We're spilling tea
and dishing just desserts
When they deserve
And though the sun is rising
Few may choose to leave
So shade that lid
and we'll all bid
Adieu to your ennui
Let's have a kiki
I want to have a kiki
Lock the doors tight
Let's have a kiki  Mother
I'm gonna let you have it
Let's have a kiki
I want to have a kiki,
dive, turn, work
Let's have a kiki
We're gonna serve
and work and turn
It's turkey lurkey time
Tom turkey ran away
but he just came home
It's turkey lurkey time
He's really home to stay,
never one to roam
Let's make a wish
And may all your
wishes come true
Turkey lurkey
Goosey loosey
Some for Uncle Joe
Some for Cousin Lucy
Everybody gather
round the table
Dig in,
dinner's being served
Eat all the turkey
you are able
Can't you see a partridge
in a pear tree?
Climb up and bring it
down for me
That's something
I would like to see
This kiki is marvelous
Kiki, Soso, oui oui, non non
Kiki, Soso
Oui oui, non non
Let's have a kiki

Lock the doors tight

Let's have a kiki
I want to have a kiki,
boots, turn, queen
Let's have a kiki
We're gonna serve
and work and turn
Let's have a kiki!
This is the best
Thanksgiving ever!
If I timed this right,
Robin will wake up just as the
New Directions hit the stage.
She's a very fussy baby,
so she'll be wailing through
their entire performance.
Is this seat taken?
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!
Oh, so good to see you.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
You made it, didn't you?
You made it.
America is thrilled.
ANNOUNCER:
They traveled 87 miles
by horse and buggy
to drop an old school beat.
The Rosedale Mennonites!
America
Ah...
Over the river
and through the woods
To Grandmother's house we go
The horse knows the way
to carry the sleigh
Through the white
and drifted snow
Over the river
and through the woods
Trot fast, my dapplgray e
Spring over the ground
like a hunting hound
For this is Thanksgiving Day
She'll be coming round
the mountain when she comes
She'll be coming round
The mountain when she comes
Oh, when she comes
She'll be coming
round the mountain
She'll be coming round
the mountain
She'll be coming round
the mountain when she comes
A...
Mer... i... ca
America!
I love you guys.
Good job.
:
Mr. Shue is here.
What?
What?
Yes.
Hello?
Hey.
Can you hear me?
It's kind of loud out here.
Um, yeah, yeah, I can hear you.
Have you guys performed yet?
Uh, no, not yet.
Kurt, I just want you
to know that
no matter...
Just let me talk for a second.
Look, you've... you've said
you're sorry a million times.
And...
I believe you.
And I'm trying
to forgive you, but...
...I'm just not there yet.
But...
it's Thanksgiving,
and it's sectionals, and...
I miss you like crazy.
And... I can't stand
not talking to you,
even though I'm mad at you.
'Cause you're still
my best friend.
You're mine, too.
At Christmas, we... we need to
have a mature heart-to-heart.
And maybe if it's cold enough,
we can go ice skating
on the Auglaize River,
and get hot chocolate
anywhere but the Lima Bean,
because when I was
working there I saw a mouse.
So, uh, we're really gonna
see each other at Christmas?
Yeah.
Well, don't let any of those
hideous Warblers win.
All right?
Break a leg.
Happy Thanksgiving.
H-happy Thanksgiving.
Kurt, I love you so much.
I love you, too.
You okay?
Yeah.
You don't look okay.
Okay, fine, I'm not okay.
Look, look...
It's just nerves.
It's a good thing.
You can use it.
I don't know how
it's a good thing
when I haven't slept in days,
and I'm sweating
when it's not even hot,
and I feel like
if we don't win,
it's going to be all my fault.
I'm going to let
all you guys down.
Finn, the graduates,
and my mom.
Jake, you got a second?
Not now. Can it wait?
Not really. I need you
to take the dance lead.
I think I sprained
my ankle during warm-ups.
You're not limping.
What's going on?
Look, it was really cool
what you did,
but a few days
of rehearsal and practice
doesn't make me as good as you.
And you don't put in
second-string QB
just to be nice.
Because it's not
nice... the whole team
suffers, and we
to win this.
Just do it, okay?
Yeah.
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage,
the New Directions!
Come on.
You're gonna kill this. Hm.
All right.
Good luck, you guys.
