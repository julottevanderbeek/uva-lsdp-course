They say friendship is greater than
all other relationships
But, friendship between us has been
over shadowed by a strange bond

Girls swoon over him
They always hang around him only
He guides many students to
score centum in exams
ln college's good students list
...he's a Hero
My name is...
Are you Rajesh? l don't like
this proxy attendance
Students must be like fire
in studies
What did you say? Did he ask
about my absence from class?
Does he know what a spear gear means?
...Do you know?
Did he actually complete
his studies?
Ask him to come to me & learn!
...You'll teach, buddy!
Buddy! we must enjoy college life!
Anyway our life will be like
cat on a hot tin roof
We can become serious then!

Hey! What's it man?

What do l suggest for that is...
You're a rowdy outside the campus

Me? Beating you?
–No… No! it won't look good
Come on hit me?

How's that?
...l warned you! but you turned deaf
Buddy! please give me concession
Even, l guided students to

...But, they've to pay me
Rs 100, that's all
Girls are allergic to me
No question paper for you!

Right from first meeting we had
an unimaginable mutual love

into unnecessary matters!
l'm warning you only, Rajesh
Please no...No!
Hey! l'm warning you
Please listen to me
Come on guys clap!

He called us as idiots and
beat me up
lf he's a Mechanical Engineer does
he think himself to be great?
Today, he's finished!
Why did you interfere into
my friend's matter?
Why did you beat him?
–Shall l give you also few punches?
Leave me...Leave me!
Are you here to study or fight?
You may have trouble between
yourselves! keep it off the campus!
...Not inside the college
Shyam! you're a brilliant student
Why do want all this gangs
& brawls?
Look at him, with ear studs
a chain around neck
...A steel bangle on hand
Rajesh! you're very proud on receiving
money whenever you ask from grandpa
lf you concentrate little on studies
you'll be University topper
Leaving it...with 10 people behind you
and 10 people behind you
Combined together you're creating
chaos in the college
Sir, he had only started it
lf l get one more complaint
against you both
l'll expel you from the college
What?
What?
l'm not one to get scared
by Principal's warnings
You don't know about me
Don't play all this foolish
kiddish behaviour with me
lf l decide l can go
to the top also
Oh! Mamma! l'm scared at that thought
l don't know why! basically
l'm a good man only
When l see you and your filthy gang
l lose my head
...Turn into a bad man immediately
why do you think, l'm like that?
What you're becoming now?
you're a born bad man
Hey! you're abusing in English

...l hate him to the core
Am l not telling you?
Buddy! bouquet boy!
He's a man with great luck!

Does he have a lucky mole?
Whatever you may say, he's a
great hit with girls
What happened after that?
What'll happen? l jumped in
and saved him
My friends have got bored
talking with boys
They feel like talking to girls
Can you give company to them?
...Don't do it freely!
l'll pay you Rs 500 each
Who's he? Elder brother?!
ls he Uncle or fiancee to
all of you?
Have you trapped all of you
in one go?
No, Sam!
Did you see? Sister stopped him and

You're a personification
of gentlemanliness
What's lacking in you? A flute?

Hey! get a flute for elder brother

Hey! wastrel! how many papers

Hey! Rajesh! do you've 8 papers

her entire roll!
First you go away from here!
You bloody! did you
observe that also?
Buddy! please introduce me to her!
You?
–Why?
You hate girls, isn't it?
Are you still thinking me

Go..first, you go away from here
Buddy! lf l strangle your neck

Hey! did you talk to her?
Did she talk to you?
Did she make any silent gestures?
Not even that..

You go for another girl!
Buddy! till now, did l ever
talk about any girl?
There were many girls in
our college, isn't it?
Chembaruthi of Chidambaram

look at them
No one ever had disturbed

This girl has upset me totally!
She's a demoness
–No, buddy
...Beautiful face!
...Dot on the forehead!
Tender fingers!
...Buddy!
...Please forgive me!
Why?
As you were describing her beauty
l too enjoyed it!
Then, what man?
You're saying, face, dot, roots!
lt's fingers!
–Okay!
Nothing is matching with
your personality!
Not only this buddy! if l say one more

told already!
Come on tell, buddy! we'll believe
whatever you may say
lf you say, l'm not a man

Hey! isn't it true man?
Don't get angry girl!
Hey! look there!

Hey! shut up! why're you dancing like
possessed one in a Temple?
Better than this, you could've
done another thing! – What?
The banana leaf left by her
after eating food.

here in a frame
lt would look fantastic!
You could become first man to frame a
lover's left out leaf in this world!
No, buddy..that's...
What? No buddy! you were
boasting that day!
...You hate woman and you'll not
waste time chasing women
Looks like you're going to

That's what, l'm unable

–What?
lf that girl refuses you,not just today
your life will become a waste
What shall we do now?
Shall we all have a drinking
binge and sleep?
Good idea buddy!
He's asking an idea for love and you're
suggesting what we do everyday
Let's pack our baggages and

Great man has come!

stuff and talk enthusiastically
Sister-in-law! What do you lack?
You would've eaten a pizza or a burger
and slept peacefully with a doll
Do you know, he has become
a doll with your thoughts?
Don't get worried thinking
about her
My heart says that girl will definitely
fall in love with you
Don't believe him, he's talking all
rubbish for few drinks
He's going overboard? lf l get cranky

Then what? we know she's from
Bangalore, he met her there only
Surprisingly, today met her
by chance here

lf l punch you, your face
will need a surgery
Hey! think positively!

He saw, isn't it?....
You're thinking about that girl
only isn't it or not? –Yes!
Again, why did he see her
in this city?
What's going on between them?

Some waves are being emanated
from you both, buddy
These simple waves change to love waves
only after you talk to her, remember!
Otherwise, she'll become some other
man's girl friend
...Sorry! l shouted at you
l'll have one more round
l'm Sekhar speaking!
l told you about love waves isn't it!

l met her in Bangalore
...She works with Ford
l couldn't meet her since
l was away!
Suddenly, we saw you both
on road
Met with an accident
we met with a accident
We thought of contacting you
but you vanished
–Yes
You say, you're Reena's friend!
–Yes
But, don't you know that she has
been transferred to this place
Both are just the same!
–Yes!
What do you want now?
We both are family friends
it's an emergency
lf you give her phone number
l'll call her at Bangalore
Her phone number is...
Beach road! 422 is
lndra Nagar exchange
One minute! you know Reena isn't it?
He must get to know her
hereafter only
Get to know her? First, forget
that phone number
We forgot...forgot, we forgot!
Forgot isn't it?
–Yes!
Look Madam, l'm folding hands
and telling you the truth
My friend has fallen in love
with your friend
Look, he has become like this!
He'll not eat and is not
allowing me also to eat
He'll not sleep and is spoiling
my sleep also
He's torturing my life
–shut up
Even if l introduce you to her
or give you her phone number
She'll never talk to you
Why? ls she dumb?
No, she's already engaged!
Her marriage has been fixed
when she was quite young
That's why! l advice you to forget
and not to waste your time
Hey! Rajesh, why're you going away
we're talking about you only! go away!
Leave about him! vegetable seller

Have you decided about your lover?
Lover?
Quick man!
Why're you shouting on him?
What did he do to you?
why're you angry on him?
l never expected such a beautiful
girl will come into my life
l never expected, she'll come
vanish away
ls she gone? then what?
–Have you already decided?
lt has not yet taken off and
you're talking about landing
You've not even approached
that girl yet
She has warned us in so
clear terms isn't it?
That she's engaged and her
marriage has been fixed
Why're you asking me to approach
her even after knowing that?
Already girls don't go down
well with me
And this one to interfere
People like you seeing'Titanic' movie
is a mere waste
ln a gap, didn't the hero make the already
engaged heroine to fall in love
You're right! but, who lost
in the end?
Boy only!
Even in Titanic film!
Girl is only on the safer side
How many liters sir?...2000 liters!
What's it sir?!
–lmpossible isn't it? –Yes!
–Go!
lf you hadn't loved that girl
Why did you jump the median after
leaving me in an accident?
Look! they've passed a New Rule
in the 21st century
A true lover will get his girl
Don't worry about her many suitors
they're not in the list
Buddy love waves! it's running
between your hearts
What's the girl's phone number?
Your date of birth!
Look, you couldn't say it
You could remember that
but couldn't remember this
That's what Love is!
You call her on phone and talk to her
definitely your love will be a success
Yes!
Calling from Telephone dept.
ls your phone working properly?
lt's clear!
–Okay! tell me your address
What happened?
Line got cut.
What did he say?
What did he say?
lt seems he'll come next week.
...He has asked me to take a week off
lt seems, l can't avoid
meeting him
What did you reply for that?
...Before that, line went off
You both must definitely
meet and discuss
Why?
Then, will you marry without
even seeing him
l'll talk to him...l'll...
...ls it Rajeev!?
...Reena's friend
lt seems you wanted to meet Reena
Atleast you have seen her photo
She doesn't even know, how you look
...Son of her Father's friend
...They say, he's good looking
She talked to you on phone thrice
she knows about you, only that
So, first you meet and try
to understand each other
You're coming next week isn't it
l'll make her to take off from Office
What happened?
Again, line's gone dead!
Old man is thinking! Don't know what
problem he's going to create newly
According to you, that boy is coming
from America to meet Reena –Yes
You say, he'll come from America to meet
her, then decide about marriage
That girl hasn't seen him
till now, isn't it?
No!
Did l ask you?
–No!
Keep shut up & listen!
–Yes!
Do you love her so much?
Now, l'll tell you! Still there's a week
for that American to come isn't it?
That means 7 days! ln the meantime
you're going to that girl's house
What's this Subbuni?
What are you saying?
Won't it end in trouble
if l go there?
Yes!
–Then?
lf you go as Rajesh
it'll lead to problems
But, if you go there as that
American boy, Rajeev?
lmpersonating!? lt'll be a
Police case
l'll sew up your mouth!
Just a heart is not enough to
fall in love
You must've courage!
Dear, please listen carefully!
You go there as Rajeev
move closely with that girl
With your magical power of words
you make her to love you
You'll do it!
When she says, l love you
Fall at her feet suddenly
....Then, reveal the truth!
...l'm not the American boy Rajeev
...Problem will be solved
Will it be solved!?
lf it turns serious
lt's quite natural
A girl you love is like Camphor!
...ln anger, she'll burn brightly!
...When calms down! She'll
cool you down
...Don't experiment with his life
Do you think, it'll succeed?
lf it's true love, even a
stone heart will melt
This is just a women's heart
melting it, is very easy
Come on, give me your hand, boy!
l thought your head is empty
you gave an idea!
But, there's an extra large hole!
in your idea! Did you observe it?
ln the one week he makes that
girl to fall in love with him
lf that American boy calls up
even once! He's finished
...He's planning to put us
all behind the bars
You idiot! When you can
think like that?
Do you think, Can't l
think about it?
l've a much bigger idea
than that! Come here!
Tell me, without biting my ear
They've built it to help

Don't talk rot!
Catch this torch light

This torch is also working
Look, l've cut the wire!
ls it telephone cable wire?
Sorry boy! A small technical fault
...ln my haste, l cut my loin thread
...You've escaped!
Cut it man!
lt's okay if it is State Govt. problem
This is Central Govt. problem
They'll kill us with
CBl enquiry...etc.
Phone is ringing! May be it's an
lSD Call from that American Boy.
Cut it!
l'll cut it! You wait!
Look! l've snapped it
Who sent this?
Who sent this?
Flowers again? Are you
making fun of me?
Some mad man is sending me flowers...
...And you're bringing it...

l thought we can open our hearts
and try to understand each other
Difficult...but l'll try!

Phone is out of order for

lndian telephones are always
like this only
American phones never go dead even

What else do you've in chicken?
l think something vegetarian will be
better ...lt'll be good here
When you talked to Uncle you said
you like chicken & Chinese food
That's why, l ordered!
We had met once earlier also
do you remember? -When?
ln Bangalore!
Don't you remember it?
No!
l was 8 years old, then!
Oh! That one! l do remember it nicely
ln your Aunty's marriage you & your pals
locked me up in a dark room
Do you remember it?
–Yes!
Do you know how much l had cried?
–Yes
Uncle also shouted at you!
He's always like that only
Only then, isn't it?
You were always teasing me
lt was only then!
l had only Lucy as my friend then
You remember Lucy isn't it?
l remember nicely
Dark, tall, used to come with
a bobbed hair cut...
Tall? Lucy was my pup!
Even you were giving her a
both with a hose pipe
That's it...lt used come like

Aren't you feeling well?
Nothing!
What's wrong with me?
Whom do you resemble?
–Resemble?
Do you resemble your mother or father?

Resemble grandfather?
Where's he now?
You'll definitely meet him
What's the distance between
Seattle & Chicago?
What's the distance between
Seattle & Chicago?
Didn't you go even once?
Don't you know?
l don't know
Very near!
lf we travel in my car it'll
be just 1 1/2 hours drive
l know all the police en route
no one will stop me
Flight will be very quick! you'll
land before you take off
Nothing! my friend has settled
down there
That's why, l inquired
We'll go...we'll go to meet her
l'll take you there definitely
Why? Aren't you interested
in going abroad?
Going abroad and working there
l like only lNDlA
Foreign country can never become
motherland isn't it?
Say like that
Look's like it's going to work out
in my favour, deal cautiously boy!
l got delayed!
l got up very late
l'm waiting for over an hour
What can l do? my bike never
started even after many kicks
l thought you know the
value of time
l said, sorry isn't it?
Reena! please listen to me
even after l said, sorry...
Don't need an Auto, go away
Where do you want to go, Madam?
Reena, listen to me! l'll also
come, wait – wait
Reena, stop!
l said sorry isn't it?
Sir, don't touch the meter
l know your matter! you watch
carefully & drive
So, what's your plan?
What a sweat?
How could you tolerate such
hot climate?
Do you've mineral water?
Don't lndia have AC Autos?
American Autos are fully AC!
There'll be a bar here we can
enjoy Beer, while travelling
Driver, could you stop Auto little
that side?
Where's he?
–He has escaped, Madam
Here only! stop!
Do you know in America, boys don't
allow the girls to open their purses?
l don't have change, Sir
–No problem!
But, they'll leave half way isn't it?
Suddenly, l met a friend
we last met in our childhood
That's only!...to meet him
–l know all that! l've some work
What's it?
–She left it in the Auto
l'm not able to understand
this girl
Not just this girl, we can never
understand any girl in this world
Till we don't see them, they'll
be just ordinary girls
The moment they'll come to know that
we've fallen in love with them
They'll start behaving, Miss lndia
That's what, l'm also saying
l've a doubt with her behaviour
May be she'll call home and
refuse this marriage
lt's good, with your help that
Rajeev's image is badly bruised
You once again disguise and say
you're Rajesh and marry her
How many disguises?
Like Kamalahasan go on wear as
many disguises us possible  –Yes
l don't know whether your love
will succeed or not
You'll definitely get an Oscar
For such an act, an Oscar?
What?
–What's today's date?
–Yes
Still love waves are working!
Hey! Talk to me......talk to me
Look, she has written birthday
for your attention
She didn't tell me, it's her
birthday today?
Buddy, did you see
she didn't tell him?
Only donkeys like us go on tom tom
about our birthdays
Women are decent
Will they do like that?
She has said it, without saying!
Look! go straight to her!
Before friends take her out!
You take her out and surprize
her with a present –lt.'s good
For my delay and your unhappiness
Can't you give me a chance
to rectify it?
l've come to take you out
so, please come, let's go out
We'll come back soon
Please, don't say no!
lndian traffic don't have
any discipline
No...don't go overboard!
AC chilling is good isn't it?
Why don't you say something?
Okay! tell me!
Where are we going?
Why all this suspense?
lf l don't like it, later
you'll feel bad about it
You don't like it?! no way
you'll definitely like it
Who had arranged it?
This gentleman only isn't it?
You fool! where did you find
this car!?
Sekhar! l'll not spare you!
l'll cut you into pieces
What's this? New method
to start a car?
No, we had fully switched on
AC isn't it?
So Diesel Pump got heated up and
valves got busted
Valves have to come from
Jamshedpur

Come, let's go in a Auto!
Why're you eating like that?
lt's delicious
l had arranged many things
everything has gone haywire
My time is running bad l had to
bring you to roadside push cart
Got late
No! still there are 5 minutes
to strike 12'0'clock
Are you surprized that
how did l come to know it?
Why did you hide it from me?
You wanted to hide it from
me isn't it?
But, l came to know it from
your planner
Why l didn't say because?
it's not my birthday today
Today, it's my friend
Vasuki's birthday
Even this has failed
Sekhar! you're a dead man
No.. nothing
So, you did all this thinking
it was my birthday
lt's not like that
Okay! don't open it
Okay, let's do one thing! l'll buy
a gift to Vasuki on your birthday
Look, l don't have a heart to
take it back with me
So, l brought this for you only
Please take it, l didn't know
what to buy for you
l closed my eyes and thought
about you
l saw this!
lsn't it you?
When you're thinking, sitting
alone in one place
You'll be like this only, isn't it?
l closed my eyes...
thought about you...
l saw this....
...l bought it
This is you, isn't it?
When you're thinking, sitting
alone in a place
You'll be like this only, isn't it?
l closed my eyes and thought

We were discussing about
you only
We were waiting for your
phone call only
Mother! l'm coming
Mother! l'm trying for Reena's phone for
past 4 days with no success

Will you inform her?
No mother, l had told her

So, l'll come to Bangalore later, we'll
go together to Reena's place!
You'll inform Reena, isn't it?
We'll meet at Airport
Alright
Mother! you'll inform her without
fail, isn't it?
Hey, why did you come here?
l should've questioned you
You said that you'll spend time with
me for 5 days
But, why have you come to
the office?
No!
–lt.'s not correct
l have some work, which
l can't avoid
lt's only for 2 hours
You go, l'll meet M.D. & come
Till then, what do you want
me to do?
Don't do anything
Go & sit in the corner
like a good boy
l can't do that
Hello, who's M.D. here?
Then what?
l thought of spending time
romancing you
But, you've made me to sit
in the office
What kind of office is this?
lt's like the colour of
State Transport bus
That's good!
–Alright
Hey, whose file is this?
–Keep quiet
lt's for you
What's it?
No, the phone is out of order at home.
–l know it
l didn't even come to the office
–who's it?...who's it?...
Your father
No Rajeev! Put it down
No, Rajeev
What do you mean by that?
He spoke with me 40 minutes earlier
l also told him that
l'm going to meet you
Why is he calling again?
You....
–Okay
Okay, What l did was wrong?
What had happened to you?
lt won't even take 3 minutes
to talk to him
You're behaving as if, the whole
world is sinking
Yes, My world is sinking
Don't you understand?
Reena, look at me
l can't even waste a single minute
l want to talk to you
l want to hold your hands
That's all!
What do you want me to do?
Okay, Listen
There's a special place

Hey, What's this?
You've brought me here
–l'll tell you
Slowly...Slowly...

You know about me & this
place very well
But, l don't know about you like
lt's easy to read me
l'll tell you about a matter
but, it's a secret
What's it?
–l'll tell you
But, before that, you must tell
me a secret
A secret which no one is aware of
Nothing like that
lt's impossible, A girl without
a secret
Okay, tell me!
–lt's true There's nothing
Shall l tell my secrets?
A girl in the lightning light
Even, she is like a lightning
l lost my heart
Only my life is remaining

She's my friend Arthi
This is Sukanya

According to this, you'll not settle

They're very clear
This is Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh!

clock to Rajeev's family
Hey! you tell me
No one will believe that
Reena is your daughter
How beautiful she is!
Hey you! your son won't
talk like you, isn't it?
Then, it's okay
There's nothing like that
He's very calm like Shyam's mother
He had telephoned Reena 10 times
l know very well that he
likes Reena very much
Because of that, l had sent her photo
Okay, where's Rajeev?
Can't find him at all
Still, he hasn't adjusted to
lndian time
He got up now only & went to bathe
Tomorrow, he'll be conducting
personal interviews in Bangalore
lt's a software body shopping
He's going to select 25 people
We're leaving tonight itself
Okay, why don't we take Reena with
us to Bangalore?
We'll enjoy for 2–3 days
Let Rajeev & Reena come closer
Engagement will be there

Relatives of both the families are
here only, isn't it
Okay, l agree my daughter has
agreed for the marriage
Your son must agree
Where's he?

We'll sit & talk
Yes....yes....
Let them talk...
–Talk to her....

Have it
Give them sweets
–Have it
Do you remember, what l had told you?
We've a big society behind us
Look, a big conference is going on
l'm thinking of taking
you to Bangalore
Will you be able to take any leave?
We had already discussed
about this on phone?
What was he looking like?
....About him?
He's very tall, always smiling
Everything was a foul play
Now, is this very important Vasuki?
No, l asked you because....
& enquired about you
They are Rajesh & Sekhar
l gave your phone number to them
Did you give them?
No..they said, they know you very well
But, l gave them only the phone number...
How did they know about Rajeev?
We've to take it seriously
He has deceived you
They'll get caught, if we
lodge a complaint
Go & tell your Father about this
l had roamed with that fraud
for 5 days
We had laughed together
Then, l had asked him
when will he marry me?
Do you want me to tell these
things to my father?
Did he misbehave with you?
Won't you call this a misbehaviour?
He told lies & deceived me
Everything was wrong?
But, why did he deceive me?
Why did he lie to me?
Why did he impersonate?
l'm scared after reaching here
Will she believe me, that l lied
to her, only for her
You were bold while telling lies....
...But, why are you scared to
tell the truth?
Go, she'll definitely believe you
Okay, you go
–Okay, l'll go...you get in
Why did you come?
Whom do you want to deceive now?
Reena has come to know about everything
How could you behave like this?
l want to talk to Reena, please....
But, Reena won't talk to you
What do you want?
l want to talk to you
Vasuki, ask him to go
l don't want to talk to anyone
Who're you? What's your name?
Please Reena, listen to me
l came here to tell you the truth
But, you already know, haven't
l made myself clear?
Why should l talk to you?
Will you be quiet?
Rajesh, please leave without
creating new problems
Please wait, Vasuki
Let me talk, please
The problem is between us
Vasuki, call Uncle....
Listen to me....
Reena, listen to me...
Look here
Whom do you want to deceive
with these...
Reena, what happened?
Who are you?
–Mind your business
What do you want?
What're you doing here?
Are you misbehaving with
a lonely girl?
Mind your business....
Ravi, don't come here
Why are you still standing here?
Get lost
Vasuki & Ravi come inside
Are you Ravi?
Are you the neighbour of
Reena Joseph?
Are you acting too smart?
Did you hit my friend?
Do you love her?
Love? l'm going to marry her
Hit him
What did you say?
What did you say?
Are you going to marry Reena?
l want to say sorry!
l don't know whether you
remember or not...
During my aunty's marriage
in Bangalore...
l pushed you in to a room
switched off the lights
Locked the doors & went away
And you got scared and
started crying
Even my father scolded me
l came to apologize
But, you had left before
l could reach there
The pardon which was to be
sought at that time
l'm seeking now, after
so many years
When my mother sent your
snap to me...
l felt very happy
But, when l'm meeting you
in person...
l've become speechless
l can't forget these 3 days
But, l won't claim that l've understood
you well in these 3 days
lf l say that then, it's a lie
You need an entire life for that
But, if you're with me all my life
l'll be very happy
l can assure you that
l'm feeling proud that, you're
going to be my wife
Hey, pick it up...pick it up...
Ask Rajesh not to call Reena again?
–Why?
Reena will not talk to him
Rajeev is here only
isn't it?
What do you want me to talk?
You are making mistakes
one after the another
You've also beaten our
neighbour Ravi
Do you know, why?
–There's nothing, l can do
Ask Rajesh to forget Reena?
Hey, what did she say?
What's she going to say?
She's saying, what Reena told her
Look here, forget what she &
Subbuni had said
Our headache is that American person
Only because of him, you are
in problems & dilemma
We'll directly go to him
we'll talk to him
lt's okay, if he listens or else
we'll throw him out
Sir, who are you?
What do you want?
Where's 5E? lt's there
What's the matter?
–Hey! get lost
Come
Can't you open the door & get in?
Hey, who's that, who has come
from America?
Who's that?
Come out
Come out, you coward!
Where are you hiding?
come out!
Will you get your sister
married to me?
l should've asked that question to you
First tell me, who are you?
ls it you, who had come from America?
Hey, what's his name?
Are you Rajeev?
Tell me
Rogue!
Oh! you are the one...
The American person is very handsome
Look here
We've come here to tell you an
important matter
What's that? ls it a
double bedroom?
lt has also got an attached bathroom
Shall we go & talk over there?
Will you switch on the A/C
or shall we go out?
Tell me, what do you prefer?
Wait
l'm asking him, isn't it
Are you dumb from your birth?
Hey, what's it?
We came here to bash him, isn't it
You keep watching..
He's our old enemy, isn't it?
lt's a re–entry
Then, it has become very easy
to throw him out
Why did you come to my house?
To modify your building
–Shut up!
We came here to talk to a person
But, after knowing it's you...
l feel there is no use of
talking to you
Hey, what's there to talk to him?
Look here, American! Listen to me
You dreamed of marrying a girl
isn't it?
That's only a dream
She's your Sister–in–law
Because, he's your elder brother
Did you understand? Come on let's go
–Wait
This is not the game which we had
played in the college
l love her
Even she loves me
There's a problem between us
because of your intrusion
Hey, you've got Dollars
and Green Card
Don't think that, she'll be
flattered with that
Pack up & leave now itself
That'll be good for us
You know that, l'll tell only once
Hey, Look! Horlicks Uncle &
Soap Aunty have come
You're hit by bad time always
lt's going to hit us
if we come with you
Hereafter, we won't come
Hey, l'll break your teeth
Hey, you all went there
You could've at least hit him
Look at the advice, he's giving
We thought of doing that
But, he didn't allow us
l'll break your limbs
Did you tell the American boy
that you are in love with her
We shouted to that extent that
the whole street would've heard
How'll he marry after telling that?
Won't he pack up & leave immediately
No Subbuni!
l know about Samuel very well
Since it's me, he'll not
compromise so easily
l had talked to my Father
He said, Church is okay
He's very happy
l've come for a clarification
Do you know, Rajesh?
He was my Collegemate
We keep fighting always
He said, he loves you
He also said that even you're
in love with him
l know that's not true
l only came to enquire about it
l know him only for 5 days
Yes!
He came to my house as Rajeev
from America
Thinking that, he was you
l talked to him
And closely moved with him
When l came to know, that
it isn't true...
From the moment, l had stopped
talking to him
After that, he tried to
meet me twice
l avoided him
Did he come to you impersonating me?
But, how did he know that
l'm coming... we both....
Don't make this a big issue
l don't want to talk about him
Do you know, what he told me?
He asked me to pack up
& leave the place
Can Rajesh become Rajeev?
lt can never happen
Hereafter, he won't disturb you
Are you Rajeev?
Have you been to America?
At least, have you seen it on a Map?
Now, it has been proved
that you are a localite
Stop....stop...
What's it?
We used to fight in College
Now, we're fighting to real life too
There won't be any fight or
blood shed from my side
l know, where to hit you
This Sunday.... me...
The first invitation is for you
Why is it?
Since, you're my elder brother
isn't it?
No one should come
What's this? Get lost
Hey, tear & throw it
Come, let's go
l want to talk to you
l'm not interested to talk to you
Please, get out from here
Reena, listen to me...
Please, allow me to talk
Please, wait for a minute
Look here, Whatever l've
done is wrong
l accept
l shouldn't have lied to you
But at that time, l never felt that
l was committing a mistake
l had no other choice
l only desired to talk & be
friendly with you, that's all
For which, l've already said sorry
Only one minute
Please, stop for one minute
Kindly listen to me
First time, l saw you in Bangalore
in lightning & rain
Later, l saw you in Rakesh's marriage
After that when l saw you here..
l met Vasuki and collected
your details
l followed you wherever you went
l desired to stay always with you
l got that chance
l came to know that one Mr.Rajeev
was coming to meet you
So, l came as Rajeev to your house
But, l didn't have any intention
of deceiving you
l wanted only your love
...that's all
l never cheated you
even in my dreams
When you said that you too like me...
l thought of telling you the truth
But before that, you came to
know about everything
Hey! what was my mistake?
You had roamed with me for 5 days
l might have taken you anywhere
Even you would have followed me
Because, you had liked me
But l never misbehaved with
you in anyway
l never behaved against
your wishes
Doesn't your heart know about this
Believe me
My love is true
lt's enough if you forgive me
The way you've spoken to me reveals
your real character
ln those 5 days you thought of
taking me anywhere
And you say that l would have
followed you isn't it?
You are a street rowdy, isn't it?
So, you'll talk like this only
But don't think of winning a
girl with your tricks
You can't play with me
On that day you said, you like me
You also asked me, when l am
going to marry you
Don't you like me now?
You?! l don't like you
Why?
Oh! you like only that fellow
Yes! l like him only
Can't you understand me?
What else you want me to do?
l am saying sorry, isn't it?
Before coming to lndia l had seen
an apartment in Seattle
Today morning l contacted my friend
and asked him to purchase it
Reena, your Visa papers
will come tomorrow
l need your passport
l have to give it to the Travel Agent
Have you informed your office or not?
Have you given the notice?
Tell me, what is your problem?
Do you want to talk to her?
You want to talk to Reena
Are you loving her?
Do you want me to tell her
that you love her
Hey! look at me
Look at me...
Look at me, when l am talking to you
You want to know whether
she loves you or not?
Ask her
Now, she is before you, ask her
Reena, today we should conclude
this issue
Why are you keeping quiet?
l am the person who's going
to marry her
Within few days she is going to
be my life partner
l am telling you to talk to her
Shall l go & stand there?
Talk to her
He who tries to win a woman by
force against her wish
He's not at all considered
to be a man
You were a rogue during college days
l thought that you might've
changed by now
But now you have become
an eve–teaser
How many times should l tell you?
Please, l am requesting you
lf l find you at Reena's place again...
l will kill you
Take this...drink it
–No need
Drink..
–No, l don't want it
Hey! drink it
Drink it...
Have this..
Be careful...careful
Buddy, how can he hit him?
ls he a big rowdy?
He dare to do that because
of that girl
Do you think, we'll keep quiet?
Buddy, we should not leave him
He was your enemy in your college
as well as in your life
One word is enough from you we will
admit him in the hospital
Buddy...
Buddy...you are a good person
You had roamed with that girl
and at any time...
At any time...
Did you misbehave with her any time?
You never touched her with
bad intentions
No..isn't it?
You are a very good person
He will be ruined
–Hey, stop your sentiments
Hey! it's alright, if you don't get her
But, he shouldn't get her
Tell him
–Yes
Buddy, think about it
Come....let's go.
Just say a word, we'll bash him up
His chapter will be closed
Take an auto
Come, let's go
Hey, don't leave him, hold him
Hey, what's it?
Why are you acting very smart?
Won't you understand
if we tell you once?
Why don't you leave this place?
Are you asking us to parcel
you to America?
Who are you to parcel me?
Hey! shut your mouth...
Take this
Hey, come on
Hit him
Finish him first...
hit him...
Are you showing your smartness?
Hit him
–Hit..
Buddy, hit him first
Hit him
Don't spare him, hit him
Hit him first
–Rajesh, hit him
Don't spare him, hit him
First, hit him
Don't look, hit him fast
Don't look, hit him first
–Hit him, hit him...
Go away from here
Go away...Go away...
Hey! what's this?
Hey! what happened to you
– Leave me...
Reena likes him only
That's why...
Leave it
lf she doesn't want my love...
What's the use of hitting him?
Hey! where are you going?
l am going to the office, why are you
asking, as if l'm going newly?
Why are you shouting?
Sekhar told me about yesterday's incident
lt's wrong to go and hit him
lt's even worse to return
without hitting him
Leave it Subbuni, there is no
use of hitting him
Then, that girl's chapter is closed
Are you closing that book
without reading it?
From the beginning, l've read
that book upside down
That's why, l had to close it half way
Shall we discuss this tomorrow?
Both the rings are beautiful
l am not able to decide it
Which one do you like? tell me
Even l too don't know
Hey! don't you need the ring?
Tell me
lf l am in a confusion
l'll decide by closing my eyes
Will you decide by closing
your eyes?
Shall l try?
l can see only you
l have seen this also
Do you like it?
After dropping you here
l went to my home
When l closed my eyes to sleep
l had a dream in which you were
searching for me
That's why, l came
Well done my boy
How long will you sit here
come on, tell me
Sekhar told that he'll be coming
Did he say that?
He is waiting for you since
a long time
Hey, Did you agree the
Singapore contract?
Sekhar told me...
Not that
lt seems that Sir's tickets
are also ready
l thought of telling you this...
but before that, you...
For all these years you
had bean saying that
Grandpa Subbuni is there for you
Now, what happened to
Subbuni grandpa?
ls he no more?
Oh God!...grandpa
Hey! then, what is this?
You are not in a position
to forget that girl
lf you go to Singapore
will you forget her?
Tell me
Grandpa leave that...
There is no connection between that
girl and this one
Her chapter is already over
They are paying 6000 dollars
per month in Singapore
Leaving that, what's there
if l stay here
Grandpa this is 1 year contract
l will send you the tickets
within one month
You should come there
Grandpa, l heard that Singapore
girl's are very beautiful
They do something called as...
Sandwich massage
We both will go together
lnstead of enjoying in this age
...if l stay here...
Look Grandpa...
Be cool, grandpa
Come, let's go
Sekhar is waiting for us
We will bear him for some time
Bangalore transfer is some
what difficult...
Father knows few people there
l will contact them and tell you
She is coming
My name is Ravi!
l am....leave it
He's our Rajesh
He's Rajesh's grandpa
He said that he wants to talk to you?
Will you talk....?
Greetings!
Talk to her!
Are you Reena?
–Yes
You know our Rajesh very
well, isn't it?
l'm his grandfather
What do you want now?
l want my grandson
And he wants you
We don't have mental peace
because of his problem
There is a proverb
Perform one marriage even at the
cost of 1000 lies
But, my grandson has spoken
only one lie
Even that, he didn't
speak on his own
He told that lie on my motivation
l told him to tell the truth
with conviction
She will get angry immediately
after knowing the truth
Later slowly that anger
will subside
But, you never understood
his Love
You don't know about Rajesh
He got a job in Singapore
with $10,000
He said, Grandpa is important
for me, not the job
But now, he is going for only $6000
Why?
He's not intrested to stay here
Now, you're more important
to him than me
You are more important than his
life to him
Please, don't bein a haste
Understand him and then say
you love him
But don't say 'No' to him
l had asked Rajesh whether he's
like his father or mother
He had told me that he's
like his grandpa
Are you that grandpa?
You've come very late
So many things had happened
without my knowledge
Still, it's continuing
Nothing is in my hands
You find some other good
girl for Rajesh
At least tell her the truth
at that time
Please, ask Rajesh to forget me
What Subbuni?
Did you hear her advice?
This will not work, Subbuni
Hey, l'm telling you from
my experience
This girl will never
forget my grandson
No Sam!
l had spoken to that
girl several times
She is not at all responding
Oh! l see
lntroduce that girl to me once
l will help you
Hey, Rajeev
What happened to that girl's matter?
Hey, leave that matter
Swimming pool is full of water
With more kick you may fall into it
Be careful!
Hey,Check whether the chicken fry
is ready! Go...
What did l say?
You told to introduce...
Yes....lf you introduce her then l...
One Senior bachelor has come
to meet you
Who?
Has he came to meet me?
–Yes!
Sir, you...
You're American Rajeev, isn't it?
- Yes
Why're you standing?
Please be seated
l'm Rajesh's grandpa
–What's the matter?
l want to talk to you
Regarding?
About my grandson & Reena
l can't understand
My grandson Rajesh & Reena
loved each other
You don't know anything
Don't talk unnecessarily
lt's you, who doesn't
know anything
Rajesh and your Reena....
Not for 1 or 2 days
But for 5 days they both had met
and exchanged their hearts
She even asked him openly
When will you marry me?
lt was wrong to use your name
But, it doesn't mean that she
loves only American Rajeev
Love between Rajesh and Reena
is an absolute truth
You are saying like this...
But when l had spoken to Reena about
this, let me tell, what she said
She requested me not to speak even
a word about Rajesh
Do you understand?
What will you say for this?
Nothing wrong in it brother
She was angry with us
She was angry because
we had told her a lie
That is a type of mock anger
This is quiet common
between lovers
Look, my parents had decided
long back our marriage
l've also decided!
l like her very much
Okay! Sunny....Okay!
You & your parents, Elders would've
decided about Betrothal & Marriage
But, did everyone ever tried to ask
what's there in her heart?
No!
Shall l tell you, what's
there in it?
Love!
You talked big about betrothal,Marriage
...this...and that.. Auspicious time
They can be changed at any time
They'll change according to
our will & wish
But, Love will never change
under any circumstances
Because, it is equal to God
As said by you
Love is equal to God
But, your grandson doesn't
know anything about it
All he knows is fights & Brawls
Even after knowing that l'm
going to marry Reena
...He's trying to spoil it
with jealousy
Son! l'm saying this with
good will for you only
Knowing very well that there's some one
else in that girl's heart
...lf you marry her!
Will your life be happy?
l'm happy for your concern
about my happiness
Look! Don't waste your time
Why are you running all around
at this old age?
Get me an lnvitation Card!
Tomorrow our marriage will
definitely take place!
Don't say another word!
Please go away
You don't worry! our boys will
lay siege to their house
...They'll enter their house and
create trouble
They'll somehow stop the marriage
ls it Okay?
Yuck!
–What yuck?
You want to slip silently to
Singapore tomorrow isn't it?
Wherever you may go, you can never
forget her even for a moment
l can't forget her! Yes!
l've not forgotten her even now
But, l can forget her!
...l'll forget her
Hey! What's the time?
Shall we go now?
What's it?
Looks like l'll cast an
evil eye myself
Do you know how beautiful
you look?
What's this urgency?
You'll spoil my Rose
Why do you need a Rose?
Give it to the groom
ls it?
Then, for me? -Are you the groom?
...Come with me
Flight is at 7.30, l must
be at Airport by 5.30
Come!
Come!
Dear People!
We've gathered here to unite this man
& woman as husband & wife
These both are getting married
in your presence
Who's going to give away
the bride?
...The vows taken by them...

Merciful father!
...The marrying couple should
understand each other!
...Filling their lives with Love
l'll check in & come!
Rajeev Samuel, do you accept
Reena Joseph as your wife
...And will you live with her
all your life?
Rajeev Samuel, do you accept
Reena Joseph as your wife
And will you live with her
all your life?
l've to discuss with Reena
l thought this marriage is
happening with your consent
But, after coming here
l feel it is not
Why're you like this?
Don't you like this marriage?
l'm asking you only!
l didn't ask to make you cry
...l'm...why're you behaving like
this after coming here?
You're the bride
But, there's no happiness
visible on your face
Why?
But, l love you!
ln happiness or sorrow
l love you
l love you in my thoughts
and deeds
l desired to marry you
But, l want to know whether l'm
there in your heart
You said isn't it? When you're confused
you'll close your eyes & decide
Close your eyes now and tell me
...Am l there in your heart?..
....Or that Rajesh?
...Do it once for me!
...Do it once for me!
lf you give me an auspicious thread
and marriage band cassette
....l'll marry you, right now!
Hereafter, l'll not decide after
closing my eyes!
....l'm leaving it to you!
Rajeev... What happened?
Shall l talk to her?
Rajeev Samuel, do you accept
Reena Joseph as your wife
And live with her all your life
l'll go, grandpa
Look! l'm sending you ticket
in a month!
You're coming there! We both are
settling down in Singapore
Are you going to Singapore?
Are you going on getting a job?.....
....Or going off defeated?
Why're you going away?
Before you go away! Shall we decide
between us once for all?
No, Sam!
....Live happily!
....l had only won in this war
....l can say it confidently!
l'm getting late for my flight
...l'm going!
You can go! but one important thing
l've a stroke, still left
l can marry Reena and take her
with me in just 2 days
You may not know even her
where abouts all your life
You'll get depressed with
her memories
l can enjoy it happily
& be happy
Last stroke is mine
You can't live with that, isn't it?
Hey! What are you blabbering?
Wait a minute!
l never told this before with you
...You're very beautiful
l did present her with a ring!
l didn't marry her
She likes you!
You!
That's why, l've brought her to you
You won over me in just 5 days
She's all yours!
l can never forget our relationship
....l'm your friend always!
We both will always remain
as enemies
There can never be any
friendship between us
l closed my eyes & saw
l saw you
My name is Rajesh!
l'm not from America
l'm a local Andhra Man
l love you!
