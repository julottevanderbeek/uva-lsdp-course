Five hundred twenty-five
thousand six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty-five
thousand moments so dear
Five hundred twenty-five
thousand six hundred minutes
How do you measure,
measure a year?
In daylights, in sunsets
In midnights,
in cups of coffee
In inches, in miles,
in laughter, in strife
How about love?
How about love?
How about love?
Measure in love
Seasons of love...
Love
Seasons of love
Love
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six
hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
journeys to plan
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six
hundred minutes
How do you measure the life of a woman or a man?
In truths that she learned
Or in times that he cried
In bridges he burned
Or the way that she died
It's time now to sing out
Though the story never ends
Let's celebrate
Remember a year
in the life of friends
Remember the love...
Oh, you got to, you got
to remember the love...
You know that love
is a gift from above
Share love, give love,
spread love
Measure
Measure your life in love
Seasons of love...
Love
Seasons of love
Love.
KURT: Three weeks to the
day since his funeral,
What
:
Rachel?
I'm going now.
You know, I've cleared
my entire schedule
to provide my services
to students and faculty,
and not a single person's
come in for grief counseling.
Well, maybe that's because
you're not a certified
grief counselor.
Maybe that's because
you're just the jittery,
mentally-ill bird lady
they turn to
to find out what college
they won't be attending
because they missed
the application deadline.
If students wish to mourn
Finn's passing, they're free
to visit the memorial garden
that I erected.
I planted a tree in
the exact location
where I caught Finn
and Quinn Fabray fondling
each other's breasts.
Come on, Sue. BEISTE:
How can you even
joke at a time like this?
SUE: Oh, take it easy,
Post-Op Michael Chiklis.
I'm grieving.
And I grieve by insulting those
who mean the most to me.
It's just a coincidence
that it's also what I do
when I'm not grieving.
It just feels so surreal.
They don't make 'em like Finn.
He was our quarterback.
We honor Finn Hudson by taking
care of the people he loved,
and the way we do that
is by helping them to move on.
How?
By not making a self-serving
spectacle of our own sadness.
And I think we can all agree,
that's what Finn
would have wanted.
I'm really glad so many of you
could make it back for this.
MIKE: We wouldn't miss it
for anything, Mr. Shue.
The funeral
was for everyone, but I wanted
to do something just for us.
To memorialize him
the only way we know how...
by singing.
All week long.
Anyone who wants to
can come up and sing.
Maybe a song he sung,
maybe something that
reminds you of him...
Singing isn't going
to bring him back.
No, it's not.
Nothing is.
Not ever.
But... for two minutes or so,
we can all maybe remember
the best parts of him.
So, think of
what you want to sing,
if you want to sing,
and we'll start tomorrow.
Oh, I-I can't wait
until tomorrow, Mr. Shue.
I've been bawling
for three weeks.
If I don't get this all out now,
I don't think
I'll ever stop crying.
Sure, Mercedes. Start us off.
Um...
I, uh, remember Finn telling me
that he sang this song
to his baby's sonogram.
Well, he thought
it was his baby.
He was the first cool kid
to be nice to any of us,
and he was...
our leader in here.
We love you, Finn.
Oh
Why you look so sad?
Tears are in your eyes
Come on and come to me now
Don't
Be ashamed to cry
Let me see you through
'Cause I've seen
the dark side, too
When the night falls on you
You don't know what to do
Nothing you confess
Could make me love you less
I'll stand by you
I'll stand...
By you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
So
If you're mad, get mad
Don't hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now
And hey
What you got to hide?
I get angry, too
Well, I'm a lot like you
When you're standing
at the crossroads
And don't know
which path to choose
Let me come along
'Cause even if you're wrong
I'll stand by you
Oh
I'll stand by you
Nobody hurt you, no
Take me in,
into your darkest hour
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Won't let nobody... hurt you
No, no, no, no
Oh, yeah
Into your darkest hour
I'll never
Desert you...
I'll stand by you
No, no, no
I'll stand by you.
Sweet, gentle Porcelain,
I know you were instrumental
in raising the funds
for the tree in the memorial
garden in Finn's honor.
All I did was drive
to Home Depot
and buy a tree
for $20, but, yes.
Well, it looks like
we're gonna have to dip
into your West Village Halloween
Parade Assless Chap Fund
once again.
Tree is gone.
Someone's vandalized
the memorial.
I don't understand! Why would
someone do something like that?
Who knows?
Grief can bring out
the irrational in all of us.
I'll take that $20
for a new tree, please.
I prefer exact change.
Thanks.
KURT: I marked these boxes so it'd
be easier to separate things.
Thanks, honey.
You don't have to do this now.
It can wait.
There's no timetable.
CAROLE: No.
We should do it now, or...
I'm afraid I'll never do it.
KURT:
Look.
It's the ball from the
first game we ever scored at.
You should keep this, Dad.
That was the weirdest
football game I ever been to.
Look, it's the faggy lamp
from my Marlene Dietrich
basement redecoration.
I think he kept it in here
to prove a point to Burt.
BURT:
You know, if it's, uh,
okay with everyone, I think
I'd like to keep that lamp.
No. It's not okay with me.
That thing is awful.
BURT:
I need a lamp
in my office at the shop.
I tore into him about this lamp.
You know, I was right,
in principle,
but, you know, come on.
The kid didn't have
a prejudiced bone in his body.
I knew what he meant when
he was calling it "faggy."
I wasn't teaching him
a lesson in tolerance,
I was teaching myself one,
and he was just unlucky enough
to be there for it.
CAROLE: Finn knew how you
felt about him, honey.
He kind of liked it
when you yelled at him.
Should've hugged him more,
you know?
No, it was always...
you know, we'd fist-bump
or we'd high-five, but...
I should've given him more hugs.
You know, the last
time I saw him,
he was so bummed out about
some test at school, and...
I just, you know...
told him
to get back at it, you know?
He was worth it.
: It was
the perfect time for a hug.
But for whatever reason,
I just...
I gave him a pat on the back...
and that's that.
Now he's gone.
KURT:
Oh, d-don't.
I need that.
I want it.
Seeing him come into the
hallway wearing this...
it was like Superman
had arrived.
:
God, his arms were long.
I always thought
that when I, uh...
How do parents go on
when they lose a child?
You know, when I would see
that stuff on the news,
I'd shut it off, 'cause it was
just too horrible to think,
but I would always think:
how do they wake up every day?
I mean, h-h...
how do they breathe, honey?
But you do wake up.
And for just a second,
you forget.
And then...
oh, you remember.
And it's like getting
that call again...
and again, every time.
You don't get to
stop waking up.
You have to keep on
being a parent,
even though you don't get
to have a child anymore.
What's with, uh,
the Banksy loser parade?
You're exhausting.
You seriously don't
recognize this Dumpster?
Oh, yeah.
KURT: Soon as Finn joined
the Glee Club, being a loser,
an outcast and a misfit,
it... it all became okay.
Hey, give me that jacket.
Seriously, I'll pay you for it.
I'm sure you have a whole
room full of mementos.
I got nothing to
remember him by.
Well, you can't have this.
That jacket is reserved
for people who earned it.
I'm not gonna let you
bedazzle it with glitter
and turn it into some
shawl.
So what are you gonna do,
beat me up and take it from me?
Throw me in a Dumpster?
You can't have it.
Just yesterday morning
They let me know
you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made
Put an end to you
I walked out this morning
And I wrote down this song
I just can't remember
who to send it to
I've seen fire
and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days
That I thought
would never end
I've seen lonely times
When I could not
find a friend
But I always thought
That I'd see you again
Won't you look down
upon me, Jesus
You gotta help me
make a stand
You just gotta see me
through another day
ARTIE & SAM :
My body's aching
And my time is at hand
I won't make it
any other way
Oh, I've seen fire
And I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days
That I thought
would never end
I've seen lonely times
When I could not
find a friend
But I always thought
:
That I'd see you again.
Hi, Santana.
Shouldn't you be with
Tina in Glee Club?
I-I don't mean to pry...
it's just,
I had Tina mourning in song
with the Glee Club
until 10:45 at the earliest.
No, I had to get out of there.
Felt like my head
was gonna explode.
SANTANA:
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What the hell
do you think you're doing?
Principal Sylvester told us
the candles have to go.
She said she got a call
from the fire marshal.
You cannot let her do this.
Um, he's the janitor.
JANITOR:
New Santana Lopez
is right, Old Santana Lopez.
Under the tyrannical
jackboot of Sylvester regime,
I am powerless,
and I am too overcome
with Finn Hudson-related grief
to fight back.
Okay, this is...
this is insane.
SUE: Well, Donna,
one of us farted,
and I'm about 60% sure
it wasn't me.
You have no right
to take down that memorial.
Well, as a matter of fact,
I do, Sandbags. I allowed
that memorial to remain in the
hallway for over a week. Oh, please.
You wanted that memorial gone
because you're such
a coldhearted bitch.
What did you just call me?
A miserable,
self-centered bitch,
who has spent
every waking minute
of the past three years trying
to make our lives miserable.
I'm officially over it.
I don't care for your attitude.
Well,
I don't give a hot wet monkey's
ass what you care for.
You are not my principal.
See, I don't go here
anymore, Sue,
and that means
I can finally tell you
exactly what I think of you.
I have hated you
ever since the day I met you.
You are a horrible person
who never had a nice word
to say about Finn Hudson,
so don't you dare think
for a second
that he didn't hate you, too!
If I were you, I would choose my
next few words very carefully.
What are you gonna do?
You gonna expel me?
You get the hell
out of my office!
How about you make me get
the hell out of your office?
Donna, call the police.
Donna, you pick up that phone,
and I swear to God,
I will shove my foot so far...
That's assault!
No, this is assault!
Tina, I'm really glad that
you took the time
to come talk to me today.
I know a lot of young people
have trouble expressing
feelings of sadness.
I just don't know how
much longer I can do this.
Do what?
I just don't know how much
longer I can wear black.
I feel like this look is
so Tina two years ago.
And I spent so much time
transitioning away from goth,
and look at me... it's, like,
I'm back in that look.
Okay, yeah.
I'm just gonna see
what I... have
in my drawer here.
Okay. All right.
So, why don't you
have a look at these...
on your way out.
Okay?
Okay.
All right.
Hey, right on time
for your 1:30.
I'm happy some people are
finally coming to you for help.
Mm-hmm. But I don't think
I need grief counseling.
Have a seat.
Come on.
Will, I was with you when
you found out that Finn died.
Okay? I stood right next
to you at the funeral.
And I couldn't help
but notice something.
What?
You haven't cried.
What are you saying, that...
that-that I don't feel anything?
No, that's
not what... Of course I
feel something, Emma.
I-I feel...
I feel more than I know
how to express. I...
I'm heartbroken.
To be honest,
I don't even know how
we're all supposed to move
forward, but in the meantime,
I have to make sure
that the people
around me are taken care of.
Okay. Okay.
Look, I-I... this... Listen to me.
Listen...
Listen to me; listen.
I love you, okay?
I know. Whatever you feel and
however you want to show it,
that's okay.
I just...
I think there's
gonna come a time
when you need to... let it
all out, and I want you to know
that I plan on being here
for you when you do.
I have to get back to class.
Okay.
You're drunk.
You're beautiful.
You puke in my locker room,
you're cleaning it up.
Come on...
what's the big deal?
I get needing something to get
through the first few days,
but it's been a month.
You don't have to be scared
to have feelings.
That's crap!
Of course I do!
Why?
We're all having 'em!
Not like mine!
No one understands!
Understands what?
Tell me!
That if I start crying,
I don't think I'll ever stop!
Finn would've kicked over
one of my chairs.
Yeah.
That was his specialty.
Sit down.
Come here.
:
I can't take it...
What chance do I have
of not being an idiot
and hurting people
without him around
to remind me who I really am?
You just got to do that
for yourself now...
and see yourself
how he saw you.
It's not good enough for me!
It's not like when he was alive.
:
You got to make it good enough,
because it's all we got left.
And I'm telling
you this straight,
'cause that's how
you and I talk.
He's dead...
and all we've got left is
his voice in our head.
I'm sorry, but it's time you...
you got to be your
own quarterback.
Do you think we could...
retire his number?
Kurt has his letterman jacket.
Maybe... maybe we could
frame it or something,
and put it up in here.
Mm.
Other kids should
know who he was.
Years from now.
Yeah.
I can get that done.
But you got to promise
to put the tree back.
I didn't take the tree.
Fine, I took the tree.
Mm-hmm.
It was a garbage tree, though.
It wasn't big enough.
They grow, you know.
Okay, I know that Finn had
his doubts about God,
but I am convinced
that Squishyteets is up
in Heaven right now,
plopped down next to his new
best friend Fat Elvis,
helping themselves to a picnic
of baby back ribs
smothered in butterscotch
pudding and tater tot grease,
so, this is for you, Hudson.
If I die young,
bury me in satin
Lay me down
on a bed of roses
Sink me
in the river at dawn
Send me away
with the words of a love song
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Lord, make me a rainbow
I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know
I'm safe with you
When she stands
under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what
you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray,
but she buries her baby
The sharp knife
of a short life
Oh, well, I've had
Just enough time
Ooh, yeah
So put on your best, boys,
and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
Oh, if I die young
Bury me in satin
Lay me down
on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river
at dawn
Send me away
with the words of a love song
Oh, oh...
SANTANA:
No, no. No! No!
KURT:
You okay?
You sang beautifully.
I couldn't do it.
There was only
one more chorus.
No, not the song.
I had this whole plan
to surprise everyone
and not be a bitch
for once in my life
and say all these
nice things about Finn,
and then, at the last minute,
I chickened out.
I even wrote them all down.
Would you read it to me?
No, I can't.
It's too embarrassing.
They're, like, really nice.
If there's one thing
I've learned from Finn dying,
it's that shame
is a wasted emotion.
I'm sure Finn had secrets,
too, but who cares now?
Do you really think,
one day, on your deathbed,
you're gonna think, "Oh, good,
no one knew I was kind?"
Okay.
"When we had sex,
Finn never stopped asking me
"if I was okay the whole time,
"and he meant it.
"One time, Becky Jackson left a
piece of chocolate birthday cake
"on my chair,
and when I sat on it,
"it looked like I
had pooped my pants,
"and, so, Finn walked behind me
until I could get out of school
"so no one saw
my chocolate butt
and thought that
I had messed myself."
Yeah, you would've never
lived that one down.
No.
He was a much better
person than I am.
That is true.
But Finn really
cared about you.
And I don't think he would've
done all those things
if he didn't think
you were decent, too.
Can you leave, please?
Well, we busted out
of class
Had to get away
from those fools
We learned more from
a three-minute record, baby
Than we ever learned
in school
Tonight I hear
the neighborhood drummer sound
I can feel my heart
begin to pound
You say you're tired
And you just want
to close your eyes
And follow your dreams down
Well, we made a promise
We swore
we'd always remember
No retreat,
baby, no surrender
Well, now young faces
grow sad and old
And hearts of fire grow cold
We swore blood brothers
against the wind
And I'm ready
to grow young again
And I hear your sister's voice
calling us home
Across the open yards
Well, even we could cut
someplace of our own
With these drums
and these guitars
'Cause we made a promise
We swore
we'd always remember
No retreat,
baby, no surrender
Blood brothers
on a summer's night
With a vow to defend
No retreat,
baby, no surrender
No retreat
Baby, no surrender.
I love you guys.
Where is it, Puckerman?
It's just a tree.
I told Beiste I'd put it back.
No, not the tree.
Finn's jacket.
I went for a lie-down
in the nurse's office,
hung it up
on the coat rack by her door,
and when I woke up from
my grief siesta, it was gone.
I know you took it.
We  know you took it.
I didn't take a jacket.
If we were rounding up
the usual suspects, that would
pretty much just be you.
I didn't take Finn's jacket!
Enough!
Please!
No fighting this week.
WILL: Santana?
Seriously, Puck,
you can keep it tonight,
but I need it back tomorrow.
All right?
It's Santana's now.
I swear I didn't swipe
the jacket, Mr. Shue.
I understand
wanting the jacket, Puck.
And I'm not saying
that you took it.
I didn't.
But if you did,
all I'm gonna say is
that all of us want some piece
of Finn to keep close to us.
I owe you an apology.
Have a seat.
Okay, look, all I can say is
that I'm really...
Shut up.
You were absolutely right.
Everything you said,
you were right.
I was horrible to that kid,
and I'm utterly destroyed
that he died
thinking I didn't like him.
Well, maybe this, uh,
could be a lesson.
You know, maybe
you could start being nicer...
Oh, cut the crap, will you?
I don't care about that.
I don't care about people.
I care about him.
He was such a good guy.
And I'll never get to tell him.
There's no lesson here,
there's no happy ending.
There's just nothing.
He's just gone.
He would have made
an excellent teacher.
I thought
I'd spend the next 30 years
teaching alongside him.
I thought I had all the time
in the world
:
to rail against him
and his dopey little Glee Club.
Oh, it's just so pointless.
All that potential.
Just...
This is sort of cheesy.
RACHEL:
No, it's beautiful.
I just had to see it.
Nobody treat me
with kid gloves, okay?
I don't know
what to say, either.
:
I loved Finn, and...
...he loved me,
and he loved all of you guys.
I know he did.
I like to sing in
the car and, um...
: and before Finn,
I used to sing alone...
...and this was
the first song that I...
sang with him when we would...
drive around together, so...
this is for him.
When the rain
Is blowing in your face
And the whole world
Is on your case
I could offer you
A warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows
And the stars appear
And there's no one there
To dry your tears
I could hold you
For a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you haven't
made your mind up yet
But I would
never do you wrong
I've known it
from the moment
That we met
No doubt in my mind
Where you belong
I'd go hungry
I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling
Down the avenue
No, there's nothing
That I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love
Oh, the storms are raging
On the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change
Are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen
nothing like me yet
I could make you happy
Make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends
of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love.
That's a pretty hefty reward.
It's not a reward;
it's bait.
I'm gonna kick the crap out of
whoever brings that jacket back.
And I want it back
before I go home.
Home... here home?
New York.
That's my home now.
I'm not coming back here
for a while.
More than a while.
Maybe never.
You know, I used
to love coming here,
but now this just reminds me
of everything that I've lost.
I understand.
You should go.
Well, geez, Mr. Shue,
you don't have to rush me
out of the door.
I'm a teacher.
It's supposed to make me happy
to see my kids grow up
and leave the nest.
Does it?
Well, I can say for a fact that
it certainly beats
the alternative.
:
Hey.
What...?
It's root beer.
Oh.
Mmm.
Mmm.
So, what do you think?
when this tree 30 feet tall
and the kids come
to make out under it,
will they know
who it was planted for?
Probably not.
You know what's tripping me out
is this line
between the two years.
It's his whole life.
Everything that happened
is in that line.
What are you gonna do
with your line now, Puckerman?
I'm gonna make a man of myself.
Figured if I don't have Finn,
I need an army to help me.
Are you serious? The army?
Air Force, actually.
Thought maybe I could be
a top gun.
I think they were actually
Naval aviators in that movie.
You know, if Finn was around,
I'd just keep letting him
point me in the right direction.
Now...
it's up to me
to figure it all out.
I'm proud of you.
You know?
Just don't get shot, okay?
Thanks, Coach.
Keep watering that tree.
You got it.
Have a good line.
Hey, Mr. Shue.
Hey, Rachel.
I get flashbacks when you walk
in here and say that.
Good ones.
How are you doing?
Everyone keeps asking me that.
Well, from what I hear,
you've been a rock for everyone,
so I know that that means
that sometimes you don't get
to grieve yourself.
I'm okay.
I mean, I'm...
I'm really not okay,
but, uh, yeah,
I'm-I'm okay.
More importantly, how are you?
I have no idea.
I talk to him a lot.
I can still see his face
and can hear his voice
so clearly.
Do you think
that I'll ever forget it?
'Cause I'm afraid
that one day, I will.
What do you talk to him about?
Anything.
I mean, when we were dating,
it was, you know,
pretty much me talking
all the time
and him just pretending
to listen,
so it's not really
that different.
I had it all planned out.
I was gonna make it big
on Broadway
and maybe do
a Woody Allen movie.
And then when we were ready,
I would just...
come back,
and he'd be teaching here,
and I'd walk
through those doors,
and I would just say,
"I'm home."
And then we would live
happily ever after.
It's a good plan.
Did you tell him?
I didn't have to.
He knew.
And...
now what?
I don't know.
Something different.
Maybe something better.
I just... I don't think
that that's possible.
He was my person.
But thank you so much
for doing this.
I felt like I didn't know
if I would be able
to sing again,
but now I know that I can.
And I know that there have been
a lot of memorials for him,
but I had this made,
and I was hoping
that we could hang it in here.
Did he really say that?
He was smart, just, you know,
in an... in an untraditional
kind of way.
Come on, let's... let's
hang it right over there.
