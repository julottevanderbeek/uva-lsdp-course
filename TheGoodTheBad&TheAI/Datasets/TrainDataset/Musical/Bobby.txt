- I did it in fun.
- Is he of your age?
Nobody's of my age here.
He's being a pest!
Keep him with you. Go now!
- You forgot me, eh?
- How can anyone forgetyou?
You don't look a mother of a six
year old boy. You look sweet 16!
This is your son, right?
My dear darlingchild...
Now give a kiss to Aunty.
Come on.
He bit me!
Haven't you taught him
any manners or etiquettes?
An absolute brute!
Your son here, bit my cheek!
He should be thrown out!
Send him to a Reform-school.
- Apologise!
- No!
What if somebody forces
you to kiss?
Hey! He's just a kid.
Does one hit a kid like this?
- Shut up! Is this your upbringing?
- Hush! I didn't teach him to be rude.
- A kid's conduct is a mother's job.
- When have you let me be a mother?
Two woolens coats.
Convince the Master, Madam.
How will he stay without his parents?
Didn't you think of this before?
We trusted you with him...
...and he got spoilt.
We never realised that you...
...that you're a servant here,
and not his mother.
I may not be his mother,
but I was like a mother to him.
And if that's the case,
excuse me for being blunt...
But you didn't even breast-feed him.
Are you a mother?
Today I'm really very happy,
but very sad too.
Sad because you've been with me for
so many years, and I love you all.
But today, my heart is
heavy to bid you goodbye.
I'm also glad to see you all step
in this world in the real sense.
From today your life is your own.
I'll remind you once more...
...that you've to find your ways
and your goals, yourself.
Take your decisions, yourself.
Believe me...
...success is simply impatient
to come to you.
What's your programme?
Staying back for the function?
I want to and I've sought my
parent's permission. Let's see.
There's our principal who tells
us to take our own decisions...
...and here's Mama's boy, who has
to seek permission to enjoy them?
These are our fun days.
Why seek permission to enjoy them?
You're very late. How was the party?
- Very nice.
- Are you staying up for me?
- No. I had some work to finish.
Go and sleep.
I'll come later.
There are some letters for you
on the table. Take them.
- It's from Raja.
- What says he?
That his papers have gone well.
And asks, "Can I stay back for
our farewell function on the 24th?"
- On the 23rd.
- 23rd? Then how can he stay back?
No. I'm going to celebrate
his birthday very grandly.
It's a good excuse to invite
my clients and business friends.
Also, he'll come to know the ropes
by socialising with people here.
Inform him to come
back immediately.
Well, Mama's boy...
All packed and ready to go, eh?
Yes. My parents wish that
I reach home by the 23rd.
- It's my birthday.
- Really?
How old will you be?
- 18!
Don't be funny.
You still have your milk-teeth!
- I'm doing some work.
- Must be penning a poem.
People go out in the evenings to
seek a muse for their poetry.
And this guy here...
Come, I'll show you something.
To hell with you!
I've brought a poetry in motion!
One look, and you'll pen
ten odes to her!
I'll burn that diary of yours!
Can't you spare me a moment?
Come on.
Look towards the gate.
- There's a limit to...
- Listen, will you?
Cool it. You've your whole life
to pen poetry. But a girl like...
Aren't you ashamed?
What if your parents find out?
Don't get worked up now.
Are our parents losing sleep over us?
I tell the truth, that's why
people get disturbed.
Tell me the truth. Do you
love your parents? Be honest.
I don't lie!
Shall I tell you? You don't love
them, because they don't love you!
Love begets love. They had you,
and then dumped you here!
Who has the time nowadays to
hold their kids to their hearts?
The world is moving fast, and,
we all have to keep up with it.
I want to be with the world.
I must find a friend a, who
won't ditch me when eed arises.
- I'm home.
- Hello, sir.
Where's my Mummy?
She had a meeting to attend.
She asked me to look after you.
- And Daddy must be in his office.
- Yes, sir.
Bless you. How you've grown!
A chip of the old block!
Happy? I was worried that the party
is tomorrow and still no sign of you.
- Thought we'd have to cancel it.
- That would've been a problem.
Okay son, I'll go now.
I've some important work pending.
Listen, I too left the meeting
half way. They'll wait for me.
- I'm late as it is.
- Come along then.
Okay, take a wash and have lunch.
See you in the evening.
And if you need anything,
beckon Ramdhin.
Love begets love. They had
you and dumped you here!
Who has the time nowadays to
clasp their kids to their bosoms?
- You're all dolled-up.
- Why?
Waiting for someone, eh?
- Your son's not to be seen.
- I was about to say the same.
He's a bit shy. There were
no girls in his class, you see.
Please go upstairs and call him.
I've to attend to my guests.
- Which room?
- The one on your right.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
- Has he bathed?
- Sure...
What's all this? I'll get him.
No, I'll call him myself.
You're knocking my door now?
Didn't you know it earlier?
I knew, but...
Well, I didn't know that...
...you'd treat your home,
like your boarding school.
Pass me that gown, please.
Who are you and what are
you doing here?
I'm Neema.
I'm a dancer and
run a dancing school.
- I'm your mom's Bridge partner too.
- My mom, and the party's downstairs.
I know. Your mom has called
you downstairs immediately.
At once? Like this?
You go ahead. I'll come later.
Wait here.
I'll just come.
Excuse me for coming uninvited.
Congratulations for today.
Raj, I've baked a cake for Raja.
A sponge cake. His favourite.
Take this from her.
- Happy Birthday, Sonny.
- Congratulations.
Congratulations...
Happy birthday.
Now come along.
Give a kiss to your Aunty.
Hold on. You won't
bite my cheek, will you?
Why are you gaping at him?
When you were a kid...
you had bitten my cheek.
And I had screamed...
Help! He bit my cheek.
He's not a kid any more.
Just gave his Senior Cambridge.
Is that so? Then it's okay.
Come along then. Give me a kiss.
Naughty boy! Anyway...
It's okay you did it to me.
But don't try it on a girl, else,
she'll give you a sound beating.
I won't beat you!
I know a secret about Raj...
which is not known by anybody.
And I'm happy to share with you all.
And the secret is that Raj doesn't
just have a beautiful body...
- What are you doing?
...but a wonderful heart too.
And this is proved by the fact
that Raj is a good poet...
...and pens lovely poems.
On all your behalf...
I now request him to recite
a song, a poem, a couplet...
No... I don't know any poem.
I've never penned any couplet...
- Have you taken over my life?
- Recite or sing it.
If I say I can't sing,
You'll get some proof that I can!
- You mean you can sing too?
- Yes. He sings and I dance.
"I'm no poet"
"I'm no poet"
"But my pretty one..."
"ever since I have seen you..."
"poetry has just come to me"
"I'm no lover either"
"But dear lovely one..."
"ever since I set eyes on you..."
"I've become a lover"
"I'm no poet"
"I had heard of love, no doubt"
"But I didn't know
what it was"
"I remained confused
as confusions generally are..."
"and remained an enemy
in friends"
"But I'm no foe..."
"but dear pretty one..."
"having seen you..."
"I have learnt to make friends"
"I'm no poet"
"Had I really prayed..."
"and lifted my hands...
what would I have asked for?"
"But ever since I've fallen
in love with you..."
"I've begun to pray"
"But I'm no atheist"
"I'm no disbeliever in God"
"But dear lovely one..."
"Ever since I have seen you..."
"I have come to believe"
"I'm no poet"
"But my dear pretty one..."
"ever since I have set
my eyes on you..."
"poetry just came to me"
"I'm no poet"
See? All the richie-rich had
come to celebrate your birthday.
See the presents? There's no room
to keep them! Where are you going?
- To bed! I'm fagged out.
- So am I.
You also relax, son.
The same aroma...
Exactly the same.
I know Aunty,
but who's this Bobby?
He has gone out, Master Raj.
What can I do for you?
- Do you know where this Aunty lives?
- Which Aunty?
Mrs Braganza, who was my
governess when I was a baby.
I came here later. Ramdhin must
be knowing. Shall I call him?
No, don't bother.
I'll find out for myself.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
Me? Who's me?
Well?
- Well, say something.
- You, and here?
Me? Where else will I be?
But, you?
Aunty...
Aunty lives here, doesn't she?
- Aunty? Yours or mine?
- Mine. Mrs Braganza.
- Yes, she stays here... so?
- Well... I just...
What 'just'? Hurry up.
My oil's burning.
Who is it?
- God knows. Some nephew of an Aunty!
What do you want?
Tell me. Whom do you want?
I won't. You tell me, why
didn't you meet me on my birthday?
Raja? My darling child?!
Such a small bundle of joy
grew up to be so big? Bend down.
I can't see you properly.
Dear Lord...
Save him from my evil eye.
A mother never looks at her kids
with an evil eye, Aunty.
You call me Aunty and mother in
one breath, eh? Sit down now.
- I had left a cake for you. Eat it?
- That's why I ran here for more.
- Is there any left?
- Of course.
You mean you came for my cake?
But of course.
To eat the cake, and...
...and, make friends with
your son, Bobby.
My son? He's of your Dad's age.
His name is Jack. And Bobby...
Want to be friends with me?
- A bin!
- What?
Nothing. There's a fat girl in
our class. We call her a "Bin".
Actually her name is Jyoti.
Like yours is Raja.
- Be polite. Call him Master Raja.
- It's all the same, Gran.
- Isn't it?
- Yes, yes it is.
She's very naughty.
She's always asking about you.
Who? Where? How?
And that cake I made for you...
She signed her name on that too!
- Yes, I had seen it.
- Do you still draw?
Gran says you had used a man's
black coat as a black board once.
You had drawn a big figure on it.
There was a woman...
What was her name?
- Do you remember biting her?
- Yes, and she had screamed...
No wonder you were
punished so severely!
- Punished?
- Yes. Your Daddy thought...
you unfit to stay at home.
- So he sent you to a boarding.
- What nonsense, Bobby.
Don't listen to her, son.
She just blabbers.
Is this true?
- Why you haven't eaten any cake.
- Don't avoid the issue.
Was I sent to the boarding school
as a punishment?
Yes, son.
I tried my best to stop them.
But I was a servant after all.
Nobody listened to me.
Anyway, today you've become
such a smart boy.
Makes you happy, doesn't it?
Listen, won't you have tea?
What for?
You told me something I didn't know.
- Okay then, I'll go now.
- How long will you be in London?
It's a business trip, so I'll be
away for at least 2-3 weeks.
That reminds me, I've decided
to send Raja to zzzLondon too.
- What are you punishing me for now?
- Punishing you?
Yes.
I've heard that I was sent to the
Boarding School as a punishment.
- Who told you?
- Aunty Mrs Braganza.
- Is it a lie?
- So! You've begun...
to sit with the servants already.
She's not a servant, I look
up to her as a mother.
You didn't bring me up.
She did!
Hear that?
A bin!
Our books got exchanged.
Yes. My book has a cover just
like this one, you see.
My book, stupid.
Will you get lost now?
Only members are allowed here.
- Then make me a member too.
- People come here to study, not chat.
Then where does one go to chat?
- Outside the library.
- Then come on outside.
- Why did you flash a mirror?
- You weren't getting up, that's why.
- Do nice boys do such a thing?
- Am I a nice oy then?
- No, a very bad boy!
- Okay, let's do one thing.
Let's have some tea. I'm told,
hot tea, cools one down in summer.
No! We'll eat some
roasted gram first.
Won't you sit inside?
Gran says good girls don't sit
there when out on a first date.
- Why don't you say you're scared.
- What! You think I'm scared?
Look at these... my teeth?
How are they?
They're nice; which toothpaste
do you use?
Dummy! They're sharp.
They can cut a raw guava
in half, in one bite!
- So?
- See these nails?
They're very pointed.
- So?
- Times have changed Dummy!
I'm a girl of the 21st Century.
- But it's still the 20th!
- That's history. I'm from the 21st!
I know how to defend myself.
Nobody can touch me!
- Why not?
- Let him just try it!
Oh! Where did she drop here from?
Let go of my hand!
Hadn't you said something
about biting a cheek...
What! I said something about
biting a cheek?
Softly...
Hadn't you told me I was punished
for having bitten a woman's cheek?
- That's her out there.
- Really? I want to see her...
Have pity on your Dummy.
If she sees me with you...
...I'll be punished for
the rest of my life too!
Go away! Go on.
- Lift your legs.
- What!
My goodness!
Why should I lift my legs up?
I'm not scared. I'm leaving!
Listen...
Listen to me Bobby.
You! Mr Nath's son?
- Who was that girl?
- Which girl?
- The one that left just now.
- Can't recall.
Just went up.
- Towards the beach.
- She's...
Go and enjoy yourself then.
Go on...
- Well, see how I fooled you?
- You're great Bobby.
- I've never seen a girl like you.
- How many girls do you know then?
Me? Hundreds of them.
Well, if not hundreds, I know
at least a dozen very well.
Actually... I know just one.
You, Bobby.
You, and here?
Why did you run away while playing?
Because you saw me?
Shall I tell you the truth,
or make some excuse?
- Those who lie are bitten by a crow.
- Then I better tell you the truth!
Do you know why I ran away
from the badminton court?
Why?
I got nervous when I saw you.
This heart...
It is on the left side, isn't it?
I felt as though it had come
in my throat.
I got very scared.
But why did you get scared?
I don't know.
Think, and tell me.
We're being watched.
"I want to say something.
- So do l"
"I want to tell you something.
- So do l"
"You first
- No, you first"
"You, you, you, you...
- You, you, you you..."
"Look, just like those two men,
who, by saying..."
"you first", "no, you first"
had missed the train..."
"like that, we too may miss
this beautiful season"
"Okay, I'll say it"
"Like any other girl
in this situation..."
"would say to a boy
at the age of 16..."
"That's what I want
to say to you"
"Like any other boy
in this situation..."
"would say to a girl
of 16..."
"that's what I want to
say to you"
"I can't sleep,
nor is my heart at peace..."
"I wait for you...
I simply wait for you"
"Nothing seems nice
without you..."
"It all seems so false...
so untrue"
"I don't feel at ease at home,
nor out anywhere"
"I'm sitting at one place,
and lost somewhere else"
"But not to say anything and
just keep silent... No! No!"
"It's so difficult now
to keep silent"
"I've to tell you something.
- So do I..."
"I've nothing to do
the whole day..."
"but to think of you,
or to call out to you"
"All the colours in this world
seem so dull"
"Only your words sound so sweet"
"I live, so I can adore you"
"I live only for your consent"
"But not to say anything and
just keep quiet... No! No!"
"It's difficult now
to keep silent"
"I want to say something...
- So do l"
"Where there are no thorns..."
"let's go and stay there"
"Where there is no fear
for us to meet"
"Where there's no home for me,
but you, my beloved"
"Is there such a place
on this earth?"
"Let's leave the matter here,
and now..."
"but not to say anything now,
and keep quiet... No! No!"
"It's difficult now
to keep silent anymore"
"Like any other girl
in such situation..."
"would say to a boy
at the age of 16..."
"Say to him...
- That's what I wish to say"
"When a girl...
- When a boy..."
"Like any other girl...
- In such a situation"
Look, the boss is here.
He's a workaholic.
Else, where's the need to?
I've got first class fish.
Make good money.
Right, Boss.
Boss, my foot! I'm Jack.
You dare forget it!
Shall I keep this in Papa's room?
- What are you thinking about?
- I feeling very uneasy.
- What about? Papa won't refuse.
- I don't mean Jack.
- Then?
- I meant Mr Nath.
He's a rich man, dear.
Don't know whether he'll approve
of you and Raja mixing like this.
Oh Gran! Why should he mind?
Nonsense.
- Bobby's going to Kashmir, eh?
- No, she doesn't want to go.
- Why not?
- She doesn't want to.
Okay, but what's all this then?
- Raja is coming to pick her up.
- Which Raja?
Mr Nath's son.
He's taking her to a movie.
He is coming to take
permission of you.
That wee thing has become big
enough to date my Bobby?
- You don't mind, do you?
- Does he want permission, or you?
- I've pressed your suit for you.
- Suit? What for?
What's the occasion?
You know I wear a suit only twice.
For weddings and funerals. Why now?
You'll look very nice, won't you,
wearing that in Raja's presence!
I see.
He's a rich man's son, eh?
Can't wear this in front of him, eh?
These are my working clothes.
I work, so I earn and keep
the hearth burning!
He'll feel ashamed to see me
in these clothes, eh?
And you'll go to a movie
with my permission? No!
I told you I won't come.
Don't worry.
Your dad's away.
If I go away too, you'll be
all alone and get bored here.
- Come with me.
- No, Mom.
You go. I'll prepare for college.
I was coming to see you,
and you're running away?
I've some important work.
Promise. You'll come and
I'll let you go.
- What's the occasion?
- A party.
You'll come, won't you?
- Yes he will.
- Oh, Mom...
Master Raja?
Come in. Sit down.
Bobby, Master Raja's here.
- He's here, Jack.
- I heard.
This is Master Raja.
Get a glass, Mom.
Want to say something to me?
- Well... I want to see a movie.
- Go ahead.
- Well I... Aunty...
- Talking to her, or me?
I'm talking to you, sir.
If you allow me to...
...I'd like... Aunty... I'd like
to take Aunty to the movies!
You'll take my Mom out
to the movies?
No sir.
What I meant was...
I'd like to take Bobby out.
If you permit me, of course.
- No, you may not!
- Why not papa.
Because if he takes you out,
he'll show you a movie, dine out.
Spend money. Right?
That's why I'm against it.
Understand?
If you want to date her...
you'll go Dutch.
- That's not necessary, son.
- It is, Mom.
Look Mom, you worked
in his house. Fine.
But I didn't. If he's rich, fine.
I've my place too.
I've collected enough money
for my daughter's happiness.
- Why discuss all this?
- No need.
Give us a kiss, dear.
You'll both share the cost.
Accounts must be clear.
See that he doesn't cheat you.
Understand?
- I can read.
- So?
So, we go back home.
I've taken your Dada's permission.
Do we go back without enjoying?
- What do you mean?
- Sit. We'll go to a party.
- I'm finding this all weird.
- Aren't you a 21st century girl?
This is common in a party.
- Come, let's dance.
- No...
We'll meet again then.
- Didn't recognise me?
- No.
I'm Chanda. Your B-day party...
You're looking all lost.
Looking for Neema?
- Yes, can't see her.
- Must be around here.
Where were you all this time?
I was waiting so eagerly for you.
Where did you pick up such
a lovely girl?
She's Bobby.
- Who asked her name?
- I told you myself.
Anyway... I can't bear to see you
with somebody else tonight.
Come.
Standing all alone at
this beautiful moment?
Great style, beloved!
- One coke...
- Why not champagne?
Shut up! Be polite.
Polite, eh? It's an insult if one
doesn't tease a beautiful girl.
But I'm not impolite either.
- Looking out for Raja?
- Do you know him?
Very well. We were together
in the hostel. One scotch, please.
I used to lure many girls...
And him! Old Scrooge! Miser!
But how much has he given you?
I can offer you much more.
Will you come with me tonight?
You dare do this?
- Let go! I'm not of that sort.
- If not, then why are you here?
- Didn't he tell you before?
- He didn't know it himself!
He knows everything. One comes here
with one, and leaves with another.
- See how he entered her bedroom?
- He's not like that.
Come and see.
I'm up to my gills in love.
And...
And I don't want to come out.
I want to sink deeper in it.
I'm telling you the truth.
I want to marry.
Why bring marriage into this?
It's all nonsense.
And I'm much older than you.
How can you marry me?
But yes, we could be lovers.
You're mistaken, I meant Bobby.
I love her very much.
I want to marry her.
How dare you behave so cheaply
with an innocent girl like that?
What I do is cheap and when you
take him to your room is morality!
- You're back, my dear?
- Yes, Gran.
So soon? It was well, wasn't it?
Yes, Gran.
It was just fine.
Didn't you go to leave Bobby
at the station?
- To Leave Bobby?
- Yes, she's gone to Kashmir.
But she had said she won't
be going.
I don't know.
Last night she said...
she wanted to go.
The train leaves at noon.
- How will you reach the station?
- I'll reach.
Be careful, son.
You may fall.
Don't be angry with me.
It wasn't my fault. Please...
Listen to me.
Tell me, what's the matter?
At least tell me what I've done!
You've played with my feelings.
You're rich...
For you love may be a game,
But I wasn't from your lot.
Why did you do this?
Why?
Don't touch me!
Let go of my hand!
Let go of my hand, I say!
- What happened, dear?
- Nothing...
He has teased her!
She was yelling "Let me go!"
Eve-teaser, eh?
Shameless being!
You manhandle a guest?
Rascal! Cad! Tease a girl?
You cur!
How did you come here?
Shameless rascal! Cur!
Don't ever come here. Get lost!

- Madam, this horse is frisky.
- Then I won't ride it!
This horse is very temperamental.
If you're a good...
I know!
Bobby!
Stop, Bobby.
Stop!
- I want to die.
- Open your eyes... you're okay?
I don't want to live.
I don't wish to come in your way.
You are my way, and,
my destination too!
Liar!
If I hadn't seen with my own eyes,
I'd have still fell for this line.
I'd have believed you've never
expressed your love to anybody else.
- But don't you want to marry Neema?
- Enough!
I respect her. I was talking
to her about marrying you!
But not anymore. You believed
what you saw, but...
Did you think what would've
happened to me, had you died?
I'd have just committed suicide,
what else?
Forgive me, Raju.
- What's this, Raju?
- Say that again.
Nobody has called me
'Raju' before.
I'll call you 'Raju'
Always...
Nothing serious. Just
knocked out. Please help me.
- She's lucky to be saved.
- It was a 1,000 feet drop!
Just superficial abrasions.
- She's still out cold however!
- Lucky that he was there, else...
He's valiant, no doubt.
What a man!
My pony refused to bolt! Else,
wouldn't he have saved me too?
Had he saved me,
I'd have... just died!
- What are you talking about?
- You! you've really obliged us.
Not at all...
It was my duty.
- Where am I?
- Don't panic.
You're in your bed. Hale and hearty.
- Who are you?
- He only saved your life.
Endangering his own.
How can I ever thank you, Mr...
Raj Nath.
Pet name, Raju.
- Let me see you out.
- Why do you bother?
No bother.
- Trying to be a hero to them, eh?
- You're unnecessarily...
- What am I worth?
- Worthless!
- I'll show you tomorrow.
- What time?
- It's 12 O' clock.
- What?
Didn't you just ask the time?
That girl over there in red.
One in the centre.
With long hair.
Go give her this chit.
Bobby, see what I bought.
- Your letter, Miss.
- What?
Listen everyone, come here.
See what this says.
"Meeting like this is futile. Dump
these girls and come to the club".
This is the same boy
who saved you yesterday.
No, can't be him.
It's written right here.
"Yours, and only yours, Raju".
He was a gentleman yesterday,
and being Romeo today, eh?
- Such guys should be thrashed.
- Come, let's give him a hiding!
- Forget it! Why bother?
- What do you mean?
- Come alone, eh? Sure I will!
- Let's beat him up. You too Bobby.
No, I can't bear to see
thrashings. You all go.
Coward!
- Come girls, let's go
- Yes, come on.
There he is!
Wait, you scoundrel!
I'll show you yet.
- You!
- If you want to live, let's run!
- Must be here somewhere.
- Yes. He has lured Bobby at last.
Where will he go? He'll forget
his madness once we catch him.
- There's nobody here.
- She's innocent.
- We must protect her.
- Yes, let's go find them.
- What's the matter, girls?
- A cad has kidnapped a girl.
- Here? No...
- He came here.
- I saw with my own eyes.
- Nonsense! I'm a watchman here.
Now go along. Don't pester me.
I've to lock up now.
What are you peering in for?
I've to go to the market.
It takes me 3 hours, to and fro.
It'll be late when I return. Go...
The watchman said it'll take
Oh God! I think I'll die.
- What will I tell my teacher?
- Your friends will tell her that!
Don't tease me.
Think how to get out of here.
All the doors and
windows are locked!
What are you laughing about?
Think of something.
- That's what I'm doing.
- What?
"Nobody can come in...
from the outside"
"Nobody can go out...
from the inside"
"Think what would happen
in such a situation"
"You and I..."
"Both locked in a room"
"And the key gets lost"
"Then I too will get lost
in the charm of your eyes"
"You and I...
both locked in a room..."
"and the key gets lost"
"It's pitch dark ahead...
- I'm very scared"
"With a robber behind you!
- Why are you scaring me?"
"Darkness ahead"
"And a robber behind you"
"You can't climb up..."
"nor can you climb down"
"Think what would happen
in this really happened"
"You and I..."
"are going somewhere"
"And we lose our way"
"In your loving arms, my love"
"I'll swing to and fro"
"You and I...
Iocked up in a room"
"And the key gets lost"
"Far away from the madding crowd,
behind the mountains"
"Lost in each other
under thick trees..."
"A place unseen and
unknown to anyone"
"Just you and I, and
the breeze for company"
"Think what it'll be like
if this happens"
"You and I..."
"are passing through a forest"
"and encounter a tiger"
"I'll ask it to spare you..."
"and devour me instead"
"You and I...
Iocked up in a room"
"And the key gets lost"
"Why are you so lost?"
"Why pretend to be asleep,
when awake?"
"Who knows what will
happen tomorrow"
"That's worrying me a bit"
"Think, what if something happens"
"You and I..."
"we're frolicking around"
"and suddenly our eyes
are filled with tears"
"I swear on your head..."
"I'll just drop dead"
"You and I...
Iocked up in a room"
"And the key gets lost"
"Then I too will lose myself
in the charm of your eyes"
"You and I..."
"both locked up in a room"
"And the key gets lost"
"And the key...
- gets lost"
- Has Raja returned?
- I was going to ask you that.
Had he told me before going,
to inform me of his arrival?
You talk as though I asked him
to go with that girl!
Of course not. You're not at fault.
You were busy with your social life.
How will you know
what your son is up to?
Ask yourself that!
He's been here for quite some
time. Have you ever sat with him?
Why him? Have you had the time to
sit with your wife for 20 minutes?
What do you mean? Do I neglect
my business and follow you around?
No. Neglect your family
and make money.
Whom do I earn it for?
You and Raja...
Don't take his name! Have you ever
given him love?
As if you have!
Thanks to you! You sent him away.
When he came back he was grown up!
Yes! He didn't miss anything
by not being hugged by you!
Neither he missed it,
nor did you lose anything.
Only I felt childless.
Brought flowers from Kashmir, eh?
Yes, the season was loverly.
Spring! Full of flowers.
- But we're ablaze here!
- It's hot, but I see no fire...
You don't, but
I'm feeling the heat.
I don't understand.
I'm ashamed to say it.
One doesn't know when my son...
and that slut-of a-daughter
of a servant...
But Bobby's not a slut.
No doubt. Aunty was my governess...
But everybody has a lean period.
Today they're well settled in life.
Who all will I tell this to?
Everyone knows she was our servant.
Was! Today they have servants.
Mr. Braganza has some status today.
What does he do for a living?
And Dad, Bobby is a good and
a decent girl. If you meet her...
Can you call them over?
Invite them for dinner tomorrow.
I don't want to delay this issue.
Will you have dinner with us?
My father wants to meet you.
Why?
- To see Bobby.
- What for?
I'll come. For my daughter's sake,
I can bow at anyone's door...
- But I won't kneel! Know why?
- Why?
"I don't want any gold or silver;
I seek not diamonds and pearls"
"Of what use are
they for me?"
"I won't ask for a bungalow, nor
a carriage driven by horses"
"They're all just
for name sake"
"Instead, give me your heart
in exchange for mine"
"So take it...
it's all yours, sir"
"There's no bargaining
in love"
"I don't know about maulvi or kazi,
or even Mecca or Varanasi..."
"I'm just thirsting for love"
"Dear Queen of my dreams...
you'll be thunder-struck to know"
"that I'm just mad about you"
"So will you swap hearts
with me?"
"Go on, give me your heart
in hange for mine"
"Take it, sir...
It's all yours"
"No bargaining with love"
"If you lie, a crow will peck you.
So beware!"
"I'll go to my mother's
while you stand and watch"
"You're lying!
So a black crow will peck you"
"Beware now...
I'll go to my mother's..."
"right under your nose!
I'll go to my mother's..."
"while you just stand and gape"
"If you go to your mother's,
I'll pick up a stick"
"I'll come with a stick"
"If you come with a stick,
I'll jump in the well"
"I'll pull you up with a rope"
"Then I'll climb up a tree"
"I'll cut it down
with a saw"
"Will he love me, or use a saw?
Better beware of such a lover..."
"I'll go to my mother's!
Just you watch!"
"You lie and be pecked by a crow.
But beware!"
"I'll go to my mother's...
right under your nose"
"I'll go to my mom,
just you wait!"
"If you go to your Mom's..."
"I'll get married again
to some other woman"
"You'll marry another girl?
Get a rival for me?"
"Then I won't go to my mother's..."
"I'll stick to you...
I won't go to my mother's"
"I'll keep all my promises,
but I won't leave you..."
"Honestly, I won't go
to my mother's now"
"Remember, you lie and the
black crow will peck you"
"Beware!
I'll get you a rival"
"And you can't do anything!
I'll marry again, just you wait"
"Liar! And may the crow peck you.
So beware!"
"I won't go to my mother's..."
Welcome, sir.
Come in, Aunty.
How about some whisky?
I don't drink whisky.
I prefer Rum.
And I've a permit for it too;
shall I show you?
Serve him Rum. Come, sir.
Have a seat.
So how's your fishing business?
First class.
There's lot of money in fish, sir.
And there's lot of fish
in the sea too, Ma'am.
- Where do you export your fish?
- What export?
What she means is which
countries does your fish go to?
What are you saying, sir?
I sweat all day and atch fish.
I can't supply this city,
how can I export it?
Shall I tell you something?
If we sell a fish for Re. 1...
when it comes on your table, it
costs Rs.8. Middlemen make profit.
But don't worry, I'll give you a
basket full, of fresh fish, daily.
Raja, won't you show
your room to Bobby?
They make such a lovely pair.
How happy the kids look!
Yes, they're kids.
...Your rum.
Water, or Soda?
I'm a fisherman; I take it neat.
Dilution weakens it. Fill it up.
Till I take my full quota,
I can't think properly.
My father can't talk with style.
I hope your father understands.
I understand only too well,
what you're after.
I'm a God-fearing man, sir.
I really tell you.
I only want my daughter's happiness.
God has given me everything.
- She's my only daughter.
- Raja's my only son too.
There's nothing more valuable
than his happiness, for me too.
He's naive. Doesn't realise that
what seems joy is in fact danger!
Actually you dreamt a lofty dream.
I'm sorry, that it won't
come true however.
You see where you live,
and the way you live.
Just think where you are,
and where we stand.
How did you think that your
daughter will come here as...
What did you say?
- I planned all this? Me?
- Isn't it possible...
that your mother could've thought
of this when she worked here?
That one day Raja will grow
up and so will your daughter.
Yes! He's my heir to all
my wealth. But still a kid.
A stupid bird sees the grain,
but not the trap!
And with the kind of
beautiful trap you've laid...
Hold on.
Cherish this.
I'll think that my love is safe.
We'll not stay here a minute
longer. Come, mother.
- I'll never forget this meeting.
- I'll leave them to the taxi-stand.
Your Daddy's rum is not strong...
enough to make me lose my way.
I had told you, for the sake
of Bobby's happiness...
I'll bow at anybody's door,
but I'll not kneel!
How come a richie-rich bothered
to come to my humble hut?
Last night you got angry and
returned home. Later I realised...
my way of saying things was wrong.
- Let alone ways, sir.
What you said was wrong.
I owe you yesterday's rum.
I don't drink in the mornings.
And I drink 24 hours, sir.
You big-wigs keep a schedule.
If you have anything worthwhile
to say, carry on.
Indeed! It is worthwile for you.
I've come to ask you,
how much money do you want?
How much money do I want?
What did you say?
- I didn't hear you properly.
- You heard me alright.
You are an excellent angler!
You net good fish!
And this time,
my son has been caught in it.
I don't wish you
to undergo any loss!
Tell me, what's your
price to set my son free?
Rs.20,000, Rs.50,000.
You brought a cheque-book?!
You wait.
Hold on, man.
I'll show you.
Comes with a cheque-book!
Dangles money at me!
You think only you have money?
Even I have it. Look!
You rich have just money,
cars, bungalows...
You've just wealth,
but not hearts.
And we poor, have honour,
hearts, and happiness.
And we don't sell these
things, understand?
You don't sell, but make
business out of it!
People with honour don't turn
their daughters into bales of hay...
and offer them to sons
of millionaires. Get me?
Had Mr. Nath come?
Go inside, dear.
Why are you just standing?
Tell me. Why was he here?
Why?
To tell me that...
you're a whore.
And that I'm a bastard...
That I force my daughter
to sell herself.
Do you know why that friend is
trampling our prestige like this?
Because you fed his son!
Raju had given me this.
I'll drown you if
you take his name!
I'll pack off both of you.
Go to Goa at once.
- Why?
- If you speak...
I'll have your tongue!
I don't want that boy to
come here and meet my baby.
Off you go!
- How dare you come here!
- I've come for Bobby.
I don't want to hear her name
on your lips, do you hear?
She's dead to you!
I beg of you...
Before I do something to you...
Please go from here.
You've made life one big hell
for my daughter.
She'll never laugh again. You've made
a living corpse out of her.
"My heart broke..."
"into a thousand pieces..."
"in my heart"
"Let me hug you and die"
"What's the point in living"
"Let our eyes see
each other, at least"
"Let our eyes be
in each other's view"
"So that even from afar..."
"we can quench our
thirst for each other"
"Let us be close enough
to see each other"
"So that even from a distance
our thirst can be quenched"
"So let our eyes at least
see each other"
Where had you been?
I asked "where had you been?"
- You know where I had been.
- Why?
- Answer me! Why?
- You know why.
- That's no answer.
- Okay. I had gone to meet Bobby.
I can't live without her.
I... I love her.
Love, my foot!
You're not old enough for love.
Do you know what love is,
and who is worthy of it?
First you brought scum here and
now I'll just stand and watch?
Hear me good, son. The prestige
of this house is no toy.
This is my house. One who doesn't
obey me has no right to stay here.
Where are you going?
Sir, I had wrongly thought
this was my home too.
What childishness is this?
Where will you go?
Can't I be a shoe-shine boy,
or work as a labourer?
Let him go, dear.
He'll be back in two days.
He doesn't know about those boys
who become old men straight away.
- Who don't know what's youth!
- If that's my destiny, so be it.
Even if I've to starve. At least
I'll be with the one I love.
So you're seeing that mirage, eh?
Even the law doesn't permit
you to do this.
Because you're still a minor.
If you marry, you'll land in jail.
Your father's right, son.
Become 21 years old...
and then do what you like.
- He has begun to talk back!
- You also scold him like a kid.
- Why don't you convince him?
- What do today's kids think we are?
Do today's parents understand
their kids?
Meaning?
Just that modern kids want
to see, with open eyes.
It's not necessary that their view
should match their parents view.
A 19 year old boy
isn't a kid, Mr. Nath.
It's just 2 years. I'll be 21,
and you'll be 19 years old.
Then no power on earth can stop us.
The law, or our parents.
Never mind. I've found a way.
I'll get Raja married.
- Without asking him?
- Will he agree if I ask him?
Thanks to Ms. Pestonji we've got
a decent proposal from Mr. Sharma.
Welcome, sir.
We were just talking about you.
Yes Bobby, we'll have a
sweet home after we marry.
I promise I'll give you
the house of your dreams.
Since our children will wed soon,
this house is ine and vice versa.
Now that you both are related,
how about sealing it with a hug?
I'm having a New Year Party
and you're all invited.
We'll have a drink together, and
the boy and the girl can meet too.
We'll never keep our kids away
from us. We'll love them a lot.
Without love, kids become
very insecure, Bobby.
There's a difference in dreams
and reality, Raj.
What?
Of what use is such innocence?
That you can't even hear
your dream being shattered?
This is not the
House of Your Dreams.
Run away, Raj...
Run away from them all!
Anything special?
No, the usual.
Music, dance, drinks etc.
But for us it'll certainly be special.
We'll start the year on a new note.
Looks as though he has invited
the whole who's who! Come!
Look, they've come.
- Our future son-in-law...
- How he has grown!
- Yes?
- Introduce Raja to my daughter.
Look after your special guest.
This is Raja.
You took so long to come.
Made me wait so much...
I didn't recognise you.
No?
You didn't recognise me?
I'm Alka...
So, you're Mr. Sharma's daughter.
Yes, I'm the one.
This house is mine. Nice, eh?
My daddy built this house
just for me. Only me.
I'm his only child, so I'll be
inheriting all this one day.
That's why everybody
loves me so very much.
Everybody calls me by my pet name,
Nicky. You also call me Nicky.
I prefer Alka.
I'll tell everybody now
to call me Alka, Okay?
- Your doll's very nice.
- Yes, isn't she?
I've a room full of dolls.
Come, I'll show you.
I know I've grown up
and become tall too.
But mentally, I'm still a kid.
So what? The doctor said
when I get married...
everything will be fine.
- You will marry me, won't you?
- Me? Marry you?
You will, won't you?
You're not like the others.
You will marry me?
- Who told you this?
- My Dad. Your Dad.
My Dad said he'd give your Dad
a whole lot of business.
And they'll send us abroad
for our honeymoon.
My dad's wealth is all mine and
then yours after marriage.
You will marry me?
My dream will come true?
I will become a bride, won't I?
I will be a bride...
What's this? You asked me to wait
till I was 21. Why am I cheated?
I didn't do anything. This proposal
was good so your father decided.
This is my life. Who are you
to take decisions about it?
Your father! The decision is final.
It's for your own good and progress.
You've sold me for money,
by making this deal.
Learn to be polite, son.
No use arguing about it now.
Mr. Sharma is going to make it
official tomorrow.
"Trapped"
"He who has left home,
has no roof over his head..."
"and made a home
in someone else's heart"
"He's now trapped!"
"This one year between
boyhood and manhood..."
"is very traumatic.
This one year..."
"of youth, of innocence,
and madness"
"This one year between boyhood
and manhood is ad"
"The good name of the lover
is tarred"
"And the world laughed"
"He's trapped"
"One who has no home
or a roof over his head..."
"and instead made a home
in someone else's heart..."
"is totally trapped"
"Better that today itself
with a cage and all..."
"the bird flies away.
It might save his life"
"Through some opening...
by seeking a proper chance"
"Even by deceit...
better today..."
"that the bird flies off
with the cage and all..."
"Life has become unbearable"
"because somebody has bitten
through and through..."
"See... he's trapped!"
"He who has left home
has no roof over his head..."
"and made a home in
someone's heart"
"Is trapped"
You're responsible for this.
I told you to take his consent.
I did say he can't be forced.
He ran away! My son has gone.
Look, if I find my son
with your daughter...
I won't spare you.
I'll finish you!
Don't threaten me, man.
If you have the guts, do it.
Go find your son. Must be playing
around with some innocent girl.
Else, must be lying in a gutter!
- Who do you want?
- Does Aunty live here?
Who?
She's inside
Master Raja?
I've left everything
behind, Aunty. Forever and ever.
You've come without your
anyone's permission?
Whose permission would I have taken?
A mom who never had time for me.
Who doesn't and never will.
That father, who never loved me?
I've left that home.
You've come.
I always knew you'd come.
Stop right there, girl.
I won't let you meet him.
- But why?
- Because you ran away from home.
You've done wrong.
What's right and what isn't, Aunty?
Was my father right?
He was selling me. Selling!
He was getting me married to a
mentally handicapped girl for money.
Is he's right?
Must've thought of a good future.
I've also thought about my life.
Who's he to finalise my marriage?
- The law has given him the right.
- What law?
It's my life and someone
else decides about it?
Don't stop us, Gran.
He has left his home far behind.
Hasn't he come for me?
- I order you. Go upstairs!
- No, Gran, no!
I've listened to you before,
but I'll not obey you now.
- Take her up and lock her!
- What are you doing, Gran?
The right thing. When the time
will prove that ou were wrong...
you both will say,
"Why didn't you stop us...
- when there was still time?
- No! Who are you to stop me?
What do you want?
Haven't we suffered enough?
Do you know how your father
has insulted my son?
If he comes to know you're
here, he'll...
- Take her up and lock her.
- I'll die, Gran.
I can't stay without him.
Please Gran...
I'll die without him.
Release Bobby.
Don't be so cruel to her.
You know how much we love each other.
We're not committing any sin.
- We want to get married.
- You can't! You're under age.
Do you know what can happen.
Jack can be jailed.
I can be jailed and,
Bobby will become homeless.
- Her life can be ruined.
- No, no...
Not when I'm alive.
I've come with great hopes.
I've looked to you as a mother.
And thought you'd give me shelter.
Only you love me, Aunty.
Because I love you, I'm stopping
you from committing a mistake.
- Till I come back, sit over there.
- Where are you going?
To wire your father
to take you home!
No!
That's betrayal! Don't do this.
Why are you doing this?
Wait! Don't do this.
Don't go, Wait!
Listen to me. Don't go.
don't do this. Wait!
Don't lie! You sent Raja to Goa
and now show an empty house.
You! You're back again?
Got the police with you
to scare me, eh?
I told you to go and seek
your son in some gutter!
No need to do that.
He's lying in a dirty gutter
at your place in Goa.
Your mother has sent this wire.
Raja is at your home.
You told me your daughter's in Goa.
You didn't tell me...
...you've sent Raja
with her to flirt around.
Mind your tongue.
This is a clever move from you.
It costs just Rs.2/-.
It can be sent from anywhere.
Hadn't I told you that if I find
my son with your daughter...
then I'll chop her to pieces!
I'll chop her up and throw her!
Else, I'll send you to the jail.
Inspector, you wait here.
You come with me to Goa now.
You insult us poor, Mr. Nath.
I swear by Jesus.
If I find your son
with my daughter...
then I'll mince her.
Else, I'll send you to jail.
Come to Goa with me.
Inspector, I'll be right back.
- Yes, Gran?
- It's very late.
- Go to sleep now.
- Okay, Gran.
Why did you risk your life?
What if you had slipped?
Better I die than live without you.
If you can't stay without me...
- Neither can I.
- I know.
But what can we do? Tomorrow
your Dad will take you away.
- And, we'll be separated...
- Never!
No way!
But we can't afford
to give in either.
Look at me.
And answer me.
Will you be with me always?
In joy and sorrow,
good times and bad?
In death?
Will you be there with me?
- Always?
- Always Raju. Forever.
This is my house.
Search for that boy.
- You and here, son?
- Thanks to this richie-rich!
Ask Mr. Nath. He's accusing us
of a new crime now.
Says I've hidden his son here.
Look at this false telegram.
Says you sent it!
Tell him it's a hoax.
I sent the telegram, son.
Come, sir. Thank God you came.
Raja is in this room.
I didn't let those two meet.
I sat out here the whole night.
Raja's still a kid.
And kids do err. Forgive him.
Sorry, but nobody here.
Stop playing Blind man's Buff,
and tell us where Raja is!
Isn't he inside? He was there.
I've been out here all night.
Don't ham, Madam. I didn't
bring the police for nothing.
I can get you arrested
right this minute.
They've changed their spots now.
Can't demand money in your presence.
I've locked Bobby upstairs.
- Master Raja, could be...
- Give me the key.
Nath! Come and see this!
Go and see Inspector.
Now let me tell you something.
Your son has kidnapped
my 16-year old minor daughter.
Inspector, arrest him at once...
and ask where my daughter is!
- Don't blabber!
- I'm not blabbering.
Just warning you that Bobby
didn't go to your house.
Your son came here!
Let me tell you another thing.
If anything happens to my girl
your son...
will be personally chopped up
and fed to the dogs!
No, Jack! No!
Stop! Stop!
Get that paper with the message
that a boy has kidnapped a girl...
and check the motor-cycle number.
Are you Mr. Raj Nath?
No, it's Vishnu Rastogi.
- And are you Bobby Braganza?
- No. Her name is...
- Mrs. Vimla Rastogi.
- Correct.
- Where's the paper?
- Under that drawer.
Did you see a yellow
motor-cycle carrying my Bobby...
I mean a girl and a boy go this way?
- Yes, how did you know?
- Got the news from the Police H.Q.
Brave girl!
Don't worry. All will be well.
Thirsty? Hungry?
Come on.
This is done by your son to stop us
from chasing him further.
Look over there.
Your photograph.
Why your photograph in the papers?
Boss, saw this photograph?
Dad has given an ad. that whoever
finds us will get Rs.25,000!
- 25,000/-.
- Let's go, Bobby.
I'm Prem.
Prem Chopra!
Very glad to have met you.
Your paper, Sir. Come Bobby.
- Will you drop us at the next stop?
- Okay, get in.
Aren't you getting late?
Roll the truck. Come on!
This is your snap, isn't it?
See? It's him.
- The girl's not bad either.
- The boy's worth Rs.25,000/-!
You're bullying these two?
Lock horns with me.
Where do you want to go?
I'll take you in my vehicle.
- Much obliged.
- It's my duty.
No obligations. Come.
It's not a sedan, but a small tempo.
But you can try it out. Come.
See this photograph.
They've come again...
Don't worry.
We'll reach you safely.
Prem... Prem Chopra is my name.
Let me go!
Let me go!
No...! Stop it!
How has he harmed you?
- Leave him alone!
- Shall I?
If I leave him, he'll run.
and with him that reward too!
So why not break his legs?
Break his leg, eh? Bastard!
I'll beat you to pulp!
Fatso! You've come to share
the reward eh? Catch him.
Talk of money! You rascal.
Don't you know they're my kids?
Whoever you are, fatso,
you seem to be their friend.
But remember,
if you act too smart...
this knife will go through him!
- No!
You can skin me alive.
But don't harm him. Let him go.
Catch him, and skin him alive.
Help! Help!
Beat me as much as you like.
But don't do anything
to that boy.
Don't harm him...
- Catch the hooligans!
- Stop! Don't come any further.
Come Bobby, let's run.
Daddy's here to separate us.
He won't let us live together.
But nobody can separate us now.
Nobody!
Hadn't you said...
You'll be with me in joy,
sorrow, life and even death?
- Yes.
- Come with me.
Raja! Bobby!
Stop!
Raja, don't go further,
please, son.
- Don't go further. There's danger.
- There's danger ahead and behind too.
- Why be scared of it?
- If you take one more step...
you'll die.
- If we return, will you let us be?
- How childish?
This is not childishness.
It's love.
But unfortunately you didn't realise
your son has his life, his own sense.
They know what's good and bad.
You think we are child.
Come back, son.
To their parents, kids always
remain kids, son.
Who's denying it? But I'm not
a piece of your property.
Your society and law think that
our lives belong to you.
Okay, Our lives may be...
But not our death!
No...
How do I convince you now?
Come back, Both of you.
We weren't meant to live together.
But we can die together,
can't we?
Your son is alive.
Thank God! My daughter's alive too.
My daughter!
- Papa!
- Yes, my dear.
My dear, when we nearly
lost you both today...
I realised how invaluable
kids are to their parents.
