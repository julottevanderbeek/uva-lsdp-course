Hey, Ralph. Congratulations.
Congratulations.
- Bye-bye. See you.
- Congratulations.
Well, I guess
we really did it, huh?
I don't think there's any
doubt about that.
You and Betty have been
almost inseparable since
you met in Dr. Scott's
refresher courses.
To tell you the truth, Brad, that was the
only reason I showed up in the first place.
-
-  I mean...
Okay, you guys, this is it!
You ready?
Looks like Betty's gonna throw her bouquet.
Ready?
Okay, here it comes!
I got it!
- I got it!
- Hey, big fella.
Looks like it could be your turn next, hey?
Who knows?
So long. See you, Brad.
We'd better get going now, Betty.
- Good-bye, Betty!
- Bye! Bye!
See you, Brad.
Bye, Betty!
Oh, Brad, wasn't it wonderful?
Didn't Betty look radiantly beautiful?
Oh, I can't believe it. An hour ago,
she was plain old Betty Munroe.
And now...
Now she's Mrs. Ralph Hapschatt.
- Yes, Janet. Ralph's a lucky guy.
- Yes.
Oh, I always cry at weddings.
- Uh, everyone knows that Betty's
a wonderful little cook. - Yes.
Why, Ralph himself... he'll be in line
for a promotion in a year or two.
Yes.
- Hey, Janet.
- Yes, Brad?
I've got something to say.
Uh-huh?
# I really loved the... #
# Skillful way #
# You beat the other girls #
# To the bride's bouquet #
Oh. Oh, Brad.
- # The river was deep, but I swam it #
-  #Janet #
- # The future is ours so let's plan it #
-
- # So please don't tell me to can it #
- # Janet #
# I've one thing to say
and that's dammit, Janet #
# I love you #
- # The road was long but I ran it #
- # Janet #
- # There's a fire in my heart
and you fan it # -
- # If there's one fool for you
then I am it # - # Janet #
# I've one thing to say
and that's dammit, Janet #
# I love you #
Whoo!
# Here's the ring to prove
that I'm no joker #
Oh!
# There's three ways that love
can grow #
- # That's good, bad #
-
- # Or mediocre #
- Oh.
# Oh, J-A-N-E-T #
- # I love you so #
- Oh!
- # Oh, it's nicer than Betty Munroe had #
-  # Oh, Brad #
- # Now we're engaged and I'm so glad #
- # Oh, Brad #
- # That you met Mom and you know Dad #
-
# I've one thing to say
and that's, Brad, I'm mad #
# For you too #
# Oh, Brad #
# Oh, dammit #
# I'm mad #
# Oh, Janet #
# For you #
# I love you too #
# There's one thing left to do
Ah-ooh #
- # And that's go see the man
who began it # -  # Janet #
- # When we met in his science exam, it #
- # Janet #
- # Made me give you the eye
and then panic # - # Janet #

# Dammit, Janet #

I would like, if I may,
to take you on a strange journey.
It seemed a fairly ordinary night...
when Brad Majors
and his fiancée, Janet Weiss...
two young, ordinary, healthy kids...
left Denton
that late November evening...
to visit a Dr. Everett Scott,
ex-tutor and now friend
to both of them.
It's true there were
dark storm clouds...
heavy, black and pendulous...
toward which they were driving.
It's true, also, that the spare tire
they were carrying...
was badly in need of some air.
But they, being normal kids
and on a night out,
well, they were not going to let a storm
spoil the events of their evening.
On a night out.
It was a night out
they were going to remember...
for a very long time.
I have never been
a quitter. ##
To leave office before my term
is completed...
is abhorrent
to every instinct in my body.
I must put the interests
of America first.
America needs
a full-time president...
- particularly at this time with
the problems... -
Gosh, that's the third motorcyclist
that's passed us.
They sure do take their lives in their
hands, what with the weather and all.
Yes, Janet.
Life's pretty cheap to that type.
...would almost totally absorb
the time and attention...
of both the president
and the Congress...
What's the matter, Brad, darling?
Hmm. We must have taken
the wrong fork a few miles back.
Oh. But then where did
that motorcyclist come from?
Hmm. Well, I guess
we'll just have to turn back.
...to continue to fight through the
months ahead for my...
What was that bang?
We must have a blowout.
Dammit! I knew I should've
gotten that spare tire fixed.
You just stay here and keep warm,
and I'll go for help.
Where will you go?
We're in the middle of nowhere.
...the great issues of peace abroad
and prosperity without inflation at home.
Didn't we pass a castle
back down the road a few miles?
...I shall resign...
-
- I'm going with you.
Oh, no, darling, there's no sense
in both of us getting wet.
I'm coming with you.
Besides, darling, the owner of that phone
might be a beautiful woman,
and you might never
come back again.
# In the velvet darkness #
# Of the blackest night #
# Burning bright #
# There's a guiding star #
# No matter what #
# Or #
# Who you are #
# There's a light #
# Over at the Frankenstein place #
# There's a light #
# Burning in the fireplace #
# There's a light #
# Light in the darkness #
# Of everybody's life #
# The darkness must go #
# Down the river #
# Of nights dreaming #
# Flow morphia slow #
# Let the sun #
# And light come streaming #
# Into my life #
# There's a light #
# Over at the Frankenstein place #
# Burning in the fireplace #
# In the darkness #
# Of everybody's life ##
it seemed that fortune
had smiled on Brad and Janet...
and that they had found the assistance
that their plight required.
Or had they?
Brad, let's go back.
I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Just a moment, Janet.
They may have a phone.
Hello.
Hi! My name's Brad Majors.
This is my fiancée,
Janet Weiss.
I wonder if you might help us. You see,
our car broke down a few miles up the road.
Do you have a phone
we might use?
You're wet.
- Yes, it's raining.
- Yes.
Yes.
I think, perhaps,
you better both come inside.
You're too kind.
##
Brad, I'm frightened.
What kind of a place is this?
Oh, it's probably some kind of
hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
Oh.
This way.
Are you having a party?
You've arrived
on a rather special night.
- It's one of the master's affairs.
- Oh.
- Lucky him.
- You're lucky.
He's lucky. I'm lucky.
We're all lucky!
# It's astounding #
# Time is fleeting #
# Madness takes its toll #
# But listen closely #
# Not for very much longer #
# I've got to keep control #
# I remember #
# Doing the time warp #

just having a think #

gave me an evil wink #

and I felt a change #

Say something.
Say!
- Do any of you guys know how to Madison?
-
-
- Huh? - Huh?
Brad, please,
let's get out of here.
For God's sake,
keep a grip on yourself, Janet.
-
- It's just a party, Janet.
- Well, I want to go. - Well, we can't
go anywhere till I get to a phone.
- Then ask the butler or someone.
-
We don't want to interfere
with their celebrations.
This isn't the Junior
Chamber of Commerce, Brad.
They're probably foreigners
with ways different than our own.
They may do some more...
folk dancing.
Look, I'm cold, I'm wet
and I'm just plain scared!
I'm here.
There's nothing to worry about.
# How do you do, I #
# See you've met my #
# Faithful handyman #
# He's just a little brought down
because #
# When you knocked #
# He thought you were
the candy man #
# Don't get strung out #
# By the way I look #
# Don't judge a book by its cover #
# By the light of day #
# But by night
I'm one hell of a lover #
# I'm just a sweet transvestite #
# From Transsexual #
# Transylvania #
# Let me show you around #
# Maybe play you a sound #
# You look like you're both
pretty groovy #
# Or if you want something visual #
# That's not too abysmal #
# We could take in an old
Steve Reeves movie #
# I'm glad we
caught you at home #
# Could we use your phone #
- # We're both in a bit of a hurry #
- Right.
# We'll just say where we are #
# Then go back to the car #
A pleasure to meet you, Dr. Furter.
- # We don't want to be any worry #
-
# Well, you got caught with a flat #
# Well, how about that #
# Well, babies, don't you panic #
# By the light of the night #
# It'll all seem all right #
# I'll get you a satanic mechanic #
# I'm just a sweet transvestite #
# From Transsexual #
# Transylvania #
Ah, ha!
# Why don't you stay for the night #
- # Night #
- # Or maybe a bite #

# I'm just a sweet transvestite #

Ah, ha!
# So come up to the lab #
# I see you shiver with antici... #
# ...pation #
# But maybe the rain #
# Is really to blame #
# But not the symptom ##
Wonderful!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Oh! Oh!
Oh! Brad!
It's all right, Janet.
We'll play along for now
and pull out the aces
when the time's right.
Oh. Oh!
Oh. Slowly, slowly.
It's too nice a job to rush.
- Hi. My name's Brad Majors, and this is
my fiancée, Janet Weiss. -
Uh, you are...
You're very lucky to be invited
up to Frank's laboratory.
Some people would give
their right arm for the privilege.
- People like you maybe?
- Hah!
- I've seen it.
- Oh!
Uh-huh.
Come along. The master
doesn't like to be kept waiting.
Is he, um... Frank, I mean.
Is he your husband?
The master is not yet married.
Nor do I think he ever will be.
- We are simply his servants.
- Oh.
Magenta.
Columbia.
Go and assist Riff Raff.
I will entertain, um...
Brad Majors.
This is my fiancée, Janet Vice.
- Weiss.
- Weiss.
- Mmm!
-
Well, how nice.
And what charming underclothes
you both have.
But here, put these on.
They'll make you feel
less, uh, vulnerable.
It's not often
we receive visitors here,
let alone offer them hospitality.
Hospitality? All we wanted to do
was to use your telephone. Goddamn it!
A reasonable request
which you've chosen to ignore!
- Brad, don't be ungrateful.
- Ungrateful?
How forceful you are, Brad.
Such a perfect specimen
of manhood... so dominant.
You must be awfully
proud of him, Janet.
Well, yes, I am.
- Do you have any tattoos, Brad?
- Certainly not.
Oh, well.
- How about you?
-
Everything is in readiness, master.
We merely await your word.
- Tonight, my unconventional
conventionists... -
you are to witness a new breakthrough
in biochemical research.
And paradise is to be mine!
It was strange the way it happened.
Suddenly, you get a break.
All the pieces seem to fit into place.
What a sucker you've been.
What a fool.
The answer was there all the time.
It took a small accident
to make it happen.
- An accident!
-  Accident!
And that's how I discovered
the secret.
That elusive ingredient.
That spark...
that is the breath of life.
Yes.
I have that knowledge.
I hold the secret...
to life itself!
You see, you are fortunate.
For tonight is the night...
that my beautiful creature
is destined to be born!
Hoopla!
Throw open the switches
on the sonic oscillator.
And step up the reactor power input...
Oh, Brad!
It's all right, Janet.
Oh!
Oh, Rocky!

Sha-la-la ##
-  Mmm!
-
That's no way to behave
on your first day out.
But, um, since you're such
an exceptional beauty,
I'm prepared to forgive you.
Ooh!
Oh, I just love success!
- He's a credit to your genius, master.
- Yes.
- A triumph of your will.
- Yes.
He's okay.
"Okay"?
"Okay"?
I think we can do
better than that.
Come on.
Now, Brad and Janet,
what do you think of him?
Oh. Well,
I don't like men
with too many muscles.
- I didn't make him for you!
-
He carries the Charles Atlas
seal of approval.

# My hands kind of fumbled
with her white plastic belt #
# I'd taste her baby pink lipstick
and that's when I'd melt #
# She'd whisper in my ear
tonight she really was mine #

Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah!
Rocky, Rocky, rah, rah, rah!
There are those who say
that life is an illusion...
and that reality is simply
a figment of the imagination.
If this is so, then
Brad and Janet are quite safe.
However, the sudden departure
of their host...
and his creation...
into the seclusion
of his somber bridal suite...
had left them feeling
both apprehensive and uneasy.
A feeling which grew
as the other guests departed...
and they were shown
to their separate rooms.
Who is it? Who's there?
-  It's only me, Janet.
- Oh.
Brad, darling, come in.
- Mmm!
- Oh, Brad!
Yes, my darling!
Oh, but what if...
It's all right, Janet.
Everything's going to be all right.
Oh, I hope so, my darling.
- Oh! It's you!
-  I'm afraid so, Janet.
- But isn't it nice?
- Oh!
Oh, you beast! You monster!
What have you done with Brad?
Well, nothing.
Why, do you think I should?
You tricked me! I wouldn't have.
I've never, never...
-
- Yes. Yes, I know.
But it isn't all bad, is it?
I think you really will
find it quite pleasurable.
- So soft, so sensual.
- Stop. I mean, help!
- Oh, Brad. Oh, Brad!
- Shh.
Brad's probably asleep by now.
Do you want him to see you
like this?
Oh! Like this? Like how?
It's your fault! You're to blame!
I was saving myself.
Well, I'm sure
you're not spent yet.
Promise you won't tell Brad?
Cross my heart
and hope to die.
-
-
-
-
Oh, Brad, darling,
it's no good here!
It'll destroy us.
Don't worry, Janet.
We'll be away from here in the morning.
Oh, Brad, you're so strong
and protective.
Wha...
You!
I'm afraid so, Brad.
But isn't it nice?
Why, you...
What have you done with Janet?
Nothing.
Why, do you think I should?
You tricked me. I wouldn't have.
I've never, never. Never!
Yes, I know.
But it isn't all bad, is it?
Not even half bad.
I think you'll really quite enjoy it.
- So soft. So sensual.
- No, stop, stop. No.
Oh, Janet.
- Janet!
- Shh!
Janet's probably asleep by now.
Do you want her to see you like this?
Like this? Like how?
It's your fault! You're to blame.
I thought it was the real thing!
Oh, come on, Brad, admit it.
You liked it, didn't you?
There's no crime in giving yourself
over to pleasure.
Oh, Brad, you've wasted
so much time already.
Janet needn't know.
I won't tell her.
You promise you won't tell?
On my mother's grave.
Master, Rocky has broken his chains
and vanished.
The new playmate is loose
and somewhere in the castle grounds.
Magenta has just released the dogs.
Hmm? Oh.
- Coming!
- Oh!
What is happening here?
Where's Brad?
Where's anybody?
Oh, Brad!
Brad, my darling. Oh!
How could I have done this to you?
Oh! If only we hadn't
made this journey.
If only the car hadn't broken down.
Oh! If only we were
amongst friends...
or sane persons.
Oh, Brad.
What have they done with him?
Oh, Brad! How could you?
Oh!
Oh. But you're hurt.
Did they do this to you?
Here. I'll dress your wounds.
Poor baby, there. Oh.
"Emotion: Agitation
or disturbance of mind;
vehement or excited mental state."
It is also a powerful
and irrational master.
And from what Magenta and Columbia
eagerly viewed on their television monitor,
there seemed little doubt
that Janet was indeed its slave.
Tell us about it, Janet.

- How did it happen?
I understood
you were to be watching.
I was only away for a minute,
master.
Well, see if you can find him
on the monitor.
Master.
Hey! Scotty!
Dr. Everett Scott.
You know this earthling...
this... person?
I most certainly do. He happens
to be an old friend of mine.
I see.
So this wasn't simply
a chance meeting.
You came here
with a purpose.
I told you, my car broke down.
I was telling the truth.
I know what you told me, Brad.
But this Dr. Everett Scott,
his name is not unknown to me.
He was a science teacher
at Denton High School.
And now he works for your government,
doesn't he, Brad?
- What? - He's attached
to the Bureau of Investigation...
of that which you call U.F.O.'s!
- Isn't that right, Brad?
- He might be. I don't know.
The intruder is entering
the building, master.
He'll probably be in...
in the Zen Room.
Shall we inquire of him in person?
Great Scott!
Frank-N-Furter.
We meet at last.
Dr. Scott!
Brad. What are you doing here?
Don't play games, Dr. Scott.
You know perfectly well
what Brad Majors is doing here.
It was part of your plan, was it not,
that he and his female
should check the layout for you?
Well, unfortunately for you all,
the plans are to be changed.
I know Brad is.
I can assure you that Brad's presence here
comes as a complete surprise to me.
I came here to find Eddie.
- Eddie? I've seen him. He's...
- Eddie?
What do you know of Eddie,
Dr. Scott?
I happen to know a great deal
about a lot of things.
You see, Eddie
happens to be my nephew.
Dr. Scott.
- Janet!
- Dr. Scott!
- Janet!
- Brad!
Rocky!
- Janet!
- Dr. Scott!
- Janet!
- Brad!
Rocky!
- Janet!
- Dr. Scott!
- Janet!
- Brad!
Rocky!
Listen! I made you,
and I can break you just as easily.
Master! Dinner is prepared!
Excellent.
Under the circumstances,
formal dress is to be optional.
Food has always played a vital role
in life's rituals.
The breaking of bread, the last meal
of the condemned man...
and now this meal.
However informal it might appear,
you can be sure there was to be
very little bonhomie.
A toast.
-
- To absent friends.
And Rocky.
# Happy birthday to you #
# Happy birthday, dear Rocky #
-
- Shall we?
We came here to discuss Eddie.
- Eddie!
-
That's a rather tender subject.
Excuse me.
I knew he was in with a bad crowd,
but it was worse than I imagined.
-
- Huh?
Dr. Scott!
Go on, Dr. Scott.
- It's all right!
-
That's all right, Brad.
# From the day he was born #
# He was trouble #
# He was the thorn #
# She tried in vain #
# But he never caused her
nothing but shame #
# He left home #
# From the day she was gone #
# All he wanted #
# Was rock-and-roll porn #
# Und  #
# He was a low-down
cheap little punk #
# Taking everyone for a ride #
# When Eddie said
he didn't like his teddy #
# You knew he was a no-good kid #
# But when he threatened your life
with a switchblade knife #
- # What a guy #
- # Makes you cry #
#  I did #
# Everybody shoved him #
# I very nearly loved him #
# I said, hey, listen to me #
# Stay sane inside insanity #
# But he locked the door
and threw away the key #
# But he must've been drawn #
# Making him warn me #
- # In a note which reads #
- # What's it say, what's it say #
# I'm out of my head #
# They mustn't carry out
their evil deeds #
# When Eddie said
he didn't like his teddy #
# You knew he was a no-good kid #
But when he threatened your life
with a switchblade knife #
- # What a guy #
- # Makes you cry #
#  I did #
# When Eddie said
he didn't like his teddy #
# You knew he was a no-good kid #
# But when he threatened your life
with a switchblade knife #
# What a guy #
# Whoa, oh, oh #
# Makes you cry #
# Hey, hey, hey #
#  I did #
# Eddie ##
Oh.
Oh, Rocky!
How could you?
Quick! This way! This way!
Shut up!
# I'll tell you once
I won't tell you twice #
# You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss #
# Your apple pie
don't taste too nice #
# You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss #
-  - # I've laid the seed
It should be all you need #
# You're as sensual as a pencil #
# Wound up like an E
or first string #
# When we made it
did ya hear a bell ring #
# You got a block
Well, take my advice #
# You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss #
# The transducer
will seduce ya #
My feet! I can't move my feet!
My wheels!
My God, I can't move my wheels.
It's as if we're glued to the spot.
You are.
So quake with fear,
you tiny fools.
Oh, we're trapped.
# It's something you'll get used to #
- # A mental mind-fuck can be nice #
-  No!
You won't find Earth people
quite the easy mark you imagine.
it is, I suppose, some
kind of audio-vibratory,
physiomolecular
transport device?
- You mean...
- Yes, Brad.
It's something we ourselves have been
working on for quite some time.
But it seems our friend here
has found a means of perfecting it.
A device which is capable
of breaking down solid matter...
and then projecting it
through space...
and, who knows,
perhaps even time itself.
You mean he's gonna
send us to another planet?
# Planet schmanet, Janet #
# You'd better wise up
Janet Weiss #
# You'd better wise up
Build your thighs up #
# You'd better wise up #
And then she cried out...
Stop!
# Don't get hot and flustered #
# Use a bit of mustard #
# You're a hot dog #
# But you'd better not
try to hurt her #
# Frank Furter #
# You're a hot dog #
# But you'd better not
try to hurt her #
# Frank Furter #
# You're a hot dog... ##
My God! I can't stand
any more of this.
First, you spurn me for Eddie,
and then you throw him off
like an old overcoat for Rocky.
You chew people up,
and then you spit them out again.
I loved you.
And what did it get me?
Yeah, I'll tell you... a big nothing.
You're like a sponge.
You take, take, take...
and drain others
of their love and emotion.
Well, I've had enough!
You've gotta choose
between me and Rocky...
so named because of
the rocks in his head.
- Mmm!
-
It's not easy having a good time.
Even smiling
makes my face ache.
And my children turn on me.
Rocky's behaving
just the way that Eddie did.
Do you think I made a mistake splitting
his brain between the two of them?
I grow weary of this world!
When shall we return
to Transylvania? Huh?
Magenta,
I am indeed grateful to both you
and your brother, Riff Raff.
You have both served me well.
Loyalty such as yours
shall not go unrewarded.
You will discover that, when the mood
takes me, I can be quite generous.
I ask for nothing, master.
And you shall receive it
in abundance!
Come. We are ready
for the floor show.
And so, by some
extraordinary coincidence,
fate, it seemed, had decided
that Brad and Janet...
should keep that appointment
with their friend, Dr. Everett Scott.
But it was to be in a situation...
which none of them
could have possibly foreseen.
And just a few hours
after announcing their engagement,
Brad and Janet had both tasted...
forbidden fruit.
This in itself was proof that
their host was a man of little morals...
and some persuasion.
What further indignities
were they to be subjected to?
And what of the floor show
that had been spoken of?
In an empty house...
in the middle of the night?
What diabolical plan...
had seized
Frank's crazed imagination?
What indeed?
From what had gone before,
it was clear that this
was to be no picnic.
# It was great
when it all began #
# I was a regular Frankie fan #
# But it was over
when he had the plan #
# To start a-workin' on a muscleman #
# Now the only thing
that gives me hope #
# Is my love of a certain dope #
# Rose tints my world #
# Keeps me safe
from my trouble and pain #
# I'm just seven hours old #
# Truly beautiful to behold #
# And somebody should be told #
# My libido hasn't been controlled #
# Now the only thing
I've come to trust #
# Is an orgasmic rush of lust #
# Rose tints my world #
# And keeps me safe
from my trouble and pain #
# It's beyond me #
# Help me, Mommy #
# I'll be good, you'll see #
# Take this dream away #
# What's this #
# Let's see #
# I feel sexy #
# What's come over me #
Whoo! # Here it comes again #
# I feel released #
# Bad times deceased #
# My confidence has increased #
# Reality is here #
# The game has been disbanded #
# My mind has been expanded #
# It's a gas that Frankie's landed #
# His lust is so sincere #
# Whatever happened #
# To Fay Wray #
# That delicate #
# Satin-draped frame #
# As it clung to her thigh #
# How I started to cry #
# 'Cause I wanted to be dressed #
# Just the same #
# Give yourself over #
# To absolute pleasure #
# Swim the warm waters #
# Of sins of the flesh #
# Erotic nightmares #
# Beyond any measure #
# And sensual daydreams #
# To treasure forever #
# Can't you just see it #
# Whoa-oh, oh #
# Don't dream it #
# Be it #
# Don't dream it #
# Be it #
# Don't dream it #
# Be it #
# Don't dream it #
# Be it #
# Be it #
# Don't dream it #
# Be it #
# Don't dream it #
# Be it #
# Don't dream it #
# Be it #
# Don't dream it #
Ach!
##
We've got to get...
out of this trap...
I've got to be strong...
try to hang on.
my life will be lived...
# For the thrill #
# It's beyond me #
# Help me, Mommy #
# God bless #

Hey!
# Frank-N-Furter #
# Your mission is a failure #
# I'm your new commander #
# You now are my prisoner #
# Prepare the transit beam ##
Wait!
I can explain.
# On the day I went away #
# Good-bye #
# Was all I had to say #
# Now I #
# I want to come again and stay #
# Oh, my, my #
# Smile and that will mean I may #
# May-ay #
# 'Cause I've seen #
# Oh #
# Blue skies through the tears #
- # In my eyes #
-
# And I realize #
# I'm going home #
# I'm going home #
# Everywhere, it's been the same #
# Feeling #
# Like I'm outside in the rain #
# Free to try and find a game #
# Cards for sorrow #
# Cards for pain #
# 'Cause I've seen #
# Oh #
# Blue skies #
# Through the tears #
# In my eyes #
# And I realize #
# I'm going home #
# I'm going home #
# I'm going home #
# I'm going home ##
Bravo! Bravo!
How sentimental.
And also
presumptuous of you.
You see,
when I said "we"
were to return to Transylvania,
I referred only
to Magenta and myself.
I'm sorry, however, if you found
my words misleading.
But, you see,
you are to remain here...
in spirit anyway.
-  Good heavens, that's a laser.
-  Yes, Dr. Scott.
A laser capable of emitting
a beam of pure anti-matter.
You mean you're going to kill him?
- What's his crime?
- You saw what became of Eddie.
Society must be protected.
Exactly, Dr. Scott.
And now, Frank-N-Furter,
your time has come.
Say good-bye to all of
and hello to oblivion.
No.
No. No!
Good God!
You killed them.
But I thought you liked them.
They liked you.
They didn't like me!
They never liked me!
You did right.
A decision had to be made.
You're okay by me.
Dr. Scott,
I'm sorry about your...
nephew.
Eddie?
Yes, well, perhaps
it was for the best.
You should leave now, Dr. Scott,
while it is still possible.
We are about to beam the entire house
back to the planet of Transsexual...
in the galaxy of Transylvania.
Go.
Now.
Our noble mission
is almost completed,
my most... beautiful sister.
And soon we shall return...
to the moon-drenched shores
of our beloved planet.
Ah.
Sweet Transsexual.
Land of night.
To sing and dance once more
to your dark refrain.
To take that...
step to the right.
Hah!
But it's the pelvic thrust...
# That really drives you insane #
And our world...
# I've done a lot #
# God knows I've tried #
# To find the truth #
# I've even lied #
# But all I know #
# Is down inside I'm #
# Bleeding #
# And superheroes #
# Come to feast #
# To taste the flesh #
# Not yet deceased #
# And all I know #
# Is still the beast is #
# Feeding #
# And crawling #
# On the planet's face #
# Some insects #
# Called the human race #
# Lost in time #
# And lost in space #
# And meaning #
