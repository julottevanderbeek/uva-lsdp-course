There is nothing in it.
Yes, you're right.
vergheese, is this how you do business?
Yes, this is how l do it.
ls this how you do business?
l was patient while you were
replacing all these.
What so big deal in it?
They are not coconuts at all.
Then, are they beetle nuts?
Anyway, l'm not going to replace them.
Don't try to fool me.
There is no use talking to him.
No need to check those coconuts.
Let me see.
There is nothing to be surprised about it.
He is the son of the man who doesn't
even mind taking a coin from shit.
He resembles his father.
Careful! Don't abuse my father.
Why are you getting tensed unnecessarily?
Now dare to abuse my father again.
l wasn't talking to you at all.
Who else were you talking to?
l was talking to vergheese.
But still it was about me
you were talking about.
Catch hold of him.
Let them say anything.
Why are you getting tensed unnecessarily?
Mother, you didn't hear what he said.
May be he is drunk.
l should've chopped him into pieces.
Leave me.
How can he talk like that?
He never used to open his mouth
when your father was alive.
But now, look how he is talking.
After his father's death,
everyone has started to wag their tails.
He will say anything he likes.
He has the right on our land.
Everyone is on his side.
Landlords have none on their side.
Stop, don't go.
- What did he think of me?
Go inside.
l'm talking to you knowing
the current market rates.
Yes. Rs. 1 .20.
There are totally 60 trees.
l can't tell you how many l will get.
May be.
May be few more than your count.
l'm not desperate to sell.
lf you accept my rate, come.
Orelse why waste time & money.
Listen, if you don't come
on the said date,
then there is no point in blaming me.
Yes.
l'll find a another buyer.
Okay. Bye.
Don't you have to take bath?
ls it enough if you keep counting numbers?
Let the pond cool down.
lt is still hot.
You never know to take bath
& keep yourself clean.
To take bath...?
Only now l came back from work.
That's what l'm trying to say.
Me too.
Who is that at this hour?
ls it Rishi?
So, you have come!
He is not going to take bath.
Have you got it?
- Yes.
lf we give it to him,
it is very tough to get it back.
Don't you know anyother guy
other than him?
There is no point in blaming him.
How many times have you got it repaired?
lt has been repaired very well.
Here on, it will run very smoothly.
lt will run for another 8 1/2 months.
Why 8 1/2?
Why not 9 months?
l've a doubt.
Will you tell the truth?
Tell me sister.
You take this to town to get it repaired
and bring it back.
Don't you charge for these?
- Charge means?
Won't you take money for it?
Hey...
He charges for all his expenses.
Rs.5 for taking it
& Rs. 6 for bringing it back.
Totally Rs. 1 1 for transportation.
What do you think of him?
He is very clever.
Just for Rs. 1 1? So sad!
You both gel very well.
How is your new venture?
ls it profitable?
lt's better we don't discuss about it.
Only if any bulb in a near by house get fused,
l'll get business.
The wires & cables which l bought
are still untouched.
lt's better they don't rust.
There is a solution for it.
l know what you do.
You sit on a chair
& ogle at the girls who pass by.
There is a little truth
in what you said.
l can atleast have a good view
of the girls.
That's why l stay there.
There is nothing in this village.
l'm only an ordinary guy.
You can lead a luxurious life since
you're the son of Thambooran.
But can l lead such a life?
l'm getting few proposals for marriage.
lf they ask about my job, l will tell
them that l've business in town.
When l live in town, l can look
after the business & ogle at girls.
You can only ogle at girls & nothing more.
You have such a charming
& a lucky face.
Yes, it is true.
They are only kids.
Why talk about town?
You come here once in a week.
That's why you don't know
what's happening in the village.
Do you know what all is happening here?
You should listen to the
experiences of little boys.
Those are real life experiences.
We'll be shocked to hear that.
We must also break that.
Go ahead. Who is stopping you?
Tresya Joseph lives close to your house.
Shit!
- What shit!
She is now the dream girl of this village.
She is the cuckoo of this village.
Really?
All the boys of the village are after her.
She goes to town very frequently
in different A/C cars.
l've heard some rumours about her.
Since she is your neighbour,
Why not try once?
There is nothing to lose.
No.
l can't spoil may image in the village.
lf we lose our status
& image here, where else can we go?
lf we are not careful,
our image will get spoiled.
You will die due to constipation.
You too.
Where is Devi electricals shop?
- Go that way.
That way...?
l've found you.
lt was very difficult to find your shop.
How come you are here?
lt's very hot.
Jose, order 2 teas please.
- No tea. l've to go.
C'mon, you came just now.
That doesn't mean l've no urgent work.
You showroom is well decorated.
What brought you here?
l came here to buy a goat's head.
To make soup for my mother.
lt is a good cure for the pain
in the joints.
Unlike in village,
we get it very fresh here.
Since l've come this far,
l will buy some vegetables too.
The prices are very cheap.
But still,
have you come here to buy
vegetables & goat's head?
Do you believe me now?
Yes.
- Then, come with me.
The bike is in the workshop.
No need for any bike.
Jose, l'll be back soon.
Take it. 20...22...23.
You've given me less than what l told you.
This is enough.
- What?
What l have given you is enough.
You've given me less.
l counted before giving you.
l've given you what l told you.
Wonderful!
Are you the deciding authority?
Yes, in this matter, l decide.
Take this too.
What is this?
- Why bargain for a dead goat's head?
That's what l'm telling you.
So do l.
very hot!
Summer has just started.
l can't stay in my room,
if it is too hot.
You are really great.
Can we have a lime juice?
Lime juice with salt is good during summer.
Yes, it is good.
But it might cost 3 rupees.
lt's okay.
What is the use in earning
if we don't spend a little?
Need more salt?
- Salt?
Salt doesn't cost much.
Got lce cubes?- Sorry.
What's the use of having a
lime juice without ice cubes?
No ice cubes.
You should've told this before.
You should've asked me before.
- Should l?
Yes, you must.
They why did you put up this board?
What is the meaning of COOLDRlNKS?
lt means cool.
Okay, l'll goto school & learn.
What did you say?
No brother...
- Shut your mouth.
lnspite of you giving you
my hard earned money.
should l have to hear what ever you say?
Drink if you want
or else pour it down & leave.
l won't mind if you don't pay for it.
Who wants your charity?
l don't want your dirty lime juice.
You drink it yourself.
l'll find out a shop which gives
lime juice with ice.
Come, lets go.
Shall we go?- But where?
Just come with me.
Go.
Come.
Let the auto wait here.
We'll have a glass of fresh juice.
l'll be back soon.- Okay.
Come.
Hey...- Leave my hand. Come.
Nobody's here.
Thank god! No one here knows me.
Men of our age used to come here.
And l've caught them red handed.
lf anyone sees us here...
- So what?
My honour goes into this air.
- How?
What are you blabbering man?
Will you lose your honour
for drinking lime juice?
Come here.
Got ice cubes?
- For what? To cool your head?
& without soda.
Add salt instead of sugar.
Squeeze one full lime.
Shouldn't we enjoy our life?
Enjoy? ls this the way to enjoy?
What you said is right?
Enjoy means we must enjoy fully.
Can we have a beer?
lt's nice to have a beer
in this hot summer.
That's true. But now...here?
David, do you have Kingfisher beer...chilled?
Yes, we have.
- 2 bottles of beer.
l was wondering what you are up to.
Please have it.
So, you drink regularly?
No. very rarely.
Who is that?
So you've come.
He's Jacob. He's Unni master.
He's Babu.
He's lnashu.
Stop staring at us.
You drink.
Mr. George, what's the hot news?
Nothing hot.
l was watching him performing
a new play.
Come here.
How are you?
ls it your bag?
What's in it?

There is goat's head in it.
Keep it down.
Look, he is Babu.
Devamadha...
Yes, Devamadha.
He is the owner of Devamadha.
His family owns totally 1 7 buses.
Babu, he is Rishi into electrical business.
Electrical business?
What business is that?
Where?
- ln the market. Devi Electricals.
Devi Electricals...?
Electricity to Devi ?
He is my friend.
He lives near my house.
Don't rag him.- Okay.
Lets not waste time.
Lets party.
How did you escape from the party?
That's a very big story.
l'm not drunk.
l remember very well.
What's our next programme?
- As you say.
Can we break his ..............?
l didn't drink much.
Don't pay for the bills.
Never pay for the bills.
- Sit here.
l'm going there only.
You bring him there.- Okay.
Bye David.
What's happening?
Even your intestines might come out.
What's this?
Can you keep quiet for a while?
lt's enough.
What's all this?
Enough.
Make no noise. Take it.
Lime juice...
- We didn't pay for the lime juice.
Stop it.
l'll beat you.
Stop it.
A chic waiting inside.
You told me about your desire,
didn't you?
l think the boy in the counter
is from our place.
Let him be.
Get in.
What bothers me?
Will he cause me some trouble
in the hotel?
No trouble.
Because we have booked the entire floor.
lf any problem crops up,
l'll buy this hotel.
Want to see that happen? Come.
Do you recognize her?
Tresia Jose.
She is from our village.
Are you going to say you don't know me?
l know you.
You both don't have any problem,
do you?
Shall we move?- Yes.
l knew it.
lf l stay here, this play will continue.
Don't stay here.
Will you be here?
- Yes. You can leave.
He is my friend.
- l'll take care of him.
Bye.
lt's only a child's play to him.
When compared to his other activities,
these are nothing.
Did he leave last night itself?
ln your town, people hate him
for being so stingy.
Which of the two is true?
To him, everything means fun.
He is more trustworthy than a bank.
You can stay here till 12 O'clock.
No, l'll move now.
What you told me about him is true, ah?
Yes, whatever l told you about him is true.
Why should l lie to you about him?
You said he never slept
with any girl till now.
As far as l know, he never did.
He does such things for his friends.
l understood.
Does he have lot of friends in this town?
l didn't know.
He lived here for more than 4 yrs.
He used to be a hero
when he was in college.
He had spent most of his father's earnings.
He never needs any money
to do anything in this town.
How is that possible?
Yes, it is possible.
Everyone knows about him.
He personally comes
& pays the dues within a week.
That his secret.
And he'll leave without anyone's knowledge.
So, hotels, bars, taxis
offer their free service to him.
lf l tell this to the villagers,
they will beat me.
Why do you want to tell them unnecessarily?
l told you all this because he told me
to tell you if you ask about him.
We should have brought aunty with us.
All the 9 houses are in different directions.
My mother knows.
That's why she sent us.
She sent us to wander around the village.
Somebody is coming this way.
Here? Who are they?
Stop staring at them. Do your work.
Where is Mannarthodi's house?
Mannarthodi...?
What's the matter?
Where are you coming from?
From town.- l knew it.
Why do you want to goto his house?
l'm from Mannarthodi. Tell me.
Jaikrishna Menon...
- Yes.
You must have heard about me.
- l've also seen him.
You were my senior in college.
Really? What's your name?
- Ranjini.
You won't remember me.
Jaikrishnan has changed a lot.
We've to change.
Ranjini, what are you doing?
- l'm a teacher.
Teaching students.

Where is he?
- He is living abroad.
Where exactly?
- Saudi.
So, you meet him once in a year.
He went very recently.

We came to invitite you.
- For what?
For a ''Sapthathi''?
Sapthathi means 70th birthday, right?
You don't look like 70 yr. old women?
Not us.
lt is for our Great grandmother.
- Whose great grandmother?
Ours. She is Radha, my cousin.
My father's sister's daughter.
l live with her in town.
When is the function?
- On 7th.
l can't come.
No need.
We came to invite the ladies only.
Malini sister, Sridevi kutty,
Karthiadithiamma.
One of them will come.
Who? How do you know them?
Do you know Malini's husband
late Kunjikrishnan?- Yes.
Kunjikrishnan's sister's husband
is K.R. Marathu.
Yes Marathu.
Radha's father married K.R.'s sister.
That means my mother's brother,
Baskar uncle.
So she is from Thiruvarpathu...?
Yes, you're right.
- Only now l understood.
You've a brother named Madhavan
who is a journalist. - Yes.
So, you have also come here before.
Yes. But long back.
Wow! You've grown up very fast.
When you came here before,
you were very bony.
While coming this way,
you sit on Madhavan cycle's hand bar
and you used to look like
a little lizard.
Are you not coming with us
to your house?- l'll try.
Go straight & you'll end up
in our garden.
From there, you can see our house.
Go straight.
What did you say your name is?
Radha.- Yes, Radha.
When you meet anyone,
try to give some respect.
What is this?
- He is very uncultured.
l told her that l like her.
You could've told me when she was here.
What would've happened?
l would've enquired about
that girl with Ranjini.
Why beat around the bush?
l myself would've told her.
Will she pounce on me if l tell her?
How can we talk about this to girls
of this generation?
lf we take this proposal to them,
they'll surely accept it.
lt isn't because you're smart.
lt's because you are the
son of Justice Thambooran.
Or else no intelligent
& modern girl will ever marry you.
l'll throw this on you.
Now the bell will ring.
Everyone will go to their classes.
We'll have to wait here
for another 1 1/2 hr.
l'll make her come out the class.
What do you think of me?
This is our college.
We had spent 4 yrs. studying here.
Do you know l made this college principal
drink his first peg of liquor?
Actually, he was my professor.
Go. But beware of boys.
What boys!
l came in search of you.
Please come.
Come l say.
l would like to marry you.
Do you have any objection?
lf you've any problem, just tell me now.
l feel disturbed. That's why l came here.
Since when are you disturbed?
- From the moment l saw you.
lt's better you change yourself.
l'm very serious.
You don't have to reply right away.
l couldn't stop myself saying this to you.
That's why l came here.
Why did you come to college
early morning?
l'm not here to create any problem.
You don't have to reply to me.
Malini sister or Ranjini will talk to you.
Tell your decision to them.
Till then, let this disturbance continue.
l like it.
l've nothing to say
to Malini sister or Ranjini.
l tell you my decision right now.
l don't like you.
l've heard a lot about you.
After seeing you, l realized that
you're more than what l heard about you.
You want to be disturbed, right?
But please relieve me out of it.
Who is he? What is he to you? Shall we deal with him?
Radha had ''Moolakuru'' problem in the morning.
l mean Piles.
Her mother sent me to know how she is.
When l spoke to her,
her piles problem became worse.
She is hot because of that.
Don't worry my dear.
lt will pain for a while.
You don't have to worry about that.
Now, go to your class.
Met her?
- l couldn't meet her.
l told you, didn't l?
What should we do now?
Lets go.- Then...?
We'll have lime juice.
Lime juice? Now?
Did it happen like that?
lf she tells this to her family,
won't everyone in our village
come to know about this?
l don't care about that.
lt's not that.
Only now l realise how foolish l was.
Should l have to worry about this?
Why should l?
She said she doesn't like me.
l like her & everyone woman in this city.
Now you'll see who l am.
Drink & leave quickly.
lf you stay here, you'll cause trouble.
You've a bus now.
Or else l'll take you in my scooter.
Don't stay in this town
with your disturbed mind.
No need.
Please sit.
How did you know that l was here?
To be frank,
l would've phoned your home in 2 days.
There is something you have to see.
Nothing.
lt is to discuss some personal matter.
Okay, l'll move. You continue.
l've some work in my shop.
Better don't create new problems.
Don't even offer him a drop of liquor.
He is very upset.
Really...?
- He is joking.
Bye.
What is so personal you want to discuss?
A small favour.
Favour...?
For you? From me?
Tell me what it is.
There is something.
We'll talk about it having a beer?
- No.
Lets not discuss about it now.
l thought of coming to your house
& discuss it.
What is so serious about it?
lt's about bringing a new girl
into this profession.
We've our own place.
Lets go there & talk.
lf we stay here,
unnecessary thoughts will disturb us.
That will create problems,
which in turn makes things more difficult.
Come.
l think this is the address.
Read it.
Clara.- Yes.
Who is this Clara?
ls she into this profession?
lf she is in this profession,
why would l disturb you?
She must get introduced into my profession.
What for?
- For my livelihood.
l & her step mother have planned
to bring her to this profession.
That's why l'm giving you this address.
What should we do with this address?
We have to write a letter to this address,
as if Mother Superior
of a church around here.
Should l write the letter?
l came for your help
because l'm an illeterate.
What should Mother Superior write?
l'll tell you.
But before that,
you must know who she is,
who are her relatives & more.
When did you first see her?
l met her in this town a year back,
in a group which had come for an excursion.
l noticed her then.
l saw her last week.
Just because l'm old, no one suspects me.
That's how l met her.
- Then what?
Her mother is dead. She lives with her father.
And her qualification?
- She had failed in her pre-degree.
Her father is a drunkard.
Because of that,
she has financial problems at home.
She has a step-mother.
Her step-mother's children
are her only relatives.
Have you been to her house?- Yes.
l met her step-mother.
- Then...?
She was expecting a person like me.
She had planned to bring Clara
to this profession long back.
We should first get Clara
join the christian missionary.
We got her father's permission too.
This letter is to convince
her mother's brother.
The letter will be from the missionary.
On seeing the letter,
she will come out.
We shouldn't go there for some days.
l had promised her step mother
that l'll give the letter.
l don't know how to write
like a mother superior.
lt is just a formality.
lt'll be fine.
But still, we do need their letter head,
don't we?
That's not a matter of concern.
lf nothing works out,
we'll print one.
l'll come tomorrow morning with all these.
You be ready with the contents.
As that boy said, go home
& don't drink any lime juice.
''May god bless you''
To dear Clara,
l was very happy to read your letters.
By god's grace, l'm happy to inform you that
you've been selected to serve god.
You & your step-mother
must come to the missionary on 23rd.
Your step-mother can stay here
for a couple of days.
We feel very happy on your growth.
While coming, bring snacks to eat.
You shouldn't have been
so rude to him.
What else can l do?
There is a limit to everything.
He is both stingy & shameless.
Since l was so rude to him,
he won't disturb me anymore.
After his visit to college,
boys have something to talk about.
Now boys have given me a nick name.
- Nick name?
lt has started.
- What do they call you?
Really?
Shit!
Did Jaikrishnan of Mannarthuudi
met you in college?
Yes. How did you know that?
Brother of a girl studying there told me.
So, that has become the hot news, ah?
Radha, come inside.
l wonder what else is going
to happen. Rogue!
When l told him to get lost,
he started to blabber like a lunatic.
That's all.
He must be knowing
that you are my sister.
He knows & he even told me.
lf he approches you again,
inform me.
Approch you? That's impossible.
He got very nicely from me.
He must be after someother girl by now.
No. You must be careful at this point.
l know him for many years.
l can narrate you 100 different stores
about him.
But this is first time
Jayakrishnan has approched a girl.
The first time.
l think, since you had been very rude
to him, he must have felt hurt.
Not even his close friends
can predict his next move.
Once he takes a decision,
he never steps back.
He has people to anything
for him in this town.
Do you know that?
That's why l'm telling you,
if he approaches you at anytime,
inform me.
Got it?
Now you can go.
l don't recognize you.
Mannarkudi Jayakrishnan...
- This is his house.
He is inside. l'll call him.
Please sit inside.
Where are you coming from?
- Actually...
l haven't seen you before.
l come here very rarely.
Master, how come you are here?
Mother, don't you know Kurukkal master?
He was my teacher
when l was in 5th class.
Kurukkal master.
lt's been very long since we met.
How did you remember me now?
Please sit inside. Come.
Sit...please sit.
What would you like to have?
Coffee or horlicks?
No thanks.
No way. You must have something.
Tea. You don't drink tea, do you?
very good memory.
You were the same when you were a kid.
He is stubborn even now.
We can give him a lime juice.
ls that enough?
Yes, that's enough.
Would you like to have tender coconut?
No. Lime juice is enough.
The girl has come.- Who?
Clara.
Mother, do you have oats?- Yes.
Mix it with banana & bring it.
Master is very hungry.
He felt little shy to tell you.
Till then,
l'll show him our house & lands.
She is with her step-mother.
You must also do me another favour.
You must find out what's in her heart.
How can l?
l came for your help because
l don't trust anyone else.
lf l could get her,
my business will go on even
if l don't have other girls.
She'll also be profited.
very huge profits.
But we have find out whether
she is our kind of a girl.
Don't you know how to bring girls
to your profession?
l knew it is difficult
from the moment l saw her.
What do you want me to do?
Nothing much.
Come with me to town.
lf possible,
stay for a couple of days.
Tell your mom that l've a problem
to be solved & come with me.
You must find out what's in her heart.
What do you mean?
l want to know whether if someone
offers her a bungalow & a car,
will she accept that offer
& go with him?
What a job!?
What contractor?
- Kunjnu's contractor.
Don't change the name.
Kunjnu's contractor.
Please get inside.
This is the best suit available.
Please sit.
l told you about the Kunjnu's contractor,
didn't l?
Yes...
Where is she?
There she is.
Kunjnu's contractor.
A big timber merchant.
Please sit.- No, l like to stand.
Please come here.
- Come & sit here.
Shall l order for soda?
What's it?
l've seen people drinking in the evenings,
but you....
lt is funny to her.
She thinks l'm talking
about her drunkard father.
What's your name?
My name is Glory.
Since everyone call me that way,
it has become my name.
Now, l like that name.
They will bring soda in a moment.
The brief...
Are you going to be here
till the soda comes?
Oh! No way.
That's 310. This is 31 1 .
lf you need anything, just call.
Your daughter is very lucky.
One should fall in the
right hands to come up in life.
Who do you think he is?
- ls he very rich?
lf he likes her, he'll treat her like a queen.
lt's true.
l'll meet you later.
Why haven't you fallen in love till now?
lt isn't true, is it?
Why should l lie to you?
So, you never felt like falling in love.
What is the reason?
- How do l know?
The men l met aren't qualified for that.
Am l qualified?
What is the use of it?
You've a wife & children.
What should l ruin your happy family life?
l will ask you something.
Will you tell me the truth?
Go ahead.
ls it your own decision?
- Yes.
What is the reason?
Did l ask you the reason
for coming here?
l didn't.
No.
You haven't had sex with anyone before,

l didn't know that.
l thought you had sex before.
From the day l knew,
it is quarrel everyday.
l was fed up with my life.
So...
Quarrel with whom? ls it Beatrice?
l used to quarrel much with her.
She fights with me for every reason.
First she used to beat me.
When l lost control,
l slapped her once.
After that incident,
we fight everyday.
And l started winning.
lf l have to live in that house,
l must chose this profession.
They themselves are finding ways
to push me in to this profession.
Do you want to be saved from getting ruined?
Anyway, l will get ruined.
But let me get ruined by a good man.
And l can die after
my desires get fulfilled?
l think you didn't open the briefcase.
Here is what you told me to buy.
l don't know whether
this is what you asked for.
Just a second.
Are you telling the truth?
- Yes.
She hadn't been touched
by a man till now.
l didn't know that.
May be she was waiting for you.
l should'nt have done that.
You must rather feel lucky.
Forget it.
Did you find out what's in her heart?
Were you not able to find out
or was she very stubborn?
l never asked her about that.
And she is not easily understandble.
l knew that.
That's why l sought your help.
l too don't think l'll be successful.
Everygirl coming to this profession
has a soft story.
l'll lose before her.
Everything will be alright.
First you open the briefcase.
The mood will change. Come.
l forgot to ask you.
We know eachother
for more than 5 yrs, right?
Yes.
There are lot many stories between us.
You used to trap girls,
enjoy & leave them.
But in this, you got trapped, right?
Like her,
is this the first time for you too?
Yes.
l'll get you a beautiful bungalow.
A bungalow costing Rs. 7 - 8.
Rs. 8 means, a cartboard house?
Rs. 8 means 8 lacs.
Grinder, mixie, Tv...
a fully furnished house.
And a Maruthi...
a green coloured one.
To girls like you,
Maruthi is the best.
Maruthi is enough.
Will you teach me how to drive?
You think l'm kidding.
- No.
You didn't have a drop of liquor.
You made me drink a bottle of whisky
and enjoying?
Dear, are you enjoying?
You don't have to enjoy that way.
Lets go to the beach
Beach?
Beach behind this coconut groove.
A beautiful beach.
l don't want to go.
Don't be crazy.
Breathing fresh air
in the beach means crazy to you?
Breathing fresh air
in the evenings aren't crazy.
But going to breathe fresh air
at night are crazy.
ls this the law?- Yes.
Lets break that law.
Come.
Why are you rubbing against me?
So, you know everyone around here?
- Yes.
What would the hotel men think about us?
Who cares what they think about us?
Now, l'm going to buy this hotel.
Want to see that?
What hotel is this!?
Full of steps.
Why are repeating the same thing?
Because you didn't give me perfect reply.
l don't want to be a concubine.
ls that enough?
What's the reason?
- l know the reason.
There are many people waiting
to make me their concubine.
Let me count the number of people
who want me to be their concubine.
Even if l wish to,
do you want me to be
a timber contractor's concubine?
l can rather search for prospective customer.
very greedy.
- What did you say? Come again
very greedy!
O timber merchant!
Who are you? Tell me the truth.
l know whatever you said from morning
till now is a lie.
Only because of that,
l told you the truth.
But we both have to be united.
lf you tell me the truth,
it'll be useful for both of us.
Tell me the truth.
Everything will come good.
l'm...
l'm mother superior.
l guessed.
lf Radha wasn't rude to me,
l wouldn't have met Clara.
l might have met you,
but not this way.
l had controlled myself all these years
without losing to any woman.
l kept myself in a nutshell so as to give
myself to a woman l liked.
From now on,
l'm afraid that l may try everyone.
Nothing like that.
You meet Radha once more.
Not in the college.
But somewhere else.
She will come.
One day you will find her in Mannarthudi.
You'll have 3-4 children.
And l will come to see that.
a bit of evil,
l'm a mixture of all these.
l knew it.
And today,
Clara broke my stubborness.
l never wanted to be the firstman
to spoil a girl's life.
l never wanted to be a cause
for a girl to lose her virginity.
lf that happens,
l had taken a vow to make her my wife.
l would like to marry you.
You don't have any problem,
do you?
No.
But you have change your caste.
What do you mean?
- To go into the sea.
We'll go.
lt's not enough if you go.
While coming back,
you must make some catch.
ls it enough if you have anything
in the net?
ls that enough?
Then...?
l want the boat full of...
