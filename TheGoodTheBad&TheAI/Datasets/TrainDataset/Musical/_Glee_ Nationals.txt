So here's what you missed
on Glee: The Glee Club started
out as underdogs,
singing show tunes in the choir
room, and now they're headed
to Chicago
to compete for a national
championship.
I mean, they made it
to Nationals last year
in New York,
but they came in 12th.
It was sort of a nightmare.
Rachel's nightmare totally
came true when she choked
at her NYADA audition,
and literally all she's talked
about for three years is New
York, Broadway, Streisand,
Dreams, Broadway.
Ugh!
And that's what you missed
on Glee.
What's going on?
How bad is it?
Her temperature's 101 degrees.
Given the fact that Weezy's
complaining
about an upset stomach,
it's either Amazonian dengue
fever or the H1N1 super virus.
Or I have
food poisoning.
We all wanted burritos for
lunch, so we went to Chipotle,
but Mercedes tried some dive
called "Se√±ora Salsation."
Will, word, please.
With Monique down
for the count,
we are entering
the Hunger Games of
show choir competition
without one of our most
powerful voices.
We need to have a plan.
Right. Because if New
Directions doesn't win
that means you go back
to being co-captains
of the Cheerios with
Roz Washington.
Your sniping is as expository
as it is wrong.
Yes, I have fantasized
about handing that prize money
to Principal Figgins
so I could buy back my sole
control of the Cheerios,
but my main concern right now
is for these kids.
I want this win for them.
I just don't want everything
we worked for to collapse
because of one bad burrito.
So here's what's gonna happen:
Mercedes, you're on bed rest,
Quinn, you're stepping in.
No, no, no, I can't
dance that number. I can't sing
it, either, not like...
The Trouble Tones need you.
And you're better than you
think you are.
Tina, you, too.
You're in the Trouble Tones.
Mr. Shue, this is my last
competition.
I don't want to miss it.
Amen, to that, sister.
That's why I'm putting you
on a vitamin B-12 drip.
We're flushing your system
with Pedialyte, and I'm gonna
fill that bathtub with ice
and see if we can't get
your ambient body temperature
back down to normal.
All right, we all have
our marching orders.
Let's do it.
+++
Hey.
You okay?
What if we don't win? What's
gonna happen with those kids?
It's a competition.
They understand
that everybody can't win.
But they never get to win.
School's almost over,
forever for most of them.
Can you imagine what
what it would be like
for them
to have just a couple
of days walking the halls
as champions?
It's something
they would carry
around with them
for the rest
of their lives.
If you're gonna lead
them to the promised land,
you're gonna have
to have an attitude
adjustment.
But, Will,
they're ready.
You made 'em ready
for three years.
But what if it wasn't enough?
Will, you better
come downstairs.
We got a problem.
Hey, calm down!
Hey, hey, calm down! Calm down!
Fight, fight, fight!
Hey, cool out!
He's studying
for geography
while we're trying
to rehearse! It's bogus!
'Cause I already
know the dance!
You dance like you
got your feet caught
in bear traps.
You're trying
to gnaw them off.
Mr. Shue, are you aware
that while we're arguing
about jazz squares,
Unique is being handed the key
to the city by Rahm Emanuel?
Really?
And plus my pillow and my
blanket fell into the pool.
Disaster.
Look, I think everybody is
just a little tired.
We've been rehearsing
for three straight hours.
Yeah, and we'll rehearse
all night if we have to.
We can rest after we've won!
Just because we've lost Mercedes
doesn't mean we can be anything
less than perfect. Perfect!
That's easy for you to say.
Okay, you know what?
You know what?
Hey! I don't want
to hear any of this,
"We can't do it without her,"
because guess what?
We don't have a choice.
So be warned:
if you are not giving this
everything you've got,
I will go all
Lima Heights on
your sorry asses.
Listen to yourselves.
I know. I'm sorry.
I always go
to the yelling place.
I have rage.
No, it's a good thing.
A great thing.
There is so much passion
in this room
Even all your arguing,
it's about the work.
You guys really want this.
Okay, so let's take
a half-hour break,
and then we'll run it
from the top.
Mr. Shue, is it okay
if we keep going? We got
the first slot,
which is, like, the death slot.
We have to be amazing.
Yeah, "Edge of Glory's"
a bitch.
I said I'd be dancing
by nationals.
I'll be damned if I don't.
Okay, then let's
keep going.
Mike, help the guys out
with the choreography.
Artie, help Puck
with his geography.
Ladies, "Edge of Glory."
Come on.
Brittany, run us through it.
From the chorus?
Yeah, from the chorus.
Let's do it.
Watch out. We're gonna
do it. Okay. Ready?
Five, six,
seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five...
You okay?
...six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four...
Keep up.
Looking for what's left
of your dignity?
Nice to see you, too, Jessie.
If I were you, I'd be
spending more time fing
on how you're gonna wrap up
fourth place
than looking for her.
There's no way in hell
Carmen Tibideaux's coming here.
Wait. How do you know
about Carmen?
It's my business
to know everything
that goes on with
my competition.
I'm always looking
for that extra edge.
I hate to think
you pull the same
choke job up there today.
Look, I know exactly what
you're doing right now, okay?
We didn't date for that long,
and I don't even know how much
of it was actually real,
but when you get nervous,
you get mean
and you get really pale,
and then you start putting
your hands
through your hair
like Danny Zuko.
Look, you have no idea
the kind of pressure
I'm under.
Last year, Vocal Adrenaline
only lost for the first time
in eight years.
If we lose again
this year, that's it.
The dynasty is over.
The mystique and aura
that we used to intimidate
our opponents with will vanish.
I promised them that
I would reboot the program.
I'll be humiliated.
You did help the program.
What you did with
Unique was amazing.
It was a pretty
inspired idea of mine.
It was actually Kurt's
and Mercedes', but...
But I implemented it.
I don't know. I just think
these new rules are
messing with my head; 33%
of the numbers have
to be vintage? What does
that even mean?
The only thing vintage
about me is my Tyrone Powers
haircut and my pager.
Are you forgetting who you are,
Jesse, okay?
Your Bohemian Rhapsody was,
like, the benchmark performance
of every show choir
competition in the
past ten years.
Most people don't realize
I lost ten pounds
during that performance.
You guys are
gonna do great today.
Even though we're
definitely gonna beat you.
Oh, cocky all of a sudden.
I like it.
Hey, everything okay?
Yeah, everything's good.
I'm gonna go get ready.
It was very good to see you.
You, too.
Hi.
Heard you two are getting
married.
Yeah.
Good for you.
Good luck today.
You, too.
For me?
Well, it's for the wedding.
For the Jewish part
where you smash the glass.
It'ske, the climax
of the wedding, right?
Right before we kiss?
Yeah, it's supposed to symbolize
the fragility of life
or the destruction of the temple
or something like that.
It's very sweet.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But whatever. I wanted
a piece of this town
to be there.
This is the town where
everything's gonna change.
We're gonna go from losers
to National Champs.
Your optimism if very sexy.
Well, I'm so optimistic, I put
my money where my mouth is.
You want to bet me
that your dork club is gonna
outdork all the other
dork clubs
in the country?
You're so on.
Wait a minute.
That money was supposed
to be for our honeymoon, okay?
It was our money that we saved
from babysitting
and the tips you made
at the tire shop!
I'm gonna double it. I'm gonna
make it a thousand dollars.
That's, like, an extra
two nights in Niagara Falls.
What if we lose?
Not this time.
Carmen Tibideaux is coming,
and we're gonna be perfect.
And then we're
gonna get married,
and I'm gonna smash this glass,
and then we're gonna live
happily ever after.
I love you.
All right, gather around,
everyone!
I just want to say a few words
before we go out there.
Hold on, Mr. Shue. Hold on.
You've given us
a lot of pep talks
over the years, but remember,
you told us once
that, you know,
a teacher's job is done when his
students don't need him anymore?
Okay. Finn, the floor is yours.
Last night we all sat around
in a circle
after you went to bed
and we told stories.
But then we went around
the room,
and everybody said what they
wanted to win this thing for,
and we all said the same thing:
we want to win this for you.
Yeah.
And I know every year at school
Figgins gives away
the Teacher of the Year award.
But I don't think
any of us have to wait
to see how we feel about that.
You're, like, our
Teacher of a Lifetime.
GIRL:
Yeah.
Whoo!
Yeah, definitely.
Thank you, Finn, all of you.
I love you guys so much.
New Directions, line up.
All right, that's it.
Show time. Hands in, everyone.
Now I know you weren't planning
on doing the show circle
without me.
Mercedes?
You're alive!
Yeah, thanks to Sue.
She's a miracle worker.
Oh, well, it's amazing
what a little TLC,
some cortisone
and a witch doctor will do.
Thank God you're okay
because that just means
I'm not gonna fall on my face
during that Trouble Tones
number.
Oh, screw that.
This is our last time
performing together.
You're doing it,
and so you are you, Tina.
I'm not taking no
for an answer.
Plus I have so many steroids
going through my body right now,
I may turn into the Incredible
Hulk if you piss me off.
Okay, if we don't get out
of this room soon,
none of us will be performing.
Let's go!
Go, New Directions!
+++
Dick Butkus,
I beg of you,
chew your cud with
your mouth closed.
Sorry. I'm as nervous
as a cat in a room full
of rocking chairs.
Think how you'd feel
if your entire teaching
career were riding on this.
Okay?
I really wish
we weren't going first.
The kids are right,
it's the death slot.
Carmen Tibideaux isn't here,
Mercedes still has a fever.
I don't know if Quinn...
Okay.
EMCEE :
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the 48th annual
National High School
Show Choir Competition
brought to you in part

Please welcome our first
contestants,
from William McKinley High
School in Lima, Ohio,

There ain't a reason
You and me should be alone
tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
I got a reason that you
should take me home tonight
I need a man that thinks
it's right
But it's so wrong tonight,
yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
Right on the limits
It's where we know
we both belong tonight
It's hard to feel the rush
To push the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to,
to the edge with you
Where we can both fall
far in love
Out on the edge
Of glory
Glory
And I'm hanging on a moment
Of truth
I'm hanging on
a moment of truth
I'm on the edge
Of glory
Yeah...
And I'm hanging on
a moment with you
Hanging on a moment of truth
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge

a moment with you
With you, with you
With you, with you, with you
Yeah
I'm the edge
With you, with you, with you
With you, with you
Ah, yeah
I'm on the edge with you.
She didn't come.
FINN:
Stop it.
Look at me.
This is your moment!
Okay? Three years in the making.
Forget about everything else.
Take it.
There were nights when
the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun
Was so cruel
That all the tears
turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes
Were drying up forever
I finished crying
In the instant that you left
And I can't remember
where or when
Or how
And I banished every memory
You and I had ever made
But when you
touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming
back to me
It's all coming back
It's all coming back
to me now
There were moments of gold
And there were
flashes of light
There were nights of
endless pleasure
It was more than all your
Laws allowed
Baby, baby, baby
When you touch me like this
And when you hold me
like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming
back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming
back to me now.
Shah
shah shah
Well, I remember
every little thing
As if it happened
only yesterday
Parking by the lake
And there was not
another car in sight
And never had a girl
Looking any better
than you did
Ooh shah shah
ooh shah shah
And all the kids at school
They were wishing
they were me that night
And now our bodies
are oh so close and tight
Ooh shah shah
ooh shah shah
It never felt so good
It never felt so right
Ooh shah shah shah
ooh shah shah
And we're glowing like the
metal on the edge of a knife
Glowing like the metal
on the edge of a knife
Come on
Hold tight
Well, come on
Hold tight
Though it's cold and lonely
In the deep dark night
I can see paradise
By the dashboard light
Though it's cold and lonely
In the deep dark night
Paradise by
the dashboard light
We're gonna go
all the way tonight
We're gonna go all the way
and tonight's the night
We're gonna go
all the way tonight
We're gonna go all the way,
tonight's the night
We're gonna go
all the way tonight
We're gonna go all the way,
tonight's the night
We're gonna go
all the way tonight
We're gonna go all the way,
tonight's the night
Stop right there
I gotta know right now
Before we go any further
Do you love me?
Will you love me forever?
Do you need me?
Will you never leave me?
Will you make me so happy
for the rest of my life?
Will you take me away?
Will you make me your wife?
Let me sleep on it
Sleep on it
Baby, baby,
let me sleep on it
Sleep on it
Let me sleep on it
I'll give you an answer
in the morning
I gotta know right now
Do you love me?
Will you love me forever?
Do you, do you love me?
Do you need me?
Will you never leave me?
Do you, do you need me?
Will you make me so happy
for the rest of my life?
Will you take me away?
Will you make me your wife?
Do you love me?
Will you love me forever?
Let me sleep on it
Will you love me forever?
Let me sleep on it
Oh, will you
love me forever?
Couldn't take it any longer
Lord, I was crazed
When the feeling came upon me
like a tidal wave
Started swearing to my God
and on my mother's grave
That I would love you
to the end of time
I swore
I would love you
till the end of time
Ah ah ah
So now I'm praying
for the end of time
To hurry up and arrive
'Cause if I gotta spend
another minute with you
I don't think that
I could really survive
I'll never break my promise
or forget my vow
But God only knows
what I can do right now
I'm praying for
the end of time
That's all I can do
I'm praying for
the end of time
So I can end
my time with you
It was long ago
and it was far away
It never felt so good
And it was so much better
It never felt so right
Than it is today
And we were glowing
like the metal
Better than it is today
It was so long ago
And it was so much
better than it is today
Ai-yi-yi-yi
It was long ago
It never felt so good
And it was far away
It never felt so right
And it was so much better
than yesterday
Felt so right
Felt so good
Paradise.

If you've come to mess with my head,
don't worry, I'm not going out there.
We came to wish Unique luck
and give her this flower
Well, Unique has left the building.
Try as I might, I can't conjure her.
Wait, this is just stage fright. Think of the
last time you performed as Unique. You were smash.
That was different. Nobody knew Unique. I didn't
have to be any one other than the one I truly was.
Now everyone is coming for me.
Jesse, the rest of my team,
I can't take the pressure.
All I... All I ever wanted to do, was wear
a dress and sing.
And now I'm a poster to every child that's different.
I can't handle it... I just can't handle it.
You may not be able to handle it,
but maybe Unique can.
You gotta move through that fear and expectation.
At least that's what real stars do.
-Aren't we supposed to be enemies?
-Yeah, but that's not how we roll in the New Directions.
Not really our style.
Alright, let me get ready.
Which lipstick?
Ruby red or sugar rose?
Sugar Rose.
Definitely.
You okay?
MERCEDES:
Good luck.
Break a heel.
I'll tell you what.
Unique might need to transfer
schools next year.

Ever since I was a young boy
I played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all
But I ain't seen nothing like

That deaf, dumb and blind kid

He's a pinball wizard,

A pinball wizard's got
such a supple wrist
I don't know
Well, he ain't got
no distractions
Can't hear no buzzes
and bells
Don't see lights a-flashing
He plays by sense of smell
Always has a replay
and never tilts at all
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
sure plays a mean pinball
He's a pinball wizard
There has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got
such a supple wrist
He's a pinball wizard
He's scored a trillion more
A pinball wizard
The world's new pinball lord
He's scoring more
He's scoring more
More, more, more, more
I thought I was
the Bally table king
But I just handed
my pinball crown to him
To him
To him
Yeah-ah-ah-ah...!

I have a confession
to make.
I am a show choir junkie.
Some people
follow football;
some people follow the NCAA
basketball tournament;
some people follow
the daily goings-on
in the life of their
wife and children.
Not me. I follow competitive
high school show choir.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, my God!
Seriously?
Did you blog just about me
during that performance?
You're welcome. It's already
got over three million hits.
And secondly,
if you don't love show choir,
then what exactly are you
doing here, Lindsay Lohan?
If you have to ask
why a 12-time Teen Choice Award
nominee
is a celebrity judge,
then you don't really understand
what the word celebrity means.
I was robbed for
Freaky Friday.
And I'm here, Perez,
because I care
about young artists
chasing their impossible dreams.
I know them.
I feel them.
I was them.
So, I'm here to support them
unconditionally.
Let's get down to business.
We need to narrow our choices
down to the top three.
I, for one, was really moved
by the Scale Blazers'
haunting medley homage
Starlight Express
You must confess
Are you real?
Yes or no?
You know
who I was really impressed with?
The New Directions.
They had so much energy.
It was awesome.
Oh, but gosh, last year
in New York, they choked.
They didn't even
crack the top ten.
I liked them, but they weren't
the best singers and dancers.
They are likable.
And is there anything better
than someone making a comeback?
Please.
The New Directions
were horrible.
Jim Steinman should
never be allowed
to write another song again.
I'm for Vocal Adrenaline
all the way.
I think
that Unique kid is a star.
He's like Tina and
Ike Turner...
Together.
Exactly.
Again.
Just imagine how much
it would mean
to those poor unfortunate
outcast kids
to see him/her
on national television
leading his/her team to victory!
This isn't televised.
What?
This thing isn't
even televised?
I am in full imagery-
rendering mood, people.
I show up here and there's
not even a red button to push?
And a chair that can
spin me around?
Or I can then point
at a kid onstage and yell,
"I would work with you!"
Really? I'm seriously
firing my manager.
Can I use that as an exclusive?
Absolutely not.
This is serious.
These are kids' dreams
on the line out there.
Do you know
what it looks like
when a kid's show choir
dreams are disrespected?
Mm-hmm.
This is what it looks like,
and it really hurts.
We need to vote now.
I need to get back
to my computer ASAP.
The Duggars are pregnant...
again.
Fine by me.
I know who I'm voting for.
What about you, Fonger?
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
five minutes
to our award ceremony.
Please return to your seats.
Excuse me, Ms. Tibideaux.
I'm Jesse St. James, the
coach of Vocal Adrenaline.
I...
I auditioned for you
two years ago.
You said I
showed promise.
And you probably did.
I see hundreds of
people every day.
Good day to you.
No, I'm not here for me.
I heard that you came here
today to see Rachel Berry.
And there's something you
need to know about her.
Rachel's the most talented
person I've ever met.
Bar none.
If anyone's gonna be a star
someday, it's her.
She'll make an excellent
contribution to NYADA.
You won't regret it, I promise.
Anyway, thanks
for your time.
You did "Giants in the Sky"
from Into the Woods.
You ran into obstacles
with your breath work,
and your diction
wasn't crisp enough
to handle what is
arguably Sondheim's
most challenging work.
But your passion and your vocal
range were admirable,
Good luck to you.
ANNOUNCER:
And now it's time to announce
the winner of this year's
individual show choir MVP award.
From Vocal Arednaline,
Carmel High's
Wade "Unique" Adams!
And now a round of applause
to your top three finalists
for this year's National
Show Choir Championship.
In third place...
...all the way from Oregon
the Portland Scale Blazers!
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
quiet, please.
Congratulations to both teams
standing with us onstage.
But not it's time
to announce a winner.
The 2012 National
Show Choir Champions...
...from McKinley High
in Limo, Ohio,
The New Directions.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh.
What could Figgins
want with us?
Maybe we're getting
a key to the city.
FIGGINS:
Prom royalty...
Finn Hudson and Rachel Berry.
Take a seat,
as I only have
a few moments before I must
chastise the cafeteria cooks
for selling our frozen
vegetables on the black market.
As co-captains of
the nationally victorious
New Directions! singing group,
please accept these official
William McKinley High School
bumper stickers
and miniature pom-poms.
Oh, cool.
And though I don't condone
youngsters getting married,
and I wish that everyone
would wait until they were
at least 29 years old,
with solid employment
and a 401k retirement plan,
here's a little something
for your impending
wedding celebration.
Oh, thank you so much.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
And there is one more
item on the agenda:
McKinley is having a very
special event tomorrow,
and I am requesting that
New Directions
singing group perform.
Yeah, we'd love to.
Yeah. Absolutely.
What kind of special event?
Can you keep a secret?
+++++
Ok. Much better.
Ok.
So much better.
So handsome.
And now we're free.
Hooray for double-sided
tape.
Hey.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
Literally.
I just thought you know,
my man is a winner
and he deserves to
be treated as such.
And it was as much for
me as it was for you.
Last night was...
well worth the wait.
But I meant thank you
for everything.
This whole year,
it's been incredible.
And I'm so grateful to
have you by my side.
Many more years to come.
SUE:
Award ceremony's
about to start.
Lots of competition for
teacher of the year.
My source, and when
I say my source I mean
Becky Jackson hiding in
a dummy filing cabinet
that I put in
Figgin's office.
My source said Sue
Sylvester make room
in your trophy case
for yet another accolade.
Let us review why.
I led your tragic band of misfits
to a victory at nationals.
I defeated my
Nubian nemesis.
And of course the Cherrios
welcomed me back with open arms.
And I did all of this without
missing a single day of work
and in spite of the fact
that I've been pregnant now
for indeterminate
number of months.
Sue.
I've gotta give you your due.
No question you helped
us win Nationals
and I know you've had
a tough year but you
never gave up.
You do deserve this.
Thank you William.
Truer words never came
out of your mouth.
Shall we?
Yea.
Why do you look
different?
MRS HAGBERG:
I'd like to thank you all
for forty years of memories
here at McKinley
and I plan on using my
retirement to finally
kick my addiction
to painkillers.
A reminder that my
episode of Intervention
airs at the end
of June
and my Hoarders episode
airs in early August.
Thank you for your support.
Thank you Mrs. Hagberg
go softly into
that sweet night.
+++++
FIGGINS:
And now the award you've all
been waiting for:
Teacher of the Year.
To announce the winner,
please welcome to the stage
so-called Finchel.
FINN:
Hi.
The 2012 William
McKinley High School
Teacher of the Year Award
goes to...
Mr. Will Schuester!
Yeah!
Way to go, buddy.
Wait, just, uh...
before you come up
to accept the award,
we just wanted
to say a few things.
Uh...
Three years ago,
I thought I had it all.
I was the quarterback of
the football team,
I was dating
the head cheerleader.
And then I met you, Mr. Shue,
and I realized
everything I was missing.
There's a lot of great teachers
at this school,
who teach their students
a lot of important stuff,
like how to drive
and-and fractions...
...but you teach your students
how to dream.
As far as I'm concerned,
there's nothing more
important than that.
Mr. Shue...
when I first met you,
I was just an
annoying Jewish girl
with two gay dads
and a very big dream.
Today...
I still have two dads,
and I'm still Jewish,
and I'm probably
just as annoying, but...
I stand before you
headed to New York City
come hell or high water
and, um, I can honestly say
that I couldn't have
done it without you,
and I will carry you
every step of the way, so...
Congratulations.
Um... no one deserves this
more than you.
We love you and...
:
this is for you.
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand
kicked in my face
But I've come through
And we mean to go
on and on and on and on
We are the champions,
my friends
And we'll keep on fighting
till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me
fame and fortune
And everything
that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been
no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge
Before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
And we mean to go
on and on and on and on
We are the champions,
my friends
And we'll keep on fighting
till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world
We are the champions
Champions.
