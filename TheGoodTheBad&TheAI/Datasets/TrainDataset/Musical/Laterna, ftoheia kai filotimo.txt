What are we going to do, guys?
Stand here all day?
- What's the matter?
- Wait a minute! What's wrong?
Your coffee can
is blocking the road...
... and we can't proceed!
- Talk better, buddy!
- Talk better!
You are in the mood for talk
and É'm in a hurry!
Get your things
out of the way!
Wait a second!
Ask us politely...
"May l pass because
l cannot... "
- Hey!
- Take it easy!
- Mind the store!
- Get lost!
Go on!
Shame on you!
Get off, if you're a man!
Get off and É'll tie you into a knot!
Right in your eyes!
- Shall É do it, too?
- É wonder at your delay!
Yes! Wait!
Stop!
Clear the road!
Get out of here!
Hold it!
Let us through!
Go away!
All right!
Ét's no big deal!
Let's go!
What's this fuss!
Let's go! That's
not the place for a barrel organ!
That's the place for a traffic
policeman to start his moves.
Where should we stand?
At a pedestrian crossing?
We'll go where wheels
will never get us.
Let's go!
Look at that! A barrel organ!
- É haven't heard one in years!
- True. They're lost now.
Who knows how
this one was left!
Do me a favour and move over.
We have a sick person here.
All right, sir.
We've stopped.
- They stopped them.
- What a pity!
Come here.
Petros! Look at that
five drachma coin!
- The old man?
- Yes!
Pavlos!
Give it a turn!
Well done!
É'm almost bent like a newspaper.
Wait a while.
Ét's quite heavy.
Don't tell me! É've been carrying it
for thirty years, É know it.
This must be what
they call "heavy music"!
- What will you have?
- Nothing. We'll just rest...
- ... and then we'll go!
- Let us sit for a while.
- Have a smoke.
- Is there another one?
I've got two more.
Petros... Athens is
kicking us out, brother!
It's like it's telling us
loud and clear.
"Dudes", it's saying,
"pack your minor and major keys... "
... "and get out of here".
Right?
- Right!
- We artists are not appreciated...
... like we used to be
some time ago.
- Our work...
- What work?
- Our scam, you mean!
- Say what?
Yes, our scam!
Because if you tell me...
"Sir, you're a lazy dog
and l've had it with you... "
"you're asking too much
to make money doing nothing... "
... I'll say yes.
But my back is killing me!
I've been carrying it
for six hours!
If I'd decided to carry
furniture on my back...
I'd be making money...
- At least 80 drachmas!
- True, but what can we do?
- Change profession.
- Change profession?
How can I do that?
And what would I do then?
Become a doctor? If I were
You have all the time
in the world to change professions...
... and do as you like.
But I can do nothing else.
I was born doing this job,
I'll croak doing this job...
- There's nothing that can be done.
- Yes, there is.
- What's that?
- We can take it...
adorn it with
roses and carnations...
violets and daisies,
take it up to the Acropolis...
let it roll towards
Kind Herod's theatre...
... and then see what happens.
What's the poor thing
done to you?
- It's the world that's changed.
- We should change, too!
- Let's see what we'll do!
- I can't do that.
I can't part with it.
For me it's a living thing.
I talk to it, Petros.
Just saying it, makes me shiver.
I talk to it and it talks back.
"Oh, girl", l say...
... "why are you sad today?"
And I get a reply!
- Get out of here!
- Go to hell!
There's no talking to you!
Don't set foot here
or I'll knock you off!
Shame on you!
Being rough with the kids?
- Welcome, Thodoros!
- Take a seat, Thodoros.
- What are you doing here, dudes?
- We're moping.
- There's no work?
- Not even a penny.
- Hush, We got five drachmas.
- Oh, yes!
A "century" coupled with another
"century" gave us five drachmas!
You see, our music moves
very old people only!
Why didn't give a recital
at the old people's home?
- So there's no money?
- Nothing!
- Why are you here?
- What can we do?
Take the barrel organ
on your shoulders...
... and go somewhere else.
There's money in the countryside.
Would you like to make
Go to Platania!
There's a church of the
Holy Mother up there!
And the Holy Mother's miracle
will make us have money?
No! Listen here...
There's a fete in two days.
Even I will take everything
and go there to make money.
If you're there too when all
the nearby villagers will come...
... your barrel organ
will bring lots of money!
How can we go
when we've got no money?
How? On foot!
- My respects.
- Who are you talking too?
To the colleague. If it
weren't for barrel organists...
... tortoises would be the
unhappiest creatures on earth.
- Come on...
- What is it?
Rest it here to take a breath.
Easy...
I'm like a swastika!
I can't stand up straight!
I started out like a man
and I'll end up crooked!
- Take courage.
- Till when?
Till we get to the church.
There might be a miracle.
The Holy Mother might perform
a miracle for us too.
You know something?
It's cool here...
So why don't
we open two nice pits...
- To do what?
- To get inside and die!
Petros, I've told you that
an artist shouldn't get disappointed.
An artist?
What artist is that?
I've had up to here!
As if we're artists!
Just because we turn the
handle and it plays music?
That's what barrel organs do!
If it were a meat cutter,
we'd get minced meat!
- You're not straight!
- I'm not?
- You're hurting us!
- Hurting you?
You're hurting us and we
artists have suffered greatly!
- I mean to say...
- Excuse me, gentlemen...
Could you please tell me...
... is this the road
to Platania?
- Yes, colleague.
- Are you an artist too, sir?
- Yes, sir.
- A fete artist, too?
- Yes, I'm going to the fete.
- You're on the right road.
Thank you. Good night.
- Farewell...
- That's how artists are!
- Poor soul!
- Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- I'll give you a hand.
- Put it down.
- Why?
- Put it down, man!
- Why?
Put it down, before
you drop a kidney...
... and a dog grabs it!
Listen to me! If Pavlos
is going to come undone...
... he'll go in one piece!
Are we going to talk?
Pavlos... the colleague
is eating!
Maestro! Bon appetit!
Something that is certain!
Thank you! Please, join me!
Thank you. We're going
to rest nearby.
We salute art!
Colleagues! My turn to wish you.
- Bon appetit!
- Don't wish for us.
We'd like to have something
left over for dinner!
Yes, that's true.
Goodbye, then!
- Goodbye, maestro!
- Goodbye!
Farewell, maestro!
Poor soul!
- That's an artist!
- Right.
- Pavlos!
- What is it?
- The girls' school is out!
- Say what?
- Look over there!
- Well, well!
Hello, man! Bon appetit!
Hello, handsome!
Petros, they're like locusts!
- Shall I tell your fortune?
- Don't tell me anything!
You have a good heart.
But heart don't understand.
You love everyone
but you can't find love.
You have something on your mind,
something secret.
I'm full of secrets!
- Your heart is burdened.
- Wrong. My back is!
- It's the same thing, friend.
- No, it's not, friend!
- Cross my palm with silver now.
- Now you're done for it!
- What?
- That "silver" thing, l mean.
If I had money, I'd have crossed
the bus collector's palm...
... and I wouldn't be
communicating with nature!
Keep your arm short!
Leave me alone!
Keep your fingers
far from my pockets!
- Give me some money!
- Give me some, handsome.
Come! Pay me and I'll tell you
what troubles you...
... what you're thinking,
what's on your mind.
lI know what's only mind!
- I don't need you to tell me!
- You have money coming to you!
- To me?
- Yes, to you!
- Where is that?
- On the road.
- Do you know the road?
- Pay me and I'll tell you.
And if you know the road
why don't you pick it up?
- It's waiting for you.
- Forget that.
And you put the tomato down!
- There isn't any!
- Then give me a cigarette.
- We don't have any!
- Can I have half a tomato?
Put the tomato down!
- Can I have some bread?
- You're a pain in the neck!
- Here it is!
- What?
- The money!
- Where is it?
- It's the 8 of hearts.
- What's that?
- Pay me and I'll tell you.
- Pay her and she'll tell you.
- Give the money, you meanie!
- Here it is. Give me the change.
Don't be nasty! Give me five
to learn where to find it.
- Are you sure I'll find it?
- Absolutely sure!
Why don't we go together?
And when I find it
I'll give you some.
Don't touch the organ!
- I'm just touching it.
- You're a strange one!
Hands off!
Enough said, girls!
There's nothing here for you.
We're in the same line of work.
We deal in money, too.
All right, you have no money.
Play a song for us to dance!
That's right,
so we can dance!
Dance?
You're very courageous!
- Come on, old man!
- Yes, old man!
- Play a piece!
- How about a belly dance?
- Go on!
- No songs!
Wait a minute!
You want a song, girls?
- Yes! Give us one!
- To dance to?
- Yes! A belly dance!
- All right.
Come here, Petros.
That's right, put it there
so we can see it!
Come on!
Come on!
Well done, girls!
- Hey! Take us along?
- Can we come up?
Of course!
Come on! Let's go!
- Hey, Pavlos?
- What is it?
Let's ask them
to take us along.
- To climb up there?
- Yes, climb up there.
Let's go!
Friend, why don't
you take us up, too?
- It's at the limit.
- Come on, friend!
Move it!
What can I do, honey?
Maestro... if you were a girl
it would take you.
Let's go, Petros!
- Why don't we sleep a while?
- Why not?
- There's no need to hurry.
- Right. It's just...
- What?
- You know my habit.
I can't sleep if I don't read.
What's there to read?
Shall I give you my certificate
from the army?
I said reading
not studying ancient history.
You're hurting us again,
Mr. Petros.
- Here!
- What?
That's better!
- Look what's happening in the world?
- What is it?
It says, a shipowner's
daughter has disappeared...
... and her father...
Here, read.
I'll read so you can sleep?
You're joking!
Read it. Her father will give
"Shipowner's daughter
mysteriously disappears. "
"Fifty thousand drachma reward.
Fears of suicide. "
lf I were a shipowner's daughter
I wouldn't runn away from home.
And if I were a shipowner
and you were my daughter...
... I'd pay 100,000
so you wouldn't return.
Sleep, because we have
a long way to go!
Excuse me...
Do you have a light?
- I do. Do you have matches?
- ln my pocket. Wait.
- What's wrong with the shoe?
- Pardon me?
- Your shoe.
- Oh... the heel came off.
Give it to me...
What do you think?
Will be he able to fix it?
We'll see.
Something may be done, missy.
Maestro, another
artistic inclination?
An artist cobbler, that is?
You're lucky the young lady
is present!
Never mind me.
Feel free to talk.
- Am I tiring you?
- No, rest, miss.
I'm used to it.
- Where are you going?
- To Platania.
- Oh, to Platania.
- There's a fete there tomorrow...
- And you're going to...
- Yes, "to".
No one knows what will happen...
And you?
I... I?
Yes, if I may...
What brings you here?
Well... that is...
I'm going that way too.
- To Platania?
- Yes... not exactly...
- But that way...
- And how, if I may?
- Your shoe is ready.
- You fixed it already?
- Of course.
- I don't know how to thank you!
It was nothing.
- Well, miss...
- She's also going this way.
This way?
Shall we?
- Why not?
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Excuse me, miss...
- Please.
- I meant to say, that is...
... what brings a girl like you
to this wilderness?
- What is it?
- A spring? I'll have some water!
Who does she look like?
That's what I've been wondering
all this time, man!
- Oops!
- What is it?
- It's the fifty grand!
- What fifty grand?
It's him! The mysterious one!
The daddy! The daughter!
What is it?
There she is! Miracles do happen!
Oh, Lordy!
It's the 8 of hearts!
- What eight of hearts?
- Money on the road!
The gypsies told me!
- An unxpected salvation!
- I should give her money!
- To whom?
- To the gypsy!
Fifty grand drinking water!
That's why she was stiff
when we asked her.
Mother of God, miracle maker!
- Have a care now!
- What?
When she comes, don't ask her
"where do you come from?" and such!
- What are you talking about?
- Don't ask her name, either!
- Of course not!
- The sucker!
And when we find
the first policeman...
... we'll hand her over
and go to collect!
We found a cheque in skirts
along the way!
She's coming... laugh!
Well, missy?
Was that refreshing?
Yes, I was thirsty!
The water was cold, too!
- Well? Shall we?
- Shall we?
Of course, let's go.
And you carry it
all the way?
- How else?
- And it's not tiring?
Miss, if you love the barrel
organ, it doesn't tire you.
And if you don't love it,
it does.
- Do you love it?
- Platonically!
Tell me something, friend.
ls Platania far from here?
- Upper or Lower?
Let's get to Lower first...
- Then we'll see!
- Three hours' walk.
- Only. Thank you!
- Farewell.
Opa!
- It can't be that far.
- The man said so!
Let's ask that one over there.
Tell me something, friend.
How far is it to Platania?
- It's about 6 hours.
- Lower Platania?
- Yes.
- And Upper Platania?
- About eight hours.
- Eight? We were told it's three.
- On the mule.
- Oh, three on the mule!
Hello.
- You heard. Three hours on the mule.
- I heard!
Why did he say on the animal?
Where did he see the animal?
Who was he looking at
when he said it?
Forget the jokes
and let's see what we'll do.
Let's ask those people
to find out exactly how far it.
- No, miss.
- Why?
Because one said three hours,
the other one said six...
... the third will say twelve!
- It's getting dark!
- There's no way...
... we can get to Platania
this evening.
- Did you have to be there tonight?
- No, the fete is tomorrow.
We don't want to stay
out on the road, man!
Where are we going
to spend thenight?
Don't worry, miss!
We'll think of something.
The mattress is a bit stiff,
but it's just for one night.
Don't worry about me.
I'm not going to sleep.
- Why?
- Because.
I'd rather spend
this night sitting here...
Oh, no! Rest for a while.
We'll be on the road
bright and early.
Yes, but that's not enough
to make someone sleep.
Perhaps but I know
I won't be able to sleep tonight.
I may never sleep again!
Or rather, I might
sleep once and for all!
Of course, you don't know
what might be wrong with me.
- How could we know?
- We don't know...
- ... nor do we want to know.
- You might be curious.
- No!
- Not at all!
I mean... you might have thought,
"What's this girl... "
"... doing all alone in the
wilderness at night?" Right?
We, miss Katie...
How do you know my name?
- I didn't say any names?
- You did! You said "Katie"!
- "We, miss Katie", you said!
- l said "Katie"? You're wrong!
No, miss, you misunderstood!
He didn't say "Katie".
You said, "a girl all alone
at night"...
and the maestro here didn't
say "we, miss Katie"...
He said "miss,
although we don't know you... "
... "we're not curious
to know this and that. "
- Is that what you meant?
- Yes, brother!
Besides, the priest says
that in church.
He says "Praise the Lord!"
Why should we care? Right?
Of course!
So you name is Katie?
- Yes...
- Oh!
Come and lie down, miss Katie.
Don't worry about
falling asleep.
We'll lull you to sleep
with the barrel organ.
- This is your bedside table.
- And this rock is the pillow?
- Just don't play pillow fighting.
- Never fear.
- I can't even lift it.
- It's a hard pillow...
... but we'll see if
we can soften it a little.
Try to lie down.
Great!
Are you all comfortable?
- Let's say I am!
- Would you like anything else?
- No, thank you.
- Then... goodnight.
Goodnight.
Didn't you say you'd lull
me to sleep with the barrel organ?
- Right away! Maestro, I want you.
- What is it?
Put that waltz.
And you know now...
- Easy does it!
- Yes...
- Softly.
- Yes...
- Like a lullaby.
- Done!
She's asleep...
Man, first time I lull
to sleep fifty grand!
Yes, but you almost
ruined everything...
... with that "miss Katie"
you said earlier.
I'm only human! It slipped!
It slipped, but the 50 grand
nearly slipped from our hands!
Yes, but we fixed it!
Didn't we?
Wasn't I good
with the priest thing?
Praise the Lord...
She won't wake up now.
She's fast asleep!
Shall we go to sleep?
Why not?
Boy, what a windfall!
What's the matter?
I slipped!
- Why don't you get up?
- What for?
I fell here, I'll sleep here.
If you said, get up...
... to lie in bed,
I would accept that.
But there's no reason to get up
and lie down elsewhere.
That's right.
Boy, what a windfall!
- What windfall?
- The fifty grand!
Do you know what fify grand is?
Fifty grand is...
... fifty grand!
- Isn't it?
- Yeah!
When we get it,
let's turn it to five drachma coins!
- Five drachma coins?
- Yes!
- What will we do with that?
- We'll count it every evening.
- And we'll pass the time!
- Goodnight!
Bona notte, maestro!
Pavlos!
Pavlos! Wake up!
- What's up?
- Get up!
- What is it? Telegram?
- It's the fifty grand!
- What fifty grand?
- The girl! Eight of hearts!
- So?
- She's run away!
- She's what?
- She's run away!
Why are we sitting here?
- That's why I woke you up!
- All right, easy!
- The barrel organ?
- Forget it!
- The fifty grand is gone!
- Let's go!
- Which way did she go?
- That way!
Where the hell is she?
I can't see her anywhere!
Let's listen!
- What are you doing?
- I've seen it in the movies!
That's who lndians
listen to horses.
- Oh! Oh!
- Did you hear anything?
No! An ant got into my ear!
Get out of here!
Where is she?
Vanished into thin air?
Nah! She's on the road
going far away.
No way! We'd see her that way.
She's somewhere around here.
- And we'll lose the organ!
- Why?
We won't find our way back.
We should have used breadcrumbs!
As if we'd get lost!
- How do you explain this?
- What?
- Her flight.
- Who knows?
She may have realised
we know about her.
What was that church stuff?
- You think that's to blame?
- Probably!
Wait!
What do you think?
Shall we use her name?
Why not?
Wait a second... Take a breath.
- No shouting! Nice and easy.
- What do you mean?
Politely. Watch me.
Miss Katie... miss Katie...
Watch me. Miss Katie...
Miss Katie...
- Man! I see her!
- You do?
- Three grand from the fifty!
- Where are they?
- There they are!
- Man!
Let's surround her...
- Let's go!
- Take it easy!
- All right!
- Take it easy!
All right!
Oh!
Long time no see, they say
Right?
- What do you want?
- Nothing.
- Do we want anything, maestro?
- What could we want?
- Do you want anything?
- I want you to stop chasing me!
- We're chasing you?
- Of course you are!
Don't you think I saw
you running to find me...
... like hound dogs?
Maestro looks a little like
a pit bull but don't fear him.
- He doesn't bite.
- If you're not chasing me...
... as you say,
why were you calling me?
- We called?
- What did we say?
"Miss Katie! Miss Katie!"
Or is it the matins...
... and you were chanting?
You misunderstood!
If we were calling your name...
it was simply to see
if you had lost your way...
- Of course!
- I misunderstood, eh?
- Of course!
- Very well!
- I apologise then!
- Don't mention it...
- Thank you for taking care of me.
- It was nothing, you're welcome.
And goodbye!
Why are you following me now?
We're not following you, missy.
- You're not?
- No!
We simply happened
to be going this way...
- Oh, so that's it!
- Of course...
All right. Go your way then
because mine is this way.
What now?
- We didn't...
- You have nothing to say! Right!
Rather all that's left to say
is the truth!
Come on, then!
To make things easier
for you... here you are!
It fell of the pocket
of one of you!
And it helped explain
your taking care of me!
Well? What are you
thinking of doing now?
How you will grab me
and where to turn me in...
... to receive the
thirty pieces of silver!
- Is it thirty now?
- Hush!
Wasn't it fifty?
Let's not go back on that!
Here I am now! Grab me!
Why so hesitant? Are you afraid?
You have nothing
to fear from me.
You're two men and
I'm just a girl!
- Listen, miss...
- What's left to say?
What can we all say?
You won't convince me
no matter what you say.
And nothing I say
will move you.
You don't see me as a person,
but as a money bag!
- You've got it wrong, miss.
- And I'm telling you...
that if you read in the papers
the money would be 100,000...
... to deliver my dead body,
you'd have killed me already!
Is that the kind of people
you think we are?
- Yes, that's it...
- I repeat what I said earlier!
- You've got it wrong!
- Yeah, right...
We are poor people
and for us 50 grand...
... is like a magical dream!
But even without the money,
as honest people...
to whom fortune brought
a crazy girl...
aren't we obliged
to take her by the ear...
back to her parents
who are mad with worry...
because she's gone? You think
that without the fifty grand...
... we'd say "Let her rot"?
And we'd have left you
all alone in the wilderness...
- ... to be eaten by jackals.
- You've got us wrong, miss.
The first thing we want
is your own good.
And you think that
can be found at home!
Where else?
In the glens and dells?
You're wrong! And l'm no
the crazy girl you think l am.
My leaving home
couldn't be helped.
- Why not?
- It couldn't have.
My father is
one of those people...
... who see everything
in life as business.
Ten days ago l was happy.
I loved him and he loved me.
Of course, he wasn't
a shipowner's son.
But he was a good man.
Honest, educated...
and he had worked
his way up to a good post...
... in my father's company.
- Good evening.
- Mr. Benardis, I'd like...
- To explain...
- Tomorrow, son. Tomorrow.
Come, Katie.
We'll talk in the office
tomorrow. Let's go.
Not a word! The following afternoon
when I knew father would be out...
... I ran to the office to find Dimitris
and learn what they'd talked about.
- Mr. Lambrakis?
- He was transferred, miss.
To Patras.
- Transferred?
- Yes.
- Take a seat, Mr. Kordianides.
- Merci.
I waited thirty minutes for you.
I could have waited
half a century!
I don't know if they told you,
but daddy will be late today.
Oh, that's better!
We can talk about us.
- About us? What do you mean?
- Listen, miss Katie...
You must have realised
how I feel about you.
I told your father about
my feelings for you today.
And he made me realise
he wouldn't object...
My father may not object...
... but I do!
You do?
"Yes, I do! In a nutshell,
Mr. Kordianides... "
"don't insist... "
... "because you are wasting
your time and your breath. "
- You told him that? Straight?
- Yes.
- What did the dude do?
- What could he do, man?
He put down his head...
... and slunk quietly away. Right?
Right...
But my father is not the
person who gives up easily.
When he's got something on his mind,
he doesn't change his mind!
And, it seems, he was
fond of the idea...
... of me marrying that fool.
At first he was gentle.
"My girl" and all that.
"He's got so many ships!
He's got such a fortune!"
"He's got so much money!"
Then he changed tactics.
"You'll marry him!"
"I won't!"
"You'll marry him!"
"I won't!"
"You will!"
You hear me?
You'll marry him!
You'll marry him
willy nilly!
You're wrong if you think
I'll leave to the clutches...
of fortune hunters! I haven't
worked as hard as I have...
I haven't nearly
drowned in the seas...
so that any given Dimitris
will find it all ready...
... pretending to be cute
and in love!
You're wrong! Dimitris didn't pretend
to be cute or in love!
And I won't allow you
to talk to me like that!
- What was that?
- What you heard!
Oh!
That was it! I left
the house that very night!
But you took it too far!
- What do you mean?
- He is your father, after all!
If you push him too far,
he's going to be stubborn!
These things require diplomacy.
If l were you,
I'd do it differently.
- What's that?
- I'd go to his office...
knock on his door,
all polite like...
Yes?
- Thank you, child!
-
What would the old man
say to me then?
"No, he's goodlooking
and you'll marry him?"
And if he did, I'd still
be politely pushy.
And in the end
I'd have got my wish.
You don't know my father,
that's why you're talking like that.
For him, words like heart,
emotion, love are foolish words.
There's only one serious word
for him. The word "money".
He esteems people according
to the money they have.
He's divided people
into two categories.
Those who have money
and those who don't.
He appreciates the first
and despises the others.
And... why am I telling
you all this?
- Why should you care?
- Tell me something...
What happened
to that young man?
Dimitris? I told you,
he was transferred to Patras.
He hasn't written?
He hasn't sent word?
- Nothing...
- He just vanished?
- Just like that...
- And now, miss Katie...
if I may, let's say
that we are not...
the cannibals you take us for...
and let's say we forget
the fifty grand and tell you...
"You may go", what will you do?
Where will you go?
- I don't know...
- What does that mean?
That's not right.
Are you to wander the fields?
- Yes, I will just wander.
- Till when?
Until I find the courage
to stop.
And if we take
you back home, let's say?
Then I'll find that
courage sooner!
Stop crying.
Crying doesn't help.
Stop crying
to see what's to be done.
We all know
what's to be done.
You'll turn me in
to the first policeman...
He'll turn me over
to my father.
You will collect the
fifty grand and I...
I'll do what I will.
What's left for me to do...
That's not right, missy.
Unfortunately, I don't
have fifty grand.
If I did, I'd say
"Here's the fifty grand... "
... "let me go in peace!"
You see, I don't have the money
to buy my freedom.
Just a minute, girl!
Isn't that laying it a bit too thick?
Who do you think we are?
Bandits and kidnappers?
We just...
What?
- Policemen...
- Oops!
- This is it!
- Go!
- What?
- Leave, scram!
Go away, dearie!
- Maestro...
- What?
- The eight of hearts...
- What about it?
It's become the joker
and goes wherever it wants!
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello. We're fine.
- Is there water in the well?
- Yes, but there's no bucket...
... no rope either...
- Is there a spring nearby?
- Yes, not far from here.
And further down the road...
- Goodbye, guys.
- Farewell!
- Let's go, Pavlos.
- Let's!
Imagine if a person
crept in...
... stole the barrel organ
and left us speechless!
Look at that!
- What are you doing here?
- Where else would I go?
Yes, but we have to leave.
I know.
Where will you go?
Can I come with you and
help you carry the organ?
No, no, it's heavy.
Too heavy. Nothing to do
with "light music".
Really? Then the stool!
The stool requires
a technique in handling.
What about the timbrel?
Our colleague is working!
I've heard of chamber music.
But I'd never heard
of field music!
They are a lively bunch.
Why don't we tag along?
- Let's go, but...
- What?
We don't want anyone to recognise her
and expect to cash in on it.
- I'll say she's my niece.
- And who will buy that?
They'll see how she's dressed,
see the uncle's clothes...
... and start making fun of us!
I can stay here
and wait for you...
... until you finish work.
Let's go! With all they've
drunk by now...
... they don't know even each other.
Let's go and we'll try...
to find you a skirt
and a blouse from the gypsies.
- It'll be camouflage!
- Let's go.
All right!
Well done, maestro!
You're great!
Thank you!
And now play zeibekiko
so I can dance!
Sit down now!
- Sit down!
- Leave me alone!
Phew!
Irene! Make sure he
doesn't get the upper hand!
Maestro! A zeibekiko!
- Alas I don't know zeibekiko.
- You don't know?
- No.
- What sort of violinist are you then?
You don't play the violin!
You play children's games!
- Aren't I right?
- Let's go! The man doesn't know!
- Leave me alone! I'm dancing!
- Come on!
- I'm dancing!
- Good morning.
You will allow us to play
a zeibekiko for the gentleman...
... to give our esteemed
colleague some time to rest.
- How are you, sir?
- Fine. How are you?
- A zeibekiko, then, right?
- Yes, maestro! I could kiss you!
No! This is the maestro!
I'm like the external
broadcasting agency.
A heavy one, right?
Come on now!
Leave me alone!
I'm dancing!
Leave him alone, missus.
Begging your pardon.
He's a man, after all.
He'd like to dance.
- The song says so, too.
- What song?
Pay attention.
Maestro?
Oh, maestro!
I could kiss you!
Say it like it is, maestro,
so some people can hear!
Well done, Manolis!
You tough guy!
Well done, Manolis!
Well done!
Bravo, Manolis! Sit down!
Well done, maestro!
Say, maestro?
Write it down so I tell
her three times a day.
Sit down!
"You'll do as you like!"
Look how much money
I got for you!
This way, you will be able
to collect the fifty grand on your own!
To your good health!
May God be with you!
Amen!
- Have something to eat.
- Thank you!
- And now you're off to the fete?
- That's how we artists are!
Migrating birds!
- All right, then?
- All right.
- It's to be done now.
- Yes, now.
On the way to Platania...
... is where the men
have put up camp.
Got it? Blouse, skirt,
headkerchief and purse.
Yes, everything. But I'll get
all the girl is wearing.
- Everything.
- The purse, too.
- Yes, that too.
- You'll get the purse, sister!
Do you want anything from me?
- Come on, girls! What's going on?
Make haste!
We've got people waiting!
Goodness, what are they!
The girl is ready. She's coming.
How do I look?
Great! You should
have your picture taken...
... and have the negative
framed at once!
- Why the negative?
- You'll be whiter there!
Here I am!
- Look at me!
- You're fine!
- It's like the carnival!
- You're fine! Grab the timbrel.
Go on!
- Are you coming?
- I'll be there later.
She's like a gypsy.
It's ever so nice!
lt's so nice!
She gave you everything?
You look like a lady!
Step right in! The act
that Ali Khan admired!
Step right in!
The show is about to start!
It's not a monster! We fished it
off Korea! Step right in, gentlemen!
Join the original
American game!
See the game
that Rashtafari invented!
Ten rings with one drachma!
See how lucky you are!
Give it a try, sir!
Use your strength!
Your hands, please!
Go on!
All right, guys!
Let's work!
Here it's every man
for himself.
That's it!
I bid you goodbye,
esteemed colleagues.
- I wish you good earnings.
- Farewell. Likewise.
- Thank you, thank you...
- May you make much money.
Step right in, sirs!
Let me give you a ticket!
The show is just
about to begin!
Try it, ma'am!
Step right up! Big prizes!
The game Rashtafari invented!
Test your strength!
That's it! Wow!
What her husband will go through!
One at a time! Don't push
at the cashier's!
One at time! There's room for all!
All will see and applaud!
Step right in, sir!
Ask those who saw it!
Amazing, gentlemen!
Is it any good?
Handsome, you have
a secret worry.
You have a good heart,
but nobody understands it.
Hi, guys!
Holy Mother of God!
Cheers, Sotiris my brother!
Cheers, Vagelis!
And whoever wants to harm us...
Opa!
Let the coal burn!
Opa, my girl!
Who's got a rifle
to shoot at my itch?
Well done!
More!
Step right in
to the game Rashtafari invented!
Yes, sir! Here you are!
Another one, step right up!
Great prizes!
I'll get your change, sir!
I see money on your way.
Here it is! Eight of hearts.
Don't be a meanie!
Give me five drachmas...
... and I'll tell you where to find it!
Don't be mean! Cough it up!
That's it, miss!
Well done!
Imagine if she were
your mother-in-law!
- Your identity card.
- I don't have any.
- You don't?
- No!
- Then come with me.
- Why should I?
- Come with me!
- No way.
Leave me alone!
Look! He's taking her!
I don't want to!
- I'll see what's going on!
- Sit down! You'll go nowhere!
- Maestro, we're leaving!
- Why?
- I'll tell you.
- Buddy, play a chasapiko.
No can do.
Five-minute break!
- Leave the girl!
- Quiet!
- I'll take you all in!
- What have I done to you?
- Have I done anything?
- We want to ask you something!
Why not ask her here?
- Do you want to know your fortune?
- Yes, say it!
I'll take you all in!
Take care, mister,
or I'll rip your hair out!
Here it is, man!
I was right!
- What does it say?
- What is it?
and so on, and so forth...
In other words...
Thank you...
- You were saying...
- That policeman...
... did not arrest the gypsy,
but Katie's clothes.
Thank goodness you
weren't wearing them!
- What will they do to her?
- What they'll do?
They'll have her
tell them everything.
They'll say "come here, you.
Where did you find these clothes?"
We exchanged clothes
with the girl, I told you!
You gave her yours
and took hers.
Yes.
- Where did this take place?
- At our tents.
And the girl is now
dressed as a gypsy.
Yes!
- All right, it's enough.
- What for?
First, we'll buy Katie
a new dress...
- New camouflage.
- Is that right?
- What?
- Spending money on me!
I know you don't have
money to spare.
That's why we don't care.
Money counts the moment
you have enough to spare.
- Isn't that right, maestro!
- Yep, that's right!
- You said "first".
- Say what?
For the dress. You said
"we'll buy Katie a dress first".
- And then?
- Then, we'll split.
- We'll do what?
- Oh, you don't know Greek!
We'll split... we'll vamoose...
We'll be gone in a jiffy!
- You'll tell me everything!
- I have told you everything.
And these barrel organists
are here in Platania?
Yes, in the square.
They're at Pikoulas'.
- Paterakis!
- Yes, sir.
Go to the square
outside Pikoulas'!
There are two barrel organists
and a girl in gypsy clothes.
- Bring them all here.
- Yes, sir.
Bring everyone here at once!
You sit down.
Is that Athens?
Hello, Athens? This is
Platania police station.
Give me the headquarters.
I want Mr. Trampas.
Hello? Yes, speaking.
Oh, right! And you have
her now? Good...
Is it certain the missing
girl is in the area?
Good... yes,
keep them all there.
All of them! The barrel
organists, too! Yes... no.
I'll be there myself.
Goodbye.
Hello? Yes, speaking.
How are you, Mr. Trampas?
What was that?
What? She's alive then?
Praise the Lord!
- What was that?
- Tomorrow morning...
... I'm thinking of going
to Platania personally.
Yes, you can come along.
Tomorrow morning at nine.
Goodbye.
What? In your car.
Yes, goodbye.
- Yes, they were here.
- How long ago?
- Half an hour. Right, Vagelis?
- Half an hour, twenty minutes ago.
- Where did they go?
- In that direction.
Thank you.
I don't know if it's to your taste,
because, to tell the truth...
... I've never dressed
a shipowner's daughter before!
- May you do even better!
- Thank you, likewise.
- It's very nice, indeed!
- I don't if it's nice or not...
That's it, though!
Find a spot
to change clothes...
... because we're leaving
in ten minutes!
- Where to?
- Patras!
- Did he say Patras?
- Yes!
Oh!
Easy... easy...
- It's too much.
- 250 drachmas is too much?
- It's too much, man!
- Do you know how far Patras is?
Do you know how many two drachma
coins make 250 drachmas?
How much do you wish to spend?
Let's not haggle
like rich men...
I'll give you 200 drachmas.
All right?
All right. I'll get petrol
and we're rolling.
You know where to find us.
At Tsotras' basement.
- Yes, I know.
- Don't be late.
All right.
How do I look?
You look great, girl!
I can say nothing more!
It's very nice. Look sharp!
We're leaving in two minutes.
I'll stand outside
and when the wheels come...
... I'll whistle and you come out.
All right?
All right...
- Hey, you!
- Yes, sir... ?
Have you seen two
barrel organists here?
- Two barrel organists?
- Yes.
Two barrel organists
with an organ.
Oh... two barrel organists
with an organ.
- There was a girl with them.
- Oh, two barrel organists...
... with an organ and a girl!
- A girl dressed as a gypsy!
- Oh! Two barrel organists...
... with an organ and a girl
dressed as a gypsy!
- Yes!
- I haven't seen them.
- Say so, man!
- I'm saying, sir...
Let's go, maestro!
You wait here.
I'll be right back.
- What will you tell him?
- Why should you care?
- What will he tell him?
- He knows what.
He's good at talking.
Come here, you!
Move it!
- Didn't I say not to come here?
- We haven't been here, officer!
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Mr. Lambrakis, please?
- Mr. Lambrakis is not here.
- Where is he?
- He's in hospital.
- In hospital? What for?
- Poisoning.
- What happened?
- That's how the young are.
They easily become enthusiastic
and equally easily disappointed.
- Which hospital is he in?
- The City hospital.
- Mr. Georgiadis, please?
- ln 43.
- Here it is, No 30.
- May I see him?
Of course! He's perfectly well.
He'll be discharged today.
He could have been
discharged yesterday.
- May I come in?
- Yes, please.
That's how it is, Dimitris.
Men...
I mean, real men
and not half men...
instead of swallowing
quinine and aspirin...
... strike hard until
they get what they want!
- Who are you?
- Your new father-in-law!
Who?
Let's see what the owner
of the vehicle will say.
- Have you sent for him?
- Yes, sir.
You shouldn't worry,
Mr. Benardis.
We're on their trail now.
It's impossible
to lose them now.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Trampas.
What I don't understand...
... is what my daughter is doing
with these two punks!
I'm afraid she's not following
them of her own free will.
I fear this is a kidnapping.
- They will ask for ransom!
- I don't think that's right...
All we interrogated, the violinist,
the gypsies, everyone...
confirmed that your daughter...
... seemed rather happy with them.
I don't believe...
And if it's like you said...
... she'd have run away.
She had plenty of opportunities.
No, no!
Yes?
Come here, you!
Take off your hat!
- To the Major!
- Tell me now...
Where did you take the barrel
organists with the gypsy girl?
- What gypsy girl?
- Wasn't there...
... a girl dressed
as a gypsy with them?
There was a girl,
but not a gypsy.
Not a gypsy?
Take a look... is that her?
Yes.
- Where did you take them?
- To Patras.
To Patras? Then I know
where we can find them!
We must only be on time...
May they live long
and prosper!
- Who?
- They!
And may we also
get married!
And for us,
may we have a good old age!
You do have many ships!
You can give a little one
to grandchild to play with!
You're an artist too, man!
An artist is not the one
who plays the violin or the flute.
The artist is in the heart!
You're an artist
without an instrument...
... like a minister
without a portfolio!
You're laying it on
rather thick, maestro!
Shedding a tear
makes me an artist?
Cooks cry all the time
when peeling onions!
Never mind.
- Drop... drop...
- 4, 331... 4, 332...
- Drop... drop...
- 4, 333... 4, 334...
This is music!
- Maestro...
- What is it?
- Five drachma break.
- What?
- I meant, five minutes!
- Why?
- Time for five-drachma coin therapy!
- I don't understand.
The five-drachma coin
shower, we discussed?
Oh! Oh, man,
it's so refreshing!
Oh! Oh!
It's so refreshing, man!
Poor barrel organ!
Remember when you said
we should throw it away?
