ln the name of Preverti,
daughter of the mountains
whose embrace with Rani
made the whole world tremble.
Tremble!
Tremble.
Whose name is the Terrible.
Whose name is Baleful.
Whose name is lnaccessible.
Whose name is the Black Mother,
mother of darkness.
Kaili!
We turn our hearts to Kaili,
Drinker of blood, Black Mother.
Kaili!
Killer of demons,
gorge on this flesh, our offering.
- Drink...
- Halt!
- Halt?
- The ring.
She is not wearing
the sacrificial ring.
She cannot be sacrificed
without the ring.
Where is the ring?
What has she done with the ring?
The ring! The ring!
Help! l need somebody
Help! Not just anybody
Help! You know l need someone
Help!
When l was younger,
so much younger than today
l never needed anybody's help
in any way
But now these days are gone
l'm not so self assured
Now l find l've changed my mind,
l've opened up the doors
Help me if you can
l'm feeling down
And l do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back
on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
And now my life has changed
in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish
in the haze
But ev'ry now and then
l feel so insecure
l know that l just need you like
l've never done before
Help me if you can
l'm feeling down
And l do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back
on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

Ooh
- Oh, shocking.
- Monstrous.
- Ahme.
- The necessary preparations...
- The preparations for my departure...
- Are made.
- At once, without delay.
- The ring.
Over the water we must go.
- Bhuta.
- You ask of me, Master?
- Obedience and Love.
- This is so.
- Ahme.
- This is so.
- The ring.
- Has nobody looked on the washbasin?
l am making the immediate
arrangements for my necessary...
- Are made.
- At once.
- ...visit to England.
- ln hand.
Something must be done.
Without the ring,
there will be no sacrifice,
without the sacrifice,
no congregation.
Without a congregation...
...no more me.
This is so.
- Wave.
- l don't like to.
- Go on, wave.
- Shall l?
They expect it, don't they.
Lovely lads and so natural.
Adoration hasn't gone to their heads.
You know what l mean, success.
So natural and still the same
as they was before they was.
- Someone's got hold of my finger.
- You trying to attract attention again?
She's pulling at it.
Oh!
Ow!
She had my finger, you know...
Stop trying to drag things down
to your own level.
l thought she was a sandwich
until she went spare on my hand.
lt's cold. lt's a cold place.
- So, the ring?
- No. l could not get it off, Swami.
Oh dear!
Hey! Have you been messing with me
in my kip?
l mean, with a fishing rod.
l wouldn't touch you with a plastic one.
What are you doing on the floor?
l'm tired.
- Hello?
- Hello?
Hey, Bea-atle!
How about this,
Gold! All of it, pure gold.
ln easy to handle
denominational nuggets. Unmarked.
- Not a mark on them.
- No, l hate them.
- No.
- lt makes your fingers go green.
lt's not the Beatle with the ring.
- Aren't l?
- No, unfortunately.
Ah!
Hey, Bea-atle.
You shall have fun, eh?
No thanks, l'm rhythm guitar
and mouth organ.
l didn't encourage that wink.
- lt is not the one.
- My gosh.
They all look the same in their similitude
and language.
Swami, it's raining on your...
After them.
- Quickly, quickly.
- Yes, yes.
- Right, right.
- All in.
- All in together now, sir.
- Now.
- Ah! Shilling!
- Shilling?
- Shilling.
- Oh, shilling!
- Now! Off!
- Off.
Oh... After them.
- What first attracted you to me?
- Well, you're very polite.
Ha, ha!
Hope he's in.
Ow!
- What are you doing?
- Posting a letter.
Ow!
Ow!
l am not what l seem.
Hey! My skin's soaked right through
to the skin.
There's more here than meets the eye.
- Ho, ho!
- Ho!
- Ho, ho!
- Ho!
- Ho, ho, ho!
- Oh!
- Ho!
- Ho, ho!
Take Five.

- Boys, are you buzzing?
- No thanks, l've got the car.
No, listen...
You'll have to do it again.
' l'll make a point
of taking her away from you
' Watch what you do,
yeah
' The way you treat her,
what else can l do...  '
- ls that you?
- No.
-
- Don't look at me.
lt was you buzzing.
You naughty boy.
Now for the ring!
Ow!
Oh! Oh, that stings.
Kaili!
Kaili!
Flee!
Will you explain everything
when the opportunity presents itself?
- Flee!
- OK.
Oh, goodness me!
Sex is creeping in.
Young people see it in the bazaars,
market places, temple...
No wonder they turn up their noses
at a mystical impulse...
We're taking up fox hunting so young
people are involved in their sacrifices.
and will understand the deep
significance of blood well shed.
Of course l don't expect you to see
eye to eye with me...
What? Who? Where?
Now... lf you'll pardon me.
lt's played out, any road?
You know, rings...
- Very nice.
- lt's yours.
Nah! My missus wouldn't wear a ring
like that. Ostentatious, that is!
- He's from the west.
- Nah, east. Stepney.
- Does this ring mean anything to you?
- Freemason?
- You're all English!
- That's what unions are for.
l tell a lie. We have got one in there
from the mystic east... Or we did have.
Hey, Abdul!
- Yes.
- We did have one, didn't we?
That lad from the sunnier climate,
east of Suez?
Very nice he was, too.
l think he's still down there,
in the coal hole.
Doesn't the blood rush to your head, sir?
Doesn't the eastern flavour
come expensive?
Doesn't the blood rush to your stomach?
ls this ring nasty, sir?
Argh! Kaili! Oh dear, l must lie down.
Oh! That's better.
Excuse me...
This menu...
l've just seen the most amazing thing...
Oh...
Hey, did you...
There's a man down there on his head.
Arthur?
Could you pick this up for me, please?
Are you eating, too, Paul?
Your friend is in mortal danger.
l can say no more.
lt's rather a jolly place.
- Soup, please.
- Soup, yeah.
He has three hours to live.
- Say no more.
- l can say no more.
l ordered soup too.
- Soup!
- Soup.
Pardon me, sir. That's a very
fascinating ring you've got there.
- Unless l'm mistaken.
- ls it?
The dreaded sacred sacrificial
ring of the dread Kaili.
- Say no more.
- l can say no more.
Excuse me. lf he is to be sacrificed
before Kaili,
why is he not painted red?
l've never had the courage to ask him,
but as he's my best friend l will.
- What's this? Glasses?
- That's right, sir. Glasses.
A victim is offered
to the dread Kaili everyday.
All are happy to go.
He who wins is privileged to wear
the sacred ring
from sun to moon,
from moon to sun.
And at the end of the happy day
he is slaughtered jolly with a knife.
And sacrificed jolly with a knife,
so l'm told, with that ring.
Three hours to live.
-  You have till five o'clock.
- Before a new victim is chosen.
You are lucky to be chosen!
My old mum would give her right hand
to be chosen.
- What's this?
- A season ticket.
l like a lot of seasoning in my soup.
There's somebody been in this soup.
l got it from this Eastern bird... lady...
in a fan letter.
l get all sorts.
Rubbish, though, isn't it? Sacrifice.
No? Come off!
So, get in touch with your authorities
and send back the ring to this lady,
who will then go happy to Kaili.
- Thank you.
-  Three hours.
There's a footprint in here.
Here, you have a go.
Flee!
We have lots of little problems like this.
Some of them matrimonial.
This ring is not stone.
- l've only got three hours to live.
- Therefore, it must be a metal.
- l don't know this metal.
- You're not getting anywhere, are you?
Early days yet, sir.
Therefore it must be an alloy.
There's a certain amount of hurry up
involved here. My life is in danger.
Three ten.
- The wheel.
- Not the wheel.
Even the Royal House of Hanover
had the wheel, sir.
- l've never seen anything like it.
- You've failed.
- l suggest you see a specialist.
- What kind? Your tools are broken.
The fire brigade once got my head
out of some railings.
- Did you want them to?
- No. l left it there when not at school.
You can see a lot of the world
from railings.
l like operations,
they give you a sense of outlook.
This won't work.
lt could work if the government
would spend more money.
Made in America you see.
Another failure.
The idea is...
The idea as l see it
is that we expand the molecules
and the ring grows bigger and drops off.
- What's your electricity bill like?
- lt's sort of a long counterfoil.
lt's not dropping off.
Voltage!
Voltage...up, up...
Up, up!
- Are you sure l'm earthed?
- Oh no, hold on. Thank you.
Made in America.
Streets ahead of anything we've got.
This is English.
- ls it green, the earth in America?
- ln some places it's brown.
He's not earthed.
He's an idiot.
Has a degree in woodwork. l ask you!
Done.
- 5... 4...
- Come on.
He'll thank me for it in the end.
Scientist, you're getting nowhere.
lt's the plugs.
Good British plugs.
All this America rig. Wrong voltage.
That's what foxes me.
- How do you feel?
- l used to use my hands.
He used to use his hands.
- Will he still be able to drum?
- Did he do a lot of it?
- Voltage...up!
- l'm no mean hand at the old sticks.
The voltage, up, up, up!
- Hey, he's calling you. Up, up, up!
- Up, up, up!
The bunker!
- l can't watch.
- lt's working! Give it the gun, Algernon.
Stop it!
lt's more than my job's worth!
He's out to rule the world
if he can get a government grant.
Outrageous!
You're nothing but a mad scientist!
Fantastic!
With a ring like that l could,
dare l say it, rule the world.
l must have the ring...
Algernon, the laser.
Get your hands off him
or l'll call the Metropolitan scuffers!
The laser...
- Get him off.
- l must have this ring. The laser.
Halt! Release him or l'll shoot
and l am a dead eyeshot shooting.
- l've got it.
- Switch off that machine.
- The laser.
- The laser, yes...
l'm better with animals
than plugs and transistors.
MlT was after me,
wanted me to rule the world for them.
Daddy being the local master
of the hounds.
That's where l get it from,
my love of animals.
They trust me.
l should have been in vivisection.
How do you know we can trust her?
She's had your fingers before, Ringo.
Well, that was a mistake.
l can vouch for her. We're very close.
- Lasers ready.
- Get them!
lt's the wrong plug...
Just give me five minutes.
lt's the brain drain.
His brain's draining.
Here l stand with head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
lf she's gone l can't go on
Feeling two foot small
Ev'rywhere people stare
Each and ev'ryday
l can see them laugh at me
And l hear them say
''Hey, you've got to hide
your love away!''
''Hey, you've got to hide
your love away!''
How can l even try?
l can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
ln the state l'm in
How could she say to me
''Love will find a way''?
Gather 'round all you clowns
Let me hear you say
''Hey, you've got to hide
your love away!''
''Hey, you've got to hide
your love away!''
l have here...
Now see what you've done
with your filthy Eastern ways.
No! lt is Clang, the High Priest,
who is filthy in his ways.
How do we know
you're not sent by him to nick the ring,
when you've lulled us
with your filthy ways?
- What filthy ways are these?
- You can put that away.
Until this moment you were safe
because my sister was chosen
and no other could be sacrificed
to Kaili.
Now my sister is safe and rises up.
'And a new day dawns,
a new victim is chosen...'
From this moment it is death to him
who wears the ring.
This will make your finger shrink.
Be brave.
Don't look.
Alas, if he were brave
this would not be necessary.
Where've you been?
You've been up that temple again.
You're as bad as your sister, coming
home from work at all hours and colours.
There might be some insurance.
l wouldn't think of such a thing!
Find out.
What did you say that stuff is?
This will just make his finger shrink
a little. lt's a minor medical secret.
l'm sure there's no call for all this.
l'm allergic to Penicillin
and all them other wonder drugs.
- Gum?
- Are you sure it's not or habit forming?
No. As long as you don't swallow it.
All right.
Synchronise your watches.
You, you, you and you.
Paint him red and then kill him.
Kaili.
Kaili. Kaili.
l promise you
the effect is purely transitory.
lt wears off very quickly.
Don't answer it! lt's Clang.
- Perhaps it won't take...
- This is a dreadful miscarriage.
Come on, my finger!
Where's Paul?
Where's Paul? Come on, Paul,
stop messing about.
Where's he gone?
- Where are you, Paul?
- lt's his best suit.
Don't look right or left. They might take
us for innocent bystanders.
- Standby.
-  Standby.
Look out!
They're coming through the door!
- Go!
- Go!
Kaili!
Kaili... Oh!
- Sorry, l hit him.
- Oh!
Get me the home office.
He's wrecking my home.
Kaili! Kaili!
Get off!
- lt's me, you fool.
- Oh, sorry.
Well, stop it!
Feet! Feet, you fool!
Kaili! He's red! Kill him!
Oh, my goodness gosh!
Withdraw! Withdraw!
Up!
Up, up, up!
- You!
- Which one has the ring?
That one with the large ned.
Neb!
And it's yours.
- Keep your hands up.
- How can l get it off with my hands up?
ln the name of science
l demand that ring.
lt's yours!
- lt's worth something.
- A couple of bob, at least.
Had to do all this myself... Backward
Britain they call us on Wall Street.
With a ring like that
could l interest the military?
No, l could not.
l can't get it off.
- Paul?
- Look, what you've done.
- Hey, is that Paul?
- Algernon, my little black bag.
l shall have to operate.
lt'll be on the National Health,
won't it?
-
- Look!
Ugh! l'm all sticky. You're all red!
- We thought that was you.
- No that's not me.
l'm glad it wore off quickly.
What are you doing here?
-
- Get out!
British, you see! Useless.
lf l had a Luger...
Their scientists are properly equipped.
Think on it.
The remedy is in your hands...
you, the voters.
- Where's Ahme?
- l don't know.
- Hai?
- What? Yes... Hai.
l don't understand a word.
l don't speak the language.
Latin, yes. But this Eastern babble, no.
Ah, the ring! Come on, we go.
l think l'm gonna be sad
l think it's today, yeh
The girl that's driving me mad

She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket

She's got a ticket to ride

She said that living with me
Was bringing her down, yeh
For she would never be free
When l was around
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket
to ri-hi-hide
She's got a ticket to ride
but she don't care
l don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think twice,
she ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice,

The girl that's driving me mad

There they are!
Ho, ho, ho!
Ho, ho, ho!
Oh...
Wait!
The blood's rushing to my head.
Mind that post!
Put me down.
Put me down.
Thank you...
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
Hey! Over here.
Wait, wait, wait!
Ho, ho, ho!
Ho, ho, ho!
Ho, ho, ho... Oh!
Ah... So!
lt's too heavy!
Here you are. lt's not heavy now.
-  Send it down!
-  Here you are, Ringo.
l've got it... No, l haven't,
it's gone past!
Send this one straight.
l've got it... No, l haven't.
- Look out!
- Get away!
l am easing the fuse in now.
What?
l know, you fool. l'm here.
Steady.
Steady. l am steady.
Now a turn to the right and it locks.
l am turning it to the right.
lt is locking.
That's what comes
of teaching science by TV.
You'll thank me in the end.
l am lifting it up.
- l am moving my left leg...
- Hurry up!
- l am moving my right leg.
- Oh, give it to me!
- Call it a day.
- lt's curling stone day.
When the ice breaks dive straight in.
lt's the right hand.
lt won't work.
Soft game... broom sticks.
Thank you.
Throw it, George.
That was good.
Great.
Hey, it's a thingy.
A fiendish thingy!
lt was so fast, it's smoking.
Run, Ringo!
Useless... ex army rubbish.
l cannot get the equipment...
Excuse me... white cliffs of Dover?
Thank you.
Bhuta, here they come, the right flank.
- Get on!
- Stop here. You're in my power!
ln the name of Kaili, stop!
Stop!
Argh!
My blood group is very unusual.
Look!
My blood group is...
This way, Swami.
What for? Please, no...
Please... No...
l am very busy... please!
Perhaps if we gave away free tickets
to the youth organisation
annual sacrifice,
all this could be avoided.
lt's a very real problem.
London.
Red.
Red?
They have to paint me red
before they chop me.
lt's a different religion from ours...
l think
- So this is the famous ring, eh?
- l'm in fear of my life, you know.
So this is the famous Beatles?
So this is the famous Scotland Yard?
How long do you think you'll last?
You can't say fairer than that.
Great Train Robbery, how's that going?
- You don't believe us, do you?
-
- Chief Superintendent.
-  'Ringo, please.'
- lt's for you, the famous Ringo.
- lt's them.
- Only me and Paul know we're here.
- l know.
Allow me. l'm a bit of a famous mimic.
You know... James Cagney.
Hello, this is the famous Ringo,
what is it that l can do for you?
Not a bit like Cagney.
-  'Go to the window.'
- Hey, it is them!
'Go to the window.'
Go to the window.
Go to the window.
Go to the window.
'Go to the window.'
There's a strong case for arming
the police. We're not all masochists.
- Now see?
- l believe you. Thousands wouldn't.
Right, let's get going.
Pass me the phone, will you?
Lifeline of the service.
Dial 999.
We need protection.
We've got a record to do tomorrow.
- l need protection.
- And you shall have it.
Get me protection.
You don't realise how much

Love you all the time
and never leave you
Please come on back to me

Said you had a thing or two
to tell me
How was l to know

As l looked in your eyes
You told me
Oh yes, you told me
You don't want my loving anymore
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this

l regret losing a lieutenant
as able as Ahme
but she was told the price of capture.
- Enemy tank moving from left to right.
- Loaded.
- Well, fire the nasty thing.
- Firing now,
Missed! You naughty boys.
Turn us right.
Fire!
There must be somewhere in England
where one can find sanctuary to think.
How's your equilibrium, Ringo?
How's yours?
You're light again, George.
- How do you know it's not you.
- Cos l never am, am l Paul?
Here, cop this, one hand!
-  Ugly, though.
- The hands?
- Some people's are.
- Show us your hand, Ringo.
- You want to chuck one in?
- Get on!
- How about drumming, though?
- lt won't affect it.
l don't know many...
lt appears l need one card.
l'm chucking one in.
Very light-hearted.
- Discarding it.
- Like an old boot.
They're talking about your finger,
you know.
One card. Dealer takes one.
See, that didn't hurt.
- Will you hold this drumstick?
- Manchester has a good drummer.
Well, l don't just drum with it, do l?
- What else then?
- l use it, you know.
Quite a good-looking fellow, too.
l'll raise you.
You haven't used that finger
in the past hour and we're in danger.
Me and Paul haven't seen you
use of that finger, have we?
- No.
- And again.
We're risking our lives to preserve
a useless member.
That bloke with Scott,
l've always admired the way he went
into the snow for his mates.
- And again.
- You're joking!
Just hold this drumstick.
You've raised it a little bundle
on the quiet.
- lt's like having a tooth out.
- l've got a good hand.
You only lay out money
is when you've got five aces.
- Do you want to see me?
- You're joking... take it.
l will see... l've won it.
- Cut.
- No!
l think tea, don't you? Tea.
They expect me to cut my finger off.
The famous finger, eh?
So the police are extended
giving the famous protection,
for which we are justly proud
in this country, for a finger, eh?
What's that... lt's haunted, you know.
- Are you going to cut?
- No, l'm not and let that be an end to it.
End to it!
This wing of the palace is haunted.
We won't leave this palace alive.
The Queen will have something
to say about that.
- What's that?
- l beg your pardon?
- That thing coming through his stomach.
- l daren't look!
lt's only a hose.
- lt's for you.
- lt's the gardener.
l'll stick it out the window.
Eyes left.
Eyes front!
Must be their tea break.
Hands up!
Hands up! Quick!
Come on, lets have you.
Steady!
There goes my knighthood.
You, left hand...
Lets have that ring.
lt's me, you fool.
- Quick! Quick!
- Let's catch him!
This should work,
it's from Harvard.
- lt looks like a laser.
- lt's a relativity cadenza.
That should slow them down a bit.
There, point it down the hall.
Quickly!
Hurry up with the plug,
l'll align the sights... Yes!
Right, good.
l think it is a laser.
Oh!
Oh...
A royal fuse has just blown.
- lt is a rela...teva...camenza...
- Bad machine!
Hair dryer, l'll bet
she had one for Christmas.
We are going for a friendly walk
with the police down by the river.
Ooh, look at that.
- lt's a band.
-
Paint! Paint!
Come on, quickly!
Get them, men. l'm with you.
After them! After them! Quick!
Look.
Oh, lovely pub.
Two lagers and lime
and two lagers and lime, please.
- Looks like it's me again.
- Everything's relative, you know.
- Well, you didn't miss your tonsils.
- How do you know?
Why don't you chop it off, Ringo?
Look John, l've had some great times
with this finger.
How do you know l wouldn't miss it?
You're a rat underneath.
You can have a fire and theft policy.
Five quid a week.
lt's because you're a Beatle
that your fingers wasn't on it.
- ls there a cure for nail biting?
-  Oh, yes.
Oh, yes!
l'm always getting winked at these days.
lt used to be you, Paul.
Oh, Sorry Ringo.
Peep boo!
All the rungs have been neatly sawn
in the middle.
Ah, the window!
- Your famous Ringo is safe.
- No, he isn't.
What? Cover all exits.
Sharp lookout.
- Don't move.
- You heard what she said.
Do you know Beethoven's
lt goes like this...
- What?
- This trap door.
Oh, here you are...
Permit me.
lt's Raja, the famous Bengal man-eater
who escaped from the zoo this morning.
- So it is!
- Don't worry, he's harmless.
All you have to do is sing Beethoven's
Ode to Joy from the 9th symphony.
- Why didn't you think of that?
- Raja was reared on the classics.
Don't worry, just whistle famous
Beethoven's famous 9th symphony.
Come on! Come on!
Beep, beep!
Psst!
-  Who let it out?
- Nobody will know.
We're not going there.
- We just put it round we're going there.
- We're not going there.
- We just put it round.
- So everyone thinks we're going there?
- l'd like to go there.
- You wouldn't like it.
- Where are we going?
- Never you mind.
- You're welcome.
- Goodbye, sir.
Him!
- Welcome to Nassau.
- Thank you very much.
l'd like to present PC 1 7...
- PC 6...
- Very smart.
- PC 4 7...
- Uh-huh.
- PC 6 of 3...
- Oh.
- PC 9...
- Hmm.
- PC 85...
- Mmm.
- PC 4...
- Yes.
PC 21 , PC 85...
You should have thought of that
before you left the house.
Left... To shore...
Port, starboard!
For l have got another girl
Another girl
You're making me say
that l've got nobody but you
But as from today,
well l've got somebody that's new
l ain't no fool and l don't take
what l don't want
For l have got another girl
Another girl
She's sweeter than all the girls
and l met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do
what she can do
And so l'm telling you
this time you'd better stop
For l have got another girl
Another girl who will love me
till the end
Through thick and thin
she will always be my friend
l don't wanna say
that l've been unhappy with you
But as from today,
well l've seen somebody that's new
l ain't no fool and l don't take
what l don't want
For l have got another girl
Another girl who will love me
till the end
Through thick and thin
she will always be my friend
l don't wanna say
that l've been unhappy with you
But as from today,
well l've seen somebody that's new
l ain't no fool and l don't take
what l don't want
For l have got another girl
Another girl, another girl
- Let's play a game, eh? Beep-beeps.
- OK.
Beep-beep, beep-beep!
Oh, oh, oh!
Radar's broken! Never mind.
Beatles! Hello!
Port... Starboard... Over there!
Oh, oh, oh!
Ah! A-ha, a-ha, a-ha!
Open that rock!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- ls that it?
- Better watch your fingers, Ringo!
Clang had the whole temple transported
here for your sacrifice.
He needn't have bothered.
Very nice of him, though.
- What's this?
- This is where you'll be disembowelled.
You don't go for all that,
do you?
Keeps you busy, eh?
- Do you know where Clang is?
- l'm his mother and he's a good boy.
l don't want to knock
anyone's religion, but...
- ln here, quick.
-  l can't swim.
l'm not going!
Where have they gone?
- Let's go back and get them!
- l'm game.
- Let's smash them!
- Let's find that temple.
- A man's got to do what he's got to do.
- l don't like running away.
- Let's go back and get them.
- They'll disembowel us.
- Not if l get the boot in first.
- Let's go back and get them.
They won't disembowel us, you see.
That's all gab - disembowelling...
- Signpost.
- Signpost.
- Guide book.
- Guide book.
- Feet.
- Feet? Oh, feet!
Red light.
Kaili!
- Green light, go!
-  Kaili!
The things we have to do
in these heathen countries.
There must be an easier way
to set a trap!
- Easterner speaks with forked tongue.
- What does he say?
Passing this way with hot foot
to the temple.
Don't encourage him!
You've got the part, Paul.
- Dare we ask how you know?
- How! l saw those footprints...
And this guidebook.
- To the temple.
-
After them...slowly!
- That's not it, is it?
- lt's on the map as being here.
That temple under the rock,
that swimming pool that we came up in...
- l'm lost!
- This isn't a temple, is it?
- So this is a famous temple?
- Should be. lt's gone.
l hope that disembowelling thingy
has gone, too.
- Was there ever a temple here?
- Never, sir.
Old army place. Well-known
place of retreat for courting couples
who like the echoes of bugles
as they court.
That's my theory.
Ugh!
- Aren't we going in?
- No, let's not.
Oh, come on lads,
where's that famous pluck?
- l haven't got any. Have you, George?
- Did have.
- l have had.
- l will have.
He's a bit soft that lnspector,
isn't he?
He never takes his hat off.
lt's very hot over here
for wearing a hat.
- l'm off.
- Typical!
Kaili!
Argh!
- Kaili!
- Kaili!
The fiends! They've electrified
the wire with high tension. HT.
The fiends!
Help me!
Help!
He's mine!
Help!
Help me!
There's one on the back,
but it's not the right one.
Come here, boy! Let me explain.
This is no time for foolish tricks!
This is a hired car.
Back up and smash him off.
Now, this will get him!
Oh! Never mind. Try again.
This should give him a headache.
Where's he gone?
- That's done it, he's gone.
- l can't start the car.
-
- Hello.
Oh, hello! Hang on a minute...
On, on!
l seem to be having
a slight difficulty.
To the right! oh...
- l think it might be the wrong key.
- On!
On!
Got it.
Didn't take long, did it?
Thanks for the lift, sailor!
- Where did the thugs go?
- They've vanished.
- He's got a plan.
- A very famous plan.
Superintendent, you've got a plan.
- Yes...
- Superintendent.
l've got a plan.
Ringo!
Ringo!
- Ringo!
- Ringo!
- Ringo!
- Ringo!
Ringo!
Ringo!
All right, talk!
We know he's a prisoner,
but where?
- l'm a perfect surgeon.
- Huh?
- l'm a perfect surgeon.
- He was asked to take it up.
Alas... Scalpel.
Sca...
Sand in the generator.
lt gets everywhere. No wonder
l never get anything done.
Fix it, Algernon.
You wouldn't want me to go in
with a blunt scalpel.
Fix it!
l'm a decent employer,
but he takes advantage of me.
- lt's the heat, it makes him stroppy.
- Luckily.
l've got some juice.
l can't understand it. They kept
pulling my nose. Mine of all noses!
- What's that?
- Distilled from the essence of orchids.
Hands up!
- What's that?
- Distilled from the essence...
Not distilled from the essence of orchids
found only in certain recesses?
At last! l'll have my just reward.
Give it to me! Sir Tiberius Foot Juice!
- But the ring...
- Who needs it now that l have this.
- Do you know what this is?
- A Webley automatic...
lt's Nobel Prize juice. Set sail for home,
for England! A jewel set in the sea!
The government in the palm of my hand.
What's it say?
- You're going on a sea voyage...
- No, this!
-  l don't know.
- Haven't you a degree in Eastern?
-  l don't think so.
- Let's get it translated.
- Now!
- Right!
- l can't swim.
- What do you mean you can't swim?
Treacherous Woman,
tremble...
ln the name of Preverti,
daughter of the mountains,
whose embrace with Rani
made the whole world tremble.
- Wait till my mates get you.
- l don't think so...
We've had two battalions flown in
specially to ambush your friends.
They're quite merciless.
One word of warning from you
and you die instantly.
Oh, mother Kaili,
whose name is the Terrible...
l'm going to miss the sacrifice.
...whose name
is the lnaccessible,
whose name is the Black Mother,
mother of darkness!
We turn our hearts to...
No!
...drinker of blood...
- lt's off! l'm saved!
- ...killer of demons,
drink of this vessel,
gorge on this blood, our offering...
Get sacrificed!
l don't subscribe to your religion!
- There he is!
- lt just came off!
Quickly! After them!
l'm going to miss the sacrifice.
- lt came off! l just showed courage.
- How many fingers you got left?
- You're all red again.
- l'm beginning to like it.
Ah... So! Ha!
He who wears the ring...
Help! l need somebody
Help! Not just anybody
Help! You know l need someone
Help!
When l was younger,
so much younger than today
l never needed anybody's help
in any way
But now these days are gone
l'm not so self assured
Now l find l've changed my mind,
l've opened up the doors
Help me if you can
l'm feeling down
And l do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back
on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
And now my life has changed
in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish
in the haze
But ev'ry now and then
l feel so insecure
l know that l just need you like
l've never done before
Help me if you can
l'm feeling down
And l do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back
on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
