Finn's mom's dating Kurt's dad,
which was totally part of
Kurt's plan
to get closer to Finn,
When will you learn that
nothing is impossible
when it comes to love?
Artie told Tina
what his greatest dream was,
then realized
that not every dream
is achievable.
Is that even a word--
achievable?
Achievatate?
Achievalize?
Okay, you just said, like,
ten offensive things.
Jessie pushed Rachel
to find out who her mom was,
and it turns out
it's Shelby Corcoran,
the coach of Vocal Adrenaline.
I want a look that's so optimistic,
it could cure cancer.
Geez. And that's
Am I in trouble?
Come on. You've got more
self-esteem than that.
I think this might have
something to do with
your perfect attendance
last semester.
No. Miss Cohen-Chang
is in trouble.
It has come to my attention
that the look you sport
is what is known as goth.
American teens
are coming down
with a serious case
of Twilight fever,
transformed from
normal children
into vampires
obsessed with the occult.
And only yesterday,
this dark specter
reared its head
at McKinley High.
This is totally going to get
Robert Pattinson's attention.
{hissing}
Oh, hey.
{girls roaring}
{all screaming}
Oh, dear God!
I don't mean
to state the obvious,
but you do know that vampires
aren't real, right?
They don't exist.
William, denial will not
make this problem go away!
My parents won't even
let me watch Twilight.
My mom says she thinks Kristin
Stewart seems like a bitch.
This is a serious problem!
Miss Cohen-Chang,
you've got to find yourself
another style of dress!
Hold on a second.
Tina is shy,
and one way she's found
to express herself
is through
her clothes.
High school is an
incredibly important time
when kids get to explore
who they are.
When I was in high school,
I had a whole year
where I dressed
exactly like Kurt Cobain.
I mean, come on.
There has to be someone
who you used to dress like.
Yes. For several years
in my early 20s,
I dressed up as Elvis.
But he was a Christian, Will!
And he did not possess the
ability to transform into a bat!
{whispers}:
I think he thinks
vampires are real.
I think you're right.
Studies have shown that
a strict dress code fosters
a safe and stable
learning environment
with fewer instances of
gang violence and vampirism.
So, if I see you dressed in
lacy demon clothes again,
Tina Cohen-Chang,
{pounds desk}
You will be suspended!
Is there a car
down here from me?
Honey, we're indoors.
Oh.
Okay.
And open your eyes.
Sparkling cider?
Yeah.
"Welcome home"?
But who went somewhere?
Burt asked us to move in with them.
And this is how you're telling me?
The party is my idea.
If you're gonna say something,
say it loud, right?
BURT:
Yeah. It's gonna take some
getting used to, but trust me,
you're gonna
love it, okay?
Now you don't have to drag
your tail over here
every time you want to watch
something on the old 55-incher.
We got a lot of food-- some
ethnic food. It's some ethnicity
that's not ours. Tuna cruditÃƒÂ©s.
Tuna cruditÃƒÂ©s. It's not ethnic.
Here you go.
CAROLE:
Finn, this house
is twice as big
as ours.
It has two bathrooms.
Two and a half.
I don't want an extra bathroom
or a tuna crude.
I just want my house back.
I think I know what this
resistance is about.
Our room. And I
couldn't agree more.
The palate in here is totally
unflattering to your skin tone.
Not everyone can
pull off Dior gray.
We need to redecorate.
Wait, we're sharing a room?
I'm not cool with that!
CAROLE:
Baby, I know
it's weird, okay?
But can't be
much of a surprise.
And, in time, you're gonna be
as happy as I am.
Yeah, look, I'll knock
out a wall upstairs,
I'll put an
addition on, okay?
But-but until then,
maybe this will
grease the wheels
a bit, huh?
Oh.
Hey.
Look, that's 300.
Oh, my... Have at it.
You redecorate
this place.
Don't worry, roomie.
Mr. Ikea Catalog and I
will have this all figured out.
I am going to
put together a palate
that expresses
who you are and who
I want you to be.
Who you want to be.
Hey, what night's game night?
You play Sorry?
You know...
He will now.
{chuckles}
I will...
{singsongy}:
Sorry.
I will beat you.
It's so weird.
This so isn't you.
I feel like
an Asian Branch Davidian.
Tina, are there any
other looks you can try?
Biker chick?
Cowgirl?
Hood rat.
Computer programmer.
Cross-country skier.
Catholic schoolgirl.
Happy Meal, no onions.
Or a chicken.
Look, I appreciate it, guys,
but it just isn't me.
I know who I am, and I'm not
allowed to show it.
It's like communism.
Guys, we have
a serious problem.
You know how I've been doing
some deep background
on Vocal Adrenaline?
Isn't that against the rules?
No, not at all.
Or probably. Whatever!
Anyway, what I figured out;
I rooted through the Dumpsters
behind the Carmel auditorium
and I found
of Christmas lights.
Oh, no.
Which led me
to Joelle Fabrics.
I asked them about
red Chantilly lace.
They were sold out.
Oh, sweet Jesus.
Oh, my.
Wait, what?
- They're doing Gaga.
- That's it. It's over.
Exactly.
We should have guessed it.
They're going for
full-out theatricality.
They know it's the easiest way
to beat us. Damn them.
What's up with this Gaga dude?
He just, like, dresses weird,
right? Like Bowie?
{scoffs}
Lady Gaga is a woman.
She's only the
biggest pop act
to come along in decades.
She's boundary-pushing,
the most theatrical performer
of our generation.
And she changes her look
faster than Brit changes
sexual partners.
That's true.
ARTIE:
It makes sense that
Vocal Adrenaline
would pay homage.
It's a brilliant move.
She's a perfect fit
for them.
Hold on a second.
We might be able to kill
two birds with one stone here.
We can help Tina
find a new look
and nd
a competitive number
for regionals.
This week, your assignment:
Gaga.
{gasping, murmuring}
RACHEL:
Pens, we need pens.
My ideas just come to me.
Uh, my office.
Right there.
I'm brainstorming.
It's coming.
And claw, claw,
uh, clap, clap.
And five, six,
seven, eight.
One, two, three, four...
Think they can see us?
{whispering}:
If they catch us,
are we gonna have to go to jail?
Stealing their ideas
is not a crime.
SHELBY:
...six, seven, eight.
And one, two...
Your shoes are making noise.
...and five, six,
seven, eight.
And one, two, three, four, five,
six and seven...
They look amazing.
Claw, claw, uh, clap, clap.
And five, six-- uh, uh...
Okay, okay, okay, just...
enough.
You guys aren't getting it.
Your letting the costumes
do all the work.
Theatricality isn't about crazy outfits.
It's not enough to douse
yourselves with gasoline.
You have to light yourselves
on fire to make it work.
God, she's good.
But being theatrical
doesn't mean you have to be
a nuclear explosion.
It can be like, like a quiet storm.
You just have to radiate emotion,
express what's deep inside you.
That's what theatricality
is truly about.
Do I have to demonstrate?
"Funny Girl," E flat.
# Barbra Streisand's "Funny Girl" #
Exactly what I would have done:
Barbra.
I could do it in my sleep.
- Where are you going?
- Get back here.
¶¶The fella said
"a funny girl"¶¶
Ms. Corcoran?
I'm Rachel Berry,
I'm your daughter.
Did you ever regret it?
Yes.
Then no.
Then so much.
W-When did you realize
it was the right time for me to find you?
{chuckles}
I saw you sing at sectionals.
You were extraordinary.
You were me.
{chuckles}
Was it hard for you
to not become a star?
To not have your dreams come true?
It felt like a broken promise.
Like the Fisher King's wound--
never heals.
Wow.
Genetics really are amazing.
You see the world with the same
fierce theatricality as I do.
Even the way we're sitting
right now is so dramatic,
and yet we feel so
comfortable with it.
I've missed so much.
How do you feel?
Thirsty.
When I was little and
I used to get sad,
my dads would bring me
a glass of water.
It got so I couldn't
tell if I was sad
or just thirsty.
I shouldn't have done this.
This was supposed to feel good.
W-We were supposed
to have some kind of
slow-motion run
into each other's arms.
This is all wrong.
Maybe we can just go to dinner
or something
just to get over
the initial shock.
I'm so sorry, Rachel.
Uh... I'll... I'll call you.
Oh, hey, Finn, come on in.
I'm learning all this amazing
stuff about Lady Gaga.
She's got this thing called
the "Haus of Gaga," which is
like, this collective of artists
and designers
who collaborate on,
on her styles
and stage sets
and her music.
I think it's
an exciting model
for what we could be doing
in Glee Club.
Yeah, that's kind of what
I wanted to talk to you about.
I don't want to do Lady Gaga.
And I suspect that...
with the exception of Kurt...
that none of the other guys
are gonna want to do it either.
I just feel like we're always
doing whatever the girls want us to do.
Yeah. {Will} Yeah, you're right.
Maybe I haven't been listening
to you guys hard enough.
So let's find a solution.
Well, I, uh, I actually
already have one.
You're wrong.
It's a really good name.
It's a rock star name.
You want to name our daughter
"Jack Daniels"?
She's a girl!
Okay, fine, whatever.
Jackie Daniels.
The name is not the point.
I told you this.
I'm giving up the baby
so I don't have
to do this with you.
This is good for you.
Now you can go off
and be a rock star yourself.
I love wearing
champagne bubbles!
I get to express a whole
different side of myself!
Because even though
I'm painfully shy
and obsessed with death, I'm
a really effervescent person.
Excuse me!
Were you dropped on your heads?!
What was that?
I think you heard me.
I'm just saying.
Pick on me-- that's fine--
but don't throw around a girl.
Well, you know, lately,
we haven't been able
to tell the difference.
We're not gaga for Gaga.
You dress all freaky,
and then you rub it
in everybody's faces.
I don't want to look
at it all day!
It's weird.
It makes my eyes tired.
If you want
to switch it up a bit,
just go from Gap
to Banana Republic.
It's called being theatrical.
We're showing off who you are.
It's the same thing you do
when you go to school
with your football
uniforms on.
You're expressing yourself,
and we have every right
to do the same.
Well, you know what?
The next time you want
to express yourself
a little like a circus freak,
don't be shocked when my fist
feels like
expressing itself
against your chin!
Okay?
Knock that crazy fool
crepe-paper nonsense offa you.
Let's go.
Yeah, you don't want
to be late for
your appointment
at Supercuts!
Watch your mouth, homo!
And you know what, fancy?
You don't need
an appointment
at Supercuts.
They love walk-ins.
- {both chortle}
- {school bell rings}
Little monsters, take a bow.
{Will laughs, applause}
All right! Ladies, Kurt, I am
really, really impressed.
Sientete.
You know, you know
what the best part is?
Each one of those costumes
shows off a different aspect
of  your personalities.
Wait. Where's Rachel?
I mean, I only noticed
because, like,
five minutes
have gone by
without her saying something
totally obnoxious.
Rachel kinda got some
intense news yesterday.
We were spying on
Vocal Adrenaline, and...
You guys, that's not fair!
You gotta stop doing that.
But, uh, you know,
what, what'd you find out?
- Okay, y'all ready?
- Miss Corcoran, their coach?
She's Richel's mom.
Are you serious?
Way to bury
the lead, Mercedes.
PUCK:
We're screwed.
Rachel's gonna jump ship
over to Vocal Adrenaline.
Never.
I really don't want
to talk about it, though.
I'm still processing the news.
And my dads are moving
my therapist to our spare room
later this afternoon.
All I can know is that
I'm not going anywhere,
and I've chosen
a Lady Gaga look
that expresses
the longing for a childhood
I was deprived of.
You look terrible.
I look awesome.
I think it's
the Kermit-the-Frog look.
KURT: And we have a jumper.
Well, my dads can't sew,
so these are
just stapled on.
Guys, why don't we worry
about this later,
and maybe try to focus
on the song?
Couldn't agree more.
Hit it!
¶¶Rah-rah, ah-ah-ah!

What up, Finn?
What's that on your face?
You got a bad pimple
or something?
A Finn-ple?
{both laugh}
Dude, are you
wearing makeup?
I knew it was contagious.
You moved in
with that little Kurt kid,
and now you got a bad case
of the gay.
It's just something
for Glee Club, all right?
Oh, well, then it's
definitely not gay, huh?
Get out of my way!
Man, how many times
do we got go through this?!
You being a jock
and being in this Glee Club
does not make you versatile.
It makes you bisexual.
And if we have
to kick your ass
to make you
understand that,
then our schedules
are wide open.
Get out of my bathroom.
You girls, y'all belong
across the hallway.
Glee boy!
{Karofsky laughs}
{sighs}
{dance music playing}
{music stops}
Yeah, that's better, guys.
Take five.
And, ladies, I don't want
to hear about chafing
just because you're being forced
to wear metal underwear.
Not my problem.
Mom?
Hon, you gotta stop sneaking
into these rehearsals.
It's kind of important.
Oh, dear God.
My dads can't sew.
I really need a mom right now.
Do you think you can help?
Sorry I'm late.
Whoa, looking
good, Rachel!
Thanks.
My mom made it.
Very nice.
{Mercedes laughs}
Well, we're all here,
so without further ado,
I'd like to introduce The Boys!
ARTIE:
Lima, Ohio, get ready to rock!
- {girls laugh}
- {KISS' "Shout It Out" begins}
- {cheering}
¶¶Well, the night is young
and you want some fun¶¶
¶¶Do you think
you're gonna find it?¶¶
GIRLS: Whoo!
¶¶You got to treat yourself
like number one¶¶
Whoo!
¶¶It doesn't matter
what you do or say¶¶
¶¶Just forget the things
that you've been told¶¶
¶¶Everybody's got
to rock and roll¶¶
¶¶Don't sit there
broken-hearted¶¶
¶¶Call all your friends
in the neighborhood¶¶
¶¶Don't let 'em tell you
that there's too much noise¶¶
¶¶They're too old
to really understand¶¶
¶¶'Cause it's time for you
to take a stand¶¶
All right, guys,
very impressive.
Very, very... loud.
{chuckles}
But what, uh, what does
that performance express?
And what do those
costumes illustrate?
We did our research, Mr. Shue.
Yeah, Finn's demon look
is because Gene Simmons liked
comic books as a kid,
and they called Paul Stanley
the "Star Child"
because he was a romantic
or something.
But that doesn't
really explain my whore lips.
And my Ace Frehley is supposed
to be a spaceman
from another planet.
Mike's iconic catman
is because Peter Criss
claimed to have nine lives.
Yeah, And I'm dressed as the guy
who replaced Artie when he quit.
Well, congratulations,
guys. Job well done.
Let's give it up
for the boys!
{cheering}
I thought the boys'
KISS number was good,
although the lyrics did leave
something to be desired.
And Finn kept sticking
his tongue out
and I couldn't stop
picturing him licking stuff.
It was disturbing.
We warned you.
Now Gaga's got to go.
Could you have a word
with Azimio and Karofsky
about harassing me without
damaging my Gaga outfit?
Are you serious?
Do you know how difficult
it is with those guys?
They already think
we're boyfriends.
Let them think
what they want.
They're Neanderthals.
In three years, they'll
be cleaning my septic tank.
Don't you get it?
It's not just them.
We live in Ohio--
not New York or San Francisco
or some other city
where people eat vegetables
that aren't fried.
I don't understand
why you always need
to make such a big spectacle
of yourself.
Why can't you just work
harder at blending in?
I'm sure that'd be
easier for you.
You know, it would.
You are such a boy.
You're going to have
to use a moist towelette
if you want to get
that makeup off.
Don't touch me!
What is your problem, Finn?
It's just a moist towelette!
I'm gonna finish
in the laundry room.
Grow up, Finn!
I know why you called,
and don't worry about it.
My reconnection with Rachel
is not some kind of plot
to mess with you guys
before regionals.
I'm not worried about regionals.
It's Rachel.
She's special.
She's got all
of the best of you.
She's strong-willed, dramatic,
wildly talented.
Go on.
But she's not hard like you.
She's fragile.
over-emotional.
And she's clearly
convinced herself
that you are as committed
to this reunion
as she is.
And I don't think you are.
You're not
prepared to have
a teenage daughter.
Are you?
I can't have any more kids.
There were issues
a few years back.
Then some surgery,
and that's that.
I really wanted a daughter.
That's why it was
so important to me
to make that bond with her.
But you're right.
I wanted my baby back.
Rachel's an adult now.
She doesn't need me.
Shelby,
I can't tell you what to do...
But if you really love her,
you have to tell her
what you just told me.
KURT:
I had to skip school
to finish it,
but I think you're really
going to like it.
Consider it a peace offering
after all the yelling
that we've been doing.
I used Marlene Dietrich
and Gary Cooper in Morocco
as my inspiration.
It's a perfect blend
of the masculine
and the feminine,
the muted and the theatrical.
Are you freaking insane?
I can't live here. I'm a dude.
What the hell is that
supposed to be?
It's a privacy partition
It's all I could find
on such short notice.
Why are you getting
angry about everything?
I worked hard on thi
That's not
a privacy partition!
Why is it so
hard for you
to understand?
I don't want to get dressed
in front of you!
Do you know that
I put my underwear on
in the shower
before I come out
when you're around?
I just... I don't want
to have to worry
about that kind of stuff
in my own room, man.
And what stuff
are you referring to?
You know. You know
what I'm talking about.
Don't play dumb.
Why can't you just accept
that I'm not like you?
I have accepted that.
No, you haven't.
You think I don't see
the way you stare at me?
How flirty you get.
You think I don't know
why you got so excited
that we were going to be
moving in together?
It's just a room, Finn!
We can redecorate it
if you want to!
Okay, good.
Well, then the first thing
that needs to go
is that faggy lamp.
And then we need to get rid
of this faggy couch cover...
Hey!
What did you
just call him?
Oh, no, no, I didn't
call him anything.
I was talking to the blanket.
If you use that word,
you're talking about him.
Relax, Dad. I didn't
take it that way.
Yeah, that's because
you're 16
and you still assume
the best in people.
You live a few years,
you start seeing the hate
in people's hearts.
Even the best people.
You use the "N" word?
Of course not.
How about "retard"?
You call that nice girl
in Cheerios! with Kurt,
you call her a retard?
Becky-- no. She's my friend.
She's got Down syndrome.
I'd never call her that.
That's cruel.
But you think it's okay
to come into my house
and say "faggy"?
That's not what I meant...
I know what you meant!
What, you think I didn't use
that word when I was your age?
You know,
some kid
gets clocked in practice,
we'd tell him to stop
being such a fag.
Shake it off.
We meant it exactly
the way you meant it.
That being gay is wrong.
That it's some kind
of punishable offense.
I really thought
you were different, Finn.
You know, I thought
that being in Glee Club
and being raised
by your mom
meant that you were some,
you know,
new generation of dude
who saw things differently.
Who just kind of, you know,
came into the world
knowing what has taken me
years of struggling
to figure out.
I guess I was wrong.
I'm sorry, Finn, but you
can't... you can't stay here.
Dad.
I love your mom.
And maybe this is
going to cost me her,
but my family comes first.
I can't have that kind
of poison around.
This is our home, Kurt.
He is my son.
Out in the world,
you do what you want,
but not under my roof.
The place looks great.
- You should be in orbit.
- My balls keep fallinoff.
Been there.
I want to talk about this.
There's not much to say.
I feel sorry for you.
I thought you were different.
I am different.
WILL:
All right, let's
get things started.
Mr. Shue.
There's something
I want to say to Quinn.
And I want everybody
to hear it.
All right.
At first I didn't really get
this theatrical assignment,
being larger than life and
putting it all out there,
'cause I'm kind
of like that all the time.
That's how my dad was, too.
He was too busy being all crazy
and rock and roll
to be there for his kid.
And you know what?
I didn't care that
my dad was a badass.
I just wanted him to be there.
And he never was.
And then I learned
all this KISS stuff
and while Jackie Daniels
is a great name for like
a powerboat or something,
it's not right for a baby girl.
So if my KISS mates
will help me out,
I got a better idea.
Grab a stool, guys.
{KISS' "Beth" intro playing}
¶¶Beth, I hear you calling¶¶
¶¶But I can't come home
right now¶¶
¶¶Me and the boys are playing¶¶
¶¶And we just can't
find the sound¶¶
¶¶Just a few more hours¶¶
¶¶And I'll be right home
to you¶¶
¶¶I think I hear them calling¶¶
¶¶Oh, Beth, what can I do?¶¶
¶¶Beth, what can I do?¶¶
¶¶You say you feel so empty¶¶
¶¶That our house
just ain't our home¶¶
¶¶I'm always somewhere else¶¶
¶¶And you're always
there alone¶¶
¶¶Just a few more hours¶¶
¶¶And I'll be

¶¶I think I hear them calling¶¶
¶¶Oh, Beth, what can I do?¶¶
¶¶Beth, what can I do?¶¶
¶¶Beth, I know you're lonely¶¶
¶¶And I hope
you'll be all right¶¶
¶¶'Cause me and the boys
will be playing all night¶¶
¶¶All night.¶¶
I know you're
giving her up,
but before you do, I think
you should name her Beth.
If you'll let me,
I'd really like to be there
when she's born.
I'd really like to meet her.
So, how'd your dads come up
with the name "Rachel"?
They were, um,
big Friends fans.
I know why you're here...
to say good-bye.
I really wanted this to work.
Do you know what
really turned me?
That story that you told me
about your dads,
and how they'd bring you water
when you were sad.
We're never gonna have
anything like that.
It's too late
for us.
I just think that anything
we share right now
is gonna be confusing for you.
I just don't understand.
You're my mom.
I feel awful right now,
and I should want
to just fall into your arms
and let you rock me
and tell me everything
is gonna be fine, but...
I just don't feel it.
It's because I'm your mother,
but I'm not your mom.
So what? Do we just pretend
we don't know each other now?
That seems silly.
Let's just be grateful
for one another...
from afar.
For a while.
Don't think for
a second I'm gonna
go soft on you
during regionals.
{sniffles}
Bring it. {chuckles}
Can I have a hug good-bye?
Sure.
{sniffles}
Can you do me one more favor?
Sometime when you're thirsty...
can you get yourself some water
from this cup?
Gold stars are
kinda my thing.
Of course. {chuckles}
Shelby...
before you go, will...
will you sing with me?
Just one time.
It's sort of a fantasy of mine,
and it would really mean
a lot to me.
I would be honored.
Brad!
He's always just around.
Um, take that.
Here you go.
{chuckles}

You are really, really good.
{sniffling}
{school bell ringing}
Whoa!
Guys, why are you all
in your theatricality costumes?
It's the end of the week.
We were kinda hoping
to learn what the lesson
of the assignment was.
Well, um...
you guys have had some
great numbers this week,
but I'm not totally sure
that I know either.
{all laugh}
I do.
I refuse to dress
like somebody I'm not
to be somebody I'm not.
And I learned it's good
to be a little theatrical.
{gasps}
So here's what's
going to happen.
My dad-- he's the king
of the vampires.
And Asian vampires are the most
vicious of all the vampires.
You're going to let me
wear my lady demon clothes,
or my dad will fly into your
bedroom and bite your face off.
He's really pissed.
Is that what you want?
No, I don't want that.
I'm afraid.
Good. I'm glad we had this talk.
Now I have to go back
to my coffin
because the light is burning
my eyes!
{applause}
There she is.
{all cheering}
Wait. Where's Kurt?
Where's Finn?
Fine.
You want to hit me?
You want to beat me up?
Go ahead.
But I swear to you
I will never change.
I'm proud to be different.
It's the best thing about me.
So go ahead, hit me.
I believe I will.
Sir, would you
like to go first?
FINN:
You're not hitting anyone.
Oh, my God.
Is he wearing a red rubber
dress or am I trippin'?
I want to thank you, Kurt.
I realize I still have
a lot to learn,
but the reason I'm here
right now...
in a shower curtain,
is... because of you.
And I'm not going to let anyone
lay a hand on you.
{chuckles}
Oh, really, dude?
'Cause I'm pretty sure
we can take both of you.
PUCK:
Yeah?
But can you take
all of us?
AZIMIO:
Okay.
Okay, I get it.
I took biology.
You know what, Karofsky?
We done disturbed
the freak hive.
The worker freaks is trying
to protect the queen freak.
Next time...
we'll bring some friends, too.
I'm tired of everyone
calling us freaks.
Welllook at us.
We are freaks.
{all laugh}
But we're all freaks
together.
And we shouldn't
have to hide it.
{Will clapping}
Nice job, Finn.
I think you just figured out
what the lesson was.
Kinda makes me wish
I had planned it.
But Mercedes is right,
You do all look incredibly insane.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're so welcome.
WILL:
Anyways, let's get
back to work
before you're all forced
to join the circus.
Next stop? Regionals.
