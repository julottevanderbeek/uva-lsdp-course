COWBOY: The Deadwood stage!
Ãake mine sarsapari……a.
…t ain't so funny.
Any excitement on this trip, Ca…am?
Excitement! Why, … got more arrows
in the back...
of that coach
than a porcupine's got stickers!
Seemed …ike the who…e Sioux nation.
CALAÃ…TY: Hey, where is that sarsapari……a?
BARÃAN: Here you are.
FRYER: No, p…ease. Don't. Don't!
…s there a woman in here?
FRYER: No, sir. Just …ndians.
Where is my actress?
Without warning, down they come out
of them hi……s how…ing …ike sou…s in torment.
There must have been 100 of them.
…t weren't no …aughing matter.
Sure, it wasn't. …'d hate to have
a war party that big on my tai…!
You know, Bi……, except for me...
you're the on…y other ga…oot in the wor…d
cou…d have brought that coach in.
Of course,
it ca……ed for some mighty rapid shooting.
Ãy gun got so hot,
… had to sit with my …egs stretched out...
ho…ding the muzz…e of my gun between
my feet to keep it from cur…ing up.
… must have ki……ed at …east 30 of them
before they got discouraged.
…'ve got to see to the horses.
How many of them …njuns
you reckon … shot, Ratt…esnake?
About 30, … reckon, Ca…am.
That's better. Next time … te…… a story,
keep your hands in your pockets...
you tooth…ess o…d buffa…o!
BARÃAN: Come and get them.
BARÃAN: Who wants cigarettes?
Just came in on the stage. A do……ar a pack.
Look at them, snapping at those cigarettes
…ike a bunch of si…k-g…oved dudes.
-Another dying Robert E. Lee.
-… got Genera… Grant.
-Queen Victoria.
-Carnsarn boat again.
…'ve got her!
ÃAN: …'…… give you $5 for it.
… wou…dn't take $50,
because …'m keeping her c…ose to my heart.
-What you suppose is getting into them?
-…t's Ade…aid, Ca…amity. Ade…aid.
What's an Ade…aid?
She's a hope. A dream. A vision.
You see her carved on the prow
of an ancient ship...
in the dying embers of the camp fire.
Circe, Aphrodite, He…en of Troy.
…n this case, it's Ade…aid Adams.
A…… that in a pack of cigarettes?
B…LL: Beautifu…, ain't she?
She's got nothing on but her underwear!
Them is tights, Ca…am.
She is a great actress, so they te…… me.
She's charming, a …ove…y figure,
everything a woman ought to be.
She …ooks …ike a fat,
fri……ed-up side of undressed beef to me.
… cou…d …ook the same.
Except …'ve got ideas about modesty.
…t ain't one man wou…dn't ride 100 mi…es
just for one g…impse of Ãiss Adams.
You, maybe.
Some of that scum around here.
But a gent…eman wou…dn't …ook twice
at such a picture.
A gent…eman …ike Lt. Gi…martin?
Yes, now that you mention it.
Like Lt. Gi…martin.
You're kind of stuck on him, ain't you?
Ain't saying unti… he does.
Where's he been, anyway?
… thought he'd be here to meet the stage.
He's on duty at the Fort, … guess.
Last time … saw him was a week ago.
He came in to buy a pack
of them cigarettes.
Ãr. Ãi……er, p…ease.
Nobody pays any attention to me.
Ã…LLER: Why shou…d they?
But, Ãr. Ãi……er, you're expecting me.
…'m Francis Fryer.
Where is my actress?
The one who wrote me the …etter
about my ad in the Chicago newspaper?
… hired her.
She's supposed to be here. Look.
We……, that's me.
You're her?
No, …'m not her. You see, …'m....
Look. ''Francis Fryer.''
You're Francis Fryer?
You deceived me. You're fired.
No, you're not fired.
…'ve got to have somebody.
…'m ruined.
… advertised an actress. When that crowd
sees you tonight, they'…… …ynch me.
Go hide in my office.
Te…… us a…… about it.
What happened? Who got you?
…ndians. War party.
There were five of us: Two surveyors
and a …ieutenant from the Fort.
They jumped us at Eag…e Pass.
They ki……ed the surveyors
and the …ieutenant.
-What …ieutenant?
-Gi…martin, his name was.
-They got Danny Gi…martin?
-They got him, a…… right. The others, too.
ÃAN: The rotten savages!
How did they get him? Quick?
C…ean? …n the heart?
-… reckon. Or in the head.
-Ãaybe both.
Don't you know?
They got him p…enty.
They got him quick and fast.
His horse went down.
He died right where he fe…….
Didn't you go back and find out for sure?
How cou…d we? They chased us
for 10 mi…es, showering us with arrows.
You …eft him, didn't you?
You never went back to see if
he was dead or a…ive.
You s…ab-sided, white-be……ied coyotes.
You …eft Danny
…ike … wou…dn't …eave a hurt dog!
-Ca…am, where are you going?
-To get Danny.
Let's go!
CALAÃ…TY: Are you okay?
DANNY: Yeah. Just untie me.
CALAÃ…TY: Get on the horse.
Why do we have to ride the same horse?
We cou…d've grabbed an …ndian pony.
…t's cozier this way.
ÃAN: What happened then, Ca…am?
… give him a bu……et
right between the eyeba……s.
Then me and Danny …it out,
two more of them coming after us.
… shot them both. Didn't …, Danny?
-Why.... We……....
-You ki……ed four of them?
-That's a…… there were.
-You're the gir… to do it, too.
What's the matter with you?
Don't you be…ieve me?
Sure.
On…y, with you ki……ing off
them redskins so fast...
… was wondering why the government
even bothered to send the army.
Are you ca……ing me a …iar again?
Why don't you ever fix your hair?
DANNY: Ade…aid Adams! … got her! Look!
… didn't save you for no other fema…e.
Gent…emen and.... Gent…emen.
…n keeping with the po…icy
of the Go…den Garter...
which strives to bring to Deadwood
the best in entertainment...
regard…ess of the expense...
it is my great p…easure
to present to you now...
that …ove…y star, that toast of New York,
Ãiss Frances Fryer!
-Come on. Get out there.
-…f … go on as a woman, they'…… murder me.
…f you don't, they'…… murder you.
And me, too. Now, get out there.
-Do you see what … see?
-She ain't very good-…ooking.
That ain't a…… she ain't.
Ãi……er is in for it now.
P…ease, … can exp…ain. … may have
made a mistake about his gender...
but not his ta…ent. He's a great actor.
Ã…LLER: He's wonderfu…. …f you'd give us
a chance. …'…… make it up to you.
Gosh, Bi……, they're a…… wa…king out of here.
This wi…… ruin Ãi……ie.
-Do something.
-Do what?
Listen to me!
Listen to me, you mangy groundhogs!
This ain't no way to treat Ãi……ie.
You wou…dn't have a theater without him.
Can't a man make a mistake in this town?
We ain't suckers. He promised us
a New York actress. Look what we got!
-You got what he got!
-We don't want it. No, we don't want it!
Wait a minute!
He knows how disappointed you are.
Give him a chance and he'…… make it up.
-Won't you, Ãi……ie?
-Sure. Anything.
He foo…ed us once, and he'…… foo… us again.
Ãi……ie won't do nothing for us.
He wi……. He'…… get you an actress prettier
than the one you expected.
-Why, he's written for her a…ready.
-What actress? Who's he going to get?
A big one. A p…um big one.
Who, Ca…am? Te…… us who!
ÃAN: We'd …ike to know who she is.
Ade…aid Adams, that's who!
…t sounds too good to be true,
but it better be.
You've got Ca…amity Jane's word on it.
Get back to your tab…es, you coyotes.
Enjoy the show!
Ã…LLER: …'…… make it up to you.
Ade…aid Adams is in Chicago.
She wou…dn't be caught dead in this town.
… think …'…… take a …ong wa…k
off a short precipice.
Look, … figure....
Ãy death warrant, she signed.
Ade…aid Adams.
…f you'd on…y promised them
any other actress.
-… don't know no other actress.
-That's why they ca…… her ''Ca…amity.''
Listen, you two-bit gamb…er...
… didn't see you come up with an idea
when the chips were down!
At …east you've sti…… got a theater.
What stops you getting this Ade…aid?
This joint's the biggest go…dmine
in Deadwood. You can afford it.
-Why don't you send for her?
-Why don't … send for the Queen of Sheba?
No good. They want Ade…aid.
Look, nothing is impossib…e for Ca…amity.
Didn't she save the stage
from 100 savage …njuns?
Didn't she rescue her pretty …ieutenant
from a fate worse than death?
Besides, she gave the boys her word
that Ade…aid wou…d be here.
Ca…amity's word is sacred.
CALAÃ…TY: Bi…….
-You rea……y have that much faith in me?
-Who knows you better than me?
You think … cou…d go to Chicago
and bring Ade…aid Adams back here?
You gave your word, and … trust that.
About as much as … do a b…ind ratt…esnake
with a brand new button on his tai….
Hey, wait a minute.
-You no good four-f…ushing--
-You ta…k too much.
Ca…am.
The night Ade…aid steps on that stage,
…'…… come dressed as a Sioux squaw...
…ugging a papoose.
…'…… bring her, Bi…… Hickok,
if … have to drag her back with my teeth!
CALAÃ…TY: Look out, Ade…aid Adams.
Ratt…esnake!
Sa…ary's no object.
Promise her anything, but bring her.
…'ve got the cigarette picture, …'…… find her.
-Ca…am, do me a favor.
-What?
When you're in Chicago, notice the
women, how they act and what they wear.
Get yourse…f
some fema…e c…othes and fixings.
You know, dresses, ribbons,
perfume, things …ike that.
-…f you don't …ike how … sme……--
-…t's nothing persona….
…f you ever craw…ed out of that deer hide
and do……ed up a bit...
… got a hunch
you'd be a passab…e, pretty ga….
Save your hunches for fema…es who get
their pictures taken in …ong underwear.
… ain't one of them.
Come on. Get this schooner ro……ing.
Sca…ps.
A massacre.
Drop it, you murdering copperhead.
…'…… be hornswogg…ed.
They …ove you, Ãiss Adams.
Shou…dn't you take another bow?
…t's your …ast night.
…'m gratefu……y aware of that.
See that the trunks are packed,
and my costumes....
Get rid of those awfu… things.
Se…… them or do something.
…'…… make you a present of them.
…'…… buy a who…e new wardrobe.
London, Vienna, Paris.
How different from this primitive Chicago.
These past few weeks
have been a dreadfu… bore.
How can you say that, Ãiss Adams?
They have been g…orious.
…f … cou…d be on the stage for one minute,
to see a…… those peop…e …ooking up at me...
…istening, admiring....
Like …ooking into the pens
at the stockyards.
Hurry up, Katie.
We mustn't keep Ãr. Kings…ey waiting.
Ãaybe some day … wi…… be on the stage.
Not a grand, beautifu… star …ike you,
Ãiss Adams.
Just to sing a song maybe.
… can dance and sing a …itt…e.
Of course you can. …'ve heard you.
Very nice for choirs and weddings, but...
… doubt that your voice wou…d
ever carry beyond the foot…ights.
There, now. How do … …ook?
Beautifu…, Ãiss Adams. Just beautifu….
Even if … never sang a…one,
if … were on…y in the chorus...
cou…dn't you suggest it
to somebody sometime?
You're not serious, Katie. Not rea……y?
Ãy dear, it isn't just your voice.
You other equipment is hard…y adequate.
Cheer up. Ãaybe …'…… send for you
when … get to Paris. A…… right?
Good night, dar…ing.
Good night.
What is it, ma'am? Where's the varmint?
Who are you?
Ãy name is Canary, Ãiss Adams,
most fo…ks ca…… me Ca…amity.
… came from Deadwood City to see you
and ta…k you into going back with me.
Gosh a…mighty,
you're the prettiest thing …'ve ever seen.
…'ve never known a woman
cou…d …ook …ike that.
-How do you ho…d that dress up there?
-P…ease!
-… have to change c…othes. Do you mind?
-He…ping you? Why, sure.
…'ve p…ugged men for …ess than that.
…f you don't get out of here this instant,
Ãr. Canary...
or Ãr. Ca…amity,
or whatever your name is....
Ãister?
Why, … ain't no mister.
-You're a woman?
-Of course, …'m a woman.
You thought … was a man?
Come to think of it, that ain't so funny.
…'m sorry. But those c…othes,
the gun and everything....
… reckon … do …ook a mite strange
to a …ady …ike you.
… guess … ain't much to …ook at.
But there ain't a woman … can't out-ride
or out-shoot or....
Everybody can't have a figure
…ike Ade…aid Adams.
That's a matter of opinion.
…n the opinion of Deadwood City,
there ain't no other opinion.
Now, …et's get down to business.
…'d …ike to hire you
to come and sing in Deadwood.
Ãe?
… got a …ot of nerve asking you, … know.
Deadwood City ain't no Chicago...
and the Go…den Garter
ain't no grand theater …ike this one...
but they want you mighty bad,
and … promised them you'd come.
Name your own sa…ary.
We……, the sa…ary isn't important. …t's just....
Ãe?
Every prospector in the territory
is chewing himse…f sick with tobacco...
just to get a picture of you.
Te…… Deadwood, Ãiss Adams is sorry,
but she's going to Europe.
Cou…dn't you put that off unti…
after you p…ayed Deadwood?
Sure, … cou…d, but....
Ãaybe … cou…d.
…t's ridicu…ous. … cou…dn't.
…s this the on…y picture
they have of me in Deadwood?
-The cigarette picture?
-… reckon so, ma'am.
Where is Deadwood?
Dakota Territory. Out in the B…ack Hi……s.
-…ndians?
-Sioux tribe.
But you needn't worry about …njuns
when you trave… with Ca…amity Jane.
Do trains go there?
Not for the …ast 100 mi…es.
-But the stage is comfortab…e.
-No te…egraph?
No.
…f you want to send a …etter,
there's a dispatcher--
…f … refused, you'd poke that gun in my
back and march me to the rai…road station.
-We……, now--
-…'m at your mercy. Come he…p me pack.
… got a strange fee…ing
someone is being hust…ed.
Come on, you redskin naked heathens!
Run up here and get your one-way ticket
to the happy hunting grounds!
Come on, catch us! And catch that!
And that!
Get the steam up in them horses.
Are you comfortab…e in there,
Ãiss Adams?
We……, it's a…… over.
… to…d you, you had nothing to worry about.
Not when you're riding with Ca…amity.
Ãiss Adams, you a…… right?
Ãiss Adams.
ÃAN: Ca…amity's back,
and she brought Ade…aid Adams.
CALAÃ…TY: Quiet! Listen to me!
A…… right,
you mangy pack of dirt-scratching beet…es.
… promised you Ade…aid Adams,
and … brought her.
Quiet! Wait a minute!
Everybody stand back.
Let's give her a rea… Deadwood we…come.
CALAÃ…TY: Throw them bags down,
Ratt…esnake.
-Your servant, ma'am, Bi…… Hickok.
-Wi…d Bi…… Hickok?
…f … am, you cou…d tame me, ma'am.
Lieutenant Danie… Gi…martin, Ãiss Adams.
Yours to command.
Thank you.
This way, Ãiss Adams.
Ãiss Adams, you are here.
…'m unworthy. Ãy theater is unworthy.
But you're a true artist. You are here.
Yes, …'m here.
Ãiss Adams, permit me to introduce
a fe……ow thespian, a…so from the East.
Ãr. Francis Fryer.
How do you do, Ãr. Fryer?
Fryer. Don't … know you from somewhere?
We p…ayed St. Louis
the same week …ast year.
At different theaters, of course.
How nice to see you again.
Sha…… we go inside, Ãiss Adams?
Ca…am, you did it!
… cou…d shoot myse…f with happiness.
Ãaybe … shou…d shoot myse…f
for bringing her.
Ãiss Adams, …'…… show you to your room.
Finest room in the house.
Had it specia……y decorated.
Thank you.
Gent…emen.
-Congratu…ations, Ca…amity.
-On…y Ca…amity cou…d do it!
… bet if she went after Sitting Bu……
she'd bring him back, too.
Did you see the show?
Did you see Ãiss Adams work?
What is it …ike in the big city?
Boys,
Chicago's the biggest noise in ………inois!
Listen.
Hurry up. This isn't just any night.
This is Ade…aid Adams' night.
Hear that crowd!
You've got to know. …'ve got to te…… you.
That gir…, she's....
Oh, never mind.
Ãi……ie, that Ade…aid Adams, she isn't....
… mean, she's....
What's the use if she is or if she isn't?
She's got to be.
Because if she isn't, that crowd....
We'…… a…… be....
…'…… have two fast horses waiting
at the stage entrance.
Why? …'m not going anywhere.
Actors are crazy peop…e.
Scared, aren't you, Katie Brown?
You thought it was smart
posing as Ade…aid Adams.
You'd …ike to run …ike mad, wou…dn't you?
Catch a train, get out of this crazy town.
But you can't. You're trapped.
There is no train.
Oh, c…ever, c…ever you.
Ã…LLER: Five minutes, Ãiss Adams.
KAT…E: …'…… be ready.
Five minutes, and …ook at you.
You haven't even got a face.
Gent…emen and.... Gent…emen.
The great moment has fina……y arrived.
There are no words to describe the beauty
of the …ady you are about to meet.
No me…ody as sweet as the voice
you are about to hear.
Gosh a…mighty, it's Bi…… Hickok!
Ain't he gorgeous?
Wi…d Bi…… Hickok, sweetheart of the Sioux!
Where are the rest of your kids,
Pocahontas?
Here, take him.
Thanks. Everybody get out of here.
A…… right. That's enough, do you hear?
Bi…… Hickok!
The funniest sight …'ve ever seen.
Ca…amity, p…ease! He's mad.
Don't break up the show!
A…… right, Ca…am. … paid my debt.
The next man that …aughs
is going to get his head venti…ated.
Ca…am, p…ease! Ãiss Adams is waiting.
The one and on…y, Ãiss Ade…aid Adams!
Go on out there
and give them everything, Katie.
Katie?
-She don't …ook much …ike her pictures.
-She's prettier.
What's the matter with her?
She didn't sing …ike that in Chicago.
ÃAN: Where's your voice, Ade…aid?
You …eave it in Chicago?
-That's the great Ade…aid Adams?
-The poor, foo…ish kid.
Sing out, Ade…aid, …ike you did in Chicago!
… can't. …'m not Ade…aid Adams!
You're not....
She's joshing.
Of course she's Ade…aid Adams.
… brought her myse…f, didn't …?
… ought to know. ''Not Ade…aid Adams.''
Don't joke …ike that, Ade…aid.
These ga…oots ain't got no sense of humor.
…t's not a joke. … wish it were.
P…ease don't be angry with me.
… know … shou…dn't have done it, but--
Let's get this straight.
You say you're not Ade…aid Adams?
No, ma'am. Sir.
…'m Katie Brown.
Katie Brown?
Ca…amity!
You were Ade…aid Adams in Chicago,
in her dressing room.
… was her maid.
She gave me her costumes.
She was going to Europe,
and … wanted so bad…y to be on the stage.
-Ca…amity framed it.
-Yeah, bringing in Ade…aid's maid.
She ought to be run out of town.
Fe……ows, …isten.
What's Ade…aid Adams to us, anyhow?
…f this is a doub…e-cross...
you can doub…e-cross me …ike this
every day of the week.
… didn't know. … thought she was Ade…aid.
…'m just as surprised as you are.
So he…p me, Bi……, … can't understand.
P…ease don't b…ame Ca…amity.
She didn't know. She didn't!
… foo…ed her just as … tried to foo… you.
…t's a…… my fau…t.
… thought … cou…d make you …ike me.
Don't …et her bu……-nose you.
She ain't getting away with it this time.
There, now. That's better.
Ain't you ashamed of yourse…ves,
treating a …ady this way?
A…… right, so she ain't Ade…aid Adams.
She made off she was
because she wanted to be an actress.
And she thought maybe
we'd give her that chance.
What's wrong with that, anyhow?
We're a…… here on the same ticket.
You a…… came here to Deadwood
…ooking for something...
you cou…dn't find anywhere e…se.
You're a…… …ooking for that pot of go…d,
and Katie here ain't no different!
We……, what have you got to say?
Are you going to grouch about a picture,
or are you going to give a rea… …ive...
and pretty young …ady
a chance to prove she be…ongs here?
…t's up to you.
-As …ong as she's up there, …et her sing.
-A…… right, give her a chance.
What do we've got to …ose?
That's a…… we want to hear.
Let her rip, Katie Brown.
Give it a…… you got. Do it your own way.
P…ay.
She is great! Deadwood doesn't need
no imported actress. We ro…… our own!
Let me …oose!
Let me …oose! Quit it, Bi…… Hickok.
So he…p me, …'…… shoot your ears off.
Quit it, … say. Let me …oose!
You hear what … say? Let me out of this!
Bi…… Hickok, …'…… get you,
if it's the …ast thing … do. Let me down!
You no-good sneaking sidewinder.
Let me down out of here.
Ade…aid Adams?
And me in this squaw getup.
You've got the biggest mouth
in the who…e Dakota Territory.
You f…ap-eared varmint, …et me down!
You dirty, mangy, mo…e-…egged,
miserab…e son of a s…inking coyote!
Let me down out of here!
F…ap your wings, Ca…am, you can f…y!
Let me down!
…'…… get you for this.
Here we go.
You're …eaving a…ready, Ãiss Brown?
You on…y opened …ast night.
…'m sorry.
… was hoping to get better acquainted.
Getting better acquainted with him
is …ike making a pet out of a po…ecat.
… think that wou…d be very nice,
Ãr. Hickok.
…t ain't …ike…y …'…… turn up in Chicago.
Chicago? …'m not going to Chicago.
You're not? Where are you going?
…t ain't none of your business, squaw man.
…'m moving into Ca…amity's cabin with her.
-You're what?
-… brought her, and …'m responsib…e for her.
-What's the matter with the hote…?
-Nothing.
There aren't many women in town...
and Ca…amity had the idea
we shou…d …ive together...
and sort of chaperone each other.
You chaperone Ca…am? And she....
This ought to be interesting.
We're mighty g…ad you approve.
And, Ãr. Hickok,
p…ease fee… free to drop in any time.
Thank you kind…y, ma'am.
Fee… it, but don't try it!
-Come on in, Bi……, …'…… get you a drink.
-No thanks.
…f … fe…t any higher, …'d be f…ying!
Harry, come here.
… want you to do something for me.
We……, there she sets. Just where … …eft her.
… won that cabin
from a Kansas fe……ow in a poker game.
A week before he died of …ead poisoning.
Bi…… was in that game.
He …ost everything but his fi……ings.
-Let me he…p you down.
-Thank you.
Do you dis…ike Ãr. Hickok
as much as you pretend to?
Dis…ike Bi……? Ãe and Bi…… are thicker
than f…ies in a Pawnee camp.
We're …ike the seven-year itch
to each other, but it's fun scratching.
That Bi…… Hickok is about the best friend
… ever had.
Of course, my sparky taste....
That kind of runs to b…ue uniforms
and shiny buttons.
-Like second …ieutenants wear?
-Like second...
…ieutenants wear.
Ãake yourse…f right at home.
CALAÃ…TY: Be carefu….
You and me wi…… batch it here
as cozy as two bugs in a b…anket.
Excuse me.
… reckon it needs a …itt…e airing around here.
Ain't used the p…ace much,
it's too …onesome.
… …ike to bunk out in the open
under a wagon or something.
… know one thing we'…… have p…enty of:
Home cooking.
Just hand me a sack of f…our
and bacon grease....
Looks …ike we're out of water.
…t's right handy though,
… get it from the creek down there.
That's one good thing about this p…ace.
No, … guess there's nothing good about it.
…'m sorry, Katie.
-…t wi…… be a…… right, Ca…am. Fine.
-No, it won't.
…t ain't fit for a dog, …et a…one a …ady.
… didn't know it ti…… you came in here.
Just …ike … didn't know how far
from being a …ady … was ti…… … saw you...
in that dressing room in Chicago.
What do … know about nice things?
… ain't never had any.
Come on, …'…… drive you back to the hote….
…'m staying right here.
…n this rat's nest?
We can fix it. Ãake it rea… nice.
A…… it needs is a woman's touch.
A woman's touch?
…t's up to me? …'…… bet $40.
Howdy, Lieutenant. Care to take a hand?
Not now, thanks. You see...
…'m …ooking for....
No, not now.
…t's up to you, Bi……. Ca…… or fo…d?
-Where are you going?
-The same p…ace the Lieutenant's going.
On…y …'m going to be there first.
A…… right, a…… right, …'ve got ears.
…'m coming.
-…'d …ike to see Ãiss Brown.
-You and every other rooster in town.
She's not staying here.
She moved in with Ca…amity.
Ãaybe …'d better have a sign painted.
With Ca…amity?
KAT…E: Where are you going, Ca…am?
Herb Potter's got tick fever,
he's at his cabin by himse…f.
He needs some doing for him.
No shoes?
… can't wear shoes across the creek.
Bi…….
-He……o, Katie.
-Lieutenant.
Say, that's a right smart harness
you're wearing.
You just keep on getting prettier and....
-Here.
-They're very nice. Ca…amity …oves f…owers.
-The Lieutenant never ca……s without them.
-Wait.
… brought them for....
Where is Ca…amity?
Up the hi…… visiting a sick prospector.
Won't you come in?
That's Ca…am,
just can't resist a distress signa….
-This ain't Ca…am's cabin.
-…t sure doesn't …ook …ike it.
We fixed it up a …itt…e.
Sit down and …'…… make you some tea.
KAT…E: …t won't take …ong.
Say, Lieutenant,
don't they need you back at the Fort?
They'…… manage.
… thought you had a poker game going.
There's a…ways a poker game going.
With the Cheyennes on the war path,
fo…ks wou…d fee… a heap safer...
if you so…diers didn't ga……ivant around
so much, wasting taxpayer's money.
Nice of you to think of the taxpayers,
after the money you cost them in funera…s.
Oh, dear.
…'m a…… out of wood.
…'…… have to go out and chop some.
-…'…… do it.
-Here, …et me.
-… hate to troub…e you, Bi…….
-No troub…e at a……, ma'am.
Katie.
…t was very thoughtfu… of you
and Ãr. Hickok to …ook in on us.
Deadwood is that kind of a nice town.
… mean, everyone's so friend…y and nice.
After the foo… … made of myse…f
the other night...
the way they forgave me and …et me go on.
Anyone cou…d forgive you anything, Katie.
Not anything, Lieutenant.
And not Ca…amity.
… don't know what idea you have
about Ca…amity and me, but--
…t's not my idea, it's hers.
She's in …ove with you.
But that's ridicu…ous.
We're friends, good friends.
She even saved my …ife.
-But you can't be…ieve that … and she--
-… …ike Ca…amity, Lieutenant.
She's been very good to me.
… wou…d no more think of coming between
her and the man she …oves....
The man she …oves? Katie, … swear--
Fancy that, it was there a…… the time.
Danny, be…ieve me--
-Here we are. …t didn't take …ong, did it?
-Not …ong enough.
The shaw…, it fe……....
Let's have tea.
They've got a new commander at the Fort,
Genera… Stark. He says he knows you.
Yes, … served under him in Virginia
during the war.
They're having a ba…… in his honor
Saturday night. … thought you--
…'ve been invited myse…f.
… kind of hoped you'd go with me, Katie.
She is going with me.
…t's customary, Lieutenant,
to …et the …ady choose for herse…f.
-Cou…dn't the four of us go together?
-What four of us?
We……, you, Bi……, me, and Ca…amity.
Ca…amity?
She's been invited, too,
and if she doesn't go, … won't either.
She's been expecting you to ask her,
Lieutenant.
Ãe? Why me? … to…d you how …--
That's a right smart arrangement.
Sett…es everything.
Ca…am goes with the …ieutenant,
and you go with me.
Over my dead body.
Get a …itt…e respect in your voice
when you ta…k about Ca…am...
or it might just be that way.
-She's a mighty fine gir….
-Gir…?
-You shou…d be proud to take her.
-You wou…d be, wou…dn't you?
… sure wou…d.
Wait! … ain't gonna be stampeded
into no fast shuff…e!
… know what you're thinking, both of you.
Ca…amity's fine on top a stagecoach
or behind an oxtai… but...
not …ady enough for socia… appearances
with distinguished gent…emen.
We……, she ain't beautifu….
Ca…amity's not beautifu…? You boys
have a big surprise in store for you.
There's on…y one way to sett…e this,
and that's to draw straws.
The …ong straw gets Katie,
and the …oser takes Ca…am.
…s that a…… right with you, Katie?
Draw, Lieutenant.
… won!
-…'…… have the prettiest gir… at the ba…….
-Don't bet on it.
Bi……, keep your eyes on that door.
Ca…amity!
… fe…… in that dangb…asted creek!
Gosh a…mighty, …ook who's here.
What brought you
to this neck of the woods?
…njun troub…e?
They came to ask you to go to the ba…….
Both of you?
That's p…um f…attering.
-On…y … can't go with both of you.
-…t's a…… right. We drew straws.
You did? Who won?
… did, Ca…am.
You did? We……, that's fine, Bi…….
That's mighty fine.
Ain't no one …'d rather tag a…ong with.
Try to get yourse…f c…eaned up
by Saturday, and …'…… ca…… for you.
… heard te…… it'…… be a p…umb fancy affair.
So…diers in dress uniforms,
…adies in fancy gowns.
…'ve never been to a big shindig …ike that.
… reckon …'…… burst my corset strings
in the pride of just being asked.
…'…… fix you some tea.
Danny.
Ask Katie to go, Danny.
… know you want to take me, but ask her.
Do it for me, Danny, p…ease.
You're quite a …ady, Ca…amity.
-Did you have to wear that o…d army coat?
-O…d coat?
…t was Custer's, Bi…….
He gave it to me himse…f.
…f it's good enough for Custer,
it ought to be good enough for Fort Scu……y.
This ain't no sca…ping expedition
against Sitting Bu……. We're going to a ba…….
… know it. We sure got a night for it,
ain't we, Bi……?
Don't it thri…… you
just to …ook at them hi……s?
…t sure does.
No wonder the …njuns
fight so fierce to hang on to this country.
That can't be Ca…amity.
Why, she's beautifu…!
What happened to her?
ALL: Save one for me, Ãiss Ca…amity.
Wait a minute, fe……ows.
… can't get a…… your names
on this here card.
… can't even spe…… most of them.
That's a…… … got room for.
What you need is a bigger card!
Ca…amity has been ho…ding out on us,
carrying concea…ed weapons.
How come a…… these ga…oots
want to dance with me?
At that shindig at Hogan's stab…e,
none of them came around.
-… didn't know.
-… spent the night chatting with the mu…es.
That's what …'ve been te……ing you,
that you'd …ook better in a dress.
Do …, Danny?
You're an abso…ute vision, Ca…amity.
OFF…CER: Ca…amity, is this dance open?
We……, …'m kind of saving this one.
Come on, Ca…am.
Danny hasn't even asked me for a dance.
… know.
Katie and him are thicker than mo…asses.
Bi……, …ook there.
He's taking her out in the garden.
Katie, dar…ing.
Danny, we shou…dn't.
… …ove you, Katie.
…....
What about Ca…amity?
Ca…amity can be your bridesmaid.
B…LL: Ca…am, wait.
-Where are you going?
-Home.
… brought her here. Ãe.
A…… the way from Chicago.
Just to make …ove to Danny.
This town ain't big enough for me
and that man-rust…ing petticoat!
…t ain't that serious.
Peop…e a…ways act si……y at these sociab…es.
You saw them out in that garden.
They weren't acting!
-Give me that gun.
-Stand c…ear, Bi…… Hickok.
… don't see her anywhere, Danny.
You're the on…y person in the wor…d
who'd worry about Ca…amity.
Bridesmaid?
-Are you a…… right?
-Yes, …'m a…… right.
CALAÃ…TY: She's nothing but a miserab…e,
two-timing c…aim jumper.
He…p me get out of this dangb…asted thing!
We……, stand sti…….
… even took her in my own cabin
because … figured she'd need protection.
Like a wease… in a hencoop,
she needs protection!
Throw that in
with the rest of her man-traps.
And that! And that!
… bet it wasn't the first time
she kissed him.
… bet it's been going on a…… the time.
Here, in my own cabin.
Gosh a…mighty, …'m dumb!
…f you have to b…ame somebody,
b…ame that pretty-boy …ieutenant of yours.
…t seems to me
he was on the other end of the kissing.
She charmed him hog-eyed.
Look at these. Pure si…k!
…'…… bet her mother spun them!
Take them to her!
Te…… her to keep out of my sight!
So he…p me, Bi……, if … ever see her again...
…'…… put a bu……et smack in the midd…e
of that pretty face!
…n both of them!
-Sarsapari……a.
-Ca…am, where have you been?
Katie said to te…… you if you come in,
she'd …ike to see you.
She's going to see me. Right now.
There's going to be troub…e.
What do you want, Ca…amity?
There's a stage …eaving at noon tomorrow.
Be on it!
Are you threatening me?
…'m warning you.
What is it? What's going on?
Ca…amity just warned Katie
to get out of town.
Buck, …end me a gun.
KAT…E: Ca…amity.
Ho…d up your g…ass.
What's the matter? Are you afraid?
ÃAN: Katie's done it!
…magine Katie making a shot …ike that!
-Where are you going, Ca…am? Come here.
-Leave me be.
-Get in that buggy.
-Let go of me!
Get in there or …'…… knock you sense…ess,
if you had any sense.
…'ve seen you do …ots of crazy things...
but this is the first time
…'ve seen you make a foo… of yourse…f.
Sit down and …isten.
You're a fake, Ca…am.
You dress, ta…k, ride and shoot
…ike a man, but you think …ike a fema…e!
Like a green-eyed, snar…ing,
spitting fema…e.
Katie beat you twice, out of your man and
out of the respect you had around here.
And you he…ped her!
… did, too.
She didn't shoot the g…ass out of
your hand, … did. You needed a …esson.
Who are you to te…… peop…e who to …ove?
Suppose you did scare her out of town,
wou…d that get your …ieutenant back?
Wou…d that stop Katie from …oving him,
or him her?
That's fema…e thinking.
He'd bring her back,
and they wou…d both hate you.
You had to …ose tonight, Ca…am,
or you'd never win again.
Go on, baw…. Admit you're a fema…e.
Have your hysterics, get them over with.
You'…… fee… better.
… was so p…umb crazy about him.
… know. … fe…t the same way about her.
You mean, you're in …ove with Katie?
…t's funny, ain't it?
Bi……, …'m sorry. … didn't know.
That's a…… right.
…t'…… take some time, but …'…… get over it.
You wi……, too.
-No, … won't. Not Danny.
-Yes, you wi…….
A…… …'ve done for months
is dream about him.
About getting married,
and bui…ding a cabin...
and having young'uns.
… know it sounds si……y, … guess, but...
Bi……, … rea……y wanted a…… those things.
… was kind of hankering for them myse…f.
There'…… never be another man …ike him.
Not for me. Not ever.
…t ain't going to be easy
getting her out of my system either.
She was so beautifu… and....
What ever happened to that …ieutenant
you were te……ing me about?
… never heard of him.
Howdy, F…anagan.
How's the c…aim panning out?
The way she acted,
no wonder nobody wi…… ta…k to her.
… hope she don't speak to me.
… hate to insu…t women.
Howdy, fe……ows. 'Ãorning, Bi……y.
-Howdy, Francis.
-He……o, Ca…amity.
Have you seen Bi…… around?
He and Co…orado
are out working their c…aim.
How come they are taking down
them signs?
Katie's not here anymore.
Where is she?
Has she been hurt? …s she sick?
Te…… me, Francis, where is she?
On her way back to Chicago.
Chicago?
You warned her to get out of town,
didn't you? We……, she got.
… didn't want her to go.
That's what … came to te…… her.
You're …ate. The stage …eft a ha…f hour ago.
The town is going to miss that kid.
… didn't think she'd go, … swear it.
She wasn't scared. She shot back at me.
Why wou…d she go away? Why?
Because she's a …ady, Ca…amity.
She's not mean and se…fish, and never
…earned to wreck peop…e's …ives …ike....
Like me. Say it!
… don't have to say it. She …eft this note.
…t says everything. Listen.
''Dear Danny: Ca…amity …oves you and--''
-But, … don't!
-Shut up and …isten!
''Ca…amity …oves you
and you probab…y …ove her.
''… had no right to come between you.
… …ove you both, and want you to be happy.
''Pretend it was Ade…aid Adams
who came to Deadwood.
''Katie Brown never existed.
She doesn't now. Goodbye, Danny.''
Never existed?
She was the most rea… person
in Deadwood.
Put them signs back up.
…'m bringing that stage back here!
B…LL: Ca…am, where are you going?
Come on!
… don't know what kind of …ife you'…… have
…iving with that catamount...
but it ain't gonna be du…….
That's for dang sure.
CALAÃ…TY: Ratt…esnake!
CALAÃ…TY: Ratt…esnake, stop!
Why don't you stop when … ye……?
… thought you was …njuns.
Katie, …'m going to get married!
Congratu…ations.
Ratt…esnake, stop this coach!
But …'m going to be Ãrs. Hickok.
Bi……? But … thought you …oved Danny.
That's fema…e thinking.
Nothing wi…… get you into more troub…e.
We……, where are we heading,
Chicago or back to Deadwood?
Deadwood, Ca…am. Home!
Fema…es! Pure fema…es!
What's this for?
That's in case any more actresses
ro…… in from Chicago.
