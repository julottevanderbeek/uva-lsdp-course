MAN: Walk!
WOMAN: Walk, please. Don't run. Don't run.
- Hey, behave yourself!
-Quiet! Quiet!
Hey, slow down!
WOMAN: Come on, you know the rules.
On the right. I can see you.
Some folks dream of the wonders they'll do
They hide their hopes
and their heads in the sand
Spent all of their days
in the fields with sheep
He was also known as Israel,
but most of the time
Reuben was the eldest
of the children of Israel
Dad!
Hi, Dad.
Joseph's mother
She was quite my favourite wife
Through young Joseph
Jacob lived his youth again
Loved him, praised him
Gave him all he could, but then
He just saw in Joseph
all his dreams come true
Jacob wanted to show the world
he loved his son
To make it clear
that Joseph was the special one
Joseph's coat was elegant
The cut was fine
The tasteful style
was the ultimate in good design
It's great!
It was red and yellow and green
and brown and blue
Joseph's brothers weren't too pleased
with what they saw
NARRATOR:
It was red and yellow and green and brown
And purple and white and pink and orange
and blue!
Joseph's coat annoyed his brothers
Are the things that Joseph tells us
of the dreams he's often had
I dreamed that in the fields one day
the corn gave me a sign
Your eleven sheaves of corn
all turned and bowed to mine
My sheaf was quite a sight to see
A golden sheaf and tall
Yours were green and second-rate
and really rather small
ALL: Small!
This is not the kind of thing
we brothers like to hear
It seems to us that Joseph
and his dreams should disappear
Bowing down before my star
It made me wonder why
Could it be that I was born
for higher things than you?
A post in someone's government?
A ministry or two?
The dreams of our dear brother
are the decade's biggest yawn
His talk of stars and golden sheaves
is just a load of corn
Not only is he tactless,
but he's also rather dim
For there's eleven of us
and there's only one of him
- The dreams of course will not come true
-
Means that Joseph someday soon
will rise above us all
Next day, far from home,
the brothers planned the repulsive crime
Let us grab him now
Do him in while we've got the time
Hi, guys! Hey!
- Hey!
-Kill him!
NARRATOR: This they did
and made the most of it
Let us leave him here all alone
and he's bound to die
When some lshmaelites,
a hairy crew, came riding by
Things look bad for you
Hey, whatcha gonna do?
Things look bad for you
Hey, whatcha gonna do?
slave,
you hairy bunch of lshmaelites?
Young, strong, well-behaved
Going cheap, and he reads and writes
Then the lshmaelites
galloped off with a slave in tow
Off to Egypt
where Joseph was not keen to go
Joseph's brothers tore
his precious multicoloured coat
Having ripped it up,
they next attacked a passing goat
They dipped his coat in blood
and guts and gore
You make a sordid group
Hey, how low can you stoop?
- If he had not laid down his life
-Goldarnit, goldarnit
Joseph, the things that you stood for
Like truth and light, never...
Joseph was taken to Egypt in chains
Where he was bought
by a captain named Potiphar
Pyramids.
Oh, I did.
Who found he liked his master
Consequently worked much harder
Potiphar could see that
Joseph was a cut above the average
Made him leader of his household
Maximum promotion
He would have to tell her
that she still was his
You're mine!
Had attracted her attention
Every morning she would beckon...
Come and lie with me, love.
Joseph wanted to resist her
Till one day she proved too eager
Please, stop! I don't believe in free love!
Pity.
Please.
No,no,no.
When he heard a mighty rumpus
clattering above him
Suddenly, he knew his riches
couldn't buy him what he wanted
Gold would never make him happy
if she didn't love him
The things you have done
are beyond the pale
Things ain't going well
Hey, locked up in a cell
Things ain't going well
Hey, locked up in a cell
Hang on now, Joseph
You'll make it someday
Don't give up, Joseph
Fight till you drop
Hang on now, Joseph
You'll make it someday
Don't give up, Joseph
Wait and you'll see
We don't think that we will ever
see the light of day again
I picked some grapes
and I crushed them to wine
I gave them to Pharaoh,
who drank from my cup
Sad to say your dream is
not the kind of dream I'd like to get
Go, go, Joe
Go, go, Joe
Hang on now, Joseph
You'll make it someday
Hang on now, Joseph
You'll make it someday
Go, go, go, Joe!
Go, go, go, Joe!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, Joseph
You know what they say
Hang on now, Joseph
You'll make it someday
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, Joseph
You know what they say
Hang on now, Joseph
You'll make it someday
- Ahead of your time
-Ahead of my time
- Ahead of your time
-Ahead of my time
- Ahead of your time
-Ahead of my time
With the ancient world
in the palm of his hand
Whatever he did
He was showered with praise
If he cracked a joke
Then you chortled for days
In fact, you might say
he was fairly right-wing
- There's a glimmer of light
-Glimmer of light
Have shattered the sleep
of both peasants and kings
Could be famous
Could be a big success
Could be famous
Could be a big success
Could be famous
Could be a big success
- A star
-Could be famous, could be a big success
a
Star
Guess what?
In his bed, Pharaoh had an uneasy night
He had had a dream
that pinned him to his sheets with fright
Who is hot on dreams
Could explain old Pharaoh's tale
- Pharaoh said
-Fetch this Joseph man
Dreams are haunting you
Hey, whatcha gonna do?
Well, I was wandering along
the banks of the river
And then the thin cows ate the fat cows
Which I thought would do 'em good
But it didn't make 'em fatter
Like I thought a monster supper should
Because the thin cows were as thin
as they had ever, ever, ever been
This dream has got me baffled
Hey, Joseph, what does it mean?
I was standing doing nothing
in a field out of town
They were ripe, they were golden
But you've guessed it, right behind them
There were seven other ears
that were tattered and torn
Then the bad corn ate the good corn
Man, they came up from behind
But, Joseph, here's the punch line
It's really gonna blow your mind
Because the bad corn was as bad
as it had ever, ever, ever, ever been
Treat me nice
Tell me what it means
I understand the bit about the corn,
but I'm not quite sure about the cows.
I was wondering if you could just give it
to me one more time, Mr Pharaoh man.
Please?
Let me show you
how we rock and roll in Egypt.
I was standing doing nothing
in a field out of town
They were ripe, they were golden,
but you've guessed it, right behind them
There were seven other ears
that were tattered and torn
And they came up from behind
Yes, they did
But, Joseph, here's the punch line
It's really gonna blow your mind
Because the bad corn was as bad
as it had ever, ever, ever, ever been
Treat me nice
Tell me what it means
Seven years of bumper crops
are on their way
Years of plenty,
endless wheat and tons of hay
Egypt's luck will change
completely overnight
And I'm sure it's crossed your mind
What it is you have to find
ALL: Oh!
Well, stone the crows
This Joseph is a clever kid
Who'd have thought that 14 cows
could mean the things he said they did?
Joseph, you must help me further
I have found a job for you
You shall lead us through this crisis
You shall be my number two
Pharaoh told his guards to
fetch a chisel from the local store
Whereupon he ordered them
to cut the chains that Joseph wore
Joseph got a royal pardon
And a host of splendid things
A chariot of gold, a cloak,
a medal and some signet rings
- Joseph
-Joseph
- Pharaoh's number two
-Pharaoh's number two
- Joseph
-Joseph
- Egypt looks to you
-Egypt looks to you
- Joseph
-Joseph
- Egypt looks to you
-Egypt looks to you
Seven summers on the trot
were perfect, just as Joseph said
Joseph saw that food was gathered
Ready for the years ahead
Seven years of famine followed
Egypt did not mind a bit
The first recorded rationing
in history was a hit
Okay.
Hey! We were in a jam
that would have baffled Abraham
But now we're a partnership
It's just a piece of cake
Greatest man since Noah
Only goes to show-ah
Anyone from anywhere can make it
if they get a lucky break
This could be a happy ending
Perfect place to stop the show
Joseph after all has gone
about as far as he can go
But I'm sure that Jacob
and his other sons have crossed your mind
Canaan?
How lovely.
Et bien, raise your berets
to those Canaan days
Ooh la la!
Et bien, raise your berets
to those Canaan days
Those Canaan days we used to know,
where have they gone?
Where did they go?
bien, raise your berets
to those Canaan days.
- It's funny but
-Since we lost
- We've gone to the other
-Extreme
- Perhaps he wasn't
-Quite that bad
- And how we miss his
-Entertaining
So, back in Canaan the future looked rough
They've got corn, they've got meat
They've got fruit and drinks
And if we have the time
We could see the Sphinx
- So they finally decided to go
-Here we go!
I dreamed that in the fields one day
the corn gave me a sign
Your eleven sheaves of corn
all turned and bowed to mine
How do I know where you come from?
You could be spies
Telling me that you are hungry
That could be lies
Why do you think I should help you?
Would you help me?
Yes!
Why on Earth should I believe you?
I've no guarantee
We are just eleven brothers
Good men and true
Though we know we count for nothing
when up next to you
Life is slowly ebbing from us
Hope's almost gone
It's getting very hard to see us
from sideways on
I rather like the way you're talking
Astute and sincere
All this tugging at my heartstrings
seems quite justified
I shall give you what you came for
and lots more besides
Thank you, thank you
Cringe, bow, stoop, fall
Then, unseen,
Joseph nipped out around the back
Joseph turned to them all
with a terrible stare and said...
No!
No! No, no, no!
- Stop!
-You robbers, your little number's up
One of you has stolen
my precious golden cup
Joseph started searching
through his brothers' sacks
-ls it Reuben?
-No!
- Is it Simeon?
-No!
- Is it Naphtali?
-No!
- Is it Dan?
-No!
- Is it Asher?
-No!
- Is it Issachar?
-No!
- Is it Levi?
-No!
Who's the man?
- Is it Zebulun?
-No!
- Is it Gad?
-No!
- Is it Judah?
-No!
Is it him?
Could it be, could it be?
Could it be, could it be?
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Guards, seize him!
Lock him in a cell
Show him some mercy
O mighty one, please
He would not do this
He must have been framed
They're singing,
"Man, you know, you got it wrong"
- Oh, yes
-Oh, yes
- It's true
- It's true
- No ifs
-No ifs
- No buts
-No buts
- Oh, no
-Oh, no
- Not he
-Not he
- Save him
-Save him
- Take me
-Take me
- Oh, no
-Oh, no
- Not he
-Not he
- Save him
-Save him
- Take me
-Take me
Show him some mercy
O mighty one, please
He would not do this
He must have been framed
- I wore my coat
- CHILDREN: I wore my coat
- And in the east
- CHILDREN: And in the east
- And the dream is, too
- CHILDREN: And the dream is, too
- The world and I
-CHILDREN: The world and I
amazing
