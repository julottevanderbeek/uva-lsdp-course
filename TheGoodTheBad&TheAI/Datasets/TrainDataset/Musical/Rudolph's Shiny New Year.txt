"You know Rudolph,
who guided and pulled Santa's sleigh
"And who saved Christmas
by lighting the way
And it all began
on that very same foggy night.
What's this?
Why, it's from Father Time.
My old friend.
"Dear Santa, I am in terrible trouble!
"You must help me!
"The old year ends in a week.
"But this time there may not be
another year to follow!
"Happy, the Baby New Year, is...
"...missing!"
Why, that's terrible!
If the Baby New Year isn't found...
...the old year will just keep going on...
...and on, and it will be
December 31 forever!
I'll send out a search party at once!
But wait!
Nobody could find their way anywhere
in all this dark fog and snow!
Nobody, that is, except...
...Rudolph!
Once more, the happiness
of all the world's children depends on you!
You must find the Baby New Year!
And you've less than a week
in which to do it!
You mean...
Rudolph, with your nose so bright...
...you've six days left to set things right!
I'll do my best, Santa!
Yes, Happy, the Baby New Year
was missing.
And Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
was on his way to see me...
...before starting on his journey
to find the Baby New Year.
I'm Father Time.
"What do I do?" you ask.
I do what all fathers do.
I take care of things.
The time, mostly.
All the time in the universe.
I keep everything in tip-top,
tick-tock shape.
Slowpoke.
But most of all,
I make certain that every January 1...
...we have a bright and happy New Year!
That's why I was so upset
to find little Happy missing.
But Rudolph...
...well, he just...
Hold on. I'm getting ahead of myself.
Running a little fast, as it were.
Back please, back.
To the night Rudolph set out alone...
...and was soon joined by General Ticker...
...one of my most trustworthy officers.
A real clockwork soldier.
Come on, General Ticker. You can make it.
Father Time's castle can't be too far ahead.
You're bold, sir!
I'm cold, sir!
This dashed snow!
I'm pretty cold, too.
Don't weaken!
Your beacon...
...must cast its glow!
Don't worry! I won't weaken!
And finally, with great effort,
they reached the edge of a great desert:
A desert! What do we do now?
We cross, sir.
The boss, sir, is still quite far.
Father Time's castle is
on the other side of the desert?
Oh, quite, sir! 'Tis right, sir...
...beneath that star!
That's still a long way to go!
Who are you?
How do you do?
I am the Great Quarter-Past-Five.
Father Time sent me to help you
in your journey.
The Great Quarter-Past-Five?
May I call you Quart for short?
I'd rather you didn't,
if it's all the same to you.
Hop on, please.
They were halfway
across the Sands of Time when suddenly...
What is it?
I'm seein' old Aeon!
We've got to flee!
Run! Run! Run!
All fear Aeon the Terrible!
...who had terrorized the Sands of Time
for countless ages:
There's better pickings!
It's not us he's looking for.
Who does he want?
I do fear the New Year!
Do you agree?
I certainly do.
He's out looking for Happy, too!
You see, Aeon can only live...
...until he is one aeon old.
Then he will turn into ice and snow.
How long is an aeon?
Immeasurably long.
But his aeon is finally up this December 31.
He has only six days left.
That's why he wants to capture
the Baby New Year!
To stop time!
If December 31 goes on forever,
so will he!
He'll never change to snow!
He'll never stop scaring people!
Not if we find Happy first!
Come on, Great Quarter-Past-Five!
Get us to Father Time's castle, quick!
Well, since we're being quick
about things...
...you may call me Quart!
Let's go, Quart!
"As the bell rings out
Everyone one will shout
"And with nothing less
Than much happiness
Why, it's true.
That nose of yours
is as red as my hair used to be.
They used to call me Old Red Head.
It's a pleasure to serve you, sir.
Rudolph, do you know what really happens
every New Year's Eve?
Do you know how we make the change
from one year to the next?
No, sir.
All I know is that everyone says,
"Happy New Year."
It is a happy occasion,
and a solemn one, too.
For the passing of time is awe-inspiring.
It's the one certain thing
in all the universe.
In a way it is like an old king
stepping down...
A Baby New Year starts out
every January 1...
"So treasure memories
And as midnight nears,
the old year waits...
...as all the clocks count down
his last moments.
This year, the diamond
may not come down.
But what happened to the Baby New Year?
He ran away.
You see, little Happy was
anything but happy here.
And I didn't know a thing about it.
Happy was different
from all the other little New Years.
Gaw-blimey! I can't help it!
Those bloomin' ears.
Oh, do forgive me, but...
...but that night,
poor little Happy ran away...
...and we haven't seen
hide nor hair of him since!
I wish he would have come to me.
I know just how he felt.
I bet they called him names...
...and wouldn't let him join
in any New Year games.
Do you have any idea where he went?
His nurse, Nanny Nine-O'clock,
said that he always wanted to see...
...the Archipelago of Last Years.
"Archipelago"?
What does that word mean, sir?
It's a group of islands.
The Archipelago of Last Years is
the most fantastic archipelago of all.
Far north, in the most northern
of all the northern seas...
...hidden from the rest of the world
by an everlasting icy fog.
You see, when the old year's time is done,
he retires to the Archipelago...
And the island becomes his alone.
Time stands still...
...and remains just the same
as it was during the year he reigned.
Happy may be hiding
on one of those islands...
...on one of those long-ago years.
I'll search every island if I have to.
Where do I find them?
Go to where the Sands of Time meet
the Sea of Auld Lang Syne.
A sundial in all this fog?
The arm points through the icy fog
to the Archipelago of Last Years.
...and you will find yourself
going back, back, into time.
"Just remember the good times
that you knew
"Don't remember the bad times
you've been through
Oh, no! It's Aeon!
He was determined
that Rudolph would not find Happy.
He intended to do everything
in his power...
It looked pretty bad for Rudolph.
He was on his way through the icy fog
to the Archipelago of Last Years...
...searching for Happy,
the Baby New Year...
...when Aeon the Terrible swooped down
out of the sky.
Got to go faster!
Aeon was just about to swoop down,
when...
Oh, my gosh!
Now, Rudy, don't you fret any
about that overgrown chicken.
Who are you?
Folks call me Big Ben.
Look what can I do.
Climb inside. It's safe in there.
What did you say?
I asked if you were comfortable.
Kind of hard to talk with your mouth full.
Oh sure, Big Ben.
But maybe I'd better ride on top.
Okay, suit yourself!
I won't let you find Happy...
...before I do!
You are a bad birdie.
Yes, even Aeon the Terrible
was no match for Big Ben!
By the next morning,
Big Ben had taken Rudolph...
...to just about the oldest island
in the whole Archipelago of Last Years.
It was the island where
old One Million BC had gone to retire.
While Big Ben waited for him
in the harbor...
...the little reindeer went ashore
to find old One Million himself.
Anybody home?
But certainly! Always there's anybody!
No? Yes?
Hi! You must be...
Who? Me? O.M.!
O.M.?
Short for One Million.
Too much work, all the time saying
"One Million." Yes? No? Yes!
I suppose so.
Why for the edges on your mouth go down,
not up?
I'm looking for Happy, the Baby New Year.
What if I don't find him in time?
Don't? Stop with the "don't" thoughts!
Start with the "do" thoughts!
"When things go wrong
and dark clouds fill your sky
"Let the dark clouds burst
"Laugh and you'll find if you cry
"it's raining sunshine
"it's raining sunshine
"And it's music to the ears
"it's raining sunshine
"it's raining sunshine
"When you smile away your tears
"it's raining sunshine
"it's raining sunshine
"And a rainbow soon appears
"it's raining sunshine
"it's raining sunshine
"When you smile away your tears
"it's raining sunshine
"it's raining sunshine
"it's raining sunshine"
Sounds wonderful, O.M.
I'll take your advice,
and I know I'll find Happy!
Who's happy?
Everybody's happy!
O.M., please!
Happy is the new Baby New Year!
He's missing! I thought
he might have come here.
A little baby? Oh, yeah. Yeah! Yeah!
He's here?
No.
But he was!
O.M. told Rudolph that little Happy
did visit the island.
...and misunderstanding the laughter
of his new friends...
...little Happy made himself a boat
out of a giant conch shell...
And that is the last time I have
ever seen him.
But look, let's both look!
He has positively got to be
on one of these islands, maybe.
Yes?
Okay, come on!
Big Ben is waiting!
At first, they had no luck at all.
For two days they searched...
to even talk to us.
And all 4000 BC could think about
was building pyramids!
Lots more islands! Lots more! Lots more!
But it's only three days until December 31.
Time's running short.
Maybe that island up there
will know something.
Certainly looks impressive!
Just about the most fantastic island
in the whole Archipelago!
Full of castles and princesses
and knights in shining armor.
And as soon as they landed
they met the proprietor of the island...
Thou look'st for the wee babe, Happy?
Is he here, Sir 1023?
Aye?
Where?
I've not the slightest notion in me noggin!
But come'st thou with me!
Come'st. We searcheth!
"Come'st thou with me! We searcheth!"
Clank! Clank! Clank!
And so they began to search the island,
asking everybody about Happy...
...and all the people they met.
You see 1023 was the year when
all those fairy tales we know...
...actually took place!
"What a wonderful world we live in
No, I'm sorry. I haven't seen Happy.
Have you, my dear?
I saw him! Made me laugh so hard
I fell off the wall!
- But where is he?
- Dunno.
When all the king's horses
and all the king's men started to laugh...
...he ran off.
- Not hide nor hair!
- No baby around here!
All seven say no!
But he ran away from me!
No baby ever wants to stay with me!
So neareth and yet so fareth!
Little did they know, but Baby Happy
was nearer than anyone suspected.
Happy looked clown and saw just about
the friendliest little house that ever was.
Nobody was home inside,
but everything was as neat as a pin.
He was very hungry.
And there on the table he spied...
So he decided to sit down
and enjoy breakfast.
He broke it! Whoever owns this house
is not going to like that!
But Happy was too tired
to care about anything...
...and so he went upstairs,
where he was sure there were some beds.
But meanwhile, the owners of the cottage
were coming home!
Yes, little Happy, the New Year,
had gone to sleep...
...in the cottage of a family of bears.
Three bears.
There was the Papa Bear,
the Momma Bear, and the Baby Bear.
Someone's been sitting in my chair!
Someone's been sitting in my chair!
Someone's been sitting in my chair.
And it got broke!
Somebody broke my chair!
Someone's been tasting my porridge!
Someone's been tasting my porridge!
Someone ate mine all up!
Someone's been sleeping in our beds!
In mine too!
And there he is!
Well, what do you know?
He's sweet.
He'd make a nice friend!
You want to be my little friend?
We could play make up games! All kinds.
Knights and Dragons.
You can be the knight!
And Crusaders! That's a great game!
Okay, friend?
I guess that's the most important thing
in the world, isn't it?
Another mouth to feed?
Junior needs a friend.
Well, I don't imagine he eats much.
At least he likes porridge!
Now, I must be the dragon.
Now, you slay me.
Go ahead. Hit me, not too hard,
but you hit me.
Go ahead, it's only a game, you know.
Oh, you got me! I'm all slayed!
Now you must doff your helmet
in triumph!
You know, take off your hat.
But you've got to!
That's the way the game goes!
Goodness, you got to play the game right.
Fine friend you are!
Well, Happy didn't want to lose his friend.
And he realized that...
...when you play a game,
you have to follow the rules.
Goodness, look at that!
Boy, I've never seen nothing
like that before!
It was just like always.
Those bears didn't mean to be cruel...
...but they just couldn't stop laughing
at those ears.
Hey! Where you going? Come back!
Come back! You're my friend!
It's dangerous in those woods all alone!
Happy! Where are you?
Come on, Happy, don't hide!
Happy!
Happy!
Happy, where are you?
Happy, don't hide!
We're here to help you!
He's got to be somewhere.
Look ye! Up yonder!
Aeon says not to worry!
I'll be your friend!
You'll like living with me!
Oh, no!
Come on!
We can't let them out of our sight!
I hope Big Ben can swim fast!
Good old Big Ben. He could swim
almost as fast as Aeon could fly.
They're getting away from us!
Ben! Do something!
You bet your boots I will!
Watch out now! Watch your heads!
He fell off!
But suddenly, a vagrant wind blew him
out of sight.
He's lost again!
And we only have two days left!
That old wind held the Baby New Year
aloft for more than a day.
And Happy came down
on still another island.
Well, hello there, little fellow. I'm 1776!
But my friends call me Sev.
Would you be my friend?
Don't know who you are
or where you come from...
...but you're welcome to join
our big Fourth of July celebration.
I know you think it's December 30,
but not on this island.
No, sirree!
On this island,
every day is the Fourth of July.
Come on! You're just in time
for the big parade!
"There's a happy celebration
In each town across the nation
"Oh, it's grand just to be
Inside a land that is free
"The birthday of the USA
and take a picnic on your way
"Soon you'll hear the bands
as they begin to play
"With the drum a-ra-ta tapping
And the firecrackers snapping
"Oh, it's grand just to be
Inside a land that is free
Hey, little fella. Your hat!
Got to show respect for the flag.
The parade's over on that next block!
Gadzooks!
I'm certain it was Happy we saw.
Those ears!
Oh, no!
We're too late!
It happened again!
I feel terrible. We didn't mean to be cruel.
Those ears! Those ears!
But, you can count on me
to help you look for him.
Methinks that sounds like...
Methinks, too! Sounds like! Looks like!
Smells like! It is...
There, there. I'll take you home with me.
With me!
Aeon's tricked him again!
Poor little Happy thinks Aeon is
the only friend he has in the world!
We must pursue them!
Yes, we must after them
to the ends of the Earth!
Here, victory's ours!
For each dawn we die!
We must after them!
But how? It's night? We can't see a thing!
That's where I come in!
Come on, men!
We've got one day till New Years!
This is our last chance!
And so Aeon the Terrible flew off
with Happy, the Baby New Year...
...taking him back to his dismal home
on the Island of No Name.
...more like a haunted iceberg
than an island...
...due north of the North Po! E,
where the sun never shines.
You'll never be found here,
and I will live forever.
But Rudolph and his friends
hadn't ended the search.
Big Ben knew the way
to the Island of No Name...
...and Rudolph's red nose
lit up that foggy, rainy night...
...like a magic beacon
in an ocean of gloom and despair.
We will rescue him in time? Yes? No?
No!
It looks bad for Happy.
'Tis...
...hopeless!
Come on! Nothing is ever hopeless.
We'll find Happy.
But how can you be so sure?
I got you this far, didn't I?
"Have a little faith in me
"And day by day
"I'll make your dreams all come true
"Have a little faith in me
"And as they say
"Faith can move mountains for you
"I'll lend a helping hand
"When things go wrong
"And by your side I'll stand
"As I help along
"Have a little faith in me
"That's all I ask
"I'll keep the faith faithfully"
Look! It really is...
...raining sunshine.
Well, by George! Look up yonder!
Look what Rudolph's nose lit the way to!
The Island of No Name.
Now, Rudy...
...so as old Aeon don't see us coming,
you'd better douse your nose!
But keep that hope burning bright inside!
Okay, Big Ben.
What's that for?
Look at my clock.
New Years Eve.
Zounds, gadzooks, and odd bodkins.
We have but one half-hour!
We've got to be quick, then!
Come on, men! Let's get Happy!
Inch by inch, they made their way
up the tower of ice and snow...
You!
And the awful sound he made
caused an avalanche...
...which tumbled down onto Rudolph
and the others...
They're all buried alive!
Your last hope is gone!
And you'll live here with me as my slave!
And all time will stop!
And I will never turn into ice and snow!
Safe at last!
Aeon was so comforted by his success
that he snuggled down...
...into his nest and drifted off
into a contented sleep...
And, indeed it did look as if
everything was over for Rudolph...
Come on, Rudolph! You can do it!
Make that nose really glow!
Now, to find Happy!
Hi.
My name is Rudolph.
Wait a minute. Don't be afraid.
I want to be your friend.
You think you can't have any friends?
Why not?
Come on. You can tell me.
Is it because of your ears?
Heck, they couldn't be that bad.
Do you want to see something?
Look.
Go ahead. Laugh right out.
Doesn't bother me any more.
But when I was little,
it sure gave me one heck of a time.
You mean, you never heard about me?
Well, Rudolph was too modest
to tell his own story.
And so all the trees on the old mountain,
and the snowflakes...
...why, they just helped him out.
"You know Dasher and Dancer
and Prancer and Vixen
You see, I stuck it out,
and when I grew older I found that...
...this nose was the most wonderful thing
in the whole world.
Because it was a different nose
from everybody else's.
And it was all mine. It was really me!
You know, with those ears...
...why, you're going to be
the happiest New Year ever!
Come on, Happy.
Let's see those old ears of yours.
Come on! We're friends, aren't we?
Now, don't get upset because I laughed.
I couldn't help myself.
Those ears made me feel so wonderful
that all the happiness inside me...
...just had to pop out.
Same way with everybody else.
Those ears of yours...
...why, they make folks happy!
Happy!
You!
I have an idea, Happy!
Take off your hat, quick!
Take it off for good!
Those ears.
Those ears!
Those ears!
Those ears!
It was the first time that monstrosity
ever laughed in his life.
He laughed so hard that he laughed himself
right out of his nest.
He laughed himself right down the side
of that mountain.
Old Aeon won't give us any trouble now.
He's cured for good.
Nobody can turn to snow and ice when
he's all warmed up inside with laughing.
True!
That's true!
Midnight!
Even though we found Happy,
we're too late!
Don't give up hope! There must be
some way to get back...
...to Father Time's castle
before the twelfth bong!
There sure is, Rudolph!
It's Santa Claus!
If I can travel all over the world
in one night...
...I ought to be able to get you
to Father Time in a few bongs!
They traveled faster than joy itself,
over the Sands of Time...
"As the bells ring out
Everyone will shout
"Happy New Year
"Have a happy, have a happy
"May each day be filled with good cheer
"And with nothing less
Than much happiness
"All through the year
"Should auld acquaintance be forgot
"Have a happy, have a happy
"Never have a worry or fear
"Here's my wish for you
Hope my wish comes true
"Happy New Year
"Have a Happy
"Happy New Year"
Happy New Year!
And may it be shiny, too!
