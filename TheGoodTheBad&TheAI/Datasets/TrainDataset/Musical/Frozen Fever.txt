ELSA:
Stiff.
Come on, Elsa, this is for Anna.
You can do this.
KRISTOFF:
Relax! It looks great.
I just want it to be perfect.
Speaking of perfect, check this out.
Kristoff, are you sure I can
leave you in charge here?
Absolutely.
Because I don't want anything
to happen to this courtyard.
What could happen? It's all set.
Olaf, what are you doing?
I'm not eating cake.
- Olaf...
- But it's an ice cream cake!
- And it's for Anna.
- And it's for Anna.
-
-
- Oh, it's time!
- It's time! For what?
Okay...
- You sure you got this?
- I'm sure.
- Don't let anyone in before we're ready.
- I won't.
- And don't touch anything.
- I'm just gonna stand here.
- I'm probably gonna walk around a little.
- And keep an eye on that cake!
She thinks you're an idiot!
Well, clearly she's wrong!
- What? It's fine.
- I can't read... or spell.
- Anna!
- Yeah?
Happy birthday.
It's your birthday!
- It's my birthday.
- Come on!
- It's my birthday?
- And it's going to be perfect because...
Except, of course, the ones
just spent outside my locked door
So I'm here way too late
to help you celebrate.
:
I don't get colds, besides...
- ANNA: Fancy.
- ELSA: Just follow the string.
Wait, what?
I've got big plans,
I've got surprises for today
Nothing but nothing's
gonna get in our way
I've worked for weeks
planned everything within my power
I even got Kristoff and Sven
to take shower
-
- TOY OLAF:
I'm giving you the sun,
the moon and the sky
Little brothers!
- ELSA:
- ANNA:  Ooh, sandwich!
I'm making today a blast
if it's the last thing I do
For everything you are to me
and all you've been through
- ANNA: They come in threes!
- ELSA: I'm fine.
You've got me reeling
but I'm still concerned for you
I think it's time that you go home
and get some rest
We are not stopping
'cause the next one is the bes--
ANNA:
ELSA:
ANNA:
Are you sick? How 'bout a cold remedy
of my own invention
- No thanks.
- We'll take it.
-
-
We're singing a birthday song
to make your wishes come true
-
-
So we're making today a perfect day
A fabulous day in every way
I can fix it.
No, no!
All fixed!
"Dry banana hippy hat"?
ELSA :
Come on. Now we climb!
ANNA :
Elsa, that's too much. You need to rest.
We need to get to our birthday chills,
I mean thrills.
ELSA :
Follow the string to the end
You are my very best friend
- Elsa?
-
Happy, happy, happy
Merry, merry, merry
Elsa, look at you. You've got a fever.
You're burning up.
I'm sorry, Anna. I just wanted
to give you one perfect birthday,
but I ruined it. Again.
You didn't ruin anything.
Let's just get you to bed.
Surprise!
- ANNA: Wow!
- ELSA: Wow...
OLAF :
We're making today a smiley face
all shiny and new
- There's a fine line between chaos
- And a hullabaloo
We're making today a perfect day
Making today a perfect day
-
- Happy birthday.
-
- I love you baby!
-
- I do.
We're making today a perfect day
Making today a perfect day
- Perfect day!
- Okay. To bed with you.
Wait, wait. All that's left to do is for
the queen to blow the birthday bugle horn.
No, no, no, no, no...
- Best birthday present ever.
- Which one?
You letting me take care of you.
This way, Sludge and Slush and Slide
and Ansel and Flake and Fridge
and Flurry and Powder and Crystal
and Squall and Pack and Sphere
- and William!
- Don't ask.
