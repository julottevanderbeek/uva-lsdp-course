I was a girl in the village
doing all right
Then I became
a princess overnight
Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right
So much to learn
and see
Up in the castle
with my new family
In a school that's
just for royalty
A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me
-  I'm so excited to be
-  Sofia the first
I'm finding out what
being royal's all about
Sofia the first
Making my way,
it's an adventure every day
Sofia
-  It's gonna be my time
-  Sofia
To show them all
that I'm Sofia the first
Oh, this is the one.
Stop here, please.
But, Princess, who would
hold a party here?
- Witches.
- Sofia!
Hi, Lucinda.
I'm ready for
your cauldronation.
Hmm. Not yet.
Witch-a-doodle-do.
Okay, now you're ready.
Oh, look at this outfit.
So witchy.
There's still tons
to set up. Come on.
Whoa!
SOFIA: This looks amazing.
Thanks, but I think we need
to put out more newts.
Lots more newts.
Oh, they're so... festive.
I think so, too.
So, I've never been to
a cauldronation.
What is it exactly?
It's a really special ceremony
where I have to prove that
I'm ready to be a witch.
How do you do that?
By making a powerful broom
called the raven catcher.
Your newt's running away.
Oh... ahhh! Thanks.
It's taken me a long time
to learn the spells and potion
that give the raven catcher
its magic.
Sounds like
a lot of work.
It is, but it's worth it.
If everything goes well,
when I take off
on my raven catcher broom
just as the moon
rises tonight,
everyone will see
I'm not Lucinda
the little witch anymore.
They will see that I'm
Lucinda the midnight witch!
That's what big witches
are called.
You must be nervous.
I am, and not just because
I have to make a powerful broom.
Here. Help me hang
these cobwebs?
What I'm most nervous about
is picking a witch of honor.
What's a witch of honor?
It's a special witch friend
I have to choose
to help me make a potion
at the end of the ceremony.
I'm trying to decide
between Indigo,
my best bad witch friend,
or Lily, my best
good witch friend.
Oh. Tough choice.
Especially since Indigo
and Lily are complete opposites.
I'm afraid they're not gonna
get along at the party.
And whoever I don't
choose to be my witch of honor,
is probably gonna
get really upset.
Like, witch upset.
And ruin your special day?
Right.
Well, what if I keep
an eye on Lily and Indigo,
and make sure that
they get along today,
no matter what?
You'd do that?
I'd be happy to.
I just want your cauldronation
to go well, Lucinda.
Thanks, Sofia.
I'm really glad
you're here.
Me, too.
- What was that?
- More guests.
Lucinda! Hi, Lucy-woosey!
That's Lily, my good witch
friend I was telling you about.
Think fast.
And I'm guessing that's
your bad witch friend Indigo.
Yep.
Lucinda!
I'm so excited
for your big day.
Wanna see the cauldronation
present I got you?
Kitty-ocity!
Aw, I love it!
Thanks, Lily.
Do I know
my best friend or what?
So have you picked
your witch of honor yet?
Uh, not yet.
Then I will make it
easy for you.
Pick me, your oldest,
bestest,
and way baddest
friend.
The one who knows what type
of cat you really like.
Bad-cat-eous.
- You're welcome.
- Silly Indigo.
Lucinda's a good witch now.
She prefers cute,
fluffy cat.
Is that so?
I think both cats
are great,
so no need to argue, okay?
Who are you?
You don't act like
a bad witch.
And you don't look like
a good witch.
This is my friend Sofia.
I'm just a princess...
in witches' clothing.
Oh, that's cute.
I think the ceremony's starting
soon, isn't it, Lucinda?
Uh, yes, it is.
You two should go find
a good spot by the candles.
Good luck, Lucinda.
I know you'll make
the best raven catcher
broom ever,
and I say that as your
super duper best friend
who'd love to be
your witch of honor.
So pick me.
Unless you want a really
wicked witch of honor.
Then pick me.
Let's go, Lucinda.
You weren't kidding.
They really don't get along.
Oh, maybe I should've
only invited one of them.
If they're your
best friends,
you were right
to invite them both.
I won't let them
ruin your special day.
Don't worry.
Thanks, Sofia.
WOMAN: Time to start
the ceremony, witches.
- Oh, Sofia.
- Hi. Mrs. Wicked Witch.
I'm so glad you could
make Lucinda's big day.
You ready, honey wart?
As much as
I'll ever be.
Welcome,
young witchlings,
to Lucinda's cauldronation!
The ritual will begin
with Lucinda lighting
the cauldronation candle.
Okay. Here goes.
Fire, fire,
burning bright,
ignite the candle's
light tonight.
Oh, that's a good shot.
So is that one.
Mom! The ceremony.
In a second, sweetie.
I just want to capture
every witchy moment
of this special
witchy day.
Now give me your best
"I'm almost a midnight
witch" smile!
Perfect.
Now then, it's
cauldronation
tradition
for everyone to help
gather straw from
a scarecrow
for Lucinda to use
in her raven catcher broom.
To the pumpkin patch,
you darling doers of magic!
Hey, Luce, I'll pick enough
straw for ten brooms,
'cause I'm a great friend,
which means I'll be
a great witch of honor.
That's so sweet.
But if I pick more straw,
would that make me
an even better
witch of honor?
Probably!
Hey!
Oh, no, there
they go again.
It's okay. I think
I know a way to
keep them apart
so there won't
be any problems.
Wait. Indigo.
Let Lily have
that scarecrow.
Then you can have
that bigger one
all to yourself.
It has lots more
straw to pick.
Hm, good idea.
Come on,
girls.
- Nice going.
- Thanks.
Lucinda dear,
while everyone's
picking straw,
let's set out the ingredients
for your cauldronation potion.
Okay, Mom.
I'll go make sure
everything's okay
between Indigo
and Lily.
Oh, hold that pose.
I want to get a picture.
Say rotten cheese.
Rotten cheese.
Oh, spider fritters.
Your eyes were closed.
Could you pose again?
And this time, lean in
a bit closer
to that bottle
of bat sweat, okay?
Rotten cheese.
So far so good.
Everyone's getting along.
My best friend will have
the best broom
with all this straw
I got her.
Then she'll definitely
make me her witch of honor.
Not if I have anything
to hex about it.
Wake up-eus!
Oh, no! Indigo,
what did you do?
That's rude, Mr. Scarecrow!
This straw is for
my best friend, Lucinda.
You've got to stop this.
No, I don't think so.
Awesome hex.
Way to go, me.
Aren't you tired,
Mr. Scarecrow?
Don't you wanna
sit down?
SOFIA: They're heading for
Lucinda's backyard.
That scarecrow could wreck
all the decorations.
We've got to do
something.
Now say icky, stinky cheese.
Icky stinky cheese.
What a darling shot.
Oh, I know the perfect
spot to hang this.
Right by
the broom closet.
Back in a flash.
LILY:
This hay is Lucinda's.
Enough. It's not
polite to grab.
Uh-oh.
Please, Mr. Scarecrow,
this is not funny.
Lucinda's ingredients.
She needs those
to make her potion.
Now unhex that scarecrow.
Ugh! Okay.
Sorry, Lucinda.
It's okay. I'm just glad
you got it to stop.
I found an even better
spot for the picture.
In the divining room.
Oh, looky, it's almost
moonrise.
Come, girls. It's time for
the broomstick dance.
Bring all the straw
you collected.
Did you see the way
that they looked at
each other?
It was hard to miss.
What are they going to do
when I choose one of them
for my witch of honor?
Well, whoever you
don't choose
will just have to be
okay with it.
Now, my witchlets,
it's time for you to do
the traditional broomstick dance
around this broomstick
while Lucinda recites
the spell
that will give her
raven catcher broom its magic.
Good. Everyone split up
into pairs of two for the dance.
Pairs of two.
Lily, Indigo, why don't
you two dance together?
Are you serious?
You cannot
be serious.
Seriously?
Keeping them apart
didn't work.
Maybe if they do
something fun together,
they might get along.
I guess it's
worth a try.
Okay, yes. I'd love
you two to dance together.
And it is
my cauldronation, so...
All right, fine.
Let the broomstick dance
begin!
Now is the time
in the cauldronation
When we dance around
in celebration
A little witchy groove
Full of eerie spooky moves
Come swirl with us
and twirl with us
Join this magic
dance sensation
It's the broomstick dance
Full of spells and chants
If all goes
without a hitch
Soon we'll have
a midnight witch
The broomstick dance
The broomstick
dance
Dance!
It looks like they're
getting along, doesn't it?
I don't believe it,
but it really does.
Now we skip to the left
and slide to the right
As the day slips away
into the night
Let's dance around
her stick
Do a spell
with a little kick
To give this broom
some extra zoom
So we can fly at
the speed of light
It's the broomstick dance
Full of spells
and chants
If all goes
without a hitch
Soon we'll have
a midnight witch
The broomstick dance
The broomstick
dance
The broomstick dance
Lucinda honey,
the moon will be out soon.
Cast the spell.
Okay, Mom.
Broom of speed,
fast in flight--
Oh, Lucy-woosey,
don't you want
your witch of honor
to be a fabulous broomstick
dancer like me?
You call those dance moves?
Watch these.
Cut it out, guys.
I'm trying to do my spell.
Lucinda, hurry.
Okay.
Whistling thistles, uh...
bristles of hay... whoa!
Keep going, Lucinda.
Full of magic,
pep and might?
- Look at me, Lucinda.
- No, look at me.
How about we just stick to
the basic broomstick dance?
Rise up to the broom
and stick on okay.
My broomstick!
I was supposed to say
stick where ye may.
Ugh! I said it wrong.
Now I'm gonna have
a crooked raven catcher
for the rest of
my life.
It'll be all right, honey.
I like your broomstick.
It's unique,
just like you.
It's okay,
Lucy-woosey.
Yeah, that broomstick
is pretty wicked.
I don't mean to nudge, but it's
getting later by the minute.
I think you should pick your
witch of honor now, Lucinda.
Finally. Okay, Lucinda's gonna
pick her witch of honor now.
So, Lucinda,
who are you
going to choose?
I'm... I'm not sure.
Come on, Lu,
it's an easy choice.
Remember all the bad hexes
we did together?
But you're a good witch
now, Lucindy,
so you should have
a good witch of honor.
Me!
- Um, Lucinda.
-
- Who's it gonna be?
- Yes, who?
Okay, okay.
I choose...
- I choose Sofia.
- Her?
- Huh?!
Me?
What are
you thinking?
Can a non-witch even be
the witch of honor?
Well, nothing in
the cauldronation handbook
says a witch of honor
must be a witch.
Hm. Sofia it is.
But Lucinda,
I don't know the first thing
about being a witch of honor.
I know, but I didn't
want Lily and Indigo
to start the hex-off
of the century.
Everyone,
the moon is on the rise.
Please head over
to the cauldron.
I'm sorry. I really didn't
think she'd choose me.
Hm!
Now Lucinda, with help from
her witch of honor Sofia,
will perform the final
step of the cauldronation.
They'll brew a potion
that will complete
her raven catcher broom.
But first, Lucinda,
let's get one quick shot
of you with your
super special witch of honor.
Oh, spider socks.
I'm out of canvases.
There's more inside.
I'll be back in a jiffy.
What do I do?
Start stirring
with the broom,
and remember to keep
stirring as the moon rises.
Like this?
Yes. If all goes well,
the potion will put
a headpiece on the broom
in the shape of
my favorite animal,
an owl.
Now I will add
one speckled owl feather.
Two drops of
slug slime.
One wolf whisker.
A sprig of swamp moss.
Four knuckleberries.
That princess stole
my best friend.
You mean my best friend?
I think it's time
she goes back to her castle.
Wait, Indigo!
Powers that be,
heed what I say.
Send that princess
far away.
What's happening?
Get me down!
- Sofia!
- Time to go bye-bye, princess.
Indigo, that's Lucinda's
raven catcher broom.
Don't worry, Lucindy.
I'll get it back for you.
Turn that princess
right around.
Help!
Oh, no, you don't.
That princess who should
never have been named
witch of honor
is out of here.
I'm not a real witch!
I don't know how
to steer this thing.
But Lucindy needs
that broom.
Get me down!
Watch out!
I got more canvases.
- Uh-oh.
- Watch it.
Oh, my!
I'm okay.
But they're not.
Ha! You're an owl.
- Uh-oh.
- Yep, you are, too.
Great goblins!
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
- Oh, no!
- What happened?
The potion was supposed to
put an owl headpiece
on my broom,
not turn everyone
into owls.
My cauldronation
is ruined.
Now I'll never be
a midnight witch.
Lucinda, wait!
I can fix this.
If only I could pick up
my wand.
Nice going.
Me? I was trying
to stop you and
your mean hex.
Stop. Enough!
Both of you,
you've spent
this whole day
arguing over who is
best friends with Lucinda,
but this is not
how best friends act.
- I just wanted to be
her witch of honor.
- Me, too.
And all Lucinda wanted was for
her cauldronation to go well.
If you really wanted
to act like a good friend,
you would've thought more
about what Lucinda wants,
not about what
you want.
You're right.
We've been so...
so selfish.
Yeah, I guess
we kinda have.
What's even worse is I know
the spell to break
that owl hex, but
I can't use my wand
- with these claws.
- Same goes for me.
Maybe you can do it.
But I'm not a witch.
We'll teach you
the spell.
And show you
how to use a wand.
All right. I'll try,
but we better hurry.
It's just an itsy
flick of the wrist.
Like this?
Now repeat after us:
Wolves that howl,
cats on the prowl...
Wolves that howl,
cats on the prowl.
Bring back the witches
and be gone all these owls.
Bring back the witches
and be gone all these owls.
- You did it, Sofia!
- Way to go!
Good work fixing
one problem, girls.
But what about
Lucinda's potion?
All the ingredients
spilled.
Not to mention this mess.
And the moon's
coming out.
We need a clean-up crew
over here.
The rest of us need to
gather potion ingredients.
It would be so sweet if
you could go find slug slime,
and can you find some essence
of toadstool? Thanks.
Now there's only
one thing missing.
Lucinda.
I'm sorry, Lucinda.
I really tried to keep
Indigo and Lily
from causing trouble.
It's not your fault,
Sofia.
Indigo and Lily
are really great friends.
They're just terrible
when you put them together.
Still, I can't believe
how bad it got.
You know, it may not be
that bad after all.
How can you say that?
Come with me.
I want to show you something.
What's going on?
Here's some
crocodile tears.
New batch of
bat sweat for you.
I got you some
bug broth.
My potion ingredients?
Your friends
did this for you.
It was the least
we could do.
After, you know, ruining
your cauldronation.
We are so,
so sorry.
We spent this whole day
fighting over
who was your
best friend,
and that made us act
like really bad friends.
And not the good
kind of bad, just
the bad kind.
And we feel just awful.
It's okay.
But you're both
my best friends.
I don't want you
to fight over me.
Yeah, we know that now.
Look, Lucinda, the moon's
not totally out yet.
There's still time to
finish your raven catcher.
Only if I get help from
my witches of honor.
All three of you.
This, that, a little bit
of this.
A bit of bug broth,
some croc tears.
Three wolf whiskers.
A touch of toadstool.
The spell, honey,
quickly.
I raise my voice
as the potion is stirred.
Complete this brew
with my favorite bird.
- It worked!
- I did it!
I made a raven catcher.
I'm a midnight witch!
- Great job!
- Way to go, Lucinda!
I'm so proud of you,
my darling.
Thanks, Mom.
And I'm sorry about
taking all the pictures.
It's just that, well,
you won't be
my little witchlet much longer,
and I... I want to
remember you
before you fly off
on your own.
It's okay, Mom.
You can take as many
pictures as you want.
You know what? There's no way
I'll forget this moment.
Ever.
Nice job being
witch of honor, Sofia.
You know, you'd make
a really, really good witch.
A good bad witch,
you mean.
If you ever get sick of
the princess thing, that is.
Thank. I'll
keep it in mind.
Ready to take a test ride
on my brand-spanking-new
raven catcher?
So you like that
it's zig-zagged?
Yeah. It's one of a kind.
Oh, and you may wanna
hold on tight, Sofia.
Just how fast does
this thing go?
