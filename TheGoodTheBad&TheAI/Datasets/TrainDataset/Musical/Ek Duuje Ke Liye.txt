And if you find time,roam around
Hyderabad, look at the city's charm
Look at the beauty
you'll enjoy
And if possible,go on a
blind date...
In the evening,go for a movie
have you seen the film Pakizah?
No...
You haven't seen?Hey,what
are you upto?
Hey,that's a poem
Poem...?
Brother, where are you lost?
Aunty... I've come...
Aunty... where are you?
Hey,Chakravarthy,come...
Where are your Lotus feet,they
are here,one minute...
Let me cleanse this birth of
mine by touching your Lotus feet
And brighten the next birth
of mine
God bless you...
How is everyone in Lucknow,your
mother,your father...?
Hey,leave all those
oldies aside
Where's Sapna baby?
Hey,since morning,she's standing
on one leg and waiting for you
Look, she's here...
Sapna,look,who's come?
Come Chakravarthy,come...
Since morning, I've been waiting
only for you standing on one leg
Don't you have manners
of speaking?
Wow! I think you're a new Piegon
who has entered this hotel
My name is Baby, I stay
downstairs
My name is Vasu
- What?
My name is Vasu
Your moustache is really
wonderful
Will you come for a movie
with me in the evening?
I don't understand Hindi
very well
Boss,who goes to a movie
to understand it?
I think,I'm too fast
for you
I shouldn't have asked you
so early for a movie
I'll again ask you after
Chakravarthy,you should show
your Manliness
Aunty,then you yourself suggest
what should I do?
First,you stop sneezing
After you have come,Sapna should
slowly forget Vasu
And not only that,Vasu's name should
get erased from Sapna's heart
How's it?
Very good,my lord,very good
But,what if we change it's
alignment a little,then?
How?
That's all
It means,that's all madam
full stop
Enough of match stick play,please
come to the movie
Really,it'll be very
enjoyable
If it's not palatable
for madam
Then,madam can watch
the movie inside
And your slave will watch
the posters outside...
I'll wait for the lady
No Chakran,I've lots to do
What work do you have?
This one
Sir
- Yes!
I've a small doubt
About what?
About an agreement
There're 1 Lakh agreements
in the office-
Which one are you referring to?
Love agreement,sir
It's most important
Wonderful,I haven't seen such an
agreement in a movie also
I can't meet Sapna,I can't even
write a letter to her
If,I send her an
empty envelope
Then,what can happen?
Your love is very sincere
Love makes the world beautiful
Hey,what's all this?
You had rubbed off
only one name
See how many more have
appeared
What to do now,mother
Darling!
Daddy has seen
Shameless!
My forehead is blank,write
on that too
Dear sir
I drink
You all know & the entire
Town knows
But,I've a unique way
of drinking
Before 9 'o' clock I drink
as much as I can
But exactly at 9 'o' clock
my party gets over
It's neither at 8.59
nor at 8.61
I don't compromise on
this matter
This fact,you & the entire
city knows
Hey,Samba.. Oh Samba brother
- What is this?
Till now neither the glasses nor
the heads have broken
Why has the party not
bloomed till now?
He is simple and an
innocent boy
Oh! meet Mr. Ram Singh
he also stays in Goa
I see!
Where do you stay in Goa?
Panaji,near palm beach
light house
So cheers to our simpleton
friend
Have you come for the party?
No,I've escaped from
the party
Have you also escaped from
the party?
Mr. Danny is my elder brother
In Mr. Hari's company,I'm...
I'm the new employee
in his company
My name is Vasu
Please sit down
My name is Vasu
Why are you telling your name
again and again?
So that you tell me
your name
My name is Sandhya
Your name is very 'ACHHI'
Achhi  not Achhi
but Achha
Nice! Nice!
I don't know Hindi properly,that's why
I make grammatical mistakes
Where do you come from?
I'm a Tamilian and Tamil is
my Mother tongue
Okay,tell me...
Why the swimming pool is
like this?"TANNl EllAME"
Some people have similar
lives
Like this pool... empty
I know only two words of Tamil
Greeting and Food
I was in Madras for a week
with my husband
Oh! are you married?
Yes
It was performed & it
has also ended
In air...
My husband died in an
air crash
When a person starts life...
He forgets
That death is not very far
Whenever the lotuses of
happiness bloom
Usually they bloom in the
lake of tears
These are God's divine
plays
God gives smiles and also tears
Your Hindi is very sweet
Hindi is really sweet
Sweet...
Will you teach me Hindi?
Oh! so many names
How many will they be?
May be in thousands! because
Vasu is one among thousands
Madam,Vasu is one among thousands
I agree
But among these thousands you can
accord second place to me!Isn't it
Meaning?
I request you!
Look there! I've written my
name just once
With so much of love Chakram
Please don't erase that or else
all my desires will be erased
After one year,If Vasu doesn't
come,then...
No,no just in case
Then,atleast you can give some
thought to my name
Forgive me Sapna
I lost my balance in my
over enthusiasm
Now I promise
For your love
I'll definitely culminate
that agreement
I'm leaving this city
but Sapna..
Are you real mother or
step mother?
Step mother will not worry
about your welfare
I'm your real mother,I can even
kill you for your welfare
If your madness continues
like this...
Then,I'll kill you with my
own hands,got it
You can kill me but you can't
erase my memories
They are not in your
hands
Where are you going?
Why? Will you also come
with me?
Where ever my heart
& memories will go
Can you go every where
come
Let the ocean & all the
rivers try
Love can't be subdued
Every spark gets extinguished
Vasu,what happened.. please
tell me,what happened?
You naughty,rascal...
Hey,where are you running away?
- Do sit ups
Salutations to the
sweet sixteen
Salutations to the first sight
of love
Salutations to the first sight
of love,salutations
The first one in the world who
kindled love in this heart
Salutations to first sweet heart
of the world
Thanks to the paths shown
by love
Salutations to the path which
reaches the heart
The place where this maiden got
calumniated
Salutations to that Town,that Street
& that House
The one who united us &
separated us
Salutations to that Time,to that Moment
& to that Chime
We were meeting here
it is written here
Salutations to this Writings &
it's Punctuations
On the sands of shore,where the
heart quavered like this
Salutations to every Wave which
swelled in the sea
In the depths of the enchanting
lake of the eyes
Salutations to that Whirlpool
which drowned us
Defying the veil,the thing
that slipped away
Salutations to that Green wicked
upper cloth
The enemies of love tried
their best
Salutations to the Look which
wasn't deterred
When 2 of us meet
Both
When both of us will meet
Both
- Yes both
When both of us will meet
Yes,then
We'll make a new history
M- A-K-E
Create will be better
Isn't it?
Not only better,but
beautiful
C- R-E-A-T-E
And,if we don't meet,then...?
And,if we are not able to
meet,then...?
No... no...
And,if we are not able to meet,then
.. yeah-Yes
If we are not able to meet,then
- Yes,further
Even then,we'll create a
new history
Wonderful! Even then we'll
create a new history
Listen Postman
The letter which you gave that
house,where did it come from?
I don't know
- Is it from Hyderabad?
I told you,I don't know
What kind of a Postman is he?
he does not know anything
Daughter,in the morning,you
were asking the Postman -
Yes,this is Vasu's letter only!
he is alright
Job is also good,and
in Hyderabad...
Enough... Enough...
It's in Hindi,see
- I don't want to see anything
I know that you'll only
talk about Vasu-
And put the blame on me
I've broken the agreement
I beg of you! I don't want to
know about Vasu
Nor about Hyderabad
nor about his job
For God sake,in future
don't meet me
Don't see me & don't
talk to me also
Hello,Mr. Hari,are you fine?
Come.. come the devotee of
Lord Hanuman!
How are you?
Nothing new about me!
Neither wife nor that and
nor concubine
How is my son?
How is Sapna?
Did you see Mr. Hari,he's
asking straight away
How is Sapna?
He didn't even ask
how is mother?
Okay,how is mother?
- Enough!
Now tell me,how is Sapna?
She is like a Pumpkin
Mr. Hari,did you see his
mentality?
I don't want anything
but I wish that-
He should forget Sapna completely
One girl is staying in
this city
She's from our Madras
Caste and Race
matches perfectly
I want that some how Vasu should
get married to her
Mr. Shivaram,caste and Race
are now outdated
This is modern time
First love and later on
marriage
But...
We'll play a game
- What?
In this Love story,we'll
change the girl
How come?...
I'll appoint that girl as a typist
in my office
Then? -Then what?
Their eyes will meet and
they'll fall in love
Then...?- Love marriage
Then?... but how is it possible?
What is the guarantee?
What guarantee? I've seen
many such cases...
It's a small matter
Is it a small matter?- Yes
What's the name of the girl?
Tulasi
What's your age?-
Equal to Actress Hellen?
Zeenataman?.. Teenamuneem?
Who are they?
Oh! My god!don't you
watch Hindi movies?
I watch only Tamil films
Only Tamil movies?
Have you seen a Tamil movie
"Kadhalika Neramilai"
So,you've seen
What's the meaning of
that title?
There is no time to love
Here,you'll get lot of time!
Oh! No.. Aunty,what are
you burning?
Come.. come,your father laid a bet
that this photo can't be burnt
I'm proving that it can
be burnt
But,Mr. Professor,when did you
indulge in the dirty bet
Stop blabbering!
Atlast,I've won the bet
Sir,your Tea
Now,who has won?
Oh! you are here?
Swimming Pool which is filled
with water-
Is pleasant to look at
Isn't it?- Yes
I wanted to ask you
Something
Do you know,how to dance?
Before,I used to dance
but not now
Why?
Everything has got over
with him
But,why did you ask?
I thought you can teach
me dance-Yes?
Why?Am I not fit for it?
Yes! why not?
But,why do you want to
learn this?
I want to tire myself so much
by this practice
So,that the storm inside me
may mitigate
Oh! you want to meditate
- No,I want to forget
Will you teach me?
Why not?but it will be
very experience
Fees for Teacher
- We'll talk about it later
Then,what now?
First,you've to touch
Teacher's feet
Bless me!
When we both come together
When we both come together
we'll create a new History
Even,if we both don't
come together
Even,if we both don't come together
we'll create a new history,even then
How many people had loved
in this world?
Don't know how many,lover's blood
had this world sucked?
Why doesn't the thirsty sword stop?
why doesn't it's thirst gets subside?
We'll subside this world's
thirst!
We'll create a New History!
My heart is agitated
all night!
When the heartless world
tells us...
How many names are there in the books
who had been restricted to meet?
Why should we enter our names
in that list?
We'll create a new History!
Cholera in Hyderabad!
Let him die with cholera
and die a Dog's death
"Are you fine"?
Whenever you meet me,you'll always
ask me,"Are you fine"?
What does it mean?
Means... are you fine?
Her highness!
Why're you sitting alone here?
Sir,will you do a favour
to me?
Order me!
I've written Vasu's name all over
my room's wall,Isn't it?
Yes... Yes!
Can you count them and tell me
how many Vasu's are there?
Immediately!
I'm fine!
I'm fine!
Where did I leave it?
Surprise,Seethuram
When ever I want to send you
on an inspection
It'll always be invariably your
mother's death Anniversary
I want to ask you,how many
mother's do you've?
Why have you become a deaf like
Sanjeev Kumar of film'Koshish'?
Come on tell!
Last time it wasn't my mother's,it was
my grandma's Death Anniversary
Grandma's Death Anniversary?
Whose will it be next time?
your's?... Mine?... Whose?
Come on tell
I had arranged everything for
your Mangalore trip
Whom shall I send at
this last minute?
Did you see the film?
Sir,if you permit,shall
I go?
What do you know about
this work?
I'll leave,Sir!
Alright! do you want to
help Seethuram?
No sir,it'll be a great help
for myself
Someone has to go there
you can go!
Who's car is that one
with stickers?
Oh! that Hazel,H belongs
to Chakravarthi
He has come from Goa,he had
enquired about students group
.. And took up a room in
this Hotel only
Have you come here to
spy on me?
You don't get angry my highness
it was Aunty's order to watch over you
She doesn't have any faith
on you,Isn't it?
When she doesn't have faith on me
why didn't she stop me there itself?
Does she consider,am I so shameless
to elope with anyone at midnight?
No.. No..! No.. No!
I've not come alone,I've come with
So many girl students,Teachers
have come with me
What'll they think about me,if
they see you spying me?
You don't worry,my highness! neither
I'll chase you nor I'll watch you
It was aunty's order
that I had to...
After all,she's my
mother-in-law
Mother-in-law?
If the agreement breaks down...
If her highness permits me
shall I go for a bath?
What is this strange,bond that
we share between us?
It's neither known to me
nor known to you
One string pulls and the second
comes running!
It'll come tied by the pull
of brittle strings
Like... like a mad lover!
It's neither known to me
nor known to you
Neither I'm getting sleep
nor peace
Even after a Herculian effort
I'm unable to stop it
...You are coming into
my dreams
It's neither known to me
nor known to you
Where did she go away?
Are you a Tourist guide?
Where's Sapna?
She has gone out
Who are you?
Me?... I'm her husband
Husband?
Almost!
I mean would-be husband
I thought,before I get married,I
shall get trained in family life
Sapna has gone with her would-be
husband in car
Both would enjoy their
journey back
Let them enjoy,both are going
to be husband & wife
Let them do anything,how're
we concerned with it?
Who are you?
When did you come back
from Mangalore?
What happened to you?
...Say something
...Let it play on
You're dancing like a
typhoon?
What happened to you?
I don't want to get drowned in
tears,that's why!
I was in such a deep
trance of sleep
...That even,if my eye was pierced
by thorn,I wouldn't have realised it
But now,I've come out of
the trance
And the truth has come infront of me
in it's true disposing form
You always tried to hide
a pain from me
Even when it tried to come out
you always stopped it in throat
Can't you share your pain
with me?
This is not pain..
it's poison
Neither can I swallow it
nor spit it out
In front,till my vision sees
I find only sea of darkness
Sandhya,I feel,I may get
drowned in it
I need a companion
I never saw you in such
a condition
Your eyes are burning like
Embers
Not just eyes,my entire body
is burning
My soul is also burning
I need such a cool shadow... under which
I can forget all my memories
All my memories
Why can't you be that
shadow?
I'm Siramakrishnan speaking
how are you?
Is my son there?
No,it's 6 P.M now,everyone has left
the office,I'm alone in the office
I've some personal work
How's Thulasi,have they started
meeting or not?
You're talking about meeting,she
has stuck,such that
If sensor people see it,they'll
cut them for obscene
Very good.. very good
how are you?
What could be sensational for me?neither
wife nor concubine or any woman
Do you love him?
Do you want to marry him?
Come on tell
If you permit me
by saying Yes to it
How eagerly I was waiting
to hear this Yes from you?
If you settle again in life
with this marriage
There Isn't any happiness which
is bigger than this for me
Sandhya,come whatever may,your
marriage will take place
...Definitely it'll...
You?... In Hyderabad?
I've a book stall in this
Exhibition
Do you want to know
who is she?
She's my future wife
Go and tell in Goa,that
I too can marry
Time?... Yes
I met him in Hyderabad
And he introduced me to his
future wife also
She's from Hyderabad
What a great beauty?!what a
youthfulness? what an eyes?
What great style,what great lips
what great colours?
Oh! Sapna! Is it you?...
come.. come..
How are you,my child?
I've come to ask you about
an important matter?
First time,you've come to our house
just wait for a minute
Child,have this sweet
Is it for Vasu's
Engagement?
What did you say?
Vasu is marrying some one else
Isn't it?
Who said that?
Come on tell
Is it true or not?
This can't be true
Without intimating us,how
can Vasu marry?
Then what I had heard
just now?
It's a lie
That's not a lie! you're lying
...For your son's love
You've gone mad in love
Did you understand my son
only this much?
Vasu will renege his promise
No.. no.. I've known Vasu since his
birth,are you teaching me about him?
Yuck! go away,you mad girl
You seem to be a man of
great conduct
I didn't know that you too have the
habit of keeping false promises
An experienced woman could
manage very well
Are you marrying that widow
with these ideas?
I don't know,what do you men
see in a woman?
That you're ready to die
immediately
Is there any custom & tradition
for it or not?
A big house... large eyes.. If one has
large front & back enough
...Is it enough?
But,Baby! I've not seen anything
big in you
Except,your big dirty mouth
Did Vasu give you an
invitation or not?
Unable to understand... what's that
big in you?
Which Vasu likes in you!
Except that big vermillion
You're Sapna,Isn't it?
- Yes and you
I've something to discuss
with you
It's time for my college
mother is inside,you may meet her
My name is Sandhya!- Is it
- I've come from Hyderabad
I'm Vaus's friend
Come in
What about your college?
Today,it's leave
Come Vasu,do something helpful
for your marriage arrangements?
Write atleast addresses
on these cards?
Isn't Sandhya there?
She has gone out of station
To personally invite her friends
for the marriage
Can't they be invited by post?
It's a normal practice now!
Come in!
Please sit down!
Who wrote all this?
It's me!
It was mother's order not to
utter even Vasu's name
For that order...
...This was my reply!
Mother is the biggest hurdle
in our love
Yes!
Vasu told me everything
Did Vasu tell you everything?
If he hadn't told me
how could I know all this?
Whenever we meet,it's always
about you,we discuss
Are you both so close?
Yes!
So,close... that you both touch
each other also?
Whenever we meet
we shake hands!
How is my Vasu?
This is 30th time,you're
asking this!
Don't count!I'll ask
millions of times
How's Vasu?
Our agreement will not break,Isn't it
If I ask like that?
Poor man!he Isn't a bad man
but he's a simpleton
He has come from Lucknow with a
fond hope that I'll marry him
If the agreement fails
This agreement will never fail
Look at her!
...Hey!...
Is she Vasu's mother?
No!
My mother-in-law!
Sapna,I'm going back by
tonight's flight
So early?
The work for which I'm here
is over
What work?
Do you want me to tell
the truth?
Definitely!
I had come to decide about
my marriage
What did you decide?
Oh! this is Coffee!I had
ordered for Tea
May be my cup of coffee
has come to you
...I didn't defile your
cup of Coffee
When did you come back?
This morning!
You didn't even inform me
before going!
Got the Ticket?have you sent it?
alright
Do you want to go to
office early?
No!
But,why did you call me
so urgently?
Madam,a flight Ticket,that travel agent
brought & gave it
Alright!
Abdullah! what's the date
today?
And year?
Madam?- Come on tell
Isn't it 18th December 1979!?!
Now,you can go,look here
What are they?
They're marriage Invitations
I'm going to post them
Not necessary!- Go!
I'm unable to understand anything
Your silence is making
me go mad
We are made for each other
Understood!
Oh alright! then,you went to
go to Goa,Isn't it?
Alright! did you meet Sapna?
Yes,I did meet her!
Oh! that's why,this new behaviour
this new style
What did Sapna tell you?
Sapna told me everything!
About your love...
About those places...
.. Where you both used to roam around
with hands on each other's shoulders
She told about those
day's matters
.. Which used to come after
a long time of interval
.. But used to get over
very quickly
And about your long
live agreement
...It's big clauses!
Sapna has told me
everything
Is it so?
Didn't she tell about
her marriage?
Before the agreement could end
she's marrying a rich Bastard
If I had the rights,which I
had on you till yesterday
I would've slapped you for
uttering such dirty words
You met same Tom,Dick & Harry
did you believe whatever said by him?
The man you met in Manglore...
He likes Sapana.
But,Sapana doesn't like him.
There is a big difference
like earth & sky!
The difference between
Sapna and you
Sapna Isn't weak minded
like you.
She never forgot you even
for a moment.
She's counting every day,every
minute,waiting for you.
You just tell me only
this much!
When is your agreement
going to elapse?
When are you both going
to meet again?
Come on tell!
That means... tomorrow?
Waiting for this day,her eyes
have developed wounds!
How easily you could
forget her?
And were about to marry me?
It seems you had once jumped into the
river on a request from Sapna!
Is it to leave her in the
middle of the stream?
You know that!
When I get angry,I lose
my senses
This is my weakness
But neither such thing ever
occurred in my life!
Nor my anger has ever
let me down
Whatever I heard in Manglore
on that day!
It didn't even have proper means
to clarify it with Sapna
What was the necessity
to clarify?
Couldn't you wait till the
lapsing of the agreement?
Is that all your care?
If your heart get's shaken so
much for trivial matters...
Neither you've any right to
love nor be loved
Now,you only tell me,what
am I do?
You want me to tell you
even that
Take this Ticket to Goa
you leave immediately
After so much has happened
...Thank God
Before that could happen,this
had happened
That's why,I stopped posting of
wedding Invitations also
Me?.. I'll remain myself
My loneliness
...They were with me
earlier also
Now also,they'll be with
me only
Nobody will lose anything
If true love wins
What more can I ask?
But,leaving a Goddess
like you...
Will Sapna forgive me
for this?
Only if Sapna had known
all this?
Didn't you tell anything
to Sapna?
You've become so great,that I can't
look into your eyes & talk
Alright!where's sir?
No need to talk with my
brother regarding me
But,Sandhya,how can I
... No..
My marriage will not take place
with you,I'm saying it myself
Go,Vasu,it's your time
for your flight
Remember it
If you don't go today,you'll never be
able to meet Sapna again
Sapna will remain a
distant dream for you
Go!
I don't know,why,but,I feel even now
I may not be able to meet Sapna
Just tell me only this much,what
did she say before you came back?
Before I came!
First,she kissed me here
...That was for me
Then,here...
...That was for you
What happened to the Red vermellion
on your head?
Fate cried so much,that it got
washed away in it's tears
Then,whatever I had heard
was true?
He has gone away!and you
didn't even tell me
Even if,I told you,could you've
changed my fate's path?
Brother!
Today,once again,it has been proved that
family life,Isn't written in my fate
Yes... yes,he has cheated and
escaped from here
He's reaching Panjim by
morning flight
I've heard,that he's coming
there to meet some girl
Come whatever may,don't allow
them to meet
Break his hands...
break his legs
If possible,do away with
his life also
Mr. Belli
Every drop of whisky,that's flowing
in my veins
They're always loyal to you
Can I ever forget your favours?
Cheating my sister here,and enjoying
with some other girl there
Understood?
Take it,as your job is done
Today,you got up very early?
I'm waiting for the Sun
Why?
Is it Solar Eclipse today?
It was Eclipsed all the
And I couldn't forget
even a day
It was a year long of
one dark night
But,today the Eclipse
has got over
Today's Sun will come
with my life
...With my Vasu
Even I too wish,that your
Vasu must return
But,God's record is there
till now
He has always been ruthless
with True lovers
That's why!I'm still with
a hope
No... NO...
...My number will always be
second
First is he...
Look,Sun has come
Your Vasu will also
definitely come
I whole heartedly wish,that you both
should live happily forever
Has the marriage date
been changed?
Who told you?
Senior Boss,was saying...
With whom?
He was talking on phone with
Goa's Ram Singh
He was very angry
... and also over drunk
I came to know this also...
he was ordering to kill Vasu
No Sandhya!I'm not so heartless
to take anyone's life
Last night,in that inebriated mood
don't know,what I told him
Could I tell him to take
Vasu's life?
You're a drunkard
In your drinking binge,you'll not
know what you're doing...
And what you're blabbering?
Don't know,which beast wakes
up in you at that time?
And the man in you sleeps
What's Goa's Ram Sing's
phone number?
He has left home early
morning itself
It seems,he has left home...
Tell me,what are we
supposed to do now?
Look,we've to talk with him
regarding a very important matter
Is there any way that I can get
in touch with him?
Or could you send him
a message?
Do you know anything about
his whereabouts?
All I know is,once he
leaves home...
Even Police can't search
& find him
Can you give your neighbour
Mr. Sivaram's phone number?
How can they've phone
at home?
You may've at least his office
phone number?
I don't know
This really is a bad thing
Vasu has left for home
from here
But... but...
His life is in danger
Oh!God!
Yes!
I've understood
No need to plead so much!
This is my duty,I'll personally
go & inform them
You don't worry
Who's Telephone was it?
Stop... stop... stop...

Take this.
- Sir, I don't have change.
Keep it with you
Vasu has come
Vasu has come
Hey!Mr. Sivaram!your son is coming

...Why don't you keep quiet
for sometime?

so thin in one year?
Greetings!

First,I'll greet you by
folding my both hands
Then,I'll ask,how's your
health keeping now a days?
Please sit,sir!
Wow!Great son!you've started
speaking chaste Hindi
Where's father?
He has gone inside
How did you come to
know about it?
May be,he's feeling embarassed
to show his face to me
Leave it!I'll be back
in a minute
Alright!... alright!
Vasu,where's he?
Are you both father & son
playing hide & seek?
No,I thought of giving him sweets
as soon as he comes in
Greetings mother-in-law
how are you?
Why're you looking at me like
that?I'm Vasu
The barrier of time which you
had built,its over now
I've come to marry your
daughter
But,I don't find any receiptions
for your son-in-law
Isn't there any grand welcome
for me?
I seek your blessings
Mr. Professor
How's your health?
Let my health go to hell
First,tell me,how could you learn
such good Hindi?
Firing like a stengun
It was Mother-in-law's wish, isn't it?
That I must learn Hindi
Come on tell me,which region's
Hindi shall I talk?
Delhi's slang?
Meerut-Moradabadi slang?
Mathura-Brindavan's Brij slang?
Ayodhya's Awadhi?Bihar's Bhojpuri?
or Punjab's Punjabi
Oh!My handsome,my butter sweet
How are you?
Say something!Oh!uncle
open your mouth
Uncle,Isn't it Punjabi?
Mister!why're you staring
at me like this?
Go inside and inform the bride
that Groom has arrived outside...
...To marry her
Great 1000/0 Urdu
Get up,Mother-in-law,get up
A heart is beneath your leg!
It'll be a kind consideration
This is Lucknow Urdu
Greetings... greetings!
Hey!fool!what are you
hearing?
Won't you go inside and
call my Bride?
Oh!My God!even we too don't
know such a slang
Which region's language?
Avadh!
Still,you're standing here
come,go away from here
...Bombay's local slang
Mother-in-law!you've become
so thin
Is it yearning for me?
Wood will burn and become
Charcoal
Charcoal will burn and
become ash
I got so much burnt that neither
there was charcoal nor Ash
Professor!Is it enough,or do you
want anymore Hindi?
Enough of Hindi!Truely
enough of Hindi
Firing like a stengun
Professor,tell me only this
why Isn't Sapna seen till now?
Is she getting dressed
up inside?
But,you must agree
one thing,sir
You're the best choice
for Sapna
But,where's Sapna!
Don't you know?
- No
I know!
Ask me!- Where?
Isn't there your Love spot?
... near the Sea shore
There's a mount near
the shore
There's a temple on the
top of the mount
And inside the Temple...
After so many days,I've got
a chance
God promise!I can't leave it
No... No...
No... leave me... leave me...
Leave me!
No!
No!
Police?... Run... Run...
What happened to you,Vasu?
... You're in such a bad shape...
This is price of our Love
and our meeting
I feel,that the entire world
has become our enemy
What happened to you,Sapna?
.. My Love,My body...
My chastity...
Considering all three
as your property...
...How safely I had gaurded
it for you?
But,you've come at such a time
when,I'm about to die...
I'm also holding the last few
breaths only for you
...Just to meet you
Come on tell me,what happened?
Yes... yes!
My entire pain,all my tears
that's inside my eyes
Some how, I wished, it
reaches you
You're disappearing from
my eyes
No!
My eyes are getting closed.
I'm dying!...
No... Vasu... No!
Don't leave me and go away!
Did we both separate from each other to
meet like this in the embrace of death?
Before death engulfs me
somehow take me away with you
Take me away with you
Come Sapna!
Love's Language is different
One who loses in it...
...They say he has won!
And one who wins in it...
they say he has lost
Those who win in this,marry
And those who lose,give their
lives for one another
And become Immortal!
