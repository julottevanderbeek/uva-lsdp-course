In days of old
when knights were bold
And nightshirts
held their sway
A jolly minstrel
strummed his uke
My worldly goods
are a sleepy old mule
A song and a busted guitar
Ha-ha!
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
A toast we'll sing
unto our king
To his good health
we'll sing
A toast we'll sing
unto our king
Of my kingdom
of Kalapazoo
Upon this day
my daughter weds
The prince
of Poopoopadoo
Behold the prince!
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh,
uh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-huh!
Behold the princess!
At my command
you'll give thy hand
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh,
uh-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-huh!
I know you'll learn
to love me.
Never! Never!
Never!
She acts like a fanatic!
Lock her in the attic!
Cheer up,
o lovely princess
I'll take thee away
so ye won't have to stay
Ha-ha!
Hello!
Shh!
- I'll save thee, Princess.
- How?
- Hath thou a rope?
- Nay, nay. No rope.
What? No rope?
Bring on the wedding feast!
What ho!
Guards! Guards!
Wretch! Scoundrel!
One, two--
Stop!
I love him, Father!
Spare his head!
Clear the hall!
We'll have a duel!
The prince shall battle
this young fool!
Hooray!
Hooray!
We're gonna have a duel
We're gonna have a duel
We're gonna have a duel
We're gonna have a duel
We're gonna have a duel
We're gonna have a duel
We're gonna have a duel
We're gonna have a duel
We're gonna have a duel
We're gonna have a duel
We're gonna have a duel
We're gonna have a duel
In days of old
when knights were bold
All hail
the royal bride and groom
