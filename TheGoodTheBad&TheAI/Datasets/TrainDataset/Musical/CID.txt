Hello, listen, it's me.
The boss says he had
better come around.
He better be kept silent.
If he won't be paid off...
...then use
another method, get it?
It's me.
Get him out of the way!
If need be, pay him. Or else,
have him removed. All right?
Take this to printing room.
Who's calling?
Remember the man who has
been very good to you?
I've made my
decision very clear.
We must know if you'll
see our point of view.
My newspaper
always prints the truth.
Is that your last word?
Yes! Neither money nor threat
will make me change my mind.
Inspector Shekhar, please.
A call from Bombay Times office.
I'm coming. Here...
Constable, I've been here
all day. My feet are aching.
Please be patient.
- How can I be?
Sir, I've been robbed.
What is it?
- Sir, he's gone.
Who are you talking about?
- He's vanished again.
Can you tell me his name?
- Oh Lord! What can I say?
How can I tell you his name?
It's like a ball that sinks.
- You mean the moon?
No, not the moon. It sparkles.
- Star? You mean. Tarachand?
Ramsingh, look after the case!
I've told you a thousand
times go to the police station.
I've been there so often, that
I'm exhausted. I won't go again.
I'll tell the superintendent,
the commissioner.
I'll lodge a complaint, I'll
write to the home minister.
You call me every day, you cross
examine me.
Look into my eyes. Do
I look like a thief?
We'll have to find out.
Mr. Srivastav, what made
you think of me today?
I needed help so
I thought of you.
Police help? How can we...?
Someone is
threatening to kill me.
Who is it? - Someone.
It'd help if you came over.
What's new, Inspector?
Any murder, any robbery?
Mr. Banerjee. This is the
C.I.D. Office not a news agency.
I know. You realize that as a
reporter, I must make public...
Don't bother me!
Give this for typesetting.
What is it?
Who are you? What do you want?
Who was he?
Phone the hospital! The police!
Where's the fellow who
was standing near the lift?
There's been a murder at
the Bombay Times office...
Follow that car!
- Why? Who are you?
I'm a C.I. D officer.
We've got to follow that car.
I don't need to.
Then I will.
Stop the car. I
said, stop the car!
Can you see it?
What do I care?
There's a killer escaping. Let
me get him. I'll return the car...
...with thanks.
Before you arrest him,
I'll have you arrested.
I've told you, I'm
a C.I. D officer.
You look more like murderer.
Is that car following us?
- It looks like it.
Drive faster!
You won't catch up with them.
Don't worry. I'll
overtake them as soon as I can.
If you're a gentleman,
you'll get me home at once.
I assure you. I'll take
you home, safe and around.
Are we to follow them all night?
I won't stop
until I've got them.
Drive faster!
Look, the car stopped.
They've pulled over.
Check the license plate!
What is it? Give me the key.
The key!
Do you realize that murderer
has got away because of you?
If you want to get home,
you'll have to search for the keys.
In this rain?
If you don't want to
get wet, then sit here.
I can't find them.
I'm off. I'll go
and look for help.
Wait!
I'll be all alone.
Aren't you afraid of me?
All right. Sit in the back.
We'll look for the keys later.
Are you cold?
Why not guess my name? I
live by the bank of the river.
In my yard, swaying fig tree
spreads its cool shadow over me.
People call me crazy, as
my hair flies the breeze.
A black mole enhances my beauty.
My face is as fair as could be.
On the winding streets I
wander, young men stare in stupor.
Be careful today,
when you look my way.
As you gaze at my hair,
you'll be caught in a snare.
Whenever I walk,
I gather hearts.
Those who have heart to
lose, I am a women of ill repute.
I am a mystery, that is my
fame, but why not guess my name?
It's time to go. Will you
ask me where I'll travel?
What is it?
- Police.
Where were you at that time? -
I was at the press. He sent me.
He sent you there?
Who else was there?
- I believe...
Who else was there?
No one. The editor was alone.
The morning shift had left.
The night shift hadn't come.
Was the phone in this position?
Any fingerprints?
- I'm checking.
He may not survive.
Made any arrests?
- We're holding someone.
Weren't you following a lead?
Any conclusions?
Who are you?
- The sub editor.
Did the editor smoke?
- No, nor did he eat paan.
Your name?
- Master.
Occupation?
- I'm a cutter- tailor.
I cut coats and trousers.
If I need money, I'm
known to cut pockets, too.
Why were you at the office?
My stomach and brain are empty.
With some tea, my
brain will start working.
Shut up! I'll set
your brain right.
Why were you there?
- To place an advertisement.
An advertisement? What for?
- For a bride.
For whom?
Don't you understand?
- Be quiet!
A bride for me.
- You fool!
Whose marriage?
- Who is she?
She was my wife to be.
I mean, she is my wife to be.
Then why place an advertisement?
The advertisement
was to look for work.
To her it's work, and
to me it's marriage?
She's the one I'll
marry. I'll work anywhere.
You talk to me of
marriage, and to her of work.
What do you mean?
Aren't you ashamed?
You told me you'll marry
me. Who is this other girl?
Do you both want to
be put in the lock-up?
Sorry, Inspector.
This man is insane.
This isn't your home.
Now, what do you want?
To stand bail.
- Impossible!
It's a murder charge
- Murder?
Constable, take her away.
I'm glad you've come.
- What are you doing here?
He was found at the
scene of the crime.
You know me very well.
Help me. He doesn't know me.
Why were you at the
Bombay Times office?
Someone did his job before I...
What nonsense?
I haven't done
anything. I'm innocent.
I've spent all my life
cutting clothes, never throats.
Did you see who did it?
- Of course!
I saw him go in
and come out again.
He had eyes as big as a 100
watt bulb. Built like a wrestler.
I was trembling with fear.
Can you identify him? - I
Can identify his entire clan.
You can leave
- Really?
Stop pickpocketing or
you'll be in for life.
He's a mere pickpocket.
I know him very well.
But keep an eye on him.
O gentle heart... life
is an uphill struggle...
Be alert, be street wise.
This is my Bombay, my friend.
There are buildings and
trams, and motorcars and mills.
There is everything to be
had, except a heart's thrills.
There's not a trace of
humanity in this bustling city.
Some play numbers, some
go to races, others thieve.
Some starve, some suffer
insults, others grieve.
Yet the idle manage to
make both ends meet.
Here, vagabond is
another name for homeless.
While others cut throats
and that's called business.
It may be the same game, but
it goes under many a name.
You called the world unfair,
don't be so naive, beware.
You will reap what you sow
that's the name of the game.
Flexing your muscles
won't make old Bombay tame.
Any news?
You're right. Sir, there is
hashish mixed in this tobacco.
Get me the file on the
criminals who deal in narcotics.
Did you find anything out?
- No, nothing.
I'm hoping when
Srivastav regains consciousness...
I am sorry, Shekhar...
...the hospital phoned
that Shrivastav is dead.
Why would anyone want to
kill such a noble man?
Bad news.
I'm sure there are at
least two people involved.
One who committed the crime,
the other who engineered it.
Is this a doubt, or...?
- Here. Have a look.
Srivastav sent this article
just before he was attacked.
He was about to
expose someone important...
...but he was killed before
he could accomplish that.
Have you found any clues?
- A cigarette.
here, at least million smoke.
Those who smoke hashish can
be counted among thousands.
Here's our man.
Bring him to me!
Ibrahim, let's have another
- All right, then.
How are things
with you, Shersingh?
Who's he?
- A friend.
Here...
- A cigarette?
I don't like his face.
Your name?
Editor Srivastav.
Who picked my pocket?
Lost much?
- 8 annas.
Take the packet. Pay me later.
A packet of Peela
Haathi and a paan.
Posing as a millionaire
without a penny!
That's the trouble. You
think I'm good for nothing.
So you picked his pocket?
Here's 8 annas. Fill the
paan with my unrequited love.
It's a counterfeit.
- Counterfeit?
Poison disguised as
nectar! What's going on?
To the police station!
Why?
- You'll see.
Here's 8 annas, tell me now.
Join the police. You
visit them each day.
There'll be no need to
have a police force.
If there are no thieves,
there won't be any thefts.
You'll go hungry.
Why are you taking
me? I'm innocent.
Then why? It's not on
a murder charge, is it?
Inspector Shekhar
knows it. I didn't do it.
He'll be there. You tell him.
My love, caress my
neck for the last time...
...it's heading
straight for the noose.
You've been called to
identify the killer.
You've got him? Let's go.
Wait! Is he securely bound?
I'm not scared. But I don't
get on well with cutthroats.
Well? Will you be able
to identify the murder?
At once!
- Scared?
Scared? Me? I
have a lion's heart.
Who is the man you saw at
the Bombay Times office?
Identify him!
If looks could kill, I'd be...
Don't worry. We're with
you. Tell us who he is.
Point him out. Which one?
- That one.
Speak up!
Black coat!
It wasn't me. He's
lying. I'll fix you.
Take him away! You may leave.
Skekhar, wake up!
Enchanted my first love,
eyes filled with sweet dreams.
From the realm of
magic, appeared a magician.
A cloud of fine hair
blows over your face.
Don't walk away,
turn around and stay.
He stands at your door,
eyes filled with sweet dreams.
Your eyes may
flash with anger now...
...but cupid's bow
will smooth your brow.
You'll soon surrender
under the magician's spell.
Hearing you talk, she
begins to break into smile.
See how the laughter
gathers at her lips.
Despite herself, her face
reveals her love, anger veils.
From the realm of
magic, appeared a magician.
If you value your life, go away.
Take another step,
and you go to jail.
This is the S.P.'s home.
- I know. I'm here to see him.
The call of death
is irresistible.
Come in. I'll take care of you.
After you.
You're so impolite.
Making yourself at home, eh?
May I have a glass of water?
You'll even get
lemonade. Let father come.
Yes, my father.
- Your...?
Father, see...
- What is it?
That man's here again.
- What man?
The man who took my car.
- Where is he?
He is sitting there.
First, it was the car.
Now, he's followed me in.
Do you mean him?
- Yes.
My daughter Rekha.
- Delighted to meet you.
Rekha has a bone
to pick with you.
I needed a car to follow a
suspect. I had no choice.
Excuse me, please.
Instead of lemonade,
may I have some water?
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
The mistake was fortunate or
else how would we have met?
Since when did you know him?
What did you have against
him? Why did you kill him?
Silence won't save
you from hanging.
At 8.07, you entered
the Bombay Times office...
...at 8.10 Srivastav was killed.
At 8.12 you left the office,
at 8.14 I saw near the lift.
Fool! Death is as close to
you as this chair before you.
A call for you, sir.
Srivastav didn't hurt a
fly. He was a noble man...
...and you killed
him. You'll pay.
Sooner or later, you'll tell us
why you killed him, understood?
Who is it?
- We've never met.
Your name?
- I can't tell you.
Can I be of help?
- Actually, I can help you.
Help me?
- Yes.
I have some information
about Srivastav's murder...
...which will most
probably fascinate you.
Come over then.
- I can't
You'll have to come to see me.
- Where are you?
You must come here.
- But how?
My car is parked in
front of your office.
License plate BMZ 1454.
Get into the car. My
driver will bring you.
Are you here for me?
- Yes. Sit down.
So you prefer tinted glass?
Don't you find it too dark?
- I'm used to it.
Some cool breeze preferably?
- I'm not used to it.
Don't you find it stuffy?
It's dangerous for us
to be seen together.
Where are we going?
- You'll see.
Do sit down.
What can you tell me
about the murder case?
Case? What case?
You told me you could shed
some light on the matter.
Shed light? I don't like light.
Why call me here?
I hear you like parrots.
Parrots?
- Yes parrots.
I suppose I do. What about you?
Only one kind... a mute one.
They're worthless.
They won't fetch 4 annas.
Name your price. I'll pay well.
A thousand, two
thousand, five thousand.
You own such a parrot.
- No.
The one I own is a chatterbox.
A new parrot entered
your cave recently.
You've tried hard
to make him talk...
So far he hasn't.
That one?
- Yes.
So you understand me now.
I'll pay any price you
want. 10,000, 20,000, 50,000.
Is it a deal?
- Find yourself another parrot.
I won't sell.
Bribing is an offence.
A bribe? I'm not bribing anyone.
If you won't sell, then don't.
Why get angry?
- I'll have you arrested.
Go ahead, Inspector.
He refuses to sell.
How high did you bid?
What was your offer, 50,000?
He refused.
- He's left?
He's here, unconscious.
Good. Have him dumped.
- Where?
On The Bombay Agra road.
He mustn't know
where he was. Be careful!
Rekha! It's you?
How did I get here?
- You were brought here.
You were lying unconscious
on the Bombay Agra road.
What's happening?
Your friends are waiting.
Do you feel better?
- Much better, sir.
I'm sorry to bother,
coming here in this state.
Regard this as your
home. But what happened?
I was following a lead
on the Srivastav case.
I was offered a drink and then...
It can wait. We'll talk later.
It's Rekha's birthday.
Freshen up and come down.
Happy birthday!
Where were you?
- I am here now. Some cake?
You won't get it.
Here, have it.
- No, thanks.
Why? You will have to.
I fast on Tuesdays.
- It is only fruit, Dharamdasji.
I don't touch fruit, either.
- Such principles!
You are opening a hospital?
- It's my duty to serve.
You are a benevolent man.
Meet Mr. Dharamdas, a well
- known citizen of Bombay.
Pleased to meet you.
He helps everyone.
Just today, he donated Rs.
Don't embarrass me, Mr. Mathur.
Have you made any
progress on Srivastav's case?
It's his case, ask him.
- Well...
I haven't seen you for ages
- It's been four years.
Four years! They've
flown by like four days.
You're lucky to think of
four years as four days.
I have so much to
talk to you about.
I must leave.
- Already?
Come along, Kamini.
- No, I must leave.
Srivastav's case...?
- Nothing so far.
Excuse me.
Where have you been?
You look pale.
- Trouble with income tax?
Kamini, meet Inspector Shekhar.
Pleased to meet you.
- For the second time.
The second time?
- Yes.
Then, you were after a parrot.
A parrot?
- You offered 50,000.
I'm serious.
What's wrong with you?
Come on, let's go.
She's the same girl.
- She's a close friend.
I'm leaving, Rekha.
- Why the hurry?
It's quite late. Bye!
What are you doing here?
- Rekha asked me over.
How long have you known her?
- We are childhood friends.
We've no friends here.
They're all police officers.
They can send you to your death.
Did Shekhar
realize who you were?
I fooled him...
...but I think he
suspects something.
Leave the city before his
suspicions are confirmed.
Keep clear of the C.I.D.
You're leaving?
- Yes I have some work.
We'll meet again?
- Yes.
Where are you going?
I have some urgent work.
- I know.
You'll follow her though.
I've told you she's a friend.
Don't follow her.
- I won't. I have work.
Do you, really?
I don't care.
If you leave now, I'll
never talk to you again.
