DATE--SEPTEMBER 6, 1620.
JUST 128 YEARS
SINCE COLUMBUS
DISCOVERED AMERICA.
THE PLACE--
THE HARBOR OF PLYMOUTH
IN ENGLAND.
A TINY SHIP CALLED
THEMAYFLOWER
IS BEING BOARDED
BY 102 PEOPLE.
THERE ARE 70 MEN AND WOMEN,
A HANDFUL OF COCKS
AND HENS AND PETS,
AND A DOG.
SOME OF THE VOYAGERS
ARE PEOPLE
WHO TODAY
WE CALL PILGRIMS.
THEY'RE LEAVING THEIR HOMELAND
TO SEEK MORE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM
IN THE NEW WORLD.
SOME PASSENGERS,
KNOWN AS "STRANGERS,"
ARE MERELY SEEKING WEALTH
IN THE NEW LAND.
SOME ARE
INDENTURED SERVANTS,
AND THE REST
ARE THE CREW
WHO WILL SAIL
THE MAYFLOWER.
THE PILGRIMS
HAVE A CONTRACT
WITH ENGLISH MERCHANTS
WHO WILL FINANCE
THE JOURNEY.
THE PILGRIMS AND MERCHANTS
WILL SHARE ANY PROFITS
FROM THE NEW SETTLEMENT.
THIS, HOWEVER, IS A MOST
DANGEROUS UNDERTAKING.
THE VOYAGERS REALIZE
THEIR VERY LIVES
ARE AT RISK.
THEY MUST CROSS
THE TREACHEROUS
NORTH ATLANTIC
IN A VERY SMALL SHIP.
THE JOURNEY WILL TAKE
MANY WEEKS
ON THE OPEN SEA.
MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN
WILL BE TRAVELING
IN UNBELIEVABLY
CROWDED CONDITIONS,
SHARING WHAT LITTLE
SPACE THERE IS
WITH THE PRECIOUS CARGO.
THE VOYAGERS WILL
HARDLY HAVE ANY ROOM
TO SLEEP AND EAT,
LET ALONE MOVE ABOUT.
MANY WILL BE LEAVING
LOVED ONES BEHIND.
EVEN IF THEY SURVIVE
THIS DANGEROUS CROSSING,
THEY WILL ARRIVE AT
A VIRTUAL WILDERNESS.
HOWEVER,
THEIR BELIEF IN GOD,
THEIR DESIRE FOR FREEDOM
FROM RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION,
AND THEIR DREAMS
OF CREATING A NEW WORLD
FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS
ALL MAKE THEIR
LIFE-THREATENING JOURNEY
A RISK WORTH TAKING.
THEIR ADVENTURES
WILL CHANGE THE COURSE
OF AMERICAN HISTORY.
FOR THE FIRST WEEKS,
THERE ARE FAVORABLE WINDS.
THE MAYFLOWER
MAKES STEADY PROGRESS
ACROSS THE SEA.
UNFORTUNATELY,
EVEN IN GOOD WEATHER,
THE CONDITIONS ABOARD SHIP
ARE MISERABLE.
THERE ARE NO
SANITARY PROVISIONS
AND VERY LITTLE PRIVACY.
SOME HAVE TO SLEEP
ON STRAW ON THE FLOORS.
SOME ON BOARD
GET VIOLENTLY SEASICK.
THE CHILDREN,
RANGING IN AGE
FROM A FEW MONTHS OLD
TO 15, GROW RESTLESS.
AFTER THE FIRST FEW WEEKS
OF FAVORABLE WINDS,
THE NORTH ATLANTIC OCEAN
FINALLY TURNS ITS FULL FURY
ON THE TINY MAYFLOWER.
DAMAGING CROSSWINDS
AND VIOLENT STORMS
CONTINUE STRAINING
THE MAYFLOWER
TO THE BREAKING POINT.
THE PASSENGERS ARE FORCED
TO STAY INSIDE
IN THE FOUL-SMELLING
CABINS.
I'M NOT FEELING WELL,
LINUS.
I'M NOT EITHER,
CHARLIE BROWN.
HOW MUCH FARTHER
DO WE HAVE TO GO?
I'M NOT SURE.
I THINK SOMEONE SAID
WE'RE ABOUT HALFWAY.
OH, NO!
COME ON,
CHARLIE BROWN.
SHAPE UP.
YOU CAN'T LET
THIS LITTLE WIND
BOTHER YOU.
THE STORMS BECOME
SO VIOLENT,
THE CREW IS FORCED
TO HULL THE SHIP,
TO GO TO SHORT SAIL,
OR PRACTICALLY
NO SAIL AT ALL.
THIS KEEPS THE SAILS
FROM RIPPING APART,
BUT NOW THE MAYFLOWER
IS LIKE A CORK,
BOBBING UP AND DOWN,
HELPLESS
ON THE GREAT OCEAN.
AAH!
MAN OVERBOARD!
WHAT WAS ALL THE YELLING
ABOUT ON DECK?
THEY JUST SAVED
JOHN HOWLAND'S LIFE.
THE STORM
BLEW HIM OVERBOARD.
OH, NO!
AND NOW THERE'S
ANOTHER PROBLEM.
NOW WHAT?
WE MAY HAVE TO
RETURN TO ENGLAND.
TURN BACK?
ARE THEY CRAZY?
AFTER ALL
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH?
THE STORM DAMAGED
ONE OF THE MAIN BEAMS
AT MIDSHIPS.
THE BEAM IS CRACKED
AND BOWED.
WHY CAN'T THEY FIX IT?
WHY CAN'T WE JUST GO ON?
SOME OF THE CREW THINK
OUR SHIP HAS ALREADY
TAKEN TOO MUCH
OF A BEATING.
IF WE HEAD FOR HOME,
THE WINDS WILL BE
AT OUR BACK.
WHAT'S GOING TO
BECOME OF US, LINUS?
IT'S UP TO CAPTAIN JONES.
HE'S THE CAPTAIN.
LET HIM TELL US.
CAPTAIN,
WE CAN'T RISK LIVES.
WE MUST TURN BACK.
IF WE CAN FIX THAT BEAM,
WE WILL GO ON.
WE'VE COME TOO FAR
TO TURN BACK NOW.
AFTER MANY HOURS OF DEBATE,
A GREAT JACKSCREW
FORCES THE SPRUNG MAIN BEAM
BACK INTO PLACE.
THERE IT'S SECURED
TO THE TIMBERS.
A POST IS PLACED
UNDER THE MAIN BEAM
TO BRACE IT.
THE MAYFLOWER'S
CAPTAIN JONES
HAS FAITH IN HIS SHIP,
AND THE PILGRIMS
HAVE FAITH IN THEIR GOD.
THEY ALL DECIDE TO
FURTHER RISK THEIR LIVES
TO REACH THE NEW WORLD.
THE DATE IS
NOVEMBER 9, 1620.
IT IS DAYBREAK.
DO YOU MISS
ENGLAND?
I REALLY MISS
MY GRANDMOTHER
AND GRANDFATHER.
BOY, I REALLY MISS
MY FRIENDS.
I WONDER IF THERE WILL BE
ANY CHILDREN IN THE NEW WORLD.
MY MOTHER AND FATHER
SEEM WORRIED.
THIS MUST BE
A REALLY DANGEROUS TRIP.
HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN
ON THIS SHIP, LINUS?
THIS IS OUR 65th DAY,
CHARLIE BROWN.
GOOD GRIEF!
NINE WEEKS!
I'M GONNA HAVE
A LONG TALK
WITH WHOEVER
PLANNED THIS TRIP.
DO YOU THINK WE'RE
GOING TO MAKE IT?
I HARDLY HAVE
ANY STRENGTH LEFT.
CHARLIE BROWN,
WE HAVE TO KEEP FAITH.
A BATH AND NEW CLOTHES
WOULDN'T HURT EITHER.
A LOT OF THE OTHERS
ARE STARTING TO GIVE UP.
THEY DON'T THINK
WE'LL GET THERE.
WE HAVE TO GET THERE.
WHY IS THAT, LUCY?
BECAUSE I HAVE TO LODGE
ALL MY COMPLAINTS
ABOUT THIS
TERRIBLE TRIP.
LAND HO!  LAND HO!
WE MADE IT,
CHARLIE BROWN!
WE MADE IT!
WE DID IT, LUCY!
WE DID IT!
WE CROSSED THE GREAT OCEAN!
POINT ME TO
THE SUGGESTION BOX.
I'VE GOT A FEW CHOICE WORDS
FOR THE CAPTAIN OF THIS SHIP.
GOOD GRIEF.
THEMAYFLOWERHAS ARRIVED.
THE DATE--
NOVEMBER 9, 1620.
SHE FIRST SIGHTS LAND
FROM PLYMOUTH, DEVON.
THE AVERAGE SPEED--
TWO DAYS LATER
ON NOVEMBER 11th
AT 6:30 IN THE MORNING,
THEY MADE
THEIR FIRST LANDING
AT WHAT TODAY WE CALL
PROVINCETOWN HARBOR.
BECAUSE THEY HAVE
NO CHARTER OR RULES
FOR THE WILDERNESS
THAT STANDS BEFORE THEM,
THE PILGRIMS WRITE
AN HISTORIC AGREEMENT
WHICH WILL
EVENTUALLY BE CALLED
THE MAYFLOWER COMPACT.
IT ESTABLISHES THE PLANS
FOR MAKING THE LAWS
IN THE FUTURE.
AFTER
AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT
TO NAVIGATE FURTHER SOUTH,
THEMAYFLOWERRETURNS
TO PROVINCETOWN HARBOR.
THE FIRST GROUP OF MEN
PREPARES TO LEAVE THE SHIP
AND EXPLORE THEIR NEW HOME.
ALL THE BONE-WEARY
PASSENGERS
HOPE AND PRAY THAT
THE WORST IS BEHIND THEM.
OF THE ORIGINAL
TWO HAVING DIED
IN THE CROSSING
AND ONE BABY
HAVING BEEN BORN.
HOW MANY OF THESE PEOPLE
WILL SURVIVE A WINTER
IN THE WILDERNESS
IS STILL IN GRAVE DOUBT.
FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS,
THE WEARY TRAVELERS
HAVE SOME RELIEF.
CLOTHES CAN BE WASHED
ON SHORE
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN TWO MONTHS.
JUNIPER TREES
SUPPLY KINDLING
TO FUEL FIRES
ABOARD SHIP.
THE SMOKE FROM THE FIRES
RIDS THEMAYFLOWER
OF ITS TERRIBLE SMELL.
FISH AND FOWL PROVIDE
DESPERATELY NEEDED FOOD.
EVEN GREAT WHALES,
LEAPING ALL AROUND
THE SHIP,
SEEM TO WELCOME
THE NEWCOMERS.
BUT DURING
THE NEXT FOUR WEEKS,
THE PILGRIMS
HAVE ONE DISAPPOINTMENT
AFTER ANOTHER.
A SMALL GROUP OF MEN
EXPLORES
THE NEARBY WILDERNESS,
BUT IS UNABLE TO FIND
A SUITABLE PLACE
FOR A SETTLEMENT.
WILD ANIMALS
SCREAM OUT IN THE NIGHT.
MANY OF THE PASSENGERS,
MOST OF WHOM
ARE STILL COOPED UP
ON THEMAYFLOWER,
START TO BECOME ILL.
THE FEW EXPLORERS ON LAND
DESPERATELY LOOK
FOR ANY SIGN OF LIFE,
ANY SIGN
OF FRIENDLY INDIANS
WHO MIGHT HELP THEM
SURVIVE.
THEN, SUDDENLY, ONE DAY...
LOOK! OVER THERE!
FOUR, FIVE,
SIX INDIANS AND A DOG!
PUT DOWN YOUR MUSKETS.
LET'S SEE
IF THEY'LL TALK.
WALK SLOWLY TOWARD THEM.
SMILE. SHOW THEM
WE DON'T WANT TO HARM THEM.
OH, NO!
THEY'RE RUNNING AWAY.
THEY MUST BE AFRAID.  QUICKLY!
WE MUST CHASE AFTER THEM!
THE EXPLORERS
TRY TO FIND THE INDIANS,
GOING AT LEAST
BUT THE INDIANS
HAVE VANISHED.
BY THE END
OF THE FOURTH WEEK,
THE EXPLORERS
ARE NEAR EXHAUSTION.
THEY PLAN TO RETURN
TO THEMAYFLOWER
THE NEXT DAY.
A FEW DAYS LATER,
THEMAYFLOWERSETS SAIL
FOR A MORE
HOSPITABLE HARBOR
DISCOVERED EARLIER
BY THE SMALL BAND
OF EXPLORERS.
SEVERAL PASSENGERS
HAVE DIED
DURING THE STAY
AT PROVINCETOWN,
WHICH THEMAYFLOWER
LEAVES ON NOVEMBER 15th.
THEY LAY ANCHOR IN PLYMOUTH
ON NOVEMBER 16th.
ON LAND,
THEY DISCOVER A MIRACLE.
MUCH LAND
HAS BEEN CLEARED,
PROBABLY BY SOME INDIANS,
THOUGH AGAIN THERE ARE
NO INDIANS IN SIGHT.
THERE IS MUCH LAND
SUITABLE FOR PLANTING CROPS
AND MUCH LAND ON WHICH
TO START BUILDING
THEIR SETTLEMENT.
A WEEK AFTER ARRIVAL,
THEY START BUILDING
THEIR COMMON HOUSE.
BUT AT THIS MOMENT
OF HIGH HOPES,
TRAGEDY STARTS TO STALK
THE PILGRIMS.
THE THREE MONTHS
OF FORCED CONFINEMENT
ABOARD THEMAYFLOWER
STARTS TO TAKE ITS TOLL.
THE HARSH WINTER,
FREEZING SNOWSTORMS,
BEAT DOWN ON THE PILGRIMS.
AT LEAST
HALF OF THE ADULTS
LAY SICK OR DYING.
ONLY SIX OR SEVEN ADULTS
ARE EVER WELL ENOUGH
AT ONE TIME
TO CARRY ON THE DAILY WORK.
THE MAYFLOWER
BECOMES A HOSPITAL SHIP.
WHEN THE COMMON HOUSE
IS FINALLY FINISHED,
IT, TOO,
BECOMES A HOSPITAL.
MIRACULOUSLY,
THE 30 CHILDREN SURVIVE,
AND MANY OF THEM
MUST TAKE ON THE CHORES
OF THEIR ELDERS.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
LISTEN UP.
THESE WILL BE
YOUR CHORES FOR TODAY.
CHARLIE BROWN AND LINUS,
YOU GET THE WINTERGREEN
AND THE CHECKERBERRIES.
PEPPERMINT PATTY AND MARCIE,
YOU GET THE KINDLING.
SNOOPY AND WOODSTOCK,
YOU GET THE DRINKING WATER.
SALLY AND I WILL PATCH
SOME OF THESE CLOTHES.
EVERYONE BE BACK HERE
WITHIN TWO HOURS.
AND WHO PUT YOU
IN CHARGE, LUCILLE?
CAPTAIN MILES STANDISH,
THAT'S WHO.
PEOPLE WITH PRETTY FACES
ARE ALWAYS PUT IN CHARGE.
LINUS...
DO YOU THINK WE'RE ALL
GOING TO DIE?
WE HAVE TO HAVE FAITH,
CHARLIE BROWN.
WE HAVE TO DO THE BEST
WE CAN EACH DAY.
I'M REALLY SCARED.
IT SEEMS WE'RE
LOSING ONE OR TWO
PEOPLE EVERY DAY.
THEY'RE STARTING
TO BUILD THE FIRST HOUSES.
CAPTAIN STANDISH SAYS
IF WE CAN JUST
MAKE IT UNTIL SPRING,
WE HAVE A CHANCE.
DO WE HAVE
ENOUGH BERRIES?
I'M FREEZING.
I THINK WE SHOULD
COLLECT SOME MORE.
ON THE OTHER HAND,
MAYBE WE DO
HAVE ENOUGH.
I'M AFRAID
OF THE WOLF, SIR.
FORGET THE WOLVES,
MARCIE.
I'M AFRAID
OF THE INDIANS, SIR.
FORGET THE INDIANS,
MARCIE.
BESIDES, WE
HAVEN'T SEEN ANY
SINCE WE LANDED
IN THIS HARBOR.
I'M AFRAID
OF THE STORMS, SIR.
FORGET THE STORMS,
MARCIE.
WHAT MAKES YOU
SO BRAVE, SIR?
PEOPLE WITH BIG NOSES
ARE NATURALLY BRAVE.
YEOW! SIR!
THERE'S A SNAKE!
YAH!
WE CAN STOP
RUNNING NOW, SIR.
WHY IS THAT?
I MADE IT UP, SIR.
THERE REALLY
WASN'T A SNAKE.
MARCIE!
BUT THANK YOU, SIR.
FOR WHAT?
I'M NOT AFRAID
ANYMORE.
WHY IS THAT?
THE WAY WE RAN AWAY
FROM THAT SNAKE,
I THINK WE CAN OUTRUN
ANYTHING ALIVE.
MARCIE, YOU ARE WEIRD.
WE SURE ARE
LUCKY TO HAVE
CAPTAIN STANDISH
AS OUR
MILITARY LEADER,
EVEN IF HE ISN'T
ONE OF US PILGRIMS.
THAT'S FOR SURE.
HE HELPS
WITH THE BUILDING.
HE NURSES THE SICK.
HE'S EVEN
GOING TO TRAIN US
TO DEFEND OURSELVES.
DEFEND OURSELVES
FROM WHAT?
THE INDIANS.
WE KNOW THEY'RE
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE,
AND THEY CAN
ATTACK US ANY DAY.
I HOPE THEY
DON'T ATTACK TODAY.
WHY TODAY?
I HAVEN'T FINISHED
THE WASH YET.
BY THE END OF FEBRUARY,
TWO-AND-A-HALF MONTHS
AFTER LANDING AT PLYMOUTH,
NO INDIANS HAVE BEEN SEEN,
BUT THE COMBINATION
OF A TERRIBLE WINTER
AND LACK OF NUTRITIOUS FOOD
AND NECESSARY MEDICAL SUPPLIES
HAS BEEN DEVASTATING.
HALF OF THE ORIGINAL
ONLY 20 ADULTS AND
AS THE WINTER CONTINUES
THROUGH THE FIRST DAYS
OF MARCH,
NOTHING LESS
THAN A MIRACLE IS NEEDED
TO SAVE THE FEW SURVIVORS.
THE STRONG FAITH OF
THE SURVIVING PILGRIMS...
IS JUST ABOUT ALL
THEY HAVE LEFT.
EVEN CAPTAIN MILES STANDISH
HAS BEEN HEARD SAYING
TIME MAY BE RUNNING OUT
ON THE SURVIVORS.
IN EARLY MARCH,
THE SURVIVORS
MUST MAKE A DECISION.
SHALL THEY RETURN TO
ENGLAND ON THEMAYFLOWER,
OR SHALL THEY
TRY TO SURVIVE
IN THE WILDERNESS?
AND THEN, A MIRACLE...
LOOK, LINUS.
HE'S NOT CARRYING
ANY WEAPONS.
WELCOME, ENGLISHMEN.
MY NAME SAMOSET.
MY PEOPLE WELCOME YOU
TO OUR LAND.
HE SPEAKS ENGLISH!
WELCOME,
ENGLISHMAN.
WELCOME.
AND WHO MIGHT YOU BE?
MY NAME SAMOSET.
MY PEOPLE WELCOME YOU
TO OUR LAND.
HOW IN THE WORLD DO YOU
KNOW OUR LANGUAGE?
ENGLISH FISHERMAN, MANY
MILES NORTH OF THIS PLACE.
ENGLISH FISHERMAN
TEACH ME SPEAK,
AND FUR TRADERS, TOO.
CAN YOU PLEASE TELL US
WHY THIS LAND HAS BEEN CLEARED
AND WHO CLEARED IT?
WE HAVE SEEN NO ONE.
THIS LAND IS LAND
OF PATUXET TRIBE.
THEY CLEARED LAND HERE.
WHERE ARE THEY?
ALL DEAD. TERRIBLE PLAGUE.
ALL DIED HERE
FOUR YEAR AGO.
EVERYONE DIED?
YES, YOUNG MAN,
EXCEPT FOR ONE MAN.
HIS NAME SQUANTO.
HE SPEAK
BETTER ENGLISH.
I BRING HIM TO YOU
IN TWO SUNRISES.
WHILE THE PILGRIMS
CAN HARDLY BELIEVE
THEIR EYES AND EARS,
SAMOSET TELLS THEM
ABOUT THEIR
SURROUNDING WILDERNESS.
TWO DAYS LATER,
SAMOSET RETURNS
WITH THE INDIAN SQUANTO.
THE PILGRIMS WERE NOT ONLY
ASTOUNDED BY HIS GOOD ENGLISH,
BUT ALSO BY THE STORY
OF HIS LIFE.
I WAS KIDNAPPED FROM
MY LAND HERE BY ENGLISHMEN
MANY YEARS AGO.
THEY TOOK ME TO SPAIN.
FRIENDLY MONKS HELPED ME
TO ESCAPE TO ENGLAND.
I SERVED A WONDERFUL MAN
WHO ALSO HAD ME
LEARN ENGLISH.
THAT MAN FINALLY
GAVE ME MY FREEDOM
TO SAIL BACK HERE
TO MY LAND.
WE NEED MUCH HELP.
MANY OF OUR PEOPLE
HAVE DIED.
MANY OF US FEEL
WE SHOULD RETURN TO
ENGLAND THIS VERY MONTH.
IS THERE ANY WAY
YOU CAN HELP US?
THIS LAND IS THE HOME
OF MY PEOPLE.
I AM THE LAST
OF OUR TRIBE.
I WISH TO REMAIN HERE
IF YOU SO WISH IT, TOO.
LINUS,
IT'S A MIRACLE!
LET'S HOPE SO,
CHARLIE BROWN.
THROUGHOUT MARCH AND APRIL,
SQUANTO TEACHES
THE PILGRIMS
THE HERITAGE
OF HIS FATHERS.
I AM GOING TO TEACH YOU
HOW TO PLANT MAIZE,
AND WE WILL START
BY CATCHING SOME FISH.
BUT WHAT DO FISH HAVE
TO DO WITH PLANTING CORN?
THIS IS THE TIME OF YEAR
THAT THE FISH
SWIM UPSTREAM.
LOOK, LINUS.
HUNDREDS OF FISH.
HA HA.
THEY ARE CALLED ALEWIVES.
WHAT ABOUT
THE CORN PLANTING?
FIRST WE WILL CATCH THEM,
AND THEN I WILL SHOW YOU.
REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE BEST TIME
TO PLANT CORN?
YOU SAID WE SHOULD
PLANT THE CORN
WHEN THE OAK LEAVES
ARE THE SIZE OF A MOUSE'S EAR.
IT IS TIME TO PLANT.
NOW WE'LL DIG THE EARTH
INTO 6-FOOT SQUARES
AND HEAP THE EARTH
INTO SMALL HILLS.
PUT IN TWO OR THREE
KERNELS OF CORN
IN EACH HILL.
AND NOW...
WE PLACE THE FISH
AROUND THE SEED.
WE DO?
WE CALL THIS FOOD
FOR THE PLANTS.
IT MAKES
THE SOIL BETTER.
THE NEXT SIX MONTHS
PASSED QUICKLY.
THERE ARE NO MORE DEATHS.
SEVEN MORE ONE-ROOM HOMES
ARE COMPLETED.
MANY MONTHS BEFORE,
SAMOSET AND SQUANTO
HAD INTRODUCED
THE PILGRIMS
TO THE GREAT
INDIAN CHIEF MASSASOIT
WHO RULED THE INDIANS
OF THE REGION.
CHIEF MASSASOIT
AND THE PILGRIMS
SIGNED A TREATY
OF FRIENDSHIP
AND OF MUTUAL ASSISTANCE,
A TREATY THAT WILL LAST
FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY.
AND FINALLY,
IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER,
THE MOST BOUNTIFUL HARVEST
THE PILGRIM FARMERS
HAD EVER SEEN.
CHIEF MASSASOIT BRINGS
TO JOIN THE 50 PILGRIMS
FOR A FEAST
OF THANKSGIVING.
MAY WE FIRST
HAVE A MOMENT OF SILENCE...
FOR OUR BELOVED SOULS
WHO PASSED ON
DURING OUR FIRST MONTHS
ON THESE SHORES.
NOW WHOSOEVER WISHES
TO GIVE THANKS,
PLEASE SPEAK OUT.
WE THANK THE LORD
FOR OUR BOUNTIFUL HARVEST.
WE GIVE THANKS FOR
OUR NEW HOMES AND GOOD HEALTH.
THANK YOU FOR GIVING US
SAMOSET AND SQUANTO
AND THE GREAT
CHIEF MASSASOIT.
AND WE THANK YOU,
CHIEF,
FOR OUR TREATY
OF FRIENDSHIP.
WE WISH YOU
MANY YEARS
OF GOOD HEALTH.
LINUS, WE HAVE
SO MUCH TO BE
THANKFUL FOR.
AND NOW IT'S TIME
FOR THE CELEBRATION
TO BEGIN.
THERE ARE STILL
A FEW OF YOUR
CUSTOMS
THAT I DO NOT
UNDERSTAND.
